<Ninjazz> eyup.
<WallDives> probably because they use a lot of stock animation.
<Derpy_eliminate> must eliminate Ninjazz
<Ninjazz> o_o
*Ninjazz walks slowly away from chat
*Sylandest1 pokes Derpy_eliminate in the forehead "no touching Ninjazz
<WallDives> so, when something out of the ordinary has to be drawn/interacted, it looks off.
<alexxm> stay Ninjazz
<WallDives> that would be my guess.
<WallDives> Ninjazz: RUN. and dont look back.
*Kipkat07_Gambler pulls out a katana
<Ninjazz> Agreed, WallDives. I always noticed that aswell.

<WallDives> mods are never asleep. just lurking.

<Derpy_eliminate> peace
<Ninjazz> |Discord|: It's not too bad.
<Invi|omnonz> WallDives oh. lol i even know such people
<|Discord|> Ninjazz: But I just don't know how I could make it better.
<Rikku379> im not a weeaboo...not anymore at least
<WallDives> The flaw with them is that they either have never been to Japan, or met Japanese people.
<Ninjazz> |Discord|: Practice.
<Sylandest1> |Discord|: I actually like it as is

<Aurora> I attempted reading homestuck
<GilDash> Ninjazz: They're *normal* abilities. :D
<Aurora> the beginning was so dull that I couldn't get into it
<Iron_Edge> WallDives: Sheesh..this place is a RP cloud..
<Aurora> but I promised myself I'd read it at some point
*Invi twixes
<Aurora> this past january, I said I'd read it during summer
<HyperMetalLugia> ew books :<
<Aurora> I'm reading it
<HyperMetalLugia> dull books
<HyperMetalLugia> are everywhere
<Aurora> its not a book
<WallDives> Iron_Edge, yep. I'm almost willing to take over/under bets on kicks today.
<Aurora> anyways
<WallDives> almost.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I used to sleep like you... :P
<Aurora> I'm thouroughly enjoying it
<Aurora> I'm scared I'm going to be just like the crazy fans who enjoy it
<Invi> WallDives ok i bet with you ^^
<Om> Iron_Edge: The mods hate it when the chat RP's
<drfsupercenter> 03<HyperMetalLugia> ew books :< <- agreed
<Aurora> cuz homestuck's fandom is the worst OTL
<drfsupercenter> 03if there's a movie, let me know

<Iron_Edge> Om: -lol- I can tell. But at the moment it would appear there are no Mods awake.
<Resonantwaves> Hello :D
<Om> alexxm: Its been about a minute long
<Invi> |Discord| but without making sense we wouldn not know what doesn't make sense
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Don't do that... Get sleep. Sleep good. :S

<Aurora> I'm actually amazed you've been on the internet and never heard of it lmao
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Yeah, I don't need anypony to tell me that. :D
<HyperMetalLugia> there are so ,many ways to change the title
<WallDives> also, Hi Om.
<GilDash> Om: Hello. ;)
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe I've avoided most types of insane fandom
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Aurora> it's one of those that you can't 100% avoid
<Invi> |Discord| it depends on the perception ;D
<Sylandest1> howdy Om!
<Aurora> cuz the fans are /everywhere/
<HyperMetalLugia> I've avoided it
<alexxm> i'm good Resonantwaves
<Om> GilDash, WallDives, greetings

<HyperMetalLugia> Ever :P
*alexxm pets Om

<Aurora> you're the anime person, plus you're on DA

<HyperMetalLugia> I haven't touched DA in a year :D
<drfsupercenter> 03same
<Airpuff> GilDash: mhm -.- I hate it
<Invi> |Discord| making sense is too subjective to say that ^^
<Aurora> you've seen the gray people with candy corn horns? or the zodiac signs for that matter
<Airpuff> GilDash: One does not simply eat a normal portion of spicy food..
<alexxm> is it Invi
<Invi> it is alexxm
<alexxm> since when
<HyperMetalLugia> What type of weird religion worships those things o-o
<Petrified_Discord> Boo!
<Angel_Espeon> 13doesn't sound familiar |D
<GilDash> Airpuff: Yes they do. Try a sodding vindaloo. *That's* crazy.

<|Discord|> Petrified_Discord: lawlz suckz for you
<Iron_Edge> lunac: /)
<Om> Airpuff: You try typing upsidedown after you wake up

<Airpuff> Om: what? xD
<lunac> Nothing due in then?
<Airpuff> GilDash: Depends who's makin it ;)
<GilDash> Airpuff: Well, I could if you wanted me to. ;)
<Invi> |Discord| nah i was just watching a PMV ^^ as we in our common world would see that as sense less, people who are used to it would perceive it as not senseless
<Aurora> 6no?
<Aurora> 6well
<WallDives> and yet it doesnt sound like food when you say it, Gil.
<Aurora> 6fanime did have a homestuck gathering
<Aurora> 6it lasted 4 hours
<GilDash> Airpuff: Just don't go for a Korma. I'll never take you seriously ever again if you confess to likeing a Korma. :D
<Aurora> 6they normally last 1
<lunac> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKkQNLmB6g Rainboy eye
<Airpuff> Korma?
<Petrified_Discord> If something isn't senselss, does that make it senseful? :O
<lunac> **Rainboweye
<|Discord|> Invi: Perceptions are differing. Let me just say this. Something that does not make sense to us is generaly funny
<GilDash> Airpuff: It's the pansiest curry ever invented. :D
<Om> WallDives: Gillysuit cant make anything sound wrong
<HyperMetalLugia> Still haven't heard of it
<WallDives> cant?
<Airpuff> GilDash: that bad? xD
<GilDash> Om: You realise that's a double negative. :D
<alexxm> i have farted
<Om> WallDives: Typeing is hard
<HyperMetalLugia> bye AE ;s
<GilDash> Airpuff: Yeah. I will force vidaloo down your throat until you're conditioned if you admit to that. :D
<Invi> |Discord| making sense is just a illusion made by the brain so we are able to handle sensation
<|Discord|> Invi: Dont use that psycological shit on me!
<Om> GilDash: Give me an hour, then my fingers will start working
<Airpuff> GilDash: Okei i just read about it... seriously.... what were they thinking? -.-
<|Discord|> Invi: It hurts my brain!
<Aurora> 6waiiiiiit
<Airpuff> If you're making "spicy" food.. Atleast make it spicy xD
<GilDash> Om: I only need about 10 seconds. ;)
<alexxm> who here knows a gobshite
<Petrified_Discord> |Discord|: You can't hope to defeat your enemy without understanding how they think :)
*Derpy walks up to Discord
<GilDash> Airpuff: I assume they invented purely to weed out the weak. :D

<Sundaysmile> did you get a cookie Gildash?
<Rikku379> she passed on?
<RAWRity> Vordox: Berserk's already on MY list. Trigun's not very controversial. Elfen Lied shouldn't be showed just because it's awful, not because of any controversy.
<Magical_pablez94> Ponies47: i just can't even if i want to. school is in my way. and my parents too.
<Kyu> 07sure it is
<Om|reading> Ninjazz: Now one day some poor soul will be infected with Gilly blood.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03no but seriously
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I pray whoever get's your blood, doesn't become as "fiesty" as you. :$ Can't handle more than one of ya. :$
<Kyu> 07you were just asleep during that part of the lecture
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't even get how you figure out if something is a basis or not
<Ninjazz> Om|reading: I see we were just thinking the same thing.
<Shizuka> 13elfen lied won't get a show cause it's over the top
<Vordox> Elfen Liedd is one of the best manga/anime I've seen O.o
<Kyu> 07by being awake during that part of the lecture
<Kandarihu> RAWRity: I heard a lot of love for Elfen Lied. But I agree that it probably shouldn't be shown here.
<Dark_Horst> magic guitar of wisdom?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
*Kyu runs
<drfsupercenter> 03no but really
<drfsupercenter> 03this homework is due in like half an hour
<Invi> no, wisdom guitar of magic
<Sundaysmile> so that's why music is forbidden?
<Ponies47> Magical_pablez94: I stay up till 1:00 AM on school nights! I'm on summer break now! :D
<Dark_Horst> oh, i see
<ShadowThePony> 6_9 When did this start talking about God?
<LadyCanary> Thank you, Shizuka.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: They'll get over it... ;)
<Sundaysmile> you vanish if you do epic solos?
<Kyu> 07by googling how to find out if something is a basis or not
<GilDash> Om|reading: Hey, if I save a life it's worth it. :)
<RAWRity> Elfen Lied is one of those shows that's just exploitative violence and sex, but tries to act like it's deep or thought provoking.
<SonicTheStallion> Gotta go, bye everypony!~ *hugs and brohoofs everypony, then dashes away*
<Dark_Horst> i still have no idea what this show is about
<drfsupercenter> 03I already did that

<Sundaysmile> welcome to anime Dark_Horst
<VioletGreySha> Night everypony :)
<Shizuka> 13it's an amazing series, but the fanservice and copious blood and gore put it out of the running
<Om|reading> GilDash: Yeah. I suppose.

<RAWRity> It honestly baffles me that people try and get people into anime with Elfen Lied.
<Sundaysmile> wasn't paying a lot of attention here
<LadyCanary> I totally agree Shizuka. Quite overrated. I wonder, would you ever consider showing EVA on stream? I've never seen it ._.
<alexxm> don't worry about it Sundaysmile
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I hope so. ;)

<Dark_Horst> this is my pirate cannon. it shoots whole pirates
<Vordox> THe manga of Elfen Lied is one of my top 10, and that's after 500+ Manga read...
<ShadowThePony> Unvi,Agreed

<grovyleshy_wood> Nyria: I'm showing it to Sumica if he's seen it already. :s
<Irish_Pony> ded
<Aurora> 6why?
<Nick> speaking of myspace I checked it out just now to see what it's like
<Michael> meh that was easy

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumi
<Michael> dat trap
<Shadowabsol> 14I don't know, really. I just kind of feel it happening.
<Dark_of_Max> yay
<Aurora> 6maybe when something better comes out
<Aurora> 6but facebook is pretty solid
<grovyleshy_wood> I kinda want one, cuz she's literally me as a pony, and female.
<Sumica> 00,10bridge crew, hard at work
<Nick> yeah
<Irish_Pony> =_(\
<Nick> rumour is they're getting in on the smartphones business now
<Mish> Huh....how about I let you borrow my AWESOME fluttershy cosplay?
<grovyleshy_wood> :s
<grovyleshy_wood> no
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This reminds me of the first ep of Sealab 2021.
<Shadowabsol> 14I obviously can't explain myself, but everyone seems to be getting into Tumblr and hating Facebook more nowadays.
<grovyleshy_wood> I don't cosplay. Sorry.
<drfsupercenter> 03who is
<Mish> But that green dress looks so Kiwwi!
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf is tumblr
<Nick> friendface
<drfsupercenter> 03isn't that just a site where people post stolen images?
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: This reminds me of Sgt. Frog :P
<Nick> *facebook
<Shadowabsol> 14pretty much
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: you mean I, Quinn?
<Mish> Lol jk, Wear a shirt with flutterhy "attacking" a bear
<geeky-brony> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03that's nothing like facebook :P
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Mish
<grovyleshy_wood> ok mish, I'm lookin on welovefine
<grovyleshy_wood> and next week gonna look at hot topic
<Shadowabsol> 14I'm not saying it's like Facebook, but you would be surprised in the transition.
<Mish> But really, I had the best Fluttershy costume evear, and went to Nortwes con Got 8 brohoofs.
<Irish_Pony> and theyre still in their swim suits :P
<drfsupercenter> 03yes but there are plenty of image sites, like Imgur
<Shadowabsol> 14All of my friends used to talk about Facebook, but now everything is about Tumblr this and Tumblr that.
*Nick sighs its 1am here already >>
<drfsupercenter> 03people who only use Facebook to upload random images are kinda missing the point
<drfsupercenter> 03well
*Michael presses all da buttons
<drfsupercenter> 03remember Google+? :P
<geeky-brony> lol
<Mish> LOL
<Dark_of_Max> XD
<Shadowabsol> 14Who would try to remember Google+?
<icybeauti> Hi guys!
<Om> 3/get me a samich
<Irish_Pony> What was that?
<Sumica> 00,10the ballot was confusing I want a recount
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<geeky-brony> hay icybeauti
<icybeauti> Haya geeky-brony
<Michael> hai icybeauti
<Mish> "theres....this man standing next to this woman, and they are just standing there!:
<drfsupercenter> 03and people like Articuno were all "OMG THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN FACEBOOK, EVERYBODY SIGN UP"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She's a trans. Disqualified.
<Dark_of_Max> hi icybeauti
<drfsupercenter> 03and sent me an invite and stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03nope, nobody cares about it an ymore :P
<icybeauti> Hey Michael and Dark_Horst
<Mish> Stupid line #2
<icybeauti> Dark_of_Max: Hi
<Mish> Hes so horny....
<Kandarihu> This past weekend was the first time in my life that I ever really set foot in a Hot Topic. I was looking for MLP shirts, but I found nothing.
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord Sumica I think Celestia has a new enemy
<Mish> >_< i was going to let this off as a normal contest because it was with full dresses
<Shadowabsol> 14I sort of respect Google+ in a strange way because it's advertising itself on my television screen.
<Mish> COCKBLOCKED.
<geeky-brony> ha wlcom to the frend zone maein cartor guy
<drfsupercenter> 03the way I see it
<Shadowabsol> 14Granted, the ads aren't all that great, but and ad is and ad is an ad is an ad.
<drfsupercenter> 03the LESS something advertises, the better it is
<drfsupercenter> 03look at all the stupid comcast commercials
<Michael> wat nao?
<drfsupercenter> 03and they're complete garbage
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<grovyleshy_wood> *shrug*
<Sumica> 00,10fffffffff I have to take off a bit. Family issue. My brother is being stupid again
<Mish> "Im five foot 2, my faviorte color is blue"= #3 stupid line
<Shadowabsol> 14Are you basing something's greatness off of whether or not it advertises?
<Aurora> 6Academy of Art and Art institute
*Aurora 6rolls
<Mish> Thanks for logic!
<drfsupercenter> 03they don't advertise nearly as much as other colleges
<Irish_Pony> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d50bn5r Hhhhhhhhhhhhnnnnnnggggggggg
<drfsupercenter> 03like Baker and all that
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Obsidian> I know that feeling Sumica
<Nick> Auroroll
<Aurora> 6basically
<grovyleshy_wood> fine Sumica
<drfsupercenter> 03There are obviously exceptions, but the more stuff tries to shove itself in my face, the less likely I am to actually consider it
<icybeauti> Kandarihu: I go to Hot Topic for all my pony shirts. You can look online and get them shipped to your stroe.
<drfsupercenter> 03that could just be me?
<Nick> better than Trollol
<Mish> That entire conversation was to funny to mark as "stupid line"
<drfsupercenter> 03since apparently everybody here enjoys bandwagons
<Aurora> 6the advertising aspect tends to come about mainly because they are trying to get more people, not because they are all powerful
<Nick> or Swiss Roll
<drfsupercenter> 03I seem to be the only one actively trying to stay far far away from them
<Aurora> 6common trend: those who advertise more seem to have less attention
<Nick> or rickroll
<Kandarihu> So there are Hot Topics with pony shirts?
<Aurora> 6for the very same mindset drf just showed
<Mish> not funny
<Shadowabsol> 14I understand where you're coming from, but if I see a good ad then I'll more than likely be interested in what the product has to offer.
<Mish> stupid line #4
*drfsupercenter forces you to watch WideOpenWest commercials nonstop for two days
<Aurora> 6as it stands, facebook has nothing bad going against it other than what was going on with the stocks
<drfsupercenter> 03Now go sign up
<drfsupercenter> 03I dare you
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<geeky-brony> Kandarihu: ya the one at the mall nere me got a carp tone
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, OK
<Irish_Pony> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d51vpaw Dat last frame of fear....
<Aurora> 6yes people hate it, but it's extremely useful for a majority of the population
<drfsupercenter> 03I started playing Minecraft on my own accord and much later than everybody else started telling everybody to play it
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
*kirzstryfe pokes Midnight_Tempest
<Nick> yeah the stocks thing
<Kandarihu> To be honest, there's a closer mall than the one that I went to.
<Aurora> 6did you just start playing like two weeks ago?
<Nick> they were all made overnight million/billionaires
<icybeauti> My hot topic is full of pony stuff. But on second thoguht, I get most of my clothes there anyway, so I go often.
<Aurora> 6cuz people were telling others to play minecraft about 2 years ago
<grovyleshy_wood> anyways
<Nick> then two days on the row stocks fall and they're getting sued if what I last read was right?
<Shadowabsol> 14I try to stay away from the bandwagon, myself.
*kirzstryfe pokes TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Mish> Ithat last panel
<Mish> O_O
<Aurora> 6I would hardly call facebook a bandwagon
<grovyleshy_wood> that last panel.
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<grovyleshy_wood> *shrug*
<Shadowabsol> 14That is, of course, unless someone convinces me to do so otherwise.
<Mish> Bam!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01kirzstryfes
<Aurora> 6my viewpoint on bandwagons is that if there's a use or entertainment, I don't give a rat's ass about the popularity
<Aurora> 6if I enjoy it, i enjoy it
*Mish the streamer is now a hoomin, have fun!
<Nick> hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't say Facebook was a bandwagon
<Aurora> 6facebook, I think it's the most useful thing, I've met up with friends I thought were long gone, from like 12 years ago
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean things like minecraft
<grovyleshy_wood> Well, watching Shakugan no Shana english dubbed. I will say, I can't tell that that's Rarity voicing Shana over there. :s
<Mish> There is no beuty contest
<drfsupercenter> 03like the new stuff htat comes out
<Michael> http://derpy.me/5zrfA dat pic
<Mish> THERE IS ONLY ZUUUUL
<Aurora> 6and even though a lot of my HS friends are across the country
<drfsupercenter> 03and everybody and their brother starts doing it
<Aurora> 6we can still keep in contact
<drfsupercenter> 03and going OMG YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS
<Shadowabsol> 14I'm not calling Facebook a bandwagon -- I have a Facebook -- but I think it's not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be.
<Nick> me personally I'd like to see the things I like become popular, then it means more people to talk about with it
<kirzstryfe> 1,3waaaaat
<drfsupercenter> 03Generally when that happens, I actively avoid wahtever it is
<Nick> hence why we're here!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wuuuuuuuuuuuuut
*Nick runs
<Derpy_Hooves> :V
<Nick> agian
<Derpy_Hooves> hai hai hai
<Nick> again*
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said Facebook was amazing
<grovyleshy_wood> hi?
<Nick> asdgwg
<drfsupercenter> 03Heck
<Michael> hai Derpy_Hooves
<drfsupercenter> 03It took me forever to get around to signing up for that too
<Obsidian> wat
<Shadowabsol> 14It certainly hasn't proven its worth to me, especially with stupid games like Farmville making up a lot of Facebook's population.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Meanwhile as a pony: http://kirzstryfe.deviantart.com/art/Sketch-Meanwhile-305576526
<cachi01> WUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
<drfsupercenter> 03but that one was more because my mom threatening to kick me out of the house if I did
<RyunosukeKnT> so I am breaking down and writing a fanfic
<drfsupercenter> 03well Shadow_Lugia
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03Shadowabsol
<Aurora> 6^then you've got the wrong peple as friends
<Aurora> 6no that wasn't written right
<drfsupercenter> 03join the club, stupid PEOPLE make up a lot of the Earth's population
<Mish> < stupid line #5
<drfsupercenter> 03Facebook has nothing to do with it
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Mish> yah. its kinda obvious.
<RyunosukeKnT> its based off of Sethiso's "a" fic :)
<grovyleshy_wood> Again, gonna make a sketching of my OC for Bronycon 2012. Bitchin'
<Soital> 12Facecrud
*Shimmer watches in awe as Mish turns into a hoomin and leaves for the land of Hoomina
<Soital> 12:D
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 10Kyurem.
<Aurora> 6I guess for social people, facebook tends to be more useful
<Nick> latiii
<Irish_Pony> kirzstryfe: Meh, needs a British Troll
<Soital> 12ICE CHICKEN
<Soital> 12FTW
<Nick> o.o
*Tov|MoatEel is still on the verge of tears.
<Soital> 12Hello~ :D
<Nick> and lati I got the shadow lugia plush
<Tov|MoatEel> This calls for a pizza
<Mish> O_O
<Soital> 12FTW!! Congrats! =D
<icybeauti> Tov|MoatEel: I jsut had pizza lol
<Nick> ty for the images again
<Mish> Fail!
<Shadowabsol> 14Perhaps you're right, Aurora. I haven't been what many would call "social" in these past few years...
<Mish> of course lin won .-.
<Aurora> 6that's efinitely a defining feature
<drfsupercenter> 03<Aurora> I guess for social people, facebook tends to be more useful <- see the funny thing is, I'm the most anti-social you can be and yet I still l.ike it
<drfsupercenter> 03xD
<Michael> bye everypony gotta go bed
<Aurora> 6considering facebook is the /social/ networkl
<grovyleshy_wood> http://oyoyoy123.deviantart.com/#/d51pwxq here's what I have to work with. I think I made his hair too green. :s. He's missing leaf blades and a more badass pose.
<grovyleshy_wood> Night Michael.
<Soital> 12No problem Nick ^^
<geeky-brony> gnighr Michael
*Midnight_Tempest noms kirzstryfe
<Mish> Hes going to die
<Aurora> 6I'm extremely social based which is why I tend to like it so much
<Mish> At least he will be happy
<Shadowabsol> 14I'm also not a complete shut-in. I used to enjoy Facebook as much as the next person. It's just now I don't like it as much anymore.
<Aurora> 6I know a lot of people who don't care for facebook, but admittedly they don't care for socialness either
<geeky-brony> ponys are awesom
<grovyleshy_wood> Is Scoot-Scootaloo around?
<Nick> one thing I like about FB
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Midnight_Tempest, http://kirzstryfe.deviantart.com/art/Sketch-Meanwhile-305576526
<grovyleshy_wood> Is any moderator around? I have a question.
<drfsupercenter> 03well, I hate Timeline, but I found a nice browser plugin to remove that crap
<Nick> it acts as a good way to remember events and stuff since you get invites for them
<Aurora> 6...
<Mish> :|
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03yeah?
<Aurora> 6f*ing timeline
<Aurora> 6can die in a fire
<drfsupercenter> 03you want the plugin?
<Nick> agreed
<Mish> sup Scoot-Scootaloo
<Midnight_Tempest> kirzstryfe: lol, nice
<drfsupercenter> 03what I find hilarious
<Shadowabsol> 14I kind of like timeline...
<Aurora> 6I only like the banner image at the top
<drfsupercenter> 03is that I tried to share the URL on my wall
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yo~
<drfsupercenter> 03and Facebook was like
<Aurora> 6the actual organization of the wall posts
<drfsupercenter> 03"This URL is known for spam, so we've blocked it"
<Aurora> 6there IS NO organization
<SheenaFox> What Aurora said
<Mish> meanwhile
<grovyleshy_wood> Well, this is for anyone, but I clicked the newsletter, waiting for the submissions page, and I can't find it. The lottery's tomorrow night!
<drfsupercenter> 03Spam my a**, they just don't like people abusing their site
<Mish> a pony?!?
<drfsupercenter> 03but anyway
<BlueFlare> 02EWWW TIMELINE
<drfsupercenter> 03www.timelineremove.com
<drfsupercenter> 03enjoy
<Soital> 12Basically, they should let you edit your whole profile layout
<drfsupercenter> 03It actually works too, or I wouldn't be recommending it
<grovyleshy_wood> I'd like to submit my entries, where can I find the place?
<Mish> Whooo! I wanna be a pony...cat :|
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I can see why they don't
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Well you need to be signed up for our newsletter via e-mail
<grovyleshy_wood> oh
<Nick> has the timeline been totally introduced yet?
<Soital> 12having the essentials stuck at the top
<grovyleshy_wood> I'll do that
<Nick> cos my page is still in the old format
<SheenaFox> mine is too
<drfsupercenter> 03that's odd
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03for me
<BlueFlare> 02odd
<Mish> pony video time?
<Skylands> 10[20:19] <Soital> Basically, they should let you edit your whole profile layout <- inb4 Myspace, that was awful
<Mish> :)
<kirzstryfe> 1,3just send an email to bronystate@gmail.com saying you'd like to sign up for the newsletter
<drfsupercenter> 03it was like "Publish now or wait until it becomes live on 5/26"
<Shadowabsol> 14No, Nick. I think they're still giving you the option to switch between the two.
<drfsupercenter> 03so o_O
<Soital> 12never had a myspace
<drfsupercenter> 03Nope.
<Soital> 12XD
<drfsupercenter> 03they don't
<drfsupercenter> 03also
<drfsupercenter> 03sites like myspace did, and I took that and hacked some HTML code together that basically redirected my profile to another page
*drfsupercenter runs
<Aurora> 6acebook is phasing all profiles into timeline eventually
<Irish_Pony> Im thinking of making a animation with my OC
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why the good sites don't you customize
<Mish> good work kirzstryfe , on the drawing
<Nick> ok SA but from what I understand they WILL be enforcing the timeline on all right?
<drfsupercenter> 03though I agree timeline should be an option
<Nick> and lol acebook
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Tov|MoatEel> After talking to Ghosties, I want to change my vote to Cape Fear.
<Nick> I quite like that
<Aurora> 6*facebook
<drfsupercenter> 03just install timelineremove
<cachi01> Irish_Pony: good luck im planning on making one also
<Tov|MoatEel> *A movie*
<drfsupercenter> 03the catch is it does remove that huge banner at the top but whatever
<grovyleshy_wood> ok thanks kirzstryfe
<Shadowabsol> 14I don't think they'll every completely enforce timeline because so many people seem to dislike it.
<BlueFlare> 02EW mySpace
<Nick> I WILL NOW CALL IT ACEBOOK FOREVER MORE COS ITS ACE
<Kandarihu> Is it okay if I suggest a documentary for B movie?
<drfsupercenter> 03it at least shows everybody's pages in the classic wall format
<drfsupercenter> 03Shadowabsol, >humanity
<Aurora> 6SA
<drfsupercenter> 03you'd be surprised.
<Aurora> 6it's happening already
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<cachi01> Irish_Pony: and its haaaard :(
<drfsupercenter> 03mine already changed :/
<Aurora> 6a lot of people have had their profiles force switched
<SheenaFox> mine hasn't yet
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<SheenaFox> but it will
<Aurora> 6it's been going on for like 6 months
<Nick> ah
<drfsupercenter> 03SheenaFox
<SheenaFox> eventually >.>
<drfsupercenter> 03go log in
<Nick> thought so :\
<drfsupercenter> 03and look at the top
<drfsupercenter> 03of your page
<drfsupercenter> 03it should say a date
<drfsupercenter> 03that it'll switch
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<Aurora> 6I voluntarily switched so I could design my banner image
<Shadowabsol> 14I never noticed because I chose to make mine into timeline.
<Tov|MoatEel> Only if its a science docu *not a mod*
<SheenaFox> o_o;
<Nick> I might delete my profile when mine get's switched
<drfsupercenter> 03does it not show a date?
<drfsupercenter> 03mine did
<SheenaFox> hold on lol
<Aurora> 6drf, if it's far enough, the don't display a date
<drfsupercenter> 03it said 5/26
<Aurora> 6*they
<drfsupercenter> 03you sure?
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Aurora> 6mine never did
<geeky-brony> mmm
<drfsupercenter> 03mine let me choose to publish it
<drfsupercenter> 03well
*Mish is holding a mod
<Aurora> 6I just siwtched cuz I could
<Mish> Awww'
<drfsupercenter> 03<Aurora> I voluntarily switched so I could design my banner image
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why it didn't show a date
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Mish> :'<
<Aurora> 6but my friend had one and it was for like 2 weeks from that day
<cachi01> i want a documentary abut the dangers of eating money
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean if you intentionally DON'T do that
<Aurora> 6drf
<grovyleshy_wood> done and done
<Aurora> 6it didn't show a date BEFORE
<Aurora> 6duh.
<BRBick> I AM PEN
<drfsupercenter> 03They only started showing the date a week ago...
<BRBick> (goes now)
<grovyleshy_wood> I know what I'm doing for a B Movie
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6no?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes?
<Irish_Pony> cachi01: what program you use?
<drfsupercenter> 03for me at least
<Aurora> 6thats been happening for a while...o_O
<grovyleshy_wood> and an A Movie too
<Aurora> 6like i said
<drfsupercenter> 03well then
<drfsupercenter> 03they must hate me
<Aurora> 6they're doing it in phases
<drfsupercenter> 03but everybody does, no surprise
<Mish> No stream?
<SheenaFox> fb isn't loading for me atm
<grovyleshy_wood> and the two episodes
<cachi01> Irish_Pony: well its an IRL animation so im using fter effects
<Aurora> 6people have been forced over since march
<Tov|MoatEel> A documentary on the guy who walked that tightrope was… tight.
<cachi01> after
<drfsupercenter> 03weird
<grovyleshy_wood> and Mish: nope, Sumica has "family troubles".
<SheenaFox> other sites are loading normally but I can't load fb
<Aurora> 6once your profile is scheduled for a switch, it'll give you a date like 2 weeks prior
<Aurora> 6is what I'm guessing
<SheenaFox> oh there
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Aurora> 6sheena
<Aurora> 6same with me
<Mish> did...somthing happen?
<SheenaFox> there's no date
<SheenaFox> okay not just me
<Shadowabsol> 14Why do they need timeline? I like it and all, but I also like having an option.
<Mish> oh noes!@\
<Kandarihu> Well, I tend to have obscure tastes, so my perpetual suggestion of A movie might not come across as an A movie to a lot of people. It technically is.
<drfsupercenter> 03because they're stupid
<Mish> A moive: a good movie that is well known
<Shadowabsol> 14It won't hurt Facebook to have both layouts available.
<drfsupercenter> 03SheenaFox you went to your own wall, not the news feed?
<SheenaFox> yes
<SheenaFox> I did
<SheenaFox> lol
<Mish> B movie: a not so known movie of good quaility
<drfsupercenter> 03and Shadowabsol, again, you're assuming that 99% of humanity has common sense.
<drfsupercenter> 03Sadly that's not true :/
<ShadowThePony> Hello everypony :)

<Biglaw> I've been drawing!
<Reikim> cachi01: Final Fantasy always has good tunes. 13's battle theme is one of my favourites.
<MYCUTIEMARKISAGUN> four cds, geez
<cachi01> ikr
<Reikim> Dat waltz time, right?
<WallDives> Reikim: I though I was one of the few.
<Reikim> WallDives: Say what you will about 13, the soundtrack was as good as ever.
<cachi01> Reikim: ff13 main menu theme promise is one of my faves
<Reikim> cachi01: The true theme song of the game.
<cachi01> yay the game!
<WallDives> Reikim: I'm agreeing with you, everyone I know craps on it, and most of the game.
<WallDives> I see more saw. Time to see more deaths.
*MahBoi777 gives Failuane a ball-in-a-cup
<Darkts3> explains Saw
<Reikim> Wait, what game is this?
<Failuane> thanks MAHBOI
<cachi01> FF-13 is awesome and no one can deny it
<SirGanjalf> ALL of 'em!
<WallDives> cachi01: by FF standards, 13 is mediocre.
<MahBoi777> Failuane: ur welcome lol
<cachi01> WallDives: yeah but instead of comparing it to the other FF games
<cachi01> its pretty cool!
<Reikim> FF V is and will always be my favourite.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Reikim
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Am I audiable?
*Reikim sneezes
<WallDives> cachi01: comparing to other games, its a JRPG, and among JRPGs, its alright, not spectaular, as a FF game is expected to be.
<RustyMeat> Whats this game?
<Dark_of_Max> saw???
<FillyFlam> Nittany_Discord: You're a little quiet, I think.
<Gunthler> Nittany_Discord: Ponies! :D

<mycutiemarkisagun> cachi01 everyone annoys Hulk
<Dan_> rainbow dash thought pinkie pie was annoying at first
<hen3ry> no. If the Hulk found Pinkie annoying, Pinkie would force him to smile. Thus defusing his power.
<Reikim> Also, whoever decided that darkness makes games better should be forced to sit in a completely light-proof room.
<WallDives> Failuane, you never played Dark soulds, have you?

<mycutiemarkisagun> thing
<Reikim> Om: Clearly you haven't been on Bronystate long enough. We don't need to be drunk to be drunk.
<druminpony> cant tell if he is crying or loling
<hen3ry> sugar is best high
<Shadowabsol> 14Seeing as how not all of the clocks literally read the time it most clearly produces.
<WallDives> and one more for good measure : The original Family guy Comics.
<cachi01> who would win sumerpan or bamtan?
<Om> Reikim: You caught me, I havent been here for a very long time.
*Dark_of_Max ''i gona die''

<CupcakeWarrior> Too bad no one is recording this

<Reikim> Seriously, who designed this game?
<SayWhat> The kids always fight over which is better... the xBox or PS3, then the smart ones get PCs
<WallDives> Reikim, Konami, obviously.
<WallDives> SayWhat, if you play fighters, you HAVE to play on console...
<cachi01> xbox = ps3 < PC
<SayWhat> Well, that's a given WallDives

<CupcakeWarrior> cachi01: If it was Sumerpan 64, it would have been much better
<WallDives> GameCube comes close, mostly because of PSOEP1&2+

<Reikim> Clearly the way to cure self-imposed isolation and suicidal tendencies is by piercing a guy's body with metal spikes. Jigsaw's logic is infallible.
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: Yeah it should. But before I go and get it. How did you get the dragon age armor? That stuff looked pretty awesome.

<Sumica> 00,10baldness must be an issue in france
<Shizuka> 13i don't use roseluck anymore, more stable without her .-.
<Monfang> However, I"m of the mindset that the Government can't do anything right.
<SunderlandPony89> I'd still perfer to live in France over the US
