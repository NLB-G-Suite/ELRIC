<Chains> WHAT
<sagas> Randomnerd: I dont think that would do anything...
<Randomnerd> It was pretty random -it didn't get hurt, obv. It just lost its balance.
<Deadlypon3> What if Twilight kneed Big Mac in the groin?
<sagas> Rain: Shizuka
<Ninjazz> My guess is Shizu...
<Deadlypon3> Doesn't that make you giggle
<sagas> giggle at the nut shot!
<Brony103> deadlypon3 I would laugh.

<Deadlypon3> Oh Yeeaaah...
<TheWhitePlague> Hello sub06905
<Alister> Randomnerd: What I'm saying is that society tolerates and sometimes encourage attack on male genitalia, but will condemn and severly punish the situation with genders reversed. Violence is Violence. It should always be condemned
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
<Brony103> flying flaming heads!
<sub06905> oh look its doom 3
<Randomnerd> Not really, I'd rather not hurt people like that. Women have a pile of nerve endings down there.
<RAWRity> Alister: to be fair, I find it funny when a woman gets punched in the boob too
<Deadlypon3> ....Hey guys, do ya think that 20 years from now, we will be complaining about MLP going down the drain after season whenever :P?
<sagas> Alister: Honestly I would laugh at a woman getting punched in the boob
<Om> BLAM!
<Rain> I wub woo, Shizuka :3
<TheWhitePlague> Alister: On the delts scale getting kicked in the groin is the same amount of pain of havin 130 children
<sagas> Alister: Or kicked in the vagina
<Brony103> stupid people hurting themselves or other people is funny.
<sagas> TheWhitePlague: Now that is some bull shit...
<TheWhitePlague> Sagas: Google it
<Randomnerd> I don't watch enough TV. Maybe I would find it funny.
<RAWRity> You know what's funny?

<Alister> RAWRity sagas violence can be a part of comedy , but when we make only violence on males acceptable. we create a moral standart that males are dispensable
<Brony103> BOOM!
<Rain> TheWhitePlague, giving birth is equivilant pain to breaking 25 bones at the same time :|
<Randomnerd> Like I've said in the past, I don't watch much television.
<hen3ry> no person in history has both given birth and had testicles to be kicked. So we do not know for sure

<Chains> KICK
<Chains> LOL
<sub06905> or get kicked while giving birth
<Alister> :|
<hen3ry> There are endorphins that are released during childbirth that help with the pain of that... somewhat. But obviously not enough to make it non-painful for most women.
<Yahooz|SailX> double kick
*RAWRity begins plans for attaching testicles to a pregnant woman.

<Brony103> Speeking of giving birth... my cus had a baby!
<Chains> Seriously.
<cachi01> oh look science!
<hen3ry> Bronysith: I'll buy that. But I can't testify to it personally, natch.
<FillyFlam> "Violence to the Genitals" sounds like a song by a Cannibal Corpse tribute band.
<Randomnerd> Ugh. I've talked about this too much. I really don't give a toss.
<TheWhitePlague> It doesnt hurt more, but Delts wise it measures up more.
<Randomnerd> Is this Doom 4?
<cachi01> FillyFlam: its a good name for a porno song
<TheWhitePlague> Take in mind being kicked in the balls is quick
<sagas> TheWhitePlague: You link a discussion board?
<TheWhitePlague> While labour takes hours.
<hen3ry> I'm just saying that there are endorphins released... it would be even worse without them, or for people whose endorphin receptors are shot
<cachi01> Randomnerd: 3
<TheWhitePlague> Sagas: Meh, I just took the first hting on google
<RAWRity> I'm just gonna come out and say that, while getting kicked in the coconuts is no ballpark, I think having my insides involuntarily contract and then shove a tiny person out of a 4 inch hole in my pelvis sounds more painful.
<hen3ry> which is why most women choose to have a painkiller during the process.

<Alister> RAWRity: Getting kicked in the balls too hard can result in fainting and having to chirurgically removing them
<Chains> C'mere! http://www.gbrower.com/Audio/BNSF%20-%20Maximize.wav
<sagas> Chains: yes?
<RAWRity> Alister: Giving birth can lead to TEARING YOUR VAGINA.
<RAWRity> also, death
<Chains> >: D
<Bronysith> RAWRity: but dont you get something out of it? a newborn child
*sagas backs away from the tracks as he watches the train approach from a distance
<RAWRity> so yeah, still going with childbirth for more painful.
<Alister> RAWRity: Doctors generally try prevent this
<Brony103> y u buffer!
<panda> Rawrity :( you still mad at me?
<RAWRity> Bronysith: which you then have to try to raise for 18 years.
<Chains> Which is more painful, being kicked in the vagina or 9 monthes after having homosexual sex?
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5abi0sscH1rw314so1_500.jpg
<sub06905> 0-0
<hen3ry> ... wot?
<RAWRity> Alister: and guys generally try to prevent getting kicked in the nuts.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: right. thats why you plan on childbirth and not have sex until you are financially prepared
<Brony103> I wouldn't know...yet.
*sagas backs away from the tracks and watches Chains train go bye
*Chains passes saga "GOD DAMNIT :("
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kidney stones are more painful than either.
<pyrocatboy> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5c0clqYkm1rs7yllo1_500.jpg
<sagas> I agree with Nittany_Discord
<hen3ry> this conversation is starting to climb on the "this hurts" list.
<TheWhitePlague> My friends mom told him she had kidney stones
<TheWhitePlague> Rofl
<RAWRity> Bronysith: not just about finances. Do you have any clue how stressful just taking care of a child is? LITERALLY EVERYTHING CAN KILL THEM.
<panda> Nittany_Discord, no.... gallstones are worse!
<RAWRity> YOUR HOUSE CAT COULD EASILY AND HAPPILY KILL YOUR BABY WHITHOUT TRYING
<Bronysith> RAWRity: yea. i kknow....
<sagas> Im gonna say ancient chinese torture is the most painful
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01panda: Dunno. I've had kidney stones, but not gallstones.
<Alister> RAWRity: Here is how I see it. Unless she was raped. the womand had a choice wether or not if she wanted a child. When you make a choice , you have to take responsiilities. Otherwise , a violent attack breaks the principle of non-infraction
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And tiny stones sent me to the hospital from extreme pain.
<Chains> Okay, I've got ANOTHER suprise for you, saga! http://www.hecticfilms.com/downloads/sound%20effects/Misc/6_68.WAV
<sagas> Chains: yes?
<TheWhitePlague> http://www.blogadilla.com/2010/02/18/the-science-of-losing-your-manhood/
<panda> Nittany_Discord yeah... did you have to piss em out?
<sagas> Chains: Is that a motor cycle?
<Alister> brb
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<cachi01> RAWRity: a kick in the balls is equivalent to 9000 dels which is equivalent to giving birth to 160 kids and breaking 3200 bones at the sam time
<Chains> sagas: Chainsaw. http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg839/scaled.php?server=839&filename=happysaw.png&res=landing
<Ninjazz> Nittany_Discord, Owch...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But mine were fragile, so they passed painlessly.
<TheWhitePlague> See
<RAWRity> Alister: ...the fuck are you talking about? This isn't about how something is more fair or whatever the cock you're talking about. it's about which is more painful: a swift kick to the nuts, or SHOVING A PERSON OUT OF YOU THROUGH A HOLE THAT IS ALSO PART OF YOU
<TheWhitePlague> Told you kicked in the bals is 160 kids
<Om> Thats good.
<RAWRity> cachi01: the fuck are "dels"?
<TheWhitePlague> Rawrity: http://www.blogadilla.com/2010/02/18/the-science-of-losing-your-manhood/
<cachi01> RAWRity: is a way to measure pain
<panda> Nittany_Discord, you got lucky ^-^ my dad has to piss his out and they were the size of marbles
<Bronysith> SWITCH TOPICS FOR THE LOVE OF MOLESTIA
<hen3ry> a del is the amount of pain necessary to cause a troll to erase one word of a posting.
<RAWRity> cachi01: ah, so it's one of those bullshit things that people make up to sound smart. Got it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's when they drop from your kidneys through your utera (tube btw kidney and bladder).
<cachi01> RAWRity: lol i think so xd
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01PAIN!
*sagas drives away in Chains car as Chains chaces him running and flailing a chainsaw
<TheWhitePlague> RAWRity: You arent love and tolerating
<Alister> RAWRity: My original topic was actually hoe society will laugh at a kick in the balls but scream in shock at a kick in the vagina
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially if those stones cut things on the way down.
<Alister> how*
<Diglett> hello
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: imagine a paper cut in your holes entrance
<cachi01> RAWRity: lets say 22 hrs (birth.. i know its up to 30 hrs but its up to less too so i choose mid) and 10 minutes (kick - from 1 to 20 minutes i guess) it gives us forbirth: 57x22x60x60=4514400 total amount of pain takenkick: 10x60x9000=5400000 total amount of pain taken
<Chains> BLARGHRAGHURGHAGURGHAGH!
<Chains> >: D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: I've had kidney stones. Enough pain.
<hen3ry> Alister: yes, there is a double standard - violence by a woman against a man is funny, the opposite is repugnant. There are many double standards.
<RAWRity> cachi01: that sure is a whole lot of bullshit right there.
<panda> Nittany_discord, well, then you can endure anything!
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: ....owie. FUCKING OW
<cachi01> RAWRity: xd actally its copypasted lol :3
<ponibas> Nittany_Discord: Shhh
<Merc_Xephos> fat fuck
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is endurance
<RAWRity> cachi01: it some copypasted bullshit then.
<TheWhitePlague> RAWRity: Also put into fact that some women put baseball bats up there vaginas in there spare time
<hen3ry> copypasta BS still smells as bad
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: isnt that the male equivalent of giving birth?
<cachi01> RAWRity: xd
*sagas laughs out the window while driving just fast enough to stay out of Chains reach
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<pyrocatboy> Wow, all this caused by me?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes, but more painful.
<BroKnee> wubwub
<BroKnee> >.>
<Bronysith> pyrocatboy: /) smooth moves
<Chains> ):<
<hen3ry> ... you know what, Imma walk away from this conversation. So.... uh.... ponies?
<Merc_Xephos> i going on youtube.com
<RAWRity> TheWhitePlague: also put into consideration that a baby if much wider than a baseball bat, and excretion is severely more difficult than insertion.
*Chains continues flailing the chainsaw wildly
<TheWhitePlague> We should watch My Little Investigations
<Bronysith> LETS TALK ABOUT PONIES FOR THE LOVE OF CELESTIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Shizuka> 13so
<Shizuka> 13how bout them demons
<TheWhitePlague> Rawrity: They also do it to there anases.
<Ponies47> ^
<pyrocatboy> I am now proud to say that I may have started a very minor flame war.
*Ninjazz agrees with Bronysith
<Bronysith> Shizuka: demon poniEs?
<hen3ry> Ponies are cute.
<Chains> :(
<sagas> Shizuka: What about them?
<Om> Bronysith: We don't talk about ponies around these parts.
<hen3ry> Demon ponies are less cute
<Alister> Bronysith: Yes let's talk about ponies. I like that pony that molests other ponies. Having fun yet ?
<Brony103> Zombie Ponies!

<Sylandest> MahBoi777: how about yourself?
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: U is for Uranium bomb!

<Shizuka> 13fine
<Shizuka> 13sorry folks
<DashWithRainbows> SaxyPretender same here. It was a good game since they mixed things up with armour abilities, but, some of the weapons were too OP, like the human sniper. Halo 3 was way better both story and multiplayer-wise. I would love to see assassinations in halo 4 again and they should bring pack the beam rifle. That thing was beast. Oh, and dual wielding
<geeky-brony> SaxyPretender: agred

<Polydunami> They make me happy :>
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: i can appreciate a good creepy song...but when im sleepy, i can get a wee bit paranoid :$

<BroKnee> I LOVE YOU
<geeky-brony> BroKnee: lol
<junh1024-XD> <LobsterHime> I agree. Fascination with the moon landings was passive; it might have kindled people’s imaginations but what tangible benefit did it bring to their everyday lives? Apple’s retina display and deeper Facebook integration make the banal more interesting, and the isolated more social.
<Dken2021_> otakon I guess, but it is a nice, soft kind of anger
<junh1024-XD> jajaja
<Om> Ooh, what is this song?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> BroKnee lol your not gonna get by any arrows,are ya? jk
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> *get hit
*Vinyer puts a pony on junh1024-XD's nose
<hen3ry> True story. My little brother is blonder than blonde, and as a little toddler, we were on the beach in Spain. A couple young German kids, perhaps 4-5 years old, came over, and asked my brother if he wanted to play with them. First time my brother had ever heard German, he thought they were yelling at him and he started crying
<Midnight_Tempest> russian is more angry than german otakon...
<otakon> Dken2021_: well, maybe in VioletVanilla's case but she doesn't speak German around here.
<sub06905> according to Captain America feelings are for Women and gay children
<junh1024-XD> the pony has fallen off already
<BroKnee> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I sure hope i don't get any more, they hurt
<MahBoi777> this song is beautiful
<Vinyer> lol
<diddutz> hen3ry: lol
<otakon> sub06905: the HELL you say, feelings are GOOD. The Captain would agree with me.
<Om> Ninjazz: Now this is some smooth music.
<Polydunami> And so God gave to the British the dominion of the seas. To Spain he gave the rule of the land. The Germans he gave reign over the clouds.
<MahBoi777> err music:$
<BroKnee> Whats the name of this song>?
<BroKnee> I MUST LEARN TO PLAY THIS ONE
<geeky-brony> Generals gathered in their masses Just like witches at black masses Evil minds that plot destruction Sorcerers of death's construction

<otakon> MahBoi777: that is GOOD.
<BroKnee> What is the name of this song? Plz respond

<MahBoi777> bye Diglett!
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: NO
<Ponies47> geeky-brony: :(
<Midnight_Tempest> lol mash... i liked that show, Radar was awesome
<MahBoi777> M*A*S*H:D
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: lol jk
<Ponies47> Never seen M*A*S*H :$
<Kencolt> Pizza Pie. Pinkie's rarely spoken of cousin, because he HATES pastries and is ALL about the savory.
<Ponies47> geeky-brony: :)
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: (\
<Polydunami> Yeah, I was thinking of the episode where Radar types up his report in a very narrative way xD
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: /)
<Midnight_Tempest> M*A*S*H was an old comedy TV show as well as a movie... the movie was far more serious though
<LewisJenkins> I've never seen M*A*S*H. :P
<MahBoi777> either one was good
<Dken2021_> never knew there was a movie
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Kencolt lol now my love for pizza wants me to be that pony :D
<Kencolt> Midnight_Tempest: Oh, at times tyhe TV show beat the movie out on grimdark MAJOR. espefcially during the finale.
<BroKnee> :o
<Polydunami> "The friendly, hot sun showed his friendly, hot face over the mountains of purple majesty, as if he was salutating good morning to all."

<xxMoopyxx> Is this by MicTheMicroPhone?
*Ninjazz still isn't sure if he likes Tombstone's voice or not
<Polydunami> I have most of the episodes of M*A*S*H memorised because I would always watch them with my late grandmother
<Om> Ninjazz: Its specific aplication
<otakon> xxMoopyxx: I think it's LivingTombstone actually
<xxMoopyxx> oh ok
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ninjazz, I CANNOT stand tombstone
<CrimsonPhoenix> voice
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> xxMoopyxx lol i heard his Berry Punch's Druken Telegram! :D
*StupidSexyCJ doesnt like tombstone's voice
<LewisJenkins> :3
<xxMoopyxx> heh
<Polydunami> That.
<Midnight_Tempest> MicTheMicrophone is more of a rapper than a straight up singer like this
<Ninjazz> :S
<Ponies47> The only thing really I like MicTheMicroPhone is his fanfic readings. So I don't have to read the fanfic :P
<StupidSexyCJ> he reminds me of the singer of The smashing Pumpkins
<Ponies47> *thing I really
<LewisJenkins> I actually didn't like rap before the fandom. Now I love it.
<Kencolt> Midnight_Tempest: The original novel, you know-- MASH-- was basically, a composite of actual MASH incedents compiled from personal testimony. In other words, it was more a semi-documentary than a comedy-- the surgeons DID that stuff to keep from going totally insane.
<otakon> Kencolt: eeyup
<Polydunami> Yeah, it was the MASH 8055 in real life
<SuperBrony64> 11,12I love MASH :)
<Ponies47> Like I said never seen M*A*S*H :$

<Ponies47> Ohai SuperBrony64 :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,12I have every season on DVD
<OtakuTom> And now you've made me think of one of my favorite episodes of The Simpsons, StupidSexyCJ (and no...not the one based off of your name, though that one's also good :P)
<Polydunami> Me too, SuperBrony64 :3
<Shamroc> oh hai SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,12I wouldn't mind streaming the episodes if ponies wanted to watch it :3

<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: So does my grandpa
<Polydunami> SuperBrony64: This.
<Ponies47> That: Me to
<Dken2021_> ohai SuperBrony64
<MahBoi777> hey SuperBrony64! that'd be awesome
<Midnight_Tempest> Kencolt: indeed... thats what made the show good, its something that anyone would have done in their situation
<OtakuTom> I'll watch it.
<geeky-brony> edrtfyguhikswerdtfvybuhmjokzsexrcftvybuhmjok
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> that sounds neat
<Ponies47> Like I said never seen M*A*S*H :$
<Kencolt> It was often a BIG problem for the brass. Most career soldiers could NOT get their heads around the simple fact that Doctors think DIFFERENT than soldiers, and that for most, ranks were an annoyance.
<StupidSexyCJ> lol i dont watch the simpsons, I want to though, can never catch it on television when its playing
<SuperBrony64> 11,12But for now…I'm tired…night all ^_^

"As the prince opened his eyes, he found himself starig into the eyes of a cockatrice, the prince's legs grew stiff and eventually he became encased in stone.The nameless prince of the dark forest stood there frozen in time for years to come." wat do ya think

<Polydunami> Anyway... a random thing.
<xxMoopyxx> yup
<Polydunami> I just said that
<OtakuTom> Too Much Time On My Hands :3

<Polydunami> In the meantime, ponies.
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: thats what i siad good muisc
<Polydunami> And youtube.
<MahBoi777> way to plan ahead Polydunami
<OtakuTom> The problem with "good music" is subjective, not objective, geeky-brony
<xxMoopyxx> hey did that guy pick up on the phone?
<geeky-brony> OtakuTom: ?
<MahBoi777> there's alot of good music
<Polydunami> I mean, who knows? My death could occur earlier... but I don't want it to.
<MahBoi777> but I prefer rock
<Eddmario> You're STILL working on this?
<OtakuTom> "good music" is a matter of opinion. For example, I could think that a specific genre is good that you don't.
<StupidSexyCJ> geeky-brony: he means its more about personal preference
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: like Aerosmith
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I don't work as fast as Wrek :'(
<xxMoopyxx> really dud really
<Eddmario> Country music is worse then Justin Beiber
<MahBoi777> Polydunami: if it happens it happens I guess
<geeky-brony> StupidSexyCJ: oh ok
<Spriggals> AJ all the way
<Polydunami> Eddmario, there are good country pieces.
<geeky-brony> kirzstryfe: why sad u stuff is awesome
<Polydunami> ... I can't think of one right now :S

<Eddmario> *Georgia
<xxMoopyxx> just because you did that..................................waow yeah your cool dude..........................teh whatever :|
<OtakuTom> Yea, there's also always the couple of songs from each genre that stand out. For example, I don't like Country music, but there's still a couple songs (older ones, specifically) that I still like.
<geeky-brony> oh ......... noooo
<Polydunami> Okay, name at least three Justin Bieber songs. Or at least three that you like.
<mutterguy_> Ummm Does Ghostrider or Cony count or are they trucker rock?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Awww shit
<kirzstryfe> 8,6justin beiber doesn't count as a genre
<mutterguy_> *Convoy
<Eddmario> Polydunami I was saying that except for those 2 songs I named that Country music is TERRIBLE
<OtakuTom> Wait...you mean me, Poly? I've never listened to him, and he's an artist, not a genre
<Polydunami> I mean, three GOOD Justin Bieber songs
<StupidSexyCJ> Justin Beiber is best genre
<xxMoopyxx> i hate Justin Bieber dude
<geeky-brony> Polydunami: :D lololol your funny
<kirzstryfe> 8,6let's check the itunes here...
<Ponies47> *explodes because Justin Beiber was said*

<CrimsonPhoenix> some country can be good
<OtakuTom> Okay...maybe 'artist' was the wrong word...he wants to be a singer...key phrase is "wants to be"
<xxMoopyxx> cause some of my friends hate justin bieber
<mutterguy_> wait no...
<OrangeFrosting> country music is good when youre wasted
<Eddmario> That moment when a Justin Beiber cover is better than a Sheryl Crow cover...
<OrangeFrosting> and thats about it
<Shamroc> question: xxMoopyxx can you spell wow right? cause everytime I've seen you type it....it comes out waow.
<Ponies47> *explodes because Justin Beiber was said*
<Polydunami> "I hate Justin Bieber because my friends hate Justin Bieber and I want to fit in because it's cool..."
<xxMoopyxx> justin bieber is a no life long neck crow
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: noooooooooooooooo
<StupidSexyCJ> Ponies47: Justin Bieber! Haha! I know your weakness!
<MahBoi777> Peer Pressure is bad mmkay?
<Eddmario> If you compare it to Sheryl Crow's version, Justin Beiber's cover of the Guns N Roses song "Sweet Child O' Mine" is okay
<geeky-brony> Polydunami: i dont hate jb i just haet the muisc
<Polydunami> I don't hate Justin Bieber, actually
<Ponies47> *explodes because Justin Beiber was said*
<Polydunami> Boom
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: nooooooooooooooo whyyy
<OtakuTom> The only version of Sweet Child O' Mine worth listening to is the one by GNR XP
*StupidSexyCJ also doesnt hate Justin Bieber
<MahBoi777> same
<Ponies47> *respawns*
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: yay
<Spriggals> Do you have rolling stones
<CrimsonPhoenix> I think Justin Bieberis ugly
<GrimGallop> I'm not a big fan of country, but, unlike Bieber, there are a few things I can stand to hear from time to time.
*mutterguy_ is too apathetic to hate most of the time
<Ponies47> I can explode as much as I want and never be ded! :P
<geeky-brony> Mutterguy: most

<Polydunami> Hey
<Ponies47> *Explodes*
<Ponies47> *respawns*
<OtakuTom> I haven't listened to Bieber, so I have no opinion either way about him. I've heard a parody or 2 of his songs. That's the closest I've been to listening to him.
<OrangeFrosting> mmmm

<OtakuTom> Yea, BronyState's been around for just over a year.
<MahBoi777> Shamroc: ah

<Polydunami> Yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> heck not even
<Viri> 14hello
<geeky-brony> Pink_Ponies47: i like staying gray black and read thanks
<GabeMoist> Bronystate was made before there were bronies
<OtakuTom> I first joined BronyState during the season 2 premiere.
<Polydunami> I joined after The Last Roundup
<CrimsonPhoenix> OtakuTom, that's pretty early I believe
<CrimsonPhoenix> I joined right after MMM
<OtakuTom> It was about 4...maybe 5 months after the site started up.
<CrimsonPhoenix> when Coraline was playing
<GabeMoist> What was MMM?
<MahBoi777> I joined in October I believe
<Pink_Ponies47> geeky-brony: Okie doki loki. *Starts jumping like Pinkie Pie* Hmm strange couldn't jump like this before
<Polydunami> Right, babelfish.
<Pinkies4thWall|Xbox> I joined just before season 2 started

<Pink_Ponies47> Hi Candy_Mane I'M PINK! :)
<MahBoi777> gnight Bluestrom_S
<OtakuTom> But yea...CrimsonPhoenix...you should see my ideas for humanoid robots. The only thing that's keeping me from making them now is how poor conversation AI is.
<Polydunami> The end of January of this year was life-changing to say the least
<geeky-brony> Pink_Ponies47: thats cuz your a were-pinky
<BroKnee> eddmario nopes :/

*DeathStar dances under geeky-brony s feet
<geeky-brony> DeathStar: yay
<xxMoopyxx> sorry i was being a troll i had to go to the garage and chilled out for a minute and came back all nice again
<Sumica> 00,10such as still a better love story then Twilight
<Pink_Ponies47> Ohai DeathStar. I'M PINK!
<OtakuTom> You could always use some of the more generic jokes, like a couple of the names from Space Mutiny, or Normal View.
<DeathStar> Pink_Ponies47: why are you pink?
<Polydunami> Maybe ponified references to famous MST3K quips.
<GabeMoist> Sumica, making progress already
<Polydunami> Apparently, ponified should be pooshoes to my spellchecker.
<geeky-brony> R.I.P Kurt Cobain
<pony_931736> hello

<DeathStar> hello pony_931736
<xxMoopyxx> ok im going back to my paint program i'll let you know when im done ok

<OtakuTom> This is still Styx playing through the stream, Poly. I don't know what you're hearing ^^;

<Pink_Ponies47> DeathStar: Yeah. So now I'm pink. I really don't mind. But I just wonder how I change back?
<geeky-brony> DeathStar: DINER
<OtakuTom> Yea, depending on what program you use to stream with, you can always adjust the size of the image. I use XSplit, which allows me to put in images with transparencies, so I could use just the base image and not the Desktop Ponies app.
<geeky-brony> R.I.P Kurt Cobain.
<DeathStar> Pink_Ponies47: try dancing it solves everything
<xxMoopyxx> ok so if i draw a stick figure how do idraw hat that hes wearing backwords?

<Om> I never assume.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Thanks for the stream kirzstryfe ~
<FairysHuff> Pwah: A lesson I've learned is to simply not give a damn what people think and just enjoy what you enjoy. Lifes too short to care what others think of you.
<Pwah> FairysHuff: I'm gonna be 20 but I look like 16 or 18 lol
<Applejazz> I only know cause I played l4d2 with him. x3
<StupidSexyCarambola> nice work sub06905
<FairysHuff> Pwah: Sounds cliche I know but it took me years to figure out it's true ^_^
<Pwah> FairysHuff: I hear that! :)
<mario_pony> i feel weird
<mario_pony> my mom made me shave my afro
<FairysHuff> Pwah: LOL I will be 32 in July and I am like 12 at heart. LOL

<Ponies47> ohai Jim :)
<sub06905> Tnx StupidSexyCarambola, Otakutom for the complements on my tile :$
<mario_pony> Ponies47: it took me 6 months to grow it
<OtakuTom> Okay...for anyone who was interested, I found the video of me singing White and Nerdy...weird to think that this was almost 6 years ago now... http://youtu.be/QD2Y2GAVH6g
<FairysHuff> Pwah: For example I am going to buy myself a Kimono for the summer and wear it outside. I will get comments maybe even attacked but yah know what EFF people ^_^

<KiwiBoi777> mario_pony: I wudn't have given up mah afro without a fight
<mario_pony> OtakuTom: lol where were you?
<FairysHuff> Pwah: Thats hard to do. The child becomes more covered in jaded fatigue over the years not matter what we do.
<Jim> mario_pony: I also cut my hair the other day
<Jim> From really long to quite short
<OtakuTom> We were in line for the Wii launch at Meijer (the only place that was letting us stay inside because it was about -10 degrees out that day (or at least felt like it)
<Pwah> FairysHuff: I wish I was less self-conscious so I wouldn't be afraid to express myself :(
<Ponies47> I haven't ahd my hair cut in a while :P
<Ponies47> *had
<FairysHuff> Pwah: Don't get me wrong. I am very self-conscious. It's about fighting through that to do what you want rather than whats expected of you.
<FairysHuff> Pwah: It's not easy. Not at all but it makes you feel better.
<StupidSexyCarambola> gtg, later yall
<OtakuTom> See you later, StupidSexyCJ
<trollhunter> bye

<Applejazz> Damn... forgot to say bye.
<Om> Applejazz: bye?:$
<OtakuTom> I keep refreshing the stream in hopes that someone takes it over...ll

<KiwiBoi777> mario_pony: it's nothing, it just leads to a stream without a chat
<FairysHuff> Pwah: Oh don't worry about that. I still avoid crowds, traffic, loud noise etc. It's more about doing what you like and ignoring others.
<Vordox> Pwah: Tell then you like the show for it's quality, and try to convince her to see atleast 4 eps
<Ponies47> I wish I had some My Little Pony T-shirts. But I'm saving for a new computer right now :<

<FairysHuff> Pwah: I was thinking about it. I haven't had breakfast yet. But to be honest I don't want to. Am lonely ^_^
<Viri> 14oh, I heard that one of american's mobile service is going from 30$ monthly for unlimited internet to 50 for 1GB
<Viri> 14is that real? o_O
<sharpshooter> hi
<mario_pony> hi sharpshooter
<Ponies47> mario_pony: IKR? But my computer is so slow and old. It's about 10 years old so it's better I just save now :<
<drfsupercenter> 03depends on the company

<Viri> 1450 dollars for 1gb is INSANE D:

<Ponies47> FAIRY'S!
<Ponies47> FAIRY GODPARENTS! FAIRY GODPARENTS!
<mario_pony> Ponies47: i know how you feel
<FairysHuff> Ponies47: Huh?
<Ponies47> mario_pony: eeyup :<
<Depressing_Rain> we need some stream
<Rain> nah
<MysteryPony> Hello everypony!!!
<Ponies47> FairysHuff: Just being random AGIAN!
<mario_pony> hi MysteryPony
<Rain> I like it when there is no stream
<sharpshooter> i kinda new to this so what do we do basicly
<Rain> chat :|
<Ponies47> Hello MysteryPony! What's the mystery?
<sharpshooter> well that simple
<Vordox> Now just waiting for Phase4 ....hur hur hur...
<Viri> 14I pay 13Eur monthly for 200MB and 50 minutes of free callings and unlimited SMS with people with my same mobile service + unlimited calls with one number
<Depressing_Rain> om nom nom the clouds\
<FairysHuff> Pwah: Thats another thing I forgot to mention. DON'T be afraid to admit how you feel. If you feel lonely say so. If you like somone say so. Etc. Life is too short to observe social rules of others ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02indeed
<Viri> 14too bad I had to undo that because I had to save money xP
<MysteryPony> Ponies47 cake!
<FairysHuff> Ponies47: FairyFluff ^_^
<Ponies47> MysteryPony: LO
<Rain> so if I feel like slapping someone, do it, FairysHuff?
<Depressing_Rain> anyone here remember Brony4Life?
<Ponies47> MysteryPony: *;O
<Rain> I hardly think that is a good thing
<Ponies47> :O
<Pwah> FairysHuff: yeah :3
<FairysHuff> Rain: Thats an action not a feeling ^_^ lol
<Pwah> lawl derp
<Ponies47> So Phase4. You gonna stream?
<sharpshooter> what is friday movie night
<Rain> so if I feel like someone is ugly and they should know about it, I should tell them?
<Pwah> movies shown on friday night.
<sharpshooter> what movie we going to watch
<MysteryPony> Lets dance!!!
<FairysHuff> Rain: As long as your not mean about it yes. I believe in absolute honesty in everything.
<Vordox> sharpshooter: Usually each week end we have a Movie night, Euro is on Saturday, US is Friday, Where we show 2 movies of lottery chosen ones, and 2 eps of MLP
<sharpshooter> well that cool
<Depressing_Rain> screw logic
<Pwah> Element of Honesty!
<junh1024-XD> rrrora
*MysteryPony is doing the "you son of a b"¤56"
<Depressing_Rain> hey you should uh stream that would be uh cool
<FairysHuff> Far too many people in the word lie to others and themselves. I find honesty to be very freeing.
<Rain> Depressing_Rain, who could stream?
<Pwah> Mhm!
*Vordox is grinning like Twi waiting for phase4 to join Terraria so we can advance the server. :)
<Depressing_Rain> Rain: Charlie Sheen could
<MysteryPony> FairysHuff: i hope you dont mean that! without lies i wodent have any friends!
<Rain> no he couldnt, because he is not a bronystate moderator/techie
<Pwah> lawl charlie sheen
<Depressing_Rain> its Charlie Sheen he needs no reason
<mario_pony> Chuck Norris could stream
<hen3ry> Charlie Sheen is had +o in his veins. That's his tiger blood type
<FairysHuff> For example I will share something with everyone here that only my friends know. I have tried to take my own life 3 times in the past. Tis a simple matter of fact I don't expect any sympathy or want any.
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Phase4> 00,02code merged
<Phase4> 00,02reboot time
<Rain> he may not need a reason, but he would still have to be a mod/techie to be allowed to stream here
<Depressing_Rain> WOOT
<trollhunter> phase4 has a terraria server
<Depressing_Rain> Rain: stop using logic
<Rain> then why tell people, FairysHuff? :|
<Depressing_Rain> ill join the terraria
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: sounds rough
<FairysHuff> Rain: An example of both honesty and of not caring what others think.
<MysteryPony> Rain: dont rain on peapol parades!
<Pwah> :O
<Rain> if you didnt want any attention for it and it was indeed a simple fact, then you could have went your entire life without telling anyone about it
<Depressing_Rain> mysterypony: you just ruind the mood
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Meh, it is what it is. I'm not the only one in the world nor do I pretend to be ^_^
<hen3ry> there was a mood?
<mario_pony> lol
<Depressing_Rain> henr3ry: there was
<MysteryPony> i become to Honest when driking! so i dont drink!
<FairysHuff> Rain: Thats your perception of social rules. Not mine. Everyone is different.
<hen3ry> all I sensed was a silly filly argument about whether Charlie Sheen would be able to stream (he totally could, unless Chuck Norris had the stream first)
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: just because there are hundreds of thousands of people trying to do it, it wont become less rough/serious though.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03going to bed
<trollhunter> phase4 I would love to goin your tarraria if you'll have me
<Depressing_Rain> to be totaly honest i have never smiled
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: You mean millions ^_^
<mario_pony> Depressing_Rain: i find that hard to believe
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: or millions, you get my point :)
*Spectrum_Plush falls outta chat
<Rain> I have some stuff about me that I dont care what people think of it, but I dont go just saying it randomly. If someone asks, sure, but if they dont, then why bring it up?
<MysteryPony> Depressing_Rain: THis looks like a job fot PINKIE PIE!!!!
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Yes ^_^
<MysteryPony> *for
<Depressing_Rain> hey phase4 you shud tell me the terraria server's name
*Ninjazz sighs
<Phase4> 00,02Depressing_Rain, its Vordox's server
<Vordox> Wait whut?
<Depressing_Rain> ok
<Phase4> 00,02now wheres that button
<Vordox> Oh
<Depressing_Rain> port?
<Ponies47> *explodes*
<MysteryPony> FREE CAKE!!!
<FairysHuff> Rain: I was using it as an example. I could have used something else but it's something I'm still not sure of so I couldn't be entirely sure if I was being honest with it or not.
*MysteryPony starts handing out cake!
<Vordox> Depressing_Rain: If Phase wants to play Terraria it goes up :P
<MadSurge> Rain: exactly. That's my approach for anything "inconvenient" I like :D
<trollhunter> can I goin your tarraria phase4
<hen3ry> mun get.
<hen3ry> now to figure out how to actually land safely on it...
<Ponies47> *explodes*
*mario_pony explodes..Twice!
<Ponies47> :O
<hen3ry> you can't do that. It's not scientifically possible. YOU are not scientifically possible!
<Rain> Im thinking of changing my nick to Zoltan or some shit, because 96% of all pings that come from here are "chocolate rain" or weather related. 3% come from other users using nicks with Rain in them, .5% come from tab fails, and .5% are actually directed at me
<mario_pony> You're not scientifically possible!!
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: it must be a great a feeling. Not caring what others think about you. I still want others to respect me so I have to put on a mask for them. Sort of.
<hen3ry> Oh drat.
*hen3ry disappears in a puff of logic
<Pwahy> i'm back!
<Alchemist> Rain: Zoltán?
<Phase4> 00,02oooo
<Phase4> 00,02windows patch day
<Phase4> 00,02thats allways fun
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: I've found that people will think what they want to think of you no matter what you do to try and please them. So why bother stressing yourself out over it? Just be yourself.
<Pwahy> FairysHuff: are you a girl fairy?
<Rain> anyway, havent slept in 3 days and have to be on a roof at 8am. Im going to atleast /try/ to get some rest

<Phase4> 00,02i think you did
<Wrek> 05last thing i remember i was downtown abusign the open bar
<Vordox> You were chatting here yesterday when Shizuka streamed Doom 3
<Wrek> 05oh she streamed doom3? awsome, from the start or were she further in game already?
<Shimmer> Wrek was drunken chatting? Awww and I missed it :(
<Applejazz> Damn... I don't think I was paying attenion. >_<
<Applejazz> attention*
<Ascendant> lolol
<Vordox> From the start,,,ish
<Lighty> 13went to school, saw this BIG spider in my locker
<Lighty> 13nope
<Om-oldbean> You cant type very well drunk wrek
<Lil_B> h everyone
<Applejazz> Hello there, Lil_B. :)
<RoboGerbil> hmm wow 8 am already :( i just got home from work
<Lil_B> hi RoboGerbil
<Lil_B> thanks apple ;)
<RoboGerbil> hi Lil_B
<Lil_B> Applejazz*
<Applejazz> :)
<Applejazz> aka Ninjazz
<Shimmer> Om-oldbean: He doesn't type well when he's sober either ;D
<RoboGerbil> ugh.. i dont want to waste all morning sleeping.. but i gotta apartment shop today
<Hat> Can I join on TF2
<Lil_B> I had that sneaking suspicion Applejazz
<Applejazz> It's that obvious? :D
<Hat> Don't punch Rarity!
<Applejazz> ^
*RoboGerbil punches rawrity
<d3rb> kick, more effective
<Lil_B> Applejazz its the Jazz part ;)
<Om-oldbean> Shimmer: I can still read it xD
<Applejazz> I thought so. :D
<HyperMetalLugia> So like, I installed mint onto it :c (BSOD at boot on Vista, but fail)
<Wrek> 05Shimmer: its called typos
<Wrek> 05speed typing causes them xD
<glennglog22> hi
<Applejazz> I still make typos when typing at regular speed. =__=
<Lil_B> wrek so yesterday was "speed typing" the cause of unreadable sentences as well?
<LoyalDash> Oh, hello everypony.:)
<Chrysalis> damnit Phase4
<Om-oldbean> Thats fine, but when every other word has a j in it. Gets hard to read xD
<Phase4> 00,02lol

<glennglog22> hi
<Applejazz> Hello there, glennglog22.
<Shimmer> Sure sounds like you drink like a viking, but do you hold your liquor like a viking too? That's what I wanna know :)
<RoboGerbil> liters? who uses the metric system... really...
<d3rb> normal people :P
<Lil_B> Metric FTW
<LoyalDash> I thought every country in the world uses the metric system except for the US.
<d3rb> kph>mph
<RoboGerbil> yeh every other country is wrong

<Om-oldbean> I like metric better.
<LoyalDash> RoboGerbil: I live in the States, but it is harder to follow the U.S. measuring system.
<Angel_Espeon> 13also hai all, to anyone who's here xD
<d3rb> metric makes more sense but if i used imperial for long enough im sure id be attached to it
<Wrek> 05USA is the new roman empire
<Om-oldbean> With bigger catapults
<RoboGerbil> meh.. the only reason the us doesnt use the metric is every schematic since forever is still in imperial units
<Wrek> 05and it was ther oman empire that caused the fall opf the roman empire
<Applejazz> Long Live the President of the United States.
<Lil_B> Wrek will it get conquered by the huns?
<Wrek> 05roman*
<LoyalDash> Let's take length measurements. It makes sense that it converts 1000_=1_, but in the US, it always varies.
<Wrek> 05but atleast you have orgies and vomitariums to look forward to
<Applejazz> Great... =__= More fun.
<Om-oldbean> Hura!
<d3rb> someone has seen eddie izzard
<Monfang> Guys, I need help
<Monfang> PC tech help
<Shimmer> If the US is the new roman empire I call dibs on Sparta
<Lil_B> i call dibs on germania
<Applejazz> Hello there, Monfang. I don't think I can help you there, though.
<Monfang> Anyone here know anything about PCs specificly Laptops.
<Shimmer> Yeah
<Shimmer> 'Laptops suck
<Monfang> I turned mine on this morning and was meet with one long loud beep.
<Lil_B> Monfang just tell us the problem and we will try by the best of our abilitys
<RoboGerbil> Monfang: careful what 'help' you get on PC's from the interwebs
<Shimmer> It's dead, buy a desktop
<Lighty> 13hai
<Hat> The manual says what the beeps mean
<Wrek> 05sounds like something essential is not connected
<Monfang> It was like DeeeDeeeeeDeeeeeeDeeeeDeeeeDeeeeeDeee
<Lighty> 13insteaad of hey
<Lighty> 13Navi should say Hai
<Monfang> Well I'm using it right now
<d3rb> weird
<Monfang> I left it on for a time and it eventually stopped.
<RoboGerbil> 1 long beep is cpu error
<Alchemist> Monfang: could be the memory dislodged.
<Lil_B> Monfang so its NOT aone long continous peep?
<RoboGerbil> looks like 2 short 2 long?
<Monfang> Well I can hear where it, how should I put this, bounces up. But there is no stop to it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I ended up being half an hour late to my exam today LOL
<Om-oldbean> Rub some bacon on it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I was given an extra half an hour to make up for lost time but I didn't really need it in the end
<RoboGerbil> the beeps will be in patterns (sually 4 beeps in the pattern)
<Lighty> 13what subject?
<Shimmer> Too vague info, need more than that
<Angel_Espeon> 13Sociology :P
<d3rb> the beep gradually gets faster you mean?
<Monfang> No. It stays steady.
<Lighty> 13easy :3c
<Monfang> And it was more than four of the 'D' in the beep
<Lil_B> Monfang is there anything else you noticed? (Performance drops etc.)?
<Monfang> Or maybe I should say 'B'
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah pretty much xD
<Lighty> 13OPINIONS OPINIONS OPINIONS HATE HATE HATE
*Lighty runs
<Angel_Espeon> 13;3
<Angel_Espeon> 13also, wall of pink
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<Monfang> I just now got it to turn on. When It first started ot happen, I did a hard shutdown.
<Monfang> I did notice it didn't go to a login screen.
<Lighty> 13pink ftw :3
<d3rb> ok....i have no idea but i think if you havent already hit up google, look up your make and model and swearch for the symptoms you got, failing that maybe email the manufacture
<Lighty> 13and green, electyric/light green
<Hat> Have you got a manual
<RoboGerbil> nope, hes got a virus.
<d3rb> until them.....back up as much as you can
<Monfang> I tried that, but mine is the only PC that is accessable and runs good.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm iffy with green, I only like certain shades of it xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13like the one that has a bit of blue in it too
<Monfang> A virus RoboGerbil? What gives you that idea?
<Pinkamena> .
<Hat> Hi Pinkamena!
<Lighty> 13like, lightybree-green? :3c
<RoboGerbil> Monfang: lately viruses have been attaching to the boot sectors of hard drives
<pony73385> hi
<Monfang> I have Avast! so should I do a full scan?
<pony73385> II didnt realise
<d3rb> hey pony73385
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not so much xD
<pony73385> pinkamena was denied name
<RoboGerbil> if he has a current os that doesnt allow boot sector changes, the comp will fail to boot
<Lil_B> Well, when the PC works normaly now, and has no performance Problems, then I think we can cross out Hardware-Problems, so yeah, something in the Software (Virus or a bad Driver) is probably the cause
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey Lighty, Windows is great for art, programming, games and everything else too :>
<Monfang> Well it booted after a long time of attacking my ears.
<Lighty> 13ahw >:
<Lighty> 13and i know hyper :3
<pony73385> xchat
<HyperMetalLugia> and for power
<Lighty> 13games ftw~
<Monfang> When it got to the Window Logo, it beeped one more time.
<HyperMetalLugia> no you didn't
<HyperMetalLugia> you said yesterday
<pony73385> Look im on the stream :D
<Hat> What is the model of the laptop
<Chrysalis> dat cygwin
<HyperMetalLugia> that it wasn't for that
<Monfang> Emachines 825e I think
<pony73385> lol laptop
<pony73385> i have a gaming computer
<Chrysalis> Phase4 how come you have different people coming up in different colours?
<HyperMetalLugia> same with *nix* being only for power and/or Mac being for graphics
<RoboGerbil> Monfang: you said you have another pc? update the virus scanner on that, then strap the hard drive from your not working pc to your working pc and scan it
<Monfang> pony73385: I'm lucky to have a roof over my head and food in my belly. So shut up.
<pony73385> i love you too
<Lighty> 13i didnt say "only" did i? .-.
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, makes it easier to read
<Lighty> 13but "good for" the are all good at certain things, and worse at others
<HyperMetalLugia> it looks liked you did
<Monfang> They are all Laptops and none of them are as good as mine, RoboGerbil
<Lighty> 13your vision looks different then someone else's
<Monfang> eMachine E525 is the make and model?
<HyperMetalLugia> And your vision of OSes is a bit narrow
<Monfang> Oh wait!
<Lighty> 13my vision of OS's is wide and pure, inb4: don't go bahw because you cant afford it/dont like the company/plainly dont like it
<Monfang> For some reason, even though it was plugged in, my laptop's battery died. Would that have anything to do with it?
<Monfang> And my battery isn't charging...
<Monfang> Oh hell, It's dead isn't it?
<HyperMetalLugia> No, but you complaining about Linux not being in stores shows that you don't know the entire story behind it lol
<Monfang> No wait, there it goes.
<Phase4> 00,02i like dis remix
<Lighty> 13i have the right to complain
<d3rb> thats a good indicator you may have a battery problem or the terminals are not making contact or something similar
<Lighty> 13and i might not know 100% of everything
<Lighty> 13but you dont either
<Lighty> 13so
<Lighty> 13shuddap and listen to this
<HyperMetalLugia> I can let you buy Ubuntu 12 for 100$

<d3rb> sounds power related at least
<RoboGerbil> Monfang: when your pc is booting (right after you pres the power button) tap the f8 key repeatedly till a menu shows up
<Ascendant> oh god ubuntu 12
<HyperMetalLugia> Would you like to buy it
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Monfang> So maybe I take it out, clean it and put it back in and see if that fixes it, d3rb?
<HyperMetalLugia> > yet it is perfectly free
<HyperMetalLugia> Except for Unity
<Lighty> 13then i yarrharr/get it free
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad customisation
<Monfang> RoboGerbil: I actually can't do anything with the keys. I tried that but as long as it beeps, nothing works. The screen is frozen at the logo and the key shortcuts.
<HyperMetalLugia> very bad unity ;-;
<Ascendant> I'll buy Mint 15
<Lighty> 13first reshearch, then buy :3
<RoboGerbil> if you see the logo you missed it already
<Ascendant> like ,now
<Ascendant> like, now*
<Ascendant> lol
<Monfang> I see the Emachines logo
<Monfang> At the bios boot
<Ascendant> my life is currently a fustercluck of BUSY
<Ascendant> fml maths test tomorrow
<Monfang> *eMachines
<d3rb> take out the battery and inspect the terminals on the battery, if they are clean dont worry about cleaning, if they appear dirty give them a light cleaning but im not sure what with, to be sagfeju st use something dry like a cloth or i dunno
<HyperMetalLugia> I know right ascendant
<Ascendant> plane geometry, circle geometry AND linear functions
<HyperMetalLugia> all my finals are likenext week :|
<Ascendant> fml
<HyperMetalLugia> thurs-fri
<HyperMetalLugia> EW
<Ascendant> yeah same
<Ascendant> fml
<Angel_Espeon> 13Good luck Ascendant :3
<Monfang> Godo thinking d3rb
<HyperMetalLugia> tues-fri :c
<Hat> When you start up, does it say the model of the motherboard
<Ascendant> I don't get
<Ascendant> circle geometry
<Ascendant> AT ALL
<HyperMetalLugia> I hate geometrty
<Ascendant> and linear functions
<Ascendant> fml
<HyperMetalLugia> mr*geometry
<HyperMetalLugia> me niehtr
<Ascendant> I hate geometry too
<Ascendant> fmllllll
<HyperMetalLugia> FIND TEH TRIANGLE IN TEH SQUARE
<Ascendant> I can do graphs
<Ascendant> that's easy
<HyperMetalLugia> Then you gotta find ANGLES
<d3rb> unless you remove the battery regulary i would be more inclined to suspect a faulty battery though...keep in mind im just taking stabs in the dark here
<Monfang> No, Hat. It shows the eMachines logo with the F2 and F12 shortcuts for the bios at th ebottom.
<Ascendant> but I hate proofs
<HyperMetalLugia> And then MORE angles
<Ascendant> and I HATE trigonometry
<HyperMetalLugia> then lengths
<HyperMetalLugia> Then proofs
<HyperMetalLugia> and fun stuff :<
<BlueFlareon> 02geometry is awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> If you're Jack Black
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't see when you'd need that stuff in life at all unless you're going to be a mathematician
<Hat> In the BIOS it might say what model it is. I'm trying to find which motherboard the laptop has so I can see what the beep code is
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't even know if I spelled that right LOL
<Lighty> 13i have proof i am the son of chuck norris ya know
<Lighty> 13there was this door that had "PULL" all over it
<Lighty> 13i PUSHED it open
<RoboGerbil> d3rb: a faulty battery wouldnt cause the computer to fail to boot, it would jhust throw a bios error saying something about system bater
<BlueFlareon> 02it depends AE
<BlueFlareon> 02there's a few majors that need it
<Lil_B> and suddenly windows forced a restart on me :/
<BlueFlareon> 02that most people will never do
<d3rb> yeah true, still cant hurt to check the treminals even if its unlikely, its a free potential fix
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL exactly ;3
<RoboGerbil> lol run for the hills! the windows fail is sporeading
<d3rb> just leave the terminals in the laptop itself Monfang
<HyperMetalLugia> maybe the netherlands door installer visited amsterdam before he installed it
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<BlueFlareon> 02XD
<d3rb> i <3 my pc
<d3rb> rock solid
<d3rb> now i have sealedits fate, it will be dead in a week :D
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try sniper
<Lighty> 13thats nothing
<Lighty> 13there was a "push" and "pull"
<Lighty> 13sign, on a automatic sideways doors
<Lil_B> Monfang one possibility is (if your battery really isn't charging any more) is that the Beep was caused by a Hardware faulire because the battery is dead, what would explain why everyone else is still working very well
<RoboGerbil> no Phase4! its a trap!
<Monfang> It's charging now Lil_B
<Lil_B> Monfang than forget this idea XD
<Shimmer> d3rb: I chose a 670 instead of a 570 for my new pc :)
<d3rb> muahaha...the power!
<d3rb> im a bit jelly
<Shimmer> You're gonna be jelly when I buy the 2nd 670 and put it in as well
<Lil_B> I want a new PC, probably with Ivy Bridge
<HyperMetalLugia> they were high in netherlands while installing doors
<HyperMetalLugia> scary europe
<Lighty> 13no
<Lighty> 13more like fail store
<d3rb> i want amd to stop sucking so hard and make some competition for intel
<RoboGerbil> meh.. nothing my crossfire 5770's cant handle yet
<Lil_B> d3rb they fucked up Bulldozer really bad :/
<OtakuTom> Hi everypony! I'm back :D
<Lil_B> hi OtakuTom ;)
<d3rb> i know, i was certain it would be the perfect upgrade from my phenom 2 but nooooooo
<d3rb> wb OtakuTom
<Wrek> 05im just happy with my soon year old 580
<Wrek> 05it crashes deus ex from time to time
<Shimmer> http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2012/06/12/demotivational-posters-there-are-plenty-of-fish-in-the-sea-2/ bahaha truth just got told
<Wrek> 05but everythign else ios stable
<Lil_B> My current PC has 3GB DDR2 RAM and Dual Core XD
<Chrysalis> thanks for the heals there
<RoboGerbil> my current system (epenis war)
<TheRandomkid321> There are ALOT of thinsg you should never google... ALOT!
<d3rb> hell yeah Lil_B , ddr22 ftw
<d3rb> 2*
<Shimmer> TheRandomkid321: And when you get to my age, you will have googled it all
<Monfang> Ok, I passed my problem onto a tech support site and I might even try contacting my uncle. He's A+ Certified and all that..........D'OH! My A+ Book! It covers what those sounds mean!
<TheRandomkid321> Shimmer True
<d3rb> google image search killed my inner child
<Lil_B> d3rb and I'm even running Vista, sometimes I don't know why it actually runs so well XD
<RoboGerbil> before we had google image we have webferret
<Shimmer> Lil_B: The biggest malfunction on your pc is vista
<d3rb> lol vista...i had that for a year or so, didnt see what everyone problem was but i had a few service packs on it
<Monfang> though I think I got rid of it a long time ago. T.T
<RoboGerbil> lol they dropped support for vista BEFORE they dropped support for win 98
<Hat> The motherboard is Intel Mobile GL40 Express but it's hard to find the beep codes for intel laptops
<Om-oldbean> I see sunlight.
<Lil_B> what is the actual problem people have with Vista?
<Shimmer> Om-oldbean is now dubbed "Killer of chats"
<Applejazz> Om-oldbean, time to crawl into your coffin, dude. :D
<d3rb> it was garbage on launch Lil_B
<RoboGerbil> Lil_B: it used 2 GB memory idling
<Wrek> 05Monfang: pålease do tell if you figure out the error
<Om-oldbean> Shimmer: I've been killing chats since forever
<Monfang> I will do Wrek
<Om-oldbean> Applejazz: Its about time indeed. Getting to bright for me to be up
<Lil_B> ok, so i have 3 Gigs of slow ram, of which 2 GB are just in use for the OS?
<RoboGerbil> Lil_B: thats right
<d3rb> maybe
<Applejazz> You really are a vampire pony. :$
<Applejazz> Night, Om. Take care. :)
<Hat> Even though these are the desktop codes, they might be the same. http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-010249.htm
<Om-oldbean> Applejazz: I don't need sleep yet.
<Shimmer> Lil_B: When vista came, most in my class back then chose to get it installed on their school laptops.. a few of us geeky kids chose to stick with xp, and we laughed our asses off when it took like 3 mins for those with vista just to boot
<Om-oldbean> Just gota finnish this chapter...
<d3rb> Lil_B: bring up task manager and see how much ram is getting used atm
<Applejazz> Just don't get burned from the sun.
<Om-oldbean> Applejazz: I am wearing a pony shirt, I am invincible
<Applejazz> Om-oldbean, lucky.
<Lil_B> currently in use: 1,25 GB of Ram
<d3rb> that alright
<d3rb> thats*
<Onyxia> ohai
<Onyxia> ;p
<RoboGerbil> when I ran vista I saw a huge increase in performance when i slapped in 4 gb ram and turned off the page file
<Applejazz> Hello there, Onyxia.
<Lil_B> Shimmer I once meserued how long it takes for my PC from pressing the Start button to actuall beeing able to open the first folder: 40sec
<d3rb> opera you fat piece of crap resource hog....WHY ARE USING HALF A GIG OF MEMORY
<RoboGerbil> d3rb: you watching the stream in opera?
<Lil_B> d3rp thats why i dropped Opera :D
<Lil_B> ho Onyxia ;)
<d3rb> streasm in one, chat in one, and about 7 tabs in another....ok kinda makes sense
<Shimmer> Lil_B: Well it has received some updated in approx 6-7 years, of course it should be faster now :p
<Shimmer> Lil_B: But especially when it came it was a joke
<RoboGerbil> Lil_B: what os you running to get 40 sec boot?
<Lil_B> RoboGerbil Vista... but I really have nothing on autostart, I have my PC free of any unnaccecary Applications
<RoboGerbil> got the system restore turned off?
<Onyxia> i somehow love this music part
<Om-oldbean> BANG!
<OtakuTom> Windows 7 on my SSD goes through a full shutdown and restart in about 40 seconds.
<d3rb> damn, nice
<RoboGerbil> my computer used to be fast booting, then i p[ut steam on the boot lol
<Lil_B> Shimmer but at least Win8 will come out soon, and it will be worse, WAY WORSE than Vista has ever been...
<dr-whooves> Hay guyz
<Shimmer> Lil_B: Hence I'm sticking with my w7 <3
<d3rb> oh hai dr-whooves
<dr-whooves> Win 8 is nuce
<Lil_B> Shimmer the will make a Tutorial, on how to use the mouse in Win8, because its all programmed to use Touch...
<dr-whooves> *nice
<d3rb> windows 8 can go to hell from what ive seen
<dr-whooves> I like it :c
<d3rb> i want my pc to be a pc, not a tablet
<OtakuTom> Yea, I'm gonna avoid Windows 8, except to know enough to troubleshoot it when I get support calls at work.
<Lil_B> d3rb integrated flash... bye security
<dr-whooves> IT WORKS ON PCS GOD DAMMIOT
<d3rb> it ok i got norton :P
<RoboGerbil> lol theres nothing new in win 8, just a new gui
<dr-whooves> ^
<Shimmer> W8 is a smartphone OS for a pc... that can fuck off until they have perfected the technology on crappy phones
<RoboGerbil> err not new ghui, modified
<dr-whooves> Its really just a cosmetic thing yeah
<dr-whooves> but i liek it
<RoboGerbil> cuz win vista and 7 have the 'widgets'
<OtakuTom> I tried it and really didn't like it.
<d3rb> i use the widgets :(
<d3rb> the shame!
<dr-whooves> :D
<Shimmer> W7 > xp > 98 > w8 > vista
<dr-whooves> 98 shoudl be at the end
<Lil_B> nope, ME
<dr-whooves> xp shoudl be numbah 1
<d3rb> ah hem....windows me?
<RoboGerbil> win 95 > vista
<dr-whooves> XP> all
<dr-whooves> \
<OtakuTom> That GUI is not designed for multiple monitors (at least when I used it) and really was a pain to work with.
<d3rb> xp>7>98>95>
<RoboGerbil> objection; win xp does not have direct x 11
<dr-whooves> The best part, Win 95 > Mac OSX
<d3rb> objection, windows xp was fucking awesome
<OtakuTom> Yea, I'd argue that W7 is slightly better than XP.
<d3rb> xps time has passed but for its time it was just...wow, leaps and bounds from 98
<dr-whooves> WHy are we talking about this, i came in late
<dr-whooves> also, song link pl0x
<RoboGerbil> cuz somepony was having boot errors
<d3rb> ins Monfangs fault, he started talking about his laptop lol
<dr-whooves> OH laptops suck
<d3rb> :D
<Monfang> Everything can eventually be lead to being my fault.
<RoboGerbil> i dunno why anyone would even bother with a laptop anymore
<dr-whooves> Know that feel bro

*d3rb shuffles
<OtakuTom> I get to try and fix my gaming desktop tomorrow. It freezes unexpectedly when doing any sort of video and even some games. I've tried different video cards and video drivers, done multiple memory tests, and I can't find anything at all that seems to be causing the problem. I'm able to use a different mobo/processor/RAM setup and have no problems whatsoever.
<|Discord|> hai everypony!
<dr-whooves> Everypony hates pyros
<dr-whooves> Hay discord
<RoboGerbil> I own a gaming pc, a smartphone and a tablet... sold my laptop a year ago
<d3rb> hey |Discord|
<Om-oldbean> Sylandest: Oholaoa I havent sleepd yet!
<Lil_B> hi |Discord|
<CountDoofus> hai |Discord|
<dr-whooves> Otakutom, Pirate windows, Old CD key, Backup your games and format
<OtakuTom> Hey |Discord|
<Sylandest> Om-oldbean: :O why have you not slept yet?
<Om-oldbean> Sylandest: I dunno, but its sunrise now
<OtakuTom> I have multiple legitimate Windows licenses...not the problem.
<Shimmer> RoboGerbil: Change the tablet with a BMW and you got me!
*|Discord| hugs dr-whooves d3rb Lil_B CountDoofus and OtakuTom at the same time
<Sylandest> Om-oldbean: have you been hitting the coffee and/or caffeine?
*Lil_B hugs |Discord| back
<OtakuTom> The problem is the new mobo/processor
<d3rb> |Discord|: your arms are HUGE
<dr-whooves> oh
<Om-oldbean> Sylandest: None at all.
<|Discord|> d3rb: You have no idea
<dr-whooves> Eyup, you're fucked
<RoboGerbil> OtakuTom: wait what? you upgraded your cpu and now your video crashes randomly?
<CountDoofus> Any SAI users that can provide some assistance?
<d3rb> :D they must be 3 metres each to hug so many at once
<Sylandest> Om-oldbean: hmm...then I have no idea, outside of you choosing to be awake from sheer force of will, lol
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma stop soon
<Wrek> 05noo Phase4!
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, you want to take over stream?
<dr-whooves> YES
<OtakuTom> The entire computer crashes, specifically when watching videos and sometimes while gaming.
<Phase4> 00,02last round for me
<Om-oldbean> Sylandest: Its not that hard, just wooooooords
<dr-whooves> Otakutom, WTF happened?
<Sylandest> Om-oldbean: the power of words? :D
<OtakuTom> But it doesn't give any errors. The entire system locks up, and the only thing I can do when that happens is force a hard boot.
<RoboGerbil> OtakuTom: get a resource monitor, watch your ram fill. you might have a damaged chip. if it freezes every time you hit a certain point youll know
<Om-oldbean> Sylandest: I got tired of that sentence.
<Memme> Great, now I want to go play TF2.
<dr-whooves> WTF, what the freindship
<Sylandest> Om-oldbean: hehehe :D
<Memme> What's the song?
<Lil_B> I often get Bluescreens, and i even have found out what caused them... when my Internet connection is really low, my Wlan Driver freaks out... but I can't delete or replace it (there is no update) and if i delete it, i can't use the Internet anymore :/
<dr-whooves> Holy shit, Same computer since 2006, still kicking ass
<Memme> Ouch.
<Memme> dr-whooves: Hello!
<CountDoofus> Waitasec. 2470 HP?
<OtakuTom> Do you mean damaged memory, RoboGerbil? I've run multiple memory tests and it can't find any problems.
<dr-whooves> maybe its because im on it ALL the time
<RoboGerbil> Lil_B: what kind of router and what kind of wireless reciever?
<RoboGerbil> OtakuTom: yeh its either damaged memory or a screwed up overclock
<OtakuTom> It's not even overclocked >_>
<dr-whooves> You're fucked man, CPU's aren't cheap
<OtakuTom> This is just running it stock. I haven't had a chance to even overclock it.
<dr-whooves> Whats your MOBO
<dr-whooves> AMD or intel?
<RoboGerbil> lol so ignorant, all pc's overclock now. if you have multiple cpu's on 1 chip youre overclocking weather you know or not
<dr-whooves> ^
<dr-whooves> This
<Lil_B> RoboGerbil Hama WLAN-Stick 54 MB/s, router, I don't know, its my neighbors (he knows about it, I pay for using his router, its still cheaper than buying my own Internert)
<|Discord|> I just have multiple computers
<dr-whooves> Every fuckign PC i own, Salvaged parts
<dr-whooves> all of em
<d3rb> good bits?
<dr-whooves> meh,
<d3rb> good enough?
<dr-whooves> My favorite has 3 hard drives though
<dr-whooves> XD
<OtakuTom> Yea, I know, dr-whooves. This is all brand new hardware. It's an ASUS P9X79 using the Intel LGA 2011 socket processor.
<d3rb> lol
<RoboGerbil> Lil_B: hmm.. not sure about that. think thats the one you lease through your internet company, and those are always crap.
<|Discord|> I will spend 5,000 dollars for this Alienware!*1 year later*awww ot broke time to get a new one?
<dr-whooves> *yay* AMD cpus are WAAAAAAAAAY cheaper
<dr-whooves> Im gonna leave soon
<CountDoofus> Any SAI users that can offer some assistance?
<Lil_B> RoboGerbil My connection is reall Strange: router ->repeater(in my house)->WLAN-Stick->8 meters of USB-Cable->my PC
<RoboGerbil> lol discord, alienware is dell, its chinese garbage. its just the XPS with a case mod
<dr-whooves> ^this
<dr-whooves> Build your won, cheaper and So much more fun
<d3rb> ^
<|Discord|> RoboGerbil: The 5,000 dollar ones suck ass
<OtakuTom> I've used AMD cpu's before and wasn't really that fond of them.
<RoboGerbil> you can get a barebones off newegg.com for under $400
<dr-whooves> Really? meh, to each his own
<d3rb> i love my amd phenom 2
<dr-whooves> Dont go barebones,
<dr-whooves> Then you're restricted to their Mobo standards
<RoboGerbil> barebones lets you upgrade to your favorite parts
<dr-whooves> 60-80$ case leaves you 300 for a mobo of your choice
<dr-whooves> cheaper ;D
<RoboGerbil> and barebones usually gives a discount on ram/MB/CPU combo
<dr-whooves> Good point,
<RoboGerbil> also you know they will work and fit together without research
<dr-whooves> I was gonna build a PC but poorfag haz no job :(
<Chrysalis> thanks for the games guys
<d3rb> but dr-whooves a good case should get a minimum of 5 years out of it
<dr-whooves> So salvaged parts it is ;D
<Om-oldbean> poof stream gon!
<Lil_B> My new PC will be entirely new, but from then on I will just upgrate it from time to time and will use my old PC to learn how to build a PC on your own :)
<dr-whooves> Any case can do that long if you taker care of it
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, streams free
<RoboGerbil> Lil_B: word of advice, if you build a gaming pc, dont skimp on the case to save a few bucks
<d3rb> i guess it depends on how big the graphics cards and such you plan to use will be
<dr-whooves> same factory default cas for 6 years running, several Hard drive, Ram and Graphics cards updates
<dr-whooves> But all entry level crap
<dr-whooves> :(
<Lil_B> RoboGerbil I will probably get 3 120fans to get proper cooling
<Lil_B> RoboGerbil it WILL be a gaming PC
<dr-whooves> My first graphics card came out of a 9win 98 PC XD
<d3rb> entry to mid level any case will last forever but high end is where you should consider a bigger better case
<dr-whooves> ^this
<RoboGerbil> I usually look for the air intake vent right by the video card in the side
<dr-whooves> Me, MOAR HARD DRIVE SLOTS
<RoboGerbil> lol dr-whooves just get a full tower
<d3rb> use all the drive bays!
<RoboGerbil> server case
<RoboGerbil> 4' tall
<dr-whooves> I dont have room or money for that
<d3rb> ...nah, just make those internals hdd;s external
<Lil_B> I may come back someone when i finally decide it
<dr-whooves> Nope, internal, keep it purty
<RoboGerbil> eeew external HDD's are usually crappy usb tho... so slow
<dr-whooves> ^thisd
<Lil_B> does some here has a Rasberry Pi?
<d3rb> ....weld two cases together, one with mobo cpu etc, the other hard drives....full of hard drvies :S
<dr-whooves> ^
<dr-whooves> Methinks me needs a job :c
<OtakuTom> Yea...the reviews on Newegg for my mobo are not that good >_>
<RoboGerbil> lol why bother weld? just drill screw holes in the MB side and mount the drives right to the side
<dr-whooves> Otakutom, you have a compusa near you?
<d3rb> i need a second job for all my hobies :D
<d3rb> maybe even a third
<dr-whooves> i need a first :(
<d3rb> theyre over ratted and life sapping
<dr-whooves> ALL teh fluttershys :( :( :( :(
<d3rb> rated*
<OtakuTom> Maybe I'll try finding a better mobo...I only got this one 'cause it was able to use PCI-E 16x/16x for SLI.
<RoboGerbil> i see no difference in 8x vs 16x
<dr-whooves> Any CompUSA's near you?
<dr-whooves> They have great prices,
<OtakuTom> There might be, but there's also a Micro Center and a Fry's.
<dr-whooves> O.o i take it those are small buisnises
<dr-whooves> *Buisnesses
<Malavolent> Ello there.
<Om-oldbean> I'ma try and take a nap. Hopefully I won't miss the whole day.
<dr-whooves> Hay Malavolent
<d3rb> hey Malavolent
<Sylandest> howdy, Malavolent
<dr-whooves> Bai oldbean
<Sylandest> you heading off, Om-oldbean?
<CountDoofus> hai Malavolent
<OtakuTom> Both are actually nationwide chains, but they're not everywhere.
<Lil_B> hi Malavolent :D
<RoboGerbil> meh, newegg sells parts for about a buck over wholesale, and they deliver right to your door
<Om-oldbean> Yeah, i'ma sleep for a bit
<Om-oldbean> laters guys
<dr-whooves> Not in miami :/
<Sylandest> take care, Om-oldbean :)
<d3rb> take it easy Om-oldbean

<Jim> I like summer. It's my favourite day of the year.
<RoboGerbil> so what you think about all that voting stuff in florida?
<OtakuTom> I love my case. 5 fans, all 80mm or larger, and it still runs incredibly quiet.

<Jim> don't think so
<Vordox> Oh mai Wrek is playing Tf2 D:
<OtakuTom> More for the fact that I need light to make sure I don't kill myself while walking through my room XD
<dr-whooves> I wanna be able to chat from my bed :3

<Jim> Well, there are irc apps, so you could connect to the chat from that
<Soital> 12our examination consisted of them facing away from the door
<Soital> 12and staring at a wall
<dr-whooves> Apple device
<RoboGerbil> your fruit device is sub-par
<dr-whooves> it is :c
<RoboGerbil> shoulda gone android
<dr-whooves> I want an android
<RoboGerbil> free updates
<RoboGerbil> and free games
<RoboGerbil> and free hax
<dr-whooves> But this is an ipod, got it when my MP3 player broke
<d3rb> you just need an irc client and the know how on how to use it and BAMM, bronystate EVERYwhere..chat only
<OtakuTom> I need to get a new laptop, too...this one's about 4 years old now and is starting to show its age. I'm barely able to run Skyrim on the thing, and Diablo III is pretty much unplayable.
<dr-whooves> No crack for diablo 3

<d3rb> i gotta check that ouit
<RoboGerbil> but if you were smart youd sell all your loot in the gold auction then sell the gold for money
<Angel_Espeon> 13I wish ours were like that LOL
<d3rb> ah
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just did my best to avoid eye contact with anyone xD
<dr-whooves> That snaps it >:c
<OtakuTom> Yea, I'd rather sell my items for gold and sell the gold for money.
<Soital> 12at least it's all over now
<dr-whooves> Im putting androidn on myiDevice

<Lil_B> Michael me too, it looks (and sounds) georgius, and they are really fockust on balanced, yet unique characters
<LoyalDash> CCCP: Wow, hahahaha:D
<CCCP> :#
<OtakuTom> I'm hoping to make a couple MLP flash games if I can learn how to program in flash...lol
<CCCP> :3*
<Michael> sup Lil_B
<HiImSpike> rocketbrony4221: nice
<LoyalDash> Cone Head is offically best pony, thanks to CCCP for confirming such.
<OtakuTom> Just some quick easy puzzle games...like a Bejeweled clone using the elements of harmony or a Yoshi's Cookie clone using cutie marks.
<CCCP> LoyalDash: :D *feels proud*
<rocketbrony4221> sh*t kids say on MW3: most common phrase: GAY!!!
<Michael> poor twili
<rocketbrony4221> XD
<Ninjazz> For once, I agree with LoyalDash... the stars must have aligned for this one. p__p
<CCCP> rocketbrony4221: orly?
<FairysHuff> What to say when kids say GAY!! on a game. Say back "Yeh? And? Your point is?" ^_^
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: hehehe :D
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: that works some of the time, lol
<rocketbrony4221> yeah orly :3
<HiImSpike> FairysHuff: good point
*VioletVanilla giggles
<VioletVanilla> 06silly ponies~
<Michael> gay is not an insult :(
<Sylandest> VioletVanilla: its what we do best
*Ninjazz is silly? :S
<FairysHuff> Michael: Exactly
<HiImSpike> it means happy in my books
<LoyalDash> Ninjazz: They haven't, I'm just dat awesome.:3
<OtakuTom> I really don't play online...at least not with strangers.
<CCCP> i do
<FairysHuff> OtakuTom: I barely play online at all anymore. Just so many asshats online.
<rocketbrony4221> well gay is a completely overused word and one of the reason i wanna sell my MW3 is because people say it too much on there...yeesh
<CCCP> but i never talk to them
<Ninjazz> LoyalDash: Pfffft. :D
<LoyalDash> Ninjazz: You know that is true.:D
<Michael> i hate people who uses homofobic words to insult :[
<Michael> wat
<RaveBrony> o.o
<FairysHuff> I would like to find someone to play NWN1 for a bit.
<rocketbrony4221> *reason's
<Ninjazz> LoyalDash: Whatever. :3
<HiImSpike> Michael: true
<OtakuTom> Yea. It's tough even going into random battlegrounds on World of Warcraft. You make a single mistake and the rest of the team berates you for the rest of the match.
<CCCP> Michael: i dont hate people who do it, I just hate it when people DO IT
<CCCP> its mean
<CCCP> and pointless
<RaveBrony> I hate how its become so common in normal speak nowadays :\
<CCCP> ^
<Lil_B> best thing to say to homophibic persons "What? You never sucked a dick before? Are you gay?" it will so screw with their heads#
<HiImSpike> you know at the end of the day it is just a word nothing else
<Michael> sup
<RaveBrony> Something different than what im used too!?!? Obviously gay..... =_(\
<FairysHuff> Just remember that people who use GAY as an insult are just stupid. Ignore them and mute them in game.
<Sylandest> RaveBrony: but of course, lol. Because thats how everything seems to work these days :D
<rocketbrony4221> well said huff.well said. words to live by
<Lil_B> I can't buy the new Potato Sack on steam because i bought the old one already last year :/
<RaveBrony> Sylandest: Eeeyup, lol
<rocketbrony4221> BRB
<Michael> FairysHuff: exactly
<Ninjazz> Let's not discuss this topic...
<RaveBrony> Im glad my friend came out of the closet, or i wouldve NEVER been this way.... I was THE most Homophobic person you would EVER meet!! :D
<Michael> FairysHuff: this is how to kill these hates
<HiImSpike> yeah im with Ninjazz
<OtakuTom> I already have the games from the potato sack that I want.
<FairysHuff> I remember I joined a PUBLIC LFD2 game once. I was in there for like 30 seconds and got kicked out for no reason. I no longer play online ^_^
<Michael> i'm starting to wub this serv
<rocketbrony4221> back :$
