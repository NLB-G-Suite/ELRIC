<soulrider95> Why all the ea hate? EA isnt THAT bad!
<Acid-Ace> Once and awhile
<TheHoodyNinja> 3d is a stupid gimmic and everyone knows it
<WindWhistler> Acid-Ace: This was in 2008.
<WindWhistler> The 3DS isn't too good...there's a lack of good games....
<Acid-Ace> Ea has too many sports games
<MahBoi777> that went better than expected
<sagas> WindWhistler: do you remeber when it was at E3? It changed so much for the worse
<MahBoi777> nevermind
<Acid-Ace> WindWhistler: Kid Icarus uprising
<WindWhistler> Acid-Ace: Like I said, a lack of good games. That's only one.
<WindWhistler> I'm waiting for Animal Crossing.

<FairysHuff> TheHoodyNinja: This is one of the many reasons I hate her character
<Dark_Horst> was that a g11=
<WindWhistler> Anyone read Cheeky Angel?
<Dark_Horst> ?
<TheHoodyNinja> FairysHuff: I dont watch this anime :/
<Acid-Ace> I want that paper mario sequel
<Pinkie_Kittie> Hai MahBoi777
<Acid-Ace> I love paper mario so much...
<alexxm> whats it about WindWhistler
<FairysHuff> WindWhistler: I've watched the anime
<MahBoi777> Acid-Ace: me too!
<Vordox> DEM MUSIC
<WindWhistler> alexxm: It's about a boy was tricked by a genie. He wished to be the manliest man, but instead became the womanliest woman.
<Acid-Ace> Isnt Nintendo debating wether to remake A link to the past or Majora;s Mask?
<TheHoodyNinja> dat non lipsynch
<FairysHuff> alexxm: It's actually really good
<MahBoi777> Acid-Ace: I think so
<Acid-Ace> ALTTP would be interesting to see in 3d
*sagas cant stand having to read sub-titles to understand whats going on, but will stay around for Sumica's OC dancing
<CountDoofus> 3 of them and they can't hit shit? Tsss.
<WindWhistler> Sumica's OC is rocking out to non-existant music.
<Midnight_Splendor> Stormtropper training.
<Everlasting_Joy> CountDoofus: They took lessons at the Stormtrooper academy.
<HML> hey viri
<MahBoi777> sagas: u actually get used to it
<Acid-Ace> Why do Storm troopers have such poor aim?
<WindWhistler> Does it still ping if you use a name but add 's?
<Vordox> BAD ARSE SCENE INCC
<RyunosukeKnT> that buffer
<Dark_Horst> she'S not very smart, is she?
<Viri> hi
<Everlasting_Joy> Acid-Ace: The magic of plot convenience.
<alexxm> ok WindWhistler and Fairyshuff
<Sumica> 00,10dont be doubting ma skillz
<Viri> on mobile -w-
<TheHoodyNinja> oh shit he made it open
<HML> How's you?
<CountDoofus> Because they're all clones of a bad shooter?
<sagas> NOT A SPECIALIST!
<HML> Aww
<TheHoodyNinja> he so good
<FairysHuff> sagas: I prefer subs, you get to enjoy the original voices over the very poor english dubs
<Acid-Ace> Do storm troopers even use the same kind of clone as the clone troopers did?
<Acid-Ace> or are they degraded?
<WindWhistler> FairysHuff: Though sometimes the voices are even more annoying...
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Ran10) 11WB10»11•. 10- Skyrim is part of a nutritional balanced breakfast
<sagas> FairysHuff: I feel english dubs can be done right, just they prequently arent
<WindWhistler> Especially for lolis
<Sumica> 00,10Acid-Ace, copys of copys
<FairysHuff> WindWhistler: I've never encountered that
<Acid-Ace> So its not the same skill
<GilDash> Acid-Ace: They began to use more then one template, stopped using the original Jango Fett copy, and began recruiting other humans in too.
<Acid-Ace> Well thats acceptable for an answer
<WindWhistler> FairysHuff: You haven't? They always have these annoying high-pitched squeaky voices...
<MaidSurge> METAL GEARS :D
<Everlasting_Joy> How appropriate they're guns are in the shape of an AK-47.
<Dark_Horst> those are some huge-ass smgs
<sagas> Always with the mechs
<FairysHuff> WindWhistler: I don't have a problem with them.
<Vordox> REVELATIONS
<diddutz> Sumica: you should have an animation dusting something, it would suit your outfit :3
<FairysHuff> WindWhistler: In fact I like it
<Acid-Ace> Why are animes so much better in the jap dub?
<MahBoi777> METAL GEEEEAR
<alexxm> who actually makes the giant ass guns the mechs use
<WindWhistler> Acid-Ace: Because the Japanese are gods at making anime and manga
<FairysHuff> Acid-Ace: Cause english dubs are very poor
<WindWhistler> There's no such thing as a bad anime or manga.
<Acid-Ace> I doubt there is a GOOD american dub
<Dark_Horst> alexxm: giabt-ass weapon manufacturers
<Midnight_Splendor> Because lots of the context and emotion of the anime is lost when a english dib is created.
<Dumori> WindWhistler you sure?
<Midnight_Splendor> dub*
<Icy|Soarin_I> TOP PONIES NEVER EVER GIVE UP :3 Hello Everypony !!!! ^.^
<sagas> Whoops I twitched and clenched my fist
<Viri-Mobile> so how are you hml?
<Viri-Mobile> i can still talk
<Acid-Ace> You know whats a really poor edit in One peice?
<WindWhistler> Dumori: Or so I thought. But apparently there's plenty of bad anime according to Bennet the Sage.
<pony98679> hello?
<FairysHuff> Yes, the characters in animes are bound to their voices. They lose a lot of that in english dubs.
<MahBoi777> robot>armored vehicles
<sagas> These bullets are the size of artillary shells and very expensive, yet they shoot them like nothing
<Dumori> WindWhistler there is mostly as there a FUCKTONN
<Acid-Ace> I forget her name.... but one of the characters was gone for a long time, supposedly in the jap dub she either died or was in prision..
<RustyMeat> Cant wacth away from Sumica dancing
<HML> I'm okayish
<Dumori> so much manga exists
<Acid-Ace> The american dub REMOVED that importance COMPLETLY
<Acid-Ace> The fuck 4 kids!
<HML> no laptop until monday
<Dumori> x3
<sagas> Now flying mechs? How impracticle
<Ponies47> HEY EVERYPONY! :)

<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Ponies47.
<GilDash> Ponies47: Holla! :)
<MahBoi777> hey Ponies47!
<WindWhistler> I don't get why 4kids keeps dubbing violent anime...
<alexxm> hey Ponies47 hows your day been
<Dumori> there are English dubs that are on par/better than the japanese+subs
<Acid-Ace> Why the shit would you remove the reason a character went missing!
<WindWhistler> I mean, One Piece, seriously?
<sagas> WindWhistler: why not
<WindWhistler> Though they don't own it anymore
<FairysHuff> This is why you either BUY the anime DVDs or watch online folks. Never watch anime on terrestrial tv
<sagas> Dumori: agreed
<WindWhistler> sagas: They keep censoring all the blood and stuff
<Vordox> FACEPLANT
<MahBoi777> WindWhistler: yup, their one piece dub is terrible
<Ponies47> Hi Everlasting_Joy GilDash MahBoi777 alexxm fine thank you :P
<Acid-Ace> WindWhistler: not to mention they took out the death of a main character
<Bronysith> HIYA EVERYPONY
<Dark_Horst> that'S what you get for standing still in a sniper scope
<sagas> WindWhistler: Let the kids enjoy a good show. Blood and stuff isnt always necessary
<MahBoi777> WindWhistler: not to mention that ghastly opening rap -_-
<sagas> What a bad shot
<Om> Look at dat swager
<alexxm> hey Bronysith hows your day been
<Dark_Horst> of COURSE the giant mech has hair
<WindWhistler> Though I like Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's opening...it's really good.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Bronysith.
<Ponies47> Hey Bronysith :)
<Acid-Ace> You know its bad when they drop a character for no reason when its been edited out
<GilDash> Dark_Horst: I was just about to say something. :D
<Bronysith> Ty Everlasting_Joy Ponies47 and alexxm
<Acid-Ace> Does anyone know the name of that blue haired chick from one peice?
<Ponies47> Bronysith: No prob :P
<sagas> WindWhistler: NO! ANYTHING PAST THE ORIGINAL SERIES/CHARACTERS
<sagas> WindWhistler: CAN NOT EXIST!
<WindWhistler> sagas: Then G4 shouldn't exist either.
<Acid-Ace> I forget the girl's name... she was a main character and had blue hair
<WindWhistler> Besides, I'm just talking about the OPENING.
<Acid-Ace> This is gonna bother me now...
<sagas> WindWhistler: G4 is not shit. The Yu-Gi-Ohs after the original characters are shit
<Viri-Mobile> aww
<Vordox> KUUUUUURZZZA WWWWWWWEBEEEER!
<TheHoodyNinja> Acid-Ace: Vivian?

<Sumica> 00,10what's recoil?
<sagas> WindWhistler: They bastardized the series
<Acid-Ace> I think so hoody
<sagas> Acid-Ace: too gimmicky
<WindWhistler> sagas: Dude. I'm just talking about the OPENING!!
<Sylandest1> Sumica: i have no idea what you're talking about :3 :D
<Acid-Ace> Guess what happened to Vivian?
<sagas> WindWhistler: eh it was alright
<Acid-Ace> Know how she just vanished?
<GilDash> Sumica: Something Newton invented? :S
<WindWhistler> sagas: You're getting too worked up.
<MahBoi777> guns.....how do they work?
<TheHoodyNinja> Acid-Ace: i like one piece but i dont keep up with it
<Acid-Ace> In the jap dub she died
<WindWhistler> MahBoi777: Well, you pull a trigger....
<FairysHuff> For those of you who want One Piece subbed: http://www1.watchop.com/
<Acid-Ace> So yea... 4kids dropped that completly
<sagas> WindWhistler: Yu Gi Oh was my childhood
<Biglaw> Sumica recoil is whenever you shoot a gun, and it sort of pushes itself back, due to it propelling a bullet at a high speed
<MahBoi777> WindWhistler: does the bullet come out the small end?
<Acid-Ace> Can you see why I hate 4kids?
<Sumica> 00,10chain saw sword
<Acid-Ace> A main character dies and they completly remove the character from exsistence
<alexxm> that kid is way to happy about being in a war zome
<TheHoodyNinja> MahBoi777: theres a little fairy inside each gun chamber that makes bullets fly at over 800ft per second and kill people
<WindWhistler> And they still stayed near the windows
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: Oh heck yes!
<FairysHuff> alexxm: He grew up in a war zone
<MahBoi777> TheHoodyNinja: ohhh, that makes sense, thanks
<Viri-Mobile> meh, skype is stupid
<TheHoodyNinja> MahBoi777: thats how cod explained it
<Viri-Mobile> it deleted all my contacts
<Acid-Ace> Was the Yugioh show made first then the cards? I guess its obvious...
<Viri-Mobile> andoid app
<FairysHuff> Their called murder fairies
<FairysHuff> I have 12
<Viri-Mobile> o.o
<Bronysith> Acid-Ace: the yugioh manga is actually fantastic . read it sometime
*Acid-Ace pulls out an empty bottle
<alexxm> Acid-Ace the manga came first
<WindWhistler> Acid-Ace: The original Yu-Gi-Oh manga didn't even involve cards. They didn't appear until the second volume, and then they disappeared for a while.
*Biglaw is happy because he got a game on itunes
<Biglaw> :D
<Ponies47> Biglaw: Yay :)
<WindWhistler> Though for some reason, the mangas for the other Yu-Gi-Oh shows came AFTER the animes...
<Sylandest1> Biglaw: congratz!
<MahBoi777> TheHoodyNinja: Lol
<Acid-Ace> What the hell did the manga even have for a plot?
<TheHoodyNinja> i just noticed a big chocolate stain on my shirt

<CountDoofus> Dark_Horst: Eh. I'm a big wuss. Didn't even manage to sit thought The Blair Witch Project. And don't get me started on Paranormal Activity.
<MahBoi777> DaringDude: I haven't, but I wondered if they were any good
<Acid-Ace> This is interesting
<Acid-Ace> According to Lauren, she initially wanted Tara Strong to voice Pinkie Pie, and Tara wanted to voice her with a Bubbles-esque voice.
<TheHoodyNinja> We should watch Hostile at some point
<Acid-Ace> So Tara was supposed to be Pinkie Pie...
<Sumica> 00,10doubt that will ever happen TheHoodyNinja
<DaringDude> theyre quite fun that was my childhood gaming right there destroy all humans and battlefront 2
<flutterchu> i bet he hacked.... what

<TheHoodyNinja> HI cyc I CANT STOP YELLING
<Acid-Ace> You know that part with the squierl in Hurrican flutter shy?

<CountDoofus> omnipony: Yep, Juliet Starling. Or as I like to call it: humanized, potty-mouthed Twilight.
<cyc> THEN I SHALL YELL WITH YOU
<CountDoofus> With a chainsaw.
<CCCP> whats this??? :3
<Acid-Ace> Twilight says do I look like I speak squierl? Funnily enough her VA does
<Obsidian> Hey there everypony
<CCCP> hi Obsidian :D
<Acid-Ace> I found it amusing when I found out Tara voiced Bubbles
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Obsidian.
<flutterchu> *sigh* i loved the n64 days
<TheHoodyNinja> Acid-Ace: Why?
<WindWhistler> OMG N64 was the BEST
<TheHoodyNinja> ^
<WindWhistler> Had some of the best platformers
<flutterchu> just keep spinning
<Acid-Ace> There was a line where Twilight said do I look like i speak Squierrel?
*TheHoodyNinja throws up rainbows on flutterchu
<Acid-Ace> She doesnt, her voice actor did as bubbles though
<CountDoofus> Dark_Horst: I'd rather not, not looking forward to changing my underwear fifteen times in one hour.
<omnipony> CountDoofus: Yeah its a really big change from a childrens show to a dirty short skirt cheerleader killing zombies!
<Dark_Horst> Acid-Ace: there was
<WindWhistler> WHYYYYYYYYY
<flutterchu> :(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:(

<CCCP> SuperBrony64: :D!!! yay
<TheHoodyNinja> omnipony: Tara voiced that princess from drawn together
*CCCP glomps SuperBrony64
<Acid-Ace> Can someone remind me who Namby Pamby is?
<Sumica> 00,10yay
<flutterchu> TheHoodyNinja what was that for
<Acid-Ace> I forget who the pony was
<Panda> LETS DO THIS!
<TheHoodyNinja> cyc: WHY ARE YOU NOT YELLING
<omnipony> really? I need to watch that then lol
<Acid-Ace> Featherweight was originally called Milquetoast and he was Namby-Pamby's little brother.
<Sylandest1> Acid-Ace: Applejack
<Everlasting_Joy> Acid-Ace: The editor in chief, noted in S2E23.
<CountDoofus> TheHoodyNinja: Princess Clara. Also Toot Braunstein in the same show.
<Sylandest1> Acid-Ace: mistel, never mind, lol
<TheHoodyNinja> flutterchu: too much spinning
<HML> hrm
<flutterchu> :P
<MahBoi777> GO GO GO
<CCCP> What if there was like a bucket full of melted cheese and i ate it?
<Sylandest1> MahBoi777: AJ does it better :D
<TheHoodyNinja> wow you beat up a punching bag
<Acid-Ace> In Lauren's original pitch for the show, Pinkie Pie was a Pegasus and Fluttershy was an Earth Pony. The entire cast went through a design change, from G1 Ponies to G3 Ponies (though some of them are In Name Only).
<DaringDude> i think i might get lolipop chainsaw looks hilarious
<cyc> what is this???
<MahBoi777> Sylandest1: O U:D
<omnipony> lol this is an intense game
<Everlasting_Joy> CCCP: The constipation levels would be off the scale.
<Sylandest1> MahBoi777: XD
<TheHoodyNinja> your so tough
<CCCP> Everlasting_Joy: lol :D
<Acid-Ace> So wait Tara is the main character in lolipop chainsaw?
<flutterchu> *nods to the rythem*
<DaringDude> lol
<Panda> Acid-Ace: and also harley quinn :D
<omnipony> Acid-Ace: Yeah
<Acid-Ace> That explains the artwork of Twilight with a chaincaw and outfit
<MahBoi777> haha
<Acid-Ace> I wondered what caused that
<TheHoodyNinja> all perfect?
<omnipony> Now the dirty twilight videos are going to skyrocket since they can use the voice in the game
<Acid-Ace> Several characters had name changes for legal reasons. Twilight Sparkle was Twilight Twinkle (a G3 pony), Princess Luna was Princess Selena, Apple Bloom was Appleseed, Big Macintosh was Big Apple, and Gilda was Grizelda.
<DaringDude> oh this
<killerpony7733> This yay
<Acid-Ace> I have to ask about the name changes
<Everlasting_Joy> I love this one, especially the "King" one.
<CCCP> oh gawd this
<CountDoofus> Also Timmy Turner, Poof, Raven, Bubbles, Batgirl in Batman: TAS, and what not.
<Acid-Ace> Who the hell owned the rights to the origonal names?
<DaringDude> wubbadubbadubba dat true?~
<Everlasting_Joy> *"King" parody.

<TheHoodyNinja> why is he sweating that much?
<cyc> SuperBrony64: just got the refrence xD
<Vordox> Panda: Check his score... :P
<MahBoi777> wubadubadub is that true?
<TheHoodyNinja> the audience is getting soaked

<Everlasting_Joy> This looks more accurate to a real wrestler interview.
<DaringDude> lol
<Sylandest1> wat
<Vordox> Panda: TADAAA
<Panda> XD
<Acid-Ace> "Read It and Weep" was apparently "Reading Rainbow". Legal issues with the TV show prevented this, though The Merch did get to use it.
<Panda> WHAT!

<Vordox> SuperBrony64: <3

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> flutterchu: economy problems
<WindWhistler> flutterchu: There is no main villain.
<alexxm> sorry to hear about that otakon
<otakon> so, just popping in to say hi and have some background noise really
<MahBoi777> the villain is u for throwing plants
<flutterchu> that makes sense
<Acid-Ace> God I dislike Celestia alot some times
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: IKR
<Obsidian> otakon: Good luck it can be rough out there
<WindWhistler> This game is basically a bug world.
<WindWhistler> All the enemies are bugs
<MahBoi777> giant bugs
<otakon> Obsidian: eeyup
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol that boss
<WindWhistler> so I'd say you're about the size of an ant
<omnipony> nintendo never ceases to amaze me
<MegaMoonShine> Nooooooo"
<omnipony> or confuse me
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SuperBrony64: so did you get the game when it first came out?
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: Do you have the first Pikmin?
<Acid-Ace> I love the whole company pretty much fails because Loui ruined the job
<WallDives> Hello.
<WallDives> Pikmin on stream?
<WindWhistler> Acid-Ace: SPOILER ALERT
<Obsidian> The developers basically say the Pikmen are ants
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ya
<MegaMoonShine> Hello WallDives
<otakon> dat face
<Barbetos|AtWork> Seems legit
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace you just kinda threw a spoiler there
<Acid-Ace> The game has been out for years and I didnt say how he ruined the job
<Acid-Ace> I just said he failed the job
<Acid-Ace> Never said HOW
<TheHoodyNinja> Just a quick question, who else is getting Borderlands 2?
<alexxm> otakon why don't you try giving your CV to every shop in town
<Vordox> Acid YOu just did...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: ya
<WallDives> TheHoodyNinja, I probably will, on X360.
<WindWhistler> Acid-Ace: It doesn't matter how, you just said he was responsible. That is a spoiler
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: the game is rare dude not a lot of ppl know what it is
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yesh and WindWhistler: Yesh :3
<otakon> Acid-Ace: his cargo got eaten by a ravenous giant space rabbit
<MahBoi777> TheHoodyNinja: I never played the first one, is it good?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SuperBrony64: Respect <3
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: So why aren't you playing the first one?
<TheHoodyNinja> MahBoi777: 8.7 in my rating
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This is the enhanced version with Wii Remote controls
<MahBoi777> ah
<WindWhistler> I absolutely HATE how Pikmin 3 is coming out for Wii-U.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WindWhistler: Cause this one is cooler :3
<Barbetos|AtWork> Pikman2 the journey to africa!!
<Acid-Ace> Didnt this take awhile to actually get to america?
<otakon> alexxm: CV? I'm not familiar with that term. anyway, been filling out applications for all the places in town and asking around
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WindWhistler: No way, I love that it's coming out on it :D
<omnipony> im still singing that sea ponies thing xD
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: That is true...but you should still start with the first game.
<CriticKitten> WindWhistler: Why? It looks GORGEOUS in HD
<flutterchu> if there that small than in super smash brothers. :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> WindWhistler: theres nothing wrong with it coming out just for wii u
<Obsidian> SuperBrony64: Me too
<MegaMoonShine> Nice landing
<alexxm> CV is a resume stuff like qualification info
<Everlasting_Joy> WindWhistler: There wasn't much carry over from 1 to 2.
<Acid-Ace> I want Dark Pit to be in Smash 4
<alexxm> otakon a CV is a resume stuff like qualification info
<MahBoi777> wonder how much the Wii-U will cost..
<WallDives> Considering that Pikmin is a nintendo franchise, iirc, what ELSE would it be on, the 3DS?
<flutterchu> mario link and other people are also small then
<WindWhistler> Well for one, my mom won't let me get any more systems. And it was planned to come out years ago.
<Acid-Ace> MahBoi777: I heard suggestiong around300 I THINK
<Barbetos|AtWork> He is flouting protocol obviously.
<Acid-Ace> Dont quote me on that
<Barbetos|AtWork> Who ever heard of an dangerous uncharted planet?
<WindWhistler> Hopefully this turns out better than the Duke Nukem game did.
<otakon> alexxm: oh, well the problem is I have no real training. I've got experience in the customer service industry however
<Acid-Ace> Does anyone else want Dark pit for smash 4?
<MahBoi777> Acid-Ace: sounds about right tho
<TheHoodyNinja> When does the next SSB come out?
<WallDives> TheHoodyNinja, hasnt been announced.
<WindWhistler> TheHoodyNinja: Probably with the release of Wii-U.
<alexxm> otakon stuff like GCSE's and A levels would go on it
<WallDives> WindWhistler, doubtful.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TheHoodyNinja: it probably might be somewhere after the first year of Wii U
<MegaMoonShine> TheHoodyNinja: Around the same time as episode 3 :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> WindWhistler !!! Duke Nukem was amazing!.... If it came out 10 years ago like it is now! =o
<WallDives> We would have heard about it.
<Acid-Ace> But Sakurai said as soon as Kid icarus was done they would begin on it
<ACS13123> STEEEEEEEEEEVE!
<ACS13123> ITS STEVE!
<TheHoodyNinja> I hope you can still use the gamecube controller
<otakon> alexxm: the hell is a GCSE? A levels?
<TheHoodyNinja> otherwise im screwed
<WindWhistler> Barbetos|AtWork: Are you kidding? People say the game was HORRIBLE.
<ACS13123> SO MUCH STEVE!!!!!!! DJFDSIOFJ DKSJVSKJFHCDKSH M
<MahBoi777> STEVE
<WallDives> Also, Pokemon Conquest is mad fun.
<Acid-Ace> OH Chugga
<CriticKitten> Ded
<Acid-Ace> He forever regrets that meme
<WallDives> TheHoodyNinja, you could use the WiiU pro controller.
<WindWhistler> MIYAMOTO!!!
<TheHoodyNinja> this chair in uncomfortable
<alexxm> otakon stuff you get for doing exams at least in england
<TheHoodyNinja> is*
<Acid-Ace> So whats so special about the pro controller?
<WallDives> Acid-Ace, nothing, except it looks like a X360 controlelr.
<TheHoodyNinja> Acid-Ace: its pro?
<WallDives> controller^
<Acid-Ace> That sound un impressive
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's lighter than the GamePad Acid-Ace and maintains the look and feel of a traditional gamepad.
<CountDoofus> The best part of E3 this year: http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/120605.jpg
<Barbetos|AtWork> WindWhistler Oh it was good, it just sucked really bad for console players as the port was not optimized at all. The other problem was that it pretty much copied a bunch of other FPS games that had already came out. Like I said if it came out like 10 years ago like it is now, then it would of been way better.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> WallDives: all controllers look the same man
<flutterchu> they announced a game caled super msash bros "Universe" for 3ds and wii u
<Obsidian> Acid-Ace: Its meant to show Nintendo can compeat with the other big consoles
<WallDives> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, not really, imo.
<Barbetos|AtWork> 3d realms should of just released several games instead of one pile of fail.
<Acid-Ace> I dont see with the game pad issue yet
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> anyone happy that Luigi's Mansion 2 is coming out for wii u?
<Acid-Ace> Negative much?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Also TEXT WALL
<WindWhistler> I hope you can plug headphones in the Wii-U thing...
<CCCP> dat text wall
<Acid-Ace> Wait its on the wii U also?
<Acid-Ace> Fuck the 3ds version then
<TheHoodyNinja> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I AM NOW THAT YOU TELL ME THIS!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: they announced it at E3 2012
<otakon> alexxm: you don't get those here in the US.
<WindWhistler> Because if someone is watching TV and you want to play a game, how can you even hear what's going on?
<Acid-Ace> I want that new paper mario game
<flutterchu> yep
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WindWhistler: Yeah, you can :) Check Nintendo's E3 site for more info about the controller
<alexxm> ah right sorry otakon just trying to help
<TheHoodyNinja> Im only getting Bo2 for the zombies
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: What's the point? My mom isn't gonna let me get it anyways...and I'd been waiting for years for Pikmin 3...*sighs*
<Acid-Ace> And it pisses me off people are allready bitching about Sticker Star's mechanics
<TheHoodyNinja> hopefully they dont ruin it
<WindWhistler> Oh lord, this part is HILARIOUS
<CCCP> TheHoodyNinja: i think everyone is
<otakon> alexxm: that's okay, thanks
<Om> Goodbye yalls!
<alexxm> bye Om
<CCCP> bye Om :3
<Obsidian> Bye Om
<otakon> bye Om
<TheHoodyNinja> bye Om have a nice day
<Obsidian> dat face
<Everlasting_Joy> Later Om.
<Acid-Ace> It isnt even OUT YET, You dont have the right to bitch about something UNLESS YOU HAVE EITHER PLAYED IT OR SEEN IT WELL ENOUGH
<GilDash> Om: See ya. ;)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Later Om!
<MegaMoonShine> Bye Om
<WindWhistler> This next part is hilarious
<Acid-Ace> Sorry...had a bit of a nerd rage there
<Sylandest1> laters, Om!
<flutterchu> did you know that this game has the same moveset as mario in this cancelled mario game for the gamecube called super mario 128
<alexxm> odd how olimers report inculdes game controls
<CCCP> Acid-Ace: i agree!!!! /)
<Barbetos|AtWork> That pikman is not staring at him, oh no, it is ploting his demise!
<Acid-Ace> Hi steve
<MahBoi777> bye Om!
<Panda> Om: aww :( byes :D
<alexxm> Acid-Ace this is why i always have a wait and see policy
<WindWhistler> Louie is drooling.
<Sylandest1> :D
<Acid-Ace> I only bitch about stuff I played
<Obsidian> Louie want to eat him
<Everlasting_Joy> Louie is hungry.
<CCCP> which is better Pikmin 1 or 2?
<Everlasting_Joy> 2
<Acid-Ace> Unless you play it your self you cant have the right to whine about it
<WindWhistler> CCCP: Pikmin 2.
<Obsidian> CCCP: 2
<MahBoi777> feed Louie
<CCCP> okay :D
<WindWhistler> Aw man, the stream skipped the funny part! :'(
<Acid-Ace> I hate what one guy i met on the Hellfire coms stream told me
<flutterchu> i need pikmen 1 to get all the trophies in super smash bros melee
<Acid-Ace> I said I liked Other M and he said unless I hate it I'm not a true metroid fan
<WindWhistler> flutterchu: It's Pikmin, not Pikmen
<Acid-Ace> The fuck...
<CCCP> flutterchu: really?!! nuuu! that means i do too :(
<MahBoi777> wut6_9
<TheHoodyNinja> breeding...
<cyc> still buffering
<Acid-Ace> Just because I like ONE GAME other people hate, that doesnt make me not a true fan
<MegaMoonShine> Acid-Ace: Sooooo, you have to be a fan of it by hating it?
<WindWhistler> Does this count as asexual reproduction?
<flutterchu> yeah i know its pikman but pikmen is what my passwrd is for alot of stuff so pikmen for me
<Acid-Ace> MegaMoonShine: He apperently said so
<Everlasting_Joy> I've always love that in video games. "Repeatedly tapping A, as reported in Olimar's report. . .
<CCCP> accidwhat game is that?
<Everlasting_Joy> Who would write that?
<MegaMoonShine> Acid-Ace: :|
<Acid-Ace> A metroid game people seem to hate
<Sylandest1> WindWhistler: ehh...kinda.
<alexxm> Acid-Ace this is why i don't really talk to the extremists of any fan base
<WindWhistler> flutterchu: Uhh...you shouldn't say your password to other people...
<Obsidian> Acid-Ace: The gameplay in Other M is alright, its just the story that people are pissed about
<MahBoi777> Everlasting_Joy: tap tap tap
<flutterchu> how do i reply
<Acid-Ace> You know whats funny?
<CCCP> I like Black Ops :P
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777: :).
<Acid-Ace> The x parasite clone stuff
<MahBoi777> xD
<WindWhistler> Well technically our fanbase acts the same way about G3 and G3.5... >_>
<alexxm> what Acid-Ace
<TheHoodyNinja> WindWhistler: my password is ****
<MegaMoonShine> :P
<Acid-Ace> so the ridly in Fusion is a clone of a clone of ridley
<flutterchu> and i did not tell you what progams i use that password for
<Acid-Ace> because said corpse of ridley in fusion was from the bottle ship
<flutterchu> and it ends with a number
<Acid-Ace> So its a zombie clone of a clone
<Kakumy> hey everypony!
<alexxm> WindWhistler to be fair it deserves it
<CCCP> hi Kakumy
<MegaMoonShine> hey Kakumy
<Obsidian> Hello Kakumy
<alexxm> hey Kakumy hows your day been
<Acid-Ace> And Neo ridley HURTS MY EARS
<flutterchu> what's up
<Kakumy> ya its cool im on holiday in paris...
<CCCP> Kakumy: awesome!
<Acid-Ace> Alot of people mock Samus's panic attack in other M
<Kakumy> who streaming?
<Kakumy> Wrek...
<Acid-Ace> I understand why she panics
<alexxm> whats it like Kakumy is it going well?
<WindWhistler> alexxm: No it doesn't. Those characters made the G4 characters.
<TheHoodyNinja> Kakumy: sb
<CCCP> G3 is best G
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: IKR
<Everlasting_Joy> I forgot how much product placement is in this game.
<Acid-Ace> Super metroid supposedly in the time line takes place After prime
<alexxm> WindWhistler i meant in terms of writing
<Kakumy> ya it's going well..
<Acid-Ace> and prime 2 and 3
<MegaMoonShine> Wtf
<Kakumy> ugh i keep buffering...
<Acid-Ace> And Ridley fucking blew up with the planet and she thought that was it so its fair she panics
<WindWhistler> alexxm: Now that I can understand. The characters are just victims of bad writing...they shouldn't be criticizing the actual characters...
<alexxm> so wait pikmin is set afteer the end on earth
<Acid-Ace> also can I say Ridley IS FUCKING BUFF in Other M?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i hated the way samus reacted to Ridley in Other M
<CriticKitten> Uh
<Sylandest1> ok, somepony tell me what the pikmin are saying
<alexxm> WindWhistler i never did critize the characters
<CriticKitten> Why is there a Duracell o.o
<flutterchu> nooo i wont get to see a pikachu!!!!!!!!!:'(
<Acid-Ace> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: To be fair that was supposed to be the final encounter and the planet blew up with him
<drf|away-HomePC> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<WindWhistler> alexxm: I meant "they" as in the fanbase
<Acid-Ace> Also the fact he murdered her parents doesnt help
<Sylandest1> CriticKitten: we be on earth, long after we've all gone poof
<flutterchu> how do i reply
<WindWhistler> That's why I personally believe that the G4 characters would NOT react in horror to their G3 counterparts.
<flutterchu> anyone
<MegaMoonShine> flutterchu: Type the start of the guys name and press tab
<MahBoi777> Sylandest1: they are saying bring me dinner damnit
<Kakumy> ughh I keep buffering too much... is it because I download too fast...
<Acid-Ace> After all the games I have played I have come to relise The Galactic Federation is FUCKING EVIL
<TheHoodyNinja> WindWhistler: wait what
<CriticKitten> Sylandest1: I knew there were on Earth, but if it's long after humans, shouldn't the battery be sort of more....decayed?
<alexxm> so wait pikmin is set after the end on earth
<Vordox> Speed Painting Sumica, for practic^^
<Vordox> http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/521/speedpaintsumica.png
<WindWhistler> TheHoodyNinja: If G3 and G4 met, the G4 ponies would not be horrified.
<WindWhistler> After all, the G3 ponies are just victims of bad writing.
<Acid-Ace> The Galactic Federation is either secretly evil in parts of it or morns
<TheHoodyNinja> WindWhistler: oh is that all?
<Vordox> And yes Speed painting is not focusing on details. :P
<flutterchu> alexxm: nooo i wont see a pikachu!!!!!!11:'(
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey SuperBrony64, if you use the D-pad to move the Pikmin, you don't have to throw them at the object if you're close.
<Acid-Ace> Troopers have taken bribes from space pirates...
<Sylandest1> MahBoi777: :D
<WindWhistler> TheHoodyNinja: Yeah.
<Acid-Ace> They tried to capture the X parasites and the SA-X
<Sylandest1> CriticKitten: some things would be, but in this case, its possible we're looking at a different flow of time here, so to speak
<Acid-Ace> They had secret metroid facilities....
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Everlasting_Joy: Thanks for the tip ^-^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: ya but other m is chronologically after Super Metroid so there have been couple of times where she sees him again

<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE
<Kakumy> Ok nvm..
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Then I'm out of ideas.
<Acid-Ace> How the fuck would you controll them?!
<MahBoi777> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: madness? THIS IS (insert region of desire here)
<Acid-Ace> If Mb was destroyed the metroids would go on a rampage
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: wahts ur steam id?

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Pikmin is best black sheep
<Ponies47> BRB
<WindWhistler> I like to call him Water Wuss though.
<TheHoodyNinja> have to have a 10 dollar pass to play their shitty multiplayer

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SuperBrony64: use that trigger finger to good use
<CriticKitten> Geez, those fatasses ate them all
<WindWhistler> If you notice, the PikPik carrots all look towards the enemy.
<Kakumy> Still giving carrots... eh..
<TheHoodyNinja> Kakumy: wich is why i like 2k and gearbox
<TheHoodyNinja> SO MENNY KAROOT
<alexxm> what do the carrots do
<MegaMoonShine> Why are there so many damn carrots!?
<WindWhistler> I still don't get how they're breadbugs.
<MahBoi777> mmmmm carrots.....ewwwww
<Very_Silly_Filly> They are all fat bastards now
<Acid-Ace> Super emptied Carrot Top's fridge
<Obsidian> dat science
<WindWhistler> Oh yeaaaaah, they're not real bulborbs
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: These guys don't do anything.
<Acid-Ace> Science : We throw stuff to the wall and see what sticks
<Kakumy> TheHoodyNinja: mine is Ubisoft, Naughty Dog and Rockstar Games
<MaidSurge> CARROT SPAM
<TheHoodyNinja> Kakumy: those are good ones, i dont know Naughty Dog tho :p
<MegaMoonShine> THROW THE CAAAAROOOOOOOOOOOOOTS!
<WindWhistler> TheHoodyNinja: Crash Bandicoot

<TheHoodyNinja> WindWhistler: ah
<Ponies47> BACK :p
<TheHoodyNinja> HI Ponies47 WHY ARE WE YELLING
<CriticKitten> Moar carrots needed
<Kakumy> TheHoodyNinja: Naughty Dog created Uncharted 1, 2, 3 and The Last of Us
<Ponies47> TheHoodyNinja: Was I yelling? I'm sorry :(
<TheHoodyNinja> Kakumy: I have never played any of those
<TheHoodyNinja> Ponies47: EVERYONE YELLING
<Kakumy> TheHoodyNinja: Their PS3 exclusives
<Obsidian> Im not yelling
<Acid-Ace> I love the Mario & Luigi Saga
<Ponies47> I'm not yelling :(
<Kakumy> TheHoodyNinja: The Last of Us was at E3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> .
<MegaMoonShine> brb
<TheHoodyNinja> Kakumy: I used to have a ps3
<Chrysalis> OMG IS THAT PIKMIN!
<MaidSurge> The Last of Us :3
<Kakumy> Ah...when in the chat we watch games it's very uncommon for people to talk about ponies.... if Season 3 Episode 1 omg ponies like crazy...
<Shamroc> ahh pikmin yay
<Chrysalis> <3 streamer
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Chrysalis: Pikmin 2!!!!
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: If you throw a Pikmin DIRECTLY on top of a Dwarf Bulborb, you'll kill it instantly.
<WindWhistler> Try the ship.
<flutterchu> ill be right back
<WindWhistler> Are you just spazzing out on purpose?
<Kakumy> afk...
<Obsidian> SuperBrony64: Waiting for them to grow?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MEGAMAN MEGAMAN, GETTING BIT BY A BULBORB REDUCES HEALTH ON YOUR HEALTH BAR
<Very_Silly_Filly> WindWhistler: Well, you don't get epeleptic seizures randomly do you
<Sylandest1> roflmao, SuperBrony64
*SuperBrony64 hugs WindWhistler
<RAWRity> Meh, this game is boring. Now, if it had some ROCK Pikmin...
<Very_Silly_Filly> RAWRity: Now all you need is a Wii U
<flutterchu> right here
<Wrek> 05SuperBrony64: sequelitis ftw
<WindWhistler> RAWRity: There are sumo Pikmin.
<MahBoi777> YAY Egoraptor
<WindWhistler> Wait, you forgot about the Pikmin in the ground
<Shamroc> WindWhistler......he knows what hes doing man..
<RAWRity> WindWhistler: who cares about that? Until they make some damn Rock Pikmin, this game will forever be worthless.
<Obsidian> WindWhistler: he's waiting for them to grow more
<WindWhistler> RAWRity: that would make the game broken, I think.
<CountDoofus> Ohai RAWRity
<RAWRity> Now if they WERE to put Rock pikmin in there
<RAWRity> then that'd be enormous news
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> woo tf2 update
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Waiting allows the Pikmin to grow into Flower Pikmin :)
<RAWRity> and would clearly merrit being the first thing they announce at E3
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: Oooh, that's what you were waiting for.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm sure Pikmin 3 has Rocks
<RAWRity> Because FUCKING ROCK PIKMIN
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: WELL THEN GOOD NEWS
<Shamroc> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: its nothing major...it was hecka fast for me to update
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: But be careful, if you wait TOO long, they'll go back to being leaves.
<Saturn> 08,01boingy
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: It still baffles me that THAT was what the led with at the conference.
<Obsidian> Ohi Saturn
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi saturn
<MegaMoonShine> Hi Saturn
<MahBoi777> hi Saturn
<alexxm> hey Saturn
<Shamroc> WindWhistler.........dude.......im PRETTY sure he know how to play and doesnt need you to backseat..
<alexxm> anyone play the overlord games
<GilDash> Saturn: Sproingy.
<WindWhistler> Shamroc: I'm just trying to be helpful...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Saturn: Stop being springy
<RAWRity> That's like if Microsoft had led off their conference by showing off "NBA Baller Beats", the Kinect Rythm game where you learn how to dribble a basketball while listening to LMFAO
<flutterchu> be right back agian if anyone cares
<Obsidian> Later flutterchu
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Not me. Nintendo fans, dude. It's one of their newest most successful franchises.
<alexxm> bye flutterchu
*Saturn 08,01bounces about
<Saturn> 08,01Very_Silly_Filly: nope
<Obsidian> SuperBrony64: You left one idle
*Very_Silly_Filly puts spiky pin under Balloom Saturn
<WindWhistler> Besides, he'll tell me if he doesn't want my help...
<flutterchu> im back
<Obsidian> that was quick
<Ponies47> Ohai Saturn :p
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: It's more akin to them leading with a Mario or Zelda or Metroid, Pikmin is slowly becoming a bigger thing than was expected, I think.
<WindWhistler> I think there are some eggs around here...
<Ponies47> Welcome back flutterchu :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Obsidian: He chooses not to follow the path of our species, therefore he chooses to die alone o___o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WindWhistler: I want your help silly ^-^
<MahBoi777> what a tragic life
<CriticKitten> It's not nearly at those levels yet, but it's starting to be a bigger thing.
<Very_Silly_Filly> SuperBrony64: Foreveralone pikmin
<Obsidian> SuperBrony64: :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SuperBrony64: Heretic Pikmin =/
<flutterchu> Ponies47: :|
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: Oh nooo!! :'( You're not actually gonna leave him behind, are you?!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: yes, but their FIRST announcment is "We got pikmin that look like rocks now" the same year they're releasing a new console? Priorities man.
<CCCP> Ugh
<CCCP> gtg
<WindWhistler> I hate watching them trip as they try to reach the ship in time....only to get eaten by the bugs...
<CCCP> Bye everypony <3
<Obsidian> Bye CCCP
<MegaMoonShine> Bai CCCP
<GilDash> CCCP: See ya! :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> They talked about the WiiU in 2011
<TheHoodyNinja> god damnit somebody sitting close to me just sat down to read
<Barbetos|AtWork> By CCCP
<Kakumy> im back..
<WindWhistler> RAWRity: You sure love rocks, don't you?
<Very_Silly_Filly> If you watched E3 11, they talked about the WiiU a bit
<Obsidian> SuperBrony64: btw there's a big flower near the red onion
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: They're launching the new console with only a 2D platformer of Mario, no Zelda, and no Metroid. Pikmin sort of BECOMES a priority when two of your big three are missing.
<Very_Silly_Filly> so would only make sense to open with a smaller franchise
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Obsidian: Thanks :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> CriticKitten: That's probably it
<Kakumy> Was planning to buy XBOX 360 but when I saw the XBOX 360 at E3 I was damn disgraced...
<Obsidian> No Problem
<WindWhistler> CriticKitten: Especially when many eager fans have been waiting for it for years.
<Very_Silly_Filly> They not release zelda or decent mario, so smaller franchises get a chance
<Very_Silly_Filly> Plus, better than 3DS's launch lot
<WindWhistler> Considering it was supposed to come out for the Wii, and then they changed their minds...
<Stallion_of_War> FOLLOW ME! I'LL LEAD THE WAY!
<WindWhistler> Check the map to find the lone Pikmin.
<Very_Silly_Filly> As good as the console is, even now, the game selection is one of the worst I've seen ever
<CriticKitten> They need something weighty to sell the new console with, and they only have Mario. Metroid isn't ready nor is Zelda. So what else? Pikmin, clearly. Notice they advertised it, as well as Wii Fit U (another big seller)?
<WindWhistler> Also, you might want to get moving...the day's almost over.
<CriticKitten> They're not entirely stupid. :P
<Kammerjunk> I've heard there was a secret chord that David played, and it pleased the Lord.
<Kammerjunk> But you don't really care for music, do ya?
<RAWRity> But as far as a a game I AM interested in: Persona 4 Arena looks like a lot o fun.
<MahBoi777> music hater!
<Kakumy> I felt like when I close my YouTube it made my video slower...
<Obsidian> SuperBrony64: Attack it from the rear
<Very_Silly_Filly> Well lets wait a few months
<WindWhistler> uh oh, I always hate encountering those bulborbs...I'm always afraid they'll eat my Pikmin.
<CriticKitten> Now I will say, it's sad they're not putting more behind the Wii U lineup. It's got SOME titles....but I think it a mistake to roll without a Metroid or Zelda out of the box.
<Very_Silly_Filly> You see they've mostly been pissing around with the technology
<Stallion_of_War> poor mushroom slug :'(
<CriticKitten> And my desire for more Zelda has nothing to do with my opinion on this subject.
<CriticKitten> :|
<WindWhistler> Oh look, another treasure.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: You know you need to get your mind out of the gutter when you accidentally read that "It's got SOME titties..."
<Very_Silly_Filly> We need a second 3DS zelda first :)
*WindWhistler is getting nervous.
<Michael> hai everypony
<Kammerjunk> Hai.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: odds are, theyre pushing the system out as soon as they can, so they have some time before they're competing with the PS4 and 720
<MegaMoonShine> hai Michael
<CriticKitten> Pikmin: A game in which your enemies' dead corpses serve as income
<Obsidian> Hello Michael
<Acid-Ace> Wasnt there a picture of a zelda game on the WiiU
<CriticKitten> FOR KIDS
<Acid-Ace> I could have sworn i saw one
<Very_Silly_Filly> Acid-Ace: No, it was a techdemo
<Ponies47> Hey Michael :)
*Michael hugs Kammerjunk Obsidian MegaMoonShine
<Daring_Do> who's streaming?
<WindWhistler> Uh oh...day is almost over...
<Very_Silly_Filly> MM hasn't been confirmed either
<MahBoi777> Daring_Do: SB
*Michael hugs Ponies47
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Hey, everypony-
<CriticKitten> Acid-Ace: There's a demo mockup of what Zelda might look like on the Wii U, from E3 2011.
<MegaMoonShine> Hey, Red_Pegasus|Soviet
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> By celestia
<Kammerjunk> Salve, Red_Pegasus|Soviet.
<MahBoi777> hey Red_Pegasus|Soviet and Michael!
<Obsidian> Not enough time to get the treasure :(
<WindWhistler> Oh crap, forgot about that wall.
<WindWhistler> You should leave one of the captains with the Pikmin so--oh you got it.
<WindWhistler> Check the map to find the lost Pikmin.
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> What Pikmin is this?
<Obsidian> Red_Pegasus|Soviet: 2
<Michael> hai MahBoi777
<CriticKitten> But that was only a demo mockup. There's no announced Zelda title for the Wii U. Honestly I'm surprised they didn't do what they did with Twilight Princess, and just port that to the Wii U with some added features.
<MegaMoonShine> Yay! we found him!
<Michael> Red_Pegasus|Soviet hai
<Acid-Ace> So that zelda picture was a cop out?
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Come to think of it, a Zelda game would have been great to showcase the Wii U controller, since the first thing I thought about for the interface was that it would be great for an RPG
<Kammerjunk> I want to see an FPS for the Wii U.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Acid-Ace: It was a techdemo
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> You know you can make the japanese commercal song appear
<Michael> pikmin 2?
<WindWhistler> Also, as long as either one of the captains have Pikmin, they won't be lost.
<Michael> :D
<Michael> i love pikmin
<Obsidian> lol
<Daring_Do> there IS a zelda wiiu game
<Acid-Ace> A good idea for the zelda wiiU could be have the inventory screen on the controller
<CriticKitten> Acid-Ace: No, not a copout. A demo. E3 2011 was mostly trying to showcase what the Wii U was capable of. So it had a lot of tech demos. This year's E3 showcased some actual games.
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: You don't have time to get the treasure now.
<Obsidian> Hurry
*WindWhistler is starting to panic.
<alexxm> Kammerjunk i think zombieu is a FPS
*Bronysith slaps WindWhistler
<CriticKitten> I maintain that they should port Skyward Sword to the Wii U and add features, like they did to TP before it. >_>
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Michael> panic, why?
<Acid-Ace> I found this odd scan in Metroid Prime 3
<Very_Silly_Filly> Zombi U looks meh tbh
<Daring_Do> there is a zelda wii u game
<Michael> :O
<Acid-Ace> It said Project Dread is now comencing...what the hell is Dread?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Majoras mask hasn't been confirmed yet
<Daring_Do> yes itt has
<Stallion_of_War> dat dari-bot
<Very_Silly_Filly> As far as I'm aware anyway
<RAWRity> Inb4 they just port Ocarina onto the U
<WindWhistler> Wait, what about the one at the can?
<Acid-Ace> Theres still debated wether it should be remade or A link to the past should be remade
<MegaMoonShine> Aaaaaaah! We're out of time!
<CriticKitten> Have the player use a Wiimote Plus for the sword, or use the tablet to do quick inventory swap.
<Kammerjunk> Am I the only one thinks Leonard Cohen looks kind of like Magneto?
<WindWhistler> oh no....
<Obsidian> You left one behind
<Kakumy> now my my video buffers alot..
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: make a wrist-strap peripheral for the tablet, and have them use it as their shield.
<WindWhistler> Nooo!
<Kammerjunk> And by that, I mean Ian McKellen.
<MegaMoonShine> Never forget.
<WindWhistler> Poor little guy...
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I'd go for that.
<WindWhistler> At least the enemies won't be there tomorrow.
<CriticKitten> That'd be sweet, actually.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> mips is sucking today =/
<Very_Silly_Filly> I think there was 5 fatalities
<Obsidian> 11
<Very_Silly_Filly> 11 :/
<Acid-Ace> What the hell is Project Dread anyway?
<CriticKitten> Strap to the front of your wrist, motion controls of the tablet dictate shield movement and the screen can act as a quick inventory swap.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: it was suppost to be a rumored game but it wasnt
<CriticKitten> That'd be....pretty engaging honestly. >_>
<RAWRity> Also, when they showed the Batman Arkham City thing with the remote control batterang, I was just wondering how long it'll take for some kid to hurl the tablet into their TV trying to throw it.
<Acid-Ace> Then why did they throw it in Prime 3?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uh-oh FFVII on steam .... Want..
<Very_Silly_Filly> RAWRity: Straps
<Michael> :O FFVII?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: it was probably just some loer stuff
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I've always been curious how many Wiimotes have been thrown into televisions
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: lore*
<Very_Silly_Filly> Final Fantasy 7
<CriticKitten> No one has that statistic sadly ;_;
<Acid-Ace> You want to know something disturbing?
<Shamroc> oh hai dead chat
<Kakumy> CriticKitten: alot....
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: a lot, considering they started releasing heavy-duty wrist straps for them.
<Acid-Ace> The space pirates tried to copy Samus' suit tech
<MegaMoonShine> CriticKitten: I remember seeing a video of that happening
<flutterchu> Acid-Ace: i think he typoed it by project dream is what he's trying to say project dream is the beta version of banjokazooie are you familliar with that game
<Acid-Ace> The morph ball results...are not pretty
<RAWRity> and how you Wii tells you for EVERY GAME to strap the thing on.
<Very_Silly_Filly> CriticKitten: You have to be pretty careless, I've been pretty sweaty sometimes without a strap and it#s never left my hand
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: You shouldn't send so many Pikmin to get the pellets. You need to get that treasure.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: IKR
<Very_Silly_Filly> Unless I put it down
<Acid-Ace> Science team has vapor for brains
<Very_Silly_Filly> Banjokazooie is the only decent mario clone
<WindWhistler> Why don't you send those Pikmin to the treasure and let Louie bring the other ones?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I know it was made roughly by the same people
<Michael> afk?
<drf|away-HomePC> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Very_Silly_Filly> But different universe
<Obsidian> SB be trollin
<Acid-Ace> Way to not pause the game SB
<WindWhistler> Very_Silly_Filly: BK was made by Rare
<CountDoofus> AFC. Away From Controller.
<WindWhistler> AFS. Away from stream
<Acid-Ace> Fungi forrest was origonaly going to be in Banjo Kazooie
<Acid-Ace> Guess where it ended up
<MaidSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: same people who made the Donkey Kong Countey games
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: But yeah. I like the wrist strap idea. Could also be cool for Metroid.
<flutterchu> Very_Silly_Filly: to my brains banjo kazooie is not a mario clone
<WindWhistler> ....I thought my idea was a good one...
<Acid-Ace> They decided to place it in DK64
<CriticKitten> Wiimote in one hand as a gun, the tablet strapped to other arm as a wrist communicator thingie
*WindWhistler sulks
<Kakumy> I'm watching football also...
<Acid-Ace> CriticKitten: dont forget inventory
<Very_Silly_Filly> There is a few things that make it unique
<Acid-Ace> They need to fucking bring back the add and remove suit funtions
<WindWhistler> ...
<RAWRity> Dude, I'd love the idea of playing a pokemon game on the Wii U.
<Kakumy> 0 Czech - Portugal 0
<Ponies47> BRB
<Very_Silly_Filly> In zelda, they should use the wii pad as a shield
<WindWhistler> I think you can pluck them now.
<Acid-Ace> I miss the add and remove suit functions from super metroid
<CriticKitten> That seems like it'd be pretty kickass for both Metroid and Zelda. ....goddamnit, why is Wii U releasing without a Metroid or Zelda?!?
<LightningDashFast> yo!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Strap it on like a shield
<Obsidian> Even the pikmen are annoyed by SB
<WindWhistler> Oh wait, did some just die out?
<Very_Silly_Filly> And you can still use as a item menu
<Obsidian> Hello LightningDashFast
<Acid-Ace> Or use it as a invetory screeb
<Acid-Ace> *screen
<Chrysalis> CriticKitten cause the WiiU is an abomination that nintendo deserve to suffer heavily for
<Michael> hai LightningDashFast
<RAWRity> When it comes time to catch a pokemon, you use the tablet to choose a pokeball, and then use the wiimote to throw it.
<Acid-Ace> Chrysalis: IT ISNT EVEN OUT YET
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Chrysalis: O_O
<flutterchu> because that's the first game my brother and i have ever played
<RAWRity> Added feature: you have to aim it at the pokemon to catch it.
*WindWhistler is concerned.
<Acid-Ace> No one has the right to bitch about ANYTHING untill you try it your self!
<WindWhistler> RAWRity: That would be annoying.
<Chrysalis> i saw enough at e3 and the pre-release information to know i hate it
<Very_Silly_Filly> My first game was Super Mario World on the SNES
<LightningDashFast> so is this pikmin or pikmin 2?
<Chrysalis> a) screen is poor
<Obsidian> 2
<MahBoi777> WindWhistler: why?
<Chrysalis> b) motion controls are too innacurate
<Ponies47> Back :)
<LightningDashFast> oh i c
<Kakumy> waht out?
<RAWRity> It'd make the Safarai zone a lot more worth while.
<Acid-Ace> I love how people bitch about stuff that ISNT EVEN OUT YET
<Chrysalis> c) cant actually handle 2 screens, though it was initially announced with 4
<WindWhistler> MahBoi777: Because he isn't pausing and the Pikmin are going to go back to being leavse.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Chrysalis: According to them, they have improved Wiiplus LOADS
<WindWhistler> leaves*
<Chrysalis> it fakes 2 screens by dropping the framerate
<WindWhistler> Wait, what about the treasure?
<Michael> :O
<LightningDashFast> i just got myself a wii
<WindWhistler> !!!
<Sylandest1> ..........
<WindWhistler> GO BACK
<MahBoi777> WindWhistler: oh
<Sylandest1> SuperBrony64
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have a Wii
<Michael> ded
<Obsidian> SB you Troll
<WindWhistler> .......................................................................
<Very_Silly_Filly> Bought a black one for 60 quid with Motion pluss
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Where'd they go? D:
<Kakumy> Microsoft added mroe shit to their console...
<Chrysalis> Very_Silly_Filly not really, they still have a MASSIVE issue in that they can't actually detect up and down properly

<Sylandest1> SuperBrony64: they drowned! you drowned them!
<WindWhistler> SB: Red Pikmin can't swim.
<LightningDashFast> ded
<WindWhistler> They all died.
<Chrysalis> they actually aim for a "lack of left and right" rather than a "go up and down"
<Obsidian> SuperBrony64: Pikimen 101 Reds dont swim
<Bronysith> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5xqyoTb651r3xauuo1_1280.png dat molestia
<WindWhistler> You might want to reset.
<Chrysalis> which is why every game you can just couch and waggle it
<Kakumy> Wait... who streaming im still confused...

*Kakumy farted
<Kakumy> :P
<Chrysalis> CriticKitten not to devs
<Barbetos|AtWork> LightningDashFast I has! I gots it for my DS.
<Bronysith> LightningDashFast: of course
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 5Abomasnow.
<CriticKitten> One of the major complaints of last year's E3 was that it would only feature 1 screen.
<Chrysalis> it was supposed to be 4 screens
<pony_3419> HAHAHAHAHAHA
<Barbetos|AtWork> MURDER!!
<Michael> and ded again
<Obsidian> Damnit SB
<Bronysith> LightningDashFast: i played it on the SNES and i am going as crono for dragoncon

<TheMonstaMuffin> Hello everypony! Long time no see!! Speak*
<Michael> how dare you!!!! :[
<LightningDashFast> EVILLLLLL
<Acid-Ace> I hate people bitch about stuff they never played
<otakon> hiy TheMonstaMuffin
<Michael> hai TheMonstaMuffin
<alexxm> hey TheMonstaMuffin hows your day been
<Obsidian> Game over?
<CriticKitten> Because they're usually inaccurate. >_>
<Ponies47> Hey TheMonstaMuffin :)
<MahBoi777> hi TheMonstaMuffin
<Kakumy> hey TheMonstaMuffin!
<Sylandest1> howdy, TheMonstaMuffin
<otakon> I think so Obsidian
<Acid-Ace> Sonic 06 the main exception
<Acid-Ace> Sonic 06 can be bitched about regardless
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hiya, best community ever! :3
<Very_Silly_Filly> My Skyward sword expereience was pretty good
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: When you Pikmin are drowning, you call them from dry ground, they'll head in that direction and get back to land.
<TheHoodyNinja> bored now, later guys
<CriticKitten> E3 exists so we can get correct information, most of the "leaks" during the regular year tend to be wrong
<MahBoi777> Blonic
<Bronysith> ALL GREEN EYED SONIC GAMES SUCK
<Very_Silly_Filly> Never really had a problem with pointing up and down
<Kakumy> bye TheHoodyNinja!
<WindWhistler> You probably shouldn't save...
<MahBoi777> later TheHoodyNinja! take care
<LightningDashFast> how about legend of the dragoons?
<Acid-Ace> Oh fuck the sonic fanboys
<alexxm> bye TheHoodyNinja
<LightningDashFast> for ps
*Bronysith glomps LightningDashFast "OF COURSE"
<Michael> bye TheHoodyNinja
<Acid-Ace> Sonic has the most broken fanbase EVER
<Bronysith> Acid-Ace: i know right
<WindWhistler> Wait, you could've started from last save...
<TheMonstaMuffin> And aleexm. Its been fine. U?
<Kakumy> i dont like the nintendo characters...
<Obsidian> ! free pikman
<Michael> and then start again, better load game
<WindWhistler> ...I should probably just let you do your thing...
<CriticKitten> Besides, the Wii U is fine. And I can't speak for your experience with Wiimote Plus, but I've never had any issues using it.
<LightningDashFast> it took me a while to beat it
<Acid-Ace> Should I feel bad for ratting out my sister?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Pikman is rarity
*WindWhistler sulks
<Barbetos|AtWork> THROW IT IN THE LAKE!
<|Discord|> Acid-Ace: NOT AT ALL
<Obsidian> Lets see ho long before he kills it
<flutterchu> Kakumy: NO ONE DARES MAKE FUN OF MY FLUTTERCHU
<Acid-Ace> She was looking up female porn
<Michael> nooooooooo
<Acid-Ace> So yea.... and she's 12
<Michael> don't kill it!
<|Discord|> Acid-Ace: Is she lesbo?
<Kakumy> O_O flutterchu?
<WindWhistler> ...............................................................
<TheMonstaMuffin> I know i've been inactive latley.. :/
<MahBoi777> kill it!
<Acid-Ace> YOU MONSTER
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This game is too hard :/

<TheMonstaMuffin> But no worries! I will be on more from now on!!
<LightningDashFast> murderer:[
<Obsidian> 40 seconds a new record!
<Michael> :(
<WindWhistler> .............
<Acid-Ace> Is superbrony sadistic?
<CriticKitten> It's been plenty accurate enough to play Skyward Sword and actually feel like I'm wielding a sword. If you wanna be the dork on the couch waggling the remote instead of the cool kitten (like me) who swings that thing like it's real and beams friends in the face with it, then you can do that.
<Kakumy> flutterchu: except for Pokemon I like Pokemon
<MahBoi777> SuperBrony64: u need a shotgun
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: You can't put red Pikmin in water.
<flutterchu> Kakumy: dont touch me:[
<otakon> Acid-Ace: he likes outright failing games at times for no paricular reason
<WindWhistler> You need to get blue Pikmin...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WindWhistler: D: Why didn't you say so sooner??
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: I said so multiple times.
<LightningDashFast> lol
<CriticKitten> SB is best troll
*Kakumy throws pokeball at flutterchu
<Obsidian> WindWhistler: SB is trollin you
<Kakumy> RAGEQUIT!!!
<LightningDashFast> SB is evil tyrant
<otakon> SuperBrony64: how about some King of the Hill man?
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi SuperBrony64. I see its 'Pikmin' thats on the menu :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02TheMonstaMuffin: Indeed :3
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: Maybe I should PM you instead, so that way my comments won't be pushed up by everyone else.
<Obsidian> TheMonstaMuffin: That game is too hard for him
<Acid-Ace> So should i feel ANY guilt that I ratted out my sister?
<flutterchu> Kakumy: flutterchu blengs to me
<LightningDashFast> howz about some chrono trigger?
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://sharkrobot.com/images/large/shirt_vgcats_pikaflash_LRG.jpg

<Kakumy> I'm 14... is it possible that im the youngest here?
<Biglaw> I'm not a huge fan of CoD, I know how to play it and all, it's just I don't want to go deaf from screaming twelve year olds :p
<Acid-Ace> I should be more trust worthy then my 12 year old sister who apperently looked up lesbian porn
<LightningDashFast> WAT
<Obsidian> Kakumy: Very likely
<flutterchu> Kakumy: im 12

<LightningDashFast> :D
<Obsidian> wow
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Acid-Ace: Good Snitch
<CountDoofus> Biglaw: My solution to that is plugging in the headset, and then just not put it on your head. :)
<Acid-Ace> And yet she lies so much they dont belive me when i have nothing to do with when things happen
<Kakumy> Biglaw: thats the most annoyign part about COD...
<Biglaw> CountDoofus I do not have xbox live, so I do not have to worry
<Acid-Ace> She's also carved holes in the walls
<Bronysith> Biglaw: CoD is horrible
<Acid-Ace> and painted her furniture
<Bronysith> Kakumy: the most annoying part of CoD is that it is the same game every year
<LightningDashFast> shes not pinkamena is she?
<LightningDashFast> lol
<Kakumy> Bronysith: I'm just getting Black Ops 2 to make pony emblems :P
<Biglaw> I do not have CoD, the only experience I have playing it is at a friends place
<Biglaw> Kakumy :D
<CountDoofus> Very_Silly_Filly: Just checked the Walking Dead game. No episode 2 on my end.
<flutterchu> Bronysith: 3 year old would say what the *f-word* yeah he would just cus alot
<Bronysith> Kakumy: why would you waste 60 dollars on that

<Wrek> 05appreciatign the graphics =/= demanding them

<CountDoofus> Bronysith: I wouldn't say the worst game, but definitely not deserving of GOTY. At all.

<leaderoftheclub> its 330pm
<drf|laptop> 03I don't wanna use spoilers but aftier the end credits of the last episode basically
<omnipony> lol saturn with a pink beard

<Bronysith> HIOYA everypony
<sagas> ScootaChicken: We would never do such a thing and we agree with you
<ScootaChicken> Both his guitar work and his singing are pretty mediocre.
<Yahooz> ohdearwut?
<sagas> beyond logic? :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ScootaChicken: O_o
<ScootaChicken> Although maybe his guitar work is mainly the shitty tuning/effects to blame.
<sagas> Saturn's headset = pinkie pie
<FairysHuff> I returneth everypony. Got my arse kicked at X-Com ^_^ What happening here?
<ScootaChicken> Although that's probably still his fault.
<twilight_sprinkle> ScootaChicken: well i think hes decent for a random fan, they apparently didnt practice much before this,i actually expected him to be worse
<sagas> We still hear Saturn fine
<Marcy> Gotta go

<twilight_sprinkle> ScootaChicken: he needs to work on the note transition imo, other than thats hes ok i think
<Yahooz> ello Saturn
<ScootaChicken> And also twilight_sprinkle, AFAIK he's hardly a 'random fan', he's a member of Everfree Radio

<Reikim> I stopped reading manga a while ago. The last manga I actually read through was Chrono Crusade.
<RAWRity> and personally, I think Mangahere's way of doing things is better.
<Videofreak1127[M]> How do I get to the server?
<superretroworld> shoot him
<RAWRity> They'll post the new chapter as soon as a scanlator has it done, then replace it with a better one when it becomes available.

<RAWRity> And it looks like "Magico" is getting cancelled. Yes. Good.
<RAWRity> RaveGraduate: no problem. I'm glad I found it too.
<otakon> APS|Evil: refresh mate, they switched services

<Randomnerd> Jarate!
<otakon> yeah, LimeV is a bit more stable
<Ponies47> APS|Evil: IDK :p
*APS|Evil pours soda on Ponies47
<RAWRity> otakon: Magico's a really crappy manga that started in Shonen Jump last year. I've been rooting for it to fail for a while, and it's spent the last 10 weeks at the bottom of popularity polls, so it seems to be ending next week.
<Randomnerd> So! Awesome!
<Ponies47> *Is covered with soda* (gasp) MY MANE! :o
<superretroworld> just saw a pinkie [ie poster, did gabe program that himself?

<CoalDust> i love this video
<Randomnerd> Iron sights?
<CoalDust> the shere awesomeness
<sagas> superretroworld: So you have 2 brothers each guarding a door. One will always tell the truth and one will always tell a lie. You have to go through the door guarded by the one telling the truth. You only get one question and it must be yes or no. What do you ask?
<Evil_Spike> Ooh, TF2
<Randomnerd> sagas: I've got a letter for god.
<Meanwhile> Quick, shoot things.
<sagas> Randomnerd: Okay?
<Evil_Spike> Why didn't you grab out your SMG?
<Randomnerd> sagas: It's a Ricky Gervais Show thing.
<sagas> Randomnerd: Never heard that one before
<superretroworld> sagas: idk
<Wrek> 05i dont use the SMG
<sagas> superretroworld: Well if you pick the wrong door, you die

<sagas> CriticKitten: There are a few ways to solve it
<otakon> Bronysith: lol
<superretroworld> sagas: and you said you can only go through the door with the guard telling the truth
<Randomnerd> sagas: It's funny, it's Stephen Merchant, Ricky Gervais and Karl Pilkington
<Evil_Spike> Oh, I also need to check my mailbox to see if my collectors box of MLP has arrived
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Because Nocturne is lurking.
<Derpy_Hooves> http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/21299

<superretroworld> who*
<sagas> superretroworld: You pick which to ask
<leaderoftheclub> .
<sagas> superretroworld: Want to know how I would do it?
<leaderoftheclub> ..
<superretroworld> sagas: do you tell the truth?
<sagas> superretroworld: The liar would say yes and the truthful one would too
<Meanwhile> Barn door plank.
<RAWRity> Dat Face: ding a door. One will always tell the truth and one will always tell a lie. You have to go through the door guarded by the one telling the truth. You only get one question and it must be yes or no. What do you ask?
<RAWRity> whoops
<Bluestrom_S> thanks Wrek
<superretroworld> sagas: i give up, whats your solution?
<RAWRity> Dat face: http://c.mhcdn.net/store/manga/8945/031.0/compressed/k012.jpg
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: What colour is the sky?
<sagas> superretroworld: Ask one of them "does 2 + 2 = 4?"
<otakon> Meanwhile: it has to be a yes or no question
<Meanwhile> Spoilsport.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Is the sky blue?
<MahBoi777> dat face indeed xD
<otakon> sagas: okay, then ONE would say yes(and thus could be lying) and the other would say no(thus HE could be lying)
<superretroworld> sagas: why?
<otakon> sagas: so you still haven't elimanated the liar
<sagas> otakon: The liar would say no. Truthful would say yes
<otakon> sagas: but the liar would say yes as well
<MahBoi777> so the lesson is to trust noone?
<sagas> otakon: No that would be telling the truth
<RAWRity> otakon: no, the liar would say 2+2 isn't 4
<RAWRity> because that would be a lie.
<sagas> ^
<otakon> IF I SAY YES, I COULD BE LYING
<otakon> IF I SAY NO, I COULD BE LYING
<sagas> No, I know 2 + 2 = 4
<MahBoi777> 6_9
<Meanwhile> otakon: Is the sky blue?
<RAWRity> otakon: no, if you say yes, you said something that is true
*otakon facepalms
<otakon> Meanwhile: no
<MahBoi777> trust yourself lol
<sagas> One ALWAYS lies and one ALWAYS tells the truth
<Devonx25> I want ponies!. :[.
<otakon> sagas: yes
<Meanwhile> otakon: Not taking your door then.
<MahBoi777> sagas: what if they both lie?
<sagas> MahBoi777: then they are breaking the rules
<otakon> Devonx25: YOU NEVER ASK FOR PONIES! NEVER NEVER NOT FOREVER GODDAMMIT!
<Meanwhile> MahBoi777: We wouldn't know that.
<Devonx25> Y!?
<Devonx25> .
<MahBoi777> nope
<sagas> MahBoi777: yep
<Meanwhile> Devonx25: Because you'll get G3.
<Devonx25> Y!?.
<Devonx25> G3!? FUCK NO!?
<MahBoi777> sagas: oh I know they'd be breaking the rules, I agree, but we wudn't know it
<otakon> Door A says Yes. If he's telling the truth, then he would still say yes. HOWEVER, the liar would tell the OPPOSITE answer i.e. No.
<sagas> Now we're gonna get G3.5!
<Meanwhile> otakon: So why can't I ask if the sky is blue?
<sagas> MahBoi777: Then the scenario is pointless
<otakon> Meanwhile: bc it's not actually blue
<Devonx25> I GET G3, I GET PISSED!.
<Reikim> I am BEST MEDIC
<Devonx25> I GET G3, I GET PISSED!.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Fine. Is grass green?
<otakon> Devonx25: then you'll get kicked
<MahBoi777> sagas: ow mah head
<Devonx25> I WANT G4 PONIES!.
<otakon> Meanwhile: not always, once again you need a concrete answer
<sagas> MahBoi777: Breaking the rules of the test would render the test pointless
<DocSane> Okay, this will be my first time playing TF2...
<RAWRity> Devonx25: well then go to youtube
<Devonx25> NOT G3!.
<MahBoi777> sagas: so u shud trust noone right?
<Reikim> DocSane: Play medic. Easiest class to play.
<sagas> MahBoi777: One doors suppose to lead to heaven and one hell
<Ponies47> Devonx25: We get it :|
<otakon> Devonx25: dude, they will BAN you for making a ruckus about it. we show ponies tomorrow
<Ponies47> Devonx25: We get it :|
<sagas> MahBoi777: then youre just fucked
<Meanwhile> otakon: Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh. Is a circle round?
<Devonx25> how about Dan Vs?.
<MahBoi777> sagas: well ya got a 50/50 chance, that's better than nuthin
<CriticKitten> There are so many ways to break that riddle.
<otakon> Devonx25: just calm down, we don't show ponies all the time. it's usually streamers choice and demands are usually not met
<Devonx25> i can watch this. i just sayin.
<CriticKitten> World's Biggest Tea Party please. :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> what was the chat room for technical problems ?
<sagas> MahBoi777: Then its just a guessing game and the brothers might as well not be there at all and just 2 doors
<Ponies47> Devonx25: Then sit down and watch.
<Devonx25> wtf is dat blue thing!?.
<RAWRity> Here's an easier one: You're on a path when you get to a fork in the road. One way leads to a village of people who only tell the truth. The other leads to a village of people who tell only lies. At the fork, you meet somebody who is from one of the 2 villages. How do you get him to lead you to the village of Truth speakers?
<Randomnerd> Oh My God. That Tag.
<otakon> Meanwhile: Both doors will say yes. One will be telling the truth (yes=yes) the other will not(yes=no) that's how.
<Meanwhile> Devonx25: Protip. Never ask for anything unless the streamer says they'll take requests.
<superretroworld> otakon: when does mlp ever come on the streamer
<Randomnerd> superretroworld: Friday night, saturday afternoon.
<otakon> superretroworld: usually only on official movie nights
<Devonx25> ask him to take u to his billage.
<superretroworld> kool
<Devonx25> village*
<otakon> RAWRity: ask him which way leads to the village of liars
<Meanwhile> otakon: Who is to the when where?
<otakon> Meanwhile: why
<sagas> RAWRity: Which way to the village you are from?
<MahBoi777> sagas: okay, so how wud u tell which one is lying?
<Devonx25> american dad is on tv now!. :).
<Randomnerd> Get on top of that cart!
<RAWRity> otakon: won't work. If he tells the truth, he'll point to the village of liars. If he tells lies, he'll point to the village of truth speakers.
<superretroworld> otakon: you mean after when the movie done or on movie nights?
<sagas> RAWRity: Mine works, right?
<RAWRity> sagas: yes.
<sagas> :)
<Randomnerd> Theys show an ep after each movie
<otakon> superretroworld: after the A movie and then after the B movie
<sagas> Im a little logic twilight sparkle
<sagas> I love these
<superretroworld> kk
<MahBoi777> :1
<Meanwhile> How does new meat even get here during the week.
<Randomnerd> Damn that cart went FAR
<Meanwhile> It's beyond me.
<otakon> RAWRity: goddammit then I'm stuck
<otakon> Meanwhile: no idea, but its always nice to see new people here
<RAWRity> otakon: ask "which way to your village?"
<MahBoi777> well there was one guy last night that said he was arguing on some forum and they directed him here :/
<DocSane> Okay... Something went terribly wrong with my mouse.
<Reikim> Is there a stream?
<otakon> RAWRity: but you STILL don't know if he's from the village of liars or the truth speakers then
<Ponies47> Reikim: eeyup
<otakon> MahBoi777: odd
<otakon> Reikim: refersh mate
<Reikim> Ponies47: What is it?
<otakon> brb
<MahBoi777> otakon: yes it is
<RAWRity> If he's from the truthful village, he'll point to the truthful one. If he's from the Liar village, he'll point to the Truthful one, as pointing to the liars one would mean telling the truth.
<Ponies47> Reikim: Wrek is playing TF2
<Alister[M]> Hello Everypony !
<sagas> :)
<RAWRity> otakon: it doesn't matter. Either way he points you to the truthful village, and thus his own place of origin i irrelavent.
<sagas> hi Alister[M]!
<RAWRity> *is
<Devonx25> MLP IS AWESOME!.

<Alister[M]> sagas: I was branded by Mistress Molestia becuz I like being someone's proprety. And now you're creepd out ?
<DocSane> Devonx25: FiM is basically a melding of G1 and MLP Tales
<sagas> Alister[M]: Nope I understand completely

<derpy_pony> hey
<Reikim> WindWhistler: Ahhhh, sunburn. That's too bad wait Meanwhile why would I slap her?!?!
<RaveGraduate> otakon!!!
<WindWhistler> Lol I realized it would sound like I got Sunburn.
<otakon> Steam is having a HUGE sale on Deus Ex Collection!
<MahBoi777> Lol Meanwhile
<otakon> 15 bucks for ALL of the games
<WindWhistler> I mean I have sunburn
<RaveGraduate> otakon: :o
<Reikim> otakon: Buy it. Buy it NAO
<otakon> and the addons for Human Revolution as well
<Devonx25> wtf is the choo choo doin?.
<WindWhistler> But I'm talkiung about the CHARACTER for Skylanders~
<MahBoi777> I had a sunburn once
<Alister[M]> otakon: Buy it filly or razorfist will kill oy
<Wrek> 05THAT IS THE MOST WORTH SALE EVER
<Alister[M]> you*
<Meanwhile> Reikim: what, you never slap someone with sunburn? your handprint totally sticks.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> otakon: No way! :O
<WindWhistler> He's soooo awesome~
<Wrek> 05GO AND GET IT
<Wrek> 05DONT PLAY INVISIBLE WAR
<otakon> Reikim: can't run HR.. already have Deus Ex
<|Discord|> OMG...THIS SONG HAS REVEALD LIFES MEANING TO ME
<otakon> Wrek: I like Invisible War, played it on the Xbox
<Crono_brony> Omnipony: this may sound really stupid, but is this the real omnipony?(the one who made pewdie's dub remix?) or are you just using his name?
<otakon> plus, kind of borke
<otakon> *broke
<WindWhistler> This is what I got: http://images.wikia.com/spyro/images/b/bf/Sunburn_01.jpg
<otakon> thought you guys would like to know though
<Reikim> otakon: This is sad.
<WindWhistler> Isn't he sooooo cool?
<Meanwhile> otakon: "I like Invisible War, played it on the Xbox" That was painful to read.
<WindWhistler> He's half-Phoenix half-dragon~
<Reikim> WindWhistler: Damn that's pretty cool.
<otakon> Reikim: I got 39 dollars to my name, even a 2.45 dollar game is too much
<MahBoi777> gotta admit, that's pretty cool
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: It looks like Spike and Gilda had a baby.
<|Discord|> OH MA GAWD
<otakon> Meanwhile: I DID like it, although universal ammo is still stupid
<Reikim> otakon: I thought you were going to walk to wherever to get a job?
<omnipony> Crono_brony: unfortuantley im not but i wish lol! I do DJ on the otherhand. I just am not as good and i havent made any mlp remixes
<Alister[M]> Wrek: Stop that , Invisible war is good on it's own merits. The hame has just different feel than Deus ex 1. People complained , and later when COD 1 came out a month later , no one had anymore rage to strike the TRUE enemy
<otakon> Reikim: didn't make it to Cambridge, too damn hot
<otakon> Alister[M]: you watched Razorfist too didn't yo?
<Wrek> 05Alister[M]: had they removed the deus ex part of the name i would forgive it
<otakon> Alister[M]: (\
<WindWhistler> All the dragons in Skylanders look awesome
<Crono_brony> omnipony: aww! well thanks for telling me! XD
<otakon> Wrek: that's what they did with Project Snowblind
<Devonx25> SOLRAC is so FUCKING awesome!!!!.
<Meanwhile> Man you got signed.
<omnipony> no problem but I want to make music like he does lol
<otakon> Wrek: THAT was originally gonna be a more action oriented Deus Ex, same universe too but they dropped the name.
<Crono_brony> Devonx25: hay yeah, he is!
<WindWhistler> http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120130082246/spyro/images/3/31/Skylanders_year_of_the_dragon_pic.jpg
<sagas> wait, Wrek is no longer branded?
<otakon> okay, hwere the HELL do they get the audacity to charge the SAME PRICE for a digital version of a new game?
<Meanwhile> otakon: Give them your money.
<Alister[M]> Wrek: Well , that sounds unfair. Play the game again. But keep in mind each game has it's own feel. Deus ex 1 is a conspiration story . Deus Ex 3 is more socio-political and Deus ex 2 a sci-fi story.
<Meanwhile> ALL your money.
<Meanwhile> Muahahahaha
<Meanwhile> Etc.

<otakon> Meanwhile: your loss, good game
<Reikim> Alister[M]: Mmm. Why?
<Meanwhile> otakon: Nope.
<Devonx25> PONIES!!!!
<Alister[M]> Reikim: It's a rather linear dungeon crawler that passes difficulty as depth.
<otakon> Wrek: I've already played and beaten it, but I wonder if they'll release the new bosses on LIVE and PSN for free for owners of the original...
<Crono_brony> Biglaw: Cuz', i can't T.T i'm very bad with instruments other than the bass guitar, and pc synths!
<otakon> Alister[M]: it's not THAT linear
<Alister[M]> otakon: Oh yes it is
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Well, g2g. Bye everypony.
<Meanwhile> Bye ZappyTheUnicorn.
<Reikim> Alister[M]: Hey, there's depth, and then there's just having fun with a challenge. I enjoy both.
<Meanwhile> Implying linearity makes it bad.
<Ponies47> Bye ZappyTheUnicorn :)

<Meanwhile> Devonx25: That was not a smart thing to claim.
<|Discord|> Devonx25 Is just trying to get attention do not bother listening to him
<Crono_brony> Biglaw: I love how you want to help, my fellow brony, but i just ended up taking a break. ^.^;
<Meanwhile> Why are we attempting to sort this muppet out again?
<MahBoi777> Gunthler: ponies
<Gunthler> Devonx25: If you ban evade, its a permaban
<otakon> Devonx25: many have claimed that and all have been banned over and over ad infinium
<Biglaw> Crono_Brony alright then, but if you want help with anything just give me a shout
<otakon> Devonx25: please don't, for your own sake eh?

<Meanwhile> otakon if you try and convince the dense to not be, you're gonna have a bad time.
<otakon> Shizuka: still, I act with civility so it's not an impossible thing
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Why would you hope for an idiot to NOT get banned?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka this is otakon, he does not understand that
<CriticKitten> What's a civility?

<Meanwhile> WHY are we making such a big deal of this?
<otakon> Devonx25: so, enjoy the stream, chat and don't be a ponce eh?
<Devonx25> somepony might be here to enjoy tf2.

<Meanwhile> It wouldn't be the first time a wally has gotten themselves sent to the moon and it won't be the last.
<otakon> Meanwhile: bc we aren't all heartless monsters like you
<ponibas> Shizu, you making friends again?
<Meanwhile> otakon: Bollocks.
<otakon> Meanwhile: a wally?
<Shizuka> 13Meanwhile: it's kind of like watching someone about to throw themselves in front of a bus... you may not care, but there's always some tiny portion of the brain that demands you prevent it
<MahBoi777> lol wally
<otakon> Shizuka: lol
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Says you. I'm a helper, I'd shove.
<Devonx25> the... m-moon?...
<otakon> Shizuka: that is a apt description actually
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Mainly because they're going to make that bus late
<Petrified_Discord> Meanwhile: I'll drive the bus
<otakon> Devonx25: that's what we call banning here for the most part
<Shizuka> 13saxy confirmed a redditor
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and trust me, delayed mass transit because someone did that sucks
<otakon> SaxyPretender: you evil and thus I blame you
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nope, just a New Yorker
<Devonx25> oh dear celestia!.
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: either that or you just cant help but to feel like an asshole for not doing so
<Gunthler>

<otakon> Shizuka: how fitting
<Devonx25> so celestia won't send me to the moon?.
<kidzrul434> I just wish there was a copy of it
<RAWRity> Seriously, I look forward to the day I am done with this summer semester. It's gotten to the point where I've started to hate handicapped people, simply because I know them getting on the bus will slow us down.

<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: I get to wake up at 7:00 am mon-fri, catch the bus at 8:30 after walking half a mile to the bus stop. Then I get to the depot, get on another bus, ride that one to the end of the line, get on a connector bus, get to school just before 10:00 am. Then 2 hours of class. Then back on the connector bus, then the second bus, back to the depot for the 3rd bus, then a half-mile walk back home. In the middle of summer.
<Ponies47> Crono_brony: Okie doki loki

<RAWRity> otakon: I actually think that's incorrect. Part of the cuteness of the show is the ponies expressions and animations, which I don't think would translate well to humans.
<Meanwhile> RustyMeat: dat turtle.
<MahBoi777> RustyMeat: I like its smile
<otakon> Yahooz: on girls? no, not on the chest
<RustyMeat> Its called the real world otakon
<Yahooz> otakon: oh yeah right /)_-
<ponibas> otakon: WHY not?!?!!?
<Yahooz> my bad
<Meanwhile> otakon: That's a turtle.
<drf|laptop> 03cya
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Understood, and in retrospect, mebe I shouldn't have responded.
*Bronysith gives Meanwhile water
<Saturn> 08,01what are we talking about?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: trolololo
<Yahooz> are you turtlely enough for the turtle club?
<otakon> RAWRity: but no, what I'm saying is that if you translated the plots into humans and human like things it wouldn't change the fact that the show is well written and acted.
*Bronysith glomps Saturn
<APS|Evil|Soda> Saturn: Australia
<Saturn> 08,01not to seem 1-dimensional, but i hope it's sex
*Bronysith tramp stamps Wrek with the face of Saturn
<Crono_brony> Randomnerd: then yeah, raven squad is the game for you. it's a FPS, but then a certain points, you have to do RTS view for missions.
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Bronysith> Saturn: of course
<APS|Evil|Soda> LOL
<otakon> Saturn: that if you changed MLP to humans, it would still be good
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...is this Dire Straits?
<ponibas> nothing wrong with that Saturn
<RAWRity> Saturn: otakon thinks MLP would work just as well as if it were about human characters
<Reikim> Saturn: Well we WEREN'T talking about sex, but we can if you want.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Eh, I don't think so.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: hmmm
<Saturn> 08,01they would lose some of their inherent cuteness
<ponibas> saxy: I do't think so
<Saturn> 08,01and charm
<otakon> Meanwhile: how so? a few translations of the pony jokes and such and it would work
<Reikim> inb4 the convo becomes sex
<Meanwhile> Humans are too familiar. The anthropomorphic aspect is endearing without being uncanny valley.
<Dken2021> wassup good people
<Yahooz> MLP Humanized would resemble some weird child of Harry Potter and Avatar
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai Dken2021
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Dken2021!
<otakon> Saturn: yeah, but the character traits and development would be the same
<Saturn> 08,01and also the fact that they're ponies, which is stereotypically a girly thing
<Meanwhile> Allo Dken2021.
<otakon> hiya Dken2021
<ponibas> Reikim: the mods would'nt allow it to digress that far
<Randomnerd> Yahooz: Both spectacular successes
<Yahooz> lali'ho Dken2021
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm almost certain this sounds like Mark Knopler...
<Dken2021> real ponies? wha?
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: how are you today?
<Saturn> 08,01so i guess a lot of people wouldn't have the same kind of introspection and epiphany they have now when realising they like the show
<otakon> Saturn: if humans it would NOT be "inherently" girly.... nothing is inherently ANYTHING by the way.
<Reikim> ponibas: You haven't been around long, have you?
<Tovler> nothing much. Just watching Nintendo Direct.
<Randomnerd> Two great tastes don't always taste together, of course...
<MahBoi777> otakon: do u know Chanokun on youtube? if u don't u shud look it up
<Reikim> Hm
<Reikim> Chat derp
<otakon> MahBoi777: never heard of him
<MahBoi777> hey Dken2021
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i didn't say "inherently"
<Yahooz> Real ponies? naaaaaah they have to be magical you see
<Saturn> 08,01i said "stereotypically"
<hen3ry> ah, my space shuttle had an epic crash... the cockpit broke off and landed on top of the rocket tower lol
<APS|Evil|Soda> ponibas: big brother is coming back to oz
<ponibas> Reikim: off and on for about 6 months or so.. I'd have to ask Sumica when I started coming here
*ponibas is NOT an Aussie
<APS|Evil|Soda> ponibas: oh lol
<Saturn> 08,01i did say "inherent cuteness"
<ponibas> i've known Sumica for 7 years?
<Saturn> 08,01and i do stand by that
<APS|Evil|Soda> ponibas: u said aussie aussie aussie tho? :'(
<Saturn> 08,01ponies are cuter than humans
<Randomnerd> RustyMeat: Seriously, is that a fish?
<ponibas> indeed
<Reikim> ponibas: Yeah...the other day we digressed to interspecies sex...and this morning |Discord| shared with us his Lyra story...so basically just about anything can happen in this chat.
<RustyMeat> Its a turtle
<Sumica> 00,10I would have to go in to my windows.old directory to check the masive log
<RustyMeat> Its a turtle Randomnerd
<APS|Evil|Soda> ponibas: u cant say then
<Saturn> 08,01we tend to talk about interspecies sex a lot in here
<RustyMeat> That eats jellyfish
<panda> Saturn yes, yes they were
<Crono_brony> goodnight, everypony! i had a great chat with you all! ^.^
<otakon> Saturn: that's the thing, it's only stereotypical because we LABEL it as such. Nothing is "cute/girly" inherently, it's all labels we give it to identify it here
<APS|Evil|Soda> ponibas: u have to be aussie or live in oz
<ponibas> I think I was here for the interspecies thing
<otakon> night Crono_brony take care
<Dken2021> goodnight Crono_brony
<Saturn> 08,01i think you guys are holding out on me with regard to your fetishes.
<Randomnerd> RustyMeat: lol, I DO hate jellyfish.
<Everlasting_Joy> Night night Crono_brony!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14o_o
<otakon> RustyMeat: dude, that turtle is DAMN scary
<Caramel> 2,14 despite my best attempts to STOP that kind of talk in here -_-
<ponibas> Saturn: I have a fetish for sex =p
<Dken2021> I'm so confused @_@
<Reikim> Oh hey, Val's back.
<Saturn> 08,01actually, let's not talk about that
<panda> Saturn lmao, well tell us yours first xD
<RAWRity> Saturn: meh, I'm rather open about my lack of kinks, actually.
<Sumica> 00,10Is't that legal in your state too ponibas?
*ponibas apologizes to Caramel
<Reikim> What's up, Val?
<otakon> Saturn: good idea
<Saturn> 08,01panda: i will not

<Meanwhile> Val is going to trident you.
<RustyMeat> PENGUINS
<panda> Saturn O///o if you want
<Yahooz> One does not simply capatilize otakons name...
<RAWRity> Funfact: While Florida recently made bestiality illegal...the law says nothing about oral, and that loophole has apparently been abused something awful.
<otakon> yeah, i don't get pings if you do
<APS|Evil|Soda> RustyMeat: PENGUINS WHERE * grabs his binoculars*
<otakon> panda: just tab it
<Dken2021> RAWRity oh dear god

<SaxyPretender> 0,14I liek it
<Yahooz> no kidding

<RAWRity> And thus why Florida proves itself to be the worst state ever.

<panda> Saturn good plan :)

<FancyDerpy> I don't get way this website is called bronystate if this is website has more about gaming and watching nostalga than ponies?
<otakon> apparently liking a cartoon that promotes frienship and being decent is a CRAZY OBSESSION!
<ButlerYahooz> yep
<ButlerYahooz> thats how it works
<Reikim|Gardener> otakon: That's insane!
<otakon> FancyDerpy: it's for bronies to come in and socialize
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14well, FancyDerpy, if we just showed ponies, we'd call it PonyState
<MahBoi777> otakon: and eating toilet paper or drinking gasoline isn't. seems legit

<RainbowCrashie> The funny thing is that the people who made the brony song I've also seen thier sonic the musical (A live action little play) and pac man the musical ( stop motion musical)

<cratorkid> 6_9
<HyperMetalLugia> ..ugly
<Ponies47> Sparkle sparkle sparkle. HI EVERYPONY I'M BACK! :)
<Chimera> Yes.
<Chimera> Very.
<Meanwhile> Ah. One of the unexperienced who isn't aware that "Brony" is a unisex term.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and you needed to use caplocks for that Brenna ?
<Brenna> YES THEY DO
<MasterBoss43> He i swedish 6-9
<Sylandest> howdy, ponibas|D3
<Firelight> YAY
<HyperMetalLugia> it makes
<Dken2021> allo Ponies47
<panda> Brenna! You are awesome /)
<Sylandest> and Ponies47 XD
<MahBoi777> no TOY_PON32!
<Chimera> Also IMO it's too early for a new 3DS system :|
<HyperMetalLugia> the DS Phat look stylish
<ponibas|D3> uhh
<Wrek> 05Shizuka? will you do me the honor of permahammer?
*Meanwhile slaps panda with a brick.
<Firelight> (\
<MasterBoss43> 6_9
<Chimera> haha
<Devonx25> im a brony.
<cratorkid> hey Ponies47
<Shizuka> 13happy to
<Chimera> I liked the design of the 3DS
<Brenna> a pegisister is a female brony
<Sylandest> ponibas|D3: mispinged, my apologies :$
<Chimera> This is just
<Chimera> It looks like a thinner version of my Pandora system
*ponibas|D3 cheers the impending ban
<HyperMetalLugia> Looks really really
<TOY_PON32> Not the permahammer!!!
<RoboGerbil> a female brony is still a brony
<Firelight> Thanks for the team fortress 2!
<Meanwhile> Brenna: The term "brony" is usually considered genderless.
<Devonx25> i need an OC.
<Chimera> with LOL CURVES EVERYWHERE
<HyperMetalLugia> fragile.
<Chimera> It does >_>
<panda> Meanwhile, why did you do that?
<MahBoi777> oh no who's gettin permahammered?
<Alister[M]> It's like in that song ''It's hard being a brony'' : They try to make it seem like it's worse ofr the girls. I'm pretty sure there is more social stigma for guys
<TOY_PON32> I can't look
<Meanwhile> panda: Because that was pathetic.
<Wrek> 05this song
<cratorkid> Brenna: Meanwhile is right
<HyperMetalLugia> At least the 3DS plastic was pretty good/thick compared to the DS/DSi
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> Devonx25: Did I hear OC drawing?
<Wrek> 05imagine it to fit the image
<Brenna> yes. but think about it BROny
<Firelight> oh....man.
<ponibas|D3> ....
<Devonx25> yep.
<Wrek> 05that flutterhsy is the main char in the lyrics
<Ponies47> Wait who's getting banned?!?! :O
<Brenna> pegiSISTER
<Firelight> eeeyup.
<Sylandest> Wrek: my mind is blown
<Kandarihu> Ponies47: Devonx25
<Devonx25> bunny_maid_luna : yep
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> who is getting banned?
<Alister[M]> Brenna: Why do you WANT to divide us by our sex ? what's next ? race ?
<RoboGerbil> hey anyone see this new skyrim mod? Skyrim Online, #1 on the workshop?
<cratorkid> bannhamer? oh nooo
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what did Devonx25 do?
<Ponies47> Kandarihu: Oh dear O_O
<Devonx25> bunny_maid_luna : i need an OC.
<Ponies47> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Spammed like crazy
<Shamroc> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: bassicly said he was trying to ban evade
<Meanwhile> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Being generally annoying and not heeding warnings.
<RainbowCrashie> Devonx25 : Of coarse were all bronies, This website is titled brony state (int int!)
<panda> I say let brenna call herself what she wants ^-^
<Kandarihu> For dodging a timed ban
<Brenna> Alister[M] Its just a simple joke
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ahh
<Devonx25> i did nothing!.
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> Devonx25: How will this OC look like? :)
<Prick> ah yes i am back once again
<Alister[M]> Brenna: Well it's not funny
<cratorkid> panda: agreed
<Alister[M]> Prick: you're such a prick
*TOY_PON32 is staying far away from the chat
<Shizuka> 13[22:53] [ Devonx25] i tried tor.
<Brenna> BRONY'S AND PEGISISTER SHOULD NOT FIGHT
<Shizuka> 13[22:53] [ Devonx25] other proxys.
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: admittign to tryign
<Brenna> *Pegisister's
<Shamroc> Bunny_Maid_Luna....i suggest holding off on that...cause i dont think he will be here much longer
<Devonx25> bunny_maid_luna : idk. i just need 1.
<Prick> ah yes, but everyone loves meh :)
<Firelight> Yeah! <3 and tolerate!
<cratorkid> <3
<RainbowCrashie> I suck don't I :S
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> Shamroc: Okay :)
*ponibas|D3 keeps a nervous eye on Shizuka
<Kandarihu> To think. I spent a combined total of nearly 7 days in self-imposed honor ban mode. And the day after I come back, someone dodges a REAL ban.
<Devonx25> the more i get banned the more research i get done and the closer i get to getting past it!.
<Rain> loving this, Wrek
<Brenna> EVERYONE THAT HAS A PROBLEM WITH FEMALE BRONY'S BEING CALLED PEGISISTER MAKE A :[ FACE
<Kandarihu> Er, well, it's kind of the same day.
<Shizuka> 13Turn Caps Lock off please.
<Alister[M]> Brenna: Call yourself whatever you want. Just don't any BS like Pegasisters got it worse
<HyperMetalLugia> But really, no second circle pad? :|

<drf-Droid> LOL 3DS XL
<Shizuka> 13you're already banned
<Kandarihu> Well, brony is a portmandeau between bro and pony. I've been trying to figure out a female equivalent term, but the only ideas I can think of are problematic.
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, do that on the 3DS XL and it'll be perfect
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Shizuka> 13oh he left
<HyperMetalLugia> native res whee

<Alister[M]> I won't calm down ! I fucked it up ! I missed my chance. Now I have to live with the regret forever
<Rain> who, Shizuka?

<Meanwhile> Brenna: Because pegasister sounds daft.
<HyperMetalLugia> NOOO
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<TOY_PON32> You fuck with the mods. You're gonna have a bad time.
<Sylandest> Wrek: no complaints here
<Kandarihu> The price of peace and freedom, I guess. Eternal vigilance.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<Alister[M]> Brenna: Because we are ONE community. We have no uses for gender or race.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Nittany_Discord
<Firelight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPqjKk_xCo
<Shamroc> oh hai Nittany_Discord
<Rain> Brenna, because it makes it seem like two different fandoms, also giving two different names based on gender is kinda annoying :|
<Ponies47> Back :)
<Rain> plus, Im pretty bro
<Saturn> 08,01Brenna: why make the distinction?
<Brenna> I AM SORRY
<MasterBoss43> My little pony Freindship is magic > Couse the older versions is to mainstream.

<Brenna> god
<Firelight> Yeah....
<SaxyCowboy> 0,14if they wanna say it, then let 'em say it
<Meanwhile> Firelight: No non image links during the stream.
<Ponies47> Thank you MahBoi777 :P
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
<Saturn> 08,01does it really matter so much whether you're male or female that you need a seperate fandom name?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Rain and gets wet.
<Firelight> fine....
<panda> ^
<TOY_PON32> I agree with SaxyCowboy
*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord.
<JRP2234> wtf did i walk in to now?
<panda> Saturn, agreed
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Meanwhile
*Rain hugs Shizuka and Nittany_Discord
<Rain> exactly, Saturn
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thank you <3
<Meanwhile> Personally I hate gender wars more than I hate race ones.
<HyperMetalLugia> Demo time
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<ponibas|D3> hey Nittany_Discord
<Ponies47> *Does the Freedom Day
<Brenna> i gonna go to a diff chat room for a little bit
<Ponies47> dance
<durger> Brony draws the horse!
<MahBoi777> hey Nittany_Discord!
<Yahooz> hmmm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did I hop into a pegasister argument?
<WindWhistler> I can't believe this is happening to me.
<Yahooz> yes
<Meanwhile> Sadly yes.
<Firelight> *sigh*
<WindWhistler> I lost BOTH of my Skylanders games.
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: eeyup :(
<panda> Yeah nitt
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: oh noes!
<IowaBrony> I think of brony as a mix between /b/ and pony. That's just me, though. That's why I call me as well as all female fans bronies.
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: That sucks.
<TOY_PON32> We dun scared the newbie
<WindWhistler> So I bought that figure for nothing.
<WindWhistler> I have turned the house upside down looking for them.
<Firelight> hm
<WindWhistler> The only way I can buy another copy of either is to get the whole starter pack again.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everypony is a brony no matter what gender. End.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> WindWhistler the toys or the discs ?
<panda> I say everyone should just call it what they want....
<Firelight> Thank you!
<MahBoi777> K
<WindWhistler> Meaning I have to pay $120 again
<drf-Droid> so
<JRP2234> i think of brony as.....wait......THIS ARGUMENT IS REALLY STUPID
<Kandarihu> IowaBrony: but that analogy implies that we browse /b/
<drf-Droid> I'm watching Puella Magi
<WindWhistler> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: the disk and the game card
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01WindWhistler: You lost it?
<WindWhistler> I lost the 3DS game and the Wii game
<hen3ry> I demand strict definitions for made up terms!
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Yes yes :)
<Firelight> Can we just ssssh.. wwatchign somthing here -.-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You misplaced it?
<WindWhistler> I have NO idea how the Wii game went missing.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> WindWhistler ouch
<Brenna> im back
<Alister[M]> chat derp
<Chimera> SMASH
<Chimera> FOUR
<Chimera> OMG
<WindWhistler> I KNOW I put it away with the other games
<MahBoi777> wb Brenna
<Wrek> 05also a sogn that fits
<Brenna> :|
<HyperMetalLugia> :O
<WindWhistler> But I have no idea where I last put the 3DS game...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd try to get a spare since you have proof of reciept.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> WindWhistler: what game?
<WindWhistler> This. Sucks.
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: Could someone have moved it?
<Brenna> Im still upset
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*receipt.
<Chimera> ugh
<Chimera> it was just partnership
<MasterBoss43> What paint program is he using?
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: That's what I thought, but no one in this family cares about anyone but themselves. Everytime I'm looking for something and ask one of them, they always say "no" before I can even finish.
<Chimera> stuff
<Chimera> that was lame
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: trace your steps, perhaps?
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Brenna> IF I WANT TO BE A PEGISISTER WHY CANT I?
<drf-Droid> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> trolltendo
<Yahooz> you can
<Yahooz> go ahead
<cratorkid> why cant you?
<MasterBoss43> Brenna, i see nothing that can stop you.
<WindWhistler> Sylandest: It was too long ago to remember
<Brenna> AND NO ONE TELL ME TO COOL ON THE CAPS
<MasterBoss43> So go ahead.
<HyperMetalLugia> they better allow us to move ambassador stuff
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> WindWhistler: what game was it?
<Yahooz> inb4 Wrek
<Meanwhile> Brenna: If you don't cool the caps you'll get kicked.
<drf-Droid> you can
<WindWhistler> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Skylanders.
<Kandarihu> So when adults got into MLP FiM, the adult guys were known as bronies and women were known as pegasisters. But the word pegasister was repulsive so the women started calling themselves bronies as well.
<Alister[M]> Brenna: You gonna get banned girl
<drf-Droid> I did it
<TOY_PON32> ^
<Firelight> Be right back.. I have to charge my laptop.. =/
<MasterBoss43> Brenna, cool down the caps. Are you trying to caps me to death_
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: hmm...perhaps a place where you put things meant for later? A spot that you dont always put thought to?
<ponibas|D3> Brenna, if a mod asks you.. do it
<MasterBoss43> ?|
<Wrek> 05Brony: term used to cathegorize fans of a certain show. unisex.
<HyperMetalLugia> good
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<Wrek> 05there's the definition
<Brenna> Am i gonna get banned?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> WindWhistler: well that sucks
<TOY_PON32> Newbies: they never learn
<IowaBrony> Kandarihu: I guess my argument is invalid.
<Yahooz> Brenna: for allcaps
<hen3ry> Brianna, call yourself whatever you like, just don't call me late to dinner
<Yahooz> excess use of them
<Meanwhile> Brenna: If you continue to make a nuisance of yourself, yes.
<Chimera> Kirby Generations
*Chimera hides
<Brenna> ITS NOT BRIANNA
<JRP2234> Wrek THIS ARGUMENT IS REALLY POINT LESS
<Wrek> 05and why would Brenna get banned?
<WindWhistler> Sylandest: No. I just put them wherever. I can't believe how stupid that was of me. The 3DS games are small. Someone probably threw it out.
<MahBoi777> Brenna: u won't if u don't all caps for every sentence, just sayin :$
<ponibas|D3> gocry someplace else
<Alister[M]> And of course : since a mod said it, it's the truth
<Ponies47|Shower> I'm gonna go take a shower. Be back in a few :P
<panda> Wrek, this arguemnt?
<Wrek> 05JRP2234: HOW DOES THIS LOOK TO YOU? DOESA IT LOOK PELASEANT STOP THE FUCKIGN ALLCAPS
<Brenna> for callin myself a pegisister
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: a possibility, but maybe not yet. I'd keep looking
<MasterBoss43> What paint program is he using? >S
<panda> Wrek, you're scaring me :(
<MasterBoss43> :S
<WindWhistler> But I have no idea where the WII game went. I put it with all the other Wii games, but then it's not there.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol Wrek
<Brenna> thats why i would get banned
<TOY_PON32> Wrek scares everyone
<Biglaw|AFK> ....
<SaxyCowboy> 0,14As Liz from Shaun from of the Dead said, "Can we all just calm. The fuck. Down."
<WindWhistler> Sylandest: I've looked through everything like ten times.
<HyperMetalLugia> I want my starfox U
<Alister[M]> Where did I go right ?
<ponibas|D3> lol Saxy
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SaxyCowboy: ^
<Meanwhile> Yeah this is beginning to drag. Put a sock in it.
<hen3ry> mmmm..... brains
<WindWhistler> Well, I can't look in one of the places anymore because my brother has a bunch of friends over...
<MasterBoss43> I agree SaxyCowboy.
<cratorkid> nice one SAxtCowboy
<Wrek> 05not bannable Brenna. but keep in mind many think the term is unizex and think that by adding a male and female term would cause sexism and stuff and too complicated to explain in one sentence.
<Wrek> 05and for this discussin
<Wrek> 05we will now drop it
<TOY_PON32> Shut up guys. Just let it go.
<Wrek> 05-----------------
<Yahooz> agreed
<Brenna> fine
<TOY_PON32> Thanks Wrek
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: hmm...then it may really be gone, which is a shame. You do have the receipt, correct?
<Meanwhile> You don't agree, that wasn't a suggestion.
<Meanwhile> That was an order.
<cratorkid> ty Wrek
<Chimera> I love how I heard almost nothing about Kirby's 20th
