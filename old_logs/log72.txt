<Silverscreen> 11The weather started getting rough, The mighty ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew, The serpent would be lost....the serpent would be lost. The ship set ground on a random shore To be stuck there quite a while, The ponies left stuck to run amuck, Right on Equestria Isle.
<Silverscreen> 11So this is the tale of the castaways, They're here for a long, long time. They'll have to make the best of things, It's an uphill climb. The first mate and the Skipper too, Will do their very best, To make the others comfortable, In the tropic island nest.

<Silverscreen> 11whichever you want.
<Dave_BroZilla> Dost thou have Sherlock, Dari?
<Silverscreen> 11wait.
<RobotPinkie> Nah it's usually better, Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> 11Did you watch Monty Python with us, Dermathil?
<prince-dari> Because they don't go aroudn killing everyone?
<Denied_Existence> Silverscreen, would I be able to receive training as a mod? I don't have much experience...:(

<prince-dari> Maybe that's how it's done in America, but not here. :P
<Denied_Existence> Oh, good
<Dashite> Mod training = throwing you in the lake to teach you how to swim.
<RobotPinkie> That's how it's done right!
<Silverscreen> 11no, they were stupid because they gave the opponent ample opportunity to kill them.
<RobotPinkie> lol
<prince-dari> How did they?
<Nittany_Tiger> Here's a banstick. Use it.
<Denied_Existence> but...but...I know how to swim:(
<Denied_Existence> ....
<Silverscreen> 11In the woods.
<prince-dari> They had a policeman with them.
<Dermathil> I think Monty Python was the night I first Joined, but I joined and the movie was done.
<Silverscreen> 11Who turned on them.
<prince-dari> Would you assume he's one of the cannibals too outright?
<Dave_BroZilla> wat
<RobotPinkie> lol moar torchwood plz?
<Dave_BroZilla> wat
<Silverscreen> 11No, but if he's turning on them, then he's not a fucking cop, imo
<Dermathil> silverscreen: so?
<Denied_Existence> THAT WAS THE BEST DAY EVER
<prince-dari> He turned on them, then he would have killed Owen.
<prince-dari> If they tried anything.
<prince-dari> You almost never see people shoot in films in situations like that.
<Dermathil> silverscreen: what night was Monty Python?
<prince-dari> One side always puts their guns down.
<prince-dari> It's not stupid, that's just the way people always do it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I need a new mouse >:/
<RobotPinkie> Either that or everyone gets shot
<Denied_Existence> Silverscreen, if y'all accept me, would I be able to start training or would I need to wait for this friday?

<NightSeas> 12Are they new, like new, or used?
<Silverscreen> 11The fact that this melody matches the other songs is really coincidental, as it's not heard in the other songs.

<Silverscreen> 11Nowhere near as good as Weird all.
<prince-dari> It doesn't really work that well for all the songs they do here.
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<Silverscreen> 11Weird Al could fuse ANYTHING together and make it sound good.

<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I wouldn't mind wired mice if my desk wasn't so big
<Dave_BroZilla> They do RHCP in one of the other 4 Chord song variation
<Silverscreen> 11wait...they seriously just tried to say that musicians don't take too much effort to do what they do?!
<Dermathil> eeyup.
<Silverscreen> 11LOAD. OF. FUCKING. SHIT.
*Denied_Existence shrugs.
*Silverscreen 11shuts up before he goes full rage.
<prince-dari> Lol.l
<Dave_BroZilla> Much nicer way to put it is anyone can be a pop star with those four chords
<Dermathil> They are shitting over musical wonders like Miracle of Sound.
<Denied_Existence> TORCHWOOD BITCHES
<ValtheJean> I can see why they'd say that given what passes for "musician" these days.
<Denied_Existence> LETS KILL SOME FUKKEN ALIENS
<ValtheJean> but
<ValtheJean> ACTUAL musicians but a load of effort into it
<RobotPinkie> They're kind of poking fun at their own idea, actually
<Silverscreen> 11But those four chords aren't even heard in half of the songs they mentioned.
<Dave_BroZilla> 1812?
<The_Si> Angry sex incoming?
<Silverscreen> 11It's just coincidence that they match.
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: look miracle of sound up on youtube. And tell me with a straight face that this isn't a good musician.
<Dave_BroZilla> At this time Canada is burning down the White House for lulz
<FlutterHi> is this the wood thing?
<prince-dari> After this episode it puts us half way through the series.
<prince-dari> Well, more than half way I suppose.
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil never heard it...but I wasn't targeting a specific artist
<NightSeas> 12Wow, that's really good Umbreon lol
<ValtheJean> I was saying that a LOT of people considered "musicians" are less than sub-par
<Denied_Existence> FUKKEN ALIENS!
<Dermathil> valthejean: he's a modern musician who actually is so good he got picked up by the Escapist to make songs every two week about video games.
<drfsupercenter> 03god dang it
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid video got blocked
<Dermathil> And they are above-par.
<NightSeas> 12I'm not sure if even I can make decks like that

<drf|laptop> 03I don't burn at all
<drf|laptop> 03I don't think I've worn sunscreen in about 5 years
<SilverSonic> I surprisinglu dont tan much .-.
<Kosoveon> it's always really hot and sunny here so sunscreen is a must if you're out for more than like a half hour
<RobotPinkie> What dicks
<Ziltoid> LOL YOURE ALL TRAPPED
<drf|laptop> 03but then again
<drf|laptop> 03LOL going outside
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Angel_Espeon> 13In all honesty, after the first few days I found more entertainment through playing my DS at the hotel than going out for the day |D
<drf|laptop> 03Yep
<Kosoveon> that's how a lot of my trip went, outside of meeting family members and visiting monuments and stuff
<drf|laptop> 03there's nothing to do outside
<Kosoveon> I'd just crash on the bed/laptop and be lazy and not go outside
<drf|laptop> 03meeting more than family members *cough*
<Kosoveon> where it's like 96 with humidity
<drf|laptop> 03but yes, being lazy is what makes the world go round
<Angel_Espeon> 13Plus it wasn't as hot indoors
<Ziltoid> logic
<Kosoveon> yep, drf
<Kosoveon> but that's how most of my trip went
<RobotPinkie> Gives you a Little Richard?
<prince-dari> THE ROOM
<Ziltoid> wut?
<The_Si> What a story Mark.
<Kosoveon> it was only when I met aeroslash that I really got out and did stuff
<Kosoveon> and that was for like four out of the 21 days of the trip
<Dashite> THE ROOM?
<drf|laptop> 03when I went to Florida to see my grandparents I basically just used my computer all day
<drf|laptop> 03I'm like, screw going golfing, I don't golf

<drf|laptop> 03i kept getting 1s and 2s and the CPUs would get like 10s and get the stars >_>
<Angel_Espeon> 13My mum seemed to temporarily forget what a cactus was yesterday
<Angel_Espeon> 13we walked past several large cactuses and she pointed at one and said "what the hell is that?"
<Dermathil> mexican standoff incoming, again.

<Ziltoid> lol wut
<Angel_Espeon> 13I find it funny when girls ask you whether they look better in one outfit or another, but they look terrible in both
<Dermathil> That incoming ep dealing with that foreshadowing was pants-on-head-retarded levels of awesome.
<Kosoveon> but you have to say they look good anyway
<RobotPinkie> what episode is that?
<Kosoveon> or be honest and lose a friendship XD
<Dermathil> series 1 finale

<prince-dari> Dat foreshadowing
<drf|laptop> 03and even when I go "shopping", it's like to Target, or somewhere like Micro Center or Worst Buy
<Dermathil> I remember that one too.
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Kosoveon> I view shopping as a solo experience honestly
<Barry> I wonder if what happened in the pony story "The Room" has actually happened before?
<drf|laptop> 03or maybe GameStop if I'm really that bored
<drf|laptop> 03I view shopping as going to www.amazon.com and clicking around
<Kosoveon> I don't want to brodcast what I'm buying to another person other than the cashier
<Kosoveon> thats prolly just me
<drf|laptop> 03because LOL, paying too much for stuff
<Dermathil> I REMEMBER THAT EPISODE
<Lati> 12If I go out of the house to shop, it's either to dvd,game,anime or manga shops
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just don't go shopping
<drf|laptop> 03people always ask how I buy such nice things
<Dermathil> THE WHOLE STORY OF THE ALIEN EYE
<drf|laptop> 03i'm like "it's because unlike you, I don't go to malls"
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHA
<prince-dari> I remember that one too. XD
<Dermathil> That episode is gonna be brilliant.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL I don't go shopping either, unless I'm bored, looking around computer stores is always fun

<Nittany_Tiger> Has anyone read the updated comments from the Colbert story on EqD?
<Dave_BroZilla> nope.avi
<Barry> Colbert?
<Ziltoid> the one with lauren faust?
<RobotPinkie> nope, what are they about?
<Denied_Existence> And that, fillies and colts, is the guide to preforming a live autopsy on your patient
<Nittany_Tiger> No, some of them that state that bronies are pushing their culture on others.
<Denied_Existence> prince-dari bot post 2723
<prince-dari> 1. You got the number wrong.
<Dave_BroZilla> Wait...is he talking to his older self?

<Denied_Existence> HEY, I GET POINTS FOR TRYING FOR THE HELL OF IT
<prince-dari> No.
<prince-dari> To his son.
<Dave_BroZilla> oh true
<Denied_Existence> Mostly to complete the mood
<prince-dari> Ohai Polarfire.
<Denied_Existence> I mean COME ON, the mood just ISNT complete without RBD to accompany YOU.
<Nittany_Tiger> :.
<Nittany_Tiger> :/
<Dave_BroZilla> ....oh God...who read that one fic where Big Mac suffered Alzheimer's?
<Barry> not me
<Denied_Existence> You must admit, we have all kinda shipped you, prince-dari, and RBD together by now.
<Flareon> hm
<Denied_Existence> Your like the odd couple
<Dave_BroZilla> oh lawdy...it was sad
<Polarfire> ohai dari :D
<prince-dari> All I remember was that there was suggestion that RBD took advantage of me when I was drunk is the story.

<RobotPinkie> So the point about the Colbert thing is that bronies are pushing their culture on unwilling subjects?
<Ziltoid> @sexmeter torchwood
<Steven_Magnet> 6 torchwood is 53% sex. (934)
<prince-dari> About right. ^

<RobotPinkie> TBH I find the complaint moronic. One guy making a FiM-based physics presentation = fine and not attention horsing. ANY other mention of FiM = attention horsing... wat?
<HyperMetalLugia> No Wheatly+? :P
<RobotPinkie> People will mention shit they like, all the Harry Potter mania isn't bothering me one bit.
<drf|laptop> 03it's old
<drf|laptop> 03it came out before Portal 2
<Dave_BroZilla> oh he mad
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah, I see
<RobotPinkie> lol not really, I just think someone's trolling on EQD
<Ziltoid> @liesmeter torchwood
<Nittany_Tiger> The pony spamming issue is two-sided I guess. Both sides have a point. It all comes down to making everyone aware of us vs. pushing MLP in everyone's face.
<Steven_Magnet> 6 torchwood is 50% lies. (936)
<Nittany_Tiger> It's possible Pinkie.
<Dave_BroZilla> @liesmeter Steven_Magnet

<Denied_Existence> WHY CANT I FIND THIS COMMENT YOU SPEAK OF!?
<Nittany_Tiger> It's actually more than one comment.
<Denied_Existence> BECAUSE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMMENTS!
<Nittany_Tiger> There are actually about 300.

<Steven_Magnet> 6 The amount of additional pony needed in this chat is 79% . (941)
<Dave_BroZilla> If Harkness says it all goes black, I guess that means the writers are hardcore athiests?
<Nittany_Tiger> http://pastebin.com/Pff1yUw5 <- Another
<RobotPinkie> Not really
<Denied_Existence> In theory, we should STOP trying to get haters to join, and try more to get the fandom to noticed! We already have an excellent track records of joining BEFORE EQD!
<Denied_Existence> So in theory (again) the more we spread, the more we gather
<RobotPinkie> They could be moral christians who believe in the philosophy of Jesus
<prince-dari> What your face looks like when you come.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Ziltoid> wut
<RobotPinkie> They could be jews (The Mel Gibson theory)

<Nittany_Tiger> http://pastebin.com/DAfm7Qb5 Three
<Dave_BroZilla> Oh God...I'm going to hell for laughing at that, RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> lol, I take that as a compliment
<Denied_Existence> This is something not based off of GOD or GOVERNMENT
<Dave_BroZilla> As you should
<Denied_Existence> Therefore it can appeal to ANYONE
<Dave_BroZilla> DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
<Denied_Existence> .....

<HyperMetalLugia> Duh

<Angel_Espeon> 13Goodnight all :3
*Denied_Existence shrugs
<Soital> 12LOL WTF its 6am
<Nittany_Tiger> Nvm then.
<Nittany_Tiger> Don't need to start a religious argument here.
<RobotPinkie> No, the writers of the show
<Denied_Existence> I think haters are people who aren't confident in their masculinity.
<RobotPinkie> Referring to stream
<Denied_Existence> People who don't like the show, just don't like the show.
<Denied_Existence> They don't try to stop it
<RobotPinkie> I can see why people would be annoyed with people attention whoring, like the specific guy who's pointing himself out as the origin of the petition, sure.
<Denied_Existence> Exactly
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<Denied_Existence> But this is a mass of different races, cultures, groups, and minds
<Nittany_Tiger> I myself think the idea of the show is good and should be spread. We need love and tolerance these days.
<Denied_Existence> ^
<Denied_Existence> This is EXACTLY what I think
<Denied_Existence> What BAD can come of FRIENDSHIP and TOLERANCE!?
<Nittany_Tiger> Nothing.
<RobotPinkie> but ultimately it's a lot like drawball, people will plan raids to show their support for FiM, and do something cool with it. I think getting mentioned on the Colbert Report is a pretty cool thing, so.

<Mikey> just now she asked me to mail some speaking sequences
<Mikey> not sure what for but either way hgurdighrihgrid
<Lambda> :D
<Lambda> Nice!
<Lambda> about getting the internship
<Mikey> yeahhh I'm hoping so at least

<Lambda> as for the speaking sequences though, I wonder what those would be for
<Mikey> maybe they're going to use it in a live video or something
<Mikey> if they do I don't mind :P
<Lambda> oh, maybe

<drf|laptop> 03....
<drf|laptop> 03Glacymr
<drf|laptop> 03I'm kinda scared
<Glacymr> 12?
<drf|laptop> 03I was eating popcorn and literally started tasting metal
<drf|laptop> 03and guess what
<drf|laptop> 03my filling
<drf|laptop> 03fell out
<drf|laptop> 03x.x
<drf|laptop> 03there's literally now a hole in my tooth
<drf|laptop> 03I didn't even think fillings could fall out like that
<Glacymr> 12yeah.... i think you should have that checked at
<drf|laptop> 03I will be
<Aurora> so either the filling was falling out in the first place, or the tooth is rotting inside out
<drf|laptop> 03I already told my mom to schedule an appointgment with the dentist
<drf|laptop> 03-g
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03you know how I said it hurt?
<drf|laptop> 03it doesn't hurt now
<Aurora> causing it to fall out
<Aurora> yeh
<drf|laptop> 03the hole
<Aurora> hmm
<Aurora> that might be it then
<drf|laptop> 03but what I don't get is
<drf|laptop> 03How can a filling hurt?
<Glacymr> 12was probably a really bad filling
<drf|laptop> 03It's not part of your tooth at all
<Glacymr> 12done by someone who went to dental school for like 2 hours
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03dude
<drf|laptop> 03my dentist has been a dentist for years
<drf|laptop> 03I trust him :|
<drf|laptop> 03maybe it was just because he was pressed for time LOL
<Aurora> it might have been incorrectly rubbing against your tooth
<Glacymr> 12even the professionals make mistakes from time to time
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03the dentist has no openings this week so I have to wait til next week I think... is it...bad to have a hole in my tooth like that?
<drf|laptop> 03or should i be fine?
<Glacymr> 12well
<Glacymr> 12there is a reason we get those holes filled in
<Kyu> 07just avoid getting food stuck in it
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Glacymr> 12yeah
<drf|laptop> 03it's like the very far right tooth
<Glacymr> 12no steak for you
<drf|laptop> 03I can't really reach it iwth a toothbrush even
<drf|laptop> 03so I shouldn't have to worry
<drf|laptop> 03and Glacymr I thought I already told you I don't lik esteak
<Kyu> 07and it hurts because the hole often goes through to the nerves
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Glacymr> 12no eating steak that Light_Latias force feeds you
<drf|laptop> 03how come it no longer hurts now that the filling fell out?
*Kyu shrugs
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<drf|laptop> 03anyway see
<drf|laptop> 03here's the weird thijng
<drf|laptop> 03after that filling fell out
<drf|laptop> 03I got all the food out of my mouth and stuff
<Glacymr> 12maybe there was some sort of pressure inside the tooth
<drf|laptop> 03but then when I went to keep eating, I still tasted metal
<drf|laptop> 03so I dunno if it maybe just didn't all come out at once
<Glacymr> 12that would of course cause pain and the pressure finally released itself when the filling fell out
<drf|laptop> 03or if somethingelse is going on :/
<drf|laptop> 03pressure inside the tooth? is that normal?
<drf|laptop> 03I've never had cavities before like a month ago so I really dunno about this stuff
<Glacymr> 12i'm not a dentist
<drf|laptop> 03I know
<drf|laptop> 03but you have more experience with fillings than I do LOL
<Kyu> 07that's because metal fillings have tiny amounts of mercury

<Glacymr> 12you are better off asking this guy
<drf|laptop> 03...isn't mercury toxic?
<Glacymr> 12yes
<drf|laptop> 03frick LOL
<drf|laptop> 03if I die
<drf|laptop> 03then goodbye
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Kyu> 07if it comes loose, the stuff sealed under would rub off easy
<Kyu> 07and it isn't in that amount
<Glacymr> 12yeah
<drf|laptop> 03wait, so what are you saying? That it would have not all fell out in one piecde?
<drf|laptop> 03-d
<Glacymr> 12fish has mercury
<Aurora> fillings are made using silver and mercury
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I should totally ask for 24 karat gold :D
*drf|laptop hides
*Aurora learned this from a CSI episode
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I know some gangsters and whatnot get gold fillings instead of silver
<Kyu> 07no, it's just that the mercury in the fillings will rub off from the silver easily
<Kyu> 07and lol
<drf|laptop> 03so that would explain why I kept tasting metal even though I thought I got it lal out?
<drf|laptop> 03*all
<Kyu> 07that wasn't a gangster thing
<drf|laptop> 03I'm just scared to eat now
<drf|laptop> 03because chewing metal is like, really bad
<Kyu> 07that was what they used for fillings way before silver
<drf|laptop> 03LOL really
<drf|laptop> 03someone go tell Paul Wall then that he's out of date
<Kyu> 07in the foot-powered drills era lol
<Kyu> 07and does that guy really have a gold filling, or is it just a gold tooth
<Kyu> 07or a grill
<Kyu> 07XD
<drf|laptop> 03well the song is called Grillz so...
<drf|laptop> 03http://news.yahoo.com/oprah-winfrey-james-earl-jones-receive-oscars-055527610.html <- LOL wut
<drf|laptop> 03anyway Kyu once I brush my teeth and maybe use some mouthwash to rince my mouth out, I should be fine to eat like normal?
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, I don't eat the kind of food that's gonna get stuck in teeth LOL, save for maybe popcorn
<RainBroDash> 12New Dari Bot Post: 2722
<Polarfire> :P
<Aurora> drf
<Aurora> did I get Gameboid from you for my phone?
<Aurora> or did I somehow get that on my own
<Aurora> I can't remember
<drf|laptop> 03not sure
<drf|laptop> 03is it Gameboid Lite or the full one?
<Kyu> 07lol
<Kyu> 07speaking of popcorn I was just afk to make some
<Aurora> lite I think...
<Kyu> 07and yes you'll be fine, just avoid chewing with that tooth
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03and if it's Lite, you got it on your own
<drf|laptop> 03as that one's free
<drf|laptop> 03actually
<drf|laptop> 03they're all free now XD
<drf|laptop> 03but
<drf|laptop> 03they all got removed from the official Android market for some copyright crap

<Dman> on youtube comments i mean
<Skylands> 10As I never wake up this early
<Dusky> xDD
<Dusky> ohai Sky
<Dermathil> that's prolly because of the hippy age of the music
<Skylands> 10But since there's a loud thunderstorm :P
<Dman> : /
<Barry> How did you do that?
<Skylands> 10hey Dusky
<Dman> most modernsoncs are just repetitive and awful
<Dman> Barry - copy paste?
<Dman> from what i saw on youtube
<Barry> hmm
<Dman> Although Barry - there's a neat program called 'tenclips#
<Dman> you cycle through 10 clips with CTRL adn 1 - 0
<Dman> and you have TEN available clips
<Dman> so you can have 10 things copied
<Dman> and paste any given one
<Dman> so on my 1st clip i have 1▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ and on my second clip I have ＳＨＵＴ　ＵＰ　ＡＮＤ　ＥＮＪＯＹ　ＴＨＥ　ＭＵＳＩＣ！
<Dman> so i press CTRL 1 CTRL V then CTRL 2 CTRL V
<Dman> faster than selecting and copying the second part
<Dman> ^_^
<Dman> it's pretty neat =]

<Dman> (theyr rivalry i mean)
<eXAKR> And the train company still has the cheek to ask for fare increases
<Dermathil> I dropped naruto when I saw they made fillers again in shippuden.
<Barry> 223*
<Dman> of course! we all are bro
<Dman> Dermathil - ;__;
<Dermathil> dun' worry.
<Ascendant`> .-.
<Dman> barry what's up with recent eps?
<Dman> two week gap then double episode then two week gap?
<Dermathil> I had a website that basically linked every single episode.
<Barry> No, it's an episode a week
<Dman> i download now. to see in 720 p ^_^
<Ascendant`> Skylands
<Ascendant`> Want to go against my terrorist team?
<Dman> barry - recently
<Ascendant`> I finally found it
<Barry> And the animators got smarter with fillers
<Dman> there was a double
<Barry> instead of doing an 83 episode filler run
<Dman> and yes fillers are now win!
<Skylands> 10Sure
<Dman> july 28th - 'storage' and 'the five kage's desicion'
<Barry> They split them off between arcs when the anime gets closer to the manga than is safe
<Dman> double ep
<Ascendant`> :D
<Dman> suddenly, bronystate email
<Barry> Tmorrow should be a new episode
<Barry> and a new manga chapter
<Dman> Yush! but i don't read the manga
<Dman> no spoilers please >_<
<Barry> right
<Dman> have you seen the lost tower?
<Barry> Yep
<Dman> i swear i swear the 4th hokage guy naruto's father worked it it was his son!
<Dman> worked out *
<Dman> but they all memory wipe ;__;
<Barry> There's a particular scene in the manga that I'm not sure will get a pass into the anime
<Dman> is it spoilers?
<Dman> if not what is it?
<Dman> and why not? gory? too much?
<Barry> It's after Naruto and Bee enter Cloud
<Dman> enter cloud?
<Dman> so um not happened in anime yet
<Barry> Yeah
<Barry> but close
<Barry> might be a couple weeks
<Dman> is it spoilerific or would i be alright reading it to see why not?
<Barry> It's not spoilerific
<Dman> 'you will meet an octopus' why hasn't anyone worked it out in the hsow
<Dman> ok um do you have a link to it? I wanna see why it 'wouldn't pass into the anime'
<Barry> Alright.
<Dman> Thanks
<Dman> also up to where the anime is i mean, any major differences in manga and anime / missed out stuff?
<Dman> I'd LOVE to know
<Dman> only thing i know is that 'tales of a gutsy ninja' is a different ninja every time
<Dman> oh and best bit so far is when naruto says 'give up on me giving up' with the rasengan near the end of saving konoha
<Dman> with the 'heavenly ... somehting' song
<eXAKR> Anyone has the misfortune of having a train break down on your way TO work?
<Barry> http://www.mangafox.com/manga/naruto/v54/c513/15.html This is the scene I'm not sure will be put in as is
<Dman> how come? well i'll read it

<Espeon> 06I will be back shortly~~
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai
<Dermathil> guys, I got an Idea. I am putting the movie "The Game" on top of my B-movie selection list.
<Dman> Oh?
<Dman> trololo, and that, but is it good?
<Dman> mfw google says there's 4 films called 'the game'
<Dermathil> could be seen as a trolololol while being a real movie. It is interesting and slightly mind-screw, but not in the way you intend it to be.
<Dman> and 3 tv shows
<Dman> Which one?
<Dermathil> the 1997 movie the game.
<Dman> Ok gotcha
<Dermathil> with michael douglas and Sean Penn
<Dman> is that the one with a tv in a house?
<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBiMo5JvUqA&feature=player_embedded
<Dman> Best. Card trick. EVER.
<Dman> also very VERY recent
<Dman> wow.
<Dermathil> dman: there's more than just a tv in a house.
<Dman> dermathil - i've seen the first 10 odd minutes.. it looked good :P
<Dman> IS it good?
<Dermathil> yes
<Dermathil> it is a good thriller.
<Dman> sounds like a good b movie pick then!
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dman> i still don[t know what i'd pick
<Dermathil> (especially because of the name)
<Dman> (trololo)
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dman> (have you seen the magic trick?)
<Dermathil> watching it now
<Dermathil> and it is hilarious
<Dman> It is! :P
<Dermathil> and it is a pretty good trick.
<Dermathil> shows why he's the best card magister.
<Dman> How does he do it! >_<
<Dman> Eyup
<Dermathil> (he paid the guys at the factory to make another deck like that)
<Dman> (dat signature)
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Dman> but that's possible :P
<Dman> he did seem to put a card into the 'new deck' at some point
<Dman> but putting it in right order?
<Dermathil> he forgot he signed another 7 of diamond two weeks ago
<Dman> and dat seal
<Dman> hahaha
<Dman> i love magic, but can't do any myself
<Dermathil> same
<Dermathil> I usually like it to try to find the trick behind it.
<Dman> yes =]
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony

*Dermathil is pro-sniper.
*Dman calls an ambulance
<RainBroDash> With that in mind, I'm not at liberty to say much on the subject, so I'll shut up now
*Pegacorn stands back up
*Dman enters Pegacorn's room
<Dman> Where did you get shot?
<Pegacorn> The head.
<Dermathil> no problem. Though that means that since I've never been a mod before, I'll be in that much more harder.
<Dman> . . .
<Dman> Hmm. I've been a mod once before in a vidya livestream
<Pegacorn> But i'm ok
<Dman> like 4 odd years ago
<RainBroDash> Dermathil well obviously I wish you luck :P
<Dman> Pegacorn - are you a wizard?

<Dermathil> they actually thought you were a mule. That's why.
<Dermathil> They needed something to pull trucks with a dead motor.

<Pegacorn> In the words of Christian Bale,"KICK YER FUCKIN ASS!"

Before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time, and flung him into the future where my awesome is epic. Now the fool seeks to return to the past and undo the
<Dman> future that is Dman

<Glacymr> 12and i didn't hurt whatsoever
<Dermathil> Truman Show is a b-movie, right?
<Aurora> 6when did you have that done?
<Glacymr> 12heck, i didn't even take the pain medication the dentist prescribed to me
<prince-dari> I have no idea, I'd have to check.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Glacymr> 12hmmm i think around september of last year
<drf-Droid> Glacymr, this school has a whole poster about the chemistry of hot sauce
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Aurora> 6within the past couple years, I think the way wisdom teeth are removed has gotten better
<Aurora> 6I had mine done like 6 years ago
<ivanoni> 0:O:/hello
<Glacymr> 12ahh
<prince-dari> Hello.
<Glacymr> 12well
<Glacymr> 12being sedated i'm sure helped as well
<Glacymr> 12even if i did wake up in the middle of the operation x-x
<Aurora> 6no gas, needed numbing shots 5 separate times DURING the operation, and then slept 18 hours of the day while loaded up on vicadin and ibuprofin
<Aurora> 6only waking up to eat applesauce, drink water, and take my pennicilin pills
<Glacymr> 12i bled.... for an unbarable amount of time
<Aurora> 6oh lets not forget the pharmacy not getting my medicine on time like they said they would
<Aurora> 6and my novacain wore off a half hour before I got it
<Aurora> 6that was fun
<Glacymr> 12oww
<Aurora> 6ANYWAYS
<Glacymr> 12the only complication i had was bleeding for like 17 hours
<Aurora> 6what I learned is that it's possible to drink through a straw even if the straw is shoved so far back in your mouth it wont affect your teeth at all
<ivanoni> 0:):(:D:/:P::O;) mi nombre es ivan pppppppprrrrrrrr
<Aurora> 6since drinking through a straw creates a vacuum, which causes dry socket, I needed to find a way to not do that
<Aurora> 6:>
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6I also need to mention
<Aurora> 6I didn't have dissolvable stitches like people have now
<Aurora> 6mine needed to be removed like two weeks later
<Aurora> 6which was probably the most painful part
<Glacymr> 12ahh
<ivanoni> hello
<Glacymr> 12how was that like?
<Aurora> 6like shoving needles in between your tooth and gumline
<Aurora> 6several ties
<Aurora> 6times
<Glacymr> 12x-x
<ivanoni> 4:D
<Dman> You didn't tell me aobut almost famous dermathil :P
<drf-Droid> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Terrible ;.;]
<prince-dari> Mi nombre es Darius (Just copying the form, no idea if it's correct :P).
<Dman> /facepalm. Prince-dari, ivanoni is spamming, and paraspriting. I have told him (he's like 3 m away) about 5 times now to stop or i'll close his browser.
<Dman> his mum won't let me
<prince-dari> Meh, I', not bothered.
<prince-dari> I'm*
<prince-dari> It's not as though we're really doing anything here anyway.
<Dman> hhe's sat there giggling away cuz he said 'poo' earlier or something
<drf-Droid> well LL is getting hers removed in a few weeks, how long do you reckon it'll hurt?
<Dman> Yea luckily
<Glacymr> 12i think there is a reason why like half the channel here is birds
<Glacymr> 12they don't like the dentist so they give themselves beaks
*Glacymr hides
<Aurora> 6um
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Aurora> 6do you know if she's getting gassed?
<drf-Droid> no idea
<Glacymr> 12well
<Glacymr> 12like Aurora said
<Aurora> 6all 4 teeth?
<Aurora> 6or be like my friend and have all SIX
<Glacymr> 12apparently they improved the technology for that kind of operation in the last couple years
<Glacymr> 12so it shouldn't be like Aurora's experience
<ivanoni> 0ce
<Glacymr> 12unless the dentist uses a mac or windows me
<Aurora> 6it'll most likely still hurt
<Aurora> 6but it also depends on how the teeth are
<Dman> *_* wow. my dad said if i want to stay here to chat he doesn't mind going out on his own :P yay. It's so awesome. I mean, wow. i mean, having a parent being this nice. wow i'm so happy right now
<Aurora> 6mine were deeper than most, and pretty impacted
<Dman> i still will leave though
<Dman> to help ; )
<Dman> as I said, i'm leaving in about 2 hours and will be back at around 11ish
<drf-Droid> dunno, I'll ask her later
<Dman> (uktime)
<Dermathil> Dman: do you know that movie, Dman?
<Dman> I don't :P
<Dermathil> (I was putting my stuff in the washing machine)
<Glacymr> 12like i said, i had 5 removed, and it didn't hurt one bit, i didn't even take the pain medication prescribed to me. not to mention they were impacted as well
<Dman> >musical comedy-drama. huh
<Aurora> 6they probably wont be that bad, my experience was set up just right to be pretty horrible
<Pegacorn> Sorry,i dun derped.
<Dermathil> Almost Famous is an oscar-winner.
<Dermathil> Based on a true story
<Dman> made back only 80% of budget D:
<Dman> feelsbaddirector
<Dermathil> That movie was good
<ivanoni> 0te odio prince dari
<Dman> looks good
<Glacymr> 12i was bleeding so badly though x-x
<Dermathil> It is based off the real life of a guy who made critics of multiple big bands. He went on tour with Aerosmith for example
<Dman> OH FFUUUUU THAT'S IT IM KICKING IVANONI IN REAL LIFE
<Aurora> 6yeah I was too
<Aurora> 6for a while
<Dman> BRB GUYS GOT TO WALK ACROSS THE ROOM AND CLOSE AN 8 Y/O'S BROWSER >8^(
<Aurora> 6dunno why yours was so bad though
<Glacymr> 12dunno
<Glacymr> 12i went back to the dentist
<Dermathil> did ivanoni call prince-dari an idiot?
<Pegacorn> ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH.
<Glacymr> 12because i was starting to gag trying to replace the cloth
<Glacymr> 12and they said it was normal bleeding
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Aurora> 6normal yeah
<Dman> RIGHT YEA!
<Aurora> 6but that long after isn't
<Dman> their parents are looking at my laptop and seeing what he wrote bfore
<Dman> Yes Dermathil
<Aurora> 6blood clots pretty quickly
<Dman> lol
<Aurora> 6so unless you were prodding it and stuff
<Aurora> 6it should have stopped bleeding like that
<Glacymr> 12not really
<Glacymr> 12i was too afraid to even go anywhere near those areas XD
<Aurora> 6exactly
<Glacymr> 12what can i say
<Glacymr> 12some people are just bleeders
<Dman> EPIC
<Glacymr> 12and some people you start to question if they even do have blood
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Aurora> 6LOL
*Dermathil listens to row row fight the power
<Aurora> 6that's me to a point
<Dman> i mean, my dad just said 'do whatever the hell you want tonight, and **** your mother if she says otherwise, you're 17 years old you need to learn about life, make mistakes, and live.'

<drf-Droid> well
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew open office :p
<Sathi> Running on coffee atm
<Sathi> lost the time, while reading a fanfic
<HyperMetalLugia> Just use the CLOUD

<Dman> Dermathil - do you have any other B movie choices? :3
<drf-Droid> EW THE CLOUD
<Dman> Oh oh oh i love fanfics! which one?
<Pegacorn> Runnin' in the coffee.

<drf-Droid> of course they were made in Office
<Sathi> Blue Skies Ahead

<Dermathil> also, maybe the french movie "The Chorus" from 2004. I remember that movie being good.
<Glacymr> 12well
<Dman> Ok haven't read that one
<Glacymr> 12they could have been made in microsoft word
<Dman> Don't know The Chorus, i'm afraid, Dermathil
<Glacymr> 12then opened by openoffice
<Dermathil> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372824/
<drf-Droid> that's what I said
<drf-Droid> and openoffice ruined it
<drf-Droid> LOL
<prince-dari> Oh. That film.
<Glacymr> 12[11:43:14] <drf-Droid> of course they were made in Office
<Glacymr> 12[
<Glacymr> 12you have just blown my mind

<Dman> b movie idea?
<RainBroDash> 10They're both sick films
<prince-dari> I've seen the second one RainBro.
<Dermathil> Dashite gave me the original idea for that.
<RainBroDash> 10Dari, did you like it?
<Dermathil> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479647/
<Ziltoid> The Re-animator is the best Bmovie of all time
<Dman> oooo 1985 :P
<Dermathil> Dashite once asked me how I'd react to him putting that very movie if he won
<Dermathil> I said I'd laugh my ass off.
<Dman> lol
<RainBroDash> 10:P
<Dermathil> but he caused this idea to be "incepted" in my brainz
<Dman> was it dashite that wanted CUBE really badly?
<Dman> or you dermathil?
<Dermathil> that was me, Dman.
<Dman> both D names I get confused sorry about that
<Dermathil> I'm the Sci-fi junkie.

<Pattyrick> And hi Nickstr
<ValtheJean> well then yes, I'd be Gar for Caramel
<Dman> http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gar
<Dman> Lol well said
<Dman> Gar as an adjective refers to a man who is so incredibly badass and hardcore, his mere presence turns all lesser men into timid, swooning homophiles. Supposedly derived from a misspelling of gay, it was first used by an Anonymous on 4chan’s /a/ board to describe the epic feats of Archer, one of the main characters in the anime Fate/stay night. Trying to say,
<Dman> I’m Gay for Archer”, he said “I’m Gar for Archer” and the meme took off like a rocket.
<ValtheJean> lol
<Sathi> 7Archer?
<Sathi> 7the series?
<Dman> some anime character
<Pattyrick> If the cake is the lie, does that make a Klondike Bar worth saving?

<ValtheJean> @Nittany_Tiger eh....well...honestly it's best not to dwell on that stuff
*Dermathil is watching a commentary of Crysis 2 singleplayer, which he bought before it was pulled from Steam. He wasn't so lucky with Dragon Age 2 though...
<prince-dari> Why are console games always bigger than PC games. O_o
<Dman> GUYS my dad 'hmm this isn't that bad' JUST NOW
<Nittany_Tiger> I wasn't being serious.
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03other way around
<ValtheJean> ...fuck
<Dman> dermathil feels bad man : /
<drfsupercenter> 03I said Steam, Steam = PC
<prince-dari> Lolno.
<Nittany_Tiger> If something bad did happen I'm sorry for that.
<drfsupercenter> 03Xbox 360 games have a limit of about 6GB.
<prince-dari> PS3 games are usually 30GB+
<NewDCD> 9Well guys I sent Seth my fic update
<drfsupercenter> 03that's because Sony puts rootkits in their software :D
<prince-dari> Fair enough.
<prince-dari> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03also, the few PS3 games I've ripped
<Dman> =D
<drfsupercenter> 03were like 6-7GB.
<Dman> w00t
<NewDCD> 9that chapter took forever to write
<drfsupercenter> 03the rest is just a bunch of filler data
<drfsupercenter> 03that doesn't actually do anything
<ValtheJean> it's all good. I've moved passed it, so there's no worries. You didn't know :P
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Dermathil> I hate EA just a bit more for removing their games off steam. They just climbed back up to Activision-levels of evil.
<NewDCD> 9because lot of exposition plus fight scene
*Nittany_Tiger hopes the following gaming publishers die within two years: EA, Actiivision, and Ubisoft.
<Dman> sounds like a fun read incoming :P
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: WHAT YOU SAY?
<NewDCD> 9But Nittany, every once in a while Ubisoft does a real bro-move
<NewDCD> 9like brining Senko no Ronde to the States
<NewDCD> 9and No More Heroes 1
<NewDCD> 9their manual stuff is bullshit tho
<prince-dari> I dunno then.
<NewDCD> 9but seriously
<NewDCD> 9EA removing its games from Steam?
<Sathi> 7yep
<Dman> eyup
<NewDCD> 9what about the people that own shit like Dead Space already?
<Sathi> 7screwed
<Sathi> 7:)
<Dermathil> DCD: EA just went back up to activisions level of evil. They removed Dragon Age 2 and Crysis 2 from Steam because of Origins.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft: "So I herd you liek pirating, so we put draconian DRM in ur game so we can watch you pirate while you pirate every second you pirate."
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: Explain that shit for me, please
<Nittany_Tiger> Real bro move there >.>
<NewDCD> 9Nittany: I meant for console games
<ValtheJean> DCD...how could you...
<ValtheJean> HOW COULD YOU????
<Dman> lul
<Dermathil> http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2011/07/28/dragon-age-2-removed-from-steam-ea-blames-restrictive-terms/
<Dermathil> DCD, check this out.
<prince-dari> Are you /still/ talking about Caramel? :P
<Dman> Always
<Nittany_Tiger> Console gamers are lucky. They only have to put up with publisher greed. Draconian DRM hasn't come full-on yet.
*ValtheJean cannot unfeel the wounds caused by the infinite pain of this atrocity
<NewDCD> 9well, doing anything like that on Steam will hurt EA on the long run.
<NewDCD> 9because I'm pretty sure Valve will not want
<NewDCD> 9to publish their games via them anymore
<Dermathil> Nittany_Tiger: don't say too bad of Ubisoft. The montreal branch is awesome and is 3 hours away from where I live.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft created the worst DRM in history.
<Dermathil> which is?
<Nittany_Tiger> Always-on.
<Nittany_Tiger> Forcing you to be connected to the internet to play SP games.
<Dman> lol well said
<Dermathil> what games?
<prince-dari> What about Sony's rootkit DRM?
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> lol, that's nothing compared to what Capcom's going to do
<Sathi> 7why no-one seeds my download :(
<prince-dari> IMO that's the worst ever.
<Nittany_Tiger> Assassin's Creed 2 onward to I forget.
<Sathi> 7waiting time a week...
<Dman> what is it sathi? L4D2 maps?
<ValtheJean> did you hear about the new DMC copy-right protection?
<Sathi> 7nah
<Sathi> 7Alestorm
<prince-dari> Alestorm!
<Nittany_Tiger> What is Capcom going to do?
<Dman> : /
<NewDCD> 9yeah, holy shit Ubisoft Montreal is love.
<Dman> sorry to hear it
<ValtheJean> basically
<Nittany_Tiger> Worse than Always-on?
<NewDCD> 9also Capcom is shittier than all the other companies right now
<ValtheJean> they're making save games impossible to remove
<NewDCD> 9we're kind of
<NewDCD> 9oh that
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft is stupid.
<ValtheJean> yeah
<NewDCD> 9wait vAL
<prince-dari> Nittany_Tiger: Yes. A. God. Damn. Rootkit.
<NewDCD> 9seriously?
<ValtheJean> not fucking kidding
<Nittany_Tiger> That's Sony.
<NewDCD> 9I thought after what happened The Mercenaries 3D
<prince-dari> I know, that's what I was talking about.
<NewDCD> 9they said they wouldn't do it again
<Nittany_Tiger> Creaters of SecuROM.
<NewDCD> 9because it caused a serious shitstorm
<ValtheJean> >implying Capcom stays true to its word
<NewDCD> 9well, yeah
<NewDCD> 9but
<Pegacorn> Sony:They don't give a fuck about the community.Or do they?
<NewDCD> 9after what happened last time
<Nittany_Tiger> Capcom uses always-on DRM on PS3 downloadable titles.
<NewDCD> 9they have to be PANTS-ON-HEAD RETARDED To do it again...then again...when haven't they
<Nittany_Tiger> Pegacorn: they're too rich to give a fuck about you.
<ValtheJean> Capcom realized a long time ago their fanboys are so rediculous they can cause ANY shitstorm and get away with it
<Nittany_Tiger> Like Activision can.
<Dman> ...and then I paused to show my family Derpy
<ValtheJean> ung....Activision
<ValtheJean> ruined Blizzard
<NewDCD> 9Activision is a dick
<NewDCD> 9I wish Infinity Ward didn't belong to them
<Nittany_Tiger> Activision can request that everyone that buys MW3 give them their deeds to their house, and they'll still break sales records.
<Dman> : / true
<Nittany_Tiger> They're already going to charge monthly fees for stats and extra maps.
<ValtheJean> here's to hoping Valve remains uncorrupted... OH WAIT
<Pegacorn> Indeed.They don't care about ANYPONY.
<Pegacorn> Sony that is.
<Nittany_Tiger> Sadly, some people think it's ok for Activision to be greedy because they're not being like EA or Ubisoft.
<ValtheJean> man...if I weren't at work I'd blow off some serious frustration in HL2: DM
<NewDCD> 9we can all agree that the current vidja industry just have companies that suck less than others, right?
<NewDCD> 9*has
<Nittany_Tiger> The current industry has a horrible greed problem and needs to crash.
<ValtheJean> pretty much
<NewDCD> 9also Val what did you mean with corrupted Valve?
<NewDCD> 9I did not hear about this
<NewDCD> 9well Nittany
<ValtheJean> *cough* TF2 *cough*
<NewDCD> 9it's a business
<NewDCD> 9making more money is just
<NewDCD> 9the way it rolls
<NewDCD> 9Val: Idungeddit. Mad about the fact it went F2P?
<NewDCD> 9Or the hat bs?
<ValtheJean> the problem is not in the companies, but people's stupidity to keep buying their shit
<ValtheJean> lol, I quit that game *way* before the hats
<Pegacorn> VALTHEJEAN,DON'T TALK SHIT ABOUT TF2!
<ValtheJean> it was a perfectly balanced and refined game
<Nittany_Tiger> And that's when Activision becomes ok for being themselves. Because they're just making money.
<ValtheJean> and they ran it into the ground
<Nittany_Tiger> Do you want a gaming industry full of Activision-like publishers?
<NewDCD> 9*shrug* aren't we already on that situation?
<ValtheJean> Activision's actions are justified by the fact people keep BUYING activision products
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<ValtheJean> if people stopped being mindless sheep, they'd have no marketting power
<Nittany_Tiger> Exactly.
<NewDCD> 9which is why I seriously went "wat" on Capcom's actions lately. That sort of shit has BOUND to lose them clients...or at least so I thought
<Nittany_Tiger> Which is?
<ValtheJean> lol, never underestimate the streefighter/dmc fanbase
<ValtheJean> they will keep Capcom going forever
<NewDCD> 9I like to call it the "Week of Terror"
<NewDCD> 9>dmc
<NewDCD> 9I thought the fanbase was still furious about that?
<ValtheJean> well, I know I am
<Nittany_Tiger> How is Capcom going to screw gamers over?
<ValtheJean> but, let's be honest
<DeniedExistence> @NewDCD Can you give me SirSprinkle's Skype? We may need him on TheBronyShow next episode.
<ValtheJean> they're going to bitch about it until the game comes out
<Dermathil> how's the viewing Dman?
<ValtheJean> but no matter how shitty it is
<NewDCD> 9Existence: yeah, I got him
<ValtheJean> they'll buy it
<NewDCD> 9give me a sec
<Nittany_Tiger> NewDCD: What happened?
<ValtheJean> just like the L4D2 boycott
<Dman> dermathil - good thanks. part 1 finished
<Pegacorn> OHAI DENIEDEXISTENCE.
<Nittany_Tiger> MW2 boycott is a better example.
<Dman> but it's late dermathil, so we now wathcing inecption as that was the plan
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Nittany_Tiger> Valve actually met with the gamers to show them the game.
<NewDCD> 9but Val, the boycott was taken down because the reasons to make a new sequel WERE justified.
<Dman> (inception in spanish)
<Quanyails> 7When'll Feather be back, anyone know?
<Nittany_Tiger> Activision just let sheeplism take the boycott away.
<ValtheJean> well, my point was that they still bought the game
<DeniedExistence> OHAI PEGACORN
<NewDCD> 9and at least Valve took the trouble to explain why they were making a boycott, and actually made DLC for L4D1 as they said
<ValtheJean> and disregarded everything they conplained about
<NewDCD> 9unlike, you know, Capcom
<NewDCD> 9OBJECTION!
<Pegacorn> ......KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
<NewDCD> 9That's the thing
<Nittany_Tiger> What did Capcom do?
<DeniedExistence> @NewDCD My Skype is Denied_Existence
<NightSeas> 12In 9000 years
<NewDCD> 9they were complaining about something that was soon addressed
*NightSeas runs
<ValtheJean> I think I may have mispoke
<Dman> Capcop want all our mines. GOTCHA!
<NewDCD> 9when there were no more reasons to complain, it is illogical to continue a boycott
<ValtheJean> the features that (are now) implemented into L4D1 didn't appear at the same time as L4D2 (it happened shortly after, yes)
<ValtheJean> my problem:
<NewDCD> 9Nittany: There's a freaking chart somewhere around here, let me find him
<ValtheJean> was seeing the group the day L4D2 was released
<Barry> Hello
<ValtheJean> and every fucking person was playing it
<ValtheJean> howdy Barry
<NewDCD> 9Objection, Val
<ValtheJean> lol, yes Pheonix?
<NewDCD> 9allow me
<drfsupercenter> 03she's supposedly on Steam right now
<NewDCD> 9to present my evidence
<Barry> Well, I'd have to say that Dr. Who is a pretty good sci-fi show
<NewDCD> 9http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead_2#Boycott
<NewDCD> 9also, Nittany
<Pegacorn> EXPLOSION.
<HyperMetalLugia> Feather will not return
<HyperMetalLugia> Until TF2 is dead :P
<drfsupercenter> 03so HML
<drfsupercenter> 03AMD is epic sometimes
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah?
<drfsupercenter> 03they gave me TWO game codes
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03for the same game
<HyperMetalLugia> Amazing :P
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm looking to give one away
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the GPU itself had one in the box
<Pegacorn> HOLD IT!
<drfsupercenter> 03and then NewEgg sent me one as a "free gift"
<drfsupercenter> 03so I have two LOL
<Dman> TAKE THAT!
<drfsupercenter> 03It's the game DIRT3, for anyone who likes racing games.
<ValtheJean> ""for people who joined the Boycott Group on Steam ... they're actually pre-ordering the product at a higher rate than Left 4 Dead 1 owners who weren't in the Boycott"
<Barry> what's going on
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't have Steam :P
<HyperMetalLugia> So sorry :<
<drfsupercenter> 03Good
<drfsupercenter> 03Steam sucks
<NewDCD> 9Nittany: http://i.imgur.com/yYw7w.jpg
<ValtheJean> I'm not saying the boycott was justified
<ValtheJean> I'm saying that the "boycott" was a farce in of itself
<HyperMetalLugia> And people still use it
<ValtheJean> because at the end of the day, fanboys are fanboys
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder what that reminds me of
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Dman> newdcd - haha seen that bfore :P
<ValtheJean> hurray! I killed chat!
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I use it, unfortunately
<Dman> lul
<drfsupercenter> 03but really only to prod people who won't use IRC *cough*Feather*cough*
<drfsupercenter> 03and redeeming lots of free games I have no intent to play
<drfsupercenter> 03speaking of which, Quanyails, VVVVVV is part of the Humble Indie Bundle 3, if you want to own it legally.
<drfsupercenter> 03you can pay as much or as little as you want for like 10 games total
<Barry> I wonder
<ValtheJean> in order to spike conversation
<ValtheJean> YOU OWE ME SOCK PUPPETS NEWDCD
<Barry> @eccentricmeter The Doctor
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The Doctor is 49% eccentric. (965)
<NewDCD> 9PROTESTO!
<Barry> ok
<Dman> Lool
<NewDCD> 9It was not necessarily a farce!
<Dman> TOMA YA!
<Dman> UN MOMENTO!
<NewDCD> 9after all
<Dman> : D
<DeniedExistence> Can anyone suggest a good PMV or otherwise to play on the next episode of TheBronyShow?
<Dman> >has played in spanish bfore
<NewDCD> 9the reason the boycott was shut down was due to that "event"
<Dman> deniedexistence - the trailer of forrest gump is awesome
<NewDCD> 9upon seeing that Valve was fulfilling their promise...was there a reason NOT to pre-order?
<DeniedExistence> Link?
<Dman> sure bro
<DeniedExistence> Is it pony related?
<NewDCD> 9also
<ValtheJean> well, the problem is that the issues weren't just content related
<NewDCD> 9Denied
<NewDCD> 9add me
<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfqJR-Aso1U
<NewDCD> 9time-diver
<NewDCD> 9brb
<DeniedExistence> Your Skype name is what?
<ValtheJean> but nontheless, it's a pointless argument
<Dman> welp deniedexistence if ya don't like it that's fine
<Dman> also, sorry i can't look thru my pmvs rite now
<work> 03o.o
<Dman> i'm watching inception
<Sathi> 7but but.
<Ziltoid> Skype?
<Sathi> 7you should wait!
<Sathi> 7till the show
<Sathi> 7:(
<Dman> sathi - 2 weeks ago my dad wanted to watch
<Dman> sowwee
<Dman> coincidence
<Pegacorn> What show?
<Dman> besides it's in spanish so it's not as good :P
<Ziltoid> Its ok dman
<Nittany_Tiger> NewDCD: (After reading image) Just like other current gaming publishers. Treat the customers like shit. Just like EA and Sony treats customers like shit. Just like Activision treats customers like cash machines.
<Dman> pegacorn - movie night!
<Ziltoid> youre gonna have to watch it again to fully understand it I think
<ValtheJean> everyone is chatting on skype except me :(
<Dman> However it IS on a nice and big projector ; )
<Dermathil> except steam considers their customers way better.
<Pegacorn> Movie night is tonight?
<Dermathil> Look up Alien Swarm.
<Dman> ziltoid - yfw i have it on bluray seen it 10 odd times
<Dermathil> A full game given away for free.
<Dman> dermathil - it was meh
<Ziltoid> lolwut
<Dermathil> Then, TF2 goes free.
<Link> !espeon !sneas !umbreon
*work now belongs to Link for 30 minutes
*Espeon now belongs to Link for 10 minutes
*Umbreon now belongs to Link for 12 minutes
<Dman> but judge yourself : P
<Ziltoid> Ive only wacthed it once
<Dermathil> Dman, I loved that game. It was given for free so the community would provide support for the game. They also threw the source code out.
<ValtheJean> yeah, TF2 goes free after they realized what a trainwreck it was :P
<FlutterHiAtWork> hey guys
<Ziltoid> hai
<ValtheJean> howdy Flutterhi
<Dman> sup flutterhi!
<Dman> ...at work :D
<FlutterHiAtWork> yep :)
<Dman> hey flutterhi - prince-dari's gonna make another puzzle!
<ValtheJean> what is this madness? O_o
<Barry> Hi FlutterHi
<FlutterHiAtWork> I'm at my sys admin job
<ValtheJean> @dman my brain...it is not ready
<Nittany_Tiger> Valve has faults, but compared to other gaming publishers on the PC front, they're saints.
<Dman> valthejean for what? oh the puzzle :P
<FlutterHiAtWork> fixing webforms... and chatting with my bronies <3
<ValtheJean> :P
<Nittany_Tiger> They actually /care/ about gamers.
<Dermathil> ValtheJean, TF2 was never a trainwreck.
<Dermathil> Its been supported for 4 years now.
<Nittany_Tiger> And are profiting.
<Dman> valthejean - when i have time i'll show you the ponychan i saved it but gotta upload it somewhere to show ya
<Dman> it 404d
<Dermathil> That's more than most games out there.
<FlutterHiAtWork> it's more like a storage house full of stupid hats
<ValtheJean> @Support =/= quality
<Dman> >tf2 >trainwreck. what am i reading?
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil*
<FlutterHiAtWork> that was built ontop of traintracks
<ValtheJean> Duke Nukem is getting DLC, which is technically support
<Barry> I'm lost
<ValtheJean> and frankly, that is one atomic bomb sized wreck
<Dman> Portal is getting free console dlc - unheard of. thank ya kindly, valve :D
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: Duke nukem won't even have support a year from now.
<DeniedExistence> @NewDCD, what did you say your Skype was?
<FlutterHiAtWork> tf2 is a storage house full of hats with several trains who are going to collide with it
<Nittany_Tiger> Even the 360 version?
<Dman> deniedexistece i have it if ya want
<Dman> nittany eyup ! :D
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil I could only hope so
<NightSeas> 12What's your steam name drf?
<Nittany_Tiger> I thought Microsoft forced fees on DLC>
<FlutterHiAtWork> but they have MLP maps
<Dman> that's y valve is awesum
<Dermathil> @FlutterHiAtWork: meh, that's what happens when someone never saw what the original game looked like.
<ValtheJean> but nontheless, it still stands that supporting a game does not make it quality
<HyperMetalLugia> It isn't Drfsupercenter
<Pattyrick> Back xD
<ValtheJean> and to be fair
<Nittany_Tiger> That's why Valve didn't originally release free DLC on the 360 while releasing the same DLC free on the PC.
<DeniedExistence> @Dman Well don't just sit there! Hand me it!
<Dman> i suppose so
<NightSeas> 12If you don't mind me asking
<Dman> lolk
<ValtheJean> TF2 vanilla was great
<NightSeas> 12Oh, lol
<Barry> Look, let's all agree to disagree here
<Nittany_Tiger> I hated TF2 originally. No instruction manual. No tutorial. Just get raped learning how to play.
<ValtheJean> I DISAGREE WITH YOUR ATTEMPTS TO AGREE TO DISAGREE
<Dermathil> In comparison to the bare stuff the original game had (which was the basic loadout and 8 maps in total), Steam added 20+ new maps, TONS of new weapons, and ways to make you more recogniseable.
<FlutterHiAtWork> when i tf2 i just feal like I'm playing counterstrike but I'm actually good
<FlutterHiAtWork> where's the fun in that
<Dman> deniedexistence - he goes by 'D' but can't see where his email is
<ValtheJean> @Nittany_Tiger hah, clearly you never played DM
<DeniedExistence> Wait...what?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm bad at MP shooters in general.
<DeniedExistence> Give me his EXACT Skype account
<Dman> how do i view profiles >_<
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil and it's those weapons and changes that MADE TF2 a trainwreck
<FlutterHiAtWork> I'll stick to unreal tourney. Halo CE and CSS
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm one of the rare people that dislike Battlefield. I hate BF games because they're too hard.
<Nittany_Tiger> And now they're catching elitism syndrome.
<FlutterHiAtWork> I hate battlefields because fuck realism
<ValtheJean> well, that will happen with any game
<NightSeas> 12Yay now I know where everyone on steam is :D
*NightSeas runs
<ValtheJean> any online game is going to have elitists
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: not really. If you disagree with these weapons, then I won't stop you. But I find that the tons of new weapons give alot more variability in the playstyles.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Dermathil> You don't play a sniper with a jarate the same way you play a sniper with the normal smg, for example.
<FlutterHiAtWork> I'd much rather shoot a gun that looks like an alien penis and launches an inordinat amount of ammo
<Quanyails> 7And DRF; yes, I've noticed.
<Ray> 02I'm a shadow dudeeee </reference>, you can't find me
<Quanyails> 7*late*
<Nittany_Tiger> But I feel like a dead weight more than BF games than in any other game.
<Quanyails> 7It's version 2.0, too! D:
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil fair enough. I'll agree that we have a difference of opinion
<Nittany_Tiger> Which basically makes everything hard to do.
<FlutterHiAtWork> I have a friend playing BF3 alpha
<Quanyails> 7But I don't want 10 entire games, lol. XD
<NightSeas> 12k, I'll add you if you don't mind Ray XD
<Quanyails> 7Maybe when the promotion is over and it's updated on Steam. o.o
<ValtheJean> sigh...now I miss HL2: DM
<FlutterHiAtWork> it sure is a pretty game
<drfsupercenter> 03<NightSeas> What's your steam name drf? <- take a wild guess
<ValtheJean> who wants to watch some frag vids, ey?
<Espeon> 06lol
<FlutterHiAtWork> yessss
<ValtheJean> make this old timer remember the glory days :P
<drfsupercenter> 03and Quanyails, um, you can just pay like $10 and get the 10 games even if you aren't going to use all 10 :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I buy them just because I support the program'
<FlutterHiAtWork> God i misss when UT was THE SHIT
<drfsupercenter> 03and I pay more than $1 :P
<Quanyails> 7I know. o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03I meant $1, btw, not 10
<Dman> ah deniedexistence - skype name 'Time-diver'
<Nittany_Tiger> I like MP games like RTCW and UT2K4, which I enjoyed.
<Dman> name 'D'
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: alright then. I do hate often on the spy silent knife, but I understand that you can counter it if you're careful enough.
<Quanyails> 7Well, it is a good deal. :P
<Dman> got that deniedexistence?
<Quanyails> 7Windosill, being the toy it is, was $3. :P
<Nittany_Tiger> No unbalancing unlocks. No KDR. Just the game with awesome modes.
<Quanyails> 7I should pay more for 10 games, though. O_o
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil lol...don't even get me started on how useless the backguard was
<FlutterHiAtWork> you know what new game I loved
<Dman> what?
<FlutterHiAtWork> Section 8 prejudice
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: I know. The shield was shit. But it was a good concept
<DeniedExistence> Thanks
<Dman> =]
<ValtheJean> for anyone who cares
<FlutterHiAtWork> that game is fucking brillian
<ValtheJean> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99_ziM7mT7I
<ValtheJean> that is what I will be watching for nostalgia :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't found my footing in MP shooters since I stopped playing UT2K4.
<Dman> valthejean hurray you fond it!
<Dermathil> If it could've regenerated after a while, like 30 or 60 seconds, instead of needing to go back to spawn to get a new one
<Dman> found *
<Nittany_Tiger> And I can't get footing in BF games.
<Sathi> 7Val?
<ValtheJean> well, that's ONE of em
<ValtheJean> yeah?
<Quanyails> 7Can I actually pay, like, $0.01? >>
<Dman> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why they let you pick
<Sathi> 7how long left on your workday?
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep LOL
<ValtheJean> :(
<drfsupercenter> 03though they guilt-trip you if you pay less than $1
<drfsupercenter> 03I paid $6.66, because who doesn't like that number
<ValtheJean> about 2 1/2 hours
<Dman> well how long?
<Dman> oh
<Dman> not too bad
<FlutterHiAtWork> ? I work for another hour
<drfsupercenter> 03(And at the time, there were only 5 games - the older ones were just added today)
<Dman> got any interesting jobs rite now?
<Dman> yay~
<Quanyails> 7Weeeell...
<Quanyails> 7Here's the thing:
<ValtheJean> well, I'm currently converting a chainsaw from poly to NURBS
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: I though find that all the weapons have a good concept behind them.
<ValtheJean> and now bringing it into inventor
<Dman> lol
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil I can see that. They did have some good ideas
<FlutterHiAtWork> can we get a brony halo CE game going?
<Dman> YES
<Dman> later thou
<Dman> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL, HyperMetalLugia, the AMD GPU is bigger than my motherboard.
<FlutterHiAtWork> yeah
<ValtheJean> my issue was that they upset the refined balance of the game
<FlutterHiAtWork> :)
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's a full sized motherboard too
*Nittany_Tiger doesn't have a copy of that game.
<HyperMetalLugia> Really O>o
<HyperMetalLugia> Wat
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<drfsupercenter> 03want a picture
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Dman> aww
<ValtheJean> ^
<FlutterHiAtWork> I can upload a copy
<HyperMetalLugia> Sure
<Quanyails> 7I got into the PPPPPP Remix Album (VVVVVV soundtrack) by contacting VVVVVV's music writer after a message he left on a pirating site asking to e-mail him unreleased music. o.o
<Dman> w00t doo eet
<FlutterHiAtWork> that's portable and shit
<Nittany_Tiger> I'd have to steal one.
<Quanyails> 7Well, that's the truncated version.
<ValtheJean> hey, I'd happily play DM with you guys :P
<FlutterHiAtWork> will do
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm 99% pushed to piracy anyway by gaming publisher bullshit.
<drfsupercenter> 03http://files.humblebundle.com/VVVVVV_2.0_Win3.exe?key=7yfmdvMSszzh&ttl=1312497118&t=1dc69afb6ba9dca24ea581f6318db273
<drfsupercenter> 03you could also just use that
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03that's my paid-key
<Dman> flutterhiatwork please do ^_^
<Quanyails> 7o.O?
<drfsupercenter> 03but it has no DRM so yeah
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: I personally prefered the weapons that were a sidegrade (not an upgrade but a weapons that is as good but that fits a different play-style like the bow) instead of the upgrades.
<Quanyails> 7Oh, LOOK.
<drfsupercenter> 03You don't HAVE to use them in STeam.
<drfsupercenter> 03They also come with stand-alone versions.
<Pattyrick> My PC won't accept the software for my HP Officejet 6500 printer because it runs Win 7 and now Vista or XP D=
<drfsupercenter> 03I just copied the link from MY purchase
<Quanyails> 7http://www.souleye.se/ <-- Yes! The Humble Indie Bundle features VVVVVV and four other cool titles! Now you can get them all for as little as ONE PENNY.
<Dermathil> @piratemeter Dermathil
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Dermathil is 51% pirate. (966)
<FlutterHiAtWork> I'll upload later when I get out of work
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Dman> :P
<Dermathil> I AM A PIRATE
<Dman> @piratemeter Dman
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Dman is 71% pirate. (967)
<FlutterHiAtWork> =]
<Dman> lul
*Dermathil starts to sing the song.
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil understandable. My issue with the bow was that it enabled the sniper to be a front lines soldier
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<Quanyails> 7I'd actually like them on Steam, DRF. :P
<Sathi> 7that you are
<Ziltoid> @freemeter dman
<Steven_Magnet> 6 dman is 45% free. (968)
<drfsupercenter> 03it comes with a key that lets you play Minecraft for free
<Nittany_Tiger> Do what you want because a pirate is free!
<drfsupercenter> 03until August 14 anyway
*Dman does what he wants cuz a pirate is free. He is a pirate ~~~
<drfsupercenter> 03I refuse to get hooked on that sillyness, but LOL free Minecraft
<Quanyails> 7Nah.
<Dman> xP
<DeniedExistence> @Dman Do you know what sir sprinkle's Skype is?
<Quanyails> 7But anyway, that key:
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: well, that was the reason they made that set of stuff originally. Make the Sniper more front-lines.
<Dman> sorry deniedexistence, no
<Nittany_Tiger> Free of DRM. Free of online passes.
<Quanyails> 7Actually:
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/z4yEw.jpg <- ignore the "ew" LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03and uh
<drfsupercenter> 03rotate it o.o
<Dman> ask newdcd for sirsprinkles' skype
<drfsupercenter> 03Quanyails that's the standalone version.
<Quanyails> 7I'd actually rather pay SOMETHING for the games. o.o
<DeniedExistence> Ok, New is from panama right?
<drfsupercenter> 03if you want it in Steam you'd have to buy it yourself
<Dermathil> similarly, the scout update went from making him an objective runner to a hit-and-run assassination style with high "burst" damage.
<drfsupercenter> 03since I already redeemed my Steam keys
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<HyperMetalLugia> Where is the ew? :P
<drfsupercenter> 03in the image URL
<ValtheJean> I just dislike those changes a lot
<HyperMetalLugia> hahaha
<ValtheJean> it screws with high end play
<drfsupercenter> 03also LOL "Unleash your 6950 and it'll unleash you" <- that sounds... bad x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> But wow
*Nittany_Tiger thinks he should hold off of playing TF2 online until he unlocks more weapons during practice matches.
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds kinky?
<Dman> yes he is deniedexistence
*HyperMetalLugia mauled
<FlutterHiAtWork> It also fucks with popularity
<FlutterHiAtWork> and sales
<Dermathil> The Kritzkrieg was also a good morale killer (you don't wanna run toward a 100%-critting heavy) while the uber made the target a sponge.
<Dman> ;__; can't run TF2 even though downloaded
<Dermathil> What I find ValtheJean is that the changes were made to fit different play-styles.
<Dman> i love the 'meet the' though
<HyperMetalLugia> !ew FAT16
<drfsupercenter> 13EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW FAT16
<ValtheJean> eh, honestly if they wanted such different playstyles they should have made a different game
<ValtheJean> which they basically did
<nickstr> some still have to use it
<nickstr> for older operating systems
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't mind it
<Dman> FUUCK
<Dermathil> I never liked the basic demoman. I prefer demoknight with the shield, caber and lochnload, for example.
<Dman> IM FUCKING OFF TO READ
<Dman> BEST FANFIC
<DeniedExistence> ...?

<DeniedExistence> I see...
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil, did you ever learn sticky-hoping? or have they removed that since then?
<FlutterHiAtWork> this song has been glued to my brain
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: nah. They gave the players more choice in their loadout. I prefer playing with jarate than with the smg.
<Dman> :O TRIXIE TIME
<FlutterHiAtWork> and won't leave
<Dermathil> Valthejean, they haven't.
<Dermathil> It is a mechanic they won't remove.
<Dermathil> That's why some people stick to it and don't play demoknight.
<ValtheJean> but did you actually learn it?
<Dermathil> yes I did.
<FlutterHiAtWork> @dman it's always trixie time
<Dman> lol
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8HlxlwGfKY&feature=related
<Dermathil> I also learnt how to grenade-jump with the basic grenade launcher (just need to get the timing right with the rolling grenade)
<Dman> but this one is trixie - Broken Heart is trying to make trixie evil : /
<Quanyails> 7Well, DRF, I'm paying a dollar. X.x
<Dermathil> I also like to play with the pyro, though I don't use any set.

<Aeroslash> hi kos
<drfsupercenter> 03see, here's the thing, you get people who pay like $10000 so they can get their name on the top donors list, so they actually make MORE money on average than a typical game company. :>

<Dermathil> Pegacorn: nope. What happens is that both are negated. Aka: the immovable is moved, but the unstoppable gradually loses speed. That way at various point in time both happens.

<DeniedExistence> 2. PinkiePie
<Dman> ists of Pandaria is a name trademarked by Blizzard Entertainment[1] that appears to be for some sort of computer game software, but little else is known. MMO Champion speculates that it could be the name for the next expansion.[1] Kotaku pointed out that a similar early regristration of "Cataclysm" turned out to be the new expansion name.
<Sathi> 7it's legit
<Dman> MMO Champion' speculation that it might be the next expansion has been met by skepticism by several media outlets.[3][4] 1UP actually tried to contact Blizzard about this and the reply was "not ready to reveal any details at this time".[5]

<Sathi> 7For the record, the international codes 009 and 041 only seems to appear on Blizzard's online games trademarks. This isn't a book or anything like that. It appears incredibly likely based on previous trademarks obtained by Blizzard that this is the next expansion.
