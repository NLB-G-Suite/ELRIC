<Admiral_Otakon> nothing it is!
<BosonMaidSpectrumRsh> MissShizu: Dutchman ferries souls to the afterlife, the dutchman must have a captain to do that
<swabie_maid_sprinkle> Admiral_Otakon: actually it looks like that scroll is false
<Meanwhile> Nothing whatsoever to do with me.
<Admiral_Otakon> a dress or nothing
<Guybrush_Threepwood> AdmiralYahooz where did the rum go?
<Ryunosuke> Toliver_Hazard_Perry, still no match ofr person man
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Davy Jones is supposed to be guiding souls to the other side. That's his job. But he's been abandoning it.
<AdmiralYahooz> Guybrush_Threepwood: overboard
<MissShizu> 13well yes
<swabie_maid_sprinkle> Admiral_Otakon: the bok of google says its swabbie
<MissShizu> 13and for that he becomes octopus man

<Shooeie> great comeback
<Admiral_Otakon> swabie_maid_sprinkle: well the bok must be right then :P
<MissShizu> 13but it sure seems the souls make it to the other side fine on their own
<BosonMaidSpectrumRsh> MissShizu: some would consider that aplus :S
<MissShizu> 13sure an escort would make it a more pleasant trip
<FirstMaidSabershy> Dat crate of Rum.
<Captain_Michael_Jone> mah heart
<BrigomanFan> Oh Pintel and Raggeti
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Well that's because there are plot holes in this script that you could sail a ship through.
<BrigomanFan> You so silly
<swabbie_maid_sprinkl> Admiral_Otakon: I fixed it, Admiral!
<Admiral_Otakon> hide the rum
<FirstMaid_Cratorkid> Captain_Maid_Discord: the storm is right on us sir!

<swabbie_maid_sprinkl> Admiral_Otakon: Yes, Admiral!
<BrigomanFan> BLUH
<Admiral_Otakon> MissShizu: I think legit
<BrigomanFan> In the Lego Game the plot point of the compass was brought up in the first movie
<Rear_Adminral_Saturn> 08,01Admiral_Otakon: you stop that!
<Admiral_Otakon> Rear_Adminral_Saturn: your the one with the innuendo's left and right and center.

<Toliver_Hazard_Perry> FirstMaid_Cratorkid: Aye, but is he unique?
<Ryunosuke> people in wigs cannot be trusted

<RaveSwabbie> Ouch
<AdmiralSaxy> 0,14Wasn't referring to ye, AdmiralYahooz
<MissShizu> 13well, the biggest plot hole of all is the role of the EITC in the films... the "east indies" are kind of the OTHER DIRECTION from europe...
<Sharakan> how does that guy have so much power?
<FirstMaid_Cratorkid> hey Zanon , welcome to the maid pirates life
<Firstmate_Maid_Angel> Captain_Maid_Discord: *wakes up from AFK napping* sorry capn', i was tired :(
<FirstMate_JESmith67> CriticKitten they read the script

<Toliver_Hazard_Perry> never place dice with a pufferfish man
<MissShizu> 13but they've acknowledged this is an alternate universe where all the sea tales are true, so i guess the company could overrule royal authority
<Meanwhile> I listen to this explanation and I still don't get it...
<Cabinboy_Sid> I actually have that dice game. Little brother got it for his birthday.
<Ryunosuke> well MissShizu they did do trading into the WEST indies as well iirc

<FirstMaidSabershy> Bronysith: Same here. Makes it hard to wake up.
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Firstmate_Maid_Angel: Go right ahead.
<Meanwhile> Lord Cutler Baguette.

<Dken2021> Tyler_The_Creator yea, I'll pretend I didn't hear that

<RaveBrony> TemplemanFan: They can do that? :o
<otakon> dat green screen effect
<Sharakan> note how that was all in one shot
<Alister> How lucky that he didn't land on those rocks
<Kandarihu> No Fuel = Plane explodes on impact.
<sagas> I guess it could be a parachute
<diddutz_> have no fuel ... big explosion ...
<swabbie_maid_sprinkl> i dont trust mythbusters
<Daygon> HA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They had dynamite.
<Dken2021> Kandarihu it was made of explodium
<Nyst> So how does it work then? Does it slow down because it's wide? Does the snow absorb the shock?
<Sharakan> LOL
<Indiana92Jones> AT LEAST IT'S NOT NUKING THE FRIDGE
<swabbie_maid_sprinkl> ^
<TallSquare> another happy landing
<Daygon> DAMN THEY GUYS ARE AWESOME
<TemplemanFan> RaveBrony, you'll fracture a few bones but it's safer than a freefall
<cachi01|mobile> diddutz_ michael bay
<CriticKitten> Nyst: Most likely? Drag from being so wide.
<Spriggals> Im just in time for the Temple of Doom
<Dken2021> wow, she's a whiney one
<Vordox> We ALL hate you woman
<TallSquare> dat pitch drop
<sagas> Nyst: It works as a large parachute
<Shooeie> Shut up Willie
<RaveBrony> TemplemanFan: Cool :D
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> I HATE YOU TOO WILLIE!
<Spectrum_Indy> AND I HATE YOU WILLIE
<Barbetos> Nuking the fridge < jumping the shark
<Nyst> I doubt Mythbusters is going to test out the fridge myth anytime soon.
<CriticKitten> It's light and wide, so it functions like a parachute.
<Daygon> When she said you it was deep like hell
<CECtheRonin> So do I.
<TallSquare> and I hate *deep voice* YOU
<sagas> Nyst: It grabs the air and slows don
<sagas> down
<Sharakan> haha shes named after a penis
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Willie - female Francis, but much more annoying
<Dken2021> Nyst because it's unrealistically impossible?
<Adventure_Striker> Mythbusters did do the fridge myth
<Nyst> Thanks CriticKitten, Sagas.
<cratorkid> Adventure_Striker: how could they?
<Nyst> Adventure_Striker: they got a nuke?
<TWOLOT> so... what is this?
<TallSquare> India Jones
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Suddenly, stopped.
<sagas> So is it weird to go see a movie in theatre on your own?
<TemplemanFan> Nyst: AWESOME
<CriticKitten> So yeah, as bad as people try to make that scene sound, it actually WORKS. It's been tested and proven. The nuke-the-fridge? We don't need to test that, pretty safe to say it's bullshit.
<Dken2021> hai TWOLOT , tekmple of doom
<Adventure_Striker> they had explosives
<Obsidian> Indian Doc Brown
<swabbie_maid_sprinkl> cratorkid: more compromises probably
<Indiana92Jones> DOC BROWN!!!!!!!!!!
<Vordox> 88 MILES PER HOUR
<TallSquare> Brown Doc Brown
<TWOLOT> oh ok.
<Barbetos> GREAT SCOTT!
<MoistMaidPirate> DOC!?
<Adventure_Striker> eww
<TWOLOT> that's cool.
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> This is heavy!
<Shooeie> Doc is that you?
<Indiana92Jones> THIS IS HEAVY, DOC
<sagas> Because I did today and my parent cant seem to fathom why somebody would do that
<Obsidian> AU Doc Brown
<Vordox> I WAS INDIAN TODAY
<Barbetos> Suddenly India Marty McFly
<TWOLOT> love the daring do
<CECtheRonin> Come this way, Doctor Jones. You're gonna see some serious shit.
<TemplemanFan> Daring Do gives no bucks
<TemplemanFan> LOOK AT HER
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Looks like Doc gone back in time to 1935 Indua
<Barbetos> They time travel in a basket
<Barbetos> =D
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> *India
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sagas: Are you yound?
<Nyst> Everything that happened to this point is no longer relevant to the movie.
<Daygon> what is she saying?
<twilight_sprinkle> ythbusters make too many compromises to actually prove anything
<Shooeie> White people are GODS in India
<Daygon> That is sad
<Dken2021> sagas I've done that several times, but probably because people expect to have a group for outings
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Do you mean young? If so, yes
<Indiana92Jones> Daygon Please get our sons back
<Barbetos> Nyst it served its purpose, in that it proves that Dr. Jones is STILL bad ass.
<twilight_sprinkle> creepy
<Indiana92Jones> Daygon according to the plot, that is
<TemplemanFan> No, they're just begging for money Shooeie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sagas: They're just worried about you.
<Kandarihu> sagas, I don't see anything out of the ordinary about that. Maybe there's some extenuating circumstances.
<TWOLOT> i have no idea what's going on
<Barbetos> Bat poooooooo
<Shooeie> What would they do with money?
<TWOLOT> guano?
<Nyst> Barbetos: true. And they did it in the first movie too (and better imo)
<CriticKitten> SHUT UP WILLIE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Guano?
<TemplemanFan> WHAT A BITCH
<sagas> Kandarihu: none than I can think of....
<TallSquare> o.O That was some Thunder I just heard
<Barbetos> eat it or you gona die!
<RaveBrony> Wadda bitch
<Shooeie> DISRESPECT WILLIE
<Dken2021> I can see why people hate her now
<Nyst> Culturally insensitve woman.
<Obsidian> Ungrateful bitch
<XylemTube> Do what the man says
<Adventure_Striker> WILLIE YOU BITCH
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Eat.

<CriticKitten> Just kill her already.
<TemplemanFan> nom
<XylemTube> I bet it tastes awesome too
<Shooeie> EAT IT
<Daygon> TROLL
<fluffle_puff> Troll face
<twilight_sprinkle> Obsidian: to the contrary, she doesnt want to eat their food because they dont have much of it
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: I go to the movie on my own every one or two weeks and I enjoy it. I see nothing wrong
<TallSquare> It's nyasty. Excuse me?! Do you have any chipotle ranch dressing?
<TWOLOT> nice try sprinkle
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sagas: They're just worried you'll get hurt if you're alone.
<TWOLOT> she doesn't wanna eat it cuz it looks like cat poo
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Im 17. I dont think thats gonna happen...
<MoistMaidPirate> Where's Indian Ahnold?
<TemplemanFan> In the Lego game The tribal elder doesn't look as old as he does in the movie
<CriticKitten> DARKNESS.
<Daygon> it must be TWOLOT
<Indiana92Jones> BRB guys.............i gotta go to my granma's house, and then i'll resume watching the film with you guys <3
<TemplemanFan> Here he looks like Yoda
<twilight_sprinkle> TWOLOT: i thought she didnt even taste it

<Daygon> BYE Indian
<TallSquare> dat ethnic superstition
<TWOLOT> tallsquare where did that come from?
<TWOLOT> the charlie murphy thing
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> TemplemanFan: Maybe cause LEGOs don't have wrinkles
<TemplemanFan> Where was Indian Doc Brown when the Indian Terminator attacked?
<RaveBrony> I didnt know people still talked in here :o
<JESmith71> Beinga LEGO person makes you look younger I guess
<Nyst> Building a village on a site that is only fertile with magic stone and barren otherwise seems like a bad idea.
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Also im not exactly a small so I dont think ill be abducted
<CriticKitten> If that's true, damn you, Shiva. We didn't want this movie.
<TallSquare> TWOLOT: CriticKitten said DARKNESS so I said that. It's a thing I do
<twilight_sprinkle> dat kid
<CECtheRonin> All right, gotta go eat. Later, everypony.
<TemplemanFan> Nyst, they had dibs.
<Nyst> At the very least I'd protect the stones better.
<Daygon> Why should he?
<TWOLOT> oh lol
<Obsidian> Bye CECtheRonin
<TWOLOT> buck yo couch
<Barbetos> So. Idea. Lets leave the crazy village, and NEVER come back.

<TWOLOT> they need a guide
<sagas> Adventure_Striker: 6 ft 1
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not they're going to tear your heart out.
<TemplemanFan> Barbetos, but they're the HEROES

<cachi01|mobile> ABOMINATION THAT MENTION
<RaveBrony> Aw :(

<RaveBrony> but i dont have MC :\
<Barbetos> Needs water
<cachi01|mobile> Lol
<CriticKitten> That rock dun goofed
<sagas> Can I mention the abomination of The Crystal Skull?
<Adventure_Striker> I`m only 5`4 1/2
<Barbetos> Oh my
<TWOLOT> sure. i didn't watch it
<LadyMarion> THERE IS NO 4TH INDY MOVIE
<Alister> Not the children !
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka let me go back to my house and i'll join i just found sheeps and pigs :p
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I liked Crystal Skull :3
<otakon> LadyMarion: yes there is
<TallSquare> conversely it takes a rock to raze a village
<LadyMarion> ...Saxy, eat a dick.
<Nyst> Because everyone knows small children are perfect for intense manual labor.
<otakon> LadyMarion: it's called Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
<sagas> SaxyPretender: Aliens.....
<XylemTube> LadyMarion: then what is The Crystal Skill i hear about?
<Adventure_Striker> I BLAME SLENDER MAN
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Barbetos> lol
<LadyMarion> IT. DOES. NOT. EXIST.
<RaveBrony> I need minecraft so bad...
<Nyst> Saxy is from another dimension.
<otakon> Nyst: they fit in the tiny holes and crevices
<LadyMarion> Jesus =/=Aliens
<Alister> Nyst: But children are easier to capture than adults
<XylemTube> LadyMarion: Wrong
<Barbetos> Give him some water you ASS
<Adventure_Striker> I BLAME SLENDER MAN
<Dken2021> otakon lalalal can't hear you what 4th movie lalalala
<sagas> Nyst: They will grow into it and be strong adult workers
<twilight_sprinkle> false, jesus is indeed an alien
<RaveBrony> I didnt think i d like it, but i Love Terraria, so i want to try it
<TWOLOT> children don't have to eat as much
<TemplemanFan> Slendy can't live in India
<Adventure_Striker> I BLAME SLENDER MAN!!!!!!
<TemplemanFan> There aren't any trees
<sagas> Nyst: Hopefully....
<RaveBrony> True
<TallSquare> Its a needless 4th movie. It was like a watered down parody of Indy 1 and 3.
<cratorkid> CONSPRACY
<RaveBrony> :o
<Adventure_Striker> SLENDER MAN CAN BE ANYWHERE
<MoistMaidPirate> Not a drawing of a key?
<TWOLOT> dat face
<Barbetos> Lets be realistic here. If we are to blame anyone for the 4th indy movie it is only ourselves. They knew we would be suckered in by the name ALONE.
<Alister> sagas: They'll most likely grow with back problems form all that work
<Sharakan> so whatever happened to that lao che character?
<sagas> Can we at least agree that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull didnt need to happen....
<TemplemanFan> I LIKED Indy Four
<Daygon> when thought of Adventure_Striker
<TemplemanFan> inb4 hate
<TWOLOT> shooting star
<TallSquare> Well, I did see Harry Potter and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in theatres.
<TWOLOT> i wish the last airbender movie never happened
<CriticKitten> Shannara?
<Nyst> Barbetos: I know. I myself was lured in with the news that Ford would be back as well. Sadface.
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Sharakan: He was never mentioned again(no, srsly)
<CriticKitten> Holy shit, they found the Elfstones?
<sagas> Alister: Oh I know. Thats why you teach them proper lifting
<Barbetos> sagas But it did happen.. and it will be around forver.. just like the prequels...
<cratorkid> elephant
<Barbetos> Life is RUINED!
<XylemTube> Indy 4 Was kinda dumb when the mass of monkeys came around
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> dat Elephant
<Daygon> Elephant is best pony
<TemplemanFan> GOD DAMNIT WILLY
<TWOLOT> wtf why is she so useless?
<TallSquare> I knew The Last Airbender would be a massive failure so I'm not offended by it.
<Barbetos> Close enough
<Spectrum_Indy> do ho ho
<TWOLOT> what is she here for?
<Nyst> Order of best Indy movies: 3 - 1 - 2 with special mention for Fate of Atlantis.
*CriticKitten self-/)s himself for making a reference no one likely understood. ;_;
<Alister> The worse part is Indy barely killed anyone in crystal skull
<TemplemanFan> TWOLOT, because she's "realistic"
<LadyMarion> Willie.
<LadyMarion> STFU
<sagas> I wasnt bothered by the prequals, but I was by Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Is that weird?
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> XylemTube: Oh yes, CG monkeys were completely unnecessary
<TWOLOT> well she's dumb.
<Sharakan> i thought they were poverish but they have 3 elephants
<Adventure_Striker> SHUT UP WILLIE!!
<TWOLOT> ephelants
<Nyst> I like to dream that Fate of Atlantis was the fourth Indy movie.
<Obsidian> Why even take WIllie?
<TWOLOT> :D
<CriticKitten> And it's about now that you realize she's going to be in the entire rest of the film.
<sagas> Sharakan: Not valuable when they are everywhere
<CriticKitten> And you start to sob.
<Barbetos> Worlds?
<otakon> Sharakan: they were gonna eat the elephants you know
<Barbetos> words
<TallSquare> I had hope that the Prequels would get better over time
<Barbetos> Wtf?
<Daygon> sniff
<TemplemanFan> Nyst we should stream that!
<Barbetos> Smell all thet hings
<sagas> Cant they eat the elephants?
<Daygon> She is so dumb
<TemplemanFan> ...Why did Indy only have a huge tub of MAyonaise in his fridge anyway?
<TWOLOT> she's... perfuming her ephelant?
<sagas> Why starve when you can eat elephant?
<Nyst> TemplemanFan: sure, there's a talkie version now.
<TWOLOT> what a silly pony.
<Barbetos> TemplemanFan to keep the mustard curse away.

<Barbetos> Daring Do is not afraid of snakes.
<Kandarihu> She mistook the snake for the elephant's trunk.
<Daygon> she still threw it
<RaveBrony> Yep
<TWOLOT> she thought it was ephelant
<Kandarihu> Blind rage
<TWOLOT> so she didn't freak out
<otakon> Bc she was pissed
<Shooeie> How long has Daring been staring at Nitty's OC?
<JESmith71> And it seems Speilberg actually liked her character...
<TemplemanFan> Back, with Milk, Cookies, and Gummi Worms
<Nyst> Indy's not being very archeological in this movie is he?

<otakon> Nyst: no idea
<RaveBrony> Oh damn
<JESmith71> That was Shooeie who asked not me
<Nyst> Necklace made from fingers.
<TemplemanFan> Thanks to this film India lost half it's tourists
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> CHAT DERP
<otakon> even the elephants are spooked
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> I had to change my nickname
<JESmith71> Long Speilberg quote about Willie:
<TWOLOT> okie dokie doc
<JESmith71> "Willie has led this pampered life and feels that's what's due her — to be cared for and looked after. She meets Indiana Jones, a person unlike anyone she has ever been involved with, and ends up going off with him. In the course of all their adventures, all of her earlier life is stripped away from her, and Willie must fall back on her own resources. She discovers that she is a very strong woman, a gutsy lady. Willie is a much different character
<TWOLOT> the ephelants got jacked
<Adventure_Striker> LET WILLIE BE A TEST SUBJECT!!
<Shooeie> Let Willie go first
<Nyst> If that was his idea then he's failing so far.
<Shooeie> Maybe she will die
<TallSquare> so many cute bats <3
<TWOLOT> let willie fall into quicksand facefirst
<TWOLOT> please
<TemplemanFan> In the Lego game you just skipped to the dinner scene
<Daygon> Shooeie, dont raise our hopes
<Kandarihu> JESmith71, thanks for that quote.
<Kandarihu> Guys, we gotta stop hating on Willie. She gets better.
<Nyst> I like Indy best when he's being a professor; solving clues, finding treasure, ancient temples and the like.
<TemplemanFan> Does Short Round get better?
*Dr_Indiana92Jones Oh, you look like credible people
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> The name's Round. Short Round.
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> LOL
<TWOLOT> if you say so kandarihu
<Adventure_Striker> SHE DOES?!?!
<TWOLOT> for now, i hate her.
<XylemTube> In Diana Jones
<TWOLOT> she'll have to earn my like
<Nyst> Time for a dance number
<Adventure_Striker> O_o
<TemplemanFan> Daring Do is Indy's mom after all

<Alister> TemplemanFan: In what world is an equine parent to an human exactly ?
<otakon> BRITISH!
<Kandarihu> TWOLOT, I did'nt mean to put it like that. I just meant as a suggestion, and... bah. I overstepped my boundaries.

<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Captain Rhubarb?
<TallSquare> Bulmbut?
<RaveBrony> Wuuut

<Barbetos> So... Daring Do is Indies mom. Daring Do had sex with Sean Connery then?
<CriticKitten> Mr. Lawl?
<Nyst> That woman has only one thing on her mind.
<JESmith71> Well it was Speilberg who said it not me

<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Vizcosos, pero sabrosos
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Daygon> I WILL NEVER GO TO THAT PARTY EVEN IF THEY PAY ME
<CriticKitten> Dr Jones, you haven't read the Shannara series quite right.
<TWOLOT> it was his PENIS
<TemplemanFan> Look at Daring, a mother but she BARELY shows it!
<Barbetos> Indiana Jones and the Temple of Tom. Staring Rarity!

<CriticKitten> Dat line
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Again, the caretaker of ''The Shining is responsible''

<Dr_Indiana92Jones> SLAVE?
<cachi01|mobile> BSHIT
<CriticKitten> Except a penis, because let's face it, you're a pathetic stereotypical woman and all that's missing is the wanton sexual lust. >_>
<TWOLOT> don't talk with your mouth full
<Daygon> The best apple for Sweet Apple Acre
<otakon> TallSquare: eeyup they are near a mountain

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Quagmire is proud
<Sumica> 00,10So many inuendos

<TallSquare> You conceited nerf herder!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> x
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Well Excuuuuse me, princess!!!!!!
<otakon> and then bad romance scene
<Daygon> More like 5 years
<Barbetos> Its called masturbation bitch HAHA!1
<ThugeemanFan> HEY TALLSQUARE! THAT'S OUR WORD!
<TWOLOT> five minutes later
<otakon> and then
<twilight_sprinkle> dat musik
<Nyst> So why did Jones try to score with her again?
<otakon> SUDDENLY BEAR!
<TWOLOT> they run into eachother in the hallway
<otakon> SUDDENLY BEAR!
<otakon> FROM OVER THERE!
<Eulshy> Angry sex is better
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Nyst: So she would shut up
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Barbetos> ^
*Adventure_Striker Five minutes later...
<otakon> hey can we cut down on the whimsy a bit?
<TWOLOT> she really wants to smex it up with him
<CriticKitten> Nyst: Because bad scripting. Willie's just a hollow, shitty love interest for this film.
<Alister> Eulshy: Since when is there other kinds of sex ?
<Vordox> George Lucas.... George Lucas.... George Lucas.... Why
<otakon> WHIMSY DOWN!
<ponibas> *yoink*
<Daygon> JUST SLEEP
<TWOLOT> when was the last they...
<Eulshy> Alister pity sex
<TWOLOT> you know...
<Alister> Eulshy: That is the worst kind
<Polydunami> Short Round is a better sidekick than Willie :|
<TWOLOT> click click whistle
<Obsidian> THey both play hard to get, and the both loses
<RaveBrony> fail
<Eulshy> Alister Make up sex
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> OK, Sir John Williams, we love you and all but......tone down the whimsy on the comedy music. You’re making Looney Tunes music look subtle!
<CriticKitten> Nyst: And it boils down to the script writers not knowing how to properly write a female character that can do things other than throw themselves at "strong men".
<TallSquare> John Williams is trying his hardest
<Adventure_Striker> fail
<Alister> Eulshy: That one is good
<Nyst> Vodox: interesting to see that the signs where there back then, but at least then he still had a team of talented people around him to make the movie good.
<Daygon> GIGGTY
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Everyone's a better sidekick than Willie
<ThugeemanFan> GET ON WITH IT
<otakon> AND ASSASSIN!
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> IT'S A TRAP
<XylemTube> SUDDENLY ASSASIN
<TWOLOT> OMG
<otakon> and NO ONE hears this
<TWOLOT> DOES HE DIE?
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Well, maybe except one Lucas character...
<TallSquare> Its like that one scene from Speed Racer
<Vordox> CLONK
<Nyst> CriticKitten: I know! I didn't really care in the past but it's irking me more and more as I get older.
<Polydunami> I prefer Willie Nelson over Willie Scott :3
<otakon> lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Daygon> HA
<Daygon> LOL
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> ooh pajama, how smexy
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Short Round Y U R NOT AWAKE?
<Vordox> WOOOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> O MAI
<otakon> HELP....YOU....BITCH!!!!!

<XylemTube> what a bitch
<Dken2021> avenger?
<Daygon> if you know what i mean
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
*TallSquare rolls his eyes.
<ThugeemanFan> DAMNIT SHORT ROUND
<otakon> and NOW he realizes something is wrong
<Nyst> Jones is beating it in his room.
<Adventure_Striker> CHECK THE DAMN ROOM WOMAN!!
<Dken2021> did the heart part come up yet?
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> OH Noooooow you're awake
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Lol nice one
<XylemTube> lol he ded
<otakon> Okay this would NOT work
<RaveBrony> ded
<TWOLOT> because that's how fans work
<ThugeemanFan> FATALITY
<Obsidian> In front of the kid no less
<Vordox> Assassin be assissinated. WHAT A TWEST OF IRONY!
<Daygon> oh my celestia
<otakon> there is NO way that the fan would be strong enough
<TallSquare> Wow, that fan was built Ford tough
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> SECOND MOST STUPID DEATH EVER
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Eulshy> Nice
<XylemTube> OH MYYYYYYY'
<Shooeie> whore
<otakon> especially back in the 40's
<Obsidian> Denied
<RaveBrony> Be gentle! :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> "You spin me right round, baby right round..."
<Shooeie> Cock-block
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Excuuuuuuuse me, Princess!
<Nyst> Lara Croft she is not.
<TWOLOT> why doesn't he just explain?
<otakon> Assassin search
<CriticKitten> Nyst: 'tis part of the reason I hate Willie so much. She's a prime example of shitty writing. I prefer characters that have some complexity, not boring "I broke a nail" stereotypes that can only be obnoxious and spread their legs for the male lead. >_>
<Nyst> TWOLOT: because she wouldn't get it.
<Eulshy> Snake's cover is blown
<Obsidian> But you are Nobody
<Shooeie> Luv this part
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Indy does not give a fuck
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Secret passage
<Shooeie> These are bigger
*Spectrum_Indy OH MAII

<TWOLOT> XD
<CriticKitten> Guess you could call this a....booby trap.
<TallSquare> David Copafeel
<Shooeie> xD
<TWOLOT> that was a good joke
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> BOOBY-DOOR?
<Obsidian> He prefers the statue
<Polydunami> How many takes did it take for them to not laugh? xD
<Nyst> CriticKitten: A character doesn't even have to have complexity. They can be shallow and superficial, yet still be interesting if written well.
<Daygon> LOL TO BOOBY DOOR
<Shooeie> I guess you can say it was a Booby-trap
<Eulshy> Booby door is best door
<TWOLOT> and to think, he could be getting laid right now
<ThugeemanFan> inb4 he burns the paper
<XylemTube> There are actually people that get off on statues
<TWOLOT> he really needs to get his priorities straight
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Back.
<Zephyr> Archeology > Women
<ThugeemanFan> QUICK, TO THE BOOBY CAVE!
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Indy would rather make out with that statue, than with Willie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't miss Kalima yet.
<Alister> XylemTube: Thanks for telling us that. Now I can sleep easily at night
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> I don't blame him
<TWOLOT> i can see that
<Shooeie> Dont bring the women
<Nyst> XylemTube: or naked store mannequins.
<Polydunami> Say what you will about Willie, but if her claim to fame is screaming all the time... ;)
<Eulshy> No spoiling, i haven;t seen this....
<Daygon> There might be a Boob-mobile
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Because she is literally SO GODDAMN annoying, that the young little Chinese boy who can barely speak English is actually more useful!
<Nyst> Hah, classic.
<ThugeemanFan> GODDAMNIT SHORTY
<TWOLOT> SPOILER ALERT INDIE WINS
<Dken2021> ddang it shortround
<Barbetos> Hey. This is a pretty cool haunted house.
<TallSquare> Redeads. I hate Redeads

*Adventure_Striker pissed his pants
<Daygon> BOOB
<Obsidian> lol
<Shooeie> Oh MY
<XylemTube> Batman Spoiler: the audience dies
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> BOOBS
<Barbetos> Aw yeah
<CriticKitten> Nyst: True, sometimes. But Willie never gets there. She's always obnoxious, ALL THE TIME. She's as shallow as they come, living proof that there is a definite need for people to keep pointing out the double standard between men and women. >_>
<Polydunami> Eww boobs
<TallSquare> oh myyyy
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> oh my
*Nittany_Discord 11,01serves chilled monkey brains to the chat

<Deadlypon3> Really? That's no cookies?
<ThugeemanFan> I LOST MY LAST HOUSE TO ROACHES
<TWOLOT> bugs. why is it always bugs?
<Nyst> CriticKitten: Yeah and her constant high pitched screaming isn't helping. We (the audience) cannot relate to the fears she feels and as such don't care about her.
<Polydunami> *cockroaches
<Eulshy> So many insects
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is a fortune cookie.
<ThugeemanFan> I fucking HATE roaches
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The fortune is bug guts.

<Shooeie> Bugs why did it have to be bugs
<CriticKitten> Good job, Short Round, you killed them both.
<Shooeie> Booby-trap lol
<JESmith> Nittany are they undead monkey brains from the one in Pirates? Those are the best kind
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, thanks, but I already just got my dinner.
<Nyst> Fun fact: this movie set several records in live animals and bugs used in a movie.
<Adventure_Striker> Boobt
<Barbetos> Kid. Why you no stick close to indy?
<CriticKitten> Nyst: Aye, and that's mostly because most girls aren't like that. >.>;
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> A BOOBY TRAP IN A BOOBY LAIR? It must me my birthday
<TallSquare> It looks like they'll have to give a pendant to the Temple Guardian.

<Barbetos> Damnit Saxy
<CriticKitten> So according to this movie, India is apparently adjacent to fucking MORDOR.
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: She, Willie, reacted when he was lowered into the pit, behind her sight....
<Barbetos> Now that song is stuck in my head.
<Tyler_the_creator> Basically an Anti Brony convention right here!
<Firstmate_Maid_Angel> Night' everpony

<Sharakan> sean connery stones
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01"I tore this poor boy's heart out, and all I got was this stupid rock."
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Clearly not, what with the Chinese stereotype child, the white female stereotype, and the Indian stereotypes.
<TallSquare> I thought it was Sikhism?
<Eulshy> Alister Meh, religion
<KalimanFan> DIAMONDS
<Deadlypon3> "DIAMOONDS"
<twilight_sprinkle> DIAMONDS
<Dken2021> Diamish
<RaveBrony> diamonds!
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> DIAMONDS!
<Kandarihu> Alister, Eulshy, it's not hinduism either.
<Alister> Altough , it really is more satanism at this point
<twilight_sprinkle> BIG BEAUTIFUL BEDAZZLING DIAMOND
<JESmith> Vordox I think he means a typical Saturday for these guys in the movie
<TWOLOT> omg shut up willie
<Eulshy> Rich stuff
<Deadlypon3> "Well, that was great guys, let's go out"
<Adventure_Striker> Nittany_Discord: Do you have Lotr?
<cachi01|mobile> SDNOMAID
<Polydunami> This is NOT SATANISM goodness sake
<Nyst> Oh NOW she's interested
<CriticKitten> Why?
<Eulshy> Why does short round remind me of Data?
<Deadlypon3> Mwaaah
<KalimanFan> It's Thugeeism actually
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01"Where's Dave? He said he was going on vacation to Kaleema or something."
<Alister> Kandarihu: But the the general inspiration behind it is. the same way Christinay for the last crusade
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: big deal.
<Vordox> FORCED KISS
<Deadlypon3> "This death thing so good girl"
<CriticKitten> Why do you need the stones? You have no reason to do this.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Adventure_Striker: I don't have any LoTR game.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Racist stereotypes are always a big deal.
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Shame, second one on Console was awesome
<Adventure_Striker> I meant the movies
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: because it means he can be away from Shortround and Willie for a few minutes.
<TWOLOT> don't be racialist
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: have a little fun, would you. there are always villains, and they happen to have a nationality
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka i have no idea how to speak lol
<TallSquare> racist stereotypes make me feel good about myself; like I accomplished something.
<KalimanFan> Whips work that way right?
<TWOLOT> spiderman... spiderman...
<Adventure_Striker> Nittany_Discord: I`m talkng about the movie
<cachi01|mobile> Does whatever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder what happens when they tear someone's heart out but don't throw them in a pit.
<cachi01|mobile> He fucking wants
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: They're a sign of bad writing. You can make a villain without being culturally insensitive.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Adventure_Striker: No.
<Deadlypon3> "WATCH OUT FOR THEIR CHOIR INDIE!"
<KalimanFan> YOINK
<Daygon> What is this movie called?

<Deadlypon3> Yes, be all SLOW about it."
<Adventure_Striker> :'(
<Polydunami> Raiders.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That guy advanced surgery.
<Shooeie> Did Indy just poke his eye out?
<KalimanFan> IT BELONGS IN A MUESEUM
<CriticKitten> And then he got greedy and didn't just run with the stone he had.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,015-minute organ transplants.
<TallSquare> I guess if John Williams cares, I should too
<RainBowJack> RUN DARING DO RUN!!!
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: it's not about the bad guys. More about the wholly inacurrate representation of a real religion, the horrible stereotype for shortround, and the other bits that have always been uncomfortably jingoistic in the Jones movies.
<Deadlypon3> eeyaaahh.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: this is just one part of India
<Tyler_the_creator> ruh ro........

<shuddup> holy crap
<Deadlypon3> Oh look, it's the bronystate administrators
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Find me the location in India that looks like Mordor and is full of cannibalist heathens who worship the Hindu religion in this manner?
*Adventure_Striker JUST SHITS A MASSIVE PILE
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: ahahaha :D
<Nyst> The other two movies never blatantly make it magic though. This is the only one that does.
*Dr_Indiana92Jones Heigh ho, Heigh ho.....It’s home from work we— (whipping sound)
<RaveBrony> Deadlypon3: Rofl :D

<shuddup> FATCHA
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Meanwhile in China

<shuddup> OHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: suit yourself, if you enjoy hating on movies for their whole duration, do it. but i swear, im running a statistic on your negative comments next time we watch a movie you dont like :P
<TWOLOT> idk how they can get out of this
<Nyst> Kali is a real goddess no?
<RAWRity> It's like if the next movie made Christianity the bad guys, and had it filled with white people drinking real blood and baking flesh into tiny wafers, and they dressed up long haired dudes with thorny crowns and crucified them for the hell of it.
<cachi01|mobile> Whip them WHIP THEM HARD
<shuddup> CAP. JOE
<Deadlypon3> Yeah sure, Why not?
<Tyler_the_creator> U rive ronger!

<TWOLOT> shut up shor round...
<KalimanFan> *cart
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: its fantasy, rules are bent
<RaveBrony> D:
<CriticKitten> Nittany: No, it's a heavily overdramatized and completely false representation of a religion that actually exists, to the point where its flaws are downright offensive.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He wants to die?
<shuddup> OMG
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> MY GOD......:'(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He's next week's sacrifice.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: if you want a made up religion, don't use the name of a real deity.
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, only black people.
<shuddup> ohh man thats scary
<KalimaFan> Wierd
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: I see.
<Deadlypon3> "REALLEH!?"
<RainBowJack> i drank my own blood
<Deadlypon3> "I DIDN"T KNOW THAT"
*TallSquare shrugs.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I like watching movies and riffing on them. But this one *is* a bad movie.
<shuddup> CHACKRA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Who is the priest guy?
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: Hammy McOveractor
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: So is World's End, though I enjoy World's End more than this film. :p
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: you know, your hate would be a lot less annoying if you didnt state your opinions as facts
<Polydunami> Mola Ram, peeps.
<Deadlypon3> So...we use kids cause...?
*Jmo4267 glomps Nittany_Discord
<Daygon> Pedo
<Deadlypon3> Why kids? Why not use adults?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ooof.
<Jmo4267> :>
<Deadlypon3> Slave adults are healthier, stronger, and last longer
<TWOLOT> everyone please remember that the internet is serious business.
<Shooeie> Kids last longer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cool story, priest.
<TWOLOT> not to be taken lightly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now explain the sacrifices.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: and i dont even care about this movie, i was afk for half of it. but when i left you were hating on it every minute, i return youre doing the same. give it a rest
<Alister> Deadlypon3: But they can organise themselves and revolt
<TallSquare> still, explorers did misinterpret other culture's religion for the worst.
<RAWRity> Deadlypon3: becuase Kids are far stronger and more accostomed to menial labor than adults, of course!
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> EXPLAIN THE SACRIFICIES, DAMMIT!!!!!!
<Deadlypon3> Alister ...And kids can't :I
<RaveBrony> o_o
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: trolling
<Kandarihu> So in short, all the odd-numbered Indiana Jones movies are good. All the even-numbered Indiana Jones movies are terrible, right?
<Alister> Deadlypon3: It's easir to scare kids
<Tyler_the_creator> They gunna kuss?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And your disagreement might deserve more of my attention if it weren't always based on forgiving every single flaw in a clearly bad movie, and only getting angry at films which are so-bad-they're-hilarious. :P
<Alister> easier*
<Deadlypon3> Kandarihu ...There aren't enough for that
<Nyst> This is easily the darkest of the movies.
<KalimaFan> OH NO

<Nyst> Hey is that the marahajah?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: but youre not making jokes, youre just hating on it. and again, youre stating your opinions as facts, saying that what you think is *clearly* true
<otakon> I see teh Maha Raja is going along with them
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I suspect you'd be bitching if my B Movie ever won. Even though it is *hilariously* bad. :p

<Daygon> JUST FOR FUN
*SaxyPretender is nommed on
<CriticKitten> Go Short Round!
<otakon> well it looks like the brainwashing was cured
<TWOLOT> the kid wanted a little more than a "thank you"
<TWOLOT> if you know what i mean
<twilight_sprinkle> still cant shoot straight
<otakon> HELP SAVE ME SMALL ASIAN CHILD!
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> i'm back.............JUST IN TIME FOR EPIC ACTION SCENE!!!!!!!!!!
<Eulshy> Short Round beat down
<Polydunami> Barbetos, the old guy near the beginning had to read from the script; he didn't speak a lick of English.
<shuddup> dam the kid is overpowerd
<Vordox> 15 Grown Men < Kid
<Vordox> Oh wait
<Franek12354> quadra kill
<Vordox> I FORGOT SOMETHING
<CriticKitten> Hey Willie, wanna take an example from Short Round and, um, be useful?
<Daygon> shortround is mini indiana jones
<shuddup> WTF
<Vordox> 15 Grown men < Asian Kid
<TWOLOT> kid is op nerf pls
<Vordox> There we go
<Barbetos> The kid was in this movie probably becuase of George Lucas and his crazy
<TallSquare> grey steamy action sequences. my favorite
<RAWRity> so while shortround is FIGHTING OFF GROWN MEN, willie's running away.
*Nittany_KaliMa 11,01dusts Vordox with a cloud
<Kandarihu> Vordox, if it matters, then there must be a right mineshaft too that doesn't lead out.
<shuddup> OH SHIT
<shuddup> GUNS
<XylemTube> Franek12354: Ionic Breeze Quadra?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: hes asian, hence unbeatable
<TallSquare> hey shawty, what it is?
<WalkerPony89> RAWRity: And that is why Willie is a horrible character
<otakon> brb need a drink
*Dr_Indiana92Jones Oh, save me, tiny little Asian boy! I hope Indy never knows he can do better than me.
<Shooeie> Better he's Chinese
<CriticKitten> What am I gonna do, to get my Shortie back~
<RAWRity> Shortround's in the movie because The Goonies was popular at the time.
<TWOLOT> tall square needs to man up
<Daygon> LIKE A BOSS
<Polydunami> Short Round is underrated.
<Nittany_KaliMa> 11,01*Splash*
<Vordox> Guns...?
<Vordox> Now?
<RAWRity> WalkerPony89: one of many reasons, actually.
<shuddup> 360 NOSCOPE HEADSHOT NOW!!!
<Taeguk> aimbot
<TallSquare> Indie, use the B button to speed up!
<twilight_sprinkle> Jarjar??
<Vordox> ARE YOU FRIGGING KIDDING ME?! THEY FINALLY TOOK OUT THE GUNS AFTER 20 MINUTES?!
<Deadlypon3> So Uhm...
<KalimaFan> Short Round isn't THAT bad now that I've seen him.
<Kandarihu> And here's the most iconic scene in the movie.
<XylemTube> Dhalsam is not pleased with this
<Shooeie> Red tuneel is bad
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Blue = good, Red = bad
<Deadlypon3> Wait, So the point of that scene was...Moot.
<Shooeie> Blue tuneel good
<TWOLOT> take the LEFT tunnel
<pony_6049> Minecart... Why did it have to be minecarts :S
<shuddup> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Deadlypon3> ITS LIKE A ROLLAR COASTER
<CriticKitten> Short Round at least improved to being useful, though he started as a really bad Chinese stereotype. >_> Willie has yet to do anything.
<TWOLOT> listen to the androgenous voodooer
<PinkiePieYoshi64> This reminds me of Medal of Honor Frontline.... dat one Mine level...
<Saturn> 08,01hullo, lovelies
<Tyler_the_creator> So, was that kid left behind?
<Polydunami> No, you idiot, MY left :|
<Dken2021> Shrotrounds ok, leagues better than Willie, but where the hell does he coem from?
<RawketLawnchair> Oh man, this is just ike those minecart game in Donkey Kong 64!
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> HELTER SKELTER
<TallSquare> I've got a bad feeling about this.
<Tyler_the_creator> ::ew::
<Tyler_the_creator> :ew:
<nocturne> This was the worst level in Donkey Kong Country.
<Polydunami> This came first, RawketLawnchair :3
<CriticKitten> Pewpew
<shuddup> they got pistols
<WalkerPony89> PinkiePieYoshi64: I remember that level! I actually played through Frontline a few days ago! :D
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: she's showed off her cleavage. As far as Lucas is concerned, she'd served her purpose.
<RawketLawnchair> I know, I know.
<Daygon> they suck at shooting
<Vordox> nocturne: I loved them <3
<Shooeie> Willie so useless
<Eulshy> Donkey Kong 64, i beat it
<Polydunami> You know, I didn't have that much trouble with Minecart Madness :S
<TallSquare> I was annoyed at the exessive mine cart levels in DKCR
<XylemTube> Minecart maddness was fun
<TWOLOT> why did he give the breaks to the kid?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> WalkerPony89: I still play it a lot- that game is super fun :D
<Nittany_KaliMa> 11,01What about Donkey Kong 65?
<KalimaFan> HATED this level in LEgo Indy
<RainBowJack> MLP CART race
<Eulshy> Got all 201 Golden bananas
<shuddup> omg
<shuddup> PAYLOAD RACE
<WalkerPony89> PinkiePieYoshi64: IKR? It's just way to short. I wish they made shooters like that nowadays
<Shooeie> Troll
<Kandarihu> She's the damsel in distress. If she died in the firepit, it would've been a bad ending, even though a lot of people here would've rejoiced at it.
<TWOLOT> aaaahhhhh
<Tyler_the_creator> EAT SHIT AND DIE
<Nittany_KaliMa> 11,01I'll get your golden bananas...if you know what I mean. =p
<Alister> o_O
<shuddup> omg
<TallSquare> Honey Minecart don't give a fuck
<Vordox> Nittany_KaliMa: You're not Saturn
<Eulshy> Right in the childhoof
<killerpony7733> Nittany_KaliMa: Oh my
<CriticKitten> Hey guys, remember that scene in Lord of the Rings, where Frodo and Sam were trying to outrun the Balrog in the Mines of Moria in an extended minecart chase sequences?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: Or is he?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> WalkerPony89: Unfortunately they stick too much 'epicness' of graphics in shooters these days, that it kills the storyline completely :/
<Daygon> Tyler_the_Creator, that was a quote from Clayton Carmine
<Vordox> HE just Went RIGHT Tunnel!?
<Vordox> AND THEY WENT LEFT?
<CriticKitten> Was that just me who remembers that scene? D:
<Vordox> !WTF
<shuddup> omg
<Franek12354> trolled
<Shooeie> Best shortcut ever
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: and how legolas kept screaming like a little girl the whole time?
<shuddup> lol
<Deadlypon3> Don't SHOOT the gun, just HIT THEM with it
<RawketLawnchair> Lava!
<otakon> I remember this as a kid
<Tyler_the_creator> GIMMIE THE ASIAN
<TallSquare> Indiana Jones and the Journey To the Center of the Earth
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Is taht Lava below them?
<otakon> I was on this ride
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Suddenly, Short Round is a little Stretch Armstrong........
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: EXACTLY! Wasn't that the most memorable part of LotR ever?
<otakon> it was awesome
<Vordox> Dem stretchy human body
<Deadlypon3> Look at him STRETCH
<WalkerPony89> PinkiePieYoshi64: Unfortunately true. I especially want a shooter that's designied like that, IE no cover system and no regenerative health
<Deadlypon3> He's like a fable 3 hand :D
<shuddup> holy shit
<Daygon> there is the lefft
<Deadlypon3> ...Willie...might wanna stab him
<TWOLOT> no cover?
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: right next to that scene where Aragorn was tossed off of his elephant into some mud when he asked to take a shower.
<KalimaFan> Remember the final battle in Speed?
<Vordox> "Hands the Enemy's hand to Willie, does nothing."
<TWOLOT> what's the point of that?
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh...it's THIS one
<shuddup> ohhh no
<TWOLOT> so you just run out and shoot people?
<Deadlypon3> Well, one useful thing
<Vordox> SHE
<Taeguk> ...
<Vordox> DID
<Spectrum_Indy> Hai Fluffs
<Vordox> SOMETHING
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: True, that was a good scene too.
<TWOLOT> no strategy?
<Daygon> And Daring Do did nothing
<Spectrum_Indy> Hai fluttercry

<Polydunami> How the hell?
<CriticKitten> ....wait
<KalimaFan> Daygon, DARING DO DID MORE THAN YOU EVER WILL
<TWOLOT> i'm missing all the fun
<otakon> kirzstryfe: dude good to see you
<Shooeie> Hai fluttercry
<Kandarihu> Willie knows when to scream and when to punch
<PinkiePieYoshi64> WalkerPony89: Good Celestia! I hate the regenerative health in today's games! Whatever happened to the good ol time when you had to storm a room with like 20 enemies knowing you had 5% health left?
<TWOLOT> my stream is buffering!
<TWOLOT> faaaaaaiiiiil
<twilight_sprinkle> this movie needs more adveenturing and less monotonous loud action
<Vordox> TWOLOT: ICWUDT
<Tyler_the_creator> Fluttershy is here! Yay!
<Shizuka> 13i don't understand why minecraft is playing so horribly badly now...
<pony_6049> o_O
<CriticKitten> So they live in MORDOR and have a giant bucket prepared just in case someone tries to escape through the mine shafts, and....
<Daygon> KalimaFan, what did i do6_9
<otakon> Well he's awfully happy for his entire operation going up in smoke
<Eulshy> Break broke
*CriticKitten bluescreens
<Buytoast> its like that part from lord of the fies, the two towers
<XylemTube> We missed the part where Daring Do rode out of a cave on a mine cart
<Tyler_the_creator> Any horror movies played?
<KalimaFan> NOTHING! BUT DARING DO IS MORE OF A MAN YOU WILL EVER BE
<Spectrum_Indy> ow
<Vordox> MYTH BUSTED

<otakon> YOU ASKED FOR IT!
<Deadlypon3> ALWAYS GO RIGHT
<Daygon> WATER WATER ..... TOO MUCH WATER
<otakon> YOU GOT IT!
<WalkerPony89> PinkiePieYoshi64: I don'mt mind regenerative health, but EVERY SINGLE SHOOTER doesn't need to have it. I hope game devs abandon the idea that every game they make has to be "realistic", because it's getting really overdone
<Nittany_KaliMa> 11,01There's your water!
<TWOLOT> i HATE horror movies
<pony_6049> LOL
<CriticKitten> Yeah, go right, the water....won't follow you that way?

<Vordox> Nevermind
<pony_6049> Oh God
<yetirulez> dat bridge
<TWOLOT> SHOR ROUND YOU IDIOT
<CriticKitten> Hey, I think I remember this scene. This is where the Shadow Bolts try to recruit Short Round, right?

<yetirulez> dat ninja
<Kandarihu> Ah, that callback to the first movie
<Adventure_Striker> NINJEWS!!
<WalkerPony89> Kandarihu: It's still a part of almost every shooter out there, and since most shooters try to be "realistic", it isn't hard to put two and two together. I hope I'm wrong though
<twilight_sprinkle> who needs a gun when you got a whip
<Deadlypon3> "AAHAHHHH!!!"
<Vordox> KalimaFan: Har har
<yetirulez> dat whip

<kirzstryfe> kind of wish I had bought it back when it was only $10, but I don't think the game is worth $30
<TWOLOT> that plan failed
<Dken2021> why is dhalsim threatening us?
<KalimaFan> I remember this level from the Lego game
<Tyler_the_creator> osht

<Spectrum_Indy> Indy ploy
<Nittany_KaliMa> 11,01Shut-up Willy. He knows.
<KalimaFan> It was hard as HELL
<yetirulez> Sup Dken2021 by the way who are you?

<shuddup> SAY SHIT NOT SHOOT
<Deadlypon3> W-Why are you making THEM walk the bridge?
<fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity ah yes...they did tend to scream a lot
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Oh shoooT!! I mean... DAMN!
<Dken2021> yetirulez I am Dken2021 ?
<Kandarihu> WalkerPony89, true realism in shooters would be that not only would lost health not regenerate, but it means an "injured" status where all your stats such as moving speed, aiming speed, max hp, and accuracy takes a hit, and you continue to lose health just because you were shot.

<CriticKitten> And of course there are crocodiles in the river
<otakon> HE HAD A GODDAMN PLAN!
<Dken2021> yetirulez were you here before november 2011?
<Nittany_KaliMa> 11,01And the crocks go a nommin'.
<Tyler_the_creator> SRsly?
<RAWRity> Nittany_KaliMa: it's old as all hell, of course.

<RaveBrony> :O
<KalimaFan> DAMNIT DUDE, WE'RE BOTH TRYING TO SURVIVE
*CriticKitten goes to check if crocodiles actually live in India's rivers, because I don't actually think they do. O.o
<TWOLOT> they only have them when it's convenient for the main characters
<Alister> chat derp damn it
<twilight_sprinkle> OH MY GOOOOOOOD
<Kandarihu> It's a suspension bridge. When's the last time we've seen a suspension bridge that DOESN'T get destroyed?
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Quit sacrificing yourself to Kali! Quit sacrificing yourself to Kali!
<otakon> COVER YOUR HEART!
<Daygon> ew ew ew
<shuddup> OMG WTF
<WalkerPony89> Kandarihu: Well no there's no way that kind of health system would be used, except maybe a few rare instances. I'm imply infering that most devs think regenerative health systems are "realistic" because of their constant use and from devs claiming their whole game is "realistic". Even if I'm wrong, it's still a very overused system
<TWOLOT> DON'T TICKLE HIS NIPPLES!
<TallSquare> Is he hitting a bundle of reeds? what's with that punching sound?
<Nittany_KaliMa> 11,01Short, don't tell him how to kill Indy.
<Vordox> Stop punching yourself
<TWOLOT> MY NIPPLES ARE MINE THEY BELONG TO ME
<Eulshy> YOU BETRAYED THE SHAREHOLDERS
<pony_4249> o they play mlp hear
<RAWRity> I've always wondered how those old rope bridges were made to begin with. It can't have been an easy process.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Daygon> waht is he doing
<Deadlypon3> W-Why did you DO XD
<shuddup> bad
<pony_6049> Well that was pointless lol
<otakon> WalkerPony89: it only works in some cases really like ME or stuff like Prototype
<JESmith> * Insert Goofy holler*
<CriticKitten> Oh hey, they do. Whaddya know.
<fluttercry> 05,15lol wut
<Tyler_the_creator> What a douche...
<Deadlypon3> SO he can have less waiit/
<Eulshy> Miss
<KalimaFan> ARROWS
<TWOLOT> that was good jesmith
<Nittany_KaliMa> 11,01Priest was like "Oh yeah, I forgot. I can tear his heart out. Thanks, kid."
<CriticKitten> OUR ARROWS WILL BLOT OUT THE SUN
<twilight_sprinkle> Daygon: he tried to knock off indy
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Lol
<pony_6049> Now they fire?! >.>
<KalimaFan> SNIPER IS SPY
<XylemTube> Huntsmen!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Indian StormTroopers
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat miss :O
<Dken2021> pony_4249 yea, but only on fridays and saturdays when there's a season on
<Tyler_the_creator> Surprisingly he doesn't get hit once...
<Deadlypon3> W-WAIT< THEY WERE WAITING THERE STILL
<Obsidian> O NOW they decide to use bows
<shuddup> DIE
<Deadlypon3> "A-AAHah_AHAHA-h
<TWOLOT> ow that stings
<CriticKitten> What's this? Willie doing shit?
<Eulshy> They suck at arrows
<Deadlypon3> GET OFF THE BRIDGE
<Deadlypon3> GOOD THINKING SHORTIE
<Daygon> twilight_sparkle, he could had just kicked him
<KalimaFan> DA STONES ARE MINE
<pony_4249> when do they play mlp O.o
<Deadlypon3> ...W-Wait, He didn't betray Shibeh
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: and even now, Indy still has to do the rest of the job himself.
<fluttercry> 05,15YOU BETRAYED SHIVA
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> I will totally steal artifacts and become immortal, but anyone who betrays Shiva? FUCK YOOOOUUUUUU!!!
<WalkerPony89> otakon: In a game where it actually makes sense, yeah. Halo 1 and Reach had great health systems; I really wish more devs would use a system like that
<Dken2021> How dare he betrey the ice summon
<Deadlypon3> W_What?
<twilight_sprinkle> Daygon: he tried, he couldnt
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Use the Forc.... I mean, use the stone, Jones.... the sacred stone!!!
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> inb4 Wilhelm
<Daygon> still
<Kandarihu> WalkerPony89, regenerative health is nothing but a function to add convenience to a gameplay mechanic. If the game dev puts it in their game and then claims to be making everything totally realistic, he's lying through his teeth.
<TallSquare> Why's Shiva… nvmd
<twilight_sprinkle> YOU BETRAYED THE LAWW
<Daygon> STILL
<CriticKitten> Uh
<Deadlypon3> Ow

<Barbetos> Looks like they did not need the stones after all!
<Deadlypon3> "Hahha' Hahahah "Hahah"
<TWOLOT> OMG HAN SHOULD HAVE JUST USED THE FORCE THAT WHOLE TIME
<WalkerPony89> Kandarihu: Like I said before, I like the regenerative health system, I think it can be used appropriately, it's just been done to death
<Kandarihu> Okay, THESE are the Hindus
<Daygon> magic
<Vordox> 88 ROCKS PER HOOOOUUURRRR!!!!!!!!!

<Polydunami> And I'm not talking about seven minutes in heaven, here :|
<Dken2021> Eulshy Kali ma!
<CriticKitten> Alister: Most people don't hate it actually. Even I like this movie, though it's pretty darn offensive to the Hindu culture and it's not at all well written. But ever since Crystal Skull, most people don't actually find this one that bad. Perspective matters.
<Vordox> QUICK Indy, grab my whip/ADVENTURE
<Deadlypon3> NO SHE"S THERE :D
<Daygon> YAY
<Striker> there goes daring
<kirz|art> Utada, GitS, Basshunter, all on the same station :)

<pony_6049> Yeah there's dark, but if it's done correctly, then it's going to be really fun to watch
<shuddup> TORNADO
<Daygon> and she is back

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Eulshy> Dken2021 Am ilak
<TallSquare> I can't decide if this movie was better or worse than Sahara
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ooh
<pony_6049> I could think of 3 things that were considered dark, but was fun to get in
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> IMO this was more memorable than Crystal Skull.....(except for the Fridge)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hearts being ripped out/10
<Polydunami> If you want a dark soundtrack, watch Hunchback.
<Kandarihu> Wasn't Lao Che the same actor who played Tanaka in Blood Sport movie about David Dukes?
<KalimaFan> BRUCE NICHOLSON
<JESmith> For those who missed it at intermission here's more Daring getting blown away
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it's a bad movie, but it's not the worst jones film by a wiiiiiide margin.
<pony_6049> Crystal Skull I enjoyed too :P
<shuddup> voodoo kid/10
<Shooeie> I guess you can say Nitty's OC blew Daring blew Daring away
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> John Williams/10
<WalkerPony89> CriticKitten: I'll admit, this is my least favorite Indy movie (Not counting Crystal Skull of course), but it's still a fun movie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Does everyone hate Indy 4 for the fridge scene?
<KalimaFan> CHUCK WILEY, MODEL MAKER OF ACTION
<Shooeie> No
<pony_6049> Oh no. I thought it was clever lol
<KalimaFan> Nope
<WalkerPony89> Nittany_Discord: I hate it for the aliens
<Dken2021> I don;t think iit's just the fridge scene
<Polydunami> What about Shia Laboeuf?
<yoyomatt123> no
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shooeie: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaah!
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> You are tearing me apart, Creepy Weird Skull Hat Guy!/10
<Shooeie> He is just being Pinkie
<Daygon> GOOD MOVIE
<WalkerPony89> Shia Laboeuf too
<Obsidian> No. I thought it was hilarious
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Nah it's a cool gimmick though it's unrealistic
<Eulshy> Nittany_Discord, the fridge scene is the best in that movie
<Deadlypon3> Shia Laboeuf is fine
<KalimaFan> Shia Lebouf was an ASSHOLE
<pony_6049> I know logically it's impossible, but they did take their chances into making into that conclusion
<TallSquare> This movie was bad, but at least it was original.
<Deadlypon3> Shia Laboeuf is FINE.
<Polydunami> No no nonono no no NO
<Barbetos> Nittany_Discord The fridge scene is so memorable I think becuase people like to compare it to the "jumping the shark" thing
<RAWRity> Actual Canniba Shia Lebouf
<Shooeie> Acting lessons woldnt hurt
<KalimaFan> Shia Lebouf was an ASSHOLE
<fluttercry> 05,15Honestly, I thought Temple of Doom was worse than Crystal Skull

<twilight_sprinkle> Dken2021: i dont see it, usually afroamerican have different stereotypes
<WalkerPony89> Polydunami: Because parents these days are morons. Don't want them calling Treehouse saying they're "offended" and they're gonna sue
<twilight_sprinkle> *a different stereotype
<otakon> to India!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, iirc, Jar Jar was a Jamaican charicature
<RAWRity> ...did twilight_sprinkle just use the term afro-american in 2012?
<shuddup> no
<Daygon> THESE GUYS AARE IDIOTS

<Dr_Indiana92Jones> NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONO

<Buytoast> oh man, i'm naming off reasons i don't like the movie! i better have people act obnoxiously to further reinforce my beliefs and make myself seem better
<TWOLOT> lol he's totally right
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: it hasn't been used in 30 years.
<Buytoast> this guy is such a selfabsorbed douche
<kirz|art> "is the router plugged into the modem", "is the computer plugged into the power socket", etc. :3
<CriticKitten> No, it's not, since Mythbusters proved that this works.
<shuddup> lol
<CriticKitten> So yeah.
<Tyler_the_creator> lmao
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: probably because im not sosensitive
<Tovler> Harrison Ford was still hawt.
<otakon> Buytoast: um it's not always like this
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ohhh
<Deadlypon3> Critickitten Not the point; It's less believable :P
<pony_6049> What did Mythbusters prove?
<otakon> Indian Doc Brown
<WalkerPony89> CriticKitten: When? WHEN?
<Striker> PONY ROCK ANTHEM!!
<StinkomanFan> DAMNIT CANDYMAN
<MirrorImage> CriticKitten - i thought they proved that it didn't work
<CriticKitten> Deadlypon3: No it's not. O.o
<MirrorImage> at least not "riding" the raft
<Dken2021> Buytoast what a great reviwer /sarcasm
<Daygon> ikr
<otakon> pony_6049: that you can use a raft as a parachute
<Polydunami> YFW this man came BEFORE Doc Brown. Well, was in a movie released earlier.
<MirrorImage> as a parachute, yes; as a glider, no
<WalkerPony89> Children last longer
<RaveBrony> Simple step by step stuff? :P
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> OH THE IRONY!
<shuddup> LOL
<pony_6049> otakon: Ah I see. Thanks
<fluttercry> 05,15Mythbusters said the Raft was BS
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: and youre assuming english is my native language and i know what terms are old or not?
<kirz|art> you'd think so
<Spectrum_Indy> for the poon
<cachi01|mobile> Bronystate raft?
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> otakon: I'm sorry

<TWOLOT> you see? everyone hates her.
<Obsidian> lol
<Daygon> THAT IS TRUE EVERYONE AGREES
<shuddup> lol
<StinkomanFan> YAAAAAAAAAAY
<MirrorImage> otakon - riding the raft down they busted; but they tried using it as a parachute and it rougly worked
<CriticKitten> Deadlypon3: A lead-lined fridge being hurdled along at high speeds versus a raft being used as a parachute? Yeah, sorry, the former is definitely more implausible.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: I'm assuming you wouldn't use a term that's been out of the lexicon for longer than you've been alive.
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> Rob Schneider movies?
<JESmith> And Speilberg thinks she's a gusty character...geez
<otakon> MirrorImage: yeah that I meant
<Deadlypon3> Critickitten not saying either is believable
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: who gives a shit
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: also, stop taking shit so seriously. It was a joke brah.
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Yeah, i remember now. Raft was busted. Escape slide was plausible though

<thisguy> i loved that movie as a kid :)
<WalkerPony89> Tyler_the_creator: YES!

<Deadlypon3> Willie is not so ANNOYING its just that they FORCE her to be annoying!

<kirz|art> I've had to do it for old people I don't know, that were already frustrated from trying it >.<
<shuddup> magica scmagic BOOOO

<Dr_Indiana92Jones> LOL dem normal people
<MirrorImage> Polydunami - probably
<shuddup> EWWWWW
<WalkerPony89> Spectrum_Indy: Is it low budget?
<RAWRity> Polydunami: yes
<RaveBrony> Damn... I wouldnt be able to do that O_o
<MirrorImage> most "children's" movies would i would expect
<otakon> it's a boy
<kirz|art> though I do find it funny when someone can't get something to work, they bring it into the store, then I touch it and it starts working >.>
<Spectrum_Indy> WalkerPony89: i have know idea
<Polydunami> I'm guessing it would be a B movie, even if it was directed by Tim Burton.

<RAWRity> WalkerPony89: he's horny.
<Polydunami> Yeah, I call bullshit on the 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes
<TWOLOT> yoink
<superretroworld> RAWRity: its like this, NC: ok fans, i made a new review, now you must hate it :[
<Daygon> THIS GUY IS SUCH A CRYBABY
<StinkomanFan> Peewee's Big Adventure was THE BEST EVER
<WalkerPony89> RAWRity: Good point
<otakon> superretroworld: um no not really
<MirrorImage> why is Spiderman choking Indiana Jones?
<CriticKitten> Dat stupid death
<cachi01|mobile> Peewees big adventure was just peewee looking or his bik
<Dken2021> MirrorImage he owed him one
<TWOLOT> because that's how fans work
<shuddup> HOLY SHIT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Push them boobs.
<otakon> lol
<Daygon> BOOBY DOOR
<RAWRity> superretroworld: except he's even made reviews specifically stating that it's perfectly fine for people to like what he doesn't.
<cachi01|mobile> BOOOOOOOBIEEERS
<Polydunami> And they made it entertaining, cachi01|mobile xD
<otakon> RAWRity: like The Grinch
<Daygon> THIS GUY IS SUCH A CRYBABY!!!:[
<XylemTube> the chinese boy is cool
<MirrorImage> dohoho... he said booby
<WalkerPony89> INDDDDYYYYYY
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: well, hes more of a comedian than a critic
<Ryunosuke> boobies
<RAWRity> otakon: that one even had him say it in rhyme.
<JESmith> cachi01, and it had LARGE MARGE and the Tequila scene
<Kandarihu> LOL, Booby door leads to booby trap
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> superretroworld: Not necessarily the case here........He's the Nostalgia Critic, not the ''BAD MOVIES'' Critic.......this movie is definetly nostalgic
<fluttercry> 05,15NC is not meant to be taken 100 percent serious
<Ryunosuke> ^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like Zero Punctuation
<otakon> Daygon: that is the point, he makes decent points about movies in a hyperbolic manner
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Boobie Door leads to Boobbie Trap... sems legit.
<otakon> what fluttercry
<kirz|art> I've seen a few lcd tv's with impact fractures, those can be cool to see
<TWOLOT> he's so right though
<Dken2021> yea, Critic's more of a comedian than a reviwer
*Nittany_Discord 11,01takes fluttercry
<TWOLOT> this movie was completely stupid

<Tovler> Well, out-of-character Doug did get pretty worked up in Twilight Breaking Dawn review.
<CriticKitten> Dat Kali
<superretroworld> yeah thats true thats its only his opinion
<Kandarihu> Collie?
<Dken2021> I don't even know why he still calls them reviews
<JESmith> Yeah this is for comedic effect. It's like AVGN he's doing some of this as an act for comedy
<PinkiePieYoshi64> ITS A DOG!!!
<TWOLOT> yay daring do
<otakon> lol
<StinkomanFan> We also need to watch Yahtzee's LEGO INDIANA JONES review
<Daygon> otakon its just so stupid
<TWOLOT> DON'T TOUCH MAH NIPPLES
<RAWRity> Tovler: that was mostly because Twilight of all things was trying to talk about abortion and women's rights.
<fluttercry> 05,15Like Yahtzee, they both have points, but they exagerate for comedy. You aren't supposed to view it as a serious review
<otakon> Daygon: that's half the point it's called COMEDY
<WalkerPony89> StinkomanFan: We need to watch some ZP period
<kirz|art> person bringing it back says it doesn't work, so I take it out of the box, plug it in, see a nice little spiderweb fracture like they dropped it on a table corner when they were setting it up
<shuddup> lol
<kirz|art> so many colors
<JESmith> And maybe watch that 5 minute Lego Indy and the Raiders of the Lost Brick thing
<Dr_Indiana92Jones> As he said out of character (As Doug Walker) ''People shouldn't take the Critic seriously''
<twilight_sprinkle> Nit-censor

<Vordox> SaxyPretender: If it's a "Fast animation" overdrive. we can enable some GOD combos
<Vordox> SaxyPretender: Even during mid games, like Blood Kain

<Shizuka> 13aaaand traveling out of the nether crashes minecraft
<Shizuka> 13yaaaay
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, if it's doable mid combo then fine, i guess
<Vordox> SaxyPretender: Imagine Bang insta Furinkazan during combos for some high damage
<Vordox> Also, you sure you can only overdrive ONCE per game?
<kirz|art> Shizu crashes everything
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but you already have that
<oni_link> this song <e

<oni_link> lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Overdrive, iirc, has its own meter
<SaxyPretender> 0,14once that's filled, you have to hit an Offensive Burst in order to trigger it
<Vordox> Oh the red meter, aye
<SpadeMagnes[R> When can we add some fun to this tornado alley?

<MadSurge> Ohei Spell-of-Gaming!
<Spell-of-Gaming> I used to be productive until I got suckered in to the internet more. :3
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh the internet, how you take our livelyhood and grind it into a fine powder where it is made into a balloon and held in the hands of a 10 year old kid who rages at you.
<CountDoofus> Go Bruce!

<HellsFortune> possibly
<Sneaks> I believe so?
<Serenity> All the workers are Gordon Freeman
<Serenity> They live in the vents :/
<Chrysalis> one does not simply make a logical game about batman
<Sneaks> GO BATMAN! FLY INTO ACTION WITH A LOUD SWINGY THING SO NOBODY CAN HEAR YOU!
<JRP2234[web]> Phase4: play zelda 2
<Chrysalis> this game was so much easier to deal with when i switched to using a controller
<Sneaks> Go loudy batty
<Sneaks> Lol
<AdamTheDuck> JRP2234: Let him play what he wants
<Sneaks> I was going to suggest portal if he was up for suggestions :P
<Chrysalis> hell play what he wants
<Sneaks> Ik ik
<Chrysalis> considering he doesnt have to stream at all, just be grateful hes playing at all
<Chrysalis> also, hai Wrek

<Sneaks> ???
<Chrysalis> Yeah Asylum was pretty cool, i did like the open world of Arkam City
<Serenity> *What is this sorcery*
<CountDoofus> Phase4: you could've placed explosive gel on the wall, that would've knocked out the thug. Maybe.
<Phase4> 00,02meh
<Phase4> 00,02was going for a silent takedown
<Sneaks> But that failed miserably XD

<Sneaks> Or something new?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05night sb ^_^

<Serenity> Phase4: We can tell
<andy> try different stuff
<CountDoofus> dat Joker raspberry :D
<Sneaks> I'm back
<CountDoofus> Phase4: when you glide kick an enemy, try to perform a ground takedown. You can also hang from the gargoyles and perform a silent takedown when a thug passes under it.
<Sneaks> MUFFINS!
<Sneaks> Awwwww
<Serenity> Mods, stop it with having like 7 windows open. It makes El Shitbox sad
<andy> ...

<Shane> any1 mods on i have a question
<Phase4> 00,02how do you silent takedown from gargoyle?
<Phase4> 00,02also wont let me ground takedown it seems
