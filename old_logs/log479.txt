<GilDash> Ninjazz: She's a very classy pony. ;)
<hen3ry> Personally, Rarity is my least favorite, only because I relate to her the poorest - I can see myself in the other 5. Doesn't mean I actively dislike, but... eh.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: I would like to see more Rarity and Rainbow Dash moments actually. Never been tried before so it would be interesting.
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: I dislike her, somehow.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: That. So much that. :D

<Invi> am I the only one whose fav is Twily?
<DerpSurge> Lunch is done. And I totally support you GilDash :D

<Ninjazz> GilDash: I never saw her as a lesbian as well.
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> i was playing doom
<VioletGreySha> Invi: you are not alone <3
<GilDash> hen3ry: I think Twilight has potential and might experiment. Rarity possibly. The others are hit or miss really.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Everypony on the internet did, and the damage had already been done.
<Invi> wohoo VioletGreySha <3
<rdibp> Applejack dosent even have her own song :(

<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: ....I just see the ponies think differently than me, but I guess you're right.
*alexxm teaches rdibp how to do a chokeslam and piledriver
<Invi> Irish_Pony it's a trap by the new barking virus

<rdibp> OH WAIT I thoguht we were all bark from a tree
<dishwasher_EXTREME> gotta go guys and i dont ill be back any more for the next year
<TheRainbowDash> What the hay is barking virus? Infection of dogs?
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Usually throwing in Rarity makes ANYTHING tolerable for myself. I have problems with Young Spike pairing but Older Spike is good.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I think Spike and Sweetie Bell actually adorable. :)
<Irish_Pony> Invi: Well Im already sick so theres no point :P
<rdibp> Rarity is my least favorite pony
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I'm fine with any Rarity and Spike shipping.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Oh yes, indeed.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: So if I said... Rarity x Spitfire... :$
<TheRainbowDash> rdibp: You're completely right.:)
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: It's just strange.. :S
<rdibp> :$
*Ninjazz ignores the fools
<Invi> Irish_Pony ok then go ahead, but remember what happened to the barking pony from ''read it and weep it''
<hen3ry> I prefer crack-pairings.
<TheRandomkid321> Ninjazz But spike never ages unless he becomes a horder. SO IT WOULD NOT BE CANNON!
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Wait...
*VioletGreySha glopms Ninjazz in a corner

*Airpuff dies
*Invi revives Airpuff in a pagan ritual
<d3rb> mario_pony: the line is fine....the way the fanbase ran with it is WAYY over the top
<Ninjazz> Honestly, the reason why I love Rarity so much is because of her redeeming moments. Not just her singer, voice acting, her style, her looks... So on and so on. But the way she can put herself infront of everypony and still be their friend.
<Irish_Pony> What happened to all the wub?
*Airpuff wakes up before dieing again, having seen mario
<mario_pony> dead
<pony_8304> i mean im not saying i hate her
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Are you trying to make me feel better?
<pony_8304> just she could be more well devoloped
<pony_8304> same as the cmc running gag
<Invi> Ninjazz what do you mean with put infront of everyppony?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Yeah. Rarity reminds me of me when I'm generous. I think I identify with her the most, really. I mean, I fucking drempt I *was* her and I acted accordingly. So... yeah. :D
<mario_pony> Airpuff: lol why you die?

*Airpuff throws a soap over to GilDash ...
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: Yeah, I always take these opportunities well.
<flutter_spin> I've been playing Mass Effect 3. It has been awesome!
<Monfang> I can tell these things. I was playing Civ 4. Warlord difficulty. I got into a war with Gengus Kan early on. Steam Rolled.
<flutter_spin> Couple of gripes, but overall awesome
<Ray> 02Who is talking?
<Ray> 02Who just did !pokemon?
<GilDash> Airpuff: How is *that* supposed to help... NOW THEY'RE LATHERING EACH OTHER UP!!! :$

<Monfang> Warlord is a tick higher than easy
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Rubbing.
<Airpuff> GilDash: Who said i was going to help you? ;)
<TheRainbowDash> http://fav.me/d4nrwt4 Dashie, ummm, you want to see me?:D
<Monfang> I had walls and archers defending my cities. But he just walked right though them.
<Airpuff> GilDash: And btw... i am helping you... just the "oposite" way you.. "want"...
*GilDash places hooves over eyes and sighs. "Clear your mind, clear your mind..."
<Monfang> And I knew that every time a unit of mine was killed, his got stronger.
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: You know that won't work.
<Monfang> And I couldn't kill a single one of his.
<Airpuff> Octavia! :$http://derpy.me/muot-

*Invi pokes Alicorn_Prince_Shane with a stick against the head
<Monfang> Also, my cheap headset is about to give out. I have to wrestle with the cables where it connects to the volume control to get it to work.
*Airpuff gives GilDash a balloon.. "Can you blow it up for me?" ;)
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> alexxm: good about to go to sleep but thes 2 fillies Invi and Airpuff arent letting me
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Woah, what curves?
<Airpuff> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Hai! :)
<Monfang> I'm debating opening it up and seeing if I can fix it. Or if that would just make it good and broken.
<GilDash> Airpuff: ... ... ... I'm not even kidding. There are 3 ellipses there.

<Lil_B> Alchemist I would like to do something metal releated, expecially in the parts of Computer and electronics (Stuff like the new Jelly Battery) but I would be fine with anything research, I just don't want something too repetitive
<GilDash> Saturn: I like Luna more. :)
<dishwasher_EXTREME> tanzania'
<Nyria> Saturn: I would say Luna~
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: .. So you buried them!? :$
<Ninjazz> Saturn: Luna, hands donw.
<Chrysalis> Luna!
<Lil_B> Saturn Luna, I love her colors
<Airpuff> Saturn: Luna.
<ScootaChicken> Chrysalis: 1. I'd need an adult for that 2. Don't have enough money 3. Not sure whether the hotel would approve of me camping out in someone's room for free
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: Eyup. :S
<CCCP> ;ims jo@@@@
<dishwasher_EXTREME> luna'
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Why is Airpuff staring at you like that? :S

<XAX> Saturn: At least then, the winner would always be able to hook up with Saturn, should they have a problem.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Bring the good pics back. ;)
*Airpuff stares at Ninjazz "What! Are you leaving already?!" :)
<DerpSurge> Saturn: I wanna see the "censored" cutie mark too :D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: We'll see. ;)
<Alchemist> Lil_B: if you want to be a researcher, nothing will be repetitive, thats 100% sure. Cleaning glassware and restocking labs, thats repetitive.
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: Yes. :|
<Nyria> Saturn: Well you're giving it to somebody else I'd think they would like a canon toy~
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: Why!? :)
*GilDash kisses Ninjazz on the nose.

<QT_Marks> Phase4: ha, i'm always torn beween twi and aj
<GilDash> Airpuff: ... I don't even know. :D
<Saturn> 08,01Luna as first prize, Twilight as second
<ScootaChicken> Nyria: Princess Platinum, because she's the UKofE mascot, Octavia, because everyone loves Octavia and she represents the absolute class of those living in the UK, and Pinkie Pie because she represents our more chaotic side.
*Phase4 hugs QT_Marks
<QT_Marks> :)
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Saturn just make your OC
<Bronysith> Saturn: i want twilight molestia and lunaughty
<ScootaChicken> Whoops, that message was meant for Saturn.

<Phase4> CCCP, keyboards are not an apropriate place for your face
<Lil_B> Bronysith why not Lil' Miss Rarity?
<Nyria> ScootaChicken: That is a good idea~ And I don't either :p

<CCCP> Phase4: but i was having fun :(
<dishwasher_EXTREME> FREEZE!!!! POLICE
<XAX> Chrysalis: Who is best ship?
<ScootaChicken> Anyway Saturn: Princess Platinum/Rarity, because she's the UKofE mascot, Octavia, because everyone loves Octavia and she represents the absolute class of those living in the UK, and Pinkie Pie because she represents our more chaotic side.
<Chrysalis> noo, twilight x luna
<Airpuff> GilDash: Who knows, i just ate the noodles! :P
<XAX> Chrysalis: YES /)

<Ninjazz> Truth be told, I never shipped otakon... Not sure I'm sad about that.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> CCCP ?
<Airpuff> Saturn: .. "Dont use your fancy mathmatics at me!"

<Ninjazz> GilDash: Shame on you.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> weird
<Ninjazz> :P
<GilDash> Airpuff: Doesn't matter. Maths is Kung Fu anyway.
<Irish_Pony> Somepony stream something!
<GilDash> Ninjazz: This was back before it was a bannable offence mind.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> double rainboom
<Saturn> 08,01equations are not allowed to take the form ∫(otakon) dx, where x =/= otakon
<Ninjazz> GilDash: You were here back then? :S
<Airpuff> GilDash: .. i guess.. since kung fu is everything right?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Possibly... :)
<Irish_Pony> Saturn: um...Pi?????
<GilDash> Airpuff: Exactly. :)
<Saturn> 08,01basically, that's maths for "don't ship otakon with anyone except himself"
<Airpuff> GilDash: .. so that means.. Saturn = Kung fu too?
<GilDash> Saturn: Can you do that? Can you be shipped... with yourself? :O
<Saturn> 08,01i actually wrote a song about shipping otakon
<Airpuff> Airpuff x Airpuff... ?
<Bronysith> Saturn: seriously
<Nyria> GilDash: I think you can~ Afterall many people do it in their spare time~
<Ninjazz> GilDash: You can be shipped with your own hooves.
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: yup
<Simon> Saturn: I challenge you: ∫e^(x^2) dx = ?
<Irish_Pony> Saturn: Why...why would you do such a thing?
<Bronysith> Saturn: awesome
<Saturn> 08,01in the style of a G&S aria
<GilDash> Nyria, Ninjazz: ... Oh my. ::D
<dishwasher_EXTREME> imagine otakon is x and the chance that he will get shipped is y when we mutiplied x by y divided by triple shipped chance like ninjazz or gildash we have....
<Ninjazz> GilDash: :3
<Saturn> 08,01Simon: easy

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Who's publishing the XCom remake?
<cachi01> Alchemist: for linking the website x-com will be delayed again lol
<Lil_B> Cypresswolf we wants even had them in germany, when we had a heat record in the summer a few years ago
<Chrysalis> thanks Nittany_Discord ;)
<Somebronyyayz> Playing Pandemic 2 again....

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: Thanks?
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Who cares. It's going to be an FPS anyway. :S
<Chrysalis> for dat last kick
<cachi01> ^ :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K.
<DerpSurge> GilDash: Nonono, they're making a legit X-COM game now!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If it's a major publisher forcing it to be an FPS, then you have a bad reason behind the choice.
<Alchemist> my chat derped
<Alchemist> someone pinged me?
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: I've been calling them hummingbird moths :D Was told thats what they were when I showed a picture of the 1st one spotted to my class of Master Naturalists
<GilDash> DerpSurge: I'll believe it when I see it...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's like the Syndicate remake. EA published that.
<Ninjazz> Yeah... I think they are making an FPS and a remake.
<Chrysalis> i still like how MW3 was outsold by blackops
<RyunosukeKnT> History of the World: Part 1?
<Hat> Dishonored might be good
<Derpyty> g
<Derpyty> gf
<Derpyty> gfd
<Derpyty> gf
<Chrysalis> they are blaming market saturation
<Derpyty> gfg
<Derpyty> d
<Lil_B> DerpSurge there are multible X-Com remakes, one of them is an FPS, the other one will be something else
<Chrysalis> when they did it all themselves
<cachi01> Hat: ITS GOING TO BE EEEEEEEEPIC
<Saturn> 08,01Cypresswolf: that's what they're called: the hummingbird hawk moth
<Hat> Hopefully it is like the trailer
<cachi01> yeah i hope it doesnt end like dead island
<Alchemist> Nittany_Discord: nono, they are making a legit remake, not the fps one, and I think they have Sid Meier as a consultant. thats a good sign IMO.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01spheres
<Lil_B> Chrysalis the MW Frenchise broke sales records 3 times in a row :/
<Saturn> 08,01or Macroglosum stellatarum, iirc
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Alchemist: Sounds fun.
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Market saturation?! Obviously the solution is to saturate it further then! =_(\
<valoreins> moths... one time in my high school a friend of mine found an atlas moth
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MW3 sold a lot of copies in a day.
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord I think 3 mill
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But its sales have tailed off faster than BO's.
<Hat> I don't think MW3 got to the top of Top Sellers on Steam's page
<Alchemist> MW3 is an interesting case. Its NOTHING new and still people loved it.
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord they finally actually paid of mw2 as well
<Ninjazz> BO was a better game anyway.
<Cypresswolf> I still have my Dad's camera...with a 300x zoom lense :) I need to plan a trip to Memorial part for a photo trip before he asks for it back

<cachi01> alexxm: yeah lol
<alexxm> hey CCCP hows your day been
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I still play games. I just lost the joy of waiting for new titles. Publishers have ruined them enough in development that I don't get excited about them anymore.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello CCCP! I think we're watching more science videos, provided by Saturn.:)
<CCCP> alexxm: its been pretty boring
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still love Nintendo's conference

<CCCP> hi Saturn :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> it always brings some entertainment
<cachi01> nintendo's conference are always great
<Lil_B> I'm waiting for the VGA E3-Coverage and the Lordkat one... Will E3 be streamed onn BS?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still remember that one where they revealed the 3DS
<CrimsonPhoenix> They had BITCHES
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was hoping the latest Twisted Metal would avoid publisher bullshit, but Sony forced an Online Pass on the dev (it was forced).
<alexxm> what games are they working on now cachi01
<Lil_B> cachi01 YES (If I'm a Fanbopy of anything, it's Nintendo)
<cachi01> alexxm: i think ssm for 3DS and new super mario bros 2
<cachi01> alexxm: and i dont know if they already finished luigis mansion 2
<Michael> history of humanity :D
<Lil_B> alexxm they wanna talk about Pikmin 3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jafee doesn't like online passes and didn't want to use them, but Sony forced him. So, lost sale.
<cachi01> also pikmin 3!
<CrimsonPhoenix> also Nintendo is probably going to talk alot about Wii U
<cachi01> alexxm: ssb*
<CCCP> there needs to be moar kirby games
<CCCP> kirby is the best thing ever made
<MegaMoonShine> CCCP: Yeah!
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: As I don't follow much video gaming these days, what are online passes? :S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So many major titles are lost sales for me, I don't want to get excited for them.
<CCCP> MegaMoonShine: :D
<cachi01> i want ace attorney 5!
<CrimsonPhoenix> CCCP calm down, we had Kirby Return to dreamland
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Oh boi...
<NewDCD> 09,01Nittany, come to fighting games
<Michael> need moar metroid games
<NewDCD> 09,01we don't deal with that bullshit
<CrimsonPhoenix> and even there we also had some good DS Kirby games
<CCCP> CrimsonPhoenix: but we need! moar!!! :D
<cachi01> moar zelda games!
<Princess_Molestia> Sith, RP?
<Derpyty> how many days intill um the person reading MLD ?
<NewDCD> 09,01unless it's lolCrapcom
<Vordox> NewDCD: Get Extend :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> CCCP you played Mass Attack?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: What? :S
<Lil_B> Michael the are rumors about a Metroid game by EPIC-Games
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: It's a code that grants you access to the MP part of games. They only give it out in new copies. Anyone that buys used has to pay for the code.
<Alchemist> pale blue dot.mov?
<Ninjazz> GilDash: There you go.
<CCCP> CrimsonPhoenix: actually i have not, is it good?
<NewDCD> 09,01Vordox, I'm on it...Limited Edition is Used - Like New for $25 in Amazon
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's great
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord theres nothing wrong with that though
<Michael> Lil_B: rly? great :)
<NewDCD> 09,01I'm saving up for it and streaming gear
<cachi01> Lil_B: wow by metroid with gore lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> not classic Kirby action but still
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: It's a rip-off cast as twisted facts.
<Chrysalis> second hand is just a loss for anyone involved in making games
<alexxm> Nittany_Discord whats the point of these codes
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I hate that kind of shit. It's just like day 1 DLC as well. :S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That the used game market is evil.
<Lil_B> Michael cachi01 really only rumors...
<CCCP> am i the only one that REALLY liked kirby's Epic Yarn????
<Chrysalis> it IS evil
<Vordox> NewDCD: AWESOME! :D YOu live in US though and is it PS3?
<Michael> :(
<Saturn> 08,01well, i hope you all enjoyed that
<Chrysalis> the people who worked or funded the game get nothing
<TheRainbowDash> I surely did Saturn.:)
<Hat> Thanks Saturn
<NewDCD> 09,01don't live in US, getting a PS3 soon, as well as an arcade stick
<Lil_B> WiiU will probably support 2 Tablet controllers
<Chrysalis> while other people profit on their hardword
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And we should feel bad for buying used.
<Saturn> 08,01how's the qualityu?
<Nyria> That was good Saturn~
<Chrysalis> hardwork
<Somebronyyayz> i enjoyed
<Saturn> 08,01is it desync'd or anything?
<Princess_Molestia> Anypony want to ERP?
<Alchemist> Saturn: Sagan is always great. thanks :)
<DerpSurge> The end! Thanks Saturn!
<Airpuff> Saturn: Nah it was good
<MegaMoonShine> Saturn: Seems fine to me
<Ninjazz> So they force us to feel bad.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anyway, online passes are a way for publishers and developers to make money off of used games.
<Vordox> Saturn: Kinda stuttering to me, but it's doable
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which I think is wrong.
<cachi01> IT IS WRONG
<Chrysalis> and whats wrong with the people who made a game to make money off of it
<Ninjazz> I think it's unfair and unjustified.
<Princess_Molestia> I ment in a private chat
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Of course it is. Because there's *no damned regulation* in the games industry.
<Chrysalis> then where would the money come from
<Michael> wut
<Ray> 02Well
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: They already did in the initial sale.
<Michael> dat console
<cachi01> TARDIS!
<Ray> 02Since the LPW became a Meme train
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And game publishers are the only people to complain about used sales.
<Vordox> World Economy is crashing cause of Piracy :p
<Chrysalis> so they should just be ok with second hand stores making large profits off of their work
<RustyMeat> dat tardis
<Chrysalis> without getting anything backl
<Princess_Molestia> If anypony wants to, join #orgy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And punish people for buying used.
<Ray> 02I guess we're able to make it a doubles thread
<Ray> 02*shot*
<NewDCD> 09,01(here)
<Michael> omg
<Airpuff> lol dat room
<Derpyty> wtf?

<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I know. I didn't get punished for buying my 8 year old car, why the fuck do games companies get away with it. (I know, no regulation... :D)
*Ninjazz doesn't want to remember that
<MegaMoonShine> Princess_Molestia: Oh god why? :(

<RyunosukeKnT> its not the game industry that is bitching about used markets
<Vinyer> whee with having to buy food from somewhere just so i can take their wifi
<RustyMeat> dat baldness
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: No regulation like you said.
<Somebronyyayz> in brazil a Rainbow colored cloud appeared
<RyunosukeKnT> its the big publishers doing that

<Vinyer> hej
<Derpyty> lol
<Vinyer> h
<RustyMeat> what
<RustyMeat> that sound derp
<Alchemist> now the sound is stuttering big time
<RyunosukeKnT> to be quite honest, the gaming industry is suffering with the movie/music industry
<HyperMetalLugia> hi vinyer
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Airpuff> ... scary sound is scary o.o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, gamers that buy into the publishers argument and defend online passes. It's defending being ripped off.
<cachi01> he is staring at meeeeeeeeeeeee
<DerpSurge> Ummm the sound is horrible
<HyperMetalLugia> having fun with Win8
<Chrysalis> its not being ripped off
<DerpSurge> Now it's good
<Saturn> 08,01should be fixed now
<Chrysalis> its paying for what you use
<RustyMeat> dat rainbow center
<RyunosukeKnT> the big name publishers are saying the same things as RIAA/MPAA
<Chrysalis> if you dont want to pay, dont play
<Viri> 14I still can't fix the audio issue I'm having on Win7 :(
<Vinyer> good
<Airpuff> Saturn: its a bit choppy....
<Starflash> Good evening everypony~
<Saturn> 08,01btw, in case anyone is in any doubt: this is satire.
<cachi01> hi Starflash
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Starflash!
<Saturn> 08,01Airpuff: how about now?
<Nyria> Hey Starflash~
<Michael> hai Starflash
<Viri> 14o.o
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: People are stupid. :S
<MegaMoonShine> hi Starflash
<Renard> They just acknowledge that gamers are idiots, and that approach totally works.
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<HyperMetalLugia> Viri
*Starflash glomps Nyria
<Airpuff> Saturn: got better, :P
<Renard> Yay.
<HyperMetalLugia> driversdrivers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: Why should I have to pay for something that's part of the original game?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;Z
*Nyria hugs Starflash back~ ^^
<Viri> 14I downloaded several
<Viri> 14all same problem
<alexxm> hey Starflash hows your day been
<CK|Ded> Summary: Korean FTC authorities are investigating Blizzard for refusal to refund legal purchases of Diablo 3, and have seized computers, documents, etc to try to determine if Blizzard is breaking the law by doing so.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Taking a good game apart for greed purposes is wrong.
<the_real_pony_1604> yeah, little choppy for me as well. and video audio getting off
<HyperMetalLugia> aqww
<HyperMetalLugia> what is the problem.
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord because your not paying for the game, your paying for the disk
<HyperMetalLugia> ;3
<Starflash> alexxm pretty good, yours?
<CCCP> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5106/
<Viri> 14well
<Viri> 14the audio is normal
<Viri> 14but
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: And that's abused.
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Yet you don't actually own the disc either. :S
<Viri> 14when I watch a video on youtube, it's slightly distorted
<Viri> 14very slightly
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: Oh well Spiderman.
<Viri> 14it's still annoying
<HyperMetalLugia> go
<RyunosukeKnT> I dont mind special offers for say preordering from Gamestop or what not, ONLY, AND ONLY if it doest affect the story or adds serious plot elements to the game
<alexxm> i'm good Starflash going to show my dad mst3k today
<Chrysalis> GilDash you do, just not whats on it, only be allowed to use it
<HyperMetalLugia> rhr
<HyperMetalLugia> Did you
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: :3
<Chrysalis> you get a liscence for it
<Phase4> 02:34 :|
<Litwick> God damn it YT.
<HyperMetalLugia> turn off flash's hardware acceleration?
<Vinyer> HyperMetalLugia:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I only buy the disc, I'll just buy a blank floppy and copy the game.
<Viri> 14o.o
<Starflash> alexxm good idea xD
<RyunosukeKnT> see: ME3
<Viri> 14do I have to turn that off'
<Vinyer> i heard windows 8 was made by microsoft
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Better game for the cost of a disc.
<Viri> 14*?
<Vinyer> is this true?
<Alchemist> I hate mock interviews like that. I get that its a troll humour, but I dont like it.
<Airpuff> Nittany_Discord: i see the problem, but they might use it for maintaining the servers, and paying for them?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01As in, I get everything I bought with it.
<HyperMetalLugia> ..NOPE
<HyperMetalLugia> Made by apple
<HyperMetalLugia> ::
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Vinyer> oh
<RyunosukeKnT> Nit, my theory is, I bought the game with my money, it is mine to do with as I wish to do with it
<Vinyer> that explains a lot
<Vinyer> still
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> viri
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: i found it hilarious
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Airpuff: They maintained servers fine before online passes.
<Vinyer> it's not made by linux
<HyperMetalLugia> try rlgihtcligfkjgnf
<HyperMetalLugia> rightclicking
<Viri> 14try what
<Chrysalis> ill agree on-disk DLC is evil and those that do should be hung
<Viri> 14o.o
<Viri> 14ah
<HyperMetalLugia> on a youtube video
<Michael> dat buffer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And if they wanted server maintenance fees, they would do subscription fees.
<HyperMetalLugia> and then click settings
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not one-time codes.
<CCCP> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5085/ i don't know why this made me laugh
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Well, yes, you only own the plastic and foil. But without actually having *any* control over the software on it, you might as well say that you own nothing except an expensive frisbee.
<HyperMetalLugia> and make sure the hardware thing is not checked
<RyunosukeKnT> GilDash: I disagree
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Exactly. And people can always set their own servers up anyway.
<Airpuff> Nittany_Discord: .. ah.. i see.. im pretty against it myself.. but yeah..
<GilDash> RyunosukeKnT: Go and read the EULA and come back to me.
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm having the same problems with .swfs on here on Mint
<DerpSurge> This is so awkward :D
<Viri> 14it doesn't change
<Viri> 14:(
<Saturn> 08,01goddamn buffer shuffle...
<Hat> What is this show
<RyunosukeKnT> an anology is towards the automobile, you wouldnt steal a car, but if I buy a car, I can modify said car as I see fit and for my needs
<RaveBrony> Lollwut!? :D
<Saturn> 08,01Hat: it's a youtube vid
<alexxm> do these people know this is a joke
<cachi01> dat cereal wall
<HyperMetalLugia> try closing your browser?
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<MegaMoonShine> Wall of cereal!
<Luna> hmm?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RyunosukeKnT: You don't own the software. It's in the license agreement.
<HyperMetalLugia> What browser are you using?
<Vinyer> no
<Hat> Is it possible to request
<Saturn> 08,01called "The Gays: An Investigative Report"
<Chrysalis> Ryunosuke not to any extent, you have to abide by road laws
<RyunosukeKnT> I can change the engine, I can change the wheels, I can change the upholstery
<LordCelestia> ?mmh
<CCCP> Wait what is it about?
<CCCP> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5096/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You own a right to use it, but EULAs usually give the end company more rights than you do.
<valoreins> the stream sound derped..
<Phase4> localtime
<Airpuff> Saturn: .. these questions are quite harsh.. xD
<Alchemist> if you want to be raged just watch ANY video about the westboro baptist church.
<alexxm> i prefer austin 3:16
<Saturn> 08,01Airpuff: it's a satire
<GilDash> RyunosukeKnT: And you are legally allowed to do that. You can't with software. It's more analogous to *renting* a car when you "buy" a game.
<Luna> poor phase :(
<Chrysalis> and if you dont like it, dont accept the EULA and return it for a full refund
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like the right to terminate the license and force you to destroy your game copies.
<Viri> 14firefox
<Airpuff> Saturn: okei.. good xDD
<RaveBrony> I JUSt return to "God hates gays, What did you do to make him hate gays"
<Viri> 14nope, not going to change it xDD
<RaveBrony> :D
<RyunosukeKnT> Chrysalis: if I want to drive it on public highways yes, but I can in thieron to do anything AS LONG as I dont drive it
<Viri> 14IE and Chrome gives me the same problem anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> well then obviously it is FF's fault
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They can call you and tell you to turn your game over, and you can't do squat.
*HyperMetalLugia flee
<Viri> 14xD
<HyperMetalLugia> have you tried reinstalling flash?
<Chrysalis> and you CHOOSE to accept that
<RyunosukeKnT> *thieron = theory
<Chrysalis> if you want to you can just deny the EULA and return it
<RaveBrony> I keep lagging, brb
<Michael> 240 we meet again
<RyunosukeKnT> however the game industry does not give me that choice :)
<FlareChaser|TF2> dafuq are we watching?
<CCCP> wait wut is this?
<cachi01> 240p we meet again
<GilDash> Chrysalis: No you can't! You have to open the copy to get to view the EULA, and from that point you're fucked.
<cachi01> damn it Michael!
<FlareChaser> Nittany_Discord: dafuq is this?
<CCCP> lag is lagggg
<Michael> lulz
<Airpuff> 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01this is "The Gays: An Investigative Report"

<FlareChaser> Hello kirzstryfe ! place a dispenser there.
<Alchemist> Saturn: its kinda amazing how they interview subjects are not getting angry :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or digital downloads.
<valoreins> ohai kirzstryfe
<Vordox> Dem questions
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: gays love and tolerate too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So if you buy the game and disagree with the EULA, you're out whatever that game cost.
<RyunosukeKnT> and you cannot enforce a "you have to delete" theory
<alexxm> Alchemist they're probably in on it
<RustyMeat> Its called satire folks
<RyunosukeKnT> that is invasion of privacy, which most western countries kinda disdain on
<CCCP> take a bath?
<necroshadow123> hi everypony
<HyperMetalLugia> lolwut
<CCCP> hi necroshadow123
<Michael> hai necroshadow123
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RyunosukeKnT: Tell EA that.
<Alchemist> Saturn: I guessed so, but for most people much less would be enough to swing away.
<MegaMoonShine> Hi necroshadow123
<valoreins> ohai necroshadow123
<alexxm> hey necroshadow123 hows your day been
<HyperMetalLugia> that's stupid.

<HyperMetalLugia> > Chromium's doesn't
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And unless you can provide criminal evidence against EA, you can't take them to court over it.
<FlareChaser> Bronies that are gay are pretty nice people too, :) I was talking to one yesterday.

<RaveBrony> My gay friend was one of the most calm people i ever knew! Unless you said the 'f' word for gays around him o_o then no mercy will be shown...
<ScootaChicken> Oh wow, I haven't used the Flash chat in ages]
<Viri> 14nope :/
<HyperMetalLugia> though I have a feeling I messed that up by mistake somehow
<FlareChaser> Saturn: Scottish?! SPEAK!
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, you could always install Windows 8 RC
<ScootaChicken> It's so nostalgic ;___;
<Alchemist> :D
<Michael> lol
<Yahooz> Flash chat?
<ScootaChicken> All the pony smilies :')
<cachi01> just wait until EA gets a name with ''elder'' or ''scrolls'' on it and bethesda shoould do the rest

<DashWithRainbows> ScootaChicken 17 minutes until bed time young man.
<RyunosukeKnT> this is one reason I play MMOs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What needs to happen is that gamers need to stop buying the bullshit and stop compromising. Buying games with bad business practices in them hurts everyone but the publisher (dev) because those practices will continue and even worsen.
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: Go away :P
<Saturn> 08,01shoul be better now

<Obsidian> How is it going everypony?
<valoreins> but, why do ppl like to buy bullshit games?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If not, the industry will crash because legal games will become so unattractive that whatever price that's put on them won't be worth it.
<Michael> better :D thanks
<alexxm> i'm good Obsidian how about you

<Melonvolent> Gross... she's all naked and shit.
<Yahooz> Where was Gondor when suddenly Meanwhile
<LordCelestia> 0,5I bet you we won't be

<Lil_B> greetings Meanwhile
<Obsidian> Hello Meanwhile

<Airpuff> Hi Meanwhile

<StupidSexyCJ> GilDash: Next time GilDash, NEEEXT TIIEEMM!
<Phase4> kabaka should be online
<Irish_Pony> what in the world???
<cachi01> Lil_B: same ancestors?
<Alchemist> Lil_B: O.O that sucks. My uni has a power outage every year for maintenance reasosn but it is scheduled to avoid losses.
<valoreins> implying we are digimons
<Phase4> lightirc has an option iirc
<CCCP> DerpSurge: that would be soo amazing
*Wrek puts on SRS faic. lets do this!
<BallCrusher2000> PSYCHOTRIP!!!
<Herp_Derp> extremly interesting
<cachi01> im not a monkey
<Ghosties> 04STOP
<cachi01> im a pokemon!
<Ghosties> 04Alright
<BallCrusher2000> I'm going to catch you! =D
<valoreins> wat lvl?
<Herp_Derp> cachi01: what kind?
<Meanwhile> What a story Mark.
<cachi01> phsycic type!
*Michael throws a pokeball to cachi01
<Ghosties> 04Welcome everyone to the meeting, I hope you all have your game face on because we begin now
<Lil_B> Alchemist somebory pressed a button, with big letters "DO NOT PRESS!" and the NOT is the Button!
<cachi01> BallCrusher2000: run run as fast as you can! u cant catch me in the pokemon man!
<valoreins> fluttershy?!
<cachi01> im*
<Meanwhile> How old is this video? -_^
*Nittany_Discord 11,01presses pointless button.
*cachi01 eats pokeball
<necroshadow123> If you were turned into a pony right now what would your cutie mark be
<StupidSexyCJ> in other words, Trees are best ponies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*shrug*
<Michael> omg
<BallCrusher2000> cachi01: the hell? I'm a car, of course I can catch you!
<Hat> Fluttershy is graceful
<Ghosties> 04I'm going to start the meeting off, I hope you are ready. My opening and topic should only take about 10 minutes total, so I'll immediately begin: Communication, it's the majority topic that everyone has been discussing for this meeting and I feel the same
<valoreins> my cutie mark is a bamboo tablet pen
<Meanwhile> My cutie would be for procrastination, but it isn't here yet.
<cachi01> well im phsycic i just can fly and then u will ot be able to catch me!
<Lil_B> thats why we kill so many plats
<Obsidian> Fluttershy is not trivial!
<Lil_B> plants*
<Chrysalis> lol Meanwhile you have a lazy cutiemark?
<RustyMeat> Oh god the video doing weird things
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Meanwhile> It'll appear when it can be bothered.
<Herp_Derp> LAG
<Hat> The music is going off pitch making the plants seem weird
<Michael> dat souns
<CCCP> Meanwhile: haha
<Obsidian> Getting some bad lag here
<Lil_B> tell the DJ to stopp screing with the Tape
<RustyMeat> Oh lord
<Michael> sounds*
<cachi01> my cutie maaark would be something videogame music and fun related
<Meanwhile> Educational remix.
<Ghosties> 04However, I want to discuss the lack of communication that had been lingering between Team Leaders in the TL group; before last week it was hardly used because admins or departments would keep important bits of news or ideas concealed to their own departments or to SRS where it would get washed away amongst lighthearted chatter
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo :>
<RustyMeat> SCIENCE
<Herp_Derp> lol
<Meanwhile> E-e-e-e-e-e-evolu-lu-lu-lution
<RustyMeat> Hai SuperBrony64
<Vordox> Lil_B: LAWL! I thought of a DJ playing and DCing a Cassette Tape XD
<Lil_B> cachi01 mine would ba a N64 Controller
<CCCP> SuperBrony64: are you a cow?
<valoreins> wat have science done!?!!?!
<Ninjazz> When everyone wakes up, I get sleepy.
<Meanwhile> Planty buisness.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Lil_B: Hehe ^-^
<Alchemist> valoreins: more science?
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 has best moo
<valoreins> more lag
<Obsidian> we dddddddeeal about ooooooour busines
<SuperBrony64> 11,02My cutie mark is a Nintendo 64 controller :)
<cachi01> h-hhh-hello mr p-ppp-pppott-tt-tter
<valoreins> good for you SB :D
<Ghosties> 04So with that in mind we decided to reassess the situation there and we worked to make sure that any info or ideas we have is always communicated in the TL group so that way we all know what's going on and there's less chance of important things getting washed away
<Alchemist> valoreins: oh and instant soups with ramen. I love those too :)
<Ninjazz> Mine is one big diamond.
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64... then I choose the N64-Sign
<StupidSexyCJ> SuperBrony64 has best cutie mark
<BallCrusher2000> What going on with the video? O_o
*GilDash snuggles Ninjazz.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: We can be sleepy together. ;)
<Ninjazz> o_O
<valoreins> :s
<Vordox> My Cutiemark? Blank Flank
<Ninjazz> Sure. I'm getting tired.
*SuperBrony64 hugs Lil_B "We can both share the controller cutie mark :P"
<Hat> How do you determine cutie mark
*Lil_B points at Vordox "BLANK FLANK"
<Ghosties> 04But Team Leaders, please use the room more often. Anything that comes up for a department you should mention in the TL group so we can all see what's going on. Please.
*Vordox bucks Lil_B
*GilDash cuddles with Ninjazz.
<Alchemist> The video is headed for the event horizon and the time space continuum is starting to fall apart.
<cachi01> Hat: just something you really like
<Mish> what are watching?
<Ninjazz> :3
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is watching Mish
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 thanks X
<cachi01> Hat: and u r good at
<necroshadow123> my cutie mark would be fire
<Hat> My cutie mark would be FiM and would be awkward to explain to other ponies
<Alchemist> necroshadow123: pyromaniac?
<Vordox> ^ Hat Wins
<BallCrusher2000> And mine flank will be blank =(
<Ghosties> 04To also help with this communication, the admin team has decided on weekly "mini-meetings" meaning that once a week, preferrably Wednesday or something, the admin team talks to the TLs in the TL group and we recap and lightly discuss info that has come our way
<necroshadow123> Alchemist: i make fires very quickly and yes im a pyro
<cachi01> story of the blanks
<Lil_B> oh, my stream is totally desynced now
<Hat> Laag
<BallCrusher2000> Lil_B: mine too =(
<Vordox> Saturn: You ....err....The sound is ahead like...20 seconds
<Irish_Pony> BLOOD
<Hat> Ewwww bloooood
<Ghosties> 04We believe this will help facilitate better communication and less forgetting of ideas and info
<Alchemist> necroshadow: buring stuff is fun unless the stuff is alive :D
<GilDash> Meh, blood's fine. :)
<Mish> Science....
<Mish> YES
<Lil_B> animation!
<Ghosties> 04And yes, we are also listening to any ideas or suggestions the TLs or staff may have
<Ghosties> 04We, as in Admins
<Alchemist> oooh golgi apparatus
<BallCrusher2000> Blood is good for you
<necroshadow123> Alchemist: ive burnt a mouse that was alive
<Obsidian> How old is this?
<Alchemist> and filaments
<Alchemist> and rough endoplasmatic reticulum
<BallCrusher2000> necroshadow123: like... computer mouse?
<Lil_B> I probably shooldn't listen to this, because of how much the understanding of DNA has changed today
<Ghosties> 04For the team leaders, the admin team asks that you also conduct a mini session (meeting) with your own dept. once a week and then report back info for the weekly TL meeting
<GilDash> Alchemist: And ribosomes. ;)
<necroshadow123> BallCrusher2000: no live mousie mice
*Ninjazz is having trouble keeping his eyes open
<Michael> dem atoms
<Ghosties> 04Now
<Alchemist> gilDash: there were too much stuff on screen so I just gave up on naming more of them :D
<Ghosties> 04Some of you may have heard: Quote of the Day
*cachi01 throws bucket of cold water to Ninjazz
<BallCrusher2000> necroshadow123: Oh... suck to be mouse...
*StupidSexyCJ tapes Ninjazz's eyes open
<Ninjazz> O__O
*cachi01 slaps Ninjazz
<Ninjazz> O____O
<cachi01> WAKE UP
<Ninjazz> O______O
*Airpuff removes the tapes, and lies Ninjazz in a bed
<Ninjazz> :3
<necroshadow123> BallCrusher2000: they shouldent be eating my popcorn
<Lil_B> I NOW THE MUSIC! BACKS AIR!
*GilDash holds her hoof over Ninjazz's eyes and nuzzles him.
<Lil_B> Bachs Air*
*cachi01 throws a bucket of cold water to Airpuff and Ninjazz
<Ghosties> 04Sumi and I had been talking about a "Quote of the Day" function where people could draw various postings from the chat in BronyState and then either put them up in their own section or have them spotlighted on our home page or something. It's just an idea for now but it seems many have taken a liking to it
<necroshadow123> lol ive played this song on a violin
<Shizuka> 13Oi.
<Shizuka> 13Cut the RP.
<Shizuka> 13Now.
<Bronysith> hiya Shizuka
<Ninjazz> Hello Shizuka.
<Michael> hai Shizuka
<cachi01> goodbye RP!
<Ninjazz> Booth good and bad thing.
<Obsidian> Hello Shizuka
<Mish> Hey! For once Im not the cause of RP!
<cachi01> hi Shizuka!
<BallCrusher2000> necroshadow123: oh... yeah, that's just unforgivable. I think you should've smash it before you've burnt it.
<Ghosties> 04It's certainly something for the tech team that needs to be addressed on how to implement it. Shizuka believes it can be done, it's just a matter of how we do it
<Mish> >;3
<Ghosties> 04Alruight, BronyCon
<Ninjazz> One, I stopped being beaeted to hell and the other I get to sleep alone. :3
<Chrysalis> hiya Shizuka
<Ghosties> 04*Alright
<Alchemist> Wow, this animation IS old...
<Meanwhile> It's so old your mum saw it in school.
<Mish> AWESOME powers
<Ghosties> 04As you may know, we were contacted by one of the con organizers to be at BronyCon
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Don't count on it. :D
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: .. not bad. xD
<Saturn> 08,01er, sound desynced?
<Ghosties> 04After negotiations, we were able to get tickets and a room for BronyState
<necroshadow123> BallCrusher2000: i picked it up (still on fire) and threw it on cement as hard as i could
<BallCrusher2000> Meanwhile: I've seen it in my school. In RUSSIA, DAMN IT!
<Alchemist> Meanwhile: a bit newer than that. unless its from the 60's
<Meanwhile> BallCrusher2000: That is immensely old.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I never count on anything these days. =__=
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: Both good... and bad.
<Mish> oh MY~
<cachi01> my oh
<Meanwhile> Whatever happened to people just going "Aww shit son" When people make your mum jokes?
<Michael> :=
<Mish> O_O
<Michael> :O
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: Bad? :O Who would've thought
<BallCrusher2000> necroshadow123: Good. Then its live wasn't so bad at all.
<Saturn> 08,01is that about where it was?
<Lil_B> I heard "Shit"
<Mish> sSlightly more forward
<Alchemist> Meanwhile: if that was a joke it failed miserably :D
<Lil_B> Saturn after the DNA Assebling
<Mish> We weree at "Blood"
<Ghosties> 04I sent him an email and we did get a response back on hotel room info. We have the room from 6/29 - 7/1
<Meanwhile> Alchemist: Apparently so.
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: Didn't you see me getting mistreated? :<
<Mish> :) sciences
<Ghosties> 04No news on hotel room number yet
<necroshadow123> BallCrusher2000: it was a bit living so i crushed its head wit my foot
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: No one cares.
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: Nay, did not? o.o
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile: I wasn't talking to you.
<Mish> Ninjazz Are u ok?
<Airpuff> Meanwhile: well i do, so you're wrong :)
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: I know. Just throwin' it out there.
<Ninjazz> Mish: Now i am.
<Meanwhile> Airpuff: You don't count as a person.
<BallCrusher2000> necroshadow123: Shhh! Nobody should hear it. Or we will be taken to police
<Mish> :) good
<Airpuff> Meanwhile: ahahaha okei
<Bronysith> we are bronies
<cachi01> asdf movie 6
<Bronysith> bronies are 20% cooler than people
<Ponies47> ^
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile: Never change, do you? :|
<cachi01> ^^
<Ghosties> 04As far as we know Nittany, Slurry, Scoot, fluttercry, and SuperBrony64 are going with Super leading the team, however, there is a possibility I may go but it's not looking that way. I can't afford the money right now, so I'll have Super go in my stead to watch after the team.
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: Eenope.
<Airpuff> Bronysith: indeed.
<Ponies47> So true Bronysith :)
<Michael> Bronysith: eeyup
<Ghosties> 04We won't have a booth or a presentation of any sort, but we will be in the Con booklet
<Bronysith> PIERCE THE HEAVENS with you brohoof
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Nice to see you're your usually happy self. :D
<Ghosties> 04Just enjoy yourselves, but most importantly BE SAFE
<Mish> "bleed to death with the smallest scrach", discription of a horrid disease that causes humans to YES bleed to death at the smallest cut
<Bronysith> WHO DA HAY do you think we are
<Ponies47> Poeple (like my brother) are not ready to become true men.
<Ghosties> 04And that's all I have for me, for now.
<Airpuff> GilDash: your irony amuses me. xD
<Luna> get to know other ponies, maybe discover some possible partners
<necroshadow123> BallCrusher2000: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl44-vXeE60
<Caramel> one additional about Bronycon
<Wrek> 05(and take images, lots of images)
<Meanwhile> Hey I'm very happy, I'm watching a vid of some guy falling down stairs right now.
<Meanwhile> It's hilarious.
<Bronysith> i got my brony shirt today. i am a happy pony!
<Caramel> we wont be streaming it
<cachi01> Mish: the brother of princess anastasia had that disiease
<Lil_B> I feaking love this song
<Ghosties> 04Oh, and uh, one other thing. Because I don't see it here...
<Ghosties> 04Streaming
<Caramel> but if the attendees want to do some sort of recording or something
<Shizuka> 13streaming is on the list ghosties
<Silverscreen> 1,11What'd I miss?
<Caramel> then talk to the admins about it
<Vordox> Saturn: Sound desynched again...same as before
<Ponies47> Bronysith: YAY! I gotta get me some pony T-shirts.
<BallCrusher2000> DAmn it! My stream is desynched =(
<Luna> @Silver ghosties intro
<Michael> Bronysith: u lucky :)
*Airpuff brohoofs Bronysith
<Ghosties> 04Then I passed it over because I really don't see it
<Airpuff> Epic
<Ghosties> 04But
<Luna> don't worry there will be logs
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Oh you. :D
<Bronysith> http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/brony-shirt-306102498?q=gallery%3Abronysith&qo=0
<Lil_B> Bronysith whats on the shirt?
<Ponies47> THE POWER OF BROFOOFS! /)
<Ghosties> 04Anyways, we're going to be redoing the streaming format for non-official streams
<Ghosties> 04Here are the following new rules for the stream
<Ponies47> *Brohoofs
<Meanwhile> Ponies47: EPIC BROHOOOOOF (\
<Bronysith> theres me in my shirt
<Airpuff> Meanwhile: seen on the botom of the ocean? The ending there has the most "hillarious" way of saying hillarious.. xD
<CCCP> then who was brony?
<Saturn> 08,01also, he posted a video link.
<Chrysalis> oh Saturn
<Mish> In "birthmarked", this desiase was ravaging in most of the population(its gentic; they needed more outsider breeding) well most of the wallled-in enclave
<Bronysith> um no Saturn its a pic link man
<Bronysith> well the one i poseted
<Meanwhile> I do not want to click that link given the kick description... >_>
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: not you
<Ponies47> Saturn: What happened?
<Ghosties> 043 hours max, no double stacking (as in, no double backing on your stream), you may only stream twice 24 hours, and you have five minutes to wrap your stream up if there is someone else in queue
<Bronysith> Saturn: ooooh righto. tea?
<Saturn> 08,01Ponies47: he was describing how he set fire to, then crushed with his foot, a live mouse
<Mish> :) I got my frist bronyshirt awhile ago
<Alchemist> we are identical to fluttershy?
<Mish> and then people said I can't wear it :(
<Saturn> 08,01what an utterly horrible human being
<CCCP> i just met a brony on omegle
<Ponies47> Saturn: :o
<pony_9622> who is this pedophile?
<cachi01> Saturn: who de fuck did that O_o
<Mish> So i switched to the pinkie pie "IS WATCHING YOU" shirt
<Sundaysmile> I'd like to be a tree...
<pony_9622> yay
<Saturn> 08,01cachi01: necroshadow123
<Ponies47> CCCP: I goes on Omegle all the time and ask poeple if they watch ponies :P
<cachi01> O_O
<Mish> at the gala....at the gala.....
<cachi01> dats horriblle
<pony_9622> :]
<pony_9622> :[
<Obsidian> Glad i missed that
<Lil_B> so... we are Ponys?
<Alchemist> Saturn: hopefully just a troll...
<CCCP> Ponies47: yay /)
<Mish> Ponies R infectious
<Ponies47> CCCP: (\
<Bronysith> Alchemist: trololol
<Airpuff> Mish: indeed -.-
<Michael> Saturn: that's cruel, poor mouse :[
<Lil_B> Show the Metropolis theme........
<BallCrusher2000> I'll go eat something.
<Mish> OH DAT INTENSE FACE
<Ponies47> Dats just sick what necroshadow123 did :O
<Ghosties> 04Admin team are working on creating a bot/script to get a stream clock going for streaming: at an hour remaining you will be notified, at 30 minutes remaining you will be notified, and then at 5 minutes prior you will be asked to clean up. You will have five minutes passed the three hour mark to finish up your stream if there is someone else in line.
<Lil_B> Bronysith is it ok if i add you as a friend on DA?
<Mish> SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
<Ghosties> 04If there is no one else in the queue, you may continue streaming for as long as you want
<Bronysith> Lil_B: sure! :)
<Ghosties> 04But as soon as someone else calls for queue, you will have fifteen minutes to clean up
<cachi01> i wonder if this movie has fanservice
<Ghosties> 04There will be infractions for breaking the streaming
<cachi01> someone will have to speak sooner or later
<Mish> time for the lecture on the enviorment
<Ghosties> 04Infractions occur when you don't leave the stream even after you've been given your five or fifteen minute grace period
<Mish> But at least it isnt compltetly blamming...MAN?!?!
<Ghosties> 04(There are still be discussed, but these are the infractions planned for now)
<Lil_B> this guy really doens't like safty mesures
<Airpuff> Dat lightning
<Bronysith> cachi01: blah
<Dark_Horst> IT'S ALIVE!
<GilDash> It turned inside out and exploded. :O
<Alchemist> Lil_B: to be honest most professors tend to dismiss saftey protocols, and some times I agree with that.
<Ghosties> 04First infraction is a week ban from streaming, second infraction is no streaming until you've explained yourself adaquately and thoroughly to the rest of the team on why you decided to go past your grace period again. And, finally, permabanned from streaming
<Lil_B> Alchemist Me too, Some things are a little bit too strikt and unneccesary
<Meanwhile> I looked away for like ten minutes and now there's a big onion covered in bike clips on the screen.
<Meanwhile> Do I want to know why?
<Ghosties> 04Okay, NOW, that's all I have
<Airpuff> Meanwhile: cool isnt it? :D
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Probably not. :D
<Alchemist> for example: here you cant have gas canisters in the lab unless there is some apparatus on them.
<Meanwhile> Alright then.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01First infraction violation seems harsh.
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile: What?...
<Ninjazz> :D
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: buddy of him made prehistoric earth-jizz
<CCCP> bye
<Shizuka> 13would rather we use a skype group for streaming to keep better tabs on who is up and in queue
<Phase4> ^ nitt
<Shizuka> 13as is the requests get lost in SRS
<Silverscreen> 1,11I think first and second infractions should be switched.
<Dark_Horst> it's in that bottle
<Lil_B> CCCP bye :(
<Biglaw> bye CCCP!
<Meanwhile> "Prehistoric earth-jizz"
<Mish> MAN. YES MAN. HUMAN IN SHAPE BUT SATANIC IN SPRIT. THEY STEP ON YOR HOMES, RAPE DOGGIES, AND KICK BABIES. IF YOU EVER SEE ONE OF THESE CEATURES, CONTACT YOU SHOTTY MOVIE MAKING STUDIO IMMETALY AND MAKE BAD, RETARED ENVIORMENTAL FILMS noW.
<Meanwhile> Well that explains it.
<Oujo> ^
<Biglaw> waog
<Michael> bye CCCP
<Ninjazz> Cya CCCP.
<Om> latter CCCP
<Shizuka> 13the infractions just make it sound like you don't trust us
<Caramel> Shizuka: We do have a solution for that, which will be mentioned later in the meeting
<Lil_B> Mish dem Caps
<Meanwhile> Dat wall of caps.
<Ninjazz> Hello Om.
*Biglaw hugs CCCP
<Bronysith> Mish: bye
<Cobellanez> Hello everyone!
<Airpuff> Bye CCCP
<Mish> I dislike aps
<Bronysith> hiya Cobellanez
<kirzstryfe> I think the larger issue with streaming etiquitte is that people do not ask for time to stream, and the current rules aren't being enforced
<Ninjazz> Hello Cobellanez.
<LordCelestia> 0,5They do
<Ponies47> By bye CCCP :(
<Mish> Bye Brony?
<Obsidian> Hi Cobellanez
<Alchemist> but the profs hate carriyng canisters back and forth, so they just slap a gas bubbler on the canister to say they are testing if the canister leaks, and thats legal :)
<valoreins> oh bai CCCP
<Lil_B> YES there could be
<Mish> By mah CCCP
<Michael> hai Cobellanez
<Shizuka> 13and last, 3 hours max or else bad things happen, but if no one else is up you can go forever
<Shizuka> 13these two conflict
<theSHHAS> hello bronies!

<Lil_B> hi theSHHAS
<Michael> hai theSHHAS
<Ninjazz> Hello theSHHAS.

<Ninjazz> Om: Ji to you too, mate. :)
<Mish> HEELRO T\theSHHAS
<Ghosties> 04If there isn't someone in queue then you can continue streaming past three hours
<Shizuka> 13we have five minutes to wrap up or we have fifteen
<Mish> O_O
<theSHHAS> yay! i made a cool wallpaper today. check out my page http://theshhas.deviantart.com/#/d5294o6
<Nittany_Discord> 11,015 for someone in queue, 15 if not.
<Bronysith> theSHHAS: would u like to be part of the brony fukireta parade?
<LordCelestia> 0,5^I wondered that too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01From what I gather.
<Silverscreen> 1,11You have a time limit so long as there's other people wanting to stream. But why force them to stop streaming when there's nobody to go up after thm.
<Mish> Hunters OHSHET
<Phase4> i'm not seeing a need for these to be hard rules right now, people vacate the stream when someone else shows up
<Lil_B> wee also have Spitters, Hunters, Boomers, Smokers, and Tanks
<Ghosties> 04Five minutes if there was already someone in queue, fifteen if there wasn't and you continued streaming past three hours
<Om> GilDash: To early for rarity faces -_-
<Alchemist> :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02No they don't, if no-one else is in the queue, you can keep streaming. No reason to keep the stream empty if someone wishes to stream. But everyone should be able to stream if they want to and three hours is more than enough time for that to happen.
<Shizuka> 13[12:37] [+Shizuka] the infractions just make it sound like you don't trust us
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey Om :)
<theSHHAS> whats the brony fukireta parade?
<Michael> hai Om
<Ghosties> 04That's because we really want to cut down on frequently long streaming with people going on for hours and hours
<Ninjazz> Yo, Om, I appreciate you telling me you're leaving but stay for 10 damn seconds so I can say good bye. :D
<GilDash> Om: Not for me it isn't. ;)
<Silverscreen> 1,11That's why I said to switch the 1st and second infractions.
<Shizuka> 13as it is, we tend to let people go on because they're streaming good stuff
<Om> GilDash: Meh
<Ghosties> 04And we recognize that most people don't want to say anything to the person streaming
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They go on for hours when no-one else is streaming.
<Silverscreen> 1,11If you can explain yourself the first time, it shows we trust you, but we're conserned about ettiquette.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In queue.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Infractions are the cold justice to breaking those rules. They are there to be fair for everyone, if you break them, you're not being fair to everyone else. As long as you follow those rules, you should be fine.
<Mish> magics
<Om> Ninjazz: I told you I was going.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've never known anyone to hog the stream.
<GilDash> Om: Stick around a little so you can hear us say goodbye though... ;)
<Ninjazz> Om: You didn't wait for my farewell. :(
<NewDCD> 09,01personally, I think we've had a pretty big problem
<Airpuff> Ooo Om ! Hai
<Mish> Ninjazz dissaproves of your statement OM
<NewDCD> 09,01I mean
<Silverscreen> 1,11What SuperBrony64 said.
<NewDCD> 09,01if someone else is streaming
<Mish> yeah. you told us moments ago sir
<Mish> :3
<cachi01> theSHHAS: search on youtube for fukireta dance
<NewDCD> 09,01and we've asked to follow on the queue, and they keep streaming...who of us has the heart to tell them "hey, it's my turn now"
<Om> Ninjazz: I'm sure it was a lovely and heartfelf goodbye.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not against infractions.
<Phase4> worse comes to worse, we have the embed switcher
<Om> GilDash: I didn't feel like it.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That too
<Mish> Bye OMNOMNOM
<GilDash> Om: Aw, what's wrong? :)
<Mish> :)
<Ninjazz> Om: Alright, man. I'll back off for now.
<Alchemist> I realized that I cant study if Im on here... I read several pages but I have no idea what it was :D
<Shizuka> 13and nearly everyong has access to it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can we set up the stream sharing again?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't.
<Litwick> Take a look! It's in a book! reading rainbow!
<Luna> Actually we have a different idea too, which we will mention in a bit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have access to embed switching.
<Airpuff> ... Hi... Om ....
<NewDCD> 09,01I don't think the infractions will actually be enforced because I don't think anybody will break the rules once we set up a good system, as you are all reliable people, but every law or rule needs to have a consequence, regardless
<Mish> Furryeh Babieshs
<Mish> FFFRRRRGHHH
<Om> Well right now I'm tired.
<Shizuka> 13everyone does now
<Mish> no more SCIENCES?
<Herp_Derp> science time is over? D:
<Sumica> 00,10In all honistly the infractions irk me. You want to issue punishments on somthing people do with there spare time as a service.
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, its on the site, wp-admin->settings->embed switcher
<Mish> D:
<Airpuff> Om: Bastard stop ignoring me! xDD
<Michael> MOAR science
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I looked there and couldn't find it.
<Silverscreen> 1,11DCD, we all have it in us to tell someone to step down. We do it all the time for bans and such.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll see again.
<Phase4> huh
<Mish> :[ MORE SCIENCES
<Alchemist> Now onto literature, grammar and history :D
<Ghosties> 04It's to make sure everyone gets a fair chance, Sumica
<Meanwhile> What a story science guy.
<Mish> HISTORY?
<Ninjazz> I'm tired too. Hell, exhausted even.
<Mish> YAY
<cachi01> TARDIS!
<Bronysith> WHO IS streaming right now?
<NewDCD> 09,01I've seen it a ton of times, and I have experienced it myself
<Mish> I see your email
<Wrek> 05i am sceptical on how the stream queues works. a steamer might well be unable to constantly watch is someone asks in SRS for a stream spot. so unless there's a proper way to build a queue, that is actually delivered to the streamer at hand. most of the times I dont even know there's a queue cause no one pings me in IRC which basically is the only medium im able to check during sessions.
<Michael> saturn
<Wrek> 5Secondly I have never noticed someone occupying the stream. 80% of the time no one is on queue and the few times there is when people actualyl tell me that "hey there is a queue and im up next, ETA?" i have always gone "sure ill wrap up, 10ish minutes ok for you?"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sumica: It's meant to be fair for everyone else. If we don't have them in place, then what's the repercusion for going over the limit?
<Ninjazz> Saturn, right?
<Om> Ninjazz: Its late for you,so I would expect that.
<Mish> :>
<NewDCD> 09,01you want to stream, but someone who has been streaming the whole day is still streaming and you honestly don't have the heart to tell them you want to stream
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just asking the others if they want to take over
*Airpuff throws apples at Om in rage
<Sumica> 00,10we have had the time limit in place for months. no one uses it.
<NewDCD> 09,01it's just a way to ensure everybody gets their chance
<Michael> lol
<NewDCD> 09,01Sumica, that's the thing
<Ninjazz> Om: Yeah, I get screwed over with all the timezone shinanigans.
<valoreins> suddenly apples
<Mish> Saturn, I think they will steal yer emails
<NewDCD> 09,01nobody uses it because nobody has the HEART to do so
<Mish> Hide dem :(
<Ghosties> 04Nobody wants to tell someone else to stop streaming
<Alchemist> a Stephen Hawking biography, maybe? ;)
<NewDCD> 09,01I know I certainly don't
<Mish> OooooOOO!
<NewDCD> 09,01even if there are several times I should have, for all extents and purposes
<Sumica> 00,10So we are punishing because we are nice. Great logic
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sumica: Which is why we're making a big focus this time around and with rules in place. This is going to be the guideline from now on.
<Mish> ;) I love school
<Oujo> Hm...Would that be falling into the public not wanting the certain stream to stop?
<Herp_Derp> OH DEAR GOD NO
<Michael> wat
<StupidSexyCJ> So much green
<Obsidian> dat music
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Found it!
<Mish> LOL
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Om> Ninjazz: Sure you wana use that term? But yes, timezones get hecticly abundant
<Wrek> 05Oujo brings a valid point.
<Airpuff> .... Okei Om .. i wont feed ya anymore you annoying.. .... ... DUCK!!
<Shizuka> 13like i said we generally stay quiet cause what's on stream is awesome
<Ghosties> 04It's not punishing, it's too ensure everyone gets a chance to stream
<Michael> dat intermission
<cachi01> still alive would fit with this
<Obsidian> dat Shakespeare
<Meanwhile> Kill ALL the lawyers.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^
<Mish> Lol
<Herp_Derp> cachi01: I agree
<NewDCD> 09,01basically that's why we're trying to set up a platform that measures everyone can keep an eye on the time limit
<mario_pony> lol
<Phase4> "<Ghosties> Nobody wants to tell someone else to stop streaming" i think thats the choice here
<NewDCD> 09,01and not go overboard
<Mish> DUCK?
<Mish> WHERE?
<NewDCD> 09,01I mean
<Lil_B> except Phoenix Wright
<valoreins> OBJECTION
<Om> Airpuff: Your the one that told me not to respond to you.
<NewDCD> 09,01let's face it
<Ninjazz> Om: Well... Somehow I see everyone off somehow. And yes I will use that term. :>
<Shizuka> 13skype group for streamers, and only for stream related things
<Phase4> either we regulate each other or we enforce rules
<Lil_B> the "Truth"
<NewDCD> 09,01when we are streaming, we DO tend to lose track of time
<Airpuff> Om: >.> Annoying bastard..
<cachi01> kill ALL the lawyers... except for pheonix
<Ghosties> 04^
*Michael contributes
<Om> Ninjazz: Brave soul.
*GilDash hugs Om.
<Phase4> ^ NewDCD
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Which is where the bot takes over.
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: That's my word, bastard! :D
<Oujo> Mhm.
<Ghosties> 04That does tend to happen, it happened a bit even before the new year
<Caramel> Shizu: I don't want to get ahead of the schedule, but later on we're discussing having a stream department
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It will help keep track of the time
<Mish> <_< >_> DisApplle> Nothing is wrong!
<Ninjazz> DAT MUSIC!
<cachi01> kilaal mplayer?
<Airpuff> Om: I hate you, but i dont want to be ignored! xD
<Ninjazz> Damn.
<Obsidian> aww it ended
<NewDCD> 09,01a time measurement program/application/whatever would be the best way to keep an ey eon it
<mario_pony> this seems really complicated
<Alchemist> Now this just seems like a semi conscius skynet waking up :D
<Om> Airpuff: Then don't give me the option.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I need a timer for my bans.
<Airpuff> Om: OKei, you are to reply to my messages from so on!
<Herp_Derp> SCIENCE!
<Michael> MOAR science
<Michael> :D
<Mish> Bans?
<Meanwhile> Skynet if skynet didn't want to rule the earth and just wanted to show you Cosmos.
<cachi01> COSMOOOOOOOOOOOOOS
<Obsidian> More Science
<NewDCD> 09,01I mean
<Airpuff> Om: from now on*
<Bronysith> space?
<Om> Airpuff: Maybe.
<Silverscreen> 1,11It's not punishment if they follow the rules. It's ensuring everyone gets equal opportunity to stream. It's only going into punishment if the streamers refuse to acknowledge our rules. Wrek brings up a good point as well. On-the-fly queues can be a tricky thing, and could become difficult to control unless there's at least one person on it all the time.
<Bronysith> space?
<Mish> I van do that 4 u Nittany_Discord
<Bronysith> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<NewDCD> 09,01are there any other ideas as to how to make sure we don't go overboard?
<Wrek> 05It seems like theo nly reason we are wantign to eforce these new rules are becasue no one got the balls to ask the current streamer "hey id like to stream, any chance you could be done soon/got an ETA?" as far as i remember DCD has only asked me once that "hey there's a queue, id liek to stream" i mean how hard is it to just ask? dont have the heart? then the problem isnt with the streamer.
<Oujo> All right. I'm warming up to this, but what still bothers me is possible drama from the audience...The fact that potentially really good streams may have to be stopped, people would be a bit annoyed no?
<Mish> Since yer one of my fav. Mods
<Michael> science is best distraction
<Herp_Derp> ^.^ oh how i love the science
<Airpuff> Om: Okei.. its better than total ignorance. Thanks Om
*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord.
<NewDCD> 09,01harder than you'd think, Wrek
<NewDCD> 09,01much harder.
<Mish> Scienes
<Bronysith> Michael: OBJECTION mlp is best distraction
<SilverSonic> ;w; you both go away as soon as i was ready for my preshow
<Alchemist> alright, Im alt tabbing back to Diablo 2 for a while.
<Oujo> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01People ask me for the stream. SB has done it. I think Sumica has as well.
<Mish> Rainbowdash- OBJECTION!
<NewDCD> 09,01that one time I asked you
<Michael> Bronysith: oops its true :O
<NewDCD> 09,01well, I asked you like two hours after I was supposed to, ya know
<Michael> my fault
<NewDCD> 09,01it's hard, very hard, because you don't want to ruin other people's fun
<Om> I almost just want to go back to bed. -___-
<Saturn> 08,01actually, i disagree with you there, wrek
<NewDCD> 09,01makes you feel like a dick.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Meanwhile
<Silverscreen> 1,11Ouju: If a streamer is THAT good at what they do, hell, we could consider inviting them to be a part of bronystate or at least ask them to do a regular streaming for us. Problem solved.
<Airpuff> Om: can you go back to sleep without any problems then? :O
<Saturn> 08,01it seems that the times when i want to stream are the times when there are 2 or 3 queued
<BallCrusher2000> Okay, I'm back. And...oh god, it's Cosmos now...
<Ninjazz> Om: Making me tired.
<Mish> if you guys want best distraiction, I suggjest the amazing well written and animated MLP FIM mystery/court incounter beetween ponies and phonixe wright
<Michael> Wb BallCrusher2000
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai BallCrusher2000
<Phase4> kinda what i said before. either we do tell each other to stop, or we have rules do it
<Mish> ;)
<Saturn> 08,01also, it's sometimes hard to get a definite answer as to who is streaming, and who is curerntly in the queue
<kirzstryfe> this seems to be more of an issue of people not stepping up and asking than something that needs to be addressed with a full rules change
<Oujo> Silverscreen: Ah, all right then.
<Seastallion_of_War> What about Mars/Ares?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Exactly, Phase4
<cachi01> Mish: u mean turnabout storm?
<Seastallion_of_War> WAR!
<Mish> yus!
<Obsidian> Well I gotta go to work now. Bye Everypony!
<cachi01> Mish: yeah its awesome
<Phase4> i'd kinda prefer the former
<Michael> omg
<Om> Airpuff: Yeah, aint that hard.
<Seastallion_of_War> THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ME!
<BallCrusher2000> Hmmm... how do I change my nickname?
<Shizuka> 13k cutting that train here, val's segment discusses a streaming department, which my idea of a skype group falls under
<Ninjazz> Cya Obsidian! Take care, man.
<Michael> sun eating moon?
<Bronysith> BallCrusher2000: /nick
<Om> Ninjazz: Not my problem its nighttime there
<Airpuff> Om: no reason not to then? :P
<Michael> bye Obsidian
<cachi01> BallCrusher2000: type /nick (isert username here)
<Shizuka> 13we are 40 minutes into the meeting, need to move on and soon
<BallCrusher2000> Bronysith: thx
<NewDCD> 09,01I mean, if we could somehow automate the whole queue system, infractions may not be needed...buuuuuuuuuuut I doubt that's feasible, so we'll have to go with alternative 2, as Phase4 said
<GilDash> Om: http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw178_1308491058_furseiseki_lunadontgotobed.png
<Seastallion_of_War> I need more nomz
<Ninjazz> Om: Really? What time is it there?
<Airpuff> Om: if you're tired
<Saturn> 08,01i've fallen foul of this once, when one person told me the queue was empty, i started streaming, then got a "hey, i was going to take over, you bitch" (in politer words) from someone else
<Ghosties> 04Listen, we can discuss this later
<Mish> And the other one, which is ponies and...
<Ghosties> 04When Val is talking
<Wrek> 05in fact I urge people to ask me when i stream. that way i 1: know there's a queue and people are waiting for me and 2: it gets easier for me to plan out. "oh someone is on queue. then ill jstu reach next savepoitn and say goodbye"
<Airpuff> lol GilDash xD
<Ghosties> 04Guys
<Ghosties> 04Guys
<Mish> crap I forgot the name
<Ghosties> 04Please
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I agree with Shizuka that we should have a Skype group specific to streamers.
<Bronysith|KoToR> if anypony needs me... im killing evil sith
<Om> GilDash: >.>
<Ghosties> 04We need to get underway
<GilDash> Om: :)
<Ghosties> 04We need to continue
<LordCelestia> 0,5Thank you. -_-
<Ghosties> 04So
<Ghosties> 04Save your concerns for now
<Airpuff> GilDash: That picture somehow reminded me about Saturn .. xD
*Mish loads the orbital friendship cannon
*Saturn 08,01groans... "not more skype groups..."
<Om> I'm "I just woke up tired"
<Ghosties> 04Let's move on to Fluttercry
<Silverscreen> 1,11We got the basics of that issue down. We can discuss it further later. Moving on to the next topic now.
<NewDCD> 09,01Wrek: even if you do, it's not easy for anyone. Trust me on this one. And anyways, let's move along
<Mish> Need help Bronysith?
<Phase4> needs more skype groups
<Seastallion_of_War> What are we watching?
<fluttercry> 05,15Okay two points here
<Phase4> 00,02colour on!
*Ghosties sighs
<Mish> you dont need to kill....YOU CAN GIVE TEH FRIENDSHIPS
<Bronysith|KoToR> Mish: nah its not online
<Junker-Kun> Seastallion_of_War: Cosmos
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Please everyone, stay focused.
<Silverscreen> 1,11I agree with Saturn. We don't need anymore skype groups. It's hard enough to keep up with the three we have as it is.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Let fluttercry speak!
<GilDash> Om: And now you won't doze off again, you can party with the good denizens here. :)
<Mish> Bronysith|KoToR: you have to hug him to death
<Silverscreen> 1,11sorry.
<fluttercry> 05,15Guys. I don't want to be rude but, it's my turn to speak
<valoreins> i really want to watch more of these science... but i need to sleep now
<Michael> derp chat
<Junker-Kun> Aaaaaaand... it's desynched again. What the hell?
<Om> GilDash: I don't party.
<Mish> rub yer pony dolls all over him
<valoreins> bye everypony! :D
<fluttercry> 05,15A lot of people do complain that we don’t show enough ponies, and for a brony site, we probably don’t show as much as expected. Personally I’m okay with that, but we have to remember who most of our viewers are no. So my idea is that when it gets closer to season 3, we could start showing mini marathons of pony episodes, no more than 4 or 5 episodes. That way, people would be
<fluttercry> 5,15getting their pony fix, but it wouldn’t take that much time away from what other people want to stream. The marathons could even have a theme based on pony or whatever else people think of.
<GilDash> Om: Interact then. :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MOVING ON
<GilDash> valoreins: See ya! :)
<StupidCosmicCJ> Bai valoreins
<Pajaro> what exactly is this?
<Om> GilDash: You are asking too much.
<Bronysith|KoToR> valoreins: see ya
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: oH.
<Junker-Kun> Bye!
<Michael> bye valoreins
<Mish> Om: PINKIE PIE IS NOT PLEASED :[
<Airpuff> Bye valoreins :)
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nvm.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Please Nittany_Discord, wait your turn to speak.
<Princess_Molestia> Im back and im srry.
<Mish> But Im ok with it...sorry... :(
<Ninjazz> CYa Val... DAmn.
<Mish> Molestia....
<Mish> OH DAMN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't see that everyone had calmed down. Sorry.
<Michael> Wb Princess_Molestia
<Om> Mish: Pinkie Pike can drag my carcas to a party if she wants. Otherwize no.
<Ghosties> 04Listen
<GilDash> Om: Well, I'm not, because you're doing it. :)
<Airpuff> Mish: .. does Pinkie Pie have a part in the party at all then? xD
<Ninjazz> Om: PINKIE PIKE?! :D
<Caramel> if we want to organize a marathon, that's fine. Discuss it in the TL group and we'll get it rolling from there
<Ghosties> 04We'll discuss this *later* when Val mentions the streaming agin
<Ghosties> 04Please
<Ghosties> 04We need to move on
<Om> Ninjazz: I know what I said.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Wow. :D
<Pajaro> ok, i'm gonna come back later... :P
<Caramel> we already have -_-
<fluttercry> 05,15Then for my second topic, I know we’ve talked about trilogy month (or months) in the past but I don’t think most of us know the full detail of how that’s going to work. So what I’m asking for is what movies are we showing, when are we showing them, how are we picking the movies, and who’s streaming them. I’d like to have everything planned out in advance so it doesn’t
<fluttercry> 5,15end up like the anniversary with a small number of people scrambling to make everything correct by the deadline.
<Ninjazz> Uhhhh, Om.
<Ninjazz> You silly, bro. :D
<Om> GilDash: Witch >.>
<Saturn> 08,01btw, i'm still around, just not in this chat much right now. if the stream is derping, you can grab my attention by pinging me or pming me
<GilDash> Ninjazz: So *that's* how she gets all those ponies to a party. :D
<Ninjazz> Will do, Saturn.
<PinkiePry> Ah, good to be back. :)
<GilDash> Om: Eh, heretic maybe. ;)
<Airpuff> Sure Saturn
<Princess_Molestia> soooooo........wazzap?
<Michael> hai PinkiePry
<Shizuka> 13to my knowledge sumica volunteered to run Alien this week
<Junker-Kun> http://junker-kun.deviantart.com/art/Ponycraft-2-302517624?q=gallery%3Ajunker-kun&qo=1
<Junker-Kun> =D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I'm not sure I'm following your trail of thought here. :$
<Airpuff> Junker-Kun: awesome *-*
<Shizuka> 13otherwise, we have a short list of possible trilogies, just a matter of laying claim to one and picking a week to do it
<Om> Ninjazz: Not a supprise.
<Junker-Kun> Airpuff: Thx!
<Ninjazz> Junker-Kun: I get it. Amazing.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Are we showing everything listed?
<Shizuka> 13not necessarily
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I thought at one point, you wanted to cut the list down.
<Ninjazz> Om: Different reasons this time.
<Airpuff> Junker-Kun: you drew it?! =O
<kirzstryfe> Attempts were made to get the ball rolling on this, but I was told it was to wait until the meeting
<Silverscreen> 1,11Well, as to HOW to make it work, it'd be no different from how BMN did the Lord of the Rings Salute to Summer trilogy event...
<cachi01> kamehameha
<Junker-Kun> Airpuff: Yep
<Om> Ninjazz: And yet...
*Magical_pablez94 is so tired that can't even stay on his hooves... "hello wverypony! how are ya?"
<Mish> Om: (pinkie pie drags you to a party and talks to you Of O HAD A MiC HERE I WOULD TALK FOR HER)
<Michael> hai Magical_pablez94
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I can show you if you'd like. ;)
<Shizuka> 13it's not a definitive list, just the series we could think of in five minutes during the award show planning
<Airpuff> Junker-Kun: You'll be getting another watcher then :$
<Mish> marrrrrrrrrrrrssssssssssssssssss
<GilDash> Magical_pablez94: Holla! :)
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Show me what? I thought you were talking about dragging dead ponies to parties?
<Tassadork> he just called his obstetrician fat...
<Princess_Molestia> *squeee*
<Om> Mish: Are you one of Gillysuits nimbers? e_e
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash: hi :) i did it, seen?
<Ninjazz> Hey Magical_pablez94.
<Mish> om: who?
<fluttercry> 05,15Perhaps there could be another skype group, and sometime this week they could have a meeting to discuss for sure what series to show.
<Junker-Kun> Airpuff: =)
<Ninjazz> Om: No.
<Shizuka> 13https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVKrxhQIDZLdDUwcGlpTG8wT3YzUGhPUlJxV0M4a2c#gid=0
<Mish> Om: WHUT IS DAT
<GilDash> Om: No. Funnily enough. :D
<Silverscreen> 1,11As to the first point, you do know that there's more than just the episodes to stream when it comes to giving a pony fix, right? Fanfictions can be read, fan-videos can be played, fan-art was a little thing we started discussing at one point....
<Airpuff> Oo Hai Magical_pablez94 ! :P
*Magical_pablez94 hugs michael and Ninjazz
<Mish> Om: tell me now
<Ninjazz> Magical_pablez94: :3
<Om> GilDash: So I'm starting to attract rogues now.
<GilDash> Magical_pablez94: I thought you weren't coming on today? :S
*Magical_pablez94 hugs Michael and Ninjazz
*Michael hugs back Magical_pablez94
<GilDash> Om: Hey, I've no control. :D
<Ninjazz> Again? :D
<Magical_pablez94> Michael: :D that ping fail of mine...:D
<Princess_Molestia> PM RP anypony? no ERP?
<Om> No.
*Magical_pablez94 glomps Airpuff
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Music with Vi?
*Airpuff hugs Magical_pablez94 "Hai, hows your day been?"
<fluttercry> 05,15Well the reason I bring up episodes is that is the only thing we really lack. Scoot-Scootaloo does a lot of fanfics and we do fan videos in pre shows.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Yeah, there's plenty of music to play as well.
<Mish> OM: whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhy?
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash: ...yeah i know i told ya i wouldn't. i've done my best to be here anyway.:D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or pony games or games with pony mods?
*Mish afk
<theSHHAS> http://theshhas.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d528n5i
<Ghosties> 04You have to admit, we don't really do G4
*Junker-Kun is derping %(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are a lot of fan-made pony games out there.
<Ghosties> 04But I look upon that with a sense of love, it's kinda become our thing now
<Silverscreen> 1,11Right. So, perhaps in addition to our usual 2 episodes for BMN, maybe give a mid-week episode for them to enjoy or something.
<Bronysith|KoToR> ANYPONY for l4d2?
<Ghosties> 04But I'm all for other pony things
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I could stream Super Fluttershy Land for instance.
<Phase4> 00,02"Lord of the ring" i has all 3 on dvd :3
<Bronysith> thats better
<Magical_pablez94> Airpuff: fucking tiring. i have been walking for da whole day. i went to a comics fair... but it was awesome... there was even some MLP coseplayers..:D
<fluttercry> 05,15Right I'm not saying it become a regular thing. Just something we could start in August to prepare for S3
<Sumica> 00,10been trying to slip in pmvs and such between eps of shows when I stream.
<Mish> yay
<Ghosties> 04Or, going off Silver here, maybe we could have a streameer do at least one pony thing as they stream?
<Junker-Kun> Bronysith|KoToR: Sorry, already have dudes to play with. In about 10 minutes
<Bronysith> Magical_pablez94: at dragoncon i am cosplaying as crono
<Ghosties> 04*streamer
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Well, to be fair, I do usually stream a pony episode or two sometimes when I stream.
<Bronysith> Junker-Kun: mmk
<Airpuff> Magical_pablez94: Cool O.o
<Shizuka> 13in august or september yeah... i see the problem coming back that we had the last time we did a marathon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do pony videos sometimes.
<Phase4> 00,02the desktop ponies seem to make it clear
<Shizuka> 13namely that people are sick of it by the end
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: not all of us have ponies downloaded
<GilDash> Magical_pablez94: Well, don't exhause yourself, okay? :S
<Airpuff> Magical_pablez94: So it's been a tireing day, but awesome? 6_9
<Ghosties> 04Not like a show, but just do something pony related
<Michael> wat
<Silverscreen> 1,11well, if you all remember, when Season 2 started, we did a full Season 1 marathon. I'd say that'd be something big to build up to again for Season 3...
<Ghosties> 04Doesn't have to be a show
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<Magical_pablez94> Airpuff: exactly :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Split the marathon.
<fluttercry> 05,15That was my concern too Shizuka, which is why I think 4-5 episodes max would be good.
<Lil_B> theSHHAS looks... well... awesome :D
<Shizuka> 13right
<Airpuff> Magical_pablez94: .. Aah.. im jealaous :P
<Ghosties> 04I remember talking about doing like
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We should split the marathon.
*GilDash snuggles Magical_pablez94.
<Om> Magical_pablez94: I have no sympathy for you.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01S1 one day. S2 the next.
<Ghosties> 04Just a Season 2 marathon leading up to S3
<Phase4> 00,02how about 1 or 2 a day
<GilDash> Magical_pablez94: Well, you can rest up now. :)
<Junker-Kun> Dude with his head in bull's...
<Silverscreen> 1,11Hell, have someone do a comentary/Let's PLay of Story of the Blanks. That'd be a hell of a stream.
<Ghosties> 04Because I honestly believe S1 and S2 would mean that people get sick of it
<GilDash> Om: You've no sympathy for anypony... sometimes I wonder if you're sociopathic...
<Michael> so much cosmos
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash: don't worry :) i'm never exasted when my energies whore off they'll back to full power! :D
<fluttercry> 05,15Personally, I get tired of it after 2 episodes. But remember who many of our viewers are now.
<Om> GilDash: I have sypathy. You just have to earn it.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Good point, Ghoties.
<Junker-Kun> Magical_pablez94: Are you energizer?
<Ninjazz> I've been meaning to ask, Magical_pablez94. Why did you add Magical to your name?
<Caramel> guys...this is really off-topic
<Ghosties> 04How so?
<Silverscreen> 1,11How?
<Caramel> if we want to do a marathon
<Ghosties> 04It's a part of flutter's topic
<Magical_pablez94> Om: ok. :D instead, i have for ya. :D
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Phase4> 00,02sorry to detour, "Naked Gun" and "The Naked Gun", are they the same thing or different?
<Caramel> discuss it in TL after the meeting
<Ghosties> 04Pre S3 marathons
<Airpuff> Om: what does one do to earn it? xD
<Silverscreen> 1,11We're talking about adding more ponies to the stream.
<Caramel> no one is against doing something
<Caramel> now we're just talking logistics
<Magical_pablez94> Ninjazz: cause i'm a unicorn, silly!
<Ghosties> 04But it's a part of his topic
<Michael> brb
<Caramel> we don't need the entire team meeting to plan that out
<Ghosties> 04Pre S3 marathons
<kirzstryfe> trilogy month
<kirzstryfe> before s3
<Saturn> 08,01so i just ate 100g of white chocolate
<Ghosties> 04It's just suggestions
<Saturn> 08,01AND I FEEL FANTASTIC
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm a pegasus :D
<Magical_pablez94> Junker-Kun: better than!
<Ninjazz> Magical_pablez94: Well, so am I, but that don't mean I got Magical infront of my name.
<GilDash> Saturn: I wonder why. :D
<Junker-Kun> Saturn: =( I want white chocolate too =(
<Silverscreen> 1,11Exactly. We're just suggesting adding them due to the complaints that we aren't streaming enough of them.
<Lil_B> Saturn white choclate is unhealthier then brown one
<Ninjazz> Saturn: Gimme some.
*GilDash hugs Om.
<Airpuff> Saturn: xD
<Magical_pablez94> Airpuff: next time i'll bring you with me :D
<Silverscreen> 1,11WHich is the topic.
<Phase4> 00,024 am, need to go now
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i know
<Om> Airpuff: You? nothing
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm fine moving on, it was just a suggestion to see what the team thought and it looks like it's positive, we can work it out later.
<Airpuff> Magical_pablez94: nice. xD
<Silverscreen> 1,11G'night, Phase.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: They're the same.
<Junker-Kun> Magical_pablez94: Wanna be my cell phone battery? =D
<Lil_B> Saturn You should feel bad for everything (
<GilDash> Om: I only seem to know how to gain your ire, so that'll have to do. :)
<Airpuff> Om: ahaha so im wont be able to get it at all?
<RAWRity> funfact: apparently every atom in your body used to be part of a star.
<Oujo> Night, Phase!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Later Phase4
<DerpSurge> Saturn: white chocolate <3
<Phase4> 00,02i'll leave my laptop on so it logs
<Magical_pablez94> Ninjazz: ... well just dunno anyway... i just love being Magical! XD
<Michael> back
<Silverscreen> 1,11MOving on to Flutter's second topic, the trilogy streams...
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: There's not much point putting the word fact next to the word apparently.
<Phase4> 00,02skim through when i wake up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SuperBrony64: So am I (as a pony).
<Om> I retract my precious statment about sympathy.
<Magical_pablez94> Junker-Kun: :D:D is it that crappy?
<Ninjazz> Magical_pablez94: Can't argue with that. :D
<Airpuff> Om: lol..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pegasi are superior to all other races! =p
<Om> GilDash: Its a lot easyer to be angry. Much less to understand.
<Silverscreen> 1,11When I was still around, I had some people discussing streaming tv series as well. Perhaps we could do something to sorta combine the two...or should that be reserved for the whole "queue streams" thing?
<GilDash> Om: Anger is a complex emotion. ;)
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: Same. Where mean old pegasisisisisisis that make it snow like crazy! :P
<Junker-Kun> Magical_pablez94: No. But these new resistive touch screens eats battery in two days. Damn it, my old phone could live up to a WEEK!
<Airpuff> Om: ... you're really hard.. to understand..
<Ninjazz> Nittany_Discord: Dat Suprecist
<Om> GilDash: But the means that have it come about are simplistic.
<GilDash> Om: Are they? ;)
<Om> Airpuff: Why would you try.
<Magical_pablez94> Om: happy hearing you retrected it :D
<Junker-Kun> Magical_pablez94: BTW, having a unicorn as a battery... how would it work? O_o
*Michael is tired
<Airpuff> Om: donno, human nature, want to get more social connections?
<Ghosties> 04Okay, Shizuka had something she wanted to say, so, Shizuka, please say it
<MahBoi777> lol
<Magical_pablez94> Junker-Kun: magic powers will chrge your phone obviously!
<prince-lemon> Room is muted?
<Om> GilDash: How much do do remember being angry over happy.
<Om> Magical_pablez94: No Idea what you just said.
<Shizuka> 13https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVKrxhQIDZLdDUwcGlpTG8wT3YzUGhPUlJxV0M4a2c#gid=0
<Junker-Kun> Magical_pablez94: Yeas, but then I'll have to take a unicorn with me... Hey, that sounds kinda cool!
<GilDash> Om: I tend not to remember anything. :)
<Magical_pablez94> Ninjazz: :D maybe is cause i'm one of best ponies at using magic :D
<Shizuka> 13this list, list of trilogies, not exhaustive or final just ideas
<Shizuka> 13claim one
<Shizuka> 13or add one
<Om> GilDash: Excuses.
<Ninjazz> Magical_pablez94: Oh are you... :$
<Shizuka> 13we have more than enough to last the summer i'm sure
<Airpuff> Om: you remember angry and happy emotions just as easy Om..
<Silverscreen> 1,11That's a hell of a list.
<MahBoi777> Magical_pablez94: mmmmmmagic *snort snort*
<Sumica> 00,10not realy
*Magical_pablez94 quotes "[20:03:02] <Om> I retract my precious statment about sympathy."
<Om> Airpuff: Sure.
<Shizuka> 13personally i'd rather make sure they're all claimed rather than set weeks for streaming them
<Junker-Kun> MahBoi777: Please, stop making these references to Mr. Bean -__- My friend will kill me with this someday...
<GilDash> Om: Well, it depends on what I choose to remember. So, theoretically, either can outdo the other. :)
<Om> GilDash: I know that as a falicy.
<Meanwhile> What a story guy posed on a rock.
<Sumica> 00,1012 weeks 2 set events so 10 triligys
<Magical_pablez94> MahBoi777: ??
<Michael> wtf
<Shizuka> 13if they're all claimed then at the start of a week you can just volunteer to stream it
<MahBoi777> Junker-Kun: lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Star trek 1-3. You mean Star Wars 1 - 3?
<Sumica> 00,10not sure who added James bond to the set events
<Shizuka> 13i'm getting dragged away, won't be back for some time
<alexxm> hey guys
<Magical_pablez94> Junker-Kun: it sure sounds cool...'cause ponies are cool!
<Ninjazz> Hey alexxm!
<Saturn> 08,01i thought we'd already showed Band of Brothers?
<Junker-Kun> alexxm: Hey!
<Saturn> 08,01i remember someone streamed it
<Junker-Kun> Magical_pablez94: Hell yeah! /)
<fluttercry> 05,15That's for the July 4th event

<Silverscreen> 1,11And we already did the LotR trilogy last year.

<Lil_B> nope, its because plantes are stupid
<alexxm> i'm good MahBoi777
<Ghosties> 04I honestly wanted to do LotR again at the end of the event
<Ghosties> 04Because tradition
<Michael> Wb alexxm
<Airpuff> Magical_pablez94: .. Ponies arent cool.. they are AWESOME
<Magical_pablez94> Junker-Kun: (\ ((supper's ready be back in 10 minutes))
<AllisZero> And because Hobbit in December!
<Magical_pablez94> Airpuff: sorry.....:D
<Ghosties> 04That too

<cachi01> bye Magical_pab|Supper
<alexxm> bye Magical_pablez94
<MahBoi777> Om: cuz it's quite addicting
<Magical_pab|Supper> CYA! :D
<Silverscreen> 1,11If we're doing it again, then we do it right. The last weekend before school starts, remember? But that's a discussion for another time.
<Airpuff> Om: good question.. What do you like about it here then?
<Ghosties> 04Over the weekend is fine for me, for LotR
<Sumica> 00,10oki
<cachi01> buck i lost my phone charger :l
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi everypony
<Ghosties> 04We can really get into getting this set up over the week, the trilogy thing I mean. But perhaps we should move on now
<Junker-Kun> Okay, I think I'll go play some L4D2. See you... um... tommorow, I think?
<Silverscreen> 1,11I think we have that set, so who has the next topic?
<cachi01> hi HatsuneMikuFan!
<Ninjazz> Hello HatsuneMikuFan.
<MahBoi777> hey HatsuneMikuFan
<GilDash> Om: Show no sympathy, expect none in return. :)
<Michael> bronystate is addictive
<Airpuff> cachi01: .. aww. lame :(
<Michael> hai HatsuneMikuFan
<Ninjazz> Cya Junker-Kun.
<MahBoi777> cachi01: that sucks
<Ghosties> 04Scoot-Scootaloo
<Airpuff> Hi HatsuneMikuFan
<Meanwhile> Allo HatsuneMikuFan.
<cachi01> no music for me today :(
<LordCelestia> 0,5With partnerships and new members
<DerpSurge> Michael: this, one million times
<Om> GilDash: Never have.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Present
*GilDash nuzzles Om.
<GilDash> Om: You'll get it from me anyway. :)
<Ghosties> 04Whenever you are ready, Scoot
<Airpuff> Om: So why are you here then? Do you enjoy it? :P
<Michael> DerpSurge: its funny because it's true
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Okay
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Afternoon, everyone! Today, I will be talking about a possible partnership with Everypony Sings, a website based on composing fan music of the show. Half of the Podcast team are already on good terms with their whole staff, and I believe that we can work together well! Like us, they are ambitious, even going as far as doing their own interviews with people from the show to holding contests on who can make the
<HatsuneMikuFan> So what are we watching?
<Saturn> 08,01i drink way too much Mate
<Om> Airpuff: Dunno.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm peeing like a racehorse all the time
<Michael> HatsuneMikuFan: carl sagan
<Saturn> 08,01Carl Sagan's Cosmos
<Airpuff> Om: You must have some idea? 6_9
<GilDash> Saturn: Now you know your lesson. :D
<HatsuneMikuFan> Okay, thank you
<Airpuff> Saturn: .. does racehorses pee alot? o.o
*Bronysith glomps Airpuff
<RAWRity> Saturn: ou should just invest in a catheder.
*Airpuff hugs Bronysith :)
<Saturn> 08,01Airpuff: presumably
*Bronysith glomps Saturn
<Airpuff> Saturn: How come? They drink alot of water?
<GilDash> Airpuff: Obviously Om's here for my attentions. ;)
*Saturn 08,01gives Bronysith 1,000 glomps starting now
<Bronysith> AYA
<MahBoi777> lol
<GilDash> Airpuff: Presumably impies Saturn has no idea. :D
<Om> Airpuff: Probably just that.
<Derpyty> i get no glomps?
<Michael> so much glomps
<Derpyty> D:
<Airpuff> GilDash: Most likely.. he's not exactly.. welcoming for many.. others....
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03best cover and such. Needless to say, they have a lot of potential and would most likely help us for our future plans. Not only that, but it will help them as well, giving them a publicity boost for their site. It’s a win-win situation! 
<GilDash> Airpuff: He's not welcoming to me either. He's just *used* to me. :D
*MahBoi777 glomps Derpyty
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
*Michael glomps Derpyty
*RAWRity gropes Om
<Airpuff> GilDash: I guess. xD
<Derpyty> (yay O3O)
<Airpuff> GilDash: He does atleast answer me now . :D
<Om> -_^
<Ninjazz> Well... That's new...
<MahBoi777> xD
<Vinyer> wow.
<Airpuff> Right Om? :P
<Vinyer> apparently both tommy lee and will smith have said they would consider taking part in an MIB4
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I will now open the floor to anyone who has any questions/objections/praise.
<GilDash> Om: See. I'm not *that* bad. ;)
<Om> I dilike being the topic. Be back in roughly an hour.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, details?
*LordCelestia praises Scoot-Scootaloo
<Ninjazz> Can this guy put me to sleep any faster?...
<Silverscreen> 1,11It's an interesting proposition. Unfortunately I haven't heard of them before, but it sounds like they're another group that's promoting the hard work of the fanbase.
<Airpuff> Om: Kai.
*Oujo joins LordCelestia
<MahBoi777> lol later Om
<DerpSurge> GilDash: only naughty :D
<Michael> bye Om
<Ninjazz> Om: Cya soon, buddy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Honestly, I didn't hear about them until shortly before our interview.
<HatsuneMikuFan> By Om
<Ponies47> Bye bye Om :)
<RaveBrony> Cya Om :P
<LordCelestia> 0,5I remember taking part in the interview with Everypony sings, and they're great people. I wouldnt object to a partnership at all.
<HyperMetalLugia> cool
<Silverscreen> 1,11and if that's the case, I think this is a good idea.
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Brony musicians used their work for their music at one point. 
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So they need to popularity boost.
<GilDash> DerpSurge: You don't know what I get up to behind closed doors. ;)
<Michael> god is made of geometry?
<MahBoi777> hey RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> Hey MahBoi777 :)
<Bronysith> MahBoi777: wasabi
<Saturn> 08,01yet another example of the "oh, me too!" side of the fandom...
<Ninjazz> That's like the sixth yawn...
<Ghosties> 04We could possibly set up some kind of meeting with them later
<EggWhite> Ramiel is God?
<MahBoi777> Bronysith: wazuuuuuuuuup
<GilDash> I've got dinner now, so back in a bit. ;)
*Airpuff gives Ninjazz pure caffeine
<Litwick> inb4 comments saying "boobs"
<Michael> nope
<Bronysith> Litwick: wasabi
<Airpuff> kk enjoy dinner GilDash
<Ninjazz> Cya GilDash. Take care.
<DerpSurge> GilDash: neither do you :D
<Michael> bye GilDash
<MahBoi777> DINNER
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I think I can arrange that
<HatsuneMikuFan> Have fun eating dinner GilDash|AFK
<MahBoi777> bye GilDash|AFK
<Silverscreen> 1,11We'd be promoting a site that promotes honest work from the community. It's a smart decision that boosts people's opinions about us and our site as well as getting everyone involved more noticed.
<GilDash|AFK> MahBoi777: Wanna share? ;)
<Ninjazz> There it is.
<Luna> it sounds interesting, i'm all for meeting them
<Ghosties> 04Okay, so, in regards to Everypony Sings: "Set up a meeting with them to discuss further"
<Luna> to iron out the details
*Ninjazz pats MahBoi777 on the back
<Ghosties> 04Next?
<Ninjazz> That's what you get.
<GilDash|AFK> Ninjazz: Come on! Let me have some fun! :D
<Ninjazz> GilDash|AFK: STATEMENT STAND! :|
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Okay then,
<Airpuff> GilDash|AFK: ..go eat.. now :|
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: eeeeyup
<Airpuff> xD
<Silverscreen> 1,11Alright. Well until we get that meeting, this topic's done with. Who's next.
<GilDash|AFK> Ninjazz: I'll be back later then. :p
<MahBoi777> GilDash|AFK: no thanks
<Luna> Scoot has more items
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I think I still am
<Ghosties> 04Scoot still
<Ninjazz> GilDash|AFK: We shall see. I actually might be asleep by then. :S
<Ghosties> 04New members or something
<LordCelestia> 0,5^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Second, since there are certain departments with too few people, I propose we start looking for more people that would be of value to said departments. The podcast team has had a lot of trouble getting it together with the amount of people we currently have. 
<MahBoi777> hi Airpuff
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: Im having problems staying awake to the stream.. its takin its tall xD
<Ghosties> 04How many do you have now?
<Airpuff> MahBoi777: Hai :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Also, it might prove beneficial to recruit well known people. One such example is an artist by the name of Valcron being part of the artist department. It could help boost publicity and give us more viewers/regulars/friends
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: I know right?...
<Michael> hai MahBoi777
<Bronysith> MahBoi777: did u say u were going to want to be part of the brony fukireta parade?
<MahBoi777> hi Michael
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: ... must... stay.. awake..
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And we have 8 people myself included
<MahBoi777> Bronysith: hmm?
<kirzstryfe> Art: 7; Lit: 5; A/V: 7; Tech: 3; Gaming: 4
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Uh oh.
<alexxm> hey Airpuff hows your day been
<Caramel> You have 8 people and you're having trouble?
*Michael gives energy drink to Airpuff
<cachi01> pingas
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some are inactive.
<LordCelestia> 0,5*pinkie pie trombone*
<Airpuff> alexxm: It's been good :)
<Michael> lol
<Oujo> Oh dear...
<MahBoi777> usual I see
<Caramel> Well, that's an issue with the *people* not the number
<cachi01> lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Please keep focused LC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01AV has more of a communication problem than a lack of manpower IMO.
<Caramel> we can hire more people if there's a reason to, but right now we've got a lot of members. If people aren't doing their jobs, then we might have to reconsider their positions here
<Oujo> Does Valcron have a deviantART or tumblr?
<Ghosties> 04On the topic with Valcron, we have spoken with him and talked to him about joining Art Dept.
<Silverscreen> 1,11A/V?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But that issue is for later.
<LordCelestia> 0,5There he is.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sorry, laptop being a jerk:/
<Dark_Horst> lol kepler
<Michael> chat quiet
<Lil_B> Kepler... Oh You :3
<kirzstryfe> Valcron is dreatos on DA
<Ninjazz> Whoa... DOn't keep your eyes closed for too long.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So yeah, floors open again
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: .. i know..
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: i dipped of a bit, my head slammed in the wall >.<
<Ghosties> 04With Valcron: He mentioned that he needed some time to think it over
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: Sleepy hoof (\
<Ninjazz> :D
<HatsuneMikuFan> Ninjazz: Are you still awake?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Audio/Visual
<Caramel> If there's justification for hiring someone, bring it to the admins and we'll discuss it (like with Valcron)
<Irish_Pony> So whats this nerd talking about?
<kirzstryfe> part of the issue with manpower is people spreading themselves thin, I'm looking at the list and I see a few people in multiple depts
<Caramel> otherwise, the departments need to get their act together
<Dark_Horst> and then someone discovered the other planets AND CRUSHED HIS BELEIVES!
<Ninjazz> HatsuneMikuFan: Not completely. :D
<Ran> 2Wait, didn't the third one just come out
<Airpuff> /) Sleepy hoof Ninjazz
<HatsuneMikuFan> lol
<Michael> omg
<Caramel> if people aren't going to do their jobs, then they don't belong on the team. I know it's harsh, but that's just how it is
<Derpyty> TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHER FUNGER!
<luigifan365> I'm back......again.......for the 3rd time this week.....
<Ghosties> 04Kirz brings up a good point, perhaps there should only be one person in one department?
<Caramel> we can't go around hiring 70 people because only 20 will do their work
<MahBoi777> hello luigifan365
<Silverscreen> 1,11well shit, if you need more A/V work, look to me. You people do know I'm currently and A/V editing student, right? I have Premiere and After-effects available almost 24/7 just ten minutes away from me.
<Michael> Wb luigifan365
<Airpuff> wb.. luigifan365
<HyperMetalLugia> yes
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi luigifan365
<Ghosties> 04Er
<Ninjazz> Welcome, luigifan365.
<Derpyty> Applebloom:Teachers have soul!
<Ghosties> 04One person should just stick to one department ><
<DuskStarshimmer> Does RanbowDash taste like rainbows @_@?
<Luna> Silver; noted
<Ninjazz> No.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That'll work because we have zero posted interviews because most are unedited.
<Airpuff> DuskStarshimmer: ... Skittles :P
<Ninjazz> Skittles.
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: (\
<LordCelestia> 0,5Why just one department?
<DuskStarshimmer> mmm sweet
<Ninjazz> Again, man.
<Derpyty> SHE BLINDED ME WITH SINCENCE!
<Michael> fail
<RAWRity> You have to wonder if, in 200 years, people will look back and laugh at what the hell Stephen Hawking thought he was doing.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Silver, I'm gonna need to talk to you after this meeting
<LordCelestia> 0,5Some people are able to handle it.
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: /) xD
<luigifan365> what are we watching?
<prince-lemon> If you spread yourself too thin, you're not going to be effective.
<kirzstryfe> Not so much that Ghosties, but only stay in the dept if you can handle the load and help with each
<Airpuff> RAWRity: kno right -.-
<Silverscreen> 1,11Interviews? Shit, i'm in the middle of doing a DOCUMENTARY with 2 interviews on a local busienss. I could get those done in a week.
<Irish_Pony> VIVE REVOULUTION!
<LordCelestia> 0,5But if we have one person to one dept, then the number of people in each dept. will be pathetic.
<Michael> luigifan365: cosmos carl sagan
<cachi01> REVOLUTION
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll have to quit interviews or step down from gaming dept lead if we have to stick to one dept.
<Ninjazz> Heresy!
<Airpuff> Hi Irish_Pony :P
<LordCelestia> 0,5With what, 19 people and like, 4 departments
<Irish_Pony> Airpuff: Hi :)
<Ghosties> 04Then, like Val said, perhaps we should be looking to do some rearranging with the members themselves
<prince-lemon> That's not a pathetic number
<MahBoi777> hi Irish_Pony
<fluttercry> 05,15Yes LC however they'll be able to concentrate on that one department more.
<Ghosties> 04It's not lack of members
<Ninjazz> Ohey Irish. Feeling better, now?
*Michael drinks some jack daniels
<Airpuff> Irish_Pony: this .. stream.. is heavy.. just so ya know >.<
<cachi01> drocsid
<Ghosties> 04Look at Art
*Midnight_Tempest revolts
<Ghosties> 04There's a decent number of folks, but nothing is really getting done
<Luna> ^
<Ghosties> 04Now I understand that there are circumstances
<Ninjazz> Hey Midnight_Tempest.
<Ghosties> 04I get that
<Irish_Pony> Ninjazz: not really but drinking Orange Juice REALLY helps :$
<DuskStarshimmer> Dafaq Im I whatching.jpg
<Airpuff> Hi Midnight_Tempest
<Michael> hai Midnight_Tempest
<Ghosties> 04I know what's going on, but shit luck or not it's not lack of members
<MahBoi777> hi Midnight_Tempest
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi Midnight_Tempest
<Ninjazz> Irish_Pony: I lol'd. :D
<Ghosties> 04It's motivation
<Ghosties> 04Getting it done
<Silverscreen> 1,11It's lack of willpower and getting it DONE.
<Ghosties> 04Like Val said
<RAWRity> She was not a happy pony
<DuskStarshimmer> Doesnt matter, had lol.
<Ghosties> 04You are on the team, you should be contributing to the team if you're on it
<Luna> I think as it now.. we have enough people on the team but we do need to look into workload / positions and such.. which will be discussed later on.
<Airpuff> Irish_Pony: .. it does?
<Caramel> The point is
<Silverscreen> 1,11In my case, I'd do it just because I could always use the freelance work and practice for my career.
<Irish_Pony> Airpuff: eeyup...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, bringing any new ideas to bearASAP.
*Michael closes her eyes slowly
<Ghosties> 04And I'm not saying everyone is this way, but still, when nobody replies to something for the group to do...
<Ghosties> 04It's kinda discouraging
<Airpuff> Irish_Pony: .. im like 90% dead now
<pikorar> Hello everybody! I am here, and I am feeling well rested. I had another long 13 hour rest. Summer break is only 4 days away and I can't wait.
<MahBoi777> shleeeeeeep
<Caramel> if there is this feeling that the teams have too much workload or whatnot
<Caramel> bring it up in the TL group
<Irish_Pony> Airpuff: wut...??
<Caramel> again, use that group more often
<Luna> ^
<MahBoi777> hey pikorar, how are you?
<Luna> COMMUNICATION is magic
<Michael> hai pikorar
<Meanwhile> Hooplah.
<Meanwhile> Allo pikorar.
<Airpuff> Hi pikorar ... sounds nice..
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi pikorar
<Airpuff> Irish_Pony: .. seriously sickly ssleep atm -.-
<Ninjazz> Hey pikorar!
<Airpuff> sleepy*
<Irish_Pony> A gold nose????
<Vinyer> yes
<Vinyer> it's just a rumor at this point
<Rain> ALL the mods!
<RAWRity> Irish_Pony: eeyup
<MahBoi777> Airpuff: shleeeeeeeep
*Rain hugs Luna
<Oujo> ^
<pikorar> Hi MahBoi777, I am good, and you? Hello Michael, hi Meanwhile, hello Airpuff, howdy HatsuneMikeFan, hey Ninjazz.
<Airpuff> MahBoi777: .. i dont... wanna!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That so much.
*Luna 07,01snugs Rain
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Timely communication.
<Ninjazz> :)
<MahBoi777> u know u wanna
<Kandarihu> Table scraps?
<Silverscreen> 1,11The issue and solutions are simple: If you volunteer for the work, do the work. If it's too much work for you, tell us and we'll either scrap it or find someone else to do it. Don't lead us on thinking you got work going on when it's not even past phase 1.
<Irish_Pony> Luna: <3
*Michael is half asleep
<Rain> how are you, Lulu?
<Dermathil> Afternoon all...
<SilverSonic> LOL YOU TWO RETURN AT THE SAME TIME XD
<MahBoi777> pikorar: I am just fine lol
<Meanwhile> Allo Dermathil.
*Airpuff pokes Michael "dont sleep.."
<Ninjazz> Hey Dermathil!
<SilverSonic> just as you went away at the same time earlier
<Luna> 07,01busy dear, i'll talk to you in a bit
<Vinyer> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black_3#Potential_sequel
<MahBoi777> good afternoon Dermathil
<Rain> ok then ^_^
<Ponies47> Hello Luna :)
<RAWRity> They say Bartimaeus of Uruk, the Snake of Silver Plumes, crafted Tycho Brahe's golden nose after he lost it in a duel over another man's wife.
*Michael jumps
<pikorar> Kepler is depress.
<Ponies47> Michael: WAKE UP! :[
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi Dermathil
<Irish_Pony> Airpuff: Well have a nice cup of oragne juice before you sleep :)
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: NO they must sleeeeep
<Michael> yay
<RAWRity> inb4 nobody gets that reference.
<Angel_Espeon> 13this isn't what it looks like
<DerpSurge> FUN MATHEMATICS? HOW DARE THEY, said Kepler-
<Angel_Espeon> 13I swear
<Airpuff> Irish_Pony: .. before i sleep?... i dont want to sleep!
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5169/
<Airpuff> Ponies47: indeed..
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4560/
<Ran> 2The word 'sequel' has lost a lot of its appeal pertaining to movies lately :<
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: heheh okay
<Silverscreen> 1,11The problem isn't manpower, it's willpower. We used to run this site with only 4 fucking people getting an average of 300 people in the chat at each event. We can do the work, we just gotta get up and start doing it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's lots and Lots_of_ponies!
*MahBoi777 backs away from Ponies47
<Luna> Thank you Silverscreen
<Michael> Ponies47: i must ... resist
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: That is basically you in your entirety.
<Ponies47> Airpuff: I hate sleep
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Ninjazz> Indeed, I do, Bronysith.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: yup
<pikorar> He died of fat.
<Michael> omg
<Airpuff> Ponies47: indeed.. feels like a waste of time.. -.-
<RAWRity> He choked on a hunk of ham.
<Meanwhile> He's a fat fatty fat fat.
<Airpuff> http://scranton.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw661_confound20these20ponies20they20drive20me20to20insomnia.jpg
<Bronysith> http://bronysith.deviantart.com/
<MahBoi777> lol Bronysith
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Confound this insomia, it drives me to ponies.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03But we still have to worry about what's going on in our own time. Some of us do half to deal with personal issues that they can't focus all their time on BS
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Whaaaaaats wrong? You don't have to FEAR me! *Makes a really creepy smile*
<Luna> that's fine and all
<Ninjazz> Insomia this confound.
<Airpuff> Nittany_Discord: xD
<Luna> as long as you communicate
<Irish_Pony> Confound these ponies they drive me to unprotected sex!
<Luna> so we know what's going on
<Luna> and can work around it
<MahBoi777> Nittany_Discord: so true
<pikorar> Confound this Carl Rosen, he drives me to smart.
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: i think Irish_Pony wants another round
<Silverscreen> 1,11I know Scoot. Why do you think I've been gone for the past five months. That's why we need to keep communications between each other and keep everyone knowing what the hell's going on.
<Ghosties> 04Okay, so, result of topic: Re-evaluate how members are used?
<Irish_Pony> NO!@
<Caramel> The only time it's a problem is when someone says they'll do something, and then does nothing for a month
<Airpuff> Bronysith: xDD
<Princess_Molestia> not now
<Ghosties> 04I'm not sure how to result this topic
<Derpyty> take some SPOIL THEN SOME TURD AND STACK ,A SPOIL TURD STACK XD
<Airpuff> Irish_Pony: .. Safe. xD
<Irish_Pony> *phew*
<Litwick> :D
<Ghosties> 04Because I'll be honest
<the> foolish ponys im back!
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: Unprotected, but fun?
<Bronysith> the: hi
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: maybe......
<Ninjazz> Hello the shortest name I've seen in a while.
<kamina> PIERCE THE HEAVENS
<the> discord :[:[:[
<Ghosties> 04It was being considered, cutting people from teams, because as Val has brought up when nobody says anything then nothing gets done; we don't even know if you're okay or not if you don't talk to the dept.
<Airpuff> That feeling when you realise you have mathexams the next day 6_9
<Ponies47> I just love love love ponies! :D
<Athgaar> is there anything on the stream
<Michael> hai kamina
<pikorar> Hi the! I love you!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I think this goes hand in hand with communication. We should be able to elaborate on it on later topics.
<Ghosties> 04Communication
<pikorar> Supa zoom.
<Ghosties> 04If you don't talk
<Ghosties> 04We don't know
<pikorar> He said Celestial!
<Luna> communication more or less is the main item for this entire meeting
<Soital> 12Pixar sequels
<Lil_B> Orbits are Elippses and Kepler could not except it
<Soital> 12fff yeah
<Ninjazz> Yay.
<Luna> it keeps returning
<cachi01> dat feeling when u dont lsten to music.........
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mine turtle! *explodeS*
<Ponies47> When is this movie over? :(
<kamina> Ponies47: hi
<Oujo> Dropping hints probably isn't a good idea either. And yes.
<MahBoi777> it never ends Ponies47 O__O
<Q> this movie will never end
<Silverscreen> 1,11We keep talking about it, but how do we fix it?
<RAWRity> Ponies47: never
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey kamina
<Bronysith> OMG ITS Q
<Midnight_Tempest> never, we will watch it again until we are all smart
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Funny how communication is my only topic.
<Ninjazz> Dat Q
<Irish_Pony> Confound these ponies! They drive me to dying from dawness! http://monopoly907.deviantart.com/#/d526dih
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it's at the end.
<Ghosties> 04Like I said, it was being considered cutting people from teams
<MahBoi777> lol Q
<Silverscreen> 1,11Here's how:
<Silverscreen> 1,11Lay out what we want to do, which department does it, and who in that department gets the work.
<Ghosties> 04But everybody is against that
<LordCelestia> 0,5Because, Ty...
<DuskStarshimmer> AKA orbit
<Silverscreen> 1,11IF there's an issue, tell someone about it.
<the> discords back foolish ponys :[
<LordCelestia> 0,5Even if the problem isnt numbers
<Airpuff> Hai Q
<Silverscreen> 1,11It's people.
<Ghosties> 04It's the motivation
<Ponies47> *Facedesk*
<cachi01> Midnight_Tempest: i dont want to be smart i just want mah music
<LordCelestia> 0,5Those who are there have potential
<Ghosties> 04You are in the group
<LordCelestia> 0,5If they are removed, then there is less potential
<Ghosties> 04You are there to participate, guys...
<Ghosties> 04If you're just there
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 6Watchog.
<pikorar> The area of each is always the same.
<Ghosties> 04And not doing anything...
<Silverscreen> 1,11It's not potential if they don't do the work.
<Ghosties> 04^
<Caramel> potential is useless if it's not utilized
<Midnight_Tempest> cachi01: well, you can always just turn off the stream... people that dont like this dont have to watch it :P
<Ghosties> 04^
<Ghosties> 04If you're just there, and you don't do anything
<Ghosties> 04Then yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What Silver said.
<Q> Thou art notified that thy kind hath infiltrated the galaxy toofar already. Thou art directed to return to thine own solarsystem immediately
<Ghosties> 04You're kinda seen as dead weight
<the> when does season 3 come
<Ghosties> 04Just anything, please
<cachi01> Midnight_Tempest: i want mah music :l
<the> when does season 3 come
<Ghosties> 04That's all I'm asking for
<Ghosties> 04Give us something to work with
<Vinyer> lol
<cachi01> Midnight_Tempest: but mah phone is dead :l
<Ponies47> the: Fall
<Lil_B> the this year
<Midnight_Tempest> never
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll bring up my concerns at my time.
<pikorar> Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 taught me everything I need to know about planets.
<MahBoi777> NEVA
<DuskStarshimmer> ABSTRACT? BUCK YOU
<cachi01> Midnight_Tempest: this day will be boring :l
<Caramel> There's an admin in every single department group
<the> when does season 3 come
<Q> Will you stop interrupting me? I mean, this is hardly atime to be teaching you the true nature of the universe.
<Caramel> if there's an issue
<Caramel> say it
<Ponies47> the: Fall
<the> what mounth
*DuskStarshimmer is steamed
<MahBoi777> pikorar: u have learned well
<Caramel> that admin will bring it to the other admins
<Meanwhile> Whenever I pay attention to this show I feel like I'm looking at the TARDIS.
<RAWRity> the: eventually
<Caramel> and then the admins will do something
<pikorar> Nobody knows when season 3 is being released.
<Caramel> we can't do anything if we don't know
<Midnight_Tempest> the: never, they cancelled it
<the> arggggggggg
<Dr_Who> hello
<the> arggggggggg
<Lil_B> Q are you and Pikar in a releationship?
<Ponies47> I heard it's gonna be in the fall

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That being said, I think I'm done with my topic.
<Ghosties> 04Alright
<Luna> Alright
<Oujo> Ok.
<Ghosties> 04So, result: BETTER COMMUNICATION
<Ghosties> 04TALK MORE
<Lil_B> Dr_Who Who are you?
<the> arggggggggg
<Ghosties> 04Next?
<Dr_Who> Lil_B: im the dr
<Ponies47> the: Why do you keep posting the same thing 3 times?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Don't be a Fluttershy!
<Luna> moi
<the> arggggggggg
<Ponies47> the: Or more :|
<Dr_Who> Ponies47: why not?
<Michael> dat arg spam
<Lil_B> Dr_Who Dr Who?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Next I think is the topic of BronyCon, isn't it?
<Oujo> We love each other here! And ok! :3
<Ghosties> 04Ah, Luna
<Dr_Who> Lil_B: just the Doctor
<Luna> nope
<Silverscreen> 1,11oh, sorry.
<Luna> BronyCon will come later
<Luna> don't worry
<Ponies47> Dr_Who: Idk
<Ghosties> 04Luna is next
<DuskStarshimmer> ./) Gravity (\ So abstract
*Lil_B has never seen Dr Who
<Airpuff> "Knock knock!"
<EccoCode> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> EccoCode, you are a 7Whirlipede.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Luna, you're up.
<Airpuff> .... anyone? :'(
<Midnight_Tempest> nope
<Luna> Alright so this was a crazy idea I had to fix the streaming issues and our currently shadowy business with the content we stream (movies / series and what not)
*DuskStarshimmer has never enjoyed Dr. Who.
<Lil_B> Airpuff whos there?
<pikorar> The candles they light up nothing!
<Dr_Who> Midnight_Tempest: hello
<Airpuff> Lil_B: Doctor....
<cachi01> Lil_B: same here
<DuskStarshimmer> Dis coooooood
<Luna> What if we would create various sections on our mainpage with general info about the department and maybe even a department themed stream
<pikorar> He said harmony and discord in the same sentence. He is a brony.
<Lil_B> Airpuff Dr who?
<cachi01> there is a videogame s dr wh right now
<Airpuff> Lil_B: ..Yay. xD
<Luna> that way we could provide original content
<Luna> Art > art stream
<Bronysith> did the dr leave?
<Midnight_Tempest> there are many dr who games
<DerpSurge> pikorar: ikr :D
<Luna> gaming > live games
<Michael> omg
<Lil_B> Airpuff Dr Yay?
<cachi01> really? never seen any
<Bronysith> oh shit
<Airpuff> Lil_B: No.. dro who ._.
<Michael> a dr who game?
<Luna> Audio > podcasts / interview playlist
<cachi01> yeah for ps3
<Bronysith> A PORTAL TO EQUESTRIA just appeared right next to me
<Midnight_Tempest> sure it did
<Bronysith> brb
*DuskStarshimmer stands next to Bronysith
*Bronysith enters portal
<cachi01> it sure did buddy
<Ninjazz> And I'm princess Celestia.
<cachi01> it sure did
*Michael goes with bronysith
*Bronysith comes back through portal
*DuskStarshimmer bows in Ninjazz hnour
<Bronysith> well that was quite jolly good
<Luna> So my idea is have seperate streams on the mainpage, because we are more than just a streaming site.. we have a young team and plenty of excellent ideas and talents.
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: and im Ninjazz !
<Lil_B> Airpuff wait... You confused me ._. now I have to think :/ wether or not Your name is Dr yay ore Dr who
<Meanwhile> Blooming dark ages.
<RAWRity> Bronysith: Turns out that was actually a portal to Narnia
<Lil_B> hey look, big Ponys
<Meanwhile> Why didn't they just make loads of candles?
<Luna> ./discuss
<Airpuff> Lil_B: Dr who, you silly xD
<Ninjazz> :$
<Bronysith> RAWRity: wrong. narnia is lame
<DuskStarshimmer> Im soo glad I exist in a logical society
<Michael> wat
<Luna> (that was point 1)
<pikorar> False Bronysith, if you went to Equestria you wouldn't come back because you wouldn't want to.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Separate, simultaneous streams?
<Meanwhile> And she sold drugs.
<Luna> yes
<Lil_B> Airpuff what is your PhD?
<Meanwhile> What.
*Michael stays on equestria
<Airpuff> Lil_B: PhD? o.o
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: back then drugs were REALLY bad, mmkay?
<Luna> so the first question is for the techies is this possible?
<Lil_B> Airpuff you sid you are a doctor ._.
<Litwick> what's with al the sciencey stuff today?\
<SlurryMoon> multiple streams going on at once... so the viewers can choose what they want to watch?
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Dark age drugs are best drugs.
<fluttercry> 05,15I like the idea, my only concern is that would mean more chat rooms to cover.
<kirzstryfe> it is Luna, we've actually had this discussion before
<alexxm> he visited luna
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03^
<Airpuff> Lil_B: Doctor who.. is the doctor?...
<Bronysith> lol
<Michael> omg
<Oujo> Maybe we can use LiveStream for streams like that? Like links to the LiveStream place
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We don't need a chat room for every stream.
<Michael> i heard celestia
<prince-lemon> ^
<Lil_B> Airpuff YOU ARE TEARING ME APART Airpuff !!!!!
<Luna> ^
<HatsuneMikuFan> I want to become a space man to see Luna and Space core
<Oujo> If they desperately want a chatroom that is and ahh true
<Bronysith> i cant believe all of this started with some ponce coming into chance witht hte name dr_who
<kirzstryfe> could open up a side room if needed, we have 6 extra
<Silverscreen> 1,11We don't need separate streams to show diffent forms of content. the beauty of streaming electronic media is that it can be any media. We have discussed this before, and the answer has been "now."
<Yahooz> Dark age drugs involved cutting off people's limbs. Good times
<Ghosties> 04How many streams are we thinking, though
<cachi01> Bronysith: lol
<Airpuff> Lil_B: Im not teasing! I was trying to get to Doctor who!!! XD
<Silverscreen> 1,11no*
<Bronysith> Yahooz: and opening up puppies and rubbing on wounds
*alexxm hugs Airpuff
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: are u ready yet?
<Michael> rescue luna!
<Yahooz> Bronysith: just absolutely woderful wasnt it?
<Wrek> 05no more livestream usage unless its a must
<Ghosties> 04But I do agree with themed streaming, and a page for each department
<Wrek> 05soon we wont even be able to use it
<Bronysith> Yahooz: eeeyup
<Princess_Molestia> not yet, give a minuet
<Ghosties> 04At least a page for each department
*Airpuff hugs alexxm back :P
<RAWRity> Funfact: Pregnancy tests in the early 1900s actally involved killing rabbits.
<Luna> @Wrek there are other platforms too
<Lil_B> Airpuff I thouhgt you are Dr Who... so Why do you try to get to him?
<Caramel> personally, I dislike the idea of having streamers competing for viewer attention, with that being said: I'd like to see everyone's opinion on it
<Bronysith> RAWRity: wtf
<Silverscreen> 1,11Livestream pretty much loaths us at this point.
<Ghosties> 04Hehe
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: sounds lovely.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: ....
<Ninjazz> RAWRity: That doesn't sound fun at ALL!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'm afraid that it would mean competition
<Bronysith> funfact: my brain is full of fuck and i love it
<Silverscreen> 1,11^
<Airpuff> Lil_B: .. no.. im not Dr Who.. i am airpuff, and i pulled a knock knock joke to get to doctor who! xD
<Silverscreen> 1,11That's the issue, and that's the purpose of queue streaming.
<Bronysith> funfact: i like pie
<kirzstryfe> I think having 1 extra page would work, but use it strictly for dept streams
<Wrek> 052 things i can think of is: 1: wont it casue stream competition and 2: what about those that stream both art adn games?
<RAWRity> Bronysith: They would take a blood sample from the woman, inject it into a rabbit, and then if the woman was pregnant, the rabbit's ovaries would expand until they burst.
<funfact> why is everypony pinging me?
<pikorar> Funner Fact: Bronysith likes pie.
*Lil_B knowed it all along Airpuff
<GabeMoist> Ohai funfact
*Airpuff glares at Lil_B ..
<pikorar> Nobody likes a funfact.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Kirzstryfe: There's an idea. Having one other room for theme streams and have a different theme depending on who gonna stream that day.
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm not sure about streams. But a page for each department seems like a great idea, and for things like the gaming and podcast pages, you could just have recordings.
<GabeMoist> I just heard thunder
*Lil_B glares back at Airpuff
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah, I don't think we should invest in such a setup. It would be a logistics nightmare, for starters. Additionally, there's the fact that our viewerbase is limited enough as it is.
<GabeMoist> Storms a comin
<Ninjazz> Hey GabeMoist!
<Michael> dat epic music
<Silverscreen> 1,11...
<Michael> hai GabeMoist
<Silverscreen> 1,11Why not just make a Youtube channel for this?
<luigifan365> I'm falling asleep!!!!!
<GabeMoist> Ohai gais
<DISCORD> DISCORD IN HOUSE
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Jesus. Who the hell found that out.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: Im not the one who made me explain something to somepony who knew all along! :|
<pikorar> Okay, what next.
<Oujo> ...That's an idea...
<Michael> hai DISCORD
<pikorar> Hi DISCORD. I love you.
<Princess_Idunno> Mine ISNT WORKINg :(
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: scientists
<DISCORD> who want play truth or dare
<Luna> yfw we have a youtube channel but it's not being used atm
<hen3ry> I keep hearing Chariots of Fire in this
<kirzstryfe> a page for each dept, but have it link through the same embed swapper for content
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: For science. Right, of course.
<Bronysith> stfu DISCORD
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi DISCORD
<Ghosties> 04We have a YouTube channel
<DISCORD> stfu bronysith
<DerpSurge> I'm getting no stream O__o
<Lil_B> Airpuff I know, I'm good at playing dumm : D
<Silverscreen> 1,11A collection of Let's Plays, Podcasts, Music all promoting different artists through playlists that link to their respective pages.
<Princess_Idunno> Discord Lord of Chaos
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We are starting one for the Interviews, maybe we could link our own youtube videos on the main page
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey DISCORD are you here to doom us all? :O
<pikorar> Only credits are playing DerpSurge.
<Bronysith> Dermathil: did u make a vid for the brony fukireta parade?
<Oujo> Oh wow xDD What's it called? Or is it just called BronyState?
<DISCORD> yes yes i am
<GabeMoist> there is no stream, bronystate is currently experiencing a drought
<Sumica> 00,10this come back to the frontside embed swaper that we talked about at one point.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: .. congrats you tricked me! :D
<GabeMoist> the stream dried up
<Ponies47> DISCORD: :O
<pikorar> Credits for credits?
<GilDash|Bath> Airpuff: To be fair, that's not hard. :p
<Ghosties> 04Wait
<Princess_Idunno> aww My first time here and theres a drought FUCK My life :8
<prince-lemon> Starting one?
<prince-lemon> We already have one
<pikorar> Hi GilDash|Bath. You takin' a bath?
<Silverscreen> 1,11We could put an embed on our page in BS witha link to the Youtube page, and swap the embed out at regular intervals.
<DISCORD> *sumons evil zombie ponys*
<Airpuff> GilDash|Bath: shaddap xDD
<Ghosties> 04Why not just use the BronyState youtube channel for this stuff -_-
<DuskStarshimmer> OO linux
<cachi01> DISCORD: u mean blood hounds?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Ghosties: I think that's the idea we're getting at.
<Ninjazz> Dafuq.
<Ponies47> Ba ba ba ba she she she she ba ba ba ba :P
<Litwick> So, what's next on the menu?
<OldMan> What? Someone here is named DISCORD? lol IMPOSTER!
<Lil_B> Airpuff ... really... I actually thought you would get it :/ or are you the one now who wants to trick me?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Q: Why haven't we started the interview YT channel?
<cachi01> blood hoofs are scary
<fluttercry> 05,15The BronyState channel could just have playlists for each department
<DISCORD> sends zombies at cachi01
<Irish_Pony> hey Saturn can I recommend something?
<Airpuff> Lil_B: What?! xD
<fluttercry> 05,15You upload a video, and sort it to the playlist
<HatsuneMikuFan> Yo Dog, I hear you like credits. So we put an intro credit for the rest of the credits. And we gave you partial credit for the credits
*cachi01 eats DISCORD's zombies
*Michael kills all the zombies
<Ghosties> 04^
<cachi01> yummy
<Silverscreen> 1,11^
<Ghosties> 04Have separate playlists for each channel
<Oujo> That sounds like a good idea.
*pikorar becomes a zombie and starts a lil' zombie family.
<Wrek> 05it wont work for art but for podcasts and game streams, having a separate place on the site for those. where you can go games>genre/streamer>lets play quake 1 which then is a link to the youtube OR even better, on site play
<DISCORD> kicks cachi off earth
<Ghosties> 04For each dept, I mean
<Ponies47> *Flys away from DISCORD*
<Bronysith> Saturn: play super bingo
*cachi01 eats DISCORD
<Saturn> 08,01okay, SB is gonna take over the stream now
<Ninjazz> That's it, I'm done.
<Saturn> 08,01thanks for watching
<Ninjazz> Good night.
<Meanwhile> Thanks for streaming Saturn. :3
<Irish_Pony> yay :3
<Ponies47> YAY :)
<pikorar> Bye-bye Saturn.
<Ninjazz> Thanks, Saturn!
<GabeMoist> Saturn, what stream?
<Silverscreen> 1,11We don't discriminate either. If someone has something they want to add to the "Music" playlist or the "Let's Play" playlist, we let them add it.
<Meanwhile> Night Ninjazz.
<hen3ry> gratzi, Saturn
<Lil_B> Airpuff just be aware that I can read you like an open book... I'll keep an eye on you... like a hawk... or rather, a griffin
<Michael> bye Saturn
<cachi01> SuperBrony64: u gonna play some ssbb????

<HatsuneMikuFan> Thanks Saturn

<cachi01> thx Saturn bye!
<Saturn> 08,01hoep you enjoyed the Science!
<Ponies47> Thanks for thr stream Saturn :)
*Nittany_Discord 11,01fills up with water
<fluttercry> 05,15That's how my personal page is, I have tons of playlists sorting my favorites and uploads
<Oujo> For Art, we could post some speedpaints or video tutorials?
<Michael> thx for the stream :D
<Ponies47> Night night Ninjazz
<pikorar> I always enjoy the science
<Luna> ^
<HatsuneMikuFan> Saturn: I do like Science
<Luna> that's a possibility
<Michael> Gnight Ninjazz
<Saturn> 08,01if i had time, i'd do another Saturn Explains Shit, but i'm up to my eyeballs in work right now
<Ponies47> Saturn; Science = EVIL! :O
<Silverscreen> 1,11We'd have a link to our Deviant Art page.
<DerpSurge> Bye Saturn! :D
<Airpuff> Lil_B: ... wat... who... what?.. When did...... :s
<Luna> Vi's radio stream was another possibility
<Lil_B> Airpuff sorry :/ i think I'm going insane over here
*Saturn 08,01sets mode +b on Ponies47
<DISCORD> lights chat on fire
<Luna> we link to our dA page each week...
<pikorar> Saturn should stream himself doing his work.
<fluttercry> 05,15Lit could have fanfic readings or reviews. Every department has something they could add
<Irish_Pony> Saturn: Go raibh maith agat for the stream!
<Luna> it's just not being UTILIZED at all
<Silverscreen> 1,11The radio stream could feature the playlists if VI is willing.
<Oujo> ...We have a deviantART page?
<Airpuff> Lil_B: I have no idea what you are trying to say! xD
<|Discord|> Hai everypony!
<Ponies47> Saturn: :o
<Luna> lol..
<Airpuff> Hi |Discord|
<DISCORD> say wut
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We also have an unused tumblr.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi |Discord|
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey |Discord|
<pikorar> Hi |Discord|! I love you. There's some sick, disgusting clone of you here.
<Oujo> ...
<kirzstryfe> we have both
<Lil_B> Airpuff ok :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And a barely-used facebook page.
<SlurryMoon> It's actually getting worked on Nitt
<Luna> but yea we are going offtopic
<|Discord|> DISCORD: Ah we got a inposter here don't we?
<Michael> hai |Discord|
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.
<Saturn> 08,01pikorar: it'd be really boring. it's just me sitting in front of my computer chatting with other mods, BUCK committee, and writing e-mails to inland revenue
<Luna> so yay or nay?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Nittany I will be discussing social media soon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: ... What are you trying to say then? xD
<Ghosties> 04Alright, we're veering off
<Wrek> 05sure if we want a lib with speedpaints and i guess i could try a hoof at making tutorials then sure. I would jsut need help organizing and how to actually make the vids in the first place.
<LordCelestia> 0,5And yea Luna
<DuskStarshimmer> Hay, Bronystate, why not stream Alice in Wonderland?
<pikorar> Sounds funner than half my life, Saturn.
<Ghosties> 04The social media thing will be discussed in a bit
<DISCORD> lights ldiscordl on fire
<cachi01> hi |Discord|!!
<Wrek> 05i disagree we are still discussign the point at hadn ghosties
<DuskStarshimmer> or Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory.
<|Discord|> DISCORD: Bro, I am the TRUE discord. You can not beat my awsomeness
*cachi01 gives water to |Discord|
<Midnight_Tempest> funner isnt a word pikorar...
<Ghosties> 04But we won't have anything for social media, Wrek
<alexxm> hey DuskStarshimmer hows your day been
<|Discord|> cachi01: Thank you my dear friend.
<Michael> hai DuskStarshimmer
<Silverscreen> 1,11Luna, this is a good idea. We can turn the BronyState youtube channel into our own gallery of Brony Community videos with the various themes for each playlist.
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey DuskStarshimmer :)
<Sumica> 00,10Guess I was the only one that liked the idea luna had.
<Ponies47> BRB
<fluttercry> 05,15I say yes to individual pages, but I'm hesitant on the streams.
<DISCORD> discord has no freinds hes cahos
<DuskStarshimmer> Ayoo alexxm, hows my bro doin?
<DISCORD> im the real discord
<Luna> it's just a crazy idea
<Luna> but we can discuss the details later
<DuskStarshimmer> 'Allo Michael and How be its Ponies47
<|Discord|> DISCORD: Get with the times man. You are to old school.
<Luna> just needed to know if you like it or not
<Ghosties> 04Yeah
<Sumica> 00,10*headdesk*
<alexxm> i'm goo dDuskStarshimmer
<Irish_Pony> only 97 more views until my DA account has reached 1,000 channel veiws :$
<Ghosties> 04I'm also hesitant to streams
<Sumica> 00,10a meeting to plan meetings
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Me too.
<alexxm> i'm good DuskStarShimmer
<|Discord|> ALL IN FAVOR OF ME BEING REAL Discord SAY "I"
<Silverscreen> 1,11The only issue is...who the hell is going to manage all of it?
<cachi01> Irish_Pony: link it hre i wanna help =D
<Viri> 14the pope is gone
<Viri> 14FINALLY
<DuskStarshimmer> alexxm, good!
<Viri> 14too many people around x_x
<Irish_Pony> cachi01: http://monopoly907.deviantart.com/
<Lil_B> Airpuff I tricked you you in explaining everything to me because i Played dumb, now you are playing dumb and want me to explain everything to you, but thats not gonna happen, even though thats just what I'm doing wriht now, so you won, you are good Oo
<Luna> the tech part or the setup or the managing?
<DuskStarshimmer> I
<Caramel> each department would be in charge of their own channel
<Viri> 14over a milion
<Caramel> and then tech makes the magic happen
<Michael> brb
<kirzstryfe> each dept lead would be responsible for managing the page, with help from tech to set it up
<Luna> ^
<Meanwhile> Und then chat was playing dumb.
<hen3ry> this is not a democracy.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: playing?
<Airpuff> Lil_B: .. i really had no idea what you were saying.. before now.. but okai xDDD
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Ok fine,.
<Meanwhile> Und then chat was dumb.
<hen3ry> we are an anarcho-synd.... no, wait, I suppose we're not that either
<Meanwhile> Are you happy now?
<GilDash|Bath> Ninjazz|Night: G'night if you're still watching. ;)
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: Hey bro is there anyway I can reserve this name?
<DuskStarshimmer> anyone care to play gmod sbep? Gmod SBEP anyone?
<Ghosties> 04So each dept would have its own YouTube channel?
<Silverscreen> 1,11If I manage to get those interviews I'm doing done in a good enough time, I could easily start setting it up. Ghosties, as for social media, we're kinda stuck at just using FB, Twitter and such as our means of marketting until someone gets a better idea for them.
<Lil_B> Airpuff I believe you, I often speak convoluted :/ it's worse when I'm actually speaking
<fluttercry> 05,15no a playlist in the main channel
<Ninjazz|Night> GilDash|Bath: Just about to fall asleep.... Thanks for that.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: xD
<DuskStarshimmer> |Discord|, /nickserv register blah blah blah
<Airpuff> Oo
<cachi01> dat feeling when u eat all ur chips and u have no music and u got owned in one in the chaber after beating everyone up..........

<Ninjazz|Night> NIght HatsuneMikuFan.
<Ninjazz|Night> GilDash|Bath: I don't have dreams.
<Airpuff> GilDash|Bath: .. how are you.. bathing... while you are at BState??
<Ghosties> 04Possibility of using BronyState's playlists for each dept. video stuff
<Ghosties> 04Okay
<Ghosties> 04Now we can continue
<GilDash|Bath> Airpuff: I'm not yet. Just hoping I don't flood everywhere. :D
<alexxm> magic Airpuff
<Michael> only for curiosity
<GilDash|Bath> Ninjazz|Night: Well, you know what I mean. :)
<Airpuff> GilDash|Bath: ahaha okei
<HatsuneMikuFan> Airpuff: He has technology
<Ponies47> Airpuff: Magic *snort* *snort*
<Lil_B> GilDash|Bath just don't flood the chat you you will get banned for spamming XD
<Luna> next item is a simple one
<Luna> Artist's Spotlight Page; What's the status on bringing back our Artist's Spotlight page?
<Ninjazz|Night> GilDash|Bath: Of course, night.
<Ghosties> 04NEVER
<Ghosties> 04Er
*Luna is looking at the techies
<Yahooz> *ahem*

<Ghosties> 04I think Val worked on that too
<Yahooz> mentlegen
<cachi01> Lil_B: i c wat u did there
<ScootaChicken> Sup Yahooz
<|Discord|> Lil_B: ya DISCORD learned that the hard way
<Yahooz> sup man
<kirzstryfe> I was thinking on that, rolling it into the art dept page
<Caramel> It was a topic of mine, yes
<GilDash|Bath> Yahooz: Are we going to kill the Batman?
<Chrysalis> Hai ScootaChicken
<Michael> hai ScootaChicken
<Irish_Pony> SuperBrony64: Moo....
<Om> Ninjazz|Night: Dream of many. Blue Ponies with hats
<ScootaChicken> So Yahooz, Chrysalis, what do you guys think about lemons?
<Meanwhile> Und then Chickens which Scooted.
<Caramel> we promised it to the viewers, so I'd just like to see what the status on it is
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi ScootaChicken
<Wrek> 05could I get a fill in on what the spotlight actually was?
<Silverscreen> 1,11The Artist Spotlight can be brought back with that "Theme" idea.
<Yahooz> lemons are pretty cool
<Yahooz> they make lemonade
<ScootaChicken> Yeah
<Meanwhile> Lemons are very sweet picked straight from the tree.
<Yahooz> Which is Pretty fucking awesome
<ScootaChicken> I remember making lemonade with the boy scouts
<kirzstryfe> was highlighting the winners from the first art contest, if I'm thinking of the same page
<Meanwhile> You mean girl scouts.
<Yahooz> Ah those were the days
<ScootaChicken> O U
<Caramel> yes
<ScootaChicken> Besides, Girl Scouts are called Guides :P
<Caramel> that, and the fanfic contest
<Yahooz> jailbait can be girlscouts too
<Irish_Pony> the only thing I hate about lemonade is that it burns my throat afterwords :p
<Meanwhile> I did not know that.
<Meanwhile> Consider me enlightened.
<Ponies47> I never was in boy scouts. :( I thought it was a dumb idea :|
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03...wut
<Yahooz> that you are
<Ponies47> :$
<ScootaChicken> So, any of you guys like Green Day?
<Meanwhile> Allo Alejandro.
<ScootaChicken> Heya Scoots :3
<HatsuneMikuFan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl5d15lokaY Blametruth is so awesome
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Che!
<Wrek> 05well maybe not contest winners, but the idea of on our page feature an artist. say like ocne a week someone looks around on deviantart. finds a brony artist and we just spotlight them for a week or something.
<Pinkies4thWall> OHAI BRONYSTATE!
<Meanwhile> I liked Greenday, back when they were sorta newish.
<alexxm> well my dads girlfriend is intrested in seeing the show
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And yes, BlameTruth is awesome~
<Wrek> 05kind of developing the spotlight a bit further
<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: Nothing you just go back selling your chicken....
<Meanwhile> Allo Pinkies4thWall.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi Pinkies4thWall
<alexxm> hey Pinkies4thWall hows your day been

<fluttercry> 05,15I actually had an idea about that. Rather than doing more contests. People could send in their art and stories, we could look over them and make sure they are passable. Then put them up. Kind of what Wrek just said
<Chrysalis> Do you like lemons
<prince-lemon> GTFO, lemonade has lemons in.
<Michael> hai Pinkies4thWall
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO! :D
<Meanwhile> Old Mcdonald had a farm, E I E I O. And on that farm he had a SuperBrony64, E I E I O.
<prince-lemon> Must be better
<Yahooz> prince-lemon: NO WAI
<Michael> hai Scoot-Scootaloo
<Luna> pretty much wat EqD is doing?
<Pinkies4thWall> my dad turned off the net last night when avatar was 50 miutes in so i was so saddlesore(butthurt)
<ScootaChicken> prince-lemon: I see you're still keeping your nick lemony.
<Lil_B> If life gives you Melons, make Melonade
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'll be trying to stream the Pre-E3 Show for Nintendo though at 3 PM PDT.
<Chrysalis> prince-lemon you serious?
<Yahooz> lemons are the best fruit to grace this earth
<Meanwhile> With a moo moo here and a moo moo there, here a moo there a moo everywhere a moo moo, Old macdonald had a farm, E I E I O.
<cachi01> SuperBrony64: yay thx =D
<RAWRity> prince-lemon: what's your thoughts on Pink Lemonade?
<prince-lemon> When you put it like that it sounds bad. XD
*Pinkies4thWall hugs prince-lemon
<Ghosties> 04Gives Seth more reason to be like
<Yahooz> RAWRity: its pink
<Ghosties> 04"LOL, UR JUST COPYING US"
<fluttercry> 05,15Why not? Gives people another place to put their stuff. But yeah now it sounds bad
<ScootaChicken> Suddenly RAWRity
<Meanwhile> Pink Lemonade. Is that like a Reverse Nacho Hoof?
<Michael> hai prince-lemon
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: I've been here for over an hour
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 well you be able to make countdown for them?
*Pinkies4thWall hugs everypony who said hi.
<Yahooz> Its like the taco of lemonades
<SlurryMoon> I believe it's better to have a spotlight for one person a week
<Wrek> 05well to an extent. isntead of draw friends. we jsut feature an artist for a week with maybe an iamge of theirs. and a link to their DA. givign the smaller artists some space aswell
<Pinkies4thWall> MOO, SuperBrony64
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Lurking powah to the max?
<SlurryMoon> we post it in a new topic called "Artist Spotlight"
<cachi01> oh hi Pinkies4thWall
<alexxm> hey Pinkies4thWall hows your day been
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EqD doesn't need to be the sole place for art and fanfic submission.
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: I've been talking to people
<Ghosties> 04That is true...
*Irish_Pony works on his Abraham Tank
<Wrek> 05same can be done with fanfics, music.
<Meanwhile> But RAWRity, you're antisocial.
<Ghosties> 04Hell, Seth already doesn't want to have anything to do with us if previous interactions matter
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Meh, I've not been paying attention to the chat
<LordCelestia> 0,5I know the guy who managed the second largest pony art group on dA if that helps at all.
<Lil_B> I'm going back to my Protocols, only 5 more to go. If you need me, ping me, I'm still sitting next to the PC XD
<DerpSurge> Hey, mods! :$
<Pinkies4thWall> alexxm: it just got good. my dad turned on the internet for the house 7 minutes ago.
<Ghosties> 04But still, we need him for promoting us as best stream for new eps
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: No, I'm just incredibly grating. There's a difference.
<Ghosties> 04At least for now
<Pinkies4thWall> Lil_B:
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03OH HAI!
<Meanwhile> Oh right.
<Pinkies4thWall> pibg
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Lil_B: Probably not a countdown... ><
<Pinkies4thWall> *ping
<alexxm> hey DerpSurge hows your day been
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi Scoot-Scootaloo
<DerpSurge> Hey Scoot-Scootaloo!
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11The submission process would be simple and the rules easy to follow: Keep it clean and tasteful.
*Pinkies4thWall glomps SuperBrony64 and brushes his mane
<|Discord|> Scoot-Scootaloo: Hai, I have a question. When I go to regestier my Nickname it asks for a password...but a password to what?
<alexxm> hey Scoot-Scootaloo hows your day been
<fluttercry> 05,15To be hones I haven't been to EqD in a really long time, does anyone know the general quality of what they allow?
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Scoot-Scootaloo and brushes his mane.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03A password for you nickname
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 too bad :/ I always miss such things because i don't know whats the time in MEZ
<Shamroc> moo
<Naetaru> Scwoop!
<Pinkies4thWall> |Discord|: that is so nopony else can use your nick
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I dunno. I don't go there much anymore myself.
<|Discord|> Scoot-Scootaloo: Ah
<Oujo> ^
<Caramel> Stay on topic plz
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Lil_B: If you ask me, I can tell you how much longer :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Right now, it's about 3 hours till the Pre-E3 Nintendo stream
<Wrek> 05who cares about their standards?
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 thanks :D please tell me
<Pinkies4thWall> !cd SuperBrony64
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Moving on.
<Luna> I don't
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai Tom
<Ghosties> 04True, but this can be brought up during discussion about Bronynation
<|Discord|> I registered it
<|Discord|> HELL YA
<fluttercry> 05,15Well I had somewhre I was going with that but I forgot so sorry.
<Meanwhile> Yfw Tom does not give a single buck.
<Lil_B> ok, thats 0:00 in germany i think
<Shamroc> |Discord|: now hope you dont have a large amount of hardships getting it to work
<Wrek> 05did you mean submission process for art of for music/fanfics there silveer?
<Pinkies4thWall> Meanwhile: My face :'(
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11All three.
<Luna> Right next item
<Meanwhile> Pinkies4thWall: ...your face?
<Shamroc> OH HELL YES
<Luna> Forum utilization
<Yahooz> you face
<Litwick> MYTHBUSTERSD? I WUB YOU
<Irish_Pony> GOD THAT SCARED ME!
<alexxm> mythbuster
<Ponies47> YOUR FACE! :[
<DerpSurge> YOUR FAEC
<Luna> Why are the forums barely being used?
<Pinkies4thWall> <Meanwhile> Yfw Tom does not give a single buck. My face: :'(
<Michael> wee it works ;D
<Litwick> Come here SuperBrony64! Let me wub you!
<Meanwhile> Hitler does not care about your bomb.
<Meanwhile> He has wars to lose.
<cachi01> UR FACE
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Mainly because the chat is the main means of communication.
<Ghosties> 04"Too much work"
<Wrek> 05skype.
<DerpSurge> YAY now stream works!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03^
<Ghosties> 04Or Skype, yeah
<Irish_Pony> Whos streaming?
<Ponies47> Hugs Pinkies4thwall
<Luna> As you all know i'm sick and i'm having a hard enough time trying to skim through SRS due to the amount of OFFTOPIC messages
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pretty much Skype.
<RyunosukeKnT> so I heard Bronystate needs more explosions
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<Ponies47> *Explodes*
*alexxm nuzzles Pinkies4thWall
*SuperBrony64 hugs Litwick ^-^
<Lil_B> Nazi Photos are best Photos
<RyunosukeKnT> oh
<Rain`> hey, SB, do you know when the Sony confrence is on E3?
<cachi01> this is the part Nittany_Discord is supposed to explode
<Ponies47> *Explodes*
<DerpSurge> SuperBrony64: hi silly filly :D
<Ghosties> 04For now, Skype is just easier to communicate
<Pinkies4thWall> sumi, i like Jamie's moustache
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11That is a good point. I myself just browse past and ask what I missed at the end of it all.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Same,.
<Pinkies4thWall> WHOAH
<cachi01> Rain`: they will just talk about playstation all star battle royale :l
<Ghosties> 04So if you really want forums utilized then that means we ask others to go to forums more
<DerpSurge> WHOA
<Ghosties> 04But then
<RyunosukeKnT> later today on mythbusters: http://theartrix.deviantart.com/art/Today-on-Mythbusters-ponies-200939257
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even if SRS stays on-topic, I can wake up to a 100+ message queue.
*Kipkat07_Mare rolls on the floor
<Ghosties> 04That probably wouldn't happen :/
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Rain`: 6 PM PDT Monday June 4th :)
<HatsuneMikuFan> Doppler Effect?
<Rain`> ^_^
<Meanwhile> E3. Meh.
<prince-lemon> Well, Skype might be easier.
<prince-lemon> But that doesn't necessarily mean better.
*Irish_Pony licks SuperBrony64
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11I think that, if we are to use the forum, we should use them as a place for final discussions and final decisions, that way we don't have to bother cutting through the bullshit to know what's going on.
<prince-lemon> Because clearly our communication is terrible.
<Pinkies4thWall> inb4 it does
<Sumica> 00,10cool way to show the science
<Ghosties> 04It doesn't, but people will use convenience if they can
<prince-lemon> As that comes up time and time again
<Litwick> The Situation Room
<Ponies47> MLP FIM Music, y u so good and catchy!?! I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THEM! 6_9
<DerpSurge> Sumica: agreed.
<Ponies47> science *snort* *snort*
<Wrek> 05an idea would be to move SRS to the forums. and stop using SRS in skype. having the SRS of skype contain say "please put this IP on the ban lsit cause im streaming" or minor srs matters
<Meanwhile> Da Fuhrer.
<Dark_Horst> i know someone whose dead works for microsoft. soi he gets a free e3 press pass every year. lucky fucker
<Dark_Horst> *dad
<Meanwhile> In de Fuhrers face.
*Kipkat07_Mare rolls on Sumica and SuperBrony64
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or to post movie night winners.
*Kipkat07_Mare rolls in a circle on the floor
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<Wrek> 05aye
<Ponies47> *Rolls on floor and hums*
<alexxm> well my dads girlfriend is intrested in seeing the show
<Meanwhile> I wonder if that'd work on caht.
*Pinkies4thWall slaps sense into SuperBrony64
<Meanwhile> chat*
<prince-lemon> Well we used have a thread on the forums for sort of 'daily' BronyState events that people should know about or be read up on.
<DerpSurge> alexxm: good for her!
*BarbetosAMERICANSKI crashes through wall
<prince-lemon> But I don't think it was used much
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> OHHH YEAH!!
<Ghosties> 04Yep
<SirGanjalf> SLAP
<Michael> bitchslap
<Ghosties> 04It's not used much
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11the SRS skype group seems to be only usefull during emergencies and when we need instant communication on an issue.
<|Discord|> alexxm: What show?
*alexxm slaps Meanwhile
<Ghosties> 04So then
<prince-lemon> Maybe we should reinforce the use of something like that
<Meanwhile> Ow.
*Irish_Pony slaps everypony in chat
<Ghosties> 04Have a SRS SRS group
<Pinkies4thWall> SLAP FIGHT
*BarbetosAMERICANSKI explodes from slap
<Meanwhile> I regret wondering.
<alexxm> |Discord| my little pony
<Dark_Horst> druuuugs
<prince-lemon> What?
<Chrysalis> Ninja Post: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/21402779.jpg
<Luna> no
*Michael avoids Irish_Pony slap
<Luna> not another group
<alexxm> how did that feel Meanwhile
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11No more skype groups.
<Ponies47> BarbetosAMERICANSKI: FIX THAT WALL NOW?!? :[
*Pinkies4thWall slaps Irish_Pony
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11No. More.
<LordCelestia> 0,5To be honest I prefer skype over the forums
<Dark_Horst> i like her painted on tie
<prince-lemon> Most of us live in different time zones.
<Ghosties> 04Everyone probably does
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01More skype groups are bad.
<Ponies47> *SLAPS EVERYPONY*
<Meanwhile> alexxm: Like being clocked in the chops.
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> Ponies47 I am aslpoded. Can't help you.
<Irish_Pony> Chrysalis: XD
<prince-lemon> We need somewhere where we can read goings on without all the crap
*Yahooz slaps the RPers around a bit with a large trout
<Baka-Neku> SuperBrony64: hey my love =D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We don't need a SRS for SRS.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Exactly.
<prince-lemon> So I'd say a forum thread.
*alexxm slaps Ponies47 hows it feel
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz and Chrysalis: The RP is kind of annoying...
*Michael avoids Ponies47 slap
<ScootaChicken> also
<prince-lemon> As we used to have
*ScootaChicken hugs Baka-Neku
<fluttercry> 05,15I say keep using SRS they way we do, but log really really important stuff in the forums
<Yahooz> Trufax ScootaChicken
<prince-lemon> Which is updated with the daily events
<Ponies47> alexxm: Bad :'( I'm sorry :'(
<Meanwhile> The RP is very annoying.
<prince-lemon> And which everyone should read/update
<Baka-Neku> ScootaChicken: hey love =D
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11What fluttercry said.
*Michael slaps Irish_Pony and Ponies47
*StupidSexyCJ is slapped
<Wrek> 05assign someone to post the daily list?
<Litwick> Tell them that she secretly had an affair.
*alexxm hugs Ponies47 sorry about that
<Yahooz> honestly whats the point of RP?
<Ponies47> is slapped :'(
<Litwick> That'll work.
<Chrysalis> the RP is incredibly annoying
<Yahooz> just be yourself man?
<Eddmario> Keri can bust my myth anytime.
<ScootaChicken> I dunno...
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> A slapping robot. I need one of them. Installed at my door.
<Eddmario> Wait, what?
<cachi01> what myth are they trying to bust?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01feels like +m ing the channel for RP
<RyunosukeKnT> they are building a slapping machine?
<Dark_Horst> have you ever been so mad that you built a faceslapping robot?
<Meanwhile> The amount of which I am annoyed is too damn high.
<Yahooz> Nittany_Discord: do iit
<Ponies47> *Hugs alexxm* It's ok :)
<|Discord|> Yahooz: So I can act like discord and win every time
<prince-lemon> Hmm
<Meanwhile> Hairy arms.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11I'm going to be busy regulating the Youtube thing, so the daily list won't be something I can keep an eye on as well.
<pikorar> Dem soundeffects.
<Dark_Horst> imma slap you so hard. WITH MAH ROBOT!
<Pinkies4thWall> O_O KARI'S GETTING SHAVED
<Eddmario> Is anyone else getting some random YTP and buffering moments?
<Meanwhile> Dat pun
<pikorar> I SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE!
<Baka-Neku> Nittany_Discord: can easily be done just voice everyone and devoice the rp'ers
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Baka-Neku :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't mind one-line things.
<Meanwhile> Slap the bass.
<Ponies47> I can't believe we're finally here.With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is starting to make this the Best Night Ever!
<Ghosties> 04Okay, so
<Michael> hai Baka-Neku
<Eddmario> I think there's a problem with the stream.
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> Spank-o-meter
<pikorar> Is that homer simpson?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or two-line.
<Baka-Neku> SuperBrony64: how are you too day
<Ghosties> 04How about
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm good ^-^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01/me isn't RP. /me interactions are.
<Ponies47> Fine I won't sing :'(
*SuperBrony64 hugs Baka-Neku
<Meanwhile> Bam hands.
<Eddmario> It's either randomly buffering or jumps a few seconds ahead
<Ran> 2!pokemon
<Ran> 2!eonget
<ScriptBot> Ran, you are a 10Skorupi.
<ScriptBot> 4Ran just got a male 2Glaceon
*Baka-Neku hugs SuperBrony64 back
<Chrysalis> oooh this slap is PAINFUL
<Ran> 2:3
<Meanwhile> Smack.
<alexxm> horray
<Ghosties> 04Keep using SRS, but use the forums for the most important info and direct everyone there for the finale of a discussion
<Meanwhile> rofl
<Michael> dem slap
<Ghosties> 04That way both SRS and the forums are used
<Meanwhile> Backhand
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Exactly.
<Litwick> Double slap
<Meanwhile> Pimp robot.
<Ponies47> what do the vast hoofs say to the face? SLAP! :d
<alexxm> i like this show
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K.
<StupidSexyCJ> I need that for an alarm clock
<Ghosties> 04OKAY, next
<prince-lemon> If this is going to work we need to be pretty strict with checking/posting information to the forums though
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11If thats the case, we should be using it to record the decisions we're making right now.
<Pinkies4thWall> INB4 WEED
<Litwick> Right in the eye!
<pikorar> Dey gon' get drunk?
<Meanwhile> Now increase the force to match a crocodile bite. :3
<Om> Their pain is amusing.
<cachi01> BOOM oh no
<Michael> lol
<SirGanjalf> That hand acts more like a fish, than an actual hand
<alexxm> advert why is there an advert
<Ghosties> 04That's why I'm also cataloguing (however you spell that damn word) the results of each topic
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> Almond Joy is gross.
<Pinkies4thWall> Meanwhile: is /me rp'ing?
<Litwick> Commercials? NOOOOOOOOO
<Ghosties> 04So that way it's easier to go back and just pick the result of each topic
<Chrysalis> is this streamed off the TV @S
<Vinyer> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Vinyer, you are a 14Medicham.
<Eddmario> I'm guessing this is being streamed from the T
<Vinyer> uh oh
<Eddmario> *TV
<Michael> are we watching tv?
<Meanwhile> Pinkies4thWall: Depends on the context.
*Eddmario wishes I was a pony
<Luna> Alright last point
<Wrek> 05wait
<alexxm> Pinkies4thWall only of you interact with someone with it
<Ponies47> Best candy is NOT Almond Joy! :[
<cachi01> thast over 90!!
<Wrek> 05luna
<Wrek> 051 last thign
<SirGanjalf> It
*Ghosties cries
<Luna> go ahead
<cachi01> shut up kid
<SirGanjalf> It
<Meanwhile> Troll kid.
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> Why? Being a pony would suck. I'd rather be human anyday.
<ScootaChicken> Basically, stuff like /me hugs x person is alright.
<Wrek> 05I do think it would be "easier" or atleast more attractive to use the forums if it was located on bronystate rather than on zetaboards
<Ponies47> LASER! :D
<ScootaChicken> But prolonged interaction via the /me command is RP
*Eddmario Twilight: You're such a good father. How bout you and me give Nyx a sibling *looks at Dusk with bedroom eyes*
<Saturn> 08,01can i make a suggestion: how about we keep all our canonical info on a wiki? they're dead easy to set up; i could have one going on our NFS in about 10 minutes
*alexxm hugs Ponies47
<Ghosties> 04Then users would be asking to join
*Nittany_Discord 11,01slaps everyone with a wet towel.
<ScootaChicken> It's also annoying as fuck.
<pikorar> Fun Fact: The highest recorded psi in a human's bite is multiple times higher than the strongest bite recorded on a shark bite.
<Ponies47> *Hugs alexxm*
<Pinkies4thWall> Oh, ok now i klnow what rp'ing is
<DerpSurge> YES, SMASH THOSE TROPHIES
<Chrysalis> ooh nice Nittany_Discord
<ScootaChicken> Nittany_Discord: Since when was BronyState a locker room?
<Luna> the forums as they are now are only meant for the team
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Yeah, that's a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad idea.
<Meanwhile> Eddmario: Thanks for sorting out ScootaChicken's point.
<Saturn> 08,01weren't we going to include public forums as part of BS2.0?
<StupidSexyCJ> Painful and refreshing
<SirGanjalf> that ad seems legit
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Oh were gonna slap like that are we?
<Meanwhile> D'as one dumb dude.
<Luna> we have a item for that later
<Wrek> 05we were iirc
<Sumica> 00,10was what I though at one point as well.
<Wrek> 05ok lets wait with that discussion then
<Pinkies4thWall> OW! Nittany_Discord, those can cut you know.
<Luna> TODO:
<Luna> need to update overview sheet...
<Luna> need to update rules
<Luna> need to update infraction document
<Luna> update FAQ with summer newsletter info
<ScootaChicken> Eddmario: That's RP.
<Eddmario> The singer for the new Free Credit Report band looks like Johnathan Coulton
<Luna> Just need folks for this to step up and do it

<ScootaChicken> It's also annoying as fuck.
<Wrek> 05what is the overwiew sheet?
<Luna> department overview sheet..
<Sumica> 00,10oh you all just realised this was live tv?
<fluttercry> 05,15Johnathan Coulton would be a fantastic Free Credit Report guy. Just sayin
<Meanwhile> Now the question, how long before one of the Mythbusters die?
<pikorar> inb4 he dies painfully.
<Caramel> the FAQ seems like a Lit Team job. Flutter, can your team handle it?
<Chrysalis> oooh dis is gunna be gud
<Chrysalis> ooh you streaming the new ep?
<Magical_pab|STUDING> I'm back from my dinner but i gotta go to study...so act as i wasn't come back! :D:D

<Pinkies4thWall> I made someone bleed by whipping him with a wet towel once
<HatsuneMikuFan> PinkiePry: Ow
<Magical_pab|STUDING> Michael: u maybe ain't get it...
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: how you do this?
<HatsuneMikuFan> Pinkies4thWall: Ow
<Wrek> 05Updating the rules seems like a team job aswell. I could help with that.
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> Scale room with a scale explosion. Now that is pretty cool.
<Sumica> 00,10capture card
<cachi01> I NEED FOOOOOD
<cachi01> BRB
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah the FAQ is no problem.
<Caramel> okay then. Wrek: can you get a group of people together to do that?
<pikorar> Me and a friend played bloody knuckles until our knuckles litterally started bleeding once.
<Eddmario> BTW, the italics thing I said earlier was a slighly modified quote from my scrapped fanfic, specifically the sex scene.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll capture your card.
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: how much did it cost?
<Caramel> Fluttercry: excellent, I'll ask for updates during the mini-meetings
<Ghosties> 04I don't want to leave out those that were there last time
<Ghosties> 04So myself, Super, and whoever else as well as Wrek and...whoever
<Wrek> 05I'd love if shizuka and an admin were helping with that if possiblwe
<Michael> brb
<Ghosties> 04Myself and Super would be there
<Ghosties> 04And we're both admins
<Ghosties> 04In fact
<Ghosties> 04I'm the leader of the Rules group
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord thats a little personal there

<fluttercry> 05,15I was about to say, don't we have a Rules group in skype?
<Ghosties> 04OH YEAH
<Ghosties> 04We do
<Pinkies4thWall> HOPEFULLY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was in the rules group on Skype.
<Ghosties> 04We have a rules group
<Meanwhile> Bamf.
<Luna> Alright that's all for my items.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11The Infraction document would also fall under Ghosties then, wouldn't it.
<Ghosties> 04So then everybody in rules group and Wrek and Shizuka
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Since the two kind go hoof-in-hand.
<pikorar> That explosion matched the explosion in my head when my mind was blown.
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, the stream infractions would fall under Da Rules group for updating, but we obviously wouldn't include that in the public rules
<Wrek> 05the reason why i picked shizu is due to her having handled the rules previously
<Irish_Pony> transducer
<Wrek> 05if she wants to that is
<SirGanjalf> doink!
<Wrek> 05always this ^
*alexxm has a tower of beer cans in his room
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> drama data
<Chrysalis> DOINK
<Ghosties> 04So then the Rules Group would handle updating the rules, I'll make an appointment tonight
<cachi01> im back
<cachi01> with cukis
<Ghosties> 04May we move on, Luna?
<Wrek> 05as i feel right now i feel like begining tonight even, we shall se.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Welcome back cachi01
<Litwick> This'll be fun.
<Meanwhile> Does robot hand have to slap a myth?
<pikorar> Welcome back cachi01. I still love you. And your cookies.
<Ghosties> 04I can't do tonight, I have a test
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How much would a good game capture card cost?
<Ghosties> 04Do tomorrow at noon
<Wrek> 05okiloki
<Ghosties> 04But anyways
<Ghosties> 04Luna?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If it's cheap, I could get one to stream PS3 games.
<Luna> yea lord celestia is next
<cachi01> pikorar: lol yay!
<pikorar> A DOUBLE RAINBOW!
<Ghosties> 04Alright
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11LC, you're up.
<Pinkies4thWall> they should make a catch and make the person sitting press a release button. :D
<LordCelestia> 0,5Alrighty
<Chrysalis> man, american adverts...
<Ghosties> 04***Rules Group will handle rules, make an appointment tonight***
<Ghosties> 04There
<Ghosties> 04Alright Bacon
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: whats your psn?
<pikorar> U
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nittany Tiger
<pikorar> S
<pikorar> A
<LordCelestia> 0,5So, my idea for a new team to handle social media matters
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My PS3 is broke.
<cachi01> oh
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFf
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So if you add me, don't expect to be added for a while.
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: how much did your capture card cost?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<pyrocatboy> I'm back.
<Meanwhile> I'm front.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Nittany_Discord: http://www.roxio.com/enc/products/game-capture/console/overview.html
<pikorar> Welcoem back pyrocatboy. Love you.
<cachi01> i'm middle
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Do you have LBP2?? Perchance???
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have the first.
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Aw :(
<Luna> Ah yes our PR needs to change
<Ghosties> 04I had an idea for that
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<Dken2021> oh cool, live TV
<LordCelestia> 0,5To begin, allow me to say that this is only an idea I've had recently. If we want to keep putting ourselves as a team out in the internet, social media sites are obviously useful. Now, I understand that the Literature Department handles this stuff (I think) but since they have other things that will need to be taken care of (becaue of our future plans) I thought "Hey, we could have a
<LordCelestia> 0,5whole separate team for social media sites" This doesn't have to be an official department, rather maybe a team of our staff who go separately onto sites like Facebook, (Which I already do alongside Luna) and Twitter, Ponysquare, Google Plus, Deviantart, Youtube, Tumblr, and other sites of the like. There could be a leader of this team who gives out information and special announcements,
<LordCelestia> 0,5and then orders the rest of the team to spread out and go put the posts onto the different sites... or no leader, and the team just shares all special information with eachother and then make it a responsibility to get the things out and onto our sites. People who would go into this team would be those who are working on the tumblr, whoever manages our DA and Facebook pages, and whoever is
<Meanwhile> Allo FillyFlam.
<LordCelestia> 0,5willing to watch over other sites like twitter, ponysquare, etc.
<Dken2021> hai FillyFlam
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi FillyFlam
<Wrek> 05HOLY F. ok reading.
<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: I've had an XBL friend request pending for like 5 days. Just not busy on Xbox?
<pikorar> Hi FillyFlam! I love you!
<Chrysalis> Hiya FillyFlam
<Ghosties> 04I really agree with Bacon and I have an idea to help
<drfsupercenter> 03=.=
<FillyFlam> pikorar: ...Thanks, I guess. :P
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile?
<Ghosties> 04May we speak freely, Bacon?
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis.
<LordCelestia> 0,5This could make social media management a lot easier I believe.
<Eddmario> Aerosmith AND Run DMC version? NICE!
<Meanwhile> Shepard.
<Chrysalis> huh, your not I_h8_trixie?
<ScootaChicken> Wrex.
<Irish_Pony> God I love old cars......
<LordCelestia> 0,5I dont think I have anything else to add to the text wall at the moment, so alrighty, you can speak.
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: No. I'm not.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd go back to sleep but it's already almost 3:30 LOL
<Meanwhile> But I love whoever is.
<ScootaChicken> I have PSN
<I_H8_Trixie> Mythbusters? AW YEAH! :D
<pyrocatboy> Irish_Pony Don't we all...
<ScootaChicken> I'm barely ever on the PS3 though
<Sumica> 00,10nitt you could probably get somthing close to what I use for around 40-50 depending on how and who you get it from.
<Ghosties> 04I would like the creation of a PR team, as Bacon said, and...well...I'd like Scoot-Scootaloo to lead it
<ScootaChicken> My names crazzytus on it though, if any of you want to add me.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Back when we first started, I made it a big routine to go from Facebook, Ponychan, Steam, and Skype to spread the word of BronyState. I also made it a big deal for anyone to spread it anywhere as much as they could You're asking for the exact same thing on a bigger scale.
<LordCelestia> 0,5PR ?
<Sumica> 00,10the real issue and you would have to talk to SB on this is HD input.
<Pinkies4thWall> inb4 drunk
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Public Relations.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pinkies4thWall: Not really. My Xbox isn't broken. I just don't play it. I also don't have a paid account.
<Meanwhile> Dat stock knuckle crack
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So I can't do much except chat.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Now of course, this would probably involve making *dun dun dun* a new skype group.
<Sumica> 00,10I recall SB had a strange interlacing look on some ps3 games coming from them being in HD
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Hell no.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm behind this idea, I made a mention of something like this last meeting and on the forum post for this meeting
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11This could easily be resolved by talking in SRS
<Ghosties> 04It would mean a new skype group, yes
<Ghosties> 04No, it can't
<Irish_Pony> dem stars
<Ghosties> 04Things get lost in SRS, Silver
<Eddmario> That's odd, i've got my TV set to Discovery Channel right now, but this episode isn't what's on
<Caramel> No, it would need another skype group
<Wrek> 05dedicated people for PR sounds like a good idea.
<Ghosties> 04And PR is crucial
<LordCelestia> 0,5Whats the big deal with another skype group?
<fluttercry> 05,15yeah, I agree, PR is really important and it would make sense to have a team for it.
<Ghosties> 04It's just a dedication to communication is needed
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the Skupe group would only be for the people in that department right?
<Irish_Pony> oh wow......
<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: that's what i do with every brony from here. chat.
<I_H8_Trixie> These guys have the BEST job ever! I want to be one of them! :S
<pikorar> He's asian... Of course he's good at math.
<Irish_Pony> dat math....
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It really is important to have one, since we need dedicated people on it
<Wrek> 05since it would basically be a new department a new skypoe group is ok. while for a SRS SRS its not.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Agreed.
<Meanwhile> Frosty.
<Dken2021> chilly
<pikorar> inb4 they forget him.
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> Shiver his timbers?
<Ghosties> 04The skype group would need an admin in it to oversee, just like the rest of the depts
<LordCelestia> 0,5Wow, I honestly didn't expect everyone to be happy about this idea.
<Meanwhile> And he was never seen again.
<Ghosties> 04I've been keen on it for a while
<HatsuneMikuFan> I_H8_Trixie: I rather work at RoosterTeeth
<LordCelestia> 0,5:>
<Irish_Pony> IceRamen, I can see these flying off the shelves
<Ghosties> 04And like I said, my candidate for TL is Scoot
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01LC, it's organization and advertisement.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Well, considering I was pretty much THE marketing person back when BMN started, I guess I could lend a hand. Of course, that means adding me back onto the Facebook page.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Unless anyone objects, I accept~
<Irish_Pony> xD
<I_H8_Trixie> LOL :D
<pikorar> DOHOHOHOHO
<Ghosties> 04I wouldn't mind Silver being in it, but I'm only curious as to how long you'd be there for
<Dken2021> oh god
<cachi01> CFFFFFFFFFFFF
<Sumica> 00,10falling on your plot should end the cordnation test
<cachi01> XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Ghosties> 04You mentioned that you would be here for as long as Summer
<Ghosties> 04That's why I'm weighing out options
<LordCelestia> 0,5As long as you can work with us Silver. I mean, the newsletter posting is my job already.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Good point.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I used to play equally with Xbox 360 and PS3, but it's fallen to the PS3 now. I'm not even playing my 360 while my PS3 is broke.
<pikorar> Ducky!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01quacks
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Meanwhile> Results are, you suck.
<Ghosties> 04And Scoot really seems to get around and know people
<I_H8_Trixie> lolwut?
<Ghosties> 04And he's really enthusiastic
<cachi01> im playing ps3 while on the computer
<pikorar> Slapping a man who has an impaired mind is going to be fun.
<cachi01> and y bro is using the xbox
<Om> Smak im!
<Pinkies4thWall> Except SaxyPretender, who i hope to one day play ace combat with
<Meanwhile> Bam.
<Ghosties> 04So if no one else has any objections to Scoot and a reason to be, speak up
<pony_494263> Uhhh
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It was interlacing because I was using Composite, which only supports 480i
<Ghosties> 04Otherwise, BRB, spaghetti
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11I'm not going to lie, the whole process of creating the newsletter was a pain in the ass when we first came up with the idea, but I'm really, REALLY happy with the final result.
*GilDash smacks Om.
<Dken2021> this isn't grant's best day
<Dark_Horst> i almost feel sorry for him. almost
<Luna> heh you can't compare the old newsletter with the current one..
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont feel sorry for anyone
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11No, you can't. XD
<Om> GilDash: Not sure if its good to see you back...
<Irish_Pony> xD
<pony_494263> the heck do you change your name?
<Dark_Horst> show me your warcry!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't remember our pre-2.0 newsletters.
<GilDash> Om: Of course it is. :)
<Meanwhile> Jump up and hit something.
<Luna> it was txt
<Luna> with a logo
<kirzstryfe> I do lol
<fluttercry> 05,15walls o text
<pikorar> They should have released live bears into the testing grounds. That would get his adreniline going.
<Eddmario> At this rate he's sterile now
<Dken2021> pony_494263 you type /nick first, no spaces
<pony_494263> ok
<Chrysalis> his pain is so amusing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll have to dig through my old e-mails.
<pony_494263> now what?
<Pinkies4thWall> anypony know where i can get a good capture card and for how much?
<Om> GilDash: Whatever you say.

<alexxm> why FlareChaser
<pikorar> If I was in a biker gang I would drive a pick up truck and then killing other biker gang members would be so much easier.
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> TheRainbowDash did you sleep on your keyboard?
<cachi01> sora is best keyblade weilder

<TheRainbowDash> BarbetosAMERICANSKI: No...:
<supersora10> IKR?
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11PR is mainly getting people interested in what's going on.
<Caramel> events and contests are things teamleaders should be discussing in the TL group
<Eddmario> Is this just Discovery Channel, or is it one of it's alternate ones?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Uh
<supersora10> But roxas is much cooler.
<Caramel> since it involves multiple departments

<GilDash> Om: That doesn't mean I'll actually do it! Geeze...
<pikorar> But I only do it when the mods are asleep, GilDash, there's a difference.

<cachi01> Eddmario: lol
<Yokupony> but it's weird hearing it with thw American narrator :\
<LordCelestia> 0,5One more thing I want to mention: The people in this department would need to be members of at least a few of our social media sites, or have one or two people assigned to a specific site, and then have them work on it / manage it, which I meant to say earlier.
<Meanwhile> Mods are posts, sleep ponies. Wait what?
<supersora10> Trolololol

<pikorar> This commercial needs more friction.
<LordCelestia> 0,5:D

<Randomnerd> Hey all

<Caramel> stream etiquette
<Caramel> Streaming is an integral part of Bronystate. In the past, we've had issues with people attention whoring in the chat and in general being a nuisance. I'm not saying this is an issue again, but we need to be careful about this. When someone is streaming, it is our responsibility to show the streamer the utmost respect. A lot of times, certain mods will distract from the stream's with
<pikorar> -_________- My whale is bigger.
<Caramel> their own agendas. If the chat naturally migrates to content away from a stream, that is fine. However, no mod should ever be responsible for drawing attention away from a stream. It's down-right rude.
<Caramel> I wanted to bring this to attention
*Tarku hugs everypony :3
<Meanwhile> Inb4 a giant whale.
<pikorar> (-_- )< Fishy!
<Caramel> PLEASE watch yourselves while in the chat
<Dken2021> hehehe go cameraman
<Caramel> it's vital that we always give respect to our streamers
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Meanwhile> Well this seems safe.
<Om> I fear I have made an error.
<pikorar> inb4 911.
<supersora10> What error?
<Caramel> does anyone have any comments to add to that, if not, I can move on?
<HatsuneMikuFan> Meanwhile: ikr
<supersora10> the blue screen of doom?
<GilDash> Om: You spoke. There's your error. ;)
<Wrek> 05not sure what your point is. just "dont attention whore in chat please" or do you want os to comments on soemthing specific?"
<Om> GilDash: Would you preffer it if I didn't.
<supersora10> =0
<pikorar> Om, you came on Bronystate. That's it.
<supersora10> yes.
<supersora10> XD
<FlareChaser> ...now im hungry
<Eddmario> [This comment requires a BronyState Gold account to view]
<RAWRity> No matter what you say about the US, there's one thing we have over the UK: we don't have to deal with Jedward
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: goodie
<alexxm> who wants a slap
<Caramel> Keep your actions related to the stream
<Yokupony> ..... ._.
<FlareChaser> pikorar: LOL CaME on Bronystate
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11pretty much that, Wrek.
*Bronysith slaps alexxm
<Irish_Pony> God that makes me hungry
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: ready yet
<Caramel> this is why we've started getting more strict on RP
<MicTheSpectator> Alright, 5 more minutes and I'm offline.
<Wrek> 05ok no furtehr from me regarding that
<Dken2021> jeward?
<Om> pikorar: Thank you capitain obvious.
*alexxm slaps Bronysith hows it feel
<FlareChaser> I made tehRequital|Drawing ragequit
<GilDash> FlareChaser: Even I wouldn't make that a joke. :D
<Caramel> because it's distracting and disrespectful
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Jedward are Ireland's problem, not ours.
<Princess_Molestia> not yet, ill tell you when
<FlareChaser> GilDash: :3 I would
<MicTheSpectator> I must work.
<Caramel> alrighty, any other questions/concerns?
<alexxm> Bronysith ready for what
<pikorar> Om *captain -- Another error.
<MicTheSpectator> In maybe 10 Minutes.
<Meanwhile> Herp derp face.
<Eddmario> http://eddmario.deviantart.com/favourites/#/d4ncci9
<Cobellanez> Bronysith: What was the email again?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stuff related to the stream is OK, though?
<Caramel> of course
<GilDash> pikorar: Yeah, Omffee is terrible at spelling. :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And if the streamer allows it?
<Randomnerd> Kari and Tori must have rock hard nipples.
<Caramel> it keeps the chat focused on the stream
<Bronysith> Cobellanez: it was flutterisbestpony@gmail.com
<Om> pikorar: Oh look at that. I'm all out of care to give.
<alexxm> Princess_Molestia what does Bronysith want to know your ready for
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Yeah, like the discussions we had conserning chinese medicine and martial arts during Karate Kid.
<supersora10> WE GOT A TROLL IN HERE.
<Irish_Pony> alexxm: dont ask........
<MicTheSpectator> alexxm: I know I am.
<Princess_Molestia> you know
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11It was related to the stream, but kinda distracting.
<pikorar> Om: if this was a movie it would be: pikorar and the Quest for Fucks to Give.
<cachi01> brb time for moar food
<Alchemist> supersora dont we always?
<supersora10> MAIBEH.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We have a lot of streams going on, so we can't do away with idle non-stream-related chat.
<Wrek> 05that actually doesnt bother me too much silver. i think its more about if someone is streamign a game then i go in to link my latest image
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I understand purposely drawing attention away.
<MicTheSpectator> Fucking pedostache.
<Caramel> yeah, I was more refering to what Wrek said
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<ponyremix> MicTheSpectator.. hello mic
<Dken2021> hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: heyllo

<Chrysalis> heya TGAPT
<Irish_Pony> brb
<alexxm> hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT hows your day been
<Meanwhile> Allo TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<Om> pikorar: If this was a movie I would be the dead extra.
<Caramel> okay- anything else regarding this?
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: Hello. I just arrived 2 minutes ago.
<pikorar> No, Om, you would be the love interest.
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: or did you just join?
<GilDash> pikorar: It'd end in five seconds, because I'd be right there with you. ;)
<ponyremix> MicTheSpectator.. i just joined
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11oh yeah. I was *this* close to kicking that idiot that kept posting that stupid pic on Friday.

<Randomnerd> No Hitlers, kay.
<Om> pikorar: You high?
<Bronysith> ANYPONY UP FOR L4D2 anypony at all?
<supersora10> Now stop
<Eddmario> pikorar: If this was a movie, I'd be the star
<cachi01> im back with carls jr
<supersora10> hatin is bad
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: Fuck it, my fanbase is getting lazy.
<Chrysalis> Bronysith sure
<Sumica> 00,10think of it as off site advertising and posting videos, ask the streamer first
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bronysith: PC or Xbox?
<pikorar> GilDash... I'm afraid it may become a porno. :(
<Caramel> speak now or forever hold you peace
<Randomnerd> Now I need some freaking burgers...
<Bronysith> HatsuneMikuFan: pc ftw
<supersora10> Hilters are unneeded. if you are a hilter U MUST DIE
<Caramel> and yes, exactly sumica
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> alexxm just woke up and i have a headache aside from that good, and yours ?
<GilDash> pikorar: We can keep it tasteful. ;)
<Eddmario> Literally.
<pikorar> I'm high on lovin' you, Om.
<ponyremix> MicTheSpectator.. so what are you doing
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: u up for l4d2?
<Lil_B> love and tolerate hitler
<Yokupony> *is hungry now*
<Randomnerd> We're slow-cooking NC Style Barbecue tonight.
<alexxm> pikorar what would i be if this was a movie
<Caramel> alright, moving on
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bronysith: Only have Xbox :(. Getting a PC soon
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: It should be just around OBVIOUS.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Bronysith uhmmm ok
*Om walks away
<Caramel> Where are we going? This is an important question. The admins have been pushing for integration with BronyNation. We want to create something valuable to our community, something that brings the community's focal point back to the users (heh...Tron). With that being said, I want to open up the chat so everyone can express just where they see Bronystate going and what they wish to get
<Caramel> out of this.
<pikorar> You would be the guy who asks stupid questions, alexxm, lol.
<Sumica> 00,10this should be good.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: you up for l4d2?
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: Watching a livestream.
<GilDash> pikorar: Or we could always fade to black. There might be a *lot* of fading to black, but... ;)
<Randomnerd> Holy crap.
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Eh, maybe in a bit.
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: Having to work soon.
<Caramel> and by chat, I meant this meeting
<supersora10> om is a ghost!
<ponyremix> MicTheSpectator.. work sucks
<Caramel> so, where do you guys see Bronystate going?
<Lil_B> Bronysith i have time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Details of BronyNation.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01?
<Caramel> sure
<pikorar> GilDash, it would just be black, with moaning noises. For 2 hours.
<Bronysith> Lil_B: whats ur steam id?
<Yokupony> boom
<Irish_Pony> FIRE IN DA HOLE!
<RustyMeat> I think hes dead...
<Pinkies4thWall> BOOM
*alexxm hugs Bronysith
<Randomnerd> Damn you, Hitler!
<GilDash> pikorar: ... I'd be completely fine with that. ;)
<Lil_B> Bronysith "Red Baron"
<Caramel> BronyNation is essentially going to be a conglomerate of major brony sites that put emphasis on community projects and creations
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: It doesn't if you earn money for things you love doin'. For instance i love doing Jackle.
<Randomnerd> Y U so hard 2 kill?
<Caramel> so for example
<MicTheSpectator> **I mean music.
<supersora10> Supersora "Roxas the master"
<Caramel> if someone were to make a new pony flash game
<Caramel> they would post it on BronyNation
<pikorar> They should have gotten a guy dressed as hitler to be hitler.
<ponyremix> MicTheSpectator.. and you make money off of doing jackle
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hehehe, chrome pony, now haters will have to move to IE
<Caramel> it intends to be the end all Brony media outlet
<ponyremix> IM SO JELLY
<Yokupony> Hitler uses god mode
<Bronysith> Lil_B: theres 1000 of those
<Bronysith> Lil_B: add me im Bronysith
<Caramel> so, what are your thoughts on this?
<supersora10> Where? on DA?
<pikorar> Hitler just respawned.
<Meanwhile> Ikr.
<Randomnerd> Rest of planet goes FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<theSHHAS> i made a pony gif. this is my first try http://theshhas.deviantart.com/art/First-Try-gif-306144851
<ponyremix> MicTheSpectator.. best job ever....
<Sumica> 00,10lol the roof poping off.
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: You have.

<BlueInk> boom
<Ghosties> 04Wait
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: NO idea.
<Ghosties> 04Hold on
<SaxyPretender> 0,14how close would the integration be?
<Chrysalis> your face when i use IE by choice
<Meanwhile> Roof must go, his planet needs him.
<Yokupony> theSHHAS: That's good for a first try
<theSHHAS> yay!
*alexxm hugs Bronysith
<GilDash> Two guys, one garage...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I assume this would take a long time
<Ghosties> 04We can discuss who is in and who is not when we get to Slurry, since he also has it
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: Music's good.
<Eddmario> Aerosmith and Run DMC - Walk This Way
<Ghosties> 04Because BN is going to take a while
<pikorar> Clue: WWII edition: Hitler in a bunker with a cyanide pill.
<alexxm> GilDash ew
<ponyremix> MicTheSpectator.. you use FL dont you
<Ghosties> 04But for now, like Val has mentioned, it's to discuss where BN is going
<MicTheSpectator> EEEEVERYONE does.
<Caramel> .....
<GilDash> pikorar: Maybe we could do a Bronystate version of Clue! :)
<Caramel> Ty...
<Caramel> if you read the pastebin
<Ghosties> 04It's on your thing
<Ghosties> 04I read it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Where it's going is up to who's in the know.
<FlareChaser> ....hmmm..
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> developers for web do not count, they have to live with IE by choice
<supersora10> Eddmario
<Ghosties> 04And I read over Slurry's too
<Lil_B> Bronysith done
<Caramel> you'll see we combined Slurry's BN thing with mine
<cachi01> GilDash did it!
<ponyremix> MicTheSpectator.. lets see you, yoav, glaze, jackle...
<supersora10> wern't you kicked?
<Ghosties> 04But Slurry's BN comes later
<pikorar> GilDash: pikorar in the stream with a live bear strapped to a big stick.
<Ghosties> 04Unless you want to shift his to be the first thing that comes up
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Guys, relax.
<Yokupony> I don't understand American adverts ._.
<FlareChaser> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: so...whatcha doing on L4D2?
<GilDash> cachi01: Whoah, what? :D
<RustyMeat> I have no idea what happned
<MicTheSpectator> Jackle: Alright. Off of the computer. No more r34 for you. We need to get starting.
<Eddmario> It was Molestia, in the throne room, with a-I better not finish that sentance if I don't wanna get kicked.
*Luna is calm
<Pinkies4thWall> lol
<MicTheSpectator> mMmm. Mac and Cheese.
<MicTheSpectator> I mean.
<GilDash> pikorar: Who did you kill though? ;)
<MicTheSpectator> Goodbye.
<Alchemist> Yokupony: they are better than east european ads :D
<pikorar> Nittany in the stream with the banhammer.
<MicTheSpectator> I need to please.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<ponyremix> MicTheSpectator.. is it true that glaze is a woman... just wanting to confirm a rumor
<GilDash> pikorar: That sounds right. :D
<MicTheSpectator> *leave
<pikorar> I killed alexxm, GilDash. Just kiddin' I love alexxm.
<GilDash> pikorar: Shit! Canada is the one who get's banned! :O
<Caramel> well, there's no sense in dividing the topic into pieces
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> FlareChaser dunno i though there was going to be a match but no one else has launched l4d2
<Wrek> 05so we shouldnt post our thoughts?
<Caramel> we should just get it all out now
<Chrysalis> Bronysith how many we got?
<FlareChaser> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I MCOMING! D:
<Eddmario> ponyrimix: Go listen to the big smile project and you'll know
<supersora10> What are you talking about?
<alexxm> why can't brian blessed do this advery
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts MicTheSpectator
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: The rumor is in fact true. GLAZE IS IN FACT A 'MARE'.
<Chrysalis> CREDIT WIPEOUT
<SlurryMoon> Let's just discuss it now, since Val's already on that topic
<supersora10> L4D2 was released about 3-4 years ago!
*alexxm hugs pikorar
<ponyremix> ..........
<ScootaChicken> ponyremix: 1. Have you even listened to a single vocal track he's done 2. I've met him IRL>
<ponyremix> shocked
<HatsuneMikuFan> Does anypony want to play L4D2(Xbox)?
<cachi01> glaze is a mare?
*pikorar hugs alexxm with a live bear strapped to a stick.
<cachi01> then who sings rainbow factory?
<MicTheSpectator> Nittany_Discord: Thanks, but I don't have time to clean.
<Litwick> AIR DELIGHT LOOKS FUCKING GOOD
<Litwick> It's like an American Aero!
<Eddmario> So, which is his true name, "glaze" or "Wooden Toaster"?
<CeilingKirz> 8,6I find it amusing you all think MicTheSpectator isn't an impersonating troll
<ponyremix> how does she...... the voice..........
<supersora10> Wut
<Meanwhile> CeilingKirz: I do think that.
<cachi01> Eddmario: glaze
<supersora10> THATS NAWT TRUE!
<pikorar> That text color makes me want some pink lemonade...
<Irish_Pony> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d529qsd
<Bronysith> CeilingKirz: sup man u up for a l4d2 vs
<supersora10> DAT2 1MP0SS13BLE!
<Chrysalis> Sumica you streaming said new ep?
<Caramel> okay, first and foremost
<ScootaChicken> CeilingKirz: I think that.
<Caramel> where do you see Bronystate going?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MicTheSpectator: I haven't been sold that he is the real Mic from minute one.
<Eddmario> ponyremix the same way Tabitha St. Germain or Kathleen Barr does male voices
<Caramel> thoughts, put them here
<Caramel> now
<CeilingKirz> 8,6can't right now Bronysith
<Derpyty> mythbusters!:D
<Derpyty> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I mean CeilingKirz
<supersora10> Wub wub wub
<Bronysith> okay CeilingKirz
<MicTheSpectator> Nittany: I thinks this is getting old.
<BlazeAngel> Oooh...
<CeilingKirz> 8,6there's also the fact that I've kicked the guy before for trying to impersonate people
<ponyremix> i'm truely surprised...
<LordCelestia> 0,5Uhm
<pikorar> A slap to the face can mean jailtime for domestic violence.
<Sumica> 00,10new ep is like 8 hours from now
<BlazeAngel> Hey bronystate!
<Saturn> 08,01as far as i see it, we're looking to be a host for fandom-created brony content, yes?
<Vinyer> guess i'm running my battery down to 0 power
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Yes.
<pikorar> Hi BlazeAngel! I love you!
<Caramel> yes
<Sumica> 00,10I have no clue if I would even have the stream then
<MicTheSpectator> Look I don't need to prove anything. I can't. It's the internet.
<Saturn> 08,01and not just a host, but above that too
<MicTheSpectator> Leave it be.
<BlazeAngel> pikorar: O.O
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I see BronyState expanding a little, not exactly the center of the Brony-verse, but we have our place
<GilDash> pikorar: Depends on how hard you slap them. ;)
<LordCelestia> 0,5^
<Saturn> 08,01with critiques and advice from experieneced creators
<alexxm> hey BlazeAngel hows your day been
<Vinyer> it's possible i might gain access to an outlet in like half an hour but not sure yet
<supersora10> SMACK EM HAAAAARD
<theSHHAS> http://theshhas.deviantart.com/#/d5294o6
<MicTheSpectator> I'm really pissed at your superstition.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So Mic, I just spoke with you on Skype and you told me you were NOT on the Bronystate chat. Care to explain?
<BlazeAngel> alexxm: Fine.
<ponyremix> alright i'm leaving i'll see you guys later and your freaking awsome mic... peace
<Wrek> 05my thoughts on bronynation: a fantastic idea. and i support it fully. but it requiers long planning and no rushing whatsoever. i also dont want it to forget where it came from. id rather we slowly turn bronystate into bronynation rather than just one day flip the switch. giving us time to perfect the new elements as the yare ready. a perfect example is back when we discussed the art
<Wrek> 5speedpaints and lets plays. If we end up having to quit streaming shows and new episodes on brnoystate because our other elements gets to big. then we can switch that to another place to keep bronynation out of trouble. but we still link it when we stream and such. but thats a detail we should take when it arises.
<Om-away> Great after slap face
<GilDash> pikorar: Also depends on if they're asking for it. ;)
<ScootaChicken> Shits gone down.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Busted
<MicTheSpectator> ponyremix: Goodbye.
<pikorar> I wouldn't mind a slap from you GilDash.
<MicTheSpectator> I need to leave too.
*GilDash slaps pikorar.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sure you do~
<supersora10> Piko must be insane.
<hen3ry> eeyup
<ScootaChicken> MicTheSpectator: I think you should answer Scoot-Scootaloo's question first.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That was one thing I was wondering.
*alexxm slaps GilDash hows it feel
<pikorar> That was my face, GilDash! Ow! Fuck! That hurt!
<ponyremix> BYE EVERYPONY!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When BN comes into being, what happens to BS?
<ScootaChicken> I'm fairly sure all of us want to know the answer.
<supersora10> Told ya.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bye ponyremix
<alexxm> bye ponyremix
<pikorar> By ponyremix! Love you!
<supersora10> Sup.
<BlazeAngel> Slap.
<hen3ry> he left
<ponyremix> love you two piko
<supersora10> Bye
<cachi01> bye ponyremix
<BlazeAngel> Confir- confir-med.
<Saturn> 08,01i'd reckon we'd keep it running, but try and keep it as separate from BN as we can
<tehRequital|Drawing> Yes..
<GilDash> pikorar: Be more specific next time. :)
<RustyMeat> lol
<Saturn> 08,01to avoid potential legal issues
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think this was a topic during the last meeting.
<pikorar> Then you should be Hitler. He can't die.
<Irish_Pony> I miss Gamer_Luna :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Eddmario> Anypony here play Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition?
<GilDash> alexxm: I think I'm used to it. ;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But we'll need more people to run both sites.
*alexxm hugs GilDash
<Saturn> 08,01if BS gets a C&D, we wouldn't want that to bring down BN too
<cachi01> Eddmario: i so
<cachi01> i do*
<Caramel> to clarify
*GilDash hugs alexxm.
<Om> ...
<fluttercry> 05,15I want to see Bronynation happen. I'd love for us to become one of the top sites in the community. But I do not want to see Bronystate disappear.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and mic has left the building
<Chrysalis> Eddmario i believe most play the pc version
<Caramel> we fully recognize BN is something very far away
<GilDash> Om: Hello. Why're you hiding? ;)
<Caramel> in addition
*alexxm has a tower of beer cans in his romm
*alexxm has a tower of beer cans in his room
<Caramel> this is why we're making partnerships with other sites, like 20% cooler
<Om> GilDash: I wanted the cake in the kitchen.
<pikorar> Knowing you, GilDash, I thought there would only be one kind of place you'd slap a person.
<Caramel> because they will be a part of our BN idea
<DerpSurge> GilDash loves the Rarity emoticon ;)
<Saturn> 08,01well, what kind of timescale are we talking about here?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14again, how close would the integration be? would all the sites be merging into one or would we all carry a certain banner?
<pikorar> Duh!
<Eddmario> So, have you guys seen that Lyra plushie that's going around the webs?
<Wrek> 05short version: I see bronystate flower into BN in time with added features and such. stripping away the potential legal issues to a separate place.
<pikorar> It's Rarity! ANd it's the winky face!
<RustyMeat> eeyup
<GilDash> pikorar: I'm teasing you, silly filly. ;)
<alexxm> Eddmario sadly yes
<HatsuneMikuFan> Eddmario: -_-
<Irish_Pony> ded
<GilDash> DerpSurge: It's kind of a requirement. :D
<Eddmario> Would make for a pretty cool beer cozy
<cachi01> Eddmario: yeah :l
<Rainbowloyalty> Yes! Mythbusters!
<Caramel> as for timescale, it would be small steps at a time
<BlazeAngel> "Weve exposed the creamy center" Reminds me of ghostbusters. :3
<Caramel> probably a year or more
<Chrysalis> 3 more slots for l4d2 versus
<RAWRity> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-put-on-your-brave-face.jpg
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Bronystate has been and should always be for the brony community. We aren't MEANT to be the all-in-one mightier-than-though place, we are meant to be what we can be while still having a connection to both the artists and the viewers. Bronystate has done an okay job with that, but BronyNation is meant to take it to a higher level. The youtube playlists and the Artist Spotlight are the
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11beginings of this concept, and we can grow on it until BronyState fully transforms into a major Brony Community icon.
<Saturn> 08,01because i remember us talkin gbaout this near 6 months ago, and so far as i can see, there's been absoltuely no progress on it, apart from some abstract discussions with other sites
<pikorar> Knowing my luck I would be just a random hobo who had his house 2 feet away from that.
<BlazeAngel> XD
<Randomnerd> What.
<GilDash> pikorar: Doubtful. I'd take you in before that. :)
<Randomnerd> Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeg
<Irish_Pony> WHA?!
<Eddmario> I'm pretty sure the flames would kill anyone
<Lil_B> Still have 3 slots for the L4D2 versus... somebody interrested?
<Chrysalis> im a programmer not a web writer
<Irish_Pony> BULLSHIT!
<Saturn> 08,01is there any kind of timetable set for milestones, both conceptial and practical, so far?
<pikorar> Yes, because every hobo has a plane ticket to the United Kingdom.
<BlazeAngel> Lil_B: PC, right?
<hen3ry> its because the door blew off, releasing the pressure
<FlareChaser|L4D2> anypony for L4D2? 3 slots left! PLAY WITH FLARE!
<FlareChaser|L4D2> ;3
<Lil_B> BlazeAngel yes

<BlazeAngel> Lil_B: Maybe later. :P
<pikorar> Oh... The credits...
<alexxm> can we kill hitler now
<Randomnerd> If they collapsed the bunker...
<Lil_B> BlazeAngel ok
<Eddmario> Flarechaser, are you one of the guys who makes TF2 VSH Bosses?
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11The difference between us and other icons, though, is that we keep a connection to the community AS A WHOLE. We con't discriminate, we don't put ourselves above them, we don't let personal ideas and affections get in the way, we don't put them down because we don't agree on an opinion. We treat them equally.
<Om> Everything needs more explosives
<FlareChaser|L4D2> Eddmario: ....maybe
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> then whats wrong with your little pony mind ?
<RAWRity> man, they're so happy about Hitler surviving
<pikorar> Like the stream.
<hen3ry> no. "You COULD have survived" not "WOULD have."
<Shamroc> Eddmario: nope he never even played a vsh game untill he joined me a few days ago
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We need to always do that.
<GilDash> Om: I can find you some explosives. :)
<alexxm> you are
<Caramel> milestones aren't set in stone simply because we're seeing who's on board with this
<Om> GilDash: Okay.
<pikorar> Bronystate is the best place to be watching Myth Busters.
<Randomnerd> More to the point, Hitler would have probably been deafened.
<Meanwhile> Dat expertise.
<FlareChaser|L4D2> Shamroc: I played a VSH game WAAAAY before I joined you :P
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11As far as I know, the Artist Spotlight and the Youtube Playlists are the first step towards BronyNation. Slowly intigrate them to be a norm for bronystate, along with the queue stremers.
<Shamroc> FlareChaser|L4D2: LIES
<Caramel> if the team is good with it, then we're going to make them
<BlazeAngel> pikorar: And how.
<Caramel> we have a skype group for BronyNation
<TheRainbowDash> pikorar: It is the best place to watch anything.
<ZombieBrony> Oh Hai Bronystate
<Saturn> 08,01shouldn't that in itself be a milestone/deadline, val?
<Insert_cupc4ke> they are looking at a male bag
<Caramel> that's where all the planning will be done
<TheRainbowDash> Hello ZombieBrony!
<Meanwhile> Allo ZombieBrony.
<FlareChaser|L4D2> Shamroc: Seriously!
<pikorar> Hitler's voice tops at 200 decibals. I think his ears can stand an explosion...
<Princess_Molestia> hi
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi ZombieBrony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Need 3 more for a VS match on L4D2 anyone wants to play ?
<Caramel> that's why it's on the team meeting topic

<alexxm> hey ZombieBrony hows your day been

<Chrysalis> come on guys
<Caramel> that's why I want everyone's thoughts now
<Chrysalis> 2 SLOTS FOR L4D2
<FlareChaser|L4D2> spam invite CeilingKirz :3
<Om> Argon gas
<Shamroc> FlareChaser|L4D2: hes busy dude
<alexxm> Princess_Molestia are you ready yet
<Saturn> 08,01fair enough, so long as it doesn't stagnate as a project
<Chrysalis> ppsssst: kirz, you want to join us
<FlareChaser|L4D2> Shamroc: Ah, okay.
<Princess_Molestia> Oh, ok
<pikorar> Bigger guns makes everything funner... As long as the person with the gun doesn't want you dead.
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: give me a minute.
<Chrysalis> psst. Nittany_Discord so do you
<SaxyPretender> 0,14for me, it depends on how closely the potential sites are integrated
<FlareChaser|L4D2> ...Spam invite shamroc. :3
<Randomnerd> Why must Kari Byron be married, whyyyy
<Shamroc> FlareChaser|L4D2: i already said no
<Randomnerd> Derpy brought them letters!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile okay
<Caramel> that's why I'm prodding us now, because Luna and I are sick of it not going anywhere
<Insert_cupc4ke> so many male
<Wrek> 05@silver and in time the sections will be perfected. I think you and me have simillar ideas on how this "should" be
<alexxm> Randomnerd to ruin your dreams
<Caramel> think of it this way Saxy:
<pikorar> I like being surrounded by male... Mmmmm.
<FlareChaser|L4D2> Alright, you said no im okay with that..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: Wut?
<Randomnerd> alexxm: lol
<FlareChaser|L4D2> anyone for L4D2? we have 2 slots open :3
<Caramel> BN is a hub site, which connects and links to all the participants of BN
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if everyone gets to do their own thing, but carry a common banner, I'm cool with that
<FlareChaser|L4D2> I think
<SlurryMoon> I think we should really get planning going. We have the idea, let's get the ball at least moving somewhat. Whoever wants to help with this should be in that group and help out with ideas and plans, etc. no?
<Chrysalis> want to join us for som l4d2
<MahBoi777> pikorar: oh myyyyyy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm busy.
<Chrysalis> you know you want to
<Chrysalis> awwww
<Om> pikorar: I was wondering when someone would say that.
<Caramel> that's exactly what we intend slurry'
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> One slot open for L4D2, who wants in ?
<pikorar> I can get pretty frisky, can't I, MahBoi777?
<MahBoi777> lol

<GilDash> MahBoi777: Oh, hello. ;)
<Princess_Molestia> Hello pikorar.
<Caramel> alright, are there any opposed to BN?
<Caramel> any concerns?
<pikorar> You knew that it was going to be either me or GilDash to say that, Om.
<Eddmario> Man, these guys have one of the best jobs
<Littleguy> http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/311/691/8be.jpg I assume most of you'd like this.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cupcakes don't like your parties anymore. Make friends.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm still wary of this
<Wrek> 05i have mentioned my concerts and thoughts.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Slurry: I repeat, that's what the Youtube Playlists and artist spotlight things are for.
<BlazeAngel> *perks up* Did somebody say DOYLE?
<alexxm> Princess_Molestia are you ready yet
<Airpuff> Mythbuster gon bust.
<|Discord|> SO they can afford all that other shit BUT they can't get a new test dummy?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14from my personal experience, too much merging kills communities
<MahBoi777> hello GilDash, how are you?
<SlurryMoon> nope, with enough planning, it should work. We need to get together and plan plan plan.
<Om> pikorar: I dind't know who. Its not like I keep track of your intrests. Nor do I care to
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Combine them with the queue streaming, and we have the beginings of BronyNation.
<pikorar> If bronystate goes down I'm going to be forced to actually do stuff with my life. :(
<Princess_Molestia> I know who you are.
<Chrysalis> so this explosion, is purely gratuitus boom
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BN is a good idea. We'll just need to prepare to hire more people down the line.
<Ghosties> 04First off, we're not even sure what Bronynation will become
<Eddmario> only about 3 weeks til the video we've all been waiting for
<BlazeAngel> pikorar: Same, but ill die before that.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14too much change, too many new people conflicting with the regulars, people leave
<alexxm> who am i Princess_Molestia
<Randomnerd> Ew ew ew
<Airpuff> pikorar: i know.. sounds terrible:(
<Ghosties> 04We're not sure if it's going to be a hub site or a merging
<RustyMeat> I found the Lyra if anyone is interrested http://www.thedealersden.com/auction_details.php?auction_id=110031&parent_id=&option=agree_adult
<pikorar> I can tell you're just as frisky as us, Om. You just need a little time and love.
<Ghosties> 04We don't know
<BlazeAngel> CINEMON CHALLENGE?
<MahBoi777> pikorar: EGAD
*GilDash snuggles MahBoi777.
<Shamroc> RustyMeat...dude drop the idea
<Kyiko> oh god
<Irish_Pony> Oh Princess_Molestia is here Im just gonna walk away.....*walks away*
<Om> No comment.
<Shizuka> 13too bad webrings were lame in the 1990s
<BlazeAngel> MEDIC
<GabeMoist> oh dear
<Sumica> 00,10Sure seems to be alot of outsidelinking going on.
<Litwick> It works idiot.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if it's a hub site like Val's saying, where we're connected, but still functionally seperate, I can jive with that
<CeilingKirz> RustyMeat, do not link that
<Randomnerd> Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<GilDash> I've done cinnamon without a problem. :)
<Irish_Pony> XD
<BlazeAngel> "A spoon full of cinemon makes the medicine go down" Damn fucking kids songs.
<Ghosties> 04But as for us, for BronyState's team, I've talked it over with a few TLs and we thought about possibly just passing along work to the team members for those that want to be involved in BronyNation but would rather work on it then just plan for it
<RustyMeat> :o
<pikorar> She needs an exorcist!
<SlurryMoon> BN won't happen unless we make it happen. What is it? We dont' know. that's why we need to get everyone one board and figure out what it will become. it won't just pop out of thin air. If you don't like it now, that's because it isn't anything yet. You have a voice. You can fix problems. You can help it become something that will work for everyone.
<MahBoi777> lol
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Yokupony> fus ro dah!
<Eddmario> Cinnimon challange? Try the Kool Aid challange.
<hen3ry> dat exhale
<Bronysith> CeilingKirz: you said ur up for the parade right?
<Randomnerd> Ow ow ow
<Irish_Pony> XD
<alexxm> whats that Eddmario
<Eddmario> You down 5 spoonfulls of pure kool aid powder
<Shamroc> Bronysith: he said nope..
<pikorar> I can actually bypass my gag reflex... Heh, so many innuendos can come from me saying that.
<Om> GilDash: You must lack a gag reflexs
<Airpuff> I've done that once. never again xDD
<Caramel> alright, so to conclude:
<Bronysith> Shamroc: are you?
<GilDash> Om: Not really. I just focused.
<Ghosties> 04And like Slurry said, it really feels like there's a split and we're going to make decisions soon
<Randomnerd> O_O
<Shamroc> Bronysith: i have no camra to
<Irish_Pony> Oh god :S
<MahBoi777> Airpuff: Lol
<Caramel> we'll be adding the teamleaders and anyone who wants to participate with BN to the BN group
<BlazeAngel> No. :3
<Bronysith> Shamroc: okay then
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Caramel> is there ANYONE opposed to this idea?
<Eddmario> Eeeeeeeeeeeeew
<Litwick> that or you're a fucking psycho GilDash
<Irish_Pony> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Om> GilDash: Sure sure.
<Airpuff> MahBoi777: you ... just send out a cloud of .... yeah
<Ghosties> 04Unless they want to just work and not be involved in the group
<Irish_Pony> eeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww
<Princess_Molestia> Sith, are you ready?
<GilDash> Litwick, Om: Nah. You just need to focus and chew like crazy.
<Insert_cupc4ke> im sure you could condition yourself to do it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Put me down for opposed until there's a better semblance of a structure
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We just don't need to spread ourselves thing.
<Randomnerd> But why?!
<BlazeAngel> Like a baws so far.
<Insert_cupc4ke> start off with a little
<Om> GilDash: You are still insane.
<Meanwhile> Needs to be about 20% something-er
<Ghosties> 04I must confess, this isn't something that can be just talked about, since there are members on the team that are still opposed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*thin
<GilDash> Om: See Tori is doing fine too. :)
<Irish_Pony> cmon lad!
<pikorar> When you want to bypass your gag reflex just don't think that you can't swallow it. Don't turn that into an innuendo... Or if you do don't voice it against me.
<Sumica> 00,10like a baws
<MahBoi777> ^
<Om> GilDash: And yet, you are still insane
<Ghosties> 04How would you address that, Val?
<BlazeAngel> HE DID IT.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11May I say something about this?
<Bronysith> Sumica: LIKE A BOSS
<Insert_cupc4ke> bawsliek
<GilDash> pikorar: Hey, I've got great experience with my gag reflex. ;)
<Kyiko> YYYEEAAAAAHH
<Caramel> Saxy: would you be opposed to joining the group so that you can help form what structure you wish?
<Insert_cupc4ke> ima try it
<MahBoi777> O_o
<GilDash> Om: I never said anything about that. :D
*Airpuff gives GilDash a spoon of Cinamon
<Caramel> as for spreading ourselves too thin
<CCCP> Is this the cinnamon challenge????????????
<Randomnerd> He starts coughing up blood
<Caramel> this is why we're joining with other sites
<DerpSurge> LIKE A BAWS
<Caramel> Bronystate is Bronystate
<pikorar> Grow a mustache. It will make you badass at the cinnamon challenge.
<Om> GilDash: Wont change my opinions
<pikorar> I meant beard.
<Caramel> BronyNation is something else
*GilDash eats Airpuff's spoonful of cinnamon.
<CCCP> hello?
<pikorar> Grow a beard.
<SlurryMoon> That's why we need discussions, Saxy. If some of us come up with an idea you don't like, you can help fix it to where it will work. If you're opposed, I implore you to join the group and help out.
<Caramel> regardless of what happens to BronyNation
<alexxm> how come something so simple is so dangerous
<Airpuff> GilDash: 6_9
<MahBoi777> hello CCCP
<DerpSurge> GilDash: drunk gagging? :D
<pikorar> Hi CCCP! Love you!
<Caramel> we are still bronystate

<GilDash> Princess_Molestia: Your higness. ;)
<CCCP> hi Ponies47 and DerpSurge
<GilDash> Airpuff: Nah, I'm good. :)
<Irish_Pony> Dat sex god
<hen3ry> it absorbs water. First your free saliva, then it goes after the fluids inside the cells of your cheeks and gums.
<Acleps> alexxm: It's been fine
<MahBoi777> lol
<BlazeAngel> One time, I was on a plane, and I still had connection to this website. I was like. :O :) :O :)
<CCCP> alexxm: its been good, you?
<Princess_Molestia> ;)
<Airpuff> GilDash: ... hax! xD
<pikorar> Because alexxm, cinnamon is like an allergen when you take a full spoonfull. Your body just treats it like a toxin or a poison.
<CeilingKirz> there's still no clear line of whether bronystate will continue as it is, or whether it will merge into the bronynation site, or grow into the bronynation site
<Ghosties> 04Silver?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14my biggest concern is that we don't lose our audience for the sake of chasing of what might be a pipe dream (I think that's the right term)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dat Totally random team
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm happy with being our own niche
<GilDash> pikorar: Not if you handle it right. ;)
<Ghosties> 04Well, with what Saxy is saying
<Caramel> as I said, Bronystate stays the same
<MahBoi777> >.>
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Ghosties> 04It seems most of the newer members are against while the older members are for
<HatsuneMikuFan> Can i post a video during the commercial?
<pikorar> Eric Hanson? I know that name.
<Sumica> 00,10a part of the whole
<Caramel> nothing changes to Bronystate when we affiliate with BN
<DerpSurge> He likes guro :D
<CCCP> boom!
<BlazeAngel> BOOM
<Ghosties> 04We don't know that, Val
<Ghosties> 04We don't know how BN is gonna work out
<SlurryMoon> See *affiliate* I don't think BS is going anywhere.
<Ghosties> 04The only thing we've really done is just discuss the possibility of "what could be"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Seems BN needs more planning.
<alexxm> i'm good CCP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A lot more.
<SlurryMoon> yes
<SlurryMoon> yes
<Wrek> 05SaxyPretender: good. cause since BS inst compromised by BN, that shouldnt be a problem
<SlurryMoon> exactly
<Wrek> 05isnt*
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi CCCP
<cachi01> lol i was reading the lyra lushie comments on know ur meme and found this http://www.pajamasandcoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/what_the_fuck_is_this_shit_dr_seus.jpg
<Caramel> Ty, we've ALWAYS said that BS would be its own thing
<Ponies47> You know I've bern thinking this over and I think I'm gonna give up trying to make my bro a brony. He has listened to 3 episodes, Winter Wrap Up, and Smile Smile Smile, He didn't like it :'( (Or did he)
<Randomnerd> Hey CCCP
<Ghosties> 04And this is why things have stagnated, because others on the team are against and I'd like everyone to move forward with us
<SlurryMoon> that's why we need everyone to help out and make it work
<CCCP> hi HatsuneMikuFan :D
<Randomnerd> Ow.
<pikorar> Next time on mythbusters: Are atomic bombs as fun to blow up as the media says? *Atomic exlposion*... Yes. Yes they are.
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah if BN doesn't affect BS then I'm perfectly fine with it
<Caramel> never once have we even remotely discussed the possibility of evolving it like that
<Acleps> What season is this?
<Randomnerd> Ow ow ow.
<Ghosties> 04But that's not what we talked about with the others for BN
<Airpuff> Adam is getting hurt all the time xD
<MysticLugia> 12!pokemon
<Ghosties> 04I was there for the opening discussion
<ScriptBot> MysticLugia, you are a 10Luxio.
<Irish_Pony> oooooooowwwwwwww
<BlazeAngel> XD
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: just denial lol
<MysticLugia> 12!eonget
<RustyMeat> dude
<ScriptBot> 4MysticLugia just got a female 8Jolteon
<Ghosties> 04There were talks of what of; a hub site? Merging?
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Brony Nation is, in the end, us being a showcase for the rest of the hard working Brony community. We show off the talents of people who have much to offer and give them a place where they can become known and come into the spotlight. People who view BronyNation learn of what artists, musicians, video makers and whatnot that they like and branch off to them. And since we are so open
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11and friendly with what we promote, there is no discrimination or favoritism to push the community away from using BronyNation.
<CCCP> hi Randomnerd
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Caramel> then you and I must have been in two completely different conversations
<Vinyer> !blame
*ScriptBot blames Skylands.
<Kammerjunk> Look at these people, amazing how sheep'll show up for the slaughter.
<BlazeAngel> *snap* *Booooooooooooooom*
<MahBoi777> hey Randomnerd
<pikorar> With adam's hairstyles throughout the years he was always asking for pain.
<alexxm> i'm good CCCP my dads girlfriend said she might watch an episode of mlp
<Randomnerd> Ohai MahBoi777
<pikorar> I like pleasure...
<Ghosties> 04Nothing was set in stone for how BronyNation would be represented
<Kammerjunk> No one condemning, you lined up like lemmings, you lead to the water.
<Om> Mmmm, veiwing pleasure.
<MahBoi777> O_o
<CCCP> alexxm: thats great! :D :D
<Randomnerd> alexxm: awesome
<Insert_cupc4ke> alexxm you are assimilating your entire family at this rate
<HatsuneMikuFan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS-KVpZ9mrQ
<pikorar> Hah! Om! I knew you could get frisky.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not for or against BN. It just needs planning because it appears that there isn't any. It's just an idea.
<Eddmario> I wonder if there was a MLP question in that mail bag...
<Litwick> Dead Space
<Acleps> Wait.... This is live TV?
<Om> pikorar: No comment.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11...
<Ran> 2!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ran, you are a 7Phione.
<Ran> 2!eonget
<ScriptBot> 4Ran just got a shiny female 8Jolteon
<Luna> Listen to me
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: I thought Smile Smile Smile was gonna get him. Well he really didn't listen to it. Maybe I should make him listen to it agian.
<Ran> 2<3
<MahBoi777> oh my
<Luna> BN will happen
<SlurryMoon> Nothing is set in stone. So far we have, what? a name? a vague idea? We need everyone to get together and help discuss, change, manage, etc. It's so important
<EccoCode> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> EccoCode, you are a 6Zoroark.
<Luna> with or without us
<Eddmario> Isn't Prometheus part of the Alien seies?
<EccoCode> ^^
<Eddmario> *series
<Luna> either we hop on the bandwagon now
<pikorar> MMmm... Frisky Om.
<SilverSonic> whee playing Kirby music live!
<CeilingKirz> the problem how I see it is, there has been very little planning for BN because nobody will move forward unless everyone is on board, but everyone's not going to come aboard unless they see that there is some sort of plan
<GilDash> Om: I've got some viewing pleasure for you right here. ;)
<Ghosties> 04Luna's right
<alexxm> Eddmario i think so
<Randomnerd> Eddmario: Sort of?
<Ghosties> 04Either you're for this or you're not
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11WHAT FUCKING PART OF "YOUTUBE PLAYLIST AND ARTIST SPOTLIGHT ARN'T YOU FUCKING GETTING?
<Alchemist> the minute I saw the Prometheus trailer I lost my hope of it being a a decent movie.
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: Lesson Zero and Party of one alwasy helps lol
<Gamer_Luna> I'm back! :)
<MahBoi777> dang typo
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11I've said it at least three times.
<alexxm> how come Alchemist
<Eddmario> Am I the only one who wants to see Battleship?
<fluttercry> 05,15Wait, you guys have seen That Guy with the Glasses right? They all have their own sites, but they all are tied under the That Guy banner.
<MahBoi777> hello Gamer_Luna
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm fine with BN then.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Welcome back Gamer_Luna
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not against it.
<Om> e_e I belive a retreat is in order.
<pyrocatboy> yes
<pikorar> I would pay to see it, GilDash! Just write on this check how many millions of dollars you want.
<Alchemist> alexxm: it just seemed too generic.
<alexxm> hey Gamer_Luna hows your day been
<Wrek> 05so who is against and why?
<Wrek> 05so far i havent seen anyone
<MahBoi777> Om: run run run lol
<Nick> o.o
<CCCP> hi Gamer_Luna
<Nick> nice ecco!
<Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a 6Geodude.
<SilverSonic> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> SilverSonic, you are a 4Blaziken.
<Nick> .....................................
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka was during the last meeting.
<GilDash> Gamer_Luna: Holla! :)
<pikorar> You know what's weird?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's the only person I know.
<Wrek> 05why?
<Alchemist> alexxm: I havent seen it yet, so it might still redeem itself, but im skeptical
<Shizuka> 13i'll go with it if we have a plan
<Gamer_Luna> alexxm: I just woke up :$
<CeilingKirz> same
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Thank you, Fluttercry
<GilDash> pikorar: I don't need any. I'll give you a private show. ;)
<alexxm> Alchemist you only saw a minute out of what at least 90 minutes give it a chance
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A plan and good communication.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Please watch your tone SirSilverscreen
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Those where 2 of the episodes he listened to. He really didn't WATCH them he just LISTEND. And he said that counts as watching. I think I'm gonna need some tape. :3
<pikorar> We call pure elemental iron steel, but we call iron alloys iron... WTF SCIENCE!?
<Ghosties> 04We need to know what BronyNation is primarily for, and I hope we're not forgetting: It's a way to give things back to the fan...to make it a place where the fan is the most important aspect of the site
<MahBoi777> SCIENCE
<Wrek> 05ok so if people got together, and worked up a bit more defined outline to what BN is
<Acleps> pikorar: I don't get it....
<Saturn> 08,01i'm for it, but i think that as it stands, it's a load of hot air with no plan of action. the ball need to start rolling.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if it's a hub site/overall banner, then I'd be okay with it
<Wrek> 05and then presented it
<Randomnerd> Hunh?
<Shizuka> 13but there has to be some kind of plan or else we're throwing effort at something that might not amount to anything
<pikorar> Hi Acleps! I love you!
<Wrek> 05we can have anotehr revision?
<Alchemist> elemental iron is iron.
<Ghosties> 04So all of us coming together for BronyNation is to make it for the fan, to give the fandom back to the fan primarily
<pikorar> But I'll explain, Acleps.
<bicyclerepairman> steel is an alloy
*alexxm hugs pikorar
<Ghosties> 04So with that said
<Shizuka> 13yeah a hub with banner could work, like a "part of the BronyNation network" kind of thing
<Caramel> honestly that's how I always envisioned it
<Ghosties> 04It looks like we're gonna be doing another meeting with the rest of the people involved with BronyNation
<GilDash> Acleps: Holla! :)
<Randomnerd> Oh, no... Deadliest Catch is back.
<Wrek> 05did no one hear me?
<Ghosties> 04It could very well be a hub...who knows
*GilDash hugs Acleps.
<RyunosukeKnT> people need to learn science before using sciency terms :)
<Gamer_Luna> So,what are we watching? :)
<Acleps> GilDash: Hey! :)
*Irish_Pony misses Gamer_Luna :'(
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bye everypony
<RyunosukeKnT> experts
<Caramel> yeah wrek, I think that's a good idea
<alexxm> hey Acleps what have you been up to
<Randomnerd> Gamer_Luna: Mythbusters
<Ponies47> Bye bye HatsuneMikuFan :)
<fluttercry> 05,15Exactly like I said TGWTG is a good model for that.
<MahBoi777> Gamer_Luna: Mythbustahs
<Ghosties> 04That's what the discussion with the other sites involved with BronyNation would be for
*Nittany_Discord 11,01applies water to RyunosukeKnT
<Ghosties> 04To discuss the next step
<Caramel> the admins and TL's will meet with people involved with BN
<alexxm> Irish_Pony Gamer_Lunas back
<Irish_Pony> Oh wait... Gamer_Luna is here?!
<Acleps> alexxm: Nothing special...
<Caramel> we'll draw something out
<Caramel> and then present it to you all
<Om> Cinnimon breathing dragon!
<Caramel> is that good?
<MahBoi777> yesh
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: Irish! :)
*Luna 07,01is getting all the pings
<CCCP> bye HatsuneMikuFan
<SaxyPretender> 0,14good enough for me
<Wrek> 05it will give those that are agaisnt sometihng to work with
<Ghosties> 04I'm fine and dandy with that, it seems that's our next step anyways
<alexxm> hey Luna hows your day been
*Nittany_Discord 11,01likes normal Luna
<MahBoi777> ohai Luna
<SlurryMoon> I think we're asking the wrong question. Rather, why are we even asking a question? It's not "Who is opposed and why?" It should be "Further discussion is needed. Please help plan, get the ball rolling, and get the idea cemented. Currently we have nothing, so no one can say they are opposed or not. We just need a way of thinking this through.'
*RyunosukeKnT randomly pings Luna
<Ponies47> Luna: Ping :P
<Vinyer> lol
<Dark_Horst> suddenly beard
<pikorar> When iron is refined and all of the impurities are removed we call it steel, but it's really pure elemental iron. But when you have an iron alloy, with all the impurities still in it, you call it iron... How does that make sense?
<CCCP> hi Luna
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Luna and brushes her mane
<Randomnerd> Yes, what is it?
<Irish_Pony> You all better not mention what i was like this morning to Gamer_Luna or i swear to god....
<Ghosties> 04That's what the talk will be for, Slurry
<Caramel> okay, so then we're agreed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good thought.
*Ran 2rolls Nick down a hill
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm for it.
<Caramel> good, now we can move on
<Acleps> pikorar: So steel = Pure Fe?
*Vinyer pets ran
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11"Please help plan, get the ball rolling, and get the idea cemented."
<Ran> 2:3
<Vinyer> lol
<hen3ry> steel is an alloy
<pikorar> Yes, Acleps. And iron = Fe alloy.
<Caramel> alright, resource management
<hen3ry> Fe + C + a few other things
<Alchemist> pikorar: there is no such thing as 100% pure. Steel still contains carbon.
<Caramel> We've graced this topic already, but I'd like to reiterate. If you're feeling as if your talents aren't being utilized. Speak up. Communication, blah blah blah. If you guys aren't willing to speak up, we'll never run efficiently.
<GilDash> Acleps: No... pikorar is being silly...
<Dark_Horst> pikorar: becasue iron was there first. and when we learned to make a by far more pure form, we needed another word to differ it from the cheaper iron
<Irish_Pony> but... Gamer_Luna <3
<Om> GilDash: Science is not silly!
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Am I just being ignored? WE have a plan to start it, we have an idea, and we know how to execute it for the time being until the next meeting.
<Acleps> pikorar; GilDash: I don't know what to believe now... :S
<Wrek> 05that made no sense. are you asking us to present out talents?
*Luna 07,01murrs softly
<Randomnerd> Woooooooooooooooooona
<pikorar> I know, Dark_Horst, but they should just realize that it's an iron alloy.
<MahBoi777> Science is science
<Caramel> no
<Ghosties> 04Because we can't just jump forward, Silver
<GilDash> Om: I didn't say it was. I said pikorar was.
*alexxm hugs Luna
<Caramel> we're asking you to tell us if you feel you aren't beind used properly
<CCCP> science is everything*
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: <3 I missed you :)
<Ghosties> 04If we don't look where we're going we're going to hit a wall
<Om> GilDash: Oh, thats fine then.
<Alchemist> By that logic its silly to call roasted bread a toast and not bread...
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: I missed you <3
<Magical_pablez94> and now... i'm finally back!
<MahBoi777> TOAST
<Caramel> since people may not want to come forward this publicly
<alexxm> my little mythbusters: explosins are magic
<Caramel> I'll leave it at this:
<CCCP> all toasters toast toast
<Magical_pablez94> alexxm: :D
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11I'm not saying we jump forward, I'm saying that we already have an idea to start with and that we already have a place to start a discussion on how to move forward.
<Caramel> The admins are in charge of organizing everything. If you don't like how the organization is going, TELL US
<MahBoi777> CCCP: O U
<Caramel> and we'll do something about it
<CCCP> :33
<Caramel> okay, good, moving on
<Eddmario> I wonder when the next chapter of "Myth Buckers" will come out...
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11We have a stepping stone to start with.
*alexxm nuzzles Magical_pablez94
<Airpuff> poof o.o
<Luna> we already worked on BN.. BS was a roadmap to eventually BN
<Caramel> Terms of Service. Yes or No? If we're okay with this idea, then we'll go forward with it. I'll assemble a group and whatnot. Any concerns about it?
<Gamer_Luna> Kisses Irish_Pony so,how was your morning? :)
<CCCP> Eddmario: me too
<NARF> acetylene
<RyunosukeKnT> JESUS
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: I dare not say...:S
<Randomnerd> Hotter than giant robots.
<Luna> I actually would like to see some responses on resource management
<Wrek> 05what would our ToS contain and what would its purpose be?
<pikorar> Le confirmation.
<Sumica> 00,10we are seting up a ToS?
<LordCelestia> 0,5^?
<Om> Irish_Pony: Hey, you found another thing. Good job.
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: Telll me,please? :(
*SilverSonic tackles someone random
<Caramel> explanation of what BS is, and that they agree that we aren't responsible for them being too young to see what we stream
