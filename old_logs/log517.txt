<Everlasting_Joy> Dollar bush <3.
<Crimson-Dragon> Nom
<Spy> is that bear grylls on livestream????
<Sundaysmile> yes
<Lil_B> Malavolent that often means that something is in this water that prevents other animel or microorganisms to life in there (poison or too much salt) so you shouldn't drink it as well
<MaidSurge> Spy: yep!
<CK|Catnap> Does it say anything about how parts of the show are bullshitted in order to make the show look more dramatic? :P
<prince-dari> Bear Grylls and the crew receive support when they are in potentially life threatening situations, as required by health and safety regulations. On some occasions, situations are presented to Bear so he can demonstrate survival techniques. Professional advice should always be sought before entering any dangerous environment."
<Spy> lol
<omnipony> well it's no coconut but its good enough
<Light_Latias> 12back

<Angel_Espeon> 13it happened the day you became a pancake :D
<Spy> but.....i wanted to chat about ponies...not bear grylls :'(
<Sylandest1> Panda: hehe, too slow on the draw there :D
<prince-dari> And he makes a raft to cross it
<Crimson-Dragon> Isnt most of wresteling fake?
<Light_Latias> 12I stepped outside for a moment
<prince-dari> And has to deal with crocodiles on the way across
<Chimera> I de-flatted myself
<Chimera> numbnuts
<Panda> Sylandest1: there is a first time for anything huh?
<Light_Latias> 12and my leg started melting
<Chimera> also yeah
<prince-dari> They might have fixed it so he has to cross that river
<Angel_Espeon> 13YOU'RE STILL A PANCAKE TO MEEE
<prince-dari> But the way he does it is real
<Chimera> f*** outside
<RaveBrony> Yeah, its not like they give him a raft :D

*Chimera runs
<Chimera> LOL
*Light_Latias hides
<Chimera> xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13also LOL at your hot weather
<Crimson-Dragon> So its semi legit?
<prince-dari> So if you're saying that what he does isn't real, that's shut idiotic
<Angel_Espeon> 13so just because I can
<prince-dari> Plain and simple.
<GilDash> Sylandest: Ninjazz was just on? :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13!weather Scarborough, UK

<Angel_Espeon> 13;D
<Chimera> evil england
<alexxm> Crimson-Dragon its more like the matches are predetimened but the moves can hurt or injure if they're done wrong
<Angel_Espeon> 13u jelly
<prince-dari> He has real knowledge, which he demonstrates to us.
<Light_Latias> 12;-;
<Panda> GilDash: yeah he just left :(
<Chimera> very
<CK|Catnap> I didn't say EVERYTHING isn't real.
<Sylandest1> GilDash: he just left for the day :( I didnt get to say goodbye either
<Light_Latias> 12DO WANT
<Chimera> take me with you
<Om> GilDash: And he wont be on for a while. He is on a plane
<Chimera> ;w;
<Spy> what is he doing?
<CK|Catnap> I said that parts of the show are faked.
<Light_Latias> 12I'll trade!
<Angel_Espeon> 13Sure but you gotta get yourself over here yourself :3c
<Chimera> xD
<GilDash> Om: A plane? A plane to where?
<derpy_pony> all this is filmed in a studio
<Petrified_Discord> The Sand-bushmen walk single-file to hide their numbers
<prince-dari> Nothing is 'faked'
<RaveBrony> O.o
*Light_Latias steals 63 degree F weather
<Sylandest1> GilDash: he's going to the states for a time
<Om> GilDash: See reletives here in the states
<Angel_Espeon> 13:<
<Lil_B> GilDash Ninjazz just went off, hes a way for some time now, but trys to come online when he can
<Panda> Om: wait what
<prince-dari> As I said, they might set it up so he has to encounter a certain obstacle.
<prince-dari> But the way he deals with it is real.
<derpy_pony> no edible bugs in the states
<prince-dari> Not fake.
<Spy> this is real, my uncle knows this guy
<Om> Panda: What?
<RyunosukeKnT> and these blaster marks, too accurate for sand-bushmen, only imperial troopers are so accurate :)
<Chimera> I wish there was a way to like
<Chimera> displace the heat
<GilDash> So, Ninjazz is going to the states. Fair does.
<Sundaysmile> earthworms are edible Derpy_pony
<Panda> NINJAZZ DIDNT TELL ME HE WAS LEAVING FOR A WHILE! :[ Om im le sad
<Chimera> So the north was equally cold
<Crimson-Dragon> Storm troopers are accurate?
<Meanwhile> Ryunosuke: Imperial troopers? Accurate?
*alexxm hugs Panda
<Chimera> The Equator equally humid
<Chimera> etc
<Chimera> :U
*RyunosukeKnT shrugs
<CK|Catnap> And again, setting up the scenario and allowing people to deal with it "real" is how reality shows can claim they are "real life"
<Crimson-Dragon> What bullshit are you speaking?
<Light_Latias> 12heh
*Panda hugs Alchemist
<Wrek> 05y u persist to imply its fake CK|Catnap?
<Panda> oops
<Om> Panda: He will have internet at times.
<GilDash> Panda: Hey, I haven't seen him in a couple of days...
<Spy> :);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9
<Panda> Om: :(
<Panda> GilDash: well i talked to him last night ;)
<RyunosukeKnT> SPY IN IN THE BASE
<RaveBrony> Dat emote spam
*Sylandest1 hugs GilDash
<twilight_sprinkle> yay smiley faces
<Vordox> Spy: Warned you about that...
*GilDash hugs Sylandest1.
<Crimson-Dragon> Did anyone kill a red spy on the way here?
<Wrek> 05Spy no emote spam
<GilDash> Panda: Well aren't you peachy. :|
<Angel_Espeon> 13mabe we could somehow balance out the temperature difference between us so we can both have 24C or something? :'D
<Sylandest1> GilDash: well, we'll just have to keep each other occupied while we watch for him, hmm?
<derpy_pony> I want to see him scream for help in delirium because he lost his water reserve
<twilight_sprinkle> aw but emote spam is preeetty
<Om> I talk to im everyday?
<derpy_pony> these things happen
<Malavolent> derpy_pony: :|
<GilDash> Sylandest1: I think I can handle that...
<GilDash> Om: Do you go to work when you have to? Got nothing better to do...
<xxMoopyxx> Ok so my wii console doesn't have java script cause it won't show some of the stuff
<Lil_B> I'm so thirty now... better drink my own water
<Everlasting_Joy> Lil_B: :).
<CK|Catnap> Wrek: Like I said, I don't deny parts are probably legit, but other parts are faked. Or staged, if you prefer. Point is that the show does have some portions that are set up for him for the sake of making the show informative.
<Om> GilDash: What?
<Lil_B> thirsty
<Light_Latias> 12._.
<Wrek> 05staged is a better word than faked
<Chimera> xD
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Dat typo.
<GilDash> Om: Sorry, more Megadeth. \m/
<prince-dari> Oh no, they've set it up so that he has to climb the highest peak in Namibia.
<Chimera> cold earth
<Chimera> :U
<Chimera> oh wait no
<Chimera> that'd be hot
<prince-dari> So clearly that's all fake and needs no skill or strength at all
<Wrek> 05but i think arranged is a better word right?
<prince-dari> And is absolute bullshit
<Light_Latias> 12LOWER
<Meanwhile> CK|Catnap: That sounds different to what you were originally saying.
<Chimera> or warm IDK
<Om> GilDash: I see. You like that group of musical artists :S
<Chimera> well LL
<RyunosukeKnT> why does he HAVE to climb a mountain? :)
<Crimson-Dragon> http://crispychris.deviantart.com/art/K-O-Apple-Bloom-wins-309261357 This made me laugh so hard
<Rain> I love Bear
<Chimera> we need tropics to stay tropic

<xxMoopyxx> ok now im going to bring up another chatroom on my computer hang on real quick

<Wrek> 05Rain: i met him irl :D
<Brandberg-Mountain> COME AT ME BRO :[
<Chimera> plus we lose beach babes
<Chimera> ;A;
<diddutz> CK|Catnap: It's like saying nuclear fission in an nuklear power station is faked because it's set up and happens under controlled circumstances...
<GilDash> Om: Megadeth could be better described as Dave Mustane with backing musicians. :D
<Sundaysmile> pootea
*Chimera RUNS
<Panda> GilDash: um... im always peachy :(

<Rain> Bear is my hero!
<Om> GilDash: OH, right. Cuse I understand that reference :$
<CK|Catnap> Aaaand now that I've got four different people arguing with me over whether a partially faked show is partially faked, I think I'll just shut up. >_>
<Chimera> HAHA

<Everlasting_Joy> He's so English :).
<Wrek> 05it was on the end of a world scout camp here in sweden. on the last night on the big stage he dropped in with a parachute.

*Light_Latias hides
<prince-dari> You clearly don't know the meaning of faked.
<Chimera> XD~
<Lil_B> Random Trivia: Namibia translated means something along the lines of "Land with nothing on it"
<Sundaysmile> bushmen trolled bear
<Chimera> *!
<Rain> also people who say he is fake because sinarios are set up for him are just stupid
<MegaMoonShine> Hi everypony

<Everlasting_Joy> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG3: Dari.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG3> ah
<twilight_sprinkle> nice straw
<prince-dari> Well I think it's rude to call it fake when he's actually doing all of this.
<MegaMoonShine> Where did he get that straw from lol
<Om> He had a part in Finding Nemo, before he died. They cut it out obviously
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG3> prince-dari: ^

<drf-Droid> that's so funny I forgot to laugh
<prince-dari> The bushmen brought the shovel
<GilDash> Sylandest1: The problem is it isn't quite still traffic. It's moving, just really slowly, so eyes have to be on the road. :S
<Light_Latias> 12the nose knows
<Crimson-Dragon> He used two sticks and stone to make it
<Lighty> 13its meant to be not funny

<MadSurge> GilDash: because here "peperone" means pepper (the vegetable, not the spice)
<Le-Mu-Xa> While I wait, I'm going to turn on some more Megaman Starforce Music
<GilDash> Om: Hey, I've nothing wrong with it. I just don't typically associate pepperoni with chocolate. :D

<Aurora> 6freeway
<Aurora> 6either 101 or 1
<GilDash> I can not stand this song. >_<
<Bronysith> ACS13123: skyrim is the lamest game of 2011 along with COD MW3 and BF3
<Aurora> 6oh right
<drf|laptop> 03yeah I dunno
<Kyu> 07from santa cruz, it's 1 isn't it
<Aurora> 6so are you guys flying to LA?

<killerpony7733> GilDash: the music is good for me but the message in it nope
<Aurora> 6ok ask your parents
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Spiders can't get over lips.
<Duo-Exe> Bronysith: At least Skyrim was more entertaining than CoD
<drf|laptop> 03"Capitola next 3 exits"
<Irish_Pony> GilDash: either that or sexy :D
<drf|laptop> 03we just passed
<Aurora> 6being from the area, I might be able to uh
<Bronysith> SirGanjalf: i miss homestar
<Aurora> 6save your butts
<ACS13123> Bronysith: TBH, I like those games, I dont see why they're taken the piss of so much *COUGH COUGH MW3 kids COUGH COUGH*
<drf|laptop> 03we're on freeway 1 right now
<drf|laptop> 03is what my mom said
<ACS13123> And BF3 wasnt bad
<Aurora> 6yeah 1 is pretty
<drf|laptop> 03honestly all we do is punch addresses in the GPS
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god Homestarrunner
<Aurora> 6ask them what highway they're taking to LA though
<Bronysith> ACS13123: cause it is the same exact game every single year
<drf|laptop> 03honestly all we do is punch addresses in the GPS <- this
<Aurora> 6I wouldn't be surprised if you take 101/PCH
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I wouldn't know. I always mute the stream everytime its on.
<drf|laptop> 03whatever highway it tells us to
<Aurora> 6since tourists tend to
<Duo-Exe> You know what upsets me?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: hm, they can cross the lips from ground to wall
<ACS13123> Bronysith: BF3 and MW3 are COMPLETELY different
<CrimsonPhoenix> MW3 is the definition of cashcow
<Sundaysmile> Soooooooo potentially three more months til new MLP episodes
<killerpony7733> GilDash: Fair enough
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03GilDash :(
<Duo-Exe> Sequels arent made due to how a game plays
<Aurora> 6I-5 is faster, but it's literally 4-5 hours of nothing
<Duo-Exe> its how much it sells
<Kyu> 07101 is a much better drive down to LA anyways
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: They can't climb upside down.
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: I could reply with great detail to that, but I won't.
<Aurora> 6plus, it's ridiculously hot
<Bronysith> ACS13123: i mean every year COD is released the same exact game every year
<Om> Scoot-Scootaloo: Don't listen to that sour puss
<GilDash> Scoot-Scootaloo: Hey, nothing personal. I just really dislike the song. :$
<Aurora> 6it was 113 on sunday, and I was stuck in an hour of traffic
<Irish_Pony> GilDash: Please? :(
<Duo-Exe> so a shitty game that sells like CoD will get sequel AFTER SEQUEL AFTE SEQUEL
<Kyu> 07and once you're as far down as monterey, I think it's faster
<GilDash> Scoot-Scootaloo: As I said, the actual video is fantastic. :)
<Ponies47> HEY EVERYPONY! :)
<Aurora> 6so, I'd reccommend 101 even though it's stupidly long
<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: do i need to smack someone? who made you cry"?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: you sure about that? i think i mightve seen it
<drf|laptop> 03I think we're doing 101
<Aurora> 6wait, you're staying in monterey?
<ACS13123> YES!
<Sundaysmile> YES
<drf|laptop> 03if that's the one along the ocean
<CrimsonPhoenix> at least skyrim tried putting new stuff

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Barbie's line, "Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from threat of force!" is based on a quote from Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence. "Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." But it is also a nod to Michael Palin's line in Monty Python and the Holy Grail: "Supreme

<sonicrainboomer259> Silverscreen: what did woody write???
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Shizuka: yup
*PartyCannon gets the tissues ready
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: By the time Toy Story 3 was made, Pixar animators had figured out how to animate things like water and fur. Although being able to realistically animate fur was originally a concern for Toy Story 3 animators, the real animation challenge was trying to animate the trash bags in the movie. Because trash bags have special properties such as how it reflects light,
<Silverscreen> 1,11animators spent weeks trying to get the trash bags correct.
<RaveBrony> Inb4 I effing cry!! :'(
<Meanwhile> Woody is best cowboy.

<Light_Latias> 12-k
<Shizuka> 13you'd think they'd spend forever on some bit set piece, when it's really something small like trash bags
<sonicrainboomer259> this part still affects me
<BlazeAngel> I are so sad. :(
<Sinestro> i had tears the first time i saw this part
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Bo Peep was omitted from the film because her surviving the incinerator was deemed highly unlikely as she was made of porcelain.
<GabeMoist> CREEPER
<SirGanjalf> This movie hits me right in the childhood:(
<Clavicle> are you srs
<TheDarkFreak> uh

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> I CRIED MANLY TEARS
<|Discord|> I SHALL CRY...WHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the end of the original Toy Story, Rex said he hoped Andy would get another dinosaur, preferably a "leaf eater" so he could act as the dominant carnivore. In Toy Story 3 he gets his wish because his new owner, Bonnie, has Trixie.
*Bronysith high fives Shizuka

<Grayhoof> Ooooooo
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> oh god the references touch my heart
<RAWRity> If i was writing this, the movie would end with Andy taking the toys back from the little girl, telling her "YOU'RE PLAYING WITH THEM WRONG!"
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: A piece of concept art found in the book 'The Art of Toy Story 3' shows that originally, Trixie the blue dinosaur was envisioned to be part of Lotso's gang at the daycare center. However, in the final movie she is one of Bonnie's toys and is a friendly character.
<Obsidian> Rexie x Trixie is now canon
<lunac> thiose aliens are collectors items

<Ghosties> 04Now I get it
<Tovler> Its so smooooooth
<K_A> RAWRity: I actually bought one of the first-gen iMacs a year back. I actually loved their design.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> ZOO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Zoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> zoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<DocSane> Star Wars is 7 parts?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Zoo zoo zoo
<Sinestro> 6
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> BEST MOVIE EVAR
<IshBestBullseye> |Discord| it's a trilogy, there was no prequel trilogy, it never happened
<lunac> clone wars film
<Rainbow> What if mlp dolls were in toystory?
<DocSane> In which universe?
<Ghosties> 04Now I get why so many critics and people said it was the most depressing film they'd seen in recent memory
<Sinestro> no
<Sinestro> doesnt count
<StinkomanFan> NO DocSane
<StinkomanFan> NO
<K_A> I'm going to take a guess
<Chrysalis> ohai slurry OC
<Silverscreen> 1,11Starwars, Godfather and Back to the Future all had some issues in one way or another in at least one of their films. Toy Story had a solid plot throughout all three films.
<Tovler> Even better than the Ocean's Trilogy
<Chrysalis> Ghosties had you not seen it before?
<desertman2> How about LotR?
<|Discord|> IshBestBullseye: Ethier I am worng or there where lots of starwars
<lunac> STOP YAYING!
<K_A> The current streamer is totally... Wrek.
<VenHur96> Best trillogy ever, two hoofs down!
<Rainbow> god father 3 was crappy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ghosties: What movie?
<Azureflames66> zoo
<Ghosties> 04That was the first time I ever saw the film
<Ghosties> 04Toy Story 3
<Sinestro> BttF was great besides 3 was meh
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> awww
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> K_A: no its Tom
<Big_Jake-intosh> more Yays
<Polydunami> What do you expect from a time travel movie trilogy, Silverscreen?
<Chrysalis> Ghosties for a family film it is incredibly heavy
<IshBestBullseye> |Discord| then you're wrong
<Sakari> Im going to sleep good night everypony :)
<Wrek> 05ping?
<RaveBrony> Ghosties: You like? :3
<DocSane> So, what's the next trilogy to be streamed?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Ghosties: :O
<Polydunami> Okay, I should go now.
<lunac> Rainbow: Godpony Part3 :)
<RAWRity> DocSane: Terminator
<Ghosties> 04It doesn't get heavy until the end
<Chrysalis> you actually felt for the toys and the kid
<ZappyTheUnicorn> G'night Sakari.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Well Ghosties I hope you enjoyd it
<|Discord|> ish
<K_A> Wrek: I was saying the streamer was totally you.
<Iron_Edge> Suddenly slurry OC -lol
<StinkomanFan> They had an ad campaign with "Take your toys to college"
<CCCP> night Sakari
<owlicious> huh?
<Rainbow> @lunac Lol
<Ghosties> 04I did like it
<RAWRity> BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY 3 TERMINATOR FILMS
<Chrysalis> modern films dont let you get that attatched
<Sinestro> if we did Star wars would we do all 6 or just a single trilogy?
<Ghosties> 04I shed three tears
<RaveBrony> Cya Sakari!
<pony_3419> :'(
<VenHur96> Could be Godfather or BTTF, you'll never know.
<RAWRity> SALVAWHATNOW?
<owlicious> is it looping?
<K_A> Me, too, Fluttershy
<lunac> there's a trailer for it on You Tube Rainbow
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It isn't sad.
<SlurryMoon> 3one sec, trying to set up the shorts
<Silverscreen> 1,11Toy Story also had a great overlaying story and message about growing up, which was a hell of a thing to learn and it enabled itself to grow with its audience.
<Shizuka> 13RAWRity: you mean two
<|Discord|> IshBestBullseye: THere where 5 different starwars
<owlicious> yep
<Whiskra> May I suggest we watch "The Pixar Story" documentary as well? =) It's acctually a great documentary for history about Pixar, Disney and animation in general
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't forget the parody.
<Quicksilver> is that pic getting bigger
<K_A> I usually save this for Friday, so watching this without a pony ep following is a bit surreal.
<Ghosties> 04That's the most they'll get out of me, I refuse to outright b'aww
<Whiskra> It should be on youtube
<lunac> Whats next?
<IshBestBullseye> |Discord| there was one trilogy, thats all there ever was
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Shorts
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: this movie was not meant for parodys :'(
<Chrysalis> Silverscreen it was incredibly well timed for the kids that grew up with one and 2, were leaving home about the time of 3
<|Discord|> IshBestBullseye: Nope look it up
<IowaBrony> Whiskra: Love that documentary.
<lunac> oh
<StinkomanFan> And then Ghosties cried after signing off
<Ghosties> 04I've only outright b'aww'd for one work, and that was Metal Gear Solid 4, had me crying like a babe
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> http://www.personal.psu.edu/jag5232/Assigntment_4_page_1_files/Calvin-and-Hobbes--The-Future.jpg
