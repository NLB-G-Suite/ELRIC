<Pinkieruler124> Oh goddd
*ScootaChicken holds on to LadyCanary
<RaveBrony> Lol
<TOY_PON3> Dark_Horst: Yes i do
<Eulshy> you think deadspace was scary?
<DeadpoolDash> books
<RaveBrony> tl,dr
<Jim> If you really want to get scared by it, you must sit down and be immersed by the game
<CCCP> Dead Space is not verry scary
<ScootaChicken> I be scared.
*PinkiePieCopy makes amnesia noises at ScootaChicken
<LadyCanary> Dont be scared. and OH GOD ITS DARK
<Jaketehsnake> tl;dr
<ScootaChicken> NOPE.
<Meanwhile> I LOVE the dark.
<Pinkieruler124> Scoota !
<DeadpoolDash> turn up the gamma
<CK|Asleep> Amnesia is scary because it produces an environment in which you breed your own horror. Dead Space just makes monsters pop out of vents. You're scared for all of two seconds, then you pump it full of lead and it's over.
<flutter_spin> O.o
<ScootaChicken> Pinkieruler124!
<Eulshy> oooh dark rooom ooooh
<Jaketehsnake> Darkness is like the sarchia sauce of scary
<Polydunami> Who's streaming and how far is he into the game?
<AppleEric> outside in october is enough to give me the chills
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord is streaming, about ten minutes.
<PinkiePieCopy> Wrek just started
<Jim> We've just started the game
<Yahooz> So chat and voice reactions at the same time, eh? This should be fun to watch :3333
<Pinkieruler124> Hides off to scoota
<Eulshy> *ghost noises*
<RoboGerbil> hes like 2 rooms in
<Polydunami> Oh
<CK|Asleep> In that respect, Dead Space is the lowest common demon of horror: the jumpscare.
<Kipkat07> END MY PAIN ALREADY AND SCARE ME!!!!!
<PinkiePieCopy> Not wrek, Nittany my bad
<PinkiePieCopy> XD
<Polydunami> Nice, but I have to leave soom
<AppleEric> and then a wild clown appeared

<RoboGerbil> yeh clkimb that bookshelf

<Meanwhile> No one can see you coming in the dark...

<Silver_Streak> Whats the pinkie pie blood for?
<Polydunami>
<otakon> um
<Dark_Horst> well, it's an indie game, you expect good voicework from an indie game?
<CK|Asleep> Frankly, Dead Space is the worst sort of horror: it's jumpscares. That's not true horror, that's 2 seconds of scary followed by the sound of gunfire. >_>
<flutter_spin> letter to yourself
<Eulshy> look ink
*Kipkat07 is pissing himself
<Pinkies4thWall> KILLMAIMDESTROYMURDERDEATHKILL
<Yahooz> Sure ScootaChicken whats your skype?

<flutter_spin> I guess he wrote a letter incase he forgot :P
*TOY_PON3 is not sure to take you guys seriously or just joking
<otakon> okay, that's kind of creepy
<WafflesLovesDepry> -.-
<CK|Asleep> Hell, Left 4 Dead 2 is better at horror than Dead Space.
<Otaku> <Linuxer> 02Now Playing: 03Oh! Edo Rocket - Oh Edo Nagareboshi IV02
<otakon> TOY_PON3: mixed results
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Eulshy> it was daniel with the quill in the back room
<PinkiePieCopy> AppleEric, you just got convinced, prepare to shit yourself
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken has a keyboard made of brick.
<Silver_Streak> DAAAAAAAAARK
<RAWRity> you guys should be happy. An actress named Octavia won an Oscar!
<TOY_PON3> Okay forget I said anything about Dead Space DROP IT!
*Silver_Streak hides
<Polydunami> Hellooooooooo Rainbow Dash!
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: withthelightsout1991 (and leave me alone about it I was in my Nirvana phase)
<flutter_spin> O.o
<Jaketehsnake> His rapid camera movments are giving me whiplash
<Eulshy> still not scared
*TOY_PON3 grows irritated
<AppleEric> but i have a bladder on the brink of pee so i think i might need to change myself later.
<WafflesLovesDepry> U might need to hide i think..
<RoboGerbil> eneter my secret room
<Pinkies4thWall> ScootaChicken: What just happened
<CK|Asleep> At least there it's an uncontrolled environment full of enemies and it builds a feeling of helplessness even as you mow down opposition. Dead Space, you're a one man army, why would you be scared of ANYTHING?
<DeadpoolDash> magic stone door opens
<Dark_Horst> oh i dunno, dead space one did a good job with it's " oh god, just let me off this goddamn ship already" feel
<CupcakeWarrior> secretdoorsecretdoor
<Pinkieruler124> When is the scareynees is coming?
<Dark_Horst> dead space 2 was kinda lame
*Silver_Streak whimpers
<TOY_PON3> CK|Asleep: I said drop it....
<Polydunami> I love unsettling atmosphere in a game
<PinkiePieCopy> About a minte
*SilverSonic slaps Otaku around a bit with a massive wrench
<Eulshy> should i feel scared yet?
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/DMZXy

<flutter_spin> But watching is... different
<Pinkieruler124> Yes be scared!....NOW!
<Polydunami> Pinkie is gonna eat me.
<herp-a-derp> first monster appereance coming up
<Dark_Horst> watching horror games doesn't scare people
<Silver_Streak> oh shit freaky
<PinkiePieCopy> No, you should think it's not too bad
<DeadpoolDash> common sense would tell you to break a window and get the hell out
<CK|Asleep> Pft, why? You're the one who wanted to know why Amnesia was good and Dead Space wasn't. :p
<RoboGerbil> the glowy door
<Polydunami> What do I do.
<CCCP> RaveBrony: i think its cute :3
<PinkiePieCopy> Now open the door
<AppleEric> im afraid to go to any link

<flutter_spin> connected to the ... neck bone
<AppleEric> oh ehll
<Polydunami>
<Jaketehsnake> CKaasleep One word, Teammates. Dead Space you are alone. You are VERY alone. Alone scares eople. LEft 4 dead you have 3 other buddies joking at eachother over voice chat
<Bluestrom_S> who's playing?
<PinkiePieCopy> SON OF A

<kenne88> wonder if someones tried to make a canterlot castle version of this
<Pinkieruler124> Let me guess...Scarey part?
<CK|Asleep> jaketehsnake: Yes, and? It's still the sense that you need to work together to survive
<TOY_PON3> CK|Asleep: Dead Space made me jump. It didn't make me shit myself neither did Amnesia or Left 4 Dead 2

<otakon> DeadpoolDash: so am I >:)
*Silver_Streak runs away for a bit
<MakerDusk> otakon: my one desire right now is to be on a snowmobile
<CK|Asleep> You're four ordinary people trapped in a poor environment. In Dead Space you're a gun-toting army.
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: I don't think this is helping...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I wish I had snow over here ;__;
<Polydunami> READY!
<AppleEric> tommorow is already off for me
<PinkiePieCopy> We are all fucked now
<otakon> MakerDusk: I can understand taht
<MakerDusk> Pinkieruler124: damnit, I just lost the game
<Meanwhile> Well that's good because I'm not trying to help.
<flutter_spin> O.o
<AppleEric> it is a make up day for snow days
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: that explains everything.

<CK|Asleep> If you're scared of Dead Space, like legitimately beyond just the jumpscares, then you're quite frankly weird. I tend to laugh after a good jumpscare, because they aren't that bad. XD
<Jaketehsnake> Anyone else up for some left 4 dead? This is kind of borning, No offense Nittany, I just dont like lets play

<Silver_Streak> O.O :'(
<Jim> later TOY_PON3
<CK|Asleep> TOY: But we already established that you're weird.
<Yahooz> typing ?
<Iota> There you go SilverSonic
<CK|Asleep> For being scared of Dead Space. :p
<Kipkat07> MY PANTS ARE WET!!!!!!!!!
<TOY_PON3> CK|Asleep: I'm not weird I just don't scared that easily

<Meanwhile> No it isn't.
<Pinkieruler124> Ok
<TOY_PON3> But Amnesia c'mon
<DeadpoolDash> bad games scare me
<Jaketehsnake> This game isnt scray in the same sense as Dead Space, THis creats atmosphere and story, Dead Space jumpscares you and makes you feel alone and overwhelmed.

<valoreins> hellooo
<RaveBrony> Do you eventually have to fight, chase, or at least somewhat interact with something scary? T.T
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Scary comes from being in a dark room alone wearing headphones while actualling playing the game.
*Silver_Streak is scared by the noises
<Blank_Flank> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&src_vid=C0C59h1nlwg&annotation_id=annotation_842992&v=rHG-JO8gIGk
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Actually*
<Capn_fisty> sure, ill just finish up the survey thing and i will be right on
<kenne88> it would be scary if he didnt just breeze through it
<Dashie_Dashie> SuperBrony64, the only scary game I remember play ever was "Alone in the Dark" for the playstation 1.

<Silver_Streak> i hear skype
<CK|Asleep> And perhaps a few moats
<Yahooz> So has anyone seen lagx's reaction vids to this XD?

<kenne88> lol
<flutter_spin> lagx? I've seen a ton of different ones. I don't remember that one. I have avoided a playthrough
<Eulshy> scary is reading a note and the note says im behind you and as you read it you turn around and they are nehind you
<Silver_Streak> i'm gonna get dinner going... i'm starved
<CCCP> Dashie_Dashie: what if the axe murder is a girl?

<TOY_PON32> MahBoi777: It won't happen again
<TOY_PON32> emangamer: Really?
<MahBoi777> :D
<Pale_Horse> Here's a question. I know the brony community loves to mix ponies into all their other favorite media ("it's now 20% cooler!"), and for most stuff it is indeed improved. but are there any notable examples that don't really seem to work as well when ponies are added?... For example, the movie "Seabiscuit" becomes really surreal if it's about the lives of 3 pony stallions affected by a championship racing human. :/

<valoreins> i wanna torture everypony here >:D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJnK_KS4G9k&feature=related
<emangamer> 15 black
<Zealot> EKARD
<emangamer> good god
<Drake> 04NS
*Drake hugs
<emangamer> thats insane
<valoreins> i challange you to watch newborn cuties!
<Iago> :D
*Iago hugs back
<Drake> 04How are you?
<emangamer> Shizuka: we seriously need to have a conversation about the cards you have
<Iago> tired
<Shizuka> 13don't know what i have though
<Shizuka> 13that's my problem with TCGs... way way way way way way too many cards to keep track of
*Pinkies4thWall heard 3.5, pressed ctrl+w
<TOY_PON32> Still talking about cards?
*TOY_PON32 leaves
<Pinkies4thWall> yup
<Pale_Horse> I used to have a red Dwarven Warrior/Shocker combo deck that was pretty spiffy.
<emangamer> Shizuka: it really goes into teh deep recesses of your brain
<GrimGallop> lol
<emangamer> I couldnt tell you any of the cards in alara block
<JustaninnocentPony> oh god, the animation in that is HORRID
<Shizuka> 13yeah but i prefer those recesses to be filled with ponies
<DaringDude> poleman cards ftw
<emangamer> but you gimmie some flavor text or art
<Drake> 04:<
<DaringDude> pokeman
*Drake hugs
<emangamer> and it comes flowing back to me
<SilverSonic> NS
<DaringDude> pokemanz
<SilverSonic> DRAKE
<SilverSonic> Mr. WONDERMAN
<Iago> heya SilverSonic :D
<GrimGallop> lol
<DaringDude> pokemon
<SilverSonic> Hiya :D
<Pinkies4thWall> valoreins: if you're gonna troll, it needs to troll immediately
*Iago derpface
<GrimGallop> I still see no stream. There should be a stream. :(
<Drake> 04Hi SilverSonic
<JustaninnocentPony> pokemon was better when there was only 150 of the little bastards x.x
<valoreins> not a troll... just a challenge :p
<BritishBrony> :3
<Pinkies4thWall> le me: YES! JUST CAUGHT MEWTWO! POKEDEX FULL!
<SilverSonic> i did something very random
<valoreins> and i survived!
<SilverSonic> i made a chair dance without me dancing in hit
<SilverSonic> it*
<SilverSonic> but im sitting in the chair
<SilverSonic> XD
<emangamer> Shizuka: but yea...one day we need to have a more indepth conversation about the cards you have
<emangamer> and kirzstryfe I would like to hear more about these alpha packs
<Pinkies4thWall> le TV: coming soon! Pokemanz gold and silver!
<emangamer> you have sparked my interest with that
<Drake> 04o_o
<Pinkies4thWall> le me: FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Drake> 04I understood nothing
<Pale_Horse> it was nice, because the dwarven warriors could make another creature with power 2 or less unblockable for a turn, and the Shockers were 1/1 creatures that whenever they dealt damage to an opponent, that opponent had to discard all cards in their hand and draw that many cards from their deck.
<SilverSonic> thats the thing XD
<emangamer> Pale_Horse: sounds overpowered
<RoflBot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6LN4lWcABQ&feature=related
<SilverSonic> i say things that are completely ununderstandable
<emangamer> you know what card was actually kinda OP
<SilverSonic> and yay new word :p
<emangamer> goblin siege-gang
<emangamer> that card was pretty damn broken
<Pinkies4thWall> dat lol
<emangamer> siege-gang commander was really good
<SilverSonic> anyways
<SilverSonic> tomorrow is a big day for me
<Pinkies4thWall> Back soon.
<SilverSonic> i take my placement test to see if i can get into college

<Drake> 04and stalk May
<Drake> 04And make her respond to my emails
<Zealot|Sleep> .

<Drake> 04That would be wicked NS
<emangamer> that card is just pure crap
<Drake> 04We all crash at Altair's
<emangamer> IDK why everyone plays it
<Drake> 04you have your first joint
<emangamer> I can see the appeal, but it's just not my style
<Drake> 04and I just sit back staring at you guys thinking "What is up with all these guys"
<emangamer> even thought I do like to play U/B controll
<Suiseiseki> 03You'd all crash at my house :<
<TOY_PON32> emangamer: It's just the fact that I haven't played Yu-GI-Oh in like forever so I get lost in convo
<emangamer> now U/B controll vs U/B controll
<emangamer> THAT is a really fun match up
<emangamer> very intelectually challenging
<Iago> lmfao
<Iago> and yes
<Iago> then we'd crash Sneas' place
<Iago> and sit on the server
<Iago> "oops"

<MahBoi777> hmmmmm, what kind of secrets?
<Iago> Say something like "Oh, you called me a nigger? I fail to see how I'm a 'nigger'. I was under the impression that the typical meaning of 'nigger' means 'black person'. As you can see, that is not so. Please rephrase your stupidity into something more logical. Thank you for playing the game."
<RoboGerbil> still no feed?

*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Shy
<Silver_Streak> the new voice was half assed
<TOY_PON32> If only they kept her new voice, kept the eyes, and the name. It would've been all good.
<BritishBrony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=Aih_-483uVk
<TOY_PON32> But I'm not complaining anymore
<Pinkies4thWall> Well, just don't hate. they could've eliminated her from the rest of the show
<TOY_PON32> ^
<MahBoi777> yah, I was a little sad when RD didn't say Derpy, but oh well I guess
<TOY_PON32> I still love Hasbro

<SilverSonic> did i ever tell you that one of our teachers got kicked in the head a few years ago by a student .-.
<MahBoi777> nope
<valoreins> it's awful, just awful
<TOY_PON32> It was heartbreaking
<BritishBrony> "Be careful, you don't want to do more damage then you've you've alrready done."
<Pinkies4thWall> might as well have never voiced derpy to begin with.
<SilverSonic> it was like 3 or 4 years ago it suppoedly happned
<BritishBrony> I almost cried.
<MahBoi777> egad, what did I do now? lol
<SilverSonic> the teacher commited suicide in 2009

<Bluestrom_S> can we get some mythbusters
<SilverSonic> yyeah ._.
<Iago> ._.

<Silver_Streak> the vid is too sad...
*Pinkies4thWall exited the tab before derpy appeared
<SilverSonic> and then last year a senior commited suicide for unknown reasons
<SilverSonic> ._.
<TOY_PON32> It would be a miracle if they call Derpy her name again
<MahBoi777> TT_TT
<SilverSonic> infact it was only 1 year and 5 days ago it happened
<TOY_PON32> Seriously a miracle
<Pinkies4thWall> Stubio B now has -75% respect
<TOY_PON32> No don't blame them
<SilverSonic> it was a top student as well
<TOY_PON32> Blame the soccer moms

<BritishBrony> Tbh we were lucky to have her talk in the first place...
<TOY_PON32> Studio B has done so much why you hate them over some stupid issue?
<MahBoi777> BritishBrony: tru dat
<TOY_PON32> Just because Derpy was changed doesn't mean we have to get angry and revolt
<Silver_Streak> i'm not angry revolting
<TOY_PON32> Hell we're better than that
<MahBoi777> I'm not angry at all
<Silver_Streak> i'm revolting because it's insulting to me
*MahBoi777 throws away torch and pitchfork
<BritishBrony> Exactly. SHe still gets a part on that episode- they didn't comepletely cut it off. It could be worse.
<TOY_PON32> Just let it go man

<Bluestrom_S> http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/q7s15/lets_end_the_sadness_and_be_optimistic/
<Silver_Streak> i'm incapable of crying over a scene like this
<Ingwaz> Pinkies4thWall: it is not studio b's fault
<TOY_PON32> Bluestrom_S: Indeed
<RainbowJack> TOY_PON32 we the community we ned to say that we arent mad but we arrent happy with what happend to her
<TOY_PON32> Ingwaz: I was trying to explain that
<Ingwaz> TOY_PON32: you did not do so concisely enough
<Ingwaz> or i suspect you did not since you were apparently still trying
<MahBoi777> bananas
<TOY_PON32> RainbowJack: I know that. I'm not happy but I won't get angry
<Silver_Streak> it isn't their fault at all. but they could've at least changed it to something less half assed
<TOY_PON32> Ingwaz: Studio B has done enough we can't expect more from them
<Pinkies4thWall> Ingwaz: but it IS sombody's fault. I'm one who will love/ tolerate, but I need to talk with whoever is the one that, if quiet, this never would have happened
<TOY_PON32> Just let it go...
<Wrek> 05you know i love every single one of you right?
<TOY_PON32> Derpy will be around forever she's no dead
<MahBoi777> put a banana in ur ear, yes put a ripe banana right into your favorite ear, lol
<Wrek> 05right?
<Ingwaz> it is as many have said before me, there are many factors that could have caused this to happen. Several possibilities that leave it out of Hasbro's hands. Right now it is important that we wait patiently and calmly and remember our motto of love and tolerate, we need to wait for official word from hasbro
<Suiseiseki> 03nini :<
<Ingwaz> Wrek: i find that to be highly unlikely
*Pinkies4thWall huggles Wrek
<Dismo> What's everypony saddlesore about now?
<TOY_PON32> Wrek: I love you too
<MahBoi777> seems illogical
*RainbowJack hugs Wrek
<Pinkies4thWall> Derpy
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Ingwaz> Dismo: its best to simply not ask about it
<SilverSonic> nini :(
<Silver_Streak> we can't just sit here and do nothing or we'll all just fall through the floor
<MahBoi777> Dismo: nuthin, we were discussing bananas
<Dismo> >w> ..... Okay then.... I'm watching you.
<TOY_PON32> Hasbro failed to inform us this was happening. Thats what they messed up with
<Silver_Streak> that's another thing derpy taught in that scene
<MahBoi777> :$
<Ingwaz> Silver_Streak: we are not saying you should do nothing, instead, write to hasbro in a clear and concise way explaining why you feel this is wrong. be sure to remain respectful, but assert your view on it as well
<Pinkies4thWall> that's a derpy in the display!
<TOY_PON32> ^
<BritishBrony> :3
<Dismo> :I People are bitching about the writers or something? Why? Either don't watch it or be thankfull it's not canclled?
<Pinkies4thWall> So we spam hasbro with polite emails?
<Ingwaz> Pinkies4thWall: her hair seems a bit too long, it might be daisy
<Pinkies4thWall> Oh
<Pinkies4thWall> And RD looks pale
<Ingwaz> Pinkies4thWall: spam no, send emails once containing your views and why you feel this is wrong
<TOY_PON32> Look no matter what happens in the future we will always love Derpy Hooves
<Silver_Streak> I definately remain respectful. remember i'm a lady. I can fight in ways men can't. i will be professional about it. I am being professional. See my youtube vid i posted? That just the start.
<Pinkies4thWall> Spam: the community, one per i meant
<Ingwaz> TOY_PON32: we all know that, that much is obvious, the problem is what may happen in the future considering the precident this could set
<BritishBrony> There is a petition to change the scene back... http://www.change.org/petitions/hasbro-studiosthe-hub-return-derpys-scene-in-the-last-roundup-to-normal#
<MahBoi777> I want to say Silver_Steak, but it's Silver_Streak.....I liek steak
<Ingwaz> Silver_Streak: men are just as capable in fighting using methods rather than brawn if they choose to do so
<Pinkies4thWall> yeah.
<TOY_PON32> Ingwaz: Thats what I'm afraid of..
<BronyDanceParty> SHY?
<Pinkies4thWall> i signed one earlier
<Dashie_Dashie> Let's poke at it some more, I'm sure hasbro wont bucket the show in spite of us.
<TOY_PON32> I just dont want Bronies to fall apart because of this
<Pinkies4thWall> but i'm afraid of brony ragers who flame hasbro
<Silver_Streak> don't think i don't know that Ingwaz. I do know that. Just some get way angry fast is all. i didn't say all
<Ingwaz> signing the petitions only does so much, due to the massive amount of emails that was sent out to hasbro's email boxes, they had to block them, you are better off sending the emails personally
<Pinkies4thWall> that'll fuck it up for us
<BritishBrony> Why don't we just accept it.
<TOY_PON32> ^
<MahBoi777> YES WHY
<TOY_PON32> Accept it and go on
<Dismo> "Wont bucket the show" -Most ofthe veiwers and income from toys/Clothing/Soon to be DVD's Are/Will be from us.
<Ingwaz> Silver_Streak: indeedsome do, but i have met many a woman who was quicker to anger than i
<Silver_Streak> :|
<Pinkies4thWall> Accept, but push for change and hope that works
<Silver_Streak> lol see that can be true on both ends
<MahBoi777> STEAK
<TOY_PON32> Pinkies4thWall: Indeed
<TOY_PON32> I didnt know Silver_Streak was a woman btw lol
<Pinkies4thWall> Accept and move on is a move of defeat
<Silver_Streak> Lol i am. I am a woman
<MahBoi777> O_o.....oops

<MASF123> Silver_Streak is a girl?
<RainbowJack> @All: we must stay true to the motto Love and Tollerate sure we might have been saddent about the events that happend but please i think it will be alright
<Silver_Streak> Yes i am watch the vid and see for yourself
<MahBoi777> how does one type like a woman?
<TOY_PON32> Indeed RainbowJack
<Silver_Streak> I use caps
<Silver_Streak> most of the time
<Pinkies4thWall> Pegasister, while gender-specific, i believe is not a justifiable term
<Ingwaz> silver...we see nothing, theres a picture of someone in a fursuit in the background, and a disembodied voice
<MahBoi777> LIKE THIS??
<TOY_PON32> MahBoi777: You should know :D
<TOY_PON32> Just kidding
<Silver_Streak> and complete scentances most of the time
<Silver_Streak> lol
<Silver_Streak> love it
<Wrek> 05anyways
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON32: OH U
<Dismo> .-. What's going on? Why is everypony bitching? No season 3? No movie? Are they doing something to it.
<Silver_Streak> But my spelling can still fail :P
<TOY_PON32> Yes Wrek?
<valoreins> the MLP fandom is in its lowest condition because of this event, fuel on friendship is low today
<Dismo> I need the info
<Pinkies4thWall> Man, woman, boy, or girl, we're all bronies
<Wrek> 05i dont give a fuck, hi Silver_Streak, your sex is unimportant here. gl hf!
<MASF123> Haha your waering 3D glasses!!!

<Placebo> Hey everyone.
<Ingwaz> we'd rather not have it brought up once again and have to go through the entire process of explaining everything all over again
<valoreins> hi Placebo

<Placebo> TOY_PON32: <3
<Silver_Streak> ME
<Pinkies4thWall> Pegasister is now less easily recognizable as a term than "brony"
<Anonymoose> Damn Hub! I'm not willing to get up a 7:00 A.M. Just to watch a cartoon. Also, I have cox, and require a FUCKING cable box. <_<
<Pinkies4thWall> and i wear glasses
<Wrek> 05which is why you will never be respected in my eyes GrimGallop
<Saturn> 08,01brony is a unisex term
<Silver_Streak> I'm a pagasister!
<Pinkies4thWall> I'm a cox
<Wrek> 05sexism is sooo 1990's
<MASF123> All this time I thought Silver_Streak was a guy. Haha :D

<Ingwaz> no you're not, your application to be considered a pegasister was rejected
<TrixieMuffin> Im a muffin

<RainbowJack> back to the future
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Teen ponies?
<Kammerjunk> That's strangely scary.
<Phase4> it'd be interesting
<KwakLad> Kammerjunk: Teenies :p
<Kammerjunk> I see what you did there.
<Phase4> not g2 teens, they were silly
<Phase4> bad silly
<alexxm> revenge of the nerds

<Onyxiaz> CUTE FACES EVERYWHERE
<Phase4> cinema scope
<Sumica> 00,10Is that like that comic where pinkie is auatistic?
<fillyfillyy> Pinkie Pie is best crazy!
<Kammerjunk> My headcanon (Which I'm pretty scared of for various reasons) is that Celestia ordered the extinction of the seaponies because they were freaks of nature.
<Sumica> 00,10and the whole frieds thing is all in her head.
<Damsus> pinkie takes reality, zips it up, dugs a hole, throws it into a hole builds a house on top of the hold and moves into the house on top of the hole she dug
<Phase4> ....you should see someone about that Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> I should.
<dshannon> mhmm
<dshannon> sorta
<KwakLad> happy pinkie generates happy
<Kammerjunk> ^
<dshannon> except pinkie is even more of a diety
<Snuffsis> Pinkie always brings a smile, for some reason.
<RawketLawnchair> Whoever is streaming should play that 'Save Derpy' video. Time for sadness.
<Thunderpony> Reading rainbow

*Amras0000 needs link to this
<Thunderpony> The mare to colt ratio is like 90/4
<Kammerjunk> Dat Office-
<LordCelestia> 0,5that would be 45/2
<Kammerjunk> Thunderpony: Well, duh.
<Scavender> Well, time for me to return to work, goodbye everypony.
<Thunderpony> No wonder the colts don't seem to be bothered by anything
<Sumica> 00,10you all like this song right?
<Thunderpony> I'm ok with it
<Phase4> LordCelestia: 22.5
<Kammerjunk> Equestria is a female-dominated society.
<Amras0000> I'm ok with it
<LordCelestia> 0,590/4 = 45/2 = 22.5/1
<LordCelestia> 0,5oops
<Kammerjunk> Stallions are supressed.
<LordCelestia> 0,5damn it
<LordCelestia> 0,5= 90/4 = 45/2 = 22.5/1
<Amras0000> o.o
<Amras0000> 0/4=0
<Phase4> see? ponies + communisim lead to math
<Sumica> 00,10nooooo you devided by zero
<fillyfillyy> /0!!!!!!
<valoreins> most stallions work as royal guard
<Kencolt> On the other hoof, EVERYCOLT is almost guarnteed to havd a date at the prom?
<Amras0000> wait, what?
<Amras0000> Sumica: nopony divided by 0
<Thunderpony> GO DISCORD
<Amras0000> only divided 0
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: No, Amras0000 divided with 0 :D
<Kammerjunk> yay~
<Phase4> 1/0
<Phase4> :P
<fillyfillyy> 0/0!!!!
<Sumica> 00,10I kinda like this pmv.
<BronyinJapan2> Whats happneing im getting disconnected from the sever twice
<valoreins> or just pmv?
<Kencolt> Phase4-- MY GOD. You actually came up with a working solution!

<LordCelestia> 0,5Isn't Pi infinite?
<Snuffsis> x^4-2x^2-3=0 I shortened it by making x^2 = t so it became t^2-2t-3=0 and then did t=2/2 +-sqrt (-2/2)^2+3) but this gives me wrong answer. :/
<Kencolt> And somehow, at 54, I'm still older than you?

<BronyinJapan> lol
<DeadpoolDash> the I posted is good

<Saturn> 08,01ofna01: do you accept commissions?

<ThatsAShinySky> Now ofna01, hope for a pet RD
<ofna01> before i decided to come home
<CountDoofus> so did Forrest Gump, except he ran
<Jim> Mama always told me life is like a box of chocolates
<Kammerjunk> I lost my dog once, too.
<ThatsAShinySky> CountDoofus: Walk, forrest walk!
<Jim> I don't like chocolates
<Kammerjunk> She was very old, and cancer got her.
<Kammerjunk> I know that feel, ofna01.
<CountDoofus> Run, florist, run! (name that movie?)
<Jim> http://arch.413chan.net/I_know_that_feel_brony-(n1301655838986).png

<Snuffsis> Mafia

<Snuffsis> A very good parody movie
<CountDoofus> no promises if it'll ever get there, tho
<ofna01> thank you whoever gave me the link
<ofna01> i literally just lol'd
<BronyinJapan> to what ?
<CountDoofus> heh, gonna make that my next A movie choice :)
<Snuffsis> haha
<BronyinJapan> Your welcome ofna01
<CountDoofus> that or The Naked Gun
<ofna01> thx brony
<Tovler> Posture, Luigi!
<BronyinJapan> funny TF2 vid
<Phase4> my god
<Phase4> i just relised something
<Kammerjunk> We should totally watch a 3½ hour film on Friday.
<Jim> Ponies are awesome?
<BronyinJapan> Jim whats new?
<Tovler> I'm picking a super-long move for A.
<ofna01> pootis
<Phase4> Saturn: with lvm + pm-hibernate it should be posible to create the same sort of snapshoting vm's have native on linux
<Tovler> I don't know any long B movies.
<CountDoofus> all three Lord of the Rings movies in a row?
<BronyinJapan> Meet the Spatans
<Saturn> 08,01good god
<CountDoofus> Phase: I didn't understand any of that :D
<Saturn> 08,01why can't any of you use "your" and "you're" correctly?
<BronyinJapan> lol
<Phase4> because we are internet folk
<Snuffsis> Why not watch "The Deluge" It's a 315minute long movie about Sweden invading Poland. :D
<BronyinJapan> wtf
<Saturn> 08,01"your" - denotes posession
<Saturn> 08,01"you're" - a contraction of "you are"
<Phase4> ^
<Saturn> 08,01seriously guys, learn grammar
<Tovler> I'm picking Fiddler on the Roof for A.
*Phase4 has been trying to improve his use of contractions
<CountDoofus> anyone in particular you're talking to, Saturn?
<Tovler> The want the difference between Its and It's?
<Snuffsis> Don't forget Its'
<BronyinJapan> this is the internet there is no such thing as goog grammar
<Snuffsis> very important
<CountDoofus> never mind my last, just found it
<Phase4> CountDoofus: imagine being able to save the state of your computer, like with hibernate, and recalling it later
<BronyinJapan> Tovler good choice man
<Snuffsis> Saturn would probably like this clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4vf8N6GpdM
<Tovler> Well Saturn, I'm glad you brought that up, my dear. I say, I'm glad you brought that up.
<BronyinJapan> Tovler lolol
<CountDoofus> inb4 intro reminds me of Inglorious Basterds
<Snuffsis> Haha.
<Saturn> 08,01"it's" = "it is", or posessive of "it"
<Saturn> 08,01nothing else
<Saturn> 08,01wait, no, that's wrong
<Saturn> 08,01"its" is possessive
*Saturn 08,01is confused now
<Tovler> So it's, "Where's its head" not "Where's it's head"?
<Snuffsis> haha
<Saturn> 08,01f[yay]k grammar. i'm gonna go eat some ponies and watch some burgers
<Snuffsis> Where is it is head?
<Snuffsis> don't think so
<Saturn> 08,01Tovler: aye
<Snuffsis> Can you differentiate between Sisters, Sister's and Sisters' ? :P
<Tovler> And "a unicorn's magic matches the color its eyes."
<Jim> Sisters = plural of sister
<BronyinJapan> Saturn you did not put a period at the end of your sentence.
<Jim> Sister's = something your sister possess
<ofna01> Tovler
<ofna01> i didnt know that
<CountDoofus> HOLY SNAP! MLP figurines in the local McDonalds Happy Meals! junkfood for a week, I'm-a-coming!
<Jim> Awesome CountDoofus
<Snuffsis> Jm sister's = Sister is. :P
<Jim> derp
<Snuffsis> Sisters' would be something she owns.
<Jim> Been 5 years since I had English in school
<Kammerjunk> CountDoofus: Not in Denmark.
<Kammerjunk> feelsbadman.jpg
<Jim> No McDonalds over here so I know that feel
<Snuffsis> That is wrong actually, that is the plural, if you have several sisters and they own something together, it's your sisters' stuff. :P
<Kammerjunk> Wow, really?
<Kammerjunk> No McDonalds at all?
<CountDoofus> meh... upon closer inspection, I'm not so thrilled anymore
<Snuffsis> McDonalds suck!
<Kammerjunk> CountDoofus: Do they look like horseapples?
<CountDoofus> "sucks".
<Snuffsis> Where i live in Sweden we have mAx, cloests McDonalds is in the next town. :P
<Jim> Well, there's 600 kilometers to the nearest McDonalds
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, the 's' does not make it plural.
<valoreins> finished filling the bronystudy :D
<Kammerjunk> Jim: Ah. You live in the country?
<Tovler> or would it be "Unicorns' magic matches the color of their eyes?"
<Kammerjunk> valoreins: I'm still going at it.
<Jim> I live in a city of 50'000 inhabitants
<valoreins> i'm a bit confused with some question though...
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<Snuffsis> Tovler, if you are talking about plural, then yes.
<CountDoofus> http://mcdonalds.be/nl/index_NL.php?page=kids all in dutch, but if you click on "klik hier voor meer info" (in green), you'll see what I mean
<Snuffsis> " A Unicorns magic matches..." and "Those Unicorns' magic matches...."
<ofna01> *sniff* that was good japan
<Jim> CountDoofus: Do want
<Tovler> I only want the McDonalds toys for their show-accurate Fluttershy
<BronyinJapan> the video?
<ofna01> yeah
<Kammerjunk> CountDoofus: MFW I understood that word by word.
<Kammerjunk> I don't even speak Dutch.
<Phase4> lawl, pokemon + pony
<CountDoofus> but they got the cutie marks all wrong :(
<BronyinJapan> gad you liked it
<ofna01> just give the cutie mark crusaders their marks already!!!
<RoboGerbil> anyone streaming?
<Phase4> k, i gota reboot. brb
<Kammerjunk> CountDoofus: Yeah, I raged a bit at the Cutie Marks.
<Snuffsis> Buyt what would their purpose on the show be then?
<ofna01> http://equestria-prevails.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d4ctp49
<BronyinJapan> yes plz do it now:[
<Jim> I love that Pinkie Pie they've got CountDoofus
<Tovler> A direct sequel to Pokemon Black/White? due
<Kammerjunk> Also, their muzzles looks kind of weird.
<Kammerjunk> "Typically how many hours do you spend each week on the internet (include all internet activities)?"
<Kammerjunk> Is "all the time" a number?
<CountDoofus> oh well. bought this today, and I'm happy nonetheless. http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/File:Pony_School_Pals_playset_with_Cheerilee,_Apple_Bloom,_Scootaloo_and_Sweetie_Belle.jpg
<BronyinJapan> to much to count and care
<CountDoofus> broken link is broken. one sec
<Kammerjunk> CountDoofus: Works for me.
<Kammerjunk> And that's neat-o.
<CountDoofus> oh
<Tovler> I'll try and be more mindful of my internet activities so I know how long I'm doing stuff here.
<valoreins> btw how long i've been here?
<Phase4> !ping
<Kammerjunk> With MLP, at least I could round up the hours I'm not at school.
<Phase4> Damnit
<Phase4> my pc didnt hibernate
<Kammerjunk> I'm on the Internet even at school.
<ofna01> : |
<ofna01> Phase!

<Jim> Awesome

<Saturn> 08,01whoops
<Saturn> 08,01i mean
<Saturn> 08,01Snuffsis: 13^4 x^2
<ofna01> of course Count would post that
<LordCelestia> Ohai
<CountDoofus> hiya LC
<LordCelestia> I'm home from school hehe
<LordCelestia> Temporarily
<Jim> Welcome back LC
<Snuffsis> Saturn: Really? Sounds weird, but i'll try that! :P
<gunthler> im on a proxy at school right now, trying to get on YT and this buffering is so damn slow
<LordCelestia> I'm headed to work

<BronyinJapan> ofna01 lol love the guys vids
<Kwaklad1> Mine little pony
<ofna01> YES
<ofna01> *in heavy voice* YEES
<Jim> ofna01: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/748553-11-mine-little-pony-v11/
<CountDoofus> I wonder how Deadmau5 can see anything through that mask of his
<ofna01> :O
*ofna01 DOWNLOADS NOW
<Tovler> lowercase D; deadmau5
<Tovler> (ah, it's fun to snipe)
<Saturn> 08,01Snuffsis: well, you're quading, so you're squaring twice, yes?
<ofna01> snipins a good job,mate!
<Kammerjunk> Tovler: Deadmau5's official site says "Deadmau5".
<Kammerjunk> ...Once.
<Kammerjunk> I'm really confused, actually.
<Saturn> 08,01so it's (13 sqrt(x)) * (13 sqrt(x)) * (13 sqrt(x)) * (13 sqrt(x))
<Snuffsis> No, i'm only squaring once. I guess it's my fault for directly translating fro mswedish to english. xD
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3LPmA5tk2U&feature=related
<Saturn> 08,01so that's then: (13 ^ 2 sqrt^2(x)) * (13 ^ 2 sqrt^2(x))
<BronyinJapan> ofna01 have you seen the extented intro?
<CountDoofus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxzUmD-BjBA
<ofna01> WHAT
<Saturn> 08,01and those sqrts are cancelled out
<valoreins> gtg guys :D
<valoreins> cya
<BronyinJapan> Here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4By8YHOnILo
<Jim> cya valoreins
<Kwaklad1> Bye valoriens
<Saturn> 08,01so: (13 ^ 2 . x) * (13 ^ 2 . x)
<Saturn> 08,01following the rule of multiplying indices, this becomes: 13 ^ 4 . x ^ 2
<Snuffsis> the whole thing is 13sqrtx=x+36 so i was then going to square it, so it becomes 13^2x=(x+36)^2. But not sure if it's 13^2x or 13x^2. :P
<ofna01> loving it so far brony
<Tovler> I'm only now looking at the new Korra trailer.
<BronyinJapan> Dont you use your fancy mathmentics
<Saturn> 08,01Snuffsis: if you square it, it becomes 13 ^ 2 x
<Snuffsis> Okay, great. :P
<Saturn> 08,01but you asked for quadding, so i did it agin :P
<Phase4> damnit linux! y u no hibernate
<ofna01> WOOHOO!
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: broken kernel?
<Snuffsis> Yea, well it's called "Kvadrering" in swedish, which, when directly translated becomes quadrating or something like that.
<ofna01> THAT WAS AWESOME
<Phase4> kernels fine
<RoboGerbil> cuz you dont have the right power settings
<Phase4> it just wont hibernate
<RoboGerbil> make sure your bios is set for s4
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<BronyinJapan> Phase4 has no food to store for the winter
<Phase4> hibernates in windows so i assume bios is ok
<Phase4> lawl BronyinJapan
<RoboGerbil> did you change hardware since you installed linux?
<Saturn> 08,01but yeah, squaring both sides of that gives (13^2)x = x^2 + 36^2
<Phase4> Saturn: what happens is it does the hibernate, then immedietly exits and screen remains black, seems the nvidia driver is broken
<Saturn> 08,01you can then rearrange that and solve for x by factorising
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: aye, that's almost certianly it
<CountDoofus> when season 2 is over, I plan to download every song from both seasons, burn them on a cd, and have the best back-and-forth trips to work EVER
<Jim> Awesome!
<Snuffsis> Yea, i've gotten ti to be, so far, x^2 + 71x + 1127, now going drag out x from there with the PQ formula. :P
<ofna01> WHY DID THEY CHANGE DERPYS EYES AND VOICE
*ofna01 pulls out shotgun and cocks it
<ofna01> WHO DID IT
<CountDoofus> cause a small minority of people got offended, wah wah wah
<BronyinJapan> we sholud all do that

<ofna01> DERPY
<ofna01> D::::
<Tovler> This is worse than the time they tried to get rid of Speedy Gonzales.
<CountDoofus> breaks your heart, doesn't it :'(
<ofna01> god,thats sad
<ofna01> i literally feel like my heart was hit with a hammer
<Jim> CountDoofus: This version of this made me cry like a bitch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
<Tovler> >mfw they originally got rid of Brock because Japan thought he might be offensive to Asian Americans
<CountDoofus> OH GOD DEAD ISLAND MUSIC
<ofna01> GOD DAMNIT
<ofna01> your making me fucking cry
<Snuffsis> lol
<ofna01> dead island music always makes me tear up
<Snuffsis> Fuck ,this assignment is fucking me over... whatever i do i get the wrong numbers. <.<
<CountDoofus> my throat is clogging up... excuse me, I need a moment...
<ofna01> same here count
<Tovler> you should use Drain-O
<Snuffsis> Aww crybabies*watches clip* hold on, i got sometihng in my eye, brb...
<emangamer> got some time before class to kill
<ofna01> i just wanna hug her
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
<Snuffsis> i wonder who it is that makes that voice though
<Jim> more derpy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obdLhRTfDFo&feature=related
<CountDoofus> snuffsis: the original voice, or the new one?
<emangamer> whats up guys
<Snuffsis> the one in Save Derpy
<CountDoofus> ah
<ofna01> this eman
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
<emangamer> cant
<emangamer> on phone
<ofna01> :(
<Jim> It's that Derpy's appology video
<Twi_Fi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWG0KLSJi8g&feature=related
<Jim> I love that video Twi_Fi
<emangamer> I still havent seen ANYTHING
<emangamer> to prove that derpy is gone
<ofna01> sorry eman
<ofna01> they edited her name out of last roundup
<emangamer> as far as Im concerned
<emangamer> its all speculatio
<ofna01> they got rid of dash calling her derpy
<emangamer> and?
<ofna01> they un-derped her eyes
<emangamer> that doesnt make her dead
<ofna01> changed her voic
<Snuffsis> Well, the derpy we've come to love is gone, and thats what matters.
<ofna01> what he said
<emangamer> she could still be in future episodes
<emangamer> NO SHES NOT
<Tovler> well, she officially demoted to background character.
<ofna01> if they get rid of her like that,she's not coming back
<Ingwaz> Snuffsis: that is not true and by going around saying that you are only stressing other people
<emangamer> NO SHES NOT
<ofna01> any proof?
<Ingwaz> we have yet to receive any official word on it, and studio b has said that in future episodes, she will be fine
<emangamer> you do realize that derpy was origionally NOT derpy
<ofna01> we have plenty of proof supporting she's gone
<Jim> In my opinion, even if they make her not canon, she's still Derpy for us
<emangamer> ofna01, like what
<Ingwaz> really? you have one video thats been changed, which could have been caused by various reasons
<Ingwaz> what else you got?
<xcanox> I think Derpy didn't need to be canon in the first place.
<ofna01> basically,their flipping a finger at bronies
<emangamer> you cant say thr
<emangamer> that
<Ingwaz> even if they had to change her, it is not hasbro's fault
<emangamer> people are overreacting
<xcanox> Ingwaz: lol It's butthurt soccer moms' faults.
<ofna01> they knew we loved Depy,got rid of her,just like that
<Ingwaz> its the people who complained about its fault
<emangamer> Ingwaz, thankyou i couldnt agree more
<Snuffsis> Ingwaz: Well, i can say that simply because the derpy i love is the one they actually called derpy and that had that silly, but perfect voice and messed up rainbow dashs work.
<emangamer> ofna01, your overreacting
<xcanox> Next you'll be saying "Death to butthurt soccer moms!"
<Phase4> ohai emangamer and Ingwaz and xcanox
<emangamer> i gotta go
<Phase4> later emangamer
<Ingwaz> yo Phase4
<emangamer> byr Phase4
<ofna01> alright eman
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
<Jim> cya emangamer
<ofna01> i dare you to watch through that without tearing up
<Tovler> I'm just upset that these people reporting Derpy to Hasbro are invisible.
<Ingwaz> Snuffsis: theres the possibility that only the itunes ep was changed, not the tv episodes, theres also the possibility that they were just changing her voice from the more masculine to the more feminine and left our her name because people were making such a huge fuss over it either way
<Ingwaz> she is not gone, there is no proof of that yet
<CountDoofus> I think this girl has the right idea: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g8yclJPt4I&feature=endscreen&NR=1
<xcanox> Well why not just stop watch ponies altogether? I mean if one pony, who only officially appeared once, being changed upsets you so much, wouldn't it make sense to ragequit?
<Tovler> Soccer Mom, random litigious fucks, mental-health advocates, we don't know who complained.
<Snuffsis> Ingwaz: The voice is what made derpy truly alive for me, it was a perfect fit for the character, even if it wasn't exactly "feminine" But neither is rainbow dashs voice.
<xcanox> RD sounds like a tenor male.
<Twi_Fi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vMPgnUC_9A&feature=g-logo&context=G2c82404FOAAAAAAAHAA
<Tovler> Now I want a Snails episode just to see what happens.
<Ingwaz> i agree in that i liked the voice as well, but going around saying that shes gone forever will only further incite panic
<xcanox> lol Nothing will happen, because Snails is a male.
<xcanox> Nobody gives a crap about males. x)
<Tovler> Males being called retarded need to just suck it up.
<xcanox> To some degree.
<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEqL4vVvii8&feature=endscreen&NR=1
<Tovler> I didn't know that Tranny was a slur.
<Snuffsis> Well, the funny stuff is that, those who are "offended" aren't even the ones being offended.
<xcanox> ^
<CountDoofus> Let's ask Timmy from South Park. Timmy, what do you think about all this? "TIMMEH! Ti-Ti-Timmeh!" Thanks, Timmy.
<Kwaklad1> CountDoofus get jimmy's opinion too
<CountDoofus> Jimmy? "Wh-what Timmy sed."
<Tovler> yeah, but Timmy and Jimmy weren't seen as a nuisance.
<Tovler> (uh-oh, I'm sympathizing with the haters)
<Ingwaz> i'm sure that there were some people with physical differences who were offended by it. However, they are indeed a vocal minority and I grow quite tired of political correctness. But, we must still remain calm and present our case respectfully, otherwise we will only be shut out
<CountDoofus> but they were also depicted as physically and/or mentally disabled
<Kwaklad1> Ingwaz it is politically incorrect to hide them and discriminate, so Derpy and 'retards' should be more visible
<xcanox> What I like is, Derpy made moralgags butthurt, and now moralfags are making bronies butthurt. Who will the bronies make butthurt?
<Kwaklad1> Or did I misunderstand your statement?
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk&feature=related
<Tovler> CountDoofus: And nothing more.
<ofna01> EVERYONE
<ofna01> just be quiet,and listen
<xcanox> I know who the bronies should make butthurt, we should kill peoples' children. :D
<Tovler> It would be like complaining a Zecora simply for being black.
<ofna01> GUYS
<CountDoofus> like that girl said in the video I linked: this is still a kids show at heart, and the voices of the parents are louder than the voices of the bronies. If Hasbro keeps giving in to the bronies, that's going to cause more problems than solve them
<ofna01> ENOUGH
<Ingwaz> Kwaklad1: it could be argued that its politically incorrect either way. you're insensitive if you do portray that character, and you're insensitive if you remove that character
<CountDoofus> and I'm done
<xcanox> Ingwaz: Which is why Derpy didn't need to be canon.
<xcanox> I was satisfied with her as a background character.
<Ingwaz> ofna01: dont you think its kind of hypocritical to post a save derpy video then come here and shout at us for discussing it calmly?
<Kwaklad1> Ingwaz send me an email at KwakLad@derpymail.org I will show you something once I get home
<ofna01> im tired of the walls of text
<Tovler> Derpy should have another chance to make up for Dropping piano's on twilight's head, ruining Apple-bobbing, and destroying town hall.
<Tovler> heh, *pianos*
<Kammerjunk> I still think Derpy should just have a permanent G Major voice.
<Ingwaz> well, i'm tired of seeing all the save derpy videos, seen them all already, that one multiple times as i believe you have posted it multiple times, i'm not shouting at you though
<Kammerjunk> I can't believe I'm the only one who thinks so.
<Snuffsis> I believe so as wel Kammerjunk.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, good.
<Ingwaz> Kammerjunk: i prefer her original voice to the new one, not only is the new one completely out of time but i just feel the deeper one suited her better
<Kwaklad1> Ingwaz no no its not a video
<Twi_Fi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bZVjqcwjQI&feature=related
<Ingwaz> -.- Kwaklad1 i was talking to ofna01
<Kwaklad1> Ohh my bad
<Kammerjunk> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuzjjqX_ndc
<Kammerjunk> See, like that.
<Snuffsis> Caboose!!
<Kwaklad1> Am slow and missed it
<ofna01> DEMON DERPY
<Ingwaz> Kammerjunk: no creepy stuff
<Ingwaz> DO NOT WANT
<Kammerjunk> D:
<ofna01> CABOOSE WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THAT?!?!
<ofna01> Sorry,Sorry!
<CountDoofus> well, time for something less depressing. *puts on Flim Flam Brothers song*
<Ingwaz> that song is addictive
<Pinkieruler124> Hi
<CountDoofus> ello Pinkieruler
<Jim> hi Pinkieruler124

<Tovler> Flim Flam Bros. Song > Smile Song
<ofna01> wrong link
<CountDoofus> only yesterday did I finally manage not to flail my tongue when saying "Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000"
<Snuffsis> Tovler, the sign is going the other way, it's < you're lookin or
<ofna01> Count
<ofna01> i did it perfect the first time
<Tovler> I'm not glad you brought that up, my dear. I say i'm not glad your brought that up.
<RoboGerbil> Its a european ad, it doesnt make a difference http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29_ny2U0vnw
<Pinkieruler124> Well i hate flim and flam
<Phase4> Gah, this should not be so hard
<CountDoofus> well I got a small speech impediment, so it's somewhat harder for me
<Snuffsis> Hmm, i wonder though
<Tarku> goodmorning :)
<Jim> ohai Tarku
<Snuffsis> What is in that cider, drugs?
<Tarku> ohai Jim
<Snuffsis> the way they're shouting for it...
<ofna01> http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=savederpy#/d4qz8e8
<Pinkieruler124> Eyup
<Pinkieruler124> 04 days!!!!
<Tovler> I can actually sing the Flim Flam Bros song and do it justice. (sexism, ftw)
<Snuffsis> Make youtube video
<Snuffsis> and prove it
<Pinkieruler124> That song....
<ofna01> You say I'm overreacting, but you would tooIf a loved one was given, then taken away from youI shed these tears, every drop a memoryNostalgia rolls in, heaven becomes the deepYou didn't like the way she was,So you changed everything
<LunaTheBeloved> Morning everypony
<Tovler> damn, that song is hard to sing without gettin tongue tied.
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHz5-vfMlL8&feature=related
<ofna01> read the lyrics..
<Snuffsis> Tovler, flim flam song?
<Snuffsis> non pa-what?
<CountDoofus> nonpareil, and that's exactly the reason why you see
<Pinkieruler124> I Dont want to sing that song
<Phase4> any linux guru's in here? prefferably someone with a large beard
<CountDoofus> *looks up the meaning of the word nonpareil*
<Phase4> CountDoofus: dat tangential learning
<Snuffsis> what does non pareil mean?
<RoboGerbil> epic luna http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXUzM4bSSUI
<CountDoofus> french for "without equal", apparently
<Snuffsis> aah
<Snuffsis> it makes sense
<Tovler> but aren't the brothers equals?
<Snuffsis> it is similar to "not on par"
<CountDoofus> Phase: sorry, Starswirl the Bearded used Windows
<Snuffsis> non par = not on par get it?
<Snuffsis> xD
<CountDoofus> (sorry for the lame pun)
<Snuffsis> The brothers are equal, but they are without equals
<Snuffsis> No one is on par with their stuff.
<CountDoofus> they're nonpareil as travelling salesponies then
<Tovler> I bet the Koch Brothers could take them out (no-politics)
<CountDoofus> or Mario Bros.
<Pinkieruler124> Mario bros....
<Tovler> Luigi drags the Mario Bros down
<CountDoofus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6eyUO66S_g&feature=related this scene... I laugh each and every time
<Snuffsis> ugh, i don't want to draw graphs
<ofna01> :|
<ofna01> rofl
<herp-a-derp> that scene, describes my entire love life
<ofna01> good scene Count
<Kammerjunk> My personal headcanon is that Starswirl was a mare.
<Snuffsis> i'm supposed to draw y1= 13 sqrt x
<ofna01> i have made my girlfriend a brony
<Kammerjunk> And that she was called Starswirl the Bearded because she invented #25.
<ofna01> round of applause for me?
<Snuffsis> OH COME ONE!
<Kammerjunk> Good on ya.
<CountDoofus> Good job, mate.
<Pinkieruler124> Oh...My....
<Tovler> "That's an appletree" makes me laugh.
<Jim> Spell 25 is best spell
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bpVv9j4ppM&feature=related
<Kammerjunk> I know, I know, Starswirl was called the "father of the antropomorphic spell," but it's MY HEADCANON, DAMMIT.
<Kammerjunk> I pay the bills around here, I can talk about the control group ALL DAMN DAY.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Wrek.

<ofna01> WATCH THIS NOW
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello Tovler
<ofna01> only wrek guys
<ofna01> noone else
<Kammerjunk> Pinkieruler124: Making sense? What fun is there in making sense?
<Jim> G3.5 is best nightmare fuel
<derpy_at_work> Did anypony see tge newsletter?
<derpy_at_work> The*
<Tovler> G3.5 made me laugh when Pinkie Pie said, I can speak in pink.
<Kammerjunk> I don't get the newsletter.
<Kammerjunk> Probably because I'm an idiot.
<Jim> I haven't gotten it yet
<Pinkieruler124> Well all those werid things happening and RD always dresses in style
<Ingwaz> my stomach is not happy with me today
<ofna01> i just dont know what went wrong.....
<Kammerjunk> My entire body is not happy with me today.
<CountDoofus> well, what did you put in there?
<ofna01> oh hasbro,tell us,what went wrong?
<Pinkieruler124> And no she doesnt dresses in style
<Kammerjunk> Pinkieruler124: Rainbow Dash did dress in style.
<Snuffsis> Rainbow Dash always dress in style
<Kammerjunk> But she doesn't do it always.
<Snuffsis> 20% cooler
<Pinkieruler124> G3.5 needs to be 100% cooler
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTcyb3CG4XI dis pear, so delicious
<Jim> 100% of 0 is still 0%
<Kammerjunk> Does not compute.
<ofna01> if hasbro brings back derpy,i will buy everyone here a shirt
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, what Jim said.
<Tovler> and that one lady dragon in the G3.5 christmas special was perky and funny.
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: You don't have the dosh.
<ofna01> i do
<Pinkieruler124> Yea derpy needs to come back...
<Kammerjunk> Shipping a shirt from the US to here costs about 50 bucks alone.
<ofna01> i will make them myself,with a picture of your favorite pony on the front
<herp-a-derp> lol snuffsis
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Tovler> and there was this one good song, but I think it was from G3
<Ingwaz> crap Kammerjunk where do you live?
<Jim> Shipping is so expensive it's not even funny
<Kammerjunk> Wait, I probably phrased that wrong.
<Kammerjunk> A shirt from WeLoveFine costs about 50 bucks, shipping included.
<Tovler> Shipping is indeed expensive with gas prices as they are.
<ofna01> i will make them KAmmer
<Snuffsis> dat shipping: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2KUEc0zXTU
<Ingwaz> where do you live kammer?
<Kammerjunk> You remind me of Misha, ofna01.
<ofna01> whodat?
<Kammerjunk> Ingwaz: Denmark.
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: A Swedish guy who gave me a shirt with Luna's cutie mark just because.
<ofna01> :/
<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
<ofna01> i dont blame derpy
<ofna01> :(
<Kammerjunk> It wasn't his size, so instead of, you know, selling it or something, he gave it away.
<Tovler> Shipping and gas is so high that it's cheaper to reopen factories in America and pay employees a reasonable wage than to fly and ship stuff to china.
<Ingwaz> flash died on me...
<Ingwaz> and that sucks for you Kammerjunk
<herp-a-derp> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFZD8YWhGg0
<Kammerjunk> It does. Costed me 100 bucks to get two shirts.
<Kammerjunk> Worth every penny, of course.
<ofna01> costed Xd
<Kammerjunk> ...I didn't just say costed, did I+
<Kammerjunk> ?*
<Ingwaz> ouch? i'm surprised its so much even though you ordered 2
<ofna01> yep
<Pinkieruler124> Sorry somthing happend
<Kammerjunk> Good Luna, that's embarrassing.
<Tovler> haha, Kammerjunk speaks more than one language
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy1pQE3xsOc
<ofna01> [09:58:28] <Kammerjunk> It does. Costed me 100 bucks to get two shirts.
<DaringDude> dat Bronystate
<Dark__Horst> i forgive you, kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> That is so embarrassing.
<Ingwaz> Kammerjunk has been practicing his derpenese
*ofna01 starts humming dead island theme
<Kammerjunk> And I usually correct my cousin when he uses the semicolon wrong.
<Jim> How does; one use silly colon wrong?
<Snuffsis> Kammerjunk 100bucks for two shirts, where the hell from?!
<Kammerjunk> ._.
<Ingwaz> s'alright Kammerjunk, we all make speech derps. I find myself saying the wrong thing far more often then i would care for
<Pinkieruler124> I Think i saw derpy in super sqezzey 5000
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: From WeLoveFine.
<Kammerjunk> It's the Pacific, you know.
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzcOcBb_ms
<Ingwaz> Pinkieruler124: shes there
<Snuffsis> That is expensive, use redbubble.com instead, they're much cheaper. :P
<Kwaklad1> Kammerjunk try redbubble, they are based in the UK so are probably cheaper shipping
<Kammerjunk> I actually saw a Dark Side of the Rainboom shirt recently.
<Kammerjunk> Shame it was also in the US.
<Pinkieruler124> When RD says i dbout that derpy is there
<Ingwaz> Pinkieruler124: yeah we already know, she also makes an appearance in the snow globe in the most recent episode
<Pinkieruler124> Ok
<CountDoofus> ah geez, I just laughed my ass off with the "bronies react to teens react to MLP", and now DI music again? *sadface*
<Kammerjunk> I fell asleep when Wrek was playing Deus Ex, did he finish the game?
<ofna01> dead island music makes me cry
<Tovler> and she was with Dr. Whooves in H&HD with her eyes still derped.
<Jim> He finished it, yes Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Aww.
*ofna01 hums along with dead island theme playing in his other tab
<Kwaklad1> Kammerjunk I missed him finish it too
<CountDoofus> ofna01: same here
<Kammerjunk> That reminds me, maybe I should close some of the 130-something bucking tabs I have open.

<Dark__Horst> they made her sound plain and someone-that-is-not-derpy
<Pinkieruler124> Uggg
<Dark__Horst> nice wall ya got there, fella
<Tovler> that pic's a bit too lavender.
<Coolbluemidnite> too blue
<Tovler> yeah, she has Dinky's colors in that speed draw.
<ofna01> will derpy at least still be a backround pony at least?
<ofna01> please hasbro?
<Dark__Horst> ^probably. but i doubt she'll ever speak again
<Pinkieruler124> ....
<Dark__Horst> which makes me want to hurt things
<Tovler> Anything could happen in Season 3.
<ofna01> i just dont know what went wrong...
<Pinkieruler124> Eyup!
<Tovler> Season 2, it would be way too much effort to alter any derpy cameos at this point.
<Pinkieruler124> Season 3 im going to love the first ep
<Pinkieruler124> When mlp ends....What is going to happen?
<Snuffsis> So, we're back on the derpy stuff again?
<Dark__Horst> you know what we need? an art initiative. tons of art. shit-tons of art. derpy art. derpy art like that save derpy vid. assloads of that
<Tovler> Maybe we can form brony conclaves while we all watch Korra.
<Dark__Horst> the people working on the show do browse the community and that would be an effective way to tell them waht we think without shouting in their faces
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObPtGVcV1DA&feature=related
<ofna01> like this?
<Tovler> watching those hens hypnotizes me.
<Snuffsis> The best thing to do would be to educate the regular crowd of morons from being morons and thinking everything is insulting and not politically correct
<Snuffsis> Would someone please thinkg of the children?!
<herp-a-derp> honestly, the only way to get derpy hooves back as canon would to be to rid the world of the politicly correct
<CountDoofus> maybe I should make a drawing of Derpy reacting to the whole situation... I can imagine her sitting in front of a computer, laughing her [yay] off
<Tovler> 21/1/12 never forget.
<ofna01> Count
<CountDoofus> aye?
<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0
<ofna01> instead of her laughing,she should be sad
<Tovler> and I applauded this show for daring to acknowledge blacks and native americans.
<Snuffsis> blacks?
<Dark__Horst> i'm afraid the black and native references completely flew over the heads of the dipshits that screamed at derpy
<Tovler> I wonder if mexicans in the MLP world are White-tailed deer

<Pinkieruler124> i tunes did all this
<ofna01> hasbro did it too
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I just wanted to blame the Pegasi.
<ofna01> they has to reanimate the scenes she was in
<ofna01> had*
<Tovler> So, the complainers went directly to iTunes.
<ofna01> i guess
<Pinkieruler124> they sholdnt have MLP there in the first place!
<Tovler> But podcasters can't even get ahold of iTunes
<derpy_at_lunch> Oh shit i just remembered
<ofna01> Friends. We are gathered here today, as you are all aware, to pay our last tributes and respects﻿ to the memory of our departed friend, Derpy Hooves. When this video first aired fans rejoiced at her voice the lord has given her. Now we mourn her death out of censorship orgonizations that have killed joy across our nation; 4kids, SOPA, FCC, and now this.
<Cypresswolf> Im going to check something...be right back
<sharklion> need to get good heaphones, brb
<Pinkieruler124> SOPA 4KIDS FCC DID ALL THIS!?
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: I think you're forgetting a very important bill, seeing how SOPA and PIPA were "ultimately shelved".
<ofna01> join me........in saluting CAPTAIN DERPY HOOVES! *jets fly over*
<Saske909090> GUYS IS THIS LIVE
<ofna01> i didnt make that kammer
<Kammerjunk> Aha.
<ofna01> copied from a youtube vid
<ofna01> except for the last part
<Tovler> On January 24, 2012 4Kids Entertainment's Toonzai site reported via its Facebook page that traffic to the site has risen 20%, in the days following the United States government's closure of the Megaupload file-sharing service.
<Tovler> but, I'm always mad at 4kids, so w/e
<derpy_at_lunch> OH SHIT Johnjoseco opened commisions today i completly forgot
<sharklion> ACTA is happening in europe
<ofna01> cant believe they closed Megaupload
<Pinkieruler124> Ohh i tunes if it wasnt for you this wouldnt be happening
<sharklion> and they're planning on blocking pirate bay to those in UK
<Kammerjunk> sharklion: http://xkcd.com/1022/
<Kammerjunk> Whoops.
<Kammerjunk> Wrong link.
<Kammerjunk> http://www.ustr.gov/acta
<Pinkieruler124> Sopa needs to go
<sharklion> still relevant
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ERSVtU571k
<ofna01> R.I.P Derpy
<CloudSabre> who in here disagrees with derpy getting removed?
<Kammerjunk> >The United States, Australia, Canada, Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Morocco, and Singapore signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) at a ceremony on October 1, 2011, in Tokyo
<sharklion> SOPA went, ACTA is it's son out for rewvenge
<ofna01> practiacally every brony on this earth Cloud
<Pinkieruler124> Stop saying derpy is gone...
<derpy_at_lunch> No
<Pinkieruler124> I have her next to me
<Tovler> so, SOPA and PIPA were actually a diversion.
<Kammerjunk> The US have signed ACTA.
<derpy_at_lunch> Acta is sopa on steroids
<Kammerjunk> Or has.
<ofna01> no we havent Kammer
<Pinkieruler124> Derpy is still here
<ofna01> they shelved it
<Kammerjunk> Look at my link.
<Pinkieruler124> I Saw her
<Tovler> I can't wait for the internet to become as crappy as the radio.
<Cypresswolf> Last Roundup will re-air sometime after Wednesday March 7, thats as far ahead as my dish network guide can go atm
<Kammerjunk> It was signed the 1st of October in Tokyo.
<ofna01> i've seen love come,seen it shot down,seen it die in vain
<sharklion> It passed in ireland but not anywhere else I knnow of
<Tovler> Land of the Free indeed
<Cypresswolf> Im still certain its only the itunes version that was changed
<Saturn> 08,01this is great: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pD-gElyNd9ogmTk1cu_4JReAd6O8wqLHW7w05kwTM_Q/edit?hl=en_GB&pli=1

<Saturn> 08,01ofna01: did you break the internet?
<Saturn> 08,01again?
<ofna01> nope
<KwakLad> Kammerjunk: i finally got back to doing this Brony survey thing and notice that one of the questions asks if i "Strongy Agree" with something
<ofna01> lemme try it
<Kammerjunk> KwakLad: Yes?
<ofna01> security problem
*Pinkieruler124 gets mad
<KwakLad> Strongy Agree not strongly
<kirzstryfe> 1,3good afternoon everypony :)
<ofna01> starin down a bullet,let me make my final staaaaand.......
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<KwakLad> good day kirzstryfe
<CountDoofus> good day kirz
<ofna01> afternoon kirz
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, Dr. Psych Ology makes a few typos here and there.
<Pinkieruler124> NOPONY SAYS THINGS ABOUT DERPY!!!
<Kammerjunk> Still an awesome.
<sharklion> good morrow
<Kammerjunk> Pinkieruler124: Things about Derpy.
<KwakLad> Aye
<xcanox> I think Derpy needs a mourning.
<ofna01> sorry pinkie,but she's as good as dead
<Tovler> saying things about Derpy is censored here?
<xcanox> We should mourn Derpy.
<ofna01> aye,xcan
<sharklion> sigh, why does nopony stream through this at the moment!
<ofna01> ill put on music
<Pinkieruler124> Uggg derpy is still here...You just cant spot her well
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfmYCM4CS8o&ob=av3e
<Tovler> Without Derpy, how will survive this election season?
<Kammerjunk> I'd vote for Vermin Supreme.
<Kammerjunk> He wants everyone in the US to have a pony.
<Saturn> 08,01i like derpy's new voice
<sharklion> still no stream
<Saturn> 08,01it sounds like balddumborat
<Kammerjunk> Derpy's new voice sounds like it was voiced by Ashleigh.
<ofna01> voice is fine,but the name censoring is just too far
<Tovler> He needs to change is name to Varmint Supreme.
<sharklion> and didn't they change the eyes?
<Saturn> 08,01well, yeah
<ofna01> its like,HERE'S A COOKIE,OH WAIT,IM GONNA TAKE IT BACK
<Saturn> 08,01not only that, but rainbow dash's lines were delivered so much better in the other take
<Pinkieruler124> Derpy doesnt have her derp eyes your saying?
<Kammerjunk> They were, yeah.
<Tovler> Derpy's new voice sounds too sincere; like she purposefully destroyed Town Hall.
<ofna01> one thing i never got though...
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: More like: Here's a muffin!
<ofna01> why was derpy jumping on a cloud?
<Saturn> 08,01Pinkieruler124: she still derps
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: Because Derpy.
<Pinkieruler124> Ok
<Saturn> 08,01ofna01: for the lulz
<ofna01> yes
<ofna01> at least derpy went out in a blaze of glory
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfmYCM4CS8o&ob=av3e
<derpy_pony> derpy will be best pony forever
*ofna01 Salute's
<Pinkieruler124> How do you put coler on your text

<Kammerjunk> To defeat the Huns.
*Pinkieruler124 walks away
<Kammerjunk> Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?
<ofna01> Pinkies
<ofna01> could you mention that i showed the video to you?
<Tovler> Can Fluttershy save the show from becoming just a cartoon beholden to decency standard this Saturday?
<xcanox> Fluttershy can do anything.
<Kammerjunk> You ponies are acting as if Derpy was the only thing carrying the show.
<xcanox> ^
<ofna01> at least we still have fluttershy
<sharklion> fluttershy will do all things
<xcanox> I watch it for the plot, not Derpy.
<derpy_pony> fluttershy will be next
<Kammerjunk> Until the Last Roundup, Derpy was an easter egg.
<Kammerjunk> You still liked the show back then.
<Pinkies4thWall> ofna01: i'll mention your da if you have one
<Pinkieruler124> It's not called my little derpy
<ofna01> KAmmer,but still,its like,OK WE HEAR YOU GUYs,WE NAMED HER YOUR NICKNAME,OH NEVER MIND
<xcanox> Although I can't argue that My Little Derpy WOULDN'T be epic.
<derpy_pony> the derpy fanfics are epic
<Kammerjunk> You still have to consider that Hasbro's number 1 concern is money.
<Kammerjunk> Despite what Studio B might think.
<Pinkies4thWall> ofna, you have a da?
<ofna01> no
<Pinkieruler124> Look it's not hasbro's falt its i tunes

<Kammerjunk> CuddlyKittens11: Out of the way, it's a busy day, and nothing's on my mind.
<BritishBrony> Illustrator, you better not crash on me now.
<Saturn> 08,01http://saturnspace.deviantart.com/art/Clearly-Visable-284225151
<CuddlyKittens11> Hmm... I've got a few....
<Kammerjunk> "Listen son," said the man with the gun, "there's room for you inside."
<CuddlyKittens11> "I remembwer when we were driving, driving in your car."
<Jim> So awesome Saturn :3
<sharklion> awesome
<Pinkieruler124> What the...Derpy and doc are not in love!
<Tovler|Twibfm> I'm so happy now *looks at the Save Derpy video*
<Jim> Well, Derpy might be like one of the doctors companions
<sharklion> 'we are going down, we are going down.'
<Saturn> 08,01also: http://saturnspace.deviantart.com/art/Pintroducing-Queensland-277213475
<BritishBrony> Wow.
<CountDoofus> your dA, Saturn?
<sharklion> ooohhh! it's you!
<ofna01> http://derpy.me/nV0PV
<CuddlyKittens11> Saturn: are those your works?
<Kammerjunk> I really need to find a place to buy an ushanka.
<sharklion> I saw that ages ago and forgot your name!
<Pinkieruler124> Nooooo
<sharklion> #sorry about that

<BritishBrony> Mah laptawp is too slow...
<Pinkieruler124> 4th?
<Saturn> 08,01i totally did.
<Saturn> 08,01(i wish)
<CuddlyKittens11> Saturn: wait, they are your works or they aren't? (I R Confused)
<Saturn> 08,01unfortunately, a dyspraxic sloth with a crayon could draw better than me
<Saturn> 08,01they're not
<Pinkieruler124> Pinkie4th?
<CuddlyKittens11> Ah, ok.
<CuddlyKittens11> I need to get into digital painting and comics.
<CuddlyKittens11> I can do fine art.
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, it's been demonstrated that elephants can draw better than i can
<CountDoofus> aaw, that's so nice of you to say. thanks for the compliment :$
<CuddlyKittens11> wanna see my latest wokr?
<KwakLad> Saturn isnt dispraxia the numbers only form of dislexia?
<Tovler|Twibfm> Roz Ryan should have voiced Derpy.
<BritishBrony> I might have another late night tonight... I'm too energetic to sleep.
<CountDoofus> Hit us Cuddly
<CuddlyKittens11> http://fav.me/d4r03ee
<Saturn> 08,01KwakLad: that's dyscalculaia
<CuddlyKittens11> Was working on it during the Friday stream.
<Saturn> 08,01or however it's spelled
*Pinkies4thWall has S2 Luna on screen; is all "SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
<CountDoofus> ... wow
<CuddlyKittens11> (posted a few preview pics here)
<Saturn> 08,01dyspraxia is a disorder of motor planning
<Saturn> 08,01from the latin praxis, meaning to plan
<KwakLad> Saturn i have been wronged then, now to find my righting hammer!
<Saturn> 08,01or somethign along those lines
<Saturn> 08,01an elephant drew this: http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/20/article-1151283-0395826B000005DC-632_233x357.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01it's better than i could do
<CuddlyKittens11> Saturn: Eh, it takes A LOT of practice to get good with art.
<Pinkieruler124> I Have the cmc on my desktop P:
<CuddlyKittens11> It's also partially about finding a style that you're confertable with, as well as a medium
<CuddlyKittens11> comfortable*
<sharklion> I have trixie on my desktop
<BritishBrony> I have Derpy.
<CuddlyKittens11> I have Vinyl on my desktop.
<xcanox> I have a black screen on my desktop.
<BritishBrony> ...
<CuddlyKittens11> (Used to be Filly rarity yelling at a rock)
<Pinkieruler124> LOL!
<Tovler|Twibfm> I have Luna, Luna, and… whoa 3 Lunas on my desktops
<CountDoofus> people tell me my drawings looks great, while I think they're fugly
<Jim> Oh my http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TcddoSCB8I&feature=related :o
<KwakLad> i have a foal twilight on my desktop atm
<BritishBrony> Jim: Holy...
<Tovler|Twibfm> The odds of my have the same 3 desktops is fairly low
<Saturn> 08,01CuddlyKittens11: you're like the millionth person to say this to me. trust me, hun, i've tried.
<sharklion> wow
<Saturn> 08,01i'll just stick to writing music
<TrixieMuffin> Heres a definition of art : if you give a mokey a crayon , he will eat it , if you give infinite mokeys crayons , they will eat them , but as infinity goes , an infinite number o them will poop art . So monkey + crayon = art , when in fact its just poop. Stick with what you like , ignore experts!
<CuddlyKittens11> Saturn: Try harder, ;)
<Pinkieruler124> Hold on im going to the main six
<CuddlyKittens11> ConuntDoofus: Can I ask whay type of style you're trying to do?
<CountDoofus> this is my background atm http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/21631?search=ponies_the_anthology
<Saturn> 08,01CuddlyKittens11: but then what if i task you with writing a symphony? does your argument still hold up then?
<Tovler|Twibfm> >mfw that random long-haired grey pegasus in McDonalds becomes the new Derpy.
<KwakLad> Jim, that is one awesome luna, did you have some part in it?
<sharklion> Saturn's picture is now my desktop. and the saturn was a desktop
<Saturn> 08,01people who say you just need to practice art to be good at it take their natural talent for granted
<Jim> I had no part in it, I just found the video
<Pinkieruler124> And sprinkles
<CuddlyKittens11> Saturn: I never had a natural Talent for art before.
<sharklion> cya, got food to eat
<BritishBrony> Bye sharklion
<CuddlyKittens11> Saturn: I used to be one of the worst in the class.
<sharklion> never felt more loved
<CountDoofus> CuddlyKittens11: I've just taken my first steps of drawing at the beginning of this month. so far, it's all hand-drawn, using vectors as reference points
<BritishBrony> I'm better at writing Novels then art myself.
<Saturn> 08,01CuddlyKittens11: i can listen to a piece of music, pick out the melodies and harmonies and play them on the piano off the cuff. is this just a case of practice, or is it natural talent?
<Saturn> 08,01i'd argue a bit of both
<CuddlyKittens11> CoutDoofus: they are much better than most people I've seen to start drawing. Does your school offer art classes?
<Pinkieruler124> I Dont have it i was just messing around
<Saturn> 08,01but without the talent, there's only so much that practice will do
<CountDoofus> I'm not in school anymore... I'm 27 :p
<kenne88> did everyone stop talking or something?
<BritishBrony> Ee-nope.
<Big> o hai
<ScootaChicken> Saturn: I remember attending a really interesting talk about the whole talent vs practice thing
<CuddlyKittens11> CountDoofus: Oh, lol. Local Community College offer art classes?
<Big> sooo what exactly is this???
<ScootaChicken> essentially, it was saying the opposite of what you are
<Big> is this a stream or summit???
<ScootaChicken> natural talent, if it even exists, can only really get you so far
<TrixieMuffin> Im going shopping , again , anypony know how to ake PMVs ? or even does them on request ?
<Pinkieruler124> Im good at drawing just still in 4th...
<Jim> Big, there's no stream at the moment
<CountDoofus> eh, haven't really checked. not sure if drawing is something I plan to keep on doing for years, so might be a waste of money in the end
<ScootaChicken> practice is what makes you good at things, full stop.
<Big> so what exactly is the stream Jim?
<Saturn> 08,01ScootaChicken: what was the conclusion?
<CuddlyKittens11> CountDoofus: Community College courses are Hella-cheap. I think the supplies might be more expensive in the long run.
<kenne88> usually its whatever admins are doing at the time
<Jim> Well, there might be a stream later when someone who can stream gets online
<ScootaChicken> let's take a real world example: Mozart evidently had a lot of musical talent, but the only reason he could compose operas at the age of 10 was because of the stupid amount of practicing he did
<Pinkieruler124> Oh...My...God....
<ScootaChicken> piano was essentially his life, there was practically nothing else.
<Big> yeah but Jim what is the stream actually OF?
<Saturn> 08,01ScootaChicken: this is true
<ScootaChicken> it's quite like all the Asian maths/violin/piano prodigies you always hear about (and my mum wants me to become so I don't bring shame upon the family >.>)
<Jim> Big, sometimes there's TV-shows, animes, games, live pony drawings etc.
<ScootaChicken> it's because their parents/themselves force them to do a ridiculous amount of practicing
<Saturn> 08,01ScootaChicken: i know the feeling... *sigh* asian parents...
<ScootaChicken> and that's what makes them so good
<kenne88> wait...they do anime here?!?!?!? i gotta come here more often
<Pinkieruler124> Scoota!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<ScootaChicken> Saturn: I'm just glad that only one of my parents is Asian
<Big> huh, kay, also Jim um when is the new mlp aired? and where?
<Jim> !cd
<Tom> Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 4 days, 23 hours, 1 minutes, 38 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
<Jim> It's next saturday
<CuddlyKittens11> I've got a German mother, she acts like an asian parent.
<Big> where?
<Saturn> 08,01ScootaChicken: see, that's the thing thouhg. i've worked with, and taught, asian "virtuosos". most of them are actually shit and have no musicality
<Jim> Here
<Big> o
<Saturn> 08,01technically proficient
<Saturn> 08,01sometimes to the extreme
<Saturn> 08,01but that alone doesn't make a great, or even good, musician
<ScootaChicken> exactly.
<Jim> The friday stream which is counting down up there is a movie night where we see two movies and two old MLP episodes
<kenne88> Big: if you watch it here its here if you mean on tv its on the hub network
<Saturn> 08,01i lack the talent needed to do even basic visual composition
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, hell, i know composition rules and techniques
<ScootaChicken> One can be able to play the solo from Stairway To Heaven in it's entirety, but that just makes them really good at copying notes
<Big> okay is that only in america or summit Jim?
<CountDoofus> Cuddly: I'm also not in the States, so I'll have to look around for art classes. never bothered to look for such, so...
<Saturn> 08,01y'know though, i've never taken any art classes
<Jim> Big, nope the stream is shown everywhere
*Pinkieruler124 walks away
<Saturn> 08,01or really tried hard to better myself at art
<Saturn> 08,01certainly haven't practiced a lot
<CuddlyKittens11> CountDoofus: Oh, ok. That makes things a bit harder. Just go out an buy some books about art. It's what I've been doing lateley.
<Saturn> 08,01maybe i'll give it a go
<Big> i cant wait til the new ep
<CountDoofus> yeah, I've bought one today. have yet to look inside, though :D
<CuddlyKittens11> What's the book called?
*Pinkieruler124 Jumps around
<CountDoofus> oh you wouldn't know it, it's a local one (in Dutch)
<CuddlyKittens11> Ah.
<CuddlyKittens11> See if you can get one that talks about "The Elements of Art," and "The Principles of Design."
*Pinkieruler124 Stops jumping
<CuddlyKittens11> Chances there are no books titled that, the are conecpts in art.
<CuddlyKittens11> "The elements of Art," are more important than the "Principales of Design," BTW.
<CountDoofus> people have recommended I should get "Keys to Drawing" by Bert Dodson
<Big> hey Jim, what if i miss the new mlp, can i just watch it on youtube?
<CuddlyKittens11> CountDoofus: Never heard of that one.
<Jim> The episode will probably be on youtube a while after the new episode have aired, Big.
<CountDoofus> http://books.google.be/books/about/Keys_to_Drawing.html?id=E9AnudWoHRkC&redir_esc=y
<Pinkieruler124> Eyup!
<Pinkies4thWall> ZOMG
<Pinkies4thWall> I LOVE THIS
<Big> hmm... any way i can get it faster Jim???
<Pinkies4thWall> i can move ponies manually!
<CuddlyKittens11> CountDoofus: Okay, I might have seen that one before.
<CountDoofus> heh... I think my latest drawing is going to generate so much hate
<Pinkieruler124> Errmm
<pony_5325> hello
<CuddlyKittens11> You might also want to pick up a book called "Drawing on the Right side of the brain."
<CuddlyKittens11> ConutDoofus: how come?
<CountDoofus> hello, pony_5325
<Jim> Not quite sure, have heard that he episodes are released on iTunes too, but not sure how fast they get up there
<pony_5325> howitgoing?
<Big> kk ill see all u guuys on friday, hopefully
*Pinkieruler124 smile's evily
<Big> byyyye
<pony_5325> bye
<CountDoofus> made a drawing of Derpy standing in front of her own tombstone, her eyes become underped, she starts crying and says "My name is Ditzy Do... and I'm... normal."
<Saturn> 08,01CuddlyKittens11: i had a look into that,a ctually
<Saturn> 08,01apparently, it's a load of bullshit
<Jim> I have a new tune for my alarm clock http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vjA8XrWjSA
<Saturn> 08,01according to a few phsychologists i know
<Pinkieruler124> NOOOOOOOO NOT NORMAL!
<CuddlyKittens11> Saturn: You know that book is about the theory and philosophy of drawing, nothing to do with psychology?
