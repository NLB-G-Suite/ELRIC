<That_One_Brony> well... That was interesting
<Shizuka> 13J_E_Smith71: i'm sure other eps will get voted more
<Kurra> the terms of ghost and shell are meant to be more poetic. You could think of them as physical body and supernatural eternal soul instead
<thelonepony> Hi Kelpow :)

<Shizuka> 13but then you cut your GLORIOUS LOCKS
<dawnmew> 100kb is enough for low-rate 360p. You'll need several megabits for 720 or 1080p.
<SafariMonkey> XAX: same! High five! :P
<Shizuka> 13well, we stream at 640x480
<CrimsonPhoenix> so yeah All night MLP Marathon

<Lunar-geeky> Lunox: hial Luna

<Moopy> John Madden
<AdamTheDuck> Aeiou
<Engi> football
<Engi> Snake?
<Lunar-geeky> ninenineienein

<AdamTheDuck> Brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
<Engi> saaaake
<Moopy> Come over come over come over let eat you
<Lunar-geeky> hial Luna
<MadSurge> No stream :(
<Moopy> nope
<Moopy> I can't wait to play Halo 4
<Engi> I can wait
<DeadpoolDash> is stream ded?
<Engi> I can wait forever
<Engi> DeadpoolDash: No, it's just black and silent
<AdamTheDuck> Nah we're just having a buffer show marathon
<Engi> It's an avant garde video
<Lunar-geeky> so whos with the Lunar Rebuplic
<Engi> probably too obscure for you
<Moopy> I know and its going to be awesome
<thegt90> http://emkay-mlp.deviantart.com/art/United-Equestria-Emblem-291756796
<Lunar-geeky> thegt90: is nutral
<thegt90> nutral with a 357. magnum
<AdamTheDuck> No love for the .22
<Lunar-geeky> thegt90: im for united equstra to under the baner of the grate Luna
<thegt90> u really want to know what i like
<Lunar-geeky> AdamTheDuck: nuthing like a 44 magenum
<Lunar-geeky> thegt90: shuer
<AdamTheDuck> Lunar-geeky, nothing screams manlyness quite like going to war with a pink derringer. http://derpy.me/kv9Dn
<Lunar-geeky> AdamTheDuck: hell ya .... is that realy your gun or some pic you found
<AdamTheDuck> Lunar-geeky, lol nah, gun laws in Australia are very strict.
<Engi> .44 Magnum is horrible for a combat cartridge
<Lunar-geeky> AdamTheDuck: ah
<DeadpoolDash> i really need to buy more guns
<Lunar-geeky> Engi: so it makes big boom and big whols in pepols face
<thegt90> hold on computer being stupid
<Engi> It also has too much recoil, the bullet is too slow, and it doesn't work in pistols.
<Engi> Well, most pistols.
<Engi> The Automag and the Desert Eagle can use it
<Moopy> How about the golden desert eagle gun
<Lunar-geeky> Engi: im taling abut the gun 44 magmun the reover
<Moopy> oh
<thegt90> this is my favorite pony right here http://www.sgtjd.com/73Mustang/Mach%201%20Pictures%20Large/IMG_5503.JPG
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, reminds me of the .50 ae M4 conversion kit.
<Engi> Lunar-geeky: .44 Magnum is a cartridge. There is no firearm simply called "44 magmun"
<DeadpoolDash> .454 is used alot here
<AdamTheDuck> It's just screams: There's no kill quite like overkill
<Engi> .454 Casull is purely for range queens.
<Lunar-geeky> Engi: realy dam well waht the name for the reolver that hulds it
<DeadpoolDash> we have have bears
<Engi> DeadpoolDash: Then use a .45-70 or a .44 Magnum.
<AdamTheDuck> Watch as your IQ slowly burns from the madness .-. http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=AiRrYbte1GI
<Engi> Lunar-geeky: There are thousands.
<Lunar-geeky> Engi: i like revoers
<Engi> AdamTheDuck: You mean .50 Beowulf, right?
<Lunar-geeky> AdamTheDuck: what do you mean my IQ is ardy there
<AdamTheDuck> Can't remember >.< I was just surfing the net one boring afternoon
<DeadpoolDash> have you ever ran into an Alaskan brown bear? You need a large caliber side arm to even have a chance
<AdamTheDuck> Alaskan bull worm
<Engi> DeadpoolDash: What did I *just* say?
<Wrek> 05eye inflammation, sinus inflammation... when will it end...
<Moopy> Hello wrek
*AdamTheDuck licks Wrek .-.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai~
<DeadpoolDash> a 460 is nice since you can fire a 454 and a 45 colt out it as well
<Lunar-geeky> moo
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, maybe an IQ burning video will cheer you up .-. http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=AiRrYbte1GI
<Engi> ...
<Engi> .460 S&W.
<DeadpoolDash> yes
<Engi> When you absolutely positively
<AdamTheDuck> have to punch a 3 inch hole into someone? .-.
<AdamTheDuck> both ends/
<Engi> need to burn over a dollar every time you fire
<DeadpoolDash> I spend over a dollar on ever .308 round i fire anyway
<DeadpoolDash> every
<Engi> .308 is also a rifle cartridge
<Engi> It's arguably worth it
<Wrek> 05.308 isnt very cheap :p
<Engi> Yeah, at least a dollar/round
<AdamTheDuck> Wat. o.o http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWa0kkIRumk

<Phase4> this chat is going over my adsl, which is throttled, over ipv6
<Lunar-geeky> Phase4: lol
<Phase4> however i've changed the default route for ipv4 to the computer in my shed
<Lunar-geeky> brbrbrbrbr
<Jmo> ?+?
<Jmo> >_>*
<Lunar-geeky> b
*AdamTheDuck definately knows what Phase4 is talking about <_<
<Phase4> the computer in my shed has a wifi card and a prety sweet antenna
<Phase4> and my neighbours have poorly secured wifi
<Phase4> :3
<Jmo> You're an ass phase.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh wow Phase4 XD
<Phase4> bah, they're plan has no excess usage charges
<Phase4> and they never use it
<Phase4> like litteraly never
<Jmo> Still not cool >.>
<Phase4> i was checking for activity for over a month
<Phase4> at one point the printer... i think it printed something, hard to tell
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Phase4> but yeah, afaik theres a printer on the network and thats it
*Conscience "Do eeet Phase4, you don't know when you're going to get back your brandwidth"
<Phase4> Jmo, if they didnt want their wifi hacked they should have used wpa
<Jmo> Are they old folks?
<Phase4> Jmo, considering their usage patern of "they dont" thats quite likely
<Jmo> That'd explain it.
<Jmo> If you were cool, you'd let them know that their wifi is non-secure and help them with it :P
<Phase4> Jmo, not sure how though
<Jmo> Maybe they'll bake you cookies or something.
<Phase4> its not like they have computers on their network
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, oh you :$
<Phase4> and remember i have a very good antenna
<Phase4> theres like 15 houses it could be
<Engi> Just keep on stealing it.
<Engi> It's not like anyone cares.
<Phase4> ^

<The_Engineer> AdamTheDuck: I have a question fo yo
<AdamTheDuck> I liek questions \:3/
<AdamTheDuck> Unless they're math questions
<Vivix> 1+1!
<AdamTheDuck> then the multiple choice answers will be a, c, d and c respectively
<AdamTheDuck> and every other short answer question is 42.
*Vivix nods once
<The_Engineer> AdamTheDuck: What time does Bro0nystate run in?
<AdamTheDuck> The_Engineer, umm...
<The_Engineer> I want to put it so I can come watch with everybody.
<Jezebel> >.>
<Jezebel> <.<
<AdamTheDuck> EDT I assume
<The_Engineer> EDT
<Vivix> the bot does UTC0...the place itself is very international-
<The_Engineer> ?
<The_Engineer> I want to se it as my computer time
<Vivix> the mods span most of the time-zones
<The_Engineer> Set*
<The_Engineer> Is it USA?
<AdamTheDuck> The_Engineer, yeah I think
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/na/edt.html
<Vivix> Was it saturn who owned the server? If you go by that it is gmt+1 currently- I think
<The_Engineer> uhh

<Vivix> +0*
*Vivix doesn't know
<The_Engineer> I don't know what GMT
<The_Engineer> is
<AdamTheDuck> Tomorrow on Tuesday @ 7 PM EDT we have Left 4 De
<AdamTheDuck> Announcements are in EDT so I assume EDT.
<Phase4> The_Engineer, its the globally accepted '0'
<Phase4> in terms of time
<The_Engineer> What
<Vivix> Oh yeah that's true adam
<The_Engineer> ...
<Phase4> The_Engineer, well your time zone will be a gmt offset
<The_Engineer> I don't understand GMT
<Vivix> GMT and UTC are the standards, computers usually use GMT as their standard in clocks in windows
<The_Engineer> What does GMT stand for and what does it mean
<Vivix> Greenwich mean time, I think
<Phase4> greenwich meen time
<The_Engineer> ...
<Phase4> something like that
<The_Engineer> What the heck
<AdamTheDuck> Wasn't it meridian time?
<Vivix> if you open your windows clock, it should say your timezone in a gmt + -
<AdamTheDuck> or something
<The_Engineer> Gmt is weird for me
<The_Engineer> Oh there we go
<The_Engineer> UTC+04:00
<AdamTheDuck> No it's Mean, you are right.
<The_Engineer> Mine is UTC +04:00
<Allie> Hello Everypony :D
<Phase4> UTC is about the same thing as GMT
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Allie
<Jmo> Ermagerd
<Jmo> Allie
<Phase4> they're different in ways that dont matter to the average person
<Phase4> ohai Allie

<Vivix> EDT is GMT-4 and EST is GMT-5
<The_Engineer> Can't you just say everybody....
<Phase4> and AEST is GMT+10
<Phase4> +11 during daylight savings
<The_Engineer> So phase

<Vivix> I'm gonna name my kid Norge Norskersen and see how much he loves me when he grows up
<Jezebel> just pulling your leg adamtheduck
<Jezebel> :D

<AdamTheDuck> At least I know the world isn't doomed to the type of music played on the radios nowadays.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/Gtl4oRYlRB8 this was one of my all time fav bands when I was a teenager, only 5k views ;__;
<JRP2234-GAMES> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9n0ui7xJd1rw70wfo1_500.png this was a unused portal file
<Vivix> Haha
<Vivix> oh, still, glad they didn't use it
<Vivix> funny that it was taped on though
<AdamTheDuck> Is that Japanese Vivix?
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> Despite never being an anime fan or things like that- I was, and still am I guess, veery into japanese music
<Vivix> Specifically this genre and the more grungy things-
<AdamTheDuck> When I think Japanese all that comes to mind is all those J-pop songs .-.
<AdamTheDuck> This song is very unexpected
<AdamTheDuck> for me anyway
<Vivix> ah yeah
<Vivix> yeah jpop is very--very pop
<Vivix> I was more into things like this

<AdamTheDuck> Wish I knew what the lyrics translated to ;~;
<Vivix> Hehe yeah, I spent a lot of time reading translations those days
<Vivix> pumpkin head is more of a "just for fun" group though, so most of the times their lyrics made no sense
<Vivix> and INSANE engrish at times
<AdamTheDuck> Engrish is best enligh \:3/
<Vivix> hehehe

<Vivix> Engriish
<Vivix> Anyone's guess what that song is about, but hey, Jet sounded nice
<AdamTheDuck> Still not as bad as Nicki Minaj
<AdamTheDuck> Something more slow from Jet... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD1cxSE25ck
<Vivix> hehe

<Bronysith> "kick logic out and achieve the impossible"
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/c/src/1349921518587.jpg LOOK AT IT, LOOK AT THE CUTE
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/89d19461edb336301a41219f7093765f.png enough with the drunk jokes, Berry Punch is a hard worker :)
<JRP2234-GAMES> Phase4 goto bed

<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/c/src/1349980966637.jpg
<MadSurge> Bronysith: where's that chick from?
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/c/src/1349985262704.jpg
<Bronysith> MadSurge: yuru yuri
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/c/src/1349986144659.jpg
<Lil_B> None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free
<MadSurge> Bronysith: I've heard of that show... not interested :D

<MadSurge> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmF7Rbe89fM only way to watch Yuru Yuri correctly :D
<Lil_B> wow... currently browsing through "Woman Quotes xD" A woman is as old as she looks before breakfast.
<MadSurge> :D
<MadSurge> Lil_B: so Pinkie is still young because she's always hyper?
<Lil_B> well... I think that doesn't mean what the quote was impülying xD
<Lil_B> When thou goest to woman, take thy whip. - Nietzsche
<MadSurge> Nietzsche, ugh
<Lil_B> yeah, good ol Nitesche... reminds me, I need to check out Kant
<MadSurge> Kant is better than Nietzsche, no ubermensch bullshit
<Lil_B> The desire of a man for a woman is not directed at her because she is a human being, but because she is a woman. That she is a human being is of no concern to him.- Immanuel Kant, well basiclly wehat he's saying is "Man can love everything female, doesn't need to be human"
<Lil_B> MadSurge Übermensch bullshit? never heard about that, but I'm actually not that teached about them
<Marx> Alright, just got back from the polls, and I can say I have voted in a presidential election for the first time.
<MadSurge> Lil_B: eh, some men are better than others and they should lead society :|
<Jmo> Did you vote for Vermin Supreme?
<MadSurge> Jmo: what?
<Lil_B> MadSurge oh :/
<Lil_B> Marx have you voted for your Colleque Friedrich?
<Jmo> You don't know him? Tsssk.
<Lil_B> Engels*
<OneTrickPony> imma go to sleep now bai ^_^
<MadSurge> Call them by name, not american nicknames!
<MadSurge> Bye OneTrickPony :)
<Marx> Yeah, that might help.
<Lil_B> bye OneTrickPony !

<Lil_B|RetroCityRampa> almost :/
<Tenderheart> Good Morning.
<SafariMonkey> Morning Tenderheart
<SafariMonkey> :)
<Tenderheart> :3 SafariMonkey
<SafariMonkey> :3
<SafariMonkey> So how's it going Tenderheart?
<Tenderheart> Good, kids are off to school and I'm looking up were I vote for the upcomming election. Listening to some Tomestone, and sippping tea. ^u^
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ded chat? Hai everypony :3
<Tenderheart> Hello, and it appears so.
<Jmo> Nomnomnomnom
<Spell-of-Gaming> My school is showing a screening of Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2
<Spell-of-Gaming> Which apparently is child-friendly
<Tenderheart> Well for thoses that like the series.. good.
<artist> heyheyhey
<NullRadix> Spell-of-Gaming: my condolences
<artist> http://www.artige.no/bilde/42424
<Tenderheart> Ohh a link... *clicks*
<artist> :)
<Jmo> My god.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sometimes I find my school iritating
<Jmo> Biker Mars From Mars.
<Jmo> Mice^
<artist> Spell-of-Gaming: sometimes?
<Jmo> How long it has been since I've watched that.
<artist> how about all the time
<artist> yay jaymoe!
<Tenderheart> I like the sketches at the bottom.
<Spell-of-Gaming> The last time I had my exams, we had to sequence on when the events happen
<SafariMonkey> Sorry disconnect.
<artist> Tenderheart: who would win in a fight between those 3 guys?
<Tenderheart> No worries... WB
<Tenderheart> The Biker Mice?
<artist> no
<artist> between the eastwood and god and pulp fiction guy
<SafariMonkey> Did you say something Tenderheart?
<Tenderheart> It's between Samuel and Morgan but I'm leaning towards Samuel since he wouldn't hesitate.
<Tenderheart> Just this if you missed it:
<Tenderheart> [08:50:04] <Tenderheart> Good, kids are off to school and I'm looking up were I vote for the upcomming election. Listening to some Tomestone, and sippping tea. ^u^
<artist> Tenderheart: morgan would probably win...you know...being god and all
<SafariMonkey> Nice. :)
<Tenderheart> Kinda depends on the terms of the fight
<Tenderheart> Pretty sure God just wouldn;t get involved.
<SafariMonkey> Tea, so are you British?
<SafariMonkey> It's just not as o
<SafariMonkey> * popular in many places
<artist> Tenderheart: yeah, but he is not just god, he's also morgan freeman.
<Tenderheart> No, I'm American.
<artist> http://atomiccircus.deviantart.com/gallery/
<Tenderheart> artist: Hehe.. ture
<Tenderheart> artist: Love the pencil sketches. :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Tea is pretty much stereotypical british-thing.
<artist> me tooooooooooo
<Spell-of-Gaming> Like Professor Layton.
<SafariMonkey> Tenderheart: oh, nice. :) Sorry, didn't mean to be rude, I've just met few tea-drinking americans. :)
<artist> Tenderheart: he's also drawn pewdiepie XD
<Tenderheart> SafariMonkey: No offence taken, I hardly concider myself an atypical American.
<Tenderheart> artist: Saw that... :squee:
<Spell-of-Gaming> I honestly don't know why people think "Love is War", sung by Hatsune Miku, is good.
<artist> Spell-of-Gaming: humans.....
<Spell-of-Gaming> There's hundred of Vocaloid songs out there.
<Spell-of-Gaming> And literally a song with declaring war is popular
<Spell-of-Gaming> And people aren't aware of the meaning of the song.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Deaaaaaaad chat.
<Tenderheart> The masses interpretation is not allways concurrent with that of the artists.
<Tenderheart> I'm multitasking so replys are a tad slow
<artist> shhhhh Tenderheart i'm listening to music here :|
<Tenderheart> *smirks*
<SafariMonkey> Tenderheart you *don't* consider yourself *a*typical?
<SafariMonkey> OK guys I gotta go to the airport
<Spell-of-Gaming> Why?
<SafariMonkey> See ya
<NullRadix> careful out there
<Tenderheart> Have.. fun?
<SafariMonkey> Oh I'm going back to britain
<SafariMonkey> :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Cool.
<Tenderheart> Yay!
<Tenderheart> ... take me with you?
<Tenderheart> hehe
<SafariMonkey> Tenderheart I would but I don't know where you live. :P
<Tenderheart> No wworries. I'll probably be over for BUCK next year.
<SafariMonkey> Tenderheart why?
<Tenderheart> I have a number of friensd over there I need to meet and it's a perfect time to visit.
<MadSurge> Tenderheart: :$ see you there then!
<SafariMonkey> I mean it's not like there aren't cons over here
<Tenderheart> :3
<Tenderheart> TrotCon and Canterlot Gaurdens are in a 2 hours drive from my house so yeah I know.
<Tenderheart> Will be at Brony
<Tenderheart> ..con 2013 as well.
<SafariMonkey> OK bye
<Tenderheart> Bai!
<Tenderheart> *waves*
<artist> WE ARE THE CUTIE-MARK CRUSADERS!
<artist> so quiet here dammit!!!
<Tenderheart> On a quest to find out who we are
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> hello
<Tenderheart> Hi Dishwasher_EXTREME. :)
<naturesfury> so disney maby buying out hasbro. good or bad. what do yall think?
<Tenderheart> ......
<Tenderheart> No...
<Tenderheart> Just... No
<naturesfury> :'(
<NullRadix> consolidation, in general, not so great imo
<naturesfury> but ponies in kingdom hearts guys!!!
<Tenderheart> If they leave it alone.. I'm okay with it.. but I doubt Disney will keep there little paws off.
<Tenderheart> .... okay... that would be cool... but still.
<SpeccyRush> they more or lees left marvel things alone
<naturesfury> + deadpool 2 the game will have pinky pie in it >_> hopfully
<Tenderheart> The part worries me the most is Dinsney lawyers are WAY evil.
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Tenderheart> if they get Hasbro.. that will pretty much all but end BronyCons
<naturesfury> i dont see y they would it wouldstop people from wanting to buy there products. if they cant see that they dont need to be in entertainment buisness
<Tenderheart> They are control freaks. Everything is controled and approved for the "Disney" image. Thing is the Brony image is not compatible with the Disney image I think.. there are parralels but Disney dosn;t Love and Tollerate.
<Ponies47> Morning :3
<Tenderheart> Morning Ponies47
<NullRadix> morning Ponies47
<NullRadix> and generally, what Tenderheart said. Disney operates completely differently
<naturesfury> hmm
<HavokOC> G'day
<Tenderheart> Disney is a business. and they control every aspect of the IP's so they can control the outflow of products and thus the demand and prices for them
<Tenderheart> Hasbro is far more laxed
<Jezebel> I don't understand all the worries about disney
<MadSurge> ^
<Jezebel> disney makes great things
<Tenderheart> Yes they do but they tend to crush independant artists
<naturesfury> ever heard of a great fan made disney thing?
<NullRadix> also arguable: Hasbro straight up didn't expect, and doesn't have experience, controlling their IP like disney does
<Jezebel> remember when they took marvel?
<Jezebel> marvel makes so much money now
<naturesfury> i wonder how much hasbro would be if they sold hmm
<naturesfury> luscus was how much?
<NullRadix> Fun fact: there were several fan-made pony apps on the Android app store for a while there. However, hasbro DMCA'd them shortly before Gameloft announced theirs
<Jezebel> if Disney does acquire hasbro
<Jezebel> hopefully their pony toys improve in quality
<Tenderheart> ^
<NullRadix> so while they're more likely to "leave well enough alone" for most of the fandom, they aren't completely letting the fandom run itself
<spyrofan001> Hello
<Tenderheart> Pixel Toxic and John are licensed by Hasbro.
<Tenderheart> The terms are not that bad from my talks with them
<Jezebel> I'm sure Disney is more after transformers and GI joe than ponies anyway
<Tenderheart> Perhaps, but I still don;t like it.
<Lyra|inbread> safe word is BANANA
<naturesfury> lo lord
<Tenderheart> I prefer Kiwi
<NullRadix> I thought the safe word was chloroform
<naturesfury> rufies
<Tenderheart> ... well that escalated quickly
<naturesfury> lawl
<NullRadix> ... sorry
<Tenderheart> *smirk*
<naturesfury> and btw
<naturesfury> i thought wrek was baned for a month. not hating or anything, just that he was on some yesterday
<NullRadix> banned from *streaming*
<naturesfury> ahhh
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back!
<NullRadix> welcome back Enigma
<Tenderheart> *lurks / AFK*
<MadSurge> :O
<MadSurge> So quiet
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> yes
<NullRadix> yeah... unfortunately there's this thing called "work" I'm technically doing...
<NullRadix> there's little bits of "waiting for computer to do something"
<MadSurge> XD
<Ponies47> O.O

<Dark_Horst> a stream would certainly change that
<MadSurge> Ikr

<derp> that'll be hilarious
<MadSurge> ^
<derp> I saw the video showing their reactions to the royal wedding
<derp> the whole start of the video I was laughing
<MadSurge> Will the site make the numbers of the horsie wedding? :D
<derp> I have no idea.
<derp> I expected the chat to be a bit less slow considering there's like, 20 people
<MadSurge> Best moment was people freaking out over the end of the first part :D
<derp> unless they just stay up there even when they are offline
<MadSurge> Actually yes they do
<derp> Ikr? everyone was like "OMG TWILIGHT IS DEAD"
<derp> the chat went crazy
<NullRadix> Yeah, turnaround on ep1 of wedding was pretty sudden
<NullRadix> suddenly zombies and hellfire
<BaconMane> 0,5Oh god

<Shizuka> 13should keep him out
<BaconMane> 0,5Hah
<BaconMane> 0,5He underestimates your power
<Rev> I'm going to laugh if it fails.
<BaconMane> 0,5POWUH
<rainbowfan> Nuu I missed rainbow's story!
<BaconMane> 0,5ded
<Shizuka> 13hopefully it means everypony is out voting
<fluttercry> 05,15They all went out to vote
<Rev> I didn't.
<Jmo> o_O
<Shizuka> 13GO DO IT
<rainbowfan> I hope they voted for Derpy.
<fluttercry> 05,15Like my history professor said this morning "If you don't vote, you forfit your right to bitch"
<Shizuka> 13^
<rainbowfan> :P
<Shizuka> 13if you don't vote, don't complain
<Rev> I can complain actually
<Rev> Since I'm only 16
<Shizuka> 13get off mah lawn then
<Rev> And don't have control over anything in this election.
<fluttercry> 05,15you damn kids
<fluttercry> 05,15making all that racket
*Alchemist is watching the elections from across the pond
<Shizuka> 13i need it to warm up a little more before i head over, polling place is about a mile away across some dense streets
<Rev> I'm quieter than most adults.
<Shizuka> 13CHANCE OF SNOW... NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
<Shizuka> 13do not want snow .-.
<Rev> It's snowing here.
<Rev> And don't be such a pansy.
<Shizuka> 13i live in minnesota
<Shizuka> 13once snow falls
<Shizuka> 13it won't leave until may
<Rev> I live in WI.
<Shizuka> 13see?
<Shizuka> 13snow won't leave
<fluttercry> 05,15What if you run really really fast?
<Rev> That's why you man up and just fucking go.
<fluttercry> 05,15Rev can you not be a dick please?
<Rev> It's not like you have to wear your wet clothes all day.
<Shizuka> 13not snowing now silly
<Shizuka> 13but snow annoys me because albedo among other things
<Shizuka> 13photic sneeze reflex does not appreciate blinding white outside windows in the morning
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I can't vote for american politics, but I always vote for mine. Those who don't vote don't have the right to complain about politicians imho
<Rev> I'm still going to complain about politicians
<MadSurge> Also hi Shizuka and fluttercry :D
<Vivix> I vote, and still don't complain
<Alchemist> I just found out recently that only every 3rd-5th person has photonic sneeze reflexes. I thought everyone did.
<Vivix> mainly because I have no idea what is going on in our politician world-
<Rev> Photonic sneeze reflexes?
<Shizuka> 13bright light makes you sneeze
<Rev> I don't have that
<Alchemist> Rev: you look into the sun or at a bright light and sneeze.
<Shizuka> 13for me it's usually when i'm brushing out my hair, the tingling from pulling out knots coupled with the light tends to send me into sneezing fits .-.
<MadSurge> Wait, there's that reflex too? O_o The human body is weird sometimes
<Shizuka> 13which is not fun when half awake
<Vivix> I can imagine- ee
<Vivix> I can't sneeze, properly, so I cough-sneeze instead, sometimes that hurts my throat
<MadSurge> Sometimes my palate starts itching for no reason and I end up sneezing my lungs out
<Shizuka> 13the worst is when you know you're going to sneeze from bright light, so you kind of focus on it... and then you don't sneeze
<Shizuka> 13it just kind of hangs there taunting your nose
<Rev> At least you don't have a cleft palate
<Shizuka> 13true that
<MadSurge> Shizuka: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/1f47be399f9ccc6b136a7751b3a73c51.jpg Derpy knows your pain
<Shizuka> 13^
<Shizuka> 13so much that
<Rev> Well, apparently I'm not going to school at all today
<Shizuka> 13it's like COME ON SNEEZE DAMMIT
<Vivix> your luungs hurt because you're preparing, so you sit there with your mouth open and eyes tearing
<Vivix> looking like a complete weirdo-
*Jmo slaps Vivix
<Jmo> CRY.
<Rev> I just hope that my mom doesn't get pissed at me for something I couldn't control
*Vivix dies of tears
<MadSurge> Sometimes I sneeze so powerfully my throat and nose start to hurt out of nowhere :|
<Dark92Enigma> I'm allergic to dust, and that makes me sneeze
<MadSurge> Must be fun >_>
*Dark92Enigma that's why i try to avoid the maid hour, except when i'm wearing a maid suit
<MadSurge> :D
<MadSurge> Last year we had so much snow, it was unprecendented. The roads were so devoid of cars/people you could hear the snow touching the ground! It was eerie
<Vivix> twoo years ago I think, it was so cold I got a brainfreeze while walking outside
<Vivix> snow on forehead and no hat
<Doktor> Hey everybody.
<ekips> ohai #bronystate
<Vivix> hiya

<rainbowfan> an*
<DashWithRainbows> Want ponies?
<Vivix> Yeah, 16:00, just need to stokc up on popcorn
<DashWithRainbows> Here's an idea
<DashWithRainbows> go to youtube...
<Jmo> Give dem ponays.
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: you did.
<Jmo> o u ashie-poo
<Jmo> so helpful
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: tell me more?
<rainbowfan> Alch, i'm saying later today an episode of mlp is gonna be on.
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: here is the ad with outtakes, background etc: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-FM-j8FA0
<Dark92Enigma> rainbowfan: which replay of what episode?
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: so, basically a bunch of bronies said thanks. and that aired?
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: pretty much...yeah...
<Vivix> Its a charity ad, more than anything
<Vivix> foor toys for tots
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: how much did that cost?
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: dunno but it cost far less than the documentary
<Alchemist> I think around 15 grand
<Dark_Horst> documentary?
<Vivix> JdL
<Dark_Horst> damn, i've been out of the loop
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: where have you been? :D http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/257527888/bronycon-the-documentary?ref=live
<Dark92Enigma> rainbowfan: no answer?
<rainbowfan> Dark: Party of One
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: happen to know when it will be done?
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: if you check the "updates" tab on the kickstarter link I think its there, im not sure.
<Tovler> k, back
<DerpDash> Hey Everypony! :)
<Tovler> Hi, Dr. Nick
<Vivix> That made me laugh more than it should have
<rainbowfan> <3
<Dark_Horst> well, cant be long now. they already had the prescreening
<Alchemist> Yep. But I personally am not really interested in it.
<Alchemist> Though it was jaw dropping to see the funds it got :D
<Dark_Horst> i'll watch. if only becasue de lancie is in it xD
<Vivix> Same- I already know the things it explores, you know?
<Vivix> It could be interseting for outsiders to see though
<Alchemist> Vivix: exactly
<prince-dari> Hey Stormy
<Stormy> Hi
<Alchemist> problem is, why would an outsider watch it?
<Vivix> Dunno- curiosity I guess
<Alchemist> this isnt something that will be shown on history/discovery channel...
<Vivix> I guess it'll do okay for sales, because bronies who like JdL and friends- and a few outsiders
<Dark_Horst> trekkies porbably
<Vivix> maybe some trekkies yeah
<Stormy> this is probably the most dead I've ever seen this channel ._.
<Alchemist> Im not worried about the sales profit its gonna make.
<seatsea> Hi everypony
<Lil_B> I would just wanna see how they want to portrai Bronys
<prince-dari> Yeah, I dunno what happened to all the peopel that started turning up again
<seatsea> been a long time
<MadSurge> I do am interested in that Lil_B
<Vivix> I'm very interested in the bronystudy though
<DerpDash> Hey seatsea :)
<MadSurge> Welcome back seatsea! :)
<Vivix> hoping next part of the survey comes soon
<Lil_B> Alchemist well, it doesn't really need any, it got everything Via the Kickstarter
<prince-dari> People just need to idle here all the time like I do, then it'd be fine. :P
<Alchemist> Vivix: I thought that was completed already.
<Vivix> two or three part completed
<Alchemist> Hai Lil_B !
<Vivix> but they will probably do one more on the darker side, since the previous was on the borderside and community control thing side
<Dark_Horst> according to jdl, it will be respectful, insightful and very entertaining
<Lil_B> hey Alchemist :)
<pony_of_borg> sounds fun
<Alchemist> Lil_B: that money they used to actually make the film, they didnt get profit from the kickstarter funds.
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: I do trust Q :D
<Stormy> Yeah, haha
<Lil_B> Alchemist that I ment :)
<Vivix> but they won't loose money, so any made from sales would be an ok profit
<Stormy> I kind of started doing that, but sometimes I have to unplug my laptop :P
<rainbowfan> 99.
<rainbowfan> 101
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: of course
<rainbowfan> 100
<Dark_Horst> wat?
<pony_of_borg> What are those numbers for
<DerpDash> Heheh im so confused...
<rainbowfan> Umm... Chocolate milk. >_>
<DerpDash> ohhh
<DerpDash> i know what the numbers are
<Vivix> oh amount of users
<DerpDash> yep
<pony_of_borg> Resistance is futile
<MadSurge> You will be assimilated in the herd
<NullRadix> ... if that's alright with you
<pony_of_borg> Can you imagine something liker the Borg invading Equestria?
<prince-dari> Thank God for desktops. :P
<Alchemist> John delancie's words about the portrayal of bronies in the documentary: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGRdp9CcW0U from 29:30 to 32:00
<MadSurge> pony_of_borg: porbably would get their asses handed over in two seconds
<Tervicz> Can you imagine Pinkie Pie raising havoc on a Borg cube?
<pony_of_borg> The borg or the Ponies?
<MadSurge> Tervicz: The pink equine is completely illogical! Our systems fry trying to predict her actions!
<pony_of_borg> I could see Fluttershy's stare forcing a drone to break is connection to the borg hive mind
<Tervicz> The Borg might start puking rainbows....
<pony_of_borg> And borg sheilds only defend from energy weapons, being bucked by a strong pair of hooves will be very effective
<VenHur> Hello everypony!
<VenHur> ...I don't know who to vote...
<Dark_Horst> why doesnt the federation go all projectile weapon on them?
<Dark_Horst> that always bugged me
<pony_of_borg> I always wonder that
<Dark_Horst> would soleve so many problems
<Invi> hi VenHur
<pony_of_borg> you see picard using a machine gun only once on the borg, and that is in the holodeck
<Invi> hey Dark_Horst, have you read that german brony article?
<Dark_Horst> "we are the borg. lower your shields and prepa-" "TAAAANk MISSILE!"
<pony_of_borg> Worf sticks to his trusty batlift
<Dark_Horst> Invi: dont think i did
<Dark_Horst> should i?
<Invi> 7me shrugs
<Tervicz> Hmmm... They could have used them on that episode of DS9 where they defended that sensor station
<Tervicz> Machine guns
<Invi> (yeah, actually 7 mes >.>)
<Dark_Horst> or nuke
<Dark_Horst> s
<Vivix> Hammers?
<pony_of_borg> I wonder if the Borg could adapt to Twilight's magic missle
<Dark_Horst> probably not
<xles> "We are the Borg, you will be assi... -hey, you guys like bananas?"
<Dark_Horst> so far it'S been esablished that magic is it's own for of energy
<Dark_Horst> least i think
<pony_of_borg> Bananas are irrelivant
<pony_of_borg> Next thing you see the borg are stuffed with yellow fruit
<RaveBrony> Hey everypony, what are talking about today? :P
<Invi> hi RaveBrony
<Dark_Horst> i wonder if they could assimilate bananas
<pony_of_borg> Borg vs Ponies
<RaveBrony> Borg?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Dark_Horst> borg
<RaveBrony> Hiya Invi :)
<Dark_Horst> sounds swedish,d oesnt it?
<pony_of_borg> from star trek
<pony_of_borg> LOL
<Spartan_Brovakiin> Hai RaveBrony :)
<Dark_Horst> fun thing is, it actually does
<RaveBrony> Ah, lol. Im not familiar with star trek :D
<pony_5061> is there no streaming?
<Vivix> Borg means fortress in swedish I think, does in Norwegian at least
<Invi> indeed
<RaveBrony> Hey Spartan_Brovakiin, you get Halo 4? :D
<Lil_B> Hey Thar Invi and RaveBrony !
<xles> Vivix: It does indeed.
<Invi> hi Lil_B
<RaveBrony> Hey Lil_B :)
<HavokOC> G'day :D
<Spartan_Brovakiin> RaveBrony: Maybe >_> :d
<Invi> Lil_B, have you been on EQD today?
<RaveBrony> Lmao
<Spartan_Brovakiin> Hai HavokOC :)
<Lil_B> I alwys thought that Borg sounds somewhat Scandinavian
<Lil_B> Invi nope
<Invi> Lil_B, well then behold that 1st ppst there ^^
<Invi> *post
<xles> I assure you, scandinavians giggle at the mention of Borg every time. =P
<pony_of_borg> Borg? sounds swedish is a line spoken in one of the Star Trek movies
<Dark_Horst> these fellas http://www.geminifleetcommand.com/wiki/images/3/32/Borg_Drones.jpg
<Tervicz> I wonder why there's no Jedi in Star Trek :p
<HavokOC> Hey Spartan_Brovakiin :D
<pony_of_borg> Wrong Galaxy/ Universe LOL
<HavokOC> (dat response time)
<xles> Tervicz: Because Jedi is in a galaxy far far away, a long time ago. duh.
<pony_of_borg> Jedi Ponies?
<Vivix> Unicorns?
<HavokOC> also, xles. I don't giggle at the mention of Borg
<HavokOC> I rofl
<Tervicz> Jedi in Disneyland....Soon :p
<pony_of_borg> Would the Reble alliance symbol be there cutie mark?
<pony_of_borg> Star Wars was already been in Disney Land since the 80s
<xles> HavokOC: Well fair enough then. I giggle. =P
<HavokOC> :3
<pony_of_borg> only now disney do nto have to pay royalties for it
<Invi> Lil_B, what do you think? ^^
<Vivix> Smörgasbord means what in swedish? Because in Norwegian it sounds like butter goose table
<Dark_Horst> there are no jedi in star trek because jedi are fantasy cast
<Dark_Horst> star trek is scie fi
<xles> Vivix: Smörgåsbord, literally Sandwich table.
<Lil_B> Invi "Wenn Männer rosa Ponys lieben" "Der Düsseldorfer ist Fan der Serie "Mein kleines Pony" ... Thats insulting to me as a guy who likes the show and a guy who liky grammar and the coherent use of one language within an article
<Vivix> Aah
<Invi> lol
<Invi> ja
<Dark_Horst> whats with people and trying to translate names and titles all the time?
<Vivix> Min lille ponniii min lille ponni æææ æææ æææ æææ
<pony_of_borg> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
<Invi> well, stupid people have to understand the name of the show Dark_Horst ^^
<pony_of_borg> Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst yeah not even the show does it, and the german name for Pony is not Pony xD (well... one might argue that nowerdays -.-)
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: you dont want to know how the mane 6's names sound like in hungarian...
<pony_of_borg> Its not that Jedi is fantasy and Star Trek is Sci fi
<xles> What is it in german anyway? Something along the lines of Esel or something IIRC?
<Dark_Horst> i imagine htta to be mildly entertaining xD
<Lil_B> Invi "Der Brony weiß, wie es ist, auf sein Hobby angesprochen zu werden." well, I ose 2 times in school wearing my Rainbow Dash Shirt, and I didn't gfot a single Question or weird looks :/
<Vivix> Esel is donkey I think Eselhengste
<Dark_Horst> xles: no. thats a donkey
<pony_of_borg> Trek tries to make everything sounds plauseible with terminology and star wars is like becuase we can
<Eli> heyo guys
<Spartan_Brovakiin> Hai Eli :)
<xles> Donkey, pony, small horselike creature...
<pony_of_borg> Probbily in Equestria Thamagurgy is a reconized area of science
<Invi> Lil_B i think they mean cosplay ^^
<Vivix> Pony is ponni in norwegian, not sure where the word pony originated
<Dark_Horst> thing is, everybody nowadays says pony too
<Lil_B> Invi nope, the picture just showes a normal guy, and no mention of cosplay whatsoever
<Dark_Horst> with slightly different pronkuncation
<Invi> Lil_B, actually pony is a german term
<xles> Pony in swedish is Ponny...
<Invi> oh okay then /me shrugs
<Vivix> pony = horse horse != pony
<Dark_Horst> xles: funny, that'S how we say it xD
<Eli> Dark_Horst: ever heard a german say it? it sounds soo stupid in german...
<Lil_B> yeah... now it's a german word...
*Vivix checks etymylogy
<Lil_B> written Prony, spoken Ponni
<Dark_Horst> Eli: i am german B)
<Lil_B> written Pony*
<Vivix> mid 17th century: probably from French poulenet 'small foal', diminutive of poulain, from late Latin pullanus, from Latin pullus 'young animal'
<xles> However, for some reason, when I talk about mlp ponies I always type it as poni...
<pony_of_borg> Well English is a germaic lanuage so it is understabable some words have carried over
<Eli> Dark_Horst: well it does sound stupid. :P
<Invi> Lil_B, '' In Deutschland gibt es nicht nur die Unterscheidung zwischen Pony und Großpferd, wie international üblich, sondern zusätzlich auch noch die zwischen Pony und Kleinpferd.'' -Wikipedia
<Vivix> pony is french origin
<Dark_Horst> Eli: works both ways^^
<Vivix> thing witih pony is that it's a height and build classification, so not all countries have it natively
<Vivix> languages*
<Lil_B> Invi well, I like Wiki for sources of Knowledge, but not as a source of Grammar and Rechtschreibung :P
<Invi> lol
<Eli> Dark_Horst: what do you mean?
<pony_of_borg> french for pony is poney
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> the english origin is probably poulenet
<Dark_Horst> Eli: imagine that the english pronouncation sounds just as different to us
<Invi> Lil_B, ''Pony
<Invi> Substantiv, Neutrum - Pferd einer kleinen Rasse'' -Duden.de :P
<xles> Incidentally poney is also gump for pony.
<pony_of_borg> my little pony in frnech would be mon petit poney
<Lil_B> Invi noo! I will barricade behind my wall of disbelieve
<Invi> :D
<xles> Forest Gump ran and ran, and gave a poney to his beloved jenney. #truestory
<Alchemist> speaking of mlp and languages, have you guys seen the polish "find a pet" song? its awesome!
<Vivix> sadly no
<Lil_B> Invi "Deutsches Reitpony" "Ponyzüchtung" I surrender -.-
<Jmo> Pondoo
*Panda slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Vivix> Hehe
<Invi> ^^
<pony_of_borg> I was working on a story where Discord and Q was the same being, the same person if you will
<Alchemist> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1OQ6p9dsG4
<Vivix> informal a small glass or measure of alcohol:
<Vivix> a pony of vodka
<Vivix> wat
<Eli> Dark_Horst: i feel flattered that you think i'm english, but i'm swiss. i still think it sounds dumb in german (swiss german just as well)
<Invi> pawnduh ^^
<Dark_Horst> the more you know
<pony_of_borg> I don't assume anything, I only assume people think I am a trained chipanzee on a computer keyboard
<Lil_B> " meist zwischen 16 und 34 und heterosexuell" I don't care if the writer of this Article was pro, contra or neutral, or if I'm a pazifist or not, I wanna Strangle him now
<Panda> hiya Invi ^^
<Eli> pony_of_borg: i am :P
*Lil_B huggles Panda !
<pony_of_borg> LOL
<xles> Eli: You're a trained chimp?
<Spartan_Brovakiin> Hai Panda :)
<Jmo> Oi Pondoo
<Lil_B> Ei Grüß Gott Eli!
<Eli> xles: shit, blew my cover
*Panda huggles Lil_B
<Vivix> Wouldn't it be awesome if they took one of those trained chipms and hooked it up to irc?
<Panda> Jmo yeah?
<pony_of_borg> I would be confused for a ape if I ever go to Equestria so why not
<Dark_Horst> why would that need to be written n an article=
<Invi> Lil_B, xD well they try to wipe out stereotypes ^^ but it gets better ^^
<Jmo> Love the Arcanine picture.
<Vivix> "I hungry." "I hungry." "Stop" "I hungry."
<Eli> Lil_B: what are you copypastaing in here? article about bronies?
<xles> Eli: Well... That would explain your lack of punctuation... *whistle*
<Panda> Jmo ^^ danke
<pony_of_borg> or a really odd looking shaved Diamond dog
<Dark_Horst> Eli: yep
<Lil_B> Eli yeah, the linked artikle on EQD
<Lil_B> Eli stuff like that really gets me raging >: ( and I watched enough Internet Critics to know how to rage properly xD
<Eli> xles: nope. my lack of punctuation is just because i'm stupid :P
*Invi huggies dat pawnduh ^^
<pony_of_borg> I am just lazy
<xles> Eli: Good as reason as any. ^^
<pony_of_borg> and its the internet
<Eli> Lil_B: if they say "mostly 16-34 hetero" is that bad?
<Vivix> lazy excuse is better than internet excuse
<Lil_B> Eli nop, but I kinda don't like that this is what his description starts with
<Invi> Lil_B, german Discord 1 is out :D
<xles> You know. I think I'm gonna' go check the VA panels from EQLA.
<Invi> so much germany ^^
<pony_of_borg> I it me or from the websites graphic banner, Rainbow Dash is broed with what ever film they are watching
<Lil_B> Invi yeah, finally wanna hear John De Lances new Voice Actor
<Invi> me too...
<Invi> Lil_B, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QMHmipjkrc
<Invi> and aparrently: Dragoneequus = Drachenpony (= translated dragon pony)
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: what happened to the old one?
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst the Voice of him who did Q for example died in 2009
<Dark_Horst> well, crap
<Eli> Lil_B: nothing against homosexuality, but if they started to say bronies can be hetero too (in the news opinion, didn't use to be like this) i have nothing against it.
<Alchemist> german discord doesnt sound that bad.
<MadSurge> pony_of_borg: RD only likes action movies :D
<Alchemist> a bit infantile maybe
<pony_of_borg> I imagining they are watching some animated film
<DaxterSnickers> Meep
<Lil_B> Eli I don't really care at all for the mentioning of the sexualitys, I just hate that he felt like this was the thing to start of the description...
<pony_of_borg> Like their version of a Disney movie, and they probily just got to one of the many musical numbers
<Dark_Horst> i know that voice
<Dark_Horst> damn. where did i hear him before
<pony_of_borg> I think it is why Pinkie and FLuttershy seems to excited
<Eli> Lil_B: ok. well, could be worse. have you seen College humor's opinion on bronies?
<Invi> shh don't spoiler me Dark_Horst ^^
<Vivix> They have opinions?
<Eli> Vivix: nope. they just copy/paste fox news
<Vivix> Hehe
<Lil_B> Eli heard about it, I ingopre Stuff like this, both to avoid Haters and to avoid Bronys who act liked angared Wasps
<Vivix> I think I saw their animated skit
<pony_of_borg> I don't look at outsiders opnions of stuff I like. I don't need others to validate my own opinions
<Vivix> I didn't think it was bad, not super funny, but--just a joke
<Dark_Horst> well, wherever he was in... that doesnt really fit discord
<Lil_B> probably, they are a site about humor after all, but I honestly don't enjoy their other Stuff ether
<Vivix> Same
<Vivix> I did like their skyrim hoarding thing, but--that's it lately
<Vivix> if..that was them
<Alchemist> well you shouldnt enjoy ether that much anyways, its bad for you in the long run :D
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: who are we talking about?
<Vivix> College Humour
<alexxm> hey guys
<Dark_Horst> ah
<Vivix> Hiya alexxm
<Alchemist> hi alexxm !

<Eli> Lil_B: when planking was popular, i would have liked to kick them in the balls for their vid. 5secfilms did good tho
<Alchemist> Eli: hell yeah they did :D
<Eli> Alchemist: NO!
<Lil_B> LOL Discord has the Voice Actor oif German Patchy the Pirate from Spongebob Squarepants xD
<Saturn> 08,01it's 6pm for me

<Vivix> Ooh Saturn
<Vivix> You completely missed the sun!
<Saturn> 08,01Invi: Discord's VA is Q from Star Trek
<Lil_B> his Voice isn't bad, but I unfortunetly have not his other roles in the back of my head xD
<Alchemist> 6pm, only woke up an hour ago, wat
<Lil_B> Invi german voice of Q
<Invi> Saturn german discord ^^
<Invi> Lil_B, it is?
<Saturn> 08,01oh
<Lil_B> Invi sry,m I ment Saturn >.<
<pony_of_borg> Originally the studio was going to use someone that sounded like Q, but they found out they could get John DeLancie who actually played Q was a better choice
<Saturn> 08,01i was just talking about JdL to the head of Galacon
<Lil_B> whats JdL?
<Vivix> John deLancie
<Lil_B> oh
<Eli> Lil_B: your comments are getting kinda blurry... do you get enough sleep?

<Lil_B> Invi probably Chockolate http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GyJQYQnDuwk/UJji0OC6NzI/AAAAAAABA0E/Yi53_hbQ_nk/s1600/2.JPG
<PONYBASTARD> i like ponys
<Vivix> the ebay one has chocolate and ponies I think, I can see twilight at least
<PONYBASTARD> fuchs?
<Lil_B> choclate... foirget it, it's Schokolade
<Alchemist> PONYBASTARD: you dont say?!
<Dark_Horst> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/11/rumor-discussion-disney-looking-to-buy.html
<Invi> Lil_B, how much does it cost?
*SpeccyRush this wont last long
<Dark_Horst> you gotta be shitting me
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> i love trains
<Lil_B> Invi no Idea, I'l check Lidl
<SpeccyRush> Dark_Horst: slowpoke.jpg
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst awesome isn't it= xD
<Eli> Saturn: rewatching misfits, and right now, i love that show more than ever: sex scene to Dare! thanks so much for showing me this show
<Vivix> We'll see what happens;
<pony_6899> They just bought lucasfilms
<Dark_Horst> well, it would certainly raise the chance for a movie
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: seems news travel slower nowdays around you :D
<Dark_Horst> then again, disney doeas not like their stuff on youtube
<Vivix> yeah
<Dark_Horst> havent checked eqd during the weekend
<Vivix> Hasbro as licensor and Hub as network is better than disney and disney channel
<Dark_Horst> actually, i barely check it at all lately
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: well people always find a way to upload stuff.
<Invi> Lil_B, theytranslated fabulosity with fabelhaftigkeit xD
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> At last there might be a movie
<Vivix> nooo- at least 3 more seasons before movie pls
<Lil_B> Invi well... I tcould be worse... I guess...
<Eli> Saturn: the music in misfits is awesome anyways :)
<Alchemist> I'd prefer that the movie will be the last they do.
<Alchemist> get us a few more seasons before that
<Invi> indeed
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> needs more seasons in4 a movie
<Vivix> same
<Lil_B> ... thats the second time now that not the Tranlator butchered the Rhyme, but the VA... did nobody told hgim that it needs to have some flow?!
<Vivix> a movie would just be terrifying at this point
<Vivix> Ja, ich hast flow.
<Alchemist> Vivix: not necessarily. I trust in the storyboard writers, they did good so far.
<Vivix> oh god I'm butchering the language
<SpeccyRush> Lil_B: what? german discord?
<Vivix> well the storyboard artists do not write the movie
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> ja deutsch Discord
<Lil_B> SpeccyRush yes :/ spoke it as stiff as a stick
<Vivix> a movie would probably be well produced, but- what if different studio is needed due to time constraints? Who would write it?
<Vivix> it's too early, in my opinion
<SpeccyRush> Lil_B: which line
<pony_of_borg> man the mini grab bag of Princess cadance looks weird, its a repaint of Celestia
<Invi> I wonder if older gen villians will ever appear...
<pony_6259> Is there a Stream?
<SpeccyRush> so is the one of Luna, dont see me complainin' :P
<pony_of_borg> I agree we need more Tirek and Gogrog
<pony_of_borg> maybe the shoomze
<Invi> :D smooze
<pony_of_borg> yeah that
<Invi> i want smooze ^^
<pony_of_borg> Hey what happen to the talks of making Dr Whooves a canon caracter in MLP?
*SpeccyRush FirstVictimOfTheRainbowOfDarknessApocolypseSaysWhat?!? http://derpiboo.ru/127741
<Vivix> Could be interesting, who knows
<Vivix> I saw eh..
<Vivix> can't remember who, but someone drew ..g1 princess I think in G4 style
<Vivix> goorgeous pony-
<pony_of_borg> hasbro once had talsk with the BBC about it
<NullRadix> pony_of_borg: he's apparently named Dr. Hooves. Lawyers said they could get away with that much, but Whooves would be too much
<NullRadix> last I remember hearing...
<Lil_B> SpeccyRush when Discord talks to Rainbow Dash in the Labyrinth before he hypnotizes her
<Lil_B> Invi searched for Pony on the Lidl Site, but I couldn't find anything... exept Sony
<Invi> lol
<pot80_GLaDos> nobody home?
<pony_of_borg> Well I heard his name might be cahnged to Time Tunner
<Lil_B> SpeccyRush thje one for Luna?
<SpeccyRush> Lil_B: which one what now?, I can't remember what I said
<HavokOC> nuuuuuuuuu :c
<HavokOC> Won't be able to watch the season premiere untill it gets out on youtube or something like that D:
<HavokOC> I'm moving when it streams here
<HavokOC> :(
<Dark_Horst> why so streamless today?
<Dark_Horst> just noticed
<Dark_Horst> oh look, a tumbleweed
<HavokOC> suddenly, irc pops spam
<HavokOC> Dark_Horst, you also got spammed? >.<
<Lil_B> SpeccyRush [19:10:38] <SpeccyRush> so is the one of Luna, dont see me complainin' :P
<Vivix> Found: http://th08.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2012/301/e/1/black_islands_by_equestria_prevails-d5j6dcj.png
<DashWithRainbows> Gots to love dem kickbots.
<mitamaking> hello everyotter
<Vivix> G1 Galaxy with G1 Majesty's colour scheme-
<HavokOC> >.>
<Dark_Horst> spammed?
<HavokOC> Yup
<HavokOC> server slow, and i got spam kicked
<Dark_Horst> dont thinkso
<Lil_B> Invi I just found out something about the german BBBFF Song xD
<HavokOC> hmm
<Invi> Lil_B, what? ^^
<Dark_Horst> but my chat didnt do anything and then jumped downwardfs
<Vivix> I thought Dr Hooves was named Time Turner?
<Dark_Horst> appearatnly it lagged
<SpeccyRush> Lil_B: ah yes well what i was saying is the mini blindbag of luna is just a recolour of celestia too just like the cadance one is in response to borg pony guy
<Lil_B> SpeccyRush oh, sorry than :(
<HavokOC> It just dropped like over 30 messages in about 5 seconds
<pony_of_borg> Vivix, thats that the trading cards ended up calling him
<Vivix> Okay, cause I kinda like that name
<Alchemist> wat http://derpiboo.ru/144484
<Lil_B> Invi well, in german it's GBUBF , which sounds amazingly Dorky if you say it xD
<pony_of_borg> but I really wonder if that pony have a tardis or not
<Invi> Lil_B, ikr? xD
<Lil_B> Invi "Er ist mein GBUBF!" I love it xD
<Alchemist> GBUBF sounds like a secret weapon's codename
<pony_of_borg> maybe it will read Pony Box instead of Police box
<Invi> lol
<mitamaking> So seems season 4 just got confirmed
<TVNOOD> Hello.
<Invi> not to 100%
<Invi> hi TVNOOD
<Jmo> Allo TVNOOD
<pony_of_borg> mitamaking got a link?
<Spartan_Brovakiin> Hai TVNOOD
<mitamaking> No stream right now?
<Alchemist> basically we will have a "normal length" S3, just in two pieces?
<Vivix> woo s4
<Vivix> not really, I think
<Invi> Alchemist, we will?
<Vivix> I think 13 episodes is because of DHX contracts and some time constraints
<mitamaking> pony_of_borg: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/11/possible-season-4-official-confirmation.html
<Alchemist> Invi: well, I guess S4 would also be 13 eps
<Vivix> but next season was said to be full length, according to..Andrew something
<Vivix> no, they saidn ext is full length a long time ago
<Vivix> but that means s4 wont be until fall 2013
<Invi> nooo
<Alchemist> Vivix: I missed that. disregard what I said then.
<mitamaking> Could the movie be this summer then?
<Vivix> I can't remember who it was, but I think it was the bgm guy who wrote a blog about why 13 episodes and what is up for the next seasons
<Vivix> no, there's no movie being worked on I think
<Invi> Lil_B, at least she doesn't use GBUBF in the song ^^
<Vivix> I think DHX bought a studio, and had to complete some contracts that wouldn't allow them to do 25 episodes- but don't quote me on that
<mitamaking> I think a movie is a foregone conclusion
<pony_of_borg> only 13 episodes, a half season. I think they are pacing them selves for something
<Alchemist> Vivix: bgm guy? william anderson?
<Vivix> yeees
<Vivix> he als osaid "Seasons" on purpose he said
<Vivix> so- s5 is possible
<Lil_B> Invi well, nor does "BBBFF" gets used in the BBBFF song :) only the whole words
<mitamaking> 6 seasons and a movie
<Vivix> I doubt there's a movie coming noow, but maybe near the end of the run
<Invi> trrrrru ^^
<Alchemist> that sounds good
<pony_of_borg> You know G3 MLP never went out of production
<mitamaking> I think I heard that
<Vivix> Only time will tell what is going on, but that's my understanding of it-
<Alchemist> I mean six seasons and a movie would be great. Not too short, not too long, just about right.
<Vivix> I'm secretly hoping for eight, but- six sounds good to me
<Invi> depends on how many ideas they have Alchemist
<mitamaking> PPG, Foster's, KND, a few more I forget, are all 6 seasons and a movie
<Bronysith> okay so
<Bronysith> ?
<Vivix> Fister's is six?
<Vivix> damn- I need to get those
<Vivix> I only saw 2
<Bronysith> what part of Lauren faust has nothing to do with MLP FIM now
<Bronysith> she doesnt write for them anymore
<Alchemist> Invi: I think six seasons would still be good if only 3/4 of it is based on good ideas
<Invi> hm true
<Vivix> Who cares about faust, it's all about wooty and thiessen
<pony_of_borg> I nopice with MLP FiM they are willing to adpot some fan ideas and fan fics for ideas for show plots
<Vivix> not fanfics
<Vivix> trust me, writers never read fan works
<pony_of_borg> The only reason Derpy showed up so much because the fan base loves her
<Vivix> it can get them into shit-tons of legal trouble, simpsons trash fanscripts on receival
<Alchemist> I also thought they aren't encouraged to look into fanfics
<Invi> Vivix, how do you know?
<Invi> oh okay
<Dark_Horst> they cant. of they had idas in the show that stemmed from fanfics, they could get sued
<Bronysith> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md2v0ie2HG1r3xauuo1_1280.png
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't even think Faust is involved with MLP anymore.
<Vivix> if they read something and use an idea, they can get sued
<pony_of_borg> Actually the 7th book of Harry Potter is based on fan fics
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: she isnt
<Vivix> Faust hasn't been involved since season 1
<mitamaking> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/19/iQSxUQ5pxU6YoA9wKSydrA2.png
<Vivix> Thiessen, Jim Miller, the writers and Wooty is the backbone of the show
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: also hello Aniki how are you today?
<Vivix> Faust did a great dev work though
<pony_of_borg> Faust isn't part of the regular crew any more but she still works as a consultant
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good Bronysith.
<Vivix> I don't think she consults anymore either
<Bronysith> since faust left the show has been going down in quality slowly
<Alchemist> samurai jack is only 4 seasons I think, Dexter's lab is even less, but Im not sure.
<Vivix> I totally disagree Bronysith, but we know you don't care about our opinions
<Bronysith> Alchemist: samurai jack had nothing to do with faust
<mitamaking> I think Dexter went on too long
<pony_of_borg> He husban is working on she show, Faust still has some influence
<Bronysith> Vivix: i never said that
<Alchemist> Bronysith: I never said it did...
<mitamaking> And Samurai Jack needs more
<pony_of_borg> her*
<Vivix> I think the show has increased in quality greatly since s1, and I thank thiessen and the other leaders of the show
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord depends, if she's off the credits than yes, if she still is... whats the name... consultive Producer than she might still has some influences in some minor design or Story things
<Vivix> Sorry Bronysith, but last time you kinda sounded like it. I shouldn't assume though
<Bronysith> Vivix: i never said i dont care for peoples opinions
<Bronysith> im not my moronic father =_=
<Vivix> I don't think she's involved at all anymore Lil_B, I think Thiessen and wooty took over all her responsibilities
<Vivix> Sorry Sith- you never said it, but-- yeah, assuming is bad, so sorry
<pony_of_borg> Imagine Luna using the tradtional royal canter to yell out loud as she can, "Crytalist's mother was a stinkbug"
<pony_of_borg> and you here a distant ARRRGGGGG being screamed
<Lil_B> Vivix yeah, but thats the kind of thing where I really wanna see some kind of official statment that at least hgints atr it, but yeah, even for S2 she was only helping in the first 3 eps
<Vivix> She was involved at all? I thouht she stopped consulting iiin mid s1
<SpeccyRush> Lil_B you're drunk go to bed
<Vivix> but yeah IMDB probably knows... but eh Big Jim Miller, Wooty, Jaysson Thiesen, Amy Keating Rogers- the other steady writers-
<pony_of_borg> Lauren might be involved unoffically as well
<Vivix> they made the show what it is from the great development Faust did in S1
<Vivix> Nah, she didn't know anything bout the season closure for instance
<pony_of_borg> as in other people boucing ideas off of her
<Lil_B> Vivix no, she said it herself, I think it was at Bronycon, could be wrong on the location thoug, but I know for she sure that she said it
<Vivix> Okay, I haven't looked into it, but yeah she did consult for a while
<Lil_B> SpeccyRush I don't even drink Alcohol, nort do I take drugs or smoke
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352225824915.jpg
<Bronysith> Lil_B: nice

<Snow> DAT IS GEWOON VERKEERD
<Dark_Horst> da ist eine kernfusion in meiner bratwurst
<Saturn> 08,01mein freund kommt aus Niederlands
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst sometimes, I look at Dutch, and I think it's the weirdest of german accents...
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: ikr?
<ekips> suddenly, german chat
<Alchemist> dutch have it easy. I believe it takes almost no effort for them to learn english and german. Half of the vocabulary is already there.
<MadSurge> ponizrul732: you'll be all pumped up then after the premiere :D
<Snow> Saturn: dat is leuk voor je.
<Snow> :P
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: actually, German is like Hard-Mode Dutch
<Vivix> dutch looks interesting-
<Saturn> 08,01Snow: seer leuk
<Vivix> Heldige de ja
<Snow> Vivix: its one of the most hardest languages to learn
<Lil_B> well... if that would be true, than Dutch is appearently too easy for me to understand xD
<Alchemist> I should learn a second language...
<Alchemist> I mean third
<Vivix> yeah, but like with Norwegian, some dutch looks almost similar, but used differenlty
<Vivix> it looks bizarre
<Snow> Alchemist: ga nederlands leren!
<Vivix> like taternorsk
<Alchemist> Snow: I think russian/french/german would be more useful
<sonicdude558> uh
<Kencolt> Ouch, everyone. I have returned, with pain.
<sonicdude558> Hello Guys :)
<Vivix> Hiya
<Lil_B> hi Kencolt and sonicdude558 !
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, sonicdude558. :)
<Etharian> hello everypony:)
<Snow> Alchemist: everyone in germany knows english, so thats out of the question.
<Snow> dont need that there anymore.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Etharian. :)
<Dark_Horst> when wrek gets back on air he should stream a german episode of ds9
<Kencolt> Monday, it all happened. I had every tooth in my head ripped out (and there was much blood) and am not wearing "training" dentures that are irritating and somewhat wobbly.
<Dark_Horst> that might have interesting chst reactions
<Lil_B> finally got a normal Music Project to work on again, A Waltz version of This day Aria, siddenly came to my mind, I always wanted to make a Waltz
<Snow> dutch is fun to know
<sonicdude558> hi again. My web browser derpd. 6_9
<Snow> especially when people from forgein language try to pronounce duth sentences
<Snow> the accents
<Snow> they make me laugh
<Alchemist> maybe, but I dont want to invest at least 2 years to know a fun language if Its not practical for me.
<Vivix> Snow flem everywhere?
<sonicdude558> the stream is broke
<Snow> Vivix: uhmmmm....Flem?
<Dark_Horst> you're right
<sonicdude558> is the stream broke for everypony else?
<Vivix> like--chh noise?
<Dark_Horst> yomeone fix it
<Alchemist> Snow: spit
<Dark_Horst> stream stuff!
<Snow> also that
<Sonny> gtg I'll be back alter :3
<Vivix> I notice a lot of people overdo it insanely when learning languages
<Snow> but brittish people for example
<Alchemist> Snow: I mean flem=spit
<Snow> that sounds hilarious
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: what do you mean, overdo?
<Snow> and no, we only "flem"on the letter P
<Vivix> like instead of a mild ch noise, they like hack their throat and choke on the noise
*sonicdude558 feels weird
<Vivix> you know, like a parody
<Snow> its just the accents that make it funny
<Etharian> I just wanted to swing by and say hello, so now I'm leaving BYE.;)
<Snow> thats all.
<Dark_Horst> ah, know what you mean
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, Etharian. :)
<sonicdude558> lol hello and goodbye Etharian
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye Etharian
<Dark_Horst> to be fair though, getting the th right isnt that easy either^^
<Snow> like, try to make a brittish guy speak german for example
<Alchemist> If I could choose freely i would study polish. russian sounds too barbaric for me.
<Vivix> Yeah, I've had fun listening to british try to speak Norwegian
<Vivix> jaai heeh tuuhr
<Alchemist> Though russian might prove useful if I wanted to intimidate someone ina dark alley.

<BerryPunch> Dark_Horst: Dark_Horst has been kicked 0 times
<Dark_Horst> lol
<Dark_Horst> that cant be right^^
<Chrysalis> MadSurge whats terrifying is its been seen in several states
<Chrysalis> and the staff wont do anything about it
<Michael> pfff
<MadSurge> Pffff
<MadSurge> It's Bush jr all over again
<Kencolt> Interestingly enough, certain machines in early voting districts were shufling Romney votes to Obama. Seems less sabotage and more machine failure.
<Mistress_Rainbowdash> well good night everypony bed time for me
<Michael> who knows...
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Mistress_Rainbowdash. :)
<Michael> Gnight Mistress_Rainbowdash
<MLP_Brovakiin> goodnight Mistress_Rainbowdash :)
<Sumica> 00,10so is the stream even working or no?
<MadSurge> Kencolt: yeah, faulty computers seem the case
<CriticKitten> They're having the problem all over the place, on both sides.
<pony_7777> its working
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<CriticKitten> There's some machines apparently changing Obama votes to Romney ones.
<Michael> it works!
<sonicdude558> Works for me
<CriticKitten> And vice versa.
<JRP> Hi all
<SpeccyRush> yes Sumica
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, JRP. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi JRP
<Michael> ohai JRP!
<CriticKitten> Which just goes to show, why would you trust a machine to count votes anyways?
<twilight_sprinkle> and yeah those machines are just glitchy im thinking, itd be stupid to make the cheating that obvious if they really intented it
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: we still trust people doing it in fact
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, GilDash. :)
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/6334460982a724ddac0a80e15011f117.jpg :O 'tis so epic
<SpeccyRush> I like this girl
<MadSurge> Hello GilDash!
<Michael> ohai GilDash!
<CriticKitten> MadSurge: I don't trust people much more than the machines. There's been some serious funny business with the primaries, too.
<Tovler> It won't stop raining. I guess I'll stay home today.
<Michael> MadSurge: zelda + MLP? great :D
<CriticKitten> Like one district which reported zero votes for Ron Paul, despite at least two large families professing to have voted for him.
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: maybe one person, but multiple people? Naaah
<CriticKitten> Oh you better count on it.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/Rp0Fg.jpg
<Tovler> maybe he is legion.
<CriticKitten> Make no mistake, if there is any time in American history to don that tinfoil hat, it's now.
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: there have been reports of cheating, but they've been spotted by counter-cheaters :D
<Dark_Horst> okay, this is where it gets bullshit
<CriticKitten> We're just a few steps away from blatant ballot box stuffing.
<Dark_Horst> magic? fine. no arguing with that
<Dark_Horst> but a wire net?
<Dark_Horst> no
<CriticKitten> A few very small steps.
<JRP> Foo fighters has best concert
<Sumica> 00,10Dont need magic to kick his ass

<Ponies47> Bye CrimsonPhoenix|ACT have fun
<Tovoted> Vermont Supreme
*Ponies47 Is a good actor but has a terrible voice
<DocSane> Bernie Sanders keeps his Senate seat!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cool. I like Bernie Sanders.
<JlcJcdc> For some reason the videos never load for me

<Mutterguy> here anyone can set up a part so long as the pay the $300 to the electoral comission and they get into parliment if they get either a electorate seat or 5% of the vote
<Vordox> Why Pirate Party has my vote
<Tovoted> I liked that filibuster thing Bernie Sanders did.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The US needs a couple of Pirate Party seats in the house. Keeps the copyright monopoly in check.
<Saturn> 08,01^
<Lunar_Brony> Vordox pfft, 'Mericans can't tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi.
<Vordox> Lunar_Brony: ....
<Vordox> Lunar_Brony: My point is what again?
<Ponies47> Thanks for DA watch Nittany_Discord, I watched you back ^^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You're welcome Ponies47.
<Lunar_Brony> You see, I give no shit towards politics, but it made a reference to Coke and Pepsi tasting similar.
<Lunar_Brony> so I went straight towards the Coke and Pepsi ref
<Lunar_Brony> kk?
<fluttercry> 05,15I belive there isn't a stream on at the moment
<Vordox> Lunar_Brony: Your point...?
<fluttercry> 05,15Pepsi is clearly superior
<Lunar_Brony> I was making a point?
<Lunar_Brony> no it isn't fluttercry, Coca-Cola is
<Vordox> Lunar_Brony: Speaking...-> Point there
<SpeccyRush> coke and pepsi taste the same
<fluttercry> 05,15Pepsi is sweeter
<Tovoted> its pretty much fact that Coke is better.
<Lunar_Brony> that's one reason why I'm not a big fan of Pepsi.
<Lunar_Brony> and it has a milder taste IMO
<Lunar_Brony> especially from plastic bottles
<Saturn> 08,01pepsi is vile deathdrink
<Saturn> 08,01coke is not much better
<Saturn> 08,01everyone knows that the true fizzy drink is Irn Bru
<J_E_Smith71> |Dr Pepper beats both Coke and Pepsi
<Lunar_Brony> never heard of it Saturn
<Tovoted> I secretly feel that way about alcohol in general
<weeping_pegasi82> I personally don't see the difference between coke an pepsi
<Saturn> 08,01Lunar_Brony: that's because it's scottish
<weeping_pegasi82> *and
<Vordox> Saturn: Any fruit soda > Cola... And add in Ice Cream :p
<GilDash> Funny. Despite the fact I like both Pepsi and Cola (Cola wins for me) I also refer to them as "liquid death". XD
<J_E_Smith71> Saturn: Is that a regional soda only?
<J_E_Smith71> Well that answered that
<Lunar_Brony> I like Dr Pepper J_E_Smith71, but it has a unique taste. I'm comparing Colas, see
<Saturn> 08,01scotland is one of the only countries in the world where there is a more popular soft drink than coke
<Saturn> 08,01that's what irn bru is
<Saturn> 08,01no-one in scotland drinks coke
<Buytoast> but the superior soft drink is Mountain Dew Gamer Fuel
<Saturn> 08,01everyone drinks irn brew
<GilDash> Irn-Bru is fucking lovely.
<Lunar_Brony> I want that stuff.
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: sorry, irn bru beats the dew
<GilDash> And orange.
<Buytoast> especially when washing down some Nacho "Master Cheese" Doritoes
<GilDash> But especially lovely.
<Buytoast> don't forget to buy Halo 4
<Saturn> 08,01see, GilDash knows what i mean
<Lunar_Brony> One day, I will fly to Scotland and drink Irn Bru
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash is a cool guy
<fluttercry> 05,15Doritos and Mtn.Dew teamed up with Halo 4 to bribe Geoff Keighly
<Lunar_Brony> sounds 'bout right
<GilDash> I also like Dandelion & Burdock, but that's the Yorkish in me.
<Buytoast> he could've at least sold out for something tastier
<Buytoast> like cheese popcorn
<Vordox> OOH FOR FUCK SAKE
<fluttercry> 05,15http://images.eurogamer.net/2012/articles//a/1/5/2/2/9/2/6/lh18_1.png/EG11/resize/600x-1
<Buytoast> Doritoes are just shit
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: out of sheer curiosity, are you straight?
<Vordox> MICROSOFT
<Vordox> Wat are you doing
<fluttercry> 05,15look at his eyes
<Vordox> Microsoft
<Vordox> stahp
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rZBetPryRg
<Buytoast> the eyes of the soulless
<GilDash> Saturn: Difficult question that I'd prefer not to answer.
<Tovoted> Doritos jacked are awesome though
*Saturn 08,01write GilDash into his "try hitting on" notebook
<Buytoast> can't stomach any doritos
<GilDash> XD
<GilDash> Saturn: You are welcome to try. XD
<Lunar_Brony> But one does not know the true taste of a soft drink until they drink Jones Sugar Cane soda.
<Saturn> 08,01hells to the yeah.
<Stinko|TF2> His eyes look like he wants to take you to his "Game Room"
<Lunar_Brony> Made and bottled here in Canada too :)
<Saturn> 08,01we've got a lot more staffers for BUCK next year
<Saturn> 08,01so i'll be less busy
<Saturn> 08,01might be able to actually play a game of "how many 'staters can i get in bed with?"
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<GilDash> XD
<Buytoast> then you could also play the game "Are you certain you're 18?"
<JRP2234-Zzz> what
<SpeccyRush> gl Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: 16 in the UK
<Lunar_Brony> Note to self: be extremely cautious if you ever meet Saturn IRL
<Saturn> 08,01also i just ate a crap-ton of chocoalte! \o/
<fluttercry> 05,15Someone voted in a Big Bird suit. YEAH AMERICA
<Buytoast> well then you might get a score then
<GilDash> And if you're coming to BUCK by yourself you have to be 16. I think. Under 16's need supervision, right Saturn?
<Buytoast> ha
<Saturn> 08,01Lunar_Brony: oh, i say that; i don't really hit on people much irl, especially if i know they wouldn't be into me
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: aye
<Buytoast> One of these candidates is not like the others.
<Saturn> 08,01under 12s get in free
<Buytoast> One of these candidates just doesn't belong.
<Saturn> 08,01i think
<GilDash> Saturn: Huh, I didn't know that. Awesome...
<GilDash> Saturn: What do you mean, "I think"? XD
<Saturn> 08,01not sure if we kept that or not
<Saturn> 08,01this was a whole 3 months ago! i can' remember that far back!
<SpeccyRush> Saturn: you think? you're the chairman aren't you supposed to know everything
<GilDash> Hey, I use the phrase, "I've slept since then," so... XD
*Tovoted feels his heart twinge. -no pizza for him
<Buytoast> i wish i could remember a month back
<Saturn> 08,01SpeccyRush: i'm not wearing my chairman hat today
<Saturn> 08,01i'm wearing my bronystate techie hat
<GilDash> SpeccyRush: There's a *lot* to know. Why do you think they've made such a big push for more staff this year?
*Saturn 08,01is getting the site ready for an estimated 10,000 users on saturday
<naturesfury> is that all?
<SpeccyRush> thats more then the s2 finale
<Saturn> 08,01naturesfury: way more than any other streaming site
<fluttercry> 05,15BTW have you all voted in our survey on the front page?
<GilDash> 10,000 users is quite a lot for the size of something like BUCK.
<Time> About to have dinner. :)
<Saturn> 08,01urgh, i've been waiting for 5 minutes for this dmaned VM to boot
<Mutterguy> there's a survey???
<NocturnalBlade> fluttercry: i have ^_^
<Lunar_Brony> fluttercry eeyup.
<Cypresswolf> Hello Everyone :) How are things?
<Time> Nice
<naturesfury> i bet 100 dollars luna eplipsed makes #1
<NocturnalBlade> ohai Cypresswolf ^_^
<Lunar_Brony> hi Cypresswolf. Things are gooooood
<Saturn> 08,01ah great, it went into the initrd...
<Mutterguy> Is it 'vote for your episode'?
<Lunar_Brony> mm hmm
<Tovoted> hm. Black Swan or Speed Racer for A
<Mutterguy> I need a D50
<Mutterguy> *D51
<Saturn> 08,01Tovoted: black swan
<Cypresswolf> whats the line up for the movie night this week? I need to update the Texas forum for this weekend's stream
<Tovoted> When's the next mod movie week?
<J_E_Smith71> Cypresswolf: How To Train Your Dragon, Jetsons
<Mutterguy> yay! i voted!
<Time> Voted! ;)
<J_E_Smith71> Cypresswolf: Plus we have Top 10 episode marathon after BMN
<Lunar_Brony> that's going to be awesome.
<Tovoted> Feels weird complaining about how overbearing and not subtle Requiem for a Dream is then turn around and pick Black Swan for A.
<Cypresswolf> :) I included the top 10 pony eps
<Midnight_Fyre> Mutterguy: Awesome
<Cypresswolf> speaking of, what are the pony eps for movie night?
<Mutterguy> not in the US though. just for the episode.
<J_E_Smith71> Cypresswolf: Suited for Sucess and...for some reason I can't rememer the second one. Which one was it?
<sonicdude558> I'm back
<fluttercry> 05,15Ticket Master
<J_E_Smith71> fluttercry: Thank you
<fluttercry> 05,15no problem
<GilDash> Anyone watching the news channels for the US elections?
<StuffCrusader> hello everypony :)
<DocSane> I am.
<Midnight_Fyre> Tovoted: Black Swan lacks subtlety as well, but it's a big step up from Requiem. To be honest though, the only Arronofsky film I've really liked is the Wrestler
<fluttercry> 05,15I am
<Lunar_Brony> hi StuffCrusader
<Lunar_Brony> I am
<Lunar_Brony> not
<fluttercry> 05,15Flipping between CNN and ABC
<GilDash> I'm on BBC myself.
<Cypresswolf> :) thats OK, I'll leave it blank
<DocSane> But then, I have a personal stake in them.
<Cypresswolf> thanks fluttercry :)
<fluttercry> 05,15funny, BBC shows our election, yet none of our news outlets covered the parliment elections
<DocSane> I just have MSNBC on while I check Twitter, Facebook, and Huffington Post.
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> Gotta do some baking. Be back in a few!
<naturesfury> bill clinton is gonna win guys get over it ,sigh i swear
<GilDash> fluttercry: That's okay, the Beeb covered that too. XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is Steam down for other people right now?
<Midnight_Fyre> GilDash: No tv for me. I hate tv. I've got ABC and CNNs sites up though
<naturesfury> i see no stream atm
<sonicdude558> me
<Tovoted> I'll be listening to This Week in Blackness radio at 8 EST
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> Nittany_Discord yeah, I'm offline
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> I can't connect
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> dufuq?
<GilDash> Midnight_Fyre: I'm watching the BBC news livestream. I can't be arsed with TVs either. XD
<StuffCrusader> today at school, we held an election for somekind of president. we could vote for anyone we wanted, so i voted for Cave Johnson
<Tovoted> Its too bad Grover Cleveland already served twice as president, or I'd vote for him.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Obama is winning SC. That will change soon. SC always goes Republican.
<fluttercry> 05,15He doesn't want your damn lemons. What's he supposed to do with those?
<Tovoted> Cave Johnson was a pretty good Post Master General way back when.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord community is down, store is not
<StuffCrusader> yep. shame he died from moon poisoning. why luna, why!?
<Cypresswolf> Done & Done :)
<Midnight_Fyre> I really really really wanted to write in Derpy Hooves on my ballot because I hate both candidates, but I ended up voting for Romney just because I have to live with my parents and they would never let me hear the end of it if I voted against Romney
<StuffCrusader> i feel your pain Midnight_Fyre
<GilDash> Midnight_Fyre: You can *lie* to them, you know. I voted against my father, but I lied to him about it.
<Tovoted> Not if there's a voting receipt
<Saturn> 08,01hehehehe
<Midnight_Fyre> I'm a horrible liar. I wouln't have gotten away with it
<Saturn> 08,01i was just on to tech support for Rackspace
<Cypresswolf> Im going to relax the best I can tonight - got my favorite food - Enchiladas Verdes from my fav restaurant & my traditional whiskey stein - if that don't settle my nerves, nothing will
<Saturn> 08,01and the guy was a brony
<Midnight_Fyre> Doesn't matter anyway because my vote doesn't matter
<Saturn> 08,01and so was his manager
<sonicdude558> :O
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> that's awesome
<Saturn> 08,01told him to come on here on saturday to watch the new series with us
<GilDash> Well, next general election I'll be casting an "interesting" vote. XD
<sonicdude558> Saturn are you kidding or not?
<StuffCrusader> Cypresswolf: nice
<Saturn> 08,01sonicdude558: i'm dead serious
<Kanda|EndOfPonyFast> Steam is working for me, Nittany_Discord
*Saturn 08,01is setting up new load balacning systems for saturday

<Lunar_Brony|AFK> Saturn hooray for new guys!
<sonicdude558> Steam is back
<Stormy> Hopefully one of these thousands of papers will work so I can register
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> it is?
<Midnight_Fyre> GilDash: By the next election I'll be moved out and I intend to vote for whichever fictional character I damn well want to
<DeadpoolDash> poop
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> not here
<sonicdude558> yes
<StuffCrusader> ya cuz all i get is captian buffer
<sonicdude558> for me at least.
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> then why the hell am I still offline?
<Cypresswolf> all I see is that dreaded buffer wheel *gets dizzy watching wheel* O_o
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> And why the hell am I AFK?
<StinkomanFan> VOTE FOR TWILIGHT SPARKLE
<GilDash> Midnight_Fyre: Oh, I'm not voting for anyone. I'm going to write something to the effect of, "You're all the same anyway; why bother?" Perhaps not as nicely put though. XD
<Midnight_Fyre> Good thinking
<Stormy> if they don't then too bad, I'm not going back there again
<Saturn> 08,01it's funny whenever i talk to an american on the phone, my voice goes super scottish
<StinkomanFan> Fun fact: Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse get thousands of write-in votes every presidential election
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> "Dear Congress: you can go fuck youselves! Sincerely . . . ME!"
<Cypresswolf> Lunar_Brony|AFK: well, past you went looking for you and told us if you got back before you returned to keep you here
<Midnight_Fyre> Today is also my birthday. My parents bought me sushi for dinner. It's yummy
<Tovoted> I end up mocking the accent of the person I'm talking to.
<Time> Happy B-Day. :)
<Midnight_Fyre> Thanks Time
*Mistress_Lyra` agreed to take a 24 hour shift, in exchange for booze
<StuffCrusader> Midnight_Fyre: happy b-day! just becareful of the fish parasites that eat you fomr the inside, ok!? :)
<sonicdude558> after all this time, I have finally got ***suits out of my head.
<Bronysith> Midnight_Fyre: i love specialty sushi
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> Cypresswolf really? Well, if you see my past self, tell him to get the fuck up and do some baking. Then I wouldn't have to.
<Midnight_Fyre> StuffCrusader: Thanks ;)
<StuffCrusader> my cat just crawled al over my keyboard, and is now in my face....
*Mistress_Lyra` slaps Bronysith around a bit with a large trout
<Cypresswolf> Lunar_Brony|AFK: Will do :)
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> But the universe doesn't work like that, so I'm going to have to do the baking -__-
<Lunar_Brony|AFK> seeya
<GilDash> I wonder: Does all the international support for Barack (from what I've seen in comments on websites) have a negative impact on voters as he is seen as "less American"?
<StuffCrusader> idk... GilDash
<fluttercry> 05,15It does among some of the more "patriotic" lot
<Time> Cany cane text
<Time> *Candy
<Mutterguy> is that double talk for stupid?
<spight> Oi. /
<Mistress_Lyra`> im in the army, and i dont want mitt as my commander
<StuffCrusader> man, i'm not really very politacal at all. all i want is a dude that won't screw of nation over.
<Mistress_Lyra`> a rich white man, who abuses money, with his own army.
<Mistress_Lyra`> i dont like that.
<fluttercry> 05,15I saw a graph earlier that showed international views on the candidates and it was a shit load of Obama and like...no Romney
<Time> Oven Mitt Romney
<StinkomanFan> Lyra Mitt Romney?
<Mistress_Lyra`> nope
<Mistress_Lyra`> he just doesnt seem like a trustworthy man
<Mistress_Lyra`> also, his wife is annoying
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: Pretty much the only country outside the US that supports Romney is Israel, and that's because he'd back a war with Iran
<Time> :D
<StuffCrusader> so... how was everyone's day? :l
<SpeccyRush> daris posting bs again
<GilDash> Romney has very far-right views that he initially expressed, but has suppressed saying them for the purpose of gaining more voters. Essentially, he's saying what he believes he needs to to win. Barack generally keeps along the same line as before, making him seem much more trustworthy. The UK right now is getting good at spotting political BS with all that has happened in the coalition government right now.
<GilDash> Sorry for the text wall.
<Bronysith> lets stop with this plz =_=
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Mistress_Lyra`
<Time> Politics :|
<Bronysith> if i hear anymore political bullshit in here
<fluttercry> 05,15But nobody is arguing. We're being pretty mature
<StuffCrusader> the buffer snake wants to eat it's own tail
<GilDash> Bronysith: Alright, I'll try not to put too many Romney quotes in here. :p
<Time> Nom
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: As much as I don't like politics, it's a part of life.
<J_E_Smith71> Bronysith: It's election night what do you expect?
<Vordox> Sumica: !
<Bronysith> politics is bullshit
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol StuffCrusader
<Vordox> Sumica: Guess what! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onRgx_swyPo
<Bronysith> either vote for retard A or retard B
<XxNightHawk64xX> OMG
<Bronysith> or do what i did and write in Molestia
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol Bronysith.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I voted for a real candidate.
<XxNightHawk64xX> im playin story of the blanks right now. WTF is this
<J_E_Smith71> Bronysith: Right now the country's in big mess, so it's you job to pick the guy who will screw up...less
<Bronysith> J_E_Smith71: either way we lose
<Bronysith> one way we lose slower than the other
<naturesfury> it gets very dark neer the end XxNightHawk64xX
<Tovoted> I should have worn a black beret; scare some white folks.
<GilDash> If I were American I'd actually vote for a real candidate, seeming as it seems to be so close running up to the end.
<Midnight_Fyre> Bronysith: Not sure if you saw my post earlier, but I really wanted to vote for Derpy. I ended up just giving my ballot to my mom and telling her to fil it out however she wants because I got sick of hearing my parents lecture me about how to vote
<XxNightHawk64xX> naturesfury: OH... GREAT... just what i need
<XxNightHawk64xX> naturesfury: as if luna games 0-5 wasnt enough
<Mutterguy> You you what's more reliable than ballot machines... semipermanent markers and paper
<spight_> Also most forum polling systems.
<Derpy_Hooves> i don't give a shit about who wins, but what i have been hearing about romney worries me...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol all political campaigns better be like THIS in the future :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEIi3X9NCMU
<spight_> Are more reliable than ballot machines, I mean.
<Cypresswolf> My parents were mad I didn't vote early - when asked why I didnt, told them I wasn't worried about Romney winning Texas - Obama is pretty much vilified around here anyway
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> same here Derpy_Hooves
<Saturn> 08,01rackspace tech support are really cool
<Tovoted> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D0b9hWihDs This video never went viral?
<StuffCrusader> ugh... chat's getting boring. there;s nothing streaming. gonna leave soon if nothing intersting happens.
<Cypresswolf> :3 We need another Ross Perot - those charts of his were very informative :P
<Time> I'm eating grits for dinner. :P
<fluttercry> 05,15Ross Perot was awesome
<hen3ry> No, his veep was awesome. Dude turned his hearing aid off during the Veep debate.
<hen3ry> Smartest play in political history.
<Cypresswolf> Were I old enough at the time I might have voted Perot, but alas 7 is too young :D
<Tovoted> WHAAA- oh 1% for South Carolina
<fluttercry> 05,15Lol there's a commercial on slamming socialism.
<Time> Anything gonna stream soon? :$
<spight> Saturn, most of us are actually very resilient to the call of the bronies.
<evilzebra> Is the stream not working?
<spight> I'm trying to turn them all, though.
<naturesfury> i hear halo4 came out today.... gogo mods
<Ryunosuke> socialism isnt bad
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hai guys, wassup?
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: I was in elementary school when Ross Perot ran against Bush/Clinton and we had to give presentations about one of the candidates. The teacher ended up having to assign people to do Bush and Clinton because everyone wanted to do Perot
<Mutterguy> Socialism is grreat!

<DoctoDoctorWho> Midnight_Fyre: she still qualifies as a backround pony, as does octavia.
<fluttercry> 05,15Applejack was a background pony in her own episode
<sonicdude558> when I finish Halo 3
<sonicdude558> or
<sonicdude558> if I get a XIM 3 :3
<Phase4> also steam for linux, released today
<Phase4> closed beta,
<Phase4> is good day to be giant nerd

<LadyCanary> Hello Shizu ^_^ ooh, did you hear the news?
<Shizuka> 13news?
<pony_054496> neighbox360 or neighstation 3
<DoctoDoctorWho> I for one have nothing against Luna, but if war broke out I'd side with celestia.
<Phase4> Shizuka, check your email, also aparently you should 'recive a bag' if you;re in the beta
<RoboGerbil> celestia would win me over
<RoboGerbil> molestia is bestia
<DoctoDoctorWho> RoboGerbil: /)
<LadyCanary> Xiaolin Showdown is coming back, Shizu :33
<Tovoted> Celestia vs Angry Sun from SMB3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 linux beta started ?
<Shizuka> 13ooo
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, just now
<Phase4> like hours ago
<Phase4> also theres 26 games in the beta now, not just l4d2
<GilDash> The BBC need to stop wasting money on these infographics. They're horrible. :S
<Shizuka> 13i bet i won't get a invite in the first wave cause i took the survey from asuka, who is windows :3
<RoboGerbil> who wants someone who wears dark colors and moons you all the time.. thenyells whenever she tanks
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 and what is dis bag you talk about ?
<Phase4> Shizuka, i was in windows at the time also, doubt they count that though
<Shizuka> 13is k
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, no idea
<NullRadix> Shizuka: wouldn't they want people who use windows? They need to make the transition easy
<Shizuka> 13i'm not on laptop enough to quite need it at least
<DoctoDoctorWho> has anyone seen Hellsing Ultimate Abridged ep 3 yet?
<Phase4> 60k responses, so 1/60 chance
<Shizuka> 13and integrated graphics means i can play like three games from my library >>
<Phase4> dual boot
<Shizuka> 13not on asuka .-.
<Phase4> is best way to play games, at least until the beta opens
<Shizuka> 13need mah disk space

<DoctoDoctorWho> or desktops
<Bronysith> YAAAAY gangnam style
<Phase4> DoctoDoctorWho, uh... super computers can't do real time tasks like video games
<Lunar_Brony> Desktop computers FTW
<Midnight_Fyre> weeping_pegasi82: I like to listen to them back to back
<Phase4> DoctoDoctorWho, i meen you could probably make them do it with dificulty, even then though you cant split the games workload across numa nodes
<weeping_pegasi82> Midnight_Fyre: me too :P
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)

<Midnight_Fyre> Looks shopped
<DoctoDoctorWho> MakerDusk: and where are you from?
<Buytoast> what kind of ballot is that?
<Shizuka> 13probably varies by county but for us romney was on top (usually the incumbent is on top), then obama, then johnson, then the rest
<weeping_pegasi82> a song about Discord (not LivingTombstone version) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFZ5FVDj2kU&feature=channel&list=UL
<Buytoast> my ballot had us filling in arrows
<Tovoted> :( This Week in Blackness is a few minutes late. I wonder why...
<Midnight_Fyre> Now I'm regretting more than ever that I didn't write in Derpy
<Saturn> 08,01okay, admit it, who drew a rainbow dash to spoil their ballot?
<fluttercry> 05,15Seeing as Rosanne is on that list, I'd say shopped
<MakerDusk> Buytoast: I have no clue which state that one is from
<Shizuka> 13that and we had like ten judges running unopposed
