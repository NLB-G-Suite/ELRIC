<Biglaw> *falls off of wall into Mongolia* See ya kid!

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai SuperBrony64

<FlareChaser|NotDrunk> Ghosties: lolwut, I know...Jackie...4chan you mean.
<Wrek> 05hes getting a bit old though
<Tov|TakeTheWheel> You know. This movie doesn't suck.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Does anyone remember that Jackie Chan cartoon?
<Kandarihu> Yup. The essential part of the training montage is for him to fail at something at first, then win epically at it later on.
<Sumica> 00,10dat wood
<DocSane> No fun for you, Meiling.
<otakon> or did her parents blame Dre?
<Deadlypon3> Wrek Jackie Chan NEVER get's old

<Steve_Charb> I don't think they slapped the Karate Kid title on a different script though
<RAWRity> Steve_Charb: it's same plot to a point. But the overall tone of the events, the characters, and dynamics and between them are very different.

<Sumica> 00,10nice dress
<SunderlandPony89> Steve_Charb: Still, it just aint fair judging it by the original. It's like judging a movie adaptation of a book by comparing it to the movie
<SlurryMoon> 3Lecho, is that yours? It looks very nice :3
<Azuredragon> !" Jackie chan : bitch please.
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Before the tournament, Han (Jackie Chan) gives Dre (Jaden Smith) a shirt to compete in. Dre comments that the shirt is just like one that Bruce Lee wore. One of Jackie Chan's early breaks in movies was to be a stunt coordinator in Lee's films; Chan also had small parts in Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon.

<RAWRity> Miyagi was very much the old Mentor figure. he taught Daniel, and acted as a father. With Han, it's more akin to a brotherly relationship, since they both help eachother with their own struggles.

<SunderlandPony89> If Requium for a Dream gets through, then Hobo with a Shotgun should get through

<Ninjazz> Oh and yes, Reikim, I think it would be an A movie.

<Kandarihu|StrixorX> And, here's the part in BMN when I get tired.

<SunderlandPony89> Bronysith: Yeah. But still.
<DocSane> K_A: Go to Google and type coolie hat.
<Evil_Spike> This shall now be the standard for B movies
<Reikim> Ninjazz: Oh! Thanks. I put it down as a B-movie anyway, just to be sure. Used the precedent of Evil Dead.
<Barbetos> Oh. Of course the guy who survives is the best of the group.
<DocSane> Most of the stores selling them refer to them as such.
<Barbetos> Why can't it ever be the worst?
<SunderlandPony89> Hobo with a Shotgun for B movie
<SirGanjalf> ^
<GarrettBrony> I second that

<xXxSc00t_C0mm4nd0xXx> 00,03dat Ninja Pro
<Fenr> :D
<RAWRity> Basically, the US and Russia couldn't fight eachother, because both sides had enough nukes to blast the planet back into the stone age, and declaring war would mean destroying most of humanity. So instead, they passive-aggresively fought eachother through other skirmishes by supporting different sides in Viet Nam and Korea.

<otakon> Sumica: if only they showed that
<StinkomanFan> We screwed up, but that's to be expected
<Darkts33> there goes the entire budget
<RanYakumo> There goes a sixteenth of the film's budget.
<DocSane> And we're sure this isn't a comedy?
<Narolas> He is a constant speed moving target, that's so easy to hit !
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: The one that we're never gonna win

<Barbetos> Uuuhgaaahahah!
<Yankee> who taught these guys how to shot
<Darf14> Its like hitting a ant with a rock from 30 feet away
<StinkomanFan> AAAA

<CK|Ded> REB BROWN SCREAMS YES

<otakon> RanYakumo: and the first 15/16th's of it was on the opening scene
<DeathStar> Irish_Pony: bed guys can't aim you should know this
<Barbetos> So who picked this movie?

<Tov|ER> aiming at the exact spot he currently is didn't work for some reason
<Darf14> Group together, best tactical decision
<RAWRity> SunderlandPony89: more like we stuck our foot into a meat grinder, then undercooked the resulting meat, ate it, and got explosive diarhea and botulism from the meal.
<Sumica> 00,10that guy is pro with the SAW
*Shirtless_Tempest puts his shirt back on

<Yankee> they didn't have SAW back then
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: Nam was fucked up.
<MrMaxaminus> LOL
<StinkomanFan> 19 and things like that

<StinkomanFan> I SUDDENLY CAN BACK
<Ninjazz> Sumi wasn't implying M249?
<Reikim> USSR supported Communist dictators, NATO supported capitalist dictators, either way you got dictators in power.

<sagas> They never return fire...

<Starlight_Phoenix> what happened to everybody else that he was trying to save?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> hup hup hup
<SunderlandPony89> Bronysith: It's also looking dark as hell in it's tone

<Alister> I wanna thank the Bronystate staff for forgiving me and I wanna apologize for acting like a prick before. I'm just so happy to talk to you wonderful people again
<Ninjazz> Tell me you didn't love that, though, TRD|ProCommando?

<pony_300> Reb Brown sings your greatest hits: RRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<RAWRity> Soul Eater is by-the-books Shonen filler.
<Reikim> StinkomanFan: Weird anime, eh? Like me! Try Panty and Stocking, FLCL, Nichijou, Madoka, Nanoha, and maybe Medaka
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Kill ALL the things!
<sagas> This guy has anger problems and it gets him in trouble

<Sock> He's gunna kill him
<CloverMuffins> this guy has PTSD. he should take some MDMA
<Ninjazz> TRD|ProCommando: You gotta let your primal urges wash over you and SCREAM, sometimes, Dashie.
<Kandarihuski> Okay. That symmetrical headbutt charge and Ransom screaming after throwing Jakota off the cliff were wierd sights.
<StinkomanFan> I need to watch that
<Sock> if its the last thing he ever does.
<FillyFlam> fluttercry: He threw him off a waterfall.
<Princess_Molestia> Great
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I'm gonna kill him. Even if it kills me.

<Evil_Spike> Spoony did this
<RAWRity> Reikim: ew, Panty and Stocking
<otakon> First anime that really made me go "WTF" and tilt my head to it.
<Sumica> 00,10I am sure that's all that would have come up in a search if they had
<RX-78-SweetieBot> StinkomanFan: there is more than shounen fighting anime
<Darkts33> fluttercry: after a punch
<Reikim> FLCL: What happens if you give Gainax drugs. Meanwhile, Panty and Stocking: What happens when you give them ALL the drugs.

<otakon> and the dub isn't half bad either
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Manila
<Midnight_Fyre> There was a TV movie about the Rough Riders, which is the only movie I can think of from the Spanish American War

<RanYakumo> DeathStar: I am proud to say you have danced on my head. Now let us sing the song of our people.

The fillies are in various poses. The artwork relates to the foalhood of the ponies in the year 1037.

<TOY_PON32> DeathStar: I left for a bit lol
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> 1) The BEst Night Ever 2) Fallout Equestria....3) ummmm
<RAWRity> One of them actually becomes deluded, and attemtps to become a super hero, taking on the name "Genesis" and fighting the other competitors because he's convinced they're super villains.
<RAWRity> Reikim: sure
<DaringDude> i have had th e gurren lagan theme stuck in my head all day
<Reikim> Ah
<Gamer_Luna> geeky-brony, eeeyup :)
<DeathStar> TOY_PON32: i see
<CECtheRonin> Ninjazz Never heard of that one.
<Reikim> Are you done?
*Celes_Chere has a lovely bunch of cocunuts
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I'm liking the idea, RAWRity
<RAWRity> yes
<geeky-brony> eeeeyup
<CloverMuffins> 1) I don't 2) Read 3) Fanfics
<Reikim> It's a great idea.
<sagas> The long-ass one with nix or something
<Ninjazz> CECtheRonin: Then you know what you must do.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>Calvinball
<TOY_PON32> 1) why are you reading this?
<Reikim> In place of Genesis, though, you could use something else that signifies "The End".
<Ninjazz> sagas: Past Sins? :S
<geeky-brony> dis badass pic i found http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/#/d51z2t0 Gamer_Luna
<CECtheRonin> Paladin_Drakkenwolf Both of those are good.
<Kencolt> The Moonstone Cup, It takes a Village, and Arrow 18: Mission Logs.
<CupcakeWarrior> dat Tov|Calvinball
<DeathStar> TOY_PON32: because you wrote it
<Reikim> Genesis has too many positive connotations, unless you're goign to use it.
<CECtheRonin> Ninjazz Where can i find it?
<Reikim> Anyway, my idea.
<Somebronyyayz> Madagascar In a nutshell Hey everyone a VIRUS THAT DOES NOTHING will get into our country shut down everthing
<sagas> Ninjazz: Yes! Never had the stamina to finish it through though
<Ninjazz> CECtheRonin: FIMfiction.net
<RAWRity> Well, that's the point.
<TOY_PON32> DeathStar: Erm..I guess your right lol
<Reikim> Ah, I see.
<RAWRity> He thinks he's a superhero
<DaringDude> blarg soo tired from being in the sun all day
<RAWRity> plus, I figured "Genesis" would fit thematically with the powers of creation.
*DeathStar noms popcorn "I love the buffershow <3"
<Reikim> Cool. Anyway, idea is great. Go for it.
<Gamer_Luna> This is adorable :) http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/#/d520zb9
<RAWRity> cool.
<TOY_PON32> DaringDude: Ooo getting your tan on bro?
<RAWRity> Now let's here yours.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01shines on DaringDude
<Everlasting_Joy> DaringDude: I hear ya on that one.
<TOY_PON32> Burn him!
<DaringDude> i dont like being burned
<TOY_PON32> Hey Everlasting_Joy :D
<Reikim> I had an idea for an MLP fanfic one day. Randomly dropped into my head with the phrase "all the colours of the rainbow".
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy TOY_PON32!
<CloverMuffins> DeathStar: I know, right? It spins and spins and spins and spins and spins...
<Darf14> WOW!! ....that pick is adorable :)
*DaringDude puts on some Nittany_Discord Screen
<CECtheRonin> DaringDude Me neither.
<geeky-brony> Gamer_Luna: =_(\
<Reikim> This little plot bunny gathered into something rather nice.
<sagas> Gamer_Luna: Ha Ha. I like gridmark and all but come on. That is nothing
<DaringDude> luckily im quite tan already so only my face burns
<CECtheRonin> I'm actually afraid of being burned, especially after the last cooking incident.
<Reikim> The story follows a painter, a student at the Equestrian Royal Academy of the Arts in Canterlot
<Everlasting_Joy> TOY_PON32: What's new with you? It's been a while since you've been on here.
<Reikim> In order to ascend to the rank of master, he is given a test.
<TOY_PON32> DaringDude: Careful bro you don't want to get skin cancer
<DeathStar> CloverMuffins: you should see season 2 I don't wanna spoil anything but the dots spin
<Reikim> He is to paint the vaguely-defined "essence" of a pony.
<CloverMuffins> DeathStar: holy sh*t! nowai!! :O
<DualShock> CloverMuffins: soz youtube wasn't working, could you give me that link again?
<RAWRity> he fails and is sent back to Art Kindergarten
<DeathStar> CloverMuffins: ikr?
<DaringDude> yeah i think i burn my face way to much i might get it :/
<Reikim> So he's shipped to Ponyville, given some money and as much time as he likes to complete the assignment.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Guys...I gotta go.
<Darf14> bye Silverscreen
<Reikim> Initially he panics, but then sets down to do it.
<DaringDude> i should stop with all this water polo not helpful with the sunburn dilema
<DeathStar> bye Silverscreen
<Everlasting_Joy> Aww. . . Take care Silverscreen.

<WallDives> bye Silverscreen. later.
<Aircrafter> Hi Everybrony. How is everyone on this HORRIBLE night?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everyone. If you want to help me with something (financially) I want to get for our next fundraiser (it's in the newsletter), PM me. I would super-appreciate some help. I only need a $150 max.
<Reikim> He needs a subject, though. Somebody simple, but not dull. Colours without depth, to make his job easier.
<CECtheRonin> Aircrafter Well-fed and heartbroken.
<Aircrafter> TOY_PON32: Oh not much. I've read too many creepypastas so I can't get any sleep.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So I can help raise $2,250 for others.
<CloverMuffins> Aircrafter: why horrible?
<sagas> DeathStar: I am, but Im also getting impacient
<RAWRity> Then he says "buck it" and just draws R34 ponies on the internet
<Reikim> Of course Rainbow Dash flies by, right at that moment.
<CupcakeWarrior> Derpy?
<TOY_PON32> Aircrafter: Wow
<Aircrafter> CloverMuffins: Cause I owe Slenderman 20 dollars.
<TOY_PON32> Everlasting_Joy: Thanks
<sagas> DeathStar: Oh well. Chat is good enough for me
<Reikim> From there, I would use this viewpoint to investigate Rainbow Dash's character.
<Aircrafter> CECtheRonin: Thats good.
<cachi01|MW3> hi Aircrafter a horrible night to have a curse right?
<RAWRity> I like it.
<WallDives> If I have any money this month that I can throw at you, I will Nitt.
<DualShock> CloverMuffins: thankyou muchly :)
<CloverMuffins> Aircrafter: oh u fk'd :d
<Aircrafter> So true cachi01|MW3.
<CloverMuffins> DualShock: npnp :)
<Reikim> It's kind of an in-depth character study of Dash.
<CECtheRonin> Aircrafter Heartbroken is... good? 6_9
*DeathStar dances on sagas s head "yay ^-^"
<Aircrafter> Currently he won't let me take a pee till I give him his money.
<TOY_PON32> Gotta have my daily dose of creepypasta now
<TrollTerrorist> HELLO!
<cachi01|MW3> Aircrafter: lol i remember y first creepypasta night... its freaking scary xd
<Aircrafter> CECtheRonin: Yes. Cause I no have a heart >:3
<DeathStar> hello TrollTerrorist
<RAWRity> It's an interesting way to explore and break down one of the Mane 6's characters, while offering a unique viewpoint on it.
<geeky-brony> DeathStar: why so awesome
<TrollTerrorist> I'M A TROLL TERRORIST!
<CECtheRonin> What's creepypasta?
<Solargirl> Oooooh are we talking about Creepy pasta? Also, hi there people.
<sagas> creepypasta?
<TOY_PON32> TrollTerrorist: I can see that o.o
<TrollTerrorist> BYE
<Ninjazz> Hello Solargirl.
<CECtheRonin> Aircrafter Are you a Vorcha?
<Ninjazz> TrollTerrorist... welcome.
<Gamer_Luna> DO NOT GO TO CREEPYPASTA,YOUNG FILLY!
<DeathStar> geeky-brony: /)^3^(\ i dunno
<Reikim> At the same time I make a point regarding people in general: that no matter how simple they appear, all people are far too complex to properly express in a single picture, sentence, word, whatever.
<TOY_PON32> Um ok lol
<geeky-brony> lol
<Aircrafter> CECtheRonin: You know the term, "Well I wasn't planning on sleeping tonight anyway, or Nightmarefuel"?
<sagas> Why not, Gamer_Luna
<CloverMuffins> I desire to watch more ponies. I DEMAND PONIES. Youtube is waiting...
<geeky-brony> but Gamer_Luna
<Aircrafter> CECtheRonin: No. I AM A COLLECTOR!!!
<RAWRity> It can explore and address a lot of the fandom's on perceptions on Rainbow, while letting such references feel natural and organic.
