<Java> LadyCanary sounds like a superhero name
<NocturnalBlade> Sumica: agreed
<LadyCanary> Java: Funny you should say that!
<Java> it is?
<LadyCanary> Black Canary is my favorite DC superhero.
<Ponies47> Pardon me as I go draw something~
<NocturnalBlade> LadyCanary: was about to say that lol
<LadyCanary> So that's how I got the name LadyCanary.
<TheBatman> Like, I know that Sandyd's is the name, but the server isn't public or something :(
*Ponies47 searchs for a MLP princess base
<Java> Black Canary is always awesome character. good thing DC don't screw her character yet
<LadyCanary> I KNOW Java :OOO
<NocturnalBlade> Java: yet
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Go for a Celestia princess base. :3
<Java> NocturnalBlade: yet >:)
<LadyCanary> Gail Simone is the only writer I will trust with her. Among others.
<fr4nky> maybe the server is friends only
<Ponies47> Nah. I was kidding AJIsAwesome. I'm just messing around =P
<TheBatman> fr4nky: D:
<TheBatman> fr4nky: then how did that kid get on there?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: okay. jpg
<NocturnalBlade> fr4nky: its full
<Ponies47> I'm a silly pony~ :3
<fr4nky> but it wasnt on the list then it wasnt full
<Java> So who will play Dark Souls 2 in their PaniniStation?
<LadyCanary> But I cant be a princess, Sumica. Wreky is best princess. ]:3/
<NocturnalBlade> well im looking at the players in the game and its full
<TheBatman> LadyCanary: As Record_Discord, I remember that.

<Ponies47> TheBatman: Then what's one of them?
<TheBatman> Ponies47: Mods have authority.
<Java> I remember a Brony who made wooden automaton of Fluttershy that sold for 1300 bucks
<Ponies47> You took way to long to type that. Case closed you didn't read them TheBatman
<TheBatman> Ponies47: Oh yeah? Don't troll.
<TheBatman> THERE, THAT'S A RULE
<Ponies47> Ok. How many times have you been told to stop the canterlock. Multiple and yet you still don't do it~
<Ponies47> *do it
<TheBatman> Ponies47: Fine, no more Canterlock. I dare you to try to break the capslock disease. It requires several years of therapy
<Ponies47> Just follow the rules and you'll be fine~
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Ponies47> If you don't
<Ponies47> Your gonna have a bad time
<TheBatman> Ponies47: Look, I can make tildes too ~~~~ T~T
<NocturnalBlade> can the both of you calm down, Ponies47 if he wants to break rules let the mods handle it :)
<TheBatman> I can also reference memes. Fuck me right?
<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade: I'm not fighting silly pony :3

<NocturnalBlade> twilight_sprinkle: its better with 4 people lol
<Blazing_Beatz> fr4nky: I am in the game, which one is it?
<Java> I just found a diaper store called "Poopee Whoopee"

<Java> TheBatman: you drunk my island!

<TheBatman> Java: That's a fuckin' good milkshake
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: Nah. I know all the mods want me gone. So I might make it were I'm surrounded by them and all of them are holding ban hammers~
<Java> TheBatman: I know ;)
<Sumica> 00,10if you are meleeing the giant robots you are dumb and dead
<TheBatman> Java: Oh wait, we already did this, din't we?
<Buytoast> if you are missing the giant robot
<Java> yep

<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I'm sure they don't want you gone. ._.
<Java> But this time with my waifu :p
<TheBatman> Java: Lunaismywaifu.

<Ponies47> Being a silly pony as always :3
*Kipkat07_Scarf noms a slim jim like a fatass
*TheBatman noms a Kipkat07_Scarf like a fat fuck
<Ponies47> No chat derping! DX
<fr4nky> slim jim? what that?
<Java> If there's Slim Jim then why is there no Fat Jam?
<TheBatman> fr4nky: Think of it like this... It's a stick of assorted animal parts stuffed into a skin. Tastes like Murica.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> fat american food
<Ponies47> Whoever started PMing me. Send me another message
<AJIsAwesome> Egh, I never licked Slim Jim.
<AJIsAwesome> *liked
<TheBatman> AJIsAwesome: I could never lick them myself either... Although I don't really like them either.
<fr4nky> i havent tasted this because im not from america
<Kipkat07_Scarf> mmmm cildhood obesity....
<AJIsAwesome> fr4nky: Don't bother. They're not that tasty.
<TheBatman> fr4nky: Obviously. Every 'Murican knows what they are.
<Java> I'm not American, but I think i will pass that "Slim Jim"
<Kipkat07_Scarf> tastes like blood clots
<Java> No thank you
<TheBatman> Source: I'm Murican. I want to move to Canada.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I wanna move to the UK
<Java> Kipkat07_Scarf: are you sure?
<Mozdoc> What does the tape recorder machine do?
<Java> sapper
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: http://underpable.deviantart.com/art/Philomena-342485719
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Java: Positive
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Brony 101: Leaving the Fandom
<Java> Kipkat07_Scarf: good luck then
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, twilight_sprinkle. I like it. :)
<Kipkat07_Scarf> my only problem is that I want to join the USAF
<fr4nky> Kipkat07_Scarf: whats USAF?
<TheBatman> United States of America Force
<fr4nky> thx
<Kipkat07_Scarf> United States Air Force
<Ponies47> My dad was in the Air force Kipkat07_Scarf.
<twilight_sprinkle> why do you want to joing the air force if you hate america
<Kipkat07_Scarf> mine was in the army and air force
<Java> Ok I love that latest EQD article
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Java> I still wonder why people always saying "Leaving the fandom" over the most trivial matter
<Java> Just watch and enjoy the damn show!
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I hate modern american culture. I dont hate the country, I hate what the its becoming. I want to live in 1950, when everything is good
<fr4nky> i think i wont leave it ever
<Java> Every era has its downside
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> its not just america thats going downhill
<Java> Trust me, the 50s are not better
<twilight_sprinkle> its the whole world
<Kipkat07_Scarf> YOU CANT LEAVE. YOU ARE HERE FOR LIFE.
<fr4nky> in the 50s there where no ponies
<AJIsAwesome> Kipkat07_Scarf: Then why don't you try helping making this country a btter place if you don't like it?
<AJIsAwesome> Living in the past does not solve the situation.
<AJIsAwesome> *better
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: huh? i know plenty of people who left america without a problem
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Java: better than dubstep, unnecessary nudity, douches, etc?
<twilight_sprinkle> its a lot harder getting in than out
<Java> It's us vs the world, always. Either you lose, or you say to the world "FUCK YOU! I'M A MAN AND I'M PROUD OF IT!"
<TheBatman> I'M A MAN, AND I'M PROUD OF IT
<twilight_sprinkle> >dubstep
<Java> Kipkat07_Scarf: Douches exist all the time
<twilight_sprinkle> really Kipkat07_Scarf? dubstep is a crime?
<AJIsAwesome> Kipkat07_Scarf: This stuff isn't JUST in America, you know.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> not necessarily, but still. I hate the modern world as a whole
<Java> Kipkat07_Scarf: You prefer to live in an era where showing a little cleavage will brand somegirl a whore?
<TheBatman> Kipkat07_Scarf: We all do. Come away with me and my friends to a small, uninhabited island.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> hmmm... yeah
<TheBatman> Java can come too
<AJIsAwesome> Kipkat07_Scarf: So why don't you do something to change it?
<TheBatman> cowvarkian
<Java> This era is good, racism are lower and we actually living in better life standard
<TheBatman> AJIsAwesome: You're invited
<twilight_sprinkle> eyjey said golden words
<twilight_sprinkle> people today blame the world and do nothing about it
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Unless we can get a country to convert to ponyism I doubt the world can improve
<twilight_sprinkle> they act as though its evil and has nothing to do with them
<Java> true that twilight_sprinkle
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I AM AMERICAN. I AM AUTOMATICALLY LAZY.
<twilight_sprinkle> but the world wont change on its own
<AJIsAwesome> You know, people who complain about something and don't DO anything about it can practically be just as bad as the people who are CAUSING the problems.
<NocturnalBlade> bbl guys ^_^
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Im not going to be able to make an impact
<Ponies47> Laters NocturnalBlade ^_^
<AdamTheDuck> Bye NocturnalBlade
<twilight_sprinkle> moving to a different conuntry wont change the world, neither will it be better
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: climat :3
<twilight_sprinkle> bye NocturnalBlade
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, NocturnalBlade.
<Mutterguy> hi all
<Kipkat07_Scarf> *e
<Ponies47> Hi Mutterguy :3
<AJIsAwesome> Running from the problem doesn't help you, it just makes it worse.
<twilight_sprinkle> well,i would probably prefer britains weather too, but still
<Java> Kipkat07_Scarf: you can kip, everyone help
*Kipkat07_Scarf gives up and goes back to his corner mumbling about the past
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: and even if you cant make an impact from above, then do so from below
<Kipkat07_Scarf> kick the world in the dick?
<twilight_sprinkle> ...no
<Kipkat07_Scarf> awww
<Java> Kipkat07_Scarf: If we need to.
<Java> tough love baby
<twilight_sprinkle> i mean if you dont plan to go into politics and make an impact there, make an impact is an ordinary citizen, for individual lives
<twilight_sprinkle> *as
<Mutterguy> I'm no Xenobiogeologist but i don't think the World has a dick.
<twilight_sprinkle> and with the internet its easier to get your thoughts out too
<Java> Gaia is a she
<TheBatman> twilight_sprinkle: Get our thoughts out... Fuck the police! I do what I WANT!
<AJIsAwesome> You must act within the boundaries of society in order for people to understand your ideals, instead of just forcing it onto them.
<TheBatman> AJIsAwesome: Tell that to Jehovah Witnesses or Mormons...
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Well... I could blow up Mount Everest. People would notice me then, and I could theoretically kick the world in the dick
<Java> Reminds me about the latest Fox News blaming the recent shooting on video games.
<Java> Again
<Tyler_The_Creator> The taste of wine is getting easier and easier to drink.
<Tyler_The_Creator> take*
<TheBatman> Java: AGAIN.
<Java> TheBatman: AGAIN
<Mutterguy> Not on guns?
<TheBatman> Java: AND AGAIIIN
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Mutterguy: Remember me?
<TheBatman> Mutterguy: Guns don't kill people, mentally damaged people kill people.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> yep
<AJIsAwesome> Instead of complaining about the problems, we should be finding ways to fix them.
<twilight_sprinkle> guns dont kill people, people dont kill people, loss of blood and damage to organs kills people
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Blow shit up?
<twilight_sprinkle> ...yes, blow shit up
<TheBatman> twilight_sprinkle: None of those things kill people. Joss Wheden kills people.
<Mutterguy> Kipkat07_Scarf vaguely
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Assasinate dictators?
<fr4nky> because games make you run amok -.-
<Java> Done that. Not effective
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Declare war on the ocean?
<twilight_sprinkle> it doesnt have to involve murder or destroying anything
<Mutterguy> welll more than vaguely but there is an quite of crowd here
<TheBatman> fr4nky: Remember Legend Of Zelda? That game made me lose my shit. I chopped up a couple of plants.
<Java> Kipkat07_Scarf: Done that too, not effective
<Kandarihu> Guys, it seems that Kotaku jumped the gun on accusing Fox News of playing the "murder simulators" card.
<Java> Geh Kotaku
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Kill the hippies?
<twilight_sprinkle> like i said, just set good morals for yourself and set an example for others, and help others with their lives and morals
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Java> The hive of scum and villainy
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Tried that
<TheBatman> SHIT SHE'S DEAD
<twilight_sprinkle> and if someone doesnt behave like you want, you mustnt give up either, and keep going
<Java> Kotaku used to be good until Brian Crecente leave. Then it went to shit.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> OH! I KNOW!! Kill all the profane rappers!!
<TheBatman> Kipkat07_Scarf: that'll work
<TheBatman> Kipkat07_Scarf: but not Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, those guys are the SHIT.
<AJIsAwesome> Java: There's always hope that it'll be better.
<Java> AJIsAwesome: I hope so.
<Buytoast> Kotaku was always terrible
<Kipkat07_Scarf> or we could censor everything
<Java> AJIsAwesome: I need to be more positive
<Off> There must be something wrong with my headphones, because I can't hear a thing from this video.
<AJIsAwesome> I wouldn't give up on Kotaku (if I was interested enough to like it). There's always a chance that it'll be better.
<Buytoast> they've had a chance to get better since the day they started
<Buytoast> and they haven't improved so far
<twilight_sprinkle> Off: do you hear this ping?
<Java> I prefer staying in Polygon for now
<Off> no
<AJIsAwesome> I'd wait until Kotaku officially retires before giving up on it.
<fr4nky> can you hear system sounds Off ?
<twilight_sprinkle> Off: is your computer muted maybe?
<Off> hmm, possibly. I'd better check the control panel.
<Java> AJIsAwesome: Did you post in Kotaku? what's your handle there?
<Phase4> 00,02ooo, there a spot avaliabe in the game?
<Phase4> 00,02aww, no spots
<AJIsAwesome> Java: I don't go to Kotaku. I'm just usuing it as an example.
<TheBatman> Fuck it, I don't even watn to play
<AJIsAwesome> *using
<Java> AJIsAwesome: oh ok
<Ponies47> Dat Phase4 O3O

<AdamTheDuck> Combat medic is best medic \:3/
*Kipkat07_Scarf is unsure of what to do
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, that did work well
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: They've done a 6 Scout game here.
<DerpyMuffins> HAHA
<DerpyMuffins> I luv to see that
<Phase4> 00,02backstab a robot
<TheBatman> Musta been hard as shat
<Ponies47> Sumica: We tried that before. Remember?
<AJIsAwesome> Nah, they didn't have that much trouble with it.
<DerpyMuffins> You rarely see a spy in MvM
<TheBatman> You really rarely do.
<DerpyWhooves> OHMYGODITSTEAMFORTRESS2

<Phase4> 00,02tried it on one of the normal modes iirc
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: How did it go?
<Ponies47> Sumica: That was great when did all Medics
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: We failed! XD
<Phase4> 00,024 heavys, piss sniper and engi would also be fun to try

*Kipkat07_Scarf repeatedly punches his cat
<Ponies47> To bad none of those guys have high five taunts :/
*AdamTheDuck repeatedly licks Kipkat07_Scarf
<DashWithRainbows> It's because it is rare to get in a crate or you have to pay £5 for it.

<TheBatman> I feel so special
<Blazing_Beatz> Yes, you should...cause I said goodnight to you

<Blazing_Beatz> eh, idk
<TheBatman> Like... Kipkat07_Scarf? Or Java?
<TheBatman> Tell them I wished them a good night.
<TheBatman> Meh.
<Blazing_Beatz> k
<Blazing_Beatz> lol
<Kipkat07_Scarf> night
<Java> huh? whazzat?
<Java> :p
<NickyB> indeed
<Java> it's noon here
*Bronysith takes Kipkat07_Scarf to bed
<Java> It seems like most American already went to bed
*Kipkat07_Scarf squees
<Kandarihu> I haven't
<Java> I know
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Java: neither have I
<Java> You replied tome
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I don't go to bed until after the sun rises.
<Buytoast> MURIKA never sleeps.
<Java> Soulless_DCLXVI: being a vampire suck?
<NickyB> my foot is asleep, does that count?
<Buytoast> We always watch over the world, ensuring Communism doesn't try any funny buisiness.
<Blazing_Beatz> im the last of the MURICAINS to sleep
<Ponies47> I'm only 15. So I'm young and stupid and have lotsa energy :>
<Blazing_Beatz> along with a few others
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Java nice pun there. And I wouldn't know :)
<Java> Soulless_DCLXVI: At least you're not Twilight's vampire :p
<Blazing_Beatz> SO thats what its saying...Sex Robot
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Yeah. That WOULD suck.
<NickyB> :O these ponified emoticons make me smile
<Java> Who made them?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Damn that metal on metal clang is annoying.
<Blazing_Beatz> no
*Kipkat07_Scarf cant stay up till past 0000 or he will pass out
<Blazing_Beatz> thats the pings telling you got a hit
<Blazing_Beatz> But yeah, it gets annoying when playing MvM
<Blazing_Beatz> Still it helps you see damage and if you hit someone
<Blazing_Beatz> in pings
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Anyway to lower the volume of the ping or change the sound entirely?
<Blazing_Beatz> you can lower the stream volume
<Soulless_DCLXVI> No, I mean for those playing the game.
<Blazing_Beatz> not sure
<Blazing_Beatz> never really looked
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I find it difficult to believe that TF2 is really popular if hitting enemies with bullets results in physical pain.
<Blazing_Beatz> thats only if you have the ping selected
<Blazing_Beatz> its avaliable to be turned off
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I have to go sleepies :3
<Kipkat07_Scarf> nighty
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Oh. So you can turn it off? Allright, that's good.
<Ponies47> Nighty night then Kipkat07_Scarf
<Java> night Kipkat07_Scarf
<Soulless_DCLXVI> 'Night Kipkat07_Scarf
*Bronysith joins Kipkat07_Scarf in bed
<NickyB> good night and all that jazz
<Java> sexy time?
<Bronysith> Java: hell yea
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Bronysith: I didn't know you swung that way.
<Blazing_Beatz> yeah, you dont have to have the ping for damage, its only there for if you want to know if you hir something
<Bronysith> Soulless_DCLXVI: love is blind my friend
<Soulless_DCLXVI> True
<Java> until you hit a wall :p
*Bronysith grinds Java
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Ponu up :)
<Soulless_DCLXVI> -_-
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Pony*
<NickyB> ponies up, mules down
<Blazing_Beatz> face down, plot up
<Java> So many QWERTY typos. I wonder who here use AZERTY (not me)
<Soulless_DCLXVI> So is this PvP or PvE?
<Blazing_Beatz> MvM
<Goldframe> it's a pve system
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I'm unfamiliar with "MvM"
<Goldframe> as opposed to the normal pvp deathmatch thats in tf2
<Blazing_Beatz> MvM is Man vs. Machine
<Java> Mann
<Blazing_Beatz> yeah
<Blazing_Beatz> always forget that extra n
<Soulless_DCLXVI> So PvE then. Why make up a new, more confusing acronym?
<Java> More fun that way?
<Goldframe> because it's TF2 and MvM is the only PVE system thats in the game
<Goldframe> excluding the training
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Oh oh OH! The AI are all modeled after robots and unmanned vehicles. I see.
<Blazing_Beatz> Lol, thats why its called Mann vs. Machine
<Kandarihu> Soulless_DCLXVI, indeed.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I can see why the ping would make sense then.
<Blazing_Beatz> no..the pinging is for anything
<DerpyMuffins> So close
<Blazing_Beatz> I use the damage ping in any gamemode
<twilight_sprinkle> http://daughter-of-fantasy.deviantart.com/art/Happy-Hearth-s-warming-eve-unicorns-342891788
<Kandarihu> Soulless_DCLXVI, the ping also takes affect when hitting humans in normal mode.
<Goldframe> damage ping is good, especially if you're running a sniper or engie
<Java> twilight_sprinkle: What with Twilight "come tither" eyes?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Allright then.
<Blazing_Beatz> Yeah, The Ping is used to tell you if a weapon of yours is hitting someone, and to show how much damage is being done
<twilight_sprinkle> Java: *shrug*
<twilight_sprinkle> http://daughter-of-fantasy.deviantart.com/art/gamer-luna-fan-art-2nd-contest-325416528?q=gallery%3Adaughter-of-fantasy%2F31030962&qo=16

<the_real_pony_1604> yes, I could go for some wrek arts
<gdlk_ouo> aw, i can watch this bear forever
*eraykaan quest: do a barrel roll
<soulero> I just need that... juicy... wonderful.... stream key
<gdlk_ouo> so many damn hackers in ps2
<soulero> JUMP
<Phase4> 00,02hmm, my suspension appears to have stability problems
<eraykaan> QUEST COMPLETED!
<soulero> gdlk_ouo: not that many hackers bro
<soulero> gdlk_ouo: just good players
<the_real_pony_1604> and after all that you STILL can't open the truck
<the_real_pony_1604> trunk
<eraykaan> simon says jump
<gdlk_ouo> really i just saw how peoples start dying for no reason in place where they really can't
<soulero> what is sumi trying to do?
<eraykaan> idk
<Wrek> 05a spawn room?
<soulero> gdlk_ouo: team killing? infiltrators?
<eraykaan> dat sound is so sexy
<Wrek> 05did the base flip to an opposing faction?
<soulero> or what wrek said
<gdlk_ouo> no it was ours
<gdlk_ouo> and no enemy infs there
<Wrek> 05ive played the game since early beta
<Wrek> 05ive seen 1 hacker in all that time
<soulero> gdlk_ouo: team killing probably
<Wrek> 05and i got him banned
<eraykaan> i want my brainless stream back. what did i said?
<Ponies47> I was playing TF2 the other day and this guy was hacking like crazy ;_;
<linkkirby> lol
<Phase4> 00,02my car exploded when i ran into the debris of a previous model XD
<RainbowPengy> thats the downside of shooting game, ppl cant handle losing so they turn to hack
<AdamTheDuck> oh mornin' Wrek :P
<Ponies47> Click it or ticket Sumica ;3;
<linkkirby> whats hte plus sign next your name mean phase4?
<gdlk_ouo> maybe is something just was a render problem then we did'n see some enemies
<Phase4> 00,02linkkirby, voice, i can talk when the channel is muted
<soulero> virtually all actions in ps2 are ran through the server to check they are 'true', so youd have to be a hella skilled hacker to be able to kill the opposite team in there own spawn room
<linkkirby> oh ok
<gdlk_ouo> i recorded video if you give a fuck, i can't really say it was real hackers or just some bugs
<soulero> gdlk_ouo: what faction/server are you on?
<gdlk_ouo> miller
<gdlk_ouo> terran
<Wrek> 05soulero: i remember a glitch where on certain spawn buildings (this was before painfields) you could squeese yourself between 2 panels but you had to have a tank or sundy pressed agaisnt it
<Wrek> 05and voila
<Wrek> 05inside
<linkkirby> brb
<Phase4> 00,02this is totaly safe
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is the new Ace of Spades worth it?
<gdlk_ouo> but really i can't say it was real but it looks very strange then peoples just start dying around in room where no enemies units
<Ponies47> Sumica is the greatest fire fighter ever! :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> I also can't wait for Street Fighter x Mega Man
<RainbowPengy> i wonder if you call another will they come to you
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if you could sheer the truck betwene two trains
<gdlk_ouo> Wrek, also yes i saw yesterday gates that stand near 2 meters of earth and you can just go under them
<Ponies47> Sumica: take the train
<RainbowPengy> you will most likely lose your head

*AdamTheDuck holds up a cup of tea
*AdamTheDuck puts on a bowler hat with a fake moustache

<geeky> cold apple cyder is crap
<AppleBloom> AdamTheDuck: don't they charge though?
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah, $15 I think, can't remember
<AppleBloom> AdamTheDuck: 15$ or virus... weighing options here xD
<geeky> AFK
<Ponies47> If you pay for it I think it's worth it to be honest. It's worth it. It's 1000 times better than something like MS paint ^_^
<Buytoast> i thought SAI was 70 bucks
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it was defenatly noticeable to in the viewers numbers Ponies47 that the leak hurt us
<AppleBloom> Ponies47: I've been thinking about it, because for a hobby or side job whatever you wanna look at it. I design and paint guitars
<geeky> i use pint lol
<AppleBloom> Ponies47: So a program to edit and paint my idea's makes my life 10 times easy, rather than sketching and drawing by hand
<geeky> AppleBloom: i prefur sktch by hand
<Ponies47> Sumica: I stayed up way to late the night before and slept in and missed it ;_;
<AppleBloom> geeky: I do too, but for tri color paint jobs I can always sketch those
<Ponies47> AppleBloom: Yeah for something like that. Get it
<geeky> AppleBloom: ah most my art is hand drawn and colerd and or painted
<geeky> AppleBloom: u got a DA
<AppleBloom> Sumica: How big of a difference was the streams numbers compared to previous weeks?
<Sumica> 00,1050%
<AppleBloom> geeky: Nah, I am too mervous about posting my work on sites. Just hate getting crituqed by non customers lol
<AppleBloom> nervous*
<geeky> AppleBloom: ahh i got yah
<Ponies47> Sumica: Damn. Like I said. Hasbro needs to get there (squee) together T-T
<Buytoast> damn, i still have my shittiest stuff up on deviant art
<Buytoast> as a constant reminder of shame
<Ponies47> My art is junk but I'm trying to get better
<AppleBloom> Buytoast: My art is made out of wood, fire cleanses all lol
<geeky> Ponies47: lies its not junk
<geeky> AppleBloom: im suer its better than fire wood
<Buytoast> fire will never cleanse shame from our beings
<Buytoast> that's why we must always have some
<AppleBloom> geeky: meh, I tried to replicate van halen's guitar design... I slammed my thumb in a car door as punishment xD
<geeky> AppleBloom: o.... okay

<Chrysalis> <3 anneli heed
<Vordox> Lil_B: O.o What?

<Lil_B> Vordox It fit better with the Animation, but it's not noticable as long as you don't have the oiriginal Sprite standing really right next to her xD
*Vordox dodges it
<Vordox> I'll PM it
<Vordox> Lil_B: That unforgotten rule :D
<Chrysalis> hmm, wonder what would happen if i were to code a gák bomb, like a hug bomb, but with gák

<Vordox> Lil_B: It's the smart one
<Vordox> Lil_B: Having templates makes it easier
<Vordox> I don't use it though, I like each sprite being unique
<Lil_B> Vordox to her Popularity in Eurobe beeing as big as Tara is in America
<Vordox> None of the sprites I made are copied
<Vordox> Lil_B: Anneli started 1 and a half year after

<aniderp|bestcakeever> jaymoo ;_;
<Snow> XD
<Jmo> What do you want aniderp?
<artist> JAYMOOOOO!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> umm are you ok? D:
<Sparkle> oh
<Jmo> I'm fine, and what do you want artist?
<artist> hi
<Jmo> Yeah hello to you too.
<RaveBrony> :L
<Snow> Jmo, im suddenly curious. what does your OC look like? :P
<Jmo> I have no OC.
<Snow> :O
<MadSurge> ^^
<artist> go to bed
*aniderp|bestcakeever hugs jaymoo
<Kammerjunk> I don't see why you'd want an OC, anyway.
*Jmo huggles aniderp|bestcakeever
<aniderp|bestcakeever> my head hurts ;_;
<Dark92Enigma> my heart hurts
<Snow> its fun
<Kammerjunk> I mean, if you draw a lot or otherwise release a lot of stuff, I could understand, but most people don't.
<artist> mr widemouth
<Dark92Enigma> and it's because i cried at the top of my lungs
<Dark92Enigma> yesterday
<Zacklego> I have a question concerning the stream.
<Jmo> Oh boy here we go.
<Malavolent> Kammerjunk: But I NEED OC! I need black OC and I need to ship it with RD ASAP!
<Snow> Kammerjunk: when my tablet stops freaking out. i am going to start on my tumblr ask thingie
<Snow> so i do need one xD
<Dark92Enigma> Jmo: it's ok, you don't have to hear the whole story, and btw I'M. NOT. LEAVING. if that's what you think
<RaveBrony> I like OCs when theyre drawn, Using pony creator is just.... no, lol
<Kammerjunk> Malavolent: It also needs to have dragon wings and reptilian eyes.
<Kammerjunk> And a rainbow mane.
<artist> requesting to post non-picture material
<Kammerjunk> And, of course, be an alicorn.
<Jmo> I wasn't expecting you to leave.
<Gold_Demona> I like to use pony creator as a means to get together a color scheme and a basic design.
<Sparkle> who knows how to speak Russian?:)
<Kammerjunk> ...I can say about three words in Russian.
<Gold_Demona> That's how I came up with my OC. Once I had the basic design down I drew it from there.
<Snow> what is this pony creator thou speak of?
<Kammerjunk> That's a lie, about five.
<TheRandomkid321> My new computer can run skyrim on full graphical capabilitys fine but MINECRAFT the framerate drops lower than hell! Well that's what I have this old beauty for.
<artist> Wrek: requesting to post non-picture material
<Jmo> And not one shit was given.
<artist> indeed
<RaveBrony> Yup
<Kammerjunk> Minecraft requires more RAM than you'd expect, if I'm not mistaken.
<Wrek> 05gona BRB real quick
<Dark92Enigma> Jmo: oh, sorry.....my mistake........but you said: Oh, boy here we go......may i ask why?
<Wrek> 05gotta get soem lunch
<RaveBrony> Sweet! \o/
<Jmo> Minecraft only requires alot of RAM if you're hosting a server.
<TheRandomkid321> Well still it is a 2.5 thousand dollar computer.
<Rommulus> okie dokie Wrek
<Snow> pfft
<Rommulus> Have a good lunch
<Snow> minecraft and alot of RAM
<Snow> only when redstone
<Phase4> 00,02cant very well answer it if you dont ask :P
<Snow> i play it on high everything
<Rommulus> <3 doing redstone
<Snow> with 1GB RAM
<Sparkle> who of Severck?
<Snow> only when redstone i cant play
<Dark92Enigma> Jmo: oh, that was it :$
<Kammerjunk> Jmo: Then what does it take a lot of? I mean, it IS written in a language like Java.
<Sparkle> au?
<Jmo> Doesn't require alot of anything. It just depends on several things.
<Kammerjunk> Aha.
<Jmo> 1-2GB RAM, 512MB GPU, 2.4GHz~ CPU and you'll be fine playing Minecraft normally.
<Jmo> It's once you get more intensive into it you might require abit more of a system.
<Snow> does anyone have seen the picture of my oc how it is currently? the person who is drawing it for me gave me this update picture how it currently is
<Kammerjunk> Fair 'nuff.
<artist> requesting to post non-picture material!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Jmo> But hosting Minecraft servers, you need to feed them RAM.
<Sparkle> who know Russian?:$
<artist> omygod do i try"
<Zacklego> What tools were downloaded to produce such picture?
<artist> o my god do i pray
<Snow> anyone wanna see?
<Malavolent> Snow: Show me.
<artist> yes
<Snow> its not done yet http://i.imgur.com/UeLfz.png
<Malavolent> Yup, it's a OC.
<artist> wrek died
<Jmo> No shit.
<Rommulus> wrek went to get lunch
<Jmo> What'd you think it was gonna be?
<artist> oh
<artist> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4
<Malavolent> Jmo: <-- didn't get the joke.
<artist> hsit
<Jmo> I don't see anybody laughing.
<Gold_Demona> ha
<Snow> you risked a kick/ban for THAT vid?
<Snow> *facepalm*
<Malavolent> Jmo: You should look better.
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what you meen
<Jmo> I am looking.
<Phase4> 00,02oh, the drawing?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm actually elsewhere, not watching stream, Zacklego: i belive this is sai paint tool
<kurt> aww
<Malavolent> Jmo: Try opening your eyes while doing that.
<Snow> :D
<Jmo> My eyes are open and I still can't see anyone laughing.
<Jmo> So shit luck mate.
<Gold_Demona> Open your eyes and see... Your eyes are open...
<Snow> NO SHIT
<Gold_Demona> Wear no disguise for me... Come into the open...
<Malavolent> Jmo: Dunno how about you, but my eyes see that they're taking the hobbits to Isengard.
<Jmo> Pffft
<Gold_Demona> When it's cooooold... Outsiiiiiide.... Am I heeeeere... in vaaaaain!~
<kurt> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Uz1icjwrM
<Gold_Demona> That unallowed link
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: When there are no mods, who can punish you?
<Gold_Demona> I'm jsut sayin'...
<Gold_Demona> just*
<Malavolent> I know.
<Malavolent> Since when has the rules about links became so strict?
<Snow> he/she's just sayan
<Jmo> They always have been.
<Gold_Demona> ^
<Zacklego> i know the program but i would like to know what tools he uploaded into sai
<Malavolent> Well the mods never really banned everyone who dared to post a link.
<Jmo> They only kick people who do it, unless they spam the link.
<Jmo> Then they'll earn themselves a ban.
<Malavolent> Strange,
<Malavolent> I've never got kicked for that.
<Gold_Demona> Strange how? It's just courtesy
<Malavolent> Nevermind, a rule is a rule.
<Gold_Demona> yup
<Malavolent> Also, mods are asleep, post pony links.
<Gold_Demona> It's fine when there's no stream going on, but right now there is
<Snow> chat suddenly fell silent
<Gold_Demona> Yup

<Rex_Mundi> I take it rek was impressed by Spitfire in this episode. To tell the truth, I prefere the friendly laidback personality when shes not a flying instucter. I guess running a flight school/boot camp you have to put on a tough appearence.
<DerpyMuffins> Afternoon GilDash
<alexxm> hey guys

<_Dark_Moon_> She's just putting on the tough appearance for a flight instructor i guess
<alexxm> how've you been DerpyMuffins
<GilDash> She's got to be a hardass to keep the other cadets in line, obviously.
<Rex_Mundi> eah, her true personality is kind and laidback
<_Dark_Moon_> GilDash: agreed.
<DerpyMuffins> Alright you alexxm?
<GilDash> Problem is it seems like in the episode she had never met Rainbow Dash.
<BrightPage> IKR?!
<_Dark_Moon_> Ikr i thought that too
<GilDash> It's almost like they wrote the part for someone else and then went, "Hang on, let's use Spitfire."
<BrightPage> I said that exact same thing
<DerpyMuffins> She can't show favortism
<Rex_Mundi> GilDash: She cant treat Cadets she knows special
<alexxm> i'm good DerpyMuffins
<BrightPage> Yeah, but she can at least agknowlage them
<GilDash> DerpyMuffins: True, but she doesn't even acknowledge that they've met. I would have thought she would have brought it up after Dash stormed off..
<DerpyMuffins> WAit
<Gold_Demona> I didn't see anything odd about the way she acted. She was just being a drill sergeant.
<DerpyMuffins> Has it been 24 hours yet?
<GilDash> Just.
<spitfire_01> yah watching mlp too
<_Dark_Moon_> I can't connect to servers on TF2 anymore.. :|
<GilDash> Like literally, by 2 minutes.
<MadSurge> ^
<DerpyMuffins> 2 minutes ago
<Rex_Mundi> So, does this episode prove that flight squads like this are some sort of Military/
<GilDash> Flight squads usually are.
<Gold_Demona> Seems like it
<spitfire_01> <_>
<MadSurge> So GilDash, we sure did have the conversation yesterday eh? :D
<Gold_Demona> I see the Wonderbolts as like the Blue Angels here in the U.S.
<DerpyMuffins> Honestly I think they were looking for an excuse to do a Top Gun reference
<spitfire_01> 6_9
<GilDash> MadSurge: Oh trust me, I've had longer conversations about much weirder stuff too. XD
<Gold_Demona> They're a small elite branch of the Air Force who also do awesome air shows
<BrightPage> What if... The woderbolts acadamey is actually a military academy?
<MadSurge> Why, was there a Top Gun reference?
<Jmo> Rofl.
*MadSurge never saw that movie
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Jaaaaymo~
<BrightPage> I never saw Top Gun
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Cuz Top Gun references is funny? :P
<Jmo> Allo Fluffeh
<DerpyMuffins> The entire episode was a Top Gun reference
<GilDash> Not sure if it's an academy for the military or just the Wonderbolts, but in a way that influences cadets to join the military.
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek, this Spitfire is sooooo se-... makes me happy!<3
*AssaultWithEmbraces nuzzles jaymo and gives him cookies
*Jmo huggles AssaultWithEmbraces
<thelonepony> adorable
*GilDash has never watched Top Gun, so meh.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: no, were there Top Gun references? I didn't see that movie
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya thelonepony :)
<thelonepony> Ohai MLP_Brovakiin :)
<_Dark_Moon_> I heard of topgun. never seen it
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces! <3
<BrightPage> I prefer the A-Team refrence in the Babs Seed episode
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge! <3
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No direct ones that I can recall. Other than the whole episode being kind of like it. =/
<Gold_Demona> Top Gun's a good movie. I highly recommend it
<GilDash> Not sure I can stand that much Tom Cruise. XD
<Gold_Demona> And afterward, I recommend its parody. Hot Shots :D
<CTHULHU> god those eyes
<Gold_Demona> I don't really get the hate for Tom Cruise aside from how he is outside of the movies. As an actor he's not that bad. =/
<_Dark_Moon_> Ughh.. i hate having to get upp :\
<MadSurge> Isn't Top Gun just "jointheArmyjointheArmyjointheArmy" for a movie's length?
<Rex_Mundi> In any case, Spitfire had a different voice this eppisode, I liked the older one better.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Join the Air Force, but yeah.
<GilDash> I think most people preferred Spitfire's original VA from season 1.
<Gold_Demona> Air Force ≠ Army
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: shows how much I care for modern war assets :D
<DerpyMuffins> I prefer Sweedish Spitfire
<YokusaHHart> Afternoon everyone!
<Rex_Mundi> brb joinging the Roman legions
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Morning YokusaHHart
<MadSurge> Applepiiiieeeee
<GilDash> They should get Swedish Spitfire to to English Spitfire.
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<Vordox> Phase4: Mind help me out here?
<YokusaHHart> I like Wrek's new desktop pony :)
<thelonepony> Morning YokusaHHart :P
<Rex_Mundi> Geez I love Spitfire
<MadSurge> Why does swedish Spitfire get hate anyway?
<Gold_Demona> English Spitfire with a Swedish accent? That'd be funny. :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya YokusaHHart :)
<Rex_Mundi> Polish Spitfire ftw
<GilDash> MadSurge: Who hates Swedish Spitfire?!
<Rex_Mundi> Nopony hates Swedish Spitfire
<Kandarihu> Man, that last song reminded me of that really wierd PMV
<GilDash> Rex_Mundi: Exactly.
<RainbowDashh> ?

<Love445> Wrek is a Glorious Faggot

<_Dark_Moon_> Love445: http://nextlol.com/images/2173-my-detector-is-off-the-charts.jpg
<Love445> agreed
<BronyDarth> Installing Paint.net.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Love445, watch your mouth.
<Rex_Mundi> Has the fandom decided on the ship nickname for Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash? I find those cute names amusing.
<Love445> you mean my fingers?
<BronyDarth> Lighting Dash, Rainbow Dust.
<Fluttershys-lam> Dark moon ur faggot detectors invalid
<BronyDarth> No more words Rex_Mundi
<BrightPage> I bet you, I BET YOU that there is already R34 if LD and RD
<_Dark_Moon_> How is it unvalid?
<_Dark_Moon_> It wins
<Rex_Mundi> no discussion of R34
<Kandarihu> Alright. As much as I love this Infected Mushroom, I gotta go for a few hours. Stay cool, please.
<Fluttershys-lam> ur faggot detector is ran by a clone spiderman
<thelonepony> Bye Kandarihu
<GilDash> BrightPage: This is the internet. The episode was even leaked, so I bet it was out before the episode aired.
<thelonepony> :)
<Rex_Mundi> Infected Mushroom?
<BrightPage> We'll try
<Wrek> 05*sigh*
<Fluttershys-lam> i am the real spiderman.
*_Dark_Moon_ gasps
<GilDash> Kandarihu: See ya! :)
<BrightPage> True GilDash
<BronyDarth> Wrek gives up.

<GilDash> What's up? Can't you see the idiots in chat?
<MadSurge> http://i.imgur.com/JrcMb.png forget RD and LD, this is the new OTP
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye Kandarihu :)
<BrightPage> Maybe geting a drink?
<BrightPage> Or a sandwich?
<_Dark_Moon_> MadSurge: lol
<Rex_Mundi> *pats wrek on the back*
<GilDash> Wrek's just swiging Mjolnir around, obviously.
<Rex_Mundi> I know that feel
<_Dark_Moon_> That drawing is amazing
<MLP_Brovakiin> GilDash: :D
<Rex_Mundi> Yeah, its lovely isnt it?
<_Dark_Moon_> Why can't i draw like that D:
<MadSurge> _Dark_Moon_: wait until it's finished! :3
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That is best pairing ever. XD
<Rommulus> Dat feel Dark I know it well
<GilDash> Cloud Chaser and Roid Rage? XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Ikr :D these are the only pairings I approve of
<Wrek> 05some people huh?
<Rex_Mundi> Roid rage X cloud chaser?... Naaaaahhhh
<GilDash> I much preferred Rarity and Thunderlane.
<_Dark_Moon_> I can't stop laughing at these spiderman 60's memes
<Rex_Mundi> GilDash: RareThunder
<MadSurge> GilDash: boo :P
<Rat9Gamer> They're from /b/, hows the make you feel?
<Rat9Gamer> that*
<Wrek> 05hm?
<Rommulus> Just gotta ignore them and keep moving forward Wrek, tis the best thing to do in my opinion
<ekips> good evening all
<Rommulus> Hi ekips
<Rat9Gamer> o hai
<GilDash> MadSurge: Pffft, bet you approve of FlutterMax as well. :p
<TwilightSonata> Hey guys! ^_^
<TwilightSonata> xx
<GilDash> TwilightSonata: Holla! :)
<Rex_Mundi> Rommulus: Do you ever feel bad for killing Remus?
<Rommulus> Hi TwilightSonata
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya TwilightSonata :)
<MadSurge> GilDash: max? O.o
<Jmo> Huh, another Aussie.
<_Dark_Moon_> yey :[
<Chrysalis> so many kickbans
<Jmo> Doesn't surprise me.
<Chrysalis> wreks on a roll
<TwilightSonata> Kickbans?
<TwilightSonata> Huh?
<GilDash> MadSurge: Sorry, FlutterMac. XD
<Rommulus> Rex_Mundi: He had it coming, you should of seen the things the historians didnt find out about.
<Gold_Demona> What's with the string of kickbans today? O_o
<MadSurge> GilDash: Big Mac gets all the ladies
<Chrysalis> rule breakers, they never learn
<GilDash> Trolls enter. Kickbans ensue. Not really a hard concept.
<GilDash> MadSurge: Pffft, Braeburn any day.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Stupid router
<Gold_Demona> I must not be paying enough attention to the chat...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: some genius is calling Wreky a homo :(
<_Dark_Moon_> Go home and be a family man..
<AssaultWithEmbraces> What's happening again?
<Rex_Mundi> I hope we see Lightning Dust again. wait... what about Gilda X Lightning Dust? LightningGilda?
<YokusaHHart> *pulls out walking stick* back in my day, trolling actually required more effort than just randomly insulting people with synonyms with "gay".
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Missed that entirely. The dummy. >=/
<pinkiepoop> I gotta say that Wrek has some interesting taste in music
<GilDash> Rex_Mundi: Pffft, my name's half done anyway. It's be GilDust, obviously.
<Gold_Demona> Rex_Mundi: Gildust?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: people still using "gay" as an insult :|
<Gold_Demona> lol yeah
<GilDash> < I mean, come on. The template is right here. XD
<Rex_Mundi> GilDashDust?
<MadSurge> GilDash: :D
<GilDash> GilDashDust... that'd be interesting to see...
<Rex_Mundi> "gay" is so outdated as an insult. I prefere the original olde Tyme usage of it.
<Chrysalis> Rex_Mundi as in everypony is gay when ponies come on
<Chrysalis> tradtional meanings
<Rex_Mundi> having a gay old time
<Chrysalis> make for awquard sentances
<Gold_Demona> Rex_Mundi: as in Gay = Happy
<Wrek> 05what i find funny is
<Chrysalis> then again, there is the song based on the differences
<Wrek> 05takign time organizing people
<Wrek> 05changing proxy
<Wrek> 05over and over
<Wrek> 05and all i gotta do is rightklick/klik
<Wrek> 05and voila
<Gold_Demona> lol
<GilDash> I know, and it was such a pathetic attack. XD
<Chrysalis> GilDash "attack" isnt the right word
<Chrysalis> not really an attack
<_Dark_Moon_> Why do they even bother showing up :P
<Chrysalis> more like a light tickling
<Chrysalis> cause its far more amusing than anything
<Gold_Demona> A poke maybe?
<spitfire_01> wa happend
<Gold_Demona> dat black screen
<Wrek> 05a silyl filyl that got pissed at me yesterday
<Wrek> 05for kick/banning him when not abidign rules
<Wrek> 05so
<Wrek> 05hes been trying to botehr me since yesterday
<spitfire_01> yah im back
<Gold_Demona> That's sad
<GilDash> It was an 'attempt' at an attack. It was just so shit you can barely recognise it for one.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: John Carpenter's Wonderbolt Academy / Buzz the Tower / Yes Drill Sergeant! / Special Delivery / The Dizzzy World of...
<thelonepony> _Dark_Moon_: thats why i ask all the time... where you here on thursday by any chance? :P
<Chrysalis> if you break the rules when wreks around
<Chrysalis> your gonna have a bad time
<Jmo> You're*
<Gummy_G_Green> What's up everyone
<_Dark_Moon_> Pizza when you french fry..
<_Dark_Moon_> u gonna have a bad time.
<Alchemist> just saw the new ep
<thelonepony> _Dark_Moon_: i'll take that as a no
<Chrysalis> _Dark_Moon_ wth?
<thelonepony> :P
<Chrysalis> isnt the new ep still under spoilers?
<_Dark_Moon_> Oh sorry thelone, no i was'nt.
<Chrysalis> ah, out by like a minute
<GilDash> No, spoilers lifted half an hour ago.
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: nope! LET'S TALK!
<Alchemist> Chrysalis: it is till 24 hours after air time, which just have passed I think
<Gold_Demona> Yay!
<Chrysalis> yeah it would of just finished airingh
<GilDash> We were *just* within the threshold when we started talking about Spitfire's new VA. XD
<Chrysalis> was never clear on that, is it 24 hours after it starts, or 24 hours after it ends
<Rex_Mundi> I watched the new episode 3 times yesterday
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I think 24 hours after it starts
<Chrysalis> see i would assume 24 after it ends
<Chrysalis> in either case, the time has elapsed
<Alchemist> imo the new ep had a huge ptential, but didnt quite use it. It was a decent ep none the less.
<Chrysalis> so we can all go, "finally the RD ep is over so we can watch more important ponies"
<Chrysalis> actually, i need to ignore tom
<GilDash> Oi, I like Dashie.
<Chrysalis> There we go, maybe this time i wont get the ep name spoilt
<_Dark_Moon_> Sudden urge to play RE6..
<Chrysalis> this music, makes me want to jig
<MadSurge> Alchemist: still might be the weakest episode of the season for me... goood episode nonetheless
<Chrysalis> and i can't jig
<Alchemist> MadSurge: it surely didnt have much impact.
<GilDash> It was better then the season opener.
<GilDash> Though to be fair, Spitfire, so I'm biased.
<Chrysalis> yeah, spitfire was awesome
<Alchemist> GilDash: well, the season opener had some lore building, and maybe a bit foreshadowing.
<GilDash> Alchemist: Yes, but that was all of 5-10 minutes of about 40.
<Chrysalis> yeah the opener did feel more like setup than selfcontained
<GilDash> And so far we've seen nothing else interact with it yet.
<Wrek> 05i liek this song
<GilDash> If there's an arc, it'snot arcing very well.
*Chrysalis jigs
<MadSurge> What is this building up to? AAAAARRRGH
<GilDash> WTH is wrong with my space bar?
<Wrek> 05srsly
<Wrek> 05this song
<Wrek> 05:D
<GilDash> I imagine this song might make more sense if I knew Swedish?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<spitfire_01> who wants o go o he rainbow factroy
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Everlasting_Joy :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Good, I didn't miss the drawing :).
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy MLP_Brovakiin!
<thelonepony> Hi Everlasting_Joy :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy thelonepony!
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: Holla! :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy GilDash!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hai Everlasting_Joy
<Everlasting_Joy> GilDash: I know I saw you on the other day, but it's been a while.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy AssaultWithEmbraces!
<kidzrul732> BOO! haha did i scare you
<RainbowAsh> Hiya
<spitfire_01> no
*Nittany_Discord slaps kidzrul732
<GilDash> Okay, he comes in, says it's been too long, then buggers off. XD
<Everlasting_Joy> Site crashed, I'm back.
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: Tsk, running away? XD
<Everlasting_Joy> GilDash: >_><_<...
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: Aye, too long. I've been busy but hopefully I'll be more available now. :)
<Everlasting_Joy> GilDash: :), I know that feeling.
<kidzrul732> i like poptarts
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: You seen the latest episode?
<Everlasting_Joy> GilDash: Yep.
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: Thoughts?
<Chrysalis> dis band :D
<kidzrul732> I like to put chocolate on my pizza!
<Chrysalis> kidzrul732 is it a cookie dough base?
<Chrysalis> with red icing for saure
<Chrysalis> sauce*
<Chrysalis> and white chocolate cheese
<GilDash> Chrysalis: That sounds awesome.
<Everlasting_Joy> GilDash: It was solid. It's not my favorite, of both S3 or over all, but I enjoyed it. I do have to give big props to the ending, that was awesome to watch.
<kidzrul732> Chrysalis, I guess you could say that
<GilDash> I want one.
<Chrysalis> GilDash ikr
<Chrysalis> you could chop up gummi worms for pepporoni
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: I know, right? I don't think it was my favourite S3 either, despite Dashie being my favourite pony, but that Spitfire...
<Wrek> 05"wherever in this world i turn, i stand here with empty arms, waiting for somebody to save me"
<GilDash> Chrysalis: We need to get on this for 2013.
<Wrek> 05basicalyl this sogn in a nutshell
<Everlasting_Joy> GilDash: What of Spitfire?
<Chrysalis> GilDash we should talk to Saturn
<Chrysalis> Wrek sounds so sad :(
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: She's... awesome?
<GilDash> Chrysalis: If we can get hold of him. XD
<Chrysalis> GilDash good look there
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, I am ok with Spitfire, I think her drill seargent self is another side of her personality we just hadn't seen before.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<MadSurge> ^^
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Exactly. We might want to wait until later. XD
<Chrysalis> RainbowAsh or just put on for the recruits
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: I think that's the point. She's a hardass on the recruits but a nice pony when she's off-duty.
<Everlasting_Joy> There's a difference between military life and civilian life.
<Gold_Demona> The way I see it, she was just doing her job with the drill sergeant bit.
<Wrek> 05it is a sad sogn Chrysalis :o
<GilDash> I bet she thinks of how hard she is on them sometimes. I can see her sitting down with a glass of Applejack Daniels and feeling sorry for herself. XD
*Chrysalis passes flaggons of mead around
<Gold_Demona> I don't think so.
<Chrysalis> mead is gooooood
<Gold_Demona> I don't see Spitfire as that squishy of a person
<Rex_Mundi> just realized something, did we see Spitfires Cutiemark?
<Everlasting_Joy> We should have.
<Chrysalis> probably at the end
<GilDash> Rex_Mundi: Yep, and it was awesome. ^_^
<Gold_Demona> She may think about whether she was too hard on her recruits or not, but in the end her job is to weed out those who can't make it.
<Chrysalis> letme just get teh ep up
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: Everyone has a bad day.
<Gold_Demona> And yes, we did see her cutie mark
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, I am so starting up VLC to look it up right now
<Gold_Demona> GilDash: Yeah, but I don't think she'd go feeling sorry for herself over it.
<Everlasting_Joy> Heck, it's better to weed out the chaft and take the wheat.
<Chrysalis> [13:52:00] <Snow> evolves into a mothaf*cking strong thing
<Chrysalis> DAMNIT
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, A flaming wing. Spitfire's cutie mark is a flaming wing.
<Chrysalis> http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/hCL89G.jpg
<Everlasting_Joy> If the recruits aren't up for the challenge, they are than presented the ability to go home, before they hurt themselves.
<Snow> wut
<Chrysalis> looks like a flame?
<Snow> why the ping Chrysalis?
<spitfire_01> https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=231730606960417&set=a.202672753199536.52391.202672286532916&type=1
<Jmo> Cause he derped.
<Chrysalis> Snow accidentle copy paste
<the_real_pony_1604> there is a point early on when she is talking to rainbow dash or just got done talking to her, I can't remember. but she is hovering and flapping her wings. so you can get full view of her mark
<RainbowAsh> Chrysalis, or maybe an owl on fire. I definitely see a wing shape there, but there is a bit at the bottom
<GilDash> They need to do her with her hair down.
<GilDash> Like proper off duty, out of uniform.
<SpeccyRush> does Wrek need the CM?
<spitfire_01> spitfire_01
<Chrysalis> spitefire in this shot http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/Nanqcs.jpg
<crazypony> http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/6/69/Spitfire_yelling_at_a_stallion_S3E7.png i found a pic of spitfire's cutie mark
<Snow> http://browse.deviantart.com/#/d5o77e9
<Wrek> 05SpeccyRush: the one i have is so blurry so sure, pm me it :)
<Gold_Demona> dat browse url
<Jmo> Derp.
<Chrysalis> Wrek http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/hgBpoe.jpg
<RainbowAsh> Maybe she has a phoenix cutie mark?
<Chrysalis> theres a really clear shot
<GilDash> It does kind of look like a phoenix, actually.
<SpeccyRush> and then I blow all previous pics out of the air with this http://derpiboo.ru/183403
<spitfire_01> brb
<Chrysalis> SpeccyRush thats someone re-drawing it though
<Chrysalis> not from the eop
<Chrysalis> ep*
<Chrysalis> kinda cheating
<SpeccyRush> looks just like the one from yours
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, in that it's a flaming bird, yes. But phoenixes in MLP have a longer body, I think.
<Wrek> 05a bird eh?
<Wrek> 05thought it was a branch with "fire" leaves"
<NightFury> Hiyall
<Jmo> It is SpeccyRush.
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: Like I said, kind of like a phoenix. It looks like it's wearing a crown as well. XD
<GilDash> NightFury: Holla! :)
<Chrysalis> actually i do see the bird now its been mentioned
<Gold_Demona> SpeccyRush has the correct one, I think
<RainbowAsh> What if it is a breath of fire? You know, like spit fire
<NightFury> Oooh livestreamed drawing C:
<Snow> it looks like a flaming wing for me
<AssertiveFluttershy1> hey everypony
<AssertiveFluttershy1> whats going on
<NightFury> Haii
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi AssertiveFluttershy1
<Chrysalis> this song
<Chrysalis> is rather upbeat
<cowvarkian> indeed
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: Can we get her some flaming sambucas and try it out? :D
<alexxm|colt> how are things AssertiveFluttershy1
<AssertiveFluttershy1> not bad
<thelonepony> Hi AssertiveFluttershy1
<AssertiveFluttershy1> bin awhile since I was on here
<Chrysalis> Hai
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, maybe that is how she got it
<thelonepony> Snow: Looks more like a Phoenix to me
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Catchy song by the way :)
<cowvarkian> ikr
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: Can we try and find out?
<Chrysalis> Spitfire cutie mark story?
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, go right ahead. Don't expect me to stand in front of her, though.
<Chrysalis> CMC get on it!
<Spitfire> wha?
<AssertiveFluttershy1> hmmmmm
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: Who said anything about standing in front of her? I'll be enjoying the view from behind. ;)
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<AssertiveFluttershy1> interesting idea
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Spitfire cutie mark story...............
<E_J|Homework> Chrysalis: She always wanted to be a Wonderbolt, and had a firey personality to back it up.
<AssertiveFluttershy1> :)
<Chrysalis> ohai DWR
<GilDash> Soarin' should've been there as well. It'd be nice to see the most well-known Wonderbolts cutie marks.
<DashWithRainbows> Hey Chrysalis.
<Chrysalis> I think i prefer cartmans version of this song
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Chrysalis: I don't give a crap about whales so you can hug a tree
<E_J|Homework> Chrysalis: Her mark represents her passion behind her desire to defend Equestria and her hot-headed attitude as an officer.
<RainbowAsh> E_J|Homework, she doesn't appear to be exceptionally hot-headed, though.
<Wrek> 05dont ask me how i found these covers
<Snow> i find littlekuribohs version of this song funnier xD
<Snow> do like this one though
<E_J|Homework> RainbowAsh: Just a thought, but yeah, I can see that angle.
<GilDash> Wrek: Any chance you went to Google and typed in "pokerface cover"?
<Chrysalis> Wrek how did you find these covers?
<AssertiveFluttershy1> You know this is getting ridiculus.......... I excpected alot of fan art of lightning dust maybe even rainbow dash....... Instead I look up the episode and I'm greeted with a torrent of sexual spitfire images!!! :P
<GilDash> I don't think Spitfire's hot-headed, really. That's more a facade for the recruits. I can see her being very passionate about her job and duties though.
<Chrysalis> ^
<Chrysalis> oh wow.... this cover
<Snow> well, i gtg bronystate. fries are ready
<Chrysalis> also, Wrek you made me spend money :( I bought Van Canto last night
<E_J|Homework> Take care Snow!
<Snow> thanks for the stream Wrek
<Chrysalis> 'night snow
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye Snow. Enjoy your fries
<Snow> later
<GilDash> Can we have Dope's "You Spin Me Right Round" after this? XD
<Gold_Demona> I think most of the peoblem here is people mistaking her on-duty attitude with her off-duty attitude.
<Rommulus> Bye Snow
<thelonepony> Bye Snow :)
<GilDash> Snow: See ya! :)
<Gold_Demona> Being a drill sergeant, she has to be all business.
<RainbowAsh> If we roll with a phoenix cutie mark, I am thinking, rebirth by fire. She went through a hellish situation and got her mark when she grew to survive.
<Jmo> o_O
<Gold_Demona> But it's not a phoenix. >.>
<JRP2234> wait
<spitfire_01> ck
<spitfire_01> im back
<JRP2234> IMWORKING ON CHRISTMAS
<JRP2234> WTF
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: Let us plant our epelliptic trees, damnit!
<Gold_Demona> Oooook, whatevs
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, it doesn't look like Philomena, but maybe they are different kind of phoenixes, like with ponies or dragons.
<Vordox> Wrek: You ever played Vanilla WOW?
<Gold_Demona> RainbowAsh: It doesn't look like a phoenix at all. It just looks like fire that's kinda shaped like a wing.
<Gold_Demona> And only kinda
<Rommulus> To me it looked more like a fiery wing or fiery flower, just my opinion
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: Well, I thought it looked like a phoenix when I first saw it, so there. :p
<DerpyMuffins> Hey, how did Spitfire get that tie on?
<Vordox> Did you play Vanilla WoW Wrek? =3
<GilDash> Though I also thought it looked like an autumn leaf at one point. XD
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, the lowest part could be the body of a bird. But yeah, at the beginning I thought flaming wing, too.
<Wrek> 05started late vanilla
<GilDash> DerpyMuffins: You know what, I don't know and I don't care, but it suits her.
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, that wouldn't fit her persona at all, though.
<Vordox> Wrek: I wonder, do you remember a certain Overpowered Orc NPC?
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: I know, that's why I dismissed it. XD
<Gold_Demona> But if you look at the closeup of it, it just looks like fire...
<GilDash> Eye of the beholder...
<Chrysalis> umbarelllllla
<Gold_Demona> http://derpiboo.ru/183403
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, it would be an interesting angle to have some ponies with unifitting cutie marks. "So my special talent was diaper changing. But I said fuck that and went to the foreign legion."
<Gold_Demona> Seriously, look at this
<Chrysalis> you know, this is a good cover
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Wrek> 05no
<Wrek> 05i dont
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: Well, just because you have one thing you're good at doesn't mean you can't do other things as well. Generally though, cutie marks are supposed to represent what you're good at AND what you like doing, so you'd likely make a job of it if you could.
<Gold_Demona> Hence "special talent" and not just "talent"
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, on the other hand, Rarity's cutie mark is tied to her gem finding spell, not to her dress making.
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: Again, depends on the pony. She uses her talent to help find gems for her dresses though, so it's still used to an extent for her job.
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, I see your angle. What then, if some event makes a pony turn away from their special talent, because bad memories are tied to it?
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: "Cutie Mark Failure Insanity Syndrome."
<Vordox> FUUUUCK
<Vordox> YOOOOOOOU
<Vordox> GOOOOGGGGLEEEEE
<linkkirby> lol
<Vordox> They deleated a 7 year old video
<Vordox> THAT I LVOED
<Vordox> loved*
<Vordox> Even from BEFORE YOUTUBE existed
<Yahooz> you mean youtube?
<Gold_Demona> You know... SPitfire's cutie mark could just be based on the contrail she leaves when she flies.
<Vordox> damnit video.google.com
<Yahooz> or not
<Chrysalis> you know after working on so many shows
<Chrysalis> this song actually appeals to me
<Gold_Demona> Like how Rainbow dash's is rainbow
<Chrysalis> its goood
<thelonepony> Vordox: what was the name of the video?
<Vordox> High Overlord Saurfang gets MC'd
<RainbowAsh> Vordox, download what you like. You never know how the net will be tomorrow.
<Vordox> A human female rogue hijinx in Ogrimmar
<Jmo> Ogrimmar.
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, I can see why they would be an unhappy pony... but insane?
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: Maybe... what was Lightning Dust's cutie mark? She left a lightning contrail...
<Gold_Demona> It's lightning with some stars
<DerpyMuffins> RainbowAsh look at Screwloose's cutie mark
<DerpyMuffins> Her talent is being insane
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: AJ can't harvest apples in time, goes insomniac. Rarity can't make dresses, mental breakdown. Dashie can't perform her moves, nervous wrek. Fluttershy can't make friends with the animals, batshit crazy. Need I go on?
<RainbowAsh> DerpyMuffins, is that the pony in the discord episode or the one in the Dairing Do one?
<DerpyMuffins> Daring DO
<DerpyMuffins> It was Screwballs in the Discord one
<Gold_Demona> The one in the Discord episode is called Screwball
<Gold_Demona> I just realized we're listening to Tenacious D. O_o
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, those are acute reactions when they can't make their talents work. But what if a pony decided to never try their talent again?
<Vordox> Videoklippet är inte längre tillgängligt eftersom det YouTube-konto som är associerat med videoklippet har avslutats.
<Vordox> YOOOOOUUUUTUUUUUUUBEEEEEE
<RainbowAsh> DerpyMuffins, maybe she used to be a contractor and had a terrible accident.
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: If you never did anything you liked again, what state would you be in? Severe depression at the very least.
<DerpyMuffins> Then how do you explain Screwballs's cutie mark RainbowAsh
<Vordox> It's been totally deleted from the internet...
<Vordox> Wow...
<Vordox> After 6-7 years. ;_;
<RustyMeat> hai bronystate
<Vordox> One of my favourite nostalgia videos. :'(
<GilDash> RustyMeat: Holla! :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi RustyMeat
<GilDash> Vordox: What vid you bitching about
<CrystalPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsCHIKTRYRk
<GilDash> ?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya RustyMeat :)
<thelonepony> Vordox: that means you have to go to every site to lool for that video :P
<thelonepony> Hi RustyMeat :)
<CrystalPhoenix> WHERE'S THE CHEETOS
<thelonepony> look*
<Chrysalis> CrystalPhoenix no vid links during stream
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: That's a stream
<CrystalPhoenix> there's a stream>
<CrystalPhoenix> ?
<thelonepony> refresh
<Gold_Demona> Yes
<Vordox> GilDash: A very famous WoW video from the Old days of WoW
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, not necessarily. People who loved sports get old and frail, too, and learn to live without doing what they used to enjoy, too.
<CrystalPhoenix> ustream mixed me up
<CrystalPhoenix> well sorry for that
<Vordox> GilDash: One of the best edited videos ever made from a hijinx(Before everyone started to do videos)
<RainbowAsh> DerpyMuffins, the crazy pony's cutie mark from Read it and Weep is just a screw. The discord one got a screw and a ball, but she might as well be a creation of discord himself.
<E_J|Homework> Vordox: I'm sure it's out there if you search hard enough.
<Vordox> E_J|Homework: You're talking to someone that goes through EVERY WHERE
<Vordox> Including other languaged websites
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: That's different if you grow out of it. You've got the time to see yourself getting worse and can mentally compensate and prepare yourself. If you stopped, immediately, for a reason that emotinally affects you so deeply, it would have bad reprecussions on your psyche.
<Vordox> When I say it's dead and gone.. it is =P
<DerpyMuffins> What if your special talkent was prostitution?
<DerpyMuffins> talent
<Chrysalis> you know, i want to coin a new phrase
<Chrysalis> Theres a fic for that
<RainbowAsh> Chrysalis, I am liking that idea.
<Chrysalis> because no matter how messed up the conversations here get
<GilDash> DerpyMuffins: Well, we don't even know if it's illegal in Equestria.
<Chrysalis> theres always a fic about it
<spitfire_01> this ar is amazing
<RainbowAsh> Chrysalis, bonus points if you are read well enough to also provide a title.
<Chrysalis> Can't remember i'm afraid
<Chrysalis> i remember it involved celestia
<DerpyMuffins> Oh, I got it
<SpeccyRush> so Wrek ... gonna include some Äppelpaj maybe?
<Chrysalis> someone needs to do a training montage for AJ/RD with this song
<Drew> Spitfire is awesome
<E_J|Homework> This sounds like a Stan Bush song.
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, true. Not necessarily severe depression, though.
<Drew> wow, the eyes look amazing
<Chrysalis> Drew this is wrek, thats a given :P
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: I'd be surprised if they were completely healthy after it. We could be seeing PTSD and worse.
<Chrysalis> stream dead?
*Kipkat07_Scarf HALO jumps into the chat
<RaveBrony> Died for me
<Kipkat07_Scarf> hiya
<RaveBrony> D:
<Drew> back up
<Chrysalis> refreshing helped
<thelonepony> D:
<RainbowAsh> Btw, what do you think happens to Lightning Dust now? Is she going to be thrown out, or just a stern talking? My head canon is that she and RD just switch places as leader and wingpony.
*thelonepony tackles Kipkat07_Scarf >:I
<Chrysalis> she got kicked out
<Chrysalis> ripped uniform and everything
<spitfire_01> :)
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, yeah. Giving up your talent could well be a symptom of PTSD, if the traumatic situation involved it.
<DerpyMuffins> Well, turns out I don't have it
<DerpyMuffins> But it's about a pony with a cartoon dildo as a cutie mark
<RaveBrony> Woah, wut
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: Or it could be the trigger for it. I can't say I have a good understanding of psychology, but I know everyone's different and we all break down differently.
<Chrysalis> Thats a little more detail than is allowed in this chat...
<RainbowAsh> Chrysalis, but wouldn't that be a bit much? After all she did not even get a single warning.
<Drew> lol, this song
<Chrysalis> RainbowAsh so? she messed up BAD, and ponies nearly suffered really bad for it
<Chrysalis> and she showed no remourse
<Rommulus> 5 ponies could of died from the last mistake.
<FlutterMEDIC> hey guys. i see Wrek is painting
<Rommulus> sad realism but true
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, if you decide not to do your talent anymore out of your free will, that can't very well be traumatic. If you are forced to, on the other hand, that would be a possibility.
<TrixieMuffin> implying fluttershy wouldt have rememberd shes a pegasus all thre way down
<Chrysalis> Theres a fic for that
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> heya FlutterMEDIC
<Rommulus> 4 of them then.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Remix/Vocal Music: The Changeling (Ozzwald's VIP) / Trixie's Return / Through the Night
<RainbowAsh> Chrysalis, she was encouraged by Spitfire all the while, though. Also, I think they would give her a second chance on account what she could do with all her power without proper guidance.
<thelonepony> Hi FlutterMEDIC :)
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: Well, it can. You might have something of a "I'm shit at this, why am I doing it?" and decide to give it up. That's hurt you pretty deeply.
<DerpyMuffins> Lol new R34, there is a fic for that, no exception
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya FlutterMEDIC :)
<Chrysalis> you can't do anything with power if there is no will to control it
<E_J|Homework> I love this song <3.
<Rommulus> I dont think the option for wonderbolt is open any more for her however its not like she has been kicked out of all aspects of flying.
<E_J|Homework> Thank you Sakojima5555.
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, I don't think you would get PTSD from that, though. It might already be a symptom of a depression, though.
<TrixieMuffin> You are now imagining this song killing the aliens in mars attacks instead of the aweful yodeling!
<Chrysalis> you are now imagining pink elephants
<RaveBrony> Lmao
<DerpyMuffins> There is a fic for that
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, I think she would have problems fitting in with a lesser flight team. After all she has the skills and the drive to be on top.
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: on parade, too!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You are now breathing.
<Chrysalis> AssaultWithEmbraces DAMN YOU
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: I'm not saying you'd get a specific kind of disorder, just that you wouldn't be mentally healthy after such an event.
<Chrysalis> i hate that one
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Chrysalis: :D
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: http://i.imgur.com/GolOX.png "Be?":D
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, what if your cutie mark was terrible? Like a talent of stealing from old ladies? I think you could learn to give something like that up and be contend with it.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: What's the "Be?" for?
<DerpyMuffins> Wow, Andrea has an OC now?
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: I think the show tries to preach that your cutie mark also depends upon your perceptions of it. It could mean one sees it as one thing whilst the actual bearer sees it as something else, and that is what the talent actually is.
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: she says "me?" like she had a cold
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: I agree that she would have problems fitting in with a lesser flight team, however I imagine after what happened she wouldnt be able to join the wonderbolts, putting 5 ponies at risk and 4 possible pony deaths is kinda serious.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: Ohhhh
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: no, but that pony looked a bit like her :D
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone here good at finding pics?
<Chrysalis> <3 this song
<Chrysalis> so many mosh pits were had to this song
<MadSurge> Yay, Prodigy! :$
<Vordox> Pendulum
<Vordox> ?
<Chrysalis> pendulum remix of Voodoo people
*Chrysalis moshs
*Vordox dodges Chrysalis
<MadSurge> The original is pretty good too
<E_J|Homework> Oh my are those eyes pretty!
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, on the other hand, RD helped her with everything she did, and she got out fine. Even if she was the one who notified Spitfire, that shouldn't cleanse her record completely, especially when it comes to offenses you get thrown out for.
*Chrysalis </mosh>
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, we have seen cutie marks with non-obvious interpretations, but I don't think we never saw a pony who had to ponder what their mark's true meaning was.
*DerpyMuffins bobs head
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: I'd assume they would know the moment they had it. It's a moment of awakening for each and every pony.
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: That is true in the regard that RD did get off scot free however RD was against it, saved their lives and did the right thing by telling Spitfire what was going on. She should of got some sort of punishment however did not, whether it be favouritism or just their view on the situation.
<MadSurge> http://i.imgur.com/fE22e.gif WHERE ARE MY COMICS AND/OR MY SECRET SANTA GIFT çD
<MadSurge> :D
<DerpyMuffins> Is that a meme already?
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, exactly. That's why I think that Lightning Dust also wasn't thrown out. It just wouldn't be fair at all.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> oh god, MadSurge's gone Pinkie. Run for the hills!
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: only for me
<Chrysalis> bangkok
*AssaultWithEmbraces comes floating with baloons tied to arround her "Run for your liiiiiiiiiiiives!"
*Haku1013 noms cheeseburger for breakfast
<Jmo> baloons.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> balloons*
<E_J|Homework> All right, I must take off. Take care everypony!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You know what I mean, Jmo.
<Jmo> arround.
<Jmo> :P
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: Exactly, it wasnt fair however I believe she was thrown out due to the torn uniform and not even recieving the badge.
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: join me, there's an amazing world beyond the fourth wall!
<Vordox> CHESS
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye E_J|Homework
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, I think so, too. That's why you could later on come to be discontend with what your mark turns out to be.
<Haku1013> CHECKERS
<Vordox> IT IS FRIGGING CHESS
<Vordox> <3<3<3<3<3<3
<Vordox> One NIght in Bangkok! <z3
<thelonepony> Bye E_J|Homework :)
<Chrysalis> why not select the black and invert?
<Chrysalis> called it
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: Really? Do they have cotton candy?
<Haku1013> yes
<Haku1013> wait
<Vordox> Wrek: <3 THANK YOU FOR PLAYING THIS REMIX
<Haku1013> no
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: yesh :3
<Vordox> <3 I love Chess SOOOOOO muuuuuch!
*AssaultWithEmbraces grabs MadSurge and destroys the fourth wall in search of cotton candy
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: Maybe, but it supposed to be something you love so much you'd never give it up.
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, I am not that familiar with military customs. Is ripping the uniform of a cadet to throw him out really a thing?
<Haku1013> NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
<Haku1013> NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN
<Haku1013> something something something blah blah ROICK ASTLEY
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, unless the cutie mark magic can look into the future, how could be sure?
<GilDash> RainbowAsh: It's magic.
*Chrysalis gets some satisfaction
<Haku1013> What if... a cutie changes?
<Haku1013> What if... a cutie mark changes?
<Chrysalis> Theres a fic for that
<Haku1013> THERES A FIC FOR EVERYTHING
<MadSurge> Oh no, Microsoft Sam is grooving out! :D
<Chrysalis> this song is so badass
<Chrysalis> the music video is awesome
<Haku1013> nyeh
*Haku1013 pushes
*Chrysalis is pushed
<JRP2234> welp the wii u was a flop
<Haku1013> hmm?
*Chrysalis does the dance as learned from Dance Central
<JRP2234> next year next gen consoles come out
<JRP2234> maby
<Haku1013> lame
<JRP2234> but most likely
<Chrysalis> unlikely
<Chrysalis> maybe 3/4 quater
<Chrysalis> but not for summer
<GilDash> < I wouldn't mind seeing that in the office every morning.
<Haku1013> I remember when a single game console lasted for several years before they came out withanew one
<Vordox> Time to order some PIZZA
<JRP2234> fun fact my laptop is still more powerfull than the next gen xbox
<Chrysalis> Haku1013 this current generation has been the longest ever
<Haku1013> Chrysalis shut up
<GilDash> This generation's been going for 5 years.
<Chrysalis> its old, outdated
<GilDash> 2007-2012.
<Chrysalis> we need new hardware
<Haku1013> SHUT UP I WIN
<GilDash> Not ending it in 2013 would be utter stupidity.
<Wrek> 055?
<Chrysalis> also, the games are showing the age of the hardware
<Wrek> 05more liek 8
<GilDash> Really? 8?
<Wrek> 05aye
<Chrysalis> they should of ended it years ago
<GilDash> Fuck...
<Wrek> 05crysis 1 still looks better than the newest one
<Wrek> 05why?
<Wrek> 05consoles
<Haku1013> I think we can all agree I won this argument
<Chrysalis> Wrek its a sad fact
<GilDash> Oh, aye. It pisses me off PC's neglected for consoles these days.
<Chrysalis> They didnt even release crysis2 on dx11
<Chrysalis> until they got ALOT of hatemail for it
<naturesfury> Wrek: crysis 1 was made for pc in mind. crysis 2 was made for consoles in mind
<Haku1013> There should be an online TRansformers game
<Chrysalis> naturesfury actually neither
<Wrek> 05yeah i already stated that naturesfury
<Chrysalis> crysis was made to show off their new engine
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: I believe the torn uniform is being used as symbolism to reffer to LD as being removed from the group, as she was not given a badge and was also not shown in the final shot with all the ponies in the air flying and thus leads to my opinion of LD being thrown out.
*AssaultWithEmbraces dances
<Chrysalis> theyre new engine for 2 was heavily console optimised built for the current generation
<Chrysalis> the old engine was them building for the generations after
<Chrysalis> wub wub wub
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Gaah this song reminds me that I'll probably never get to see deadmau5
<Haku1013> nyeh
<Wrek> 05this is as close techno gets to dubstep withotu eing dupstep
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, yeah, but she got lead away, so she couldn't be in the final shot. Maybe she got chewed out and came back later with new uniform and silver badge.
<Wrek> 05the bass threw that b upside down
<Chrysalis> Wrek you ever listen to hardcore at all?
<Wrek> 05probably not
<Jmo> Lel Ghosts 'n' Stuff
<Chrysalis> fair enough
<Haku1013> I should REALLY watch the new episode
<Chrysalis> bass speaker is happy
*AssaultWithEmbraces glomps Jmo
*Jmo huggles AssaultWithEmbraces
*Haku1013 sneaks into the love ball
<GilDash> <-- With an expression like that, you've got to wonder what she's called you in for.
<texasboykc09> hello everypony
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: Rash and irresponsible decisions in any institute that could lead to deaths, especially 4 - 5 would cause someone to be thrown out of that institute. If someone was to endanger 4 - 5 peoples lives in cadets I am damn sure they wouldnt be there afterward.
<Lyra`> http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/381980_10151566915984966_887727501_n.jpg
<Chrysalis> repeating my earlier point, she didnt care that she did it either
<thelonepony> Hi texasboykc09 :)
<Chrysalis> she showed absolutely no remorse for nearly killing 4 ponies
<Wrek> 05brb grabbin' dinner
<Lyra`> Shit... ive forgotten to feed my neo pet for the last 10 years
<Chrysalis> Lyra` know that feel bro
<Haku1013> Lyra' Dude... its dead
<Barbetos> Neo pet... why does that sound familiar?
<Lyra`> you dont know that!
<Jmo> Pfft, Neopets.
<Jmo> Tamagotchi or gtfo.
<Haku1013> Lyra' Its gone, let it go
<Rommulus> Its alright Lyra` you can get a new one.
<Malavolent> Jmo: Tamagochi was the shit.
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, Spitfire was generally ok with the tornado, though. And LD couldn't possibly know that a balloon would suddenly appear in the training area.
<Haku1013> THEY SHOULD REBOOT NEOPETS
<Goldframe> didn't viacom buy neopets for their nick brand?
<Jmo> Oath it was.
<Barbetos> Haku1013 Hah. I know right. But that is a funny way to say that it should never come around again.
<Haku1013> Theres nothing wrong with reboots
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: However she may not know that the balloon would appear there were still other students thats lives were endangered by the tornado.
<Jmo> Didn't think Wrek listened to music like this.
<Jmo> Surprised.
<Barbetos> The music is too.
<Malavolent> Jmo: Though my tamgochi always died over night.
<Jmo> RIP
<Haku1013> They offer a new way to look at something old, for a newer generation. Sometimes, it's tuhe reboots that are better.
<Lyra`> http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/531767_10151563465364966_1735235070_n.jpg
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, I don't think pegasi would be in that much danger. Even when the 800 wing power tornado in Hurricane Fluttershy came tumbling down no one was hurt.
<Lyra`> and thats the story of why im not allowed in american burger kings
<texasboykc09> Wrek is doing a good job at drawing spitfire
<Haku1013> I still say unicorns are better
<Barbetos> Lyra' Um... I don't think there are any other kind.
<spypengen> earth pony is best pony
*Haku1013 doesnt like bacon either
*Haku1013 and is american
<Jmo> Other kind of what?
<Malavolent> Haku1013: Heresy!
<Barbetos> Other kind of Burger Kings
<Jmo> Australia has Hungry Jacks AKA Burger King.
*Haku1013 could go for some Whataburger
<Jmo> Only a few remain with the old name in NSW, but is mainly called Hungry Jacks.
<DerpyMuffins> There may be a single BK spot in the UK
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I want some Five Guys
<Barbetos> I supposed that counts. They should of named it Austrailian Burger King.
<GilDash> There's plenty of BK sports in the UK. I had one only the other day.
<Haku1013> Do they have The Outback Steackhouse in Australia?
<Jmo> Steack?
<Jmo> How to engrish.
<Haku1013> Steak
<naturesfury> Haku1013: :|
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: Yet it is still irresponsible, all it takes is 2 of the ponies to collide in a tornado that LD and RD couldnt control and they would plummet to the ground.
<Malavolent> Oh Jmo, your such a gnazi.
<Jmo> Yeah they do.
<Haku1013> Do they have The Outback Steakhouse in Australia, or is it just called food over there?
<Jmo> They have 6 of them open, 7th to come.
<Haku1013> Speaking fo which
<Haku1013> Are there AMERICAN resuarants?
<Jmo> Malavolent, you're*
<Lyra`> i lovemost of you
<Jmo> <:
<Haku1013> Like, theres mexican and chinese and indian and other stuff
<Lyra`> and electric work out
<Chrysalis> Haku1013k and what pray tell would they serve?
<Haku1013> American food
<Haku1013> duh
<Chrysalis> americans havnt really invented any foods
<Lyra`> which induces muscle spasms
<mitamakng> hola everypony
<Haku1013> WE INVENTED THE HOT DOG
<Chrysalis> theyre all stolen, made with cheaper materials and sold on
<Chrysalis> except twinkies
<DerpyMuffins> Americans invented a heartattack on a bun
<Chrysalis> and youlet them die
<Haku1013> Twinkies are dead now
<naturesfury> Chrysalis: ahh the good ol' merican way
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, irresponsible and reckless? Yes. But I don't think that is grounds for a permanent exclusion. Those recruits are still young, and LD might well have learned her lesson.
<DerpyMuffins> Twinkies kill
<mitamakng> So Wreks is doing art, and that looks like... Spitfire
<Chrysalis> now how will zombie land come to pass
<Malavolent> Jmo: Come on, their's no need to do that.
<texasboykc09> mitamakng: hello
<Chrysalis> actually....
*Haku1013 likes the cupcakes better than twinkies
<Jmo> Malavolent, oh you.
<Chrysalis> is that how zombie land came to pass
<Jmo> You make me chuckle.
<Chrysalis> its so hard to find a twinkie because theyre are none left
<mitamakng> LD was a hothead who never realized she did anything wrong, she wouldn't have learned a lesson even if she had just been punished
<Malavolent> Jmo: You wouldn't think I don't grammar, right?
<Haku1013> A man once sold a twinkie on Ebay for 300000 dollars
<mitamakng> Anyway it was just a fantasy camp.... I think
<Jmo> You're ever so silly Malavolent.
<spitfire_01> what up
<DerpyMuffins> Lol, I still have a box of Twinkies from 2005
<Haku1013> There's that one company that's thinking about buying twinkies from Hostess
<thelonepony> Haku1013: wut?
<Haku1013> Yeah
<MadSurge> Haku1013: smart man, fool the buyer
<Chrysalis> Haku1013 yeah a mexican company
<Haku1013> TWINKIES ARE NOW MEXICAN FOOD
<DerpyMuffins> Mexican Twinkies?
<MadSurge> :D
<Chrysalis> you americans are that screwed up, mexicans are saving the only thing you had going for you
<Chrysalis> well, and MLP
*Haku1013 is now prouder to be of mexican/hispanic descent
<thelonepony> Haku1013: /)
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: Again, RD seemed to have a bit of favouritism and not even get a slap on the wrist and LD did get a severe punishment but it was within good judgement, LD caused RD to clip her wing which does not show good leadership when flying and showed no remorse for doing so, she showed shhe could not work in a team or be pacient when she and RD knocked all other flyers away and endangered many lives with the tornado. This showed she was able to b

<Malavolent> Eww, text.

<MadSurge> Chrysalis: yeah, because english candy is so horrible right? I mean what
<Jmo> All these Americans.
<DerpyMuffins> MEXICO
<Rommulus> Australian here
<Wrek> 05i didnt try brittish candy
<Malavolent> Wrek: You've been drawing for quite a few hours today, haven't you?
<Wrek> 05but what i can say is that the food sucks
<GilDash> Wrek: Depends on where you go.
<Chrysalis> horrible? seriously brittish sweets are so much better
<Wrek> 0590% of everythign is concentrate with essense of various fruits
<Alchemist> I might get sent out for 6 months next year to Stockholm :)
<Jmo> Huh, forgot you were Australian as well Rommulus.
<DerpyMuffins> I am offended by that Wrek
<sub06905> dat spitfire o.o
<Haku1013> Rommulus is it true that everything is trying to kill you over there?
<Chrysalis> and yes i have had american equivelants
<Wrek> 05but to fix that
<mitamakng> Not sugar.... the horror
<Chrysalis> seriously how you guys ruin chocolate so badly i have no idea
<GilDash> Of course, I prefer Italian cuisine over British food anyway. XD
<Wrek> 05IRN'BRU and a superb asian citchen
<Wrek> 05kitchen*
<Rommulus> Haku1013: >.> <.< Fear the drop bears....
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, i generally prefer indian to english
<Wrek> 05srsly the take out asian food was fantastic
<Wrek> 05specialyl the thai
<Haku1013> I LIKE FOOD
<DerpyMuffins> Asians know how to cook
<MadSurge> GilDash: smart man :3
<Chrysalis> no one in brittain ever actually eats brittish food
<Haku1013> FOOD IS AWESOME
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, the last part of your message was cut off. Still, it was her first offense. If she was made wingpony and managed to stay in line with her leader, she could still become a valuable asset.
<Chrysalis> we just have it for the tourists
<GilDash> MadSurge: I quite like Indian curries as well. ^_^
<spitfire_01> i
<AssaultWithEmbraces> http://gabriev666.deviantart.com/art/Gothic-Metal-Chrysalis-343056997?
<MadSurge> GilDash: I never tried curry :O
<Malavolent> Chrysalis: They don't eat fish and chips errday?
<GilDash> Actaully I don't know why I was trying to defend British food at all. I'm not a big fan myself. XD
<Chrysalis> Malavolent god no
<Malavolent> But the books say they do!
<Chrysalis> You know the most popular food in brittain
<Chrysalis> is an indian curry
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: Thats as if saying attempted murder (long stretch there) should be a slap on the wrist offense.
<GilDash> Chrysalis: That's because it's awesome.
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Haku1013> I always wanted try spicy curry, like from that one naruto episode
<Chrysalis> GilDash i know right
<Saturn> 08,01i'm thinking of being a bastard
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Saturn
<naturesfury> Saturn: go 4 it
<Chrysalis> although apparently the brittish versions are nothing compared to the indian
<Saturn> 08,01my dad has made this loom program in VB
<texasboykc09> hello Saturn
<Malavolent> Chrysalis: How about irish cooking?
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: A Magnificient Bastard?
<Saturn> 08,01and he's designed some hardware to go with it
<thelonepony> Hi Saturn
<Chrysalis> really want to go to india for a big strong curry
<Saturn> 08,01it's taken him months to design it and put it together
<Chrysalis> Saturn in VB?
<Chrysalis> he deserves everything bad that happens
<Chrysalis> thats the devils language
<Malavolent> Saturn: What, you can actually programm something useful in VB?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm considering reversing his hardware and coding up my own software in python
<Saturn> 08,01and then releasing it open source
<Chrysalis> do it in lua
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, the difference between LD's offenses and something like murder, is that the latter is done out of malice. LD was reckless, but she didn't want to hurt anyone.
<Saturn> 08,01(he wants to distribute his as closed source shareware)
<mitamakng> LD did not learn her lesson, that was the problem
<Haku1013> nyeh
<RainbowAsh> Saturn, does he need the money?
<Chrysalis> nothing wrong with shareware
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowAsh: yeah, kinda; but i'm not convinced there's a market for it
<RainbowAsh> mitamakng, she did look quite shocked in the end.
<Saturn> 08,01i'd just be doing it for the fun of reversing it
<Wrek> 05Saturn
<Wrek> 05check stream
<mitamakng> That was over getting kicked out
<Saturn> 08,01so i'll probably not be a bastard
<texasboykc09> Saturn: can we see it
<mitamakng> Not over what happened
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: She may of not wanted to hurt anyone but she also did not show any form of care for hurting after she had done so to RD and almost done so to all the others. I think she was expelled however I believe she would be allowed to return once she has proven that she is no longer as reckless as she once was.
<Saturn> 08,01texasboykc09: unfortunately not; he's not released it for distribution yet
<alexxm> nice picture
<Saturn> 08,01and i don't have it installed currently
<RainbowAsh> Rommulus, expelled, but be allowed to try again next year? Yeah, I could see that.
<mitamakng> I just want LD to be a RD rival
<Rommulus> RainbowAsh: So we agree on this? Hooray long winded debate over XD
<Malavolent> Heya alexxm, how have you been?
<mitamakng> I miss Trixie being a rival, we need a new one
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: oh wow
<alexxm> i'm good Malavolent you
<texasboykc09> Saturn: but why VB? is there any thing out there that better?
<Malavolent> alexxm: Well I'm kinda tired, but it's okay.
<Wrek> 05also
<Wrek> 05love this song
<Rommulus> I wonder if they will bring back Gilda at some point in time.
<Wrek> 05punkadelica
<flutterfan99> i hope not
<RainbowAsh> mitamakng, I don't think Trixie's trixing days are over yet. But yeah, I would love to see LD as RD's rival. I think she would be better as a rival inside the Wonderbolts instead of independent from them.
<flutterfan99> i hate ldd so much
<flutterfan99> ld*
<mitamakng> Here is how I see it, LD will blame RD for losing her shot, the rivalry writes itself after that
<Haku1013> GOTTA GO BYE
<Alchemist> I couldnt help but to think mybe Derpy will appear in the beginning when they were waiting for the mail pony...
<Barbetos> Gary Oak of MLP has been found it seems.
<flutterfan99> they will never bring back derpy
<flutterfan99> to much contravusy
<Alchemist> flutterfan99: it seems so
<RainbowAsh> flutterfan99, give them time.
<mitamakng> Okay the Ustream ads are a bit much
<Rommulus> I agree Alchemist, I was really hoping derpy would be there.
<Wrek> 05i saw these guys live almost a year ago now
<Wrek> 05it was awesome
<Drew> I know this song by heart
<Lyra`> oh wrek
<Drew> Fallout :3
<Lyra`> this music
<flutterfan99> i meen ofcorse i want them to
<Alchemist> chat derped
<Rommulus> <3 This song <3
<flutterfan99> i should play fallout
<DerpyMuffins> Fallout music
<RainbowAsh> mitamakng, if LD remains in the Wonderbolts, she is still set back and no longer a leader. I think that would suffice for rivalry without making her a bitter character.
<Goldframe> the offical theme song to any nuclear wasteland
<mitamakng> Why not bring in the Shadowbolts?
<Rommulus> Agreed RainbowAsh
<DerpyMuffins> I would bet there is a fic of LDxRD
<texasboykc09> Wrek: what software are you using?
<Rommulus> As in the Year set back thing.
<Rex_Mundi> im back, awesome, the ink spots
<Goldframe> looks like Sai
<mitamakng> Imagine if LD finds the jealousy that possesed Luna
<JRP2234> texasboykc09 SAI
<Rommulus> Then thats some bad news bears going on mitamakng
<Alchemist> What exactly is the role of the wonderbolts besides doing some parades?
<Rex_Mundi> Fallout new Vegas > Fallout 3
<RainbowAsh> mitamakng, what would her villain name be then?
<JRP2234> micheal jackson made sonic 3's music
<Alchemist> They seem to be military like.
<mitamakng> Lightning Dash?
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: I imagine the same role the Blue Angels play in the U.S. Air Force.
*Kipkat07_Scarf parachutes into the chat
<Kipkat07_Scarf> hiya
<Rex_Mundi> Rainbow Lightning
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, I think the shows are the main stay, but they also fight dragons apparently.
<Rommulus> Alchemist: I see the Wonderbolts as protectors of Equestria, as they were sent in when Spike had grown due to greed.
<Drew> yeah
<Lyra`> damnit wrek!
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Oh my god... good music..........
<Gold_Demona> Am I the only one who sees the Blue Angels connection?
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: They were based on the Blue Angles, so no...
<mitamakng> The Wonderbolts are the Blue Angels, they are a publicity for the Equestrian Air Force
<Gold_Demona> That's waht I thought
<Gold_Demona> what*
<Alchemist> RainbowAsh: maybe we just see them during shows because... there arent that many wars going on in equestria :D
<mitamakng> Alchemist: fair
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, I think there was even word of god that the Wonderbolts were inspired by the Blue Angels.
<naturesfury> 2 bad they were nowhere to be seen when spike did actually grow or during the dragonshy episode
<Alchemist> I also couldnt help to notice how they avoided RD to say that her friends nearly got killed :D
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, when RD talks about the Wonderbolts, she is always talking about the shows, not about defending, though.
<Rex_Mundi> They also seem to a sports team, they race other teams and such
<Gold_Demona> Cuz the Blue Angels are a legit military force, but they're also known for their air shows.
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, "smashed to pieces" was a rather obvious way to paraphrase that, though.
<Rommulus> I second the notion of the Blue Angels.
<mitamakng> The Blue Angels are the best pilots in the Air Force
<Gold_Demona> In the dragonshy episode, the dragon wasn't out on a rampage. It was just sleeping in the wrong place
<Goldframe> Blue Angels = Navy
<mitamakng> I can see wanting to be part of the best fliers in Equestria
<Lyra`> gah
<Lyra`> wrek
<Lyra`> all this music
<Goldframe> you're thinking of the Thunderbirds which are Air Force
<Lyra`> and its feeeels
<Alchemist> RainbowAsh: and I think "demolished" was the other word she used. Its just funny, those are not the words that would spring to one's mind.
<Gold_Demona> Oh yeah! That's right. Blue Angels are navy!
<Gold_Demona> They're the navy's fighter pilots
<mitamakng> As a Navy brat
<sub06905> didnt the woderbolts fail to stop spike when he went all big and greedy
<sub06905> wonderbolts*
<mitamakng> As a Navy brat I love the Blue Angels, take that Thunderbirds
<Rex_Mundi> Funny thing about the Blue Angles doing air shows, that must be a left over from earlier times where inlisted men can customize their equipment. Lets see an airforce piolet todat paint a big boobed lady on his plane.
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, maybe they got a code what they can't say in the show.
<Lyra`> i do a smashing rendition of blue moon
<WymanDaBrony> Whats on?
<thelonepony> sub06905: eeyup
<Lyra`> it involves blue body paint, a cane, and a tie, just a black tie
<jcelios> oh shi-
<Rex_Mundi> Frank Sinatra is pure good.
<jcelios> that looks really good
<sub06905> >best flyers in equestria
<sub06905> >fails to stop spike
<Tervicz> Wrek: idea: add a big pint of cider to make her look RAF?
<Alchemist> RainbowAsh: they CANT say killed in a kid's show. My poit is that in this episode it was comedically obvious.
<sub06905> :I
<Wrek> 05raf?
<Tervicz> British
<Gold_Demona> Royal Air Force
<Wrek> 05rit
<Wrek> 05e'
<Lyra`> psh, royal army is sooooo much better
<Rex_Mundi> Ponies were almost killed all the time in G1.
<Gold_Demona> dat Franky :>
<jcelios> that apple cart that trixie threw almost crushed a pony@
<Goldframe> rex: That's because they could get away with more in the 80's
<Rex_Mundi> The ponies were almost killed by a Hydra in season 1.
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: and it was two decades ago.
<RainbowAsh> sub06905, dragons are fierce creatures.
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, it just wanted to play.
<thelonepony> sub06905: hey, at least they tried their best to controll him before he made severa damage to the town :I
<Gold_Demona> Actually the 80s were 3 decades ago. :P
<thelonepony> severe*
<sub06905> thelonepony: tried their best :D, all they did was fly around him
<jcelios> is this GIMP?
<RainbowAsh> sub06905, they clipped his spikes, too
<Rex_Mundi> So is Rainbow Dash in the Military now lol
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: I was optimistic :D
<Rommulus> He is using Paint Tool Sai
<Goldframe> Sai is more friendly when it comes to vectoring
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, basically, yes.
<sub06905> it feel diffrent to see spitfrire without her wonderbold suit on
<texasboykc09> sub06905: okr
<sub06905> spitfire*
<texasboykc09> *ikr
<Rex_Mundi> Spitfire makes my heart flutter
<cowvarkian> thats not good
<Rex_Mundi> lol
<sub06905> guess i got to used to seeing her i her wonderbolt suit
<sub06905> in*
<Tervicz> Oddly I was epecting at least one Battle of Britain referrence in the last episode. Sadly none :(
<E_J|Homework> Hi guys!
<texasboykc09> E_J|Homework: hello
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya E_J|Homework :)

<sub06905> oh right the 24 hour rule has passed for the episode

<Rex_Mundi> I guess its time equestria had an epic pony war...

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Uncertainty / Remembrance / Dust to Dust
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: I agree. And with the equestrian army actually holding their own and not just being a backdrop.
<Rex_Mundi> Equestria has an army? all ive seen was the princesses guards
<thelonepony> sub06905: wut?
<JRP2234|Musics> WUBS
<Alchemist> thelonepony: Full Metal Jacket reference
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: I assumed since they have guards, they also have an army.
<sub06905> ^
<Rex_Mundi> To keep the Zebras and Saddle arabians out I assume.
<thelonepony> Alchemist: ah
<thelonepony> i see
<thelonepony> :P
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: that sounds so xenophobic :D
<Wrek> 05seeing the history lesson from all eharts warming eve

<Rommulus> Oh wow it is 4:03am XD I am ment to wake up in 4 hours.
<Iggy> :o
<Rommulus> Night all! Cant wait to see the finished product on DA Wrek
<mitamakng> I think we have all come to an acceptance that ponies are really rascist
<Tervicz> They are the Spartans of Equestria
<Tervicz> no?$
<RainbowAsh> Night Rommulus
<texasboykc09> Rommulus: night
<thelonepony> Night Rommulus :)
<sub06905> nai Rommulus
<sub06905> bai*
<Rex_Mundi> Alchemist, there are already Cows and donkeys in equestria, they need to stop imergration or Equestria will be full of... Lamas and stuff.:'(
<alexxm> bye Rommulus
<mitamakng> Llamas has two Ls I think
<Rommulus> Hugs for RainbowAsh, texasboykc09, thelonepony , sub06905 and alexxm!
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, the ponies migrated to Equestria themselves.
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: all them foreigners are taking the ponies jobs! Lets round them up in ghettos I say!
<thelonepony> RainbowAsh: ah so the Buffalos where there first
<Rex_Mundi> Bah, If the Buffalo really wanted that land they would have planted apple trees themselvs.
<RainbowAsh> thelonepony, probably.
<Alchemist> test
<Alchemist> oka
<Alchemist> y
<mitamakng> Rex_Mundi: I am not that familar with that episode, but didn't the buffalo go first
<ekips> I love your music taste Wrek
<Alchemist> mitamakng: they did
<Rex_Mundi> Huh, this joke has gotten so manifest destinyish and somewhat Nazi-esc.
<thelonepony> http://i.imgur.com/usEWl.gif
<mitamakng> So the evil pony settler came and tried to take their land, probably for beads or something
<texasboykc09> the buffalo was there first. then the settler took that land form them.
<Rex_Mundi> In seriousness though, the land that became Equestria seemed uninhabited to me, the Buffalo lived south of that and only recentkly have the two had problems, otr so it seems.
*Kipkat07_Scarf returns to the chat
<Eulshy> Littlest pet shop is good this week
<texasboykc09> Rex_Mundi: by how that ep. started thee had problems for a while.
<texasboykc09> *they
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, since the ponies had at least Roman age tech back then, the days when there was a thing like unclaimed land were long gone.
<Barbetos> I remember seeing some where that the land of Equestria is actually made to look like Pony Island or something like that.
<Barbetos> It also went on to say that Equestria is a really small part of the overall world.
<RainbowAsh> Barbetos, from the official map, it looks roughly like NA
<Rex_Mundi> RainbowAsh, the ponies had lived someplace before they came to Equestria, maybe up north. But just because they had roman tech doesnt meen anything in a fantasticle fictional History.
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, of course, anything goes in fantastic realms, but unless it is canonized I'm going with common sense. And that tells me that sentient life must have been around for many centuries and in that time all available land will have been claimed.
<Rex_Mundi> I also wonder how many tribes of ponies exsisted, were there other clans besides the 3 that initially made equestria, maybe there were earth pony tribes and such that never joined equestria.
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, you mean like the Chrystal Ponies?
<Rex_Mundi> RainbowAsh: yeah, that proves there are pony realms outside of Equestria.
<Wrek> 05...
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, or at least used to be. After all, the Crystal Empire was in hiatus for a thousand years.
<Tervicz> And maybe the heartwarming's eve story isn't entirely true. That usually goes with these old stories
<Rex_Mundi> Perhaps hostile wild pony tribes would be interesting
<RainbowAsh> Rex_Mundi, definitely. Also, don't forget about the other sentient creatures that are around. I especially hope to see the Griffon empire one day.
<alexxm> dinner back soon
<Lil_B> Man, Wrek is still drawing, must have been 6 streight hours now or more
<Lil_B> more like 7 I think
<DerpyMuffins> Dang, drawing isn't as easy as I thought it would be
<Wrek> 05this sogn is epic
<Chrysalis> ooh serj
<Chrysalis> not heard him in a while
<MadSurge> Lil_B: dude is dedicated to the pony arts
<Merc_Xephos> so much detail
<RainbowAsh> If Wrek had a cutie mark, it would be an eye with all the detail he puts in it.
<Merc_Xephos> in the end that hard work wont be so apperant, since its so small
<MadSurge> But the picture would be poor
<Rex_Mundi> I would like to see dragons in this show that arnt jerks, other than spike.
<MadSurge> *poorly made
<Tervicz> Maybe a female Dragon should be introduced?
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: have an adult dragon explain dragons' society! :D ^and that too
<sub06905> a female dragon? let all the shipfics begin
<ekips> maybe a female dragon that shows interest in spike but spike rejects her
<Merc_Xephos> maybe characters from On a Cross and Arrow?
<Merc_Xephos> or humans?
<MadSurge> Only Megan should be allowed to ever show up
<Rex_Mundi> My guess is that there many species of Dragons, there are ones that migrate, ones that sleep for 1000 years, etc.
<Rex_Mundi> Bacon and Applejack.
<ekips> It's bacon and applejack!
<Tervicz> Either Spike gets Rarity or he gets a female Dragon in the end, no?
<Wrek> 05gona finnish anneli's request tomorrow probably
<MadSurge> Males migrate and stay out all night, females actually do shit and build cities :D
<Rex_Mundi> A female Dragon would allow spike to get shipped with someone other than a pony.
<Wrek> 05then gona start on libmans
<Wrek> 05but for now
<Wrek> 05i need a break from drawing
<Wrek> 05hope ya like watchin!
<Merc_Xephos> well im gonna go

<Barbetos|InstantWOW> Does it really matter what I think? I just decided that it was over hyped for a game that is not that scarey
<sonicandmario85> slenderman is coming to town
<sonicandmario85> XD
<texasboykc09> sonicandmario85: why does yours show less mods
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> The only reason anyone talks about it is becuase it was streamed or put on youtube by "insert famous youtuber here"
<scout19_tf2> sonicandmario85: tip toe toooo the window
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> Xrays
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> Better than Y Rays

<Socks> Twitter is messing up, anyone know what's going on? Google isn't yeilding anything. http://s11.postimage.org/ov9i29x2r/Twitterz_is_derped.png
<_Dark_Moon_> Nobody streaming? ??
<texasboykc09> MadSurge: that is so awesome
<scout19_tf2> i want one
<texasboykc09> _Dark_Moon_: SuperBrony64 is
<Invi> the one who built that thing must have been very bored
<scout19_tf2> :D
<alexxm|colt> Socks try refreshing
<Socks> MadSurge: I knew that pony would take off, I knew it.
<_Dark_Moon_> I can't see anything.. all i see is loading the justin.tv player is not allowed
<Socks> alexxm|colt: I have, several times :(
<Snowden> _Dark_Moon_: open up a tap and copypaste the URL
<Invi> _Dark_Moon_, that's a chrome problem. try firefox
<Snowden> then get a Pop-up of the Chat
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Make sure you're not usingChrome
<_Dark_Moon_> Damn chrome :L
<texasboykc09> _Dark_Moon_: IKR
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> I use chrome all the time
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> Whats wrong with it?
<MadSurge> Socks: she's also OTPed with Big McLargeHuge now :D
<_Dark_Moon_> The justin.tv stream does'nt work with it barbetos
<_Dark_Moon_> Atleast for me
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> Oh.
<Invi> ditto
<Socks> It works, when I'm not signed in and when I'm in incognito mode, because that makes sense
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> Yeah. Same here
<_Dark_Moon_> Im using incognito
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> I just went to the actuall justin acount.
<Invi> you can sign in into chrome?
<_Dark_Moon_> Yeah i can sign into anything on incognito, it just does'nt save any data/history
<Snowden> if ya know what he means
<_Dark_Moon_> Wow my laptop has something stuck in the fan and it's making a clang noise
<Invi> then get it out
<_Dark_Moon_> Can't.
<Snowden> tweezers
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> That would probably make it worse
<_Dark_Moon_> I had it repaired
<_Dark_Moon_> 3 times
<_Dark_Moon_> Noise still there
<Barbetos|InstantWOW> SCREAMER!!
<Snowden> spinning
<Snowden> damn
<scout19_tf2> i remember when we streamed heavy rain:D
<Nyst> what's the game being played?
<Snowden> The Room for the IPad
<Nyst> Thanks.
<texasboykc09> SuperBrony64: what are you playing
<Nyst> How does one stream an ipad game?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02texasboykc09: The Room
*Kipkat07_Scarf has a 50 cm long slim jim
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nyst: Using an Apple TV
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Or an HDMI adaptor
<Nyst> Ah, pretty cool that that's possible.
<Snowden> hes not SUPERbrony for nuthin'
<Nyst> Shame I don't have an ipad though. This looks fun.
<_Dark_Moon_> DayZ not streamed at all yet?
<Snowden> _Dark_Moon_: the walking simulator?
<_Dark_Moon_> Snowden: good one.. not if your a bandit
<thelonepony> Snowden: more like a Survial
<thelonepony> survival*
<_Dark_Moon_> Get your hands on a team of freinds and a weapon and you'll be killing people ;)
<Snowden> Ive played DayZ. its walk for, like, goddamn 45 minutes, and either get shot or hackers
<SpeccyRush> SuperBrony64: if this is The Room where's Tommy Wiseau
*Kipkat07_Scarf noms a slim jim
<_Dark_Moon_> The aim of the game is survival. you don't go out and run around aimlessy.. head for a town or something
<Shizuka> 13NO
<Shizuka> 13Kipkat07_Scarf: YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG
<Shizuka> 13YOU MUST SNAP INTO IT
<Shizuka> 13OOOOH YEAAAAAAAH
<Ponies47> o.o
<GilDash> What?
<_Dark_Moon_> Shizuka: errr..
<Ponies47> test
*Kipkat07_Scarf laughed and shot slim jim out his nose
<Kipkat07_Scarf> owie
<Kipkat07_Scarf> :<
<Ponies47> o.o
<Shizuka> 13close enough
<Socks> I will ask again, Twitter looks like this http://s11.postimage.org/ov9i29x2r/Twitterz_is_derped.png google yields nothing, anyone in here have any tech knowledge or know what this is?
<_Dark_Moon_> Rustlin' my jimmies
*Suzano dies in agony
*Kipkat07_Scarf snaps into a slim jim
<Shizuka> 13Socks: CSS isn't loading
<Snowden> _Dark_Moon_: tried, but they are either the small ones with like 5 actuall houses or ransacked cities crawling with badnits
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: Try restarting your browser, that happens to me too
<Shizuka> 13and could that image be any smaller?
<Snowden> it took us a week just to FIND eachother
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guys... my dad said he loved me o.O
<Nyst> locked chests with keys inside that open locked chests with keys inside: the game.
<Socks> I have tried restarting my browser many times, and how to I get the CSS to load?
<_Dark_Moon_> Snowden: Yeah it really sucks cause bandits and hackers OWN that game. I would usually lay low and get some weapons and gear before heading out
<Snowden> _Dark_Moon_: my friends recomended War z
<Dark92Enigma> Socks: it happened to me, refresh
<_Dark_Moon_> Snowden: Im getting the DayZ standalone
<Snowden> coolio
<_Dark_Moon_> Ughhh.. 2 tests in the morning
<Socks> Dark92Enigma: What do you think I've been doing for the past few weeks, it's been like this for ages and won't fix :(
<_Dark_Moon_> Good thing is school ends at 12:30am this whole week
<GilDash> Socks: Reinstall your browser?
<Dark92Enigma> Socks: OH. :O
<DerpyMuffins> That box is like puzzel-ception
<Socks> GilDash: Will probably try that if nothing else works
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: What is the browser? i lost the picture link :)
<Socks> http://s11.postimage.org/ov9i29x2r/Twitterz_is_derped.png
<Socks> Soz for small size but I think you get the idea :P
<GilDash> Socks: That picture really is rediculously small. XD
<MadSurge> Why can't devices this awesome exist in real life? :D
<Socks> I'll see if I can grab a better one
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: Emm.. try reinstalling chrome i suppose. if not i'll try find another solution
<GilDash> MadSurge: Why can't you just smash 'em with a hammer? XD
<thelonepony> Socks: how old is your computer?
<MadSurge> GilDash: that's a Gordian Knot approach! :D
<Snowden> MadSurge: Normal humans dont have the patience to make or solve such a thing
<Socks> thelonepony: Not sure, only got it recently but it is second hand
<_Dark_Moon_> It's a Windows XP so im guessing it's old
<Socks> Samsung Netbook NP-NC10
*Kipkat07_Scarf fininshed snapping into the 50 cm long slim jim and now needs some wayer
<Socks> Is what the words tell me
<Kipkat07_Scarf> *water
<_Dark_Moon_> The release of your PC was in 2009
<GilDash> MadSurge: No, it's the "Get things done" approach. Or the Jeremy Clarkson approach. XD
<_Dark_Moon_> God im gonna fail Gaeilge.. not lucking forward to 2morrow morning
<GilDash> Socks: It's probably a browser issue. Reinstall your browser.
<Socks> Ok, reinstalling browser it is... Smoke me a Kipper, I'll be back for breakfast
<GilDash> I've not heard that phrase in a while...
<Nyst> Nice
<Nyst> Ace Rimmer
<Socks> All my love for red dwarf :P
<_Dark_Moon_> SuperBrony64: I don't get this box.
<MadSurge> GilDash: the story is that Alexander the Great approached an impossible knot, and the one who would undo it would rule the known world one day
<GilDash> MadSurge: Oh I see, so he just slashed though it with a sword.
<MadSurge> GilDash: Alexander's approach? Take his sword and slash it! Exactly
<GilDash> MadSurge: See?! That was a man who could get things done! :D
<MadSurge> GilDash: and then died of a fever :D
<GilDash> MadSurge: Yeah, but using a hammer/sword/whatever didn't do that to him. XD
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Holla! :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02_Dark_Moon_: It's a puzzle
<Nyst> Man this game is tickling all kinds of fancies here. I wish it were on pc.
<GilDash> It's a crazy puzzle.
<_Dark_Moon_> SuperBrony64: what's the game called?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The Room
<killerpony7733> GilDash Ohai also i was on before this but BSOD so i had to reboot. So that is why you saw me join XD
*Snowden throws smoke ball and escapes out of window
<_Dark_Moon_> My PC always gets BSODs.. it's really annoying
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Bloody BSoD, eh? I had my new laptop at work do that recently... the very first time I booted it up. XD
<linkkirby> gu gisw u=a veyone
<linkkirby> *hi how is everyone
<killerpony7733> GilDash Meh was playing swtor suddenly bam BSOD
<_Dark_Moon_> Lol link
<Buytoast> this one of them amnesia mods?
<linkkirby> what game is this?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The Room
<Buytoast> that aint no room
<Buytoast> thats a clock
<linkkirby> k
<GilDash> killerpony7733: That's what you get for playing SWtOR. :p
<_Dark_Moon_> Buytoast: It's a room with a clock in it.
<linkkirby> what do you do in it?
<GilDash> <--- What would it take to build one of these?
<Nyst> Looks like the top screws off?
<_Dark_Moon_> Is the objective to like.. open the clock or something?
<Nyst> And it did! cool
<killerpony7733> GilDash Nope my laptop decides to crash or BSOD when it wants. Be it while doing simple things or playing games. So no that's not what i get for playing swtor
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You solve puzzles
<linkkirby> k
<Invi> GilDash, i guess mostly Nerves
<Nyst> Man with a game like this I don't even care about the objective. Solving the puzzles is it's own fun.
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I was just joking. XD But that sucks. Does it happen regularly, like every couple of hours or something?
*Kipkat07_Scarf noms a cookie and gives one to SuperBrony64
<GilDash> Invi: I don't think I could build a puzzle piece out of nerves. :D
<Invi> o u :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hey SuperBrony64 wanna cookie?
<killerpony7733> GilDash Nah it doesn't comes about maybe once a week or so? not bad really. But yeah it does unexpected stuff at times.
*Kipkat07_Scarf noms a cookie and gives another to SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D
*SuperBrony64 noms on the cookie :3c
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: i liek cookies :3c
*aniderp|bestcakeever gives cookie to SuperBrony64
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i know you like them :P
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I had an old PC that used to BSoD every couple of hours or so. Never figured out what was wrong with it, but at least I could time when it would fuck up. XD
<_Dark_Moon_> My old PC used to shut off by itself
<Socks> Urgh! Having to use IE to download chrome does not get more pleasant with time.
<DerpyMuffins> It's 3/7 SuperBrony64
<Suzano> uuuuugh!!!!! sooocks
<Nyst> There has to be a clue as to the correct date to set the time to.
<Socks> And it didn't work :(
<killerpony7733> GilDash Oh well
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: Your using IE? nightmare
<Nyst> Speaking of which, hiding a secret in a clock by usiing the hands seems rather impractical, since once a day you'd have your secret compartment fly open on it's own.
<Socks> Chrome is reinstalled and my twitters still no working :(
<linkkirby> anyone here got lego LOTR?
<GilDash> Socks: There might be a problem with your drivers or something. Alternatively, it could just be Twitter.
*Socks weaps into his pillow
<Invi> Nyst, but it only works with the glowy stone he put into the clcok
<Invi> *clock
<Socks> Thanks for the help guys, guess I am doomed to forever be without twitter, ah well, not a great loss :P
<_Dark_Moon_> did this only start happening recently?
<linkkirby> i hardly ever use my tiwtter
<Nyst> I was speaking in general secret clocks, but good point. Glowing gems solve everything.
<Socks> _Dark_Moon_: No been happening for a while :(
*aniderp|bestcakeever sobs cause her tummy hurts
<thelonepony> Socks: give a day or two
*Socks rubs aniderp|bestcakeever's tummy
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: Woah that's strange.. maybe Gildash is right.. problem with drivers? :P
<Nyst> 6:05 is probably it
*Socks pretends he knows what that means
<Shizuka> 13drivers do not cause browser rendering issues
<no> cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer
<Socks> How do I fix the drivers
<Shizuka> 13he's not receiving CSS
<DerpyMuffins> Fianlly
<Shizuka> 13drivers have nothing to do with it at all
<DerpyMuffins> Finally
<_Dark_Moon_> Oh right.
<GilDash> Shizuka: What does that actually mean?
<_Dark_Moon_> So df is wrong with CSS?
<Nyst> Wait what...how did all those things fit inside the box if it was hollow?
<Shizuka> 13i don't know
<Socks> Cascading Style Sheets
<_Dark_Moon_> I don't even know what that means lmfao
<GilDash> Shizuka: Fair enough. XD
<Shizuka> 13all he's posted is a miniscule screenshot
<Invi> Nyst, satanic ritual

<RaveBrony> Yeah :P
<Invi> RaveBrony, http://w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp
<GilDash> That man knows no bounds.
<Socks> w3schools is super special awesome
<_Dark_Moon_> Invi: WTF Did you just lead me too? i saw a bunch of words and green
<GilDash> Invi: Thanks for the link. I might have to browse that. :)
*Socks learnt all he knows about HTML from w3schools
<RaveBrony> Invi: oooOOoo, thanks :o

<Socks> It's like you're learning from Tim Burners Lee himself :P
<RaveBrony> :(
<Chrysalis> who needs a job :)
<Nittany_Discord> Don't end up a failure.
<Invi> I got that link from a pal ^^
*_Dark_Moon_ should be studying but is on bronystate instead :P
<Socks> ^
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: But the world is ending in a few days, whats it matter? Hurr Hurr Hurr!!
<Dark92Enigma> By the way......by ''stick it to ___'' one means ''stick'' as in ''stay together'' or ''hit''?
<Nittany_Discord> We wish.
<sonicdude558> Hi gurrrrrls
<GilDash> Invi: Well, thank your pal for me as well. :)
<RaveBrony> Sooo many of my friends in Florida are relying on the world ending :D
<Socks> :D
<GilDash> When is "the world ending" anyway? Is it the 21st?
<RaveBrony> "Screw tests, world is ending"

<_Dark_Moon_> I just think they don't want to finish the calender lol.. "Nah im bored"
<Socks> A year ago if you don't :P

<Chrysalis> well thats a fine how do you do

<otakon> oh
<Sumica> 00,10I kept snipeing medics
<otakon> I swore I saw "Bolt Action Rifle" not just Bolt Rifle

<otakon> ah
<otakon> damn if only my PC could run it
<otakon> DAMMIT
<Sumica> 00,10a bolt action bolt driver
<_Dark_Moon_> I can't wait to get my new gaming PC
<Sumica> 00,10not sure why a what is basicly a railgun needs a bolt
<DerpyMuffins> Is her nose the only thing holding the shades up?
<Sumica> 00,10just like on the ep DerpyMuffins
<Ponies47> Heh. I downloaded PS2 but haven't even touched it yet really
<GilDash> DerpyMuffins: You can get glasses like that in real life as well.
<DerpyMuffins> Pony physics
<GilDash> Sumica: I thought she folded her glasses when RD came in to see her?
<Sumica> 00,10she did
<Sumica> 00,10she has ear bits on them
<Sumica> 00,10but if you look at it they sit below the ears
<GilDash> Sumica: ... That's a bad design. XD
<Sumica> 00,10twas how they did it on the show
<DerpyMuffins> What rank is Spitfire exactly?
<alexxm|colt> DerpyMuffins general?
<Sumica> 00,10no point of reffrence to tell
<GilDash> No, I just meant from a general design point. Why have handles if they don't rest against anything? It's just added mass.
<DerpyMuffins> She looks like a commander
<Suzano> whos drawing this ;o
<otakon> DerpyMuffins: we don't know how rankings work in Equestria but she's obviously top dog of the Wonder Bolts
<DerpyMuffins> Wrek

<GilDash> Yeah, Wrek has that affect.
<Sumica> 00,10it's rather amazing how far he has come in a year
<otakon> Suzano: Wrek has been doing this stuff for over a year now here, and he's IMPROVED since I got here if you can believe it
<Ponies47> I can't draw for squat XD
<otakon> ^
<otakon> at least on PC, I suck with a mouse
<Suzano> im drawing since 6....
<GilDash> It's quite inspiring really. Even I've got the urge to try drawing at some point.
<Suzano> and im not even close
<Ponies47> But yet over 30 people stalk me on DA <.<
<otakon> Ponies47: they're coming for you....
<_Dark_Moon_> I use a tablet to draq
<_Dark_Moon_> draw*
<Vordox> Chess <3
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I can draw. I just need a compass, ruler, and pencil
<otakon> _Dark_Moon_: Wrek USED to use a mouse all the time until he got his tablet
<DerpyMuffins> How is the drawing going Ponies47
<Kipkat07_Scarf> but theyre only just comics
<Ponies47> I have SAI but I need a tablet. ;A;

<Socks> I don't play footbal

<Socks> It's football everywhere, you all say it wrong
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: ikr
*Kipkat07_Scarf gets Ponies47 an ipad
<_Dark_Moon_> I call it football
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Futbol is best ball
<Socks> WHo invented the game? I think you'll find we did therefore you call it what we call it :[
<_Dark_Moon_> Broke my thumb goalkeeping once.. damn was it painful!
<Socks> _Dark_Moon_: Ouch
<Ponies47> I never play sports. :p
<_Dark_Moon_> Im a amazing goalkeeper when im onform though
*Socks broke his leg playing football once, and has never done any kind of sport since
<DerpyMuffins> Wrek still has that wing to do
<GilDash> Socks: If you look back far enough, it was probably invented by the Chinese or even before that. England just made the modern game popular.
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: Not wearing shinguards? :)
<Socks> GilDash: Shush you ¬_¬
<DerpyMuffins> Try Tennis
<Socks> _Dark_Moon_: Nope I was around 7 :D
<DerpyMuffins> You really don't run that much
<Ponies47> I suck at all sports! :D
<Socks> Tennis can be fun, It's the only sport I'll play with my dad
<DerpyMuffins> I got tennis going for me
<thelonepony> Pelotas para jugar con tus manos? Me gusta~
<_Dark_Moon_> I wear gk leggings, kit shirt, Rival Pred gloves, and Predator X boots.
<GilDash> I prefer squash to tennis.
<GilDash> Though I'm better at tennis than squash. XD
<Socks> My history teacher is a huge football fan so he and my other classmates spend half out lessons shouting at each other about whose team is best :D
<Socks> *our
<GilDash> Socks: That's sounds like a typical history lesson. So much crap that you waste most of it. XD
<_Dark_Moon_> here are my gloves:
<_Dark_Moon_> http://csimg.pricesavvy.co.uk/srv/GB/0000269017730/T/340x340/C/FFFFFF/url/fingersave-ultimate-ii.jpg
<DerpyMuffins> I saved 5k on college by playing tennis
<_Dark_Moon_> 120 euros double padding fingersave ultimate ii
<Socks> I have had epic history teachers, my GCSE History teacher got bored of teaching us one day so we all put the tables on their sides and played castles :D
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: Lucky.. my school is super strict.
<DerpyMuffins> I think my history teacher beat me once
<thelonepony> Socks: Are you in Highschool?
<Socks> They're still allowed to do that!
<GilDash> Socks: That sounds like a pretty crap teacher, actually. A fun guy, a crap teacher. XD
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Socks> thelonepony: I'm in Sixth form now, that teacher was in GCSE
<_Dark_Moon_> ^^^
<Wrek> 05wait!
<thelonepony> Socks: ah, i see
<_Dark_Moon_> Sixth form?
<Wrek> 05i know a prefect song for this
<otakon1> oh yeah
<Socks> GilDash: He was acctually an excellent teacher, I learnt more from him than any other teacher in my school. That was just one day when he could not give a shit. And he wasn't as bad as my headmaster whom I consistantly had shouting matches with.
*Kipkat07_Scarf is pissed.
<Socks> My school was many things, strict was not one of them
<_Dark_Moon_> What's wrong Kipkat07_Scarf
<DerpyMuffins> Lucky you, I had a nun for one of my teachers
<otakon1> _Dark_Moon_: his phone got stolen I think
<_Dark_Moon_> If my phone got stolen i'd hunt them down and take people in for questioning :L
<Ponies47> I went to private school from kindergarden to 8th grade. Worst fucking years of my life -_-
<Vordox> Wrek: Danger Zone Top Gun OST? :P
<Socks> My teachers were the best thing about my school though, I went through three years of near silence because no one would talk to me :(
<_Dark_Moon_> I just love my GK gloves.. can't be without them :)
<Kipkat07_Scarf> My aunt comes over and then she says she has to cut my sideburns. I however want to grow them out and she says they look unruly and I dissagree. She then says that I look quote "gay" with my sideburns like that.
<Ponies47> Socks: I know dat feel :s
<Kipkat07_Scarf> she then cuts them fucking short
<thelonepony> Socks: same here
<Socks> I managed to get one friend, but she was friends with the people who wouldn't talk to me so... yeah... sad times :(
<DerpyMuffins> Top Gun music for Top Gun episode

<_Dark_Moon_> Ugh i feel like the odd one out :|
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I dont want to look like a jock asshole. I just want look how i wanted to look
<Socks> _Dark_Moon_: Y?

<Ponies47> I've only had one real friend in my life and then he betrayed me -_-
<_Dark_Moon_> I know everyone and are freinds with everyone in my area :\
<GilDash> Still trying to figure out what she's thinking...
<Kipkat07_Scarf> i had one friend through Kindergarten to 3rd grade and then I moved across the fuckin country where I had one friend there too
<_Dark_Moon_> I play alot of sports and i get to go to alot of places around IRL/UK
<DerpyMuffins> Talk about fast http://ponybot.net/?i=6383
<Socks> I managed to make it through my early life with around 5 friends, I have lost them all pretty much :(
<Wrek> 05back
<_Dark_Moon_> You guys will prob see me on TV on Sky Sports playing football soon :3
<_Dark_Moon_> Cuz im playing in front of Liverpool and stuff over in England in Spring
<thelonepony> Socks: but i was able to make friends earlier, i moved when i was in 4th grade, came back in the middle of 7th
<Socks> _Dark_Moon_: Be sure to let us know when you're on, What team you in?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> DerpyMuffins: JJ cheated because he saw the episode on youtube earlier this week :P
*Ponies47 hugs Socks "I have no friends right now. Like I've said. I've only had one true friend and then he betrayed me"
<_Dark_Moon_> Im playing in front of Liverpool, Wigan, Stokes, United and Everton
<_Dark_Moon_> So i hope i sorta make the big breakthrough
*Socks hugs Ponies47 back
<thelonepony> Ponies47: the one that came up with that name for you?
*Socks does not know what playing in front of means
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Scoot-Scootaloo: my aunt is a bitch :<
*alexxm|colt kidnaps Socks
<otakon1> X-MEN!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Sucks man :/
<alexxm|colt> woo best them music ever
<thelonepony> Kipkat07_Scarf: tell her "dont like how i look like? go suck a chood"
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: It's like.. trialing. you play in front of them in football and if you do good, they'll contact you and ask for your signature
<Ponies47> thelonepony: My OC's name? No I'm talking about IRL people.
<thelonepony> Ponies47: ah
<_Dark_Moon_> I'll be earning 15,000 a friggin week to prob sit on my ass and watch a match!!
<Socks> _Dark_Moon_: Oh ok, Well good luck, I hope you get in :)
<Socks> _Dark_Moon_: You lucky sod
<_Dark_Moon_> Say im injured and i can't play
<_Dark_Moon_> Sit back and relax and get payed
<Socks> I have been very lucky with friends as it is, but I've lost enough to appreciate it when I have them.
<DerpyMuffins> Ahh NItty isn't here
<Kipkat07_Scarf> thelonepony: she works at a prison and her husband is an ex-cop asshole
<_Dark_Moon_> I know TOO many people.. i can't keep up with them
<Kipkat07_Scarf> thelonepony: i enjoy being alive thank you
<thelonepony> Kipkat07_Scarf: wait, wut?
<DerpyMuffins> I had the perfect Spitfire pic for him
<Ponies47> Being alone with no friends IRL sucks ._.
<thelonepony> Kipkat07_Scarf: ah, well sorry :<
<_Dark_Moon_> My phone has over 450 contacts -_-
<_Dark_Moon_> too many teeeexts.. my phone is being raped D:

<RaveBrony> you teach me and ill teach you!
<jojoyasmin> Must resist...singing... I'll look weird...er
<Socks> It's sort of the reason I connect with fluttershy, she's not good with people and any friends she has have fallen into her lap out of sheer luck, if she loses them then she aint getting any more :(
<thelonepony> Ponies47: remember what most of us told you, Join a Club, do some sports if you want, Get in the tech group whatever you do. You will find people to talk to
<_Dark_Moon_> I can relate to Rainbow Dash cause im pretty sporty :D
<Kipkat07_Scarf> my headphones only play sound in one ear :'(
<thelonepony> Hell, Join the Acting club to Show them your acting~
<thelonepony> Kipkat07_Scarf: that sucks, what brand?
<Ponies47> thelonepony: Yeah. I looked into that. All the clubs they have I was not interested in. I suck at sports so that's outta the question. :I
<Socks> Ponies47: Go to places, find clubs, I found a filming club, the majority of people I would call friends now, I found at that club
<_Dark_Moon_> I gotta give a shoutout to bronystate on Sky Sports lmao :3
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: MY BRAND
<Vordox> Phase4: Dat awake Australien
<thelonepony> Ponies47: what do you like to do?
*twilight_sprinkle slaps thelonepony around a bit with a large cow
<Ponies47> thelonepony: Sit at my computer all day and that's it really.
<_Dark_Moon_> Guys play football and even if you don't know the people you'll make freinds with them over time!
*thelonepony slaps twilight_sprinkle around a bit with a Large chancla
<Rex_Mundi> is this Powerglove?
<Socks> _Dark_Moon_: Give a shoutout to me! :P
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: I will :)

<_Dark_Moon_> Wrek: Dangit, make me feel like i suck at drawing D:
<texasboykc09> _Dark_Moon_: ikr
<Ponies47> He'll do that to you ;_;
<Socks> I didn't diss lightning dust :'(
<jojoyasmin> Everytime someone draws something amazing, your art looks like stick figures compared to their work...
<_Dark_Moon_> jojoyasmin: haha ikr
<kidzrul732> My brother was trying to sneak at his christmas presents
<GilDash> Vordox: She has to learn somehow.
<Vordox> GilDash: Eeeyup
<Zacklego> I also assume he is using a tablet
<_Dark_Moon_> I see a really old HP monitor under the stairs and im thinking
<_Dark_Moon_> "is that for my alienware?"
<thelonepony> Vordox: I never dissed her, But arrogance caused her being kick out. I only wish she gets redemtion for what she done
<jojoyasmin> GAH I know this song, but I can't name it!
<Vordox> thelonepony: She didn't get kicked out
<_Dark_Moon_> Vordox: she got demoted
<Vordox> demoted, yes
<thelonepony> Vordox: really? damn memory is shitty for me today -_-

<_Dark_Moon_> freaking epic song.. gets me pumped before matches :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9ekXmri0lk
<jojoyasmin> It is batman!
<GilDash> Vordox: It wasn't really clear, but it looked as though she was kicked out to me. Hell, she had guards escorting her.
<Vordox> D'aaaaw http://thesassyjessy.deviantart.com/art/Academy-Cuddles-343182681 Snowflake :D
<_Dark_Moon_> GilDash: I doubt she was sacked on the spot.. i'd say demoted
<Vordox> GilDash: We'll never see
<jojoyasmin> the_real_pony_1604: Once you said batman, I figured it out XD thanks
<GilDash> _Dark_Moon_: Considering what she did, possibly.
<_Dark_Moon_> I missed the livestream so i watched a MASSIVE full screen 1080p youtube episode.. it was win
<thelonepony> Vordox: wait, her name is Snowflake. I never knew :O

<twilight_sprinkle> why
<Yahooz> because who the hell learns anything at that stage of life anyway?
<Snowden> What is this the Credits for?
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: wasn't a plate, it's a lid from a paint can
<Snowden> or the intro?
<otakon> outro

<jcelios> I know I didn't learn anything intil at least 12
<otakon> OH GOD

<Snowden> yes
<Goldframe> yes it is
<Snowden> Its a bunny girl
<DerpyMuffins> Why am I reminded of playboy everytime I see this
<otakon> tha happens to be busty as hell for a high shcooler
<otakon> DerpyMuffins: playboy bunny outfit
<otakon> um is it me or does the animation look rougher than usual?
<Snowden> otakon: not in this show genre
<Zeus> it felt as if millions of perverts cried out in joy and then silenced
<Dark_Horst> is it jsut me or does this sound like incredibly cheap studio equipment?
<otakon> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> dat....singing...
<otakon> I think that's what they were going for
<Shizuka> 13it is
<Goldframe> that's the idea with episode 0

<Goldframe> what about time travel?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> ...Why is she wearing a Bunny Costume in the middle of the night?
<Snowden> she is from the future, of course, a combat waitress bunnygirl- from the future

<Zeus> yes
<Goldframe> twilight_sprinkle: have you never seen haruhi?
<twilight_sprinkle> Goldframe: ive only seen some eps on stream

<Lyra`> @zeus, the band CPDs song Saddest thing i know?
<Shizuka> 13we made it to the giant fish before people said WHAT IS THIS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND GO BACK TO PONIES
<Barbetos> My copy of this anime has this nice... buzzing sound... when it plays
<Goldframe> or even the fuko portion of Clannad
<Snowden> Goldframe: god damn air...
<Barbetos> Makes it hard to listen too.
<Lyra`> or kathleen turners rendition of nocturne on 9 no 2 on the violin
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, so what gen did you hit them with?

<Barbetos> awwwesomme. Well I was gona fix my server stuff, but Shizu put anime on.
<Barbetos> DROP EVERYTHING!!
*Snowden drops the bass
<Zeus> love this opening
<Goldframe> Zeus: Is it because of the jiggle effect that Mikuru gives?
<Zeus> Goldframe: no dude becuase ima sucker for eye rolling Japanes numbers
<Shizuka> 13yuki is cheating
<Ryunosuke> creepy girl is still creepy
<Pinkies4thWall> I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
<Goldframe> god i love this scene
<Zeus> ...is everyone a pervert
<Zeus> in this show
<Kandarihu> Well, Yuki has that ability, so it's not really that much cheating
<Ryunosuke> what is japan without maid cafes? :)
<Zeus> a country with rich history
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
*Pinkies4thWall hugs twilight_sprinkle
<Ryunosuke> and suddenly perverts everywhere
*twilight_sprinkle hugs Pinkies4thWall back :3
<Ryunosuke> ohai twilight_sprinkle
<Kandarihu> http://danbooru.donmai.us/post/show/77242/
<twilight_sprinkle> ive been here all day, but hi Ryunosuke :P
<Zeus> lol
<Ryunosuke> :p
<twilight_sprinkle> lol Kandarihu
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Ryunosuke. HUG PILE
<Kencolt> I just read what had to be the single silliest WoW related thing ever. I was on the forums, and someone couldn't find a certain set of dailies-- not impossible. And one person asked "DO you have to fly there? Because I don't have a flying mount."
<Ryunosuke> hey Pinkies4thWall :)
<Kandarihu> ...less than a second after I posted that link, I just remembered something.
<Snowden> what?
<thelonepony> Hi Ryunosuke :)
<Pinkies4thWall> I am now om the way to being a regular at two sites
<Zeus> Kencolt: is that the whole story?
<Ryunosuke> hey thelonepony
<Shizuka> 13throw a ring and throw away your life
<Shizuka> 13i'd fund it
<Kencolt> Well, even if the player was level 90-- and she was-- I could see that as possible. Then I see she's a druid. Any WoW player here will see the ingerent problem with that.
<Shizuka> 13oh right
<Shizuka> 13this is the haruhi singing ep isn't it
<Goldframe> yup
<Snowden> band4life
<Zeus> yes
<the_real_pony_1604> yes it is, and it is a good one
<Shizuka> 13MEHHHHHH CHOIR WAS ALWAYS BETTER
<Kandarihu> I promised not to post any links for an undermined time after that incident with prince-dari's requests. I figured it should be a month to match Wrek's streaming ban.
<Ryunosuke> i havent played wow for years, do they still get the flying transformation spell thing?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: and i say it was an accident and you should forget about it
<Shizuka> 13woo mosh pit of five
<Pinkies4thWall> I'm already a regular here. Next stop on my list is Celestia Radio
<Kencolt> Zeus: A freaking DRUID. Yes, they do, Ryunosuke . WHy does a druid complain about not having a flying mount?!?
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: incident?
<Ryunosuke> thought so
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Shizuka> 13suddenly haruhi
<Suzano> lol
<Zeus> ima newb bout da wow
<Goldframe> all hail Zone
<DerpyMuffins> Dat face
<Ryunosuke> inb4 song
<Suzano> i saw amvs about it
<Snowden> dat fear and confusion
<Derpy_Hooves> i laughed a bit too much at that guitarist's playing
<Barbetos> Incoming epic time
<Zeus> prepare for the ham and cheese everypony
<Suzano> are there gonna blow stuff up?
<Shizuka> 13the time to turn you your volume is now
<BlazeAngel> Turn it wich way?
<BlazeAngel> QUICK
<Snowden> TURN IT UP EVERYPONY
<Goldframe> up
<Suzano> LEFT
<Pinkies4thWall> Wait. Shizu. Volume up or down?
<Shizuka> 13UM
<Shizuka> 13SIDEWAYS
<RoboGerbil> dat engrish, shizu's watchiung too much dubs
<BlazeAngel> GOOD ENOUGH
<otakon> oH YEAH THIS BIT
<Mutterguy> I LIKE LOUD NOISES!!
<Shizuka> 13my brain's been mush all week .-.
<otakon> Shizuka: a'www
*Goldframe has seen this sung live
<Goldframe> <_<
<Suzano> :x
<twilight_sprinkle> theyre totally i faking, thats not even her voice lull
<Goldframe> it is
<the_real_pony_1604> I have, at a con. it wasn't as good
<twilight_sprinkle> *faking it
*BlazeAngel morphs into what is now known as Shizu
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, accidents are no excuse. I'm not that very much trusted. It's VERY easy to think I posted that link on purpose and claimed it to be an accident. And unless I can PROVE that it was an accident, I'm as good as guilty of doing it on purpose.
<Snowden> this, sket dance, and flcl is the only music ill listen to from anime so far
<Pinkies4thWall> I can't hear this at all over CR. :P
<BlazeAngel> Oi SuperBrony64, you dere?
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: what did you do?
<otakon> BlazeAngel: you are not Shizu
<BlazeAngel> otakon: Hm?
<RoboGerbil> Kandarihu: yay for being guilty until proven innocent
<Goldframe> the_real_pony_1604: let me guess, Anime Expo 2007 in Long Beach?
*thelonepony noms on BlazeAngel's + hat :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well you dont have to prove it to me, i know it was an accident. and it wasnt even a big deal, weirder things have been streamed
<otakon> crap
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wow i still remember God knows
<otakon> is anyone else getting random buffer?
<twilight_sprinkle> no
<thelonepony> naw
<the_real_pony_1604> Goldframe, na local small con.
<Snowden> otakon: eeenope
<otakon> seriously i just watched a whole damn movie from YT and this is giving me buffer
<Ace> nope
<otakon> WHY ?
<Zeus> only in Japan will you have lyrics like this
<BlazeAngel> Needs more Yuki
<Goldframe> Lost my music is better
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, when prince-dari took requests while waiting for S03E06 to load, I posted a Youtube link in #Vinyl_Scratch that had pornographic content in it's "previous video" button at the very end.
<RoboGerbil> needs more pony
<Zeus> ^
<Dark_Horst> ah
<Barbetos> So cute.
*Barbetos asplodes
<Shizuka> 13catch yo breath haruhi
<Dark_Horst> how the hell did that stay on youtube then
<prince-dari> Eh, it had some woman topless in it, which some other things I stream do has sometimes anyway
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well for starters it wasnt really pornographic, it was just weird, it was an accident and more explicit things have been streamed
<prince-dari> have*
<Dark_Horst> not that pornographic then
<twilight_sprinkle> youtube doesnt even have anything pornographic
<Shizuka> 13an MD wat
<BlazeAngel> She just ran out of air
<Goldframe> sad thing is, I actually still have an MD player
<Mutterguy> nah i bet she knows circular breathing
<Barbetos> "Lost mai musicku"
<Snowden> i like how they had that, her out of breath, added more reality to it
<Snowden> like, Ohm just sang your heart out, well, your perfextly ok, no sweat
<Barbetos> lol
<BlazeAngel> Who wants some barbed wire?
<Kandarihu> Later on, I looked at the entire video. The rest of the video was too creepy, even the 99% of it that wasn't porn. In short, mouths for eyes.
<twilight_sprinkle> BlazeAngel: me!
*BlazeAngel shoves barbed wire down twilight_sprinkle's esophegus, and out his/her anus
<thelonepony> i want some :3
<BlazeAngel> Graphic huh?
<Suzano> DAT ENGLISH
<Zeus> da hell
<Derpy_Hooves> BlazeAngel: any constantine wire?
<Shizuka> 13gratuitous english in japanese songs is usually... weird
<twilight_sprinkle> well... that escalated quickly
<Shizuka> 13especially if they aren't fluent
*Snowden drags twilight_sprinkle around with a magnet
<otakon> Shizuka: eeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
<BlazeAngel> Derpy_Hooves: Nah, but I have a rusty chevrolet.
<Suzano> yeah XD its so fun
<Derpy_Hooves> BlazeAngel: constantine wire is deadliest wire
<Kandarihu> Okay, okay. I guess I never set the no linking stuff at all in the main channel in stone, only the #Vinyl_Scratch honorban from posting links until it's been opened 30 times. I'm kind of cheating by counting yesterday moment as one instance, so it's 29 now
<Mutterguy> naot as bad as a Duckbunny Kandarihu. is it a Duck or a rabbit... no one can say for sure.
<BlazeAngel> Derpy_Hooves: Nah, Limewire is deadliest wire.
<Derpy_Hooves> can't argue with that
<Suzano> ok Bronystate... love you and all but this Gray pony needs sleep x3
<Ponies47> Night Suzano!
<Snowden> G'night Suzano
<Suzano> goodnight! Bronies Tight!
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: at least make it 3 times and not 30, 30 is several years
<thelonepony> Night Suzano :)
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, too late. That much is set in stone.
<Ace> Good night Suzano!
<BlazeAngel> Schoolgirls...
<BlazeAngel> Oooh.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: how can it be set in stone, its your own decision, not like its physical
<otakon> goddammit
<thelonepony> Kandarihu: tbh, i cant remember that video :$
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I made a promise.
<otakon> I keep getting buffer every few seconds and I don't know why
<otakon> alright gonna try clearing the cache
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Kandarihu: I think the important thing is that nobody cares~
<Shizuka> 13still leeching neighbor wifi?
<Snowden> otakon: hows your internet to the site?
<thelonepony> Lol
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: Oooh, ima do tha- DAMN THSE PASSWORDS.
<twilight_sprinkle> someone should open-close #vinyl_scratch 30 times so Kandarihu can keep his promise :P
<otakon> Shizuka: yes if you must know, my mom for some reason see's NO point of getting proper internet put into the house
<otakon> considering the fact that I would pay for it, installation and sevice
<Kandarihu> Seriously, I'm stretching it too much too much by counting yesterday morning. If you open it 30 times just for the sake of my honorban, I won't count it.
<BlazeAngel> One tree
<Zeus> a tree worthy of the gods
<otakon> and skippage again
<Snowden> otakon: pay to have your neighbor to have kick-ass internet?
<Shizuka> 13dat character development
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: then at least change it to 5 or something, seriously, 30 times is several years
<otakon> Snowden: no, I'm using my neighbors wifi and I want to get proper net but my mom doesn't want it installed since we have the neighbors wifi to work off of...
<Shizuka> 13HARUHI USED GRASS ATTACK
<BlazeAngel> Fail
<Shizuka> 13it wasn't very effective
<otakon> and still getting buffer
<otakon> I don't know why
<otakon> I just watched a 1h33m movie from YT at 360p with no buffer issues
<Ponies47> http://derpibooru.org/174501
<Kandarihu> otakon, if the internet bill is going to be in your name, it's your account, not your mother's.
<Shizuka> 13otakon: because youtube loads the video into your cache
<Shizuka> 13a stream is realtime
<Zeus> 360p is demanding
<otakon> bugger
<Zeus> isnt*
<thelonepony> Ponies47: mmphmphm?
<otakon> Kandarihu: true but that doesn't matter, she doesn't see the point of buying it if we can leech it. I keep telling her it's so we don't have to deal with NOT having it when her's goes screwy.
<Ponies47> thelonepony: mmphmphm!
<otakon> at this point I think I'll just turn my Tablet into mobile wifi and pay it off with debit
<thelonepony> mphphmm :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> teach your neighnor how to put a pass, can't longer leecht it, get internet
<Snowden> Rozen Maiden?
<Barbetos> oh no
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: no see, my mom doesn't use the net as much as I do and could care less if we didn't have it or not
<Barbetos> this song is going to be stuck in my head again
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Desu maiden
<Shizuka> 13oh desu
<Zeus> wow never seen this one before
<BlazeAngel> "Kneel down and lick the bitter tastes of love"
<BlazeAngel> Yeppers
<Goldframe> it got to odd for me halfway through the second season
<Snowden> Quick, i need a backstory.
<Goldframe> living dolls
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon pay for it yourself ?
<otakon> she won't let me get people in here to install it
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: http://derpibooru.org/82134
<Goldframe> there's your backstory Snowden
<otakon> okay is there an issue with anyone else's embed volume control?
<otakon> I can't turn it down
<Snowden> Goldframe: Living Dolls? Got it!
<Dark_Horst> otakon: does that, refresh
<Mutterguy> Snowden, you woke up in the strets with nothing but a barcode on the back of your wrist and an a generic jumpsuit.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon get a mobile card ?
<otakon> I have refreshed
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: still havent watched cromartie :P
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: like I said I'm going
<otakon> ogddammit
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: well, go watch it :D
<BlazeAngel> SHOW YOURSELF
<otakon> refreshing the page, this is getting annoying the volume control on the steam is acting up
<Snowden> Mutterguy: do i have anything in any pockets i may have
<BlazeAngel> Criminal scum.
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony i was hoping for a stream of it
<otakon> it won't stay where it's supposed to
<BlazeAngel> Give it to me.
<BlazeAngel> NOW
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: ah, well patience is bliss then
<Dark_Horst> looks like optimus hasn to get in line for that one
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony how long is it?
<Shizuka> 13uh oh
<Shizuka> 13suigintou is now xana!
<otakon> oh shit
<Mutterguy> just a piece of paper with an address. below it says FIND ME
<BlazeAngel> PURPLE RING
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: cant remember tbh :$
<otakon> it's the bitch!
<twilight_sprinkle> k
<Dark_Horst> does warratny cover that?
<otakon> and coma
<Zeus> Mutterguy: getting a Cry of Fear vibe
<Mutterguy> oh and the pice of paper is an expired coupon for Froghurt
<Dark_Horst> molested by a doll
<Dark_Horst> milestone
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: irony?
<twilight_sprinkle> also since we were speaking of several year bans, i feel like i should say this,imo it wouldve been better if we gave a chance to sonicandmario, maybe he wouldve been a cool guy
<Snowden> Mutterguy: go to this Froghurt of which you speak and ask for any wierd recent happenings?
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: Dark_Horst, maybe
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: he's more than welcome to start his own channel
<Dark_Horst> what irony?
<Shizuka> 13it's not hard to make IRC channels, just join one that doesn't have people in it yet
<BlazeAngel> Say shizu, where did thy get thy name?\
<otakon> Shizuka: but hasn't he been coming for quite some time?
<Shizuka> 13BlazeAngel: is my name
<aniderp|bestcakeever> who is the dark one?
<otakon> no idea
<otakon> I've missed too much
<BlazeAngel> I know that shizu, what is it from? Biblical, or what?
<Mutterguy> Nah the coupon is just a red herring.
<otakon> BlazeAngel: it's Shizuka
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: yes but he wanted to talk with the people here, he hasnt done anything wrong so far
<Zeus> ^
<otakon> except for being under age
*Snowden thinks
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: But you know how it goes in this chat
<otakon> and if you have your guardians permission you can come here
<thelonepony> randomness
<Snowden> Mutterguy: is the address close by?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: he did have guardian permission though
<BlazeAngel> Our hell... A land of broken PCs...
<Snowden> were talking cities, not blocks
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: he said he did
<Zeus> we're pretyy apropriate for an internet chat
<Kandarihu> Why was Sonicandmario banned anyway?
<otakon> Kandarihu: under age user
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: because he said he was 10
<otakon> he can ban appeal it however
<Kandarihu> Oooooh, I see.
<Mutterguy> you don't know. you remember very little.
<Valvad> What is playing?
<otakon> also we've had 10 year olds in here
<Dark_Horst> say there
<otakon> there was one last year
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: well he was honest enough to say he was 10, and getting parrental permission isnt something that needs to be lied about
<Dark_Horst> bottom of the stream window
<Valvad> Oh I see it
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: dont you remember when wrek stream that Episode of Bullshit? he didnt thought it through
<otakon> that's why Wrek puts the 18+ warning on it now
<thelonepony> i know
<thelonepony> seen it in school
<otakon> dammit
<otakon> stupid buffer
<thelonepony> Lol
<otakon> STOP PAUSING!
<Snowden> Mutterguy: Explore around where i woke up, look at the addresses to find out my relative location to the adress on the paper
<Dark_Horst> thelonepony: actually, what resulted from that was triggerhappyness on someone elses part. that episode was not more explicit than other things we had on stream. like, game of thrones or misfits (wich had been streamed the same week). nobody cared about that though
<thelonepony> Dark_Horst: ah yes, i heard that this place did stream those
<twilight_sprinkle> meh, imo the religion ep was way more flammable than the pornography one
<BlazeAngel> "Hahahaha"
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: true
<otakon> where is Pinkie when you need her?
<otakon> ...
<otakon> welp that's a mind break
<otakon> and BROKEN
<thelonepony> D:
<Mutterguy> Welll...As far you can tell it's on the otherside fo the city. Better stop here . Getting too much into RP for this channel.
<BlazeAngel> Owned by your mind.
<BlazeAngel> But dreams are a manifestation of our desires...
<twilight_sprinkle> Mutterguy: wrong channel?
<Snowden> Mutterguy: Ok, but that was good for on the spot
<twilight_sprinkle> this tune. it has drilled a hole in my head
<otakon> BlazeAngel: and our fears
<Zeus> +BlazeAngel: maybe to a Fruedian

<BlazeAngel> otakon: So? She's a doll
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ryunosuke: lol oh yeah

<otakon> and then the whipping began
<BlazeAngel> otakon: Modelled sure, but changes occur
<Barbetos> So what is this anime about?
<Mutterguy> Snowden we can probably continue, we better just take it elsewhere.
<otakon> magical dolls
<Zeus> BlazingAngel: yeah dude and fear is just the coward in you slowing your manlines down

<otakon> STuffy stuff
<Kandarihu> Alright. I'm going to permit myself to post links in the main channel in keeping with the rules. However, there was an important link I wanted to post about a week ago, that a lot of us would be interested to see. It actually pertains to something that's being released tomorrow.
<BlazeAngel> Zeus: Tab fail
<Snowden> Mutterguy: lets save it for another day. im really bad at RP's when im tired
<Mutterguy> Snowden okies
<Snowden> :D
<Zeus> ok im not gettin this tab stuff
<Barbetos> Kandarihu what is it?
<Barbetos> Forget the link, TELL ME!!
<Kandarihu> Mega Man X Street Fighter
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: does that include the vinyl_scratch honorban?
<Barbetos> Oh.. Huh..
<BlazeAngel> Anyway ever play MorrowWind?
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, like I said. That's the only thing that's set in stone.
<Barbetos> They made Mega Man look like that fat blue yellow thing did they not?
<Shizuka> 13morrowind is the best
<otakon> ^
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: YESH
<otakon> Shizuka: Dragonborn is good though, GET IT
<Barbetos> Morrowind mod for skyrim?
<Shizuka> 13i tried setting it up to stream but it crashes after like five minutes
<otakon> Barbetos: Dragonborn comes very close to it
<Barbetos> I can't wait for TES online honestly.
<BlazeAngel> Barbetos: What is the point of that?
<Zeus> i like oblivion a bit better but morriwind was good too
<Kandarihu> Barbetos, Rockman is the same as we know him. It's everyone else who's 8-bit.
<otakon> Shizuka: lower setting to minimum?
<Shizuka> 13wat
<Shizuka> 13no way
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: at least reduce it by half or something, 30 times is too long..
<otakon> also, NEW MEGAMAN ON THE 17th!
<otakon> and it's FREE
<BlazeAngel> Shizu, nice hustle tons-a-fun, next time eat a salad.
<otakon> Shizuka: well do you want to show it or not?
<DerpyMuffins> Are we watching chibi?
<Barbetos> Aight... Sooooo.. Where get Mega Man?
<Shizuka> 13otakon: the problem isn't the graphical settings
<Barbetos> I mean gototherightandjumpman
<Kandarihu> Barbetos, the Capcom Unity site.
<otakon> Barbetos: check the capcom site
<Shizuka> 13asuka doesn't bat an eye at the piles of shaders and enhancements modded onto it

<Shizuka> 13it's that the core engine is almost 10 years old
<otakon> Shizuka: yar?
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: Nice hustle tons-a-fun, next time eat a salad.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> whose streaming?
<Zeus> Shizuka: what do you mean its ten years old?
<Shizuka> 13morrowind is from 2003
<RDash5000> whats up bronystate!?

<twilight_sprinkl|afk> RDash5000: that depends on your choice of axis
<Zeus> it was 3
<Mutterguy> I think it was 2
<Snowden> heyo RDash5000
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: That reminds me of that engine that valve used. Forever.
<twilight_sprinkl|afk> and was that terrible joke, im afk~

<Mutterguy> I remember getting a budget copy in 2005
<Shizuka> 13goldsrc on the other hand is still pretty crap
<Kandarihu> The problem with posting the link now, is the question of being disrespectful to Shizuka or being disrespectful to SuperBrony64. I won't disrespect either of them.
<RDash5000> twilight_sprinkl|afk: you smartass you

<RDash5000> Spicy chicken is best chicken
<Shizuka> 13you know
<Shizuka> 13something i've noticed
<Prince_Lightstar> not in the mood 4 jappinese .-.
<the_real_pony_1604> adblock and adblock plus do nothing for safari on my mac. I had to install chrome just for freaking ustream stuff
<Shizuka> 13japanese songs never rhyme
<RDash5000> :O
<Snowden> 2cool2rhyme
<Prince_Lightstar> Shizuka: :O
<Shizuka> 13part of it i'm sure is because the language is primarily in the syllables, not single words
<Prince_Lightstar> 99% more intrested
<Barbetos> Why rhyme when you have rythem?
<RDash5000> then again, if they rhymed, they would probably be gibberish
<rdash> Shizuka: how would they...?
<Zeus> the_real_pony_1604: chrome is better anyway imo
<Prince_Lightstar> now im gone
<Shizuka> 13and most kanji have a couple different meanings
<Shizuka> 13now for all the feels
<QuinnThePegaSistta> oh god now the feels!!
<Barbetos> HAIBANE!!
<otakon> no more feels
*Barbetos squeels
<Shizuka> 13actually
<Barbetos> I mean.
<otakon> pelase no more feels
<Barbetos> ahhem
<the_real_pony_1604> Zeus, I don't like to install a bunch of stuff on my computers if I don't have to. it messes things up
<Kencolt> Shizuka: Well, Japanese musical tradition was less harmonic and more melodic. Songs were often less sung than recited to a melody. Even with the influence of Western musical styles, they still follow Japanese poetic traditions-- which rarely rhymed.
<Shizuka> 13no it's the next one that unleashes all the feels
<otakon> NOT THE FEELS
<soulrider95> Shizuka: Angel Beats level or...?
<QuinnThePegaSistta> NOOO dam add!!
<QuinnThePegaSistta> ad
<Snowden> opening theme: FREE BIRD!!!!!!!!!!
<RDash5000> Shizuka: will it induce feels in someone who has never watched this show?
<Shizuka> 13FREE BIIIIIIIIRED

<Goldframe> QuinnThePegaSistta: get adblock plus
<Shizuka> 13my spelling is awful today...
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: Giving it to SB nao?
<QuinnThePegaSistta> yay ad ended just in time
<Shizuka> 13wat
<Snowden> it will only get worse with time
<Zeus> Shizuka: back to school for you
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: I know.
<Snowden> Shizuka: leaving soon, whats the one with all the feels, or will ir be a suprise?
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: What am I saying
<Shizuka> 13reki's gone cold turkey!
<otakon> Shizuka: how little sleep have you gotten?
<Kencolt> Shizuka: Also, in general, Japanese doesn't lend itself to Western style rhymes, I believe. So, basically, it's not seen as desirable or needful. (The occaisional English phrase may well rhyme, tho. It works in English.)
<Wubstep> Guess who's back? C:<
<Barbetos> I need to go cold turkey myself
<Snowden> Wubstep?
<Barbetos> Smoking is a hell of a habit.
<Wubstep> What are we watching o_o
<BlazeAngel> Know what else is a hell of a habit?
<BlazeAngel> Cocain
<Goldframe> it's kinda funny that aBe went from the wtf-ness of Lain to Haibane

<Snowden> Haibane Renmei
<Snowden> says at the bottom of the screen

<Tassadork> I see... dead people?
