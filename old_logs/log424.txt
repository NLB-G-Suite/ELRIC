<RainBowJack> Ahole?
<Krakass> Legion was my 2nd favorite teammate after Garrus.
<cowvarkian> same here
<Sumica> 00,10Oh I have seen it already
<Sumica> 00,10it's funny but if you do reaper iff mission it starts the events for the end game
<Krakass> Funny reactions from the Quarians
<Alister> @Sumica : btw who is your romance in this run ?
<Shamroc> welp...im back...turned out i wasnt as tired as i thought..
<Krakass> The reporter
<Sumica> 00,10and if you do any missions after thse events start it meens you get there too late to save the crew
<Krakass> So if you don't save the crew from the collector ship is the memorial wall on the Normandy in 3 full?
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica so you get the bad ending if you do?
<junh1024-XD> A surround version of ANATO exists
<Scarlet> I cried when Garrus was on my memorial wall.
<Krakass> What?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Garrus is awesome.
<drf-Droid> :o
<Krakass> How did Garrus die?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Even if he's best dyer
<drf-Droid> on SACD?
<Shamroc> whoa what is happnin up in here..
<junh1024-XD> on DVDA
<drf-Droid> also, what's DSD? I see it mentioned for stereo
<Scarlet> He stayed behind to protect the elevator from seekers
<junh1024-XD> DSD is the coding used on SACDs
<junh1024-XD> it's worse than PCM
<Krakass> I'm sorry to hear that Scarlet
<drf-Droid> oh

*Digitalis huggles RainBowJack
<Phase4> valoreins, free distributed web cache
<Spectrum_Rush> valoreins: webhost of bronystate
<Phase4> its not our host, it sits infront of the host
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's a service where if a website is offline, they provide the cached version
<valoreins> i thought some DA user or something... :s
<Phase4> XD
<Krakass> It *should* increase uptime
<Spectrum_Rush> what they said^
<Phase4> Krakass, ikr
<Phase4> when the site does go down it caches the fact that the site is down, and breaks things
<prince-dari> So if NFS still having problems, or is it just us?
<prince-dari> is*
<Spectrum_Rush> oh Sumica is there anyway to change ones /nick password?
<Scarlet> dat AI

<Krakass> Deese nuts
*RankWinner wonders what 'VIB' stands for/means.
<Twi_Fi> Very Important Brony, probably
<RankWinner> Fair enough
<LightTrooper105_> hello everypony
<Cypresswolf> Phase4: 7 installation got as far as near the end of step 2 - gathering files, settings, & programs, then vista stopped it - error 0x80070570 - Error End fixed it...
<Twi_Fi> Hello LightTrooper105_.
<LightTrooper105_> wops let me change that
<LightTrooper105> there we go
<Twi_Fi> And hello LightTrooper105.
<LightTrooper105> lol hello Twi_Fi
<Phase4`> Cypresswolf: have you done a full disk scan? including searching for bad blocks?
<LightTrooper105> true
<Twi_Fi> Sundaysmile, if you have just entered a moment ago, then I say hello to you too.
<Cypresswolf> Tried again - got 2 minutes into copying all the files - error 0x80070020 - stopped again...-_- Ran Error End again...now installation wont run at all without "an unknown error"
<Sundaysmile> thanks Twi_Fi
<Sundaysmile> took forwever getting in, website's down apparently
<Phase4> Cypresswolf: run disk cleanup, i'm guessing that will fix that error
<Twi_Fi> Yeah, I heard from others that there were problems, but I didn't encounter any when I logged in.
<Phase4> i dont know why the site is slow
<Phase4> yeah, its usualy better than this
<Lighty> 06just woke up, almost 2 PM =W=
<RankWinner> Slow? The site bronysatate site doesn't even work for me :'(
<Twi_Fi> So, even though there is supposedly about 98 individuals in chat, in reality there is less?
<djpon3> In about ten minutes, guess what...
<Twi_Fi> Who is actually chatting on bronystate?
<TheRandomkid321> Im bak
<Twi_Fi> Hello TheRandomkid321.
<RankWinner> Welcome
<LightTrooper105> hello TheRandomkid321.
<Phase4> Twi_Fi: quite a few less, theres a few bots and lots of people just idle in this room
<Phase4> Contex[Away]: lol @ your nick
<djpon3> Sumica, ten minutes.
<Sumica> 00,10djpon3 stull no
<Twi_Fi> Ah
<djpon3> Sumica: ???
<Twi_Fi> Seemed like less were talking.
<JRP2234|webchat> sumica says nah
<Cypresswolf> disc cleanup complete...really dont want to run 7 again right now...I've lost count of its upgrade failures -_-
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Twi_Fi> Sumica says, "Talk to the hoof!"
*Spectrum_Rush hugs SuperBrony64|VIB for his awesome game sense
<Krakass> Cypresswolf, I take it you don't want to do a clean install?
<Cypresswolf> Vista shouldn't be this darn impossible to upgrade
<djpon3> Time: 6:55a Eastern/5:55a Central/3:55a Pacific.
<MadSurge> Ohai Bronystate! :)
<Twi_Fi> Been about 6 months since I last used Vista.
<Cypresswolf> Is that just clicking Install whent the 7 menu comes up?
<Twi_Fi> Hello MadSurge.
<MadSurge> Who's on? Sumica and SuperBrony64?
<Twi_Fi> MadSurge, yes.
<RankWinner> Yes.
<Krakass> Maybe? It's been awhile since I've installed 7. But it formats your HDD in the process.
<RankWinner> If you install W7 over a older windows install it moves all files into 'Windows.old'.
<djpon3> Pound
<djpon3> Puppies
<djpon3> three
<djpon3> minutes.
<Krakass> Nobody wants to watch pound puppies.
<RankWinner> ^ That.
<TheRandomkid321> I went on sloganmaker.com and typed in sumica and this was my result... Always the real thing, always Sumica.
<Krakass> Not in two minutes, not in one minute.
<Sumica> 00,10Lol
<MadSurge> Infamous is a pretty good sandbox series.
<TheRandomkid321> Im 13 and I wish I had an NES.
<djpon3> Now less than 100 seconds.
<MadSurge> Retrogames are the best ones, graphics are secondary.
<Krakass> Stop spamming the fucking pound puppies
<RankWinner> Having graphics isn't a bad thing, the first Crysis was awesome and had godlike graphics.
<djpon3> 1 minute!
<RankWinner> Crysis 2... no. Just no.
<djpon3> Pound puppies fans here, go turn on your TV now! Becasue it's in less than 1 minute!
*Twi_Fi is listening to both chat and Party With Pinkie at the same time.
<Phase4> graphics are a tool for artists
<ZombieBrony> Gameplay should come before graphics
<MadSurge> Rhythm Heaven is actually my current favorite Nintendo series!
<MysteryPony> lol graphics has always been a selling point!
<Sumica> 00,10lol nope
<Sumica> 00,10it's a new thing
<TheRandomkid321> I must say graphics are a nice touch to a game but I hate people who are all like WHY WOULD YOU WANT A NINTENDO THE GRAPHICS SUCK CRYSIS 2 IS THE BEST! Crysis 2 is not a good game (in my opinion) and tehy just fool people with good graphics.
<Phase4> MysteryPony: untill recently that mattered. consoles were limited
<Phase4> now everything is powerfull enough it doesnt matter
<RankWinner> On a side note, Crysis 2 was a bad game and it also had sub-par graphics.
<Phase4> and yeah, music is overlooked
<Digitalis> Hell i love video game music
<ZombieBrony> Crysis 1 was awesome, Crysis 2 was meh
<djpon3> Sunday April 29, 2012, 7:01am.
<TheRandomkid321> Whenever I play BF3 I always need to put music on.
<Phase4> games are not all about gameplay, its a multimedia expeience and if any aspect is lacking it reduces the whole
<Cypresswolf> -_- I'm going to look up some patterns on AC wild world, to ponify my game - then I'll give 7 another run...a few hours from now...6 am is too early for that aggrivation
<Twi_Fi> Phase4, dat philosophy.
<Krakass> Sumica likes to smile, smile, smile
<MadSurge> In Crysis 1 it was great to mess with the guards and throw shit at them :D

<TheRandomkid321> Spectrum_Rush besides that small look and why is teh stream down... Im sure he is just doign something.
<Cypresswolf> I bought windows 7 last summer and every couple weeks since then I've attempted installing it - Vista is ---- near impossible to upgrade in my view
<Spectrum_Rush> oh thennevermind
<Krakass> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDvvPYsTXm0
<RankWinner> How come Cypresswolf?
<Cypresswolf> Vista keeps making up or finding new errors to stop the upgrade process
<TheRandomkid321> The stream is down for everyoen whiel he does his thing right?
<RankWinner> Yep
<Cypresswolf> all it takes is 1 to stop it
<Krakass> Yes, just like he said it would
<Sumica> 00,10gimi just a moment
<BronyinJapan> Hello everypony
<Phase4> Cypresswolf: its tourmenting you
<TheRandomkid321> Cypress wolf. What did you pay for Windows 7?
<RankWinner> You could try just backing everything important up on a external drive and formatting your current drive.
<MadSurge> Hey BronyinJapan!
<Cypresswolf> yes, Phase4, soo much - the flames, flames, flames...all over my face....
<Twi_Fi> Hey BronyinJapan.
<TheRandomkid321> Hello BronyinJapan. Or shoudl I say. BronyinJapanこんにちは
<RankWinner> Hiho BronyinJapan
<BronyinJapan> Does any pony want a copy of Modern Warfare 3 and Gears of War 3 for the Xbox 360?
<Phase4> Cypresswolf: have you tried installing by booting the dvd instead of running from within windows?
<Krakass> BronyinJapan, I'm not getting naked for them again.
<Phase4> google sugests its missing files
<BronyinJapan> ?
<TheRandomkid321> BronyinJapan なし
<BronyinJapan> What?
<RankWinner> o_O Cypresswolf you were trying it from the windows install? Argh :O
<BronyinJapan> Nashi?
<Krakass> You probably don't want to know.
<Cypresswolf> Phase4: I didnt know that was a possibility
<RankWinner> xD How did you think people without OS's installed Windows?
<JRP2234|webchat> Cypresswolf: the down side is you would need to formate frive
<SuperBrony64|VIB> 11,02MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Phase4> dont need to format
<JRP2234|webchat> drive*
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Moo
<RankWinner> Just pu the CD in and boot. You'll see a 'choose boot device' or something along those lines
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02MOO
<Phase4> windows offers an upgrade from the boot dvd
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02MOO
<TheRandomkid321> MOOOOOO

<Twi_Fi> Moo?
<Phase4> chat needs more moo
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Moo O.O
<RankWinner> And you don't have to format your drive at all
<TheRandomkid321> MOO!
*Phase4 hugs SuperBrony64|Zzz "sleep well"
<Malavolent> Moo is now a canon.
<RankWinner> Er, Moo?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Mooooooooooooooooo
<Krakass> Woo
*SuperBrony64|Zzz hugs Phase4 "Moo ^-^
<Twi_Fi> Mooing is against my beliefs.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02:<
<Sumica> 00,10Sorry for the delay
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Moo
<TheRandomkid321> alrighty
<MadSurge> ;O
<MadSurge> *:O
<TheRandomkid321> wow...
<Twi_Fi> The moos have spread!
*Spectrum_Rush yay
<Barrel_of_Fun> what is this?....?!!??!
<Sumica> 00,10voice of eps
<RX-78-SweetieBot> @moometer regulars channel
<Steven_Magnet> 6 regulars channel is 22% moo. (1287)
<Krakass> It's like a virus
<TheRandomkid321> BARREL!
<Twi_Fi> Silent film version?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Its not that bad yet
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ Silent ponies
*TheRandomkid321 throws Barrel_Of_Fun
<Barrel_of_Fun> heya TheRandomkid321
<MadSurge> Music! :)
<Phase4> Cypresswolf: its a little faster than from windows but you cant do much while its installing, timed it at 20 minutes to first boot once. depends on how fast your pc is
<RainbowAsh> Someone needs to remake this in the style of early silent movies with talking cards
<Krakass> %moometer manechat
<Sumica> 00,10so show you just how much background music is taken for granted
<Sumica> 00,10and how music sells a shot
<ZombieBrony> It's like one of those black and white movies
<Twi_Fi> A vaccine for moos......
<Krakass> %moometer manechat
<Twi_Fi> What could it be?
<Krakass> Command is spelled wrong
<RainbowAsh> MY LITTLE PONY
<Krakass> I just noticed that
<MadSurge> Echoing vocals :D
*Spectrum_Rush friends
<Phase4> when you dont realise the background music is there and it improves the show anyway is when its done right
<Krakass> Who's script is Steven_Magnet?
<Krakass> %moometer manechat
<ScootaChicken> @12_year_oldmeter manechat
<Steven_Magnet> 6 manechat is 46% 12_year_old. (1291)
<MadSurge> Who did this editing job?
<ScootaChicken> Not high enough.
<Phase4> someone should do this but pull out sound effects
<RX-78-SweetieBot> its early in the us, most of them are asleep right now, so thats probably accrate
<Phase4> like the birds
<RX-78-SweetieBot> accurate*
<Twi_Fi> How do you know the age?
<TheRandomkid321> the birds give it such a relaxing feel
<Princess_Cadence> Hey
<derpy_pony> hey
<Krakass> Bye their actions
<Sumica> 00,10that would require acess to the raw tracks
<Twi_Fi> Wow, my mind is full of bananas.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Its more of a maturity thing than their actual physical age
<derpy_pony> what's this? background music focus?
<MadSurge> Eeyup
<Malavolent> Interesting indeed.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> MEntal Age if you will.
<Krakass> Hey, I have an idea. Let's demand Sumica stream Pound Puppies.
<TheRandomkid321> derpy_pony yes. And congrats on winning the lottery.
<Twi_Fi> I have never realized how the background music has that much of an effect.
<Princess_Cadence> Woo
*Spectrum_Rush headphones on volume max LESDOTHIS
<MadSurge> Derpy XD
<Phase4> Twi_Fi: you dont, thats the point
<Sumica> 00,10they got the suround sound encodes and killed the front channles and boosted the rear channles
<Twi_Fi> Then what is my mental age?
<PrincessDismo> :l Why can't I hear anyone talking?
<ZombieBrony> I can barely hear the voices
<Princess_Cadence> These ponies are so cool
<derpy_pony> they rerolled 5 times, until finally my name came up, TheRandomkid321 ^^
<Phase4> derpy_pony: why the 5 rerolls?
*Phase4 wishes he had seen that
<Princess_Cadence> Spitfire is sooo wrong there
<Krakass> @twi_fiagemeter
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 8% twi_fiage. (1292)
<MadSurge> PrincessDismo: It's edited to focus on BGM
<derpy_pony> this is winning how I like it. because the other movies where trolling or b material
<Krakass> Hmm, that didn't come out right.
<Princess_Cadence> Spitfire has different hair colors
<Twi_Fi> wut
<PrincessDismo> MadSurge: Oh, Cool. :3
<Krakass> I think it means you're 8.
<Spectrum_Rush> such dramatique
<derpy_pony> one choice was mlp the movie for example
<Twi_Fi> How did it know!
<Twi_Fi> I mean.....
<Sumica> 00,10SB and me got to talking how music can can be a huge part of things
<TheRandomkid321> So I guess grannys hip was eventually fixed...
<Sumica> 00,10especaly background music
<Sumica> 00,10and how it makes things so much beter even if you dont notice it
<Twi_Fi> This is how season 3 will be.
<derpy_pony> any way to filter out the background music and watch without it?
<Princess_Cadence> Any Ideas for season 3?
<MadSurge> Mute Pinkie? What witchery is this?
<Twi_Fi> wow
<TheRandomkid321> umm ow
<Sumica> 00,10yeah you could do that if you had 5.1 or 7.1 audio versions of the eps
<Barrel_of_Fun> now that i can pay attention to the music, this song is really cute :D
<Twi_Fi> This is actually very interesting.
<Sumica> 00,10not many people seem to know that some one did this
<ScootaChicken> I call them '12 year olds' as a sort of maturity level.
<ScootaChicken> I'm sure most of them aren't actually 12.
<Sumica> 00,10so I like to share it
<Malavolent> I can imagine how little attention gets anyone who makes these sounds?
<MadSurge> Princess_Cadence, now I hope that since they pulled out a member of the fair folk, they do a Nuckelavee villain :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica link if possible?
<ScootaChicken> But it's a catch all remark, and it fits.
<Cypresswolf> Princess_Cadence: I have 36 ideas and counting for Season 3 already :)
<RainbowAsh> Sumica, this is amazing. I never noticed the little cues before.
<Twi_Fi> And I'm 8!
<Krakass> Some claim to be 14 but act like 7.
<derpy_pony> it's the same in video games. graphics are massively overrated. the musicians provides half of the experience. many indie developers neglect this
<derpy_pony> wow
<Krakass> And spell like 6.
<somepony_else> i just came here... is this kind of a silent movie-version of the episode?
<Invi> guddn moin everypony :)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Because if we were actually calling people out on their physical age, then ScootaChicken would have some problems
<Malavolent> Roayal wedding, heh.
<somepony_else> hi Invi
<Princess_Cadence> :[ <-- This is how i look like when Applejack Is just using his apples and talking about saving Grannys hip or fighting with Rarity.
<Spectrum_Rush> morn Invi
<derpy_pony> guddn morgään
<Twi_Fi> Hello somepony_else and Invi.
<Krakass> ScootaChicken has an exemption
<Sumica> 00,10http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL80234CDEE4D84E87&feature=g-user-a
<MadSurge> Hell, Journey is pretty much all music and graphics and it's a great game to explore
*Invi hugs somepony_else Spectrum_Rush and Twi_Fi
<ScootaChicken> RX-78-SweetieBot: If I was calling people out because of their actual age it would be hypocrisy at it's finest
<Cypresswolf> Rarity's dress in her fantasy wedding looks close to the dress Cadence wore
<Invi> moin derpy_pony ^^
<RX-78-SweetieBot> exactly
*Spectrum_Rush hugs Invi back
<TheRandomkid321> Wait. She has a nephew.. How does that work?
<Sumica> 00,10it's all of s1 with voice off eps
<Welsh_Pony> hurricane fluttershy and putting your hoof down had really great bgm.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Zzz

<Barrel_of_Fun> Wait just a minute!
<ZombieBrony> DASH TALKED???
<Cypresswolf> Princess_Cadence: :) What?
<Krakass> Dash is 20% louder
<BronyinJapan> Does anypony want a copy of Modern Warfare 3 and Gears of War 3 ?
<Sumica> 00,10she was off camera so was part of the background track
<Invi> Dash broke the wall of silence
<MadSurge> Dash is too loud to be muted! :D
<RX-78-SweetieBot> oooo, mini marathon of pound puppies on hub
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02I want MW 3 :D
<Spectrum_Rush> dat excalation
<Malavolent> Sumica: Accidentally learning.

<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02:3
<BronyinJapan> For the Xbox 360
<somepony_else> amazing... i never noticed that there was so much music in the background
<Princess_Cadence> :( Oh im sorry if i interrupted you..

*Twi_Fi is hungry.
<Invi> mei tooh

<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Twi_Fi: O U

<alexxm> what are we watching
<Sumica> 00,10tree house has thicker more solid walls so there is less echo
<Spectrum_Rush> does any keep hering aww come on spike
<lolol> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Ill sell you some terrible wii games for £10 each
<derpy_pony> yay
<Malavolent> Sumica: Damn, I wish I could highfive anyone who thought of that.
<somepony_else> without the voices this song is even more surprising :D
<Malavolent> Too bad you won't notice it in show.
<RainbowAsh> I also miss the abundance of Pinkie songs out of nowhere
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02That still cost a lot to ship :(
<Dark_Horst> the fun thing is, fluttershy actually did it because she wantec to help a friend. then angel happened
<Spectrum_Rush> wooooow

<derpy_pony> in texas she could shoot them all
<TheRandomkid321> YOU B!ITCH!
*Spectrum_Rush lolol booooo~
<Barrel_of_Fun> i like how they put a lot of echo indoors, that isn't really something you can really notice
<Twi_Fi> Rainbow Dash is a jerk.
<derpy_pony> relief
<Invi> Twi_Fi why?
<Sumica> 00,10but the thing is it's always around Barrel_of_Fun
<lolol> shouldnt she give one to spike, and one to herself?
<Rage-Bit> Why is the music louder as usual?
<derpy_pony> why did he need a window?
<Princess_Cadence> :O WHAT DID YOU DO TWI?!
<Sumica> 00,10and you would notice if it was gone even if you could not figure out why you would just feel it was wrong
<Twi_Fi> Invi, she was dancing and singing about how she was the one who was going to get the tickets.
<lolol> why cant we hear the retching?
<TheRandomkid321> Knew she had 6 friends. Only gave her two tickets. TROLOLOLOL
<RankWinner> And so trollestia was born.
<derpy_pony> jackpot
<lolol> its a background noise
<Princess_Cadence> ;) Yay They get to go all in there wait
<Princess_Cadence> SPIKE?
<Princess_Cadence> :S
<TheRandomkid321> AHHH!
<Twi_Fi> voices
<RankWinner> Dashie being loud again xD
<lolol> why didnt celestia just send 6 tickets?
<Spectrum_Rush> haha
<Rage-Bit> dat face.
<Barrel_of_Fun> i wonder if other shows put so much detail in their sound
<Twi_Fi> chortling
<Spectrum_Rush> dat giggle
<Rage-Bit> ohgod louder laugh.
<TheRandomkid321> what does chortle mean?
<lolol> Barrel_of_Fun: they do
<PrincessDismo> WE FUCKING LOVE PONIES!!!!!!!!!!
<Princess_Cadence> 6_9 DAT FACE APPLEJACK.
<Sumica> 00,10I would bet no
<somepony_else> lolol: because she's a troll
<derpy_pony> many shows do, Barrel_of_Fun, you just rarely notice it
<TheRandomkid321> BARREL!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I wish more people in this fandom would try watching pound puppies instead of just going "hurr durr seekret butt fuuun lulz"
<Rage-Bit> Why is the background music louder as usual?
<Spectrum_Rush> TheRandomkid321: its a type of laugh
<Sumica> 00,10i think things like this add alot to why people like the show and cant realy figure out why.
<ZombieBrony> Never knew backround music was that awesome
<RainbowAsh> lolol, maybe it's usually expected to bring a date instead of a gang to a gala like this
<Rage-Bit> wat
<Krakass> I liked it more when the show was called Hogan's Heroes.
<RainbowAsh> Moar
<Twi_Fi> Wait, I just realized, we watched a whole episode.
<Rage-Bit> utueb
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol
<Invi> ^
<derpy_pony> most of the emotional guidance in the show comes from the music
<Lasharus> That's the important part to quality products Sumica. The combination of the whole. If the sound's bad, good acting won't save it, and vice versa.
<Sumica> 00,10exactly
<Rage-Bit> wat
<lolol> applejack has a REALLY long neck in that front shot
<alexxm> can any one else not hear the voices
<Sumica> 00,10which is why I am glad you are all likeing this as well
<Lasharus> They managed to strike the right balance for this series, which is one of the reasons for the huge fanbase.
<lolol> alexmm yeo
<Twi_Fi> I don't care for pound puppies.
<Rage-Bit> alexxm thats the point
<Krakass> alexxm, that's the point
<Princess_Cadence> DAT FACE :$
<RainbowAsh> AAAAAAA
<Rage-Bit> LOUDAAAA
<alexxm> sorry Rage-Bit and Krakass
<lolol> Rage-Bit, Krakass shit snapples man!
<Rage-Bit> wut
<Spectrum_Rush> Fance
<Princess_Cadence> LOUDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Rage-Bit> That echo makes it awesome
<Krakass> You're just to fast lolol
<lolol> alexxm: you better be sorry >:C
<Lasharus> It's definitely an interesting idea Sumica.
<Twi_Fi> My little ponies, you are missing the point!
<Krakass> too*
<Sumica> 00,10noticeing AJ has a bit of a theme song too.
<alexxm> i am lolol
<Lasharus> You mean 'banjo'? :P
<derpy_pony> stampeeede
<Rage-Bit> random yay
<ArcusLuna> ^_
<lolol> Lick my feet alexmm
<Cypresswolf> how many series has the fanbase thereof actually modified episodes of just to hear the background music? I love this fandom :)
<Rage-Bit> MOOO-
<Princess_Cadence> rainbow!!
<Spectrum_Rush> ebrebrberberbbrebrbebere
<Rage-Bit> >general chaos
<Twi_Fi> That is all.

<lolol> why doesnt winona or opal ever talk?
<CrazyCherry> 'Ello everyone!!
<Princess_Cadence> INSTEAD OF HAVING CAKE
<Krakass> I wonder if that's there even in other locations like the everfree forest
<lolol> its evident that most animals can talk in this show
<derpy_pony> hillbilly leitmotif
<Sumica> 00,10enough with the all caps
<RainbowAsh> lolol, pets don't talk for some reason
<alexxm> hey CrazyCherry hows your day been
<somepony_else> i was just wondering the same Krakass
<That_British_Guy> So...what is this exactly?
<lolol> but ponies are technically a pet!
<lolol> and spike is a pet!
<Krakass> Who has a pet pony?
<derpy_pony> they are technically rubber ducks
<lolol> rich people
<Sumica> 00,10I like dashes theme here
<Twi_Fi> Krakass, who doesn't!
<Spectrum_Rush> ponies ar technically marhmallows
<RainbowAsh> lolol, in the real world yes, but in equestria they are the dominant sentient species
<Krakass> Me. :-(
<MadSurge> Oh this scene :D
<Twi_Fi> Dat music.
<That_British_Guy> dat rainbowdash's face
<MadSurge> Pinkie :D

<KwakLad> Oh nearly silent movies have never been so good
<That_British_Guy> Fluttershy: *trollface*
<CrazyCherry> Well that sucked!
<Princess_Cadence> Lol

<Princess_Cadence> WAAA
*RankWinner puts hand up.
<That_British_Guy> dem eyes
<RankWinner> Yes CrazyCherry, why?
<Krakass> Well it's 0630. I should probably go to bed or at least try to get a nap. You kids enjoy your ponies.
<MadSurge> I am CrazyCherry
<alexxm> i am CrazyCherry
<Barrel_of_Fun> haha, the bgm is so goofy here
<lolol> I think that ponies were dominant in a previous universe, then twilight destroys the universe to spare everyone from a terrible infinite torture from an infinatly powerful luna/discord/god type figure, then universe compresses, and make a new big bang, that gave us the universe we are in now, more realistic and with humans
*Twi_Fi skipped movie night like a boss.
<RainbowAsh> Woo!
<Spectrum_Rush> woo
<alexxm> cya Krakass
<That_British_Guy> Dat wall of words
<CrazyCherry> Just askin'!
<Princess_Cadence> ..is AJ drunk?
<CrazyCherry> 'lol'
<ZombieBrony> Me after pulling an all nighter watching ponies
<Spectrum_Rush> sleep dprived
<Sumica> 00,10punch drunk perhaps
<CrazyCherry> "lol"
<Phase4> being sleep deprived is like being drunk
<lolol> but luaran faust is a surviving pony that cant remember her past life and was remade as a human, and is now discovering her memories and episode plots
<CrazyCherry> hmmmm.....
<That_British_Guy> too much cider i suppose :/
<RainbowAsh> lolol, that thing Twilight saved everyone from must have been really, really terrible if humans were the better alternative
<Princess_Cadence> yep
<CrazyCherry> [lol]
<CrazyCherry> not that either
<Princess_Cadence> ALL THE HUNGRY PEOPLE LISTEN:
<Twi_Fi> lolol, I question your hypothesis.
<MadSurge> :D Pinkie was barely hearable there :D
<alexxm> am i done now lolol
<lolol> RainbowAsh: no she saved all the ponies from infinite torture and misery from this new ruler
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: if thats so i dont see what all the fuss about getting wasted is
<Princess_Cadence> IM EATING CHOCOLATE ICE CReAM RIGHT NOW
<CrazyCherry> ¨lol¨
<CrazyCherry> herp
<lolol> the human genetics and realistic no magic physics are just random
<That_British_Guy> HA! Get it!? "What on Earth is that pony doing?"
<CrazyCherry> -lol-
<Twi_Fi> Princess_Cadence, I is jealous.

<Twi_Fi> One side effect of alcohol is.........DEATH.
<Princess_Cadence> I made muffins yesterday
<That_British_Guy> THEY TALKED!
<CrazyCherry> How do you do the thing that everypony uses for something they do?
<somepony_else> sleep deprivation can also lead to death
<RainbowAsh> So much teleportation
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: i wouldn't know entirely i've only been 21 one for seven hours now
<Phase4> lol
<lolol> RainbowAsh this is INFINITE, meaning if she didnt, they would be tortured for an INFINITE pain for an INFINITE amount of time, killing everyone and the evil figure would relief them from having to go through that
<RainbowAsh> Spectrum_Rush, oh, happy birthday then
<MadSurge> Well happy birthday then!

<MadSurge> Because MTV isn't about music anymore :D

<Digitalis> Those were good times
<Monfang> Everyone knows that you don't go to MTV for music anymore.
<Princess_Cadence> :[ Not again
<Phase4> you go to the internet
<CrazyCherry> You're welcome your Majesty!:)
<Rocklobster> MTV is depressing now

<Monfang> Easy one.
<Monfang> Need to find some cross season ones.
<MadSurge> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1982/ realistic Applejack and Applebloom :D
<Phase4> the fun bit is when you add in my largest change, static files + url rewriting
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9-N16CkNs
<Phase4> site reaches 2.3k requests a second on my laptop
<That_British_Guy> Oh and btw....The war that im not allowed to mention to any of you so im not bringing it up...has rewards :D http://misterz100.deviantart.com/art/Loving-morning-297519951?q=gallery%3Amisterz100%20randomize%3A1&qo=0
<Princess_Cadence> XD
<Radu> Count the words Luna said in normal voice in both seasons.
<Radu> GO
<TrixieMuffin> What did RD try to use as leverage in that episode, to make Fluttershy come see the dragons?
<Radu> The fact that she also went to some kind of Butterfly thingy?
<TrixieMuffin> correct
<Ascendant> ):
<Radu> Count the words Luna said in normal voice in both seasons.
<Radu> GO
<Phase4> Radu: 11 not including the haloween episode
<Monfang> Define normal
<Radu> Oh my.
<Radu> You're good.
*Phase4 is counting from memory
<Phase4> wait... 12
<Phase4> missed one
<Monfang> Not counting the halloween episode?
<That_British_Guy> Normal? NORMAL!? What is "Normal?" :P
<Radu> Did you count "Halt! Who goes in there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle..."?
<Monfang> "I missed you so much big sister" from season one
<Phase4> Radu: wouldnt call that normal
<Monfang> "What did I miss?"
<TrixieMuffin> normal as in not canterlot ?
<Phase4> Monfang: i was remembering that wrong
<Radu> Yup
<Monfang> "Rest, My Sister. I shall Guard the Night."
<Phase4> Monfang: the second one i remembered as "hello, did i miss anything"
<Monfang> That's most likely it
<Radu> Wasn't it Hello everypony, did I miss anything?
<Monfang> And "Who Goes there! Stay inside Twilight Sparkle!"
<Phase4> TO THE VIDEOS!
<Radu> Halt^
<Monfang> Yall pay more attention that I do.
<Radu> xD
<Monfang> Maybe I should rewatch all the episodes just for the heck of it
<Twi_Fi> Still more quizzing?
<Radu> Eeyup
<Phase4> "Hello everypony, did i miss anything" is the correct line
<Radu> We're trying to count how many words Luna has spoken in non-canterlot voice
<Radu> After this, I got a blast
<Monfang> As in not volume boosting
<Princess_Cadence> Rest My sister,as always i will guard the night
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2RBsBOOgMc - Pinkie Pie IS WATCHING!
<TrixieMuffin> Madame mayor , thy princess of the night hath arrived
<Monfang> That's it, Cadence.
<Spectrum_Rush> hmm seems kyrospawn is uploading the finale clips now
<Radu> Okay, okay. When you're ready, next one coming.
<Monfang> I knew I was missing some part
<Phase4> "i'm so sorry, i missed you so much big sister" is the line from ep 2
<Monfang> Wait!
<Phase4> or ep 1 part 2
<Monfang> I got one no one can answer!
<Phase4> depending on how you number
<Radu> Okay new one:
<Monfang> .....
<Monfang> A warning would be nice.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> she may have boosted the "halt who goes there..." part, since she was way up in the tower, needed a voice boost for twilight to hear her
<Monfang> I was just trying to keep up
<Radu> How many times has Trixie reffered to herself as "The Great and Powerful Trixie"?
<Phase4> Radu: all the times
<Monfang> I shall guess... 6
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Monfang: its an automatic thing
<Monfang> 6 times
<Radu> Moonfang, I think way more
<Monfang> Better to undershoot it than overshoot it.
<Phase4> what number is boast busters again
<Radu> 5, wasn't it?
<Very_Silly_Filly> 5
<That_British_Guy> http://misterz100.deviantart.com/art/Loving-morning-297519951?q=gallery%3Amisterz100%20randomize%3A1&qo=0 THE PINKIE PIE ARMY IS INVADING!
<Phase4> ah nvm, have to get back to my code anyway
<RainbowAsh> 6
<RainbowAsh> 5 was Griffon the Brush-Off
<Dark92Enigma> What's up everypony, this is your favorite #Enigma saying: SHOW_ON
<Radu> Ahaha, sorry for keeping you busy Phase4 :p
<Monfang> British guy, I do not approve
<Phase4> Radu: its not a problem, need a bit of a break
<Phase4> theres much less actual coding than you might think
<Monfang> I am of the mindset that you do not ship an OC character with a canon character.
<Radu> Okay. Count the squees in both seasons.
<Radu> Go, they're not many
<Monfang> 7
<Phase4> most of your time is spent figuring out how things are suposed to work
<Radu> Moonfang: You sure?
<Monfang> No
<Very_Silly_Filly> BEEEEEEEZ. How do they work?
<Monfang> But I'm going 7
<Phase4> freking wordpress and its hyper complicated actions system
<Radu> I think it's 5
<Monfang> Don't you have the answers?
<Phase4> more than 5
<Very_Silly_Filly> Boast Busters is 6
<Radu> EEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee nope
<That_British_Guy> To pass the time heres a short story
*Randomnerd rises from his grave and kills headless zombies
<Monfang> Then why are you asking the questions?
<That_British_Guy> 15,000 BC: Humans scavage for food and avoid being eaten by predators.1982: 'My Little Pony' is created2012: A grown man watches ponies prance about on the most sophisticated network ever devised.
<Phase4> Radu: a positive integer that is greater than zero
<Radu> Indeed.
<That_British_Guy> 2078: Matrix created.2078 and one day: An old man enters the matrix to﻿ spend the rest of his life prancing with ponies.
<TrixieMuffin> Who does Spike get the ball from in secret of my excess?
<Twi_Fi> What pony does this remind you of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKRgktzRvZ0
<Monfang> Ok, I got a question that no one can answer:
*alexxm licks lolol
<Radu> Oh my.
<lolol> keep going
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm off online on MK7, lets see how much I fail ')
<Monfang> In what scene.. did we see two of the main cast kiss?
<Spectrum_Rush> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gMlhCcwElI&feature=plcp
<Spectrum_Rush> Little Girls:﻿ Oh no, Princess Celestia is mad at Twilight! I'm now feeling somewhat sad!Us: Freaking bawling.
<alexxm> when can i stop lolol
<DavidCortez> Monfang: Rarity kisses Spike
<Spectrum_Rush> reactions to that^ scene
<Very_Silly_Filly> I wasn't bawling
<Monfang> Spike isn't part of the mane 6
<Very_Silly_Filly> I was pissing myself laughing
<lolol> when i say you can
<Phase4> Monfang: i'm trying to think, there was one that looked like a kiss iirc
<DavidCortez> you said mane CAST not mane 6
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICteTrd1UkY - contains psycho twilight
<Phase4> spike has no mane, your argument is invalid
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (eXAKR10) 11WB10»11•. 10- Nah, I ate the scanner this time
<Radu> Mickedly Split?
<Radu> I cheated :p
<Twi_Fi> In the Mare Do Well episode it looked like Applejack and Rainbow Dash may have kissed.
<Monfang> Nope.
<Spectrum_Rush> rainbow dash and fluttershy during epic changeling fight scene
<Monfang> Try again.
<Monfang> DING!
<Twi_Fi> Also, it looked like Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash may have kissed in the finale.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> only crazed shippers think any of them mane 6 have kissed in any scene
<Radu> I got it?
<Monfang> The animation doesn't show it, but there is a short kissy sound when Fluttershy kisses Rainbow Dash on the nose just to taunt the shipping fans.
<Monfang> *'kisses'
<Monfang> No, Rush got it
<Phase4> because its on my mind: when twilight tackles twilight in the changling battle and it turns out the real one was on top, that was awesome
<Spectrum_Rush> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2gwezImLME
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, ah but Sumica slowed down that scene for us and we all analyzed it. There was no actual kiss, sadly.
<Princess_Cadence> Its Twilight sprakle not Twilight.
<Phase4> you just naturaly assume she's the one that got tackled and the shows like 'nope'
<Monfang> I said that. The animation doesn't show it
<Dark92Enigma> Monfang......the main cast......OH you mean that scene where Fluttershy was surrounded by RD clones, but the real RD KO'd the clones, and then she lifted up Fluttershy, that looked like a kiss
<Monfang> However, there is that sound.
<Princess_Cadence> Twilight is: AAAAAAAAAH THE HORROR THE HORROR! Twilight Sparkle is: YAAAY!
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, yes true. The sound is indeed there.
<Phase4> wondered what that sound was
<Monfang> it was a perfect tease
<Spectrum_Rush> ha i got it
<Twi_Fi> I think Rarity and Fluttershy would be a good couple.
*Twi_Fi waits.
<Digit|ArtMode> ....
<Monfang> I don't think any of them would make a good couple with the other
<Digit|ArtMode> I have nothing to say on that matter
<RX-78-SweetieBot> crazed shippers everywhere
<Princess_Cadence> ugh
<MadSurge> I think only bromance works with the mane six
<Princess_Cadence> celestia is calling me
<Whiskra> they're all best friends, they're all girls, therefore they must be lesbian
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km1YqjzIsJE
<Princess_Cadence> brb
<Radu> They didn't kiss
<Radu> They just poked their noses
*CrazyCherry is back
<Whiskra> acctually, rd's snout was at the side of fluttershys the entire time
<MadSurge> Ikr Whiskra
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Radu: dont try arguing with the crazed shippers, you cant reson with them
<RX-78-SweetieBot> reason*
<Digit|ArtMode> lol
<Dark92Enigma> Princess_Cadence You said it. If Twilight (Sparkle) would say ''Please don't hate me'' I would say: ''HOW could I hate you?'' and then i would pick up one of the Twilight books (which i don't have BTW) and i would say'' YOU, ON THE OTHER HOOF''!!!!!!!!
<Digit|ArtMode> wtf
<CrazyCherry> Dangit GilDash isn't here yet.
<Dark92Enigma> Radu: It looked pretty much like a kiss, however
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGboyipxUU - Ponies in my attic
<Princess_Cadence> wait Celestia is calling me.
<Princess_Cadence> brb
<Spectrum_Rush> i'm not shipper, i mean i can find the matter cute but that about the extent i'll go
<Princess_Cadence> back

<Radu> D'aaw
<Twi_Fi> The finale has now established the power of love. It is only natural that to increase the power of the Elements of Harmony that friendship be discarded and replaced with love.
<Radu> Also dat link
<Dark92Enigma> OK take your time Princess_Cadence!
<Twi_Fi> The board is now set for season three.
<MadSurge> Twilight is dumb romance for stupid girls-
<Spectrum_Rush> Twi_Fi: *takes off glasses , my god
<Dark92Enigma> Twi_Fi Maybe LOVE was the missing Element of Harmony.
<Spectrum_Rush> no

<CrazyCherry> GilDash
<Princess_Cadence> Hello Gildash...?
<RainbowAsh> Monfang, sure
<GilDash> @CrazyCherry: Fashionably late? ;)
<pony_zen> Hi CCCP long time no ABC
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<Monfang> Treating Celestia and Luna as 'goddesses'
<Monfang> That is my number 1 peeve
<Lighty> 06humpadumpabumbzzzzhup
<GilDash> Princess_Cadence: Hello, Princess! How was your wedding?

<Monfang> They have done nothing worthy of making them 'deities'
<Princess_Cadence> Very good Glad you asked GilDash :)
<pony_zen> Lot's of greetings here today I see
<Invi> moin FillyFlam
<CCCP> this is creepy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPSY9QLNRY0
*LightTrooper105 sips tea
<Monfang> Stop treating them like they are.
<GilDash> pony_zen: It's like I'm popular. :O
<Randomnerd> Monfang: They do raise the sun and moon

<MadSurge> NO YOU'RE NOT PINKIE PIE, IMPOSTOR!
*Digit|ArtMode rubs temples
<Randomnerd> Monfang: That doesn't necessarily make them GODS, but it certainly implies they have powers beyond mortal mares.
<Digit|ArtMode> i feel a headache coming
*CrazyCherry is confusseld
<Invi> Digit|ArtMode drink a lot ^^
*Spectrum_Rush GOES BACK TO vectoring... woops canterlock
<RainbowAsh> Monfang, well, there is some backing of them in the show, for instance when ponies say "Celestia is my witness", which is of course derived from "God is my witness"
<CCCP> MadSurge: XD
<Randomnerd> They're Superheroes! :O
<Digit|ArtMode> lol xD
<GilDash> pony_zen: But stars are really hot... Oh...
<Princess_Cadence> lol what?
<Digit|ArtMode> I haven't drank enough, I want some more hot chocolate
<MadSurge> Only Andrea is Pinkie Pie :D
*CrazyCherry continues to kiss GilDash
<Invi> Digit|ArtMode especially alcohol, so you have the headache later xD
<Monfang> You mean like how they said int he middle ages "The King as my Witness"?
<pony_zen> Gildash: :O
*GilDash snuggles against CrazyCherry.
<Digit|ArtMode> Nah I don't drink that stuff.. err yet
<Princess_Cadence> ..?
<pony_zen> WHERE IS CANADA!?!
<Chrysalis> hey guys
<Princess_Cadence> OMG
<pony_zen> you are not Canada
<GilDash> pony_zen: We must find him!
<RainbowAsh> Monfang, I wasn't aware of that. It's understandable how people could confuse that at least.
<Invi> moin Chrysalis
*CrazyCherry Snuggles back to GilDash
<GilDash> pony_zen: It will be our grand quest!
<MadSurge> Although there's a lot of chicks that can do a very good Pinkie impression, and that's awesome
<Invi> Digit|ArtMode or use the force of caffeine ^^
*GilDash noms CrazyCherry's ear.
<alexxm> hey Chrysalis hows your day been
<pony_zen> GilDash a Quest, you say?
<thegt90> hey anyone know any good car chase scene
<Randomnerd> "King and Country" and "God and Country"
<Digit|ArtMode> Ah i do feel like having coffee, but it gives me terrible indigestion for some readon
<CCCP> i looove ponies
<Digit|ArtMode> *reason
<Randomnerd> thegt90: Bullitt.
<pony_zen> For Celestia and Equestria!
<Princess_Cadence> omg its Chrysalis :O
<thegt90> yes love that one
<Invi> CCCP mee toooo
<DeRpy4Eva> Hey hows everypony
<Digit|ArtMode> I've still never figure out why
<CrazyCherry> pony_zen: I'm the new Canada remember?
<Invi> hi DeRpy4Eva
<Randomnerd> Hi, DeRpy4Eva
<MadSurge> I don't like coffe, only fizzy drinks :D
<CCCP> hi DeRpy4Eva!!!!!!!!!!! :D
<Espeon> 06Umbreons. that is all
<pony_zen> Yes 'New Canada', but you are still not 'Canada'
<Randomnerd> MadSurge: You're missing out
<DeRpy4Eva> hello
*CrazyCherry noms GilDash's mane.
<GilDash> @CrazyCherry: But it's just not the same... Sorry...
<Invi> Digit|ArtMode I have that too, but i grnore that ^^
<pony_zen> It's like York versus New York.
<Lighty> 06breeonzz
<Digit|ArtMode> Ah so I'm not the only one, lmao xD
<Invi> *ignore
<Digit|ArtMode> but it bothers me D:
<RainbowAsh> Monfang, also ponies don't seem to have any god at all. Considering that monarchy is usually founded by a divine connection, the princesses could be the highest spiritual beings in existance in the pony belief system, which would coem somewhat close to god-ness
<Princess_Cadence> chrysalis..
<Invi> Digit|ArtMode caffeine is laxative, that could be a reason ^^
<CrazyCherry> Whelp i hope Canada comes back...
<Chrysalis> yes?
<Digit|ArtMode> O_O
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: So do I. :)
<pony_zen> Well... She controls the sun... that's more than we have seen in any religious systmes we have
<Litwick> Careful Cadence, textwallls can get you banned.

<Kandarihu> Well, failing an IQ test... so in other words, you ranked low?
