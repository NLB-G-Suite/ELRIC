<Aircrafter> Its...Impossible o_o
<djackson> you know whats more awesome, the comment question of the day which comes from a user anmed BAM and he says
<MasterBrony> may i have a hug Princess_Luna?
<Jim> I know right, I remember playing Heroes 3, and this looks so much better (even though HoMM3 is a classic)
<Princess_Luna> Yes you may MB.
*Princess_Luna hugs
*MasterBrony returns hug
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Is that Heroes?
<flutter_spin> And I'm like Pinkie. I looked at the description and striked through what wasn't me. I ended up with "I love parties... and I'm creative... but I love parties"
<Jim> Yes SB
<MasterBrony> its so good to be a grown alicorn again?
<Aircrafter> Parties are good.
<Ingwaz> SuperBrony64: i think its heroes 6
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I need to get that game...but my computer probably isn't cool enough to handle it :/
<djackson> i have ponies... on my screen
<BronyKing> HELLO BRONYSTATE
<Aircrafter> Looks like Fallout 1 and 2...But better graphics.
<Jim> ohai BronyKing
<Princess_Luna> How are you an alicorn though? Another dimension? Way to make me feel worse about being a filly MasterBrony...
<LadyCanary> Hihi BronyKing
<flutter_spin> Only part of me like Rainbow Dash is that I'm loyal.
*LadyCanary has a delicious candy bar that her sister bought for her. Feels good~
<fluttercry> 05,15I took that personality test, and I got ZERO in common with rainbow dash
<flutter_spin> hehe
<MasterBrony> im an alicorn, so when i do marry Luna
<MasterBrony> we are the same species
<Princess_Luna> I wouldn't think I had any in common with twilight or Fluttershy...that isn't right...
*mario_pony has soup couldn't be happier
<djackson> @superbrony64, your PC can run skyrim it can run anything (like mine)
<The_4th_Wall> which test?
<Princess_Luna> Remember what I said MB?
<flutter_spin> http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=MjUxOXwxOTEwMTg

<MasterBrony> WOW
<djackson> true
<MasterBrony> self centerd much?
<Aircrafter> I'm taking the damn test again.
<MasterBrony> not you
<MasterBrony> the REAL Luna
<Princess_Luna> What?
<flutter_spin> I'm surprised I'm like Rarity, but I do obsess over little details
<mario_pony> i got fluttershy yaay~
<MasterBrony> what?

*Globetrotter "I'm doing rather well. I'm off on an adventure tomorrow, so I've been busy sorting things out. I've got a bit of headache though."
<Aircrafter> Lol...Just a total gap away from rainbow dash Fluttercry.
<LadyCanary> D'awww fluttercry :3
<Phase4> fluttercry: woah
<Princess_Luna> fluttercry, that is an uncanny formation...
<RAWRity> so, it's firmly established that fluttercry is NOT Rainbow Dash.
<Phase4> no rainbow dash? not even a little
<Tarku> yay fluttercry
<fluttercry> 05,15None. I was expecting Fluttershy and Twilight to be high though
*Globetrotter "I was 100% rainbow dash, and 100% applejack"
*Globetrotter "and 50% Twi
*Globetrotter "Does that make me 250% pony?"
<djackson> that reminds me of a song
<flutter_spin> I really haven't seen anyone be like Rarity, unless they like fashion
<Aircrafter> I wonder what would happen if you got 100 percent on all of them...
<Princess_Luna> You can't be, because that would be 250% which is impossible.
<Tarku> eyup Globetrotter
*Globetrotter "ALL THE PONIES!"
*Phase4 things Globetrotter should /me less
<djackson> amnesia the dark desent. that guy on his friends list will die soon

*Globetrotter "Not a problem my dear fellow, Phase4"

<Phase4> suddenly http://youtu.be/8QVlTWTxO4U
<Ingwaz> Globetrotter: a very odd result, especially if you answered as honestly as you could. While applejack and rainbow dash are both fiercely loyal, beyond that and their athleticism, theyre very different ponies
<djackson> at night

<[SWAG]thehated5689> where does one take this personality quiz?
<unfoundbug> http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/
<Ingwaz> rawrity, was that intentionally done?
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: no
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You might like it.
<flutter_spin> http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/
<The_4th_Wall> But seriously, Task Manager not responded. So, did that mean my computer was basically a heated coaster at that point?
<RAWRity> just me answering truthfully.
<flutter_spin> lol. I had like 30 tabs. Maybe I should close some
<Ingwaz> how can someone embody such extremes of multiple personalities in one mind?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it is an MP game, so maybe people here can join me.
<Jim> that might be the problem
<Ingwaz> game of what Nittany_Discord?
<Jim> sounds interesting Nittany_Discord
<unfoundbug> what game?
<Jaketehsnake> Is this Heroes Of Might and Magic? a new One?
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: I'm a very complex individual.
<The_4th_Wall> just went from chrome AND firefox, 12 tabs each, to just chrome, 5 tabs
<Aircrafter> Nittany_Discord Has gotten my intention of wanting too see this mp game >_>
<flutter_spin> I'm very much like Twilight, just I don't like reading books.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's nothing new, but you might still like the stream.
<Ingwaz> RAWRity: perhaps you are, but i cant hardly see such 4 wide personalities to the extreme of their original element
<Jim> Jaketehsnake: This is Heroes 6
<Saturn> 08,01anyone streaming currently?
<unfoundbug> Wrek is currently streamin
<Wrek> 05bugger took out most of my forces :C

<Ingwaz> RAWRity: i'm not sure if thats your average, or the actual average of users all over
<robotdragon6> i just finished god of war 3 for today
<flutter_spin> Do they still have Bastian sale for $7
<The_4th_Wall> His. dammit
<Saturn> 08,01hey fluttercry, is it on steam?
<MasterBrony> i finished the test 4th wall posted
<Jaketehsnake> Dang. Dem Graphics!
<MasterBrony> i got RD
<Ingwaz> i'll have to take the test again and see how it matches up to your average
<ScootaChicken> Okay Imma stop lurking now...
<ScootaChicken> hi everypony ^_^
<fluttercry> 05,15no but someone showed a video and it was freaking hillarious
<MasterBrony> hay 4th
<unfoundbug> hiya chicken
<Aircrafter> Heya ScootaChicken....
<MasterBrony> is there a way to post my score?
<robotdragon6> EEY wussup
<Jim> hi ScootaChicken
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: the dotted line is the average user, the purple is me. So for 3, I'm only slighty more like RD AJ and TS than most.
<djackson> amnesia? it is on steam
<flutter_spin> Milky Ways part gets me everytime
<unfoundbug> fluttercry its hillarius to everyone BUT the person playing
<unfoundbug> that game messes with your head
<djackson> amnesia is on steam
<fillyfillyy> is Wrek the one streaming
<fluttercry> 05,15I like games like that
<flutter_spin> yeah, it scares you bad.
<Jim> I still want that game tho
<flutter_spin> I wouldn't want to play it
<Saturn> 08,01fluttercry: ah, okay. if it was on steam, i'd have gifted it to you; i still have credit left from christmas that i'm not gonna spend
<robotdragon6> im partly like rainbow dash, mostly like applejack and little bit like fluttershy
<Jim> Don't know why, 'cause I hate to get scared ^^
<otakon> I'm back
<unfoundbug> i went in expecting scary even after watching a letsplay still got me everytime
<Aircrafter> Its like watching a grown scottish man with pink hair in a tootoo spinning in circles in front of you.
<Jaketehsnake> OHAI OTAKON
<fluttercry> 05,15oh Saturn I thought you said Stream, oh it's on steam
<Jim> Welcome back otakon
<fluttercry> 05,15And you don't have to do that
<Saturn> 08,01Aircrafter: actually, i have a gif of that somewhere
<djackson> http://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/
<Aircrafter> Dont please Saturn.
<Jaketehsnake> Saturn, you are far too kind!
<ScootaChicken> hey Saturn, could you recommend a haircut for me?
<MasterBrony> http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=NjUyMnwzMTE
<ScootaChicken> I need to get one tomorrow
<Saturn> 08,01fluttercry: you sure? seriously, i ain't gonna spend it on anything
<flutter_spin> The reaction videos of that game are great. Watched one of a scottish lady freaking out when mere ambient sounds were around her.
<Saturn> 08,01i don't play games
<The_4th_Wall> Over the graph, there's a link to this
<The_4th_Wall> i think that's it
<Saturn> 08,01ScootaChicken: mohawk
<Saturn> 08,01bright green
<ScootaChicken> dear god no
<ScootaChicken> I tried a mohawk once
<ScootaChicken> never again
<Aircrafter> You go into amnesia expecting millions of monsters and puzzles, but there is hardly any monsters at all till you get later in game.
<fluttercry> 05,15I just can't accept that. But that's a really generous offer. Thanks.
<Jim> oh my, I just got back 500 EUR from the scout assosiation
<TheDr> hello everypony :)
<robotdragon6> my favorite walkthrough that i saw was dead space by hateworkboy on youtube
<robotdragon6> hey
<LadyCanary> Hihi TheDr
<flutter_spin> I hear that. Its less than 10 hours too?
<Jim> ohai TheDr
<MasterBrony> http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=NTEwNXwxOTExMTQ
<ScootaChicken> meh, I'll probably get a Beatles haircut

<djackson> id like gotham city impostors. Nudge Nudge, Wink Wink
<Saturn> 08,01fluttercry: ach, fair enough. if you change you mind, feel free to PM me and i'll sort you out a copy
<Aircrafter> If you want good freakouts on youtube, Check Out Psychadelicsnake.
<otakon> when did Fluttershy close?
<Red_Pegasus> Aircrafter: You still get scared when a clusterbuck of sounds come in the game in the beggining.
<fluttercry> 05,15I'll think about that
<MasterBrony> here is the link to my Brony score
<MasterBrony> http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=NTEwNXwxOTExMTQ

<TheDr> these fillys need food^
<Red_Pegasus> MasterBrony: You are 0% kind....
<Aircrafter> Red_Pegasus: Seen plenty of walkthroughs, its scary because you always expect a monster too pop out when there is the music. BUT IT. NEVER. HAPPENS.
<RAWRity> So far, My chart is still the biggest!
<djackson> i havent eaten in an hour
<Jaketehsnake> Ima Go make NACHOS!

<Phase4> youtube! y u break over ipv6
<flutter_spin> Would be cool to play Portal 2 with someone
<MasterBrony> im actually a very nice person
<Devaner> Then you realize that the game is just trying to be scary.
<Aircrafter> Devaner: But the music is what makes the game so good. You just cant turn it off and continue. You have too have it.
<The_4th_Wall> 20% cooler, Slightly more hyper than proper, not very well-read, a bit of a hard worker, and not shy at all
<Saturn> 08,01Aircrafter: http://adb39.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/smallspin.gif

<Aircrafter> RawketLawnchair: You should totally use it...See what happens.
*fillyfillyy glomps Jaketehsnake for capitallizing my name and then activates macrowave for 3 minutes on half power which BTW is perfect nach cooking
<robotdragon6> mom?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> yes?
<unfoundbug> older commercials were just so catchy
<SayWhat> fluttercry: All the time
<Ingwaz> RawketLawnchair: thats actuall a shampoo that women use as well, its supposed to strengthen your hair and help it grow
<Derpy_Hooves> i have guest coming so its up to you guys

<fillyfillyy> cha cha cha chia!
<RawketLawnchair> An orc?
<TheDr> fluttercry: its because that stuff is in your long term memory it happens to every one
<Princess_Luna> Hi %Nittany_Discord !
<Flutterdash> SWAG
<SayWhat> I have short term memory loss
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi princess of the night.
<TheDr> that sux :P
<The_4th_Wall> So, good commercials = stored in time capsule?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> flutterdash: hmm?
<SayWhat> But at the same time, i'm a genius :P
<unfoundbug> Nittany_Discord, what happened to the game you was talking about/
<Princess_Luna> So why do you have a percent instead of an @ or +?
<otakon> hiya Nittany_Discord!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I'm new.
<otakon> Princess_Luna: half op
<Princess_Luna> Oh...K?
<otakon> + is techie
<The_4th_Wall> hop status
<otakon> @ is full mod
<Princess_Luna> OK.
<TheDr> what do the @,+, and % mean is that like rank or something/
<otakon> or adminitstrato
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can do most mod stuff, but I'm not above the @'s.
<otakon> TheDr: yeah, basically
*The_4th_Wall facehoofs
<TheDr> cool
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The ranks dictate powers in the channel.
<mario_pony> what is the difference between a half op and a mod?
<Princess_Luna> So how do you get the newsletter for here?
*SayWhat facehooves but hits himself by accident
<prince-dari> Ok.
<diddutz> TheDr: + means talk power, % means half-op and @ means full-op
<The_4th_Wall> done that before
<diddutz> thats wat i was told
<robotdragon6> just took the test unfoundbug linked im most like fluttershy and applejack
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Half-ops can do what ops can except Op others (I think) and kick any op.
<RawketLawnchair> Nittany_Discord is only a B rank user. . . his power is still incredible!
*fillyfillyy heals SayWhat with friendship
*SayWhat is all better
<The_4th_Wall> is there a Jeopardy! stream available
<The_4th_Wall> ?
<mario_pony> Nittany_Discord: what different powers do half ops and mods have?
<TheDr> who do you become an ops?
<MasterBrony> http://silentwulf.com/pony.htm
<[SWAG]thehated5689> Princess_Luna: ask one of the mods, thats what i did
<MasterBrony> oopss
<TheDr> how*
<MasterBrony> damn cntrl v
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When we open up applications for mods.
<TheDr> cool
<flutter_spin> I've been trying to look up ad-blocking, but doesn't seem to be a solution
<otakon> it is
<fillyfillyy> good excuse MasterBrony ;D
<otakon> I use it it works fine
<SayWhat> Same
<MasterBrony> well
<The_4th_Wall> i didn't play that but that kinda looked staged for what it was
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01flutter_spin: AdBlock Plus
<MasterBrony> its true
<Aircrafter> Dem Castle Walls.
<MasterBrony> that was an accident
<fillyfillyy> lol okj
<flutter_spin> Plus? hmm. Maybe.
<otakon> nice MasterBrony but it's okay since this isn't an "official" stream atm
<The_4th_Wall> assuming 'damn ctrl+v'
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also mario_pony, Both % an @ can kick and ban and change channel modes, but I think only @ can op and half-op others.
<unfoundbug> surely its a ctrl-c issue not a ctrl v
<robotdragon6> this is the only chatroom i actually visit:S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, %'s can't kick or ban @'s.
<The_4th_Wall> so, like i said
<The_4th_Wall> is there a Jeopardy! stream available
<TheDr> robodragon6: me to
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01ctrl+v = paste.
<fillyfillyy> so the order goes % + @????
<The_4th_Wall> no
<mario_pony> oh good to know Nittany_Discord also why would you wanna kick or ban a mod?
<fillyfillyy> or + % @
<The_4th_Wall> glue=paste
<robotdragon6> yeah im shy like FS
<unfoundbug> yes, but ctrl v would of worked fine, putting whats on the clipbaord to the chat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Other than for fun.
<mario_pony> lol
<TheDr> so by the transitive prop ctrl + V+ glue
<Red_Pegasus> Did he say Raggle Fraggle?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or to stage a coup.
<Princess_Luna> ???
<diddutz> fillyfillyy: + % @I think, thats the order in the chat-member-list-thingy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<TheDr> =* wow i cant stop failling to day i blame the flu :(
<mario_pony> Nittany_Discord: coup?
<CriticKitten> Nittany: Technically anyone with ban permissions can set a ban that would effect someone above their rank, unless I misremember my IRC stuffs. It's the actual physical KICK that ops can't do to higher-ranked ops.
<fillyfillyy> ok kool diddutz
<Morty> whats up bronystate?
<SilverSonic> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to SilverSonic for 7 minutes
<[SWAG]thehated5689> + < % < @ ?
<Jim> ohai Morty
*The_4th_Wall feels like being a parasprite(isgiddy) but not want ban
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Hi Nittany_Discord
<[SWAG]thehated5689> and heyo morty
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: voices and up are exempt from bans anyway
<CriticKitten> When they're in the channel, yes.
<Morty> does anyone remember what episode this is?
*SayWhat says what
<Morty> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju61D6u404g&feature=related
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi TOY_PON3|Drawing
<Princess_Luna> (+<%<@)/0=undefined.
<The_4th_Wall> lool
<Jim> No no no man, you're making me fall asleep. It's say whaaaaaaaat
<mario_pony> whta is coup?
<flutter_spin> nope. still ads.
<ScootaChicken> mind you, I saw LordCelestia kick Ghosties last night during a +m
<CriticKitten> But that's not what bans do. They're meant to keep people from coming back to a channel. :p
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Princess_Luna: Btw just to let you know your mane is from season 1 not season 2
<ScootaChicken> and Ghosties is a full op and LC's still a halfie
<The_4th_Wall> coup is the rebel alliance
<prince-dari> hops can't kick ops.
<flutter_spin> I'll just deal with it.
<Princess_Luna> I know, it isn't glowing now...stupid ancient spell books...
<prince-dari> If LC kicked Ghosties, he wasn't identified for his nick.
<Ulthane> Morty "Owl's well"?
<prince-dari> So he wasn't opped.
<CriticKitten> In theory (at least on another network I frequent), you can set a ban on the channel's owner while he's gone, for example, you just can't actually kick him while he's there. :p
<Morty> o yeah i think thats right
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Good cause I have no idea how to draw season 2 mane :)
<robotdragon6> i couldnt remember
<Shizuka> 13channel founder is exempt from everything
<Morty> why didn't scoots become dash's assistant?
<prince-dari> You can ban any hostname.
<Shizuka> 13so long as they're idented with nickserv
<LadyCanary> Shizuka! :3
<prince-dari> Including founder's.
<mario_pony> prince-dari: what is coup?
<ScootaChicken> who is the channel founder?
<prince-dari> I am.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> so many questions
<ScootaChicken> prince-dari: then how come you don't have a tilde as opposed to an @?
<unfoundbug> which is why we respect his authority implicitly and incur no rath to be removed from this chat
<Shizuka> 13shadowircd doesn't set +q and +a for those ranks
<Shizuka> 13unreal ircd does
<prince-dari> ^
<CriticKitten> dari: See, I thought I remembered that correctly. It's the *kick* that is restricted by setting, right?
<robotdragon6> Is darth vader my father?
<TheDr> can only mods stream?
<robotdragon6> 6_9
<MasterBrony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc&list=PLDF1B4C469E6308E9&index=21&feature=plpp_video
<prince-dari> CriticKitten: Since as Shizuka said there's no +q/+a for owner and protected, the other ops can still kick me.
<ScootaChicken> ah
<[SWAG]thehated5689> TheDr: eeeyup
<prince-dari> Even though I'm woner.
<flutter_spin> too much responsibility for me. Just as long as I don't get kicked.
<prince-dari> owned*
<CriticKitten> Yeah.
<prince-dari> owner*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gamsurge has a detailed chanserv bot that does userlevels.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Only mods have the power
<SayWhat> Woner
<SayWhat> New word of the day
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Woner you say?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It must run off of a different IRC server client altogether.
<TheDr> hmm
<prince-dari> God dammit.
<Morty> MasterBrony: Thank you for that excellence
<flutter_spin> would you stop with the 20% cooler space link
<ScootaChicken> prince-dari is a wonely woner
<MasterBrony> youre welcome
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are no %, +a, or founder there.
<MasterBrony> :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just @ and +/
<CriticKitten> Knew that, I was more talking about the difference between ban and kick. I seem to recall that ban is just a way to block entry, it can't be enforced with a kick if the person outranks you. And they could just lift said ban then, anyways. :p
<MasterBrony> this link is the new rickroll
<MasterBrony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc&list=PLDF1B4C469E6308E9&index=21&feature=plpp_video
<prince-dari> Well there was no % on ponychat a while ago, but it has since been added.
<CriticKitten> At least if I'm remembering it right.
<mario_pony> i got kicked once
<unfoundbug> why did i click the link???
<mario_pony> for spamming
<SayWhat> Stop it with the space link
<The_4th_Wall> one of these days i'll end up with 8 tabs of that vid
<MasterBrony> LAWL RICKROLLD
<SayWhat> Spaceroll'd
<The_4th_Wall> IDEA
<MasterBrony> this is now canon
<Princess_Luna> I got kicked once...or twice...didn't actually spam, just threatened to...
<Jim> But I like the space song
<CriticKitten> Don't know for sure since different networks and setups tend to do it differently. I just know how it worked on another network I frequent. XP
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> I prefer Derp Roll'd
<flutter_spin> :'( you aren't supposed to be mean to me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXZ2YXpICPc&list=LLzf2Qht__r8QG9sbQ9mEhGA&feature=mh_lolz <- Enjoy this while I clean my apt.
<mario_pony> la la la la laaaa lalalalala la la la
<Shizuka> 13in any event, irc clients recognize +q, +a, +o, +h, and +v as the five ranks of user, just depends on what ircds make use of them
<unfoundbug> awesome link
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A friend made it.
<Shizuka> 13in the RFC, only +o and +v are defined
<Aircrafter> Oh my god WIN.
<SayWhat> ENJOYING IT
<The_4th_Wall> Space is 20% + Wheatley + Space core
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Nittany_Discord: Oh I seen that on your tumblr :D
<fillyfillyy> same here TOY_PON3|Drawing
<Lasharus> I see those idiots at UbiSoft still haven't fixed that bug in Heroes VI.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Lasharus> Increase combat speed = squeaky creatures.
<Jim> To go with Nittany_Discord's video: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-lets-get-to-that-party-quick.gif
<Aircrafter> I'mma get on firefox so I can infinite loop this.
<CriticKitten> Lasharus: Fix? Bug? Ubisoft?
<TheDr> this is a spam threat hoofs in the air where i can see em dont any pony move!!!!! :|
<Lasharus> Point.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Jim: Humans...really?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft.
<Lasharus> I just found Heroes VI rather a disappointment. :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*me bawls*
<robotdragon6> they look freaky
<TheDr> only really got into 3
<robotdragon6> they look freaky
<fillyfillyy> Nittany_Discord will you link me to your tumblr?
<SayWhat> Needs more lawl
<MasterBrony> AJ looks high
<robotdragon6> they look freaky
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wouldn't touch an Ubisoft game with a 10ft pole.
<TheDr> after that they took out the lich unit which was my fav :P
<Lasharus> I decided the same recently Nittany_Discord.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://www.tumblr.com/blog/nittany-tiger
<Aircrafter> alright...Now whats the name of the video again ._.
<mario_pony> Nittany_Discord: how about 11ft
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe 50ft.
<fillyfillyy> request denied
<SayWhat> Whaaaaaa
<TheDr> you always need liches and skeletons
<flutter_spin> I don't get mad at companies. I look at their game result.
<The_4th_Wall> same here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://nittany-tiger.tumblr.com/
<CriticKitten> Lasharus: Not a surprise. I think Heroes 5 is likely to be the last salvagable one in the series since it's the first one Ubisoft made and thus is the last one to be made BEFORE Ubi had a chance to screw virtually everything up.
<robotdragon6> oops sorry about saying that 3 times, my computer glitched
<TheDr> is tumblr any good?
<LadyCanary> :D Ah Nittay you has tumblr?
<LadyCanary> Nittany*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I get mad at companies that screw gamers over, which is pretty much any AAA publisher nowadays.
<fillyfillyy> yes TheDr you should get one too
<CriticKitten> It's likely to continue downhill from here, albeit slowly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft is one of the worst though.
<LadyCanary> I have one too ^-^
<CriticKitten> Nittany: Blizzard?
<Wrek> 05imo, the 6th isnt that bad
<Lasharus> UbiSoft is immensely bad at it. Their DRM is astonishingly bad.
<unfoundbug> Id say activision is worse thoguh
<pony_7733> Or activision or EA
<fillyfillyy> i think i just fellt my brain move when i sneezed
<Lasharus> Here's a fun fact:
<TheDr> fillyfillyy: i have no idea what i would do on it tho
<unfoundbug> poor infinity ward
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate Activision less than I used to.
<fillyfillyy> TheDr i request your assistance
<CriticKitten> Wrek: It does have some good features to it.
<unfoundbug> EA is pretty good atm
<Lasharus> On january first, their uplay servers were down. People contacted UbiSoft to get it fixed.
<TheDr> fillyfillyy: what do ya need?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA bans people from playing games.
<flutter_spin> I know certain companies get bad rep, but I objectively look at their product. Then again, their product reflects their rep
<CriticKitten> But I don't think it's as good as 5, myself.
<Lasharus> Not happening. Why? Well, Tech Support'd gone home for the weekend.
<robotdragon6> i like EA
<Lasharus> ...
<pony_7733> One ruined C&C and one money whored COD
<diddutz> i like trains
<CriticKitten> And it's likely to just keep getting worse, sadly.
<The_4th_Wall> Gearbox is very good about their customer service
<Princess_Luna> Gearbox is great.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> treyarch gave me zombies. theyre alright by me
<fillyfillyy> TheDr: cut my head open i need you to look and make sure my silly filly brain is where it should be i felt it moce
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA is trying to be a third parent.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They are Orwellian with their titles.
<The_4th_Wall> have you seen the claptrap marraige proposal?
<Princess_Luna> No
<unfoundbug> that was best proposal ever
<pony_7733> Either way the only games i buy from them now are Mass effect and few other good titles
<TheDr> "cuts into fillyfillyy's head" yeps its still there
<Lasharus> Frankly, I think I'll just avoid EA/UbiSoft for the time being.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And don't get me started on Online Passes.
<Jim> That was awesome, yeah The_4th_Wall
<SayWhat> Black March, onboard
<Derpy_Hooves> johnjoseco is online on DA be ready for him to join soon
<pony_7733> Activision is a no no i will never buy shit from them again
<Lasharus> EA's screwed over enough series for me, and UbiSoft's DRM pissed me off more than enough.
<fillyfillyy> is it connected correctly TheDr?
<The_4th_Wall> my jaw literally dropped
<Lasharus> Who's playing btw?
<Aircrafter> I just hope they make a new fallout, and it actually is more apocalyptic than the crap they call new vegas.
<CriticKitten> Nittany: I hate Blizzard nowadays mostly because it's decided to do things that are distinctly bad business practice, but gets away with it because the games are still pretty good and generate absurd cash.
<Princess_Luna> I must leave, goodbye!
<Ulthane> DRM?
<Jim> bye Princess_Luna
<TheDr> by a long cord of happy nerves? yes!!
<SayWhat> I think Wrek is
<diddutz> cu Princess_Luna
<flutter_spin> For example: I know Bethesda is known for having a lot of bugs, but I still liked Skyrim for its setting
<The_4th_Wall> So, anyone else preordering Borderlands 2?
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Um okay, later Princess_Luna
<Princess_Luna> My username will still be here though!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CriticKitten: That's the story of every game publisher now.
<Lasharus> Ulthane: Digital Rights Management. Essentially anti-piracy programs.
<TheDr> to bad i dont know how to close this head :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They all get away with everything they do.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Just go on my DA, it will be uploaded there
<Ulthane> oh
<Jim> I'd love a borderland 2, yeah
<robotdragon6> my computer's being wierd. ill see you guys later.
<flutter_spin> I dislike Turbine & Cryptic for the F2P services, but I still like the game
<fillyfillyy> TOY_PON3|Drawing link me to your DA?
<CriticKitten> Blizzard's the worst offender now, though. Diablo 3, now with forced DRM for everypony!
<Lasharus> Anything from CD-keys to UbiSoft's astonishingly bad always-online bullshit.
<SayWhat> Borderlands 2 For the Fricken win
<Lasharus> CriticKitten: UbiSoft got there first :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because most gamers don't know or don't care about not buying from them.
<pony_7733> Only dev and publisher i trust is valve
<TheDr> bbc in a sec
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> http://joviebear94.deviantart.com/
<The_4th_Wall> BL2 has been public for a while, Jim
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I trust Valve and indie companies.
<Lasharus> And I'll give Blizzard this much: At least they can be more or less relied on to keep the bloody servers online, as opposed to UbiSoft.
<flutter_spin> I played Diablo 3. The charm is gone.
<CriticKitten> Lasharus: Yes, but Ubi can't forcibly shove it down people's throats like Blizzard.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Same here
<Jim> yeah, I know, but I'd love to play it
<pony_7733> Maybe some others but valve is the only i know wont screw you up for cash
<fillyfillyy> TOY_PON3|Drawing you just got a new watcher :D
<flutter_spin> I felt Torchlight was better
<unfoundbug> diablo3 was a joke
<Lasharus> Whaddya mean they can't? They have, and they will.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> thanks fillyfillyy
<unfoundbug> a single player game that required an online connection
<CriticKitten> Face it, a Blizzard title sells approximately 80 billion million copies. :|
<prince-dari> Ok
<Lasharus> 'was' a joke unfoundbug? It's not even OUT yet.
<The_4th_Wall> 'Gunzerker' will dual-weild
<Jim> There's coming a torchlight 2, with ONLINE play
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Blizzard will force always-on into the industry because D3 will sell like hotcakes.
<fillyfillyy> i am kidkiddkiddd
<unfoundbug> yes was a joke
<unfoundbug> now its just sad
<Lasharus> I'll wait for the game itself.
<flutter_spin> And the whole online store? lol, what was it... Korea that forced them to make a version without it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So major publishers will follow because it's profitable.
<SayWhat> DAT plush
<unfoundbug> omg i want that luna
<The_4th_Wall> sniper and a rocket launcher?
<CriticKitten> They can do whatever they want and it will STILL sell, which is why they bastardized Diablo 3 into a half-baked MMO and killed its singleplayer.
<Lasharus> I've always greatly enjoyed the Diablo franchise. I might not like the bollocks around it, but the games themselves are usually solid.
<pony_7733> D3 will be horrible a monthly pay system is just not right anything before D3 was buy and play
<The_4th_Wall> I'll die of laughter
<unfoundbug> and that other one
<Lasharus> ...
<pony_7733> Not play and pay every month
<Lasharus> A monthly pay system?
*fillyfillyy dies cause he doesnt have Pinkie Pie plushie
<Lasharus> What insane site have you been reading?
<pony_7733> Yes Diablo 3 will be that
<Lasharus> No it won't.
*Jim uses phoenix down on fillyfillyy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Call of Duty is turning into an MMO.
<SayWhat> Diablo 3 isn't ptp
<CriticKitten> Oh, did they switch D3 to a pay-to-play model? Really?
<Lasharus> No they didn't.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You already have a subscription service with its MP.
<flutter_spin> ugh, Call of Duty. PR disaster
<fillyfillyy> it is not effective Jim
*Jim uses Pinkie doll on fillyfillyy
<pony_7733> Lasharus give me a source and ill change my statement
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I won't be surprised if the MP goes subscription-based soon.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe in a couple of years.
<TheDr> any pony else going to get the MLPFIM friendship exspress dvd when it comes out?
<Lasharus> Give ME a source to your statement.
<fillyfillyy> it is extremely effective
<Lasharus> Because yours is by far the more unlikely and illogical.
<fillyfillyy> shall i lose this i will die again
<The_4th_Wall> Call of Duty= death of treyarch/infinityward's triple a ratings
<PonyGirl_82> I be back ^.^
<CriticKitten> All I've heard so far is that it includes DRM, has no offline singleplayer, features a shop system identical to major MMOs and numerous other MMO features in its gameplay, and has a new singleplayer mode that can't be solo'd, effectively making it an MMO in all but name.
<fillyfillyy> BRB
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision is pretty much untouchable because of the mass popularity of CoD. Kotick could eat a baby in public and get away with it.
<CriticKitten> I hadn't heard anything about P2P for D3.
<Aircrafter> Modern Marfare 3: Call of Filly.
<otakon1> eeyup CriticKitten
<flutter_spin> Zero Punctuation of Call of Duty = Classic
<TheDr> lol
<Lasharus> That's pretty much accurate CriticKitten.
<otakon1> but I'm still buying ME3 when it comes out
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon1: And support EA?
<Wrek> 05im not
<Lasharus> Though it CAN be solo'd, just probably not the highest difficulty levels.
<otakon1> I'm not doing it for EA
<prince-dari> Hey derpy|With_Guest
<mario_pony> i support nintendo
<Lasharus> In that it's pretty similar to Diablo II, really. :P
<CriticKitten> I saw ME3 and....honestly I don't get the hype
<derpy|With_Guest> Hello
<otakon1> Lasharus: no, he means you can't play the game offline
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate publisher X, but will still buy their game = support for the publisher in the eyes of the publisher.
<fillyfillyy> im back
<The_4th_Wall> i am no longer punctually correct when referring to call of duty
<flutter_spin> oh wait, did anyone else see the Book of Records say that um.. what was it, Black Ops voted best ending?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And publisher X will continue to screw you over.
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - which is why i haven't bought either MW3 or Battlefield 3
<otakon1> CriticKitten: it makes more sense if you play and complete the first two
<Lasharus> But that's still not a monthly pay-to-play system otakon1.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And lobby for SOPA-like shit.
<Aircrafter> I wonder what a amnesia Sequel would be like.
<MirrorImage> and never plan to
<CriticKitten> It looked like an ordinary shooter. Isn't this the franchise that integrated RPG elements into its gameplay? Because they didn't appear at all.
<derpy|With_Guest> Im turning my laptop off soon
<derpy|With_Guest> So ill still be on my phone
<The_4th_Wall> I never will either
<pony_7733> Nvm guess i read the most far out statement then guess diablo 3 wont be a pay to play basis
<Lasharus> Unless you want to argue that you have to pay for the internet itself, making it a monthly pay to play thing.
<otakon1> Lasharus: no, but it's practically a MMO now witht the MUST ALWAYS BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERENET business
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because they have investors-over-consumers syndrome.
<pony_7733> Still i got a feeling they are gonna butcher the series due to lore
<The_4th_Wall> cod & bf are dead to me
<Lasharus> Oh I know.
<Derpy_Hooves> btw johnjoseco will use the nickname JJ
<unfoundbug> any company which supports sopa can aadd another name to the people who pirate their games
<Lasharus> I strongly dislike it myself.
<mario_pony> did anypony know SOPA is soup in spanish?
<MirrorImage> ugh... and speaking of Bethesda games and bugs...
<prince-dari> Ok
<PonyGirl_82> lol
<otakon> damn it
<MirrorImage> it's one thing for me to get a crash error once when i try to fast travel...
<otakon> my stream went dead AGAIN
<otakon> fuck you LimeV
<MirrorImage> but now i've just gotten one 3 times in a row for the same fast travel inFNV
<flutter_spin> hehe. GoDaddy supported SOPA ans lost 200,000 people
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SOPA is couch in Spanish.
<Swiftshot> i think sopa means trash in Swedish too
<SayWhat> ME gusta
<CriticKitten> Eh, even if I had played ME1 and 2, I wouldn't like 3, I think.
<Ingwaz> well Nittany_Discord, i can tell you this, until capcom fixes their errors and starts thinking straight again, i refuse to buy any of their products
<CriticKitten> It looks like a plain vanilla shooter.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I doubt they will.
<unfoundbug> 3 has a nice idea which has been missing, multiple play modes
<mario_pony> Nittany_Discord: no sofa is couch in spanish
<flutter_spin> I love the combat in ME. It sort of a "hey guys, have combat like this"
<Aircrafter> I wonder what'll happen with RE6.
<CriticKitten> The demo provided at E3 was a shooter. A pretty looking one but still just a shooter
<Lasharus> As far as I'm concerned, Diablo III might have a bloody good story, and the gameplay could hold up pretty well - I don't know, I'm not in the beta - so I'll probably get it and enjoy it.
<SayWhat> ME?
<unfoundbug> able to play RPG, shooter or story mode
<pony_7733> Lasharus i somehow just know so much lore will be retconned and what not blizzard simply will and they are known for it
<flutter_spin> Mass Effect
<Lasharus> We'll see.
<mario_pony> Hello PonyGirl_82!!!!!!!
<The_4th_Wall> I can't wait until hollywood sees people pulling thier support and stops funding SOPA
<pony_7733> I wont be buying it either way
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01These companies won't change for the better unless they start posting losses, and even then they still might not change.
<Lasharus> Some retcons may come up, but overall, the storylines are meshed reasonably well together.
<owlicious> what game is this?
<Ulthane> wait... with the req to have internet connection to play single player games, when the company goes bust we will no longer be able to play even single player?
<PonyGirl_82> Hello mario_pony
<otakon> CriticKitten: ofc, they've been making it more shooter like since the first game
<SayWhat> BLizzard is coming out with a new game in 2015, it's called Titan. It was a on a leaked template for releases
<owlicious> no?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01THQ still pitches the used sales lie for example.
<SayWhat> Tey are also making a Warcraft movie
<Lasharus> That's hardly news SayWhat. :P
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: if they dont, then i hope the company goes out of business. I do not say that out of some misguided hate. Just that I would rather see my formerly favorite company end than continue on a sham of its former self
<flutter_spin> I got Diablo 3 beta. You only get to do 1 section. Get to about level 9 by yourself and get 3 abilities.
<pony_7733> Possibly but blizzard simply will destroy much the original fans liked
<tgl1992> Hi everypony, Im back!
<otakon> Ulthane: eeyup, if the servers ever go down you can't play D3 anymore
<otakon> hiya tgl1992
<SayWhat> It is all the news in zeh world!
<pony_7733> They did it with the warcraft lore
<flutter_spin> But then you, well, do it over and over to see the other abilities/classes
<Lasharus> Yeah, they said that about StarCraft II as well pony_7733. I frankly adored it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Right now, I hope the entire industry crashes.
<Ulthane> otakon: that's... wrong
<CriticKitten> Starcraft 2 is still a solid game though.
<Lasharus> So as far as I'm concerned, people can doomspeak all they like. If I enjoy it, that's what matters to me.
<pony_7733> Starcraft II was actually k but yeah not solid
<CriticKitten> It just features some bad business decisions.
<SayWhat> Got it, i got stuck and quit
<otakon> Ulthane: I know it is, try telling that to Blizzard
<tgl1992> %Nittany_Discord: What do you mean?
<CriticKitten> Like "LAN play? Who needs that lol?"
<otakon> and the game STILL isn't out
<PonyGirl_82> I presume Wrek is still streaming
<unfoundbug> Nittany_Discord please dont say that i would actually like a job
<owlicious> koreans?
<otakon> well he was
<SayWhat> Yarn
*mario_pony doesn't know what everypony is talking about!!!
<otakon> but my stream went kaput
<unfoundbug> and a reason for this 4 year masters degree
<TheDr> stand back im a bout to make a pony comic sorta
<otakon> bc LIMEV HATES ME AND ONLY ME!
<fillyfillyy> im with you mario_pony
<pony_7733> We are discussing games mario pony
<flutter_spin> SC2 was awesome. Story was there, good story on its own, but terrible seeing it from SC1 point of view
<PonyGirl_82> it's working for me otakon, you should try refreshing
<unfoundbug> mario, games industry in general
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So you can work for someone that will tell you what to do and profit off of your work?
<The_4th_Wall> Imagine this: online gaming VANISHES off the face of the earth for one month.
<fluttercry> 05,15it had been so long since I played SC1 that I had completely forgotten the story
<CriticKitten> And mind, the game HAS the ability to do LAN play. They use it for their tournaments. Which means they consciously decided NOT to add LAN play to the finished game product.
<SayWhat> WhaaaA?
<mario_pony> like NINTENDO??
<flutter_spin> Yeah, um, that Kickstarter guy :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I'm not talking about your boss.
<otakon> PonyGirl_82: I HAVE been so MUCH refreshing but it's LimeV thats derping on my end
<tgl1992> I loved SC1. Is 2 better?
<KernelCobb> hey there bronies!
<Jim> hi KernelCobb
<flutter_spin> SC2 is better.
<Aircrafter> Hey KernelCobb.
<unfoundbug> The_4th_Wall that would be a great day
<NewDCD> Roger
<otakon> but yh, I'm still buying Mass Effect 3 when it comes out
<tgl1992> Hi KernelCobb
<PonyGirl_82> too bad I had that shit yesterday, ended up having to reinstall my browser in the end
<Aircrafter> Ooo. What now o_o
<The_4th_Wall> after that, the question is... DO YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR GAMING FRIENDS?
<otakon> I haven't put in well over 300 hours of my life NOT to know how this story will end
<unfoundbug> yes, i live with them :P
<KernelCobb> How is everyone doing today?
<flutter_spin> I have no friends.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision is infamous for practically controlling their studios.
<CriticKitten> End? Silly otakon, they'll make another one
<KernelCobb> :)
<otakon> hiya KernelCobb okay
<CriticKitten> Just to make you mad
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA does it to a lesser degree.
<Aircrafter> Just Fine Kernel. Just Fine. How about you?
<otakon> CriticKitten: this is the end of SHEPARDS story
<pony_7733> And giving them a year to do the games they want
<The_4th_Wall> not a factor, unfoundbug
<KernelCobb> I'm doin great
<mario_pony> i don't play online or xbox live or psn
<KernelCobb> thx for askin aircrafter
<fillyfillyy> who is gonna stream?
<CriticKitten> Yes, and Halo Reach was the last Halo game.
<otakon> I couldn't give a rats ass about the next game
<unfoundbug> hence why all the companies im in the middle of applying to do not deal with activision
<Aircrafter> No problem....I'm the boss.
<PonyGirl_82> gotta brb, feet need defrosting again >_<
<flutter_spin> The universe will still be there. Probably a spinoff
<tgl1992> I want some Futurama :D
<CriticKitten> Oh, wait, whoops. No it wasn't. :D
<otakon> CriticKitten: the end tot he story of the GUY i've been playing as
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Go indie.
<pony_7733> Yearly releases are just quality destroyers
<otakon> not some FUCKING prequel
<otakon> or some FUCKING side story
<flutter_spin> My brothers game is Castle Crashers. That's a good indie game there.
<CriticKitten> Like I said.
<diddutz> yay LIMBO ftw!
<CriticKitten> They say NOW that it's the last one of this story.
<KernelCobb> i have an idea...he should stream the stream
<Aircrafter> Well this conversation has definetly went wacky.
<otakon> or some FUCKING NO NAME FUCKING GRUNT THAT CAN'T EVEN FUCKING DUAL WEILD PISTOLS!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That was pretty popular.
<fluttercry> 05,15Do you think our children will ever see Half Life 3?
<CriticKitten> But I wouldn't count on it.
<Jim> maybe our grand children
<Lasharus> This conversation's turned rather caustic.
<The_4th_Wall> life without online gaming will give birth to the only sitcom available on any channel
<KernelCobb> fluttercry eenope
<owlicious> no, we'd just see infinite loading bars
<unfoundbug> fluttercry they probably wont ever actually release it
<The_4th_Wall> FOR LIFE
<mario_pony> soo PonyGirl_82 did you find anything to eat?
<otakon> flutter_spin: their children's children's MAYBE
<CriticKitten> fluttercry: Gabe Newell can't count to three, so no
<tgl1992> W00t some PF!
<otakon> what am I looking at?
<PonyGirl_82> I had tinned peach slices mario_pony
<unfoundbug> it will never reach its hype
<fillyfillyy> KernelCobb there is no eenope its nnope
<KernelCobb> dude, this guy rocks!
<otakon> oh this
<KernelCobb> fillyfillyy yes, yes of course
<KernelCobb> silly me
<The_4th_Wall> what's Pink Floyd?
<owlicious> a band of some sort?
<Wrek> 05a few ppl messaged me beign sad they missed this
<PonyGirl_82> oh the concert cool
<pony_7733> On a serious note EP3 or HL3 will come out atleast in 10 years
<KernelCobb> you are about to find out
<flutter_spin> Pink Floyd is music with wacky taste
<fillyfillyy> i take my Big Mac quotes seriously
<fluttercry> 05,15....I don't want to live on this planet anymore
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe when the economy improves, we'll see some positive change.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't count on it.
<KernelCobb> fillyfillyy then i bet you loved the newest episode
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because if something is profitable, why stop.
<PonyGirl_82> Better hope Amras isn't here otherwise we'll have neverending bitching
<unfoundbug> Nittany_Discord unlikely, there pushing too much into mobile and onlive gaming
<fluttercry> 05,15How can people NOT know what Pink Floyd is?
<fillyfillyy> eeyup
<otakon> fluttercry: you said that in Farnsworth voice
<CriticKitten> Nittany: Stick to indie games.
<KernelCobb> lol
<flutter_spin> Pink Floyd is odd. You can't help but love it, but you may still hate it.
<otakon> fluttercry: ignorance, it's easy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01e.g. CoD Elite, CoD itself, Online Pasess.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*passes
<mario_pony> you know whats funny corn and p+orn sound soo much alike!
<ScootaChicken> mfw I come back and Pink Floyd
<CriticKitten> And ArenaNet. They're cool.
<ScootaChicken> Wrek
<ScootaChicken> I love you.
<Ulthane> Nittany_Discord IF the economy improves:P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sequelitis
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Definite IF.
<Wrek> 05but yeah
<tgl1992> ArenaNet had its up and downs with Guild Wars
<The_4th_Wall> AJ level of honesty here: I've never heard Pink Floyd
<CriticKitten> But EA, Activision/Blizzard, etc can go burn. :p
<flutter_spin> Dark Side of the Moon *cough*
<Wrek> 05i promised shine on
<Wrek> 05so here it is
<ScootaChicken> Wrek: is this Shine on You Crazy Diamond?
<fluttercry> 05,15Sequelitis I love that series
<pony_7733> COD will always keep being made
<unfoundbug> Nittany_Discord unlikely, current generation of gamers are.. not the greatest players
<ScootaChicken> yep.
<Aircrafter> Are we on a acid trip or what?
<pony_7733> Every year
<Aircrafter> @_@ Cause I'm seeing things....
<flutter_spin> its Pink Floyd. Go with it.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Current generation of gamers are kids or sheep.
<PonyGirl_82> we are, it is groovy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Most of them.
<tgl1992> Agree
<KernelCobb> Pinkie Floyd...it must be done
<The_4th_Wall> leastways not being consciious it was Pink Floyd
<fluttercry> 05,15So many kids
<Aircrafter> Its like..Watching the earth being born...
<ScootaChicken> Nittany_Discord: I'm technically a kid.
<CriticKitten> Aircrafter: O u. You clearly weren't around to watch Yellow Submarine with us. <3
<pony_7733> They cant tell quality from bile of trash
<CriticKitten> THAT is an acid trip.
<mario_pony> Nittany_Discord: i am a kid but i take gaming very seriously.
<unfoundbug> hence why i tend to only play on PC now
<PonyGirl_82> makes me wanna go listen to some Tangerine Dream. Love that psychadelic shit
<tgl1992> You would not believe what I see on the Bethesda forums. Everyone wants the old TES games made into Skyrim's graphics :[
<unfoundbug> custom servers = kicked kids = decent game enviroment
<Aircrafter> @_@ Its like watching the sun slowly expand and engulf the earth....but slowly....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Forgive me for saying kids then.
<ScootaChicken> I'm rather sad that I wasn't around when we watched Yellow Submarine
<The_4th_Wall> I'm 22, fluttercry, thank you very much
<Aircrafter> Its...Its amazing...
<flutter_spin> Mom has the console, setup in the living room. I can't touch it without her watching me play
<ScootaChicken> That would have been.... beautiful...
<fluttercry> 05,15to be honest though tgl1992 that would be kind of cool
<flutter_spin> PC... all mine
<Jim> Well, I've got to go, cya tomorrow
<fluttercry> 05,15leave the gameplay intact though
<MasterBrony> imma go watch the new ep again
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But we still have the problem of gamers not knowing when to say no to games.
<KernelCobb> The_4th_wall if you really were, you wouldn't sa that
<PonyGirl_82> later Jim
<tgl1992> Leave the classics be, I say...except Mario :D
<ScootaChicken> bye Jim
<[SWAG]thehated5689> bai Jim
<owlicious> mario 3d was kindof messed up
<fluttercry> 05,15I don't know, the REmake of resident evil was DAMN good
<Morty> bai jim
<owlicious> they have a super mushroom if you fail hard
<KernelCobb> Jim is leaving? D:
<mario_pony> yeah i hated mario3d
<tgl1992> Never played Resident Evil
<unfoundbug> Nittany_Discord also not making their own decision on what a good game is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like Ubisoft PC games or CoD map packs (remember when people complained about the price but bought it anyway?).
<ScootaChicken> fluttercry, the one on the Gamecube?
<unfoundbug> just going for whichever has the largest advertising budget
<Jim> Yeah, I've got some work to do, and I'm getting too distracted by the chat ^^
<Aircrafter> I'd like the original resident evils too be remade in better graphics, but still corner shots.
<fluttercry> 05,15yeah, I loved that one
<ScootaChicken> that one updated the voice acting...
<CriticKitten> Well to be fair Nittany, there are still plenty of truly good titles being made.
<flutter_spin> Nintendo -> Genesis -> PS. That was my order.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Quality is subjective.
<The_4th_Wall> Flutterspin, Play ALL the games! Break ALL the ruls!
<fluttercry> 05,15but I missed the terrible voice acting
<Aircrafter> Or atleast give the players the choice of corner shots or over the hsoulder.
<CriticKitten> And made by major developers too.
<Aircrafter> shoulder*
<ScootaChicken> it meant the voice acting was no longer so painful it was wonderful, but so okay it was average
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I won't buy from major publishers.
<CriticKitten> I can look down the list of PC exclusives and name several, actually.
<unfoundbug> yes, but anyone who thinks mw3 is a good game does not deserve the title of gamer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't care if they make a great game.
<fluttercry> 05,15Stop! Don't open THAT door!
<KernelCobb> i'm surprised nintendo hasn't released a mini game remake of Donkey Kong...with the ladders and barrels and such
<mario_pony> i love super mario bros 3
<CriticKitten> Just for this coming year of 2012 alone.
<unfoundbug> its just a mappack for 2 without your old save
<flutter_spin> Yet I still look back at old games. Anyone remember Starcontrol 2? I wonder..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just refuse to support their business practices.
<Aircrafter> Woah. That was close. You almost got turned into A JILL SANDWICH.
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh my Cod! It's Forrest, and it looks like he was killed by a crow!
<CriticKitten> Nittany: Then you refuse to encourage the GOOD publishers?
<CriticKitten> Which do still exist.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll buy from them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm talking AAA ones.
<mario_pony> Nittany_Discord: what do you think about nintendo?
<The_4th_Wall> dat sound= legit
<KernelCobb> nintendo tries too hard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno. They supported SOPA.
<unfoundbug> what about games like skyrim?
<The_4th_Wall> not my genre, but respectable
<unfoundbug> old stlye open world
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I own Skyrim.
<KernelCobb> skyrim was a great game. I consider it a milestone
<unfoundbug> hard reset?
<flutter_spin> I can relate. They pour big cash into products that don't look great in the end. Movie - Transformers
<KernelCobb> in the gaming community
<unfoundbug> game of the year in my books massivly under rated though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Haven't bought Hard Reset, but did play the demo.
<The_4th_Wall> Microsoft AND Sony supported SOPA
<ScootaChicken> Skyrim achieved the milestone that Oblivion failed to
<Wrek> 05SHINE
<Wrek> 05ON
<KernelCobb> game of the year in Game Informer as well unfoundbug
<Wrek> 05YOU CRAAAAZY
<Wrek> 05DIAMOND
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Microsoft opposed SOPA I think.
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: what about games like mass effect 3? to my knowledge, bioware isnt on the most hated list
<ScootaChicken> you shone like the suN!
<CriticKitten> Haha, I watched the Transformers movies. I really pissed my friend off when I correctly predicted the ending of the third movie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And PIPA.
<Aircrafter> I want a open world game like Minecraft but better. You start with a simple gun and a home. Your objective: Find people, survive, and thrive.
<The_4th_Wall> HA HARD RESET
<KernelCobb> shine on you CRAAAAAZY Tom
<Malefor> Anyone there? Man, I haven't been here in years...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They are under EA.
<PonyGirl_82> lol
<Starfire_Blaze> Minecraft is coming to le xbox.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So they are banned.
<ScootaChicken> like black holes in the sky!
<flutter_spin> My brother was an old fan of Tranformers. HATED them.
<KernelCobb> xbox minecraft won't be the same as pc minecraft
<KernelCobb> i'm not going to get it
<Kimori> hi
<Ingwaz> wait...minecraft is coming to xbox? since when?
<The_4th_Wall> ....RANDOM WINDOW
<fluttercry> 05,15I remember when Neverwinter Nights was released. I fraking loved that game
<ScootaChicken> and shiiiiiine!
<flutter_spin> I... still haven't played Minecraft
<CriticKitten> We were watching the movie and Optimus was getting whooped by some guy. So I leaned over and told my friend "I will bet you that Optimus defeats that guy later in the movie, all by himself." My friend was like "NOWAI".
<Aircrafter> I hope they give a discount too people that have the pc version.
<CriticKitten> Guess how the movie ended. :3
<KernelCobb> ingwaz announced at last year e3
<Lasharus> I preferred its predecessor fluttercry.
<Kimori> Its been real empty here for the past month, dont think anyone knows this channel is still here
<Lasharus> Baldur's Gate II.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01From gamer opinion, it seems that Bioware fell in quality under EA.
<The_4th_Wall> I hvent mined yet
<fluttercry> 05,15I had that too.
<Starfire_Blaze> Off to watch Walking Dead, toodles everypony.
<Lasharus> I certainly feel that way Nittany_Discord.
<Aircrafter> See ya Starfire_Blaze.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which I honestly predicted would happen.
<Ingwaz> oh well, i dont play minecraft personally, i'm not really in tot he sandbox games
<Lasharus> Dragon Age annoyed me a great deal.
<KernelCobb> buhbye starfire_blaze
<flutter_spin> ^^ Baldur's Gate. Good game, didn't care for it at the time.
<Lasharus> Not because the game was THAT bad.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I felt it.
<otakon> eh
<Lasharus> But because of the business policy around it.
<otakon> well ofc, damn moneygrubbers
<pony_7733> But still ME3 will most likely be the last great game they made
<fluttercry> 05,15Dragon Age was alright, Dragon Age 2 should be sent to the moon
<fillyfillyy> ill be back in like 30 minutes ok im gonna go get some Scootachicken :D nom nom nom
<Malefor> I know it is... this place went dead a really, really long time ago. I wanted to see what was going on for the fun of it. :P If anyone still remembers me... I know Icy does...
<PonyGirl_82> skipping T^T
<flutter_spin> lol fluttercry. Agreed
<pony_7733> make*
<Lasharus> EVERY TIME I set up camp, there's that shithead at the edge of the place.
<KernelCobb> off to dinner, everypony, i'll be back later
<ScootaChicken> dear god fillyfillyy
<Aircrafter> You do that FillyFillyy.
<otakon> GIVE US A SEQUEL IN A YEAR! LIKE OUR MADDEN FRANCHISE!
<The_4th_Wall> NOMNOMNOMPIE
<otakon> see ya KernelCobb
<PonyGirl_82> Wrek its skipping :C
<Midnight_Tempest> awww yeah... come back to Pink Floyd
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm sure EA forced multiplayer into ME3.
<Lasharus> "PLEASE save the keep of my forefathers!" "Okay" "Oh thank you hero! Just go to the shop and buy this DLC!" "FUCK OFF"
<fluttercry> 05,15Bioware said MP was always in the works
<fillyfillyy> aircrafter my name isnt capitalized
<otakon> also, HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY FUCKING A NEW MADDEN GAME EVERY FUCKING YEAR!
<moop> hi
<otakon> HOW?
<CriticKitten> Well, if you want an example of how BIoware has slipped, Nittany....you need look no further than The Old Republic.
<Aircrafter> Lol. I know wht you mean Lasharus.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<otakon> hiy moop
<flutter_spin> They still doing that? I thought... well last I heard they were still debating
<fillyfillyy> haha so i didnt cap yours!
<unfoundbug> otakon, same way they do with fifa
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: i've seen footage of the multiplayer, it looks pretty good actually, and as fluttercry said, they were wanting to do it from the beginning
<otakon> CriticKitten: what? I heard that was enjoyable
<unfoundbug> people buy it
<unfoundbug> they sell it
<Wrek> 05hows quality?
<moop> i just burnt my tonge with a hot cookie
<Aircrafter> I have origins, and I was like SO MUCH STUFF 8D and then dlcs....FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<MirrorImage> otakon - because back when the series started, a new game meant updated rosters
<fluttercry> 05,15great quality Wrek
<PonyGirl_82> really bad on my end Wrek
<otakon> Wrek: good, but a little stammering
<CriticKitten> otakon: It's good, but that's precisely the problem.
<PonyGirl_82> it's skipping and pausing tons
<MirrorImage> and we got suckered into the business model, and no one has screamed loud enough to change it
<The_4th_Wall> a new game in a series once everytwo years is STILL fast
<otakon> yah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stream is fine for me.
<Midnight_Tempest> Wrek: you got such awesome taste in music
<otakon> nowadays
<Aircrafter> I swear too god this is a acid trip.
<The_4th_Wall> dat brass
<Lasharus> Okay, enough ranting about games. I'm in a bad mood, and this isn't helping.
<otakon> you could just DOWNLOAD roster updates
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Malefor> 4I remember prince-dari, guy, Icy, and Aicebo. ( I forget how to spell it... >.<)
<Wrek> 05hah aircrafter
<CriticKitten> TOR is meant to be the successor to KOTOR, an excellent game. In that role, it falls flat on its face at the very first hurdle of the race.
<MirrorImage> otakon - not for Madden 98 you couldn't
<otakon> but
<Wrek> 05wait untill they play sorrow
<flutter_spin> Yeah my brother is in a group of 8 people. It takes them a good 3-4 years.
<Wrek> 05NOW THAT is a trip
<MirrorImage> or 99, or 2000, or 2001 i believe
<fluttercry> 05,15so how bout this Pink Floyd?
<prince-dari> Hey.
<ScootaChicken> Wrek: are you streaming the whole thing or just Shine On?
<NightSeas> 12ohai
<Aircrafter> I very much enjoyed kotor
<Malefor> 4There were a few others... but I forget them...
<Aircrafter> One was perfect
<otakon> but I'm just getting started
<Malefor> 4Heh...
<PonyGirl_82> I can't watch it if it's going to keep skipping :C
<Wrek> 05well
<Wrek> 05planned on the whole thing
<prince-dari> Aicebo, yeah, you spelt it right.
<Aircrafter> 2 was ok, I wish they made a third. They were planning it but they didnt.
<Malefor> 4Do you remember me, Dari? ^^
<otakon> Aircrafter: agreed, it was perfect, GREAT game
<CriticKitten> It boils down to being a refined WoW clone. A good game, but still very similar to WoW, and not at all the spiritual successor to KOTOR.
<Wrek> 05cause it was requested by a few that missed it
<Kimori> NightSeas is Cynder
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, I do Malefor.
<unfoundbug> anyone playing anything interesting atm?
<prince-dari> Xd
<otakon> and now I'm getting MUCH lag
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll end that, in my opinion, the mainstream industry is too corrupted for my tastes. The only fix is either mass gamer boycotts (that stick) or a collapse.
<prince-dari> XD*
<PonyGirl_82> it's unlistenable for me
<The_4th_Wall> Battlegrounds 2 was the best
<NightSeas> 12herpderp
<Malefor> 4Awesome. I've changed over the past few years...
<Aircrafter> I swear too god 1 Had me addicted from day 1 too 30
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: it'll be collapse first
<Kimori> If your not around here these days Malefor, where do you hang out?
<The_4th_Wall> ^
<MasterBrony> http://derpy.me/pKhjR
<flutter_spin> Eh, I think it reflects how the economy is tanking too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A collapse will recycle the industry.
<prince-dari> As you can see, site's pretty dead now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And break the oligopoly.
<Midnight_Tempest> im still planning on getting ME3, even if its not on steam... i just hope they let me copy my steam saves if not i will be PISSED
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: i agree that theres a lot wrong with the gaming industry, but some games are legitimately good
<otakon> Aircrafter: I bought a friggin Xbox to play KotoR
<The_4th_Wall> and the corruption
<Aircrafter> Lol. thats good Masterbrony.
<Malefor> 4Yep... I haven't been on here in years. I'm over at DarkSpyro now... been there for a while...
<flutter_spin> *ashamed* I never played KOTOR
<prince-dari> I still see Stormy, Aicebo, Lambda, and Neon every so often.
<Kimori> do they have an irc channel?
<prince-dari> C7 still turns up here too.
<otakon> flutter_spin: go get it for PC NOW
<Aircrafter> Otakon: I spent my xbox days ( I started out gaming on a xbox ) Playing the first fable, Halo, And Kotor 1 and 2.
<otakon> here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just gotta wait until people get bored of CoD and sick of EA and Ubisoft's bullshit.
<Midnight_Tempest> i could never really get into KOTOR... and i love bioware games
<otakon> I have a link
<otakon> hold on
<flutter_spin> lol. Everyone says to play it, but I just don't want to.
<Ingwaz> KOTOR is one of the great star wars rpgs
*The_4th_Wall downloads poster and heads to kinko's
<CriticKitten> A game that was as well done as KOTOR was should not be succeeded by a title like TOR. What amuses me most is that the game advertises itself using the Square Enix advertisement methodology: Show lots of flashy cutscenes and CGI that tells you NOTHING about the game and demonstrates zero gameplay whatsoever.
<ScootaChicken> time for Astronomy Domine!
<diddutz> I'm afraid that wont happen Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And maybe Sony, but they are starting to flounder. The end.
<prince-dari> I think RDX pretty much ran away because he was scared by all the pony lovers. :P
<Aircrafter> It is a legend that will always live in my heart as one of my favorites.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You never know.
<Malefor> 4I remember Stormy and Neon... don't remember the others... :P I definitely remember Razz. We have the same birthday...
<prince-dari> Oh God, Razz.
<mario_pony> wow Nittany_Discord you are soooo SMART!!!!
<flutter_spin> I was doing good just going back and playing FFIV, FFV, FFVI
<Malefor> 4Yep...
<Ingwaz> CriticKitten: agreed, thats part of what i like about bioshock infinity, the trailer they released not long ago was made from entirely in game footage
<The_4th_Wall> PINK
<The_4th_Wall> PINK EVERYWHERE
<Wrek> 05i love this concert
<CriticKitten> And for bonus points, Bioware decided that TOR was worth an equal amount to WoW, because they are identically priced.
<ScootaChicken> oh no, this is Learning to Fly...
<The_4th_Wall> YELLOW
<Aircrafter> Hey Wrek, How long is this video?
<NightSeas> 12Was Razz a noob? I wasn't here that long ago XD
<CriticKitten> That's hubris if ever I saw it.
<ScootaChicken> huh, guess I'm remembering wrong
<Wrek> 05this is a 3 hour acid trip
<The_4th_Wall> YELLOW EVERYWHERE
<PonyGirl_82> I think my modem hates this concert T^T It's skipping so much I cannot hear a bit of the song
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Wrek: I know this is awesome
<Midnight_Tempest> best concert ever, period
<Aircrafter> ...and how far in are we >_>
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I might still be wrong mario_pony.
<Wrek> 0515 minutes
<owlicious> we need to go deeper
<Aircrafter> OH GOD
<diddutz> xD
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<Aircrafter> ....i need something too drink
<The_4th_Wall> Best part?
<prince-dari> Razz was someone who drew Spyro art, she was pretty good, but she had a lot of 'followers' that pretty much idolised her on the forums.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Honestly, my opinion is one-sided.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Aircrafter: Y U no like concert?! :|
<Aircrafter> Be right back my fellow Ponies
<Aircrafter> I dont not like it
<CriticKitten> At least Rift had the dignity to price itself lower than WoW.
<Aircrafter> I mean
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And you can thank Ubisoft and Sony for that.
<Aircrafter> I LOVE IT
<prince-dari> And she took offense if you didn't LOVE her art.
<The_4th_Wall> I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS SHIT
<CriticKitten> TOR? nope.avi
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Okay..
<PonyGirl_82> I'll be back later I can't listen to this whilst my modem is fucking up
<flutter_spin> The problem I have is that their songs are long. I don't like anything over 5 minutes.
<NightSeas> 12ah
<Aircrafter> Kicked.... =_= But I love it, its just long.
<The_4th_Wall> LIKE A BOSS
<Malefor> 4I'm still friends with Razz. :P
<otakon> flutter_spin: mfw ALL the sites I used to dl good old games no longer have Star Wars KotoR in their libraries
<Wrek> 05I also have a few aerosmith and metallica concerts lyign around, if there's any interest anotehr night
<Aircrafter> Very...Very Long.
<Midnight_Tempest> im not going to play TOR... not until it becomes F2P, like it probably will
<PonyGirl_82> yes to both for me Wrek
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sony shouldn't have the right to fucking take features from my console and limit it's activations under firmware updates.
<ScootaChicken> Wrek: that would be awesome
<prince-dari> Hah, is she any different? :P
*The_4th_Wall considers starting acid for tis
*TOY_PON3|Drawing doesn't like it when ponies don't have good taste in music
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> :|
<flutter_spin> Oh, don't worry about me. I, uh, have KOTOR. Just haven't played it
<Ulthane> Wrek yes and yes
<Aircrafter> I swear too god THEY HAVE TOO MAKE KOTOR 3. JUST MAKE IT GOOD.
<mario_pony> what starts with p and ends in orn?
<Shizuka> 13should play metallica and symphony some time
<Wrek> 05also I hope you can forgive me headphone users
<ScootaChicken> Wrek: which concerts are the Metallica and Aerosmith ones, out of curiosity?
<mario_pony> popcorn!!!
<otakon> Shizuka!
<Wrek> 05but the ending of this concert needs maximum volume
*otakon hugs Shizuka
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Shizuka: please do
<Aircrafter> I'm thinking of getting one again, its 8 bucks at gamestop. and Its been a while since I played.
<Malefor> 4Not really. :T I guess... she takes offense sometimes... still fan-crazy over Elora... :P
<Midnight_Tempest> Aircrafter: KOTOR 3 is TOR... unfortunately
<moop> Wrek: NO PLEASE!
<Wrek> 05dont know straight fro my head
<ScootaChicken> Shizuka: I want you to know just how much I appreciate you telling me about S&M
<prince-dari> Oh God. XD
<Wrek> 05ill look it up
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Wrek do it
<ScootaChicken> I love that album so much
<Malefor> 4Yep...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't tell me you're going to hold up the stream for this entire thing. I love Pink Floyd, but I had plans for tonight.
<Aircrafter> No. Tor is not kotor. Its a embaressment. I will never relate it too kotor.
<prince-dari> How old are you now anyway?
<otakon> it's on FRIGGIN STEAM
<flutter_spin> lol air
<moop> my ears are already dying
*TOY_PON3|Drawing adores Pink Floyd
<mario_pony> i have headphones but still DO IT Wrek!!!!
<CriticKitten> Aircrafter: Sorry, it's not going to happen. TOR is the spiritual successor to KOTOR according to Bioware. Nevermind that the two games aren't really the same. Doesn't matter. Bioware won't make another KOTOR.
<otakon> flutter_spin: http://store.steampowered.com/app/32370
<CriticKitten> Because they think TOR *is* KOTOR.
<unfoundbug> streams are like taxis, you wait hours for one, and 3 arrive at once
<flutter_spin> Playing ToR beta, I liked it. Then again, I never played KOTOR. Its.. odd
<Brettmister> x3
<otakon> there is where you can get KotoR
<Malefor> 4Almost thirteen... 7th grade...
<moop> i love this but my ears will explode
<Brettmister> Whut we wtachin >.>
<Wrek> 05too bad this isnt livestream, that way i could max my own volume without disturbign the stream xD
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> true
<The_4th_Wall> Can't spell pornography without a phony
<prince-dari> Hah, been a while...
<otakon> flutter_spin: it was originally based off of the d20 ruleset modified for Star Wars
<Malefor> 4Yeah...
<otakon> that's why it feels weird
<Wrek> 05I AM THE STUD IN STUPID
<Malefor> 4I now have a girlfriend. :P My first...
<otakon> I am the TWIT in Twitter
<NightSeas> 12IRL?
<Brettmister> I put the I in team
<Brettmister> Wait...
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14I am ready.
<flutter_spin> KOTOR is on my list of games I've pasted that I may get back when games stop coming out. Bioshock is on that list too.
<Malefor> 4Nope. :T
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> You cant spell R34 without kick
<NightSeas> 12ah
<Malefor> 4I hope eventually...
<otakon> not really, I don't use Twitter, fuck that noise if you excuse my language
<flutter_spin> Fallout 3 as well
<Wrek> 05<3
<Midnight_Tempest> what i really want... is another Armored Core game
<NightSeas> 12same thing if you ask me
<flutter_spin> Just so many games I've put on that list.
<CriticKitten> As for me, I was originally looking forward to a lot of games. Currently that list has been culled down to one. GW2.
<otakon> flutter_spin: Fallout 1 and 2
<NightSeas> 12derp
<The_4th_Wall> I am the chef in FACEBOOK
<Aircrafter> XD I would get it on pc But I aint much of a pc gamer....
<Malefor> 4People keep saying we're a good couple... :P
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Ugh I hate Facebook and Twitter...
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> -.-
<otakon> I am the terror, that FLAPS in the NIGHT!
<Aircrafter> Fallout 3 was good, I think it was a ok sequel too the first 2.
<diddutz> I hat Facebook, too
<otakon> I am the goo on the bottom of the shoe of evil
<otakon> I AM
<Aircrafter> Fallout new vegas, I dont like because it doesnt have much of a apocalyptic feeling.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Fallout 3 was the best imo
<flutter_spin> I've completed so many games, I guess I am burned out. I will play TOR with my bro in a couple months
<otakon> not Darkwing Duck
<Wrek> 05oh-tay.KHAN
<prince-dari> I've never really been one for the whole online thing, not being able to be with them IRL kind of kills it for me, but if you're happy, that's cool.
<otakon> yes Wrek?
<Midnight_Tempest> Aircrafter: Fallout New Vegas is the real sequal to Fallout 2...
<Wrek> 05finished your sentence for you
<otakon> oh
<otakon> lol
<CriticKitten> I was going to play TOR until they declared a Pay-To-Play model
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> lol
<CriticKitten> Then I stopped caring
<mario_pony> i used to say facebook and twitter were for losers but yet i spend most of my time on bronystate
<The_4th_Wall> I am the bait in taliban
<TheDr> http://james0the0mad.deviantart.com/#/d4pizys i just made this tell me if you like it :):)
<prince-dari> Ah, good.
<Malefor> 4Yeah... we met over at a fan site for a different series...
<Aircrafter> Midnight_Tempest: Ya But it doesnt feel very fallout. But its explained why later in the story ( Spoliers Censored )
<Wrek> 05i have been enjoying rift latley
<otakon> CriticKitten: give it time, it'll become F2P
<flutter_spin> STO turned free. Space combat is fun, but that's it.
<Luna> i'm here.
<prince-dari> Game series?
<otakon> wats STO?
<Wrek> 05star trek online
<flutter_spin> Star Trek Online
<unfoundbug> lol, never noticed that dr
<otakon> oh
<Wrek> 05ninjad
<Aircrafter> XD Thedr, YOU ARE A BOSS.
<CriticKitten> otakon: By then, Guild Wars 2 will be out, and I'll have dedicated my existence to it.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> lol
<otakon> CriticKitten: nice
<Midnight_Tempest> Aircrafter: its true it doesnt feel very apocalyptic, but when you play the DLC stuff... then it gets very Fallout-y
<otakon> damn it
<unfoundbug> STO is pretty entertaining if you got someone to play with
<flutter_spin> I am looking forward to GW2
<otakon> only 23 more days!~
<unfoundbug> shouting "ima firin mah lazer" never gets old
<flutter_spin> But I was also looking forward to Warhammer. That was sad.
<otakon> didn't it wreck?
<Aircrafter> Midnight_Tempest: Ya, the lonely road one felt very much like fallout, dead money was close, and old world blues was just SQUEE
*TOY_PON3|Drawing is possibly the only one looking foward to Twisted Metal this Tuesday
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> ._.
<Malefor> 4Nope... TV show...
<Wrek> 05raise your hoof if you sidlike DLC that makes your game easier
<otakon> Aircrafter: agreed
<The_4th_Wall> I am the 'fense' guarding defense
*Wrek raises hoof
<Brettmister> Hated Twiste Metal..
<prince-dari> Hahaha, I remember this entry in the quote bot: * malefor spots sheep and charges them! * malefor has quit IRC (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client) <DwaggyFireOKN> Looks like the sheep won.
<prince-dari> :P
<Brettmister> Vigilante 8 <3
<NightSeas> 12which one?
<fluttercry> 05,15Why is everyone excited about Guild Wars 2 . What does everyone know that I don't?
<otakon> um no
<unfoundbug> its a sequel
<Midnight_Tempest> Aircrafter: yeah those were great, but Lonesome Road... that was the real fallout feel for me, it was great
<otakon> fluttercry: I have no idea
<unfoundbug> to guild wars
<CriticKitten> At this point, GW2 will have to be a game completely unlike its demos to convince me that it's not worth pouring hours into.
<mario_pony> it's funny i used to say twitter and facebook were for losers with no life yet i spend all my time on bronystate
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> ....
<flutter_spin> I've been watching the vids of GW2. The combat looks sweet
<otakon> damn it, the WAIT for ME3 is literally killing me
<Aircrafter> I like how they even created a semi-back story for the F:NV Main Character, and how about the guy who carried the old world on his back. That really pulled me in the first time.
<CriticKitten> fluttercry: It's an MMO that throws out some of the traditional formulas, so naturally people are hyped.
*The_4th_Wall is the reason you can't see in the room
<Malefor> 4You probably don't know it. You probably would make fun of me if I told you... Well... I mean... I AM a fan of Spyro... :P
<ekips> sorry for interrupting your discussion but I have to ask what is on stream?
<otakon> I CAN'T WAIT NEARLY TWO WEEKS!
<flutter_spin> And that video of everyone vs the black dragon :D
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: IKR?
<otakon> ekips: Pink Floyd
<fluttercry> 05,15I shall look this game up
<prince-dari> Dude, I watch MLP, I'm unlikely to make fun of whatever you watch. :P
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: the demo comes out on tuesday!
<Wrek> 05currently on stream: Pink Floyd, PULSE: Live at Earls Court 1994
<otakon> it DOES
<otakon> SWEET!
<CriticKitten> fluttercry: Lemme save you the time, look here: http://www.guildwars2.com/en/
<flutter_spin> I just want to see the combos like if a mage casts fire shield, your hunter arrows turn into fire hunter arrows
<ekips> thanks!
<NightSeas> 12Your talking about someone who likes MLP
<NightSeas> 12:'D
<otakon> I can't WAIT
<Midnight_Tempest> and guild wars is boring... like most MMO's
<Malefor> 4Heh... It's a Nickelodeon show...
<CriticKitten> They have a lot of the details about the game on that page, or linked from it.
<Wrek> 05but in GW2 you can JUMP
<flutter_spin> Guild Wars was good, but it was SHORT. Very short.
<Wrek> 05JUMP!!!
<Malefor> 4I watch MLP occassionally...
<CriticKitten> Wrek: Inorite
<CriticKitten> XD
<moop> teddy bear!
<unfoundbug> they added jumping
<unfoundbug> OMG
<Midnight_Tempest> i can jump in real life too Wrek, doesnt make everything better...
<Aircrafter> Fallout 3 DLCS were good. I was actually afraid too do the pitt after the first time, I actually just went as far as the bridge and gave up.
<unfoundbug> next they will have running
<CriticKitten> Actually, I couldn't care less about jumping.
<The_4th_Wall> DAT BEAR
<flutter_spin> I played World of Warcraft. A guy decided to continue playing because THE SUN MOVES!
<Wrek> 05he's epic on the steel guitar
<NightSeas> 12Spongebob? I love that show XD
<CriticKitten> I'm psyched for GW2 because it's a genuinely good looking game, that's really all there is to it.
<Kimori> what is it about MLP anyway? Isnt it some childish cartoon?
<fluttercry> 05,15I liked all the Fallout 3 DLC's except the Pitt and Mothership Zeta
<Malefor> 4Nope. :P But we do love that show...
<prince-dari> MLP is My Little Pony
<Malefor> 4I'm talking about PoM...
<flutter_spin> ugh. Mothership Zeta
<CriticKitten> Much like how Skyrim looked good before it came out, and then it came out and surprise, it was actually good.
<Midnight_Tempest> WoW is a waste of time and people that play it religiously should never be allowed to breed... im sorry if that is hateful but i LOATH WoW...
<prince-dari> I don't know that abbreviation
<flutter_spin> My cousin couldn't stop talking about it
<Aircrafter> I liked the weapons, the story of it I didnt very much enjoy though.
<Princess_Luna> What is on right now?
<otakon> Aircrafter: the only thing I didn't like about FO 3 was the eventual "YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING PERFECT" when you hit max level with the right build...
<otakon> oh wait, thats a GOOD thing
<Wrek> 05currently on stream: Pink Floyd, PULSE: Live at Earls Court 1994
<Malefor> 4Penguins of Madagascar... Heh... :T
<prince-dari> Oh
<Aircrafter> Otakon: Lol.
<NightSeas> 12That show isn't childish p:
<Princess_Luna> OK.
<Malefor> 4Yeah... I know it isn't...
<prince-dari> I'm pretty sure I've seen an episode of it before.
<Malefor> 4Some people find it stupid, though...
<mario_pony> so anypony have some weird disorder?
<Malefor> 4I watch it all the time.
<Aircrafter> Ya. In the fallout games eventually you get too overpowering with killing everything in one shot.
<The_4th_Wall> autism
<flutter_spin> WoW was fine in the day. With anything I play, once you complete the content... move on
<Aircrafter> I laughed in the face of Super Mutant Behemoths.
<The_4th_Wall> bipolar
<CriticKitten> I am just looking forward to being able to play it. It's shiny, and being a kitty, shiny things are best things. :P
<The_4th_Wall> ADD
<mario_pony> i can't stand dirtiness i start getting all itchie
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: Fallout 3 had such a small level cap though... i only had 3 skills at 100 when i finished the game...
<Aircrafter> I have a cronic fear of Spiders.
<The_4th_Wall> ditto
<Midnight_Tempest> ^ same
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: I did a high intelligence build and managed to max all skills but speech by 20
<NightSeas> 12You have nothing to worry about as long as it's not on PBS
<Aircrafter> Snakes are ok, I live in arizona, but spiders scare the -YAY- Out of me.
*NightSeas RUNS
<prince-dari> Well, whatever you watch, you're still better than people who watch shit like 90210, The Only Way Is Essex, and Geordie Shore.
<flutter_spin> oh man. One day I rushed into a dungeon in Skyrim (which I never do) and a spider came on top of me. The only thing in Skyrim that scared me
<Wrek> 05so much people!
<otakon> 10 Int + Skill Book Perk + Extra Skill Points Perk=maxed skills
<Ziltoidian> what are we watching?
<Wrek> 05currently on stream: Pink Floyd, PULSE: Live at Earls Court 1994
<Malefor> 4Yeah...
<Aircrafter> We are waching a acid trip Ziltoidian.
<Ziltoidian> Oh nice
<CriticKitten> And Midnight: Yeah, I'm growing tired of the original GW myself. I plan to complete enough of the Hall of Monuments to get all of the special bonus loot in GW2, and then stop.
<diddutz> flutter_spin: Isn't there a skyrim mod turning spiders in something else?
<The_4th_Wall> aCID
<NightSeas> 12no but really, I even like a few PBS shows :x
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: true... high intelligence made it easier to level your skills but they took that away in New Vegas which made that game much more interesting to me
<The_4th_Wall> ACID
<otakon> flutter_spin: don't play Amalur then, they have HUGE spiders that dramatically pop out
<Malefor> 4^Same...
<prince-dari> I have no idea what PBS is.
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: eeyup
<ScootaChicken> Wrek: Is there a CD of this particular performance?
<flutter_spin> Yes, there is a mod to turn spiders in wacky Spidermans
<prince-dari> I'm in the UK. :P
<Malefor> 4PBS is a kids channel dedicated to learning...
<Princess_Luna> I am a pony...a little filly...an alicorn...and still the Moon Princess...yet I must request a brushie.
<Kimori> eh not all kids related
<CriticKitten> Because I like having lots of free GW SWAG to carry around with me as I play.
<CriticKitten> :p
<Aircrafter> I'd be more scared of a crazy spiderman running at me then a spider itself.
<Kimori> but yeah learning in general
<Malefor> 4Most of the time...
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: though, when I hit level 50 i only had 1 skill that wasnt maxed... survival, cause i find it a useless skill
<flutter_spin> Like Fluttershy, I don't like to be scared :(
*The_4th_Wall brushes Princess_Luna
<prince-dari> Oh, shows like Dora the Explorer.
<Aircrafter> True that Midnight_Tempest
<Princess_Luna> Thank you 4th wall...I will try not to break you from now on...
<flutter_spin> because being startled can be quite startling
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: yh, it's kind of useless
<prince-dari> Speaking of which.
<Malefor> 4No... :P
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Gut~
<otakon> flutter_spin: swooping is bad?
<The_4th_Wall> I want one of these rigs in my room
*mario_pony brushes Princess_Luna's mane
<Malefor> 4Shows like CyberChase...
<Princess_Luna> Thank you...keep brushing...
<Aircrafter> Otakon: Alistair Reference?
<NightSeas> 1212PM-5PM Kids shows, 6PM-11AM other
*mario_pony keeps brushing
<CriticKitten> Oh, and fluttercry: I can find ya some YT links to the gameplay if you're interested. Best to look over that site I linked you first, though.
<Ziltoidian> brushy brushy
<Midnight_Tempest> Survival is only useful when you play the game on Hardcore mode... my god... so bloody hard...
<Princess_Luna> yay~
<The_4th_Wall> oh, it's not a problem
<fluttercry> 05,15I'll do that, thanks CriticKitten
<The_4th_Wall> because LUNA
<Malefor> 4Yeah...
<Aircrafter> I've always wanted too do hardcore but I chicken out all the time.
<MirrorImage> Midnight_Tempest - if you're talking about survival mode, i beg to differ
<NightSeas> 12it turns into KRWG when it's not playing kids shows
<Wrek> 05still enjoyign the stream then Aircrafter?
<Malefor> 4That's the only thing I can really watch when I'm home sick. :P
<MirrorImage> ...let me rephrase that
<otakon> I'll brb
<MirrorImage> if you're talking about Fallout new Vegas
<flutter_spin> hangon. My cat is acting up again
*MirrorImage needs caffeine
<Aircrafter> Yes Wrek. I am very much enjoying the acid trip you call a stream.
<NightSeas> 12same thing though
<unfoundbug> Princess_Luna, is there something wrong with your mane, it needs an aweful lot of brushing
<CriticKitten> No problem! It's become pretty much the only game I've ever gotten so psyched about, so I'm happy to help explain to others why. :P
<The_4th_Wall> my brothers cat is named opalescence
<otakon> lol
<Princess_Luna> Zitoidian? ^ ^ it does...yay~brushietime!
<Midnight_Tempest> MirrorImage: hardcore mode for Fallout New Vegas... its very hard when doing the DLC... dear god I died so often on Dead Money
<Princess_Luna> Sorry, wrong pony!
<flutter_spin> IZZY! Stop! ... don't eat my legos!
<MirrorImage> Midnight_Tempest - well that's dead money; it's stupidly hard to begin with
<MirrorImage> especially with the collar
<Ziltoidian> WIsh I had a brushable pony
<Midnight_Tempest> >_<
<Aircrafter> Dead money scared me the first time I played it. Like the security armor though.
<CriticKitten> Even have my main planned out. :3
<Princess_Luna> I am a pony...and brushable...
<Malefor> 4Yeah...
<CriticKitten> Rocking out the Ranger, and I will totally get a kitty for a pet. Because, well, duh. :3
<Aircrafter> Vault 34 was difficult for me. Too much radiation.
*The_4th_Wall brushes Princess_Luna some more
<Midnight_Tempest> Aircrafter: When I finally played all the DLC for NV, I finally understood all the references that were in Fallout: Equestria
<Princess_Luna> Brushies are so nice...thank you...
<MirrorImage> Midnight_Tempest - same
<Aircrafter> Midnight_Tempest: Lol. True. I still need too get into reading that.
<NewDCD> I'm around. Ping me once there's movement.
<The_4th_Wall> It's fun to brush
<MirrorImage> Aircrafter - what you do is you bookmark the page and set aside an hour or 2 a day to read a chapter
<derpy|With_Guest> He is still streaming
<NightSeas> 12I do wish PBS had some anime though
<Aircrafter> Its PonyKin...PONYBORN!
<MirrorImage> of course, being unemployeed helps, and i found myself giong through 4 or 5 chapters a day when i started
<NewDCD> Because low battery.
<Princess_Luna> I give up on finding a cure for the spell, I'm staying a filly for a while...even when it isn't fun...
*mario_pony loves to brush Princess_Luna
<Midnight_Tempest> its epic and you will actually LOVE the characters Aircrafter... like you will literally feel sorry for them, it's so well writen
<Malefor> 4I watch 4Kids for that...
*Princess_Luna loves being brushed
<Aircrafter> MirrorImage: Ya, Just alot too do...Like watch these streams @_@
<Aircrafter> I got into the first chapter and it seems nice already
<Red_Pegasus> Are we watching UFOs?
<prince-dari> I don't really regularly watch any cartoons other than MLP.
<Midnight_Tempest> ugh... that reminds me, Ive fallen behind on Fallout: Project Horizons... damn
<MirrorImage> Aircrafter - multitask; read the fic while watching the stream
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Princess_Luna: I'm almost done just need to work on the wing and color it
<Aircrafter> No Red_Pegasus. We are on a acid trip too Hell.
<Princess_Luna> Good!
<MirrorImage> yeah... Horizons has taken a turn for the silly the past 2 chapters, though it isn't entirely unwarranted
<Princess_Luna> I will wait then!
<NightSeas> 12I watch Cartoon network, 4Kids, and some Adult swim
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> No need to yell..
<Princess_Luna> Sorry...
<Morty> all the old bronies might hate me for this, but this music is putting me to sleep
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> It's okay :)
<Aircrafter> Gonna read it for a bit right now. So no dinging my name please? Danks.
*MirrorImage dings Aircrafter
<Princess_Luna> But I thought THIS WAS YELLINGA! Whoops...
<flutter_spin> Kitty is out of food. Isabel wants more, but I have to buy more.
<NightSeas> 12oh, and the hub
*The_4th_Wall is not old. 22 is a fine age
<Midnight_Tempest> dont say anything more MirrorImage, the story needed some silly in it... it was getting more depressing than I like
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Morty: I don't hate you I just don't agree with you that's all :)
*Princess_Luna is a filly, and loves being brushed
<flutter_spin> Yeah, I'm 26 and Mom still thinks I'm a kid
*mario_pony wishes he was older
<otakon> I am a older brony

<Malefor> 4>.>
*otakon is 27

<Morty> well technically, you can't disagree with the fact that this music is putting me to sleep

<The_4th_Wall> And aging gracefully.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: it is
<flutter_spin> You know the first time I went to get a job? August 2008 when I 23. Right when the market crashed.
<otakon> sad
<Aircrafter> I'm going too give a forecast of the story, eventually the main pony is going too be kicked out of , or escape the vault/whatever its called.

<Phase4|WindWaker> and i;m back
*mario_pony brushes Princess_Luna's mane slowly
<Midnight_Tempest> Aircrafter: they're called Stables

<flutter_spin> Then again, my best fried was kicked out of the house at 18. Lived in his car for a good year before getting a job.
<Phase4> hi diddutz
<emangamer> DerpyHooves`: sorry I missed your stream :'(
*Princess_Luna twitches and falls asleep*
<Wrek> 05currently on stream: Pink Floyd, PULSE: Live at Earls Court 1994
<otakon> Aircrafter: it's 2000+ pages, 49 chapters and over 600K words, it's good
<moop> too much lag :'(
<Aircrafter> I'm sure.
<NightSeas> 12awesome
<otakon> not on my end for once
<otakon> its' weird
<Midnight_Tempest> good is an understatment otakon
<emangamer> Ohai Wrek
<prince-dari> The "When I'm x" videos are pretty awesome too
<flutter_spin> Still good here.
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: indee
<Princess_Luna>
<Phase4> streans till broken here :'
<flutter_spin> Aw. Reminds me of Sting.
<Phase4> :'(
<otakon> ScootaChicken: no, I meant your parents knowing NOTHING of good music
<Cypresswolf> Quick question...Does youtube have a page where you can look up which video were previously deleted from your fav list?
<Malefor> 4Heh... I loved Hub for the Haunting Hour. ^^
<Princess_Luna> Forget that empty space qX
<otakon> Cypresswolf: eenope, try checking your history
<Midnight_Tempest> Aircrafter: When you do finish Fallout Equestria, read Fallout Project Horizons and Fallout Pink Eyes... those are both really epic too
<flutter_spin> ctrl H?
<Aircrafter> mmk.
<ScootaChicken> actually otakon, I wouldn't say nothing, my dad did introduce me to classical music, which I really like
<Cypresswolf> O_O Them I just lost an entire page of videos :|
<otakon> ah
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Be right back. .
<Wrek> 05prepare for lasershow

<The_4th_Wall> ctrl+shift+h
<DWR_Drawing> ScootaChicken go to bed then get out of it then get under it and sleep.
<Midnight_Tempest> they are FIRIN THEIR LAZERS!
<NightSeas> 12prince-dari, that last video should be looped XD
<otakon> Aircrafter: Pink Eyes is a little...... well OUT there even for Ponies and Fallout if you ask me though
<Princess_Luna> I will not read FO: E simply because that genre can get very cliche (not saying it is, I've never read it) and the sheer length of the fiction...
<ScootaChicken> DWR_Drawing: but I don't want to go under my bed, ehren is there
<Red_Pegasus> Then, we go back in time where everypony died.
<prince-dari> Heheh
<DWR_Drawing> That isn't ehren ScootaChicken <_< >_>
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: but it was still fun to read
<flutter_spin> I don't like reading, so I avoid the stories
<ScootaChicken> DWR_Drawing: who is it then?
<NightSeas> 12for.. 1 hour :D
<Red_Pegasus> I am immune to thy sezuires.
<otakon> Princess_Luna: we, let me put it this way, it kept me coming back till it was finished and I am notoriously finicky when it comes to good reading material.
<otakon> and it was a good and bad thing it ended
<DWR_Drawing> ScootaChicken How the hell do I know? I'm just a guy under your bed...I mean, I am your bed <_< >_>
<TwoTone> What is the worst Pink Floyd album?
<Aircrafter> Cherchez la Filly XD
<otakon> TwoTone: there ARE none
<prince-dari> I'd watch it looped for an hour.
<ScootaChicken> DWR_Drawing: O_o

<flutter_spin> The only ones I really know are Dark Side of the Moon
<The_4th_Wall> oscillating lights? BITCHPLZ
<ScootaChicken> wait a second DWR_Drawing... are you the voice inside my head I refuse to hear?
<Princess_Luna> I figured as much, but the only long running fic I have followed is Progress...well there are a couple others, but oh well...
<TwoTone> I am not a fan of The Final Cut
<Aircrafter> She had feelings with the female filly singer...
<Aircrafter> Oh god This is getting good already
<Red_Pegasus> flutter_spin: That sounds like Luna's music.
<Wrek> 05hows that for trippy Aircrafter ;3
<Aircrafter> O_O

<Ziltoidian> crazy frog is a sex offender is every state
<The_4th_Wall> Trans Siberian Orchestra

<Princess_Luna> Good, please do draw it...
<Wrek> 05i love how the lasers portay a cloudy sky in them
<RawketLawnchair> Princess Luna's cutie mark is the best. It makes her have the best nickname. Splotchbutt!
<flutter_spin> No, I don't have my cutie mark. I went to college for computers, working at a restaurant, good at nearly everything, yet no idea what kind of "career" to have
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha!
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: i see... do eeeet... i torrent stuff every day
<otakon> anyone else?
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Princess_Luna: Oh man you're gonna love this god damn drawing I swear :D

<ScootaChicken> TwoTone: my favourite is either Wish You Were Here or Pipers athe Gates of Dawn
<Princess_Luna> OK...can I see it yet?!
<otakon> Should I torrent System Shock 2?
<mario_pony> Princess_Luna: wana read it?
<Wrek> 05you should buy it of steam

<Ziltoidian> otakon you could probably get it somewhere else
<Wrek> 05its good enough to deserve that
<otakon> well maybe

<TwoTone> I was a flea market and picked up a special edition copy of Pipers at the gates of dawn.
<Jaketehsnake> Princess_Luna Personally, I only torrent games that 1) I have previously purchased but lost or 2) Older than 2003
<fluttercry> 05,15I don't think it's on Steam

<Midnight_Tempest> system shock 2 isnt on steam... i wish it was
<flutter_spin> But I'll do whatever anyone tells me to do. Right now no one is leading.
<otakon> well that's the thing
<diddutz> Princess_Luna: It's very short
<otakon> I can't find a direct dl version
<mario_pony> Princess_Luna: it's about a page long.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Black holes are black.
<unfoundbug> we just can't see the radiation they emit
<GabeMoist> Why can't they be asian, Nittany?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<GabeMoist> that's racists
<diddutz> Nittany_Discord: technicaln not, theyre just don't emmit light ...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No, they suck light up.
<prince-dari> Not that long ago he came and idled on the channel
<flutter_spin> Weird that I like Star Trek, but hate hearing scientists fight over theoretical science
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They emit energy around them.
<TwoTone> They cause the very light to BEND
<GabeMoist> black holes emit stuffs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not directly from them.
<The_4th_Wall> not black holes; singularities

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gravity bends light.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The sun and Earth do it.
<Malefor> Well, yeah... but it's inactive.... :T
<GabeMoist> That's what I said
<Jaketehsnake> Magnetism Bends Light
<prince-dari> He said he was going to keep it up forever, and sticks by that.
<flutter_spin> Stuff happens in space. There.

<unfoundbug> aliens did it

<derpy|With_Guest> Just pm me when he joins
<RAWRity> Listen guys: There has been NO reputable announcements on the length or content of Season 3. Could be 13 eps. Could be 26. Could be 4 TV movies. Could be just 10 straight hours of Rarity and FLuttershy giving the audience increasingly amorous looks. We have NO confirmation on any of this.
<Aircrafter> 6w9
<otakon> it's not IN THE OFFICIAL RULES PAGE YET THOUGH, HINT HINT!
<Wrek> 05 /)
<Aircrafter> LOL
<The_4th_Wall> it's Wrek
<pony_8859> L. GaGa looks weird
<KernelCobb> RAWRity i would be perfectly okay with ANY of those options
<otakon> RAWRity: mfw it's the last one
<flutter_spin> http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=533 is probably the only one I like.
<Jaketehsnake> Aircrafter You are in for an Amazing treat. So much Adventure. Happy, Sad, A bit of romance in there too :3
<TheDr> rawrity: i hope not that lol
<Wrek> 05ACOUSTIC
<Wrek> 05FTW
*otakon drinks lukewarm Budweiser
<emangamer> Why do people think that Luna was banished on the moon. Episode 1 clearly says IN the moon and when Nightmare Moon was free the face in the moon dissappeared. So it's not like she was up there dancing on the moon for 1000 years.
*SaxyPretender grabs a lighter and starts waving it in the year.
<otakon> emangamer: it's only a joke
<Jaketehsnake> Aircrafter I have every chapter on my kindle. It makes Fanfics so easy yo read.
<otakon> emangamer: bc it's funny
<Aircrafter> Mlp Romance?
<Aircrafter> Shipping Man...
<flutter_spin> It is just another silly joke

<KernelCobb> why don't we have an accoustic pony?
<otakon> bye TheDr come back soon!
<pony_8859> who is e
<KernelCobb> accoustic playing pony*
<Aircrafter> I like the audio books.
*Jaketehsnake I dont smoke But I have a zippo :3
<KernelCobb> one developed for hooves of course
<Aircrafter> Easier too read.
<otakon> KernelCobb: there's AcousticBrony on Youtube
<KernelCobb> I mean in the show itslef
<KernelCobb> a cannon
<TheDr> i will be on agian in a few hourse :)
<otakon> oh good point
<Jaketehsnake> Aircrafter Is the narrarator any good?
<flutter_spin> I never liked the whole pony&pony romance thrown in everywhere either. Just something people do I guess.
*KernelCobb is not intentionly spelling things wrong :(
<Aircrafter> hes a guy
<Aircrafter> But ya
<Aircrafter> He narrates better than most people would.
<otakon> Aircrafter: eeyup
<RAWRity> personally, I think it'd be a good end to the show as a whole if we got a 13 ep Season, and then a TV movie to act as a capstone to the whole hurrah.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: there's also me...
<pony_8859> i think this dude is a damn good singer:D
<KernelCobb> MLP FiM full length movie....all of my money...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I like that idea, RAWRity
<otakon> ScootaChicken: oh yeah, sorry I forgot about you ScootaChicken
<Yahooz> dem grammys?
<flutter_spin> If anything, just show them in 2parts like the season openers
<The_4th_Wall> ^
<flutter_spin> Those 4 episodes alone are in my top 10
<unfoundbug> RAWRity an end? blasphemy
<otakon> I still say Season 2 operner should have been a three parter
<KernelCobb> i agree with unfoundbug...it must never end
<unfoundbug> no where near enough luna yet
<Jaketehsnake> Aircrafter, I dont know how I feel about narrators, when I am reading, I might accidentaly skip over information, but I dont like it to take forever to read
<otakon> guys lets face it
<KernelCobb> when it is about to end, we must take over
<otakon> it WILL end one day
<KernelCobb> and continue it
<Yahooz> I agree otakon Season two premeire was a bit rushed
<Red_Pegasus> Hi everypony.
<The_4th_Wall> No it needs to end sometime
<Aircrafter> Know what ya mean Jaketehsnake
<otakon> but it's the memories we keep from it that will last
<RAWRity> unfoundbug: I would rather the show be only 3-4 Good seasons, then have it overstay its welcome and degrade *cough* Simpsons *cough*
<otakon> hiya Red_Pegasus wb
<KernelCobb> if they end g4 ponies, sometime later they will come out with g5 ponies
<pony_8859> is this finally over
<KernelCobb> for the toys
<flutter_spin> The problem I face is that each episode is treated as a stand-alone episode. There is no progression between the episodes (or very little to notice)
<otakon> RAWRity: you do know The Simpsons is still funny, right?
<RAWRity> otakon: haha no
<KernelCobb> otakon good point
<unfoundbug> no its not
<otakon> flutter_spin: there is continutiny
<Wrek> 05im already workign on g5 ones xD
<otakon> just not TONS of it
<Yahooz> its lost its appeal ever since the movie
<KernelCobb> king of the hill lasted a VERY long time
<The_4th_Wall> when quantity>quality is when I sue Hasbro for all money they've ever made off me
<RAWRity> Simpsons has been going on twice as long as it ever should have.
<otakon> Wrek: you and you lanky G5 style
<Yahooz> O Wrek u so silly :3
<Jaketehsnake> Aircrafter What I think I'll do Is read the whole series not know what will happen, Enjoy it and have it be epic. Then I will listen to the whole series through again on auidobook :D
<flutter_spin> Like the Luna episode... everyone was freaking out except Twilight. Seriously? Twilight was the only sane one?
<RAWRity> inb4 all of Wrek's ponies end up looking like Slendermane
<Aircrafter> Well thats gonna take awhile then Jaketehsnake.
<pony_8859> is going to be over anytime soon
<mario_pony> KernelCobb: i never really got king of the hill was it supposed to be funny or hat?
<KernelCobb> g5 ponies will be EVEN SLIMMER and have even PONTIER noses
<Wrek> 05my DA is proof of that KernelCobb
<KernelCobb> mario_pony people liked it for its realistic humor, making fun of real life things
<RAWRity> G5 Ponies will only be stick figures with highly detailed manes
<KernelCobb> link it to me wrek
<emangamer> oh otakon. Did shy ever finish any other parts of her fic?
<otakon> indeed
<flutter_spin> King of the Hill had some humor, but it was out in left field
<Wrek> 05johntb.deviantart.com
<Jaketehsnake> Aircrafter, I don't care! I LEIK FANFICTION! also, this one seems different, very well written,. There were a few plot twists that just slapped me in the face
<otakon> emangamer: I don't think so
<Yahooz> Shy is writing a fic?
<otakon> yh
<Aircrafter> I mean listening too it on the audiobook...He dont read that fast.
<emangamer> for shame...it had potential
<otakon> that's news to me actually
<Wrek> 05drunk
<RAWRity> Jaketehsnake: what fic are you talking about?
*otakon is drinking his second Budweiser now....
<Jaketehsnake> Fallout Equestria
<mario_pony> did anypony read Pegasister16's fanfic?
<otakon> enope
<Yahooz> I did...
<emangamer> Yahooz: WROTE part of a fic...so far only part one is done
<Yahooz> interesting concept
*The_4th_Wall is now watching wrek
<Jaketehsnake> As a HUGE fan of the fallout series, it really hit home with me
<otakon> I didn't even know she had one
<emangamer> mario_pony: she is a nice pony...
<KernelCobb> wrek i wouldn't consider those g5, just differently drawn g4
<otakon> Jaketehsnake: agreed, same here
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ahh, my favorite Pink FLoyd song
<Wrek> 05KernelCobb, its an inside joke really
<otakon> lol
<otakon> yh
<KernelCobb> besides, who knows, it's possible g5 may end up looking like g2.....
<otakon> inside joke
*KernelCobb shudder
<Yahooz> emangamer: well im sure she might continue it. dont expect her to come out with a part two so fast
<mario_pony> yeah it was about dashie comming to real world and meeting chuckie.
<otakon> like LEVERAGE
<otakon> um
<KernelCobb> wrek oh i see, i never get those
<otakon> which Chuckie?
<unfoundbug> we would have to really piss hasbro off for that to happen
<emangamer> Yahooz: I dont, but it was a while ago and something reminded me of it.
<Wrek> 05and now
<emangamer> otakon: the evil killer doll one
<Wrek> 05solo!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14say, Wrek, do they play Money in this concert? If so, did I miss it already?
<RAWRity> "Me and Casey. We used to get drunk before we did the dishes. Me and Casey would get high and listen to our boredom.
<mario_pony> otakon the evil possesed doll
<RAWRity> "
<otakon> emangamer: oh god why?
<Jaketehsnake> aircrafter Do not lose faith. At a few pooints it may be a bit slow but trust me, It gets better
<flutter_spin> Did anyone notice the building designs in Hearts & Hooves. Those were some insane details
<Wrek> 05you missed it SaxyPretender
<SaxyPretender> 0,14darn
<emangamer> otakon: she is a large chucky fan
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but imokwiththissolo
<otakon> once again, yikes
<ScootalooWonderloo> hey
<RAWRity> Question: What band/musician do you feel is criminally overrated?
<KernelCobb> did anyone notice the pairing of Derpy and Doctor Whooves in Hearts and Hooves?
<otakon> I HATE Child's Play overall
<otakon> KernelCobb: eeyup
<Jaketehsnake> I did
<KernelCobb> ;)
<flutter_spin> No, not even the first 3 times.
<otakon> lol
<KernelCobb> lol flutter_spin
<pony_8859> i want to go to bed so bad but me and my dad are going hunting in 7 minutes
<otakon> yikes
<flutter_spin> EQD had to show it before I noticed
<mario_pony> otakon: those movies scared the s**t outa me as a child.
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Huzzah! It's finished!
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> :)
<flutter_spin> I DID notice Dr. Hooves splashing the second time
*RAWRity Find's Child's Play too ridiculous to be scared.
<otakon> mario_pony: true, but the last ones were utter garbage and not worth the money it took to see them in theaters
<pony_8859> have you ever seen the corn children
<otakon> TOY_PON3|Drawing: SHOW US!
<KernelCobb> same scene as derpy and doctor whooves...bon bon appeares twice..in the same position...lazy animating
<pony_8859> SCARY
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> hold on i need to take a picture.
<Wrek> 05dat ceilign thing!
<mario_pony> otakon you're right the last ones were just funny not scary
<flutter_spin> I'm surprised EQD didn't know why there was a dunce hat. Sheesh, come on!
*TOY_PON3|Drawing takes asprin and drinks a whole bottle of water in one drink
<Jaketehsnake> MASSIVE BALL ACTION
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> There..
<KernelCobb> wrek that's the portal to equestria
<RAWRity> KernelCobb: more like animating on a budget of chewing gum and pocket lint.
<Wrek> 05aye
<KernelCobb> RAWRity: I know! They need more funding
<RAWRity> They aren't gonna get it though.
<otakon> mario_pony: not even FUNNY! Just DREK at that point! I paid money to see DOLL TITS in a major theater. $27 bucks altogether, it was HORRIBLE!
<KernelCobb> screw health care, give hasbro money!
<KernelCobb> america i mean
<The_4th_Wall> Scratch Shortcake from hub then
<flutter_spin> I dreamed I went through a portal to Equestria. The rest was, well, its a long story.
<Wrek> 05you kinda brought that upon youself if you actually thought it was a good idea to watch a movie named doll tits
<KernelCobb> flutter_spin i'm jealous
<RAWRity> Hasbro's entire business plan is about keeping the advertising (aka The Show) cheap as hell so they can optimize profits from the toy sales.
<mario_pony> otakon you payed to see doll tits did you not know about the internet back then?
<Jaketehsnake> I think we have all had those dreams flutter_spin. They are awesome byond words
<MasterBrony> look at this pic! i dawwwwwwwwwwwwd
<MasterBrony> http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/180700_1875401726290_1278613072_32252323_2013160_n.jpg\
<otakon> mario_pony: I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GETTING DOLL tata's!
<KernelCobb> RAWRity at least their toys are getting less and less lazy. they made celestia white finally for example
<KernelCobb> now all we need is an applejack with a correclty colored hat
<mario_pony> otakon i know i'm just kidding.
<flutter_spin> At least they are giving me another chance at McD toys!
<The_4th_Wall> FINALLY
<RAWRity> KernelCobb: just took em over a year.
<Jaketehsnake> thats all folks
<KernelCobb> RAWRity: yea, JUST a whole friggin year
<Wrek> 05and now for the best part in this entire concert
<Wrek> 05crank it up
<KernelCobb> can't wait
<Wrek> 05cause we are lifting roofs!
<KernelCobb> strong
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Not my roof!
<Jaketehsnake> I get the feeling wou went to this concert Wrek
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I need that to protect me from the old!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*Cold
<RAWRity> So, I checked my wal-mart for blind bags today. They DID have a box of Mystery figurines in the MLP section...but it was for something called "la La loopy" or some shit.

<KernelCobb> RAWRity i believe blind bags are toys r us exclusive
<flutter_spin> McDonalds will be my ticket. Just one month
<Aircrafter> This is a little creepeh.

<unfoundbug> oh this song
<LordCelestia> 0,5>>>
<KernelCobb> it's sad that mcdonalds can produce higher quality plastic figurines than hasbro themself
<GabeMoist> oh....
<RAWRity> LordCelestia has been taken over by Taz! RUN!
<GabeMoist> I feel stupid now
<mario_pony> gives soul food to LordCelestia
<Randall1160> I like this song a lot
<Aircrafter> I...I cant stand the sad fluttershy...
<Aircrafter> T_T
<GabeMoist> LordCelestia
<Princess_Luna> I see a drawing and that one song in the video Clash!
<GabeMoist> Sorry
<Aircrafter> o_o
<RAWRity> KernelCobb: what makes you say they're higher quality?
<GabeMoist> My soul belongs to SB64
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> So for any of you who clicked on my link did you like my drawing?
<Cypresswolf> RawkettLawnChair, Have you seen PMV Hallejah? That one will make you cry faster
<Aircrafter> I think it was perfecto Toy_Pon3
<mario_pony> i loved it!!
<KernelCobb> RAWRity the blind bag figurines have all the same pose. EX: RD's and fluttershy's
<fillyfillyy> TOY_PON3|Drawing i got DCd will you send me the link i never saw it
<Cypresswolf> *Hallelujah
<KernelCobb> Mcdonalds figurines are unique
*TOY_PON3|Drawing wishes he could draw like Wrek
<TOY_PON3|Drawing> Someday..
<KernelCobb> that's the only thing i mean by higher quality
<KernelCobb> the poses
*mario_pony cries with fluttershy
*GabeMoist wishes he could draw
<RawketLawnchair> Cypresswolf: PMV's are stupid. You're stupid.
<mario_pony> i gotta refresh brb
<Randall1160> alas for all the mods have gone quiet
*Princess_Luna wishes she had a portal gun from when she went to Aperture science
<Randall1160> ALL THE MODS!
<flutter_spin> People have said that the new McDonalds toys are the "closest" to the series
<flutter_spin> But the toys in the blindbags seem good too
<GabeMoist> Hipster is my favorite mod
<Cypresswolf> *rasberries in Rawketts direction* :P
<KernelCobb> flutter_spin my point exaclty

<moop> But since we all know that equestria is Earth in a couple thousand years (here being my proff http://derpy.me/Y-mmP) also if you think that if its song long in the future why is the tire still around? Tires dont fall apart in fact thay will last millions of years. Also It must be the same planet because there are ponies, One sun one moon, Similar atmosphere, they have books and other similar technological advances. Twilight Point

<otakon> Nittany_Discord: your okay
<Cypresswolf> This should be the Technical Difficulties Music!
<otakon> Phase4: I have NO idea

<RAWRity> what's bad is, Minaj actually does have a good flow as a rapper. It's just tahat her production is almost always shit.
<TOY_PON3> d'awww
<Cypresswolf> Mods! Space is 20% Cooler music for Tech Difficulties theme? What say you?
<MahBoi777> The_4th_Wall: I hope you enjoy all dat cheese, LOL

<Cypresswolf> Take ALL My Money!
<TOY_PON3> RAWRity: I take it that's why you hate her?
<The_4th_Wall> $1250 in food stamps, so yeah.
<RAWRity> Gotta say, I'm not totally hating this Minaj song. If nothing else she at least is putting effort into this whole thing.
<RAWRity> TOY_PON3: pretty much.
<TOY_PON3> lol
<MahBoi777> cheesy goodness
<TOY_PON3> mmmm...cheese
<TOY_PON3> dat stretch
<RAWRity> For instance, her verse on Kanye West's "Monster" is pretty good.
<MahBoi777> :D
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord: the steams still frozen where it crashed for me
<The_4th_Wall> Spent $145 on groceries 2 days ago; already eaten $80 worth
<TOY_PON3> I love Kanye West tbh
<The_4th_Wall> TRUE STORY
<MahBoi777> The_4th_Wall: good man, I would have done the same thing
<RAWRity> Kanye frustrates me when it comes to his music. He can produce some absolutely fantastic music when he's doing the sound mix, but he is a sub-par rapper most of the time.
<The_4th_Wall> Spent $45 on chips and dips and soda
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Restarting stream
<RAWRity> also, his public persona doesn't exactly make defending him any easier.

<Midnight_Tempest> delicious
<RAWRity> Although it's damn obvious that Adele is, again, going to win Album of the Year, I think Born This Way is the better album.
<MahBoi777> they have play-dough ice cream?
<The_4th_Wall> Because PLAY-DOUGH ICE CREAM
<Randall1160> Noooooooo I crashed
<The_4th_Wall> ya
<MahBoi777> I NEVER KNEW DAT
<The_4th_Wall> made by Farr better ice cream
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity: I think the Grammy's should get fire bombed... and nothing of value will be lost
<The_4th_Wall> is yellow, pink, and blue
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I bet mainstream music won mostly.
<Midnight_Tempest> pfft... mainstream...
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: ...well DUH. That's kind of how it works.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01i.e. the ones the record labels advertise the most.
<Derpy_Hooves> 10:14v here
<Tovler> Because Look at Me Now was such an amazing song.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Burn the RIAA and MPAA. They're trying to fuck with the govt.

<Lulu> I have to leave now my boyfriend is waking up soon and he's gonna rage at me if i'm still up.. i'll talk to you tomorrow
<RAWRity> if you've gotten nominated for a Grammy, it's BECAUSE you've had a huge amount of hits over the past year, if not longer.
<TOY_PON3> ^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Something is seriously wrong with my computer, I need to restart it, sorry, brb
<MahBoi777> note: try play-dough ice cream at one point in life
<RAWRity> and seeing as Adele had the #1 hit of the year, she's pretty much guaranteed at least a half-dozen.

<GabeofThrones> I thought it was time well spent
<mario_pony> it keeps freezing on me.
<GabeofThrones> definitely good when sleep deprived
<RAWRity> really, probably my biggest problem with the grammys (outside of the fact that they gave anything other than dirty looks to Chris Brown) is that they're almost always completely predictable.
<Midnight_Tempest> SB had to restart his comp, so we need to wait for him to get back for the stream to restart too
<MahBoi777> Nicholas Cage loses his s:[ to the tune of Livin in the Sunlight? yea, I would watch that LOL
<The_4th_Wall> Anyone want my number? i need random texts.

<Shizuka> 13i am not going anywhere .-.
<TOY_PON3> lol
<Private614> LOL
<Phase4> oh, its lc that left
<Phase4> nvm then, hi Shizuka
<Midnight_Tempest> mario_pony: its usually on fridays on NBC around... 7 pm MST i think
*LadyCanary wubs Shizuka.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14see, RAWRity, that's why I don't have my ex on my FB anymore
<SaxyPretender> 0,14out of sight
<Shizuka> 13<3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14out of mind
<RawketLawnchair> Shizuka:
<RawketLawnchair> Put up a stream.
<The_4th_Wall> my alter ego is calmer than a sleeping kitten.
<LadyCanary> I feel dat SaxyPretender.
<Shizuka> 13but..
<Shizuka> 13.-.
<mario_pony> Midnight_Tempest: cool i'll make sure to watch it.
<TOY_PON3> Okay not sure if I should watch Grammys or Young Frakenstein?
<LadyCanary> Young Frankenstein :3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Young Frankenstein
<TwoTone> ^^
<RawketLawnchair> Do it, Shizuka
<TOY_PON3> Thanks ^^
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: Problem with that: we're still friends for the most part, but she...has some rather severe psychological issues.
<Shizuka> 13but... it's SB time..
<Midnight_Tempest> mario_pony: i think you can watch the previous episodes on the NBC website... you should check there first
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah
<SaxyPretender> 0,14gotcha
<Shizuka> 13at least i think .-.
<The_4th_Wall> MEANWHILE, I'm developing kidney stones cause noone wants to shoot my cell random texts
<Private614> Guys, got a dilemma here.
<mario_pony> Midnight_Tempest: will do
<The_4th_Wall> Amber hasn't rang all day
<Phase4> yes prince-dari
<Phase4> i meen Private614
<Midnight_Tempest> lets not demand anything of Shizuka... we dont have the right to demand anything of the mods
<RAWRity> so occasionally she can get into a rather unstable mood. and that's when I get 4 am phone calls about suicide.\
<LadyCanary> My ex was...whiny to say the least. A real Debbie Downer.
<MahBoi777> what's the problem Private614?
<LadyCanary> Isnt that a bit unsettling for you RAWRity?
*kirzstryfe glomps Midnight_Tempest
*Midnight_Tempest is glomped :$
<Private614> Which should I watch first of Doctor Who, the old season(1st-7th) or the new season(8th-11th)?
<TOY_PON3> My ex was a bitch :)
<Phase4> hmmm
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: Kinda gotten used to it after 4 years, tbh. I just have to talk her down, remind her that whatever's going on, she'll get through it, and remind her to take her medication.
<TwoTone> Is all of it an option?
<Phase4> old or new doctor?
<RAWRity> Got it down to checklist practically.
<Private614> New doctor.
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: Gotcha.
<MahBoi777> new maybe?
*The_4th_Wall glomps his left foot violently
<TOY_PON3> new doctor
<SaxyPretender> 0,14New Doctor
<Private614> The 8th to 11th.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you get to tennant faster
*Midnight_Tempest noms on kirzstryfe
<Private614> Ok, sarge.
*Placebo is best doctor.
*The_4th_Wall is now bleeding profusely
<MahBoi777> hello Placebo
<LadyCanary> Hey Placebo! Nice to see you!
<RAWRity> also, New season is on 9-11.
<Placebo> Ohai LadyCanary, MahBoi777 , everyone.
<TOY_PON3> Placebo darling!
<GabeofThrones> More impirtantly, you get to Matt Smith faster
<TOY_PON3> <3
<RAWRity> 8 only had the TV Movie in the mid 90's
<Placebo> TOY_PON3: <3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14haha, GabeofThrones
<Private614> Oh, I thought it started with 8th.
<MahBoi777> oh gawd, this again
<Private614> Silly me.
<Placebo> xD
<GabeofThrones> dari's favorite doctor is Matt Smith
<LadyCanary> inb4 dari rage.

<TOY_PON3> lol
<LadyCanary> GabeofThrones...WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
<GabeofThrones> make sure you tell him how much you love Smith
<Placebo> :D
<RAWRity> nah, 8 is the one most don't like to talk about. After all, The TV movie was made BY FOX.
<TwoTone> The ninth is my favouite, I find he never gets enough love.
<mario_pony> Midnight_Tempest: WHATS THE WEBSITE?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14For all the joking I do
<Private614> Gonna start watching after Hearts and Hooves Day
<Placebo> What's with the Dr. Who talk? What'd I miss?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I admit that Tennant is much better than Smith
<Michael4thCox> Because my number is not important
<MahBoi777> Private614 started it lol
<Phase4> smith isnt bad though
<GabeofThrones> Placebo, we're talking about dari's favorite doctor
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but Smith is MY Doctor, because there's something I like
<GabeofThrones> Matt Smith
<Placebo> Oh, I see.
<Phase4> they should stop writing him like tennant
<Midnight_Tempest> mario_pony: i just checked and they dont have the all the full episodes up for it... only about 5 episodes and not including the trailer http://www.nbc.com/grimm/
<Placebo> Doctor House is best doctor. Period.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol, don't let dari catch you saying stuff like that :)
*Michael4thCox is broken, shattered, andlost
<Phase4> ohai kirzstryfe
<GabeofThrones> I like the third doctor
<Midnight_Tempest> mario_pony: i meant pilot episode

<Midnight_Tempest> :O
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, i was watching an episode of Futurama today

<Armageddon> Drake
<Drake> 04FUCK
*Drake hides
<Armageddon> XD
*Armageddon slaps Drake
<Armageddon> go fix your drawing
<Drake> 04nou
<Armageddon> ):
<Armageddon> okay Drake
<Armageddon> we need to focus on the storyline
*Armageddon slaps Drake
*Drake avoids
<Drake> 04fuck woman
<Drake> 04I'm not here 24/7
<Armageddon> unfortunately
<Armageddon> though, Drake, sometimes I think you're more of an asshole than I am :3
<Drake> 04That's a bit of a stretch don't you think?
<Armageddon> okay fine, Drake ):
<Armageddon> but anyway
<Armageddon> What happens after the airport?
<Drake> 04Like I said
<Drake> 04we head to the HQ
<Drake> 04Parachute out
<Drake> 04get told we work or die
<Drake> 04and sleep in Leo's room for the night
<Drake> 04After that
<Armageddon> Leo should be like
<Armageddon> *lays out newspaper*
<Drake> 04We get on a flight to the US
<Drake> 04and start our training
<Armageddon> "This is your bed, and that's yours. The pile of lollies is your dinner."
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> Don't you mean Canada?
<Drake> 04The "beds" being blankets on the floor
<Drake> 04w/e
<Armageddon> The "beds" are newspaper :{D
<Armageddon> because Leo is horrible at taking care of children
<Armageddon> 8D
<Armageddon> well canada
<Xanbreon> No such thing as more of an arsehole than NS
<Armageddon> and Rhy pushes leo into a lake
<Armageddon> :D
<Armageddon> hah Xanbreon
<Xanbreon> ;)
<Xanbreon> ohhaime
*Xanbreon rapes Veyka
<Drake> 04anyway
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04After the 9 months of training, which include anything we can think of
<Test> sonofabitch
<Drake> 04We are basically sent on our first mission
<Drake> 04somewhere
<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04Your turn. Shoot.
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> I thought YOU wanted to go into detail about the training, Drake
<Drake> 04I do.
<Armageddon> As we said yesterday, CQC, trainer touches Rhy on the should to "comfort her"
<Armageddon> Rhy breaks his nose
<Drake> 04Then BAM
<Armageddon> Leo stands to the side clapping
<Drake> 04And Nathan is like "Holy shit"
<Armageddon> And Nathan is shitting on the floor laughing
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04And then when rifle training comes around Rhy's like "How do I hold this thing?" and almost shoots Nathan
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> yes
<Armageddon> And Nathan's like "Rhy, bitch!"
<Armageddon> "STOP TRYING TO KILL ME"
<Drake> 04"PUT THE GUN DOWN"
<Armageddon> And Leo's like "Rhy, put the damn gun down."
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> I say this is PG-13+, yes?
<Drake> 04And then Nathan aces the markmanship test
<Drake> 04I was thinking M
<Armageddon> Yes, M
<Drake> 04because shooting and blood and gore
<Armageddon> And Rhy ends up shooting the trainer in the leg
<Drake> 04and swearing
<Armageddon> 8D
<Drake> 04and implied sex
<Drake> 04sure
<Armageddon> yeah okay
<Armageddon> :D
<Drake> 04Actually
<Drake> 04not Rhy
<SilverSonic> ...
<Drake> 04She gets to punch the other trainer
<Armageddon> What, SilverSonic?
<Armageddon> okay fine
<SilverSonic> dunno
<Armageddon> but she's horrible at marksmanship
<Drake> 04Nathan accidentally switches off the safety and shoots him
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> okay!
<Armageddon> And Leo is pissing himself laughing then
<SilverSonic> just felt like getting words in for randomnesss
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> Drake
<SilverSonic> i could do a session of typing where i dont correct my mistakes
<Armageddon> Leo's gonna be like
<Armageddon> "I love you guys."
<Armageddon> And the trainer's gonna be like
<Armageddon> "FUCK YOU BOTH"
<Armageddon> "I SWEAR THIS IS YOUR SETUP, LEONARD"
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> And Leo'll be like "Yep."
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> anyway Drake
<Drake> 04Then comes bomb disposal
<Drake> 04DUN
<Drake> 04DUN
<Armageddon> rooooooofl
<Drake> 04DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
<Drake> 04CUT THE RED WIRE
<Armageddon> wait, who's the tech/mechanic?
<Drake> 04JUST TURN OFF THE TIMER YOU IDIOT
<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04Nathan is the software guy
<Drake> 04I imagine Leo's the actual electronics guy
<Armageddon> Rhy's the mechanic then?
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Armageddon> dunno
<Armageddon> because see
<Drake> 04Rhy's the mechanic, Leo works with hardware, Nathan works with software
<Armageddon> Rhy needs to know about mechanics
<Armageddon> because aircraft
<Drake> 04obviously
<Drake> 04mechanics != electronics
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04I figured they'd all work together in upgrading the Skyscraper
<Armageddon> though it'd be mainly Rhy still
<Armageddon> and I suppose Rhy would bitch if they did anything she didn't like
<Drake> 04Nathan does the coding on any of the more elaborate functions of the on-board computer, Leo fixes up an problems in the wiring, and Rhy makes the actual upgrades
<Drake> 04like weapons, armor etc.
<Armageddon> Well sure
<Drake> 04Anywho
<Drake> 04First mission
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> it'd have to be something that'd stir up stuff
<Armageddon> but not something huge like murdering a president or anything
<Drake> 04Encroaching on neighbouring territory?
<Armageddon> encroaching?
<Drake> 04Messing up a communication outpost?
<Drake> 04Like, setting up something on land not actually owned by you.
<Drake> 04LIke Russia setting up a com outpost in US soil.
<Armageddon> Well
<Drake> 04I figured the first mission
<Drake> 04Would be
<Armageddon> I don't think our first mission should be long
<Drake> 04Us three and some back up
<Drake> 04Find a US com outpost
<Armageddon> maybe destroying a US com outpost and destroy it?
<Armageddon> er
<Armageddon> finding
<Armageddon> whatever
<Drake> 04Sneak in, break some stuff (dressed as Russians) and plant something that allows our contractor to stop the function of the outpost at his signal?
<Drake> 04Because breaking it and leaving doesn't help. They'll just fix it.
<Drake> 04Maybe a small remote-detonated bomb that isn't too powerful, but can be triggered from very far away?
<Drake> 04Dressed as a Russian spec-ops team, we break in, do our stuff, and leave.
<Drake> 04Hired by China, the US thinks Russia broke the outpost but doesn't have definite proof.
<Drake> 04Things start stirring up between the two nations.
<Armageddon> I thought you said you wanted Russia and US to be on the same team
<Armageddon> therefore it'd make sense for us to break into the outpost as chinese-dressed people and China pinned as the culprits
<Armageddon> though
<Armageddon> it wouldn't make sense
<Drake> 04Exactly
<Armageddon> for military people sneaking/breaking in
<Armageddon> to be dressed as their nation
<Drake> 04Us and RUssia start hating each other but by the end they realise China/Japanw as behind it
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04somehow
<Drake> 04I dunno
<Armageddon> I wasn't talking about the culprit not making sense
<Armageddon> but the sneaking/breaking in
<Armageddon> somehow we'd have to leave behind proof
<Armageddon> but not obvious
<Armageddon> accidental
<Drake> 04Dropping a Russian emblem?
<Drake> 04Russian dog tags
<Drake> 04?*
<Drake> 04That isn't solid enough proof for retaliation
<Armageddon> That's way too careless
<Armageddon> any china-specific/russia-specific bullets?
<Drake> 04Probably.
<Armageddon> or weaponry
<Armageddon> find some
<Drake> 04Weaponry definitely
<Armageddon> that'd be good enough
<Armageddon> and it wouldn't seem like it's done on purpose
<Drake> 04Leave behind a pistol
<Armageddon> no
<Armageddon> bullets should be enough
<Armageddon> but if we have to
<Armageddon> a pistol will do
<Armageddon> no fingerprints though
<Armageddon> will need to be careful on that
<Armageddon> Rhy wears gloves anyway so that doesn't matter
<Armageddon> dunno about Nathan and Leo
<Drake> 04When you're in a combat zone
<Drake> 04wearing gloves is an obvious idea
<Armageddon> yeah true
<Armageddon> but for guns it's a bit blunky
<Armageddon> clunky
<Drake> 04Not really
<Armageddon> for close range, SAP gloves etc. add weight to punches and so on
<Drake> 04Unless Nathan's sniping
<Armageddon> and protect fingers and hands about stuff
<Drake> 04Which he won't be
<Armageddon> yeah well, doubt he will
<Armageddon> they'll go in through the ventilation
<Armageddon> They drop on the surprised US fags
<Armageddon> and kill them
<Armageddon> then Nathan comes back BAWWWWWWWWWWWing
<Armageddon> and Rhy's like "I lost my innocence, and not to Nathan either"
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Nathan won't be like that
<Drake> 04He just won't kill at first
<Armageddon> yeah well
<Drake> 04Then second or third mission
<Armageddon> there has to be trauma
<Drake> 04have to kill someone
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04Then comes the angst
<Armageddon> they can't kill everyone I suppose
<Armageddon> that'd be too much
<Armageddon> for a mission like that
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9x18mm_Makarov
<Drake> 04Soviet bullet
<Drake> 04awesome
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Armageddon> if they kill too many people it'll be bad
<Drake> 04For a pistol as well
<SilverSonic> http://store.steampowered.com/app/111100/ needs more snuggle trucks *random*
<Drake> 04Exactly
*SilverSonic hides
<Armageddon> awesome
<Drake> 04it's covert mission
<Drake> 04not a kill everyone on sight mission
<Armageddon> Yeh
<Armageddon> Yeah
<Armageddon> I suppose they'll just murder everyone in the main control room
<Drake> 04Break a few thingsw
<Drake> 04So it's not suspicious
<Armageddon> where the three of them fuck up the electronics while the other teams go for the generator
<Drake> 04And then plant the bomb and run
<Armageddon> and yeah
<Armageddon> generator blows up
<Armageddon> but the control room should remain somewhat intact
<Drake> 04NS
<Armageddon> and the guys remain intact
<Drake> 04they aren't destroying the base
<Drake> 04They're damaging it
<Drake> 04Because blowing it up is kind of suspicious
<Drake> 04Plus the US would then enter a panic
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> it'd make sense to damage the generator at least
<Armageddon> but not cause an outright explosion Drake
<Drake> 04Don't blow it up though
<Armageddon> that's kinda what I meant, sorry
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> two-team mission
<Drake> 04Our team goes for the control tower, the other team does the generator
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> we all use the Makarov bullets
<Armageddon> except Rhy does some knife wounds without the energy blade
<Armageddon> otherwise that'd be too obvious
<Armageddon> but she's not carving them up or anything
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04Slit their throat when they aren't looking
<Armageddon> just disabling them long enough to not be a threat
<Armageddon> yeah, that'd be okay to do
<Drake> 04Rhy would still be nervous about killing for the first time mind you
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04But she'd be over it by the end of the mission
<Armageddon> I don't think she'd try to kill
<Armageddon> just wound enough to disable them
<Armageddon> until Leo's hammers them with bullets
<Armageddon> at least at the beginning
<Armageddon> until the control room
<Drake> 04One or two of them will die by her hand though
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> anyway brb dinner
<Drake> 04So she's like "Oh...well, ok"
<Drake> 04k
<prince-dari> Yeah, I'll go to bed Vi. Though isn't it 8 am for you now?
<prince-dari> And you're not well, you shouldn't be missing out on sleep.
<prince-dari> But yes, I need to sleep. Cya later.
<Armageddon> okay Drake
<Armageddon> back
*Armageddon slaps Drake
<Davie_Jones> knock knock
<Armageddon> XELI
*Armageddon hugs
<Espeon|School> ~
*Espeon|School cling
*Armageddon huuuuuuugs
<Armageddon> Drake and I
<Armageddon> have been talking non-stop
<Armageddon> about the mercenary thing for several days
<Drake> 04hi
<Armageddon> DRAKE
*Armageddon hugs
*Drake hugs back
<Drake> 04was playing BF3
<Drake> 04and I despise it
<Drake> 04a lot
<Drake> 04I mean
<Drake> 04I see an enemy
<Drake> 04"Oh look I better- oh no, I'm dead and he didn't fire a shot. Just my luck."
<Armageddon> lmao
*Armageddon hugs Drake
<Armageddon> anyway
<Drake> 04It's bullshit
<Armageddon> >:
*Armageddon hugs
<Drake> 04I used to get 12 K/8 Deaths
<Drake> 04But now I'm, for some reason, up against 12 Prestige players
<Armageddon> Ah
<Drake> 04Which means they've completed the ranking system 12 times
<Armageddon> .-.
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> good luck
<Armageddon> can't help you there
<Espeon|School> wait
<Espeon|School> does battlanfield have
<Espeon|School> prestiges
<Drake> 04apparently
<Drake> 04I asked my friend about it
<Drake> 04I downloaded the DLC to try and get this better rifle, but I can't even unlock it
<Armageddon> o_O
<Drake> 04Because I can't kill anyone
<Drake> 04Because it's a Lance Corporal going up against 12 Prestige people
<Espeon|School> Famas? It seems like that gun can't be in any game without being stupidly strong.
<Espeon|School> except bf2
<Armageddon> and bf3
<Drake> 04I can't get he Famas
<Drake> 04the
<Armageddon> anywaaaaaaaaaay Drake, we've established what happens in the first mission
<Armageddon> second mission?
<Drake> 04I suck at everything in the game
<Espeon|School> And in every game I've seen level does not always reflect skill at all. Except those with actually good level systems.
<Espeon|School> And aw
<Armageddon> and is the first mission in daytime or night?
<Drake> 04Night
<Armageddon> it makes more sense at daytime
<Drake> 04Alright then
<Armageddon> I just envisioned it that way for some reason
<Drake> 04And NS, you still need a rival jet fighter
<Armageddon> Rhy'll get one later
<Armageddon> She'll still crap up his ass though
<Drake> 04Will the guy's grudge be personal or professional?
<Espeon|School> 06<Drake> And NS, you still need a rival jet fighter
<Espeon|School> 06ACE COMBAT.jpg
<Drake> 04Espeon
<Espeon|School> 06:3
<Drake> 04Where do you think all this inspiration is coming from LOL
<Drake> 04I've been downloading Ace Combat music non-stop
<Espeon|School> 06Exactry
<Drake> 04It's got some insanely good tracks
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> <Drake> Will the guy's grudge be personal or professional?
<Armageddon> I doubt it'd be personal
<Armageddon> professional
<Drake> 04Aww 'kay
<Drake> 04So
<Drake> 04"YOU BEAT MY RECORD! FUCK YOU!?
<Drake> 04Or something similar
<Armageddon> yeah lmfao
<Armageddon> personal
<Armageddon> would be waaaay too coincidental
<Drake> 04Fair enough
<Drake> 04Well
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> I'd more over say that he's impressed
<Armageddon> and wants to beat her
<Drake> 04Considering Rhy becomes the Demon of Singapore/insertcityhere and shoots down quite a few planes I don't think it's that coincidental
<Drake> 04fair enough
<Armageddon> yeah
<Espeon|School> 06So pretty much hunting the glory or whatever for taking her down
<Espeon|School> 06makes sense
<Espeon|School> 06and not sarcastic either aa
<Drake> 04Dem pilots have a lot of rivalry between the,
<Armageddon> when Rhy first gets attacked
<Drake> 04them*
<Drake> 04she's like
<Drake> 04"FUCK HOW DO I FIRE THE MISSILES"
*Drake runs
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> she's like
<Armageddon> "NATHAAAAAAAAAAN GET THIS BASTARD OFF MY TAIL!!!!!!!"
<Drake> 04Then Nathan OHKOs with the sniper rifle from the ground. Hell yes.
<Drake> 04No not really XD
<Drake> 04If anything, we'd save that kind of stunt for the climax.
<Drake> 04"Nathan, I'm on fire here, and I've still got a tango on my tail!"
<Drake> 04"Can you get him close?"
<Drake> 04"Yeah but...what are you planning?"
<Drake> 04"Get him over here, up close. I've got a plan."
<Armageddon> he uses a bazooka
<Armageddon> or rocket launcher
<Drake> 04Sniper rifle to the cockpit.
<Drake> 04Bad
<Drake> 04ass
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> imo Rhy should shoot him down
<Armageddon> at the end
<Armageddon> not Nathan
<Drake> 04I never said it was Rhy's rival
<Armageddon> since it's her archnemesis essentially
<Armageddon> you said
<Armageddon> Rhy needs a rival
<Drake> 04It could have just been Rhy was out of missiles, damaged, and unable to take down this last tango
<Drake> 04Meaning
<Armageddon> well that could be a diff guy
<Drake> 04she's already shot her nemesis down
<Armageddon> but her rival
<Armageddon> should be shot down by her nemesis
<Drake> 04And some other guy gets her tail
<Armageddon> alright
<Armageddon> that makes more sense
<Drake> 04It's not going to be 1v1 the whole climax
<Armageddon> yeah of course not
<Armageddon> And fuck yeah
<Armageddon> [20:24:11] <Drake> she's like
<Armageddon> [20:24:17] <Drake> "FUCK HOW DO I FIRE THE MISSILES"
<Armageddon> when she first gets in the jet
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Leo
<Drake> 04Leo's about to tell her and the instructor is like "NO SHUT THE FUCK UP"
<Armageddon> She'll be like
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> then she accidentally blows something up
<Drake> 04The instructor just glares at Leo afterwards.
<Armageddon> Leo smirks
<Armageddon> and then shows Rhy how to use it
<Armageddon> Nathan'll just be like "oh snap owned"
<Drake> 04Of course Nathan will. He's the deadpan smartass of the trio.
<Armageddon> duh
<Armageddon> Anyway Drake
<Armageddon> we need a mission set in a Shadow Moses Island-like area
<Armageddon> dark, metal walls, etc.
<Armageddon> like the front cover of Battleship, Drake :D
<Drake> 04Second mission. After the success of their first operation, four months afterwards Rhy, Nathan and Leonard are to take part in a lone-team operation along the coast of Japan - The United States have hired the services of Indie to sabotage the Japanese Naval Base on the east coast.
*Drake shrugs
<Armageddon> Hm
<Drake> 04Indie being the CEO of the entire corporation
<Drake> 04Still don't have a name for the corporation as a whole though
<Armageddon> yeah
<Drake> 04An offshoot of Zastava?
<Armageddon> or story name
<Armageddon> lolwut
<Espeon|School> 06<~Armageddon> we need a mission set in a Shadow Moses Island-like area <- +1 to you just because
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zastava_Arms
<Drake> 04Maybe not
<Drake> 04It's Serbian
<Drake> 04Xeli i saw that TF2 topic on TST finally and now I'm playing TF2
<Drake> 04curses
<Armageddon> you fail
<Armageddon> and nawwwwwwwwww
<Armageddon> Drake, where's the main base?
<Armageddon> Canada's a bit of a strange place
<Espeon|School> 06Yay drake
<Armageddon> but I imagine it'll be their "home" in a sort of way
<Armageddon> And Rhy'll be complaining about the cold
<Drake> 04Canada isn't where the HQ is
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> HQ is in US then?
<Drake> 04It's just where we've been allocated living quarters
<Armageddon> actually that makes no sense
<Drake> 04Sure.
<Armageddon> not US
<Armageddon> Afghanistan?
<Armageddon> or Russia, Drake? idk
<Drake> 04Russia
<Drake> 04Russia
<Drake> 04YES
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04Then I can have a girl named Esther
*Drake loves that name
<Armageddon> ...you're going to get Rhy pregnant?
<Espeon|School> 06what
<Drake> 04fuck no
*Drake slaps NS
<Drake> 04I meant
<Drake> 04so the story can have a character named Esther
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04Maybe Indie's right-hand-woman
<Armageddon> sure
<Armageddon> Rhy hates her
<Armageddon> Nathan swoons over her
<Armageddon> Rhy bitchslaps him
<Drake> 04Sweet
<Armageddon> and eventually kills her
<Drake> 04Esther is Indie's daughter
<Armageddon> Alright
<Armageddon> Well
<Armageddon> we'll say that Rhy hates her while Nathan thinks she's pretty
<Drake> 04yay sexual tension
<Armageddon> She's a conceited and arrogant bitch
<Armageddon> quite cold-hearted and merciless
<Drake> 04I was imagining something more along the lines of a femme fatale, shy, but cold and merciless
<Drake> 04Which is why Indie warns Nathan to stay away from her.
<Drake> 04That causes a bit of tension between Rhy and Nathan later on
<Armageddon> Well
<Drake> 04Then after 3/4 the way through the story, Nathan's like "Fuck that bitch"
<Armageddon> Rhy definitely will wind up killing her
<Armageddon> 2/3
<Armageddon> 3/4's a bit too close to the end
<Armageddon> <Drake> Which is why Indie warns Nathan to stay away from her.
<Drake> 04Indie sends Esther to kill Rhy, Nathan and Leo after they're branded rogues and Rhy kills her?
<Armageddon> what sort of person is Indie anyway?
<Armageddon> Yeah
<Drake> 04Imagine...hmm
<Drake> 04What's the character I'm looking for...
<Armageddon> That ga-whatever person
<Armageddon> from VCS?
<Drake> 04no
<Drake> 04no way
<Drake> 04The Shadow Lord/Giovanni/Slade
<Armageddon> I'd go for Giovanni
<Drake> 04The Shadow Lord's meticulous planning, Givanni's style, and SLade's personality.
<Armageddon> Slade's personality wouldn't suit a mercenary organization
<Armageddon> it's more like Giovanni's personality
<Drake> 04Alright then
<Armageddon> I see
<Drake> 04I'm so much better at TF2 than I am BF3
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> well anyway Drake
<Armageddon> Shadow Moses Island setting :D
<Armageddon> MUST HAVE
<Drake> 04That's why i mentioned the Japanese Naval Base
<Drake> 04perfect SM setting
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04Also
<Drake> 04NS
<Armageddon> ?
<Drake> 04What city has a lot of towers?
<Drake> 04Not just really tall ones
<Armageddon> ...sydney?
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04Like, a lot of towersthroughout the city.
<Armageddon> New York?
<Armageddon> London?
<Armageddon> Antarctica?
<Drake> 04London
<Drake> 04nah
<Drake> 04New York is too overused
<Drake> 04Chicago?
<Armageddon> Hm, Drake
*Armageddon has a look
<Armageddon> Dubai?
<Drake> 04Oooh
<Armageddon> http://goitaly.about.com/od/sangimignano/p/sangimignano.htm
<Armageddon> hehe
<Drake> 04Aerial combat in the towers of Dubai, while Leo and Nathan rappel down a tower
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Espeon|School> 06stop that internet
<Drake> 04:O
<Drake> 04Aww man
<Drake> 04Drone jam
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> [20:54:49] <~Armageddon> http://goitaly.about.com/od/sangimignano/p/sangimignano.htm
<Armageddon> [20:54:50] <~Armageddon> hehe
<Armageddon> [20:55:03] <Drake> Aerial combat in the towers of Dubai, while Leo and Nathan rappel down a tower
<Armageddon> [20:55:06] <~Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> check that link Drake
<Armageddon> MEDIEVAL WALLS
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04We need to go there
<Armageddon> yes
<Drake> 04SCOOT
<Drake> 04That was fun
<Espeon|School> 06:3
<Espeon|School> 06brb i need foooodss
<Drake> 04k
<Armageddon> XD
*Armageddon hugs Drake
*Armageddon hugs Xeli too
*Drake hugs back
*Espeon|School hugs both. Somehow
<Drake> 04Magic
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> GROUP HUGS
<Armageddon> Anyway Drake
<Armageddon> we need to go to that place in italy
<Armageddon> OR
<Armageddon> Versailles
<Armageddon> WE SHOULD GO THERE
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04Why?
<Armageddon> because
<Armageddon> WALLS
<Espeon|School> 06whut
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04:I
<Armageddon> :U
*Armageddon hugs Drake and Xeli
*Drake hugs back
<Drake> 04Anyway
<Drake> 04What should happen between the first and second mission?
<Drake> 04I want most character development to happen in those interims.
<Espeon|School> 06hm
<Armageddon> Rhy, Nathan and Leonard going to the beach.
<Armageddon> And Leo refusing to get in.
<Armageddon> So then Rhy and Nathan drag him in and he threatens to shoot them
<Espeon|School> 06and now I imagine that thank you
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I guess they'd be happy after their first successful mission.
<Armageddon> Yeah
<Espeon|School> 06Nathan should totally get rather /bothered/ by thinking of the fact they are killing people at some point. Yay psychology.
<Espeon|School> 06But yeah.
<Armageddon> Nathan does get bothered
<Armageddon> especially when he has to kill
<Armageddon> Rhy on the other hand
<Armageddon> isn't really bothered
<Armageddon> or as much
<Drake> 04It's after the second or third mission that Nathan really starts getting disturbed by the lives he is taking.
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> he doesn't kill until the 2nd or 3rd mission
<Espeon|School> 06And Leo has pretty much learned to cope with it .. decently at least.
<Drake> 04Especially when he is forced to use a .50 cal to save a fellow mercenary.
<Espeon|School> 06So yeah.
<Armageddon> Well
<Armageddon> Leo's been in the company for at least 3 years
<Armageddon> before he found Rhy and Nathan
<Drake> 04yeah
<Armageddon> so he's pretty used to it
<Drake> 04But using a .50 on a person is overkill x10
<Drake> 04Which is why Nathan ends up so disturbed
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> Rhy doesn't really care I suppose
<Armageddon> Since she gets over it
<Drake> 04She's like "We need to do this, so we might as well do it with as little emotional strain as possible"
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> Rhy's a sort of "I'll do what must be done" sort of person
<Armageddon> aka kill or be killed
<Armageddon> sorta like Kommander Kulesz/The Hensh
<Armageddon> except they're more philosophically based
<Armageddon> so derp
<Drake> 04Whereas Nathan is constantly thinking of the emotional and philosiphical implications of what he does
<Drake> 04Why he survives when the people he has to kill don't, whether they might have had families etc.
<Armageddon> That's not philosophical
<Armageddon> that's the "if"s
<Armageddon> which are not worth thinking about
<Armageddon> which Rhy constantly tells him
<Drake> 04But Nathan can't help but keep thinking of it because he's such a pussy and all
*Drake shot
<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04But nah, he's just a generally more thoughtful person than Rhy, which is why it takes her verbally beating him senseless to make him understand.
<Armageddon> Yeah
<Armageddon> and why she's developed a habit of doing that to everyone
<Armageddon> because she lives around Nathan
<Armageddon> makes sense
<Armageddon> :D
<Espeon|School> 06So does this mean
<Espeon|School> 06Rhy is the dominant one in this relationship?
*Espeon|School hides
<Drake> 04of course
<Drake> 04Just like NS and I
*Drake runs
<Armageddon> lmao
<Espeon|School> 06:3
<Armageddon> :o
<Armageddon> But yeah Drake
<Drake> 04yeah
<Armageddon> yeah well
<Armageddon> in between we don't need too much detail
<Armageddon> most chapters will just jump from mission to mission
<Drake> 04I'd rather not
<Drake> 04A few chapters per interim
<Armageddon> well Drake
<Drake> 04Then like, 7 chapters per mission
<Armageddon> well I meant that
<Armageddon> most of the things we describe
<Armageddon> will just be missions
<Armageddon> not the inbetween stuff
<Drake> 04Again
<Drake> 04most character development will be in the interims
<Drake> 04but alright
<Armageddon> character dev will mostly be in training
<Armageddon> and some interims
<Armageddon> we're not going to have an interim after EVERY mission
<Drake> 04Yes we are >:|
<Drake> 04And no, character dev won't be mostly in training
<Drake> 04we are not having static characters throughout it.
<Drake> 04Since most of the questionable activity will be happening during the missions, the interims give us a chance to expand upon the character's thoughts and feelings.
<Armageddon> of course not idiot
<Drake> 04Which, IMO is the most important part of a story
<Armageddon> but most of the changes from kid to almost-mercenary will begin in training
<Drake> 04Obviously
<Armageddon> and then psychological changes begin in missions
<Drake> 04But that's not character development
<Armageddon> or at least half of it
<Drake> 04That's physical change
<Armageddon> psychological you idiot
<Armageddon> not physical
*Drake facepalms
<Armageddon> you know, emotional, philosophical, etc.?
<Drake> 04Physical change will happen in training
<Drake> 04No one's morals will change during training
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04Training doesn't have the impact of watching a bullet go straight through someone
<Armageddon> they're being taught how to handle guns
<Drake> 04Anyway
<Drake> 04I need to go
<Armageddon> and weapons
<Drake> 04Bed now
<Armageddon> and how to kill people
<Armageddon> etc.
*Drake hugs NS and Xeli
<Armageddon> I'm pretty sure
<Drake> 04So?
<Armageddon> that will change people
<Drake> 04They're kids
<Drake> 04They're naive
<Armageddon> Yes
<Drake> 04Of course they change
<Armageddon> they're 15
<Armageddon> like us
<Drake> 04But they don't become killers or hardened mercenaries
<Armageddon> by then our morals are pretty set in stone
<Drake> 04fuck
<Drake> 04I have to go
<Drake> 04bye
<Armageddon> :\
*Armageddon hu-

<Meanwhile> The game itself will be a lot longer than 3 hours Ingwaz, and suitably more epic. Besides, why work out all the personal hype on a demo when I can just wait for the whole thing to drool on.
<SadLawnchair> Don't know any more

<LadyCanary> Just got here.
<emangamer> SadLawnchair: :( *hugs*

*LadyCanary hugs the Lawnchair.
<Meanwhile> Ingwaz: I like to try things out in the field, explore everything, I got a handle on the classes in the first 2 games and frankly, everything is better when you're unprepared for it.
<Meanwhile> Which is why I put beetles in your sandwich.
<rainbro> Cmon lawnchair. You're obviously begging for attention.

<TOY_PON3> Who...said friendzoned...?
<TOY_PON3> :|
<Ingwaz> perhaps Meanwhile, but this is only a small taste of the actual game, its to get hype for the game going again, and to prove that hey, they didnt screw up, its still awesome
<Meanwhile> SadLawnchair said friendzoned because he got friendzoned. He is in the zone of friends TOY_PON3 are you happy now.
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<TOY_PON3> SadLawnchair: I'm...sorry..
<[SWAG]Haku> Dont be dude
<[SWAG]Haku> You have nothing to be sorry about
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: Aaand thank you for answering my question -.-

<TOY_PON3> SadLawnchair: Maybe that will help.
<rainbro> Please stop with the links.
<Polydunami> TOY_PON3: Same here
<emangamer> I didn't really get friendzoned. I knew I was there and went for it anyway. All I got in return was "I'm sorry"
<otakon> fillyfillyy: just search youtube
<Morty> wanna know whats better than the italian opening? The german opening http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc&list=PLDF1B4C469E6308E9&index=21&feature=plpp_video

<MahBoi777> Everlasting_Joy: rough day?
*Polydunami is PONYdunami
<flutterSpin> I just like watching people react to MLP, the same way I do while watching it.
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777 nope, one of the better ones.
<mario_pony> OMFG The_4th_Wall has NEVER played a mario game!!!!
<flutterSpin> Makes things more enjoyable
<The_4th_Wall> Pinkie Pie is the cure for Diabeetus
<Polydunami> WHAT!?
<MahBoi777> good good
<Polydunami> Pinkie Pie?
<The_4th_Wall> yup
<fillyfillyy> indubitively The_4th_Wall
<Everlasting_Joy> The_4th_Wall She is the cause of diabeetus.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Whats up, guys!
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: bronyism always helps. its always good to know that you've joined quite the extended family, and that that family genuinely cares about each other for the most part
<Everlasting_Joy> about half of it I should say.
<fillyfillyy> I R fancy!?!
<Spectre> now i'm listening to 8 bit versions of all the songs thanks moop
<The_4th_Wall> Trust me. It works out.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Scoot-Scootaloo.

<LadyCanary> Thank you Scoot-Scootaloo <3
*Everlasting_Joy hugs fillyfillyy.
<flutterSpin> Valentines Day? You mean like any other ordinary day?
<Phase4> ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
*Polydunami glomps Spectre :D
<The_4th_Wall> If you give the cure the cancer she cures,they cancel out.
<Phase4> its valentines day?
<Spectre> glomps?
<MahBoi777> forever aloooooone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I am seeing someone for depression issues, and he's helped defeat them (w/o meds). BronyState has giving me things to do for you all here and for me.
<The_4th_Wall> No need for a cure. NO cancer
<Everlasting_Joy> Scoot-Scootaloo I'm forever alone, but I've learned to take joy in it in some aspects.
<flutterSpin> What is that from anyways? "Forever Alone" Been looking for the origin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm pretty much the happiest I've been in years.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<MahBoi777> thanks Scoot-Scootaloo, you too
<Polydunami> A glomp is a combination of tackle and hug
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01From having friends and managing stress.
<Everlasting_Joy> flutterSpin http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/forever-alone
<moop> Nittany_Discord: i technically have clinical depression
<The_4th_Wall> Cancer is not the focus anymore; We don't need to cure what's not there
<Purple`Prose> A glomp is a hug at speed
*emangamer hugs Nittany_Discord
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Can I share soemthing with you guys? Since this seems like the appropriate moment?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs emangamer
<moop> but i'm never sad
<Ingwaz> well Nittany_Discord, i know some take it as hollow words, but i think that generally, if one ouf us needed help getting through something, the others would be their for them
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: I will always be your friend. No matter what <3
<flutterSpin> Got a guy at work who refuses to watch tv or play games. What does he do instead? Flurt.
<Ingwaz> Scoot-Scootaloo: you're secretly a chicken?
<The_4th_Wall> Let us never speak of that again
<Purple`Prose> Scoot-Scootaloo: Sure
<Ingwaz> we already knew that
<Everlasting_Joy> Shoot Scoot-Scootaloo.
<MahBoi777> yes
<Polydunami> Spit it out ^__^
<MahBoi777> do tell
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ingwaz :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No this is SRS
<Kirakishou> 03aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Ingwaz> sorry, it was too good to pass up
<moop> okay
<Armageddon> Sneas :o
<emangamer> Scoot-Scootaloo: I know. I love you too, you dont have to say it
*The_4th_Wall sits down
<MahBoi777> SRSLY SRS?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03A year ago, I managed to attempt to ask out my ol' friend.
<flutterSpin> bah. Forever Alone is another weird 4chan type thing? eh.
<The_4th_Wall> For SRYL
<MahBoi777> uh-huh?
<emangamer> oh dear...this will either end really well or really poorly
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03She was exactly like me, and we knew we liked each other.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03inb4 pity btw
<moop> uh oh
<emangamer> Scoot-Scootaloo: foreverapitty
<MahBoi777> I see, please go on
<Polydunami> This is getting unsettling
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Anyway, as I walked toward her, she looked back, and started walking faster.
<emangamer> and then the chat waited, in hushed silence for Scoot-Scootaloo to finish his story
<flutterSpin> lol
<Spectre> :D
<flutterSpin> Then a car ran you over?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I was confused, so I called out her name.
<MahBoi777> yes?
<Polydunami> Oh great
<Spectre> "Ted, HEY TED!"
<Spectre> ...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03She just said "leave me alone".
<MahBoi777> Sheila come back!! I made you muffins!
<Phase4> ow
<The_4th_Wall> :(
*fillyfillyy needs stream!!
<MahBoi777> ouch
<emangamer> :'(
*mario_pony cries
<flutterSpin> Ever figure out why?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I didn't know what happened to her. 
<emangamer> wah.....
<emangamer> thats terrible
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I never found out why.
<SilverSonic> lmao
<MahBoi777> Men, we don't know what we did
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It was exactly a year ago.
<Spectre> Forever
<Spectre> Alone
<Armageddon> hm
<moop> I never found out why my gym teacher hates brownies
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03When that happened, that is.
<flutterSpin> Love triangle, fear of commitment, or some other business huh
<The_4th_Wall> Ouch. That can't help
<Everlasting_Joy> Ouch :'(.
<Ingwaz> thats really odd Scoot-Scootaloo...i'm surprised you didnt pursue her further to find out
<emangamer> Scoot-Scootaloo: Dont worry, we will always love you (physically)
<MahBoi777> srry to hear that ,am
<MahBoi777> *man
<MahBoi777> emangamer: LOL
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So for the next couple of months, I was a cynical bastard. I was still confused
<flutterSpin> Let you know, my personality is Twilight and I would like to marry a Fluttershy
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sad, and just apathetic
<Everlasting_Joy> You guys realize how tight we are, here in this chat?
*emangamer is still a cynical bastard
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And then on June, I started watchin MLP FiM
<otakon> and you felt BETTER
<otakon> yes?
<MahBoi777> Huzzah!
<Spectre> who wuldn't?
<moop> Scoot-Scootaloo: In every life we have some troble but when you worry you make it double dont worry, be happy.
<otakon> I'll be honest
<flutterSpin> the love has do... too soon?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03lol, I guess you can say that!
<Polydunami> Dang, moop
<Spectre> i started watching after seeing Apple.mov
<otakon> if it wasn't for MLP I would probably be in a deep funk atm
*Midnight_Tempest feels good and clean after his shower, then bursts into flames
<MahBoi777> moop: I hear a song coming on, lol
<Polydunami> :D
<Lawnchair> Where the streams at.
<flutterSpin> There is no stream?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Guys, I have to be honest, if it weren't for MLP and people like you guys, I would be a depressed mofo.
<Polydunami> I was reminded of Team Rocket, moop :D
<Spectre> your not the only one
<fillyfillyy> lol Midnight_Tempest i know the feeling
<The_4th_Wall> no. There's a canal, though
<Everlasting_Joy> Scoot-Scootaloo, you aren't alone in that, know that.
<moop> Polydunami lol
<Everlasting_Joy> Because I'd be in that club with you.
<MahBoi777> I would be depressed too
*The_4th_Wall hugs Scoot-Scootaloo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And thats the story of why I became a brony.
<flutterSpin> I'm still fighting between living with my mom and finding a job so I can move out. I do NOTHING in this house. NOTHING except give her 1/2 of my money
<IshBestPony> You may find yourself asking, where the buck is IshBestPony, and you may find that the answer is right here
<Polydunami> flutterSpin: same here
<Spectre> Hey IshBestPony
<MahBoi777> ohai IshBestPony
<The_4th_Wall> You get a better deal than I, at least.
<Ingwaz> must have been something wrong Scoot-Scootaloo, if you were both friends, makes no sense why she would run away from you
<Ingwaz> something must have happened
<Polydunami> Hello IshBestPony
<flutterSpin> She doesn't even trust me with the mail.
*fillyfillyy tackles IshBestPony and noms on his mane!

<emangamer> inb4 giant fucking text wall
*Scoot-Scootaloo Lonely as I am, together we cry...
<emangamer> Before ponies I didn't have much of a life. The only thing that kept me afloat was being in my schools drama. Then last semester I couldn't make drama due to schedule conflicts. So for a majority of that semester I sat at home on my computer all day and did nothing. I had no social life what so ever. Then I found ponies. Now, this semester, I'm still not in drama but I dont care. Despite not going outside to hang with
<IshBestPony> fillyfillyy since you hate valentines day, will you be mai valentine*trollface*
<fillyfillyy> yes
*fillyfillyy hugs
<Ingwaz> a little something adorable to lighten things up

*Scoot-Scootaloo hugs emangamer
<Polydunami> That is SO CUTE
<Polydunami> OH MY GOD
*fillyfillyy hugs emangamer
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I think its safe to say we all know what it feels like to be isolated
<emangamer> inb4 except ME
<IshBestPony> sorry fillyfillyy, I have to deny ur valentine request
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Lost, forgotten, abandoned...
<Polydunami> I love my friends
<MahBoi777> United
<Polydunami> In real life too
<fillyfillyy> noooo!!!!! WHY!
<fillyfillyy> ... ok
<mario_pony> i remember our brake up it was on v-day.
<Ingwaz> aye, i went through a pretty rough period when i was younger too, kids can be really cruel, i'm sure we all know that
<IshBestPony> cuz I haz trollface on right nao
<Everlasting_Joy> I've got something to tell all y'all who feel isolated from society.
<Ingwaz> go out and do something?
<Spectre> lol
<Polydunami> I've had major crushes throughout high school and a few years after
<Everlasting_Joy> Ingwaz Hell no!
<Everlasting_Joy> Consider why you are isolated.
<Ingwaz> stay home, watch ponies, get pissed runk?
<emangamer> I have felt isolated since i moved to texas in 6th grade....I fucking hate texas because of it
<Ingwaz> drunk*
<IshBestPony> bai everpony
<MahBoi777> Ingwaz: that's crazy talk! the outside buuuurns! jk
<Polydunami> The last crush I had was a major downer
<Everlasting_Joy> You are probably isolated because you just don't fit into society, and guess what, that's just fine!
<Spectre> Ingwaz: same but get high
<MahBoi777> bye IshBestPony
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care IshBestPony.
<flutterSpin> I started watching MLP because I was curious. I liked it ^^ . But :( Even my brother thinks Phineas and Ferb is stupid.
<Polydunami> I got sent a rejection message on facebook last June
*IshBestPony hugz and nomz MahBoi777 and Everlasting_Joy
<Ingwaz> well Everlasting_Joy, i'm somewhat isolated because #1 i prefer a bit of solitude, #2 i live in a small town and theres nothing to do here, #3 i cant stay out and about too much due to my school and family duties and #4 even in town, theres not much to do anyway
<Spectre> i tried showing my bro and one of my friends and nothing phased them
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey! That is my mane IshBestPony, do you know how dirty it is?
<otakon> I live in the middle of bumbuck nowhere
<otakon> and I'm a hermit
<MahBoi777> I like being alone, it's quiet, lol
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So much heartfelt talk in here...
<Everlasting_Joy> Let me finish my speech folks.
<Polydunami> Ever since, I've been very cautious about falling in love with anyone
*emangamer snuggles with otakon inside of his shell
<otakon> hold on!
<TopHat> Machismo <-- Funny word
*IshBestPony shows Everlasting_Joy his Trollface "U Mad"
<otakon> I don't snuggle emangamer! I'll hug ya though.
<Armageddon> heya Kaslai
<emangamer> SuperBrony64: I enjoyed your very inspiring talk over skype, I never thanked you for that
*otakon hugs emangamer
<MahBoi777> same here otakon
<Ingwaz> SuperBrony64: we're bronies, and that means we're family
*emangamer snuggles with otakon regardless
<Everlasting_Joy> Consider what it take to "fit into" society, it would mean abandoning your very identiy.
<Kaslai> Hello.
*otakon sighs "Fine....."
<Everlasting_Joy> Which is a crime as bad as murder.
<flutterSpin> BROHOOF
<mario_pony> she told me we could still be friends i told her she was a b***h and to f**k off.
<Lawnchair> Wheere the strams at.
<fillyfillyy> firefox crashed :(
<Polydunami> I'm not going to fit into society. I am my own person ^__^
<Ingwaz> i havent even been coming to brony state for that long, month and a half maybe? I was a bit apprehensive about having to fit in with a new group that was already well established
<MahBoi777> SuperBrony64, care to add something to the conversation? lol
<Spectre> I wish i had a another brony around me to hang with
<Ingwaz> yet i was pretty much immediately accepted
<otakon> not on atm and HI Lawnchair how are you my friend?
<flutterSpin> One day I will find my cutie mark!
<Mutterguy> what Crazy mayhem have i missed?
<Polydunami> I have a few brony friends myself
<The_4th_Wall> Mee, too
<Polydunami> irl
<Lawnchair> Not very well, otakon
<Ingwaz> that was my early brony days, showed me part of what it means to really be a brony
<Lawnchair> Friendzone shenanagins got me down, and whatnot.
<TopHat> http://www.rainymood.com/ Let's all listen to this at the same time
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm a very isolated person because when I see the stupidity and atrocities of society, I can't help but grow disgusted.
<mario_pony> haven't talked to her ever since.
<flutterSpin> what the?
<Polydunami> I love stormy weather
<MahBoi777> I converted only one of my friends, and he gets on here almost every day.
<Armageddon> how's it going?
<emangamer> I honestally dont know what my cutie mark would be. I'm not really good at anything particular.... it sucks being mediocer at everything
<Ingwaz> i know how that is a bit Everlasting_Joy, i'm a fairly analytical person so i see a lot of what is wrong with the world and it does bother me sometimes
<mario_pony> i wish we were still together.:(
<Polydunami> One year in Vancouver, there was a lightning storm that coincided with the annual fireworks show that summer
<otakon> Lawnchair: I'm sorry to hear that, but don't worry my friend. You'll find someone as long as you just keep looking and don't lose hope.
<Ingwaz> the saying ignorance is bliss is very true
<Spectre> i love sitting on my back porch and watch the rain and/or storm just go by...wind feels good and sound is enticing...
<emangamer> Ingwaz: I know...it really is
<flutterSpin> Jack of all trades, master of none... or no one cares to use you for
<otakon> I have kind of accepted my forever alone status....
<Ingwaz> i have spent literal months at a time just thinking thinking thinking about everything wrong with the world, so much mental stress
<Spectre> otakon: Same here man...
<otakon> Ingwaz: good way to drive yourself mad if you want to do it
<otakon> okay, brb need MOAR COFFEE!
<Everlasting_Joy> Ingwaz, I'm a very analytical person, so to see this repulsive stuff has made me grown very disdain of the outside world.
<Spectre> one thing i have always said you save money :D
<Polydunami> I'm not much of a worrywort, to be honest
*TOY_PON32 slowly wakes up and looks around
<TOY_PON32> Hey guys.
<MahBoi777> hey TOY_PON32
<Polydunami> Hello TOY_PON32
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey TOY_PON32.
<Spectre> Hey TOY_PON3
<Mutterguy> Hai
<Ingwaz> otakon: thats something about myself i already know, i'm not a mentally stable person, i regularly have to keep myself in check and it has taken literal years to do so.
<fillyfillyy> hi TOY_PON32
<TOY_PON32> I feel better now
<flutterSpin> Hey TOM_P... I mean TOY_PON32
<MahBoi777> good!
<Ingwaz> sometimes my "bloodlust" as i refer to it, can get really high
<emangamer> The worst nights are where you just lie awake thinking about how much you suck and how many thing you have done wrong
*fillyfillyy tackle hugs TOY_PON32 you are happy now!!
<Spectre> ouch...
<MahBoi777> HUZZAH!
<fillyfillyy> the fun has been doubled!
*TOY_PON32 huts fillyfillyy back
<Polydunami> ^
<TOY_PON32> Yup
<MahBoi777> lol
<Everlasting_Joy> emangamer oh yeah, those are the worst, especially if you don't take to shame well.
<Ingwaz> emangamer: i've developed a little trick for that actually, as i'm frequently revisted by unpleasant memories, every time one comes up, clap your hands in front of your face, do so swiftly, the sound should startle you and snap you out of it
<TOY_PON32> brb though, dinner
<Polydunami> I don't really have any reason to be ashamed of my life
<MahBoi777> DINNER
<Polydunami> I just want to move on
<Spectre> Damn...you all are describing me...
<mario_pony> emangamer: yeah i sometimes start crying
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777 Dinner.
<MahBoi777> xD
<Spectre> ok maybe not cry about it
<fillyfillyy> ok have...fun?
<flutterSpin> Is it ... wait, what was I hoping it to be time for?
<Everlasting_Joy> Spectre it's o.k. to cry in this fanbase.
<RackishTilt> aye
<Spectre> the only thing to make me cry "manly" tears is My Little Dashie
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03*
<Ingwaz> indeed, the world says emotions are a sign of weakness, theyre wrong. emotions are strength, to reject them is weakness
<flutterSpin> I still refuse to read it
<Everlasting_Joy> Spectre, still, you can cry in this fanbase.
<TOY_PON32> ^
<fillyfillyy> so who else is going to be alone tommorow?
<Spectre> ok...:'(
<fillyfillyy> leik me
<MahBoi777> when I get depressed, I think about all the good things the have happened, bad things should stay in the past. I used to live in the past alot
<Spectre> ME!
<Everlasting_Joy> fillyfillyy me.
<emangamer> I kind of will.....
<Ingwaz> fillyfillyy: you've got us so you dont have to be alone
<emangamer> IDK
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03meh...
<fillyfillyy> http://www.atlfades.net/lounge/src/129774233521.png this cheered me up
<Polydunami> That's it. I'm pulling out the stops on this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1O0ErRhdoI
<RackishTilt> no one in this fandom is really ever alone
<Mutterguy> my Little Dashie needs to be made into a film so the Whole world will cry
<Lawnchair> Soemoen should stream.
*emangamer will be Scoot-Scootaloo's special sompony
<TOY_PON32> Nope :3
<flutterSpin> And I thought I was the only one that things deep
<Spectre> I'm going to spend my valentine's day with my x...
<Lawnchair> Ha ha, 'And that Guy.'
<Spectre> box 360 HAHA!
<Flair> Shizuka?
<fillyfillyy> eeyup... i am that guy :P
<Ingwaz> me too spectre, you getting mass effect 3?
<Shizuka> 13ohai
<emangamer> Ohai Shizuka
<Flair> First off
<Spectre> haven'tplayed any of them yet
<emangamer> will YOU have a special somepony toomorrow
*Flair huggles Shizuka
<Spectre> so idk yet
<Flair> Secondly
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Flair> Natleyn or Flaria for username for Tribes?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03hey Shizuka! You also missed my life story!
<Shizuka> 13hmmmmm
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Shizuka.
<Shizuka> 13i saw scoot~
<Shizuka> 13flip a coin <3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03oh...
<Polydunami> Also, afaik, I'm going to be alone on Valentine's Day
<Ingwaz> i was actually going to give a completely platonic valentine to a pegasister tomorrow, but my only class got cancelled so now i cant
<Mutterguy> oh right, It's today for me.
<Polydunami> And I'm quite happy
<Flair> Shizuka: Okay <3
*TOY_PON32 missed Scoot-Scootaloo's life story :(
<Mutterguy> not that anything happened
<MahBoi777> hello Lawnchair
<Spectre> Ingwaz: That's cold...damn school
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03um... tails?
<Polydunami> I'm not interested in anyone at the moment
<Flair> Shizuka: Going with Natleyn :3
<flutterSpin> "Rainy Mood Loves You" hahaha just noticed that
<Ingwaz> i suppose i'm weird in the relationship department, i see a lot of people, many of them perfectly good looking people. yet i do not find them attractive at all, at least not physically
<Polydunami> ^
<Ingwaz> i'm usually the type to go for mental and personalty over phsyical
<TOY_PON32> I got a friend I'm going with so it's all good. Not looking for love right now
<flutterSpin> Anyone see Oh My Goddess? Yeah...
<Polydunami> Oh Goodness
<mario_pony> theres this girl in my 4th period shes shy and doesn't talk much i like her but i am too ashamed to tell her how i feel.
<Spectre> Just do it
<MahBoi777> hi Shizuka
<Polydunami> DO IT
<Mutterguy> flutterSpin, I have actually
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I read courage wolf pictures to get me going!
<TOY_PON32> brb
<TOY_PON32> :D
<Polydunami> ok
<flutterSpin> I guess its funny that I like Fluttershy the best
<Polydunami> I'm weird
<Polydunami> I like Rarity the best
<flutterSpin> Rarity always surprises me
<RackishTilt> mario_pony: what do you think is the biggest obstacle to talking to this girl? is it what might result or what you fear might result?
<Polydunami> Yep
<Spectre> Applejack = Best
<flutterSpin> Definitely the most complex.
<Everlasting_Joy> Can I put something in perspective for everyone? Here we are sharing deep, painful, shameful, and overall sad emotions to complete strangers, yet all of us are on a "it doesn't leave this room" basis.
<Everlasting_Joy> You wonder why I love this fandom?
<flutterSpin> Sadly, I would find Applejack ... intimidating?
<mario_pony> but she talks to my ex and she probably told her about our breakup.
<Polydunami> Rarity kind of grew on me; I did not like her at first
<Aircrafter> Because all of us are bosses....
<Spectre> seems wierd but reminds me of seeing one of farmer's daughters around where i live...
<Ingwaz> mario_pony: its hard working up the courage, i understand, i really do, but think about it this way, you like her right? if you dont do anything about it, you wont get to be with her, guarenteed. If you do give it a shot, you've got a chance, not sure how good the chance is, but its way better then 0% chance. worst case scenario, she says no, you feel like an idiot for a few days, and you move on, best case, she says yes, and tha
<Spectre> HOT DAMN!
<Lawnchair> Squiggletail is an ok pony.
<emangamer> Everlasting_Joy: IDK what you're talking about. I'm printing this up and posting it all over school tomorrow
<flutterSpin> lol
<Everlasting_Joy> emangamer you would :P.
<Mutterguy> because IRC is such a diiferent environment to face to face
<RackishTilt> there's a political angle, its not easy to approach someone your ex has access to
<Polydunami> I've always been wary about telling someone about how I feel about them
<flutterSpin> the one I marry would be my best friend... when I get some friends
<Polydunami> I developed a crush on someone last year and I think it was obvious
<Polydunami> They sent me a rejection message on Facebook
<flutterSpin> nice
<Everlasting_Joy> Ooof.
<RackishTilt> what terms are you on with your ex? that might be the easier path to clear it through them first and then boach the subject with the young lady
<emangamer> Polydunami: preemptive dumpings are the worst (I think)
<flutterSpin> So immature. Post through Facebook, texting, or some indirect method
<mario_pony> RackishTilt: well when we broke off i told her she was a bitch and to fuck off.
<Spectre> i haven't had a single date or even a crush...is that bad?
<Ingwaz> diabetes incoming!!
<Polydunami> I still see her regularly and it really bugs me
<Ingwaz> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_1Va_KCMQbk/Tzmnfjb31iI/AAAAAAAADCI/X2wfrzFyE38/s1600/filly_scratch__s_gift_by_eneha-d4othe5.jpg
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'm more old fashioned and prefer to do things head on!
<Spectre> and im 19
<Polydunami> Every single time
<otakon> back
<otakon> what's up guys?
<Everlasting_Joy> Spectre I'm 22.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Our hopes...
<emangamer> otakon: this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QodrSfsboFk&feature=related
<emangamer> everypony should watch that^
<RackishTilt> can you patch that up? maybe get her to be an ally on this 4th period girl?
<Ingwaz> Everlasting_Joy: i'm 23, I'M A YEAR OLDER THAN YOU!
<Ingwaz> OH SNAP
<Ingwaz> -caps
<Lawnchair> Wub wub wub.
<otakon> lol emangamer
<Everlasting_Joy> Ingwaz :O.
<Mutterguy> no that's vid is just true
*The_4th_Wall gasps
<Polydunami> emangamer: watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mv8QBEXtMs&feature=related
*emangamer starts to make random noises and calls it dubstep
<The_4th_Wall> YOU ARE!
<mario_pony> RackishTilt: not really i haven't talked to her and her friends and family don't let me aproach her.
<The_4th_Wall> I'm 22!
<RackishTilt> Hahah, who has the rocrd for being the elder brony?
<Lawnchair> http://i41.tinypic.com/jq6tl2.jpg Assume the Apperture Science Party Submission Position.
<emangamer> Polydunami: seen better
<flutterSpin> ugh. Dubstep. I very rarely like dubstep. Only if there isn't any vocals, if that is possible
<fillyfillyy> OMG Polydunami...i was watching this earlier today and was thinking about sharing with everypony else
<emangamer> but still good
<RackishTilt> hmm, well mario_pony i think going directly to that girl is best
<Polydunami> fillyfillyy ikr
<emangamer> flutterSpin: you like where there isn't vocals?
<The_4th_Wall> pic seems legit
<fillyfillyy> lol brohoof Polydunami for both of us being awsome and seing it
<Polydunami> lol
<flutterSpin> I guess that would be electronic? or house? eh different genre
<Polydunami> (\
<Mutterguy> love hte fridge....
<fillyfillyy> are my messages not sending?
<Spectre> I live my life to the fullest. Hang with friends, enjoying everything im given, and loving the feeling of not dealing with stress and depression. I am not in any hurry to have a relationship. Am I wrong?
<emangamer> everyone should watch this one, it has a really great message: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFMj4uwuKSo

<fillyfillyy> emangamer
<emangamer> flutterSpin: by who?
<fillyfillyy> draw me
<fillyfillyy> being forever alone
<RackishTilt> i'd honestly try a point blank appraoch, ask her if shes seeing anyone and if not then tell her you think shes cool and you'd like to go out sometime
<emangamer> fillyfillyy: I want it to be happy
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Well guys, its time for me to hit the hay know...
<The_4th_Wall> Gotta eat evening NOMS
<fillyfillyy> draw me and somepony else :P

<emangamer> Scoot-Scootaloo: it's ok. it made me feel normal by comparison.

<TOY_PON3> Later Scoot-Scootaloo take care
<TOY_PON3> btw I'm back
<Everlasting_Joy> Scoot-Scootaloo This is the brony community, we are like that.
<RackishTilt> so who holds the record for being the oldest brony anyhow *curiouscurious*
<emangamer> Scoot-Scootaloo: I didn't mean that in a bad way. it showed me that I'm not the only one with problems
<Spectre> well, tomorrow going to be a let down
<RackishTilt> that happens sometimes but most girls understand mario_pony
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03see you guys tomorrow! And guys... you are all just awesome.

<TOY_PON3> Damn that sucks. Well I'm sure someday he will find his one. Obviously she wasn't.
<otakon> God I wish this was around while I was in High School
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Polydunami> Apparently, she was exactly like her?
<RackishTilt> mario_pony: i feel your pain bro, i was a big jerk to girls i was involved with too. i friend zone'd as often as i was friendzoned just to make a point
<TOY_PON3> otakon: I feel bad for being in high school when you say that...
<Spectre> Otakon: Same...would have mademy day better when i got home
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: it's all behind

<emangamer> I will sleep happy and content knowing that all of you guys got mah back....
<otakon> MLP makes things great
<Spectre> recalling the horrible lives we had before MLP
<Everlasting_Joy> RaveBrony we got on subjects of sadness, like our isolate natures and past loves.

<Polydunami> I don't think I'd like to base my happiness on ponies
<Polydunami> to be honest
<RaveBrony> Yeah, see his Luna! :)
<emangamer> Polydunami: may I ask why?
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: i will. gots one more year after this one

<Polydunami> I mean, it's true ponies make me happy and all
<Polydunami> But I don't know
<TOY_PON3> dammit brb
<flutterSpin> Anybody here excited about the Fighting is Magic game?
<MahBoi777> I ME
<fillyfillyy> ok
<RaveBrony> Ponies are absolutely great :) its another thing i can happily express :P
<RackishTilt> there are other things that make me happy besides ponies. but for those who have only ponies i can see why it is important
<Everlasting_Joy> TOY_PON3 of course!
<RaveBrony> Lol, i have Many things that make me happy xD
<TopHat> tits
<Everlasting_Joy> TOY_PON3 there's a reason my signature's third line is "You artists make me so jealous."
<Spectre> random word...
<RackishTilt> when the time comes you need to branch out and find other joys in life because ponies loving and tolerating might be around forever but you might just outgrow the fandom. it happens. love, tolerate and find your happiness, yeah?
<flutterSpin> http://www.mane6.com/ So excited
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: so many friends!
<RaveBrony> ^
<Polydunami> I'm more excited for My Little Investigations, honestly ^__^
<RaveBrony> I agree, RackishshTilt :P
<Spectre> Who here is a fan of Banjo Kazooie
<flutterSpin> that is freaky! I turn off rainy mood and the sound is still going FROM OUTSIDE

<Kaslai> I'm programmin'
<Spectre> i wish
<Polydunami> I love Banjo-Kazooie ^__^
<Polydunami> Such a great atmosphere
<flutterSpin> Sure there is the Equastia MMO layout game and the MLP Kart game
<MahBoi777> I still got that lalalalala song SuperBrony64 looped over and over again last night stuck in my head.
<Spectre> that space is 20% cooler vid?
<otakon> I'm still stoked for the MLP RPG in the works
<Polydunami> Good job SuperBrony64!
<Polydunami> ^__^
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777 Ha! I'm personally loving the Nic cage and "You're gonna go far kid" layover.
<MahBoi777> Spectre: eeyup, lol no regrets
<RackishTilt> my wife wrote up soemthing about jinjos once. she named one of the black ones 'jet' and has him with his head stuck in a tree getting to be 'one with nature'
