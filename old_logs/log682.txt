<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: cashieoh-wan lol
<Sumica> 00,10so is the rest of the world still useing that crazy metric system too instead of useing standard?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, imperial
<prince-dari> Who takes their milk in anything other than pints?
<cachi01> Sumica: metric system is best system
<CrimsonPhoenix> and metric makes more sense too
<twilight_sprinkle> dafuq is this cantemetor
<CrimsonPhoenix> Milk bags are the best system ever
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> anyway what's everyone doing cause i'm bored ?
<Sumica> 00,10if metric is so great then why dont we use it for time hmmmmm?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, why don't you use Imperial for time?
<StinkomanFan> IN CANADA MILK COMES IN BAGS
<Sumica> 00,10dafak is Imperial?

<Sumica> 00,10you meen standard

<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe right now it would be.....9 feet and 8 inches
<Ponies47> As always...
*Ponies47 Has no life
<CrimsonPhoenix> StinkomanFan, fun thing is that's true

<flutterchu> *hoofs
<Saturn> 08,01imperial is scky
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu, Pacman will be in
<cachi01> flutterchu: sora
<Dken2021> flutterchu Travis Touchdown?
<CrimsonPhoenix> or any Namco characters will be in
<cachi01> flutterchu: sora and i will be happy lol
<Arcane> Zero from mega man X
<CrimsonPhoenix> no one else from any other company
<prince-dari> I use a weird mixture of both
<FlutterMEDIC> flutterchu: Deadpool
<Fersure> Sumica: it isn't called 'standard'
<Ponies47> The only thing that I really do that is productive is I draw stuff sometimes
<flutterchu> CrimsonPhoenix: pac man has announced to be in the next game?
<Fersure> it is called 'imperial'
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: there were some FF characters in that shitty mario sports game
<Dken2021> Arcane he's already had enough, let X take the spotlight
<prince-dari> Large distances imperial
<dynamo2814> bye guys mothers at it again
<prince-dari> Small distances metric
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu, Namco bandai is doing it
<FlutterMEDIC> bye dynamo2814
<thelonepony> flutterchu: Gooby and sora
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, exactly
<flutterchu> BUCK YEAH
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Namco is also that kind to showoff
<CrimsonPhoenix> so they WILL put cameo characters
<Arcane> Dken2021 why have them both hell throw bass in there
<CrimsonPhoenix> and since Pacman is their mascot
<Fersure> prince-dari: I do that
<Fersure> but then I'm British
<Dken2021> Arcane touche
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pacman WILL be in there
<Fersure> so we use a mix of both
<Fersure> but our imperial measures are different to US ones
<Fersure> afaik
<prince-dari> Really?
<CrimsonPhoenix> or I change my name for Pinkfluffyunicorndancingonrainbows
<Fersure> yeah
<cachi01> Gooby , Dolan, Soba, kaibi, ribu, mansex
<flutterchu> i think we should have steve (minecraft) jimmy hopkins (bully) parrapa (parappa the rappa) and phoenix wright (ace attorney)
<prince-dari> Well distance is the same for us and them in imperial, surely?
<Fersure> that's why SI is so good
<FlutterMEDIC> flutterchu: that would be cool
<Fersure> because it standardises everything
<thelonepony> Best group cachi01
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu, there's MANY problem with your choices
<cachi01> flutterchu: well steve wont happen but theres a skin for it on brawl
<Fersure> no, US imperial differs in several ways
<cachi01> him*
<Saturn> 08,01except that imperial distances are *wrong*
<CrimsonPhoenix> steve is nowhere in any nintendo console as far as I know
<Fersure> which is why people prefer SI (metric)
<RaveBrony> I draw, but i want SAI since its so much easier to use.
<Fersure> it standardises everything
<Fersure> Saturn: wrong how?
<flutterchu> im saying what non-nintendo characters would be great in brawl
<CrimsonPhoenix> jimmy hopkins doesn't fit in well
<CrimsonPhoenix> parappa belong to sony
<FlutterMEDIC> bye guys
<CrimsonPhoenix> aaaand Phoenix wright is just no
<AdamTheDuck> Bye FlutterMEDIC
<flutterchu> CrimsonPhoenix: I KNOW
<thelonepony> bye FlutterMEDIC
<Saturn> 08,01Fersure: because everything should be in SI units
<CrimsonPhoenix> he's already being in one fighting game and he sucks
<Fersure> Saturn: I agree
<AdamTheDuck> Oh snap
<Fersure> but living in the UK means having to use imperial
<flutterchu> *i accedently pressed caps :'(
<Fersure> considering our roadsigns use miles
<Ponies47> I just use MS Paint
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: true, but it doesnt mean imperial is wrong, its justan annoying system, especially fahrenheit
<AdamTheDuck> I knew shygirl was trouble
<Ponies47> It's to basic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Do wath you want cause a pirate is free ~

<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: metric system is best system
<prince-dari> GTFO
<Fersure> considering a pint is 568ml

<twilight_sprinkle> NO U DABI

<Cypresswolf> back to my fanfic :)
<Dr_Fumbles> That... actually wasn't really that good...
<Kandarihu> And by entire crew, that includes the datadog
<Dr_Fumbles> In fact, it was pretty terrible
<thelonepony> that's the feeling when your in bronystate Arcane
<Kandarihu> Dr_Fumbles, what are you talking about? That was a hillarious twist ending
<Dark92Enigma> This anime is still awesome, it's Sci-fi action that has class (not that it is the only thing)
<thelonepony> you don't know how long you've been here
<StinkomanFan> Don't worry, that episode was non-canon :)
*Dken2021 is not sure how long he's been in idle
<Dr_Fumbles> Kandarihu: :S I guess...
<AJIsAwesome> So it was harmless? :S
<Ryunosuke> so it begins
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Arcane> thelonepony Well I got on here for the first time last night, So far i have not played any video games talked on skype or done any other important stuff

<Sabershy> AJIsAwesome: Same here. :)

<Sumica> 00,10death note turned to shit in the second half
<StinkomanFan> Never got the point to Death Note :|
<Arcane> Im going in the morning to get black 2 :D
<Dken2021> Sumica true
<AJIsAwesome> Sabershy: Yay! :)
<cachi01> Shizuka: but death note is an awesome anime :(
<twilight_sprinkle> death note was pretty meh from the start
<Shizuka> 13it was awful
<cachi01> waaaaah
*Dark92Enigma Cow-boy-cow-boy-cow-boy-cow-boy bebop!!!
<Biggysweet> opening is boss
<Dr_Fumbles> Sumica: What second half, the show died with L
<twilight_sprinkle> L is the only reason death note is watchable tbh
<Arcane> WHAT?!?!!?!??!?!
<Arcane> Death Note was great
<thelonepony> cachi01: it was awesome till L died
<Arcane> Till L died
<Shizuka> 13characters made leaps of judgment that no one could believably make
*Dark92Enigma LYRICS Cowboy Bebop's a show that I like! It stars a bounty hunter named Spike! And this really hot chick named Faye! A guy named Jet who may or may not be gay
<StinkomanFan> Another scary episode of Death Note?
<Dr_Fumbles> I only said good.
<Ryunosuke> i have to agree death not is meh
<Biggysweet> Swag up the ass intro
<thelonepony> i beat u to it Arcane :D
<Sumica> 00,10yeah 13 eps in L died
<Arcane> ._.
<Shizuka> 13seemed like every episode was a retcon of the one before it
<Dken2021> yea, I stopped watching when they introduced L's relatives
<Ryunosuke> I suppose it is good ... if you're an emo ;)
<cachi01> thelonepony: yeah... i fucking cried liek a bitch
<Sumica> 00,1013 eps later show ended
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: both that and it actually wasnt that clever either
<StinkomanFan> Another scary episode of Cowboy Bebop?
<Arcane> THey were not L's relatives they were other orphans o:
<something> hi eveypony
<Arcane> N and M
<Sabershy> Should have gotten white though, seeing as Resh/Kyurem as a better move pool, but I don't own a Zekrom though.
<thelonepony> Hi something
<Dr_Fumbles> The characters in DN were too fucking smart tho.
<Dr_Fumbles> Kinda silly
<cachi01> they were orphans. they explain how he met them in a movie called. ''L saves the world''
<something> thelonepony r u a lone

<Dken2021> Sabershy at least black 2 has challange mode
<Arcane> Ubers are not allowed in VGC so its makes no difference to this pony
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: at some times yes, and at sometimes they werent really taht clever at all

*Reikim whistles and listens for echo
<Dken2021> N was more of the puppet
<Kandarihu> I swear, every time Sumica starts streaming Cowboy Bebop, one of the episodes he streams is ALWAYS this episode.

<Dr_Fumbles> Fuck it, now that I think about it, I hate all Japanese anime
<AJIsAwesome> something: Nothing much. :)
<StinkomanFan> D:
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: maybe it's his/her favorite one?
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: have you watched code geass?
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: No
<Sabershy> or Fate/zero?
<something> lol did u see the pony
<DerpyMuffins> I remember this
<Sabershy> or Sword Art Online?
<Ryunosuke> MLG there folks
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: then watch it. its excellent. also ghost in the shell is quite good
<DerpyMuffins> Its really fucked up
<Dr_Fumbles> I'll give them a try
<Dark92Enigma> PIERROT LE FOU.....i still can't get if it's the name of a song
<Biggysweet> i never got into Ghost in the shell
<Kandarihu> One Piece is a great series. Absurdly long, though
<Arcane> My Little Pony: Friendship is magic, I hear its a really good show
<Dark92Enigma> SUDDENLY KILLING SPREE
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Agreed.
<cachi01> pewpewpewpewpewpewpew
<cachi01> 24 killstreak
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: ghost in the shell will take a lot of focus though, with code geass you can enjoy it both relaxed and focused
<StinkomanFan> Seriously Arcane?!
<cachi01> M.O.A.B ready for deployment
<Ryunosuke> wait
<Dark92Enigma> Try to edit it with a WEDDING
<thelonepony> the Penguin :O
<Dr_Fumbles> Arcane: Who the fuck would watch a show about ponies!?
<Biggysweet> HAX
<cachi01> Dr_Fumbles: IKR so fucking gay
<AJIsAwesome> Arcane: Ew gross, ponies........ <_<
<Ryunosuke> car cannot block bullets but trash can can?
<Sabershy> cheating clown
<Kandarihu> Dr_Fumbles, hahahahahahahahaaaaa... US!
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: I like shows that take focus
<Arcane> Combo
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: you wouldnt believe it, but there are these guys called bronies, who actually are huge fans of the pony show
<MirrorImage> 6 Hit Combo - Excellent!
<Silver_Soother> That air juggle...
<DerpyMuffins> This is really fucked up
<doctor_whooves127> he reminds me of that one guy from soal eater
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: they are all trolls
<MirrorImage> KITTY!
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: I call bullshit
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: probably yeah

<Dark92Enigma> Have you danced with the devil.....in the pale moonlight?
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: oh god
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah but I missed it
<J_E_Smith71> You don't really think you'll win do you?
<Dr_Fumbles> Too much action and no plot... so far
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01: had to pull it off
<StinkomanFan> HEAVY IS OP! NERF NOW!
<Biggysweet> i was sleeping in during a summer afternoon though
<Dark92Enigma> MOOD WHIPLASH
<Biggysweet> screw grammer
<Dr_Fumbles> Looks like a Micheal Bay film
<Dark92Enigma> NOT THE EXPLOSIVE NERF GUN!
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: but yeah, watch code geass, it has plot is dynamic, the characters are excellent, a lot of philosophy, and a very clever show, much more clever than death note imo
<Dark92Enigma> Dr_Fumbles: yes, but it has class......
<Biggysweet> Never forget Bob he is main character
<AJIsAwesome> Bob is best pony.
<twilight_sprinkle> inb4 sb
<Biggysweet> :p
<Biggysweet> ;)
<Arcane> 6_9
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: FINALLY! I like good, clever shows. Hope its on Netflix
<Biggysweet> how he eat
<Kandarihu> Well, the 2nd season of Code Geass has a pretty bad reputation.
<Dr_Fumbles> Dark92Enigma: There is a women in a short skirt and massive boobs -_-
<StinkomanFan> That bastard's gone and I'm STILL terrified
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: the first season is on youtube from the officials
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: I can understand that.

<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: Great, thx
<Sabershy> Kandarihu: Spinzaku is in it though...

<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: i don't mean to be a jerk, but Dr_Fumbles never watched the anime, and he has to watch the series before having an opinion
<flutterchu> is this show supposd to be scary ;_;
<thelonepony> nope
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, good point.
<Dark92Enigma> Polydunami: YES!
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: not usually, its just a creepy episode

<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: lots of them
<Dr_Fumbles> AJIsAwesome: Yeah
<Polydunami> Well, I can certainly appreciate such a voice, Silver_Soother :$

<DerpyMuffins> This episode was really messed up
<Dr_Fumbles> Kurra: ... ... yes?
<twilight_sprinkle> always i mean
<Kandarihu> Maybe the ISSP will pay up... but to Space Land for all the repairs they'll have to do.
<Kencolt> Kinetic forcefirlds were a major part of the novel "Dune", and the visual adaptations of the same.
<Kurra> I was gonna say who this man was and what he did. I forget his name >_<
<Kurra> Kencolt, I saw the movie Dune.
<Dr_Fumbles> Kurra: Oh, okay, lol.
<Kurra> Was bawss, and Picard is sorta timeless in that eh.
<Kencolt> Kurra: The book is vastly better.
<Kandarihu> As Jet put it in the first episode, "KILLED THE DOUGH!"
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah a smart forfield would be stupidly complex
<Sumica> 00,10it would need things like radar

<[Alpha-Trinity]> show combined
<Shizuka> 13no you aren't
<Silver_Soother> Cypresswolf: In my brothers old truck, he spilled coffee on his radio. It would play Relgion stations (which he never regularly listened too). Even after we removed it from the truck, it would still be playing. Nothing worse then always having to hear Relgious radio stations while you are trying to sleep. :P
<Cretor> I ddint mean anything i think?
<Kurra> Kandarihu, quoting that in this makes so much no sense... @_@
<twilight_sprinkle> lol

<Cades> ok that didn't work
<Vordox> <--- Good series
<Dr_Fumbles> ?
<Kencolt> Strangest Cartoon Disney Ever Did.
<thisguy> now i want to eat gummy bears
<Buytoast> you spam something enough times and anything can have a large number of views
<Kandarihu> Gummi Bears... now THAT takes me back.
<Kurra> indeed.
<Buytoast> doesn't make it good
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> I feel old
<Dr_Fumbles> Gummi bears... :S
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: There, I have to agree (Ray Willam What'shisface).
<[Alpha-Trinity]> now I want some gummy bears
<Vordox> Buytoast: So I ask you again, what have you to show the world with more views? =P
<Arcane> sonic
<Arcane> o:
<Phase4> its kinda disapointing, there used to be an arms race betwene warner bro's and disney, now theres not as much. seems to be starting up again though thanks to hasbro

<Kencolt> I suspect when he did this he'd never heard of FiM.
<Arcane> oh man
<Kurra> Haaahahahahahaa.
<Buytoast> the funny part is you're treating views as a way of saying something is good
<thisguy> he'd better not sing the g2-g3 and such
<Phase4> thisguy, he doesn't
<Buytoast> good stuff can be overshadowed by crap like this
<Vordox> Buytoast: Money
<Cretor> g3 is best ponies
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: Also, edgy (adj): Tense, nervous, or irritable. I don't see why anyone would try being edgy.
<Vordox> Lol
<thisguy> O.O
<Kandarihu> I'll bet this guy did this in multiple parts. Every time the camera changes, might've been a point where he messed up and started over a little bit earlier
<Cretor> i hope i dont get a ban for that
<Cypresswolf> Few remember the Little Bits - was the first anime I ever saw - aired on Nick early in the morning back in the day before I was old enough to go to school

<doctor_whooves127> captian planet is next right?
<Dr_Fumbles> Wow, television really changed
<Kurra> I always missed this series.
<Vordox> Dr_Fumbles: Welcome to the Sensitive 2000s
<Kandarihu> There's a law that all American TV stations have to air about 6 hours of educational children's TV a week. So this was VERY lucrative in syndication
<Cypresswolf> There used to be a board game - was discontinued long ago though :(
<Dr_Fumbles> Vordox: le sigh

<Silver_Soother> Phase4: You didn't know about the animated series?
<Dr_Fumbles> What the hell is a Mega Man?
<[Alpha-Trinity]> when I was younger I spent most of my time outside than inside.
<Cypresswolf> Who remembers Mighty Max?
<Spectrum_Rush> cartoon Phase4 by dic
<superretroworld> night RaveBrony
<DashWithRainbows> Ew, animals.
<Kandarihu> Phase4, I'm pretty sure this is western animation
<Cretor> what is this blasphemy?
<Phase4> Silver_Soother, i do not
<Sumica> 00,10I think he might be a super fighting robot named megaman by this intro.
<OohShiny> Phase4: there's also the anime, battle network
<doctor_whooves127> i remember mighty max
<Kurra> When the heck did THIS air?? Action-packed! :O
<Kandarihu> I think I watched a little of this when it was new
<Arcane> Megaman X4 anyone?
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Nah, I don't see it.
<Polydunami> Well, if it was an anime, it'd be Rock Man :P
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: I don't see what makes you see that.
<sub06905|TARDIS> if i remember correctly DashWithRainbows hates everything
<Phase4> Sumica, really? thought i was the only one getting that feel
<Kandarihu> Enough to remember the chanting theme.
<Dr_Fumbles> those intelligent lyrics...
<Silver_Soother> Phase4: That's a shame friend. I remember watching this as a kid.
<DashWithRainbows> Damn straight.
<Polydunami> I remember that there WAS a show
<OohShiny> dis
<thisguy> yay
<VenHur> I'm back, and whoa, Mega Man!

<thelonepony> the XMEN
<Barbetos> Show more videos about robot boys
<Kandarihu> Oh, YEAH! X-Men! Now THIS is a show I watched the heck out of
<Barbetos> It won't be creepy or anything.
<Kurra> I should get this whole series again.
<Vordox> Buytoast: Rugrats...? You're born in the late 1980 or begining of 1990?
<Arcane> this show scared me when i was young ._.
<AJIsAwesome> SO MUCH NOSTALGIA! I CAN'T TAKE IT!
<VenHur> Never seen this...
<Cypresswolf> Its a Rocketeer ripoff with an Astro Boy ripoff - Big Guy & Rusty

<Mega_Milk> What no night crawler???
<AJIsAwesome> Jubilee is best pony.
<[Alpha-Trinity]> yeah I forgot a lot of my childhood due to the fact that I was hit by a car and nearly knocked into a coma
<Kurra> What was so amazing about it was that it addressed race and culture issues through the conflict between mutants and humans in the show
<OohShiny> anyone has a gambit ponified pic? I need it now
<Kandarihu> All the way to it's untimely end... yeah, I know it went on for a while

<Vordox> Buytoast: I dunno, heard of Brave Starr or Thunder Cats? =P
<Kurra> this was best animated opening EVAR
<Phase4> COPS
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: Except for vests, obviously.
<Kandarihu> I think I only remember that slogan from a toy ad I saw from other shows.
<Vordox> Kurra: Not even close :P
<flutterchu> what show is this
<Dr_Fumbles> Captain Planet... I never liked that show...
<doctor_whooves127> ha cops never seen this but the intro kicks butt
<OohShiny> flutterchu: COPS
<Cypresswolf> the 80's! Fuck Yeah!
<Kurra> Vordox, I know, sorta, but... it was one minute of such excellence...
<Cretor> there needs to be a show like this that glorifies engineers
<Vordox> Kurra: It still is :D

<Kandarihu> SWAT KATS! Yeah!
<AJIsAwesome> YES

<Polydunami> Oh, wow
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Dinosaucers sounds like a cheap toy I would find in the toy section of the cereal aisle.
<Dr_Fumbles> Back when Furries were acceptable
<Buytoast> at least there was an animated movie
<Buytoast> and this seems very familiar
<Lyra`> theyre still acceptable.
<Barbetos> So my good friend is getting lessons in kick boxing. This is what I had to say, "Kicking teeth in for fun and profit is the skill set you have been missing. Put it on all your resumes, and I think the employers will get the hint."
<Lyra`> by other furries.
<Cypresswolf> Biker Mice From Mars! :)
<doctor_whooves127> i like the other intro better
<[Alpha-Trinity]> before I go. This show is AWESOME
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Lyra`> but that show is old and gay.
<Phase4> NewSuperBronyU, assuming it could be found in the average supermarket and not just some $2 store
<Vordox> Sumica: PIrates of Dark Water?
<AJIsAwesome> Lyra`: :(
<Cypresswolf> Just shouting stuff at this point :P
<[Alpha-Trinity]> that is all.
<thisguy> not the gummi bears >:|
<OohShiny> wut?
<Kammerjunk> Hell, I'm not even a furry, and I still accept the buggers.
<Lyra`> oh god
<Vordox> ....
<VenHur> Swat mother [yay]ing Kats!
<OohShiny> Pizza Cats?
<doctor_whooves127> pizza cats
<Kandarihu> I'm not sure if I watched all of SWAT KATS. It was more of "if I'm somewhere where there's cable and it's on and I'm bored"
<Lyra`> samurai pizza cats!
<Vordox> <--- Please tell me that's American
<Vordox> :D
<sub06905|TARDIS> pharmacy store has best toys :3
<Dr_Fumbles> OH FUCK KILL ME NOW
<Polydunami> Dang, I only know of the video game
<Kurra> I liked Speedy best.
<Sumica> 00,10nope
<OohShiny> I'm not old enough for this
<Sumica> 00,10this was an anime
<Dr_Fumbles> I WANT DEATH!!!!
<Vordox> Oh mai god
<Vordox> So random
<Vordox> :D
<Polydunami> And I only know the video game because of Deceased Crab :S
<thelonepony> really :D
<doctor_whooves127> oh how about speed racer
<Kandarihu> I should look for legit fansubs of this.
<VenHur> The Samurai Pizza Cats is dubbed by Saban btw.
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: So this show took a serious tone, and America took a comedic tone with it?
<Kencolt> One of my all time favorite shows. They never got scripts from Japan, just rough outlines of the plots-- so what they did was wing it and make everything up. To great success.
<Cretor> i had a crush on poly when i was a kid
<Dr_Fumbles> please... kill me...
<Phase4> it was an anime but all the scripts were lost before they could translate into english
*weeping_pegasi82 sighs
<Polydunami> Wait, what, Cretor?
<Kandarihu> And yes, I watched this... shortly after I discovered Sailor Moon and fell in love with anime.
<Sumica> 00,10yep AJIsAwesome
<Cretor> ...nothing.......
<Polydunami> :D
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: :D
<VenHur> Yeah, Saban, you know...the guys that made Power Rangers, Masked Rider, Beetleborgs, and all that.
<Silver_Soother> AJIsAwesome: That's Amurica for you. :P
<sub06905|TARDIS> not sure what i just saw
<Vordox> Sumica: Pirates of Dark Wateeeer!
<AJIsAwesome> I can't believe that show was supposed to be serious. :D
<flutterchu> pizza means pie in ittalian
<Ponies47> Dat sub06905|TARDIS :3
<OohShiny> I saw gummi bears
<sub06905|TARDIS> dat Ponies47 :3
<Phase4> XD
<Kandarihu> Sumica, thanks
<OohShiny> the original opening?
<Vordox> Original
<Phase4> dat orignal intro
<OohShiny> nice
<Vordox> O.o
<thisguy> that's the original?
<Polydunami> Okay this is the original
<Dr_Fumbles> Of course... it's Japanese -_-
<Lyra`> much better than the last one.
<Cretor> oh gosh, why did my brother show this stuff to me?
<Phase4> now we have the internet someone must have done a propper translation of this
*doctor_whooves127 no clue whats being said
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'll be going now. School'n'stuff.
<Dr_Fumbles> fuckin furries
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, because American kids prefer hot-blooded shows over cutesy shows
<Kammerjunk> Valedico.
<Sumica> 00,10yes Phase4
<Kimori> lol
<Kencolt> The original, Kyatto Ninden Teyandee, was just as silly-- but almost every joke was so rooted in Japanese Culture, history, and wordplay that an accurate translation would have fallen and burned.
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Kammerjunk. :)
<Mega_Milk> Using a cannon for faster travel?
<Phase4> Sumica, any good?
<Mega_Milk> I like it.
<Polydunami> See you, Kammerjunk
<Sumica> 00,10never watched it
<Dr_Fumbles> I'll take AtLA anyday
<Phase4> ah
<thisguy> same
<thelonepony> bye Kammerjunk
<flutterchu> atleast parappa the rappa didnt get an anime
<Vordox> Kencolt: But nowadays, you can understand it if you go into the Japanese Culture :P
<Cretor> dem kitties
<Buytoast> why would he
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: It did.
<OohShiny> dis
<Vordox> Like Gintama or Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei
<flutterchu> AJIsAwesome: okay
<OohShiny> dis was awesome
<AJIsAwesome> Parappa DID get an anime. :S
<Kencolt> Samurai Pizza Cats kept the base plot-- whidch they did have-- and just ran with the lunacy of the visuals, randomly made stuff up-- and iw worked brilliantly.
<superretroworld> i haven seen any of these shows
<thisguy> i'd like to see dbz abriged streamed someday here :P
<Cretor> top left please
<Polydunami> It was streamed before, thisguy
<flutterchu> NO

<OohShiny> this was an awesome show
<Kandarihu> I vaguely remember watch this. But I'm pretty sure I watched it
<Lyra`> jump out of a perfectly good spaceship
<Kandarihu> All I remember is the opening
<Polydunami> I recognize this song
<Dr_Fumbles> Okay... television was pretty sill back then

<Sumica> 00,10it never got an ending
<AJIsAwesome> What?
<Cypresswolf> I remember that bird! and that's about it from this show
<Lyra`> 80s cartoons bore me
<Dr_Fumbles> This is more like it
<AJIsAwesome> How can that be?
<Lyra`> they always end the same
<Phase4> Panda|Homework, if its seriously 20% of sales interesting stuff will happen
<thisguy> reminds me of "blood wake"
<AJIsAwesome> DAT POST :D
<Kandarihu> Cartoon Network kinda trolled their viewers about the lack of an ending
<Polydunami> That is, not at all, Lyra`?
<Panda|Homework> I mean, its only an educated guess based on region. but then again... and kid that buys a pony toy would be considered a brony.... no Phase4?
<superretroworld> Sumica: just like what happened to my name is earl
<Kurra> oooh.
<Vordox> BRAVE STARR<3

<Sumica> 00,10greeks in space
<OohShiny> Kingdom of Hades
<OohShiny> lol
<Polydunami> Why do I recognise this?
<Phase4> Panda|Homework, what i'm wondering is how many sales are occouring because of the older fanbase, because i'm betting it more than covers the cost of the talent needed to pull it off
<superretroworld> then since the 60s and 70s
<sub06905|TARDIS> should have asked Kratos for help
<OohShiny> Kingdom of Hades is so wroooong
*Jmo slaps Panda|Homework around a bit with a large trout

<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: opinions of what?
<Lyra`> pole position sounds like a sexual thing.
<Buytoast> but it's the trith
<thisguy> i had no idea of that o.o
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: About Homestuck.
<twilight_sprinkle> Cretor: *heroic strippers!
<doctor_whooves127> isnt that a videogame?
*Kurra qualifies
<thisguy> i dont see any F1 cars
<AJIsAwesome> Not the truth, your opinion.
<OohShiny> I've seen this somewhere, but still, I'm not old enough to this
<NocturnalBlade> Lyra`: i know right :D
<GeeBlitz> The link was a ZIP and i didnt even check.
<Kandarihu> Okay. This is... I don't know. What the heck? I know it's based on a game that has none of this.
<Cretor> pole protectors!
<Buytoast> not too much of a difference when it comes to things like homestuck
<Kencolt> Based on a video game.
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: i've been shown homestuck a couple times...its pretty funny lol
<Kandarihu> Is this cartoon supposed to be selling us on a game for something it doesn't have?
<Polydunami> There is no objective evidence which suggests to me that Homestuck is terrible.
<Kurra> YAAAY GEM!
<Buytoast> really?
<OohShiny> outragous
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: I still have to see it.
<Lyra`> oh god

<Dr_Fumbles> I've never seen Homestuck before
<Kurra> Also rotoscoping

<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: i am running a Full system scan atm i am really hopeing it detects it

<Kurra> Mid 90s were possibly sweeter.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Inb4 Madoka Magica
<superretroworld> Kandarihu: i grew up with sisters so i was used to watching girl shows, so it was easy for me giving mlp a chance

<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 goof troop
<Lyra`> i remember in my childhood seeing something really disturbing about tah mouse with the plug on his chest

<Kandarihu> Okay. I don't think I watched this
<OohShiny> Duckula?
<Cypresswolf> I know I at least had D.W
<Vordox> Sumica: This reminds me of that series with "the trap door/Hatch"
<J_E_Smith71> Kandarihu: This is a British cartoon that was on Nick in the 80s
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: my brother already tried to reboot it for me
<Cypresswolf> Inb4 Might Ducks

<AJIsAwesome> Necromancy......you know, for kids!
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: my full system scan just finish it didnt detected it
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: im screwed.

<Lyra`> oh god
<OohShiny> danger mouse
<Lyra`> danger mouse.
<Kandarihu> Okay. I DEFINITELY remember Dangermouse
<Cretor> Lyra' are we going to watch ytp's?
<Dr_Fumbles> GeeBlitz: You MUST set Restore disks when you get a new computer
<Polydunami> Wish I knew this when I took that Sporcle quiz :P
<J_E_Smith71> And of course you can't have Duckula without DM
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: do you wanna be a theripist when you grow up?
<OohShiny> there's too many bombs in the intro
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: Nope. Chemist. :)
<Kurra> Danger Mouse is best demo.
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: im just so freaking stupid
<OohShiny> dat music
<J_E_Smith71> And now some Bakishi and John K
<Kandarihu> This didn't last long, but I watched this.

<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: oh, cause you always want to help ppl on here which is nice. therpist is also what im planning to do
<Kandarihu> I remember this, too.

<Dr_Fumbles> GeeBlitz: Don't worry, there is ways to get rid of it
<AJIsAwesome> This show was AMAZING to me.
<thisguy> the eternal struggle wen on for longer than you think, it says :P
<Polydunami> I remember the classic cartoons...
<Lyra`> theres something cruel when they kick kitten toms ass
<CrimsonPhoenix> I remember this intro
<Cypresswolf> I didnt much care for this show - I watched A Pup Named Scooby Doo - that was a catchy theme song
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: Oh. I'm just being helpful and courteous. I could see why you would think that, though.
<OohShiny> super ted?
<Sumica> 00,10GeeBlitz, short of runing a ton of scan programs while in safemade and offline you are rather hosed short of paying some one.
<Kurra> I never heard of this one.

<Buytoast> FUCKING RED HERRING
<J_E_Smith71> Oh man Superted

<NocturnalBlade> Buytoast: so true lol
<Cypresswolf> Cordoroys!
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: I watched both. I found both of those shows terrific.
<J_E_Smith71> This was on Disney I think

<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: we are both therapists are bronystate /)
<Starlight_Phoenix> LOL
<J_E_Smith71> Now to say my Magic Word
<Lyra`> hold up let me tear off my SKIN!
<J_E_Smith71> Okay here's one I don't know
<CrimsonPhoenix> this isn't Earthbound
<AJIsAwesome> BEST BACKSTORY EVER.
<GeeBlitz> Sumica: i have tried many scan programs none detected it .
<Spectrum_Rush> Vordox: research must be done
<Cypresswolf> Lovely animation style :)
<Kandarihu> Definitely haven't watched this
<OohShiny> ALVIN!
<Sumica> 00,10ow my ears
<CrimsonPhoenix> WELP
<Polydunami> Oh yeah
<Lyra`> hated this show sooo much.
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: I'm not a therapist, but I'll brohoof you anyway. (\ :)
<Vordox> Oh god...
<Sumica> 00,10same here Lyra`
<Cypresswolf> Yeah Baby!
<Silver_Soother> As much as going down the Nostaglic Walk is fun, I am afriad I must take leave.
<Kandarihu> Oh yes. I watched this so much
<J_E_Smith71> Back when Alvin was great before CGI
<NocturnalBlade> bye Silver_Soother
<Polydunami> I really liked this opening
<AJIsAwesome> I actually LOVED this intro. :$
<thisguy> the actually decent chipmunks :)
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: well on here you sort of are :D
<Cypresswolf> Back when Chipmunks were cool - before those movies ruined them!
<NocturnalBlade> so this intro sooooo much lol
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: Oh. :D
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: brb let me try to look to see if i have the disks
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: PRECISELY.
<Dr_Fumbles> GeeBlitz: k
<OohShiny> thisguy: because the new chipmunks are too mainstream
<Sumica> 00,10underwater smurfs
<thisguy> kids today NEED to watch this before they watch the current versions
<Lyra`> oh god.
<Cypresswolf> DOOT DOOT Dododo DOOT
<Lyra`> snorks
<Cretor> this
<Lyra`> the poor mans smurfs
<OohShiny> thisguy: except for mlp right?
<J_E_Smith71> thisguy: Well they still sell the old ones on DVD
<AJIsAwesome> Never could get into Snorks, IMO.
<J_E_Smith71> This wasn't the main Snork intro
<Kandarihu> The one thing that all of these intros have in common is that they all are heavy handed in SELLING viewers the rest of the show.
<thisguy> that should be a rule. to have kids watch the orignal versions before letting them watch the current. at least they'll be able to know which is better o.o
<Polydunami> I wish this didn't remind me of that Family Guy cutaway :(
<Kandarihu> Okay, maybe this isn't quite so bad.
<Cypresswolf> almost 12:30...if I wake up late, I can always call in sick :)
<Sumica> 00,10here we go
<doctor_whooves127> sea pony version of smurfs
<J_E_Smith71> This was the first Snorks intro, not the one I'm familiar with
<OohShiny> TINY TOON!
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH MY GOSH
<Lyra`> this one was good.
<Lyra`> i liked tiny toons.
<AJIsAwesome> YES!
<thisguy> a little?
<J_E_Smith71> "Swim along with the snorks, come along with the snorks"
<Kurra> It was. It is.
<NocturnalBlade> oh god...<3
<Cypresswolf> I dont think I used any sick days this year
<Spectrum_Rush> SO MUCH YES
<AJIsAwesome> ALL MY YES!
<thelonepony> <3
<Vordox> Sumica: Talk about feeling older and older...
<Rosfox> I remember this show <3
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: no i dont..
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pinkie's history
<Kandarihu> If this show hadn't come along when it did, I would've sworn off all animation upon my 13th birthday.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Starlight_Phoenix> there was this and animanics
<Sumica> 00,10ikr Vordox
<Polydunami> Yeah, I hardly watched the show.
<thelonepony> :D
<Kurra> What people dunno is that this show launched lots of furs as well.
<Cypresswolf> Censors? What censors >_>
<Dr_Fumbles> GeeBlitz: Dang...
<Kurra> :D
<Kurra> Gogo! :D
<Polydunami> I only played the Super Nintendo game
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: my desktop icons are acually still flashing...
<OohShiny> Dodo was epic
<Kandarihu> And yes. This still is the same syndrome I mentioned
<Vordox> Cypresswolf: Not the ones who did the famous "Dirty jokes" of Animaniacs :D
<J_E_Smith71> How I Spent My Vacation was awesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kurra, this show is only a small portion of furries
<Sumica> 00,10some one said animaniacs?
<J_E_Smith71> It's on DVD finally
<OohShiny> Animaniacs
<Polydunami> And this one
<Buytoast> oh boy
<thisguy> i never could understand that dodo, meaning they really did a good job with that character O.O
<Kurra> Steven Spielberg, thank you :)
<Lyra`> <3
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<thelonepony> <3
<NocturnalBlade> <3 oh hell yea ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> YES!
<Kurra> CrimsonPhoenix, indeed.
<thisguy> woot
<Polydunami> This is a pitch higher than I remember.
<CrimsonPhoenix> IT'S TIME FOR AAAANIMANIACS
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: do you happen to have a skype?
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica I love you
<Kurra> :D
<AJIsAwesome> SO MUCH YES!
<Kandarihu> Just be aware that this opening involves a couch gag.
<Dr_Fumbles> GeeBlitz: Don't beat yourself over this, the Skype virus got A LOT of people.
<Starlight_Phoenix> i like this show much more than tiny toons
<OohShiny> this is not meant for kids, seriously
<thelonepony> this show :D
<Cretor> OMG ihaventseenthis since i was like 3
<AJIsAwesome> Thank you so much, Sumica! :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kurra, but seriously the whole 90's made a lot of furries
<Kurra> This was my most favoritest show EVER EVER EVER EVER! That's like, 4 evers!
<Dr_Fumbles> GeeBlitz: No, which is why I was spared
<Vordox> Sumica: The World Map Song? ;)
<Kandarihu> The couch gag was removed for the Nickelodeon version.
<thisguy> reminds me of nostalgia critic's top 11 involving animaniacs
<Sumica> 00,10might as well
<Kurra> GOODFEATHERS
<thisguy> forgot the name though
<CrimsonPhoenix> they was ALOT of shows with anthro characters
<Kencolt> This was basically Spielberg's attempt to see what the hell he could get away with.
<J_E_Smith71> The Skype virus is terrible, it even infected my friend's camera (Or at least made it so he can't upload videos to it)
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: mm
<Lyra`> is it wrong that i have a legit lesbian crush on rita?
<CrimsonPhoenix> this video is proof of that
<Vordox> Kencolt: It's famous attempt that Steven was just pulling out everything he could think of
<Lyra`> the voice actor of her anyway.
<thisguy> fcked up in the brainy..... x.x
<Vordox> SAILOR MOON
<Kurra> United States Canada, Mexico Panama, Haiti Jamaica Peru....
<Cypresswolf> Vordox: Regular Show has some great adult jokes - Im convinced some of the Animaniac censors ok RS
<OohShiny> I see ghostbusters
<twilight_sprinkle> J_E_Smith71: camera?..cameras dont run on windows..
<Lyra`> oof, rita <3
<Buytoast> but regular show is bad
<OohShiny> o.o
<Vordox> Woot?
<NocturnalBlade> ummm...wat?
<Polydunami> Of all the things the censors got antsy about in animaniacs, it had to be Minerva Mink :S
<OohShiny> wut??
<Lyra`> oh god
<Sumica> 00,10some one asked for it
<Lyra`> kill this show.
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm????
<J_E_Smith71> And here's the Wuzzles
<twilight_sprinkle> J_E_Smith71: you sure its not just the driver on his pc
<Kurra> Now THIS launched furs too :D
<Vordox> Something I've NEVER seen
<Kurra> I LOVED THIS SHOW!
<Kurra> :D
<Lyra`> original doesnt mean better
<J_E_Smith71> twilight_sprinkle: I think it was the driver
<AJIsAwesome> Never seen this one..........
<Kandarihu> I vaguely remember... okay. I guess I was aware OF this show, but never watched it.
<twilight_sprinkle> J_E_Smith71: k
<Lyra`> autistic children with downs syndrome are original
<CrimsonPhoenix> They tried a bit too hard with this
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: atleast we still had Hellooooo Nurse
<CrimsonPhoenix> HEY GUYS LISTEN
<Lyra`> doesnt mean theyre useful
<Kurra> Hippobunny 83
<Polydunami> Well, yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> HOW ABOUT WE
<GeeBlitz> Dr_Fumbles: thank you so much for your time and i hope i get this fixed even if it means rebooting and loosing everything
<Dr_Fumbles> GeeBlitz: I'd suggest calling tech support. The number should have come with your computer
<Sumica> 00,10robot chicken killed that show for me
<J_E_Smith71> Disney's first attempt at Saturday cartoons
<Polydunami> But Minerva was hilarious :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> mixed up animals together

<Vordox> (Also they forgot 3 or 4 countries)
<Kurra> YES YES YES AAAaaaaa Sumica :)
<OohShiny> Imagine the VA trying to memorize this
*AJIsAwesome attempts to sing along
<Dr_Fumbles> I could watch Animaniacs till I die
<Vordox> OohShiny: He still remembers it
<Vordox> Ther'es a live version of him doing it
<Polydunami> Also, the United Kingdom is separated into three?
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: That's awesome.

<Kandarihu> Eeyup. Yakko mentioned Israel. Inb4 Fatwah
<thisguy> singing spanish song while discussing other countries, your argument is invalid
<OohShiny> Vordox: But imagine how hard it was for him to memorize, that's what I meant
<Kurra> I saw Rob Paulsen sing this song twice live at Anthrocon :D
<OohShiny> lol
<Kurra> Perfect perfect.
<Vordox> Sumica: Remember the video about American and being geographical inadequeate, And yet they STILL have this?!
<OohShiny> I'll never memorize that seriously

<Lyra`> you will pay for this.
<thisguy> woot more
<Spectrum_Rush> now if only it could be updated
<Kurra> A few countries are no more. Also Lesotho was not included in the song because its sovereignty was in dispute until recently, I think
<Sumica> 00,10there are a few fan lyrics to this to bring it up to date
<J_E_Smith71> Now another great one

<Kurra> Al Gore was President of the USA for about twelve minutes once.
<J_E_Smith71> Ryunosuke: At least Animaniacs made it fun

<Ryunosuke> oh this

<Ninjazz> Oh good. The good seasons before everything got politcal.
<AdamTheDuck> Now that I think of it, I think I heard that quote from Klumzeedragon
<Gold_Demona> It's pretty safe to assume everybody's male here. 9 times out of ten, you're probably right. :D

<MadSurge> Ninjazz: then I never saw them :(
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, :/ the joke is php (programing language) is broken in the same way that hammer is. sure you can hit nails with it but its a clearly broken tool
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, they're usually burried underneath all the regular stuff.
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: you mean FPSes?
<Ninjazz> Phase4, that looks rather ineffective.
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, well not all shooters are FPS's.

<Mutterguy> Well, the first thing I do remeber is that you hated it. Can't remember who the other person was though...
*AdamTheDuck licks Mutterguy
<Mutterguy> no
<Ninjazz> Hate might not be the word. It was more "oh gawd what the hell do I do" moment. And did the name start with a G?
<Jmo> Denied.
<Gold_Demona> Ok, I've been trying to figure it out, but it's not making any sense to me so I have to ask. What does ">" mean in this chat context?
<AdamTheDuck> :<
*Mutterguy squirts AdamTheDuck with a spray bottle
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, it's basically a quote.
*AdamTheDuck gives Mutterguy a cookie. :<
<Jmo> You are a quote Ninjazz.
<Jmo> :>
<Ninjazz> A meaningful quote? :o
<Jmo> a sxy quote
<Gold_Demona> Ninjazz: So when you said ">Tried" you were quoting somebody?
<Phase4> ok...
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, quoting myself to be exact.
<Mutterguy> um.. can't eat cookies sorry :(
<Phase4> cant unlink open files on windows
<Gold_Demona> ah
<Phase4> due to permison denied o_O
<thelonepony> well night everypony need the sleeps
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, <Ninjazz> Mutterguy, and to think I've been trying to tone all that stuff down. =w= (I said "trying")
<Ninjazz> Phase4, wut.

<DeadpoolDash> a boobie trap that actually catches boobies
<Mutterguy> sigh do i that to make ornithology jokes again?

<MadSurge> Wrek: yeah, boobies! :D

<AdamTheDuck> Bye Wrek
<brony2447> doughnutjoe: reminds me of this one pic...gimme a sec
<BoroBrony> later Wrek
<Phase4> y u no creating directory
<RoboGerbil> right now my steam is using 63 mb, firefox using 344 mb
<Ninjazz> Jmo, when will the magic resume? ;~;
<Jmo> When you finally get your ass on Firefox.
<Gold_Demona> My chrome doesn't do that, AdamTheDuck. How do I make it do that? WIth the little boxes and stuff? D:
<BoroBrony> my steam is using like 50 and my firefox like 300 :P
<Ninjazz> When I upgrade this POS to Windows 7. >_<
<Mutterguy> ouch. that's a bad way to end a relationship
<doughnutjoe> Replace Firefox icon with spitfire GO!
<Phase4> stupid php
<brony2447> doughnutjoe: http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/27800000/No-Yoshi-No-Problem-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-27843791-900-560.jpg
<Phase4> it silently replaces non existant object attributes with null
<Jmo> ;_;
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, umm, can't remember what it was called...
<Jmo> i cnt stp wubbing u ninja
<Phase4> so you can do the wrong thing and it wont tell you
<Ninjazz> <3
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, something "dial"...
<AdamTheDuck> Speed dial, I think
<Gold_Demona> Sounds right
<Jmo> i has ninja on my sped dial
<doughnutjoe> brony2447 :D
<Jmo> cuz he is sxy n speshul
<Gold_Demona> Safari on my Mac has soemthing similar, but with MUCH more boxes.
<brony2447> doughnutjoe: its true too!
<doughnutjoe> brony2447 eeyup!
<brony2447> doughnutjoe: lol and if you look in the background you can see luigi with derpy :D
<doughnutjoe> we should really get a big mac emoticon
<BoroBrony> my alienware is amazing till you fill it full of crap :P :D
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, you can add or remove boxes with this.
<Jmo> ..Alienware
<doughnutjoe> brony2447 Easter ggs!
<brony2447> doughnutjoe: lol yeah
<doughnutjoe> eggs*
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: It has a set number of boxes. Whatever boxes you don't pin with your own bookmarks it fills in with recently visited websites.
<BoroBrony> yes they do gaming laptops and computers with amazing ram and graphics
<Jmo> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Jmo> That's a good joke.
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, that's strange, when I add a box; it asks what website you want in the box.
<brony2447> my brother has a gaming laptop
<doughnutjoe> uggh why do i always get these terrible headaches when it rains :(
<BoroBrony> :/
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: It's a different thing. You don't add the boxes. They're just there.
*Mutterguy assumes Jmo is a guy but can't be sure
<BoroBrony> yeah they a good awesome
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, oh right~
<brony2447> doughnutjoe: its a side affect from the epic music+rein
<Jmo> LOlLL
<brony2447> *rain
<Jmo> Awesome and Alienware don't mix.
<Jmo> Neither does gaming.
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: And if you want specific boxes to go to specific sites, you tell it what URL you want it to be.
<AdamTheDuck> Mwf I realise I go on deviantart more than Youtube.
<Jmo> Alienware is a joke.
<Mutterguy> my other assumption is Jmo is a 15 old girl
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Instead of the recently visited URL that was put there
<Rain> yes, brony2447?
<doughnutjoe> brony2447 nahim not even listening to anything
<Jmo> I'm a muffin Mutterguy
<doughnutjoe> Rain, You give me head aches! :D
<brony2447> Rain: lol srry i made a typo in a sentence about actual rain my bad
<Gold_Demona> You're a muffin, Jmo? What flavor? :O
<Rain> lol
<BoroBrony> really
<Mutterguy> ok that's now my mental of you Jmo. blue berry or chocolate?
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, I just wanted more space to look steampunk Octavia so I installed that thingy so that I only add the boxes I really need :$
<Jmo> Whatever flavor you desire.
<AdamTheDuck> so I can look at steampunk Octavia*
<Jmo> I'm the magical muffni.
<Jmo> muffin^
*AdamTheDuck noms Jmo because he is muffin
<brony2447> why do fraps files have to be so big T_T
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Well, in my case, I need the 24 boxes that are on the screen. I have THAT many websites I go to. XD
<Mutterguy> I can't eat muffins for the same reason i can't eat cookies
<Gold_Demona> One of those boxes is Bronystate, of course. :>
<DeadpoolDash> fraps isnt compressed
<brony2447> 12.4 gigs, DAAYUM
<DeadpoolDash> you have to compress it youself with a seperate program
<Phase4> Perfect
<Jmo> Sony Vegas4lyf
<Phase4> little bit of polish is needed
<doughnutjoe> Hey Bronystate are you buying Halo 4?
<Phase4> but this is working
<RoboGerbil> hmm steampunk in space sounds interesting
<brony2447> DeadpoolDash: ik i use WMM
<Jmo> lolhalo
<Gold_Demona> Spacepunk?
<AdamTheDuck> RoboGerbil, that would be cyberpunk I believe.
<BoroBrony> dam right HALO FTW :D :D
<Phase4> dat massive error
<RoboGerbil> AdamTheDuck: nah cyberpunk is like ghost in the shell
<DeadpoolDash> just saying that is why fraps is big, because it is raw video
<AdamTheDuck> Still has that sci-fi look
<doughnutjoe> w-w-what's wrong with Halo Jmo?
<BoroBrony> yeah fraps is pretty cool
<Jmo> Halo is a milked franchise that needs to die already.
<Phase4> Almost completely perfect
<BoroBrony> and steampunk is awesome
<doughnutjoe> Jmo NO
<Gold_Demona> So spaceships that run on steam?
<doughnutjoe> Jmo NEVAR
<Jmo> Same goes with Call of Duty.
<doughnutjoe> :3
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, seems legit
<Ponies47> Good morning :3
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, you have a point there. Halo 3 was supposed to be the last.
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, you there?
<RoboGerbil> Gold_Demona: thats a start
<Jmo> Exactly
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, eeyup.
<Phase4> just checking
<Gold_Demona> Gears everywhere
<Phase4> Oh, jeremy soule worked on morrowind didnt he
<DeadpoolDash> yes
<Phase4> i was wondering
<DeadpoolDash> and skyrim
<RoboGerbil> yeh lots and lots of gears, but i think that has its own designation
<brony2447> lol everyone down in texas (at least where i live) says eeyup its awesome
<Phase4> this sounded very much like tes music
<DeadpoolDash> and oblivion
<doughnutjoe> Oblivion was a bad ass game
<Ninjazz> Phase4, irk. That's what I said a while back.
<BoroBrony> yeah halo 3 was but they left it open and 343 where fans now they own the franchise and they love the chife so they brought him back :)
<Ninjazz> ikr*
<brony2447> BoroBrony: not completely
<RoboGerbil> maybe more like arcanum?
<doughnutjoe> I played oblivion till i got head aches <3
<Jmo> Point stll stands, needs to die.
<Jmo> Burn it with fire.
<BoroBrony> true
<Phase4> NVIDIA!
<brony2447> BoroBrony: they still have o'donell doing the badass music :)
<Phase4> Y YOUR SOFTWARE BROKEN
<AdamTheDuck> Halo was good, but it should have stopped at 3.
<Jmo> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, fuuuuu I'm on my laptop
<BoroBrony> dam right they do y get rid of him
<Jmo> ODST/Reach was just stretching it.
<doughnutjoe> But they had to tie in all the story lines for halo
<BoroBrony> ODST was bad
<RoboGerbil> reach was a very polished shooter
<Jmo> ODST was boring
<BoroBrony> didnt feel like a halo to me
<AdamTheDuck> Reach had a nice ending.
<doughnutjoe> ODST had its charm
<Ninjazz> I personally stoppping liking Halo at the Halo 2.
<Jmo> ^
<brony2447> AdamTheDuck: eeyup....everyone dies :|
<BoroBrony> reach was cool i still play it on my xbox
<Ninjazz> ODST was a Disney Experiment. :/
<Jmo> Ahh I remember the old days of playing on xbox classic.
<DeadpoolDash> ODST reminded me of Halo 1, cause you could die easy if you werent paying attention
<brony2447> BoroBrony: :O add meh!
<AdamTheDuck> brony2447, no no no, instead of a simple cutscene to your uneventful death... You simply play your battle to your death. Genious!
<BoroBrony> i cant waiit for FAR CRY 3 anypony else with me
<Jmo> nop
<Phase4> WINDOWS
<Phase4> YOUR WINDOW MANAGER SUCKS
<BoroBrony> ok add you on what
<brony2447> AdamTheDuck: ahh yes...good point...not to mention how badass it was
<BoroBrony> brony2447 what would you like me to add you on
<brony2447> BoroBrony: xbox live
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, Ping

<doughnutjoe> TES Should stick to single player
<BoroBrony> who is it we are watching on the stream
<Jmo> ;D
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, no, they completely took out what made TES in this MMO.
<Phase4> BoroBrony, Yo
<Ninjazz> No reason to call it TES though. :/
<BoroBrony> yes phase4
<brony2447> doughnutjoe: idk they should at least do a coop
<Jmo> TES sounds like a soccer game I've seen.
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, it could work but they probably screwed it up
<Ninjazz> Hence more, when has Beth EVERY been good at ANY multiplayer game?
<Ninjazz> EVER*
<brony2447> imagine two dovahkiin running around shouting at stuff :)

<Jmo> rate this map 10/10 just for Pikmin implement.
<Ninjazz> AdamTheDuck, in their defence, their games are too masive to keep track of EVERYTHING.
<AdamTheDuck> brony2447, Fallout 3 and New Vegas were buggy as hell
<doughnutjoe> brony2447 all of bethesda's games have been all glitchy and messed up
<BoroBrony> yes very buggy but good
<AdamTheDuck> Haven't too much of Oblivion to come across any major bugs
<Jmo> HOHOHO
<Jmo> BUGS AND GLITCHES
<Jmo> So fun.
<Ninjazz> To the moooooooooooooooon.
<DeadpoolDash> beth is the king of glitches

<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, oh God they take ages to download :<
<Gold_Demona> What class should I be? I'm not good at any of them. XD
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: It randomly gives you one
<Gold_Demona> Oh cool
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: You dont get to pick in arena -lol

<Mega_Milk> Phase4: You guys could REALLY use a medic -lol
<Phase4> and lag prevents scout
<Jmo> He doesn't wanna be helpfull
<Gold_Demona> Heavy sounds fun. I like point and shoot tactic. :D
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Keep in mind
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: You will take incredibly heavy damage from the boss
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: So you will probably be one of the first to die
<Mega_Milk> being slow and all
<AdamTheDuck> Mega_Milk, oh you :$
<Gold_Demona> I'm expecting to be the firs tto die regardless, Mega_Milk. lol XD

<BoroBrony> am gunna try join it now :)
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Good range and you can set traps
<Gold_Demona> Mega_Milk: I'll have to feel my way through all the classes really. Like I said, I'm not very good at any of them.
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Then go soldier
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Really easy to use
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: OR do what most do when they start and go medic
<AdamTheDuck> Phase is playing medic! :<
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: You dont have to learn much and you can be very productive to the team
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, and i did bugger all
<Gold_Demona> lol dem derpy scouts
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Dont let them discourage you! You were mlg as medic >:3
<BoroBrony> i am waiting on the map to load lol
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Firin dem darts! >:3
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, i did bugger all though
<Gold_Demona> dat wrench
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: True. Im not sure what bugger means. But true.
<Gold_Demona> Is that anything like a booger. P:
<Gold_Demona> ?
<Gold_Demona> dat punctuation fail
<AdamTheDuck> To say "Bugger off" means to "go away", so "bugger all" I assume means "eh screw it"
<Gold_Demona> I'll get in someday, lol XD
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Is your PC any good?
<Gold_Demona> Mega_Milk: It's good enough
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: And do you have a nice steady internet connection?
<Gold_Demona> Mega_Milk: Runs other Valve games with no problems
<Jmo> Bugger all means nothing.
<BoroBrony> it means he cant do anything so if you say i can do bugger all to that tank because all i have is a pistol
<Jmo> You aren't Australian AdamTheDuck.
<Gold_Demona> Mega_Milk: Usually. Depends on the internet's mood at the time. Seems to be going good right now

<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Your a lousy shot?
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: I couldve done that now phase :3 -lol
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, come over here to australia and you tell me how easy it is
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: You kept looking at the floor >:3
<Phase4> remember that the boat movment is bugs
<AdamTheDuck> Well I should head off to bed. Goodnight everyone :P
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, LAPTOP MOUSE
*AdamTheDuck noms Phase4

<AdamTheDuck> Thanks for streaming Phase4 :P
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Fair enough fair enough.
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, you come to my house and show me, then i'll belive that i just suck
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Hahahaha! :D no i mean like you kept taking wild goose shots
<Phase4> i was moving the mouse as fast as i can while zoomed
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Some sniper jumped off the boat and versus going for the one standing on the bow you tried to hit him mid jump
<Phase4> my right mouse button is broken
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Oh no
<Phase4> and due to server lag the transition betwene zoom and non zoom is huge
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: You need a working mouse to snipe sir :3
<Phase4> you saw it, the retical bugged
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Yeah it was looking kinda silly. Even for you phase -lol
<Phase4> what i'm actually angry at is the idiot who made the map
<Phase4> all the physics is server side
<Phase4> which is fine if the server and client are on the same machine
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Hahaha XD it looked fun but only if you have a nice balance.
<Phase4> if not, the server yells at the clients untill they update
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: -lol regardless
<Phase4> so my ship was always 250ms behind where it actually was
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: You guys got an ass wupping!
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: -lol yeah I saw. Plus the flying sentry -lol
<Phase4> BECAUSE THE OTHER TEAM WAS NOTHING BUT LOW PING SNIPERS
<Phase4> :<
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: I know I know :3
<Gold_Demona> How'd I do? 8D
<Phase4> its litterally i'm 8 feet away and dead before my client knows i've teleported to the ship
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: -lol in a fair match I know you would have have pwned -lol
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: TERRIBLE! :D
<Gold_Demona> Yay!~
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, well thats not true, i would have held my own though
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Did you even kill anyone?
<Gold_Demona> I don't think so. lol XD
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Yeah on the boat you couldnt even get on deck without getting a helmet full of phase brain soup -lol XD
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: I was jk with ya
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Ya did pretty good
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Saw you fire off a few shots artleast
<Gold_Demona> For newbie XD

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: was it you talking on the stream?
<Gold_Demona> Nope
<Gold_Demona> I don't have my headset plugged in
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: awww, I bet your voice is awesome too :D
<Gold_Demona> I'm really shy. =(
<Gold_Demona> I wouldn't really have much to say anyway
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: You know how to use in game chat right?
<Gold_Demona> Nope
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I'd talk only if people answered back and yell "THERE'S A GUY THERE" :D
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Press "Y" to speak to type to everyone
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Press "U" To talk specifically to your team.
<Gold_Demona> Ooooh. And here I've been banging the enter key trying to get the thing to pop up. XD
<Mega_Milk> Yeah I figured you didnt know how to talk
<Gold_Demona> Cuz that's how it works in all the MMOs I play
<Gold_Demona> Hit enter, then type.
<Mega_Milk> Yeah. But TF2 is in a different world of its own -lol
<Gold_Demona> Here's it's y or u. okie dokie
<Mega_Milk> but hey atleast you got a taste of the action before phase raged :3
<Gold_Demona> lol yeah
<Gold_Demona> I could barely see what Phase was doing. :P
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, I only have the basic weapons and the hats you get from doing the tutorial. XD.
<BoroBrony> :)
<Mega_Milk> yeah your gonna get new weapons just by playing
<Mega_Milk> but to get anything good you either have to have a premium account aka buy something
<Mega_Milk> or trade
<Cypresswolf> well, I got the day off today - and 2 hours sleep
<Gold_Demona> I see
<MadSurge> Trade, I can do that
<MadSurge> Buy, no
<Gold_Demona> Hey, I actually had some kills! =D
<Gold_Demona> My stats says I got two kills
<Gold_Demona> Woo!
<MadSurge> I only buy games :D not virtual objects
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: woo indeed :$
<MadSurge> I sometimes am amazed myself when I get kills
<Gold_Demona> So how does trading work exactly?
<Ryunosuke> http://themittani.com/news/planetside-2-beta-patch-notes --- I know some of you play PS2 :)
<Gold_Demona> Especially since I have pretty much nothing. :P
<MadSurge> I usually have more luck at playing medic/airblasting people to blow flames away or separate ubers :D

<Rev> Well, at least it's quiet right now.

<Cypresswolf> Off, please
<Kammerjunk> Fear me, you lords and lady preachers! I descend upon your Earth from the skies!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Too bad.
<Rev> On
<Rev> Beards are manly
<Kammerjunk> Being a mass of pure Viking (I couldn't type that without laughing), I must agree.
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM50TY9xl2g
<Rev> But it depends if you want to show yourself as high testosterone or not
<Rev> Well
*SpadeMagnes[School] starts throwing tetris blocks into the chat
<Rev> Having enough testosterone to grow facial hair
<Barbetos|AtWork> 8 bit music.

<Kammerjunk> God, I love beards.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Anyone here ever play Doctor Mario?
<Rev> Kammerjunk, you've been here a while, right?
<Kammerjunk> I suppose.
<Iron_Edge> yeah i have it on wii
<Iron_Edge> its basically tetris
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also it is chilly in my house right now....
<Kammerjunk> I'm hardly a veteran, though. Joined a while before S2 aired as an anon.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wish our furnace didnt break....
<Cypresswolf> For those who used to have a beard - http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=xI1rKORTVDs

*SpadeMagnes[School] sets the chat on fire
<Kammerjunk> Not on BronyState.
<Rev> What about on this IRC in general
<Cypresswolf> :D The Beards have another song called "If Your Dad Doesn't Have a Beard, You've Got Two Mums"
<Kammerjunk> Possibly. I don't know, honestly. Wasn't a regular, at any rate.
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmFnarFSj_U&feature=relmfu

<Rev> I like Till Lindermann's voice better
<Rev> I'm waiting until someone that's a mod who knows me possibly kicks me and sets a ban on my current IP address
<Barbetos|AtWork> You know, my dad never taught me how to shave. I debearded thanks to my high school.
<Kammerjunk> My dad doesn't really give a damn.
<Barbetos|AtWork> At first I tried to punch it off.
<Jmo> ..What
<Barbetos|AtWork> What?
<eldudewallaby> hi
<Jmo> Punch your beard off..
<Jmo> How does that even work
<Rev> My dad died before he could teach me
<Rev> But it's not like you need to be taught
<Rev> Pretty straight forward
<MadSurge> That's a Chuck Norris stunt right there Barbetos|AtWork :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Jmo Lets just say the beard survived but my consciousness did not.
<Jmo> You don't say.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh but I do!
<Kammerjunk> What if punched harder, though?
<Kammerjunk> if you*
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well I will let you know in about an hour.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Maybe more

<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Il4VAYYTk0 this is glorius

<NENUDJUS> Dumorimasoddaa: if you round it up
<BoroBrony> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa algebra it hurts my brain
<BoroBrony> :P
<Serenity> Algebra is the most pointless bullcrap evuh
<Gold_Demona> I can andle algebra. It's geometry that gets me.

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Serenity: hell if I know
<Everlasting_Joy> Serenity: It's shorter of course.

<SpadeMagnes[School]> And I live in America
<Serenity> One letter shorter, heh

*SpadeMagnes[School] paints the chat
<Dumorimasoddaa> Then I gave up cos I couldn't be arsed
*Dken2021 was painted!
*Serenity quickly jumps in water and washes off the paint
<Gold_Demona> Serenity: because "maths" sounds retarded?
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[School]: What colors did you use?
<Serenity> Gold_Demona: Maths is plural, therefore it sounds right
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Green,black...
<Serenity> It's probably the other way around, but Math sounds stupid to me :L
<Gold_Demona> I've never heard anybody say "maths" and sound smart saying it. >.>
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Maths sounds stupid
<Gold_Demona> I do MATHS! 8D
<Kammerjunk> "Maths" is acceptable outside the US and Canada.
<Serenity> Btw. Kammerjunk, still play APB?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well it certainly cant sound right in a sentence
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I'm going to do Maths... wut
<Kammerjunk> Serenity: From time to other.
<Kammerjunk> Sounds alright to me, but then again, I'm not used to American English.
<Serenity> Cool. Since I now own a computer capable of maxing anything, I'm gonna download it :]
<NENUDJUS> any one wanna do some Calculus ?
<Serenity> Not used to American English, yeah
<Serenity> I'm used to British English
<Gold_Demona> Understandable.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Maths is weird
<Kammerjunk> Although I am used to Danish accents, and they're just horrendous.
<BoroBrony> yeah british ftw
<Dumorimasoddaa> Cos it's mathatics
<Dumorimasoddaa> Thus a plural
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm going to have to drop off, but it was nice talking with y'all again!
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, I get the grammatical logic behind it, but it still sounds incredibly weird
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: you missed the chat being terrible :D
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, Everlasting_Joy.
<Everlasting_Joy> I should be back a little later.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> bored bored...

<Serenity> Chuck Norris, Arnold Swartzinegger, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone in 1 shot shooting guns and stuff is just priceless
<MadSurge> cachi01|phone: also, House of the Dead zombie and Q-bert :3
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIejbnrHOc - and still have an original working game ^_^
<cachi01|phone> MadSurge didnt see qbert or the house of the dead zombie :o
<Serenity> Madsurge, I have a question, forgive me if I ask this: Do you have a Friend code for 3DS if you own one at all?
<mylittleponylover125> all the ponys are my fav>_>
<MadSurge> cachi01|phone: poor Q-bert is homeless :'( thanks a lot COD
<Cypresswolf> I miss the Ultima series

<Kammerjunk> Alister: That was an excellent choice of game.
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: another series EA successfully ruined
<Alister> Kammerjunk: Thank you

<Cypresswolf> I only have the game boy versions 1 & 2 left
<Serenity> Have you added me, because I added someone here, and I keep forgetting who it is
<Cypresswolf> <3 Black Knight theme
<Serenity> And judging by the name, it sounds similar, Mad, Angry, surge, walk

<Barbetos|AtWork> Wow
<MadSurge> Serenity: I am Bad Surge :D
<Cypresswolf> Eeyup!

<Bronysith> Dken2021: dat seductive derpy
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: why you bored?
<Kammerjunk> I do say, Polydunami looks stylin'.
<Iron_Edge> Seductive derpy you say?? *click*
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kammerjunk, do you have pitctures of /everyone/?
<Cypresswolf> Now that I remember back playing Runes of Virtue 2, The Chalice in the cavern of Selfishness - I only successfully retreived that twice
<Bronysith> i like seductive luna better
<Kammerjunk> ASoftFluffyThing: Well, not /everyone/.
<Kammerjunk> ASoftFluffyThing: I don't think I have a picture of you around.
<Kammerjunk> ...For example.
<Dken2021> do you have pictures of me?
<Kammerjunk> Eenope.
<cachi01|phone> /Everyone/?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kammerjunk, no you don't.
<Kammerjunk> Really, it's mostly the mods.
<Kammerjunk> Ironically, though, I don't have a picture of myself anywhere.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> This chat is about as active as a morgue
<Cypresswolf> You have thsee skeletal knights walking back & forth pushing vases - you're supposed to get through several rows without blocking the doors to the room with floor switches that unlock a series of gates
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: you could always go onto /r/clopclop if you are bored
<Kammerjunk> oh my
<Jmo> ROfl
<cachi01|phone> Well..... More than 100,000 people die a day soooo we can say we are pretty active
<Bronysith> im just sitting here
<Bronysith> watching End of Evangelion
<Bronysith> prepared to tear my face off
<Cypresswolf> the gates at the bottom contain several items, last of which is the Chalice
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The ultimate mindfuck Bronysith ?
<Kammerjunk> I should be doing Java, but instead I'm here, listening to Beethoven and watching chat.
<Iron_Edge> pft beethoven....
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kammerjunk, http://imgur.com/TF9Uu

<Kammerjunk> No, that's just daribot.
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: Wait wait you have actualy pictures of the mods???
<Kammerjunk> Iron_Edge: Sure, who'd you like to see?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> does prince have some program active that does that when ever a new post shows up?
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: Me sir >:3

<Saturn> 08,01and then everything was bees.
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk Sb and shizu
<SpadeMagnes[School]> NOT THE BEES
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hallo Saturn
*Bronysith licks Saturn
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Not the bees ;^;
<cachi01|phone> Saturn NOT TGE BEEDLS
<Dken2021> here's a picture of Morphius http://i.imgur.com/TJZXn.jpg
<MadSurge> Saturn :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> THEY'RE IN MY EYES
<Kammerjunk> cachi01|phone: ...Consarnit. I do have SB - http://derpy.me/fMMGL - but I don't have Shizu.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> AAARGH
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Oh hi, Andrew.
<Cypresswolf> cachi01|phone: that's not even the worst dungeon :)
<Iron_Edge> haha! SB looks so mlg in a suit :3
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk so thats how he looks like
<MadSurge> Shizu is mysterious
<Kammerjunk> SB does look pretty boss.
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: What about mica?
<cachi01|phone> Cypresswolf i must get that game O_O
<Serenity> I've seeb Sumi a few times
<Cypresswolf> Stygian Abyss lvls 1-10 http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585980-ultima-runes-of-virtue-ii/faqs/50691
<Kammerjunk> Hm. I don't reckon I have Sumi 'round here.
<Bronysith> i havent seen sumica
<Kammerjunk> That's a shame.
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: What about......vivi?
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: Or kirz?
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: Or slurry?
<Cypresswolf> Stygian Abyss lvls 11-26 http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585980-ultima-runes-of-virtue-ii/faqs/50692
<Serenity> Kirz isn't a mod anymore :P
<cachi01|phone> He was
<Iron_Edge> Serenity: Shad up! Hes still a mod to me ;^;
<cachi01|phone> ^
<Kammerjunk> Why you gotta ask all these hard questions, man. Finding people is hard!
<Serenity> Kammerjunk: You scare me, matey.
<Cypresswolf> AND THEN - there's a dungeon where you need to play with a friend to make it to the end - never had a friend who could find the game :(
<Serenity> Anyway
<Serenity> Back to the Oreos!
<MadSurge> Iron_Edge: just like Silverscreen :(
<Iron_Edge> MadSurge: Exactly ;^;
<Serenity> Silverscreen still lurks around on Film Nights
*Iron_Edge steals one of Serenity's oreos
<Serenity> To give us all of the facts
<Kammerjunk> With his intriguing trivia.
<Dken2021> I kinda miss Shy being around here
<MadSurge> Yum, oreos
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ Best Part of the game - well, My Personal Favorite - The Texas Cave http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585980-ultima-runes-of-virtue-ii/faqs/50792
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, Shy hasn't been around.
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: what about fluttercry?
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: Or TOM 0.0
<Kammerjunk> Tom. The ultimate prize.
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: Or ghosties
<Tervicz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P1gESvjY6Y&
<Cypresswolf> The Bat Cave is just that - A Bat Cave :D
<Tervicz> ^^
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: Or bacon mane aka lord celestia
<MadSurge> Iron_Edge: fluttercry is still around sometimes
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The chat has come down with dysentery
<Kammerjunk> Oh hell naw. His Baconness scares me.
<Iron_Edge> MadSurge: Yeah Im asking for pictures of them
<Iron_Edge> MadSurge: Im intrested to see what our moderators look like -lol
<Cypresswolf> Bats respawn Eternally
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Goddamned bats
<Kammerjunk> Really, though, I just have Saxy, Scoots, Saturn, SB and Wrek of the mods.
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: And what about phase and scoots?
<Kammerjunk> http://i.imgur.com/ywPRE.jpg - Scoots is on the right.
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: You shall show me saxy then! >:3
<Kammerjunk> Saxy's in the middle.
<Rustymeat> I wanna see newdcd again :(
<Iron_Edge> hahaha dat scoots :3
<Vordox> THEMOVIEBRONY!
<Cypresswolf> The NE cave on that link is the one where you need a 2nd player to get through - never made it past level 2 on my own
<Vordox> NOOOO!
<Iron_Edge> dat saxy too :D
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Pardon?
<Iron_Edge> hahaha
<Iron_Edge> nice
<Dken2021> Rustymeat yea, I miss him and that dog of his
<Vordox> TheMovieBrony is taking a hiatus. :(
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know.
<cachi01|phone> Cypresswolf so its impossible to complete the game in a ROM
<Iron_Edge> I know what wrek looks like with his baws shades on. I know what Saturn looks like because I really like his mane and I knwo what SB looks like because he is baws in a suit.
<Cypresswolf> I know you can send a rescued mayor through, but if they die, you're screwed - they dont respawn and the game is over
<cachi01|phone> Wow...tough game is tough
<Cypresswolf> you need all 8 runes to open Stygian Abyss
<Kammerjunk> Iron_Edge: Oh, but have you seen http://test.du.cx/pics/IPw9RR.png
<Kammerjunk> Really, though, I'm jelly of those books.
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: Ohhhh mai~
<Kammerjunk> I want those books, man.
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: Hahahahahaha XD nice shot -lol
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Very smexeh
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk i remember when saturn posted that here :D
<Iron_Edge> dat sexy Saturn is sexy XD
<Dken2021> you sure like to archive things Kammerjunk
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk is twilight?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kammerjunk, uh..........
<Kammerjunk> I spend hours on end organising and archiving stuff.
<Iron_Edge> ASoftFluffyThing: Nice shot right? :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> Iron_Edge, YES.
<BladedWings> Kammerjunk: who is that again?
<Kammerjunk> BladedWings: That's Saturn.
<Cypresswolf> I forgot about the ships in the game :) There are a limited supply, so if you go around and destroy them all - Game Over
<BladedWings> Kammerjunk: oh my~
<BaconMane> 0,5Aw, no moar Hammer time
<Dken2021> BaconMane ;_;
*SpadeMagnes[School] gives BaconMane a new hammer
<CrimsonPhoenix> BaconMane, you want hammer time?
<Kammerjunk> Halt! Hammerzeit.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can start capslocking for you
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello, BaconMane

<BladedWings> BaconMane: awwww

<BaconMane> 0,5do-dododo-do-DO-do-DO-do
*BaconMane swings about
*ASoftFluffyThing moves out of the path of the Golden Hammer
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: http://imgur.com/Ec00s

<cachi01|phone> VenHur PUSSY. Level 9 MLG's play with no items fox only final destination!
<Dken2021> huh, I think I hear squeaking
*SpadeMagnes[School] grabs a golden hammer
<Iron_Edge> Kammerjunk: They call me prisoner number 5555500000 :3
<VenHur> ...What?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wombo combo
<Cypresswolf> *goes back to playing Harvest Moon: Sunshine Islands* ^_^ Gonna raise an island
<Kammerjunk> Iron_Edge: Yay! Pictures for the picture god!

<Iron_Edge> ASoftFluffyThing: No its my sister! >:3
<Iron_Edge> ASoftFluffyThing: Of course its me>:3

<Iron_Edge> ASoftFluffyThing: -lol Liokin needs him a Liokin-shave :3
<cachi01|phone> Iron_Edge ur sister looks oooh dammit Dken2021
<Cypresswolf> I've been looking for Earthbound Mother, but cant find a copy that doesnt involve buying it online *shrugs*
<Iron_Edge> Dken2021: Hahah XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Iron_Edge, are you Liokin?
<VenHur> The only Harvest Moon game I ever had is A Wonderful Life and the other one with a more chibi-like style.
<Iron_Edge> ASoftFluffyThing: Eeyup :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> You were Mega_Milk yesterdaaaay~
<VenHur> That one with the whole goddess crap going on...
<Iron_Edge> ASoftFluffyThing: Aka mega milk :3
<cachi01|phone> Cypresswolf i have to play it on an emulator
<MadSurge> Well, gotta go to the pool guys! See you later!
*SpadeMagnes[School] hits a smash ball
<Iron_Edge> ASoftFluffyThing: eeyup :3
<cachi01|phone> Cya MadSurge :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye MadSurge. Don't drown!
<Dken2021> are you talking about that NES copy?
<Iron_Edge> MadSurge: If you drown.....;^; Ill be sad...
*VenHur hears the Sonic drowning music
<VenHur> ...Too late...
<Iron_Edge> MadSurge: And ill go on an uncontrolable rampage >:3
<BladedWings> bye MadSurge
<VenHur> Bye MadSurge...
<Dken2021> have fun MadSurge
<Cypresswolf> VenHur: Ever play the RPG version ...what was it? Rune Factory
*SpadeMagnes[School] gets 50 rings and jumps into a special stage
<VenHur> Cypresswolf: Um...no?
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Have fun! Hope a malevolent entity doesn't remove the ladders!
<Kammerjunk> I've been playing too much MurderSim lately.
<Kammerjunk> Sims*
<Saturn> 08,01oh oh! one of my favourite grimdark stories has just been updated!
<Saturn> 08,01wheeee!
*SpadeMagnes[School] got a Chaos Emerald
<Saturn> 08,01reading time...
*Bronysith murders SpadeMagnes[School]
<VenHur> Hi Saturn.
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Fan service! and you left me out! >:3 http://test.du.cx/pics/IPw9RR.png
<Kammerjunk> Oh! I didn't know you were there.
<Kammerjunk> Awkward.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still had rings
<Cypresswolf> VenHur: the 1st one I highly recommend - you're still doing the farm thing, but you also get to fight monsters in dungeon - there are fields you can grow food in the dungeons where its 1 season all the time. the weather wont effect them and not watering for awhile doesnt kill them
*SpadeMagnes[School] runs
<cachi01|phone> Saturn whats the name of the fic?
*Razyn can never figure out what pings him in this channel
<Kammerjunk> Razyn
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why was I "murdered"
<Razyn> heh
*cachi01|phone touches SpadeMagnes[School]
<Cypresswolf> The 2nd game however - too much going on - if there are 6 or more town folk in one area, youre game lags, also the raining confetti or flowers makes the game lag worse when there are too many people >_<
<cachi01|phone> There now u have 0 rings
<VenHur> You know you have a console named after you, right?
*SpadeMagnes[School] grabs a ring
*VenHur holds up a Sega Saturn.
*SpadeMagnes[School] holds up a Sega Genesis
<Kammerjunk> You know you have a plenet named after you, right?
<VenHur> You should feel proud of yourself...
<Kammerjunk> planet*
<cachi01|phone> Ur anus?
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<ASoftFluffyThing> You know you have a car brand named after you, right?
*ASoftFluffyThing holds up the Saturn car logo thing
*SpadeMagnes[School] gets another Chaos Emerald
<Dken2021> This grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says: "Hey, we have a drink named after you."
<ASoftFluffyThing> And a Sailor Scout
<VenHur> It's too bad the Sega Saturn sucked though...Though Sonic R was decent.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> A man walks into a bar
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ouch
<VenHur> And damnit, I wants to play Sonic Xtreme...IF IT WAS RELEASED!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sonic Riders..woo
<Serenity> Soup cabbage
<cachi01|phone> sonic riders....yeah...woohoo.........
<Dken2021> there's always sonic robo 2
<Serenity> 2.5gb/4.6 gb downloaded
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sonic Genesis, best GAME EVER
<SpadeMagnes[School]> :P
<cachi01|phone> VenHur dont mention sonic R
<Serenity> Taken around 1.2 hours, wish it would hurry up
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And then theres...Sonic 06
<VenHur> What? Because of...oh dear god, HE'S behind me isn't he?
<cachi01|phone> VenHur RUN
*VenHur runs for mercy
<SpadeMagnes[School]> From what?
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes from It...
*SpadeMagnes[School] smacks It with a steel pipe
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes He is invincible
<cachi01|phone> He will eat ur soul
<Derpy_at_work> Sonic Adventure 2 is best sonic game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I doubt he can eat a cyber program
<cachi01|phone> Not the best. But its fun
<VenHur> I thought Sonic 3 and Knuckles was THE best...well...of the Genesis games actually.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The lip syncing could use work
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes dont question the doll
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The modles were built for the japanese actors...the americans got lazy
<VenHur> I hates the 4Kids Tails voice...sounds more girly and all that crap....
<Gold_Demona> VenHur: I agree, except I'd call it the best in the whole franchise
<VenHur> ^
<Gold_Demona> VenHur: S3&K that is
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You know what was stupid about Sonic's Sega genesis collection for the 360?
<VenHur> So, let's take a little retrospective in my personal views.
*Panda slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They didnt put Sonic 3 and K together because of apperent "space limitations"
<Panda> Morning Bstate!!!
<Bronysith> sonic is a terrible series anyways
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I call bullshit
<VenHur> Sonic 1, what can I say? It's freaking Sonic The Hedgehog, go figures.
<cachi01|phone> Morning Panda :)
<VenHur> But yeah...it's a classic.
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: That's just cuz you're Mister Judgey McJudgementalpants
<Panda> :) cachi01|phone, why you always on the phone?
<Dken2021> soace limitations? on a 360?
<Bronysith> well hang on
<Bronysith> Sonic Adventure 2 battle was awewomes
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What fucking space limitations could there be on a 360 disc by putting the two games together\
<cachi01|phone> Panda right now. My mom is using el shitbox soooo lol
<Panda> cachi01|phone XD
<Dken2021> especially when they only take up to about 4-8 mb
<Bronysith> hello Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> SpadesMagnes[School] It's not so much putting the two games together as it is putting a whole other game on there.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And then they rereleased the game with it on there!
<Gold_Demona> SpadesMagnes[School] That's twice as long as the other two.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Except it was limited if I recall
<VenHur> Sonic 2, what's probally everyone's favorite Sonic game, for me, I seen better.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But whats the point of putting all the games and not the whole thing
<Dken2021> it was my favorite for sure
<Gold_Demona> I love Sonic 2.
<Gold_Demona> It's my second favorite
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sonic Jam's easy mode is pathetic
<VenHur> It's WOULD of been my favorite...it is haven't been for that Mystic Cave Zone Super Sonic glitch...
<Gold_Demona> Sonic 3 & Knuckles is my top favorite
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How many hits does the Death Egg Robo take?
<cachi01|phone> Sonic.CD has best hidden messages
<Dken2021> 8 if I remember
<Gold_Demona> I've never had any glitchy problems with Super Sonic. O_o
<Applejack2012> I loved Sonic 3 too
<VenHur> Sonic 3 alone, It's better, more faster, and it's the first to feature good ol' Knucklehead.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sonic jam's easy mode kills it in 3 Dken2021
<Kammerjunk> God, I love Italian food.
<Bronysith> sonic 3 was pretty much win
