<OohShiny> well, I watched Wall-E too many times anyway
<Stopwatch> cause tomorrow spring is here
<otakon> his computer is 5 years old
<Dashes> NEEDED MOAR GAK
<Kammerjunk> Fun fact: Within the first 5 minutes, you heard a monologue through the billboards. 22 minutes into the film, the first dialogue was heard. The first human dialogue in this film began 39 minutes in.
<Polydunami> Thanks, J_E_Smith71
<oni_link> J_E_Smith71: great choice if I say so myself
<CCharmanderK> J_E_Smith71: You can never go bad with a PIXAR film.
<leafeonglare0> what will be happening next friday since there is no new episode?
<Neotyguy40> There are infinite number of ways to prove it as well
<Stopwatch> and as things fell apart
<Dark92Enigma> THE Enigma's review of WALL-E: This movie is just brilliant. There are many little things in the film that have so much meaning to them. There are things that will be nostalgic to older viewers, and things that younger viewers will love to look at. However, it does steer for the cheesy, cliché aspects of a child's film, yet still remaining a completely G-rated film. The Characters, especcially WALL-E and EVE are charming and lovabl
<weeping_pegasi82> he got the twinkie!
<otakon> and he REFUSES to let me run maintenance on it
<Color_Cloud> HAS EVA AND WALL-E BEEN PONIFIED YET?
<CrystalPhoenix> CCharmanderK, Cars 2
<Shrimp> Everyone loves wall-e
<Spyrorocks> Talking about mod applications Stormy ....
<Stopwatch> nopony paid much attention
<Conyst> J_E_Smith71: It's hard to hate Wall-E
<Somberguy20> shizuka is there a reason that you dont stream movies that are less than 1 year old?
<Life_Essence> Still a better love dotry than Twilight. By leaps and/or bounds
<Life_Essence> *story
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Just tell him you're removing viruses.
<PonyIshBest> see Bjornfot otakon just said something
<Dark92Enigma> Other than that, restores faith in the animation films. It captures the magic and wonder as past Disney films, which is something I have not seen in most modern animation films. 10/10
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, really? My perpetual pick for B movie is less than a year old.
<otakon> his drive is 35% framented
<AttackWithHugs> Color_Cloud: Possibly.
<Kammerjunk> Laymen hate viruses.
<Spyrorocks> Some like 2 post members would PM me asking me for "admin"
<CCharmanderK> CrystalPhoenix: That was a good movie that gets too much shit.
<scout19_tf2> wuts next
<Doctor> J.E.Smith71: I love you.

<VenHur> I checked the survey's page, nothing was there. > I am disapoint
<Polydunami> Provided it's suitable, OperatorPony
<GabeMoist> Not the Patron Saint of Bustah Wolfing?
<Stormy> or if it's the choir I was in that year
<pony27245> Hey this is my first time ever using this site, I just marathon watched mlp seasons 1&2 and I just wanted to say this site is really cool

<Cirno> what is suitable?
<Dark92Enigma> This reminds me, i gotta sing Dangerzone in spanish
<Soviet_Schmuck> No
<Kandarihu> CrystalPhoenix, then it would've happened earlier.
<Kammerjunk> otakon17: Completely worth it.
<killerpony7733> Polydunami Also you need a account for adult material which most here doubtfully have so it's not a worry tbh.
<Punkie_Pue> can we vote for movies with rift tracks or was that special for the titanic?
<Stormy> ...wait, this was 2010
<otakon17> Yeah maybe
<Stormy> XD
<Stormy> never mind

<Dark92Enigma> alexxm|colt: Sonic Rainboom, Kung-fu-hustle, and Stare Master
<Punkie_Pue> welcome to the herd
<Kammerjunk> Programs... Programs never change.
<AttackWithHugs> Tried comparing computers to vehicles? They both change

<Midnight_Fyre> otakon17: It's not that bad according to IMDb
<richfiles> Waiting for Sumi to reset before we get trolled by a bad /b/ movie
<Shizuka> 13worldedit has //drain but i don't think you can get worldedit with forge server
<VenHur> Okay, nickname contest time, today we have a newbie named pony27245, So I asked the modderators and everpony else a favor, give him the best name you can think of, it doesn't had to be THE best, just any.
<richfiles> :D
<Ta_Dikin> B Movie: Christmas Do-Over
<wipergone2> SuperBrony64: hi
<Aplecrisp62> Whos goi
<CrystalPhoenix> Yahooz, My picked of The king's speech was purely because of that background music in Lesson Zero
<AttackWithHugs> otakon17: Yes, encoder crashed on Sumica's end
<CrystalPhoenix> fun fact
<sonicdude558> I think that no guy hacked the stream
<J_E_Smith71> Sinestro: Yes it just crashed they're getting it fixed
<Aplecrisp62> who goin to watch Spike at your Service?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh well
<Shizuka> 13i have a limited version on now but it doesn't have 90% of worldedit's abilities
<AJ> Fix it fix it fix it fix it ... fix it fix it fix it
<Axadentel> welp
<Kandarihu> I think I vaguely remember Christmas Do-Over. Really vaguely.
<Kammerjunk> Wait, you can't?
<J_E_Smith71> Aplecrisp62: Everyone here
<Darf14> I can Fix It!
<Kammerjunk> Huh.

<Dashes> (not really D:)
<Axadentel> brb
<Havok> Do you mean the tekkit server?
<Yahooz> CrystalPhoenix: And I picked 21 as an A movie because i thought it would be a nice pick.
<DerpyMuffins> Can we fix it?
<Punkie_Pue> http://s647.beta.photobucket.com/user/lovekakumei/media/futurama-fixit.gif.html
<J_E_Smith71> Kandarihu: I think its based off an already existing story
<Yahooz> fun fact
<Conyst> I CAN FIX IT
<Dashes> DerpyMuffins: YES WE CAN
<Aplecrisp62> no we cant
<Shizuka> 13there was once a compatibility plugin between bukkit and forge, but bukkit sent a huge FU to the forge devs that were maintaining it
<AJ> Can we fix it!?
<Thunderlane343> So whats this next movie about? 6_9
<Aplecrisp62> NO we cant
<Stormy> I wonder what happened to Kjakings
<Ta_Dikin> You Can Do it Derpy!!!!
<thelonecubone> no
<Shizuka> 13so it's a scrambled effort to get forge some useful server plugins
<Stormy> He would have loved you, Meth
<pony27245> VenHur: Hey, so can you make accounts here?
*MadScientIsht sends Bjornfot to otakon17
<OperatorPony> is there suppose to be no sound right now?
<Darf14> Might as well play the Pony Ap game while I wait
<Shizuka> 13the only worldedit ability i have atm is being able to select a region and either set it to a block or replace a block with another
<Kammerjunk> Fairly certain my Tekkit server is running WorldEdit. Might be an old version, I guess.
<Sinestro> i missed the A-movie damn it, got sucked into Sins of a Solar Empire
<TheMoon17> Hes encoder crashed
<Shizuka> 13tekkit is bukkit
<Shizuka> 13FTB is forge
<Havok> Shizuka: I tried with full worldedit on a tekkit server, it works ;)
<J_E_Smith71> OperatorPony: Yeah no sound cause we crashed, we're working on getting it back up
<Kammerjunk> Ah, FTB. Never really got into that.
<Badger> D'AAAW!
*Bjornfot holds otakon17

<Kammerjunk> Mostly because I couldn't figure out what the hell 'it' is.
<Punkie_Pue> pony27245 you change your name with /nick

<Rex_Ivan> this movie is called "Father in Law is a Dick"
<Midnight_Fyre> Kammerjunk: There is a story on Yahoo today. Apparently some lady discovered that stuff made in Chinese slave labor camps is being sold in the US. The more I look into it the more it seems to be accurate. I don't think it's a very large number of the CHinese made goods here, but it is happening and there is no way to really tell if the stuff you buy is coming from a legit factory or a forced labor camp
<oni_link> lol
<Welsh_Pony> Run!
<Cirno> eww
<Luna911> eeeewwwww

<AlienWarhead> I AM AN ADULT
<J_E_Smith71> No this is based off of an old Christmas story written in the 1890s. I saw some plays and animations of this story when I was a kid in the 80s
<Kammerjunk> Oh. Yeah, sorry to spoil it, but that's not a lie.
<Midnight_Fyre> The whole idea of possibly having stuff made by virtual slaves in horrible conditions is kinda eating away at me right now
<Contron> DEFINATELY National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation!

<OohShiny> Rewind

<Darf14> to be honest, I would be scared it the same day repeated
<Dashes> twilight_sprinkle: still, needs moar Majora
<Anger> SAY YES
<Anger> do it kid
<Raritydiamond> i wonder Tod doesn;t notice it even though HE is the one who wished for it:)
<VenHur> Oooh, I get it, this is one of those "Life repeats until you learn the meaning of life" type of movie!
<Welsh_Pony> Do it!
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica: as far is i know, this movie is a remake of a short of the same name back in the 80's
<Thunderlane343> Falcon punch!
<Anger> XD

<Nyst> pony_9830: there'll be a rerun tomorrow.
<Dark92Enigma> Conyst: I was looking for info about this flick
