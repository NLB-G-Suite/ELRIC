<ZIP> video stopped?
<Fl00t4sh41> And I'm the only male grandchild or available relative
<twilight_sprinkle> yes ZIP
<Vivix> roped into carry stuff Fl00t4sh41 ?
<Fl00t4sh41> Vivix: Basically
<Pinkielover123> Great.
<Fl00t4sh41> Bloody family obligations
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Aah~~ will you miss the premiere?
<Pinkielover123> My least fave MLP episode is on.
<Areus> No excuse, you will be here. You. Will.
<ZIP> okay.jpg
<Pinkielover123> I sure wont.
<Fl00t4sh41> Vivix: It's a shame but I think I'll survive
<MisterBull82> one simply does not miss a MLP episode
<Vivix> yeah~~ it'll be all over the net to catch later
<Fl00t4sh41> Vivix: That's my thought
<twilight_sprinkle> inb4 site crashes due to overload anyway
<Vivix> in that case I will scurry to the other stream site <,<
<MisterBull82> or trololols raiding the site
<twilight_sprinkle> and then it comes back right at the end of th eepisode
<twilight_sprinkle> so it spoils
<Pinkielover123> xD
<Fl00t4sh41> twilight_sprinkle: That's part of the fun, isn't it?
<Pinkielover123> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG-DTvmo6GY&feature=related
<Areus> The chat will just create a wormhole because of non stop spamming and we all will perish. Like the maya guys already figured out.
<Gold_Demona> Oh geez, Parappa had a cartoon series? XD
<MisterBull82> 2012... its true
<Vivix> 2012, because of ponies
<Fl00t4sh41> Areus: Isn't that the 21st of may or december though?
<Areus> The wormhole need some time to grow.
<Gold_Demona> The Mayans predicted pony apocalypse
<Pinkielover123> Yes/
<Pinkielover123> He's getting a tv show on CN in 2013.
<Fl00t4sh41> Who is?
<Vivix> Parappa?
<Pinkielover123> Yup.
<Gold_Demona> Parappa the Rapper
<Gold_Demona> It was a video game on PS1
<Zamer> very good video game*
<Pinkielover123> I don't want to watch this show.
<Pinkielover123> I mean episode.
<Pinkielover123> So excuse me while i'll try to beat the bathroom rap.
<MisterBull82> they need to bring back the old Spyro and give him his own telly show xD
<Vivix> Ooo Spyro
<Vivix> that adorable dragon
<Pinkielover123> WRECK IT RALPH
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Everlasting_Joy :)
<Zamer> is the stream still down?
<MisterBull82> the new one.. is.. well.. meh..... not bad.. but its just not Spyro.. as I knew him
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Everlasting_Joy
<Fl00t4sh41> MisterBull82: The version that had an actualy story or the original?
<ZIP> soo, what about video?
<Everlasting_Joy> Pinkielover123: no no no, it's "Wreck-it Wrek".
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy MLP_Brovakiin and Gold_Demona!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> huh Parappa anime? neat lol bunch of japanese then AMERICAN DREAM :D love japan!
<Gold_Demona> MisterBull82, I know exactly what you mean.
<Pinkielover123> :D
<Pinkielover123> No no no.
<Pinkielover123> Ralph.
*Pearly hugs Gold_Demona
<Pinkielover123> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=408vPQe69GM&feature=related
<Gold_Demona> MisterBull82, Legend of Spyro had a lot of things that were better than the original Spyro, but all in all, the original Spyro had better games.
<Pinkielover123> Spyro.
<Pinkielover123> Spike.
<Gold_Demona> MisterBull82, I think the newer Spyro would've faired better as a series of movies than a game series.
<Vivix> I remember way too little of the original games
<Pinkielover123> Spikero.
<Everlasting_Joy> Pinkielover123: Wrek.
<MisterBull82> @gold agreed
<Pinkielover123> I've seen art of spike meeting spyro.
<Pinkielover123> SonDash is just...
<Pinkielover123> what
<MisterBull82> but ah well.. things change.. evolve. they either get better or get worst
<Gold_Demona> MisterBull82, The gameplay was kinda meh (except for the third game cuz infitie flying FTW)
<Pinkielover123> Guys.
<Jmo> infitie~
<Pinkielover123> SonDash.
<Gold_Demona> MisterBull82, The games themselves were WAY too short
<MisterBull82> aye
<Pinkielover123> Skylanders.
<Gold_Demona> MisterBull82, BUT, the story was pretty kickass.
<Pinkielover123> I love that game.
<MisterBull82> indeed :)
<pony_painter_360> hi guys
<Fl00t4sh41> never did see skylanders, wasn't it an mmo or somesuch?
<Gold_Demona> Skylanders does not count as a Spyro game. It's an awesome action-figure game that happens to have Spyro's image tacked onto it to make it sell better.
<BladedWings|HW> hi pony_painter_360
<MisterBull82> no, it was a single player game with a toy gimmik
<Gold_Demona> I happen to like the toy gimmick. ._.
<Pinkielover123> I didn't say it was a spyro game.
<pony_painter_360> hey bladed wings
<MisterBull82> oh, its cool, dont get me wrong
<pony_painter_360> :3
<Pinkielover123> That's the best idea ever.
<MisterBull82> but a gimmick is a gimmick, ya know?
<Pinkielover123> Putting toys on a thingy and they appear in the game.
<Gold_Demona> Yeah.
<Gold_Demona> I would've been ALL over that as a kid.
<Gold_Demona> I'd have ALL the figures
<Fl00t4sh41> Pinkielover123: How does this improve the game?
<rain_runner> candy candy candy
<MisterBull82> well... we had The power glove.. and Rob to keep us busy ^^;;;
<Pinkielover123> I said that's the best idea.
<pony_painter_360> pinkielover123 hi
<Fl00t4sh41> Seem to me like its just a cheap ploy to sell tons of useless crap
<Pinkielover123> Hi.
<rain_runner> hi
<pony_painter_360> :D
<Gold_Demona> Funny, I had a nintendo as a kid, but never knew about the powerglove or rob until recently.
<MisterBull82> I predict that the pony craze could evolve into a sort of Pokemon knockoff with videogame toy gimmick
<Pearly> Hah skylanders sounds like a pokemon kind of game
<Pinkielover123> Jammer Lammy reminds me of fluttershy,maybe it's because she is shy.
<Pinkielover123> We need a shrug emote.
<pony_painter_360> i will attack you with squees
<pony_painter_360> :)
<MisterBull82> FLUTTERSHY GOOOO!!!!
<pony_painter_360> !
<Pearly> Gold_Demona, I had a friend who had both of those, but I am an old, yet looking young kinda mare :D

<MisterBull82> I want to be a rock.
<Gold_Demona> Robots are cool!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai pony_painter_360
<pony_painter_360> hai all
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yes they are :)
<Gold_Demona> Pneumatics rule!
<Pearly> A, ROCKLOBSTER MisterBull82?

*Pearly hugs Pinkielover123 "it's ok dear,me neither"
<Gold_Demona> Pinkielover123, This is what happens when there's no stream and we're left to our own devices. We go into random fits of randomness. :P
<MisterBull82> PinkieLover: its a chatroom.. its a window into the most deep recesses of the human mind
<MadSurge> :O Pearly! Where have you been? :)
<Pinkielover123> All of a sudden people reply to me.

<pony_117988> *everypony
<pony_117988> hallo
<MadSurge> Het TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
<pony_117988> I am incredibly hyped for season 3
<BladedWings|HW> good morning TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<MisterBull82> so... who wants to bet $5 that there'll be some kinda hybrid of the sea pony in this season?
<pony_painter_360> hello everpony what u think season 3 will be like
<pony_117988> Well, there can't really be any spoilers :/
<Pinkielover123> My.
<Pinkielover123> Pony.
<pony_painter_360> caus we waited neck end of a year for it
<Pinkielover123> ^
<pony_painter_360> all i say is
<pony_painter_360> ...
<Moopy> Ha i found it
<pony_painter_360> sea ponies do u think?
<MisterBull82> Micheal Bay will pick up the license for the movie.. and it will simply be called "Pony." the period included
<pony_painter_360> :)
<Pinkielover123> SHOO BE DOO
<MadSurge> MisterBull82: and instead of lasers unicorns will shoot explosions
<MisterBull82> there will be asplosions, and pointless car chases an more asplosios and random sexy human chick and asplosions
<Pinkielover123> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4357/ I don't know who she is,but she looks sexy.
<Pinkielover123> xD
<Areus> Don't you know Zone tan?
<Pinkielover123> Ahem.
<Gold_Demona> MisterBull82, sexy mare washing her motorcycle?
<MisterBull82> eeyep
<Gold_Demona> And then the motorcycle gets chased and asplodes
<Pinkielover123> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3332/
<MadSurge> Indeed Gold_Demona
<MisterBull82> but then Uwe Bolle will take up the license for the sequel
<MisterBull82> and have badly done zombies invade a toy miniature set of Equestria
<Pinkielover123> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1684/
<Gold_Demona> MisterBull82, So suddenly it's a japanese sentai? O_o
<MisterBull82> that year, Hasbro will go bankrupt, and everybody would had moved on to the newer more improved Barney the Epic TRex series
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Pinkielover123> What?
<MisterBull82> lol
<Areus> There will be people in pony costumes fighting across a tokyo cardboard model. Just like the old godzilla movies.
<Pinkielover123> I can tell a vison.
<MisterBull82> Uwe Bolle will claim to have been inspired by the artistic style of the older japanese monster films. and it would be a bold faced lie... like always
<Pinkielover123> Season 3 will be awesome!~

<jbh1145> is anything playing on the stream, cause it isnt loading

<Gold_Demona> Nope. No stream
<jbh1145> soooooo season 3 :D

<Pinkielover123> o.o
<Gold_Demona> There is a stream... It's the BUFFER SHOW! 8D
<MisterBull82> there's a nearby cow pasture there.. it might have ponies in it
<Gold_Demona> That buffer show
<Pearly> haha
<Gold_Demona> It's my favorite show
<Pinkielover123> Buffer show!
<Pinkielover123> I hate that show.
<MisterBull82> the wheel keeps on spinning
<Gold_Demona> And this is my favorite episode too. It's the one where the buffer circle chases its tail. :D
<MisterBull82> spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and...
<Gold_Demona> You spin me right round baby, right round
<MisterBull82> oh god...
<Jmo> Like a merry go rond.
<Pinkielover123> And wondering.
<Jmo> round*
<jbh1145> im not commander shepard and this is not my favorite show on the nonexisint citadel
<Pearly> yo dawg, I heard you like to buffer, so I gave you something to watch while it buffers, as it buffers
<Pearly> :D
<MisterBull82> everytime I hear that song, I picture that one video with Chris Chan twirling in place buck nekkid x.x

<Pinkielover123> No stream.
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBULa6RUa-c&feature=plcp
<Pinkielover123> Na da.
<MisterBull82> cachi: eeyep
<Thundercracker> MLP forums is streaming atm
<Thundercracker> music at least
<cachi01> meh
<cachi01> theres no stream like a bronystate stream
<Thundercracker> haha true true
<Thundercracker> except there isn't one atm.... :(
<MisterBull82> I'll never forget.... the day Derpy was named... and talked
<Uncle> My stream isnt loading
<Thundercracker> Ha! chat blew up
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBULa6RUa-c&feature=plcp
<Uncle> After the ad goes away I just have a perpetual circle
<Pinkielover123> Yup.
<Pinkielover123> The day when derpy talked.
<MisterBull82> I was there. it was an epic day
<Pinkielover123> Was the day when my life was complete.
<MisterBull82> but then... some troll ruined it for us all
<Thundercracker> but what if....she talks again Pinkielover?? What then?
<MisterBull82> oh god.. I remember the chaos! it was so terrible! *cringes*
<Vivix> I don't remember the chaos- but I remember her talking
<Vivix> She sounded VERY boyish
<Jim> ohai
<Coolbond> yo
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBULa6RUa-c&feature=plcp
<Thundercracker> hello Jim
<killerpony7733> jbh1145 You should stop spamming that link
<Pinkielover123> If she talks again.
<MisterBull82> the chaos came shortly after the heavenly event... they edited it all out because of some trolls complaining
<Pinkielover123> BOOM HEADSHOY
<Vivix> well yeah I remember complaints from some people
<Pwah> Anything showing?
<Pinkielover123> *Headshot
<Rougth> holy doly holy doly holy
<Rougth> EQD timer had ran out!
<Pinkielover123> Can i kill some trolls?
<jbh1145> ok
<Vivix> but didn't they just revoice her has female and edit the dialog a bit?
<jbh1145> ill stop
<Rougth> Just this second!
<Rougth> AHAHAHAA
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Top 10 Pony Videos of October
<MisterBull82> they did.. and they also removed her name
<killerpony7733> MisterBull82 I think you got a wrong impression of what trolls are. Trolling itself is a art form you don't do it to upset people or insult them. But to make some situations awkward and funny. Insulting and ruining shit for others is not trolling FYI
<Vivix> pity about the removal of name- but I think revoicing her as female was good
<jbh1145> derpy talking was beast
<killerpony7733> Theres a difference between being funny and humorous and a douchebag
<MisterBull82> killer: lol, I know what a troll is. I'm just trying to make this sound all ... dramatic-ish xD
<Vivix> trolling is often sadistic though
<Vivix> so no I don't think that's right
<Pinkielover123> Whenever we talk about derpy talking,we get into fights.
<MisterBull82> its sad, really
*Vivix has no strong feelings in one direction
<Vivix> I like derpy, but I've never heard her new voice
<killerpony7733> MisterBull82 Eh you may end up giving people a wrong impression and uninformed on the matter
<MisterBull82> I'm straight up pro Derpy
<Thundercracker> ahhh its got the Two Best Sisters in it...LOVE IT
<rdash> 6899 is getting annoying...
<Vivix> but I thouht she was too male sounding in the original
<cachi01> whoever linked that friendship equal magic....thx :D
<Thundercracker> I never gave her a voice before she talked so anything fit for me
<Vivix> technically same here
<MisterBull82> @killerpony: noted. :P sorry bout that. I'll blame it on the fact I've been up since 11 last night xP
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.

<Pinkielover123> MY LITTLE PONY
<Pinkielover123> I USED TO WONDER WHAT FRIENDSHIP COULD BE
<MisterBull82> so.. who else is going to paint their walls pink and purple, add sparkles and hearts and doodles of poni poni poni poni and play pony songs just loud enough to irritate their neighbors?
<PonySwagg> You have no idea, Socks
<jbh1145> what do yyou think of littiest pet shop?
<Socks> Deacon: I know, we will not be able to see the chat

<pony_6253> tommorow, the entire internet will crash.
<jbh1145> are male fans gonna be called pet shopies?
<PonySwagg> Bah, I'll turn the stream of once ponies are done.
<MisterBull82> jbh: pups would be fitting, actually
<Socks> There should be a seperate chat for the people who just like hanging on BronyState... like me ¬_¬
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: http://derpy.me/qxLea :)
<MisterBull82> as for male carebear fans? just bears
<Malmortius> Guys, opinions on the best song in MLP? Theres just something about love is in bloom :C
<Deacon> Socks there is, but it's a secret to everybody
<jbh1145> idk
<Socks> Deacon: :O
<jbh1145> best song idk
<PonySwagg> Love Is In Bloom makes you like a style of music that you normally wouldn't like
<Vivix> just look at the channel-list
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: party alligator! :3
<Socks> Deacon: I'm not everybody, I like secrets!
<Vivix> I won't be on the chat during the episodes, probably
<Ninjazz> Sssssssshhhhhhhhh. damnit. I like it quiet there.
*Socks talks like a 3year old
<Zamer> Secrets? ooooh spill
<PonySwagg> Okay, I'm gonna leave for a bit, BRB
<PonySwagg> <3
<MisterBull82> whoever posts last in this chat has to print out a whole buncha pony propaganda images and cram them in their neighbors mailbox...
<Zamer> as long as it's not a royal secret
<Deacon> I have to work tomorrow, and I get off like an hour after the premeire
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: :D wait until tomorrow
<jbh1145> this:
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mib66D-UH_w
<Kammerjunk> MisterBull82: Deal. I don't like my neighbor anyway.
<Zamer> what if said neighbors don't have mailboxes
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, the madness. I had forgetten all about it these past months.
<Vivix> People exist without mailboxes?
<Kammerjunk> MisterBull82: Wait, when is 'last'?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: Ikr
<MisterBull82> Zamer: then you eliver the material..... personally

<Socks> The chat moves so fast! It's making me tense, I'm beginning to hyperventilate!
<Deacon> like I said, wait until tomorrow
<Kammerjunk> Socks: Oh, this is slow compared to tomorrow.
<Invi> Socks, wait until the episode...
*Socks dies due to being an introvert
<Zamer> damn i wish the GL sale would restart, i want to buy Vynial

<Deacon> oh yea, store I work at sell mlp coloring books. I wanted to look at them, but they're in the front of the store
<MisterBull82> that's what I do
<Vivix> noone listens during the stream anyway, it's just a crazy explosion of joy
<Kammerjunk> It was ludicrous at the Derpy episode, it'll be absolutely bonkers during the first S3 streaming.
<Dark92Enigma> i'VE learned to watch and commentate at the same time
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, hopefully.
<Socks> Vivix: XD
<MisterBull82> though I cant help but watch the chat sometimes just to read the funny comments about the episode
<Zamer> i was afraid it would break the stream that day
<Dark92Enigma> EVEN i wrote some sentences to avoid missing the good scenes
<Invi> tomarro is double episode, right?
<Zamer> luckily i was also recording it on the hub
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: I'm not going anywhere :)
<Dark92Enigma> ON WORD
<jbh1145> THE CUTEST THING IVE SEEN IN MY LIFE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b4goHbf0lU&feature=g-high-rec
<Kammerjunk> I usually hide in regulars.
<Dark92Enigma> Invi: yes. A TWO-PARTER
<Socks> I fully expect the stream to break as the majority of europe shall be here.
<Deacon> jbh1145 also the most funniest :D
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, at least some don't.
<MisterBull82> @socks: bloody brits! ruining our pony tiem!
<pony_6253> I'm watching from England!
<Zamer> What if the first episode secretly fixes everything, and episode 2 was a flashback
<Socks> :P
<DashWithRainbows> I'm glad I do that, MisterBull82.
<DashWithRainbows> :>
<Zamer> or episode 1
<Jmo> Chav.
<Zamer> of*

<Kammerjunk> MisterBull82: Don't tell that to a Brit, though. They don't like being associated with Europe.
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: Did you see the picture I posted a while back? :)
<Socks> What can I say, us brits love our poniz!

<alexxm> AJIsAwesome alough that was barely as i started watching in august
<AJIsAwesome> I became a brony around the time MMMystery on The Friendship Express. :)
<MisterBull82> I became a brony right in the middle of season 1
<Kammerjunk> I guess I started watching the show somewhere around the end of S1. I don't know, I didn't get into the fandom before well into the wait between series.
<Dark92Enigma> i'll try to sleep earlier after BMN is over
<Cypresswolf> Hello AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> HI Cypresswolf. :)
<pony_6253> I became a brony right at the end of season 1
<Zamer> same here 6253
<Ninjazz> I was a hater after S1's finale.
<Zamer> gotta love your first episode being the finale
<MisterBull82> obligatory hourly art spam: http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/135234062987.png seeking opinions to help further the piece :P
<AJIsAwesome> I considered becoming one after watching A Dog and Pony Show, but I didn't accept the label until Friendship Express aired.
<Zamer> spoils you throughout the ticket master episode
<Dark92Enigma> i remember i watched MLP FIM with the S2 premiere, a classmate from high school, told me to watch it......i LOVED how they used the Star Wars finale
<jbh1145> have no clue what this video is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZkZb589HrI
<Kammerjunk> I suppose I was never really a hater. It was so much easier to just scroll past content when I saw it.
<Deacon> I sorta came around the time cutie pox was shown
<Kammerjunk> That's what I get for being lazy.
<pony_6253> The first episode I saw was Mare in the moon
<Dark92Enigma> BUT i became a brony after watching ''Lesson ZERO'' and ''May the best pet win''
<jbh1145> TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO)

<pony_6253> I knew I was a brony after "Winter Wrap Up"
<DaringDerpy> 75000 seconds

<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, well, it's just that it tends to swing chat's topic into a rather unpleasant tone. :/
<Ninjazz> For most at least.
<Dark92Enigma> jbh1145: don't you mean vice-versa?
<alexxm> hey Dark92Enigma have you seen this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6cxNR02VLI

<Dark92Enigma> jbh1145: oh, you're talking about Over Two Rainbows

<jbh1145> they both suck
<jbh1145> PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY
<MisterBull82> are we talking about the wretched gen 3.5 infant versions of MLP?
<Kammerjunk> And then I realised Sweetie Belle is an orphan whose only biological parent is a double rainbow.
<AJIsAwesome> I think it was 3.6, right?
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: yes......
<AJIsAwesome> 3.5 was the chibi kid ponies?
<Kammerjunk> Not officially, but yes.
<MisterBull82> 3.56

<pony_8826> I am very proud about the fact that I've managed to avoid stuff like the Smile Smile Smile song for myself. And let me tell you, hearing it for the first time in the actual episode, without any prior knowledge is an AMAZING feel.
<MisterBull82> @wrek that's the first I've heard of this rule the whole time I've been in here o.0
<jbh1145> best vid ever: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoLCOc3lo6E&feature=watch-vrec

<Invi> MisterBull82 (protipp: look at the heading above the chat)
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoLCOc3lo6E&feature=watch-vrec
<Ninjazz> The only thing I want to hear in S3 is Shining Armor go TWILY again. Just one more time.

<MisterBull82> thanks
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: :D
<jbh1145> sporilers: he does

<MisterBull82> EqD is a terrible place not to get spoileered at
<Ninjazz> Curse you Kammer.

<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<jbh1145> CHOCOLATE!!!!!!!!!
<jbh1145> CHOCOLATE!!!!!
<Kammerjunk> MisterBull82: I don't even visit EQD in the time leading up to a new series.

<eyeplante> does anybody know of Silent Ponyville?
<Stillsick_icybeauti> He did???
<Ninjazz> Yup.
<AJIsAwesome> No spoilers of any kind. :)
<killerpony7733> Wrek Worst yet once the episode part 1 and 2 airs the manechat while chaotic people will probably post a metric ton of spoilers
<AJIsAwesome> killerpony7733: There's always +m
<Wrek> 05i "obviously" cant possible destinguish a joke spoiler from a real spoiler, so better kick for both <3
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome Surely no doubt. But again with alot more people and all and the manechat exploding i think theres gonna be a good deal that says ''oh i have seen that and i know what this is about hurr durr''
<MisterBull82> killerpony: also a bad habbit over on Ponychan... they try to keep the spoilers from cropping up, but every now and then someone would let it slip past the censory system
<AJIsAwesome> killerpony7733: Ah.
<Wrek> 05mane chat will be muted durign episode airing
<killerpony7733> Thank god
<Wrek> 05so chat will be in side rooms

<Wrek> 05easier to ban
<MadSurge> Everyone will go in their favorite pony chat :3
<Caznowl|Squedx> okie dokie
<Ninjazz> Well, atleast everyone's not discussing spoilers and being a downer about it at the same time like /mlp/.
<Kammerjunk> Nope, I'm in all of them.
<AJIsAwesome> Does Trollestia record all the side room chats?
<Ninjazz> #Rarity, gentelmen, I hope to see you there.
<MisterBull82> I prefer to go to the theater labelled under the pony I think the episode is centered on
<Kammerjunk> Please. Everybody knows #Twilight_Sparkle have the best conversations.
<MisterBull82> if I think its a Pinkie episode I go to the Pinkie Pie theater
<Uncle> Is there a video going on right now? I dont see anything
<AJIsAwesome> I switch between theaters every now and then.
<NullRadix> #Twilight_Sparkle is prepared for the zombie apocalypse
<Ninjazz> #Twilight_Sparkle is a downgrade #Rainbow_Dash.
<AJIsAwesome> I usually don't stick to one channel.
<Kammerjunk> I remember a discussion in the Twilight room about an object of infinite size existing inside another object of infinite size.
<YoureAlwaysADayAway> *Schultz Voice* "I see nothing!"
<Stillsick_icybeauti> I'll be on the rarity channel tomorrow...
<Kammerjunk> That was a while ago, though.
<AJIsAwesome> i'm not sure what channel I'm going to. :D
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: The Round Stable is much quicker to spot slip ups on the spoilers, and all first posts must be mod approved :$
<Uncle> Infinite isn't a real thing. It's an abstraction.
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: All of them! :3
<killerpony7733> Meh i'll probably just sit in quiet mane and some other non BS related channel probably
<Uncle> You can't have an object of infinite size
<Invi> Ninjazz, but Twily is awesome
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, that sounds incredibly facist.
<Ninjazz> Invi, TWILY.
<Kammerjunk> Uncle: Oh, of course, but it was fun all the same. That is, when only few people are there, of course.
<AJIsAwesome> Aw, come on TWILY.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: not at all
<Invi> ja, i always say twily ^^
<Ninjazz> OH I missed you, kid.
<Invi> :D
<MisterBull82> I kinda miss when Bronystate used livestream.. to me, their chat system is the least laggy (at least on the main livestream page it is) I've had problems with the stream and the chat sucking up my system memory on this laptop for some horrible reason
<VenHur> Hello to all again.
<jbh1145> im watching the mlp fim live show thing, its scary
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, VenHur. :)
<Kammerjunk> jbh1145: Look at their hind legs. LOOK AT THEM.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, the point where it has to be "mod approved" kinda scares me though.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: that means there's a spoilers thread and noone is allowed to post those in anyother thread
<jbh1145> I KNOW
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, only spoiler's thread?
<Deacon> MisterBull82 the livestream's only for episode days, but looks like it's gonna be used tomorrow
<MisterBull82> @deacon: ah, cool
<BladedWings|HW> hi VenHur
<jbh1145> where is pinkie, rarity, and fluttershy?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: the first posts of every new user. After that they're not
<VenHur> So, is there is not a single live stream recording as of now?
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, that's... an odd way of moderation but okay.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: it's just so that no troll waltzes in and posts shit/spoilers/whatever
<Invi> so many ponies here :D
<MisterBull82> VenHur: whats your timezone, bro?
<Deacon> Invi mmhmm
*NullRadix starts sandbagging his corner
<VenHur> It's the Mexican time zone.
<jbh1145> applejack dosent sound southern she sounds european
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: And yes, there's a spoiler thread. Just avoid that and you'll know nothing about the new episodes :D
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02so many ponehs o3o

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:3

<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Caznowl|Squedx> meep
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: MLP/Littlest Petshop Combo Promo

<Ninjazz> They're REALLY pushing that show on the fandom.
<MisterBull82> good ol' Luigi's Mansion.. loved the atmosphere, but the game gradually got boring.. and I could never for some reason beat the last bos
<AJIsAwesome> The SFX matched so well with the gameplay. :D

<MisterBull82> Ninjazz: good question
<DashWithRainbows> Well there's your problem, BlazeAngel
<DashWithRainbows> You're using a wireless
<BlazeAngel> :/
<Kammerjunk> Hey, wireless is the future.
<DashWithRainbows> Not for mouses.
<MilkyWhiskers> BlazeAngel: Just got some chips and soda, and i am ready for this f-f-frrrida-ay night
<DashWithRainbows> Or keyboards
<Kammerjunk> Even wireless powering of your devices.
<Kammerjunk> No, really.
<Dark_Horst> have you ever noticed how the big stone wall in minas tirith looks like a giant nose snorting a coke line?
<Zombert> Hey everypony hows it going

<BlazeAngel> MilkyWhiskers, settle in. 5 hours. Trololol...
<DashWithRainbows> I'll always stick with wired.
<Snow> BlazeAngel: check the batteries, or check if the reciever in the pc is connected
<Deacon> lali-ho Zombert
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: wat
<Ninjazz> I'm just saying that I'd like to keep this room as entertaining as possible.
<MilkyWhiskers> BlazeAngel: Yeah, XD
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: come on, it's obvious
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Zombert. :)
<Invi> DashWithRainbows, you know, it is possible to transfer electricity wireless (but that technic needs to improve)
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: OH MY GOD IT DOES.
<Zombert> It has been a long week I cant tell you that much
<Ninjazz> Dark_Horst, yes.
<Zamer> or get some Zombie Powered Turbines going
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Consarnit, cannot unsee.
<Dark_Horst> now we probably know why all the "stone" in there is white
<Dark_Horst> the whole city is a giant stash!
<Zombert> 0_0 what did I walk into
<Ninjazz> Helm's Deep got's nothing on Minas Tirath.
<Invi> ponies
<Kammerjunk> Zombert: BronyState 5 hours before we have any reason to be here.

<Kammerjunk> Is it just me, or are all lawyer commercials funny?
<Snow> its you.
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, hilarious.
<Kammerjunk> They're probably the only funny part of a lawyer, so at least they have that.
<MisterBull82> Ninjazz: up til the arrival of the one true king, Minis Tirrith was just a shallow shell of itself... the Steward of Gondor was a weak fragile old man, corrupted by the seeing stone that he possessed, and he saw no hope... so as he weakened, so did the moral of the armies that protected that city... it was the Horsemen who came and saved them in the end, was it not?
<Snow> dat wall of text
<MisterBull82> lol
<Ninjazz> MisterBull82, no, dude. In all seriousness, it was ALL Gandalf.

<VenHur> Oh, so then Yugo is new, isn't he?
<AJIsAwesome> Think so. :)
<Deacon> Yugo watch with us!

*BlazeAngel fills Bronystate with a non-lethal gas wich gives a pony Double Rainbow sydrome.

<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: Isn't it obvious?
<BlazeAngel> Invi, yeah, all the buggers you and I know are gone.
<Alicone> whats going on in here
<Yugo> I'm not a new pony, I just never bothered with the streams before because of how full they are and how they seem to break down, for me at least
<Solidness> spraying r34 in TF2 is great
<Invi> BlazeAngel, not really...
<Yugo> I hope they work this time around...
<AJIsAwesome> .....
<Snow> ITS NOT
<donutpop365> Do you think we'll crash the streaming service tomorrow?
<AJIsAwesome> donutpop365: I hope not. :D
<Yugo> Am I supposed to be seeing something on the left right now?
*Jmo hugs Snow
<Jmo> There there.
<Invi> BlazeAngel, most of them are still here
<Snow> people like me never foget it!
<BlazeAngel> Invi, are they still lurking in DashieSauce?
<Alicone> uh no Yugo
<Jmo> It'll all be fine.
<Snow> forget*
<donutpop365> AJIsAwesome: Ohhai *noms*. Me too...
<Solidness> just spinning
<Deacon> donutpop365 doubt it, but the chat network might
<Alicone> wait 4 hours, they are streaming how to train your dragon and the jetsones movie.
<Invi> BlazeAngel, uh, that too
*AJIsAwesome is nommed :D
<Yugo> Phew, good. Yeah just spinny.
<donutpop365> Deacon: Makes sense.
<Alicone> and then a 10 episode pony marathon
<Yugo> Bookmarking bronystate, just in case, then.
<donutpop365> MadSurge: Heyo.
<jbh1145> discord returning?
<HaberDash> Guys how full is this chat gonna be when Season 3 hits
<Alicone> Its gonna be filled.
<Deacon> HaberDash very full
<donutpop365> Understatement of the century?
<MadSurge> :D hi donutpop365!
<Yugo> I think I might just leave the computer on all day tomorrow, to reserve my spot. @_@
<Solidness> couple a hundred I guess
<Alicone> You guys ever watch twitch tv? The amount of spam when a speedrunner gets a world record doesn't even compare.
<Yugo> Seeing how full it is already
<MadSurge> There's already 50 more people than usual :D
<HaberDash> I can just picture the game of thrones meme in my head
<Yugo> Brace yourselves...
<Solidness> Remember the derpy chat stream
*Deacon doesn't brace himself
<Solidness> It'll be like that
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: i know, right? :D
<Alicone> So, every Friday we get two movies?
<Alicone> why don't I come here more.
<Snow> ive seen it
<Deacon> yup
<Yugo> Question: What's the difference between theatres?
<Snow> it was like a TSUNAMI!!!
<AJIsAwesome> Yugo: Mane chat will be closed, so side rooms will be open. :)
<Alicone> There isn't.
<Deacon> and two user picked episodes
<Alicone> They are just different things.
<Solidness> different audiences
<Alicone> Wait, I just left and went to Rarity... but- wh
<AJIsAwesome> Yugo: Nothing. Just controls chat traffic. :)
<Alicone> I saw all you guys in Rainbow Dash.
<Yugo> So it's just to split the chat load then, ahkay.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: It will be GWEAT :D
<AJIsAwesome> It shall be GLORIOUS~
<Snow> untill s3
<Solidness> Otherwise a post will be off the screen
<Snow> theater doesnt matter
<Solidness> in 1 second flat
<Yugo> What do you mean by side rooms, AJIsAwesome?
<Deacon> the pony rooms
<donutpop365> MadSurge: Which one you gonna be in tomorrow?
<AJIsAwesome> Yugo: Like channels such as Applejack, Pinkie Pie, etc.
<HaberDash> tommorrow I'll be singing "finally the moment has arrived"
<Alicone> so it goes like this
<Yugo> Oh, so we're actually in a "mane server" right now?
<Ninjazz> Hey, just a quick PSA. Read the rules and FAQ if you're new. Save yourself some trouble.
<Solidness> FOR ME TO BE ONE LUCKY GUY
<Terrafox> Is there anything running on the stream right now or is mine broken?
<Deacon> please join the rarity room, it's so quiet :(
<Solidness> nothing's playing atm
<Alicone> how to train your dragon>pony episode>jetsons movie>pony episode>10 episode pony marathon?
<MadSurge> donutpop365: isn't it obvious? Pinkie Pie :D
<Terrafox> ty Solidness
<AJIsAwesome> Make sure to read the Rules and FAQ like Ninjazz said. It makes things much easier! :)
<Ninjazz> Wait wut.

<alicone8721> That horrible feeling when a book version of a fanfic you love came out and only 150 copies were made.

<BlazeAngel> Yugo. Y U SO HEAD BANGY?
<Solidness> Is there a fan-fic describing Luna's fall to Nightmare Moon?
<Yugo> Because I tend to ask questions too hastily and people are likely to start hating me for asking too many questions. :<
<BlazeAngel> Deacon, it's a possible ban.
<NullRadix> Solidness: plenty.
<Deacon> wouldn't say that, it'sa just annoying
<AJ> there is no hate here
<Solidness> Name some?
<donutpop365> Shizuschlafen: What's with the name change? Or is that the original name?
<Solidness> No hate
<BlazeAngel> Deacon, It is. Read dem rules son.
<Solidness> only tolerance
<Deacon> donutpop365 that's her sleep mode name

<NullRadix> just be careful of "tab-fails"
<Snow> NullRadix: thanks for the toip, didnt know the tab thingie
<Solidness> how long has it been since the last wedding episode?
<Deacon> ekips Snow well our manager's not getting that many hours, but luckly I';m getting hours at another store
<Snow> been typing all names
<Yugo> NullRadix: Whoa, magic. Just like how Xcode autocompletes the codes.
<NullRadix> Yugo: Snow: just remember to make sure tab actually put the name you wanted
<Gekoncze> hey
<Kimori> hi
*Panda- slaps Yahooz around a bit with a large trout

*Yahooz slaps Panda- around a bit with a large trout
<Panda-> ^^
<NullRadix> well you can always just type... I tend to type the shorter names
<Yahooz> i have that command too
<alicone8721> It'd be cool if you clicked the character on the header it would take you to the theater named after them.
<NullRadix> but yeah you can tab complete multiple names in the same line
<Panda-> Yahooz, I know.

<FlaschenJoe11> Would it be a spoiler if I say it will be awesome?
<RaveBrony> Kammerjunk: Yeah, haha. Ive got to work hardcore to improve my art... :(
<Wrek> 05basically
<pony_8826> But that's against the RUUUUURUS
<Zamer> CriticKitten that was because someone told them a spoiler

<AJIsAwesome> Discussion of anything S3 is forbidden.
<J_E_Smith71> Hey AJIsAwesome which side room do you use for new eps? I usually use Pinkie. Problem is us regulars may be split up during the ep if we go in different rooms
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: I gave up and started focusing completely on improving my Java.

<BlazingStreak> All my friends who watch it say Matt Smith is the worst
<FriendshipIsRarity> inb4 battle to be won.
<SnipsandSnails> Hi
<Professor> How to train your dragon was a good story its just that the voice actor is sooooo anoying.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> MattSmith is a good Docto
<emiliomick> how to train your dragons a pretty good movie
<Michael> hai SnipsandSnails
<Zamer> the only reason why most people go for Tennant is because he had more time to develop his role unlike most doctors especially Ecclesion
<SuperTristan03> 6_9
<pony_6110> Thanks, I was not too sure.
<pony_4942> My favorite episode has to be Green Isn't Your Color
<seapony_8826> Baking these treats is such a bitch add a teaspoon of Godzilla

<AlienWarhead> pony_4942: link?
<SuperTristan03> cross my heart hope to fly stick a cupcake in my eye
<Zamer> well the reason for that was because they weren't sure how it was going to be for the relaunch so they originally planned to do a new actor per season
