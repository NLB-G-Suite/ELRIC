<donutpop365> For SirGanjalf.
<Sabershy> Phase4: I see. Well,either way, Bose is usually universaly accpeted to produce the best speakers/headphones so if you are going for somthing, go for them.
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=321005657007
<Jmo> Maan for $500 I'd rather buy a sound system, you trippin' bra.
<Kimori> Not sure what to say about that
<AJIsAwesome> donutpop365: You could PM him it. :)
<SirGanjalf> donutpop365: just pm me

<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: what is?
<Panda> eddmario cheew out and eat out mean two different things... one you would do to your girl friend the other you would do to a college that fails to pull his weight in a group project.
<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: i wasnt the one who thought of it, many people use it :P
<Kencolt> Telling Pando to go to bread. It's kind of complicated.
<donutpop365> "/)
<Panda> Kencolt knows me???
<donutpop365> Rawr, keeps on trying to recognize as a command.
<eddmario> Panda: Yeah, eat out is the college roommate one, and chew out is the chick thing. Or are they the other way around?
<Kencolt> Panda: No, but I do know some Japanese and Japanses culture and brand names.

<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: no wai :O
<Moopy> yay how its made show
<eddmario> Wait, do they STILL make episodes of this?
<Sumica> 00,10and the sun's a mass of incandasent gas
<twilight_sprinkle> inb4 puns
<XylemTube> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<XylemTube> best stream ever
<eddmario> Aren't ice skates just modified shoes?
<eddmario> Um, I'm pretty sure most people call them Jetskis...
<Sumica> 00,10waverunners
<taoumi> sea du is a brand name. >.>
<donutpop365> Ugh... Soooooo.... Sleeeeeepyyy...
<Sumica> 00,10so is jello
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The sun's mass is less than or equal to the mass of the original Xbox
<taoumi> yes but how it's made is usaly very brand generic
<taoumi> liek their 'jello' episode they alwase said gellitain
<donutpop365> Alrighty everypony, I'm gonna hit the hay, it's 2:30 In the mornin' here, g'night everypony!
*donutpop365 Snore
<twilight_sprinkle> night donutpop365
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Night donutpop365 :)
<Sumica> 00,10they probably had to say sea doo
<taoumi> night donutpop365
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm going to bed too :3
<Sumica> 00,10inorder to get to toor the factory
<Kencolt> A Jetski and a Seadoo are two different brands. The Jetski is, IIRC, built somewhat differently-- and ridden more skilike, where the Seadoo is less so. But I may well be mistaken.
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Night all :)
<taoumi> meh it's understandable
*donutpop365 High fives NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<donutpop365> night twilight_sprinkle, NewSuperBronyU, taoumi.
<twilight_sprinkle> nightu NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<Sumica> 00,10there are not many companys that make jetski's and such
<taoumi> night NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<donutpop365> Ciao, and goodnight. :)
<Baka-Neku> NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: sleep weel my love =D
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: wait
<taoumi> that's true Sumica
<taoumi> and it's not a genaric item like aluminium or corn flakes
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<Sumica> 00,10that's rather hitech
<taoumi> lets not ever watch the 'jello' episode
<Kencolt> I just checked. Letski's usually don't have much in the way of a seat-- you're standing on them. A Seadoo has more of a seatlike configuration-- the Motorcycle analogy.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but see doo is a brand
<Sumica> 00,10wave runner is the type of craft
<Sumica> 00,10would not think IR could make out text
<taoumi> why not. it's jsut a flashlight
<twilight_sprinkle> if its black on white it probably isnt hard
<twilight_sprinkle> taoumi: lol no
<Sumica> 00,10and now you see why wine cost so damn much
<taoumi> twilight_sprinkle: actualy it usualy is. jsut o na fequency that is not visable
<twilight_sprinkle> taoumi: thats a lot more complex than a flash light though
<twilight_sprinkle> taoumi: if it were just a flashlight, it could easily show colors
<taoumi> most night vision is heavily dependent on a light source and a reciver. twilight_sprinkle . and i use flash light i nthe most vauge of terms. nto spesificaly a tube that emits the visable light spectrum
<twilight_sprinkle> taoumi: i know that, im saying that making it make text visible isnt easy
<taoumi> why wouldn't it be?
<twilight_sprinkle> taoumi: well im not entirely sure of the specifics of the programming of the night vision, but it cant even show color
<Kencolt> And most corks these days are plastic. Oh, that was so darn simplified it was almost painful.
<taoumi> color has nothign to do with reflecting the brightness of soemthing twilight_sprinkle
<The_Engineer> hey everybody I'm back :)
<The_Engineer> Internet went down
<ShyBetaFemale> morning!
<The_Engineer> Money Success Fame Bronies
<twilight_sprinkle> taoumi: brightness isnt whats being reflected, its specific waelengths
<Sumica> 00,10hi ShyBetaFemale and The_Engineer
<twilight_sprinkle> wb The_Engineer and ShyBetaFemale
<taoumi> i liek synthetiv corks Kencolt they work alot better then natual corks
<Kencolt> So, Shy, when's the release date? I mean, your being still in Beta and all...
<twilight_sprinkle> masterboards
<ShyBetaFemale> not allowed to say Kencolt :P
<taoumi> what are you talking about twilight_sprinkle. color has to do w/ wave lenght. brightness is volume of photons
<Phase4> yay~
<taoumi> you know what. i'm doen wit hthis i wash my hands
<Phase4> how its made
<Phase4> dat edging machine
<Sumica> 00,10take wood, grind it up to make wood...........
*taoumi washes hands
<Phase4> Sumica, ikr
<Kencolt> taoumi: I have found certain differences between the flavors of the various types of corks. Also, natural cork actually tends to give a better seal, due to it's swelling, but it's expensive these days, so you usually only find it on the higher end products.
<twilight_sprinkle> taoumi: yes, and its based not on the volume that is being received, but the wavelengths that have been received back, like a radar afaik
<Phase4> Sumica, though partical board and mdf are often made of scrap so its generally ok
<Sumica> 00,10true
<Sumica> 00,10oh god it's ikea wood
<Kencolt> Sumica: More take scraps and grind it up to make something that you can bld with. I'm okay with that, it's "green".
<Phase4> mdf is a fun material, wod powder + glue
<Phase4> wood'
<JRP2234> mica wtf did i draw
<taoumi> aaa Kencolt but natual cork has a tendncy to rot if left alone too long. synthetic dosen't have that problem... but it is true it dosen't seal so well i nthe sort term
<taoumi> and it can make a funky tast if it gets sugar in it :/
<Kencolt> taoumi: Not in wine-- there are bottles hundreds of years old that are still intact. The cork reacts to the wine. Storage also plays a lot into it.
<Phase4> << aparently its insanely dificult to do this work with machines
<taoumi> not alwase true Kencolt. whiel some are stil lgood... others are jsut vinigar :/. nto sure if it's a mater of the cork or the bottleing.
<Kencolt> Trust me- my father was a wine maniac. When I was a kid, his idea of lunch was fruit and cheese and a nice wine. And I was a 16 year old who sometimes joined him... with, admittedly, a much cmaller glass. Dad Didn't France, but he highly approved of their eating habits.
<Phase4> wine? glass bottle sealed with epoxy, that should hold it
<Kencolt> And it's more the bottling.
<taoumi> lol your dad didn't france
<Kencolt> UNtil comparative recently (historically speaking) glass bottles were uneven and non-standardised, so bottles could be... wonky. Seals were uncertain if the glassblower was less than skilled.
<twilight_sprinkle> the french drink soooo much..
<ShyBetaFemale> guys
<ShyBetaFemale> what are you doing for halloween
<Kencolt> Oddly enough, modern consistent glass bottles were invented to carry BEER in America... but the winemakers knew when they saw a good thing.
<twilight_sprinkle> when i was in France, we were staying at family friends, so the house owners wife got so drunk, she woke me up in the middle of the night with a shotgun to go shoot invisible people
<taoumi> so do the itilians
<taoumi> but the wine is reaaaaaaaly weak
<Kencolt> taoumi: Well, not all wines-- but it's true that beaujolais isn't that much stronger than soda.
<naturesfury> suddenly pony
<twilight_sprinkle> well this is interestin
<taoumi> if i can press myself to make my boobs tonight all i will have left ot do is my homework tomarow

<Rommulus> Hello all
<Sumica> 00,10hi Rommulus
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> by Nintendo person you mean Nintendo fanboy, right sumica?
<Rommulus> :)
<Kencolt> And I doubt even HE has a C-64. (I had a c-128 when I waqs a kid, but that was so long ago... my first real computer system. Comp, diskdrive, monitor, even a printer... I was the tech geek of the block. I even had a modem. (Although noting existed but dial-up local message boards back then.)
<Alchemist> yep, Ingram and Anderson are still great.
<Sumica> 00,10he's speaking of emulaters Kencolt
<XylemTube> poor tutles :'(
<Kencolt> Sumica: Ah. I'm not. ^_^
<Sumica> 00,10but you would be right, my first computer was a 386
<Sumica> 00,10still useing the same case
<Sumica> 00,10and yes Alchemist, tis why I love the voice off eps
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> 386 and 486
<Sumica> 00,10even when it's not big musical eps like this the bgm is still great
<Kencolt> It certainly shows how much of the fullmusical number is carried by the singing as well.
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<therainbowvortex> hey Sumica wher did u get yr name from
<Sumica> 00,10Armored core
<therainbowvortex> cool
<therainbowvortex> whats armored core
<Sumica> 00,10A play station game
<therainbowvortex> oh awsome
<Alchemist> Ohh, I saw a LP about it on YT, seemed like an interesting game.
<Sumica> 00,10if i ever got a PS3 it would be for that game
<Sumica> 00,10Rarity loved that part I am sure
<dishwasher1910> you really dont need to do all of this just for a pet
<thegt90> just found this http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8184/
<therainbowvortex> hey Sumica i have an antie who is british and talks like rarity
<Alchemist> Make others compete for love. Totally morally acceptable :D
<Sumica> 00,10lol
<Sumica> 00,10nice they they made there own score for this rather then just copy pasta
<XylemTube> I forget, whats the name of this song?
<Sumica> 00,10flight of the valcurys
<Sumica> 00,10only spelled the right way
<XylemTube> ah yes thanks
<Alchemist> Wouldnt they have to own the rights if they copypasted it?
<dishwasher1910> awwww shieettt viking helmets with battle axe and all that good stuff
<XylemTube> Hey you guys mind if i post a couple of links? They arent youtube.
<Sumica> 00,10I think it's an old enough song that it's free and clear
<Sumica> 00,10abbalanch
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> lots of songs are pretty much public domain at this point
<MadSurge> Publical domain, yeah
<Sumica> 00,10kinda like the whilham scream
<Kencolt> I just checekd out EQD's nightly round up. I learned something very important. Turkey should NOT be allowed to adapt MLP:FiM under ANY circumstances. BUt they already did...
<Sumica> 00,10tank has a theme, go figure
<Alchemist> But beware, if you get 10-20 mp3 illegally and get caught you will be fines for millions of dollars.
<Sumica> 00,10oh more bad dubing to stream Kencolt?
<Sumica> 00,10Twi has 3 pets
<Kencolt> Sumica: Not merely that. Turkey apparenly has some amazing cencorship laws. How else do you explain five episodes being BANNED?
<Sumica> 00,10lolwut?
<Rommulus> Where did she get those bandages?
<Sumica> 00,10tank had them clearly
<Kencolt> Tank carried the bandages in his trunk.
<Rommulus> Oh tank, so caring
<Sumica> 00,10so why cant dash have 2 if twi has 3
<Alchemist> You have won, but Im gonna award the guy arriving last anyways. morally totally acceptable again :D
<therainbowvortex> Sumica: twi has 3 how so
<Kencolt> Sumica: Twilight has one pet. Spike has a pet phoenix. Spike is not a pet, he's a little brother and assistant.
<Sumica> 00,10owl, spike and pipsqueeke
<Kencolt> Sumica: Pipsqueak is a PONY from Trottingham. You mean PeeWee.
<therainbowvortex> Sumica: im going to go and agree with Kencolt here sorry
<Sumica> 00,10right
<Shizuka> 13>4:38
<Shizuka> 13MIIIINECRAAAAAFT
<Dat_Octavia> Wow, more people around at this hour here than a year ago. lol
<Shizuka> 13i knew this would happen but i wouldn't listen...
<Sumica> 00,10just use settime reallife Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13i blame phase for showing off tekkit >>
<Sumica> 00,10hehe
<Dat_Octavia> Ah, so thats who has my color now!
<Dat_Octavia> Prepare for battle heaten!
<Rommulus> steampunk tank <3
<Dat_Octavia> *heathen
<Sumica> 00,10you could say that tavi
<Shizuka> 13sending a tunnel boring train into the earth and having it come back with stacks and stacks of ore is too satisfying
<Sumica> 00,10I will have to try that
<Kencolt> Go ahead, Sumica -- find and show them how damn GOOD we have it.
<Dat_Octavia> Pfft. Havent even been here in who knows how many months and I dont even get a "hey". lol
<MadSurge> Japan Pinkie :4
<Alchemist> japanese?
<MadSurge> :3
<Jmo> Hayo Dat_Octavia.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> why doesnt the bronystate staff just have a 24/7 minecraft server?
<Kencolt> Although, were this person to do a full JP dub... it would work.
<Rommulus> Hi Dat_Octavia
<MadSurge> Hello Dat_Octavia :D
<Shizuka> 13DeadpoolDash|GW2: cause minecraft is a hog, and none of us have the inclination to pay for a server
<Sumica> 00,10so you meen this Kencolt?
<Alchemist> and arabic?
<Shizuka> 13if/when we host we do it off our own boxen, which is a drain on resources
<MadSurge> Hello Shizuka :$
<Dat_Octavia> Most of the people here dont know me. It was a time... long long ago, when Bronystate was still young... *flashback!*
<Alchemist> or turkish?
<Kencolt> Oddly, there is no official MLP dub in Japan-- they have only fansubs. But Gravity Falls IS being officially dubbed.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> does it eat bandwidth?
<Shizuka> 13depending on how many people are on
<Sumica> 00,10memory more then bandwith
<thegt90> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7670/
<Shizuka> 13get over 3 people and the memory requirement shoots up
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> need a seperate server box then
<Shizuka> 13plus CPU for keeping up with chunk updates
<Sumica> 00,10did they skip a bit/
<Kencolt> Sumica: No. Check out EQD and the Nightly Roundup-- it's in there. And prepare to be horrified. I mean amazed. Yeah,. that's the ticket.
<Dat_Octavia> Ever since I started using that site to link to pics on EqD, ppl have been using it a lot more...
<Alchemist> thegt90: the singing isnt bad imo
<Shizuka> 13anyway.. crash time..
<MadSurge> Dat_Octavia: Well, welcome back! Hope you still enjoy yourself :)
<thegt90> no i caint understand it even thoug i know the song
<Sumica> 00,10go to bread Shizuschlafen

<Dat_Octavia> I think the people at mylittlefacewhen should be tanking me. Ever since I started linking to their site a lot on EqD, I see it a lot more now. lawl
<Rommulus> :)
<Kencolt> Translating from any one language to another-- and culture follows--- is always a hit of miss process. Some miss more than others.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona! *hugs*
<Sumica> 00,10morning Gold_Demona

<Starchaser> that sounded evil
<Gold_Demona> My favorite is Wonderscrews
<Kencolt> But in the Danish version-- FRENCH DISCORD?
<Alchemist> I think the french and german dubs are really great based on what I saw.
<MadSurge> Still have to hear Italian Chrysalis and Discord
<Gold_Demona> I see where they made the translation error, and it's really funny. XD
<MadSurge> But Discord is BATMAN
<Rommulus> I want to hear Italian ponies as well
<MadSurge> Wow, pretty good!

<SirGanjalf> Rommulus: This one's better?
<Gold_Demona> lol Princess? Not Principessa?
<Rommulus> Not better sadly
<Rommulus> french is so much softer
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: IKR
<Tovler> No Klingon version?
<Gold_Demona> I demand a Klingon dub of this series
<MadSurge> Hnnngggghhhh~
<Gold_Demona> A Klingon dub would be GLORIOUS!!!
<Rommulus> Some pony must make a Klingon dub
<DerpyMuffins> I want a Brititsh dub
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: Her name is licensed as Princess Celestia. And Princess Luna. And as we have seen, atempts to "translate" names seem to suffer horribly...
<DerpyMuffins> You know everyone has British accents
<Sumica> 00,10it's funny how many difrent ways they have pinking make a fall sound
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I can't wait to see if they reuse the Nightmare Moon voice for Bigluna :D
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: So Princess is her NAME and not her TITLE?
<Tovler> No way in hell a Klingon version hasn't been done yet. To the youtubes
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: in the italian dub
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: It's her title-- IN EQUESTRIA.
<Sumica> 00,10she sound evil

<Gold_Demona> Hey MadSurge, do you guys still get new dubbed Lupin specials over there?
<DerpyMuffins> Her shadow could have been done better though
<Rommulus> Oppa Klingon Style http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CayMeza487M >.>
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: to be honest I never saw Lupin specials, and the series pops out occasionally
<MadSurge> So no I guess
<Gold_Demona> Last I checked the most recent Italian dubbed Lupin special was Green vs Red. Figured I'd ask. :P
<DerpyMuffins> Luna's eyes are a few shades too light of a cyan
<MadSurge> I saw a DVD of that while browsing stuff on a mall :D
<Gold_Demona> I like to collect the italian dubbed Lupin cuz I like watching it when I can kind of quasi understand half of every other sentence. lol
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<MadSurge> Kinda how I started enjoying english and spanish comedy
<Gold_Demona> From what little I do know of Italian outside of what sounds like Spanish. :D
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY7AK4k3Idk
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: just fill in the gaps with what you know :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so, is your accent american or spanish? Or a mix?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: American, sadly. Never had any friends to speak Spanish with.
<Gold_Demona> All the Spanish I speak is with my family
<Jmo> Espanol~
<Gold_Demona> Yesh Español
<Jmo> Si senorita.
*AdamTheDuck slaps Jmo around a bit with some large trout
<Gold_Demona> Señora. I'm married. :P
<Jmo> PFFFFFFT
<Gold_Demona> Sañorita is "miss"
<Jmo> Don't you try playing me with your fancy language.
<Gold_Demona> Señorita*
<Gold_Demona> :D
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: kinda funny hearing people not being able to pronounce senorita right, huh? :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: IKR? :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Hearing them try to pronounce ANY Spanish words is pretty funny. :D
<MadSurge> Yesh, same for italian with any word with the GN sound :D
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> http://youtu.be/VurPtgu874g
<Gold_Demona> If I remember right, the GN in Italian is the same as the Ñ in Spanish.
<MadSurge> Correct!
<Gold_Demona> Like how "lasagna" is pronounced "lasaña"
<Gold_Demona> "lasanya"
<Socks> Hey all
<MadSurge> Yep
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Socks
<Gold_Demona> I love lasagna. :$
<Gold_Demona> Ohai Socks
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/obdLhRTfDFo
*Socks hugs Gold_Demona and AdamTheDuck
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: delicious and filling!
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> http://youtu.be/hjfJXi7S18Y
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe CrimsonPhoenix, that's my screen saver :P
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: My husband and I often jokingly pronounce it "la ZAG nuh"
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, as well as I
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Gold_Demona> I have a couple language programs of Italian lying around. I just haven't gotten around to playing with them. :D
<Gold_Demona> Been distracted. XD
<Gold_Demona> By ponies. And pokémon. And Star Wars. And Assassins.
<Socks> :D
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> http://youtu.be/bp6YZ4Go3Cc
<Jmo> >_>
<Jmo> Curse your distractions.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/3Ffu0h2vrzk
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: LOL, yeah Dema still has to kick those Plasmas' asses. XD
<Jmo> ;__;
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: still on the first Assassin's Creed?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yesh
<Jmo> Each day goes by I refresh my DA in hope of seeing a new comic.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: just wait until you see virtual Italy in AC2 :$
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I'll get through it eventually. Keep being distracted by other games. :D
<Jmo> The pain.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Is it anything like the real one?
*Jmo curls up and cries
*AdamTheDuck pats Jmo :<
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> http://youtu.be/zN46qd5aOqE
<Gold_Demona> Poor Jmo. :<
<Gold_Demona> Don't worry. I'll get back to it someday. I always do. :P
<Socks> AC2 is really good
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: not just anything like it, it's pretty much faithful to the ancient city plans!
<Socks> I managed to finish it in a day :P
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ooh, that's awesome. =D
<Ponies47> Good morning everypony :3
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning Ponies47
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dat lower pitched version http://youtu.be/GYTNY8qqFe4
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: you can totally recognize some of the roads if you've visited the cities in the game
<Gold_Demona> Socks: I'm currently playing through the series for the first time. Still on the first one. :D
<BoroBrony> good morning Ponies47 :)
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That will probably make me want to visit Italy even more than I already do. :D
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Ponies47
<Socks> Gold_Demona: The only one I've played is 2, still a really good game, currently doing a peaceful run of it.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: should resume playing it, but I can't stay on PS3 and PC at the same time. Parents :P
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I have all PC version. Steam sales are my bane. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: they don't really mind me playing the 3DS and PC at the same time though :D
<DerpyMuffins> You're a good artist Ponies47, do you take special commissons?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I have an old laptop, definitely can't run those games on this :|
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Jmo> DAMN YOU STEAM SALES.
<MadSurge> Ohai DerpyMuffins and Ponies47!
<Jmo> My wallet weeps with sorrow.
<Ponies47> Why thanks DerpyMuffins, I don't take them really at the moment
<AdamTheDuck> We know that feel Jmo... We know it oh too well...
<Jmo> But you don't know it like me ;__;
<MadSurge> Steam sales are good for me to get some games I'll play once I have a better computer :D
<Socks> DerpyMuffins: I'm not an artist but I can have a go :P
<Jmo> Luckily my list doesn't grow as much as it use to.
<Jmo> Ask Dema, she knows how many games I have.
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, .-.
<DerpyMuffins> Oh well, tell me when you do Ponies47
<Jmo> Hate you Gabe.
<Gold_Demona> I bought the whole Assassin's Creed series during Steam's summer sale because they had all four games in a bundle for 30 bucks. o_o
<MadSurge> Thank heavens for the Steam Cloud

<Gold_Demona> I don't like steam cloud. It screws up my Plants vs Zombies when I switch between playing on my PC and my Mac.
<Jmo> Oi
<Jmo> Steam Cloud is good :<

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I didn't plan on getting a Mac anyway, they're too costly
<Jmo> WELL
<Jmo> ID UNNO
<Gold_Demona> If not for that, I'd use it in a heartbeat
<Gold_Demona> Without thinking even
<Jmo> Can see the flaw in it >_>
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, turn off Steam cloud for PvZ then, that might do the trick
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I tell you what though. It's obvious Assassin's Creed was made as a console game. The PC controls are TERRIBLE. It made me glad I had an XBox controller lying around.
<AdamTheDuck> For some reason I have the sudden urge to rewatch Neon Gensis...
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: I did. ANd it did. :P

<NullRadix> Hoy!
<NullRadix> Good morning, Good afternoon, or Good evening!
<NullRadix> Take your pick, any or all
<Cypresswolf> I always get lazy doing paperwork for the office - should have just skipped it and left for the jobsite this morning - I don't want to get out of this chair :(
<RainbowPie> good night for me :D
<Cypresswolf> mostly because I have a motorized packer with my name on it waiting for me - We're putting in underground pvc and today we're covering a finished trench - packing the dirt solid so the ground wont sink with the foundation is laid
<Cypresswolf> a few more creepy pics should chase me away :)
<NullRadix> what size is it? like... push size, sit-on size, or vehicle sized?
<NullRadix> feels like something I should know and I've seen... just can't recall
<NullRadix> and apologies, I don't keep a creepy pic library
<Cypresswolf> I posted a good one earlier :) and NOPE! I wont repost that one for awhile
*NullRadix shrugs
<Cypresswolf> :O I know the perfect site for creepy stuff :)
<Lil_B> hello guys :)
<NullRadix> happy morning time!
<Cypresswolf> :( it doesnt exist anymore
<Cypresswolf> used to have a huge archive of ghost pictures people sent in over many years - were thousands of them but havent checked the site in a few years - forgot about it
<MadSurge> There's a Pinball of the Dead game! :D
<Cypresswolf> almost 2 hours late and I still cant find the will to get out of my chair - looks like Im working til 5:30 today :)
<NullRadix> eww... working late

<NullRadix> OUT WITH YOU
<Cypresswolf> Overtime! - but they're making us work saturdays too - I hope it rains tomorrow :|
<Cypresswolf> cant work in a mud pit :)

<DoctoDoctorWho> There are so many 1 liners in it its not even funny, but it still is cuz its funny. If that made any sense to you you win a derpy.
<killerpony7733> Idunno one liners are funny cause it's meant as a quick laugh?

<Gold_Demona> Not finite...
<Gold_Demona> That's not the right word...
<Socks> big?
<Gold_Demona> I was looking for a more specific descriptor than that, but I guess that works
<Socks> Infinite?
<Socks> :P
<Cades> gtg cya

<doctor_whooves127> querk want to be saved by link
*Socks starts downloading 8 gigapixel picture... "8 days left"

<Lil_B> I was watching one ow these Halloween Light Music Videos, and I saw one for Gangnam style
<NullRadix> I'm always here
<Lil_B> but the GAME Blocked it for Germany :/
*NullRadix leans in close to DoctoDoctorWho. Always!
<Lil_B> GEMA*
<DoctoDoctorWho> NullRadix: did u finish cooler abridged?
<NullRadix> Indeed! I found it quite enjoyable.
<NullRadix> I just then jumped back into my programming
<DoctoDoctorWho> U r a computer savvy person?
<NullRadix> I'm a programmer. As part of being a programmer, you often become at least partially computer savvy
<NullRadix> But no, I do not specifically study or know how to fix your computer
*NullRadix coughs
<DoctoDoctorWho> I see, then I have a technical question that does not include my computer
*NullRadix eyes DoctoDoctorWho suspiciously
<NullRadix> go on...?
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony :3
<NullRadix> g'morning Spell-of-Gaming
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm just sitting here, waiting for all of the Minecraft mods to update to 1.4.2
<DoctoDoctorWho> Do you know how to remove a voice from a video? In the sense that singers A B & C made a music video, I want to remove Singer A's voice. How would I do this?
<NullRadix> a) you are touching on a subject I have very, VERY limited knowledge of. I don't work with audio much ( but might in the foreseeable future)
<NullRadix> as far as an actual answer... it may or may not be possible depending on the music format (I think)
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's possible if Singers B and C are in the back.
*xmasmare|Almond join stupidsexytwilight
<xmasmare|Almond> FUCK
<Spell-of-Gaming> LOL
<xmasmare|Almond> i need to learn slashes
<NullRadix> I would imagine... in the BEST possible scenario for that... the data for each singer is stored separately
<prince-dari> xmasmare|Almond: You're not very good at joining channels
<NullRadix> more likely, it's all stored in one stream of data, and while you may be able to use audio programs to pull that person's voice out, it would effect the rest of the track
<Spell-of-Gaming> Also, we found one secret
<xmasmare|Almond> prince-dari: :I dont judge me i just made a mistake
<NullRadix> Personally, I'm going to assume xmasmare|Almond's blunder was in fact, NOT a blunder... and in fact... A TRAP!
<Spell-of-Gaming> We can view a person's joined channels with /whois, anyway.
<prince-dari> Well, that is the second time you've done it though. :P
<NullRadix> prince-dari: taking temporal proximitiy into account?
<MadSurge> Hello prince-dari :)
<prince-dari> Ohai
*xmasmare|Almond is now just going to quit bronystate as a whole
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is there a stream going on?
<MadSurge> Nope
<String_Shredder> why quit when we have the master of kicking right here?
<String_Shredder> excuse me, banning.
<xmasmare|Almond> :I
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im attempting to edit a youtube vid for a local talent show, I remove the lead singers voice and sing in his place.
<Lil_B> just saw the new Trailer for the New Paper Mario Game... I was confusaed during the Goat Part... I still am
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm glad they're going back for the Turn-based RPG
<Spell-of-Gaming> Super Paper Mario's real-time battle sucked.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I like the filler for it, though.
<Lil_B> I'm not gonna play it, I don't have a 3DS, but I still like it :) even bought the N64 one with the Package last year
<Lil_B> Reggie is such a weird speaker xD
<Spell-of-Gaming> Anyone having graphics issues with Minecraft 1.4.2?
<Lil_B> "Spin trhe System to control a Buddle of water named Eddie, through the Level
<Lil_B> "A Puddle of Water named Eddie"... I think that killed me

<NullRadix> Dear Dari: I'm not sure I can properly build the same level of hate for this character if I'm forced to watch this at 2.5x speed. Perhaps you could slow it down to properly spread the hate?
<prince-dari> Eugh
<prince-dari> Of course.
<prince-dari> Not as though I have anything bad to say about Matt Smith's Doctor anyway.
<Shizuka> 13not at all
<prince-dari> Or this...New intro...
<DoctoDoctorWho> I... I cant watch this.
<DashWithRainbows> Dari, why is your favourite doctor on the stream?
<prince-dari> DashWithRainbows: You weren't there for regs truth or dare, were you?

<NullRadix> Now, I don't know much about the Doctor... but in my limited experience his Time Machine is not... reliably guidable
<Jmo> Oh god really
<Jmo> Dabi, are you streaming?
<prince-dari> ...
<Jmo> Take that as a no.
<prince-dari> I wish I weren't.

<Jmo> Oh.

<prince-dari> Regs were playing truth or dare

<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> <_<
<Jmo> Faaaak
<naturesfury> that blood?
<prince-dari> Looks more like jam
<Jmo> Alien saliva more like it.
<naturesfury> bummer

<Jmo> You guys are dicks.

<NullRadix> and that ladies, is why you handcuff your man to the plumbing. Because otherwise he'll disappear
<NullRadix> or break his legs
<naturesfury> wow thats getting annoying
<Lil_B> ahh...
<Colt_Brovakiin> Ohey everyone :)
<Mega_Milk> Colt_Brovakiin: Sup.
<Lil_B> has it been more than 12 years?
<Jmo> So wait which person actually said for him to stream this episode?
<prince-dari> Didn't specify which episode
<Lil_B> I think the Grandma there was the little Girls, buzt thats just guessing
<SpeccyRush> 5 bucks says Meanwhile
<prince-dari> And otakon chose the dare
<Jmo> Oh his life is gonna get alot harder.
<prince-dari> Hell no, Meanwhile would have done something much, much, worse.
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<SpeccyRush> like what dari :S
<Jmo> Hayo GilDash
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya GilDash :)
<Invi> hai GilDash
<Mega_Milk> GilDash: Sup.
<prince-dari> He has something horrible planned for if someone ever chooses dare when it's his choice
<Lil_B> Mihaui GilDash
<prince-dari> God only knows
<Jmo> Ahahaha
<Lil_B> mihau*
<MadSurge> prince-dari: as long as it isn't illegal...
<Invi> who are they?
<Lil_B> Invi this time... not tha BORG
<doctor_whooves127> worst cops ever heck the jadu are better cops
<MadSurge> Invi: jackasses that want the monster of the week imprisoned
<Mega_Milk> Sudden heart attack?
<Lil_B> has the Doctor Heart Problems?
<MadSurge> He's got three hearts anyway
<DashWithRainbows> Dari Suddenly I feel really glad I left that group. Knowing Connor, he'd probably want me to do something that involves spiders.
<prince-dari> You left?
<Jmo> Ohai ashie-poo
<prince-dari> wat
<DashWithRainbows> Yeah.
<prince-dari> When?
<Silver_Spoon> this is...different
<Jmo> Is there a spider hanging above your head ashie-poo?
<Jmo> :>
<doctor_whooves127> umm ok...
<DashWithRainbows> Dari on the 19th.
<prince-dari> Why?
<Mega_Milk> take off the tie....
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^
<MadSurge> The redhead is really cute
<NullRadix> taking off the tie may not be that easy
<DashWithRainbows> I wanted to change a lot of stuff in my life, got bored with that group seeing that I barely said anything in the chat and soon I just felt like leaving.
<Lil_B> I want to believe... wrong show
<NullRadix> if she did it right, both ends of the tie are stuck in that car
<Alchemist> now kiss
<String_Shredder> now do this: http://cheezburger.com/6581616896
<MadSurge> DashWithRainbows: but you're here with us :)
<doctor_whooves127> you could still losen it and slide it off
<Mega_Milk> NullRadix: You can loosen the noose around your neck and slip out easily.
<DashWithRainbows> I was here to begin with, MadSurge, I was just lurking a lot
<DashWithRainbows> like I still do.
<Jmo> sexay lurker ;D
<VenHur> I'm back.
<Colt_Brovakiin> Welcome back VenHur
<VenHur> So, i'm guessting this is the first apperance of the 10th Doctor?
<Mega_Milk> Also seems kinda weird he can carry a sonic screwdriver but he can't carry a pocket knife..
<Jmo> Bingo
<Lil_B> this looks strange xD
<SpeccyRush> DashWithRainbows: why 'Toast'?
<MadSurge> DashWithRainbows: I lurk too, but at least I manage to talk with people often in this chat
<Kimori> oh? whats the occasion?
<Lil_B> NOOOOOooo
<NullRadix> oh, NOW the time is actually counting down
<DashWithRainbows> SpeccyRush, because I ate toast a lot in the middle of classes, my GT on XBL was toast related at the time so my friends just went with that as my nickname.
<MadSurge> I like all the people in this chat :D
<DashWithRainbows> Besides, I really dislike the name "Ashley"
<VenHur> Dat Product Placement
<DashWithRainbows> "Ash" isn't that bad though.
<Jmo> But it's so good ashie-poo.
<Jmo> :3
<Mega_Milk> porn
<naturesfury> that pink room...
<Mega_Milk> -lol
<SpeccyRush> DashWithRainbows: suddenly in a sharing mood eh :S
<DashWithRainbows> You asked, I answered.
<Jmo> dabi what'd you do to him?
<Blako> you mean the holidays?
<Lil_B> but his Desktop was oddly non-cluddered
<DashWithRainbows> Besides, I'm in a somewhat good mood since I found out I'm doing well in college via review session.
<Jmo> Ahahaha chav doing good in school.
<DashWithRainbows> IKR?
<Jmo> That's a good one.
<SpeccyRush> DashWithRainbows: I did, but you're the one that mentioned Ashley, instead of say Ash
<Invi> where does the doctor come from?
<prince-dari> Gallifrey
<Jmo> Damn you dabi
<Lil_B> send the Varus Vide Radio xD
<Blako> if yes, then it is just autumn holidays.
<Blako> brb
<DashWithRainbows> Meh, still part of the story, Speccy. If I liked my name, I wouldn't have wanted the nickname.
<Lil_B> Virus*
<prince-dari> Ash just doesn't want people to bother him for autographs when he's trying to complete his quest to become a pokemon master
<NullRadix> "Let's do this" great inspirtational
<naturesfury> he those ponies.
<naturesfury> he saw*

<UIquiorra_Cifer> 0612:'D
<prince-dari> The Dudesons are way more insane
<Saturn> 08,01UK curry is kinda rubbish
<Sonny> na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na Sonny!
<Kurra> o.o?
<Ulquiorra_Cifer> 3How the- o.o
<Jake> and noone ever dies
<Saturn> 08,01most UK food is, tbh
<Snow> a little bit
<Dashie_Dashie> Dudesons are the definition of "YOLO"
<MadSurge> Colt_Brovakiin: do they do less shit that involve piss and assholes? :D
<Snow> the human body amazes me
<Saturn> 08,01but there are some exceptions
<Ulquiorra_Cifer> 3*ulquiorra_dance*
<Saturn> 08,01Kurra: if you're ever in Edinburgh, go to the Mosque Kitchen
<Sonny> <3
<Saturn> 08,01they do really good curries
<Kurra> I think I would like curry, except that maybe it all tastes... it just burns, even the non-spicy stuff.
<Kurra> okie :>
<Colt_Brovakiin> MadSurge: Yep :P and they hurt themselfs alot more :D
<Dashie_Dashie> Saturn.
<Jake> these are just guys that continuosly prove they have god mode cheats
<Dashie_Dashie> wut r u doing
<Saturn> 08,01Kurra: i'm kinda immune to chilli

<prince-dari> Kurra: What are you talking about?
*Saturn 08,01grew up with lots of indian food
<MadSurge> Colt_Brovakiin: well, I can endure light wounds. :S
<prince-dari> You can get really mild curries that aren't spicy at all
<MadSurge> *:D
<Kurra> Yeah!
<Kurra> And those are spicy even.
<prince-dari> ...
<Dashie_Dashie> Runrunrunrunrunrun
<Saturn> 08,01korma's not too spicy
<prince-dari> Except they aren't
<Kurra> VERY FEW are not spicy.
<Jmo> LOL
<prince-dari> If they are, then a fucking banana is
<pot80_MCproject> gogogogogogogog
<Invi> what is the point in not spicy curry?
<Jmo> AHAHAHA
<Jake> :D
<Sonny> lol this vid :p
<Snow> :D
<Colt_Brovakiin> MadSurge: :P
<Saturn> 08,01obviously, it depends on how it's made
<SpeccyRush> prince-dari: everyone has different tolerances :P
<Dashie_Dashie> LOL
<Saturn> 08,01and everyone feels chilli differently
<Dashie_Dashie> This guy is my hero
<Kurra> prince-dari, that is my palate and I shall not apologize for it.
<Kurra> XD
<prince-dari> Yes, but if they don't have anything like chilis in
<Eli> no chance
<prince-dari> Which a lot of curries don't
<prince-dari> Then how can you still call them spicy?
<Dashie_Dashie> GOTTA RUN FAST.
<Blako> the one who will tell me what animal is in the following chars will get a cookie: 
<Kurra> because they are spicy to me D:
<Kurra> they burn.
<prince-dari> ...
<Jake> why is this hilarious
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: most curries contain either chilli or pepper
<prince-dari> There are tons that don't
<Dashie_Dashie> I wear stetsons.
<Blako> if you see only squares, you won't get any :D
<Kurra> I dunno what is in them, but apart from the spice thye tasty....
<Dashie_Dashie> stetsons are cool.
<Stormy`> Blacko: I just see 
<Kurra> I want curry sherpherd's PUMPKIN PIE :D
<Cades> trees :p
<Stormy`> *Blako'
<Blako> and the animal name is?

<Kurra> D8
<Kurra> GUYS
<Renji_Abarai> 4Yay! My Ryuk is scanned!
<Blako> no trees
<Dashie_Dashie> This man would make rainbow dash proud.
<Stormy`> I dunno, I can't see the actual characters
<Kurra> curry pumpkin PIE GUYS
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: nope; most masalas invariably contains chilli or pepper
<Cades> i just see trees
<Saturn> 08,01and since pretty much all indian cooking uses masalas
<UIquiorra_Cifer> 0612Now I don't even need to have the same nick to confuse everyone :D
<prince-dari> Just because a lot do, doesn't mean plenty don't
<Dashie_Dashie> Fuken chiken nuggets
<Blako> :D I don't know why, but I can see butterflies there
<Snow> fuuuuuuckiiing chiiiicken nuuugets
<prince-dari> English and Indian curry are two entirely different things anyway
<Blako> 
<Kurra> apart from curry, someday I'd like to go to the UK and just try all manner of foods and beers that accompany them well :>
<String_Shredder> fucking chicken nuggets
<Eli> he's UKs Remi Gaillard huh?
<Blako> :D
<prince-dari> Dat running up a vertical cliff face
<Dashie_Dashie> awww snap
<Stormy`> oh, I thought my client was being stupid again
<MadSurge> AWW SHIT NIGGA
<Dashie_Dashie> Dayum.
<Snow> its like a mankey!
<Stormy`> Usually it shows special characters as a combination of random symbols
<Jmo> MANKEY.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: trust me on this, my mum is an Indian chef. there are practically no curry dishes that don't contain chilli
<Everlasting_Joy> Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what ever a spider can. . .
<Saturn> 08,01it's used for flavour, not just hotness
<Colt_Brovakiin> DAMN THEM MANKEYS!
<Renji_Abarai> 4Yep.. :D
<prince-dari> [19:03] <prince-dari> English and Indian curry are two entirely different things anyway
<Kandarihu> Is there any chance that Shizuka might be streaming tonight?
<Saturn> 08,01English curry is not curry
<Kurra> :(
<Blako> yeah
<Kurra> I thought it was.
<Jmo> English 'curry'
<prince-dari> Well, except we call it curry
<Dashie_Dashie> So any east coast bronies ready for that hurricane?
<Shizuka> 13maybe
<ThePillowship|Away> Dashie_Dashie, what hurricane?
<Saturn> 08,01well, it's not what i'd call curry
<ThePillowship|Away> I wasn't aware of any hurricane.
<Invi> Dashie_Dashie, a hurycurrycane :D
<BladedWings> Dashie_Dashie: there's a hurricane?
<Blako> ⌨⌨⌨ :D
<Eli> Saturn: and then there's also the german curry :P doesn't taste like curry, but germans are famous for it
<MadSurge> Dashie_Dashie: maybe Nittany_Discord will watch its movements :D
<Invi> Currywurst ^^
<Dashie_Dashie> appearently there's a hurricane hitting by monday that's the worst we've seen hit the east coast since 1991
<Blako> so now the image changed
<Snow> O.o\
<Kurra> I thought UK foods were like Indian. 'cuz you know, it'd be cool to try somthing awesome that people go to little holes in the wall for, little places that make great foods...
<Snow> dat time
<SpeccyRush> Invi: hah :D... wait im east coast
<Blako> what is it now?
<Eli> Invi: yep
<pot80_MCproject> he may look good but what about the guy who was filming it?
<Cades> keyboards
<BladedWings> Dashie_Dashie: wait what!?
<ThePillowship|Away> Dashie_Dashie, crap. What's the name of this hurricane? Let me tell my sis cause she has class Monday
<Blako> Yay :) you're right
<Dashie_Dashie> Hurricane Sandy.
<Dashie_Dashie> of all hurricanes.
<Saturn> 08,01Kurra: UK food basically consists of taking something and boiling it without salt
<prince-dari> The guy filming it was using tons of safety equipment, you can bet on that.
<Sosuke_Aizen> 5You are all part of my plan.
<Colt_Brovakiin> I love russell howard :3
<MadSurge> Yay, this program! :D
<Invi> Eli, well it's actually just the spice we call curry that we put in ^^
<Kurra> Saturn, awwh, there has to be awesome things....
<ThePillowship|Away> Dashie_Dashie: Fuck, fuck fucity fuck. Welp!
<Saturn> 08,01Kurra: roasts
<Saturn> 08,01that's all this country can do well
<Stormy`> .__.
<Saturn> 08,01and sausages
<Kurra> I know there are and I'm forgetting what they are
<Kurra> anyway
<Eli> Invi: it doesn't taste bad, just not like curry should to me
<Renji_Abarai> 0614It's an evil plan
<Saturn> 08,01and even then, we don't do sausages as good as Germany
<Sosuke_Aizen> 5Renji_Abarai..you have been part of my plan from the beginning..
*Kurra changed the topic of channel again :)
<Blako> @_@ am I the only one who don't know who is who?
*Kurra wins :)
<prince-dari> Eh, I prefer normal sausages to bratwursts
<Dashie_Dashie> is this the English version of "The soup" that america has?
<Jake> yay deutschland
<Kurra> but do want roasts and... pie.
<Sosuke_Aizen> 5That is also part of my plan. You have no need to worry.
<pot80_MCproject> Russel Howard? aint nobody got time for that!
<Colt_Brovakiin> :D
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: Germany has many, many, many kinds of sausage
<Eli> Saturn: I prefer Swiss sausages over german ones. not only because i'm swiss
<Snow> O.o
<Saturn> 08,01not just Bratwurst
<Dashie_Dashie> BRATWURST.
<Renji_Abarai> 065yes, and you're part of my plan too..
<Dashie_Dashie> Is best sausage.

<Eli> Dashie_Dashie: but you don't live there?
<Dashie_Dashie> with pretzel bread
<Dashie_Dashie> omgggg delicious
<Invi> I don't like Knackwurst. Käsewurst is better ^^
<Stormy`> I can only tell because one of them is BlueFusionFlare@host
<Sosuke_Aizen> 5I know that..It was part of my plan to be part of your plan of being part of my plan.
<Blako> alright then, I'll make plan too
<Jake> There was this PR gag with a "wurst case"
<Dashie_Dashie> I lived there until I was 4, Eli.

<Kandarihu> Alright. You know where I read that Dr Who started off as an educational series? It's TV Tropes.
<Sosuke_Aizen> 5o.o
<Dashie_Dashie> Doctor who makes me think.
<Dashie_Dashie> about the universe
<Dashie_Dashie> n' stuff.
<Kandarihu> Here's what the Doctor Who article says:
<Kandarihu> Early Installment Weirdness: The show was originally conceived of as a strictly children's program with a strong educational component. Several early episodes take place in a "real-world" historical setting, with the only "sci fi" element being how the characters got there. The Doctor is prone to making speeches about how things work (though only if it serves the plot; he only ever breaks the fourth wall once, to wish viewers a Merry Christm
<Kandarihu> as in a 1965 episode). This has all but disappeared even a few seasons in, with it becoming a pure adventure show. The last purely historical storyline, The Highlanders, aired in 1966, though a one-off return to the format, Black Orchid, appeared in 1982.
<Colt_Brovakiin> dat wall of text...
<Jmo> o_O
<Dashie_Dashie> A man in a time traveling phone booth.
<Kandarihu> I should've warned about it ahead of time. Sorry

<Kjakings> 7[censored] you, Hail/Malefor :P
<DaringDerpy> before they close the vote process again
<Kjakings> 7Man how many times did Hail commit suicide in here? bitch was crazy
<Stormy> She did that?
<Stormy> wow
<Stormy> Must not've been paying attention at those points...
<DaringDerpy> one day, you will watch rain man
<DaringDerpy> and you will like it, because it is awesome
<Lil_B> same as allways, Metropolis, The Trixxer, and a random Ponmy Episode
<Kjakings> 7Her 'seventeen year old sister' came in to yell at one point
<Lil_B> Rain Man is good :)
<Stormy> I do remember that
<MecidTheGermanBrony> That's not even a punishment
<Kjakings> 7that was funny
<pot80_MCproject> damn I still can't vote :'(
<Stormy> Or maybe I'm getting it confused with Mysterious Cynder's "dad" sending emails about why she got banned
<Stormy> Or why her thread got locked... or something
<Kjakings> 7Well yes Stormy-poo you were not the most attentive admin. As long as someone (usually me) wasn't going /off the fucking walls/ you didn't do much more than peek in. although my memory is shite beyond shite and that was like three years ago
<Stormy> I thought MC was more annoying than either Malefor or Hail honestly
<Kjakings> 7They were all too annoying.
<Stormy> Okay now I don't even remember what my modding style was like
<Kjakings> 7I performed a sacred duty for this place.
<Kjakings> 7Sacrificed myself day and night
<Kjakings> 7Got no thanks.
<Kjakings> 7Ingrates.
<Stormy> I remember getting told I'm abusing power plenty of times
<DaringDerpy> look before you sleep is a good episode. none of them understands anything of the others. they don't get anything, but they get along anyway
<Stormy> But I really don't think I banned a lot of people except for like Ayumi
<Kjakings> 7... tbh sounds like something I'd say.
<DaringDerpy> +s
<Stormy> Yeah, I think like 50% of it was you
<Invi> hey Lil_B I just found a Gronkh Gangam style... lol
<Stormy> lol
<DaringDerpy> mecid, you call yourself germanbrony...where from?
<MecidTheGermanBrony> Germany.
<Lil_B> Invi oh Oo
<Stormy> 25% was probably Hail being jealous of mods
<Invi> ikr?
<Invi> it's actually pretty good animated ^^
<Lil_B> Invi I do not care about him :S sorry :(
<NullRadix> DaringDerpy: that and it has an EXCELLENT abridged version in the mentally advanced series
<DaringDerpy> MecidTheGermanBrony: specifically?
<Invi> yeah but it shows still that the gangam style stuff doesn't stop for nothing Lil_B ^^
<Invi> *anything
<Invi> *whatever
<MecidTheGermanBrony> No cause i live in germany
<DaringDerpy> NullRadix: not sure if I want to see it...never heard of this series though
<Invi> MecidTheGermanBrony, yeah but where in germany?
<MecidTheGermanBrony> Gelsenkirchen
<MecidTheGermanBrony> That's where i live
<bicyclerepairman> wooo
<bicyclerepairman> Ruhrgebiet!
<Lil_B> Invi good :/ ... btw can you stil access this Video? I wanted to look at a Gangnam Style Video erlier today and... well... GEMA
<MecidTheGermanBrony> Ruhrgebiet for President

<NullRadix> DaringDerpy: Mentally Advanced Series, done by the same guy as the Rainbow Dash Presents series if you've seen those
<Invi> Lil_B, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xQPVtGT78k
<Lil_B> Mittlehessen Links :P
<Invi> Saarland ^^
<MecidTheGermanBrony> Bochum for the win!
<DaringDerpy> NullRadix: no, haven't seen this either...doesn't seem to be popular or well known in this community
<Invi> and so he left :D
<bicyclerepairman> he got so excited...
<Invi> hehe
<DaringDerpy> I am too drunk now, I will check it out tomorrow morning
<Kjakings> 7hehe
<Eli> alexxm: ah now i found out what you meant with Puff the magic dragon :) didn't get it 'till i googled
<DaringDerpy> I suppose they set their focus on idiot bookworm twilight?
<Eli> alexxm: but Piff is someone else. that's him http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=kk5xfK0ovrk
<Invi> no, twily is actually banished from canterlot in that series as far as i know DaringDerpy
<Eli> he looks like crackle, right?
<bicyclerepairman> there are a lot of Saarland bronies afaik
<NullRadix> DaringDerpy yeah they kinda slowed down so there's very little momentum behind them, I'm not surprised its a little obscure
<Amu-chan> Going idle. Although it probably seemed like I was idle already. XP
<Invi> there are? cool
<DaringDerpy> hm...sounds interesting
<MrBen> Hey guys, sorry to drop in with this but I didn't this listed in the FAQ. What was the time limit for entering in the lottery tonight? I know today's the last day to enter before tomorrow's stream...
<alexxm> dinner back soon
<DaringDerpy> tomorrow ^^
<NullRadix> but they did 9 abridged episodes and 5 fanfiction parodies. I'm sure several other people around here remember them
<NullRadix> 5ish...
<NullRadix> I'm guessing there
<Invi> i found in a forum thar there should be about 2 or 3 in my town
<Invi> NullRadix, they are working on My little dashie atm
<bicyclerepairman> it's what I recall, at least... Almost everyone I talked to in another channel, back when it was active, came out of the Saarland
<DaringDerpy> MrBen: the limit is when you can send the form without "lottery closed" answer
<BladedWings> aaaaand flash crash :P
<Invi> bicyclerepairman, where were you? ^^
<NullRadix> Invi: oh dear
<NullRadix> Rainbow Dash Presents: My Little Dashie?
<bicyclerepairman> mh? I'm in Bochum right now
<DaringDerpy> worked for me 10 or so minutes ago, MrBen
<Invi> NullRadix, with petirep as animator, everything will wbe awesome ^^
<Invi> bicyclerepairman, yeah, i meant the channel :P
<bicyclerepairman> oh
<MrBen> Yeah, my responses went through earlier because I did the same thing 'bout 10 minutes myself
<bicyclerepairman> #ponyboard.de, but it's beyond dead by now
<DaringDerpy> time to gently fall over and sleep like a bear
<Invi> bicyclerepairman, just now or lately?
<DaringDerpy> good night everyone...everypony...and the rest
<DaringDerpy> :)
<Invi> nighty DaringDerpy

<BladedWings> RoboGerbil: its cool, just being friendly ^_^
<Dashie_Dashie> yup.
<Dashie_Dashie> it's delicious.
<NullRadix> They're alright. Good enough to practically live on while dieting
<Dashie_Dashie> I needed something to eat.
<Dashie_Dashie> my headache was telling me too.
<NullRadix> You could do much, much worse
<DoctoDoctorWho> No srsly, what went on while I was out?
<Dashie_Dashie> Yes, I could
<Dashie_Dashie> >Yellow Curry sauce.
<Dashie_Dashie> >Tastes like farts.

<DoctoDoctorWho> yeah, and ya know what's the cure for quiet chat?
<Dashie_Dashie> that doesn't sound bueno
<NullRadix> DoctoDoctorWho: a party?

<rdibp> ALL CAPS?
<DoctoDoctorWho> NERD DEBATES!!
<Jmo> Dat Pondoo.
<rdibp> :$....wait?
<NullRadix> so....
<rdibp> :|
<Eli> Dashie_Dashie: you're writing fics? show me i'm bored
<NullRadix> Java vs C#? Photoshop vs SAI? fanfiction.net vs fimfiction?
<Dashie_Dashie> Alright, I know most of you don't like R34, but there was a thread on /mlp/ where people used NSFW pictures to go on Omegel, and my god I have never laughed so hard in my life.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Anypony got some juicy material to argue about?
<BladedWings> off to class guys...see yall later tonight ^_^
<rdibp> Dashie_Dashie: what were you doing on /mlp/?
<Dashie_Dashie> being a writefag.
<Eli> Dashie_Dashie: ah... have you got anything non-clop?
<Dashie_Dashie> I don't have any clop in my stories.
<Eli> Dashie_Dashie: ok. then i would love to read
<Dashie_Dashie> It's based on the thread "Anon in Equestria" if you don't mind reading that.
<Moopy> Brb going to go make me a sandvich
<Dashie_Dashie> it's SFW
<Eli> Dashie_Dashie: sounds like HiE
<Kurra> mud
<Dashie_Dashie> AiE was wayyyyyyy before HiE.
<Saturn> 08,01save me barry
<Dashie_Dashie> that's where I've spent the last few months.
<Saturn> 08,01!
<Dashie_Dashie> waiting for the new season
<Eli> Dashie_Dashie: it's Human in Equestria though? right?
<DoctoDoctorWho> I have a fic of my own but it doesnt seem very popular
<rdibp> hai Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01hullo!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<Eli> DoctoDoctorWho: tell me it's name and i'll see to one more view for you
<Dashie_Dashie> In a sense, yes Eli.
<Kurra> :o
<Kurra> I bbl all!
<rdibp> so is this what Bronystate is usually like on weekdays? cause im usually here on weekends.
<Eli> DoctoDoctorWho: except if it's clop or HiE. that stuff smells
<Dashie_Dashie> Bronystate has it's ups and downs on the weekdays.
<Dashie_Dashie> mostly because of the lack of streaming
<Dashie_Dashie> >because real life is neat.
<alexxm> how are things Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> things are good alexxm :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> I can link if you guys want, And Ohai Saturn :)
<Eli> DoctoDoctorWho: i sure want
<Kammerjunk> Real Life: The world's most popular MMO since 2.5 million BC
<Dashie_Dashie> The lack of moonbutt threads on /mlp/ rustles my jimmies.
<Dashie_Dashie> Time to fix that.
<DoctoDoctorWho> K, brb. But b4 I get it I have a thing or 2 to say about fics. First off, your right, Clop isnt right(shipping is tho, tee-hee). Second off, HiE isnt suckish, I actually quite like them. Third, my fic involves making blueblood not seem like a jerk. Hope you enjoy Eli!
<NullRadix> HiE is not necessarily suckish. Just about any concept can be done right
<NullRadix> they can all be done horribly, horribly wrong though
<Eli> DoctoDoctorWho: ok, i have read some making blueblood not a jerk. He still is in my books. doesn't matter though. I don't like HiE, because every single HiE i've seen so far were random shipping oneself with HiE and sorry that sucks. Third I don't like clop much. but i make exceptions. University nights is hardly clop though
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D now i wanna make a gaming pc for THIS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMJIIuKJaBg&list=FLIWobWFql_3X0c2sKFQCW1Q&index=1&feature=plpp_video Fus Ro yay~
<Kammerjunk> I'm currently following a HiE where the guy was turned into a Changeling. Hasn't updated in a while, but what he has written is brilliant. So much delicious headcanon.
<DoctoDoctorWho> There are some great ones, read the brony international gaurd
<DoctoDoctorWho> its awesome
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, that one's great. Then again, it's by the same guy who did a Dresden Files/MLP crossover.
<NullRadix> Kammerjunk: did or is doing?
<Eli> Kammerjunk: that doesn't sound too bad. I just don't like actual HUMANS in pony stories. especialy when shiping is involved. that doesn't work out
<NullRadix> I believe I was aware of two Dresden crossovers... I'm tracking one of them, not sure about the other
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/49494/Blueblood-Un-jerked And off with you! I await your return and tales of your story in, BLUEBLOOD UNJERKED!
<Kammerjunk> NullRadix: He completed one, and he might have completed another one, but he might be done with that one too.
<Kammerjunk> Hold on, I have it somewhere in my fanfic folder.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I intend to make a 40k crossover once this fic is done.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, he completed one Dresen Files crossover, and is doing another.
<Kammerjunk> Dresden*
<NullRadix> Kammerjunk: the one I'm reading (I'm pretty sure it didn't finish...) picks up... hrm... the Ice Queen he is apparently in servitude to (not sure how canon that scenario is) sends him off to intervene with the MLP world because the "Nickleheads" are messing around with the MLP world
<Lil_B> damn the Stream has been dead the last few days :/
<Bronysith> a
<rdibp> b
<Lil_B> c
<rdibp> d
<Dashie_Dashie> Tomorrow is defintely going to be lulz worthy..
<Kammerjunk> NullRadix: Don't think it's the same one. It's a guy called psychicscubadiver.
<Dashie_Dashie> >2012 the movie
<Dashie_Dashie> Deargod
<DoctoDoctorWho> Imma gonna jump on the "space marine in equestria" bandwagon
<Dashie_Dashie> and it's the shitty 2012 too.
<rdibp> i wish i can make it to movie nights. my last one was months ago. ;-;
<Dashie_Dashie> I know someone who did an amazing space marine crossover DoctorDoctorWho.
<rdibp> *confession bear look* i actually liked 2012
<Eli> waitwaitwait. we're watching 2012?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, and let's not forget Through the Eyes of Another Pony. Think Wrek did the art for that one.
<Tovler> 2012 was ok. the last act kinda dragged on.
<Dashie_Dashie> it's not the 2012 with massive amounts of CGI.
<rdibp> 2012 was okay for a disaster movie
<NullRadix> Kammerjunk: synopsis on that one? I remember the name...
<Dashie_Dashie> Trust me, I know exactly which one it is.
<Kammerjunk> I watched 2012 once. I think it was pretty bland, because I can't remember anything about it.
<Dashie_Dashie> if it's on the b list.
<Eli> Tovler: 2012 was certainly not ok... it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen
<rdibp> i remember years ago when people were freaking out about 2012. Now its a month away and no one gives a s*yay*
<Tovler> Well, I watch a lot of movies
<Malavolent> Evening, everybrony.
<rdibp> evening Maavolent
<Eli> 2012 was badly made, completely over the top and totally ilocical
<rdibp> Malavolent*
<Lil_B> still Robert Emmerich > Michael Bay
<Sonny> Helllloooooooooowwwww PONYVILE!
<Lil_B> hi Malavolent
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol all these disaster movie are so dull :D all they do is encourage paranoid people like those ones on tlc who have all that canned food and gas masks and what not
<Sonny> i mean bronystate..
<Lil_B> and hi Sonny
<Sonny> heya ya'll :)
<Malavolent> Heya, Lil_B.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dashie_Dashie: what was it called?
<Kammerjunk> NullRadix: Description is too long for me to post here, so http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/story-through-eyes-of-another-pony.html
<rdibp> Sonny: you're in bronystate :D
<Sonny> I corrected myself rdibp :p
<Sonny> pppst, pssst

<Sonny> <_<?
<Dashie_Dashie> "Thousand Son in Equestria"
<Lil_B> Sonny I saw your Featherfront Picture
<rdibp> no <_<
<Lil_B> Weatherfront*
<Malavolent> Mods are asleep, post ponies.
<Sonny> weatherfront picture?
<Eli> Pan's Labyrinth makes up for it though. but seriously, how could Sumica chose 2012?
<Sonny> the one from Nittany?
<Kammerjunk> I haven't been on the EQD frontpage since for one and a half month.
<Lil_B> Sonny yes
<Sonny> Lil_B: oh yes that one :D
<NullRadix> hrm... I thought that had a Human/Luna shipping element... doesn't seem to now though...
<Kammerjunk> Because S3.
<rdibp> Eli: its bad movie night i guess
<Dashie_Dashie> Bad movies are the best though.
<Lil_B> Sonny the Eyes... They always look so creepy to me!
<Tovler> bad movies are B
<Dashie_Dashie> usually bronystate memes come from bad movies.
<Kammerjunk> NullRadix: Oh, it has Human/Luna alright.
<Eli> rdibp: pan's labyrinth isn't that bad
<rdibp> i love watching bad movies with other people anyway :)
<Sonny> Lil_B: that's because they're wide open and they're small pupils :D
<Dashie_Dashie> THICK MC'RUNFAST.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I dunno which leigon to choose tho,
<Dashie_Dashie> oh that was a night to remember..
<alexxm> rdibp i saw pans labryinth in my media class and i liked it
<Sonny> Lil_B: I usually do that xp
<Moopy> aight im back and i got me a PB and J sandwhiches i was going to make some ham sandwhiches but there was no ham just swiss cheeses thats all so yeah
<DoctoDoctorWho> chapter, pardon me
<Eli> Kammerjunk: oh human/my favourite pony... *get my shotgun*
<Lil_B> Sonny I know, but ALWAYS xD
<rdibp> alexxm: so i guess its sorta good sorta bad movie night
<Sonny> Lil_B: :p I know I know, I'll try to make them less creepier next time :p

<Eli> Vordox: it is! no more hetero marriages!
<Blako> I have to go now, bye
<Malavolent> And thousands of shippers rejoiced.
<Eli> Malavolent: youp. kinda why i said it
<Vordox> NO MORE HETERO MARRIAGES ARE ALLOWED
<TheMaster> you'll be sad in the inevitable shipping episode in which every member of the main cast gets a male counterpart

<String_Shredder> Invi: WAT.

<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 15 days, 18 hours, 26 minutes, 44 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
<Vordox> When you have a tongue twister as a VA: Stuff happens
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84kgxV-j61M
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im just curious can multiple devices connected to one network strain the network?
<Starlight> Depends on what the devices are asking.
<alexxm> you know motorhead made a song about the game
<Starlight> If they're just little things like Cellphones, then you need about 20 of them or so. If they're laptops streaming say Netflix, then yeah, it'll not only strain the network, but also the modem(s).
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well I have 2 computers connected for school
<Michael> router will burn!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> my dads laptop, my parents ipads
<Starlight> Routers don't burn. :P
<Starlight> Then you should be okay.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My laptop that runs wow..
<Starlight> Routers advertise their max up/down speed, which is, an example; 10/100 mbps.
<Bronysith> I like swords
<Michael> lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> Anti-spiral is a true brony. He exploded twice, twice. Resulting in a culminated total of 4 explosions.

<Michael> SpadeMagnes[School]: RAM and CPU?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And now the thing is running like shit

<Sonny> ping me if you need me ^^
<Saturn> 08,01alexxm: yup

<Vordox> Saturn: Sometimes there's audio lag, but most often it's a very heavy stutter or stream freezes for a second, but the audio stutters as well as the stream visuals.
<AJIsAwesome> Ninja Gaiden Challenge?
<Pink3> When is the next bronycon??? im probably gonna go
<Amu-chan> I don't remember BlueFlare! But that should be obvious.
<Lil_B> Sonny I dunno, your picture, I just think that you should try and make it as insane-creepy looking as possible if that's the goal
<SpadeMagnes[School]> AMD E-300 APU with radeon HD graphics 1.3 GHz for the processor
<thelonepony> somewhere in the late summer
<SpadeMagnes[School]> 2.00 GB of RAM
<Starlight> Thaaaaaaats why it's slow.
<Starlight> VERY
<Starlight> slow
<Sonny> Lil_B: it was just to troll you Lil_B xD
<Starlight> Windows 7? Vista?

<alexxm> i know the next BUCK is near the end of august
<Sonny> Lil_B: btw I'm colouring it now, don't woryy :p

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqUrUWxXM78
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My other laptop for wow runs on vista
<Starlight> Windows 7 is a memory hog.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And its starting to be slow as fuck
<Lil_B> Sonny sry, I cant detect Trolls when I have to focus at 3 SThings at once xD
<alexxm> hm has highlander been streamed

<thelonepony> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Christopher Walkenthrough :D
<Michael> lmao
<Paspie> yeah try opensuse
<alexxm> hm has highlander been streamed
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I may be super paranoid but if one computer in a network gets a virus can the other computers or devices get it as well?
<Starlight> Nope.
<Michael> ^
<Starlight> DESPITE what other people here might say. No.
<Sonny> Lil_B: no problem lil ;p
<Starlight> You have to manually transfer the virus over.
<pony_1709> no stream?
<Michael> nope
<thelonepony> not atm
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ok then because My wow had a virus that mysteriously vanished over night
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So Im suspecious its not gone...
<DashWithRainbows> do a scan?
<Starlight> .. and you wonder why your laptop is running slow?
<Starlight> Get an antivirus, there's two free choices.
<Lil_B> ok Invi it's uploading now, only 1.9 MB bit it seems it' ssgetting a lot of interruption
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well the computer is old
<Starlight> AVG or avast!, either are good.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> like 5 or 6 years or so
<Michael> i liek avast
<Invi> Lil_B, how long 'till finish?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> it has SecureIT
<Starlight> I do as well, Michael.
<Lil_B> Invi or... just go too sleep, xD I can show you another time
<Invi> okay ^^
<Starlight> Well, I never heard of SecureIT. Might want to get rid of it.

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Isnt avast the one with the very loud the virus database has been updated thing?
<Starlight> Yes, but you can turn it off.
<thelonepony> Night Invi :)
<Starlight> Look into getting a decent anti virus and track that virus down. If you really think your computer still has the virus, find the recovery CD for your laptop and reformat it.
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Invi. :)
<Starlight> But that's the most extreme case you should ever do.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well I may be getting a new computer this christmass so I shouldent worry too much

<Stormy> "things"... I didn't even try to do that

<AJIsAwesome> Coldays: The other one shouldn't be forced into it, IMO.
<Michael> brb
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Theres stuff I cant acess with out a unova link key
<Bronysith> i like swords
<AJIsAwesome> I think he should see the show when he wants to.
<Coldays> its more of a all his friends are bronys so he wants to see why
<[Alpha]> I kind of still like Pokemon but they seem to be running out of ideas for Pokemon
<Coldays> and i shall show him
<Michael> and back
<AJIsAwesome> Coldays: Ah, now I see what you mean.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Again my argument for saying pokemon is running out of ideas look at gen 1
<Panda|Drawing> hello CCCP ^^
<Cades> I feel the urge to go skate for a bit
<AJIsAwesome> And gen 2.
<CrimsonPhoenix> >MFW I've got outbid by a guy that bid 500
<CCCP> <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah fuck you too ebay

<Eli> CrimsonPhoenix: on what?
<Michael> best Gen are 1-2
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm highest for now
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Ouch. What were you trying to get?

<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-little-pony-FIM-plush-Hoodie-and-socks-Lyra-large-handmade-plushie-17-/271087991810
<Coldays> 500? on what
<Panda|Drawing> CrimsonPhoenix you bidded on that?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I WANT THAT
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have to wonder when was the first episode of pokemon released?
<[Alpha]> Not gonna lie I would buy it too.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Was Gold/Silver in production at that time? Because Ho-oh was in it
<Panda|Drawing> SpadeMagnes[School] september 5th 97 I believe.
<Eli> CrimsonPhoenix: for 500? well you are bound to make the creator happy
<Panda|Drawing> no ho oh was just a random pokemon that became a legendary later.
<Michael> http://www.etsy.com/listing/110965346/twilight-sparkle-custom-plush-pony-mlp
<Panda|Drawing> i believe that it wasnt meant that way, it was only meant to be symbolic. iirc
<[Alpha]> They had a Derpy for bid as well but they bought it already :(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also apperently Gen1 had several pokemon that got cut and put in Gen 2
<CrimsonPhoenix> Michael, lol black hair

<Cypresswolf> I kinda forgot about this but, for those who want to play season 3 bingo - http://texasbronygroup.4umer.com/t91-season-3-bingo-in-progress - you can pick any of these or add your own and put them in any order you want - standard 5 x 5 bingo card
<Cypresswolf> I need to make my card :)
<Cypresswolf> those are just things I thought right after S2 finale through august before running out of ideas
<DerpyMuffins> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 15 days, 17 hours, 22 minutes, 21 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
<Eli> Cypresswolf: why don't you just wait and see what yo get?
<DerpyMuffins> Only 15 days mroe
<Cypresswolf> :) I thought it would be fun
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wait when exactly on the 10th is it airing?
<DerpyMuffins> S3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The usual 12:00?
<Cypresswolf> of course there is a hidden rule - if even one of those is right (free space - there will be ponies) everypony wins :P

<FlutterMEDIC> SpadeMagnes[School]: from what i've seen (and i've seen a little) they are a bit more competent than the other organizations
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I can say Magma/aqua is really incompetent
<DerpyMuffins> Is there a stream?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They nearly doomed the world because they grabbed the wrong fucking orbs
<Stormy> sup

<Vordox> Your english is... not that readable.^^
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: My little brother loves using Bisharp. :D
<Kjakings> 7No. She just basically realised that the relationship had lasted six months, got really scared because all of a sudden things are /real/, and said a plethora of silly things.
*Socks proves thelonepony wrong by demonstrating on HeavyWeaPony_Guy
<DerpyMuffins> As a British, I find your lack of proper english disturbing

<DerpyMuffins> So some rule 34?
<DerpyMuffins> Been there done that
<Kjakings> 7also this is why I shouldn't talk to people when sleep deprived it's almost as bad as alcohol for that little filter between brain and mouth
<Socks> :D

<AJIsAwesome> pony_124241: So you mean shipping couples?
<Colt_Brovakiin> Goodnight Michael :)

<Stormy> Why the hell do people even get into relationships if they don't want them to last
<DerpyMuffins> BOOO

<Socks> Not gonna happen, fluttershy is a pure flower!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hello? Are you still alive?

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> GEE I WONDER WHAT THIS IS
<alexxm> how've you been TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<DerpyMuffins> Hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> So pony_124241 why dont you make your own name insted of being pony_random#
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the intro would be a bit better if it was cut after the first chorus
<Stormy> Well if you both have different expectations it's probably best to give it up
<pony_197042> couple 2 soarin and rainbow dash
<Socks> CrimsonPhoenix: I sense a critic of this song.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> alexxm Good i guess, and you ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Socks, I don't mind the song
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm talking about the interview in general
<Vordox> Too many pony random to be able to talk to the guy who asked for help ><
<Socks> Interview?
<CrimsonPhoenix> inb4 what interview
<Kjakings> 7You misunderstand. It was just a momentary freak-out, we're fine now.
<Stormy> Ah okay
<AJIsAwesome> What interview? :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> argh
<CrimsonPhoenix> too late
<Stormy> You mentioned before you were upset about it, so I assumed it was still an issue
<ThePillowship> The interview with Living Tombstone. Duh
<pony_197042> hows that random it could happen
<Socks> Me iz confuzzed
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> its Spitfire and Soarin
<Kjakings> 7and, to be fair, before me she didn't believe in the concept of love and had never been with a man, so y'know I challenge her perceptions of existence a lot.
<pony_197042> shutup marky
<AJIsAwesome> Guys, I don't get it. Who's being interviewed? <_<
<DerpyMuffins> Who do you think?
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> i dont know everybody?
<Socks> Interview! Will someone explain to the n00b here!
<AJIsAwesome> I have no idea. <_<
<Kimori> Is this one of your first conflicts between the two of you?
<Vordox> pony_197042: Change your nick to something so we know who you are before you ask? :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hot to not OC http://littlegrimmie.deviantart.com/art/Zalek-RP-Bio-308057097
<Kjakings> 7Fuck no.

<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> yea Tayler
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> I argue with Lambda all the time about stupid crap
<Stormy> Always turns out fine in the end
<Kjakings> 7Jesus christ man. If a relationship has no fights then it's not a relationship, because nothing is being sorted out. If it's not worth arguing and fighting for, what's the point?

<Stormy> Shut up Kja
<Kjakings> 7We fight a lot. We're both very unstable individuals, and she had to change a lot to adapt to being in a real relationship. Add that to the fact she's my first girlfriend and the insane nervousness that comes with that, things have been rocky a lot.

<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> Still having problem pony_241922
<Stormy> I'm completely oblivious to when people like me
<oni_link> I remembered why I tried steering away from playing FPS titles on Xbox. They make me rage .-.

<Stormy> People tell me some guy is flirting with me and I don't believe them
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ill make sure people don't like me with all my pony swag.
<Kjakings> 7when you catch random year 10s staring at your ass it's hard to ignore.

<Kjakings> 7(Note: year 10s, not ten-year-olds. British 'grade' system: they're about fifteen.)
<Iain> http://cheezburger.com/6697957632 :D it's a MLB post
<Stormy> heh... won't say I can't relate to you there
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I never had confidence issues because I never actually knew how nerdy I was.

<Bronysith> Cypresswolf: that comment gave me cancer
<Iain> it's not a video...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> the only thing that bothered me was when I had bad acne at the beginning of middle school
<Marco> ohai pony_094024 :>

<DerpyMuffins> Hai Vash
<Lunar_Brony> hi Vash
<FlutterMEDIC> derp
<DerpyMuffins> Fly paper?
<Bronysith> NOT FLY PAPER
<Kandarihu> I just saw a frame of something that looks interesting between parts
<BroPony|MEDIC> Hi Vash
<Evilsqirrel> NOT THE BEES!
<Kencolt> I remember this, It's really one of his better plans.
<Lunar_Brony> inb4 he gets stuck to the paper
<AJIsAwesome> You could just use yur laser vision to zap the paper........
<Vash> Evilsqirrel :D
<NullRadix> AJIsAwesome: shush! You're ruining the moment!
<Vash> notice the fly paper is in only a small part of the room
<AJIsAwesome> OKay. :D
<Vash> they could have landed anywhere
<oni_link> also, they can FLY
<BroPony|MEDIC|AFK> man he is REALLY suckin it up
<NullRadix> Vash: they fly in on mojo often enough
<FlutterMEDIC> lordy
<oni_link> or MELT THE PAPER
<Kencolt> You guys have to remember-- in the end thyey are little girls.
<Lunar_Brony> A freakin' mace?
<Evilsqirrel> Man, my childhood had a lot of violence... Much more than I remember.
<AJIsAwesome> Kencolt: True. :D
<FlutterMEDIC> why do you have a sword in your desk....
<Vash> Oh girls, you've fallen from orbit, been blasted and hit by how mnay monsters? and you're afraid of a sword and chainsaw?
<BroPony|MEDIC|AFK> O_o
<Kencolt> NullRadix: And he KNOWS WHERE THEY LAND.
<sonicdude558> inb4 blood
<AJIsAwesome> Vash: Well, they ARE sharp.
<oni_link> lol
<Lunar_Brony> A katana, darts, batttle axe, how much shit does this guy have?
<Kandarihu> Indeed. Why did Mojo Jojo count on the girls landing? Maybe he had plans to force them to the ground if they didn't land.
<Evilsqirrel> Use a spoon!
<BroPony|MEDIC|AFK> a cannon
<FlutterMEDIC> lit bombs, great
<BroPony|MEDIC|AFK> acid?!
<Ponies47> O.O
<FlutterMEDIC> tiger....
<pony_1709> use the lemons
<DerpyMuffins> Tiger?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Me?
<Dken2021> he forgot the kitchen sink
<Evilsqirrel> He gon be trippin wit all dat acid, boy.
<BroPony|MEDIC|AFK> Ok Overkill definition
<oni_link> I like how things could still be violent back then but we didnt have over protective parents getting on the networks cases
<DerpyMuffins> Tac pin?
<AJIsAwesome> Hey, it's Tigger!
<NullRadix> *ahem* as noted. The girls just break in on him often enough. They probably got into a routine. Or we're all overthinking it and should be laughing at Mojo's overconfidence scene
<FlutterMEDIC> HOLY SWEET JESUS
<Vash> you think he would have3 got the stuff together before hand
<Kencolt> Every Known Deathtrap known to villany! This is sheer genius!
<oni_link> i mean and, not but
<Ryunosuke> that cant be a safe place to sit :)
<Shammy> and spasning GO!
<sonicdude558> inb4 processor
<AJIsAwesome> NullRadix: Yeah, I was just joking. :D
<Kandarihu> NullRadix, that's a good explanation there.
<Evilsqirrel> Achievement unlocked: Squirrel
<oni_link> lol
<Vash> its a wonder they didn't like laser the floor and fly with pieces of it stuck to them
<DerpyMuffins> Dat innocent Bubbles
<oni_link> Super Squirrel
<Celestia`s_Bunny> but the girls couldn`t fly out... SEEMS LEGIT
<FlutterMEDIC> oh boy
<DerpyMuffins> They have no friends
<FlutterMEDIC> SQUIRREL TALK
<oni_link> Celestia`s_Bunny: IKR
<Lunar_Brony> she can speak Squirrel?
<Evilsqirrel> Dat Tara Strong.
<Dken2021> well duh
<J_E_Smith71> Do I look like I can speak squirrel?
<Vash> DerpyMuffins that is so sad
<TheMaster> both bubbles and blossom have special abilities
<FlutterMEDIC> Lunar_Brony: she can speak squirrel
<Lunar_Brony> J_E_Smith71 umm, yes?
<TheMaster> but not buttercup for some reason
<Dken2021> it's one of her powers, along with spanish
<Vash> no one at pokeyoaks cares i guess
<sonicdude558> :(
<oni_link> lol
<TheMaster> blossom has ice breath, bubbles can talk to animals and buttercup...can punch things
<Ryunosuke> she... speaks ... squirrel
<J_E_Smith71> Lunar_Brony: I was referencing Twilight's line in Hurricane Fluttershy
<FlutterMEDIC> num
<Shammy> WOO!
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, Proffesor. :D
<Lunar_Brony> OH, right, yeah.
<Syn_Virtu> lol
<Ponies47> Dat phone
<Eli> oh god... power puff girls
<J_E_Smith71> The squrriel just so happens to have PPG bug eyes
<Eli> why am i even awake at this hour?
<Evilsqirrel> Eli: Why not?
<TheMaster> wut
<oni_link> aw
<TheMaster> oh its back
<oni_link> ok
<Vash> I wondor why we never hear about chemical x from any place other than the professor
<sonicdude558> dat stock scream
<alexxm> Vash perhaps he discovered how to make it?
<Dken2021> hahah, he's getting rabies
<TheMaster> because its something the professor invented and then never replicated
<Evilsqirrel> "It fell off a truck, officer. I swear."
<Kencolt> Vash: He's the ONLY one who knows the formula.
<Eli> Evilsqirrel: na, Lil_B and i just noticed the 6th coop test chamber block in Portal2 and we HAD to do them :)
<TheMaster> though they play with chemical X once and awhile. Cue Bunny the retarded power puff girl. that one guy who was evil etc.
<FlutterMEDIC> ew
<AJIsAwesome> ...............
<TheMaster> also the rowdy ruff boys too
<DerpyMuffins> Ew
<NullRadix> tasty
<Ryunosuke> dat .. jealousy?
<Vash> alexxm he's a professor, publishing that knowledge would make his career, his life, and he descorved it then before he made the girols
<sonicdude558> Moral: Use CHEMICAL X on everything
<Dken2021> TheMaster actually they got their powers form a jail toilet
<Vash> man i can't spell today, please excuse me
<TheMaster> because the jail toilet had the same consistency as chemical x for some reason
<alexxm> Vash he probably knows that if something like a super solider serum would end up being used for evil i guess
<BroPony|MEDIC|AFK> Bye everypony, goin airsoft shoppin
<FlutterMEDIC> made from snips, snails, and puppy dog tails, including chemical x
<thelonepony> Bye BroPony|MEDIC|AFK :)

<ThePillowship> Depending on where you live.
<Meanwhile> It looks quite steampunk. Should be interesting. Assuming they don't sell out.

<Meanwhile> So you live on the couch. Basically.
*Dark92Enigma ME: “FINE!” (pause) “So, you coming to the third act to Watch it with me?
<ThePillowship> I have curtains up and it gives my room a red hue.
<ThePillowship> Needs to be darker, since winter is fast approaching.
*Dark92Enigma MOM: “Don’t I always?”
<ThePillowship> I want the dark room to last as long as possible.
*Dark92Enigma ME: COOL
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: There
<Meanwhile> I like winter.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Meanwhile> S'almost Halloween. Who likes Halloween?
<Kandarihu> If I can get my new computer put together, I's also going to be in the living room.
<Randomnerd> I prefer fall.
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE Winter.
<Dken2021> winter's awesome
<ThePillowship> I like Halloween
<AJIsAwesome> I like Fall too. :)
<AJIsAwesome> Halloween's okay.
<Randomnerd> Halloween is my favorite holiday. I'm sick of Christmas.
<Dken2021> actually, Fall's my favorite of the seasons
<ThePillowship> Hopefully if I have enough money after buying my glasses, I'm gonna get my costume
<Kandarihu> Ah, now I see what Shizuka was doing.
<Bronysith> i want thanksgiving so i can get fat
<Dark92Enigma> i like to call it NOSTALGIAWEEN
<twilight_sprinkle> i prefer winter to the smmer, but it depends where yo live. winter can be a pain if everything is covered in ice
<ThePillowship> if it's still in the store, that is << >>
<Meanwhile> Could never be sick of Christmas, but I do like Halloween.
<J_E_Smith71> First half of winter...cool because of Christmas. Rest of it sucks. Too cold, sun goes down too early
<PeachStreak> AJIsAwesome: its just a head I only doodled a head base but it still looks good
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Same.
<Bronysith> christmas is okay...
<Randomnerd> ThePillowship: If you're tight on money, you can buy medical gauze and go as the invisible man.
<ThePillowship> Randomnerd, I dun wanna.
<Cades> the water got shut off for my neighboorhood. They better turn it back on by tomorrow morning or I'm gonna have to go to school with my hair looking like I just woke up :P
<J_E_Smith71> My favorite park looks dead and barren during the winter but great the rest of the year
<Wrek> 05The game was originally set to release before Halloween 2012, but was delayed to early 2013 due to overwhelming response and to meet the expectations.[4]
<Randomnerd> I'm not close to my family, so Christmas is really stressful.
<Wrek> 05in other words
<Wrek> 05machine for pigs could have been out right now
<PeachStreak> what game>
<PeachStreak> ?
<Wrek> 05but alas
<Lunar_Brony> it ain't
<Meanwhile> But wasn't because they wanted it to be good enough? Sounds like a decent reason to me.
<Randomnerd> I like holidays that focus on eating. Halloween and Thanksgiving.
<Meanwhile> Inb4 it's a repeat of Duke Nukem Forever.
<Wrek> 05Meanwhile it is decent
<PeachStreak> oh
<Wrek> 05but if would be perfect timing
<Meanwhile> You wait for like 2 decades and then it just sucks so hard it collapses in on itself and forms a black hole.
<Wrek> 05to release before holloween
<Meanwhile> I'd be happy enough with some more high profile horror movies over this period.
<Meanwhile> All I've heard recently is that Silent Hill 2 is meant to be out soonish.
<Lunar_Brony> oh, I know this one . . .
<ThePillowship> I still need to finish I mean start VVT pony
*PeachStreak Epic dance in minecraft
<Lunar_Brony> umm . . . DAMMIT what's the name of this song?
<Kandarihu> Hm, could it handle the lava? Can it lay tracks over the lava?
<ThePillowship> Or finish grudge pony that I originally sketched.
<ThePillowship> I'm out of ideas.
<Lunar_Brony> Kandarihu it puts down stone and then a rail
<Kandarihu> Lunar_Brony, I see.
<PeachStreak> ThePillowship: VVT pony?
<Dken2021> oklahoma!
<ThePillowship> PeachStreak, were you here when Shizu streamed Harry Potter Rifftrax?
<PeachStreak> nope
<PeachStreak> I just got here
<Shizuka> 13oops
<RDash5000> sup guys.
<Dken2021> allo RDash5000
<ThePillowship> Well...
<Shizuka> 13forgot to step down the voltage on the extractor
<PeachStreak> sup RD
<Dken2021> that happened
<Kandarihu> So it exploded?
<Shizuka> 13this is what i get for running high voltage through my house
<RDash5000> music... sounds so familiar
<Shizuka> 13kept the resin at least
<thelonepony> Hi RDash5000 :)
<ThePillowship> if you're familiar with the Harry Potter series, Lord voldemort is so fearted that people are afraid to say his name
<Meanwhile> Minecraft's looking a lot more complicated than when I last played it. What mods're running on this?
<PeachStreak> ohh
<ThePillowship> So when people start to say it, it starts off as "V--"
<AJIsAwesome> Tekkit, I think.
<Shizuka> 13technic pack
<Shizuka> 13so about 50
<Kandarihu> It's a real testament to the complexity of this game when something like that is even a concern
<AJIsAwesome> What Shizu said.
<RDash5000> this music reminds me of twister.
<Shizuka> 13thaaaat would be because i've been playing the twister OST this whole time silly filly :3
<Dken2021> and the modders have used minecraft better than mojang together
<RDash5000> YAY
<RDash5000> I WAS RIGHT :d
<ThePillowship> When I finally buy MC, I don't know if I should keep it vanilla or play with mods
<Lunar_Brony> no, you said it REMINDED you of it
<Lunar_Brony> didn't say it was
<Meanwhile> Back in my day we made houses out of dirt. And we were happy!
<ThePillowship> Meanwhile, back in my day we made houses out of SOD
<RDash5000> god i love twister
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile when was your day, Indev?
<Dken2021> ThePillowship if this is like your fist time using minecraft, probably should try vanilla until you feel comfortable to try some mods
<Meanwhile> Lunar_Brony: Idk, like, 6 months ago.
<PeachStreak> AJIsAwesome: what colour should the mane be green,purple, and pink or what....?
<Randomnerd> Ugh... blanket time.
<ThePillowship> Dken2021, well i do have Minecraft but I got it by other means so Ihave no choice but to play vanilla
<Randomnerd> I'm sore and chilly.
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: Probably Green. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> ahahaha, i google the point of eccentricity and among common searches is "point of view", thats the internet in a nutshell right there
<RustyMeat> WHats this song called?
<RDash5000> Randomnerd: blanket time is best time
<ThePillowship> And why am I still ThePillowship?
<ThePillowship> I thought this was gonna be a temporary thing
<Meanwhile> Because you're slow?
<Shizuka> 13little miner is just now coming back
<PeachStreak> AJIsAwesome: I mean scene hair is usually multi coloured
<Dken2021> oh right, you were PillowPoni right?
<Randomnerd> I guess I should be lucky that I ccan do something about being cold and chilly.
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: What pony is this?
<ThePillowship> Dken2021, yes.
<PeachStreak> my scene one
<ThePillowship> Meanwhile, nope. The slow moments appear when jokes are being told and explained to me like I'm five.
<Airpuff> Been a while since i lastly was in this room :O
<AJIsAwesome> HOld on.
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile then you were running 1.2.5. Back then, I had a house made out of Obsidian and full gold armour.

<cachi01> http://i.qkme.me/353iex.jpg
<J_E_Smith71> I'd suggest using the banner timer that EqD uses, but it has a Season 3 background, so the timer itself is a spoiler
<BlueFlare> 06O_o
<cachi01> Bronysith: yes there is http://i.qkme.me/353iex.jpg
*Kurra wishes that people wouldn't be adversarial against other people who they otherwise care about and like :s

<Kandarihu> Saturn, what makes you think Romney does?
<Saturn> 08,01some of the stuff romney wants to do is just... scary
<ThePillowship> Better make some popcorn.
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rgiqg#by=ad
<Prodigy_X> I was on EQD and I was reading some fan fics and...... IT WAS SO GOOD!
<scout19_tf2> Saturn: eeeeeeyup the only goverment dude i like is john hoven
<DerpyMuffins> You are talking from personal feelings Saturn
<Cades> nope, I would live in a jar and then have someone bury me somewhere where nobody could find me, so I could live as spam for the rest of eternity
<cachi01> Bronysith: done that like 1000 times lol
<MahBoi777> congrats Prodigy_X!
<DerpyMuffins> They cloud your judgement
<Kurra> I wish I could vote for George McGovern as president honestly
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: he wants to amend your constitution so that gay people will never have the right to marry
<String_Shredder> Saturn: He's got binders full of women
<Wrek> 05rmoney isu a mormon
<Wrek> 05case closed
<Prodigy_X> I know
<Cades> so ha, get sum
<Airpuff> Saturn Yeah.. gays are like a parasite they will invade the world and color it pink!!!! -.- Which is why we must limit these extraordinary, "corrupt" people!!
<Airpuff> xD
<cachi01> twilight sprkle for world president 2012

<Meanwhile> Isn't politics not allowed in chat or something?
<Meanwhile> Please?
<scout19_tf2> Saturn: beside him yea they all suck
<Saturn> 08,01and he wants to make hate crimes against gay people okay to do
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rfy0u#by=ad
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: they have the right to a civil union, they do not have the right to infringe on others' religious freedom to not consider it marriage by the church's rules
<Prodigy_X> :O
<Bronysith> Saturn: wait who?
<Kurra> politics should be allowed, and adversarial viciousness excluded.
<Bronysith> Saturn: who is this?
<sonicdude558> o hai guise
<sonicdude558> sumi streaming?
<MahBoi777> heya sonicdude558
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> Shizuka.

<ThePillowship> Hey sonicdude558.
<Kurra> O_O
<therainbowvortex> Airpuff: thats just homo phobic god love and tolerate
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: i think he wants to bar civil union too, but i'm not sure
<scout19_tf2> hey sonicdude558
<Kandarihu> Kurra, agreed.

<String_Shredder> Saturn: I don't think he'll be elected. 47% of Americans depend on Obama's plans plus the percentage who supports Obama without all the help. that's more than half of the country.

<Saturn> 08,01"Mitt Romney opposes sexual orientation and transgender-inclusive hate crimes laws. According to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force he vetoed a bill funding hate crimes prevention in 2003." [http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbianactivism/p/MittRomney.htm]

*MahBoi777 hugs twilight_sprinkle "hai!"
<Cypresswolf> I think all politicians are aliens :P
<Meanwhile> Bronysith you were here already.
<Cades> i wonder...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02cachi01: ;3;
<Kandarihu> Saturn, that sounds like a rather slanted source there.
*twilight_sprinkle counter-hugs MahBoi777 :3
<scout19_tf2> that is one big hole
<Kurra> It is not idiocy Bronysith, unless we let ourselves fight
