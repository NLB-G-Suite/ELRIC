<VenHur> WHY CAN'T THIS GAME BE REAL, DAMN IT?! [whyuno face]
<ValtheJean> 2,14 except they aren't utterly drivel, you're just viewing it through tinted glasses
<Snow> SafariMonkey: appologies accepted
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and 20 years from now FiM will be seen the same way
<encephalomyocarditis> yes i got a perfect!!!
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,023.5 is like using Windows ME and saying people don't appreciate it because it's Windows.
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: wait... so the no mouth movement, telepathic ponies weren't utter drivel?
<BronyinJapan> So true^
<cachi01> 3.5 is bad.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's not 3.5
<cachi01> the end
<Dashie_Dashie> Oh god
<ValtheJean> 2,14 3.5 is twinkle wish adventure
<Dashie_Dashie> remmy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you're thinking of 3.6
<BronyinJapan> Love this video.
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: oh, I'm fine with 3.5
<Lunacorn> lol i saw almost all of season 1 in one night
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,02LOVE AND TOLERATE
<Dashie_Dashie> remmy gilard is amazing.
<cowvarkian> NewSuperBronyU|AFK: bugger off
<otakon> ValtheJean: eh maybe but it's so saccharine sweet it's just too damn much. There is no character, no conflict no ENGAGEMENT. G4 has those things at least even if it IS meant for kids primarily. It's like how jiggling keys entertain a baby and reading a good book.
<PeachStreak|yay> PeachStreak does approve slightly
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,02cowvarkian: :<
<Lunacorn> second day being brony and ive already learned alot...mabye too much
<cowvarkian> NewSuperBronyU|AFK: sorry

<otakon> Lunacorn: yeah welcome, stay away from R34
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,02;~; okies, I'll leave
<cowvarkian> NewSuperBronyU|AFK: ._.
<encephalomyocarditis> filly cherilee
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU|AFK: NO DON'T!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 otakon: you saying that means you haven't actually WATCHED any of it, or refused to actually pay attention
<VenHur> ...Windows ME was the very first Windows I used...
<VenHur> ...Sue me.
<cachi01> Lunacorn: dont listen to otakon! r34 is awesome!
<Lunacorn> otakon: yeah i just wish i could forget about the cloppers and whatnot
<SafariMonkey> Lunacorn: You became a brony and were immediately subjected to tha
<Cypresswolf> Lunacorn: beware - not all the links posted are sane one >_>
<SafariMonkey> t?
<otakon> ValtheJean: I have watched it, remember we streamed that damn Twinkle Star movie like three times now. It had no conflict and it was insipid.
<SafariMonkey> Lunacorn: My condolances.
<cowvarkian> cachi01: ikr
<otakon> ValtheJean: now G1 on the other hand was more enjoyable
<ValtheJean> 2,14 then the latter applies
<cachi01> im ok with g1, i dont like it i dont hate it
<Lunacorn> yeah when i became brony i was like ohai! and all the sudden omg derpy clopping r34 colgate toothpaste celestia bananas
<ValtheJean> 2,14 your refusal to see things doesn't bother me, there's just not much else to talk about

<sonicdude558> dang it Dashie_Dashie you stole wat I was gonna say
<Kencolt> Lawliet: Spanish, specifically Castellano. That kind of confused someone from last night who was only familiar with Latino.
<sonicdude558> beep boop
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> hi everypony what are we watching
<LordDerpington> Yeah, this is Spanish Spanish, not any of the South American dialects.

<MadSurge> SCREW THE WOMAN I GOT MY BABBI
<Kammerjunk> 42
<PONY> how come this was the A-movie?
<SirGanjalf> He just wants Mini Me.
<Lil_B> Snow what?= I heard Steam?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> anyone stoked for AC3?
<cuddly_kittehs> the answer to life, the universe, and everything; 42
<LordDerpington> Because it's highly critically acclaimed.
<PONY> ^
<cuddly_kittehs> Lil_B: People getting my steam name :P
<CriticKitten> PONY: 'cuz this movie is *brilliant*
<Lil_B> ohey PONY long time no see
<SirGanjalf> He's like dr Evil, but... evil.
<PONY> O hai
<LochNessCheez> I hope this movie lasts longer
<cachi01> PONY: cause its an awesome movie
<cachi01> thats why
<cuddly_kittehs> Dr. insano is best.....EHHHH?
<RAWRity> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcgd62wBzM1r2jf9ro1_500.jpg
<DerpyMuffins> This movie deserves an award or something
<MadSurge> Creepy ass monsters, and the scariest thing in the movie is this guy
<SirGanjalf> DerpyMuffins: I think it did received plenty.
<Lil_B> cuddly_kittehs Dr. Insano :) somebody likes Spoony
<Snow> RAWRity: you just did not make a yo momma joke
<PONY> I know Pan is good, but for some reason I find it's status as A-movie highly questionable... Partly because it's Spanish.
<cuddly_kittehs> Lil_B: /)
<cachi01> RAWRity: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
<Lil_B> cuddly_kittehs (\
<cuddly_kittehs> cachi01: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEEEIII
<MadSurge> PONY: deliberatedly.
<LordDerpington> Language is no barrier to a movie's quality. We've had foreign A-movies here before.
<SirGanjalf> ^
<RAWRity> PONY: that is incredibly stupid
<cachi01> isnt guillermo del toro mexican?
<PONY> RAWRity, was not the main reason.
<SirGanjalf> Nah, i think he's spanish
<J_E_Smith71> PONY: I think it's because this had a US release. I think forgein movie with no US release is an auto B I think
<alexxm> he knows
<PONY> §
<cachi01> YE GUILLERMO DEL TORO IS MEXICAN =D
<Flyboy> DUN DUN DUUUUN
<cachi01> AND HE IS FROM MY CITY =D
<PONY> okay, J_E_Smith71 makes sense.
<SirGanjalf> I wonder if he's still planing to make that Lovecraft-based movie...
<Kammerjunk> I'd watch that.
<Snow> inb4 gets shot, again, its a guess
<cuddly_kittehs> crap, L4D2 is taking FOREVER to dowload. Saints row was at like, 2% by now!
<SirGanjalf> oh, my bad then
<Kammerjunk> Or maybe I wouldn't. I'd probably go mad watching it.
<Kotano> SirGanjalf I think it was scrapped,because Universal didn't have a lot of financial success lately
<LochNessCheez> lol
<cuddly_kittehs> Or my screen is doing that glitch where i dont see the progress bar
<BladedWings> and this is where i came in last night ^_^
<PONY> The international releases as a barrier, makes a lot of sense.
<SirGanjalf> Kotano: Maybe *sniff*, maybe...
<Flyboy> TAKA ME WID YOU!
<LochNessCheez> 'oh I can't take you' 5 seconds later *takes with her*
<Kammerjunk> Flyboy: You are gud jump?
<Snow> Flyboy: that yogscast reffrence :D
<turtlegod98> gello
<Flyboy> eeyup
<DerpyMuffins> This is when things get really fucked up
<turtlegod98> *hello
<MadSurge> Oshit
<Kammerjunk> turtlegod98: Gi.
<SirGanjalf> Kotano: Besides, i've heard they wanted it to be a PG-13 movie...
<cachi01> funfact: my little brothers best friends aunt is guillermo del toro :I
<JT> captain is bitching this shit
<yifle1> hello everypony

<Metronome> PWNED
<LochNessCheez> badass
<Kotano> SirGanjalf : I haven't read the story that the movie's based on yet,but PG-13 for a Lovecraft-movie sounds like a disaster just waiting to happen.
<JT> go for the kill bitch!
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Daaayum

<Snow> they really need some snipers
<DerpyMuffins> Sniping pro
<LochNessCheez> that guy lied
<turtlegod98> every horse is a pony by law.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> finally my internet got fix apparently
<Domo> creepy voice is a go
<Squallken> love that shot
<Iwa> Well, that explains who the baby was in the wall painting.
<NxPaqu> Technically, satyrs are half goats, fauns are half deers.
<PONY> It's the true King of Spain (11th Century)
<Kammerjunk> Oh, so -that's- why it's called Pan's Labyrinth.
<JT> joker style

<Bogy> okay..
<kirzstryfe> now he just needs to get the other side done to match
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He's half Jack Nicholson now.
<Dark_Horst> why not ask the paramedic?
<Kammerjunk> Hire this guy for the next Batman film.
<Kandarihu> He's a demi-Joker, now
<Metronome> Wait, Is That CG?
<PONY> You got a free mouth extension, Y U STITCH?
<Eli> it's not that funny. but luckily we're only half joker... ahh joking
<LochNessCheez> I would have expected him to cut the other side to make it symmetrical
<turtlegod98> guy has some balls.
<Snow> ping me when its over
<DerpyMuffins> Its Scarface
<Kammerjunk> Eli: Do ho ho.
<Kammerjunk> Snow: Will do.
<PONY> Now we know who the Joker really is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good.
<Lil_B> hi Eli :)
<Eli> hi Lil_B
<Kandarihu> You know, he should see a doctor about this... except that he KILLED THE ONLY ONE!
<turtlegod98> snow
<RAWRity> the next 10 minutes is just watching him slowly put in the stitches
<Kammerjunk> Besides, this is a much better way than falling into a bunch of chemicals.
<PONY> dat will bburn
<Blaze> 14I just joined yesterday.

<Snow> ah thank god
<LochNessCheez> ooh
<PONY> it took like 3 secs
<Kandarihu> Snow, the movie isn't over, just the scene of Vidal stitching his lip together.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's today.
<Kammerjunk> Snow: Oh, I thought you meant the entire film.
<Kandarihu> And to be honest, that wasn't even all that graphic.
<Lil_B> he better only speak with the right side of his mauth now... like Silvester Stallone
<Iwa> Didn't that guy get shot about 3 times? :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> :O
<PONY> shoot
<LochNessCheez> nope
<LochNessCheez> 5
<Eli> Lil_B: :|
<LordDerpington> It seems longer, the first time you see it. I think because it's so unexpectedly graphic.
<LochNessCheez> we're leaving together!
<JT> Iaw this guy has 4 wounds ^^
<LochNessCheez> it's like armageddon
<PONY> Iwa, inB4 jokes about Spanish immortality/bad armory

<Iwa> twilight_sprinkle: Isn't it the power of psychotism?
<alexxm> how are things Michael
<Domo> Hi Michael
<PONY> now you are thinking with portals

<Zephyr> aww she got Ketchup on her fin...wait
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I would think so
<PONY> that time of
<turtlegod98> shot LIKE A BOSS
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah flutterchu good thing you missed this movie, its pretty nasty
<Lil_B> is she no innocent?
<LochNessCheez> why does it stop at the exciting parts D:
<NxPaqu> Drop of blood~
<Snow> he suddenly realizes
<MadSurge> Aaaand he's screwed
<cachi01> innocent blood
<Snow> or not
<LordDerpington> Yeah, this is a pretty intense movie, flutterchu . A really worthwhile watch, but not an easy one.
<DerpyMuffins> You screwed bro
<PONY> you ded
<Flyboy> in this film, these is no pain ;|
<Kammerjunk> Pain is for the weak.
<Blaze> 14Hey.
<LochNessCheez> wtf
<LochNessCheez> I don't get it
<twilight_sprinkle> still dont agree that shes innocent..
<Snow> I AINT GOT TIME TO FEEL PAIN
<Chrysalis> No Pain no Gain
<LordDerpington> He knows he's outnumbered and done for, LochNessCheez
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: why?
<SirGanjalf> inb4 STFU
<cachi01> i cant get why u dont think she is innocent
<CriticKitten> NICE
<PONY> cheek shot
<Michael> what a tweeest
<turtlegod98> i've always wanted a gold pocket watch... ;_;
<MadSurge> OWNED
<Snow> PWND
<cachi01> DAYUM
<Eli> sweeet
<JT> precision shot? :O
<LochNessCheez> what was awesome
<Domo> WOOOO
<turtlegod98> lol
<Kammerjunk> I half expected him to just say "Ow, what'd you do that for?"
<Flyboy> like a baws
<Kimori> oh alrighty
<Snow> what fun is there in making sence?
<MadSurge> She still ded :'(
<Kimori> nice to meet you too :)
<Kammerjunk> Drip.
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: because she seemed to have been partially driven by her personal desire to get away from the world, and she disreegareded what might happen to her mother when doing that mandrake stuff
<PONY> dem portals
<JT> @snow, discord much?XD
<Iwa> Blood of the innocent...BAM
<turtlegod98> Is It can bees hugs tiem now plz?
<Kandarihu> So for the record, Mercedes and the baby lived.
<LochNessCheez> it's obvious what's going to happen
<PONY> Science time
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: um, the mandrake stuff was to KEEP HER MOTHER ALIVE
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: themandrake was going to save her mother...
<turtlegod98> what film is this?
<Snow> inb4 nether portal
<PONY> Pans labyrint
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: yeah, if you choose to believe a random creepy faun thing yo dont know
<CriticKitten> Dat song. ;_;
<Blaze> 14C:
<MadSurge> Blood of the innocent
<LochNessCheez> she ain't innocent
<turtlegod98> I have a theory.
<PONY> She made Sacrifice
<Michael> magic
<flutterchu> Tennis Ball from BFGI: ........O_O........are.....you....SERIOUS......DX
<Snow> MadSurge: well, not my blood then, ive seen some shit i regret
<PONY> She innocent again
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: then by that logic we can say that he was lying about the blood of an innocent.
<DerpyMuffins> She was resonsible for atleast 2 deaths
<JT> princess of the underworld? :S
<Kammerjunk> She the man now, dog.
<PONY> DerpyMuffins: and sacrifice
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: We can see that, but She couldnt have known
<CriticKitten> See?
<LochNessCheez> wat
<LochNessCheez> loyalty
<Kammerjunk> And then she woke up.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: so your entire argument for why she shouldn't meet the Faun's rules is that the Faun could be a liar.
<LochNessCheez> ^
<NxPaqu> Faun was good all along
<CriticKitten> So the blood of the innocent thing was a lie too. :P
<PONY> dat hell
<DerpyMuffins> She died and gone to heaven
<Michael> sacrfice yourselve, obtain royalty
<JT> the underworld is pretty happy
<turtlegod98> That when 2012 happens all the bronies and pegasisters on earth get saved by celestia and transported to equestria as ponies. Would that be awesome?
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, no.
<LochNessCheez> ikt
<Domo> So how is this the underworld?
<LochNessCheez> ikr*
<Metronome> At Least She Die Happy :):):)
<flutterchu> 2nd best pony: OH COME ON
<turtlegod98> would it?
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: and youre argument is that thats impossible? seems very much possible to me, i wouldt trust it, and most people wouldnt
<Michael> turtlegod98: make it happen
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Clearly was, they just SAID it was. :P
<JT> Turtlegod, if that happens will we roommates? :D
<Flyboy> turtlegod98: all you must do is beleive my freind, its what i try and do
<alexxm> Domo perhaps it's some genric spainish word for afterlife
<Iwa> JT: The underworld is commonly seen as bad, but in several mythologies the underworld shares pure bliss with rooms off ultimate despair :3
<PONY> turtlegod98, for science!
<Buytoast> Well I guess she's reached the end of her life's PAN!
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: no, she went out with a smile and the world got a greedy general :(
<Kammerjunk> turtlegod98: Probably not. I haven't gone a day without modern technology for the last 10 years.
<Kencolt> turtlegod98: I dunno. I like having fingers.
<LochNessCheez> 'for many centuries' ?
<LochNessCheez> what about after that?
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, she was also innocent. She substituted the baby's blood for her own.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: no, my argument is that if we assume the Faun is lying about the mandrake, he could also be lying about needing to be the blood of the innocent.
<turtlegod98> i'll try do it for my friendchips
<Flyboy> turtlegod98: in my mind, i know it cant be true. in my heart, i beleive it is
<MadSurge> :'(
<NxPaqu> Honestly, although freaky as hell, this was a very good movie.
<JT> 1+ flyboy
<DerpyMuffins> 9.5/10
<DerpyMuffins> It was good
<Kammerjunk> Great! I can't wait to watch that end-of-the-world film with the name and the people.
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Her innocence was irrelevant. They said it was her willingness to give her own blood rather than another's.
<flutterchu> um..........
<Squallken> it was okay
<flutterchu> whuh
<Kandarihu> Total Recall Ending /10
<NxPaqu> 8.5/10
<Bogy> wasn't bad.. 9.5/10 :)
<LochNessCheez> That creepy pedo guy with the feast was creepy
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: yes,, he couldve been? we found out affter she died, but he couldve easily been lying
<Stormman3100> This movie made me cry, very hard to do. 10/10
<Rosfox> 9/10
<AJIsAwesome> 8.5/10
<alexxm> i liked
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0110/10.
<LordDerpington> Superb. Once seen, never forgotten.
<Lil_B> I'd give it a 10/10 I see no point in where this Movie wqas bad
<Snow> this film reminds me i made the right choise
<JT> 7/10
<Kothen> 10/10
<Flyboy> ponies/10
<LochNessCheez> 10/10
<cuddly_kittehs> 8/10
<LochNessCheez> I say
<Michael> yay spanish movie :)
<NxPaqu> Actually, 9/10
<Eli> 8/10
<DerpyMuffins> This movie really is good
<CriticKitten> And this movie is really, really good. Honestly, tis one of my favorites.
<somepony_else> 10 / 10
<Kammerjunk> I didn't watch half the film, so I can't give it a proper rating/10
<PONY> I still don't see anything special in this film, it's graphical, and forcefully touching... Same as before, I give it 6/10
<twilight_sprinkle> so what was the point of that creepy child-eating guy, just for some bonus trippiness or what?
<LochNessCheez> that captain was a badass
<MadSurge> RAWRity: he just didn't specify what qualified as "blood of the innocent"
<Colt_Brovakiin> 10/10 creepy as shit...
<Snow> that i would rather die to save a friend.
<twilight_sprinkle> what PONY said
<JT> I thought it was good, evendo I didn't really understand everything
<cuddly_kittehs> erm
<cuddly_kittehs> The child-eater?
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: how is it you continually make arguments that are so full of holes and double-think that even Big Brother would balk?
<PONY> Thank you twilight_sprinkle, finally somepony agrees.
<cuddly_kittehs> I would explain it, but that would be a paragraph
<LochNessCheez> child eater was creepy
<cuddly_kittehs> T_T
<ValtheJean> 2,14 calm yourself RAWRity
<Michael> LochNessCheez: IKR?
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: and how is it that you can never come up with a counter-argument
<DerpyMuffins> Calmate senor
<ValtheJean> 2,14 everyone can have an opinion, even if it's poor. Let's not start flame wars
<Flyboy> spanish movies/10
<Eli> and now we switch from an 8/10 movie to a 8/10 pony episode to a 3/10 movie
<Squallken> i just the major turn off for me was a critic say this was as good as LotR's, which made me sick. because its the wronest sentance commited to the printed word :[
<CriticKitten> I can understand your rating, PONY, I just don't agree. It's honestly a very good movie. Tells its story well.
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: kinda, but probably to make you realize that even a monster like that was childplay next to the psycho captain
*Snow grabs an extuinghuiser
*Michael throws water to flame wars
<Snow> im ready for the flame war
<LochNessCheez> I thought that those were some of the most epic movie moments
<Kammerjunk> Well, 2012 was rated what, 5.5/10? I dunno, it was rated too high.
<DerpyMuffins> This was a good movie, ahead of its time
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: you always run ot of things to say and just answer "well youre dumb and your opinion is dumb, im so smart"
<JT> 2012 is 8/10 atleast thats my opinion
<CriticKitten> But I can understand why it wouldn't appeal to some people.
<PONY> Also, I had to sleep on a couch after I watched this with my Ex, she didn't like my "meh" reaction.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Going to +m if a flame war starts.
<JT> it was a bit farfetcht but eh, it wasn't bad
<Flyboy> 2012, isnt that bad in my opinion. atleast it has slight fact behind it. but then again. opinions.
<Squallken> brb
<LochNessCheez> I enjoyed the movie.
<PONY> but opinions, opinions. That's all there is.
<cuddly_kittehs> 2012 isnt bad
<Eli> Squallken: don't take critics seriously, it'sa all a matter of opinions
<cuddly_kittehs> its just boring
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: because when I, or anyone else presents a deconstruction of your argument, you immediately deny it as us just being assholes.
<PONY> it's still art.
<cuddly_kittehs> REALLY BORING
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just for that behavior, I'm skipping the credits :P no pretty music for you
<DerpyMuffins> Here comes the +m
<Snow> Nittany_Discord: +m?
<Kammerjunk> ^
<BroPony|MEDIC> hi everypony
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: hm well thats iterestingactually
<LochNessCheez> NOOO
<Michael> yay do it
<CriticKitten> Squallken: Depends on what they meant. It's not really a fantasy movie in the same vein as LOTR so I'd really not bother comparing them against each other.
<NullRadix> I remember seeing a review for 2012 that had to point out: Now imagine if this was directed by Michael Bay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Snow: it's a chat channel mode.
<Lil_B> ValtheJean I'll make my own pretty music !
<Michael> hai BroPony|MEDIC
<LochNessCheez> lol I saw your desktop for a sec
<Applejack2012> hi
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: lol, please show me where i said that before you said my opinion is dumb
<JT> bridly gossip FTW
<Bogy> or not
<Squallken> kk
<LordDerpington> Zombie ponies!
<JT> one of the best episodes
<cuddly_kittehs> All hiding from the child eater
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: or after that, for that matter
<Rainbow_Glasses> Suddenly ponies.
<cuddly_kittehs> T_T
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Prevents everyone but people with +, %, or @ from talking.
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: so many children were scarred by this "fantasy" movie
<Flyboy> bridle gossip?
<Lil_B> ok, I'm out during this epü, see you in 2012 :D
<Michael> the throtting dead
<Snow> ah ok
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: please provide the quote of me calling you an asshole, i beg of you
<Bogy> pony zombies! :o
<BoulderDash> very possible
<alexxm> zombies should be canon
<ValtheJean> 2,14 stopit
<ValtheJean> 2,14 stop it now
<ValtheJean> 2,14 drop it or I'm banning
<Kammerjunk> +m - Huddle in regulars
<cuddly_kittehs> ValtheJean: talk to the to people who are fighting <_<
<CriticKitten> Squallken: But I'd say it's a movie that is as good at what it was trying to do as LOTR did at what it was trying to do. They both have different roles and different stories, and they both do it very well.
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<DerpyMuffins> Here comes the ban
<Michael> evil
<HavokOC> Who's getting ban?
<LochNessCheez> ValtheJean Did I see the rainbow dash colour scheme on your desktop?

<Michael> incoming meme
<Rainbow_Glasses> :0
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and it's still in the chat
<Kammerjunk> Eli: Just find a French Flutterguy version of Evil Enchantress some time. It sounds delicious.
<Snow> Shes an evil enchantress she does evil dances, when you look into her eyes she puts you in trances. and what will she do, she will cook up an evil brew and gobble you up in a big tasty stew. soooo, WATCH OUT!
<HavokOC> cuddly_kittehs, Maybe we can play together sometimes when it's done? xD
<Domo> Oh my gosh, LIFE IS THERE!
<Applejack2012> lol Flutters shift role with AJ

<Dark_Horst> think about it. ponies have absolute control over their environment. an ecosystem that sustains itself must scare the crap outta them
<Kammerjunk> Crainy: About 2 hours ago.
<cuddly_kittehs> HavokOC: :P its funny to watch, since i turn so hilirausly slow
<HavokOC> Crainy, It's going on now :D

<Kammerjunk> I don't speak your crazy Moon language, Zecora!
<HavokOC> MALEH
<J_E_Smith71> With the CMC they didn't use their normal stock art. Instead they used a fan art image of them with their cutie marks.
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: while the other networks are content to blame the assassination of our ambassador and three other delegates on an internet video no one ever heard of
<CrimsonPhoenix> Fluttershy's voice is so outstanding it's amazing
<turtlegod98> what drink does discord drink?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: wat
<LordDerpington> J_E_Smith71: That's a piece of fanart by GlamourKat, who started as a fan and is now employed on the show as a layout artist.
<Shizuka> 13but fox is obviously the worst
<Crainy> NAO
<SirGanjalf> turtlegod98: Chocolate milk of glass

<Michael> ^^^^
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, how so?
<Alchemist> you made me sound smexy
<Kammerjunk> Flutterguy is so incredibly sexy.
<J_E_Smith71> LordDerpington: I know it was made by someone who works on the show now. Just seems strange they'd use an old fan image she did with non-canon cutie marks on offical media.
<Kammerjunk> ...The voice, I mean.
<LochNessCheez> lol with rainbow dash still having that thing on her nose
<Crainy> Zecora is secretly Michael Bay
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Mer? I can point to instances of every media outlet doing stupid things. If we're gonna trade one to one, we'll be here all day. That's why I said "they're all stupid".

<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: curse yoooo!
<CriticKitten> Shizu: That we agree on. I don't even watch news any more. The media's pathetic nowadays. >_>
<MadSurge> Shizuka: then stay away from Italy please
<Kandarihu> Everypony remember Flutterguy's voice and listen for it in the B Movie.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Kvetching?
<Michael> seems legit
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Curses shmurches.
<Rainbow_Glasses> Pinkie's face
<JT> I see what you did there twilight XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: you cant just stand there and tell me this isnt a curse
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: There is no such thing as a curse. Unless you're a necromancer, in which case you'll rely heavily on them.

<GabeMoist> the kind of year of which I've dreamed since I was small
<RustyMeat> Wait did I miss pans laberyth?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,012012 has sucked so far TBH.
<Shizuka> 13soulrider95: no but you should vote for The Core also
<Sonny> common guys who sended me that commission :o??
<FlaschenJoe11> I haven't seen this one yet. So I will watch it fully.

<DerpyMuffins> So Indians discovered the end of the world?
<LochNessCheez> at least it's not "The core"

<XylemTube> STRANGE ISINT IT
<kirzstryfe> ^_^
<LochNessCheez> Shizuka: but the black guy dies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The Core and 2012 are about the same in my opinion.
<FlaschenJoe11> Shizuka: sorry, I won't give up until The Transformers: The Movie is the A choice
<Shizuka> 13oh also i passed val my better subs so no rigging the monastery today
<Dark_Horst> actually, i think the core made more sense at times than 2012
<Sonny> damnit now I'll never find out :/
<Slen> I don't remember this part of the movie.
<LunAnonymous> SPOILER ALERT: DISASTERS COMING UP
<Dark_Horst> less plotholes filled with bullshit
<Sumica> 00,10nonsence Shizuka this movie has so many more silly locations
<PONY> Kandarihu, I am aware... i have been coming to this site for a year and I only come here Saturdays, for I am an euroBrony
<LochNessCheez> Shizuka: WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE BLACK GUY
<Sumica> 00,10and president obama
<Shizuka> 13yeah but in The Core the Colosseum gets blown up by lightning
<LochNessCheez> meh
<Dark_Horst> and angela merkel
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh, yeah Shizuka.
<Kencolt> OK-- subtitle everything BUT tha part that's NOT in english.
<Kandarihu> PONY, my apologies, then.
<CriticKitten> A copper mine? Pft screw that, I mine orichalcum these days, I'm Lvl 80 bish. :| *self-5 for GW2 ref*
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: in 2012 neutrinos mutate
<Slen> My headphones keep clicking.
<Shizuka> 13Kencolt: these subs i assume are partially taken from whatever the official subs are
<pony_2458> 2012 6_9
<Shizuka> 13evidently that short dialogue isn't plot relevant >>
<PONY> Kandarihu, you forgot meh :'(
<SafariMonkey> The neutrinos are mutating! They're heating up the earth!
<GabeMoist> NOT THE NEUTRINOS
<RAWRity> "The neutrinos are causing a physical reaction"
<Michael> we're dooomed
<Shizuka> 13that IS impossible, but if you can accept that premise, the rest of the movie follows
<Blaze> 14I've got nothing to do this weekend. ouo
<RAWRity> I know virtually nothing about pphysics but I suspect that's bullshit.
<Sumica> 00,10ok fine next time you write and sync the subs and see how good you make them
<LochNessCheez> 'mutated'
*Shizuka 13hugs sumica~
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Microwaves can heat rock?
<LordDerpington> I can forgive janky science if the rest of the movie makes up for it. I enjoyed Sunshine, even if the "restart the sun with a nuclear bomb" plot is ridiculous.
<CriticKitten> Microwaves are magical
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: they had an antonov flying a rollercoaster pattern
<Cades> hey
<Michael> yay for science
<Maid_RainBow> whats this movie i know it
<Dark_Horst> planes of that size do not move like that
<LunAnonymous> 2013
<Shizuka> 13Dark_Horst: but The Core has a Sailor Moon reference
<Kjakings> 7Peasant
<Dark_Horst> ithas?
<Dark_Horst> never noticed
<Shizuka> 13yup
<CriticKitten> 1.7 million dollars. Wow, that's a lot of money. Except not really that much for a senator or high-level staff.
<Shizuka> 13it also has harvey dent
<Shizuka> 13check and mate :3
<Cades> lol
<CriticKitten> ....it has Harvey Dent?
<Alchemist> Wow, there will be a diana Krall concert at budapest in november. I might even go if I have the money.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He plays the snooty scientist, right?
<Blaze> 14whut
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In The Core.
<CriticKitten> Yeah sorry, I think it does win, then.
<Shizuka> 13no no he's the main
<DerpyMuffins> This Sentor looks like an ass
<Dark_Horst> wait, we were talking about what movie was better or which one made less sense?
<Dark_Horst> i forgot
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh OK.
<Maid_RainBow> whats this movie called agian?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Need to watch that again.
<Shizuka> 13i forget what else zimsky's actor was in
<LordDerpington> 2012, Maid_RainBow
<Michael> Maid_RainBow: 2012
<Blaze> 14I have a song stuck in my head. :B
<Shizuka> 13the black guy did one of the dogs in Up
<kidzrul434> I'm hungry, let's go get mcdonalds! :)
<SafariMonkey> Nittany_Discord:Some microwaves are approximately at the resonant frequency of water, so they interact most with water. If this is the same but for commom rock crystals, the same could happen.
<TheSubpixel> It's a trap!
<LordDerpington> Also there are hydrous minerals.
<Slen> Shizuka: I thought the other guy was the main character.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Neutrinos can only morph into other neutrinos.
<SafariMonkey> True LordDerpington
<Shizuka> 13aaron eckhart and hilary swank are the leads for The Core, or at least they survive to the end
<Michael> revolution!
<CriticKitten> Hey look, it's Detriot
<TheSubpixel> NO G8
<CriticKitten> Oh, wait, it's not?
<twilight_sprinkle> no pony G8?
<Slen> 2010.
<SafariMonkey> Nittany_Discord neutrinos are as similar as 3s, they are identical
<Shizuka> 13NO D8, ONLY D20
<DerpyMuffins> Wtf is G8?
<LochNessCheez> generation 8 xD
<Saturn> 08,01i remember when The Core came out
<Lil_B> thats accurate toi the last G8 meeting I remember
<Kimori> What song?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think I watched The Core in theaters.
<CriticKitten> d20 is best d. d10 is close second.
<Saturn> 08,01me and my brother wanted to go to the cinema; he wanted to see The Core, i wanted to see Hercules
<Caramel> 2,14 D8's are for Clerics!
<Saturn> 08,01we couldn't agree, so we just went separately
<LordDerpington> I think you made the right choice.
<Saturn> 08,01fuckin' splitter.
<DerpyMuffins> Hercules had so many facts wrong
<Shizuka> 13also he said it wrong, it should be misters president
<Kandarihu> DerpyMuffins, an annual conference of the 8 most economically powerful nations in the world.
<Shizuka> 13or messrs president, not sure how the plural of mister works
<DerpyMuffins> Obama looks stressed
<Lil_B> oh, the woman is Germany? I'm ok with it, she's prettier than our reall Concellor xD
<Marty> G8 sucks.
<Michael> it's the end of the world, as we know it ~
<FlaschenJoe11> Lil_B: True that
<Sumica> 00,10this damn project is good for us
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd make a political joke here, but I can't.
<Sumica> 00,10we can have dam tours with dam pictures
<PONY> Chinese Democracy
<Sonny> I'm hacing the feeling this movie is called 2012
<Shizuka> 13sumica has big dam plans :3
<Sonny> spoil spoil
<Shizuka> 13he's reading twilight
<LordDerpington> It's in monies.
<alexxm> one billion monies
<LunAnonymous> "Reading is for eggheads"
<Michael> yay for €
<JT> in euros? :O
<SafariMonkey> If G8 were gen 8, extrapolation of gens 1-4 on a polynomial would lead to the conclusion that it would probably be AWESOME!
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Lisa

<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Yes it does. Otherwise you couldn't function. People are dying every second. Someone just died in the same span of time I typed this sentence. And that's awful, absolutely. But any normal person doesn't break down when people die.

<EEVERSTI> weeeeeeeee
<smrtgy1> JT: No, they're just sleeping.... underwater....
<Kencolt> We can't start the engine until we close that gate. This might be a design flaw.
<Serenity> smrtgy1: With the fishies
<CriticKitten> DerpyMuffins: This movie violates all semblance of logic and you're going to poke at THAT little inconsistency? :P
<JT> smrtgy1, oh few I was worried about them
<HurricaneAkumin> Well, this movie certainly gets me in the mood for having nightmares. :P
<DerpyMuffins> CriticKitten yes
<SafariMonkey> Kencolt: Or it might be that starting the engine with the gate open is more dangerous
<LunAnonymous> this movie is surprisingly boring
<EEVERSTI> of course it has tob everest
<SafariMonkey> Oh it has to be everest doesn't it
<EEVERSTI> to be*
<CriticKitten> So why don't you have a goddamn override again?
<SirGanjalf> 29k ft?! It's almost 30k ft!
<Serenity> Fucking everest, ALWAYS in the way
<SafariMonkey> EEVERSTI: jinx
<alexxm|colt> what happened to the yetis
<HurricaneAkumin> Oh i get it, everyone in the world is on the plane, and if they take off in time, they all survive.
<Slen> If only people could live on mount everest... They would be safe.
<Michael> everest is best iceberg
<CubanAmericanBrony> I'm on the top of the world!!!
<SirGanjalf> alexxm|colt: They evolved into SeaYetis

<DerpyMuffins> I'd have a ticket for the Ark
<SafariMonkey> *labyrinth
<Iwa> SafariMonkey: Yes, definitely
<DerpyMuffins> Really Noah?
<Kothenion> SafariMonkey: Yes. It's worth checking out.
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Kencolt> SafariMonkey: I found it kind of... odd.
<HurricaneAkumin> Wait a minute. In this movie, does the world end by flooding? Because i thought the original theory is that the world blows up!
<DerpyMuffins> You're an attention hog arent you
<SafariMonkey> Thanks Iwa Kothenion and Kencolt
*BroPony|MEDIC bakes Derpy_Hooves and DerpyMuffins an apology muffin
<SafariMonkey> I'll check it out
<Trixieburgfan1337> thats a mighty big boat
<Kandarihu> That giraffe must be WIERDED THE HECK OUT right now.
<SirGanjalf> HurricaneAkumin: First it blows up, then comes the flood, then asteroid hits it.
<SafariMonkey> Can't believe I missed both movie nights
<smrtgy1> BroPony|MEDIC: You just baked DerpyMuffin's brother D:
<Trixieburgfan1337> SafariMonkey: youre not the only one :(
<flutterchu> B:|TCH THIS NEEDS AN HAPPY ENDING
<BroPony|MEDIC> NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<XylemTube> JUST LIKE HALO
<Kandarihu> Wait for iiiiit
<HurricaneAkumin> SirGanjalf: Talk about an inception style movie o_o
<SafariMonkey> Trixieburgfan1337: I feel for you. :(
<Serenity> flutterchu: The world ended and all the trolls died
<Serenity> Happy enough?
<Kandarihu> Wait for it....
<SirGanjalf> And after that, everything that's left is destroyed by gamma-ray burst.
<Trixieburgfan1337> s0 wait, the world is ending and a meteor just HAPPENS to be hitting the earth also?
<smrtgy1> What meteor?
<Trixieburgfan1337> when it rains it bucking pours huh?
<AJIsAwesome> Trixieburgfan1337: No meteor.
<smrtgy1> That sounds like Glados
<Kandarihu> Wait for iiit.......
<Lil_B> Serenity do you realkly think that nobody would at least save one of the 4chan servers?
<DerpyMuffins> She is giving it all shes got captin
<SafariMonkey> Trixieburgfan1337: What metor?
<Kandarihu> ...wait for it...
<Trixieburgfan1337> SafariMonkey: thats what i want to know

<HurricaneAkumin> Oh, i was wrong. I guess movies always do have happy endings after all.
<PONY> Dark92Enigma, mount everest
<d3rb> man they didnt even make the first service before damaging the arc
<SirGanjalf> BOOMER WILL LI-nope, he drowned, sorry.
<Dark92Enigma> PONY: My mistake :(
<SafariMonkey> So the moral is it's better to risk dying than to leave without some people?
<DerpyMuffins> The gas money it takes to fuel one of these "Arks"
<SafariMonkey> hmmm
<BroPony|MEDIC> SirGanjalf: Whose boomer?
<Trixieburgfan1337> daww he died
<Colt_Brovakiin> Shaddup Noah...

<smrtgy1> NO
<Dark92Enigma> WE're :'( acting
<SafariMonkey> CriticKitten: Ping!
<Iwa> JT: It's worse enough there's a Titanic 2 movie...
<Michael> never dies
<Sonny> nope
<smrtgy1> Why does he never stay dead!
<JT> Iwa ur kidding right?
<DerpyMuffins> The main character never dies
<SafariMonkey> Iwa: seriously?
<PONY> He caused it..... but HE DID IT!
<HurricaneAkumin> Time for a victory screech.
<Iwa> JT: I am not kidding
<Dark92Enigma> Michael: why?
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma but... but... THEY DID IT HE SURVIVED
<Sonny> I'd like you all to invite me to my party of fucks I give
<Serenity> Derpy_Hooves: Most of the time
<Sonny> :)
<DerpyMuffins> Tab fail again
<Lil_B> Asian Man approves
<Serenity> The main char died in Hitman
<Sonny> just kidding :p

<Michael> Dark92Enigma: on movies, as i heard, van damme never died on a movie
<Derpy_Hooves> ...
<HurricaneAkumin> Well, so much for me having nightmares tonight. ;)
<Kencolt> DerpyMuffins: Tell that to most of the characters in Pan's Labyrinth.
<JT> I've googled it...
<BroPony|MEDIC> SirGanjalf: I see

<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: oooh.....it would be funny if the same thing happens.....funny.......but horrible.....
<HurricaneAkumin> So now, everyone is living inside a ship? Cool.
<Dark92Enigma> Michael: Oh, i get it

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/23/0AUrTOo-pUGVR-NS6LU1pQ2.jpg
<CubanAmericanBrony> Worst than that there's two Titanic animated movies that absolutely terrible.
<SafariMonkey> Iwa: I just saw the IMDb -- if you can get 1 star on IMDb you're doing something very wrong
<JT> shipping on a ship? yes please
<AJIsAwesome> CubanAmericanBrony: Rapping dog..... <_<
<LordDerpington> Sexy times!
<AJIsAwesome> *-_-
<PaperHats> Ew

<HurricaneAkumin> Before 12/21 comes, i'll start living inside a boat. What a great idea!
<DerpyMuffins> Cock block inb4
<Iwa> SafariMonkey: Or focussing on doing something wrong :)
<Sonny> The FX is nice in this film but I'd wouldn't give it an ammy
<Slen> Month 1, Year 1, A.A. (After Anihilation)
<SirGanjalf> AJIsAwesome: PARTEH TIME?
<PONY> come herw
<AJIsAwesome> One is terrible, the other is a complete abomination.
<PONY> said the subs
<Serenity> Slen: After anal
<DerpyMuffins> Cock block
<alexxm|colt> sexy times for all
<Slen> Serenity no.
<Dark92Enigma> SHIPCEPTION
<DerpyMuffins> Video chat bitch
<SafariMonkey> Iwa: Yeah I was going to say or very right if you want low ratings
<JT> what about 1 till 5?
<SafariMonkey> OK brb
<HurricaneAkumin> Dat sub typo
<Kencolt> Hat. Of course.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: FiM Six-Pack of Books Spotted by Sibsy

<EEVERSTI> gotta. have. the. soundtrack.
<DerpyMuffins> Hmm
<LordDerpington> Oh, cool - my niece and nephew have some books similar to that (Thomas the Tank Engine and Disney Princess themed, but hey).
<DerpyMuffins> Good job merika
<Sonny> heli?
<Serenity> And stupidly enough, AFRICA survives this whole thing like nothing happened
<Sonny> how?
<Sonny> how is there a heli???
<Michael> good job world
<Sonny> what's going on???
<JT> Derpymuffins, we need them monnies
<Serenity> They'll be like "dafuq happened wherever else"
<Sonny> it doesn't make sence!?
<Lil_B> EEVERSTI really? I love Soundtracks too, but I don't think this Movie has great music :/
<HurricaneAkumin> Sonny: The world flooded. Now everyone's living inside a ship.
<LunAnonymous> Finland didn't even notice, we were probably too drunk.
<DerpyMuffins> Africa is ignored throughout the movie and now is just being mentioned?
<Kandarihu> I see what looks like helipads on the top of the arks
<Dark_Horst> Sonny: it doesnt occur to you that these enormous ships might ahve helipads?
<SirGanjalf> I bless the rains down in Aaaafricaaaaaa.
<spud> hi everypony:)
<d3rb> whole world destroyed...still thanking god...
<Michael> go africa!
<Sonny> Dark_Horst: Lies!
<Blaze> 14idgi D:
<smrtgy1> spud: HAI
<Michael> hai spud
<EEVERSTI> Lil_B i think this ending soundtrack is awesome
<DerpyMuffins> Dat pun
<Cades> me neither haha
<Lil_B> sooo... does that mean there are potentionally more Africans now than any other erm... nationality?
<spud> whos streaming?
<Sonny> BOOOOM
<Serenity> Lil_B: Pretty much
<Sonny> everyone died
<CriticKitten> If it never flooded, then I think you're going to have to explain why you deserve to live there. The Africans will want to know. >_>
<Sonny> da end btcheeaaasss
<AJIsAwesome> spud: Caramel.
<PONY> Lil_B: Yes.
<Cypresswolf> We'll find a new fertile land and we'll call it....This Land
<DerpyMuffins> So everybody becomes Africans now?
<cachi01> WTFBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
<JT> it does Lil_b it does
<Sonny> everyone must always die at the end
<PONY> Africa doesn't even know something happebned
<Sonny> cachi01: perfect
<Iwa> CriticKitten: Second Apartheid? Oh god
<smrtgy1> Aaaaaand meteor.
<Sonny> lol
<DerpyMuffins> Why did they need money in the first place?
<EEVERSTI> and then they all died... THE END
<Trixieburgfan1337> and then they had lots and lots of babies. The End.
<Sonny> just go boom already
<BroPony|MEDIC> Planet Africa FTW
<Serenity> Buffer
<Michael> only africa will stand
<flutterchu> 10/ mutherflutting 10
<Lil_B> EEVERSTI it's not bad, but ... I don't know, very dull just
<PONY> massive orgy
<Sonny> WHAT THE FU- BOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<smrtgy1> ALIEN ATTACK
<DerpyMuffins> I bet you Luna is laughing her flank off
<Dark_Horst> i think the reasoning behind this is that africa was a main-componant of pangaea
<PONY> 2013/10
<Bluestrom_S> wooo
<spud> so wats was that?
<Serenity> Africa/10
<Trixieburgfan1337> i dont get it....
<BroPony|MEDIC> EETS RHUAWSHUNN/10
*cachi01 claps slowly.....very slowly....
<Slen> 9001/10
<Sonny> DerpyMuffins: Bwahahaha xD genius
<Kothenion> Mayan Prophecy / 10
<Lil_B> EEVERSTI well, this song isn't bad xD
<cachi01> that was uhmm interesting
<Shootaloo> YURI/10
<d3rb> charlie/10
<HurricaneAkumin> Awwwww
<ASoftFluffyThing> ENGINE ON/10
<BroPony|MEDIC> Sasha/10
<cachi01> 21/12
<CriticKitten> Shit movie is absolute shit.
<Bluestrom_S> this movie is less than 2 months away too!!!
<Sonny> 8.7/10
<Slen> Yuri :'(
<AdamTheDuck> It's Russian/10
<AJIsAwesome> 5/10
<d3rb> CriticKitten, i second that
<Michael> 10/12
<cachi01> 3/10
<Bluestrom_S> those ships are already build by now
<Sonny> 10/0
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gordon/10
<Lil_B> 6/10, best visuals I've ever seen, weak Story
<LunAnonymous> I found it quite believable.
<Kandarihu> According to TVTropes, Roland Emmerich made this movie to be his final disaster movie. And that's why he went out with a bang.
<spud> so what movie was that?
<Sonny> divide by zero
<BroPony|MEDIC> 2/10
<JT> they should have streamed this the same week as 21/12
<DerpyMuffins> Sasha/10
<Sonny> the world ends
<flutterchu> 20/12
<SirGanjalf> Too bad Madagascar didn't survive - it's a good shelter in case of pandemy.
<Dark_Horst> if you can ignore the blazing rape of logic, its actually not such a bad movie
<Dark92Enigma> My take on this film: The effects as always, are great, and there is some story to keep it balanced (sorta), and the soundtrack is also envolving, but if you were looking forward to this for ,mythology or survivelance issues alone, this ISN'T YOUR MOVIE. We all know WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIE THIS DECEMBER 21st! THIS IS F***ING HOLLYWOOD HAVING FUN WITH A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE, THAT'S ALL 5/10
<LordDerpington> Well, that was terrible. The science was garbage, the story haphazard, most of the characters were broadly-drawn caricatures, the dialogue was excruciating, the symbolism about as subtle as a brick to the face... but it was fun watching it with Bronystate.
<HurricaneAkumin> Well...it was an okay movie. But i don't like movies about things that i don't think will happen.
<JT> 8/10
<Cypresswolf> :3 I went a bit heavy on the whiskey during this movie - I feel loopy 6_9
<EEVERSTI> 2012/10
<DerpyMuffins> Dat text wall
<pony_5449> still better love story than twilight
<LunAnonymous> I mean, this has happened before, it says so in the bible
<Serenity> Only think that's true about this film is yellowstone
<spud> so what movie was that?
<d3rb> text mountain
<Serenity> Apparently, yellowstone is gonna fuck America up
<Eli> 10/2012

<AJIsAwesome> Night, EEVERSTI. :)
<cachi01> god's rage/10
<twilight_sprinkle> bye EEVERSTI
<Eli> thx twilight_sprinkle ;)
<Serenity> Lil_B: That won't be for a few decades yet
<twilight_sprinkle> np
<JT> cachi01 looks awesome but whats the thing in the middle?
<Serenity> But yellowstone is due for 21/12/12
<Slen> Discord's Revenge/10
<Serenity> Wierdly enough
<SirGanjalf> Lil_B: There's a supervolcano in middle europe? Dammit, i live there!
<Eli> Serenity: more like centuries maybe millenias
<twilight_sprinkle> ukrainian, not russian!/10
<Serenity> SirGanjalf: There's been one for millions of years
<cachi01> JT: books apparently
<Dark92Enigma> I forgot to mention the acting is MEDIOCRE, and the symbolism is as subtle as a STAB TO THE EYE WITH A FUCKING SALAD FORK
<Lil_B> SirGanjalf me too, I'm less than 500KM away from there
<JT> books? :S about what?XD
<Blaze> 14so bored today......DX
<cachi01> JT: sibsy found them on a store
<smrtgy1> SYMBOLISM
<JT> oh
<cachi01> JT: so hasbro didnt even knew about this
<Serenity> Closest Volcano to me is Icelands
<smrtgy1> DO YOU SEE???
<CriticKitten> Dark92Enigma: I think you understated it.
<d3rb> ^
<Eli> the next big thing that's really gonna happen are big earthquakes in Japan, Island and India
<JT> thats a bit scary for hasbro XD
<SirGanjalf> Lil_B: So where exactly is that volcano?
<LunAnonymous> so basically fanfic sold in stores... great.
<twilight_sprinkle> mfw when peopl seriously review a b movie disaster flick
<Squallken> i cant what for 12/21/2012 for this whole "end of the world" hype to be over
<JT> well they printed out past sins, Lunanonymous
<HurricaneAkumin> I didn't notice any symbolisim in this movie, but whatever. :P
<DerpyMuffins> Symbolism/10
<CubanAmericanBrony> At least when Yellowstone blows I know I'll be killed immediately and not suffer in the aftermath
<Serenity> Squallken: Just get a few coats and some central heating money, because it's gonna be freezing
<d3rb> twilight_sprinkle, but it looked like the movie was trying to be taken serriously
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: YFW this was a major motion picture that cost hundreds of millions to make, and is only a B because it's such an abysmal piece of shit.
<Lil_B> SirGanjalf Germany, erm, I think the mountain range called Eifel
<twilight_sprinkle> d3rb: maybe, but it was obvious it was bad hours ago
<Serenity> Also, the ash cloud might affect the Internet
<d3rb> true
<Serenity> Which if it does, I'll blow the rest of the world up myself
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: it was obviously bad hours ago,no need to keep repeating it
<CriticKitten> No, I think it can't be repeated enough.
<smrtgy1> It was bad at the title card :P
<SirGanjalf> Yeah, 21/12 gonna be the biggest "THE END IS NIGH" freakout since end of the millenium.
<HurricaneAkumin> What was the A movie like? I missed it.
<JT> Well atm the netherlands already need dike's to keep the water out... aldo I don't want to drown...
<spud> long credits are long
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: of course.
<CriticKitten> It's not just bad, it's downright insulting and callous. >_>
<BroPony|MEDIC> 2012 doesnt predict the end of the world
<d3rb> we need the core for next week, that is a great b movie
<Dark92Enigma> CriticKitten: i think we could complain more about this movie but..........guess what? it's rob emmerich's FINAL MOVIE! yaaaaaaaaayyyy
<twilight_sprinkle> HurricaneAkumin: pans labirynth
<JT> Well as always, some said it was shit and some said it was awesome HurricaAkumin
<CriticKitten> Dark92Enigma: Thank god. <_<
<Serenity> d3rb: The Core and Armegeddan
<Trixieburgfan1337> i give it a 6/10. just ur standard hollywood movie. All flash, almost no substance
<Eli> about those supervulcanos: the earth crust is more or less divided into 13 bigger pieces. everywhere these pieces push into each other, there is hte possibility of earthquakes and vulcanos. it also forms mountains. so basically if you live on a mountain have fun
<Lil_B> I like Roland Emmerich more than Michael Bay because Roland doesn't insult the Audience as much as Bay doesn. Also no Racist or Piss jokes
<SirGanjalf> Lil_B: I see
<d3rb> Serenity, hell yes
<SaxyPretender> 0,14wait, 2012 was his last movie?
<HurricaneAkumin> twilight_sprinkle: No, i mean the plot. I already checked the website for the name, but i wanna know the plot.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<BroPony|MEDIC> ^
<JT> Eli: what if you live under ground lvl?
<Eli> SaxyPretender: yeeeeeeees
<CriticKitten> Saxy, just do what normal people do.
<Serenity> SaxyPretender: Hahaa
<Slen> On the 20th of Dec. I'm the one who will be wearing one of those cardbord "THE END IS NEAR!" Sign.
<Dark92Enigma> SaxyPretender: YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS
<CriticKitten> Go watch SyFy's movies instead.
<Slen> Jk.
<Eli> JT: :| do you really think taht would matter in an earthquake?
<d3rb> will the world end before S3 is finished?
<SirGanjalf> TBH - i don't think i could watch this movie if it wasn't the chat
<CriticKitten> They're ALL about the world ending, they're ALL campy as shit, and at least they can be laughed at.
<LunAnonymous> December 20th i'll be robbing all the stores!
<Slen> We should watch Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.
<Serenity> Slen: I might wear a sign saying "I'm looking forward to the 22nd"
<BroPony|MEDIC> d3rb: Nothing will happen
<JT> Eli, Idk XD
<Iwa> Slen: We will, next week
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I liked Godzilla!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14And Independence Day!
<Slen> Yay.
<Eli> JT: if anything, you would be more fucked
*cachi01 eats SaxyPretender
<twilight_sprinkle> i give 2012 a 8/10 becasse it wasnt boring the first time i watched it, although it annoys me how they didnt bother to do research on the plane even, the writers had a boner ofor everything russian apparently
<Cades> :(
<d3rb> BroPony|MEDIC, well as long as it holds off till s3 is done im fine
<Serenity> SaxyPretender: Godzilla should TOTALLY be streamed here
<Serenity> I'm sure one of them will be A
<HurricaneAkumin> I give it 5.4/10

<Iwa> Chao: Valid assumption, but the asperger syndrome is too broad a spectrum to be certain off :S
<Trixieburgfan1337> Chao: twilight is more ocd. checking and making list is ocd stuff.

<Saturn> 08,01as in smoothness of interface, or responsiveness of operation?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm waiting for iOS 6 :I
<Spell-of-Gaming> iOS 6 jailbreak, I mean
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/a/src/1351376317018.png kill everything
<Bronysith> thats what ill do
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: both actually from what ive seen
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: i disagree on the second, actually
<d3rb> Bronysith, really......please tell me thats a joke
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: that wont be true for much longer, android devices are coming out with better screens and some of the latest devices have the same or even more ppi than the iPhone
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: Which version of android? Which phone? (hope I'm not being too nosy) && (I'm waiting for it to load)
<Saturn> 08,01and with the new version of android, they've completely rewritten the ui routines
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Vocal Music: Carnival Cat vs. Ponyville / Dear Luna / A Moon Ballad
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: ICS on a Desire Z
<Spell-of-Gaming> STREAM
<DerpyMuffins> Dat GigabitHarmonie
<AdamTheDuck> MUUUUUSICC!
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: impossible, they cant have better screens. the iphones have a retina display which is the best, display-wise it can be
<diddutz> 'Tavi :3
<cachi01> STREAAAAAAAAAM
<d3rb> this music conflicts with my techno
*AdamTheDuck glomps GigabitHarmonie !
<cachi01> GigabitHarmonie: perfect music :D
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Octavia
<twilight_sprinkle> wooo classical~
<ASoftFluffyThing> GigabitHarmonie~
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: Nice, I have ICS too
*DerpyMuffins glomps GigabitHarmonie
<Kandarihu> Hey GigabitHarmonie
<GigabitHarmonie> :)
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: all the iPhone has over other devices is ppi
<oni_link> in terms of the display
<Yahooz> Oh, is the podcast on now?
<DerpyMuffins> Where is Allegr0?
<cachi01> btw looks like theres a trailer for dead island 2
<Saturn> 08,01i cannot survive without a keyboard on my phone
<Spell-of-Gaming> This is pre-show
<J_E_Smith71> Yahooz: Pre-show, actual show starts in an hour
<SafariMonkey> Yay GigabitHarmonie! I might just stay. :/
<Saturn> 08,01so i <3 my Desire Z
<Iwa> My South African Rosé Pinotage is happy with this stream :)
<Yahooz> k
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: well idk, from what i saw the android are pretty slow to load anything
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: but idk about the new ones
<Yahooz> Im working on college apps, i dont think ill make it tonight :/
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: android is still better imo
<DerpyMuffins> You an Octavia fan GigabitHarmonie?
<cachi01> GigabitHarmonie: yolo
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: in general yes, but in terms of phones, atm imo iphone is better
<cachi01> you obviously love octavia
<Cypresswolf> :) that music is wonderlul
<d3rb> wasnt the retina display only in name and wasnt technially a retina display?
<Yahooz> I've actually formed a proof that YOLO > capre diem
<oni_link> Saturn: I used to be like that too, it was the reason I stuck with a Droid for so long but they are dreadful, they have the worst update schedule. ICS and Jellybean have great on screen keyboards. If you were still on Froyo or Gingerbread even, I could understand why.
<J_E_Smith71> LOTS OF STUFF ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU SICK
<Spell-of-Gaming> Android easily wins when iPhone isn't jailbroken
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: in terms of ppi its unbeatable because retina, but its also excellent color-wise
<DerpyMuffins> Great another debate on BState
<DerpyMuffins> Where is my muffins
<J_E_Smith71> Psycho, or when your mind goes, and when you've had enough of doing grown-up stuff...
<d3rb> Derpy_Hooves, its the best part of bronystate
<DerpyMuffins> Tab fail
<cachi01> debates debates everywhere
<SafariMonkey> cachi01: yolo? seriously? yello would have at least been better
<DerpyMuffins> I feel sorry for ya Derpy_Hooves
<d3rb> yes...tab fail..... :(
<AJIsAwesome> Testing...
<cachi01> SafariMonkey: yello?
<Yahooz> no the best part of bronystate WAS stuff that happened back in the day
<BroPony|MEDIC> Bye everyponay
<Spell-of-Gaming> I rarely have any tab fails
<Yahooz> not any of this shtufff
<DerpyMuffins> Cya BroPony|MEDIC

<SafariMonkey> Classical music promotes brain function
<DerpyMuffins> ^false
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: it also depends on which iOS device we are talking about here.
<d3rb> Spell-of-Gaming, its a bad feel man
<GigabitHarmonie> :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye Bro--gone
<twilight_sprinkle> DerpyMuffins: actually its been proven that piano music stimulates the brain
<Spell-of-Gaming> When I do, I apologize too much
<DerpyMuffins> Is it on loop GigabitHarmonie?
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: im talking specifically about the iphone
<Derpy_Hooves> http://s0rr0wsedge.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5j8bda
<cachi01> thx to tenacious D i cant listen to this piece seriously now :D
<thelonepony> Hi Everypony :)
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: but the 4, 4S or 5?
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: i've tried the onscreen keyboards, and i honestly think they are great for typing english
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, thelonepony. :)
<Saturn> 08,01but half of what i do on my phone is server admin in a terminal
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: 4s, or 4 i guess, since theyre similar
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Shizuka Derpy_Hooves
<Saturn> 08,01and the OSKs are useless in that context
<Cades> back
<maty_sky> Hi all
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: also when i was buying, iphone 4s was cheaper than the androids i was thinking of getting
<Derpy_Hooves> http://s0rr0wsedge.deviantart.com/#/d5j8815
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi maty_sky
<Yahooz> How many more does MadMax have in her queque Derpy_Hooves?
<PoniesMaid47> Guys I just played wave 666. It was awesoem O_O
<SafariMonkey> DerpyMuffins: Not saying it's scientifically proven or anything, I know it's been debunked, but it does on a different level. It does force your brain to work differently on logical and emotional levels.
<PoniesMaid47> *awesome
<maty_sky> I just discovered mlp a week or two ago
<cachi01> PoniesMaid47: cool :)
<maty_sky> watched 1st season so far :)
<Ponies47> Change me nic back
<Ponies47> *nick
<cachi01> maty_sky: welcome to the herd :)
<oni_link> Saturn: ah makes sense. you would have wait for the keyboard to pop out and it wouldnt work as well for you. terminal with an OSK isnt fun
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Ponies47
<AJIsAwesome> maty_sky: Welcome to Bronystate! Make sure to read the rules and FAQ, please. :)

*Ponies47 Waves at LadyCanary "Hi"
<SafariMonkey> DerpyMuffins: It stimulates the brain. This doesn't mean that little kids who listen to it are really smart.
<DerpyMuffins> Hai LadyCanary

<AdamTheDuck> Hello there my fine sir MadSurge.
<Ponies47> Till Nov 8th
<Ponies47> I think
<Ponies47> GigabitHarmonie: Have you played wave 666 yet?
<DerpyMuffins> Allegr0 is missing out
<DerpyMuffins> This is awesome
<SafariMonkey> Hi GigabitHarmonie. Interestingly, you and allegr0 when you announced the Pixel Perfect Pony show's name were the first thing I ever saw on stream. So you have a special place in my heart. :)
<Ponies47> ^
*Saturn 08,01steals GigabitHarmonie
<DerpyMuffins> Give him back!
*GigabitHarmonie hugs Saturn! :) I'm stolen!
<Blaze> 14Okay so guys, I have a question.
<Derpy_Hooves> http://s0rr0wsedge.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5j8ae1
<Ponies47> Darnit I've been missing thw show! D:
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sweet
<MadSurge> OH YEAH :$
<LadyCanary> Whoa! Now that's pretty neat~
<ASoftFluffyThing> How is it? Like, do you need tickets for it like in Mann Up?
*AdamTheDuck hits Ponies47 with a spoon "Bad Ponies47, missing the Pixel Pefect Pony Show is bad." :|
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: You were playing TF2 with me! :[
*Ponies47 Smacks AdamTheDuck across the face with a frying pan
<Blaze> 14Would vampires be prone to AIDS? o_O
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, and I left the stream on and killed zombie robots to classical music!
<cachi01> guys what does riptide means?
<DerpyMuffins> What you mean cachi01?
<Cades> yes
<cachi01> DerpyMuffins: the word riptide what does it mean?
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: if we are talking about the display itself, the 4S is at 326 ppi and android devices now are around that area as well. if they were to just use a different type of display rather than PenTile (which is dreadful) then they would be on par. But that retina display is damn good, I will give it that.
<SafariMonkey> GigabitHarmonie: Just wanted you to know that.
<Mutterguy> hi all. I'm awake up again
<Blaze> 14But would they be able to catch it and die from it? That's the question.
<cachi01> hi Mutterguy :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Mutterguy. :)
<Ponies47> Nope
<DerpyMuffins> cachi01 http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/riptide?s=t
<GigabitHarmonie> Good to know SafariMonkey! :)
<GigabitHarmonie> <3
<Mutterguy> although not enough it seems...
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: well retina display is literally perfect ppi-wise, because its the most ppi the human eye can see
<SafariMonkey> :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Mutterguy
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: hence the retina name
<cachi01> Derpy_Hooves: thx :)
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: actually, it's not
<Saturn> 08,01it's close though
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: yeah but then again thats Apple giving things cute names

<DerpyMuffins> The tab fail count is over 100 by now
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: close enough
<SafariMonkey> GigabitHarmonie: To be clear, it's not just that, it's earned a right to it since.
<cachi01> GigabitHarmonie: wait i had to send the email right now? cause i send mine last saturday lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Then...what's the goal?

<LadyCanary> Meanwhile! \:3/
<oni_link> aww, only one day left for L4D2, its super cheap. I wanna get it but not sure if I should. I always buy games compulsively when theyre on sale
<Spell-of-Gaming> I know Hetalia
<Brenna_Hooves> flutterchu: I was answering my door for it to only be my sister who got locked out of the house
<DerpyMuffins> I already bought one oni_link
<Brenna_Hooves> PASTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

<Spell-of-Gaming> No.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Just, no
<Brenna_Hooves> oh....
<Brenna_Hooves> :I
<Meanwhile> Chat sure is riveting this hour.
<AJIsAwesome> Spell-of-Gaming: I've heard of the show, but not of the fandom. Care to explain why you do not like the fandom?
<oni_link> DerpyMuffins: Ahhh, Im gonna give in and get it later today >.< since its like 5 USD
<Iwa> oni_link: Enough friends to do co-op with, like shooters, and is it cheaper than an average dinner at a restaurant? If yes: Buy :)
<Meanwhile> Truly I haven't been quite this entertained since that one time I tripped in the kitchen and smacked my face on a hanging pot.
<Ponies47> Zombies
<Bronysith> Spell-of-Gaming: does hetallia really have that horrible of a fandom?
<SaxyPretender|GG> 0,14yes
<Ponies47> and tons of them
<SaxyPretender|GG> 0,14yes it does
<AJIsAwesome> How so?

<Brenna_Hooves> I think I know AJIsAwesome. LOTS OF DIRTY THINGS
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Why not?
<Lyra`> as much as i love classical, this seems a bit too whimsical for my taste
<Iwa> oni_link: Good for you :3
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Lyra`
<Brenna_Hooves> But Im not in that part of the fandom
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender|GG: which is worse, naruto or hetallia in terms of fandom then?
<Lyra`> i prefer more subdewed pieces, with a slower melody
<Lyra`> oh, hai DerpyMuffins
<cachi01> Brenna_Hooves pls more hentai = cooler fandom
<SafariMonkey> GigabitHarmonie: "No results found for "preludium una fuga"" I'll try more general search. (similar terms)
<ASoftFluffyThing> That sound so awesome
<SafariMonkey> :(
<Iwa> oni_link: You might also give Rock of Ages a play, since it's free this weekend (assuming you use steam for that sale)

<flutterchu> cachi01: Balloon: yeah i know
<Brenna_Hooves> NO SHE IS NOT A WITCH... SHE IS A CAT WITH BOOBS
<AJIsAwesome> I mean seeing a cat with breasts would be..... interesting. :S

<Iwa> Meanwhile: That's actually the exact way I describe every classical piece except this one :P
<cachi01> implying gangnam style is epic.
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: stop giving me pings
<Meanwhile> Iwa: Well aren't you ironic.
<Brenna_Hooves> Bronysith yea it is
<SafariMonkey> Brenna_Hooves: How dare you listen to that instead of Beethoven?
<twilight_sprinkle> gangnam style is as epic as flushing toilet
<Iwa> Meanwhile: Oooh yes...I am :)
<cachi01> Bronysith: yeah...................NO
<Brenna_Hooves> AYYYYYYY SEXY LADEHHHHHH

<SaxyPretender|GG> 0,14clearly you all are fools for not having Guilty Gear music as DA BESSSSSSSS

<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: >implying flushing a toilet isnt epic
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: How am I giving you pings?
<SafariMonkey> Two steps from hell!
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i agree. give it a month or two and no one will remember it
<Brenna_Hooves> AYYYYYYYYYYYYY SEXEH LADEHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Lyra`> i know its one of his more famous pieces, but nocturne just has a certain elegant grace that touches my taste just in the right way
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: i hope so
<Bronysith> Eli: it is going to last forever
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: fur ELIse?
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: Fur *eli*se

<Meanwhile> Seriously, it was funny the first like, 5 times but then everyone everywhere started doing it and it just became "Please move on."
<Brenna_Hooves> I WANNA SEE OCTAVIA DOING THE GANGNAM STYLE DANCE
<flutterchu> the stream is that were listening to a DVD called "Octavia's Favorite track's" (including night of the bumblebee for a liminted time)
<Bronysith> i think gangnam style has a few more months to another year before it gets old
<Bronysith> and then everyone hates it
<diddutz> Brenna_Hooves: I don't think she'd agree...
<DerpyMuffins> flutterchu its Flight of the Bumblebee
<Brenna_Hooves> diddutz she doesnt have to *creepy face*

<Brenna_Hooves> I LOVE ROAD TO EL DARADO
<Brenna_Hooves> (spelt that wrong)
<diddutz> Eli: most frustrationing are players who try to fight with a rocket/sticky Jumper imo ...
<Lyra`> that didnt even sound classical
<Lyra`> it sounds more bluesy
<Lyra`> nvm
<oni_link> lol
<Brenna_Hooves> :'(
<flutterfan1990> <SafariMonkey> so...who's your favorite character, mine's kinda obvious
<DerpyMuffins> Impatient as always Lyra`
<PeachStreak|cake> Brenna_Hooves: u a bro to PewDiePie?
<Lyra`> hey, i love blues
<Meanwhile> flutterfan1990: It's Rarity.
<Lyra`> and jazz
<Lyra`> and soul
<PeachStreak|cake> cause I heard Ruben and he yells that every so often
<Lyra`> and oooooold rock
<GigabitHarmonie> >George Gershwin
<Eli> diddutz: or generally anyone who kills others during merasmus fight
<PeachStreak|cake> Lyra`: what about dubstep
<Brenna_Hooves> PeachStreak YES
<twilight_sprinkle> >GigabitHarmonie
<PeachStreak|cake> YAYAYA
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8286/

<Brenna_Hooves> Bronysith: HAHAHAHAHA
<ASoftFluffyThing|LoS> Bronysith, what?

<cachi01> Bronysith: me when a fly passes by
<oni_link> hahahaha
<Brenna_Hooves> I AM AN AIRPLANE IN MY GYM CLASS
<Brenna_Hooves> no joke
<PeachStreak|cake> cachi01: bout the same here
<Brenna_Hooves> EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN MY GYM CLASS CALLS ME AIRPLANE BRENNA
<ASoftFluffyThing|LoS> cachi01, replace 'fly' with 'awasp'
<ASoftFluffyThing|LoS> wasp*
<SafariMonkey> Sorry I missed the past 2 messages to me due to freeze. Can somepony fill me in?
<SafariMonkey> Please?
<Lyra`> this hardly sounds classical
<DerpyMuffins> Its in the eye of the beholder Lyra`
<Lyra`> its very swingish
<PeachStreak|cake> how come the mylittlefacewhen site no work for me? :(
<Lyra`> i guess it was ahead of its time
<Mutterguy> It's was composed in the 1920's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapsody_in_Blue
<AJIsAwesome> [19:42:27] <flutterfan1990> I<SafariMonkey> I must admit I love her flair for fashion designing, even if my attemps have been....unsuccessful,lol
<oni_link> Im gonna play AC Revelations while the pre-show is on :P This is nice to listen to, I gotta make an effort to catch the show more often
<GigabitHarmonie> "In 1924, Gershwin composed his first major classical work, Rhapsody in Blue, for orchestra and piano. It was orchestrated by Ferde Grofé and premiered by Paul Whiteman's concert band in New York. It proved to be his most popular work."
<Mutterguy> It's probably one of those borderline things
<Lyra`> that would explain it
<Cades> we all left did we? haha
<diddutz> now it sounds like the OST from a cartoon
<Brenna_Hooves> INTRO OF DARKNESS THEN REDNESS THEN WHITENESS
<Brenna_Hooves> :3

<ShadowQuill> I'm depressed now.
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: dunno if you like anime, but if you do, evangelion is one hell of a mindfuck
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<AJIsAwesome> It's mainly an action/psycological anime.
<Meanwhile> I'm sure someone can take them off your hands.
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: is there a manga of it?
<AJIsAwesome> Pretty sure there is.
<Spell-of-Gaming> This sounds like something you'd hear from a cartoon back in the old days
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: probably, theres almost always a manga
<MaxTheBrony> Oh this :D
<Lyra`> <3
<RDash5000> i have just recently gotten into the world of anime. im so lost...

<Spell-of-Gaming> How many people here have weird attention spans?

<Eli> Derpy_Hooves: so many good things come form there. just not the language
<SafariMonkey> Eli: I was on a client, I didn't actually see stream most of the time

<DerpyMuffins> Nope
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: i keep tabfailing you
<J_E_Smith71> GigabitHarmonie: I love it how you and Allegr0 have been doing this classic music streams recently
<Lyra`> its so delicate, and that rolling rise of notes at this point with just a hesitant touch to it, like a nervous lover for the first time, escalating to a bolder tones like that of the touch of one youve known for ages, its a wonderful piece, filled with the gentle touch of one you want to hold close, and fills a person with a certain longing to be a better person.
<RDash5000> i freakin' love music like this
<Meanwhile> Hah. Gaaaaaay.
<DerpyMuffins> You should be apologizing to Derpy_Hooves for tab failing Eli
<twilight_sprinkle> DerpyMuffins: because france has a loooooot of composers
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: anyways, thre's a lot of good music coming from france. even now
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and of course i want Crone's dome
<flutterfan1990> too true Lyra
<SafariMonkey> Lyra`: Your name befits you well. :)
