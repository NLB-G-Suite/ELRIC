<MadSurge> jcelios: :S
<jcelios> AND THE CALL WAS COMING FROM INSTEAD THE HOUSE
<MadSurge> *:D
<CriticKitten> That's ridiculous, everyone knows houses can't speak.
<jcelios> then who was phone
<jcelios> ?
<LadyCanary> If they could speak....
<AJIsHaunter> CriticKitten: When you're around, of course. ;)
<LadyCanary> The stories they would tell. I mean the people who lived in my house before me and my family were religious nuts.
<Shizuka> 13we should not let houses talk
<Meanwhile> But how will they tell you it's not lupus?
<LadyCanary> Or if someone is robbing the house
<Shizuka> 13but
<Shizuka> 13well
<Shizuka> 13make the house move then
<Shizuka> 13at least then it can do something about robbers
<Meanwhile> Tbh if you're within earshot of the house I'd like to think you'd notice someone robbing it.
<CriticKitten> It's never lupus, so they don't need to tell us.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/9vx9y.png
<Kipkat07_USAF> should I buy a game without my mom's permission? Its 29.99 and I have wanted it for a while

<Kipkat07_USAF> Rollercoaster Tycoon 3
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i had enough for it after i bought kingdom hearts 3D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> the one time
<AJIsHaunter> Kipkat07_USAF: RT3? I think that's fine.

<Kipkat07_USAF> Michael: Torrent?
<Michael> Kipkat07_USAF: mom
<Michael> *moment
<Kipkat07_USAF> Its on steam
<thelonecubone|DI> okay i'm back
*Serenity1 is pissing around with 384mb worth of RAM chips and an intel motherboard
<jcelios> 384?
<jcelios> weird number
<Serenity1> Also with a 32mb GPU and 1.2gh/z pentium 2 processor
<Kipkat07_USAF> I want to get FC3 on steam too but my computer cant even run AC3 and can barely (IMMENSE LAG) run Skyrim
<Serenity1> 384 = 128 x 3
<Michael> Kipkat07_USAF: sry :( i got only spanish version
<Serenity1> Some computers ran on 3 RAM chips rather than 2
<Zawan> Kipkat07_USAF: just wait for steam sale
<Serenity1> With a 24 bit soundcard
<aniderp|bestcakeever> people
<Serenity1> Only has stero, no surround
<Meanwhile> Trying to go one on one with a max at point blank. Yeah that'll end well.
<Kipkat07_USAF> I want to check if I can upgrade my RAM but my mom would rip my arms off and beat me to death with them
<aniderp|bestcakeever> tell dat jaymoo i may be nap when he get on
<Kipkat07_USAF> shes super paranoid about my computer
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ok?
<Serenity1> Kipkat07_USAF: One sec, matey
<Serenity1> What motherboard do you have?
<Kipkat07_USAF> every time I run tests on my computer she has a heart attack
<Kipkat07_USAF> Serenity1: IDK one sec
<Serenity1> That's an odd model
<Serenity1> Never heard of it...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> people tell jaymoo that i will be napping ok?
<Chrysalis> Saturn you there
<Kipkat07_USAF> HP SR5707C

<Serenity> Kipkat07_USAF: It likes up to 4gb
<Serenity> Sorry that took some time, the usual site didn't have that model wierdly enough
<Kipkat07_USAF> Serenity: past that?
<jcelios> are you on a 64bit OS?
<Serenity> If you use 64 bit, then you can make use of the ful 4gb, but if you're on 32 bit, then you can only use 2.5 or 3.5
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek poniez :3c
<LadyCanary> NO WAI
<AJIsHaunter> Ohai, SB.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D

*thelonecubone gives SuperBrony64 poniez
<cratorkid> if you guys are wondering wheather you can run the game, it may be on canyourunit.com i think
<Serenity> Basically, 4gb max is safe, might be able to sneak 5gb somehow, but I don't think that's a good idea
<Serenity> Espeically when you're using HP
*SuperBrony64|AFK plays with the poniez :3
<AJIsHaunter> "NO WAY?" "NO WAY!"
<ACS13123> SuperBrony64|AFK: Can I play with u :3

<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Did you know that they made a Street Fighter movie a long time ago?
<LadyCanary> OF COURSE.
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64|AFK: I do. :D
<thelonecubone> SuperBrony64|AFK: oh yeah
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02...and then they made a game based off that movie
<Vordox> SuperBrony64|AFK: Which of the 3?
<Michael> and the sequels
<AJIsHaunter> Best movie ever.
<thelonecubone> forgotten about it
<LadyCanary> Because, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02So it was Street Fighter: The Movie The Game
<Michael> also a mario movie
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02And it sucked :P
<Shizuka> 13pff you all forget the greatest movie to game conversion ever
<AJIsHaunter> LadyCanary: "OF COURSE!"
<LadyCanary> But for me, it was tuesday.
<Vordox> Shizuka: ET?
<Shizuka> 13super mario brothers
<Serenity> The Mario film isn't bad when you forget it's Mario
<LadyCanary> IKR?!
<Vordox> Shizuka: DON'T DISS THAT MOVIE; IT WAS AWESOME
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02But...but...
<Meanwhile> Trust the fungus.
<Michael> mario movie was best movie
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Mario was a game before a movie ;^;
<Buytoast> i thought it was pretty shitty that they scrweed up the goomba designs in teh game so much
<Shizuka> 13was not
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02D:
<Buytoast> how can they be so off course
<Vordox> was too
<Bronysith> what i dont get is
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02ARE TOO
<Bronysith> how are they making a shadow of the colossus movie?
<jcelios> YALL WHACK
<Buytoast> they're what?
<AJIsHaunter> Buytoast: Making a Shadow Of The Collosus movie.
<Michael> also a Legend of Zelda i heard
<Buytoast> well then
<jcelios> SoC could make a cool artsy movie
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Candy Land: The Movie 'Just when you thought things were all candy and sweets...'
<jcelios> to bad it won't be that and will suck lol
<Buytoast> get that genny turkadashi guy on it
<Buytoast> he can probably make a good one
<thelonecubone> SuperBrony64|AFK: sounds more like a horro/gore movie
<Shizuka> 13monopoly
<Shizuka> 13the movie
<thelonecubone> horror*
<Buytoast> imagine a Lord Licorice torture scene
<Buytoast> how...
<Buytoast> delicious
<AJIsHaunter> To be honest, SoC would seem like a pretty good movie if it was done right.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Shizuka: Think that's called Fahrenheit 9/11
<ThunderBreeze> Good Evening everybrony!
<Michael> hai ThunderBreeze
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, ThunderBreeze.
<thelonecubone> Hi ThunderBreeze
<Buytoast> Monopoly "It's all fun and games...until you go straight to jail."
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Hai ThunderBreeze :D
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Starring Rob Schnieder?
<ThunderBreeze> What do you mean?
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02He's in all those cheesy movies
<AJIsHaunter> ThunderBreeze: Talking about board games being made into movies. :D
<ThunderBreeze> Monopoly made into a Movie?...yuk
<thelonecubone> what about yatzee
<thelonecubone> :>
<LadyCanary> ALSO Clue.
<thelonecubone> that too
<Buytoast> Rob Schieder is the wacky Uncle Moneybags in this heartwarming family comedy! Falsely accused of a housing scheme, Moneybags must go around the city and clear his name, or else he'll GO directly to jail!"
<Michael> what about a movie about Trivial Pursuit ?
<Meanwhile> I hate it already.
<Bronysith> Clue was a good movie
<Buytoast> Rated PG for mild violence and pattial nudity.
<Buytoast> partial
<ThunderBreeze> Around the city? why not around the U.S.A since the Properties names were based on states?
<Buytoast> goddamn it sounds like some crappy cross between Arthur and the fugitive

<Socks> C++, You accidently create a dozen instances of yourself and shoot them all in the foot. Providing emergency medical assistance is impossible since you can't tell which are bitwise copies and which are just pointing at others and saying "That's me, over there."

<pony_3045> use torrent
<pony_3045> be bad guy
<JFFS> Hi everyone! :)
<Buytoast> hell i'd probably give fallout a whirl if i got a copy for free or cheap or something
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy JFFS!
<SirGanjalf> Buytoast: What part did you bought
<SirGanjalf> ?
<otakon> and ANOTHER animation change
<Kencolt> Interestingly, (i just looked it up) Zin never MET any of the quest team in the original series-- not face to face. That didn't happen until "The New Adventures", and at the beginning of "The Real Adventures" he's thought to be dead-- but showed up again in Season 2.
<otakon> Wrek: how many animation styles did this show go through back then?
<Buytoast> i just bought it for 60 bucks when it came out
<Buytoast> i gave into the hype
<Wrek> 05otakon: i have no idea what you are talkign about
<otakon> yeah these two putz'
<SirGanjalf> Buytoast: You mean Fallout 3?
<pony_3045> SCIENCE
<Buytoast> no, skyrim
<jcelios> Zin strikes me as the kind of guy who never really dies
<otakon> Wrek: the animation, the character designs have changed
<Dark_Horst> ...did i just hear de lancie?
<SirGanjalf> ^eeyup
<alexxm> Dark_Horst yep
<Dark_Horst> duhuhude
<Wrek> 05all i notice is Dr Quest
<Wrek> 05otehr than that
<pony_3045> dr Venture
<Wrek> 05the only time it changes is qhen it shifts between questworld and the "real" world
<otakon> Wrek: Quest and the others, if you compare this to the "Spectre of the Pine Barens"
<LadyCanary> That's some...quest.

<Dark92Enigma> Wrek: points if you got the refere--- why should i bother, everypony knows
<Saturn> 08,01i don't suppose any of you have any experience writing JVM bytecode?
<Buytoast> depends
<J_E_Smith71> Hey Wrek the other day you told me not to talk about the comic if it has to do with the unaired episodes. However, M.A.Larson mentioned on his Twitter that he "knows nothing about the comic and is seperate from what we're doing". If the comic is a different continuity than the show, can we speak of the new issues a certain time after they go on sale(Not an arguement of the rules, just curious on how you'll stand with the comic)?
<Buytoast> what does JVM mean?
<Haku1013> nyeh
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: Java Virtual Machine
<Buytoast> is it anything like that beachhead game?
<Buytoast> cause i was good at that

<AttackWithHugs> Is the stream freezing for anyone, or is it just me?
<Dark92Enigma> Wrek: in case of spoiler-prones.....the castrator is on your right :D
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Canbakes.
<J_E_Smith71> Wrek: Though I'm trying to hear back from Katie Cook (the comic's writer) and see what she says about the issue of the comic and show being in different continuites
<prince-dari> Yeah, my stream is ded
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<LadyCanary> So is mine.
<trixie_squirtle> same
<Buytoast> it's frozen for me like a bag of green beans

<Buytoast> canned vegetables are sinful, wicked creations designed to pollute the masses
<prince-dari> NewDCD >:

<Haku1013> I dont like celery
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Onore DCD! :D jk

<AdamTheDuck> Ohey Ponies47!~
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma: I dunno, since the new eps have a rule where we have to wait a day after they air before we can talk about them, I'm checking to see if there's a time period between when the comic goes on sale and when we can talk about it here
<AttackWithHugs> I see no new YouTube layout. It looks the same to me
<cachi01> Ponies47: and no im not kidding

*Saturn 08,01realises that this explanation probably does not help
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: could be worse... i spent like six hours shotgunning what i thought was the simplest java in the world when i was learning
<Rose`> Saturn, im a medic who is barely qualified.
*otakon glomps Reikim
<Stormy> dude, don't you have a bank account?

<Kandarihu> Granted, I love anime.

<Spyrorocks> plus helps me build credit.
<SpeccyRush> otakon: you could say... a wet dream
<otakon> NewDCD: why do the Japanese love German so much?
<Kandarihu> Wrek, that is good news. Too bad we're just one of many, and it'll still be seen as a government that's just owned by the MPAA and accountable only to them.
<Adjeca> haha carring like a few hundred bucks here = you're a drug dealer = money confiscated/disappears
<otakon> damn
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah it was a dream i was like dafuq did that fire truck spawn outta nowhere?! :D

<thelonecubone> AJIsHaunter: ah, i thought she was in Highschool for some reason
<Stormy> I never see skylanders stuff here
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i tired i think..
<Stormy> apart from the toys and carrying cases
<trixie_squirtle> l2 multiply 4 by 3
<Kandarihu> In any case, even though the U.S. delegation is against it, we should prepare for contingencies for if this U.N. takeover actually does occur.
<thelonecubone> aniderp|bestcakeever: well, go to bread then :3
<Adjeca> hmm. tried walmart? that's where all this stuff i got is from
*AdamTheDuck throws bread at aniderp|bestcakeever :P
<Buytoast> we don't need no foreign powers regulating our internet
<Buytoast> we built it
<Stormy> And all the stores around here seem to have stopped selling the first game since giants came out
<aniderp|bestcakeever> nuuu
<Buytoast> we control it

<AdamTheDuck> Buytoast, fight dah powah?

<SpeccyRush> dat blunt thought
<prince-dari> Oh yeah I just remembered, my physics teacher said one of the 32 founders of the internet came and talked to him at school the other day.
<Stormy> could have something to do with it being a college town I guess
<sub06905> :D
<AJIsHaunter> Hamtaro. :O
<Rose`> and crispy too!
<AJIsHaunter> I LOVED that show.
<LadyCanary> Hamtaro :333
<thelonecubone> I imagen Buytoast on a philosoraptor with a murikan flag with him
<LadyCanary> Heke? :3
<Adjeca> maybe, and the type of walmart it might be
<Stormy> it's one of those superstores
<AJIsHaunter> The animation's pretty smooth.
<Stormy> it has the grocery section and stuff
<Buytoast> raptors aren't american
<Reikim> "philosoraptor"
<Buytoast> now triceratops
<Adjeca> i don't think the walmart near me is a high enough volume store
<Buytoast> those are america
<Reikim> A raptor with a degree in metaphysics?
<Kandarihu> Well we don't actually wield control of the internet. It's been doing fine in U.S. hands, and unless the government starts abusing that, it shouldn't change. The U.N. answers to dictatorships, so we don't want them running the internet.

<NewDCD> 09,01JoJo but this is fun too
<NewDCD> 09,01kind of refreshing

<NewDCD> 09,01Anime lately had been absolute crap
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgaY7b8ru4Q
<Stormy> People on 4chan thinking it was funny to like a girly show

*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol this SO reminds me of Akibaranger :D
<Spyrorocks> go offline for months.
<CCharmanderK> Kyoto Animation needs to do more action anime.
<CriticKitten> This is just glorious.
<CriticKitten> XD
<Kimori> oh :/
<AJIsHaunter> FIRE~
<CrystalPhoenix> oh japan and their cute girls fighting eachother
<otakon> and ofc announcing your attacks is in FULL SWING
<AJIsHaunter> :D
<otakon> lol
*DashWithRainbows slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<DashWithRainbows> >:l
<Buytoast> oh shit i can't stop laughing
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Stormy> I was also not the greatest mod at times
<DashWithRainbows> What you want, Joomay?
<CriticKitten> otakon: Rule of anime, announcing your attack's name makes it stronger.
<Jmo> Nothing.
<Kandarihu> I only started laughing when they started spinning.
*sonicdude558 slaps Jmo around a bit with a fursuit
<otakon> CriticKitten: eeyup
<Stormy> SF started to get a reputation for being to strict
<Jmo> ...

<DashWithRainbows> Cause trouble for the establishment and all that
<Stormy> and the whole Razz thing
<otakon> ngiht sonicdude558 sleep well
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, I think the idea is that any attack that's special in any way has a name to it, and it's proper to announce the name as the attack is being used.
<sonicdude558> Sorry about the fursuit thing
<CCharmanderK> FORESHADOWING *Inception DUUUUN sound*
<otakon> and inb4 Shinka is a secret Chuu
*sonicdude558 *Slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout

<Filly_Lightstar> :|
<otakon> well a three
<jcelios> 1/6*
<otakon> so 2/1
*RDash5000 gives Filly_Lightstar an apple to make them stop talking.
<otakon> 4/12
<trixie_squirtle> jcelios: i think she means rolling 3 with both dice
<Shammy> she has a gun...wut
<otakon> or 1/4
*Filly_Lightstar takes apple
<otakon> I think?
<trixie_squirtle> otakon: no
<RDash5000> :D
*Filly_Lightstar reads book somemore
<otakon> trixie_squirtle: okay than what ARE the odds of rolling a 3 with two dice?
<CCharmanderK> Rikka really needs to stop being so damn adorable.
<RoboGerbil> youre assuming they use a 6 sided dice
<trixie_squirtle> otakon: unless.. idk what they meant, i though 2 with both
<jcelios> its 1/12
<trixie_squirtle> *3
<otakon> RoboGerbil: well what would they use?
<Buytoast> don't you make a valid argument
<Buytoast> those are terrible
<CrystalPhoenix> lawl OOC
<CriticKitten> No it's not. >_>
<RoboGerbil> otakon: i dunno, d10, d100? lol
<otakon> RoboGerbil: that's not a standard die
<Dark92Enigma> OOC IS CANON
<Filly_Lightstar> i would like some tea
<otakon> OOC?
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<RoboGerbil> otakon: depends on what game you play
<Unnr> otakon, d10 and d1000 are both sandard die
<CriticKitten> It's 1/6 * 1/6. You measure each probability independently and multiply to combine their possibilities. :p
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: Out Of Character
<otakon> RoboGerbil: it's a math question
<superretroworld> jcelios: theres another 3, so wouldnt that be 2/12?
*Unnr loves the D-golfball
<otakon> ah
<AJIsHaunter> !
<CrystalPhoenix> dat ringtone
<trixie_squirtle> CriticKitten: well thats what i thought but thats if they meant rolling 3 with both, unless they mean rolling a sum of 3

<CCharmanderK> Touka is freaking sexy. It's the eyes.

<otakon> she's alone on the weekends
<RDash5000> goodnight guys :)
<otakon> NewDCD: so a one and a two right?
<trixie_squirtle> then that would be 2/36
*Filly_Lightstar reads book about flying
<CriticKitten> Then you'd need to account for all possibilities that equal 3.
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah
<AJIsHaunter> Night, RDash5000. :)
<Dark92Enigma> Goodnight RDash5000
*Sketch_Toku_Brony hands AJIsHaunter cardboard box "Take care of your box,and it'll take care of you..." :D
<otakon> trixie_squirtle: simplify it, 1/18

<CrystalPhoenix> sorry shizuka
<Ponies47> :3
<HoodEvee> SHE'S BEEN IN THE WOODS
<HoodEvee> OF COURSE SHES COLD
<the_real_pony_1604> the ads on ustream wouldn't but me so much if they wernt so freaking loud
<Shizuka> 13nope
<RoboGerbil> CrystalPhoenix: nope, cuz it explains the circumstances
<Shizuka> 13more importantly she touched the wall
<thelonecubone> the_real_pony_1604: i know that feel, get adblock
<HoodEvee> DRAMATIC MUSIC
<Barbetos> It had drawings of pony.
<trixie_squirtle> lol and they they were stranded
<the_real_pony_1604> I have adblock, thats the thing
<Barbetos> She could not help but touch.
<CriticKitten> "Did you touch the wall?" Yes, the well wasn't exactly HUGE or anything, lady, and I had to touch it to climb up
<trixie_squirtle> *then
<thelonecubone> the_real_pony_1604: uh, weird
<Shizuka> 13the city walls
<CriticKitten> Oh?
<Buytoast> walls are evil
<Buytoast> adn dangerous
<the_real_pony_1604> I can never seem to block the ads on ustream
<Shizuka> 13you can't trust walls
<Shizuka> 13or wheels
<trixie_squirtle> do not touch the wall! http://puu.sh/1cLIV
<Buytoast> the letter w is the puppet master it seems
<HoodEvee> Buytoast: Walls seperate us from the ponies. Without them, we would be invaded
<CriticKitten> Naw, walls aren't dangerous. It's not the walls, it's the railings on top of the walls.
<Buytoast> which means
<Datcord> HoodEvee: I wouldn't mind hat...
<Buytoast> seseme street is the herald of darkness
<CriticKitten> Because the height + the fact that railings are there DRAMATICALLY increase the odds of a railing death
<Dark92Enigma> put the WHEELS AGAINST THE WALL!!!!!!
<RoboGerbil> but the next one i plan on reading after a bluebirds song will be Tales from Mystika
<HoodEvee> Datcord: You would when it happens

<SpeccyRush> and now we know where that musics from, if you didn't already
<Kencolt> The horrifying thing, is Haruhi is EXCEPTING a urder or a monster and whatnot-- without concern to any possible consequences.

<Kimori> haha
<Shizuka> 13it's the murder mystery ep
<AJIsHaunter> Ah, I see.
<AJIsHaunter> I've seen little of this, so this should be interesting.
<Shizuka> 13sadly i think the epic gaming episode is the very last one
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, I'm pretty sure it's the episode about the downtime that's at the end.
<Shizuka> 13EYY CUZZIN WANT TO GO SHOOT POOL
<the_real_pony_1604> it is, and I still want to know if anyone made that game IRL. bronys would have about 4 versions by now
<AJIsHaunter> I meant to say murder instead of the strange twist in order of accidently saying spoilers.
<Kandarihu> I need to redownload this series so I can go over it again.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Is Majong usualy this dramatic?
<Barbetos> Well.
<Shizuka> 13SpadeKyurem[R]: very

<Kandarihu> You know what? My first experience of Hare Hare Yukai was this weird flash that crossed this with a really bad series called "Musashi Gun-Doh" and it was HILLARIOUS!
<Buytoast> like little hard cakes
<thelonecubone> wasnt there a Comic book similar to this?
<Kimori> are all those websites safe?
<AJIsHaunter> Oh, I've heard this anime through people talking about it. How is it?
<Stormy> Probably not
<Kimori> ._.
<Shizuka> 13mahjong is srs bns
<Stormy> They're on the map based on the amount of traffic they get
<Tovler> a fat girl in an anime?
<Kencolt> OK. I knew that Japan had manga about playing Mah-jonng, action manga even. An anime was unexpected. Then again...
<Barbetos> I can't look away
<Shammy> bns of seriousness Shammy
<Barbetos> And I never knew it was... something like this before
<Stormy> probably a lot of bad stuff gets on there
<Shammy> Shizuka.....i freaking derped on my on name

<Barbetos> Time to make an anime about poker!
<Barbetos> Texas hold em!
<AJIsHaunter> Barbetos: inb4 there already is one XD
<Stormy> heh, I haven't either
<Barbetos> Eyeshield 21 or wahtever
<Barbetos> that is all I have to say
<Stormy> at least nothing that's obviously porn from looking at the url
<Kencolt> AJIsHaunter: Well, it's more likely that there's a manga. If it's really successful, then...
<Kandarihu> Barbetos, that series is about American Football.
<AJIsHaunter> .....
<AJIsHaunter> Um, what was that? :S
<texasboykc09> AJIsHaunter: what
<AJIsHaunter> texasboykc09: Mmm, never mind. I just thought I saw something weird.

<CCharmanderK> -_- I'm interested in the series now, but I don't wanna spoil it, so I'll bow out for now.
<Stormy> I had like 3 months of it last time I applied
<Kimori> Ive got close to 5 years
<Stormy> they always send an email that's like "we do not currently have a position for you at this time"
<Amu-chan> One year for me, and the only reason I left the place I was working was because of relocating.
<trixie_sprinkle> wait wut
<trixie_sprinkle> they can do that? lul
<Shizuka> 13yeah.. if you recall the start of the series, growing the wings isn't exactly painless
<Shizuka> 13reki's introduction to the world wasn't very pleasant
<Kimori> I'm sure youl be fine
<Kimori> I remember my first interview, I was freaking out
<Kimori> it was minimum wage, but cant complain since it was my first job :P
<Stormy> I've actually gotten really good at interviews
<Stormy> My first one was awful though :P
*AdamTheDuck licks Jaymoo :3

<texasboykc09> "this world is filled with idiots" true statement
<trixie_sprinkle> meh, not a fan of that statement
<trixie_sprinkle> it always revolves around the assumption "i'm not one of them"
<Shizuka> 13not always
<Shizuka> 13more like
<Shizuka> 13"the world is filled with idiots"
<Shizuka> 13"some of us are slightly less idiot"

<Shizuka> 13many people think they're above average

<geeky-egg> HoodEvee: chat needs more eggs
<HoodEvee> Japanime
<Polydunami> Well, I know that Rule 36 exists. But still, I don't think even a teenage boy ought to be embarrassed by a doll.
<geeky-egg> Polydunami: wut
<Polydunami> Bah. It's no big deal.
<Polydunami> Also, I know who Data is.
<trixie_sprinkle> should i ask what rule 36 is
<Shizuka> 13well in his defense, like he said he forgot they were dolls, given how used he is to them running around
<geeky-egg> trixie_sprinkle: porn
<Shizuka> 13r36 is "if it exists, there is a fetish of it"
<AdamTheDuck> trixie_sprinkle, not sure the exact wording, but it's just there's a opposite sex variation of everything
<trixie_sprinkle> heh, ok
<HoodEvee> ._.
<Shizuka> 13that's 63
<geeky-egg> trixie_sprinkle: its porn that kills your chiled hood

<Spyrorocks[Air]> http://www.polarpiece.com/en/
<geeky-egg> trixie_sprinkle: porn
<Spyrorocks[Air]> that screams canadian
<Shizuka> 1334 is "if it exists, there is porn of it", 35 is "if porn of it doesn't exist, it will be immediately created", and 36 is "if it exists, it is someone's fetish"
<Polydunami> Wait, can she move her toes as well?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> for some reason.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> why do i want one though.
<HoodEvee> Polydunami: Well, seeing as she's a magic fucking doll, sure why not?
<trixie_sprinkle> all dem porn rules, although its the internet, so it makes sense
<Stormy> Looks like snuggies
<Polydunami> Okay, thanks for the kind answer.
<Shizuka> 13eesh nori keep that stuff in your d... i guess they are in your dreams bust still eeeeeesh...
<HoodEvee> Polydunami: Sorry, not trying to be rude :S
<Polydunami> No worries, I can sympatize :$
*trixie_sprinkle slaps hoodini around a bit with a large cow
<Stormy> why are they so expensive? XD
<Spyrorocks[Air]> its definitely not a snuggie
<HoodEvee> Hoodini?
<HoodEvee> That's new
<Spyrorocks[Air]> probably because they are not made overseas.
<HoodEvee> Hey that's my milk cow!
<trixie_sprinkle> not anymore
<Shizuka> 13shinku figures she isn't going to make it through the duel, thus the sudden niceness
<Polydunami> Wait, sayonara?
<NocturnalBlade> daaaaw she as a soft side ^_^
*geeky-egg slaps trixie_sprinkle a bit with a larg eg
<Spyrorocks[Air]> it looks so much cooler than a snuggie.
<Stormy> Sweatpants, $59
*trixie_sprinkle boils the large egg, then eats it
<Stormy> I mean really
<Spyrorocks[Air]> besides basically being a onesie that babies wear.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> :P
<geeky-egg> trixie_sprinkle: your welcome
*HoodEvee slaps geeky-egg around a bit with a sharp sword
<Spyrorocks[Air]> im not a fan of sweatpants, i wear jeans all year around.
<trixie_sprinkle> i hope its not cloud's sword, that would be some painful slapping
<Stormy> I never used to wear them
<Stormy> then I went to college
*geeky-egg slaps HoodEvee a bit with large morningstar
<HoodEvee> A full scale metal replica of that sword weighs over 80 lbs
<HoodEvee> :I
<Shizuka> 13is it the one with the baby swords in it?
<trixie_sprinkle> so i guess theyll come just in time to save her during the duel i guess
<HoodEvee> Yes
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: ARCHETYPES
<trixie_sprinkle> i actually meant the buster sword one
<Polydunami> Up next, Spongebob?
<Polydunami> Or Bill Nye?
<trixie_sprinkle> the the one with miniswords was also wide
<trixie_sprinkle> Polydunami: out of bill nye unfortunately
<Spyrorocks[Air]> they tried to get an investment on dragons den and got rejected
<Polydunami> Wait, we finished the entire series?
<geeky-egg> SPONGEABUBLE

<HoodEvee> ._.

<NocturnalBlade> His leg!
<Shizuka> 13LIE MEH!
<geeky-egg> trixie_sprinkle leg

<Polydunami> Spongebob is being reasonable?
<geeky-egg> trixie_sprinkle: i wold do that if knew who was going to sit there next
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: was it hard to wash off?
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: Without any washing materials, yes
<trixie_sprinkle> cuz i remember scrubbing gum off my pants in high school, it took a long time and i couldnt walk around with gum on my butt
<trixie_sprinkle> and we had school uniform too
<geeky-egg> i hate uniforms

<Stormy> lol
<HoodEvee> Panda: They're both repetitive to a degree
<Spyrorocks[Air]> LOL captcha, how relevant. "snow shovel"

<trixie_sprinkle> wow isnt really that repetetive
<Panda> it kinda is XD

<Spyrorocks[Air]> hovering around 5-8C
<Panda> LoL is pretty much all pvp
<donutpop365> Shizuka: WHEEERE's THE BALLOOOOOOOOOOOOON PARTY?
<trixie_sprinkle> different players play differently, different tactics, different gear, different builds
<sub06905> national free balloon day
<sub06905> :I
<trixie_sprinkle> moba games are 1 map
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: I can't tell wich game your talking about now
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: well seeing how LoL doesnt have builds, and the general pvp tactics are always the same
<sub06905> ....
<sub06905> fire
<sub06905> lel
<geeky-egg> sub06905: fire needs more eggs
<sub06905> :D

<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: So, just the builds are different
<geeky-egg> ja bans and tahs
<sub06905> :D
<sub06905> lel
<geeky-egg> ok
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: a lot more items too, +professions, different enchantments
<HoodEvee> Its more about the competitive aspect :I
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: and each class has like 20-30 spells, contrary to moba games where there are only 4 spells per character
<geeky-egg> evil
<Shizuka> 13RECTANGLES!
<HoodEvee> If you play wow for the pvp, somethings wrong with you
<trixie_sprinkle> hardly, the pvp is very good there
<HoodEvee> You could just go buy gw2 if you want rpg pvp
<trixie_sprinkle> or at least it used to be, idk how it is now
<geeky-egg> he thinks he eat it now
<HoodEvee> I never liked this joke
<geeky-egg> HoodEvee: ok
<trixie_sprinkle> WoW is considered the best mmorpg, why would i want to play gw
<geeky-egg> trixie_sprinkle: i have nver played WoW and i dont want to
<trixie_sprinkle> but in any case, wow has much more variety than LoL
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: Mkay, I'm done here
<Panda> Thats not chocolate.
<geeky-egg> night HoodEvee
<HoodEvee> geeky-egg: I meant speaking ._.
<geeky-egg> HoodEvee: ok
<trixie_sprinkle> well ive not played gw HoodEvee , maybe the pvp is better there. but its certainly good in WoW too, and its better than moba games
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hm
<sub06905> moar fire
<Panda> trixie_sprinkle: >.> i didnt mean to start an arguement.
*geeky-egg pokes HoodEvee with a stick thats on fire

<AdamTheDuck> Maybe on a rainy day I might think of one geeky-egg :P
<geeky-egg> Panda: aduption
<Panda> HoodEvee, crabs would not pay for adoption.
<geeky-egg> AdamTheDuck: yah
<Shizuka> 13given pearl's crying habit
<Shizuka> 13i bet he didn't have to pay
<HoodEvee> Panda: Orphan
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: there are skills you use in battle, that could be said for any rpg game dueling
<Panda> That is a good point Shizuka.
<HoodEvee> Homeless orphan*
<sub06905> abduction then
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: Yeah, but all the mechanics are basically the same
<geeky-egg> batman
<geeky-egg> AFK
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: like what? skills having cooldowns is the same fr any rpg, other than that whats the same
<HoodEvee> Ganking, combat roles, timing, ect
<Panda> inb4 squeak driven insanity
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: again thats the same for any rpg as there are different classes
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: You just said they were the same
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: only the fact there are different combat roles and that skills have a cool down, its rpg. there are actually no combat roles 1v1
<oni_link> Aww, did I miss the fries part?
<Shizuka> 13THE TELL TALE SQUEAK

<HoodEvee> Hey oni_link

<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: actually thats 20-30 skills and 20-30 spells
<AJIsHaunter> ...
<AJIsHaunter> Wut?
<HoodEvee> The only fucking thing you serve, dumbass
<geeky-egg> AJIsHaunter: is dead may he rest in peacs

<HoodEvee> :I
<Yamahawk> HoodEvee: "Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is the beating of his hideous heart!"
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: and different races with different racial spells
<oni_link> The Tell Tale heart?
<Yamahawk> Yes
<oni_link> awesome
<trixie_sprinkle> the deed is done
<geeky-egg> wut
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: Not hot at all
<AJIsHaunter> Why not, Spongebob?
<oni_link> I love hidden mature context in kid shows
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: why, theres a lot of various combinations and variety, why is it bad
<geeky-egg> oni_link: me to
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: Oh, I never said it was bad
<oni_link> geeky-egg: exactly why I love this show :3
<AJIsHaunter> inb4 one of Patrick's greatest lines.
<HoodEvee> Just that WoW isn't about PvP
<oni_link> Imaaaaagggginaaaaaaatttttttiiiooooooonnnnn
<turtlegod98> In a few hours I have a business test and I need some inspiration.
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: thats for every player to decide, and the pvp there is good, and just fun. the fact that theres other things to do there makes it even better
<AdamTheDuck> Hahaha, I remember this episode, loved this one
<oni_link> turtlegod98: youre freakin turtlegod98

<oni_link> lol
<geeky-egg> oni_link: i cant spell
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: They're basically the same pvp wise, and lol is more competitive and team based, and they added new game modes. Also, as far as variety goes, there's about 30-40 different heroes with different skill sets, stats, and roles, and each counteracts eachother
<Moopy> Heh derpy
<oni_link> Excelsior?
<HoodEvee> I'm jus sayin
<Yamahawk> HoodEvee: 30-40 heroes? There are over 100
<HoodEvee> Yamahawk: I be a newb

<HoodEvee> ananaANAI
<oni_link> didnt they choose funny words when you think about it? LoL and WoW
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: but every character has only 4 spells, and the tactics are always the same. it mostly comes down to choosing the right items depending on your enemies, you get no say in the matter, you Have to choose the fitting items, otherwise youll lose
<geeky-egg> thats me on a staerday
<oni_link> lol and LoL are two different things
<oni_link> funny to me
<HoodEvee> trixie_sprinkle: Alot more skill than you would think

<turtlegod98> lol
<geeky-egg> oni_link: he he
<oni_link> I made a funny :p
<trixie_sprinkle> HoodEvee: it takes some skill of course, but it has no variety because you Need to choose specific items for enemies, if you dont choose the right items youll lose
<Shizuka> 13i love how the launch sounds like someone making the effect

<AdamTheDuck> Bye donutpop365
<donutpop365> Dangit < 2 hours of sleep :(
<donutpop365> Anyways, ciao *Huggles Every Single One of Ya*
<naturesfury> shotguns. SuperBrony64 nemisis
<VioletGreySha> CoD~ most useless game since years~
<naturesfury> what i like about battlefienld over this is that in bf it actaly takes more than 2 bullets to kill you :/ no offense
<VioletGreySha> well yah
<VioletGreySha> cod is like no soldier is wearing some protection~
<AdamTheDuck> It takes 4-5 bullets, not much different from CoD .-.
<VioletGreySha> indeed
<VioletGreySha> but you dont instatly die from a shotgun shoot in the knee
<naturesfury> oi those extra bullets mean ALOT
<VioletGreySha> not with mps
<AdamTheDuck> I usually play hardcore in BF3 anyway >.>, 3 bullets kill \o/
<VioletGreySha> CoD is a MP only game~
<naturesfury> god i wish there was games w/o planes and helis though. they outright break the game sometimes
<VioletGreySha> yah
<VioletGreySha> lvl 100 jet flyers
<AdamTheDuck> Or hop over to Red Orchestra 2 and a rifleman can kill in a single shot up to ~250m away \o/
<VioletGreySha> instantly rape everything
<Vivix> RO2 is unforgiving
<VioletGreySha> indeed
<AdamTheDuck> <3 RO2
<VioletGreySha> thats why its epic
<XAX> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354768767313.gif Jesus christ, how horrifying.
<Vivix> It is pretty fun, I haven't played it in ages though
<naturesfury> god those proxy mines are op
<Sumica> 00,10the name seems correct
<Sumica> 00,10who ever has it dies alot
<VioletGreySha> Cod4 was the only great CoD in multiplayer for me~
<naturesfury> aliens are officaly inside the phoens
<AdamTheDuck> All those mines .-.
<VioletGreySha> ofc
<VioletGreySha> its like mw3~
<VioletGreySha> thats why i love cod4, cause nobody got heavy overpowerd stuff like this mines
<naturesfury> sb sure dose love his handguns
<XAX> Black ops 2 is great. You just prone if you hear a jumping jimmy go off.
<AdamTheDuck> I seriously wonder if anyone would hold a knife like that
<naturesfury> i bet that knife felt good for sb
<XAX> Wait, is BO2 on stream?
<naturesfury> AdamTheDuck: solid snake?
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 STAHP
<MadSurge> XAX: SuperBrony64 stream! :)
<XAX> MadSurge: So it is?
<MadSurge> Ayup
<VioletGreySha> iam so happy that i dont waste money on CoD anymore~ i dont pay 60 for the same game every year~
*AdamTheDuck stopped at CoD 2 :P
<MadSurge> VioletGreySha: :D/)
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh the first few CoD's were classics
<VioletGreySha> ^^
<XAX> Black ops 2 is $120 on release here. Fucking new zealand, and it's ripoff game prices.
<AdamTheDuck> XAX, wat.
<MadSurge> GOD WHAT
<XAX> I just bought a key for $60 and activated it on steam though.
<MadSurge> XAX: :D
<XAX> Because fuck paying $100 like my consolefag friends do.
<VioletGreySha> well as i said, everything affter CoD4 in multiplayer is just damn ripoff~ they suck this series dry for money~
<AdamTheDuck> Oh that's right
<AdamTheDuck> Console still has to buy CD's XD
<AdamTheDuck> <3 his PC XD
*AdamTheDuck <3 his PC XD*
<XAX> CoD is mindless fun. Also, I haven't bought a single CoD since 4 either. MW3 and BO were gifted to me. Dad bought the key for BO2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<VioletGreySha> i always say, people that play shooters on consoles are to bad to get a good pc~
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You can download most of the Wii U games off the eShop should you choose
<XAX> SuperBrony64: >tfw I still owe you $20 for BO
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guess what time it is
<naturesfury> tool time?
<AdamTheDuck> Adventure Time? :3
<naturesfury> dinner time im rely gonna gess though
<VioletGreySha> XAX; sure cod is mindles fun but then get Sirious sam 3 and get even more mindless fun XD
<XAX> I got the original second one.

<Moopy> I wasn't wasteing money dude
<Jmo> Holy shit needs more tilde.
*Vivix loves tilde~~
<naturesfury> :'(
<XAX> Needs more console key.
<Vivix> |

<taoumi> HURG twitter lag
<Moopy> Uh huh sure whatever dude
<incog> yes, hello

<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i dont get why homophobia exists :I
<JRP2234> guys
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guys are trying to get me bi :\
<JRP2234> critisize
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Me neither. It's a stupid thing to worry about. =/
<JRP2234> night SuperBrony64
<Vivix> It can sometimes be explained by things like- "Does that lingering touch mean anything? What does he think about me?" etc
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: same here.....why?
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: the only reason gay marriage is illegal is cause people think it is gross...
<Bronysith> WHY?!
<MadSurge> aniderp|bestcakeever: why? Which gender do you like?
<Bronysith> HOW IS LOVE GROSS?!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> female
<aniderp|bestcakeever> when i thought i was bi i still preferred female..
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, you realize that's a hateful term, right?
<Bronysith> Love is between a man and a woman...or a man and a man, or a woman and a man, i really dont give a shit
<MadSurge> aniderp|bestcakeever: fine for me! I like girls too :D
<Bronysith> or a woman and a woman
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im a girl :P
<Vivix> Love is love, across all borders except the dangerous
<aniderp|bestcakeever> or woman.. whatever you put it im 20
<Bronysith> Vivix: you mean child love?
<Vivix> as a dangerous thing yes
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Because love between the same gender isn't natural, and people are scared of what isn't natural. Which is stupid because it's also harmless.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> am i considered a woman?
<Vivix> it's bad for a growing mind- but love exists in many places
<aniderp|bestcakeever> or a girl?
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: seriously, also people now assosiate gay with bad....wtf?
<Vivix> Objectum Sexuality, zoophilia, homosexuality, bisexuality-
<JRP2234> http://fav.me/d5k5azm guys please critisize
<JRP2234> i need some
<Dark92Enigma> aniderp|bestcakeever: depends of the age
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im 20
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: hehehe, not natural? There's plenty of gay sex between animals :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bronysith: Good chunk of people reason it with what they believe the bible considers it as a sin.
<Bronysith> Vivix: i am more on the pansexual side, as longa s one day i find someone to love, being man or woman, i dont care, as long as i have someone to comfort me or me to comfort them
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: News to me. :P
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: inserted during translation
<Vivix> Bronysith, yeah~~ s a good lock
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, I don't think it counts as sex, though.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64!!!!!!!!!!!! GTFO AND SLEEP
<JRP2234> NOW
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02NO U
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: sightings of male lions duking it out counts? :D
<Ponies47> To school I go
<Ponies47> Bye~
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Later Ponies47, have an awesome birthday :D
<Bronysith> that whole "Homosexuality is a sin" was easily put in during translation
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i dare not tell my grandmother on my father's side
<aniderp|bestcakeever> she would flip..
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: "duking it out" means they were fighting, not fucking. :D
<Ponies47> Thanks SuperBrony64|Zzz it's already been really good so far :3
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: nevertheless, it's a stupid thing to hate :D
<Bronysith> theres lost in translation, mistranslated, and of course, just fucking made up
<JRP2234> night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: you not homophobic right?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> my brother said he would come to my wedding if i got married
<aniderp|bestcakeever> isnt that special?
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Nope.
<Bronysith> good
<Vivix> Is good, yeah
<Bronysith> well im off to class
*Bronysith grabs Vivix
<MadSurge> aniderp|bestcakeever: aww your bro is nice :)
<Bronysith> AWAY
*Vivix screams
<MadSurge> Later Bronysith!
*Vivix has an adventure
<aniderp|bestcakeever> he doesnt care who i love he just wants to see me happy i guess
<Dark92Enigma> aniderp|bestcakeever: so you do have a BBBFF
<Gold_Demona> And my husband's not an OMG RAGE homophobe. If he is, he keeps it pretty quiet.
<Jmo> o_O
<Vivix> many people can be homophobic without being against it
<Vivix> like- my father said he was scared of homosexuals, because whenever someone came out to him ,it was to hit on him
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: wut?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> well we dont talk much.. but he does come home for holidays like chirstmas
<Kandarihu> Vivix, and yet there's such a witchhunt against anyone who doesn't endorse the lifestyle.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im like a hermit in my room :\
<Dark92Enigma> aniderp|bestcakeever: just like certain white unicorn
<Vivix> There's people on both sides who are way too serious about it
<Gold_Demona> That's true with any argument, really
<Vivix> yeah~ people should be allowed to live their life, as long as noone is being harmed, but even that is not a simple rule
<Gold_Demona> I like to try and hang out in the middle. There's more understanding there.
<Vivix> I try, but I fail sometimes
<Rose`Garden> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/12/3/9rISnJOulU6AsKifMrFExg2.jpg
<Gold_Demona> I like to think I succeed for the most part. It's mostly because I hate to see people fight. =(
<Jmo> You always fail Vivix.
<Kandarihu> Rose`Garden, lawl
*Vivix hugs Jmo
<Gold_Demona> I also hate choosing sides...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dont you people think im sweet and nice? :>
<Gold_Demona> Or choosing in general...
<JRP2234|Zzz> kjadsjaskldsjalkjdskaljsda
<Gold_Demona> Choices suck.
<Vivix> I do, in general, hate fighting- but I like discussing, and sometimes I say stupid things if I get cought up in something I believe in
<Vivix> always regret it later
<aniderp|bestcakeever> how will i become famous?
<Vivix> Be swedish, and play horror games
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im american xD
<Havok> murrica
<Ninjazz> Ew. I know who you're referencing.
<Jmo> God no Vivix.
<Vivix> buy a knitted sweater, and practice a swedish accent
<Jmo> I want to hurt you.
<Vivix> hehe
<Jmo> Holy shit it's Ninjazz
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im not pewdie or marzia
<Ninjazz> Jaymeow.
<Ninjazz> I mean, jaymeow!
<MadSurge> :O Ninjazz!
<Havok> Vivixz, I'm swedish and I play horror games, I'm not famous ;~;
<Vivix> Aww..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i already have enough trouble with english xD
<Vivix> Jag er inte sjuk, inte sjuk, jag är bara sveeensk
<Ninjazz> Surge!
<Havok> *Jag är
<Havok> :3
<Kandarihu> The thing is, any comment that goes outside of accepted norms on homosexuality gets blown way out of proportion. Like what happened with Chik-Fil-A
<Vivix> <,<
<Gold_Demona> I'm liking the cozy fire in the stream. :>
<Dark92Enigma> Gold_Demona: we're still in Bronysith's bed, right?
<Vivix> my swedish is horrible
<Dark92Enigma> don't SK ME

<Meanwhile> We cause the downpour.
<Jmo> MAKE IT RAIN.
<Meanwhile> We drop the water.
<Jmo> <:
<Ninjazz> Cause a monsoon.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Goddamn rappers
<JRP2234|Zzz> GOTO BED
<Meanwhile> We persuade air liquid to follow gravity.

*AssaultWithEmbraces wonders if anyone really knows what that phrase means
<Meanwhile> Motherfucker you can never have any Milky Milk.
<Jmo> I'll shank you and shag your couch.
<Barbetos> I resent that
<Meanwhile> Engaging my couch in coitus won't get you any closer to the Milky Cave.
<Jmo> Maybe your couch is covering the Milky Cave.
<Meanwhile> It isn't.
<Jmo> Don't lie.
<Meanwhile> Nou.
<Barbetos> Meanwhile hates me
<Jmo> Your couch will tell me the truth.
<Barbetos> He would never milky,,

<Meanwhile> My couch is a whore.
<MadSurge> I made Meanwhile mad :D
<Jmo> I'd know that.
<Jmo> Quite well
<Meanwhile> Implying I have to be mad to take the piss out of you.
<Barbetos> Meanwhile does not get angry. He merely corrects your bad grammer.
<Meanwhile> grammar*
<Barbetos> see
<Barbetos> Works everytime
*AssaultWithEmbraces acts like an annoying child
<Barbetos> I will put you in the box again.
<Meanwhile> What else is new.
<Barbetos> The box.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> What box?
<Ninjazz> Someone needs some corporal punishment.
*Jmo slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
<Barbetos> TEH. Box.
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: the baby box :D
<Ninjazz> Jaymeow's got the right idea. Just the wrong target.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I didn't come in a box.

<Ninjazz> My passport doesn't say Bronystate.
<Barbetos> This is going to take a while. FOP FOM FOOO
*AssaultWithEmbraces forgot what she was going to say
<Barbetos> WHO HA HA FOP FOM FOO
<Barbetos> was that it?
<Sylandest> I thought the song of Bronystate was "HUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUE"
<Barbetos> There are many songs

<Meanwhile> I probably would.
<Sylandest> I think many of us would be tempted to
<Barbetos> I could never see Meanwhile in a pink outfit like that though.
<Barbetos> I am sure he would against rainbow horse.
<Meanwhile> It's not pink but close enough? http://i.imgur.com/X3Gow.jpg

<Barbetos> Damnit
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, but still fun.
<Barbetos> My coffee is ruined.
<Ninjazz> YOU FAILED.
<Barbetos> Now I want a proper cup of tea.
*AssaultWithEmbraces throws popcorn in the air
<Barbetos> And that is the only reason my coffee is ruined. It brewed great.
<Ninjazz> It's ruined because you wanted some tea?
<Barbetos> I could just maul Jmo to death for that! =D
<MadSurge> Perfect vengeance! :D
<Sylandest> and thus, peace was made
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Can we like, stop trying to kill each other?
<Ninjazz> That's no fun.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Not without a guillotine
<Barbetos> Hmmm... << Hrmmm.... >>

<Sylandest> but, but...myuh...
<Jmo> That's what I thought.
*AssaultWithEmbraces doesn't even anymore
<Jmo> <:
<Meanwhile> You know, capslock can be rearranged into cockslap
<Jmo> I can now sleep at night knowing that, thank you.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> no. just....no
<Sylandest> my brain exploded upon realizing that
<Ninjazz> And boobytrap spelled backwords spells partyboob.
<Meanwhile> backwards*
<Jmo> Not the only thing that exploded.
<Jmo> HOHOHO
<Sylandest> oh you
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/961886831f62396feab092979ff637c7.png Oh my, a true unicorn!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: Needs more pink
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: :D
<Sylandest> and hearts
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And balloons
<Sylandest> never go wrong with hearts
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And bouncy pink hair
<Dark_Horst> oh look, the cleansing power of fire
<Jmo> And blood.
<Jmo> Everywhere.
<Jmo> :>
<Sylandest> you're adorable, jaymoo
<Jmo> I know right.
<Sylandest> <3
<Jmo> o u <3
<Sylandest> \:3/
<Jmo> You just lost it all making that face.
<Jmo> I hope you are happy.
<Dark_Horst> videokamin.de.... so there's a whole site with the sole purpose of filming chimney fires
<Dark_Horst> huh
<Hoody|Skool> Oh, bg fire
<Hoody|Skool> Eyo ponies
<Sylandest> Jmo: I ish happeh
<MadSurge> Hey Hoody|Skool!
<Dark92Enigma> that fire absolutely works......it keeps me warm to my hooves
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Hoody|Skool
<Hoody|Skool> Technically Shizu never stopped streaming
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/308b0ebad95f9dfa57b8662ff7185816.jpg <3
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Awww, Pinkie <3
<Hoody|Skool> HNNG
*Hoody|Skool dies
*MadSurge revives Hoody|Skool
*Hoody|Skool sings I will survive
<Sylandest> Time to go to class
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Pinkie makes everything instantly better (when she's not wreaking havoc)
<Sylandest> laters all
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye Sylandest.
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: Ikr :D
<Hoody|Skool> latas Sylandest
<Dark_Horst> now imagine that picture with fluttershy
<Jmo> Bai Syl
<Sylandest> bai bai
<Dark_Horst> was nice knowing ya
<Sylandest> Dark_Horst: That picture with fluttershy, but drinking a milkshake as well as a filly
<Dark_Horst> and that's how you kill a man with his own mind
<Sylandest> :>
<Hoody|Skool> Shoulda stayed home today :S
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You okay, Hoody|Skool?
<Hoody|Skool> Don't feel good
<Jmo> Poor diddums.
<VenHur> Hello, everypony! ...Which one of you stole the popcorn?
*Gold_Demona munches on something... suspicious. >_>
<Gold_Demona> What popcorn? <_<
*Jmo slaps Gold_Demona around a bit with a large trout
*Gold_Demona slaps Jmo around a bit with a large banana
<VenHur> That what's he gets for stealing MY popcorn!
<Gold_Demona> he?
<Meanwhile> Undefined.
<Gold_Demona> he who?
<Jmo> Your mother is a slag Meanwhile.
<Dark_Horst> yer mom's a slag
<Meanwhile> Nuh-uh Mayjoo, yer ma is the slag.
<Gold_Demona> Are you startin', Mojay? >.>
<Jmo> I don't start till I hit the bedroom.
<Jmo> Success.
<VenHur> I like the sideshow...but atlas, with an more powerful stream that never lags, we lays the buffer show to eternal rest.
<Jmo> wut
<Jmo> Meanwhile, can you understand that?
<Meanwhile> I don't think that was actually a sentence.
<Jmo> Neither do I.
<MadSurge> I do, but there's tons of errors :D
<VenHur> Ugh, it's fancy saying for R.I.P Buffer Show.
<MadSurge> ^
<Jmo> Fancy?
<VenHur> You silly intelligence amuses me, silly ponies!
<Meanwhile> It was like...you put a lot of words onto little strips of paper, then threw them everywhere and read them off as you picked them up again.
<MadSurge> *alas *a
<MadSurge> *lay
<VenHur> I'm not the perfect spelling bee, okay? =C
<MadSurge> Poor VenHur
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I miss the buffer show. we never found out if The Duke of Veemi actually went with Lady Mips.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Right, MadSurge?
<MadSurge> :D
<Meanwhile> Turns out Lady Mips was banging her brother and they had an ugly child who became king.
*Hoody|Skool pokes Meanwhile
<Gold_Demona> Meanwhile: Was his name Livestream?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> The scandals that followed!
<Meanwhile> Yes, yes it was.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: are you one of the Game of Thrones series' writers? :D
<Gold_Demona> Meanwhile his cousin Ustream seeks to overthrow his reign.
<Meanwhile> If I were it'd be nothing but "The Adventures of Tyrion Lannister"
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But what happened to Sir LimeV?
<Meanwhile> Because fucking hell that midget is amazing.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: the imp? he's awesome! :D
<Meanwhile> "Those are brave men knocking at our door....let's go kill them!"
<VenHur> Sir LimeV was roasted in the fireplace last Thanksgiving.
<VenHur> The poor laddie was burned inside the keetle.
<Gold_Demona> But really ALL of that is just a subplot. The REAL story is the epic adventure of the wheel that perpetually chases its tale
<Hoody|Skool> You can't trust wheels
<Gold_Demona> And the two boxes that incessantly taunt it
<VenHur> That, and flat tires...
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Where's that pic that explains why Trixie hates wheels?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I think MadSurge linked it the other day.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> It was Trixies marefriend in bed with a wheel
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and the refresh button that always menaces to crash the universe and restart everything
<Hoody|Skool> 3 ponies just went through my mind
<Hoody|Skool> Who was it?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yes, that dreaded refresh button! D:
<Hoody|Skool> The refresh button is my greatest weapon against the dreaded stream embed
<Gold_Demona> But then the buffer show will end. :<
<Gold_Demona> Or start over
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/8edb807d9c4a4e03bc8675029461cfd8.png :3c
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I'm confused now.
<Hoody|Skool> Eh, I got tired of that show after the 4th season, it never really developed
<Gold_Demona> I guess it did kind of go downhill after they brought in the two boxes. =/
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/97fdb50ff1adefa929d0885a549e912c.png *faceplant*
<AssaultWithEmbraces> So I guess "Trixie hates wheels" is a meme?
<VenHur> Peoples sleeping on a 24/7 stream site?
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: apparently
<VenHur> *punches them* NOPE
*Hoody|Skool licks VenHur
<Phase4> 00,02refresh your streams
<Meanwhile> No.
<Meanwhile> *Miserable cat face.*
<Gold_Demona> Awww, no more fireplace. :<
<Hoody|Skool> Phase4: There be nothin there
<jbh1145> hey
<Hoody|Skool> Hi
<VenHur> Phase4: I keep trowing my money everytime I refreshed, but nothing happened.
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_BL5EKwSqE fireplace :P
<jbh1145> oh now theres something on the stream
<Phase4> 00,02should see the ustream embed
<MadSurge> Wohoo, slideshow!
<MadSurge> We need more mod pics
<Gold_Demona> Yey! *goes to fireplace link*
<jbh1145> whoops i closed the browser by accident
<Hoody|Skool> If I wanted fire I'd just set something aflame
<Hoody|Skool> Or light my own fireplace
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJJ-QkZ8cM
<Havok> Phase4: You wanna join me on VS Ponyville? :3
<Meanwhile> So is anything going to show up or should I turn my youtube video back on?
*Hoody|Skool throws a cuccoo in the chat
<Jmo> Turn your youtube video back on.
<Phase4> 00,02Havok, i ragequit earlier today after i once again lost my go as hale due to server lag
<Hoody|Skool> Watch paint dry
<Phase4> 00,02its INCERDIBLY anoying
<Gold_Demona> I do not have this place of fire. So I have to make do with a fake one. :D
<Meanwhile> "Incerdibly"
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, quiet you
<Meanwhile> Ermahgerd
<jbh1145> 5,2,3,2,1
<Meanwhile> incerdibly errneying
<Jmo> Rofl.
<Phase4> 00,02there is a video underneath the ad
<Hoody|Skool> ._.
<Phase4> 00,02but ustream hates ponies
<jbh1145> frick
<Phase4> 00,02(i turned off my adblock so i can see what you guys see)
<jbh1145> HOOROROROROR
<Phase4> 00,02ok, ustream, when you show me the same ad twice it doesnt make me want to buy things twice as much
<jbh1145> HAX ME
<Phase4> 00,02infact all it does is make me hate you
<Hoody|Skool> Trixie was scouting ponyville with clones
<VenHur> Phase4: Damn it, Phase, why you no had AdBlock?!
<jbh1145> Y DO YOU HAVE TO USE USTREAM NOW?
<Gold_Demona> Because Mips broke
<jbh1145> I KNOW THAT BUT WHY NOT USE LIMEV OR VEMMI?
<Phase4> 00,02jbh1145, mips has security problems
<Meanwhile> Because everything else failed.
<Phase4> 00,02they don't have autoplay
<Phase4> 00,02also they suck
<Meanwhile> And at some point, this will fail too.
<Meanwhile> And the cycle will complete.
<Havok> Twitch?
<Hoody|Skool> Meanwhile: Then what will you do?
<Phase4> 00,02twitch is gaming only iirc
<Gold_Demona> Havok: Twitch hates Chrome and Safari
<Phase4> 00,02either twitch or justin
<jbh1145> i gtg
<Phase4> 00,02either way, limited in what you can stream
<Phase4> 00,02also the iframe problem
<Meanwhile> Watch something on youtube? It's not like I'd be missing much nowadays.
<Phase4> 00,02"cant load twitch.tv in a frame" why? no idea, they just complain
<MadSurge> Stream why u buffer so much
<Hoody|Skool> Is it weird that I eat coughdrops like candy?
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hoody|Skool: Nope
<Hoody|Skool> Sweet
<Hoody|Skool> I'm different :3
<Gold_Demona> I don't think that's good for you. O_o
<Meanwhile> Just like everyone else.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hoody|Skool: I eat Ricola like it's going out of style
<AssaultWithEmbraces> A pack is gone under an hour
<Hoody|Skool> Meanwhile: You're dour
<Meanwhile> Dour?
<Hoody|Skool> I chew gum like crack
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: I eat lemon flavored digestive all the time :D it's fizzy!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: ooooooh
<Hoody|Skool> Dour
<Phase4> 00,02stream working ok?
<Phase4> 00,02ffmpeg is behaving wierd here
<Meanwhile> Yeah I'm pretty dour.
<jbh1145> im back
<Jmo> You weren't missed.
<jbh1145> i know
<Jmo> Good.
*Gold_Demona gives jbh1145 a "welcome back" muffin. :>
<VenHur> Pinkie Pie now bears Fluttershy's element.
<Hoody|Skool> Jaymoo go discourage someone else
<VenHur> YOUR ARGUEMENT IS INVALID
<Meanwhile> argument*
<Hoody|Skool> VenHur: You're on fire
<Jmo> Hoody, how about you actually go learn something in school
<jbh1145> i hope ustream isnt always this laggy
<Hoody|Skool> I would if there was something to learn
<Jmo> I can imagine there is alot you need to learn.
<VenHur> Discord stoles the Element of Honesty...
<VenHur> That freaking cheater.
<jbh1145> O_O
<Meanwhile> Dat face.
<VenHur> Dat face...
<jbh1145> GOD
<MadSurge> This guy really has nothing to do all day
<Hoody|Skool> :) ]
<jbh1145> WELCOME TO THE JAM
<jbh1145> i think thats what there saying>
<Meanwhile> Come on and slam
<VenHur> And welcome to the jam!
<VenHur> Na na na na na!
<MadSurge> This game is canon
<jbh1145> MAGIC FREAKING KINDERGARDEN
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Is there buffer for anyone else?
<Hoody|Skool> Frame by frame analysis
<MadSurge> A lot :(
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oh, so it's not just me
<jbh1145> :[ :[
<VenHur> Magic Kindergarden = Proof that there's a MUCH worse schoolhouse then Sonic's.
<VenHur> Yes, Sonic had an educational game.
<jbh1145> <VenHur> wait? im not the only one who knows about that game?
<VenHur> UMAD?
<MadSurge> HI GIRRRLLLSSS
<jbh1145> i know about that
<ekips> ohai everyone
<MadSurge> Wb ekips!
<jbh1145> DAT BLINK
<Hoody|Skool> oi ekips, what be up
<VenHur> jbh1145: I know that trainwreck too...and my god...It was terrible...
<jbh1145> YEP
<ekips> MadSurge oh right, I was already here
<jbh1145> IT MAKES SONIC 06 LOOKS LIKE ET
<ekips> Hoody|Skool not much, just came back from the dentist
<Gold_Demona> Sonic 06 needs to be put out of its misery. >.>
<jbh1145> i mean IT MAKES SONIC 06 LOOK LIKE MARIO GALAXY
<jbh1145> THING
<Ninjazz> Sonic itself probably should kick the bucket.
<Ninjazz> Along with its rival.
<jbh1145> POSSIBLE
<jbh1145> WORST
<jbh1145> THE
<Hoody|Skool> ekips: You poor creature
<ekips> gnah, stream, why you die on me?
<jbh1145> plz dont tell me ustream is always this laggy
<Meanwhile> Ok, I won't tell you.
<Phase4> 00,02its probably the thing i was trying to ask you about before :P
<ekips> jbh1145 usually not
<Phase4> 00,02when i asked if the stream was ok
<Phase4> 00,02but no one responded :<
<jbh1145> i actually seems better now
<VenHur> Make a Sonic HD Collection (Think of Sonic 2 HD, only NOT cancelled) = My life is now complete.
<jbh1145> DERPY
<ekips> dat crowd
<jbh1145> sonic 2 hd= life complete
<VenHur> Too bad it was cancelled...
<jbh1145> sega could contiune it :D
<jbh1145> assss long as they dont give it to dimps
<jbh1145> SONIC 2, NOW WITH 80% MORE STICKING ON WALLS
<Gold_Demona> I played the crap out of Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 & Knuckles as a kid. :>
<ekips> dat !
<jbh1145> AND 99.99999999% LESS MOMENTUM
<Gold_Demona> Those two are still my top favorite Sonic games.
<Dark92Enigma> back and BLOOPERS!!!!!!!!
<Dark92Enigma> GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
<Dark92Enigma> Grapes. Carrot
<VenHur> At least Sonic Generations wasn't made from Dimps...otherwise, we could of had a MUCH worse game than 06 that will made us raises pitchforks and stabs SEGA.
<jbh1145> thank god generations was as good as it is
<Gold_Demona> I really liked Sonic Generations.
<ekips> I'd like to know how some of these mistakes could sneak into the show
<jbh1145> no great as it is, no AWESOME, OUTSANDTING, AMAZING!
<MadSurge> VenHur: there's a really funny Sonic 06 let's play on youtube
<VenHur> MadSurge: Oh, I loved the great Clement on Youtube.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ekips, it probably happens when the episode is finished and it looks fine when they go over it in Flash. Flash is a finnicky program when it wants to be
<jbh1145> oh yea clements review was beast
<MadSurge> VenHur: no, I'm talking about PokeCapn
<Gold_Demona> VenHur: I used to like Clement until he started getting WAY too angry and insulting towards his audience.
<VenHur> MadSurge: Never heard of PokeCapn, but i'll give him a shot.
<Gold_Demona> I kinda liked Brainscratch's let's play of Sonic 06, but Lewis is WAY too whiney.
<pony_8403> :S
<jbh1145> yea brainscrath is awesome too
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCwwxCL4iyw
<MadSurge> VenHur: it's like six people in one apartment suffering through it all :D
<VenHur> Clement is still okay with me, screw the general haters and amok.
<wipergone2> lol
<ekips> AssaultWithEmbraces well, since I've no clue about Flash, I just believe you ;)
<Gold_Demona> I prefer Johnny's standalone Let's Play of Sonic 06 that he did recently.
<MadSurge> VenHur: that final level is pure garbage btw
<ekips> stream laggy for someone else?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ekips: I've had a class in Adobe Flash and it's temperamental. Sometimes it'll coopperate with you, other times it just hisses at you for no reason.
<Gold_Demona> VenHur: Clement has a tendency to dwell on an argument and make it drag for WAY longer than it has to...
<VenHur> Aside from Crisis City, I never really cared about the other levels, cause they're forgetable and unnostalgic.
<wipergone2> WTF
<VenHur> But at least the music sounds good.
<wipergone2> AM LAGGING
<wipergone2> BADLY
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, things are breaking here
<VenHur> ...I think I'm seeing a pattern here, no matters if X6 and X7 were really bad games, the music are some of the best in the series.
<MadSurge> VenHur: the level with the one hit kill blackholes that appeared randomly
<VenHur> Same with Sonic 06 and others.
<ekips> Phase4 what's happening?
<wipergone2> Phase4: u busy?
<Phase4> 00,02ffmpeg cant communicate with ustream
<Phase4> 00,02no idea how or why
<Phase4> 00,02its gradually streaming slower and slower, resulting in more and more lag
<jbh1145> i actually have never played 06 and i was actually thinking about trying it but after watching clements review i completely changed my mind
<ekips> Phase4 I hope you'll figure out what's wrong :>
<wipergone2> Phase4: am a premuim
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, why you no bread yet? :|
<AdamTheDuck> Go to bread young man.
<jbh1145> wanna know an underrated sonic game? sonic heroes
<Ninjazz> Games just arn't fun anymore.
<jbh1145> i hate it when people say it sucks, its my first sonic game
<Gold_Demona> I've never played Sonic Heroes, so I can't make a fair judgement on it. I hear mixed opinions about it. =/
<Gold_Demona> I also hear that Sonic Colors is a good game, but only if you get the console version.
<Kandarihu> jbh1145, Touhou 10: Mountain of Faith was the first Touhou game I ever played. Most of the veteran Touhou players hate that game. But it turned me on to the whole series.
<jbh1145> <Gold_Demona> it is
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: so what's your current favorite Touhou game?
<jbh1145> i played pretty much every sonic game expect for sonic 06
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, I don't know.
<Gold_Demona> I'd never even heard of Touhou until people started talking about it in this chat. O_o
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's Japan's equivalent of Ponies :D it looks kiddish but has a ton of fans! The games though are definitely not for kids
<Gold_Demona> heh
<VenHur> I know of every single Sonic games known to the public, even Sonic Eraser!
<MadSurge> VenHur: what about that arcade game where Sonic must escape a death course?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Pokemans Pink / It's Also About.. / Derpy's Wish / Mystery Solved / Off the Charts
<Ryunosuke> i stopped paying attention after sonic 3 and knuckles
<pony_3045> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cEBbvZr5F8
<pony_3045> yes! Ponies and superjail!
<VenHur> MadSurge: SegaSonic The Hedgehog? Yeah, I know that game, I was so depressed that it didn't made into Sonic Gems Collection, nor Knuckles Chaotix.
<Meanwhile> I liked Sonic on the megadrive, after that it was more or less bollocks.
<Gold_Demona> Apparently Chaotix wasn't a gem, but Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine was. :D
<VenHur> Oh, and Sonic Shuffle is NOT a clone of Mario Party, because it was ALSO made by Hudsoft.
<VenHur> Though, it's true, the game sucks story-wise, but the gameplay wasn't THAT bad.
<MadSurge> I has a strawberry-vanilla lollipop :3
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Ooh MadSurge :3
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: lollipops are good :3
<AssaultWithEmbraces> They're delicious.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Makes you feel like a kid again

<Jmo> I hate everything about it. Does that help?
<MaxTheBrony> Kinda , yeah
<Jmo> :P
<MaxTheBrony> then i can remake it :P
<Snow> MaxTheBrony: if i would do that, it wouldnt be just art related
<Vivix> welp-
<Snow> jk
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Vivix> the angle is a bit steep on your perspective, his uh furthest away hind-leg seems a bit too small for it-
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah , that leg :s its hard as f' to get it look good
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Everlasting_Joy :)
<MaxTheBrony> and thus i think i should go with an other pose
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Everlasting_Joy !
<Vivix> draw his skeleton, it should be a bit closer and more eh
<alexxm> how are things Everlasting_Joy
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Everlasting_Joy
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy MLP_Brovakiin, MaxTheBrony and AssaultWithEmbraces!
<Sumica> 00,10back leg seems too small for perspective and ears seem too low
<CCharmanderK> This isn't really my kind of anime...
<Vivix> his flank on the furthest should be a bit more emphasized to match the other hindleg
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: So far so-so. I have a project I'm hoping to finish up or nearly finish up to do today :(.
