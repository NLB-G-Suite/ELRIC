<SilverMane> I was going to make a giant cupcake that took up all of the sugar rations in the country, and they started yelling at pinkie, and she makes the pun that she is 'Treading on thin icing'

<DSNesmith> pinkie could get away with so many pastry puns
<DSNesmith> and then the video was frozen

<Rezo-chan> Judge Dredd is dreadful.
<Rezo-chan> If, admittedly, hilarious
<SilverMane> here is the big set up for the treading on thin icing pun
<Hipster_Brony> 8beat me to it
<DSNesmith> judge dredd has that great scene at the end
<Ghosties> 4REV UP THOSE BANHAMMERS BOYS
<SilverMane> I was going to make a giant cupcake that took up all of the sugar rations in the country, and they started yelling at pinkie, and she makes the pun that she is 'Treading on thin icing'
<DSNesmith> with the ham-to-ham scene
<DSNesmith> mmm, enso
<Elky> huh?
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai Enzo
<DSNesmith> dat accent
<Nerpy> I WILL NOT SHOOT YOU WHILE CONTINUING TO SAY MY ONE CATCHPHRASE

<Darf14> I dread Judge Dread *troll face*
<DSNesmith> why you little punk!
<DSNesmith> acting!
<DSNesmith> hah
<Skor423> XD
<Rezo-chan> >Racist cop
<DSNesmith> that sound is sweet music
<MrPoniator> Dat sound
<Nerpy> Capitalism 101.

<Ghosties> 4EH?!
<Rezo-chan> mhm. deathstalker
<Snow> 18 Friends, and then I'll have 1000 friends on facebook! :D :D :D
*Rezo-chan needs to acquire those.
<Srake> Angry Italians Yelling: The Movie
<elky> suddenly, everything is lagging...
<Nerpy> Lag less over here...
<elky> I guess something's staringing my connection
<Srake> If you wanna get Dungeons of Dredmor, Watch a couple vidoes on Youtube first, to see if you'll like
<Ignaesia> it says you die... alot
<Srake> Yes you do...
<Nerpy> Husky is in this movie?
<Srake> It has Permadeath but you can turn it off
<Ghosties> 4Dungeons of Dredmor looks...okay
<elky> so it's a dungeon crawL?
<MrPoniator> And he laughs
<MrPoniator> Because killing is funny
<Srake> No, not really, Its a rougelike
<Elky> or rather a roguelike
<MrPoniator> hey, pinkie, it's fun!
<MrPoniator> Go on and make some cupcakes!
<Elky> roguelikes are awesome!
<Nittany_Tiger> Killing is funny.
<Elky> adom is great, but recently I've been getting into ToME
<Nerpy> Dem cops
<Srake> I played anband before I bought it to see if I'd like it
<SilverMane> ToMe?
<Srake> angband*
<Elky> mane: Tales Of Maj'Eyal
<Rezo-chan> It's a bouncing baby gun!
<Nerpy> Wut?
<Elky> it has a huge world
<Nerpy> Was that a bullet?
<NewDCD> 9god guys
<Ghosties> 4Holy shit, we're almost at the restaurant scene aren't we?
<Elky> but that of course means the world isn't very consistent though
<Ghosties> 4What's up?
<NewDCD> 9I've been working around with my audio settings and no dice
<Elky> still good fun
<Ghosties> 4Sucks
<NewDCD> 9can't find a way to ge-hey Ghosties I was lookin' for ya
<MrPoniator> So wait, how far in are in to the movie?
<NewDCD> 9found any game you like?
<Ghosties> 4Damn, this movie's going by fast today
<Elky> 1.5 hours?
<MrPoniator> derp
<Nerpy> like 40 ish minutes?
<Darf14> is it just me or is the movie going by quicker?
<MrPoniator> It is
<Ghosties> 4People have suggested Dungeons of Dredmor, but I'm not sold on it
<DSNesmith> I think it's because we're totally not talking about the movie in chat
<MrPoniator> Because no one is watching it
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I suspsect it's because it's earlier, and we're more alert
<MrPoniator> Except when the SFX happens
<Srake> Playing DoD Makes this movie go by fast
<Ghosties> 4Another game in mind was Civilization III complete
<Ghosties> 4Still
<HaveTubaWillTravel> The DSII sound effect is helping, too
<Ghosties> 4I don't know yet
<NewDCD> 9so yeah, haven't found a way to capture audio from my USB audio headphones so yeah
<NewDCD> 9ah, well
<Elky> I guess it's because we're actually chatting and not just shouting in hope of getting noticed
<SirSprinkles> 6Civ III is pretty fun.
<NewDCD> 9don't worry n'take your time
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Well said, Elky.
<Darf14> Eeyup
<Elky> chat is way too fast sometimes on fridays
<Ghosties> 4Right, will do
<Snow> Downloading DoD rightnow
<DSNesmith> >implying we're not shouting and hoping to be noticed
<MrPoniator> Friday night is too manestream
<Srake> that be the truth
<Ghosties> 4Does this mean you can't mic over games?
<Srake> )
<Snow> xD
<Skor423> What.
<Elky> aargh
<HaveTubaWillTravel> What what, Skor423?
<Srake> That was the best one yet
<Darf14> I agree, chat can go by very fast on Fridays and it is hard to keep up
<prince-dari> Don't you just use VAC?
<NewDCD> 9I can, buuuuuut
<SirSprinkles> 6PENUCKLE
<NewDCD> 9nah, I use Stereo Mix
<DSNesmith> well once we get like 200+ people
<SilverMane> looks interesting Elky, I'll give it a shot
<Skor423> Random sound for random scene
<DSNesmith> all spamming toot/forever
<NewDCD> 9thing is, I want audio output to be from the PC to my headphones
<Srake> And we're not shouting about Leverage either
<HaveTubaWillTravel> You must be new here.
<NewDCD> 9I suppose I could get a mini-jack extension cable...
<Elky> silvermane: have you played ADoM?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Or at least, you didn't see Death Stalker II
<Ghosties> 4Dungeons of Dredmor doesn't appear to be for me
<Darf14> Leverage is over rated
<NewDCD> 9and just plug them into the audio input instead
<Ghosties> 4No dice, I'm not sold : /
<prince-dari> You want the computer sound to go to your headphones?
<Elky> if not, try it first
<MrPoniator> Is there a way to put this on slow mode (can't post more than once in a minute or so)?
<Srake> alright
<SilverMane> ADoM? Ok, hat's that?
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<Elky> it's like the best roguelike ever
<Nerpy> Whom?
<NewDCD> 9yeah, pretty much
<Elky> it doesn't have as much content, but it's very, very immersive
<SilverMane> Ancient Domane of something?
<prince-dari> You can do that with VAC.
<NewDCD> 9I have this USB microphone headset thing
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9I was trying to do that with VAC
<Elky> Ancient Domains Of Mystery
<MrPoniator> Gotta get some food
<NewDCD> 9but I can't get it to work
<Ghosties> 4Is it on Steam?
<NewDCD> 9so using Occam's Razor
<Elky> and it was developed by a german guy
<Srake> im gonna take a look at it
<Elky> lol ghosties
<NewDCD> 9I'm just gonna go for the easiest solution
<prince-dari> Hmm, ok.
<Ghosties> 4What
<SilverMane> okay
<NewDCD> 9as a matter of fact I got an extension cable right here
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9http://kotaku.com/5805740/bloodrayne-is-doing-its-best-castlevania-impression
<NewDCD> 9holy fuck I wish that came out in Steam
<Ghosties> 4I'm asking a serious question
<Nerpy> so familiar
<HaveTubaWillTravel> MANRY HUG
<Elky> the whole genre is way too nerdy for steam
<Ghosties> 4So I'll take that as a "no"
<Elky> who plays games with ascii graphics today anymore?
<Srake> Ya Dredmor has so many refrences in it
<Hipster_Brony> brb
<Elky> no it isn't
<Darf14> good point
<DSNesmith> anyone play dorfs
<Darf14> unless its a flash game
<mib_n26zgz> http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/117/008/original/soon_honey_beer_bottle.jpg?1303752607 http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/117/008/original/soon_honey_beer_bottle.jpg?1303752607 http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/117/008/original/soon_honey_beer_bottle.jpg?1303752607 http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/117/008/original/soon_honey_beer_bottle.jpg?1303752607
<Elky> except dwarf fortress ofc
<HonkyDory> i still play diablo II
<Ignaesia> I tried playing DF but it went over my head
<Elky> but most people use a tileset for that too
<DSNesmith> dorfs scares me
<Srake> I leveled up!
<DSNesmith> the menus... so many menus...
<Elky> it's fun once you get the hang of it
<SilverMane> so is it possible to play ADoM without joining this website?
<Elky> yes it is
<Elky> but as I said, it's an ascii game, so beware
<Donitz> ADOM <3
<DSNesmith> http://df.magmawiki.com/images/4/40/FunComic.png
<Donitz> it's freaking addicting
<Ghosties> 4Wow, it certainly does look like Castlevania
<Elky> i keep coming back to it every month or so
<MrPoniator> DSN, lol
<Donitz> I keep getting frustrated after I reach like level 16 and go get more than I could handle
<Donitz> every time
<Elky> I've played it for ~3 years and only won once
<Srake> XD
<Donitz> killer claw bugs are nasty
<prince-dari> Do you eat?
<Darf14> Whats level of addicting is it at? is it at oh I forgot what time it is addicting or OMG I forgot to feed my child addicting?
<Elky> not with spells
<Donitz> You eat EVERYTHING
<Donitz> no seriously
<Rezo-chan> The soundeffect has really lost its novelty and humour value. Just saying.
<Elky> rezo: don't even joke about that
<Elky> the sound effect is holy
<Ghosties> 4Rezo clearly hasn't seen Deathstalker II
<NewDCD> 9like Castlevania on crack
<NewDCD> 9and that can only be a good thing
<Darf14> clearly
<Ghosties> 4I dunno
<Skor423> No subtitles?
<DSNesmith> we must educate him
<RainBroDash> 10D:
<Elky> clearly
<HonkyDory> no idea what they're talking about
<HaveTubaWillTravel> BIZINISS
<MrPoniator> We need a new sound effect
<Ghosties> 4Castlevania on crack may not be such a good thing
<DSNesmith> is this english
<DSNesmith> or italian
<RainBroDash> 10after seeing that film I realised that my life was incomplete before seeing Deathstalker II
<HonkyDory> italian
<MrPoniator> Italian
<Elky> there's no better sound effect
<DSNesmith> I can't tell the difference with these guys
<Ignaesia> italiano
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Same here, RainBro
<Elky> I think it's italian
<SilverMane> The Room > Deathstalker II
<Darf14> Its time like this I wish I could understand Italian
<SilverMane> (troll face.jpg)
<Elky> the room was boring
<Skor423> This movire requires more subtitles.
<Skor423> The Room./
<Elky> even with the chat
<RainBroDash> 10Dirty sexy lies SilverMane!
<Skor423> O dear God.
<DSNesmith> speaking of Room-level badness
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm going for a smoke.
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, everything I do is dirty and sexy
<DSNesmith> has anyone seen Birdemic?
<MrPoniator> Italian bronies, come save us from dem italians!
*SilverMane does the dishes
<Elky> deathstalker at least knew how cheesy it was
<DSNesmith> Birdemic: Shock and Terror
<HonkyDory> i think the point is to alienate us, the viewers, to tell us there's something we don't get to know about
<SilverMane> see?
<HonkyDory> and that's bullshit
<DSNesmith> best hitchcock ripoff ever made
<Ghosties> 4Don't fall asleep this time :P
<SilverMane> I did the dishes... sexy
<MrPoniator> Well
<MrPoniator> That's awkward
<Srake> Ds2 Soundeffect spam
<DSNesmith> they were having a conversation about who is best pony
*RainBroDash 10would lol, but is evidently as prone to the same thing happening.
<DSNesmith> and this is what happens when you do that
<DSNesmith> people get shot
<Hipster_Brony> back
<HonkyDory> taken out behind the shed, shot, and then turned into glue?
<Elky> I can imagine SilveMane doing the dishes... all oiled up
<SilverMane> oh Elky, you naughty boy. *giggle*
<Elky> actually silvermane does anything oiled up
<MrPoniator> Shooting is so fun, shooting is so fun, it's time to check and see what we've done
<MrPoniator> Yay, they're dead!
<Hipster_Brony> 8inb4 HEADSHOT!
<DSNesmith> inb4 neck hole
<Donitz> d-d-double kill?
<Srake> TRAIN!
<SilverMane> BOOM HEADSHOT
<Darf14> He totally saw it coming
<DSNesmith> pretty little headshots
<Rezo-chan> taht took a while
<Srake> Gag reflex
<DSNesmith> DSII sound
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That's what you get for saying Fluttershy is the worst pony
<DSNesmith> need it
<Elky> >ds2
<Srake> The movie stole it
<MrPoniator> Dramatic music
<Elky> but Fluttershy IS worst pony
<Skor423> Requires more dramatic music.
<Darf14> Authentic news
*HaveTubaWillTravel loves and tolerates the shit out of Elky's pony preferences
<Ghosties> 4@Elky: I gotta go to the bathroom
<DSNesmith> was this made before the spinning newspaper was a cliche
<Hipster_Brony> 8Dash is best pony
<Sathi> 7probably
<MrPoniator> Rarity is the worst pony (shit storm brewing up...)
<Hipster_Brony> 8 /discussion
<Darf14> Prohibition law caused all of this
*Rezo-chan agrees with Elky, actually.
<Elky> ghosties: I don't get it, are you clopping?
<Rezo-chan> Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash are inferior ponies.
<DSNesmith> hipster, time for that trollbait comic
<Srake> LOUD MUSIC IS LOUD
<Ghosties> 4ANNOYING TRUMPET
<HonkyDory> Rarity FTW
<Elky> why isn't there any flute though?
<Ignaesia> Rarity is best pony
<Elky> Rarity has the best voice actor
<Darf14> Rainbow and Pinkie FTW
<Srake> Braeburn is Best Pony
<DSNesmith> another scene of people walking
<Elky> Tabitha St. Germain is amazong
<Ghosties> 4Darf14: Wrong, Ashleigh Ball is best voice actress
<Rezo-chan> Rarity > Twilight > the other four ponies.
<Ghosties> 4Though, I do like Tara Strong
<SilverMane> FLUTTERSHY > Luna > Twilight = Trixie > Rarity > Others, although I think Octavia works into there somewhere
<MrPoniator> I like 'em all
<RainBroDash> 10brb
<DSNesmith> I love all of them equally (but Rarity is best pony)
<Darf14> I like them all but those two are my favorites
<Elky> everybody likes them all, but we like arguing more
<MrPoniator> But just that Rarity is the least likeable for me
<SilverMane> ohyou.jpg
<HonkyDory> you have to give a lot of credit to Pinkie Pie, she's the only one out of the mane six brave enough to break the 4th wall
<MrPoniator> Not that there's anything particurally wrong with her
<Ignaesia> Fluttershy broke the 4th wall
<Rezo-chan> How could anyone not like Rarity? :(
<Donitz> quiet the manchild please
<SilverMane> when did Fluttershy break the fourth wall?
<Ignaesia> "Always Works!"
<DSNesmith> I don't understand the lack of rarity love after the Dress episode
<HaveTubaWillTravel> "Always works," SilverMane
<HonkyDory> yeah, i don't remember that
<HaveTubaWillTravel> In Bird in the Hoof
<MrPoniator> He gave birth to a baby
<SilverMane> oh
<Srake> Has the Domestic violence scene already happened?
<SilverMane> really? that's the best you got? Pinkie Pie grabbed the closing screen and exited the show to talk to us once
<DSNesmith> isn't this all domestic violence?
<Ghosties> 4It could have been just a way to assert herself
<Espeon> 06Nom
<DSNesmith> they are a FAMILY after all
*DSNesmith gets booed offstage
<Ghosties> 4To show that she's right to herself
<Rezo-chan> By domestic violence, do you mean a long, hard, bare bottomed hairbrush spanking for a naughty and disobedient wife?
<SilverMane> Rarity is on my top list BECAUSE of Art of the Dress
<SirSprinkles> 6Back
*SilverMane thinks DSNesmith likes Rarity for good reason.
<HonkyDory> same here, but also Dog and Pony show
<DSNesmith> dog and pony was brilliant too
<Rezo-chan> There are lots of reasons to approve of rarity, even outside of her two key episodes.
<DSNesmith> although the dog voice actors were a little shrill
<Srake> No i mean Belt whipping
<Sathi> 7wb
<Darf14> Art of the Dress and Dog and Pony show made Rarity cool
<prince-dari> Modfoals can't soonforce. :P
<SilverMane> Rarity, honestly, has the best episodes that focus on her
<HonkyDory> diamond dogs *tehehe* i see what you did there Lauren Faust
<HaveTubaWillTravel> More than 20% cooler
<RainBroDash> 10idk, i still dont like rarity :P
<Ignaesia> Rarity gained alot of points for me during Suited for Success but the WA HA HA sealed it
<SilverMane> Rainbow Dash is always arrogant in her episodes, AppleJack is far too focused on her apples, Twilight is just a stuck up prick in her episodes, and Pinkie is depressed nitwit in her episodes. Rarity is always an overworked nice person though
<Elky> silvermane is right, y'know
<Ghosties> 4SilverMane: Dog and a Pony Show gave fanboys a reason to clop to her
<DSNesmith> Rarity isn't snooty, she's /artistic/
<HaveTubaWillTravel> SilverMane is indeed right
<Hipster_Brony> 8DAT RACISM
<Elky> which is why Rarity is third best pony
<SilverMane> inb4 Rarity in bondage
*DSNesmith grabs pen and paper
<MrPoniator> Oh god, rarity is naked
<SilverMane> clopclopclop
<Elky> where?
<prince-dari> Dash isn't arrogant.
<Rezo-chan> >dat flankspank
<HaveTubaWillTravel> EVERYWHERE
<MrPoniator> Does she know any shame?
<Elky> Silvermane/Rarity porn
<DSNesmith> it's not shame, it's dignity
<Ghosties> 4Applejack cares about her family more than her apples
<Aeroslash> hi Espeon
<MrPoniator> She makes dresses for living, but is naked all the time!
<Elky> just throwing it out there
<Rezo-chan> Dash is a bogstandard jock character with a mild asshoel streak, the likes of which exist by the millions.
<Darf14> Good Gravy! They are all naked!
<Rezo-chan> A WELL DONE character of that type, but still.
<Ghosties> 4So, don't know what SilverMane is trying to say there
<prince-dari> " Having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one's own importance or abilities" < definition. There's notthing more imporant than Dash, and no one is as skilled as her, therefore not arrogant.
<HonkyDory> who goes to the most important party in all of equestria with her friends just so she can sell apples? that's just showing a lack of social grace. I bet she didn't even have a vendor permit
<DSNesmith> Just imagine them all in their underwear
<DSNesmith> oh, wait.
<prince-dari> nothing*
<Donitz> celestia is never naked
<SilverMane> Elky, DO IT
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Applejack is the only not-naked pony thanks to her hat
<Darf14> suddenly we are in Italy
<Elky> silvermane, I'll ask /co/
<Rezo-chan> Applejack's rural-ness shows, yes.
<MrPoniator> And suddenly we have subtitles
<Espeon> 06hii
<MrPoniator> And before we didnät
<Ghosties> 4HonkyDory: I'm sure you're just trying to troll, but she did it for her family
<Rezo-chan> No idea what high society even IS
<SilverMane> DSNesmith, ship me and Rarity so that Elky doesn't have to go to /co/
<Elky> they'll do anxthing if I say it'll piss ponychan of
<Darf14> dang, Italy looks nothing like the mushroom kingdom
<MrPoniator> Silly you
<Rezo-chan> The mushroom kingdom is japanese
<SilverMane> its' mushroom kingdom because they are all ON mushrooms
<Ignaesia> arent they in Sicily?
<MrPoniator> Mushroom Kingdom is in Brooklyn!
<DSNesmith> It was a slow day. Rarity idly passed the fabric through her sewing machine, watching the stitches slip in and out.
<Rezo-chan> hey...
<DSNesmith> A knock on the door drew her attention-a customer?
<HonkyDory> well they sure aren't in Equestria that's for sure
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I like where this is going, DSN
<Rezo-chan> We NEED Super Mario Brothers on BMN
<Elky> >slip in and out
<MrPoniator> Oh boy, a fic in middle of a chat
<Elky> and I'm spent
<prince-dari> Rezo-chan: Too late.
<Ghosties> 4DSNesmith is about to do a fanfic
<Ghosties> 4EVERYBODY WATCH OUT
<DSNesmith> "Ah, welcome to the Carousel Botique!" she began
<Srake> God I'm so sick of SHip
<Rezo-chan> Already happened?
<Rezo-chan> dammit
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<DSNesmith> stopping in shock as the door opened.
<prince-dari> DO YOU EAT?
*RainBroDash 10is poised and waiting for the clopfest
<Elky> ready the tissues!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> This is a more riveting story than the movie
<DSNesmith> There stood a pony she didn't recognize-his silvery mane shimmering in the sunlight
<MrPoniator> Suddenly, rape
<DSNesmith> She'd never seen color so striking
<Srake> Inb4 Its silvermane
<Ghosties> 4RAPE HER
<Elky> and then they all hugges
<Ignaesia> then rarity was phone
<DSNesmith> she had to style it. She HAD TO
<Rezo-chan> Rarity and the octopus.
*SilverMane likes where this is going.
<Elky> oclopus
<DSNesmith> "My dear, what can I do for you?" She asked, still staring lustfully at the stranger's mane.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Elky> xD
<Ghosties> 4Oh boy
<MrPoniator> lustfully
<SilverSonic|Live> ESPEON *glomp*
<SilverSonic|Live> :3
<Elky> 'lustfully'
<Rezo-chan> I approve of this.
<Rezo-chan> Although it needs more forced consent.
<Darf14> Rarity X Octopus, nah too Japanese for my taste....YOU HEARD NOTHING!
<DSNesmith> "Ah, pizza delivery," he said.
<MrPoniator> :D
<Elky> Rarity eats pizza?
<SilverMane> lol
<HonkyDory> and then spike found out and beat rarity to death in a jealous rage
<Ghosties> 4A delivery boy? How original
<Srake> But then a pony burst in with a bomb strapped to his chest, "Praise Celestia" He said as he tackled SilverMane.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> SUCH MOUTH
<Elky> >implying Spike isn't watching thorugh a crack in the wall
*DSNesmith laughs evilly
<SilverMane> i love how much attention I get on this site
<Elky> Spike is a voyeur kind of guy
<Darf14> you sure are an attention magnet
<DSNesmith> "I don't recall ordering any-" Rarity began, when suddenly three smaller ponies stampeded past her toward the door.
<Elky> xD
<DSNesmith> "CUTIE MARK CRUSADER PIZZA PARTY!" they all shouted
<RainBroDash> 10YAY*
<MrPoniator> Okay
*SilverMane really likes where this is going.
<HonkyDory> yeah, he probably has hidden cameras set up in her bedroom
*HaveTubaWillTravel also
<Srake> Good lord silvermane
<MrPoniator> Orgy with Rarity and CMC?
*Nittany_Tiger leaves channel.
<Nittany_Tiger> Have fun, kids.
<Elky> and then they all fucked and were subsequently jailed
<DSNesmith> The three fillies grabbed the pizza box and ran out the door, leaving behind a stunned Rarity and Pizzapony
<SilverMane> oh RainBroDash, don't get jealous, Rarity is just so beautiful.
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 11 minutes
<Ghosties> 4Pizzapony's his name
<Ghosties> 4Gotcha
<RainBroDash> 10SHUT UP SILVERMANE NOPONYLOVESYOULIKEIDO
<Elky> *already clops furiously*
<RainBroDash> 10;_;
<Darf14> AHHH!, The mental images!
<DSNesmith> "Uh, so, you gonna pay for this?" asked the pizzapony.
<Elky> 'pay'
<HonkyDory> applause
*PizzaPony hugs RainBroDash to comfort him.
<DSNesmith> "I'm afraid I haven't got any money on me..." said Rarity nervously.
<RainBroDash> 10:<
<Elky> I love how cheesy this is
<Srake> Oh noes,
<Ghosties> 4He's a "thing" now?
<MrPoniator> The cliches
<DSNesmith> "but I'm sure I could find some /other/ way to pay you."
<Ghosties> 4Really?
<SilverMane> lol Elky pun
<MrPoniator> Oh the cliches
<Ghosties> 4We're insulting Pizzapony?
<french> This isn't cheezy!
<SirSprinkles> 6ITC: Shipping.
<RainBroDash> 10Oh shit. This genuinely looks like a classic porn intro.
<DSNesmith> "how about I make you a dress!"
<Max> Oh damn
<Max> i love this movie
<Max> xD
<Srake> Oh
<DSNesmith> "a... dress."
<SilverMane> MAKE ME A DRESS
<MrPoniator> This, during the Godfather
<RainBroDash> 10and with that, RBD was proved flamboyantly wrong
<RainBroDash> 10>.<
<DSNesmith> "Oh, why, certainly!"
<MrPoniator> Wait
<MrPoniator> he likes dresses?
<Ignaesia> I want a Rarity original
<DSNesmith> "Erm, male ponies don't usually wear dresses."
<Ghosties> 4I don't like where this is going
<SilverMane> PERFECT TIMING
<DSNesmith> "BUT MY DEAR, YOUR HAIR!"

<french> patience...
<DSNesmith> "It'S SO PERFECT, I simply must create an ensemble piece around it."
<Ghosties> 4Huh, she could kinda pass off for Olivia Munn
<SilverMane> mmmm
<SilverMane> Olivia Munn...
<RainBroDash> 10mfw silvermane ends up going transgender and seducing rainbrodash and then all was normal again.
<HonkyDory> i feel like a lot of this movie's problems could be solved if they just made each other dresses and giggled at the ghosties
<DSNesmith> "Look, I've got some more deliveries to make later this afternoon..."
<DSNesmith> "No, no, I insist!" Rarity slammed the door shut and locked it with her magic.
<SilverMane> dammit RainBroDash, i was drinking when I read that. Almost spat it out all ove rmy laptop
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<DSNesmith> "Come upstairs, and let's get busy!"
<Elky> don't get me started on transgender... did you know Deathstalker 1 has two sex changes?
<RainBroDash> 10THAT LINE
<Ghosties> 4YOU WILL DRESS FOR ME!
<RainBroDash> 10FUKKIN SAVED
<Rezo-chan> ...
*SilverMane really, REALLY likes where this is going.
<Elky> get busy
<Rezo-chan> Must watch Desthstalker I
<MrPoniator> Is someone going to compile this and post on EqD?
<Elky> this is gonna get hawt...
<DSNesmith> sighing, Pizzapony followed her upstairs. Why did so many ponies in this town fall all over themselves around him?
<RainBroDash> 10I am MrPoniator, don't you worry
<french> I've got to be honest, I've been away for a while and am still a tad confused as to why we're doing a clopfic in the chat...
<SilverMane> YES! Reference joke!
<Srake> Ithink we should with all the interrruptions in it
<Ghosties> 4Because Godfather is boring
<Ghosties> 4That's why
<Elky> french, because SilverMane
<Ghosties> 4So we're entertaining ourselves
<Srake> Like it actually is someone trying to tell a story
<RainBroDash> 10silvermane, this is your life
<SilverMane> french, it's because SilverMane me, and they love me
<MrPoniator> I sometimes even forget we're watching the Godfather
<french> That's all the excuse I need ^^
<prince-dari> Because everypony wants to ship with SilverMane.
<Darf14> The movie has it boring parts, but it is still a good movie
<RainBroDash> 10darf14, what movie?
<prince-dari> Haha, RainBro.
<SilverMane> lol
<Darf14> The God Father silly
<Srake> I don't want...
<Rezo-chan> It's a forgettable movie. Live-written clop fiction isn't.
<SilverMane> MORE SHIPPING DSNESMITH
<MrPoniator> Screw brony movie night
<Ignaesia> Its the most praised movie ever so its bound to have lots of haters
<Elky> I'll have to watch this movie alone... I honestly can't pay attention while clopping to SilverManexrarity clopfiction
<DSNesmith> "Alright, I'll need you to lift your hooves up here for me, darling." Rarity scurried arond her shop, looking for her measuring tape.
<MrPoniator> Let's do more live clop fic writing
<Ghosties> 4Ignaesia: Actually, Citizen Kane is the most praised movie ever
<HonkyDory> shut up bitch and make me a sammich
<SilverMane> this is the 3rd time I've seen someone write a shipper live
<french> I don't know why this has never happened before!
<RainBroDash> 10calling it. next week this will be a regular saturday feature.
<MrPoniator> inb4 she bondage rapes him
<DSNesmith> "Oh, there it is!" Rarity picked up her measuring tape, turning around.
<DSNesmith> "Now, I'm just missing one thing-"
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, I won't be here next two weeks
<DSNesmith> "aha!"
<Rezo-chan> apparently all the best films are fucking snorefests. Citizen Kane, The Godfather...
<RainBroDash> 10But SilverMane, I...
<Elky> >measuringt tape...
<DSNesmith> her horn glowed as she magically lifted her incredibly stylish designing glasses onto her nose.
<drfsupercenter> 03I just passed a guy having a yard sale

<Elky> is there a proper text version of that sound effect?
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't have a car on campus either
<Ghosties> 4Elky: !!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Ghosties> 4There
<prince-dari> Oh leverage.

<DSNesmith> The pizzapony shuffled his feet awkwardly. "Uh, I'd rather you didn't fool around with my horn."

<prince-dari> Bjornfot: No, we're watching live action clopfiction.
<DSNesmith> "Oh, don't be silly, darling, it's all for the art." Rarity stretched the tape out.
<Bjornfot> I'm only here for Leverage, really.
<Lightumbreon> 06hitting it with the forklifter is awesome, with a lot of mess afterwards :P
<DSNesmith> "My goodness, I've never seen one quite this large before!"

<MrPoniator> Exactly
<Hipster_Brony> btw guys, keep an eye on this shipping
<HeavyMetalPony> Brando's accent should duke it out in an arena with Jeff Bgidge's True Grit accent

<SirSprinkles> 6Trust me.
<SirSprinkles> 6I am.
<Srake_The_Grimdark> A voice that sounded very much like Srake said "Uh, we don't normally wear clothes, do we?"
<HeavyMetalPony> and I still wouldn't understand them
<RainBroDash> 10>very much like applebloom's. It was applebloom's through the muffle of a gimp mask imho
<SilverMane> I am recording this entire conversation, for the annals.
<Ghosties> 4Don Corleone and Rooster Codburn, now THAT'S an awesome duo
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Rarity looked around, frantically. She magically opened her closet and stuffed Pizzapony inside.
<Captain_of_the_Ship> "Uh, just a minute!"
<Elky> the old closet trick? nice...
<SilverMane> and that is how i died
<MrPoniator> Someone must post this on /oat/ and EqD after this is done
<Elky> gotta love cliches
<Srake_The_Grimdark> I thought it said chest
<Snow> Is it cold in here, or are my nipples all over the place?
<HonkyDory> "now I'm trapped in the closet, so I pulled out my gun.."
<Srake_The_Grimdark> Stuff Pizzapony in a chest
<HaveTubaWiIITravel> Agreed with MrPoniator.
<SilverMane> WAT
<HaveTubaWiIITravel> YOU MUST
<Captain_of_the_Ship> She slammed the closet shut and turned around, panting. The door burst open and the three Cutie Mark Crusaders charged inside.
<Elky> dammit snow, stop poking me with your nipples!

<Captain_of_the_Ship> Applebloom and Scootaloo began searching the room for their capes, digging under desks and knocking over models.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah

<Captain_of_the_Ship> "Whatcha doin' sis?" asked Sweetie Belle.
<MrPoniator> Wait

<Captain_of_the_Ship> "Oh, uh, nothing, Sweetie..." Rarity said, nervously eyeing the closet.

<Srake_The_Grimdark> Is pizzapony gonna come out of the closet?
<Ghosties> 4And I need to enlist the aid of Gilda and Derp
<Elky> apple family is best family
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Sweetie trotted over to the closet, reaching for the door. Rarity gasped-
<HeavyMetalPony> Strangely sounds like the Spanish Luigi from SMB
<Elky> that joke gave me cancer srake
<Darf14> Pizzapony better deliver my pizza asap
<Ghosties> 4I've got all ten circus achievements and I need help so I can get the Abusement Park achievement

<Hipster_Brony> 8BAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Captain_of_the_Ship> "FOUND EM!" yelled Scootaloo, holding up a trio of gold capes.

<Elky> the cmc ate the pizza already
<HeavyMetalPony> Do they ever eat the pizzas in pornos?
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Rarity listened at the door, waiting for the sound of the three fillies to fade into the distance.
<MrPoniator> Pizza fetish
<Hipster_Brony> 8Dashite: eeeeeeeeeeyup

<Hipster_Brony> 8AND THEN A SKELETON POPPED OUT

<Srake_The_Grimdark> Everypony knows Rarity is a notorious book thief
<Elky> hot unicorn action
<MrPoniator> THE BOOK IS UNDER THE BED
<PizzaPony> it's called 'Magic Book'
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Rarity made a little 'eep' sound.
<Captain_of_the_Ship> "Er, what book was it?"
<HaveTubaWiIITravel> It's called "Karma Sutra"
<Dermathil> Ohai everybrony
<MrPoniator> I'm sure the book is "Clopping is magic"
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Twilight blushed. "Um,

<HeavyMetalPony> (:
<Ignaesia> Michael is way more threatening than Vito, agree?
<PizzaPony> pm'd you, Captain
<Captain_of_the_Ship> "Um, it's, er..."
<Dashite> One of these days I'm going to be as famous as Tacowiz!
<Ghosties> 4Well, Michael has that youth going for him
<Captain_of_the_Ship> "Reform School Fillies." Twilight blushed harder.

<Elky> classy
<Srake_The_Grimdark> DAMMIT!
<french> lol
<MrPoniator> Classy
<Hipster_Brony> 8dashite: thats not something to strive for
<PizzaPony> it's from 'Twilight and Rarity's Magic Book'
<RainBroDash> 10that fic...
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Rarity's eyebrow raised. "Sorry, Twilight, I don't have that here. Why don't you try the... OTHER bookstore?"
<RainBroDash> 10oh lawdy
<Ignaesia> true ghosties
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> BROTHER WANTS ATTENTION, SEND HIM TO LAS VEGAS
<Elky> we know pizza
<MrPoniator> I would've suggested "You can't rape a stallion"
<french> Oh,its worrying that I know the book...
*Dermathil starts to look around the chat for a possible lawnchair target.
<Srake_The_Grimdark> Its Deathstalker 2 the novelization
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Twilight winced, and ran off. "Thanks, Rarity, sorry to bother you."
*SnowPony thinks this movie can go trip on a sidewalk.
<Sathi> 7hehehe
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<MrPoniator> OOPSIE
<Dermathil> what was that sound?
<HeavyMetalPony> wow
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Rarity shut the door. "Drat, I wondered when she'd notice I never returned it."
<Ghosties> 4Michael has nothing to feel sorry about
<HeavyMetalPony> flutterguy
<Ghosties> 4He did the right thing

<Elky> lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Who came up with "The Fluttershy Effect" title? He can help me with this.
*PizzaPony likes where this is going
<Skor423> What.
<Ignaesia> all the scenes with Michael as the Godfather are much more interesting
<Dermathil> WHO IS PLAYING WITH A SOUNDBOARD?!
<SirSprinkles> 6Can you blame me? I've seen this movie three times in three days now.
<Elky> ghosties! but I thought you...
<PizzaPony> The Fluttershy Effect is a play on 'The Butterfly Effect', and is actually a pretty good story
<Sathi> 7nah i'm not blaming you
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Rarity had an idea, and she grinned devilishly. "Oh, Pizzapony, let's try something new!"
<HeavyMetalPony> bastuhd
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> THIS MOVIE IS AN EXAMINATION ON THE DARKSIDE OF THE ITALIAN MAFIA AND THE RISKY DARK BUSINESS ASSOCIATED WITH IT
<NightSeas> 12Is there a script that will show you random quotes from IRC?
<Ghosties> 4Well, the BIGGEST reason is because Michael is actually intimidating AND I UNDERSTAND HIM WHEN HE TALKS
<Elky> something new...
<MrPoniator> Oh god, oh god
<Nittany_Tiger> Watched the movie.
<MrPoniator> This fic is getting kinky

<Dashite> But it's rocket powered... how can it be non-lethal?!
*PizzaPony really, really, REALLY likes where this is going.

<HeavyMetalPony> Once that pie enters his lower intestine, boom
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Pizzapony's head began moving south. Rarity breathed deep in expectation, when suddenly-

<HeavyMetalPony> Godfather theme hint?
<Srake_The_Grimdark> Yes i went there
<Elky> O.O
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Applejack stared at the door expectantly. It slammed open to reveal Rarity, her mane a mess and her eye quivering like Pinkie on a sugar high.
<HeavyMetalPony> let's have
<RainBroDash> 10pizzapony don't be silly, you'll never be as amazing as silvermane
<HeavyMetalPony> a PARTAY

<Skor423> O NO
<Ignaesia> my thetans levels are at an all time high
<Skor423> NOOOO
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, but then they can't change back afterwards.
<DrDoom> Lolol Scientology
<prince-dari> Good leverage with counting all the leverages.
<Elky> it's the distant future, the year 3000
<SirSprinkles> 6They'd have to leave the channel and change.
<Captain_of_the_Ship> inb4 side character dies offscreen
<Srake_The_Grimdark> OARNGE AIR!
<Elky> we are robots

<HeavyMetalPony> inb4 I vomit fro mthe camera angles
<Darf14> Man is an endangered species? are they ripping that part off of Battlestar Galactica?
<MrPoniator> Hasbro is done with conquering the world by then
<RainBroDash> 10you won't be able to do any mod stuff for that time signed in under a non mod name anyway?
<HeavyMetalPony> lol
<RainBroDash> 10it makes 0 difference.
<HaveTubaWiIITravel> Glad I'm not the only one, HeavyMetal

<HeavyMetalPony> is this movie MLP-audio-ified too>
<DrDoom> Vader knows that feel,bro.
<prince-dari> That man animal, I can tell he has leverage.
<Hipster_Brony> thats why we have multiple mods though

<Sol> http://imgur.com/LQ0gr.jpg
<HeavyMetalPony> Never saw this, only the NC review
<SirSprinkles> 6True, but still.
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Your leverage... he leveraged in the night.
<DrDoom> I know from some of the levers and from issuing some leverage in my time.
<Bjornfot> somepony should make a Leverage PMV
<RainBroDash> 10no sprinkles, I mean regardless of your ability to change name in chat
<Captain_of_the_Ship> A DEMON. A MONSTER.
<Darf14> IM ACTING!
<SirSprinkles> 6RAWR!
<RainBroDash> 10that affects none of it
<Hipster_Brony> is there a way we can put exceptions on mods?
<HeavyMetalPony> yeah
<thetrollside> TILTING
<Skor423> XD
<DrDoom> Such large hammed acting
<Elky> I don't even know what I'm watching
<DrDoom> MAN GREW SELFISH
<Dashite> TILTING IS WINNING
<RainBroDash> 10unless you use a command to neutralise the ghost that's hogging your name, but most people don't
<SirSprinkles> 6Likely not.
<HeavyMetalPony> Bleeeeeeegh
<Captain_of_the_Ship> SWINGING
<DrDoom> THINKING HE HAD LEVERAGE AGAISNST DEMOSN
<DrDoom> AND GODS
<Captain_of_the_Ship> was that a straight shot
<Darf14> Looks like I have to tilt the monitor to view the movie straight
<Srake_The_Grimdark> Is mlp cannon in Battlefield earth?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, but we all know the command, so...
<DrDoom> Yes.
<Elky> my head hurts from tilting
<Skor423> O noes.
<prince-dari> Dat leveraged camera angle.
<HeavyMetalPony> No internet in future?
<SirSprinkles> 6And if not, not hard to get it.
<Srake_The_Grimdark> Awesome
<DrDoom> It should be.
<RainBroDash> 10Yarp, I know the command too
<Ghosties> 4Trust me
<Elky> my neck, to be exact
<Skor423> XD
*Dermathil sets an automatic rocket lawnchair turret for while he is gone.
<Ghosties> 4There's a shit ton of screen tilting
<Ghosties> 4in this film
<DrDoom> Look at the leveraged from the music score
<Sol> Ghosties: the number of times leverage is said in the film or the chat?
<Dashite> Like 90% of the film is tilted.
<Ghosties> 4Film
<Captain_of_the_Ship> there are fewer normal shots than tilted ones
*Ray cries
<Ghosties> 4Sol
<Ray> 02WHY
<Ray> 02WHY
<HeavyMetalPony> This screen tilting needs...
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<thetrollside> in the year 3000 bronies will have taken over the earth by then, this movie is WAY too inaccurate
<Ghosties> 4I'll be keeping count
<Darf14> Fun Fact: Derpy was the camera Pony for this film
<Skor423> This movie requires more Tilting.
<Ray> 02Sign 99% acc
<HyperMetalLugia> YHW?
<Ray> 021 MISTAKE
<Captain_of_the_Ship> Derpy isn't actually blind, she sees things more than us
<Ray> 02Almost FC ;-;
<Sol> OK, because if it was the chat, you'd have your work cut out for you XD
<Bjornfot> The director must have had a tilting fetish...
<HeavyMetalPony> Why isn't this movie upside down yet?
<Quanyails> 7Well, I've just resetted for a Bold Dream Lileep with Max HP and 28-29 Sp. Def.
<DrDoom> Camera needs more leverage to get regular shots
<Captain_of_the_Ship> if we were to look through her eyes
<Captain_of_the_Ship> it would look something like this
<Dashite> You require additional Tilt!
<Ghosties> 4Haha, I know :P
<NightSeas> !say !quotes
<junh1024-XD> !quotes

<RainBroDash> 10I was afk momentarily, and then suddenly the fic started almost getting mowed down by the floods
*PizzaPony stops by the apple farm to deliver pizza and notices a strange pile of paper on the ground. He hears two fillies yelliing about something. He picks up the story, reading the title. 'A Pizza Party'. Hmm, I wonder what it's about? He starts reading. As the two fillies notice him, his face is ablaze. He drops the pizza and runs when he sees them.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've heard of RNG and it sounds like a lot of work |D
<WhatPayne> I'd like to read the whole thing as a whole on one sitting too..
<RainBroDash> 10so I was like OH SHIT OH SHIT frantically saving each line just before it got lost off the top of the chat
<RainBroDash> 10phew.

<MrPoniator> John Travolta paid to be part of this movie

<Captain_of_the_Ship> fun fact: this movie didn't use about 4 million of its budget

<Captain_of_the_Ship> or something
<Drake> 04Ohey PS

<Darf14> Chicken little was right! The sky is falling
<Drake> 04Haven't seen you on here for a while
<Pixel64> I thought you would only pay to not be asked to act in this movie, that has to be a slap in the face or something
<Icy> your dead
<Hipster_Brony> and this will make it WAY more convenient for holding the lottery
<DrDoom> nah they used an expensive set
<Skor> Dat sound.

<Link> the 3DS price in that pic has ranged between anything from 159.99 to 229.99

<Light_Latias> 12wow...
<Light_Latias> 12Chime
<DSNesmith> ya'll still here?
<Chimera> 04?
<Ziltoid> 6eeyup
<Polarfire> i've never seen a tornado in person.
<Light_Latias> 12I did something worse than you
<DSNesmith> sillies
<Nittany_Tiger__> Happened on the same day as the Joplin monster. It was a storm in central OK.
<Light_Latias> 12and because he's lonely
<Chimera> 04orly
<Light_Latias> 12yah
<Chimera> 04worse than not saving?
<Light_Latias> 12I ran through the-ayup
<Chimera> 04and :c that's why he's so blue
<Polarfire> But I've been in one of the pre-tornado rotation thing. Its surreal.
*Chimera FELES
<Nittany_Tiger__> Oh yeah.
<Chimera> 04ran through the...
<Light_Latias> 12da-ba-dee-da-ba-da
<Nittany_Tiger__> Wall cloud?
<Nittany_Tiger__> Funnel?
<Light_Latias> 12I ran through the Shadow Temple
<Chimera> 04.
<Light_Latias> 12again
<Chimera> 04AND YOU DIDN'T SAVE
<Chimera> 04OWCH
<Light_Latias> 12to find a key
<Polarfire> Everything gets super still around you even though you can look out and see other trees moving. Then the wind picks up really bad.
<Chimera> 04wait
<Chimera> 04oh
<Chimera> 04you had it
<Chimera> 04already
<Light_Latias> 12to open the final door before the Boss room
<Chimera> 04that IS worse
<Light_Latias> 12no
<Chimera> 04oh?
<Light_Latias> 12the door was ALREADY UNLOCKED
<Chimera> 04.......
<Chimera> 04BAHAHAHAHA
<Polarfire> the rotation passed right over me but luckily no real tornado.
<Light_Latias> 12no key needed
<Chimera> 04That fails
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> lollol
<Nittany_Tiger__> Tornadoes can be down w/o the funnel touching down.
<Light_Latias> 12THAT was the original OoT in my mind
<Chimera> 04time to get big bass sward
<Chimera> 04:3
<Chimera> 04and k
<Light_Latias> 12that door to get to the penultimate room
<Light_Latias> 12needed a key in the original
<Chimera> 04so the final door is unlocked
<Light_Latias> 12:B
<Chimera> 04good
<Bane> really...?
<Nittany_Tiger__> I didn't see the one I caught on video touch down, but I saw the tree damage it did.
<Chimera> 04see this is the bad part of Nintendo's Master Quest
<Bane> that's interesting
<Chimera> 04Locked doors should remain locked so people don't go insane
<Chimera> 04like you XD
<Nittany_Tiger__> Tornadoes are not defined by the funnel.
<Light_Latias> 12@-@
<Polarfire> hmm. have you guys seen those water-tornadoes?
<Nittany_Tiger__> Which is called the condensation funnel.
<Ziltoid> 6oh god I saw this

<Roman500> a yogscast podcast has a good example of larping
<SilverMane> although King's Rule larps use hit=delimb/kill style combat
<rubenflonne> i would be using a teaser if i was playing with my D&D friends
<rubenflonne> if of course we act our the scene which is rare at all
<SilverMane> you know, since I have a bunch of larp friends, we could actually do that for any d&d games

<drf|laptop> 03A friend of mine was visiting a college, which had those security call boxes every few hundred feet. If you were wandering around the campus at night and felt uneasy about somebody following you, for instance, you could hit the button and have a security officer come investigate immediately.
<drf|laptop> 03On one of these phones hung a sign that said, "Out of Order."
<drf|laptop> 03Underneath it someone had scrawled. . . "Keep Running!"
<Roman500> who has that kind of cash for larping gear?
<SilverMane> oh only 4k, nothing to worry bout. i can get that in a few days. sure. yeah. /sarcasm
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolwat
<rubenflonne> who has any money for that really
<Roman500> oh no

<drf|laptop> 03He now lives happily ever after in Redmond, Wash., writing error messages for Microsoft.
<rubenflonne> *shoots myself*
<prince-leverage> We watched the whole spider film earlier.
<SilverMane> that is for SCA, which is hardcore realism with dangerous, hard rubber weapons. You can break bones in that combat

<drf|laptop> 03"Yes," answered the policeman.

<Polarfire> so is larping an all day thing?
<SilverMane> at Kanar, plate is pretty popular. leather is most common though, for cost and lightness
<rubenflonne> depends really
<Lolipop_of_Doom> 14Wait
<Lolipop_of_Doom> 14Did Twilight Say that?
<Roman500> how expensive is LARPing?
<Lolipop_of_Doom> 14loop
<SilverMane> for the most part, from what I've seen, Larping is a friday-Sunday thing, sometimes longer, sometimes a one day
<Lolipop_of_Doom> 14loop AGAIN
<SilverMane> in Michigan, typically 25-30 an event, for rental fees or food
<Roman500> really?
<SilverMane> I've seen a 50/3day game, but that covers a 10 dollar food fee, and that is very worth it
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Lolipop_of_Doom> 14Go to Equestria Daily
<drf|laptop> 03yeah that's where I was pasting them from
<Bane> Is there like a rigid plastic material that you use? I feel like LARP weapons would be kinda flimsy
<rubenflonne> that sounds fun
<Roman500> it does...

<prince-leverage> I've checked.
<prince-leverage> Stream volume's full.
<rubenflonne> jacky weakness is a room that is domed and no furniture in it
<SilverMane> larp weapons that are purchased typically use fiber glass cores or use a material that is rigid in masas
<SilverMane> home-made weapons often use fiber glass rods and PVC piping
<prince-leverage> >Implying Jackie Chan has any weaknesses
<SilverMane> gravity?
<rubenflonne> he is a master but dood, think about how his fighting style works
<rubenflonne> and PVC pipe is common back when you where a kid

<rubenflonne> that sounds about average price
<rubenflonne> the armor is hard to make
<rubenflonne> regardless of how light you make it
<SilverMane> that suit is actually worth it, if bought piece-by-piece it would be more expensive
<Bane> If I was making tons of money I'd spend it on stuff like that
<rubenflonne> also depends on the price of the metals
<rubenflonne> like in the market
<junh1024-XD> XVX is a mac audio warez cracking group
