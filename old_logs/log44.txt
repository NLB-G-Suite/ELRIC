<Shizzyt> <3
<Soarin> sounds like you guys need to drink some decent beer
<prince-dari> I learned that gin and champagne is a nice drink.
<R-Zack> Silverscreen, hah
<Soarin> not the piss they sell in America
<Elision> bah
<TGPFluttershy> Guiness
<Aeroslash> I remember that XDD
*SilverMane hates the taste of most alcohols, and knows he would be an alcoholic if he started.
<prince-dari> Mixed together.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Silver: beer sucks
<R-Zack> I first taste beer when I was 9.
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster: No shit. XD
<Apokalipse> I like wine
<insertcupcake> guiness is alright i guess
<charmin> me too
<maxaminusone1> Don't shit on oat soda, Hipster.
<R-Zack> Never did again for a while after
<DonAngel> TGPFluttershy can barely hold apple cider :P
<charmin> wine
<Elky> wine is okay
<maxaminusone1> I miss it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Beer is horrid. I love vodka, rum, and whisky.
<Shizzy> I'm about the same R-Zack
<TGPFluttershy> How dare you, DonAngel
<Soarin> English beer is just as bad
<charmin> white wine
<Dermathil> Silvermane: same. I get drunk way too easily for my taste, and I find alcohol to taste sour.
<insertcupcake> wine is great
<Soarin> German beer or gtfo
<SirSprinkles> 6WhiskeyXSirSprinkles=OTP
<Elky> i live in germany and hate beer
<Skylands> 10:<
<Shizzy> blasphemy
<Hipster_Brony> 8Sprinkles: i am getting more and more convinced that we are the same person
<BronyWithACrowbar> Germans know how to drink.
*Silverscreen 11wants to do the Pony Drinks for his 21st birthday.
<Soarin> doing it wrong, Elky :S
<SilverMane> i am far too introspective to be healthy, and things that allow me to escape myself are extremely addicting.
<SirSprinkles> 6...I think we may be, Hipster.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> transformers 3 was very patriotic though, SPOILER- they fight from a space bridge in D.C., where megatron shoots Lincon off the chair and sits in it himself
<SilverMane> like ponies
<Bjornfot> i still don't get why people drink Ethanol
<Dermathil> MEDIC
*TGPFluttershy already did some of the pony drinks, Silverscreen
<R-Zack> I also find alcohol to taste sour.
<Elky> >inb4 hipster/sprinkles shipping
<SilverMane> were they any good, TGPFluttershy?
<BronyWithACrowbar> Buy some of those pony shot glasses, then your alcohol will be 20% cooler.
<Silverscreen> 11TGPFluttershy: they any good?
<Silverscreen> 11Silvermane: Herdmine
<HuffytheMagicDragon> yup
<TGPFluttershy> Really depends on what you like.
<Shizzy> only if it's an RBD glass
<Silverscreen> 11herdmind*
<TGPFluttershy> Nightmare Moon is really hard, for example
<Elky> I tried the Applejack one, it was horrible
<Bjornfot> C2H6O is serious shit
<Silverscreen> 11makes sense.
<TGPFluttershy> Fluttershy flows down smoothly
<SilverMane> lol, herdmine is funny concept
<HuffytheMagicDragon> isn't it just RD
<Bjornfot> stop poisoning your bodies
<TGPFluttershy> Dj Pon-3 is very interesting
<Hipster_Brony> 8the only difference between us, Sprinkles, is that i would replace whiskey with gin
<Hipster_Brony> 8also: weirdest blade guy
<Tyranico> Imma leavin. Going to A&W
<SilverMane> anyone wanna drink some Methal-Alcohol?
<SirSprinkles> 6I drink Gin, when I can.
<TGPFluttershy> But I really liked the Twilight
<BronyWithACrowbar> DJ P0n-3=DJ Pwn-3
<R-Zack> Meh, I prefer not to drink alcohol, anyways.
<Tyranico> Bye errypony
<Silverscreen> 11I heard Vodka burns like a mofo.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> seya
<Elky> good gin is pretty nice too
<insertcupcake> bye
<prince-dari> Gin + champagne > just gin
<TGPFluttershy> Silverscreen, yes it does.
<charmin> later
<SirSprinkles> 6I haven't had enough kinds of Gin to honestly say whether I like it in general or not.
<Elky> later tyranico
<Shizzy> if you really want to get drunk.. 99% is the way to go
<R-Zack> DJ Pwn-3 sounds more like a Battle Bot.
<Bjornfot> Hexanol=Best alcohol
<charmin> trolololo
<BronyWithACrowbar> lol Yeah it does.
<Soarin> Juuuuden
<SilverMane> fuck, Hexanol is real?
<Hipster_Brony> 8Silver: its not that bad
<prince-dari> I had this coctail with gin, coconut cream and sprite in it, it was really good.
<Sol> Butanol is best
<Elky> also, gin tonic is probably the best drink effort/taste wise
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not that bad if you get good Vodka.
<Hipster_Brony> 8worst ive had is 151
<Sol> not Hexanol
<TGPFluttershy> Captain Coke
<SirSprinkles> 6If you get the cheap stuff it's horrible.
<Bjornfot> uhh yeah silvermane of course it is
<Hipster_Brony> 8that physically hurt going down
<SilverMane> 151 proof? Damn, 75%
<SirSprinkles> 6I will NEVER drink Vladimir again.
<SirSprinkles> 6EVER.

<Hipster_Brony> 8Ron Diaz rum, thats classy stuff right there XD
*SilverMane copies notes
<TGPFluttershy> I've tried Abstinthe the other day.
<SirSprinkles> 6Smirnoff is usually quite smooth.
<TGPFluttershy> Extremely overrated.
<drf|laptop> 03I can't hear anything LL, just a bunch of scratchy noises

<charmin> FUBAR
<BronyWithACrowbar> Cocaine is a helluva drug.
<Silverscreen> 11How about Everclear?
<GoldenDragon> FUBAR!
<TGPFluttershy> Not the ones they sell at Bevmo, that's for sure.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> called REAL STEEL
<SilverMane> Pinkie Pie is a helluva drug
<SirSprinkles> 6Everclear is... FAWK
<charmin> shut up
<Hipster_Brony> 8everclear is...
<TGPFluttershy> Yeah! that's the one I need to try!
<charmin> soldier
<R-Zack> SilverMane, wait,what?
<BronyWithACrowbar> Pinkiecaine is a helluva drug.
<prince-dari> Limonchello is another drink I like.
<Bjornfot> you can link as many coals as you want in a chain
<SirSprinkles> 6Everclear is illegal in some states. It's just that strong.
<Light_Latias> 12then I don't know >.<
<R-Zack> Cool?
<Elky> no bjornfot, there's a finite amount of matter in the universe
<Elky> *trollface*
<charmin> i still like mojitos
<Elision> be friends everypony
<Skysprite> Everclear is great if you like spending time in the bathroom
<TGPFluttershy> I've seen it in Cali.
<drf|laptop> 03headsets hate you
<Bjornfot> >implying you can't make more matter
<Light_Latias> 12you think >_>
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i went by a dog tag machine on the boardwalk and almost made a brony themed one for myself
<Elky> let's say energy then
<Hipster_Brony> 8fun fact: everything above 60 proof is illegal where i live
<BronyWithACrowbar> Has anybrony ever eaten a Ghost Chili?
<SirSprinkles> 6That sucks Hipster.
<SilverMane> oh hell no, not going near no ghost chilli
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't drink below 70 proof.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i had a ghost chili once
<Hipster_Brony> 8never again
<R-Zack> Ghost chilis are some mean sons of girl dogs.
<Bjornfot> fun fact: in Sweden, the government has monopoly on selling alcohol
<charmin> i want to drink a 4 loko
<charmin> someday
<SilverMane> can barely stand basic chili levels
<BronyWithACrowbar> The afterheat is horrible.
<SirSprinkles> 6I've had a 4 loko, pretty good.
<R-Zack> I think an indian woman did a world record to eat as many Ghost peppers as she can
<Elky> I heard alcohol is rather pricey in sweden?
<charmin> cool
<prince-dari> How many?
<Hipster_Brony> 8 4 loko tasted like drinking a battery to me
<Bjornfot> oh yes it is elky
<Silverscreen> 11Poor Noobs.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I loved ghost chili the one time I had it... but I'm weird like that.
<Bjornfot> but we don't have any other choice
<SilverMane> you drank a battery?
<Bjornfot> that's why they can set the price as high as they want
<Dermathil> HEY, now that I think about it. Anybody seen Ghosties?
<Elky> to drown the sorrows of the long winter nights
<Dermathil> GHOSTIES AIN'T THERE!?
<SilverMane> Giggle at the Ghosties...
<Sol> We giggled at him
<Elky> no price is too high
<HuffytheMagicDragon> I bought a two VHS set special edition of this at a yard sale
<BronyWithACrowbar> I giggle at them for teh lulz.
<SirSprinkles> 6But my sense of taste has forever been destroyed by drinking a gallon of Vladimir over the timespan of a week.
<SkaFox64> I love the mountains... I love the clear blue skies...
<prince-dari> Ghosties is out with a friend or something.
<Silverscreen> 11Hanks just flipped his lid.
<R-Zack> SilverMane, that only works when your fear are not confirmed, like if you see an unusual shadow..
<SilverMane> Where is Harvey dent. Harvey Dent, you seen him, you know who he is?
<Bjornfot> for cheap alcohol, we just cross the border to either Denmark of Finlans
<Hipster_Brony> 8Sprinkles: wat
<Elky> I miss ghosties
<SirSprinkles> 6NEVER. AGAIN.
<Bjornfot> *or Finland, what the hay
<Dermathil> ah, thanks prince-dari
<R-Zack> SPEAK UP SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR
<Elky> homicidal mods are always fun
<Hipster_Brony> 8when alcohol is measured in gallons...
<insertcupcake> you need to walk to the zoo?
<BronyWithACrowbar> HOLY CRAP She ate 60 ghost chilis in two minutes. JEEZ
<HuffytheMagicDragon> yo theres mad lightning wher i live
<prince-dari> I tried all the coctails they had on the menu when I was on holiday, everything with coconut cream in tastes nice. Without fail.
<R-Zack> Crowbar, ikr, even I couldn't eat something that fast.
<charmin> ? ! ? !
<R-Zack> An average of every 2 seconds!
<R-Zack> A ghost chili
<SirSprinkles> 6We had a rule in the house, no buying any alcohol when there was still some in the house... so we had to drink a gallon of Vladimir.
<Elky> ugh
<SirSprinkles> 6I chugged a quart of it just to get rid of it.
<Sol> Great acting in this movie
*SilverMane shudders
<RainBroDash2> oh lawdy
<R-Zack> How did she not become a sort of Flaming superhero from it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8my brother and i both tried a ghost chili once, he rubbed his eye afterwards
<SirSprinkles> 6THREW UP SO MUCH.
<BronyWithACrowbar> :O Wow.
<prince-dari> Lol Sprinkles, did it seem like a good idea at the time?
<Soarin> oh damn
<HuffytheMagicDragon> dat compass
<BronyWithACrowbar> NOT A GOOD IDEA.
<Elky> I can't bring myself to throw away the cheap vodka
<Soarin> that eye must have exploded twice
<maxaminusone1> I once took a bottle of Dave's Gourmet Insanity sauce to school as a prank.
<Silverscreen> 11DAAAAAMN, Sprinkles.
<SirSprinkles> 6To get that stuff out of the house, it was worth it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles: my mom would kill me if she knew i drank underage
<Elky> but I'd never drink that much of it
<SirSprinkles> 6Tasted like charcoal.
<JABgamer> umm... Hi
<Soarin> i once rubbed my eye after cutting a regular chili without knowing what I do, shit was not pleasant
<HuffytheMagicDragon> HAI!

<SilverMane> my parents pretty much gave me permission to drink, as long as I didn't leave the house and took all the vocal abuse in the morning that my hangover would give me
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, i once had to drink half a bottle of white label scotch before we could open a new bottle
<JABgamer> So what we talking about?
<Hipster_Brony> 8that was an interesting night
<SilverMane> alcohol and peppers

<RainBroDash2> Hipster_Brony my friend bought pure capsaicin (the active component in chillis that makes them spicy) dissolved in vodka, then dipped a pencil in it and thrust it in my mouth while I was concentrating on a game of starcraft. Face blew up like a balloon and I accidentally touched one of my eyes, went blind in it for a little bit
<Dermathil> WATCHOUT ITS A TARP

<Elision> derpy has the most boring character design :|
<SilverMane> Lyra and BonBon are always seen together in the show, and they are assumed to be best friends
<BronyWithACrowbar> @DetectiveBrony: I love you.

<Hipster_Brony> 8Elision: TROLOLOLOLOLO
<Nittany_Tiger> Because of the bad rep of 4chan
<Elision> it was Fireant in #eqd
<Hipster_Brony> 8Nittany: it's NOTHING like 4chan
<MidnightLuna> Ive never been on Ponychan
<Elky> it's a fun place
<Hipster_Brony> 8literally the exact opposite
<letmechangemyname> agreed
<Nittany_Tiger> A) I hate porn.
<MidnightLuna> And im probably never gonna due to fear of Rule 34
<Silverscreen> 11Nittany: Do explain. What kind of Rep?
<charmin> no, dude, ponychan isn't fun
<Hipster_Brony> 8no porn on Ponychan

<Elision> I didn't care, it took me 12 hours to notice
<Bjornfot> WTH
<Elky> I like to visit /sci/, people get trolled there pretty easily
<Silverscreen> 11Ponychan is strict on it's PG-13 policy
<Soarin> ponychan is like 4chan, but replace anything bad with love, tolerance and PONY
<Silverscreen> 11its*
*MidnightLuna Thanks hipster_brony
<Sol> 0 34 isn't that bad, you just ignore it after a while
<Elky> and ponychan is cool, but it can get annoying at times
<MidnightLuna> Who doesnt love pony?
<Sol> 0 4Chan
<TGPFluttershy> Ponies make the world go round
<Elision> the key is to realize that there is no limit to how horrible the internet can be
<Pikaru> Gonna go on topic. The most epic army scene in history. Though I haven't seen many army movies to begin with.
<charmin> FiM chan FTW

<Dashite> They turned their backs on all of pony kind.
<SirSprinkles> 6I am infact, here.
<sklar> 0Fallout equstria is awsome

<Guest12540> 03wtf

<drf|laptop> 03it seems something's been acting up
<sklar> 0sileance across the land
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Dashite> Oh noes!
<sklar> 0that would be the worst ending ever but somehow satisfying to know how kickass humans are
<Ascendant> haha trolling #computerhope on mibbit
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
<Ascendant> [13:43:04] <jcheung> .....is there a way to ignore or block or boot in this chat?
<Ascendant> [13:43:22] <Archfiend> jcheung, try /ignore *!*@*
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<sklar> 0Its actually kinda cool because were actually beginning to make such things as lasers and railguns
<SirSprinkles> 6LIES! ALL LIES!
<sklar> 0Although not ready for real use but are laser would simply not need any ammo at all in fact it could just keep on firing
<prince-dari> Hey, Sprinkles.
<SirSprinkles> Hey, dari
<sklar> 0Sirsprinkles its not lies look it up or on youtube the navy has a pretty good video for it
<prince-dari> So I'm adapting Silver's layout to add CSS.
<SirSprinkles> 6...I know, I'm not allowed to make an Austin Powers reference now?
<SirSprinkles> 6Seriously?
<SirSprinkles> ...nice.
<sklar> 0Oh SORRy:D
<prince-dari> Also I got the domain name.
<SirSprinkles> Also nice.
<drf|laptop> 03oh wow @ this episode
<SirSprinkles> btw, when we switch to that, I need to make sure I get it run through and approved by the firewall company, so we'd have to wait probably a few days before switching.
<drf|laptop> 03FBI traitors
<prince-dari> What, every new site need approval? Wow. O_o
<prince-dari> needs*
<sklar> 0though the railgun is just awesome looking although it is a fucking semi long though but still it gonna be what maybe 20 30 years before the practical one
<SirSprinkles> Basically, otherwise it comes up as "unrated" and gets blocked.
<Dashite> Mods aren't allowed to have a sense of humour. I'm pretty sure it's hidden in your contract.
<Ascendant> ._.
<sklar> ha
<prince-dari> So the only way to get it rated is to have it approved?
<SirSprinkles> It's a big name firewall company though, so they approve thousands of requests a day, if not more.
<SirSprinkles> Pretty much.
<prince-dari> Meh.
<prince-dari> How come you could view the site when I hosted it from my IP?
<SirSprinkles> I can't here.
<Dashite> It's supposed to be surgically removed along with your sense of compassion and the ability to feel empathy for those under you.
<SirSprinkles> I was at a different wifi.
<sklar> yeah railguns
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Aeroslash> night all
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<prince-dari> You should bypass their firewall with tor. :P
<sklar> Dashite SirSprinkles is actually pretty cool guy
<SirSprinkles> 6Our humor is actually ramped up in a trolling sense, when we undergo the surgery, Dashite.
<sklar> Although his life is shit as far i as can see
<Light_Latias> 12nini~
<SirSprinkles> I've tried. So many things. >>;
<drf|laptop> 03oh wow that was kinda an emotional ending
<Dashite> Ah, I guess I had your agreements confused with those of a forum I frequent. Carry on then!
<prince-dari> I'm fairly sure there's no way to stop you from bypassing with tor unless they block tor/the tor port.
<V1RU5> And Nexus is like 2.30 GB! For FREE!!!
<SirSprinkles> No idea what tor is... but it's a big company, so it may be blocked.
<SirSprinkles> 6And yeah, sklar, it kinda is.
*Shiny-Growlithe curls up
<prince-dari> It's an onion router program.
<sklar> But were here for you on the weekands and whenever else can you
<SirSprinkles> Hmm...
<SirSprinkles> may have to get it.
<sklar> i ca find you
<Dashite> Why do I still have this so small? Not like I need to keep the video on screen now.
*Light_Latias 12cuddles Shiny
<SirSprinkles> Would it allow me to play my MMO's?
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Dashite> Now I can read that purple text!
<prince-dari> You could get another program to route the MMO through tor, I think that would work.
<prince-dari> Doing that might make you lag on the MMO though.
<SirSprinkles> Hmm... may have to do this...
<sklar> Well SirSprinkles yah just gotta keep on going right
<SirSprinkles> >implying lag isn't normal on the MMO anyway
<prince-dari> Lawl
<SirSprinkles> 6What doesn't kill me and whatnot
<sklar> Exactly
<sklar> And then there was nothing
<sklar> but silence
<sklar> of course theres me so not really
<Dashite> Augh, how did I not see that before.
<sklar> See what
<Bane> Hey guys, I'm back. Hi Sprinkles!

<kir13> yeah but only the us has used them, not to mention it was a shameful attack
<Aurora> 6there's something gross about swimming in a 87F pool in weather like this
<Aurora> 6not comfy at all

<NightSeas> 1222 c :3
<drf|laptop> 03<Aurora> there's something gross about swimming in a 87F pool in weather like this <- LOL WTF 87 degree pool
<sklar> I get we drop one but that prevented the war from strecthing out into a more bloody battle costing more than just a couple hundred thousand i know that sounds cruel but its true
<Ascendant> hopefuly it's not coppermine :x
<Ascendant> hopefully*
<Articuno> 12Why hopefully?
<Aurora> 6drf, that's what happened to my pool, because of the weather
<Ascendant> well not hopefully
<Articuno> 12and you asked me this before, it IS Coppermine
<Aurora> 6the sun heated it up so much
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<Ascendant> oh I have? .-.
<Ascendant> well, coppermine gets annoying
<drf|laptop> 03so the temperature regulation didn't make it colder?
<drf|laptop> 03that being said
<Aurora> 6anyways though
<drf|laptop> 03pour ice in it
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6I should
<Articuno> 12Why is it annoying? ovO
<Ascendant> the interface is worse than PHPBB's admin panel
<drf|laptop> 03juts go empty the freezer
<drf|laptop> 03like the tray of ice
<drf|laptop> 03dump it all in there
<sklar> Plus if we didn't make a treaty with them japan would have been fair game for russia
<drf|laptop> 03it might help
<Articuno> 12You talking about the old Coppermine? lol
<Ascendant> actually, PHPBB's admin panel is worse
<Ascendant> yeah the old one
<Aurora> 6I'm tempted to-
<Aurora> 6wait
<Ascendant> haven't really used it for quite some time
<Articuno> 12the new one is fine ^^
<Aurora> 6I can turn the hose on
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Aurora> 6that's some freaking cold water
<drf|laptop> 03that too
<Aurora> 6"I'm filling up the pool dad"
<drf|laptop> 03drain some of the water and then fill it up with the hose?
<Aurora> 6and if it's too full, I'll dump some
<Aurora> 6...
<drf|laptop> 03drain it
<Aurora> 6yeh
<drf|laptop> 03right?
<kir13> maybe but there is the fact that killing all those civilians was not really a fair move
<drf|laptop> 03I want a pool XD
<Aurora> 6not all of it
<Aurora> 6but enough
<drf|laptop> 03my mom refuses to get one
<Aurora> 6this is horrible
<Ascendant> ah
<drf|laptop> 03because of liability
<drf|laptop> 03like
<Ascendant> I'll test it out
<drf|laptop> 03if some kid were to wander into our yard
<Articuno> 12Eep, need to make a backup of the DB..
<drf|laptop> 03and drown
<drf|laptop> 03their parents could sue it
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<drf|laptop> 03*sue us
<sklar> Yeah i know
<Ascendant> looool Arti, I haven't done a proper backup for like...a year
<NightSeas> 12I’ve been starting to not like cold weather ; ;
<Articuno> 12:/
<Ascendant> I'm that lazy
<SirSprinkles> 6>killing civilians isn't fair
<Articuno> 12That thankfully doesn't happen in this country but people are already trying it DRF
<Ascendant> wat
<Ascendant> seriously, drf?
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<Aurora> 6um
<Ascendant> ._.
<drf|laptop> 03that's how america works
<SirSprinkles> 6I've read MUCH worse war crimes by other countries that just were dismissed because it wasn't OMFG A NUKE
<drf|laptop> 03it's like how if you rob someone's house and hurt yourself, you can sue them
<kir13> anyway war is bad and in a better world there should not be military
<Ascendant> was
<Aurora> 6 00:20	drf|laptop	their parents could sue it <-that goes for EVERYONE
<drf|laptop> 03I should do that, I need money
*drf|laptop runs
<Ascendant> awt
<Ascendant> wat
<Ascendant> .-.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, Arti
<Aurora> 6that's why there are regulations about gate/fence security
<Aurora> 6strict ones
<drf|laptop> 03ever heard of a show called Fit and Fearless?
<Aurora> 6I didn't even know how strict
<drf|laptop> 03It made this G4 program
<SirSprinkles> 6There will never be a world without war.
<drf|laptop> 03on world's sexiest TV shows
<SirSprinkles> 6War is a necessary turmoil.
<drf|laptop> 03nobody ask why I'm watching it ;p
<Ascendant> !efg America
<Aurora> 6the gate has to swing out, there needs to be a latch, and an inside lock
*ScriptBot turns America into the Epic Fail Guy
<SilverSonic> i love cold weather
<Aurora> 6certain distance from the pool
<Aurora> 6etc
<Ascendant> lol I need to remove that
<SilverSonic> o_o
<kir13> there is no war in equestria
<sklar> Yeah but think about it without war we would have over populated a long time ago
<SilverSonic> God dammit mirc
<Ascendant> !snowball Articuno
<SilverSonic> *kicks it*
*ScriptBot throws a snowball at Articuno
<Articuno> 12haven';t seen it no

*ScriptBot throws a snowball at Ascendant
*ScriptBot throws a large fireball at SilverSonic
<kir13> jejeje
<Ascendant> lolol
<Articuno> 12But Hmm, the law to beat the crap outa burglars here is being strengthened :3
<NightSeas> 12!snowball Articuno
*ScriptBot throws a snowball at Articuno
<Ascendant> timing haha
<SilverSonic> Fire and Ice dont mix
<drf|laptop> 03Articuno
<SilverSonic> neither do water and oil
<Articuno> 12If a burglar comes in, you're allowed to kick the crap outa them till they leave or even kill them if they're trying to kill you
<Aurora> 6I like that law lol
<drf|laptop> 03you know what the stupidest thing is
<Articuno> 12What?
<drf|laptop> 03that police officers in the UK can't have guns
<Aurora> 6but something like that is allowed here
<drf|laptop> 03I'm like
<Ascendant> that's cool, Articuno
<Ascendant> much better than most places
<Ascendant> >|
<sklar> And alot of our technology came from wars or at least competitions
<drf|laptop> 03bad guys --> don't follow laws --> will have guns anyway
<drf|laptop> 03so if the cops can't have guns
<Articuno> 12We don't need guns
<Aurora> 6basically, if they intrude, that's potential life threat
<drf|laptop> 03all that does is make them die
<Articuno> 12But some do have them
<Aurora> 6so you can use defensive force
<Aurora> 6even if it's deadly
<Articuno> 12we have other weapons
<sklar> Like say the space race between russia and us
<drf|laptop> 03such as
<drf|laptop> 03?
<Ascendant> kung fu fighting!
*Ascendant hides
<drf|laptop> 03tasers have a limit to how far you can shoot them
<Articuno> 12Stun guns, which work fine for most crims here. But.. when police are out of force with dangerous people, they do have guns
<Articuno> 12Like that guy who murdered a load of people then did a runner
<Articuno> 12the police were fully armed XD
<Ascendant> anyway, bbl dinner
<sklar> We thrive when when we have someone to compete with
<drf|laptop> 03well all I read was that the police in the UK couldn't carry gunso.o
<NightSeas> 12Seeya NS
<Light_Latias> bai NS
<Articuno> 12They can't, which is a good thing or we might end up like America shooting every person that moves >v>
<drf|laptop> 03that's totally a stereotype
<Articuno> 12I've seen a million reports AND videos of police using unreasonable force
<drf|laptop> 03every bullet fired from a police's gun has to be documented in an official report
<Articuno> 12Not a stereotype, videos like that come up on Fark all the time :/
<SirSprinkles> 6A lot of tech wouldn't have developed if we didn't develop nuclear warheads, either.
<NightSeas> 12True
<Articuno> 12Yeh and the government always favours the police
<drf|laptop> 03and the officer can get in serious trouble if they shoot someone without just cause
<drf|laptop> 03no they don;'t
<kir13> yeah that is true but still i do belive its possible to live in peace
<Articuno> 12That's so not true
<drf|laptop> 03I happen to respect what the police do though
<Articuno> 12They SAY it was reasonable and are let off all the time
<Light_Latias> Dodge Bullet, Americas newest sport :D
<drf|laptop> 03it's like those people who say they hate cops because they got a speeding ticket
*Light_Latias shot
<drf|laptop> 03I'm like, is it THEIR fault that YOU are breaking the law?
*drf|laptop finds out who shot LL and forces htem to file a report
<Articuno> 12I don't care about stuff like that DRF but when police SHOOT and KILL homeless folk for carring pocket knives to carve wooden sculptures?
<sklar> No it isn't were a naturally violent specis and even if came to peace with ourselves what about more advanced specis
<NightSeas> 12US cops fail sometimes :/
<drf|laptop> 03that's an extreme example
<Zoroark> wat
<drf|laptop> 03let me put it this way
<Articuno> 12but that KEEPS happening
<Articuno> 12I read fark news all the time and every week there's something else XD that jsut DOESNT happen here, ever
<drf|laptop> 03it's the same logic as my mom hearing about a few kids getting raped after talking on chatrooms, and therefore saying chatrooms are dangerous
<drf|laptop> 03all they ever show is the bad stuff
<kir13> we are raised to be violent but we could be raised diferently
<drf|laptop> 03America is a much bigger country than the UK
<drf|laptop> 03For every cop that shoots someone
<drf|laptop> 03there's a few million that dn't
<drf|laptop> 03*don't
<Articuno> 12DRF
<Articuno> 12It doesn't matter how big a country is..
<Aurora> 6wtf kind of statement is that
<Articuno> 12If you take the same area
<Articuno> 12and the same population
<SirSprinkles> 6We're raised to be violent? Really?
<Articuno> 12and count up all the police crimes there..
<Articuno> 12It amounts to the same
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm pretty sure I was punished in school whenever I got in a fight...
<drf|laptop> 03I'm just saying there are a lot more police in the US than there
<Articuno> 12and yes
<Articuno> 12I get what you're saying about it
<drf|laptop> 03so of course there are going to be more that do stupid things
<drf|laptop> 03as more = more
<Aurora> 6I don't like some of the stuff police do around here, but I sure as heck feel alot safer with them being fully armed
<Articuno> 12But still, there are just.. too many reports..
<Articuno> 12One is too many
<drf|laptop> 03if there's anything I've learned
<drf|laptop> 03it's that news ;always exaggerates everything
<SirSprinkles> 6The human psyche works off fight or flight. Everything is a conflict.
<sklar> And besides it wouldn't help in the long run
<drf|laptop> 03every single news anything in existance
<Articuno> 12Videos don't exaggerate
<Bane> Well, good night guys! I'll get out of your hair now
<drf|laptop> 03the only way to get a 100% truthful story is to see it with your own eye
<drf|laptop> 03Articuno
<drf|laptop> 03so are you saying that if you saw a video on Fox news
<drf|laptop> 03that you would believe it?
<kir13> good night
<Aurora> 6LOLfox
<drf|laptop> 03because they show the same sorts of videos as anyone else
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Articuno> 12Depends on what the video is Ovo
<SilverSonic> and plus, theres always edits in the video :P
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I doubt news stations edit their videos
<drf|laptop> 03but I will say this
<SilverSonic> they do :P
<drf|laptop> 03yes, sadly there are a lot of crooked cops in America
<sklar> Its basically essential to know how to wage war and fight if we are to survive with more advance specis when we do hit that time
<drf|laptop> 03but even if the cops weren't allowed to have guns
<kir13> not in that way but we are surrounded by violence so much that we have come to accept it like human nature
<drf|laptop> 03if they're CORRUPTED
<drf|laptop> 03would that stop them from having one?
<drf|laptop> 03I don't think so...
<Aurora> 6I try to think of it this way
<sklar> It is human nature
<Articuno> 12No but
<drf|laptop> 03it's like that statement, passwords only keep honest people out
<Aurora> 6what would crime be like around here if they didn't have guns
<Articuno> 12If they weren't allowed a gun and they had one, they;d probably be in trouble just for that
<sklar> Or why there be so much of it
<Aurora> 6I don't think UK has the same ridiculous amount of crime like we do
<Articuno> 12That's the scary thing About America XD
<Articuno> 12Nope
<drf|laptop> 03Laws are completely stupid if peopole don't follow them
<Aurora> 6so as horrible as it is, I'd rather the police have their guns on them
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly it's not human nature.
<Aurora> 6beesides
<Articuno> 12It's just scary that you need guns
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just nature.
<drf|laptop> 03same here Aurora
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Zoroark> speed limits :3c
<Aurora> 6there's FAAAAR more good cops than bad
<drf|laptop> 03Articuno
<drf|laptop> 03if someone comes up to you with a gun
<drf|laptop> 03and you don't have a gun
<drf|laptop> 03say goodbye
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<sklar> Yeah i agree with you there SirSprinkles
<SirSprinkles> 6That's just the way the foodchain is.
<SirSprinkles> 6Eat or be eaten.
<Articuno> 12Like I said, people here don't have guns XD
<drf|laptop> 03well then that's fine
<Zoroark> on guns i believe gun possession shouldn't be a right
<Articuno> 12Only the gangsters do LOL and you never see them, unless you're involved XD
<drf|laptop> 03but that won't stop bad people from giving them
<sklar> Outsmart or die
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03see
<Aurora> 6in my part of the country
<drf|laptop> 03Rifles or shotguns, sure, I don't care
<drf|laptop> 03as you can actually hunt with those
<kir13> there is a diference between survible and killing to feed yourself and going nuts and killing a bunch of mf's
<drf|laptop> 03BUT WHY THE F*** IS IT LEGAL TO OWN HANDGUNS
<Aurora> 6 4 out of 10 people will have a gun
<Articuno> 12No idea :/
<drf|laptop> 03You can't hunt with a handgun, so all it amounts to is killing people
<Zoroark> i think it should be a privilege
<drf|laptop> 03heck
<Articuno> 12I agree, handguns wtf
<Zoroark> like hunting itself or fishing is certain areas
<Zoroark> in*
<drf|laptop> 03it's legal to own assault rifles too
<drf|laptop> 03which is just stupid
<SilverSonic> x.x i hate gun talk
<Zoroark> need a license
<Articuno> 12LOL Assault rifles XD
<Articuno> 12Sorry SilverSonic
<Articuno> 12change of subject then
<SilverSonic> please
<SilverSonic> ^^;
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|laptop> 03SilverSonic
<drf|laptop> 03I hate MLP talk
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is generally put forward as being wrong in society.
<Articuno> 12I got distracted, need towork
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03no
<Articuno> 12*to work
<drf|laptop> 03so do you
<drf|laptop> 03I hate o3o talk, does that stop you?
*drf|laptop runs
<Zoroark> wait it's legal to own an assault rifle :V
<SilverSonic> ;p
<SilverSonic> o3o nope
<drf|laptop> 03yes it is Zoroark
<junh1024-XD> o3o
<SirSprinkles> 6"going nuts and killing a bunch of mf's" is due to being, well, not sane.
<drf|laptop> 03my uncle has a FEW assault rifles
<kir13> unless you are at war n then u get a medal
<drf|laptop> 03I got to fire one
<drf|laptop> 03that being said it was cool
<Zoroark> well i guess it would be
<drf|laptop> 03but I was like, this feels illegal
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<SirSprinkles> 6No.
<Zoroark> i think it's illegal to carry one
<NightSeas> 12drf, you’re the one who just mentioned MLP XD
<SirSprinkles> 6You get medals for doing the right thing.
<drf|laptop> 03probably
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Articuno> 12MLP >v>
<drf|laptop> 03owning and carrying are separate
<Zoroark> yeah
<Articuno> 12What is there to talk about XD
<drf|laptop> 03THANK YOU ARTICUNIO
<Zoroark> i know
<SilverSonic> drf with a gun infront of a pony...hmm.....
*SilverSonic RUNS
<drf|laptop> 03-I
<drf|laptop> 03People here keep posting links to MLP videos and then get annoyed with half the channel, including me, rages
<junh1024-XD> there is lots to talk about MLP, just like there is about guns & legislation
<SirSprinkles> 6Going batshit and killing those that are unarmed is a war crime.
<NightSeas> 12[01:34] <~Articuno> What is there to talk about XD <-- Sometimes I don’t know XD
<SirSprinkles> 6If they can't fight back, don't fight them, really.
<Aurora> 6I think this MLP stuff is getting horribly annoying
<Zoroark> bronies usually just talk about the same things with ponies added or something
<Articuno> 12Ok well I don't get it XD
<Zoroark> i think
<drf|laptop> 03indeed
<Aurora> 6I didn't realize how consumed the forum is
<Zoroark> i dunno lopl
<Aurora> 6I like it, yes, but I hate how popular it is
<Articuno> 12LOLOL
<drf|laptop> 03also Articuno, I'm surprised you and Xai are so favorable of the Democrats then, because Republicans are the ones who are about limiting things, such as gun rights :P
<SilverSonic> LOL i do have one random question, on the TST home page, that theme music at the bottom, is that custom made? XD
<Zoroark> uh
<Articuno> 12Republicans are pro a lot of things we hate as well XD
<Zoroark> what drf
<Articuno> 12But that's another story
<Articuno> 12It's all about the lesser of two evils remembver that XD
<drf|laptop> 03Yeah
<drf|laptop> 03see
<Articuno> 12All politicians are idiots
<SilverSonic> ^
<drf|laptop> 03I honestly hate all..yeah
<Articuno> 12XD
<Zoroark> drf republicans want less government control :V
<drf|laptop> 03I just tend to agree iwth republicans more
<drf|laptop> 03Zoroark, what
<drf|laptop> 03Republicans are known as liberal, yes?
<drf|laptop> 03liberal = freedom
<sklar> Exactly
<drf|laptop> 03last time I checked
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<kir13> i do see your points but once you actually see all the pointless deads and resources spend on killing you wonder if there is not a better way to live
<Zoroark> uh
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<Zoroark> no?
<drf|laptop> 03Democrats = liberal
<SilverSonic> Arti: who made the theme music for tst XD
<drf|laptop> 03is what I meant
<Zoroark> yeah
<SilverSonic> im kinda curious
<Articuno> 12Though what's annoying me is that our Prime minister is putting out suggestions, getting opinions then changing his mind based on the country's reaction.. and is actually getting slated for changing his mind? ovO
<Articuno> 12People are so dumb, if you force a law onto them they get angry, if you check whether it's ok with them they get angry!
<Articuno> 12WHAT
<SirSprinkles> 6It simply would not happen.
<drf|laptop> 03All I really pay attention to legislation-wise is copyright issues
<drf|laptop> 03and all I know is Obama and Biden are worse copyright lobbyists than nayone we've had before :/
<sklar> I far as i can tell no i guess I've just come to accept that
<SirSprinkles> 6With billions of people in the world one person would eventually turn violent.
<Articuno> 12-v-
<NightSeas> 12Ew Obama
<drf|laptop> 03as much as Bush didn't do anything, he also didn't give in to copyright crap :P
<Zoroark> i guess i'm the same, just whatever gets told to me via the internet
<SirSprinkles> 6And the only way to stop that violent man would be more violence against him.
<drf|laptop> 03let's see, Bill Clinton, Democrat, signed the DMCA
<drf|laptop> 03Bush, republican, nothing
<Articuno> 12It's just another way of leaching money from the country
<drf|laptop> 03Obama, democrat, tons more copyright legislation
<drf|laptop> 03HMMMM
<drf|laptop> 03Now me, being a pirate, who would I logically side with? :P
<Articuno> 12XD
<Articuno> 12The funny thing is
<Light_Latias> as much as he did nothing, he did nothing :B
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<drf|laptop> 03nothing good, notheing bad
<drf|laptop> 03*nothing
<Zoroark> i think i'd much rather vote for obama than any of the republican candidates
<drf|laptop> 03eh
<drf|laptop> 03I hated everybody in the 2008 election LOL
<Articuno> 12It works here too, that our democratic equiv is all pro copyright laws
<sklar> So who thought they ever be having a conversation like this on BMN
<Articuno> 12and yet the conservatives are not really
<Zoroark> i will probably this election
<Aurora> 6yay 2012?
<drf|laptop> 03I hope the Republicans have some really good peopl ein 2012
<drf|laptop> 03because I want someone actually good to vote for
<kir13> maybe humanity is rotten from its core and there is no way to change that but it is nice to try n do better n live in peace
<Aurora> 6speaking of which
<Aurora> 6I should register to vote
<Light_Latias> lol
<Aurora> 6OH YEAH, I hate the voting setup in this country
<drf|laptop> 03and this is one benefit to watching FOX News, since it's a republican channel, they have lots of coverage on the republican candidates
*drf|laptop hides
<drf|laptop> 03Aurora, get this
<drf|laptop> 03I registered to vote to save our local library
<Articuno> 12right back to work
<Zoroark> in my mind it's the lesser of two evils deciding between republicans and democrats, in which case i'd pick dem
<drf|laptop> 03I didn't care about the main elections
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not saying it's rotten.
*SilverSonic Now Playing: Pendulum - Propane Nightmares -Celldweller Remix-
<Aurora> 6see, same would have gone for me
<Zoroark> i hate the way politics is going
<drf|laptop> 03but there was an election about city millage about whether to close the library or not
<Aurora> 6except I was too late
<SilverSonic> love this remix ;3
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a result of escalation.
<drf|laptop> 03and I was like NOOO YOU CAN'T CLOSE THE LIBRARY
<drf|laptop> 03so I registered to vote
<drf|laptop> 03and went and voted
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Aurora> 6I was going to vote about a tax increase to save the schools
<drf|laptop> 03as it is, most people voted against the tax increase -_-
<Aurora> 6a tax increase of like...50 dollars a year
<Aurora> 6WHICH PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST
<drf|laptop> 03so they're having another vote on August 2 as a one last attempt thing to save the library
<Aurora> 6it would have saved our schools majorly
<drf|laptop> 03I'm definitely going and voting agian
<SirSprinkles> 6Things can be handled with civility, but there will inevitably be violence somewhere down the line.
<Aurora> 6and they said no to it >.>
<drf|laptop> 03*again
<drf|laptop> 03because public libraries are a must, IMHO
<drf|laptop> 03and I just can't picture our library closing :/
<Zoroark> i love my public library
<Aurora> 6paying less than 10 dollars a month is horrible apparently
<SirSprinkles> 6It's our way of proving who's the alpha.
<drf|laptop> 03LO
<Aurora> 6if it goes to education
<drf|laptop> 03*LOL:
<Zoroark> even if i never go there
<Articuno> 12Our libraries are closing >v<
<drf|laptop> 03yeah same
<SirSprinkles> 6Most animal species do it, really.
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<drf|laptop> 03screw books
<Aurora> 6I never go, but I don't want them to go
<drf|laptop> 03but our library has free DVD and even Blu-Ray rentals
<Articuno> 12I love libraries
<drf|laptop> 03and that's just plain awesome
<Zoroark> i love books
<Articuno> 12LOL
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just that when we do it we do it with armies of people we've already established dominance over.
<drf|laptop> 03they even do Wii/PS3/Xbox 360 game rentals
<drf|laptop> 03for $5 for 2 weeks
<drf|laptop> 03totally better than anybody else
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Zoroark> i just haven't read any in a while
<Light_Latias> books <3
<sklar> In the end i see everything in gray
<NightSeas> 12Books are awesome :3
<SirSprinkles> 6Things will never be black and white.
<Zoroark> anyway yeah i'd definitely vote for a tax increase if it was going to the right things
<SirSprinkles> 6Everything is more complex than it seems.
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6but people have a negative IQ around here
<SirSprinkles> 6Without the complex chaos, there would be no simple order.
<Articuno> 12Zoroark> anyway yeah i'd definitely vote for a tax increase if it was going to the right things <-- I KNOW RIGHT?
<Aurora> 6that and they're self centered
<Articuno> 12But NOOOOOO we have to spend it all on benefits ://////
<Zoroark> i feel almost too smart here
<drf|laptop> 03people here are all "I DON'T WANT OT PAY MORE"
<drf|laptop> 03*to
<Aurora> 6it's either the people who's children are old and off to college/have no children in the shcools
<Aurora> 6or the people who can't even speak english, which is 20% of my town
<drf|laptop> 03LOL MEXICANS
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6it makes me rage
<Aurora> 6so much
<kir13> maybe if people really thought things throw and there were an end to some peoples greed (cause down the line thats what its all about) a change would be possible
<drf|laptop> 03I would love to see illegal mexicans in michigan
<SilverSonic> >>
<Drake> 04o-o
<SilverSonic> Im half Mexican :P
<Zoroark> i like in a redneck town and i feel almost too smart
<Zoroark> live*
<Aurora> 6I have NOTHING wrong with mexicans alright?
<drf|laptop> 03yeah same here
<SilverSonic> i know ;p
<Aurora> 6I hate the fact we have SO MANY that can not even manage to say hello
<drf|laptop> 03it's ILLEGAL mexicans I hate
<Articuno> 12Who cares if you're half mexican lol, we're talking asbout immigrants
<Aurora> 6when they walk into TARGET, in AMERICA, to buy food
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<SilverSonic> lmao
<Articuno> 12ovO?
<Articuno> 12I don't get that :>
<Light_Latias> lrn English
<drf|laptop> 03what pisses me off
<Aurora> 6what's worse is when their 6 year old daughter needs to translate for them
<Kyro> -_- i just fell asleep on my keyboard -_-
<junh1024-XD> >I would love to see illegal mexicans in michigan
<junh1024-XD> >it's ILLEGAL mexicans I hate
<junh1024-XD> >mfw
<Articuno> 12D:
<drf|laptop> 03is that they have to make packaging bilingual now
<Drake> 04wat
<SirSprinkles> 6This is about to go from a theological discussion to a religious one, so I'd like to stop it before it does.
<Aurora> 6or even worse when their 12 year old son CAN'T SPEAK ENGLISH
<NightSeas> 12[01:43] <%drf|laptop> it's ILLEGAL mexicans I hate <-- Agreed
<Articuno> 12Hmm
<drf|laptop> 03<junh1024-XD> >I would love to see illegal mexicans in michigan <- that was sarcasm
<drf|laptop> 03and beause Michigan is incredibly far from Mexizco
<drf|laptop> 03-z
<drf|laptop> 03the few mexicans I do know are obviously here legally
*Drake walked in on a debate
*junh1024-XD walked in on sarcasm
<Articuno> 12Our Prime Minister doesn't support the whole multi culturalism, he thinks everyone here should just BE British if they're going to live in our country :/
<Aurora> 6if you're going to live in this country
*Drake walked in as a Scout
<Aurora> 6LEARN THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE
<Kyro> lol Drake, just shun it off and let em debate xD
<sklar> Well this is never going to stop if we just don't stop here were all hard-fixed on what we belive so like Sir Sprinkles said lets stop it here before we really start to fight
<Zoroark> in my mind i kind of see it as it's excusable because i would probably be the same if i moved to a different country
<Articuno> 12Which is a good thing in a way, because all the other races are trying to make Britain into something else
<drf|laptop> 03Aurora, techincally we don't have a national language :/
<Aurora> 6I don't mind culture, I mind communication
*Drake rages about some culture and departs
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6you're kidding me
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03look it up
<drf|laptop> 03America has no official language
<Aurora> 6when 995 of the country speaks english-
<Aurora> 6...
<SilverSonic> lolol
<Aurora> 6 99%
<Aurora> 6wth
<Aurora> 6alright well
<Aurora> 6I still stand by this
<SilverSonic> English is mostly our main language drf :P
<kir13> its to late for it anyway... jejeje... we should all try to be more like the ponies lol
<Zoroark> when you get to a certain point in your life it'd be pretty hard to learn a new language
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<Aurora> 6WHY move to america if you can't speak the 99% spoken language
<drf|laptop> 03my sister is traveling in Europe
<SirSprinkles> 6I've had enough arguing for one day anyway.
<drf|laptop> 03and she's staying with English speaking people in Germany
<sklar> wtf is je
<Aurora> 6make an attempt
<Articuno> 12Probably because it['s better than being stuck in their country? XD
<SirSprinkles> 6And it's only quarter of 4.
<drf|laptop> 03I would much rather not the Germans go "GERMAN OR GTFO"
<Zoroark> aurora, because maybe you can have a slightly better life or something?
<Zoroark> :V
<Aurora> 6make an attempt though
<Drake> 04She's travelling
<Drake> 04that's different
<Aurora> 6I went to italy for 3 weeks and did everything i could to learn the language
<NightSeas> 12Hey Drake
<drf|laptop> 03I don't mind people speaking Spanish, but I fricking hate that they're making packaging for things like videogames bilingual
<sklar> also again who thought they would be having a argument like this on BMN
<drf|laptop> 03well, she's 14
<Drake> 04hey night
<Aurora> 6I've forgotten it now, but I was able to hold out minor conversations
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Articuno> 12<drf|laptop> I would much rather not the Germans go "GERMAN OR GTFO" <-- I would rather XD Everyone HAS to speak English for English people, we need to learn to speak other languages LOL
<Aurora> 6enough to get me by
<drf|laptop> 03well
<SirSprinkles> 6Wasn't really an argument so much as a discussion.
<Aurora> 6AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO SAY HELLO, HOW ARE YOU
<drf|laptop> 03the thing is
<Articuno> 12I went to Italy and had to TRY and speak Italian, it was so funny
<drf|laptop> 03she's actually staying at someone's house
<Zoroark> i guess it's inexcusable if they simply don't learn anything, but i'm sure that most people that move here from other countries make valid attempts to learn at least rudimentary engliosh
<drf|laptop> 03it's not like she's in a hotel
<drf|laptop> 03it's part of a band trip
<Zoroark> english*
<Articuno> 12Why is she there?
<sklar> Okay discussion but it was heading that way
<Articuno> 12Ahh
<Drake> 04I tried to speak spanish in Venezuela. Hilarity ensued
<SirSprinkles> 6I just wanted it stopped before it became one.
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Zoroark> >
<drf|laptop> 03fine arts camp
<drf|laptop> 033 week tour in Europe
<Zoroark> >band trip

<Articuno> 12Well all she needs is a German phrase book
<drf|laptop> 03including Germany, France, and Belgium
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Zoroark
<drf|laptop> 03my band went to Londo

<drf|laptop> 03I AM STILL SO MAD THAT I DIDN'T GET TO >:@@@@
<SirSprinkles> 6The second religion comes up, it's instant arguing, and the mention of greed would only lead there.
<drf|laptop> 03er
<kir13> yeah
<Articuno> 12Back to work XD
<drf|laptop> 03>:((((((
<drf|laptop> 03didn't mean to look angry XD

<Zoroark> so i'm looking at google trends for "twilight zone" and it appears it has a spike every half year, coinciding with the holiday season and July 4th probably
<Zoroark> or thereabouts
<Zoroark> middle of the year
<Zoroark> http://www.google.com/trends?q=twilight+zone
<Ascendant> ;o
<Zoroark> so apparently the people who search for "lugia" the most are from the philippines
<Zoroark> the US is 6th on that list

<Hogia> 12I did a really bad one at school playing UrbanTerror once.
<Zoroark> i mostly don't make typos that actually get sent, but that's because i'm a perfectionalist and screen stuff carefully etc.

<Zoroark> huh, i actually am logged in
<Zoroark> i don't remember doing that and it has been a long time since i past logged in
*Hogia 12has ice cream
<Armageddon> ohai
<Zoroark> so i just noticed my comments thing on my profile, and it's 8 of the same thing
<Ascendant> OH
<Ascendant> that reminds me
<Ascendant> Articuno, you want the screenshots now?
<Ascendant> Skylands told me you didn't get them
<Ascendant> so I was like "oh crap"
<Zoroark> but what strikes me as weirder is that they are timestamped as 1 January 1970
<Armageddon> shit
<Zoroark> hm
<Hogia> 12I've noticed errors after posting. It sometimes thinks I double clicked or tried to start a new topic when I didn't.
<Zoroark> that comments thing appears to be on more acconts than mine, but it doesn't appear to affect all comments. I still think it's weird though.
<Zoroark> Also there are 8 or so of the same comment on my page.
<Drake> 04o-o

<Drake> 04"You are calm, collected and unconcerned with the matters of others. You like to remain a neutral observer rather than get involved with things, but deep down you do care - you just don't like to be judging"

<Hogia> 12:<
<Drake|TF2> 04Oh please tell me I didn't delete something important earlier...
<Hogia> 12D:
<Hogia> 12That could be potentially disastrous
<Drake|TF2> 04No, really?
<Espeon> 06verify game cache? (if you're talking of tf2 even :P)
<Espeon> 06And it should check + download any missing critical files anyway
<Drake|TF2> 04It just stays on the "Preparing to play Team Fortress 2" pop-up much, much longer than it should
<Espeon> 06sometimes it's there for a second, sometimes for a bit longer. I'm not entirely sure why :P
<Hogia> 12hmm.
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> maybe it has to do with the program I'm running that's using 100% CPU...?
<Drake|TF2> 04It's not the server
<Armageddon> o_o
<Kyro> nightnight
<Drake|TF2> 04It's my computer actually loading TF2
<Hogia> 12o_O
<Ascendant> Ah
<Hogia> 12noooo
<Espeon> 06The server is just hilariously laggy as it desperately tries to monopolize your CPU :D
*Espeon dies

<Drake|TF2> 04I'll just play it tomorrow
<Ascendant> [20:49:53] <%Espeon> The server is just hilariously laggy as it desperately tries to monopolize your CPU :D
<Ascendant> [20:49:54] * Espeon dies
<Ascendant> is it?
<Ascendant> the program is basically trying to find the first triangle number with over 500 divisors
<Espeon> 06yeah because when I do /me dies I'm being serious

<SirSprinkles> 6I would have done it myself by now, but I lost the link. Derp.
<SirSprinkles> 6Though I could easily just get it again.
<Silverscreen> I forgot about the Steam group.
<Silverscreen> I can just put it in Thursday's email.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I was thinking we should put a "History" page on the site, with a brief rundown of all the past BMNs.
<SirSprinkles> 6So everypony would know what we've already streamed.
<Silverscreen> I had that Idea too, but I'm saving that to put up on the Tenth BMN Night.

<Apokalipse> And so the quest for food begins
*Silverscreen 11plays the Zelda theme
<Silverscreen> 11So does TF2 just not count as a purchace from Steam?
<SilentLucario> wut? o- o
<Lati> 12Disks is a funny word =P
<Apokalipse> Maybe steam just doesn't like you
<Angel_Espeon> 13Funny word of the day?
<Lati> 12DISKS, they spin around and around LOL
<Silverscreen> 11"IT always feels like....Gabe Newell's Watching meee"
<SirSprinkles> 6...I HATE THIS SUPERMARKET
<SirSprinkles> 6And no, Silver, TF2 doesn't count as a purchase.
<Apokalipse> Silver he's watching you
<Apokalipse> He'll get you in your sleep
<Apokalipse> Last thing you'll hear is...
<Apokalipse> GET IN MAH BELLEH
<Apokalipse> terrifying
<SirSprinkles> 6My response:
<SirSprinkles> 6NO U
*Ray is bored ;A;
<Silverscreen> 11My response: NO! *nom*
<Silverscreen> 11LOl, someone has the name Sprinkleburg on Steam
<SilverSonic> Hi Feather~
<Apokalipse> lol
<Darky> 06heya Feather
<SilverSonic> also same here Ray ;3;
<Feather> 10hi~
<Silverscreen> 11So...no purchase means no game in my Steam Account, which means until I get moolah, I'm not able to do much on Steam.
<Darky> 06heya Aurora
<Aurora> nothing better than being woken up by a couple angry mockingbird parents outside your window
<SilentLucario> that happens? o - o
<SirSprinkles> 6...the Sprinkleburg on Steam is me.
<SirSprinkles> 6And yeah, no purchase = no ability to do anything.
<Apokalipse> Why am I not surprised?
<Aurora> you've never heard an angry mockingbird before?
<Aurora> btw I was highly sarcastic
<Aurora> it's annoying as heck lol
<Glacymr> 12o-O
<Apokalipse> mfw my mom just offered to make me sorbet.

<Apokalipse> My parents give me alcohol
<Apokalipse> yay
<Aurora> they have annoying voices when they're not singing
<SilentLucario> lol I've seen a Peacock and heard it
<Aurora> Peacocks are lovely <3
<Aurora> as loud as they are, I love their cries
<Aurora> I want one for a pet :>
<SilentLucario> the funnny thing is
<Ray> 02Aurora, Homura vs Sakuya. who wins?
<SilentLucario> thats how I saw them
<SilentLucario> nearby our house people own about 3 of them
<Aurora> ray you're the third person to ask me that
<Aurora> xD
<Aurora> sakuya hands down
<Ray> 02xD
<SilentLucario> they act like dogs that are smart enough to not go out and play in traffic
<Aurora> 6mainly because she has much more control over time, homura's is extremely limited
<Aurora> 6in the long run of course
<Angel_Espeon> 13If you get a pet peacock, I can instantly assume you'll name it Shen :P
<Aurora> 6in the short run, it'll either be a draw unless one catches the other off guard
<Aurora> 6SHEN
<Aurora> 6LORD SHEN
<Aurora> 6that's only if I get a white one
<Aurora> 6but I actually want a normal colored one
<Ray> 02now brb
*Ray goes to idleworld
<SilentLucario> lol
<SilentLucario> I never saw that movie
<SilentLucario> making a Banner on Paint = - = long and harder way ftw
<SirSprinkles> 6Words cannot express how much I FUCKING LOVE salsa.
*Angel_Espeon refrains from making a "long and hard" joke
<SilverSonic> lmao
<Darky> 06trolol
<Darky> 06now off to judo
<Angel_Espeon> 13SS
<Angel_Espeon> 13You're forgetting something :B
<SilentLucario> >->
<Apokalipse> Can you express it through interprative dance?
<SirSprinkles> 6No, my feet would explode.
<Apokalipse> Oh damn, you sure must love salsa then
<Apokalipse> can you try it anyway, your feet exploding sounds like sometihing mighty impressive
<SilverSonic> Oh yeah

<SheenaFox> I have TF2, Spiarl Knights, and Portal |D
<SheenaFox> *Spiral
<Quanyails> 7Eh, TF2's free, FYI. :P
<SilverSonic> and my Sprial Knights that i havent even played yet
<Quanyails> 7I would like more people to download it so we have a TF2 community on TST. XD
<SilentLucario> I'm gonna get Plants v. Zombies and Street Fighter..
<SilentLucario> I LOVE those
<RainBroDash> gonna start shooping together some cutie marks for my OC, but it's hard to even think of what to make it about >.<

<SirSprinkles> 6GIANT PINKIE PIE BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL
<RainBroDash> just like a mini poster of the mane six, or your favourite one or whatever printed onto A4 if you can't get any merch by then
<Arti|Work> YAY!!!
<Arti|Work> 12I am here!
<SheenaFox> hi Arti
<SheenaFox> :D
<Skylands> 10:3
<Arti|Work> 12Hello!!! ^v^
<Lati> 12Hihi
<SilentLucario> lol I read Artwork
<Skylands> 10Arti, Ascendant told me she sent you a pic of the stats already o.o
<Aristeo> :3
<Arti|Work> Yep she did this morning ^^
<Arti|Work> I asked her
<Skylands> 10k
<prince-dari> Well I'll get pics for you after I've done it.
<Arti|Work> I emailed it to myself so I could look at it during work LOL
<Arti|Work> God if I ever get caught on chat... if they look at my history.. I'm dead
<Quanyails> 7Then leave. D:
<Skylands> 10Yeah, don't take risks of getting fired
<SilentLucario> thats why there's a history delete button :D but yeah dun get caught. Safer to leave
<Arti|Work> Im addicted though D:
<Arti|Work> lol I don't mean THAT history
<Arti|Work> They monitor everything here you see..
<prince-dari> Tor is still the answer to all problems.
<Arti|Work> I'm hoping that I can get away with this because the URL for the widget embedded in TST is a little obscure
<Arti|Work> that and they've never picked up on the fact that I load the shoutbox url
<SilentLucario> oh I see. Sounds like my computer class
<SilverSonic> heh ive always went on IRC during school XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Arti, the gallery won't let me upload stuff :<
<Arti|Work> 12What;s the error?
<Angel_Espeon> 13"Sorry, there is no album where you are allowed to upload files"
<Arti|Work> 12LOL
<Arti|Work> 12Have you created an album then? XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I read on the info page that you're given an album by default o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well I tried making my own album anyway
<Arti|Work> 12ovO
<Angel_Espeon> 13then I was apparently able to upload files to it
<Angel_Espeon> 13but none of the files actually showed up
<Angel_Espeon> 13and instead the album was filled with art that wasn't mine o-o
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Arti|Work> 12If you would like your own gallery for uploading your own art, you are free to do so at any time as your account here automatically gives you a free gallery, just hover over "My Profile" and click "Create/Order my albums". This ONLY works for the fan art gallery, you cannot create your own albums in Sprite Art.
<Arti|Work> 12ovO
<Angel_Espeon> 13I did that, but it won't let me upload anything :/
<Arti|Work> 12One sec
<Arti|Work> 12It doesnt show that you've created an album, what did you click first?
<Angel_Espeon> 13The first thing I tried to do on the gallery was upload a file, since I assumed I already had somewhere that I could upload to o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13I did create my own after that and tried to upload stuff, but after that failed I gave up and deleted it |D
<Arti|Work> 12How did you create your own?
<Arti|Work> 12I meanlike, where did you clcik for it? (because I do it differently since I'm an admin D:)
<Arti|Work> 12Stupid SMILEY!!!
<Angel_Espeon> 13My profile -> create/order my albums -> new album
<Arti|Work> 12ovO is that "My profile" option still there?
<Arti|Work> 12XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yep o-o
<Arti|Work> 12LOL where? XD
<Arti|Work> 12Sorry ^^
<Arti|Work> 12What's the link and what button is it next to?
<Angel_Espeon> 13In the TST Gallery at the top where all the links are o3o
<Angel_Espeon> 13right at the end, next to "search"
<Quanyails> 7On another note, I'm drawing cubism.
<Quanyails> 7(Summer art assignment.)
<Lati> 12I smell smoke outside
<Arti|Work> 12Ok XD I don't have that LOL!
<Arti|Work> 12Stupid me
<Arti|Work> 12Can you paste the link please?
<RainBroDash> Send it to EqD :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13The "create/order my albums" link?
<Arti|Work> 12I must have tested all of this from Xai's profile since it's so different on my account XD
<Arti|Work> 12The profile link
<Arti|Work> 12If it is a link
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's a hover link o3o If I click it it just takes me to my forum profile
<Arti|Work> 12Ahh cool XD
<Arti|Work> 12Ok the link to create/order then please? :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13http://www.lugia.us/gallery/albmgr.php
<Arti|Work> 12Ahh gotcha
<Arti|Work> 12Ok, just click new Album
<Arti|Work> 12I'll talk you through it
<Arti|Work> 12Type the name, press the OK button
<Angel_Espeon> 13Done
<Arti|Work> 12Now
<Arti|Work> 12Click upload file
<Arti|Work> 12Don't add any info to the album yet
<Lati> 12What idiot is setting fireworks off at this hour >>
<Arti|Work> 12See if it lets you upload now
<Arti|Work> 12lol XD
<Arti|Work> 12ovO
<Arti|Work> 12It worked
<Angel_Espeon> 13It doesn't seem to actually show up in the album though o-o
<Aurora> 6arti is at work
<Arti|Work> 12Now, espy, you can go back and edit the album if you like but just leave out the keywords
<Aurora> 6Angel watch ano hana
<Arti|Work> 12I have approved it
<Arti|Work> 12It'll show now
*Aurora 6's job is done
<Arti|Work> 12They have to be approved first
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ah right, thanks a lot <3
<Arti|Work> 12Lol I need to write that in giant red letters somewhere XD
<Arti|Work> 12Anyway yeh, don't add any keywords, it'll take every image in the whole gallery with that keyword and add it to your album :3 LOL
<Arti|Work> 12Its a really handy feature for the Lugia, Arti, Other bird Pokeyman albums but NOT the personal ones
<Arti|Work> 12Seeing if there's a way to work on that now
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ah, I didn't know you had to approve the images for them to show up LOL |D I think that's where I got confused
<Aurora> 6oh yay I'm in charge of fireworks this year :D
<Arti|Work> 12It's ok ^^
*Aurora 6goes pyro
<Arti|Work> 12it just shows I need to make it clearer now

<Damos> i don't deserve it

<RainBroDash> sup ghosties :D
<Ghosties> 4Hmm, I expected Sprinks or Hip here
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Ghosties> 4Fuck
<SirSprinkles> 6Rainbow mod is enforcing the /oat/ is for pony related randomness rule, which means many native /oat/ies are being forced onto /chat/ter territory.
<Ghosties> 4Sup RainBro
<Arti|Work> 12?
<Ghosties> 4:O
<Damos> fan*
<Damos> sorry
<SirSprinkles> 6And since it all happened at once it's a giant mudfest.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I know Sprinks
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ah, damn. Not sure how but I THINK I may have accidentally uploaded a few things to the wrong gallery x-x
<RainBroDash> so Sprinks they're moving all the deraily-madness into /chat/?
<Angel_Espeon> 13oh
<Ghosties> 4I'm in the thread having a conversation with Hip
<Angel_Espeon> 13wait

<Arti|Work> 12I fixed some of tyhem
<Ghosties> 4If /oat/ really does move into /chat/ I'll be fucking surprised

<RainBroDash> I was just about to start posting on /oat/...
<Damos> YIKE
<Damos> +s
<Ghosties> 4Do it
<Damos> that just pop out of no where

<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
*Quanyails 7thinks about what to name her female Absol.
<Aeroslash> hmm
<Quanyails> 7I temporarily thought of Marly. :P
<Ghosties> 4XD Apple Bloom
<Ghosties> 4Why was Rarity listed as your favorite?
<SirSprinkles> 6I. Don't. Know.
<SirSprinkles> 6I think they were thinking mane 6. XD

<Aeroslash> Shadowtalon :O or...

<Cynder7> 6Has there been any life on here the last few days? :O
<RainBroDash> I love how DCD and Dari have no information :P
<RainBroDash> it's like DCD is just a stream-bot, and Dari is the silent protector of all things coding-related
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<SirSprinkles> 6Especially since there's no image for dari either.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Since she already joined?
<Ghosties> 4I wonder why DCD hasn't filled out his info yet
<SirSprinkles> 6Iunno.
<SirSprinkles> 6 /oat/ has reached a level of slow I've never seen before.

<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been wondering when they're gonna get updated too |D
<Aurora> 6i never even see obsi on anymore...
<Aurora> 6I wonder if we should have someone else run those...
<Quanyails> 7I'd volunteer. :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Quanyails wouldn't approve half of them :<
<Apokalipse> yup
<RainBroDash> good luck :D
<Bane> Sup bros
<RainBroDash> (I also have one, scary)
<RainBroDash> SUP BANE
<Apokalipse> thanks. If I fail I'll blame it on ghosties for sabotage
<RainBroDash> you know it apok :D
<Quanyails> 7Approving is biased, if we talk about it such-so.
<Quanyails> 7Or I could make it democratic.
<Aurora> 6Feather. FEATHER.
<SilverSonic> wb Feather! :D
<Quanyails> 7Approve all, un-approve those that get at least -5.
<Aurora> 6you scare me
<Feather> 10Aurora. AURORA.
<Aurora> 6I literally just clicked the image i drew of us two
<Aurora> 6rifght when you came back
<Aurora> 6http://www.lugia.us/gallery/displayimage.php?pos=-1127
<Aurora> 6that one lol
<Feather> 10LOL
<Ghosties> 4Sabotage? Oh, dear Apok, I would NEVER inadvertently cause you to fail
<Quanyails> 7Meta.
<Aurora> 6GET OUT OF MY MIND
<Bane> Hey Prince, do you guys in EU do anything during the 4'th of July? Mock us or something :)
<Feather> 10WHAT
<SilverSonic> o-o
<Apokalipse> Yeah ghosties, we buddies :D
<RainBroDash> we sit around sipping tea making slightly angry faces but mostly not caring :3
<V1RU5> Yes, who
<RainBroDash> and eating fish n chips* because i am right now.
<Ghosties> 4I would like to think that the Britains view our holiday the same way we (speaking for myself here) viewed the recent Royal wedding: Eh, who cares
<RainBroDash> yeah, although so many brits don't give 2 shits about the royal family
<RainBroDash> in fact a lot actively hate it
<RainBroDash> I, for one, love them. oops ;D
<Bane> ...Have you ever tried to make a royal guard laugh?
<RainBroDash> who hasn't
<Ghosties> 4I'm a little surprised that more than a few Brits disliked the ceremony
<Apokalipse> I'm from europe and if it weren't for the special movies I wouldn't even notice 4th of July
<RainBroDash> I failed. It's a lot more awkward than it looks
<RainBroDash> Ghosties I'd say it's a large majority that hated the whole idea of the national holiday and televised ceremony
<Articuno> 12Hehe I have that in my favs XD
<Bane> No one really thinks about the actual reason for the holiday
<Bane> To us it's really just
<Ghosties> 4But why? I mean, I understand why Great Britain advertised and PR'd it as a "great" event or whatever because it's Britain, one of the oldest nations on Earth. So, why hate it?
<Bane> "Firework Day"
<RainBroDash> the Britain on TV != the Britain I see every day : / it's a horrible, hate-filled mess of chavs and scummy lowlifes
<Bane> Are you cockney? :>
*Pattyrick|4thofJulyparty falls on ground randomly
<RainBroDash> they only care about themselves and sit there chiding the royal family going 'well what do they do for us, they're a waste of tax money, ra ra ra' when they have no idea that shitloads of national income comes from royal-related tourism :P
<RainBroDash> basically, idiots dude. My country is mostly idiots
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<Ghosties> 4I see
<RainBroDash> I'm from poshland, the Home Counties
<Ghosties> 4I still want to visit Britain some day
<RainBroDash> dude do it
<Ghosties> 4I plan on it
<RainBroDash> I'll take you to some badass cathedrals
<Ghosties> 4...what kind of cathedrals?
<Apokalipse> I was in Britain twice
<Apokalipse> I saw some rocks
<RainBroDash> some motherfucking awesome cathedrals
<RainBroDash> and some cliffs. we have lots of cliffs
<Ghosties> 4I lol'd more than I should have at Apok
<Apokalipse> Including stonehenge. It was the solstice so I could go close to the rocks
<Apokalipse> there were many people smoking pot there...
<RainBroDash> Apokalipse, slight herdmind there lol. so many rocks.
<Apokalipse> Oh yes, I saw cliffs to!
<RainBroDash> cliffs!
<RainBroDash> Fucking love cliffs
<Cynder7> 6Well..Cynder7.. :P
<SilverSonic> wb
<Apokalipse> To be honest they were impressive cliffs
<Skylands> 10Thanks
<Ghosties> 4When I do go to England, I HAVE to go to Beachy Head
<Apokalipse> Actually that's where I was...
<Bane> http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/
<RainBroDash> what else is there, aside from the usual herpderp 'buckingham palace, nelson's column' etc
<RainBroDash> I'll think
<Apokalipse> Old houses
<Ghosties> 4Apok was at Beachy Head?
<Apokalipse> Yeah
<Ghosties> 4Very nice, was it quiet there?
<RainBroDash> beachy head isn't that in east sussex
<Bane> http://i.imgur.com/BsMw5.jpg
<RainBroDash> hold on, talking to myself lol
<Apokalipse> I guess... I don't remember actually
<RainBroDash> (talking to myself, accidental post)
<Ghosties> 4I have this feeling that Beachy Head is abnormally quiet
<Bane> Hey sprinkles
<RainBroDash> I have a feeling I'm going to Uni right near there
<Apokalipse> I was in a hotel that was supposedly haunted... oooooh
<RainBroDash> you jelly?
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<Ghosties> 4I jelly for Beachy Head
<Apokalipse> I was to France too. They also have cliffs
<Apokalipse> and cheese
<Ghosties> 4Mmmm cheese
<Apokalipse> and crepes
<Ghosties> 4I also wanna visit Italy
<Apokalipse> I was there just last week
<Ghosties> 4Specifically, the country side. Or whatever passes for a country side there
<Apokalipse> Italians are loud
<RainBroDash> France is great
<RainBroDash> the French are obnoxious from what I've seen, but I love the language, the country and the culture
<Articuno> 12Right all the chat awards have been done
<Apokalipse> The French didn't seem obnoxious to me
<Apokalipse> I guess it also depends where in France you go
<Ghosties> 4Maybe not to Apok
<RainBroDash> they always speed up when you cross the roads in inappropriate places :P
<Ghosties> 4Because he's not American
<Quanyails> 7:)
<Apokalipse> lol
<RainBroDash> >implying America's the greatest country. (I'm going to get killed for saying this on 4th july)
<Ghosties> 4I wonder if we're still in debt to them over the Statue of Liberty
<Ghosties> 4Pfft, greatest country
<RainBroDash> more like not
<Apokalipse> OBJECTION
<Ghosties> 4And you think every other country in the world hates us? We hate us too
<RainBroDash> Britainland is best country
<Apokalipse> America's not a country *paraspriteface*
<Articuno> 12Now back to figuring this gallery prob out..
<RainBroDash> We pretend to every other country that we're ok and everything's fine, and when people like Obama visit we just lock the youths and scumbags in cages for a few days
<RainBroDash> Really we're fucked
<Ghosties> 4RBD, go say what you said over on Ponychan
<Ghosties> 4And then sit back for the laughs
<RainBroDash> which part? D:
<Ghosties> 4 /oat/ trollface.jpg
*Quanyails 7blinks.
<RainBroDash> no i meant which part of what i said:3
<Quanyails> 7No, Steam, I am currently not in TF2 right now. :|
<Apokalipse> You guys are both jelly of Slovenia because we have.... err... something... I guess
<Ghosties> 4<RainBroDash>: >implying America's the greatest country. (I'm going to get killed for saying this on 4th july)
<RainBroDash> heh
<Ghosties> 4Slovenia?
<Ghosties> 4What's that?
<RainBroDash> so much rage
<RainBroDash> apparently it's a country
<RainBroDash> it's one of those little ones that people use in quizzes
<Apokalipse> They say I live in Slovenia, but I failed to find it on the map
<Ghosties> 4o.o didn't even know it's a country
<Ghosties> 4What part of the Earth is located?
<Ghosties> 4I'm assuming Europe
<Apokalipse> It's next to Italy
<Apokalipse> east of it
<Ghosties> 4But still in Western Europe?
<Apokalipse> central europe
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<Apokalipse> or so I'm told
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<Apokalipse> Walmart has more employees as there are people in Slovenia lol
<Ghosties> 4Man, that's sad
<RainBroDash> http://i.imgur.com/SNSE7.jpg
<RainBroDash> @ghosties
<Apokalipse> I don't mind. Really the country being small is not a problem. The problem is that the politicians are complete idiots
<Ghosties> 4Scale of 1-10?
<Ghosties> 4About a 12
<RainBroDash> scale of 1 to jelly
<Bane> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130980727563.jpg
<RainBroDash> ^lol
<Ghosties> 4So, super extra jelly
<RainBroDash> fair
<Ghosties> 4*Rainbow Dash pout*
<RainBroDash> :3
<Apokalipse> I'm not jelly. We have caves here. Obviously caves are bad ass
<RainBroDash> We have caves
<RainBroDash> best caves
<Ghosties> 4Huh, there's a place called Wolverhampton
<Ghosties> 4Sounds neat
<RainBroDash> The longest cave system in the UK is the Easegill System in the Yorkshire Dales, with at least 72 km (45 mi) of passageways.
<RainBroDash> Wolverhampton is a shithole
<Apokalipse> We have karst caves. You be 'td aen know what that is probably, so it must be bad ass
<RainBroDash> all football hooligans and retards
<Quanyails> 7Anyway, I'm lagging again.
<Quanyails> 7I'll talk to you guys later. o3o
<Apokalipse> damn you keyboard
<Ghosties> 4Football..soccer, yes?
<Apokalipse> You don't even know what that is probably*
<RainBroDash> soccer. as in you play with your FOOT and a round BALL. Not your american sport which you play with your HANDS and an orange leather EGG
<RainBroDash> Handegg != Football = soccer
<Ghosties> 4Yeah yeah
<Ghosties> 4I got it :P
<RainBroDash> :D
<Ghosties> 4I don't even like American football, or soccer
<Ghosties> 4Hell
<Ghosties> 4I don't even like sports
<Ghosties> 4Except for two
<Ghosties> 4Skateboarding and snowboarding
<Ghosties> 4Fucking love those
<Cynder7> 6...
<RainBroDash> in fairness, me neither. EXCEPT TENNIS ALASDGHALKDG WIMBLEDON WAS GREAT

<SirSprinkles> 6;-;
<Ghosties> 4See?
<Ghosties> 4I told you most people were gonna complain :/
<RainBroDash> :>
<Ghosties> 4...sorry, Sprinks
<Apokalipse> I don't go on ponychan, so I have no idea what you're talking about
<Ghosties> 4You know you're mah bro
<Bane> what purpose does /oat/ serve?
<Ghosties> 4Probably nothing after the cleanup
<RainBroDash> practically none now haha
<Ghosties> 4It'll be filled with nothing but party threads most likely, and it'll become a crapssacharine board
<Bane> what purpose <i>did<i> it serve?
<Bane> oh right no html ha
<RainBroDash> it was randomness abound
<Ghosties> 4More like, it was where all the drama/gossip/mudslinging/internal politics took place
<RainBroDash> :3
<Apokalipse> So what happened now?
<Ghosties> 4Ergo, it was the most interesting and entertaining
<Ghosties> 4!!RainbowDash mod decided to clean up the board
<RainBroDash> nothing non-pony basically
<Ghosties> 4And it caused a massive shitstorm between him and users
<RainBroDash> and he moved oat users to /chat/ so that pissed chat off
<drfsupercenter> 03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/079d4c9c-4e37-4228-983f-1806ac525440.png
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Ghosties> 4So now
<Ghosties> 4You have /chat/ regulars and /oat/ people in closed quarters
<RainBroDash> Everypony hates everypony else? :3
<junh1024-XD> "It's safe to dance!"
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL XD
<Ghosties> 4So if you wanna know where all the shit's gonna go down, go to /chat/
<Apokalipse> Doesn't sound like love and tolerance to me
<Ghosties> 4PFFFFFFFFFFFFFT
<Ghosties> 4Love and tolerance is just a motto
<drfsupercenter> 03http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/demotivational-posters-fail.jpg
<Ghosties> 4Some users actually believe in it, and I kinda respect them for it
<Ghosties> 4Moony, Amonisis...
<Ghosties> 4But other people?
<Ghosties> 4Nah
<HyperMetalLugia> Can a Creeper destroy that?
<Aurora> 6god yes
<Aurora> 6I would rage if one did though
<Apokalipse> Yeah, I can see how love and tolerance wouldn't work all around, but surely people can strive towards it?
<Lati> 12WHY is KFC always on TV when I am hungry
<RainBroDash> I only just learned that the official motto of america is actually 'In God we Trust'?
<RainBroDash> Is that right?
<Ghosties> 4I'm just waiting for the day when I log onto Ponychan and the front page will read "Ponychan...ponychan has changed." And then wait for /chat/ and /oat/ to say the same thing but replace Ponychan with their names.
<Ghosties> 4And then proceed to find the closest thread which will read "BAWWWW, REMEMBER THE GOOD OL DAYS"
<Ghosties> 4Because that's all Ponychan really is
<Ghosties> 4Just round table discussions and cliques
<Ghosties> 4Sorry about that, went into a mini rant :D
<Apokalipse> I only posted on ponychan about 5 times
<drfsupercenter> 03http://mthruf.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/job-fails-society.jpg
<Ghosties> 4Anyways
<drfsupercenter> 03I know I pasted this but different people are on now XD
<Apokalipse> So I don't really care all that much
<RainBroDash> Ghosties, don't ever think you can't rant to us dude. We're your bros, it's our job to help you come to terms with stuff and talk about how you feel about stuff exactly like this
<junh1024-XD> >:#
<RainBroDash> It's what we do
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Ghosties> 4Not sure how to respond to that, RBD
<SilverSonic> ;p
<RainBroDash> Just brohoof me dude
<Apokalipse> I like rants
<Ghosties> 4Brohoof
<Skylands> 10Colon p
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties, you should totally buck the discussion thread.
*RainBroDash brohoofs
<RainBroDash> good stuff
<Ghosties> 4Should I, Sprinkles?
<Skylands> 10Semicolon*
<Ghosties> 4I think I will
<HyperMetalLugia> o dot o
<drfsupercenter> 03^ approved
<Ghosties> 4There, it's been bucked
<Ghosties> 4Hmmm...let's see what /oat/ looks like now
<SirSprinkles> 6Looks like a bomb hit and all that's left are appreciation threads.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai Espeon
<Ghosties> 4I thought the clean up wasn't to be till tomorrow
<Articuno> 12Skylands? D: can you please check the Sprite gallery for me? XD
<Articuno> 12Are you logged into it..?
<Ghosties> 4I guess the regulars up and outright left /oat/
<SirSprinkles> 6The cleanup was today.
<Ghosties> 4 /chat/ is such a...odd place to see right now
<SirSprinkles> 6There's an image of a bunch of threads being moved.
<Ghosties> 4Where?
<Skylands> 10Hang on
<SirSprinkles> 6I didn't save it...

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm already logged in, that's how it's gonna stay lmao.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So Feather, I read that Pinkie Pie Cupcakes story.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh, Arti, I've uploaded more than 10 pictures to the art gallery. Just sayin' ;3
<Feather> 108D
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I'll remember to upload all other new pictures to the gallery too <3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And then it dawned on me
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That Pinkie Pie sounds just like one of my characters
<Kryo> fff im afk
<Feather> 10:o
<RainBroDash> I had to sell my good one, I still have a ghetto one i modded out of two kids pogo sticks
<RainBroDash> those were the days

*HyperMetalLugia is still surprised
<HyperMetalLugia> But ohwell
<Angel_Espeon> 13Really? I don't think it's one of my best, in fact I see loads of errors xD
<Feather> 10I don't <3

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02For Feather
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Hello
<Espeon> 06I'm clearly rather biased, but I think the same! :p
<Feather> 10:D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm sure you haven't seen it
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL, thanks a lot~ <3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I don't even know if you watch me on dA or not anymore XD
<Ghosties> 4 /oat/…/oat/ has changed. It’s not about shipping, or GET battles It’s not even about oatmeal, or Pinkie Pie parties, or love threads.
<Ghosties> 4It’s an endless series of ‘how are you’ threads Propagated by the users who remained in /oat/ after the cleanup that swept through.
<NightSeas> 12Hey Angel_Espeon
<Ghosties> 4 /oat/, and its vast disappearance of drama and mudslinging, Has become a rational, hollowed-out image of what it once was.
<Ghosties> 4 /oat/ has changed.
<RainBroDash> lol ghosties
<Ghosties> 4That's what I've got so far
<RainBroDash> magical
<Ghosties> 4:P
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Cheese :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02There we go
<Ghosties> 4I think I may need to change the GET part though, since I'm still seeing them on /oat/
<RainBroDash> they shouldn't be though
<RainBroDash> right?
<Ghosties> 4In fact, I bet GET threads will stay there because !!Celestia advocates them
<RainBroDash> ha
<RainBroDash> hopefully inb4 mod conflict!
<RainBroDash> that would be lulzy
<Ghosties> 4Here's how I see it, if GET threads are moved then the BMN selection threads will be moved also
<Ghosties> 4But then
<Feather> 10I do if you were talking to me Shiny
<Feather> 10XD
<Ghosties> 4This won't be bad for us
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I never know lol
<Ghosties> 4Because it seems that there's a lot more traffic over on /chat/
<RainBroDash> BMN is about ponies?
<RainBroDash> GET is about GET.
<Quanyails> 7You got my message in PM, Feather?
<drf|PartedMagic> so, I'll be on here for the next day or so
<Ghosties> 4Originally, the BMN selection threads were on /oat/ but were then moved to /chat/ because they weren't "pony" enough for /oat/
<drf|PartedMagic> backing up my main Windows hard drive and then reformatting XD
<RainBroDash> oh really
<RainBroDash> :/
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<RainBroDash> My perception of 'pony enough' must be feebly inaccurate
<Apokalipse> How is BMN not pony?
<Ghosties> 4We then had to argue our claim over on /meta/ to the mods of Ponychan to get them to allow us to stay on /oat/
<NightSeas> 12Wb Creideiki
<Ghosties> 4Because BMN is mostly about movies
<Ghosties> 4and just a little about ponies
<Creideiki> Hello
<RainBroDash> i guess :)
<Ghosties> 4But even so, GET has absolutely NOTHING to do with ponies
<RainBroDash> although we're all here because we like ponies
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02,0,
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02.-.
<RainBroDash> and look at my name
<Ghosties> 4And I guess the mods understood that and allowed us back on /oat/
<RainBroDash> (it's like ponies)
<Apokalipse> It's a site for bronies to watch movies
<Ghosties> 4Right
<Apokalipse> we reference ponies all the time
<Ghosties> 4But the mods didn't see it that way at first
<Apokalipse> Most of the preshow is pony videos
<Apokalipse> pony
<RainBroDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljPFZrRD3J8
<Apokalipse> Wait, why am I saying this since we all know this
<RainBroDash> Horses = Braveer = that link
<RainBroDash> apok, you can vent your frustration to us in their misunderstanding of BMN xD I get what you mean dude
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 10Dusclops.

<drf|PartedMagic> I forgot mibbit can't disable orange like mIRC can :/
<RainBroDash> inderdaad i get you
<Ghosties> 4I think that's what the mods saw

<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm?
<drf|PartedMagic> for some reason, my motherboard refuses to let me boot CDs
<drf|PartedMagic> I had to spend a while making a Parted Magic flash drive
<HyperMetalLugia> What? LOL
<drf|PartedMagic> since the CDs I burned didn't work
<Lati> 12Hi NightSeas :D
<drf|PartedMagic> >_>

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I keep forgetting today's the 4th of July lmao
<drf|PartedMagic> 12 SATA ports, 6 USB 3.0 ports, XD
<drf|PartedMagic> it's just being dumb about booting from CDs
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 10Beheeyem.
<DSD|away> 10weird
<drf|PartedMagic> but yay Parted Magic flash drives?

<DSD|away> 10Sorry about that
<DSD|away> 10and no it hasn't
<drf|PartedMagic> if you google unetbootin
<drf|PartedMagic> it can download and create the files for you :P
<DSD|away> 10*Cynderpoke*
<Ghosties> 4The next time I see Combustiblelemons, I'm going to ask him if the cleanup in /oat/ was due to him
<Cynder7> 6:P
<RainBroDash> :o
<Ghosties> 4Or, at the very least, part of the reason
<Ghosties> 4for the cleanup
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, I tried to
<RainBroDash> Might as well explain the situation surrounding him, it's not like /oat/ is going quickly today ;)
<HyperMetalLugia> But I have no flash drives :P
<Cynder7> 6Is V1RU5 some kind of mod person or something?
<RainBroDash> and I've got all day :P

<RainBroDash> 4L of pepsi max, some Peach Passion tic-tacs, a bag of Haribo Starmix, and some Cadbury's Chocolate Fingers
<SirSprinkles> 6Snickers beats all of that.
<SirSprinkles> 6I also have Diet Green Tea.
<Apokalipse> Why is that not being digested yet?
<RainBroDash> Apok because I just finished my lunch
<SirSprinkles> 6Because I was eating the OTHER Snickers.
<Articuno> 12Anyone?
<RainBroDash> :3
<Skylands> 10Meep
<Articuno> 12Yay!
<SilverSonic> im here ;p
<Articuno> 12I'm going to set you as a gallery mod for a sec
<Skylands> 10Testing something?
<Articuno> 12Tell me if you see admin controls in the gallery
<Articuno> 12yep
<RainBroDash> and sprinks maybe your snickers does win. but have you ever had this?:
<Articuno> 12Try now ^^
<RainBroDash> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hR7F-MqvRzI/TTwt73YOcPI/AAAAAAAALbc/3hdmrLwGQT4/s1600/snickmax1.bmp
<RainBroDash> i dont know if you get it in the states
<Skylands> 10I see them
<Articuno> 12Brilliant
<RainBroDash> instead of the layer below the caramel, it's ALL caramel and peanuts
<SirSprinkles> 6I've had one, though I've never seen them in stores...
<Articuno> 12That's that sorted
<RainBroDash> they're amazing, and every store here has them :3
<RainBroDash> that's my no.1 chocolate bar at the moment
<Articuno> 12Now, I'm appointing Aurora as a gallery mod to help sort out the images, I'm taking away admin approval as there will now be three of us working on it so we shouldn't need it ^^
<Skylands> 10Am I keeping these privileges? :P Not that I visit the art gallery often, I could try my best to visit more often
<RainBroDash> here's a question by the way (one that doensn't even matter that much, but hey)
<Ghosties> 4I have Combos
<Articuno> 12lol sorry ^^;
<Articuno> 12Was just a test
<Articuno> 12Although
<Ghosties> 4Buffalo Blue Cheese combos
<Articuno> 12As a global I could probably set that up for you..
<Skylands> 10Nah, that's what I meant
<Skylands> 10I don't really want them LOL
<Articuno> 12Oh XD
<Articuno> 12Ok XD
<RainBroDash> Would you prefer if I carried on trying to be 'americanized' in my language by using words like store, or should i just stick with britishisms like shops
<Skylands> 10that's not what I meant* Blah, typos
<Ghosties> 4Stay British, makes you awesome
<Lati> 12Who here likes GRIMER?
<Apokalipse> Whatever you prefer
<Apokalipse> does it mater?
<Apokalipse> matter*
<RainBroDash> well I like trying to adapt to your language, it's fun
<RainBroDash> (not yours apok, too hard)
<Apokalipse> lol
<RainBroDash> but I could just collapse back to british and keep it as a defining point of RainBroDash himself :p
<DSD|away> 10not sure
<DSD|away> 10weird users have been poping up
<Cynder7> 6I saw him on here yesterday I think too..
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Apokalipse> I so want you to speak slovenian now
<Apokalipse> it would be hilarious
<RainBroDash> :D I can do french
<Cynder7> 6Btw,has Icy been on lately?
<RainBroDash> that's about it
<Ghosties> 4What kind of shops do you have over there?
<Ghosties> 4>mfw I said shops instead of stores
<RainBroDash> XD
<RainBroDash> and that's a tad broad dude
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Ghosties> 4Convenience shops?
<RainBroDash> xD
<Ghosties> 4Or is that still too American?
<Ghosties> 4Oh dear
<RainBroDash> we have corner shops broski
<Ghosties> 4Aha! Yes, that
<RainBroDash> because of our silly roman roads, there are corners everywhere
<Ghosties> 4Those places where you can get snacks and beverages
<Ghosties> 4Places that aren't pubs
<RainBroDash> so all the immigrants came along, stole the corners and set up shops there:)
<Bane> and condoms
<Ghosties> 4>mfw I said pubs instead of bars
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm waiting for somepony to join the stream...
<RainBroDash> what, sprinks?

<Angel_Espeon> 13Don't make me cut you Lati LOL
<RainBroDash> apokalipse, your shockwave flash plugin keep failing?

<ScriptBot> Espeon, you are a 2Torterra.
<Feather> 10!pokemon

<ScriptBot> Lati, you are a 9Luxio.
<Feather> 10decent
<RainBroDash> Mine's done that more than normal recently
<Espeon> 06... better than Grimer, but we all know that it lies
<Articuno> 12Shiny-Growlithe you know you're actually great at art..
<Espeon> 06THIS
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Probably not the best thing lmao
<RainBroDash> like, last few weeks
<Articuno> 12the poses are really fluid..
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02.-.
<SirSprinkles> 6Mine hasn't been doing that..
<Articuno> 12they look natural
<Ghosties> 4WhatPayne, do you come from Ponychan?
<Lati> 12yes...grimer...and lies.
<Articuno> 12I envy that, mine are ridgid and fake..
<RainBroDash> it's manageable, and probably because I watch 3 livestreams at once along with lots of facebook and youtube tabs
<Apokalipse> my computer just trolls me
<WhatPayne> What? No... Just decided to check if anythings up :/
<Apokalipse> ohai, I'm going to freeze up now. See you in about an hour
<Ghosties> 4Oh, no, nothing right now
<Angel_Espeon> 13!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Angel_Espeon, you are a 6Bouffalant.
<Ghosties> 4Not until Friday
<Angel_Espeon> 13Moooo
<Lati> 12Bulls
<WhatPayne> Figured that :)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I think it's because you're working with more human-like anatomy Arti
<Lati> 12are male wannabe cows
<Bane> Sprinkles, are you streaming right now?
<Ghosties> 4Thanks for stopping by, though
<SirSprinkles> 6EPIC SAX SPIKE

<WhatPayne> No problem... Is that looping feed you have going on?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm just leaving it on because I like Epic Sax Spike.
<Bane> *facehoof
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello
<Ghosties> 4Most likely, WhatPayne
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hi Chao
<Bane> It's tattoo'd in my brain by now
<SirSprinkles> 6It's on loop on youtube, I've got it streaming live.
<Lati> 12Osha-wott!
*Lati runs
<Ghosties> 4You know
<WhatPayne> Well at least it's epic sax.
*ChaoMagma 4chases
<Ghosties> 4I think epic sax Spike should be our "Off air" signal
*ChaoMagma 4throws a Perish Ball at Shiny-Growlithe
<SirSprinkles> 6It will be for about a month.
<Ghosties> 4Instead of just "closing time"
<RainBroDash> with an off-air watermark
<SirSprinkles> 6Then we'll switch to something else.
<ChaoMagma> 4yayz! i caught a growlithe!
<SirSprinkles> 6...also, that would be epic.
<RainBroDash> that bulge though. I can't look
<SirSprinkles> 6If I could figure out how to do that...
<Lati> 12aww the stretchy yellow man's finger has been cut off
<Lati> 12I didn't do it
<Lati> 12<< >>
<Ghosties> 4Maybe Silver or dari know how
<SirSprinkles> 6Or DCD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But I'm already owned
<RainBroDash> just poke dari with a stick with a note on the end of it saying what he needs to code :D
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Bane> Is there anything else you can stream right now? Not to be rude or anything
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So you can't catch me
<Lati> 12I'm the gingerbread man!
<Lati> 12LOL
<RainBroDash> lol@bane NO :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13I read that as "can't touch me"
<WhatPayne> Oh yeah... You guys planning on doing any special occasions like this past weekend in future?
<Angel_Espeon> 13then a certain song played in my head
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.

<SirSprinkles> ?
<Ghosties> Okay, so, October
<Ghosties> Halloween month yeah?
<WhatPayne> Apokalipse, same here... I guess its the convenience of finding live chat with fellow Bronies. And add video stream to that no matter how simple...
<Ghosties> Well
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Articuno> 12QUAN
<Apokalipse> Yeah. Damn you bronies you're too interesting
<Ghosties> What if limit the selection of movies to "horror" films one week?
<Articuno> 12The gallery is fixed for you!
<Quanyails> 7Hello!
<Ghosties> Aside from the Nick Cage special we're doing
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<Quanyails> 7Huzzah!
<RainBroDash> for some reason almost everyone who joins this stream is someone i get on well with
<Bane> ^^ Right?
<SirSprinkles> Sounds awesome, though obviously we'd have to run it by everypony else.
<Quanyails> 7And I blink at that Lugia on the gallery information page. O_o
<Ghosties> Of course
<ChaoMagma> 4Huzzah?
<ClockworkPie> lol this song
<RainBroDash> (not sure if the same can be said about me for everyone, but hey ;D) and I really like how we mostly do get along ;P
<SirSprinkles> 6INCOMING MANLY TEARS
<Ghosties> Or, we could have a 'mods pick horror movies' or something
<RainBroDash> oh you sprinkles
<SirSprinkles> That would be pretty cool too.
<WhatPayne> I haven't really recognized myself as a part of any other group before in my life like I have with Bronies.
<Quanyails> 7That Lugia is staring at me. o3O

<ChaoAqua> 2problem is, i'm comfy AND lazy
<RainBroDash> erryday im mutinh
<Ghosties> 4During Saturday's stream, I wasn't paying too much attention because it was the encore. So, I had another tab up and Silver was going "Dude, you gotta show the Nigel vid"
<RainBroDash> muting
<ChaoAqua> 2:3
<RainBroDash> lmao
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7And...
<Ghosties> 4I didn't know what he was talking about but didn't pay much attention. In any case, he played it and I had decided to unmute my audio
<Ghosties> 4And then I went back to doing what I was doing
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not a fan of the Kanye, but the visuals for this part are amazing.
<Cynder7> 6I thought he hated the ponies.. :P
<Ghosties> 4I heard Pinkie's singing VA come in
<ChaoHerba> 3and... i don't know if my mom will give me permission to go downstairs
<Cynder7> 6What are you laughing about? o.o

<Quanyails> 7Well, I volunteered.

<Bane> Seems like there are bronies in every subculture
<Cynder7> 6Aa,cool!

*ChaoHOTD 4goes back to watching some students shoot zombies
*Skylands keeps misreading Parted Magic for Puella Magi
<drf|PartedMagic> wtf is that
<Skylands> 10Anime
<Aurora> 6lol
<drf|PartedMagic> Parted Magic is a Linux system that's designed for cloning hard drives and whatnot
<drf|PartedMagic> which is precisely what I'm doing
<Skylands> 10k

<drf|PartedMagic> LOL
<ChaoHOTD> 4I'M NOT SHOUTING!!!!!!11
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have no brothers, so it's my mum who does the shouting in this house :B
*Quanyails 7yawns.
<ChaoHOTD> 4I'M TYPING IN CAPS!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S DIFFERENT!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Quanyails> 7Well, I've got an SAT class half of the week starting tomorrow for a good deal of summer.
*ChaoHOTD 4just saw a daughter bite her mom
<ChaoHOTD> 4i'm SO gonna have nightmares
<Aurora> 6lol SAT classes
<Aurora> 6I can't believe they have classes for that
<Quanyails> 7Ayup.
<drf|PartedMagic> I know right
<drf|PartedMagic> The SAT is easy
<drf|PartedMagic> just suck it up and take it
<SirSprinkles> 6inb4 BEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<drf|PartedMagic> my mom tried to make me study for the ACT and I was like "you do realize they cover about everything, right?"
<Aurora> 6ACT was so annoying
<Quanyails> 7Eh, parents do want me to get a high score.
<Aurora> 6it was horribly easy
<drf|PartedMagic> SAT is worse
<Aurora> 6except the science portion
<drf|PartedMagic> XD
<Ghosties> 4Well, get Duke Nukem 3D
<Aurora> 6which is infamous for being ungodly
<drf|PartedMagic> I did alright on it actually
<drf|PartedMagic> my worst section was English
<Aurora> 6same
<drf|PartedMagic> no surprise there
<drf|PartedMagic> but I got a 29 overall
<drf|PartedMagic> both times, too
<drf|PartedMagic> I took it twice, got the same score LOL
<Aurora> 6I got a 29 on the ACT, 1650 on SAT
<Aurora> 6...lol
<drf|PartedMagic> I never even took the SAT
*Quanyails 7blinks.
<drf|PartedMagic> because no schools in Michigan care about the SAT
<Aurora> 6yeah i'm amazed you're takig it quan
<drf|PartedMagic> I took it back in like 8th grade as one of those "Take the SAT early to see what it's like!" things
<Quanyails> 7Eh, not my decision. :P
<Aurora> 6the only places that really care about SAT are here in the west lol
<drf|PartedMagic> nah, lots of east coast schools require the SAT
<SirSprinkles> ...the mod thread just 404'd
<Aurora> 6oh really?
<drf|PartedMagic> yeah
<Quanyails> 7But I get ~750 on my SAT2s.
<drf|PartedMagic> east coast does too
<Aurora> 6we're always told they want ACT xD
<WhatPayne> Oh wow. I havem't played that game in really long time.
<drf|PartedMagic> I dunno
<drf|PartedMagic> I just know around here it's ACT
<Quanyails> 7SAT's primary here.
<Aurora> 6no one cares about ACT here
<drf|PartedMagic> yeah
<drf|PartedMagic> Quany, what colleges were you going to apply to?
<Quanyails> 7ACT's still acceptable, just less common.
<drf|PartedMagic> s/were/are?
<Aurora> 6why do we have 2 tests then D:
<Quanyails> 7I have no idea.
<drf|PartedMagic> Aurora, because two separate companies
<drf|PartedMagic> if they only had one, people would be like OMFG MONOPOLY and not allow it
<drf|PartedMagic> >_>
<Aurora> 6lol
<SirSprinkles> 6There's more blood than a rubber hose bottle of foot!
<drf|PartedMagic> I wish we could just have a monopoly of Microsoft made OSes, screw Mac
<drf|PartedMagic> I mean
<drf|PartedMagic> hi
<Ghosties> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Ghosties> You mean our mod thread?
<SirSprinkles> Yeah.
<Ghosties> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Aurora> 6would make life easy >.>
<drf|PartedMagic> I know right
<Bane> Vagina
<Ghosties> Well
<Ghosties> looks like we need a new one
<SirSprinkles> ...why is this not a pony vid yet?
<Ghosties> 4:O
<Ghosties> 4That's a naughty word
<drf|PartedMagic> Monopolies are only bad if they're abusive
<Ghosties> Give it time
<drf|PartedMagic> if it's something like standard software used by companies or something
<Bane> Hey he said it first
<drf|PartedMagic> it would be a lot more helpful
<SirSprinkles> 6...TF?
<drf|PartedMagic> same with standardized tests
*Quanyails 7is reminded of California in the early 2000s.
<Quanyails> 7But I digress.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, goodnight all <3
<drf|PartedMagic> but tell the government that
<Quanyails> 7Good night, AE>
<HyperMetalLugia> nii
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Lati> 12Bye Angel :3
<Quanyails> 7I don't see too much of a point in standardized tests; perhaps to compare education, but not as a prerequisite for college. O.o
<Quanyails> 7Brb.
<drf|PartedMagic> who knows
<drf|PartedMagic> anyway, I need to go for an hour or two.
<Aurora> 6I see the point actually
<drf|PartedMagic> not gonna bother changing my name as I'm still on Parted Magic so yeah
<Bane> Well I'm off to celebrate Firework Day, see you guys later!
<Aurora> 6a college isn't going to waste their time on someone who doesn't care
<drf|PartedMagic> the point is to prevent idiots like haii from going to college
*drf|PartedMagic runs
<ChaoHOTD> 4YAYZ! RANDOM CAPS CHAT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<SirSprinkles> Hey, anyway you can give admin to the rest of us on the steam?
<Ghosties> I know I can make you guys officers
<Ghosties> Don't know about admin
<SirSprinkles> Good enough.
<Ghosties> Alright
<Ghosties> Hold on
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh u DRF :p
<drf|PartedMagic> anyway bye
<SirSprinkles> Just need to be able to regulate questions and crap without people going "HURRR DURRR HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S REALLY YOU" or something
<Ghosties> That's fine
<Ghosties> In that case, you may want to change your names to our BMN names
<Ghosties> Then again, I'm not or plan to
<Ghosties> So
<Ghosties> whatever
<SirSprinkles> *shrug* I don't think anypony cares, as long a we're obviously the people running it.
<WhatPayne> I think I'll hit the sack as well...
<SirSprinkles> 6G'night.
<WhatPayne> Thanks for the evening entertainement... And the game help Ghosties.
<Ghosties> My only request is thus: that I be given the controls of the Steam group and all that. I figure since you're doing the Twitter, Silver's doing the email (mostly) and Hip's doing the Facebook I could regulate the Steam group?
<Ghosties> 4No problem, WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> I guess I'll keep checking this feed for these unexpected streams. ;)
<WhatPayne> Well, night.
<Ghosties> 4Goodnight
<SirSprinkles> Fine by me.
<SirSprinkles> And the only reason I'm doing the twitter is because nopony else seems to want to touch it.
<Ghosties> Thanks ^_^ makes me feel all important and stuff :P
<SirSprinkles> It's just nice to have everybody be able to access pretty much everything in case somepony goes away for a bit or something.
<SirSprinkles> Which reminds me... we need to get the color and flood scripts from dari and ask him how to use them.
<Ghosties> I know what you mean, and that makes sense
<Ghosties> Oh yeah, we do need to get a hold of dari
<Ghosties> But you know how difficult that is
<SirSprinkles> That's the main reason I have the links to edit the site, which came in handy today, thank gawd I asked Silver for them.
<Ghosties> Indeed
<Ghosties> The main reason I didn't even touch that problem is because I have no idea how to work a website
<Ghosties> I believe I would have made it worse >_<
<Jazmyn> hi :)
<RainBroDash> Hi Jazmyn
<Jazmyn> :3
<RainBroDash> :3 any mods about
<Creideiki> Disk partitioning is "fun."
<SirSprinkles> I have years of html, so I found the problem almost immediately.
<Ghosties> Hipster really needs to get an avatar for his steam account
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<SirSprinkles> Yes, he does.
<Ghosties> It bothers me that I have to look at ? every time I see his name
<RainBroDash> ohai sprinks
<RainBroDash> up to much?
<Ghosties> Just to clarify, you're Sprinkleburg, right?
<Jazmyn> lalalala

<SirSprinkles> 6I'm on /oat/ now.
<Ghosties> Good
<RainBroDash> through the barren wasteland
<RainBroDash> hah
<SirSprinkles> 6It's so nice and quiet on /oat/...
<Ghosties> Have you checked it yet?
<RainBroDash> >nice
<RainBroDash> eh?
<SirSprinkles> 6See the beautiful bomb-destroyed scenery...
<RainBroDash> heh
<Jazmyn> its raining :(
<SirSprinkles> Yep.
<Ghosties> 4And to think, Sprinks disliked the new /oat/ just hours ago
<RainBroDash> :((
*ChaoHOTD 4breaks the perfect 5 minute silence
<ChaoHOTD> 4ASDFGHJKL!
<ChaoHOTD> 4:3

<Jazmyn> yay!!
<SirSprinkles> Yep.
<ChaoHOTD> 4gtg
<ChaoHOTD> 4bye all
<Ghosties> Cool
<SirSprinkles> 6I dislike the slowness of new /oat/.
<Jazmyn> brb
<RainBroDash> How many possible new mods have you interviewed so far, how many are you doing in the near future, and how many do you hope to take on as new mod positions?
<Ghosties> 4o.o
<RainBroDash> (if any of that is classified, ignore me)
<SirSprinkles> 6It makes GETting a pain due to random jumps every now and then when you aren't expecting them.
<Ghosties> 4OUT OF FUCKING LEFT FIELD
<Ghosties> 4We've interviewed...about 7?
<RainBroDash> :D:D inappropriately detailed question time is srsbzns
<Ghosties> 4I think?
<SirSprinkles> 6A lot.
<SirSprinkles> 6A few.
<SirSprinkles> 6And a very few.
<Ghosties> 4THOUGH I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE FIRST INTERVIEW
<Ghosties> 4ALWAYS
<SirSprinkles> 6In that order.
<RainBroDash> hah Ghosties, explain?XD
<SirSprinkles> 6We will never forget that interview.
<SirSprinkles> 6Can't.
<SirSprinkles> 6Classified.
<RainBroDash> and thanks sprinks, at first I was like >ask Sprinks 3 questions, get one shitty answer, but thanks :3
<RainBroDash> it's cool
<Ghosties> 4Mod/user confidentiality and all that
<RainBroDash> but sounds ruddy hilarious
<RainBroDash> d:
<RainBroDash> sorry if I keep delving into the whole mod thing frequently, it's just playing on my mind xP
<SirSprinkles> 6Hopefully we get more mods soon.
<SirSprinkles> 6Lord knows I could use somepony else to make do a lot of the work I do.
*Shiny-Growlithe hugs Feather
<Ghosties> 4>make do a lot of the work I do
<Quanyails> 7Speaking of...
<Ghosties> 4*stares*
*RainBroDash jumps around, hoof in the air shouting 'ME, PICK ME, I LIKE MENIAL TASKS'
<Quanyails> 7Feather, how's that download? :P
<SirSprinkles> 6...what?
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
<SirSprinkles> 6Can't say I'm not honest.
<Ghosties> 4I was implying that the sentence looked oddly structured
<SirSprinkles> 6It was oddly structured.
<Ghosties> 4Thus
<Ghosties> 4The stare
<SirSprinkles> 6But that's what happens when you haven't slept in... 59 hours.
<Ghosties> 4Dude
<Ghosties> 4-_- get some sleep, Sprinks
<Ghosties> 4We're not streaming for another few days
*Quanyails 7blinks.
*Quanyails 7sees a glitch in the sprite gallery.
*Quanyails 7logs in/out.
<RainBroDash> it's fine dude D: technically. although a synonymous phrase for 'use somebody' would make the correctness more obvious; as in "I could do with someone else to make do a lot of the work I do'
<Quanyails> 7Darn it, it's still there. O_o
<RainBroDash> in a grammatical sense it's fine. It's just a bit untidy
<Ghosties> 4That still looks weired
<Ghosties> 4gah
<RainBroDash> :(
<Ghosties> 4weird
<Ghosties> 4too many 'do's in there
<Ghosties> 4Two is the acceptable limit
<Ghosties> 4THREE IS JUST OVERBOARD

<Ghosties> 4So, no, RBD, it's not pronounced that way :P

<HyperMetalLugia> Nobody cares about Linux either :>

<HyperMetalLugia> Nobody cares about Kyubey
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Ascendant> <HyperMetalLugia> Nobody cares about Linux either :>
<Ascendant> you'd be surprised
<NightSeas> 12Linux is epic
<Ghosties> 4Sup Silver
<HyperMetalLugia> If you want to do nothing easy, sure ;D
<HyperMetalLugia> Epicly silly at times too :p
<NightSeas> 12Have you used Linux before, HML? XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh hey Silver, when'd you get here?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes derp :p
<Ascendant> you only don't like it because you don't know how to use it ;p
<Ghosties> 4It appears just recently
<HyperMetalLugia> But I didn't see it as useful
<HyperMetalLugia> So, why do I need to know how to use it :p
<Ascendant> how is it not useful?
<NightSeas> 12Ah, well in my opinion, it’s pretty useful
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, useful for everyday use
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<RainBroDash> oh hai guise
<HyperMetalLugia> Only for one off jobs
<SirSprinkles> 6Has he... said anything?
<SirSprinkles> 6And hi RainBro.

<RainBroDash> soup
<RainBroDash> still on skype sprinks?
<HyperMetalLugia> Doesn't every normal person? :P
<Revy> Just line any other day.
<HyperMetalLugia> Of course, running Linux only programs and looking through thousands of distros for something you want is a bit silly and annoying :P

<Anthony> lol
<Revy> Like, even.
<Ghosties> 4That reminds me, I should at some point arrange a BMN TF2 session
<Anthony> about two or three poeple drove by with loud booming music
<HyperMetalLugia> Why? :o
<NightSeas> 12[20:05] <Pattyrick> even I, an Apple understander, like Windows better than Mac <-- We were talking about Linux XD
<Pattyrick> I know
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to be able to get on Steam first...
<Silverscreen> So far I'm good with Heavy, Engineer, and Medic.
<Anthony> gave me a headache
<HyperMetalLugia> So, Linux and Mac fall under "Non-windows" or widely adopted OSes too :P
<Ascendant> [12:05:18] <HyperMetalLugia> Of course, running Linux only programs and looking through thousands of distros for something you want is a bit silly and annoying :P
<Pattyrick> I've used Linux once, but I didn't get to see much of it
<Ascendant> It's interesting looking through the various distros
<Ascendant> because you pick out new things and learn
<Ghosties> 4Well, obviously not right now :P
<Ghosties> 4But at some point in the future
<HyperMetalLugia> Well I'd like to pick one thing that everyone else uses and writes programs for :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Plus way more tech support
<SirSprinkles> 6...and Silver left...
<Ghosties> 4Yup
<Ascendant> who needs tech support?

<RainBroDash> I'm blasting insane drum n bass in an HD gaming headset. Turns out this was a great idea
<Ascendant> so can linux in general
<drf|PartedMagic> zipzipzipzipzip
<drf|PartedMagic> and that may be true
<drf|PartedMagic> but eh
<Ascendant> parted magic IS linux
<drf|PartedMagic> I know
<drf|PartedMagic> it's the programs on it that make it special
<Ascendant> so yeah :p
<drf|PartedMagic> especially clonezilla
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> heh
<drf|PartedMagic> you can't install that normally
<drf|PartedMagic> you have to do all this crap
<drf|PartedMagic> I looked on how to install it on ubuntu
<Ascendant> well
<Ghosties> 4Thank god my neighbors aren't blasting their bass this evening
<drf|PartedMagic> it was like a 4 page guide
<drf|PartedMagic> on it
<Ascendant> the general process for installing something on linux
<Ascendant> is basically
<Ascendant> wget craphere && tar xvzf craphere && cd craphere && ./configure && make && sudo make install
<RainBroDash> baha. I think that's what MY neighbours are saying right now. Except they mean tonight, and by tonight they mean 4:17am
<drf|PartedMagic> LOL wget
<drf|PartedMagic> you could also use a browser
<Ascendant> unless you're doing it via pacman
<SirSprinkles> 6Back
<RainBroDash> wb sprinks
<Ascendant> true but I'm lazy
<Ascendant> and I'm more use to shells and crap
<Ascendant> I <3 my boxes
<Pattyrick> Velveeta with shell noodles
<Ascendant> I even have one with RHEL on it
<drf|PartedMagic> <Ascendant> I <3 my boxes <- get rid of the "es" and that's totally what she said
<Ghosties> 4I will guarantee you that Hipster has posted in every single thread on /meta/ while at least being in the last three shown posts for at least half of the threads on the front page

<Ascendant> and 3 windows servers
<SilverSonic> o-o
<drf|PartedMagic> aww, no botnets?
<RainBroDash> He was on the front page 5 times last I checked
<Ascendant> I lost my login for the one I had one on
*Ascendant hides
<drf|PartedMagic> hm
<RainBroDash> *in the most recent posts that appear
<drf|PartedMagic> apparently Mibbit uses the system time
<drf|PartedMagic> as my computer thinks it's 3:19am right now
<Ascendant> yeah it does
<drf|PartedMagic> when it's only 11:19pm
<Ascendant> nearly everything does
<drf|PartedMagic> I just dont' care
<drf|PartedMagic> because this is partedmagic
<drf|PartedMagic> hm
<drf|PartedMagic> Ascendant
<Ascendant> ?
<drf|PartedMagic> is there a way
<drf|PartedMagic> via linux cli
<drf|PartedMagic> to change system time
<drf|PartedMagic> and I mean
<drf|PartedMagic> actual hardware
<drf|PartedMagic> like the chip on the motherboard
<drf|PartedMagic> that keeps the time
<Ascendant> time timehere or something
<RainBroDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6fezelfJzw
<drf|PartedMagic> hmb
<drf|PartedMagic> because
<drf|PartedMagic> for some stupid reason
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> oh
<drf|PartedMagic> my Droid's time is like 3 hours off
<Pattyrick> my computer's motherboard probably got damaged while being shipped here to Italy
<SirSprinkles> 6The html is making me cry right now...
<Ascendant> well
<drf|PartedMagic> it changes itself when it gets the correct time from Verizon
<Ascendant> you need to edit a file
<drf|PartedMagic> but if I use the backup manager
<RainBroDash> just for your audiophilic enjoyment
<drf|PartedMagic> which is completely independent of the wireless
<drf|PartedMagic> it gets the times wrong
<drf|PartedMagic> :/
<RainBroDash> and @sprinkles lol
<drf|PartedMagic> hm
<drf|PartedMagic> what file
<Ascendant> or you can use date
<Ascendant> but date is like
<drf|PartedMagic> I don't want to date my phone
<drf|PartedMagic> I only date people
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<drf|PartedMagic> which brings up?:
<drf|PartedMagic> -?
<drf|PartedMagic> Carbon dating
<drf|PartedMagic> sounds gross
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> well

<drf|PartedMagic> the circular one with the stars
<Ascendant> to change the date to the 5th of july, 1:22pm
<drf|PartedMagic> I need that isolated
<drf|PartedMagic> if that makes sense
<drf|PartedMagic> o.o
<drf|PartedMagic> and a lot bigger
<Ghosties> 4What genre is this?

<drf|PartedMagic> biggest I can find
<drf|PartedMagic> I dunno if it's possible to like, trace over it or sometihng
<Aurora> 6isolated....meaning you want just that logo?
<drf|PartedMagic> right
<drf|PartedMagic> with a clear or white background
<Aurora> 6http://www.bitblokes.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/parted-magic-logo-150x150.png

<drf|PartedMagic> yeah well
<drf|PartedMagic> 150x150

<Ascendant> http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/time.html @ drf
<drf|PartedMagic> uh
<drf|PartedMagic> maybe like twice that size? 300x300 or so?

<Aurora> 6http://www.artrinsic.com/files/gimgs/11_partedmagic02.jpg
<RainBroDash> the artist calls it DNBStep
<Aurora> 6something like that wont work will it?
<RainBroDash> it's practically drum n bass
<drf|PartedMagic> that's a different picture LOL
<drf|PartedMagic> that one looks like pacman
<HyperMetalLugia> LolPacman
<drf|PartedMagic> but yeah
<drf|PartedMagic> what I'm trying to do though
<drf|PartedMagic> is find the actual image file on the filesystem
<drf|PartedMagic> as I'm sure it exists
<RainBroDash> it's dirty as fuck, but unlike genres like dubstep which tend to be slower it has that AMAZING hyped up beat from 1:31 onwards
<Ascendant> http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems
<Ascendant> I so want to do that
<drf|PartedMagic> god dang it
<drf|PartedMagic> I hate linux search
<Ascendant> lol
<drf|PartedMagic> it's so awful
<drf|PartedMagic> I can't even sort by size
<Ascendant> linux's search function is actually decent
<drf|PartedMagic> not the one I'm using o.o
<RainBroDash> I went to this club in london which was basically a massive bunker 3 floors underground with three stages of live artists playing music like this, they had subwoofers in the fucking floor man. Ohmydays best day of my life

<SilverSonic> o_O
<SirSprinkles> 6That wasn't even the worst of it, since that's not really spaghetti html, it's just repetitive and unnecessary.
<SirSprinkles> 6Spaghetti is when you have million tags intertwined to where it's a pain to find where they begin and end.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, brb
<RainBroDash> just copypaste into Notepad++ and hover over the tags :3
<RainBroDash> kk :D

<SirSprinkles> Dari
<SirSprinkles> How do you use the scripts for the color and flood kickers?
<SirSprinkles> In case you aren't able to show again or something.
<prince-dari> I wrote the script on mIRC, so you could use it on there, although I'm fairly sure that all proper IRC clients (not mibbit) will work with it too.
*SirSprinkles knows nothing of scripts
<SirSprinkles> lol not mibbit
<prince-dari> You just have to copy-paste it into the scripts window.
<SirSprinkles> Well, I've been needing to get a better client for when I'm streaming anyway...
<SirSprinkles> ...how would I go about getting mIRC?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Night everyone
<SirSprinkles> If you know of links, so I don't have to... search for things.
<prince-dari> Google mIRC download then click the first link. :P
<prince-dari> Ok, fine.
<SirSprinkles> XD
<SirSprinkles> If you don't know offhand I can look.
<prince-dari> Since you got inB4 me I'll get you the link. :P
<SirSprinkles> ...are you a wizard?
<SirSprinkles> How'd you get it that fast?
<prince-dari> Google. :P

<prince-dari> You could go get icechat or something else.
<prince-dari> I've never used any of the other clients though.
<Ascendant> I see a mass kick

<Ghosties> 4Mod chat mang
<prince-dari> I have no idea.
<Ghosties> As far as I was aware, Hipster wanted /oat/ and /chat/ to be merged
<Elision> hey guys what's going on this
<Elision> oh
<Ghosties> I never saw him say anything about wanting /oat/ to be random, but, then again, I don't pay nearly enough attention to /meta/
<SirSprinkles> I have... no idea when this happened.
<SirSprinkles> inb4 lol today
<RainBroDash> D:
<Ghosties> I just read that thread over on /meta/ where he responded to you
