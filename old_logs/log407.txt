<Umbreon> okay
<Umbreon> hmm
<Syrune> Ascendant: He doesn't have a $strip just a if (drf isin $2)

<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a Aron.
<Syrune> >|
<Umbreon> okay
<Umbreon> enough with the binary
<Sato> 01110111011010000111100100111111 (why ?)
<Umbreon> because it's awfully spammy
<Sato> it's a way of life
<Umbreon> just because it's a way of life doesn't mean it shouldn't be controlled :P
<NightSeas> 12like saying derp?
<NightSeas> 12derp
<Umbreon> nah
<Umbreon> that just gets you kicked by drf
<Sato> I wonder...
<HyperMetalLugia> 011000100110100101101110011000010111001001111001001000000111001101110101011000110110101101110011 :D
<NightSeas> 12OMZG APPLE IS AMAZING
<Umbreon> gah HyperMetalLugia
<Umbreon> not you too
*NightSeas runs
<Kosoveon> Umbreon, if you want a legal justification
<NightSeas> 12that's what will get you kicked XD
<Kosoveon> just reference Reynolds v. United States :D
*Kosoveon runs
<HyperMetalLugia> wat
<Umbreon> o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> who
<Umbreon> nah if you truely want to get kicked
<Kosoveon> it's a supreme court case that because says religious convictions can't be used to justify criminal offenses :P
<Umbreon> you need to say you are a brony
<Umbreon> hmm
<Umbreon> !mlp
<Umbreon> nah he hasn't made one of those yet
<NightSeas> 12!Pony
<NightSeas> 12!Ponies
<drf|laptop> 03I should, actually
<derp> does not HyperMetalLugia
<Kosoveon> but Umbreon
<Kosoveon> binary is illegal in micronesia
<Kosoveon> and Samoa
<Umbreon> what
<derp> so all tech is too?
<Kosoveon> and some other island I can't name
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 Tokelau
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<drf|laptop> 03that's like my favorite island ever
<drf|laptop> 03because they'give away free domain names
<NightSeas> 12tbh, MLP is starting to irritate me :/
<drf|laptop> 03Only starting to?
<NightSeas> 12I already dislike the fan base
<Umbreon> mlp has been out for ages
<Umbreon> cough yugioh cough
<Sato> MLP is ancient
<NightSeas> 12MLP FiM
<Sato> Dexter's Lab made fun of it
<Kosoveon> it can be found in hierogyphics
<Umbreon> look at the similarities btween MLP FiM and yugioh
<Kosoveon> wait what
<Umbreon> they both go on and on and on about the power of friendship
<NightSeas> 12LOL
<Sato> yugioh is about friendship?
<Sato> well that's just crazy
<Kosoveon> doesn't Pokemon (the anime) have friendship as one of, if not the main theme?
<Kosoveon> *s
<drf|laptop> 03Well
<drf|laptop> 03if you consider pitting one against another in order to win competitions as friendship
<drf|laptop> 03then sure
*drf|laptop hides
<NightSeas> 12most shows do
<Kosoveon> NightSeas
<Kosoveon> I doubt friendship is a main theme on 24
*Kosoveon runs
<Umbreon> o-O
<Kosoveon> !umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to Kosoveon for 14 minutes
<Umbreon> friendship is always the theme of everyshow
<NightSeas> 12well, a lot of shows, not all XD
<NightSeas> 12If I got to make a show, friendship wouldn't be the them :>
*NightSeas runs
<NightSeas> 12theme*
<NightSeas> 12anyhow, night everyone
<Kosoveon> night
<NightSeas> 12And when NS get back I’d like to set up a bouncer
<NightSeas> 12gets*
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Ascendant> I am back
<Umbreon> night
<drf|laptop> 03why does everybody use one of those now :|
<drf|laptop> 03it's so unoriginal
<Ascendant> what's your point
<Sato> bouncer ?
<NightSeas> 12hurr
<Kosoveon> yeah
<Sato> what's that
<Kosoveon> they should go back to the original 151 bouncers
<drf|laptop> 03real pros just keep their computers on 24/7
<Kosoveon> I mean
<Kosoveon> hi
<Ascendant> there's no rule against it
*Kosoveon runs
<NightSeas> 12well in that case, when I get back XD
<drf|laptop> 03it's like an IRC proxy
<Ascendant> drf, you live in america :|
<Ascendant> I don't
<Ascendant> I have limited bw
<drf|laptop> 03I know there's not a rule against it, it's just annoying when you see everybody using bouncers since it gives the false impression that they're actually here, a la Feather :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Butbut
<HyperMetalLugia> I say away in my name
<HyperMetalLugia> ;<
<Sato> ^
<HyperMetalLugia> and it makes it obvious I'm not here
<Sato> that works
<drf|laptop> 03I still don't see the point LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> my internet fails often
<NightSeas> 12anyhow, night
<Sato> clears up the confusion
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<drf|laptop> 03well you're special
<Drake> 04use bouncers when you need logs
<drf|laptop> 03but for people like me, bouncers would be completely pointless
<Drake> 04otherwise just dc
<Aurora> 6uh
<Aurora> 6why
<Sato> if that desktop can stay on without getting overheated I'll do IRC on that
<Aurora> 6am I still awake
<Aurora> 6ffff
<Kosoveon> Aurora
<Drake> 04because everything steven bree Aurora
<drf|laptop> 03Sato it shouldn't overheat
<Kosoveon> how was the hunger games movie lol
<Sato> even with 8?
<Aurora> 6drake
<Aurora> 6that sentence made no sense
<Aurora> 6at all lol
<Sato> I plan on dual booting
<Aurora> 6it made me happy but lol
<Drake> 04YOUR FACE MAKES NO SENSE
<drf|laptop> 03the hardware is what makes it overheat, not software o.o
<Aurora> 6so does your foot
<Drake> 04I know
<Drake> 04it's embarrassing
<Drake> 04But not as much as your face
<Drake> 04The only person who you'll ever marry is Kosovo
<Sato> the demand the software has is what I'm getting at
<Ascendant> <%drf|laptop> I know there's not a rule against it, it's just annoying when you see everybody using bouncers since it gives the false impression that they're actually here, a la Feather :P
<Drake> 04Because HE'S YOUR SOULMATE
<Sato> how hard it pushes your system
*Ascendant shrugs
<HyperMetalLugia> Kill feather!
<drf|laptop> 03that and it makes everybody show up as a clone LOL
<Sato> feather
<Aurora> 6koso, it was pretty...um.
<Aurora> 6dunno if you read my critique of it on forums
<Aurora> 6I basically hated it
<Ascendant> you want clones? I'll give you 1200 of them
<Kosoveon> I hadn't checked the-
<Sato> actually USPS then drf
<Kosoveon> oh
<Kosoveon> :/
<Aurora> 6so much potential, lost due to poor cinematography choices
<drf|laptop> 03that's the spirit, hate everything :D
<Sato> multi-shadow clone jutsu?
<Aurora> 6not even related to the story
<Drake> 04shut up we don't need another drf
<Sato> @ Ascendant
<Aurora> 6and I don't hate everything
*Drake runs
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but you should
*drf|laptop hides
<Aurora> 6I actually have open mind on most everything
<Aurora> 6hell no lol
<drf|laptop> 03and Drake :(
<Ascendant> nope, IRC spambots
<drf|laptop> 03We need more drf's
<Kosoveon> I guess that's a "director's vision vs. reader's vision" thing
<Drake> 04no
<Drake> 04we don't
<Drake> 04at all
<Drake> 04ever
<Drake> 04again
<Drake> 04forever
<Drake> 04infinitum
<drf|laptop> 03>:(
<Drake> 04eternum
<Ascendant> drf, d'you want spambots?
<drf|laptop> 03no?
<Ascendant> I can get them to PM you too ^_^
<Sato> are you the matrix Ascendant ?
<drf|laptop> 03unless you can...yea
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03spam #PM
<Aurora> 6koso
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03I misread that
<Ascendant> I am the one.
<drf|laptop> 03but spambots on #PM
<drf|laptop> 03is fine
<Aurora> 6the director decided that camera shake for effect was necessary for every single scene
<Ascendant> nah
<drf|laptop> 03also make them all @find and !list
*drf|laptop runs
<Kosoveon> OH
<Aurora> 6only like 4 scenes in 2 hours had still camera
<Drake> 04Aurora that makes me think of RED: Darkside Chronicles
<drf|laptop> 03LOL shaky camera
<Kosoveon> I thought you mean like landscapes and scenery and stuff
<Kosoveon> in that case yeah that's dumb
<Aurora> 6and the camera shake was HORRIBLE.
<drf|laptop> 03Star Trek has that problem
<Kosoveon> >_<
<drf|laptop> 03but it's a good movie
<Aurora> 6nononono I was really impressed with the sets
<Drake> 04no drf
<Sato> Star Trek 2 is coming though right?
<Kosoveon> I HATE movies that do that.
<drf|laptop> 03it basically comes down to
<drf|laptop> 03EVERYONE'S A CRITIC
<Drake> 04Star Trek had problem with Lens Flare
*Drake runs
<drf|laptop> 03lens flare and shaky camera
<drf|laptop> 03both of those
<drf|laptop> 03but I still loved it
<Sato> it's coming 2013
<drf|laptop> 03I care more about story than anything LOL
<Drake> 04same
<Kosoveon> I remember watching Cloverfield when it first came out
<Kosoveon> and hating it
<drf|laptop> 03honestly, the trailer for that movie
<drf|laptop> 03OK well
<drf|laptop> 03Cloverfield
<Kosoveon> for exactly that reason
<drf|laptop> 03is a retarded movie
<Drake> 04Unless the camera is HORRIBLY DODGY I care more about the story
<Sato> Iron Man
<drf|laptop> 03it's basically "monster attacks people"
<Drake> 04Iron Sky looks frikkin' hilarious
<drf|laptop> 03that's like a 10-second story
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<Kosoveon> aside from the fact that the story was dumb etc.
<Kosoveon> the camera
<Ascendant> I hate ircnet so much
<Kosoveon> made me physically sick
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant it probably hates you too
<Sato> Iron Man 2 was better than 1 though
<drf|laptop> 03I disagree
<drf|laptop> 03I liked the original Iron Man better
<Kosoveon> ^
<Sato> how is Iron Man 3 looking to you?
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03I have no idea?
<Kosoveon> OH aurora
<Kosoveon> I've played kid icarus
<Kosoveon> for like
<Kosoveon> 11 hours
<Kosoveon> since friday
<Kosoveon> and I actually really enjoy it
<Kosoveon> the controls don't really bother me at all
<Aurora> 6lol
<drf|laptop> 03my mom thought that was a movie
<Sato> The Avengers (2012) looks good
<Kosoveon> the only thing that bother me is the camera
<drf|laptop> 03when she saw the preview
<Kosoveon> because you control it by flicking the bottom screen with the stylus
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Kosoveon> and whoever thought of that should be fired
<Aurora> 6wuh
<drf|laptop> 03>Nintendo
<Kosoveon> but other than that
<Sato> just hope they balance the characters well
<Aurora> 6that sounds horrible
<drf|laptop> 03I love when
<Kosoveon> it's pretty good
<drf|laptop> 03people start fighting me when I say how much Nintendo sucks
<drf|laptop> 03but then at some point they're forced to agree
<drf|laptop> 03:D
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> :?
<Sato> I've not caved yet drf|laptop
<Kosoveon> nintendo made a stupid decision with that
<drf|laptop> 03they're just nowhere near as good as they were in the 80s LOL
<drf|laptop> 03and 90s
<Kosoveon> but it's easy to look past because the game is amazing
<Sato> !ew Playstation Vita
<drf|away> 02EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW PLAYSTATION VITA
<drf|laptop> 03hey, at least the Vita has been hacked
<Sato> those were your words not mine man
<Umbreon> drf's logic
<Umbreon> if it can't be hacked, it's horrible
<Kosoveon> but yeah I recommend it
<drf|laptop> 03Umbreon, true that
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Sato> Nintendo 3DS might be getting automatic updates :D
<drf|laptop> 03unless it actually allows open development without needing to be hacked
<drf|laptop> 03a la Android
<Kosoveon> and now I'm highly considering getting spirit camera as well
<drf|laptop> 03EW AUTOMATIC UPDATES
<drf|laptop> 03Unless they're something like Windows
<Sato> less power to the player
<drf|laptop> 03as those don't acutally go around removing your software >_>
<Umbreon> lol
<drf|laptop> 03Nintendo's updates are like
<drf|laptop> 03"Let's call it a 'security fix' and then remove all their mods :D"
<drf|laptop> 03They've done it several times now >_>
<Umbreon> are you supposed to have those mods?
<drf|laptop> 03very carefully®
<Sato> Nintendo 3DS will be difficult to hack
<Umbreon> lol trademark
<drf|laptop> 03I like doing that Umbreon
<drf|laptop> 03same with just works®
<drf|laptop> 03they're expressions I stole from people :P
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<Sato> if Nintendo is plugging the holes as they go
<Kosoveon> Carefully is a registered trademark of Game freak (c) software
<Umbreon> hmm
*Kosoveon runs
<drf|laptop> 03you mean ©?
<drf|laptop> 03go set your keyboard to US International already
*drf|laptop hides
<Sato> they're plugging holes that hackers can't find even
<drf|laptop> 03ó.Ô
<Umbreon> !ew d®f
<drf|away> 02EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW D®F
<drf|laptop> 03erm
<drf|laptop> 03ó.ô
<drf|laptop> 03Sato, that's also because the 3DS has a very small hacking community
<drf|laptop> 03given that most people who actually like gaming don't give a crap about the 3DS :P
<Sato> drf is a registered trademark of the cynical people of the world foundation
<drf|laptop> 03the Xbox 360 has probably the biggest hacking community of all systems hence why people keep exploiting it after the updates
<Sato> still no softmod
<drf|laptop> 03and second biggest are probably the iPhone/Android people
<drf|laptop> 03who do jailbreak/root hacks
<Sato> still hoping though
<drf|laptop> 03Sato, it's impossible to softmod
<Sato> I will softmod my 360 S so fast
<HyperMetalLugia> ìsëé
<drf|laptop> 03it's never going to happen.
<Sato> the moment the exploit is found
<drf|laptop> 03you can reset glitch (equivalent to JTAG) it
<drf|laptop> 03or just flash the DVD rdive to play burned games
<Sato> I have google news alerts up for it that never changes
<Sato> never any new stories
<Sato> don't you think the same was thought of Wii drf?
<Sato> that we couldn't softmod it
<Aurora> 6well
<HyperMetalLugia> Took 2 years with the Wii
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Aurora> 6since the topic seems to have turned to nintendo once again
<Aurora> 6I'll take my leave and go to bed
<Kosoveon> good night rawra
<Sato> Aurora really hates Nintendo apparently
<Kosoveon> :>
<Sato> hmm
<drf|laptop> 03Sato, the difference is that the Xbox 360 runs an actual operating system :P
<Sato> touche
<drf|laptop> 03Sato, *I* really hate Nintendo too
<drf|laptop> 03but anywa
<drf|laptop> 03y
<Sato> you don't leave when the topic comes up though
<Aurora> 6.
<Aurora> 6I leave because I'm tired
<Umbreon> night Aurora D:
<Aurora> 6and because you've exhausted the nintendo topic entirely.
<drf|laptop> 03the reason the Xbox 360 will never be softmodded is because the system actually does security checks against its software, same goes with the 3DS
<Aurora> 6koso
<drf|laptop> 03the Wii was supposed to but didn't in all cases
<Aurora> 6before I go
<Sato> hey did Aurora have some comeback to that
<Aurora> 6whats the weather
<drf|laptop> 03so someone found an instance where you didn't need a signed program
<Sato> I have her on ignore
<Aurora> 6lol
<drf|laptop> 03and that's how the hacks were formed
<Umbreon> !w 54650
<ScriptBot> Onalaska, WI: Partly Cloudy and 54°F(12°C)
<Aurora> 6good
<HyperMetalLugia> Fail.
<Kosoveon> it was rathhhher
<Kosoveon> sunny today actually
<Kosoveon> not hot but warmish
<Aurora> 6lol
<drf|laptop> 03the Xbox 360 actually reports if you're running unsigned code though
<Aurora> !w 95023
<ScriptBot> Hollister, CA: rain mist and 47°F(8°C)
<drf|laptop> 03so that means you *can* run softmods but Microsoft will know and ban your console :P
<Sato> hmm so an exploit wouldn't be easy
<Aurora> 6it's raining
<Kosoveon> thank god too because I was getting sick of the heat lol
<Aurora> 6so beautiful
<Kosoveon> !w Anaheim
<ScriptBot> Anaheim, CA: Scattered Clouds and 57°F(14°C)
<drf|laptop> 03it would be possible if you don't connect it to the Internet
<Aurora> 6and 47
<Sato> I don't care if my console gets banned
<Aurora> 6is so nice
<drf|laptop> 03but how many people use their Xboxes offline?
<drf|laptop> 03that defeats the purpose LOL
<drf|laptop> 03honestly the whole fun of the Xbox 360 is Xbox LIVE :P
<Sato> I'll play on the J-Tag servers
<drf|laptop> 03jtag requires hardmod dudce
<drf|laptop> 03*dude
<Sato> I'll play on the non-existent I'm screwed servers
<Kosoveon> the breeze is
<drf|laptop> 03what you can do is what I'm trying to get done for me, and that's a dual NAN|D
<drf|laptop> 03@*NAND
<Kosoveon> nice
<drf|laptop> 03it'll have a switch on it
<drf|laptop> 03to switch between JTAG and non-JTAG
<junh1024-XD> who Seiga Kaku r.
<drf|laptop> 03so you can run homebrew and then just switch it back to normal to play online
<Kosoveon> although before friday
<Kosoveon> it was like
<drf|laptop> 03best of both worlds
<Kosoveon> raining
<Kosoveon> *hard*
<Sato> wait so if Microsoft bans your console they just ban your NAND?
<drf|laptop> 03they ban the console ID

<Ascendant> Sato
<drf|laptop> 03since I can't solder

<Ascendant> Yeah you do, but you have to respect their wishes
<Kosoveon> sato, you targeting people is not okay
<Drake> 04^
<Aurora> 6except you purposely instigate attacks on me
<Sato> I have infracted on no single rule
<Aurora> 6yes attacks, when I've asked you to stop, and then you turn around and do this: http://mibpaste.com/v15XLY
<Kosoveon> sato
<Kosoveon> if a person asks you to stop
<Kosoveon> there should not have to be a rule
<Kosoveon> to make you stop.
<Kosoveon> it's called respect
<Sato> I'm so scared of your big bad logs
<Kyu> 07that works
<Drake> 04You should be.
<Aurora> 6 2. No flaming other people/websites. We understand that you can't be forced into liking everything/everyone but if you do encounter something you dislike, don't go out of your way to cause trouble.
<Drake> 04/bond one liner
<Ascendant> I banned him just then
<Aurora> 6 18. Respect other people's wishes. If they want you to leave them alone, please leave them alone.

<Ascendant> I showed the first one to him
<Ascendant> Second one I didn't bother since it's common sense
<Ascendant> As for logs
<Aurora> 6the second one was awkwardly perfect though

<Drake> 04Classic NS, right there.
<Ascendant> no problems Aurora, he was being an annoying bastard
<Aurora> 6lol
<Ascendant> and he was breaking rules and what he said to and about you was pissing me off
<junh1024-XD> except drf is in the middle of sending stuff to him
<Ascendant> oh well

<Drake> 04As far as I can tell NS doesn't have IRL stalkers
<Ascendant> let me show you one example of an idiot

<Guest45512> hello?
<NightSeas> 12DERP
<NightSeas> 12ohai there
<Guest45512> can i connect to other servers too?
<NightSeas> 12yep
<Guest45512> may i have the command plz
<NightSeas> 12oh wait, you're using mibbit. In that case I wouldn't know
<NightSeas> 12/server might work
<Google> You can specify custom servers to connect to pre-connect on Mibbit.
<drf|away> 03so, I'm seeing The Hunger Games movie later today
<Nickario> back
<HyperMetalLugia> WB
<HyperMetalLugia> My sisters and mother went
<Aurora> 6drf do you get motio sickness
<NightSeas> 12nice drf
<Aurora> 6motion
<Guest45512> yeah it my first time being in here
<drf|away> 03uh
<HyperMetalLugia> they'll be back soon
<drf|away> 03not usually
<Aurora> 6k
<Google> http://prntscr.com/7ek3v/direct
<drf|away> 03we're seeing it in IMAX
<Google> As such.
<Guest45512> will i get logged out here?
<drf|away> 03so I sure hope I don't :P
<Aurora> 6thats been a problem with this movie cuz of the crazy camera shaking
<Guest45512> disconnect or something
<drf|away> 03we're going like an hour early so we can fight off rabid fangirls to get good seats :|
<Aurora> 6lol
<drf|away> 03but yay smartphones, I'll just be on IRC or something
<Aurora> 6I'm gonna assume the rabid fangirls were there at midnight
<NightSeas> 12They did as kind of a censor
<drf|away> 03movie's at 6:45 I think
<drf|away> 03Aurora, all weekend
<NightSeas> 12that as*
<Google> Most likely this current connection, yes; unless you use a new server tab/connection.
<drf|away> 03the movie was selling out even for SUnday
<drf|away> 03that and it's IMAX so more people want to see it
<Aurora> 6I still hate that all the twitard fangirls migrated to hunger games
<drf|away> 03LOL
<drf|away> 03I just hate fangirls in general
<Aurora> 6so the /normal/ fans are now surrounded by them.
<drf|away> 03because they tend to follow anything that's popular
<drf|away> 03:P
<Aurora> 6yeh
<drf|away> 03I mean
<drf|away> 03we saw the movie 21 Jump Street last night, and when we were leaving there was a HUGE line for THG
<drf|away> 03and that was just a regular theater, not anything special
<drf|away> 03so yeah, it sells out so much that the fangirls fill up basically all weekend XD
<Aurora> 6ok so
<NightSeas> 12when usig mibbit using mibbit I just open another tab for more servers
<Aurora> 6midnight showing for my theater
<NightSeas> 12-usig
<Aurora> 6we bought tickets when they decided to make two showings instead of one
<Google> Another browser tab
<Google> ?
<Aurora> 6we get there that night, there are 8 separate lines
<NightSeas> 12yep
<Aurora> 6EIGHT SHOWINGS.
<drf|away> 03LOL
<drf|away> 03wow
<Google> Baka, etc.
<drf|away> 03see, that wouldn't work at this theater
<Espeon> wtf
<Espeon> lol
<drf|away> 03as there's only one IMAX
<Guest45512> oh ok
<Aurora> 6that was ridiculous lol
<drf|away> 03so my friend bought tickets this morning
<Google> You can have multiple server connections in a single mibbit instance.
<drf|away> 03it's prolly sold out already
<NightSeas> 12when using mibbit*
<NightSeas> 12asd
<drf|away> 03but wow
<drf|away> 03my friend was telling me
<drf|away> 03that they had to cut some stuff in order to not get an R rating
<drf|away> 03is it really that violent? LOL
<drf|away> 03I mean, I know the concept of kids fighting each other is
<drf|away> 03but somehow THG struck me as a kids' series
<Guest45512> is that good?
<Aurora> 6drf yeh

<Aurora> 6it was severely cut down
<Nickario> at about 5:20 there's me askig the question
<Aurora> 6and probably one reason why the camera shaking is so bad
<Nickario> arti and rn got to ask first lol
<Aurora> 6the book has some pretty gruesome deaths
<Google> Multiple server connections in a single mibbit instance is better than several browser tabs for a single server connection each.
<Aurora> 6after all, they are kids killing each other
<drf|away> 03that's what surprised me about Prince Caspian, a dude got beheaded and it was still PG
<Aurora> 6uh
<Aurora> 6wait
<Aurora> 6what part was that
<drf|away> 03when they were all fighting
<drf|away> 03Nickario

<Nickario> yeah
<drf|away> 03Nice
<drf|away> 03So envious :P
<NightSeas> 12it was the part Aurora
<drf|away> 03I recognized her voice LOL
<Nickario> and rn immediately after
*NightSeas runs
<drf|away> 03yeah I've never talked to RN so I didn't know her voice
<NightSeas> 12I actually don’t remember that
<Google> OH GOD THE WHOPURGIS NIGHT HAS BEGUN.
<Google> Skylands is watching me.
<drf|away> 03it's when uh
<NightSeas> 12then again, I only watched it once
<Nickario> lol I thought I sounded stuttery I was nervous xD
<drf|away> 03I'm trying to remember, it was such a long movie
<drf|away> 03I remember the one guy was on a horse with a sword
<drf|away> 03fighting people
<drf|away> 03and someone chops his head off with their sword
<drf|away> 03the camera cuts away a little but you can still see it
<NightSeas> 12XD
<NightSeas> 12I must have went to the bathroom or something during that part
<drf|away> 03LOL spam email

<HyperMetalLugia> lame excuse
<HyperMetalLugia> that is all.
<HyperMetalLugia> I've been on 4 servers on a laptop and lived without nickalert :P
<Ray> 02Sure, because you don't do stuff while on IRC
<HyperMetalLugia> Just click al the shiny red tabs
<Ray> 02mostly because I hate to keep people waiting
<NightSeas> 12Blu-Ray :D
<Soital> 12but your name can mean be used in normal terms like ray of light o.e
<Ray> 02and w/o it could take anywhere from 3 minutes to 4 hours to give respone
<HyperMetalLugia> ray

<drf|laptop> 03HD-DVD was awesome
<NightSeas> 12HD DVD isn't the same thing

<Viri> 14I'm with drf :3
<Drake> 04I agree drf
<Viri> 14they should have done just one Guitar Hero with like 10000 DLC of songs xD

<drf-Droid> they blurred out the good stuff though :<
*drf-Droid runs
<drf-Droid> some show called Apt. 23
<Viri> 14I have "Apple" as nick in the first one, "Pear" in the second and "Potato" in the third
<Viri> 14how do I preserve them in case I disconnect?
<drf-Droid> uh
<drf-Droid> I can help later
<Viri> 14:D
<drf-Droid> currently I have like 2% battery so I'll d/c anytime :/
<Angel_Espeon> 13you will work that battery dry ;3
<Ascendant> Viri
<Ascendant> when you connect, /server -m server.irc.com -i nick altnick
<Ascendant> for each network
<Ascendant> that way the nicks are preserved
<Ascendant> the -i switch sets the nicks
<Ascendant> And drf, he continuously attacked Aurora, refused to listen when I told him to stop it, and then argued with users and staff in here
<Viri> 14o.o
<Ascendant> so I banned him
<Viri> 14thank you :D
<Ascendant> then he tried to ban evade at least 12 times
*Angel_Espeon celebrates
<Nickario> wait you mean sato got banned?
<Ascendant> My BOPM got around 10 of them, I banned him a few seconds after he connected for an IP that didn't hit the DNSBLs, and then banned the user info he used to connect with
<Ascendant> Yes Nick
<Skylands> 10Ascendant
*Nickario parties with angel
<Ascendant> i'm still in contact with him
<Skylands> 10When he evaded, did he use the same nick or a different one?
<Ascendant> if any of you need/want to talk
<Skylands> 10If same nick, what an idiot
<Ascendant> he used the same nick, switched once
<Ascendant> which is how I figured out it was him
<Skylands> 10Wow.
<Ascendant> I ended up banning the second nick
<Ascendant> and he was like "how did you figure out it was me?"
<Skylands> 10Did he say anything when evading?
<Skylands> 10in main chan, that is
<Viri> 14uhm
<Ascendant> he used Goomba and FearLaRoxas

<drf-Droid> oh there
<drf-Droid> bbl guys x.x
<Kosoveon> that guy had it coming
<Ascendant> Well, he refused to listen
<Kosoveon> indeed
<nickstr> I might actually join the forum
<Kimori> what? skylanders?
<Ascendant> Even though I told him several times in the main channel to stop it
<Ascendant> And he was horribly stubborn in PM as well
<nickstr> I was reading some sections as a guest and it looks interesting
<Ascendant> he was all "I will not be changing my conduct"
<Kosoveon> that and he had a disregard for basic respect for other people, even in light of rules that actually spell that out.
<Suinide> Yeah, i would kick so much ass

<Chimera> Anyone wanna help me with trig homework?
<Chimera> XP
<Aeroslash> no thanks lol, that hurts my brain
<Aeroslash> XD
<Kosoveon> what kind of trig are you doing chimera?
<Kimori> I'm sure youd get some competition
<Kosoveon> solving trig equations, polar equations, proofs?
*Aeroslash is officially lost
<Aeroslash> off to work on govt homeworks
<Chimera> lolk
<Chimera> um
<Suinide> I know but still, it would be sweet
<Chimera> here's the problem
<Kimori> yeah it would
<Suinide> Itd be no fun if i always beat everybody :
<Suinide> :ap
<Suinide> :p
<Chimera> If Cos A = -3/5, find cos 2 A and express in simplest form.
<Suinide> Good lord i have 31 skylanders total jow
<Suinide> Now
<Suinide> Plus 9 extra things
<Kosoveon> well, you'd have to do cos^-1(3/5) to find the angle, although there are actually two possible angles
<Kimori> your pretty committed to it
<Kimori> I haven't tried getting anymore skylanders stuff lately
<Suinide> I am. How come?
<Aeroslash> find Kos? ok ^^ *huggles Kos*
<Chimera> wait
<Chimera> lolz
<Chimera> anyway
<Chimera> find arc cosine of 3/5?
*Kosoveon hugs back
<Kosoveon> yes
<Chimera> but it's - 3/5
<Chimera> that's what's confusing me owo
<Kosoveon> I believe that means the angle is negative
<Aeroslash> o.o
<Kosoveon> for example
<Aeroslash> angles can be negative?
<Chimera> yeah
<Kosoveon> -30 is the same as 330
<Chimera> that confused me too
<Chimera> oh
<Chimera> hahaha imma derp
<Aeroslash> omg this is why I got a C+ in Geometry sophmore year
<Aeroslash> math dislikes me strongly
<Chimera> well see Koso
<Chimera> this is what my teacher told me to do
<Chimera> make a triangle and write the numbers on the sides
<Chimera> like
<Chimera> one angle would be A
<Kosoveon> that works too
<Chimera> and since I got Cos 3/5
<Kosoveon> because cos a is adj/opp
<Chimera> I'd do adj/hyp
<Chimera> hyp
<Chimera> not opposite
<Chimera> silly kos
<Kosoveon> oh, right
<Chimera> ;P
<Chimera> that would be tangent
<Chimera> anyway yeah
<Chimera> so after I have that
<Kosoveon> no, that'd be cotangent ;p
<Kosoveon> I think
<Chimera> oh
<Kosoveon> because tangent is opp/adj
<Kosoveon> ;3
<Chimera> nonono
<Chimera> yeah
<Chimera> cotanj is um

<Suinide> Although imo terrafin and sunburn are both better skylanders
<Kosoveon> and wholesome
<Suinide> IMO
<Soital> 12I haven't had milk in a long time
<Angel_Espeon> 13I got plenty of that if you want some ;3

<Kosoveon> it's a test
<Kimori> Is there some other ship level adventure pack?
<Kosoveon> or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13cuz at the end of the day, the essay plan only needs to make sense to the person using it, not necessarily to anyone else o.o
<Soital> 12back in my day homework was never done
<Angel_Espeon> 13but she marks you down if she thinks it doesn't make sense
<Soital> 12darn kidz and their homeworks

<Angel_Espeon> 13and I don't even make essay plans to begin with xD

<drf|laptop> 03he shares my passion for science
<nickstr> guess I need to drop the input level to the transmitter even with some aggressive bass clipping its still sounding distorted
<drf|laptop> 03so we'll have some serious discussions about scientific stuff
<drf|laptop> 03and then random MLP comment and I'm ,like "..."

<drf|laptop> 03Kinda defeating the purpose/
<drf|laptop> 03>?
<Kosoveon> honestly it's really hard to make me cry
<Light_Latias> 12because she bonded with the person
<Kosoveon> with movies

<drf|laptop> 03but the soundtrack
<drf|laptop> 03was really lacking
<drf|laptop> 03it could have been a lot better XZD
<drf|laptop> 03*XD
<Kosoveon> the only things I know about the soundtrack before seeing the movie
<Aeroslash> I heard that T Swift HG song
<Kosoveon> is that taylor swift

<Kosoveon> there are much less atoms in the universe than googolplex
<Aeroslash> it's like setting me the task to write out Pi
<junh1024-XD> no
<drf|laptop> 03I write out pi all the time, just round to 3.14 and call it good :P
<junh1024-XD> because pi length is infinite
<junh1024-XD> googleplex is finite
<drf|laptop> 03here's what you do
<Aeroslash> oh shush
<drf|laptop> 03you fill one page with 0's

<Lighty|ITTl> i knew that android and google just do ripoffs
*Lighty|ITTl flee
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> that's not Android's fault, it's the store that sent me that newsletter :P
<Viri> 14drf :D
<drf|work> LOl hi
<drf|work> oh, Viri, I can now get basically every version of Windows if you needed a specific one for upgrading XD
<Viri> 14o.o
<Viri> 14luv u
<Viri> 14I'm still backupping stuff :(
<drf|work> you have Vista Home Premium?
<drf|work> um
<Viri> 14yeah, but I'm going to format anyway
<drf|work> if you upgrade you don't need to back stuff up
<drf|work> :P
<Viri> 14since it's in italian xD
<drf|work> smart :P
<Viri> 14I can't upgrade if the OS got a different language :(
<drf|work> ah, makes sense
<drf|work> clean installs are better anyway
<drf|work> Ubisoft has surprised everyone by acknowledging restrictive and cumbersome DRM, the one that the company has used time and time again, is not the way forward when it comes to IP protection for games.
<drf|work> trolololol
<Viri> 14lol
<Viri> 14ubisoft games are blarg anyway xD
<Viri> 14except Rayman

<Lighty|ITTl> well,i am good at anything with Maths, but this is new
<drf|work> Excel is cool
<drf|work> I just hate using it for math LOL
<drf|work> but for actual data? Sure :P
<Chimera> Hi espyschool
<Lighty|ITTl> waddaya mean, Data
<Espeon|School> ~
<Lighty|ITTl> Maths is easy :P
<drf|work> I mean data like, numbers?
<drf|work> the actual point of spreadsheets :P
<Lighty|ITTl> hhmhh
<drf|work> rather than just using Excel to add stuff
<Lighty|ITTl> in need to copy one layer from a .psd file into a different .psd file in PhotoshopCS4
<Lighty|ITTl> harder then it looks...
<drf|work> EW ADOBE
<Lighty|ITTl> whut?
<drf|work> you heard me.
<Lighty|ITTl> any reason?
<drf|work> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/products/What-is-Windows-7-N-edition <- LOL What
<drf|work> somehow I thought the UK had a version of Windows 7 without IE, not WMP o.o
<drf|work> also because Adobe programs are stupidly bloated
<Lighty|ITTl> dont rage on me,but whats bloated?
<drf|work> using a lot more CPU/memory than usual
<Lighty|ITTl> so?
<Lighty|ITTl> when ya got enought RAM, who cares? xD
<drf|work> eh, that's not the point
<drf|work> that's like saying "I can afford gas, so who cares if I have a car that gets really crappy fuel mileage?"
<Lighty|ITTl> in my case,
<Lighty|ITTl> wait nvm
<drf|work> I have 24GB of RAM, sure I can run Adobe programs fine but what if I need to do other stuff?
<Lighty|ITTl> people think ill brag again .-.
<drf|work> it just limits you regardless because the programs are bloated
<drf|work> :P
<Lighty|ITTl> good thing im a no limits person :P
<drf|work> ow
<drf|work> my throat just started hurting
<Lighty|ITTl> get something like a Strepsil, or that kind of candy that betters throats
<drf|work> I'm at work, I can't just "get" anything
<Lighty|ITTl> what kind of work do you do then?

<Viri> 14xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13they were 50x50 squares of a translucent colour, not really worth backing up LOL
<Viri> 14I think I'll leave my profile normal
<Viri> 14it's not like people make queues to visit it xD

<drf|work> Windows 7 Starter is the crappiest version, literally removes like half the features including personalization

<ScriptBot> Snorlax uses Psycho Boost on Xanbreon! It's a critical hit! Xanbreon has 7 HP left!
<Xanbreon> All mine
<Xanbreon> Nop
<drf|work> so Xanbreon, someone suggested this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103249 <- but you'd still need a BIOS update for AM2+?
<Xanbreon> Sugested it for what?
<Xanbreon> The AM2 computer?
<drf|work> yeah
<Xanbreon> I wouldnt go above the 6000 AM2 stuff
<drf|work> 6000?
<Xanbreon> We went though this last time
<Xanbreon> I would stick to Ahtlon 64 chips unless you know it got an update to support K10 chips
<drf|work> w/e
<drf|work> I'm currently trying to figure out why the frick my phone won't send texts
<drf|work> I didn't disable anything related to texts
<drf|work> like it just sits there spinning the stupid progress thing and the messages never actually go through
<HyperMetalLugia> You broke your droid
<HyperMetalLugia> again
<Xanbreon> First thing to check is if your carrier is having issues
<Xanbreon> Did you remove STK?
<drf|work> STK?
<Xanbreon> Sim tool kit
<drf|work> um
<drf|work> no
<drf|work> I just used autostarts to disable most of the bloatware
<Xanbreon> Might not exist on CDMA phones
<drf|work> but that shouldn't affect *sending* texts
<drf|work> and even then, everything is enabled on SMS receive except Remote Web Desktop o.o
<Xanbreon> Thats on receiving not sending
<drf|work> I just said that
<drf|work> see, I just sent a test message to my email
<drf|work> nothing happened
<drf|work> and where it usualyl turns into a "message sent" symbol, it's just spinning OSX_style
<Xanbreon> Reboot
<drf|work> I already did
<drf|work> I'm not that daft LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> ANDROID IS A STOLEN PRODUCT! :D
<Xanbreon> No comment
<Viri|Mobile> O. O omg
<Xanbreon> Checked your provider?
<Viri|Mobile> win 7 is very fast
<drf|work> no, but I'm sure it's not a Verizon problem
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes it is.
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drf|work> maybe take the simcard out and put it back in?
<Xanbreon> Sure, why not
<Viri|Mobile> installing drivers
<drf|work> power off first? :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Durr
<Xanbreon> Generally a good idea
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Viri|Mobile> lol
<SilverSonic> wtf seriously...someone on the HoR server is claming that im impersonating them.
<Viri|Mobile> the logon screen pops up before the sound finishes
<Viri|Mobile> xD awesome
<SilverSonic> with THIS nick...
<drf|work> let's see what happens if I start it up with no SIM card
<drf|work> so Xanbreon is it actually possible to "clone" a SIM card like they do in spy movies? LOL
<Xanbreon> Yes
<Xanbreon> You can also clone phones via the IMEI
<drf|work> what's that, is that like the MEID number?
<drf|work> yeah I notice the Droid 4 calls it IMEA
<drf|work> *IMEI
<Xanbreon> Basically the phones serial number
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> the older phones I have
<drf|work> have ESN and MEID Hex
<Xanbreon> ESN is the CDMA/early FCC version of the IMEI
<drf|work> so you can clone ESNs?
<Xanbreon> and MEID is the replacment of ESN as they ran out of ESn numbers
<Xanbreon> Probs
<drf|work> LOL it just whines about not having a SIM card
<drf|work> right, I'll insert it again
<drf|work> a bit of a pain with this phone as it's not meant to be removed
<drf|work> and rebooting with the SIM card back in
<HyperMetalLugia> Force all the covers off!
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drf|work> OK so the voice works, I just called someone
<drf|work> let's try text again...
<drf|work> yeah nope it's not going :/
<drf|work> anyway I'm going home
<drf|work> I'll deal with this later x.x
<Xanbreon> derp

<drf|laptop> 03I got one for $17 even
<drf|laptop> 03but that old computer of mine uses DDR2, I was looking up prices, 4GB costs like $60

<drf|laptop> 03o_O
<drf|laptop> 03<SilverSonic> RAM 3.00 GB DDR3 @ 532MHz (7-7-7-20) <- Ok then yeah
<drf|laptop> 03you can get 2 4GB sticks for $30 total
<drf|laptop> 03but it all comes down to what the motherboard supports, it might be 2 max
<drf|laptop> 03as in 2 per slot
<SilverSonic> ah
<drf|laptop> 03that's even cheaper XD
<drf|laptop> 03well, sorta
<drf|laptop> 03as in, 2 2GBs is like $30
<drf|laptop> 03*20
<SilverSonic> where do you get RAM?
<drf|laptop> 03so obviously 8GB for $30 is a better value

<drf|laptop> 03orange and red are similar enough
<drf|laptop> 03we're boys, we aren't supposed to see colors well
*drf|laptop runs
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<drf|laptop> 03no but anyway
<drf|laptop> 03you know what's weird?
<drf|laptop> 03It includes a crap-ton of bonus content, and after the OS is installed it starts flashing a commandline and tells you not to remove the disc LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> here
<HyperMetalLugia> http://img87.exs.cx/img87/1228/dutchdellmce1bg.jpg
<HyperMetalLugia> THIS
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03mine includes media rollup 2
<HyperMetalLugia> in english n' all
<HyperMetalLugia> same
<HyperMetalLugia> but MCE is cool, right?
<HyperMetalLugia> what other extras are there? xD
<drf|laptop> 03it's decent
<drf|laptop> 03I mean I'm just running it in a VM
<drf|laptop> 03uh
<drf|laptop> 03it's a *DVD*
<drf|laptop> 03It has like 2GB of extras
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03mostly videos and crap
<drf|laptop> 03but oddly enough
<drf|laptop> 03they're DRM-protected videos, but yet the system was never individualized for DRM o.o
<drf|laptop> 03it's magic®
<HyperMetalLugia> is that a good thing(tm)
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03not really, as I can't use it to decrypt stuff :/
<drf|laptop> 03though I do get legit MCE keys through TechNet if you need ISOs/serials XD
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.ebay.com/itm/190654746553?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649
<drf|laptop> 03exact item I bought
<HyperMetalLugia> okay
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> same disks as I got
<HyperMetalLugia> I have my old soundblaster disk too xD
<drf|laptop> 03except it's orange and has media rullup 2 :P
<drf|laptop> 03*rollup
<drf|laptop> 03so uh, there's only two service packs for MCE?
<HyperMetalLugia> nono
<HyperMetalLugia> My XPS/MCEXP is on SP3
<HyperMetalLugia> I had to update it to SP3 though
<HyperMetalLugia> hrm
<drf|laptop> 03well yeah
<drf|laptop> 03supposedly media rollup 2 is the newest version of MCE hence why I asked
<HyperMetalLugia> Newest OEM
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Disk version but yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> newest you can get from Dell :v
<drf|laptop> 03newest version they made
<drf|laptop> 03as in
<drf|laptop> 03they never bundled it with SP3
<drf|laptop> 03unlike regular XP
<drf|laptop> 03but that's because MCE kinda died
<HyperMetalLugia> What a shame
<HyperMetalLugia> MCE is fun
<drf|laptop> 03http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/video-game-memes-but-i-loved-the-red-light.jpg
<drf|laptop> 03What DOES that button do?M
<drf|laptop> 03-M
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<HyperMetalLugia> I know
<HyperMetalLugia> for PS1, switches between the dpad and sticks
<HyperMetalLugia> my logitech controller has it too
<drf|laptop> 03the games couldn't just use both?
<HyperMetalLugia> Ape Escape (PS1) used pretty much both sticks and the dpad, from what I've seen
<HyperMetalLugia> Most older PS1 games didn't have or use the stick
<HyperMetalLugia> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/PS_Controller.jpg < original PS1 xD
<HyperMetalLugia> sucked really badly
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03as in, SNES ripoff
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<HyperMetalLugia> ahem
<HyperMetalLugia> SNES CD much?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drf|laptop> 03SNES CD?
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/media/27664/4/2.jpg < Whatever was made/suppose to fill this hole *giggle*
<HyperMetalLugia> Think Sega CD, but Sony+Nintendo
<HyperMetalLugia> they pretty much exchanged ideas for the SNES' addons
<HyperMetalLugia> Nothing ever happened though
<drf|laptop> 03Nintendo used Splash! But nothing happened!
<drf|laptop> 03trololol HML
<drf|laptop> 03guess what the name of the seller is
<drf|laptop> 03that sold me that MCE disc
<HyperMetalLugia> MCP?
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drf|laptop> 03HyperFocusPro
<drf|laptop> 03same first word :P
<HyperMetalLugia> :O
<HyperMetalLugia> nice
<drf|laptop> 03I always LOL when people sell OEM discs and then eBay removes them *after I buy them*
<drf|laptop> 03since you aren't allowed to sell OEM software without hardware
<drf|laptop> 03it's retarded LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> so like, I upgraded my laptop's 2GB SD card to a class 6 4GB card that was only 20$ here ;-;
<HyperMetalLugia> big improvement </semi-sarcasm>
<drf|laptop> 03see, this pisses me off
<drf|laptop> 03The version of Windows you are running is no longer available for purchase.
<drf|laptop> 03Check to see if your PC can run Windows 7.
<drf|laptop> 03What if it can't?
<drf|laptop> 03then you have to resort to piracy :P
<drf|laptop> 03which is what I'm gonna do
<HyperMetalLugia> Pirate ...what?
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<drf|laptop> 03because it's whining that I haven't activated it
<drf|laptop> 03activation.
<drf|laptop> 03it's a dell disc
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<drf|laptop> 03and it doesn't like VMs
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<drf|laptop> 03luckily I have an XP activation crakc
<drf|laptop> 03*crack
<HyperMetalLugia> well hurr I do have my XPS PC that has the silly serial on it
<HyperMetalLugia> could use that for my VM if I ever make one
<HyperMetalLugia> WB SS
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<HyperMetalLugia> !pokemon
<drf|laptop> 03it won't activate though HML
<ScriptBot> HyperMetalLugia, you are a 12Roselia.
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay
<HyperMetalLugia> PIRATE ALL THE PS2 games
<HyperMetalLugia> I remember the first PS2 game I pirated...kinda
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<drf|laptop> 03Yay pirating PS2 games
<HyperMetalLugia> Well
<HyperMetalLugia> There was no point as
<HyperMetalLugia> > No hacked PS2
<HyperMetalLugia> > No DVDs
<HyperMetalLugia> but you see
<HyperMetalLugia> I needed to test out the horribad PCSX2 to play Sonic Heroes
<drf|laptop> 03installing SP3 on this MCE
<HyperMetalLugia> the game was 3-4GB and took 1 week to torrent.
<HyperMetalLugia> that was like 3 years ago
<SilverSonic> drf: i have 2 slots for Ram, if i take the old ram out can i put new ram in place of it. o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> yes you can
<HyperMetalLugia> UNLESS IT is Super RAM
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<drf|laptop> 03t0hat's the whole point
<drf|laptop> 03but the question is, what's the max that each slot supports?
<drf|laptop> 03if it's 2GB, you're already maxed out on one
<SilverSonic> i have 3GB of Ram but only 2.6 is available. i think
<HyperMetalLugia> 32bit
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03onboard graphi*cs
<HyperMetalLugia> not a big dreal lols

<drf|laptop> 03If LL can do it, so can you :P
<SilverSonic> i doubt that.
<HyperMetalLugia> LL had love from you
<HyperMetalLugia> SS won't
<HyperMetalLugia> ;>
<SilverSonic> that i can build it i mean.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
<drf|laptop> 03that doesn't help build computres
<drf|laptop> 03*computers
<SilverSonic> well i dont even have much money for parts.
<SilverSonic> which is why i wish i asked for that desktop that you were on about sending long ago x.x
<SilverSonic> but then again
<SilverSonic> someone beat me to that anyway
<drf|laptop> 03wait, what?

<drf|laptop> 03and business computers are awesome
<drf|laptop> 03you can put up to 8GB of RAM in there
<drf|laptop> 03problem is it's DDR2 so the RAM is expensive :/
<SilverSonic> >HP
<HyperMetalLugia> Anti-DDR2 propaganda time
<SilverSonic> >Spyware

<drf|laptop> 03a
<Xanbreon> The hell is directCD?
<drf|laptop> 03some retarded proprietary crap
<drf|laptop> 03where you could lioke
<drf|laptop> 03*like
<drf|laptop> 03write a single CD-R more than once
<drf|laptop> 03it was multisession crap
<drf|laptop> 03required special software to read/write
<drf|laptop> 03actually
<Xanbreon> Ooohh
<drf|laptop> 03XP had it built in for writing
<drf|laptop> 03it asked you
<drf|laptop> 03if you wanted to do DirectCD or normal
<drf|laptop> 03at least on my Dell, that coulda been their crap, dunni

<Xanbreon> Life sucked before flash
<Xanbreon> Burning CD's of junk
<Xanbreon> Losing CD's
<Xanbreon> Burning more

<drf|laptop> 03something about line 1747
<Xanbreon> Finding it, but its scratched now, and the lable rubbed of, so frack it, it can become a cup coster
<Xanbreon> Maybe the file you made is b0rked
<Xanbreon> Or the drive is b0rked
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I took the disk we had at work
<drf|laptop> 03which works, I used it first-hand
<drf|laptop> 03and used winimage to make a .ima
<drf|laptop> 03it didn't report any errors
<drf|laptop> 03so I dunno
<NightSeas> 12External Hard Drives or GTFO
<Xanbreon> Cant you use a CD for winXP drivers?
<Xanbreon> OR was it only floppys?

<Xanbreon> Wow
<drf|laptop> 03I suppose I can try to slipstream it
<Xanbreon> Its been a longg time since I installed XP on anything
<NightSeas> 12Blu-rays are awesome too
<drf|laptop> 03but slipstreatming tends to screw stuff up
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03it's an old computer
<drf|laptop> 03what else would I put on it
<Xanbreon> Im full of "meh" about blueray
<drf|laptop> 03I tried 7, it had a performance index of like 2.5 LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> DOS?
<Xanbreon> Performance index is crap
<drf|laptop> 03I finally replaced those faulty video cards
<drf|laptop> 03with some cheapie 5500s or something
<drf|laptop> 03nvidia ones
<drf|laptop> 03as it had to be AGP >_>
<Xanbreon> Random 5200rpm laptop drives scores the same as my velociraptor did
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Xanbreon> And the velociraptor was a lot faster, and had far lower seek times
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe it is secretly fast.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<drf|laptop> 03>Seagate
<drf|laptop> 03I'm going to just toss that out there
<Xanbreon> velociraptor is WD
<Xanbreon> you derp
<drf|laptop> 03now, one thing I will agree on in terms of broken-ness
<drf|laptop> 03is that it says memory SPEED, but it really looks at memory AMOUNT too
<Xanbreon> 10k RPM SATA drives
<drf|laptop> 03as I just added more RAM sticks and the score iwent up
<drf|laptop> 03*went
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03I was thinking barracuda then I guess
<Xanbreon> Probs
<Xanbreon> Performance index is just for noobs, srsly, its totally meaningless
<drf|laptop> 03well sigh, wtf do I do about this computer
<Xanbreon> :/
<drf|laptop> 03it's this old IBM one
<drf|laptop> 03with SCSI hard drive
<drf|laptop> 03the stock XP disc won't find it
<Xanbreon> Didnt you want to dump the SCSI controller?
<drf|laptop> 03but at least it doesn't bluescreen like it does with AHCI
<drf|laptop> 03it just says "no disk found"
<drf|laptop> 03I did
<drf|laptop> 03but I don't have any IDEs right now
<Xanbreon> Aahh
<drf|laptop> 03and I mainly wanna make sure the graphics cards work
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<drf|laptop> 03I could do win7 but it's a royal pain since no DVD drive
<Xanbreon> Slipstream
<drf|laptop> 03and it won't boot from USB
<drf|laptop> 03it's fricking retarxded
<drf|laptop> 03-x
<Xanbreon> Old thus no USB boot support
<Xanbreon> d3rp
<drf|laptop> 03well
<HyperMetalLugia> turn the old PCs into bitcoin miners ;
<HyperMetalLugia> l3
<HyperMetalLugia> ;3
<drf|laptop> 03it supports USB DVD drives
<drf|laptop> 03just not flash drives o_O
<drf|laptop> 03which is how I got 7 on there LOL
<drf|laptop> 03but it was reading slow as frick
<drf|laptop> 03took over an hour to install
<drf|laptop> 03anyway um
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<Xanbreon> Yeh, you would spend more keeping the things on than you would earn farming on those PoS's
<drf|laptop> 03XD you would
<Xanbreon> You want highend AMD cards for bitcoin farming
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03I wasted so much fricking money on those
<drf|laptop> 03I'm ;a bit pissed still
<Xanbreon> Well.. 6800's?
<drf|laptop> 03because bitcoins are a waste
<Xanbreon> Or meh
<drf|laptop> 03uh
<drf|laptop> 035200 ors omething
<drf|laptop> 03some AGP cards
<Xanbreon> I know what a 5200 is
<Xanbreon> Everyones had a FX5200 in there lives
<Xanbreon> I was talking about for farming
<Xanbreon> Srsly, everyone I know has had FX5200
<Xanbreon> Probs cos they where dirt cheap
<drf|laptop> 03yieah
<drf|laptop> 03-i
<drf|laptop> 03that's why I got them
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Xanbreon> And could almost maybe do some 3D if you asked them nicely
<drf|laptop> 03anyway brb I'll just grab the CD and dump it on here and try to slipstream the f'ing thing
<Xanbreon> And prayed to the gods of GPUs
<Xanbreon> gl&h
<Xanbreon> +f
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey
<Xanbreon> What?
<HyperMetalLugia> My HD 4350 plays Portal fine
<Xanbreon> FX5200, nvidia card
<HyperMetalLugia> At near HD resolution xD
<Xanbreon> This is from back when nvidia used 4 numbers in there model numbers
<Xanbreon> *from when nvidia had 4 numeral model numbers
<HyperMetalLugia> So what about it?

<Xanbreon> sh1t is a crap thing to have censered
<Xanbreon> When crap isnt
<Xanbreon> ....
<drf|laptop> 03mine's a 5500, not 5200 actually

<HyperMetalLugia> lololol
<Suinide> Shit
<Xanbreon> Im just saying the weight given to some words over others, even when there is little distinction in there meaning or context they can be used in is stupid
<Kimori> I'm taking my last prereq class in college for the summer, supposed to be the toughest class
<Kimori> its going to suck :/
<drf|laptop> 03well it's like how "piss" isn't considered swearing at all where I live but to you Brits it is
<drf|laptop> 03it's just cultural stuff and around here that word is a lot worse than "crap"
<junh1024-XD> inb4 clbuttic
<NightSeas> 12Well, words like Crap and fricken are used as substitutes for those words
<Xanbreon> Piss is really not a swearword
<Xanbreon> Ill say "im going for a piss" anytime
<Xanbreon> :/
<Xanbreon> We just like to say piss off

<Xanbreon> http://www.bronyradio.com/ < dude on air is great, give it a listen, theres not much pony so ff
<Xanbreon> :3
<junh1024-XD> well, the tools for 22.2 mixing is baisically nonexistent outside NHK, iirc.
<HyperMetalLugia> how about
<junh1024-XD> heck, even over half of daws DON't support 5.1
<HyperMetalLugia> we mix stereo 12 times
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<drf|laptop> 03NHK?
<junh1024-XD> well, you could, but it's extremely hard to manually manage it .
<junh1024-XD> NHK is a broadcaster in japan.
<junh1024-XD> they developed the 22.2 standard in 2005
<drf|laptop> 03so Xanbreon, apparently the text message dillemma was Handcent SMS's fault
<Xanbreon> Urk
<SheenaFox> I'm so out of it
<drf|laptop> 03I deleted my texts and uninstalled handcent, sent a test message with the stock app and it worked fine
<Xanbreon> I dislike 3rd party sms apps
<Xanbreon> :/
<drf|laptop> 03but I hate the stock app
<drf|laptop> 03Handcent is awesome
<SheenaFox> I jumped when my parents opened the door to my room lolol
<Xanbreon> O-o
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
<drf|laptop> 03well Xanbreon
*junh1024-XD f2k marble - Suisai Candy (2chFLAC@1020kbps, 31.8mb/4:20)
<drf|laptop> 03keep in mind
<drf|laptop> 03this is America
<drf|laptop> 03they nerf everything
<drf|laptop> 03our stock messaging app sucks compraed to yours :/
<Xanbreon> Aahh..
<drf|laptop> 03*compared
<drf|laptop> 03so yeah
<Xanbreon> Im on ICS AOSP atm so yeh
<drf|laptop> 03Handcent lets me customize it
<drf|laptop> 03stock one doesn't
<Xanbreon> Well, CM9
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03There's a CM9 for my phone but it's buggy as frick so I'm not gonna bother yet XD
<Xanbreon> Theres a AOKP port for your phone you know
<drf|laptop> 03?
<drf|laptop> 03it's not CM9 eis it?
<drf|laptop> 03-e
<Xanbreon> Like CM9
<Xanbreon> Some bugs, go check XDA
<drf|laptop> 03like the wifi not working? >_>
<Xanbreon> wifi works
<Xanbreon> O-o
<drf|laptop> 03not on CM9
<Xanbreon> I think bluetooth is iffy though
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<drf|laptop> 03I actually use bluetooth
<Xanbreon> http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1502
<junh1024-XD> HyperMetalLugia let's suppose we want to manuall move a sound around you manually in 5.1 ok?
<junh1024-XD> you need to fade it in and out in the center channel, afterwards, fade it in and out for the right, fade it in and out for the right surround, etcetc
<junh1024-XD> tldr too tedious.
<Xanbreon> Looks like bluetooth audio doesnt work
<Xanbreon> But unno
<Xanbreon> Go have a look
<drf|laptop> 03meh
<drf|laptop> 03I'm fine with stock+ADW Launcher
<drf|laptop> 03btw
<drf|laptop> 03I wasted $3 on ADW Ex and didn't like it
<drf|laptop> 03for some reason
<drf|laptop> 03it actually removes some of the GUI stuff of the free one
<drf|laptop> 03like the desktop dots
<Xanbreon> You can change that
<Xanbreon> It has like 4 dot styles
<drf|laptop> 03I couldn't find an option
<Xanbreon> If you mean the indicators as to which homescreen you are on
<drf|laptop> 03and I searched for like 20 mins
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03there are also little dots at the bottom
<Xanbreon> Yeh.. you defo can
<drf|laptop> 03that you click on to switch homescreens
<drf|laptop> 03so you don't have to drag your fingers
<drf|laptop> 03I use that quite often
<Xanbreon> UI settings
<Xanbreon> Its called "Show desktop indicator"
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Xanbreon> And chose "Indicator type"
<drf|laptop> 03well I'm sticking to the free one for now
<drf|laptop> 03as that's what CM7 uses and I'm too used to it
<Xanbreon> EX is just the same but with more options :P
<drf|laptop> 03nope
<drf|laptop> 03they changed the look of the 3 icons at the bottom too0
<drf|laptop> 03-0
<drf|laptop> 03added some stupid drop shadow behind it
<Xanbreon> Ohnoes they changed the defaults?!
<drf|laptop> 03I couldn't find a way to change that back
<Xanbreon> How will you ever live with the ability to change it
<drf|laptop> 03I was playing with the settings
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<drf|laptop> 03brb
<Xanbreon> Thats like, in the theme settings
<Xanbreon> You can turn it off

<Ascendant> jesus christ mIRC lags
<Ascendant> compared to xchat it is horrible
<Ascendant> the interface is excellent, and I love that, as well as the scripting
<Ascendant> but why can't mIRC handle text?
*Skydroid shrugs
<HyperMetalLugia> It is only a problem when you have a bouncer
<Ascendant> you can decrease the buffer
<Ascendant> I'm used to xchat which loads the logs in about a second or less
<Ascendant> unlike mIRC, which takes nearly 5
<Ascendant> even CGI:IRC does it better
<Ascendant> my laptop's hdd failed so I'm using a gov laptop atm
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, they're kinda both basic :|
<Ascendant> which has a damn load of restrictions
<HyperMetalLugia> How did that happen? o.o
<Ascendant> can't use exes
<Ascendant> I dunno
<Ascendant> it's an old laptop
<HyperMetalLugia> oh, fail :|

<Yukari> oh so irc works now
<drf|work> yeah
<drf|work> Arti fixed the domains after I prodded her about it again
<drf|work> ...for now :/
<Yukari> wait so what happened
<drf|work> basically
<drf|work> she wants to move the site back to lugia.co.uk and ditch the .us name
<drf|work> or like, she'll have it redirect to .co.uk
<drf|work> but due to some stupid issue which I don't quite understand, she can't have both
<drf|work> it has to be one or the other
<drf|work> and apparently she did something wrong which broke both domains and made them both just point to godaddy LOL
<Yukari> that's....rather amusing
<drf|work> yeah, but it was a bit frustrating XD
<Yukari> yeah
<Yukari> so i'm assuming she's trying to figure out what broke
<drf|work> something like that
<drf|work> I asked if she can leave the IRC domains alone but who knows if that'll be possible :/
<Yukari> might as well just make the switch
<drf|work> it's a matter of subdomains though
<drf|work> she'd have to create ocean.lugia.co.uk and all that
<Yukari> hmm
<drf|work> and TOO MANY PERIODS LOL
<drf|work> inb4 that's what she said
<Yukari> ohgdufi forgot about that
<drf|work> forgot about what?
<Yukari> the sub domais
<drf|work> ah
<Yukari> uh, domaina
<Yukari> ...
<Yukari> you get it.

<Xanbreon> drf, do you want me to setup a pair of subdomains for the IRC servers on mine, as a fallback?
<drf|work> if you want
<drf|work> ...I forgot I made a subdomain

<Xanbreon> Well they are not really subdomains
<Xanbreon> Just having lugia.veyka.co.uk point to both servers
<Xanbreon> You have that pointing at island btw
<NightSeas> 12drf
<NightSeas> 12I thought I told you what Joomla is :/
<Xanbreon> Okies added island/ocean and lugia .veyka.co.uk
<Xanbreon> for derps
<drf|work> yeah it points to island :P
<drf|work> since I didn't know ocean's IP at the time
<Xanbreon> 178.32.56.242
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> Win7 Enterprise does have the language packs
<drf|work> I just tested it on a VM
<drf|work> wasted one of my 500 activations, oh noez :P
<drf|work> oddly enough
<drf|work> it doesn't ask for a serial on installation
<drf|work> and tries to find an activation server
<drf|work> obviously it fails
<NightSeas> 12Joomla is web software used to manage articles, templates, and other stuff on your website.
<drf|work> and you have to hit "change key" and then enter it
<NightSeas> 12Thus why it’s called openwork content management system
<NightSeas> 12lolwut
<NightSeas> 12*opensource*
*EccoCode had to work with Joomla in his software engineering class two semesters ago
<NightSeas> 12I've had to work with Joomla too
<drf|work> not really sure I get what exactly that does, though
<NightSeas> 12drf, everytime Arti writes an article on the main site of TST she needs joomla to do so without doing a bunch of PHP
<drf|work> I thought she did it all in PHP
<Xanbreon> Its just one of many CMS's
<drf|work> also NightSeas you know PHP/web design crap?
<drf|work> and god dang it
<drf|work> Handcent SMS had an update
<drf|work> now it looks like f***ing iPhone
<drf|work> and you can't change it *that* much :/
<NightSeas> 12instead you can just do HTML and it automatically converts everything to PHP
<drf|work> my biggest beef is that it now shows the person's phone number, not just their name
<drf|work> so I can't just screenshot texts anymore
<drf|work> I'd have to blur their number out >_>
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<NightSeas> 12and it's opensource so if you want to do PHP you can
<drf|work> hi
<drf|work> and NightSeas I'm trying to remake my linkmaker in something more modern, can you help? :P
<NightSeas> 12It also keeps everything organized kind of like a control panel on a computer
<drf|work> hm.
<drf|work> For your living convenience, our apartments include on-site laundry facilities, complimentary parking, utilities, local phone, RocketNET high-speed internet and DirecTV with HBO--we also have storage units available for rent!
<drf|work> I wonder if RocketNET is any good
<drf|work> but EW DIRECTV
<NightSeas> 12sure, I could try to help :p
<drf|work> at least it would beat the college's crappy analog cable :/
<drf|work> basically
<drf|work> what I want to do is make it so it'll have a form (text box like thing)
<drf|work> that says "Enter your URL"
<drf|work> you enter it and hit "Make link"
<drf|work> and it'll just have a hyperlink that says "click here"
<drf|work> that way you can right-click and save as
<drf|work> for when you get hotlinks to mp3s etc and the stupid browser plugins take over
<NightSeas> 12ah
<drf|work> make sense? :P
<drf|work> I had one that worked manually, e.g. you had to do linkmaker.cgi?Paste link here
<drf|work> but it doesn't work under Windows Server
<drf|work> so I'm thinking something more userfriendly where it'll actually prompt you with a box
<drf|work> but obviously plain old HTML itself won't be enough :/
<NightSeas> 12yeah XD
<HyperMetalLugia> :O
<HyperMetalLugia> hrm
<NightSeas> 12Well, right now my mom wants to take me shopping so I’ll have to help you in a few hours
<drf|work> yeah that's fine
<NightSeas> 12alright
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<drf|work> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7_editions#Comparison_chart <- ah you were right Xanbreon
<drf|work> Somehow I thought Win7 Enterprise was more like professional, not ultimate
<drf|work> but nice XD
<drf|work> maybe Vista Enterprise is the one that's more in-tune with Business and not ultimate?
<Xanbreon> Maybe
<Xanbreon> Havent checked in a while
<Xanbreon> But it probs is like bizz
<drf|work> my school used to have Vista enterprise
<Xanbreon> And vista's editions where not supersets like win7's
<drf|work> oddly enough, I think they switched to 7 Pro, not enterprise
<drf|work> same thing with this company
<drf|work> we're using pro, not enterprise
<drf|work> so apparently 7 enterprise is harder to get approved for? LOL
<Xanbreon> Probs only needed if you have 1000's of computers
<drf|work> prolly, maybe it costs that much
<drf|work> we only have about 50 computers here
<drf|work> and half are still on XP
<drf|work> yay Dell activation :P
<drf|work> but the university prolly did have over 1000 computers, between all their labs and all that
<drf|work> they were a bit daft, installing Vista on computers clearly marked as "designed for XP" and then wondering why people were whining about them taking 10 mins to boot >_>
<drf|work> I actually filed a complaint like "your IT department is morons for trying to upgrade old boxes"
<Sheena> I'm not at school again lol
<drf|work> hi Sheena
<drf|work> you aren't a fox anymore? :O
*Xanbreon shrugs
<Xanbreon> Maybe MS save them pro for free
<Xanbreon> They do that sometimes
<SheenaFox> Perhaps I am
<drf|work> well, there's a VLK version of pro
<drf|work> it's just strange that they would use that instead of enterprise
<drf|work> especially considering that they had Vista enterprise
<drf|work> LOL what, you can in-place upgrade any version of Vista to 7 Ultimate
<drf|work> that's useful actually
<drf|work> somehow I thought it had to be the same one
<Xanbreon> As ultimate is the top lvl it should go over anything
<drf|work> yeah
<drf|work> according to wikipedia it does
<drf|work> LOl you can turn off Windows search?
<Xanbreon> Of cause
<Xanbreon> Its just a service
<Xanbreon> Well.. more like you turn off the indexing
<drf|work> so that disables the searchbox?
<Xanbreon> Dont think so
<drf|work> no I mean in "enable/disable Windows features"
<Xanbreon> Yeh, pretty sure thats the indexing backen
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> would be lulzy if you could turn off the search box
<drf|work> owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww I just poked myself in the eye with a pen
*drf|work winces
<Xanbreon> Good jorb
<drf|work> hey, you got the instructions for editing the Windows 7 ISO to let you pick your version?
<Xanbreon> http://www.redmondpie.com/install-any-version-of-windows-7-with-universal-iso-9140092/
<drf|work> thanks
<drf|work> I noticed they're all teh same size so yeah
<drf|work> except enterprise
<drf|work> that one's a tad bigger
<Xanbreon> Enterprise is a diff ISO i think
<drf|work> ywah
<drf|work> *yeah
<drf|work> Holy crap dude
<drf|work> I just got a speedtest result of 28mbps on 4G LTE
<drf|work> That's amazing LOL
<drf|work> wait, Xanbreon, this thing wants me to select a patch file... I thought I REMOVE a file?
<Xanbreon> Did you download the right tool
<Xanbreon> As there is two
<Xanbreon> you want the ei.cfg removal utility
<drf|work> both links go to the same file
<Xanbreon> Not the edition switcher

<Xanbreon> drf, you have posted that twice
<drf|work> sorry, I forget
<Aurora> 6I DON'T KNOW
<Aurora> 6I just do XD
<junh1024-XD> because sh'es knowledgeable
<prince-dari> So about 6 of us at school have decided to pick back up the gameboy colours and play through red/blue/yellow.
<junh1024-XD> you don't get nice 1/2 consise summaries in wikis. they often have a lot of fluff and save the juicy bits for later.
<prince-dari> Going well so far. :P
<Ran> 02!pokemon

<Ran_Yakulol> 02I still don't know who that character is :D
<Aurora> 6that calculator be awesome
<Aurora> 6it looks photoshopped XD
<drf|work> it does, but there *is* a color TI calculator now
<drf|work> so it wouldn't surprise me
<drf|work> I had some Mario and very very primitive Pokémon ports on my 83+
<Aurora> 6I know
<Aurora> 6I was on about the angle of the image
<Aurora> 6but yeh
<prince-dari> Why did they think anyone would want a colour screen on their calculator?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ran Yakumo's one of my top favourite Touhou characters :'3
<prince-dari> O_o
*Aurora 6continues playing pokemon on her phone

<prince-dari> Lol
<drf|work> prince-dari, because next thing you know, those calculators will text and make phone calls too :D
<drf|work> and do facebook
<drf|work> and get 3G
<prince-dari> Lawl
<drf|work> and then they'll cease to exist and be known as smartphones
<drf|work> :D
<drf|work> I mean
<drf|work> uh, no diea
<drf|work> *idea
<Aurora> 6ran yakumo is the shikigami for yukari yakumo. Ran is a 9-tailed kitsune, is considered somewhat motherly to her own shikigami, chen, and gets stuck doing everything around the house as yukari sleeps most of the time
<Ran_Yakulol> 02Pretty :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Rawra did it again :D
*Angel_Espeon runs
<Aurora> 6I'm sorry OTL
<Angel_Espeon> 13DON'T APOLOGISE, IT'S SO GREAT
<junh1024-XD> you mean the yukari that is your co-favourite character?
<Aurora> 6yep
<Angel_Espeon> 13current top favourites are Chen, Koakuma, Sanae Kochiya, Ran Yakumo and Satori Komeji
<Angel_Espeon> 13in that order
<Angel_Espeon> 13most likely to change over time .w.
<drf|work> posting this one again for people who weren't here earlier

<prince-dari> Hah
<drf|work> I know right
<junh1024-XD> zo
<Aurora> 6my favorites (top I guess) in order: Yukari, Sakuya, marisa and Toyosatomimi (tied), Mokou and keine (tieeeed again)
<Aurora> 6oh and shinki is in there somewhere too, probably between toyosa and mokou
*Aurora 6slams head
<junh1024-XD> the only time yukari isn't sleeping is when she's changing touhouland borders and trolling?
<Aurora> 6pretty much
<Aurora> 6xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Rawra you floof, you should narrow that list down to five characters and five only :P
*Angel_Espeon runs
<junh1024-XD> my favourite is suika because she's cute.
<junh1024-XD> (one)
<junh1024-XD> there.

<Aurora> 6considering my list of favorites is technically like 24 characters long
<Aurora> 6also
<Aurora> 6Symposium of Post-Mysticism was delayed :<

<prince-dari> It still is March
<Aurora> 6we should be seeing trials for a new touhou game this coming month
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ooooh, I approve of this :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13<3
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6depends

<Aurora> 6like UNL, SWR, and fairy wars
<SilverSonic|Away> .............
<Aurora> 6hmm
<Aurora> 6unless he's gonna wait for reitaisai 9
<Aurora> 6which would make sense
<Angel_Espeon> 13Fairy Wars hurts my left hand when I play it
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I can't get used to the controls
<Aurora> 6which means we're waiting til late may.
<Angel_Espeon> 13asdfghj

*drf|work runs

<SilverSonic> sigh
<Aurora> 6EoSD for me
<Angel_Espeon> 13partially cuz it's currently the only one I can beat on hard mode, hooray for cherry borders making things easier :'D
<Aurora> 6EoSD and TD

<SilverSonic> i've never played Touhou
<Aurora> 6see if you like it or not
<SilverSonic> heard its fun ;p
<drf|work> I heard it's stupidly addicting
<drf|work> hence >not playing it
<SilverSonic> yet you played Angry Birds
*SilverSonic hides
<drf|work> how many times do I have to say this
<HyperMetalLugia> I heard it gives you grey hair
<drf|work> Angry Birds actually has an ending
<Ran_Yakulol> 02I'm totally up for giving it a try, I just don't know where to start lol
<drf|work> and not 27 different games
<Angel_Espeon> 13Touhou isn't for everyone, but yeah you should try it :P
*Ran_Yakulol already has grey hair lol
<HyperMetalLugia> maybe 7
<drf|work> o_O really?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I originally didn't think I'd like it at all when I saw gameplay
<Angel_Espeon> 13then I tried
<SilverSonic> SIGH
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I was like "ohay this is fun"
<SilverSonic> where's espeon
<SilverSonic> need him for a sec.

<SilverSonic> Need his assistance elsewhere.

<Angel_Espeon> 13Am I not a good enough Espeon for you? D:
<drf|work> about it being stupidly addictive

<Espeon> lol wut
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
<Xanbreon> Hes an idiot
<NightSeas> 12foreveralone.jpg
<Xanbreon> And far to easy to troll
<Xanbreon> ^__^
<drf|laptop> 03LMAO
<drf|laptop> 03I'm now a member of the alumni association
<drf|laptop> 03of the college I dropped out of
<drf|laptop> 03that's fairly humerous
*Xanbreon claps
<drf|laptop> 03well
<NightSeas> 12I've trolled him with out trying to troll him before :(
<drf|laptop> 03I just didn't tell them I was leaving
<drf|laptop> 03I just left
<drf|laptop> 03so my name is still in their system
<drf|laptop> 03and I still have their .edu email
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Xanbreon> Ooops
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<drf|laptop> 03I haven't actually taken classes or paid tuition there in over a year
<drf|laptop> 03it's just like, they don't actually look that up
<Xanbreon> He doesnt need direct trolling
<Xanbreon> Just soft prodding
<drf|laptop> 03because yay hvaing like 30k students
<Xanbreon> Then he boils himself over
<Xanbreon> :D
<drf|laptop> 03so maybe if they go purging the database someday they'll be like "wait, what"
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Xanbreon> SilverSonic|Afk, SliverSanic SliverSonic helped as well
<NightSeas> 12I think he doesn't get jokes
<Xanbreon> They are funny trolls
<drf|laptop> 03well actually I don't know
<drf|laptop> 03I told them I was going to "take classes elsewhere for a while"
<drf|laptop> 03I wonder when they'll start wondering
<NightSeas> 12which is a shame :<
<drf|laptop> 03supposedly we hvae to surrender our student ID cards upon leaving the school
<Xanbreon> Meh :P
<drf|laptop> 03if they bug me
<drf|laptop> 03I'll be like
<drf|laptop> 03"I lost it"
<Xanbreon> Hes a fucking idiot
<drf|laptop> 03so what? i'll buy a new one for w/e fee
<drf|laptop> 03because then I can still use that one to get into football games LOL
<Xanbreon> Good jorb
<Espeon> <Xanbreon> They are funny trolls <- I personally disagree but I guess my standards are rather odd. Trolling must be rather exceptional for me to find it anything but severely stupid :p
*Espeon roll roll
<drf|laptop> 03not that I give a crap about football, but my sister is in the marching band so we go to a couple games each year
<drf|laptop> 03and yay student passes :P
<Xanbreon> My opinion may be coloured by my dislike of the target
<Xanbreon> ;)
<Xanbreon> And also the effectiveness against said target
<Espeon> As long as it's purple
<Xanbreon> p-p-p-purrpleee
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<drf|laptop> 03Xanbreon, ever ran into a problem with DBAN where it'll give a crap ton of "unable to read sector" errors and then just not boot? It's not the disc, I burned it a few times and it reads fine in ImgBurn
<drf|laptop> 03but it just won't boot on a couple machines i have
<NightSeas> 12[15:42] * SilverSonic (Silver@hooh12-51F92A90.dsl.airstreamcomm.net) Quit (Quit: ) SilverSonic|Afk is lightning@hooh12-35FB328A.ho-ohrealm.net * Lightning Farron
<drf|laptop> 03I had to make it into a flash drive version but the problem is I don't want to nuke my flash drive and/or tie it up for a few hours while it's going
*NightSeas wonders
<Xanbreon> drf, never used DBAN tbh
<Xanbreon> Might be the drive if its more than one disc
<drf|laptop> 03you got another tool for erasing hard drives?
<drf|laptop> 03did it on two drives too
<drf|laptop> 03as in
<drf|laptop> 03I replaced the DVD-ROm drive with a DVD+RW drive
<drf|laptop> 03and it still did it
<drf|laptop> 03I'd suspect the BIOS but it can boot Windows installation discs just fine so I dunno what else it would be
<Xanbreon> SilverSonic|Afk is on a hoho BNC
<NightSeas> 12oh
<Xanbreon> The first @hoho is part of the hostmasking
<NightSeas> 12k
<Xanbreon> Erm, I normally just use gparted
<Xanbreon> I dont see the need to wipe drives unless im getting rid of them
<Xanbreon> You are just adding uneeded wear and tear if you do a full wipe otherwise
<Xanbreon> I think the 2nd part is related to the IP address, and the last part is the rDNS on the IP
<Xanbreon> Or part of it
<drf|laptop> 03I *am* getting rid of them
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<drf|laptop> 03it's those crappy 40GB SCSI drives
<drf|laptop> 03that I want to toss
<drf|laptop> 03but they belonged to the company I work for, so I wanna make sure the data is actually gone
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<Xanbreon> Hit them with a hammer
<drf|laptop> 03and since they're SCSI I can't just toss them in anotherg machine
<drf|laptop> 03-g
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03That MIGHT work but LOL I'm paranoid and suc
<drf|laptop> 03*such
<drf|laptop> 03actually what might work
<drf|laptop> 03ONE of the two IBMs wwas able to boot DBAN
<drf|laptop> 03the other didn't
<drf|laptop> 03so tI could just swap the drives
<drf|laptop> 03I still don't quite understand why
<Xanbreon> Or plug them all into one
<drf|laptop> 03they're identical machines
<Xanbreon> Diff bios revision?
<drf|laptop> 03I dunno how SCSI works, that might take some tomfoolery in the bios
<drf|laptop> 03nope
<drf|laptop> 03I flashed them both
<Xanbreon> Cable bugs
<drf|laptop> 03at the same time
<drf|laptop> 03to the newest one
<drf|laptop> 03cable bugs?
<Xanbreon> Iffy cables
<drf|laptop> 03again, I can use Windows XP discs just fine
<Xanbreon> I dont know, computers do these things
<drf|laptop> 03and those computers are old and can't boot flash drives
<drf|laptop> 03so :"/
<drf|laptop> 03*:/
<drf|laptop> 03actually you know what I'll try
<drf|laptop> 03is xboot
<Xanbreon> SCSI should just be plug and pray
<drf|laptop> 03I use it to make flash drives
<drf|laptop> 03but it can make burnable ISOs too
<drf|laptop> 03and it uses GRUB bootloader to launch the crap
<drf|laptop> 03out of curiosity, is it possible to mount a hard drive doing ISO emulation but do it readonly so a nuke won't wipe it?
<drf|laptop> 03I was thinking of turning one of these old crap machines into a nuking station where I can just mount drives and wipe them
<drf|laptop> 03without needing to continually use the CD
<drf|laptop> 03I could always boot from an SD card and switch the lock on, trolol
<Xanbreon> Hurrhm
<drf|laptop> 03I know there's CF to IDE
<drf|laptop> 03does CF have locking though?
<Xanbreon> I dont know if DBAN will care about stuff mounted as readonly
<Xanbreon> If it goes after the physical devices
<drf|laptop> 03it searches for all drives
<junh1024-XD> 4: $50 nzd itunes card for $40 nzd
<drf|laptop> 03hence why if I use a flash drive, it wipes the flash drive LOL
<junh1024-XD> want?
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03not sure if there's anything useful in NZD store
<drf|laptop> 03well lemme try making an xboot ISO, that might do it
<SilverSonic> there we go.
<drf|laptop> 03One of these computers has flaky RAM, not sure if it's the stick or the motherboard, so I might just toss it :/
<drf|laptop> 03loud fans, broken GPU, honestly no point in fixing it up
<SilverSonic> actually one sec.
<drf|laptop> 03the other one works fine sans the GPU so I shoved a $30 5500 in there
<SilverSonic> mIRC is glitching x___x
<Xanbreon> Theres not much point fixing them up anyway tbh :P
<Xanbreon> Hurrhm
<drf|laptop> 03just to have?
<Xanbreon> I think SD card with hardware lock on is the best bet
<drf|laptop> 03enterprise computers are slightly lulzy
<drf|laptop> 03hm, k
<drf|laptop> 03CF doesn't have any sort of lock?
<drf|laptop> 03because CF -> IDE means less screwing around XD
<Xanbreon> Shame
<NightSeas> 12Asterisk, name yourself NlightSeas :D
<Asterisk> that's a regged nickname
<Asterisk> I'd rather not
<NightSeas> 12:<
<SilverSonic> even he isnt THAT stupid
<Xanbreon> Not as far as I know
<NightSeas> 12you're sure it's a he?
<Xanbreon> The lock is due to the S in SD
<Xanbreon> ;)
<SilverSonic> idk.
<drf|laptop> 03oh is it?
<junh1024-XD> well
<SilverSonic> and idc to be fair.

<drf|laptop> 03-y
<Xanbreon> Weird
<SilverSonic> the SilverSonic bit is ME though.
<drf|laptop> 03I have a 250GB SATA that was collecting dust
<drf|laptop> 03so why not?
<drf|laptop> 03free upgrade xD
<SilverSonic> i'd appreciate it if you changed or nick.
<Xanbreon> Are you the one and only SilverSonic in the whole world?
<SilverSonic> i really dont like it when people try to impersonate me.

<Xanbreon> Im pretty sure they are just trying to piss you off
<Xanbreon> And as you are getting pissed off, derp
<SilverSonic|Afk> i'd appreciate it if you fuck off
<SilverSonic|Afk> <3
<SilverSonic> sigh.
<Xanbreon> Kewl
<SilverSonic> why do i even bother with IRC anymore...
<Xanbreon> I dont know, why do you?
<drf|laptop> 03Haha this episode of Family Guy
<drf|laptop> 03I love this one
<SilverSonic|Afk> /quit SilverSonic|afk is pretending to be me i'm going to quit IRC over it
<Xanbreon> Horrid stickmissmatching on the ram
<Xanbreon> :(
<drf|laptop> 03well;
*SilverSonic slaps SilverSonic|Afk around a bit with a massive wrench
<drf|laptop> 03I had the 2GBs in my room
<drf|laptop> 03the 1GBs came iwth it
<drf|laptop> 03what else do I do
<drf|laptop> 036GB > 4
<drf|laptop> 03and it boots up fine so eh
<Xanbreon> The 2gig sticks are diff oems
<Xanbreon> ikki
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03LMAO
<drf|laptop> 03see
<drf|laptop> 03those were actually in my dad's computer
<drf|laptop> 03he bought a OEM computer
<drf|laptop> 03the motherboard died so I salvaged the RAM
<drf|laptop> 03Go blame THEM LOL
<Suinide> Boreeee
<Xanbreon> I will do!
<Xanbreon> Ohnoes the wrench of power!11!!oneone!111
<drf|laptop> 03I actually didn't look at the labels, I assumed they matched
<Xanbreon> OEMs do stupid things to
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03ironically it was a PowerSpec
<drf|laptop> 03PowerSpec is pretty legit
<Xanbreon> Never even heard of them
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<drf|laptop> 03it's Micro Center's OEM brand
<drf|laptop> 03they're a smallish store
<drf|laptop> 03that's *actually good* unlike Best Buy
<Xanbreon> Ah american bigbox store?
<drf|laptop> 03not really bigbox no
<drf|laptop> 03there's only like 30 of them nationwide
<Xanbreon> !Rukario
*Rukario now belongs to Xanbreon for 11 minutes
<Xanbreon> Aaahh
<Rukario> nooooo'
<Xanbreon> http://pandaboard.org/content/platform
<Xanbreon> I would love one of those
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.powerspec.com/
<drf|laptop> 03a few of their computers are literally the same price as buying the raw parts by themselves
<Xanbreon> Thats a horrid website
<drf|laptop> 03plus free support
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03it's a small business, what do you expect XD
<Xanbreon> Low/midrange pcs are generally not really worth building tbh
<drf|laptop> 03exactgly
<drf|laptop> 03-g
<drf|laptop> 03my mom's was like $400
<drf|laptop> 03from PowerSpec
<Xanbreon> As the build discount the oems gets counters out any buildityourself cheapness
<drf|laptop> 03and nowadays I could build her one about twice as good for the same price
<Rukario> just in time HyperMetalLugia
<Rukario> i'm doing linux homework
<drf|laptop> 03since hers only has a dual core Pentium and like 4GB of RAM
<drf|laptop> 03onbaord video
<drf|laptop> 03and we added a 9400GT
<Xanbreon> Generally building your own is only really needed for highend or if you have very spesific needs
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03my dad's PowerSpec was like $600 and has a core 2 quad
<Xanbreon> *specific
<drf|laptop> 03originally had DDR2 but when the board fried he got a new one and that used DDR3
<drf|laptop> 03so I had the RAM sticks as spares
<Xanbreon> A computer kinda like mine would have been £1500 ish
<Rukario> gah
<Xanbreon> I spent err
<Rukario> college why do you do this to me
<Rukario> stop sending me this stuff x-x
<Rukario> it does not make me feel safe
<Xanbreon> £1093
<Xanbreon> But the oem computer doesnt have a SSD, but it has a GTX580 vs a GTX570

<Xanbreon> And the problem is that I would have to have opened them up and buggered around to get the SSD ect in
<NightSeas> 12SilverSonic|Afk, why would you want someone thinking you where SS? It would just hurt your reputation.
*NightSeas hides
<HyperMetalLugia> nahahaaa
<SilverSonic> ...

<SilverSonic> that isnt helping.
<Xanbreon> NightSeas has a point
<SilverSonic> also fail use of were.
<drf|laptop> 03so Xanbreon, you know the options that show up when you hold Power on the phone? Is that part of the framework or can you add stuff?
<Xanbreon> drf, its called the power menu, its part of the framework
<NightSeas> 12lmfao
<drf|laptop> 03darn it
<drf|laptop> 03so I can't add an entry?
<Xanbreon> There are Advanced power menu mods
<drf|laptop> 03hmm
<Quilava> what's going on now?
<Xanbreon> But generally that means flashing a custom deodexed rom
<drf|laptop> 03requires root obviously?
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I ask because CyanogenMod has a "screenshot" option built into the power menu
<drf|laptop> 03I wanted to add something ismilar using any random screenshot progrma
<drf|laptop> 03*program
<SilverSonic> sigh you dont wanna know.
<NightSeas> 12SS is being awesome
<Xanbreon> SilverSonic|Afk best SilverSonic
<SilverSonic> oh fuck off TwatSeas.
<TwatSeas> 12:D
<Xanbreon> Thats a good one
<Xanbreon> No its not that easy
<Xanbreon> Hmm..
<Xanbreon> Normally it needs a deodexed rom
<drf|laptop> 03why, why do the oxexes screw it up?
<drf|laptop> 03*do
<Xanbreon> odex files are precompiled stuff for the dalvik VM
<NightSeas> 12http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/internet-memes-the-girl-who-does-nothing.jpg
<Xanbreon> If they dont match the file they are compiled from
<Iago> Alright, seriously, stop it you guys
<Xanbreon> Then everything breaks
<Xanbreon> Aka if you make modifications to the apk, you always need to edit its odex file
<Xanbreon> Its generally system apps that are odexed
<Xanbreon> and the framework
<Iago> While there are no rules, respect AND common sense is required

<nickstr> I never figured they would be saying this
*SilverSonic calms down a bit.
<Quilava> anyone want to play a game?
*TwatSeas heats up
<Xanbreon> Dundunduh
<nickstr> Adobe Flash is actually one of their positive points for Android
<nickstr> as is the open source nature
<NightSeas> 12Anyhow, you rally shouldn’t let such things bother you SS
<nickstr> like it or not Flash is still important in the web landscape today
<SilverSonic> i know
<NightSeas> 12really*
<SilverSonic> maybe you should try living a life of hell and see how you like it
<drf|laptop> 03so what do you suggest for taking screenshots easily?
<SilverSonic> get back to me when you do.
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03is there a way to like, make a hotkey
<drf|laptop> 03say power and volume?
<drf|laptop> 03similar to iPhones
<NightSeas> 12by no means is my life good LOL
*Xanbreon gets back to you
<Xanbreon> HAI
<nickstr> I recall seeing one in Android 3.2
<drf|laptop> 03I saw one program that will map itself to the camera button, but my phone doesn't have a camera button :/
<drf|laptop> 03just power and volume up/down
<Xanbreon> Find an app that can map itself to a button combo
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but it needs to take screenshots derp
<drf|laptop> 03and there's only a few I've even found
<Xanbreon> Or flash a custom rom
<SilverSonic> well im just really sick of being trolled at.
<drf|laptop> 03most of them require you to shake the phone or put some stupid overlay on top of everything
<Quilava> nobody wants to RTS a bit? :|
<SilverSonic> or being used for someone else's stupid games.
<Quilava> er
<Quilava> *TBS
<Quilava> fuck RTS I suck at that
<Xanbreon> Thats a shame, but your input lag is pretty bad
<drf|laptop> 03also can you find me a custom ROM for the Droid 4 that *actually works*? :P
<drf|laptop> 03since all the ones I've seen are experimental and buggy
<drf|laptop> 03so yeah
<Xanbreon> Go read up on XDA, they have stock based custom roms
<Xanbreon> Might even had a mod you want
<Xanbreon> Or even rootzwiki
<NightSeas> 12SS, someone can only be trolled if they let themselves be trolled
<drf|laptop> 03that site's a bit tl;dr though :/
<HyperMetalLugia> I want a android pokemon ROM
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<NightSeas> 12I just think it's funny when someone tries to troll me, you should do the same
<Xanbreon> Not really, just hit the dev section, spend a bit of time reading
<Xanbreon> You can break locked bootloaders phones pretty easy, thus you should spend some time reading about what your doing
*Xanbreon rolls NightSeas
<NightSeas> 12Because honestly, I don’t take very many people I meet online seriously.
<Quilava> ..so nobody wants to play a game with me?
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I have safestrap
<drf|laptop> 03hoewve rthat works
*NightSeas plays the hunger games with Quilava
<NightSeas> 12:D
<Xanbreon> Dunno what that is
<Quilava> :|
<SilverSonic> NightSeas: its hard for me to "laugh it off" when somene tries trolling me.
<drf|laptop> 03recovery thingy
<drf|laptop> 03that lets you dualboot
<SilverSonic> im not like others
<drf|laptop> 03the " safe" system won't be modified when the other one is messed with
<SilverSonic> im more sensitive when it comes to shit like that.
<Xanbreon> Ah cool
<drf|laptop> 03so you can put a custom ROM on the safe system and not worry about bricking
<drf|laptop> 03the only annoyhing thing
<NightSeas> 12but you don't even know these people that troll you?
<drf|laptop> 03is that ROM Mangaer doesn't know what it is
<drf|laptop> 03so I can't do scheduled backups
<drf|laptop> 03I have to do it manually :/
<Quilava> I'll take that as a no.
*Quilava idles
<Xanbreon> Yuck, sucky locked bootloaders
<Xanbreon> :/
<drf|laptop> 03Droid 2 had a locked bootloader too and they hacked the vcrap out of it
<drf|laptop> 03-v
<NightSeas> 12well, what game did you want to play?
<SilverSonic|Afk> [05:45:18 pm] (NightSeas) SilverSonic|Afk, why would you want someone thinking you where SS? It would just hurt your reputation.
<SilverSonic|Afk> fuck i lol'd
<Xanbreon> Yeh, motarolas gone a bit shovelware with the droids though
<drf|laptop> 03I know :/
<drf|laptop> 03it's good hardware, software is meh
<drf|laptop> 03I deleted all the bloatware and put AdwLauncher so it's mostly fine now
<Xanbreon> Most dev support is going towards the Razer
<Xanbreon> or w.e
<drf|laptop> 03for some reason
<drf|laptop> 03it worked when I just deleted Maps as a system app and reinstalled it from the market as a regular app
<drf|laptop> 03not sure why
<Xanbreon> Probs verizon borking junk
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Quilava> http://a23.catastrophex.com/play.html this
<drf|laptop> 03I flashed back to stock, only unisntalled the non-system bloatware (as in, didn't need root to do it), and it still broke
<drf|laptop> 03it must be Adw's fault
<drf|laptop> 03but LauncherPro crashed it too
<drf|laptop> 03and there's no way to use the stock without removing all custom launchers
<drf|laptop> 03so eh
<Xanbreon> Thats weird
<NightSeas> 12Unfortunately I’m not a member of catastrophex and lazy :<
<drf|laptop> 03it is
<Xanbreon> Probs motarollas crap software
<drf|laptop> 03prolly
<Quilava> too lazy to play the game, I suppose
<drf|laptop> 03but I got it working now, no worries
<drf|laptop> 03I just reinstalled it as a regular non-system app
<NightSeas> 12just too lazy to join
<Xanbreon> kewl
<Xanbreon> You can always just flash gaps
<drf|laptop> 03all you need is the market
<drf|laptop> 03literally all the rest are there
<NightSeas> 12might later though
<Quilava> so too lazy to play
<Iago> Rhyme, get off that nick ):
<SilverSonic|Afk> I AM AFRAID I CANNOT DO THIS
<Xanbreon> Mhhm, depends where in the world you are
<Xanbreon> Theres other stuff, libs for gtalk with video and stuff
<Xanbreon> That you dont get on some phones
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<NightSeas> 12how did SS end up with so many people doing that? Is it some kind of fad? XD
<SilverSonic|Afk> it's just to annoy him really
<Quilava> probably because they know it bugs him
<Xanbreon> http://wiki.rootzwiki.com/Gapps#Gingerbread_.28Android_2.3.x.29

<drf|laptop> 03so it's not a big deal
<Xanbreon> Yeh
<NightSeas> 12SS, if someone really wanted that name, say with some numbers after it then would it be okay? derp
<drf|laptop> 03so yeah any idea about the screenshot thing?
<drf|laptop> 03as for the Razr, Droid 4 is basically the same thing but with a keyboard so some of those ROMs might work
<Xanbreon> Dont think so

<Xanbreon> Tons of programs
<drf|laptop> 03oh wait
<drf|laptop> 03woah
<drf|laptop> 03Diskinternals XD
<drf|laptop> 03I have their Uneraser program
<Xanbreon> *nix based, windows based
<Xanbreon> blah blah
<drf|laptop> 03but the one I usually use is called GetDataBack
<Ascendant> Ah
<drf|laptop> 03it's pretty nice
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> the thing is
<drf|laptop> 03but it only works on FAT and NTFS
<Ascendant> trying to live boot into linux via CD gives the same disk error
<Ascendant> windows gives a black screen
<Ascendant> USB just gets stuck loading the program/boot sector
<Xanbreon> You tried putting a distro on a USB stick?
<drf|laptop> 03have you tried Parted Magic?
<Xanbreon> and not hitting the HDD at all
<drf|laptop> 03but no, like I said, physiclaly take the hard drive out
<drf|laptop> 03and mount it externally
<Ascendant> it's the hard drive that IS the problem
<drf|laptop> 03I don't think you're getting what I'm saying
<drf|laptop> 03you have more than one computer, right?
<drf|laptop> 03Take the hard drive out of computer 1
<Ascendant> yeah
<drf|laptop> 03attach it to the working one
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<Ascendant> and do what?
<Rukario> finally
<Rukario> last linux project
<drf|laptop> 03and run data recovery
<Rukario> gah i hate this so much x-x
<Ascendant> drf, the laptop the HDD is in works 100% fine
<drf|laptop> 03unless you don't care about the data
<Ascendant> but the hard drive doesn't
<drf|laptop> 03so you don't want to recovery it?
<drf|laptop> 03-y
<Ascendant> i do want to
<Ascendant> I need my linux files
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Rukario> o-o'
<Xanbreon> You need a working computer in order to pull files
<Ascendant> I already have the windows one since I haven't modified it since a few weeks ago and I have a 2 week old backup
<drf|laptop> 03I don't think you can recover the files without a working OS, and I don't know of any Linux-based recoveries
<Ascendant> well
<Xanbreon> You also dont want to be running from the HDD when recovering
<drf|laptop> 03oh, you want to boot into a live distro and see if you can just mount it?
<Xanbreon> Thus pull it and connect to another computer
<Ascendant> I tried booting into a live distro
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03that's the best option, mounting it externally
<Ascendant> doesn't work
<junh1024-XD> inb4 put in fridge
<Ascendant> well
<Xanbreon> Live distros used the HDD as cache
<Ascendant> how would I do that?
<drf|laptop> 03with a cable? LOL
<Ascendant> I'd need a cable e.g SATA-USB or something
<Ascendant> I don't have any
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03go steal one
*drf|laptop hides
<Ascendant> :U
<Xanbreon> it wont be sata
<Xanbreon> It will be err
<Xanbreon> The laptop version of PATA
<Ascendant> firewire?
<Ascendant> ah
<drf|laptop> 03LMAO firewire
<Xanbreon> No
<drf|laptop> 03Xanbreon you know what I saw that made me LOL a bit?
<drf|laptop> 03USB monitors.
<Xanbreon> Smaller PATA(IDE)plug
<Ascendant> urgh
<drf|laptop> 03I kid you not
<Xanbreon> drf, they are a cool idea
<drf|laptop> 03no VGA required
<drf|laptop> 03USB only
<Ascendant> that's lovely
<drf|laptop> 03and they go up to 24"
<drf|laptop> 03that's fricking bizarre
<Ascendant> haha drf
<drf|laptop> 03"My video card doesn't have a USB port, help"
<Xanbreon> You wont get fast 3D out of them though
<Xanbreon> :P
<Ascendant> lmao
<drf|laptop> 03you can't powre them through teh GPU?
<Ascendant> well
<HyperMetalLugia> ahme
<drf|laptop> 03*power
<Xanbreon> No
<HyperMetalLugia> USB 3 GO!
<Ascendant> I'll see if I can get one
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Xanbreon> NS, check your laptop model
<Xanbreon> Find a guide about how to remove the HDD
<drf|laptop> 03LOL people bringing loaded guns into the pawn shop
<Xanbreon> As some.. yeh, are a HUGEE PAIN
<drf|laptop> 03mine's stupidly easy since it's custom built
<drf|laptop> 03you just take the two screws out and pop it out
<Xanbreon> Mhhm
<drf|laptop> 03inf act I have one with Windows and one with Mac OSX, I can just swap the two
<Xanbreon> depends on the device
<Ascendant> well taking the hard drive out is easy
<Ascendant> just need to be careful not to damage that random connector orange cord thing
<Ascendant> whatever you call that
<Ascendant> and then attach the hard drive elsewhere
<Xanbreon> IDE cable
<Ascendant> yeah that
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Xanbreon> You will probs want a external USB enclosure
<drf|laptop> 03first, is the idea just to see if you can copy the data off?
<Xanbreon> Though, tbh
<Xanbreon> Actually
<Ascendant> yeah drf
<Ascendant> I just want the data
<Xanbreon> If you have 1) a flash drive 2) a large external HDD (big enough to store all the data)
<drf|laptop> 03have you tried Parted magic?
<Ascendant> no need to salvage the stuff
<Ascendant> nope
<drf|laptop> 03try that
<Ascendant> I've tried Hirens though
<drf|laptop> 03it's about 150MB thogh
<drf|laptop> 03*though
<drf|laptop> 03the older ones are like 50
<Ascendant> heh well
<drf|laptop> 03but burn it to a CD
<drf|laptop> 03and try it out
<Ascendant> I'll see
<Ascendant> technically USB would be better
<Ascendant> but yeah
<Xanbreon> You could install a linux distro to the flash stick, then dump stuff to the external
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03get xboot
<drf|laptop> 03are you on Windows right now?
<drf|laptop> 03LMAO a hat made out of beaver

<Light_Latias> 12LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;3
<Xanbreon> I vote orgy
<Xanbreon> But thats just me
<Light_Latias> 12I vote cleanliness
*Light_Latias shoves soap in Xanbreons mouth
<Xanbreon> You dont get to play the pure card anymore
<Rukario> i vote free anger management classes for Xanbreon
<HyperMetalLugia> ooh
<HyperMetalLugia> I just noticed
<Xanbreon> I am very good at managing my anger
<drf|otherPC> Xanbreon
<drf|otherPC> didn't we have an orgy last night though?
<HyperMetalLugia> I have the Windows 7 areo spinner on my laptop
<Xanbreon> Fear me if i actually lose my temper
<SliverSanic> Sorry Ban, sup.
<HyperMetalLugia> not the vista...
<drf|otherPC> so it wouldnt' be as special
<drf|otherPC> X
<drf|otherPC> *XD
*HyperMetalLugia raegs
<SliverSanic> Didn't see it until a few seconds ago.
<Xanbreon> drf, if we did, I really fracking hope you wherent in it
<Xanbreon> :3
<drf|otherPC> uh, I was here
<Xanbreon> "oops i bummed drf"
<Xanbreon> :3
<drf|otherPC> LL, you, me, and Chimera mostly?
<drf|otherPC> :P
<Light_Latias> 12Xanbreon
<Ban> Hi
<Light_Latias> 12cleanliness!=purity
<Xanbreon> Light_Latias
<Light_Latias> 12and I blame both my sis and Danny for my loss of the latter
<drf|otherPC> for example, you can take a shower with acid rain
*drf|otherPC hides
<Xanbreon> semantics, but you dont get to play that card either
<Light_Latias> 12wow
<Light_Latias> 12I misread
<Light_Latias> 12badly
<Xanbreon> orly? :3
<drf|otherPC> why do all these Android screenshot apps have like a 2-3 second delay before the actual image is saved?
<drf|otherPC> is that just an Android problem?
<Xanbreon> CM9 ss capture is instant
<Rukario> gah
<drf|otherPC> wasn't for me
<Rukario> i hate this book so much
<Rukario> it's so far over my head
<drf|otherPC> neither was CM7
<drf|otherPC> it was still 2-3 seconds
<Xanbreon> Instant as in, basically 1s and most of that was animation
<drf|otherPC> I mean it was just a delay
<drf|otherPC> gave me time to open another app
<Xanbreon> It has to grab the visable stuff from each active window
<Xanbreon> As mobile GPUS improve stuff like this should work better
<drf|otherPC> so on a 1.2GHz dualcore why would that take more than half a second?
<drf|otherPC> I mean, ahem printscreen on 1080p
<drf|otherPC> is instant
<Xanbreon> An arm SoC and your desktop are totally diffrent
<Rukario> LOL
<Xanbreon> And OS wise windows and android are very diff
<drf|otherPC> yeah, the phone also isn't running bloated Windows :P
<Rukario> i don't believe i remember that acrynom from graphics class
<Rukario> WYSIWYG
<Xanbreon> What you see is what you get
<drf|otherPC> well brb going back downstairs
<Rukario> yews
<Rukario> *yes
<Xanbreon> Theres more to computers than the clock speed of the main cpu
<Xanbreon> Oh god
<drf|laptop> 03back
<Xanbreon> wb
<drf|laptop> 03the laptop got nice and hot for me
*drf|laptop runs
<Rukario> Xanbreon i forgot to mention we had an active directory lab
<Rukario> where we had to make an OU called Scooby Doo
<drf|laptop> 03LOL active directory
<drf|laptop> 03wait, that exists in Linux too?
<Rukario> and create users using the main characters names
<Rukario> no
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03k
<Rukario> this is for windows server 2008
<Xanbreon> Theres stuff like AE for linux sure
<Rukario> but yeah
<Xanbreon> But mostly you can do what AE does with NFS shares, and login scripts
<Rukario> he told us to make one fix to the active directory structure for the scooby doo lab
<Xanbreon> You only need the bloated mess that is AE due to the registry
<Rukario> i so badly wanted to tell the teacher "Make a directory called "Scooby Doo's Worst Fears"
<Xanbreon> Fun :P
<Xanbreon> Hah
<Rukario> and allow only scooby to read or write to the directory
<Rukario> also... he can only access it from 12:00:00AM to 12:00:01AM
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLWOW
<HyperMetalLugia> so like
<HyperMetalLugia> screw the drive in 60 seconds competition?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drf|laptop> 03DBAN it?
*drf|laptop hides
<Rukario> XD
<Rukario> i wanted to trolololool
<drf|laptop> 03I did a sudo rm -rf / on some Macs at my school
<drf|laptop> 03it was fun
<Xanbreon> Any decent sudo shouldnt let you rm -rf / without warning you
<drf|laptop> 03it's Apple
<drf|laptop> 03derp
<Xanbreon> errr
<Xanbreon> rm binary even
<drf|laptop> 03it's still apple :P
<Rukario> quite honestly though
<Rukario> i'm hating CNA
<NightSeas> 12that's getting old Satin
<drf|laptop> 03CNA?
<Rukario> my grade is starting to drop like a brick
*NightSeas runs
<Rukario> computer network admin
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Rukario> it's the class we are learning windows server in
<HyperMetalLugia> Well hey
<HyperMetalLugia> At least you don't deal with dependencies
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<Rukario> o-o
<Rukario> -.-
<drf|laptop> 03well it's dependent on electricity, a monitor, keyboard/mouse...
<Rukario> the tests are screwing me over
<Xanbreon> TrollLugia
<Rukario> talking about aquired security policies to users and such
<drf|laptop> 03I really want to do what you're doing in college Rukario
<drf|laptop> 03my classes are like raw programing
<drf|laptop> 03I hate it
<drf|laptop> 03I'll trdae you
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<drf|laptop> 03*trade
<Rukario> i'm doing raw programming in PC File Systems
<Rukario> -.-
<Rukario> in a way
<Rukario> we started talking about PERL monday
<HyperMetalLugia> Why perl
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Rukario> would you rather it be bash?
<HyperMetalLugia> eww, use something cooler like...uh, uh, Powershell
<HyperMetalLugia> No.
<drf|laptop> 03<Petersen> damnit
<drf|laptop> 03<Petersen> i just stood on a 512meg dimm
<drf|laptop> 03<Petersen> anyone wanna buy a pair of half length dimms? 256meg each
*HyperMetalLugia run
<HyperMetalLugia> Or just C :V
<HyperMetalLugia> You can't be cool with perl, but you can be C for Cool
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Kyu> 07no
<Kyu> 07no you can't
<Kyu> 07cuz if you know either
<Kyu> 07you're a nerd
*Kyu hides
<drf|laptop> 03<VUlpixLover> making fun of people who can't read is intolerable. you shouldn't say anything mean about them.
<Rukario> o-o
<drf|laptop> 03<NoTruth> Yeah you should write it.
<Rukario> hahahhaha
<Rukario> you are friends with a vulpix lover

<drf|laptop> 03LOL, Rukario
<drf|laptop> 03<brock101> whats speeds should i get over a lan, with a 10/100 connection ?
<drf|laptop> 03<@WheelOr> 10 to 100 Mbits/sec.
<drf|laptop> 03<brock101> -_-
<drf|laptop> 03<brock101> thanks, i knew that
<drf|laptop> 03<brock101> i walked into that one didn`t i
<drf|laptop> 03<@WheelOr> I suppose so.
<Rukario> o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> hurrrrrr
<drf|laptop> 03<voidnull> Computers destroyed my life. Today when my mum told me to get up, I asked her for the password.
<drf|laptop> 03haha
<drf|laptop> 03HyperMetalLugia
<drf|laptop> 03<mutey> whats the lowest priority in linux?
<drf|laptop> 03<smcn> mutey: ease of use
<Rukario> down to 17 pages left
<Rukario> x-x
<Xanbreon> Slightly less than 100Mbps on a 100Mbps port due to overhead
<Xanbreon> :P
<Rukario> here
<Rukario> this looks like a question for Xanbreon :P
<Xanbreon> Hurrhm?
<Rukario> you have set up a shared printer for UNIX and Linux clients, but when you test the setup the printer produces strings of control codes or simply hangs up. which of the following might be the problem?
<junh1024-XD> did you know photoshop CS6 does video & autosave?
<drf|laptop> 03There's a fricking CS6 now?
<Rukario> o-o
<junh1024-XD> CS6 beta
<Xanbreon> Rukario, what are the options?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL betas
<junh1024-XD> sato was rambling about it a few days ago
<junh1024-XD> now I read articles about it
<Rukario> the data type is set to NT EMF and should be RAW
<HyperMetalLugia> Is it decent?
<drf|laptop> 03OMG
<junh1024-XD> seems decent
<drf|laptop> 03<||CHAOS||> they just jumped into bed when i showed them how i added a speaker to my ti-83
<Rukario> you have not set up a GDI client processor for the print quene
<junh1024-XD> tho i haven't tried it
<junh1024-XD> http://www.photoshopuser.com/cs6/cs6-features
<drf|laptop> 03I wish girls were like that around me XD
<drf|laptop> 03I was that guy in high school
<drf|laptop> 03who had everything on his calculator
<Rukario> the data configuration is set to ASCII instead of to binary
<drf|laptop> 03games, whatever, you name it
<Rukario> and the port setup is using port 80, which is for HTTP-based printing instead of UNIX and Linux printing.
<Xanbreon> Hurrhm
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Rukario more for you
<drf|laptop> 03<mchem> what does less do?
<drf|laptop> 03<Rizen> it's like more
<drf|laptop> 03<Rizen> but better
<drf|laptop> 03<aegis> conversations about unix are funny
<Rukario> o-o
<Xanbreon> Oh lol

<Xanbreon> :3
<drf|laptop> 03<Xerox> ...Oh god. Nintendo gave me a preview DVD of apparently quite a lot of their games. I have no DVD player. I do, however, have a PS2. CAN ANYONE SEE THE IRONY HERE!?
<Rukario> :P
<Rukario> me too
<Xanbreon> Do you only chose one answer?
<Rukario> yes
<Xanbreon> Well it does need to be RAW for unix clients
<Rukario> Xanbreon stop googling stuff about me XD
<Rukario> you know unix
<Rukario> they believe in raw data
<Xanbreon> Im googerling ym
<Xanbreon> in *nix, everything is a file
<Xanbreon> :P
<Rukario> lol
<Rukario> lol
<Rukario> lol
<Rukario> sorry

<drf|laptop> 03<PuddleDuck> but now we are just called stalkers :(
<Rukario> this book will never cease to irritate me
<Xanbreon> Windows + servers is a pile of meh tbh
<Rukario> yes
<Rukario> at least unix is simple
<Xanbreon> Mhhmm
<Rukario> at least i have the answers to all the chapters
<Rukario> i found a document that had them
<Rukario> but i don't resort to them right away
<Xanbreon> Was i right about it being A?
<Xanbreon> :P
<Rukario> i'll try to find the answer and if i can't after 10 minutes, then i just take the answer from the document
<Rukario> XD
