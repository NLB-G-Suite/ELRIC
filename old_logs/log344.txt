<popmannn> old man thyme
<herostar> oh god this game is dumber than i thought... the 2d was bad enough, TURN STYLE FIGHTING? WHY WORRY ABOUT ACTA WE MADE THIS ABONIATION?!?!?!?!
<PaperDerp> aka pedobear thyme?
<Equineexcite> Shut up herostar
<SpaceCore> Acta? When did ACTA revive? Acta is old.
<SmoothCheeseCake> its not that bad
<repony> hello?
<anon311> thats my type of bear
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I thought you wubed me though herostar ;___;
<anon311> lol
<eclipse> hi
<PaperDerp> acta is getting noticed again
<repony> finnally
<herostar> its not you sb it's this game
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> NOPE.AVI
<Kammerjunk> SpaceCore: Err... You should probably have a seat.
<metalrainbowdashchan> SuperBrony64: you should get health
<repony> not dead chat room
<SpaceCore> I am.
<SpaceCore> :3
<eclipse> i know
<pony_987> wub wub wub
<repony> yeah
<Kammerjunk> Well... ACTA has been signed by 22 EU nations.
<SmoothCheeseCake> JUMP!!!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'll get health don't wory ^_^
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> KOOPS
<SuperBrony64> 10,02worry*
<SpaceCore> Hol-
<PaperDerp> ACTA will die
<herostar> dont get me wrong i love mario, but when you combine 2d paper and 3d landscape, you unlock a fury not even dragons wanna see in me...
<repony> who's palying
*Sunset morries
<metalrainbowdashchan> SuperBrony64: okay ^_^
<herostar> and i LOATHE turnstyle fighting!!!!
<Kammerjunk> But as far as I know, ACTA still needs the complete approval of the UN.
<SpaceCore> Then why is everyone against SOPA when it's the same as ACTA?
<PaperDerp> but hooktail is a dragon....
<eclipse> idk i am waiting for new mlp episode
<Shrimp3000> Any type of censorship is bad.
<PaperDerp> and you fight her and gloomtail and bonetail
<Equineexcite> The 2D in 2d space is wonderfully played with. You're talking bullcrap
<PaperDerp> 3 dragons are in this game
<SmoothCheeseCake> i liked super mario bowsers in side story and mario and luigi super star saga. those where both great games
<Equineexcite> 2d in 3d*
<Shrimp3000> Anyone can realise that.
<repony> I got kick off halo reach for 1o minutes
<metalrainbowdashchan> love the fourth wall breaking in this game XD
<Kammerjunk> SpaceCore: Actually, ACTA is worse.
<Sunset> ops lol *worries*
<SpaceCore> It is?
<Dr_Cheesums> im bored, i need stuff to satisfy my pony addiction
<SpaceCore> How?
<Linkmaster> I remember this game
<herostar> not at all... i dont see the logic of puting flat in 3d...
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> I know
<PinkiesPieLover> What game is this? Paper Mario the thousand year door>
<Kammerjunk> SOPA doesn't allow every single packet of data you send out to be monitored.
<Linkmaster> 100% completion.
<SpaceCore> oh :<
<PaperDerp> herostar is now my opposite, 2nd favorite game here, #1 is the n64 one
<SmoothCheeseCake> just screw acta all together
<herostar> and again WHY TURNSTYLE IF YOU CAN ATTACK OUTSIDE ALREADY?
<Linkmaster> I want to play it again
<SpaceCore> Then it case, I hate both of them.
<SpaceCore> *in that
<PaperDerp> Sonic Passed Acta.1
<Linkmaster> Thanks for inspireing me
<Shrimp3000> Wait, even japan signed acta. wow.
<XaviortheSavior> lol paperderp
<SmoothCheeseCake> really?
<Kammerjunk> Shrimp3000: The bill was signed in Tokyo.
<Jether99> lol
<SpaceCore> Keep calm and enjoy paper.
<PaperDerp> enjoy me?
<PaperDerp> trollface.jpeg
<Skork> I'll be honest: At first, I thought that the thing following mario was peach's new look
<Kammerjunk> The way I understand it, SOPA and PIPA were ultimatively shelved.
<herostar> WTF?
<Equineexcite> See?
<SmoothCheeseCake> wow...
<eclipse> how did that just happen?
<Equineexcite> Like that
<herostar> game = weirder = more dislike
<SpaceCore> So it's just ACTA?
<repony> wow no one likes rarity
<popmannn> yo umean female miner goomba
<PaperDerp> SOPA and PIPA died cause gamers were gonna boycott E3, afterward ACTA was noticed as th einternational version, they're the new target
<XaviortheSavior> game=weirder=funnier=more like
<repony> 12 ppl damn
<Skork> yea :/
<metalrainbowdashchan> herostar: HOW DARE YOU INSULT THIS GAME :[
<Dr_Cheesums> you found and item called "Mystery"... thats descriptive
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> koops
<SpaceCore> You've got a mystery! You can't use Mystery unless you have Scooby Doo!
<Equineexcite> game=weirder=more interesting
<SmoothCheeseCake> dont piss off metalrainbowdashchan
<Buytoast> I think herostar is just trying to troll poorly at this point.
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> ads
<SpaceCore> ^
<PaperDerp> herostar needs a....derpy accident.......6_9
<Sunset> ^
<Kammerjunk> PaperDerp: It might also have something to do with Google protesting and Google being IMMENSELY powerful.
<SmoothCheeseCake> anyone reading homestuck?
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> lol
<popmannn> ugh, im fading fast
<herostar> im not even trolling i cant seem to get any positive feeling from this game
<XaviortheSavior> or maybe he's giving his honest opinion. who knows?
<SpaceCore> Google is powerful, true dat.
<popmannn> i might have to call it a nigth here soon
<repony> hello there
<Equineexcite> nah, I can understand his point
<PaperDerp> kammerjunk: a lot of reasons made sopa die, mostly E3 and the blackouts
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> u dare me to drink more a.1?
<Skork> one enters as one leaves...
<Equineexcite> Still, I love this game to bits
<Skork> bai pop
<repony> lol

<SaphTheWolf> Digistar: : Same.
<pony_1170> the snouts all wrong

<Amras0000> eeyup
<DJP0N3> its only 11 but im so tired!!!
<dance1211> no point dawexD we already won
<FreezerBurn> eenop
<pony_6539> nnnope
<skyview> site fucked up on my end, and stream died on my end as well
<Phase4> pony_1643, archlinux user here, would not be patient enough to compile all my systems code
<pony_8469> It also works great on a beagleboard-xm.
<pony_6539> BROHOOF
<Digistar> you in the uk?
<pony_6539> Xd
<Aus_Pony> people think it is insulting to disabled
<zyphex> trend #savederpy
<GLaDOS> Yep.
<Thunderpony> Honestly?
<ptrMain> There's a Hell, Michigan
<skyview> my ass!
<Thunderpony> Do they not know bronies exist?
<pony_1643> ah, i use arch on my server
<Goldey> PLEASE take that down it huanted my mind
<Dken2021> this be the first time I'm at this hour on a saturday
<Winter_Shadowhooves> fare enough
<PinkiePie4BestPony> and really, Cupcakes isn't that bad lol?
<Thunderpony> DO THEY NOT KNOW WHO WE ARE?!
<skyview> those people should burn
<d3rb> people can like whatever they like, being critical of people who like 34 is really stupid considering we all like mlp which alot of peolple would call weird
<Amras0000> there's a place in Poland called Hel, I'm not kidding
<pony_1643> gentoo is on my media/mythTV atom pc
<Taco_Pony> looking at japan, their society is SO repressed and structured that... weird things happen to their fetishes...
<Crystal> yup
<skyview> in their hipriacy!
<FreezerBurn> nop
<pony_6539> Last saturday I went to mc donalds with my girlfriend and I ordered a happy meal for the pony
<Winter_Shadowhooves> pony rule 34 is basically bestiality
<Crystal> google it xD
<pony_6539> I have a fluttershy in my room
<pony_1170> those people should quit speaking for the rest of us
<dance1211> they must know bronies exist, the would'nt put her there in the first place otherwise
<Thunderpony> They do something nice for us, and IT'S WRONG!?
<Winter_Shadowhooves> its porn of animals
<pony_1643> needed to tweak stuff which was a pain in arch
<Amras0000> I'm a Pole
<Aus_Pony> Well, if disabled are insulted by it, then sure. But I think the people who brought it up are trying to speak for them.
<Indiana_Dash> I know, right?
<pony_1170> for others
<Thunderpony> It's not insulting, nothing about derpy was disabled.
<PinkiePie4BestPony> not exactly, it's porn of anime
<Phase4> pony_1604, yaourt is bliss, makes life so easy. i'd imagine geento is more configurable though
<Crystal> broohof
<FreezerBurn> happy meal is almost all spongebob here in brazil
<FreezerBurn> :(
<d3rb> is it, or is it peoples attactment to the characters not the poines?
<xcenter> can i somehow close the webirc on the stream site?
<Amras0000> (/
<Phase4> i meen pony_1643
<Indiana_Dash> I agree with you completely, my good sirs
<Winter_Shadowhooves> anime is japanese
<Goldey> Why can't I sleep
<Phase4> stupid tab
<dance1211> except for derpy's arse of lead
<repony> (/
<Taco_Pony> actually, this is a very interesting concept
<Sheepy> is it me or is the stream not working?
<repony> f
<Goldey> nap time I mean refresh time
<InfinityDash> HER ASS IS IRON
<zyphex> derpy's ass is iron!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Uggh...computer went Derpy on me...
<repony> u
<Amras0000> (it's a poundcake brohoof)
<pony_8469> My problem with Arch is they don't take stability seriously.
<Phase4> xcenter, depends on what you meen by close
<Indiana_Dash> lol
<InfinityDash> lol
<InfinityDash> :)
<sleepypony> there
<Digistar> i just refreashed
<PinkiePie4BestPony> like I said, I don't like it, but I won't judge someone for it
<Taco_Pony> it would be xenophilia if the two species are fully senient
<Pinkie> i have never taken a powernap b4
<sleepypony> easier for you to tab me lol
<Phase4> sleepypony, thats better
<ptrMain> Hell, MI http://g.co/maps/32y96
<repony> pound cake hmm?
<Phase4> :)
<Aus_Pony> I'm not fussed really, she's a gift from Hasbro. They could change her name to Ditzy, but she will still be derpy to us. Just like Lyra is Lyra, and not Heartstrings
<pony_1170> its really nice
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> i'm playin well uhh... not sure but two hour i won't wake up so anypony got mine craft?
<xcenter> like, it's annoying to have irssi run here and
<RD> webirc running here
<Taco_Pony> beastiality is if one of the two parties isnt sentient
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Is Sumica here now?
<Winter_Shadowhooves> cartoon porn of animals isnt illegal, but cartoon porn of children is.
<Dken2021> hey pony_# guys, why don't you get a creative nickname? it's fun
<Anthraxbomb> seriously? its still here?
<dance1211> i do
<Phase4> sleepypony, btw, theres a #geek channel with other linux guru's
<FreezerBurn> just to be certain, everyone elses streams are loading too right?
<Blasekun> :O
<pony_1170> lyra was never heartstrings
<Winter_Shadowhooves> but bestiality is illegal
<Samwichwon> ye
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> Wanna play?
<repony> (/(/(/(/(/(/(/(/(/(/(/(/(/(/
<Samwichwon> s
<Taco_Pony> indeed
<Goldey> I can't watch the thing D:
<Winter_Shadowhooves> to watch or to commit
<Crystal> eeeyup
<SuperBrony64> 10,02No channel advertising Phase4 :3
<dance1211> hell yeah
<PinkiePie4BestPony> hmmm, that's actually odd no?
<sleepypony> yea, gentoo, is the most configurable
<FreezerBurn> good, so its not just me
<Egrus> The stream is offline for everyone right?
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> what server?
<xcenter> so i'd like to remove the webirc tab
<Phase4> SuperBrony64, just this once, i promise
<Winter_Shadowhooves> yes
<pony_6539> everyday im buffering
<Samwichwon> aeiou? What happen
<sleepypony> and i have to use specific builds/patches for my media
<Indiana_Dash> well, Goldey, you don't wanna watch this thing
<Taco_Pony> however porn about animals with animals is NOT
<PinkiePie4BestPony> no I still got blue pony
<PinkiePie4BestPony> :x
<Winter_Shadowhooves> same
<repony> bumm bumm bee da doo
<Crystal> hope there will be sparkle ex today xD this always cracks me up xD
<Winter_Shadowhooves> like furry
<ShadowTech> i got no video
<Thunderpony> I signed the petition.
<PinkiePie4BestPony> ill leave and come back I guess
<Egrus> Yeah me too, but it's offline
<Phase4> xcenter, i could pm you some javascript, but i dont realy see the point, just put your client over the top
<d3rb> Its not a black and white issue
<Dken2021> well, time to make some delicious oatmeal
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Furry dosent just mean porn you know
<Samwichwon> Scootaloo has games to plat
<pony_6539> DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
<Rough_Draft> we seem to be having difficulty with the stream...
<repony> @martin u still there
<dance1211> try 176.31.239.138.25598, it's only small cause it's my friends
<Winter_Shadowhooves> i make furry art, but i hate furry porn
<dawexD> my stream is buffering?-.-'
<InfinityDash> The stream isn't streaming right now, they're takinga break
<FreezerBurn> I hope there's a good amount of fluttershy on today's ep
<Winter_Shadowhooves> its wrong
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> k
<Phase4> sleepypony, what sort of patches?
<zyphex> Nopony has the right to speak for somepony else. I have severe memory issues. Forget where the fuck I am and what I'm doing half the time, and I love our little filly Derpy
<Skillfulist> still buffering :(
<dawexD> k
<repony> probably
<Taco_Pony> the entire point about beastiality being illegal is that one of the organisms cannot give consent, which is why i think rule 34 mlp might not qualify as beastiality
<xcenter> R1A
<DJP0N3> yes, yes we do
<pony_1170> oiy o thought things died
<Thunderpony> Isn't derpy a mom though?
<Faith> oh no, this looks just fine...
<Winter_Shadowhooves> but if people like that stuff im okay with that
<pony_6539> but, isnt it about rainbow dash_
<pony_6539> _
<sleepypony> well i had to patch mythtv for the new libbluray support
<Phase4> dat 0x0016
<pony_6539> ...
<Winter_Shadowhooves> so bestiality is rape
<repony> but why is shein hospital
<FreezerBurn> yes
<Martin> 6_9
<pony_6539> (*&^%$#@#$%^&*()_
<pony_1170> fannon
<DJP0N3> black...
<pony_6831> HEY HEY HEY
<Taco_Pony> basicly
<sleepypony> and ffodivxvdpau support
<xcenter> to bed it's flash
<Winter_Shadowhooves> wrong
<Crystal> its about what happened to rainbow after rarity beat her xD
<Thunderpony> So was derpy up until a few weeks ago
<FreezerBurn> because Rarity said she would get back at RD for leaving her with pinkie
<Phase4> pony_6831, hi krusty
<Winter_Shadowhooves> it is totally wrong
<pony_6539> XDD
<Egrus> It's still bad porn, even if I liked it.
<xcenter> nvm, closing it down till strem starts
<Winter_Shadowhooves> i wont judge you
<PinkiePie4BestPony> yeah, I won't watch hentai even
<sleepypony> hang on phase, let me log into xchat, easier
<pony_6539> I would have enjoyed being with pinkie saying CHIMICHERRY CHERRICHANGA
<Rough_Draft> I really like the rotating white line, that accentuates the black background in such a curious way...
<repony> or after cupcakes
<PinkiePie4BestPony> it's just weirddd to me.
<pony_1170> they changed it back I think
<ptrMain> They found all the pieces in the cupcakes and put RD back together.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> hentai is just funny.
<To> So anyone want to speculate on how the new episode will be?
<Crystal> say it thousand times in a row
<Winter_Shadowhooves> it has no sexual value to me
<Winter_Shadowhooves> its just wtf
<PinkiePie4BestPony> it kind of is a joke
<ShadowTech> derpy this derpy that wtf guys?!
<ShadowTech> you guys have way too much fear
<Taco_Pony> would you watch hentai if it were two fully sentient adults consenting to it?
<InfinityDash> derpy derpy derpy derpy
<sleepypony> i'm DJ_Sleepypony
<repony> but i ate one of those cupcakes

<repony> what about my little dashie
<SuperBrony64> 10,02No talk about Cupcakes.
<Skitsmore> Goodnight
<To> I hope so
<Thunderpony> Didn't people complain about PPG being to violent? That didn't stop it from continuing. I'm sure lauren is probably thinking "Yeah, that's nice people. We're not changing anything."
<pony_6539> ok
<PinkiePie4BestPony> yeah, I wouldn't beat my meat to it, hell, I probably couldn't
<Phase4> night SuperBrony64 , sleep well

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Some IRC clients screw that up.

<Phase4> its our clients, must be configurable
<Lium> ...there are no bronettes
<repony> pone
<Egrus> Indeed
<Crystal> throws a pokebal at the pokemone appearently named "pony"

<Indiana_Dash> lol zyphex good to know
<Phase4> streams off
<darkdash> oh god winter watched shed didnt he!?
<Goldey> yes okay. get over it
<ptrMain> That's because some clients don't use the standard mIRC color codes

<ChunkyLover> Who cares about gender, race or sexuality. everyone is equal!
<darkdash> *F**K
<PinkiePie4BestPony> I think that, if in a story would be more gore then the fanfic
<DJ_Sleepypony> yea on xchat SuperBrony64|Zzz it's unreadable

<kirdaiht> Well, Assuming you watched shed.mov, you watched the inside of fluttershy's shed, containing disceted woodland critters nailed to the wall, followed by derpy as a toastercover, a song about eating brains, rainbowdash being murdered with a chainsaw and fluttershy getting arrested and locked up in a mental institution.
<Pinkie_> Anti-biotics and pouring a light solution of water / H2O2 soloution.

<Scootaloo> OMG
<Packdude24> How did you sleep last night after that?
<pony_777> didn't notice
<Discord> I think I have the WORST internet out there.
<Ponygirl82> sorry not very techie with the vocab
<Scootaloo> MUST SEE
<Th3Hat3d> who hasnt seen SHED.MOV
<threwthedoor> Were there dinosaurs in prehistoric Equestria?
<Hazard3> dat jazz
<Discord> It's the worst I have seen xD
<diddutz> ah, ok JTDrift, i was just confused cuz my name is Titus, too. ^^
<King> Coooome oooonnnn~
<EmperorJewel> Yeah don't blame you.
<pony_7133> SEPERATING U AND I
<Turbo740> me
<Dimmet> Pinkie awesome face.
<gato> Ohhh I like this vid...
<Pendragon> i hate to say this but ponies cannot beat the video for this song
<pony_7133> REAL REASON
<EndCreditsMan> Its totally legit
<BRONYXD> 1 HOUR 22 MINS
<RaveBrony> o.O
<Samwichwon> play gen 3 opening
<pony_5131> :D
<kirdaiht> There still are.
<zonic17game> it would be great if DJ-P0N3 appeats in this episode
<Indiana_Dash> Everypony's seen SHED.MOV c'mon
<Septavia> dino-ponies?
<pony_7133> ASKING WHY
<Shadec> What's this genre of music called....Electric swing or something?
<Turbo740> is it a new one of the parodies?
<Zander> I had a bet with my freind that if it does snow then ill burn my Skyrim Disk.....:'(
<Pinkie_Is_Best_Pony> WHILE I EAT YOUR BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN
<Hazard3> NO!
<pony_7133> THATS TREASON
<EmperorJewel> But most everypony is an earth pony in gen 3
<FreezerBurn> dubstep
<Turbo740> like apple and dress.mov
<SaphTheWolf> Scootaloo ; It's apparantly REALLY gory/
<Skitsmore> I need sleep D:
<Derpimena> it's like an average Zutara v. Kataraang fight
<Packdude24> I had to sleep with the light on after that :D
<pony_7133> AND ITS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU
<TheSonicdude97> dang ad!
<Rough_Draft> I don't think they'll change _____'s name. And besides, they can't keep us from using it.
<repony> ad no
<Pinkie_Is_Best_Pony> Play SHED.MOV
<pony_777> just dump it along with blues
<munky433> you fool
<Ponygirl82> it's just a wank connection because its DSL
<Glutton_Chops> Play The Last Roundup
<RaveBrony> Dat lag
<Armando92> i am going to prepare some cereal, this gonna take some time
<ptrMain> That piano is distracting
<Indiana_Dash> RAVE
<EndCreditsMan> its like the site knows i dont have a facebook
<Zander> And it's Snowing
<Skitsmore> But I can't
<Davie_Jones> It's not very technical. A modem is what brings the information in from the IP though ether a phone line or a cable line. The router splits it up.
<Calycibos> NO, THERE WERE JUST CHICKENS, MARSHMALLOWS, AND DICTIONARIES.
<Blackmane> We already got indiana brony.
<Ponygirl82> it was faster on cable
<PinkiesPope> Worst internet in all of equestria is in Celestias garden
<Shadec> Piano is always good.
<NHK_aussie> this song
<Turbo740> brb then
<Hazard3> G3 i think needs to be....burned
<pony_777> lump*
<pony_7133> Its a cross of jazz and... dance?
<pony_4331> lol
<Shadec> So is bass.
<Dken2021> FreezerBurn no, it's not that genre
<Blackmane> :P
<pony_9427> wonder what they're gonna do with twilight
<PinkiePieFTW> we got another hour and a half
<Randomnerd> Hey everyone.
<flutter_spin> I don't really care for this song.
<gato> *should try to find the original song some time*
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> twilight die 4 ur sins
<Pinkie_Is_Best_Pony> Shed.Mov should so play.
<Samwichwon> 3.5 opening!
<SaphTheWolf> I haven't seen it yet, my brain is too....horrid.
<Gameman246> Maybe Equestria is Earth after 2012
<Th3Hat3d> I love how they made the song for shed the fat albert theme
<JTDrift> lol. and how creppy would it be if I just randomly knew you?
<EndCreditsMan> hey
<ohmygodponies> how long now?
<Tervicz> Chickens are diosaurs
<pony_7133> This song is by goldfish.
<zonic17game> im not a fan of SHED.MOV :C
<Samwichwon> play it!
<FreezerBurn> SB says we can't talk shed.mov
<Gameman246> *Mind blown*
<Dermathil> pinkie_is_Best_Pony: AFAIK it is not a discussion matter on bronystate
<Doorman> what is this song?
<TTG> NON-PINKIE'S OFF THE DANCEFLOOR
<Effortless> The internet here in AK isn't bad but it's not very reliable
<Rayne> Pinkie Pie's room must be loving it right now
<ZokZokMeister> love this song
<Iweywrt> Hi people!
<AllyOmega> I personally love the name____ more than Ditzy.
<Hazard3> this song is epic
<Pinkie_Is_Best_Pony> ...Oh,okay.
<p13rr07> look at countdown
<repony> lol
<Crystal> whoa
<pony_7133> I like... but thier other ones are better.
<SteampunkFridge> :P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P
<pony_4331> lol
<sonicrainboomer259> do apple.mov (:
<mmmmmmuffins> SHIT
<Indiana_Dash> It's all in good fun, eh
<Packdude24> It creeped me the f**k out.
<Skitsmore> Wut
<Pinkie_Is_Best_Pony> We can't do shed.mov
<kirdaiht> A non firebreathing dragon is pretty much a dinosaur.
<DeltaKilo3> ok used br and got breakfast what i miss?
<Orange_Peel> kirdaiht: Exactly. The only scrubbing was Apple store and temporary at WLF. Sounds like an IP issue, and since WLF is selling DERPY stuff again, it's probably fixed.
<gato> Ponies have opened my ears to a lot of unknow artists
<Ponygirl82> but cannot have cable in this building not allowed
<Wrek> 05hi Iweywrt
<pony_453> Acid trip?
<GlowyPie> dem rainbooms
<threwthedoor> We all evolve into ponies
<Vlad_Logimane> ...
<Blackmane> THE EYES !

<SteampunkFridge> O.O
<EndCreditsMan> dont trash talk g 1-3, they are what made faust want to make this
<Vlad_Logimane> dat dash
<SaphTheWolf> How bad is it? Some people compared it to IT.
<Scootalooney> SHED.MOV was better than DRESS.MOV
<mmmmmmuffins> THE EYES
<flutter_spin> Gala 20% cooler my favorite
<Winter_Shadowhooves> going shopping afterwoulds, getting blindbag ponies
<Blackmane> LOOK AWAY!
<PonyCin> But I might miss ponies!
<pony_7133> Boing... boing...
<Hazard3> its like this song was made for this show
<Crystal> yeach
<brauseponee> whats this music?
<FreezerBurn> I know it's not
<String_Shredder> only G1
<Indiana_Dash> But NOTHING beats APPLE.MOV
<Davie_Jones> Well yes, cable is a lot better and if you are going to be watching streams or doing anything that is requiring a lot of bandwith, it's worth the extra money.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>check stream
<Dken2021> I like how people think electronic, synth instruments = dubstep
<gato> (I would say msuic genres, but I was already quite open mnded about that)
<Crystal> give us gala 20%
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>Goldfish
<Davie_Jones> Sorry to hear that.
<Dermathil> EndCreditsMan: actually only G1.
<Th3Hat3d> Dash is my favorite but uve got to admit shed was pretty damn good
<EmperorJewel> wub wub wub?
<Hazard3> true story
<Egrus> The audio at least isn't lagging anymore
<TheSonicdude97> play sonic rainboom episode, wanna see that again
<Pendragon> this is goldfich

<Gameman246> If only, threwthedoor, if only.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm sooooooo okay with it
<BallisticSleep> Spike needs an MOV
<Winter_Shadowhooves> I need four more figures
<InfinityDash> Indiana_Dash: true dat
<PerryThePony> hold on let me run something past you guys really fast
<SteampunkFridge> apple.mov is best
<JayDee> I want ponycore not this
<Generaallucas> threwthedoor: no thanks, i like having fingers
<Pendragon> goldfich*
<Davie_Jones> Wait... does that mean you have Satalite TV?
<JayDee> :3
<pony_7774> shed.mov was way too disturbing for me
<PONI> 1 HOUR!
<Glutton_Chops> I want to see any season 2 episode
<gato> *music
<Goldey> *goes behind Blackmane and puts her hoove on his or her shoulder* Boo.

<Claudio> ÑÑÑñññññÑÑ
<Gameman246> I'd much rather wings than fingers. That or a horn.
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> i i can't do it
<Ponygirl82> nope no tv at all can't afford the license

<Effortless> I wish I had those blind bag ones...
<SteampunkFridge> Discord lol
<Rough_Draft> If the thing we love about the ponies is their humanity, why should we want to lose our own to be like them? I never understood.
<PinkiePie4BestPony> I have the complete opposite haha
<Orange_Peel> threw: So would I. But corporate Hasbro has nixed that idea.
<TheSonicdude97> shufle

<Discord> We should combine our collection, pinkie4bestpony
<Derpimena> they don't really show her as much as they should
<SaphTheWolf> wow

<Matthew_Pie> I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!
<Hazard3> epic montage
<zonic17game> dat rarity shuffle :3
<AllyOmega> Meh, I don't like the idea of using a side character for too many episodes. Maybe a Celestia-Luna centric episode. That would be great.
<pony_9427> gummy doesn't give a hay
<Iron_Raptor> :D
<PinkiePie4BestPony> Canada doesn't get that much merchandise
