<GentleHeaven> actually... probably before 38, czechoslovakia is invaded then and it causes a stirr
<pinkiederp> dun dun dunnnn
<Dinoclor> I keep mishearing this.
<CCCP> this movie and Indy 3 were the best
<EzioClarke> this is way more interesting that the 4 movie
<Czymsim> Tits are the best tits

<Singed_Iz_Brony> You've never seen this b4?
<Dr_Fumbles> Only saw Crystal Skull
<Stan> Nathan carries himself but Lara needs to carry herself and her huge breasts in dangerous locations. Of course Lara is more badass.
<Flootershai21> Ill be on :3
*Rain catches the chocolate bacon in her mouth
<Singed_Iz_Brony> omg

<Dinoclor> What were you laughing at anyways?
<richfiles> Quality is lower, due to lack of second pass encoding, and fine tuning options... But I have a hardware h.264 encoder that DOES free up a lot of my CPU when I encode.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Call on the seaponies

<SonicRainboom> It wasn't.
<Dken2021> pinkiederp: shut up!
<Jim> The kingdom of the Crystal Skull was the worst Indiana Jones film
<Twitch> Lags
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> They made fun of Crystal skull in Fallout New vegas
<Czymsim> are you sure you're a man in 100%?
<Fazana> and BUGGER, how much Indy Jones did I miss?
<AgentKalim> Because fuck you that's why
<LightningChaser> I'm sorry
<CCCP> hi Fazana
<RedCaptain> Dat eye framing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hid in a nuclear blast to escape a fridge.
<Twitch> Eh, sotha?
<DashieBro> wait, why are we watching Indiana Jones :(
<CosmicLatte> I like my women small. Especially since I'm only 5'2"..
<LightningChaser> he asked for it
<derp> i liked crystal skull
<Hotpotat0> erm
<Dandelo2> This is around WW2, or before. Shouldn't he be bribing here in British pound notes? Would be worth more than USD...
<SonicRainboom> ^
<LordDerpington> Only about 20 mins in, Fazana
<SonicRainboom> True, dat.
<[ger]Brony1> I love the comic where RBD was reading the Daring Do 4 book. lol
<Czymsim> maybe not 100%
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> If you have the Wild Wasteland trait, you can find a skelleton in a fridge
<EzioClarke> whooou thats racist! theres no applejack!
<Jim> I saw that Fazana, a skeleton in a fridge
<Hotpotat0> i feel hurt D:
<pinkiederp> Dken2021: no i'm good
<Midnight_Jones> That happened years ago Ishdiana
<CosmicLatte> I like my men tall and my women tiny.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I found it funny
<richfiles> I used to run Linux on my PS3, but then my OtherOS took Sony's firmware to the knee.
<Meanwhile> Well, may your relationship go smoothly and bring you much joy and all that jazz.
<pinkiederp> i'm not hurting anybody, AM I?
<richfiles> :$
<sotha> You said you have only seen Crystal Skull. I said Oh poor Twitch, but did the wrong name.
<pony-1826> Thank you JESUS
<Fazana> I've seen them all

<Garrus_Vakarian> well im off, see you guys later.
<Fazana> becausew I pwn like that
<Czymsim> maybe your liver is a girl and that would make you less than 100% man

<Phase4> by Garrus_Vakarian
<Fazana> Oh yeah

<Twitch> a whip-crack with his whippy... whip.
<AppleJackDaniels> That scene was intese when I was in another tab
<Blaze7> ^
<SteveCharb> yup

<AppleJackDaniels> Daring Doo is kicking serious ass
<aaallen23> wat u guys think of the new episode
<Hippie> Hmmmkay
*Derpy123 leaves of boredom
<SonicRainboom> Pinkie Pie is hyperactive. I had ADHD, and I find that offensive.
<owlicious> I find the princesses offensive to anarchists
<Singed_Iz_Brony> it was wonderous
<Twitch> Cos it was the scream by Private Wilhelm
<Noir> now that was silly, could he have just grabed the chain and thus save his whole hand from being burned?
<Hippie> Didn't know :P
<Dken2021> because wilhelm
*Meanwhile headbutts Ishdiana_Jones in the face.
<Twitch> When he was shot in a movie.
<LordDerpington> After the character in the first movie it was used in, I think.
<SteveCharb> yeah the youtube isn't up yet
<AgentKalim> It was predictable but masterfully executed
<richfiles> Software bottlenack?
<SteveCharb> no spoilers
<Midnight_Jones> This thing is sitting in the fire. Do you think it might be hot?
<Jim> The Wilhelm Scream is a running gag by the sound team in hollywood
*Ishdiana_Jones bacon slaps Meanwhile
<Dr_Fumbles> I thought it was awesome, though a little cliche
<kirzstryfe> 1,3because then he wouldn't be a stupid nazi
<derp> look out we got a badass
<LightningChaser> I forgot about how much I love these movies
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Isnt the scream in pretty much every movie?
<TheToto1000> sounds like derpy
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Any action movie anyway
<pony_497> Did I miss something?
<RoflBot> DUN DUN DUN
<SteveCharb> hmmm
<Twitch> More or less
<Fazana> Lets travel by Red Line
<Hotpotat0> PARTNER
<Ohfour> The orginal scream was used for a guy being eaten by an allogator i beleive
<Twitch> For the lulz
<Meanwhile> I'm the god damn batman!
<Midnight_Jones> http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg21/scaled.php?server=21&filename=buddharl.jpg&res=medium

<sotha> Righto, there! derp, old chap.
<PinkiePieCopy> Datmap
<richfiles> And no flying feathers were given that day :(
<Singed_Iz_Brony> its the execution that matters
<Dr_Fumbles> yeah
<Twitch> Nah, I think he got shot in the leg by indians or something
<Onyxiaz> theme song
<Dr_Fumbles> indeed
<RedCaptain> I'M YOUR GORRAM PARTNER SHEPARD
<[ger]Brony1> I am a misanthrope and i find friendship offensive!
<richfiles> LOL :D
<Noir> Oh yeah, dumb nazi, thats right.
<Czymsim> pony_497, yes, a rape scene
<Twitch> misanthrope?
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Im offensive and I find this Buddist
<SteveCharb> where's de monkey
<Cygnus> And mad Nazi :D
<LordDerpington> I am a rationalist and I find magic offensive!
<Fluttertroll> its Nazi Monkey AGAIN!!!!
<Jim> I am dumb, I find Twilight's smartness offensive
<qJesse> Pretty c:
<AppleJackDaniels> I have a tarus pt1911 and it has an 8 round mag, but givin the time period of this movie it would be 7 rounds
<fluttercry> 05,15The original Wilheim screem came from a western movie where a guy got stabbed in the leg with an arrow
<SteveCharb> there he is
<Phase4> i think either he's got an i7 with hyperthreading or handbreak is configured to only use 4 threads
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Remember, there's a 24h no spoiler rule
<[ger]Brony1> The original scream was a cowboy getting hit by an arrow.
<Dken2021> well the swastika was used as a symbol of peace until nazis came
<beepbeep> go to places, melts faces, and then saves the daaayayayayaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy
<Twitch> Close enough.
<pony_497> D:
<RoflBot> SPOILER ALERT... THATS A MONKEY
<Fazana> Leg?
<Singed_Iz_Brony> oh
<derp> awww monkey
<Jim> He took an arrow to the knee
<Kipkat07> im offensive and I find that metrosexual
<SteveCharb> that monkey's a zombie
<Fazana> You mean knee :3
<Dr_Fumbles> not spoiling
<PrincessCadence> wich movie is this?
<Noir> funky monkey.
<Singed_Iz_Brony> wasnt really spoiling though
<owlicious> but the nazi's reversed it to clockwize
<pony_497> Are y'all watching Indiana Jones too?
<AgentKalim> I didn't say crap
<smallfish> I am a chicken and I find links offensive
*Meanwhile still cba.
<Ishdiana_Jones> the monkey is a spy
<Phase4> probably an i7
<TheToto1000> that monkey's a spy!
<Ohfour> A backwards swwashica is still used in some places
<Singed_Iz_Brony> ;p
<Hotpotat0> monkey wants boobs
<owlicious> and the buddha also has a clockwise one

<Czymsim> Demopan is the best pan
<SteveCharb> and Guatemala must have the worst internet outside of africa
<[ger]Brony1> Harrison Ford ALLWAYS shoots first.
<Singed_Iz_Brony> good question
<Dr_Fumbles> yeah
<Twitch> The pen is mightier than the swords but actions speak louder than words.

<Skrmshsh> best scene ever
<LightningChaser> tis a lie
<Fluttertroll> gun!
<beepbeep> OKAY
<Kencolt> There's an interesting story about that scene. There was supposed to be a big dramatic fight -- whip to blade-- and it was all set up... and Ford had a cold that day. Felt like crap. And said, "If I'm carrying this gun, why don't I just shoot him?" Spielberg liked the idea.... and it passed into legend as one of the great scenes in Film.
<CK|Asleep> Miniboss
<dragonborn> hilarious part
<Czymsim> Gun is the best pony
<Fazana> Yammonster, isn't that Mother 3?
<Dr_Fumbles> I suddenly caught a bad case of the lag...
