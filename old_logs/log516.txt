<Reikim> So much nostalgia from this.
<LightningDashFast> 6_9
<PinkiePieCopy> Stream freeze?
<Reikim> This was my first exposure to brony music.
<RaveBrony> SlurryMoon: Really?? :O Intensive Pony Unit showed me the show :)
<killerpony7733> Yahooz: i guess so :D
<Ninjazz> Om, I'm not pickey! This song... is just not even... that good. >.>
<Alister> I like how the ''Original version'' links to the ytpmv rather than THE ACTUAL SONG AVAST YOUR ASS
<Yahooz> My first exposure was Shes a Pony Tombstone remix
<Petrified_Discord> My first pony video made me think that Twilight was the villain :D
<Yahooz> followed by Alex S and PinkiePieSwear stuffs
<PinkiePieCopy> My first exposure was SUnshine and Celary Stalks
<RaveBrony> Petrified_Discord: Lol what?? :D
<SolairePony89> My first exposure to the fandom was on the Escapist
<LightningDashFast> yep She's a PONY is best PMV
<Kencolt> Petrified_Discord: Well, THAT'S a major misconception.
<MahBoi777> so much yay
<killerpony7733> I honestly don't remember where i first noticed MLP FIM but i knew about it very close to when it was made i tink
<Reikim> Alister: I sense much rage. 'Tis parallel to otakon's.
<Ninjazz> My first exposure was a spray on TF2. It wasn't NFSW.
<Ninjazz> was*
<MahBoi777> O_o
<owlowscious> Ninjazz: oh
<MahBoi777> oh mai
<Ninjazz> mhmm
<LightningDashFast> O.o
<RaveBrony> When i was first introduced to the brony fandom, it made me think RD was the main character O_o
<Alister> Reikim: I think it's a perfect example of how self-centered our fandom can be
<Ninjazz> Hater was born.
<owlowscious> i was wondering why you would say it wasn't
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> the first time i ever got into MLP F.i.M was when i was fighting a server admin who was a brony
<Yahooz> Ninjazz: thats a shame
<PinkiePieCopy> Ninjazz: So it WAS safe for Woona?
<Petrified_Discord> It was Portal's "Want you Gone" and the way she hooked up Pinkie Pie to the science...thing...made it seem like she was the "sciency" one that didn't believe in the magic of friendship :D
<Reikim> Alister: Someone hasn't been around long if you think it only applies to our fandom.
<Ninjazz> PinkiePieCopy, Nnnnope.
<SlurryMoon> 3Okay and with this last repeat of Das Boot, Wrek is going to take over.
<LightningDashFast> eeeyup
<MahBoi777> mine was YTP
<PinkiePieCopy> Ninjazz: So it wasn't safe for luna?
<PinkiePieCopy> Er, Woona?
<RaveBrony> Wrek time!?! :3
<otakon> Reikim: I'm not ragin atm, I'm just worried I'll have to take my PC apart to satiate my mother. and I don't want to do that bc THIS place and the peopel I've met here is the ONLY reason I haven't gone into a soul crushing depression sinc I've been out of work
<Kencolt> In my case, it was reading a random article-- somewhere-- I don't remember where-- and thinking, "Maybe I should check thyis out." I was bucking DOOMED after that.
<LightningDashFast> yay
<Yahooz> Wreky stream :3
<RAWRity> When I first saw somebody talking about MLP, they kept talking about "Derpy" in episodes. I thought there was an actualy, canon main character in the show called Derpy Pony.
<Ninjazz> PinkiePieCopy, I don't think she would have liked to see Pinkie Pie in that way. :(
<Om> Play it again!
<Panda> Yahooz: but i dont wanna be depressed by his streams :(
<Alister> Reikim: What I'm saying the guy should have given credit to Renard for making the song
<RAWRity> and lo-and-behold, a year after that, it became half-right.
<VenHur96> Now stop, Wrek time!
<Om> -__-
<LightningDashFast> O.o

<Ninjazz> Om, you should have been there when I was on.
<Reikim> Alister: It's an isolated case and you shouldn't take it as representative of the entire fandom, and above all it does not merit that much rage.
<Alister> Reikim: But someitmes they forget about the original
<Ninjazz> PinkiePieCopy, agree to the fullest. I became a hater that day.
<Om> I don't know if I want to after hearing that.

<Ninjazz> I wish Id was stronger than it is.
<Reikim> SolairePony89: Properties they own.
<CriticKitten> Nonsense. EA makes games.
<WindWhistler> And DON'T shoot it down because they changed Spyro
<pony_0022> There's that godawful buffer again
<CriticKitten> And then runs them into the ground.

<MahBoi777> :1
<CriticKitten> Reikim: They publically declared that Dead Space 3 needs to sell 5 million copies to be a marketable item (because they've spent way too fucking much on it), so they effectively redesigned it to ".
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because of our shared views of how game companies are ruining gaming and gamers that let it happen.
<Reikim> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Mm?
<CriticKitten> "appeal to a broader audience"

<Saturn> 08,01you should know this by now
<Om> DeathStar: Fair enough.
<Ninjazz> Oh, hey, DeathStar!
<Reikim> pony_0022: Friendship = magic, therefore the answer is friendship.
<Kyu> 07also, ya I just read the text
<HyperMetalLugia> Have you met Katy Perry yet?
<DeathStar> Om: as much as I wish I could Dance on here 24/7 I can't :(
<Irish_Pony> anypony?
<pony_0022> Saturn: i know this. i has a celly beach towel and a celly blanket, also a mcdonalds pinklestia

<Devonx25> on*
<Iron_Edge> Irish_Pony: your asking me what I would feel if I saw Major the Marine pony....in a bunny outfit?
<Reikim> friendship = magic = witchcraft = satanism = the Devil, therefore Friendship = the Devil. Are there any problems with this logic train?
<DeathStar> Irish_Pony: zap-apple*
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wat
<SolairePony89> Devonx25: We do on Friday and Saturday

<WindWhistler> Speaking of which, I don't have an OC either
<Yahooz> le gasp

<Irish_Pony> A friend of mine drew mine :)
<DeathStar> Irish_Pony: well then just go as far with that as your comfertable remember your feelings are important too

<Reikim> Saturn: Fallen angel vampire scot? Be very afraid.

<pony_0022> Nittany_Discord: you cant do that. Saturn is a gas planet
<Irish_Pony> DeathStar: Thats why I love her so much just to go as far as to put on a bunny outfit for her :)
<WindWhistler> Saturn: Better pray she doesn't sparkle
<Reikim> Saturn: On the other hand, a fallen angel badass vampire wielding a claymore sounds awesome.
<valoreins|Drawing> sparkle sparkle
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01$1,115/$2,500. Not enough people want to see Maid Discord enough or help a few people out.
<Irish_Pony> Fuck ya sparkle sparkle sparkle!

<Irish_Pony> Saturn: O_O????
<pony_0022> Nittany_Discord: like i said, i would but cant. my mom controls my paypal, and doesn't believe in charity
<Reikim> Saturn: I remember hearing a story about Glasgow Airport. Apparently some terrorists drove a car into the place, and may or may not have put a bomb in it. So one of the guys comes out, he's on fire, and one of the native Glaswegians just walks up and punches him in the face. So yeah, be afraid.
<Saturn> 08,01he looks like a big strong farm worker, though
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane pokes Saturn

<MahBoi777> Om: or a sax lol
<Reikim> Saturn: Yeah no.
<Ninjazz> Om, I was thinking something along that line. But went with my obsession with Rarity instead. :D
<Yahooz> LuigiNut02: mods stream what they feel like streaming during weekdays
<Yahooz> so who knows?
<Om> MahBoi777: Yeah, But those are hard to make so tiny
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> LuigiNut02 depends on your definition of REAL show and the streamer
<Ninjazz> RainBowJack, what do you think I should name it? :S

<Saturn> 08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: meh to you too, good sir
<WindWhistler> though that begs the question...what would her cutie mark look like?
<Ninjazz> Roughcut...
<Reikim> LuigiNut02: One of the best parts of this site is the variety. There's game streaming, and then there's anime, and then there's ponies, and then there's the Internet's most drugged-up crap.
<RainBowJack> Ninjazz : okay
<MahBoi777> Spectrum_Rush: brilliant name!
<Dken2021> WindWhistler anything she wants it to be
<Spectrum_Rush> MahBoi777: ikr
<Reikim> Saturn: Yeah, that's not too bad! But he gives a damn creepy stare.
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: Wouldn't that be a bit Sue-ish?
<pony_0022> Fuck it i'm bored watching this.
<Reikim> Saturn: Like, if you look at it too long, you start to get scared.

<Irish_Pony> btw guys Im gonna have my friend draw my OC in a bunny outfit, i want it to be a suprise for Gamer_Luna (aka Bunny_Maid_Luna) so when she comes on dont say anything or I will end you :[

<Ninjazz> Irish_Pony, maybe it was best not to even tell us? :S
<Saturn> 08,01not so much a child molester
<Reikim> WindWhistler: Also he left his razor on the stublle setting.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: His Eyes.... all you need to determine
<Panda> Saturn is best assassin :)
<WindWhistler> Saturn is best planet
<Yahooz> Feed me Seymore

<Reikim> Saturn has many rings made of ice chunks and is inhospitable.
<WindWhistler> Yahooz: Reference to..../
<Om> I wouldn't think of a gas giant as anywhere near an example of stealth
<Yahooz> WindWhistler: little shop of horrors :3
<MahBoi777> Stealth
<Yahooz> idk it was kinda random
<WindWhistler> Saturn is a giant ball of gas
<SolairePony89> Saturn is best assassian planet
<Reikim> Yahooz: Audrey 2. I built a giant Audrey 2 out of wood, chicken wire and fabric once.
<WindWhistler> ........that doesn't sound right
<Yahooz> Reikim: to scale? niccccce
<WindWhistler> Saturn can float in a bath tub.
<Reikim> WindWhistler: It's a great musical.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> AJ ded
<WindWhistler> Okay I'm done.

<Irish_Pony> http://silverskystrike.deviantart.com/#/d3grwir Epic :D
<MahBoi777> hey Iron_Edge, how are you?
<Reikim> Yahooz: Dunno if to scale, but it was big enough that working on the top was semi-dangerous. Also the chicken wire did a real number on my hands =.=
<Saturn> 08,01dear lord
<Iron_Edge> MahBoi777: Sup bro /)
<Reikim> WindWhistler: You're thinking Pet Shop of Horrors.

<Saturn> 08,01dat feeling when you find a friend on a dating site, and it suggests her as a a "92% match"
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: Google... that is all
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Iron_Edge> SolairePony89: uhhh.....ok? -lol
<Saturn> 08,01Irish_Pony: i'll take your answer
<Reikim> Saturn: Dating friends can get awkward...
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: ikr
<WindWhistler> Saturn: We're all descendents of Sherlock Holmes
<Saturn> 08,01dear lord, i know...
<Om> I wouldn't know
<Irish_Pony> Yay my answer is the best :)
<CriticKitten> How do you open up that conversation, I wonder? "....so....I saw you on this dating site....and we're a 92% match. Wanna hook up?"
<Saturn> 08,01WindWhistler: that man, what a stud
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: we know :)
<Saturn> 08,01Spectrum_Rush: goddamnit...
<Yahooz> Which one? Movie one or TV series??
<Reikim> Saturn: On the other hand, it can sometimes work nicely. I have a friend who dated another friend, and when they broke up, it was very clean.
<Dken2021> CriticKitten oh the chemistry
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: the exact message i sent to her was "So apparently, we should totally have sex. According to computers."

<Reikim> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Do you have a problem with sexy?

<Ninjazz> ^

<RaveBrony> O.o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> remember anyone who tries to get to fluttershy has to deal with repeated murder attempts by angel
<RainBowJack> i would hug her tightly
<WindWhistler> And it hurts even more that everyone is so distracted by a sexy Fluttershy...
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim btw you can do anything about him cause then you would know flutterage
<WindWhistler> Well, I'm gonna attempt to draw a full pony figure...
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Oh you underestimate me. There are ways to deal with him without causing him any harm. It usually involves a crapton of money, carrots, drugs, or all three.
<WindWhistler> But it'll be nothing to gawk. Don't be too disappointed.
<SolairePony89> I wanna see Wrek do a saucy Big Mac pic, just for the lulz
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SolariePony89: oh god no

<RainBowJack> Wrek : really why does FlutterShy have that massive wing Boner?
<SolairePony89> FlareChaser: Sexi Fluttershy
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: What should I give? My innocence? Lost that ages ago. My childhood? Rotten and defiled at this point. I'm out of ideas here.
<Devonx25> aww fuck. i missed the beginning.
<WindWhistler> RainBowJack: She doesn't have a wingboner...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> FlareChaser: Fluttershy doing something

<FairysHuff> Morning every pony. I finally got a little sleep after over doing the painkillers yesterday ^_^ only 4 hours but hey I'll take it.
<RyunosukeKnT> Flarechaser, there was a fanfic that described humans quite accurately. "Humans are imaginative creatures, anything you can possibly think of, someone has taken that idea, and taken it four steps further." :)

<SolairePony89> Silence... calm before the storm
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: But it's not about if everyone knows here. It's about whether or not the victim knows, and believes that nobody knows.
<Om> WindWhistler: Would you still pet it :3
<FairysHuff> DeathStar: Oh it'll be months maybe even years before the doctors get around to deciding if i need surgery or not

<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Why not go into weapons dealing? I hear it's profitable.
<Ninjazz> Yes. No this... I a weapon.
<SolairePony89> Sylandest: No interview yet and I've turned in applications. I live in a really small town, so I doubt they'd need an interview
<Sylandest> SolairePony89: you'd be surprised. Consider calling them back to ask if they've read your application. It shows how serious you are about getting the job

<Shizuka> 13liiiiiike
<Shizuka> 13vi x me?
<Sumica> 00,10ahhh but I was hopeing for somthing much like that
<Ponies47> Night Dr_Fumbles :)
<CriticKitten> I dunno about the idea, it could work. I have to snort at the notion that it somehow proves Blizzard is dead and gone, though, since Blizzard already put one of their games onto a Nintendo console in the past. I'd note that it's true Blizzard is dead, but this is most certainly NOT a reason why
<Sylandest> Shizuka: oh mai~
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: *drools*
<CriticKitten> Vi x Shizu would be too saucy for our viewers, Shizu
<MahBoi777> Dr. Fumbles.....where have I heard that before :/
<Sumica> 00,10I like shizus idea
<Ninjazz> Indeed. The old Blizz is dead.
<Sylandest> Sumica: who doesnt? XD
*Ninjazz misses it so
<Rain> as do I :3c
<xxMoopyxx> Hey i bought this cool lookin bottle rocket for rainbow dash so this is only for her
<Dken2021> CriticKitten what's the harm of putting an MMO on a console?
<Sumica> 00,10MahBoi777, robot chicken
<Irish_Pony> ew
<CriticKitten> Dken2021: There isn't any.
<MahBoi777> oh that's right! thanks Sumica
<Irish_Pony> I hate that show :P
<Ninjazz> MahBoi777, bad ass sniper dude.
<SolairePony89> CriticKitten: I see this as a good thing. More people get to experience a good game
<CriticKitten> Dken2021: Though the control scheme is likely going to suck for that.
<MahBoi777> right right now I remember
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy shoots off a bottle rocket for rainbow dash*
<Ponies47> I have never seen Robot Chicken :$
<CriticKitten> SoliarePony89: I think if they get the interface to work, it could be awesome, actually
<xxMoopyxx> yeeeeaaahhh whoooooo!
<Irish_Pony> and Wrek is moving on to a completley different picture, lets see what it is...*watches the stream closely*
<CriticKitten> Starcraft 64 had a somewhat "meh" interface, so did C&C 64.
<Dken2021> CriticKitten I suppose that, but with that touchpad, could be an intersting control scheme
<FairysHuff> I burned myself out on WoW years ago. Can't face any MMOs anymore. So much time wasted
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: 10 bits says its a pony XD
<SolairePony89> CriticKitten: If the Wii U gets any Total War game I might just have to pick up a Wii U at some point
<CriticKitten> Dken2021: For SC2? It'd be interesting.
<Ponies47> So how was Toy Story 2? :)
*DeathStar dose not apresiate this cover
<CriticKitten> I imagine that it'll be difficult to implement though, and hard to run the game through the same Battle.net networks on the Wii U unless the internet capabilities are up to snuff
<Irish_Pony> Oh wow... my friend just gave me an update on a picture he's drawing for me and it just...wow....
<FairysHuff> Well I'm gonna try and get a little more sleep. Back in a few hours. Later.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Irish_Pony: can we see it?
<Sylandest> laters, FairysHuff! :)
<Irish_Pony> http://i.imgur.com/ugXpH.jpg
<Ponies47> Night night again FairysHuff :)
<SolairePony89> CriticKitten: Forgot about all that crap. If only Blizzard could go without the Battle.net networks for the Wii U version, but we all know that isn't gonna hapen
<MahBoi777> bye FairysHuff! take care:)
<xxMoopyxx> Hey i know who that pony is
<SolairePony89> Cya till then FairysHuff
<SolairePony89> Soarin?
<Rain> dat badass looking pony. I bet it is Wrek just going outside on a normal day
<xxMoopyxx> is it docter whooves?
<MahBoi777> lol
<Irish_Pony> Kinda looks like the guy from Alone in the Dark :P
<drf_Droid> FFS
<CriticKitten> SoliarePony89: I'd rather run through Battle.net than Nintendo's facade of an internet network for the Wii.
<Shamroc> Wrek: somthing is making me thing like your trying to do another indepth sniper pony

<sub06905> enjoy dat shower :3
<BroKnee> Ponies47 How are you today? :)
<Ponies47> BroKnee: Fine thank you :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So are my gaming rants nothing but entertainment?
<Ponies47> sub06905: YES :3
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: maybe....
<CECtheRonin> CriticKitten Spoony, as far as I know, hasn't gone as far as to be ousted by his hosts (though his fans are another story). Also, unlike Moviebob, Spoony has legitimate talent.
<sub06905> i guess so Nittany_Discord :D
<CriticKitten> They are entertaining.
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: There fun to watch. :P
<SolairePony89> Nittany_Discord: They aren't only entertainment, but they are entertaining
<CriticKitten> But to be fair, you're not saying anything I didn't already know. :P
<sub06905> Nittany care to go on a rant right now?
<SolairePony89> ^ Pretty much yeah
<CriticKitten> CEC: He was recently suspended from TGWTG for a month.
<Ponies47> Trust me being banned isn't fun :'(
<CECtheRonin> CriticKitten Whaaaaaa? What did he do?
<CriticKitten> Due to a Twitter faux pas, IIRC.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. They won't make any difference.
<SolairePony89> Ponies47: What have you been banned from?
<sub06905> is scootaloo the only one with her own website?
<CECtheRonin> CriticKitten What exactly did he say? He can get pretty pigheaded on twitter, so I can't imagine what he could have possibly said.
<Ponies47> SolairePony89: I kind of gave a link to a fanfic that must never be named agian. :$
<Ponies47> Chat got quiet. :(
<MahBoi777> NOPE
<Ponies47> Was it somthing I said? :(
<SolairePony89> Ponies47: Ha. Glad you stayed on the chat though
<CriticKitten> CEC: It was a rape joke, I believe. Which is pretty tasteless, no matter how it's said.
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: it's all your fault!
<Ponies47> SolairePony89: The ban was only for an hour but it felt like foreeeeeever! Of coarse I would stay I wub this chat so much! :)
<Irish_Pony> Wrek: which is your fav. nostialgic critic review?
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Yes it was all my fault for that one time I got banned :$
<CECtheRonin> CriticKitten Ouch. Yeah, that's pretty bad.

<junh1024-XD> durr
<Spy> my brother is
<Sad_Discord> 11,01If you're still streaming, go on.
<Drake> 04oh whoops
<Drake> 04didn't see those
<Vordox> Why sad Dissie?
<MadSurge> Sad_Discord: sorry to bother, but I posted about Bronyfunds on Ponygoons. Thought it might help the cause :(
<Drake> 049. Neither. My family prefers the Kindle, which would technically classify as "Internet" I guess.
<Sad_Discord> 11,01I hope so.
<Drake> 0410. Telephone call. I'm a nervous wreck either way and I'd prefer the caller not see my face.
<Spy> i have MLP mods for my tf2
<Sad_Discord> 11,01There are so many drives going on that I don't think we'll bring in our $2.5k no matter how much attention we get.
<d3rb> how long will the funds be up for Sad_Discord ?
<Drake> 0411. A bit of both really, but mostly me. I'm not certain about the rest of my family in terms of how the internet has affected them.
<Sad_Discord> 11,01Friday.
<d3rb> damn
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<DeadpoolDash> derp derp derp derpy derp
<Phase4> 00,02plus the high profile ones like the humble bundle
<Phase4> 00,02and all the non brony drives
<Meanwhile> I wish I had money to contribute, but unfortunately food doesn't buy itself. :/
<Spy> in the mlp mod for tf2, scout is rainbow dash, and that is VERY odd
<Sad_Discord> 11,01Seeds of Kindness as well.
<Sad_Discord> 11,01They're raking in money.
<d3rb> plus the fact that there are no new eps streams to advertise it
<Irish_Pony> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d4nx1jy
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.keyr.com/ interesting site
<Chrysalis> Phase4 how so?
<Phase4> 00,02its interesting
<Spy> "this is scout, rainbows make me cry" FAIL
<Sad_Discord> 11,01There are a lot of problems that will probably cause us to not hit our goal.
<Chrysalis> Phase4 huh, your right, that is an interesting site
<Chrysalis> Sad_Discord how far off are you?
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: you're*
<Vordox> THis song may help out.

<Vordox> Sad_Discord: It takes Card, or only paypal?
<Phase4> 00,02Sad_Discord, are you watching stream?
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: no one appreciates being corrected, but I will do it until I die anyway.
<Mutterguy> Phase4 current destination?
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, not exploding
<Sad_Discord> 11,01Stream is frozen for me.
<Ascendant> alright thanks
<Phase4> 00,02Sad_Discord, refresh
<SpringStingray> Oh yeah! KSP!
*Spy has a bad day
<Vordox> Sad_Discord: Does it take Credit Card, or Paypal only?
<Meanwhile> Stream was frozen today

<MadSurge> Vordox: I think paypal.

<Ascendant> oh <censored> I forgot to put my demographic/target audience in my intro
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have sworn 33 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!

<Ascendant> Overall she seems pretty happy about it
<Spy> this kind of chat doesnt seem to be made for people like me...i dont think i will ever fit in here
<MadSurge> Vordox: awww :D
<Vordox> Spy: Why you think that?
<SpringStingray> Spy: I feel the same way :p
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, yeah

<Ninjazz> You've only been here for like an hour. Just give it a shot
<Vordox> Yeah
<Ascendant> Anyway Draaaaaaaaake I have my in-class extension english essay tomorrow ._.
<Ascendant> so screwed
<Drake> 04Same
<Vordox> This place is great for just chatting, having some talk about everything
<Drake> 04;~;
<DeadpoolDash> spies fit in everywhere...except where there is fire
<Vordox> While doing other things or enjoying the stream if it peaks your interest
<Ascendant> Emma/Clueless is easier than Disgrace though
<Ascendant> So you should be fine
<Ninjazz> lol
<Ascendant> but 2500 words is overkill
<d3rb> the thing is we all have at least one common intrest, ponies
<BroKnee> Wubwubwub ^-^
<Vordox> Sad Phase = Best pony XD
<Irish_Pony> btw Meanwhile you ever heard of Mount and Musket?
<Ascendant> hurr
<d3rb> Vordox: did you make that oc for phase?
<omnipony> And we all love our wub's :)
<Spy> my grandpha was driver of a fire engine
<Ascendant> But yeah Drake, the assignment/project that interview was for
<Ascendant> is due on friday
<Ascendant> needs to be 2000-ish words
<Vordox> d3rb: Just the sitting thing there when he blinks
<Ascendant> not including bibliography and appendix
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: No. I have not.
<Vordox> The others was made by someone else
<Ascendant> intro is 500, main body is 1000, conclusion is 500
<Ascendant> I have my intro done
<d3rb> thats the best part :D
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04blargh
<Ascendant> And I wrote my questionnaire + interview in about half an hour
<Vordox> If you check the Bronystate Website he's looking at, when he goes to fire his rocket, you see the Colours jumo
<Ascendant> I just need to format the questionnaire
<Vordox> The colours become stark contrast
<Ascendant> then print it
<Vordox> Guess that spriter didn't use the same technique I did ><
<Ascendant> I started it today
<Vordox> See?
<Spy> how did everything about Derpy Hooves actualy start?
<Vordox> Spy: Football Mothers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Damn stream derps.
<Vordox> Or you mean how she was to become who she was?
<d3rb> i think /b/ trolls personaly
<omnipony> It started when someone spotted derpy in the background on the first episode.
<trollhunter> derpy hooves wasjust the animaters fucking around
<Spy> no, i mean "Derpy" does sound like something from a fad
<SpringStingray> Derpy is the fan name
<Meanwhile> lol
<Vordox> Derpy is from the word "Derp" meaning "Doh" or "duh"
<Meanwhile> Asplode.
<SpringStingray> Woops
<Invi> :D
<Spectrum_Rush> well they lived atleast
<LightTrooper105> lulz
<d3rb> derp may or may not have been started by the creators of south park
<Mutterguy> Phase4 I worry that the fuel seems to be very attached to the Shuttlecraft
<Vordox> Which was created back in 1996 and became first known through a movie with Matt Stone
<SpringStingray> Forgot to add an actual spaceship
<Mutterguy> 8fueltank
<BroKnee> Can anypony link me something awesome to keep me distacted for a couple of hourse?
<BroKnee> hours*
<MadSurge> COLLAPSED, AND THEY LIVED :D
<Spy> but...all the save derpy things then?
<d3rb> baseketball....why has that not been shown here?
<Vordox> Now travel forth int ime to the first episode, or was it second, where a 4Chan member saw the cross eye, and the rest is history
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: Well...theres this game that takes place during the times of Neapolic Wars, and theres this regiment that chooses there commanders in a rather interesting way...
<omnipony> they are immortal :o
<Spectrum_Rush> Vordox: spy means derpygate
<Irish_Pony> XD
<SpringStingray> Haha
<d3rb> :D bahahaha]
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Mutterguy> no the Cabin is built like a bombshelter
<SpringStingray> Woops again
<Vordox> Spy: Save derpy was due to Derpy being censored, due to how she was potrayed as a "mental disability" which is utter bullshit.
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: And that way is...?
<Irish_Pony> THEY LIVE!
<Spectrum_Rush> how
<Invi> pretty tough guys there Phase4 ^^
<omnipony> again they live
*Spy is getting cunfused
<Mutterguy> LIKE A BOMB SHELTER!
<Phase4> 00,02Invi, ikr
<Vordox> Spy: Ah, I'll make it short
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: they choose who has the best moustache :)
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: I win.
<d3rb> spy http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Derpy
<d3rb> this should answer most questions
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: How do you know I win? hhhhhhhmmmmmm?
<Vordox> Spy: Derpy first appearance, as a talkable Background character,. She was potrayed, according to the people who did not like how she was seen, as a Pony with mental disability, in other words a Retard.
<Vordox> This caused a few people to take offense(in a cartoon, wtf?), and complained
<Vordox> The Hasbro got quite a few people on their tail who wished to censor her.
<BroKnee> Vordox Also it was an animation error, nothing to complain over
<Spy> oh...i see
<Vordox> BroKnee: I'm talking about Derpygate
<SpringStingray> The Derpy fiasco was kind of our fault
<BroKnee> Vordox Ohh, What is that? xD
<SpringStingray> Because we named her as such
<classikcolt> hi everypony!
<Jim> hi classikcolt
<classikcolt> C:
<Vordox> Spy: After that, they removed the episode for 1 whole month, which caused an uproar as Bronies was forming theories about "DERPY IS GOING TO BE REMOVED",, Hasbro never let out any information which cased the avalancche of worries tip over.
<BroKnee> Hello classikcolt ^-^
<d3rb> i think if the voice actor had done her voice as a female originally it wouldnt have gone as bad as it did
<omnipony> Yeah and we portrayed her in that way but not being offensive.. i think?
<Vordox> Spy: And once the Episode was rereleased, she was changed, INCOMING BRONY SUFFER

<Phase4> 00,02i'm not sure what happened there
<Dumori> not my own though
<Spy> lol
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: I dont think it was studry enough so it must have broke off
<Dumori> though with some work adding a decupling lander to it
<Phase4> 00,02it detached
<Dumori> it can make a return trip to mun or maybe min for sure
<ofna01> YES

<HiImSpike> that look better than befor
<Irish_Pony> well the crew seems calm :D
<HiImSpike> Irish_Pony: they go happy if the plane capsizes
<ofna01> Phase4: i made it to orbit one liquid fuel rocket and one solid
<Spy> cmon! you can do it!
<Mutterguy> Dumori, have you had universal sandbox? It would go well with kerbal. You explore the solar system yo just built
<HiImSpike> Phase4: are you trying to make it to the moon or orbit around celestia

*Vordox is listening to Nier soundtrack, bawling loudly with headphones on at the corner of the room, tears gushing out and sniffing.
<Irish_Pony> o_o
<omnipony> seems legit
<Majestic_Sparkler> anypony got sc2? or am i the only one

<Vordox> Nier was the reason I decide to say "FUCK YOU IGN AND GAMESPOT; you PIECE OF CRAP CAN'T REVIEW WHAT GAMES ARE" and I never looked at those two ever again.
<HiImSpike> omnipony: I with you on that
<Vordox> BUCKING AHOLES WHO CANNOT DO ANYTHING RIGHT ON REVIEWING
*Ninjazz nods

*ofna01 hugs Vordox
<HiImSpike> Phase4: thats the plan
<omnipony> Phase4: well i cant wait
<Majestic_Sparkler> i agree they might as well get money under the table for saying that a game is good
<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: Hi you :)
<Spy> im playing this myself, i have no engines and i keep climbing though
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sup!
<diddutz> it clearly needs more glitter
<ofna01> Scoot
<ofna01> TF2?
<Vordox> Ninjazz: I was looking at Nier in the store, and the person who was at the counter just smiled and say, "buy it" but I decided not to, after watching some reviews online, and it looked boring.
<Phase4> 00,02OH LORD
<Phase4> 00,02IT DIDNT BOOM
<ofna01> WA
<HiImSpike> yay
<ofna01> HOW
<Vordox> But...my eyes was always drawn at it, even if I had the expectations of a bad game, my hunch told me to buy it.
<Vordox> BESt
<Mutterguy> Phase4 that amount of bolt I demand you need to ad to make this atay to gether is astronomival
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I see a stack of rockets on stream.
<diddutz> Phase4: for us that was a sopiler ...
<Vordox> GAME OF 2010! NO, THE ERA OF PLAYSTATION
<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: not much, just been in love since midnight :)
*Ninjazz now needs to go find himself a copy and a working PS3
<Vordox> Why must the BEST games ALWAYS get bad reviews....
<RustyMeat> What game is this anyway?

<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: Bunny_Maid_Luna <3
<HiImSpike> KIA
<ofna01> sonic rainboom
<Majestic_Sparkler> haha
<Ninjazz> Vordox, I'm not even sure anyone else has it.

<Irish_Pony> XD
<Vordox> Ninjazz: It's the whole stuff again... The whole thing about it...
<omnipony> OMG!~!!!!!!!!
<ofna01> HOLY SHIT
*|Discord| hugs Jim
<Meanwhile> Mother of god
<HiImSpike> obviesly needs more POWA
<Jim> And that's how equestira was made
<Irish_Pony> XXDDDDDDDDDDDD
<diddutz> that thing needs SOLIDS FOR TAKEOFF!
<Majestic_Sparkler> NUCLEAR LAUNCH
<ofna01> its a Super Nova
<Spy> O_O_O_OO__O_O_O_O
<twilight_sprinkle> rocket-lag-no rocket
<somepony_else> more rockets!
<Irish_Pony> :D:D:D:D
<Majestic_Sparkler> MOOOORE
<omnipony> Wasn't good enough more rockets.
<HiImSpike> :D
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Scoot-Scootaloo
<killerpony7733> This rocket needs to be 20% cooler
*Scoot-Scootaloo is dusted~
<Vordox> Ninjazz: One of the best games ever made, made by people at the brink of bankrupt, where they put their entire soul in the game, and then...CAUSE OF BAD F*CKING REVIEWING, they lost the will of their Soul of their company, and went bankrupt,...It was like Final Fantasy 1... Without success DUE TO REVIEWERS...
<Meanwhile> Needs to be about 20% more rocket.
<Vordox> AAAAAAAARGH!
<twilight_sprinkle> needs 20% more GLITTER
*Vordox kicks self
<HiImSpike> insufficent... Green people
<Ninjazz> ...
<ofna01> lol
<Meanwhile> What're you talking about Vordox?
<omnipony> We need more rockets if we want to get to luna
<ofna01> he has to hold the engines together
<Chrysalis> insufficient green splatters over the runway
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Nier
<ofna01> NEEDS MOAR DUCT TAPE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What game is this Vordox?
<Vordox> A game for Playstation 3, that was the best game of the era on it's storytelling
<Meanwhile> Oh, that all?
<HiImSpike> instead of rocket fuel needs AppleJack Daniels
<Vordox> And it got under the radar due to heavy influence of IGN and Gamespot mostly.
<omnipony> lol
<LightTrooper105> again im back and.... so many rocket o.o
<Majestic_Sparkler> :O
<omnipony> Cue rocket music
<ofna01> 2fps
<Jim> it didn't explode :o
<Majestic_Sparkler> :I
<ofna01> no problem
<Vordox> Meanwhile: If you see a Classic well built game, with diversity of being the best story written, IT EVEN COMPARES TO SHAKESPEAR, being ignored, would you not be angry?
<Phase4> 00,02its lagging too much
<LightTrooper105> will it fly or will it fall..
<Majestic_Sparkler> aww
<Spy> bye
<Vordox> Ever since then, I decided to focus on my hunch feeling, and let me tell you, it hasn't failed yet.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What game?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Too much rockets?
<Spectrum_Rush> bai Spy
<Meanwhile> Vordox: I think it's a bit of a leap to compare Nier to Shakespeare.
<Majestic_Sparkler> sadface
<Vordox> Meanwhile: It's not...
<omnipony> too lttle rockts
<Phase4> 00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, NOT ENOUGH ROCKET
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nvm.
<killerpony7733> Vordox reviewers are generally very bad since they can easily be bribed by huge AAA title publishers for reviews and more or less not keep a neutral review, They always ruin their credibility by showing its obvious the review isn't neutral like saying its flaws and it's up sides
<twilight_sprinkle> only one solution....more rockets
<omnipony> rockets*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:O
<Vordox> killerpony7733: I know that!
<HiImSpike> MORE ROCKETS
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Heck, SHAKESPEAR WOULD BE PROUD to read it.
<LightTrooper105> Phase4 why not use Truster?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03How the...?
<Spectrum_Rush> wa
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's too heavy.
<HiImSpike> died in style
<Majestic_Sparkler> Your computer is dead
<Vordox> Meanwhile: He loved the whole one side of a story telling with putting in other views and differences within the same perspective
<omnipony> I think with more rockets we can pass luna xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The rockets are breaking under the weight.
<Vordox> WHICH NIER Does! And it does it fluently, and it feels within reason.
<Majestic_Sparkler> That sound xD
<omnipony> OMG
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You needed more rockets ._.
<Majestic_Sparkler> Hahaha
<Mutterguy> He needs a far more pwerful rocket engine
<twilight_sprinkle> rocket->lag->no rocket
<LightTrooper105> lololol
<Jim> bang
<Meanwhile> Kabooooooooooooooooooom
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dead!
<killerpony7733> Vordox: They need to be neutral, else you can't review something
<ofna01> im pretty sure their dead
<HiImSpike> RIP headphone users
<omnipony> best fireworks ever!
<LightTrooper105> i prefer more truster
<Majestic_Sparkler> best explowsion ever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fixed the lag.
<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: tell me, how embarrassing would it be for my OC to be in a bunny outfit?
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Sad truth... As I said, never trust reviewers again
<Phase4> 00,02it cant lift itself XD
<LightTrooper105> Phase4 time to spam those truster
<ofna01> Phase
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It would be adorable, Irish_Pony :3
<ofna01> TF2 anyone?
<Vordox> Phase4: Build the Tanks and engines AROUND the shuttle? :P
<twilight_sprinkle> ramp up those thrusters!
<Phase4> 00,02one more attempt then tf2
<Majestic_Sparkler> SC2 anyone?
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01As embarrassing as you in a bunny outfit?
<ofna01> LOL
<HiImSpike> ahahhhaa
<Meanwhile> I find it hilariously unlikely that Nier is as interesting as you seem to think it is Vordox
<Majestic_Sparkler> Epic winn
<ofna01> rocket just fell over
<HiImSpike> LIFE OVER
<Meanwhile> Add more rockets.
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Yep they are very biased douchebahs that think they know soo much about games when they even take bribes for givign a game good score
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Play the game, is all I can say
<omnipony> Rockets all around!
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Don't own a PS3.
<RyunosukeKnT> i like the pony in the corner trying the same thing, with the same results :)
<Vordox> Meanwhile: No, you know what, EMULATE the game if you can
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Tell me when you get to Act 3.
<HiImSpike> thanks omnipony for the rocket
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: ya thanks for the support im just gonna have my OC put on a bunny oufit for my love =_=

<Vordox> Lil_B: If you get the change, PLAY the game!
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: of course :)
<Vordox> chance*
<HiImSpike> Jim: oow was getting afraid for a sec
<Alchemist> are you trying to land or take off? :D
<Meanwhile> Vordox: apparently it's not very interesting to play.
<Lil_B> Vordox Only have a Wii... whats the gameplay like in this game?
<twilight_sprinkle> jellyfish has returned to base
<somepony_else> splash
<killerpony7733> Irish_Pony: http://liokin.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d53nk1x thats Nittany_Discord in a maid outfit
<Spectrum_Rush> look down back up your rockets now a hover craft
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Interesting to play. It has a unique, A HYBRID gameplay
<ofna01> O_O
<HiImSpike> SKILZ
<ofna01> phase is best pilot
<Spectrum_Rush> ... or atleast it was
<ofna01> DED
<ofna01> or not
<Vordox> Meanwhile: It is a Touhou, Zelda, Third Person fighting game with Bullet Hell and Melee dodges
<Irish_Pony> killerpony7733: :D
<HiImSpike> do a barrel roll
<Jim> why did the rest of the rocket disolve in water?
<killerpony7733> Irish_Pony: I daww at it
<omnipony> that was beautiful
<ofna01> Phase4: add me on seam so we can play TF2
<Vordox> Lil_B: The gameplay is unique.
<Vordox> It's been refered to as Touhou Zelda
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01More people can do maid Cold Front.
<Vordox> it doesn't even HAVE a genre name for it's gameplay
<Lil_B> Vordox yes,. I just read, maybe I'll look at a gameplay video later
<Vordox> Lil_B: A second, let me find one where there's a good view of it
<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, steam name?
<Meanwhile> Vordox: it's described as gluey, schizophrenic, repetitive, unchallenging, and supposedly only above average in terms of story.
<Vordox> And really, if you DO play the game whole through, there's 2 MORE endings to it
<Lil_B> Does somebody know "Press play on tape"?
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: cold front?
<ofna01> Phase4: steam name is ofna01
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Where?
<Alchemist> also hi everyone. again :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's my pony OC's name.
<omnipony> to luna we wil go
<Spectrum_Rush> ahh
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Zero Punctuation.
<Alchemist> been here since 6 am, im just studying.
<Vordox> A sec Meanwhile , gonna check it. :P
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord can you give me a reference pic for your OC?
<MegaMoonShine> Hi guys!
<somepony_else> Lil_B: i remember that phrase from my old c64 ^^
<HiImSpike> Hey MegaMoonShine
<Jim> hi MegaMoonShine
<omnipony> hello
<Vordox> "ow didn't see this cominga action JRPG and Yahtzee actually kinda liked it.I really wanna check this game out it looks fun to me at least."
<Lil_B> somepony_else yes, and there is a Band that plays old C64 Tunes colled "Press Play on Tape" I kinda like their music :)
<Jim> Fetching results...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/803/h51gz.jpg/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oopa
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oops
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Yahtzee ENJOYED the game. :P
<Vordox> It got PRAISE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg803/scaled.php?server=803&filename=h51gz.jpg&res=landing
<Vordox> How often does that happen?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Takes you to the same image.
<omnipony> Star rocket :D
<HiImSpike> <3
<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: btw this is the lucky lass ;) http://majorxshadow.deviantart.com/#/d526dih
<MegaMoonShine> Well, this rocket design looks promising
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: he looks cute. :P
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Very true. Considered competant in some areas and severely lacking everywhere else.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A friend did that.
<HiImSpike> I see this rocket is gooing to lift off
<Vordox> Meanwhile: If I would review it, the 100% = Best part
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord thanks :D maybe I#ll get around to make a pic of your OC as well :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I chose the colors and designed the cutie mark.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But he did the pic.
<Vordox> 100% Story, 70% Graphics, 85% gameplay,
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Thankfully you won't review it.
<killerpony7733> Lil_B: you got a DA?
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Yeah true
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lil_B: OK.
<Lil_B> killerpony7733 yes
<killerpony7733> Lil_B: link? :)
<Majestic_Sparkler> wow... thats alot more rockets then for a minute ago...
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Thats exactly how I got my OC :D I told her the colors she drawed it :)
<Meanwhile> Really Vordox are you being paid to endorse Nier because the rest of the world seems content to give it a rating of "meh"
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I played the game, ALL of it
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a Larvitar.
<ofna01> Phase4: i thought we were going to play TF2
<Vordox> The full experience of the game is the best in the ERA of PS.
<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, cant find you on steam
<Mutterguy> We shall name it David's Goliath!
<ofna01> ???
<ofna01> really?
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I'll say this to you.
<Phase4> 00,02this is lagging soo bad
<Irish_Pony> God I miss Empire Earth 2 :(
<diddutz> so many struts
<ofna01> Phase4: what do you mean Phase?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I also told him pony type.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He wouldn't do draconequuses, so I had to pick a pony.
<Meanwhile> Vordox: I refuse to believe any games writing is on par with Shakespeare.
<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, i searched for ofna01, no results
<Meanwhile> Especially a JRPG.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: "MLP is for kids, the cartoon graphics doesn't keep up to the quality of today, it's about parties and socializing."
<ofna01> :|
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Need I put in another thing then "Play it yourself"
<Irish_Pony> oh and Scoot-Scootaloo you know tf2 right?
<Majestic_Sparkler> i really enjoyed the mass effect triology sure the ending in mass effect 3 was different but people just didnt understand it at first.
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Meanwhile> Vordox: why.
<d3rb_cleaning> damn
<pony_2022> omg
<killerpony7733> Majestic_Sparkler: No do not mention it,
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I know TF2, I just don't play it 
<ofna01> Phase4: it wont let me add friends for some reason,how about you give me a TF2 server to join and ill add you from there?
<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: Well... http://monopoly907.deviantart.com/#/d54a0mk
<Spectrum_Rush> that reminds me Phase4 you didnt accept my friend request on steam yet
<Majestic_Sparkler> :) haters gonna hate
<HiImSpike> ooooooooooow Phase4 all that work and still the same result...
<diddutz> wow, that seems like a new recort, crash in just 3 frames O.o
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Why I recommend the game, for the game experience in it's fullness.
<d3rb_cleaning> does this beast have any wings or flaps?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03lol!
<Invi> Phase4 it needs boosters. more boosters :D
<Vordox> Meanwhile: The story and music makes the game high above the bar compared to...well...any game
<Majestic_Sparkler> that noise. ..
<killerpony7733> Majestic_Sparkler: hardly the phrase you should use the ending was a massive middle finger to the fans
<Mutterguy> it's flying....
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: apperently Im purple in your chat :<
<Jim> ded?
<Phase4> 00,02Irish_Pony, indeed
<Mutterguy> control system?
<Phase4> 00,02Invi, hmmm
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: I hate purple :|
<Majestic_Sparkler> meh i enjoyed it
<Invi> and landing gears:D
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, whats that?
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, is it a new kind of rocket?
<Jim> purple is cool
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Uhhuh, if it's all the same to you I'll be saving my money to try things that aren't described by the majority as "boring"
<Jim> purple is best pony
<Mutterguy> no just the SAS
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Fun fact
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Too heavy.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Fuck Majority
<Meanwhile> That's not a fact.
<ofna01> Phase4: i have an idea
<MegaMoonShine> It actuallly took off! Wooooo!
<Majestic_Sparkler> Majority sucks :)
<ofna01> Phase4: do you have Kammer on your friends list?
<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, think so
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nvm.
<Phase4> 00,02a few rockets got left behind
<Meanwhile> Majestic_Sparkler: Because you're a completely special unique little soul.
<ofna01> Phase4: add me from his friends list
<Majestic_Sparkler> Is it working?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some of the engines broke off.
<Majestic_Sparkler> yay :D
<Meanwhile> Majestic_Sparkler: Sarcasm.jpg
<ofna01> i declare this a success!
<HiImSpike> I think soo
<killerpony7733> Majestic_Sparkler: You may have but i played all of the series and it just ends it in the worst way ever done no closure no sense of finally succeeding you just get the worst explanation of who the reapers are and why do what they do, But seriously i don't want to discuss a game that made me stop with the series
<Phase4> 00,02i have a slight ammount of controll over this thing
<Meanwhile> Oh wow it didn't explode in 2 seconds?
<Phase4> 00,02in theory i could make it to mun
<Chrysalis> Phase4 holy cow thats ALOT of rockets
<omnipony> WERE COMING AGAIN LUNA!!
<MegaMoonShine> The framerate improved aswell
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Add some RCS to help with control.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RCS thrusters.
<MegaMoonShine> We've broken free from the lagg!
<Lil_B> Phase4 is theorethicly possible, but practiply undoable
<Mutterguy> you just need to get it out of the atmosphere and you'll be fine
<Phase4> 00,02i unno
<omnipony> is it starting to tilt?
<Phase4> 00,02if i switch to the rockets with thrust vectoring
<Majestic_Sparkler> i've played all of them aswell and yes the ending wasnt what i had expected but i didnt dislike it.
<ofna01> some rockets are about to run out
<ofna01> that might be bad
<Majestic_Sparkler> Why is that thing even working lOL
<Meanwhile> The ending of ME3 made me hate it the more I thought about it.
<Chrysalis> ofna01 hes already had a set of tanks empty
<killerpony7733> Majestic_Sparkler: For the sake of a never ending arguement lets not talk about it please
<Phase4> 00,02allso i have no staging or parachute
<Majestic_Sparkler> True!
<MegaMoonShine> It's tilting pretty bad!
<Phase4> 00,02i was actualy relying on the rockets exploding off
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Majority
<Phase4> 00,02i'm tilting it :P
<Spectrum_Rush> gentlemen this is our goal http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/152/c/5/luna_and_space_core__colored__by_frankier77-d3hu0j4.jpg
<Meanwhile> Suddenly underwhelming in-the-dark macguffin ending.
<omnipony> Oh god.... its tilting
<HiImSpike> dont missclick and ejects any premature rocket pods
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) *yawns* how are we all today?
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Mentioning the majority doesn't really impact anything.
<Chrysalis> man them engines are gonna pop soon
<omnipony> Specteum_Rush: Yes. yes it is :D
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Really? It forced Bioware themselves
<Majestic_Sparkler> morning sylandest
<HiImSpike> good thanks and how are you Sylandest
<MegaMoonShine> Hi Sylandest! It is afternoon for me! :)
<killerpony7733> dat spin
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: show Mun so omnipony can see the one that made it to it
*Sylandest waves at Majestic_Sparkler, HiImSpike, MegaMoonShine :)
<Meanwhile> Vordox: It forced Bioware to make a shitty ending?
<MegaMoonShine> That noise is killing my ears!
<omnipony> lol I believe it already
<Lil_B> oh hi Sylandest ;)
<killerpony7733> Vordox: EA more or less helped in the downfall TBH
<Chrysalis> and out of fuel
<Sylandest> I see we're having more fun with rockets today, hehe. Is this a new attempt?
<Sylandest> Howdy, Lil_B! :)
<Chrysalis> oh wow another set of tanks lol
<Phase4> 00,02still have a few tanks left
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Shitty ending?
<Meanwhile> Hey develop your character and make all these choices but yo it doesn't matter anyway because magic space lasers.
<Vordox> Phase4: What have you created...?
<MegaMoonShine> I think you scared the living shit out of the passengers Phase :D
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, i have no clue D:
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Aaaand this is HOW farfetched witht the whole WORLD ENDING STUFF?
<omnipony> uh oh
<Sylandest> MegaMoonShine: oh, he does that every time...they're pansies...:D
<Phase4> 00,02omnipony, it'll get there in a minute
<Phase4> 00,02theres a rocket called tri landed on mun
<omnipony> lol awesome
<Phase4> 00,02and by rocket i meen the command module
<Phase4> 00,02rocket exploded on impact
<Majestic_Sparkler> Luna!
<omnipony> oh wow thats awesome
<Vordox> Phase4: How much fuel do you have left?
<Mutterguy> I suggested we name it David's Goliath!
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, i think 2 tanks per rocket
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: all becuse of that lieing altimeter
<MadSurge> Hey Meanwhile! Pissed at Mass Effect? :D
<Phase4> 00,02OH LOL
<HiImSpike> MadSurge: ???
<Phase4> 00,02only the outside rockets work
<Chrysalis> MadSurge who isnt pissed at the me ending
<Phase4> 00,02the inner ones have no fuel
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: yup
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Are you somehow implying that pulling that kind of convoluted bollocks without any real explanation is passable because of the scenario?
*Sylandest coughs at Ninjazz and CrazyCherry :D
<HiImSpike> owwwwwww yeah crappy ending MadSurge
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Luna! We're COMING!!
<Ninjazz> Bless you, Sylandest.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Yes?
<Chrysalis> Phase4 good luck movin with all that dead weight :P
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: Oh hiya Sylly!!!
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: cough*starchild*cough
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Then your credibility is gone in it's entirety.
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: no attack hugs this morning? :(
<Phase4> 00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, all i could do is mabey impact with it, nothing i can do to land
<Vordox> Meanwhile: The whole scenario is based on fantasy, so why cannot you appreciate the idea of anything else that's fantasy?
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: howdy, cherry! :)
<CrazyCherry> BRB
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: never played that series, and I think too that that ending was bullshit. :D
<Phase4> 00,02i love al the bits of space junk i've left around
<omnipony> We can deliver the pizza!! This time tossnit out the window before we crash
<Lil_B|afk> nick-check
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So that means you're going to.... bomb the moon? D:
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I'm not saying anything about WHY it's bad, it's still possible with the fantasy, it should be able to be used, AND being validated.
<Lil_B|afk> worked :)
<Chrysalis> Phase4 are you about to bomb the mum
<Chrysalis> mun*
<Ninjazz> Sylandest, sorry. Busy getting this damned iPod full of songs before I head off for a flight in... *looks at clock* 3 houra.
<CrazyCherry> Back.
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, wrong orbit
<Mutterguy> No West, Kerbalia
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: ahhhh, i see! Carry on then, hehe. No worries :)
<Phase4> 00,02cant possibly transfer to mun
<Lil_B|afk> Ninjazz oh hi :) where are you going?
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: welcome back :)
<Phase4> 00,02so bom kerbim it is
*Ninjazz hugs Sylandest
<Meanwhile> Vordox: The magic star child who was never even hinted at appeared, caused our death, and left the end largely oblivious. There was no exposition, it just chopped our heads off and then gave us the credit screen.
<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: the moon is infected with zombies we must destory it :(
*Sylandest hugs Ninjazz back :D
<Ninjazz> Lil_B|afk, to the states. and hello. :)
<Kammerjunk> Nos coniungamus! Sit luna oriatur!
<Ninjazz> Whoa... Meanwhile also makes text walls too.
<Lil_B|afk> Ninjazz how long until we see you again?
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Isn't that a person dying the same thing?
<Mutterguy> He's made a Kamikaze orbital MOAB
<Majestic_Sparkler> i want to go to a brony meetuo :(
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: and the god damn vague explanation of how he leads the reapers and everything is just grade A bad writing
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Also the star child is the same appearance as the child who died in mid game
<Irish_Pony> Oh CrazyCherry hi :)
<Meanwhile> Vordox: It's bad because it's a macguffin, and it's bad because it renders all decisions up to that point meaningless, which in a game as into moral choice as Mass Effect is a real kick in the junk.
<Ninjazz> Lil_B|afk, hopefully I'll still be around as long as I have an internet connection. But I'll be back in a couple months.
<CrazyCherry> Irish_Pony: I WAS HERE ALL THE TIME!!
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: where are you going? :)
<Irish_Pony> CrazyCherry: o_o
<Majestic_Sparkler> IF you hate the mass effect 3 ending ... Read this http://uninhibitedandunrepentant.tumblr.com/post/19344938387/mind-holy-fuck
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: aye, she has been here a wee while...XD
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I'm talking about the STORY
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Eeyup. After they promised that Mass Effect 3 would allow for a lot different choices, and that these choices would effect the ending.
<Phase4> 00,02THIS THING IS IN ORBIT
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Not how it was executed.
<Meanwhile> Majestic_Sparkler: Is that the indoctrination theory.
<Lil_B|afk> Ninjazz well, i hope that you have lots of interntes there :)
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, to the states. All over most of the west half and the middle of it.
<Majestic_Sparkler> yes
<omnipony> haha we did it
<Meanwhile> Vordox: The story ends on a cliffhanger. That's a kick in the balls as well.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I ADMIT ti's a sucky ending, but it's a VALID ending, it COULD happen within the fantasy of ME3
<Ninjazz> Lil_B|afk, If I can help it, I will. ^-^
<Mutterguy> Woot! you now have a Fueltank in space
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: oooh, have fun!
<Vordox> Meanwhile: If you would die, would you live to see what happens after?
<Vordox> Meanwhile: You're playing a persona of Shepherd.
<Ninjazz> I'll try. ^-^;
<Spectrum_Rush> ima miss you Ninjazz :'(
<Meanwhile> Vordox: I want to see what happens after.
<Majestic_Sparkler> I wanna make a shepard pony
*Ninjazz hugs Spectrum_Rush "I'll try to be around. Don't worry."
<Meanwhile> Vordox: I want to know what happened to the people, the places, that's a really fuckign shitty excuse.
<killerpony7733> Majestic_Sparkler: Obviously biased, and someone who can't simply try to atleast see whats wrong
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Well Sheperd is gone.
<ofna01> i am pony shepherd,and this is my favorite cider on the citadel
*Spectrum_Rush snifff
<ofna01> :)
*Spectrum_Rush hugs Ninjazz
<Mutterguy> Phase4, Roughly, how empty is it?
<Meanwhile> Vordox: You're trolling me aren't you.
<Phase4> 00,02i have enough to fall to kerbin, thats about it
<HiImSpike> Kammerjunk: tooo all that has not played the game spoilers... I found tha the ending nearly started a massive fight due the crappy 3 color ending
<Vordox> Meanwhile: No I'm not.
<Majestic_Sparkler> anyone got SC2?
<Meanwhile> Vordox: yeah you are.
<Majestic_Sparkler> noone ...
<ofna01> Phase4: lets play TF2
<Meanwhile> No one could look at that argument and think "yup, seems legit."
<HiImSpike> Majestic_Sparkler: I doo :)
<killerpony7733> ofna01: I'm commander pony shephard and this is my favorite stream on bronystate
<Majestic_Sparkler> YAY!
<Vordox> Meanwhile: No, Story Wise, it SHOULD end when you die, if you're palaying a certain person
<Meanwhile> Vordox: That's fucking stupid.
<Kammerjunk> HiImSpike: It would have been less terrible in my opinion if they didn't previously promise a bigger impact of your choices.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: And you've been playing the same char for over 3 games.
<Phase4> 00,02make it fall to kerbin and explode or leave them in orbit forever?
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: You still see that guy telling about "the Shepard".
<omnipony> fall to kerbin!
<Princess_Molestia> Hello everypony
<MegaMoonShine> Phase4: Make it fall
<Phase4> 00,02fall to kerbin it is
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: That's just load of bull :P I agree
<MadSurge> Hey CrazyCherry, didn't notice you :)
<Mutterguy> either fate means a horrible death
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Yeah, I have, and I've gotten to know the universe over 3 games. I've met people over 3 games, I've decided the fate of species over 3 games. I want to know what happens to them.
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Princess_Molestia
<Meanwhile> Allo Princess_Molestia.
<Majestic_Sparkler> Molestia ... why did i even read that.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: If they show things after your dath, it's bonusthings
<Vordox> Meanwhile: And that's where some issues comes up
<HiImSpike> Kammerjunk: was the bit when the ghostly kids showed up
<Meanwhile> Vordox: You who compares Nier to Shakespeare have no right to talk about how stories work.
<Kammerjunk> HiImSpike: What about it?
<Vordox> Meanwhile: It's been so upheaved within gaming, people feel that they got too used seein Resolutions from loose ends in game.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: If Nier head person adies, it's over.
<ofna01> Kamme
<Vordox> Meanwhile: And I mean OVER
<ofna01> do you have Phase on your friends list Kammer?
<ofna01> on steam
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Look at the old books of Shakespear, how do they end, how do they interpret it with words.
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Well, that sounds impeccably dull.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Yet, they did it in such a way, that it felt like a resolution
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: I do not.
<Majestic_Sparkler> I wanna play sc2 in pony style :(
<Vordox> Not a macguffin as you say
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: when did you end Mass Effect 3?
<ofna01> :(
<HiImSpike> Kammerjunk: He was never mentioned and the choices had everyone uproared at my school
<Meanwhile> Vordox: that's different, that's reading, this is interactive character developement. This isn't reading the story of Commander Shepard, this is being Command Shepard.
*Irish_Pony hugs CrazyCherry
<Kammerjunk> HiImSpike: ...Choices?
<Vordox> Meanwhile: It's what you do at the end before you die that's important, not the things after your death. Look at other games like "Lone person dies but noone ever knows" game stories.
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Phase4> 00,02i slowed it to zero
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: That's subjective, though.
<Phase4> 00,02its orbit is down
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: True.
<MegaMoonShine> Oh my god!
<Vordox> Meanwhile: It's different, but it's story telling, You still have to follow the rules of the game, storywise, I THINK the laser ARE fine, sure it SUCKED but it was a choice.
<Kammerjunk> I mean, I started playing ME like a week before ME3 was released, so I wasn't as hyped as everyone else, nor as disappointed.
<omnipony> time to play free fallin by tom petty xD
<Meanwhile> Vordox: This is a story, a story that doesn't have a proper ending. I want my ending.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Trust me, I HATE ME3 ending too
<Vordox> Meanwhile: The end was that you sacrificed yourself to end the reapers assault.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: And you saw what happened to your crew.
<killerpony7733> Vordox remember what bioware promised?
<HiImSpike> Meanwhile: true
<Spectrum_Rush> ofna01: ... are you a red vs blue fan?
<Majestic_Sparkler> Yay now my friend who thinks im insane for worshipping ponies online. Time to screw with her head.
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Yes, ending that was different depending on how you played the game
<Sylandest> and now, charge towards the planet XD
<Meanwhile> Vordox: You didn't see shit about what happened to the crew. They crashed /somewhere/ and that was it.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Yes, but you ask for MORE?!
<Meanwhile> I want details, I don't care if it's a fucking text epilogue, I want to know what happened.
<HiImSpike> Majestic_Sparkler: Good luck with that
<Majestic_Sparkler> ty
<Meanwhile> Vordox: You're really satisfied with the mediocre aren't you.
<omnipony> Phase4: free fallin would be a great song for this lol
<Majestic_Sparkler> lol
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I'm satified of games if they are good, overal good, yes.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: As I said, I hate the ME3 ending too.
<killerpony7733> Vordox yeah that everyone has a different ending they get for all choices made but yep ME3 that gave you 3 endings blue red green so you picked your poison and thats it no unique ending you got a ending everyone else got with hardly any difference
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Yup, they just crashed somewhere. Even the ones who were with you on the last mission.
<Meanwhile> Vordox: I enjoyed playing the game, which is why the ending is such a dickslap.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Cluffhangers, storywise(Macguffin), the way they ended with the crew and all, and it SURE as hell doesn't feel like the end, but that was the end you got.
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Oh. I got it, so I should be content with it. Is that what you're saying?
<Kammerjunk> Personally, I blame EA more than I blame Ubisoft.
<Mutterguy> So ais the atmosphere gonig to slow it down fast enough?
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, nope
<MegaMoonShine> Mutterguy: Not a chance :D
<HiImSpike> Meanwhile: Yeah me tooo
<Vordox> Meanwhile: 50 hours of gaming versus 10 minutes of ending
<Mutterguy> awesome
<Phase4> 00,02no way to save these guys
<MegaMoonShine> DIVE BOOOOOOOMB!
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile he means you can enjoy most of whats on the plate but hate the last of it
<Sylandest> impending doom inc
<Phase4> 00,02wow
<Majestic_Sparkler> this gonna be good
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NOOOOO :'(
<omnipony> They seem oretty calm about their death
<Phase4> 00,02actualy considering how much it slowed i could have
*MegaMoonShine braces self
<Phase4> 00,02with dificulty
<Mutterguy> no what I mean, will it be too fast to take the terminal velocity into account
<Phase4> 00,02but anyway
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: meaning you praise the game for being good but the ending is not a satisfiying one
<Majestic_Sparkler> if they surive this ...
<omnipony> boom!
<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: They will be remembered :)
<Mutterguy> so it seems it does
<Sylandest> ded
<HiImSpike> woops forgot the parachutes
<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, i'll join a game then send you th eip
<Irish_Pony> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnddddddd
<Meanwhile> Vordox: An ending is the defining moment of a series, one of the prime bits you look back on when you're feeling nostalgic. ME3's ending only works if you get nostalgic over being kicked in the crotch.
<MegaMoonShine> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: More like 150 hours of gaming versus 10 minutes of ending without conclusion.
<ofna01> k Phase
<Irish_Pony> CMON BABY LET ME SEE THE BOOM!
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Defining moments?
<HiImSpike> JIHAD
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Are you kidding me?
<Majestic_Sparkler> compact
<omnipony> ALAH HU AKBAHR
<HiImSpike> coooblamo
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I'd rather have SEVERAL defining moments of a game from start to finish, instead of one great moment at the end
<Spectrum_Rush> ofna01: i found your steam
<HiImSpike> omnipony: hahaha:D
<ofna01> Phase said he cant find mine
<Vordox> Meanwhile: CHeck all classic games that get praised for it, HOW many had MINDBLOWING endings, or the ones that had MIND BLOWING moments over the course of a game?
<killerpony7733> Vordox: it had that but the ending wasn't the full epic conclusion of everything you have accomplished
<omnipony> brb everypony
<Majestic_Sparkler> anypony wanna play SC2?
<Spectrum_Rush> ofna01: hey chicka bum bum
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Expectations does that. ><
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Are you really so ridiculous that you think putting all the effort into getting to the ending only to have it suck is worth it because of the effort part?
<HiImSpike> killerpony7733: didnt they say their will be an update
<CountDoofus> G'day, everybrony.
<Sylandest> howdy, CountDoofus!
<Meanwhile> Allo CountDoofus
<HiImSpike> hey CountDoofus
<Kammerjunk> This entire argument is moot.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I never said it had to suck.
<Meanwhile> Vordox: But in this case it does.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: indeed
<dr-whooves> Hey all you beatifull people
<killerpony7733> HiImSpike: only a extension of the ending still the same ending just with some extra post credit stuff about how some of your choices you made works out
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I, however, say that the end of a game DOESN'T have to be above good.
<CountDoofus> Hai, dr-whooves
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I do not deny it, ME3 ENDING FAILS big time
<Vordox> Meanwhile: But the path to it was indeed great.
<Phase4> 00,02is the stream working?
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Ofc it doesn't have to be above good, it just has to not suck and ME3's fails at that.
<MegaMoonShine> Hey dr-whooves
<dr-whooves> Yes
<CountDoofus> yus Phase
<HiImSpike> killerpony7733: good to know thanks
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02game seems smother
<CountDoofus> Phase4 *
<HiImSpike> hey dr-whooves
<MegaMoonShine> Phase4: Yeah its working
<killerpony7733> HiImSpike: hardly you get same ending only explanation
<Majestic_Sparkler> Have anyone ever tried invading a toy store with 50 people with you. All rushing for the pink section.
<Sylandest> Majestic_Sparkler: cant say I have seen that, no :D
<HiImSpike> Majestic_Sparkler: all the time
<Vordox> Meanwhile: There's mANY things wrong with ME3
<Sylandest> who is yelling? :O
<CountDoofus> Majestic_Sparkler: Yes. The expression of the employees is priceless.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: But it still gets praised...which I find odd in itself.
<Majestic_Sparkler> xD

<Vordox> Meanwhile: Those are personal issues, not game wise
<ofna01> God damn Phase4: how big is this download
<Phase4> 00,02big
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Somehow implying that every issue so far hasn't been a personal one.

<Majestic_Sparkler> how can you shoot at twillight sparkle WHAt is wrong with you!
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I forgot, something about personal and majority being both wrong and both right
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I still recommend Nier, just for the story :P
<CountDoofus> Trying to join TF2 too... downloading :p
<omnipony> What happened to love and tolerance
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Not enough reason to play a game.
<ofna01> same Count
<Meanwhile> omnipony: That's a silly saying.
<ofna01> im almost done downloading
<ofna01> LOL
<omnipony> lol yes it is but its brony code
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Okay, fine, the Story, sidequest, design of the game, Gameplay differences, music
<Meanwhile> omnipony: Only if you're real daft.
<omnipony> ehh i know people that way
<Meanwhile> Vordox: You mean all the stuff that's made everyone else consider it to be slightly above margin?
<ofna01> moar heavys
<Vordox> Meanwhile: There's one downside, if you JUST focus on sidequest, it gets boring, if you focus on the main story, you'll be glued to the couch
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Like every other RPG game
<ofna01> Phase4: it better not be full
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Implying /every/ other RPG is worth playing for story.
<ofna01> Phase4: after all the time i spent downloading
<Batman> hi sky (nickbtw)
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Tales of(Any), FF(any), Fire Emblem(any), Star Ocean(All except 4), Zelda(Any)
<ofna01> god damn
<ofna01> im lagging like a bitch
<Meanwhile> Vordox: FF in that list? For story? You're kidding right.
<Glacymr> omg, it's nick
<Vordox> Meanwhile: FF3, FF5, FF6, FF7, FF9, FF12
<Meanwhile> Mind you, FF isn't worth playing anyway. Loony JRPG emo kids with daft hair abound.
<Phase4> 00,02he's doing what i do
<Glacymr> he's been batman all along
<Spectrum_Rush> hey i think i know that lunacy engineer
<Nick> :D
<Glacymr> how the heck did bruce wayne get suspected of being batman anyway
<Nick> IKR? silly poncy millionaire douche
*Nick runs
<ofna01> Phase4: can we go to a different server?
<Glacymr> so Nick or should i say batman :P
<ofna01> Phase4: im laging like hell on that one
<Glacymr> who do you think would win in a fight
<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, not many other servers that are worth it for me
<Glacymr> you or ironman?
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Saying story is bad in a FF would get you laughed at. :P
<ofna01> Plz?
<Nick> chuck norris
<FlareChaser> Phase4: Would play, but can't.
<Nick> that's always the answer
<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, well unless your in aus theres gona be lag for both of use no matter what
<WindWhistler|Sleep> Vordox: The story is bad
<Glacymr> chuck norris doesn't exist in the marvel or DC universe
<Glacymr> sorry
<ofna01> i mean,im getting maybe 5 fps Phase
<ofna01> its bad
<Meanwhile> Vordox: story in FF is bad. As is gameplay, aesthetics, and just about everything else.
<Nick> but he has to
<Glacymr> no
<Nick> he simply walked into mordor you know?
<Glacymr> he's too broken
<Nick> god Im bored :|
<WindWhistler> Though I do like Crystal Chronicles...it's fun to play
*Nick runs
<Glacymr> o-o
<Vordox> Meanwhile: So you played which of the games to 100%?
*Glacymr gives Nick a dvd copy of the avengers
<Tervicz> test
<WindWhistler> Vordox: You're talking to Meanwhile, your arguement is invalid
<Meanwhile> Vordox: If you try and tell me my opinion is invalid because I decided that I didn't want to continue playing a boring game you literally belong in hell.
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: Not sure if positive or negative.
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: positive
<ofna01> Phase4: ill give you an IP,come play for about 10 minutes,then you can go back to that server
*Meanwhile hugs WindWhistler.
<Nick> :D *takes and watches
<Vordox> Meanwhile: So atleast you tried it good.
<Nick> (never did see it :( )
<Glacymr> better not let anyone hear that
<Meanwhile> Tried, did not enjoy, got rid off.
<Nick> (no one I knew was interested in seeing it and when it came out I was like in the thick of finishing uni work :\)
<omnipony> hi everypony
<Sylandest> howdy, omnipony
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Then story in games are not you rforte. :P Simply
<Glacymr> excuses
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Says you who compares Nier to Shakespeare.
<WindWhistler> Vordox: What you should be saying is that they don't interest him at all.
<Nick> did /you/ see it at the movies?
<Vordox> WindWhistler: Forte, Focus, Enjoyment, etc etc.
<Glacymr> yes
<WindWhistler> oh
<CountDoofus> I have no idea what's going on on that server.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I still do compare Nier to one of the better GAme stories with Tragedy and Black Comedy, yes
<nickelodeonmakesever> is there a video game here insead if my little pony
<Nick> .-.
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile and Vordox to avoid making this a discussion board can you take it to a PM?
<Meanwhile> killerpony7733: you're saying that now?
<Shimmer> Hiya everypony
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: Yes cause i weren't tired of seeing it about 5 minutes ago
<Vordox> killerpony7733: We found our resolution
<nickelodeonmakesever> aren't soccer moms SO stupid?
<Vordox> killerpony7733: We cannot agree since we like games for different reasons
<killerpony7733> Vordox very well then
<WindWhistler> nickelodeonmakesever: Who the heck are you?
<Meanwhile> For example, Vordox likes games that're mediocre in their entirety.
<nickelodeonmakesever> I am nickelodeonmakeseverythingbad
<Meanwhile> Looks more like you're nickelodeonmakesever.
<Vordox> And Meanwhile is one of those people who are under 21and say they enjoy games.
<WindWhistler> nickelodeonmakesever: So you don't like Avatar?
<Meanwhile> Vordox: True, I'm 19.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: I know, it's obvious
<WindWhistler> Vordox: What's that supposed to mean? I'm under 21 and I enjoy games.
<nickelodeonmakesever> i NEVER SAID i DIDN'T
<WindWhistler> :|
<Meanwhile> Oh, it's obvious. So Vordox is a snob as well.
<Meanwhile> Lovelu.
<Meanwhile> lovely*
<Vordox> WindWhistler: The era of game generations made a big leap in those 6 years.
<Shimmer> Everyone's so busy arguing they don't say hi back to me :'(
<Sylandest> howdy, Shimmer!
<killerpony7733> Shimmer: Hiya!
<Meanwhile> Suddenly everything is explained.
<WindWhistler> Vordox: Which means...?
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Nah, don't care for my outer appearance, rather be true to myself and see things for what they are.
<Meanwhile> Vordox: So yeah, you're a snob.
<Vordox> WindWhistler: The reason games are good.
*Shimmer hugs Sylandest and killerpony7733
<killerpony7733> :)
<Vordox> Meanwhile: A snob doesn't mean that...
<Meanwhile> A very pretenious one at that.
<WindWhistler> Games are good because there's a 6-year difference?
<Meanwhile> You hold yourself above others because of the way you interpret your world view. You're a pretentious snob who's trying too hard.
<Glacymr> don't cry D:
<Vordox> WindWhistler: No, the core of it changed heavily, from what made games good, to what made games of what they are today.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Well yeah, the WORLD is mine, as with everyone else...?
<Vordox> I fail to see your point?
<Meanwhile> The point being that you're a douchebag.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Now you're just trying to insult me. :P
<Meanwhile> No trying about it, I'm literally insulting you.
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: Vordox please take that discussion to a PM :S
<Shimmer> Can you argue in PMs please?
<WindWhistler> Vordox: He got you there.
<killerpony7733> Shimmer: what i asid
<Spectrum_Rush> Vordox: Meanwhile stop this petty arguement or take it to pms
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Meh don't care. You think what you know, and I what I know.
<Vordox> I think what I know*
<WindWhistler> Something tells me they aren't gonna take this to a PM.
<WindWhistler> Either that or Meanwhile is gonna stop and Vordox is gonna keep going.
<Vordox> I stopped starting
<Vordox> I'm just retorting
<Meanwhile> I started stopping.
<Shimmer> You're both acting like kids :)
<Vordox> Hehe. :P
<prince-dari> Wait
<prince-dari> No
<prince-dari> I missed the argument
<Sylandest> howdy, prince-dari!
<prince-dari> What was it about
<Vordox> prince-dari: Games and tastes
<Shimmer> Differing opinions about games
<Spectrum_Rush> prince-dari: nothing lets leave it at that
<Meanwhile> Shimmer: You never grow up you just learn how to act in public.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Troo dat
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: pretend your in public then
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: Well said.
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: you're*
<Shimmer> This is a public chatroom, you saying you never learned it?
<Meanwhile> Shimmer: You startin'?
<WindWhistler> You guys DO realize you're just starting another argument, right?
<Vordox> Shimmer: If you do as everyone does, what do you ever learn, Shimmer ?
<String_Shredder> pootis
<WindWhistler> So you're about to become hypocrites
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: grammar nazi:D

<Vordox> Shimmer: Interesting, You found an scapegoat. XD

<Mutterguy> Scoot-Scootaloo and what's worst given a chance they'll eat cat food!
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: you made me spit my drink with that one, lol

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hey dari, do you like doctors and the numeber 11?
<WindWhistler> Sylandest: Really?! :o
<Spectrum_Rush> Scoot-Scootaloo: so you like matt smith then
<WindWhistler> Wait, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
<Meanwhile> Scoot-Scootaloo: what language is number 11?
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: hehe, yes. Fortunately, it was only a little bit. And I'd say good, since you made me laugh XD
*WindWhistler made someone laugh! Self-esteem went up by 42!
*Sylandest claps for WindWhistler :)
*WindWhistler gets cocky and starts making lame jokes and soon everyone gets tired of her and then she learns a lesson about friendship
<String_Shredder> I hate the number 42. 43 is WAAAAAAY better
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: that made me laugh.
<Saturn> 08,01WindWhistler: i didn't realise you were a she
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: O U
<WindWhistler> Saturn: Really? O_o
<prince-dari> INB4 no girls on the internet
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: I just realized...that could very well be a future episode :O
<Sylandest> prince-dari: there's no girl-darnit!
<prince-dari> :>
<WindWhistler> Sylandest: It already happened with Mare Do-well.
<String_Shredder> WindWhistler is best pony
<WindWhistler> String_Shredder: You got that right! :D
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: yes, but in terms of being cocky about one's actions and their selves. Not about being humorous, hehe.
<Saturn> 08,01WindWhistler: i'd make a joke about not hitting on you now knowing this, but honestly for me if it has a pulse, it's fair game
<Meanwhile> Yeah but who'd that episode be about.
<MaidSurge> Ohai Saturn and prince-dari! :$
<Meanwhile> Saturn: let me find you a sheep.
<Saturn> 08,01correction: sapient and with a pulse
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: I bet it'd be about one of the CMC.
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: That works actually. Cutie Mark Crusader Comedians yaaaaay
<String_Shredder> Scootaloo
<String_Shredder> but are they fluffy?
*WindWhistler captured a fly!
<WindWhistler> I hate flies!
<Sylandest> Saturn: I'm sapient and have a pulse...but wait, I'm married to you already...:D
<WindWhistler> Seriously, they're one of the most pointless animals on this planet.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Girls? WTH are girls?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Is it like a Mare?
<WindWhistler> Scoot-Scootaloo: We're aliens.
<WindWhistler> We come to take over the boys.
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: ah, i see. no sexytimes there, then.
<CountDoofus> In your language, they're known as "mares" or "fillies".
<WindWhistler> ....wait, that sounded wrong
<Meanwhile> ./)women(\
<Saturn> 08,01do ho ho
<Phase4> 00,02thats enough tf2
<Sylandest> Scoot-Scootaloo: they are beings beyond comprehension
<Phase4> 00,02anyone else going to take over?
<WindWhistler> We're superior beings.
<WindWhistler> Phase4: I will!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Well, my mind is blon O_O
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: don't start that kind of convo.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03blown*
<Sylandest> Saturn: but-but...I want sexytimes! :( I dressed up and everything!
<Saturn> 08,01WindWhistler: i can assure you, flies are not pointless
<Mutterguy> WindWhistler, I surrender!
<prince-dari> I was thinking of streaming a carry on film Phase4
<Meanwhile> I hate gender wars more than I hate race wars.

<Invi> xD
<Petrified_Discord> To space!
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: What's l2mIRC?
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: It's shorthand for "Learn to mIRC"
<Invi> I guess you lost a little something there
<WindWhistler> Oh.
<Vordox> What...the...buck..is...that?
<WindWhistler> Nah, too lazy.

<Meanwhile> Fair enough.
<Petrified_Discord> Barrel roll
<prince-dari> Suddenly engines are for casuals?
<omnipony> hey everypony
<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, i suppose
<Meanwhile> More like "suddenly I lost the back half of the plane"
<WindWhistler> prince-dari: Engines are for WIMPS
<Meanwhile> Stick a cockpit to a rocket. That's all you need to do really.
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: atleast it told you wat happened
<WindWhistler> Now stop distracting me! I have some star systems to conquer!
<Spectrum_Rush> wiggle wiggle wiggle
<Kammerjunk> WindWhistler: SoaSE?
<Petrified_Discord> *wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle yeah*
<Petrified_Discord> It's an off-roader?
<WindWhistler> Kammerjunk: I'm gonna assume that's a game. Nope.avi
<Meanwhile> Dem fins.
<WindWhistler> I'm playing Spore.
<Kammerjunk> WindWhistler: Oh. It stands for Sins of a Solar Empire.
<Meanwhile> Brb.
<Kammerjunk> Spore is fun. Would be more fun with a multiplayer mode in the space age.
<Phase4> 00,02TO SPACE
<WindWhistler> Somehow I am amused Phase4's creation.
<Mutterguy> wait is it effectively flaping it's wings?
<Phase4> 00,02not my creation
<Sylandest> I see the middle pilot has found the "special" oxygen tank :D he does not give a buck at all
<Phase4> 00,02downloaded it
<Invi> would be more fun if always mutiplayer mode Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Invi: Trudat
<Vordox> FASTER FASER
<WindWhistler> Kammerjunk: I dunno...they'd probably attack your colonies so often you couldn't get anything done. That would be annoying.
<Sylandest> howdy, Invi!
<Invi> hi Sylandest
<WindWhistler> Then again, they could help take out the Grox so I don't keep having to go back to protect my colonies...
<Petrified_Discord> So does this thing have, like...fuel? How is it flying?
<WindWhistler> Petrified_Discord: A wizard did it.
<Kammerjunk> WindWhistler: Meh. Between eco system collapse and Grox, I'd have enough trouble anyway.
<Invi> Petrified_Discord wing flapping
<Phase4> 00,02needs ~300M/s before it sustains
<Petrified_Discord> Invi: :D In space? Seems legit :)
<WindWhistler> Kammerjunk: You should get green for Tribal and Civilization stages. One of them lowers the rate of eco disasters.
<Phase4> 00,02cant actualy get this into sapce
<Kammerjunk> Petrified_Discord: Hey, don't question the Kerbin... Kerbal... Whatever.
<Invi> Petrified_Discord this isn't space silly. look at the atmosphere meter ^^
<Phase4> 00,02it needs an atmosphere
<WindWhistler> Lol I was gonna say...you need air to keep flying.
<Petrified_Discord> Well some space...plane...this is *huff*
<WindWhistler> and there's no air in space.
<WindWhistler> in space no one can hear you die.
<Mutterguy> Phase4 I can see where the space center is....
<Invi> total air control :D
<WindWhistler> GOSH DARN IT I KEEP GETTING DISTRACTED FROM SPORE
*WindWhistler rages
<Spectrum_Rush> nice airleron roll Phase4

<WindWhistler> Phase4: DO A BARREL ROLL!
<WindWhistler> He's falling, isn't he.
<Spectrum_Rush> WindWhistler: he just did
<Invi> he is
<WindWhistler> WHEEEEEEEEEE

<Bronysith> WindWhistler: but your seupporting Evil Assholes
<WindWhistler> Hey, Kammerjunk, do you know any tricks to finding more terraforming tools?
<WindWhistler> It's hard to tell when a planet has an artifact or a terraforming tool...
<WindWhistler> or when it's pirates.
<Kammerjunk> WindWhistler: I just know about 'chieves and artifacts.
<WindWhistler> Oh.
<CrazyCherry> Space ghost pirates!!
<WindWhistler> Ah, well, I'll just look it up. And get distracted even more.
<Kammerjunk> WindWhistler: Before you know it, you'll get nothing done in Spore today.
<WindWhistler> Kammerjunk: That's usually how it is when I look up stuff for games.
<Meanwhile> Back.

<Meanwhile> You die without any idea of your impending death. What?
<killerpony7733> or how ever you spell it
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: no idea
<prince-dari> >stingray
<prince-dari> >been known to kill
<omnipony> Steve Irwin flashback
<prince-dari> ^
<OtakuTom> Because you pass out unexpectedly, Meanwhile. You drown once you pass out.
<Petrified_Discord> killerpony7733: Hypoxia. But you got the spanish version right :)
<killerpony7733> Petrified_Discord: hah what is it exactly?
<BroKnee> Meanwhile You don't know your about to die, your brain cuts off momentarily and you drown while unconcious :p
<MaidSurge> Stingrays took Steve Irwin from us :'(
<Spectrum_Rush> was this before or after irwins death
<prince-dari> After for sure
<twilight_sprinkle> lol the reminds me of nigahigas survival video
<MaidSurge> Mah loongs a'e now bersting
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: hey you play magicka right?
<Invi> dat poor sting ray
<DrHobo> back- AND WTH IS THAT! OAO
<IowaBrony> The poor stingray :'(
<prince-dari> Poor sting ray? Poor Steve Irwin
<prince-dari> :<
<omnipony> Fluttershy's reaction..:'( HOW DARE YOU:[
<twilight_sprinkle> yay we killed an animal
<Bronysith> IowaBrony: its revenge for irwin
<Petrified_Discord> killerpony7733: Basically when parts of your body don't have enough oxygen. It usually ends with you passing out and, if you're undewater, drowning
<MaidSurge> DrHobo: man vs wild
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, I just need to reinstall it. I own it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: so you havent played it yet?
<DrHobo> MaidSurge: I know, but what was that ANIMAL!?
<prince-dari> Ohai Ash
<prince-dari> Got the boulder badge yet?
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, just a bit. I'm just kinda... terrible. :D
<MaidSurge> DrHobo: a stingray
<killerpony7733> Petrified_Discord: interesting it's like a blackout but underwater?
<Meanwhile> Inb4 girth
<prince-dari> ^
<DrHobo> MaidSurge: oh
<Bronysith> prince-dari: i always thought irwin would die of irony. you know, a crocodile
<Shimmer> Bronysith: Did you know fans of Irwin hunted sting-rays and cut of their tails as revenge after he died?
<Invi> prince-dari well you have to admit Steve often provked animals
<Bronysith> Shimmer: good
<Petrified_Discord> killerpony7733: Well you don't need to be undewater when it happens, but if you're swimming you're gonna drop under the surface
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: i dont get the difference between characters, the desciptions are weird <.<
<prince-dari> Bronysith: Yeah, I think most people were expecting something to happen eventually, but not what actually happened
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: sherlock mage seems to be op, as he can find secrets others cant
<Bronysith> prince-dari: well....irwin would make a great doctor lol
<MaidSurge> Bronysith: he surely did! I mean, crocodiles never got to eat him and then a tiny stingray is his end?
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, some are WAY better than others. I can't remember which one is the best, but there are ones with better offsets than others.
<twilight_sprinkle> fig. 12 tree
<killerpony7733> MaidSurge: it was pure chance it hit his heart with the tail and killed him
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: wow, the correct use of irony. have +1 internets
<Bronysith> Saturn: why ty my fellow brony
<Meanwhile> I'm fairly sure Steve Irwin being killed by a crocodile isn't ironic.
<Kammerjunk> Irony: The opposite of what one expects.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: eh i guess il just go with sherlock mage
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: "Crocodile Hunter"
<Saturn> 08,01yes, it is.
<Saturn> 08,01he hunts the crocodiles, and is meant to be in control of them
<omnipony> Fail
<Petrified_Discord> MaidSurge: They also say it would have been better if he hadn't pulled the stinger out
<Sylandest> dat laugh
<Saturn> 08,01if they eat him, that's not what is expected
<DrHobo> Hey Ninjazz, have you read fanfic about Applejack becoming tiny again and being tortured by Applebloom recently? Because I accidently read something like that, someone named Ninjazz in the comments made a really hilarious remark about it :P
<Saturn> 08,01i suppose it depends on how you look at it
<Om> Ninjazz: Cast a super spell!
<Meanwhile> Saturn: going by that name, yeah. But he spends most of his time with them, it wouldn't be surprising if eventually his luck runs out.
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, that's a good one. It doesn't have much offsets.
*Bronysith gives Saturn a lyra plushie
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: kk
<Saturn> 08,01if you see it as "he pokes crocodiles, he's gonna get eaten", *then* it's not ironic, it's coincidental
<prince-dari> Dat's one cool shelter
<Ninjazz> DrHobo, I am the very same. Yes. And don't read that fanfic every again. ^-^;
<Nyria> Oh Bear grylls~ Did he drink his piss yet?~
<Ninjazz> ever*
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> This is animal snuff! O_O
<Meanwhile> Nyria: No, but he did eat a sea cucumber.
<killerpony7733> prince-dari: he is god damn good at making improvised shelters you should give him that
<Nyria> Meanwhile: Egh. Lovely~
<Saturn> 08,01in that manner, being killed by a stingray *was* ironic
<Sylandest> Nyria: no, not yet, lol. and good morning! :)
<Petrified_Discord> Dat roofing
<Nyria> Sylandest: Morning~
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> :O
<Sylandest> Nyria: how are you today?
<IowaBrony> I wish I could make such an awesome shelter.
<prince-dari> His little shelter has better drainage the all of London
<prince-dari> DO HO HO
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i'm eating carrot cupcakes
<Ninjazz> Ohai, Om. Didn't see you.
<Saturn> 08,01so my life is awesome
<DrHobo> Ninjazz: haha, I wonder what would drive someone to write that. I can understand people writing clop, it's just their liking but, that fanfic was the sort of thing to traumatize 30 year old men ;A;
<omnipony> lol
<Nyria> Sylandest: I'm wonderful ^-^
<killerpony7733> Saturn share please!
<Nyria> Sylandest: How about you?~
<Saturn> 08,01DrHobo: which one?
*Saturn 08,01throws cake at killerpony7733
<Bronysith> wow

<Sylandest> Nyria: I'm doing well, hehe. Its a relaxed morning so far, no complaints here :)

<Sylandest> Ninjazz: :O I shalt not touch the thing!
<Ninjazz> Sylandest, gewd.
<Sylandest> Saturn: oh you :D
<Saturn> 08,01DrHobo: sounds hilarious
<omnipony> True they get pissed at people having pets
<Tervicz> Gordon Ramsey says: It's raw!
<DrHobo> Saturn: It was meant to be taken seriously ;A;
<Sylandest> ...........
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Turn THIS OFF!
<Saturn> 08,01DrHobo: that makes it even more hilarious
<Ninjazz> DrHobo, why?
<Spectrum_Rush> omnipony: PETA'S jimmys are eternally rustled
<twilight_sprinkle> DrHobo: youre a monster!
<killerpony7733> Anyone reminded of the Dayz mod when he talked about the night?

<Meanwhile> Damn palm frond.

<DrHobo> Saturn: I guess... Twilight_Sprinkle: I DIDN'T WRITE IT! D: Ninjazz: Saturn asked!

<MaidSurge> DrHobo: eagles often pick up turtles and drop them from great heights to crack their shells and eat them
<Sylandest> Everlasting_Joy: African or European swallow?
<Om> Sylandest: You just wana see bear parts :D
<DrHobo> MaidSurge: oh

<Sylandest> Om: I do not! XD
<Everlasting_Joy> Sylandest: :D.
<prince-dari> Which was actually the bald head of the philosopher
<Om> Sylandest: Suit yourself xD
<prince-dari> So it dropped the turtle on him to crack the shell
<Sylandest> dramatic shirt throw!

<prince-dari> If anyone says that they wouldn't be scared in that situation
<prince-dari> I call absolute bullshit
<MaidSurge> Hey Wrek! :)
<diddutz> fish-hook made out of fishbone, the irony
<dr-whooves> ^THIS
<Om> I would have been screaming a bit...
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: sure we would be scared, but its not the worst situation possible
<Sylandest> prince-dari: you have a phone line to contact bull shit? :D
<derpy_pony> the correct term were thrilled
<DrHobo> prince-dari: I would be in that situation, but I wasn't so call not scary :D
<Om> And the sharks would be drinking piss
<Meanwhile> If I were in imminent threat of being eaten by a big ass fish I'd be scared about it.
<Dken2021> SimGretina, you make music?
<SimGretina> yeah
<Everlasting_Joy> Om, they secrete their piss.
<valoreins> got to me thinking... maybe one of us here is a famous brony musician in a disguise...
<derpy_pony> how often do you have the chance to get attacked by a shark?
<MaidSurge> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> ^^
*Petrified_Discord has swam with sharks
<Sylandest> ^^^
<Spectrum_Rush> bladefish
<Om> Everlasting_Joy: I never said it would be theirs,

<SimGretina> mmmmmmmm sucking his nuts
<derpy_pony> fish oil
<Meanwhile> Slurp the spinal fluid.
<twilight_sprinkle> spine brain
<MaidSurge> Petrified_Discord: :) must be beautiful
<omnipony> you have a better chance of getting killed by a falling coconut than getting attacked by a shark
<Meanwhile> Omnom raw turtle.
<RyunosukeKnT> McGuyver is not impressed
<Gaston> So there I was, watching the movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame, checking BronyState for what is playing on Friday.
<Gaston> Who would have guessed
<Petrified_Discord> MaidSurge: Pretty much :) There was this big-ass manta ray too, but it didn't want anything to do with us :P
<Meanwhile> Macguyver would've turned the shark into a helicopter
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Gaston> lol
<Sylandest> Meanwhile: sharcopter?
<Nyria> Ah I see Bear grylls is going to be saved by Otakon~
<MaidSurge> Petrified_Discord: mantas are pretty much innocuous :)
<RyunosukeKnT> STOP TALKING AND SIGNAL YOU FOOL
<Sylandest> Nyria: haha! :D
<derpy_pony> he will have to pay for the time they wasted on him
<Panda> Gaston: o_o

<Gaston> I was gonna vote for it too
<Dken2021> where'd his shirt go?
<Panda> Nyria: wait.. where is otakon
<Om> Nopony watches Bear Grylls like Gaston.
<Nyria> Panda: With Gondor I guess~
<Panda> Nyria: i miss him :(
<Gaston> om: true story
<RyunosukeKnT> umm

<Sylandest> Panda: Om's been here awhile XD

*Panda hugs Om
<RyunosukeKnT> just saying
<Om> Panda: You didn't notice xD
<twilight_sprinkle> RyunosukeKnT: how would he record then
<Panda> Nyria: oh? so... you know the situation?
<Dken2021> Ryunosuke he must use his two hands!
<MaidSurge> And then the helicopter flew in and took Bear Grylls away
<Meanwhile> And then they shot him with a cannon
<Nyria> Panda: Ja~
<Panda> Om: nope, you are incognegro :)
<Petrified_Discord> "I've run out of food, so I'm going to have to start eating my cameramen."
