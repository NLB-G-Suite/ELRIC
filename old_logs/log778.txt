<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: You mean you? :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: apparently you missed Digimon
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Awww! Which series?
<AdamTheDuck> First gen Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: AAWWWWW!
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, yay~
*Gold_Demona sad face :(

*Kipkat07_USAF works on his project
<AdamTheDuck> There there Gold_Demona
*AdamTheDuck gives Gold_Demona brownie :3
<Gold_Demona> Ooh!~ =D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Digimon is so confusing and irritating! The evolutions make no sense and there are no weaknesses 6_9
*Gold_Demona noms brownie
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<Sumica> 00,10oh I know every one poke Phase4 to stream
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It's not Pokemon, you silly. It doesn't work the same.
*AdamTheDuck pokes Phase4 :3
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Comparing Digimon to Pokemon is dumb.
<Phase4> 00,02i'm busy being clever
<Jmo> Trying to be clever*
<Jmo> <:
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: And what do you mean confusing?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: maybe that's why I don't care for Digimon :D
*AdamTheDuck balances a spoon on Jmo's nose :3
<Gold_Demona> The digimon evolutions make perfect sense if you're not trying to compare it to Pokemon
<Gold_Demona> Digivolutions are more like "battle forms" than actual evolutions.
<MadSurge> Then why aren't they called "battle forms"?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Because that's boring?
<Jmo> Why does it matter @_@
<Gold_Demona> IKR?
<MadSurge> Because I am whiny and want to be polemic D:
<Jmo> Quit being whiny before I hurt you.
*AdamTheDuck ties Jmo down to the floor with duct tape :<
<Gold_Demona> I wanted a digimon back in those days. :<
<AdamTheDuck> Bad Jmo, hurting people is not nice :|
<Jmo> And I'm supposively nice?
<Kipkat07_USAF> O__O IM GETTING TIRED D:
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: one in particular?
*AdamTheDuck taps a spoon on Jmo's head :>
<Kipkat07_USAF> But wait... if I miss school I will have teh weekend to do my projects...
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Either Gatomon or Wizardmon.
<Jmo> How about you just do the damn project?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: They're both champion level though, so I'd probably have their respective smaller forms. :P
<Kipkat07_USAF> and also the fact that I have 3 tests and Im feckin tired
<MadSurge> Wizardmon? was it a Black Mage expy? :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: expy? O_o
<Kipkat07_USAF> Jmo: I cant function without sleep and I have teh project and 3 tests today.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: a very similar looking character
<MadSurge> :D
<Jmo> That's your own fault.
<Gold_Demona> I find it funny that most people in my time zone are just ending their days when I've just started mine. (it's almost 6am here) XD
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ah yeah. He does look similar to a black mage.
<[]DeadpoolDash> did stream die?
<Kipkat07_USAF> Gold_Demona: same here
<AdamTheDuck> []DeadpoolDash, seems so

<aniderp> applesauce fell on my shirt
<Phase4> 00,02who knows what optimus is?
<Phase4> 00,02the nvidia thing, not the autobot
<Jmo> In which context?
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, a transfor - oh ok... :D
<Jmo> Nvidia optimus GPU for mobiles?
<JRP2234> Phase4 gmod is giving me the shits
<Jmo> or am I thinking of something else.
<Phase4> 00,02nvidia optimus allows your computer to run things on either the intergrated gpu or the dedicated
<Phase4> 00,02it turns the dedicated gpu off when not needed
<JRP2234> Phase4 can you help me
<Phase4> 00,02it has to decide ahead of time what runs where, it does this by executable name
<Phase4> 00,02'Updater.exe' is one of those names listed to run on the dedicated
<JRP2234> i cant get gmod to reconize the mlp pack or any packs anymore
<aniderp> and the dude has the 12:00 lunch not the 11:00

<Spell-of-Gaming> How exactly large are the Wii U games, anyway?
<Jake> yes alexxm i know
<alexxm> you ok Jake
<Spell-of-Gaming> Wii U took less time than hacking an Apple product
<Jake> i dont know anymore
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dear god, Nintendo.
<Deacon> hey, at least they're utelizing the internet now, which other competitors did years ago
<XAX> Phase4: Seen "banned from tf2 today"?

<Jake> i know
<Phase4> 00,02btw i have cake
<Phase4> 00,02:3

<shana> so nothing new
<CrystalPhoenix> Jake, go read Background Pony
<Phase4> 00,02shana, ah
<CrystalPhoenix> it may not shock you but dang
<alexxm> CrystalPhoenix i'd say the mulan one was my favorite as it reminds me of my favorite film the crow
<Jake> i also read art of distress
<Gold_Demona> The cake is a spai
<Blarg> lucky you, phase4
<XAX> CrystalPhoenix: Yeah, just go read it. Should only take a night.
<XAX> >_>
<Phase4> 00,02shana, so now we're waiting for a wii -> wii u mode exploit or a native one
<Spell-of-Gaming> Cake? Better put ice cream on it.
<CrystalPhoenix> XAX it would take second if you were shitti
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, it has fresh cream
<Phase4> 00,02sponge cake
<Gold_Demona> Mmm cake and ice cream. ^_^
<Blarg> D:
<Deacon> *drools*
*Jmo slaps XAX around a bit with a large trout
<Gold_Demona> Spongecake square pan?
<Jmo> Yer still bad kiwi.
<Phase4> 00,02now it is all gone
<Phase4> 00,02was good cake
<Blarg> You cruel person, you ;A;
*aniderp needs to be held
<CrystalPhoenix> anywho

<Phase4> 00,02hackaday is less interesting than it used to be
*Jmo holds aniderp
*Gold_Demona hugs aniderp
<Jmo> wooo
<CrystalPhoenix> so see you guys at Brony Movie Night
<Jmo> Pfft, too slow dema
<Jmo> :>
<Spell-of-Gaming> When I emulate GBA games on Wii, it gives me a slight eye strain
<Gold_Demona> Jmo XP
<tom123x> I'm gonna go now..
<Phase4> 00,02used to be clever use of stuff
<Phase4> 00,02now its mostly hobby electronics news
<Sumica> 00,10Oh I know this one
<shana> why don't you sing along Sumica :)
<tom123x> Huh?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Due to the fact that the TV has stupid video settings
<Blarg> lookit you, you tech-savvy folks
<Spell-of-Gaming> Or either the TV being crappy overall
<Gold_Demona> I'm not tech savvy. I'm completely lost. :D
<Gold_Demona> But I nod and smile like I understand what they're talking about. :>
<Phase4> 00,02so aparently valve broke the gmod servers
<Deacon> Spell-of-Gaming or because the VBAGX kinda sucks at emulation GBA game properly
<tom123x> 'Murica
<Gold_Demona> buck yeah
<Blarg> I tend to do the same, Gold. :c
<CrystalPhoenix> I leave you guys with this http://su.pr/23oCcO
<CrystalPhoenix> tourlou now
<Phase4> 00,02ip: 198.71.92.231
<Phase4> 00,02steam got all confused
<Phase4> 00,02awww
<Phase4> 00,02updates
<Spell-of-Gaming> VBAGX lags/freezes a frame for a milisecond sometimes
<Spell-of-Gaming> It lags for a second, though.
<Canebridge> Oh god, that track brings back memories.. Shocking memories
<Deacon> the framerate isn't that good for most games either
<Spell-of-Gaming> I hate it when it lags on Kirby
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh dear god
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dubstep song for an ice cream
<Spell-of-Gaming> bleh
<Canebridge> Never playing that game again.. Ever
<Jake> if i can trust my cpu meter emulatin a ds game needs 20% power and emulating a snes game <1%
<Deacon> ice cream and cake and cake?
<Blarg> So I'm gonna go for now. Thank you all for the welcome. Might be back later, maybe under a different nick or something.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have a sudden urge for ice cream sandwich
<Spell-of-Gaming> Or something.
<Deacon> alright, seeya then Blarg
<Jake> ok bai then Blarg
<Spell-of-Gaming> bai Blarg :3

<Jmo> dafuq
<Deacon> I would, but my laptop kinda sucks at doing it
<alexxm> heading out to the shops back soon
<aniderp> this laptop wont be able to handle it
<Spell-of-Gaming> I can understand having a few games only for Steam but
<alexxm> heading out to the shops back soon
<Spell-of-Gaming> No Steam?
*aniderp is asahamed and sits in corner ;_;
*Jmo huggles aniderp
<Jmo> Steam isn't for everyone
<Phase4> 00,02steams probably the best game distribution service out there right now
<Phase4> 00,02theres a few with less drm or more of different types of games but meh
<Phase4> 00,02dat failed password
<aniderp> is tf2 free?
<Phase4> 00,02dat double failed password o_O
<Deacon> and the games are tax free!
<Canebridge> Yep, free-to-play since.. Can't remember
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Revolution08
<Jmo> TF2 is free, yes.
<Phase4> 00,02password is ponies
<Jake> how do i connect to this ip
<aniderp> is steam free to get though? -shot-
<Phase4> 00,02Jake, cant remember how it works in gmod, open the console and type connect 198.71.92.231
<Phase4> 00,02aniderp, yup
<Jmo> Yes it is aniderp.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Origin needs my payment information, even though my game is already free because of a coupon, are you serious
<Phase4> 00,02Revolution08, how you fail at ponies
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Yes, Steam and TF2 are both free.
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's already free of tax
<Jake> and how can i open the console Phase4
<aniderp> i need a new laptop for lots of new things and steam
<Phase4> 00,02Jake, press ~
<Phase4> 00,02same as the ` key
<Phase4> 00,02above tab
<Revolution08> Phase4: i typed connect 198.71.92.231 ponies but it didnt work
<Jmo> LOl
<Phase4> 00,02Revolution08, password ponies then connect
<Jake> in a running game or in menu?
<aniderp> cup of flour
<aniderp> vanilla
<Canebridge> So I've seen a lot of clips made with Gmod - But how does it actually work? (Never seen it "played" before)
<Jmo> One does not simply play Gmod.
<Canebridge> *Watches stream intensely*
<Phase4> 00,02Revolution08, open the console, type 'password ponies' then 'connect [ip]'
<Deacon> I'm still confused with gmod
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, you REALLY have to know what you're doing to make anything in gmod. >.>
<aniderp> how does the tf2 ponies thing work?
<aniderp> i wanna be a pony when i get it..
<Jmo> Magic.
<Jmo> :3
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: It's a mod.
<aniderp> all the mods free?
<aniderp> i dont know this stuff D:
<Jmo> It's a simple mode, one person is chosen to be the pony and has to kill your team, if you aren't the pony your objective is to kill ze pony. If you're the pony, vice versa.
<Jmo> Mods are free.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: They better be. They're fan made. :D
<Jmo> And are automatically downloaded when you connect to one of the services.
<Canebridge> Ohh, Half-life interface - That I do know
<LyraHeartstrings> heeeeeeeellooo
*aniderp is stupid
<Jake> Phase4: i can connect but how do i enter the password?
<Deacon> lali-ho LyraHeartstrings
<Jmo> You aren't stupid aniderp :P
<shana> Jake: type "password ponies" before connecting
<Kandarihu>
<Jmo> Dafuq.
<Kandarihu>
<Gold_Demona> Woah, what?
<Jmo> Kandarihu?
<Deacon> blanks?
<XAX> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354272475279.jpg Picture makes Equestria look like an awesome place.

<Phase4> 00,02ohai LyraHeartstrings
<Canebridge> How much is Gmod? I feel eager to try it now, lol
<LyraHeartstrings> hai :)
<Jmo> Isn't it like $9.99?
<Gold_Demona> I think so
<Jmo> Yeah it is.
<Deacon> yea, about $10
<aniderp> you said everything was free D:
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: No we didn't
<Jmo> Gmod isn't TF2
<aniderp> oh
<Canebridge> Ack, I can roll with that - Imma go get it now *Hopes for fast download*
<Deacon> the "game" you pay for, the stuff that you can add is
<aniderp> i thought it was tf2
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Nope
<aniderp> i dont know about this stuff ;_;
<aniderp> what other games free on steam?
<Wrek> 05evenin buckers
<Gold_Demona> Hai Wrek! =D
<Deacon> lali-ho Wreky
<Kandarihu> Alright. My need for a new computer has now become an emergency. This laptop's been glitching out more and more lately, but this is the first time it's affected Bronystate. And I DO accept all responsibility for what just happened.
<Gold_Demona> dem birds
<Canebridge> Ohai Wrek - Saw the latest drawing result today! Pwetty stuff
<Wrek> 05^ becasue its a big deal when spacebar gets stuck
<Wrek> 05thanks Canebridge :3
<Gold_Demona> Also grats on EQD feature, Wrek
<Wrek> 05ill be honest
<Wrek> 05EqD isnt suc ha milestone anymore

<Gold_Demona> That sucks. :<
<Gold_Demona> They have no taste. >:C
<Wrek> 05but it does have ~280 faves in less than a day
<Kandarihu> My plans for moving off this laptop will have to include a full F-Disk on the internal hard drive. If mom saw that whole video driver crashiness the other day, she'd throw a well-justified fit.
<Wrek> 05and 23 comments
<Wrek> 05so im happy
<Canebridge> I see Garry's Mod and Garry's Mod 9 - Which one?
<Wrek> 05it seems i get more traffic from derpibooru and otehr sources

<Kandarihu> Canebridge, which version?
<Wrek> 05also
<Canebridge> Version?
<aniderp> btw if i do get steam.. my name will probly be Anime
<Kandarihu> The free one requires Half Life 2. The paid version doesn't
<aniderp> if that name isnt taken xD
<Wrek> 05mfw sabaton will play live in Umeå next month
<Jmo> That will probably be taken aniderp :P
<XAX> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354278296331.jpg I wouldn't want to shoot anything.
<Jmo> But you can still give it a try.
<aniderp> oh
<Canebridge> I got the 10 dollar one *shrugs*
<Phase4> 00,02Canebridge, 13
<aniderp> in a few years i will try to get steam
<Kandarihu> aniderp, why a few years?
<aniderp> this laptop wont be able to handle it
<aniderp> it shuts off :\
<Canebridge> Imma try log onto the server when I can - I'll probably be derping around though, hurr
<aniderp> tryed to play sims 3 a few times.. it shut off each time
*Gold_Demona wants a laptop... even though she already has two computers...
<Jmo> Egh laptop users.
<Gold_Demona> I think laptops are neat. :>
<JRP2234> now Phase4
<Deacon> they're portable!
<Gold_Demona> ^
<JRP2234> why do i have a ping of 300
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, my laptop is my third computer. My other two are much less powerful than this.
<Jmo> Only for browsing and small things.
<Canebridge> Laptops be for studies - While at home, huge giant stationary PC *nods*
<Jmo> Anything more they're useless.
<aniderp> i should get a computer account on downstairs computer?
<aniderp> but... the one i had is bad with no net cause mother screwed it up years ago..
<Deacon> though I would prefer to buid a PC
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, that's fun.
<aniderp> so when someone logged on.. i will delete old one and make myself a new one just in case
<Wrek> 05btw aniderp
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: computer account? wut?
<Wrek> 05accoutn names are not display anems on steam
<LyraHeartstrings> pretty good drawing Wrek :)
<aniderp> we have a computer downstairs..its shared
<XAX> You can have ANY display name on steam.
<Canebridge> 14%.. Sooon
<Gold_Demona> Dat ragdoll
<XAX> I was using "I have to return some videotapes" as a steam name for a while lol
<XAX> Character limit is huge
<Jmo> That business card.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<XAX> Jmo: Oh my god.
<SirGanjalf> "That's bone"
<aniderp> the guys from tf2
<XAX> Eggshell...
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Heavy kerbals?
<XAX> You like Huey Lewis and the news?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Eh, nothing to do.
<Gold_Demona> I do!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ace of Spades.
<Gold_Demona> Huey Lewis is awesome :>
<XAX> Gold_Demona: IT'S HIP TO BE SQUARE.
<LyraHeartstrings> i have a friggin horrible cold :'(
<Kandarihu> XAX, that's an awesome steam name.
<Gold_Demona> Anyone who disagrees is wrong and should go to bread.
<Jmo> Huey Lewis isn't awesome.
<Jmo> <:
<XAX> Kandarihu: Lol. CSS cut the s off the end of videotapes when I got ingame. Still a large name.
<Gold_Demona> XAX: So hip!
<Gold_Demona> Jmo, you are wrong and should go to bread.
<Jmo> Never.
<XAX> I'm in bread.
<Kandarihu> XAX, That makes it even sillier. Awesome.
<aniderp> wait...
<aniderp> is amnesia on steam?
<Kandarihu> aniderp, yes
<Jmo> It is
<aniderp> free?
<XAX> Yeah.
<Jmo> Nope
<XAX> No.
<Kandarihu> aniderp, no
<aniderp> ;_;
<Deacon> not all games are free
<Canebridge> Looking at a basic car tutorial while downloading - I like the idea of this game!!
<Gold_Demona> Most games aren't free
<Gold_Demona> TF2 is one of the exceptions.
<aniderp> so i pay for it then i get everything?
<Deacon> but wait until a sale comes around for a low low price, 75% off even
<SirGanjalf> Anyone heard of Humble THQ Bundle?
<XAX> Phase4: Any good with wiremod?
<Jmo> <-
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Basically how it works is you buy a game and it downloads into your Stream library, and you can play it from there.
<aniderp> are their cards for steam at the store?
<Jmo> In USA? Usually.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: You mean gift cards?
<aniderp> yes
<Deacon> you can also use your credit/debit to buy things
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, it shows up in your library, and from there you can download it and launch it from there too.
<Wrek> 05i signle hadnedly fought off 5 guys and a sunderer
<Wrek> 05as ifniltrator
<Kandarihu> Er, aniderp, I meant that to you.
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: I know this. I'm trying to explain it to aniderp. :P
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, yes. Sorry. I have a habit of pinging the wrong person when correcting less than perfectly accurate explanations instead of the person the explanation is for.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: I've never tried looking for actual physical gift cards for Steam... You should check your local video game store to see if they exist. =/
<aniderp> or eletronic store
<Kandarihu> aniderp, only at Best Buy and Gamestop
<Deacon> eww, gamestop :s
<Jmo> eww America
<Jmo> I mean wut
*aniderp hates america
<Gold_Demona> Shyaddap Mojay. Go to bread
<aniderp> ;_;
<Jmo> Dema why you being so mean to me tonight
<Jmo> ;__;
<Canebridge> Is it possible to make a rollercoaster?
<aniderp> its not a free country
<Canebridge> *Sizzling with many crazy ideas for Gmod already*
<aniderp> they lie..
<Gold_Demona> Cuz I'm in a mean sort of mood. XP
<Jmo> :<
<Gold_Demona> Writer's block is making me mean
<Jmo> And you take it out on me. I see how it is.
<Gold_Demona> Yup. Because I wub you Mojay. :>
<Jmo> ;___;
<Kandarihu> aniderp, we are not our politicians. Most of the morons who voted Obama in really didn't understand the issues.
<aniderp> i voted for obama..
<aniderp> since romney is horrible
<Gold_Demona> They're BOTH horrible. So I didn't vote at all
<aniderp> i would have voted for derpy
<Gold_Demona> I think I'd rather have Twilight in office than Derpy.
<aniderp> well atleast we have rights since rmoney isnt president
<Kandarihu> Right. Let me try to put it better. Most if not all of the people who voted to reelect Obama fell for all of the character assassination propaganda against Romney
<Gold_Demona> Stupid mudslinger ads
<aniderp> my work place would be gone if romney was president :\
<aniderp> its a work/program place
<Kandarihu> aniderp, do you really believe all this?
<Gold_Demona> Honestly, I don't think Obama's gonna be any better
<aniderp> how about.. i run for president? :D
<Gold_Demona> Yay!~
*Gold_Demona votes for aniderp
<Deacon> there was an ad in our local area to not vote for amendment 4, but it was to take out anything that was mentioned to jim crow laws since they're not being used, and the ad didn't even mention that
<aniderp> and ponies and zelda be all over the office!
<Gold_Demona> Yay!
<Kandarihu> aniderp, you fall for propaganda hook line and sinker. I wouldn't trust you in office.
<aniderp> i honestly didnt want to vote :\
<Gold_Demona> I didn't vote
*Kandarihu voted for Romney, and proudly
*Deacon did his voting already for the first time
*aniderp starts making her campaign thingys
<JRP2234> wow Phase4
<JRP2234> you dun goffed
<taoumi> well i'm going to go to over due sleep. nighty everypony
<aniderp> it was my first time voting aswell
<Gold_Demona> That's a really big sniper rifle
<Kandarihu> Oh, big sniper rifle
<Canebridge> *Returns from watching tutorials* Big guns..?
<aniderp> what should be on the papers Gold_Demona ?
<Gold_Demona> "Vote for me! I have muffins!" ? =D
<aniderp> good idea!
<Gold_Demona> Muffins for everypony!
<aniderp> with picture of derpy
<Deacon> yay
<Gold_Demona> :>
<aniderp> but what about the people who no like ponies? D:
<aniderp> i will have zelda ones also
<Gold_Demona> They can have muffins too. :>
<Deacon> double yay!
<Gold_Demona> Everypone gets muffins, even if they no lik ponies
<Canebridge> Da heck is that thing
<aniderp> eletction day of bronystate
<Gold_Demona> Interesting vehicle there
<Kandarihu> I think it needs some sort of braking system.
<Gold_Demona> Weee!~
<aniderp> running for the freedom and lots of muffins is aniderp
<Canebridge> Don't forget a helmet - Darn
<Gold_Demona> You know what would be awesome? If someone plunked the Kerbal model into gmod.
<Phase4> 00,02server lag
<Kandarihu> I wonder if animations from GMod could be imported into Source Film Maker.
<Gold_Demona> Probably not
<Canebridge> What was the details for getting onto the server?
<Canebridge> Pwease!
<aniderp> does the president make lots of money?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Eeyup. For the rest of his life
<aniderp> oooo
<aniderp> when can i become president?
<Deacon> iirc, if they get too rich, they have to be paid in cents
<Gold_Demona> Work 4-8 years... Be rich the rest of your life...
<aniderp> can i watch ponies as my work?
<aniderp> and play games like zelda
<RoboGerbil> president watching ponies, prolly more productive than what he does now....
<Gold_Demona> lol
<aniderp> and then.. there wont be a first man >:)
<Gold_Demona> vidja games
<aniderp> > : )
<Canebridge> President watching ponies and being a food judge - Dream job
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, they still keep working until they have enough money to retire.
<aniderp> haters gonna hate
<Kandarihu> And there SHOULD never be such a thing as "too rich"
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: Yeah, but they continue to get payment from being president.
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: Even when they're not anymore
<aniderp> my first thing as president..
<aniderp> throw bieber in jail! xD
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, they get a free home and security service detail for the rest of their life.
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: Yeah
<Deacon> aniderp but he's canadian
<aniderp> but he is in america
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: deport him
<aniderp> yes1
<aniderp> what abotu rebecca black?
<Gold_Demona> who?
<Deacon> exactly
<aniderp> she sings firday
<aniderp> friday
<Gold_Demona> oh
<Kandarihu> aniderp, you'd be threatening every artist in the recording industry if you tried to punish Justin Bieber and Rebecca Black for the kind of music they do.
<RoboGerbil> oh.. its friday today isnt it
<Gold_Demona> lol
<aniderp> but
<Gold_Demona> I honestly don't caer. :P
<aniderp> i will let adam lambert stay
<Gold_Demona> who?
<aniderp> he was on american idol
<RoboGerbil> i work 3rd shift, i think its still tursday :/
<Gold_Demona> Never watched American Idol
<aniderp> he was 2nd
<Gold_Demona> That tells me nothing. :D
<aniderp> i will gte a birdie
<aniderp> i will bring steve jobs back to life
<Gold_Demona> Steve Jobs doesn't need to come back
<aniderp> then who does?
<Gold_Demona> Jim Henson
<Kandarihu> Seriously. You want to wage a war on Justin Bieber, his entire fanbase will rise up as a dreadful army in his name. But he won't be the one giving orders.
<Gold_Demona> That man was awesome
<aniderp> not billy mays
<aniderp> he was annpoying
<[]DeadpoolDash> his fanbase are a bunch of little girls
<Gold_Demona> submarine roller coaster car?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Beliebers make weak agruments.
<aniderp> Gold_Demona: would you like a muffin? :>
<Kandarihu> []DeadpoolDash, the vast majority of little girls. Would self-defense be enough justification to slaughter an entire gender of several generations? We'd have the gender disparity of China if it came to that.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Why yes I would :>
<Spell-of-Gaming> *arguements
<JRP2234> THEN I CRASH
<Canebridge> I wub your car!
<[]DeadpoolDash> there are enough older girls to fill the gap
*aniderp gives muffins out
<SirGanjalf> dat Barney
<Gold_Demona> Barney! =D
*Gold_Demona wubs Barney Calhoun
<SirGanjalf> i miss him:'(
<SirGanjalf> dammit Gabe.
<aniderp> can we kill the dinosaur?
<Gold_Demona> Miss him? He didn't go anywhere
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: You mean he's not dead already?
<aniderp> we should kill that dinosaur
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: You mean he's not dead already?
<aniderp> i dont know D:
<[]DeadpoolDash> trust me, if we REALLY needed to repopulate the country we could do it in a weekend easy
<Gold_Demona> I haven't seen him in years
<Canebridge> 5% to go! Will I also need to download something when I enter the Gmod?
<aniderp> arrest justin bieber and give him to my freidn
<aniderp> she would be happy
<Kandarihu> It seems to me that Barney the Dinosaur was created in rebellion to the dark age of media that permiated the media. Bear that in mind.
<aniderp> and i will make peace with all countries when i become president
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: lol, good luck with that. :P
<aniderp> and continents
<[]DeadpoolDash> you will become continents?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: By making peace with all countries, you are by default making it with the continents as well.
<aniderp> we will all be happyyyy
<Gold_Demona> technically speaking
<aniderp> and no wars
<Spell-of-Gaming> What? You'll make peace with Antartica?
<aniderp> sure!
<Gold_Demona> No wars with the penguins
<[]DeadpoolDash> lolz at no war, someone will try to take power from you
<aniderp> am i suppose to?
<Kandarihu> aniderp, Obama's already trying to make peace with the countries who are 100% committed to our destruction. George W Bush tried to do that to a limited extent to offset his bad reputation.
<aniderp> no animal abuse will be tolerated
<aniderp> and if the pet does get abused they can attack the owner
<Kandarihu> aniderp, what is the role of government to you?
<Phase4> 00,02aparently i'm a fish
<aniderp> uhhh
<aniderp> am i suppose to know this stuff?
<Gold_Demona> LOL Barney's a fish. :D
<Canebridge> Hey Fishy4, what was the server IP?
<Kandarihu> You want to become President, don't you?
<aniderp> maybe!
<MadSurge> Oh boy, politics? :|
<aniderp> and and
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It never stopped. :P
<aniderp> sea ponies for everyone!
<shana> Canebridge: 198.71.92.231
<Gold_Demona> Yay! Seaponies!
<aniderp> do i win now? :>
<Canebridge> Thanks Shana - Off I go!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: save me from this topic D:
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Sorry, I'm too busy encouraging it. :D
<[]DeadpoolDash> You can't make peace with an ideology, you either stomp it out or make it extremely unbearable to follow. Stomping it out is the best and most permanent course.
<aniderp> Gold_Demona: can be vice p[resident
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Stomping like a G6~
<Gold_Demona> Woot! :D
<aniderp> then sea poniesss!
<Jmo> You still aren't MLG Scoot.
<Canebridge> Uhh, what gamemode is it?
<aniderp> and jaymoo the attourney
<Jmo> The truth hurts, doesn't it Scoot.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> !v1 me >: (
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 1*
<Jmo> In what?
<Gold_Demona> Woah wut?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Um.... some game you're not good at >_>
<[]DeadpoolDash> life
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Because MLG's NEVER play fair~
<Jmo> Implying I have a life.
<Jmo> Lel.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> lol
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: As long as you're not racist or in it only for your personal gain, I can tolerate conservatives :D
*Scoot-Scootaloo hugs Jmo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Good morning, everyone!
<Jmo> Mornin'
<MadSurge> Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo :)
<GhostColt> mornin
<SirGanjalf> stomp the ideology? Orks approve: http://images.wikia.com/warhammer40k/images/archive/0/02/20110512201600!Squiggoth.jpg
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I'm "so neutral that nobody gets my vote". Does that count?
<Kandarihu> Problem is, conservatives are constantly accused of both of those things all the times, usually baselessly. AND PEOPLE BELIEVE IT!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D nooo don't wast your vote!
<aniderp> muffins anyone? :D
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: in Italy unfortunately THEY ARE :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: What do you mean waste?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: not voting is wasting your vote D:
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: There's no point in me voting. I don't like any of the options.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Why cast my vote on an option I don't like?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: pick the option you hate the least!
<[]DeadpoolDash> ^
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I honestly think that's the stupidest suggestion ever.
<MadSurge> :|
<aniderp> gold not even mine when you're vice?
<aniderp> D:
<[]DeadpoolDash> lesser of two evils is still evil, but it is less evil
<Gold_Demona> I refuse to vote for evil
<Gold_Demona> Even if it's the lesser of two
<[]DeadpoolDash> but evil has cookies
<aniderp> nice has muffins
<Gold_Demona> I liek muffins :>
<Gold_Demona> I vote for muffins
<alexxm> so gmod's a game i thought it was a video maker thing?
<aniderp> obama gave me muffin :>
<[]DeadpoolDash> evil takes the muffins from the nice
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: It's a game that people can make videos with
<aniderp> he didnt but
<aniderp> i will give muffins@
<[]DeadpoolDash> evil has muffins and cookies
<alexxm> thanks Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: It's a sandbox game. You can pretty much do anything on it. :D
<aniderp> Gold_Demona: can we own a pet wolf in white house?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Nuuuu, wolf will eat us. D;
<aniderp> :< but they pretty
<Gold_Demona> But they wild and hungry :<
<aniderp> husky then!
<Gold_Demona> There's a reason there's no such thing as a domesticated wolf. >.>
<MadSurge> Problem is that italian lefters are seen as spineless incompetents and righters are seen as obnoxious jerks that only aim to their personal gain. I still prefer the incompetent guys, you see?
<alexxm> not if you raise it from a cub
<[]DeadpoolDash> If I was President, I would install a Gun Range on the lawn and invite everyone shoot guns with me.
<aniderp> wait.. does the vice live in whitehouse also?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: I have no idea...
<[]DeadpoolDash> no
<aniderp> its like a manison there though D:
<[]DeadpoolDash> living under the same roof is a national security risk
<Gold_Demona> Well, it makes sense. I wouldn't want to live with my coworkers. :D
<aniderp> you would have your own office!
<aniderp> and ponies and sea ponies and muffins
<[]DeadpoolDash> you usually dont want them in the same place, makes them easy targets to take both of them out in a single strike
<aniderp> oh
<Kandarihu> I can assure you, MadSurge. American conservatives aren't cut from the same cloth as the Italian conservatives.
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: I hope so
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: as long as they care for the country, I disagree but can respect them
<[]DeadpoolDash> look up the term : Liberal, it has been twisted quite a bit over the years
<[]DeadpoolDash> most conservatives would have been called Liberals not too long ago
<Phase4> 00,02yay storms
<MadSurge> :D there seems to be confusion about coalitions over the pond
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR021.loop.shtml
<[]DeadpoolDash> your doppler means nothing to me
<JRP2234> o fuck
<JRP2234> its a beast
<alexxm> what is that supposed to be
<alexxm> can you die in Gmod
<MadSurge> YAAAAY MONSTER SPAMMING :D
<MadSurge> alexxm: yes, but you respawn on the spot
<alexxm> so it doesn't matter MadSurge?
<MadSurge> Nope
<[]DeadpoolDash> death is an illusion
<MadSurge> ^
<alexxm> so it's like the lego star wars games then MadSurge?
<aniderp> i want a canoli ;_;
<MadSurge> alexxm: even less important than that :D
<[]DeadpoolDash> make the G-Man do nasty things in G-Mod
<MadSurge> :D
<[]DeadpoolDash> fly away, your planet needs you!
<Gold_Demona> dat wireframe

<alexxm> bye SuperBrony64
<[]DeadpoolDash> drink water and eat a banana
<aniderp> we got no banana
<[]DeadpoolDash> then eat something like one
<MadSurge> I wonder who started the trend of Gmod videos with the weird faces and ground sliding :D
<[]DeadpoolDash> nerds
<MadSurge> Ofc! :D
<SirGanjalf> lololololol
<[]DeadpoolDash> its almost time for hl2.exe to crash

<Jmo> I do Deadpool, so go lolz to your GW2 and quit trying to think for me.
<[]DeadpoolDash> there is a locked part of your brain you dont even know about and it wants bacon
<Jmo> Yeah now you're just being retarded.
<[]DeadpoolDash> name calling, now who is being retarded
<Jmo> The irony in that sentence.
<[]DeadpoolDash> its a thinker aint it

<AttackWithHugs> I jealous
<Shortcircuit42> I came here for ponies
<Shortcircuit42> turns out it is friday
<Shortcircuit42> so sad
<Gold_Demona> double candy cane
<AttackWithHugs> How is everyone able to draw their pony with pencil/paper and not have eraser marks but I do?
<Shortcircuit42> It's likely due to the scanner settings
<Jake> i have them too
<Shortcircuit42> greys can get blasted out
*Jmo pats AttackWithHugs
<Shortcircuit42> Example

<Shortcircuit42> scan
<Shortcircuit42> note the lack of smudges
<Shortcircuit42> http://shortcircuit42.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5lcntx
<Shortcircuit42> photo with minimal smudging
<Shortcircuit42> but lots more aberations are present
<Shortcircuit42> ok
<Shortcircuit42> apparently I type too fast
<Jmo> Na, you press enter too much.
<Shortcircuit42> :|
<Shortcircuit42> ok
<Jake> tl;dr: make some photoshop magic on it
<Shortcircuit42> basically
<Shortcircuit42> and that clever manouevre got me to 400 views. yay/
<AttackWithHugs> Lel I would but when I draw something with pen or pencil I intend to go over it in Photoshop but I never do....
<Shortcircuit42> well I just photograph them now
<Shortcircuit42> easier than scanning
<Jake> guess im doing a lot of thing wrong
<Jake> http://ragnar95.deviantart.com/#/d5m3jui
<Shortcircuit42> so I work hard to limit the amount of mess on the page
<Gold_Demona> Aww Derpy :D

<Kandarihu> Let me try to remember the shows that were on Nickelodeon before I turned 13 and decided to respect the "Kids Only" bump motif at the time: Danger Mouse, Inspector Gadget, David the Gnome... that's all I remember off the top of my head.
<Sundaysmile> Are you afraid of the Dark?
<Kandarihu> I forget if Pinwheel was still on at the time.
<VenHur> That was a SNICK show, I believe...
<Kandarihu> I turned 13 in 1991.
<VenHur> Borned in an Olympics year, and around the time when the Nintendo 64 was released in America.
<Sylandest> lol, donnie
<Sylandest> Did I spell that right?
<aniderp> yup
<Kandarihu> I was born in 1978. I was 2 when Reagan was elected. My childhood was awesome.
*Jmo slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
<Gold_Demona> Is that Tim Curry?
<Sundaysmile> yes
<Gold_Demona> I never noticed that before...
<Gold_Demona> How did I not notice that before...
<Kandarihu> Well, okay. The era in which my childhood was in was awesome. Everything kept getting better and better and better still.
<TheRandomkid321> SMASHING! Sorry thought we were due for one
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Sylandest> Jmo: myuh
<VenHur> I never known that before...
<Sundaysmile> Gold Demona took me ages to realise the dude from the Crystal Maze was Riff Raff
<Jmo> Sylandest: nyeh
*Jmo slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
<Gold_Demona> Sundaysmile: that who from what was who?
<VenHur> I heard of that show, some said it's one of the greatest game shows in the UK.
<Sundaysmile> Crystal Maze - it's a game show - Riff Raff is the dude from Rocky Horror Show
*Sylandest slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Gold_Demona> Sundaysmile: Oh! I only watched that movie once so I don't remember everyone's names. XD
<TheRandomkid321> Is anyone else ADDICTED to steampunk?
<VenHur> Plus, the theme to the game show is AWESOME!
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Not I
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Don't get me wrong, steampunk is cool, but it is not among my addictions. :P
<Gold_Demona> Anyone remember the Wild Thornberrys/Rugrats crossover movie?
<alexxm> Gold_Demona i do
<aniderp> i have it on dvd
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: I liked that movie. :>
<Gold_Demona> Oh no

<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I was thinking more of steampunk clothing.

<VenHur> I will never make a FAIL ever in my life, cause i'm more badass than them.
<Kandarihu> We only see these people in the most embarrasing moments in their lives. Let's not assume that they are always this bad.
<TheRandomkid321> Females. You are the most crucial member in the reproduction process... FUCKING ACT LIKE IT!!!!!
<twilight_squirtle> but Kandarihu it makes us feel better about ourselves
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Expansion on Upcoming Pony Book Summaries
<twilight_squirtle> Kandarihu: (being ironic,i agree with you ofc)
<TheRandomkid321> Twilight_Squitle speaks the truth
<twilight_squirtle> they just seem to overestimate their physical capabilities
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: you would know how female can act, would you? ;)
<VenHur> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8G9Go7opQ84/ULhjTNQzQzI/AAAAAAABFUY/guO3GQkT50s/s1600/1.JPG
<Kandarihu> VenHur, do you expect to be absolutely perfect about everything? Or are you going to live life scared and afraid to do anything out of fear of being caught on camera failing at something?
<TheRandomkid321> Bad idea!
<VenHur> Is that a...SEA PONY?!
<VenHur> ON G4?!
<TheRandomkid321> WHat part of you would think that that's a good idea?
<boynedmaster> shooby doo shoo shoo be doo
<VenHur> It's official, Sea Ponies are cannon.
<Kandarihu> VenHur, ... that is.
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge, I've never done any of this stuff but I see it all online.
<AttackWithHugs> Plus, I'm afraid someone might be secretly filming me. That's why I dance only at home
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: exactly! And for that you're a lady :3
*Jmo slaps MadSurge around a bit with a large trout
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge, a fun and crazy lady who rambles <3
<Jmo> Pfft, fun.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: I tend to act like Pinkie when excited, so I break into silly gigs often :D
<AttackWithHugs> Excuse me, Jaymo? Wanna repeat that a little louder? I didn't hear you.
<VenHur> It's official folks, I checked up the link, and based on the cover art, Seaponies and "Mermares" are now cannon.
<TheRandomkid321> I dance freestyle in public all the times because IDGARA! Also when I play those arcade games where you have a toy rifle and you pint it at the screen I pretend to get recoil on those and I always look down the sights... Hell there are probably 50+ vids of me online I don't know about.
*Kandarihu hands Jmo a large seapony with which to slap people around with.
<VenHur> We all know Seaponies, but Mermares?
<Jmo> This man, knows well.
<TheRandomkid321> Seaponies sem like mermares
<DaringDerpy> good evening bronystate :)
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge, I've been told that I am the Pinkie Pie amongst my friends
<TheRandomkid321> Mayby SeaStallions and MerMares?

<Gold_Demona> harsh
<boyned12> what fi you're the human random

<aniderp> shoo be doo
<aniderp> we love our sea ponies!
<TheRandomkid321> Whever people Tab me it fails.
<Gold_Demona> WHY IS SEA PONIES BEING CANON A BAD THING???
<Gold_Demona> I don't get it
<TheRandomkid321> YEAH NOW CANNIBALS CAN GO FISHING!
<alexxm> i don't either and i'm neutral on the whole seaponies thing\
<VenHur> The good news is that maaaaybe "Under The Sparkling Sea" might be a concept for an episode.
<aniderp> are they gonna shoo be do?
<Gold_Demona> But why is it a bad thing? Plz explain.
<aniderp> shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
<aniderp> sea ponies :>
<VenHur> The even better news: Probally a remake of "Call Upon The Sea Ponies", or a different song entirely.
<aniderp> no not a new song ;_;
<VenHur> It all depends on fanservice.
<aniderp> we love the original song
<aniderp> right Gold_Demona ?
<Gold_Demona> If the new sea ponies get a song, it HAS to be a new song.
<Gold_Demona> The original song is for the original seaponies
<VenHur> What's so wrong with "Call Upon The Sea Ponies"?
<aniderp> it has to be catchy though
<TheRandomkid321> inb4 Pop cover of original
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Are you doubting Daniel Ingram's ability to write a catchy new song?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i could see them incorperate Shoo bee doo in somehow like to the rythme of the sea ponies song
<aniderp> nah im not
<aniderp> i think he can do it!
<EspyLacopa|2> Ohhh, Caramel is getting a movie.
<VenHur> Really?!
<Gold_Demona> This is Daniel Ingram we're talking about. If anyone can write a new song worthy for the new seaponies, it's him.
<VenHur> REALLY?!
<VenHur> FREAKING. REALLY?!?!
<aniderp> true
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXC7q_rkwOY&hd=1 <-- The trailor.
<aniderp> no youtube when stream on
<Gold_Demona> I honestly would not want to see the old song recycled for the new generation. That's just lazy.
<Buytoast> is that...
<Buytoast> A RULE VIOLATION?
<Gold_Demona> That unallowed link
<VenHur> [sniff] I smell trouble.
<EspyLacopa> You say this as though I'd know there was a stream going on.
<TheRandomkid321> A RULE VIOLATION!? ALL MODS TO CHAT 1 ALL MODS TO CHAT1!

<VenHur> cachi01|confused: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8G9Go7opQ84/ULhjTNQzQzI/AAAAAAABFUY/guO3GQkT50s/s1600/1.JPG Seaponies in G4 is cannon now.
<cachi01|confused> wait wut
<cachi01|confused> wat
<Gold_Demona> cachi01|confused: Because sega was desperate to make new Sonic-related games for its newest system at the time so people would buy it?
<cachi01|confused> now im double confused .-.
<pony_5196> whoever made that pic, just won the internet
<cachi01|confused> dem g3 graphics :S
<cachi01|confused> Gold_Demona: .-.
<aniderp> nope... nothing else od intrest
<VenHur> cachi01|confused: I looked it up at EQD, recently, two new MLP books are going to be released soon, one of them was that picture I shown.
<cachi01|confused> .-.i just lost interest on the comics
<VenHur> cachi01|confused: Sooo...yeeeeaaah...Seaponies are canon now.
<Buytoast> are you still going on about that?
<Gold_Demona> I still don't understand how that's a bad thing...
<VenHur> cachi01|confused: The new Seaponies resides in an underwater kingdom called Aquastria, ruled by King Leo of the Cosmic Council, and Princess Celestia's cousin.
<cachi01|confused> Aquastria
<cachi01|confused> wut
<VenHur> Look it up, silly pony.
<aniderp> im not going in my brother room agaon..there might be something in there thats for me D:
<cachi01|confused> cosmic council
<cachi01|confused> wut
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Why were you in there in the first place? O_o
<pony_5196> oh damn, i just realized today is friday
<cachi01|confused> its friday morning!
<Gold_Demona> pony_5196: Eeyup
<Jmo> Pfft, it's Saturday.
<Jmo> Slow ass Americans.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<cachi01|confused> suddenly beatles?
<Gold_Demona> Oh Mojay
<VenHur> cachi01|confused: Search on Google and look up "MLP Under The Sparkling Sea", you'll see what I mean.
<Gold_Demona> Not suddenly. They've been on for a long time now. :D
<pony_5196> is wrek gonna straem ps2?
<Gold_Demona> pony_5196: Who knows?
<VenHur> Maybe Kingdom Hearts?
<pony_5196> meh, i stop following kingdom hearts after the 2nd game
<pony_5196> the storyline is too confusing now
<Jmo> ^
<Gold_Demona> Me too
<Gold_Demona> The storyline got full of itself is what happened
<pony_5196> they should have just came out with the 3rd one already
<Gold_Demona> Organization XIII got too popular
<pony_5196> like, how many diffrent side games on diffrent consoles can they make?
<Gold_Demona> Too many
<cachi01|confused> kingdom hearts <3
<VenHur> Look, I KNOW we all wanted Kingdom Hearts 3 to end this confusing storyline schnengian, but all the other games outisde of story aren't so bad...
<pony_5196> im surprised they havnt made one exclusive to facebook
<cachi01|confused> i need to get DDD
<cachi01|confused> and also BBS
<VenHur> The only problems is that all of them are on different handhelds!
<cachi01|confused> i havent played those .-.
<cachi01|confused> btw where the fuck do you download coded??? i've been searching for years for a download
<pony_5196> the only good side game imo is chain of memories
<cachi01|confused> implying 368/2 days wasnt good
<Gold_Demona> Chain of Memories was good storywise, but I didn't care for the card-battle game play style.
<pony_5196> it was alright, there just wasnt much from it you would need to follow the storyline
<cachi01|confused> i hated the battle system :S
<pony_5196> bbs is probly the most informitive out of all the current side games
<Gold_Demona> I haven't played any of the other side games. Just Chain of Memories.
<DaringDerpy> http://imgur.com/a/YQX11
<cachi01|confused> btw
<cachi01|confused> dream drop distance is not side game
<cachi01|confused> its like 2.5
<cachi01|confused> if you dont play it you wont get the story of 3
<cachi01|confused> fakin square enix releasing the remixes only in japan :I
<Gold_Demona> Kinda like how Chain of Memories was supposed to be 1.5?
<cachi01|confused> yep
<JRP2234|Zzz> welp its 3:40 am
<JRP2234|Zzz> what should i do
<cachi01|confused> JRP2234|Zzz: drink booze
<Gold_Demona> Go to bread
<cachi01|confused> JRP2234|Zzz: watch hentai?
<DaringDerpy> plant a tree
<cachi01|confused> while watching hentai
<cachi01|confused> welp g2g cya
<DaringDerpy> bye cachi01|confused
<VenHur> BBS > KH1 > CoM > 368/2 Days > KH2 > coded > DDD
<VenHur> And that's the Kingdom Hearts games in chronological order as of now.
<sugarponi872> hey bronies i just saw
<alexxm> what did you see sugarponi872
<sugarponi872> the box for my new tv!
<MadSurge> Grrr, stupid overheating laptop
<sugarponi872> I wouldn't spoil the new episode, would I? of course not, besides I might get banned
<Buytoast> what a crying shame that would be.
<MadSurge> sugarponi872: the less you say, the better it is. Some people like to walk in completely blind
<Blarg> morning again
<MadSurge> Hey Blarg :$
<Blarg> Hello, MadSurge
<Gold_Demona> hiyo Blarg
<aniderp> hm
*Blarg waves
<aniderp> Gold_Demona: you gonna make lunch for us today?
*Gold_Demona gives Blarg a muffin
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: I already had lunch. Munchin on an apple now. :D
<Blarg> oh my, a muffin!
<sugarponi872> cya guys gotta set up my new tc
<sugarponi872> *tv
<Gold_Demona> later sugarponi872
<Blarg> later
<aniderp> what was for lunch?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: leftovers of some strange chicken/broth/vegetable concotion I made earlier this week. :D
<Gold_Demona> concoction*
<Blarg> that sounds good
<Blarg> minus the strange
<aniderp> all gone?
<Gold_Demona> Blarg: It's only strange because I don't know what to call it. :P
<Gold_Demona> It's not really a soup or a stew, cuz there's not enough broth to be called that. =/
<Blarg> Gold: I see. o_o
<Gold_Demona> It's just some low sodium broth, an onion, a tomato, some minced garlic, a bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower and some chicken.
<aniderp> hot chicken?
<Gold_Demona> ...Define "hot"?
<Jmo> OH HOT BABY.
<Gold_Demona> I just had a package of skinless boneless thighs and cooked it in the concoction. =/
<Gold_Demona> minus most of the fat
<aniderp> chicken with hot sauce on it
<Gold_Demona> Oh no
<Gold_Demona> I didn't add hot sauce to it
<Gold_Demona> I like hot sauce on bbq wings. :>
<Gold_Demona> Which this wasn't
<aniderp> when i go to resaurant i say hot chicken and they know what i mean!
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates - November 30th
<aniderp> i point to the thing also sometimes hehe
<Gold_Demona> I've never heard if referred to as "hot chicken" so that threw me off. It's more specific where I come from. Hot wings.
<aniderp> bufallo chicken or whatever they call it
<aniderp> i call it hot chicken for some reason..
<Gold_Demona> Or buffalo wings
<Gold_Demona> It's still correct saying "chicken" instead of wings. It just threw me off. :P
<Gold_Demona> Cuz not all chicken is spicy.
<Blarg> I can just imagine: Bufallo chicken...but replace the buffalo sauce with ghost chili sauce :)
<Gold_Demona> And chicken itself can be eaten hot or cold.
<aniderp> i like bonless bufaloo chicken strips :>
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Marathons and Streams Today!
<aniderp> i like having cold (bufaloo strip) chicken
<aniderp> its good cold/hot
<Gold_Demona> And I mean temerature, not spiciness. :P
<SaveDerpy15> ...
<aniderp> i know
<SaveDerpy15> 6 hours T_T
<Gold_Demona> Until what?
<aniderp> movie
<Gold_Demona> heh
<SaveDerpy15> lol i gotta sleep for waiting
<Gold_Demona> I thought the movie was at 7
<Gold_Demona> That's 8 hours from now
<Gold_Demona> 7
<Gold_Demona> 7 hours
<aniderp> it is about 7 hours
<aniderp> not 6 silly person
<Blarg> 7 hours-ish
<otakon> dammit I have to go to work in 2 hours
<otakon> bugger
<Gold_Demona> 7 hours minus like 3 minutes.
<Gold_Demona> I'd say it's a little closer than "ish" :P
<Blarg> but "ish" rolls off the tongue better :P
<aniderp> can i have pizza rolls for lunch Gold_Demona ?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: If you have pizza rolls then sure. XD
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: I haven't any
<aniderp> yay!
<aniderp> i have pizza rolls!
<Gold_Demona> I'm trying to lay off the microwave stuff for lunch.
<aniderp> microwave here i comeee!
<aniderp> or there is lasgana downstairs
<Gold_Demona> I'm amazed I've been able to lay off of sodas. All my previous attempts have ended in catastrophic failure.
<aniderp> but i wanna eat in my room so.. pizza rolls it is
<aniderp> i drink mio energy -shot-
<Gold_Demona> Energy drinks are bad for you if you aren't active. =/
<aniderp> my problem right there
<aniderp> idk were rest is..
<aniderp> oh well i should lay off mio
<Gold_Demona> Just get the mio that isn't energy drink
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: D: why lay off sodas?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Not completely, but enough that I'm not drinking sodas all the time. I'm trying to make healthier consumption choices.
<Gold_Demona> For lunch anyway
<Gold_Demona> My previous regular lunches consisted of either ramen or microwave crap
<Gold_Demona> Plus tons of sodas throughout the day
<SaveDerpy15> im tired like someone spilled water all over mah face..
<otakon> holy shit they are going nuts
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Good thing I went back to swimming. Now I can burn off some of the sugar in a proactive way :$
<SaveDerpy15> lol
<SaveDerpy15> :D
<SaveDerpy15> :P
<Gold_Demona> I still drink sodas sometimes, but I don't keep a supply for myself at home anymore.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: And energy drinks are blech, way too sweet
<MadSurge> It feels like drinking bubblegum
<aniderp> guess what
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah Energy drinks are an acquired taste. My husband drinks them.
<pony29284> scootaloo butt
<Gold_Demona> But he works a rigorous hard labor job, so he needs the extra energy.
<aniderp> pizza rolls gonna explode! :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: well, he needs the extra energy :)
<Gold_Demona> I described the experience of Red Bull akin to drinking pixie stix.
<SaveDerpy15> 6_9 i think i gonna sleep T_T
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: what is that?
<Blarg> aniderp: Exploding pizza rolls aren't really a good thing :/
<aniderp> but
<Gold_Demona> It's a sugary powder candy.
<Gold_Demona> That comes in a paper tube
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: aaah
<aniderp> pixieeee
<pony29284> stix
<aniderp> i want a giant pixie stix
<aniderp> its plastic the big ones
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good morning everyone
<Blarg> it's been forever since I had a pixie stick
<Gold_Demona> I've never had a giant pixie stix, sadly
<aniderp> D:
<alexxm> how've you been TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Gold_Demona> Only the regular small ones in the paper tubes.
<SafariMonkey> I'm sorry, Wrek, that I disconnected like that. I had connection issues, and I got other stuff to do now.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek is here? O.o
<aniderp> what?
<Tobiwan> what is this=
<aniderp> i should start laundry
<Gold_Demona> Does anyone have a cure for writer's block? D:
<pony29284> o.O
<Blarg> Gold_Demona: If I had that, I'd be using it, myself ;A;
<Tobiwan> what is this
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona probably not, I just dropped out of PS2 without warning because my connection dropped.
<Tobiwan> beattles? Oo
<Tobiwan> WTF
<Gold_Demona> You got a problem with the Beatles, Tobiwan?
<Blarg> Tobiwan: Yes, the Beatles.
<Tobiwan> I want ponies
<Tobiwan> OUTSIDE of ponytime :|
<Gold_Demona> One does not simply ask for ponies when it's not time for ponies. >.>
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> alexxm uhmm good i guess and you ?
<Blarg> Besides
<Tobiwan> I want G 3.5 NOW
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Blarg> it's the Beatles, man!
<alexxm> i'm good TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Tobiwan> isn't this the my little pony 3.5 7/24 stream?
<Gold_Demona> Yes, that's it. :D
<VenHur> So does anyone here does not know that Seaponies are canon now?
<Gold_Demona> 24/7
<SafariMonkey> Nooooo! Whenever someone says that, if ponies are given they are the kind that make you wish you never asked!
<Tobiwan> I know
<Gold_Demona> A little fixated, aren't we VenHur? O_o
<Tobiwan> And the Beatles smoked weed right before metting the queen?
<VenHur> No really, G4 Seaponies are cannon...
<Tobiwan> I like them XD
<VenHur> You want proof, right?
<Gold_Demona> dat fixation
<SafariMonkey> VenHur: no...
<VenHur> Okay. :P
<Gold_Demona> Maybe I need to put my brain in the microwave so my creative juices quit acting like molasses.
<Gold_Demona> It works with honey...
<SafariMonkey> VenHur yes I want proof, because I didn't know...
<VenHur> SafariMonkey: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8G9Go7opQ84/ULhjTNQzQzI/AAAAAAABFUY/guO3GQkT50s/s1600/1.JPG
<Blarg> Gold_Demona: Just write the weirdest thing that pops up in your mind. That sometimes works for me

<MadSurge> Sumica: BUSTAH WOOFAH
<Chrysalis> Hai guys
<otakon> twilight_squirtle: it's the specific technique of asskicking is all it is
<BronyDarth> The strongest Martial arts is called "Roundhouse kick" It's faster than speed of light, meaning it weighs more than the universe can bear. Or atlest that's what Einsten said.

<Pegasister> dat music
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: sink as in somewhere the heat can go
<Chrysalis> otakon no

<FriendshipIsRarity> Tis song
<p4ngya> cause of death?
<Gold_Demona> LOL He knew it was a trick question
<Sumica> 00,10not sure if old video or stream stutter
<Gold_Demona> Sumica: Maybe it's both?
<Sumica> 00,10iirc it was a heart disorder
<Gold_Demona> Cuz the stream's been stuttering
<twilight_squirtle> i thought it was cancer
<CountDoofus> As I've heard, he just didn't feel so good, went to lie down, and died. Just like that.
<BronyDarth> Dude... The movie night starts at a Saturday, how is that possible?
<Sumica> 00,10ahhh Cerebral edema
<Chrysalis> BronyDarth time zones
<BronyDarth> Friday Movie night: In 5 hours, 50 minutes... Which is a Saturday.
<Canebridge> Theories go that he was poisened as he went to rest

<Pegasister> random turtle
*AJIsHaunter hugs twilight_squirtle :)
<Evil> Better than what's on Sky On
<Evil> One*
<otakon> a CANTONESE OPERA SINGER
*twilight_squirtle hugs AJIsHaunter :3
<Sumica> 00,10good thing we called it Bronystate and not Ponystate
<AJIsHaunter> BronyGoldIngot: We don't stream ponies all the time. The FAQ will explain everything.
<Pegasister> OJAHAJA
<Evil> I had to explain to my friend today why MLP isnt for kids
<SirGanjalf> Woah, i didn't know Bruce was born in the US
<BronyGoldIngot> You should've just said two words.
<Kammerjunk> That's not completely true, though.
<Evil> I explained how evil some people can be, how CMC tried to kill babs, how the Mane 6 had mental breakdowns
<BronyGoldIngot> 4, and chan.
<Kammerjunk> MLP is for kids. But that doesn't mean it isn't for mature people, either.
<Alchemist> good evening/afternoon
<Evil> Trixie is just mean
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, Alchemist. :)
<Evil> Is MLP even for kids anymore?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Alchemist :)
<Gold_Demona> They did not try to kill Babs
<AJIsHaunter> Yes, Evil.
<Evil> Do they make it with children in mind?
<otakon> lol Bruce the Dancer
<Alchemist> AJIsHaunter: are you the new manifestation of ASisawesome?
<Kammerjunk> Evil: Hasbro, or Studio B?
<Canebridge> It is, but it certainly is a lot more fun to watch if you understand the increasing amount of references in it
<SirGanjalf> Ip Man?
<Evil> Studio B
<AJIsHaunter> Alchemist: Yep.
<otakon> Evil: they made it with people in mind
<Evil> No shit
<Alchemist> AJIsHaunter: why the name change?
<BronyGoldIngot> 'MURICA
<AJIsHaunter> Alchemist: Long story. :D
<otakon> where he got into MORE fist fights
<Evil> Wasn't his son named Huang?
<Pegasister> cångfo
<otakon> no idea
<Evil> #gtareference
<otakon> man he'd STILL be around too if he hadn't suddenly died
<Kammerjunk> Evil: Well, I obviously can't speak for everyone working at Studio B, but from what I know, it's a real pleasure. They get (almost) complete artistic freedom, the way I hear it. So I'd say that it's ars gratia artis; art for art's sake.
<Evil> I see
<aniderp> i think his son is named brandon
<SirGanjalf> ^was
<twilight_squirtle> otakon: brilliant deduction :P
<Evil> was
<otakon> yeah he died too
<aniderp> his son died also?
<Evil> No
<SirGanjalf> His son died in an gunshot accident
<Evil> He became unborn
<otakon> got killed by a faulty gun
<Evil> Today I found out Abraham Lincoln has a living relative
<aniderp> thats sad :<
<Alchemist> gunshot accident? you mean murder?
<otakon> no
<SirGanjalf> Anyone heard about the movie "Crow"?
<otakon> it was a blank from a gun fired in a stunt
<Fl00t4sh41> otakon: The gun wasn't faulty, it wasn't supposed to be loaded with real bullets
<Alchemist> SirGanjalf: with brandon lee?
<SirGanjalf> Alchemist: Yes
<Alchemist> SirGanjalf: I love that movie
<otakon> Fl00t4sh41: it wasn't loaded with real bullets, it was a blank that malfunctioned
<Evil> Only in America
<Pegasister> BYE EVERYPONY. love ya. >_>
<Canebridge> Moving faster than the old man reacts.. Darn
<Alchemist> SirGanjalf: brandon was killed druring the filming of that movie
<otakon> lol he's flinching and Bruce never touched him ONCE
<SirGanjalf> That accident happened while making that movie
<CountDoofus> Later, Pegasister
<otakon> bye Pegasister take care
<SirGanjalf> ah
<otakon> looks good with a beard
<Evil> Hey it's my dad
<Scoot-Scootaloo> See ya later Yvonne! Yvonne see ya later! Okay okay iloveyou
<Evil> Is that batman
<otakon> no it's The Green Hornet
<Alchemist> SirGanjalf: I think it was the scene where he jumps on top of the table during the crime gang meeting and everyone starts shooting at him
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Kato from the Green Hornet
<Evil> Looks moore like spiderman
<otakon> but in the Green Hornet the butler/driver did ALL of the work
<Evil> Is that Los Angeles
<Evil> IS that Dan Lee
<otakon> probably
<otakon> he just said it was
<CountDoofus> Just out of curiousity, how long is this biography?
<pony_963> soooooooo slooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww
<Fl00t4sh41> otakon: Thats what butlers are usually paid for
<otakon> CountDoofus: probably just over an hour
<SirGanjalf> Alchemist: Yeah, it was at the beginning of the movie. (Filmed as last last though)
<Evil> Is that a gym
<otakon> Evil: are you gonna keep asking retorhical questions?
<Evil> Otakon: Do you know what a rhetorical question is?
<Evil> It's a question not intended for an answer. I'm not asking those questions, so-
<Evil> HEY ITS DAN LEE AGAIN
<otakon> ...
<otakon> so you're being caption obvious then?
<sugarponi872> hey bronies I just finished setting up my new TV and it is AWESOME!
<Gold_Demona> sugarponi872: Yay!
<Evil> IS Dan Lee related to Bruce Lee
<otakon> sugarponi872: nice
<otakon> Evil: no Lee is a common surname is all
<Evil> Ah
<Evil> Yeah I know 3 lees lol
<otakon> like Patel is a common Indian surname
<Evil> Stan Lee could be related to Bruce and Dan
<otakon> lol if only
<CountDoofus> Looks like EQD refused my latest comic... Darn.
<SirGanjalf> Lee is a quite common name, i think
<Evil> Is that Brandon
<otakon> CountDoofus: oh well maybe next time?
<Fl00t4sh41> CountDoofus: Link?
<otakon> Evil: ARE YOU DEAF!?

<Gold_Demona> SirGanjalf: Duh :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Genetically Superior, Baby!
<pony_7222> Bruce Lee is a GOD
<Fl00t4sh41> we need to have the green hornet series streamed some time
<pony_7222> If you ever read about what he could do in detail, you'd be amazed
<aniderp> chocolate rain
<Deacon2021> green hornet's a series?
<SirGanjalf> :O
*valoreins becomes water
<pony_7222> it was back in the old days
<otakon> oh GOd
<DocSane> Green Hornet was a series in the 1960s
*twilight_squirtle drinks valoreins
<Gold_Demona> From the same studio that brought us wham bam pow Batman. :D
<pony_7222> oh great more Skrillex. Why do ponyfans like this crap?
<aniderp> what year did he die in?
<Fl00t4sh41> Deacon: Not just a series, but it was a series with Bruce Lee doing kung fu
<Scoot-Scootaloo> pony_7222: EWWW Skrillex :|
<pony_7222> GREEEEEGRAAAGRMMRAWWWWRRR tHAT'S WHAT THIS "MUSIC" SOUNDS LIKE
<CountDoofus> pony_7222: just because you don't like Skrillex, doesn't mean nobody else can.
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<twilight_squirtle> if rap is called music, then dubstep definitely is
<DocSane> pony_7222: Because it's easy for a lone composer to make on his computer?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I don't hear any Skrillex here, do you guys hear any skrillex?
<pony_7222> NO BUT IT'S all PONYFANS SEEM TO L;ISTEN TO
<pony_7222> What about music with...I dunno, INSTRUMENTS?
<YokusaHHart> I just hear wubs
<twilight_squirtle> pony_7222: not at all
<AJIsHaunter> pony_7222: Implying everyone likes dubstep
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Well I don't see any Skrillex around these parts now! :P
<pony_7222> Sounds like TV feedback. Ugh.
<pony_7222> Well, whatever this is. It's awful.
<DocSane> pony_7222: Be fair. There's plenty of non-dubstep MLP-inspired music.
<twilight_squirtle> pony_7222: i love orchestral music, but i also like some dubstep
<CountDoofus> Oh yeah, so music like MandoPony and AcousticBrony, not a single brony likes. Legit.
<TrixieMuffin> you might want to listen to some Beatlesbrony then , theres something difrent for you
<Scoot-Scootaloo> No sir, no skrillex here, and thank you for sharing your opinion! I'm going to put it in this special box, my Opinion Box
<AJIsHaunter> That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it. Although, some people may not agree with your opinion.
<pony_7222> also, i don't get remixes. theyre never as good as the original song theyre mixed from
<pony_7222> ever
<twilight_squirtle> i like this song somewhat, although the lyrics are bleh
<AttackWithHugs> pony_7222, not eveyone like dubstep, not everyone likes rock/metal/alternative, etc
<valoreins> onions!
<YokusaHHart> I like prety much every genre, except modern pop and rap
<DocSane> I just wish it didn't sound like my speakers were blowing out.
<YokusaHHart> pretty*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I see you're still sharing your opinion! Let me just put it in my "Opinions Box"
<twilight_squirtle> pony_7222: yeah i think so too
<pony_7222> It just sounds like NOISE...like obnoxious feedback
<AJIsHaunter> I like some forms of dubstep, but that doesn't mean that I like ALL dubstep and that it's all I listen to.
<AJIsHaunter> I listen to a vast amount of other genres of music as well.
<pony_7222> sounds like throat singing gone way wrong
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Once again, my Opinion Box is filling up :$
<IGAF-kun> Streaming issues?
*twilight_squirtle sets Scoot-Scootaloo's opinion box on fire
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Thank you for making it less empty <3
<twilight_squirtle> wat timing
<valoreins> where's Gondor when we need more opinion boxes?
<YokusaHHart> Hold on, let me look for a F**k to give....
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I think everyone needs an Opinion Box. Someone should get an Opinion box~
<YokusaHHart> ....nope, nothing. Don't like it leave
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Mad Mares (Mad World Parody by Ember) / Swinga Da Plot / Pinki! Fun!!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Does anypony else want to share an Opinion Box?

<twilight_squirtle> bye Gold_Demona
<IGAF-kun> Ouch
<YokusaHHart> Scoot-Scootaloo: Silly scoots, you're not allowed an opinion on the internet, everyone must liekand dislike the sane thing :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> pony_7222: Please, tell me more so I can put it in my box~
<YokusaHHart> same*
<CountDoofus> See that icon with the loudspeaker on it? Click that and it will make the afwul noises go away.
<ZarnVlada> :D
<Kandarihu> By the way, Scoot-Scootaloo. I am VERY well aware that I'm not supposed to tell you what to stream or not to stream. Did you go ahead and stream the documentary on Woodstock already?
<otakon> is this still on?
<AJIsHaunter> Yep, otakon.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Not yet, but I will
<pony_7222> i just wonder why almost every ponyfan likes this type of music is all. I'm not telling you to change it.
<otakon> how long is this?
<ZarnVlada> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Kandarihu> otakon, it's a loop.
<otakon> oooooh
<ZarnVlada> that long
<otakon> god why couldn't we get PINKIE on loop
<IGAF-kun> THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<pony_7222> oh thank God
<AJIsHaunter> pony_7222: Not every pony fan likes dubstep. Take some people here for example
<Kandarihu> otakon, it's over

<AJIsHaunter> CountDoofus: Did they ever explain why?

<Fl00t4sh41> I learned that lesson the hard way
<Princessluna_tic> That's a pretty good rule
<CountDoofus> Eh, close enough.

<thebikergorilla> 10 mins :O
<waffleness> on netfrix
<KTKomedy2813> Now what the hell is this?
<AJIsHaunter> Someone posted this channel in mane chat?
<CountDoofus> Looks like Halo.
<CCharmanderK> It IS Halo.
<KTKomedy2813> Video game or full-length movie?
<CountDoofus> Never played it.
<AJIsHaunter> CountDoofus: I can. I like Winter. :3
<CCharmanderK> It's a film short.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Apparently this =/= movie
<Fl00t4sh41> So shooting the entire enemy fleet is an option?
<MLP_Brovakiin> I am playing it now :D
<Fl00t4sh41> Why are they sending in commandos?
<Deacon> from what I remember, Halo was pretty ok
<KingQball> yea...my fault....forgot about the join command
<Princessluna_tic> It's from the anime thing
<AJIsHaunter> Ah, I see.
<CCharmanderK> Halo is pretty awesome.
<CCharmanderK> It's no Battlefield, but it's pretty cool.
<CCharmanderK> MACROSS MISSILE MASSACRE!!
<AJIsHaunter> You're not the only who's done it, so don't worry about it.
<Fl00t4sh41> And why are their pilots of choice for space fighters ground soldiers?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Halo is a pretty cool guy
<CountDoofus> AJIsHaunter: I used to love it too, until I got a job that over 30 miles away, and driving through snow sucks.
<AJIsHaunter> CountDoofus: 30 miles? :O
<Fl00t4sh41> Don't they have actual pilots?
<KTKomedy2813> Eh, I'm more of a PlayStation guy... but the visuals here are nice.
<CountDoofus> Well, 50 kilometers.
<CCharmanderK> I <3 the original PlayStation.
<Deacon> me too <3
<CCharmanderK> Did I just hear Luci Christian?
<CCharmanderK> FUQ
<Fl00t4sh41> That plan
<Fl00t4sh41> Blow up a giant spaceship to kill a few enemy soldiers
<Fl00t4sh41> Perfect plan
<DeltaWing> I sent my freind this link cause he loves halo
<CCharmanderK> Who here likes playing the original Medal of Honor over modern agmes?
<Buytoast> what's this? Master Chief: The Animated Series?
<Etheren> The original spartans ftw
<KTKomedy2813> What's this Halo production's name?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Spartans never die
<DeltaWing> he told me to Buck off cause its pony halo
<DeltaWing> i LOLd
<Sandvichman> yay halo legends
<Buytoast> why would you send him a perversion of something he enjoys
<CCharmanderK> Yep, that's Luci Christian, alright.
<CountDoofus> Short-sighed much?
<Tovler> ugh. when you paint your face white, it really makes your teeth look yellow.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Buytoast: No, its a documentary on the future of the MURRIKAN Military
<RainbowDerpy> wat is this
<Buytoast> do you truly dislike your friend that much?
<Buytoast> ah
<Buytoast> I see
<Buytoast> Uncle Sam is smiling upon them
<CountDoofus> MURRIKAH!
<Fl00t4sh41> Also, why do their space fighters have wings for atmospheric flight?
<RainbowDerpy> wat is this that we're watching
<invaderdiz> I hav no idea
<Scoot-Scootaloo> RainbowDerpy: Master Chief: The Movie
<RainbowDerpy> hmm not very good
<Buytoast> how dare you
<CCharmanderK> You should air Odd One Out. It's the best Halo Legends short.
<Buytoast> you spit on MURIKA with your dislike
<Fl00t4sh41> Why do they have gun turrets on a 1 man fighter?
<CCharmanderK> Plus it's directed by the guy who directed Dragon Ball Z.
<Tovler> that Halo 4 movie that just came out?
<Buytoast> and that's worse than not paying for the super size
<Fl00t4sh41> Manually operated gun mounts at that
<CCharmanderK> I just heard Andrew Love.
<Buytoast> wait
<Buytoast> why is tehre a girl halo
<CCharmanderK> Buytoast: You don't know wanything about Halo, do you?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> That hud
<MadSurge> Ewww Halo
<Fl00t4sh41> Buytoast: a better question would be why she's wearing less armor then the men
<Buytoast> there's a big ring in sapce with a shit ton of water on it or somthing that floods the world
<KTKomedy2813> I'm here for the next MLP episode.
<MadSurge> Fl00t4sh41: fanservice, duh
<Buytoast> and halo goes there to kill the aliens and stop the water
<Buytoast> he does this three times
*Tovler google to figure out which one is Halo
<CountDoofus> Don't most women wear less armor than men in pretty much every game or show ever?
<Buytoast> except the third time has a robot
<Scoot-Scootaloo> MLP Episode? On MY Bronystate?
<CountDoofus> Ponies? What, are you one of those bronies or something?
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: I like those rare instances where they wear the same amount of armor :)
<Fl00t4sh41> Scoot-Scootaloo: plese don't
<Shano> omgomgomg
<Buytoast> but last time i checked, the only girl in halo was the hologramic purple data eater
<CCharmanderK> It's more likely tha you think
<CountDoofus> MadSurge: http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20070922
<Nyst> Are they Klingons now?
<CCharmanderK> Buytoast: You mean Cortana?
<Dj-pon3> what is this?
<Fl00t4sh41> So the covenants cheif weapon is blowing up their own ships to kill everything inside?
<Buytoast> oh wow, Bum Tickely's Words the Series
<Dj-pon3> theres a halo movie?
<Deacon|FF3> Dj-pon3 it was animated iirc
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: that doesn't count, in Soulcalibur noone loses limbs :D
<CCharmanderK> Dj-pon3: There's a series of Halo shorts called Halo Legends.
<pony_1884> Master Chief?:O
<Dj-pon3> whow
<Dj-pon3> kool
<CCharmanderK> The CG here is fantastic.
<Buytoast> woah now, why is Cotrana blonde
<Nyst> Huh, you'd think it'd be easier for him to just carry the entire pod.
<Buytoast> and solid
<Tovler> Title Drop
<Tovler> wait, this isn't One Piece
<CCharmanderK> Tovler: LOL.
<CCharmanderK> Silly Grunt.
<Fl00t4sh41> He arms his opponent before fighting him?
<Fl00t4sh41> Why?
<Buytoast> honor
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Honorable duel?
<Dj-pon3> honor
<Nyst> It's an honor thing.
<Afflict> hey spyrofan
<Shizuka> 13i love how people show up 19 hours early for the episode
<Nyst> They're Klingons.
<Buytoast> it's MURIKA'S greatest asset
<Fl00t4sh41> Cheif has killed thousands without a blade
<Nyst> Oh I'm here most every day.
<CountDoofus> Shizuka: episode of what? <_< >_>
<CCharmanderK> Fl00t4sh41: It's called "honor".
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Shizuka: It seems that SOMEPONIES want to see some Ponies early... Shall I do the honors? >: D
<Fl00t4sh41> CCharmanderK: Sounds like stupidity to me
<CCharmanderK> A THOUSAND HELLS AWAIT YOU!!!
<Buytoast> yes Scoot-Scootaloo
<Buytoast> fulfill the prophecy
<CountDoofus> Scoot-Scootaloo: inb4 sea- or not-G4 ponies.
<CCharmanderK> Shinji Aramaki is a fantastic director.

<AJIsHaunter> cowvarkian: The hijack on Mips means we can't use it anymore for streams.
<thelonecubone> welp brb, gonna leave for a bit
<AJIsHaunter> Bye, thelonecubone. :3
<cowvarkian> AJIsHaunter: I know that, but mips wasn't a very good streaming service anyways
<thelonecubone> gonna use my home computer :3
<AJIsHaunter> True, but I didn't mind Mips.
<Fl00t4sh41> mips was hijacked?
<Deacon> I kinda like veemi now, it has support for 16:9
<Tovler> I forgot what we used to use before mips.
<AlienWarhead> Fl00t4sh41: Last Saturday during the new episode
<Fl00t4sh41> AlienWarhead: I wasn't here at the time
<Fl00t4sh41> what happened?
<cowvarkian> an orange with legs
<Worgeral1> worst that happened
<cowvarkian> and arms
<AdamThePsyduck> Fl00t4sh41, http://imgur.com/sKnw1
<AJIsHaunter> What I liked about Mips was that you didn't have to manually restart the stream for the player. It would do that by itself most of the tme.
<AJIsHaunter> *time
<Worgeral1> lol
<AlienWarhead> Fl00t4sh41: We were hacked twice for a few minutes
<AdamThePsyduck> Remember, 11/24/12
<Fl00t4sh41> Sorry I missed it
<cowvarkian> AdamThePsyduck: I don't think I will
<Deacon> eh, 1/1/12 was more trajic
<AdamThePsyduck> I wasn't there at the time ;~;
<Kandarihu> Deacon, what happened then?

<Deacon> yea, someone let loose some bots in the chat, and cause the chatroom to be spammed with multiple post
<Pinkies_imagination> *Gets swamped by TF2 players* 'Blerg'
<AJIsHaunter> Deacon: Was it anything offensive?
<CCharmanderK> Now I'm listening to Roundabout. :)
<Deacon> AJIsHaunter nah it repeated whoever talked last, and did that for 10 times
*cowvarkian wishes he didnt have to kill the forsworn in skyrim... and the necromancers...
<Deacon> in a row
<Worgeral1> FIGHT
<AJIsHaunter> CCharmanderK: A roundabout! I'll steal it! NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW!
<cowvarkian> because blood works like that, right
<pony_216917> Holy crap thats alot of blood.
<Nyst> He's so a samurai.
<CCharmanderK> AJIsHounter: Lol
*AlienWarhead wishes saving the forsworn leader was meaning
<cowvarkian> ikr

<AlienWarhead> meaningful:P
<CCharmanderK> AJIsHaunter: Dover Boys, duh.

<RainbowDerpy> NO
<BlackRose> ponies!
<Canadian_Brony> cowvarkian Electronic Dance Music. It's like dubstep, but good. And no, it's not Skrillex; I'm listening to Klaypex.
<AJIsHaunter> Let's watch whatever Scoot-Scootaloo feels like streaming.
<RainbowDerpy> NO
<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: I know
<Lunac> Is this like the HALo games? A really good basic intro then just new locations each new episode?
<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: I was joking

<RainbowDerpy> COMW BACK

<Deacon> it was something special alright
*WingedWolf eats my donuts
<HyperRandom> NOPE! *springs away*
<RainbowDerpy> GOD DAMMIT WINGED
<RainbowDerpy> NOT AGAIN
<DarkColt> Each of these were done by a different animation studio, and lumped together. Each is its own story, but within the Hal universe, Lunac.
<YokusaHHart> Spartans are OP
<AJIsHaunter> Agreed. :D
<RainbowDerpy> *fucks WingedWolf's shit up*
<Pinkies_imagination> *Btings in more donuts* WHO WANT?

<pony_216917> Thats my favorite one.
*WingedWolf uses magic and uses super life
<LyraHeartstrings> we should watch angel beats ep 2 :)
<RainbowDerpy> *kicks his dead body

<Pinkies_imagination> *Uses iner pinkie to magicly walk away with dash's donuts*
<RainbowDerpy> OH FUCK
<pony_216917> Damnit.
<RainbowDerpy> *runs away
<DarkColt> pony_216917 : not sure. I think that's like, amongst the first few episode
<Canadian_Brony> KTKomedy2813 the two most important rules of BronyState: NEVER COMPLAIN ABOUT THE STREAM and NEVER REQUEST PONIES. Both will get us G3.6, which no one likes.
<AJIsHaunter> MadSurge: She'll grow up to be a great carpenter one day. :3
<Babsy> *except the knife was a twinkie*
<Nightlock> Hello everypony ^^
<pony_1059> halo

<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: so, what about never RP
<MadSurge> Who said women can't be good carpenters?
<RainbowDerpy> Wolf if u help me ill split the donuts 50-50 deal
<DarkColt> Chasing Pinkie's imagination is like trying to talk without a throat or a diaphram X_X
<WingedWolf> with what..
<Pinkies_imagination> *Gets tackled* What are you doing? *Dash see's she tackled a cardboard cutout of me* Haha.... *Walks away again*
<KTKomedy2813> You forgot to mention "NEVER CONSTANTLY SAY GAK".
<Canadian_Brony> cowvarkian that's less important because we're allowed some wiggleroom on that.
<HyperRandom> Am I the only one here actually watching the episode and NOT going crazy in the comments?
<RainbowDerpy> Pinkie's imagination stole my donuts!

<Fl00t4sh41> So, why don't they just nuke infected planets from orbit instead of sending infectable soldiers down to shoot at the flood?
<Lunac> No Tucke;rs hybrid son brought about peace you worthless anime
<Winterwolf00> As was earlier said. The only thing that can unite Humanity is a common enemy. Perhaps thats true for all life.
<thelonecubone|BL2> ayejay is right, shaggy :3
<shaggy> good so no pony over loads
<shaggy> i like it
<mishia> shaggy: the concept is we all sit in a theater, with main 6 in front, pegasi up top, Ops and owners in best seats, unicorns with crystals, and main area earth ponies.
<grayhoof> Hi guys! First time in a few weeks! Finally got settled into new house. Hows your day going?
<DashWithRainbows> Planet could still have life on there that isn't infected, Fl00t4sh41
<AJIsHaunter> All we need is a Scooby. :D
<thelonecubone|BL2> AJIsHaunter: :D
<DashWithRainbows> Sentient life for that matter
<AJIsHaunter> Good, grayhoof? How about you? :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> S'all good, grayhoof!
<Fl00t4sh41> DashWithRainbows: How long will it remain uninfected?
<The_Great_Trixie> :D
<mishia> I mean, As a earthpony, I lay on hay like a normal pony...not like lyra >_>
<shaggy> mishia, i can't begin to even try to understand that
<thelonecubone|BL2> Hi grayhoof, just playing Borderlands 2 :3
<Winterwolf00> Anyone else thinking Eldritch Abominations?
<Fl00t4sh41> DashWithRainbows: and now will bullets remove the infection?
<RainbowDerpy> Pegasi are best pony
<Worgeral> then allways makes me think are we really alone in the galaxy
<AJIsHaunter> All pony races are best pony. :3
<Ponyswag> ^
<grayhoof> AJisHaunter its all going good glad to hear that
<DashWithRainbows> Fl00t4sh41 Kill the infected form = kills the body.

<killerpony7733> Dat forerunner helmet
<pony_6965> gravemind :o
<grayhoof> Scoot-Scootaloo thats always good ^.^
<DashWithRainbows> Another infected form can take over the body if it is still able to be used in combat
<Alchemist> Im already praying for your souls because of today's B movie
<shaggy> no flood is best pony race
<Winterwolf00> *Sees a single infection form* Burn the whole fucking planet.
<Fl00t4sh41> DashWithRainbows: But the flood infects like a virus, its not just the big ones you need to worry about
<Nyst> Bull. Secrets exist to be known.
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> I have an untouchable secret.
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> =D
<DashWithRainbows> Infected forms are the small ones.
<pony_6965> wats that
<Lunac> ...

<Winterwolf00> Knowledge is power.
<Fl00t4sh41> DashWithRainbows: its the ones the size of fungal spores and viri you need to worry about
<DashWithRainbows> Infection*
<AJIsHaunter> Barb|MyLilPseudonym: So you have a secret that will never die? :3

<grayhoof> thelonecubone|Bl2 Ive been meaning to get Borderlands, then steam sale and I splurged on other cheaper games
<Nightlock> Please ^^
<mishia> shaggy: Pegasi lay on cloud seats, Draconqui(1 in existance) sit wherever, Alicorns (horn and wings) in front with the main 6 ponies. The ops sit in special areas. Unicorns on feather seats, and crystal ponies (earthpony subspecies) sit in crystal. the bat ponies sit upsidedown/in darker areas.
<pony_6965> CORTANA WANTS CHIEF'S D!
<shaggy> is this a tv show or a movie?

<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Fun fact, his proposed increase on upper-class tax rates are nowhere near as high as the tax rate during the Reagan years.
<wipergone2> :P
<DocSane> Kandarihu: That's kind of the basis of a progressive tax code, as it's been in existence since the income tax was introduced.
<Michael> hai Thunderlane343

<FlutterSAUR> Kurra: CAPTAIN SPARKLES DAMN YOU
<PrincessLuna> so first app install on my new phone is the mlp game..
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, the fairest tax code is a flat tax. That way, everyone pays the same proportion of their taxes and nobody gets punished for making more money.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Cause baby toniight, the creepers trying to steal all our stuff agaain~
<Worgeral> eyes
<Meanwhile> ThunderBreeze: No non image links while a stream's on.
<AJIsHaunter> ThunderBreeze: No video links during a stream.
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Please show me some evidence of mass nationalization of industries, seizure of private property for the state, and a centrally planned economy.
<Tomothy> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Kurra> FlutterSAUR: what??

<cachi01|ProjDIVA> AssaultWithEmbraces: no
<Vordox> AssaultWithEmbraces: O.o
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: so, paying more taxes so the federal government can actually support itself, if punishment?
<Ralathon> Shame the sun doesnt hurt creepers
<Record_Discord> Cuz baby to niiiiiiiiiiiiight
<Tomothy> UGH
<ThunderBreeze> 9_6 My bad
<cowvarkian> *is
<DocSane> Kandarihu: No, flat tax punishes the poor way more than the wealthy.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Vordox, cachi01|ProjDIVA: Whaaa? I can't sing in chat?
<CrystalPhoenix> Thunderlane343, oh that's nice, it's a shame that it's against the rules to post videos during stream :3
<Fl00t4sh41> Thatsss a very nice everything you have there.
<Fl00t4sh41> tsssssssssssssssssss
<Record_Discord> I can say that I sort of genuinely kind of enjoy this song
<Vordox> AssaultWithEmbraces: I'm suprised you know the lyrics
<shaggy> shout out to captiansparkles
<DocSane> Kandarihu: They have far less disposible income.
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> only song i like from captain sparkles is fallen kingdom
<Record_Discord> I like "Screw the Nether" better
<Worgeral> shout out to all those who play minecraft
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> cause its the only good song parody
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Vordox of course. I got it on my phone <3 My niece knows the chorus though

<CrystalPhoenix> this song is shitty
<Thunderlane343> Crystalphoenix um i didnt post a video up

<Vordox> I like Dynamite imo :P
<String_Shredder> mlg pro
<AssaultWithEmbraces> cachi01|ProjDIVA pffft :3
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> CrystalPhoenix: indeed
<CrystalPhoenix> Thunderlane343, it seems I have mistabbed
<CrystalPhoenix> sorry
<Deacon> house still smells like paint, dog still in my room, -_-
<Record_Discord> cachi01|ProjDiva: It's Moves like Jagger, but the parody is fantastic
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> Record_Discord: then no thx
<AssaultWithEmbraces> So fight fight, like it's the last last night of your life, show them yourr bite
<Record_Discord> cachi01|ProjDiva: Whatever bro, just thought you might like it
<Thunderlane343> Crystalphoenix its ok it happens
<shaggy> are we doing minecraft stuff now?
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> Record_Discord: nope parodies of bad songs are also bad songs
<coinflip2> sparta kick
<thegt90> i love the second one they did it was awesome
<Record_Discord> cachi01|ProjDIVA: Don't knock it until you try it
<DocSane> Kandarihu: In any case, claiming that Obama is "a Marxist" for wanting to reset tax rates to 90's levels for 2% of the population.
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> Record_Discord: its still the same shitty song with different lyrics
<cowvarkian> cachi01|ProjDIVA: so, would that make nearly every wierd al song also bad?
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> unless its weird al
<Deacon> cachi01|ProjDIVA yea.
<Kandarihu> DocSane, Benjamin Franklin once said that the best thing to handle poverty is to make the poor uncomfortable in their poverty. A flat tax is much fairer than a system that steals most of the wealth from the people who's efforts and leadership in the private sector have built the foundations of society, and give it to the people who do nothing to earn it.
<Record_Discord> Deacon: What about screw the nether T~T
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Cool Story, Bro
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Sorry. Premature return. In any case, it's absurd.
<Tomothy> gaben
<Deacon> Record_Discord meh
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> dat text
<shaggy> hey, no arguing
<waffleness> why are we talking about politics?
<Record_Discord> Deacon: D:
<shaggy> its annoying
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> waffleness: cause we are politicstate
<shaggy> i would know
<shaggy> lol
<Deacon> I don't really like modern pop music as much as the next person
<cowvarkian> waffleness: because we are
<DocSane> Kandarihu: False premise: that the poor are lazy who do nothing to earn a living.
<pony_322487> How was I supossed to know we were both related? Believe me if I knew she was my cousin we never would have dated :P
<Buytoast> That's nice and all Kandarihu, but uncle Sam said "Let there be light and freedom."
<Ralathon> Because politics are one of the fundamental pillars of our society and ignoring them would be bad for humanity in general?
<Tobiwan> :D
<CrystalPhoenix> oh boy
<Worgeral> huh?
<CrystalPhoenix> here we go
<Tomothy> yes
<cowvarkian> DocSane: because apparently having like, 4 jobs means you're lazy
<Caldemeyen> Wut
<Caldemeyen> xD
<KingQball> welp...i just bought the humble indie bundle....
<Michael> roar
<Thunderlane343> oh god its rated F!!
<Tomothy> just yes
<Vordox> Friendship is Gic?
<StinkomanFan> Pones <3
<CriticKitten> Ah yes, because if they're poor, naturally they're poor because they just don't WANT it enough.
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> YAY :D
<Caldemeyen> ANOTHER POOP
<Caldemeyen> XD
<CriticKitten> >_>
<DocSane> Kandarihu: The poor are often stuck in low-apying jobs and work far more hours than the wealthy.
<Pale_Horse> RAWR! :O
<Nightlock> W00t
<Java> Like saying that getting out of poverty is wasy.
<Kandarihu> waffleness, because during the Metal Wolf Chaos video, someone talked about Obama as a hero.
<Record_Discord> Deacon: Well, fair fair, neither do I, but that's because of people unable to come up with good lyrics OR good notes.
<pony_322487> PAPER MARIO FTW

<Buytoast> Ah yes, the Hammer.
<DocSane> Kandarihu: The myth of the lazy poor is just that: a myth.
<AJIsHaunter> DAT HAMMER
<Kandarihu> DocSane, the only truly toxic element in an economy is the government, and even though it hardly started with Obama, he's made it worse since he took office.
<Deacon> Record_Discord same here
<pony_322487> LOL
<Buytoast> One of Uncle Sam's greatest inventions.
<shaggy> or was it donkey kong
<coinflip2> dat stare
<pony_322487> yay
<Kandarihu> Buytoast.....
<Nightlock> woah.
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Not creeping corporate thievery?
<AJIsHaunter> Twilight Princess?
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: no, somebody wondered facetiously if obama might save us in that same situation
<Deacon> Quick, angel needs a gold needle
<Buytoast> You bite your tongue.
<Thunderlane343> rotation cloud!!
<Michael> wat
