<SpadeMagnes[School]> John Madden
<Vivix> Johann Mädden, the swedish version
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7TKlxYxVL0 I dont know why but I like this remix of Pyramid Cave from Sonic Adventure 2
<Wrek> 05Zlatan ibrahimovic
<Vivix> Footballer, right?
<The_Engineer> Hey everybody :)
<Vordox> Wrek: DAT guy. eh
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai The_Engineer :)
<Wrek> 05big nose, speaks with his mouth closed
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh here comes another chinese earthquake
<Wrek> 05good guy though
<Vivix> Haha
<Vordox> Wrek: Haven't met him
<Vordox> Also, I like this Battle Theme for Sombra http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO1FdPXlsWw&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&feature=mh_lolz
<Vordox> Mind doing a Sombra drawing, Wrek? =3
<Vordox> Something awesome, yet feared
<thelonepony> Hi The_Engineer :)
<Wrek> 05yes i do mind infact
<Vordox> Mind do or mind not do? ;)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why do I keep thinking of Sombreo when I hear Sombra
<naturesfury> i had a thought for a drawing today 2 for u
<Wrek> 05i wont draw sombrero untill hes worthy
<Wrek> 05chrysalis was worthy
<Wrek> 05(im talkign design wise)
<Chrysalis> hmmm??
<Wrek> 05talkign villains
<SpadeMagnes[School]> All hail Chrysalis and the changling nation *salutes*
<Chrysalis> ah bad guy discussion
<Vivix> Draw her with insect skin rather than fur
<Vordox> Woot, Sombra was bad
<Vordox> ?Å
<Vivix> Design wise, he was messy
<naturesfury> sense christmas is coming i was think maby having celestia in a sleigh with the main 6 pulling it with luna as rouhdolph?
<Vivix> but I've seen some reaaaallyy good drawings of him, that make him beautiful
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ponyville seems to get less and less a nice place to live each season
<Dark_Horst> didnt they say sombra was supposed to be the sauron type? "evil, you dont nee dto know why"
<Dark_Horst> but hey, i've seen things that make be believe he will be back
<Vivix> same, the horn
<Vivix> but also, Jim Miller voiced him, so that makes me think he won't
<otakon> Dark_Horst: not really
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hopefully Sombra improves his vocabulary if he comes back
<otakon> But he seems like the typical evil overlord type
<naturesfury> SpadeMagnes[School]: wha? he said 4 words
<otakon> Enslave the masses, rule with an iron hoof
<otakon> that sort of thing
<RaveBrony> :L
<SpadeMagnes[School]> All I remeber was him going on about crystals,slaves and grahahaha
<otakon> Or maybe it's crystal hoof in this case...
<RaveBrony> Hah
<Dark_Horst> otakon: there was a vector of trixie with a suspicious looking necklace. i suspect t was from that preview they had thrown out at some poiun t
<TrixieMuffins> he was voiced ? oh yeah , grrr , muhaha , crystaly , thats mine ..... did i miss any ?
<Dark_Horst> screenshots, i beleive it was
<Dark_Horst> or a clip
<otakon> Dark_Horst: O_o
<Vivix> Don't talk about unaired episodes
<Dark_Horst> i do not know
<Vivix> ever
<otakon> Dark_Horst: SHHHH!
<Vivix> it is a ban-reason
<otakon> seriously!
<naturesfury> TrixieMuffins: ahh my slaves
<Dark_Horst> otakon: you wont get more out of me then that
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So is Gyrobowl no longer our god here?
<otakon> THANK GOD!
<Dark_Horst> but yeah, i beleive we will see him again. or his influence
<otakon> I wonder if Paddlin' is stil in effect?
<Dark_Horst> mmight be wishful thinking
<Dark_Horst> but a man can hope
<Wrek> 05ahem
<Wrek> 05ill let that slip
<Everlasting_Joy> Hi again folks!
<otakon> Someone type the forbidden word
<Wrek> 05but

<otakon> HE KNOWS!
<Wrek> 05S2 UNAIRED STUFF
<Wrek> 05EVER
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Everlasting_Joy :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Do I even want to know what other anchient evils are in equestria?
<Vivix> THREE
<otakon> and it's S3!
<Wrek> 05S3'
<RaveBrony> Ty
<Vivix> yes, seriously, noone mention previews, songs, names, anything-
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: well remember Taurtaros?
<Sumica> 00,10but will I?
<RaveBrony> Dun dun duunnnn
<otakon> Sumica: will you?
<Wrek> 05sumica is a real hardass
<Wrek> 05with nice tits...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> We've had a Dark Goddes of the Moon, a God of Chaos, A changlign invasion, and a evil slave master
<otakon> ...
<Wrek> 05ahem*
<naturesfury> dear lord
<wipergone2> lol
<Vordox> Wrek: O.o
<otakon> Wrek he's a GUY
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I will cause I dont want to read up for it
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<Dark_Horst> i stay clear of spoilers like the plague myself
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Do I even want to know what other shit will break loose
<Dark_Horst> but that one screnshot got the drop on me
<Dark_Horst> sneaky bastard
<TrixieMuffins> id like to see some more Blackmagic-Celestia personally
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: well the next is gonna have to be a Military Dictator bent on conquest
<Sumica> 00,10if I have nice tit's it's cause you made them that way =p
<Vivix> Blackmagic Celestia was awesome
<otakon> I say some Griffin Warlord
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also Can Celestia go ONE villian premere with out failing
<Wrek> 05>casue you made them that way
<otakon> Sumica: Horses don't have tits :P
<Wrek> 05>I AM GOD
<Vivix> Wrek, the tit-god
<RaveBrony> Lmao
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God damn it celestia...I hate you sometimes
*Everlasting_Joy facehoofs.
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: um she didn't even DO anything, probably stayed back in case Twi and the gang failed
<Sumica> 00,10two point ooooooooooooh
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would enjoy if Celestia actually did something in a season to help
<Vivix> I think both Luna and Celestia stayed back to see what would happen
<otakon> Although WHY they didn't bring the EoH witht hem is BEYOND me
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: how did she fail with sombra?
<RaveBrony> I still want a Luna and Celestia ep :'(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Instead of sitting on her flank and doing jack shit
<Vivix> Well it was explained in this case
<otakon> Seriously WHY DIDN'T THEY TAKE THE MOST POWERFUL MAGIC ITEMS IN EQUESTRIA WITH THEM?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im pretty sure she got mind controlled
<Sumica> 00,10http://tinyurl.com/cv9qh59
<otakon> EoH would have floored Sombra in the opening act
<Vivix> besides- she's basically a goddess, why should she bother with things she don't have to do?
<Dark_Horst> otakon: becasue reasosn
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well its her fucking kingdom
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Shouldent she defend it?
<otakon> Sumica: ah, Professional Wife Toss; My FAVORITE EVENT!
<Vivix> She tried once, and she did once before
<RaveBrony> Sumica: I laugh everytime i see that :D
<Dark_Horst> otakon: remmeber how they said twilight had to face it alone, since that was her test. that alone renders the elements useless. you need all 6
<Vivix> but with Twilight, she wanted to test her
<Vordox> Element of Harmony would NOT work on Sombra
<Sumica> 00,10nah EoH would have just you know turned him in to a foal and fan faavoret charicter
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: ah the fine sport of Epic Wife Tossing
<Vivix> yeah~~ that's true Dark_Horst
<Vordox> Fyi
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im getting tired of Celestia gettign Twilight to do all the work for her
<Vivix> I'm not, but hey, I am a total Celestia nut
<Dark_Horst> otakon: also, in the end the keyrole was cadance, who finally got her assigned role by kicking him out
<SpadeMagnes[School]> She didnt do anything to help with Discord, she got utterly beaten with Chrysalis
<Dark_Horst> no elements rewuired
<otakon> lol I guess
<Dark_Horst> *required
<Sumica> 00,10it's like freelancer all over again
<Vivix> EoH might only work on some cases too
<Sumica> 00,10just instead of "trent you go first"
<otakon> Sumica: lol inb4 Foal Sombra pics pop up
<Wrek> 05why cant it jsut be celestia doign some really powerful shit agaisnt a realyl powerful foe
<Wrek> 05actualyl doing shit
<RaveBrony> PS2 is almost done installinggggg
<Sumica> 00,10it's Twilight you must face this alone"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Whats the point of having the elements of harmony if they never use them now?
<otakon> ^
<Wrek> 05and twilight needs to fix this otehr stuff kreepign up behind them
<Vordox> Wrek: She did to Sombra...
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: i ask that myself all the time
<Vivix> I'd like to see Celestia flaunt her power, but S3 premiere said why she didn't
<otakon> yeah if you notice they USED the EoH against Sombra the first time actually
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: yeha, but those are all past events
<Ryunosuke> oh geeze sumica, Juni was the least helpful pilot I have ever seen
<Dark_Horst> we wanna see some up to date magic whooping
<otakon> and considering turning him to shadow didn't seem to affect his powers that much
<TrixieMuffins> Speculation : The Elements were so far used to a) stop NMM , b)stop Discord , they kinda "fix" things that are corrupted or upset the natural order . Sombra was just an evil guy , dont think the elements would have worked on him.
<Sumica> 00,10and then we all remember it's a kids show
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The elements of harmony are just usless rocks now
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<naturesfury> shhhhh hush you
<RaveBrony> Sumica: Exactly
<Vivix> TrixieMuffins, also a good point
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: They stilled happened :P
<Everlasting_Joy> I was upping Sumica's comment.
<otakon> TrixieMuffins: they used them on him before to turn him to shadow remember?
<RaveBrony> I know
<Dark_Horst> true
<Wrek> 05kids show or not, i like coffee.
<Lasharus> And I can only agree with you, Everlasting_Joy.
<otakon> At least I think they did
<Vordox> Vivix: My point was the same before
<Vordox> ._.
<Vivix> otakon, really? I have to rewatch it again
<Sumica> 00,10I like trains
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also Twilight must do it alone? What about her 5 friends?
*Vordox waves his hand, since noone listens. :P
<LadyCanary> Choo choo
<Vivix> Oh sorry Vordox, didn't see I think
<otakon> Vivix: well it's CLEARLY Luna and Tia blasting Sombra into shadow.
<otakon> hiya Vordox
*Lasharus slaps Vordox back down.
<Vivix> yes
<Lasharus> Sit down, whoever you are.
<otakon> Sumica: I HATE TRAINS!
<Sumica> 00,10and on the note of freelancer all the battle ships in that game sucked
<Vordox> Hai and ai
<Vivix> but with the EoH or without them?
<LadyCanary> And this is why you need to replace your blood with coffee Wreky
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What about the whole friendship crap you've been getting twilight to learn? is that pointless now?
*otakon crushes a train with his mind.
<otakon> Vivix: maybe without
<Sumica> 00,10they had so many blind spots for fighteres to park in
*Deacon wonders why he is playing a 12 year old game
<TrixieMuffins> otakon: i dont , i may have to rewatch the episode , i only saw Celestia and Luna touch horns and defeat him , didnt notice the elements in that
<Lil_B> Well Vordox I took the first Steps towords the Walk cycle :( ... or rather a run-cycle
<Lasharus> Because the age of a game doesn't denote its quality, Deacon.
<otakon> Deacon: bc ot
<Vivix> I think it was without too
<Vordox> Lil_B: Use the template
<otakon> s AWESOME!
<Vivix> giving is some taste of badass princesses
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So if Celestia made twilight do this alone, why bother have her learn about friend ship?
<Vivix> that makes no sense
<Vivix> Friendship is something she has to learn, same with the EoH
<Vivix> this was another test
<Lil_B> Vordox I do, but I can't do much more than have it next to it and try to resprite her so she looks like the template
<Deacon> because overspeculations?
<Sumica> 00,10She realise twilight was carrying the rest of the group
<Alchemist> Im DLing Planetside 2. Is it any good?
<Vordox> Ah try that Lil_B
<Vivix> They are doing somtehing with Twilight
<Sumica> 00,10secretly they all got solo asignments
<Vivix> the whole premiere feels like it's setting things up
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well yea...Twilight is the only one who does the fuckign work
<otakon> eeyup
<Vivix> we probably will see waht is going on during this season
<otakon> plus the whole Infinity symbol
<Vivix> yeah
<otakon> Her being "ready"
<Vivix> and Luna's words-
<otakon> and the GODDAMN HORSES!
<Wrek> 05im still waitign for crackle to show that there is no more powerful entity ever
<Vivix> that's why I loved the premiere, my little nerd went crazy with joy
<otakon> Seriously what's with the horses?
<Alchemist> Vivix: like in S1, first ep (apart from the pilot) is about the gala and so is the season final?
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> we might see some arch like that-
<Vivix> it feels like it at least
<Deacon> otakon maybe foreigners?
<otakon> Arabian style horses visit Equestria
<otakon> probably
<naturesfury> i waiting for spike to grow huge hair(spikes) and start glowing with power while yelling at the top of his lungs
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' everyone. :)
<Sumica> 00,10forget the horses I want more early gen throwbacks
<Vivix> Haha
<MadSurge> ^
<Sumica> 00,10where are my fucking sea ponies
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also what was Sombra's obsesseon with stairs?
<otakon> Sumica: lol CRAZY FACE!
*Lil_B licks AdamTheDuck
<Ryunosuke> lol Sumica
*AdamTheDuck noms on Lil_B :P
<Vivix> SpadeMagnes[School], he had a love affair with a slinky
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sumica: Fun fact, Faust wanted to make a sea ponies episode, but it never got made
*Lil_B is nommed on
<RaveBrony> There has GOT to be seaponies at Some point
<Vivix> Maybe there will be
<MadSurge> Sumica: Cherilee and Scootaloo meet their G3 counterparts :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So we almost had one
<otakon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8NaesRxxck
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[School] I guess there are many never-done Episode concepts by Faust and the others... We need a lost MLP-Files Show
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also pinkie has the secret of hands now
<otakon> One of the top comments is
<Vivix> Crippleloo
<Chrysalis> Sumica ikr, this season needs more sea ponies
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Lyra must be sad
<otakon> "I think the animators are fucking with us..."
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Vivix> I think the Pinkie Clones could morph slightly, hands and faces
<Everlasting_Joy> I think they are otakon.
<Vivix> I don't think Pinkie can
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would be damned if the animators werent screwing with us
<Sumica> 00,10this is why he was obsessed with steps in the castle http://tinyurl.com/cpavrr9
<RaveBrony> otakon: Hahaha, i saw that :D
<Wrek> 05Sumica: and slinkies
<Vivix> hehe
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Slinky slinky everybody loves a slinky
<naturesfury> well if they make a sea pony ep. s4 withh be nothing but background ponies talking
<Ryunosuke> Vivix: really? Pinkie breaks EVERY rule known to EVERYONE
<otakon> Sumica: oh God WHY WON'T IT DIE?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> GO SLINKY GO!
<Vivix> Yeah, but I don't think she can, since only the clones did it
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: My eyes!
<Vivix> but, you never know with Pinkie
<LadyCanary> Slinkies!
<RaveBrony> Everyone loves a slinky
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why does he have a Loki name tag?
<LadyCanary> It's fun for a girl and a boy!
<LadyCanary> (also Sombra)
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: Soon™ http://derpiboo.ru/157865 ...Maybe™
<Ryunosuke> summica
<Ryunosuke> why
<Ryunosuke> just.... why
<Deacon> you can have your slinkies, I'll cuddle with my log anyday
<Sumica> 00,10because
<Vivix> Who came up with Slinky? "We need a unisex toy.." "How about a...metal spring that you push down stairs?"
<Chrysalis> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmW6ErFS5xo&feature=related feels for lyra
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Log! Log!

<Deacon> Vivix ah, hate when that happens
<Vivix> so sad ;__;
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: gotta love how they keep saying "FUn to play with not to eat" but keep making molds that are FOOD SHAPED!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiE3Jhtd85A&feature=relmfu
<otakon> Seriously just give them ANIMAL MOLDS
<Sumica> 00,10ofcorse realy a slinkie would not work on those steps that Sombry had
<Vivix> true-
<otakon> stop making them out to be FOOD if you can't EAT THEM GODDAMMIT!
<Chrysalis> its pony land, everything works
<Vivix> I always loved how childrens animals toys here are anatomically correct
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sumica: Thats why he turned evil
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He lost his slinky
<Vivix> horse dicks everywhere
<Chrysalis> they could have, square slinkies,
<Deacon> otakon it's their way of saying you can't sue them if your child decides to eat the,
<naturesfury> any1 finished dl'in yet?
<RaveBrony> 90% here :(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still find it funyn Nightmare Moon was made because of a temper tantrum basically
<Chrysalis> that go around circular staircases
<naturesfury> 94
<Chrysalis> made by pinkie
<Ryunosuke> so we have Luna and her Abacus, Sombra and his Slinky
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Sumica> 00,10as a foal he loved his slinkie
<Vivix> SpadeMagnes[School], not a tantrum, something deeper
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School] didja know it's on steam now
<Deacon> ?

<otakon> Deacon: yeah well little kids are stupid like that AND they really need to stop making food molds

<naturesfury> well fuck my mb/s is goign slower and slower the closer i get to finishing
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Did Luna never think most ponies didnt enjoy the night because most were....I dont know..asleep?
<Ryunosuke> inb4 sombra x slinky shipfics :)

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "Trying something and deciding it’s not for you is one thing, but coming in with your friends solely for the purpose of grazing off samples and taking no less than 12 servings of meatballs over a five minute period (yes group of college students, I’m talking to you) is just plain wrong."

<HoodyNinja> thelonepony: Sucks, man. Hope you get better.
<Ecoyli> If your enemy is greater, elude him. If equal, prepare for him. Is weaker, CRUSH him. - Sun Tzu

<SpadeMagnes[School]> They never fucking find anything
<MLP_Brovakiin> thanks HoodyNinja :D

<Dark_Horst> Wrek: yeha, that'S an g3a3 with 2cm more butt B)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I really dont want to join the army
<Sumica> 00,10so I passed on it
<Venus> 08,01i'm thinking of joining the Navy
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School] is that a show on discovery?
<Lil_B> and always remember that when sieging a stronghold or a Town, your army should be 4times as large as the defenders (actualy army strategy book)
<LadyCanary> :O
<Venus> 08,01i don't think i'd last very long
<thelonepony> HoodyNinja: you lucky bastard :D
<Wrek> 05Venus: brign condoms you gusy go port to port >;3
<Dark_Horst> doesnt surprise me though
<HoodyNinja> Venus: But that would mean excersize
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would rather not die for a country that is full of idiots and money grubbers
<HoodyNinja> :'(
<Shizuka> 13are you sure saturn? i think you could fit in well IN THE NAAAVY
<Shizuka> 13something sail the seven seas IN THE NAVY
<DerpyMuffins> Good advice there Wrek
<Sumica> 00,10they would not tell me the job I would be doing cause it was clasafied

<Shizuka> 13and when saturn comes home from the navy we could stay at the YYYYYYYY M C A!
<Everlasting_Joy> And now I'm getting that Simpsons episode where Homer joins the Naval Reserves.
<RaveBrony> naturesfury: Does what empire you choose matter??
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would watch this artifact show on History channel/discovery channel, if they ever fucking found shit
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst and usually does something to it that the people who buy it get slightly lower quality than germany itself
<HoodyNinja> Formerly known as just the YMCA
<Sumica> 00,10and I see shizu did not get enough sleep cause she is silly
<Shizuka> 134-1
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is there a term for someone who lives in a country but sort of hates it?
<naturesfury> RaveBrony: havent gotten there yet
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: yeah. ak4 seems to have 2 cm more buttstock than the g3
<Dark_Horst> otherwis,e no idea

<Sumica> 00,10I was gonna say north korean
<Buytoast> REPUBLICAN?
<Shizuka> 13HoodyNinja: but if you think about it the independents are the most disillusioned these days
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Because I really hate my country, but I cant do anything about it
<RaveBrony> Noooo, im not good with decisions like this!!
<HoodyNinja> Eh
<naturesfury> so which empire are we all going?

<Vivix> naturesfury, I think that was the mayan's point
<Wrek> 05to the 2012 doomsday talk
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How stupid do you have to be to think the world ends just because one damn calendar stops?
<RaveBrony> Wrek: Hah!
*Stallion_of_War Sup guys; I think we've made enough calendar for now. We won't need to update it for another 2000 years so I'm going to go take a smoke break

<Bronysith> Wrek: what if all the power companies in the world decided on december 21st to just shut down power for like 1 hour? that will freak people out
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why are you stopping on 2012? Thats when the WiiU comes out
<Chrysalis> also, for the mayans it was 13
<Chrysalis> not 2012
<Deacon> I think alot of shit's going down on the 23rd of december regardless
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The Myans predicted the WiiU :P
<Buytoast> my mom already has these big ass zombie posters hanging around the house Sumica, we got preparedness covered
<Wrek> 05to be honest many thigns freak people out
<Chrysalis> SpadeMagnes[School] dont say that, there may be good consoles in this generation yet
<RaveBrony> Yep
<Vivix> I think most people will remember dec 23 a few weaks after
<LadyCanary> It's true.
<Vivix> just like last time the world ended
<Stallion_of_War> December 21st will be the day they run out of this year's "Tickle me Elmo"

<Chrysalis> other than MLP of course
<LadyCanary> And I feel fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Twinkies
<Vivix> Sumica good point
<Buytoast> Nothing will.
<Chrysalis> SpadeMagnes[School] not if they are the cause
<RaveBrony> Arent they going away soon too??
<Buytoast> In the end, all that will remain is dust.
<Stallion_of_War> The 21st is the date when the Auster-Hagen Key countdown runs out...
<Chrysalis> you seen all the panic buying?
<Buytoast> Dust and burning wind.
<naturesfury> twinkies were supposed to survive a nukular explosion just not the end of the world
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why are cockroaches thought to be able to survive the end?
<RaveBrony> Scoots said Hostess went bankrupt O.o
<RaveBrony> Arent they closing?
<thelonepony> RaveBrony: they did
<Vivix> Cockroaches are believed to outlive man, not end of the world
<Shizuka> 13hostess filed for liquidation
<HoodyNinja> On the day of the rapture, all relegious people will be whisked off to heaven. and finally. Finally, the world shall know peace

<Chrysalis> Shizuka as well as trippling of salaries for a load of management
<RaveBrony> I liked Ding Dongs...
<RaveBrony> Not twinkies
<LadyCanary> I personally prefered the Drakes products.
<Chrysalis> they have no intention of staying open

<Invi> Nyra, somewhere way up there in mah logs ^^
<[SWAG]Haku> The 2nd Mecha was just the Gojira's bones in robot suit

<Nyra> Godzilla Hater!
<[SWAG]Haku> Vordox true, but really, Monster X didnt look ANYTHING like Ghidorah. He just looked like a new monster.
<haseo348> can we talk about pokemanz?
<Vordox> [SWAG]Haku: You had NO connection to that Monster X was Ghid at all'*
<[SWAG]Haku> Not the first time I saw the film
<Nyra> Ghidorah, was badass. But Godzilla was badass-e-er.
<[SWAG]Haku> I wasnt thinking when I watched it
<[SWAG]Haku> Nyra this is fact

<Netis> Always good alex and you?
<FlutterMEDIC> how about one of the Assassin's Creed games? (excluding #3)
<Nyra> Tiring, Canada_Brony, very tiring. Hasbro is trying my patience.
<OmegaSlayan> So how is Planet Side 2 so far?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> *:)
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
<SlushTheWolf> HI!

<Netis> Oh god, using irc on a nokia is shit XD
*Canada_Brony is a sir.
<Nyra> No, waiting for the legal documents to be sent from Hasbro, so I can sign them.
<Vordox> [SWAG]Haku: O.o
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> im good alexxm just kinda bummed about how the mlp game gives you BARELY any gems and expect you to spend over 100 gems to get Rarity and Dash :S hope they make a Bit to Gem converter or some easy way to get gems...
<Vordox> [SWAG]Haku: WHAT?! Clover is Kaiju?
<FlutterMEDIC> seriously, who is streaming?
<alexxm> Vordox it's a giant monster so i guess so
<Canada_Brony> Which legal documents may I ask, Nyra?
<Vordox> alexxm: Coool...
<Nyra> The copyright allowance for the movie I'm making.
<thelonepony> ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<Canada_Brony> What is the movie about?
<Nyra> Its already been approved, just waiting for documents to ship.
<alexxm> Nyra whats your movie about
<Vordox> <--- oh look. graphics oooh aaaah
<Nyra> Generally, its going to be about the revenge/return of our favourite cheeselegs bug.
<FlutterMEDIC> Nyra: cool
<alexxm> Nyra chesselegs bug?
<Nyra> And, of course, every other villain in the series, including King Sombrero.
<Nyra> Chrysalis.
<alexxm> oh chrysalis
<FlutterMEDIC> alexxm: you know...because her legs look like cheese
<Canada_Brony> The ruler of the Tacocrystal empire.
<alexxm> FlutterMEDIC yeah i just realised that after i sent the message
<Nyra> Lol, yes even him.
<Nyra> Although Hasbro is giving me a headache in itself, finding a crew/team is even harder.
<Canada_Brony> Why, when will this movie be announced and where?
<Nyra> The movie will be announced, via 'recruiting video' on EQD and DHN.
<Nyra> Why? You ask Canada_Brony.
<SlushTheWolf> Whats DHN?
<Nyra> Because noone is willing to at least try their hand at such a momentous project.
<Canada_Brony> I would like to see it, of cource!
<Nyra> DHN = Derpy Hooves News
<SlushTheWolf> Ohh. Thanks!
<Nyra> I wish to have it released within a year - year and a half.
<Nyra> Hopefully, I will get some more application for crewmen/women.
<Nyra> applications*
<Canada_Brony> Can I help?
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh
<FlutterMEDIC> Nyra: what are the requirements?
<Nyra> Everyone is welcome to at least try.
<Nyra> Thats all I ask.
<Canada_Brony> What can I do?
<[SWAG]Haku> Wait what are we talking about now?

<Nyra> In terms of what is required, currently, anything.

<Wrek> 05Chrysalis: it means the login server isnt connection to you, so its not an error casued by a corrupt install etc
<Wrek> 05jsut keep trying
<Chrysalis> oh yeah i understand that, what i dont get is why the close the whole thing down for it
<Chrysalis> rather than reconnecting

<stallion1> how?
<DoctoDoctorWho> nnn: no, its just freaky.
<Pika-Picho> How do i get rid of this?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I hate my school, its built in a way that I cant work ahead for stuff
<Pika-Picho> Help?
<RoboGerbil> why does the stream keep cutting out?
<stallion1> thats stinks like crap!
<nnn> Pinkie pie is going to kill beber
<stallion1> wow
<Pika-Picho> Brb
<DoctoDoctorWho> nnn: Well why didnt you say so?! carry on

<stallion1> yes tell us more
<RoboGerbil> wow when you talked loud your sound crackled
<Vivix> everyone on youtube should buy a compressor, especially pewdiepie
<stallion1> bty I am streamless
<Pika-Picho> I cant watch the stream.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Anypony read the latest chapter of my fic? It just came out.
<stallion1> whats it called I need ont to read
<Pika-Picho> Hey,Mods.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ill link it if you want,
<stallion1> cool
<Wrek> 05hit play!
<Pika-Picho> Wrek,why cant we watch streams?
<Vivix> hit play
<stallion1> so you use chrome?
<Pika-Picho> Yes.
<stallion1> do?
<Vivix> open it in internet explorer
<Wrek> 05if you are usign chrome, the stream wont work, otehr browsers such as firefox have jailbreaked this error but cherome is a bit behind
<Pika-Picho> ...Fuuuuuu
<stallion1> lol
<Vivix> IE works fine
<Vivix> IE9

<otakon> yeah my stream keeps crapping out
<Deacon> I'm guessing everyone's glazing over PS2?
<otakon> eeyup
<DoctoDoctorWho> No sympathy for IE? http://th01.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/163/d/9/internet_explorer_pony_by_staticwave12-d539ccu.png
<Zacklego> http://inception.davepedu.com/
<Deacon> nope, none at all
*Vivix has no problems with IE
<Zacklego> Click da button
<Vivix> There's some deeper issues with it, but I don't understand them

<RoboGerbil> so are you chatting in game or skype or what?
<CupcakeWarrior> ive seriously never heard of this
<SafariMonkey> My day's been great, thanks, Canada_Brony
<CupcakeWarrior> how old is this game?
<Canada_Brony> Ok
<scout19_tf2> i fixed ma lag and i hear Wrek

<Canadian_Brony> DoctoDoctorWho built what?
<twilight_sprinkle> sombra sombra, is that like a dance? sombra sombraaaa~
<scout19_tf2> Canadian_Brony: srry im used to sayin dat
<DoctoDoctorWho> We should totally watch the iron giant for movie night sometime
<otakon> we have

<Hail`> oh, are we playing planetside 2?
<Hail`> because i have that game :D
<Zacklego> What do about justin.tv
<DoctoDoctorWho> Obstruction detected. Composition, Titanium alloy supplimented by photonic resonance barrier. Probability of mission hinderance, ZERO PERCENT!
<scout19_tf2> Zacklego: wut about it
<Wrek> 05if you are usign chrom the stream embedd will nto work, firefox and or IE will work.
<Wrek> 05otehrwise jsut press play
<DoctoDoctorWho> yeah, dean was cool
<Zacklego> it wont play
<Rose`> wrek, imma play ;d
<Canadian_Brony> so that's why it's not working for me..
<VenHur> Do what the Wrek says!
<Rose`> Wreck it Wrek
<DoctoDoctorWho> Thing is, I would know how a Photonic resonance barriar would work too...
<stallion1> YESH
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ermahgerd, Erm ah Nerd.
<Zacklego> GTFO JUSTIN.TV!
<Zacklego> Justin tv wont allow me to view the stream
<Rose`> the photons resonate in such a way as to create a solid barrier?
<sonicdude558> I will be back
<sonicdude558|Food>
<Wrek> 05as i said zack
<Wrek> 05are you using chrome?
<stallion1> food words
<Wrek> 05Zacklego
<Wrek> 05are
<Wrek> 05you
<Wrek> 05using
<Wrek> 05chrome
<Wrek> 05if yes
<Wrek> 05thats your problem
<Zacklego> :[
<stallion1> lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rose`: The most likely way you could make a forcefield like that is via a mass-energy conversion. You sake the light(Photons) in their energy state and beam it across into a solid state. Thus, making an instant wall.
<Wrek> 05switch brower
<Wrek> 05s
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek: I think you mean Browser.
<scout19_tf2> brb gonna fix lag again
<stallion1> maby we should put that info on the screen for now or something
<Rose`> DoctoDoctorWho, wouldnt you need projecting and recieving points?
<Rose`> or does it work in a spherical manner?
<scout19_tf2> YAY i fixed it
<Rose`> i'd assume the former, considering that there is a lack of knowledge of the properties of light in a hypothetical solid state?
<scout19_tf2> ;)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rose`: I imagine that would be what the pylons on the sides of the gate are for
<stallion1> bc this has happened like ten times since Ive been here
<DoctoDoctorWho> stallion1: what?
<stallion1> the chrome issue
<scout19_tf2> im starting to feel like some tf2 like always
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rose`: Wait, Im the doctor, and your rose, dammit.
<stallion1> rp?
<scout19_tf2> :P im confused
<DoctoDoctorWho> And we're talking theoretical physics, holy shit.
<stallion1> I will be villian #5 who jumps off of cliffs
<Rose`> if it happens that light when in a solid takes on a physical weight, or is affected by gravity in an exadgerated way (in consideration to its normal behavior) couldnt one hypoteticallys have a central pylon with a sphrical field generated? if such a thing were possible, one could theorize that adjusting the power or flow of protons thru the pylon would increase or decrease the area of the
<Rose`> field?
<Rose`> also :D, this is awesome, DoctoDoctorWho
<scout19_tf2> :D
<scout19_tf2> :P
<stallion1> ooooo
<stallion1> jumps off cliff
<Rose`> oh goodness, DoctoDoctorWho! look at us, gossiping about theoretical physics like a couple of old housewives~
<scout19_tf2> housewives:D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rose`: Well pleasure to make your internet aquaintence, I see this blossoming into a beutifull friendship
<DoctoDoctorWho> Blossom, rose, haha
<Rose`> ha!
<Rose`> i see what you did there :3
<Rose`> puns <3
<Rose`> and i assure you, the pleasure is mine
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/000/681/what-you-did-there-i-see-it.thumbnail.jpg
<DoctoDoctorWho> hehehe
<Rose`> its not everyday that one gets to have a conversation about the possible configurations of hypthetical technology based on theortical physics :D
<Pinkies4thWall> OHAI
<Rose`> but what is your take on the photon sphere possibility?
<scout19_tf2> o hey wuts uo Pinkies4thWall
<scout19_tf2> *up
<Pinkies4thWall> What's this? a new streaming stie
<Pinkies4thWall> ?
<Pinkies4thWall> *site
<DoctoDoctorWho> As for the central pylon, Im not sure that would work in a linear gateway manner. The majority of human construction is very uniform, assuming it even expands in a sphere anyway.
<Rose`> true, and that is the main premise of this theory
<RoboGerbil> Wrek: so how do i join you?
<DoctoDoctorWho> And oh how I love it when I get to dabble in the technology of the future.
<Rose`> IKR!
*LadyCanary gives Wrek a peck on the cheek >////<
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 you there?
<Chip_Chop_OC> Hey guys whats up?

<Rose`> im a medic in the unitedstates army
<Rose`> but im applying to a college for theoretical phsyics
<stallion1> needs to read more
<scout19_tf2> Rose': hoorah
<DoctoDoctorWho> Huh, oh. um, oh.
<Rose`> yourself, DoctoDoctorWho?
<Chip_Chop_OC> Hey guys whats up?
<scout19_tf2> hello Chip_Chop_OC

<LadyCanary> Sniff.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im currently married to my goal of global domination. As you see this kind of puts us at odds. This is very awkward, I should go.
<Rose`> what happens when you put light in a mirror made of one way glass?
<Rose`> not at all, im a merc by trade
<Rose`> the army just offered a good contract :3

<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnes[R]: It is a skill in the sneak skill tree
<thelonepony> Hi Pikachu :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh, no wonder I never knew about it
<pony_6020> watch starfox all of sudden appear
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I was not the sneaking type

<AlienWarhead> DoctoDoctorWho: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate
<CriticKitten> Take ALL the books
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I try to sneak but I tend to carry alot of shit with me
<pony_7973> ahhh this quest
<Pikachu> Scoot-Scootaloo: So im a unicorn? :P
<CriticKitten> Twilight Sparkle demands it
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: A state or territory partly controlled by (but not a possession of) a stronger state but autonomous in internal affairs; protectorates are established by treaty.
<pony_7973> is he doing dark brotherhood questline? i think thats what it is
<AJIsAwesome> SHe. :)

<pony_7973> second guess
<Pikachu> Ladders are always good :D
<AJIsAwesome> *She
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I slaughtered them all, thats the most interaction I ever got
<pony_7973> i remember doing the darkbrotherhood questline where there was one part you had to kill the bride at a wedding, and if you did it without anyone noticing you would get a bonus
<RDash5000> not anymore
<pony_7973> i killed her, used invisibility, and ran out without anyone noticing
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I love increasing your reputation with people allows you to pilfer more stuff from their houses
<weeping_pegasi82> kill em when your done
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnes[R]: Did you only do one playthough, I did two, one fighter, one sneaky
<shizumobile> Dude he's right there
<pony_7973> it wasnt until i looked it up that i learned you were suppose to push a statue above her to kill her
<PonyBean> ladders are only good if they dont give you splinters
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/220/1/8/Dalek___Exterminate___Campaign_by_DegaSpiv.png

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Was this the right choice morally?
<weeping_pegasi82> who cares it's SKYRIM
<CriticKitten> Morality is silly in a game like Skyrim LD
<CriticKitten> *:D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well I have this thing where I tend to always try to do the right thing ..dont know why
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnes[R]: probably not, but thieves don't care because you didn't kill him
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> shizu check under the bed of that guy :p
<weeping_pegasi82> Ah memories of KOTOR where I killed juhanni and A LOT of people
<PonyBean> so lost e.e

<Jmo> Where'd Adam go?
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm, I have no idea.
<AdamTheDuck> Yes Jmo? .-.
<Jmo> Why'd you get off Steam fewl
<AdamTheDuck> Studying for my last 3 exams. .-.
<Jmo> Pffft
<pony_7973> ptolmes
<Jmo> I had something important to tell you
<Jmo> But I see how it is
<Shizuka> 13and that's when we found the stargate addresses right? right?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Screw this alien consperacy shit
<Afflict> and I'm off to bed, night everyone
<Jmo> ISH SO SPESHUL ADAM
<Jmo> TEEHEE
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<AdamTheDuck> Wat.
<Jmo> <:
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Even if there are aliens out there somewhere, I still find all these theories of aliens communicating with us, such utter bullshit
<Sylandest> evening, everypony :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello there Sylandest
<Sylandest> howdy AdamTheDuck
<thelonepony> Hi Sylandest
<Sylandest> howdy thelonepony
<Panda> FIFFF TEEEN LIGHT YEARS AWAY
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Sylandest. :)
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: IN THE FUTUUUUURE~
<Sylandest> howdy AJIsAwesome :)
<NocturnalBlade|AFK> hi Sylandest
<SlushTheWolf> Did anyone else suddenly disconnected?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<AdamTheDuck> SlushTheWolf, nope.
<thelonepony> no
<SlushTheWolf> ok. weird.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The possiblity of a planet that is inhabitable is probably very low
<Shizuka> 13BILLIONS AND BILLIONS
<Sylandest> oh, sorry, late howdy NocturnalBlade|AFK
<SpadeMagnes[R]> None of this crap makes any sense
<Rosfox> 10 planets?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Pfff... jupiter? what the fuck could live there?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The fucking lace has massive storms dumbfuck
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *place
<Shizuka> 13you missed the earlier ep where we tripped out to floaters and sinkers and hunter
<Panda> xD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This guy is spouting such bullshit
<Panda> Shizuka, you guys were talkign about poop?
<wipergone2> panda
<SpadeMagnes[R]> That...makes no sense
<Panda> wipergone2 ^^ yes?
<Shizuka> 13SpadeMagnes[R]: just wait
<Shizuka> 13also recall that when this was made, the cold war was still a thing
<wipergone2> nuke
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Where the fuck is this twat getting these figures?
<Shizuka> 13literally out of his butt, but that's not the point
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Im no scientist but this sounds like he's pulling this shit out of nowhere
<SlushTheWolf> the same place we get statistics.
<SlushTheWolf> our imagination.
<Panda> imaginaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaation
<Shizuka> 13the point is you can start with the huge huge number of stars, the huge huge number of planets, and whittle it down by modest amounts to reach the number of alien civs
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Even those even exist
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The possibility of any other life out there is slim
<Shizuka> 13well, there's a huge amount of planets
<moobull69> to those who think mlp has plot holes: http://www.derpibooru.org/158669
<Panda> SpadeMagnes[R]... and why are we the only lifeforms?
<Shizuka> 13and it's entirely possible life likes to get started, organic molecules aren't hard to make
<moobull69> eww why are you using purple text?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also where the fuck was this guy getting ten planets in our system?
<Panda> moobull69: thats pink....
<J_E_Smith71> moobull69: Because she's the mod and purple's her color of choice
<GabeMoist> ten is a nice number
<SpadeMagnes[R]> We only have 8
<Jmo> kina puta la caleros say heet cinqo meat satay weh Adam
<Jmo> kekekeke
<SlushTheWolf> Purple is an awesome color.
<Shizuka> 13but the rest of those fractions demonstrate the problem of timing, that to actually contact an alien civ we'd have to find one that has a planet, evolved life, reached intelligence, reached high tech, and didn't blow itself up
<SpadeMagnes[R]> We have 8 planets in our system...what the shit are the additional two?
<Shizuka> 13pluto was still counted at the time
<Panda> In otherwords, its plausible that we arent the only lifeforms in this vast universe....
<Shizuka> 13ten is a round number
<JRP2234> ok battle kid is hard a shit can be
<Shizuka> 13not only plausible, almost certain
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, o.o
<Jmo> <:
<Shizuka> 13there's simply too many planets out there for us to be alone
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I still dont get why Pluto isnt a planet anymore
<GabeMoist> Shizuka, and then there are moons that are speculated to have/had life that you can include as well
<Shizuka> 13too small
<Shizuka> 13its moon is bigger
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Thats a shitty reason
<Panda> I say plausible because its only still theory, Shizuka. Until we prove it... we cant be certain... you know?
<Shizuka> 13there's also bigger asteroids in the asteroid belt
<SlushTheWolf> we've discovered only 10 so far that could 'support' life. thats the problem.
<Shizuka> 13if pluto was counted, we'd have to count i think two asteroids from the belt too
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Even if there is life out there, I dont buy the bullshit theories about aliens communicating to us
<Shizuka> 13no there's pretty much no chance of aliens contacting us
<GabeMoist> in that case, the number should be bigger than ten
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also, what if the aliens are violent?
<moobull69> no chance? enlighten us?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Then we're fucked!
<SlushTheWolf> aren't we violent enough?
<Shizuka> 13even if there's a pile of civs, space is still hugely huge
<Jmo> 'hugely huge'
<Jmo> lel
<moobull69> ignore how huge space is, so why?
<Shizuka> 13you can't ignore how huge space is
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So even if there is life the chance of us running into it is slim
<moobull69> I just did
<Shizuka> 13when light takes hundreds or thousands of years to get anywhere
<Shizuka> 13you can't communicate
<J_E_Smith71> SlushTheWolf: Not if the aliens have flesh melting ooze guns
<moobull69> you assume no one in the future made something to go faster than light
<moobull69> NO EINSTEIN
<moobull69> BAD NO TREAT FOR U
<GabeMoist> moobull69, can't ignore physics
<Shizuka> 13you can't break the light barrier
<DocSane> Ah, TV that Twilight Sparkle would like.
<SlushTheWolf> ah. "Invaders from Mars" type of aliens.
<moobull69> you can't say for sure
<Shizuka> 13it's plain impossible to break the light barrier, physics doesn't permit it
<moobull69> what did I just say?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Aliens could either be peaceful or be a conquesting nation
<moobull69> The physics in your theorys
<DocSane> Shizuka: No, but there are ways around it that are allowed.
<Fr0stC0lt> Were watching a dead guy?
<Shizuka> 13wormholes are pretty much the only open option
<moobull69> THAT WE KNOW OF
<DocSane> Shizuka: Warp drive is also allowable.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I say we dont try to break physics
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Physics are good
<GabeMoist> moobull69, when you discover something, then that can be considered
<Fr0stC0lt> oh goody, dead guy movie
<moobull69> GabeMouist you believe in religion?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yea... in alien standards, Earth wouldent be that special
<Boner> Hello Everypony
<Jmo> Dat name
<Boner> :3
<GabeMoist> moobull69, how is that even relevant?
<wipergone2> lol
<SlushTheWolf> Hi.
<wipergone2> dat boner
<Panda> Boner: leave
<Fr0stC0lt> As Dash said: Ok, bored now
<Shizuka> 13even by now our radio transmissions will only be a few dozen lightyears out
<Jmo> Oi Panda, you say to change your name please, not leave.
<moobull69> yes it is actually
<Rosfox> Oh how this reminds me of spore
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Starwars? Thats much more interesting than this
<Boner> ikr
<moobull69> all of you are talking about high school crap
<BlaxBlain> Jesus what are we watching?
<Shizuka> 13says the guy with 69 in his nick
<Panda> Jmo, and I say leave... why? because pandas dont like boners.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> and HAH I doubt aliens would nto cause wars regardless how advanced they are
<Shizuka> 13Boner: Change your nick please.
<Jmo> That's your own problem.
<Jmo> Not ours.
<Boner> Aight
<Meanwhile> Wow that was a fantastic time to look at chat.
<Panda> Jmo ;A; its the reason I cant repopulate!
<BlaxBlain> Why are we atching this?
<AJIsAwesome> Why aren't we? :3
<Paco> Back w/ new name
<BlaxBlain> Because this makes space boring.
<moobull69> guess what? over 100 years ago motorized carriages we're unheard of!
<thelonepony> A bit better
<SlushTheWolf> Hi again Paco!
<moobull69> But now? we can go well over 250
<buymyshirts> hey
<thelonepony> Paco?
<Shizuka> 13on specific tracks sure
<Paco> Yo
<thelonepony> Taco
<Shizuka> 13you don't do 250km/h on the standard highway
<moobull69> the point is, your thinking in restricted realms
<buymyshirts> yo pacoooo
<donutpop365> Ugh I'm so tired.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The possibility of finding a planet like earth is incredibly slim
<donutpop365> Ohhai AJIsAwesome.
<Paco> Hey buymyshirts
<AJIsAwesome> donutpop365: Go to bed? :)
<buymyshirts> yolo buy my shirts bro
<wipergone2> dat number
<moobull69> Our galaxy is huge you are 120% right
<thelonepony> no :3
<BlaxBlain> Oh boy filler!
<wipergone2> 806.4619
<moobull69> we may never be able to even get out of our own
<donutpop365> AJIsAwesome: I JUST finished reading for an assignment thing. Now I shall fall asleep to nice music :)
<donutpop365> I think.
<Panda> I'm just gonna put this out there: It's a little arrogant to believe that we are the only lifeforms in this entire universe, dont you think?
<moobull69> BUT, don't think it isn't possible because it could be
<buymyshirts> PACO :( [22:37:25] <Paco> BITCHBITCH

<donutpop365> Thanks thelonepony :D
<DocSane> Man, I remember when this show was first broadcast.
<BlaxBlain> Who is paco?
<moobull69> thing is, if it gets up to speed how does it slow down quick? We donoo lol
<AJIsAwesome> BlaxBlain: That one's safe.
<Meanwhile> This went south rather quickly.

<Shizuka> 13so we launched voyager
<Meanwhile> Janeway is best captain.
<Shizuka> 13they are stupidly tiny compared to everything else in space
<moobull69> Did you read it?
<moobull69> Nope
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/158033
<Shizuka> 13nothing in that link contradicts anything i've already pointed out
<moobull69> We can create the technology to get up to speed (not now later)
<Shizuka> 13duh
<Shizuka> 13that's still assuming humanity doesn't commit species suicide
<Shizuka> 13we're perfectly capable of it
<moobull69> wha
<Meanwhile> We can only hope.
<moobull69> you we're jsut alking about how
<spengbab> what's next?
<moobull69> nevermind

<weeping_pegasi82> agh my eyes, I really should have blinked more often
<SlushTheWolf> let America nuke Russia and see what happens, maybe Fallout?
<thelonepony> welp, gonna go, night everypony :)
<CrazyHippie> If extraterrestrial life ever goes in contact with us first. Then it will be like when Columbus first landed on the Americas. Which didn't end so well for the Native Americans. - Stephen Hawking
<weeping_pegasi82> night thelonepony
<CrazyHippie> ond hi
<CrazyHippie> and*
<wipergone2> this is boring
<wipergone2> space is boring

<weeping_pegasi82> don't complain
<SlushTheWolf> Night!

<spengbab> sorry i'm just gonna leave
<CrazyHippie> I might go soon. But I will stay for a bit, FOR SCIENCE
<Meanwhile> Well if we get dominated by aliens maybe it'll have the Watchmen affect and cause humanity to unite for better purpose.
<Meanwhile> And maybe scallops'll fly out of my pants.
<SnowlightDream> what the hell are you watching??
<DocSane> Cosmos
<Meanwhile> Well personally I'm watching german metal bands on youtube.
<SnowlightDream> haha sounds nice
<Meanwhile> I have no idea what they're saying, but it's still nice to listen to.
<SnowlightDream> ok now this is boring i think i might actualy DO my homework for once
<moobull69> shizuka, if you can understand this you may understand me: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory\
<moobull69> ugh kill that last \
<Meanwhile> Have fun with your homework SnowlightDream.
<Shizuka> 13right, you understand it
<SnowlightDream> thanks :)
<moobull69> You can go beyond light
<moobull69> Hardon colider?
<GabeMoist> dat hardon collider
<Meanwhile> Physics gives me a hadron.
<moobull69> We are trying to find out how our universe was made and it had to have gone faster than light
<Ralin> Wouldn't a hardon collider hurt?
<Meanwhile> Depends what you collide with I suppose.
<moobull69> ooh lol!@
<moobull69> I get it now XD
<Ralin> A hardon.
<moobull69> I have a sense of humor come on :P
<Ralin> Also, no it doesn't go faster than light.
<Meanwhile> If a hardon collided at faster than light it'd probably result in galactic pregnancy.
<GabeMoist> oh my
<Meanwhile> Wow, I think I just figured out stars are born.
<moobull69> it could! It could open a black hole
<moobull69> We only have theorys until someone gets sucked through a black hole and lives I guess
<Shizuka> 13no, the LHC and friends approach the speed of light, requiring monumental energies to do so
<Shizuka> 13but they do not break it
<DocSane> The king is making his speech.
<Meanwhile> The king of what?
<p4ngya> king of england
<DocSane> This bit of Beethoven was used in The King's Speech.
<Meanwhile> But we have a Queen.
<p4ngya> he must have fun in his imaginary spaceship :3
<Meanwhile> Admittedly, she doesn't really do anything but still.
<moobull69> where did u read that?
<moobull69> http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44629271/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/neutrinos-clocked-moving-faster-than-light-speed/#.UKx7q4bmqj0
<moobull69> YES it is trying to go faster than light
<moobull69> where did u read it wasn't?
<Shizuka> 13apparent FTL is legal within relativity because the spacetime distorts around the object
<Ralin> Nope, the neutrinos were an equipment failure
<Shizuka> 13the object itself is not breaking lightspeed
<Meanwhile> And then the neutrinos will mutate and then 2012.
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Ralin> And also not related to the LHC.
<DocSane> Shizuka: Like I said, warp drive is allowable.
<Meanwhile> But if you go warp 10 you'll hyper evolve into a giant catfish-newt
<moobull69> SO I can go faster than light as long as I go around it?
<DocSane> Shizuka: Now all we need to do is develop technology to shrink and expand local space-time and then carry it aboard a vessel.
<Shizuka> 13no, you can go faster than light by the accounting of an outside observer
<Shizuka> 13but you yourself cannot exceed lightspeed
<moobull69> ooh god, you beat me at my own game
<Shizuka> 13not really, you just have no idea what you're trying to argue
<moobull69> You assume anything going faster than light gets sucked into a black hole
<Shizuka> 13um.. no..
<moobull69> which yes your idea is right
<Shizuka> 13are you high?
<moobull69> atm no, wish I was :(
<pony_2979> weLL
<pony_2979> This is depressing
<Meanwhile> What is?
<pony_2979> I come on and the first thing I see is a big BOOM
<moobull69> It kinda is I guess sorry shizuka
<pony_2979> lol
<moobull69> I will be good now promise :P
<Meanwhile> Show of hands, who's still alive?
<moobull69> now, is it ok to talk about S3 EP3?
<Panda> Shizuka: 1. moobull69: 0
*Jmo flails around
*oni_link raises hand
<Meanwhile> Mayjoo you should have been in bed ages ago.
<Jmo> It's 1505
<Meanwhile> You're 1505. >:I
<Jmo> Lel
<moobull69> You know, shizuka could ban me if he or she wasn't such a nice person. So I am not going to push my luck
<Meanwhile> On the one hand, it's awfully quiet, but on the other the alternative is vast amounts of gibberish as is the usual for this chat.
<oni_link> this guy is deep yo
<BlaxBlain> Why are we watching this :'(
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: Why are we keeping score?
<AJIsAwesome> BlaxBlain: Why AREN'T we? :3
<Panda> AJIsAwesome, because I am bored.
<DocSane> This was one of the greatest TV series ever shown on American public TV.
<Meanwhile> S'hard not to be bored at 7AM tbh.
<Meanwhile> So great that everyone fell asleep.
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<GamerLuna> GANGNAM STYLE!
<AJIsAwesome> I'm asleep?
<oni_link> I'll just leave this here https://www.dropbox.com/s/n9v9cnvi5qa2mmf/pt3.jpg
<moobull69> ponystyle
<Meanwhile> Yes AJIsAwesome, this is all a dream. I am your conscience, stop drinking straight from the carton...
<GamerLuna> SOARIN STYLE!
<AJIsAwesome> But, I like drinking from the carton..... :<
<oni_link> ^
<Meanwhile> That's nasty.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm just joking. :D
<oni_link> Im not >:3
<Meanwhile> Think of the other people in the house who end up drinking your backwash.
<GamerLuna> EYYYYYYYY SEXY LADEHH!
<oni_link> Bah they're family
<AJIsAwesome> I use cups, I don't drink striaght from catons. :D
<oni_link> They do it too :I
<AJIsAwesome> *cartons
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<cougrgrl> ok, hi
<Meanwhile> Is your a key broken?
*oni_link spins in his computer chair
<Meanwhile> This must be what old folks homes feel like.

<GamerLuna> ..........
<GamerLuna> ......................
<GamerLuna> HI EVERYPONY!
<AJIsAwesome> Do not spam, GamerLuna. :)

<GamerLuna> OHHHHH....OK
<DeathStar> Meanwhile: nope ^_^
<oni_link> I want this man's voice
<Meanwhile> Wasn't talking to you DeathStar but ok.

<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Regardless, it's pretty good.
<oni_link> I played the Rayman Legends demo at gamestop, me and my friend had so much fun. He was dying of laughter because he didnt know what was going on but he liked it alot and so did I
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: O U
<DeathStar> SuperBrony64: that's fine ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<DeathStar> SuperBrony64: it's still really good ^_^ you should try drawing more
<AJIsAwesome> I still need to find the time to.
<moobull69> nice sb64 like the art :D

<oni_link> pronz everywhere in Vegas
<sub06905> :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: lol i guess if ya count Tosh.0 showing a thing of MLP and Tosh deciding "Hey! ill show Shy and Dash doin..that" then idk :D he's funny but MAN did that bit in the episode wierd me out 0_o
<sub06905> also a bunch of people dressed up as many characters
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Oh yeah.... I saw that. Even though Tosh is known for this kind of stuff, he went too far with that.
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I saw that on YouTube today. :I its only gonna spread the mentality that all pony aficionados are cloppers
<oni_link> even more
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: yeah agreed
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: yeah :S
<sub06905> i seen a guy dressed as Sylvester with two beers in his hand, he looked drunk
<killerpony7733> Then you know how the furry fandom feels
<oni_link> I still laughed but at the same time it kinda sucks
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: Sylvester the cat or Sylvester Stallon?
<oni_link> killerpony7733: I do and I sympathize
<sub06905> the cat
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> same here oni_link
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: OKay, that's weird. :D
<oni_link> Or anime fans if you think about it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so i just played the new DmC demo
<oni_link> what did you think about it Sketch_Toku_Brony ?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> it was AWESOME /)^3^(\ felt like a dmc game dont see why so many "Die Hard" fans are bitching about it just its an AU story,totally gonna preorder it :)
<oni_link> that game is going the route of Sonic 06 in terms of it cannon but if its fun, Ill still play it
<aniderp> morning
<FlutterMint> off to bed, hope to see you all tomorrow night
<oni_link> *it not being cannon
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, aniderp. Bye, FlutterMint. :)
<oni_link> goodnight FlutterMint
<oni_link> hey aniderp
<sub06905> night FlutterMint
<sub06905> elo aniderp
<Shizuka> 13oh carl, if only you knew how the oslo accords really ended
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: AU story?
<DocSane> Sadly, Dr. Sagan, there's more profit in death than in life.
<Java> NASA is preparing to announce a "History book level of finding" finding from their Lunar drone.
<Shizuka> 13>hopeful
<Shizuka> 13carl, you never saw honey boo boo
<Java> Mars drone
<Java> Soryy
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: Alternate Universe,like instead of Dante and Vergil's parents being Sparda (Demon) and Eva (Human) like 1-4 told it,its Sparda and Eva (Demon and Angel respectively) and other slight changes kinda those What If? issues of SpiderMan (like IF he embraced the symbiote rather than get rid of it)while still keeping the original story intact
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: ah. but if it still feels like DMC at heart then I think I can overlook that
<DocSane> And with that, I think I'll go to bed. Night, all.
<DocSane> Thanks for the stream.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: yeah it plays like it,even better imo lol if ya pratice enough you can pretty much beat most enemies and not touch the ground AT ALL :D so cool!
<Vash> Java they recently said humans could settle for lng periods of time, also more evidence of water, lower radiation levels than expected, and we know the descovery has something to do with the prove useds to study compounds in soil and air thats intended to look for organics
<oni_link> DocSane: good night
<Vash> I bet its amino acids or something like that Java
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I want it in that case :3
<Vash> probe, i meant probe
<Java> Well, they already announce that there's no Methane there.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: eeyup totally gonna preorder it when i can :)
<Java> But we can always introduce methane if we want to
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: NICE :)
<Vash> Java they redacted that claim?
<Java> yep
<Java> No Methane
<Vash> Arsenic life all over again huh Java?
<Java> I hope so.
<Vash> I meant that they retracted that claim as well
<J_E_Smith71> Thanks Shizuka
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> well thankfully most of the Tosh mlps vids are blocked :S thats a relief
<aniderp> hm
<Kandarihu> Thnks for streaming, Shizuka
<Java> NASA is like "Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to announce stuff prematurely now"
<Vash> Java lets hope for some interesting organics
<Java> I hope so.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Java lol inb4 That what SHE said :D
<Java> XD
<Vash> oh y'all
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so did anyone hear about a REAL Slender game being devoloped?
<Java> I don't think so.
<Java> The publisher is too afraid of lawsuit
<Java> The creator of Slenderman said "go ahead" but the publisher is like "What if they sue when this game become successful?"
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yeah it is being developed by ParsecProductions and Blue Isle Studios. a sequel supposedly
<Java> Too much copyright troll in the US
<valoreins|AFK> bad news, why it has to be the theatre in my town... http://www.21cineplex.com/theater/bioskop-empire-xxi,23,BDGEMPI.htm

<weeping_pegasi82> I would say something else but I can't think of anything else
<PrincessLuna> Java so you have a seapony then?
<aniderp> im pinkie and i know it
<oni_link> nein!
<Java> No seaponies in my kingdom!
<aniderp> not so tigggght
<Java> I can't stand their shoo be doo!
<aniderp> but its catchy
<killerpony7733> Sumica I still freaking love my MAX units armor and helmet and what else i put on it. It makes it terrifying to the enemy i even boosted morale on some players to charge up from behind me following me up to the enemy XD
<Java> I know T_T
<oni_link> I lol'd at Rarity's whining and I thought it was cute too :I
<weeping_pegasi82> but it's sort of giving me a headache
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> PrincessLuna is here to Take back Equestria :D http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/066/f/d/luna_effect_3_by_johnjoseco-d4s024g.jpg
<aniderp> shoo be doo shoo be doo
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> dat MM2 :)
<Java> Luna Shepard?
<PrincessLuna> theres only a dark ending though
<Sumica> 00,10I am glad they removed same side clipping on troopers
<weeping_pegasi82> ah mega man, never played it
<dalekkahn> What game are you all talking about?
<Socks> Looks at stream without sound O.0 dafaq
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol now i wanna hear MM2 with lyrics :D

<weeping_pegasi82> PrincessLuna: I'll try and bye! :)
<dalekkahn> Bye PrincessLuna
<Sumica> 00,10think my firefox died
<PrincessLuna> no no, lyrics to megaman 2 with lyricssss
<SnowlightDream> bye bye princeluna
<oni_link> we should look at some more moonbase alpha trolling stuff :3
<PrincessLuna> im staying :D
<AJIsAwesome> Actually, I think Megaman 2 is an overrated game.
<oni_link> ^
<PrincessLuna> much like FF7 xD
*Socks stabs Sumica's firefox to make sure dead
<oni_link> Its also the only one ive beaten XD
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah the sequels had improvements
<weeping_pegasi82> 3 doors down?
<weeping_pegasi82> nope nevermind
<J_E_Smith71> GameBoy Mega Man 4 is my favorite
<AJIsAwesome> Don't get me wrong. I think it's a good game, but it has way too much hype.
<oni_link> 3rd was my favorite for the slide
<killerpony7733> Sumica seriously i think if i put a foregrip on this gun i could essentially make it a sniper weapon
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: just like SMB3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> PrincessLuna: i wish the rights to MM were in Inafune's hands :( not sure what capcom will do
<weeping_pegasi82> oi!
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: Precisely. I find Super Mario World much more enjoyable than SMB3.
<PrincessLuna> Sketch_Toku_Brony: aslong as its something decent it isnt too bad
<Java> So.... what you guys impression on Wii U?
<J_E_Smith71> The stream just rippled away
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: I like em both but I cant take one over the other
<PrincessLuna> Nintendo dying Java
<Java> :(
<oni_link> Java: I want it
<Java> Don't say that
<Sumica> 00,10settings, I be playing with them
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> PrincessLuna: yeah i guess your right,if they dont cancel it anyway :D sigh hope MM makes a great comeback :)
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm not really following nintendo anymore
<Java> Nintendo is the only pure video gaming company now
<AJIsAwesome> I still need to get it.
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: MM is dead though :I
<Java> I want Sega to come back
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Java make a new Dreamcast?
<dalekkahn> Once again, Nintendo has some neat capabilities with the hardware, but not enough good titles for it to really be good
<weeping_pegasi82> Sonic has died over the years I think
<PrincessLuna> Sketch_Toku_Brony: well battle network was an interest MM
<Java> OF COURSE!
<AJIsAwesome> I want Sega to focus more on their other franchises rather than just Sonic, IMO.
<oni_link> Java: they have potential, colors and generations were good.
<JRP2234> mica i love you
<J_E_Smith71> oni_link: Yeah only thing big coming is the Sonic/MegaMan crossover comic
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Java> Sonic is still alive and breathing
<AJIsAwesome> *^^
<weeping_pegasi82> umm... please no
<Java> Sonic Colours are awesome
<oni_link> J_E_Smith71: Oh yeah the Archie comic crossover :O
<JRP2234> aww mica why dident you play it?
<PrincessLuna> Java: sonic is on steam now..
<AJIsAwesome> I enjoyed Sonic Colors/Coulors a lot.
<JRP2234> OMG ITS SUPERMAN
<Java> Yes,
<Sumica> 00,10cause this is not over yet, duh
<AJIsAwesome> PrincessLuna: THere's nothing wrong with that.
<Java> Also a lot of discounts this week
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> PrincessLuna: yeah i liked those as well though i kinda grew out of them cause they were a little repetitive
<PrincessLuna> nothing wrongggg just seemed kinda random to see sonic on steam one day
<PrincessLuna> Sketch_Toku_Brony: yeahhh i stopped at 2 xD
<Sumica> 00,10so other then my playing around hows it looking?
<Java> Why not? I thought PC gamers keep asking for more games?
<AJIsAwesome> PrincessLuna: It allowed PC gamers to play Sonic games.
<Sumica> 00,10better worse dont know?
<weeping_pegasi82> Sumica: good so far
<JRP2234> mica you seem to always stop the ponys half way
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Love these new toys you have
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> PrincessLuna: its 5-6 for me :D Star Force was neat
<sub06905> um
<sub06905> ...
<AJIsAwesome> Plus, have you seen what people do with Sonic Generations nowadays? It's pretty interesting.
<weeping_pegasi82> oh god
<sub06905> all my yes!
<JRP2234> YES
<aniderp> fluttershy likes it..
<Java> What is this?
<aniderp> she said yay
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: Yeah and theres a community that is dedicated on hacking those games and making em better and making new levels
<PrincessLuna> (i own sonic generations on steam) :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: ah man i need to get that :D its pretty cheap now huh?
*AdamTheDuck comes back and sees old gen ponies
<AdamTheDuck> So much yes! \:3/
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Think it is now.

<sub06905> rainbow dash always dresses in style~
<weeping_pegasi82> would it kill some people to actually work hard on a television show?
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: New material for people who want "ponies"?
<J_E_Smith71> weeping_pegasi82: Yeah, her name was Laren Faust
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol there needs to be mod for Fallout where the mutants are G3 ponies :D
<PrincessLuna> Well im sure some people would die of natural causes while working on a tv show..

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SuperBrony64: sorry :$ im hungry
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm, need an image of trollface for not real reason at all
<J_E_Smith71> And for one second we have the weird Twilight face back there
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol how did you NOT notice till now? :D
<NocturnalBlade> incoming house destruction :D
<PrincessLuna> needs moar card
<AJIsAwesome> I was actually pretty shocked that AJ and Rarity got alot of speaking lines in this compared to the others.
<JRP2234> mica it would be a sham if there where TXT in the way
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> WTF- BOOM :D
<JRP2234> text*
<SnowlightDream> just a test
<Java> poor tree.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<PrincessLuna> Luna :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hope Luna gets more screentime in S3 :$
<sub06905> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) my body is﻿ ready
<PrincessLuna> was so happy she got screentime in the first episodeee
<Sumica> 00,10more test.
<killerpony7733> Sketch_Toku_Brony Somehow i feel like she will
<Java> We notice there's no pegasi and unicorn on Crystal empire
<AJIsAwesome> I hope Celestia gets more character as well.
<weeping_pegasi82> Java: EVERYONE know that silly :$
<AJIsAwesome> *is given
*Sumica grumbles
<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate! :$
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> inb4 Celestia orders Twilight to cut down a tree w/...A HERRING :D
<pony_7973> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) sha of casuals?
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' MadSurge
<Java> It means Crystal pony is strong enough with magic without horn
<Sumica> 00,10seems my controlls are being silly now
<oni_link> oh great, that face :I
<PrincessLuna> the test is to bring Celestia... a shrubbery!
<weeping_pegasi82> uh oh
<Java> Sauron
<MadSurge> ^
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> PrincessLuna: YES :D
<AJIsAwesome> I also want a reason why Celestia puts Twilight through these "tests" instead of doing these things herself. Maybe her powes is fading? I wust wish they'd give us an explanation.
<weeping_pegasi82> who here likes King Sombra?
<PrincessLuna> so basically they banished him to Canada?...
<MadSurge> weeping_pegasi82: I do!
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: I do, just not his representation in the premiere of S3.
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome Well hopefully they'll explain
<SnowlightDream> crepy eyes :|
<Java> Not vanish, I think that curse is to teleport them to the future
<weeping_pegasi82> oh snap
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: maybe shes a candidate for something in the future
<AJIsAwesome> killerpony7733: Me too.
<Sumica> 00,10guess i just have to lear hot keys
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome! :$
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge! :$
<Sumica> 00,10pausing stream
<PrincessLuna> Sketch_Toku_Brony: a nice one, not too expensive
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol this reminding me of Oolacile from Dark Souls :D kingdom/city vanishes for thousands of years :D
<Java> YOU SHALL PASS!
<weeping_pegasi82> DERPY! :$
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> PrincessLuna: oh yeah :D
<PrincessLuna> hahaha :D
<oni_link> and then Sumica comes back with that trollface pic
*weeping_pegasi82 is hypnotized by buffer
<PrincessLuna> weeping_pegasi82: round and around and around
<AJIsAwesome> I like Celestia (I prefer her over Luna, but I like both equally), and I wish they'd give her some more character development so we don't see her as just a ruler.
<Java> A lover perhaps?
<weeping_pegasi82> uh... I'm back
<Sumica> 00,10nah just bumping the quality up a couple knotches
<PrincessLuna> the next level of studies = sith lord twilight?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Java whooooo~!
<oni_link> ah
<weeping_pegasi82> ha I don't think so PrincessLuna
<AJIsAwesome> She has potential to be one of the best characters in the show, IMO.
<PrincessLuna> Luna just looks all boss while celestia shuts the door
<Java> I still wonder why Luna look at Twilight like that.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> PrincessLuna: maybe that dark power made NMM one way or another?
<GamerLuna> AJIsAwesome, WHAT!?!?! I HAVE A BIGGER PERSONALLITY THAN MY SISTER! HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE ME?!?! :'(
<sub06905> song~
<PrincessLuna> Sketch_Toke_Brony: it could be a thinggg

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :O two Lunas?!
<MadSurge> Boooo song
<Java> :/
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind this song, I just don't think it really fits with the situation.
<oni_link> I felt like the first two episodes' songs were rushed and just throw in
<Sumica> 00,10I like the poses when she ports
<Sumica> 00,10some realy good animations in it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man how i WISH that teacher pony was voiced by Bill Nye :D
<oni_link> indeed those poses
<Sumica> 00,10such as the wind blowen mane
<MadSurge> TEL'POR'

<AdamTheDuck> Bye oni_link
<PrincessLuna> all the scarves!
<weeping_pegasi82> or alaska
<{TY_RANCHULA}> so
<{TY_RANCHULA}> ?
<weeping_pegasi82> why did shining armors magic have to be pink?
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: Why not?
<Java> pink is manly
<Java> Before the 1930s
<MadSurge> weeping_pegasi82: because pink is MANLY
<PrincessLuna> thats one of the things!
<weeping_pegasi82> AJIsAwesome: just doesn't seem to fit him
<{TY_RANCHULA}> yes^
<Java> Then those moron said that pink i girly
<PrincessLuna> sacrifice scarves to appease the dark king!
<Java> In magazines, then people act like sheeple
*MadSurge digs Sombra's roars and wails
<Meanwhile> Pink is a colour, it means nothing.
<Java> True
<Sumica> 00,10yep I defenatly like this new toy
<{TY_RANCHULA}> my god
<Java> hornblocked
<MadSurge> MAGICBLOCK'D
<AJIsAwesome> What did Shining actually do in that scene when Sombra was attempting to engulf Shining?
<weeping_pegasi82> pink can be good in SMALL quantities unlike other shows that is just an avalanche of blinding pink
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, Rarity. :D
<Java> I thought Sombra will possess Shining
<{TY_RANCHULA}> *faild
<MadSurge> Rarity is about to faint
<AJIsAwesome> Java: As did I at first.
<Sumica> 00,10censored because it was too intense for children AJIsAwesome
<killerpony7733> ^Lolol
<Sumica> 00,10wait till the unraited DVD comes out
<PrincessLuna> instead of that dance, she could have used that energy to keep her spell going a bit more..
<weeping_pegasi82> somehow I doubt that :D
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: It would be interesting if there was a deleted scene that was removed from the actual episode.
<Sumica> 00,10unrated DVD also has spikes batchlor party
<MadSurge> ^
<{TY_RANCHULA}> has anyone seen spike

<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: mind block?
<AJIsAwesome> She doesn't WANT to remember the memories of Sombra.

<aniderp> yea
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: I love Desktop Ponies. :>
<aniderp> she flies upside down
<aniderp> i havent played with it in months
<d3rb> blasphamy, use it daily
<Gold_Demona> I made a little sprite of my OC, and she makes cloud art sometimes. :>
<aniderp> its distracting me
<Jmo> That sprite ish so damn cute.
<kimplix> hi
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo kimplix
<aniderp> it distracts me..
<kimplix> how's everyone today?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Oddly enough, it helps me stay focused on one activity.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: My eyes like to wander, and without DP on, it usually wanders to the other computer, where I get distracted by the internet.
<aniderp> well they move and then i watch them
<aniderp> distracts me when im on the net..
<Gold_Demona> I have two versions of my sprite. One that moves around the screen, and one that just stays in one place and hangs out.
*Jmo rolls around
<Gold_Demona> I usually have the sitting still one turned on when I'm doing stuff
<aniderp> like now im following dash
<Mutterguy> Jmo would would the Steam christmas present of a sweater?
<Gold_Demona> I like having my pony in the corner when I'm making art or playing games. :>
<aniderp> i dont know how to make gifs..
<Jmo> lolsweater
<Mutterguy> *version
<Jmo> I have enough jumpers
<Jmo> You should re-type that sentence.
<Rocket> Gold_Demona i want one too :<
<Jmo> Scribblenauts Unlimited Delayed Till 2013 in EU/UK Territories, Not in Australia/New Zealand
<Jmo> Fml.
<Mutterguy> yes it is broken
<Gold_Demona> It's a pain in the ass, but it was worth it to have my own sprite. :>
<d3rb> stralya, best place for games
<Jmo> Oh.
<Jmo> So, if you're in Australia or New Zealand, relax, the game will be out on the 28th of November
<Jmo> Huzzah!
<aniderp> i want my one alicorn to be on desktop pony
<Gold_Demona> I can't make sprites from scratch though. I used bases for almost all of the gifs involved.
<Rocket> Gold_Demona how you did him ?
<Wrek> 05driver udpated
<Wrek> 05starting up
<Mutterguy> Jmo would would be the Steam equivlent of a sweater as a Christmas present?
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: Downloaded a ton of bases and edited them in Photoshop
<Mutterguy> *what
<Rocket> Oh god that should take years to do that xD
<aniderp> i know how to fuse pokemon..
<aniderp> last friday i started and quite good at it..
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: Anything animated takes a long time to make.
<Jmo> Lawl
<Jmo> I'll pass.
<Gold_Demona> Took me several months to make my pony with as many behaviors as she has.
<Gold_Demona> And that's with a lot of copy pasta
<Gold_Demona> Like I said, I can't make animations from scratch
<aniderp> my short attention span...
<aniderp> makes me oh dash boom again
<Gold_Demona> heh
<aniderp> derpy eat muffin
<Wrek> 05sorry for that inconvenience ^_^
<aniderp> like i said it distracts me
<Gold_Demona> For those interested, here are most of the sprite animations for my pony. http://golddemona.deviantart.com/gallery/40724588
<Gold_Demona> For those not interested, ignore me. :P

<Sumica> 00,10well I feel dumb. that feel when you dont realise 32bit system caps at 4gigs ram
<Jmo> Lel
<Gold_Demona> Ermagerd Jermer
<Jmo> Ermagerd Derma
<Gold_Demona> :D
<Sumica> 00,10so hears hopeing I get my system upgraded by friday ^_^
<aniderp> im gettign paid today!
<aniderp> since friday im not..
<[]DeadpoolDash|ME3> lolz at 32bit 4gb ram cap
<XAX> http://i.imgur.com/sImlC.jpg picture looks rather good against the black background on my lockscreen.
<Gold_Demona> I like the Pinkie in the corner thar XAX :>
<XAX> Gold_Demona: I slide the pinkie to unlock the thing :D
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: How much ram do you have in that rig, Sumica?
<Gold_Demona> That's what I figured. That's cute. :D
<Sumica> 00,10more then a 32bit system can use
<Mutterguy> I got pinkie pyro as my background
<SafariMonkey> :P
<aniderp> how did you gtet that pony?
<Sumica> 00,1020gigs with Vram
<Gold_Demona> Makes me wish I had a device of that sort
<aniderp> on your ipod
<d3rb> lol
<aniderp> i want derpy on my ipod touch
<Jmo> How much without vram
<aniderp> to unlock it
<Gold_Demona> You durn whippersnappers and yer newfangled iPatch critters.
<aniderp> xax how did you get that pony slider?
<XAX> aniderp: Cydia.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek, did you asplode again?
<aniderp> what?
<Jmo> You have to jailbreak your phone
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: Wow. I couldn't imagine using even my tiny 6GB (my lowest spec) without x86_64
<XAX> ^
<aniderp> i have an ipod touch..
<Jmo> Same thing
<Jmo> iTouch, iPhone
<aniderp> how to jailbreak it?
<XAX> Sumica: ...20... whaaaaaaa
<Jmo> Egh I'm not going into that, you could potential screw it up if you don't know how to do it properly.
<XAX> Overkill.
<Jmo> It isn't worth it just for a damn pony slider .-.
<aniderp> not for me then..
<Jmo> pontentially*
<SafariMonkey> XAX: Depends what you use it for.
<Jmo> Not that I'm calling you stupid or anything, it's just a complicated procedure.
<Sumica> 00,10gonna take ages to back up my pony PMVs
<XAX> SafariMonkey: Completely true.
<XAX> Sumica: Remind me of your PMV directory size?
<SafariMonkey> XAX: I'm considering making an upgrade straight to 24GB
<Sumica> 00,10over 100gigs
<Jmo> You would only need 20GB RAM if you were a major video editor while multi-tasking with other things.
<XAX> ._.
<Jmo> There is no significant value in that much for a game.
<Mutterguy> Sumica dats a lot of poneh
<Jmo> gamer*
<Sumica> 00,10keep in mind the ram is shared with video ram
<Mutterguy> It's about 3 World of Warcraft files
<Sumica> 00,10video card has 2gigs
<Mutterguy> *file folders
<SafariMonkey> Jmo: I'm not a gamer, really, I just enjoy the occasional game. I'm a 3D modeller, animator and programmer front and foremost
<XAX> That's still 18 gigs.
<Sumica> 00,10and I do alot of multy tasking to stream
<XAX> ...true. Streaming takes the hardware.
<Jmo> rofl
<Jmo> Not much hardware.
<Lil_B> so, there is a possibility of Sea-Ponies https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/19/3FIzkz1xcEa3OEHrBM_sCQ2.png
<XAX> SafariMonkey: Have you animated anything pone?
<Jmo> In order to use up 18GB, you would have to really push your system to the limit by running so many applications,t hat would include 1080P Media encoding, HD Converting, playing several games at max, running a browser with TONS of pages open, even still that might only hit the 12GB mark
<Jmo> that*
<Jmo> Then again, there will be the restriction of your GPU
<Jmo> And the load it will put on the CPU if it isn't that decent.
<SafariMonkey> Jmo: Or do some hardcore simulation, like me
<Lil_B> why does everyone here work as eather an artist, an animator or a Programmer here?!
<Gold_Demona> My PC is old enough I'd have to build a new one to update the hardware. =/
<Jmo> Haven't seen how much simulation grinds up hardware.
<XAX> I opened 400 calculators on a school computer and it used 4 gigs of ram ^__^
*aniderp sits upside down
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: Or all three, like me? :P
<Jmo> School computers are pathetic
<Sumica> 00,10would explain my strugeling with KPS too
<SafariMonkey> Jmo: Simulation is primarily limited by ram. The more ram, the higher resolution you can simulate
<Lil_B> SafariMonkey I haven't seen your work, but the fact that you work in these fields is enough :P
<Jmo> Wouldn't it also be limited by GPU
<XAX> Jmo: I5's with 4gig of ram and a gig of VRAM
<Jmo> Due to the massive amount of pixel generation
<XAX> Not exactly horrible
<Jmo> i5, horrible. lel
<Lil_B> SafariMonkey it just bugs me because that's the Stuff I wanted to learn at first, but there was nothing available here, so I'm doin chemistry now :/
<Gold_Demona> I don't WORK as an artist, but I do make art. :P
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: I'm going to do Maths at Uni, because that's my real passion
<[]DeadpoolDash|ME3> http://derpy.me/tOeDP
<Wrek> 05FUCKING NGHUEGHNWEU
<vidmaster4694> Hiiiiii
<Jmo> o.o
<Lil_B> SafariMonkey sounds good, I like math... sometimes...
<Mutterguy> I liek Chocolate milk
<SafariMonkey> Jmo: Simulation isn't limited by the GPU as the GPU doesn't need to be doing anything while it simulates...
<vidmaster4694> i liek coffee
<vidmaster4694> So............ i heard you lieks mudkip
<Jmo> Give me an example of a simulation program
<Gold_Demona> vidmaster4694: mudkips is best pony

<SafariMonkey> Hey dishwasher_EXTREME
<Scoot-Scootaloo> SONN you best be trolling
<OmegaSlayan> howdy dishwasher
<XAX> Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh, I make the best alicorn OCs with that app.
<Kandarihu> [Turtlism_Girl], it's kind of become the bane of the OC community, this generator that you linked to.
<sammyruntz> What is happening with the ste=ream?
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu: Why?
<sammyruntz> *Stream
<XAX> >OC community
<XAX> lel
<TheRandomkid321> There is no other way of easily creating OCs is there?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Drawing....
<Kandarihu> SafariMonkey, people use it to create their OCs based on it's limited options for body parts, and it's all resulted in a wave of overly generic OCs.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> drawing is fun
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu: Oh, I see. I can't access it ATM, so I didn't know what it was like
<TheRandomkid321> What about us people who have no artistic talent?
<XAX> I wish I could into drawing.
<TheRandomkid321> If I had artistic taent I would draw one but I simply cannot
<XAX> I'll try to actually practice one day.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> then practice
<TheRandomkid321> I've been practicing for 13 years I'm never gonna get better. Hell in kindergarten when everyone was drawing stick fihures I just mixed colours into a disgusting blend of brown grey and green.
<jezebel> boop
<dishwasher_EXTREME> stick figures are awesome :D
<XAX> Night guys.
<vidmaster4694> i know an epic stick fight vid
<dishwasher_EXTREME> way back then and still in good use now
<TheRandomkid321> Ah kindergarten. The first time I had the urge to kill someone... and myself but mainly someone... Such a bitch...
<TheRandomkid321> I want to go to sleep but my dads in my bed because of the AC so I'm on the couch and I can hear my sisters HORRIBLE taste in music with fangirls SCREECHING!
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> beiber?
<TheRandomkid321> No. Call the shots. Do you think that if a band edited a pikachu slightly and basically parodies pokemon and put it on a shirt to sell they would get sued?
<Wrek> 05back

<Wrek> 05hope scoot took over yet?

<TheRandomkid321> Kandarihu WHy would that be?
<Wrek> 05you startin' up now Scoot-Scootaloo?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Setting up
<Kandarihu> TheRandomkid321, just trying to figure out why 13 years of practice hasn't done you much good. It doesn't make sense
<Wrek> 05good

<SploogeTheFish> and even the frosting inside
<Deacon> what is there to talk about cupcakes? there's nothing left to add to the discussion
<JamesClydesdale> I HAD A CUPCAKE MADE OF FROSTING! :3
<DinkyDoo> I just eat all the frosting before I eat the actual cupcakes.

<Kammerjunk> Gold_Demona: And that's why cupcakes are better! Frosting!
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Kammerjunk> DinkyDoo: I am jelly.
<SafariMonkey> Muffins are quite different....
<Gold_Demona> But muffins are fine just the way they are. :>
<SploogeTheFish> people only like muffins for derpy
