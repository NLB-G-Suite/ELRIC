*Wubstep Loves The Credits Song Thats Playing Nao
<Everlasting_Joy> fluttercry: Yeah, like all of them...
<FlaschenJoe11> Meanwhile: I thought they were nothing but a cheap knockoff of the Flintstones. Especially in the Crossover. It wasn't made well for me.
<Meanwhile> Given that they were the same company I wouldn't really call them a knock off...
<Ghosties> 04Guys, please stick around if you can. We've got The Jetsons movie later, Suited for Success next, and the Ticket Master afterwards. Plus, we're doing a top 10 FiM mareathon later!!
<Gumri> jetsons movie is 5.2 on IMDB... not sure if
<Tovler|Drunk> Also this movie could have bore 10-20 minutes without being indulgent. Its good, but I could name like 3 instances that could have used some expanded quiet emotion.
<Everlasting_Joy> Rarely do cross-overs work. As a matter of fact, I don't thing they have ever worked on TV.
<Sneaks> I am not leaving.
<Conyst> Remember they have blueberries so if your allergic or don't like wait until the banana ones are done
<Cherry> :)
<Meanwhile> More like, Flintstones...IN SPAAAAAAAAACE.
<HODOR1> no episode now/
<VenHur> ...Not...like Shrek the Third or Forever After...

<Thunder_Crescent> SCREW SLEEP WE ARE BONIES IM STAYING FOR PONIES!!!
<shaboostein> This will be a night to remember
<naturesfury> ObLiCody: untile 11 tomarrow

<AlchemyGold> I've only seen the first two Shrek movies. They were good, but I do hear Shrek 3 is real real bad.
<VenHur> Tovler|Drunk: Shrek 4...is worse...
<NiceDay> if people want to listen to a good song while waiting go to mae awakening on youtube
<Jake[NLR]> <3
<RainShadow> I haven't seem the Jetsons movie in years! I own it on VHS

<Tovler|Drunk> Kanda|How2TameUrCat: will hate Jetsons: The Movie.
<AlchemyGold> And I've heard mixed reviews on Shrek 4
<J_E_Smith71> ObLiCody: This movie event happens every Friday. The special marathon event we have after the movies will be five hours
<SirGanjalf> Well, i was never a fan of Jetsons, but i'll give this movie a chance. Maybe it's one of those
<Jake[NLR]> :O
<RainShadow> Ryu: animated.
<Jake[NLR]> <_<
<flutterlove123> ME TOO I MISS DERPY
<Thunder_Crescent> im going to goo get some hot donuts brb
<twilight_sprinkle> meh, something about dreamworks' style just doesnt let me experience any feels with their movies
<Ryunosuke> what?
<J_E_Smith71> Ninoyiya_Ryu: Animated
<Gumri> 0_0 there's a top 10 ponies later... God damn it's already half one in the morning... Do i want to pull an all nighter like i did for season 2? Yes, yes I do.
<Dr_Fumbles> Tovler|Drunk: 3 was good, and 4 was good, but neither lives up to the first two
<Tovler|Drunk> VenHur: I heard Shrek 4ever after was better.
<Jump> haha, NiceDay, I think I heard that song on an animation once
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> SirGanjalf: all i can remember from that movie is out dated CGI
<SilentSage2> I would stay up, but I have a party to attend tomorrow after ponies.
<FriendshipIsRarity> Come on credits.
<BlazeAngel> BALLS OF STEVEN KING
<SirGanjalf> *-"so-bad-that's-good" movies.
<Jake[NLR]> DERPY! NOW!6_9:P
<FriendshipIsRarity> Go away.
<Ninoyiya_Ryu> Ohhhhh, okay I thought that they made a live action version
<flutterlove123> WHO WANTS DOUNUTS
<Dr_Fumbles> 4 was better
<derpyderpderpderp1> bronies are best fans
<RainShadow> I'm not a big Dreamworks guy, but they hit it out of the park with this movie.
<Rapidfire> dounuts :D
<VenHur> Yeah, I agree, 4 was better...
<MakerDusk> derpyderpderpderp1: duh
<BlazeAngel> SirGanjalf: Like babes in toyland?
<FlaschenJoe11> I'm gonna watch the Discord version of the "See you out there" scene from TNG's final Episode "All Good Things..."
<Ryunosuke> i heard a ping, did someone need me?
<thelonepony> BlazeAngel: you still dont have + hat on :D

<NiceDay> cool Jump, i think its a great song
<CubanAmericanBrony> Such a beautiful soundtrack :)
<FriendshipIsRarity> Sticks and Stones.
<Rapidfire> oyi im going to have to get used to the faces
<SirGanjalf> PaladinDrakkenwolf: Oh, it was made in CGI era? ...:|
<Tovler|Drunk> Dr_Fumbles: Well, Shrek 1 was overrated and shrek 2 was almost too good.
<Dr_Fumbles> flutterlove123: meh
<BlazeAngel> thelonepony: Shaddup.
<EQUINE_excite> I thought 3 and 4 were stories that didn;t have to be told
<VenHur> ...Speaking of, is it me? Or it is the 3 movies that is always the bad ones of the bunch?
<pony_4942> kodak
<bronyguitarist> hot hot hot
<twilight_sprinkle> also turning the dragon into a kitten was cheap, might as well just play kitten videos from youtube
