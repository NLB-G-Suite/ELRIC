<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: I said immortal, not a vampire.
<MrBen> Hey, now I think about it, Blackerella sounds like it'd be hilarious. Get an all black cast, and totally replace the setting from this to a Chicago or New York ghetto. IT WOULD BE BRILLIANT.
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Actually it's a TV film
<Conyst> night GilDash
<MrBen> BROADWAY, HERE WE COME

<Everlasting_Joy> AssaultWithEmbraces: You wonder why I like this room?
<Yozhel> NOTHING'S TOO AKWARD IN BRONYSTATE
<VenHur> ...Forgive me!
<Rex_Ivan> he's not a prince. He's a kungfu master
<Skandranon> where all the love and tolerance bronies?
<Trollestia> THEY WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER
<Toronto_Brony> Ugh, THIS IS HORRIBLE! WHY AM I STILL WATCHING!?
<Madviking> at least it does teach girls that only white girls can be princesses
<pony_300> I'm thinking they threw all these roles into a random ehticity generator program.
<J_E_Smith71> GUYS, as I've said 50,000,000 times, prepare for a lot of singing because this is a 90s adapation of a 1950s musical
<pony_6587> What movie is this?
<Tovler> ugh. This movie is lush
<fluttercry> 05,15This is going swell ain't it
<Kinixys> Is Whoopi the fairy godmother?
<pony_980> ive always wondered how people would react if someon ACTUALLY went around town just randomly singing to themselves
<NullRadix> alright, on a scale of 1 to 10, how imperative is it that one sees Wreck it Ralph?
<QBAlchemist> i feel like everyones faces are a little too close to the camera
<Tomo> we should do a fan-dub
<pony_numbers> WHAT!? :[
<TheSplixer72> Asian Prince in Spain? SEEMS LEGIT.

<alicupcake1235> :(: what a nice harmony
<mart> People: Why are they singing? People: I don't know, but let just ignore.
<MrPine23> I think the best part will be the singing and music.
<Filly> Asian prince x Black cinderella? How about NO
<Buytoast> i haven't even seen it and i know it's a 10
<Bloxx> Kinixys: LOL
<Tovler> The random races I see here are the white ones.
<Snowi> This reminds me of fantastic movie ...
<Meanwhile> Do you expect any better from mane chat nowadays fluttercry?
<coinflip2> i like the diversity of the cast.

<fluttercry> 05,15AssaultWithEmbraces you're not alone
<Everlasting_Joy> AssaultWithEmbraces: No, you are reasonable in that thought.
<Zamer> Plus the actual correct term is colorist, since every person in the film is a homeosapian which is the race which we know as humans
<HoosierPony> yay
<Conyst> he is very strange
<OohShiny> she slave
<EnoughAsh2> despite waht i said earlier... is this movie being intentionally racist or just kinda poor wording?

<Kencolt> Endhiran was a Bollywood film. Like almost any film from there, it attempts to cram in everything it can-- action, comedy, tragedy, romance, and lavish musical numbers-- att in one film. In India, people need that level of escapism.

<Dtox> Vinyl_Wub: bad singing?
<Midnight_Fyre> I like your thinking, Ish. This coming from a guy who hates death metal
<Cirno> foot fetish much?
<Madviking> SNIFF THE SLIPPER
<Trollestia> But a TERIIBLE musical
<OohShiny> why the glass slipper didn't vanish?

<AssaultWithEmbraces> A literal glass slipper would break and slice someone's foot open
<coinflip2> edible boots ftw
<KrazyNoobs> ME GUSTA
<DudeManGuy> HOLD IT!
<J_E_Smith71> Trollestia: Funny enough this is going on Broadway next year
<Trollestia> What would happen if we did the Sound of Music as a movie?
<KrazyNoobs> ME SHOESTA
<Zompony> TAKE THAT
<CrystalPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354335097243.jpg
<Firelight> *Faps to Slipper*

<QBAlchemist> rubbish!
<Dtox> Pony_1374 logic? unheard of!
<KrazyNoobs> REAL SPEAKING!!! :D
<pony_1374> unless its just the slipper. then my idea is moot
<Kencolt> And then, the Prince, realisiing that person so bucking stupid as to wear a glass slipper to a huge dance existed, any kids of theirs were going to be morons and the kingdom would bge doomed. So he married the sensible baker from across teh street. The end.

<twilight_squirtle> KrazyNoobs: bit.ly is better though
<thelonepony|BL2> Reikim: how about this, we drink when chat says something smart
<pony_1374> nothing worse than a Barney the Dinosaur musical
<Dtox> thesplixer72: we get it, you can stop now.
<Cirno> so much feet. the prince must be in paradice
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I think it goes by "Stick by stick, building it together" or something like that
<Deacon> don't wory folks, almost over, hold your horses
*DinkyDoo Turns back on
<DRHUnleashed> plastic = glass apparently
<QBAlchemist> because no one else has the same shoe size
<tavi_lover> socks with highheels?
<coinflip2> I WANT PONIES!!!
<Midnight_Fyre> that sounds like a safe game
<Reikim> See, I'm not a teetotaler either.
<OohShiny> amatobrony: because the prince is dumb, like all princes
<KrazyNoobs> derpy.me is better. more pony
<Skandranon> yup every girl in the world has a different sized foot
<Firelight> People's feet were big back then...

<Reikim> Art of the Dress was based on a different song.
<IshPonyPonyThePony> the square root of pi is 1.7724538509055160.......
<Reikim> By some singer.
<DocSane> In the original story, the step sisters sliced off their toes to make their feet fit.
<DudeManGuy> so there's absolutely nobody else in this kingdom with the same shoe size?

<DocSane> They were repaid by Cinderella's friends, the birds, who flew down and pecked out their eyes.
<mart> I'll imagine he pick the little girl. lolz
<Reikim> I forget who, but it was a song about being an artist, and the trials that implied.
<Rookeealding> Does love make shoes fit now?

<AJIsAwesome> AssaultWithEmbraces: Well, Shining does give good examples why she's that way even thought that's not true. Cadance has just been telling him this to cover her for her being Chrysalis.
