<jpony> APPLAUSE!
<Silverscreen> 12RANDOM GENIE TRIVIA: While filming this movie, Robin Williams frequently received calls from Steven Spielberg who at the time was working on Schindler's List (1993). He would put him on speaker phone so he could tell jokes to the cast and crew to cheer them up. Some of the material that he used was material that he was using for this film.

<Rotwang> WOLVERINE!
<jpony> thou shalt not kill
<Silverscreen> 12RANDOM SONG TRIVIA: In the preview screenings for the movie, nobody applauded after the big song numbers. The animators wanted applause and so somebody stuck the Genie with an "Applause" sign at the end of "Friend Like Me". The joke worked and the sign was kept for the movie.

<King_Dedede> *munch*
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Production designer Richard Vander Wende devised a simple color scheme for the film, inspired by its desert setting. Blue (water) stands for good, red (heat) for evil, and yellow (sand) is neutral. For example, the villainous Jafar is clad in blacks and reds, while the virtuous Jasmine wears blue.
<Roleplay4life> 5I just realized how close some of the line counts are in chatstats. O:

<Silverscreen> 11Robin Williams provided the voice for the Genie, at union scale rate (the lowest legal pay rate a studio can give an actor), on the provisos that his voice was not used for merchandising (i.e. toys and such) and that the Genie character not take up more than 25% of the space of a poster, ad, billboard, or trailer. When these wishes were not granted,
<Silverscreen> 11. When these wishes were not granted, he withdrew his support for Disney and the film. As a result, his name was not included in "The Art of Aladdin" book (it makes constant references to "the voice of the Genie"), and he was not available for the direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar (1994) (V) or the "Aladdin" (1994) TV show (Dan Castellaneta filled in

<Silverscreen> 11In an attempt to get back on good terms with Williams, Walt Disney Co. CEO Michael Eisner apologized to him with a peace offering of an originalPablo Picasso painting. Still angered and feeling betrayed by Disney, Williams would not accept the gift.
<jpony> Robin Williams is a pretty cool guy
<Silverscreen> 11It was not until Jeffrey Katzenberg was fired and a new producer hired did Williams return to Disney. Through this new producer, a public apology was given (by the producer).

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM JAFFAR TRIVIA: Andreas Deja based Jafar on Marc Davis's design for Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty (1959). The two villains share more than just looks: both carry a staff which they use to execute evil magic; both have bird henchman (Maleficent's is a raven, Jafar's a parrot), and both turn themselves into gigantic animals in their film's climax.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Originally, the peddler who introduces the movie would be revealed to be the Genie at the end - hence the fact that Robin Williams voiced him, too. Notice the similarities in the design of the two, especially the eyebrows, the beard and the four-fingered hands. (All the other human characters have five fingers.)
<Darf14> He ate them...and hes going to eat me!!! OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDD!!!!
