<Ingwaz> i do play the ocarina atm...sort of...if the iphone ocarina app counts and i only know LoZ songs on it
<Everlasting_Joy> Good night emangamer.
<Everlasting_Joy> Ingwaz that would be the first thing I'd learn on the ocarina.
<Dken2021> wonder what was the backstory in that pic? did dash injure her wings or she got too old?
<Ingwaz> indeed Everlasting_Joy, first ones i learned was saria's song, zelda's lullaby and requiem of light
<Placebo> Dken2021: Looks like old and deathbed.
<Placebo> OMG
<Placebo> SO SAD
<Placebo> T_T
<Placebo> ;.;
<Ingwaz> havent been using it much though so i forgot requiem of light...
<Kencolt> Well, the music for the Lunar Silver Star Story Complete has some very nice ocarina tunes...
<PartyCannon> Dken2021 she's definitely older; there's a pic of her at a younger age in the background~
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> WHY?
<Everlasting_Joy> Ingwaz, isn't it the Prelude of Light? Either way, :D
<Saturn> 8,1Ingwaz: all i'll say is that if you want to learn the cello, don't be tempted to buy an el cheapo £100 ebay instrument
*Placebo is extremely sad now
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Why is Dashie homeless?
<Saturn> 8,1even i couldn't get a decent sound out of those things
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> And why do I want that pic?!?
<Placebo> Damn you, SB
<Saturn> 8,1i can get a good sound out of a £300 stentor cello, though
<MahBoi777> kinda reminds me of MLD
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> yes
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> it does
<Ingwaz> prelude, requiem, w/e, i forgot, its requiem of shadow i knew, i was learning prelude of light, but didnt mess with it too much

<ScootaChicken> our teaching fell of his bike
<Simon> In case some of you silly fillies missed it, test.du.cx
<ScootaChicken> but when we saw him yesterday it looked like he got mauled by a tiger or something...
<MahBoi777> ScootaChicken: wow really?
<ScootaChicken> yeah, I've got a feeling that there's something about his life he's not telling us
<MahBoi777> ScootaChicken: *secretly a stuntman*

<Phase4> nvm actualy, i have something i need to do first *derp*
<Simon2> lol
<Simon2> too bad it's night here, and it's generally midnight in this state
<Simon> Minecraft Server closed :(
<Saturn> 08,01back again
<Saturn> 08,01it derped
<otakon> dat derpage
<Phase4> silly windows
<Phase4> those files are broken, why are you trying to load them
<unfoundbug> Windows does try hard sometimes
<Phase4> it actualy worries me that its loading them
<Phase4> its vista which had driver signing, loading broken files is a problem
<Saturn> 08,01minecraft is back
<unfoundbug> ah man, last time i saw that server i got 1.5gb of footage
<Phase4> Saturn: windows 7 boot dvd, hangs on a black screen with a cursor. ideas?
<unfoundbug> also, has the ip changes, cause i can't see it
<Phase4> windows vista (shudder) is on the hdd
*Jim is going home
<unfoundbug> you should be able to run the boot CD from within vista
<Phase4> later Jim
<Jim> bai Phase4
<Phase4> unfoundbug: i'm trying to recover the vista install, its broke
<unfoundbug> your recovering byusing a windows 7 cd?
<Phase4> well i dont have a vista iso
*Nyria is using windows vista~
<Phase4> :<
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: use linux
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<Phase4> i wish that worked
<Phase4> avg's kernel components were crashing windows
<Phase4> used a ubuntu disk to delete them
<Phase4> now crcdisk.sys is crashing windows
<unfoundbug> Its impressive how much you have broken windows
<Saturn> 08,01windows is a good operating system, so long as you don't install any programs, load any drivers, or use it
<Phase4> its not my pc
<Phase4> what Saturn said
<Saturn> 08,01first course of action: truy a different windows dvd?
<Phase4> dont have another,unless you count the windows 8 beta
<Saturn> 08,01tried it out yet?
<Phase4> nope
<DJMidgetBrony> Hey look
<DJMidgetBrony> a night when Phase4 didnt ping me
<DJMidgetBrony> :p
<Phase4> wow
<DJMidgetBrony> \o/
<Phase4> that DJ thing works
<DJMidgetBrony> Yes it does
<DJMidgetBrony> And its not like I dont actually DJ so its a win/win
<Phase4> :)
*DJMidgetBrony fads back into the shadows
<Phase4> dat fading
*Jim is home
<Phase4> ohai Jim
<Jim> how's it going Phase4? :)
<Phase4> its good
<Rain> >have class at 1pm
<Rain> >normaly wake up at 11:30
<Rain> >wake up at 6:30
<Jim> oh fun
<Rain> >dad fucking yells at you for not waking up fucking earlier!
<Rain> >throw table at dads head
<Lyra`> hi, bye
<Jim> I always wake up briefly a few hours before I'm supposed to wake up, feeling fantastic
<Rain> Fuck you dad I woke up 5 hours earlier than normal you ungratefull fuck!
<Lyra`> ignore me, just passiing thru
<Jim> then I go to sleep for an hour or two, and then I feel terrible
<Jim> Don't worry about it Rain, he's probably just pulling your leg
<Phase4> i'm up at 6 every day
<Rain> What is worse? He has /nothing/ for me to do today
<Phase4> every single day
<Phase4> like clockwork
<Rain> and no he isnt. He said "If you cant get yourself up in the morning how do you expect to be able to go to another state and go to colledge!?"
<Jim> You should do this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SPV9F5w7Ww
<Rain> Im sitting there thinking "Why say shit like that when I woke up 6 1/2 hours before class?"
<otakon> wait
<Jim> I usualy wake up half an hour before class, and I do fine
<otakon> he's giving you grief
<otakon> for waking up at the CRACK OF DAWN?
<otakon> ......
<Rain> he does it all the fucking time though
*otakon facepalms
<Jim> That must be quite annoying for you Rain
<Rain> I do the dishes. "Oh god we are all going to die of food poisioning"
<Rain> I clean the rabbits "You are slower than the second coming!" which they say because they know I am agnostic
<Rain> anything I do is returned with "Do fucking better!"
<Jim> That's just mean
<Rain> when I do all of those things 3x better than they ever could!
<Rain> Im in colledge right now and my dad never even finished high school! Fuck him and his supiriority complex!
<Jim> Well, what I think they do, is that they're trying to push you towards always doing your best
<Rain> I push myself. They try to trip me up. They always have.
<otakon> okay
<Rain> I never had a problem doing anything by myself and then I move in whith them and suddenly Im fucking mentally handicapped and cant even eat breakfast by myself.
<otakon> there is one thing for pushing yourself
<otakon> and another for impossible goals
<otakon> you can't please everyone
<otakon> take MY mother for example
<otakon> I cook rice all the time
<otakon> she says I have it too high on simmer
<otakon> there are some people you cannot please no matter what sadly
<Rain> Im not allowed to cook because I will "burn the house down" =____________=
<otakon> they will ALWAYS point out whatever flaws you have regardless of the severity of them
<Rain> they point out flaws that dont exist
<otakon> I got grief for not wiping up a few drops of tea
<otakon> that landed on the stovetop whilst I was making it
<otakon> that essentially turned into the entire stovetop
<otakon> being scrubbed down and maintenance
<Rain> Im anal retentive and make the kitchen /spotless/ and they /still/ say that we are going to get ants or some shit like that.
<Rain> I keep my room spotless and they walk in every day and turn up their noses "why isnt your room clean? It looked like this yesterday."
<Rain> I walk into their room and there is empty food bowls and trash everywhere! WTF!?
<Rain> they have no room to talk down to me!
<Rain> oh.... s-sorry about that guys... for venting... I just dont want to end up breaking my dads nose so I tend to vent when he does this shit...
<Jim> That's ok, everyone needs to vent once in a while :)
<Rain> They both just... make my blood boil...
<Rain> Im glad I dont own a baseball bat...
<KetaminaDianePie> i wish i knew english better to talk about your parents Rain
<Rain> Bile slinging cunts is how I feel about them right now.
*Phase4 does not like anger
<Rain> I catch them talking behind my back and they wonder why I give them a look for it
<pony_8885> am i supposed to be seeing something here?
<Rain> This isnt anger. Its 6 years of pent up rage.
<KetaminaDianePie> at least there are less chances you grow up and be a lazy good for nothing scumbag..........
<KetaminaDianePie> :(
<Rain> Only because I have seen what that looks like and /I/ push myself to not become it.
<KetaminaDianePie> i wish i had more severe parents
<Rain> My parents arent the ones who raised me. /I/ raised myself. I have only lived with them for 5-6 years and they think they can claim that they raised me
<KetaminaDianePie> they almost let me do whatever i want...... and thats bad
<Rain> when they found out that I was agnostic they said "Thats not how we raised you!"
<Jim> Oh...They're that kind of parents who think they can tell their kids what to think and believe, I see
<Rain> Before these parents I could always do what I wanted. I never did though because I hated the idea of growing up to be like them.
<Rain> I mean... come on... parenting... yeah you need to... push your child to do better... but when they do good... you need to atleast... say "good job"... once in a while...
<otakon> agreed
<Rain> I have never... heard anything... but... "why havent you done this better yet?"
<Rain> . . . .
<Rain> Im going to college for game design.... and every week they... come to me with an ad for some college... "you could be an archiologist" or "you could be a teacher" or "you could do something that you will hate so much that you eventually kill yourself"... They dont apriciate the fact that I /know/ what I want to do... and have known since I was 8...
<otakon> well
<otakon> don't let it get to you
<Rain> do you know how many people go to college and dont know what they want to do...?
<otakon> um
<Rain> most of them
<otakon> tons of them I'd guess
<Rain> exactly
<Jim> You should do what you like to, you don't need your parents approval to be happy
<Rain> I know that. . .
<Rain> I just wish they would show a little bit of pride in how much I push myself...
<Rain> even if they dont deserve to say "I raised that kid"
<Rain> I would still be happy if they said that to someone...
<Rain> they never talk about me or what I do to their friends...
<Rain> Im a damn math wizard and they look down on me because I have a problem with language...
<Rain> When I do my chores I go a little slower than they would like... but only because I make sure I do the chore the right way... all they see though is me being lazy and good for nothing...
<Rain> I... need to go... be alone for a while... I... I will talk to you all... later...
<Rain> sorry about this...
<Jim> Alright, take care Rain

<LunaTheBeloved> I loved Israel "IZ" Kamakawiwoʻole
<ofna01> yeah
<LunaTheBeloved> He was so good
<ofna01> if he wasnt so,er,big,he would be a lot more popular i think
*Rain shrugs "he is ok I guess"
<ofna01> because some people just glance at him and dont even listen
<kevinsano> I've known this song since forever
<kevinsano> how old is it
<Rain> retarded stoner fags ruined him for me though
<LunaTheBeloved> I don't care how a person looks, its there muzik that makes me like them
<Rain> ^
<Rain> unless their fans are terrible
<ofna01> luna,that is exactly how i feel
<Rain> I hate fans
<ofna01> /)
<ofna01> brohoof
<LunaTheBeloved> (\
<ofna01> /)(\
<Jim> I like Bob Marley, it's just that his music's been connected to drugs that I mislike
<Jim> dislike*
<kevinsano> meh, unagreeable reason for me
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah, I don't personally like Bob Marley as a person, but I enjoy his muzik
<ofna01> they played somewhere over the rainbow at my friends funeral
<ofna01> marley is long gone,una
<LunaTheBeloved> I know heis
<emangamer> Hi, everypony

<KetaminaDianePie> hey there!
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello eman
<Rain> I used to like bob but then retarded stonerfags (those ones that walk around saying "hey I smoke pot look how cool I am") ruined him for me...
<ofna01> somewhere over the rainbow holds a special meaning for me
<ofna01> they played it at my friends funeral
<KetaminaDianePie> T^T
*Rain doesnt link songs to death
<ofna01> well,it reminds me of him
<kevinsano> don't let people ruin that stuff for you Rain
*Rain doesnt link emotions to death either :\
<LunaTheBeloved> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2VCwBzGdPM Why do not have good muzik nowadays?
<KetaminaDianePie> because dubstep
<ofna01> i still listen to that alot
<KetaminaDianePie> hahahaaha
<LunaTheBeloved> I mean there are a few new ones that are good.
<ofna01> dubstep sucks
<Rain> ^
<ofna01> tbh
<xcanox> ^
<Rain> SO HARD
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved you old bean, how did you sleep?
<LunaTheBeloved> But all the popular ones are terrible
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzLnDz87IN8
<LunaTheBeloved> And yes Dubstaep is terrible
<xcanox> Dubstep is the sound that is produced when a Dicepticon violates an Autobot in the plot.
<kevinsano> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsZBX2RhDZE
<LunaTheBeloved> Tally ho emangamer, I slept perfectly old chap, and you my good sir?
<emangamer> IDK, alex S makes dupstep pretty legit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BseyCNMQBc
<KetaminaDianePie> ahahahaahahahahahahahaha xcanox
<kevinsano> I kinda like dubstep :<
<Rain> I hate listening to the radio because it plays the same crap over and over again on a 2 hour loop
<kevinsano> it reminds me of chiptunes in a way
<kevinsano> so obviously electronic
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: I am ashamed to say that I pined for the companionship of someone last night, but I had aquired my Pinkie Pie figure and all was well.
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86ReVJhJCA
<emangamer> Rain: IKR....its so fucking annoying
<Tovler> I've found myself liking dubstep that isn't "filthy"
<alexxm> any see that video of that lady freaking out about owls last night
<emangamer> HO GOD... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QodrSfsboFk&feature=related
<emangamer> watch that
<emangamer> now
<KetaminaDianePie> wooooo Mtropolis! neeato!
<Rain> I found myself hating dubstep fans because they thing any form of techno = dubstep
<xcanox> >implying dubstep isn't filthy in pure form
<LunaTheBeloved> emangamer, you you mind old bean, if we stopped talking fancy?
<emangamer> the top comments on that are amazing
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpl6ncyxLGw
<LunaTheBeloved> I'm a southerner, its too hardd
<ofna01> my sisters talkin fancy!
<Rain> and I find that a good chair to the side of the head shuts them up very well
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: nah.....I was tust twantin to act like fancy somtimes...
<ofna01> LOL!
<EspyLacopa> So, what is wrong with dubstep?
<ofna01> its retarded
<Rain> What is wrong with it imo
<EspyLacopa> That's an opinion, not a fact.
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: I'm from the south, and I dont have a problem with it
<EspyLacopa> I'm looking for facts.
<xcanox> LunaTheBeloved: When I was just a little boy, standin' to my daddy's knee, my papa said "Son, don't let the man get ya, do what he done to me."
<ofna01> oh look i can hit buttons derp derp derp ddhhahaha
<LunaTheBeloved> I just can't do it
<xcanox> LunaTheBeloved: "Cuz he'll get ya. Oh he'll get ya now."
<EspyLacopa> Again ofna01, that's an opinion, not a fact.
<Rain> is that I have not met a single fan of it who knows what is and what is not dubstep EspyLacopa
<ofna01> there's no FACT why dubstep sucks
<xcanox> LunaTheBeloved: Born on a bayou.
<ofna01> it just does
<emangamer> OK, here is my opinion on dubstep. The light stuff sucks, but the heavier stuff is really good. For example Ales S's CMC theme remix is about as light as I can get without me getting bored
<xcanox> And I can remember the 4th of July, runnin' through the backwood, bare.
<emangamer> IT all depends on how that artist approaches it
<EspyLacopa> So dubstep, in fact, is not bad music. You just don't like it.
<ofna01> if i go crazy then will you still call me superman?
<xcanox> And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin', chasin' down a hoodoo there.
<LunaTheBeloved> See, this is a newer band that I really enjoy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KkUeRPjc-Y
<ofna01> KRYPTONIIITE
<Rain> I was listening to SandStorm and some fuck walks up and says "I didnt know you liked dubstep!" I swung a chair at his face for it.
<LunaTheBeloved> Great lyrics, and great muzik
<LunaTheBeloved> Perfect combo
*EspyLacopa is reminded of every adult ever thinking their kids music is just horrible noise that should be banned.
<EspyLacopa> And thusly, the cycle continues.
<emangamer>
<Rain> I dont mind if someone listens to it
<ofna01> i sorta agree with the adults on dubstep
<ofna01> XD
<xcanox> emangamer: y u do dis?
<EspyLacopa> Emangamer, whats with the dead space there?
<emangamer> ofna01: like I said, it all depends on the artist
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpl6ncyxLGw
<emangamer> EspyLacopa: idk.. my tabfill just fucked up
<ofna01> one of my favorite songs
<Rain> I just get reeeeeeeally pissed when somone calls the stuff I listen to dubstep
<KetaminaDianePie> Rain Sandstorm OOOOOWWWWW YEEEEAH!
<emangamer> ofna01: /]
<alexxm> anyone heard black stone cherry
<kevinsano> what do you listen to Rain
<emangamer> that song is really really good
<Tovler> I need to hear more Dubstep before I can have a real opinion.
<ofna01> what emangamer
<emangamer> ofna01: /]
<ofna01> brohoof?
<emangamer> I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
<ofna01> /)(\
<ofna01> yesh
<Rain> I listen to trance, electronica, house, DnB, orchistral, and chiptune
<ofna01> what about light rock?
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved and ofna01 http://mixermike622.deviantart.com/art/Epic-Brohoof-251293200
<Rain> and people think that is dubstep :\
<emangamer> it's not dubstep if at least 2 windows dont break during the song
<KetaminaDianePie> IKR!
<ofna01> LOL
<Tovler> Now this is my kind of music. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDNdFugsw1o
<Rain> Fuck that emangamer
<ofna01> nope Tovler
<emangamer> Rain: it was a joke
<ofna01> exited the tab when i saw the name
<Rain> I listen to techno songs all the time that would blow you out of your home
<Tovler> ofna01: This isn't my kind of music.
<alexxm> this is my kind of music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-I8ALlYxdY
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBMT3OMEPwk
<Rain> dubstep is just retarded synth and a beat. nothing more.
<LunaTheBeloved> Tovler, See if you enjoy this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T--j0_yxBaY&ob=av2e
<ofna01> ignore the band name,just listen
<emangamer> I would re-link Alex S.'s dubstep but I feel like i've been enough of a whore for him already
<KetaminaDianePie> and its fukkin slooooooooooow
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBMT3OMEPwk
<emangamer> now everypony needs to listen to this song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV_0n5gp1fE&feature=BFa&list=PL714A1D4F144412EE&lf=mh_lolz

<emangamer> ugh...5 finger death punch...
<LunaTheBeloved> I love Florence + The Machine
<ofna01> i said ignore the name
<LunaTheBeloved> I liked them before that PMV
<ofna01> their usually metal,but this isnt metal
<Tovler> LunaTheBeloved: Blue eyed funk? That song is actually awesome.
<emangamer> GOD DAMN...this is one of THE BEST PMV's ever made
<ofna01> what eman?
<Rain> uuugh emangamer I hate that song

<emangamer> Rain: but the PMV is just SOOOOOO good
<Tovler> And the unicorn is relevant to my interests
<LunaTheBeloved> Tovler lol
<Rain> emangamer I dont care about the pmv I care about the music. Quite frankly. I hate this song.

*emangamer gives TOY_PON32 his tophat and presents a shiney new monocle
<Rain> emangamer tell me a single dubstep artist who has multi platinum recognition and is the role leader of an entire genre of music.
<emangamer> Rain: that's not possible, its too new of a genre
<TOY_PON32> I wish but I need to go to school in a few
<emangamer> TOY_PON32: do you like my gift?
<KetaminaDianePie> nooo
<TOY_PON32> Thanks emangamer :3
*TOY_PON32 puts them on
<emangamer> this is what TOY_PON32 looks like right now: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/588/
<emangamer> quite right
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoBE69wdSkQ <-- Wait, I've got it! This is dubstep!
<TOY_PON32> Ahh yes :3
<Tovler> (If I post my favorite song… aw fuck it.) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yQgciCLaWU
<Rain> emangamer, the only well named creator of dubstep is skrillex and he has said that he is not a dubstep artist. and his award winning music was his techno and DnB not his dubstep
<emangamer> Rain: have i once mentioned the name skrillex?
<emangamer> EspyLacopa: this is dubstep, and it actually a pretty good song
<Rain> I was pointing out that he is the only well known dubstep artist emangamer
<emangamer> Rain: I dont like him
<Tovler> inb4 Justin Bieber releases a Dubstep album.
<Rain> exactly
<ofna01> oh god
<TOY_PON32> ...
<emangamer> I do like some of Flux pavillions stuff though
<TOY_PON32> ^
<Rain> that would be the day that music died Tovler
<emangamer> he can be good, but some of of his stuff sucks
<ofna01> i want to stab justin bieber repeatedley
<LunaTheBeloved> Back
<TOY_PON32> Hey LunaTheBeloved
<Rain> I dont hate bieber. I hate his fans
<emangamer> I'm still waiting for Bill Gates to buy Beiber's copyright
<TOY_PON32> Yeah I agree with Rain

<TOY_PON32> ^
*EspyLacopa is listening to william tell overture still
<Rain> Bieber is a good singer (if he would lose the autotune) but GOD DAMN if his fans dont make me want to drown kittens
<emangamer> Rain: listen to this song, I will promise you will like it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=563QnEAGGOA
<Tovler> I've never heard his music.
<EspyLacopa> Who's Bieber again?
<LunaTheBeloved> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpFUc8ABDMQ Glad to see we're still on muzik
<Rain> what will you pay me if I dont like it emangamer?
<Tovler> I'm pretty sure his stuff doesn't get played on the radio
<emangamer> Rain: no, because it's impossible to not like it in the first 15 seconds
<TOY_PON32> Bieber's fans will do anything to meet him...and I mean everything. It's fucking scary.
<emangamer> because the beginning of the song is the best
<ofna01> does this count as dubstep? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBMMkknN-Zg&feature=related
<EspyLacopa> TOY_PON32: As scary as what Elvis Presley fans did?
<Rain> well it is 40 seconds in and I havent heard a single thing I like about it emangamer

<otakon> Kencolt: true, but he doesn't really have that killer instinct
<pony_5560> but no jelly beans
<Jim> I wish I had beans.
<Kencolt> The point is... he's not meant to have a killer instinct.
<pony_5560> bad ass if he did
<otakon> oh SO wrong
<Fazana> Uwrongbro
<otakon> you NEVER say it couldn't get worse
<otakon> EVER!
<otakon> in ANY situation
<Kencolt> Ranma
<otakon> the universe will smite you for it
<Tovler> otakon: I learned that from watching Splice.
<Fazana> Break a pinkie promise, now it will never get worse
<Kencolt> Ranma's first Law. "Hell YES it can get worse."
<otakon> damn
<otakon> I haven't watched Ranma in YEARS
<otakon> like that show
<Jim> Murphy's Law: Everything that can go wrong will at some point go wrong
<otakon> although the fanservice is confusing
<otakon> guess who that voice is?
<alexxm> the joker
<Kencolt> The manga is far superior.
<pony_5560> WHAT
<otakon> I haven't read it
<Tovler> 100 sons? Firelord's been busy
<pony_5560> really?
<otakon> sadly
<Sumica> 00,10burn it all
<Fazana> "No bender is superior?"
<Kencolt> Got every volume.

<otakon> CORRECT!
<pony_5560> dam i wanted to catch up on the mlp episodes, but im only on ep 4 Season 1
<otakon> and Ozai would wing
<Kencolt> I was famous for a Ranma fanfic... "Girl Days", under the penname Kenko.
<otakon> ahem win
<Fazana> Pops would probably ein
<Fazana> win8
<otakon> Kencolt: what was the premise?
<Kencolt> Basically... how do I put this...
<otakon> LOL
<Sumica> 00,10group hugs
<alexxm> captain planet
<Tovler> It was weird how Father was randomly some fire elemantal/demon/ or w/e
<pony_5560> DAM
<pony_5560> er
<otakon> Tovler: it was a suit he wore
<Kencolt> Okay. . Ranma has this problem with water. Now... there was a lot of fics that had him dealing with his "Feminine side"-- and they were all more or less grimdark. Deep psychological epics.
<otakon> Well I know that much about Ranma
<LunaTheBeloved> Over as in dead
<Kencolt> But I thought, "The series is mainly a comedy. So... how would Takahasi do it?"
<Tovler> otakon: I must been in the military when that was revealed.
<otakon> Tovler: you were in the military? good on ya!
<otakon> I LOVE THIS BIT! so much
<Jim> The Melon Lord?

<Dark_Horst> FIST BAD GUYS
<MahBoi777> pawnch
<alexxm> so whats this game about
<Dark_Horst> knuckle the knuckleheads
<Wrek> 05its not recoil
<Wrek> 05its reload
<MahBoi777> melee the mutants
<Wrek> 05its a 1 hadned lever action shotgun
<Dark_Horst> from what i see, the reaload animation comes after the recoil and is less than half as long as the recoil
<Dark_Horst> i could be leaking dumb all over the place right now, but that's my viewpoint and i defend it with a pitchfork
<Wrek> 05you use the recoil to help propell the swing
<MahBoi777> Dark_Horst: lol
<TopHat> mfw I just slept for 16 hours...
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<MahBoi777> hai Tophat

<sonicrainboomer259> omg video games
<alexxm> the pokeball heals u
<MahBoi777> you're like Wolverine
<Dark_Horst> i like the crysis approach on the healing
<unfoundbug> rocket launcher took your leg off? that might take a second or 2 more
<Sumica> 00,10then again you proably could not take a rocket to the face eiter
<MahBoi777> unfoundbug: well except for Fallout
<Dark_Horst> healing in crysis is just your suit's capacitors reloading. everything below is toast
<unfoundbug> sheilds make sense in caps recharging
<unfoundbug> but the cods have no excuse
<Sumica> 00,10yeah in ME you have like no heath it's all shields

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat image
<Rain> lol
<unfoundbug> Lol, yes you did pinkie
*RAWRity is waiting for the day when they're the only one in chat, and can have a lengthy, public conversation with themself.j
<kirzstryfe> 1,3so, I'm pretty sure I've seen you all type these words out before, is anyone else having that same-day feeling?
<Saturn> 08,01i used to wonder what friendship could be
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: dat Deja Vu
<Purple`Prose> My Little Pony~
<Shizuka> 13same day feeling?
<RAWRity> ?
<Saturn> 08,01then i took an arrow to the knee
<DWR_Writing> Suddenly, Half-ops
*FreezeFrame shoots Saturn.
<Jim> oh you silly filly Saturn
<DWR_Writing> Saturn Die.
<unfoundbug> Saturn, you just caused hate in a society known for love and tolerance
<unfoundbug> youll die now
<RainbowcrashNBurn> now i feel like playing skyrim :D
<FreezeFrame> There's only one funny arrow to the knee joke, and it's this: http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lycc3oZrQW1qc9eqjo1_500.jpg
<String_Shredder> dat lazer
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm stuck in class all day it seems...
<unfoundbug> also, anyone else singing the eme song in their head with saturns new lyrics
<FreezeFrame> (Kyle Williams of the San Fran 49ers)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Also, I got some stupid questions wrong on my psychology quix
<SuperBrony64> 10,02quiz*
<Jim> unfoundbug: eeyup
<SuperBrony64> 10,02How was I supposed to know there was a difference between 'gender' and 'sex' ;A;
<RAWRity> anypony here ever heard of the band "Johnny Hobo and the Freight trains" before?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> unfoundbug: im too busy with flimflam brothers being stuck in my head
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: I knew that before I even took Psychology.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It's a dumb technicality IMO >_<
<unfoundbug> winter wrap up cleared that one pretty quickly
<RAWRity> not so much a technicality as it is rampant misuse of a word.
<StickySyrup> hello everypony
<unfoundbug> hi StickySyrup
<Jim> ohai StickySyrup
<StickySyrup> how are we all?
<ScootaChicken|work> RAWRity, I've heard of them
<SkilledSkillet> Great StickySyrup
<Jim> procrastiating as usual
<StickySyrup> nice
<RAWRity> most treat Sex and Gender as interchangeable words, but in a field that concerns the separation of the two, it's important to know the difference.
<String_Shredder> dat rayman
<Davie_Jones> Where is the person I spoke to yesterday about Phoenix Wright?
<ScootaChicken|work> what is the difference between gender and sex?
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken|work: neat. You ever listen to their live album?
<Phase4> ohello people, i'm distracted by another room
<Arentius> I assume one is the physical representation (male female) and the other is what they identify themselves as
<StickySyrup> RAWRity: Sex is the biological differences between man and woman. Gender is the physological difference, a more personal atribute
<ScootaChicken|work> nope RAWRity, whats it called?
<Davie_Jones> otacon!
<Arentius> HAH I WAS RIGHT
<Arentius> sorry >.>
<StickySyrup> i did politics =)
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken|work: "
<RAWRity> sorry
<Davie_Jones> Where is Otacon?
<RAWRity> "Caught in the act of Not Being Awesome" is the album title.
<StickySyrup> I actually came online to say goodnight... so goodnight everypony
<RAWRity> night sticky
<Phase4> night StickySyrup
<Davie_Jones> Someone help me. I'm stuck.
<Jim> goodnight StickySyrup
<StickySyrup> lol byebey =)
<SkilledSkillet> nacht StickySyrup
*Rain grabs Davie_Jones by the ankles and pulls on him
*Davie_Jones gives Rain a lot that says he's not in the mood for jokes.
<ScootaChicken|work> I'll check it out RAWRity
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Point is it's all Justin Biebers' fault
<String_Shredder> Rain is best beatles tribute
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Bill Gates really should fix that
<SuperBrony64> 10,02IKR
<SkilledSkillet> He should
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: fix what?
<Davie_Jones> grr.. he left...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3someone find RAWRity that tweet lol
<SuperBrony64> 10,02He should just buy Justin Bieber instead and force him to program indie games for the Xbox 360.

*Purple`Prose hums the Happy Birthday song and eats cake ^.^
<ScootaChicken|work> oh my god Bill Gates
<ScootaChicken|work> do it
<ScootaChicken|work> do it nao
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Happy birthday Purple`Prose :3
<Davie_Jones> I can't believe this! I'm stuck
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Can I has cake? :>
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i have new found respect for microsoft :P
<Davie_Jones> The game has a major fail in it!
<StinkomanFan> Suddenly sonic
<RAWRity> You know, Bieber would got away if people stopped constantly talking about how much they hate him.
<ScootaChicken|work> Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to Purple`Prose, happy birthday to you
<RAWRity> *go
<Arentius> is that bill gates tweet real...
<RaveBrony> This is true RAWRity :P
<Davie_Jones> Otacon!
<Phase4> ohai otakon
<RaveBrony> Are people still hating on that kid?
<String_Shredder> hey otakon
<DWR_Writing> otakon everytime i see your name. I either see the following: Oatakon, Otabakon or Oatbakon
<DWR_Writing> Don't even know why.
<unfoundbug> can't find a source for it
<Jim> ohai otakon
<Phase4> i misread that as 'Oat bat kon'
<StinkomanFan> Wow, sonic sure has gotten LOUD hasn't he?
<Phase4> wich sounds neat
*SlurryMoon huggles Purple`Prose
<RAWRity> Like, I honestly hadn't even HEARD of Bieber until I visited a Metal music forum FILLED with threads of people getting angry about him.
<SlurryMoon> 3Happy Birthday!
<otakon> I got DC'd
<Wrek> 05anyone knows waht http://e621.net/data/51/ae/51ae210b7aafa65132eaf4f602f08a3b.gif?1328179747 refers to? slightly on the darker side if you dont liek that stuff
<otakon> that's why I suddenly left and came back
<StinkomanFan> I came back to a game Yatzee loves and it switches to a game Yahtzee hates
<RaveBrony> Which rule of the internet is "The more you hate it, the stronger it gets"?
<StinkomanFan> Then again you could switch to any game and he'd hate it
<Phase4> brb
<DWR_Writing> Wrek looks like samus because of the orange ball...
<DWR_Writing> but thats all i can come up with.
<Rain> I recognise it Wrek but cant out my finger on it
<RAWRity> hell, the Bieber haters got "Baby" to the #1 viewed vid on YT because they started a campaign to Dislike it, giving him a fuckton of ad revenue in the process.
<unfoundbug> that tweet pic is fake, not on his twitter at all
<unfoundbug> laame
<RainbowcrashNBurn> RAWRity: wait...he got big because of the people that dont like him?
<RAWRity> unfoundbug: and you're surprised?
<unfoundbug> i was hoeful
<unfoundbug> hopeful*
<KernelCobb> He sure did, just like rebecca black
<Wrek> 05rule 0 of the internet: 99% is fake
<StinkomanFan> Trolls just hate Beiber because they Jelly :)
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Wrek: what if the rule is fake?
<unfoundbug> definately, however about 5% you wish was real
<RAWRity> RainbowcrashNBurn: pretty much. He got some popularity on YT, got picked up by a small label, and then EXPLODED in noteriety because of all the people ahting him.
<unfoundbug> same thing happened to rebecca black
<StinkomanFan> Ponies thrive on love JB thrives on hate
<StinkomanFan> go figure
<KernelCobb> ponies is best fandom
<RAWRity> Really, looking at the Billboard charts, he's not a very big name compared to most pop artists out there, but he gets tons of internet attention, mostly due to people flailing about how they hate him.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> RAWRity: which brings up a comment i constantly see on youtube "why go on a vid if you dont like what it is"
<KernelCobb> ^ million dollar question
<Wrek> 05cause haters are most often idiots
<kirzstryfe> 1,3does that mean there's a 99% chance SB is fake, or 99% of SB is fake?
<StinkomanFan> >99% is fake
<Wrek> 05hatters*
<RAWRity> RainbowcrashNBurn: I don't even agree with that. You're free to go onto what ever video you want, and then say what you want, but people who honestly just want him to fade away aren't doing themselves any favors by constantly talking shit about him.
<Jim> or the rule 0 was fake_
<StinkomanFan> >99% of the internet
<StinkomanFan> >Ponies are 50% of the internet
<StinkomanFan> :c
<Dken2021> ^I think that's true
<RAWRity> I mean, I hate to use this phrase but it's true; Haters Make Him Famous
<KernelCobb> ponies are everywhere on the internet
<Wrek> 05but ponies arent on the itnernet
<KernelCobb> what do you mean?
<Wrek> 05ponies are on the outernet, they jsut use the same portal
<unfoundbug> ponies ARE the internet
<StinkomanFan> Portal was once the internet, ponies are now the internet
<Jim> the internet is ponies
<KernelCobb> questionable logic, wrek, but i like it
<RainbowcrashNBurn> RAWRity: im just saying that why do people who dont like what they know is in the vid, even consider clicking onto it, is that just the length that trolls go to i guess
<StinkomanFan> and then something else will take it
<Wrek> 05EqD is in orbit around the moon
<KernelCobb> i agree with ranbowcrashnburn
<Wrek> 05usign a very logn cable
<StinkomanFan> Maybe the Forever Alone chap
<Wrek> 05which is why it takes ages to laod sometimes
<StinkomanFan> He wore the internet crown at one point
<Dken2021> what did I just walk into?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Wrek: just think urself lucky it aint wireless
<Jim> ohai Dken2021
<Dken2021> ello Jim
<KernelCobb> My friend showed me a vid "teens react to my little pony"
<StinkomanFan> At one point the Bronies will take over the moon
<StinkomanFan> Geneva convention be damned
<KernelCobb> One kid thought we were all just a bunch of trolls
<RainbowcrashNBurn> StinkomanFan: just to see if luna is there?
<StinkomanFan> Wait, you guys aren't trolling?
<KernelCobb> :)
<KernelCobb> nope
<Wrek> 05nah i watch it for the plot
<Jim> There's a rule that no nation can own the moon. It says nothing about individuals though.
<Wrek> 05creep and proud!
<otakon> ofc you are
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Wrek: i c wat u did thar
<Dken2021> and what good plot this show has...
<StinkomanFan> Yes RainbowcrashNBURN
<KernelCobb> It does say something about individuals, but it doesn't say anything about online communites...
<KernelCobb> owning the moon i mean
<StinkomanFan> Neil Armstrong met Luna, True fact
<Jim> inb4bronies take over the moon
<KernelCobb> BronyCon on the moon
<Jim> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/56e4bfaed220d20265a46e1ddbe0c86c/18856%20-%20AEIOU%20artist%3Amiketheuser%20astronaut%20luna%20moon.png
<KernelCobb> this must happen
<RAWRity> No nation can own the moon? Tell that to Newt Gingrich
<StinkomanFan> Photographic proof Jim
<KernelCobb> seems legit, jim
<KernelCobb> so what are we watching on the stream right now? i've been lost for a while
<StinkomanFan> Of course NASA editted her out of the photos and videos
<Jim> it's the "nothing's on" stream
<StinkomanFan> The world was not ready
<RainbowcrashNBurn> StinkomanFan: unless they never went to the moon :O
<StinkomanFan> MYTHBUSTERS DID IT
<StinkomanFan> Yes they did
<BronyCon> daaaaw
<StinkomanFan> So, Celestia must be hiding on the Sun

<TopHat> thats what the muffin's for
<Tovler> Way to keep Rayman relevant.
<Hazard3> hahaha Jim that link is awesome
<KernelCobb> and THEN you blow up
<Morty|Writing> saw ponies and tentacles, was nervous
<StinkomanFan> Doctor Whoof seems to like Bikini Bottom

<Hazard3> less
<Morty|Writing> discuss
<StinkomanFan> Doctor Whoof should poni poni
<Hazard3> i do NOT clop to ponies
<Jim> I personaly don't like r34
<MirrorImage> RainbowcrashNBurn - unfortunately, i think last episode was all the more reference he was going to get
<StinkomanFan> I see it that it makes you too much of a brony
<Rain> It neither makes you more or less of a brony if you clop to ponies, seeing as there are atleast two sides to every fandom
<Morty|Writing> guy on a youtube comment said he has a deeper connection than i do cause he clops
<KernelCobb> rule #34
<Hazard3> Clopping is the dark side
<RainbowcrashNBurn> MirrorImage: probably, but its worth hoping for
<KernelCobb> hazard3 agreed
<StinkomanFan> Come to the Dark Side
<StinkomanFan> we have ponies
<RAWRity> Morty|Writing: depends on which definition of "deep" he's using there...
<Hazard3> Anikan came to the dark side
<KernelCobb> *they have furries
<Morty|Writing> lol rawrity
<Hazard3> he was killed for it
<StinkomanFan> Molestia has TONS of
<Jim> Evil beware, we've got waffles
<StinkomanFan> nvrmind

<RAWRity> I just had a bizarre pop into my head.
<KernelCobb> it scares me
<Hazard3> what is this Rayman:Origins?
<StinkomanFan> Is it wrong that I miss the Rabbids?
<Morty|Writing> i just looked at r34, and was thoroughly disgusted
<String_Shredder> who's KernelCobb?
<KernelCobb> i loved raving rabbids
<Hazard3> yes morty
<KernelCobb> I'm kernelcobb
<MahBoi777> wassup

<String_Shredder> new guy...
<Morty|Writing> whats with the super fat fetish 6_9
<Hazard3> that is where Pedobear rules...
<RAWRity> It's for a Web Comic called "The Adventures of the Rapeior" in which a sentient, levitating sword goes around raping things you generally don't see get raped.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> im still waiting for rayman 4

<Hazard3> i think it would be fun
<KernelCobb> sounds like internet to me rawrity
<Morty|Writing> glad to hear it
<MahBoi777> hai Jim

<MahBoi777> LOL
<Hazard3> hahaha !
<KernelCobb> :)
<StinkomanFan> chug chug chug!
<MahBoi777> so true
<Hazard3> its funny because its TRUE
<MahBoi777> HOHO
<Quilava> also they made reshiram look kinda meh
<Hazard3> yo ho ho and a bottle of sasparilla
<StinkomanFan> Like that Episode of South Park with "Proper Condom Use"
<Lucario> i know what makes a scary combo
<Hazard3> lol
<DeadlyDerp3> :p
<KernelCobb> always drink sasparilla
<Hazard3> there is a texture pack on COD right now
<MahBoi777> hai DeadlyDerp3
<Dken2021> wha is it with people at concerts and recording with phones? especially if their megapixels are crap
<RainbowcrashNBurn> in this weeks ep, im going to be looking out for brony references rather than just derpy coz last weeks was filled with quite a few
<Lucario> http://pokebeach.com/scans/next-destinies/98-mewtwo-ex.jpg
<DeadlyDerp3> I need somepony to give me a hug :( Got all nervous from my desktop busting down
<StinkomanFan> Build MASS with SASS
<Lucario> http://pokebeach.com/scans/next-destinies/57-gardevoir.jpg
<RAWRity> I give not a single fuck about what message a musician promotes if the music is good. But Perry has some undefinable anti-talent that makes everything connected to her suck.
<Hazard3> deadlyderp i think u need to go read something funny
<DeadlyDerp3> Now worried that my laptop will bust down too
<StinkomanFan> Doctor Whooves was in last weeks episode
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> evening phillies
<Hazard3> hahaha RAWRity thats very very true
<Quilava> they all seem to have attacks that hurt themselves
<KernelCobb> he spun an hour glass
<MahBoi777> the cake is a lie, lol
<Dken2021> ...yea, really didn't enjoy that queen cover
<MahBoi777> evenin
<Wrek> 05http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/google-privacy-policy.png
<Lucario> that's nintendo's way of trying to justify the cards being "fair"
<StinkomanFan> Not like the one in Harry Potter though :c
<DeadlyDerp3> :P
<Hazard3> it would sortof ruin COD for me if someone even put a song into their microphone and would give me yet another very good reason to hate her
<DeadlyDerp3> :[
<MahBoi777> derpaderp
<DeadlyDerp3> Yay, got it
<Hazard3> several actually
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> they playing CoD on 360 or PS3?
<KernelCobb> dat #7 lol

<StinkomanFan> Lol number four
<Hazard3> 7 lolwut
<Lucario> like zekrom you just play it with a bunch of eels
<MahBoi777> nah, it's a recording I think, like an autopilot, but I think that's CoD for the Wii
<MahBoi777> 25
<Quilava> and reshiram can use your re-flip guy
<Hazard3> lol 2 is hilarious
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> wii? you sure? controls look too smooth to me for it to be wii O.o

<MahBoi777> I think it is the wii because of the graphics yea xP
<KernelCobb> What would the world be like if EVERYTHING was pony?
<StinkomanFan> Think of it, Equestria Daily: As far as the eye could see
<EspyLacopa> Ooo, The Mask is on ABC Family
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> they should do a stream of DMC4
<Quilava> oh hey, heals
<KernelCobb> The Mask is now pony
<MahBoi777> KernelCobb: everything you touvh now becomes a pony
<Lucario> it's more for it's power
<MahBoi777> *touch
<EspyLacopa> Hack the FBI and add ponies?
<Quilava> I know
*KernelCobb hugs self
<Quilava> but heals are good too
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> or better yet, when the HD pack comes out they should have a week long DMC marathon
<StinkomanFan> What would happen if The Mask and Pinkie Pie teamed up? :s
<KernelCobb> :)
<Phase4> and i;m bacj

<KernelCobb> i would read it
<StinkomanFan> Desmund the moon bear
<MahBoi777> StinkomanFan: here, I shall give the first word "the"
<Cypresswolf> well, Appleloosa is out in the desert. Think about any western you've seen, its hot during the day, clothes help keep the heat off.
<KernelCobb> the sand may also harm skin during windy days
<Tovler> Or I could make it so that some ponies ate the Apple from the book of Genesis.
<StinkomanFan> a naked Braeburn
*StinkomanFan nosebleed
<MahBoi777> O_o
<Rain> clothes help to both keep off heat and keep in cool
<unfoundbug> so. who else is watchin ep one now lol
<MahBoi777> lol
<StinkomanFan> Suddenly I want more of Braeburn...
<Rain> I <3 Braeburn
<Cypresswolf> clothes vary depending on terain and surround environment in that regard.
<KernelCobb> Uncle Apple Stroodle is best pony

<[WERK]Yahooz> ohai RAWRity!
<MahBoi777> AAAAAAAAAPPULOOSA
<Cypresswolf> Do ponies give wet willies too? I want to see a clip where somepony (preferrably Rarity by her dad) recieves a wet willie in jest :)
<StinkomanFan> And I forgot where that analogy was going
<KernelCobb> pony wet willy would hurt like hell i asume
<StinkomanFan> The CMC should become Bullies for one episode
<StinkomanFan> Many lols would be had
<MahBoi777> Cypressswolf: I think that'd be called a wet hoof
<Tovler> For some reason, I like the Flim Flam Brothers more than Braeburn
<Cypresswolf> ^Yay Verily!
<Rain> But who needs love? Not me! Who needs friends? I certianly do! Who needs drugs? Not me! Who needs sex? Nah, thats boring.
<MahBoi777> ^
<KernelCobb> MahBoi777 that might be taken into the wrong context
<StinkomanFan> Rarity's plenty wet already
<MahBoi777> true
<StinkomanFan> ...wait
<Rain> lol
<Tovler> I think its because they're tall. I like my colts tall.

<Randomnerd> ^
<KernelCobb> [that sound that emits from your chair that sounds like a fart] best name
<unfoundbug> step 2 give this world leader more power
<Randomnerd> I'm usually lookingfor a world leader that would look good in a hat, so we can make hats come back into style.
<Tovler> Ovaria would be a nice name.
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: done. http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-economy-in-the-toilet-watch-ponies.jpg

<BronyCon> Can someone put in a good video to stream?
<MahBoi777> if Chuck Norris was a brony, we wouldn't need a world leader

<emangamer> RAWRity: So I have permission to emulate your voice... or somepony else do it?
<Randomnerd> Well, he rides horses.

<StinkomanFan> I wish I had Bronies in my School
<Ingwaz> i do have at least 1 other brony in one of my college classes, i think possible 3 others actually though
<StinkomanFan> My mother laughed in my face when I told her I was a Brony :'(
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03As far as I know, only 3 people in my college are bronies :(
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Cypresswolf: you have just found me something to do, i thank you
<Ingwaz> MLP was brought up today in class and a guy said dont hate on bronies, so i'm betting hes in there with us
<Randomnerd> Who needs real friends! You've got the Intenet lol
<Shizuka> 13trololo?
<Ingwaz> and Scoot-Scootaloo, you might be surprised how many colleges students are bronies, we easily make up the biggest group
<Randomnerd> That's pretty harsh, StinkomanFan :(
<StinkomanFan> It is
<RAWRity> you know what's fun to do in Pokemon Black/White wireless battles?

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I am an open Brony! I make it obvious that I am one!
<Randomnerd> Well, it could have been worse, you could have been sent to the shrink...
<MirrorImage> Ingwaz - it completely depends on the college, of course
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yet only 3 know about it :(
<StinkomanFan> I sent MYSELF to the Shrink afterwards
<MirrorImage> Robert Morris University has someone *trying* to get a group together, though at last check, he's got all of 8 people (in a school of about 4000+)
<Ingwaz> i just got some buttons to decorate my messenger back with, i'm not the type to go up and shout it at people or anything, figure that will act more like a calling card
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i would be more open of being a brony in college, if there wasnt strong vibes against them as a whole in my class :(
<Cypresswolf> Dem sparkles! Alex Louis Armstrong is the ONLY man allowed to Sparkle! 6_9
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i only know of 1 other brony in my class, possible 2 coz of references he makes
<Ingwaz> and MirrorImage, of course it depends on the college, but even with that, college students make up the biggest group of bronies
<StinkomanFan> The way I came out as a Brony was them Pocket Ponies
<Randomnerd> Hm... I'll save this honey bun for tomorrow.
<StinkomanFan> You put a paper poni in your pocket
<Dken2021> I probably would've met some bronies in the anime club, but I don't go to that university anymore
<Ingwaz> i've considered starting a brony group, but i dont really know what we would do...
*Randomnerd is now just embarassed, doesn't feel like a fat bastard.
<Randomnerd> Well, the NYC area Bronies have it easy
<StinkomanFan> And when people try to mock you for being a brony call them out on there sexuality
<Cypresswolf> Im 20 minutes in :)
<Randomnerd> We've got a pre-existing group.
<StinkomanFan> Worked for me
<Phase4> RAWRity: now thats how you play pokemon
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NYC bronies have it easy?
<Dken2021> omg, aron is the new fear, only more deadly
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I doubt it...
<Randomnerd> I mean that Meet-ups are possible.
<Ingwaz> nah StinkomanFan, i'm secure in my sexuality, and i could probably pretty easily argue the case for MLP
*Tovler prays to Based Aron
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh yeah! I would like to Meetup with people there!
<RainbowcrashNBurn> how is this for mindfuck: person in my class who is openly gay, is the most opposed to ponies/bronies
<Cypresswolf> And there's a 10 hour version when this one is done *psycho Twilight smile*
<StinkomanFan> Inb4 a CSI:NY episode about Bronies
<Randomnerd> BronyCon has a meet-up page and it's easy to get together that way.
<Dken2021> ponies =/= homosexual activity
<Ingwaz> majority of bronies are heterosexual
<Ingwaz> something like 80% i believe
<Tovler> I still need to see the CSI episode on furries.
<Randomnerd> StinkomanFan: Ugh... good point. There's been eps about "Pony Play" and LARPers.
<Randomnerd> Or was that Bones?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I have tried to go to one of the Meetups, but with Campus rules, I'm pretty much limited :/
<Ingwaz> ? campus rules?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i just wish there were at least some meetups in uk
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yeah, my campus has a policy where you can only go so far...
<Randomnerd> Scoot-Scootaloo: I take it you're still in High School?
<StinkomanFan> I was saying that you accuse the people who are mocking you of being Homosexual

<RainbowcrashNBurn> and open about it
*Randomnerd went to a party school, just doesn't understand :(
<StinkomanFan> Accuse them of hiding behind an Imaginary boyfreind
<emangamer> LordCelestia: but you our pony overlord...you should be at least 3/4ths
<Randomnerd> StinkomanFan: Bother their sexuality! People who hate ponies are just full of themselves.
<Dken2021> ohai LordCelestia

<pony_935728> hello?
<Ingwaz> and StinkomanFan, i gathered that, but, if you dont do that and instead appeal to their intelligence, i'm betting you're more likely to get them to listen
<Dken2021> heyo otakon
<ScootaChicken|work> that's it
<Randomnerd> Just SuperBrony64 's magical stream of repeas
<ScootaChicken|work> Geography homework

<otakon> not much SSv2
<ScootaChicken|work> I can't do it anymore
<ScootaChicken|work> I can't.
<Ingwaz> also, Scoot-Scootaloo, you could always do a campus brony group
<ScootaChicken|work> Jamaica's Tourist Industry, I really don't care about you
<ScootaChicken|work> and I don't care about you nearly enough to want to write two pages on you
<StinkomanFan> Trying to convince someone that they are intellegent without you having a hidden motive is harder for me
<StinkomanFan> 5 years of arguements can do that
<ScootaChicken|work> oh god my teacher's gonna kill me
*ScootaChicken|work smashes head on keyboard

<ScootaChicken|work> and its due in in 8 hours ;___;

<StinkomanFan> That's harder for me because Despite having 2 other bronies in class one of them is a HUGE ASS
<emangamer> RAWRity: WAAAAT...thats legit
<Randomnerd> That, RAWRity, is very nice :D
<Tovler> Randomnerd: ^This
<Tovler> pony paper lanterns
<Cypresswolf> Amen to that, Randomnerd
<StinkomanFan> Nopony likes him and even knowing he exists hurts me
<Phase4> knowing who exists?
<emangamer> StinkomanFan: that's a rather cruel thing to say
<Randomnerd> Though, to be honest, I'm a pretty hard drinker, as well ;)
<RainbowcrashNBurn> this is too true :S http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/8550f94c-8ecc-407f-a23a-87f5d2c70266.png

<Tovler> I don't club hard though
<StinkomanFan> Especially when you yourself have a mental handicap
<emangamer> RainbowcrashNBurn: as much as I wish that was true, most of those things have people KILLED because of it.
<Cypresswolf> I drink every day if something is available, but don't plan on going anywhere afterwards. Helps to have a bar within walking distance
<emangamer> hey Scoot-Scootaloo wub <3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sup emangamer <3
<Randomnerd> Cypresswolf: My bar is a hutch in my desk :D
<otakon> Cypresswolf: that sounds like a problem
<Tovler> bar hopping with bronies would be interesting
<MahBoi777> stay thirsty my friends

<Cypresswolf> Its no problem at all. Its currently closed for fire code voilations, but when it is open, Im only down there every couple of weeks.
<StinkomanFan> Go downstairs and watch ponies to get over your hangover
<MahBoi777> ^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Wjo's going to Bronycon? I know I am!
<Cypresswolf> *once every couple of weeks* They have good steaks, but a bit high priced
<Randomnerd> Friends of Mine are in a group for Steampunk's World's Fair in NJ
<Randomnerd> We're doing pony-inspired costumes, and I'll be wearing mine to BronyCon after that.
<MahBoi777> probably a stupid question, but what is steampunk?
<LadyCanary> I want to go ;^;
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i wish i could go, the special guests line up are awesome
<RAWRity> so, you guys know that abomination that is "Jersey Shore"?
<Dken2021> yup
<RAWRity> and you know Snooki?
<StinkomanFan> It's ending
<Cypresswolf> I've been saving up to put in my own bar at home, got a nice collection of custom pony glasses, and a little stock pile of my favorite drinks. Just need the furniture and a remodel
*Tovler puts steampunk on the list of stuff white people like.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03If its anything better than January's Bronycon, this will be the best one EVER
<RainbowcrashNBurn> RAWRity: ive heard of it, fortunately never seen it

<IngloriousPony89> To long; Didnt read
<Phase4> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figs_in_the_Bible :D:D:D:D
<ScootaChicken|work> ohai Athena
<ScootaChicken|work> so you're new here?
<Randomnerd> Oh, the curse on the tree?
<Athena> Yes and no
<Yahooz> TL;DR: The international troll pledge of allegance
<Randomnerd> Yeah. I just saw the Bunnies burning the fig newtons.
<MahBoi777> Figs are evil
<Phase4> RAWRity: yup http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:14&version=NIV
<Randomnerd> Yeah, that's in the bible -folks whip that one out for guilt by association.
<MahBoi777> *eats fig newton*
*LadyCanary 's grandfather has a fig tree in his backyard :3
<Phase4> the bible says to not eat figs
*IngloriousPony89 loves fig newtons
<RAWRity> if this is true, internet geeks are effetively immortal: http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lysmniRHS41qkvbwso1_r1_500.png
<StinkomanFan> Are Ponies in the Bible?
<Randomnerd> ie: The Bible is full of Horrible and Crazy things, therefore everything in it is Horrible and Crazy.
<StinkomanFan> I thought so
<Randomnerd> Horses are in the bible, yes.
<MahBoi777> IngloriousPony89: ikr?
*Athena reads the bible
<Dken2021> most of the things in the old testament are crazy sounding today
<StinkomanFan> Then Ponies are kosher!
<LadyCanary> Oi!
<Dken2021> yet people still use it to slur the gays
<Randomnerd> The Bible works a lot better when it's not treated as a text book.
*ScootaChicken|work reads the Qu'ran
<MahBoi777> oi oi oi
<IngloriousPony89> ikr MahBoi777?
<Phase4> the in context 'dont eat figs' thing makes less sense than 'figs are evil'
<Athena> What Randomnerd said
<Athena> And then the chat went to sleep
<MahBoi777> Phase4: if figs are evil, I'm goin to hell TT__TT

<DJMidgetBrony> Neeed to get my setlist done for DJing tommorow
<IngloriousPony89> Bai Scoot
<StinkomanFan> Bye Chicken
<MahBoi777> bai Scoot-Scootaloo
<MahBoi777> and then there were two
<RAWRity> But let's say, for argument's sake, that Studio B and hasbro HAD intended for Derpy to be mentally challenged: WHY WOULD THAT BE A BAD THING? Why would having a mentally challenged character be offensive? SHould children be sheilded from the fact that mental retardation exists?
<LadyCanary> ...Daaaaaaang.
<ScootaChicken> Daaaaaayum.
<StinkomanFan> I say we take it to OBAMA
<prince-dari> You going to slip a pony song into your setlist? :P
<IngloriousPony89> in the eyes of most parents thes days RAWRity, yes.
<DJMidgetBrony> tl;ra
<Tovler> RAWRity: Rainbow told Derpy to just sit there, which could be seen as ableist.
<StinkomanFan> :|
<DJMidgetBrony> Not the point really
<RAWRity> IngloriousPony89: well then those parents can fuck right off. Acting like mental retardation doesn't exist is much, much more harmful.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01waves and explodes
<DJMidgetBrony> It shouldn't really offend people
<Yahooz> ohai Nittany_Discord
<MahBoi777> people get mad over the stupidest things
<Tovler> Also, Derpy seemed unaware that she caused all that damage.
*IngloriousPony89 waves back at Nittany parts
<Athena> Oh wonderful
*Athena cleans up Nittany_Discord mess
<Tovler> aside from that small oops my bad
<Athena> Nittany_Discord's*
<StinkomanFan> "Doctor Whooves implies that Time Travelers are cowardly horses!"
<Dken2021> oh they're changing derpy's name?
<IngloriousPony89> Maybe she didn't give a single fuck
<RAWRity> Tovler: no, she was aware of it. SHe apologized, AND acknowledged that she's acidentally caused it.
<LadyCanary> Nittany_Discord!
<MahBoi777> Gummy logic
<RAWRity> Dken2021: no official word on that.
<RAWRity> just rumors piled on top of rumors.
<StinkomanFan> Yo dog we heard you like rumors
<LadyCanary> Rumor sandvich
<MahBoi777> ^
<Yahooz> Tasty rumors?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is this argument over the parents and fans getting angry over Derpy?
<Athena> Mmm Sandvich
<Tovler> And what was with that thundercloud anyway?
<LadyCanary> Delicious rumors.
<MahBoi777> rumorception
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think Derpy's staying.
<Athena> Rumors in layers?
<MahBoi777> tastes like bacon
<StinkomanFan> "You were almost a JILL SANDWICH"-Jerk nopony likes
<Tovler> If I was king Solomon, I would chop Derpy in half and replace her with Screwball.
<StinkomanFan> King Soloman is Celestia's dad
<MahBoi777> Tovler: No, not derpy
<StinkomanFan> Trufax
<IngloriousPony89> Ok, it's suppertime for me. Might be on later, depending on how strong my Dark Souls addition is. Later everypony <3
*Tovler gets slapped with a King Salmon
<Athena> toodles IngloriousPony89
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01King Solomon never chopped anyone in half.
<StinkomanFan> He wanted to
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<Yahooz> No it was a test of faifth
<Yahooz> *faith
<MahBoi777> later IngloriousPony89
<StinkomanFan> Who said he didn't cover his tracks with that?
<Yahooz> it was to see who cared for it more
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He had someone attempt to chop a baby in half when two women were arguing over it.
*DJMidgetBrony turns on his ps3 for a dr who marathon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the true mother came forth in the end.
<Tovler> Yahooz: I think you're confusing Solomon with Abraham and Isaac
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/zhe3D.jpg
<Athena> Isn't that from the bible?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<StinkomanFan> The Binding Of Isaac
<StinkomanFan> Spoilers: Issac get attacked
<Yahooz> No King Solomon proposed that they chop it in half, and one person cared too much to let that happen. Solomon then let that person have the whole thing
<StinkomanFan> Isaac ends up just fine though
<Tovler> I'm all for a name change only because Derpy is a painfully uncreative name.
<Shizuka> 13nevar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm all for leaving Derpy alone.
<StinkomanFan> And Yahooz stop being a buzzkill or I'll chop YOU in half
<ScootaChicken> hey prince-dari, I have something to show you: http://www.mobiletoones.com/downloads/wallpapers/love_wallpapers/preview/25/33621-i-m-sorry.gif
<prince-dari> Well that's like saying change any of the pony names because they are painfully uncreative.
<prince-dari> Most of them are pretty simple.
<prince-dari> But that's how we know them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I liked "Ditzy Doo" more, but I respect their use of "Derpy."
<prince-dari> So we don't want them to change.
<ScootaChicken> surprised Twilight Sparkle passed legal.
<Yahooz> StinkomanFan: ;____;
<StinkomanFan> Lyra becomes Heartstrings
<Tovler> The only other lazy I can think of is Lyra, which isn't very lazy.
<MahBoi777> Lyra is best human
<prince-dari> Ahahaha ScootaChicken, you'd have to try a lot harder than that to seriously offend me. :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If the show creators changed things on the whim of fans, we might have G3. (remember who's supposed to watch MLP).
<ScootaChicken> I just realised that all of the mane six plus a couple of others all have their own wikipedia pages
<StinkomanFan> Cry some more and it'll be from bottom up!
*DJMidgetBrony opens a bottle of Sweet Apple Acres Hard Cider
<Tovler> I didn't even know actual disabled people got ragged on. Who does that?
<ScootaChicken> I approve.
<ScootaChicken> Does anyone remember back when every single Pokemon had a wikipedia page?

<Athena> I never really got why lyra was a human
<Yahooz> emantrollslayer: no, talking about the 11th doctor would though
<StinkomanFan> Now only Mewtwo is that awesome
<emantrollslayer> prince-dari: I know.....but still
<prince-dari> There's nothing to forgive. :>
<Tovler> Lyra sitting like a human and the fandom exploded
*PartyCannon slaps prince-dari for posting spoilers

<Mortys_Mortician> i actually cant wait for Walle times
<fillyfillyy> and g'night to all you
<Randomnerd> Physical books.
<Randomnerd> Though there's something to be said for a portable library.
<Mortys_Mortician> ok why is Cod always on?
<Tovler> die, physical books, die
<SuperBrony64> 10,02night fillyfillyy!
<Mortys_Mortician> i know its a default replayable video, but why?
<Randomnerd> Tovler: Why? D:
<Dken2021|FF1> I could do with either or, but I like that feeling of turning the page
*Randomnerd takes everyone's unwanted books
<Mortys_Mortician> fight harder=/=ponies
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai everypony :3
<Mortys_Mortician> hai Superbrony64
<Dken2021|FF1> lali-ho SuperBrony64
<Mortys_Mortician> u silly filly
<Randomnerd> I've been listening to audiobooks lately, while doing other things.
<otakon> hi SuperBrony64!
<Cypresswolf> Half my family has a nook of their own, but Ive always like books I can hold and flip through.
<Randomnerd> Hi, SuperBrony64
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: sorta depends. I personally prefer physical books, but digital books are more affordable.
<LadyCanary> SuperBrony64! :3 wub
<Phase4> ohai SuperBrony64
<Tovler> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Adansonia_grandidieri04.jpg because trees are awesome.
<Randomnerd> Well, easier to store.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02wub wub wub
<DJMidgetBrony> Sup SuperBrony64
<RAWRity> plus, I don't need to worry about tearing a page with a digital book.
<Phase4> dafaq is with that tree
<Mortys_Mortician> that tree
<Dken2021|FF1> look, it's rafiki's home
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm still stuck in class O___o
<Cypresswolf> :) I like listening to the complaining when the nook's battery runs out...while Im still reading my book
<Mortys_Mortician> is a weird penis
<RAWRity> Phase4: it has the stranged boner right now.
<Randomnerd> Don't try and charm me with that Fluttershy, Tovler!
<Tovler> gurl, that tree is nothing but trunk, hot damn <3
<Phase4> RAWRity: its realy happy to see me
<RAWRity> plus, digital books means less deforestation.
<Dken2021|FF1> What is it with RPGs and magic keys?
<Mortys_Mortician> deforestation means less mosquitos though right?
<Randomnerd> More electricity and expenditure of fuel for the e-reader.
<Mortys_Mortician> mosquitos are bitches
<Randomnerd> You gotta charge the thing.
<Phase4> Randomnerd: but burning one book would power a single nook for its entire lifetime
<Phase4> net gain
<Phase4> as long as you buy more than one book
<Randomnerd> Its lifetime?
<Tovler> yeah, a bookshelf makes a room smell nice, but that about it.
<Mortys_Mortician> burning one book would power a single christian for a year
<Mortys_Mortician> if it was harry potter
<Dken2021|FF1> Guy Montag would Disaprove with your silly E-readers
<Cypresswolf> I like old books that are hard to find. I found some poetry books by Grace Carol Noll a few years ago. That sensation of discovery is something you dont get downloading a book you can find in seconds. But thats just me.
<Phase4> ^
<Phase4> is true
<Randomnerd> Well, it wasn't the book's material, it was the fact that people didn't wnat their beliefs challenged.
<Randomnerd> want*
<Mortys_Mortician> @ mah harry potter joke Randomnerd?
<LordCelestia> 0,5DAEDRIC BOW LOOKS COOL
<Randomnerd> Fahrenheit 451.
<LadyCanary> I've read that
<LadyCanary> Not a bad read.
<Mortys_Mortician> LC is a funny filly
<RAWRity> i've only read the Farenheit 451 Graphic Novel.
<Randomnerd> It was about the dumbing down of society, many people believe it to be about Government censorship.
<Mortys_Mortician> if cod is tsill screaming imma kill my gerbil
<Mortys_Mortician> streaming*
<Tovler> Bah, I just called it Farenheit 911. Damn you Michael Moore
<Phase4> Mortys_Mortician: poor gerbil
<Mortys_Mortician> sorry subliminal message from my gerbil
<Cypresswolf> Expecially books in a series like Redwall. took me 5 years to collect the set. I'd buy 1 or 2 at a time, read them, then hunt for the next in the series
<Randomnerd> I read it every year for banned books week.
<Mortys_Mortician> ok whoever is streaming
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: There was a graphic novel of it?
<Mortys_Mortician> my gerbil es in le blender
<Randomnerd> Yup.
<SuperBored64> 10,02Dat LordCelestia
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: eeyup
<Randomnerd> LadyCanary: Yup.
<Dken2021|FF1> I had to do a report for a freshman course
<LadyCanary> Interesting. Is it any good, RAWRity?
*Randomnerd kills the stream and switches back on "Moby Dick"
<Dken2021|FF1> well, more like list stuff that happened, but really liked that book
<LordCelestia> 0,5Dat 64
<Mortys_Mortician> if only Randomnerd
<Cypresswolf> is this stream live or the loop that was on earlier?
<Mortys_Mortician> dose mods
<Honey_Whistle> Everypony, I now have 1 voice actor, 1 composer, and 1 artist for my project.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: I think so. Haven't read the novel, so I can't speak on its accuracy, but I enjoyed it.
<Phase4> is anyone here interested in a button to turn the stream off? i wrote one for me and might add it to the script
<Mortys_Mortician> yay honey whistle
<Mortys_Mortician> what project?
<Honey_Whistle> The script is being written.
<Phase4> Honey_Whistle: whats your project?
<Randomnerd> It's the pause button, why worry?
<Honey_Whistle> My PW/MLP project.
<Dken2021|FF1> Honey_Whistle good job, hope you get more to work with you
<Mortys_Mortician> PW?
<Tovler> SWEET! Black Rock Shooter just got subbed.
<Honey_Whistle> Phoenix Wright.
<MirrorImage> Randomnerd - that still ultimately takes up memory as opposed to removing the stream outright
<Mortys_Mortician> coo man coo
<Randomnerd> Fair enough -My laptop has no real power, so I never notice.
<Honey_Whistle> Still no reply from Seth.
<Mortys_Mortician> smack dat ass wario
<MirrorImage> you obviously haven't blue-screened your laptop then trying to play Minecraft and watch Youtube
<RAWRity> Also, Books everypony should check out: John Dies At The End, House of Leaves, Let The Right One In, Only Revolutions, Handling the Undead, The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror
<MirrorImage> simultaneously
<Honey_Whistle> If anypony wants to volunteer as a voice actor, please PM me.
<MirrorImage> for what honey?
<Phase4> Randomnerd: http://derpy.me/CexZX << this is before i wrote the button, was doing it manualy. its what i meen by turn the stream off
*Honey_Whistle points above.
<MirrorImage> as in Turnabout Storm or something unrelated to that?
<Randomnerd> Phase4: got it
<Honey_Whistle> It's not Turnabout Storm, it's my own project.
<RAWRity> f
<Tovler> (Dude, It's Groundhog Day, not Groundhog's Day)
<RAWRity> Tovler: that's an Awesome movie, btw
<MirrorImage> i've always pronounced it with the s...
<MirrorImage> and i live in Pennsylvania
<Tovler> (Also it's Daylight Saving Tine, not Daylight Savings Time)
<Randomnerd> Oh, Groundhog Day.
<Randomnerd> We're a magnificently strange bunch.
<Tovler> That should've been the A movie. Oh well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I went to Punxsutawney one year for Groundhog's Day.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, we should have streamed Groundhog's Day today.
<LadyCanary> :3
<LadyCanary> I like the sound of that.
<Midnight_Tempest> hai gaiz
<RAWRity> i totally want to write a movie called Daylight Saving Time now.
<Midnight_Tempest> dooo eeett
<otakon> it's not too late
<otakon> do we have a streamer and techie?
<Tovler> http://www.gocomics.com//nonsequitur/2012/02/02
<RAWRity> "One man who has to turn back the clock, in a fight against the darkness. Daniel Radcliffe stars in...DAYLIGHT SAVINGS"
<MirrorImage> we got plenty of techies floating around
<otakon> Ilike teh catch line RAWRity
<Tovler> DST: One man will travel through time.
<MirrorImage> "Only to discover... he's not alone."
<Tovler> Actually a lot of people will travel through time… like all of them.
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> evening
<MirrorImage> One man: "Dude... did the whole world just travel back in time?"
<Randomnerd> We can show it tomorrow before the stream :D
<Tovler> Except the ones in Arizona. and Hawaii.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hey
<MirrorImage> Another dude: "Yeah... I think we did..."
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> is
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> is that
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> RAYMAN?!
<Tovler> I think half of Indiana finally observes DST
<kirzstryfe> 1,3might be if the autopilot is running
<RAWRity> key quote from the trailer: "You know, it happens again and again...like clockwork. We fall back when really...we need to learn to spring forward."
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What should I play?
<Cypresswolf> Im off for the night. See ya'll tomorrow night
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> hmm. cool
<Shizuka> 13hey, any modellers in here? daz3d has Daz Studio 4 Pro, Bryce 7 Pro, and Hexagon 2.5 FREE FREE until the end of the month
<SkilledSkillet> Nacht Cypresswolf
<kirzstryfe> 1,3o.O
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> so hows everyone tonight?
<Shizuka> 13www.daz3d.com, only catch is you have to sign up for the newsletter, but you can let spam filters catch that
<PinkiePieCakeIsALie> or are you and i the only ones actually here?
<Shizuka> 13it's like a thousand dollars worth, FREE LEGIT FREE
<Tovler> inb4 Derpy's eyes are corrected
<LordCelestia> 0,5Modelers?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: I don't listen to offers from teh ded
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka is an adbot!
<MirrorImage> they won't correct them - at most, they'll fix her voice to a more Libman one and actually call her Ditzy
<SkilledSkillet> :O
<Shizuka> 13do it fillies, professional grade modeling software doesn't go free often
<Shizuka> 13or just download it and put it away :P
<Tovler> Oh wait. Was this the Shizuka that Shikuka warned us about?
<Dken2021|FF1> I don't even know how to use it, but will dl it anyway
<Phase4> ohai people, i'm distracted from my distractions
<RAWRity> honestly I doubt they'll do ANYTHING to her, other than issuing a small, vague "apology" to those stupid enough to take offense to it.
<Tovler> Behind offended doesn't entitle you to anything.
<MirrorImage> it's purely PR though
<MirrorImage> we have corrupted MLP - they don't want to let it get *too* corrupted
<Tovler> Scootachicken is fast.
<Tovler> inb4 Vinyl is named Vinyl and has red eyes.
<Phase4> ^
<MirrorImage> now that would be interesting to see
<emantrollslayer> GOOD NEWS EVERYPONY, you just read this in my voice
<MirrorImage> where did the red eyes even come from?
<Dken2021|FF1> emantrollslayer nice try
<Tovler> I'm an albino and I find Vinyl offensive
<MirrorImage> emantrollslayer - dude... you're Morgan Freeman?
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: I don't know what your voice sounds like sooooo
<Shizuka> hey do all the mods see this or just saturn and dift?
<Mortys_Mortician> anyone else watching the eqd stream?
<otakon> enope
<MirrorImage> nope - i'm playing Slots at the Sierra Madre
<otakon> I should be though
<otakon> I'm on Skype
<otakon> but the convo is kind of dead atm
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont use skype... gotta pay for it right?
<MirrorImage> i don't think so
<Tovler> Seth's OC still looks like a Flim Flam brother.
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: only for premium edition
<Midnight_Tempest> i see
<Tovler> I might watch it. I'm sure the Derpy thing will come up.
<otakon> well
<MirrorImage> i think it's just MictheMicrophone and his Dramatic Reading month
<otakon> they are basically redacting Derpy
<otakon> because people were offended by her name
<Midnight_Tempest> fuck that... best name ever imo
<otakon> argh
<MirrorImage> the voice was the only problem i had with that scene
<MirrorImage> and even that was a minor gripe
<RAWRity> again, there's no solid evidence that they are redacting Derpy yet.
<Tovler> Who are these shadow bronies who are attacking Derpy?
<RAWRity> rumors on top of rumors on top of rumors. that's all we have atm.
<Phase4> the're actualy offended by a pony's name?
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - it's the internet
<RAWRity> Tovler: idiots who think "Derpy" is a slur against the mentally challenged.
<MirrorImage> i wouldn't be surprised if 4chan is behind most of those "offended" people
<Phase4> thats more silly than people tend to be, then again MirrorImage is right
<Midnight_Tempest> they could easily modify the voice to be more feminine, done... its not like calling her Ditzy is any less offensive to people...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01test
<MirrorImage> RAWRity - ... one sec
<Tovler> I just wanna know why we're deciding that Derpy is a slur?
<Skitsmore> I dun wanna see Derpy gone :'c
<Tovler> Is it being used by every 4th grade asshole ever? Just asking.
<RAWRity> Tovler: because some people take innocuous words way too seriously.
<Midnight_Tempest> the only people that complained are people that have family memebers that are mentally handicapped...
<Midnight_Tempest> its a freaking cartoon... just let it go people...
<RAWRity> I've seen people say that using the word crazy in any way is somehow ofensive to those with mental illnesses
<Tovler> Maybe screaming DURRRRRP is offensive?
<MirrorImage> http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/01/27/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-super-funny-title/
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity: then thats offensive to any person that isnt considered normal by you, or me, or the guy next door... its just silly
<otakon> well no use in raging over it
<Tovler> seriously, who are these shadow bronies? I guess they aren't from 4chan.
<otakon> she is no longer Derpy canonically
<RAWRity> I have literally NEVER heard anybody ever try to insult a mentally challenged person by saying they're "derpy"
<Mortys_Mortician> how do people open skype chats with multiple people?
<otakon> they'll probably edit the video
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope this Derpy uproar doesn't scare Studio B, Hasbro, or whatnot into not doing something like Derpy again. Even worse, I hope they don't remove Derpy.
<MirrorImage> and i quote - "Since when did Derps make fun of mental disabilities? It's a name for funny faces people make using crossed eyes."
<otakon> make it ditzy
<KetaminaDianePie> O.O
<otakon> Mortys_Mortician: you have to make a group
<KetaminaDianePie> wut?
<Tovler> She's still called Derpy on Hubworld.com
<Phase4> dat you must be new here XD
<Mortys_Mortician> idk how to do that >:0
<RAWRity> i've got the EQD stream playing right now.
<MirrorImage> what are they talking about?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EqD stuff. :p
<RAWRity> somepony just said "Wehn, in the last 100 years, have musicians been good role models? pffffft"
<Mortys_Mortician> they are being kind aobnoxious
<Tovler> This EQD stream is putting me to sleep.
<MirrorImage> aren't they always?
<Tovler> durr hurr inception
<Tovler> a slight nod to crookedtrees
<otakon> someone pm me the EqD stream please?
<MirrorImage> otakon - it's on the front page of EQD

<Mortys_Mortician> OH
<RAWRity> but in all seriousness I have never- ABSOLUTELY NEVER- seen anypony use the term "Derpy" to mock the mentally challenged in any way. Even those who did portray her as somewhat mentally disabled, it was never to mock or insult, if anything it was supportive of the mentally challenged.
<Mortys_Mortician> ^
<MahBoi777> hai BEN
<Mortys_Mortician> my supportive arrow asserts that I am equally clever
<Randomnerd> ^
<Randomnerd> As does mine!
<Mortys_Mortician> you can't do that we're in a duel

<pony_4584> allo?
<Tovler> It's funny. The dictionary definition of retard is far kinder than the one for disabled, yet retarded is the big bad word.

<Midnight_Tempest> hey Nittany_Discord, can I add you on steam?
<MahBoi777> ScootaChicken: they're mesmerizing
<Phase4> well i'm going back onthe roof again
<Phase4> brb
<Tovler> yeah, we still need to know who spearheading this campaign.
<RAWRity> right now they'd just be discussing rumors and misinformation
<MahBoi777> Phase4: good luck
<ScootaChicken> oh god I'm so sleepy ;_______;

<Tovler> His name was in all caps anyway
<RAWRity> Tovler: we've already killed him to stop his offensiveness
<BEN> ScootaChicken: as I am now alive as well, I must urge you to go to sleep!
<SkilledSkillet> May I as well Nittany_Discord?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sure.
<ScootaChicken> sleep is difficult when you're coughing violently every five seconds
<ScootaChicken> oh god
<ScootaChicken> its BEN
<ScootaChicken> what have you done BronyState...
<BEN> ScootaChicken: No worries, I am a living being now!
<GabeMoist> no you're not
<RAWRity> also, Tovler, you need to hange your name beause it sounds too close to "tardy". They also need to change that line in Lesson Zero now.
<MahBoi777> ScootaChicken: sleep is for the weak, not that I'm implying anything
<BEN> GabeMoist: Olga Orly?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anywho, lemme see what I have.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: nO! you must sleep!
<otakon> take some medicine!
<Tovler> hm, Twilight did get a little tardy in that episode.
<ScootaChicken> I think I might just go listen to some Creedence Clearwater Revival and try to conk off to sleep...
<RAWRity> also, somebody gifted MictheMicrophone Steam on Steam
<ScootaChicken> that usually helps
<LadyCanary> ScootaChicken....YES YES YES YES
<ScootaChicken> ohai LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> I've been here ^^"
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: don't forget to check out that Johnny Hobo album.
<Midnight_Tempest> wow... Nittany has alot of games on steam, and i got a few of them too :)
<BEN> ScootaChicken: try not to think of the things that can kill you in your sleep!
<Tovler> tardy and retarded have the same latin root word, or something like that.
<ScootaChicken> hey LadyCanary, have you heard there cover of Heard it Through the Grapevine?
<LadyCanary> And I loves me some Creedence Clearwater Revival
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've played a fraction of them.
<ScootaChicken> I sure will RAWRity
<LadyCanary> Well of course!
<Cypresswolf> no sleep for me after all -_-
<Midnight_Tempest> wow, other people listen to CCR... thats awesome
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CCR rules.
<Midnight_Tempest> agreed
<FoxFerret>   ▲
<MahBoi777> ain't no rest for the wicked
<ScootaChicken> lots of people here like CCR
<FoxFerret> no
<Cypresswolf> no indeed
<RAWRity> Tovler: mostly because "retard" literally just means "to slow" and is A VERB.
<FoxFerret>   ▲
<BEN> O...M...G... I have EYES!
<ScootaChicken> fine, quite a few people here like CCR
<FoxFerret> rofl
<MirrorImage> lets not have this debate kthx
<FoxFerret>   ▲
<Cypresswolf> trying to reinstall fallout new vegas. taking too long
<FoxFerret> ▲ ▲
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<MahBoi777> BEN: how many??
<ScootaChicken> hey LadyCanary, you like Iron Maiden?
<LadyCanary> ....
<LadyCanary> Yes <3
<RAWRity> as in "This canyon will certainly prove to retard our journey"
<BEN> MahBoi777: TWO! Two FUll and REAL EYES!
<FoxFerret>   ▲
<LadyCanary> Iron Maiden? EXCELLENT! *guitar solo*
<MahBoi777> BEN: NO WAI
<ScootaChicken> : D
<MahBoi777> Triforce!
<Tovler> yep, and gay used to be a double entendre
<ScootaChicken> I saw Iron Maiden in August last year : D
<ScootaChicken> it was awesome
<LadyCanary> ...Lucky ;^;
<BEN> Now all I need is a living title, as to not frighten the who dont know my true story
<Mortys_Mortician> pina colada
<Tovler> word evolvution just isn't evolution.
<ScootaChicken> but they didn't play Run to the Hills ;___;
<Mortys_Mortician> s are good
<SkilledSkillet> Awww
<LadyCanary> Did they play Fear of the Dark?
<ScootaChicken> yeah
<MirrorImage> ...lol, 10,689 pre-war money in Fallout New Vegas
<MahBoi777> lol
*LadyCanary has a constant fear that someones always near
<LadyCanary> ;3
<MirrorImage> now i just need to find a store with 100k+ caps to convert that back into... Caps
<MahBoi777> lurking in the shadows
<RAWRity> meh, Iron Maiden can make some good music, but they never like to leave the tiny box they've made for themselves.
<otakon> welp
<otakon> that's a LOT of chaos on that stream
<otakon> alot!
*BEN just remembered who CCR was and cannot believe he forgot!
<MahBoi777> so much chaos
<Tovler> I've never knowingly heard Iron Maiden
<ScootaChicken> LadyCanary, do you like their new(ish) album?
<Cypresswolf> freakin love steam right now ^_^ a month and a half ago, my computer crashed and I lost everything that wasnt backed up. found my old steam name and it has all the game info and is re loading it
<LadyCanary> I havent heard their new stuff lately.
<Midnight_Tempest> we need more Chaos... release the warp daemons!!
<ScootaChicken> their latest album is actually pretty good
<MahBoi777> explosive chocolate milk
<ScootaChicken> which surprised me given how much I dislike most of their stuff after Fear of the Dark
<RAWRity> The Final Frontier is the same sound as their last 3 so, if you liked those, you'll like it.
<ScootaChicken> I never really listened to their last three...
<ScootaChicken> I bought Final Frontier and hoped it would be good and was pleasantly surprised
<BEN> So who here likes Parov Stelar?
<Flaria> BEN: Catgroove. /)
<Cypresswolf> If ya'll happen to hear some terrified or angry hollering, that'll be me. Either Im on the war path or found a hive of ghouls or something :)
<Randomnerd> Augh... Constitution! Y U NO UNAMBIGUOUS?!
<BEN> Flaria: (\
<MahBoi777> Cypresswolf: I shall ready the earmuffs
<herpaderp> Cypresswolf: And if you encounter a hive of butterflies?
<Midnight_Tempest> im cheering for the hive of ghouls... those are more fun to deal with
<Cypresswolf> Ill be playing in the dark. always better in the dark! Butterflies will be flamed ^_^
<BEN> I also enjoy the musical stylings of Queen and Caravan Palace!
<Midnight_Tempest> Queen <3

<otakon> guys
<BEN> Cypresswolf: Challenge the ghoul to a dance battle!

<MahBoi777> otakon: chaotic isn't it?
