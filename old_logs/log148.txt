<Revolver> can't I just maim him?
<SploogeTheFish> inb4 something we already saw about 10 minutes ago
<Revolver> I'm too lazy to kill him...
<Shutterfly> hub is too cool
*CloudRunner preping to call Surprise to change everyponies aditude
<Denied_Existence> 3Denied_Existence is not responsible for Flutterpsycho, FlutterRage, random thrall creation, mindflaying, or homicide.
<SploogeTheFish> Hub plays the most badass movies. *nostalgias*
<Revolver> I am though
<Revolver> So send me all of your hatemail!
*CloudRunner deep stare at Revolver.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01do you get the plan or not?!
<Revolver> Remember, I caused this!
<Denied_Existence> 3Remember: Denied_Existence, my logic may be insane, but soon you will be too!
<Revolver> I do!
*CloudRunner pops out of pack and stealt hugs!
<CriticKitten> Of course. If I'm online, of course.
<Revolver> That's why I have a machete!
*Veewave sends love and tolerating mail to Revolver
<CloudRunner> this song is epic
<Flutterz> love this song
<CriticKitten> Why are we killing him again, btw? Is it for The Last Airbender?
<Flutterz> Shrek 2(which was crap, tbh) and Bandits :P
<CriticKitten> 'cuz I'm completely onboard with that reason
<SploogeTheFish> inb4 that movie must not be played here againn
*Denied_Existence 3©1993
<Flutterz> which one, Splooge?
<SploogeTheFish> Real life action
<SploogeTheFish> The one played at 2:00 PM
<Flutterz> ah
<CriticKitten> Oh, so that is the reason?
<CriticKitten> Okay, totally okay with the murder plan then.
<Denied_Existence> 3No, Silvermane, not Silverscreen
<CriticKitten> Oh. Close enough.
<SploogeTheFish> Im getting a little bored of AMVs and PMVS
<Denied_Existence> 3You can blame Silverscreen for "The last airbender" I think
<Revolver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kyDa5JVGFk
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I WILL KILL HIM
<Denied_Existence> 3Peddle your music elsewhere!
<Fluttershy`> 08,01THAT CHEATING BAST**D
<Revolver> Never!
<Revolver> also
<CriticKitten> They both have Silver in 'em. Which reminds me of the second Fantastic Four movie. Which fills me with annoyance. Ergo, murder is probably okay. Probably.
<Revolver> I think you censored that wrong
<Veewave> Good night.
<Flutterz> night, Vee
<Revolver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB_Olb-wLxc
<CriticKitten> Oh, wow, it's 2 AM EST? Huh. Couldn't tell.
<Denied_Existence> 3Shoo! Shoo I say!
<Revolver> NEVAR!
<CriticKitten> I should hit the hay myself. G'night everypony
<Shutterfly> oh yeah this one
<Flutterz> yay~ Ponycraft
<Fluttershy`> 08,01KILL KILL KILL
<Denied_Existence> 3Goodnight CriticKitten...if you find Silvermane Dead in the morning, please call the cops.

<Revolver> wow

<Fluttershy`> 08,01no...
<Flutterz> Please? :(
<Fluttershy`> 08,01no.... -puts her head in her hands-
*CK|Asleep hugs Fluttershy` for good measure before sleeping
<Flutterz> Pweese?
<Fluttershy`> 08,01-shakes her head, sobbing-
*Revolver drinks some vodka
*Flutterz cries with Fluttershy'
<Shutterfly> SCII was good
<Denied_Existence> 3Once again, Denied_Existence™ is not responsible for any and all FlutterMassacres.
<Revolver> Again
<Revolver> I am
<Revolver> In some way
<Shutterfly> portal II LD
<Shutterfly> :D
<Pinkamina> Who am I
<Pinkamina> Oh.
<Natleyn> Welp, after I'm done killing myself via pony sadness, I'll sleep.
<Natleyn> But I'm only halfway through this thread, so I'll probably still be here for an hour or so....
*Denied_Existence 3is willing to cheer up Natleyn.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01.....
<Natleyn> I doubt anything could help me right now, but I sincerely appreciate the sentiment, Denied_existence
<Denied_Existence> 3:D
<Natleyn> :3
<Fluttershy`> 08,01............;_____;
*Flutterz there there
*Natleyn pats Fluttershy` on the back
*Fluttershy` 8sniffles. "How could he...?"
<Flutterz> that's just how some ponies are, nothing anypony can do
<Shutterfly> hwhat
<Natleyn> Waiting for that evil laugh~
<Shutterfly> lololol
<Shutterfly> meme faces
<Natleyn> Run, Luna! Run! D:
<LordCelestia> This is my video
<Shutterfly> at least she has company this time XD
<LordCelestia> LMAO
<LordCelestia> BEEYETCH
<Denied_Existence> 3I did not say i couldn't cheer you up too Fluttershy`!
<Denied_Existence> 3I would hug you...but I have the sneaking suspicion you might beat me with a stick...
<Denied_Existence> 3Meh, worth the risk
*Denied_Existence 3hugs Fluttershy`
*Flutterz hugs Fluttershy'
*Fluttershy` 8twitches
<Denied_Existence> 3Hmm...well I guess I can move my mindfuck count up to 2....
*Natleyn hugs Fluttershy` again
<Denied_Existence> 3First SuperBrony, now fluttershy....
<Shutterfly> superbrony was here

<Natleyn> You mindfucked SuperBrony? O_o

<Natleyn> Sleep well!
<SploogeTheFish> I will see you tomorrow guys
<Denied_Existence> 3Good night
<Denied_Existence> 3And yes, I mindfucked Superbrony by messing with his logic in every way possible.
<Shutterfly> Denied_Existence: what do the +'s mean/
<Shutterfly> ?
<Flutterz> I'm pretty tired too, so I'm gonna go hit the hay
<Denied_Existence> 3It means we have voice/halfop
<Flutterz> Night everypony
<Shutterfly> ah

<Fluttershy`> 08,01XD
<Revolver> hey Denied_Existence try to mindfuck me
<Shutterfly> Fluttershy`: did same thing
*Fluttershy` 8hands Flutterz a knife
<Flutterz> lol
<Flutterz> thanks, I guess
<Denied_Existence> 3At this rate, I might beat Discord in the villain primary!
<Revolver> nah
<Fluttershy`> 08,01be prepared -whispers it-
<Flutterz> just don't do anything you'll regret while I'm gone, okay Fluttershy'? :)
<Revolver> try to bloody mind fuck me DE
<Revolver> just try it
<Revolver> I fucking dare you
<Natleyn> My body is ready, D_E.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01okay
*LordCelestia has a moon cannon in case of emergencies.
<Denied_Existence> 3I could try, but your stubbornness and refusal to accept even the truth might hamper things
<Fluttershy`> 08,01maybe
<LordCelestia> and a minigun.
<Revolver> nah
<Shutterfly> good song
<Revolver> I can accept the truth
<LordCelestia> Funny thing, is that the first time i ever heard this song was on a different pony video.
<Denied_Existence> 3Did you know I can walk through two doors at once?
<Revolver> well
<Revolver> it is possible
<Natleyn> I suppose.
<Denied_Existence> 3Go ahead, how do you think it is?
<Natleyn> Would portals count as doors?
<Denied_Existence> 3I am talking about in our universe.
<Revolver> 2 doors right in front of each other so that you would go through both of them when you would step through them
<Revolver> done
<LordCelestia> Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
<Natleyn> D_E, DOOR WITHIN A DOOR
<Natleyn> YOU MUST GO DEEPER
<Denied_Existence> 3No, I would be going through one door first if it was like that Revolver
<Revolver> is that really your mindfuck?
<Revolver> well
<Revolver> then
<Revolver> doorception maybe?
<Denied_Existence> 3Nope, our universe, remember.
<Revolver> like a door within a larger door
<LordCelestia> no u cant yes i can
<Shutterfly> ah this song
<Natleyn> Doors within doors exist here :l
<Denied_Existence> 3Two /regular/ doors
<Fluttershy`> 08,01two doors face each other in a hallway! you stretch your legs so you are spread out in both doorways
<LordCelestia> CAAAAAN
<Denied_Existence> 3Nope, still wrong
<Revolver> meh
<Revolver> fuck it
<Shutterfly> yes i can
<Denied_Existence> 3Any more guesses, or should I explain it?
<Shutterfly> nope chuck testa
<Revolver> explain my good sir
<Natleyn> Go for it.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01wait
<Fluttershy`> 08,01no
<Fluttershy`> 08,01never mind
<Natleyn> I was never good at riddles so I'm practiced at not giving a shit.
<LordCelestia> IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII CANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<Fluttershy`> 08,01thought I had it
<Denied_Existence> 3...
<Denied_Existence> 3You can what?
<Natleyn> He's singing with the stream, bro.
<LordCelestia> NO not this song. I can't understand the words!
<Shutterfly> pinkiepieswear :D
<Revolver> is this really the mindfuck that made FLuttershy` go crazy?
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh, derp
*LordCelestia anti-mindfucks Fluttershy`
<Denied_Existence> 3No, that was a completely different mindfuck
<LordCelestia> all better
<Denied_Existence> 3This is the one that drove SB insane
<Revolver> I want to hear that mindfuck
<Natleyn> Pinkie mother fucking Pie Swear up in this biatch
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I'm actually MP, not Fluttershy` her mind retreated elsewhere
<Natleyn> Welcome, MP.
<LordCelestia> 'ello MP
<Denied_Existence> 3Anyway Explanation starts with a question: If you are inside a building, how do you get out?
<Revolver> through a door
<Revolver> or a window
<Revolver> or wall
<Denied_Existence> 3Yes, but what do you call that for?
<Denied_Existence> 3door*
<Shutterfly> bluh i need to get this song, i dont have it
<Natleyn> Through an exit? :l
<Revolver> double doors?
<Denied_Existence> 3Yes.
<Natleyn> Emergency exit, maybe.
<Denied_Existence> 3Natleyn is correct
<Denied_Existence> 3And if you are outside, how do you get in?
<Revolver> I still like to go through windows or walls more...
<Natleyn> Entrance.
<Denied_Existence> 3Correct again.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01ooooh
<Denied_Existence> 3What if there is only one door?
<Fluttershy`> 08,01now it makes sense
<Natleyn> It is both entrance and exit.
<Denied_Existence> 3Exactly
<Fluttershy`> 08,01both the entrance and the exit at the same time lol
<Denied_Existence> 3And if I go through it, i am going through two doors.
<Natleyn> Assuming you're not multidimensional, you technically only use it one way, though.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01how it is a mindfuck thouhg?
<Denied_Existence> 3Although I am going through one backwards
<Fluttershy`> 08,01it's just... clever mind puzzles?
<Revolver> I don't get the way of that being a mind fuck at all
<Natleyn> In which case it acts as one or another....
<Denied_Existence> 3That was ontop of several other things
<Revolver> ah
<Denied_Existence> 3That was just the coup de grace
<Revolver> is that why she wants to murder Silvermane?
<Natleyn> Tell me some more so I don't have to go back to the sadfic thread! :D
<Denied_Existence> 3No, that was SB, Fluttershy was mindfucked through opportunity
<Fluttershy`> 08,01Fluttershy wants to murder Silver because D_E has convinced her that Silver is cheating on her >>
<Denied_Existence> 3I remember what spawned it
<Revolver> hmmm
<Revolver> this is possibly true
<Revolver> but is hard to actually probe
<Revolver> *prove
<Revolver> also it's all about perspective
<Fluttershy`> 08,01Silver is a player -_-
<Denied_Existence> 3SB was asking me about how his mod application went
<LordCelestia> id imagine he is
<LordCelestia> heheh
<Denied_Existence> 3I told him that I could not disclose that
<Revolver> yeah he is
<Denied_Existence> 3He told me the conversation did not exist.
<Revolver> and it's funny to see when it blows up in his face
<Natleyn> Hah.
<Denied_Existence> 3I then proceeded into some Shrodinger arguments about waveform
<Natleyn> Lmao.
<Natleyn> Schrodinger arguments.
<Denied_Existence> 3I argued that the conversation both existed and did not exist at the same time
<Revolver> His cat is dead
<Denied_Existence> 3But since I was seeing the conversation, at the time it did.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01Shroedinger's cat
<LordCelestia> Im watching Pony Polka again :D
<Fluttershy`> 08,01lawl
<Denied_Existence> 3And it went on from there...eventually he got so nutty that I coup de grace'ed him with that logic question
<Revolver> well I'm listening to 'People=Shit'
<Fluttershy`> 08,01love quantum physics
<Natleyn> Revolver: MY CAT IS DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Natleyn> ect ect
<Revolver> congratulations
<Fluttershy`> 08,01lol
<Natleyn> Or maybe it isn't, or maybe it is, or maybe it isn't...~
<Denied_Existence> 3Really? I think he is alive.
<Revolver> that was also to Fluttershy`
<G3nESiS> go to alex s. dubstep on youtube and play party with pinkie
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I'm pretty sure he's dead
<Natleyn> Denied_Existence: Nope! Never had a cat.
<Natleyn> Or did I?
<Natleyn> Maybe I didn't.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01Then again
<Revolver> did you?
<Fluttershy`> 08,01he's alive
<Fluttershy`> 08,01somehow
<Natleyn> DId I have a cat? o_O
<Fluttershy`> 08,01in another dimension
<Revolver> well
<Natleyn> At one point I did, but I think we gave him away.
<Revolver> I was speaking in this dimension
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I wonder if I can play mind games...
<Natleyn> We're not allowed to have pets, but that one time was an exception...
<Revolver> but in an alternate dimension that is possible
<Natleyn> We found him in the middle of the road, playing with a plastic bag ;__;
<Revolver> seeing as every decision branches off from each other into an alternate universe and keeps on going
<Revolver> meaning
<Denied_Existence> 3But what if you both had a cat, and did not have a cat? And only you saw the cat while all of your visitors thought you were crazy? Or vise versa?
<Revolver> there is an endless amount of alternate universes
<Denied_Existence> 3there are*
<Fluttershy`> 08,01Then you would be declared insane
<Denied_Existence> 3*trollface*
<Revolver> fuck grammar
<Natleyn> Well, they interacted with the cat.
<Revolver> and spelling
<Natleyn> Either I hallucinated them acting with the cat, which I'm fine with, or there was a cat.
<Natleyn> So... either way I win?
<Natleyn> Kitty <3
<LordCelestia> skroo the laws uf speling

<LordCelestia> Wee need to go to the reverse-verse, home of tac nayn, the sworn enemy of nyan cat!
<Natleyn> I've never got a headache or anything from trying to comprehend the universe... but it does bounce back onto my mind, and I get kinda... not dizzy, really, more like I stop thinking for a few sseconds.
<Natleyn> a reboot, so to speak.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01it's like trying to comprehend how we speak
<Revolver> Where would I be now if it wasn't for me being hospitalized for a month after getting the Swine Flu and having a sever asthmatic reaction...

<Fluttershy`> 08,01basically we can just speak
<Fluttershy`> 08,01and we spout out words
<Fluttershy`> 08,01but our mind is putting them together

<SuperBrony64> Denied_Existence: Some bruises on the noggin' and a couple hundred thousand brain cells lost, but I'm recovering.

*LordCelestia places both fingers in both of Fluttershy` s ears . DOUBLE mindfuck :p
<SuperBrony64> It's actually quite painful :D

*Natleyn picks up Fluttershy` and placer her in bed
<GrimGallop> If you're on a road trip and stuck in the back of the car about to fall asleep, don't use bread as a pillow. It ruins any plans you may have had to make a sandwich the next day.
*Natleyn tucks Fluttershy` in, humming "Hush Now, Quiet Now"
<SuperBrony64> GrimGallop: Good to know!
<Natleyn> GrimGallop: This
<Sumica> by the looks of my earthquake sensors (cat sleeping on lap) I would say no, no earthquake.

<Tovler> Actually it was a Dream World Abra.
<SuperBrony64> Tovler: CHEATER
<Core> So, now we're watching the comlete history of the Soviet Union arranged to the melody of Tetris?
<zaco> lol JC_denton
<Core> complete*
<zaco> lets go take down some NSF
<SuperBrony64> lulz, I'm not even watching the stream :P
<Tovler> Dream World Abra is immune to Spikes, Poison, Burns, etc. Fuck yeah

<SuperBrony64> Abra is a boss
<SuperBrony64> So, you ponies ready for the awesome stream tomorrow?
<SuperBrony64> It's THE LION KING
<Tovler> Fuck yeah
<Kdude> cool

*Tovler needs to expand his vocabulary
<zaco> (I kid.)
<Core> Tomorrow? Actually, it is morning right here now, so it'll be this evening for me.
<JC_Denton> still got it on VHS
<SuperBrony64> Well, this one will NOT be in 3D for the record. I did confirm is :3
<Core> I think I'll check it out.
<SuperBrony64> Coolbeanz Core!
<Tovler> Is it the Blu-Ray rip?
<SuperBrony64> Does it really matter? :P
<Core> It will begin at 9 PM here.
<SuperBrony64> You're not gonna get 1080p quality.
<SuperBrony64> As much as we wish for that.
<Core> So the timing is more or less perfect for a movie night thing.
<Tovler> Glory to the Soviet Union
<SuperBrony64> 2 PM EST…whenever that is for you
<SuperBrony64> Let this be a reminder: USE http://www.bronystate.net tomorrow.

<Tovler> Yo, when is the Special Wicker Man event?
<SuperBrony64> Wicker Man event?
<Tovler> Wicker Man was denied as a B movie because it was planned for something special.
<SuperBrony64> Well, I don't know anything about its denial. But as for any special usage of it, I'm not sure.
<SuperBrony64> Even if I did know, that's classified information :P
<SuperBrony64> Just keep your eye on the newsletter if anything does show up about it.

<SonGopaul> I WANNA GO!!!! [/Applebloom]
<Apokalipse> Guess what guys
<Apokalipse> Cage is a vampire
<Diftraku> got to love USB3
<JC_Denton> this video '"i never asked for this"
<Diftraku> 6.94GB of music to the stick in 6 minutes 37 seconds
<Diftraku> 24 MB/s transfer rate :P
<SonGopaul> I'm surprised no one made a meme out of that bar scene
<JC_Denton> are you a wizard?
<Diftraku> I am Tim, the Enchanter...
<Sumica> you have a thumdrive that can use usb3?
<Diftraku> Ee-yup
<Diftraku> And an external 1tb hdd as well
<Sumica> what a waste of cash =p
<Diftraku> Not really :P
<JC_Denton> i still got usb 1 :(
<Diftraku> My old one is dying badly and I got the ports on my PC
<SonGopaul> hehe not the bees, reminds of the PONIES anthology
<SonGopaul> where they dubbed that part onto Celestia
<Sumica> the external is good it's what mine is. But a thumb drive seem pointless.
<Diftraku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxhFd_vr7Rc
<EspyLacopa> Thumb drive brings portability.
<Diftraku> I could use dropbox/my own webspace/etc but that has one limitation
<Diftraku> My upload bandwidth is insanely low
<Diftraku> Compared to the one on the thumbdrive
<SonGopaul> hehehe that tanky thing puts a whole new meaning to Angry Birds
<SonGopaul> AWW WOW BIG BLUE!
<SonGopaul> still doesn't beat Pinkie Pie is Invincible
<Sumica> or freeezie
<Sumica> oh my, I did not think luna would put that one on here.
<Sumica> I showed it to her as a joke.
<EspyLacopa> Diftraku: There's also the security aspect of depending on a cloud for file transfers.
<Diftraku> Ee-yup
<EspyLacopa> As in, you typically have no control over the security.
<Diftraku> Looking back at what happened with LastPass then they noticed some odd network traffic
<Sumica> no I get that it's fast and secure but how often will you need to transfer the contents of the drive or be under a time crunch to do so?
<Diftraku> They really freaked out because they spotted some odd bits moving around
<Diftraku> And pretty much had the entire userbase reset their passwords and encryption keys to make sure all the encrypted bits on their server that might have been stolen were worthless
<EspyLacopa> Better to have it and not need than need it and not have it.
<Diftraku> And they were not even sure anything was stolen
<Diftraku> They just spotted some odd traffic in their network
<Diftraku> Paranoid? Yes
<Sumica> yeah in this case it sounds like a copout EspyLacopa
<EspyLacopa> Heh, animated Ponygeist banner
<Diftraku> It's awesome :P
<Sumica> indeed
<Sumica> I like this video way too much, must be cause it reminds me of niconico
<Sumica> Night all
<EspyLacopa> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/272/c/d/cd99adfe363981fb3f4f29bdafac1772-d4b6oqr.jpg <-- Chainsaw Sword horn sheath.
<EspyLacopa> Heh, BronyState has added me to their google+ circle
<Diftraku> Wait... someponies actually use G+?
<EspyLacopa> I signed up for it, because why not. I already use gmail.
<Diftraku> Oh lawl
<Diftraku> Just realized the new pony thread on MMO champion is at almost 7k posts
<Diftraku> It was created 4 days ago
<EspyLacopa> Ponies are slowly but surely taking over the intarwebs.
<EspyLacopa> Just think where we'll be in a year.
<Diftraku> That's an average of 72.7 posts an hour
<Diftraku> 0.02 posts every second
<Kdude> there is nothing else i'd rather have take over the internet tbh
<Turgle> EqD almost 50M page views
<Diftraku> lawl
<Diftraku> I did some math
<MantisToboggan> the last 10M on eqd have gone super fast
<Diftraku> The old thread averaged at 66.5 posts per hour
<Diftraku> We're now going about 6.2 posts an hour faster with this pace
<Diftraku> And the old thread was live for ~150 days
<Turgle> witch thread?
<Diftraku> So, the new thread should be at 261720 posts in same time if we keep the pace
<Diftraku> http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/987084-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic-(part-2)
<Diftraku> Old thread: http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/893666-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic!
<EspyLacopa> MLP:FiM is a phenomenom, kinda like WoW was for MMOs.
<Turgle> wat, 1001 pages
<Turgle> no
<Turgle> 11968

<MantisToboggan> mop kinda sucks though
<Revolver> yeah
<Revolver> I'm a metal brony too
<EspyLacopa> Master of Puppets?
<Revolver> Main reason why I posted it
<Revolver> I wonder what metal bands would become bronies....
<MantisToboggan> i think any europower band
<Revolver> I think it would be interesting to see Slipknot become bronies
<MeteorVenture> i think metal mario would be a brony
<Revolver> I wonder about Cataract
<MeteorVenture> david crowder aint metal but i could see him being a brony easily
<Revolver> FFDP as bronies
<SploogeTheFish> Is this playlist STILL going on? Or is somebody streaming currently?
<Revolver> Cant say
<Revolver> I'm on my iPod
<MeteorVenture> the leetstreet boys probably already are bronies
<SploogeTheFish> Im listening to skrillex at 10:42 AM.
<SploogeTheFish> Its on about 100 volume. My parents can sleep later.
<DashWithRainbows> yes the playlist is still going on
<DashWithRainbows> its in the main theatre...
<Revolver> Ewes
<Revolver> Workload
<DashWithRainbows> but i dont know who is streaming...
<Revolver> Damn you iPod!!!!
<Revolver> Ewwwww Skrillex
<SploogeTheFish> Oh well. I cant handle not listening to them.
<Revolver> I cant handle not listening to Chimaira, Slipknot, Etc
<SploogeTheFish> True.
<SploogeTheFish> I dont really listen to chimaira, But i understand where your going.
<DashWithRainbows> im guessing its prince-dari who i streaming pmv's...
<SploogeTheFish> CONFOUND THEM!
<SploogeTheFish> "100 people clicked on the subscribe button on accident" Is this a subscribe special or something?
<DashWithRainbows> im guessing so
<DashWithRainbows> slowed down mlp theme o_o...
<SploogeTheFish> Sounds bad.
<SploogeTheFish> What we always need is a techno remix or dubstep...There choice.
<SploogeTheFish> Sort of like now.
<Revolver> I'm
<Revolver> Just going to keep listening to Fear Factory
<SploogeTheFish> WoW dwarf? Damn, To think i quit it years ago.

<EspyLacopa> To the MOON!
<SploogeTheFish> *Duck Tales moon theme plays)
<SploogeTheFish> We all have learned something
<DashWithRainbows> Jackie Chan = best chan
<Revolver> Nope
<SploogeTheFish> Down to simple beeps and meeps...They can be the best songs.
<EspyLacopa> Go go Jackie.
<SploogeTheFish> Go Go power rangers.
<SploogeTheFish> *Talking about the old one, Not the shitty new one
<EspyLacopa> mighty morphin' power rangers!
<SploogeTheFish> I still have a power rangers fighting game on my SNES
<Shad> lol you're streaming already?
<DashWithRainbows> never watched power rangers as i thought it looked shit
<SploogeTheFish> I never watched it much
<TheDukeofFail> the original power rangers is MY CHILDHOOD
<DashWithRainbows> its only random vids / pmv's
*EspyLacopa had power rangers game on game gear.
<TheDukeofFail> I tried watching it recently
<TheDukeofFail> but it turned out to be terrible
<Shad> so this is a long ass prestream
<EspyLacopa> ...I think I still have it.
<TheDukeofFail> definite nostalgia there
<TheDukeofFail> * EspyLacopa had power rangers game on game gear.
<TheDukeofFail> :O
<SploogeTheFish> The new Power Rangers are shit.
<DashWithRainbows> Nostalgia = earlier today
<TheDukeofFail> I had a power rangers game on the game gear
<EspyLacopa> Hmmmmm.
<DashWithRainbows> all thanks to luna xD
<SploogeTheFish> Lol this video?
<Shad> I HATE PEARS
*EspyLacopa checks ye olde game gear case
<TheDukeofFail> you selected a ranger
<TheDukeofFail> and then fought through a series of enemies
<TheDukeofFail> and you got zords and stuff
<TheDukeofFail> I was awful at it
<SploogeTheFish> I HATE PEZ! I ABSOLUTELY HATE PEZ!
<TheDukeofFail> really really bad
<TheDukeofFail> :|
<SploogeTheFish> But i love pz
<SploogeTheFish> *pez
<SploogeTheFish> Oh shit.
<Shad> so much dr whooves
<SploogeTheFish> This video played at like 12:00 pm
<SploogeTheFish> This shit be repeating.
<EspyLacopa> Good lord I had forgotten how huge the game gear was.
<TheDukeofFail> lol
<TheDukeofFail> and how quickly it ran out of batteries
<EspyLacopa> Ah, the game I have is based on the Power Rangers movie.
<EspyLacopa> 4 sonic games. . .1, 2, triple trouble, chaos
<Shad> speaking of games
<Shad> THE GAME
<DashWithRainbows> CELESTIA DAMN IT SHAD!
*EspyLacopa wonders if it still works
<Shad> SUDDEN FAT GINGER
<SploogeTheFish> lol
<SploogeTheFish> I keep thinking of runescape when it was the shit.
*SploogeTheFish gets a nostalgic feel
<SploogeTheFish> Oh god...2007 was fucking awesome.
<SploogeTheFish> So was 2008-2009
<Shad> maplestory used to be the shit too
<SploogeTheFish> Yup.
<Shad> until they updated and changed the shit out of everything
<Shad> then i quit
<SploogeTheFish> Shad, Thats exactly what happened to dear old runescape.
<SploogeTheFish> It went through 3 changes
<SploogeTheFish> But one change was actually good.
<DashWithRainbows> mfw i had this playing while playing Halo Reach and completely raped asses
<MeteorVenture> LOL "Why does liking anime and video games﻿ make someone "socially dysfunctional?" Believe it or not, we've had fans get engaged / married to our songs, so they definitely aren't "virgins" and "losers." Or are you just insecure about your own sexuality?" - leetstreet boys
<EspyLacopa> I prefer the Dash video for the Hercules song, "You can do the Distance"
<SploogeTheFish> I just miss runescape.
<Shad> Streamlag anyone?
<DashWithRainbows> nope.
<SploogeTheFish> Yup.
<DashWithRainbows> i had some earlier
<SploogeTheFish> Yeah.
<DashWithRainbows> but it went away before the other video started
<Shad> going to refresh
<MeteorVenture> oh.. didn't realize there was a stream going on
*SploogeTheFish logs into runescape in the first time in 2 years
<Shad> I spent about 11 months getting to level 100 in maplestory, to later find out I could get to level 100 in a month
<Shad> what a waste
<SploogeTheFish> Feels bad man
<Shad> so basically they fucked over all the beta players
<Shad> and said hey noobs, you can level easy
<SploogeTheFish> I still havent got to level 90 in RS
<SploogeTheFish> Or got a masters cape
<SploogeTheFish> Feels bad
<EspyLacopa> Never got into Maplestory.
<SploogeTheFish> I played maplestory until i got to level 39
<Shad> early maplestory was the shit
<SploogeTheFish> I lost interest after that
<SploogeTheFish> True
<Shad> after big bang just no
<SploogeTheFish> Has anybody played runescape here through 2007-2009?
<SploogeTheFish> I sure did.
<MeteorVenture> i quite runescape cause the horrible people who play it.. not that the game was really that bas itself
<MeteorVenture> quit*
<MeteorVenture> bad* argh
<Shad> FLUTTERSHYS
<Shad> o:
<MeteorVenture> they either didn't talk to you when you were clearly talking to them or they were scammers or just punks
<Shad> maplestory players got a lot worse now
<Shad> everyone sits afk saying FAME UP
<Shad> nobody interacts
<MeteorVenture> it was kinda the same way when i played
<Shad> I really wonder what made them decide to make such huge changes when the game was doing amazing
<MeteorVenture> maplestory was a pretty good game for being free though.. i mean these easy exp updates are just a terrible punch to the face of all your faithful fans.. but the game WAS good i figured
<MeteorVenture> just not great like i cared for
<Shad> I FOUND NON OF THESE APPS
<Shad> I DISAPPOINT
<SploogeTheFish> hub, I AM DISSAPOINT
<Shad> someone made a old spice big mac commercial
<Shad> mfw
<DashWithRainbows> always reminded of Command and Conquer from this
<AllisZero> MFW I wake up to nukes being dropped in Ponyville
<Shad> THE TOWN IS EXPLODING
<Shad> I NEED TO GRAB MY DOORMAT
<Shad> WUT
<AllisZero> This song
<Shad> Generosity online
<Shad> LOLLUNA
<AllisZero> THIS IS REALLY WHAT HAPPENED
<Shad> nope
<SploogeTheFish> what luna did for 1000 years
<AllisZero> This song reminds me of Explosions in the Sky so much
<Shad> SAY WUT
<AllisZero> Time to mute the stream
<AllisZero> That song makes Allis mad
<Shad> but it fits
<Shad> ^-^
<AllisZero> I don't think of Rarity as a disgusting, self-serving whore
<Shad> suddenly skipping
<Shad> stream's at 2 pm EST right?
<DashWithRainbows> yes
<Shad> I'll be afk till then
<DashWithRainbows> i cleared my weekend for this event,

<Veewave> ^ yup
<AllisZero> Well
<AllisZero> Knowing the other characters
<AllisZero> There's no way she won't be likable
<FlaschenJoe11> Firefly is best pony
<Veewave> But if she isn't we'll still love and tolerate the crap out of her.
<Veewave> hmm doesn't sound right, FlaschenJoe11.
<AllisZero> I need to make a MLP theme for my WoW client
<AllisZero> I already have a Holo one
<Emmett_Brown> My catapult shoots a ball bearing 5 metres :D
<FlaschenJoe11> Firefly is Lauren Faust favourite pony
<FlaschenJoe11> and the base for Rainbow Dash
<FlaschenJoe11> so she is best Pony
<Veewave> Orly?
<FlaschenJoe11> YA RLY!
<AllisZero> Everypony is best pony

<Zephirdd> Luna is best pony
<Zephirdd> AND best mod
<Zephirdd> AND best streamer

<FlaschenJoe11> YAY~!
<MantisToboggan> i don't like snails and snips
<Zephirdd> lol, I only hate owlowlicious
<MantisToboggan> and owlicious would've been okay without the "who?" puns
<MantisToboggan> he is jsut there to make a spike-heavy episode
<MantisToboggan> which is fine
<FlaschenJoe11> brb walking the dog
<AllisZero> Well, main characters at least
<EspyLacopa> http://www.hjo3.net/orly/gal1/orly_lemmony.jpg <-- o rly?
<Veewave> Remember to stab Silvermane when he enters chat everypony.

<DashWithRainbows> not really up for murder today

<DashWithRainbows> its easy, just say that your a brony and if he has any problems with it, he can leave anytime he wants
<McGoerk> well convert hio to the herd; everpony is better off becoming a brony
<Luna> 07,01indeed
<Luna> 07,01I even converted my bf :)
<LordCelestia> OF ANYTHING, I'll hypathetically ask my dad if he would have a problem with watching a kids show that thousands of other people happen to enjoy too
<LordCelestia> Then laugh about it if he said "THATS GAY SON"
<DashWithRainbows> if i said that to my dad, well, i hardly ever see him so i dont care what he thinks
<LordCelestia> Also, being in high school at the time, letting people find out that (Name withheld) watches My Little Pony would make my life a living hell...
<prince-dari> My parents don't give a shit.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 phffff

*Veewave pulls out mlp toys "lolwut?"
<Kdude> ive told pretty much everyone i know that i <3 my little pony
<LordCelestia> I dont care what people think either, but, eh, I'm an easy target for getting the shit teased out of me.
<LordCelestia> But other than that I usually have a fuck the world attitude.
<Kdude> not a single one of my friends gets why i like it though...
<Zephirdd> Kdude: maybe they have to watch it to understand
<Zephirdd> :D

<Fluttershy`> 08,01I likes it
<Tovler> I like the Krayt Call
<fluttercry> not nostalgiac enough but it's still cool
<Tovler> It reminds me of Steven Magnet
<Emmett_Brown> Lions live for ten to fourteen years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than twenty years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than ten years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity
<ThePretender> Whoopi Goldberg was one of the best parts of this movie.
<TrickQuestion> mfw I chose to watch lion king with bronies reather than play LoL
<Flutterz> I was like
<Flutterz> OMG LOOK AT TEH TIME

<TrickQuestion> hearing it though?
<Veewave> Nala:"oh~~~!"
<Silverscreen> inb4 Second best song.
<Apokalipse> When fluttershy started giggling like crazy I thought that it was worth recording
<combustiblelemons> aww this is my second favourite song D:
<Silverscreen> or is it third?
<crono_flash> foreshadowing
<ThePretender> bahahaaha
<Tovler> Africans don't talk like African Americans.
<Natleyn> EQD!
<Natleyn> D'awwww

*ThePretender runs to check EqD
<Octavia> 13<3
<Zephirdd> that comic
<Zephirdd> is sooo cute
<Flutterz> yes
<Tovler> JTT is 30?
<deliopen> Is the stream going? (I am on bronystate.net)
<Zephirdd> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=cookiesonsundaynight
<Zephirdd> deliopen
<Tovler> get it? Mane effect?
<Silverscreen> This level was a pain in the ass on the Sega Genesis game. x.x
<Zephirdd> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=cookiesonsundaynight deliopen
<Zephirdd> ...
<TrickQuestion> is watching pictures, but atleast I can hear it right
<combustiblelemons> I saw a video called simba and nala go to whitecastle which made this song just hilarious
<TheMaster> oh god, flashbacks to the gameboy game
<CopperCogs> Yes
<Rainbow_derp> is it working now, at cookies?
<saturn`> hmm, by my estimations, if you guys used amazon cloudfront as a cdn, it'd cost you about $130 to serve an hour of 1mpbs video to 2000 users
<CopperCogs> This level was a pain on the sega
<Veewave> lol
<TrickQuestion> dont know if I ever played it
<fluttercry> was I the only one that didn't play the game?
<Stonegaze> This lag is agonising.
<Silverscreen> CopperCogs: I know. The timing needed was horrible.
<deliopen> So the stream isn't working on the site?
<Dashite> fluttercry nope
<combustiblelemons> hang in there stonegaze
<TheMaster> so did anyone see this in 3d?
<saturn`> it'd probably be far more reliable and faaar less laggy than this
<Veewave> I messed this level's face up on the sega
<saturn`> but it wouldn't be free
*Silverscreen didn't see the 3-D version.
<TrickQuestion> Stonegaze, can you hear it?
<CopperCogs> Yes you did TrickQuestion we played this game all the time
<Natleyn> 's cool Silverscreen.
<Dashite> Nah, can't stand 3D movies.
<CopperCogs> You might not remember it though
<TrickQuestion> when? I dont remember
<Silverscreen> I want to see the Stage version of this, though.
<saturn`> Veewave: on the pc version, if you were paused it and turned turbo off (on a 486) it'd crasht the game
<TrickQuestion> that woudl be awesome
<CopperCogs> When we were little duh
<combustiblelemons> I can't bare 3D movies either
<TrickQuestion> Ricks?
<TrickQuestion> or was it at home?
<Zephirdd> what was the game name? the complete name?
<Zephirdd> I feel the need to dl it right now
<combustiblelemons> the glasses are annoying :/
<fluttercry> 3d gives me headaches
<Silverscreen> The Lion King
<Stonegaze> TrickQuestion, The audio work but the viedo lags quite a lot. It lags especailly when I turn on the chat.
<Luna> 07,01me too
<CopperCogs> No at home
<combustiblelemons> same fluttercry
<Flutterz> dat rape
<Rainbow_derp> I can't do 3d movies, i ware glasses
<CopperCogs> We had a Sega if you remember
<TrickQuestion> huh, dont remember it at all
<Tovler> suddenly, graveyard
<SlurryMoon> I thought the 3D movie was pretty amazing
<deliopen> Oh well, I'm an hour late due to an Eastern > Western time miscalculation :P
<Flutterz> you can put the 3d glasses over normal ones, btw
*Silverscreen STILL has a Sega Genesis
<deliopen> derp.
<combustiblelemons> an elephant rave?
<Grundle> I wear 3D glasses over my regular glasses :p
<Discord> Hey is it true that this movie took some ideas from kimba?
<FlaschenJoe11> the lag gives me head aches
<SlurryMoon> 3D effects were nice on 2D hand-drawn animation.
<TrickQuestion> I remember the sega, I remember sonic and dr eggman's goo machine, and pitfall
<Natleyn> Silverscreen: Still have a SNES :3
<TrickQuestion> just dont remember this
*fluttercry still has SNES
<TheMaster> yeah, there was a movie called "kimba the white lion"
<GGgala> inb4 we watch Kimba the White Lion for BMN
<Stonegaze> I have my old SNES here but ti doesn't work properly.
*FlaschenJoe11 hates his connection
<TheMaster> but its basically the plot of hamlet
*Natleyn brohoofs fluttercry
<CopperCogs> >Dr Eggman's goo machine
*ThePretender has his NES Zapper but not his NES.
<CopperCogs> Really?
<Silverscreen> Discord: Yes, but Kimba took the idea from african legends and fairy tales, so it's not exactly original either.
*Veewave still has a Sega Mastersystem
<GabeMoist> Mr Banana Beak
<Grundle> I have my SNES and some old Atari systems
<FlaschenJoe11> i prefer the name Dr. Robotnik
<Rainbow_derp> so the new 3d glasses fit over glasses?
<Bjornfot> Mr. Banana Beak!
*fluttercry dad sold his NES by "accident"
<TrickQuestion> dont know what to do for it Stonegaze, but on the other one us was lagging sound a video
*crono_flash has Genesis, SNES, and NES
<Grundle> And a master system with no cables
<TrickQuestion> oh wait, it was Dr. Robotnik wadd'nt it?
<Dashite> Go Ed!
<TrickQuestion> my bad
<CopperCogs> Really Trick it was Dr. Robotnick's Mean Bean Machine
<TrickQuestion> whatever, you knew what I meant
<Rainbow_derp> oh noes!
*combustiblelemons 's dad sold his original pokemon card collection worth £1200
<Silverscreen> Mean Bean Machine was fun. Reminded me of Dr. Mario.

<Grundle> Jet Set Radio was pretty awesome :p
<Kdude> lag is making me sad....
<combustiblelemons> I miss the 90s to 2000s. those were the golden days of consoles
<Silverscreen> The Dreamcast system itself was ahead of its time, but it was given so few GOOD games.
<Natleyn> VioletVanilla: Do you have Jojo's Bizarre Adventure? :0
<Luna> 07,01I'll just re-stream the entire thing

<GGgala> ...And?
<fluttercry> I'd like a hot dog please
<TrickQuestion> never played any civ games

<VioletVanilla> 06inb4 links Val
<VioletVanilla> 06XD

<Combustiblelemons2> my frustration for Civ5 was my computer can't handle it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh u violet :P
<Dashite> Combustiblelemons2 :(
<Combustiblelemons2> D:
<Sumica> my freustration for civ 5 is it liked to crash at 75 citys
<[ger]Brony1> No terraforming is bad.
<VioletVanilla> 06Por que?
<Pegacorn> .....
<Combustiblelemons2> oh dear sumica
<Sumica> and the multy was rushed
<CloudRunner> you were the one who joined me right Veewave?
*herospirit hasn't eaten today.
<Saturn``> hey guys, wanna know something interesting?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's one reason I like Civ3 so much, having so many cities wasn't a massive drain on your computer
<Saturn``> i'm vpn'd into my EC2 instance from the UK, and it's pretty much eliminated my lag
<CloudRunner> herospirit: neither have I. woke up a few hours ago
<Dumori> you know your a pro torrenter whn you are uppting twice as fast as your downspeed is
<ValtheJean> 2,14 unless you played that WW2 Global map, that thing was a beast...but totally worth it
<Dumori> :\
<Natleyn> herospirit: GET SOME FOOD, SON
<Sumica> but civ 5 is fun when you have giant mech's wandering the earth
<Dashite> ValtheJean, yeah but you couldn't do anything with that many cities because of the corruption.
*Natleyn shares his three cheese pizza with herospirit
<Octavia> 13Now you're making me want to play it again...
<GGgala> eeyup
<ValtheJean> 2,14 phfff, that's why you build the forbidden palace
<Dumori> 3 times now...
<Dumori> x3
*Veewave just went to the Cloetta factory and baught a bunch of candy
*ThePretender should reheat his leftover pizzas...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 corruption is easy to overcome
<Dashite> Forbidden Palace only helps so much.
<SuperBrony64> Test
<Veewave> *bought
<GGgala> wish i had that 'problem' XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you just have to be willing to pay for it
*LunaTheForgotten fixes chicken wings.
<herospirit> Anyone who was here last night, I apologize for my SUPAR ANGST
<[ger]Brony1> That's why i only play on small maps.
*Natleyn huugs herospirit
<Luna> 07,01alright here we go
<Natleyn> ALL IS FORGIVEN
<VioletVanilla> 06~yay~
<ValtheJean> 2,14 besides, my outlying territories are just meat shields for invasions anyway
<CloudRunner> herospirit: Good nights sleep has destroyed that sad feeling I got from that fic btw. I have officialy gotten over it and will never be made emo by it again. sleep deprivation aparently makes me a little emotional... :/

*VioletVanilla hugs Octavia
<Dumori> I'm hoping to have 4 times it soon
<herospirit> Anyways. I think I'm probably going to be crashing sick and tired today or tomorrow.
<Combustiblelemons2> my only problem for age of mythology was creating your own levels was almost impossible
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Dashite: grudge? I assimilate those asswipes

<Dumori> sucks
<Stonegaze> I'm gonna ignore the chat during this movie. It's going to be tough.

<[ger]Brony1> That's the move with the tree?
*GGgala steps forward to clamp the chains on Pegacorn's limbs
<RAWRity> Oh this movie. It's so bizarre to see Robin Williams in a dramatic role.

<Lasharus> That's novel.
<Octavia> 13I'm probably not going to talk much during this movie, going to be too busy watching it. lol
<LunaTheForgotten> Chat always works.

<Tovler> Everything is perfect in the beginning of the movie. You know what that means.
<LunaTheForgotten> I'm finding it hard to watch the movie and the chat.
<RAWRity> Word to the wise: If you EVER have a romantic date that ends watching a sunset, somebody's getting cancer.

*DashWithRainbows has lost interest in this movie and is watching other stuff

<CloudRunner> LordCelestia: What Dreams May Come
*Flutterz hugs ThePretender
<LordCelestia> WHAT DREAMS MAY COME!?

<Flutterz> reincarnation? really?
<SlurryMoon> Does this mean that all religions are true?
<RAWRity> Wait...reincarnation? This movie just switched mythos on me

<GGgala> reincarnation. TAKE THAT, Abrahamic religions!
<Pegacorn> I guess it IS true.

<Combustiblelemons2> Reincarnation is what I believe in
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's not so much switching as it is a giant hybrid of everything
<VioletVanilla> 06Rawrity, nope. In HER heaven, Reincarnation is what she believes in.
<herospirit> Mix ALL the religions!
<Shadizzle> If you mixed all religions
<Tovler> If only this movie was at least 1500 years old.
<Shadizzle> your mind would literally be fucked
<Ghosties> 04Pretty much, it's a hybrid of every religion
<Natleyn> Damn you fast, EqD
<GGgala> that doesn't make sense. all of those people are from their own heavens.
<VioletVanilla> 06IT was the trucker's fault.
<GGgala> so yeah, it's a mix.
<Bjornfot> It's utterly sad and pathetic that some people really believe in "heaven".
<CloudRunner> is that his... nope
<prince-dari> Ghosties: I see no Pastafarian in this.
<herospirit> We'll call it Robin Williamism

<Shadizzle> LIKE A BOSS
<Bjornfot> I like to believe it's SCIENCE
<Kdude> screw your lemons! i dont need lemons!
*Polarfire sips soda
<Octavia> 13Bjornfot, oh u :P
<CloudRunner> Bubububu baby you just aint seen nothing yet
<The_Si> Hold God at gunpoint. It worked for Stan Smith.
<Combustiblelemons2> It's a trap!
<Sumica> did this movie just turn in to LOTR?
<prince-dari> MFW science is about 100% made up and guesswork. :P
<SuperBrony64> 10,2No need for a religious debate. Take this movie for what it is ;)
<Combustiblelemons2> oooh the river styx
<Tovler> Science is not a belief, it's fact
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dari....
<RAWRity> I believe the afterlife is a game of Dodge Ball, where I can do the matrix leanback whenever I want
<Bjornfot> srsly, anyone claiming anything SCIENCE hasn't proven is just stupid
<Ghosties> 04Indeed. Please guys, let's just enjoy the film
<Shadizzle> inb4religious war
<prince-dari> I'm not religious, but to call people stupid just for their beliefs seems small-minded to me.
<Denied_Existence> 3Sorry, I am a man of science. Understand god is not my job.
<Purple`Prose> It's like a cross between Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings
<Combustiblelemons2> greek death theory time!
<GGgala> mfw dari is using some bizarre definition of 'made-up'
<DashWithRainbows> MFW CHAT HAS NOW TURNED INTO A FLAME WAR
<deliopen> What Denied_Existence said.
<Bjornfot> i never said people are stupid, just their beliefs
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ENOUGH
<CloudRunner> SuperBrony64: Exactly!
<MeteorVenture> anyone claiming science claims things they think cause they think it is stupid
<RobotPinkie> 06,15But any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable magic, and magic is friendship, and friendship is ponies...... so science is indistinguishable from ponies, I guess.
<CloudRunner> prince-dari: that Is how I think as well
<Bjornfot> lolwut^^
<Ziltoid> Stop.
<Tovler> who said what now?
<The_Si> Movie now, beliefs later.
<SlurryMoon> Styx?
<Luna> 07,01but before the pony eps start...
<Denied_Existence> 3Dammit prince-dari! Stop summoning cthulhu!
<Ziltoid> Hammer time
<Natleyn> induringflamewar
<Octavia> 13I figured we'd get a little religious debate because of this movie. :P
<Luna> 07,01I have something Unique to share with everypony
<Tovler> I could go for some circular glasses.
<Diftraku> Ia ia...
<Arentius> o.O
<Combustiblelemons2> I see religion like this: you can take the red pill or the blue pill...
<Shadizzle> BRB
<Bjornfot> there is no "debate" in religion
<SuperBrony64> 10,2No need for more religious comments guys.
<Diftraku> C'thulu
<Ghosties> 04It doesn't help when Bjornfot and dar are exacerbating things
<Combustiblelemons2> you know the rest.
<Diftraku> F'tagn
<Purple`Prose> I have a pair of circular shades. They're awesome
<Ghosties> 04*dari
<Arentius> now i'm uber curious
<Shadizzle> love and tolerate everyone's religion
<Lasharus> Quite so.
<Shadizzle> k
*Dumori sips wine
<Bjornfot> no
<prince-dari> Bjornfot: A lot of science hasn't been proven.
<Octavia> 13Well, lets not egg it on by speakiong of it then SB :P
<herospirit> I thought Dari was remaining a nuetral party?
<Luna> 07,01please stop the color spam
<CloudRunner> Shadizzle: there you go
<fluttercry> Hey listen hey hey listen hey hey listen. Let's NOT go down this road
<Luna> 07,01it's getting annoying
<prince-dari> Phsyics for example is a lot of 'WTF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS'
<CloudRunner> what Luna said
<fluttercry> I agree with Luna
<RAWRity> Guys. Listen. This movie is dealing with the metaphysical, not religion or science. It's fantasy for the sake of telling a story. Stop going into shit like this.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01color spam?
<Tovler> Let's have a good old fashioned furry war.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01are you taking about what Dari's doing?
<CloudRunner> what prince-dari is doing
<Sumica> oki now I can see what SuperBrony64 is saying.
<CloudRunner> yes
<Pegacorn> ......
<Luna> 07,01yep
<ThePretender> disregard chat, watch movie
<Bjornfot> i tolerate religious people
<Bjornfot> but not religions
<Bjornfot> they just cause evil
<GGgala> dari, implying there is no such thing as a stupid belief?
<SuperBrony64> 10,2Bjornfot: Move away from the topic. Just watch the movie.
*herospirit is off to get dressed and find food
*Edward_Newgate doesn't think Dari realises that he's undermining his argument with his terrible color choice
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay that's where I draw the line. This little flamewar has gone on long enough. If people keep going on about this, I'm going to start kicking
<Fluttershy`> 08,01oh. yeah. Dari stop being a color troll.
<Ghosties> 04Bjornfot, enough
<CloudRunner> grab my arm. ADVENTURE!
<Ghosties> 04I will ban you
<Bjornfot> oh come on guys, don't just sit there!
<VioletVanilla> 06Dat colour. .
<Ghosties> 04Stop forcing this and just stay away from the issue
*GGgala pokes Pegacorn
<Turgle> http://pics.kuvaton.com/kuvei/irl_troll.jpg
<GGgala> and dat ban threat, Bjornfot
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Just try to enjoy it as a wacky fantasy movie, Bjornfot :P
<Ziltoid> dat bullshit answer
<Tovler> no religion debate would complete without the "arguing on the internet is like running in the Special Olympics" That quote is super old.
<Bjornfot> not the first time
<Bjornfot> i'm not very scared
<Octavia> 13lol Tovler, indeed
*CloudRunner in b4 cathulu
<Diftraku> So true with that
<The_Si> And they called it a MINE.
<Bjornfot> but i think i'll stay in here for a while
<deliopen> This reminds me a tad of the second half of Gurren Lagann
<GGgala> Heh. Giggling at the Ghosties?

<Combustiblelemons2> the nether!

<Lasharus> So I suppose other things aren't necessarily a problem in these situations.
<RAWRity> it's a joke.
<Ziltoid> nope

<Leadhoof> That guy's voice...makes me want to play Skyrim. More. Now I can't stop thinking about it. :[
<Bjornfot> but i AM surprised that a mod called me an asshole
<GGgala> PMing insults is a whole new line there.
<CloudRunner> sock... clopfic...?
<deliopen> Ogod, thanks a lot leadhoof :P
<Tovler> Mr. Freeze did an excellent Ahnold in B&R. It sounded just like him.

<CloudRunner> yes
<DashWithRainbows> celestia and the magic door...
<RAWRity> robotpinkie OH GOD NO
<prince-dari> You were being an asshole.
<prince-dari> Ghosties tells it like it is.
<Leadhoof> I can't help it! D:
<prince-dari> He's blunt.
<prince-dari> He always has been.
<RAWRity> PSYCHIATRY
<DashWithRainbows> ponies with flank-warmers.... okay this guy has lost it
<Polarfire> This is true :/
<RAWRity> WHAT A TWEEST
<CloudRunner> oh shit what!
<Shadizzle> Secret door fun

<Ziltoid> what
<Apokalipse> eeyup, it is

<CloudRunner> black doctor turns white when he dies!
<Lasharus> he used to be Morgan Freeman?
<Rainbow_derp> wow!
<Shadizzle> HE USED TO BE BLACK?
<Sumica> wait the black guy is white and the white guys is black?
<Shadizzle> HE'S MICHAEL JACKSON?
<Lasharus> (sorry :P)
<ThePretender> HAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<DashWithRainbows> ponies...with flank warmers
<kirzstryfe> lol
<GGgala> and the white girl is Asian
<deliopen> Dis movie is mostly confusing.
<Arentius> *facehoof*
<Tovler> Uncle Ruckus is so jelly
<DashWithRainbows> anyne know where he lives so i can kill him?
<ThePretender> I forgot about that part....
<LordCelestia> ASians are hawt ^
<[ger]Brony1> Discord in a maid outfit? I am not going to google that.
<Lasharus> You know, that'd be immensely painful, compared to an ordinary facepalm.
<Shadizzle> Oh lordy
<Bjornfot> well, i guess
<Sumica> wait that was his daughter?
<Bjornfot> but i also just said it as it was
<MeteorVenture> that first video.. is pretty sick
<LordCelestia> Hey guys I have that one friend here with me who actually knows I like ponies :p
<RAWRity> [ger]brony1 that is a good decision
<kirzstryfe> depends on if there's a horseshoe involved
<Arentius> only if i was twilight...all the others manage not to hurt themselves with such actions
<kirzstryfe> or socks
<Arentius> luna has all the socks
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I MADE IT
<DashWithRainbows> LordCelestia nice :3 say hi to him/her for me!
<Lasharus> Well, the only reason it hurt Twilight is because she poked herself in the eye.
<Apokalipse> Well you were warned to stop
<prince-dari> You said things even though you knew they'd provoke people.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01wahaha
<LordCelestia> He says Hi too
<thehated5689> so luna, are these reastreaming at 11:56 as violet said, or after this?
<Arentius> exactly...close eye first THEN facehoof
<kirzstryfe> and pinkie is made of rubber and cotton candy, so it wouldn't hurt her
<Edward_Newgate> I'm a terrible, terrible person
<LordCelestia> (hes is my only real life friend who somewhat likes ponies too
<LordCelestia> lol
<RAWRity> I just showed my Bronyism to my friends in a big way. I showed them my NaPoWriMo fanfic.
<Arentius> so what happens if you throw water on her? does she partially melt/
<Bjornfot> eeeyup
<DashWithRainbows> why am i watching the EQD post....
<Lasharus> "so's most of the house mr. Williams. Do pay attention"
<Bjornfot> but, free spech, you know?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, the sets and CG in this movie are pretty good at least.....
<Lasharus> I suspect the outer shell is the rubber Alex.
<VioletVanilla> 06True RobotPinkie~
<Arentius> the hair is clearly cotton candy
<LordCelestia> I like how he flied.
<Purple`Prose> And the music, too
<thehated5689> o nvm
<Denied_Existence> 3....
<Apokalipse> No. This is the internet
<Rainbow_derp> anypony want the discoard maid outfit pm me
<Combustiblelemons2> I gotta say the cg is really well done
<deliopen> TRIPPY MOVIE IS TRIPPY D:
<Luna> 07,01yep
<Apokalipse> You can't just apply that here
<prince-dari> Well if you tell Ghosties that, he might agree with you, he's very big on the whole 'free speech' thing.
<Bjornfot> but yeah, i also know that americans tend to be very sensitive, especially with religious topics
<VioletVanilla> 06SCARED ME
<kirzstryfe> just gets less bouncy with water
<prince-dari> For me, there is no 'free speech' here.
<Denied_Existence> 3What the hell was that about?
<ThePretender> so where are we at, Luna?
<kirzstryfe> it only gets wet with chocolate rain
<LordCelestia> Whys he callin his wife his neighbor??? What did I mkiss?
<Fluttershy`> 08,01huh?
<Sumica> what happend to the sad though?
*Edward_Newgate already has the picture
<LordCelestia> *miss
<RAWRity> we're near the end.
<Arentius> pinkie can never be less bouncy
<VioletVanilla> 06After this thehated :#
<VioletVanilla> 06:3 *
<CloudRunner> this is about to get wierd
<Denied_Existence> 3*Points upwards* That stuff....
<prince-dari> You can't say things that break rules here, that's how I feel.
<RAWRity> lordcelestia She doesn't know she's dead
<VioletVanilla> 06I was quoting what time it was currently
<RAWRity> she thinks she's still alive, and he's a stranger.
<thehated5689> different time zones
<Fluttershy`> 08,01Oh. SuperBrony64 isn't authorized to be in here yet.
<LordCelestia> But doesnt she recognize her own husband???
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I think he just got banned.
<thehated5689> its only 6 here
<deliopen> She's insane, mostly.
<RAWRity> no, she doesn't remember her family at all
<Shadizzle> she's on cocaine
<LordCelestia> I guess not.
<Apokalipse> Exactly. You can't go saying things somewhere if the mods don't want you to
<CloudRunner> hell is vary hell
<deliopen> SPIDERZ

<LordCelestia> SPIDERS! GET EM OFF ME! GET EM OFF ME
<Polarfire> I <3 free speech but also recognize that certain topics ruin chat for people... which the primary objective of chat is to talk to others while you watch the movie
<RAWRity> OH GOD NOT SPIDERSES
<Kdude> im arachnophobic :C
<CloudRunner> epic feel time
<thehated5689> arachnaphobia hated understands her fear :#
<Denied_Existence> 3Yeah I saw

<Saturn`> fluttercry: make one
<Combustiblelemons2> wow
<Apokalipse> the mods
<Bjornfot> how can you know?
<Dumori> The mods
<Combustiblelemons2> it's a small world
<CloudRunner> Spiderses...? what is that
<Polarfire> That being said, I don't get offended over practically anything...
<LordCelestia> Byebye DashWithRainbows
<Dumori> you don't
<Apokalipse> You were warned
<prince-dari> That's at the discretion of the mod.
<Sumica> no bronys here >_<
<Polarfire> so IDGAF
<Octavia> 13Hes got a lot of red facial hiar that makes me giggle. Hes pretty random and funny.

<Polarfire> yeah
<Bjornfot> well, yeah i was warned, and i stopped

<MeteorVenture> take care dashwithrainbows :D
*Natleyn hugs DashWithRainbows goodbye
<VioletVanilla> 06This lady is a jerk D;
<Natleyn> Sleep well!
<Luna> 07,01alright now i'm clueless
<Polarfire> what dari said I guess
<Apokalipse> You needed to be warned several times
<Combustiblelemons2> why?
<prince-dari> You should use your own common sense when posting though.
<VioletVanilla> 06Bai Dashie~
<Purple`Prose> She's dead and crazy
<Rainbow_derp> sleep well dashwithraibows dream of ponies 4 me
<prince-dari> You continued after you were warned.
<fluttercry> bye DashWithRainbows
<CloudRunner> this lady is not a jerk she is in hell
<Combustiblelemons2> I'm too lazy to log out and back in :P
<Bjornfot> "common sense"
<Rainbow_derp> sleep well dashwithrainbows dream of ponies 4 me
<Bjornfot> well, just a little bit
<LordCelestia> Did somebody say CANNON?
<Pegacorn> May i take your attention off of that subject to move to the more pressing matter of I AM CHAINED TO THE GODDAMN WALL YOU LAZY BASTARDS.
*LordCelestia prepares his moon cannon.
<Denied_Existence> 3You need to set an exemption methinks
<[ger]Brony1> CloudRunner: Spiderses is the best Fanfic since Repercussion of Evil
<Luna> 07,01I did...
<prince-dari> Common sense, you knew it would be sore topic with users.
<Shadizzle> HIS?
<prince-dari> You posted it anyway.
<Shadizzle> HIS!?!?
<Fluttershy`> 08,01it put him to -e agian
<Fluttershy`> 08,01again*
<Luna> 07,01yea..
<fluttercry> And then John was a zombie
<Bjornfot> i didn't know it would be THAT sensitive
<Shadizzle> MALESTIA
<CloudRunner> I may have to read it.
<prince-dari> Fair enough, you were warned to stop.
<prince-dari> You continued.
*GGgala puts a hoof to Pegacorn's mouth
<Bjornfot> i believed my right for free speech was greater
<deliopen> I was just curious.
<Lasharus> LordCelestia? I may have to attack you if you shout that one.
*Polarfire smacks Pegacorns ass
<CloudRunner> [ger]Brony1: It wont make me overly emotional due to a death will it?
<Polarfire> YOU'LL WAIT TILL THIS IS OVER
<Bjornfot> but i stopped pretty soon after warnings
<GGgala> Shhh. The big ponies are talking.
*LordCelestia cannot be attacked. He only attacks.
<Apokalipse> Seriously dude... you're misinterpreting that right
<Bjornfot> what exactly did i say after being warned?
<[ger]Brony1> Well, Spike got killed, but he gets better.
<Lasharus> I am Lasharus. Trust me, I can attack.
<Apokalipse> Rights don't apply here where they have rules
<Lasharus> :P
<Luna> 07,01alright we need Dari :)
*Pegacorn kicks Polarfire in the face
<Bjornfot> yeah
<Denied_Existence> 3Sorry luna, I think Chanserv hates us today
<Lasharus> Possibly.
<Ziltoid> SOULESS BITCH
<LordCelestia> ^mean
<LordCelestia> but true
<LordCelestia> hehe
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<Bjornfot> easy Pegacorn, we'll continue playing with you soon~
*Polarfire reminds pegacorn that he is chained up, and can't kick anything
<prince-dari> Bottom line, you have been banned before, you've had warnings, you won't get any more chances from me, you ignore mods again and I will ban you. With no appeal.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01maybe you need to make an exception through ChanServ?
<Kdude> how long left for this film btw, i have to go to bed :(
<Lasharus> She managed it in Party of One though.
<Bjornfot> geez, gohsties already said all that
*GGgala grabs Pegacorn's legs and tightens the chain to the wall anchor
<[ger]Brony1> And, CloudRunner: Nopony is getting made into baken goods in that fanfic.
<Combustiblelemons2> i'd guess 20 minutes
<Arentius> she wasn't physically less bouncy
<Arentius> she just didn't feel like bouncy
<prince-dari> No, I need to add them to the access list.
<prince-dari> Give me a minute.
<Ziltoid> spoilers they all die
<Lasharus> I think she actually WALKED in that episode.
<RAWRity> what did I miss?
<CloudRunner> [ger]Brony1: ok. so long as nopony gets their head kicked in or cut to bits I should be ok
<Lasharus> Any questions?
<SuperBrony64> What did she tear up?
<Bjornfot> and i asked again: what exactly did i say AFTER being warned?
<fluttercry> Spoilers:He died
<Luna> 07,01see we needed dari :P
<deliopen> this still flashback?
<Arentius> she walks in the pilot episodes
<Purple`Prose> Their divorce papers

<Saturn`> i'm kinda sorry for that, but only kinda :P
<TheMaster> is this the robin williams movie with heaven/hell?
<RAWRity> Wow, the Broncoes are getting their shit kicked.
<Purple`Prose> Yes
<prince-dari> I don't have to explain myself, and my reasoning to you, nor do any of the mods. On this occasion I'll humour you though. Give me a minute.
<kirzstryfe> and pinkie never walks, she just bounces closer to the ground
<[ger]Brony1> I can see the dead.
<CloudRunner> like always RAWRity. But I still root for them every time they play
<bandgeek> he did die

<Bjornfot> i was alreayd typing out when the warning was given, i didn't see it until i was done
<kirzstryfe> so I've never had a chance to see this movie, but did it end up being "B" because it's really bad, or because its message is beyond most people?
<VioletVanilla> 06>:

<deliopen> lol
<Roxas> or Bi-centenarian man mode
<[ger]Brony1> He won an Oscar for this?! Must have been a slow year in Hollywood.
<scorchman> W00t! Just got out of work and I missed the Lion King! Who has two thumbs and is majorly sad? This guy!
<TheMaster> its what happens when good actors make to many good movies. they become too expensive.
<TheMaster> or he's just tired.
<GGgala> i think that's more of a server thing than a #bronystate thing...
<CloudRunner> guts... and sweetness...?
<RAWRity> scorchman don't worry, they're-streaming it after this
<CloudRunner> I dont want another cupcakes bassed on this
<TheMaster> I love hamlet with lions personally.
<Combustiblelemons> she's still discordified
<Sumica> he was off naming his kid zelda and making Gameboy ad's
<scorchman> everything went better than expected
<CloudRunner> lol
<Bjornfot> More precisely: Is it ok if I pastebin Ghosties and mine conversation?
<Saturn`> CloudRunner: have you read Fluttershy Goes to Hell?
<Roxas> she's going to take out her rape whistle any second now, I know it
<Bjornfot> Quite a few people have requested it.
<scorchman> cya guys later, need to do chores.
<Pegacorn> I HATE YOU GGGALA
<Dumori> it's possabely against the law
<Kalisia> bye you
<Roxas> See ya scorch!
<RAWRity> Jesus Christ, 41-17, and it's not even 4th Quarter yet.
<Bjornfot> And since it's sent rhough the internet on a public server...
<Dumori> it's a private convosation
<[ger]Brony1> You played a game you couldn't win. You got trolled by god.
<prince-dari> We don't have any actual rules about it.
<Ghosties> 04RAEP TIEM!
<prince-dari> Though that makes the whole 'private message' system rather null.
<TheMaster> thats pretty awful rawrity.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah I fail to see the amazing or the sad here...
<Dumori> thus making it public with out all partys consent is an privicy issue
<Bjornfot> mostly because he assaulted me
<Scarthceroth> did i miss it?!
<Sumica> Time for hell
<Roxas> Ghosties: HELL YEAH!
<Lasharus> miss what?
<Combustiblelemons> FOREVER AND EVER
<Tovler> lol Broncos
<thehated5689> hes so creepy
<GGgala> not really any different from pasting an IM convo from anywhere, nothing to do with #BronyState
<Scarthceroth> oh ok there is a stream going
<Lasharus> :P
<Rainbow_derp> today tomarrow and forever
<Lasharus> Hey again Scar.
<LordCelestia> ohai tarin
<Bjornfot> he was very upset, and i understand that and forgive him, and he has apologized
<Scarthceroth> oh hai lash
<deliopen> inb4 he wins anyways
<CloudRunner> epic feel time
<Scarthceroth> do you know what the schedule for this theatre is?
<Dumori> then we let it lie
<Roxas> hey, when is he going to start raeping her?
<Rainbow_derp> lol
<kirzstryfe> almost over I think?
<Dumori> simple as
<deliopen> in a minute, roxas.
<deliopen> :p
<Bjornfot> but i thought it might be a good example
<Rainbow_derp> ...
<RAWRity> roxas that's not 'til the sequel
<LordCelestia> NOW.
<GGgala> yeah.
<Bjornfot> that mods aren't perfect either
<Lasharus> All I know is that there'll be 2 pony episodes after this film, then a restream of the Lion King, apparently.
<Tovler> I keep hovering over the movie to see how much time is left.
<LordCelestia> RAEP TIEM
<Dumori> they are people
<deliopen> lol Tovler, I used to do that too.
<Scarthceroth> i meant what days do they stream?
<Dumori> it's hard to be objective all the time
<kirzstryfe> I like that better than my anser :D
<Dumori> god do I know it
<Bjornfot> he only said all those things because it was private
<CloudRunner> going to do some chores. brb.
<prince-dari> We never claimed to be perfect.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Moar epic CG plox!!1
<deliopen> GAME OVER.
<Dumori> I've modded some flamly forums
<Sumica> DOOOM
<LordCelestia> "Enough with the shakin', it's time to get RAPIN'!"
<ThePretender> DON'T GIVE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
<kirzstryfe> Friday/Saturday
<TheMaster> and suddenly they're both playing amnesia
<Scarthceroth> its sunday....
<Bjornfot> he would never have said all that in a channel
<deliopen> CONTINUE? [y] [n]
<RAWRity> THIS SUMMER, ROBIN WILLIAMS IS....ORPHEUS
<CloudRunner> oh shit!

<Lasharus> Yup.
<CloudRunner> BOOM!
<Ghosties> 04He was never ever supposed to look at her
<Scarthceroth> ok
<Combustiblelemons> Acid trip time!
<Scarthceroth> when does it start?
<prince-dari> I know Ghosties.
<Scarthceroth> or rather how long ago did it
<Lasharus> That I'm not sure about.
<Ghosties> 04And he did that as soon as he found her
<deliopen> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pillar of salt time, Ghosties? :P
<Sumica> time for a kick
<deliopen> this is dante's, not orpheus.
<RAWRity> well, nobody said Robin Williams wasn't a Cock Up
<kirzstryfe> pre-show on friday around 2pm EST, movies start around 7pm
<Scarthceroth> ok
<Luna> 07,01correct
<Dumori> Put simplely mods have to follow their own rules. If they don't then they feel worthless at best
<Scarthceroth> so at around 7 then
<kirzstryfe> saturday the shows usually start around 2pm EST I think
<Ghosties> 04LUCY, I'M HOOOOOOOOOOOOOME
<Scarthceroth> ok
<Bjornfot> "if you ever disrespect my feelings and my beliefs again I will thoroughly and actively make sure that you don't get a chance to see another movie with us"
<TheMaster> you know. I don't think that place would be heaven for someone with allergies
<Scarthceroth> sounds good
<fluttercry> creepers gonna creep
<ThePretender> and this part is new to me, didn't catch it the first time I saw it
<Luna> 07,01also all information is in our newsletter, facebook, google+ and twitter

<ThePretender> HE DID IT
<Sumica> is this the part where he gets out his top and spins it but we dont see it fall?
<Bjornfot> that's just way over the line and personal
<Purple`Prose> GOOD END
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and then everypony came.... the end
<deliopen> lol yes Sumica.
<Rainbow_derp> if this was the devine comidy they did it wrong.
<LordCelestia> GAME OVER.

<Luna> 07,01well I can add you to our newsletter subscriptions
<Ghosties> 04I DON'T KNOW YOU! *pawnch*
<kirzstryfe> bug Luna to get yourself on the email list :)
<Dumori> agreed
<Combustiblelemons> they're in heaven :o
<Luna> 07,01indeed
<RAWRity> what's weird is, earlier today I was watching Jumanji
<Scarthceroth> oh cool
<TheMaster> eh, dante's divine comedy is just a self-insert fanfic
<RAWRity> it's like it's Robin Williams day
<Scarthceroth> hey luna, im bugging you
<Tovler> he died in hell and is now in double heaven.
<LordCelestia> inb4 a "Everybody died. The end" reference.
<Scarthceroth> bug bug bug
<prince-dari> You've broken rules, he's within his rights to ban you.
<Lasharus> That's not very nice.
<Luna> 07,01PM me your e-mail
<Lasharus> Just ask politely.
<[ger]Brony1> I don't know you, but you are a hot pussy, so i will act, like i am your husband.
<Luna> 07,01and i'll add you
<Ghosties> 04Can you do that? Can you die twice?
<Lasharus> :P
<Bjornfot> of course
<RAWRity> but everybody DID die.
<Roxas> huh, seems like he made sure to complete that post-final dungeon to get the best ending
<Sumica> but everybody did die, like in the first 20 min of the movie.
<Rainbow_derp> lordcelestia little late 4 dat
<Bjornfot> but that was just very biased and personal
<LordCelestia> daw damn it all
<Fluttershy`> 08,01to the mooonaaaaaaaaaaah
<deliopen> Mandatory "They all died. The end." LordCelestia :3
<Sumica> hell the kids did't even make it through the opening credits
<LordCelestia> HEY
<Scarthceroth> this is kinda embarrasing, how do i do that/
<LordCelestia> MOON
<thehated5689> thatsssss a nice alternate reality u have there
<Polarfire> That's how ghosties is :/
<LordCelestia> IS
<The_Si> XD
<LordCelestia> FOR
<prince-dari> It may have been, but it also only applies when you break a rule which is general.
<LordCelestia> ME
<LordCelestia> :3
<Scarthceroth> nvm
<Luna> 07,01double click my name
<Polarfire> I figured that out my 2nd day here
<Lasharus> Double-click Luna's name in the list of users to your right.
<Lasharus> :P
<Roxas> nope.avi
<TheMaster> you are on a train!
<LordCelestia> I like trains
<CriticKitten> All you have to do is take a cup of flour....
<TheMaster> or waiting for one
<Roxas> choo-choo!
<TheMaster> I forget the quote
<LordCelestia> Add it to the mix!
<Polarfire> several months ago now
<[ger]Brony1> He has to go deeper.
<Scarthceroth> :$
<fluttercry> Trains rock
<Combustiblelemons> once there was a happy family. They were so happy that everyone died. The end :3
<Flaria|Seapony> Welcome back, The_Si
<Dumori> ghosties is ghosties
<Sumica> You are waiting on a train but you dont know where it's going.
<deliopen> Darnit, I missed an opportunity to quote "HIGHWAY TO HELL. I'MMONA HIGHWAY TO HELL".
<Roxas> F*** YEAH TRAINS
<prince-dari> Therefore how personal it may seem is irrelevant, it'd be the same as if he'd said "you disregard our rules again and I'll ban you".
<The_Si> Cbe
<RAWRity> critickitten you got it wrong: All you have to do is take a cup of pony, add it to the mix
<The_Si> *Cheers
<Bjornfot> yeah, he's human too
<GGgala> And Bjornfot is Bjornfot, so...
<Dumori> but then Bjornfot is Bjornfot
<TheMaster> seriously, what if you had allerges or were afraid of outdoors?
<Polarfire> THEREFORE
<LordCelestia> NO RAWRITY NOT CUPCAKES
<TheMaster> totally not heaven
<Dumori> it's not a valid argument
<LordCelestia> DAMN YOU
<GGgala> ninja'd, Dumori
<Polarfire> I <3 EVERYONE
<ThePretender> The power of love <3
<Bjornfot> i agree with him
<deliopen> then you change it, TheMaster.
<Bjornfot> and i still love him
<Pegacorn> Bjornfot is Bjornfot?MY GOD.
<deliopen> I'd make it a metropolis, I s'pose.
<Sumica> good news mom the kids are back. bad news they dont look like you any more.
<LordCelestia> If you even talk about cupcakes I will KILL you.
<Scarthceroth> yeeeerrr!
<[ger]Brony1> What happens if the real pictures get burned to dust in RL, because they are not worth anything?
<TheMaster> so my heaven would be watching mlp fim forever
<Polarfire> SHUTUP
<LordCelestia> POISONALLY
<Scarthceroth> what movie is this?
<Bjornfot> NEW SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY
<CriticKitten> Hm, true, they should add a cup of pony to this film.
*Polarfire smacks pegacorns ass again
<Bjornfot> Bjornfot=Bjornfot
<Sumica> suddly creeper.
<TheMaster> "oh look, your dog is in heaven too"
<Combustiblelemons> SSSSSSSSSSSS
<Rainbow_derp> noooo
<thehated5689> DOGGY!
<kirzstryfe> "What Dreams May Come" I think
<Scarthceroth> are they in a painting?
<LordCelestia> MAMA IM COMIN HOME
<ThePretender> YES
<Lasharus> More or less.
<RAWRity> suddenly there are no more black people in the movie
<Pegacorn> DAMNIT POLARFIRE
<ThePretender> YES
<deliopen> inafter sappy ending.
<Rainbow_derp> i killed so many creepers
<prince-dari> Didn't they have 2 kids?
<ThePretender> YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
<Saturn`> everyone is dead and happy!
<[ger]Brony1> It's the gay daughter
<Rainbow_derp> today
<TheMaster> so does everyone end up in heaven at the same age/size that they died?
<Sumica> one kid is the dog now.
<Scarthceroth> Y U NO PHYSICS?!
*Polarfire stuffs a rag in Pegacorns mouth
<ThePretender> DAT HAPPY ENDING <3
<SuperBrony64> So wait, are they all alive again?
<Combustiblelemons> dogs go to heaven. problem, catholics?
<GabeMoist> and then they went to hell, The End
<deliopen> They look like they want to, TheMaster.
<TheMaster> oh, cool.
<LordCelestia> I'd like to be a tree
<Lasharus> They're all dead. By that point physics sort of takes a back seat to events.
<Ghosties> 04No, they're all dead but in Heaven
<Saturn`> Combustiblelemons: only good dogs
<RAWRity> sumica kind of. You get to choose your appearance
<Kdude> running hug scene? really? i am disappoint...
<Roxas> woah, 100% completion ending! sweet!
<[ger]Brony1> Nope, they all live in that paintings of hers.
<TheMaster> so what if you wanted to look like someone else?
<Tovler> Now we are a family again
*Pegacorn spits the rag out
<kirzstryfe> physics are overrated
<Sumica> and they all stayed dead happly ever after.
<Saturn`> not like hitler dog
<Dumori> I have to say though the lines in #BronyState are wonky
<LordCelestia> This ending needs to be about 20% sexier.
<Combustiblelemons> i wonder if there's such a thing as an evil dog
<Bjornfot> uhu
<Apokalipse> I think they're fine
<TheMaster> reincarnation? in my christianity? its more likely than you think
<RAWRity> themaster you can. that was part of the twists in the movie.
<FlaschenJoe11> "All Dogs go to Heaven"
<[ger]Brony1> Yes. Sooooo, where is the sun? He stayed in hell?
*thehated5689 am dissapoint
<deliopen> lol Cerberus much Combustiblelemons?
<Dumori> we get one religious "attack" big flames
<Rainbow_derp> brb gonna eat some oats.
<ThePretender> awwwwww
<Apokalipse> Obey the rules set out and if there is confusion ask a mod
<[ger]Brony1> *son
<Roxas> and then Wheatly falls like an asteroid kills everyone again
<Roxas> THE END
<Dumori> right now theres a hell of a lot of "attacks" on homosexuality
<Combustiblelemons> true deliopen
<Sumica> See you in hell again huh.
<GGgala> atm?
<deliopen> LOL The sun stayed in hell, [ger]Brony1?
<fluttercry> They need to go to SPAAAAAAAAAACE

<thehated5689> roxas has won the internet
<Ziltoid> FOREEVER
<Dumori> yeah on and off
<Saturn`> SPAAAAAAACE
<CloudRunner> Combustiblelemons: Ceberus

<Saturn`> Jersey's nothing like Hull
<Scarthceroth> jersey is super hell
<Saturn`> er, Hell
<LordCelestia> Im in space! bap bap bapbap bap bap bap
<Dumori> people calling out their daughter as gay repatedly due to short hair
<Sumica> it was nice.
<SuperBrony64> I agree, great movie.
<fluttercry> Really awesome movie.
<Polarfire> The big ponies aren't done talking yet.
<Bjornfot> Threatened with permaban for stating opinion and discussing a few minutes past warnings?

<NINJA> No I'm a ninja
<Thunder_Dash> What Scorchman said; THERE.
<Scarthceroth> so how did a goddess get tricked by a riddle?
<Tovler> The stock market is more stable than my pony list
<Combustiblelemons> NOPE
<[ger]Brony1> I wondered all the time: What was Twilight thinking?! They never had been in that labyrinth at all.
<LordCelestia> THE ELEMENTS ARENT IN THERE. STOP WASTING YOUR TIME
<deliopen> ohshi-\
<GGgala> He already broke freee...
<FlaschenJoe11> Q is Q-ing again
<Roxas> IT'S NOT IN THE MOTHERF***ING LABYRINTH
<Scorchman1337> Yeah what I said!
<FlaschenJoe11> Maneiac
<Dumori> oh
<GGgala> We still need to secure him again.
<Pegacorn> Nope.
<Scorchman1337> Pary hard!
<Saturn`> hehehehe
<Arentius> because she told her ponies to fix it and said forgetaboutit
<fluttercry> Pinkie and Applejack are probably like"HA HA!"
<Dumori> so why is he yelling?
<Luna> 07,01muhahahaha!
<Combustiblelemons> pinkie and AJ: meh.
<Pegacorn> I'm still on the wall.
<CloudRunner> you just realized that when Fluttershy said can we go home now? they would have not been "Discorded"
<Stonegaze> Priceless!
<Dashite> "We're as useless as Applejack!"
<Scarthceroth> you mean faggetaboutit
<Luna> 07,01he's sooo Tim!
<Apokalipse> GGG Y U LIE?
<Octavia> 13Oh Discord, y u so troll?
<Lasharus> Well, in fairness, Celestia DID act in this time by sending all those letters.
<Saturn`> YOU'RE ALL USELESS EARTH PONIES NOW!
<Scorchman1337> Creeper!
<Lasharus> That counts for something.
<Arentius> true
<Combustiblelemons> BAD TOUCH!
<DrDoctor> the game?
<Arentius> ooo someone in bronystate just made a good point
<Tovler> There are no rules in Calvinball
<Dumori> so he's on the wall not wanting to be free and yelling
<Octavia> 13Oooh dang Dashite
<Scorchman1337> Discord invaded your personal bubble, what do you do?
<Luna> 07,01eeenope
<Dumori> why?
<Arentius> if they had gone home when fluttershy asked to
<FlaschenJoe11> He had so much fun here. He's basically playing Q again
<Combustiblelemons> DISCORD WHY!
<Arentius> they'd all be fine
<[ger]Brony1> Think of the game!
<deliopen> Problem is, there's no rule that HE can't cheat...
<kirzstryfe> except how would she know those were needed unless she was watching the whole time
<prince-dari> He should steal the Earth pony's legs.
<Scarthceroth> only because she doesnt like chocolate milks of glass
*CloudRunner feels bad because of the earthpony hate
<Lasharus> Mmhmm. :P
<Saturn`> lulz
<FlaschenJoe11> *wah wah wah waaaahhhhh*

<Saturn`> awww
<Octavia> 13Shes so dang cute
<RAWRity> WE SHOULD TAKE DISCORD, AND PUT HIM IN ALL THE EPISODES
<Dashite> Dari, he doesn't need to take anything from the earth ponies.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01:<
<CloudRunner> TheMaster: That would be nice to find out
<Saturn`> poor flootershy

*Octavia freaken loves Tom
<Lasharus> I just love that evil laugh.
<Leadhoof> <3 I love that Rarity squeal!
*Apokalipse starts rubbing pegacorn's wings. Oh your feathers are so neat, would be a shame to not show them off
<LordCelestia> IT

<Edward_Newgate> Tom Dan says
<GGgala> You aren't ticklish here, are you?
<Dashite> [ger]Brony1, same here

<Saturn`> rarity has the best voice actress
<FlaschenJoe11> Greedity and Tom
<Scarthceroth> BUT SHE JUST GOT A PONY PEDI!
<[ger]Brony1> What is there not to like?
*GGgala begins fondling the base of his wing at the joint
<[ger]Brony1> Oh hai, Tom!
<Apokalipse> I think he likes it
<CloudRunner> [ger]Brony1: lol
<RAWRity> saturn AND the best singing voice
<Scarthceroth> she'll chip a hoof because of her digging style

<Combustiblelemons> lordcelestia XD
<Scorchman1337> nice LordCelestia

<TheMaster> beat me to it lord
<FlaschenJoe11> LordCelestia I LOVE THAT VIDEO!
<Arentius> its fine, her horseshoes are made of diamonds..so its all ok
<Lasharus> That rock has taken a fair bit of damage over those two episodes.
<CloudRunner> lol LordCelestia
<fluttercry> Rarity and Tom made Rocky
<Pegacorn> Stop it.Stop it.Stop.STOOOOOOOOOOP!
<LordCelestia> Glas it got a positive reaction :D
<Arentius> Tomabuse
<Combustiblelemons> one of my favourite spongebob scenes
<Ziltoid> Tom is best inanimate object
<Scarthceroth> well it is a hard thing
<Lasharus> Noted.
<ThePretender> awwwww
<Lasharus> But still.
<Roxas> LordCelestia, enjoy you internets, you deserve 'em
<Flutterz> Flutterwry incoming...
<Octavia> 13Why does that sound familiar...
<RAWRity> I was just thinking of something: What if, in S2, Rarity and Fluttershy sing a duet?
<Lasharus> Being smashed through a library wall? Twice?
<deliopen> Poor Fluttershy :(
<Fluttershy`> 08,01:<
<Octavia> 13Oh yeah, Spongbob I think
<Arentius> its only a thin wooden wall
<Scarthceroth> well it is a big thing
<CloudRunner> Discord is a fucking cheater!
<Lasharus> This is possibly my favourite scene of this episode.
<DrDoctor> trollershy
<FlaschenJoe11> Trolling the Troll
<Arentius> you probably could have punched through it
<Lasharus> "OH FOR GOODNESS' SAKE!"
<Combustiblelemons> *facehoof*
<Arentius> hollow trees aren't so tough
<Luna> 07,01AH!
*Polarfire drags his hoof across Pegacorn's chest
<CloudRunner> counter troll

<Luna> 07,01you are a fluttershy fan!
<DrDoctor> I <3 her in this scene
<fluttercry> This is why I love her
<Luna> 07,01your in the wrong room!
<deliopen> Discord gets owned a bit here.
<Saturn`> this episode reminds me of this arc: http://www.pholph.com/whole_arc_viewer.php?id=5&sid=1375
<Octavia> 13Oh Fluttershy <3
<CloudRunner> inb4 discord cheats
<LordCelestia> Fluttershy is discord-resistant
*Luna glares
<Octavia> 13So darn cute
<RAWRity> Discord is HIM in general
<kirzstryfe> flutterbitch is best evil pony
<Flutterz> Fluttershy doesn't feed the troll
<Edward_Newgate> Fluttersnide
<Lasharus> Nope, Twilight is my favourite. Sorry Luna.
*GGgala spreads his other hoof across the wing's underside, stroking Polarfire's feathers
<Thunder_Dash> Stood up to giant dragon and stared down a cockatrice? YUP, WEAK AND HELPLESS
*ThePretender is reminded of that comic where creeps him out.
<Ziltoid> OH HE MAN
<Lasharus> But I still adore this scene.

<FlaschenJoe11> he never cheated
<Octavia> 13NUUUUUUU

<The_Si> >~>
<RAWRity> I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
<deliopen> I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
<Apokalipse> I should soooo be sleeping right now. I need to be up at 6am and it's 1:03 xD

<ThePretender> Flutterbitch entertaiened EVERYONE at BroNYCon
<Arentius> and time to cry manly tears of manlyness
<RAWRity> WHEVER YOU LIVE, I KNOW IT
<Dashite> You know, I recall there only being two rules and neither of them dealt with this so Discord didn't cheat...
<Roxas> anyone else notice that Discord always disguises up as their respective cutie marks?
<Edward_Newgate> Everyone calm the fuck down
<Stonegaze> Come at me bro!
<deliopen> Yep roxas :)
<CloudRunner> Inb4 he cheats again
<Luna> 07,01yep

<FlaschenJoe11> choosing between two Loyalties
<Octavia> 13The game. She lost it.
<Dumori> but now I'm unempolyed I dont need to get up
<Dumori> x3
<Apokalipse> I'll stay a bit
<Lasharus> And another Tom-crash.
<LordCelestia> inb4 massive cliffhanger
<[ger]Brony1> Why would Cloudsdale crumble because of the absence of one lousy small-town weather pony?
<Lasharus> *smash*
<Arentius> *le sob*
<FlaschenJoe11> her friends or her birthplace
<Apokalipse> Till the end of this pony episode
<Flutterz> best part is there is no game
<Arentius> whyy dashie whyyyy
<Lasharus> Listen to his umbrella carefully btw.
<CloudRunner> why does she not lie here?
<Dashite> RAWRity, Discord isn't a participant in the game.
<bandgeek> It's all in your mind.
<kirzstryfe> ?
<Combustiblelemons> Brony1: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY??
<Leadhoof> We get to see part two now, right? :D
<Saturn`> the only winning move is not to play
<Lasharus> To those of you who hadn't heard it before - it meows. There is no way to argue with that much awesome.
<Combustiblelemons> It. Is. ON!
<Roxas> DUN DUN DUN
<deliopen> I thought the ending of part2 was a bit rushed, but the rest was really good.
*CloudRunner clings to Octavia's plot... I dont know why
<FlaschenJoe11> CHAOS!
<Thunder_Dash> Title dropping
<[ger]Brony1> Discord is the GM, they are allowed to cheat.

<Roxas> clings to CloudRunner's plot
<FlaschenJoe11> Storm of Chaos was a stupid Campaign
<Thunder_Dash> WINNING
<RAWRity> I thought P2 was rushed a bit too, but after a few more viewings, it really started to grow on me.

<GGgala> then i'm confused
<Lasharus> That... still doesn't tell me much, actually.
<Combustiblelemons> true fluttercry
<[ger]Brony1> Sadly no. First new episode is at the 15th
<Roxas> Leadhoof: no new pony until the 13 in think
<Leadhoof> Shewt. Oh, well.
<RAWRity> WHERE WAS GONDOR'S ULTRAMARINES WHEN FRIENDSHIP FAILED?
<FlaschenJoe11> somewher Fighting Nids i think Stonegaze
<deliopen> There's a new intro?

<Arentius> he likes to comment on us from time to time
<Lasharus> I'm mostly wondering why the hell he's talking about bronies, what's so horrible/awesome about it, etc.
<[ger]Brony1> I am Discord, huh!
