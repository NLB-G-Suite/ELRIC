<MadSurge> Awwwww
<Vordox> Thanks for stream SuperBrony64 =3
<cow334> Later that day they went to go watch My little pony

<Phase4> 00,02"Essentially a bomb on legs, the Sentry Buster will detect any sentry thats dealing sustained damage to the Robot Horde, then initiate its deviously complicated protocol: run at the offending sentry and explode. "
<Spell-of-Gaming> dat question mark in a diamond
<Phase4> 00,02i think the sentry buster's been taking tips from Nittany_Discord
<Dumori> X3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It stole my diary.
<cow334> woot woot ^^
<cow334> who going to stream now...
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: it still can't explode AGAIN though.
<Vordox> Phase4: XD
<Phase4> 00,02awwww, southpark stopped
<thelonepony> someone will
<Dismo> Shizuka: :l did you accept my request, silly girl.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Nice boat.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01True MaidSurge.
<MASF123> SuperBrony64 is gone...I don't want to live on this planet anymore! :(
*SuperBrony64 hugs thelonepony ^-^
<cow334> Moo
<thelonepony> Hugs back SB64
<MASF123> Hey look a cow! :3
<cow334> MASF123: lol
<cow> Mooo
<Spell-of-Gaming> MaidSurge? :3
<Spell-of-Gaming> Random maid reference, I'm guessing? :3
<cow334> woot woot ^^
<Spell-of-Gaming> Skype needs a different port
<S33Ti3> Incoming Mortor!
<Spell-of-Gaming> The Mordor has a Mortor.
<S33Ti3> and she just kept screaming...like what's up with that?
<MadSurge> Oh boy, gone for a weekend and lots of new videos to watch
<MadSurge> Did you guys see the CMC Everfree panel? :D
<MASF123> No I hven't
<cow334> MadSurge: yes
<cow334> it was awesome
<MASF123> I don't keep track of those things anymore.
<MASF123> Not after...what happended.
<cow334> MASF123: it can be hard to
<MadSurge> Wish all girls were that funny :D
<Dark_Horst> MASF123: and what did happen?
<MadSurge> MASF123: I don't follow very much panels...
<Chrysalis> Phase4 what it doesnt list
<Chrysalis> is it will go after the dispenser if the sentry dies in the mean time

<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, i've seen it do it once or twice, but its finicky
<Phase4> 00,02its quite fun to pick the sentry up and leg it
<Derpy123> For Smooze!
<Phase4> 00,02buster gets all confused and attempts to follow
<Smooze> 00,02Derpy123, ITS LORD SMOOZER

<Buytoast> i have one yeah
<Buytoast> oh
*Derpy123 hugs +Phase4
<Buytoast> meh, never played kingdom hearts
<cow334> Buytoast: I played the first one for ps2 it was okay
<MadSurge> I wonder if FiW Fluttershy chants "Bo-bo-bop" during her ceremonies
<cow334> lol
<Phase4> 00,02NOW ITS KERBAL KILLING TIME
<MadSurge> YESH
<Vordox> Dat intro Phase4 :D
<MadSurge> YATATATATATATTATATATATATATAA
<cow334> Ytatatatatata
<cow334> O-O
<Vordox> I had my volume on max
<thelonepony> kaboom kaboom
<Vordox> I do not regret it Phase4 :D
<cow334> my ears have just xploded
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<cow334> i had my volume on full blast to Vordox
<MadSurge> Kerbal time! :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's the blue rocket pony.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02his rocket makes like nittany and explodes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: Lol.
<Vordox> <.< Don't give me ideas atm, I need to focus on this coding
<cow334> Phase4: can you please give me the link to that song
<MadSurge> Chrysalis, next year's Bronystate live event needs more seaponies and kerbals :D

<cow334> Phase4: wy where the comments disabled from that video....it blew peoples inds
<cow334> minds
<MadSurge> Colgate is not a very family friendly name for spanish people...
<cow334> looks like the same animation they use for cars
<Phase4> 00,02so that happened
<MadSurge> ^
<cow334> oh go figure it just said it right there
<Sumica> 00,10ah this one

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So after Planes 3, will they have Trains?
<MadSurge> ^^^^
<cow334> woot woot
<Dark_Horst> waddafaq?
<MadSurge> Are wings still bugged?
<thelonepony> fly u metal bird fly
<MASF123> Hmm...I keep getting a weird message in the stream.
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what music to put on
<Dark_Horst> ...is that a fin propulsion bug again?
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, yes and no
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: more like a wing hovering bug :D
<Vordox> Phase4: Some Daft Punk?
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, some daft punk remix

<Chrysalis> website is offline
<Chrysalis> cant get to stream
<MadSurge> It's going up! :D
<MASF123> yup it is
<thelonepony> daft punk
<Phase4> 00,02you'd think something with soo may control srufaces would be... controllable
<MadSurge> FUCK PHYSICS
<thelonepony> it's a pinkie pie ship
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, its up here
<MASF123> refresh now
<MASF123> it's up
<Chrysalis> yeah just came back up
<Phase4> 00,02but yeah
<Phase4> 00,02it will hover at about 8k forever
<Sumica> 00,10not if you roll it
<Phase4> 00,02true
<Phase4> 00,02but dont do that and it flys forever
<Phase4> 00,02plus its got tonns of fuel
<Phase4> 00,02not controllable unfortunately
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, aparently its not working
<Sumica> 00,10odd how it can float but as soon as you roll it on it's centerline it drops like well it shoud
<Phase4> 00,02i'm climbing still
<Sumica> 00,10no the roll controlls
<Phase4> 00,02no, falling now
<Sumica> 00,10q and e
<Phase4> 00,02climbing again
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i was
<Sumica> 00,10never saw it
<cow334> so much blue and light blue
<thegt90> http://funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/4027004/be+honest/
<Sumica> 00,10odd
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, rolling isnt doing much
<Sumica> 00,10must be once it's highenough
<thelonepony> to all the neigh sayers
<MASF123> Godzilla was there? Lol.
<Phase4> 00,02not exactly falling fast
*Phase4 00,02hugs Shizuschlafen
<Phase4> 00,02sleep well
<MASF123> Wow this Vapor Rub is helping my breathing porblems.

<Shizuschlafen> 13kirzwub
<thegt90> nice pic man
<Dark_Horst> MASF123: well, thes invented it to do that
<MASF123> Lol. "Man"
<MadSurge> Shizuschlafen: Awww that's adorable!
<MASF123> Some many Tabs! :O
<cow334> that looks awesome
<MASF123> Dat Blue pony
<cow334> crash you wont you wont do it you wont you wont
<Phase4> 00,02the debris is still doing loop-de-loops
<Phase4> 00,02should totally try use that instead of a parachute some time
<Phase4> 00,02why not now
<MASF123> Phase4, what's with the rocket on your OC?
<cow334> Phase4: go for it...danm you used a parachute
<Phase4> 00,02MASF123, you ever played kerbal?
<MASF123> no...but I've seen in on the stream and Robbaz play it.
<Phase4> 00,02seen rockets in the early design phase?
<MASF123> no...
<Phase4> 00,02google it and suddenly it will make sense
<Phase4> 00,02MASF123, i'll show one on stream
<MASF123> That screen your OC opens up? It's the chat?
<Chrysalis> MASF123 yup
<MASF123> no...Phase4
<Chrysalis> cause phase always tabs to the chat
<MASF123> Search up Robbaz
<MASF123> :/
<MASF123> Lol
<Dumori> that feel when a torrent is missing a peice...
<Dumori> and the trackers reporting seeds active but I see no eveidence
*Seastallion_of_War is up before the Celestia
<cow334> Phase4: Are yoour past explosions
<Dumori> this peice has been out of the swam for hours...
<cow334> and killing kerbals
<Sumica> 00,10nothing will beat tower of power
<Sumica> 00,10and so many stageing failures
<Dumori> I once built a ring of soild fule boosters round my main rocket
<MASF123> Add moar rockets. :3 Is what Robbaz always says.
<Dumori> once I got it stable
<Dumori> and added a seconed ring stage on top of the soilds of jet fule and stoped it warping
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Going to try and sleep now.
<Dumori> it was WAY too powerful
<cow334> night Nittany_Discord
<MASF123> see you
<Chrysalis> g'night Nittany_Discord
<Sumica> 00,10his launc pad looks so diffrent
<MadSurge> WOOOOOOOO
<cow334> May lunas stars watch upon your sleep
<cow334> you killed so much kerbels Phase4
<cow334> ,_,
<Dumori> the thrust to fule ratio and the stanges droping huge amounts of mass ment as soon as your other shell droped and if you survived that you rocketed out of attmo
<MadSurge> Goodnight Nittany_Discord!
<Sumica> 00,10I can see alot of this guys problem
*Seastallion_of_War is going to look for seaponies as Celestia rises over the Atlantic on holiday.
*Dumori is currenlt working on a rocket laucnhing space plane
<Sumica> 00,10rcs on and full throdel
<Phase4> 00,02wasnt my video
<Phase4> 00,02i went through that stage though
<Phase4> 00,02now i know how to build rockets
<cow334> that was a youtube video.....
<cow334> ._. i failed
<Phase4> 00,02"*version was before struts were introduced*"
<Phase4> 00,02struts almost break the game
<MASF123> How much RAM does your computer have Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02MASF123, 16 GB "{
<Phase4> 00,02:P'
<MASF123> I on;y have 256MB....VERY LAGGY Lol
<Dumori> 256 ram
<Dumori> godz above that's Jarassic these days
<MASF123> yeah 256MBs of RAM
<cow334> would 4.00 gb ram be good to play garys mod and left four dead?
<MASF123> should be decent
<Dumori> plus it's like £40 for 4gb of DDR
<Dumori> 3
<Phase4> 00,02256 is really not enough for modern os'
<Phase4> 00,02os's
<Dumori> MASF123 you need a new rig chummer
<Dumori> 256 is tiny
<MASF123> no I mean 4 gbs
<MASF123> is decent
<cow334> and my processor is Intel core i3-213m CPU 2.10GHz 2.10GHz
<MASF123> not mine.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02rocket might be a bit heavy
<cow334> would that be able to play garys mod and left four dead
<Phase4> 00,02no, nvm
<Phase4> 00,02its all good
<Dumori> I have 6 gb of DDR3 in this, but my GPU is meh and my CPU in mid end
<Dumori> plus I'd really like more RAM
<Dumori> but this MB can only take 8GB tops
<thelonepony> space space
<cow334> where do you go to bye more ram
<cow334> like at ofice depot or something'
<Dumori> a place that sells PC parts
<Dumori> more a tech shop
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<cow334> office depot then
<MASF123> What is CPU and GPU I always wondered.
<thelonepony> Space core: i made it to space dad
<Dumori> or order online
<cow334> they sell a lot of computer stuff there
<Chrysalis> MASF123 Central and Graphics processing units
<Dumori> I doubt an office depo will stock componets though
<MASF123> Yeahb but what do each do?
<Dumori> process
<Chrysalis> as a unit
<MASF123> ...
<cow334> Dumori: so online would be the best place then
<Dumori> Maybe
<MASF123> Can I upgrade them?
*Chrysalis brohoofs Dumori
<Dumori> I don't know your nation or local area
<Chrysalis> MASF123 depends
<Chrysalis> are you on a mac
<MASF123> no Windows
<Chrysalis> then your fine, upgrade away
<Chrysalis> as long as the chip fits the MoBo
<Chrysalis> and the GPU doesnt overwhelm your PSU
<Dumori> And the bios likes it
<MASF123> And processors? What are those about?
<Dumori> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor
<cow334> Phase4: Space http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGo4eNFeIQo&list=UURZhlUwr0YARzVBTRoZGA_A&index=1&feature=plcp
<cow334> woot woot ^^
<Dumori> I can't explain processors with out being insanely indepth of so vage it's useless
<Dumori> X3
<Chrysalis> cow334 no vid links in stream
<cow334> Chrysalis: sorry
<Dumori> I balme my comp sci history there
<MASF123> Go for it, I just might pay attention if your lucky.
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, after music
<thegt90> lol that bunnymustard
<Chrysalis> MASF123 basically the cpu does all the game stuff
<Chrysalis> the gpu draws it to the screen
<MASF123> ok
<cow334> Phase4: okay
<Dumori> a CPU is the thing that dose all THE THINGS
<Chrysalis> most of the things
<MASF123> hmm...so the higher he number the better and faster is processeS?
<Dumori> no no
<Dumori> more or less ALL
<Chrysalis> things like physics are moving to the GPU now as well
<cow334> is a Intel core 13 good
<Chrysalis> theres even some AI routines built for GPUs
<Dumori> or dedicated PPUs
<Chrysalis> LAWL
<Dumori> but the CPU still passes them along
<Chrysalis> no one uses those any more
<Dumori> Chrysalis yeah they do
<Chrysalis> PhysX was a nice idea
<Dumori> just not in a desktop for home use
<Chrysalis> Dumori you do realise they actually are just graphics cards right?
<Chrysalis> but without texture lookup stuff
<Dumori> depends on how you define them
<Chrysalis> etc
<Dumori> not quite
<Chrysalis> massivly parrallel computation chips
<Phase4> 00,02rocket seems legit
<MASF123> So RAM is virtual memory...CPU handles all processes and GPU places it on the screen to watch. Sounds complicated.
<Chrysalis> MASF123 RAM is temporary memory
<Dumori> dude that's the simple and "wrong" version but yeah
<MASF123> Random Acess Memory
<Phase4> 00,02'virtual memory' refers to something else
<Phase4> 00,02ram is volatile
<MASF123> ... :(
<Chrysalis> virtual memory is a file on the harddrive to trick the computer into thinking it has more ram
<thegt90> http://funnyjunk.com/funny_gifs/4026930/uhuahuahua/
<Phase4> 00,02it requires the computer to be on to exist
<Phase4> 00,02ksp is lagging my pc hard
<Phase4> 00,02i think its going up
<Dumori> GPGPUs are the way forward though
<Dumori> plus you can just strap them together and make a PC
<Dumori> won't run any "real" OS
<MASF123> Wuut.
<Phase4> 00,02somehow i havent exploded
<Dumori> but I have a mate who has a BANK of nivida cards for cyrpto work
<Chrysalis> General Purpose Graphics Processing units
<Dumori> basicly
<Chrysalis> Dumori nice
<Dumori> it's a GPU that can do other math
<MASF123> So your won't have any software like WIndows running but the computer will still run?
<Phase4> 00,02operating systems generally depend on a 'mmu'
<Dumori> it also heats his flat
<Phase4> 00,02gpu's dont have it due to performance reason
<Phase4> 00,02plus the instruction sets on gpu's are tuned to the kind of work they do
<cow334> I am looking for more ram for my computer
<Chrysalis> Phase4 as is the silicon
<Phase4> 00,02altimiter gave uop
<Dumori> Phase I think he has a MB and a normal CP in there some place
<Phase4> 00,02up'
<Chrysalis> you try to bother the order of how it runs
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, not really afaik
<Dumori> but it's somethign like 6 500s
<Chrysalis> you will get into ALL sorts of issues
<MASF123> I would buy new things if I had a job...but they are so hard to get in this econmy
<Phase4> 00,02unless you meen the masks, silicon itself is the same stuff they use in desktop cpu's
<Phase4> 00,02this will insta explode when i stage
<Phase4> 00,02watch
<Chrysalis> i mean the way its all laid out
<Phase4> 00,02in a sec
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, well thats the mask
<Chrysalis> for examply using texture stuff in earlier shader stages will slow down the chip horrifically
<thegt90> http://funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/4027918/There+is+no+sugar+on+the+rape+cake/
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: turn the camera to the sky, that might increse the performance alittle
<MadSurge> Let's break the game :D
<MASF123> Who issues best Graphic Cards? Nvidia?
<Dumori> IMHO yeah just
<Chrysalis> MASF123 depends what you want it for
<Phase4> 00,02it'll speed up as i move away from the parts
<Dumori> but it's more or less level
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Dumori> with each having their quirks
<XAX> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/342/085/17c.jpg
<Chrysalis> yeah
<Dark_Horst> many seem to prefer nvidia cards for gaming though
<Dumori> but you only hav Nvida and ADM these days
<Chrysalis> NVIDIA chips are a PITA to code for
*Dumori glances longingly to his framed Voodo 3
<Dumori> (fist Graphics card I saved up for my self)
<Dumori> IIRC
<XAX> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/283/635/900.png
<Phase4> 00,02i broke the altimiter
<Chrysalis> Dumori i still got my old voodoo too
<MASF123> Do you take classes to know about computer things or do you research on your own time?
<Chrysalis> hell i still got my old p2
<Chrysalis> and i think i know where my old p1 is
<Phase4> 00,02i've got a dual cpu p2 board around here
<Dumori> I have my Dad's old ZX spectrum
<Phase4> 00,02cant get it to boot but its here

<tSparx> I really hope that at some point we get an epic Labyrinth 2-parter. Though I guess the Ssn2 premier stole the whole maze-thing's thunder
<Dumori> reason 12 Dumori never streams stuff
<tSparx> But, y'know, a 2-parter devoted to a Bowie-movie-reference
<Dumori> my tast in music is a "intresting"
<Phase4> 00,02there we go

<Dumori> accel?
<Dumori> :P
<Phase4> 00,02thats a good entry speed
<MASF123> well ok got to go
<Phase4> 00,02need to see how this works
<Dumori> 3KM/s-1 would be how many g
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02it works
<Phase4> 00,02new parachute design found

<cow334> what is wrong with your space sjip
<cow334> ....
<cow334> O-o
<Phase4> 00,02that was a re-entry
<tSparx> What am I watching? It looks very cool!
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, spaceships
<Dark_Horst> did you know that in fallout new vegas old world blues addon, if you have the wild wasteland perk, the trauma suits say "hey, who turned out the lights"?
<Dumori> Yep
<tSparx> Yay spaceships! Oh hey, I can see me on the screen. Hi Mom!
<Dumori> i knew
<Phase4> 00,02damned thing is climbing
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Serenity
<tSparx> is that ship heading anywhere in particular?
<Dark_Horst> wut?
<Serenity> Yes, I'm back again
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, its heading..... here
<Phase4> 00,02physics bug

<tSparx> Dumori: So you're piloting a massless spaceship around? Neat!
<Dumori> nope
<Dumori> I wasw going to work out the G 3KM/s^-1 would be

<Serenity> Anyway, Internet doesn't seem to be too fast, but at least I can talk to you guys ;)
<tSparx> Serenity: Happy-dappy internet-having!
<Serenity> Heh, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02i dont know how but this thing is pulling 15 g's
<Serenity> I have it until Thursday
<Dumori> X3
<Dumori> ouch
<Dumori> 15g
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, what connection are you on now?
<Dumori> poor piolts
<cow334> would this be worth the money or would it just be better to upgrade the computer you allready have http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/pd/Maingear-SHIFT-Super-Stock-X79/productID.247345300/categoryID.57613200/list.true
<Phase4> 00,02Dumori, should have seen what it did on re-entry
<Serenity> Phase4: I'm on a campsite connection in Scotland
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, www.microsoftstore.com << theres your problem
<Dumori> I don't think you ship is safe for organics
<Serenity> not sure if Saturn knows yet, but I'm coming for him >;3
<Buytoast> why is there a giant metal birdie hurtling through the sky?
<Phase4> 00,02proud of you microsoft
<Dumori> or most mecianical things stb
<Phase4> 00,02ohai SuperBrony64
<Phase4> 00,02Dumori, its not safe
<Phase4> 00,02infact it should have exploded
<Phase4> 00,02several times
<Phase4> 00,02it did explode once
<cow334> Phase4: O-o what but i thought microsoft was good
<Dumori> what was the G on reentry
<Dumori> ?
<Phase4> 00,02<<< look at stream
<Phase4> 00,02thats what their site shows
<Dumori> I can't
<Dark_Horst> cow334: ridiculosuly overpriced, if i ever saw it
<Phase4> 00,02"The request to this fragment failed. The request to this fragment failed. The request to this fragment failed. "
<Serenity> Phase4: What the hell?
<Dumori> my PC is busy eatting my bandwidth with other things
<Phase4> 00,02Dumori, i'll check what it was when the misson ends
<Dumori> plus I'm trying to "code"
<Kandarihu> That is one wierd rocket. And I'm seeing one sweet lighting system.
<Phase4> 00,02it records max g-force
<Dumori> to really loud eceltronic music that's mostly German
<Dumori> like that good old days
<Phase4> 00,0224.5G
<Dumori> horizontaly
<Dark_Horst> cow334: if you want that hardware, get the parts somehwere else. you could probabyl half the cost
<Dumori> ok thats death to any man
<Dumori> like eye poping brain hermerage death
<MegaMoonShine> Hi everypony :)
<MegaMoonShine> Damn, that rocket is huge
<Phase4> 00,02i've bugged the game out
<Serenity> UMG, U BRAEOK IT
<Phase4> 00,02Dumori, thats 'your face and your butt are now occupying the same space' level gforce
<Dumori> not quite
<Dumori> you can hold 17g in the right orientation for a while
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates August 21st (Morning)
<Serenity> Actually, that G at a constant rate should kill you
<Serenity> Quickly
<Dumori>  in a series of rocket sled deceleration experiments culminating in a late 1954 test in which he was clocked in a little over a second from a land speed of Mach 0.9. He survived a peak "eyeballs-out" force of 46.2 times the force of gravity, and more than 25 g for 1.1 sec, proving that the human body is capable of this. Stapp lived another 45 years to age 89, but suffered lifelong damage to his vision from this last te
<Dumori> in fact 25g is survile able
<Dumori> it has been survied
<Dumori> but I doubt it was only a small peak
<Dark_Horst> i think the highest g-force bearable over periods of time is somehwere at 10? with 9 being the safety-limit for combat pilots?
<cow334> I 'm gonna get a computer from dell instead
<Serenity> It's 10, yes
<cow334> im tired of microst
<Dark_Horst> Dumori: only in impuklse form though
<Dumori> 10 is the black out range for most humans IIRC
<Dumori> but 12 for a minuet shoudl be no lasting damage for most healthy people
<Dumori> the rest depends on orientation
<Serenity> I haven't really experienced, but the most G I've done is around 4 in a car corning at 70 mph
<Dumori> and it's effect on blood flow
<Serenity> 3*
<Serenity> :/
<Dumori> I've hit 5-6 once IIRC
<Dark_Horst> Dumori: not healthy people, trained people
<cow334> oh yeah Phase4 would you want a man co box for your sandman or a ambassador
<Dumori> no no healthy just horizontally
<Dumori> not vertically
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, a what now?
<Dark_Horst> what's that song called anyway?
<Dumori> vertically blood presure across th body goes funky
<cow334> Phase4: from teamfortress
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, " Alex S. (feat. Ghost) - Melting Pot of Alcohol "
<Dumori> horizontally it's much more constant across th ebody
<Jmo> A crate Phase4
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: thanks
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo, i was wondering
<Serenity> Phase4: One of those crates you open with a key
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, no
<Jmo> o.o
<Phase4> 00,02i've got lots of crates already :(
<Serenity> I sold my HHHH for 3 keys :3
<Phase4> 00,02no one wants them
<Serenity> ^ You'll be amazed
<cow334> Phase4: oh what would you want for it i dont know any thing about stuff I have
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, if you have someone who wants crates i've got a bunch
<Dark_Horst> i have crates. anybody wanna?
<Phase4> 00,0215 or 20
<cow334> i have a lot of creates
<Serenity> Phase4: About 70% of the trade server population wants crates
<Hat> Tf2?
<Dumori> horizontally provised your facing the right way due to eyes 17g in tolearble for the untrained
<Dumori> 12 if faceing the other way
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, i think they want keys
<Serenity> Nope, crates
<Phase4> 00,02if you want the crates you can have
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: where can i find this trade sevrer?
<Hat> Does bronystate have a trade server
<cow334> what is your favorite class on team fortress Phase4
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: There's loads
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, no real favorite
<Phase4> 00,02kinda flip betwene soilder, engi and... i forget the last one
<Serenity> Mine's the Soldier and Snaipah
<Chrysalis> if you have a favourite class on tf2
<Phase4> 00,02soldier'
<Chrysalis> your not really playing it right
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Dark_Horst> heavy. brass beast. nuff said
<cow334> oh... hmm well would you want a sharpen volcano fragment from pyro
<Dumori> fav has to by pyro or demoknigt
<Dumori> best likly sane demo or engi
<thegt90> night yall
<cow334> night thegt90
<Dumori> I'm not a bad sniper at time
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Actually, that's kinda false, since everyone can play all classes, but simply prefer one out of them all
<Hat> Scout has mad milk
<Buytoast> why wouldn't you choose your class depending on the make up of your team in order to maximize cahnces of success?
<Buytoast> that's just shameful
<Dark_Horst> well i dont have that much of a favourite class. but i knwo what my least favourite class os
<tSparx> Buytoast: I think Serenity's saying that you can do both.
<Chrysalis> its the one thing that bugs me about MvM
<Chrysalis> after a couple rounds
<Dumori> Buytoast cause I know if I go spy I might as well shot the spawn wall
<tSparx> Have a fav but still play what's needed
<Chrysalis> your locked into your clas
<Chrysalis> or you waste too many fund
<Serenity> Yeah, in MvM, we have like 4 snipers
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, i know the feel
<Chrysalis> class * funds*
<Dark_Horst> sniper. i'm so used to have bullet, travveling time, downpull and "normal" moving targets that i just cant play the tf sniper
<Phase4> 00,02you know whats really fun?
<Hat> Spy in mvm lol
<Phase4> 00,02going all engie
<Phase4> 00,02and winning
<XylemTube> Is Sumica streaming right now?
<Chrysalis> you know what
<Phase4> 00,02feels so broken
<Dumori> Dark_Horst hehe
<Chrysalis> who wants to do just that
<Phase4> 00,02XylemTube, nope
<Serenity> ^ Pah, weakling
<Chrysalis> all engie MVM
<Buytoast> if you're a demoman in mvm you're unstoppable
<Buytoast> unless your doing advanced
<Dumori> play the tf sniper like any other hitscan
<tSparx> Welcome nameless pony!
<cow334> On man vs machine when I cant win I use engin and set up turents every where
<Phase4> 00,02all engie mvm? i'm up for it
<Dumori> don't thing you're sniping
<cow334> Woot woot ^^
<Serenity> I rape advanced difficulty with Soldier ;)
<Phase4> 00,02want to launch this rocket first
<Hat> Sentry buster rush
<Serenity> Sentry busters are so easy to kill
<cow334> Phase4: I'll go for it]
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, i'm planing on a mun run, so this will take a while
<tSparx> I wanna watch the rocket!
<Buytoast> i suppose i could try an all enig match
<Dumori> widowmaker is NASTY on MvM
<Serenity> Idon't get why everyone's like OMG SENTRY BUSTUH
<Phase4> 00,02assuming it doesnt explode mid way
<Phase4> 00,02Dumori, ikr!
<Buytoast> because people are fools Serenity
<Phase4> 00,02penetrating shots + field of heavys = DOOMED HEAVYS
<Serenity> Phase4: Pack up your sentry, run to it, wait to arm, run away
<Chrysalis> Serenity large AoE
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: all engi mvm is fun... until an all sentry buster wave runs in
<Dumori> penitartion, speed, no reloand and 100 hp on kill
<Buytoast> they'll spend the whole round running away from a buster
<Buytoast> rather than let it boom n miss
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Since it comes to you, easily avoidable ;)
<Phase4> 00,02woah lag
<Serenity> I love griefing with the Sentry buster
<Serenity> One was chasing me, so I went to 2 other engies and let it explode their stuff
<Chrysalis> remind me never to play with Serenity
<Buytoast> ahahaha
<Buytoast> oh god
<Buytoast> that's beautiful
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Don't worry, as long as you don't annoy me, I can play quite peacefully
<Phase4> 00,02rocket is normally less stable than this
<Buytoast> griefing is always fun
<Phase4> 00,02lag is making it more stable
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, XD
<Phase4> 00,02running from a sentry buster is always fun
<Phase4> 00,02they bug out soo hard on doors
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, you know mannworks?
<tSparx> 6sec lag heehee
<Serenity> Course I do
<Serenity> Done it like 5 times
<Dumori> I just run past a hole on coal and let the pyro fix them
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, know the brown building?
<Phase4> 00,02with stairs on the side?
<Serenity> Yeah, the one in the middle?
<Phase4> 00,02you can get a sentry up there
<Chrysalis> huh
<Chrysalis> theres a near completion on this server
<tSparx> Where do I recognize that pig noise from?
<Phase4> 00,02if all sentrys are up there, and a sentry buster spawns
<tSparx> Oooh, that's the beginning to Animals
<Phase4> 00,02it insta explodes off the map
<tSparx> Er, Pigs
<Serenity> Lolwut
<tSparx> off Animals
<Gold_Demona> Good morning, Bronystate
<Serenity> That's...silly
<cow334> morning Gold_Demona
<Jmo> Hey Gold_Demona :3
<MegaMoonShine> Good morning, Gold_Demona :)
*Dumori wants to play MvM now...
<Serenity> Well, I would play TF2
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: u here?
<Serenity> But my Internet avalible isn't really good enough
<Serenity> And my laptop isn't here
<Serenity> Still needs fixing. And El shitbox is still at home, which still can't run it anyway
<Gold_Demona> Dat intermittent music
<Phase4> 00,02not sure why thats happening
<Serenity> Phase4: Aliens
<cow334> Deadspace pretty much
<tSparx> This band just really hates interrupting noises in space that we shouldn't be able to hear.
<Gold_Demona> I'll bet it's your little astronaut dude. He keeps hitting pause to make sure nothing's wrong. =P
<tSparx> I just realized that dragon called Luna tacky! OH NO YOU DIDN'T!
<Dark_Horst> you lost soemthing
<Vordox> Want some space/Comfy music, Phase4 ? =3
<Phase4> 00,02my rocket broke
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, yeah
<Serenity> Phase4: No shit
<Phase4> 00,02heard all these songs many times
<Vordox> It's Atmospheric Music
<Serenity> Think we all say around 70 pieces come off :3
<Phase4> 00,02MIGHT be able to land this thing
<Phase4> 00,02but its not easy
<Serenity> Now brb, because I'm hungry
<Phase4> 00,02need a bigger rocket
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: to glory from two steps from hell works good with starting rockets
<cow334> Phase4: EXPLODE you wont do it you wont you wont do it you eont
<Vordox> Best JRPG i've played <3 Star Ocean 2, nothing have beaten it yet
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, not enough power for the mun
<tSparx> Phase4: Can you break orbit and just send it aimlessly floating?
<twilight_sprinkle> and thus ends my summer. ima go to bed now, cyall
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, i can, not with this rocket though
<cow334> night twilight_sprinkle
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: Night!
<MegaMoonShine> Bye twilight_sprinkle :)
<Gold_Demona> Night twilight_sprinkle
<tSparx> Enjoy school
<Vordox> <3 This music. so goooood.
<Vordox> What are you aiming to do, Phase4 ? =/
<Phase4> 00,02re-enter
<Jokoba> It's 5:55am. I have school tomorrow.
<Phase4> 00,02i wanted to reach the mun but that failed
<Phase4> 00,02after this might try for all-engie mvm
<Vordox> Just let it drop then? :P
<Jokoba> Well... today.
<Vordox> I'm up for that, Phase4 .^^
<cow334> Phase4: Never give up
<tSparx> Well, gratz, I think you've signed up for no sleep.
<cow334> I'll play mvm all egin
<tSparx> Phase4: YOUR ROCKET IS THE ROCKET THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS... or at least the atmosphere
<cow334> woot woot ^^
<Vordox> What you think of the music, Phase4 ? =3
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, its not really my kind of thing
<Phase4> 00,02but could work in a game
<Vordox> Phase4: Hmmm... More spacey you want?
<Phase4> 00,02space jrpg i assume
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Vordox> It's middle, Space and Old World
<Phase4> 00,02lets just let it re-enter for now
<cow334> what about this Phase4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHyHK0fqIrA
<Serenity> Halo doesn't really mix with kerbals getting exploded and murdered
<Vordox> cow334: No links in main chat unless permission
<Vordox> Oh I see Serenity :D
<cow334> sorry Vordox
<cow334> Serenity: lol
<Vordox> Serenity: Benny Hill Theme
<Serenity> No. overused
<Vordox> Bumblebee
<tSparx> TTGL OST
<Vordox> OH GOD
<Phase4> 00,02very calm re-entry
<Gold_Demona> The DDR "Bumblebee" or the classical "Flight of the Bumblebee"?
<Vordox> Phase4!
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, ?
<Buytoast> just play some Spanish Flea
<Chrysalis> oh god
<tSparx> Whee!
<Chrysalis> there are some photos of me with god aweful face expressions
<Chrysalis> from buck
<Vordox> Theme song for Kerbals.
<MegaMoonShine> Oh god...
<tSparx> ooh, my favy!
<Serenity> Yes
<cow334> Awww yeah
<Serenity> Just. Yes
<Vordox> Imagine kerbals space program with this song
<Phase4> 00,02first thing i've ever made capable of controled descent
<Vordox> So horrible yet so...
<MegaMoonShine> "And let's not forget the Turbodrive!"
<Vordox> Phase4: It... still never left gravity :P
<Phase4> 00,02theres the instability
<Serenity> Love how the SAS (is it?) is going batshit crazy to control the ship
<Buytoast> wow that's shaking more than an eskimo with parkinsons
<Gold_Demona> Lol, it looks like the rocket is dancing to the music. XD
<MegaMoonShine> lol
<tSparx> Tiny Tim <3
<cow334> woot woot
<MegaMoonShine> Altimeter is broken?
<Buytoast> that space corn must be shitting his pants
<MegaMoonShine> Looks like it's not actually falling anywhere
<tSparx> How many g's is the pilot experiencing just from the rotation, I wonder.
<Phase4> 00,02i'm staying in the one spot
<Phase4> 00,02this is getting us nowhere
<Gold_Demona> lol
<tSparx> Haha
<Buytoast> blow him up
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: nose down, rocket on, BEAT THE SYSEM!
<Buytoast> he knew the risks
<tSparx> Do you have a rocket still attached to your ship?
<Phase4> 00,02parachute is all wierd
<tSparx> Or can you get it to straighten out for a moment?
<Phase4> 00,02i think thats actually the direction we're moving
<Phase4> 00,02also i think we are gaining altitude
<tSparx> How is that even, I mean, is your spaceship just super-light or something? It seems like its terminal velocity would still be REALLY FAST DOWNWARD
<Phase4> 00,02using the rocket for a vapor trail
<Dark_Horst> tSparx: physics in this game get all wonky with certain designs
<cow334> lol
<Gold_Demona> lol, This seems oddly fitting. XD
<Vordox> That very unfitting music...
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: that very fitting music
<MegaMoonShine> This is actually kinda fitting in a strange way
<Kandarihu> Is it just me or is the altimeter broken?
<Vordox> I think Phase4 is just grinning :P
<tSparx> lol
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, :3
<Vordox> It's Rocket Ballet he's probably doing right now :D
<MegaMoonShine> He broke physics
<Kandarihu> This music is going to be fitting for a few seconds.
<Phase4> 00,02eventually this thing will land
<Vordox> "Eventually"
<Gold_Demona> Maybe
<Phase4> 00,02aeiou
<cow334> lol who ever picked the mario brothers music is awesome this gose perfect with this
<Gold_Demona> I think they forgot how to gravity
<cow334> Woot woot ^^
<Vordox> Can't you make it become still?
<Buytoast> i still say you should blow it up
<MegaMoonShine> Snake! Snake! SNAAAAAAAKE!
<Kandarihu> It almost looks like it IS falling, but the camera angle is changing to obscure it.
<Vordox> Phase4: Isn't it spinning faster and faster?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm honestly not sure what its doung
<Vordox> And now it's gaining attitude
<Vordox> :D
<Gold_Demona> Are you sure you haven't escaped the planet's gravity and returned to the planet just to taunt it's gravity? =P
<Phase4> 00,02the parachute's angle looks soo strange
<MegaMoonShine> Turn off the engine phase
<cow334> what is up with that ship...
<cow334> lol]
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, that would explain a lot
<Phase4> 00,02MegaMoonShine, its on VERY low
<Phase4> 00,02just to generate a trail so i have some refference
<Phase4> 00,02plus the engine itself is like farting
<cow334> mai Space ship gose soi soi soi soi soi
<Phase4> 00,02doesnt move much
<Vordox> most annoying built ship ever =P
<Vordox> OH I KNOW
<Vordox> Phase4: !
<tSparx> Well, if you keep accelerating the rotation of the ship, eventually internal stress will solve your landing problem.
<tSparx> !
<Vordox> We HAVE PARACHUTE
<Vordox> Also, dat Star man theme XD
<Gold_Demona> Kinda...
<MegaMoonShine> Woop
<tSparx> It'll provide enough drag to straighten it out.
<Gold_Demona> lol!
<MegaMoonShine> lol
<Phase4> 00,02soo much music request
<Phase4> 00,02also the parachute broke
<Vordox> HOW DID IT BREAK!?
<Phase4> 00,02right now i'm straight up hovering
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, bug
<Vordox> You were like super slow as hell
<Buytoast> it'll never end
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02as i said
<Phase4> 00,02bug
<tSparx> Hello, nameless pony!
<Gold_Demona> Wow...
<Vordox> Aww,just a few minute too late for "Spin me right round baby"
<Vordox> XD
<Vordox> Would have done it faster, bleh
<Vordox> Not exactly spinning there Phase4 :D
<Vordox> Can't you break off the wings somehow?
<Buytoast> alright now it's just fucking with you
<Phase4> 00,02cant spin
<tSparx> Phase4: Can't you just fire your rocket at this point?
<Phase4> 00,02the damned thing is stable
<Gold_Demona> Yup. I knew it. You're just taunting gravity.
<tSparx> Oh no wait, you're facing up
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, i could
<Vordox> Phase4: Never build anything stupid like this again? XD
<Phase4> 00,02i could detatch and fall
<Phase4> 00,02but that would kill...
<Phase4> 00,02'Edbin'
<Vordox> Oh no, poor "Named" Kerbals
<Vordox> I think ths song would be AweSOME for a kerbal montage
<Vordox> :D
<Vordox> What's the name of this ship, Phase4 ? Dandelion?
<Phase4> 00,02real problem is i broke the altimiter
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, 'Pinkie Pie'
<Vordox> ....Makes sense
<tSparx> BWAHAHAHA YES
<Buytoast> i still say it should be the S.S. Fuckitall
<Gold_Demona> LOL That explains everything!
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma go get some food
<Kandarihu> Well, maybe he'll live.
<tSparx> Nah, that way when its tail wiggles you know there's a meteor show
<tSparx> shower*
<Vordox> Phase4: Starting up TF2 while you do that
<Dark_Horst> halo OST?
<cow334> woot woot halo 2
<Chrysalis> oh crap
<tSparx> This isn't the Halo 2 theme -- this is the original theme, and I love it!
<Chrysalis> MLP stuff is actually gettin to the UK now
<Chrysalis> my poor bank account
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: you lucky bastards
<tSparx> Or maybe it's not, idk. But I love the not-mjolnir-mix versions of this theme.
<cow334> Vordox: can you add me on steam
<Dark_Horst> germany is a fim-merch wasteland
<Chrysalis> the uk is usually
<Chrysalis> but there seems to be a big blindbag wave comin
<Chrysalis> and then the t-shirts that are out soon
<Vordox> cow334: I don't even know you
<tSparx> Dark_Horst: I'll trade you FIM-merch for German auto engineering. Send a Veyron my way if I help you complete your collector's set? :P
<cow334> Vordox: Just asking you don't have to if you dont want to
<Thunder-Crescent> howdy bronies
<tSparx> Howdy!
<cow334> hello Thunder-Crescent
<MegaMoonShine> howdy Thunder-Crescent :)
<Buytoast> did anyone else hear some pirate just now?
<Vordox> cow334: Meh fine :P
<Vordox> Just add me
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah
<Vordox> TheRealVordox
<tSparx> No that was phase's Avast
<XAX> Chrysalis: >2012 >still nothing much at all related to MLP in New Zealand
<cow334> Vordox: I cant
<Vordox> cow334: ?
<cow334> Vordox: I have to purchase something first
<Vordox> cow334: Ooookay?
<cow334> No for real
<Dark_Horst> tSparx: had you asked me a few months ago i could've sold you a golf4 in varying states of repair :P
<cow334> Vordox: My name is cow224
<tSparx> Dark_Horst: xD
<Dark_Horst> hey, it's still volkswagen
<tSparx> Couldn't even offer a Pheiton (sp), no
<tSparx> haha
<cow334> woot woot
<tSparx> XAX, I'm gonna have to ask you stay still xD
<Gold_Demona> Edbin's probably ready to take a nap by now.
<XAX> tSparx: Cant help it ;~;
<cow334> Phase4: How come you havent fallen yet
<tSparx> I figured, just teasing xP~
<cow334> Your ship looks like it is just still
<tSparx> cow334: it is
<tSparx> cow334: he built a ship that makes the game ignore physics. This is the result.
<Gold_Demona> cow334: The ship forgot how to gravity
<tSparx> Basically
<cow334> tSparx: wwhhaaatt Gold_Demona is that even possible
<tSparx> cow334: Sure, in a video game ;)
<Gold_Demona> cow334: It is when your ship is named "Pinkie Pie. =P
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, physics got bored
<cow334> lol
<tSparx> ^^das^^
<cow334> Wait then dose that mean it's just going to stay like that
<Gold_Demona> ForEEEVVVEEEERRRRRRR~
<Dumori> phase4 I built a ship powered by flaps and ASS
<MegaMoonShine> Dramatic music is dramatic
<Dumori> you "trun" a few times then asa kicks in a spazzy the flapps like a mad man
<Gold_Demona> How about a ship powered by love and friendship?
<Dumori> and suddenly free power
<Phase4> 00,02Dumori, is it a 0.16 craft?
<Serenity> Oh
<Dumori> .`5
<Phase4> 00,02i found one for 0.15 on the fourms
<Serenity> That. Fucking. Boss. The improsoned
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Dumori> .15
<Dumori> it might still work in .16
<Dumori> not tryed
<Phase4> 00,02its not falling
<Buytoast> The Legend of Groose
<Phase4> 00,02Dumori, nah, they changed some of the core stuff
<Phase4> 00,02this craft is hovering
<Dumori> I know but I've nto tryed
<Phase4> 00,02as in its not losing altitude
<Dumori> so it might still work
<Phase4> 00,02average altitude anyway
<Phase4> 00,02and its gaining speed
<Dumori> cos it's actually producing thrust from flapping
<Phase4> 00,02Dumori, thats just it
<Phase4> 00,02it isnt
<Dumori> it's a orhocopter
<Phase4> 00,02sas is of
<Phase4> 00,02off'
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not touching any controlls
<Dumori> no my plane that uses sas to fly
<cow334> well phases ship broke physics
<cow334> ...
<cow334> ossim possim
<Vordox> It's SO CLOSE
<Vordox> Or is it?
<Vordox> LAWL
<MegaMoonShine> lol
<Vordox> FECK YOUR PHYSICS
<tSparx> No, no it's not
<Vordox> Awww....
<MegaMoonShine> Ded
<Vordox> He lived, ish
<cow334> NNNNOOOO
<Buytoast> abort
<Gold_Demona> R.I.P. Edbin. :<
<Phase4> 00,02sooo
<Phase4> 00,02two plans
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, he broke the laws of physics
<Phase4> 00,02the punishment for which is death
<Gold_Demona> lol
<tSparx> xD
<Gold_Demona> Only Pinkie Pie may legally break physics
<cow334> they should give them a reward for doing that not death
<Phase4> 00,02pinkie pie is not legally alowed
<Phase4> 00,02they've just never managed to catch her
<Gold_Demona> lol
<tSparx> ^^das^^
<Phase4> 00,02now
<Phase4> 00,02two plans
<Phase4> 00,02a: all engie MvM

<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, i opened a bunch of crates, two of them were balloonicorns
<Phase4> 00,02kept one, gifted the other
<tSparx> OHHHH you were not talking about actually crates earlier, haha
<Serenity> Phase4: Son of a bitch, I got freaking strange weapons, no hats
<tSparx> When I joined back in, I was wondering why you were going to ship Serenity a bunch of crates.
<Buytoast> which server is this?
<Serenity> Well, I'm all outta keys, I only had 3
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: which series is that?
<Serenity> But I can do some more conning for keys

<Dumori> Serenity shoudl I tell you the specs of my old PC that I played pro on

<Dumori> nvid 5200LE
<Dumori> ADM 2200+
<Serenity> in 1 sentence
<Dumori> 512mb ram ddr2
<Jmo> LOL
<d3rb> lol
<Serenity> I knew it :P
<d3rb> should have done it in a single sentence
<Serenity> Also, that's still better than shitbox
<Jmo> Bahahaha
*Dumori shugs
<Dumori> it don matter I have an alt on here
<Serenity> Dumori: Those specs are still better than Shitboxe's
<Dumori> hehehe

<Dumori> I kicked but
<d3rb> does shitbox have a rat in a spining wheel for a pwer supply or something?
<Dumori> on severs in Aus

<Dumori> hehehe
<Dumori> yeah

<Serenity> Not DDR2, not DDR3, but DDR
<Dumori> I got my 2200+ to 2.4gz
<Dumori> cos overclocking king
<Dumori> fyi that ram might just be DDR
<Serenity> Overclocking on my machine would probably set it on fire :S
<Dumori> I'm unsure
<d3rb> yit will be ddr1 no doubt
<d3rb> sd at worst though :D
<Serenity> Guys, did you know
<Serenity> That my 512 MB of RAM is DDR

<Gold_Demona> Hi Malavolent
<Da> Malavolent: hai
<alexxm> how you doing Malavolent
<Malavolent> alexxm: As usual, it would be great here if it weren't so freaking hot.
<Phase4> 00,02when your laggign a fairly powerfull machine with ksp your doing it right
<Malavolent> I really don't bear hot weather well.
<Da> its working :P
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: you sound like my husband. =/
<Da> :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: how have you been instead?
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Don't lie, girls don't watch MLP.
<PsychoticDoc> Malavolent: he/she never said he/she was a girl
<Da> :O
<Phase4> 00,02i blame discord
<Malavolent> PsychoticDoc: It was either homosexual or girl. I tried the latter.
<PsychoticDoc> I dont think it really matters
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: everyone at BUCK said it was so friggin' hot, but I thought it was perfectly warm! Maybe it's me, it gets really hot around here in summer :D
<Da> im new so, whats BUCK?
<d3rb> a convention
<Da> oh ok, thanks
<Malavolent> Well it's never really hot in UK
<d3rb> a brony one specifically
<PsychoticDoc> Hot weather complainging is fo chumps, im stuck in 80% humidity for the most part of my life
<MadSurge> ^
<Malavolent> I like humidity.
<Malavolent> I should move to UK.
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's acclamitsing that's the issue
<Malavolent> But then again, there are weird people.
<PsychoticDoc> I dont, unecissary sweating just aint all dat cool
<Dumorimasoddaa> The uk is X for so long
<Chrysalis> MadSurge it was absolutely roasting in the party
<Dumorimasoddaa> That our yearly hot month is a shock if it's actually hot
<Chrysalis> Da BUCK is the brony uk convention
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: yeah, with that I agree
<Chrysalis> organised by our one and only Saturn
<Da> oh :3
<Chrysalis> and was held this weekend
<Phase4> 00,02oh god the lag
<Phase4> 00,02soo much lag
<Phase4> 00,02even when i try to make it faster
<Da> im in OR :/
<PsychoticDoc> kill that thing with its performance and whatnots
<Phase4> 00,02i have to throttle down a smidge
<Phase4> 00,02problem is the frame rate is soo low, i cant
<Phase4> 00,02the slightest tap sends it to half throttle
<Malavolent> Everytime you launch the shuttle - photoalbum.
<Phase4> 00,02well here goes nothing
<PsychoticDoc> come on phase4! You got dis!
<Da> i wonder if there are secret haters here just waiting to strike :O
<cowvarkian> probably
<Phase4> 00,02i need Less lag
<PsychoticDoc> Da: its very unlikely
<Malavolent> Da: Haven't seen any haters here since I've joined.
<Da> but possible?
<d3rb> what kind of a beast is needed to run this smoothly?

<EpicCookieTime> The party cannons are MINE >:D

<killerpony7733> Saturn I know you heard the suggestion, But the possibility of a bronystate panel for any bronystaters at next years B.U.C.K could be possible?

<Chrysalis> no major delays which is what i was expecting
<Chrysalis> a couple of no-shows but they were outside of control
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Well i just thought from what i could gather that everyone that got up on the stage there wasn't really prepared or anything like that
<killerpony7733> It was a bit random
<Chrysalis> oh no, not at all
<Chrysalis> still rather fun

<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Quiet: there was also a blonde girl with a full Fluttershy fursuit :3
<Jim> Make sure you don't fall in the ocean
<Da> land without a parachute? IMPOSIBRU
<HiImSpike> that suiccccide... Kidz GL
<Phase4> 00,02nut its all the way over there
<Phase4> 00,02but'
<Phase4> 00,02and i'm going this way already
<Gold_Demona> At least it's not hovering this time
<Dark_Horst> did your diretion somehow change?
<Ninjazz|Quiet> MadSurge, Hmmm. A little interested.
<Sylandest> yesh
<Jim> It's going slow down
<HiImSpike> I think gravity is broken
<Sylandest> more zelda
<Jim> so it's looking good
<sonicandmario85> Serenity:if you think flu shots are good for you there not AND you dont need them because the germs make you sick its not because you dont have a flu shot and i havent got sick in like what? 2 years?
<HiImSpike> or is it just me
<Jim> This is looking promising
<Gold_Demona> This music is awesome. =D
<Serenity> sonicandmario85: That wasn't my message at all. I said you should have a good immune system
<killerpony7733> ^
<Phase4> 00,02damned things gliding too well
<Ninjazz|Quiet> Dummeh is so good at these.
<sonicandmario85> Serenity:i already do i had a flu shot when i was a baby but it wasnt one that wasnt good for you but it was a healthy one
<killerpony7733> You need to get outside and all and avoid being in sterile enviroments cause if you do, Your chances of getting deadly ill or just badly is high
<Gold_Demona> dat non-aerodynamic gliding
<Jim> DAH DAH DA DAAA
<Boltasar> HAY GUURLZZ
<Gold_Demona> YOU GOT A THIIIIIIING~
<cow334> Phase4: try this on next http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rLLVDck4xE&list=PLAE1C556AFD532944&index=60&feature=plpp_video if you want to
<sonicandmario85> MARIO
<Gold_Demona> So much awesome music. =D
<Serenity> killerpony7733: My immune system is really good, but colda really really get me
<Da> do do od od odo dodo od o
<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Quiet: http://i.imgur.com/gQsXe.jpg sideways -__- these aren't mine anyways
<cow334> woot woot ^^
<Jim> Oh great, now it will rain
<MadSurge> Slowest descent ever :D
<Serenity> Oh look. it's pissing it down
<killerpony7733> Serenity: Yep same, I in the run of a year get sick less then 10 times with the time very largely spread inbetween
<Serenity> No seriously. it's raining
<Jim> I think he accidentaly broke gravity, MadSurge
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: the purpose of flu-shots is to keep your immune system up to date. antibodies always configure to most frequent and recent threats. flu-shots are basically practice runs for them
<HiImSpike> No wonder this thing blows up easily its made of some sort of cardboard and alot of fuel its glidding like a butter through knife
<MadSurge> Jim: :D
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Exactly and vaccines or that helps quickly building immunity towards certain things
<cow334> Phase4: what you think about these songs
<sonicandmario85> Dark_Horst:god didnt give us flu shots when us humans were made WE DONT NEED THEM
<Ninjazz|Quiet> MadSurge, Hmmm. Can't get into it. :$
<Serenity> sonicandmario85: Other than the life expecancy being < 30
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, when they say 'synthetic orchestra' they meen it, it lacks the blending you get in natural sound
<Phase4> 00,02BUT
<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Quiet: a little creepy but also cute :D
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: it's a simulated flu infection with deativated virus cells so that your immune system canr eact if thereÄs a real flu virus in your bloodstream
<Phase4> 00,02it is very well done
<Phase4> 00,02not fair to compair synthetic stuff to real, cant really record an orchestra propperly
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: yes, god didnt give us flu shots, which is why people died of flu all the time before modern emdicine
<Serenity> You can't ever get immune to Flu, since there's more than 150 different types at once
<Gold_Demona> sonicandmaario85: God didn't give us shots for anything. Which is why he gave us the ability to make medicine. =/
<Ninjazz|Quiet> MadSurge, creepy yes... Cute?... Well, perhaps if he or she was a bit shorter. :$
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, what if you caught all 150?
<Serenity> Phase4: Say your prayers, dude
<cow334> Phase4: thanks woot woot ^^ would you want to hear more
<Jim> Phase4, Gotta catch 'em all.
<sonicandmario85> Dark_Horst:i havent taken any flu shots and it seems my bodys doing pretty fine
<cow334> your choice
<Boltasar> phase, then you are a pokemon master
<Phase4> 00,02Boltasar, XD
<Boltasar> although, there are 101
<Boltasar> 151*
<Ninjazz|Quiet> Gotta catch 'em all!
<killerpony7733> Serenity: You techinally have a near immunity to it, But some things can adapt and change quickly surprising your immune system not being able to know if that's it or not
<Ninjazz|Quiet> *cough sneeze choke*
<Serenity> I'm talking about viruses, not fookin' pokkymans
<Phase4> 00,02i know far too much abotu the original pokemon games
<Phase4> 00,02though mostly tech details
<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Quiet: http://i.imgur.com/YKD2X.jpg faraway pic of the girl without the 'Shy head
<Phase4> 00,02i like how i'm not piloting this rocket
<Phase4> 00,02its just gliding
<Gold_Demona> Why are we arguing about flu shots?
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: May i ask. Do you spend your time away from people and usually only being indoors?
<Phase4> 00,02and its a rocket
<Boltasar> Phase4: I know too much too, like several ways to do the missingo glitch, AND I NEVER PLAYED THE GAMM...
<Jim> mah, the rocket is descending so slowly that I thought my stream froze for a moment
<Boltasar> GAME*
<Sylandest> Phase4 is best rocket glider
<sonicandmario85> killerpony7733:yes
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: that good either mean that you have a strong immune system or didnt get in contact enough with flu. the latter would that if you get infected with it, the next one'S gonna be a nasty fucker
<HiImSpike> whos here from Melbourne Australia... Wondering
<Dark_Horst> *could mean
<cow334> Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnCNCqaPr-g&list=PLAE1C556AFD532944&index=66&feature=plpp_video
<Serenity> Nope, I'm Lincs, England
<Da> i actually fogot this was bronystate XD
<Phase4> 00,02Boltasar, i've played all three (red, blue, yellow) and have performed both the misingno glitch as well as the working mew glitch
<cow334> Phase4: I know its not real orchestra but it stil sounds very nice
<Phase4> 00,02i have a pokemon blue cartridge with two mew's on it
<sonicandmario85> germs make you sick not the planet
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, they do sound nice
<Serenity> Most bacteria is useful
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: Well bad news. You are techinally in a sterile enviroment and having never taken flu shots or anything- You are highly and i caps it HIGHLY in danger of getting sick very quickly if when you begin to having to go out and be near people
<Boltasar> Phase4: but green exists, in japan...
<cow334> Phase4: yup
<Phase4> 00,02Boltasar, havent played it because japanese
<Jim> OMG Donkey Kong Country was my childhood!
<Boltasar> DKC IS BEST GAME EVER

<Ninjazz|Quiet> Dummeh, y u brilliant?
<Phase4> 00,02wasnt untill 3rd gen that the games had any reall differences, and even then they were mostly meeningless
<Jim> Serenity, Never had a N&4
<sonicandmario85> killerpony7733:and you can make yourself sick by thinking you are yes the human minds that strong
<Jim> N64*
<MadSurge> Donkey Kong Country <3
<Phase4> 00,02bad guys wore blue instead of red kinda things
<Serenity> Jim: WHAT? Deeeewwweeed. Buy one
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: Well that's what it does. But i'm talking long term health and ability to do things around people
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: somethig entirely else
<Serenity> I bet you could get an N64 for 30 euros
<Phase4> 00,02almost there
<Gold_Demona> Why are we still arguing over sickness?
<sub06905> Goldeneye 64 <3
<Da> i have a cold :l
<Serenity> Banjo Tooie :3
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: One is mind power and fooling yourself, The other is a actual threat to your body

<MaxTheBrony> Heya Gold_Demona and MegaMoonShine :)
<HiImSpike> hey MaxTheBrony
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: Still not a healthy way to go, Your body becomes more unstimulated and practiced with every day germs and bacteria and it gets weaker.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya HiImSpike :)
<cow334> hello HiImSpike
<sonicandmario85> sometimes i just go outside and sit out there or i chase the chicken around the yard XD
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: Cause you will have to go out one day and spend time around people.
<Boltasar> Phase4: this stream needs more forest interlude, life in the mines or stickerbrush symphony
<HiImSpike> cow334: MaxTheBrony /)
<Da> phase4 make a small ship
<MaxTheBrony> HiImSpike: (\
<cow334> HiImSpike: woot woot /)

<Ninjazz|Quiet> Sylandest, Rocketship.mp4
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Quiet: eeeyup
<BronyInstrumental> i was bored of minecraft by about a week, i don't get what's so entertaining about it :/
<MegaMoonShine> Sad music before they all die horribly
<sonicandmario85> this cant end well
<sonicandmario85> nvm
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: here'S the thing with preemptive vaccines and antibiotics: vaccines are injections mainly with nonfunctional virus cells so that your anibodies get a genetic blueprint of what they have to defend against. flu shots reinforce your immune system. if you've been sick and took medicine, you've probabyl taken antibiotics. the problem with those is that they are NOT healthy. quite the opposite. antibiotics are like napalm st
<Boltasar> BronyInstrumental: play more online, or mods, both can extend the game quite a bit
<Dark_Horst> whoa,w all
<Ninjazz|Quiet> Te-te-te-text wall.
<Cameh> lol
<sonicandmario85> Dark_Horst:it was the try a medic medicene or whatever its called
<Dark_Horst> regular shots are a lot healteir for you than getting sick and curing it
<sonicandmario85> Dark_Horst:it was for kids too
<Dark_Horst> flu shots are still ebtter
<Boltasar> ugh, gotta restart my computer... brb gurlzz
<BronyInstrumental> Boltasar: i used the tekkit mod pack, and only ever played online. still bored after a week
<cow334> Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qLpwObLgfw&list=PLAE1C556AFD532944&index=51&feature=plpp_video another one
<Jim> Or you can just get a medic to übercharge you right before the viruses and bacteria attacks you
<sonicandmario85> I DONT NEED NO FUCKIN FLU SHOTS I DO WHATEVER THE FUCK I WANT WITH MY LIFE
<sonicandmario85> );<
<sonicandmario85> :*
<killerpony7733> We are just telling it's not a good way to go
<MaxTheBrony> BronyInstrumental: agreed i got bored real quickly of it.
<Jmo> You know for a 10 year old you tend to swear quite abit.
<Ninjazz|Quiet> And then sonicandmario85 got sick.
<Cameh> alrighty then
<Boltasar> BronyInstrumental: tekkit modpack... Equivalent Exchange kills the need of making awesome redstone contraptions or huge buildcraft machines
<MegaMoonShine> How much music does that guy do?
<HiImSpike> Love how the kerbel people have no cities on their planet and yet they have the knowledge to build giant spaceships
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Jmo :)
<sonicandmario85> I HAVE GOTTEN SICK IN LIKE 2 YEARS
<Da> im bakc
<Jim> HiImSpike, Maybe they live underground?

<Gold_Demona> Falala falala falala LAAA~
<cow334> woot woot
<String_Shredder> sonicandmario85: okay
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: And you have been inside and only around your parents most of the time and all?
<Sylandest> this is suitable music
<Dark_Horst> HiImSpike: well, watcha think is the reason they build all those spaceships? hell, i'd be bored as fuck on that planet too
<MegaMoonShine> That acceleration... O______0
<Buytoast> glorious
<Vordox> Phase4: Dat Pony Power,..wtf
<Cameh> wtf
<Da> OH SHIT
<Gold_Demona> Fiiiiiigaro~ Fiiiiiiigaro~
<HiImSpike> bAHAHAHHAHAHA
<MLP_Brovakiin> hahaha dat fail :d

<Da> EXPLOSION
<Da> :D danceing capsule
<sonicandmario85> SPACE DRILL
<Vordox> Another successful launch, kerbal that is
<Ninjazz|Quiet> I'm getting a Looney Toons and Tom and Jerry feel for some reason.
<Dark_Horst> now... JUMP!
<Vordox> Ninjazz|Quiet: This song is one of the most used songs within classic cartoons
<Da> phase4 MOAR JETS AND ROCKETS
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: Still you haven't gotten so due to being in a enviroment your body knows well. If you spend more time with people and what not. You would be very quick with getting sick
<Ninjazz|Quiet> Vordox, no wonder...
<killerpony7733> sick*
<sonicandmario85> killerpony7733:yea i havent been around other people much
<Vordox> And yes, Tom and Jerry used this song, as well as Tex Avery' famous Orchestral piece, and even Woody Woodpecer.
<cow334> Phase4: This music is wonderful what is it called
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qHZkkgowdY
<Vordox> cow334: Barber of Seville
<cow334> thanks
<Vordox> Inb4 woody Woodpecker version :D
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: And that easily explains how you haven't gotten sick, You live in a place your body knows and you are adjusted to having your parents around.
<Ninjazz|Quiet> Ohey look! There's wittle kerbal scientists walking around.
<Boltasar> and back
<Serenity> BronyInstrumental: At it's current state, I agree.
<sonicandmario85> killerpony7733:sometimes my bro jojo visits or my other bro david
<Sylandest> figaro all the things
<HiImSpike> I recon living in space is really bad. Having to live in cramped enviroment, bones deteriating and ears are slowly becoming blunt and most being sucked by the vacuum of space
<MaxTheBrony> xD sunddenly opera in the chat :P
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: Still not too bad for your body, It was talking with generally being outside and not in your house and everything
<Ninjazz|Quiet> HiImSpike, that's why you have to go through ALOT of tests and exams before you're taken into space.
<killerpony7733> i was*
<Buytoast> you saw what happened in Wall-E
<Vordox> Are you sure you know what you are dooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing phaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase4?

<Da> lol
<Jim> So Perfect
<Vordox> Dat Timing Phase4 :D
<cow334> WHAT A FINISH
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: and that's why there' vaccines. they use a wide spectrum of different virus dns to make your immune system able to defend against most virus variations. dryruns for other environments, so to soeak
<Spectrum_Rush> dat timing
<cow334> WOOT WOOT
<sub06905> :D
<HiImSpike> Claps for Phase4

<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: And it doesn't help he stays in one enviroment constantly
<Spectrum_Rush> encore encore
<Vordox> cow334: Not the only one :D
<Jim> Now THAT should have been recorded
<HiImSpike> ROFL TROFFLE
<Vordox> I don't think Phase4 even noticed the timing
<cow334> Vordox: That was amazing
<Da> buffer
*cow334 starts to clap for Phase4
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: I mean generally being near crowds of people and when touching places other peoples hands has touched etc

<killerpony7733> Eeyup
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: I take it you want to go to next years B.U.C.K?
<MaxTheBrony> I wish i could :S
<BronyInstrumental> it would be cool if, next year, if there's another bronystate community panel they let all the bronystater atendees up to the panel too. that'd be cool
<killerpony7733> Hmm anything stopping you?
<MaxTheBrony> Family , friends
<MaxTheBrony> Im not that outward as a brony aswell... im too "shy"
<MaxTheBrony> or weak*
<killerpony7733> BronyInstrumental: Umm that's what happend, But it was very poorly thought out in that they suddenly asked the bronystaters to come up, Instead of telling them the panel will be there and they are welcome to go up there and be part of it
*Jmo slaps MaxTheBrony around a bit with a large trout

<Serenity> Only person's face I know is Sumic'as and Saturns
<GilDash|Gaming> killerpony7733: Yeah, I never intended for that to happen... :S
<Pony_Zen> I managed to stay pretty much of camera :3 I don't think there's a single pic of me, and no face in anz vids
<killerpony7733> Serenity: sumicas face? i never seen him ever
<Spectrum_Rush> i know Scoot-Scootaloo's face

<killerpony7733> GilDash|Gaming: Welp we can always continue reminding him
<Wrek> 05too bad the lyrics dont match up pony_zen :<
<Pony_Zen> I know...
<Wrek> 05Serenity: if you brohoof properly
<killerpony7733> GilDash|Gaming: But a alot more planned out and more informed BS panel for any bronystaters that want to get up there should be a good thing
<Wrek> 05it can be used as a mean of self defense
<GilDash|Gaming> killerpony7733: It should... but Saturn'll be organising it. XD
<Pony_Zen> funny thing is, I think I actually understand some of them, Wrek
<Serenity> Well, if you can stand left handed hooves, I'd probably break my wrist brohoofing
<BrOnyxia> well wrek knows about music
<killerpony7733> GilDash|Gaming: I'm thinking more of the, ''If you want to go up to the panel and be part of it. You are free to do so'' way
<GilDash|Gaming> killerpony7733: That's what we tried to do early on. No one wanted to come up. XD
<Dj_Cyber-4G> what language is this?
<Serenity> I'm gonna go dressed as my most classiest self

<Ponies47> Hey thelonepony
<Ponies47> :3
<Wrek> 05this is more epic metal
<Wrek> 05and im not meanign epic as in the term awesome
<GilDash|Gaming> Major: You don't complain when I use it. ;)
<BrOnyxia> Wrek: you should listen to firewind some time
<Wrek> 05im meanign like theres folk metal, glam metal
<Wrek> 05and epic metal
<Chrysalis> i think power or battle metal is a good way of phrasing it
<Wrek> 05albeit this is one of the less emtally songs
<Pony_Zen> GilDash|Gaming, I believe human body is weak itself, superior species wouldn't really even get exhausted at all, or need different varies of sustenance... also the running part already, mate, the fuq evolution? Y U KEEP US CRAP - Link - http://mlpf.im/1hD - So, I pretty much do my best to work on - not immortality - but invulnerability.
<Wrek> 05with a touch og glam
<Major> GilDash|Gaming: well dont bother to use on me, apparently GL owns me for 3 days :$
<Pony_Zen> :3 epic metal is good
<GilDash|Gaming> Pony_Zen: That's far too much science for me right now. Let me recover first. XD
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: did you forget the body below the table of the pony in the middle with his head on the table?
<GilDash|Gaming> Major: Take a camera with you. ;)
<Wrek> 05Spectrum_Rush: why sketch it out if its gona be black under the table?
<Pony_Zen> GilDash|Gaming, I did leave the science out of the con at least didn't I :3
<Major> GilDash|Gaming: well she did say 1 other pony can come with us :P
<Spectrum_Rush> tru, but you should still be able to see it is all for the perspective atleast
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: ^
<GilDash|Gaming> Pony_Zen: Ah, so *that's* why we didn't have a fire! :D
<GilDash|Gaming> Major: If that's an offer... ;)
<Major> GilDash|Gaming: well all you need is a tumblr and show her your OC and your all set :P
<GilDash|Gaming> Major: Tsk, somepony already drew me my OC... ;)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Pony_Zen think of evolution as stats in a game, what humanity sacrifices physicaly, we more than make up for in unholy levels of intelligence. Well, most of us anyway>_> yes Im looking at you politics.
<Major> GilDash|Gaming: I know :P
<Ponies47> GilDash|Gaming: Doh ho ho ho. Iknow who your talking about ;)

<Major> GilDash|Gaming: I will :P
<Pikachu> nice drawing
<fluttershyFTW> HALLO EVRYPONY
<Pony_Zen> DoctoDoctorWho, I do not argue with the fact our species have superiour intelligence (at least from all the species we know), but I still find our some of our disadvantages unnecessary by all logical sense. I mean, we have brains and technology the prevent a lot worse from coming or more likely being, but still... There could be so much more, we have examples of people with perfect memory, without they never even having to work for
<Pony_Zen> it, perfect cardio, as in my previous link, and much more... with the fun fact, they only have small DISadjustments... It's like evolution is trying to keep us from beng more superior on purpose, which defies all logic.
<Meanwhile> Tl;dr
<BrOnyxia> yo wtfflutter
<GilDash|Gaming> Saw that coming a mile away. :D
<Pony_Zen> sorry GilDash|Gaming

<Ponies47> I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of diet! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it!?! ^^
<Lil_B> MadSurge I liked the Legends of Equestria Panel at GalaCon and... well, just talking to people XD really, it didn't felt like a special thing, more like a big meetup
<Ponies47> *dirt
<Pony_Zen> Wrek, I'll kindly remind you that I love you now :3 J. Aho <3
<Anotherguy> Diet?
<Kakumy> Sabershy|Cleaning: Yes it is... I will never experience Bronycon :(
<AJIsAwesome> Kakumy: At least they get anime conventions. There aren't any conventions where I live.
<killerpony7733> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Yeah yeah. Quickly eating my dinner which should be 5-10 minutes
<PillowPoni|PrinterIn> ♪

<Sabershy|Cleaning> Kakumy: I won't to get to experience either. :\
<Chrysalis> heh awesome
<MadSurge> Lil_B: but it was a meetup about PONIES <3 BUCK was so much fun

<Kakumy> Btw when is Season 3 releasing... people say Aug then some say Sept...
<Serenity> I'm back
<Chrysalis> !cd
<Lil_B> Pony_Zen yeah, :/ in-country travel in germ,any is so expensive it's rediculus Saturn even complimanted us that we are good at making "Fahrgemeinschaften" , which only exist because of that reason XD
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<MadSurge> Lil_B: also Saturn gave us A PARTY CANNON :$
<Chrysalis> MadSurge there were 4 cannons
<Pony_Zen> Lil_B, also I'm busy pushing Fins to handle next Helsinki meet up
<Kakumy> So Season 3 not confirm yet 100% at all..
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: EVEN BETTER
<AJIsAwesome> Kakumy: Nope.
<Chrysalis> all went off at once
<Lil_B> MadSurge + one more reason, I would have met at least 5 fellow chat members there :P , you, GilDash|Gaming , Saturn, wrek and Chrysalis
<Kakumy> Amazing.... and Wrek takes forever to get a drink and snack
<Serenity> Lil_B: If you go next year, you'll meet me

<Serenity> Unfortunately, 80% of the brony population is full of fucktards
<Maid_RainBow> YourLittleDashie : hi
<MadSurge> Sumica: like a boss
<Saturn> 08,01so, did anyone here about the fire?
<Pony_Zen> GilDash|Gaming, It seems so, I saw you in one of the party pics though, just faintly
<Chrysalis> Saturn there was a fire?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I did.
<YourLittleDashie> Who want's some D'aww with their awesome Heavy drawing?
<Saturn> 08,01BronyCon had a fire, but we wanted to outdo them

<Meanwhile> Saturn: hear*
<Maid_RainBow> what fire Saturn?
<Chrysalis> i heard a guy got kicked out
<GilDash|Gaming> Saturn: Actually, Gollaka mentioned something but wasn't specific. :S
<Chrysalis> but not a fire
<Saturn> 08,01we were so awesome that we cause one of the buildings *across the road* to catch fire
<Pony_Zen> GilDash|Gaming, before you ask, nothing to do with me!
<YourLittleDashie> Chrysalis: There was an electrical short, which started a small fire
<Chrysalis> lol
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: so bronycon actually burned?
<GilDash|Gaming> Pony_Zen: Yeah, but that's okay because there's so many people it'll be hard to say who. :p
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: :D
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: there was a small fire at bronycon
<Chrysalis> Saturn we had partcannons, actual PARTYCANNONS
<YourLittleDashie> Here have some D'aww no charge: http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=Rainbow+Dash+plushie#/d556ji7
<Saturn> 08,01there was a larger fire in a building across the road from BUCK
<Chrysalis> that automatically makes us better than BronyCon
<MadSurge> Serenity: come to Ponygoons then, it's full of refugees from SA and they're all nice people :D
<Serenity> MadSurge: Already signed up :P
<Serenity> Been signed for months
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: i have heard so many people say that BUCK was better than BronyCon
<Dark_Horst> when exactly was bronycon? i'm starting to get confused
<Applejack2012> I just entered the bronycon chat as the fire started
<Saturn> 08,01BronyCon was in July, i think
<Applejack2012> Last month
<Pony_Zen> GalaCon guys also have admitted BUCK taking the lead
<Pony_Zen> some
<Pony_Zen> *
<GilDash|Gaming> Saturn: Honestly, I had more fun at BUCK then I did at Download this year. And I went with IRL friends to Download. XD

<Saturn> 08,01Serenity: location disparity
<Serenity> Wrek: Is that you, looking very MLG there?
<Dark_Horst> Spectrum_Rush: oi
<Pony_Zen> I'm so ashamed I forgot Saturn's gift
<Dark_Horst> the roof is on fire

<Serenity> :3
*Serenity is totally not a stalker.

<alexxm> how you doing Pony_Zen
<Pony_Zen> AWESOME
<Chrysalis> killerpony7733 i would agree longer hair, but i expected wrek to look more... viking
<MadSurge> Serenity: I recognized him from his OC pony :D
<Meanwhile> Right, attention returns, what's being drawn? :3
<Serenity> Well, mane colour and hair colour are slightly different
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Hey you should see me and you would be surprised how unviking i look for a dane
<Pony_Zen> Pirates
<Chrysalis> oh wow
<Chrysalis> MadSurge i never thought of comparing him to his OC
<Chrysalis> just wow
<Serenity> Peh, we all have our physical weaknessess
<Serenity> Mine is simply size, I'm 5"3' and 15 years old. I'm a midget

<Chrysalis> i had a beard on sunday
<Serenity> Yeah, what Pony_Zen said, you can't beat a moustache
<Meanwhile> Serenity: probably not going by the "4 years older than you" part.
<Chrysalis> but that was due to forgotten shaver :P
<Pony_Zen> ^
<MadSurge> hello Meanwhile! :3
<Pony_Zen> same
<Meanwhile> Allo MadSurge.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: My brother is 8 years older than me ;) same generation

<YourLittleDashie> OMG This is cuteness... prepare your hearts: http://derpy.me/FdhUn
<GilDash|Gaming> Chrysalis: I had a stubble, but that was due to not having enough freaking time because people needed picking up from airports and crap. XD
<Meanwhile> Serenity: Yeah, because that makes sense.
<Chrysalis> YourLittleDashie my heart was not ready
<Chrysalis> it just popped
<YourLittleDashie> Chrysalis: Just as planned... :)
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Yep ^^
<MadSurge> GilDash|Gaming: it totally suited you :D

<Canadian_Brony> -_(\
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<AJIsAwesome> MaxTheBrony: I know one thing. You're a better artist than I am.:)
<CrimsonPhoenix> MaxTheBrony, do you want to be talented?
<Dark_Horst> MaxTheBrony: you do art? got a gallery link?
<MaxTheBrony> http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/gallery/
<MaxTheBrony> I wish i was talented :p would make drawing so much easier.
<Canadian_Brony> defenitely better than what I can draw
<Dark_Horst> MaxTheBrony: the only thing i see wrong with your art is the sevwere lack of ponies
<Serenity> MaxTheBrony: Hey, don't shoot your foot about drawing skills, you're not that bad
<AJIsAwesome> MaxTheBrony: You're kidding, right? You're an amazing artist!:O
<Dark_Horst> not talented he say...
<MaxTheBrony> :) Thanks guys
<lowfn> MaxTheBrony: I love that RD Wallpaper you did. Would you mind doing one of Twi :$
<Canadian_Brony> Serenity defenitely don't shoot your foot! I did with a paintbal . . .
<thelonepony> oh hai Canadian_brony
<CrimsonPhoenix> MaxTheBrony, don't say that you cannot have talent
<CrimsonPhoenix> with that you're pretty much what an artist should be
<MaxTheBrony> lowfn sad Twi?
<XAX> Chrysalis: that picture could also sum up me, except as well as MW3, there would be about 5 other games in each frame.
<lowfn> MaxTheBrony: Happy.
<Merri> We postin' dA links? :3
<Chrysalis> the idea is still the same though
<Chrysalis> i play far less games in general
<Chrysalis> now i have ponies to watch
<MaxTheBrony> lowfn i can try :) but that will have to wait abit , got alot in school :)
<lowfn> MaxTheBrony: Okay. :)
<Canadian_Brony> I don't play many games because my computer won't run them.
<Merri> http://iammerriweather.deviantart.com/
<MaxTheBrony> Merri: you are welcome to post yours :)
<Canadian_Brony> but ponies are fine
<Merri> ninja'd ;)
<Serenity> Canadian_Brony: Pah, paintballs are so mediocore.
<Serenity> It's all about shotguns now
<Canadian_Brony> Serenity still hurt like hell.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d5c1boi dammit CosmicUnicorn
<Serenity> You get used to it
<CrimsonPhoenix> y u so good
<BronyInstrumental> my art is all traditional, i don't use computer programs :P so mine looks quite a bit worse than most people's, seeing as it's all done by hand
<MaxTheBrony> Haha Merri your comic about the Book xD
<Merri> :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> BronyInstrumental, for me just because you're doing it by hands makes you a better artist than most people here
<Pony_Zen> Alright, I'm off for tonight

<MadSurge> I can only hear "Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me" with this music now :D
<Boltasar> well, im out guurlz, cya tommorow likely.
<Ponies47> brb

<MaxTheBrony> Agreed but my school is gamedevelopment school so :3
<MaxTheBrony> it may be fun
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Boltasar
<MaxTheBrony> who knows
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Night!
<Soupjuice> what contest are we talking about?
<MaxTheBrony> Night Boltasar :)
<BronyInstrumental> i'm apparently still in high school :<
<AJIsAwesome> Boltasar: Night!
<tSparx> No no, I was talking to MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Sorry.:$
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: I appreciate your enthusiasm ;)
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Now that you think about it, I do too!:D
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks!
<Canadian_Brony> CANNOT UNHEAR!!!
<tSparx> So who's on stream?
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx Wrek
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Wrek.
<tSparx> Hallo nameless pony!
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx Wrek is drawing Pirate Rarity
<Ponies47> Back. Mah SPAHGETTI is ready yet :/
<alexxm> pirates and ponies somebody fund it
<Ponies47> *isn't
<Canadian_Brony> done
<tSparx> Well that's the coolest thing to happen so far today. One of the many reasons I love ponies and bronies: they always put me in a good mood :)
<Canadian_Brony> I already threw $20 at my screen
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: I already threw my life savings at the screen.:D
<Chrysalis> Canadian_Brony annoyingly i had the chance to throw actual money at wrek
<Chrysalis> but the cash machines were all empty :(
<BronyInstrumental> i'm not old enough to have a credit card, so cash machines are obsolete to me :(
<Chrysalis> BronyInstrumental your old enough for debhit
<tSparx> There's a minimum age on credit cards? Huh.
<BronyInstrumental> Chrysalis: i'm too LAZY for a debit cart
<Canadian_Brony> I wanna go to a Brony convention or meet-up or something like that.
<AJIsAwesome> I always liked debit cards more than credit cards anyway.
<Chrysalis> i had my debit card at your age
<Chrysalis> credit cards are a TERRIBLE idea
<Canadian_Brony> Debit is better than credit IMO
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Me too me too! I've never been!
<Canadian_Brony> no chance of debt
<BronyInstrumental> i'm too lazy for either
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Same here. There's one near me on Friday but I don't think I can go.
<tSparx> Chrysalis: I don't think CC's are evil, just need to be careful with them. I don't have one.
<Chrysalis> there is no advantage of a CC that an overdraft doesnt match
<BronyInstrumental> my parent's don't trust me with anything anymore, so i'm not gonna put a debit card by them :/
<BronyInstrumental> parents*
<Chrysalis> BronyInstrumental a debit card is fine though, if there isnt enough money
<Chrysalis> the transaction is declined
<Chrysalis> rather than getting charged for borrowing
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome I have to wait 2 years until I can drive. And I don't mean get my L license, because that isn't driving. That is controlling a car with your parent in shotgun hoping you don't kill them.
<BronyInstrumental> Chrysalis: ik, but they still don't trust me
*Ponies47 Hugs BronyInstrumental "I'm sorry to hear that" :(
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome driving is when you get atleast your N, 'cause then you can drive alone.
<tSparx> BronyInstrumental: Parents are weird, eh?
<Canadian_Brony> or with 2 friends
<BronyInstrumental> they think i'll waste all the cash on ponies. "waste", peh, whadda they know?
<tSparx> OH YOU CRAZY CANADIANS WITH YOUR LETTERED LICENSES
<Chrysalis> BronyInstrumental quite alot
<Chrysalis> theyv done it all before
<BronyInstrumental> Chrysalis: well, my dad didn't do it right. he's homophobic and racist and just plain discriminatory.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Not to make you feel bad, but I already have my license so I can drive. However, I have a lot of things to do concerning college. I REALLY want to go to this meetup before heading off to college.
<Ponies47> brb

<AJIsAwesome> I'm certain my college won't have any bronies......:(
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Thanks.:)
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: It's *college,* what the hell do you mean there won't be bronies? That's where most bronies are!
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: I'm sure there'll be at least one :)
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Not the college I'm going to.
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Thanks.:)
<AJIsAwesome> I'm hoping for the best.
<Canadian_Brony> I feel for you guys going to college in the US. We don't have to stay on campus at all for college, but apparantely you guys have to stay for atleast your first year.
<Canadian_Brony> ouch
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: If there aren't any bronies at your college, I'm gonna refer to it as "Dumby-Dumb Stupidy University"
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Yep. Sucks.
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: :D
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: It depends on what college, but that's the norm. At my college, I have to stay on for 2 years.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm going to University anyway. It's the only school near me with a Mechanics wing.
<tSparx> Or live at home, if your home happens to be within X miles of my school.

<sonicandmario85> Shizuka:also firefox is using alot of MB on here and it lags the video a bit so i have to pause it for it to stop and play it again
<name> yay
<sonicandmario85> Shizuka:if i use another browser will it stop?
<Shizuka> 13that's because firefox has become horribly bloated
<Shizuka> 13better than IE
<Cypresswolf> found some blue set blind bags while at Walmart for the battery - got 6 of them
<sonicandmario85> maybe mozilla will fix it sometime
<Serenity> Firefox memorly leaks like fuck
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I recently read Cheerilee's Garden... I somewhat regret it
<Serenity> Chrome is on the top step
<sonicandmario85> it used to not use up so much MB
<Sabershy|Cleaning> I am back! From god knows where.
<tSparx> sonicandmario85: That would require a major overhaul in how FF wants to evolve right now.
<Serenity> sonicandmario85: Still doesn't, but something screws up, and it memory leaks the living shit out your PC
<Canadian_Brony> hi Sabershy|Cleaning. Would you like a slice of pizza? It finally arrived

<tSparx> This game was my junior high.
<Barbetos|AtWork> The power of catsup/
<tSparx> I have always been a geek, true ;)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I shall fill the sound quota with cartoon sound effects
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Or not
<Major> there we go
<tSparx> w00t!
<TheMaster> :O
<Shizuka> 13sound now?
<Wrek> 05wee baldurs gate
<alexxm> this should be good
<TheMaster> you're playing the BEST game ever?
<AJIsAwesome> Eeyup
<Athgaar> holy crap I was watching a youtube video and this started
<kirzstryfe> I see a Shizu :3
<Shizuka> 13let's see that again with sound :3
<name> hmm new game for me
<TheMaster> boy am I happy I kept this on.
<tSparx> The chances of me getting anything done this afternoon just went to zero
<name> is this like ff1
<TheMaster> i heard the theme and I was like "oh god when did I turn bladurs gate on?"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sound.
<tSparx> name: It's a computer game based on a D&D universe
<TheMaster> what class are you going for?
<name> oh
<Serenity> Wrek: Asked teice already, hoping three times a charm: Have you played Darksiders II yet? :P Sorry if you've already answered, but I must know.
<Shizuka> 13when it comes to dnd i usually go rogues that can tank
<name> ooh hes dead
<alexxm> shit just got real
<Shizuka> 13so primarily rogue but with plenty of combat
<TheMaster> shizuka do you have tutu?
<tSparx> oh yes he can
<Athgaar> dat voice acting
<Shizuka> 13also... you hear sarevok get a running start to bash the door... but when you see him there's like three feet
<Shizuka> 13where did he run from X3
<Wrek> 05dont like darksiders
<TheMaster> obviously he ran up the stairs
<name> i like darksiders
<Wrek> 05plus im a PC gamer master race
<Shizuka> 13ded
<Major> ow
<Serenity> Wrek: It IS on PC
<TheMaster> is this going to be through tutu? Tutu is best mod
<Wrek> 05yapyapyap
<Shizuka> 13yes tutu
<name> played the first game sort of god of war ish like
<Wrek> 05Serenity: its a port
<alexxm> well that was a short game
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Tomato sauce!
<TheMaster> short game for him
<Shizuka> 13the end
<Major> well its better than falling to your death :P
<TheMaster> not every bhallspawn can be so lucky
<name> im an adept in all gaming systems
<TheMaster> though to be honest this game isn't as good a story as planescape torment
<tSparx> Someone explain Tutu to me, because back in the day I never messed with mods.
<Serenity> So was Skyrim, but you don't complain ;)
<Shizuka> 13Baldur's Gate Tutu is a mod that runs BG1 on BG2's engine
<TheMaster> Tutu takes baldurs gate 1 and uses all the neat stuff in BG2.
<tSparx> Ooooohhhh, me like!
<Shizuka> 13and adds BG2's magic and mechanics
<Barbetos|AtWork> Serenity GASP!
<Wrek> 05skyrim is able to mod away that
<Shizuka> 13seeing if val is able to multiplayer
<TheMaster> so basically you can jump from 1 to 2 without having to reclass or anything
<TheMaster> I can multiplay!
<Cypresswolf> 3 - crystal Pinkie Pie - 4 - Metallic Applejack - 5- Twilight Sky (clear stallion) - 6 - another stallion Mosely Orange - nice results in the blue blind bag set :)
<MASF123> i shall be out

<Athgaar> who is the vein pony in the bottom left?
<Shizuka> 13nope

<Shizuka> 13aww yeah i forgot i rolled DEX 17
<name> bye masf
<Serenity> The way the whole came works, it's designed for singleplayer
<Canadian_Brony> Athgaar Nitt IIRC
<name> but i play on ps3
<Shizuka> 13i'm a little dense though... INT 10
<TheMaster> Gameranger is the fastest way to host bg games i've found. without crazy port magic and stuff.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Vein pony?
<MASF123> see you Canadian_Brony. AJIsAwesome, thelonepony, tSparx
<TheMaster> also you know theres a baldurs gate pony mod right?
<kirzstryfe> "little dense" >.>
<kirzstryfe> :3
<Athgaar> red and blue branching lines
<Major> kirzstryfe: Hi :3
<tSparx> WHA
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: The hairstyle.
<Serenity> Oh course, of course he does, kirzstryfe
<Shizuka> 13well the rule of thumb is below 9 you are incapable of whatever that stat controls
<Wrek> 05skyrim works jsut fine as multiplayer
<tSparx> TheMaster: BG pony?!
<Wrek> 05the skyrim online mod pr oves it
<name> well then do we get to loot each other
<TheMaster> yes there is a baldurs gate pony mod. let me find it
<Shizuka> 13so like INT 9 and below means you can't talk right
<Serenity> There's an online mod? :U
<Wrek> 05as for TES online
<Wrek> 05why would i want anotehr button masher MMO
<slinky> what is this?
<Athgaar> baldur's gate
<TheMaster> http://saber-scorpion.com/gaming/mods_mlp.php
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think IRL, I have an INT of 18, but CHA of 9.
<Wrek> 05id rather have a multiplayer TES with coop osomething
<tSparx> Baldur's Gate
<slinky> oh...
<Athgaar> 18 int is rare
<Sabershy|Cleaning> Question guys: What can you do to get a better signal reception from your wireless router?
<Wrek> 05becasue skyrim online is a mod
<TheMaster> and baldurs gate already has multiplayer. its just not easy to play it online because of ports
<Wrek> 05the game wasnt made with it in mind
<Shizuka> 13hey look, phil and lil as BG characters
<Wrek> 05so theres a lot of broken shit to deal with
<name> no if you die do we get to loot each others if you die
<Wrek> 05we dont want another MMO
<name> ...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Get a less whiny voice
<TheMaster> Shizuka why not use the baldurs gate ponymod?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I assigned my stat points to intelligence and forgot to balance before God kicked me out of the Life start screen XD
<Athgaar> get the one that sounds most like a pony
<Serenity> Yeah, I think GW2, WoW, YTOR, Rift, Aion and some others are enough
<Canadian_Brony> I get soooooooo picky with character creation.
<name> ooh vget the irish voice
<tSparx> TheMaster: Is it just human!Ponies?
<name> i just watched braveheart BTW
<slinky> me too Canadian_Brony
<Athgaar> failing that, scream guy
<Shizuka> 13hm
<TheMaster> well you can't make the sprites ponies
<TheDoctor> Well hello TheMaster
<Shizuka> 13will go with the more noble one
<Serenity> Shizuka: Choosethe silliest one
<TheMaster> oh its you
<Canadian_Brony> hi TheDoctor
<Shizuka> 13i miss my cold killer voice set in NWN though
<Shizuka> 13i love that so much
<TheMaster> http://saber-scorpion.com/gaming/mods_mlp.php check it out though.
<TheDoctor> Hi Canadian_Brony
<Cypresswolf> I need to hunt my neighbor down - I loaned my skyrim to him, he's been playing for over a month, still hasnt beaten the game yet - he's trying to do everything before returning it
<TheMaster> its got the voices, character sets and pictures.
<TheMaster> so as far as a mod its not a big deal
<Canadian_Brony> Cypresswolf wrapping a game like Skyrim doesn't sound like an easy task
<name> im half way done moost of the side quest
<tSparx> Cypresswolf: Loaning Skyrim sounds like a dangerous proposition.
<Serenity> Cypresswolf: Want to borrow my supershotgun?
<Athgaar> who names a coast "sword"
<tSparx> It's the Sword Coast
<name> :O
<CrazyHippie1234> Hi everypony
<Canadian_Brony> hi CrazyHippie1234
<Cypresswolf> took me about 3 months to do a majority of the things in the game
<slinky> hey CrazyHippie1234
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ghost coast?
<tSparx> Named because it's all dangerous and stuff.
<Shizuka> 13Athgaar: The Sword Coast, so named because of the bandits and adventuring and whatnot
<TheMaster> because the coastline is apparently dangerous and hard to sail down
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Call it the death coast
<Athgaar> yes
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Or fluffy kitten coast
<Shizuka> 13the only problem i have with tutu is it doesn't keep the background music during these bits
<CrazyHippie1234> Well Hi Canadian_Brony and slinky
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Text seems hard to read. Should I go fullscreen?
<TheMaster> so what party are you going for Shizuka?
<name> i havent gone that far
<CrazyHippie1234> What are we watching?
<Shizuka> 13well imoen is always my sidekick, minsc too
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: Yes, please.
<name> i havent discovered alll of them
<Cypresswolf> Serenity: no, that wont be necessary - I know where he lives :)
<TheMaster> Minsc is a requirement
<Shizuka> 13usually i keep khalid and jaheira for the last two
<Serenity> Cypresswolf: Aww.
<name> i finished halfway of the one i discovered
<TheMaster> should pick up Viconia because she's best cleric
<TheMaster> also Grey Delise
<Canadian_Brony> CrazyHippie1234 Shizuka and Nittany_Discord are playing Baldur's Gate IIRC
<Shizuka> 13i've only ever finished once
<TheMaster> oh you're both playing together?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Buy NOTHING
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Only thing about going fullscreen: I don't have FMLE set properly for it, so stream quality may drop.
<name> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Gorion sounds like a dick
<name> spam
<Canadian_Brony> dat spam
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nice.
<TheMaster> Gorion is bestfosterfather
<tSparx> Let Shizuka play the game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mind if I try fullscreen Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13can try
<name> my first kick and spam
<prince-dari> INB4 first ban
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: No he's the best
<Shizuka> 13hopefully livestream isn't compressing it all out, the text is pretty small and i'm already fullscreened
<Canadian_Brony> hi prince-dari
<prince-dari> Hey
<TheMaster> man, it'd be neat to set up a full party of multiplayers
<name> :(
<TheMaster> also it looks like your framrate is very, very low
<TheMaster> by how slow your sprite walked
<prince-dari> name: (;
<Serenity> TheMaster: The game runs at 20-30 FPS I beleive
<Shizuka> 13buh... it kept my stuff!
<TheMaster> you can set it to what you want though
<name> :P
<name> princedarri: :P
<Shizuka> 13(you can tell i haven't come back to this in a very very long time)
<TheMaster> don't forget to get the golden pantaloons
<Serenity> Shizuka: Yes
<derp_derp> hello
<Shizuka> 13i think i had minsc hang onto the pantaloons..
<TheMaster> without the golden pantaloons the game is meaningless
<tSparx> derp_derp: Howdy!
<TheMaster> you know what happens if you keep them right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Livestream is compressing it out.
<Canadian_Brony> hi derp_derp
<Cypresswolf> Has anyone here played A Bard's Tale for ps2 or xbox?
<Canadian_Brony> wut?
<Shizuka> 13hm
<TheMaster> if you import your baldurs gate 1 character into bg2 you can keep the golden pantaloons
<Serenity> What's it about?
<alexxm> how you doing derp_derp
<tSparx> Wait, there's actually a reason to keep hold of those?
<Shizuka> 13dual monitors will make this...
<sonicandmario85> where do i need to go to download adblock?
<Shizuka> 13hmm..
<TheMaster> yes. because in bg2 you can aquire...the silver pantaloons!
<sonicandmario85> on chrome
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka dual-monitor is SO USEFUL!!
<Serenity> Wish my laptop would get fixed
<TheMaster> and if you import your bg2 character into throne of bhall.
<sonicandmario85> im using it right now
<TheMaster> you can get bronze underpants.
<Shizuka> 13yeah but it's breaking mouse scrolling
<TheMaster> which combine into. a giant robot suit of armor
<tSparx> Hahaha
<prince-dari> sonicandmario85: google
<prince-dari> :P
<TheMaster> which is the best armor in the game
<Shizuka> 13SO MUCH SINGING
<tSparx> Oh that's awesome! I did not know that xD
<sonicandmario85> also why does it lag when i chat..
<TheMaster> its the ultimate old save bonus
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Shut up!
<Barbetos|AtWork> My ears bleed
<Serenity> sonicandmario85: Because your computer is most likely terrible
<Barbetos|AtWork> D=
<tSparx> sonicandmario85: Streaming's tough on the server and on your comp.
<name> :[ MOAR BUTTER
<TheMaster> listen to what they're saying. its important
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is a pre-EA Bioware game IIRC.
<Serenity> Even shitbox can run Chrome
<Shizuka> 13i know
<TheMaster> in a game or two
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just saying, not starting.
<name> why do i har allah
<TheMaster> this is one of the best d&d based games ever made
<Shizuka> 13the wise alaundo can go eat a cow
<TheMaster> though planescape is the better story
<Cypresswolf> in the same genre as this game - you play a bard that gets roped into a mission to save this princess and there are several multiple choice quests bringing a different end depending on your choices in most missions
<name> i heard a guy same allah
<Serenity> Shizuka: Poor crow
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fucking shut up!
<name> say*
<TheMaster> Planescape <3 infinite love from me.
<Shizuka> 13i am protected from
<Shizuka> 13EEEEEEEVIIIIIIIL
<Canadian_Brony> SHUUUT UUUUP!
<tSparx> No no, he's talking about Alaundo
<TheMaster> though they don't make for very good streaming games.
<tSparx> Name
*name pokes Shizuka
<name> im evil
<Shizuka> 13gah
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know what we nee dto stream?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Magika
<Shizuka> 13oh i see the problem
*Canadian_Brony blinks
<TheMaster> for that matter these games are tough to play multiplayer
<Cypresswolf> wish I still had that game...ended up selling that and several other ps2 games for game cube
<Shizuka> 13there we go
<TheMaster> because everyone runs off and does there own thing
<Barbetos|AtWork> SpadeMagnes[R] Phase4 has done that befoer I think.
<Shizuka> 13i like that the tutorial is split up into all those guys standing around
<Serenity> Cypresswolf: No regrets, the cube is a good console
<Cypresswolf> bad trade off now that I think about it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> We definatly need to stream the pumpkin game
<tSparx> Shizuka: 'Show I remember it
<Cypresswolf> most were good games
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka the best kind amiright?
<TheMaster> so shizuka. did you only beat baldurs gate 1?
<Shizuka> 13yeah
<TheMaster> Bg2 is even better you know
<Shizuka> 13BG2 i stopped at like chapter 4 i think
<tSparx> Shizuka: You can skip straight past this stuff I think, though.
<TheMaster> blasphemy. thats only the underdark
<Shizuka> 13neat... crashed
<Cypresswolf> Game Cube did let me play Twilight Princess & Animal Crossing :)
<tSparx> TheMaster: It's also a LOT harder, haha. Took me a long time to beat it.
<TheMaster> i had no real issue until really the final boss in throne of bhall
<Canadian_Brony> I was wondering why my stream froze
<Canadian_Brony> great
<TheMaster> she's one of the hardest bosses i've ever faced.
<Shizuka> 13well in that case i'm jumping forward to my save..
<TheMaster> irenicus went down easy to me. but then again I knew where all the hidden loot is
<SpadeMagnes[R]> bing
<tSparx> TheMaster: I never claimed to be great at this game. I'm really, really bad at it actually, haha. I just really enjoy it :)
<TheMaster> its awesome. i've beat the game 3-4 times
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fuck you Windows
<TheMaster> wish I had people to multi with.
<Shizuka> 13iiiiiiii forget what i was doing at this point....
<sonicandmario85> Nittany_Discord:im using xp i dont get those errors
<Ponies47> test
<Major> Shizuka: you were talking about how BG2 stopped at Chapter 2 or something :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XP isn't as good for streaming as 7.
<TheMaster> the key to beating irenicus is getting the best gear.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In fact, I've never seen that error before.
<name> gaddam keyboard
<TheMaster> and having the right party.
<Shizuka> 13oh
<TheMaster> Keldorn + carsomyr=instant destruction
<Cypresswolf> Just once, I'd like to play my games without Windows crashing - JUST! ONCE! :|
<insert_name_here> ..
<TheMaster> and if you can get a mage the staff of the magi, robe of vecna and ring of gaxx you're also basically the god of magic
<insert_name_here> :[ MOAR BY
<insert_name_here> BUTTER
<sonicandmario85> lol skydoesminecraft refrence
<Major> XD
<BronyInstrumental> what's on stream?
<Barbetos|AtWork> That error is annoying
<TheMaster> sorry, I will contain my nerding out of baldurs gate
<Ponies47> The chat derped about 20 minutes ago and I just nocticed O_O
<Cypresswolf> been contemplating getting a Mac, but some games arent availabe for mac :(
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its best to keep your theme in basic to avoid it
<kirzstryfe> target and walmart each have a different set of blindbags... >.<
<cow334> hello every one
<Barbetos|AtWork> Also Basic helps with performance
<thelonepony> hello cow334
<name> ..
<AJIsAwesome> cow334: Hi!
<Cypresswolf> and I cant afford a $1000+ new computer right now
<sonicandmario85> this chat needs butter....dododododo *starts throwing butter everywhere* oh yeah butter......dodododo
<TheMaster> baldurs gate 1,2 and planescape torment are actually all on gog for 10 dollars each.
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord probably better than Vista. This thing is a RAM hog. XP runs TF2 with only 2GB of RAM, but Vista won't with 3GB
<Canadian_Brony> I should upgrade to 64-bit and get more RAM
<TheMaster> this is a different game.
*cow334 waves at every one
<Canadian_Brony> hi cow334
<Shizuka> 13of COURSE i've been waylaid by enemies and must defend myself!
<TheMaster> did you travel through time Shizuka?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Random encounter?
<name> im seeing smexy time from here in my tv
<Canadian_Brony> woah
<Canadian_Brony> so much chat lag
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If that message comes up again, I'll switch schemes.
<TheMaster> Oh Minsc. you are best party member
<sonicandmario85> also if i dont type very fast its because i have to take a shit and im holding it in because it hurts but im gonna have to go sometime DX
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just killed a few non-essential to streaming programs.

<TheMaster> so Nittany you're playing?
<Shizuka> 13i am
<String_Shredder> name: Chairmode activate

<TheMaster> why did you kill Viconia?
<tSparx> We're lagging behind, Shiz, don't spoil it!
<name> ok
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K.
<kirzstryfe> unless you don't have the game, but then you wouldn't really need the mod then now would you :P

<SirGanjalf> Hey, what's u-HOLY SHIT BALDUR'S GATE

<Canadian_Brony> hi SirGanjalf. Eeyup
<TheMaster> and most encounters in bg2 involve an enemy mage
<name> how can you beat a mage
<Soupjuice> nyahahaha

<tSparx> "Basically in BG2 you're screwed" -- my playing experience :3
<name> kick the *squee* ack to oblivion
<TheMaster> what did you pick as your main character?
<name> oops wrong game
*Bronysith glomps Nittany_Discord
<SirGanjalf> I've finished BG with Xan & Branwen, istead with Minsc & Dynaheir. Yes, i'm weird:P
<TheMaster> tSparx it helps to play baldurs gate 1 so you can get a good feel for your playing style
<TheMaster> xan?
<name> hai Bronysith
<TheMaster> how did you put up with his emoness?
<Canadian_Brony> hi Bronysith

<tSparx> TheMaster: I do love Rangers for D&D, but who knows what I went with
<name> tSparx what do you want
<TheMaster> Mages are the way to go in my opinion. if you can survive long enough you become basically a god
<TheMaster> though Edwin is always fun as a party member
<tSparx> name Oi?
<name> stop pinging me
<tSparx> I'm not attempting to ping you :/
<name> my ears hurt i have ear phones on
<TheMaster> its because your setname is very pingable. you should probably change it.
<Canadian_Brony> name it's because of your name. I suggest you change it if you don't want to be overloaded with pings
<name> aww i gtg bai
<tSparx> Oh is it because I keep using the word name? Hahahahahaha
<Canadian_Brony> seeya name
<tSparx> bye name!
<Shizuka> 13there it is
<SirGanjalf> In sequel i've had Imoen, Jaheira, Minsc, Jan Jansen and Aerie. Then, in ToB i've exchanged Aerie to Sarevok.

<TheMaster> and I replaced Minsc with Sarveok in TOB. I hated to do that but minsc just couldn't keep up
<Canadian_Brony> g'night GilDash
<SirGanjalf> if he's in your team, ofc
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it's cursed, so you can't remove it unless you go pay to have it remove.

<Canadian_Brony> even before I was a brony
<tSparx> Quick_Thinker: How old are you, if you don't mind my asking?

<Quick_Thinker> well she wants me to make friends and other shit (i dont have a lot of high school friends
<Wrek> 05makign friends doesnt work liek that

<SirGanjalf> nyahahaha
<tSparx> 'Cause if you're 16 or so, I'd say it's time to do every teenager's least favorite thing: actually stand up to your parents.

<Wrek> 05I WANT THAT BAG
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<Quick_Thinker> well the thing is no one in school knows what the hell a brony is
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: This may sound dangerous to do, but you must stand up against your parents. You are expressing who you are, and you have the right.
<tSparx> Quick_Thinker: And?
<Dashee> Is this Diablo?
<Quick_Thinker> they dont even know what steam is
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Canadian_Brony: /)

<Wrek> 05lookign at highschool as the following
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: You are in the same boat I was when I was a closet brony. People will make fun of you and they probably won't ever change, but that's because they are being ignorant and judgemental. You can change the social norm at your school. You have the power to do this. Just believe in yourself.
<Wrek> 05it will be hell
<Wrek> 05people with be fucking idiots
<Wrek> 05but live through it
<Wrek> 05and everythign will feel so much ebtter
<Chrysalis> just realise
<Chrysalis> the main reason those people are assholes
<AJIsAwesome> What Wrek said, too.:)
<Chrysalis> is they have absolutely nothing going for them
<tSparx> I'm an out bisexual male at an all-guys school. I promise you, I got through it, you will too :D
<Chrysalis> and are too lazy to actually do anything about it
<SirGanjalf> dat dream
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Quick_Thinker: its cool man
<Dashee> Only My best friend and my older Bro know i'm a Brony
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: /)
<tSparx> Er, was at an all-guys school, haha. A moment ago...
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: That takes courage, my friend.
<Chrysalis> wear it with pride Quick_Thinker
<Canadian_Brony> Dashee my entire school and closest family know I'm a brony thanks to one person.
<Chrysalis> and get to a meetup/convention
<Quick_Thinker> well im hoping i can find a way to stop welovefine from telling my mom she can return it
<Shizuka> 13woo cure light ability
<Chrysalis> youll never feel so proud to be a part of such a wonderful community
<Canadian_Brony> Dashee surprisingly, that was not my younger sister
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: What was your parents' reactions to this item?
<Dashee> Who was it?
<tSparx> tSparx: Nah, when you're bi, you can placate them with talk of Carmen Elektra etc. etc.
<AJIsAwesome> *were*
<Dashee> Canadian_Brony who was it?
<tSparx> Er, AJIsAwesome
<Quick_Thinker> they "think" im going to get beat up
<Quick_Thinker> even though no one gets beat up anymore just mentally abuse now
<JakyBoy98> hey anyone mind giving me the short of what this convo is about?
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: No problem. I make the same mistake.:$
<AJIsAwesome> JakyBoy98: Quick_Thinker bought a twilight hoodie and his parents want him to return it.
<JakyBoy98> ah
<JakyBoy98> thanks
<Quick_Thinker> the thing i dont get is they are fine with the bag but not the hoodie
<Quick_Thinker> they said ITS PURPLE YOUR GOING TO LOOK GAY
<Dashee> Return it and get the Rainbow Dash one :)
<tSparx> Quick_Thinker: Well and even so, you'd get through it, haha. And maybe, as a compromise, you can just agree not to wear it at school for a while.
<JakyBoy98> whats so bad about a hoodie with ears and a horn?
<Meanwhile> Quick_Thinker: you're*
<Quick_Thinker> yeah a compermise might save my ass
<Canadian_Brony> Dashee an old friend. I told him over Steam chat I was a brony. The next day, he tells a friend at school who is also a brony I am. A week later, I invite him for dinner and tells my parents and 6-yr-old sister I watch MLP. I never felt my face turn redder.
<tSparx> Quick_Thinker: "Ma, pa, here's the thing: I wait until I've made some friends, and I won't wear the hoodie til then, but I'm not taking it back."
<Quick_Thinker> i might just wear it around home and at Canterlot Gardens con
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: Definitely at Canterlot Gardens.
<Quick_Thinker> tSparx you might just have saved my ass
<Quick_Thinker> might

<Chrysalis> heres a question which iv never gotten a proper answer for
<tSparx> My parents are the most liberal, laid-back, awesome parents I've ever heard of.
<Chrysalis> why do you feel the need to tell your parents?
<Chrysalis> its not like it actually affects them
<Canadian_Brony> Chrysalis beats me. After all, I wasn't the one who told them anyway.
<tSparx> Chrysalis: Well because we have a desire to be open to our parents, relate to them, share our interests.
<Dashee> I haven't told my Parents, they wouldn't care much what i watch anyway
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: Fuck knows. To tempt the disownment fairy?
<tSparx> But yeah, I'm in Dashee's camp.
<Chrysalis> tSparx do you share everytime you watch a new tv show?
<Spectrum_Rush> Chrysalis: ooh thats a simple one, kids need the approvel of there parents... for some mentl reasons
<Quick_Thinker> oh yeah and for some note taking and evidence the entire chat about the hoodie is being saved in word to use effectivly
<Chrysalis> "coming out" as a brony

<Dashee> Why do people make such a big deal about someone els watching a tv show?
<Canadian_Brony> Please please PLEASE don't make a joke about that! I'm tempted enough myself!
<MadSurge> Scoot-Scootaloo: :D what did your friends think of you watching ponies?
<AJIsAwesome> Chrysalis: You have a point, but if you haven't reassured to your parents what you're doing, they'll be confused and possibly think that you don't want to confide in them and trust them. I don't know.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> its ok Quick_Thinker: we dont judge
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I mean it's not bad, but to use that term is... I dunno, doesn't sit right with me :S

<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: It tells the tale of what woud have been the origin of Nightmare Night, and the catalyst element that forced Celestia to banish Luna. After defeating Discord, Canterlot was witnessing a very slow recovery. Misery could still be found everywhere around, specially for the ponies that had less means.Luna thought that expanding the kingdom and founding a new pony colony elsewhere would give a solution to the problem, allowing the ponies

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Who the hell is Boxxy>
<otakon> who the HELL was that?
<Meanwhile> Iiiiii...don't remember that bit.
<Saturn> 08,01i am a terrible person:
<CriticKitten> otakon: Let me quote it directly.
<Saturn> 08,01[01:02:11] Andrew Bell (Saturn): CDN = Content Distribution Network
<Saturn> 08,01[01:02:30] Andrew Bell (Saturn): think of it like a fleet of mexican postmen
<Saturn> 08,01[01:02:56] Andrew Bell (Saturn): you send a letter to them, and they duplicate it thousands of times and send it to thousands of people, using thousands of mexicans
<otakon> Meanwhile: me neither
<Saturn> 08,01[01:03:23] Andrew Bell (Saturn): sorry if that's a bit offensive; i should have said "postpeople"
<Azura> SpadeMagnes[R] Some bitch nobody cares about
<otakon> Saturn: lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The hell are you doing Saturn
<Meanwhile> Yes Saturn you are. But it's ok because you're cool.
<MASF123> i don't get it
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: he's being Saturn
<Shizuka> 13you're a bad filly saturn
<VenHur> Guys, gtg, rain in my area.
<sonicandmario85> PUNCH!
<Saturn> 08,01it's an accurate analogy.
<otakon> bye VenHur take care
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I dont get it, what did Saturn do?
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: nothing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The video used to end with Fluttershy saying the N word.
<otakon> he's worried about being PC
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: AH
<Meanwhile> Niggle?
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: nitrous?
<Vordox> Saturn is turning American. WE'RE ALL DOOMED!
<Meanwhile> It always sounded like Niggle.
<CriticKitten> otakon: According to EA and Bioware, Command and Conquer Generals 2 will not have single player. This is, in their own words, part of a strategy to "get back to the roots of what made Command & Conquer great."
<AJIsAwesome> Nigle?
<otakon> yh sounded like niggle to me
<AJTheMightyGamer> nicotine?
<AJIsAwesome> Nigel?
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: fo shizzle.
<MASF123> If he did NOTHING then why is he discussing it? :O
<sub06905> neville?
<Wrek> 05im sure the word was nutrient
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yaaay!
<sonicandmario85> YES THIS

<CrazyHippie1234> How was this a punishment?
<Bronysith> EAT ALL THE CHOCOLATE MUFFINS
<sonicandmario85> THIS IS WHAT LUNA DID FOR 1000 YEARS
<MASF123> He said the secret word!
<pwny> aha!
<Wrek> 05CriticKitten: the SP of the first C&Cs is waht made it so great
<thelonepony> what does this video call?
<Wrek> 05i loved the cheesy cutscenes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I also love how EA speaks for Bioware.
<Vordox> Wrek: the mission briefing
<CriticKitten> Wrek/Nittany: Exactly! Thus why the statement from Bioware made my brain just SHATTER.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like the story.
<Azura> I WOULD LIKE 10 BILLION KRABBY PATTIES!!!
<CriticKitten> Oh no, it's Bioware, Nittany.
<Vordox> Memories. <3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bioware didn't make C&C.
<CriticKitten> That statement came from Bioware's general manager.
<CriticKitten> They're the ones making the new game.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: bioware was indoctrinated by the rEApers, of course EA will speak for them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're probably being forced to make it a spin-off.
<sub06905> inb4 Nittany_Discord EA rant
<Bronysith> sub06905: too late
<CriticKitten> sub06905: I may just beat him to it.
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Wrek> 05if generals 2 wont have any campaign
<Wrek> 05then fuck it im not buying it
<sonicandmario85> EARTH
<Wrek> 05i was LOOKING FORWARD to know what happened in that universe
<Wrek> 05but oh well
<CriticKitten> Well then good news, Wrek, you don't HAVE to buy it. You see, it's a free to play game.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01wonders if EA is trying to fail now. *shrug*
<Wrek> 05would probably be Origin only anyways
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01^
*Slenderman walks in and sees the video. Slenderman performs a perfectly executed headpalm.
<CriticKitten> They announced that Generals 2 was going to be Free To Play through Origin, and now they've said no campaign mode.
<Azura> ok then... im going to continue on applejack beating the sh*t out of a SWAT
<Buytoast> Origin is the future of gaming.

<otakon> the one on the left
<otakon> with FS and RD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Blowing money on inflated budgets. Deciding on what the gamer wants (when it's NOT what they want). Pissing of their consumer base at every turn. Getting voted Worst Company in America over a greedy bank, and then not caring.
<sonicandmario85> humanized just ruins it their suposed to be ponies...
<Wrek> 05so now they gotta mkae back the money they dont need
<sub06905> you mean gen 3.5

<Bronysith> Wrek: 4kids logic
<Buytoast> For being like 9/11.
<Vordox1> Nittany_Discord: Mad Day by Rabies Bun(pony related)
<Kandarihu> More than half of the banned Pokemon episodes are badly arranged clips episodes. So rightfully banned, not even WE want to seem them
<Derpy_Hooves> SlurryMoon
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You mean like we cant say someone dies? We have to say they went to the shadow realm?
<Buytoast> And that tentacool/tentacruel episode was bitchin.
<Vordox1> None of them D:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek, you mean that r63 ep?
<Bronysith> misty x tentacruel

<Kandarihu> I saw that episode before 9/11. It was an okay episode.
<Wrek> 05Nittany_Discord: im talkign generally
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also that tauros episode
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Since it was banned where the shit did the 30 tauros coem from
<alexxm> wasn't that because of guns
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Explain it 4kids ya twats
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], I wouldn't characterize a story with killing in it as inherently educational.
<otakon> yay!
<Derpy_Hooves> SlurryMoon
<sub06905> dat top comment
<CrazyHippie1234> Dat comment?
<sub06905> :D
<Buytoast> Oh no, he pulls a gun out on Ash!

<otakon> where is SlurryMoon?
<Azura> iis that his tongue, or bottom lip?
<Bronysith> otakon: did the baby start crying after i said space ninjas?
<otakon> Azura: looked like his bottom lip
<otakon> Bronysith: no
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, it's pretty much the ONLY episode in which it happened.
<otakon> UP!
<otakon> GO UP!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God forbid we dont show guns
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Like yugioh
<Bronysith> otakon: but i would totally understand if she started crying after that lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Invisible gun fingers
<Azura> otakon I thought is was his tongue...6_9
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: and yet GIANT DRAGONS destroy CITIES with godamn LASERS
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R]: "DONT MOVE OR WE SHOOT YOU WITH OUR INVISIBLE GUNS"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't want r34 to pop up, so I'll screen that for later.
<otakon> Bronysith: I will teach her of games later on
<Buytoast> Fuck, they even didn't show a Jynx episode because they thought it was too racist or some shit.
<Bronysith> otakon: good, make her a true gamer instead of these wannabe assholes
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Stream the pumkin avi full
<otakon> Buytoast: black face, which is not really funny
<Wrek> 05remember the days where the tom n jerry episodes were ok on TV?
<otakon> Although they did it with popo
<sub06905> yup
<Bronysith> oh yea
<Bronysith> good times
<otakon> WHICH WAS BULLSHIT!
<otakon> goddamn blue Popo
<Bronysith> ugh
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh god this video
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Remember the days Ren and Stimpy was acceptable?
<Buytoast> it's not like the Jynx would be saying "I LUV ME SOM CHIGGIN SIR!"
<otakon> they didn't even DO IT WELL
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Creepy as fuck
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: I do.
<Buytoast> it's a bloody pokemon.
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: Oh, definitely.
<Kandarihu> Censoring the one episode of Pokemon in which guns are seen makes sense (except for the manner in which they did it). Censoring the guns in One Piece was absurd.
<XylemTube> Love this song
<AJTheMightyGamer> ...
<Bronysith> Blue popo looks like more of a rapist than regular popo
<thelonepony> poni poni yaaa
<XylemTube> poni poni
<otakon> Kandarihu: oh so much, and SO MUCH UNNECESSARY censoring too
<sonicandmario85> twilight?

<Wrek> 05want it need it is creepy
<otakon> Kandarihu: not just the cleavage or guns, but stuff for the hell of it
<Wrek> 05but awesome
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Didnt one of the main characters in One piece actualy die?
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Those edits were the main reason why I hated 4kids
<thelonepony> ace died
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The chick with the blue hair i think?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do remember when the old Looney Tunes was regularly shown.
<WalkerPony89> Hai guys
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: yh but the 4kids never got that far
*AJTheMightyGamer bops head
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yea they just forgot that bit
<WalkerPony89> What the fuck did I talk into?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With violence and stereotypes and all.
<alfopony> the original video freak me out :O
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: oh yeah that, instead she get's imprisoned forever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Popeye the Sailorman.
<Azura> evil twilight is evil
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know old Looney Tunes did WW1 to death.
*Random-pony tackles Shamroc
<otakon> well it's Dance of the Pink Elephants ALL OVER AGAIN!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I hated 4kid's style of censorship
<Shamroc> ow?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now WW2, WW1.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*Not
<WalkerPony89> Video games got WW2
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: I hated 4 kids for killing some of the greatest shows on television.
<Kandarihu> You think 4Kids cutting out the Safari Zone episode made a huge plothole, they cut out two canon ARCS of One Piece creating more than two gaping plotholes that took further editing of later arcs to try to fill in.
<Wrek> 05donald as nazi still is my favorite disney short
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: oh god so much here too. also, considering you NEVER see any nudity in One Piece I don't know why
<otakon> Wrek: I should watch that one again
<Shamroc> and been a shit long time since i came to this dead place
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Might I stream that?
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: IKR?! I was pissed when they did that.
<Wrek> 05well
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: POISON SUCTION
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's on YT.
<Wrek> 05im ok with it since its satire
<WalkerPony89> Nittany_Discord: Yes please. I've never seen it before
<sonicandmario85> PINKIE

<otakon> AJIsAwesome: lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Posion suction?
<Bronysith> otakon: whats the first game you are going to show her?
<AJIsAwesome> HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE POISON SUCTION.
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: dur fuhrers face?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I got sick of the dub of one piece so I stopped watching it
<alfopony> ^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I enjoy watchign the japanese dubs
<sonicandmario85> I SAW A FIREBOY166 VIDEO
<sonicandmario85> OMG IM SUBSCRIBED TO HIM :D

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Before that, a new trend to lol at.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Kitty!
*Bronysith gives alexxm a bag
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Some bad guy in the japanese dub used poison darts. 4Kids changed it to poison suction.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03To those living in Texas: Good luck out there!
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: when Don Krieg fights Luffy he hits him with MANY poison darts....in the 4kids version they changed it to Poison suction darts..that still caused Luffy to bleed and the voice actress acted like they took effort to remove
*alexxm smokes whats in the bag
<sonicandmario85> cat watching a video on tv...
<otakon> lol
<alfopony> lolo
<AJTheMightyGamer> well i am off. bye everypony

<pwny> lol
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: ............
<AJIsAwesome> AJTheMightyGamer: Bye!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why take them out
<Bronysith> otakon: how about when they removed 14 episodes IN HTE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION
<otakon> goddammit you don't see the issue on how SUCTION DARTS CAN BE POISONED?!
<otakon> or LEAVE BLOODY WOUNDS?
<alfopony> AJTheMightyGamer: bye AJ
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I do
<otakon> bye AJ take care
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I dont see the issue why the darts had ot be edited I meant
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: I'll have to find the video of it
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: The fact they tried to edit something for an older audience to make it suitable for kids.
<sonicandmario85> toast
<Bronysith> otakon: you know they skipped 13 or so episodes in the middle of a sentence right?
<alfopony> HA
