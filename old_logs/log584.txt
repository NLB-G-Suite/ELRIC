<Canadian_Brony> sergio_scriptor I was quoting Paul

<VenHur96> A movie in a movie game.
<VenHur96> MOVIECEPTION
<sergio_scriptor> Canadian_Brony: i know...but that is what comes to my mind :\
<derpy_pony> movie adaptions were never good
<Michael> lol
<allponiesarebestponi> hey like COD
<sonicandmario85> super mario bros was kinda good though
<Canadian_Brony> sergio_scriptor I could see that, yeah
<tigher1001> reminds me of tacoman

<Richardkion> Last action hero game
<Canadian_Brony> Left!
<Richardkion> *vomits a bit*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Should be good nao
<Dov> This is more lag than a pvp match in dark souls.
<Kandarihu> Well, that's the way licensed games tend to be. They weren't made to be good. They were made to tie in with a movie.
<derpy_pony> no, not good
<sergio_scriptor> DoomrbringerZero:
<derpy_pony> buffer circle
<Canadian_Brony> Dov that's alot of lag
<VenHur96> Last Action Hero = The First Viewtiful Joe
<sergio_scriptor> hey it's the buffer show :)

<Dov> well time to go play darksouls lol
<ThrackerzodReal> Scoot-Scootaloo, its kay

<Jmo4267> Oh David Tennant.
<Bronysith> http://cheezpictureisunrelated.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wtf-photos-videos-the-computer-store.jpg Sumica
<Bronysith> Jmo4267: everyone is gay for tennant
<Saturn> 08,01today, they're playing Beethoven's Symphony No. 8 (already played), some weird modern piece (on now), and Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 (after this piece)
<Jmo4267> Obviously. :D
<Sumica> 00,10Cool illusion floor
<sergio_scriptor> Jmo4267: if there would be someone that should have the honor to deliver the torch in UK it should be the doctor :)
<Agrold> sergio_scriptor: I've been wondering about that.. What if he doesn't light it? Will time and space collapse or wasn't the opening ceremony a fixed point in time and space?
<cratorkid> Bronysith: i need those floors
<sergio_scriptor> Agrold: then the world will be doomed D:
<Novarak> Does anyone remember the episode where he actually runs the torch in 2012 ^_^(i think it was 2102 atleast)
<Jmo4267> sergio_scriptor If only he still was The Doctor. :'(
<MrPipin> 30 min :D
<Sumica> 00,10Doctor who?
<Chrysalis> just the doctor
<Obsidian> Exatcly
<sergio_scriptor> Novarak: yep,that is what im referencing about :)
<pony_7007> what is this?
<Agrold> sergio_scriptor: Yeah.. but is it a fixed point? because if not, it can be rewritten. But then again.. you neer know if David will show up:P Would be awesome if he did
<Novarak> :D
<DJPON3> I love the doctor <3
<MrPipin> doctor ftw
<Novarak> Matt smith ran it this year didn't he?
<Waffles> woah
<VenHur96> So the Olympic stream is in a half hour or so?
<Agrold> Novarak: Eyup
<Novarak> *claps*
<Alchemist> I know its absurd but wouldnt it be awesome to see a random equestria flag when the olympic teams march in? :D
<sergio_scriptor> Agrold: im guessing it's only a fixed point if the carrier falls,and then some random guy (the doctor) would carry the torch :)
<VenHur96> *clop clop clop*
<Jmo4267> I cried when the 10th doctor regenerated. </3
<Chrysalis> be prepared for the most british of all openings
<DJPON3> Alchemist: YES
<Sundaysmile> Applauding his music or that he finished?
<sergio_scriptor> Jmo4267: me too :'(
<Novarak> @Sundaysmile, not sure..
<Novarak> How do I respond to someone :o
<MrPipin> Chyrasails: are u from the uk ?
<cratorkid> Sundaysmile: prob music , even tho it sounded like sh*t it must be REALLY difficult to do thhat
<Sundaysmile> type their name
<Sundaysmile> like you just did
<cratorkid> Sundaysmile: or atleast i assume
<Novarak> So that worked? alright then
<Bronysith> Saturn: david tennant should light the fire to start the 2012 olympics
<Sundaysmile> yes Novarak
<sergio_scriptor> so if the olympic carrier falls to the ground,and some someone picks up the torch THAT would be the real doctor :O people today we might proove the existence of the time lords and the Tardis :O
<Obsidian> Bronysith: If only....

<Kandarihu> I honestly had my doubts that London could pull off a good opening ceremony. But this is pretty good.
<StinkomanFan> ...So England got the Olympics again this year?
<Stallion_of_Games> As an American Synic, I'm obligated to say that ours would have been better

<VenHur96> Bwahahahahaaa!
<StinkomanFan> ANTARCTICA ISN'T A COUNTRY
<Om> fancy
<cratorkid> then one brakes off
<Stallion_of_Games> Marx: I'd hazzard a guess at BBCA
<pikOlympics> Stallion_of_Games: Right... I made a small typo there.
<sergio_scriptor> :'(
<StinkomanFan> YOU A PENGUIN IN A SUIT
<String_Shredder> Where's Black Sabbath to represent more British music when we need them...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Also North and South America count as one, apparently
<Chrysalis> you know what, a red arrows fly over there owuld of been perfect
<Jmo4267> Dem rings.
<pikOlympics> Top view is amazing.
<GilDash|Olympics> String_Shredder: Too bloody right! :D
<Kandarihu> Marx, NBC has exclusive rights to Olympic broadcasts. And they run stuff on a tape delay
<StinkomanFan> And there goes the smoke cloud
<alexxm> that went better than i thought it would have
<Alchemist> and back
<pikOlympics> No. You're lying.
<Lil_B> StinkomanFan yes, and they made the first Live TV Broadcast in History there :)
<Obsidian> No Doctor Who? I am dissapont
<Chrysalis> and now to cool down 5 MASSIVE red hot rings
<sergio_scriptor> alexxm: i know right ?
<cratorkid> njope beijing was better
<pikOlympics> You know Beijing was better.
<Stallion_of_Games> There are 7 continents last I checked... Although I doubt that Penguins would be good at summer games
<GilDash|Olympics> It's not over yet...
<Sumica> 00,10lol of corse they will say that
<Saturn> 08,01"happy and glorious" is part of our national anthem
<Sumica> 00,10they are brit anouncers
<Lil_B> why DO they make these Pompous intros anyway?
<sergio_scriptor> Good,that was impressive,NOW SHOW US THE DOCTOR
<LadyCanary> Heehee
<String_Shredder> Imagine America's version of this. Hamburgers. Hamburgers everywhere.
<Saturn> 08,01which, in my opinion, is the *worst* national anthem of any country
<VenHur96> Best opening ceremony...since...EVER.
<StinkomanFan> Lil_B, and they lost TWICE to Africans!
<LumpOfCole> Happy and Glorious sound like the names of two british ponies
<Saturn> 08,01it actually has a verse about smiting Scots
<Ilchymis> Soviet union had the best national anthem ever
<derpy_pony> scottish you said, Saturn?
<GilDash|Olympics> Saturn: "God save the Queen~"
<StinkomanFan> inb4 Mr Bean fucks it all up
<Agrold> dem yellow hats
<Chrysalis> those damn scots
<Kandarihu> String_Shredder, no. Hamburgers are not a significant part of our culture.
<pikOlympics> I think the Soviet Union's National Anthom has the most beautiful sound to it.
<Attack|Minecraft> Which country is this now?
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, it's fine for Flower of Scotland, because it's not our *official* anthem
<TheXIIILightning> In b4 Daniel Craig
<StinkomanFan> CORGIS
<MadSurge> Saturn: THE NERVE :|
<twilight_sprinkle> they shouldve hired the old James Bind
<Alchemist> I'd like to see a Stephen Fry at some point
<Major> Prince Charles?

<Lil_B> StinkomanFan to quote Hitler "I hope I will never have to hugg a N***er again in my live" XD
<Flyboy> erm... what is this?
<LumpOfCole> Bond
<Chrysalis> ohai bond
<VenHur96> Daniel Craig, you mean JAMES F'ING BOND?!

<pikOlympics> Queen vs. Bond.
<GilDash|Olympics> I need less lag. >_<
<Kandarihu> Bonded
<LumpOfCole> wowowwww
<alexxm> bond
<Flyboy> Saturn: what is this? why is there james bond?!?!
<VenHur96> OH MY GOD, JAMES BOND AT THE OLYMPICS?!
<Saturn> 08,01we need some doctor who up in this shit
<Stallion_of_Games> Saturn: If you wouldn't mind talking about it, I'd be interested to hear about the whole intra-UK racism thing.
<DJPON3> LumpOfCloe: ALL MY YES
<String_Shredder> Kandarihu: I live sort of south so 'Merica 'Merica is part of my culture
<MadSurge> QUEEN
<Chrysalis> oh shit, its actually the queen...
<Obsidian> Saturn: Yes
<Jmo4267> Kill it with fire.
<Saturn> 08,01Flyboy: Olympics
<StinkomanFan> The Doctor's busy having tea with Wallace and Gromit
<Alchemist> reset my connection, no change. oh well, listening to it is more than nothing :(
<Operatorpony> GOD I HATE THE QUEEN!
<sergio_scriptor> StinkomanFan: :D
<Lil_B> und thus he was ignored
*Chrysalis kills Operatorpony
<fluffle_puff> things just got interesting
<Waffles> T^T Operatorpony
<Jmo4267> Seems legit.
<VenHur96> That's means...this is the filiming of James Bond 23?
<Flyboy> Saturn: yes but why is there james bond
<Operatorpony> cute dogs though
<TheXIIILightning> Get to da Chopper!!
<String_Shredder> test
<LumpOfCole> who escorts the queen? james bond lol
<cratorkid> if bond is here then the doctor will pop out too
*VenHur96 loves Wallace and Gromit.
<alexxm> the choppa
<Jmo4267> soisoisoisoi
<Saturn> 08,01Stallion_of_Games: to be honest, there's not much of it. well, it depends where you are. i did get bullied at school, first because i was brown in a white school, then because i was scottish in an english school
<GilDash|Olympics> I'm going to have to leave so you guys don't spoil it for me. Sorry. :)
<pikOlympics> Operatorpony: You may want to watch out. James Bond is out to get you now.
<String_Shredder> Inb4 it's matt smith's doctor
<Operatorpony> pikOlympics: :p
<Saturn> 08,01but apart from that, i hardly ever see it myself
<Kandarihu> This lady is awfully old for a Bond Girl
<Ilchymis> Daniel Craig is not bond. Bond does not have blonde hair. Danil craig is too buisy having the same number of facial expressions as Chrisian stewert to ever get it on with the hot female villan
<sergio_scriptor> the doctor is more badass then bond...just saying :\
<Kandarihu> Er, the queen.
<Operatorpony> is that teh real queen??
<Jmo4267> I'll cry String_Shredder
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile, Mr Bean and the Cast of Monty Python have a non-verbal arguement
<Operatorpony> wait.. that IS Bond, lol
<Operatorpony> low res
<Sumica> 00,10totaly not pre recorded
<pikOlympics> Operatorpony: As far as anyone knows.
<Chrysalis> totally
<Novarak> we can all agree that the doctor will be in it
<fluffle_puff> London is now officially a joke
<Saturn> 08,01scotland, england, paddys, and sheepshaggers all get along nowadays, pretty much
<Major> O_O
<MadSurge> String_Shredder: the one that doesn't exist?
<Kandarihu> Sorry

<Saturn> 08,01apart from the jokes
<Major> WTF?!
<Saturn> 08,01as above
<sergio_scriptor> Novarak: i hope so :|
<MadSurge> MOVING STATUE
<Lil_B> Saturn I german I and think our Anthem is quite a bit too self-praising too (and I'm actually kinda happy we only sing the 3rd paragraph anymore)
<DJPON3> Seems Legit
<TheXIIILightning> Even the statues XD
<alexxm> how horryfing
*Chrysalis suddenly feels proud
<Agrold> this is all live
<VenHur96> It doesn't matter if Daniel Craig is the worst looking Bond out of all of them!
<VenHur96> Jeez.
<Operatorpony> so how is this part of the Opneing ceremonies? is it apre-recorded video?
<Novarak> DONT BLINK
<StinkomanFan> HArry Potter is on his way with Ron Weasley to the Quiddich event

<cratorkid> ENGLISH
<Lil_B> the asian guy looked like Satoru Iwata
<pikOlympics> Iron Man's Heart Piece.
<derpy_pony> Lil_B: I find it should be more violent. The hungarians have a cool one. Italy isn't bad either.
<Chrysalis> suddenly live

<pikOlympics> Totally looks like Iron Man's heartpiece.
<Stallion_of_Games> One wishes to open the games
<fluffle_puff> This has to be the most embarrassing opening ceremony ever
<cratorkid> BOOM
<Marx> Ok, are they actually starting the Olympics, or is this a practice thing?
<Dovah> I want Monty Python!
<Operatorpony> FTQ
<Alchemist> derpy_pony: do you know the lyrics of the hungarian one?
<Major> Saturn: TATICAL QUEEN! IN COMING!
<LumpOfCole> lololollll

<Stallion_of_Games> Yeah... the Queen's TOTALLY going to paracute
<Lil_B> derpy_pony why would I wan't my National Anthem, to represent my Own Country and what it stands for, to be Violent? I find that unexceptible, unless your country really is just dedicated to war

<StinkomanFan> It sure gets dark early in England
<Kandarihu> Chrysalis, indeed it is, but I think the Olympics have to be geared towards all ages, including the very old. James Bond is okay, since it's been around for many decades. Dubstep only really caught on a few years ago, and is only enjoyed by some youth.
<Michael> sssssshhhhh
<Flyboy> i want i light up cover biatch!
<TheXIIILightning> Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<pikOlympics> XylemTube: No. With the constant "Welcome to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London" I really doubt it.
