<RAWRity> RaveBrony: oh I certainly wouldn't say Rarity is "perfect". One of the reasons she's my favorite character is because she IS flawed, and in a way that interesting and at times subversive plot lines can be used.

<cachi01> thats a perfect excuse to go and watch that shit
<Reikim> ...Wait
<Reikim> No
<Reikim> We are not discussing that
<RAWRity> it's 50 shades of grey, and I don't believe she's actually in that.
<Reikim> That book
<Sumica> 00,10while you do that lets get the pony eps out the way
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Feb. 10, 2012.

<RaveBrony> O.o
<Reikim> Boobs are not everything.
<Meanwhile> So SaxyPretender|Dinner you going to mention that Airplane was an A last time?

<Sumica> 00,102012 it is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,012012 is not a bad movie.

<RAWRity> it's just booooooooring
<Saturn> 08,01i only enjoyed it because of the banter in here
<DashWithRainbows> Phase4 is late too!?
<Reikim> Look, it got a 39 on RT.
<cachi01> 2012 is a C movie
<cachi01> C for CRAP
<Reikim> Thus, it's B.
<prince-dari> Because they spelt Aeroplane wrong, and because we streamed it as A last time too. :P
<Sumica> 00,10aroplain
<EspyLacopa> No complaining about "Is this an A or a B" until the mods finally provide clearcut an objective rules for what defines an A or B movie.
<RAWRity> Reikim: and it grossed 769 MILLION dollars.
<RaveBrony> Hahaha, 2012
<Saturn> 08,01Rariplane
<prince-dari> ^ Bretty good 5/5
<Reikim> RAWR, we don't go by that anymore.
<Sumica> 00,10right then let the bitching commence
<Reikim> The mods changed the system.
<cachi01> MFW bayformers 4 is being made
<RaveBrony> Im very grateful to that movie :D

<DashWithRainbows> dari best get out the booze for that movie.
<Kinixys> Pan is amazing. Try to be here if you haven't seen it somehow.
<OohShiny> what movie's next?

*Kurra bets his car title, his Mac, AND his tablet AND all his drawing skills that the world will not end when they Mayans say it will. Guaranteed bet.
<MrBen> I missed the lottery!

<J_E_Smith71> OohShiny: It's called Color of Music
<Saturn> 08,01well, i did point it out last week how long it was when it was picked
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> MrBen: Vordox, LordDerpington, Sumica, jangledorf won.
<RAWRity> 2012 is a bloated, overlong, horribly acted, terribly shot, load of computer Generated shit spat out by a film maker who stopped giving a fuck years ago.
<Ish> Phase4 and for ponies
<doctor_whooves127> well at the current rate of decline by next month it might be down to like 50 entrys
<RAWRity> and worst of all, it's boooooooooooooring
<RaveBrony> This is the reason why i dont choose a 'B' movie
<EspyLacopa> Once again, we run into the fun fact that unless it's blatantly told how the mods define A or B movie, other people will continually surprise them with different expectation for if one movie is an A movie.
<Kinixys> HogFather is pretty good too.
<Saturn> 08,01it's The Colour of Magic, and it's based on the first and second Discworld books by Terry Pratchett

<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: Dari is correct, we don't have our two fingers backwards here.
<Tamazarashi> Twoflower. Manly name.
<Pale_Horse> Seems Legit.

<Dken2021> gah, Iris destroyed me, and I had her to like two pokemon
<Kandarihu> Kurra, uh hi. I'm not following BMN this weekend. Indie Games for Good is running.
<Rex_Ivan> Bullshit! Librarians use the dewy decmal system
<Pale_Horse> Just a ridiculously powerful tome of magic shifting around. Nothing to be concerned about.
<cachi01> BLARGHARGH
<Nyst> T rex sound
<DocSane> Saturn: I liked the one where religious fanatics were torturing people to spread their message that the world was round and orbited the sun.
<Kurra> is cool Kandarihu. :>

<DocSane> Buytoast: The COunterweight Continent
<Pale_Horse> Those would be appropriate directions on a disc. yes
<Ish> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0e3y4QaSr1roud46o1_500.gif
<Kinixys> Cause the world is a disc.
<Sumica> 00,10death is bored
<Tamazarashi> DEATH
<CrazyHippie> oh and Hi everypony
<AlienWarhead> hi CrazyHippie
<cachi01> lol nigel
<somepony_else> east and west would be turnwise and counter-turnwise
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, CrazyHippie. :)
<Kurra> The Death wears Adidas
<CrazyHippie> hi AlienWarhead
<Nyst> There's a tiny continent on the other side of the disc that balances the thing out.
<CrazyHippie> Ello AJIsAwesome|Busy
<J_E_Smith71> He's just hanging with Death
<Fenr> snake,wolves and a fall
<Buytoast> so is he really a wizard, or is he just a poser?
<Fenr> nice death-plan
<Nyst> It does so by being a lot heavier then the rest because it's filled with gold.
<thelonepony> Hi CrazyHippie :)
<Dken2021> yup, this chick here http://derpy.me/P8cXE
<LunasGuard> I so want that outfit
<MrBen> J_E_Smith71: Quite literally, at that
<OohShiny> fall to your doom
<Jesse_> NOOOOO!
<Dj_Cyber-4G> lol
<LunasGuard> u cant cheat death
<Dj_Cyber-4G> it protected him
<owloysius> he has a nice chest
<OohShiny> the mimic saved him
<Sumica> 00,10that seems like a fun way to ride
<cachi01> Dken2021: i guess she uses a pichu?
<Dken2021> I cheated death once, he owed me a silver dollar
<Saturn> 08,01RANDOM DISCWORLD TRIVIA: The official motto of Unseen University is "Nunc Id Vides, Nunc Ne Vides", loosely translated as "Now you see it, now you don't".
<Marco> ohai Megalomanic
<Ish> has anyone found the plot yet?
<owloysius> is this discworld?
<Reikim> Yeah, that one.
<Pale_Horse> Truthfully, not even Death knows exactly when Rincewind will die.
<Sumica> 00,10nice door
<Dken2021> no, she has freaking dragons on her side
<owloysius> nice key
<Midnight_Splendor> Man Death really hates rincewind in the books
<Cypresswolf> And then Rincewind took a handful of gold coins as compensation
<OohShiny> what's the name of that movie that the guy plays chess with death for his soul?
<AlienWarhead> The elder scrolls told of their return
<Randomnerd> I'm under the impression this is how most Terry Pratchett books turn out.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> the color of magic
<Buytoast> this looks like an entertaining series
<Pale_Horse> Cause his hourglass is all messed up
<J_E_Smith71> Spike would like to have word with you, red guy
<Kinixys> I wonder what Rincewind's hourglass looks like.
<Fenr> bingo!
<Fenr> XD
<Reikim> Most Pratchett books end...
<Reikim> ...
<DocSane> OohShiny: The Seventh Seal, one of my favorites.
<Reikim> Well they all end differently.
<J_E_Smith71> I missed so much I haven't learned their names yet
<owloysius> i have heard tales of the cheeseborn
<OohShiny> DocSane: thanks
<Reikim> Most incorporate a subversion or three, though.
<cachi01> Dken2021: not even an umbreon?
<Vash> you know, he looks like eddie izzard
<owloysius> he once devoured 7 dragons while fighting a wheel of cheese
<Gentelmen-geeky> im a potato
<Randomnerd> Dragons? Daenerys?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> secret passage to the knee
<MrBen> I need to read Discworld. I've never read any of the novels at all
<DocSane> OohShiny: "The blood still pulses in my veins, the sun is yet at its zenith. And I... I, Antonius BLock, am playign chess with Death."
<somepony_else> cheese is awesome
<cachi01> HER GODDAMN HAIR IS BLACK AND YELLOW SHE MUST HAVE A FAKIN UMBREON

<Randomnerd> Khaleesi!
<Randomnerd> Khaleeeeeesi!
<Everlasting_Joy> Question, would anyone ever trust a Tim Curry?
<Gentelmen-geeky> got to go
<Buytoast> i can't tell if tim curry is good or bad
<Reikim> The Colour of Magic ends on a literal Cliffhanger because there's a second book.
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: tim curry is amazing
<Dken2021> so just tuned in to this movie, anything making sense yet?
<Buytoast> well yeah
<Spectrum_Rush> Tim Curry is Tim Curry
<otakon17> Curry is awesome
<Buytoast> he's wonderful
<Reikim> Starts with a Deus Ex Machina that's actually quite well explained and then goes on from there.
<Sumica> 00,10Lets say he is ambiious
<MrBen> Dken2021: lolnope
<Kinixys> I like curry.
<DocSane> Dken2021: It's a convoluted story.
<Buytoast> ambigious?
<Buytoast> woriks for me
<OohShiny> avada kedavra
<Kinixys> Spicy
<Dj_Cyber-4G> eww necromancy
<OohShiny> damn, I thought he was gonna kill him
<otakon17> Its Discworld
<Dj_Cyber-4G> i hate necromancers
<Randomnerd> Boom.
<otakon17> Ofc its good
<cachi01> is there any cliffhanger ending that ends with the character actually hanging from a cliff?
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi death
<Reikim> From The Light Fantastic onwards, however, the books are mostly standalone.
<Buytoast> ha
<Sylandest> Death is wonderful~
<Pale_Horse> Ohai
<Dken2021> hey there otakon17, how are things?
<OohShiny> sup death
<Reikim> cachi01: End of Colour of Magic. Rincewind is hanging, from a tree root, off the edge of the world.

<Nyst> I miss Myst.
<Sumica> 00,10kabong
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Busy: why so...s---ilent?
<Kinixys> lol
<Pale_Horse> Round planets are NOT nonsense. They're just built differently than the Discworld is all.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dark92Enigma: I'm actually working right now. I can't see the movie. I've been through the same thing. I became a brony around early April, and it took me until about August to tell my parents.
<Megalomanic> meanwhile
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: Ambitious wizard is trying to knock off Rincewind to recover powerful spell he carries as Rincewind accompanies a tourist on a crazy adventure.
<ntfwc> they are way too good at knocking people out
<Sumica> 00,10mawige
<Coldays> just joind what is going on

<MrBen> Of course, steal the uniforms. This plan couldn't possibly go wrong. Genius!
<Sumica> 00,10wuv tew wuv
<DocSane> Why do people make such a big deal about admitting that they liek a cartoon?
<Nyst> Not very efficient, round planets and all. You can only life on the top, and slide off the sides. And the bottom is right out unusable!
<prince-dari> Huh
<Kinixys> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I told my mom, then got her to watch a few episodes iwth me. XD
<prince-dari> I just realised why the gender of the turtle matters
<prince-dari> Oh dear.
<Dark92Enigma> DocSane: why is this movie closer to a DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS movie, THAN THE ACTUAL FILM!????
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<Nyst> prince-dari: I had the exact same reaction.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DocSane: Society and their opinions on your behavior. It affects most people.
<owloysius> Let's start this turtle sexing!
<Coldays> iwhat
<Sumica> 00,10certen death......ssssss
<Pale_Horse> This sounds like a job for Mike Rowe.
<Buytoast> deaths or depths?
<doctor_whooves127> flip a coin heads its male tails its female
<pony_300> Nyst: not nessecarily; put some gravity on that bottom and you got infinite shade! ...... or a frozen hell, depending.
<Dark92Enigma> Kinixys: i still have yet to show her the 1st episode
<Coldays> heads
<DocSane> AJIsAwesome|Busy: It's just admitting you like a TV show, not that you're practicing deviant behavior.
<Buytoast> so are they going to have to boink the turtle?
<Sumica> 00,10I need to boldly go
<Phase4> 00,02the luggage has a homicidal intent toward anyone who attempts to harm his master right?
<Coldays> i hop not
<Phase4> 00,02what if his master attempt to harm himself
<Pale_Horse> Go like *This*. You've got a little scenery in your teeth there...\
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica: don't you mean.............TO BOLDLY FLEE?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I know, but most people in life aren't as accepting as others (even when it comes to cartoon preferences).
<princess> they relise :S
<Dark92Enigma> Pale_Horse: You got something on your l------
<OohShiny> another buffer here
<Coldays> wtf is that
<Sumica> 00,10so how much longer till plot arrow
<Kinixys> DocSane: Just watching a kids show is a little odd, but being into it can be construed as deviant.
<princess> O.o
<MrBen> Sumica: Until the climax, I suppose.
<Sumica> 00,10oooooooooook
<somepony_else> ook
<Tamazarashi> lol

<Spectrum_Rush> Buytoast: nah different guy
<LunasGuard> LOLOL
<Everlasting_Joy> Buytoast: No, Tim's still fine.
<EspyLacopa> Nyst: If they understood it, it wouldn't be magic.

<Reikim> What?
<Shizuka> 13best client
<Saturn> 08,01why is he pronouncing "ook" as if it's Dutch?

<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Well Tim Curry IS in this film...
<Paranoia> apparently the guy just couldn't let the tiny dent on his car go

<Pale_Horse> This was a good gig.
<Stormy> it was terrifying; I seriously thought I was going to die when he was coming at us

<Stormy> there really isn't one
<Paranoia> some jobs just require it I guess
<Stormy> Yeah, except that

<ShadowBlitz> lol
<Reikim> Herenna the Henna-Haired harridan
<Kencolt> Until Mustrum Ridcully took the position of Archchancellor, the most common way for a wizard to advance was by "losing" a superior Wizard. After him, not so much. Ridcully is... different.
<Reikim> *Harridan
<Stormy> Another problem is timezones...
<ntfwc> yay it's Conan
<Coldays> cohen
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: I used to draw stuff for FlareChaser! Until he turned to the dark side of the fandom and i refused to draw what he requested....

<RaveBrony> Drawing on paper relaxes me
<Stormy> XD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it moves the soul?
<Reikim> I do it to boost my ego and/or as a form of meditation.
<Fenr> O_o
<Reikim> Or because I'm bored.
<RaveBrony> Using my tablet? Stresses me out :D
<Vash> she's robbing the grave in this relationship

<Sumica> 00,10bad pun
<Kinixys> Wooden..
<Ish> So, the most interaction I've had with this one girl is her telling me I'm her friend. I was wearing an Arch Enemy shirt at the time, apparently liking metal gets you instant friendship with her, I'm questioning whether or not I should go for it.
<otakon17> Lol
<Kinixys> I love that luggage.
<taoumi> -_(\
<LunasGuard> twist....
<otakon17> We all like that luggage

<J_E_Smith71> Then they overtake all the humans
<otakon17> Don't worry Death isn't a huge thing there
<Stormy> I'm actually reallly surprised how many people still come here from "the old days"
<AlienWarhead> Wait a minute if that star is the symbol of wizards is that why Twilight has it on her cutie mark
<Vash> he took out the archwizrd, doesn't that make him the arch dude?
<Ish> Well, I'm not sure whether or not I wan't to. On one hand she likes metal, on the other hand, she's a bit of a...um....emo
<otakon17> Goodbye Twoflower
<Tassadork> so twoflower sounds like he's american... I never got that. was fourecks supposed to stand in for the states?
<BoulderDash> How do the Discworld Turtles have sex to make the eggs???
<Paranoia> yeah, me too
<otakon17> Tassadork: Basically yeah
<Ponies47> My OC is supposed to be a stallion but mose pictures I has of him, he is a she. Dem R63 OC's.

<Everlasting_Joy> BoulderDash: Maybe it's asexual reproduction.

<Reikim> Um
<Reikim> No
<otakon17> Sad Rincewind
<Ponies47> Ok maybe
<Reikim> Why are you making snap decisions now
<Kencolt> Twoflower is actually from a sort of pastiche China/Japan. Fourecks is pretty much Austrailia.
<AlienWarhead> BoulderDash: very clumsy

<RaveBrony> *cough*hitandquitit*cough*
<Stormy> I had to ditch because SR got mad at me lol
<otakon17> AlienWarhead: Like Krogan >_<
<BoulderDash> Don't you think inhabitants would notice giant eggs being left behind by the turtle?
<Leadhoof> Freakin' -magic- space turtles.
<Ponies47> I shouldn't even be trying. I have never had a girlfriend
<Coldays> well i must say this was a good movie both parts
<Reikim> If you don't find she pulls at you in a romantic way you can at least still be friends.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> LOL xD
<Paranoia> what else is new
<Pale_Horse> Must have been a poor priest.
<DeadpoolDash|Zzz> so what are we watching?
<Paranoia> :P
<Stormy> not that
<Coldays> ponys
<otakon17> BoulderDash: First time it's happened in recorded history for them
<J_E_Smith71> Thn they became giant Ninja Space Turtles
<Ponies47> What? I'm only 14. Gimme a break damnit. .-.
<Stormy> It happened like 2 years ago
<otakon17> What was it?
<Stormy> Now he denies that it happened though, go figure
<owloysius> [GOLD]
<J_E_Smith71> Oh god, so that's how Micheal Bay's Alien Ninja Turtles come from
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Gold I guess..
<Fenr> lots,lots and lots of gold
<owloysius> is required to see this response
<otakon17> The luggage
<RaveBrony> I got my first gf after freshman year :P
<Kencolt> Tassadork: Twoflower is from a sort of mixed Japan/China, and Fourecks is pretty much Austrailia.
<Dken2021> fine for you then
<Stormy> maybe he just doesn't remember
<Paranoia> that's just who he is
<Stormy> and thinks I ditched for no apparent reason
<Kinixys> otakon17: I guess it only happens once in any world's history.
<Pale_Horse> This is, in actuality, a better gift than the gold
<RaveBrony> Lasted until the end of Junior year :D
<Paranoia> cant admit he's wrong
<PinkiePieYoshi64> ooooh, Luggage (goo)
<Pale_Horse> If a bit more psychotic
<Ponies47> I'm a wittle high school freshman
<Paranoia> I can't judge now really
<otakon17> The Luggage loves Rincewind by the wag, fiercely in fact.
<Paranoia> haven't talked to him in years
<RaveBrony> But boy was she a Btich! haha
<prince-dari> Luggage has saved your life so many times
<Stormy> Me either until like a week ago
<prince-dari> It would be useful
<otakon17> Eeyup
<Kencolt> Pale_Horse: Rincewind is of two minds about that, you see...

<Sylandest> there we go
<otakon17> See?
<Kencolt> otakon17: The single most magnificent bastard in the entire Discworld series, the Patrician. The only man who comes close is Samuel Vimes. He's not as much of a bastard, but he's pretty high on the magnificent.
<Kinixys> Happy luggage!
<Everlasting_Joy> RaveBrony: I'm in Minnesota, all of the conventions are 1000 miles away.
<LunasGuard> the new marlin
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: It's so true. At Canterlot Gardens I talked to so many girls.
<otakon17> Kencolt: Ah neat thanks
<Stormy> then no one would have voice and we would all be screwed until Aristeo fixed it
<BoulderDash> Why can't luggage be Twilight's pet instead of Owlicious?
<Everlasting_Joy> At least.
<Ish> I suppose I'll join the never had a GF club, I'm 2o btw
<sonicdude558> lol
<RaveBrony> Everlasting_Joy: Aw damn.... I know that feel T~T

<Silver_Spoon> So are we watching what is likely to be another 20 minutes of alternate endings?
<RaveBrony> Your recent trip, Ponies47??

<Sumica> 00,10ground floor> call it a tower

<otakon17> Sumica: Ping lag test
<doctor_whooves127> internet memes you guys internet memes
<AJIsAwesome> AlienWarhead: Considering her morals, she probably put him there as both sympathy and to embarass him. To maybe teach him a lesson in the chaos he's caused.

<Stormy> "I'm sorry now unban me" "No" "F U"

<sub06905> dat berry punch
<cow334> Its a draw...sand down
<kirzstryfe> just so you know, all of those people that say high school was the best time of their life?
<otakon17> Coldays: They aren't powerful enough on their own to even challenge Discord
<kirzstryfe> they've had really sad lives
<cow334> :(
<The_Awesomeness> so now that twilight is anti twilight and the opposit of magic is science ANTI TWILIGHT IS THE ELEMENT OF SCIENCE
<pony_300> I love discord, he's just trying to have some fun
<Dken2021> I landed a retail since september, course since it's a new store, there hasn't been much hours for the manager's been giving
<BroPony|MEDIC> ^
<donutpop365> The without friends who needs enemies thing was depressing...
<Cades> I'm wondering if I should even bother trying to revive this place
<ntfwc> The_Awesomeness: but she likes science too
<im_texting_my_dog> Her element is magic...she got discorded she can still use her magic?...I don't get it.
<Coldays> well thats a fail of its own
<BroPony|MEDIC> Withdraw Arrow
<Rex_Ivan> I really DID think they were gonna go for the "I have no more enemies and am bored with that" angle
<twilight_sprinkle> AlienWarhead: dont know harleys voice to well, but iirc it was just sort of in the middle between those two modes
<cow334> pony_300: if they were to just give him some fun for a little hed be alright
<BroPony|MEDIC> Lazy celestia
<Rosfox> Poor spike
<Azuredragon> poor Spike
<Coldays> pain
<Sumica> 00,10notice all the letters are un opened
<Evil_Spike> Poor Spike

<twilight_sprinkle> the princess has been busy torturing spike for fun
<im_texting_my_dog> lol
<Azuredragon> Ninja'd

<Ponies47> My mother said high school was the best time of her life. No she's wrong. Highschool is hell and it sucks. If you were in my shoes you would know why .-.
<AJIsAwesome> im_texting_my_dog: Her element is based on friendship, not magic particulary.

<Kimori1> true

<Mozdoc> Ponies are made of marshmallow anyway, I don't think Fluttershy had to pull much.
<Canadian_Brony> dem eyes
<Cades> lately it seems all my posts have gone pretty much unnoticed though :/
<Kurra> And I bet her wings are smaller then normal, and she beats them very fast.

<The_Awesomeness> youd think after a major disaster like dicord everyone would be dead or something
<Stormy> I feel like the only reason I ever fit in here was because I knew SR
<Kencolt> cow334: If you compare statue 1 and statue 2 you realise that the first time he expected to be sealed-- and he's in SHEER HORROR the second time.

<AJIsAwesome> Crackledon/10
<Dken2021> well if you're like that, I don't blame them, but ultimately, it's your decision if you want to branch out and meet people. Probably in their opinion, they see the quiet shy student as having trouble fitting in and might do poorly in school

Perhaps not one you really understand, but a reason. But this... thing? As much reason and a fish with a bycycle. Which I have seen, by the way. It's rather pathetic."

<Canadian_Brony> hi AdamTheDuck
<DeadpoolDash> do moar sfm
<cow334> and im not lying ethier
<Quick_Thinker> this is one of the coolest Source things i've seen
<Kencolt> the Pony/TF2 crossover community frightens me.
<Quick_Thinker> it makes me SMILE SMILE SMILE :D
<Ponies47> The other day I was BLASTING "Smile Smile Smile" into my ears at school. It was so loud you didn't even need to have the earbuds on to hear it :P
<NocturnalBlade> yay ^_^
<Quick_Thinker> OH MY GOD
<Canadian_Brony> that was hilarious
<Quick_Thinker> YESYESYEYSYEYSYEYSYEYSY
<Quick_Thinker> all of my freakinyeses
<Ponies47> I wub Fluttershy <3
<Quick_Thinker> form the PMV to this DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<oni_link|sick> This song
<oni_link|sick> ...
<oni_link|sick> O,O
<richfiles> BUFFER NOOOOO!
<Canadian_Brony> this reminds me of a TF2 mod calld Freak Fortress 2, where one person is a boss, or "hale", and the others try to kill the hale
<Canadian_Brony> one of the hales is Fluttershy
<Canadian_Brony> with an OP minigun
<oni_link|sick> lol
<Quick_Thinker> fuck it im plaiyng this song as well in class and see what other kids think then say its from MLP FIM see if they change thier opinion
<Canadian_Brony> and this plays
<Sumica> 00,10best to not force it on otheres Quick_Thinker
<thisguy> dat song + fluttershy's voice = <3 :)
<Sumica> 00,10many fans are ones that just gave in on there own and decided to see waht it was all about
<KJ> what happened?
<Mozdoc> For some reason the part where Fluttershy is whining and shaking her head doesn't look right to me since the eyes stay fixiated looking straight...
<DeadpoolDash> pony converting is a touchy subject for most
<Kencolt> Sumica: I know. Saw stuff about it? Got curious, noticed I had the Hub, watched a few eps... and here this old man is.
<KJ> e we go
<Sumica> 00,10it's how I converted
<Quick_Thinker> i did not "give in" i saw it on youtube and thought well i loved Power Puff and Fosters so lets see what Laurens been doing. Then well loved it
<Quick_Thinker> but what happened strangely it passed by me quickly
<Sumica> 00,10saw a saturation of it for months
<NocturnalBlade> party soft
<Sumica> 00,10finaly asked wtf it was about
<Ponies47> I'm going to be doing on how cartoons have changed through out the years. I can't just focus on MLP FiM but my plans are I will include atleast a paragraph about the whoel brony thing and such :3
<Sumica> 00,10got an anser figured meh
<Quick_Thinker> then when i was felling "blue" i by some luck found SMILE SMILE SMILE and "blues" GONE
<Ponies47> *doing a report
<Sumica> 00,10later on youtube showed me anthology
<Kencolt> I can tell you one thing-- the work needed to make these models is scary.
<Quick_Thinker> Ponies47 i did a speech on bronies in school
<Quick_Thinker> its entitled
<Quick_Thinker> Brony Speech in School
<DeadpoolDash> I cant even remember when i started watching
<Ponies47> Quick_Thinker: I wish I could do that. If I ever get the chance I will
<DeadpoolDash> this one is good
<Quick_Thinker> me either
<Canadian_Brony> I was pretty judgemental of the show, but didn't say anything out loud in respect for one of my awesome friends who was a brony.
<Quick_Thinker> it are broke
<Quick_Thinker> or not
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Same here. Heard about Derpy, got cruious, looked it up, got interested in the fact the animators put it as an easter egg for the fans, heard they actually called her Derpy, saw the chat reaction video, came here the next week and that was it
<Sumica> 00,10some day we might just see sfm being used for pony eps
<Kencolt> Oh, yeah... How to totally misunderstand orders.
<thisguy> woot :)
<Canadian_Brony> and suddenly Pinkie Pie

<Blitzwing> What is this witchcraft you speak of?
<Sumica> 00,10nice duckface super
<J_E_Smith71> Hey Sumica you guys wanted a banner timer, why not just stick Pony Countdown's banner up there above the chat? http://ponycountdown.com/
<TheRandomkid321> Just before I leave to play tekkit. Does anyone want to join me? It's okay if not.
<NocturnalBlade> Blitzwing: you shall see lol
<Quick_Thinker> i got a drink from Andrew Francis (not beer silly fill :3)
<Kencolt> Sumica: Actually, I'm not fond of FiW. Guess age has rendered it's humor stale to me. Well, that and I'm the resident old fart, so I have to have something to gripe about.
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica well, if you don't know what "Pinkie's Gypsy Bard" is and you can say "Raincloud" without feeling slightly emotional, either you haven't watched FiW or you simply don't care for it that much (such as myself).
<Sumica> 00,10yeah J_E_Smith71 it's not a simple stick it in
<twilight_sprinkle> idk, i love fiw
<Sumica> 00,10needs to be formated to fit else it looks like ass

<Kencolt> The first time I ever heard this song-- believe it or not-- was an anime music video about Sailor Mercury.
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: But didn't you have something like that already back in Season2? Why not just reuse whatever banner you had back then?
<Vordox> Sumica: OH! Sumi! Have you seen Hellsing IX yet?
