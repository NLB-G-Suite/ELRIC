<Kencolt> This tune doesn't really work in dub.
<Dester> flutter-emo
<AJIsAwesome> I honestly don't mine.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's wasting the fact that you're in a video stream
<AJIsAwesome> *mind
<CrimsonPhoenix> not a radio
<Dashee> Which pony is that on the right?
<flutterchu> i dont want to be an emo anymore
<Master-Derps> pankreas yh i 99% sure its party with pinkie
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: :(
<FlutterMEDIC> RAWRity: i want to save that Luna <:'(
<RAWRity> it's likely a result of being familiar with too many wannabe goth girls in high school, but I absolutely hate the Pink/black combo.
<DerpyMuffins> Flutterbhitch Dashee
<Cades[Phone]> how much is he gonna charge you?
<DerpDash> Whoever listened to this song and made a pirate remix was insanely creative
<Kimori> $150 I think..
<RAWRity> like, every time I see it, I want to punch the person who made it.
<KernelCobb> ohai dash
<Kimori> No might be $200
<FlutterMEDIC> obye dash
<Bluemario2> hi dashie
<Cades[Phone]> You know if thats cheap?
<Kimori> hell yeah
<twilight_sprinkle> emo fluttershy seems like a more interesting character
<Cades[Phone]> awesome :p
<KernelCobb> RAWRity: hasbro made it orignally
<RAWRity> >emo
<RAWRity> >interesting
<Kimori> He showed me what the computer says he should charge
<Eli> RAWRity: i think it doesn't fit her coat and eyes, but it's not that bad a combo otherwise
<twilight_sprinkle> >yes
<Kimori> Its much higher than that price
<RAWRity> That's one hell of a way to misspell irritating
<Epsilon> >lol guise im implying xddd
<pony_3731> Yo ho yo ho it's a PONY's life for me
<twilight_sprinkle> >lol Epsilon
<KernelCobb> RAWRity: http://atomicgreymon.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-Emo-Magazine-Cover-201547501

<Mozdoc> German. The angry language.
<DerpyMuffins> Since when can Luna chant a chorus?
<Eli> Mozdoc: it's not!
<KernelCobb> DerpyMuffins: since forever
<AJIsAwesome> I'm trying to see if I can master the Soldier.

<Derpy_Hooves> for those of you who don't know: in this song Gangnam style is about how korean women should be treated with alot of respect because of what they do

<Spectrum_Rush> HOORAY
<FlutterMEDIC> flutterchu: he wasnt in G2
<flutterchu> i hope there's no gen 4.5
<KernelCobb> how is she going to raise the sun?
<CrimsonPhoenix> dahling count: 5
<HiImSpike> princess myseria ....
<XAX> Gangnam is a huge city in Korea that's like Hollywood. Gangnam Style is making fun of how the classy people love in that city. ...at least that's what I was told.
<flutterchu> flutterchu: )~(
<Kandarihu> I heard someone claim that Oppan Gangnam Style was about ridiculing the upper-class. Yeah right.
<Hat> Then she becomes a queen and everyone hates her
<KernelCobb> ^ the end
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu, that could be CMC spin-off
<XAX> live in that city*
<Maid_RainBow> i am going to hit the hay now
<Derpy_Hooves> i actually like g3 spike
<Derpy_Hooves> i like his design

<AJIsAwesome> Night Maid_RainBow
<brony90> bye there
<KernelCobb> goodnight Maid_RainBow
<jojoyasmin> 7 Darlings now, right?
<Hat> Are these bugponies
<KernelCobb> Derpy_Hooves: he's good in his own right.
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: Unfortunately, I do too.
<somepony_else> good night Maid_RainBow
<Bluemario2> eeeeyup
<HiImSpike> Hat: If celestia came things are going to go down
<howdyx> Night Maid_RainBow
<FlutterMEDIC> Hat: Breezies
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu, G4.5 could be a CMC spin-off
<Hat> Lol
<flutterchu> CrimsonPhoenix: i beleve i understand now
<cowvarkian> ok. who requested ponies
<KernelCobb> que LoZ chest
<Kandarihu> To think that G3 Spike is just G4 Spike a thousand years later gives off Gunbuster vibes.
<howdyx> SOILDIER
<flutterchu> THERE GONNA MAKE A FUCKING GEN4.5 :'(
<KernelCobb> perhaps G3 is AFTER G4
<Derpy_Hooves> AJIsAwesome: i like how he walks with his claws behind his back, he's like a butler :3
<KernelCobb> timeline twist!
<Applejack2011> I think I requested
<cowvarkian> <.<
<XAX> flutterchu: And?
<flutterchu> KernelCobb: gen 4........never ends T_T
<brony90> pewdiepie just uploaded a new vid guys.. brb
<Derpy_Hooves> pewdiepie is overrated
<flutterchu> brony90: oh boy
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: He would make an interesting alternate Spike if he had some more personality.
<Derpy_Hooves> chuggaconroy all the way
<cowvarkian> twiddlie wink, tra la la....
<cowvarkian> seems legit
<KernelCobb> flutterchu: but in g4, spike is no more than 15 years old...can't be..g3 he's over 1000 years
<FlutterMEDIC> ANOTHER DAMN SONG
<Hat> I see a tra la la
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry, I prefer NCS.
<DashWithRainbows> Derpy_Hooves He used to be good when he had about 300k subs.
<CrimsonPhoenix> brony90, is it wrong for me to not care about pewdiepie at all?
<AJIsAwesome> Chugga's too annoying for me.
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: I don't care about him, so no
<d3rb> CrimsonPhoenix, not at all, thats normal
<DashWithRainbows> As soon as he started acting more like a child, he gained more subs.
<AJIsAwesome> He's still a good lper, though.
<Derpy_Hooves> DashWithRainbows AJIsAwesome: but if you two are asking for my personal fav, i prefer pcull44444
<Kencolt> Ok. Song? Check. Lyrics? Check. VA who can't sing worth a half a damn? Double Check.
<Applejack2011> dat Spike song
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: IKR? :S
<HiImSpike> I thank celestia that gen3.5 was not sucessful
<somepony_else> ikr AJIsAwesome
<KernelCobb> I think G3 spike is the only good thing to come from this movie
<DerpyMuffins> Chuuga is kinda offensive to British people
<Kandarihu> CrimsonPhoenix, I don't mind if you don't care about pewdiepie
<flutterchu> never mind it's not a happy wheels video
<Applejack2011> me too Kernel
<DashWithRainbows> Derpy_Hooves Never heard of him, I'm more of a Robbaz fan :P
<Hat> I like FiM songs because they have some purpose in the story
<flutterchu> i want to see him play the new character
<CrimsonPhoenix> I loved chuggaconroy when he did Earthbound
<AJIsAwesome> I got sick of Chugga when he started yelling everything.
<pony_2508> herp der this is the wrong pony duuuhhhh i want real pony. dis dumb
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Agreed.
<cowvarkian> Hat: and because they have good singing?
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: ONe of his best LP's, IMO.
<Bluemario2> hey, aleast it's not the biggest teaparty ever live show
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, and his first
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Yep.
<somepony_else> chugga is pretty annoying
<cowvarkian> Bluemario2: that shit is hilarious
<Hat> cowvarkian: the quality too, but in this show it's just filling the quota
<d3rb> its not about the lps its all about the rps :P
<Applejack2011> biggest teaparty noo

<Sinestro> so you notice everyone on steam, and then you give me this
<KernelCobb> I would like to declare this movie not shit
<XylemTube> Fuck off spike!
<cowvarkian> KernelCobb: declaration declined
<Barbetos> Suddenly you are transported to equestria
<KernelCobb> :S
<Barbetos> And this is what you get.
<Barbetos> Enjoy.
<d3rb> spike..just shut up
<cowvarkian> minty?
<DerpyMuffins> If you seen Fluttershy, you seen a pink leaf tree
<Hat> Every time a pony has a baby it starts a new pony generation
<Dark_Horst> ...what did i come back to?
<Applejack2011> Pink apple tree is AJ
<Barbetos> Dragons don't touch princesses.
<cowvarkian> Hat: I believe this
<HiImSpike> i miss unicorns and pegasi
<cowvarkian> Hat: wait
<Sinestro> so whats after the joke of a show?
<spitfirecolt> this needs a riff trax guys
<Dark_Horst> dat laugh
<AJIsAwesome> How did they find this enjoyable for children? I'm pretty sure 80% of kids watching it stopped WAY before this part.
<d3rb> more g3 hopefully Sinestro
<Barbetos> Why does it need a riff trax? Its cool.
<Applejack2011> hope for more g3 too
<cowvarkian> d3rb: I'd like sinestro in g3
<Hat> I am getting sick of the word princess
<Sinestro> wat
<Barbetos> Not darling?
<cowvarkian> daaaaaaaaahling
<jojoyasmin> Ew. Their laugh....
<Bluemario2> and.......when is there going to a hint of moral in this story?
<Hat> This is so unrainbow
<Applejack2011> those overused words
<FlutterMEDIC> too...much...dahling...
<Dark_Horst> you. are not. rainbow das
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dahling count: 17
<Dark_Horst> h
<XylemTube> G3 Rainbow sucks
<HiImSpike> Wait the town is consisting of 11 ponies
<Barbetos> you are fine with princess, but Darling Dash is okay.
<cowvarkian> G3 everything sucks
<KernelCobb> she needs to go dash a rainbow
<Barbetos> not fine
<d3rb> g3 is best g
<cowvarkian> d3rb: >.>
<d3rb> :P
<HiImSpike> cowvarkian: not as bad as 3.5 its x.x
<AJIsAwesome> The way Spike is pushing her around and giving her orders, I see him as a leader more than her.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dahling count: 18
<jojoyasmin> 20 Darlings...
<Barbetos> but it was not good enough, so you are out when G4 rolls around.
<cowvarkian> HiImSpike: true facts
<AJIsAwesome> Then burn it. Burn the flower.
*alexxm kidnaps HiImSpike
<cowvarkian> <.<
<AJIsAwesome> DAT KIDNAPPING
<GabeMoist> Our princess is in another castle
<cowvarkian> hah
<Hat> Is he still a baby dragon
<HiImSpike> :O
<XylemTube> this rainbow lacks the I'm better than everybody attitude... bad
<Kencolt> OK. Let me get this straight... a pony digs up a lizard with a flower, and the lizard says, "You're a princess now", and EVERYPONY JUST BUYS IT. Without any question. Except for the Princess.
<KernelCobb> AJIsAwesome: can't burn it...'tis magic
<cowvarkian> Hat: no, he's just a midget
<AJIsAwesome> KernelCobb: *sigh* :(
<Hat> D:
<QT_Marks> oh...hey everyone.
<AJIsAwesome> Kencolt: IKR? :|
<Dark_Horst> Kencolt: g3-wonderland
<AJIsAwesome> Hi QT_Marks
<d3rb> hey QT_Marks
<IshHamsterJelly> oh noes
<Applejack2011> hi
<HiImSpike> hey QT_Marks
<Sinestro> rulebook, guy pestering someone, loony support. its like Space Jam borrowed from this
<alexxm> how are things QT_Mark
<IshHamsterJelly> nononononononononononononononononononononononononoooooo
<Mozdoc> Is Pinkie Pie trying to make an ice cream float with real ice cream?
<QT_Marks> well, i guess good. what with this show on
<KernelCobb> This world's government sucks
<cowvarkian> KernelCobb: this is a government?
<DerpyMuffins> Rainbow berry juice?
<QT_Marks> this show
<spitfirecolt> what are they pegasus faries
<DerpyMuffins> There is a flavor called rainbow berry?
<KernelCobb> cowvarkian: my point exactly
<Dark_Horst> ...what the fuck did her nose just do???
<Barbetos> I want to punch spike in the face
<IshHamsterJelly> which mod is trolling us?
<Sinestro> every girls show seems to forgit that a princess usally means a ruling Monarchy. not exactly modern or fair.
<jojoyasmin> DerpyMuffins: Seems legit
<cowvarkian> IshHamsterJelly: caramel
<CrimsonPhoenix> FUCK THE POLICE
<KernelCobb> oh
<Applejack2011> dat troll spike
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chat, what did you do to get G3 on stream?
<Barbetos> Oh no
<IshHamsterJelly> y Caramel, yyyyyy!!!
<DerpyMuffins> Ask Caramel
<cowvarkian> Nittany_Discord: I don't know, wasnt here
<Barbetos> Princesses don't say Darling.
<CrimsonPhoenix> 19
<Facecake> We didn't do anything
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: Nothing. Nothing at all. :D
<Barbetos> Thats for sure.
<twilight_sprinkle> dahling bow bahling
<Caramel> 2,14 Darling, I just really like it, Darling
<HiImSpike> g3 spike go back where you came from and bring g4 spike out
<Kandarihu> Well, a princess is NEXT IN LINE to be the ruling monarchy. The actual ruler is the queen.
<QT_Marks> Dawling
<cowvarkian> Caramel: I hear you like dahling so I put dahling with your dahling to make it more dahling
<DerpyMuffins> What makes it royal?
<KernelCobb> Spike has a mother..
<HiImSpike> dawlception
<Barbetos> Yep. Voilently murdered by the humans
<Barbetos> Some ass hole named Dovahkin
<AJIsAwesome> Brb.
<Dovah> wha?
<HiImSpike> spike..... whats tha matta
<cowvarkian> a few generations
<Dovah> dat ping
<Kandarihu> Spike's only mother was Twilight Sparkle, and she died of natural causes.
<XylemTube> I just got here, why is G3 on?
<cowvarkian> XylemTube: because caramel
<d3rb> XylemTube, because its awesome
<IshHamsterJelly> and this was the precursor to spike wanting to bang rarity in the gen 4
<Hat> Every time he wakes up he has to meet new ponies
<Dovah> XylemTube: cuz it can be
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: Tell that to Celestia, Luna, and Cadence.
<Applejack2011> because of me
<HiImSpike> XylemTube: because it is:D
<Sinestro> trolling
<Applejack2011> because of trolls
<DerpyMuffins> lol
<KernelCobb> Kandarihu: die?
<DerpyMuffins> Spike just trolling
<Hat> SPIIIKE
<cowvarkian> princess of ponyville?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But Ponyville is a democracy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Dark_Horst> rape him
<HiImSpike> cowvarkian: yeah
<Kencolt> He never met Luna, has he?\
<spitfirecolt> u guys think candence will give up her immortality to be with shining armor
<XylemTube> I'll give G3 props, Spike isin't as dumb as he is in G4
<KernelCobb> cowvarkian: yes, canterlot was destroyed long ago
<cowvarkian> HiImSpike: I don't even
<KernelCobb> it's been a thousand years, anyway
<KernelCobb> without a princess
<IshHamsterJelly> she can't be princess, she doesn't have a horn and wings
<KernelCobb> wtf happened...
<Hat> Spike, forever a pony
<XylemTube> wat
<DerpyMuffins> Dat 4th wall
<Sinestro> oh god, if they reuse this story in G4
<Kandarihu> Just going by my own fanfic concept. Celestia is assasinated, Luna dies in the ensuing war, and Cadence was never immortal to begin with and dies naturally
<QT_Marks> share that secret, between the 2 of you
<Rex_Mundi> Oh God its G3!
<HiImSpike> someones happy
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: implying she has no progeny?
<DashWithRainbows> >Open stream
<Dark_Horst> cadance isnt immortal, we clearly saw her age from flashback to now
<DashWithRainbows> >G3 ponies
<XylemTube> Sinestro: that would be interesting, becuase thaen it would actually be good.
<sing_song> What did we walk into?
<MirrorImage> DashWithRainbows- inorite?
<Dark_Horst> twilight livespan
<DashWithRainbows> VAAAAAALLLL
<XylemTube> did they just say Trololol?
<Barbetos> No. Really. Die in a fire! I insist!
<KernelCobb> Kandarihu: there needs to be a fanfic from spike's point of view on how G4 ponyville evolved into this movie's ponyville
<Bluemario2> never learn'd
<Dester> How mutch longer is this movie?
<Syn_Virtu> yeah lol i think so
<FlutterMEDIC> XylemTube: Tralala...
<Kandarihu> Oh. Okay. If Cadence has progeny, she/he will not be a winged pegasus.
<spitfirecolt> cadence is immortal all alicorns are
<QT_Marks> this is a movie? ? ? :(
<AJIsAwesome> spitfirecolt: No.
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: so, how did cadence come to exist?
<AJIsAwesome> spitfirecolt: They never said that in the show.
<Bluemario2> yup
<QT_Marks> nothing is happening
<Hat> Every time Spike goes to sleep he regenerates into a new form and a different Ponyville from a thousand years
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Darling.
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, genetic mutation.
<CrimsonPhoenix> 22
<jojoyasmin> A straight to DVD movie at that
<Sinestro> its been argued Celest/Luna are the only immortials. others are just lesser alicorns
<spitfirecolt> celestia is 3000 yrs old
<QT_Marks> the darling has been doubled
<KernelCobb> Nittany_Discord: dahling*
<AJIsAwesome> spitfirecolt: Only Celestia and Luna are reported as immortal.
<Dark_Horst> those pixie thingies are actually kinda cute. if only their colors werent so evilly pastel
<twilight_sprinkle> bow before me, peasants!
<Barbetos> There is a little wire, in my brain, that shorts when that pony says darling. Just her. It is telling me to murder things.
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: I'm pretty sure that that genetic mutation would also be a dominant one, ensuing in all of her female children to therefore be alicorns
<Kandarihu> KernelCobb, I thought of that, but it would make it too similar to another story I'm cooking up that is not pony related and that I want to realize as more than just text.
<KernelCobb> that lip-sync
<XylemTube> spitfirecolt: hmmm I always thought she was only 1000 fo some reason
<Rex_Mundi> spitfirecolt: My theory is that Celestia and Luna are special, even by alicorn standards, and Cadance is much more of a normal pony, even though alicorns are still extreamly rare.
<spitfirecolt> and that makes cadence immortal too see she is family
<CrimsonPhoenix> 23
<Caramel> 2,14 so yes....G4 will be after this...hehehehe....hehehee
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We need one male alicorn in the show.
<DerpyMuffins> They have cars in Equestria?
<Hat> Red and black with stripes
<d3rb> its canon, first princess
<somepony_else> i've got a really bad feeling about this
<Applejack2011> yes for more alicorns in G4 ;)
<Rex_Mundi> Nittany_Discord: Agreed, and not an evil one too.
<Barbetos> Guys... I think Caramel has finally snaped.
<cowvarkian> Nittany_Discord: I don't want male alicorns, it destroys my hypothesis
<Barbetos> I blame you all for this
<Dark_Horst> Caramel: ...whyyyyyy does that laughing make me dread the near future?
<XylemTube> Nittany_Discord: nope Instead we get prince Blueblood
<KernelCobb> Rex_Mundi: according to a bioligy major, allicorns are more common than the show implies. genetics and such...
<Dester> DerpyMuffins yes, well, no, well we have seen one, one that also makes cider
<KernelCobb> PRINCESS PINKIE PIE?!
<Sinestro> still lost, if shes princess, wheres Queen, King? even if she was a newly crowned Princess with no Queen she would automaticly be the new Queen
<XylemTube> IT PARTY TIME
<FlutterMEDIC> WHAT FUCKERY IS THIS
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, it's more like the kind of genetic mutation that allows two-headed turtles to exist. It's a one-in-a-million genetic quirk.
<AJIsAwesome> spitfirecolt: First off: She is technially family only because she's married. Second: If she's immortal, there's no real point for her to get married since Shining Armor will die. There are probably Alicorns that aren't immortal.
<KernelCobb> PARTY ALL THE TIME
<Sinestro> fucking girl logic hating on the Queen title
<CrimsonPhoenix> DAHLING
<FlutterMEDIC> AGAIN, WHAT FUCKERY IS THIS
<KernelCobb> wait...
<Hat> Princess Utter Tyranny... actually, not everyone gets to be one
<Barbetos> Caramel why not a nice relaxing game or murder robots instead? I mean Mann Vs Machine.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hail Princess Rainbow Dash!
<DerpyMuffins> If Pinkie is a Princess, this world is fucked up
<Barbetos> of*
<QT_Marks> Errybody a princess
<Applejack2011> So many princess
<Caramel> 2,14 Spike is a Princess <3
<Dester> If everypony is a pincess, isn't their no ruler?
<cowvarkian> brb
<spitfirecolt> well the show needs a history episode
<doctor_whooves127> wow
<Dark_Horst> oh shut up spike
<Kandarihu> And the only reason it happened twice in a generation with Celestia and Luna is because Discord ruled the world at the time.
<Rex_Mundi> KernelCobb: I think Alicorns are more special than simple genetics.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Princess Spike!
<KernelCobb> spike is high king
<FlutterMEDIC> NO, NO MORE SONGS
<AJIsAwesome> ANOTHER obligatory song? :|
<HiImSpike> Nothing evil happened after
<Bluemario2> the thing that people call, " the bottom of the barrel"
<XylemTube> This song blows
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat blanket
<Dark_Horst> it was bearable UNTIL FUCKING NOW!!!
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Kandarihu> Sunnydays, that's not quite a bad name.
<MaxTheBrony> what did i come back to?
<spitfirecolt> we will find out in season 3
<doctor_whooves127> when every one is a princess no one is
<Rex_Mundi> G3 neads Tirak to show up and wrek shit up G1 style.
<Dark_Horst> i wish them a horrible death, all of them
<FlutterMEDIC> this song just wants to make me vomit
<Caramel> 2,14 ~For tomorrow Spring is here~
<AJIsAwesome> Caramel: No. :(
<KernelCobb> Rex_Mundi: there was a 4th alicorn appearance, but it was during a hallucination. probably just a animation error, but still.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everyone in chat is a princess now.
<Sinestro> muted until over
<Applejack2011> S3 needs more princess
<Sinestro> it burns
*AJIsAwesome is now a princess? :(
<QT_Marks> YAY i'm a princess
<Dester> So no one is a princess!
<Bluemario2> but I'm a man!
<Dester> becuase everyone is!
<KernelCobb> Rex_Mundi: Celestia might be having them all destroyed
<Princess> Hoorah
<Princess_Hat> Aw yeah
<Dark_Horst> i'm a princess!
<Kandarihu> They have just smashed PAST the fourth wall
<Sumica> 00,10raceest earth ponies

<Kencolt> That's not really proper gvernmental procedure.
<Sinestro> now we get some real pony
<Rosfox> Aren't I such a pretty princess
<Hawkie> dem eyes
<Barbetos> That song. Take a dump on your hand, smear it around a bit on your wall, and you get the aesthetic equivalent of it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dester: Yep.
<XylemTube> IT'S OVER \o/
<Princess_Hat> We need to recalibrate
<Sinestro> G2 cough
<Bluemario2> FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUU

<Dester> .1/10
<Bluemario2> yes to the real ones!
<QT_Marks> what a great movie!
<Bluemario2> lol
<crazypony> -10/10
<PrincesKandarihu> One s for me... hang on
<KernelCobb> Rex_Mundi: biologicaly, the chance for an alicorn is like 1/64..
<XylemTube> That is NOT RD/10
<Dester> fact: spcae does not exist
<Rex_Mundi> And thus the vaule of being a princess has been inflated worse than college majors

<Hat> I like Duck
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> How?
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<Meanwhile> Dude wanted help with grammar.
<AdamTheDuck> I like hats :P
<Reikim> Well thank God he found someone else to do it.
<Meanwhile> Which is the least of the problems concerning that literary abomination.
<Reikim> Good to know I was completely and totally justified.
<Reikim> Some way, somehow, FIVE OTHER PREREADERS managed to miss those tense shifts.
<Reikim> I mean, how? How does an atrocity like that happen?
<Sumica> 00,10refresh
<Hawkie> these multi-cellular lifeform have done some intersting things
<brony90> iÂ´m out.. bye
<KernelCobb> bye brony90
<AdamTheDuck> Bye brony90
<Meanwhile> Given the exact caliber of writing we're talking about here I don't put much stock in the folks this guy hangs around with often enough to trust them to read his fanfics.
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<Princess_Discord> 11,01Stream's up. Cut the video links out.
<Reikim> ...D'awwwww
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight GilDash
<Bluemario2> k
<KernelCobb> OMFG ADORABLE
<KernelCobb> aww
<Reikim> So yeah, now you know.
<MaxTheBrony> Night GilDash
<AdamTheDuck> So much adorableness!~
<Meanwhile> I mean the grammar is atrocious but the story itself is just terribly bad.
<Kandarihu> Ah, Digimon!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Digimon? YEEEEEEEEEEES
<Bluemario2> what are you guys talking abou-oh ok
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<MaxTheBrony> so cute video :3
<Meanwhile> You know the phrase "lavender mare" appeared 7 times in chapter 1?
<DerpyMuffins> Digimon again?
<Reikim> Please don't remind me please don't remind me
<Bluemario2> daaaaaw.
<KernelCobb> well, this showed never appealed to me, so i'm off to play some DC Universe online
<DerpyMuffins> What G is it?
<Kandarihu> We're back to Mips
<KernelCobb> goodbye bronies!
<Kandarihu> DerpyMuffins, this is G1
<Meanwhile> I mean good grief, is the guy familiar with the concept of a Thesaurus?
<Reikim> Somehow I ended up the go-to guy for helping him.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah memories lol the jp op is better :D
<cowvarkian> I was going to leave, but then i realized digimon
<Reikim> With plot, anyway.
<Reikim> I get the feeling he has gotten zero criticism except from EQD, who basically said "this is unreadable we're not going to bother the main prereaders"
<Meanwhile> There's no pacing, no setup, the thinnest of connections, it's just...urgh.
<MaxTheBrony> Good bye KernelCobb
<Reikim> I trust you gave him the news in your usual tactful fashion.
<cowvarkian> but yeah, I'll be back later
<Reikim> Oh hey look it's that other show I never got to watch as a child!
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Jet Blue Recieves Jet Blue Pony!
<Meanwhile> I told him that sorting the grammar out was something to do after everything else is fixed.
<Reikim> Well that's one way to look at it.
<Reikim> The way I saw it was basically "fix his grammar, let the EQD prereaders tear him apart"
<XylemTube> yay it's subbed\
<Kandarihu> I don't think I can focus on video games and anime at the same time
<Mozdoc> How is Prince-Dari so plugged in to EQD to automatically post whenever something new occurs?

<AdamTheDuck> Nittany_Discord, yes yes yes!~
<Meanwhile> Pfft. Herdmind.
*DoctoDoctorWho smells the horrific stench of a sheer pokemon ripoff
<DerpyMuffins> Train?
<DashWithRainbows> SaxyPretender Might want to get the Mod repels.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>Digimon
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>pokemon ripoff
<Lyra`> is it wrong that i think that matt has a nice ass?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14....
<DerpyMuffins> Digimon and Pokemon are so alike
<Reikim> I was under the impression they were two distinct series.
<Lyra`> lies
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Digimon came out FIRST.
<Lyra`> and BS
<AdamTheDuck> Maybe Lyra` , maybe. :D
<MadSurge> Obvious trap is obvious
<Buytoast> Are you really that surprised SaxyPretender?
<Kandarihu> SaxyPretender, it's different enough. There's no collecting of Digimon
<JESmith71> DoctoDoctorWho: That had an actual plot and got darker in its later seasons than Pokemon
<Lyra`> SaxyPretender knows the score!
<Buytoast> Are you really?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I shouldn't be, but I am.
<DerpyMuffins> Digimon got the anime and Pokemon got the games
<DoctoDoctorWho> SaxyPretender: what year did it debue?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like...'96?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14To wikipedia!
<Buytoast> i believe digimon was 95-96
<Reikim> Maner number one: Digimon trainers get one Mon and train it with love. Pokemon trainers are obsessive-compulsives with a penchant for collection and organization.
<Reikim> *manner
<Meanwhile> The fact that folks with that level of writing ability decide that it's worth showing the internet baffles me.
<Sumica> 00,10Digimon also has games
<DoctoDoctorWho> SaxyPretender: pokemon debued first in 96
<Sumica> 00,10they just were on the wonder swan
<Kandarihu> I'm getting a lot of buffering.
<Sumica> 00,10a hand held that never got US marketing
<Reikim> The other advice I gave was "go read something that isn't crap"
<MadSurge> It's so weird to see the monsters talk...
<Lyra`> also, pokemon are trained through some kind of gladiator system reminicent of roman times, only thing missing is the man rape and woman abuse
<JESmith71> The Digimon virtual pet things were in the US before Pokemon
<flutterchu> i beleve were watching digimon right now *afraid to click the unpause button*
<Reikim> To be fair, though (on the grammatical end at least) I'm pretty sure English isn't his first language.
<Reikim> No excuse on the plot level, though.
<DoctoDoctorWho> SaxyPretender: so the issue still stands as to which series came out first in that year
<Sumica> 00,10you are on the wrong embed any ways flutterchu
<Lyra`> digimon
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, those wondersawn games explain Ryo's presence in Adventure 02 and Tamers
<MadSurge> Lyra`: you mean that Digimon don't learn through fighting?
<Sumica> 00,10yep SaxyPretender
<flutterchu> Sumica: pika pi?
<Meanwhile> It's not. Which frankly ownly confuses me further.
<Lyra`> adventure 02 was AWESOME!
<Reikim> Apparently in later chapters he turns it into a comedy, or something. I don't know, I couldn't get past the first chapter.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Lyra`> they learn without fighting
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> Meanwhile.
<Reikim> You made a grammar mistake.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I actually plan on naming my first born son Davis
<Meanwhile> I'm tired, give me a break.
<JESmith71> Tamers was sweet
<Reikim> This is testamony to the sheer badness of this.
<DoctoDoctorWho> SaxyPretender: so did u find which came first?
<Lyra`> but there is fighting too, but usually int he defense of something, where as pokemon fight for the entertainment or honor of their trainer
<Reikim> If it can give you a grammatical error, then it has hit a legendary level of bad.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eh, got too lazy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Digimon to watch :3
<MadSurge> But entertainment is fuuuun~
<Cypresswolf> Gabumon's pelt = Edd's Hat
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...dat smooth jazz
<FlutterMEDIC> Cypresswolf: dat logic
<DoctoDoctorWho> I MUST TAKE ON THIS QUEST MYSELF THEN
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: I thought your first three children were going to be named Oppan, Gangnam and Style?
<flutterchu> is somnthing streaming
<Lyra`> besides my logic is thesis worthy :3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Nope.
<Meanwhile> I managed to read chapter 2.
<flutterchu> HOORAY
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I liked Gangnam Style, but not that much =P
<Meanwhile> But by the end of it I was getting a headache.
<JESmith71> flutterchu: Refesh if you're on LimeV we're on Mips again
<Sumica> 00,10good guy matt
<Bluemario2> lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah, Matt and T.K., I'll hate your guts come next season ^_^
<Reikim> Well, you have a stronger tolerance for BS than I do.
<Lyra`> but for now theyre cute :3
<Lyra`> oof, look at that blush <3
<MadSurge> This kid needs a lesson in manners :|
<Reikim> On the subject of English not being his first language, though...I can actually understand that.
<Sumica> 00,10ok I can see hateing TK but why matt?
<Lyra`> jealouse of his nice ass
<Lyra`> obv
<Reikim> People publish things to get attention. In all fandoms - and especially this one - English is generally the language of choice.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Shipping reasons and that's all I'll say.
<Kandarihu> Am I seriously the only one who's getting lag?
<Sumica> 00,10ahhhh
<Reikim> It's stupid but there's logic behind it.
<Lyra`> oooof
<MadSurge> Lyra`: that's why Pokemon works better as a game rather than an anime :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14For Digimon, I am a UPS worker.
<Lyra`> i read sooo many ship fics for digimon <3
<Buytoast> didn't sora end up dumping tai so she could jump matt's bones or something?
<Sumica> 00,10you wanted tai to get the girl
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Yes, Sumica.
<Meanwhile> True, but he can't be blind to how lacking his story is. Why draw attention to /that/ of all things.
<flutterchu> pokemon first airing date April 1, 1997 | digimon first airing date March 7, 1999 | pokemon came first TAKE THAT BITCH
<MadSurge> AND THEN
<Buytoast> AHAHA
<flutterchu> sorry i eman
<Buytoast> hot damn you're stupid
<flutterchu> TAKE THAT
<Kandarihu> Right when that red surface reacted to the fire, buffer
<Bluemario2> uh oh
<Buytoast> anime wasn't the first incarnation
<Meanwhile> March is before April...
<Bluemario2> lol
<flutterchu> Meanwhile: check the year
<MadSurge> GIANT WATER DRAGON
<Reikim> He isn't.
<Reikim> Wait
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat Seadramon
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh hey
<Reikim> I mean
<Reikim> he is.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Seadramon
<Dark_Horst> we have digimon and nobody tells me? what the HELL people??
<Hat> http://i.imgur.com/Jze21.gif
<Reikim> He is quite literally blind to how bad the story is.
<Cypresswolf> I want to find my old digimon games now...I know I still have 3 for ps1 - I hated that loading screen
<Kandarihu> Okay. I just refreshed on the first eyecatch and didn't find myself moving too much ahead. We're all lagged like this, we gotta be
<Sumica> 00,10anime did not come first flutterchu
<Buytoast> so flutterchu, you realize that the animes came out later than the actual thing right?
<Meanwhile> Well that's even more discouraging.
<Buytoast> how embarrasing
<MadSurge> Hat: aww, did I miss that? :D
<Reikim> I've been trying to say it nicely for days now.
<JESmith71> Seadramon evolved from Horseamon
<flutterchu> Buytoast: T_T
<Bluemario2> lol
<Hat> MadSurge, it was very traumatising be glad you weren't there
<Reikim> However, with each time I get locked into a PM convo with him, I despair more and more that it will be possible.
<Meanwhile> You're in despair.
<Reikim> This fanfic has put me in despair.
<DerpyMuffins> Power lines.....
<DerpyMuffins> In water....
<MadSurge> Hat: BUT I LOVE G3/LIVE SHOW TROLLING ;__;
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Seadramon giving no fucks
<MadSurge> YOU'RE JUST PISSING IT OFF
<Kandarihu> There is a distinction between Pokemon and Digimon. Pokemon are the wildlife of the world in which they inhabit. Digimon are the intelligent population of their world.
<Dark_Horst> Derpy_Hooves: seeing the extreme state of disrepeair these powerlines are in, on would guess they werent always in the water
<DoctoDoctorWho> he's a virgin he gives so few fucks
<flutterchu> what the two pikachuz i mean what the- that's not pikachu the whooiiin on ze left iz pikatchu
<MadSurge> NOW HE FUCKED UP
<Lyra`> oppan gangnam style!
<Sumica> 00,10onichan
<Cypresswolf> Oniii-Chan = oniiii-chan - wonderful translation
<MadSurge> Sumica: exactly :D
<Dark_Horst> Derpy_Hooves: whoops. wrong ping
<Lyra`> im in my barracks room singing the crap out of that song, and my sgt starts banging on the door XD
<MadSurge> NOW HE FUCKED UP
<DerpyMuffins> How many Derpys are there?
<DoctoDoctorWho> onii-chan!
<DerpDash> Not enough
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, no point translating a word that the vast majority of anime fans know.
<Meanwhile> And then he died. The end
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Yaaaaaaay
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<MadSurge> JUST BECOME A GIANT MONSTER
<Dark_Horst> fuck shit up mode engaged
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Also, AWWWWWWW YEAH GIANT WOLF
<Reikim> ...Ouot of curiosity, was this anime one of the many that got fucked over by the dub?
<Cypresswolf> Gururumon <3
<Reikim> Because that would explain so much.
<Hat> He upgraded his firmware
<Dark_Horst> Reikim: yep
<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc, dub took out a lot of the music
<Sumica> 00,10not a fuck as some but yeah it suffed from locolsasion Reikim
<Dark_Horst> Reikim: heard the english dub once. never. again
<JESmith71> SaxyPretender: And it gets better when it turns into the GIANT WEREWOLF or the GINAT METALWOLF
<Kandarihu> Reikim, a general rule is that if the dub is meant for broadcast TV, it WILL get messed up
<DerpyMuffins> mythrill?
<flutterchu> OH FUCK THERE REALLY IS A STREAM
<SaxyPretender> 0,14though I haven't really seen the originals
<Reikim> And second: was it a 4kids dub?
<Sumica> 00,10the usealy thing like making some things more american
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, dammit dinner ;_______;
<JESmith71> Reikim: It was a Saban dub
<MadSurge> So "evolutions" are really power levels, unlike Pokemon where they are more like growing stages
<MaxTheBrony> good night everybrony! :)
<Sumica> 00,10no this was a Saban dub
<Hat> Bye MaxTheBrony
<Dark_Horst> i grew up with the german dubs. luckily, they were very close to the japanese original
<Reikim> So basically, I'm pretty sure that next time he bugs me I'm just going to be forced to tell him the truth, sans softening.
<Dark_Horst> the worst sing is what they did witht he soundtracks
<MadSurge> Am I getting it right?
<Lyra`> SaxyPretender|Dinner, tell me the story of your people
<Dark_Horst> *thing
<Kandarihu> Reikim, I don't think it was 4Kids. But it doesn't matter if it was 4Kids or not. It was made for broadcast TV. So I naturally watched it trying to guess what got messed up.
<Meanwhile> "You cannot write fiction"
<Kandarihu> The digivolution music absolutely rocking, I never guessed that
<Lyra`> group walks in and laughs from off screen
<Reikim> More or less.
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: I would have just turned off the soundtrack :D
<Lyra`> tentacle rape?
<Meanwhile> "In fact, it's a wonder you can write your own name"
<Hat> Seaponies
<Reikim> Actually, if I wanted to be really blunt...yeah, that would work.
<Bluemario2> lol
<Cypresswolf> *head desk* &&&
<Lyra`> same thing?
<Meanwhile> "Just...go live in a cave and never attempt to communicate anything through the written word"
<MadSurge> That monster looks ridiculous!
<Dark_Horst> so, will we take that up as a regular series in here now? please tell me we do
<Cypresswolf> Argh :| whatever number button has that darn up arrow looking thing
<Kandarihu> The OP/ED music rocking, I pretty much consider to be the norm. As is the use of silence when appropriate
<Hat> ...so everytime we want him to evolve... we have to get Yamato into trouble!
<Reikim> "You have zero talent with the English language. Please stop now before I am forced to trepan myself out of self-defense."
<Lyra`> not too hard
<Lyra`> didnt you notice th random harmonica
<JESmith71> Dark_Horst: Sumi ran the first two eps last night so hopefully yeah
<Lyra`> *the
<MadSurge> And then they all died. The end
<Lyra`> sounds like a lute
<Dark_Horst> Hat: naw, they learn how t proper cntrol that stuff later
<Lyra`> *flut
<Lyra`> *flute
<Eddmario> DIGIMON!
<Eddmario> Which episode # is this one?
<JESmith71> Eddmario: 3
<MadSurge> This music is too loud
<GabeMoist> WOAH
<Eddmario> Oh, it's the Japanese version...

<something> hi
<somepony_else> hi sub06905

<MadSurge> So when did Applejack become human?
<Meanwhile> Perhaps you could recommend something to read that he might take something from the writing style.
<sub06905> yesterday
<sub06905> :3
<AdamTheDuck> Hello sub06905
<Hat> Que?
<Meanwhile> Or at least demoralise him into stopping entirely.
<MadSurge> And started wearing pink hats? :D
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, that's not Applejack.
<GabeMoistmon> I can beat Meramon easily
<Hat> Mimi is the best character
<Dark_Horst> somepony_else: sorry, keep pinging the wrong people tonight
<flutterchu> i remember this one
<GabeMoistmon> Moist > fire

<flutterchu> you do know that an english version of this anime is on youtube -_-
<Lyra`> you should now feel a nervous energy in your chest, right around your sturnum
<Dark_Horst> flutterchu: yes we do
<Lyra`> FEEL MY POWER!
<JESmith71> flutterchu: Yeah but we're doing the JPN one cause that's how we roll
<Reikim> Gotta love those automatic reboots.

<flutterchu> JESmith71: sorry i was late
<Dark_Horst> flutterchu: becasue the english one is one of the worse dubs
<Dovah> flutterchu: BECAUSE ITS BETTER!
<Lyra`> u
<MadSurge> The streamer decides what he wants to stream. Dub or subtitles.
<Thrackerzod> what teh hel
<Sumica> 00,10flutterchu you do know this is dual audio
<Thrackerzod> oh pokemon clone
<Lyra`> um it was fox kids at the time

<Thrackerzod> No there boreing poitless and the bigest pokemon ripoff ive ever seen
<Cypresswolf> I dont think I ever saw any of the Digimon movies
<Reikim> XylemTube: Actually, yeah, that was definitely Diebuster. Watch Gunbuster first, though; I know Sumi streams it sometimes.
<MadSurge> Also I have no idea why they're in a jungle. Did they fall in the internet or something like that?
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: I don't think you're really missing anything.
<DerpyMuffins> Dat sudden change
<Meanwhile> It looked like a big ????
<Lyra`> the first digimon movie was really good Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> Next stop on our tour, the forest of irrelevant road signs, no pictures please
<sing_song> What just happend?
<Lyra`> i might enter that into the lottery next time :3
<Sumica> 00,10we just finished Gunbuster last night

<something> >_>
<Lyra`> serious question is serious!
<AJIsAwesome> Lyra`: It's great, if you can get by some weird fanservice.
<Hat> Why are they running through the forest
<Reikim> Lyra`: It's just plain awesome. Corny, in places, but loveably awesome.
<Lyra`> fanservice :3
<AJIsAwesome> Lyra`: The ending is FANTASTIC.
<Reikim> IT'S GAINAX! FANSERVICE ADDS TO OUR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!
<Dark_Horst> Lyra`: did i lag over something again? what ahppened?
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: Welcome Home. ;_____;
<flutterchu> dont stop pata pata
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: IKR? :'(
<something> :)
<Reikim> Gunbuster was the first anime to give me manly tears.
<MadSurge> HOW CONVENIENT
<sub06905> it points weast
<Dark_Horst> MAGNETS!
<Kandarihu> File Island is on the Grand Line, apparently
<something> :D
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: File island?
<MadSurge> SOMEWHERE IN THE INTERNEEEEEEET
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it's called "file island"
<AJIsAwesome> Okay
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, oh right. They're no longer there.
<MadSurge> Where are these kids' parent anyway?!
<something> just keep walking
<Sumica> 00,10it's still the introduce all the evolusions arc so it's still file island
<JESmith71> MadSurge: They got sucked out of the real world and into the digital world
<Sumica> 00,10they are just now hinting at the big bad
<something> :|
<Meanwhile> Und dann they all dehydrated. The end.
<Sumica> 00,10the black gear thing
<Cades[Phone]> hey
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, they were at summer camp when they got pulled into the Digital World. They were temporarily separated from their parents.
<JESmith71> MadSurge: ...although their parents do get involved later in the series when they go back to the real world
<Meanwhile> Overly attached digimon.
<something> lol
<Dark_Horst> oh, he evil
<Dark_Horst> at least now
<ASoftFluffyThing> HELLO BRONYSTATE,
<something> hi
<Reikim> ...Hm. Got this massive .mkv file labelled as Gunbuster. VLC Media Player displays a green screen, but I've got sound. Am I doing something wrong?
<Cypresswolf> Hello ASoftFluffyThing
<MadSurge> JESmith71: ah, the nineties, when parents didn't want to even touch their kids' games :D
<Bluemario2> ..............illusion........
<Kandarihu> Watching the English dub, I REALLY liked it when Tai returned to the real world for one episode.
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs Cypresswolf
<Dark_Horst> ...they look edible
<Bluemario2> nvm
<something> lol dark
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ It's SO FLUFFY
<Reikim> Failing that, is there another media player that will play .mkv?
<AJIsAwesome> ohai ASoftFluffyThing
<Hat> Reikim have you got the codecs
<flutterchu> now i know how bad of a dub twas in english
<Dark_Horst> told you
<Kimori_mobile> yo
<something> <_<>_>
<Reikim> I've never had a problem with mkv before.
<Kandarihu> Reikim, MPC is pretty much the best there is for it.
<Reikim> Also, the subtitles aren't even showing up.
<Kandarihu> VLC will handle MKV. But it's VLC
<something> nope
<Dark_Horst> delicious water. sounds neat
<Dark_Horst> why dont we have that?
<Hat> Reikim under Video, there is Subtitle track option
<something> lava
<Sumica> 00,10MPC is better imo
<MadSurge> These mons are wielding the power of friendship all wrong! YOU MUST DO RAINBOWS WITH IT
<Reikim> I've got that
<Dark_Horst> not so delicious anymore
<something> drink some lava
<flutterchu> it came out of my left speaker for a moment (it scared me)
<Sumica> 00,10it handles mkv 10bit like a champ
<Reikim> Subtitles are on, but neither them nor the video show up
<Reikim> Just a blank green screen.
<Slender_Pony> hello evrypony
<Reikim> It confuses me.
<something> hi
<Kandarihu> Reikim, did you install MPC straight? Or did you install CCCP?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Slender_Pony
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello Slender_Pony
<Reikim> I've got VLC Media PLayer.
<Reikim> *Player
<Sumica> 00,10yeah you probably need CCCP
<Slender_Pony> but dont take the note (you can tell by my name)
<Reikim> CCCP?
<Kandarihu> CCCP is great for fansubbed anime.
<Slender_Pony> wut is that/
<something> badass
<Sumica> 00,10comunity core codic pac
<Kandarihu> Combined Community Codec Pack
<Sumica> 00,10somthing like that
<Barbetos> Nice zoom on that thing.
<Slender_Pony> its pony time
<MadSurge> USE SAND ON IT :D
<Slender_Pony> i love gravaty falls
<Reikim> Whelp, better go look that up then
<Kandarihu> Reikim, hang on
<Sumica> 00,10keep in mind if you have halai media spliter it will take control of any subtitle settings
<Reikim> I don't know what that is so I should be fine.
<flutterchu> avgn: BURN motherfucker BURN
<Hat> Am I old fashioned using VLC for everything
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sooound
<Sumica> 00,10I think it's part of CCCp
<AltyValts> hi
<Sumica> 00,10not at all Hat
<something> burn baby burn
<Sumica> 00,10it gets the job done
<MadSurge> Why can'r rhese monsters shut uuuuup -__-
<Sumica> 00,10MPC just has more functions
<Hat> I want use the best software
<something> :|
<Reikim> I'm hoping MPC solves it, because otherwise I just downloaded 6 GB of anime for nothing :I
<Cypresswolf> :) The song Fireman by George Straight came to mind when they introduced Meramon :D
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: would you shut up if you were on fire? that shit has to hurt man
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: that looks natural to him though
<Meanwhile> Run you little squid plants.
<sing_song> Well, no ship sherlock. You're a fire degimon
<something> fuck
<Kimori_mobile> hey, dont think I saw you here before, are you new?
<something> o fuck
<DerpyMuffins> Who came up with the names?
<Cypresswolf> Fire the cannons - Oh wait
<MadSurge> Just leave the chicken there, you'll have a nice digidinner
<MadSurge> Inb4 owned
<DerpyMuffins> Chickens cant fly
<something> lol madsurge
<Barbetos> er.
<pony_2028> bird monster, attack is fire. wut.
<DerpyMuffins> Fight fire with fire, smart
<DerpDash> yeah fire works great -_-
<Dark_Horst> something tells me fire wont do much here
<Allegr0> they totally thought this through
<DerpyMuffins> Its not very effective
<Sumica> 00,10gas for the fire
<flutterchu> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/179/1/a/Pikachu_and_Patamon_by_furret306.png
<AJIsAwesome> SUDDENLY Allegr0 :O
<JESmith71> Well in the dub they changed it to Spiral Twister which turns into a wind attack
<TheMaster> digimon always seemed silly to me. that the monsters could just evolve at will. sort of takes away the illusion that the writers wern't just totally making it up as they went along
<Allegr0> AJIsAwesome ;)
<DerpyMuffins> Hey Allegr0
<Dark_Horst> yes, more fire and air
<Kandarihu> Hey Allegr0
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: only because you never saw one flying
<Dark_Horst> that will do it
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai Allegr0
<Allegr0> hey all
<MadSurge> :D
<TheMaster> then again pikachu lost to a magikarp in a pokemon episode so I suppose it makes no difference
<Dark_Horst> Allegr0: hi
<MadSurge> USE WATER AND SAND
<Meanwhile> >Being attacked by a fire monster
<Meanwhile> >Try setting it alight
<DerpyMuffins> Use sand attacl
<pony_2028> oh boy
<Allegr0> cue guitar riff!
<pony_2028> here we go
<Dark_Horst> ZING!
<Hat> I wonder why they say the names of their attacks
<Kandarihu> Awesome music here
<DocMeticulous> Hyped!
<DerpDash> AWWWWW YEEAAAAAAA
<Cypresswolf> attack Meramon with fire attacks - brilliant
<Allegr0> uglyphoenixmon!
<pony_2028> dam that thing is ugly
<Dark_Horst> Hat: japan. they always do that. everywhere
<Meanwhile> I always wondered why his mouth is stitched.
<Hat> :D
<sing_song> He's getting biger becasuse he's a fire thing
<Sumica> 00,10it's just a bird.
<MadSurge> Noooo, I don't want these kids to succeed! D:
<CrimsonPhoenix> DIGIVOLUTION
<TheMaster> birdamon? not even a clever fire pun?
<Sumica> 00,10a large bird mind you.
<Dark_Horst> Hat: becasue yelling the name of the attack makes it stronger. proportional to noise level
<Sumica> 00,10a large angry bird
<CrimsonPhoenix> it might be because of the nostalgia
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I like the dubs better
<MadSurge> No sell
<MadSurge> Total no sell
<TheMaster> use the giga drill breaker birdamon!
<Mozdoc> Damn.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Di-di-di
<CrimsonPhoenix> Digimon
<Meanwhile> Birdramon is really fucking ugly.
<Hat> What an upgrade!
<Mozdoc> That's quite a big evoloution stage...
<Allegr0> anti-fire!
<MadSurge> WHAT
<XylemTube> Well that escalated Quickly
<DerpDash> My chili is so spicy im litterally tearing up :'(
<Dark_Horst> why did that hurt him now?
<MadSurge> MORE FIRE KILLS IT?!
<MadSurge> WHY
<Hat> So whenever the group is in danger one of them evolves and saves the day
<Bluemario2> Too hot for ya? *ba dum tish*
<TheMaster> so the gears are basically rip-offs of the shikon jewels in inuyasha right?
<Allegr0> so they were right all along!!
<pony_2028> you would think this would be a logical time for the seal monster thing to evolve, but nope, we get a giant bird
<Kandarihu> Fire = destruction, I guess
<Meanwhile> Clearly the problem was that there WASN'T ENOUGH FIRE!
<Dark_Horst> Hat: for now. they're still learning about that stuff
<MadSurge> Hat: I start to see a pattern :D
<sing_song> how does something so cute become that big bird?
<something> :);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9>_><_<
<Mozdoc> Its made of fire, wouldn't it just absorb more fire?
<Sumica> 00,10dont emote spam
<CrimsonPhoenix> Now that's beating fire with fire
<pony_1598> wtf is this...
<Dark_Horst> gets more routine later
<Hat> He got... fired!
<AJIsAwesome> pony_1598: Digimon
<Whiskra> peko peko
<AJIsAwesome> Hat: :I
<Mozdoc> Who would've thought something so cute could have a little fire monster inside.
<Hat> Mugwies
<MadSurge> Why "japanese growling stomach" means "fart sound" in western
<AltyValts> 6Yeah i'm new :D
<Kandarihu> Mozdoc, it's in the nature of the Digimon.
<Bluemario2> lol
<Dark_Horst> maybe japanese are a weird strain of vulcans
<something> :P
<pony_1598> THE END
<Cypresswolf> Seeds! for everybody
<Hat> Yeah, bird food!
<Allegr0> godzirra!!
<Dark_Horst> their organs are all somewhere else
<TheMaster> the japanese are vulcans? that makes much to much sense
<something> it godzil
<TheMaster> supress emotions at all times, in love with science and technology and logic
<XAX> Oshit. Am I missing the podcast?
<Cypresswolf> throw the seeds on the fire - Instant popcorn :)
<Ponies47> O.O
<JESmith71> XAX: Hasn't started yet
<Dark_Horst> and animes are the vent
<Allegr0> xax, we always start at 89 est :P
<MadSurge> So, do any of these monster pugs evolve into something that doesn't match their previous form?
<Meanwhile> TheMaster: I don't see the relevance of tentacles to Vulcans though.
<Allegr0> 9*
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, I don't see the Japanese suppressing or controlling their emotions all the time.
<Hat> Evolve into a delicious meal somebody
<Ponies47> Ohai Allegr0
<XAX> Allegr0: Is that at the end of this hour? Iunno my timezones.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey guys
<Allegr0> hey Ponies47
<TheMaster> The Japanese are super repressed. Their ideal version of feminity is being quiet and doing whatever someone tells you
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: now, that would be telling, wouldnt it?
<MadSurge> Hey Allegr0, wanna diss Digimon too? :D
<Allegr0> wishwishwishwish
<Allegr0> I loved digimon when I was younger MadSurge :P
<TheMaster> and clearly tentacles are japan's pon far
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol anyone remember Fighting Foodons? :D
<something> my mom is going cazy what do i do
<MadSurge> CRUSH KILL DESTROY SWAG
<something> lol
<MadSurge> YAAAAAAY
<Wolfmane> haha pinkie pie in skyrim..
<pony_2028> oh boy
<Bluemario2> lol skyrim
<Cypresswolf> What are those black orbs in Angelmon's chest?
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah
<DerpDash> well this is...new
<Meanwhile> Smile in this case means bleed.
<MadSurge> PINKIE MAKING EVERYONE SMILE~
<something> i got this mod
<JESmith71> I like to see you bleed bleed bleed
<Dark_Horst> actually it'S been on the net for a long time now
<TheMaster> should play a one piece episode.
<Sumica> 00,10skyrim did't like her partys
<CrimsonPhoenix> I wuv Gamerboy385
<DerpyMuffins> She only smiles when she kills someone
<Cypresswolf> Robocopmon
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, the only reason tentacles exist is because there's a law against the drawing of male genetalia.
<TheMaster> yes, and so japan improvised
<DerpDash> Cypresswolf: so true...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14aaand back
<Shammy> mooo
<SaxyPretender> 0,14what have I missed? ;__;
<Hat> Pinkie arrows
<XylemTube> Dem smiles o.o
<DerpyMuffins> She is the only one smiling
<prince-dari> So, to the people who are here
<CrimsonPhoenix> right now I kill with Grace in skyrim
<JESmith71> SaxyPretender: Digimon Ep 4
<Mozdoc> Smile damn it! Or off with your head!
<GabeMoistmon> Ohai dari
<Cypresswolf> I miss playing Skyrim - 3 months, almost 4, later my neighbor still has it :(
<MadSurge> SaxyPretender: a chicken killing a fire monster with FIRE .__.
<XAX> SaxyPretender: What was for dinner? .-.
<Cades[Phone]> welcome :D
<DerpyMuffins> Lol Pinkie vision
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Salmon
<prince-dari> If we decided to change films from choosing an A film and a B film, to choosing a film with >7.5 rating and <7.5 rating, what would you think?
<Cypresswolf> :D Hoof Bump
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Ehhhh
<GabeMoistmon> XAX, he has octorocks
<Hat> Hoof bump!
<XAX> GabeMoistmon: Oh boy!
<Hat> There aren't enough bandits to kill in Skyrim
<Reikim> The idea has merits.
<TheMaster> poorly rated movies arn't always bad. critics are not always known for their taste
<Meanwhile> Would we still call it A and B dari? Because that looks a little wordy.
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: but why?
<MadSurge> prince-dari: that would be easier for my puny brain to understand :D
<Kimori_mobile> yeah! :)
<Dark_Horst> i liked the a/b method
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, That may be easier to classify, yes, but I like the system we have already
<prince-dari> Yes, the >7.5 would be A, and the <7.5 would be B
<TheMaster> after all. Kung Pow is a A+ movie, and they gave it a 'bad' rating
<prince-dari> Dark_Horst: Lotteries are long because not everyone agrees on what is A and B
<Meanwhile> Is that going by IMDB?
<GabeMoistmon> prince-dari, what about an exactly 7.5 rating?
<pony_2028> sunshine sunshine *punch punch*
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: 7.5 where?
<XylemTube> The song is oodly fitting
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'd be against it
<prince-dari> GabeMoistmonL That'd be A
<GabeMoistmon> Why not B?
<CrimsonPhoenix> BOOKS
<Reikim> 7.5 on Rotten Tomatoes, I'm guessing?
<Meanwhile> Why not Zoidberg.
<DerpDash> love this vid
<Dark_Horst> i'd rather stick with the old system too
<Bluemario2> books!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> rotten tomatoes suck..
<CrimsonPhoenix> GOD I LOVE BOOKS
<DerpyMuffins> Books are sexy
<Sumica> 00,10I would rathr go by IMDB
<MadSurge> Dem sexy books
<Sumica> 00,10if we even do that
<Hat> If you see a pink thing moving in the Skyrim wilderness, RUN
<Meanwhile> Well it'd definitely cut time down and it's worth seeing how it goes.
<Kimori_mobile> are you around Adjeca?
<pony_2028> how can we read if she owns all of them?
<Mozdoc> For some reason I had that grand chorus pop into my head at school last week.
<TheMaster> wouldn't that mean that twilight (the movie) would be classified as an A because of the rating even though its clearly a B movie in quality?
<Reikim> I'm in favour as to the streamlining of the lottery system. However, as I have just shown, you'd get flak from anyone who doesn't agree with the ratings system you're using.
<XylemTube> FUCK YEAH BOOKS
<Dester> Dat Book
<Bluemario2> next is socks I bet
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/130/6/7/the_pen_is_lonelier_then_the_by_seniorpony-d3g0yif.png
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 TheMaster...the current system would already have it as A...
<Reikim> But then, you already get flak for that, so go ahead.
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a high budget film. It sucks ass, but it's not B
<Sumica> 00,10this is difrent from now how Reikim?
<GabeMoistmon> PRINCE ALIIIII
<Reikim> See above, Sumi; I just noted that.
<Mozdoc> I think I want to read now. Don't know why...
<DerpyMuffins> Aladin Ponies?
<MadSurge> :D
<Kandarihu> Well, what's the chance that an A Movie might get WMC'd?
<something> :D
<DerpyMuffins> Pinkie is so Ginie
*Ponies47 Rings a bell
<MadSurge> Pinkie is best Robin Williams
<something> lol
<TheMaster> actually I take that back. twilight would be the B in that system
<TheMaster> since it got a 5.3
<linsett> I love this movie~
<Hat> I enjoy seeing the B movies like Troll 2, movies that are rated bad can just be bad movies. B movies you can at least laugh at
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 the chance is proportional to how close the movie is to Babes in Toyland -_-
<Meanwhile> Fuck that movie.
<GabeMoistmon> Picture this movie night: A is Twilight and B is Babes in Toyland
<TheMaster> and the big lebowski would be an A in that case
<Ponies47> That movie was awful!
<Kandarihu> Princess_ValtheJean, or Epic Movie?
<prince-dari> Epic Movie wasn't so bad
<TheMaster> hm. maybe the 7.5 cut off system wouldn't be terrible in that case
<Reikim> So yeah, prince-dari, I say go ahead with it. It'll cut down on arguments and there won't be much more grief than usual.
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 I voted no on the WMC for that
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 it's not WMC material, at all
<TheMaster> it moves cult classics often to the front, because critics tend to love artsy films
<CCCP> hello
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, but the humour was so raw and horribly timed
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, please, it was horrible.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello CCCP
<thelonepony> Hi CCCP
<prince-dari> I know, but the chat reactions were beautiful
<twilight_sprinkle> TheMaster: true
<DerpyMuffins> Hai CCCP
<Hat> It's the community codec pack!
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh dear
<prince-dari> It shouldn't be WMCed for the same reason Spider's Web isn't WMC
<Reikim> D-Wars still has yet to get WMC, so really, who cares?
<twilight_sprinkle> hai CCCP
<CrimsonPhoenix> I should've been there
<GabeMoistmon> prince-dari knows what's up
<TheMaster> Office space is 7.9 in imdb but twilight is 5.3
<TheMaster> i approve of the change now
<Meanwhile> dari you're the only one who liked that movie.
<Mozdoc> I didn't realize how appropriate and well fitting this song is to Ponies...
<prince-dari> Babes got WMC because it was so horribly boring, no one enjoyed it at all
<CCCP> hi CrimsonPhoenix thelonepony DerpyMuffins twilight_sprinkle and Hat
<prince-dari> With films that are just REALLY bad, we all at least get a kick out of hating on it together.
<JESmith71> Yeah but I've been picking NeverEnding Story as A and its 7.4
<CrimsonPhoenix> ummm hello CCCP
<Cypresswolf> I dont think there's anything that cant be ponified
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it was hard to even riff babes
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 people are mistaking "bad" movies with "no on is enjoying this"
<something> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> RARIQUEST
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 you can enjoy a bad movie
<Adjeca> what's up?
<MadSurge> RARIQUEST!
<CCCP> hello CrimsonPhoenix :3 why the ummm?
<Bluemario2> AP-wait what?
<MadSurge> :D
<TheMaster> you couldn't mst3k it?
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 no one enjoyed Babes
<DerpDash> RarityQuest?
<CCCP> hi MadSurge
<TheMaster> how is such a thing possible? no movie can't be riffed
<MadSurge> Hey CCCP!
<CrimsonPhoenix> CCCP it was just.....nevermind
<Meanwhile> Who wants a blender for Christmas...
<linsett> Princess_ValtheJean ANy other films suffer they clause?
<CCCP> CrimsonPhoenix now i must know!
<Hat> Has anyone seen Miracle Dogs Too
<linsett> other than "those" two?
<Kandarihu> I'm somewhat paranoid about my B Movie choice getting WMC'd.
<Unnr|puppies> TheMaster: some movies are so boring that there is just no way to riff them
<Cypresswolf> I missed Babes in Toyland - I think I came here a month later - how bad was it :D
<Kimori_mobile> was just curious if you saw any new spyro stuff?
<CrimsonPhoenix> CCCP awkward?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Babes was awful
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like
<CCCP> oh okay :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14people dying awful
<Meanwhile> Cypresswolf: Someone died during the showing.
<prince-dari> It shouldn't get WMC unless everyone is incredibly bored.
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 we haven't seen anything else yet
<linsett> Cypresswolf Got the Clause. Never showing it again. You can check the past m ovies list.
<Reikim> So D-Wars should get WMC?
<MadSurge> NOM NOM
<Reikim> Non-rifftrax, anyway.
<Cypresswolf> Better question Epic Movie vs Babes in Toyland? which would you rather watch
<Hat> What does WMC stand for
<linsett> Guys, I have a good idea for a b movie.
<flutterchu> )_)=>
<XylemTube> Reikim: i was gonna ask the same thing
<Meanwhile> Epic.
<pony_2028> that'll do pig
<Meanwhile> Easily.
<Kandarihu> Hat, worst movie clause
<something> space
<Hat> Haha, thanks
<DoctoDoctorWho> behold toot spams
<linsett> Sppaaaaaaacccceeeeeee
<DerpDash> spaaaaaaaace
<Reikim> Honestly! D-Wars was complete WMC material. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten that yet.
<DoctoDoctorWho> GET TO DA BUNKER!!!!
<Unnr|puppies> Hat: Worst Movie Clause, aka a movie so bad that it shall never be played in Brony State again
<Sumica> 00,10D-wars was close
<something> lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Same
<Meanwhile> D-Wars was funny as hell.
<CCCP> Whats the most overrated movie ever?
<JESmith71> And what happens if the IMDB rating goes down? It goes from A to B
<Sumica> 00,10but it had saveing moments
<Reikim> Close?
<Kandarihu> CCCP, I guess Twilight
<Unnr|puppies> Unless someone feels evil and decides on a WMC bore-a-thon....
<Cypresswolf> linsett: I'm aware of that :) I was here for Epic Movie's clause though
<Kandarihu> No tooting here. This is Rarity Quest
<Meanwhile> D-Wars had an old woman walk into a fence and fall down.
<Meanwhile> Worth it just for that.
<Reikim> D-Wars would have been unwatchable without Rifftrax.
<Unnr|puppies> as a threat for a ungrateful and evil populace
<CCCP> Kandarihu I doubt that, it gets more hate then love
<Dark92Enigma> i'M Back..........Unnr what movies were WMC'ed?
<flutterchu> dance liek a phoenix bitch
<Dark92Enigma> Hello, i'm back
<linsett> Cypresswolf Sorry about that...anyways, I have a good idea for a B Movie.
<Adjeca> got this earlier http://www.ebay.com/itm/120986425787
<thelonepony> wb Dark92Enigma
<Sumica> 00,10problem was we had riftrxs version so it saved it
<CrimsonPhoenix> OMG A GIANT ROCK
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah >.<
<something> lol
<flutterchu> -_(\
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol wha?
<DerpDash> xD
<Wolfmane> Henry :(
<Reikim> Yes, but non-Rifftrax D-Wars should still get the WMC.
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<Cypresswolf> linsett: I have a B movie in mind I hope gets the clause :)
<JESmith71> That'd make Galaxy Quest a B too since its 7.2
<DerpyMuffins> Tom....
<pony_2028> poor henry
<Bluemario2> lol
<TheMaster> >17 years
<Barbetos> T_T
<Kandarihu> CCCP, in that case, then overrated is purely a subjective matter.
<Bluemario2> :D
<Sumica> 00,10if we did't have riftrax of Dwars it would have gone down in flames
<Buytoast> so if something gets below a 7.5 on rotten tomatoes it's an auto B?
<something> he my frind
<TheMaster> i don't think rarity was that old
<thelonepony> :'( poor Henry
<something> :(
<Cypresswolf> :P I love that darn typos
<DerpyMuffins> Henry.....
<Dark92Enigma> hi alexxm and AJIsAwesome
<Reikim> How often before has it been required to play the Rifftrax version of a movie because it was that uncompromisingly bad?
<CCCP> Kandarihu :3 it is
<Ponies47> Who's streaming right now anyways?
<Meanwhile> I think IMDB'd be better.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Dark92Enigma :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat House
<twilight_sprinkle> whats worse, is that Rarity went out with his old school friend, Tom...
<linsett> Cypresswolf What is it? Mine's A Troll In Central Park.
<prince-dari> Buytoast: We haven't taken up the system yet, we're discussing whether or not it would be a good idea
<something> lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> :D
<DerpDash> lol
<flutterchu> WHAT THE FUCK
<prince-dari> I was gauging what you guys thought about it
<Barbetos> All those years of life, and he pours his heart out to one pony... he just could not cope.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Cypresswolf> linsett: Monkey Bone
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut :D
<thelonepony> :D
<Dark92Enigma> JESmith71: Yeah, but it's still epic
<Dester> How can i find this on youtube
<DoctoDoctorWho> :D:D:D
<TheMaster> zecora as foreman? That would be very entertaining to see
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Ponies47> Dr. Fluttershy :3
<JESmith71> prince-dari: Yeah but if you go to that system previous As like Galaxy Quest would become Bs
<Reikim> Anyway, I still say go for it. It can't be any more headache-inducing than the current system.
<Hat> Poor boulder
<Dark_Horst> Dester: Horse M.D.
<Ponies47> OH GOD THIS! XD
<flutterchu> dash stupid
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: did you guys stream Nostalgia Critic?
<something> lol
<Buytoast> just wondering, cause if that's the case i need to find a new A to start trying to force up
<linsett> Cypresswolf I'll look it up on Rotten Tomatoes.
<JESmith71> Internet is for Porn
<something> lol
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Nope.
<Bluemario2> oh god
<Kandarihu> Alright. I'm muting this.
<Unnr> Dark92Enigma: Babes in Toyland and Epic Movie, you can find all movies played listed under About Us on the BS website
<Bluemario2> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, from what I understand you guys would just throw the budget factor completely out of the window
<XylemTube> This song never gets old
<Kimori_mobile> wonder what spyro cheats are in it
<DerpyMuffins> lol
<Kandarihu> XylemTube, it's gotten old for me.
<prince-dari> CrimsonPhoenix: Yes, if we switched over it would be >7.5 A, <7.5 B
<Dark92Enigma> You're a pervert :D
<nonody2> Not that im a clopper but this song is true
<CrimsonPhoenix> it would make things simpler I admit
<Dark92Enigma> Unnr: ok, i will
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oh god :D
<DerpyMuffins> Spike is such a perv
<something> lol
<GabeMoistmon> =7.5 is A and a half
<flutterchu> ZE INTAHNERT IZ FOHR PWNIES
<Reikim> Thanks for that, Spike.
<Kandarihu> Some of the most overrated things around me are porn and football.
<Reikim> Good to have concrete confirmation that Spike is a teenager.
<Bluemario2> FOR PORN!
<JESmith71> I made a better video with Internet is for Porn using Sonoic SatAM. I got Sally and Robotnik's lip sync to make it look like they were really singing the song, and their movements and facial expressions matched it too
<Bluemario2> lol
<prince-dari> GabeMoistmon: For God's sake, greater than or equal to 7.5 is A then
<DoctoDoctorWho> I actually managed to give up porn cuz of ponies
<Bluemario2> :O
<Kandarihu> DoctoDoctorWho, congratulations.
<Unnr> Kandarihu but nothing is funnier than annoying you co-workers when they spend all day talking about football fixtures, and you start taking about the Canadian Football League season
<linsett> Kandarihu I feel for you, footballs a religion down where I live.
<CCCP> DoctoDoctorWho so porn is a drug?
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, isn't there a symbol for greater than or equal?
<Reikim> Hey look how much info we could have kept to ourselves.
<Dark_Horst> DoctoDoctorWho: i'm sorry, i dont see the relation
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh yeah three lines that aren't in the keyboard

<Kurra> French fry muffins.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: The reason i always request Nostalgia Critic, is because it's been shown for the movies streamed here (i've seen 2, the 2010 Karate Kid and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) so i find it funny that it hasn't been shown tonight, since he reviewed Space Jam
<Meanwhile> I'll vote in spirit.

<Shizuka> 13what
<DerpyMuffins> Half-Life is fun

<Saeko> No, I just wanna know who Shquishy is
<Barbetos> I used to play Half Life for HOURS.

<Canadian_Brony> kirz|partying dressing up a movie with effects doesn't make it a good movie. Battleship is a good example
<AJIsAwesome> Saeko[Pkmntrainer]: You'll see. :D
<AJIsAwesome> sagas: You'll see. :D
<AJIsAwesome> Saeko[Pkmntrainer]: Tab fail.

<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Why?
<sagas> Canadian_Brony: Must be a server
<Saturn> 08,01i was talking to my brother on skype
<MirrorImage> Allegr0 - in all fairness, the 360 and PS3 are trying to bill themselves as full entertainment solutions, not just gaming consoles
<CiderIsForDrinking> Dat TwiDash
<Canadian_Brony> hi Saturn
<MirrorImage> so they would need it for music, movies, etc
*AdamTheDuck licks Saturn
<Canadian_Brony> and?
<Saturn> 08,01and he said that someone smashed his laptop by accident
<Canadian_Brony> yikes
<Reikim> Oh, well that sucks.
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Twilight
<Sumica> 00,10they did't put a large HD in the WiiU because it dont need it.
<Saturn> 08,01so i went on ebay and plonked Â£389 on a new laptop for him
<AJIsAwesome> that's terrible/
<AJIsAwesome> *...
<Reikim> If Noriko got smashed I'd probably be required to pulla suicide.
<Bluemario2> "hey guys! I'm getting pop=ups on my Wiiu!" "DUDE! HOW CAN YOU DO AN EPIC FAIL THAT BAD!" "Also! We won a free Ipod!! :O" *FacePalm*
<JESmith71> Well I wasn't planning on getting one at launch anyway. Wait till the hype and intinal crowds die off first and wait till it has more games
<CiderIsForDrinking> Dat bedhead
<Sumica> 00,10the disk size is huge and the read spped is better
<Saturn> 08,01i've not told him
<weeping_pegasi82> no pony answered my question...

<Reikim> Three hundred...eighty nine...pounds.

<Saturn> 08,01basically, he's been workign down south for about 6 months now, and the netbook i bought him last christmas was his only computer

<CrimsonPhoenix> Allegr0, again
<CrimsonPhoenix> Console war

<Ryunosuke> Torchlight 2
<AJIsAwesome> Oh

<weeping_pegasi82> *flutterchu

<AdamTheDuck> kirz|boozy, ikr
<flutterchu> weeping_pegasi82: needy *slaps flutterchu * DONT CALL ME NEEDY. needle from BFDI
<AdamTheDuck> D3 was such a disappointment
<twilight_sprinkle> thinking about that question,i just realized how few games ive played
<Reikim|GRUUURGH> MY EYES STING!
<weeping_pegasi82> ok
<AJIsAwesome> kirz|boozy: I heard Diablo 3 wasn't that great. Seeing how I never played Diablo before, how bad was it?
<MadSurge> kirz|boozy: what's so wrong about D3, can you explain me? :O
<kirz|boozy> AdamTheDuck, it hasn't stopped being a disappointment
<twilight_sprinkle> so is torchlight a diablo expansion or someth?
<kirz|boozy> RLAH ruined the core of the game, sloppy programming has caused errors since day 1, to start
<CCCP> good night :(
<Reikim> Oh wait, kirz got off
<twilight_sprinkle> bai CCCP
<Reikim> I AM FREED!

*twilight_sprinkle hits Reikim with a crowbar some more
*Reikim is nommed and crowbar'd
<MadSurge> kirz|boozy: any gameplay related thing except the errors?
*Reikim dies a horrible, painful death, trapped in the throes of an alien parasite and beaten to death by a former coworker
<MadSurge> superretroworld: where I live, it is :D
*AJIsAwesome uses Phoenix Down on Reikim|DED
<Reikim|DED> Whelp, at least, now that I'm a ghost, I am effectively untouchable.
<superretroworld> MadSurge: that sucks
*ASoftFluffyThing sits in her corner with her head in her arms
<Reikim|DED> Sorry bro, enjoying ghosthood, that ain't gonna work.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|DED: except, you forgot who we gonna call
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Why? :(
<kirz|boozy> the combinations of abilities the mobs get late-game and how it spikes the difficulty has it where people would rather avoid the mobs than try to kill them
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Summer cover // Another Fashion Show? // Inner Struggle //
<AJIsAwesome> GHOSTBUSTERS!
<MadSurge> superretroworld: early morning mind you

<kirz|boozy> flutterchu, not sure what you said, but I'm pretty sure it's something people get kicked for
<MadSurge> In fact, I think I might go to bed now. Goodnight!
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome: My friend and I were supposed to hang out today so I went and pickd her up. We got back to my place and she kinds started getting nevous after anout 20 minutes because she had a gut feeling because it's the farthest she's been away from her dorm

<Kimori> I'm back
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome: And I live about 20 minutes away from where she stays so I took her back home. Though it was nie to see her for the first time in like...two years
*AJIsAwesome uses Phoenix Down on flutterchu :D
<Reikim|DED> Curses.
*Reikim|DED is still a ghost
*twilight_sprinkle confiscates AJIsAwesome 's phoenix downs
<kirz|boozy> baord
*AJIsAwesome sucks up Reikim|DED with his Poltergeist 3000
<Reikim|DED> Hence the nom-fest, I guess.
<kirz|boozy> :3
<DashWithRainbows> Hopefully, Renegade X will work on my laptop
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|DED: told you
<kirz|boozy> booze helps
<flutterchu> ghost flutterchu: phoenix down?
<nerf_soldier> whats with this phoenix down thing? why doesn't anyone use monster reborn or a fairy in a bottle?
<Reikim|DED> Hm
*ASoftFluffyThing sits kirz|boozy in a chair "No more nomming"
<twilight_sprinkle> cause ff ftw
<Reikim|DED> I should be teaching myself higher-level mathematics.
<kirz|boozy> fairies are hard to catch in bottles
<Reikim|DED> Eh, maybe I'll play GW2.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I did it to annoy him. :P
*kirz|boozy noms ASoftFluffyThing
<Reikim|DED> I am so far behind the level curve
<kirz|boozy> :3
<superretroworld> oh yeah i forgot that was from luigis mansion
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: lawl ok, i guess il just torture him some more then as long as hes alive :D
<kirz|boozy> I haven't had a chance to play very much lately either
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: You monster. :D
<Reikim|DED> Which one of us is still level 22?
<kirz|boozy> you cannot stop the noms
<Reikim|DED> That's what I thought.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: rawr. :D
<flutterchu> ghost flutterchu: pencil: somtimes Firey is right
<kirz|boozy> lol
<CriticKitten> So I'm playing GW2 and this one NPC is being a sissy. So I took a page from dari's book and said "it's Man The Fuck Up Time :D". He died in the battle, leaving me to fight the baddie alone. -.-;
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: That sucks...
*ASoftFluffyThing squeaks and pokes a kirz|boozy
*kirz|boozy is poked
<Dark92En|gma> gotta go everypony.......see you all tommorrow, if my parents let me
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night, Dark92En|gma
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92En|gma: Bye! :)
<weeping_pegasi82> bye Dark92Enigma
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Dark92En|gma
<ghost_flutterchu> Dark92Enigma: bye
<Reikim|DED> It's these damn updates
<CriticKitten> It's cool, by this point my ranger is so powerful that she makes Legolas jealous with a bow and Aragorn would take sword lesson from her, so the boss wasn't all that hard to solo.
<twilight_sprinkle> 2 mispings vs 3 correct pings, the correct pingers win this round!
<Reikim|DED> Really saps my will to play
<Reikim|DED> Also crappy connection
<kirz|boozy> a ranger with the right setup can solo a lot of stuff
<ghost_flutterchu> why do people have similar compicated names
<CriticKitten> But it still ticked me off how whiny he was being. He is supposedly a scholar thrust into a leadership position but man, he's no Twilight Sparkle that I can see.
<kirz|boozy> I have a 1.5 mbps line -.-
<twilight_sprinkle> ghost_flutterchu: to anger you :P
<ghost_flutterchu> CriticKitten: where you talking about me?
<CriticKitten> I kinda wanna jab Trehearne in his jugular, but I'm not sure plants have jugulars.
<Kurra> Plants have xylems and phloems :)
<twilight_sprinkle> plants have a stem!
<ghost_flutterchu> this is the third time ive been killed
<CriticKitten> Well this plant is human shaped.
<Kurra> Haarlem...
<CriticKitten> He's kind of like a salad: bland and tasteless without any dressing, and you feel an obsessive need to chop him into fine bits and eat him like one if he's in front of you for extended periods of time.
<CriticKitten> :|
<SaxyPretender> 0,14mmm, salad...
<AJIsAwesome> DALLAS
<twilight_sprinkle> salAd
<AJIsAwesome> SALAD
<DashWithRainbows> Ew, something not meat.
<ASoftFluffyThing> BOGGLE
<AJIsAwesome> BOOGLE
<twilight_sprinkle> BOOGLEY BOOGLEY
<Reikim|DED> ...Wow.
<CriticKitten> Granted, he's certainly no Tidus because he's not obnoxious, he's just....boring.
<Reikim|DED> Wow that's nice.
<Kurra> well laters all, going to a localstream :)
<Ryunosuke> this djinn is trolling me
<CriticKitten> And he needs to stop hogging my glory. :|
<Kurra> YAAAAAY BRONYSTATE! :D

<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: dont remember the eps
<ShadowQuill> kthxbai
<ghost_flutterchu> atleast i can fly now that im a ghost
<kirz|boozy> do you have the stream running, or steam or something like that?
<superretroworld> what is the point of b movies? to make fun of them?
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: well theyre not always bad
<AJIsAwesome> Tom and Jerry movie for B movie next week? :D
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: wait what, really?
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: HELL NO

<Reikim|DED> Also Saxy FGs existed before SF.

<AJIsAwesome> Everlasting_Joy: I know that feel. :(
<MirrorImage> grrr... i really should just get mIRC

<AJIsAwesome> Torchlight seems intersting. Might consider getting it.
<Everlasting_Joy> Is this D3?

<RAWRity> ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST
<Scottish-geeky> DJ_POn-3: awesome oc

<Silver_Spoon> Everlasting_Joy: Something about guns being put to heads and now they're dead, but their life had just begun?
<Kimori> Just put it in spam
<CrimsonPhoenix> The show must go on
<thelonepony> yeah?
<DJ_POn-3> i'm gonna add goggles around her neck :)

<RAWRity> This is ourself under pressure
<shibaru> I already deleted them all
<DJ_POn-3> Kinixyx: that could work
<Everlasting_Joy> Silver_Spoon: The desire to not die, and admitting it better to not have been born at all than to do such a henious act.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well RAWRity She was a Killer
<CrimsonPhoenix> Queen
<Scottish-geeky> DJ_POn-3: http://scottish-geeky.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5dxbfx ere my OCs

<Scottish-geeky> RAWRity: such nauty word

<DJ_POn-3> Scottish-geeky: cool is that used from pony creator
<Scottish-geeky> CrimsonPhoenix: thanks :)
<Dken2021> I need to redo my OC, I hate it's hair
<CrimsonPhoenix> Scottish-geeky, it was meant to be bad
<Cades[Phone]> lol you'll never lose me :p
<Scottish-geeky> DJ_POn-3: yah i cant draw anemuls to save my life
*Silver_Spoon has made waaaaay more OCs than could possibly be healthy
<Scottish-geeky> CrimsonPhoenix: bad?
<DJ_POn-3> Dken2021: how is it bad?
<Scottish-geeky> Silver_Spoon: lol
<Kimori> Is there something wrong with your other Cades name?
<RAWRity> as in your OCs are so ridiculously "dark" and "edgy" that it's comical
*Silver_Spoon goes to find one...ashaedly
*Silver_Spoon *ashamedly
<CrimsonPhoenix> thank you RAWRity
<RAWRity> Like, one even has a knife for a CM.
<Dken2021> DJ_POn-3 http://i1221.photobucket.com/albums/dd467/DKen2021/My%20Little%20Pony/OC.png made in mlpgenerator, that kind of bad
<DJ_POn-3> Scottish-geeky: u can get better art is always upgradable in you're mind
<Cades[Phone]> nah, its just my friends are here and its easier to use my phone
<CrimsonPhoenix> even Tracy doesn't have a knife
<RAWRity> YOu know the .MOV series did that as a joke, right?
<Kimori> ohh ok
<Scottish-geeky> DJ_POn-3: i know
<Reikim|REDEAD> RAWRity: Wait. Are we lamenting general OC design, or a specific case?
<CrimsonPhoenix> instead she has Nicolas Cage as a cutie mark
<RAWRity> Reikim|REDEAD: specific
<Silver_Spoon> Reikim|REDEAD: a specific case, I presume
<Cades[Phone]> they'll probably be gone in about half an hour to an hour
<Reikim|REDEAD> Ah
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, that's actually a pretty cool one
<Reikim|REDEAD> Which specific case?
<Scottish-geeky> CrimsonPhoenix: her name is stabb happy
<RAWRity> CrimsonPhoenix: to this day, I'm still proud of making Lord Celestia's CM Kevin Bacon
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe as you say changing the hair
<Cades[Phone]> my friends playing spyro right now :p
<Kimori> Have them join us :)
<RAWRity> also, quick question: Why is Val a princess atm?
<Dken2021> yea, the color scheme is nice, but don't like the hair the generator gives you
<CrimsonPhoenix> Scottish-geeky, your point?
<Cades[Phone]> nah, they dont like it that much
<Princess_ValtheJean> 2,14 because the Pony Princess declared everyone a princess
<Reikim|REDEAD> ...Whelp, a little scrolling, found the ridiculous OCs.
<Kimori> awww
<DJ_POn-3> Scottish-geeky: gaah i am forbidden to enter the site :'(

<Dken2021> the princesses are coming, the princesses are coming!!
<DJ_POn-3> mmmuuufffiiinnnsss
<PRINCESSity> now, we have Princess Hour
<Princess_Potato> :D
<PrincessPhoenix> PRINCESSity, I decree
<SaxyPretender> 0,14no one kingdom should have all them princesses
<AJIsAwesome> I have a question to ask you all. I just made an account and attempted to play TF2. It asked me for an application to start TF2 and I clicked on the option "Steam". The window for it closed, but it has not loaded yet. Was there something I did wrong? :S
<Princess_Joy> Even a princess, I'm still dead sexy.
<Princess_Potato> xD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, dat music
<Cades[Phone]> did alty talk at all while i was gone?
<Princess_Joy> AJIsAwesome: If I recall right, you should just have to restart Steam, then try again.
<Princess_Silver_Spoo> Am I doing this correctly?
<Princess_Potato> spoo...
<AJIsAwesome> Princess_Joy: Okay. Thanks.
<Princess_Silver_Spoo> -_(\
<RAWRity> f
<Silver_spoon> Let us never speak of this again...
<Princess_AJIsAwesome> I might as well join in on this princess thing. :D
<Scottish-geeky> RAWRity: my ocs are supst to be dark
<RedeadPrincessReikim> Princess time.
<Silver_spoon> Nor this: i.imgur/wpq6E.png
<Kimori> a little
<God_The_Athiest> i is make URL SHADY
<God_The_Athiest> http://5z8.info/mercenary_n2j9vf_nic_cage_naked
<RedeadPrincessReikim> ...Oh great.
<Cades[Phone]> oh
<PrincessPhoenix> Scottish-geeky, it's still horrible design
<Silver_spoon> lemme try that again: http://i.imgur.com/wpq6E.png
<RedeadPrincessReikim> ^^
<Scottish-geeky> PrincessPhoenix: pardon?
<PrincessPhoenix> Silver_spoon, may I ask what's with all those marks?
<RedeadPrincessReikim> First God_the_Atheist decides to exist.
<RedeadPrincessReikim> Then argument on OC design.
<Dken2021> Silver_spoon it's pretty nice
<RedeadPrincessReikim> (although the OCs were, actually, badly designed)
<PrincessPhoenix> without those blue marks, tatoos, or whatever
<Silver_spoon> PrincessPhoenix: I hit the random button a few too many time, they worked...sorta
<Princess_Potato> I'm keeping this nick
<PrincessPhoenix> it looks very good
<superretroworld> first maids and now princesses, what next?
<RedeadPrincessReikim> I like it, Silver_spoon
<Dken2021> I question the markings, but who am I to judge?
<Spectrum_Rush> ...
<Spectrum_Rush> what is this princess hour now\
<Silver_spoon> At least it isn't spoon hour
<RedeadPrincessReikim> We are all princesses, whether we choose to show it or not.
<RedeadPrincessReikim> Apparently.
<Silver_Spoon> 'cause that'd be creepy
<RAWRity> huh. this game looks like LoL crossed with Diablo 3
<PrincessPhoenix> RAWRity, well it's Torchlight 2
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's Torchlight 2
<Scottish-geeky> PrincessPhoenix: what part of my OCs is horbal as u put it
<PrincessPhoenix> Scottish-geeky, I'm sorry to say but everything?
<RedeadPrincessReikim> Don't forget the grammar...
<PrincessPhoenix> it doesn't blend in the MLP universe at all
<Silver_Spoon> Scottish-geeky: It probably stems from primarily the color choice, extreme contrast like that is bad in design
<PrincessPhoenix> Silver Dark and red is always bad in design
<Scottish-geeky> Silver_Spoon: good i wasint going fo nromal and happy
<PrincessPhoenix> on ponies anyway
<nerf_soldier> PrincessPhoenix: how about navy blue and green?
<RedeadPrincessReikim> You can forgo normal and happy and still do it well.
<PrincessPhoenix> nerf_soldier, it could work I guess
<Scottish-geeky> PrincessPhoenix: i dont see enthing rong with Geeky and Stab Happy
<PrincessPhoenix> gotta be carefull with the shades
<Silver_Spoon> Ocersaturated may be the word we are looking for?
<Silver_Spoon> *oversaturated
<Silver_Spoon> OIC what I did there
<RedeadPrincessReikim> Stab Happy.
<RedeadPrincessReikim> ...
<RedeadPrincessReikim> Moving on now.
<Scottish-geeky> RedeadPrincessReikim: Stab Happy is the name of Geekys sister
<RedeadPrincessReikim> Yes I realize that
<RedeadPrincessReikim> I am now removing myself from this conversation.
<PrincessPhoenix> Tracy is still better OC
<Scottish-geeky> RedeadPrincessReikim: whats rong eith that
<RedeadPrincessReikim> In fact, I am leaving chat entirely.
<RedeadPrincessReikim> Good night.

<RAWRity> you should look it up. It's fantastic, as are their other albums

<nerf_soldier> MOVIE :[
<SaxyPretender> 0,143 part ep?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> 3 episodes dvd
<Silver_Spoon> I would hope for a movie, but I would not be surprised if it was 3 episodes
*Scottish-geeky sists in corner siping Arizona ice tea
<Princess_AJIsAwesome> Back.
<Silver_Spoon> or even a three part episode *gasp*
<RAWRity> doubtful it would be 3 eps. After all, they have S3 listed as "13x22"
<Dken2021> 3 part episode sounds likely
<superretroworld> Princess_AJIsAwesome: hey
<Cades[Phone]> my friend broke spyro :o

<RAWRity> scout19_tf2: Meghan McCarthy is the showrunner for S3
<nerf_soldier> wait, so lauren isn't? :(
<Scottish-geeky> DeathStar: mez two
<RAWRity> Faust hasn't been part of the show since S1 ended
<superretroworld> RAWRity: did she work with se 2 also?
<something> lol
<scout19_tf2> celestia be with her
<RAWRity> superretroworld: nope
<Silver_Spoon> She had consulting producer status, didn't she?
<scout19_tf2> eeeeeyup
<RAWRity> she was an executive consultant. Which means she could comment, but had no control over the show.
<Scottish-geeky> i fell like blowing up megaton agean
<something> im eating steak u jelly
<RAWRity> And theissen may be involved in some capacity for S3, he's not the showrunner this time around.
<shibaru> Mike's sim wants to cheat on me with Gen's sim NOOOO! >M<
<SaxyPretender> 0,14huh, didn't know that last nit
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> off to play some Borderlands
<RAWRity> Meghan McCarthy, the writer for the S2 finale and numerous other episodes, is in charge for S3

<Silver_Spoon> This chat needs more dakka: http://derpy.me/A1dxB
<scout19_tf2> :D i thought we wernt saposed to spoil on here
<scout19_tf2> lol
<Scottish-geeky> OPINE GUNDUM STYEL
<RAWRity> I'm not spoiling anything about the show's content, just mentioning the people involved.
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/101303?scope=scpee797e8c7c16183d62da95919900ca5c09c6b09e0
<Silver_Spoon> muffin to anyone who got the joke
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> nothing pertaining to storyline I think is the general area we're not supposed to discuss
<scout19_tf2> gess dats ok i just dnt wanna be banned
<RAWRity> People have been pestering M A Larson (another writer) for stuff about Season 3. All he's said so far is "Meghan has plans..."
<RAWRity> make of that what you will
<nerf_soldier> makes me wonder though about how the show will be affected by the canstant changing of hands
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> heh, all I can ever think of now when I hear the word "banned" all I can think of is "YOURE BANNED"
<Silver_Spoon> TomDanTheRock is awesome: http://fav.me/d5fmmdo
<Scottish-geeky> RAWRity: let us hope for the return of Discord
<shibaru> And he keeps trying to go to work when he's not supposed to for 12 hours
<RAWRity> nerf_soldier: not really. Most shows will go through numerous heads of story during their run.
<Cades[Phone]> lol
<Princess_AJIsAwesome> Honestly, I've been laid back about everything in season 3. Whatever they give us, I'm sure I'll be fine with it.
<Silver_Spoon> Titanic Team-up of a Terrible Trio?
<RAWRity> It's rather rare for a single person to remain in charge of a show for its entire airing.
<Scottish-geeky> Princess_AJIsAwesome: hail discord
<Silver_Spoon> (Discord, Chrysalis, somepony else?)
<Scottish-geeky> Silver_Spoon: DISCORD
<RAWRity> i'm more interested in seeing new villains TBH
<nerf_soldier> RAWRity: i'm just worried abiout MLP getting into the wrong hands
<scout19_tf2> got that rite RAWRity
<Princess_AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: Same
<Silver_Spoon> nerf_soldier: if it stays strong for two more years, we will become self-sustaining with fanmade episodes
<superretroworld> as long as theres ponies, then im okay
<RAWRity> nerf_soldier: seeing as McCarthy wrote the S2 finale, and everybody jizzed over that, I'd say there's not much to worry about.
<Scottish-geeky> well im bord
<Silver_Spoon> Hi bord!
<scout19_tf2> yea that was an awsome ending to the season
<RAWRity> also, that "fanmade episode" stuff is some horse shit.
<Scottish-geeky> ha ha
<Silver_Spoon> And I'm back?
<scout19_tf2> i like how nopony is payin any attenion to the stream
<scout19_tf2> :D
<nerf_soldier> i'm talking about through the constant changing of hands, we get someone more concerned about making a profit than making a good show
<Scottish-geeky> :);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_96_9>_><_<
<Princess_AJIsAwesome> scout19_tf2: I am. Just have nothing to say.
<DJ_POn-3> Whom ever was talking to me about the cutie mark idea for my OC i drew something like it and see if it works
<RAWRity> nerf_soldier: seeing as the show's already making a profit, your fears are rather baseless
<nerf_soldier> i meant to put a might in there somewhere
<SaxyPretender> 0,14don't emote spam, Scottish-geeky
<nerf_soldier> RAWRity: ok
<Silver_Spoon> Good shows = profit...it's about time a company figured that out
<Dken2021> oh look, someome's enjoying the emoticons, again
<superretroworld> question: were there more brony newcomers in se 1 or se 2?
<Scottish-geeky> SaxyPretender: yes my lord
<Princess_AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: S2 I think
<RAWRity> S2.
*Silver_Spoon laments the cancellation of Firefly
<RAWRity> Silver_Spoon: It's been 10 years. Fucking deal with it.
<Dken2021> superretroworld season 2 from the looks of it
<superretroworld> i agree with se 2
<RAWRity> Firefly was a decent show, but it doesn't in any way deserve the devotion it gets.
<Silver_Spoon> RAWRity: I'm just being melodramatic :P
<Shizuka> 13which one should i take
<Princess_AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Top left
<RAWRity> Shizuka: roll a D4 to choose

<DoctoDoctorWho> d3rb: its the least I could do for him, Saturn is not a normal master, but he did rescue my bronystate abilities. not to mention I was never really normal to begin with so,
<sub06905|Tardis> Mine was in the Summer of '83
<therainbowvortex> :D

<AdamTheDuck> and on and on
<AdamTheDuck> Sat down on night
<DJ_POn-3> AdamTheDuck: so many ponies
<AdamTheDuck> Watched first half of season 1 to find Octavia~
<AdamTheDuck> Saw her on the damn last episode for about 15 seconds
<AdamTheDuck> All I can say is: Time well spent.
<AdamTheDuck> Best 15 seconds EVAH~
<DJ_POn-3> AdamTheDuck: and thats how equestria was made
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: with me i saw the origonal movie with my sister when i was younger
<DJ_POn-3> AdamTheDuck thats what said (best 15 seconds EVAH~)
<AdamTheDuck> So yeah, I became a Brony in my quest to find Octavia. Story of my life :3
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe DJ_POn-3 :P
<therainbowvortex> the 10 years later i keep hairing about mlp being poupler
<DoctoDoctorWho> I had beyond nothing else to do and I saw it on netflix so I said "hell, why not?
<AdamTheDuck> Hooflix "3
<AdamTheDuck> :3
<DJ_POn-3> My story i saw Rainbow Dash at school in a art show so i looked it up and was assimilated into the herd :D
<therainbowvortex> so i was like no way in hell this was good so i watched the first epiesoed
<AdamTheDuck> Resistance is futile~
<Dovah> and then DoctoDoctorWho made me watch it...
<therainbowvortex> and then the seconed and i was like whoa dude this is awsome but i wasent sold
<DoctoDoctorWho> I did, that I did
<AJIsAwesome> I saw KYM's video on it at first. I was initially negative about the show, and I kept switching from negative to neutral about the show. Late March, I gave in and decided to watch the show. Early April, I became a brony.
<Dovah> and so here i am
<DoctoDoctorWho> Assimilation complete, moving to next target
<therainbowvortex> so i stoped watching but i kept thinking about it at school
<therainbowvortex> and then i read my little dashie and by the end i was a brony
<Ponies47> Dang it chat derp .-.
<DJ_POn-3> Bronies/Pegasisters we love and tolerate and all we get are a few likes here and there but we manely run into haters who have nothing better to do than troll us PonyFolk

<d3rb> i must have a magic version of windows, mine does everything i want it too
<d3rb> then again you get far more involved than your 'average' user Phase4
<Gold_Demona> You probably don't really do anything too extensive on it d3rb =/
<d3rb> oh i mulittask the hell out of it, but all standard sorta programs
<Gold_Demona> I don't mean multitasking. =/
<d3rb> i know
<d3rb> ok no i didnt
<Phase4> 00,02d3rb, thats just it, this is probably the cleanest install of windows this side of australia
<Phase4> 00,02if it doesnt match the paterns i see from microsoft or come from someone i know is capable of writing good things, its not running
<Gold_Demona> Initial setup is ALWAYS a pain in the ass. ?_?
<Phase4> 00,02seems that it might stay stable this time

<AdamTheDuck> Java, well obviously I do :3
<Phase4> 00,02segfaults shouldnt crash the entire thing
<Java> You're Replacer?
<AdamTheDuck> although I only reall enjoy that song at the piano kicks in

<DoctoDoctorWho> Scenerio: you have been reincarnated as your OC, and have the chance to form a relationship with a pony, who do you ship yourself with?
<Java> heheh
<Java> Because I stumble upon Mt Poniator once here.
<Java> in Rarity channel
<Mutterguy> find another OC to Keep hasbro pure
<d3rb> he pops in alot but i never see him say much
<Phase4> 00,02d3rb, its just stupid, they cripple the os's performance for reliability reasons then cripple reliability for performance reasons
<Java> Yeah, I suggest about a good scene for his animation and suddenly he replied!
<Java> I was like "Whoa! Mr Poniator here?
<Phase4> 00,02what you end up with is broken crap like this, where i have zero control over what drivers are loaded and one of them breaks everything
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: I ship myself with my husband's OC... If I ever manage to get his OC's design down. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> come on, I know at least ONE of you has dreamed of dating a pony

<Gold_Demona> :D
<Gold_Demona> How about Mayor Mare?
<Java> Yeah, he original Nagato
<Java> the
<Java> Rei is supposed to be a complex character.
<Java> That's why it's sad when she died and her clone don't remember anything.
<Gold_Demona> She kind of is and kind of isn't
<Java> :(
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: ya like to poke holes in the term "everypony" dontcha?
<Java> What if I'm a dragon?
<Java> you can't call me everypony...
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Just making sure you actually mean what you say. XD
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo GilDash
<Java> Helli!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: fair enough, mayor mare is safe from my pimpish wrath
<Java> Mayor Mare is alonely mare.
<Java> Poor Mayor can't even organize stuff.
<Gold_Demona> Cheerilie's forever alone and doesn't give a buck.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im sure she's already mareied
<Java> Or she's a playa when she's young.
<Java> She already gave too much buck
<Java> :p
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im not allowed to touch cheerilee
<Mutterguy> Clearly her husband disappeared in 80's after he contracted bonitis

<AdamTheDuck> Hello Lil_B
<Java> Gotta love Timezones.
<Java> Hello
<Lil_B> thanks Gold_Demona and AdamTheDuck :)
<Gold_Demona> I've been up for three and a half hours now.
<AdamTheDuck> Whoa, what time do you wake up Gold_Demona ? 6_9
<Java> 7 30 but everyone still asleep.
<Java> Sunday
<Gold_Demona> I'm usually up at 4am every day, except for Monday, at which I get up at 3am.
<Gold_Demona> Because husband. I make his breakfast and pack his lunch.
<Lil_B> soo... I may have to change my Nickname, or at least use another name as an Artist... because I didn't know that there already is a Rapper named Lil'B and some people already confused me with him
<Gold_Demona> Why they make him go into work so early is beyond me.
<Java> It's common for a couple countries to start their day early
<XAX> Lil_B: You didn't know? .-. Did you think of the name on the spot?
<Java> In mine school start at 6.30 or 7
<Mutterguy> Lil'Brony?
<Lil_B> XAX I honsetly have never heard of him, I used Lil because of guys like Lil' Richard and B because it's the first letter of my real name
<Java> My cousin work on Samsung factory, he have to be ready at his office at 6.30
<Mutterguy> hell you might have to check and see if that one's not taken
<XAX> Lil_B: Damn. Well that sucks :c
<AdamTheDuck> Well anyway, try puting this as your wakeup alarm Gold_Demona :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OLJXVGh0ss
<DoctoDoctorWho> I get up at 4:15 every morning, run 3 miles, shower, then start my day.
<Lil_B> XAX thank good I have only made one real sopnmg that people heard so far XD
<Java> I heard in countries like S Korea and Singapore some of the employee don't even go home.
<AdamTheDuck> Although it works better when you're making a cup of coffee at sunrise :P
<XAX> Lil_B: :o
<Java> They simply sleep under their desk and laundry their clothing.
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: I usually have my coffee like an hour before the sun think about coming up. lol XD
<Java> In Japan game developer tend to not go homr for DAYS.
<dishwasher1910> hello lads
<AdamTheDuck> Hello dishwasher1910
<Java> Hello dishwasher.
<Lil_B> I have to stand up for school at 6:40 (before I used my car I stood up at 6:10) and during my apprentenceship I stood up at 5:30 :/
<Java> I already used to wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning.
<Lil_B> XAX Mutterguy I see if I can come up with something, I tend to be horrible in choosing a name >.<
<Java> A habit now.
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: That's a very groovy song tho. I dig it. :3
<Mutterguy> hell I thought someone might have considered using my username before me

<Mutterguy> i was briefly in San fran on holiday fer a week last year
<Java> I visit Maine over a decade ago.
<AdamTheDuck> Come to think of it... Lots of Eccentrifuge's songs work great in a lovely morning.
<Phase4> 00,02ok

<Phase4> 00,02which is absurd, because the error was not occouring in vac
<Phase4> 00,02impropper programing in vac is irrelivent, its a windows bug if it occours in windows code
<Java> But I'm listening to Luna Waited right now!
<Java> Anyone knows about this movie? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqYkm559tA
<Java> I think this movie will be quite scary.
<Buytoast> i see ads for that shit everytime i take the trains down to the loop
<Buytoast> looks like someone just spalshed a bucket of paint on the grudge
<Java> But with a video recording now.
<Java> Also the character quite xreepy.

<Gold_Demona> There's a vote?
<Gold_Demona> I thought it was a lottery
<AdamTheDuck> Sign up for the newsletter
<AdamTheDuck> Well lottery I mean :S
<Java> Newsletter?
<AdamTheDuck> You're sort of voting for a movie in a way
<Gold_Demona> Sort of, but not really
<Java> Maybe an email will suffice.
<Gold_Demona> It's pure chance. =P
<Java> Asking them nicely works too.
<Java> I mean, that's a hilarious movie.
<Gold_Demona> You have to sign up for the Newsletter to enter the lottery
<Gold_Demona> The lottery is how they pick the movies and episodes every week.
<Java> Sorry guys need to afk for a while.
<AdamTheDuck> For me I'll just continue voting for Forrest Gump every week :$
<Gold_Demona> I don't enter very often, but when I do I always put in Castle of Cagliostro. :>
<Phase4> 00,02time to do a reinstall i guess
<Phase4> 00,02always hate this bit
<AdamTheDuck> Dat's windows for ya
<AdamTheDuck> Well anyway, best remix ever - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YkVbTAhL-c

<alexxm> oh hey AdamTheDuck how are things
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai alexxm
<AdamTheDuck> kinda bored really, still in a cheery mood for some reason
<AdamTheDuck> Might be due to doing nothing productive for 72 hours~
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.microsoftstore.com/store?Action=html&Locale=en_AU&SiteID=msaus&pbPage=Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool << this is broken in chrome
<Gold_Demona> It's broken here too. And I'm opening it on Safari. On a mac.
<Phase4> 00,02safari and chrome use the same renderer
<Phase4> 00,02webkit
<Phase4> 00,02its broken in internet explorer to
<Phase4> 00,02so the sites just broken
<Phase4> 00,02good luck with that microsoft
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Oh Brokensoft
<AdamTheDuck> Microsoft... How I loathe thee :|
<Phase4> 00,02who keeps giving them money
<Gold_Demona> I only give them money when I have to. ?_?
<Gold_Demona> Which is pretty much every time I have to reinstall Windows.
<MadSurge> Hello Phase4!
<AdamTheDuck> So Phase4... How did your experiment with that xbox in a microwave go? :3
<Phase4> 00,02ohai MadSurge
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, didnt get it hot enough
<Gold_Demona> Didn't "Is It A Good Idea to Microwave This" do that?
<Gold_Demona> I'm pretty sure they did
<Phase4> 00,02didnt actually microwave it
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: get in the newsletter and cast your favorite movie! :D
<Phase4> 00,02its a microwave oven
<Phase4> 00,02i ovened it
<Gold_Demona> Isn't a microwave oven a microwave?
<AdamTheDuck> May we ask for the purpose of this experiment? :D
<Gold_Demona> I thought that was the same thing...
<Gold_Demona> Just microwave is the short version
<AdamTheDuck> I've posted so many youtube links :S
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, convection oven
<Gold_Demona> Ah
<Gold_Demona> So not a microwave oven. :P
<Phase4> 00,02microwave ovens heat via 2.4ghz radio
<Phase4> 00,02the one i was using is combined microwave/convection
<Phase4> 00,02i used the convection bit
<Gold_Demona> Heh
<Phase4> 00,02actually microwaving it is pointless and stupid
<Gold_Demona> Never heard of that. That's interesting
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Dumorimasoddaa
<Gold_Demona> I've seen an XBox being microwaved. It's... interesting.
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, lots of prety lights i imagine
<Gold_Demona> The casing melted and then the thing caught fire.
<alexxm> what happens to it Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> I saw it on a YouTube show called "Is It A Good Idea to Microwave This?"
<Dumorimasoddaa> Ohai phase
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, ah, that shows always fun
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: It was fun. Too bad I discovered it like a season or two before they ended it. :P
<Gold_Demona> I think the XBox was one of their earlier ones
<Gold_Demona> Like right after their college dorm room seasons.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Xbox deserves to be microwaved :D
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Gold_Demona> ^^
<MadSurge> The only good thing they have is Cave shooters :D
<AdamTheDuck> I love ost's like these, something with soul and emotion, none of the upbeat crap nowadays :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHZrDe3mFvQ

<bday_killerpony7733> Lasharus If you ask where i live, i live in Denmark on the west coast
<Lasharus> (Yes, I know it's Asian cuisine, but which country are you in :P)
<Lasharus> Ah.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im a Solar Imperial myself, I just wanted to keep tabs on the heritics:)
<Lasharus> Okay, so no, it's not the same restaurant as the one near me.
*GilDash marks DoctoDoctorWho on the hitlist.
<Lasharus> DoctoDoctorWho: Your allegiances mean little. The Eggman Empire will conquer whichever world the doctor wants to take over next!
<AdamTheDuck> For Woona~ :3
<Lasharus> (Me? Fanboy?)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lasharus: cauze the eggman empire has been SO succsessful as of late, or should I mention a certian blue hedgehog?
<Lasharus> *certain. And feel free. I'd like to mention the fact that were it not for Sonic, nobody would be able to stand against the Empire. Doctor Robotnik has every great power in the world running scared to that blasted rodent.
<Lasharus> Oh christ, I'm RP'ing again, aren't I?
<GilDash> Lasharus: Shh! Quiet before they hear you!
<bday_killerpony7733> Lasharus Shame on you!
<bday_killerpony7733> :D
<Lasharus> Bah, I've got an Ask Dr. Robotnik thread running now, so whatever. :P
<Lasharus> Astonishingly, I started that one for a laugh a YEAR ago.
<Lasharus> I'm currently answering questions on page 101. What the hell happened?
<DoctoDoctorWho> and the solar empire has rainbow dash, who everypony who's worth their bits knows is better, faster, and tougher than sonic. so good luck with the invasion, your going to need it.
<GilDash> You underestimated the fanbase, obviously.
<Lasharus> I'm NOT running it on the SEGA forums GilDash. The fanbase, quite frankly, scares me.
<Lasharus> And DoctoDoctorWho, very true. I'll adjust tactics accordingly.
<GilDash> Lasharus: As I said, you underestimated it. XD
<Lasharus> Or rather, the doctor will. It's not for me to predict the next step of our glorious leader.
<Lasharus> Good point, GilDash. :P
<Kurra> @_@....
<Lasharus> I do get genius questions in my thread though.
<Lasharus> "Why are you called Eggman?"
<Lasharus> ...
<Kurra> cool, roleplay.
<Lasharus> Actually Kurra, I'm trying to restrain myself a little. :P
<GilDash> RP? No RP to see here! >_>
<GilDash> <_<
<Kurra> Pff, turn off the safeties and let it ride....
<Lasharus> Well, letting the Egg Dragoon II ride free will probably cause all sorts of property damage...
<Bronysith> morning
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lasharus: Im not afraid of a fat man in a hoverchair, The solar paladins of the Ordeo Malleus will crush you all as heritics.
<Lasharus> Morning Bronysith.
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning Bronysith
<alexxm> how are things Bronysuth
<Lasharus> The Ordeo Malleus? If memory serves, and my Latin isn't TOO rusty, doesn't that translate to "the evil/unwilling order"?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lasharus: Order of the hammer, actually
<Lasharus> Oh no, evil would be 'malus'
<Lil_B> yes, finally got another song done :)
<Lil_B> does anyone here like Majoras Mask?
<Bronysith> um
<Bronysith> of course
<Bronysith> it is
<Lasharus> You're right DoctoDoctorWho. :)
<Bronysith> my fav zelda Lil_B
<DoctoDoctorWho> :)
<Lasharus> I really haven't gone through my latin in too long if I made that mistake. :P
<Lil_B> Bronysith my sec fav Zelda :) just after Link'S Awakening. anyway, My song is a Cover of the Final Hour music in Majoras Mask
<Bronysith> ahhhhhhhhhhh
<Pegono|BlueLantern> WHOO!
*Pegono|BlueLantern comes in with a sack full of bombs
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Pegono|BlueLantern
<Pegono|BlueLantern> Hello, AdamTheDuck. :P
*AdamTheDuck noms on one of the bombs
<Pegono|BlueLantern> NUUU! THEY ARE HIGHLY-* bombs explode *
<GilDash> DoctoDoctorWho: "Nox Aeterna."
<Bronysith> ooooooooooooh game grumps snowboard kids 2
<Pegono|BlueLantern> GoW 3.
<Lasharus> GilDash: "Ovum"
<Pegono|BlueLantern> :3
<Lasharus> :P
<Lil_B> ohai GilDash :3
<GilDash> Lasharus: What? XD
<Lasharus> Latin for 'egg' :P
<Pegono|BlueLantern> ... NYET!
<GilDash> Lasharus: No, I know, just don't see how that relates. XD
<Lasharus> Sorry, I just couldn't resist :P
<Lasharus> "Eggman Empire"?
<GilDash> Lil_B: Holla! :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> brb
<Pegono|BlueLantern> WHOO!
<GilDash> Lasharus: Ahh. Well, "Nox Aeterna" means eternal night, so you can guess who's side I'm on. :D
<Lasharus> You went for eternal night, our other doctor went for the solar empire, so I went for 'egg'. :P
<Lil_B> I only know the Latin I learned while readin Asterix :/ like "Ellea acta est" (I fi wrote that wright)
<Lasharus> Yes, I got there. :P
<Lasharus> "Alea Iacta Est", Lil_B.
<Lasharus> "The die is cast"
<Lasharus> And Asterix is a worthy read. :)
<Lasharus> Okay, seriously, this latest question on my thread just worries me.
<DoctoDoctorWho> "in principis"
<Lasharus> "did you ever notice the amount of BSDM kink there is in some of the Sonic RPGs in the SEGA forums?"
<Lasharus> ............WOT.
<AdamTheDuck> wat o.o
<rdibp> ^3^ /)?
<Lasharus> Asked in my "ask dr. Robotnik" thread AdamTheDuck.
<Lasharus> The question, and the asker, now worry me. Greatly.
<Lil_B> hia rdibp :)
<Gold_Demona> hiyo rdibp
<rdibp> no stream huh?
<Bronysith> i miss snowboard kids
<Bronysith> and my n64
<AdamTheDuck> Nope rdibp, and hi :P
<MadSurge> Lasharus: you should just have Robotnik facepalm there :D
<rdibp> no as in yes or no as in no?
<Lasharus> Remind me to get a Robotnik facepalm image. :P
*alexxm kidnaps Lasharus
<Lasharus> Oy!
<AdamTheDuck> There's no stream at the moment. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> My latinis vaugely limited to translating english terms derived from it sadly
<Lasharus> I was answering questions on my thread!
<rdibp> man Netflix is amazing
<rdibp> :P
*Lasharus escapes from alexxm.
<Lasharus> The nerve of some people.
*Bronysith glomps alexxm
<MadSurge> Also all franchises have terrible pervert fans :D
*rdibp captures Lasharus for alexxm
<Bronysith> r4
<Hat> Can anyone view the stream on android phone
*rdibp and gives him a cookie :P
*Lasharus teleports away.
*Lasharus does take the cookie though, thanks.
<Lasharus> *munch*
<MadSurge> TEL'POR' MAWWIO!
<rdibp> Lasharus: dammit, you were a second away from getting a cokkie :(
<Lasharus> But I got the cookie.
*DoctoDoctorWho blink packs next to Lasharus and brings him back to titan, where he can be safe
<rdibp> Lasharus: suuuuuuuuuure you did
<Lasharus> Well, what else did I just eat?
<Lasharus> Oh, my own cookie.
<rdibp> O_o
<Lasharus> Oh well, a cookie was had, that's all I need to know.
<Lasharus> And now I'm apparently on titan.
<Lasharus> Remind me to bring the Egg Carrier back to active duty. It seems I need a flying fortress to get some solitude around here.
<DoctoDoctorWho> worry not, the grey knights will convert you here on saturn's moon brother
<Phase4> 00,02i wonder
<Lasharus> Of course they will. Greatest genius of all time DoctoDoctorWho. I don't let my mind succumb THAT easily.
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<Lil_B> finally got my Pony CD done, I managed to sqeeze 26 Pony/Bronys releated songs on that Disc XD I'm looking forward to the next time I drive my car :3
<Lasharus> Nice. :)
<Lil_B> oh hi therte Phase4 :)
*Lasharus tacklehugs Phase4.
<Kurra> i think more sleep
<Lasharus> Hi.
<Lil_B> Kurra don't just think about it :P
*Phase4 00,02hugs Lasharus back
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Lil_B
<DoctoDoctorWho> of course, the alternative is being corrupted by chaos and being hunted down with extreme predijuce, or get eaten by tyranids, or necrons, or orks, or eldar, or...
<Bronysith> REDDIT
<Phase4> 00,02stupid windows, i wanted to try for jool orbit today
<Bronysith> Y U DOWN?!
<Phase4> 00,02but windows broke
<DoctoDoctorWho> wow, we've got a real crapsack world goin on dont we?
<Phase4> 00,02and now i have to reinstall
<Lasharus> CORRUPTED by Chaos? I stole a few Chaos Emeralds off Knuckles ages ago (left him a few fakes. He's so easily conned). They can distil and counter Chaos Energy at a whim.
<Lil_B> Phase4 WiiU supports Unity engine now, there now is a chance of Kerbals on the WiiU XD
<Bronysith> sonic is a horrible franchise
<Lasharus> WRONG!
<Lasharus> SEGA did horrible things to a decent franchise. :P
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, that would be AWESOME
<Phase4> 00,02two screens for ksp!
<Lasharus> And Dr. Robotnik is awesome. Like it or not.
<Phase4> 00,02i can manage orbits on one and have cool rockets on the other
<Lil_B> Phase4 well, the developers have to lÃ¶ook into the code again a little biut, but it certinly is possible now
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, if they actually did that i'd instabuy a wii u
<Bronysith> i am going to buy a wiiu to set it on fire
<Lil_B> Phase4 you really like that game uh? XD
<Phase4> 00,02that i do
<JunkerKun> Hey guys
<Bronysith> hi JunkerKun
<TheMonstaMuffin> Heya everypony!
*Bronysith glomps JunkerKun
<alexxm> how are things JunkerKun and TheMonstaMuffin
<Lil_B> hi JunkerKun and TheMonstaMuffin
<AdamTheDuck> Hello JunkerKun
<DoctoDoctorWho> CHAOS EMERALDS? If you think "controlling" chaos with a bunch of multicolered rocks, then I am the master of the winds of the earth because I have air conditioning! WITH SETTINGS!
<Lil_B> Bronysith but burning plastic isn't good :(
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi alexxm and Lil_B. alexxm things are good. You?
<JunkerKun> alexxm: Not bad. Just bought new pony miniaures
<JunkerKun> *miniatures
<Lasharus> That's nice DoctoDoctorWho.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello TheMonstaMuffin
<alexxm> i'm good TheMonstaMuffin
<Lil_B> TheMonstaMuffin good, just finished a song :3
<Lasharus> And it's not about controlling chaos with them. It's about harnessing it. The Chaos Emeralds are perfectly ordered constructs designed to encapsulate pure chaos energy.
<Lasharus> Also, I can't believe I'm going through my headcanon here.
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi AdamTheDuck. Good to hear Lil_B n' alexxm
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lasharus: that pile of gravel you call the master emerald does not controll a fraction of the warps energies
<Lasharus> Believe what you will. I can't really prove otherwise because I don't currently have the Master Emerald with me.
<Phase4> 00,02http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/221/e/d/angel_eyes_by_justdayside-d5ahcxg.gif and then everyone dawwed
<Lasharus> Knuckles finally figured out that the piece of paper on the ground saying 'master emerald' wasn't actually the real one.
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe
<Lasharus> Only took him two months, that's a record for him.
<MadSurge> Phase4: most adorable Derpy gif EVER :3
<JunkerKun> My internet is trolling me
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, ikr!
<AdamTheDuck> http://fav.me/d5br46m My phone wallpaper :3
<JunkerKun> All seems to be working fine but stream just doesn't want to load
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, because there isn't a stream up. :P
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: Oh...
<Lil_B> My mpr3-player wallpaper is a minimalistic version of Chrysalis XD
<JunkerKun> F*** =/
<Lil_B> mp3*
<Bronysith> chrysalis is worst villain
<Bronysith> brb
<JunkerKun> Oh well, now I haz teh this: http://rghost.ru/40530016/image.png
<MadSurge> Although I would like more fanart about Derpy not being a retard :D
<Lil_B> JunkerKun that's one pink cadence :/
<Lasharus> Bloody hell.
<Lasharus> That is entirely too pink.
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Yeah, wasn't too enthusiastic about this. But hey, at least I have Gilda
<MadSurge> JunkerKun: HAHA Gilda toy!
<Lasharus> I think I may have permanently impaired my vision.
<Lil_B> JunkerKun oh you bought these 2 packs?
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Yup.
<MadSurge> Pinkadance :D
<AdamTheDuck> http://fav.me/d5b36lu Don't question why, question: "Why not?"
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lasharus: I have an Idea, lets post a picture of our 2 weakest forces, then debate who wins.
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: although I question "where" :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lasharus: who is your worst mook?
<Lil_B> brb gonna update my browser, if I'm not back in a min than something went terribly wrong...
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: Wh...why...?
<AdamTheDuck> Because chikens riding space sharks with laser beams in space.
<Lasharus> What, Dr. Robotnik's worst troop?
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: Eh, works for me
<Lasharus> Technically, I suppose that'd be the bog-standard Egg Pawn.
<Lasharus> Useful for crowd control, but useless against a pressed attack.
<DoctoDoctorWho> for standard assault, here's an ultramarine http://derpy.me/Ji-JQ
<DoctoDoctorWho> and those guys are pussies
<Lasharus> Oh, you swapped to a different franchise?
<Lasharus> I thought you were still on about Celestia's Solar Empire.
<Lasharus> No, an Egg Pawn could probably be taken down by that.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lasharus: oh no, I meld the solar empire with the Imperium all the time
<Lasharus> You could've given me some advance warning.
<Lil_B> and I'm back
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hail the God Empress Celestia
<AdamTheDuck> ohai again Lil_B
<Lil_B> what about Celestia?
<Lasharus> Well DoctoDoctorWho, this is Dr. Robotnik's latest personal battle mech. I think it should suffice:
<Lasharus> http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120402101825/sonic/images/a/af/Egg-dragoon-sonic-generations.png
<Dken2021> mornin'
<Lasharus> If you look really carefully, you can find the doctor in there.
<Dken2021> yea, in the waist cock pit
<Lasharus> (and OOC: I bloody love that thing's design :P)
<Lil_B> you know, I like Game Soundtracks... I collect them... But there are some games where really have to think why there is a buyable OST ... I'm looking at you Amnesia and LIMBO
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, you there?
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, have you heard Red Orchestra's? :<
<Lil_B> Phase4 he's not in the chat
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, not sure what you meen, he's in this channel
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck only heard of it
<DoctoDoctorWho> And even if my head canon is wrong, Celestia and the god emperor have been homies for some time now
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: Meh, I always turn music off in this kind of games
<Lil_B> Phase4: ... you are right... damnit Brain
<Lasharus> Not exactly DoctoDoctorWho. In fact, if your headcanon is wrong, it is precisely untrue that they're 'homies' :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lasharus: hmmm, seems like a match for the collegia titanica
<Lasharus> You realise I am completely ignorant of Warhammer stuff, right? :P
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, but imagine charging into battle to this :< : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq2LbxjwGzU
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lasharus: forgive my slang, the Imperium I presume would be no less thal allies with the solar empire
<Lasharus> Possible, if unfeasible, unless we're going by the 'solar dictator celestia' fan-interpretation.
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: I don't know. I like this one better: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6PMJYoaGf8
<Lil_B> In terms of orchestral score Nobody can really beat ANNO http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fps7itq3_XY
<Lil_B> to bad games like these fall under the Radar nowerdays :( at least Ubisoft is kind enough to still pour a lot of money into this
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah I miss the days where graphics weren't everything to a game.
<Phase4> 00,02urgh, trying to reinstall windows using a crippled windows install
<JRP2234> yay in 30 days
<Phase4> 00,02this might take a while
<DoctoDoctorWho> I found it, basic units in a titan legion. http://derpy.me/KSgES
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, may I ask when that song is played?
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, the advance of gaming is driven in part by the advance in graphics
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, case in point: portal, its a game that could not have existed on previous generations of hardware without some serious cutbacks
<DoctoDoctorWho> dats a BIGASS Chainsaw
<Lasharus> 'in part', yes. But these days it's as if other advances fall by the wayside for more shiny lens flares.
<Phase4> 00,02and not at all on 2d
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, I'm talking about games like Battlefield praise for it's visuals.
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: When Shephard becomes a Spectre
<AdamTheDuck> Battlefield 3 praised*
<Lasharus> Take Final Fantasy XIII. By god it was pretty. By god it was shit.
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, yeah, thats always been anoying
<JunkerKun> Lasharus: Well, the game itself was pretty good. But it wasn't FF we all like
<Phase4> 00,02but the increase in gpu power has allowed games that could not have been made possible
<Phase4> 00,02and older games that look better
<Lasharus> No it wasn't. The weapon system was an impenetrable mess, the crystarium was a rehashed sphere grid, the characters were completely unlikeable, the music was uninspired, the battle system had several glaring flaws... but at least it looked pretty.
<AdamTheDuck> I've always taken more interest in the ideas and psychology behind some games.
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, so while battlefield 3 sucks, the money its pouring into gaming hardware is doing good
<Lil_B> ANNO 2070 can look amazingly beautiful, it's just that these kinds of games just aren't as popular anymore. All RTSs nowerdays are standing in the shadow of Starcraft
<DoctoDoctorWho> I suppose we're done here and moved on?
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh Lil_B, have you heard some of STALKER's soundtracks?
<Lasharus> I've no idea, I'm just trying to keep up.
<Phase4> 00,02something like rage is really interesting
<JunkerKun> Lasharus: I don't know. I didn't like itmuch but I wouldn't call the game complete s**t
<AJIsAwesome> Morning, everyone! :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lil_B: what of C&C 3 Tiberium wars?
<Phase4> 00,02morning AJIsAwesome
<Lil_B> although they kinda made ANNO a bit too overcomplicated now that people who are new too these kind of games are scared off way too quickly -.-
<JunkerKun> AJIsAwesome: Hey
<AdamTheDuck> Morning AJIsAwesome
*DoctoDoctorWho glomps AJIsAwesome
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah that game looked interesting but I heard so many problems with RAGE Phase4
<Lasharus> I would. Too many obvious flaws they could've ironed out before release, JunkerKun. They ironed a fair few of 'em out for XIII-2, I'll give 'em that.
*AJIsAwesome hugs Phase4 JunkerKun AdamTheDuck and DoctoDoctorWho :)
<Lasharus> But XIII-2 loses all the points it's scored and then some for its ending.
<Bronysith> there are only 10 final fantasies
<Lil_B> DoctoDoctorWho yes, but that was about the last one that really got a lot of attention, and how old is that one now?
<Lasharus> Why?
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, aparently it fails as a game, the interesting bit is its engine
<Lasharus> BECAUSE IT ENDS ON A TO BE CONTINUED SCREEN.
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck no, I have tons of soundtracks, but almost none of them are from FPS games :/
<JunkerKun> Lasharus: Wait, XIII-2 already out? O_o
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, 'megatextures' in practice meens MASSIVE environments are possible
<Lasharus> Yes. It's been out for a while now.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lil_B: I wouldnt put it over 10 years, but how old is starcraft?
<Lasharus> And literally, I am not kidding.
<Lasharus> In the middle of the ending, stuff suddenly goes to hell, the screen goes black, and you get "To be continued"
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, look at any rage screenshot, theres no terrain in the skybox, its all rendered
<Lasharus> Well f*ck right off then Square.
<Lil_B> DoctoDoctorWho Starcraft II I ment, but I was mainly just talking about the Product name
<JunkerKun> Phase4: Didn't only ID Tech 4 used "megatextures"? I thought that in RAGE they dumped that technology
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, yes but my friend couldn't experiance Rage's unique atmosphere when it took half a minute to render all the textures :<
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<AdamTheDuck> And mind you Phase4, it's not like his computer was old
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, yeah, that was a problem, opengl suport is crappy on windows
<Phase4> 00,02JunkerKun, the earlier versions used 'virtual textures' or something like that, same tech on a different scale
<JunkerKun> Lasharus: That is... sh*t O_o. Square Enix, what the hell are you thinking?
<Phase4> 00,02JunkerKun, id tech 5 was built around the idea, in theory it allows clean scaling of graphical quality to many different types of hardware
<Phase4> 00,02the intent is to remove the burden of worring about hardware from artists
<Lasharus> Who knows, but I do know that I'm not picking up any more Final Fantasies unless literally everyone says 'okay, so this is the next Final Fantasy VII (or VI, depending on preference)'.
<MadSurge> Lasharus: Final Fantasy is been like that for a while :(
<Lasharus> Very true. In my personal view, X was the last good one, and that one already started to suffer from issues.
<Bronysith> final fantasy 6,7 and 10 are my favs
<Lasharus> (They were entirely too proud of having somewhat mediocre voice actors, primarily :P)
<JunkerKun> Phase4: yeah, and WE still have to buy a very powerfull piece of junk
<Dken2021> anyone played XI? how was it?
<Lasharus> After a while I wanted to strangle Tidus. "Live and let l-" *shot*
<Phase4> 00,02i've got ff 10 for the ps2, havent managed to play it for various reasons
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, what about American McGee's Alice? That had a lovely... insane... soundtrack :3
<MadSurge> Lasharus: It says something when Heroes of Ruin had a better ending that still was a blatant sequel hook
<Phase4> 00,02JunkerKun, yeah, engine needs work, but its a step in the right direction
<Phase4> 00,02away from 'OMG PRETY GUNS' and toward enabling artists to do amazing things
<Lasharus> Heh. Dungeon Keeper II outdid 'em there. They put the sequel hook in the main menu. "DK3 trailer". Not kidding. :P
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: The first one. The second one has only one good track - Main Menu theme
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck I was about to download it, but than it got deleted by the uploader -.- I was inmterrested though
<Lasharus> Sadly, then EA murdered Bullfrog, so part 3 was never made.
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, yeah 2nd one was a sort of disappointment.
<JunkerKun> Lasharus: Nah, they will give rights to another company. And will kill the whole series
<JunkerKun> Though Syndicate wasn't bad actually
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo :P
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck I have Stuff like this: Mother, Mario, Zelda, NIER, Paroius, Phoenix Wright, Kirby, Castlevania, YS and a ton of Inie Game music
<Jmo> No adam, no.
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MhlrKheSC0 :P
<Lasharus> Eh, we'll see what happens next. I'll just enjoy my older games, for now. :P

<Phase4> 00,02ohai Saturn
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, have to close steam, something is making everything slow and really need to get the other thing done
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, sounds like a boss fight :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> Pie flavour
<Unnr> Dken, salted almonds, caramel, chocolate, french silk topping
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck Final Boss XD
<Unnr> and candied bacon
<AdamTheDuck> Hay bacon strips, hay bacon strips~
<Dken2021> mmm, sounds like it taste great, though the name is offputting
<Dken2021> oh, bacon? nvm
<Unnr> Its a garnish
<Bronysith> oh /b/ how you never change
<Unnr> Instead of a cherry on top, or ice cream, bacon
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, why do you visit /b/
<AJIsAwesome> And chat is ded?
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: why dont you visit /b/ ?
<AJIsAwesome> Nvm
<Phase4> 00,02aparently mentioning /b/ kills the chat
<Lasharus> It's a deserved result.
<AJIsAwesome> I guess so.
<Unnr> Phase4: As is according to tradition
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, because it's a cesspool filled with retardation.
<Unnr> Today I learned that there is such a thing as the world championship of team pie throwing
<Lasharus> Close, CrimsonPhoenix.
<CrimsonPhoenix> the people in /b/ are morons
<Lasharus> I usually call it "the biggest cesspit on the internet"
<Dken2021> y'know, /b/ isn't as random as it used t obe anymore
<Lasharus> Great minds think alike.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lasharus, thank you
<CrimsonPhoenix> it was never good
<Phase4> 00,02Unnr, i should find that absurd but the awesome overpowers that feeling
<Dken2021> still mindless posting, but not as random
<Ryunosuke> [09:34] <Dken2021> y'know, /b/ isn't as random as it used to /b/ anymore - FTFY
<Unnr> Phase4: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19690655
*Lasharus slaps Ryunosuke.
<Lasharus> Sorry, reflex reaction on any 'fixed that for you' comments.
<Lasharus> Carry on.
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Phase4> 00,02Dken2021, i think its as random as ever, the bar for random is just higher
<Dken2021> pie throwing eh?
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDtgLn52vhI
<Lil_B> oh right XD, I still have to listen to this weeks "This week in Games " /shameless plug over

<Bronysith> yup
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<MadSurge> Stairway to Heaven? Sung by him it will be "ladder to the basement" :D
<AJIsAwesome> ^:D
<Phase4> 00,02Unnr, every time i hear of something like that now i will be reminded of this http://xkcd.com/1110/
<Bronysith> i think im going on a murder spree
<DoctoDoctorWho> this is my favorite song, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kuhOeihL9o

<AdamTheDuck> The trololol song?
<DoctoDoctorWho> succsessful troll is sucsessful
<DoctoDoctorWho> screw spelling
<Unnr> DoctoDoctorWho: That sounds like it would be uncomfortable
<DoctoDoctorWho> thats actually isnt my favorite song tho
*Unnr was referring to the screw spelling bit
<DoctoDoctorWho> this however, is. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKLpJtvzlEI
<AJIsAwesome> R.I.P chat.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I am CHAT SLAYER! *sigh* Nopony likes me.:(
<Dken2021> let's see if this wakes people up http://youtu.be/7QfY2yA2zh8
<Bronysith> hahahahah so many spaghetti stories on /mlp/
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: I actually saw that a while ago. :D
<Unnr> Brothers and Sistahs, we are gathered heah to mourn the passing of Paddington T Chat. May the gods have merc-ha upon its passing.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Unnr: PA-RAISE DA LOOD!!!
<Unnr> From dust the chat came, and to ooze it shall go. Shoo-be-do.
<AJIsAwesome> Have a random video, I guess. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXCEKT2JdOk&feature=channel&list=UL
<AdamTheDuck> Well anyway Lil_B, a very average soundtrack STALKER has, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRRGYEFZF4A although you had to see what was going on while I heard it to understand the strang atmosphere of the game.
<sammiver> he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him...... because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a Silent Guardian......a Watchful Protector. A Dark Knight... "
<AdamTheDuck> strange*
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck did you just waited unmtil I'm in the chat again ? XD
<DoctoDoctorWho> someday imma just gonna shoot that smartass mouse
<AdamTheDuck> I was typing it then you left XD
<AdamTheDuck> So i just copied it in case you came back :3
<Dken2021> ah good ol' kirby songs
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d5fqimg
<CrimsonPhoenix> I should learn from this
<DoctoDoctorWho> In my Ignorance, Have ANY warhammer 40k nerds Entered The Chat Without My notice?
<AdamTheDuck> I've only played the RTS games for Warhammer :S
<AdamTheDuck> 40K*
<MadSurge> Dear god, does that xkcd image ever ends?
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck sounds really good I like this accoustic guitar
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, name me any Kirby song
<CrimsonPhoenix> the first one that comes in your head
<Dken2021> butter building
<CrimsonPhoenix> ooooh nice
<DoctoDoctorWho> Because I would love to nerd discuss 40k with anypony willing
<CrimsonPhoenix> Factory Inspection
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck here is sommething in the direct opposite direction, but although with guitar :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFC7ouHpQ2s
<Dken2021> ooh, neat one, and from my fav kirby game
<Dken2021> miracle matter
<Lil_B> Dken2021 I'm exited for the 20th anniversary Kirby Collection for the Wii, especially for the Soundtrack CD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Heeh kinda good but doesn't beat O^2
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, well pretty much what was going through, got a distress call on my pda from nearby STALKERS calling for help, having their camp being run over by bandits, I came to help them. After the fellow STALKERS thanked me and slowly drifted to lit camp fire
<Dken2021> oh yea, heard of that, hope it's better than what they did for mario's anniversary
<DoctoDoctorWho> AdamTheDuck: do you have a favorite space marine legion/chapter?
<AdamTheDuck> I decided to stop by as well because it was getting dark, and travelling in darkness is hard. One Stalker took out his guitar and started playing the song at 1:45,
<CrimsonPhoenix> but as for final boss theme my top favorite would be Drawcia Sorceress
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, IT IS
<CrimsonPhoenix> The OST has 45 songs
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, tbh I like the Tau :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> FORTY-FIVE
<CCCP> hi :I
<AdamTheDuck> Hello CCCP
<CCCP> hello AdamTheDuck
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the new challenges are boss
<AdamTheDuck> and this is weird Lil_B xD
<Dken2021> lali-ho CCCP
<CCCP> hi Dken2021
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also there's three episode of the show in it
<AdamTheDuck> In what context is this song played Lil_B? :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the artbook is like quite filled up
<DoctoDoctorWho> AdamTheDuck: god have mercy on you if anyone gets within a mile, 9_9
<CrimsonPhoenix> since it tells you some info about everygame
<CrimsonPhoenix> also six games
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I like that I will be able to play the older games withou t having to buy them on the Virtual Console (although I did played msost of them, on an Emulator before
<CrimsonPhoenix> 13 if you count all the ones in superstar
<Dken2021> looking at it right now, sweet, looks waay better, and kirby deserves it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, still it's nice to have as a collection
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix and historic events... the first geneticly manipulated Tomato come on the marked -.-
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix definitly
<CrimsonPhoenix> and 64, dreamland 3 roms are broken anyway
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck whats your most favorite genre in terms of Video game music?
<CrimsonPhoenix> HUD in 64 doesn't update well
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, orchestral really.
<CrimsonPhoenix> the foreground in Dreamland 3 isn't transparent
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's in emulator
<DoctoDoctorWho> whelp, nopony likes me and nopony wants to listen to what I have to say. Imma go outside
<CCCP> no stream? :C
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, but more importantly it needs emotion.
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck good, Thats my second fav (and what I listen too the most, because my actualy favourite is just so rare to find XD)
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/tqKrsO5MiCM my fav final boss theme
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck nice I have something for you :3
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, like that STALKER guitar track, although it isn't orchestral it still brings the idea of some morale lifting spirit in a shithole alternative universe.
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/40a5e1032bde30609e8c8d39016108f4.jpg human Applebloom and Appleteeny! :O

<AdamTheDuck> Bye AJIsAwesome|AFK
<Lil_B> bye AJIsAwesome :)
<MadSurge> Later AJIsAwesome|AFK!
<CCCP> vye AJIsAwesome|AFK
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix I like that mix
<Lil_B> Kirbys Mass Attack had a nice soundtrack too (and if you listen closely yoou can hear that they used the same samples as MOTHER 3 XD )
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, it's in the game btw
<MadSurge> CCCP: yay, Meatboy!
<Dken2021> yea, I've seen some of it
<CCCP> MadSurge ^-^
<Lil_B> Kirbys Return to Dreamland Soundtrack was good, but I kinda thought it was meh :/
<MadSurge> Lil_B: and some Air Ride too
<AdamTheDuck> It's strange to see chat so alive on Sunday :D
<Kimori> hey Blako
<AdamTheDuck> Usually it's so quiet at this day and hour
<MadSurge> Lil_B: also, miniboss theme from the N64 game :D
<Lil_B> And Kirbys Epic Yarn has a funny story behind it's soundtrack XD
<CCCP> Lil_B whats the story?
<Lil_B> CCCP there are 3 major Composers at HAL who worked on the Kirby games since the NES, Jun Ishikawa, Hirokazo Ando and... another one
<Blako> hi
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, I kinda agree
<Ryunosuke> hhe
<Ryunosuke> "the other one"
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I do have to say
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kirby Epic Yarn had an AWESOME OST
<CrimsonPhoenix> Very sweet and calm
<CCCP> yup
<Lil_B> CCCP and when they god the unfinished Kirbys Epic Yarn (Hal took it over from another company) they just couldn't get the same natural feeling as the original composer had
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm off to sleep. Goodnight everyone. :)
<Dken2021> nighty AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, that song wasn't what I expected when I saw Donkey Kong Country :D
<Gold_Demona> night AdamTheDuck
<CCCP> Lil_B oh
<CCCP> night AdamTheDuck
<CCCP> hello Gold_Demona!
<Lil_B> bye AdamTheDuck :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo CCCP
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMZOLB2iKq4
<Lil_B> CCCP they met up with the old composer, but even he couldn't help them, later tehy just used "Natural Instruments" like real Pianos to get the same feel
<CrimsonPhoenix> CCCP http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0el2sGcfo0
<Lil_B> and there is aa Video of Hirokazo Ando playing the Green Greens Theme on a little Air Toy Piano
<CCCP> Lil_B oh
<Ryunosuke> also
<Ryunosuke> Lil_B, from what I read there were 4 major composers
<Ryunosuke> at HAL
<CCCP> CrimsonPhoenix :o awesomme
<Lil_B> Ryunosuke can you give me the names?
<CrimsonPhoenix> CCCP that video is old
<Phase4> 00,02in a surprise turn of events windows did something right
<Ryunosuke> Shogo Sakai, Jun Ishikawa, Dan Miyakawa, and Hirokazu Ando
<Kimori> how goes?
<Lil_B> Ryunosuke I think Shogo Sakai may also be one, but he only ever worked on one Kirby game
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, explain?
<Phase4> 00,02it left my grub4dos setup when reinstalling, allowing me to easily replace the windows bootloader with grub and get linux working with minimal effort
<CCCP> when ever people talk about HAL it makes me think of 2001 a space odyssey
<Lil_B> CCCP they named themselfs after theis HAL :P
<Ryunosuke> well he also did music for Mother 3 and SSBM
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sorry Kirby but I cannot do that
<CCCP> Lil_B :o
<Lil_B> Ryunosuke and a major composer and arranger in SSBB
<Ryunosuke> ah
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IkvAb6THQY
<Lil_B> I loved the Kirby Arrangemens in SSBB
<Lil_B> Even have burned them on a CD XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love the jazzy metaknight theme
<Lil_B> I think my Fav is King Dedede's Fight Music
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat technoy feel
<Phase4> 00,02good thing too, windows forgot how to ethernet
<Dken2021> that boss medley was good too
<Phase4> 00,02so i need to boot into linux to fetch the ethernet drivers
<Phase4> 00,02now i've done that back to reparing windows
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/Bytvxk97kzY FOUNTAINS OF DREEEEEEEEEEEEAMS
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emt0VbR95Zw
<Blako> quite good
<CCCP> I honestly didn't like many of the arrangments in Brawl
<Blako> I hope I won't chatch cold, because there isn't good weather outside
<Kimori> From what I'm aware of, you can catch a cold because your indoors too much
<CCCP> but thats orignially from melee isnt it?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/S7ENqv0gsWs Melody goddamn Town
<Dken2021> not sure if you noticed, but subspace emissary felt like a glorified kirby game, then again sakurai was director of both kirby and smash bros....
<CrimsonPhoenix> Best level
<Kimori> Thats why more people get sick in the winter, they don't go outdoors as much due to the weather.
<sheep> hi
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, that's what it was
<Blako> hi sheep
<Kimori> yo sheep
<CCCP> Dken2021 Sub Space Emissary was really boring, i liked the cutscenes though
<CrimsonPhoenix> there were even rumors that subspace was that cancelled Kirby game that was suppose to be on gamecube
<Dark92Enigma> i'm (momentarily) back!
<CrimsonPhoenix> but yeah if you play with the wii remote alone
<CCCP> hi Dark92Enigma
<Blako> well, I go out sometimes, but only sometimes :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> it FEELS like Kirby
<Dken2021> CCCP yea, I think SEGA was in charge of the cutscenes iirc
<CrimsonPhoenix> with the double press to dash
<Blako> there isn't much to do
<CCCP> anyway in excited for Super Smash Bros. Universe
<Kimori> Youl probably be fine
<CrimsonPhoenix> CCCP I'm excited for JAPAN TIME
<Dark92Enigma> so how's everypony doing?
<CCCP> whats that?
<Bronysith> Super smash brothers is dead
<Dken2021> hopefully we won't ever experience the great maze again, oh god why
<CCCP> Dken2021 yeah that was painful
<Dark92Enigma> so...........twilight_sprinkle and Wrek won with my movie picks......meh, close enough
<Blako> I hope so, bc I have to duiscus my graduation project with teacher
<Dark92Enigma> gotta find another A movie
<Kimori> Oh? whens your graduation date?
<Lil_B> hi Dark92Enigma
<CCCP> c(-'.'- c)ï»¿
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/6z30c6tXd8s
<Bronysith> the great maze was the best part of Brawl
<Dark92Enigma> you know, watching ''Birdle Gossip'' last Friday night reminded me of an ATHF episode (the classic one)
<Dark92Enigma> the BROODWICH
<Blako> in the 2nd part of spring maybe, it is still a lot of time, I just need to choose which project would be the best (I have 2 quite ready)
<Lil_B> I like everything I like so far about the new SSB, not more than 50 Characters, HAL is working with Namco on it, the original creator + the Guy from the Tales Series, and I hope they pull the same Stuff Muisc wise like last Time XD
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUKB6EFPvqc&feature=relmfu
<Kimori> Is part of it a speech?
<Dark92Enigma> if theres an Universe Brawl, i hope one could create their own characters
<CCCP> i lost Kirby's Epic Yarn though :(
<CCCP> Dark92Enigma i heard a rumor that you can play as a mii
<Dark92Enigma> mii?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: so, new SSB crosses over with Namco?
<Lil_B> They got about 30 different people working on the Soundtrack, Uematsu, Shimomura, Kondo, Hirokazu Tanaka, and everyone elso whos name I don't know right now
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, what, no why
<Lil_B> MadSurge I don't know Storywise, but Production wise yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> most likely we'll have PACMAN
<CrimsonPhoenix> because lol Namco
<Dken2021> Uematsu? Tanaka? Shimomura? oh god this will be excellent!
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Splatterhouse crossover plz :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> hey guys Heihachi in Smash
<Blako> yes, I will have an application which I will talk about - something like presentation. And also I have to have about 30 pages of text (can have illustrations/code) with it
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: what is a mii?
<CCCP> Dark92Enigma you know those creepy little avatars you can have on your wii?
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: oh, those straw ones?
<Kimori> So the project is part of your major in programming?
<Dark92Enigma> those characters made of CGI straw?
<Blako> (*the application I made)
<MadSurge> Yep
<Blako> yes
<Kimori> I see
<CCCP> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mii
<Dark92Enigma> Is Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie an A or B movie?
<Kimori> Definately sounds like a challenge
<Dark92Enigma> (i guess it's an A)
<CrimsonPhoenix> What's the rating?

<cowvarkian> since spongebob only has 9 seasons
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: YOU'RE kidding, right? the first 3 seasons were CLASSICS......the 4th season was still on, but 5th to 7th were stupid for the most part
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: meh
<Dken2021> ohai MLP_Brovakiin
<CCCP> yeah i agree i find the new spongebob really bad
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: I agree with you mostly, but I like the newer seasons as well...
<cowvarkian> I don't find them as good as the prior ones honestly, but they are ok
<CCCP> but i have only watched 2 new episodes
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: I haven't seen pretty much of the 8th or the 9th season.........but they were better than the 5th to 7th for what i could tell, it's TRYING to come back to their style
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: yes
<Blako> well, not yet ( 1 is about 60% and the other about 30% - I will propably choose the 1st one ), there is still time, there are some still som people who don't know what project they will have
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/3939b6d1e32926d1ac3e92ab5cb1f7c0.jpg :3
<Dark92Enigma> also i've heard that the 10th season will be THE LONGEST EVER
<Dark92Enigma> and this Xmas, there will be a NEW CHRISTMAS SPECIAL................WHY?
<CCCP> lol
<Lil_B> wow... just found out that even Der Wixxer has a english version XD
<Dark92Enigma> ''Christmas Who?'' was a classic, and now they're trying to REPLACE IT?
<CCCP> has the power puff girls ever been streamed here?
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: Not that i know
<Dark92Enigma> i guess not
<CCCP> thats depressing
<Dken2021> didn't Luna streamed it afaik?
<cowvarkian> CCCP: I've seen them streamed here
<Lil_B> I have seen a Poster about thje return of the Powerpuiff Girls next year
<CCCP> cowvarkian really? good
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: not sure if want
<Blako> our class is devided to 2 parts - IT and Architecture, but those who have IT can have some project with physics too, but there should be something done with computer (some measures or applets...)
<Lil_B> cowvarkian I'll try to find it again
<CCCP> well powerpuff Girls was made by Faust wasnt it?
<cowvarkian> CCCP: she had some part in it
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: WHAT? THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!
<CCCP> cowvarkian :3
<Blako> it is not clearly programming ( it is called technical lyceum )
<MadSurge> CCCP: her hubby did it, she came on later
<CCCP> oh... Well she did Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends right?
<Dken2021> I belived she was producer of that too
<MadSurge> Yesh :3
<CCCP> :D
<Lil_B> here it is https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/19/TkReTUgOHkWUH0p1s9_IvQ2.jpg
<MadSurge> CCCP: also Frankie is based on her :)
<cowvarkian> CCCP: I think that was mcracken as well
<cowvarkian> *spelling?
<CCCP> wow
<CCCP> Lil_B that made my day
<Lil_B> Dken2021 nope Lauren always only was a designer ond/or Storywriter, MLP was her very first Cartoon as a Producer
<CCCP> Lil_B will she have any part in Season 3?
<Dark92Enigma> 2013...........a whole YEAR!???
<Dark92Enigma> OH COME ON!
<Dark92Enigma> Oh well....:)
<Lil_B> I do not have this from any official source, bnut I'll say I will trust this and that I want to believe XD
<cowvarkian> CCCP: she didn't really have much part in season 2, if i remember correctly
<Lil_B> CCCP she was only involved in the first 3 episodes of season 2, I don't know what she did for Season 3 :/ if she did anything
<MadSurge> And yet look at how much ponies rocked cowvarkian :$
<cowvarkian> MadSurge: ye need not tell me
<Dark92Enigma> we still have LESS of a month to find out
<CCCP> The problem i have with the brony fandom is unfortunatily it scares away alot of people from the show ;~;
<Dark92Enigma> 27 days left FOR AN ANNOUNCEMENT
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/37765e2bc1cad4f90c75fbd3c7792b09.jpg hahahaha I want this mascot to exist! :D
<CCCP> Lil_B =/
<Dken2021> hehehe
<CCCP> MadSurge lol
<Bronysith> i love this fandom easily,
<alexxm> hey guys
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: by shoving down other people's throats? that's not my style
<Dken2021> ah hey there alexxm
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: indubiadly
<CCCP> Dark92Enigma yeah, i know but many do
<cowvarkian> hey alexxm
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: not my style either, just vague allusions :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya alexxm, how are you?
<cowvarkian> MadSurge: vague allusions are best allusions
<CCCP> and quite honestly the show is awesome but you'd be lying if you said it wasnt overrated
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: A bit.....i'd be lying it's PERFECT.
<Bronysith> um
<Dark92Enigma> but it's still AWESOME
<Bronysith> MLP isnt overrated
<Bronysith> like
<Bronysith> at all
<CCCP> yup
<Bronysith> its a cult following
<Dken2021> you sure about that?
<Bronysith> so therefore it is not overrated
<MLP_Brovakiin> MLP is under rated
<Dark92Enigma> I never said OVERRATED btw
<Bronysith> ^
<alexxm> how are things Dken2021 cowvarkian and MLP_Brovkaiin
<Dken2021> so earthbound isn't overrated?
<Bronysith> Dken2021: nope
<Phase4> heres where my whole reinstall windows plan gets clever
<CCCP> hi alexxm
<cowvarkian> alexxm: pretty good
<Dken2021> things are fine alexxm
<Phase4> i have steam and steamapps on a different partition
<MLP_Brovakiin> Great thanks alexxm
<Bronysith> MLP, Legend of dragoon, earthbound are very underrated
<alexxm> how are things CCCP
<CCCP> alexxm okay u?
<Phase4> so in theory, i install steam, put the symlink i had in place back, and bam
<Phase4> all my games are installed
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm how you're doing?
<CCCP> i like Mad Men :3
<Phase4> i probably assume to much and it wont work but worth a shot
<cowvarkian> CCCP: I used to watch that
<Dark92Enigma> OH wait.....my mom is calling, see you all later
<CCCP> cowvarkia USED TO? >: (
<cowvarkian> CCCP: yes, as in past tense
<MadSurge> Phase4: do you have any applications installed, or do you have that much space in your computer? :D
<CCCP> cowvarkian why not anymore?
<cowvarkian> CCCP: because I stopped watching it?
<Phase4> MadSurge, on windows not much, mostly dev tools that i needed to reinstall anyway
<CCCP> cowvarkian why?
<Phase4> most of my productive time is spent in linux
<cowvarkian> CCCP: I just stopped liking it, it got boring
<Bronysith> CCCP: if someone doesnt watch it anymore it isnt a big deal
<CCCP> =/ peronally at first i didnt like it then i started to like it more
<cowvarkian> CCCP: well, I also dislike just about every character on that show, so yeah...
<CCCP> cowvarkian lol
<CCCP> its funny how one of them was Cole Phelps
<cowvarkian> I like AMC shows, but they're characters are so easy to hate...
<cowvarkian> *their
<CCCP> I never liked Two and a half men or the Big Bang theory
<Bronysith> Big bang theory is quite enjoyable
<CCCP> Family Guy is horrible now
<cowvarkian> CCCP: hmm
<DoctoDoctorWho> I have returned Bronies, What have we in discussion that I may Partake in?!?!
<Dken2021> hai DoctoDoctorWho

<Dken2021> CCCP well kinda hard to step out of the mold if yuo've been trying to get a show like family guy on TV for years
<CCCP> DoctoDoctorWho because after Family Guy was cancled and came back it sucked
<cowvarkian> CCCP: wasn't it canceled twice?
