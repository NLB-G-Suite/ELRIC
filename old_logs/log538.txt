<CCCP> BUt Theres a commercial! DAMNIT!
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<cyber_pony13> stay through it
<valoreins> i only watch the pilot episode of the G1
<Tovler> relatively rare. A rarity, if you will
<MadSurge> CCCP: Wait for it
<IMissOsamaBrony> SWAG
<DocSane> They introduced these previously never-mentioned big brothers with a big musical number. Thank goodness the new show would never do anything that lame-- Oh, wait a minute...
<MadSurge> Tovler: I see what you did there!
<valoreins> now i really want to draw the humanized version of G1 with my RPG style
<IMissOsamaBrony> BRONY SWAG
<IMissOsamaBrony> DERPY?

<IMissOsamaBrony> DERPY QUESTION
<cyber_pony13> derpy

<DocSane> They will likely not talk about Derpy.
<MegaMoonShine> 6_9
<oni_link> NEEDS MOAR DERPY
<IMissOsamaBrony> DocSane i know but we can hope, cant we?
<MadSurge> DocSane: yeah .__.
<GilDash> Derpy's a uncomfortable subject I'd bet. :S
<Floris> http://everfreeradio.com/?page_id=2706
<DocSane> It's embarassing for Hasbro and n one would want to risk their job.
<Tovler> Where's Lucille Ball, voice of RD/AJ?
<valoreins> the derpiness here is too damn low
<cyber_pony13> Yes bronies rule
<Floris> http://everfreeradio.com/?page_id=2706
<CCCP> What did i miss?
<Floris> http://everfreeradio.com/?page_id=2706
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tovler, I don't know this Lucille
<d3rb> down in front
<MadSurge> CCCP: demon Fluttershy :D

<MadSurge> CCCP: and Tara making an ass of herself :F
<MegaMoonShine> 6_9 6_9 6_9 6_9 6_9
<twilight_sprinkle> lol random girl, the delicious awkwardness
<Metronome> Dat awkwardness
<Floris> http://everfreeradio.com/?page_id=2706
<DB_Brony> The Derpy voice issue already created a bad time in the fandom, I'd hate to bring it back.
<CCCP> MadSurge: But Tara is best pony
<valoreins> tomorrow...
*IMissOsamaBrony claps
<CCCP> ^
<cyber_pony13> which means twilight is best pony
<valoreins> someone should ask about derpy

<IMissOsamaBrony> YAY
*valoreins claps
<cyber_pony13> Yay for tara
<twilight_sprinkle> Peter New needs more applauds.
<DocSane> I wonder if the guys who titled the panels realize that "Electric Scootlaloo" is the title of a particularly gross R34 fic....
<IMissOsamaBrony> DERPY SWAG
<MadSurge> :D
<CCCP> DocSane: why do you know that?
<IMissOsamaBrony> what now?

<CCCP> DocSane: oh
<DocSane> Why do YOU all seem to know about that?
<CCCP> Wait ITS OVER? ;_;
<DB_Brony> DocSane: Electric Scootaloo is just a take on the term Electric Boogaloo. plus there's so much erotic fanfiction of everything out there that you're bound to land a similar title
<Alchemist> im back
<MadSurge> CCCP: someone must have recorded it, wait for it on YT
<DocSane> I know about Breakin' 2.
<Alchemist> what did I miss?
<GilDash> Alchemist: The VA pannel.
<CrimsonPhoenix> well now that the most important part is over we can go back to the circlejerk
<Alchemist> D:
<MegaMoonShine> Alchemist: Not much, just THE FREAKIN' VA PANEL
<IMissOsamaBrony> lol
<DocSane> It's such an old, old joke to use ___ 2: Electric Boogaloo.
<Tovler> Black Sheep 2: Do Androids Dream of Electric Boogaloo.
<cyber_pony13> you can im going to sleep
<CCCP> MadSurge: i know BUT THATS TOOOOOOOOO FUCKING LONG!
<oni_link> GilDash: is that it for today??

<CCCP> GilDash|AFK: THAT TAKES TOOO LONG FOR IT TO BE UPLOADED!
<Alchemist> Was the VA panel awkward?
<GilDash|AFK> Alchemist: Not really, no.
<DB_Brony> there were no audience questions
<MultiStar101> Naah not at all
<oni_link> Alchemist: in a good way
<valoreins> we need to make demon fluttershy fan-arts
<CCCP> DocSane: I Can't relax! D:

*MadSurge hugs back AttackWithHugs
<DocSane> Take your mind off it by reading horrible R34 fic that I'm convinced was written by an actual pedophile.
*IMissOsamaBrony jumps back into air vent before AttacksWithHugs get him
*AttackWithHugs is hugged by cyber_pony13 and MadSurge

<AttackWithHugs> Hello, CCCP
<twilight_sprinkle> so dont take me up on the times
<Ryunosuke> there is a character named Luna, who has blue hair, and lives on the moon
<DocSane> There's a reason I avoid most fan fic. It's because every so often you run across stuff like THAT.
<MegaMoonShine> Ryunosuke: :O :O :O
<MadSurge> CCCP: I could try and find you a panel where Tara voices Darth Vader with Bubbles' voice :D
<IMissOsamaBrony> is anything playing on the bronystate livestream?>

<Alchemist> Please dont groan at me, but I found many interviews somehow awkward.... Other interviews (like the latest with Tara on the Fat Man on Batman show) seems to be more "natural", more..."fluid", continuous.

<MadSurge> So, are they done with cosplay and tweetponies?
<CCCP> Alchemist: yes
<Computer_Pony> :P /
<OneTrickPony> is anyone watching the Bronycon stream?
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, those are this hour

<OneTrickPony> wow, only one person
<Kandarihu> Next hour is Game developers
<Lil_B> Kandarihu I hope they can show everything XD, there are at least 4 or 5 MLP Fangames in the making Oo
<FairysHuff> Just took more painkillers.
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: how about a shower, pitch black and bed rest? It helped me more than medication when I had migraines.
<MegaMoonShine> Well, later dudes :)
<CCCP> bye MegaMoonShine
<CountDoofus> Night, MegaMoonShine
<CCCP> hi CountDoofus
<Alchemist> bye MegaMoonShine
<CountDoofus> Hai CCCP
<alexxm> bye MegaMoonShine
<alexxm> hey CountDoofus
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: I slept 16 hours since yesterday and I missed movie night last night. I want to stay for euro movie night. As it's actually movies I want to see this time.
<CountDoofus> Hai alexxm
<CCCP> Now Rainbow my dear i cannot express my delight!
<CountDoofus> Been here for a while, but oh well :)
<CCCP> Its abundantly clear that some where out here is a pet that will suit you just right!
<CCCP> I can't wait to get started but first let me set a few rules
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: hope it gets better soon. How long does your migraines usually last? (mines were anything from 6 to 30 hours)
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Unknown... I've had them last a whole week before.
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Completely random
<Tovler> I wish I could have seen the the cosplay interview with the couple dressed as the Cakes complete with baby cake twin plushies.
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: and I guess CT scan and EEG were inconclusive and you are on a cocktail?
<Kandarihu> FairysHuff, Ususally, I seem to deal with migraines best by sleeping it off, and cutting out ALL light sources. I suppose it's a bit late for you to commit to that.
<alexxm> so does anyone know what was up with the mail server this week
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Never had a CT scan or EEG. Doctors just did blood tests but didn't find any indicators. So I'm on Amatryptoline which I'm taking a break from for a month hence the huge level of pain.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still haven't got my newsletter
<Alchemist> nope. we didnt get any newsletters. thats all I know.
<FairysHuff> Kandarihu: I do that to. But I want to see the movies today.
<diddutz> alexxm: just that BS wasn't able to send mails, and now tries to change their mail sending system and that this lottery the survey from last week will be reused
<alexxm> ok thanks diddutz
<CCCCCCCCCCCCP> waiting -_-
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: weird, they didnt do any bloodtest with me. Oh, doctors and their ways :D
*valoreins shouts with Heavy's voice "DOCTOOR!!"
<MadSurge> CCCCCCCCCCCCP: Nice nick :D
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Yeh. This IS the NHS we're talking about. They probably don't want to do something as expensive as a CT without suspicion of something serious.
<CCCCCCCCCCCCP> MadSurge: :3
<kempa> Hello everypony!
*kempa waves
<valoreins> ohai kempa
<Meanwhile> T'would appear to be the most common video. Buffering.
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony
<BrOnyxia> hi everypony
<Kandarihu> Well, if I have stuff I have to do over a headache, I tend to put pressure over the eye that's giving me pain (not actually touching the eye itself). You can try doing that during the movie. It's not like it's 3D anyway.
<FairysHuff> Meanwhile: hallo
<BrOnyxia> hey Meanwhile
<kempa> hey Meanwhile and Br0nyxia and valoreins
<Meanwhile> Allo BrOnyxia.

<valoreins> dammit for a second i thought bronycon went up again
<AttackWithHugs> MusicalPony: Of course. The recording method is better than January's.
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Yes. But being my overly cautious self I wasn't comfortable meeting someone I'd never met before in an area I don't know. So I'm waiting till he has free time to meet me in Edinburgh.
<CCCP> bai errypony
<MusicalPony> AttackWithHugs: yeah definitely. :P
<Meanwhile> Bye CCCP.

<Meanwhile> That sounds like a goddamn plan.
<MusicalPony> lol when the bronycon is back on im not saying a single word here.
<AttackWithHugs> MusicalPony: I like some of his stuff, but I don't have "favorites" musician-wise. Songs, definitely
<Dark92Enigma> I'VE GOT A GODDAMN PLAN! i LOVE THAT meme
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: I'm really bad at reading people so I hope I haven't soured Saturn towards me in some way. I tend to end up with people disliking me and I never understand why.
<MusicalPony> AttackWithHugs: they're really falling behind huh?
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma what meme

<sergio_scriptor> so is the movie "final fantasy" has anything to do with final fantasy ? :|
<Silverscreen> 1,11oh, and my nose is photoshopped as well. And my hair and beard are removed...
<Irish_Pony> Silverscreen: Quite o_@
<Dken2021> yea, that's what I fugured
<Meanwhile> So basically it's you but not really. :3
<sergio_scriptor> Silverscreen: so you are danny devito ? XD

<Silverscreen> 1,11Sergio: ...yes.
<Obsidian> sergio_scriptor: THere is a guy named SId
<MusicalPony> i wish to meet Lauren Faust...
<Dken2021> oooooh *sudden realization* I guess there's no lottery then
<Irish_Pony> Silverscreen: nope.avi o_@~
<Kencolt> sergio_scriptor: Technially, yes. It has many of the themes in most Final Fantasy games. But it's a bit rushed. Visually beautiful though-- startlingly realistic. Almost broke Square at one point.
<MusicalPony> that is my life goal. if she dies before i meet her, my life will always be incomplete.
<drf|laptop> 03heh, my grandma offered to buy me a GPS so I don't get lost in Florida
<Tovler> damn. The only way my A movie will be well received is if Silverscreen does his movie trivia on it (The Secret of Kells)
<drf|laptop> 03But I already have one, just outdated
<DerpStar> Can anypony confirm that Ashleigh Ball was in ME3 or not?
<drf|laptop> 03time to see if I can pirate the maps
<sergio_scriptor> Kencolt: so it's a mediocre game-film ?
<MusicalPony> ME3? i dont think so Tovler
<SuperGotenks1989> Rainbow Dash would be a good soldier.
<SuperGotenks1989> Oh and Meet the Pyro.
<MusicalPony> i love Ashleigh...
<Silverscreen> 1,11p_q
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: Actually it's just a mediocre film. It has nothing to do with the actual games.
<DerpStar> Supposed to be an Asari on Thessia
<MusicalPony> freakin harley quin right there!
<DerpStar> Sucks cause they all die :(
<FairysHuff> I don't care what anyone says. I love Spirits Within.
<Meanwhile> Good for you.
<Alchemist> the only thing I remember is when it came out it was considered to be the top tier animation.
<sergio_scriptor> Meanwhile: :| great,another "let's atract fans of the game wby naming our film the same as the game,but having nothing to do with the games",just like "doom" or "the super mario bros" movies :|
<DerpStar> I got to leavef for 4 or five minutes passing chat to DoublePint
<Kencolt> sergio_scriptor: No... it's got themes from ALL the games-- the recurring themes. The story itself is totally different-- just as each FF is different from each other. It was also the first truly photo-realistic all CGI film made-- visually stunning, and Square almost took a total dive on it because it wasn't commercially successful and it cost a LOT to make.
<MusicalPony> ohmy... this music isnt all good... meh. i wish i could change it

<Dken2021> well, at least there's a Cid in the movie, though it's spelled with an S, and he looks like he doesn't know anything about airships
<Alchemist> more irish(?) folklore-ish punk-rock: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89NjEeHku8o
<Silverscreen> 1,11Metronome, stop it.
<Metronome> k
<MusicalPony> hahahhaha omg i just remembered something. The whole voice panel was from canada and the guy was like "why do you think the best voice actors are from canada?" and i dont remember who but one of the ladies said "Because in canada it's 20% cooler" i was soooooo happy :D
<Kencolt> sergio_scriptor: And at the time-- as today-- RPGs were and are a niche market. As a "gaming film" , well, it's not. It's a film with themes common to a series of games. And no, it's not as bad as doom.
<DoublePint> We finally get to see one of my movies ^^
<Thedude946z[Online]> Mentronome: I can do it too... ☺ ☻
<Silverscreen> 1,11I didn't like Spririts Within. It was boring, predictable, its characters were flat and all around stupid, it lacked any real morals, and after watching a ton of Final Fantasy gameplay in the student lounge, I don't see ANY similarities between that film and the series.
<Thedude946z[Online]> Mentrome: Without coping and pasting
<Tovler> I need to revisit the movie. I only saw Spirit Within once while it was in theatres and I was bored to death during it.
<Metronome> :D
<Kencolt> Dken2021: There are also chocobos if you know whereto look-- on a poster, a t-chirt, a stuffed toy, a decal on a briefcase.
<Meanwhile> Silverscreen: Apparently there's a character in the games with the same name as one guy in the film. That's about it.
<sergio_scriptor> Kencolt: thank god,but it always anoys me that game-films never folow the exact story of a single player game,like WHY ? the story works perfectly with a movie format,why do movie companies need to chnage that ?! :|
<MusicalPony> living tombstone!!!!!!
<EspyLacopa> Final Fantasy: Spirits Within was a massive tech demo.
<Kencolt> Silverscreen: If you think about recuring themes in the games, you'll start to notice them.
<Tovler> wait. If I get carbs and mt dew, I can stay awake a little while longer
<Dark92Enigma> OK Everypony i must tell you something
<sergio_scriptor> Dark92Enigma: what is it ?
<omegasparkle> cake
<Ran> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ran, you are a 6Wailmer.
<Ran> !eonget
<Meanwhile> Mountain Dew. That stuff should be loaded into artillery shells.
<MusicalPony> yes Dark92Enigma ?
<ScriptBot> 4Ran just got a female 7Flareon
<Alchemist> Tovler: drink tea instead, it wont make you fat.
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile: That would be a war crime.
<NullRadix> Someone riddle me this: What is the all-encompassing theme that defines a game as a Final Fantasy game?
<Thedude946z[Online]> The ace of ♠
<Dark92Enigma> I'm planning on making a fanfic starring the Nostalgia Critic
<PonySpawn> I love me some Arizona Green Tea
<Dark92Enigma> And the AVGN
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: Eh, true. I'm pretty sure the Geneva Convention says something about utilising soft drinks.
<Tovler> straight caffeine just isn't enough.
<Dken2021> sergio_scriptor kinda have to blame potential audience, reasons game films are different to game plots cause directors try to appeal to a large range of audiences
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
<omegasparkle> the name and similar world setup
<drf|laptop> 032013 maps
<MusicalPony> Dark92Enigma: thats awesome!
<drf|laptop> 03someone's a bit ahead of themselves
<Kencolt> sergio_scriptor: Remember-- FF isn't a single story. It's a series of quite different stories with recurring themes. This is a moviw with a lot of FF themes in it. Really, it's rather unlike any film made before or since.
<drf|laptop> 03the maps I have now are called 2012 and I got them last year
<Silverscreen> 1,11That's like saying the Super Mario Brothers movie had a lot to do with the Game because it had the same general concepts and names. :/
<Alchemist> Tovler: caffeine pills then? :D
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile: Soft drinks? That stuff burns like acid, man!
<Kencolt> Silverscreen: Technically-- it did. Just in a horrible horrible way.
<Meanwhile> Frankly I think the FF games are piss as well, but go figure.
<TrixieBaconMuffin> one final fantasy game has about as much to do wih the next as with this movie
<Dark92Enigma> MusicalPony IKR? It's already been done before, but he did'nt went to Equestria as A PONY
<Alchemist> only ff game I played was ff4 and it was addictive.
<FairysHuff> Meanwhile: To each their own.
<Dken2021> IV I enjoyed fro story, but V I enjoyed for gameplay
<valoreins> all FF games are "meh" but i only see it for a drawing/animation reference
<sergio_scriptor> Dken2021: but that never works! look at doom,the story of a marine that goes to hell to save everyone is awesome,why did they had to change it about a virus ?! it's anoying,the only good part about doom was the "first-person" scene,that was prety awesome
<Meanwhile> FairysHuff: Bring forth the sheeple.
<Kencolt> This probably has more in common with games like FRF7, 8, and 10.
<omegasparkle> i has all teh vinyl scratch's on meh screen!!
<MusicalPony> a one trick pony's only got one song a one trick pony plays it all night long one trick pony never try something new one trick pony could be me or it could be you!
<Silverscreen> 1,11Kencolt: As much as I enjoyed the SMB movie, I don't relate it to the game. It's too different. Same with Spirits within. It's more Sci-Fi than Fantasy, which completely destroys the concept from the very beginning.
<DoublePint> Does anypony play ME3 multi on PC, DerpStar and I need decent teamates when either of us gets the PC
*Ninjazz gasps
<Ninjazz> MY GOODNESS.
<Silverscreen> 1,11I actually LIKED the DOOM movie.
<Obsidian> lol
<Ninjazz> IT'S BEEN SO LONG!
*sergio_scriptor slaps Silverscreen face
<Kencolt> Silverscreen: As I said-- more in common with FF7, 8, or 10.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6my parents didn't realize the DOOM movie was based on a game until the FPS scene
<Lil_B> The only thing I actually didn't like about Spirits within were the Characters (especially the stupidity of the Bad-Guy, firering the cannon even after he saw that he was wrong) and really broing middle... I just wasn't enjoing the movie, it had a lot of flaws
<DoublePint> I enjoyed it as well Silverscreen but DerpStar hated it
<Dken2021> sergio_scriptor true, though that really depends how much the source material has for a movie plot and the writer's ability to convert that
<DrHobo> hey
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Side rooms are open for anyone that missed that
<Dark92Enigma> MusicalPony and i've planned on involving the AVGN on it too, but.......i don't know as much of him as i know NC (except that i've seen a thousand of his most famous reviews)
<omegasparkle> your ponies need moar ponies
<Silverscreen> 1,11It had an original plot and story, but like SMB, I completely remove its correlation from the game.
<MusicalPony> im depressed.
<d3rb> why MusicalPony ?
*DoublePint hands MusicalPony a beer
<TVNOOD> Hello. : )
<CrimsonMaid> well shit
<alexxm> how come MusicalPony
<JESmith71> Silverscreen, did you know that in the first draft of the SMB movie, it was orginally going to have more game elements in it and actually take place in the Mushrrom Kingdom? However, it went through many different revisions until it became the one we got
<DrHobo> why MusicalPony? D:
<MusicalPony> d3rb: cause the cosplay isnt on D:
<Silverscreen> 1,11It's how I enjoy Comic Book Movies and "based off a book" movies as well. I remove the correlation and I usually end up enjoying it more.
<CrimsonMaid> Final Fantasy or Pony game developper
<MusicalPony> NO COSPLAY D:
<alexxm> hey TVNOOD hows your day been
<d3rb> ohh
<Kencolt> Hmm... I don't remember the opening to Spirits Withing starting like this.
<DrHobo> o.O
<Obsidian> Oh no
<Sundaysmile> YES
<DoublePint> passing DerpStar the PC cya everypony I shall be watching in the background
<Thedude946z[Online]> YES
<MusicalPony> DoublePint: i dont drink beer sorry
<Irish_Pony> Silverscreen: so something like Stuart Little?
<Meanwhile> Nyeeeeeeeeeeeeh
<DrHobo> the hell is this
<sergio_scriptor> Silverscreen: i went to see doom,hopping to see a marine go to hell and save everyone,instead i got something about a virus,that killed the movie for me,the only good part about doom was the frist person scene and the BFG3000
<kempa> Pinke rulz! :D
<Ninjazz> Dat Pinkie Pie <3
<noname> party time :)
<pony_7269> Pinkie :D

<Thedude946z[Online]> :O
<d3rb> well...there will probably be vids on yutube later, not the same but its something MusicalPony
<alexxm> no not this i don't approve of this song
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen Yes, but come to think of it, The movie has it's creativity.....because HOW COULD YOU STOMP ON TURTLES ON REAL LIFE?
<Kandarihu> So, we're doing Brony Movie Night anyway?
<beeep100> had this on in the background.
<Thedude946z[Online]> Party time :O

<sergio_scriptor> dat titanic movie
<alexxm> yeah Kandarihu why wouldn't we
<d3rb> omegasparkle, why would you turn desktop ponies off?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Sergio_Scripter: You didn't like it because you had a biased pre-set opinion and expectation. That's why a TON of movies are disliked and it's why I end up liking what most people hate.
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Why would we not.
<Nerom> This sounds really weird with nightwish in the background :D
<Obsidian> Pinkie is the only thing that makes this bearable
<pony_7269> :O
<omegasparkle> to see teh stream
<OneTrickPony> yayz
<Dark92Enigma> OH YEAH
<omegasparkle> they are all grouping on top of teh video
*Dark92Enigma PARTY TIME
<Silverscreen> 1,11JESmith71: Yes I did. In fact the script was changed daily to the point where Bob Hoskins and the guy who played Luigi openly ignored them and just did whatever they were told to do.
<pony_7269> Its Party Time alright :D
<Kandarihu> Well, the Bronycon panel on the fangames is starting too
<sergio_scriptor> Silverscreen: tell me about it :=|

<MusicalPony> well ill go now. since you're watching a movie. talk to everyone later!
<Dark92Enigma> MusicalPony why are you depressed?
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma I like the fact that this actually makes a lot of sense
<Obsidian> Later MusicalPony
<MusicalPony> sorry, everypony
<DerpStar> Bai MusicalPony

<sergio_scriptor> DrHobo: yep
<alexxm> bye MusicalPony
<Dken2021> seeya MusicalPony , nice having ya here
<sergio_scriptor> bye MusicalPony
<JESmith71> Yeah I know Silverscreen in fact Dennis Hopper got into a huge rant with the director because they rewrote the scene at the last minute and it was different from the one he rehearsed for
<Silverscreen> 1,11The only movie I ever let myself build expectations for was The Avengers, and that's because I had 5 movies and a sh*tload of promotional material behind it.
<Kandarihu> Er, wait. It's going on Youtube next week. I don't know when tomorrow.
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B So, you heard about my idea?
<d3rb> cya MusicalPony
<Meanwhile> Aka, A movie. With the words "Final" and "Fantasy" in the title for no other reason than milking it.
<DrHobo> sergio_scriptor: wierd e3e
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen AND IT KICKED ASS!
<FairysHuff> I got my pizza, got my Spirits Within and I'm doped upto the eyeballs with painkillers. I'm good to go ^_^
<DerpStar> Yay
<Ninjazz> This absolutely has nothing to do with FF.
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma maybe, but right know I don't know what you mean
<DerpStar> :O Really Ninjazz ?
<omegasparkle> gaia
<Thedude946z[Movie]> What the? I watched this yesterday...

<omegasparkle> just waiting for all those dat ass moments
<kempa> Final fantasy the spirits whithin
<valoreins> if i were the one who made the title of the movie, i would remove the "final fantasy" on that movie
<Silverscreen> 1,11Dark92Enigma: F*** YEAH AVENGERS! But, I have to end that conversation here. The sh*t movie is starting.
<beeep100> Dramatic much.
<JESmith71> Will we have more debates on if the A and B movies should have been swapped? Let's see...
<DerpStar> Need ME movies
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B about a fanfic starring the Nostalgia Critic

<pony_7269> Explosion
<OneTrickPony> what movie is this?

<Kencolt> Suare made the movie, and considered it thematically FF. Your milage may vary.
<d3rb> final fantasy spirits within OneTrickPony
<Silverscreen> 1,11Yeah, I think I would like this movie a lot better if it was just called Spirits Within.
<sergio_scriptor> LSD
<DrHobo> this isn't final fantasy!
<Thedude946z[Movie]> Silverscreen: Is Euro movie night The Friday movie night you missed?
<valoreins> see
<kempa> sergio_scriptor gimme gimme lsd! :D
<DerpStar> Cocaine its a hell of a drug
<alexxm> was the dream anything to do with the plot
<pony_zen> I see

<LordDerpington> Evening all.
<pony_7269> Interesting film,
<DrHobo> this looks more like Star Wars than anything e3e
<sergio_scriptor> Meanwhile: :D good one
<Dken2021> Meanwhile sounds like a final fantasy protagonist to me
<Lil_B> hi pony_zen DerpStar sergio_scriptor and Dken2021 ;)
<DerpStar> snap Meanwhile
<alexxm> hey Lil_B what have you been up to
<Kandarihu> The whole reason this game series even IS called Final Fantasy is because Square just made flop after flop out of every game they made. So they just decided to make one final game, a real fantasy game. And after that, they'd go out of business. The rest we know.
<Computer_Pony> Final Fantasy? :P
<Meanwhile> Dken2021: Fair point.
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The day and month shown after Aki's first dream (13 December) is director Hironobu Sakaguchi's wife's birthday.

<alexxm> hey LordDerpington hows your day been
<Kencolt> And if Saving the World isn't a FF theme, I don't know what is.
<PONY> News flash: Ketchup is not any better flavor on chips than Wasabi
<Meanwhile> Silverscreen: It's also my birthday. :3

<Darf14> Hello Science
<sergio_scriptor> That thing is google image project
<DerpStar> cool Silverscreen
<Lil_B> grafical wise this Movie was way ahead of its time, but they hadn't figured out how to proberly animate Skin in 3D (today they use multible layers and such
<PONY> Lil_B, isn't it nice when somepony greet's you, you get a ton of other greetings from others who thought you just joined? troll level's are at maximium
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Seiko wrist watch worn by Aki Ross (known as the "wrist halo"), which produces the map of NYC, is a digital recreation of an actual Seiko watch made specifically to tie in with the movie. A different design with numerous cosmetic changes was sold publicly.
<LordDerpington> Mm. This is pre-subsurface scattering, and it shows.
<Lil_B> PONY XD
<Alchemist> damn I derped my stream brbr
<Lil_B> PONY about GalaCON
<Kencolt> Dark92Enigma: No. Square was trying to make a movie using Final Fantasy themes-- story themes-- and did. Whethyer if a good movie is a matter of opinion.
<Meanwhile> Fireworks yaaaay
<DerpStar> Kinda omnitoolish no?
<Darf14> She has a Pipboy 3000 :)
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, they called it Final Fantasy because it was their final game, and it was a fantasy game. But it was a very original game.

<Silverscreen> 1,11It should be noted that we actually are close to developing the technology to make that watch, considering that when Iron Man premiered, the producers were told to make Stark's holograms more advanced to keep it more "futuristic".

<SirGanjalf> I like Euromovie night too, though it's not night
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Kandarihu> Funny. Everyone always says the black guy always dies first. But I can't think of one example of a movie in which that happens. Any examples of where this does?

<Obsidian> THey saved Fluttershy
<valoreins> Euromovie night in afternoon, you can't explain that!
<Silverscreen> 1,11Kandarihu: I think the cliche is more that the black man never survives.
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu It, Jaws 3D for example
<Om> This movie again I see
<The_Blazer> It's 8 pm here
<PONY> Obsidian, NICE
<beeep100> "Good thing im indestructible"
<mishia> What the
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, fair enough
<SirGanjalf> I'm a DOCTOR! Your argument is invalid!
<MadSurge> Trivia: this bombed so badly it forced Squaresoft to fuse with its longtime rival Enix just to not fail finantially!
<LordDerpington> Kandarihu: Aliens is probably the most famous example.
<Darf14> man, what a b****
<Dark92Enigma> PEOPLE!
<Lil_B> Reason Nr3. Stiff Dialoge, could need better Writing and Voiceacting :/
<Tovler> I didn't like Titan A.E. much. I don't stand a spirit of a chance at liking this movie.
<MusicalPony> wait, what movie is this again?
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge: im so sorry for them :(
<mishia> At least the conversation is very causal
<SirGanjalf> FF
<mishia> I like that
<sergio_scriptor> Sheppard ?
<Malavolent> Silverscreen: So Advent Children is better than this?
<DerpStar> Wrex
<SirGanjalf> Wrex?
<Alchemist> SilverScreen: except for the Thing. There out of about 12 people 2 are black and one of them survives :D
<Silverscreen> 1,11The one positive thing in this film: I like to think that those suits are how the Brotherhood Armor work in Fallout.
<Meanwhile> That guy has got THE squarest head I have ever seen
<alexxm> is his face supposed to be a twist or something
<mishia> Silverscreen this looks NOTHING like final fanstasy
<MusicalPony> MadSurge: what movie is this?
<Dark92Enigma> Love Interest Much?
<MadSurge> sergio_scriptor: for Enix, right
<Starflash> Silverscreen that was the first thing I thought about. fallout suits.
<MadSurge> '
<mishia> What the......
<PONY> So much... SCIENCE

<d3rb> Silverscreen, thats it, thats the one positive thing in the movie? :D
<Starflash> (\
<mishia> This film seems good....
<SirGanjalf> Fallout Fantsy?
<Kandarihu> Well, I'd like to look this up on TV Tropes. But my mom's watching, so I'm gonna have to look it up later.
<Nick> Derp
<Darf14> I was also thinking of fallout when watching this movie
<sergio_scriptor> sooooo...where is the fantasy ?
<Silverscreen> 1,11D3rb: That and dat ass.
<Lil_B> I would bash more now, But Spoilers prevent me :/
<MusicalPony> MadSurge: !!!!!!!!!!!
<mishia> BUT WHY CALL IT FINAL FANTASY?
<MadSurge> MusicalPony: Final Fantasy the Spirits Within
<Starflash> Fallout fantasy would be pretty awesome actually.
<MusicalPony> oh.
<Starflash> And yes, Advent children is better imo :T
<d3rb> cant argue with dat ass
<mishia> it takes place in THE REAL WORLD >:C

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The total production time on the film was over four years. By the time the final shots were rendered, some of the earlier ones had to be redone because they didn't match anymore. Also, the software used to create them had become more advanced (and hence more detail was possible).
<mishia> Calls itself Final Fantasy and then does DIS
<Tovler> so she's boring-Vasquez
<GilDash> PONY: BTW, I'm too busy watching Bronycon as I've seen this movie many times before. :)
<drf|laptop> 03hm

<Silverscreen> 1,11Kandarihu: You know, I actually think this is the most realistic and enjoyable scene in the film. It has a realistic conversation, some decent drama, and a surprisingly thrilling climax.
<Starflash> Alchemist: you underestimate the power of the potato.

<PONY> WE ARE ALL EXPERIMENTS OF GAIA
<LordDerpington> Cribbed from Jim Lovelock, really.
<mishia> What the
<The_Blazer> Who keeps an incinerator in his office?
<Lil_B> Illusion of Gaia was such a good game : (
<Kencolt> Finding eight spiritts-- item collection. Classic FF theme. Find all the crystals/weapons/whatever to save the world.
<Darf14> This diary sucks! *burns it fire*
<Meanwhile> The_Blazer: People who handle sensitive information?
<XAXpod> Good morning Shizuka. How was thou sleep?
<SirGanjalf> "This leads to bed."?
<mishia> You get JAILED for saying "the earth is not the center of the universe"?
<Darf14> I mean burns it in fire *Facehoof*
<Silverscreen> 1,11See, the concept of this story is clever and interesting. But the execution is so BORING.
<Meanwhile> mishia: Yeah, that's what happened.
<sergio_scriptor> i can't wait for when we will all by old and all the young people will be using holograms,and we are going to say"Remember of the books ? that was some serious shit"

<PONY> DerpStar, "small" is not a proper term in Science
<Alchemist> Silverscreen: would be better off as a live-action/animation hybrid rather than a full animationimo.
<alexxm> i rember seeing a trailer of this as a kid and i thought it was a live action movie
<FairysHuff> If you don't like it don't watch it.
<DerpStar> miniscule PONY
<Meanwhile> Ohai James Woods.
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT????? REALLY???? It's just like Little Nemi
<mishia> meawhile: if they are sensitive about spiritual things that people say, why do they get angry about SCIENCE?!
<sergio_scriptor> Sudently star wars prequel
<XAXpod> Wait a minute... is it euro movie night?
<Dark92Enigma> Little Nemo*
<Lil_B> Dr. Suess?
<EspyLacopa> Oh look, a Villain.
<sergio_scriptor> Sudently star wars prequel :|
<PONY> DerpStar, you believe Japanese Engineers are Miniscule?
<DerpStar> Is that???
<alexxm> obvious villian is obvious
<SirGanjalf> Well, to be honest animation still holds up kinda well
<Silverscreen> 1,11Alchemist: Most likely. Actual actors would have given more emotion. Over-doing it would have been beter than how they make everything so subtle. (hell, even teh villain is subtle by bad guy standards)
<Dark92Enigma> sergio_scriptor Your Lack of faith disturbs me
<Darf14> eeyup sounds like the bad guy
<DerpStar> Obviously explain how all their tech is so advanced?
<Tovler> uttery, *looks in a dictionary*
<mishia> Derpstar: Because
<mishia> Derpstar: just because
*Irish_Pony snores....
<Kencolt> alexxm: It's hard to say he's a villain-- he's rather like many FF antagonists who thinks he's in the right despite all evidence to the contrary.
<Dark92Enigma> Dark92Enigma That condo was in a very proper location.....20 miles to the beach, 20 miles to downtown
<DerpStar> ^^
<PONY> Tovler, false, should be looked up from Applebloom
<Alchemist> Silverscreen: the bad traits are obviousl because of th animation and not the writing.
<Viri> 14back

<Obsidian> Didnt he just say NOT to mention the "spirits" thing
<The_Blazer> Blow up the Earth with the Zeus cannon!
<sergio_scriptor> SirGanjalf: it reminds me alot of that movie "Battle for earth" when humans invaded an indigenous alien species...IT'S NOT AVATAR
<EspyLacopa> As in blowing up the planet.
<PONY> Death is not proper term in Science, please prefer word "Expire"
<mishia> The GIGA :D
<Dken2021> and only connection to final fantasy VII
<LordDerpington> "Rhubarb, rhubarb..."
<Dark92Enigma> That beam is nothing compared with the power of the Force
<EspyLacopa> Kinda like what Frieza would do.
<Meanwhile> And that guy has a giant forehead.
<Darf14> he should have lied about the alive part
<Dken2021> I think I know who the antagonist is...
<mishia> That voice-
<Obsidian> Or he could say it could blow up the planet
<mishia> THE VOICE
<Lil_B> They should all call Capitain Planet, Hero of Gaia
<Tovler> rhubarb rhubarb washing machine washing machine
<Alchemist> guy sounds a bit like James Woods
<mishia> OH GOD.
<Dark92Enigma> Your lack of faith disturbs me <.............
<SirGanjalf> sergio_scriptor: Avatar was the first thinh that came up to my mind when they started speaking about "planet's spirit"

<SirGanjalf> In my bra

<Lil_B> "you listen to me, stfu"
<SirGanjalf> flutterisbest: More like "OH MY!"
<Tovler> almost interesting dialogue that time
<sergio_scriptor> where is will smith when you need him ?! :|
<Obsidian> DOnt rely on luck, rely on fate instead
<mishia> Derpstar: No im calling that according to the film rules. Hes not an intentional Villian, just one made out to be because the movie doesnt know the diffrance
<AskDerpyDoo> OFFICIAL NAME is DERPY DOO confirmed in Song Script!
<Alchemist> flutterisbest: in that case I would like to examine that proof. deeply.
<Kencolt> Aki is the hottest actres who never existed.
<Lil_B> all at all the Stuff that isn't happening!
<Lil_B> just look at ti!
<DerpStar> I think the time for Will Smith has long passed sergio_scriptor
<mishia> Luck is random. Fate is always-
<AskDerpyDoo> the script of "Smile Smile Smile"
<mishia> Unditermable
<Irish_Pony> Im literally getting sleepy watching this =_=
<mishia> So boring
<DerpStar> He sounds like Kaidan Alenko from Mass Effect
<SirGanjalf> "SO NY"?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Irish_Pony: Oh, so I'm not the only one.
<Lil_B> 7th spirit, 6th element... its all the same
<Tovler> No Will Smith, then maybe Donald Faison?
<sergio_scriptor> DerpStar: i said that beacuse this new york reminds me alot from "i am the legend" new york :|
<mishia> "stran them for awhile"
<LordDerpington> Wait, Derpy wasn't in Smile Smile Smile. Her only appearance in that episode was inside the snow globe.
<Kencolt> mishia: Yes. He's a lot like game antagonists who are so damn certain that they are in the right that any evidence to the contrary is automatically wrong.
<mishia> BROMANCE?~?
<d3rb> derpy doo.....im fine with this
<The_Blazer> I think MLP has better facial expressions than this thing...
<Meanwhile> Dat stranded.
<Irish_Pony> Silverscreen: well it is a boring film :P
<LordDerpington> Isn't that a kind of eel?
*MadSurge is not very interested in this movie

<Alchemist> now KISS
<valoreins> ook...
<Dark92Enigma-2> PUMPKIN WHAT!
<sergio_scriptor> DerpStar: they need gordon freeman :P

<Meanwhile> Mother of muppets.
<Tovler> whoa. somebody almost raised their voice

<Silverscreen> 1,11They need a white mage.
<Obsidian> kirzstryfe: THe doctor is an NPC
<Everlasting_Joy> Vacation_Wrek: I'm working on that righ tnow.

<somepony_else> how did he like it?
<Darf14> Dang child safety locks!
<alexxm> sergio_scriptor he liked it and he's never heard of team fortress before

"Prototype" 8-channel soundtracks had been in use by SDDS since 1993, but the one for this movie is considered the first perfected standard of the format.

<Dark92Enigma-3> One more shot, eh?
<sergio_scriptor> so earth has his own world spirit ? :O i wonder what it looks like
<RaveBrony> 0 f__ks still given
<DocSane> This movie does make sense on its own terms. It lays out its plot and then ticks all the boxes in resolving it.
<Dark92Enigma-3> Evil begets more Evil
<DocSane> It's just that the plot is dumb.
*Dark92Enigma-3 inserts Batman and Robin climax

<Dark92Enigma-3> Everlasting_Joy which ''That''?
<alexxm> well that seemes to have helped
<DerpStar> since only a portion of the ghosts left their planet
<DerpStar> how many are left
<Tovler> The ghosts should have giggled at it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkies4thWall: well you asked for more friensdship
<Meanwhile> Overload the system. Good thinking!
<beeep100> Hes the SPAI
<beeep100> i think
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark92Enigma-3: Evil brings more evil.
<Obsidian> Forget Logic
<sergio_scriptor> why are bad guys always so dumb *_*
<DocSane> DerpStar: Probably quite a lot. These were just random ghosts that were linked to a chunk of their planet.
<PONY> becasue dumb is... bad
<SirGanjalf> In only Pinkie was around...
<Everlasting_Joy> sergio_scriptor: They wouldn't be bad then.
<Obsidian> sergio_scriptor: Becausr plot
<AttackWithHugs> sergio_scriptor: They didn't go to school to be a successful villain

<alexxm> whee
<GLaDOS> Hi guys
<DerpStar> You have to admit that hes very dedicated
<Kandarihu> sergio_scriptor, because they rely on their own sense of reason to guide them. They aren't spiritually aware like the heroes are.
<ZEC0RA> Why are they fighting Gaia Online?
<Dken2021> hai GLaDOS
*Dark92Enigma-3 LET'S GET OUR POWERS COMBINED!!!!!!
<DerpStar> hai GLaDOS
<mishia> Gaia is the orginal name of an "Earth Mother" or basicly the earth itself. It comes from Greek Mythology
<PONY> I choose you PIKACHU!
<somepony_else> hi GLaDOS
<sergio_scriptor> Kandarihu: true :(
<AttackWithHugs> Hey, GLaDOS

<SirGanjalf> hello GLaDOS
*Dark92Enigma-3 Gaia, essence of earth.........
<Dken2021> that's great, now turn Gaia into a magicite
<Obsidian> Yes it explains everything!
<sergio_scriptor> Kandarihu: i just whished that there would be a movie where the bad guy is smart and he wins,JUST 1 MOVIE :(
<Kandarihu> And that rule even applies in stories where the heroes are scientists and the villains are stereotypical religious people.
*Dark92Enigma-3 EARTH! FIRE! WIND! WATER! HEART!
<DerpStar> Empire Strikes back sergio_scriptor ?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6see, fuck escort missions

<sergio_scriptor> DerpStar: it works,kind of :|
<SirGanjalf> sergio_scriptor: No Country For Old Men
<The_Blazer> dream...

<mishia> So basicly the good guys are murdering the sprtiits
<DerpStar> Revenge of the Sith sergio_scriptor ?
<Pinkies4thWall> lol kirzstryfe
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Prior to the film's release, there was speculation that the photo-realistic computer-generated "actors" would revolutionize moviemaking. There were news reports of plans for the "digital actress" used for Aki Ross to appear in another movie, or possibly be included in a live-action production amongst real actors. The box office failure of this film put those plans
<sergio_scriptor> SirGanjalf: got see that movie someday
<Silverscreen> 1,11on hold, however a special sequence created for the special edition version of the DVD, which opens disc 2, does in fact show Aki and other FF characters interacting with real people.
<beeep100> owch
<Dark92Enigma-3> sergio_scriptor Empire Strikes Back?
<GLaDOS> dat wall
<DocSane> sergio_scriptor: Audiences don't like to see evil win, except if it leads to a sequel where the bad guys lose.
<AttackWithHugs> Suddenly tentacles
<sergio_scriptor> DocSane: indeed
<DerpStar> I already named that Dark92Enigma-2

<AttackWithHugs> AGE SPOTS!

*DerpStar tucks head in DoublePint chest and wimpers
<mishia> Im happy for that silver. For as pretty as these are, I find tradional needs to stay as it may become a dead and dieing art
<Dark92Enigma-3> Is Aki the New EVE?????? OH NO THIS IS Narutaru AKA Shadow Star ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<mishia> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<GLaDOS> Can someone tell me what the grape is going on?
<CriticKitten> It found me! Via the power of "the writers were trapped in a corner" logic!
<Meanwhile> GLaDOS: No.
<GLaDOS> y not?
<twilight_sprinkle> this sure is some badass graphics for 2001
<Lil_B> Can this guy move more of his Muszzles to create emotions?
*Dark92Enigma-3 JUST DO IT (insert Nike symbol)
<Obsidian> GLaDOS: She was the eighth spirit all along
<mishia> GLaDOS: why are you watching HOOMIN films robot-
<Meanwhile> GLaDOS: Because no one knows.
<alexxm> how do guns work against ghosts anyway
<mishia> Rarity: SHHHH the robot police are always listening?
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: Magic, (snort)(snort)
<mishia> !
<SirGanjalf> alexxm: Space Magic
<sergio_scriptor> alexxm: only god knows... :|
<Kandarihu> alexxm, it's probably the barrier in bullet form.
<Meanwhile> GLaDOS: Just sit by and enjoy that guys square head.
<Lil_B> DO NOT TOUCH
<Dken2021> alexxm if the guns were curing weapons and the phantoms were undead, probably
<Dark92Enigma-3> SO she was the eight spirit.........DEUS-EX-MACHINA much?
<mishia> XD
<Darf14> Its both science and space magic
<DocSane> alexxm: I think it's implied that the Phantoms are masses of bioetheric energy, and the guns fire blasts of the same, so it disrupts them.
<mishia> So they are killing innocent spirits?
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In an earlier version of the script, Cid and Aki were originally grandfather and granddaughter. Aki's last name was also different: she was originally Aki Shishido. The relationship and names were changed late enough into production that many of the animators and staff didn't even know of the modification of the script until the film was nearly finished.
<alexxm> thanks DocSane
<The_Blazer> Full powa!!
<twilight_sprinkle> mishia: theyre not really innocent
<mishia> Wait
<mishia> thats "cid"?
<Kandarihu> Any science that's sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.
<twilight_sprinkle> mishia: cid is the science guy
<sergio_scriptor> I KNOW!!!
<CriticKitten> I KNOW
<Meanwhile> He knows.
<Dark92Enigma-3> I KNOW
<Silverscreen> 1,11He knows.
<DocSane> alexxm: I base this on the fact that they were able to invade the city through the bioetheric energy conduits.
<Dken2021> I think he knows
<EspyLacopa> See Villain, this is why you don't kick Gaia in the nuts.
<SirGanjalf> WE KNOW!
<The_Blazer> Lol, who speaks to a computer?
<Dark92Enigma-3> I KNOW!

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Before Elliot Goldenthal was brought in to compose the score, the film was temp-tracked from James Horner's score for Titanic. Cues from the piece 'A Promise Kept' were borrowed for the original opening sequence and can be found on the Special Edition DVD.
<Dark92Enigma-3> I AM....VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!!!!!!
<Kandarihu> Right as the Zeus cannon is falling apart, my flash is crashing.
<twilight_sprinkle> goddamnit how is he a villain if he just gave his life to save people. hes just stupid is all
<mishia> Twilight_sprinkle Innoncence is confusion or the lack of being able to tell what is right from what is wrong
<Soital> 12this website is pathetic
<Kandarihu> Never mind. It's back up.
<CriticKitten> I love how the only reason this dangling plot thread gets resolved is because the villain is a tremendous moron.

<DerpStar> To the point of self sacrifice
<AttackWithHugs> CriticKitten: Idiots.
<GLaDOS> Why is it that 2 weeks ago you treat me like normal, I die for a while, come back and you all want me gone? What did I do?
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: for the greater good
<Kencolt> Villain isn't a proper term. Antagonist, however is.
<Dark92Enigma-3> Silverscreen Time for a game of dissapearing BEARS!
<mishia> twilight_sprinkle: Ignorance is bliss
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, the villain was only a basic character. The rest of the people who died were less defined than that.
<PONY> let there be...LIFE!
<sergio_scriptor> Silverscreen: "just beacuse i wanted to enslave all of mannkind that does not make me evil :'( "
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark92Enigma-3: :). Channel the Christopher Walken.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Twilight_Sprinkle: So does that mean the people in HOt Fuzz weren't villains since it was for the "Greater Good"?
<DerpStar> To save the world Silverscreen "ends justify the means" concept
<d3rb> soooo sleeepy -_-
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, I understand what you mean, though.
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: idk that movie.
<DocSane> mishia: I'm not sure if I buy that. Maybe that it's the state of not yet knowing what is "right" and "wrong."
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: You don't know Hot Fuzz? Dude. That film is awesome.
<alexxm> ok DerpStar
<RaveBrony> <3

<SirGanjalf> FOR SHIRE!
<Silverscreen> 1,11Alright then. Count Dooku from Star Wars: The CLone Wars was doing his thing because he thought it was for the Greater Good. Was he not a villain for that?

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In early storyboards, the character of Ryan Whitaker (voiced by Ving Rhames) was equipped with a cybernetic right arm, in what would have been a reference to the Final Fantasy VII video game.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: omfg would you stoptwisting everything i say. i mean that as long as they have an honest selfless reason and they think theyre helpign people, they not evil
<PONY> FOR THE GREATER GOOD!!!
<DerpStar> Silverscreen: I think that in a concept of a civil war perspectives have to be altered with regards to the factions
<Obsidian> Ummm what?
<Nerom> By the power of GRAYSKULL!
<DocSane> No, you're a villain so long as you are acting to contravene what the "hero" is doing in a story.
<Dken2021> Silverscreen if only that conecpt stayed...
<DerpStar> In this case the General wants to save the world
<Dark92Enigma-3> to IMCOMPRENSIBILITY...........AND BEYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOND
<Kandarihu> Bringing about world peace by inventing a world-destroying crisis like climate change to unite the youth against the elders who can't be deceived.World peace based on a lie.
<sergio_scriptor> Nerom: I HAVE THE POWERRRR!
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: count dooku was lying i think
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Who did this guy help?
<SirGanjalf> I WAS FROZEN TODAY
<Obsidian> Seriously, what just happened?
<RaveBrony> :D
<CriticKitten> Please, point to one single person that this guy HELPED in the course of the story.
<Meanwhile> Space Magic.
<PONY> Dooku was no villain
<Darf14> and thus the Ice age began
<DerpStar> Elements of Harmony?
<Dark92Enigma-3> WE WERE FROZEN TODAY
<mishia> sirhamjaif ohhh lordddu
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Oh, lord. Please don't drag real world politics into this.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: he THought this would help, he Honestly thought he was saving lives and he gave his own for it
<Silverscreen> 1,11DerpStar: In Clone Wars, Dooku was trying to save the galaxy from the "Tyranny of the Galactic Sennate"
<Ictiv> Obsidian: Science or Fiction. One of the two.
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Besides himself?
<GLaDOS> Ok then fine. Can anyone answer me this question? Do you like me on this chat or do I think I should go die in a hole? Yes or no?
<EspyLacopa> Ah, I see someone finally went ahead and cast Holy.
<DerpStar> Silverscreen: in the context of a civil war led by him
<Ictiv> Not sure if the writers know.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: He didn't even do that, he killed himself because DURR OVERHEATING WUT DAT, remember?
<alexxm> i like you GLaDOS
<sergio_scriptor> Silverscreen: it's all about perpective
<Kandarihu> Well, it's pretty much equivalent.
<PONY> Silverscreen, and what did his failure lead into?
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: there are two ways of that, either the emperor twisted his mind to believe it, or dooku was just lying
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Matt McKenzie, who voices the Major, is the only actor in the film to have also starred in a Final Fantasy game as he would later voice Auron in Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2.
<Darf14> warm ice? ..... seems legit
<mishia> Silverscreen: techincaly it was "tryanny" since the senate was not voted into thier place :)
<DerpStar> Silverscreen: Not to mention he was a double agent of the Galatic Senate
<RaveBrony> Harm :)
<twilight_sprinkle> HE WAS WARMED UP TODAY
<RaveBrony> *Warm
<RaveBrony> twilight_sprinkle: I lol'd :D
<FairysHuff> Darf14: Warm spirit
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Good point. Well, he did /try/ to destroy what he perceived as a hostile alien invasion that killed his family, but he was a twonk.
<Silverscreen> 1,11twilight_Sprinkle: and if he really believed it, woudl that make him the enemy or a hero? He still killed and risked millions of lives for "the greater good" he believed in.
<SirGanjalf> I like you too GLaDOS, don't jump in a hole
<PONY> Mewtwo was no Villain either
<Darf14> Theres that bird again
<Obsidian> Symbolism!
<SirGanjalf> Bird!
<EspyLacopa> Now, just imagine how much less of a disaster this would all have been if the Villain hadn't been so villainous.
<sergio_scriptor> i would tottaly join the empire,screw thye rebels
<flutterisbest> Hey birdy :D
<Kandarihu> That eagle. It doesn't care about what just happened among the humans at all. That guy's just looking for life.
<Nerom> Winter coming!
<CriticKitten> Yeah, it's pretty hard to say this guy wasn't a villain. Dude lied, stole, abused his authority, killed millions, and nearly blew up the planet because "aliens killed my family ;_;"
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: If he believed and he was ready to give his own life to make others live happy then yes
<PONY> Silverscreen, you can kill billions for the greater good. With that Logic, Stalin was a bad guy, but was he punished fpr his actions? Hmm?
<FairysHuff> I have this song on mp3.
<Meanwhile> How was that eagle not blown up by Zeus shockwaves?
<Dark92Enigma-3> JUST END THIS MOVIE
<rakka> sergio_scriptor: Yeahhhh empire!
<Silverscreen> 1,11PONY: That's exactly my point
<mishia> ....
<Darf14> it finally ended
<mishia> These hills-
<sergio_scriptor> 5.5/10
<alexxm> it just ended
<PONY> Silverscreen, Villains are chosen by vistors
<CriticKitten> See, this is a decent song, too.
<Lil_B> now lets see if Nobuo Uematsu is or isn't in the Credits
<EspyLacopa> For the "Greater Good" of who?
<mishia> so finnaly we see FINAL FANTASY hills
<Kandarihu> That eagle is an unchanging constant in this movie; a sign that after everything that happened in this movie, some things remained the same.
<PONY> Silverscreen: Victors*
<SirGanjalf> Neil/10
<Dken2021> Lil_B he isn't
<twilight_sprinkle> PONY: LOL except that stalin only desired power
<PonySpawn> Longest Cutscene ever. Bring on the Gameplay!
<SirGanjalf> ^:D
<mishia> ERRGHHH
<Lil_B> Sakaguchi was the Skript witer?
<DerpStar> I repeat the General wasn't a villain in this movie he was trying to achieve what we are seing now, at the cost of minimal sacrifices versus a plan that was ridiculously far fetched
<mishia> END THIS SUCK FEST
<CriticKitten> It's a shame the animation is so good and the music is pretty decent, but everything else is just so flat.
<alexxm> 5/10
<beeep100> NNNNNGGGGGG
<PONY> twilight_sprinkle: FOR THE GREATER GOOD :DDD
<Darf14> I rate this movie Science / Magic
<Silverscreen> 1,11You can do stuff "for the greater good" but that doesn't excuse being the cause of horrific event or action,
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: I think the movie already explained the point of the eagle in a simpler manner.
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: its a matter of means vs ends.
<DerpStar> 6/10
<EspyLacopa> The General, DerpStar, was a fanatic.
<alexxm> i don't like how it just ended
<Silverscreen> 1,11HE RISKED DESTROYING THE ENTIRE PLANET.
<Meanwhile> About three facial expressions/10
<sergio_scriptor> at least it's still better then Doom
<mishia> 4/10
<Obsidian> I wish I could stay to see the B movie. :(
<FairysHuff> Despite all the whining in chat I still enjoyed that.
<sergio_scriptor> 5.5/10
<kempa> I think this movie was more boring than footbal match between spain and portugal few days ago.. zzzz
<PONY> Silverscreen, the fact still remains, Villains are chosen by the victorious, disregarding everything else
<Harp> dancing to end a movie? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNp1qomWzz8&feature=plcp
<DerpStar> EspyLacopa: That doesn't make him a villain, Patton was a fanatic but not a villain
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: the planet was filled with Alien lifeforms he thought to be evil
<otakon> Hey guys
<ZEC0RA> What is the B movie?
<AttackWithHugs> No facial expressions/10
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, he didn't consider the destruction of the Earth to be a possibility.
<Silverscreen> 1,11He closed his mind to everything except destroying the Phantoms.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Harp, no video links during the stream please
<otakon> do me a favor and PING ME WHEN THE LOTTERY STARTS
<kempa> Hey otakon, how you doin
<GLaDOS> :| bye, i'm going to go play tetris for the next 5 hours and eat ice cream all day instead of getting a new job.
<Kencolt> alexxm: You mean... like a lot of Final Fantasy games, where you are honestly left with a dim sense of WTF? ^_^
<The_Browncoat> B/10
<sergio_scriptor> kempa: HEY,im from portugal :| just kiding im not mad :)
<alexxm> hey otakon hows your day been
<Lil_B> hey ther otakon :)
<otakon> kempa: okay
<Kammerjunk> ZEC0RA: "Tremors" from 1990.
<Meanwhile> Have fun GLaDOS.
<otakon> alexxm: alrighty
<otakon> so, brb
<CriticKitten> Yeah, I'm sorry if you don't agree, but the dude risked destroying the planet rather than acknowledging the very clear evidence presented by Aki that there were other options. >_>
<CriticKitten> He's a villain.
<DerpStar> Silverscreen: can that not be said of many contemporary generals in wars past?
<ZEC0RA> I love Tremors!
<EspyLacopa> What made him a villain was that his only real goal was revenge, and was willing to sacrifice -anyone- who stood in his way in order to get it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: well thats stupidity, not villainy, thats his mind, not his nature
<alexxm> Kencolt to be honest i ahven't played a final fantasy game yet
<mishia> <dem singers are theh boreds
<Silverscreen> 1,11So, all that youre saying justifies him destroying the entirety of what could have been humanitite's very last base of opportations, right?
<Dark92Enigma-3> OK.....to be fair, when you look at this movie from a different POV, IT's not the worst CGI movie out there, but it's still bad.....the plot and premise were creative, but the execution was TERRIBLE.....and i've never seen a more depressing ending since.........The Mist
<FairysHuff> Silverscreen: I love this song ^_^
<EspyLacopa> Remember when he intentionally took down the shields on that one sector?
<PONY> Silverscreen: FOR THE GREATER GOOD!
<Kandarihu> Anyway, some people are horrified by the idea of villains who believe that they're doing the right thing. I'm used to that happening. I honestly can't accept a villain who proudly proclaims how evil he/she is.
<mishia> Silverscreen: These are, after all...MAN!
<CriticKitten> Dark92: I wouldn't say the plot is that creative, per se.
<Dark92Enigma-3> JERSEY LEVELS/10
<Dken2021> this movie was pretty to watch, but pretty meh everywhere else
<DerpStar> Silverscreen: Well the thing is and they admited it that they held on to a veryu unpopular belief
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: how could it be their base of operations? it was filled with enemy lifeforms
<EspyLacopa> Remember when he put those two scientists in jail simply for trying to find another way of saving the world?
<kempa> sergio_scriptor well I am really sorry but that footbal was nothing againts ITAxGER, you have to admit it. Only the penalties were good :D
<CriticKitten> Dark92: But I agree, the animation quality is pretty amazing.
<Everlasting_Joy> Kandarihu: Those are the best villains, the ones who are so happy to be evil.
<mishia> MAN, YES MAN. HUMAN IN SHAPE BUT SATANIC IN SPIRIT-
<CriticKitten> It's just a shame it doesn't deliver more beyond that.
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: and who said there arent other planets
<PONY> Learn the facts; Good guys MAKE IRRATIONAL CHOICES
<mishia> :3O3
*Dark92Enigma-3 is about to mimick the NOSTALGIA CRITIC
<sergio_scriptor> kempa: indeeed my friend,and i was so sad my country lost :'(
<Lil_B> This movie gets a 4/10, lak of good characters, impressions ans Sounddesign
<Tovler> I was unable keep track of the story due to sleepiness.
*mishia dosent care
<Silverscreen> 1,11It justifies killing hundreds of innocent and hard working people just so he can shoot that canon, despite being given an alternative that had evidential proof of working.
<Lil_B> and poorly executed skript
<Dken2021> Dark92Enigma-3 you remeber it so we don't have to?
<Meanwhile> Everlasting_Joy: I'm inclined to agree with Kand, commited to being a cosmic scale douchebag isn't particularly interesting motivation.
<PONY> This movie gets; FOR THE GREATER GOOD/10
<FairysHuff> It amuses and saddens me that people are actually arguing about this.
<Chrysalis> Silverscreen but it wasnt a nice big gun
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: he didnt want to kill them >stupidity, if he Wanted to kill them, he would be a villain
<DocSane> Silverscreen: I think it's a fine example of script-induced stupidity.
<mishia> Silverscreen: he was trying at least. he was just being a retard-
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: To each their own.
<mishia> really, music, really?
<PONY> Silverscreen, would you destroy the sun to prove your point?
<mishia> REALLY?
<SirDeDerp> Hello everyone! what film did I just miss?
<kempa> sergio_scriptor yeah well your country beated my country one match earliers, so I was wishing for Spain :< :D
<mishia> :):):)
<Dark92Enigma-3> 4.5/10 Creative premise, terrible payoff, depressive ending
<Lil_B> mishia that sudden up-beat XD
<FairysHuff> Everlasting_Joy: Thankyou
<The_Blazer> Don't worry SirDeDerp, you didn't miss anything special
<DerpStar> FF Spirits within SirDeDerp
<Silverscreen> 1,11It went beyond irrational choices, he closed his mind to anything other than getting his way and went out of his way to make HIS way happen.
<Dken2021> lalli-ho SirDeDerp
<mishia> Lil_B dat music thinks its so good
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: stupidity isnt villainy, otherwise 90% of people is evil
<sergio_scriptor> kempa: which country was yours ? :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: And to be fair, there are a few villains I love who think they're doing a good thing, but are wrong/evil.
<CriticKitten> PONY: People need the Earth to, like, live. Risking blowing it up just to kill a perceived threat is stupid no matter how you slice it.
<SirDeDerp> Can't I still have the name?
<SirDeDerp> oh
<PONY> Silverscreen, that could happe to anyone
<SirDeDerp> nvm
<kempa> sergio_scriptor Czech Rep. :)
<Meanwhile> I don't mind the depressing ending, in fact I'm glad it ended like that instead of sudden deus ex love story.
<SirDeDerp> lol
<DerpStar> Silverscreen: Many people considered heros in history acted in similar ways
<Kandarihu> Accepting the viability of the alternative meant believing in something that he refused to believe in, namely Gaia. That's why pure reason and logic will never win out.
<Lil_B> wow, london symphony orchestra Oo
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: he was maybe arrogant but he wasnt evil, he wanted to save people and he didnt believe anyone else, he wanted to save humanity in His way
<sergio_scriptor> kempa: ah,in the name of my country ,im so sorry,but hey we both lost :)
<DocSane> Silverscreen: Well, he's an example of a character who dismisses any alternative ideas because they don't fit his preconceptions.
<Dark92Enigma-3> Dken2021 I plan to make a fanfic starring him...........and i will target the ''Elements of Harmony'' two-parter
<Darf14> I think the story was.... err... dang I cant remember the story of this movie >_<
<DerpStar> Had his plan worked he would have been recognized as such
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<DocSane> Silverscreen: Kind of like Twilight Sparkle, in that way.
<Dken2021> Dark92Enigma-3 uh... interesting?
<twilight_sprinkle> exactly, if it worked, youd all be singing a different tune.
<Meanwhile> He wasn't evil because he wasn't malicious. He was just a bad guy.
<SirDeDerp> aren't bad guys in films generally evil?
<twilight_sprinkle> he was just stupid.
<Dark92Enigma-3> Dken2021 Just a rough idea, i still need pointers
<kempa> sergio_scriptor you dont have to be sorry my friend! You were better, really better, and it was nice football to watch afterall, I enjoyed it though we lost. You were like 1 whole class better than us
<PONY> CriticKitten: I'm actually agreeing here in most parts... I'm just trying to say victorious choose the villains in EVERY concept and "good guys" make irrational choices too, other than that, I'm just fooling around
<Nerom> Still beter ending than ME3
<flutterisbest> This was an interesting film, I have to tell the truth though, I kept yawning through it
<CriticKitten> Again, a villain doesn't have to be in it just "for the evilz". Having a reason behind what you're doing doesn't excuse your actions.

<CriticKitten> All the same, the means you employ to achieve your goal are part of what makes them moral or immoral.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Good guys make irrational choices. But they don't justify themselves when those irrational choices have devistating effects, nore do that use that as an excuse to make MORE irraltional choices that can have just as many detrimental effects.
*Dark92Enigma-3 Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to. And welcome to another rendition of Raiders of the Story Arc..........(insert Indiana Jones knock-off)..........This is where I take the first few episodes of a nostalgic show and see if it still holds up. With that said, um...
<CriticKitten> Risking the planet's destruction is somewhat immoral.
<DerpStar> Ok everypony as a woman I veto all your decisions and call him a misguided hero
<PONY> I would destroy the sun to prove my point...
<DerpStar> the end
<Darf14> I wonder if there is even 1 movie where the bad guy wins
<The_Blazer> now what
*Dark92Enigma-3 MLP:FIM

<CriticKitten> ._.
<kempa> sergio_scriptor lawl north korea I think after that beating they put whole footbal team in jail, you know what is north korea about, right? Hard comunism :/
<Meanwhile> Thinking about it, I don't really think we can label the dude bad or good. He was a guy in charge of a lot of military decisions in a military situation who thought he knew the situation and acted accordingly. Except for the whole "Letting thep hantoms through the barrier" thing, that was just stupid.
<The_Blazer> yay
<Lil_B> evil=|=Villian, most evil persons are villians, but some are Villians because the want to be good but hurt others by doing so
<PONY> TL;DR
<The_Blazer> about ponies, is MLP streamed here in HD?

<beeep100> 20% cooler.
<Kandarihu> The stream's in 640x453 or something.
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: he Thought he was helping, but he was wrong. at that point there was nothing left but moving forward, otehrwise his previous actions wouldve been in vain
<Computer_Pony> Yay ponues
<Meanwhile> Kencolt: Being in the military long enough to get to that position tends to do that to people.
<DewlShock> twilight sprinkle: i'm actually watching that series atm. it really is good
<Dken2021> wait, Read it and weep was picked twice?
<FairysHuff> alexxm: I wouldn't mind a neck like that ^_^

<RaveBrony> D:
<PONY> Stalin was a Hero, and Finland is lying... They killed all the people Stalin was about to save before he could, and Stalin forgive them and didn't kill those pesky bastards. Finland had 90% casualties of all applied military perssonel and not a single soviet was hurt during the winter war.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: lelouche achieved piece His way, and it worked
<Darf14> Spider Dash Spider Dash, does whatever a Spider Dash does
<Dken2021> so... wait, was pony episode played after spirits within yesterday?
<Silverscreen> 1,11This guy put what he wanted over what was right. He wanted to kill the phantoms for the sake of getting rid of them at any cost. What was right was to try and get rid of them in a way that didn't have negative effects, as the scientists pointed it it could have, and he refused to listen to the idea of alternative options despite everyone else accepting them simply because he didn't
<Silverscreen> 1,11want them, rather than for what was right. He just pushed through for his own agenda.
<mishia> Spider dash, spider dash, does whatever a spider dash does.

<kempa> Dark92Enigma-3 I dont have soul
<Sonic_The_pony> FAIL D:
<sergio_scriptor> :(
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: The character was designed to be a villain. He risked the planet in a game of chance so that he could play with his giant phallic symbol of a weapon. All he needed was a twirly mustache and an evil laugh. :p
<PONY> Finland.. such a silly country

<Sonic_The_pony> CrimsonPhoenix hey :P/)
<Kandarihu> You know what? I just realized there's a second angle to what motivated him. He had that cool Zeus Cannon, and he WANTED to use that thing. This might have been less a case of the Ends Justify the Means, as the Means Justify the Ends.
<Darf14> OMG A CAT! :O
<CriticKitten> I'm the best predator. :3
<Barbetos> I always liked how daring do is just a rainbow dash recolor.

<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: he put the lives of all of humanity before individual lives, there wasnt really a case where he couldve helped someone much
<Kandarihu> Oh, this exact same imagery of all the animals converging on Daring Do repeats with the guards conversing on Rainbow Dash
<mishia> Cutie mark: Compus
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Like how people buy a BBQ and then invite the neighbourhood over every day for a few weeks to validate the purchase to themselves?
<MadSurge> Why didn't she fly .__.
<Sonic_The_pony> Daring have a brokeng wing?
<sergio_scriptor> FUN FACT: there exists indiana jones adventure novel books,they are called "the adventures of young indiana jones" :)

<MadSurge> I BECAME WHAT I HATE
<mishia> I love the shadding in this episode- everything feels liek a dream

<The_Blazer> Daring Doo is basically a reskinned Rainbow Dash... she even has the same eyes

<Meanwhile> The_Blazer: That's the point.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I can think of one. He found that video of Aki's dreams and could have just presented that to the council as evidence that his way was better. INSTEAD, he chose to lower the barriers and lie about it to make SURE they'd choose his way.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Ceiling Gators, your argument is invalid.

<Nerom> Just went for a glass of soda. My entire family turned their heads from the comps/Ios dev they played travan on and said join us. Creepy as hell O.o
<sergio_scriptor> monkey
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, that analogy is pretty much spot on in the case of a lethal chef who overcooks everything. Wiping out the bacteria at any cost.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo :3
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Mmmmm
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The 'golden oldie' playing in the Doctor's buried station wagon is a song by Bobby Bare, "Drop Kick me Jesus" - partial lyrics: "Drop kick me Jesus through the goal posts of life / End over end neither left nor to right / Straight through the heart of them righteous uprights / Drop kick me Jesus through the goal posts of life."

<sergio_scriptor> im not going to lie,the worm special efect as prety awesome
<otakon> nope...it's ded
<Meanwhile> He ded.
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Was originally given an "R" rating by the MPAA not for violence but for language. As an appeal, producers removed all utterances of the "f" word, with the exception of one - when Kevin Bacon says "Fuck you" to the dead graboid.
<sergio_scriptor> and its bufering...are you serious
<AgentKalim> Cold my ass

<AttackWithHugs> V
<sergio_scriptor> this is ridicilous,i cant watch anything beacuse of the lag
<HaberDash> 1 down 2 to go
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Composer Robert Folk was brought in at the very last minute to re-score the film. This was due to the original score composed by credited composer Ernest Troost was lacking the punch that it needed for the film musically. Approximately thirty minutes or more was written by Folk and strangely goes uncredited in the film's credits.
<Midnight_Fyre> Marx: Awesome, isn't it?
<Marx> I know!
<AvisTheArchaeopteryx> little winged raptors~

<Hawkie> 07Angel_Umbreon
<HaberDash> Midnight_Fyre I think I remember playing but I dont know where

<Hawkie> 07i wish i had an explanation to my sleep issue.
<Hawkie> 07going to bed very soon because no matter if i am dead tired or no, i wake up at 6am..
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kencolt, that picture has been in the internet for a god long while
<CrimsonPhoenix> I've seen it before
<Skylands> 10Because of the midnight sun you spoke of?
<Angel_Umbreon> 13My sleeping pattern is basically broken xD
<Silverscreen> 1,11Swapping the embed out to something else.
<Viri> 14o.o
<Midnight_Fyre> So I can finally devote my full attention to the movie again and it dies on me
<Kencolt> Has it? Not that I had ever seen. Certainly not framed and nearly six feet tall.
<Chimera> Also cool Sky
<Angel_Umbreon> 13if I don't have to get up early for anything the next day, I can easily stay awake until past 5am and sleep until 2-4pm
<CrimsonPhoenix> framed and nearly six tall yeah that was good
<Soital> 12DID I WAKE YOU UP
<Soital> 12I SORRY
<Hawkie> 07Skylands, ever since my boyfriend went to Cali, my body has been in sync with teh timezone there..
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I was happy THAT was the picture
<Angel_Umbreon> 13if I have to get up earlier, I still go to sleep at like 2-3am regardless .w.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13SOITAL

<Hawkie> 07it makes me sound ridiculous
<otakon> Eeyup-Big MacIntosh
<Kencolt> If by extreme lag you mean a constant buffer, well. he's trying to switch embeds.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13it's silly cuz I heard we were finishing an hour earlier than usual today for stocktaking
<The_Blazer> Wich means?

<Quick_Thinker> damn
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "graboids" are very reminiscent of the giant worms in Dune. Both are giant worms, live underground, live in the desert, have large mouths on the end, and respond to vibrations on the surface. Also, both films have the characters escaping the worms by retreating to rocks where they can't get attacked.
<AgentKalim> NNNNEVERRRRR
<turtlegod98> oh yea, I saw this film before, kinda forgot some bits of it.
<otakon> damyun
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> aliens: nom nom nom!
<FairysHuff> Know what this vaguely reminds me of because of it's 80s feel? The movie series Critters.
<Meanwhile> Pipe bomb out.
<AgentKalim> Household chemicals
<AgentKalim> seems legit
<otakon> Silverscreen: apparently they got ideas from the Mongolian Death Worm...which is also a movie on Sci Fi Channel
<sergio_scriptor> Silverscreen: not to mention the book" it came from the desert" that features giant ants instead of worms
<hen3ry> AgentKalim: consider WHICH household we're talking about tho
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm CM PUNK PIPEBOMB!
<Kencolt> And does that Burt the Kwizatz Haderach?
<turtlegod98> Aliens:pipe bomb delicious! Want more!
<Quick_Thinker> well he did say its weighs 30 tons
<otakon> FairysHuff: same here, we should watch Critters here
<PONY> pardon my french
<alexxm> otakon everythings a sci-fi channel movie
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> This movie reminds me of that movie "Signs", the one with Mel Gibson.
<RAWRity> This is terrible, yet I can't stop laughing: http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/179142_331062906978200_691146167_n.jpg

<LordDerpington> Derpy put down that controller. You are a pony. It's not even made for hooves.
<The_Blazer> You should stream Team Fortress 2 or CSS

<Drinky_Kraw> "I like (everything about the fandom) but I am not a brony."

<AgentKalim> Dance, Mario dance
<Apokalipse> Yes, hump the numbers!
<RockingRazor52> LIKE A BOSS
<USS_Sulaco> thank you turtlegod

<Kandarihu> Scrolling smoothly in every direction was mostly mastered as of this game. Music that doesn't compete with sfx for channels wasn't accomplished by then.
<turtlegod98> stalin it is!
<Stonegaze> Oh you dirty bastard..
<CloudNine> PICK. A. BOX.
<turtlegod98> communist or capitalist?
<Alchemist> wow, my play session took longer than expected... But thats the magic of a good game :)

<ekips> maybe he is getting 2 whistles to get to the last level Stonegaze
<turtlegod98> communist or capitalist?
<AgentKalim> Nuclear waffles.

<NullRadix> Caramel: Alchemist's bronycon picture up there
<Chrysalis> Ohai Val!
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah...I'm not at bronycon :P
<Kandarihu> Oh, you think this game is hard, try playing Abadox with no save states.
<CloudNine> :P
<Tatergattler> OOOHHHH!!! WHERE EVER MARIO IZ HIDING, HE'S GOOD!!!
<Alchemist> NullRadix: not mine, I found it.
<NullRadix> you posted it, your responsibility!
<turtlegod98> DAMNIT! No one's paying attention to me any more!
<Alchemist> damn
<CloudNine> MARIO
<Chrysalis> im sorry, i wasnt paying attention
<Kandarihu> Er, you think JSMB2 is hard, Abadox will swallow you whole, and just hope it will spit you out.
<Chrysalis> what did you say? :P
<CloudNine> Derpio
<Kandarihu> Er, you can just hope it will spit you outs
<Kandarihu> out
<turtlegod98> I like bananas.
<Tatergattler> dat whistle
<turtlegod98> and the number 98.
<Dashite> Aw yeah. Underground theme.
<NullRadix> you have two whistles. why aren't you using them?
<diddutz> all the secrets
<Tatergattler> sprites who are defeated have noclip capabilities
<MahBoi777> oh man I love dis game
<flutter_spin> he needs more gas to 'toot' them
<CloudNine> ... Mario is a pegasus?
<CrimsonPhoenix> MLG
<ekips> oh, just getting the whistles for prestige and not for the shortcut to the last level SuperBrony64?
<Kandarihu> CloudNine, flying racoon

<FairysHuff> turtlegod98: Easy. Ignore everything negative anyone ever says about what you enjoy and just enjoy it.
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: You awake?
<ponyloverforeva> nope
<ponyloverforeva> im half asleep
<FairysHuff> Is there meant to be something streaming?
<Dashite> Did he dieded?
<turtlegod98> I ignor everything in life. no fun.
<Kandarihu> Well, you have to stand up for what you love.
<AgentKalim> Whatever that might be.
<FairysHuff> turtlegod98: It's either that or get into arguments with idiots over nothing
<operatorPony> who is streaming?
<NullRadix> turtlegod98: no one can tell you precisely what you need to do. You need to decide on a goal for yourself and do everything you can to accomplish it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> SuperBrony64
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> is
<noname> is?
<Kandarihu> I'll bet he's out getting something to eat.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> yup
<FairysHuff> operatorPony: Aparently no one. I just have some weird netflix screen freeze
<NullRadix> and thats the short version. I'm kind of doing a minor workout
<Kandarihu> It's not a freeze. His Wii is idle.
<ponyloverforeva> ive got a question...
<ponyloverforeva> what is sleep?
<FairysHuff> Kandarihu: Well now I want to watch a western O_o
<noname> ponyloverforeva: something to do with closeing your eyes
<ponyloverforeva> ok...
<diddutz> turtlegod98: If you want to make your life better, i'll start by eliminating what makes your life worse and how you do that depends on what it is
<AgentKalim> Well, now I want to watch the next episode of Bob's Burgers before going to sleep.
<ponyloverforeva> same
<FairysHuff> ponyloverforeva: Sleep is the thing that makes all the bad stuff in reality go away.
<turtlegod98> I do. I want to make music but their are two things blocking my path. 1 is me not knowing how to play any intruments (but that can be overcomed) and 2 is I have no money to afford ANY musical instrument. I'm put in a deep hole in the earth and i'm still trying to crawl out of it. So far it's a losing fight.
<ponyloverforeva> FairysHuff: but arnt there night mares to scare you in your sleep?
<Spell-of-Gaming> OH GOD
<AgentKalim> What? :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> BRONYCON AUCTION, TWILIGHT CANNON!
<FairysHuff> ponyloverforeva: Nightmares aren't real. And fear is only an emotion. Reality is hard, cruel and very very physical. I prefer sleep
<ponyloverforeva> i know
<Dashite> It moved@
<turtlegod98> Also I can't make good videos.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Suddenly Burgers
<NullRadix> turtlegod98: a) don't stop fighting. get a job. if you're that far in debt I'm pretty sure there are programs to help, but I dont know them off the top of my head. 2) if you dont have an instrument I believe there are music programs that can emulate instruments
<ponyloverforeva> yay its back on!!
<AgentKalim> The Horse.... Renderer?
<AgentKalim> I couldn't read the last word on the right building
<Twilicious> O.o
<Dashite> The Horse Renderer, right beside the burger place.
<turtlegod98> I'm 14. can't get a job
<Irish_Pony> xD

<NullRadix> babysit, offer to mow lawns or help with other projects, smaller stuff
<turtlegod98> only £18 a week besides my father wont let me. not sure why.
<oni_link> turtlegod98: do chores and babysit in your community

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> oh god
<JESmith71> I know but someone had to make an MLP joke out of it
<AgentKalim> JESmith71: That's probably because of copyright. There's totally MLP stuff in there, they just didn't show it.
<JESmith71> Oh I know I was joking
<turtlegod98> wat?
<oni_link> Kandarihu: this does not please me :|

<Rex_Mundi> She probobly is related to Celestia... somehow, and I bet that there are 2 types of Alicorns, Celestia and luna are greater Alicorns, but there are also "'lesser Alicorns', like candence, who are still rare but not nearly the same level.

<JESmith71> Tara's probably best person involved in the show interacting with the fandom (Well I mean de Lancie's cool for doing the documentary, but he doesn't do the crazy fun interactions that Tara does)

<nickstr> but not as long though
<Ingwaz> icybeauti: i'm thinking worse, however, apparently the first wasnt that well received audience wise. i feel this new one is sticking less to the actual comic and just trying to be more mainstream...which disappoints me

<Spade-Magnes[R]> What language is the title theme in anyway?
<Sumica> 00,10ahh
<AgentKalim> I don't know all the lyrics. :P
<Ghost30k> Ingwaz: the story, it's just you can't view it on FiM fic
<AgentKalim> Spade-Magnes[R]: Latin, obviously. :P
<Marx> Oh yeah, you mean that Homebrew Channel thing?
<Sumica> 00,10Flutershymarth looked kinda cool
<Ingwaz> Ghost30k: well, whats the story about? a basic synopsis
<Kandarihu> I don't know how to approach lag-related issues from now on. All I know is that I shouldn't do what I did today.
<Ghost30k> Ingwaz: here i'll pm it to you
<CloudNine> Ow, my braces... X.X
<icybeauti> CloudNine: Just got them on?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I still dont see how Meta Knight is broken

<Spade-Magnes[R]> A scene was cut of the Subspace campain
*drf|laptop watching the movie Source Code
<CloudNine> icybeauti: Not sure...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> It was supposed to show Meta Knight's ship getting captured
<Ingwaz> Ghost30k: having trouble with the pm?
<Kandarihu> So you went and fixed it for everyone else and some of the people had lag who didn't have it before. And my lag was terrible.
<icybeauti> CloudNine: Still, it'll be worth it when you get them off and your teeth look kick ass.
<CloudNine> XD
<JESmith> Four ways to play, but the Gamecube controller is the only good one
<icybeauti> ^
<noname> does anyone actually use the wii controler in smash bros? Or does everyone use the gamecube controler?
<Ghost30k> Ingwaz: no i was just typing it out
<RainbowDerp> Why are we watching how to play?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I use the classic controller
<Kandarihu> Anyway, I tried to bring this up, but nobody noticed it.
<icybeauti> noname: I used GCC most of the time, but I was decent with the remote and nunchuck
<Ghost30k> wow i should try to become staff so i can show me playing revelations
<GanondorfKidDisiplin> SuperBrony64: Get Project M already :P
<Ghost30k> :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02GanondorfKidDisiplin: Maybeh :3
<icybeauti> I would love to join the mod squad. But I don't know if I'd have time to do 9 hour streams.
<AgentKalim> OVERWHELMING!
<alexxm> night guys
<CloudNine> OH YEAH, HEEEYAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<d3rb> bye alexxm
<Spade-Magnes[R]> How is the pokemon trainer breathing in space?
<Vordox> Project M = The salvation of competative Brawl
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Project M?
<CloudNine> :T
<Vordox> Spade-Magnes[R]: Yep
<AgentKalim> What's Project M?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You don't have to stream if you don't want to as a Mod, but even if you do want to, you can stream for as short as 30 min if you want :3
<Vordox> http://projectm.dantarion.com/
<RainbowDerp> -_-
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Isnt that what Other M was code named?
<Chimera> xD
<icybeauti> That would be cool. But I don't have all the webcam software and stuff :P
<turtlegod98> i regret trading in my wii for a ps3.
<Kandarihu> I gave up when I was in that grey area between going too far to get my problems addressed, but not going far enough to successfully gain attention.
<Vordox> Wait.. I can stream without being a mod, SuperBrony64 ? :P
<drf|laptop> 03this is... interesting
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Sound?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I said as a Mod silly :)
<JESmith> Same reason all the characters breathe in space in the Star Fox stage. Or how Mario breathes in space in Galaxy.
<Appleshine> ?
<noname> sound just went full derp
<JESmith> No reason they just can
<icybeauti> My friend would love to stream. She would do drawing like wrek
<Taeguk> oh.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Also how can Sonic breath in space but not under water?
<operatorPony> PRINCES SPEACH!
<CloudNine> :3
<AgentKalim> Mr. Gayman watch
<Jim> Not Mr Game and Watch!
<operatorPony> is he OPed?
<Jim> He's so bloody hard to play as
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You can join the game if you want :)
<operatorPony> PLAY AS PEACH!
<icybeauti> He should play with Zelda or even snake,
<AgentKalim> That makes it all the more rewarding. :P
<JESmith> Well in Generations he can but you need that Red Ring Power Up
<noname> why does no one like mr.game & watch :(
<icybeauti> oh dis place...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Classic Sonic is so weird using the Homing Attack
<AgentKalim> LA LA LA
<CloudNine> >:3
<operatorPony> wtf is happening?
<Jim> This looks modded
<Spade-Magnes[R]> A battle of clones
<AgentKalim> Clone wars :P
<icybeauti> When I would play with my brothers, we never used items.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> But seriously you can just break Classic Sonic stages with the homing attack
<Kandarihu> I've also wanted to stream too. But I'd have to wait at the end of a long line of other people who would like to stream. And by the time my turn comes up, something terrible will force the mods to stop allowing non-mods to stream.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Aaaaaaaa, ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THE INTERNET IS DOWN!
<Jim> IT BEGINS
<JESmith> Spade, yeah and the fact that in the 3DS version you get the Homing Attack in the story and you have to use it in the later stages to get through
<VenHur96> What's happens? Why can't I watch the steam?!
<d3rb> almost everything?
<icybeauti> It's a hot day. The electrcity is screwy.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Reddit and Livestream are down
<VenHur96> Everything expects Google and Youtube for some reason! I don't know why!
<JESmith> Kind of messes up the point of playing as Classic Sonic
<Spell-of-Gaming> And I think Instagram is still down
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Well its still interesting to use
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Its just odd
<CloudNine> LA
<Kandarihu> This is one awesome stage.
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony

<Spell-of-Gaming> For the last time, OctaviaxScratch is NOT canon.
<d3rb> damm
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I wonder if their going to use a different art style for Link for smash 4
<icybeauti> THERE'S A SMASH 4?!?
<operatorPony> They should.. even thoguh I wont pay it
<The_TerraFirma> More likely they will have 3 different links
<Spell-of-Gaming> I see no point in OctaviaxScratch
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's going to be a smash 4 for Wiiu AND 3ds
<icybeauti> Dayum
<The_TerraFirma> ...
<The_TerraFirma> Sinistar?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Dark Pit for Smash 4

<diddutz> Spell-of-Gaming: i see no point in the whole idea of those cards
<The_TerraFirma> It looks like isnistar
<icybeauti> I want it!
<The_TerraFirma> sinistar
<operatorPony> Spade-Magnes[R]: Pit is Sexah

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Maybe they should add a Galaxy Stage
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^
<Kandarihu> Thanks for streaming.
<Crono_brony> They probably will.
<VenHur96> Good Egg Galaxy or that one with the Mario 3 Overworld tune.
<XAXpod> I didn't watch, but thanks SB :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02They should add a stage that switches between all the stages every minute or so
<Drinky_Kraw> I am disappoint. There is no pratchett-styled whooves yet.
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Oh god..no
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Call it 'Smash Museum'
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: they should make a stage of equestria
<VenHur96> I didn't get to see what was going on due to the maintancing, but thanks anyways, SB64!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Np ^-^
<Kandarihu> If Namco/Bandai is co-developing the next Smash Bros, I wonder if we're going to see SRW OG characters in it?
<VenHur96> I has a strange feeling they're adding Tamagotchi or Digimon characters...jk jk.

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Megaman needs to be in smash bros
<drf|laptop> 03so BlueFlare I bought that Panasonic camera
<Drinky_Kraw> Digimon could work depending on who it is. Then you could finally fight a Digimon vs a Pokemon
<Spade-Magnes[R]> He certainly isnt doing anything right now <.<
<Marx> That "Smash Museum" idea sounds pretty cool.
<BlueFlare> 02oh nice
<BlueFlare> 02do you like it so far?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Final Smash: Power Pellet = "Turns all enemies blue and makes them super weak while you grow 2x your size"
<Drinky_Kraw> So how is this for an idea. One of Dr Whooves' machines blows up in his face.
