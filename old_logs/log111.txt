<RAWRity> combustiblelemons PREPARE YOURSELF. FOR I WILL END YOU.
<Zephirdd> sweetie belles voice = best voice
<Combustiblelemons> there isn't a twilight meme though
<Spectrum> so is crylight sparkle
<Zecora> dat long neck
<interior_gummy> sweetiepoo
<Denied_Existence> And now it sounds like a gospel choir
<prince-dari> All I have to do is set up some DNS entries on our domain pointing to to the free host site.
<Combustiblelemons> D:
<Spectrum> i'm waiting for pinkie cry
<Rezo> HEAVY FUCKING METAL
<RobotPinkie> YEOW
<Spectrum> There is a twilight meme.
<Aponymous> Sweetie Belle and Rarity have the best singing voices. This is no coincidence.
<Spectrum> ^
<PrincePOLO> Scootaloos are on loose!
<Spectrum> wait
<RAWRity> aponymous this is law
<Spectrum> you forgot fluttershy in that,.
<Combustiblelemons> I mean this RAWRity
<Combustiblelemons> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/7d5305a416b686f8c401c3cea810dd85/49666%20-%20drag%20dragging%20dumb%20hover%20hovering%20hoverity%20rariquest%20rarity%20rock%20traveling.jpg
<EmmettBrown> Well,the space law article was very short,so I'm back on the moon
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright.
<SomeBrony> STARE
*Luna is a bit blonde but does that mean a redirection? they enter the domain name and get transferred to the free host?
<interior_gummy> get over here asshole
<mib_ftkbft> someone just got serious
<prince-dari> No.
<Octavia> 14I love the Rarityquest pics, awesome <3
<mib_8jge03> Rarity's voice actor is actually on of the only ones that doesn't sing for her character
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/KSHKIw
<Purple`Prose> KOYANINISQUATSIIIIIIIIII~
<prince-dari> They are two different services.
<EmmettBrown> The Moon's regular phases make it a very convenient timepiece, and the periods of its waxing and waning form the basis of many of the oldest calendars
<Luna> 07-Listens-
<Navy_Brony> lol purple
<SirReginald> no wings?
<prince-dari> The service we are paying for is the computer hosting our domain
<RobotPinkie> Different person who sings Rarity's songs than who does her voice, of course...
<mib_12klvl> It forms the basis of our modern calander
<RAWRity> Twilight's VA doesn't do here singing either
<SirSprinkles> 6It requires a bit of computer and server/client setup knowledge to really... understand.
<prince-dari> The other free service will be hosting the website itself, all the files, etc.
<scatr> fluttermedic is best medic
<Riders> Well bronies, I'm out. See y'all in 3 or 4 hours for Giant Robots.
<RobotPinkie> Pretty sure most of the singing voices are different from the talking voices...
<SirSprinkles> 6Though dari put it as simply as possible. XD
<PrincePOLO> how about flutterturret?
<Luna> 07I see
<Combustiblelemons> it exists
<scatr> i am unaware of flutterturret
<scatr> :o
<prince-dari> It will take 2 days max to get the domain set up.
<Zephirdd> too quiet!
<RAWRity> I'll see you guys later too, I've gotta go get a shower, than finish up my NaPoWriMo for the day, then bowling.
<Rezo> One or two sigRainbow Dash sings herself I think
<Ziltoid> but flutterturret is aware of you
*Nittany_Tiger nukes moon.
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/UkI9Sf
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, so the next thing on the list was going to be paying for the domain registration, but seeing as it's ridiculously cheap, we'll just skip over that.
<Luna> 07NO!
<Aponymous> I wouldn't be able to kill a Flutterturret...
<Combustiblelemons> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/127f50710563de166b6a3bc94a98b8cf/26779%20-%20.jpg
<Luna> 07not my home!
<interior_gummy> pinkie needs at least 20% more songs in s2
<Combustiblelemons> see flutterturret ^_^
<Zephirdd> Luna: I thought it was your prision?
<prince-dari> Because once I update it with the host's information (takes a minute) that has to spread all across the internet to several main DNSs.
*Rezo can pass on pinkie songs
<Rezo> Needs Twiliught and Rarity solos, though
<scatr> ohhhhh
<prince-dari> It will likely take less than 2 days though.
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, so next is the setup of our own chat server.
<ThePretender> I missed The Stare? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DAMN YOU LUNCH
<scatr> get it now, hehe
<prince-dari> 1 day probably.
<Luna> 07I like to return there once in a while
<Nittany_Tiger> Oops.
<prince-dari> Chat server is all set up.
<Combustiblelemons> Please walk in front of my laser- if that's ok with you i mean, because um... *squeal*
<prince-dari> If you mean IRC>
<Luna> 07the view is beautiful!
<prince-dari> IRC*
<Ziltoid> pinkiw songs are amazing
*DecapKing hugs Luna
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> IRC.*
<Trooper7psp> inb4 scootachicken
<Luna> 07no cap?
<TheBatman> fail.
<PrincePOLO> inb4 chicken jokes
<ThePretender> Scootlaoo! SCOOT-SCOOTLOOOO!
<Ivan> <3
<Zephirdd> CHICHCIHCICHICHICH
<SirSprinkles> 6You said we'd probably need others to work as servers aswell, since your computer may not be able to handle it.
<SirSprinkles> 6There's Silver. XD
<NightShade> for resterday's sake...
<Dark_Horst> TREEBEARD!
<prince-dari> Well we've got Wrek hosting a server as well.
<Nittany_Tiger> Humans go back to the moon, find hoofprints.
*NightShade hugs Luna
<The_Si> Cheep cheep cheep.
<Dark_Horst> he'S a fillychaser, that old log
<Combustiblelemons> XD treebeard
<SirReginald> lol, Tiger
<prince-dari> Val could too, but he hasn't got his desktop.
<SirSprinkles> 6How many do you think it'll hold across both servers?
<Spectrum> ffff
<prince-dari> No one else has their PC on 24/7.
<prince-dari> I have no idea.
<scatr> cutie mark crusaders as hobbits
<interior_gummy> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS CONGRESSMEN!
<Octavia> 14I can
<Veewave> They're on the search for the royal turducken.
<ValtheJean> I sent a voice message back home, but they haven't gotten back to me
<prince-dari> Which is why I was gunna test it this week.
<Spectrum> i went away for like 2 seconds and missed SCOOT-SCOOTALOO
<Wrek> 05which is why we wanted a stress test right?
<prince-dari> This BMN.
<Octavia> 14But not until after I move soon.
<Ziltoid> DEAD
<The_Si> Cutie Mark Crusaders Ring Bearers YAY
<SirReginald> inb4 stoned jokes
<prince-dari> But I had to get our information set up with the IRC opers.
<PrincePOLO> Dumb rock!
<mib_12klvl> TWILIGHT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<ThePretender> and then Twilight was a rock
<prince-dari> mibbit IRC opers*
<interior_gummy> I WAS FROZEN TODAY
<Combustiblelemons> you broke her!
<Spectrum> real funny fluttershy. 'don't go anywhere'.
<prince-dari> Because otherwise mibbit wouldn't work on our server.
<SirSprinkles> 6We may be able to get a stress test set up with a big event of some sort... =/
<Trooper7psp> teh pokemon movie
<Spectrum> DEAR PRIMCESS CELESTIA
<RobotPinkie> I'd like to be a rock...
<Spectrum> I WAS STONED ALL DAY IN THE EVERFREE FORESTY
<Spectrum> *FOREST
<Trooper7psp> a four leaf clover
<Ivan> 4chan leaves
<ValtheJean> well
<Zephirdd> lmao
<EmmettBrown> Moon trivia time
<Rezo> Twilight pwn'd
<herospirit> ... it is pretty silly.
<mib_12klvl> Lawyer badge
<Denied_Existence> AHAHAHAHA Spectrum
<EmmettBrown> The very fist moon rover
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Lunokhod_hires.jpg
<Spectrum> =D
<interior_gummy> the gop elephant?
<ValtheJean> I know a lot of people have been asking for a full S1 stream before S2
<ValtheJean> that could be our big event
<Nittany_Tiger> A trollface.
<Rezo> XD
<Nittany_Tiger> XD
<Spectrum> =D
<Ivan> If she saw one of them cocks, she would laugh at how silly it was.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, but I was hoping to do that very close to S2...
<SirSprinkles> 6Which wouldn't give us much time.
<Ziltoid> ugh
<Spectrum> ^
<Spectrum> So ture.
<Spectrum> *true
<interior_gummy> never look it in the eye, 'else it'll spit milk in your face!
<herospirit> The very first moon rover looked like a steampunk war tank? :0
<Trooper7psp> no, isee three
<ValtheJean> well yeah, we could do it the week of S2's premiere or something
<ValtheJean> like monday-friday
<Nittany_Tiger> It's Soviet.
<Rezo> Fluttershy knows her cocks
<mib_ftkbft> just drug them
<DrFumbles> lol
<Spectrum> also, this cockatrice just went basilisk on their plots.
<Rezo> I bet she's seen many cocks
<mib_ftkbft> lots of drugs will do trick
<SirSprinkles> 6But we need to make sure it's up and running ASAP.
<SirReginald> lol
<Veewave> snail
<SirSprinkles> 6We don't have the kind of time for that.
<Ivan> Snails why?!
<Denied_Existence> *KZZZZZT* CHICKEN DOWN, I repeat, CHICKEN DOWN
<ValtheJean> hmmm good point
<Rezo> SO MANY COCKS
<Veewave> !
<The_Si> Sweetie Belle's screaming broke my stream.
<SirSprinkles> 6I was thinking a restream of LotR at Euro appropriate hours.
<mib_ftkbft> oh gawd
<PrincePOLO> Where was Gondor when the stare?
<Luna> 07ohh yes
<SirSprinkles> 6Monday-Wednesday
<mib_ftkbft> dont let me ever catching you doing my mother again
<EmmettBrown> This is what the moon does over the course of a month
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Lunar_libration_with_phase_Oct_2007_450px.gif
<Nittany_Tiger> Doesn't the cockatrice's mother turn things into stone as well?
<Combustiblelemons> Yes... fluttershy....
<Trooper7psp> dat scoot face
<SirSprinkles> 6Gives us a day to promote it.
<Ivan> Fluttershy rolled a natural 20 on her intimidation roll
<Ziltoid> STAIR MASTER
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, a day and a half.
<ThePretender> TITLE DROP
<mib_ftkbft> lol
<Zephirdd> wud happnd
<scatr> i told you about the stares bro
<Spectrum> nice one Ivan.
<Navy_Brony> Aha, I see what they did there!
<Trooper7psp> lololol doodoo

<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<AngryJohn9000> hi
<mib_ftkbft> smack that bitch
<interior_gummy> dat threat
<prince-dari> I'm gunna be back at school Monday.
<Combustiblelemons> would the stare work on other ponies?
<Denied_Existence> Ok, now writing EmmettBrown x Moon shipping
<AngryJohn9000> is spam allowed on mibbit?
<ValtheJean> my only concern is that it wont be a stress test anywhere close to what S2 will be
<EmmettBrown> So Twilight,how was it being turned to stone
<prince-dari> I'm gunna have a LOT less time then.
<Rezo> Fluttershy dominates teh cock
<mib_ftkbft> lol
<Trooper7psp> yes she would
<SirSprinkles> 6It would be like, 7 PM your time, dari.
<interior_gummy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC8zz95rm8s
<EmmettBrown> "You don't know man,you weren't there"
<Spectrum> Fluttershy has a +9001 charisma modifier.
<pottsi> no
<Ivan> I wonder if she could cause a staregasm
<AngryJohn9000> there is lot of spamming on #archlinux-ru
<prince-dari> And it would go on very late.
<mib_ftkbft> UMADRARITY?
<Ivan> Its so true.
<AngryJohn9000> i can show some logs if you're interested
<SirSprinkles> 6Not doing the episodes.
<mib_ftkbft> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Just the movies.
<DrFumbles> did you finish those errands?
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Wrek> 05welcome to our world
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Combustiblelemons> if you were fluttershy, what would you do?
<mib_ftkbft> the irony in what she said
<Dark_Horst> hse CONTROLLS THEM
<Denied_Existence> No video links please Interior_gummy
<Wrek> 05<3
<prince-dari> Your world? I've been up till 8am the last 4 days. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6No. Video. Links. >>;
<Spectrum> hnnng
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't get to sleep. Like ever.
<Spectrum> Combustiblelemons, i'd have to say Rainbow Dash.
<SirReginald> but it was relevant to the joke. D:
<Aponymous> Now for mood whiplash, TIME FOR RE-ANIMATOR!
<Ziltoid> TIME FOR BEST MOVIE
<Ivan> In the way that you scare the children into intimidating you.
<AngryJohn9000> pottsi: i think they stopped because they saw you
<EmmettBrown> Where the moon goes.
<Combustiblelemons> i saw that coming.
<Trooper7psp> oh god, not that again
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Moon_phases_en.jpg
<Ivan> Fluttershy is so evil
<AngryJohn9000> i can show you some logs, pm me if interested
<AllisZero> Shut your whore mouth
<Nittany_Tiger> Not enough Rainbow Dash this week.
<pottsi> the ops can ban them?
<DecapKing> Fluttershy has Terrifying Presence
<Combustiblelemons> agreed
<herospirit> Oh no....
<AngryJohn9000> pottsi: the ops are the ones that spammed
<herospirit> NOT THIS AGAIN
<Spectrum> oh....my.....
<SirSprinkles> 6But even if it's not LotR, it needs to be something BIG.
<Luna> 07lol @ herospirit
<scatr> rainbow dash and applejack and pinkie pie were too busy being shipped with one another this week
<AngryJohn9000> overmind88, amigo
<ThePretender> ...what
<SirReginald> Fuuuuu
<Ziltoid> umad herospirit?
<Trooper7psp> uhhhhhh
<ThePretender> s going o?
<Spectrum> I'M GONNA STAY AND WATCH THIS AGAIN!
<Trooper7psp> oh jeez
<Ivan> So does Pinkie Pie, but she barely uses it. Have you seen her Rawrr? Terrifying.
<RobotPinkie> Hello boys and girls... come a little closer
<Spectrum> GOD
<ValtheJean> we could do Band of Brothers <.< >.>
<SirSprinkles> 6Because we need to draw in a crowd for the stress test.
<Spectrum> THIS MOVIE IS SO HORRIBLE
<Spectrum> I'm the reanimator...
<EmmettBrown> I'm only here to give you guys moon trivia
<herospirit> I'm cool with the gore. The zombie rape, on the other hand...
<Ziltoid> Spectrum:this movie is amazing
<RainBroDash> 10I'm not sure how well we can draw in a crowd at EU times
<zuggman> i love this movie :D
<herospirit> OH SO MUCH ZOMBIE RAPE
<RainBroDash> 10on a weeknight
<SirReginald> It was good till that one part. We who were here last night know.
<Luna> 07and creepy...
<Spectrum> Ziltoid, IKR.
<ThePretender> wait, did I miss the A movie?
<scatr> what's it called agian?
<Trooper7psp> i gotta... uh... go and uh... clean the toaster...
<SirSprinkles> 6Doesn't have to be EU times... =/
<Spectrum> I was here last night.
<Silverscreen> BRB
<Zephirdd> yes ThePretender
<scatr> yeah, we just watched batman
<mib_12klvl> Oh snap I just watched this movie recently
<Zecora> german ?
<Spectrum> The reanimator.
*Octavia 14mutes
<SirSprinkles> 6It could be somewhere inbetween.
<mib_12klvl> The Reanimator right?
<mib_12klvl> Awesome
<Ziltoid> guys no spoilers
<scatr> thanks
<Spectrum> The reanimaor...is not batman.
<Dark_Horst> i like how english people try to sound german
<Kitsune> channel flooding is not spam, it is channel flooding. the ops of the channel can litterally do anyting that the channel owner will let them.
<RainBroDash> 10Fine with me, just you said EU times before so :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, 5 PM eastern instead of 7.
<Spectrum> this is very nonbat.
<AngryJohn9000> they were advertising another irc server
<Bjornfot> ooh, have the B movie started?
<mib_ftkbft> dear god
<Zephirdd> WTF
<EmmettBrown> Moon teim
<AngryJohn9000> with lots of lines
<EmmettBrown> After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft, notably by the final Soviet Lunokhod rover. Since 2004, Japan, China, India, the United States, and the European Space Agency have each sent lunar orbiters.
<Ziltoid> SPLODE
<herospirit> ER IST TOT
<Rezo> Dat German
<Spectrum> SUDDENLY, EYES EXPLODE EVERYWHERE.
<Bjornfot> LOL.
<AngryJohn9000> pottsi: also i remember some people saying that some troll clan is residing there under the mask of archlinux community
<Trooper7psp> "i love you"
<herospirit> That was probably the tamest part of the movie
<SirReginald> And thats how Equestria was made.
<SirSprinkles> 6My chat ad is for some MLP game.
<AngryJohn9000> not sure if it is true though
<RobotPinkie> Previously, on House M.D...
<ThePretender> looks like he...won't live to see tomorrow
<The_Si> Corny opening titles are corny.
<Ivan> LIFE ETERNAL!
<ThePretender> *glasses*
<Veewave> I might have to try sticking a glowstick in a corpse one of these days.

<mib_ftkbft> dat eye
<Bjornfot> poor you sirsprinkles... use adblock
<Rezo> wat
<SirSprinkles> 6Any ideas for something that'll be BIG?
<Ziltoid> this intro is my fetish
<herospirit> Dat picture
<Zephirdd> well, im out
<Zephirdd> good night/afternoon/morning guys
<Luna> 07hmm
<Zephirdd> =D
<Rezo> So I take it that this film has no ironoc or humorous value to speak of?
<SirReginald> Maybe his eyes did that because he watched this movie?
<ValtheJean> any sort of well known trilogy or series could work
<RobotPinkie> night Zephirdd
<SirSprinkles> 6We could do one of the other movie series we've got...
<Veewave> to see if it comes back to life.
<scatr> yeah amma go too, don't think i'll like this
<scatr> later guys
<Zephirdd> before I leave
<ValtheJean> like Star Wars for example
<Luna> 07pirates?
<Ziltoid> Zephirdd:YOU MUST STAY
<SirSprinkles> 6Star Wars.
<Octavia> 14I dunno, what do a lot of people really like? lol
<Tranquility> What is this?
<Luna> 07harry potter
<herospirit> Not on PUURPOSE, Rezo
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<SirSprinkles> 6HP is too long.
<herospirit> Purpose*
<EmmettBrown> The Moon is the only celestial body on which humans have landed. While the Soviet Union's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959, the United States' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date, beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned lunar landings be
<RobotPinkie> bai scatr
<Zephirdd> :D
<Ziltoid> Tranquility: Re-animator
<Zephirdd> byebye
<Silverscreen> HP is seven movies. NO.
<Luna> 07thanks for the hug :)
<SirSprinkles> 6Pirates is bleh.
<Octavia> 14Ouch
<Rezo> They should do a cthulhu hentai
<Luna> 07hmm
<Octavia> 14Pirates is good
<SirSprinkles> 6Without the last movie, that is.
<EmmettBrown> etween 1969 and 1972—the first being Apollo 11. These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks, which have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding of the Moon's origins
<ValtheJean> I'm all for Band of Brothers, but I'm not sure how many people know about it
<Aponymous> This movie is unintentionally funny, and more than a little creepy.
<Zecora> wat ?
<SirSprinkles> 6I mean, they're still working on the Pirates series.
*RobotPinkie hugs a random person
<RainBroDash> 10isn't band of brothers really long?
<SirSprinkles> 6They're making a fifth right now...
<SirSprinkles> 6BoB is incredibly long.
<Luna> 07true true
<EmmettBrown> Moon rocks make an awesome portal conductor
<SirReginald> My hug!
<SirSprinkles> 6I think best bet is Star Wars.
<pottsi> it loos like a relay bot
<EmmettBrown> You don't need them but it helps
<Ziltoid> Aponymous: everything in this movie is intentional
<ValtheJean> well, it's divided into hour-long episodes
*Bjornfot hugs RobotPinkie
<Kitsune> yet, it is amigo's channel
<MasterWarning> what movie
<Bjornfot> hi bro!
<MasterWarning> hi
<ValtheJean> and yeah, Star Wars is very recognizable
<Combustiblelemons> ground up moon rocks are also deadly poison too.
<RobotPinkie> hey Bjornfot :D
<Mazoot> That re-animator song stuck in my head.
<pottsi> it's causing no harm on this network
<ThePretender> also, there are zombies on the moon
<Octavia> 14Not a Star Wars fan, but it is very popular indeed
<Octavia> 14So it might work.
<Aponymous> Thinking about it, you're right Ziltoid.
<The_Si> Is the acting intentional?
<Combustiblelemons> M-m-m-moon zombies?
<RandomExtra> Well...I think I'll leave before this gets too gore-filled for my taste.
<Luna> 07^
<Wrek> 05it has my vote aswell
<RainBroDash> 10which star wars films?
<SirSprinkles> 6All six.
<Luna> 07reading my mind octa?
<ValtheJean> though dear god I hope we're talking about Eps IV-VI
<herospirit> No, it's just bad, The_Si :P
<ValtheJean> all six?
<The_Si> SHE IS EX-FATTY.
<Ivan> This movie is just silly
<ThePretender> yep, moon zombies
<Ivan> women as doctors
<Octavia> 14Always Luna ;)
<SirSprinkles> 6Starting with Ep IV, of course.
<RainBroDash> 10inb4 heavy elitism about the 4th to 6th being so much better
<RainBroDash> 10adnasfdadf
<SirSprinkles> 6Original trilogy, then prequel trilogy.
<Octavia> 14Lmao
<ValtheJean> well they are :P
<ThePretender> and elaborate moon bases
<Veewave> lol
<herospirit> The weak of stomach or sanity should leave
<RobotPinkie> >yfw this movie got almost universal acclaim
<Silverscreen> IV-VI
<herospirit> RobotPinie: Wat
<RobotPinkie> and with good reason, if you ask me :P
<Ziltoid> This movie made twice its budget when it came out
<SirReginald> Dat sweat
<Aponymous> RobotPinkie: That makes sense, this movie is awesome.
<The_Si> Universal? Did Mars love it?
<AngryJohn9000> pottsi: http://dpaste.org/1pk0c/
<AngryJohn9000> log from ~15 minutes ago
<Rezo> Blame the 'Based on Lovecraft' part.
<SirSprinkles> 6If we do Star Wars we have to do all of them or it'll seem lazy.
<herospirit> Mars was all over this shit
<Ivan> "Thank yuo stereotypical black security guard"
<RobotPinkie> Bruno Mars?
<Rezo> Though I never saw the appeal in Lovecraft's writing
<EmmettBrown> Trying to give you moon trivia,watch the movie,and trying to loosen to bolts on my meccano remote controlled car hurts
<ThePretender> Life on Mars?
<Silverscreen> point.
<RobotPinkie> Mars bars?
<Ziltoid> IT MOVED
<Wrek> 05agreed, i suggest in order aswell, might draw the few who havent seen them all
<Wrek> 05in order
<The_Si> Poke poke poke.
<Wrek> 05and gotten the whoel chain of events
<Ivan> Dumb gracity
<herospirit> This was considered a romantic comedy on Mars
<Ivan> *gravity
<pottsi> nothing wrong there
<RainBroDash> 10so wait, which order?
<pottsi> he owns the channel
<Wrek> 05(though might be obvious)
<herospirit> And assumed to be non fiction.
<SirReginald> Lazer
<ValtheJean> order of video release
<Nittany_Tiger> We need to go back to the moon and go to Mars.
<ThePretender> EWWWWWWWWWWWW
<pottsi> he's free to advertise what he wants
<SirSprinkles> 6I vote original trilogy then prequels afterwards.
<PrincePOLO> sweet
<Aponymous> Herbert West's Motivation: BECAUSE SCIENCE!
<RainBroDash> 10well order of video releases != chain of events
<ValtheJean> Empire Strikes Back is Shit if everyone is like "Well no fucking DUH Luke!'
<SirReginald> lol, forgot about THE SCIENCE
<PrincePOLO> for science, you monster

*ThePretender runs to EqD

<RainBroDash> 10the prequels get so much hate
<SirSprinkles> 6OUTTA NOWHERE
<RainBroDash> 10they're just films

<Aponymous> Night Mazoot
<Combustiblelemons> I can't wait for it to be released octavia :
<The_Si> Pussy'd
<Combustiblelemons> :P*
<SirReginald> inb4 best cut ever
<RainBroDash> 10people take shit way too seriously >.>
<ThePretender> oh hey porn
<prince-dari> New films are better anyway.
<Ivan> Needs more zombie
<Combustiblelemons> epic cut.
<Combustiblelemons> WTF
<Bjornfot> COCKBLOCK
<Aponymous> Suddenly, pants
<mib_12klvl> This isnt ponies
<Kitsune> ..and the world is big enough fr many (many) irc networks. even freenode ;)
<The_Si> We've seen tits, ass and pussy.
<ThePretender> cats are the worst cockblockers ever, speaking from personal experience
<prince-dari> What, no response at all?
<prince-dari> Aww.
<prince-dari> I am disappoint.
<RainBroDash> 10I get a bit annoyed watching older films to be honest, despite appreciating the old films when I first watched them, I can't re-watch them really
<ValtheJean> lol, it was just too obvious dari :P
<Rezo> ThePretender: truth
<Aponymous> The sexiest part hasn't even happened yet. :/
<ValtheJean> you need to refine your subtle trolling
<SirSprinkles> 6So... vote on showing them in order release?
<prince-dari> Subtlety is overrated.
<Combustiblelemons> that's why I don't have a cat ^_^
<Silverscreen> Original first.
<SirSprinkles> 6As in 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3.
<herospirit> Fuck, you need an Artix account to play?
<ValtheJean> aye
<Octavia> 14Combustiblelemons Its not Fighting is Magic I'm talking about, this is a different pony game :P
<Rezo> yay frontal nudity!
<Veewave> Sexy zombiebutt?
<SirSprinkles> 6I vote yes.
<Combustiblelemons> ohh ok
<prince-dari> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 makes more sense to me.
<ThePretender> my ex's cat hated me
<RainBroDash> 10well I think it makes more sense 123456
<Wrek> 05I too vote for 123456
<RobotPinkie> Zombiebutts are the best
<Combustiblelemons> animals like me
<prince-dari> Lol, herdmind RainBro.
<Combustiblelemons> especially dogs...
<SirSprinkles> 6People will shitstorm... >>;
<RainBroDash> 10lol
<PrincePOLO> Kill it! Kill it!
<The_Si> Damnit West, I was role-playing!
<RainBroDash> 10and sirsprinkles, why?
<mib_12klvl> DAAN STOOOP I DONT LIKE IT
<mib_12klvl> STOOOOP
<mib_12klvl> DAAAAAN
<SirReginald> O hay Mr. West
<Veewave> *falls down stairs*
<Wrek> 05becasue people are douchebags
<SirSprinkles> 6Because people rave over the originals?
<PrincePOLO> lol xD
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<RainBroDash> 10mfw that didn't answer my question ;_;
<RobotPinkie> Sex and cats don't mix
<herospirit> Octavia, is making an account worth it?
<SirSprinkles> 6People don't even like the remastered versions of the originals.
<ValtheJean> it's Star Wars, there's going to be nerd wars regardless of what we do
<RainBroDash> 10I mean, why would they be annoyed at the order?
<Nittany_Tiger> I missed the cat, didn't I?
<SirReginald> Herbert Moodkiller West
<Zecora> ponies and ponies and ponies ...
<Rezo> Yes
<SirSprinkles> 6So if we show them out of order release, they'll flip, because it kills suspense. In every way.
<RainBroDash> 10the order makes no indication of preference or anything
<ThePretender> Herbert West: Moment Killer
<RainBroDash> 10and also: implying suspense in star wars ACTUALLY exists anymore?
<herospirit> And rainbowy ponies and sunshiny ponies
<ValtheJean> you'd be surprised
<RobotPinkie> Depends on what you mean, Nittany_Tiger
<ValtheJean> Star Wars isn't aging as well as you'd think
<ValtheJean> some people only know about Clone Wars and whatnot
<Zecora> and clouds full of ponies
<herospirit> Rezo, was that "yes" at me?
<SirSprinkles> 6There are plenty of people that haven't seen all the Star Wars movies...
<ValtheJean> which makes me a sad pony
<SirSprinkles> 6Especially not in the order they were intended.
<prince-dari> Star Wars is only average anyway.
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is the order they were released.
<Silverscreen> 123456 makes more sense, but 456123 is more entertaining.
<Nittany_Tiger> Might spoil the movie if I elaborate.
<Veewave> This is the sexy part, right?
<RainBroDash> 10well the prequels don't -ruin- the story of the 456
<RobotPinkie> >yfw I fucking LOVE ponies.
<ValtheJean> yes they do rbd
<ValtheJean> like, they completely do
<RobotPinkie> I'm probably the only one, though...
<Rezo> No. For that tiger thing
<SirReginald> *drip*
<CrossBreeze> 12<prince-dari>: Star Wars is only average anyway
<Aponymous> This part is SO sexy.
<CrossBreeze> 12^heresy
<SirReginald> *drip*
<SirSprinkles> 6They do. They really do.
<ValtheJean> as I said, Empire Strikes back is completely ruined if you know Vader is his father
<Skag> What movie is this?
<ThePretender> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Veewave> IT SO IS!
<The_Si> TA DA
<Ziltoid> skag re-animator
<herospirit> MAGIC
<prince-dari> Well I'm not that bothered.
<SirSprinkles> 6Most of it is completely ruined.
<RobotPinkie> Then no, Nittany_Tiger
<ThePretender> IT GETS WORSE?
<RobotPinkie> You haven't
<prince-dari> Either way then.
<Skag> thanks
<herospirit> It gets SO MUCH WORSE
<RainBroDash> 10how could someone not be familiar with vader being his father, and want to watch a star wars marathon? O.o
<SirReginald> Suddenly, Skull
<SirSprinkles> 6-_-;
<Zecora> uuuuuuuu pretty
<ThePretender> EWEWEWEWEWEEWEWEWWW
<Aponymous> Wait 'till the end :P
<Ivan> Oh Dr, your so inhuman.
<ValtheJean> because they know star wars is popular but yet never took the time to watch it?
<mib_ftkbft> mmmmmmm
<herospirit> they shower nice feelings and hugs from THE SKY!
<Veewave> toupe
<The_Si> Neat.
<Bjornfot> BONESAW
<SirSprinkles> 6Because maybe they want to watch them because they haven't seen them all?
<Octavia> 14herospirit You mean for the Pony Vs Pony game? I'm not sure, I havent played it yet, but I'm thinking about trying it
<prince-dari> Everyone knows Vader is Luke's father.
<prince-dari> EVERYONE.
<RainBroDash> 10^
<Combustiblelemons> quick cutting
<prince-dari> Because "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
<The_Si> "Look, I'm Davey Crockett!"
<SirSprinkles> 6Doesn't matter.
<herospirit> So am I Octavia.
<ValtheJean> tell that to my older sister when I showed it to her a year ago...
<Aponymous> Herbert West: Science Troll
<Octavia> 14The music is silly and addicting like Nyan Cat too
<Rezo> y u so funny, lecturer?
<herospirit> And ponies and ponies and ponies and poonies....
<RainBroDash> 10valthejean is she a BMN viewer who spends her time in IRCs and on forums and imageboards? :P
<SirReginald> poonies?
<SirSprinkles> 6Showing them out of release order would be like showing LotR with Two Towers first.
<ValtheJean> no, she was a film major
<RainBroDash> 10my granny doesn't know the ending either
<herospirit> ponies.
<ThePretender> that guy is so rude
<SirReginald> :D
<Zecora> dat song
<RainBroDash> 10O_______________________O
<ThePretender> snapping his pencil as such
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not how they're intended to be watched, frankly.
<Aponymous> Problem, Doctor?
<RainBroDash> 10fair, do what you want :P
<The_Si> *snaps pen*
<ValtheJean> well, I think we should just vote it and let that be done with it
<SirReginald> snap
<Veewave> lol
<ValtheJean> we aren't going to change anyone's minds
<herospirit> (listens to Pony vs Pony song while watching Re-Animator)
<Ivan> that song, totally ruins the mood of this movie and its awesome.
<RainBroDash> 10well you guys seem much more adamant than I am
<Veewave> This guy is a dick!
<RainBroDash> 10so if that's the better choice go with it
<prince-dari> Yeah, I'm not bothered.
<RainBroDash> 10me neither really
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, vote. Prequels first or order of release.
<The_Si> A toast to SCIENCE.
<RainBroDash> 10I'm just giving my opinions
<herospirit> It looked like the doctor was singing about Ponies while staring angrily at West.
<Octavia> 14lol
<RainBroDash> 10well didn't we just say that a vote is kinda pointless?
<SirSprinkles> 6We did not.
<herospirit> ...Octavia. I'll sign up for it if you will. :I
<SirSprinkles> 6At any point.
<herospirit> not going into this alone, dawg.
<AngryJohn9000> lol, they banned me for complaining -.-
<DecapKing> what?
<RainBroDash> 10that's what I meant by saying I'm less adamant than you are, and dari saying he's not bothered
<RainBroDash> 10More like: any major objections to showing them 456123?
<Zecora> need that music
<Octavia> 14Not sure yet. XD
<RobotPinkie> Does it cost money, though?
<herospirit> :P
<herospirit> I don't think so.
<Octavia> 14Its free
<Aponymous> Creepy...
<DecapKing> whats free?
<Silverscreen> Lucas has stated that the series is meant to be watched in order of I-VI. But almost everyone who's a fan of star wars agrees that the absolute best way to watch them is to do the original trilogy first.
<ValtheJean> well if you guys honestly think it should be shown 123456 then vote that way, that's what votes are for :P
<Octavia> 14The Pony Vs Pony game
<Ziltoid> I WILL RAPE YOU
<herospirit> It's an account that lets you play all of the games on their website.
<RobotPinkie> I might try it, then.
<PrincePOLO> how long is that movie?
<SirReginald> eh
*Ziltoid signing up for pony vs pony game
<SirSprinkles> 6Lucas... is a turd. You saw what he did to Indiana Jones.
<Combustiblelemons> it'd better be.
<RainBroDash> 10Yeah but it might not be sensible to weight my honest opinion the same as one of yours, since you seem to be much more sure of yourselves
<herospirit> Okay, if Ziltoid is going in, so am I. :0
<The_Si> Westurbating.
<ValtheJean> >.<
<Wrek> 05I see the point, though i cant decide, do whatever I fold.
<Combustiblelemons> then again, the guys behind that game deserve some money
<herospirit> They'd better release this song
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/UN5cZ3 HOW LUNA ENDED UP ON THE MOON!
<Octavia> 14I dont care either way. XD
<Ivan> "Its just a lot of little things" "ponies!"
<ValtheJean> okay, I may have come across to blunt. If the vote says 123456 I'm fine with that, I was just saying my opinon on them
<Zecora> i would pay money for that song
<Rex_Ivan> poor kitty
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay, who thinks 123456, who thinks 456123?
<Wrek> 05aye
<mib_12klvl> pspspsppss
<Luna> 07doesnt matter to me
<Wrek> 05just to have something to go on, 123456
<Combustiblelemons> the cat is dead.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm saying 456123
<RainBroDash> 10well again. Don't weight my opinion the same as yours
<Ziltoid> Combustiblelemons:OMG HOW DID YOU KNOW?
<Combustiblelemons> west is a douche.
<RobotPinkie> Cats are tomatoes.
<herospirit> DAMN IT, someone is already using herospirit as a username
<RainBroDash> 10so I might aswell say I don't care, to even it out :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Attack of the Killer Catmatoes.
<Nittany_Tiger> And my cat's here.
<Wrek> 05jsut voted for personal preference
<DecapKing> im signed up for Pony vs Pony
<Nittany_Tiger> She's also black.
<RobotPinkie> what a bastard!
<SirSprinkles> 6>personal preference
<SirReginald> sbsbsbsbsbs = cat call
<Luna> 07come on people there's more to discuss
<SirSprinkles> 6>not thinking about attracting viewers to test the chat
<PrincePOLO> dat bg music
<Octavia> 14Indeed, what Luna said
<Wrek> 05>correct
<Octavia> 14Stop nerd raging with each other :P
<RobotPinkie> That's not how you call a cat!
<RainBroDash> 10there is no nerd raging >.>
<Veewave> Oh. My. God. That song.
<ThePretender> looks like that pussy *glasses pull* got fucked up
<Octavia> 14RAAAAGE
<ValtheJean> let's just move on, and put a poll on the forum shall we?
<Luna> 07So we see ^
<herospirit> Usin mah triple back up username
<The_Si> Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaah
<RainBroDash> 10valthejean, mfw that solves nothing :P
<SirSprinkles> 6We need to decide NOW, Val.
<ValtheJean> oiy
<SirSprinkles> 6No polls that'll only delay it.
<Luna> 07ok vote do eeet
<Luna> 07now
<Ivan> Guess that cat won't be blocking any cocks any time soon.#
<Luna> 071 minute *sets timer*
<RainBroDash> 10again, is anyone -opposed- to 456-123?
<Silverscreen> Original first.
<ValtheJean> well since no one else will vote, I'm for 456123
<SirSprinkles> 6 456123
<RainBroDash> 10instead of a vote
<Wrek> 05then its settled
<The_Si> Pussy killer.
<Luna> 07456123 it is?
<Wrek> 05lets continue
<Luna> 07done
<Rex_Ivan> it suffocated .. in my fridge
<Ziltoid> BLACKMAIL
<SirSprinkles> 6 456123 it is.
<SirSprinkles> 6Done.
<The_Si> JARATE.
<herospirit> Defenders of cupcakes and shooting star wishes, they shower nice feelings and love from the SKY!
<SirSprinkles> 6When do we do it, and how?
<Luna> 07so much discussion :D
<Combustiblelemons> so do you buy it?
<ValtheJean> that's what happens when you put people on the internet in a chatroom :P
<NightShade> glowstick juices
<Veewave> afk
<Silverscreen> From what we're all saying, It's suppose to be done before S2
<Ivan> "Your sleeping with ponies!"
<herospirit> Buy what?
<RainBroDash> 10idk, I don't know our demographic well enough to know what it being on a weekday will do
<SirSprinkles> 6Monday-Tuesday at 5 PM Eastern or Tuesday-Wednesday at same time?
<Combustiblelemons> buy that it suffocated
<SirSprinkles> 6This week it needs done.
<DecapKing> DID I HEAR JARATE!
<RainBroDash> 10doesn't it need to be 3 nights?
<Silverscreen> 11Monday is Labor Day in US.
<SirSprinkles> 6Indeed it is...
<Luna> 07Do we have everything ready?
<ValtheJean> we also need to figure out who can stream next week
<ThePretender> he isn't doing a good job of selling it, Combustiblelemons
<RainBroDash> 10what does that mean, is it a holiday?
<PrincePOLO> Somehow West reminds me of a serial killer
<Luna> 07infrastructure / technical that is?
<Kitsune> do your wall outlets need warning stickers about forks? (no offence, but we could see that ban comming..)
<ValtheJean> it basically means no one works
<herospirit> AND I AM IN
<Silverscreen> 11It's an odd holiday.
<ValtheJean> and no one has school
<Nittany_Tiger> That green stuff really doesn't bring people back to life. It just makes them glow in the dark.
<Ziltoid> is his falls down stairs
<herospirit> Time to make a pony
<Silverscreen> 11We Celebrate a day of labor by not going to work.
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is why I think Monday-Tuesday.
<Aponymous> THAT is how you barge into a room!
<The_Si> rofl
<mib_12klvl> ahaha
<RainBroDash> 10yeah we have the same, may day bank holiday
<pottsi> i bet kitsune a nickle that it was within 5 min
<pottsi> i won
<SirSprinkles> 6At 5 PM Eastern.
<pottsi> ty
<Luna> 07No house next week :)
<Octavia> 14lol Silverscreen
<Combustiblelemons> fail.
<ValtheJean> well if we're going to get through 6 movies we may need to start earlier
<Wrek> 05will have trouble attending, but i cant see any better options
<typjk> is it even possible to find that scary
<SirSprinkles> 6That's why it's at 5, Val.
<Ziltoid> MEOW
<SirSprinkles> 6Instead of 7.
<SirSprinkles> 6And no episodes.
<PrincePOLO> dat noise the cat does
<ThePretender> sounds more like a car engine than a cat
<RainBroDash> 10well all the EU/UK young'uns are going back to school this week
<Luna> 07^
<SirSprinkles> 6So it's 456 on Monday, 123 on Tuesday.
<RainBroDash> 10which means earlier to bed for them
<Luna> 07I lolled
<typjk> sounds like one of those RC cars
<The_Si> All film cats need this Meow SFX.
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, that's why 5.
<RainBroDash> 10 3 films per night?
<Nittany_Tiger> Beating up on a cat :< Someone call PETA!
<Aponymous> That's one strong cat.
<SirSprinkles> 6Any earlier and they won't be back from school.
<Rex_Ivan> it doesn't need to be scary when it's this cool
<Nittany_Tiger> Sounded like a RC plane to me.
<SirSprinkles> 6Splitting it differently would be weird.
<Combustiblelemons> epic cat
<The_Si> Problem, PETA?
<PrincePOLO> wut?
<Zecora> wow for a second i thought the cat was laughing
<Wrek> 05So it's 456 on Monday, 123 on Tuesday. <i agree
<ThePretender> same here
<PrincePOLO> trololo
<RainBroDash> 10I guess the minimum damage is that EU people can't watch part of 5 and/or all of 6
<ValtheJean> is anyone able to stream them?
<Silverscreen> 11Sounds good to me.
<Luna> 07Wrek can you make a poster?
<SirReginald> LOOOOL I TROLL U
<Ivan> "you should have seen the look on your face"
<Luna> 07banner and all that?
<Wrek> 05in less than a week?
<Luna> 07:D
<Wrek> 05ouch
<Rex_Ivan> Herbert West: tells bad jokes
<ValtheJean> lol, you could just get the original poster and shop Twilight's head onto it :P
<Ziltoid> Hertbert west tells best jokes
<SirSprinkles> 6In a little over a day. I'm not asking Wrek for a poster.
<GamerGodJones> So todays stream is for the European bronies right? am i still allowed here?
<Luna> 07okay no poster
<ValtheJean> 2,14 anyone is welcome
<Ziltoid> NO
<Silverscreen> 11It'd be really short notice.
<SirReginald> Dismisses 6-12 minute barrier to doctor's face. Then uses it to explain new theory.
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe.
<Octavia> 14Shopping pony heads on the original would be funny :P
<Wrek> 05though i could easelly throw together a "PONT WARS"
<Luna> 07http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-pony-wars.jpg
<Ziltoid> but yet everypony is welcome
<RainBroDash> 10are they around 1.5 hours each?
<Luna> 07my bf's wallpaper
<Ziltoid> yes*
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-a-true-brony.jpg
<ThePretender> Mountain Dew revives the dead?
<The_Si> JARATE.
<herospirit> Me and Lord Mango Moonbeam are off to beat the EVERLOVING SHIT out of other Ponies
<Aponymous> I don't know, he could still be alive
<Octavia> 14Didnt come up for me Luna :(
<ValtheJean> I think they're more around 2...but I'd need to check
<typjk> it glows so it has to work
<Luna> 07clickkkk
<ValtheJean> also I think that could work
<RainBroDash> 10well at 1.5 hours each we're talking 2:30am finish time my time :P
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<Silverscreen> 11We'll have ONE DAY to get the news out to people.
<Wrek> 05but yeah a siiiiimple text banner
<Ivan> Nuclear waste, always works.
<Zecora> oh god
<Wrek> 05if really needed
*DecapKing hugs Luna
<Silverscreen> 11I don't think we should do an entire starwars thing with so little promotion.
<Zecora> that will give me nightmares
<Rex_Ivan> why the hell didn't he strap it down first?
<Octavia> 14I mean the pic disappeared Luna :P
<ValtheJean> ideally anything we do would be NEXT week, but seeing as how the stress test has to be done this week there's no way around it
<Luna> 07Octa get mirc :P
<SirReginald> O hai
<ThePretender> Alan Halsey? Related to Catherine Halsey? HMMMM
<Octavia> 14Ugh XD
<Nittany_Tiger> Not going to live much longer.
<Octavia> 14I have it, but I like to use Mibbit more :P
<Silverscreen> 11I mean at least with LotR we had the poster up on the site for a week.
<PrincePOLO> man i gotta play pn y vs pn y music while moments like that
<Luna> 07fair point
<prince-dari> >like mibbit more than proper client
<prince-dari> >:(
<SirSprinkles> 6We could do it next weekend, and push the movies that were picked back a week...
<Luna> 07wat!

<RainBroDash> 10google tt0274518
<GamerGodJones> I havent seen the queen on mars yet :/
<Aponymous> SCIENCE requires shoes.
<RobotPinkie> Aw, Adventure Quest really wasn't all that good :(
<Ivan> no.... but still
<EmmettBrown> The bodysnatchers
<Ivan> and its Britain, not England.
<GamerGodJones> Same thing to most americans honestly :D
<prince-dari> MFW the first link that game up is one I've already visited.
<prince-dari> Lawl.

<Octavia> 14:P
<Octavia> 14And everypony came...
<Octavia> 14But anyway...
<RainBroDash> 10hehe
<GamerGodJones> Like when people say "America" they usually mean North America
<Ivan> Which is very odd, considering they know about Scotland, Ireland and I assume Wales.
<Ivan> I call it the US :P
<Octavia> 14Hmm, random movie for labor day...
<Wrek> 05Silverscreen brigns up an interesting idea, thoguh i dbout it would drag enough people to actually suffice as a test
<PrincePOLO> Well I bet Poland will be albe to send people in space *inb4 Poland cannot inyo spcace*
<PrincePOLO> into
<Octavia> 14Nah
<SirReginald> yes i think u
<GamerGodJones> I call it AHMURIKA, TBH
<The_Si> Poland cannot into spcace.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm just saying, why waste a big event like Star Wars on a simple stress test?
<SirSprinkles> 6True...
<Octavia> 14And we have to do it soon, so we can only do so much promotion at this point in any way unfortunately. We should have gotten this together sooner. lol
<Combustiblelemons> glowstick juice revives people?
<SirReginald> Yep
<ValtheJean> unfortunately we're just really crunched for time
<SirSprinkles> 6Wait!
<FreezeFrame> Actually, Poland has some real smart cookies
<Silverscreen> 11I say we go with the Streaming Season 1 idea.
<SirSprinkles> 6TITANIC!
<ThePretender> I call it Mountain Dew
*ValtheJean pukes
<Luna> 07omg!
<GamerGodJones> It has a rave party in their mind
<PrincePOLO> ok time for Pony vs Pony music
*Silverscreen 11punches Sirsprinkles.

<Ziltoid> MOUNTAIN DEW WAS THE ANSWER ALL ALONG
<prince-dari> I have never seen that film.
<Wrek> 05"stress test night at BMN, "instsert awesome movie"
<Octavia> 14Luna seems to like it... :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I suppose we could go with Season 1 if we do it all day Monday...
<Luna> 07:D
<prince-dari> I intend to continue that way.
<Silverscreen> 11I will never watch Titanic.
<prince-dari> FOREVER.
<Octavia> 14Thats basically the ida Wrek :P
<GamerGodJones> ITs obviously liquid Soylent Green
<Silverscreen> 11Season 1 All day Monday
<RainBroDash> 10hahahaa dari
<ValtheJean> if only those Fighting with Magic people had used us for their stream...
<prince-dari> Hah.
<EmmettBrown> More moon facts
<prince-dari> That'd have worked.
<ThePretender> what's more X-TREME than reviving the dead?
<SirSprinkles> 6Whatever happened with them?
<Octavia> 14:P
<ValtheJean> I have no diea
<GamerGodJones> Rainbow Dash
<ValtheJean> idea*
<RainBroDash> 10brb need a drink

<EmmettBrown> The newly formed Moon would also have had its own lunar magma ocean; estimates for its depth range from about 500 km to the entire radius of the Moon
<SirSprinkles> 6Did they do a release yet?
<Silverscreen> 11I'll send a message to Sethisto, post on Facebook and on Daily /oat/ as well as Steam and whatever else we got.
<Octavia> 14Didnt they just kinda forget about us?

<SirReginald> lol
<ValtheJean> perhaps the distance thing is good for us then :P
<prince-dari> Well, I don't have anything to contribute to the current discussion.
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright. So, Season One on Monday?
<GamerGodJones> This movie is about reanimating people... SOrry about the ultra spoiler there
<SirSprinkles> 6We need to get serious here, guys.
<Octavia> 14Marathon, loooooong...
<ValtheJean> if brony show is doing it, I don't think it's a good idea
<Rex_Ivan> oh, he's so getting expelled for this
<Aponymous> Herbert West achieves boss status.
<ThePretender> SO MUCH BLOOOD
<Combustiblelemons> X_X
<Octavia> 14Are they?
<RainBroDash> 10well I don't really know what to say
<ValtheJean> because the idea is for a stress test
<typjk> its super effextive
<SirSprinkles> 6Is Brony Show doing it?
<Combustiblelemons> damn that is gory
<Nittany_Tiger> Necrophilia!
<Zecora> buisness as usual
<SirReginald> Herbert West, Master SCIENTIST
<Bjornfot> >mfw i'm playing pony vs pony while watching this
<Octavia> 14Id theyre doing it, then I guess that ideas out.
<Octavia> 14No sense in having two of the same thing.
<Purple`Prose> BONE SAWING, LIKE A BAWSS
<Octavia> 14*if
<Octavia> 14Dat corpse raep
<SirReginald> The medic has nothing on Herbert West
<ThePretender> after RDR ad this movie, I will never trust people named Herbert again
<Rex_Ivan> IMPROVISE!
<GamerGodJones> RDR's ending made me cry
<FreezeFrame> RDR?
<Combustiblelemons> RDR?
<GamerGodJones> Red Dead Redemption
<ThePretender> Red Dead Redemption
<FreezeFrame> Ah
<Combustiblelemons> oh
<SirReginald> Daaan
<Silverscreen> 11We could do a restream of Superman IV.
<FreezeFrame> You screwed it up. :P
<RainBroDash> 10deathstalker marathon XD
<ValtheJean> lol
<The_Si> WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
<Silverscreen> 11And go the rest of the day on requests.
<Nittany_Tiger> Glow juice go!
<Zecora> here we go again
<Nittany_Tiger> Ooh, I'm going to start that game. Don't spoil it for me!
<SirSprinkles> 6We could do the mod movie picks... =/
<Luna> 07oh yes :)
<ThePretender> man, I just realize I missed an oppoortunity to say curiousity killed the cat
<SirReginald> lol
<Wrek> 05mod movie picsk eh?
<ValtheJean> as much as I would nerdgasm at the idea, I'm not sure if that'll draw in many viewers
<Silverscreen> 11Val: Which idea? Mod Movie Picks or Superman Restream?
<Octavia> 14Yeah, not sure if that would draw the large number we need either.
<Rex_Ivan> high five to ThePretender
<ValtheJean> either
<GamerGodJones> @Nittany_Tiger, the game is amazing, also i dont remember much to spoil it
<SirReginald> but glowstick juice brought him back
<Silverscreen> 11hmm...
<Octavia> 14I was thinking on the mod pics.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ok.
<Octavia> 14*picks
<ThePretender> high five back to Rex_Ivan
<Riders> ThePretender = In doing so, you missed an opportunity to receive one of my slaps for a lame joke
<RainBroDash> 10what kind of numbers are we looking for?
<Octavia> 14We just simply need something very popular and big
<ValtheJean> lol, if we had more time to organize it, we could have done something like "Mods fight to the death in X game"
<Aponymous> "YOU FUCKERS KILLED ME!"
*Denied_Existence slaps dashite.
*Dashite slaps Denied_Existence around with a bit of a large trout!
<Rex_Ivan> that guard's been gone a long while
<RainBroDash> 10we're probably best of just stress testing the next bmn
<Octavia> 14lol Val
<Luna> 07nope we need something real / something new / something many bronies like.. or we could just call it a stresstest.. and let everypony tune in.. see what we get and have them spread the word
<Luna> 07I mean S2 is a hot topic
<The_Si> Nothing happened. Except the blood.
<ThePretender> sorry if I speaks in puns XD
<ValtheJean> LUNA, YOU'RE BRILLIANT]
<ValtheJean> okay, roll with me on this
<SirReginald> Nice timing rex
<ValtheJean> Sumica's stream has been worked out, yes?
<Silverscreen> 11..
<ValtheJean> we advertise a global "Hey look at our streaming the Hub Quality"
<RainBroDash> 10hmm
<ValtheJean> we stream the Hub all of Monday
<The_Si> Best day ever.
<ValtheJean> and let people see how kickass our S2 stream will be
<Silverscreen> 11we could say we got a leaked version of S2 and show gen3.5
<Purple`Prose> Herbert West: Like a boss
<RainBroDash> 10just no.
<Octavia> 14Lmao
<Luna> 07hahahaha
<RainBroDash> 10:P
<Luna> 07troll
<prince-dari> ^ I hope that's a joke
<prince-dari> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Doesn't even have to be HUB... could be anything live.
<ValtheJean> lol, that'd give us a stress test for about .04 seconds :P
<prince-dari> Otherwise no one would ever trust us again.
<prince-dari> XD
<ValtheJean> well, if it's the Hub it's better, because it proves we have S2
<Ivan> Where was Herbet when Rainbow Dash needed to do a Sonic Rainboom?
<Purple`Prose> annnd lose 1d10 San
<SirReginald> Herbert West: Professional Comforter
<Ivan> haha
<RainBroDash> 10it can be HUB and/or just random TB
<RainBroDash> 10TV*
<Silverscreen> 11SECRET BUTT FUN!
<Octavia> 14:P
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, we'll show some HUB... but I'm sure nobody will want to watch all HUB.
<RainBroDash> 10since we can just change channels
<SirSprinkles> 6Exactly, RainBro.
<Wrek> 05hmm
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm sure people would like to see Regular Show if it's on...
<Rex_Ivan> He said that so casually
<ThePretender> "so, I'm going to open up your dad's brain..."
<ValtheJean> but I'm sure lots of people would be interested to see if we can ACTUALLY stream the Hub (or various TV in this case)
<Luna> 07but looking at ponychan people wonder how the quality of the stream will be
<ThePretender> nice bedside manner, doc
<SirSprinkles> 6That's the point, Val.
<MasterWarning> lol
<SirReginald> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6We can show SOME HUB, but we'll be showing everything live TV.
<Combustiblelemons> creepy doctor
<ValtheJean> with that being said, we'll need to let our S2 streamers know
<Wrek> 05so some hub streaming
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll be a test of both the chat and our TV streaming.
<ValtheJean> as well as advertise the HELL out of this
<Zecora> wow that doctor is creepy
<ThePretender> ...and now bedside manner takes on a new meaning
<Aponymous> "HI THERE!"
<Wrek> 05sprinkled (lol) with movies?
<Rex_Ivan> geez he really was going to tell her every creepy detail
<Luna> 07yes but there's much more in the agenda
<Luna> 07we need to speed up a little
<The_Si> "No respect, no respect at all!"
<SirSprinkles> 6No movies. All stuff straight of TV.
<Wrek> 05okie
<Rex_Ivan> CREEPYDOC!
<SirReginald> O HAI GUIZE! I"M A ZOMBIE
<RainBroDash> 10if we're doing this people will want to be told in advance
<Wrek> 05always wanted to see what american TV is like
<SirSprinkles> 6So when are we doing this?
<Octavia> 14Also need to make sure our live streamers are available of course
<Rex_Ivan> CREEPYDAD!
<SirSprinkles> 6Thursday?
<Aponymous> Holy crap, he does sorta look like Dangerfield...
<SirSprinkles> 6To get the word out?
<RainBroDash> 10I guess
<ThePretender> I CAN NOW NEVER UNSEE
<Luna> 07we first need to make sure our livestreamers are informed
<Combustiblelemons> so you're not going to clean his blood?
<ValtheJean> should we get on skype and see if any of our streamers are online?
<Silverscreen> 11Wednesday.
<FreezeFrame> Reeeespeeeeect
<SirSprinkles> 6Well maybe if they ATTENDED THE MEETING.
<Silverscreen> 11Gives a day for people to spread the word.

<Ziltoid> Yes.....
<Combustiblelemons> SERIOUSLY.
<Luna> 07ok
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, would you be able to set it up on the chat server so that only rooms approved by server admins can be created?
<herospirit> This movie is about to get A LOT weirder
<ThePretender> oh god, Herbert West = Medic from TF2
<herospirit> just so you know
<Aponymous> He was trying to steal his SCIENCE.
<SirReginald> Now doctor, nows not the time to be...losing your head.

<The_Si> "Kill me"
<The_Si> "Later"
<Dark_Horst> i can't rmember which was the last movie that made me laugh so hqard xD
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<Nittany_Tiger> Then Herbert does something really dumb.
<Dark_Horst> this is awesome
<prince-dari> Not sure, most likely no, I might be able to set it up so that only the rooms we originally set up on the server can exist.
<Combustiblelemons> ASSSSSS
<nyeh> sssssssssss
<prince-dari> I wouldn't want to do that.
<Nittany_Tiger> My hand is a dolphin!
<prince-dari> Though.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not a big deal then.
<Ziltoid> You
<Zecora> well i feel fine
<The_Si> WEEESSSSSSSSSSSST /Flapjack
<Dark_Horst> have no lungs? speak anyways
<Rex_Ivan> he STILL hasn't learned to strap them down?
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Elky> wtf am I watching

<Ziltoid> eeyup
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, so side projects...

<Elky> also, how far in the movie are we?
<SirSprinkles> 6First off, gotta find out what's going on with the Fighting is Magic team.
<Ziltoid> bout halfway
<Zecora> THE HEADLESS HORSE
<Ivan> ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies
<Aponymous> We're around the end.
<Rex_Ivan> How the hell do you think he feels?
<The_Si> Revive body of guy I decapitated. GENIUS.
<SirSprinkles> 6Who was it that originally contacted them?
<Combustiblelemons> how can he inhale without lungs?
<Elky> I hope, we're at the good part
<GamerGodJones> So im playing that pony vs pony game
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<Dark_Horst> SCIENCE
<GamerGodJones> Damn thats easy
<Dark_Horst> THAT'S HOW
<ValtheJean> apologies for the newbness, but what exactly did we have planned? did we offer to stream for them or something?
<Aponymous> Yes, this is getting to the good part :P
<prince-dari> I don't think we contacted them to start with.
<prince-dari> One of their members, or a couple were in the chat.
<prince-dari> So we started talking.
<MasterWarning> shes dead
<Combustiblelemons> oh god
<mib_x59myd> injecting mountain dew revives decapitated heads, I guess
<ThePretender> I said that already ;_;
<SirSprinkles> 6We contacted them to start with.
<SirSprinkles> 6And they all came to the chat.
<Silverscreen> 11I was the first to contact the Fighting is Magic Team.
<SirSprinkles> 6Silver, could you re-contact them at some point, just to ask how things are going?
<Silverscreen> 11Basically they said that they'd occasionally update us and eventually give us a date for the release.
<SirSprinkles> 6>occasionally update
<ThePretender> looks like he...lost his head
<Silverscreen> 11I can do that.
<SirSprinkles> 6>haven't herd from them
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright.
<Dark_Horst> badum tsss
<Rex_Ivan> YEEEEAAAAAAHH!
<ThePretender> man, I am on a roll today
<SirSprinkles> 6So... commissioning Mad Max for our mane banner.
<SirReginald> My SCIENCE
<Zecora> du dun dun
<Ziltoid> HAAHHAHAHAHHAHA
<ThePretender> bwaahahhaahahaha
<zuggman> creepy laugh
<Octavia> 14Is there time now though for that? She probably has quite the queue.
<Zecora> oh god it's hillarious
<Combustiblelemons> ... seriously?
<SirSprinkles> 6It doesn't need to be immediate.
*Purple`Prose is cheerfully pwning ponies on Pony versus Pony
<RainBroDash> 10sirsprinkles the game isn't coming out till well after s2 ends
<FreezeFrame> Oh no.
<ThePretender> body carrying a head is CLASSIC
<Octavia> 14Well, if we dont need it before S2, then...
<Wrek> 05what cotavia said
<SirSprinkles> 6RainBro, a little late to the party.
<typjk> the music makes this hilarious
<nyeh> derp
<Zecora> stupid body
<RainBroDash> 10just saying >.>
<ponywithafez> is it just me or is the head snoring
<SirSprinkles> 6And Octy, I'm just bringing it up so that everypony knows what's going on.
<Octavia> 14But if we dont need the banner before S2 starts, then I saw we try and get her to make one for us. Would be awesome.
<SirReginald> yep
<SirSprinkles> 6We need to discuss everything that's just been floating about.
<Zecora> bloodgasm
<Luna> 07exactly
<Combustiblelemons> AWWW YEAAAHHH
<Silverscreen> 11I'm just going to throw this out there now, I have absolutely no idea what any of you are thinking that the .net site is suppose to look like, so I have no idea how I can help with that.
<SirSprinkles> 6And yes, we don't NEED a new banner before S2.
<ValtheJean> I'm unfamiliar with Mad Max's work, could I get a link?
<Octavia> 14Also, great publicity to be done by her
<ThePretender> he's taking a...bloodbath
<The_Si> This is why JD's headless Doctor fantasy would never work.
<mib_ftkbft> ho HO!
<SirReginald> doh ho ho
<EmmettBrown> More moon trivia
<SirSprinkles> 6Silver, it'll look like a revamp'd version of the .co.cc site.
<Rex_Ivan> geez, just get the stapler and fix yerself
<Elky> >mfw Pony vs Pony
<EmmettBrown> The moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius of 240 kilometers and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 kilometers. Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 kilometers.
<RainBroDash> 10EmmettBrown so much moon trivia
<Elky> >mfw 'Ponies and Ponies and Ponies and Ponies and...'
<Ziltoid> suddenly mind control
<SirReginald> The more you know.
<Silverscreen> 11The .co.cc site is based on a horizontal layout, though. We're talking about having vertical banners and stuff.
<Zecora> O.o
<Purple`Prose> Wandering Blue King is currently Level 4
<typjk> it's twoface
<EmmettBrown> Also
<Combustiblelemons> half face!
<Elky> seems legit
<The_Si> Metal Gear Scrubs.
<Luna> 07imho the entire site needs a new look & feel
<RobotPinkie> The moon is not actually made of cheese.
<RainBroDash> 10vertical banners?
<Luna> 07including the news letter
<Ziltoid> Break time.
<SirReginald> No, THIS seems legit.
<EmmettBrown> The Moon is the second densest satellite in the Solar System after Io. However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 km or less; this is only ~20% the size of the Moon, in contrast to the ~50% of most other terrestrial bodies.
<RainBroDash> 10any fears about the window getting too wide?
<Octavia> 14Well, the banners Wrek is doing are vertical, yes.
<Ziltoid> >20%
<Rex_Ivan> Best guard in the world
<Octavia> 14Theyre going to be re-sized to all fit on it properly.
<The_Si> Full of headdy goodness.
<RainBroDash> 10ah ok. But I assume they won't be used on the theatre page much then?
<Rex_Ivan> Wait ... where was he going?
<RainBroDash> 10because everything on that is landscape really
<SirSprinkles> 6Not on the individual pages, no.
<SirReginald> Take a break
<Dark_Horst> how in the hell can you be out of breath, YOU'VE GOT NO FUCKING LUNGS!
<Dark_Horst> oh right
<Dark_Horst> science
<SirSprinkles> 6There will be a mane theater page that redirects to the individual theaters.
<herospirit> Ponies and Ponies and Ponies and Ponies
<Ziltoid> Science.
<SirSprinkles> 6And that will have the banners.
<DrFumbles> this is so funny
<RainBroDash> 10oh I see
<RobotPinkie> damn you, herospirit, you got me playing pony vs pony now :(
<RainBroDash> 10brbrbrbrbrbrbrb a drink and some crackers
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Ziltoid> pony vs pony is cool
<Luna> 07GG just logged on
<Ziltoid> and ponies are cool
<EmmettBrown> The other major geologic process that has affected the Moon's surface is impact cratering,[45] with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface. There are estimated to be roughly 300,000 craters wider than 1 km on the Moon's near side alone. Some of these are named for scholars, scientists, artists and explorers.
<prince-dari> So...Are we getting a domain then?
<SirSprinkles> 6We are.
<prince-dari> We really need to sort that. Sort of...Now.
<EmmettBrown> Ignore that 45,it never existed
<SirSprinkles> 6We just discussed it...
<Aponymous> MOONSPEAK!
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, already.
<prince-dari> Yeah, but we didn't DO anything.
<SirSprinkles> 6We're getting a .net domain.
<ThePretender> dohohoho
<typjk> herbert west crater
<Combustiblelemons> Wiki copy pasta
<prince-dari> We didn't discuss paying for it.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a dollar a year. -_-;
<prince-dari> Who we're buying from
<Elky> what should I expect from Pony vs. Pony?
<Aponymous> Zombie dad is PISSED!
<Luna> 07not a dollar :o
<SirSprinkles> 6From 1 and 1.
<prince-dari> Well if it's just so simple, do it now.
<ThePretender> that's one overprotective papa
<Silverscreen> 11Here's the problem I have, and I stated this in the forums: Having a separate page for each individual room makes a SHITLOAD of pages, considering the large list that Sprinkles set.
<SirSprinkles> 6Whatever stupidly low amount.
<EmmettBrown> Maybe I'll post trivia about objects in space more often
<MasterWarning> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6And, Silver?
<Zecora> the door u idiot
<Ziltoid> pony vs pony is a gem matching game
<Ziltoid> sort of
<Silverscreen> 11yes?
<Combustiblelemons> Hell
<Elky> huh?
<prince-dari> Anyway, having a separate page for each room would be a bit of a fail.
<SirSprinkles> 6What's the problem with that, exactly.
<EmmettBrown> Space core will never see all of space because it is stuck in orbit around the moon
<Ziltoid> INB4 terrible things happen
<prince-dari> Because people would just save that link and go straight to that, bypassing the traffic lights.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, I plan on making the pages themed per room.
<prince-dari> Rendering them useless anyway.
<Combustiblelemons> RAPE
<nyeh> rape
<Bjornfot> :I
<mib_ftkbft> RAPE
<Elky> I saw that it was made by the adventure quest guys...
<Bjornfot> I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING
<mib_ftkbft> boobies?
<ThePretender> >:|
<MasterWarning> zombie rape
<Combustiblelemons> God why.
<mib_ftkbft> i approve
<SirSprinkles> 6Then they wouldn't be able to join if it's full.
<EmmettBrown> Rap?
<Aponymous> Here's the good part :P
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not a big deal.
<mib_ftkbft> whoa
<ThePretender> DO NOT WANT
<Elky> DS2 had better fanservice
<Zecora> omg the look on his face
<prince-dari> It still seems like a fail.
<prince-dari> To me.
<Bjornfot> Also, who's playing Pony vs Pony right now?
<RainBroDash> 10I think I get what dari means
<RobotPinkie> wow, it must be cold in that room....
<mib_ftkbft> wat pony vs pony?
<EmmettBrown> Heres some plastic rap
<prince-dari> Because the whole traffic lights system is pointless then, the users don't need it.
<ValtheJean> well, I'm not sure how/if we could, but ideally we could have everyone register accounts or whatnot, and then they manually connect to servers like they would any web-based mmo
<EmmettBrown> http://blog.fabmagazineonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Vita-Wrap-Plastic-Wrap-305m.jpg
<Zecora> just the song or the actual game ?
<GamerGodJones> IM playing pony vs pony
<RainBroDash> 10does the traffic lights system mean you don't choose what room you join?
<RobotPinkie> Well, I am, kinda, Bjornfot
<Ziltoid> MY FETISH
<mib_ftkbft> .....
<ValtheJean> and by servers I mean rooms
<SirSprinkles> 6>register accounts
<prince-dari> They can just go straight to the link and keep trying till they get in.
<GamerGodJones> Y so easy D:
<SirSprinkles> 6No.
<The_Si> ...!
<Nittany_Tiger> Clemson Tigers are winning as well!
<Combustiblelemons> *trollface*
<SirSprinkles> 6No, RainBro, they still can choose.
<mib_ftkbft> oh noes
<SirSprinkles> 6It just tells them when it's full.
<mib_ftkbft> she is up
<RainBroDash> 10oh I see
<mib_ftkbft> drug her
<GamerGodJones> Oh hey its the rape part
<zuggman> problem?
<The_Si> ENJOY.
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/5MGV7b
<Zecora> bedroom talk
<herospirit> Oh GOG
<prince-dari> Watch out.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Bjornfot> add me 5097-7EFE
<mib_ftkbft> whoa
<prince-dari> That scene agin in the film.
<PrincePOLO> Ok I'm back what I missed... OH FUCK
<prince-dari> again*
<nyeh> OOOOOH GOOOD WHYYYY
<RandomExtra> I come back from a break to this?:O
<RobotPinkie> continuity error, her nipples were really stiff just a second ago
<ThePretender> ....
<ValtheJean> lol I have it on paused
<Combustiblelemons> *half assed push*
<The_Si> xD
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Aponymous> So many puns for this part, can't decide which to use...
<RobotPinkie> lolololol
<Zecora> headrape
<ValtheJean> the stream that is....since the movie began
<mib_ftkbft> wow she isnt even rlly resisting
<ThePretender> I can't pun to this, it's...just not right
<mib_ftkbft> WHOA
<GamerGodJones> You could say she is getting head
<ValtheJean> not like...that particular scene
<mib_ftkbft> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Luna> 07can we please stay on topic?
<RainBroDash> 10lol
<mib_ftkbft> he ruined it
<RobotPinkie> It's just so hard to get a head in life
<PrincePOLO> Well that's actually... kinda funny?
<Aponymous> Mr West is in the building!
<Purple`Prose> HERR DOKTOR!
<The_Si> He's covered corpses you know.
<GamerGodJones> The names west, Herbert West
<Zecora> oh shit
<typjk> balloon animals!
<The_Si> Thriller...
<SirSprinkles> 6OH GAWD WHAT?
<PrincePOLO> KILL IT WITH FIRE!
<Purple`Prose> West is such a straight-up pump
<GamerGodJones> *James bond reference*
<RainBroDash> 10are we going to register the domain then?
<mib_ftkbft> DAMN
<ValtheJean> well, even if we don't want registering accounts and whatnot, we could just have a dialogue for when they choose their nick that shows what rooms are open and whatnot
<GamerGodJones> SO i herd u leik nekkid ded ppl
<ValtheJean> and they could manually select which room to go to? I dunno
<mib_ftkbft> SHOOT EM IN THE HEAD
<The_Si> It's close to miiiiiiiidniiiiiiiiight...
<Combustiblelemons> Zombie master
<RobotPinkie> Those zombies are very Dawn of the Dead...
<PrincePOLO> It's past midnight
<SirSprinkles> 6...that would be a massive pain and would require dari to finish making his chat system in two weeks time.
<The_Si> His own head is his evil cat.
<SirSprinkles> 6...lol nope.
<ValtheJean> okay- then what other options do we have?
<ThePretender> this is how Dead Island starts
<Zecora> unlimated powaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<GamerGodJones> No Mr. West, I expect you to DIE (Remember the laser scene from that one movie? yeah thats what im referenceing)
<SirSprinkles> 6The light system is the best working system for the moment.
<RobotPinkie> you mean "this is how Equestria was made"?
<GamerGodJones> Close enough
<prince-dari> Automatic delegation makes things a hell of a lot easier/simpler.
<mib_ftkbft> zombie rage
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't think being a severed head forever would be fun.
<SirSprinkles> 6A LOT of people have problems with that idea, dari.
<Combustiblelemons> lolwut.
<GabeMoist> Best guard ever
<mib_ftkbft> cmon shoot em
<ThePretender> DAT GUARD
<Zecora> nothing unusual here
<mib_ftkbft> lol
<PrincePOLO> the guard: "Fuck. I'm this high?"
<ThePretender> go, rent a cop, goooo
<SirSprinkles> 6Many, many viewers have voiced their opinions on it.
<GamerGodJones> I JUST RELIZED SOMTHING GUISE!
<Aponymous> "What the fuck did I just walk into?"
<typjk> that bluer zombie is a navi
<Octavia> 14I can understand that.
<Combustiblelemons> guard: dayum I must be trippin' balls again
<The_Si> Best fight scene
<Ziltoid> SPLAT
<mib_ftkbft> oh damn
<SirReginald> Seems legit
<ValtheJean> okay- but we're kinda sticking ourselves between what we want and what we can do
<GamerGodJones> THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN WHERE THE BLACK GUY DOESNT DIE FIRST!
<GabeMoist> OVERDOOOOOOOOOOOOOSE!
<herospirit> OVERDOOOOSE
<Ziltoid> OVERDOSE
<mib_ftkbft> LOL
<GamerGodJones> OR AT ALL FOR THAT MATTER
<mib_ftkbft> oh shit
<SirSprinkles> 6Val... we're really not.
<mib_ftkbft> glow stick juice OD
<ThePretender> he just OD's on Mountain Dew!
<GabeMoist> Guard: NOPE
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a fairly easy setup and it's easily maintained. -_-;
<mib_ftkbft> RUN BLACK MAN
<PrincePOLO> lol?
<Zecora> dude what ?
<SirReginald> Oh he's going DUAL Syringe.
<ValtheJean> then what are we even discussing?
<Combustiblelemons> OH GOD WHAT
<GamerGodJones> Well thats, disgusting
<ThePretender> wat
<The_Si> Wat
<Aponymous> "It's the doctor! HE ODEED!"
<typjk> love how the guard watches for about a minute before reeacting
<Combustiblelemons> COCAINE TIME
<zuggman> that guy's got gutts
<mib_ftkbft> oh damn
<SirSprinkles> 6We were SUPPOSED to be discussing Mad Max.
<prince-dari> I think we should actually do something about the domain instead of just talking about it.
<The_Si> That black guard knows how this shit usually ends for a guy like him.
<ThePretender> no guts, no glory
<PrincePOLO> i'm not going to sleep this night at all
<mib_ftkbft> and then everyone died
<Nittany_Tiger> Attack of the Killer Colon.
<Ivan> Smokers got West!
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, I'll register it after the stream.
<mib_ftkbft> NOOO
<mib_ftkbft> oh shit
<The_Si> Shit shit shit!
<mib_ftkbft> NO NOT WEST
<zuggman> Herbert! Nooooooooooooooooo
<Combustiblelemons> CRAB BATTLE
<The_Si> Leave West to die. Worst L4D group ever.
<Purple`Prose> SAVE THE SCIENCE!
<SirReginald> My SCIENCE!
<Combustiblelemons> HUNTER!
<Aponymous> Ewww, I got brain on my hands!
<The_Si> Mounted by a naked zombie. Not his day.
<GabeMoist> THE SCIENCE FLEW OFF HIS FACE
<PrincePOLO> dat music
<mib_ftkbft> and he runs away
<mib_ftkbft> TO GET AX
<ThePretender> he's just been...disarmed
<Aponymous> I gotta axe you something!
<Nittany_Tiger> The zombie just wants an elevator ride.
<ValtheJean> okay, so about Mad Max. I'm assuming she has listed a price?
<Ziltoid> dat ass
<PrincePOLO> that reminds me of a crappy horror named Cabin Fever or somewhat
<Octavia> 14I love the idea of commissioning her for our main banner. I saw we get a price and get to da choppah!
<The_Si> Yep. Not his day.
<mib_xlodja> me gusta
<herospirit> FFFFFFFFFFFFF. Pony versus Pony; to get from lvl 3 to lvl 4, you need 27 exp. To get from lvl 4 to lvl 5, you need 640.
<The_Si> SHE IS EX-WOMAN.
<mib_ftkbft> crappy movie cabin fever was
<ThePretender> EVERYONE I KNOW IS DEEEEEEEEEEEEED
<herospirit> I ACCIDENTALLY THE EXP CURVE
<mib_ftkbft> MOAR BOOBIES
<Combustiblelemons> necrophilia time
<Octavia> 14Plus, since it'll be done by her, it'll obviously be great publicity.
<herospirit> Anyone else at level 4 yet? :0
<zuggman> here we go again :D
<PrincePOLO> Some mountain dew?
<Zecora> ideeeeeeeaaaaa
<ValtheJean> I'm not familiar with her work, but if she's well known then it can only help gain viewers
<GabeMoist> I SHALL REVIVE HER WITH THE SCIENCE!
*RainBroDash 10doesn't know who this is :P
<ValtheJean> ^
<Aponymous> Gave that bitch some SCIENCE, bitches love SCIENCE.
<typjk> worked so well the other times
<FreezeFrame> THAT'S OKAY! I DIDN'T WANT TO SLEEP ANYWAY!
<ThePretender> looks like he's going to do the dew
<MasterWarning> bad idea
<Octavia> 14She's one of the most well-known artists in the Brony community. :P
<Combustiblelemons> MOUNTAIN DEW TIME
<Zecora> best idea
<SirReginald> dat bg music
<ValtheJean> I'm sure I've probably seen stuff by her
<prince-dari> I thought she usually did comics or something.
<RainBroDash> 10oh I seee, what kind of art?
<Rex_Ivan> because it worked so well before
<Ziltoid> THE END
<ThePretender> ...what a non-ending
<Octavia> 14Pony stuff of course, but I believe she does other stuff... dont have a direct link to her dA atm...
<GabeMoist> AND THEY DIED
<MasterWarning> worst ending
<SirReginald> I'm doing this FOR SCIENCE
<Ziltoid> and then everypony came
<Aponymous> *Applauds this masterpiece*
<ValtheJean> I tried googling her but all I got was weird 80s films :P
<Combustiblelemons> There was once a smart scientist. He was so smart that everybody died. the end.
<Octavia> 14http://csimadmax.deviantart.com/
<Octavia> 14There we go.
<typjk> this movie: people die by zombies and get resurrected as zombies
<The_Si> Scream than dat music
<Rex_Ivan> clap clap clap
<The_Si> *then
<GamerGodJones> Took me goddamn forever to find this but:
<GamerGodJones> http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/116/f/9/my_little_reanimator_by_don_komandorr-d3ey1hy.jpg
<Ziltoid> clopclopclop*
<Rex_Ivan> clop clop clop
<SirReginald> slowclap.gif
<PrincePOLO> so looks like i came back for the very end of it... greatr
<The_Si> And then Megan was a zombie
<typjk> groobershy
<The_Si> OR WAS SHE
<GabeMoist> LOL
<Zecora> oh yes
<SirReginald> lol
<RainBroDash> 10oh I seeeee
<PrincePOLO> lawl
<DuskShine> Man, this movie.
<Zecora> all internets to you
<ThePretender> I laughed outloud
<Aponymous> GamerGodJones: I love that pic.
<ValtheJean> ah okay, I've seen some of her stuff
<Ziltoid> nice GamerGodJones
<PrincePOLO> need to save it
<GabeMoist> ALL MY INTERNETS
<RainBroDash> 10rofl gamergodjones. +9001 internet

<ValtheJean> I'mm all for the comission
<Ziltoid> fucken saved
<SirReginald> Saved
<GamerGodJones> Yay! so much love for me!
<Purple`Prose> Speaking of re-animator...
<Zecora> shut up and take my ponies
<GamerGodJones> And alot of internet evidentally
<Combustiblelemons> you get +42 internets from me GamerGodJones
<Purple`Prose> Can I request a post-movie music video? :3
<Rex_Ivan> wow, they got Pinkie's expression JUST right in that pic
<Octavia> 14Yeah, shes very good. And very nice.
<Nittany_Tiger> I've actually seen that pic twice before.
<Combustiblelemons> it's FOREVERRRRR face.
<Combustiblelemons> yeah i think it was on a EQD drawfriend
<ValtheJean> okay, so was there anything else we needed to discuss about her?
<The_Si> Melvin The Re-Animated
<Aponymous> I posted it around the beginning of the movie.
<GamerGodJones> Wait, did somebody write a fanfic involving ponies and reanimator?
<Rex_Ivan> but it looked pretty similar to the guy's head in a pan (at certain parts)
<Octavia> 14Well, not sure if anyone contacted her for a price yet.
<SirSprinkles> 6Somepony contacting her.
<Octavia> 14Supposed to do that.
<Rex_Ivan> if they didn't they need to
<Octavia> 14Do we know what we want in the banner yet?
<ThePretender> so what now?
<GabeMoist> What now?
<GamerGodJones> AND THEN THERE WAS TRAFFIC CONE
<herospirit> Now Ponies
<The_Si> Yeah, West, Dan & Megan were the worst L4D party ever.
<PrincePOLO> *raritywhatnow*
<Combustiblelemons> so, why didn't the father reanimate properly yet a man's head was fully functional?
<GabeMoist> Ponnyyyyy\
<interior_gummy> so where's the request chat room?
<ThePretender> THIS OSNG
<Combustiblelemons> YAY :D
<ThePretender> I LOOOOOVE EEEEEEEEET
<Zecora> classic
<SirReginald> oh man
<Combustiblelemons> *headnots*
<DuskShine> Love this PMV.
<Combustiblelemons> nods*
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly, I'd prefer for her to take any and all artistic liberty with it.
*ThePretender headbops
<herospirit> *head bob*
<Combustiblelemons> same
<Aponymous> Now, ENDLESS HEAD BOBBING!
*DuskShine headbobs.
<GamerGodJones> @combustiblelemons it makes sense tho, it takes less to reanimate a head
<Zecora> ^
<PrincePOLO> so fricken fed up with the song
<Octavia> 14Ah, so just tell her to have fun with it.
<The_Si> I guess West got the right amount of Dew with the head.
<Octavia> 14Thats cool.
<GabeMoist> Fluttershy looks like a duck
<Rex_Ivan> Combustiblelemons - because the dad died from brain damage trauma and the other guys brain was fully intact
<Octavia> 14Shes creative, I'm sure we can trust her to do something great.
<Combustiblelemons> ahh ok
<RainBroDash> 10well what are we going to say, if anything. and who/when? :P
<nyeh> PARTY HARD
<herospirit> POLO, I will never get fed up with this song
<PrincePOLO> Right... any guesses what happened to West?
<SirReginald> dat headnod
<Octavia> 14Someone with a dA account could contact her.
<Aponymous> WHY CAN'T I GET TIRED OF THIS SONG!?
<GamerGodJones> West survives in the sequels i heard
<Purple`Prose> He went to reanimate Cthulu?
<Zecora> cause ponies
<ThePretender> this video is gdlk
<Combustiblelemons> it's like rickroll- no matter how many times you hear it it doesn't get old
<FreezeFrame> It's awesome.
<SirSprinkles> 6Someone with a dA account that has stuff on it, preferably. XD
<RainBroDash> 10we have a BMN dA account
<Combustiblelemons> something very rare from music
<SirSprinkles> 6lol wut?
<Octavia> 14That works.
<mib_ftkbft> name of song>
<SirSprinkles> 6Since when?
<mib_ftkbft> ?
<ValtheJean> well, I guess I'm in the minority opinion on that one, I'd kinda think it'd be nice to at least have a vague idea of what we want. But I'll concede since there are other things to discuss
<Rex_Ivan> West escaped and went on to make more mistakes against nature
<GamerGodJones> What is love
<ThePretender> What is Love by Haddaway
<Combustiblelemons> what is love- the haddaway
<GamerGodJones> By haddaway
<herospirit> You seem alone in your opinion, princePOLO :p
<RainBroDash> 10since ages ago, everypony makes random decisions nowadays :L
<Aponymous> GamerGodJones: He does survive in the sequels
<RainBroDash> 10IIRC DCD made it?
<PrincePOLO> ehhh I guess so
<Octavia> 14I didnt know about it either. lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Clemson won.
<ValtheJean> yeah lol, that's new to me
<GamerGodJones> Was Beyond reanimator a musical?
<Combustiblelemons> Theres a sequel to that movie?
<GamerGodJones> Because all i know about that movie was the catchy ass song
<prince-dari> I knew we had one.
<Octavia> 14But we've kinda done that with two of three groups now on sites. Made them without everyone knowing. :P
<Aponymous> Several
<zuggman> 2 sequels, i thimk
<zuggman> *think
<interior_gummy> where's the link to the request chat?
<ThePretender> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS HEADBOPPERS YAAAAAAY
<GabeMoist> Charackters
<Combustiblelemons> were they any good or was it the same "sequels suck"
<Zecora> are the sequels good ?
<Nittany_Tiger> West survives the colon attack?
<Combustiblelemons> epic cheerilee
<GamerGodJones> Go look up beyond reanimator "Move your dead bones"
<The_Si> He beat the Smoker.
<ValtheJean> ung, I hate getting off topic but sprinks they're asking if you're taking requests. Should I link them the requests page or tell them you're not taking any?
<Luna> 07alright next item?
<Dashite> Hey Apokalipse!
<zuggman> imho, the sequels were ok
<Apokalipse> Hey
<herospirit> SON OF A BITCH, SNIPS
<Dashite> Tell Gravekeeper to get cracking on his next chapter! :p
<Nittany_Tiger> West used fiber!
<Apokalipse> I'm surprised someone noticed me
<Octavia> 14So yeah, just someone needs to contact her and get a price and we'll move from there.
<SirSprinkles> 6One moment.
<GamerGodJones> ITs ok
<GamerGodJones> I never get noticed
<Dashite> I recognize your name from GTP
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not taking requests right now guys, I will be in a bit though.
<Nittany_Tiger> I almost never get noticed myself :<
<Combustiblelemons> :fluttershyyay@
<ThePretender> Moskau?
<GamerGodJones> MOSKOW MOSKOW
<interior_gummy> k then
<Apokalipse> Wow. Sorry for having no idea, but who are you on there?
<FreezeFrame> MUST DO MOSKAU
<Combustiblelemons> no i've got one actually
<Dashite> I'm not on there. I lurk though.
<The_Si> lolerror

<GamerGodJones> kthc
<Apokalipse> Ooh
<GamerGodJones> kthx*
<GabeMoist> inb4business
<Aponymous> :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Alrighty, so somepony needs to contact Mad Max. Any volunteers?
<Combustiblelemons> Alex S. (feat. Ghost) - Melting Pot of Alcohol
<Combustiblelemons> do that.
<Combustiblelemons> pleeeease.
<Apokalipse> wow, you should make an account :D
<ThePretender> best disney song, imo
<RainBroDash> 10did some research
<PrincePOLO> ok I'm starting to be fed up with taht one too
<Aponymous> Another one I'll never get tired of.
<GamerGodJones> Oh this is just as good
<RainBroDash> 10DCD has some connections with mad max
<Dashite> I've been lurking off and on since BronyCray mentioned you guys
<interior_gummy> trixie=huns?
<Octavia> 14Do we just want to give her total free will over it or we have any guidelines at all?
<ValtheJean> I could do that if you'd like. Though I'd need to either make a DA page or get access to the one we own
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, will talk to DCD about it later.
<Apokalipse> hehe, yeah, there's a couple of writers on there
<Apokalipse> 3 or 4
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm guessing this from Mulan.
<Combustiblelemons> anyone else watching ghost getting trolled on radio graffiti?
<RainBroDash> 10>DCD's personal dA page >watchers >*CSImadmax
<ValtheJean> lol, nevermind then :P
<Aponymous> We need the Jackie Chan version later.
<Octavia> 14I think I remember him mentioning that now.
<Luna> 07we have a DA account + channel
<GamerGodJones> Jackie chan had this?
<RainBroDash> 10yep
<Zecora> the jackie chan version is awesome
<prince-dari> Well it has to be a suitable banner.
<ThePretender> and then the Bang Shishigami inspired one
<Ziltoid> jackie sang this chinese
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll have DCD do it, since he apparently knows Mad Max.
<Combustiblelemons> noone? okay :(
<Apokalipse> Bah, I need to be more active on there though
<FreezeFrame> Jackie Chan did both Cantonese and Mandarin versions
<prince-dari> We should have some basic guidelines.
<RainBroDash> 10we should also mention rough size / dimensions
<RainBroDash> 10and the text that goes on it
<Nittany_Tiger> That guy gets trolled all of the time.
<GamerGodJones> They had Gym in school in the oriental times?
<GabeMoist> yay
<FreezeFrame> He's an incredible singer (mostly because he was in an opera school at a young age).
<Octavia> 14Yeah, should say "BronyState" obviously
<Nittany_Tiger> Jackie Chan singing?
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe in his native language.
<Dashite> ^ Yup
<Zecora> i coudn't believe it till i saw it
<Aponymous> It is the best thing. Seriously.
<FreezeFrame> Yes, Nittany
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll be between 500x200 and 600x300 and say BronyState.
<Combustiblelemons> Disney movies I've never watched: mulan.
<GamerGodJones> Chan was born in america wasnt he?
<FreezeFrame> No
<SirSprinkles> 6Our current banner is 600x300
<Dashite> I saw one of his concerts on TV once.
<Nittany_Tiger> Is he singing this?
<ThePretender> nope
<GamerGodJones> Shows how much i know
<PrincePOLO> I'll check his singing... later
<ThePretender> also, no
<GamerGodJones> Disney movies ive never watched: most of them
<FreezeFrame> My roommate has a bunch of Chan's CDs
<RainBroDash> 10should we migrate away from the whole 'movie theatre' theme?
<Dashite> He isn't, but there are versions on youtube that have him singing.
<FreezeFrame> He actually released a whole bunch of albums in China
<RainBroDash> 10BMN has been our main attraction up until now, but in a few weeks it won't be
<interior_gummy> chan was born in poland
<RainBroDash> 10we'll just be a pony stream site
<GamerGodJones> Poland?
<GamerGodJones> Really
<SirSprinkles> 6Uh, no, we're known as a theater-esque site.
<RainBroDash> 10general pony and pony accessories* stream site
<SirSprinkles> 6That's the whole point.
<Octavia> 14I think maybe it should stretch a little further horizontally
<ThePretender> HNNNNGH
<Aponymous> Srs?
<Combustiblelemons> buffering.
<ThePretender> HERCULES MUSIC
<FreezeFrame> He was born in Hong Kong
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Aponymous> BUFFER!
<GamerGodJones> Everyday im bufferin'
<interior_gummy> pinkiedash
<GabeMoist> ohai buffer
<PrincePOLO> THIS one never gets old
<SirSprinkles> 6I dislike buffer.
<DuskShine> Dashiepie, Gummy. Dashiepie.
<Combustiblelemons> play snake whilst you buffer!
<PrincePOLO> unless it loads
<prince-dari> I think our plan is to branch out.
<Aponymous> Buffer = New Tacowiz
<Ziltoid> SirSprinkles y u so buffer
<SirReginald> dat buffer
<GamerGodJones> Oh lord
<Elky> yay
<Ziltoid> EEYUP
<GabeMoist> Tacowiz x Buffer
<RainBroDash> 10we're known as that, but we're also moving into the S2 thing, and becoming less of a one-attraction pony
<The_Si> *reads description below*
<Dashite> DuskShine, no Rainbow Pie?
<prince-dari> DCD sees us as being bronies' biggest media site soon or something.
<Elky> best pmv coming up
<The_Si> Huh, On Air.
<ValtheJean> I've heard talk of expansion, so I would say the theme of the banner depends on if/how far we want to expand
<SirReginald> Those eyes!
<Octavia> 14DCD talked about putting a lot of new stuff on the site I think.
<herospirit> D---> Oh My
<DuskShine> Dashie Pie is cuter.
<FreezeFrame> Who's streaming?
<Ziltoid> this is SirSprinkles favorite song
<GamerGodJones> 0.o
<prince-dari> LOL
<interior_gummy> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Elky> sprinkles
<Nittany_Tiger> My head hurts from eye strain. :<
<herospirit> D----> I Think I Require
<DuskShine> Besides, we already have Rainbow Sparkle.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd like to put new stuff on the site, but w/e. Now's not the time for that.
<herospirit> D-----> A Towel
<Combustiblelemons> this song... do not like
<Octavia> 14Honestly, I dont know about -biggest- media site, but he wants to incorporate things like draw chats and such and archives
<Elky> ziltoid: if so, Sprinkles gan get himself a brohoof from me
<prince-dari> >brain parasite that takes over rats' brains and makes them walk towards cats to get eaten
<Aponymous> WHY DO I NOT WANT TO CUT MY EARS OFF?
<ThePretender> is it bad that this is oddly catchy?
<GamerGodJones> THis song, in my head, FOREEEEVVVVVVVVERRRRRRRRRR
<RainBroDash> 10seen that, hilarious
<DuskShine> Why is this song so catchy?
<Octavia> 14...
<Luna> 07so many plans... so little time
<prince-dari> >50% of all people on the Earth are infected with it
<ValtheJean> you've mentioned that before dari, but we *really* need to stay focused
<Combustiblelemons> i don't like it :/
<DuskShine> By all rights I should hate it but... I don't. =/
<ThePretender> same
<RainBroDash> 10but sprinkles we're commissioning for a new banner for moneys, just think we might want to incorporate our expansion into that
<Aponymous> Maybe it's because Rarity...
<PrincePOLO> Yup it's catchy
<GamerGodJones> I think "I cant decide" is FAR more catchy
<GamerGodJones> By the scissor sisters or somthing like that
<prince-dari> When I have nothing to contribute with the current conversation I go off topic.
<FreezeFrame> Yeah
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<FreezeFrame> Andcreepy
<Aponymous> Is there a I Can't Decide PMV? There should be.
<GamerGodJones> Yep
<FreezeFrame> For Pinkie, of course
<GamerGodJones> WIth pinkie pie and dash
<prince-dari> I don't have anything to say on the MadMax topic.
<Combustiblelemons> there is sorta
<Octavia> 14lol
<SirSprinkles> 6And yet why would we have a banner that includes future things in it? It makes no sense to advertise for things that you don't yet do.
<Combustiblelemons> best antagonist = nightmare moon. the end
<ThePretender> there's a pretty good "D-City Rock" PMV out there
<Aponymous> The Gary's Mod video right?
<GamerGodJones> Search Pinkie pie cant decide
<herospirit> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpvm4g489b1qmkva0o2_500.gif
<Combustiblelemons> yeah
<RainBroDash> 10I never said put 'BronyState: #1 S2 stream site'
<ValtheJean> well depending on how steep the price is, we could do a theater related one now, and then do another later down the road
<herospirit> Equius watches MLP for the plot
<Octavia> 14We could try to vaguely point at other things? I dunno lol
<RainBroDash> 10just maybe move -away- from the theatre thing
<Elky> who doesn't?
<Combustiblelemons> zav kinda made it longer than it needed to be
<Aponymous> There should be one for the whole song.
<RainBroDash> 10idk, it was just a thought>.>
<herospirit> http://www.leethacker.com/images/4vw7qsn0e1lf308if85o.png
<GamerGodJones> the plot is my favorite part *Creepy wink*
<Nittany_Tiger> I voted Nightmare Moon in that poll.
<prince-dari> Well have the text "BronyState" and don't have it themed like a theatre.
<DrFumbles> I just got back, I immediately regret it it
<GamerGodJones> Welcome back i gues
<RainBroDash> 10that's what I was attempting to get at maybe
<SirSprinkles> 6>move away from what we're known for
<DrFumbles> lol
<Combustiblelemons> T_T
<DrFumbles> song
<GamerGodJones> OH I CANT DECIDE
<Aponymous> I couldn't decide between Nightmare Moon and THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE.
<interior_gummy> voted for nm
<prince-dari> We're not even known for streaming a lot now.
<GamerGodJones> WEATHER YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE
<SirReginald> notsureifokaywiththis.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6lol wut?
<Elky> Brace yourself for later, there's only going to be one request I'll make
<prince-dari> A fair number of people find the site and don't know about BMN.
<Elky> and of course it'll be sea poies
<Combustiblelemons> it's too femenine!
<GabeMoist> SHOO BE DOO
<ThePretender> SHOO BE DOO
<Combustiblelemons> it buuurns!
<ValtheJean> well, this is something to note:
<interior_gummy> i think we all know what i will request
<ValtheJean> people may not know about us now
<ValtheJean> but when S2 hits
<Aponymous> o_O
<interior_gummy> MUAHAHAHAHAHA
<ThePretender> nooooo
<GamerGodJones> notsureifwant.png
<RainBroDash> 10well it's a balance between our old-school movie theatre image, and the whole newfangled S2 style we're implementing, and we're expecting a huuge load more viewers
<ValtheJean> it's going to explode
<FreezeFrame> My request is Moskau
<prince-dari> The point is if you aren't always looking to expand and get new people, you die Sprinkles.
<Combustiblelemons> i swear sparkle is doing this just to troll me D:
<RainBroDash> 10Sprinkles is deaaaad D:
<ThePretender> my request is the Ace Combat Zero trailer
<GamerGodJones> I request Moskau or Pinkie Pie cant decide
<prince-dari> If you just keep things the same, let it get stale, it will die.
<Nightshade> whats that the next song is derpalicious?
<PrincePOLO> I request Half Life Episode 3
<Zecora> ^
<ThePretender> I request money
<Elky> so... what's the point of Pony vs. Pony?
<DrFumbles> ditto
<Combustiblelemons> SHHH....
<prince-dari> Over time your members are going to leave.
<ThePretender> lots of it
<prince-dari> You need to do something to get new members.
<Elky> seems kinda boring to me
<Combustiblelemons> don't say that. Gabe's watching >.>
<GabeMoist> I request Minecraft 1.8 to be released
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes dari, but you don't advertise as doing something you don't yet do.
<RainBroDash> 10We're not advertising as anything new
<Combustiblelemons> now that is something I agree with
<GamerGodJones> @PrincePOLO THE GAME, WILL BE DELAYED, FOREVER! MUHAHAHAHAHAHA
<prince-dari> We won't be advertising anything.
<RainBroDash> 10just not dwelling on the movie theatre thing
<prince-dari> It'll just be a general banner.
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<prince-dari> Not movie specific.
<RainBroDash> 10just a ponyfied logo for BronyState
<Octavia> 14I could see a general banner still looking good
<Combustiblelemons> they announced it for 2012 I heard
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is why I don't want to give any guidelines... at all.
<prince-dari> ...
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll be a nice banner that says BronyState. >>;
<GamerGodJones> After the world ends
<ThePretender> I call shenanigans
<GabeMoist> The world will be gone by then
<mib_ftkbft> i must say, any song with a pony video makes the song thereafter, a good song
<GamerGodJones> AND hell freezes over
<PrincePOLO> fck, I just lost the reason to live ._.
<prince-dari> Well it should have the text "BronyState" on it.
<Silverscreen> 11...
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll be professional, because frankly why wouldn't it be?
<Luna> 07and could be used for other communication channels?
<Luna> 07newsletter/ facebook / twitter and so?
<Octavia> 14As long as she knows it has to say "BronyState" and what dimensions we need
<Aponymous> Episode Three will come out when Duke Nu- Oh wait, can't make that joke anymore...
<GamerGodJones> My reason to live is Season 2
<Combustiblelemons> why so girly with the songs?
<RainBroDash> 10yeah, just give bronystate and the sizing stuff
<GamerGodJones> How about after "Meet the pyro" comes out?
<Aponymous> That works.
<SirSprinkles> 6>said that was the plan ten minutes ago
<PrincePOLO> Oh, right, there's S2... ok I've got new reason
<SirSprinkles> 6Seriously guys... >>;
<GamerGodJones> Ohai silverscreen
<Octavia> 14Well, there we go.
<Aponymous> OHAI SILVERSCREEN
<GabeMoist> Ohai
<Luna> 07alright next item
<Silverscreen> meh.
<GamerGodJones> yall took mah thing
<RainBroDash> 10who is 'guys'? nobody said we should put anything additional in the banner?
<Elky> hi silver.
<GamerGodJones> >.<
<Octavia> 14I still think though it sohuld be stretched maybe a little more horizontally. But eh.
<Combustiblelemons> And season 3, and season 4... maybe even S5 :D
<SirSprinkles> 6FAWK BUFFER
<Riders> How's your sex life, SILVERSCREEN
<ValtheJean> to be fair RBD I did
<Aponymous> That's the unoficial greeting of BMN.
<Elky> yfw there won't even be S4
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<Nightshade> o hey SilverSCreen
<DrFumbles> lol
<ValtheJean> but I'll happily back down to discuss other things
<Combustiblelemons> saved by the buffer.
<SirSprinkles> 6;-;
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<Pinkie_Pie> Why are we talking about Season 5? We should be pondering Season 12
<GamerGodJones> Whats the deal with all these girly songs broski?
<ThePretender> DAT BUFFER
<Combustiblelemons> D:
<RainBroDash> 10mkaay, so what's next sathi?
<GabeMoist> It's a sign
<DrFumbles> lololololllklhiogbl

<SirSprinkles> 6BUFFER WHY?
<mib_ftkbft> lol
<ValtheJean> ah
<Nittany_Tiger> Is this Rarity hour?
<Ziltoid> YEAH
<RandomExtra> Possibly
<FreezeFrame> I approve of Holding Out For A Hero
<PrincePOLO> I imagine MLP FiM to have as many seasons and realted series as Stargate
<GabeMoist> NOPE
<Ziltoid> NO
<GamerGodJones> I WANT TO SEE EXPLODING MONSTERTRUCKS GAHRHAHRAGH!
<Riders> Girly songs to a show with a primary demographic of girls. Revolutionary!
<ThePretender> keep loading, loading, loading
<Octavia> 14The script is good and simply when its actually working.
<RainBroDash> 10what about it? Is it in need of changing?
<Aponymous> FACKING BUFFER!
<SirSprinkles> 6lol BUFFER
<ThePretender> DAT AD
<GabeMoist> Buffer: No more Rarity
<Zecora> dat ad
<prince-dari> It only doesn't work when I'm not here.
<Luna> 07.. did you see the topic on the forums?
<prince-dari> :P
<Octavia> 14*simple
<Combustiblelemons> this is okay.
<GamerGodJones> ohai advert
<PrincePOLO> epic ad
<Octavia> 14lol Dari
<ValtheJean> well, for one we've had complaints about picking anons/afk'ers
<Luna> 07come on please i'm not posting for fun on there...
<Nittany_Tiger> Ad for older MLP?
<Aponymous> There's one for this song? Sweet! FUCK YOU BUFFER!
<Combustiblelemons> wtf... G3 IT BURNS
<mib_ftkbft> dat ad is a link to a website thats unsafe
<Luna> 07there's some serious things we need to fix / improve
<PrincePOLO> ok so now maybe... Supersonic PMV?
<mib_ftkbft> that will give u viruses
<GamerGodJones> To the ladies? sonofa...
<RainBroDash> 10sorry Luna i find it hard to keep track of everything everywhere >.>
<Elky> Night of Pony?
<Octavia> 14About the anons, I dont mind. People afk, eh...
<GabeMoist> inb4buffer
<herospirit> O GOG
<mib_ftkbft> i scanned it lol
<Combustiblelemons> AWWW YEAHHH
<herospirit> WHY
<SirReginald> lol
<Zecora> a bottle of jack .........
<Nightshade> noooooooo
<ThePretender> I am fully convince Kesha's musical career is a parody
<Nightshade> noooooooooooooooooooo
<FreezeFrame> Ugh, Ke$ha
<prince-dari> What's your point?
<Nightshade> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Aponymous> ......
<RainBroDash> 10what thread is it in?
<Combustiblelemons> I tried to close the ad... lol
<prince-dari> If they're AFK we move over to the next person.
<prince-dari> Why does it matter?
<ValtheJean> well, as bjorn put it, a lot of anons didn't have a movie in mind, and got frustrated
<PrincePOLO> It reminds me of Reimagine: The gAme
<Ziltoid> AWFUL SONG
<GamerGodJones> My toaster sings better than Ke$ha
<DrFumbles> FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU-!
<Combustiblelemons> UMAD everyone?
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly I'd like to take anons off the script, if possible.
<Aponymous> FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<Octavia> 14Then we skip to next person.
<ThePretender> still, Ke-dollar sign-sha is funny
<herospirit> GOG WWWWHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYyy
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, her name has a dollar sign in it.
<Nightshade> we need more andrew W K part songs!
<The_Si> WITH BIKINIS ON TOP
<DrFumbles> YES
<GabeMoist> Fing Buffer!
<prince-dari> Not possible.
<Ziltoid> TERRIBAD
<Combustiblelemons> *trollface*
<GabeMoist> WHERE ARE YOU!?
<Aponymous> I MAD
<prince-dari> They're aren't 'anon'.
*Ziltoid mutes stream
<ponywithafez> WHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHY?
<SirSprinkles> 6Then we'll just skip them when they come up on the list.
<SirSprinkles> 6Agreed?
<prince-dari> They're just randomised names mibbit comes up with.
<Luna> 07YES
<Silverscreen> 11They're mib_randomname
<RainBroDash> 10any ideas for a new opt-in system?
<GamerGodJones> I think sirsprinkles is trying to kill us
<Nittany_Tiger> She's probably just being made popular by her labe,l not her talent.
<GabeMoist> COME TO ME BUFFER
<Combustiblelemons> I don't mind this music.
<Elky> tbh I can't actually bring myself to hate most of these stupid pop songs
<RainBroDash> 10some people might get annoyed with that
<prince-dari> What makes you think all the mib users don't want the chance to pick a movie anyway?
<Combustiblelemons> it's tolerable ^_^
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll require a script.
<PrincePOLO> Buffer hates us
<RainBroDash> 10they might not have picked a name yet
<Elky> I know I should
<ValtheJean> well I mentioned the idea of doing the lotto based on movies, not viewers. What were your thoughts on that?
<Nightshade> i can Elky :D
<DrFumbles> LOL DRAMATIC READING
<RainBroDash> 10and they may still want a movie recommended
<Aponymous> Streamer is all "Problem, Bronies?"
<SirSprinkles> 6-_-;
<GamerGodJones> We should listen to "Rainbow Factory"
<DrFumbles> OF THIS SONG
<Nittany_Tiger> In other words, Ke$ha = corporate whore.
<SirSprinkles> 6No based on movies.
<RainBroDash> 10valthejean what do you have in mind?
<Elky> but I really hate those pretty boys with a guitar trying to seem sensitive
<ThePretender> the Cracked article of Ke- Dollar Sign - Sha is quite funny
<Dashite> Nittany_Tiger, it's right there in the name with the $
<DrFumbles> ya
<Aponymous> Elky: Everyone does.
<Nittany_Tiger> I know.
<Octavia> 14I agree its kinda unfair to just take them out of the lottery. But I know its also pretty simple to just pick a name.
<Combustiblelemons> Ass up by barracuda with rarity in it?
<ValtheJean> it would require a bit of revision to the lotto mind you
<Elky> pretender: by soren?
<ThePretender> I believe so, can't remember
<ValtheJean> but we basically have some way of submitting recommendations for movies prior to the stream
<SirSprinkles> 6...lol nope.
<Elky> Soren has all the best articles
<GamerGodJones> Do ponies have deoderent?
<Nittany_Tiger> More pop stars need currency signs in their names.
<ThePretender> Soren and DOB are best writers
<Combustiblelemons> it's soarin' btw
<Nittany_Tiger> Show their true "talent"
<RainBroDash> 10how about some kind of system where people PM a bot to request their movie, and we compile a list from there?
<Elky> SorenxSoarin
<ThePretender> just call me The YenTender then
<Silverscreen> 11I like the system we have. The only flaw in it is when people are chosen without knowing what they want. This doesn't happen too often and it's outweighed by people actually being able to voice their choices to everyone when they win.
<Elky> make it happen
<DuskShine> ... meh. The best thing about this song is ponies.
<SirSprinkles> 6No requesting ahead of time.
<Aponymous> DOB is awesome, anyone read that novel thing he wrote, Bartender? It's hilarious.
<SirSprinkles> 6Just... no.
<Combustiblelemons> ... that's just wrong elky
<Zecora> this was bad and you should feel bad
<RainBroDash> 10why not? D:
<SirSprinkles> 6It's as simple as no.
<GamerGodJones> Oh wait
<RainBroDash> 10that's really not very helpful :L
<Octavia> 14Then we'll probably just have a bunch of single movies, its not likely anyone will pick the same movie
<SirSprinkles> 6Because it brings serious stuff about whether we're biased.
<Dashite> Which Soren are we talking about here?
<Combustiblelemons> umad viewers?
<GamerGodJones> YOUR MUSIC'S BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD
<GGgala> oh gawd is that an d for G3.5 pony?
<Nittany_Tiger> G3 pony game. Play now!
<GGgala> *an ad
<GamerGodJones> Perfect space for that reference
<Elky> i so mad
<ThePretender> Cracked article writer Soren
<Combustiblelemons> zoidberg is amongst us!
<Zecora> Play Nao
<RainBroDash> 10makes sense I guess
<Combustiblelemons> AD, Y U NO G4
<PrincePOLO> Play it play it play it!
<Riders> In the words of Zoidberg: Your music's bad and you should feel bad!
<GabeMoist> Bohemian
<GamerGodJones> PLAH NAOUH AHGHHGHGERGHA
<ValtheJean> does it bring any more bias than when mods are selected for the lotto?
<ThePretender> WE'VE BEEN TROOLED
<GGgala> nooooo
<SirSprinkles> 6BUFFER WHY?
<typjk> awww yeaaah
<mib_ftkbft> omg
<Nittany_Tiger> Not the sea ponies.
<mib_ftkbft> NOOOOOOO
<ThePretender> YAY BUFFER
<prince-dari> Well, I have nothing else to say.
<GGgala> yay buffer!
<Riders> Okay now we're just being punished
<prince-dari> So.
<Nightshade> BUFFER FTW
<FreezeFrame> Buffer > Trolling
<Octavia> 14Its random.
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<RainBroDash> 10that's not bias at all, since it's random
<Nightshade> I LOVE YOU BUFFER
<Ziltoid> SHOOBE DOO
<GabeMoist> No
<RobotPinkie> NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO Y U BUFFER?
<prince-dari> Offtopic post. :D
<Elky> dammit
<GGgala> ThePretender: herdmind
<GamerGodJones> OH MY FUCKING LORD
<Aponymous> Youtube hates us, it really does.
<Zecora> buffer is trolling
<Elky> DAMMIT
<GabeMoist> WE'RE SAVED

<RobotPinkie> I wanted sea ponies :(
<prince-dari> >zombies exist
<ThePretender> moar like SHOO BE DON'T
<Aponymous> THEY HAVE SHOWN MERCY!
<Combustiblelemons> every day I'm bufferin'
<RainBroDash> 10O.o
<herospirit> ....
<ValtheJean> well so is any other idea...but whatevs. Let's move on then
<PrincePOLO> thank you mighty buffer!
<RainBroDash> 10in what sense?
<Octavia> 14Since everyone, including the mods are picked at random, its not biased.
<Elky> why interrupt the best mlp song ever?
<GamerGodJones> MIGHTY BUFFER GOD OF THE 8TH LAYER OF HELL, SAVE US
<Combustiblelemons> because troll internet.
<SirReginald> lol
<FreezeFrame> Silly Pony is the best one ever.
<Aponymous> The Gods of Buffer have taken pity upon us!
<prince-dari> RainBroDash: "What is definitely true is the story of Clairvius Narcisse. He was a Haitian guy who was declared dead by two doctors and buried in 1962. They found him wandering around the village 18 years later. It turned out the local voodoo priests had been using naturally occurring chemicals to basically zombify people and putting them to work on the sugar plantations "
<SirSprinkles> 6Knowing the movies ahead of time may bring up the idea of bias, even if we're not.
<Elky> oh, don't think you've escaped
<Combustiblelemons> STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
<GamerGodJones> STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCYM
<GamerGodJones> DAMMIT
<RainBroDash> 10ah yeah valthejean the difference is you can see the random part, so the person who's given the choice of film appears on the RNG and then chooses the film
<ThePretender> no one likes my joke :-;
<Combustiblelemons> ha.
<GabeMoist> SCYM
<Elky> I will find a way to bring sea ponies upon you
<PrincePOLO> wanka!
<SirSprinkles> 6People can go "HOW DO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT OUT OF THE LIST/PUT IT IN THE LIST MORE THAN ONCE?"
<SirReginald> Herbert West wouldn't be stopped by buffers.
<Combustiblelemons> yay! this is epic
<Aponymous> Pretender, I thought it was funny.
<ValtheJean> well I was just saying for the list, the actual randomization could still be done in stream
<Elky> Pretender: that pun gave me cancer
<SirSprinkles> 6Doesn't matter.
<GamerGodJones> So does this mean Twilight lives in a van?
<Combustiblelemons> herbert west's internet never dies.
<ThePretender> all in a day's work
<GamerGodJones> Cause sniper does
<Riders> ThePretender = Your joke is bad and you should feel bad!
<Silverscreen> 11Sprinkles, are you doing requests?
<crono_flash> Is there a giant robot night tonight?
<RobotPinkie> well, at least Lord Blueberry Snuggle is level 4 now...
<RainBroDash> 10I agree sirsprinkles. So we make the decision at the moment between people getting flustered and not knowing what film to pick, or people criticising the system for possible bias reasons
<SirSprinkles> 6Not at the moment.
<SirSprinkles> 6I've already stated this.
<ThePretender> I can't help being "punny"
<prince-dari> Let's vote.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari.
<prince-dari> >Any other alternate system, or just the current system
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not done talking about it yet.
<GamerGodJones> GO DIE FOR THAT JOKE THEPRETENDER
<PrincePOLO> next, can we have Supersonic? :fluttershymode_on: I mean, if you want too... I mean I don't... emmm...:fluttershymode_off:
<Silverscreen> 11Current system.
<GamerGodJones> CODEFAIL
<SirSprinkles> 6FFS
<Ziltoid> super magic sprinkles will destroy all ponies
<SirSprinkles> 6Let me finish guys.
<Combustiblelemons> oooh.
<FreezeFrame> buffer
<Ziltoid> UGH
<prince-dari> Well if most people are satisfied with the current system what does it matter?
<RainBroDash> 10dari haitian voodoo is crazy
<GamerGodJones> oh yayt
<Combustiblelemons> which one is this?
<FreezeFrame> This stream is buffer
<Aponymous> OH YEAH!
<GamerGodJones> yep yayt
<PrincePOLO> buffer!
<Combustiblelemons> *troll buffer*
<Aponymous> FUCK
<Combustiblelemons> Y U NO REFRESH
<Zecora> wow that sewwtiebell look
<Combustiblelemons> that helps right?
<Zecora> derp
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd like to have a script that opts them in. That way we don't have people afk or wanting to be skipped.
<GamerGodJones> WHY GODS OF THE BUFFER? CHOOSE WHETHER YOU HATE OR LOVE US
<prince-dari> I don't like that version.
<Nightshade> they can't it'll take to long to buffer
<SirSprinkles> 6Why not?
<GamerGodJones> So how many people here are actually from the UK and whatnot
<Aponymous> Oh well, at least I downloaded all those songs.
<Luna> 07<< netherlands
<EmmettBrown> Well,I'm back
<Zecora> < germaney
<DecapKing> HAI OCTAVIA!
<DecapKing> <Russia
<Elky> < germany
<ThePretender> DAT OCTAVIA
<prince-dari> It actually requires people to do stuff, which means we'll inevitably get endless spam from people saying it's not working, how do I do it, etc.
<Combustiblelemons> classical music time.
<GamerGodJones> <Doesnt even know where the netherlands are lol
<prince-dari> Assume people are stupid.
<Elky> bah, octavia
<RainBroDash> 10true
<prince-dari> It's a good assumption.
<SirSprinkles> 6It'd be a button.
<SirSprinkles> 6Just a button.
<PrincePOLO> <Poland
<prince-dari> A button...?
<sotha> <California
<GamerGodJones> Man, i need a damn map
<RobotPinkie> << Sweden
<RainBroDash> 10I'd love to see the coding for said button O.o
<prince-dari> How are you planning to implement this?
<SirSprinkles> 6It'd take the name they're using in the chat and send it to us.
<RobotPinkie> (best country)
<Aponymous> Octavia is best Background Pony, because classy.
<Apokalipse> <Slovenia
<Combustiblelemons> ಠ_ರೃ quite.
<Nightshade> < England
<GamerGodJones> <New Hampshire
<RobotPinkie> trolololo
<EmmettBrown> Blanketed on top of the Moon's crust is a highly comminuted (broken into ever smaller particles) and impact gardened surface layer called regolith, formed by impact processes. The finer regolith, the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass, has a texture like snow and smell like spent gunpowder.
<SirReginald> I'm from America's Mitten. :D
<Aponymous> <New York
<Elky> all background ponies are horrible
<typjk> germany
*Silverscreen 11sighs.
<ThePretender> <NYC
<Elky> there really is no 'best'
<Ziltoid> ELFY TROLOLOLOL
<GamerGodJones> LYRA IS NOT HORRIBLE GOOD SIR
<Combustiblelemons> Elky shall burn for that.
<ThePretender> moon cannon time?
<GamerGodJones> OR MADAM
<prince-dari> Well now you've told us the way you'd rather do it, can we vote?
<Octavia> 14Also have to make it so they couldnt send in their name more than once though... to up their chances
<Apokalipse> Elky you silly troll
<GamerGodJones> I HAVE NO IDEA
<Combustiblelemons> yes.
<RainBroDash> 10GamerGodJones I'm from england :P
<Elky> only seapony!Lyra is good
<Silverscreen> 11...you're making this complicated when what we have happening works just fine. We don't need to change it for the sake of convenience when our current strategy has no major flaws.
<GamerGodJones> Yeah, new england is cooler tho rainbrodash
<Combustiblelemons> prepare the orbital friendship laser to finish him off
<SirSprinkles> 6Octy, alphabetized list would make doubles obvious.
<GamerGodJones> thats why its NEW
<Aponymous> Music playing Pony with Bow tie, horrible? I don't get it.
<Octavia> 14Personally, I'm fine with our current system
<Nightshade> nope
<Nittany_Tiger> USA has best weather.
<Combustiblelemons> derpy/bonbon?
<Nightshade> England is better than New England :P
<Elky> all other bg ponies are just one little step above OCs
<Combustiblelemons> USA is doomed.
<SirSprinkles> 6I have no issue with the current system.
<SirReginald> I agree
<GamerGodJones> NIEN NIGHTSHADE
<SirSprinkles> 6However viewers seem to.
<PrincePOLO> yup
<GamerGodJones> England got boring
<SirSprinkles> 6And that's my concern.
<Nittany_Tiger> We're doomed, but still have best weather.
<GamerGodJones> So they made new england
<GamerGodJones> we rule
<RainBroDash> 10I think our current system the probable same chance for complication as the other possible ones. Viewers having problems is kinda inevitable
<Silverscreen> 11I haven't heard any complaints.
<Luna> 07Well if we all agree on keeping the same it stays.
<Elky> honestly, I can't tell how much of what I write is trolling
<Octavia> 14Be a little upset, yes. But jeez. Cant always have everything perfect either.
<Combustiblelemons> >inb4 bankruptcy, social collapse and civil war.
<Luna> 07let's move on
<Silverscreen> 11And half the time that I do, it's just that they're bitching because they aren't selected.
<SirReginald> Should get a Trollometer
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<GamerGodJones> There is a thin line between trolling and stupidity
<ThePretender> Civil War? Hated that comic
<Octavia> 14lol
<Aponymous> YES!
<Nittany_Tiger> Honestly, that would be nice.
<Bjornfot> ...are y'all gonna play super shoobedoo beat?
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, that's it for now.
<Combustiblelemons> YAY
<Octavia> 14I havent heard any concerns myself yet, but people will inevitably bitch no matter what for whatever reasons
<PrincePOLO> ok now pray to the gods of buffer to have mercy!
<Nightshade> I'm one of the people help making it more fun :D
<Combustiblelemons> NOOOOOOO
<Nittany_Tiger> Democrat v. Republican civil war. Might happen.
<prince-dari> So can we discuss what we need to do for S2?
<Octavia> 14Ponies!
<GamerGodJones> Im independant
<Combustiblelemons> the internet hates us.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll frankly be in Canada then.
<GamerGodJones> so what does that make me
<SirSprinkles> 6We need the streamers here to discuss it, dari.
<Aponymous> POLO, you just HAD to say something, didn't you?
<ThePretender> NOOOOOO, DAMN YOU BUFFER, I LOVE THIS SONG
<prince-dari> Nope.
<SirSprinkles> 6So... we're pretty much set.
<prince-dari> I mean website wise.
<DuskShine> ... eh. This isn't the better one. =/
<PrincePOLO> Buffer.... you're dead to me
<Combustiblelemons> :Darthvaderno:
<Ziltoid> derp
<GamerGodJones> BRB EVERYBODY I NEED TO USE THE URINATION STATION
<Ziltoid> lol private
<GamerGodJones> JUST A PSA
<DuskShine> Ohai, private video!
<Combustiblelemons> as do O
<SirReginald> nooooo
<Combustiblelemons> as do I
<Elky> if we can't have sea ponies, we won't have anything else
<SirSprinkles> 6What have we not discussed?
<RainBroDash> 10I want to know about this mod/admin thing and the mod teams
<RainBroDash> 10if that's alright :L
<Nittany_Tiger> Buffering is going to die. It prevented a sonic rainboom.
<Nittany_Tiger> That is inexcusable.
<Nightshade> buffergod, you buffer then
<Nightshade> them*
<RandomExtra> ...
<prince-dari> I dunno, I can't make it unless I know exactly what I'm diong.
<prince-dari> doing*
<Silverscreen> 11Making our partnership with Brony Show official.
*ThePretender grabs a pitchfork and menaces towards the buffer.
<SirSprinkles> 6The light system, dari?
<prince-dari> How do people navigate to the different rooms?
<RainBroDash> 10gamergodjones.. no, just no
<ValtheJean> we've got a partnership with Brony Show? O_o
<PrincePOLO> I think mighty buffer gods aer just trolling us
<PrincePOLO> are
<prince-dari> Do they click the main 6 pictures?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, dari.
<Silverscreen> 11Brony Show constantly advertises BMN
<prince-dari> Do the pictures get locked when the rooms are full?
<SirSprinkles> 6No.
<Shiggy> hello
<prince-dari> How should the traffic lights be made?
<interior_gummy> the moment requests open up is the moment i deliver the great and mighty dikekike
<Silverscreen> 11We can make an official partnership with them and support each other.
<Riders> Everybodies sanity slip.
<prince-dari> What are they?
<prince-dari> Flash, pictures using javascript?
<SirSprinkles> 6Silver, can it wait a moment.
<SirSprinkles> 6Flash preferably.
<Ziltoid> i love rarity so much
<Combustiblelemons> back
*Silverscreen 11quiets.
<SirSprinkles> 6Whichever is easier for you to code, dari.
<Nittany_Tiger> Cat lady picture incoming.
<GamerGodJones> NOW IM BACK
<PrincePOLO> IMHO RArity and Twilight are the most sane
<sotha> What is the domain for the bronystate chat? I am trying to get in on my new computer, but it is just a blank blue screen.
<DecapKing> what are we watching?
<GamerGodJones> DId you all miss me?
<RainBroDash> 10nope :p
<DecapKing> i didnt at all
<RobotPinkie> lol
<GamerGodJones> D:
<prince-dari> So all the different chat rooms have different links?
<GamerGodJones> *Cries*
<DecapKing> i liked when you were away
<Combustiblelemons> poor dashie...
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<prince-dari> (essentially rendering the frontend pointless)
<Elky> someone was away?
<DecapKing> i am a cruel person
<Combustiblelemons> you want to give her a hug :(
<SirSprinkles> 6How does that render anything pointless?
<RainBroDash> 10yeah people will bookmark their main one :P
<GamerGodJones> FOOLPROOF TRAP
<prince-dari> ^
<DecapKing> because i find it funny, cause i am twisted
<RainBroDash> 10the majority of recurring viewers anyway
<SirSprinkles> 6Who cares?
<sotha> Um. . . did any mod get that?
<interior_gummy> rarity is a brazilian stripper?
<Nittany_Tiger> Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie have the best sanity slips.
<SirSprinkles> 6Doesn't make it useless.
<PrincePOLO> suddenly, Flutterrage
<SirReginald> lol
<Combustiblelemons> I finished before you gamergodjones.
<SirSprinkles> 6New people will need to be directed.
<Elky> ...
<GamerGodJones> I got myself a soda too
<interior_gummy> applejack doesn't even really have one
<Combustiblelemons> :D
<GGgala> sotha: do you mean www.bronystate.co.cc ?
<interior_gummy> she's just tired
<GamerGodJones> SO i might be faster than you
<PrincePOLO> man i love this part :DDD
<Combustiblelemons> so did I :P
<GamerGodJones> We need to have a contest
<SirSprinkles> 6And if they don't pay attention to the lights, it's their fault if they whine about not being able to get in when it's closed.
<ThePretender> oh man, THIS part
<Combustiblelemons> god that is really weird...
<PrincePOLO> this one as well :D
<GamerGodJones> No ive said wierder
<Combustiblelemons> it's like theres another me on earth
<GamerGodJones> Im sorry?
<Aponymous> Why do I like Pinkamena so much?
<Silverscreen> 11...if Dari was good with CSS, clicking on the picture could change the style and connections while keeping it on the same page.
<herospirit> This party seems legit
<RainBroDash> 10well just saying something is their fault doesn't help that much. you kinda have to assume a lot of people are dumb enough to get it wrong, and failsafe it as well as you can
<Combustiblelemons> ah never mind lol
<ThePretender> PREETY RUDE? IT WAZ DOWNRIGHT DEEZPICABLE!
<DecapKing> cause she is insane
<sotha> GGgala: No. I'm on dinkypage, and the stream works fine. In the chat, however, there is no tab for bronystate, so I was wondering how I actually get there? (because normally it just shows up automatically, you know...)
<ValtheJean> out of curiosity
<prince-dari> Requires more than just CSS to do that Silver.
<PrincePOLO> because she's Pinkamena?
<ValtheJean> would we as mods have the ability to transfer people to other rooms?
<Shiggy> rocky is talking about apollo creed
<prince-dari> But yeah I can have multiple style sheets and switch them.
<GamerGodJones> Whats the name of the bucket of turnips?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, Val.
<GGgala> sotha: type /join #BronyState ?
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, not forcibly.
*Silverscreen 11is just tossing random thoughts out to feel like part of the conversation.
<PrincePOLO> Mr. Turnip?
<prince-dari> I did the for the konami code on the front page.
<Aponymous> Eh, makes sense.
<prince-dari> that*
<GamerGodJones> Really? just Mr. Turnip/
<prince-dari> Switches out style sheets.
<interior_gummy> madame le flour is best pony
<Combustiblelemons> yep.
<GamerGodJones> How boring, he was my favorite
<PrincePOLO> I think so
<Combustiblelemons> hold on actually. someone made them ponies
<prince-dari> But the problem is it'd also have to switch the HTML.
<prince-dari> And I'm not sure if I can do that.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm just trying to keep this easiest for everyone, since we have little time.
<GamerGodJones> Got pics of it?
<PrincePOLO> I'm getting sleepy
<sotha> GGgala: Um. . . it didn't do anything. It's just a blank blue field.
<GamerGodJones> Wow that sounded creepy, anyway
<interior_gummy> I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I'VE HAD ENOUGH
*RobotPinkie buffers
<DuskShine> Dat buffer.
*Nittany_Tiger explodes
<Aponymous> We meet again, Buffer
<PrincePOLO> yay buffer ... =.=
<Combustiblelemons> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GHwuZjgTcvU/TlfpuekLF4I/AAAAAAAAABg/ih38fJxUyp0/s1600/party_of_four_by_frostheartissiamese-d3k0vip.png
<Combustiblelemons> there you go
<ThePretender> BUFFER, Y U TERROR
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder if I can get a .mp3 of the CMC background song.
<Combustiblelemons> pinkies "friends" as ponies.
*Shiggy lol
<Aponymous> That is great!
<GGgala> sotha: wait. i'm confused. so you're on http://dinkypage.com/BronyState and watching the stream there. and there's a big blue square next to/beneath the stream where chat should be?
<prince-dari> Also, the only way I can think of making the room system work as is without trying to code a server module or make a new client is for when someone tries to join a channel, if the channel is not full the bot will invite the person to the channel and notify them that they can now join, or if it is full tell them they can't and to try another room
<PrincePOLO> too perfect
<Combustiblelemons> mr turnip looks epic imo
<prince-dari> So the first join will fail because the room's invite only.
<Nittany_Tiger> Streamer's internet is horrible today.
<GamerGodJones> I dont like his colors
<prince-dari> Dunno if everyone's alright with that.
<PrincePOLO> needs to be saved!
<GamerGodJones> I prefer the bucket actually lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Works for me.
<ThePretender> Madame LeFlour is best insane pony
<Luna> 07works for me
<Octavia> 14Sounds reasonable.
<ValtheJean> so when people try to join for the first time, they'll get rejected?
<PrincePOLO> Rocky lokks like a badass
<prince-dari> Yes.
<PrincePOLO> looks
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, but it'll send an instant invite.
<SirSprinkles> 6If it's not full.
<prince-dari> The first join is automatic because of mibbit though.
<GamerGodJones> Mr. Turnip is, edible i guess, he is a bucket with turnips in it
<prince-dari> Just a though...
<ValtheJean> well I suppose that could be okay. Though we should add a FaQ to our page
<prince-dari> Whichever room URL you're on.
<ValtheJean> explaining this to the viewers
<prince-dari> You can join any of the rooms from it.
<prince-dari> Rendering this WHOLE system pointless.
<PrincePOLO> Flutterguy!
<herospirit> SHE STOLE MY SONG
<SirSprinkles> 6Not really.
<herospirit> SHE'S SUCK A BITCH
<prince-dari> Because they can access any of the rooms from any of the pages.
<DecapKing> FLUTTERGUY!!!
<herospirit> Such*
<prince-dari> thought*
<Combustiblelemons> watch out...
<ThePretender> Pinkie > Buffer
<Combustiblelemons> smooth jazz fluttershy.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, there will be a point to multiple pages.
<Aponymous> I would go to any party that had an invite like this.
<SirSprinkles> 6There'll be a theme to them all in the future.
<Combustiblelemons> I hope flutterguy makes a return actually.
<PrincePOLO> I prefer Piknie turret version of this one
<GamerGodJones> Does anybody know if there is a Reanimator pony fanfic? or do i have to go annoy ponychan
<DuskShine> Likewise, Aponymous.
<RobotPinkie> I would go to any Party that Pinkie Pie hosted, period.
<Combustiblelemons> I think there is actually gamergodjones
<PrincePOLO> suddenly, Timmy Turner
<herospirit> TWILIGHT = BEST PONY. Pinkie said so
<Nightshade> no not this
<prince-dari> Theme won't match the room you're in necessarily though.
<prince-dari> Because you can join whichever you want.
<SirSprinkles> 6Won't matter.
<ThePretender> herospirit, agreed
<prince-dari> So it doesn't matter which room you choose to join on the main page.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's for the enjoyment of the viewers.
*Silverscreen 11is lurking at this point.
<Combustiblelemons> that's your opinion and I respect it.
<Combustiblelemons> the end ^_^
<herospirit> dat fluttershy face
<Silverscreen> 11if that's the case, I redirect you to my previous suggestion:
<PrincePOLO> suddne;y, buff... nah it's boring
<GamerGodJones> Where would it be then
<Combustiblelemons> aww :D
<RobotPinkie> That's like... your opinion, man.
<Silverscreen> 11Do it like Ponychan does. Give a Themes option tab.
<Aponymous> Spike is best pony. :/
<GamerGodJones> Because i cant find anything ever, its like a curse
<herospirit> nice place to buffer
<sotha> GGgala: Well, there is still the white upper border that says "chat by Mibbit.com," which is still a link to Mibbit, but there is no #BronyState (#) tab. The actual chat itself is solid blue, with no scroll bars or viewer list or anything, and there is a white border on the bottom in which text can be entered, but it doesn't show up anywhere or do anything.
<prince-dari> That can be done.
<PrincePOLO> Gummy is my favourite pony
<Silverscreen> 11Simple and easy.
<RobotPinkie> everyone knows Scoot Scootaloo is best, though
<Combustiblelemons> theres a macro of that!
<RainBroDash> 10I wonder what might come of people being in more than one chat at once
<herospirit> Hey, I think every Pony is Best Pony.
<PrincePOLO> oh this one
<Combustiblelemons> half my brain is full of pony macros D:
<SirSprinkles> 6We'd have to have a list of rooms off to the side, though...
<ThePretender> damn you buffer
<Nittany_Tiger> XD
<GamerGodJones> Fluttershy is my favorite tree
<Nightshade> have you buffered I beg?
<SirSprinkles> 6So people know what rooms there are.
<herospirit> But Pinkie said Twilight was Best Pony in that song.
<Luna> 07buffer likes to buffer us tonight
<sotha> GGgala: it is the same with bronystate.co.cc, as well as its popout chat.
<Silverscreen> 11It'd be a part of the FAQ
<RobotPinkie> wtf Youtube?
*ThePretender weeps in despair at the cruel fate destiny is handing us tonight
<RainBroDash> 10since people will join Rainbow Dash, but then /join Pinkie_Pie to see who's online
*Dermathil waves at every single brony in chat
<SirSprinkles> 6We could do one page, tab for themes, and invite only rooms.
<Riders> Has anybody drawn a Bloomberg pony yet?
<Combustiblelemons> youtube used buffer! it's super effective!
<SirSprinkles> 6Not a part of the FAQ.
<interior_gummy> CONFOUND THAT BUFFER
<SirSprinkles> 6Because we still need them to know if the room is full or not.
<Combustiblelemons> I don't think so.
<GamerGodJones> VIEWER IS NOW FURIOUS
<Nittany_Tiger> Gonna buffer soon.
<prince-dari> The bot will kick nicks in more than one room.
<SirReginald> critical hit!
<Nightshade> what is love? Buffer don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more
<prince-dari> And hostnames if necessary.
<GGgala> sotha: weird... what browser are you using? what OS is the new computer?
<RobotPinkie> Confound these ponies, they drive m-... buffering... buffering...
<SirSprinkles> 6That works.
<Dermathil> REFRESH STREAM we are already past the buffer
*DecapKing hugs Luna for no real reason
<PrincePOLO> Will buffer when Dash's part starts
<GabeMoist> What is Buffer
<Combustiblelemons> please let this play buffer
*Luna gets hugged
<Nightshade> hugs for luna you say?
<Silverscreen> 11I like that.
*RobotPinkie hugs Luna for an actual reason
<prince-dari> Also, what do you want to call the roon that everyone can join?
*GabeMoist sacrifices virgins to the buffer gods
*Nightshade hugs Luna
<prince-dari> room*
<Combustiblelemons> Sells food at a place where there is free food.
<Luna> 07hmm storm arrived
<EmmettBrown> More moon trivia?
<Luna> 07sec looking at sat pics
<SirSprinkles> 6...what room?
<GamerGodJones> TOO MUCH HUG, NICENESS OVERLOAD
<Combustiblelemons> applejack, you so silleh.
<herospirit> I'd buy those appletastic treats
*Apokalipse hugs Luna
<ValtheJean> Canterlot? Ponyville? I dunno
<sotha> GGgala: It is window's 7, and I'm using SRWare Iron, essentially Chrome. It is the same as the laptop I'm using now, as far as I can tell. . .
<interior_gummy> derpy
<Silverscreen> 11a mane room that has no cap.
<SirSprinkles> 6...NO.
<prince-dari> Room which everyone can join, but there's a throttle of 1 message every minute or longer.
<ThePretender> I've been dreaming, I've been waiting to fly with those great ponies, the Wonderbolts, their daring tricks, spinning around, having kicks
<Shiggy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzDy22hCVZA
<herospirit> She only has pie, and one is Soar's
<EmmettBrown> I've still got plenty left
<SirSprinkles> 6Trottle?
<SirSprinkles> 6...okay then...
<RobotPinkie> inb4 best part
<Silverscreen> 11Throttle*
<sotha> GGgala: Interestingly enough, it says 3503:14:02:20 until next stream.
<PrincePOLO> Rainbows shat now
<Dermathil> Hmmmm. I don't see more than a handful of regulars ATM in chat.
<herospirit> We will fight to the death for the other pie
<GabeMoist> inafter best part
<SirSprinkles> 6Gimme a second.
<RainBroDash> 10so like a slow room?
<RobotPinkie> Best part is Pinkie Pie, obviously
<prince-dari> Yeah, DCD and I discussed it a while back when talking about the pros/cons of the room system.
<RainBroDash> 10I dunno how well that might work though
<PacGamer> pinkie!
<Combustiblelemons> Dashie's part > all others.
<GGgala> sotha: o_0 that is... weird. it sounds like javascript is fucked, or something.
<RainBroDash> 10maybe just for off-peak times
<prince-dari> Off-peak is when it definitely wouldn't work.
<Riders> I love how even when Dash's hair is tamed, it's still kind of messy
<RainBroDash> 10but at peak times it'll be a flood and a half
<RainBroDash> 10oh, why?
<ThePretender> as she takes time just for MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<sotha> GGgala: Perhaps...
<GamerGodJones> Wow, looking at the general crowds at the grand gala, i hate all of them already
<EmmettBrown> The moon...is the oldest object orbiting the earth
<prince-dari> Due to the small number of people, and the infrequency at which they can talk to each other.
<EmmettBrown> See I got that off the top of my head
<GamerGodJones> HOW DO YOU KNOW EMMETTBROWN
<RainBroDash> 10very true ^^
<ThePretender> facts float above your head, Doc?
<PrincePOLO> He was there
<Nittany_Tiger> Could be older asteroids out there.
<RobotPinkie> that "time to next show" script has derped on me one too many times...
<Combustiblelemons> what about comets or meteors orbiting emmett?
<Nittany_Tiger> They don't orbit the earth.
<Combustiblelemons> some do
<Nittany_Tiger> Comets at least.
<prince-dari> We thought that all the separate rooms might make people feel a bit disconnected from all the other people in other rooms, so having one big room everyone could be in might be a good idea for the best of both worlds.
<Nittany_Tiger> No comets do.
<Combustiblelemons> well not comets i guess
<EmmettBrown> The rocks collected from the Moon are measured by radiometric dating techniques. They range in age from about 3.16 billion years old for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, up to about 4.5 billion years old for rocks derived from the highlands
<RobotPinkie> lol Twi's face
<GamerGodJones> What about the sun, according to the bible the sun revolvs around us....
<RainBroDash> 10yeah I suppose
<EmmettBrown> Ooh,and here is a picture of some moonrock
<ValtheJean> I definitely like that idea
<Shiggy> DAT SAVE
<SirSprinkles> 6I suppose we can just make it Ponyville.
<GamerGodJones> I have epic spelling yo
<RainBroDash> 10if only to say 'let's go to the RD' room
<prince-dari> Even if people don't talk, it's nice to be sort of connected to them, if you know what I mean
<ValtheJean> especially considering we're going to be dealing with massive numbers
<herospirit> I don't remember that in the Bible :0
<prince-dari> (INB4 you don't and think I'm an idiot)
<EmmettBrown> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VAMC_Goodwill_lunar_sample.jpg
<DuskShine> Pouty Dash.
<RainBroDash> 10I'd call it just BronyState or BronyStateGeneral :3
<RobotPinkie> I love all of the Mane 6 though... just in different ways
<GabeMoist> magic tiara
<RainBroDash> 10I completely agree dari
<GamerGodJones> Broken jpg FTW
<Shiggy> YOUMADBRO?
<RainBroDash> 10otherwise I'd be in all rooms anyway
<Combustiblelemons> rarity is mad.
<SirSprinkles> 6RainBro, we're trying to keep them all Pony related...
<SirSprinkles> 6So Ponyville would be good.
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/VAMC_Goodwill_lunar_sample.jpg
<herospirit> No "COME OUT" spam?
<GGgala> herospirit: you read Genesis?
<PrincePOLO> nope
<ThePretender> WOOHOO
<prince-dari> If we get the domain I could probably have everything running by the end of tomorrow.
<interior_gummy> COME OUT
<Combustiblelemons> nope.
<Nightshade> awwwwwwwwwww yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<DuskShine> I'm surprised too, herospirit.
<zuggman> bad touch
<herospirit> yarp :0
<Silverscreen> 11Ponyville
<RainBroDash> 10I know, but I was just giving my opinion
<EmmettBrown> there we go
<PacGamer> oh man
<ponywithafez> YAY!
<Combustiblelemons> YEAAAAAA
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/980bdc42ef8e567e945cbb756fb22fe1/23152%20-%20Octavia%20hugs.png
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll do the domain when we're done with the meeting, dari.
<Combustiblelemons> my favourite ^_^
<DecapKing> Octavia wants hugs
<DuskShine> Human Applejack silhouette.
<GamerGodJones> So when can we do requests?
<Luna> 07everything...
<Luna> 07wow
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, as for the Brony Show partnership.
<EmmettBrown> The moon is the home of the clangers
<ThePretender> Winter wrap up, winter wrap!
<interior_gummy> when sprinkles gets bored
<prince-dari> Also, shall we have a help channel?
<SirSprinkles> 6We will, dari.
<Riders> We've actually gotten sick of Come OUT! spam. Jesus, we need season 2 badly.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's Derpy Hooves.
<Combustiblelemons> >inb4 seth hates dr whoof.
<PrincePOLO> Dumb mosquitos!
<sotha> GGgala: Could it have anything to do with addblocker?
<SirSprinkles> 6-_-;
<Silverscreen> 11So: Pony Theme Tab, A tab with Rooms and "Traffic lights", and a mane room.
<Luna> 07:D
<GabeMoist> RANDOM MOON TRIVIA: The Moon is made of cheese
<Aponymous> Lunar Shadow update? I'M IN!
<sotha> *adblocker
<GamerGodJones> 10 bucks says sprinkles has some form of ADD
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<herospirit> YO BITCHES LAY DOWN A BEAT. It's time for the Winter RAP up!
<interior_gummy> yay spam is the only fulfilling one
<Silverscreen> 11Nopony can be in more than one room at a time.
<herospirit> "toot" is fairly fulfilling
<SirSprinkles> 6The rooms and lights won't be in a tab, Silver.
<FreezeFrame> Seth derped the link to part 4
<Combustiblelemons> you can only watch season 1 so many times before it stagnates
<interior_gummy> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN BBBEEEEEYYYY-EEEETCCH
<SirSprinkles> 6They'll be under the stream and chat.
<Combustiblelemons> will bronystate do a showing of s2?
<EmmettBrown> There are currently three sources of Moon rocks on Earth: 1) those collected by US Apollo missions; 2) samples returned by the Soviet Union Luna missions; and 3) rocks that were ejected naturally from the lunar surface by cratering events and subsequently fell to Earth as lunar meteorites.
<Silverscreen> 11oh
<Silverscreen> 11okay
<Shiggy> YO I AM RAPPING, BECAUSE IM COOL, IM GOING TO GO JUMP IN A POOL
<Pinkie_Pie> OMG
<desertman2> yes, and it will be live
<Pinkie_Pie> 666 most popular deviations of all time for pinkamena [cancel]
<RobotPinkie> Live stream, Combustiblelemons
<EmmettBrown> Aren't rocks interesting?
<Pinkie_Pie> On deviant art, 666 results for "Pinkamena"
<GamerGodJones> SCREEN CAP THAT SHIT PINKIE
<prince-dari> Wait wut, rooms will be under the chat?
<ThePretender> O.o
<Elky> ugh, can't stay awake for requests
<Combustiblelemons> that is epic robotpinkie
<interior_gummy> god, i'm sick of pinkamena fanart
<DecapKing> i dont see whats wrong with 666
<Elky> good night.
<SirSprinkles> 6The lights will be.
<Combustiblelemons> I can't wait ^_^
<GGgala> sotha: dunno. i use Adblock extension in Chrome, doesn't stop Mibbit chat from working. same with Adblock Plus in Firefox...
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Combustiblelemons> night elky
<DecapKing> Luna whats wrong with 666?
<RobotPinkie> Me neither
<Silverscreen> 11Each theme has a banner that Wrek is designing, and all pages have an overhead banner that we're going to commission Mad Max to do.
<RobotPinkie> night Elky
<GGgala> sotha: but you use a Chrome derivative?
<prince-dari> Just you said rooms and lights, so I got confused.
<SirSprinkles> 6So we can have everything on one page.
<GamerGodJones> 666 is the number of the Beast
<Nittany_Tiger> It's the mark of the beast.
<FreezeFrame> DecapKing: From The Revelation of John, it's the number of the name of the Beast
<DecapKing> yeah so?
<EmmettBrown> It's the mythical number of the devil
<ThePretender> like that song from iron maiden
<RobotPinkie> I'm bored of Pony vs Pony now...
<SirSprinkles> 6Silver, those banners are for the rooms.
<sotha> GGgala: Yes, though I've had no problems with it before.
<Pinkie_Pie> How do I screen cap?
<Combustiblelemons> 666 is my lucky number.
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<DecapKing> i still dont see any problem with it
<SirSprinkles> 6The ones Wrek is designing.
<FreezeFrame> Although there's still a debate whether it's 666 or 616
<Nittany_Tiger> It's a number The Antichrist will use to mark people loyal to him.
<Combustiblelemons> I won a raffle with the ticket 666 :P
<DecapKing> hell thats the number thats on the bottom of my foot
<SirSprinkles> 6And the themes won't be made for a bit, so don't worry about that for now, dari.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<ThePretender> 616 is the universe number of mainstream Marvel comics
<Silverscreen> 11k
<EmmettBrown> A new mineral found on the Moon, armalcolite, was named for the three astronauts on the Apollo 11 mission: Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.
<DecapKing> its actually a birthmark
<GabeMoist> DecapKing is the Antichrist
<ThePretender> OH MAN, DAT 80's metal
<herospirit> 613 I mean. I think
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, the Brony Show partnership.
<PrincePOLO> 666 is 666 backwards
<GamerGodJones> My technology classroom's # is 404
<Shiggy> DUBSTEP REMIX
<ddddd> Hello? sotha ?
<Shiggy> WUBWUBWUB
<Luna> 07yes, that's new to me
<ponywithafez> BUFFER SAVE US!
<interior_gummy> dumb fabric
<PrincePOLO> WUBUBUBUBUBUB WUBWUBWUB
<Luna> 07do tell
<Nittany_Tiger> EmmettBrown sure loves the moon. Someone should banish him there.
<sotha> GGgala: Well, the chat works in IE. That was me as ddddd
<GamerGodJones> WUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUWBWUBWUBWUBWUWBUWBUWB
<Aponymous> I'm gonna go, later everyone.
<SirSprinkles> 6I talk with Circuit Mane fairly frequently, and it was agreed quite a while ago that we would partner when we moved to our own domain.
<Combustiblelemons> the original version of this was supposed to be epic
<Riders> Trivia: Unlike her idol, Scootaloo is not a very good singer
<ThePretender> I hope Hasbro releases the "good singing" version of this song
<prince-dari> Should we have an affiliates page?
<DuskShine> Ciao, Aponymous!
<EmmettBrown> HOLY CRAP GUYS
<PrincePOLO> actually I've never listened to this whole song
<DuskShine> Love ya!
<Combustiblelemons> but they had to make it horrible
<SirSprinkles> 6I will be making a partners page.
<Shiggy> did you guys know that santa is satan spelled backwards?
<ThePretender> later, Aponymous
<EmmettBrown> THERE@S A SPIDER RIGHT NEXT TO ME
<Nittany_Tiger> My middle school ID# was 7.
<sotha> GGgala: Er. . . I can see the viewer list in IE, but not the chat itself, though I can contribute to it.
<Combustiblelemons> i'd love to hear the original cmc song
<SirSprinkles> 6Affilliates sounds beter, actually...
<ThePretender> same
<PacGamer> ThePretender, what are you saying? their singing is great!
<Wrek> 05so with the new arrangements, ill still mkae the banners? coolio
<GamerGodJones> Shiggy, satan backwards is natas
<Combustiblelemons> DAVID INGRIM, Y U NO LET US HEAR IT.
<FreezeFrame> There's various theories, like in Hebrew eschatology 6 being the number of man, and traditionally if you say a thing three times it's true (hence the importance of Peter's denial of Jesus 3 times before the rooster crowed).
<herospirit> Shiggy: Lolwut
<Shiggy> no
<PrincePOLO> It would be nice but chicken screwed up
<prince-dari> Wrek can help with site themes as well. ;P
<Shiggy> its definitely right
<ThePretender> ...true, PacGamer, but in that cheesy 80's way
<Shiggy> you
<FreezeFrame> Hence 666 being an insistence that "yes, I am a human, not some horrific hellspawn"
<GGgala> sotha: are you using the SRware browser in the laptop that's working, too?
<EmmettBrown> Ponies Ponies Ponies
<SirSprinkles> 6Wrek, you'll be making the themes once the banners are done, but that's a future thing... as it'll be a project.
<RobotPinkie> Got a screencap of the 666 Pinkamena results.
<sotha> GGgala: Yes, though I think it is an older version.
<herospirit> Ponies Ponies Ponies
<EmmettBrown> Equestria Equestria Equestria
<SirSprinkles> 6I've thought a lot of this out... =/
<herospirit> COME ON GUYS MAKE IT TRUE
<GabeMoist> PONIES ARE REAL
<GabeMoist> PONIES ARE REAL
<EmmettBrown> Well,that doesn't work
<GabeMoist> PONIES ARE REAL
<GamerGodJones> Their suits make them look like pokemon
<SirSprinkles> 6*scrolls through chat* There was one other thing somepony mentioned...
<prince-dari> I forgot what our outcome was of the earlier discussion, are we having an event on Monday/Tuesday or not?
<RobotPinkie> Too bad it's actually 616 that's the number of the beast :(
<herospirit> PONIES ARE REAL PONIES ARE REAL PONIES ARE REAL
<FreezeFrame> Pinkie: eschatology is cool
<Combustiblelemons> yes they are.
<Wrek> 05i feel like twilight pulling of the flight spell
<ThePretender> MAAAARVEEEELLLLL
<ValtheJean> depends on if we can contact gggala or sumica
<EmmettBrown> My rubiks cube is solved
<RainBroDash> 10i mentioned the teams/mods/admins :P
<herospirit> We need more WISHING power!
<Shiggy> "real ponies are real
<EmmettBrown> My rubiks cube is solved
<ValtheJean> (and any other s2 streamer I may have forgotten
<Combustiblelemons> they live in fields and have a low intelligence.
<EmmettBrown> My Rubiks cube is solved
<SirSprinkles> 6That was it, RainBro.
<Nittany_Tiger> Cool.
<Luna> 07I also have a thing
<EmmettBrown> Nope,still doesn't work
<GamerGodJones> GUISE DID YOU KNOW YOU AER WATCHING PONIES IN A STREAM?
<RobotPinkie> Indeed
<prince-dari> >points at question
<solthas> GGgala: It seems that in IE on the desktop, the add at the top of the chat box is blocking me from seeing what the tab says. . .
<SirSprinkles> 6It's (tentatively) for Thursday, dari.
<RobotPinkie> TIME TO GO TO BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
<prince-dari> And we're doing what, a pony marathon?
<SirSprinkles> 6We need to talk to the streamers.
*RobotPinkie falls asleep
<ValtheJean> live TV stream
<Combustiblelemons> sweetie belle is the queen of soul.
<prince-dari> Oh I remember.
<ValtheJean> of the Hub and other things
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll be a live TV stream.
<prince-dari> My memory is dead.
<prince-dari> Yeah, I liked that idea.
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, the teams/mods/admins thing.
<GamerGodJones> You should watch SO MANY F*CKING WONDERS
<Combustiblelemons> flutterguy should do a duet.
<DecapKing> i have this song on my pc o.o
<SirSprinkles> 6It's purely for the sake of organization, for one.
<Combustiblelemons> buffer returns.
<DuskShine> If Sweetie Belle is the Queen of Soul, does that make Scootaloo the Queen of Hair Metal?
<SirSprinkles> 6Since piling all these people in one place would be HELL.
<ThePretender> Yes
<ThePretender> yes it does
<GamerGodJones> Then whats applebloom?
<Luna> 07hugs RB
<GGgala> solthas: huh. have you considered just using an IRC client?
<Luna> 07RP*
<EmmettBrown> Near the end of the third and final moonwalk and what would be the last moonwalk of the Apollo program, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt picked up a rock (later labeled sample 70017)
<ThePretender> queen of country
<herospirit> SPACE IS INVISIBLE MIND DUST. AND STARS ARE BUT WISHEEES! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrfIkQ_we7A
<RainBroDash> 10ok, so what is an admin, what is a mod, and do we have any preliminary ideas for splitting into groups?
<Combustiblelemons> >inb4 space.
<EmmettBrown> and made a special dedication to the young people of Earth and "picked up a very significant rock, typical of what we have here in the valley of Taurus-Littrow... composed of many fragments, of many sizes, and many shapes, probably from all parts of the Moon, perhaps billions of years old. "
<sotha> GGgala: doing what now?
<EmmettBrown> Then President Richard Nixon ordered the distribution of fragments of that rock to 135 foreign heads of state, the 50 U.S. states and its provinces. The fragments were presented encased in an acrylic sphere, mounted on a wood plaque which included the recipients flag which had also flown aboard Apollo 17.[
<SirSprinkles> 6The admins were basically decided when Hipster left and gave the reigns over to, and he mentioned names specifically, Ghosties, Sathi, and myself, as we were already doing most of the organizational stuff.
<DecapKing> Luna is the reason i dont get a hug cause 666 is on the bottom of my foot?
<SirSprinkles> 6The mods are well, chatroom mods.
<EmmettBrown> Most of these are on musieums but one is missing
<SirSprinkles> 6That don't have to worry heavily about the craziness of organization and day-to-day tasks.
<RainBroDash> 10oh what that fleeting sentence, yeah I can remember being a bit aggravated at the time not being mentioned, despite being here for so long >.>
<RobotPinkie> :O
<Octavia> 14Some of us don't get to be let into the more organizational stuff. :P
<GamerGodJones> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r509sR2TdFg&feature=related
<SirReginald> i took it
<EmmettBrown> Wiill you be the one t ofind it?
<RobotPinkie> ...am I hugged?
<Nittany_Tiger> We need to restart our moon program.
<herospirit> DECAP, DON'T WORRY! You just stepped in a very very inconvenient pile of dog shit! :D
<GGgala> sotha: #BronyState is just a channel on an IRC server, epic-chat.net. you can connect with mIRC or XChat, too. The embedded AJAX chat that isn't working for you is just for convenience.
<RainBroDash> 10I felt like hipster went 'oh yeah I'm leaving it all to sprinkles ghosties and sathi because they do all the work'
*Nightshade RobotPinkie
<Pinkie_Pie> I screencapped that image http://postimage.org/image/32g6g3gf8/
<Octavia> 14Aww
<ThePretender> agreed Nitanny_Tiger
<Nightshade> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6...RainBro, you're still fairly new, and Sathi was pretty much thrown in there because she does A LOT around here.
<Nightshade> im failing today
<ThePretender> gah, mispely
<Silverscreen> 11...
<ThePretender> noooo, I can't spell
<DecapKing> apparently you are RobotPinkie and im not
<herospirit> GamerGodJones: Is that guy gonna redo ALL the songs? XD
*Nightshade hugs RobotPinkie
<Nittany_Tiger> Only reason we're not going now is because we're broke and not in a race with anyone.
<herospirit> Because I hope so
*Octavia 14hugs RainBroDash
<DecapKing> also it isnt dog shit, its actually a birthmark
<RobotPinkie> Yay! I like hugs
<Dat_Pon-3> is something playing tonight?
<RainBroDash> 10>still fairly new. I'm a 'LOT' less new than the majority of our team. Not to mention being here for like 80% of the total runtime of BMN regularyl
<EmmettBrown> NASA has also made a number of educational packs comprising a disc of six small rock and soil samples in a lucite disc and a pack of thin petrological sections. They are available for exhibition and educational purposes in many countries, including Great Britain, where the samples are kept by the Science and Technology Facilities Counc
<RainBroDash> 10regularly*
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, it's nothing other than taking care of organizational day-to-day stuff.
<RainBroDash> 10but ok
<DuskShine> CASTLEVANIA BIRDS!
<EmmettBrown> il
<DuskShine> I heard it again!
<Nittany_Tiger> Apollo ran during The Vietnam war I think.
<GamerGodJones> i got booted out of chat, who asked me a question?
<prince-dari> Meh, I'm not bothered about not being included, opinions gunna opinionate. :P
<EmmettBrown> So much information about rocks
<SirSprinkles> 6Everyone still has the same amount of say on subjects as everyone else.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari... I just forgot to add you to the list. XD
<herospirit> I asked if that guy is going to re do all the songs
<SirSprinkles> 6Because you really should be.
<herospirit> Because I hope so.
<RobotPinkie> I think I really am going to bed though...
<Nittany_Tiger> Of course, that was one war, not two.
<EmmettBrown> Moon rocks fall into two main categories, the ones found in the lunar highlands (terrae) or the maria. The terrae consist dominantly of mafic plutonic rocks. Regolith breccias with similar protoliths are also common
<RainBroDash> 10well, hipster didn't add him to the list :P
<Octavia> 14I'm new. So... yeah. But I do have lots of experience in this in my older age.
<GamerGodJones> Yeah probably
<RobotPinkie> Night ponies, have a very pony night
<DecapKing> bye RobotPinkie
<GamerGodJones> ARHG i dont care about the moon
<Nittany_Tiger> Ok.
<ThePretender> later
<GamerGodJones> No offense tho
<Nightshade> bye RobotPinkie
<SirReginald> i love the moon
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster didn't add DCD either, but he's our mane streamer, so he's on the list.
<GamerGodJones> Oh right, bye robotpinkie
<EmmettBrown> Shush Gamer,you'll upset luna
*Nightshade gives goodbye hug to RobotPinkie
<Combustiblelemons> bye robotpinkie
<GamerGodJones> Luna is off the moon aint she?
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari's our code guy, so he deserves it with all the hell he goes through.
<SirReginald> Luuuna
<EmmettBrown> Still hers
<GamerGodJones> It doesnt apply to her anymore
<Combustiblelemons> maybe she got homesick?
<Luna> 07and he knows everything about streaming.. he's personally gonna train the new streamers
<DecapKing> the only things i care about on the moon are Luna, and the Space Core
<RainBroDash> 10I don't really get much chance to do anything important :L
<SirSprinkles> 6Wrek'll probably get put on the list if he keeps up the good work.
<ThePretender> what about moon zombies?
<GamerGodJones> I think the cheese is pretty good
<SirReginald> Well living there for 1000 years, probably means she paid off the mortgage.
<Combustiblelemons> I wonder what she did on the moon for 1000 years
<GamerGodJones> geddit, the moon is made out of cheese?
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly it's basically "do stuff, be important, get admin"
<RainBroDash> 10I've never not been enthusiastic about it :P
<Octavia> 14I know that feel RBD
<SirSprinkles> 6The more you try the further you'll go.
<ponywithafez> WOOT
<EmmettBrown> The "Cheese" would kill you if you ate it
<GamerGodJones> She knitted
<Combustiblelemons> she probably built a city maybe
<interior_gummy> bye robotpinkiw
<RainBroDash> 10meh, I've tried inordinately hard :L
<EmmettBrown> Like eating sand,but worse
<ThePretender> or a moon base!
<PrincePOLO> Sge obviously had a party with Space Core
<Octavia> 14Yeah... I wish we could just all be equals...
<RainBroDash> 10for like 3+ months ^^
<SirReginald> lol
<GamerGodJones> She posted ponies
<interior_gummy> so when are requests?
<Octavia> 14SOME of us dont get the chances to do more.
<EmmettBrown> More like eating little bits of glass actually
<SirSprinkles> 6...come up with ideas and whatnot.
<Combustiblelemons> 6 minutes gummy
<RainBroDash> 10I give input on a regular basis, just saying, like.
<interior_gummy> yehs
<GamerGodJones> I wonder what luna would be like under the effects of poison joke
<Combustiblelemons> that reminds me- hobo with a shotgun- anyone seen it?
<sotha> GGgala: So. . . I'm going to try something else.... rather than installing SRWare Iron anew on the new computer, I'll see about moving it from the laptop?
<Octavia> 14I have. But people either shoot them down or ignore them. I was told to forget about helping with the site. Can't stream until after I move. No help needed with the forums. Not sure what else there is...
<Combustiblelemons> hobo with a shotgun is epic.
<Combustiblelemons> really, really gory though.

<EmmettBrown> ###then,after shredding your digestive system it would mix with the bile and stuff in your stomach to form liquid cement,drowning you
<SirSprinkles> 6You were told to forget about helping with the mane site?
<GamerGodJones> I think Gay Niggers From Outer Space is better
<ThePretender> reanimator gory?
<SirSprinkles> 6By whom?
<Octavia> 14I can't remember now.
<RainBroDash> 10I don't really care that much, it just got on my tits when hipster said it but I felt like he didn't like me that much anyway. But now it does feel like my input is exclusively ignored :L
<Combustiblelemons> reanimator gory
<Octavia> 14It was near the beginning of when I joined.
*ThePretender whistles in surprise
<Nittany_Tiger> Quite gory.
<EmmettBrown> Plus you could get your mouth near it anyway,you're wearing a space suit
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh
<SirSprinkles> 6Nopony's input is ignored.
<RainBroDash> 10after it being confirmed by more than one of you 'core important mods'
<Nittany_Tiger> Nvm.
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't seen that other movie.
<Octavia> 14I just wish we could all be equals. Right now it almost feels like a game of who's the best and who's the favorites.
<GamerGodJones> That comment emmettbrown, that made me hungry
<EmmettBrown> Anyway,more trivia about the moon
<RainBroDash> 10So I've not put in enough input?
<Combustiblelemons> it's pretty epic, a homeless man fights back in a corrupt, crime infested city
<SirSprinkles> 6We all ARE equals. Everypony's say matters just as equally as everypony else's.
<ThePretender> speaking of moons and movies, anyone going to see Apollo 18?
<PrincePOLO> ib4 20% cooler
<SirReginald> Aand there it is.
<Luna> 07exactly
<Octavia> 14I spose.
<RainBroDash> 10I'm just puzzled, to a humongous extent
<GamerGodJones> wow, no 20% cooler turbochat?
<SirSprinkles> 6About what, RainBro?
<ThePretender> I'm surprised myself
<SirReginald> tuuuuurrrrbbooooo
<Combustiblelemons> budget? it's free D:
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh, it's the post show plus not too many people online right now
<RainBroDash> 10about why nopony seems to think I do anything around here
<Silverscreen> Private video.
<GamerGodJones> I havnt seen turbochat in a while actually
<Dat_Pon-3> wow no 1spammed 20% cooler
<Octavia> 14But when you assign special labels like "admin" and "mod", its the general consensus that admins are the bosses over mods. And it can make some feel less important.
<GamerGodJones> Not even last night
<RainBroDash> 10>nopony
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<SirSprinkles> 6I think no such thing.
<EmmettBrown> Her's a picture of all the different land marks on the side of the moon you can see
<Nittany_Tiger> Looks like Apollo 18 will assume that the Soviets did get to the moon with their LK lander.
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Moon_names.svg
<sotha> inb4 Sotha has no idea what she's doing.
<Shiggy> loloolololololoooolloollololoololo
<RainBroDash> 10then why am I a lesser moderator?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 plus, I like it when there's no spam :P
<Combustiblelemons> we're better people than that
<SirSprinkles> 6You do a wonderful job of watching the chat.
<GamerGodJones> LMAO
<Dat_Pon-3> i see what you did thar pinkie
*ThePretender reminisces back to last week's epic LOTR chats
<PrincePOLO> lol
<GamerGodJones> Yeah but i miss my good friend TUrbochat
<Combustiblelemons> XD I knew someone would do that.
<SirSprinkles> 6Because you haven't expressed interest to help in day-to-day organization.
<DuskShine> Oh jeez, this video.
<SirSprinkles> 6That I know of.
<RainBroDash> 10well I have
<Nittany_Tiger> And fixed their N1 rocket.
<RainBroDash> 10there you go
*DuskShine saw it coming, still loves it.
<GamerGodJones> ohai octavia, again
<Combustiblelemons> snails is a genious.
<prince-dari> I think I'm in agreement with Octavia.
<Dat_Pon-3> how does she play chords with whooves
*Silverscreen 11is just here.
<Dat_Pon-3> magic
<DuskShine> Very well.
<EmmettBrown> Because of the Moon's lack of water, an atmosphere, or tectonic plates, there is little erosion, and craters are found that exceed two billion years in age. The age of large craters is determined by the number of smaller craters contained within it, older craters generally accumulating more small, contained craters.
<Shiggy> carefully
<PrincePOLO> ok it's 2:00 I'm going to bed
<RainBroDash> 10I'm in a partial agreement, but that's probably emotional bias
<EmmettBrown> Craterception
<prince-dari> I don't think it's really helping us work together.
<DuskShine> She plays them very well and very carefully.
<GamerGodJones> Its 8:pm over here
<GamerGodJones> uh, PM
<Dat_Pon-3> its 7 pm here
<DuskShine> . . .
<DuskShine> More Midnight stuff. =/
<Luna> 07Actually there's a way to become involved.. some channels are not being used at the moment
<Combustiblelemons> a crater within a crater?
<Combustiblelemons> we need to go deeper...
<Luna> 07for instance : Twitter & Facebook
<Octavia> 14It just makes some of us feel less important or like we're not helpful enough. When we want to be more involved in the first place.
<eat911> Craterception
<Dat_Pon-3> i got a question everypony just wondering
<EmmettBrown> Craters typically will have some or all of the following features:
<GamerGodJones> WHats the question?
<Octavia> 14I dont use either, but I can maintain them if thats whats needed.
<RainBroDash> 10Well I've asked if there is stuff to do before, but nobody said that 3 months ago xD
<EmmettBrown> a surrounding area with materials splashed out of the ground when the crater was formed; this is typically lighter in shade than older materials due to exposure to solar radiation for a lesser time
<ValtheJean> well, I'll happily do anything Twitter/Facebook related if there's something that needs done
<Octavia> 14Me too :P
<Combustiblelemons> it's 1:00 AM here. request tiem?
<EmmettBrown> a raised rim, consisting of materials ejected but landing very close by
<Dat_Pon-3> What "one shot" character would you like to see return in season 2 any character that was like in only one episode?
<ThePretender> Trixie or Octavia
<GamerGodJones> Trixie
<EmmettBrown> crater wall, the downward-sloping portion of the crater
<GamerGodJones> Wtf?
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know.
<EmmettBrown> crater floor, a more or less smooth, flat area, which as it ages accumulates small craters of its own
*DuskShine loves this.
<Combustiblelemons> lolwut.
<EmmettBrown> central peak, found only in some craters with a diameter exceeding 16 miles (26 km); this is generally a splash effect caused by the kinetic energy of the impacting object being turned to heat and melting some lunar material.
<GamerGodJones> WHAT IS THIS SONG
<GamerGodJones> I HAVE HERD IT B4
<Octavia> 14But I'm really new here, which is why I've not voiced this concern yet. I honestly don't have a ton of right to complain. But figured since we're getting some things out in the open. Just saying.
<Dat_Pon-3> Trixie, Photo Finish, DJ PON-3, for me i guess
<Combustiblelemons> polka
<ThePretender> this is catchy
<Octavia> 14Labels can always over-complicate things.
<EmmettBrown> And thats all the features of a crater
<GamerGodJones> i LOST BRIAN CELLS
<GGgala> Equestria Fuck yeah!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the video (I believe) is called My Little Pony: Polka is Magic btwe
<Combustiblelemons> their front hooves don't move!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 btw*
<PacGamer> omg this song
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<GamerGodJones> BEST SINGING EVAR
<Octavia> 14But so you know, some of us want to be more involved if anything is needed. I'd be working with DCD to stream well right now if I wasnt in the middle of a move. Or like Wrek and host a server.
<Combustiblelemons> EQUESTRIUHHH
<EmmettBrown> The smallest craters found have been microscopic in size, found in rocks returned to Earth from the Moon. The largest crater called such is about 360 kilometers (200 miles) in diameter, located near the lunar South Pole. However, it is believed that many of the lunar maria were formed by giant impacts, with the resulting depression filled by upwelling lava.
<ThePretender> this song makes me feel MANLIER
<GamerGodJones> ITS EVEN BETTER THAN KAREOKE
*Silverscreen 11sighs.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm out of here
<RainBroDash> 10cya silverscreen :3
<EmmettBrown> Amazing how many facts there are about the moon
<Octavia> 14Don't be like that Silver.
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/908991bca9016ee7e8d07a398c250083/724%20-%20Clueless_Was_Here%20Snails%20blood%20gun%20running%20snips%20vietnam.jpg
<RainBroDash> 10silver's gone xD
<prince-dari> He's gone.
<Dat_Pon-3> MetalShy
<Octavia> 14Ah phooey.
<DecapKing> Luna, FRIENDSHIP!
<Octavia> 14It's best to sort out any issues anyway though.
<Luna> 07Indeed it is
<Combustiblelemons> OHGODG3
<GamerGodJones> HAPPU WHAT NOW?
<Octavia> 14Before they have time to build up to bigger ones.
<Barry> Hi
<Combustiblelemons> the forbidden season.
<Synros> ello everyone
<Barry> Hi Synros
<GamerGodJones> Sup broski
<EmmettBrown> The best thing is there is a whole category related to the moon,and I haven't even got half way through it yet
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh hell yes
<Octavia> 14But I'm just stating for all us here who aren't more involved, that doesn't mean we don't want to be.
<GamerGodJones> oh dear lord
*ValtheJean 2,14 dances
<GamerGodJones> carameldansen
<Combustiblelemons> This.
<RainBroDash> 10^
<Bjornfot> OH GOD CARAMELLDANSEN
<Dat_Pon-3> looks weird
<ThePretender> PROFOUND SADNESS
<Bjornfot> SWEDEN FUCK YEAH
<Luna> 07I'm glad you guys want to become more involved!
<Combustiblelemons> 1 thing I hate- their legs are F*cked up.
<DecapKing> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<RainBroDash> 10I've tried streaming, I've been gaming with the active viewers for weeks
<Combustiblelemons> UMAD decapking?
<Octavia> 14I'd love to be more involved somehow.
<Bjornfot> THIS IS THE SONG OF MY PEOPLE
<Ramirez> *hear my own language, shoot self*
<RainBroDash> 10just saying, lack of recognition mixed with this new lables stuff is just a bit of a combo-owie
<Octavia> 14After I move I'll have a better speed, so I may be able to stream if I can understand it all.
<GamerGodJones> WHATS ALL THIS RACKET UP HERE SON?!
<Octavia> 14I agree.
<EmmettBrown> The moon is used to measure how long a month is
<Combustiblelemons> True story: I was climbing a mountain and this song randomly came into my head.
<ThePretender> BRIAN MAY WHY ARE YOU PERFROMING WItH LADY GAGA
<GamerGodJones> YOU WATCHEN YOUR GAY JAPANANEASE STUFF AGAIN?
<Barry> Pinkie I'd understand dancing to this song, but Rainbow Dash?!
<Luna> 07it's just we needed some kind of organization to deal with the various things
<Luna> 07S2 is coming and we all have tons of stuff todo
<Combustiblelemons> tis not japanese ^_^
<GamerGodJones> Its not gay japanease stuff dad, its Carameldansen
<Octavia> 14I'm guessing it'll be too late to host a server or such like Wrek from my computer after I move however.
<GamerGodJones> Here watch for a sec...
<Luna> 07for instance I could use a hand with the recruitment part
<Octavia> 14Its understandable Luna
<GamerGodJones> *DISAPROVEALFAIC*
<Combustiblelemons> catchy as hell.
<Octavia> 14How so exacly?
<Octavia> 14*exactly
<Shiggy> WHAT IN THE FACK IS THIS
<ValtheJean> Well I'll happily offer myself for whatever needs doing
<GamerGodJones> THIS, IS, CARAMELDANSEN
<RainBroDash> 10it's just a bit annoying that this wasn't said weeks ago, so I could have used my free time more effectively
<Combustiblelemons> tis carameldansen with cellulite ponies.
<EmmettBrown> Moonlight is the light that reaches Earth from the Moon. This light does not originate from the Moon, but from sunlight. The Moon does not, however, reflect sunlight like a mirror, but it reflects light from those portions of its surface which the Sun's light strikes
<SirSprinkles> 6We really have a TON of day-to-day stuff that goes on... and we handle it every day, and have been, even since before Hipster left.
<Luna> 07indeed
<ThePretender> how long is this? @_@
<EmmettBrown> SO MANY FACTS
<RainBroDash> 10Sprinkles I do know
<Octavia> 14We know this.
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/2de499db2d9e4a8f691d9a289853fe06/725%20-%20Clueless_Was_Here%20adult%20gun%20rarity%20spike%20vietnam.jpg
<Ramirez> dansa med oss, klappa era händer. gör som vi gör, ta några steg åt vänster...
<Combustiblelemons> 3 minutes if i were to guess
<RainBroDash> 10I read the whole skype chat every single time I get up, and I comment on it
<GamerGodJones> What is this place, filled with so many moon facts
<Barry> and according to one anime, adds an entirely new wavelength of energy in the process
<EmmettBrown> I'M DROWNING IN FACTS ABOUT THE MOON
<SirSprinkles> 6RainBro... it kinda has been mentioned a few times that we need people to run facebook/twitter
<typjk> yay 90s
<Combustiblelemons> Alex S. (feat. Ghost) - Melting Pot of Alcohol play this
<Combustiblelemons> oh okay.
<GamerGodJones> RUNNING IN THE 90'S
<Combustiblelemons> I'm fine with this.
<ThePretender> DAT INITIAL D
<DecapKing> that was Ear Rape to me
<RainBroDash> 10not that I've noticed, my bad. And yeah that's not exactly much of a difficult task, just give me the login -> done
<Combustiblelemons> ahh the 90s, good time.
<GamerGodJones> I was born then :D
<EmmettBrown> Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth.
<Luna> 07the newsletter needs a better look
<SirSprinkles> 6Do you have mod yet on the facebook?
<Luna> 07more frequent contact with candidates
<EmmettBrown> LUNA CONTROLS THE SEA
<Wrek> 05i have a question or two that i'd like to ask once subject change occurs
<Luna> 07sure
<Barry> yes, but destroy the moon, and everything goes out of control for a few years
<Combustiblelemons> also, the ground rises and falls due to this tidal stress.
<EmmettBrown> LUNA CONTROLS EVERYTINHG
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/468c544aca3d78c976827619adc907b0/22592%20-%20gun%20vietnam%20war%20zebra%20zecora.jpg
<GamerGodJones> If celestia and luna controll sun and moon, who controlls the rotating of the galaxy around the supermassave black hole in the center of the universe?
<Nittany_Tiger> The moon also regulates the rotation rate and spin axis of the earth.
<EmmettBrown> BLOW UP THE MOON AND MAKE A NEW ONE
<Suffuri> i'll be on laterish
<Suffuri> didnt the movie just start?
<RainBroDash> 10no sirsprinkles, I can sort that in a minute if you want

<GamerGodJones> every friday for americans
<Nittany_Tiger> Vinyl Scratch is one one-time character I would like to see come back.
<Suffuri> merica
<Barry> The moon refracts the sun's light, and according to some, adds an entirely new wavelength to it, which affects those sensitive to it
<EmmettBrown> The South Pole-Aitken basin is an impact crater on Earth's Moon. Roughly 2500 kilometers in diameter and 13 kilometers deep, it is one of the largest known impact craters in the entire Solar System. It is the largest, oldest and deepest basin recognized on the Moon.
<Combustiblelemons> friday for americans and the insomniacs.
<applebloommare> hi everypony :)
<GamerGodJones> AHMURIKAH

<Combustiblelemons> I don't see the resemblance suffuri
<Suffuri> or maybe a Halo helmet... hrmm

<GamerGodJones> She could defenitally use a helmet
<GamerGodJones> couldnt hurt
<Suffuri> yeah one of the Spartan helmets
<EmmettBrown> The moon has the biggest crater in the solar system
<Nittany_Tiger> What's with the MLP: Vietnam images?
<Combustiblelemons> helmets are for scootaloo.
<ThePretender> expansion pack season
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/908991bca9016ee7e8d07a398c250083/724%20-%20Clueless_Was_Here%20Snails%20blood%20gun%20running%20snips%20vietnam.jpg
<GamerGodJones> I dunno, decap just keeps posting them
<Suffuri> hope i didn't miss flutter
<DecapKing> no reason
<SirSprinkles> 6Wouldn't exactly be hard, just join the group and give me the name to give mod.
<DecapKing> just bored
<herospirit> O_O
<Nittany_Tiger> Snips and Snails actually look cool in those drawings.
<Combustiblelemons> buffer!
<RainBroDash> 10yeah, just sorting it now
<Barry1> You missed everything. We're on the post-show
<DuskShine> Lots of buffering in this stream.
<RainBroDash> 10atm I just lurk on it with my main account
<Combustiblelemons> twas continuing lol
<applebloommare> lol
<EmmettBrown> I made is a colourful new moon
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Aitken_Kagu_big.jpg
<applebloommare> I'll say
<GamerGodJones> I think the streamer died, and this is just on autoplay
<SirSprinkles> 6As for twitter, I need to go through my folder to find the list of passwords for things real quick...
<ThePretender> well, I think I'm out for tonight
<ThePretender> later, everyone
<RainBroDash> 10just made a ponies account: ponies on fb + starting new Uni with people stalking my facebook before they know me = instant lose
<sotha> GGgala: It is the same with firefox, just so you know.
<applebloommare> later ^^
<GamerGodJones> Goodbye pretender
<Combustiblelemons> bye pretender
<Nittany_Tiger> Emmett, that's a false-color image of the moon to show height. :p
<SirSprinkles> 6Be careful.
<Barry1> what's this?
<SirSprinkles> 6Facebook might delete it.
<applebloommare> bye pretender ^^
<EmmettBrown> I should do more facts about space bodies
<EmmettBrown> I made it
<Combustiblelemons> the titles right in front of you barry.
<RainBroDash> 10I'm cool with that. It'll take another similar 3 seconds to make a smurf account instead
<EmmettBrown> Its a sonic rainmoon

<ValtheJean> pretty much at one point or another facebook WILL delete it
<DuskShine> ... this song!
<Barry1> I couldn't read it
*Charles mewls softly
<RainBroDash> 10in fact I already have a few, just need to open the notepad file with the info anyway
<DuskShine> Castlevania Birds!
<Barry1> It was too broken up
<Combustiblelemons> emmett: rainbow dash approves of that moon
*DuskShine can't remember the real name of the song.
<Combustiblelemons> i cant remember this one either
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/5c81eaadc5c9f0d0f159cf07f0628cc7/721%20-%20Clueless_Was_Here%20gilda%20vietnam.jpg
<RainBroDash> 10but I'll start with this, it's better if this did happen to work in the long run
<Luna> 07also some ideas on the newsletter would be great
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/xT5rG4
<Luna> 07the forum is pretty much the place where everything happends
<EmmettBrown> Right guys,I'm bored of the moon,lets do something else
<Luna> 07+ skype..
<GamerGodJones> How aboot the sun?
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/d72ccf5bb04dc6cb82cb7184a4a7ecdc/720%20-%20Clueless_Was_Here%20fluttershy%20vietnam.jpg
<Wrek> 05didnt even know we hadn one to be honest
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Uranus2.jpg
<Combustiblelemons> how much effort goes into these
<EmmettBrown> That is Uranus
<Luna> 07had what?
<Barry1> That looks like neptune
<Wrek> 05a nweletr
<Octavia> 14Newsletter
<GamerGodJones> HEH HEH HEH, Uranus
<ValtheJean> well, we could consider putting a little Bronystate signature in the email, make it more official
<Luna> 07we do
<Wrek> 05whoa
<Barry1> There's no rings
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to make a list on the forums of all the places we have groups and whatnot...
<Wrek> 05that typign failed
<Roan> Uh, is it post show right now?
<RainBroDash> 10yeah the only one I don't read frequently is the forums
<SirSprinkles> 6There already is, Val.
<Combustiblelemons> neptune is a darker blue
<Combustiblelemons> and has storms on it
<Barry1> and Uranus has rings
<ValtheJean> an imaged signature?
<RainBroDash> 10frequently enough*
<Luna> 07there's a ton of things to pick up and manage
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, imaged?
<EmmettBrown> Instead of rotating like a spinning top,Uranus rotates like a rolling ball
<SirSprinkles> 6That would look nice.
<Roan> Seriously what's going on right now?
<ValtheJean> well if you wanted I could start working on one
<Nittany_Tiger> Uh oh.
<Combustiblelemons> the afterparty.
<AllisZero> Nothing
<EmmettBrown> Nope,I got that off the Uranus wikipeida page
<sotha> GGgala: It is the same with Google Chrome, too! I'm starting to think it isn't my browser. . .
<AllisZero> Pretty much
<Barry1> Combustiblelemons: Neptune may gey rings in the future
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/3e6a0986a539a967e6a2d426a1505b3a/719%20-%20Clueless_Was_Here%20derpy_hooves%20gun%20vietnam.jpg
<DuskShine> F-Zero!
<Octavia> 14Yeah, same here. I just don't know what specifically needs done.
<Combustiblelemons> due to triton I know yes
<Luna> 07a new layout ?
<Octavia> 14For the site?
<Combustiblelemons> my head is full of 2 things: space facts and pony.
*DuskShine still thinks somebody should take the clip of Scootaloo on her scooter from Show Stoppers and set it to Sounds of Big Blue from F-Zero GX.
<Combustiblelemons> and theoretical physics.
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/754f33b26031575936f1c58a9fac8986/718%20-%20Clueless_Was_Here%20big_macintosh%20cigarette%20gun%20m2_browning%20minigun%20smoking%20vietnam.jpg

<interior_gummy> where's the request stream?
<Barry1> Spoiler: The people who make these have too much time on their hands
<Combustiblelemons> Rainbow dash guitar game anyone?

<Combustiblelemons> http://distoorted.livejournal.com/9356.html
<Barry1> ah
<Luna> 07like I said before.. take a look at the forum..
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Uranus2.jpg uranus
<EmmettBrown> SE THE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCES
<Barry1> I was confused because of the lack of rings
<Combustiblelemons> told ya barry
<mib_ftkbft> might i ask, wth is dis?
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/696cc871f601ac53bf4195a603b83324/717%20-%20Clueless_Was_Here%20applejack%20vietnam.jpg
<mib_ftkbft> i leave and this is on
<Nittany_Tiger> Jupiter has an unusually strong magnetic field and weather that's more active than it should be. Saturn's and Neptune's weather are also unusually active for their solar placement.
<DecapKing> well im out of MLP Vietnam pics
<EmmettBrown> ONE IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SHADE OFBLUE
<herospirit> WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT SPACE?
<Octavia> 14I have, but I didn't see a specific list, unless I missed something.
<RainBroDash> 10which specific part of the forum are you pointing at?
<EmmettBrown> Its funny
<applebloommare> because space is THAT awesome XD
<EmmettBrown> RAAAAAAGE
<Barry1> Nyan Dash
<DuskShine> Nice remix.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's believed that internal heating is making up for the lack of solar heating proving the driving forces for the atmospheric phenomena on those gas giants.
<Ramirez> nyan, now 20% cooler
<Combustiblelemons> oh god.
<Roan> Damn, I missed Re-animator . . . Was it the fandirected sequel or the original?
<Dermathil> dat dash looks fugly
<herospirit> SPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Combustiblelemons> it looks g3/
<Dermathil> ^^
<Nittany_Tiger> The original.
<herospirit> I accidentally the Dash's face
<Roan> Okay.
<Barry1> It's a Rainbow Dash with a pop-tart body, who cares what gen it is!
<Nittany_Tiger> Someone on the forums has a better Nyan Dash.
<Luna> 07I named a few things: twitter / facebook / pr / recruitment
<RainBroDash> 10Like, if there's one section which I should read, which is it?
<EmmettBrown> Uranus has vitually no visible features from space
<Denied_Existence> Nyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyan
<Roan> I was wondering how you would get away with streaming the final scene of the sequel. It's . . . not kosher . . .
<RainBroDash> 10Because I read a lot of it, and it all just seems to be dotted around
<Luna> 07newsletter / ideas /
<Combustiblelemons> this is better: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIT6cEksqY&feature=related
<Luna> 07feedback /
<ValtheJean> Um...I don't see those sathi >.<
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying this isn't an old playlist
<EmmettBrown> It does spin like a ball instead of like a top like most other planets though
<Roan> Ti..
<Barry1> Yay, no pap-tart body
<SirSprinkles> 6lol didn't this play already?
<DuskShine> lolrandom
<Nittany_Tiger> You did.
<Barry1> Scientists suspect that's because of an impact early on
<Combustiblelemons> this played.
<Ziltoid> dem polka
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a playlist on shuffle. XD
<Combustiblelemons> more polka?
<Purple`Prose> Is Super Robot Night running tonight?
<Combustiblelemons> ohh right.
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Uranusandrings.jpg here is a false colour image
<Ziltoid> what is the original name of this song?
<Barry1> That definitely brings out the features
<Barry1> I forgot how faint Uranus' rings were
<EmmettBrown> As you can see,Uranus is screwed up
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/8ce01c525e0c36b4f7de1c5a4ad4cfb1/45588%20-%20artist%3AEgophiliac%20celestia%20featured_image%20filly%20luna%20ninja%20sisters%20will_cause_diabetes_and_various_heart_problems%20woona.png Luna is full of mischief
<Nittany_Tiger> Did you know that gas giants larger than Jupiter have been found to orbit their stars at strange locations relative to their parent star?
<Barry1> Like one as close as Mercury?
<herospirit> Luna is in your tail, plotting.
<Barry1> is to our sun?
<herospirit> WHAT IS THIS MUSIC FROM
<ValtheJean> are the threads your refering to viewable only to admins?
<Roan> Has unanimousdelivers done anything in the past few months?
<herospirit> WHY DO I KNOW IT.
<applebloommare> well everyone I gotta go see ya
<Barry1> someone has a lot of time on his/her hands
<DuskShine> This song?
<Luna> 07one moment
<DuskShine> Chrono Trigger.
<Roan> seey!
<herospirit> That would be why I know it
<EmmettBrown> One year on Uranus is roughly about 84 years on earth
<applebloommare> see ya
<DuskShine> Ciao Applebloom.
<EmmettBrown> bye Applebloom
<Barry1> That's nothing, one year on Pluto is about 216 years on Earth, isn't it?
<EmmettBrown> yep
<Luna> 07We're gonna make a list
<herospirit> That "so" face freaks me out
<Luna> 07put it up on the forums
<herospirit> XD
<EmmettBrown> Meaning you may only see Uranus once in your life
<Roan> *scrunch scrunch*
<Combustiblelemons> strangely close to their star nittany yes
<Combustiblelemons> or with elliptical orbits
<Luna> 07So that you all can get involved (if you want to)
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<EmmettBrown> Here is a little size comparison of Earth and Uranus http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Uranus%2C_Earth_size_comparison.jpg
<Barry1> wow
<Barry1> Uranus is huge, no pun intended
<DuskShine> Epic trombone filly.
<Combustiblelemons> not that big actually
<Combustiblelemons> compared to jupiter
<Nittany_Tiger> Some scientists think that our solar system is a special case because of there being so many of those strange arrangements.
<Luna> 07Alright?
<EmmettBrown> There's not much else to talk about Uranus
<Luna> 07guys?
<Barry1> There were many proto-planets, and scientists believe we were lucky in the circumstances
<ValtheJean> sounds good to me
<Nittany_Tiger> As in having gas giants far from their parent star is a special case.
<Wrek> 05to me atleast
<SirSprinkles> 6I shall brb
<herospirit> We need more Ponified versions of TouHou music :P
<Luna> 07me too
<EmmettBrown> It's a huge screwed up icey blue planet
<Combustiblelemons> apparently there was another gas giant in our solar system
<DecapKing> i think its pinkie and berry
<EmmettBrown> It's also very windy
<Combustiblelemons> made of litium
<interior_gummy> is this un owen?
<Octavia> 14Yup, sounds reasonable.
<Combustiblelemons> lithium*
<Barry1> Earth may not have given life if it weren't struck by a mars-sized prot-planet and gained its moon
<Denied_Existence> You are all quite strange....
<Barry1> proto-planet*
<Combustiblelemons> our sun absorbed it though
<Octavia> 14Whats the site use as coding anyway? I've not done site coding or maintenance in a while now...
<RainBroDash> 10facebook is being a bastard, I've authorised my account but it's taking loonng to get through
<DecapKing> and so are you
<herospirit> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/167/843/GOOFY%20TIME.png?1314582622

<RainBroDash> 10but when sprinkles gets back I'm ready to be admin'd
<DecapKing> as you are the one that writes clopfics
<Combustiblelemons> so there is strangely high amounts of lithium in the sun
<RainBroDash> 10>in after sprinkles
<EmmettBrown> In 4 billion years,Our earth will be pulled into our sun
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<prince-dari> Not java, javascript.
<Octavia> 14HTML is easy... Java not sure if I've done enough. I guess I'd have to see it.
<Barry1> Our sun didn't absorb our moon... yet
<Combustiblelemons> hero XD
<Nittany_Tiger> Didn't know that.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, javascript... >>;
<Octavia> 14:P
<herospirit> I made it myself, Lemons :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Anyway, brb
<Nittany_Tiger> Astronomy interests me a lot.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh....what is this vid called again?
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't kept up with it since leaving Clemson.
<EmmettBrown> Of course,in one billion years we will likely be extinct anyway
<interior_gummy> so, when will we be done with the playlist?
<Denied_Existence> Yeah? Well at least I write about relations between consenting ponies.
<Combustiblelemons> make that 5 million emmett
<Combustiblelemons> the male genome is dieing out
<EmmettBrown> ok ok
<Nittany_Tiger> If we don't get our ass off of Earth, we'll be gone sooner.
<Barry1> More like the sun will swallow our planet by swelling
<Combustiblelemons> scaring you all now ^_^
<Barry1> Yeah, as soon as 1 billion years
<EmmettBrown> both acutally
<ValtheJean> 2,14 why be scared? we'll have been dead WAY before then
<Barry1> In that length of time, Earth will become an uninhabitable wasteland
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Denied, that picture is a joke, and I didnt draw it
<interior_gummy> paused emoshy
<EmmettBrown> It will swell,and then it's gravity will be strong enough to pull us in
<Combustiblelemons> the future is grim no matter what way you look at it
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It was some random picture on google
<Pinkie_Pie> 13>.>
<herospirit> And if we're still alive by then, we'll probably be Universal level badasses of SCIENCE
<Denied_Existence> SHURE
<EmmettBrown> Anyway,back to Uranus
<Denied_Existence> THATS WHAT YOU SAY
<Barry1> No thanks
<Barry1> kiddingh
<Barry1> kidding*
<prince-dari> MFW already up to 10 cracked articles opened.
<RainBroDash> 10"Your account has been verified!"
<Combustiblelemons> well when matter falls apart, the human race will be gone
<prince-dari> Each of those will have a couple more articles I need to read.
<RainBroDash> 10>"Before you can set your username, you need to verify your account."
*Denied_Existence 3turns the desklamp onto Pinkie_Pie
<prince-dari> ;_____;
<Barry1> If it does
<RainBroDash> 10lol dari
<EmmettBrown> In astrology, the planet Uranus () is the ruling planet of Aquarius. Since Uranus is colored cyan and Uranus is associated with electricity, the color electric blue, a color close to cyan, is associated with the sign Aquarius
<Nittany_Tiger> Actually, the sun is getting warmer at it's surface as it burns through it's hydrogen fuel. As it does, it'll put Earth out of the "Life zone" before the sun starts it's gas giant phase.
<prince-dari> If I starve to death, bury Twilight with me.
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<Combustiblelemons> anyway, sirsprinkles, you there?
<Octavia> 14Dari, to quote Zecora... "you're doomed"

<Synros> lol
<EmmettBrown> The chemical element uranium, discovered in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, was named after the newly discovered planet Uranus
<Barry1> lol
<interior_gummy> ...anyone still waiting for gic?
<Nittany_Tiger> Which will happen between now and when the sun start helium burning (helium fusion).
*herospirit stares at Pinkie
<Pinkie_Pie> 13What? -.-
<herospirit> GIVE US YOUR SECRETS
<Barry1> Which will happen in about 1 or 2 billion years, right?
<prince-dari> >scientists can bring stuff back to life with nanobots
<prince-dari> O_o
<herospirit> ALL OF THEM
<Nittany_Tiger> 4 billion.
<Barry1> ah
<EmmettBrown> Also,heres Uranus as a crescent http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Uranus_Final_Image.jpg
<interior_gummy> y u no stream
<RainBroDash> 10fucks sake facebook
<RainBroDash> 10get your shit together
<Combustiblelemons> oh right- keep an eye on the star betelgeuse
<Barry1> still, Earth will become uninhabitable long before then
<Nittany_Tiger> Right now, our sun is in the main sequence phase of it's life.
<Combustiblelemons> it's going to go supernova soon
*Dermathil isn't afraid by the sun going supernova. Since he knows that by the time the sun goes that way, the human race would've had plenty of time to travel to new star systems.
<ValtheJean> I like ponie
<ValtheJean> s
<Combustiblelemons> it's in the constellation ursa major
<Barry1> as the sun warms up, the earth's surface temp will increase
<prince-dari> >Boeing built a death ray
<Nittany_Tiger> The sun won't explode.
*Dermathil knows they wouldn't die off just like that.
<prince-dari> Oh dear.
<Nittany_Tiger> It doesn't have enough mass.
<Dermathil> I know, Barry.
<Combustiblelemons> soon as in between now and 100 years,
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Secrets
<Pinkie_Pie> 13-.-
<RainBroDash> 10gonna watch a little bit of Haruhi to pass the time between facebook realising that facebook doesn't agree with facebook because facebook, and when it works.
<Dermathil> Yes it DOES, NIttany_Tiger. It just doesn't have enough to go from supernovae to black hole. It'll go from Supernovae to White Dwarf.
<herospirit> If we manage to NOT kill ourselves off by the time any of this happens, we'll probably be able to handle it. :0
<Dermathil> alright?
<Combustiblelemons> you won't need a telescope to see it though. it'll be like a second sun.
<Synros> i don't think it will be that soon
<Nittany_Tiger> Nope.
<EmmettBrown> Oddly,the planet Uranus has always fascinated me more than the others
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Consider this a threat
<Ziltoid> I can stare at emoshy forever
<prince-dari> "From 10,000 feet up and five miles away, this 40,000-pound, megawatt-class, chemical laser will metal a hole through a tank"
<Barry1> The Sun isn't big enough to go Supernova
<prince-dari> Damn.
<Nittany_Tiger> The sun won't explode.
<Denied_Existence> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/596.png
<Dermathil> YES IT IS, Barry.
<herospirit> MOAR SECRETS
<Barry1> Only super red giants go supernoca
<Combustiblelemons> Saturn interests me most of all
<RainBroDash> 10holy ducks
<prince-dari> OH WOW
<Barry1> supernova*
<prince-dari> "Or should we say, tanks"
<EmmettBrown> GREAT SCOTT
<ValtheJean> yeah, but how much energy does it use? :P
<Combustiblelemons> yep.
<ValtheJean> and how easy is it to aim?
<Dermathil> well then assume that by supernova I meant Red Giant, alright?
<Wrek> 05enough to blot out the sun
<prince-dari> "The ATL is intended to strike up to 100 targets in rapid succession"
<prince-dari> That's how easy it is to aim.
<Denied_Existence> 3Poor Steven, cut down in his prime...
<prince-dari> Holy shit.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13More?
<EmmettBrown> We...are...having...a...pleasant...conversation
<ValtheJean> the future man....the future
<Dermathil> itsy bitsy bug up in the dictionary up there
<Wrek> 05hmm dari, link?
<prince-dari> "Oh, and the beam's silent. And invisible"
<Nittany_Tiger> Stars with masses 15 times greater than the sun have supernovas at the end of their lifespan.
<Synros> well yah, our sun its a Medium large star. it is big enough to go supernova, but not for a while longer
<SirSprinkles> 6Buffer... buffer everywhere.
<prince-dari> >future
<RainBroDash> 10lol. it's got nothing on volta, the crazy bastard
<Barry1> fun fact, a nova isn't a star exploding, rather it's simply an intense effusion of light in a short time
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Are you sure that you want more Herospirit?
<prince-dari> >they already made it
<Combustiblelemons> on the internet? it won't last long
<Nittany_Tiger> 5 or 15.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13...
<Combustiblelemons> sprinkes, try refreshing
<Ziltoid> OH YEAH
<Octavia> 14Eh, this stuff isnt new to me. I'm a tech tard and it takes a lot to impress me. lol
<herospirit> Fuck space, we're a far bigger threat to ourselves than it will ever be
<herospirit> :P
<Combustiblelemons> i'mokaywiththis.jpg
<Wrek> 05how about the means to fold space?
<herospirit> YUS
<Combustiblelemons> hero- meteors
<Wrek> 05the tech is there, we just cant produce enough
<Octavia> 14Ehhh... lol
<prince-dari> They are going to showcase the laser later this year.
<Combustiblelemons> 2036 may be when one hits us D:
<Nittany_Tiger> Our sun won't because there's not enough mass to continue fusion past helium fusion.
<prince-dari> Everyone is fucked.
<Octavia> 14I think we'll have viable time travel too at some point perhaps.
<Dermathil> lemons, I'm pretty sure that by the end of the century we'll have setup a basic base on Mars, the equivalent of the ISS.
<Nittany_Tiger> In which leads to a core collapse followed by an explosion years later.
<Wrek> 05thats how equestra was made?
<RainBroDash> 10well, forwards, right?
<Octavia> 14Technology is infinite.
<RainBroDash> 10not backwards surely
<Dermathil> (even if it is as cramped as the ISS though0
<Denied_Existence> SirSprinkles That is a naughty word! Quit that right now!
<Pinkie_Pie> 13*cough*
<RainBroDash> 10and technology is infinite, human production isn't :P
<prince-dari> Octavia: So the fact that real zombies exist didn't impress you? :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Our sun is going to expand out and leave a carbon-oxygen white dwarf behind.
<ValtheJean> according to hawking
<herospirit> All of the secrets
<DuskShine> Oh jeez, this song.
<Synros> we'll most likely kill ourselves off in the end
<RainBroDash> 10we're plateauing hard
<ValtheJean> travelling to the future is impossible
<Nittany_Tiger> It won't explode.
<interior_gummy> so are you accepting requests later or not?
<Octavia> 14That... wasn't so much technology as... wtf? lol
<EmmettBrown> I have to go to bed.I expect essays on what you have learnt about the moon and Uranus on my desk tomorrow morning.Class dismissed
<DuskShine> I don't really feel like crying right now. =/
<Dat_Pon-3> ooooo i love this version of at the gala
<herospirit> What Synros said.
<Combustiblelemons> when it's a white dwarf it's still fusing though isn't it?
<Octavia> 14Fuck Hawking lol
<Barry1> So stars fuse Hydrogen into Helium and Helium into...?
<ValtheJean> lol
<Dermathil> THAT'S what I said earlier Nittany. That the sun would go red giant and become white dwarf. Just mistook Red Giant and Supernova, alright?
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/320fdbffade87450cdfb07fd575228ac/15746%20-%20Molestia%20advice_pony%20celestia%20meme%20trollestia%20tyrant.png
<Nittany_Tiger> Nope.
<RainBroDash> 10valthejean I think it's travelling to the past that is impossible, not the future?
*DuskShine turns up the volume anyways.
<Octavia> 14He isnt the know all end all to everything. :P
<Combustiblelemons> helium into lithium
<Nittany_Tiger> Ok.
<Synros> that or Aliens take over
<prince-dari> Traveling to the future is possible.
<prince-dari> ?
<Dermathil> Barry1: heavier metals.
<RainBroDash> 10yeah
<prince-dari> I swear he said it was.
<ValtheJean> err, sorry
<Nittany_Tiger> A white dwarf isn't fusing anything.
<Octavia> 14I think it may be evnetually.
<ValtheJean> I got that backwords
<RainBroDash> 10xD <3
<prince-dari> And I thought electrons did travel through time anyway?
<Ziltoid> Did not know that bronies would be so astrologically inclined
<Dermathil> But it is still burning
<Nittany_Tiger> It's just hot from being the center of a star.
<Barry1> White Dwarfs will eventually go black dwarfs as its heat dissipates
<EmmettBrown> I shall see you next week Bronystate
<prince-dari> (MFW I talk about things I have no idea about)
<Denied_Existence> Oi, we got two silly fillies in here. One talking about the sun, the other about the moon
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Hmmm
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Nah
<EmmettBrown> Good night
<Barry1> a black dwarf is a truly dead star
<ValtheJean> lol'
<Octavia> 14Though it stands to reason, why havent we see it in our past yet. Or maybe we have and just havent noticed.
<Combustiblelemons> astronomy fascinates all of mankind.
<prince-dari> They disappear and reappear simultaneously in different places or something.
<Combustiblelemons> the universe isn't old enough to have a black dwarf though.
<Barry1> A star can't get any deader than black dwarf
<Dermathil> Ziltoid, this is called the internet. Also, geek culture. Half of it is sci-fi and sciences, the other half is Fantasy and History. Both bases covered!
<Synros> ahh this song.....
<Dermathil> Indeed, Combustiblelemons.
<RainBroDash> 10dai they travel still at reasonable speeds
<Ziltoid> Science.
<herospirit> Obviously, the biggest threats to the human race are JRPG VILLAINS
<Dermathil> No black dwarves yet.
<Ziltoid> so um...
<RainBroDash> 10but you can't tell what they do between two instances of being detected
<Nittany_Tiger> A white dwarf is a bunch of atoms crammed together as close together (before neutron degeneracy occurs).
<Ziltoid> I wanna go to mars already damn it
<Dat_Pon-3> and i just came
<Dermathil> Though, I do wonder: is the universe old enough for brown dwarves?
<Nittany_Tiger> It is.
<Combustiblelemons> neutron stars are epic
<interior_gummy> wtf is in the background
<Barry1> Before we go to mars, we may colonize the Moon
<herospirit> Can I be a JRPG villain?
<Combustiblelemons> my favourite kind of stars ^_^
<Dermathil> um, not really barry1.
<Barry1> That would make a better take off point
<DuskShine> Here it comes...
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Combustiblelemons> they're the strobe lights of the universe
<Nittany_Tiger> White dwarfs are held up by electron degeneracy.
<herospirit> I need a sword larger than myself and either spikey or flowing hair
<Dermathil> They abandoned the moon colonization program to concentrate on mars instead.
<herospirit> THE BEST AT PARTIES?
<RainBroDash> 10most people take the stance that you can model an electron as having a certain probability to appear at a certain point in spacetime, with speeds greater than the speed of light being negligible in terms of probability
<Dermathil> They want to skip one of the stairs's steps
<DuskShine> And there it went.
<Barry1> I wonder how the universe would look to a person who could actually see X-rays?
<ValtheJean> this is why I'm an english major
<Combustiblelemons> the moon could be colonized though
<DuskShine> ... I think listening to this five times now kinda dulled the impact it has on me.
<herospirit> PINKIE, Y U NO GIVE ADMIN
<RainBroDash> 10this is why I'm taking physics
<Dermathil> Barry1, look at the pictures of the universe.
<ValtheJean> :P
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/c37ff3e9792c7dce80644269c17c2d13/15999%20-%20Molestia%20caption%20celestia%20computer%20genderswap.png
<Ziltoid> pinkie is best party pony
<Wrek> 05this is why i didnt choose physics B
<Combustiblelemons> with the discovery of water on the moon, theres some interest again
<E_N> PINKIE, Y U NO GIVE OWNER?
<Barry1> I wonder how Earth would look like that?
<Dermathil> water on mars too
<Octavia> 14lol
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Dunno
<prince-dari> What's that thing that behaves differently when it's observed and when it's not?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll show you Barry
<Dermathil> Barry1: a big lightbulb.
<Barry1> lol
<Nittany_Tiger> There's an X-ray shot of the universe around.
<Combustiblelemons> i say we concentrate our money on space exploration
<interior_gummy> why does worst pony have best part?
<prince-dari> Oh, that ^
<RainBroDash> 10everything sub-atomic basically. but the classic example is the elecron, or photon
<Barry1> who's worst pony?
<E_N> 7E_N Y U NO BEEN TYPING IN COLORS?
<RainBroDash> 10yeah, the double slit is the classic example
<herospirit> We have seen a potentially life supporting planet. the catch is that it would take 76 years to reach there, going at the speed of light. :I
<Combustiblelemons> seeing as there's rocks made of titanium floating around space, you could make billions.
<Dermathil> I'm pretty sure we send a lot of every type of signals across all frequencies.
<prince-dari> Yeah, I meant the double slit, that's the one I've heard of.
<Dermathil> We're kind of sitting ducks
<RainBroDash> 10you doing physics AS?
<Dermathil> the good kind, that is
<Dermathil> heheheh
<interior_gummy> Barry1: twilight
<herospirit> 15COLLOOOOOOOORS
<Barry1> ok
<Synros> Combus, the water on the moon is different to that on Earth. Its molecular struture is different. Meaning we could could never drink it.
<prince-dari> I chose physics, maths, chemistry, and further maths.
<Combustiblelemons> wormholes herospirit- possible or not?
<Nittany_Tiger> http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/xallsky_rosat110.jpg
<RainBroDash> 10hehe, so I assume you're going to do well then :p
<Barry1> Possible, but unsafe
<SirSprinkles> 6Fuck yeah maths~
<Combustiblelemons> agreed
<Dermathil> Barry1: not twilight. SilverSpoon and Diamond Tiara are worst ponies. Along with Blueblood.
<herospirit> 15So, from the Mane 6, who is everyone going to main in Fighting is Magic?
<RainBroDash> 10I was one mark off a B in maths dari
<interior_gummy> worst main pony
<prince-dari> We'll see. XD
<RainBroDash> 10I was livid
<Barry1> very dangerous to try to traverse wormholes
<herospirit> 15I say from the Mane 6 because no one else is confirmed to be in the game yet.
<prince-dari> Oh God, one mark.
<Barry1> it's like sticking your hand into a bubble
<prince-dari> Worst feeling ever.
<RainBroDash> 10 1 UMS.
<RainBroDash> 10not even one mark
<prince-dari> LOL FAIL
<Ziltoid> How about this
<Barry1> it's possible, if you do it right
<interior_gummy> and you're SUPPOSED to hate blueblood and those other two little bitches
<E_N> 7Rarity, for her awesome bitchslap
<DecapKing> 4http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/4a397dd9ef0a908edfdb77afbf0cc9c3/50481%20-%20Caboose%20Halo%20Spartan%20artist%3Axeno-scorpion-alien%20crossover%20earth_pony%20master_chief%20meta%20rvb.png
<RainBroDash> 10it was two thirds of a percent or something stupid
<Ziltoid> Who is best pet?
<Denied_Existence> Pinkie Pie is pcool
<interior_gummy> gummy
<Nittany_Tiger> Wormholes are thought to exist in rotating black holes (well, a form of them).
<Synros> But if we were to put a base on the moon, we could still use to I think it we'd just need to chemically alter it. Think there was to much H in it
<interior_gummy> i am best pet
<Ziltoid> inby interior_gummy says gummy
<herospirit> 15I really want to say I'd main Twilight, but she's not really my gameplay style....
<Ziltoid> doh
<SirSprinkles> 6Gave you admin on the failbook, RainBro.
<herospirit> 15I'm more of a rushdown guy.
<Barry1> If you do it wrong, the whole thing collapses
<E_N> 7In all honesty, it'd be AppleJack
<RainBroDash> 10ty, but my facebook thing isn't running right anyway
<Denied_Existence> 3Rainbow Dash
<Barry1> like popping a bubble
<E_N> 7I think she'd fit my fighting style best
<Combustiblelemons> well, all celestial bodies contain valuable elements
<RainBroDash> 10I can't do anything with it yet
<Denied_Existence> 3I got a connection here mind you
<Barry1> only millions of times worse
<RainBroDash> 10because facebook
<Bmartin82> any ircops available to do a webirc ?
<Nittany_Tiger> I read that somewhere.
<Denied_Existence> 3Being the element of loyalty myself and all...
<herospirit> 15and Twilight's zoning, which is about as far from rush down as possible.
<Nittany_Tiger> You can't throw matter into a wormhole.
<DuskShine> Man, that Last Night Best Night/At the Gala mix...
<Dermathil> interior_gummy: there's no worse main pony.
<Combustiblelemons> you can't?
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe not even energy.
<Combustiblelemons> why not?
<Ziltoid> im still playing pony vs pony
<Dermathil> Also, wormholes tear you apart when you go in em
<interior_gummy> Dermathil: except twilight and applejack
<Nittany_Tiger> Don't know.
<Ziltoid> COUNFUND THEM
<Combustiblelemons> that's black holes
<Barry1> Just like how you have to soak your hand before being able to stick it into a bubble and keep it steady, you have to either prep the ship or the wormhole to use it
<herospirit> 15I may end up as a RD player myself, as I'm assuming she'll have DEM AIR COMBOS
<DuskShine> Y'know, I really shouldn't jump to conclusions about it not having an effect on me.
<Synros> well we don't know that Nittany
<DuskShine> Shortly after saying it stopped making me cry, I burst into tears at Twilight's verse.
<Combustiblelemons> anti matter rockets anyone?
<Synros> everything is speculation
<Octavia> 14Which is why I dont use FB, bleh lol
<Nittany_Tiger> It's probably due to the stress matter puts on space-time.
<Nittany_Tiger> It screws with the wormhole and collapses it.
<Bmartin82> i already have it configured in my ircd then upon reading more i noticed i was supose to talk to an ircop here to relay the info here
<Luna> 07octavia will go twittah? :P
<E_N> 7Although, if Spitfire is in the game, I will play her and only her
<Veewave> How did I get distracted by Pony vs Pony for 3 hours, damn.
<Combustiblelemons> what do you hold anti matter inside of to make the most powerful rocket possible?
<herospirit> 15xD
<Denied_Existence> 3C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER-EAKER-EAKER
<Nittany_Tiger> I have a degree in physics.
<E_N> 7Cause let's face it, she's best pony
<prince-dari> >droid soldiers that can fire 40mm grenades at a rate of 4,000 a SECOND
<prince-dari> HOLY SHIT
<DecapKing> 4http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/05b4cb6b621b9e302f68177d67cd16a4/53004%20-%20Molestia%20blank_flank%20celestia%20deadpool%20spiderman%20spiderpony.png
<prince-dari> That's even better than the railgun.
<Nittany_Tiger> With an astronomy concentration.
<RainBroDash> 10I have to use fb or i get left out of th-
<RainBroDash> 10ASHDASDNAD DARI WAT
<Denied_Existence> 3I don't get it
<prince-dari> The company who makes the robot side is called iRobot.
<herospirit> 15Okay, so now speculating. Who do you want to main who you think will be in the game?
<prince-dari> That's just scary. XD
<Combustiblelemons> anyway- goodnight all :D
<Denied_Existence> 3Unless this has some relation to a certain fanfiction
<Nittany_Tiger> I might go back to physics for my Ph.D.
<FormalHavvy> It also appears I'm the only IRC OP here, and as far as I know, the web:irc update tool is still unavailable to us, so you'll have to send the data via email.
<E_N> 7This channel is now Spiderman channel?
<Dermathil> interior_gummy: twilight and AJ are not worse than any of them. They all need eachothers to function properly. Like a well-oiled machine that lacks a few major components.
<RainBroDash> 10oh yeah dari I made a coilgun as a project for my personal statement. Bitches loved my personal statement
<Synros> but thats just wat we know of the space-time theory. Everything we know about space is propably rong
<Veewave> Good night.
<DecapKing> 4its spidermane
<Denied_Existence> 3Pinkie! Mod me quick!
<interior_gummy> Dermathil: no
<Nittany_Tiger> Possibly.
<Nittany_Tiger> All we know about space-time is in Einstein's equations.
<Bmartin82> and you just need my server name and the webirc password right ?
<prince-dari> Wut O_o
<Dermathil> gummy: YES.
<DecapKing> 4im going to get kicked/banned lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Which have proven to be very true for now.
<Octavia> 14Twitter... ugh. XD
<E_N> GAIS CALM DOWN, WE ALL KNOW SPITFIRE IS BEST PONY
<Denied_Existence> 3Time is not on our side!
<RainBroDash> 10Personal Statement. I guess you haven't started the whole UCAS thing yet?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Denied_Existence> *Facehoof*
<Synros> I mean we are less then a grain of sand in this universe. I doubt scientist can claim that something is or isn't possible. They have no idea.
<RainBroDash> 10lol
<Combustiblelemons> Soarin. that is all. goodnight everyone.
<prince-dari> Screw that.
<Octavia> 14I'll handle Twitter if you want. lol
<herospirit> 15I don't know if good ol' Derpy Hooves has a chance to be in the game. I mean, she IS in the show, but really, for a moveset they'd have to take from fanon.
<Denied_Existence> Goodnight Combustiblelemons
<interior_gummy> also, y u no sea ponies?
<SirSprinkles> 6...why did I just eat my chocolate BEFORE my sushi?
<interior_gummy> bye lemons
<SirSprinkles> 6This was a good idea.
<FormalHavvy> http://wiki.mibbit.com/index.php/Enable_Mibbit_on_Your_IRC_Server#WebIRC.2FCGI:IRC_Blocks The information in step 3.
<Ziltoid> yfw in season rainbowdash leaves mane six
<Octavia> 14Because cookie
<Bmartin82> ok
<DecapKing> 4http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/b5cc87d454063d5dfb037f0a06ed7c34/3379%20-%20S.T.A.L.K.E.R.%20artist%3Arubrony%20comic%20derpy_hooves%20stalker.jpg
<herospirit> Off beat now :0
<Denied_Existence> Oh interior_gummy Val LOVES seaponies, you should send him some
<E_N> 7If Spitfire is not in the game, someone is going to die
<SirSprinkles> 6Actually a cookie and a candy bar...
<Dermathil> Nittany_Tiger: what we know of Space-Time is that it is a curve around any and all masses in the universe.
<Dermathil> OH OH, Do dat
<RainBroDash> 10basically the personal statement is where you tell the uni why they should accept you. That and your predicted grades lead to an interview
<Octavia> 14Some Caramac for Val's sake? lol
<Dermathil> SHOOBEDOO SHOOB SHOOBEDOO
<herospirit> 15Don't get your hopes TOO high E_N.
<ValtheJean> >:(
<Nittany_Tiger> And it comes from Einstein's equations.
<Bmartin82> i already have the cgiirc block setup
<DecapKing> 4http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/4c4bd3e1ef37d92619a90fa1c61a67db/25034%20-%20S.T.A.L.K.E.R.%20ponified.jpg
<Octavia> 14lol
<RainBroDash> 10I had shit predicted grades because I didn't do well in AS, so I made up for it with a sick personal statement.
<interior_gummy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM
<desertman2> nooooooooo
<Bmartin82> but i will gather that info and send an email
<Bmartin82> :)
<herospirit> 15Only 17 characters, and 6 of those are the Mane 6. And at least one is a non-pony. That leaves only 10 spaces for side ponies
<Dermathil> Yes, Nittany_Tiger. I read that equation. (yes, it was on wikipedia. Wait. Or was it in Stephen Hawking's biographical book?)
<prince-dari> >coil gun gets you into uni
<prince-dari> Wut
<prince-dari> How do?
<E_N> Smooze is better
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Mod you why?
<Denied_Existence> 3IDK
<Dermathil> SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
<ValtheJean> 2,14 this song is absolutely terrible
<Denied_Existence> 3Because?
<Dermathil> THE SMOOZE TAKES ALL
<E_N> 7SPITFIRE BETTER BE ONE OF THOSE PONIES
<RainBroDash> 10coil gun and lies
<Nittany_Tiger> G(u,v) = 8(pi)T(u,v) - R(u,v)
<Barry1> Spoiler: In Pokemon Best Wishes, Meowth was fired from Team Rocket and now travels with Ash
<RainBroDash> 10ftw
<Dermathil> *glomps*
<prince-dari> XD
<Denied_Existence> 3I am the element of loyalty you know, you can trust me
<interior_gummy> anyone else realize that the sea ponies are barely doing anything to help them, and are just singing?
<DecapKing> 4http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/95b262dda9136beb0497b182026e0917/26002%20-%20Roadside_Picnic%20S.T.A.L.K.E.R.%20original_character%20tagme.jpg
<RainBroDash> 10not lies.. just truth-bendings
<ValtheJean> 2,14 like seriously...I don't think person ever considered...you know...tone...or any musical device
<herospirit> SMOOZE FOR SEASON 2! LET'S START A PETITION
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I dont trust any of you savage dogs
<Pinkie_Pie> 13XD
<Nittany_Tiger> A 4th-degree tensor equation.
<RainBroDash> 10basically, I had some friends in the lower years when I was in years 10 and 11, being in a boarding house
<Dermathil> TOO LATE, herospirit.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Now, im trying to fix some food D=
<herospirit> 15You can trust me :3
<Dermathil> But I suggest you make the petition for SEASON 3!!!
<prince-dari> Eugh boarding.
<Dermathil> now THAT would be a good idea
<RainBroDash> 10I used to help them by teaching them french and sciences
<Barry1> Season 2 will air in 2 weeks
<herospirit> Let's do it. :3
<Ziltoid> gah
<Dermathil> EXACTLY
<prince-dari> Eugh French
<DuskShine> This PMV.
<E_N> SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
<Nittany_Tiger> Actually, it would be 2nd-order.
<herospirit> OOOOOOOOOOH YEEEEEEEEEEEEAH PONIES
<Veewave> Nice.
<RainBroDash> 10oh, and spanish
<Barry1> on Saturday, September 17
<Dermathil> ANd who knows how awesome the smooze could be made by the FiM team?
<RainBroDash> 10I was a don at languages
<Octavia> 14Well, this is kinda disheartening. Someone already took my name for the site that runs that pony game. Bleh.
<herospirit> WE'RE NO STRANGERS TO SMOOZE
<ValtheJean> so are we ready to discuss again?
<prince-dari> Never took Spanish, so I can't comment onthat.
<Dermathil> Because we know they could make it FUCKING EPIC
<DecapKing> 4damn you must get annoyed easily Pinkie
<RainBroDash> 10anyway, tl;dr. I wrote:
<Barry1> I'd imagine Pinkie doing this
<Dermathil> and?
<E_N> 7I kicked you bro
<Dermathil> doing what/
<RainBroDash> 10"At my secondary school in Year 11, I was given the opportunity to mentor younger students in my boarding house in Physics and French. In tutoring the younger students, I had to be very sure in the basic principles that made up those two subjects, and ways to express them in an appropriate manner. I also gained better presentational skills through this."
<Barry1> Rickrolling
<RainBroDash> 10 9005% lies
<E_N> 7Your picture keep dissapearing
<Dermathil> >unmutes stream
<Barry1> or in this case, Pinkierolling
<DecapKing> 4oh
<Octavia> 14ITS OVER... yeah...
<RainBroDash> 10based on relative truths I guess
*Dermathil starts dancing
<DecapKing> 4ill just mini link
<brony4ever43> whoa, i come in and get rickroled by the ponys
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<brony4ever43> thats a good omen
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHA
<brony4ever43> XDD
<prince-dari> Dat bullshitting
<Wrek> 05what is the purpose off, and future plans of the BMN Devart?
*Dermathil is still feeling slightly bonkers from his brain thinkings from this morning
*Ziltoid does the Herbert West cackle
<Dermathil> BTW, WHERE THE HAY IS NEWDCD
<RainBroDash> 10it's just there because someone wanted to be useful for 30 seconds;D
<Dermathil> WE NEED HIM FOR THE ROBOT NIGHT SATURDAY SHOW
<RainBroDash> 10we've done nothing with it as yet
<Barry1> PAGING NEWDCD! NEWDCD!
<Ziltoid> Newdcd got abducted by ponies
<Dermathil> DO IT FILLY
<Denied_Existence> 3.....Uh.....we are talking about PVP right?
<Barry1> or aliens
<RainBroDash> 10but I think the idea was to conduct BMN business with it, and maybe post like events on it
<Octavia> 14Guess we could use it for all our banners and such art.
<Barry1> or *GASP* alien ponies
<FreezeFrame> Is that Flutterdash implications for this video?
<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug*
<herospirit> I still need to read 75 pages of the Odyssey tonight....
<RainBroDash> 10and release special theme nights on it, for the niche market I guess
<Barry1> ouch
<Dermathil> do it herospirit.
<Octavia> 14I think we kinda just created one to have one. :P
<E_N> 7For pvp RB or other pegasus are better
<RainBroDash> 10^
<Dermathil> The Odyssey is an awesome read.
<FreezeFrame> Odyssey is good
<SirSprinkles> 6I was thinking using it for contests.
<E_N> 7AJ is best for vs computer
<Dermathil> SWIM ON A FLOATING RAFT
<SirSprinkles> 6It's there, and that's all that really matters atm.
<Barry1> what is it with falling ponies and flailing?
<E_N> 7Haha GGgala is HOP
<Dermathil> IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
<Synros> wat ever happened to their necklaces of Harmony they got in the 2nd episode?
<E_N> 7I forgot
<brony4ever43> ikr?
<Octavia> 14Hmm...
<prince-dari> >"telepone pole-sized tungsten rods dropping from an orbital weapons platform at 36,000 feet per second to impact the earth below with the force of a meteor strike"
<Barry1> they might return
<prince-dari> Fucking really?
<Dermathil> Synros: they got absorbed back in their bodies
<prince-dari> Isn't that a bit over the top?
<FreezeFrame> it'll be explained
<herospirit> But Dermathil.... Ponies
<Synros> ive wondered that since the 3rd one
<Barry1> It seems likely with Discord
<RainBroDash> 10O.o
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I dont get annoyed easily
<SirSprinkles> 6RAPE RODS
<Synros> oh
<RainBroDash> 10^
<Dermathil> I KNOES THE PLOT OF THE TWO-PARTER, BTW
<Octavia> 14Sounds a bit old-fashioned.
<Barry1> they might need the elements for him
<DecapKing> 4i thought you kicked me pinkie
<Octavia> 14Lmao
<interior_gummy> so is this a postshow or a preshow?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But I have been bored lately, and its starting to affect me
<Pinkie_Pie> 13No, I didnt
<DecapKing> 4not EN
<Barry1> postshow
<desertman2> both
<Pinkie_Pie> 13That was that foal E_N
<Barry1> both, right
<Synros> I hope Discord doesn't turn into another Nightmare Moon. that would just suck
<prince-dari> Lawl
<DuskShine> Congrats Dermathil.
<DuskShine> Don't spoil it.
<E_N> 7>foal
<RainBroDash> 10yeah but hilariously so
<E_N> 7>mfw
<FreezeFrame> Dermathil: I don't want to
<prince-dari> The brute force of hundred-kilogram rods traveling over 7,000 MPH makes them ideal for penetrating underground bunkers, your mother, and hardened nuclear missile silos.
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/k4NPqi
*Dermathil got it spoiled to him about two weeks back
<Barry1> The elements can do more than just save
*Dermathil has his lips sealed
<E_N> 7I don't invite Dari into our Bunker
<Dermathil> SHHH BARRY
<Octavia> 14LOL
*DuskShine hugs Dermathil.
<Octavia> 14>your mother
<RainBroDash> 10fuck ion cannons, relativistically accelerated particles, railguns
<DuskShine> Thank you!
<Octavia> 14>you won't need anything that strong
<RainBroDash> 10>metal rod, from really high up
<Pinkie_Pie> 13You dont trust Dari?
<Synros> lol
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol
<Dermathil> I'M 78.4% SURE YOU KNOW TOO
<Wrek> 05win
<Dermathil> SO SHUSH
<herospirit> BARRYYYYYYYYYY
<Barry1> I imagine they can destroy just as easily
<Pinkie_Pie> 13He said he would read the fic on livestream, so that Val would hear it
<Dermathil> Oh
<DuskShine> I want to be unspoiled so when I see the two parter, it's new to me.
<Dat_Pon-3> did i miss the lottery?
<desertman2> yes
<Synros> yup
<DuskShine> I had too much of season one spoiled for me just by trying to find links to the episodes when they came out.
<Dat_Pon-3> awwww
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/c1B439
<DecapKing> 4http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/967029d29d4425e593f167db9cc4598f/48922%20-%20Sweetie_Belle%20apple_bloom%20applejack%20artist%3Ashutterflye%20blank_flank%20dance_dance_revolution%20deleteme_old_version%20derpy_hooves%20dinky_hooves%20drummania%20fixed_cutie_mark%20flutterrage%20fluttershy%20guitar_hero%20pinkie_pie%20rainbow_dash%20rarity%20scootaloo%20twili
<Dermathil> Barry1, this is obvious. CELESTIA said she used them to banish Luna to the moon for a millenia. Is that enough proof?
<Synros> I did too, freaking power was out for 7 hours here
<Dat_Pon-3> what was picked?
<prince-dari> >strike with the force of a nuke
<prince-dari> >no radiation
<Barry1> But they didn't kill, just banish
*Dermathil goes back to watching the godawful 11th doctor
<prince-dari> Handy
<brony4ever43> brb(im not talking much so it dosnt matter XDD) trying to finish a PMV
<ValtheJean> did we have anything else to talk about? Or is it safe to say this is concluded for now?
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/5uoJBd
<GGgala> dat character limit
*DuskShine bucks Barry1 in the shin.
<Dermathil> Barry, that much power can kill or wound or do whatever you want.
<DuskShine> Stop it.
<DecapKing> 4im making a wall of blue
<herospirit> Unz
<RainBroDash> 10well I've got nothing else to discuss personally
*RainBroDash 10shrugs
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/5AOEWg
<Dermathil> Luna just happened to be lucky to have a pacifist sister.
<Octavia> 14Think we're done for the time being.
<prince-dari> Wow.
*Barry1 bucks right back
<Synros> ha
<prince-dari> I didn't think it could get any more ridiculous than giant rods falling from the sky.
<prince-dari> I was wrong.
<prince-dari> So very wrong.
<Barry1> I imagine I could figure the mechanics of such a move out
<prince-dari> >Modular Disc-Wing Urban Cruise Munitions (i.e. Exploding Flying Saucers)
<DuskShine> 8-bit remixes! Awesome.
<Octavia> 14Awesome!
<ValtheJean> well, in that case I'm getting some pressure from a few friends of mine to spend time with them (I've been ignoring them as of late). So I think I'll bid you all adieur for now
<prince-dari> Bye.
<Ziltoid> oh no
<herospirit> WAT
<Octavia> 14War is getting more entertaining and fun!
<herospirit> DAT EQD POST
<ValtheJean> see you all later
<Barry1> True, Dermathil, but can they...
<Octavia> 14Later Dari
<RainBroDash> 10so dari, how does it feel that halfway through your course, around the exact time you're learning the basics of the Standard Model of particle physics, we're going to find out if the current extent of the Standard Model is right or not? (i.e. CERN will be done colliding at the energy levels that the Higgs boson should appear at)
<RainBroDash> 10cya valthejean
<desertman2> not awesome whenyou see the buffering
<Barry1> GRANT WISHES?
<GGgala> it's a drinking game AND a card game?
<prince-dari> Octavia: I'm not leaving. :P
<RainBroDash> 10lolwut octavia :P
<Octavia> 14Oops lol
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<desertman2> Maybe you drink cards
<Octavia> 14Misread the wrong line XD
<Barry1> lol
<herospirit> SPACE IS MADE OF MIND DUST, AND THE STARS ARE WIIIIISHEEEEES
<prince-dari> RainBroDash: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<GGgala> yu-gi-oh would be a better show if it worked like that.
<RainBroDash> 10tl;dr, physics will be right or wrong, and the /correctness/ won't affect your syllabus
<Octavia> 14I thought Vals message was Daris and then I read him saying "bye" :P
<prince-dari> Well at least I'll still be in school to relearn it the right way if it's wrong.
<RainBroDash> 10no you won't :P
<Dermathil> Barry1: I am 99.99999% repeating that YES, they are capable. This is a show with creatures from the fricking D&D monsters manual for gods sake.

<E_N> 7Spiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin~
<RainBroDash> 10conventional current is still backwards after hundreds of years ;)
<Barry1> Several franchises use the rule of 7. MLP isn't one of them
<Dermathil> I guess we can say the FiM universe is "Darker and Edgier" than the original show
<Barry1> It doesn't even use the rule of three properly
<RainBroDash> 10they won't re-print textbooks to say 'we now have no fucking clue how particles get inertial mass, but they do'
<Dermathil> Maybe it does
<RainBroDash> 10hooray for science XD
<Barry1> But at least it avoids 4 is death
<prince-dari> Pfft.
<MeteorVenture> apple bloom is playing a guitar hero 2 guitar and i think sweetie belle is too from the shape.. but that's not a color i know of D:
<prince-dari> Not a single fuck.
<E_N> >Cast wish
<E_N> >mfw
<prince-dari> Zombies exist, your arguement is invalid.
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<RainBroDash> 10<3
<DecapKing> 4thats a bass guitar
<herospirit> -Paula used Pray
<Dermathil> Yet we have to see the 7th and 3rd respectively that could appear in S2, if my intuitions are correct (that is based on the speculations, not on the spoilers I know)
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<RainBroDash> 10brb i need some apple and blackcurrant squash. I'm getting all giddy and excited about physics again
<herospirit> -Giygas takes 26 damage
<MeteorVenture> guitar hero 2 doesn't have vocals
<prince-dari> Ok.
<RainBroDash> 10this should calm me down :L
<Dermathil> Just one thing: What could Discord represent that could complete BOTH the rule of 7 and the rule of 3?
*RainBroDash 10is a loser, dealwithit
<Octavia> 14<mfw vampire fleshlights exist...
<Octavia> 14OH LAWDY
<prince-dari> >word flank in article
<prince-dari> Heheheheh
<Barry1> jiraichi used Wish
<Dermathil> Shouldn't be too hard if I thought it out, eh?
<Wrek> 05mfw playing doom again
<Octavia> 14:P
<Barry1> *waits a while, nothing happens*
<Dermathil> Or is that my bonkers half-mind speaking?
<MeteorVenture> and i don't think that controller is compatible with other games.. at least none with vocals as far as i'm aware
<MeteorVenture> this is a problem!
<Synros> nyanyan
<Dermathil> Barry1: 6+1=7. 2+1=3
<MeteorVenture> unless scootaloo is playing singstar then that's all ok
<Pinkie_Pie> 13MeteorVenture
<Dermathil> DON'T FORGET YER MATHS
<herospirit> -Rainbow Dash attacks! Discord takes no damage.
<E_N> 7Haha according to the access list I'm a founder of bunker
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I have been waiting for you return
<Barry1> So your saying there could be a seventh element?
<Dermathil> WHAT DO YOU THINK DISCORD IS?
<Barry1> what's more powerful than magic?
<MeteorVenture> i've been here.. just didn't have anything to say
<herospirit> -You cannot comprehend the form of Discord's attack! Party takes 113 damage
<E_N> 7http://th04.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2011/213/1/0/first_day_of_flight_camp_by_egophiliac-d42fd3n.png
<E_N> 7ohai best filly
<Barry1> A wild Discord appeared! Go Dialga!
<Dermathil> My personal guess is that Discord will be equivalent to the "element of evil" in many games.
<DecapKing> 4your picture derped
<Dermathil> also, Completes the "Holy Trinity" with Luna and Celestia
<E_N> 7http://miburl.com/7KLhYi
<Dermathil> so there you go
<E_N> 7ohai again best filly
<Denied_Existence> 3Wait...DAIR PROMISED TO READ IT!?
<prince-dari> LOL
<Barry1> Dialga uses Roar of Time! It doesn't affect Discord!
<DuskShine> All this speculation is making me hungry.
<Denied_Existence> 3GET THAT MAN IN HERE
<Dermathil> you got your rule of 7 and your rule of 3
<AllisZero> Luna joins the mane 6 in season 2, discuss!
<prince-dari> MFW eHow.com has instructions on how to make a tesla coil.
<Pinkie_Pie> Prince-Dari
<DecapKing> 4DARI
<DecapKing> 4DAIR
<prince-dari> ?
<DecapKing> 4DARI
<Pinkie_Pie> Denied wants a word with you in Bunker
<MeteorVenture> what's up pinkie pie?
<prince-dari> What?
<Dermathil> Bunker? wat is dat?
<RainBroDash> 10when we were boarding we always wanted to make a tabletop railgun
<E_N> 7Just realized he hadn't finished reading the latest chapter of FO:#
<Dermathil> how do I not know what that is?
<RainBroDash> 10it never happened.. >.>
<Octavia> 14Mmmmm... tesla coils...
<Barry1> Discord vanished!
<E_N> 7FO:E
<prince-dari> Their paranoia channel.
<Dermathil> OH
<Dermathil> hahaha
<RainBroDash> 10so I had to settle for 2nd best: coil gun
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Pinkie_Pie> Its the place where we do things you dont know about
<DuskShine> I haven't read any of it. =/
<DecapKing> 4theres a tag on Ponibooru called 'Milfy Hooves' O.O
<Barry1> Dialga needs to recharge!
<DuskShine> O_o
<herospirit> -Twilight Sparkle uses pray! Your prayer goes unheard. Fluttershy casts heal! Rarity is healed 79 points. Pinkie Pie is dancing. Applejack attacks! Discord takes no damage.
<Dermathil> OH, so some kind of shippy channel then...
<prince-dari> Can't talk anyway, banned from your channel.
<RainBroDash> 10^lol
<MeteorVenture> OC no doubt
<Pinkie_Pie> You are?
<DuskShine> ... lol
<Dermathil> Where have I heard about something like that before?
<DecapKing> 4eeeeeeeeeyup
<E_N> Who banned you?
<prince-dari> Dunno
<Ziltoid> umad dari?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Erm
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> I'm on the channel.
<prince-dari> Just banned.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It would seem that Prince-Dari is banned
<DecapKing> 4and a giant one called 'lesbian' which doesnt suprise me
<DuskShine> It might be because Steven_Magnet is banned.
<DuskShine> Maybe.
<MeteorVenture> that's why i prefer bronibooru
<DuskShine> lesbian isn't so bad.
<herospirit> You cannot comprehend the true form of Discord's attack! Fluttershy takes 247 damage. Fluttershy has fainted!
<Denied_Existence> 3Pinkie_Pie Then you'd better mod me
<Ziltoid> best scream
<Tweaky_Scribe> I came here to see what this is
<DuskShine> Most lesbian pictures are tame.
<Tweaky_Scribe> hahahahaha good one Herospirit
<prince-dari> Steven_Magnet is my bot.
<Synros> lolwat are you guys doing?
<Barry1> Discord used Shadow Sneak! Critical Hit! Dialga Fainted! You panicked and fled, dropping your money!
<prince-dari> It has my hostname.
<prince-dari> Derp.
<MeteorVenture> i don't like it all the same
<prince-dari> :P
<Denied_Existence> 3Hey dari
<Pinkie_Pie> Try talking now Prince-Dari
<prince-dari> Yeah?
<desertman2> Why are you working on a spreadsheet?
<Luna> 07hey steven!
<Denied_Existence> 3You in here?
<MeteorVenture> despite being tame.. in fact i really dislike it
<Denied_Existence> 3Pinkie's been telling us you will read a Val fic
<herospirit> I can't be the only one who thinks of Giygas when I hear Discord :P
<prince-dari> Didn't promise anything.
<prince-dari> Said I might.
<E_N> 7PINKIE Y U GIVE ADMIN
<prince-dari> Depends on what's in it.
<DuskShine> In fact, I'm pretty sure most of the pictures tagged lesbian on ponibooru could be found on bronibooru.
<E_N> 7STOP GIVING ADMIN
<E_N> 7GIVE OP
<DuskShine> They'd just lack the lesbian tag.
<Wrek> 05so uhm
<Denied_Existence> 3What would make it a no?
<Wrek> 05wuts goin on?
<DecapKing> 4http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/395e9a27fe9496cb9a79f7aedb026709/51701%20-%20Molestia%20artist%3AThe_Weaver%20pictures%20plot%20spike%20twilight_sparkle.png
<prince-dari> I'll tell you when I see it.
<Tweaky_Scribe> im actually new to this whole "Brony" community, and someone pointed me here... Do we just... Like, talk here? About everything and anything?
<RainBroDash> 10atm I'm sitting here craving food because I'm bored
<desertman2> We're waiting for someone
<Tweaky_Scribe> oh?
<Denied_Existence> 3Uh...well silverman is doing a CaramelxTrixieSeapony fic
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol E_N
<Ziltoid> we usally watch movies fridays and saturdays
<Denied_Existence> 3silvermane*
<E_N> Tweaky_Scribe we usually only talk about clopfics in here...
<Tweaky_Scribe> ooooh What movies?
<Denied_Existence> 3It will be a clopfiction
<Wrek> 05neato
<Barry1> Whatever we decide on the week before
<desertman2> NewDCD is supposed to be here soon
<Tweaky_Scribe> ahahahah clopfics. Specialized names for pony fanfics, thats just silly
<Ziltoid> we decide the movies trough a raffle
<Barry1> except for special occasions
<Dat_Pon-3> HAVE TUBA WILL TRAVEL
<Tweaky_Scribe> oooh
<herospirit> is there an Earthbound/Pony crossover yet?
<interior_gummy> allo
<Tweaky_Scribe> ok. whats next movie then?
<Denied_Existence> 3I am creating a Val x Wrek clopfiction. I will let Wrek decide on that one.
<FreezeFrame> Er, it's a specialized name for pony fapfics, not fanfics, Tweaky_Scribe
<DecapKing> 4http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/8818c1a3e1e08899a14621658e00b835/45972%20-%20Hush_Now_Quiet_Now%20fluttershy%20lullaby%20sniper_rifle.jpg
<Nittany_Tiger> Been forever since I've seen Swarm of the Century.
<Bmartin82> just sent the email
<Dat_Pon-3> a WTF moment there in every show
<Tweaky_Scribe> .....Oh Freeze.
<Ziltoid> rocky horror show and something else
<Barry1> Good question. What are they?
<DecapKing> 4AND I WILL LINK RANDOM PICS!!!
<Bmartin82> thank you for your time, FormalHavvy :)
<DuskShine> Your average "lesbian" picture on ponibooru is less "ponies having sex" and more "Rainbow Dash nibbling on somepony's ear".
<interior_gummy> anyway, down for gic before robot night?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Decap, give up on those pictures
<MeteorVenture> even her sniping ish graceful
<Ziltoid> or true romance
<E_N> HAHA he thought I meant all fics
<Dat_Pon-3> tonights robot night?
<E_N> that's funny
<Barry1> Rocky Horror Picture Show for B-Movie, and A-Movie is True Romance
<Bmartin82> have a good night
<Denied_Existence> 3So...what do you think of those two dari?
<Synros> don't feed dem parasprites
<Tweaky_Scribe> hey, cant blame a newb for being unknowing
<herospirit> Here there be monsters, Tweaky
<desertman2> What are the episodes?
<Dat_Pon-3> why isnt Rocky Horror A show!
<MeteorVenture> ya and i hate that stuff dusk.. i really do
<Tweaky_Scribe> eh, i can handle monsters
<interior_gummy> (and yes, people fap to ponies)
<prince-dari> As I said, depends on what's in it.
<FreezeFrame> Actually, we just talk about whatevs
<Dermathil> ZILTOID, PM
<DuskShine> *shrug* Okay.
<Tweaky_Scribe> (i know Interior)
<DuskShine> Seems irrational to me, but eh.
<Denied_Existence> 3That doesn't tell me much...
<Nittany_Tiger> There are no monsters in Rocky Horror Picture Show.
<Tweaky_Scribe> (*shudders*)
<Wrek> 05nnoooeeees
<Barry1> I like that
<Denied_Existence> 3It would be helpful if you told us what you DEFINITALLY wouldn't want
<Barry1> The moral of the story: Pinkie nPie is always right
<Denied_Existence> 3Please
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Duskshine, you think what we do in here is irrational?
<Tweaky_Scribe> this funky thing running in the stream right now is pretty awesome actua-Aw it ended.
<MeteorVenture> but i'm much more ok with the lesbian stuff than i am with R34
<DuskShine> ... what?
<Wrek> 05beat 6 levels with 100% kills, secrets and items. then suddenly the 7th map comes out with only 94%items
<Tweaky_Scribe> YAY ITS BACK
<Tweaky_Scribe> aw
<Barry1> Zombie Infestation?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Also, what are you doing here RainBroDash?
<Tweaky_Scribe> hehehehe
<DuskShine> Pinkie, were you following the same conversation as I was?
<Tweaky_Scribe> i actually want to see a zombie pony

<Pinkie_Pie> 13U BE SPYIN ON OUR OPERATIONZ
<Tweaky_Scribe> that could be an awesome plot
<herospirit> It was bad enough here, apparently, that Dari made the shippers make their own chat channel :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Filly, PA?
<Barry1> That was a subtitle
<DecapKing> 4damn links not working
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Im not sure DuskShine
<Tweaky_Scribe> though not exactly kid friendly
<DuskShine> I was talking about pictures being tagged "lesbian" on ponibooru, not... anything else.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Oh
<herospirit> I want to make a Ponyville L4D campaign.
<Synros> they could be...friendship zombies
<MeteorVenture> i was talking about the actual pictures
<Tweaky_Scribe> hehehehe, its amazing what a change G4 is compared to the earlier generations
<Nittany_Tiger> State Coltage, PA
<MeteorVenture> not just the tag
<Denied_Existence> 3Well considering things I have heard you read Dari...I can't think of what you WOULDNT want...
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Bad request?
<RainBroDash> 10lol
<Octavia> 14Ugh, dont mention food. I'm starving. And I wont have anything at all to eat until at least Tuesday. :(
<Pinkie_Pie> 13What is that supposed to mean..
<Tweaky_Scribe> ...I probably talk too much
<herospirit> If someone made a Ponville l4d campaign, who else here would play it? : D
<DecapKing> 4wait i requested something?
<E_N> 7His link was 400 bad request
<Synros> I
<Wrek> 05sound a bit harsh Octavia
<Wrek> 05:C
<Tweaky_Scribe> i would
<desertman2> I would
<prince-dari> What's with all you guys and your starving?
<Nittany_Tiger> I guess I would.
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/7lFFbT
<Pinkie_Pie> 13And thats a good reason to kick someone?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13>.>
<Barry1> never played L4D
<herospirit> Naw, Tweaky, you don't talk too much. Active chat is a good chat :P
<Tweaky_Scribe> oh that is good to know
<Synros> ok everypony shun Barry1
<E_N> 7Any reason is a good reason to kick
<Barry1> I didn't have the right system!
<Luna> 07geez
<Nittany_Tiger> Shuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunah
<Luna> 07that's horrible
<RainBroDash> 10dari I has no money
<Barry1> I'm a Nintendo Brony, anyway
<Octavia> 14How do you mean Wrek?
<Tweaky_Scribe> Shuuuuuun?
<desertman2> Barry1: Get L4D2 now!
<Tweaky_Scribe> Shun the nonebeliever?
<Synros> sssshhhhhhuuuunnnnnn
<Octavia> 14I have no money atm for food. x.x
<Barry1> If L4D is Microsoft, I might not get it, since I don't trust XBoX 360
<Synros> steal his kidney too
<Tweaky_Scribe> hahaha i dont have L4D2 either
<prince-dari> Ahh, the luxuries of being young and having parents pay for everything for you. :P
<Tweaky_Scribe> i have L4D
<desertman2> It's Valve
<RainBroDash> 10also, I tend to only eat when I should eat anyway. Saves money, burns fat-> win/win
<Octavia> 14Betch!
<RainBroDash> 10dari my parents are shit-poor XD
<Nittany_Tiger> L4D/L4D2 is on PC and 360.
<herospirit> It's available for the PC as well;
<RainBroDash> 10they're the ones that have no money atm
<Denied_Existence> 3Not really....
<Nittany_Tiger> I would get it on PC since the DLC on the PC is free.
<Nittany_Tiger> Plus mods.
<Octavia> 14I'm only 100 pounds, if I loose anymore weight, there wont be anything left...
<RainBroDash> 10I'm trying to live off them :<
<Synros> buy them on Steam for $20 each
<Barry1> Yeah, but I doubt my laptop's fast enough to get enough enjoyment from it
<herospirit> What Tiger said
<prince-dari> Well, you can always get them to do your laundry if they have no money.
<Denied_Existence> 3But if we want to run on that theory
<RandomExtra> Hopefully Your computer can run it well
*Pinkie_Pie 13is thinking that E_N is the one who banned Dari
<desertman2> Also, they're porting over the L4D1 campaigns to L4D2
<Pinkie_Pie> 13>.>
<Tweaky_Scribe> ...Wait, Artix Entertainment made a pony game???
<RainBroDash> 10I'm 11 stone, which is 154 pounds
<Tweaky_Scribe> what the heck am i reading
<Nittany_Tiger> Microsoft forced Valve to charge for 360 DLC.
<E_N> 7Actually, I had nothing to do with that
<Octavia> 14You be a lightweight too.
<Tweaky_Scribe> ...Whoops wrote out loud
<Wrek> 05which still doesnt make sense to me
<RainBroDash> 10but I've lost 24 pounds recently
<Barry1> not to mention it's too expensive right now, and I've already got a Wii on Layaway
<herospirit> I haven't actually tried the PC version though. Dunno if my comp could handle it
<E_N> 7I didn't even realize he was banned
<Dashite> Meh, if you've waited this long, wait till the next steam sale.
<Wrek> 05(bounds n stones that is)
<Octavia> 14I've always been really-small framed.
<herospirit> Tweaky, it's not actually MLP related
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/IndIj5
<Octavia> 14My mom is like 90-100 pounds and my dad is like 150
<RainBroDash> 10I'm a pretty big guy, or at least I always was
<Tweaky_Scribe> oh?
<prince-dari> It's weird, you don't sound like a big guy.
<Shiggy> my...
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't like Microsoft charging for MP. I never will.
<prince-dari> You're disembodied voice anyway.
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> Your*
<RainBroDash> 10well I'm not anymore XD
<Octavia> 14lol
<herospirit> I agree, Tiger.
<RainBroDash> 10and I guess I never was /that/ big
<Tweaky_Scribe> another question: Who is the stream runner
<Nittany_Tiger> I only play MP occasionally, so $5/month isn't worth it.
<herospirit> At least you can still do local/Lan MP though
<RainBroDash> 10but I was a couple pounds off 13 stone, with no muscle AT ALL
<Dashite> Sprinkles I think is streaming.
<Shiggy> XBL has a shitton of features though..
<DuskShine> MP?
<Octavia> 14One of those big 300 pound neckbeard guys? :P
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Hrm..
<RainBroDash> 10XD not quite
<desertman2> multiplayer
<Dashite> multiplayer
<Wrek> 05i suppose Rainbow dash gave RainBroDash a workout eh? :3
<Octavia> 14Haha
<DuskShine> Ah.
<Dashite> damn type...
<Dashite> typo*
<Nittany_Tiger> It does, but I could care less about the features.
<Dashite> >_<
<DuskShine> Do people seriously play Valve games on consoles?
<E_N> 7mfw I couldn't give it back
<Nittany_Tiger> I just want to play online.
<RainBroDash> 10Wrek.. Is it bad I have a fanfic for that?
<Octavia> 14Sounds hawt
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<herospirit> Blarglarg I'm off to the bathroom.
<Octavia> 14I want in on that action.
<Tweaky_Scribe> people do Duskshine
<Dashite> Only people that don't have a decent PC.
<Wrek> 05not really
<E_N> 7I just wanted to see if I could take it
<RainBroDash> 10ok fine, RD x RBD is canon anyway ;)
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not liking how PC gamers are being treated by other publishers right now.
<Nittany_Tiger> The large ones at least.
<Wrek> 05is it bad my fanfics are grimdark :o
<Octavia> 14:P
<E_N> A certain "Blizzard" comes to mind
<Dashite> Square is in my good books right now thanks to Deus Ex.
<Denied_Existence> Sadly there is no Dashite X Me fiction currently in existence...Internet, I am dissapoint
<Shiggy> PC games today = shitty ports
<MeteorVenture> btw i'm still playing earthbound zero
<DuskShine> Well, I can understand playing Valve games on the PS3 since the online there is free last I checked.
<Octavia> 14Is it bad I wont write fanfics?
<Octavia> 14*dont
<Dashite> Denied. :(
<DuskShine> But that was a recent development, wasn't it?
<Nittany_Tiger> PC games are gimped by DRM.
<MeteorVenture> i just have it open above this chat
<prince-dari> ^ No
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBroDash> 10not really, although when I do read fanfic (which, recently, isn't often), it's only ever exclusively shipping
<Shiggy> oh god
<Nittany_Tiger> Some of it draconian (Ubisoft).
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/ldirmz
<Shiggy> i remember i had GTA 4 on steak
<DuskShine> Oh gods, Ubisoft.
<Tweaky_Scribe> oh god DRM
<Shiggy> steam *
<Tweaky_Scribe> dont get me started on that shit
<Pinkie_Pie> 13@pony
<Dashite> DuskShine, will be interesting to see if the next valve PS3 game comes with a steam code as well.
<Steven_Magnet> 12Pinkie_Pie is 6Cheeri13lee
<Octavia> 14OH YEAH!
<Dashite> GTA4 on steak? Sounds tasty.
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/bQPUjp
<Octavia> 14I did get kinda inspired to write a short silly one though...
<DecapKing> 4@pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12DecapKing is 5Little Strong7heart
<Synros> that was a good song
<Nittany_Tiger> Plus install/activation limits.
<Shiggy> and had to login through steam, then go through GFWL, and finally Rockstar online to play the game... every single time
<Nittany_Tiger> Plus modding restrictions.
<E_N> 7We're gonna have to add Val to that list soon
<ponywithafez> damn im tired, see you guys next week
<Nittany_Tiger> Hmm.
<E_N> 7Also, I'm beginning to see why Steven was banned
<Tweaky_Scribe> Ooooh! Change the cars gravity or something to 9
<Octavia> 14RBD likes him sum shipping
<Tweaky_Scribe> and let them fly in GTA 4
<Nittany_Tiger> I have GTA 4 and all DLC on PC.
<Dashite> "Congrats on 4 million hits Eqd!" lol
<Tweaky_Scribe> so much fun to be had
<RainBroDash> !trivia-on
<RainBroDash> fffffff
*RainBroDash hides
<Nittany_Tiger> I used to have GTA4 on PC before my copy was stolen.
<RainBroDash> 10apparently so ;D
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't mind GFWL honestly.
<Pegacorn> Pega is back!
<E_N> 7suddenly Rainbro?
<Tweaky_Scribe> ARGH
*Tweaky_Scribe hides
*RainBroDash was not here
<Octavia> 14:P
<Nittany_Tiger> But having to log into three things seems much.
<desertman2> ?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13!trivia-on
<Nittany_Tiger> I truly believe PC gaming will go to the Indie crowd.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Rainbro has been here for a while
<Pegacorn> WWU remix?Kewl.
<Nittany_Tiger> And more customer-respective developers/publishers.
<MeteorVenture> "only my favorites" whoever wrote that.. i just hope they can't draw
*Denied_Existence 3can still see RainBroDash
<Nittany_Tiger> Meaning Activision, Ubisoft, and EA should just stop publishing PC games.

<Shiggy> Assassins Creed + shitty connection = fucking stupid
<Tweaky_Scribe> hehehe, what a weird thought, Indie becoming the true mainstream
<Tweaky_Scribe> I have never played assassins creed brotherhood online
<prince-dari> Lol RainBroDash
<prince-dari> Sneaky.
<prince-dari> Dat trivia
<Wrek> 05need to talk with DCD
<Shiggy> it doesnt matter if ur playing online or singleplayer
<Nittany_Tiger> I can't believe Ubisoft wants to bring back Always-on DRM.
<Wrek> 05his guides confuses tired Wrek
<Nittany_Tiger> Since everyone hated it online.
<Nittany_Tiger> *at first.
<Shiggy> assassins creed requires a constant internet connection to even play the game
<Octavia> 14Streaming guides?
<Nittany_Tiger> And all games afterwards.
<Shiggy> if ur internet cuts out for even a second the game autoexits
<Nittany_Tiger> Until Ubisoft patched it out.
<Shiggy> they did?
<Tweaky_Scribe> god DAMNIT ubisoft
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<Tweaky_Scribe> you are killing your fans
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft doesn't care.
<Shiggy> i uninstalled after i got annoyed with that
<Tweaky_Scribe> well not literally
<Tweaky_Scribe> but that is the next step
<Tweaky_Scribe> literal killing
<Wrek> 05yesh
<Denied_Existence> 3Do you approve of our attempt to destroy ValtheJean's sanity RainBroDash?
<desertman2> The main problem with that type of DRM is that if the servers are gone, the game becomes unplayable
<Tweaky_Scribe> i suspect them to start sending hired agents to kill us if we drop the internet soat
<Tweaky_Scribe> soap*
<DuskShine> isn't there some way to get around that?
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft is telling PC players that they hate them by using always-on DRM.
<Shiggy> doesnt from dust require a constant connection?
<desertman2> With piracy, yes
<Nittany_Tiger> It did.
<DuskShine> I mean, I don't condone piracy, but you could probably crack the DRM without resorting to theft.
<RainBroDash> 10my dog went out and unearthed a bone from the garden came into my room and sat on my feet and started eating it, then fell asleep sat on my feet with a bone in front of his face
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<Pegacorn> LITTERAL KILLING,THEN RE-ANIMATION.
<Nittany_Tiger> And Ubisoft never told anyone about it.
<prince-dari> LOL
<Tweaky_Scribe> YES, UBISOFT'S UNDEAD NERD ARMY WILL BURN THE GLOBE
*RainBroDash can't hear you because RainBroDash isn't here
<Tweaky_Scribe> THEIR WORLD DOMINANCE SHALL SOON BE WITHIN GRASP

<desertman2> Actually, the problem was that someone said it wouldn't

<Octavia> 14Ah, okay. I wish I could stream kinda. But gotta wait. >.<
<Shiggy> honestly, if a game requires DRM like that i just wont buy it
<Pegacorn> HERBERT WEST WILL HAVE TO SAVE US WITH HIS OWN ARMY OF UNDEAD PEEPS.
<RainBroDash> 10trololo..
<Denied_Existence> Ohai Pegacorn, you missed Bjornfot
<Tweaky_Scribe> ...Wait who is Herbert
<E_N> OHAI AWESOME SONG
<Nittany_Tiger> They put DRM in they said wouldn't be in.
<Octavia> 14lol XD
<Wrek> 05ever since we sat up wircd my connection's been having hiccups :P
<RainBroDash> 10today I managed to get my phone to work as a webcam for my PC
<DuskShine> Herbert West, the Re-Animator.
<Nittany_Tiger> And I hope Ubisoft gets punished for it.
<Tweaky_Scribe> Nittany: Scumbag Ubisoft: Wont put in DRM, Does so anyways.
<Pegacorn> Ninja'd DuskShine.
*Shiggy is disappoint with the current state of PC games
<Denied_Existence> 3Sorry RainBroDash, the topic doesn't lie.
<RainBroDash> 10which means I now have a decent webcam, whether for attempting streaming, or skype, or w/e
*Tweaky_Scribe is too
<Nittany_Tiger> Same.
<DuskShine> There was actually this one SRPG for the 360 that referenced that.
<Tweaky_Scribe> humm??
<Tweaky_Scribe> references what?
<DuskShine> His name was Herbert East, and he was the only character in the entire game who could revive your team mates.
<Nittany_Tiger> And I totally hate how Activision is ruining all gaming with their supergreed.
<Octavia> 14Cool RBD
<desertman2> What game?
<Pegacorn> Proof that H.P Lovecraft lives on.
<Octavia> 14Everyone has fancy phones lately. I have.... an old Razr :<
<DuskShine> Can't recall, but it was a WW2 SRPG.

<DuskShine> Among other things, Hitler had vampires on his side.
<RainBroDash> 10mine didn't cost anything, because I'm on a contract though
<DuskShine> And werewolves were members of the allied forces.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari still here?

<Pinkie_Pie> @pony The pony hiding in Herospirit's room
<prince-dari> In another plot clearly lifted from members off of MI6's Most-Wanted list, scientists at MIT have worked out that if you inject tiny gold rods into tumors you can blow them away. The micro-jewellery strongly absorbs infrared laser beams, which can be passed through the body and focused on the maBLINGnant growth.

<prince-dari> Maryland engineers are building a hunting/killing machine that tracks down breast malignancies, perhaps by taking a photo of a tumor and writing "Sarah Connor" underneath it in marker. The robot is built to live inside Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems and will bring swift electric death to what ails you.

<Barry1> HI, AJ!!
<interior_gummy> this gator's been gettin' all the fillies
<Applejack> Howdy there, pardner ^^
<prince-dari> When chemotherapy or radiotherapy don't work, why not turn to some nice friendly Clostridia bacteria? Because the family Clostridia includes things like botulism and tetanus?
<Tweaky_Scribe> i thought i was the lucky one?
<Luna> 07RBD did you see it?
<Pegacorn> APPLECEST IS IN HERE.
<Denied_Existence> 3I am tired and sad...
<prince-dari> These cellular secret agents can sneak into the heart of clumps of cancer cells, start replicating and can deploy a pre-installed genetic payload which generally ruins the tumor's whole entire day. The bacteria then presumably stroll out of the exploding tumor to bang the hot bacterial babe it met earlier in the film. They certainly aren't immediately killed by big doses of antibiotics (that's no way to end a movie).
<Applejack> what yall saw today?
<Barry1> that's not nice, pega
<Tweaky_Scribe> hummmm... Maybe i should change my name to Lucky_Scribe?

<herospirit> Tiger, when you reach level four, you will weep
*Applejack starts watching Mulan for whatever reason...
<Octavia> 14Since you do the banners and art for the site.
<Denied_Existence> 3>Implying that dari isn't awesome
<Applejack> :#
<DecapKing> 4>implying this is a toaster
<Applejack> :3
<interior_gummy> herospirit: me and big mac are the rival pimps of all of ponyville
<Octavia> 14I guess though the only thing we'd have to communicate on is sizes. :P
<Applejack> Big Mac?
<herospirit> 15>implying I am FOREVER ALONE
<Applejack> hmmm..nah
<Nittany_Tiger> This might make me want to play Adventure Quest again.

<Denied_Existence> 3>Implying fanfiction isn't crazy
<Denied_Existence> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/115.png
<Applejack> xD
<Applejack> LIKE A BAWS
<Ramirez> liek a baws indeed.
<interior_gummy> shut up applejack or i'll tell everyone about your time with braeburn...wait, already did ;)
<Applejack> >=C
<herospirit> Tiger, remember, every single Atrix game is a trap to separate you from your cash
<Octavia> 14Though... someone here was making sites decently lately, can't remember who though....
<prince-dari> On a related note, I found the nicest beer I've ever had recently.
<Denied_Existence> 3Sorry, I believe I just won the internet.
<Wrek> 05who?
<prince-dari> >implying I've tried that many beers
<Nittany_Tiger> They did that years ago with AQ.
<prince-dari> But still.
<herospirit> 15Nope, cuz your pc dissapeared
<Applejack> Bdat wasn't meh, it was my evil twin!!
<prince-dari> Of the ones I've tried this is king.
<interior_gummy> come play, my lord
<herospirit> 15pic*
<Nittany_Tiger> I have a guardian account.
<prince-dari> Affligem beer.
<SirSprinkles> 6YOU'VE GOT MAIL
<Denied_Existence> 3Looks fine on my end
<herospirit> :0
<Denied_Existence> 3Just click it
<Nittany_Tiger> Pretty sweet. I have the Blade of Awe, but I rarely use it.
<prince-dari> Those monks have been working on it for 1000 years and they've got it RIGHT.
<herospirit> 15There's nothing there to click for me
<Denied_Existence> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/115.png
<herospirit> 15vanished again.
<Denied_Existence> 3Or if you prefer link version
<Nittany_Tiger> Since it changes elements.
<Denied_Existence> 3http://miburl.com/0BsuUX
<Applejack> xD
<herospirit> 15very nice :p
<Denied_Existence> 3And if it doesn't appear, just click where it should be
<Applejack> i want Fighting is Magic :C
<herospirit> I know right, Applejack? :0
<RainBroDash> 10meh, I don't like beer really
<Applejack> eeyup...ya saw frahday
<Applejack> stream?
<herospirit> WHY IS THIS SONG SO GOOD.
<Applejack> DAT ENTER ¬¬
<interior_gummy> missed the stream, what are the characters?
<herospirit> Yes I did Applejack :3
<Denied_Existence> 3Meanwhile I continue to be ignored by RainBroDash and Dari at the same time
<Applejack> =D
<herospirit> They only have the Mane 6 confirmed
<Applejack> eeyup
<Denied_Existence> 3X2 INGNORANCE COMBO!!!!
<prince-dari> Then you clearly haven't tried this beer.
<prince-dari> :P
<herospirit> and they only showed Twilight and AJ
<Applejack> and Twilight is cheap...
<DecapKing> 4meanwhile i continue to listen to The Beast and the Harlot
<Ziltoid> lol cheap
<herospirit> There are 17 spaces, so 11 open.
<desertman2> Is there a recording of the stream yet?
<Applejack> is it..
<Denied_Existence> 3*Headdesk*
<Applejack> she teleports and shoots a gigantic beamu
<herospirit> At least one of those is confirmed to be a non Pony.
<Denied_Existence> 3sjalf;haibo;ficoad;s
<E_N> 7>implying one can win the internet
<Applejack> yes
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright dari, I registered it, but it'll apparently take a day to process.
<Dermathil> probably Gilda
<Applejack> desertman
<Denied_Existence> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/115.png
<interior_gummy> lemme guess, spike
<Dermathil> also, Trixie
<RainBroDash> 10I drink beer and ale often because I kinda have to. I drink kopparberg strawberry and lime cider because it tastes like those strawberry tube-like freeze pop things
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Dermathil> Gilda would fit more in a fighting game than the baby dragon
<Applejack> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/fighting-is-magic-livestream-recording.html
<herospirit> We don't know. The Mane 6 is all that's confirmed.
<Applejack> there
<prince-dari> Lime cider?
<Applejack> the whole recordin
<prince-dari> The fuck.
<Dermathil> also, hitboxes could be closer with gilda than with spike
<prince-dari> Nevermind, I can't talk.
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<herospirit> And I don't see why everyone thinks Twi is broken. :0
<RainBroDash> 10well it's cider
<RainBroDash> 10with 'a hint of strawberry and lime'
<DuskShine> ... welp, I think I just had my world rocked.
<RainBroDash> 10but it tastes like really sugary sweet freeze pops
<Denied_Existence> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/375.png
<Solarboy> She has low HP, pretty much like Taokaka from BlazBlue
<Applejack> herospirit: She teleports, shoots gigantic beams, use "mines" and most of her attacks are long ranged...
<RainBroDash> 10and just tastes of strawberry. nothing else
<DuskShine> I found out somebody hates the Derpy/Dinky fanon relationship.
<RainBroDash> 10not even alcohol
<prince-dari> What, like WKD?
<DecapKing> 4you really suck at posting pics DE
<Solarboy> And 3 hits and she dies.
<Denied_Existence> 3!?
<DuskShine> Not "is indifferent to" or "doesn't care about".
<MirrorImage> the only reason Twilight appears broken is because her style is to keep her opponent somewhat at a distance
<herospirit> but if you close the distance you can completely fuck her shit up :3
<DuskShine> Actually hates it.
<Applejack> Solarboy: nope O.o
<Denied_Existence> 3All my pics are coming up Decap
<E_N> 7I like the name Ditzy better than Derpy
<RainBroDash> Denied_existence, yfw no longer ignored
<MirrorImage> while her only competition has been Applejack - an in-your-face fighter
<RainBroDash> what's p?
<RainBroDash> up*?
<Denied_Existence> 3None of them are links
<Octavia> 14And Wrek I was talking about you. :P
<interior_gummy> spike basically is a main character
<Dermathil> Rarity can probably do both
<RainBroDash> 10not really dari, not that sweet
<Solarboy> Indeed Mirror
<E_N> 7RainbroDash yfw you're not hidden
<DecapKing> 4they dont show up at all
<DuskShine> I like the name Ditzy better too, but people understand right away what I'm referring to when I say Derpy.
<Dermathil> remember the bitchslap move?
<Applejack> ye
<RainBroDash> 10and significantly more manly
<Applejack> xD
<Octavia> 14Since you're our banner artist and such. I mean if I was working on the site design. Since Luna said we could work together. :P
<prince-dari> >manly
*RainBroDash is talking to D_E from under the table
<prince-dari> >children's drink
<prince-dari> :P
<Denied_Existence> 3I am tired RBD. Sathi is keeping me in the dark and I am starting to feel like she didn't boot me out of the chat to discuss me...
*RainBroDash has no idea how E_N can see him
<Wrek> 05i passed otu for a minute there
<Wrek> 05ohai
<Denied_Existence> 3IDK
<Ziltoid> Gummy has to be playable
<RainBroDash> D_E I can't really comment
<Ziltoid> Or I will rage
<herospirit> Lol :3
<Octavia> 14lol :P
<Applejack> xD
<RainBroDash> I don't know what's in her head, and it's not my place to criticise
<Purple`Prose> Rainbow Dash will probably be aerial rushdown
<Denied_Existence> 3I didn't think you could
<E_N> 7So they're leaving you in the dark because of one kick?
<herospirit> And all you can do is a 1 damage bite attack :3
<RainBroDash> no, I mean on a personal level
<RainBroDash> adnasdfn
<Applejack> Gummy will prob be part of one of Pinkie's Attacks
<Purple`Prose> Anyone jumps at her, they'll likely die
<RainBroDash> and also E_N don't speculate
<MirrorImage> Gummy probably WILL be pinkie's attacks
<RainBroDash> <3
<MirrorImage> similar to Twilight's book
<Denied_Existence> 3E_N also cause I'm kinda eccentric
*Applejack brohoofs MirrorImage
<RainBroDash> 10yes dari, exactly
*MirrorImage brohoofs Applejack
<RainBroDash> 10more manly
<RainBroDash> 10scrub
<Purple`Prose> Pinkie will probably also use lots of stuff like party poppers, balloons, streamers...
<Solarboy> Yeah, that makes more sense
<RainBroDash> basically, D_E was just a little bit trigger-happy and a tad loopy
<Purple`Prose> I want to see the CMC as one character
<Wrek> 05confound these ponies, they drive me to art
<MirrorImage> i could see that too - though the question is whether Pinkamena will be a separate character
<Denied_Existence> 3I guess I am just kinda lonely, in the same boat (Or a similar one) as Hipster.
<RainBroDash> pah.
<Purple`Prose> Three little fillies ganging up to fight off the older girls
<Applejack> Solarboy: its PINKIE PIE...nothing makes sense, sugarcube...
<Octavia> 14Wrek I know that feel
<Denied_Existence> 3He's pretty sad, but I can't tell you why. Patient confidentiality you know.
<Dat_Pon-3> answer MADIC!
<Dat_Pon-3> MAGIC
<Applejack> i don't get it...why they call emo Pinkie, Pinkamena?
<E_N> 7(not criticising) it seems like Bronystate said, hey lets get some new mods, then had people apply to be their bitches
<RainBroDash> D_E, really don't care :L
<MirrorImage> because Pinkamena was her name back on the rock farm
<Applejack> Pinkamena is part of Pinkie's full name...
<Denied_Existence> 3Good
<MirrorImage> when her default mood was emo-Pinkie
<Solarboy> And she was all ):
<herospirit> Except they're only using characters from the show, so I don't know if they'd use fanon about chars like Pinkamena and Derpy
<Purple`Prose> Because Pinkamena was her name when she was a sad little filly on the rock farm
<Denied_Existence> 3He doesn't want people bugging him about it anyway
<RainBroDash> E_N, well great. That's your opinion bro. Turns out not all opinions are right ;)
<interior_gummy> i would be a playable character, but i chose to be a lover, not a fighter
<Dat_Pon-3> well pinkamena is her actual name
<Applejack> exatly..
<interior_gummy> fun fact: fluttershy is into bdsm
<herospirit> THAT BOY NEEDS THERAPY.
<Dat_Pon-3> pinkie is lie her nickname
<Ziltoid> http://i.imgur.com/rrVTa.gif
<interior_gummy> stay the fuck away from her
<Applejack> she calls herself Pinkie cuz it's shorter i guess =P
<Dat_Pon-3> like*
<Purple`Prose> brb
<MirrorImage> speaking of fluttershy - what would her move set be like?
<Dat_Pon-3> a lil nickname
<E_N> 7I mean, all new mods are half-op and are given no REAL powers
<Purple`Prose> She would likely use Angel
<E_N> 7Why ask for new mods if that's all you'll give?
<RainBroDash> yeah, because they're tested for a while
<Purple`Prose> and summon little friends to help
<Solarboy> Animals
<DecapKing> she would call out a bear or something
<Solarboy> lots of animals
<RainBroDash> to see if they can hold their own
<Ziltoid> That would be so awesome *Dashface*
<interior_gummy> playlist over, wanna watch gic?
<Dat_Pon-3> her STARE HAS TO BE A MOVE!
<MirrorImage> i could see the animal swarms as her super moves
<RainBroDash> D_E is a prime example of this, he needs some tweaking :)
<Purple`Prose> Animals for specials, Angel for her regular attacks
<RainBroDash> not to be rude dude, please stop me if you think I'm overstepping the mark
<herospirit> Is the streamer online? :0
<Purple`Prose> BUNNY STAMPEDE
<Applejack> Dat_Pon-3: The Stare will prob be the lv-3 spacial
<SirSprinkles> 6Why does this playlist keep turning shuffle off?
<Denied_Existence> 3Don't worry E_N, RBD is a cool guy
<prince-dari> RainBro, you don't have to explain anything to him.
<herospirit> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT BOY NEEDS THERAPY.
<MirrorImage> eheh... itt lv3-super speculations
<Denied_Existence> 3I trust him completely
<MirrorImage> twilight turns the opponent into a cactus
<RainBroDash> prince-dari to whom?
<herospirit> damn songs stuck in my head.
<E_N> 7I like RBD
<Purple`Prose> What about Trixie?
<prince-dari> E_N
<E_N> 7and Dari
<E_N> 7and most mods
<DecapKing> 4i trust nobody
<Purple`Prose> Trixie would probably be close-range control
<RainBroDash> Oh, yeah I'm only doing so because I'm choosing to
<Purple`Prose> as well as Anti-air
<MirrorImage> Trixie's level 3 would be smoke and mirrors, totally
<MirrorImage> "look! the ursa major!" (not)
<RainBroDash> I feel like he's a reasonable guy who's got the wrong end of the stick
<RainBroDash> ^^
<Denied_Existence> 3Also Dari, those angels were fucking creepy.
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<prince-dari> Dem angels.
<Purple`Prose> No, her Level 3 would be her Stage
<Dat_Pon-3> DJ Pon-3 will be a playable character?
<DecapKing> 4there were angels?
<prince-dari> :)
<Solarboy> Nobody knows
<MirrorImage> wouldn't doubt it pon-3
<herospirit> I'm hoping they just use the Twilight Eyes and some kind of epic blast for Twi's lvl 3 hyper.
<MirrorImage> what were there? 12 locked slots on the livestream?
<interior_gummy> give her time...
*Applejack is now Away
<herospirit> 11
<Purple`Prose> Twilight's Level Three would probably be the Elements of Harmony
<herospirit> there will be 17 chars total.
<MirrorImage> so then lets see...
<Dat_Pon-3> twilight will bitch slap you with a book
<Solarboy> And then there may be more
<Solarboy> as they think of more
<Dat_Pon-3> Sonic Rainboom is Dash special should be
<Denied_Existence> 3But yeah...just getting kinda lonely, feeling like the black sheep with nothing to do...
<herospirit> I have a strange habit of calling Lvl ones "supers" and Lvl threes "ultras"
<prince-dari> Hey D_E.
<RainBroDash> meh, do something else then :P
<prince-dari> YFW this gif: http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss148/emmzlife/Doctor%20Who/Angels.gif
<herospirit> 15Talk with us in the main chat D_E
<herospirit> 15:0
<Purple`Prose> probably Dash's Level 3
<Purple`Prose> brb
<GGgala> >mfw Blink was so awesome we watched it twice
<prince-dari> >three times
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh gosh
<GGgala> imokaywiththis
<MirrorImage> dash's lv3 is the rainboom - obviously
<DecapKing> 4whats creepy about that?
<MirrorImage> that will be the worst kept secret they have and there will be plenty of rage if they don't
<Denied_Existence> What you want me to talk about herospirit?
<Dat_Pon-3> there gonna have a super bar when i saw them play there was nothing like that
<GGgala> btw dari, جيگرتو بخورم!!
<sotha> Um. . . What the buck? Now it's working for ME?!
<Ziltoid> I love flutterage so much
<prince-dari> O_o
<Dat_Pon-3> but this is really what im wondering
<RainBroDash> D_E, PM
<Dat_Pon-3> When is the game coming out any word?
<E_N> 7Oui, zat is correct madam
<MirrorImage> Dat_Pon-3: it was that bar at the bottom
<herospirit> We're talking about Fighting is Magic at the moment :0
<MirrorImage> as to when - no word
<herospirit> THERE IS TOO A WORD
<herospirit> "soon"
<MirrorImage> the super bar wasn't very obvious, but it was down there regardless yesterday
<herospirit> They used it every single time someone asked :P
<interior_gummy> can we just watch gic? :P
<GGgala> (that is what you said, right?)
<herospirit> Gummy, is the streamer even here?
<sotha> You know what?! I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but my browser somehow. . . works. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean its not true.
<herospirit> I think it's just a playlist set to random
<Dat_Pon-3> schizophrenic pie
<interior_gummy> no idea
<Denied_Existence> No interior_gummy, we will never watch gig. No matter how much you beg
*DuskShine A few days ago I was reading a discussion about the use of stronger words as a response to an indiferent environment (the internet). They argued it led to the overuse of words like "rape" and "nazi", as hyperboles, which itself led to more desensitization.
<MirrorImage> 0_o
<sotha> GIC?
<FreezeFrame> All of my hatred for the Temple of Time in Twilight Princess
<MirrorImage> hello random Queen
<E_N> 7desemsitization is always good
<herospirit> I really want the main music them from "Frontier Psychiatrist" seperated from the rest
<Dermathil> LOL
<Dermathil> DAT ADVERT
<Dermathil> LOOOOOOOOK
<DuskShine> Somebody said that in response to my surprise about the whole "that one person hates the derpy/dinky fanon relationship" thing.
<Dermathil> G3
<sotha> herospirit: I love that song!
<Dat_Pon-3> lol
<Ziltoid> OH GOD
<FappingTurtle> what is mibbit
<Ziltoid> PONCEPTION
<Dat_Pon-3> thats awesome
<DuskShine> I'm going to assume that's what happened, the person just used "hate" when they meant "doesn't care about" or something similar.
<Dermathil> guys, those ads are alive.
<MirrorImage> a pony within a pony? you mean Nightmare Moon?
<MeteorVenture> i actually had that discussion with a friend of mine earlier.. i was talking about how there was no word to use for something that is actually amazing anymore.. every single one is overused
<interior_gummy> dat pony ad
<herospirit> Any idea if they have that creepy instrumental of their's anywhere? :P
<interior_gummy> also
<interior_gummy> i
<Monxrch> um
<interior_gummy> think
<interior_gummy> that
<interior_gummy> brony
<interior_gummy> movie
<interior_gummy> night
<interior_gummy> next
<interior_gummy> week
<interior_gummy> will
<Dermathil> I got LOTRO ads during the marathon and Dark Knight Toy ads during the DK movie
<interior_gummy> be
<sotha> I do not know herospirit
<MeteorVenture> so none have a strong meaning anymore
<Dermathil> HAHAHAH
<Dermathil> he had it coming
<interior_gummy> spamming
<Dat_Pon-3> lol
<interior_gummy> is really
<SirSprinkles> 6...lawl
<E_N> 7Even with Desensitization, hate still doesn't mean "doesn't care about"
<interior_gummy> fun
<interior_gummy> and
<interior_gummy> you
<MirrorImage> of course he did dermathil
<interior_gummy> should
<RainBroDash> yeah, shit like 'epic'
<E_N> 7They're two different things
<interior_gummy> try
<interior_gummy> it
<DecapKing> 4 4what حول العضو التناسلي النسوي؟
*Dermathil slaps interior_gummy
<DuskShine> I know, E_N.
<Ziltoid> no
<Ziltoid> gummy
<Ziltoid> your

<Octavia> 14:D
<SirSprinkles> 6*leaves*
<E_N> 7http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/435
<DuskShine> But the idea of somebody actually -hating- that fanon strikes me as... I don't even know.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13My Fallout 3 no longer launches, I dont have the disk to reinstall
<DuskShine> I'm genuinely dumbfounded.
<MeteorVenture> but used much more jokingly of course
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Basically its not even showing in the list of installed programs
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Any idea how I can fix it?
<Dashite> Ziltoid can't grammar.
<DuskShine> No idea outside of pirating, Pinkie. Sorry. =/
<Ziltoid> trolololol
<Dermathil> THANKS guys!
<Dat_Pon-3> ENCORE!

<desertman2> What is this?
<DuskShine> To make a long story short: I can't write when I'm depressed and one of the things that depresses me is being unable to write.

<herospirit> I have a side job writing for JRPG villains
<DecapKing> 4how many do you have selected for use with FO3?
<Octavia> 14That anime girl on the far left kinda reminds me of a character from Rozen Miaden.

<herospirit> DeathSmiles? What's it for?
<SirSprinkles> 6It used to be an old arcade game.
<SirSprinkles> 6You can find it for Xbox.
<SirSprinkles> 6...and I think PS3.
<herospirit> I'll remember that.
<SirSprinkles> 6I have the Limited Edition. Comes with an Xbox faceplate and the soundtrack.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Not sure

<herospirit> SirSprinkles: Someone's making a Ponified Fire Emblem. They need sprite artists
<AgentShawn> I demand Fuck Shit Stack.

<JewelsFriend> Just once, i'd like to join one of these streams, and have the events make sense.
<Octavia> 14I'm awesome!
<interior_gummy> 0i would try to gain leverage over the humans
<herospirit> They give you a few templates, you make at least two of the portraits they need and send them in. The best part?
<AgentShawn> Like a boss?
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I approve of Ponified Fire Emblem.
<AgentShawn> Really?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13...
<AgentShawn> Like a LAGGY INTERNETS.

<TwilightSparkle> This music should play in the final battle in fighting is magic
<Denied_Existence> I know this song though, it has lyrics about luna

<DSNesmith> the servers are dead
<CHAENNE> shit logged on for a quick second to ask a question and now i have to see all 26 episodes over again for the ninth time
<Baz> I never got Crysis cause I used to have a crappy 8500GT
<TrollightSparkle> I play on Crysis wars
<CHAENNE> this music video...
<TrollightSparkle> I have an 8800GT, it works fine.
<TrollightSparkle> On low/med :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I wish for more SP-focused FPSs.
<DSNesmith> I had an 8800 it worked well
<Baz> Recently upgraded to a GTX 460, but Crysis hasn't been on sale since I upgraded
<DSNesmith> but then it had a heat death
<Nittany_Tiger> Tired of MP focus.
<DSNesmith> yeah, I've got a 460 now
<DSNesmith> I love it
<Baz> And Steam has spoiled me, I don't like getting games that aren't on sale lol
<TrollightSparkle> I'ma be upgrading to an x3 and radeon hd 6870 soon :)
<Shiggy> Nittany_Tiger: try out Amnesia
<DSNesmith> hah, poor Baz, I got the Maximum Game pack on sale during the summer event
<DSNesmith> all three games for like 40 bucks
<Shiggy> its not a shooter but its cool
<TrollightSparkle> I've had the max edition since.. 08?
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, I've pre-ordered Dead Island.
<Nittany_Tiger> I have Amnesia.
<Nittany_Tiger> I miss when CoD was story-driven.
<TrollightSparkle> Lol CoD
<DSNesmith> CoD used to be really cool
<TrollightSparkle> Grrr CoD :(
<Denied_Existence> Yeah...
<Nittany_Tiger> Now it's a MP mess.
<DSNesmith> anyone rmember that part in CoD... 1?
<Baz> What I really want now is Assassin's Creed Brother, I'm a bit late in that franchise
<DSNesmith> with the car
<Shiggy> which part?
<DSNesmith> where you and your squad take a car through german territory
<Denied_Existence> Oh this.
<DecapKing> i miss when CoD used to take skill ot be good in
<TrollightSparkle> The only CoD game I played before MW was CoD2 Big Red One

<TrollightSparkle> I'm one of the shotgun wookies you see running around lol
<Shiggy> my solution to snipers in BC2 usually involved a tank
<Dashite> lol
<DecapKing> i was pretty much like a contersniping king in BC2 lol
<Dashite> >_>
<VioletVanilla> XDD
<Nittany_Tiger> But, again, I'm poor at MP shooters.
<DecapKing> i would be able to go something like 30-2
<Nittany_Tiger> You should see me play.
<TrollightSparkle> My solution to snipers? Tracer dart and Carl Gustav TROLOLOLOL
<VioletVanilla> Trollight do you have Sabot rounds yet?
<Baz> I'm only good at TF2 lol
<TrollightSparkle> Of course, rank 35 :)
<Denied_Existence> back with ice-cream in tow
<VioletVanilla> CLOSET CARL!!! <#
<VioletVanilla> <3*
<DecapKing> im only rank 31 or something
<TrollightSparkle> Always use the sabot rounds and snipe people, leaving them like wtf?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm rank 13.
<VioletVanilla> XDD
<VioletVanilla> I do it too Trollight
<TrollightSparkle> I'm pretty sure people are like, he sniped me.. with a shotgun?
<Baz> Haha what
<VioletVanilla> And when I had my mic I'd laugh
<DecapKing> but i just snipe using the M95
<VioletVanilla> and people would be like
<VioletVanilla> I GOT KILLED
<TrollightSparkle> You guys play on PC though?

<TrollightSparkle> NO
<VioletVanilla> M95 <333
<DecapKing> it wouldnt be legal but wtf ever
<TrollightSparkle> GOL.
<Octavia> 14Oh Fluttershy, I already love you~
<DecapKing> M95!
<Dashite> I didn't play more than an hour or two of multi, but I did play on PC.
<VioletVanilla> GOL is accurate I'll give it that
<TrollightSparkle> GOL /chat
<Baz> They ruined the AN-94 in BC2 :V
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep. Only person that hates/sucks at BF games.
<Nittany_Tiger> perma-sucks.
<Natleyn> There's a movie called Appaloosa in half an hour...
<Natleyn> Not sure if want
<TrollightSparkle> Psh AN-94 they say.
<TrollightSparkle> F2000 and AUG FTW :P
<DecapKing> i was always the person to shoot down the helicopters on island using the AT4
<VioletVanilla> I already do Fluttershy <3
<Baz> Movie description?
<VioletVanilla> Awww, well, let's not leave Nittany out. . .
<VioletVanilla> What games do you like NT? o:
<DecapKing> Bolt Action Sniper rifles <3
<Nittany_Tiger> The last MP game I enjoyed was UT2K4.
<Natleyn> (2008) The arrival of an attractive widow complicates the attempts of two lawmen to bring a malevolent rancher to justice.
<VioletVanilla> UT2K4
<Baz> I prefer fully automatic sniper rifles lololol
<VioletVanilla> REMUS
<VioletVanilla> REDEEMER
<Nittany_Tiger> I loved Assault and Onslaught.
<VioletVanilla> INFINITE AMMO
<VioletVanilla> <3
<DecapKing> seriously though some of the things that i could do counted as marksman kills too easily
<Octavia> 14Scoot Scoootalooooo~
<Natleyn> OH GOD THAT SPONSORED VIDEO
<Nittany_Tiger> Didn't care about dying. Just had fun.
<TrollightSparkle> Have you tried the VSS with ACOG in BC2? It's pretty much TROLOLOLOL
<DSNesmith> do he-man sings
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, maybe I had my days.
<DSNesmith> it's glorious
<Natleyn> He-man!
<DecapKing> like getting a headshot across the map through foliage
<DecapKing> im doubting that is really marksman worthy
<VioletVanilla> XD
<DSNesmith> also, nice most visited sites
<Baz> Oh god
<Baz> This song
<Veewave> afk
<DSNesmith> oh crap this song
<Denied_Existence> Yay Viva la Vida
<Natleyn> Oh lawd.
<Dark_Heart> this works so welll
<Octavia> 14That was when I ruled the worrrrrld...
<Baz> Heard it
<TrollightSparkle> Yay
<Denied_Existence> OH GOD THE BUFFER
<DecapKing> >i actually like this song
<Baz> Far too many times
<TrollightSparkle> FFFUUU
<VioletVanilla> This is a nice song. . .
<Baz> I used to like it
<DSNesmith> wow this really does work
<Baz> But I've just heard it too many times
*Octavia 14likes this song too
<DecapKing> i havent
<DSNesmith> I had to PLAY this
<Natleyn> So many friends don't like this anymore because it was overplayed
<DSNesmith> for orchestra one year
<DSNesmith> totally ruined it for me
<TrollightSparkle> Same here Baz, I used to listen to stuff all the time and hate it afterwards.. but I still have a soft spot for this song.
<DSNesmith> coldplay right
<Baz> Yep
<Denied_Existence> This is one of my 3 fav coldplay songs
<Baz> Coldplay is...
<Baz> I dunno, they're alright
<Dark_Heart> All hail the Lunar Republic
<DSNesmith> the only one of their songs I like unreservedly
<Nittany_Tiger> Ugh.
<TrollightSparkle> Ik
<DSNesmith> is the one with the epic piano riff
<TrollightSparkle> I'm sort of "meh" towards Coldplay, except for this song.
<Nittany_Tiger> I hate complaining about MP shooters. Sorry about that.
<DSNesmith> gah what's it called
<DSNesmith> um
<Natleyn> It's okay.
<VioletVanilla> Ish otay Nittany_Tiger <3 No harm done
*Natleyn pats Nittany
<TrollightSparkle> Eh, everybody hates MP shooters at times
<Dermathil> wat
<DSNesmith> um, wow, fail, I can't think of the name of that song
<DecapKing> SirSprinkles can we have some Are You Dead Yet next?
<Nittany_Tiger> I hate them most of the time now.
*VioletVanilla wraps her forehooves around Nittany in a hug
<Dermathil> how did my mibbit self-terminate?
<SirSprinkles> 6Maybe.
<TrollightSparkle> Just don't be like me and start throwing your controllers around XD
<Denied_Existence> The other two are Violet Hill and A Rush Of Blood To The Head
<Nittany_Tiger> You'll have to see me play.
<Denied_Existence> I <3
<Baz> Oy
<Baz> I broke so many controllers as a child >_>
<Natleyn> If I feel terrible enough to play a MP shooter, I go for Warrock
<Nittany_Tiger> Just the frustration I face turns games I want to love into ones I hate.
<Baz> And have broken so many computers as a teen
<Baz> :V
<Natleyn> Bad experience to the max.
<DecapKing> i never broke any controllers
<Baz> This one time though
<DecapKing> i did break a laptop though
<Baz> I was playing Need For Speed, can't remember which one
<Nittany_Tiger> CoD: Killstreak rape.
<Baz> But anywho
<TrollightSparkle> Funny story about laptops..
<Baz> Kept on screwing up this one race
<TrollightSparkle> But continue please Baz?
<DSNesmith> Clocks
<DecapKing> Most Wanted?
<DSNesmith> that's the name of it
<Baz> Got really pissed off
<DSNesmith> good song
<Baz> Threw my controller
<Baz> I hit the Gamecube and froze the game
<VioletVanilla> CLOCKS
<VioletVanilla> D:
<Baz> So I restarted it
<Baz> To find that I had 2 new cars
<DecapKing> probally Underground 2
<Baz> I have no idea what happened
<DSNesmith> only annoying thing about clocks is that practically everyone plays it
<TrollightSparkle> Lol
<DSNesmith> OMG
<DecapKing> i hated that game with a passion actually
<Dark_Heart> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK9DDL0hbDo&feature=feedlik
<DSNesmith> THAT LAST BIT
<Baz> I think it was just Underground
<Baz> But yeah
<DSNesmith> THAT'S WHERE THAT'S FROM
<DSNesmith> damn
<Baz> Just
<Nittany_Tiger> I actually uninstalled BC2 when I became severely frustrated after one death.
<DSNesmith> I'd wondered
<Baz> New cars
<VioletVanilla> NEED FOR SPEEEEEED
<DSNesmith> from Madeon
<Baz> All the sudden
<DSNesmith> play Pony Culture next, Sirsprinkles!
<DashiteAlt> SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!
<Nittany_Tiger> I loved NFS: Hot Pursuit.
<VioletVanilla> The new one?
<VioletVanilla> YOU PALY?
<VioletVanilla> PLAY*
<DecapKing> also BC2:Vietnam was awesome
<Nittany_Tiger> I always just played Hot Pursit.
<Nittany_Tiger> I actually liked Vietnam.
<Baz> I can't wait until the get Criterion working on a NFS game on the Frostbite 2 Engine
<TrollightSparkle> Two of my Gamecube controllers I bashed so many times on the ground, they shut my Gamecube off after about a minute XD
<VioletVanilla> IT'S IN THE WORKS BAZ
<DSNesmith> what is this D:
<Natleyn> Wait, what song is this
<DecapKing> thanks Sprinkles
<Baz> Uh
<DashiteAlt> Hot Pursuit was indeed awesome.
<VioletVanilla> NFS: The Run
<Baz> There's a NFS game on the Frotbite 2 engine
<Dark_Heart> :O
<Baz> But that's not being made by Criterion
<DashiteAlt> Yeah, new one is the Run.
<DashiteAlt> Made by Black Box
<TrollightSparkle> Who played Burnout as a kid?
<Baz> They made some really bad NFS games :V
<Nittany_Tiger> All the weapons were unlocked from the start. I wish more MP games didn't make you earn weapons.
<VioletVanilla> True. . .
<Nittany_Tiger> And perks.
<Baz> And they've fucked up The Run
<Baz> Did you see the E3 trailers?
<DecapKing> i played Paradise alot
<VioletVanilla> I. . .
<Baz> NFS: Quick Time Edition
<VioletVanilla> I played Paradise. . .
<VioletVanilla> ):
<TrollightSparkle> Aw...
<Nittany_Tiger> I played the original Burnout
<VioletVanilla> but that's part of the story Baz. . .
<Natleyn> What song? :<
<Nittany_Tiger> And Burnout 2.
<Baz> So yeah, The Run is gonna be shit
<TrollightSparkle> I remember playing Burnout 1 and Burnout 2 :)
<VioletVanilla> You're not nameless loser driver number 50293
<VioletVanilla> You're this dude
<DecapKing> Are You Dead Yet
<VioletVanilla> That needs to go steal a car
<Nittany_Tiger> And 3 or the one after that.
<Natleyn> ^Thanks :3
<VioletVanilla> in order to save yourself
<Nittany_Tiger> After EA got a hold of Criterion.
<TrollightSparkle> Quick question, what's the song name?
<Nittany_Tiger> Burnout was such a fun racing game.
<DecapKing> Are You Dead Yet
<VioletVanilla> ENOUGH
<Baz> But afterwards I'm sure they're gonna go back to Criterion and have them do another NFS game, on the Frostbite 2 engine
<VioletVanilla> My ship sails in the morning~
<Baz> Should be good
<Baz> Cause like
<VioletVanilla> I wonder what's for dinner~
<Baz> Hot Pursuit was good
<Baz> But it wasn't perfect
<TrollightSparkle> Thanks Decap
<Baz> Had a lot of issues
<Nittany_Tiger> I had one wreck where a car pushed me off of the track and into a valley.
<DecapKing> i suggested it
<DSNesmith> someone needs to do a PMV of Heeding the Call
<Baz> Ramming into other cars wasn't really...effective in Hot Pursuit as a Racer, and that was a bit of a letdown
<Nittany_Tiger> Anyone play BLACK?
<DecapKing> i did for a little bit
<TrollightSparkle> Black?
<Denied_Existence> Did at one point
<DSNesmith> isn't that the game that had a lot of guns
<VioletVanilla> Yeah, ramming as a Racer was pointless
<DecapKing> that game had amazing graphics for and xbox
<DSNesmith> as its main point
<DecapKing> *an
<Nittany_Tiger> It was a shooter by Criterion.
<DSNesmith> pony culture!
<TrollightSparkle> Hmm, never heard of it tbh
<DSNesmith> :/
<Baz> And from a Criterion game I was expecting that to be part of the gameplay
<Octavia> 14We didnt start the fire...
<Denied_Existence> DSNesmith and a really good Frostbite-esque engine
<Baz> I mean, it is, as a cop
<Denied_Existence> OH GOD THIS SONG <3
<DSNesmith> oh boy
<Baz> But
<DSNesmith> what version is this
<Baz> Yeah
<TrollightSparkle> Only shooters I remember playing back then were Wolf 3D, Halo, and Serious Sam.
<DSNesmith> the original?
<VioletVanilla> BILLY OJEL
<VioletVanilla> JOEL*

<Baz> Well
<DecapKing> its never too early for Molestia
<Baz> I haven't been a practicing Jew for a long time
<Skag> This song
<Skag> Is actually surprisingly good
<Baz> Though Judaism isn't just the religion, it's an ethnicity, so I can't really just "Stop being Jewish"
<PrincessMolestia> 13Wake up in da mornin feelin like da Fuhrer. Write Mein Kampf, tell Germany I'm gonna make race purer, before I leave, fuck my niece with Eva Braun too, cause when I leave for Mein Reich I'm gonna kill some Jews

<Shiggy> here comes another chinese product
<TrollightSparkle> Lawl
<Kencolt706> So... what's coming up, if anything?
<GGgala> here comes another My Little Funny toy
<Kencolt706> Eeeew.
<Skag> ..Is this sonic music?
<TrollightSparkle> Sounds like it.
<Kencolt706> I don't think so.
<Denied_Existence> Back again, was working on powerpoint
<Kencolt706> I may be wrong-- it does have that ring to it, but the lyrics don't quite match the usual Sonic theme...
<help76> Hi
<Skag> Maybe by the same band who does the sonic music\?
<Skag> DEfinitely has the same recurring themes
<help76> there is a place online that is using your chat service
<Kencolt706> Ah. So sim,ilar.
<Skag> musically, not so much lyrically
<help76> to operate an illegal prank call radio show and has called me over and over
<TrollightSparkle> Crush 40?
<help76> can you please help me I can provide their direct phone #
<Kencolt706> No credits, so...
<Natleyn> Well, there's the sonic
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Suinide and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<FormalHavvy> If you have their direct phone # and where they are at, have the police investigate.
<Kitsune> guess not
<Turtaguin> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Natleyn> Quiet chat is quiet
<Natleyn> Nevermind.
<Kencolt706> And who just sat on my pincushion?
<TrollightSparkle> Well sorta
<Natleyn> ohhaiskype
<Natleyn> Lol, Touhou.
<TrollightSparkle> This is a sonic theme
<Skag> Eeeeyup
<TrollightSparkle> Quite badass, might I say.
<Skag> Yeah, most of the ones from sonic adventure 2 battle were awesome
<Skag> IT all kinda went downhill from there, or so I hear
<Skag> I haven't played many of the newer sonic games
<TrollightSparkle> TBH I never played Sonic Adventure, any of them.
<Skag> You really should
<TrollightSparkle> I'll try
<Kencolt706> It might be tricky to find the consoles required.
<TrollightSparkle> Oh, there's emus for that :)
<Skag> Even if you wanted the console, theres versions for the gamecube anyway
<Kencolt706> I know one movie I should like to see here-- that would truly testthe will and fortitude of everypony here.
<TrollightSparkle> Hm?
<Kencolt706> Plan Nine from Outer Space.
<TrollightSparkle> I haven't heard of it.
<PrincessMolestia> 13I'm bi winning!
<Kencolt706> I watch it every Halloween religiously.
<Sumica> I like the dash version of this better.
<Kencolt706> You... you never heard of Plan Nine? You poor deprived pony...
<TrollightSparkle> Yeah, I am deprived.
<TrollightSparkle> And damn, not this song.
<Kencolt706> It's been called the Worst Film Ever Made. (It's not, there are worse-- but not by damn much.) It's certainly the quirkiest ever made. It's the quintessential Ed Wood Film.
<Kencolt706> It's simply but, a true masterpiece os Cinema Pathetique.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Inb4 damn Mr Rogers
<Skag> Oh man
<Skag> dis song
<Turtaguin> oh god,,,
<TrollightSparkle> I'll consider it
<Natleyn> inb4spikewins
<PrincessMolestia> 13I remember when this song first came out. Loooong time ago it seems now
<TrollightSparkle> Aw damn
<Skag> Indeed
<Kencolt706> It is literally-- if you have yet to see it-- unlike ANYTHING you ahve ever seen... because it's so magnificently inept it's hilarious.
<PrincessMolestia> 13I want to say 4chan made a version too...
<Natleyn> And it was terrible.
<Kencolt706> Won't you be my victim?
<Kencolt706> The most interestting-- run that. Got to see that.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Att Nat :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13*aww
<Synros> hey everyone
<TrollightSparkle> ?
<Synros> im back
<TrollightSparkle> Oh hai
<Kencolt706> Actually, more of an alfalfa type-- but Hay is okay.
<Synros> well then...we have a problem then...
<Synros> alfalfa everyone...just doesn't sound the same
<Kencolt706> Not at all. the more ponies that stick to hay, the more alfalfa for me!
<TrollightSparkle> Hm?
<Natleyn> Bawss.
<TrollightSparkle> I'm.. I'm confused now.
<Synros> eat hay like a boss!
<Turtaguin> Like a baws
<Kencolt706> But the CEO eats Alfalfa.
<Synros> hmm I could uses a bagel right now
<TrollightSparkle> I saw this coming.
<Kencolt706> Bagel cream cheese and alfalfa.
<Synros> ok then ken, I'll alfalfa
<Synros> right after I finish eating this buffelo
<Synros> hmm so tasty
<Synros> I guess its technically a cow, but still
<Synros> HAHA lolwut?!
<PrincessMolestia> 13>I like Big Flanks is bettar
<Kencolt706> This is wrong on so many levels. I suggest, about 20#% more levels than the usual wrongness.
*Turtaguin is playing Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3DS version Master Quest
<TrollightSparkle> Lawl
<Synros> i just...just don't know wat to think about this.
<Kencolt706> What cares me is someone out there thought that this... song... fir the visuals. And DID it.
<GGgala> Turtaguin: so many qualifiers, there
<Turtaguin> :D
<Synros> lol the end
<Kencolt706> OK, the last was just... wrong/
<GGgala> >the last was just perfect
<GGgala> ftfy
<Synros> wait, why do the poines in Equestria wear saddles when there are no humans?
<PrincessMolestia> 13DY-NO-MITE!
<Kencolt706> Apparently it's a faswhion statement.
<Synros> i mean I know Celestia killed off all the humans, but still
<Kencolt706> In fact, there are instances of saddles with short skirt-like trim.
*PrincessMolestia 13searches for that Twi pic that says since there are no humans saddles must be kinky...
<Synros> I guess its could be for Spike, so it doesn't look like hes doing anything like in Winter Wrap up
<Kencolt706> And Celestia didn't kill off the humans. They just left for some planet called Earth.
<Sumica> .....so wrong
<Synros> why you kill all the Humans Molestia
<PrincessMolestia> 13I didn't kill them, per-se. They died from exhaustion. <3
<Synros> ok Ken, do you believe everything your master says?
<TrollightSparkle> That would be Trollestia..
<Kencolt706> No-one knows why. Except for an old text that said, "Dammit, we're going somewhere where the colors are muted so we won't go blind."
<Sumica> they cant be for riding, they don't have pommels or what ever that horn thing at the front is.
<Kencolt706> I learned much from Sensei.
<Kencolt706> That is a pommel.
<Kencolt706> Although English style saddles don't have pommels...
<Synros> ah damn, I want to show you guys a picture I drew about the effects of Pinkie's parties on the Human body, but its quiet bloody
<Synros> and I don't wanna risk linking it in this chat
<Turtaguin> whats this song from?
<Natleyn> Princess and the Frog.
<TrollightSparkle> I gotta go guys, I'll see yall later today.
<TrollightSparkle> Good night.
<Natleyn> Night Trollight!

<Kencolt706> Sleep well.

<SirSprinkles> 6Great movie, actually.

<Synros> hes white and nerdy
<Kencolt706> Yes, he is.
<Denied_Existence> U mad bro?
<Synros> .....
<Kencolt706> He's white and nerdy in a brilliant, majestic, and phenomemal way.
<Synros> I know I like Werid Al
<Sumica> I seem to recall there being a pony version of hardware store too.
<Synros> the Preform this Way music video is blocked in Canada on youtube, it sucks

<Kencolt706> Oh, and I have this uncontrollable urge nto bite Trixie. Whe annoys me.
<Natleyn> Vegetarian isn't bad.
<PrincessMolestia> 13I dunno, you strike me as a furry Ken. Not that I'm against furries. lol
<Synros> don't forget your bi-day sacrifice to keep Celestia pleased
<Synros> I'm never going to look at the original version of these songs the same again
<PrincessMolestia> 13Indeed.
<Kencolt706> Look-- it's wierd enough I have a cutie mark in the first place. Apparently it's because I consider my adopted family my pack... and NOTHING MESSES WITH MY PACK. Even if tey are ponies.
<Synros> wait, ken is part wolf?
<PrincessMolestia> 13Something. lol
<Synros> oh ok,
<PrincessMolestia> 13Hes a wolf raised by ponies :P
<Natleyn> Yep
<Synros> i see
<Synros> I'm a demigod, so its all cool
<Kencolt706> I;m a wold that was raised by ponies, adopted by ponies, mostly--but entirely-- have a po0ny outlook.
<Natleyn> baffar.
<Synros> thats why I like this site, noone gives a fuck what you are
<Kencolt706> But sometimes, biting must be done-- my family is my pack, and they don't jave claws of fangs.
<idea> i would like to be a brony raised by ponies adopted by peaguses
<Synros> SOAD!!!!
<Turtguin> thatd be so cool
<sotha> I love this song.
<Synros> YOU WANTED TO!
<Synros> IN MY SELF RIGHTOUS SUICIDE!!!
<sotha> I CRY
<Synros> Im just waiting for Al to sing Down with the Sickness
<Synros> or an AFi song
<Kencolt706> I still wanr 10 Million Fluttershys.
<Kencolt706> I just love that one. Insanely. In totally unreasonable ways.
<Synros> ohhhhh
<Synros> nooo leave old the old poniues
<Kencolt706> AHHH! what was that?
<sotha> I don't care so much about being a pony, but I would like to live in their world.

<Synros> YAH!!! down with the sickness!!!
<Kencolt706> It... it was horribly mutated ponies? Please?
<Synros> yeah Sotha I can't see myself as a pony, but I could see me living in Equestria as a human
<Kencolt706> yeah. I bite her. She annoys Mom.
<Synros> the youth of the nation
<Synros> such a moving song
<Kencolt706> And I'll bite Gilda if I can ever catch her. Stupid wings.
*Synros agrees with Ken
<Synros> O-O
<Kencolt706> Applejack is made of Dark Matter.
<sotha> Synros: I'm kind of neutral on being a pony. I would want to be one though if I were to be in Equestria.
<Synros> Sotha, my personaly just doesn't fit being a pony.
<Synros> that or I'd just a bad guy in Equestira
<Kencolt706> I still want 10 Million Fluttershys.
<Synros> walking ion the sun
<sotha> You could hang with Discord, Synros. My personality is actually pretty befitting of ponyhood.
<Turtguin> I love Ocarina of time so much...
<Synros> lol I'd be the boss of Discord lol\
<Synros> Synros/ Deciet
<Synros> derp
<Kencolt706> I'd just bite him.
<Synros> lol
<Synros> is Discord a pony or other humaniod?
<Kencolt706> Ponies are humanoids?
<sotha> So far Kencolt706 is sounding more like a piranha than a wolf...
<sotha> (I'm joking by the way.)
<Synros> no that not wat I mean Ken
<Turtguin> Is there a place where I can find all of al's remizes/covers of songs like this?
<Synros> I mean is he going to be a pony, or a being that walks on 2 feet like the Diamond dogs?
<Kencolt706> Look, I don't get that many chances to bite anything other than an apple or the nocciasional mouse.
<Kencolt706> Oh, don't bring up THOSE scruffy sneaky insults to all caniines.
<Synros> Sirsprinkles still streaming?
<sotha> NO NOT WOODWING POLKA

<PrincessMolestia> 13lol Niko, cousin! Nice. :P
<Dj-p0n3> how do i deal with a ponyhater?
<PrincessMolestia> 13Smother time with love and kindness.
<RobotPinkie> Depends... either turn them into a brony, or ignore them, I'd say :P
<Dj-p0n3> wats that fluttershy ... kill them all?
<Dj-p0n3> ok
<Dj-p0n3> i will do as fluttershy says
*Dj-p0n3 killes the pony hatter with a axe
<RobotPinkie> No idea what Fluttershy says, but it sounds nice http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viTkj0eu-fk
*Dj-p0n3 just lost the game
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> fuck you
<Dj-p0n3> lol
<Dj-p0n3> troll face
<RobotPinkie> What a coincidence, I just won the game.
<Dj-p0n3> -_-
<Dj-p0n3> obviosly not
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> dude, i just won the game too!
<RobotPinkie> Cool! I hear the game has a pretty low completion rate.
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> same
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> i think theres only like 5 hundred who have actually fuly completed it
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> in world total
<Dj-p0n3> srry i just had to gry to myslef
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I mean I still haven't done all the side missions, but I finished the story and I'm pretty determined.
<Dj-p0n3> cry**
<Dj-p0n3> my little pon is the only thing keeping me alive
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> same, exceot I finished the first one, but I decided I would just go through adn then go back and complete those later
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, at least you can keep playing after the credits. Too many games just end like that.
<Dj-p0n3> http://bronies.memebase.com/
<Dj-p0n3> best place ever
<Dj-p0n3> next to equstria daily
<Dj-p0n3> ...
<RobotPinkie> Man, my cupcakes are much prettier :P
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> yeah, thats why I like pokemon, because theres usually some thing after it, like in black theres still 4 cities you havn't been able to visit yet until after the credits
<Dj-p0n3> the videos arnt coming balk
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> i love tht site :3
*Dj-p0n3 hugs everyone goodbye
<Dj-p0n3> see you all later
<Dj-p0n3> ima kill myself
<Dj-p0n3> bai
<RobotPinkie> That's not a good idea, Dj-p0n3
<Dj-p0n3> bye
<RobotPinkie> Might I suggest some ponies?
*Dj-p0n3 kills himself
<RobotPinkie> NNNOOOOOOO
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> hey dj, howd you kill yourself?
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> is it at least creative?
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> or did you jsut hang yourself the boring way?
<RobotPinkie> ...I think he left.
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> yeah, he did, but he didn't kill himself, he doesn't have the balls
<RobotPinkie> Probably just jonesin' for pony, I'd guess
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> hes one of those overdramatic preteens
<PrincessMolestia> 13^
<RobotPinkie> lol most likely
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> whi think they're depressed, but they're really just deprived of attention or the love of friends or something
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> so thats why he turned to ponies because they are flowing with love tolerance and friendship
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> sounds pretty accurate if you ask me
<RobotPinkie> Well, at least friendship... and magic
<PrincessIdentityTheftLawsuit> :D
<RobotPinkie> It's weird, the whole community aspect of ponies came after, for me.
<Turtaguin> Hey everypoy!what'd I miss did anypony kill anypony?
<RobotPinkie> Hey Turtaguin
<Turtaguin> if you havn't figured it out by now i was prinncess
<RobotPinkie> and I'm pretty sure everypony is still alive.
<Turtaguin> yay
<RobotPinkie> (I was PrinceRoman, btw... I just had to)
<PrincessMolestia> 13Was that you RobotPinkie? lol
<PrincessMolestia> 13I liked the Prince Roman one, clever :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13Made me lawl
<Turtaguin> I was Princess
<Turtaguin> Prnicess______
<RobotPinkie> Too much GTA4 for me!
<Turtaguin> love that game
<PrincessMolestia> 13Ahh, okay Turt. You were clever too. :P
<Turtaguin> they shuold make gtaPonies
<PrincessMolestia> 13But the Prince Roman in particular made me lol :P
<RobotPinkie> Open world pony game... *drools*
<AndySQdancer> I think I need to request a Password Reset for AndySQdancer and don't know how--password was changed when they hacked into the server and I never got it changed successfully.
<RobotPinkie> lol, though my joke was only funny within the context, really
<Turtaguin> hey, i just found $25 in my pocket, score!
<RobotPinkie> It was the perfect set up
<PrincessMolestia> 13GTA pony edition would be... interesting
<PrincessMolestia> 13Thats hawt Turt
<Turtaguin> and instead of blood cupcakes
<RobotPinkie> That's pretty cool, I just got $80 or so back on my taxes this month, so yay!
<Turtaguin> yay!
<RobotPinkie> Those $80 quickly turned into ponies, though...
<Turtaguin> weed delers, here I come!
<Turtaguin> lmao
<Turtaguin> weed ponies?
<AlfalfaMonster> 6Somepony said weed.
<RobotPinkie> lol not quite
<Turtaguin> aww
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol Turt XD
<RobotPinkie> Haha
<PrincessMolestia> 13Alfalfa :P
<Turtaguin> lmao
<RobotPinkie> Well, I guess you could call the brushable hair a sort of weed...
<Turtaguin> fucking roll that shit!
<PrincessMolestia> 13DOH HO HO
<AndySQdancer> I was using mIRC but my Trial Copy expired and I am back to now using mibbit chat for the DinoRPG game on the English Server.
<Turtaguin> i want pony weed
<AlfalfaMonster> 6I'm an... Alfalfa... monster. =D
<RobotPinkie> Nah, I've tried weed twice. Not for me.
<Turtaguin> duddenly, alfalfa
<Turtaguin> suddenly*
<Turtaguin> Im literally addicted to caffeiene
<RobotPinkie> What I really want is a pony Zelda clone...
<Turtaguin> YES YES YES YES
<RobotPinkie> With a Link pony who's a unicorn
<Turtaguin> SWEET!
<Turtaguin> and navi is a baby dragon
<Turtaguin> and zelda is celestia
<RobotPinkie> If no one makes it soon, I might get to work on it... dead serious.
<Turtaguin> link can be twi
<Turtaguin> awesome!
<RobotPinkie> I'm lazy and busy though, but eh...
<Turtaguin> kokiri can be earth ponies i guess
<Turtaguin> ganon is nightmare
<RobotPinkie> Easy to spot a non-kokiri, then
<Turtaguin> yeah
<Turtaguin> gerudo can be pegasi
<RobotPinkie> I guess Unicorns would be Hylians... that'd work
<Turtaguin> and hyrulians unicorns
<Turtaguin> hylians*
<Turtaguin> what are sheikah?
<Turtaguin> alicorns?
<RobotPinkie> The Zora are obviously sea ponies!
<Turtaguin> lmao
<Turtaguin> this sounds awesome
<Turtaguin> what about goron?
<RobotPinkie> Not sure about the sheikah, couldn't they just be earth ponies who have more desert-themed colors?
<Turtaguin> sure
<RobotPinkie> lol Gorons could be buffalo, perhaps
<Turtaguin> maye gorons could be male ponies?
<Turtaguin> buffalo
<Turtaguin> that works
<RobotPinkie> ohwait, the sheikah could be zebras, of course
<Turtaguin> yes!
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Turtaguin> better idea!
*RobotPinkie writes this down
<Turtaguin> navi is parasprite
<RobotPinkie> or maybe Hylians should be alicorns, so Linkpony can discover the ability of gliding on air or something...
<Turtaguin> maybe, then who are unicorns?
<RobotPinkie> ...not sure.
<Turtaguin> maybe zora?
<Turtaguin> instead of seaponies?
<RobotPinkie> Hmmm
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I think maybe Gerudo would be better as Zebras
<Turtaguin> maybe gerudo should be unicorns, zora seaponies and goron pegasi
<RobotPinkie> sheikas could be unicorns
<Turtaguin> nah, i like the idea of sheikah zebras
<Turtaguin> this could really work
<RobotPinkie> Would be a ton of work though...
<Turtaguin> definately, but if we sell it we would make sooo much money
<Turtaguin> bronies have become like a 10th of the population
<RobotPinkie> lol that might be getting a bit ahead of ourselves
<Turtaguin> also little girls too
<Havvy> Which nick?
<Turtaguin> brb, the chocolate milk, it calls me
<RobotPinkie> Pegasi would serve a pretty Rito-like role, really.
<FormalHavvy> AndySQdancer: ^^
<Turtaguin> yeah
<Turtaguin> six sages=six elements of harmony
<Turtaguin> yuo have to awake the mane six
<Turtaguin> what is triforce?
<RobotPinkie> Though Hasbro would sue very hard if it's too derivative.
<Turtaguin> yeah
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I might make some proof of concept thing either way, but I know people are already working on Zelda-like pony games
<AndySQdancer> I think I got it done for AndySQdancer. Thanks. Old Blog had better instructions than when I tried to do it before.
<Turtaguin> you know, if push comes to shove we could send them a usiness email requesting use of the characters in return for a small fraction of profit if we decide to sell this, is we dont sell it the we wont be making a profit and since its oc they cant tounch us
<Turtaguin> business*
<RobotPinkie> lol I don't think that would work
<Turtaguin> why not?
<RobotPinkie> First you have to pay for a license to do something with the property, then there would be something in the contract about how much of the profits go to Hasbro.
<RobotPinkie> No way a hobbyist could do that
<Turtaguin> then that would effect whether this becomes hobby or profit
<Turtaguin> if we sell it, then we will make money, hands down
<RobotPinkie> lol I don't think it could get that far, even :P
<Turtaguin> if we dont sell it, then we aren't profiting from it, and since we aen't broadcasting the show or anything, only they're names and maybe small references to the show and layout of character, hey cant touch us
<Turtaguin> its all whether your making profit off of it or not
<Turtaguin> this would be a lot of work whts adding a month to the years of work this would take to preocess the legal stuff and allow stpreds to stock up??
<Turtaguin> stores*
<RobotPinkie> Just making a proof of concept thing is a lot of work, but I need to do something like that for school fairly soon either way.
<Turtaguin> yeah
<RobotPinkie> I'm not really big on the idea of making it a huge project though and selling it. :P
<Turtaguin> if we decide to see this thing through we are making a huge commitment of free time
<Turtaguin> but we would bei=come brony legends
<RobotPinkie> Haha, like I said, I doubt that could happen
<Turtaguin> you never know, shoot for the stars
<Turtaguin> or the moon, in this case
<RobotPinkie> I'd need to have a lot of people smarter than me help me out
<Turtaguin> wait, i just thought of something
<Turtaguin> since its a cpoy of legend of zelda, we would also need intedo's permission...
<Turtaguin> they would request a hefty part of profit
<Turtaguin> or at least them being the size they are I would assume they would
<RobotPinkie> Not really, no...
<Turtaguin> because they think "we could make twice as much as them if we made that game
<RobotPinkie> There are plenty of action RPGs out there
<Turtaguin> yes but if we use the name link and zelda, we would most definate;y get sued
<RobotPinkie> I wouldn't use any names if I tried...
<Turtaguin> lol
<RobotPinkie> Any owned names, I mean.
<Turtaguin> yeah, ik
<RobotPinkie> I have worked on a 2D zelda clone before, didn't get all that far.
<RobotPinkie> Got the map code mostly done and very nice Zelda 1 like screen transitions
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Turtaguin> eight now we need to ultimately decide if we are giong to do it or not, and if we are going to make profit, if we dont, it will take a huge load off our back, and be a lot easier legally, however this is a large amount of ork so we might want to make something of our work
<Turtaguin> we can think on it, but we do need to decide
<Turtaguin> sweet
<RobotPinkie> lol right now I can't do anything, I work and study
<Turtaguin> yeh, it wouls have to be a summer or 2 long projecgt
<Turtaguin> anyways, Im going to call it a night
<Turtaguin> Id like to talk about this agin sometime
<RobotPinkie> alright, night Turtaguin

<AllisZero> Ah, yeah, that's one game I never got to play
<Pegacorn> lol
<Pegacorn> SOMEPONY HELP ME!I'M GETTING MURDERED BY FLUTTERSHY AND PINKAMENA IN A STEAM CHAT!
<GGgala> lolwut
<Pegacorn> GET IN THERE GGGALA
<Pegacorn> SAVE ME
<GGgala> WHERE
<Pegacorn> THE GROUP CHAT
<Pegacorn> THE GROUP CHAT I'M IN
<GGgala> THEN INVITE ME OR SOMETHING
<Pegacorn> YOUR PROFILE I NOT SET UP SO I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON YOUR PROFILE.
<Pegacorn> *IS
<GGgala> THERE'S AN 'INVITE TO CHAT' BUTTON IN THE UPPER RIGHT ISN'T THERE
<CallistoHH> How do I set a topic?
<Pegacorn> YES
<AllisZero> I'm glad we don't have to go through this in real-world emergencies
<GGgala> Then use it, Pegacorn! I don't have the energy to keep yelling!
<AllisZero> Can you imagine calling 911 and spending 15 minutes to explain to the officer what the hell you need them for?
<WhatPayne> What's going on?
<Corvus_Corax> type /topic texthere
<Wrek> 05dunno
<CallistoHH> tks
<GGgala> Pegacorn: click 'Invite to Chat' -> click my name -> ??? -> save your ass
<WhatPayne> I don't think I'd want to get involved...
<CallistoHH> How do I stay as owner/op even when I have to go off line?
<Pegacorn> I CLICKED IT GGGALA
<GGgala> BIZARRE. Try again?
<Pegacorn> NEED SOME HELP HERE!
<GGgala> welp, so the chat's private then?
<GGgala> how did you get invited in the first place?
<Pegacorn> No idea.
<GGgala> I thought any member could invite new chat-members in Steam. weird.
<Barry> Hi
<GGgala> hey
<Corvus_Corax> sorry got DCed, did you register the channel?
<Barry> How are you?
<GGgala> not bad you?
<Barry> I'm good
<CallistoHH> yes
<CallistoHH> channel is registered
<Pegacorn> Ohai Barry
<Corvus_Corax> then you should get owner every time you join and are logged in.
<Barry> Hi Pegacorn
*Pegacorn is all bloodied
<GGgala> Pinkamena and Fluttershy, huh?
<Pegacorn> Eeyup
<GGgala> how DID that happen anyway?
<Pegacorn> I car-jacked a cab to get back here.
<GGgala> of course. it all makes sense now.
<Pegacorn> But to tell you what happened,they cut my horn and wings off,stabed my eyes with my wings,drilled my horn,opened my torso up,ripped my ribs out and stabbed my heart with them and they cut my ears off.
<GGgala> and you survived.
<Pegacorn> Eeyup
<GGgala> being immortal.
<CallistoHH> yes
<CallistoHH> but i have gone to a channel frequently and someone is always logged in as owner/op but is not there
<Pegacorn> Eeyup
<GGgala> what /are/ Pinkamena's and Fluttershy's Steam handles, anyway?
<Pegacorn> I dont remember.
<Kitsune> that would be, impossible, without someone else setting them to op. having a registerd channel means, no one but you gets ops automatically
<Kitsune> your access lists are empty
<Pegacorn> Pinkamena is in my blocked users list.
<CallistoHH> what is an access list
<Kitsune> it allows you, the channel owner, to set others to be automatically voiced, halfop'd, or op'd
<Kitsune> http://wiki.mibbit.com/index.php/Xop
<CallistoHH> ok tks
<Kitsune> ^ to manage the acess list
<Pegacorn> So is Fluttershy.
<Dermathil> Oi!
<Pegacorn> Ohai Dermathil
<Pinkie_Pie> Hey guys..
*Dermathil continues to watch various Dr Who episodes
*Pegacorn is now completely regenerated
*Pegacorn decides to hide his scars by wearing Nick's clothes.
<Pegacorn> Dermathil,you're better off not knowing what happened to me a couple of minutes ago.
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sok8KPWmT84&feature=related
<Pinkie_Pie> Shitstorm detected
<Pegacorn> Thank you.
<Pinkie_Pie> The walls of the internet will be torn down
<Pegacorn> Nope
<Pinkie_Pie> You dont think the power of shipping could break the internet?
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<Pinkie_Pie> People might as well grab guns and shoot each other, as much as they fight over it
<Pegacorn> Shipping can indeed break the internet.
<Pegacorn> But RD IS NOT A LESBIAN FOR GOD'S SAKE
<Pinkie_Pie> Lauren Faust said it hasnt been implied
<AllisZero> Well, see...
<AllisZero> She's a tomboy with rainbow-colored hair, and we all know what the rainbow stands for nowadays
<AllisZero> I personally don't think Dash is lesbian, but I see why people make that argument
<Pinkie_Pie> Lauren Faust said it was extremely unfair to both straight and lesbian tomboys to assume that.
<Pegacorn> TRUE DAT PINKIE
<Pinkie_Pie> I pretty much like all pairings, whether its straight or lesbian.
<Anonymous> :|
<Pinkie_Pie> So im neutral on all of it
<uhuhuh> hey all
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi

<AllisZero> Yep
<Dermathil> Aah, so Pegacorn decided to use his imagination by thinking of the Naruto...
<herospirit> Bluh Bluh I am here
*Pegacorn is still limping from earlier
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi Herospirit
<Pegacorn> I need some help!
<Pinkie_Pie> What?
*Pegacorn hears Usher's voice echoing in his head saying "Take your revenge!" and decides to do just that.Take his revenge on Pinkamena and Fluttershy for what they did to him earlier.
<Pinkie_Pie> What the heck are you talking about >.>
<herospirit> Oh gog Pegacorn what did Pinkie do
<herospirit> PINKIE WHAT DID YOU DO
<Pinkie_Pie> Nothing.. -.-
<Pegacorn> Pinkamena and Fluttershy cut my horn and wings off,stabed my eyes with my wings,drilled my horn,opened my torso up,ripped my ribs out and stabbed my heart with them and they cut my ears off.
<herospirit> :0
<herospirit> I think you'd be pretty much dead :0
<Pegacorn> I survived and car-jacked a cab to get back here.
<herospirit> Alicorns don't need their ribs or hearts? :0
<Pegacorn> I regenerated myself.
<herospirit> Are you like zombies? Do you have to cut your head off?
<Pegacorn> Nope
*Pegacorn runs off with a diamond sword and takes his revenge
<herospirit> As a total Brony and a Homestuck fan, I think I found one of my new favorite things ever http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItN-__ISh58&feature=player_embedded#!

<herospirit> Blarglarg Why is Big Mac so hard to sprite
<Pegacorn> I'm back
<herospirit> I might actually be better off doing BM from scratch instead of using the template
<herospirit> At least his non conformist head shape
<herospirit> Darn him and not being shaped like all the other Ponies
<Struscle> Hello.

<Pinkie_Pie> Herospirit, do you have terraria?
<Pegacorn> How's it going DecapKing?
<herospirit> Nein
<Pinkie_Pie> Aw
<Pinkie_Pie> Oops
<Pinkie_Pie> I tried to close steam and I hit firefox instead
<Pinkie_Pie> >.<
<Skak> hey. er ny her . nogen der kan hjælpe med nxtgn?
<Bot> this is the support channel for the *Mibbit* client or the *Mibbit* IRC network
<Bot> desvaerre ;)
<herospirit> I now have three reference pictures for Big Mac open. Maybe that'll help with the spriting.
<herospirit> Possibly.
<herospirit> Probably not.
<Pinkie_Pie> Your working on your RPG?
<Skak> på deres side står der man skal skrive herinde. er det forkert?
<Pinkie_Pie> I could make a MLP rpg with RPG Maker XP, but the problem is the lack of pony sprites
<Bot> det er forkert
*Pegacorn punches DecapKing
<herospirit> Naw, someone is making a Pony Fire Emblem
<Pinkie_Pie> I would have to use humanized ponies or something.
<herospirit> and they need Sprites
<FreezeFrame> The sprites will come
<Pinkie_Pie> I hope so
<herospirit> Pinkie Pie, what about the MLP Online sprites?
<Pinkie_Pie> Probably to small
<Hercule> re-read their page
<herospirit> Actually, I guess those would be a bit too large.
<Pinkie_Pie> Plus they have protection them
<Pinkie_Pie> To large?
<Pinkie_Pie> ...
<Pinkie_Pie> Link?
<herospirit> You can zoom in on them twice
<FreezeFrame> You could make 'em your own.
<Pinkie_Pie> They have anti theft protection on them FreezeFrame
<Pinkie_Pie> I have no idea how to take that off, and im not stealing them anyway
<Pinkie_Pie> Besides, they said they would release them later
<Pinkie_Pie> Besides
<herospirit> I think FreezeFrame means make your own
<Pinkie_Pie> I would need portrait sprites, fighting sprites.. ect
<Pinkie_Pie> SO
<Pinkie_Pie> MANY
<Pinkie_Pie> SPRITES
<herospirit> I know how that goes. I'm making all my own sprites for my RPG.
<herospirit> IT TAKES FORFUCKING EVER
<Pinkie_Pie> Holy shit
<Pinkie_Pie> I typed "Portrait sprites" into google images
<Pinkie_Pie> http://img.ponibooru.org/images/6b/6b727fe2f094c79a28e886361b9c737c
<Pinkie_Pie> Was one of the first results
<Pinkie_Pie> ITS A SIGN
<Pinkie_Pie> I MUST MAKE RPGS
<herospirit> lol
<DecapKing> try making a 3D model by usiing a 2D charecter as a model
<Pinkie_Pie> Decap
<Pinkie_Pie> I am talking about using this
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/product/rpg-maker-xp
<Pinkie_Pie> Not a 3D game maker
<FreezeFrame> No, I meant make your own, yes.
<Silverscreen> Allo.
<DecapKing> well im talking about 3Ds Max, Maya, and Mudbox
<Pinkie_Pie> I dont know how to make 3D models
<Pinkie_Pie> You try doing it, its not easy..
<Silverscreen> 11Depends on what you're trying to make a 3D model of.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm currently taking 3D classes with 3Ds Max as the program.
<Pinkie_Pie> Oh Gawd Herospirit
<herospirit> Well, my Big Mac isn't going nearly as poorly this morning as it was last night
<herospirit> Wat
<Pinkie_Pie> You got me into a RPG making mood
<herospirit> What did I do
<herospirit> Oops
<Pinkie_Pie> Im gonna download RPG maker XP again..
<herospirit> :p
<Pinkie_Pie> Yeah.. Oops >.>
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<DecapKing> i already took like 5 classes that used 3Ds Max
<Pinkie_Pie> I got 3Ds max for free
<herospirit> By the way, don't get too excited about my Rpg, because
<herospirit> 1. I pretty much suck at everything
<herospirit> 2. I've only followed through with about 1% of the things I've started through my life
<herospirit> : /
<Pinkie_Pie> Gotta start somewhere
<DecapKing> i feel like i suck at everything
<herospirit> I guess I don't suck at everything. I'm just mediocre at everything.
<herospirit> Terribly, boringly mediocre
<DecapKing> but according to other people im pretty good at stuff
<herospirit> You most likely are :0
<FreezeFrame> My Little Alicorn is quite amusing
<FreezeFrame> Prankluna vs. Pranklestia :D
<DecapKing> like for a class i had to make a map in UDK and had an hour to make it, so when i turned in mine in that was fully scripted, which wasnt even needed, i felt it was only worth around a D+ when the teacher gave me an A+
<herospirit> Having that kind of underconfidence in your own work says something good about your personality.
<herospirit> You hold yourself to a higher standard than others. :0
<DecapKing> most psychologist say that i just have low self esteem which is bullshit
<DecapKing> as i dont believe in self esteem
<VioletVanilla> X3
<VioletVanilla> Oh Decap, yu so funny~
<Pegacorn> I'm back
<VioletVanilla> PEGACRON!

<Pegacorn> You seem happy Violet.

<DecapKing> we should mourn out births as we would only end up dieing
<Wrek> 05kinky
<VioletVanilla> 6Clever disguise~
