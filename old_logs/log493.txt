<Ghosties> 04Eh, it just takes me out of the moment I suppose
<Barbetos> Aw I forgot about movie night =((
<Reikim> And then nothing sexual happened. The end.
<Silverscreen> 1,11The references are rather clever and fit into the movie, not just randomly shoe-horned in like most comedies do.
<maidtipsylicious> oprah is the only black chick
<sagas> Ryunosuke: Holy shit! Thats what he sounds like?
<Meanwhile> I so love Rowan Atkinson.
<fluttercry> 05,15This is the kind of movie Epic Movie tried to be

<Dark92Enigma> Kiss me, again
<RyunosukeKnT> that camera
<Meanwhile> It's not the way you lead me by the hand into the bedroom~
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The references also are not nearly as dated as Epic Movie's, which is pretty bad when Epic Movie came out only a few years ago.
<Silverscreen> 1,11This suddenly turned into Casablanca.
<Everlasting_Joy> Ghosties: Then the question is, what the hay happened to sink so low in the 2000's?
<Distortion> Well um what did I want todo again?:D
<sagas> backs off cliff
<SirGanjalf> inb4 ded
<Dark92Enigma> dat camera shot
<K_A> Ghosties: Epic Movie tried to be this genre of film, and it failed because the 2000s generally sucked.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Epic Movie failed because it dragged every joke out.
<Meanwhile> It's not the way you throw your clothes upon the bathroom floor~

<Darf14> Dexter died..... so Fission Mailed
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Dexter Heyman (Rowan Atkinson)'s final scene is a reference to many Warner Bros. "Coyote & Road Runner" cartoons, where the Coyote would always end up falling into an abyss and leaving a dust cloud upon impacting on the ground. This and many other references are made throughout the movie.
<otakon> indeed Mr. President is FRIGGIN UNFLAPPABLE

<Meanwhile> Emphasise may
<Midnight_Tempest> this movie was intelligently written for a comedy movie... this is why i miss 80's and early 90's comedies

<StinkomanFan> IT'S JULY FORTH
<sagas> SCHEDUALCEPTION
<DocSane> Why is she meeting with the hay board?
<Calcos323> Sumica, during the scene where Twilight infiltrates the library, can you play something from the MGS soundtrack?
<Reikim> StinkomanFan: Now I'm thinking about how that dream would have continued and gah
<Randomiser> I hate waking up from nice cream dreams.
<Dark92Enigma> owlicous IN SOVIET RUSSIA, THE MOVIE CHOOSES YOU!
<Dances_With_Discord> What a crisis
<Gunthler> 1,5
<Alister> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Wakking up in the night hearing your sister/friend clopping . poor spike
<Mozdoc> Only Twilight would worry about this. Not able to schedule another schedule in this months schedule.

<AJ> o god why?
<Biglaw> Night RanYakumo!
<Dark92Enigma> Dat's a Creamy Dream
<Everlasting_Joy> Night night RanYakumo.
<StinkomanFan> A nice cream dream :p
<Barbetos> Cream dream... is that supposed to imply a wet dream?
<DocSane> Her problem is she assumes too much responsibility
<Rodman> Stupid sexy cream dream
<Firaga> Cream dreams, if you know what i mean
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> 'Ice cream dream' = wet dream?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did Sumica silence his pings?
<AJ> StinkomanFan: /)
<owlicious> I'd give rarity ice cream... if she didn't mind, that is
*Reikim headdesks
<The_Si> And ice cream makes it all complete
*ponibas hits Ponies47 with a newspaper
<Mozdoc> Twilight is the cause of her own problems. That's all there is too it.
<StinkomanFan> (\ AJ
<owlicious> Sumica did. That is sad

<Dark92Enigma> FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCE!!!!!!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Scootaloooo
<Reikim> That...just happened.
<Biglaw> Fraaaaannnnccceee
<Silverscreen> 1,11Many jokes were original, and while the references aren't, the jokes made with those references ARE original and, to give my honest opinion, more entertaining as a whole than what Evil Dead 2 was.
<DocSane> She's not an elected official or a business leader.
<Spectrum_Rush|WON> Nittany_Discord: yus
<RX-78-SweetieBot> And then everypony had sex
<sagas> gotta schedual time to schedual the making of scheduals so you can follow your schedual
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Can't say I caught that the first time around.
<Darf14> Scootaloo has a good crowing voice
<StinkomanFan> Now, as I was saying
<Dark92Enigma> Hai ponibas

<Biglaw> Yo dawg I head you like reading...
<SirGanjalf> I said hey!

<StinkomanFan> Otakon would die at the hand of his own anger
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :3
<Dark92Enigma> ponibas how you're doing?
<Midnight_Fyre> Whaaa? underlining? but how?
<Pale_Horse> If Rarity ate marshmallows, would that count as cannibalism?

<Ponies47> ponibas: I CAN SEE YOUR TROLLING BULL(SQUEE) :[

<Reikim> fluttercry: it hurts my eyes.
<Biglaw> Dun dun duuuunnn
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm actually looking for a new combo. red and grey is boring
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Looks nice on my client.
<StinkomanFan> The two would end up fighting into the mod's room
<[B]JRP2234> Ghosties: did i miss the lottery
<Firaga> Whatever you do dont drop the soap
<Ponies47> ponibas: :|
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FUUUUUUUTURRRRE.
<AJ> omg
<DocSane> Tuesday is an inherently funny day.
*Gunthler 1,5nom
<Alister> Reikim: tell me , would you happen to have expereince with girls ?
<Ghosties> 04Yes, JRP
<Aeina> TS needs to catch up on her common time travel plots >_>

<Pale_Horse> See you next Tuesday...
<Randomiser> The party don't start till I walk in
<sagas> I dont want you to worry about the future, so i go back in time to worry you
<Darf14> Poor Doormat

<Gunthler> It seems like cats :3
<valoreins> dat doormat
<The_Si> WE CAN SEE THE FUTURE
<Darf14> lol
<owlicious> but the baloons have a lot of drag!
<DocSane> Doctor Whooves laughs at your temporal paradox.
*Meanwhile 12,4 what?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Even the doctor laughs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Berry Punch tastes awesome.
<Reikim> Alister: Yes, although the sum total of that experience is debatable depending on who you're asking.
<Meanwhile> Holy crap that actually works.
<K_A> Oh there were still plenty of original and good jokes, though.
<fluttercry> 05,15Stop with the colors!
<StinkomanFan> Once otakon and Meanwhile fall into the room where only Mods may live
<sagas> Doctor whooves keeps a straight face
<Meanwhile> You should sort that out.
<Biglaw> Doctor Hooves, why you laugh?
<Crippler> haw haw
<Alister> Reikim: I don't get it
<dshannon> and this is why no one believes her in the wedding episodes
<otakon> huh?
<Reikim> fluttercry: Try pink and yellow.
<Meanwhile> Eh?
<StinkomanFan> They would instantly turn to dust
<Darf14> lol
<Everlasting_Joy> Dr. Whooves laughs because he knows you can't cross your own time stream.
<otakon> NO MORE COLORS!
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Dark92Enigma> Pinkie Pie just made a METALLICA reference! <--------
<Crippler> Berry Punch laughs in the face of death
<SteveCharb> Twilight's urgent message: I shot an elephant in my pajamas! How he got in my pajamas, I have no idea!
<SunderlandPony89> ALL the colors!
<diddutz> DocSane: timey wimey 6_9
<Firaga> dshannon: that makes so much freaking sense
<[B]JRP2234> Ghosties: can i have the winners
<Crippler> cuz she's wasted
<sagas> Everlasting_Joy: Yes you can
*Meanwhile 12,4 a few more colours.
<Ponies47> *RUNS FOR LIFE*
<Meanwhile> Sorry.
<Gunthler> lol
<DocSane> And don't inform the princess or anything.
<Gunthler> lol
<fluttercry> 05,15No more colors...srs
<K_A> And I remember how everypony insisted Future!Twilight would be an alicorn goddess or a post-apocalypse personality.
<Everlasting_Joy> sagas: I know, I'm just having some Dr. Who fun.
<SirGanjalf> Ruuun to the hiiiiiiiiiils!
<owlicious> no, crossing time streams leads to disaster
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ow
<Meanwhile> Srs face. :I
<StinkomanFan> I was writing your creative death otakon
<desertman2> Sometimes you can, sometimes you can't
<Reikim> Alister: It means that exactly how much experience I have depends on which of my friends you ask, and what topic. Shoot your questions anyway, if I screw up then the rest of manechat will help.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> join in the panic
<Silverscreen> 1,11AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
<DashWithRainbows> fluttercry is srs, post Fluttershy
*Dark92Enigma runs away too
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> DINKY

<fluttercry> 05,15Yes, post fluttershy
<Dances_With_Discord> *Joins Pinkie in Panic*
<sagas> Everlasting_Joy: But that was never said in Doctor Who...
<Reikim> :(
<Pale_Horse> Applejack is best Mason.
<StinkomanFan> :(
<Silverscreen> 1,11in the long run, this is probably a very, very good thing.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> eeyup
<XAX> how does one simply wipe concrete out of their mane?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hooray for clean energy.
<Kandarihu> And no pony had to build faraday cages because they don't have any electronics.
<Everlasting_Joy> sagas, yes it has been.
<SunderlandPony89> StinkomanFan: Make sure otakon is dressed as a French knight
<DashWithRainbows> Or draw fluttershy <_< >_>
<Ponies47> eeyup
<Firaga> So if she can teleport any time,why didnt she teloported into the future?
<Alister> Reikim: ok Bronysith already convinced me to confess , but the problem is that I think my best friend loves the same girl as me
<DocSane> And all of Ponyville's infrastructure was fixed, so the effort wasn't wasted at all.
<StinkomanFan> But it was a draw
<hen3ry> bad mane day, averted
<StinkomanFan> both of them died
<otakon> a french knight?
<StinkomanFan> :p
<sagas> Everlasting_Joy: But they do cross their time streams. I remember it happening
*Spectrum_Rush|WON now let me ask the chat did anypony expect something like a cerberus and tarterus referance ?
<Tassadork> what disaster was that I wonder...
*Midnight_Fyre suddenly getting really tired
<owlicious> Kandarihu: you could probably make a faraday cage out of scootaloo wire
<Darf14> Hello Philidelphia :)
<Meanwhile> SunderlandPony89: make sure he's white as snow.
<HoboAddiction> Las Pegasus... really? xD
<Mozdoc> Los Pegasus.
<Everlasting_Joy> sagas: Yes, they do it, but they try to avoid it because of a paradox.
<Aeina> Fillydelphia!
<Dark92Enigma> Pinkie Pie said ''RUN FOR YOUR LIVES'' Opening for RUN TO THE HILLS
<Cedridor> Found it!
<Ponies47> Las Pegasus :D
<Mozdoc> Yep, the west coast now gets a pony city.
<sub06905> Las Pegasus
<RyunosukeKnT> ZUUL MUTHERFUCKER!
<Reikim> Alister: Oh man this is going to be awkward. I mean, stereotypical sitcom drama and all, but there are some things that TV doesn't lie (too much) about.
<StinkomanFan> Alright, next request!
<XAX> where did scroll go D:
<FaithHeart> Hollar at Fillydelphia (my hometown)
<SunderlandPony89> Meanwhile: Good to know someone's getting it :P

<Silverscreen> 1,11That mispronounciation.

<sub06905> Las Pegasus = Pony Hangover movie
<DocSane> Which means the gates of hell aren't far from Ponyville.
<DeathStar> oh pinkie

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> DAMNIT
<SunderlandPony89> Aww
<Aeina> I like how Celestia's response to cerberus going loose is to send out a "lost dog" flyer
<Alister> Reikim: what do you mean by like a sitcom ?
<Firaga> inb4 kratos is now pony canon
<dshannon> 0.0
<Reikim> Alister: Although it could probably be solved cleanly if you're lucky and smart.
<desertman2> She thinks it's great that Ponyville will be destroyed
<dshannon> the tail
<sagas> Everlasting_Joy: I know, but I remember them doing it when Amy got caught in the alternate time stream and she met herself 40 years later
<K_A> Fluttershy was overpowered this season. Did she get an accessory to speed up her experience gain or something?

<SteveCharb> GO BACK TO THE HELL FROM WHENCE YOU CAME!
<Calcos323> K_A: No, Capcom made a patch
<DocSane> Scuse me while I run to hell and back.
<Crippler> in case of ball-related problems
<HoboAddiction> ball emergencies are serious business

<SirGanjalf> Twilight is Scarface
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Like a melon in a mud puddle.
<Shamroc> fairly hard to see
<Spectrum_Rush|WON> according to her reflection her cut changes sides
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> you cannot change the future, you can only alter the course of events leading up to the future
<Everlasting_Joy> sagas, like I said, they try to avoid it, but in that case, present Amy was unconsious, so she couldn't do a thing to future Amy, and they wanted to save present Amy to annihilate future Amy.
<DocSane> Twilight needs to be sedated.
<owlicious> No, they're above the gates of "Hel" (proper spelling
<Ponies47> DANG SCAR YOU SCARY! :o

<Crippler> twilight foolishly ignored the cut and later died of gangrene.

<fluttercry> 05,15So, keep the one I have now then?
<sub06905> what trolls
<Alister> Reikim: Well , I pretty much only see him in high school since we live in different towns. In school there's this really annoying douche who finds funny to spred my secrets around
<Dark92Enigma> MOUSES? I HATE MOUSES!!!!!!

<Reikim> Alister: Ouch on that first bet, yes on the second. It's a rough sketch I threw together for a friend the other day. Should probably ink in the outline, but I feel lazy.
<owlicious> Twilight: you don't have the power to change the future
<StinkomanFan> You will never be that cool
<Dark92Enigma> Pale_Horse TIME TRAVEL FTW
<K_A> I recommend Adblock Plus. It's out for Firefox and Chrome!

<sub06905> madam pinkie
<SunderlandPony89> Should of been Whooves
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> FlareChaser|Diablo3 what ?
<Kandarihu> You do realize that Pinkie Pie's item placements totally break the aesop of this episode. Because she was prepared for emergencies that even WITH her Pinkie Sense, she couldn't have possibly predicted.
<DocSane> Gypsy magic is canon
<Meanwhile> I was going for white text on blue background.
<SteveCharb> I'll cook up a solution with the knowledge I've accrued
<Firaga> and then she became snake plinket
<hen3ry> ah. Yes, Gypsy magic.
<Meanwhile> Idk where that red came from.
<Dark92Enigma> PINKIE PIE SENSE
<Ponies47> ponibas: My computer sucks so hard it won't download it ;(
<Darf14> I trust Pinkie Pies fortune telling
<sagas> Everlasting_Joy: So future Amy affected past Amy. Altering her own timeline when she chose to save her past self. Eventhough doing so annihalates future Amy, she still affected her own timeline.
<Ponies47> :(
<SteveCharb> they say a kitchen time saves nine, but I'm just saving two
<K_A> Also, that Firefox pony you guys kept posting. It wasn't until the next day I realized where it came from, derp.
<kidzrul434> what are the results of the lottery?
<ponibas> .. wow
<AJ> wait
<Dark92Enigma> CHIMYCHERRYCHANGA

<Acheron187> Silverscreen: Cheerilee does the 80s look so much better
<XAX> pinkie's voice. aawwww :3
<AJ> you can only see 3 walls in life
<StinkomanFan> You're hardly "Homer Simpson" level of cool at the moment Meanwhile
<Alister> Reikim: Awesome , you'd get really good if you detailed it more
<DocSane> Pinkie costumes are the best costumes.
<Biglaw> Bad Orb! Orb is bad in amnesia!
<SirGanjalf> THE FUTURE
<Dark92Enigma> DO THE WALK DO THE TALK
<AJ> so are we all 4th wall breakers?
<Biglaw> Orb is evil!!!
<FlareChaser|Diablo3> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Diablo 3, me, Bronysithm and you were gonna play :|
<Pale_Horse> Fun Fact: I myself am a time traveller... I travel into the future at a speed of 1 second per second. :D
<SteveCharb> I've gathered the ingredients to make some time sorbet
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: I don't even know what that means.
<Om> That is going to a ep in season 3
<Reikim> Alister: Again, laziness :P would probably help if I also had a tablet.
<Dark92Enigma> THE ORB OF CONFUSION
<Biglaw> XD
<sagas> Orb is SATANIC WITCHCRAFT!
<SteveCharb> there's hardly room for seconds when the seconds melt away

<Silverscreen> 1,11Dat genre savvy
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: that's not bad.
<Dark92Enigma> PINKIE, YOU SO RANDOM
<SteveCharb> SunderlandPony89: why?
<Everlasting_Joy> sagas: It was Rory who saved present Amy, but Future Amy wasn't annihilated per se, it was the current version was altered to another version because of present Amy being rescued.
<SunderlandPony89> SteveCharb: I lol'd. Hard.
<Reikim> SunderlandPony89: Don Quixote and the War of The Worlds?
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: Oh ok then.

<xXxSc0oT4Lo0xXx> 00,03That suit must be tight as hell to cover Pinkie's mane..
<Reikim> Should probably do the inking on that drawing I sent to Alister.
<desertman2> Can't she teleport in?
<StinkomanFan> Also, Pinkie Pie wears rubber suits for fun
<DeathStar> oh pinkie ^-^
<DocSane> And being Celestia's protoge, I totally have access to the archives, but I forgot about that
<Barbetos> I have to admit, that pinkie is pretty cute.
<StinkomanFan> Kinky
<Dark92Enigma> IT SOUNDS FUN TO ME
<Everlasting_Joy> I love it how Pinkie thinks Twi is wanting to find out about her birthday present.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Kinky Pie
<sub06905> close enough
<DocSane> Barbetos: Pinkie is very, very cute.
<valoreins> i want to see princess Luna with spandex...
<hen3ry> rationally analyzing Twi at this point is pointless, she's totally lost it
<Reikim> No.

<Reikim> Ignore
<sagas> Everlasting_Joy: I recall future Amy rescuing past Amy, resulting in future Amy not getting to the TARDIS on time before The Doctor locked it. Resulting in future Amy being the reason that present Amy made it on time. I dont know though. That episode was all sorts of timeline paradox mind fucks.
<CupcakeWarrior> AJ (\

<PartyCannon> dat double lesson
<Airpuff> Om: i guess >.>
<StinkomanFan> WIBBLY WOBBLY
<Spectrum_Rush|WON> DeathStar: something about luna lovegood
<Dark92Enigma> THE TIME LOOP WILL GO ON FOOOORRRRRRREVEEEEEEEERRR
<Dark92Enigma> BUT OK
<StinkomanFan> stuff...
<OctoReikim> If only
<Silverscreen> 1,11To EVVVERRRYONE trying to figure out the "beginning" of this time loop, I have a nice quote from Harry Potter's own Luna Lovegood: "A circle has no beginning."
<Meanwhile> Take the Janeway approach to temporal paradoxes. Ignore them.
<SteveCharb> did spike died?
<sagas> Everlasting_Joy: Its only a pain when thinking about paradoxs. Otherwise its awesome! If only we knew what would happen if you committed a paradox
<twilight_sprinkle> DeathStar: yeah it was on tv. but i was watching hot shots 2 and harry potter at the same time, i missed half of each, and it was my first time seeing hp dh2...
<DeathStar> Spectrum_Rush|WON: nope
<desertman2> So the lesson is "Don't eat so much ice cream"?
<Darf14> Poor Future spike
<Biglaw> Lesson, don't eat ice cream for 24 hours straight
<Pale_Horse> If I ever travel back in time, I'm gonna paradox just to see what the hell happens.
<Firaga> dear princess celestia, today i fucked the space time continium
<OctoReikim> If I had eight arms, I could manipulate 4 keyboards.
<DocSane> You notice how the 6 break off into pairs for certain episodes. As in they're best freiends within the group?
<Dark92Enigma> HA, Serves you right Spike!
<Acheron187> the future is not yet set.....
<StinkomanFan> and then Spike died of a burst appendix
<xXxSc0oT4Lo0xXx> 00,03Spike's logic is flawed...
<Om> Airpuff: Don't look at me. Its the law.
<Kandarihu> Sumica: mind doing the two hour loop version for Euro Movie Night?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> he ded
<PartyCannon> It begins at its tangent
<hen3ry> future spike is worst spike
<K_A> Next season prediction: They are visited by Starswirl regarding something that is unleashed when the hourglass runs out.
<AJ> StinkomanFan: nooo
<Darf14> aww its over :(
<OctoReikim> Then I could have four sock puppets with which to troll.
<twilight_sprinkle> you can just say that during the big bang the circle was created
<DocSane> Pinkie is clearly Twilight's very best friend of all.
<CupcakeWarrior> Well who cares about Spike anyway?
<Spectrum_Rush|WON> DeathStar: something about helga hufflepuff/
<AJ> StinkomanFan: from icecream headache
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Circular time paradoxes do have beginnings.
<Airpuff> Om: .. :| The law?
<Biglaw> hopefully Limbo shall work on my other computer...
<Midnight_Fyre> g'night. I'm off to bed
<Meanwhile> Well, that was fun. But it's almost 5 in the morning.

<Blaze_Anderson> ok, i have one question, what happened to spyro and cynder after spyro saved the earth in dawn of the dragon?
<ponibas> and FYI, sumica isn't answering my texts.. so he might have FDOK'd
<Reikim> StinkomanFan: Silly brony. He's not interested in some plushie! He's only interested in her jewels.
<Om> Ponies47: Now keep trying until you have drawn 1000 drawings.
<Woodenshy|WINNING> cachi01: DO NOT MENTION THAT SONG AROUND ME AGAIN. I just really don't like So Many Wonders. :(

<Kencolt> Actually, G3 wasn't good, but it wasn't a source of all pain. G 3.5 on the other hoof, was the product of time-traveling Anti-Brony extremists, in an attempt to kill the franchise once and for all, thus causing our community to never exist. Luckily, that guy with the blue box corrected things just enough for Hasbro to pick Lauren Faust instead of Micheal Bay.
<Reikim> You're done. Stop trying.

<Iron_Edge> Mish: ah.
<otakon> Ponies47: you could have at least gotten a decent PC for that much or at least a servicable one. But don't EVER trust E-machines they suck ass

<ponibas> Ponies47: Patience my young grasshopper
<cachi01> erectin a pootis
<Reikim> To be honest, I don't really keep track of what mods stream...I just know that Val trolls with G3 and rocks with Metalocalypse, Wrek draws saucy ponies, and others kind of just do their thing.
<CupcakeWarrior> dat winrar
<Mish> Wrek is an amazing artist :O
<Ponies47> otakon: I'm just pissed off at myself for being such an idiot my dad for talking me into it and my computer for you know what :
<Blaze_Anderson> yea, so how do you feel about the movie's cancelation
<Ponies47> :|
<richfiles> I just want to see Escape from Midnight castle played here once
<Ponies47> ponibas: For what?
<CupcakeWarrior> Mish: Have you seen his new AJ drawing?
<Reikim> So this looks fun.
<Mish> lets play the guess the name game!
<flutter_spin> Don't care for Val streams. Wrek has interesting tastes in music, but I lack attention to drawing for hours. Sumica streams awesome shows.
<otakon> Well, this looks interesting
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wat?
<Pony_9001> lolwtf
<otakon> The hell?
<ponibas> for selling the books
<Stallion_of_War> Mish: Wrek is best artist

<CupcakeWarrior> What game is this?
<Bluestrom_S> yay kerbal space program!!!
<StinkomanFan> Om your worst fears
<otakon> flutter_shy: Luna had the nostalgia down, but she hasn't streamed in awhile.
<Bluestrom_S> I love this game
<CupcakeWarrior> Ive never heard of this game, what is it?
<flutter_spin> Games is a good spin on things, but my preference is to writing when it comes to more than 20min of game time
<Om> StinkomanFan: Not even close.
<Reikim> I know people will ask questions, so I'll post this link to spare people from explaining: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KerbalSpaceProgram
<richfiles> I Miss Luna
<Stallion_of_War> flutter_spin: I can't remember what either of the other two stream, but Wrek streams best music
<Mish> Nittany_Discord: you might wanna try Pyschonauts. I play it because the comdey and design drives me forward in the gameplay <3
<Kimori> I was really disappointed
<Woodenshy|WINNING> hmmmmmmmmm
<Woodenshy|WINNING> off to bed.
<Stallion_of_War> Could be because it's 0050 EST
<Woodenshy|WINNING> night
<Stallion_of_War> :D
<flutter_spin> I say its 'interesting' just because I'm more of an Octavia classics man
<Bluestrom_S> get version 0.15.2 its much better than 0.13 because they added two moons! and space planes
<CupcakeWarrior> Microphone!
<Woodenshy|WINNING> sorry guys, I'm really gonna go to bed.
<Ponies47> ponibas: I am just freakin pissed of at my dad. I'm such a idiot for buying those dumb books for him :|
<Stallion_of_War> Goodnight Wondershy
<Kimori> I was thinking that spyro couldive gone with a big hit
<Kimori> before he made the tf into what he is now
<Kimori> But that never happened :/
<CupcakeWarrior> I would totally watch a stream of just Nittany dusting things
<Mish> Nittany_Discord: <3 you, wrek and Superbrony are mah fave mowds

<Stallion_of_War> it was so cute
<Buytoast> Smash your mic with a hammer.
<ponibas> who was talking about the Ocarina yesterday?
<Buytoast> That's what I do.
<Reikim> Stallion_of_War: So I guess you don't live in Canada.
<Pony_9001> kerbal space program.
<Pony_9001> lolwutg
<Buytoast> And when I buy the new one to replace it, it works good as new!
<Stallion_of_War> Eenope
<Reikim> Stallion_of_War: although I'm not sure...is insulin free in the US?
<CupcakeWarrior> What is a kerbal?
<ponibas> hell no
<drfsupercenter> 03god dang it, I can't get torrent webUI's to work on my server
<Stallion_of_War> I don't know; I was making a joke that the Lee Newton pony was so cute it gave me diabeetus
<richfiles> Free prescription drugs? What is this, any other civilized country but the USA?
<Blaze_Anderson> yea, but skylanders has to many characters to play as, and once you get most of them, you cant decide on who to play as in it.
<Reikim> ^
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: use duct tape and if it still doesnt work then use more duct tape
<Stallion_of_War> See, Drug companies -> Bribe the government
<richfiles> ^ Red Gree tech
<richfiles> Red Green I menat
<richfiles> GAHAHHAH! Typos!
<cachi01> lol
<Stallion_of_War> Goverment x Bribes
<Reikim> Although I must be honest and say that I'm not entirely sure how diabetics are compensated by the government. Thankfully, I've never been sick in such a way.
<ponibas> jsut go to bed now? they'll only get worse
<ponibas> dammit! they're contagious!
<otakon> so, game not working?
<richfiles> Twilight! NOOOOO! :$ don't use the illiteracy curse on the rokfdkfdsjjhdf
<ponibas> i think he restarted
<Reikim> Intermission music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMQdkL-cfGM
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> I am so sorry ponies, but there was something i had to do after tonights B Movie.... http://paladin-drakkenwolf.deviantart.com/art/ScootaBow-307240793
<otakon> nice
<Reikim> ^
<flutter_spin> that was pretty quick Paladin_Drakkenwolf
<Reikim> Scootaloo learning how to fly.
<Nittany_Discord> Stupid action is stupid.
<Nittany_Discord> Pushed a button to turn my internet off.
<ponibas> lol, nice
<flutter_spin> I did that before Nit
<Kimori> really? I havent had that problem
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Stallion_of_War> Scootaloo needs to visit Assassin's Creed II Leonardo
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> flutter_spin: actually it was like 2 hours cause I kept looking up to watch the movie
<Kimori> but I don't have a whole lot of skylanders
<flutter_spin> It usually takes me 10 hours to draw something and I have to refer to something
<Stallion_of_War> http://i45.tinypic.com/21twkw.jpg
<Stallion_of_War> Dat Lee pony
*Stallion_of_War so cute!
<flutter_spin> I don't get it Stallion_of_War
<Stallion_of_War> Watch Sourcefed
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> oh
<Stallion_of_War> (BTW Left -> Right Elliott, Lee, Joe)
<CupcakeWarrior> STREEEAM
<Reikim> lol at the WinRar "Not free" screen
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol winrar, no1 ever buys that
<Reikim> Makes me laugh every time I use it.
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Stallion_of_War> I've had an odd urge to stream me doing stuff recently. Not that anypony would watch because I can't stream it here... but...
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03the server is going at like dialup speeds
<CupcakeWarrior> You could get a livestream account
<Shamroc> CupcakeWarrior: in vegas
<Kandarihu> Oh, is that Nittany_Discord streaming?
<CupcakeWarrior> I know
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03!lag
<Stallion_of_War> What's the point of streaming if nopony would watch... NOPONY WHATSOEVER
<drfsupercenter> 03ugh
<ScriptBot> [drfsupercenter] Lag with island.lugia.us is 3.292secs
<Reikim> And then I played the exact same game that Nitt is streaming.
<flutter_spin> I've always wondered about "doing X" but then I usually shrug it off and do something completely unexpected and random
<Blaze_Anderson> yea, plus, if you have completed the game, all you can really do is run around, and play multiplayer, which is pointless if no one wants to play with you.
<richfiles> Almost as exciting as SuperBrony64's Wii Shop chanel streams! :$ :D
<Biglaw> I discovered that BronyState isn't blocked at my school
<Biglaw> :3
<Shizuka> 13why so ping
<Biglaw> Shizuka because we wub woo
<Kimori> Someone here plays the multiplayer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know why, but my rear mic jack is disabled.
<Kimori> I don't, kept having issues with it
<MahBoi777> Biglaw: winning!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> use the front...?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno how to enable it right now, which is bad.
<flutter_spin> I recall my brother telling me he couldn't play with me for a couple months because he had to build an addtion to his house. So instead, I watched ponies. Go figure.
<richfiles> Weird. Giggle at it and maybe the tech ghosties will leave! :O
<ponibas> device manager?
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: Did you buy this game?
<Ponies47> Biglaw: Neither was it at my middle school. I hope it isn't for highschool either
<Shizuka> 13recording devices, properties, use this device probably
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. It's free right now.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Tried that.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Okay, enough of this damn heat, I'm turning on the AC
<richfiles> Seapony Lyra plz
<Biglaw> Ponies47 Highschool lunches just got 20% cooler
<flutter_spin> what's free?
<Reikim> So I have no idea what I'm doing but whatever.
<flutter_spin> I like free.
<Biglaw> flutter_spin air?
<ponibas> paladin, i've not stopped using my AC since.. early april =/
<richfiles> Oh hai Dashie! :D is your pal Seapony Lyra here?
<Stallion_of_War> Nittany_Discord: I don't know if this helps, but my audio on Win7 is a bit derpy. I have to reset the primary/default audio jack every time I switch between my headphones and the HDMI port. I don't know, but maybe it's something like that for microphones?
<Kandarihu> I think it would be a good idea to bring some greater awareness of Magicka while it's on sale.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't switch between port.
<Reikim> Oh hey there
<Reikim> Building a rocket
<Blaze_Anderson> like what?
<Reikim> Fun stuff
<richfiles> Too the mOOOOOOOONnnnnannanAAAA
<Biglaw> hey there Reikim, and... TO THE MOOOOOOOONNNN!!!!
<Kimori> couldnt connect my portal to the computer properly
<Stallion_of_War> Nittany_Discord: Don't underestimate teh power of windows to do random crap
<richfiles> LOL! A window into Tartarus
<richfiles> :$
<Stallion_of_War> I saw a "Set as default" thing there
<otakon> hmmmm
<drfsupercenter> 03the frick
<otakon> hiya Rainbow Dash!
<drfsupercenter> 03now the RDNS isn't even working?
<otakon> bye Rainbow Dash
<Kandarihu> I see you have Magicka and some of the DLC
<Stallion_of_War> Nittany_Discord: The button above the OK button on the mane screen
<drfsupercenter> 03oh wait, I know why.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Got it.
<drfsupercenter> 03I ran into this before
<drfsupercenter> 03if I turn Windows Firewall off, it breaks the entire thing
<richfiles> I wish Dashie would drag out Seapony Lyra! Squee! :D
<CupcakeWarrior> I dont hear anything
<Biglaw> some people have professional mics for streaming, I have a USB rock band mic
<CupcakeWarrior> Same here
<Biglaw> :p
<Stallion_of_War> It seems to disable my speakers without listing them as... it's 0115, my brain's not working...
<Stallion_of_War> Hope you figure it out. Time for bed. (I hope I dream of Princess Luna :$)
<Kandarihu> My laptop's internal mic is good enough for me. Too bad my speakers aren't as good.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Ahhhhh AC, you are my best friend atm
<Biglaw> I think I'm gonna go to bed before my brain becomes 100% derp
<CupcakeWarrior> My laptop has an internal mic, but it only works on Linux for some reason
<Stallion_of_War> I should do my BRIAN BLESSED voice right now... it's not like everyone's sleeping or anything
<Stallion_of_War> ...
<Biglaw> 1I think I'm gonna go to bed before my brain becomes 100% derp
<Biglaw> oops
<Biglaw> See you all tomorrow!
<flutter_spin> I took a 30min nap 4 hours ago, but I might fall asleep too
<Stallion_of_War> Goodnight everypony!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Biglaw: Dream of Ponies

<ponibas> awesome song.. shitty intro
<CupcakeWarrior> Hooray, my internal mic works now!
<Blaze_Anderson> oh, that is a problem, thats why i always get the console version of things, but the wii one i just dont get.
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: I actually like songs with those kind of noises
<Kimori> I bought the wii version because I wanted a wireless portal
<Sumica> 00,10that intro was not song it was just bad noise that eventaly became song. once it was all song it was good.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My sound settings are messed up.
<Sumica> 00,10the intro was painfull
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My speakers won't function now.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14is that Tool?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<Tassadork> hmm, well we're hearing your tunes...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate that I have technical difficulties half the time I stream.
<CupcakeWarrior> dat bad luck
<Kandarihu> Do you think you might consider doing some Magicka?
<flutter_spin> Holy crap. 280 thumbs up on the new fic in like an hour? That's crazy.
<Kandarihu> I'm probably going to buy my copy tomorrow morning.
<flutter_spin> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/31089/The-Three-Sisters ... too bad its a sad fic. I don't like them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can someone help me. I used to never have this problem.
<flutter_spin> Never learned how to stream. Can't help ya
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: How old is your computer?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,016+ years
<Kandarihu> So we're hearing the music but you're not hearing it?
<CupcakeWarrior> Maybe its just dying
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not sure if it's dying.
<Merc_Xephos> ello
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hasn't show any signs of dying.
<Kandarihu> CupcakeWarrior: speakers aren't a neccessary part of a computer
<Kimori> hey I'm going to head off
<CupcakeWarrior> True
<Tassadork> window's sound routing is actually really, really bad
<Kandarihu> Is this a laptop you're on or a desktop?
<Kimori> ill probably be back on tomorrow, see yous
<twilight_sprinkle> lets cremate it
<CupcakeWarrior> He has a desktop
<Tassadork> programs will choose outputs, and it's really difficult to change'
<Merc_Xephos> i went on tv, and some one diised us on a late show!
<CupcakeWarrior> What channel?
<Merc_Xephos> dissed*
<Merc_Xephos> idk
<CupcakeWarrior> What show was it?
<Kandarihu> As in dissing bronies, or the community of Bronystate?
<Merc_Xephos> that mutherfuking piece o shit
<Merc_Xephos> bronies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think it's VAC.
<richfiles> VAC?
<Blaze_Anderson> ok bye.
<Kandarihu> Oh. Have you tried restarting Steam?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have Steam running.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01VAC = Virtual Audio Cable.
<Litwick> Well I partied like a Pinkie Pie today.
<CupcakeWarrior> Hi Litwick
<Kandarihu> Oh, okay.
<richfiles> Just one :O
<Kandarihu> I wonder if restarting the computer might help.
<diddutz> My sound card died a while ago...
<Reikim> So I launched a rocket. And killed all my astronauts.
<Litwick> Everypony wish my mtoher a happy birthday right now! I want to give her a gift of a different variety!
<Reikim> Happy b-day Litwick's mom!
<Ninjazz> Happy birthday to Litwick's mom! :D

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Happy birthday, mother of Litwick
<Reikim> Do we have streamception again?
<richfiles> Happy birthday Lit's mom! :)
<richfiles> I can see FOREVER! :O
*Reikim yawns
<Litwick> I told my mother about what I did she said "And why did you do that?"
<CupcakeWarrior> What did you do?
<Litwick> My response? "Because I could."
<Litwick> CupcakeWarrior: I told the chat to wish my mtoher a happy birthday. Cuz I'm sweet and shit.
<diddutz> Because ponies, thats why!
<Kandarihu> We're hearing more music. You?
<AlejrandoMoist> For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead, Litwick ?
<CupcakeWarrior> Does she know youre a brony?
<Kandarihu> Oh, this intro again
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I might cut stream due to tech difficulties.
<Reikim> Oh, it's Virtual Audio Cable.
<Litwick> AlejandroMoist: HA HA HA HA STAYIN ALIVE~ STAYING ALIVE~
<Reikim> Aw
<Kandarihu> Let's see if restarting your computer helps.
<CupcakeWarrior> Litwick: Does she know you like ponies?
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: What's the problem?
<Litwick> Told her about it a month ago :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No sound.
<Litwick> She didn't mind.
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: But we're getting sound.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not.
<CupcakeWarrior> His speakers died, or something
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<Kandarihu> That's the crazy thing about it.
<CupcakeWarrior> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> Everyone refresh
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's transmitting sound, but it's not sending anything to my speakers.
<otakon> lol
<Reikim> From what I see, the speakers aren't getting sound...wonder why.
<Reikim> Hm.
<Reikim> It. Is a mystery.
*Reikim strokes moustache
<Kandarihu> Maybe it's a problem with the speakers or the connection
<Tassadork> is the app that should be sending sound listed in the mixer for your speakers?
<Bee3ry> Clearly, a beaver has stolen the input cable
<CupcakeWarrior> Bronystate isnt working for me now :(
<Reikim> A beaver? Nitt's Canadian now?
<Bee3ry> No. But the beaver spy network has long claws. and sharp teeth
<Reikim> And a very large tail.
<Om> CupcakeWarrior: A fate worse than death.
<Tassadork> secret bases in dams around the world
<Reikim> But why would the beavers target us?
<Tassadork> jealous of ponies getting all the love?
<Bee3ry> Because we forsook them... forsaken? forsaked?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are beavers in Pennsylvania.
<Reikim> Right the first time.
<Tassadork> where are the my little beaver plushies
<Bee3ry> because we cannot conjugate the verb forsake!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> There are beavers in my state as well
<CupcakeWarrior> I did not know that bronystate had a technical difficulties video
<Ponies47> My stream is a Youtube vid of Derpy upside down and it says BronyState we are currently experiencing technical difficultis.
<Tassadork> with classy music from sim city
<Ponies47> UGGGH SIM CITY! :[
<Reikim> I like this video. Who made it?
<CupcakeWarrior> Is Sim City good?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> o lord I just realize
<Tassadork> dunno. barely played it, but the soundtrack to sim city 4 is divine
<Ponies47> CupcakeWarrior: Nope.avi. It's boring :|
<CupcakeWarrior> Well someone doesnt like simulation games
<Reikim> I think I just might. Thanks Derpy.
*Avis-Esk skips around
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Bee3ry> there's nothing quite like building an interlinked highway system, tall skyscrapers... and then unleashing Godzilla on it
<CupcakeWarrior> I think Shizuka made the video
<Shizuka> 13which
<AlejrandoMoist> pong!
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Shamroc> oh hai Shizuka
<Reikim> This one, Shizu.
<Shizuka> 13technical derpiculties~
<Reikim> Yes we are, thanks Derpy
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Bee3ry: I havent played sim city since the 2000 edition, are meteors a form of natural distster?
<Bee3ry> Don't be silly. Meteors are just the universal equivalent of "urban redevelopment"
<Bee3ry> Now, locusts...
<Triple> o-o
<Kandarihu> Are you hearing that? Because we're hearing that.
<AlejrandoMoist> locusts <3
<pinkyspice> o-o
<Triple> derpy is upside down lol thats ok
<Shizuka> 13anyway yes i made this video for exactly this kind of situation
<pinkyspice> why is derpy on?
<Chimera> nya
<Bee3ry> Derpy is upside down, and all is right with the world
<Triple> D:
<Shamroc> Shizuka: is good video to explain that somepony fucked up
<Reikim> It's a fun vid, Shizu. Makes waiting not terrible.
<AlejrandoMoist> Shizuka is always prepared for derpiculties emergency
<Triple> everyone enjoying the show
<Triple> what show?
<Triple> XD
<CupcakeWarrior> Everyone loves you Shizuka
<Dark_of_Max> D:
<Reikim> She's the resident tech goddess. It's part of her portfolio to be prepared for derpiculties.
<Bee3ry> makes me want some more muffin stew
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Dark_of_Max> hi every 1 c:
<Reikim> Tech and screwups are inseparable.
<Shizuka> 13though i'm more proud of the railings animatic and my demo reel
<richfiles> LOL... :D Minnesota news... Slow day I guess... Why to mosquitos cause red lumps! :D Well, you see... :)
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> pfft railings
<Shizuka> 13the awards show was too much stress for me to properly like
<Reikim> The demo reel has some of the best music ever.
<FlareChaser> Diablo 3 is nice! :D HEY KIDS! I'm Back! :D
<CupcakeWarrior> Hey FlareChaser, enjoying the technical derpiculties?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> oh there you are Flare
<AlejrandoMoist> Shizuka, what was the trippy pong game in your demo reel
<Shizuka> 13plasma pong
<Kandarihu> Well, you did a good job on that video.
<Shamroc> FlareChaser: buy me that
<Saturn> 08,01finally level 60 \o/
<FlareChaser> CupcakeWarrior: Actually, everything was fine :)
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: all fixed?
<AlejrandoMoist> sounds fancy
<FlareChaser> Saturn: after a year and a half.
<Shizuka> 13google it, the guy got C&D'd by atari so you can't get it from the developer anymore
<Ghosties> 04Scary image o.o
<Shizuka> 13but it might be mirrored somewhere
<FlareChaser> Shamroc: it was $62...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Finally.
<Saturn> 08,01and now i discover that i need to have cataclysm to fly in EK and Kalimdor...
<Tassadork> we got stream!
<AlejrandoMoist> Shizuka, why would they do that?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> alrighty
<CupcakeWarrior> Yay stream
<Shizuka> 13atari owns the trademark to "pong"
<WorldTraveler> what won the lottery?
<Om> SOUND!
<Shizuka> 13also refresh
<Reikim> Yay~!
<Kandarihu> We can hear your mic loud and clear.
<ponibas> WoW was so last year =p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Fucking trademark abuse.
<Saturn> 08,01FlareChaser: well, technically after 1.5 months
<Reikim> Shizuka: Found it, on some random site.
<Saturn> 08,01because that's how long i've been playing for
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Saturn: dont buy Cataclysm, just do what I did when it came out, and quit WoW all together
<Shizuka> 13AlejrandoMoist: but basically it's much like zenimax suing mojang over "scrolls", they have to defend their marks
<CupcakeWarrior> Hey there Nittany's voice!
<FlareChaser> Saturn: What xpacs do you have? :D
<hen3ry_at_law> Trademark issues?
*DeathStar dances
<Saturn> 08,01FlareChaser: burning crusade, for some reason
<WorldTraveler> what won the lottery?
<ponibas> nowai
<Saturn> 08,01no idea why; didn't buy it
<Shizuka> 13problem is the plasma pong guy was C&D'd in like 2006 or 2008, but i have the last version he did
<ponibas> BC comes with WoW now
<Saturn> 08,01Paladin_Drakkenwolf: why would i do that?
<Reikim> http://download.cnet.com/Plasma-Pong/3000-2099_4-10511143.html Because I know some people are too lazy to google.
<Saturn> 08,01WoW is one of the only games i enjoy playing
<ponibas> and it's free till 2
<AlejrandoMoist> I'm sure I can find it somewhere
<ponibas> 20*

<hen3ry_at_law> WorldTraveler: some DMV workers in Missouri.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Saturn: eh, everyone has their drug game, mine used to be WoW, but Cataclysm kinda ruined it for me
<Kandarihu> We can hear you.
<Reikim> Hey again Alister.
<AlejrandoMoist> We're watching the Star Wars Holiday Special next week
<Shizuka> 13good volume
<FlareChaser> Saturn: agreed, but after a while is gets boring, but then Blizz releases a new patch.

<AlejrandoMoist> what is this?
<Kandarihu> Is there multiplayer to this game?
<FlareChaser> Saturn: I'm going to download the EU version of WoW :D
<Reikim> Skip the tutorial like a boss.
<AlejrandoMoist> Yet
<AlejrandoMoist> but soon
<AlejrandoMoist> SOON
<Reikim> Nitt, skip it.
<ponibas> I might pick it bacn up for abit when Mists comes out
<CupcakeWarrior> So whats this game about?
<Reikim> You don't need to know how to play!
<WorldTraveler> so I'm wondering what movies won
<Saturn> 08,01if i could draw, i'd draw my OC with a penguin, telling it "i wish i could quit you"
<Saturn> 08,01do any of you know Millenium Alone?
<Alister> no
<Reikim> Add a crapton of solid-fuel boosters, and screw with the pitch/yaw/etc.
<CupcakeWarrior> Do you just build a rocket?
<DeathStar> Saturn: I could try drawing that ^-^
<Saturn> 08,01DeathStar: dooo eeet!
<WorldTraveler> anypony?
<FlareChaser> lolnope
<Om> Penguins are op.
<Saturn> 08,01WorldTraveler: look on the news
<Reikim> Single-click.

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> in before his rocket explodes and KILLS EVERYONE
<Saturn> 08,01front page of the site
<WorldTraveler> its not on yet
<AlejrandoMoist> DeathStar, include argyle socks somewhere in there
<Alister> There's two flarechasers ?

<AlejrandoMoist> lrod
<Saturn> 08,01Magical Max and the LEgend of the Ring
<Saturn> 08,01aye, that's the one
<CupcakeWarrior> Sounds dumb
<Alister> I remember seeing Zombieland in the theaters when it came out. It was nice
<WorldTraveler> I never get picked..... *sad face*
<pinkyspice> Saturn: i petition a reroll tomorrow
<richfiles> LOL, I wasn't too far off! :$
<Saturn> 08,01pinkyspice: there will be no reroll
<WorldTraveler> That's why we need lottery WEEK
<Saturn> 08,01it was chosen fair and square
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, Millenium Alone
<richfiles> PONIES on TV!!! Yay! :(
<Saturn> 08,01it's a song
<AlejrandoMoist> Saturn, what happens if both the A and B movie get WMC'd?
<Alister> Woah let's calm down kids
<Reikim> Thank God I didn't get picked. Then you guys would be watching corny Japanese live-action movies.
<pinkyspice> i wonder how many people will stay for the b movie then
<Saturn> 08,01imagine it being played on acoustic guitar and cello
<WorldTraveler> Saturn do you still have movie picks?
<Saturn> 08,01because that's what i was doing earlier
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: So this is a rocket building game?
<WorldTraveler> i.e the movies everyone picked?
<Saturn> 08,01AlejrandoMoist: we pick new moview
<WorldTraveler> do you guys still have the list
<Saturn> 08,01somewhere
<FlareChaser> my drug games: all my my games.
<Reikim> Saturn: You have to record that cello/guitar cover.
<Saturn> 08,01well, for backlog, to to the backlog page
<WorldTraveler> can we have lottery week?
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: i'm going to
<Reikim> This is good.
<Saturn> 08,01next week some time, if i can get access to the recording studio
<richfiles> Does anyone here have a functioning Sega Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01richfiles: i don't, but i know someone who does
<WorldTraveler> I mean like using everyone's pick for that week, you pick 10 winners. 5 A movies and 5 B movies
<Alister> Well , this is getting boring. I,m gonna go to bed. Reikim Bronysith FlareChaser|Diablo3 good night to you my best buds. We'd just need two more person to have our ''mane'' cast. anyway good night
<WorldTraveler> so they can be shown Mon-Fri
<Reikim> Take the SAS unit for fun stuff.
<FlareChaser> Alister: night! wait what?
<WorldTraveler> as part of a Lottery week
<Bronysith> Alister: NIGHT
<richfiles> I have one, with all 3 Panzer Dragoon games! and 2 or 3 Shining games! :)
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Alister: Dream of Ponies
<Reikim> name it the Luna
<Reikim> Name it the Luna!
<Reikim> Oh wait, stream lag, I'm too late.
<WorldTraveler> but what if luna explodes?
<Alister> Paladin_Drakkenwolf: one time I had a dream where I fought a giant rock spider while twilight assisted me with her magic. I can't top that
<Reikim> And night Alister
<hen3ry_at_law> It can't be the Luna. It won't make it to the moon with only one stage
<CupcakeWarrior> inb4 he dies
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> inb4 everyone dies
<Reikim> Alister: Yes you can. You can do so with badass future Twilight.
<Saturn> 08,01i think Luna would be the most comfortable pony to ride
<Alister> Now i wanna where the rocket goes before going to bed
<WorldTraveler> Escape from Manehattan
<Reikim> But those wings, Saturn. Getting in the way.
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: normal size ponies are tiny
<diddutz> Don't do it like the Koreans!
<WorldTraveler> saturn dat inneuendo
<Reikim> True dat, but that's only if we assume that we know their size.
<Saturn> 08,01WorldTraveler: no innuendo
<Om> Pew pew?
<Sumica> 00,10well the plus side is even if you die on the pad you still got 63m
<richfiles> Oh noes... Hurt horse on TV! Swollen tendon, missed chance to beat a record not touched since '78 :'(
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 ponies are actually 2 stories tall, and everything on their world is scaled to match
<WorldTraveler> what game is this?
<Phase4> 00,02SPAAACE!
<Reikim> If we pretend that ponies can be ridden by humans, Saturn, then Rarity would be most comfortable to ride, because she would be wearing a comfortable saddle.
<hen3ry> Just launch!
<ponibas> spaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
<Saturn> 08,01i love horses
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> you gonna die son
<Saturn> 08,01any horse riders in?
<hen3ry> 5 4 3 2 1 blastoff
<Sumica> 00,10beep boop son, beep boop
*AlejrandoMoist isn't a horse rider
<Reikim> Isn't Nittany the one who streamed Orbiter that one time? And screwed up horribly?
<CupcakeWarrior> Ive never rode a horse befor
<Saturn> 08,01neither have i
<AlejrandoMoist> I'm nowhere near any horses
<Saturn> 08,01but i want to learn
<WorldTraveler> is this Orbiter?
<Saturn> 08,01maybe this summer
<Sumica> 00,10Horseback rideing is fun out here in the cooler months
<richfiles> I've been on a horse years ago.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> staying up for launch
<ponibas> your crew looks scared
<WorldTraveler> I AM a horse....
<Saturn> 08,01AlejrandoMoist: i'm in the countryside, so i have 3 or 4 different riding schools close to me to choose from
<CupcakeWarrior> My mom says I have, but I think I would remember something like that
<Om> That would be a funny fic to read. Some dude gets put in Eqestria, and is only the size of a ponies fore leg. Or smaller
<Alister> Ok I think I got some of the roles down in our ''mane cast'' Me : Twilight. FlareChaser|Diablo3 : Rainbow Dash. Reikim : Pinkie and Bronysith : uhhh AppleJack ? idk you decide sith
<AlejrandoMoist> Saturn, is your countryside have dark skies?
<Reikim> I'm Pinkie? When did that happen?
<Bronysith> Alister: ugh
<richfiles> I had a mosquito drink itself to death on my arm. It drank till it exploded, then flew away. The blood hit my OTHER arm! :O
<WorldTraveler> ponies are about the size of a golden retreiver
<AlejrandoMoist> *doe
<Saturn> 08,01Alister: you missed out me as Pinkie Pie

<Reikim> Saturn: Too late, I am.
<Alister> Reikim: you said so yourself earlier
*Reikim puts on hat
<Saturn> 08,01AlejrandoMoist: it's scotland, not hades.
<Alister> CupcakeWarrior: why ?
<CupcakeWarrior> I would be Guyra
<Reikim> Oh yeah...
<WorldTraveler> Scoltland
<Sumica> 00,10You are playing roles?
<CupcakeWarrior> Alister: Bronysith loves Molestia
<Alister> FlareChaser|Diablo3: cuz your OC is a pegasus

<Shamroc> and then runs outa gas
<Reikim> Press T Nitt
<Saturn> 08,01WorldTraveler: exploding is a vital technique for any form of locamotion
<AlejrandoMoist> Are you saying that for a good astronomy site, I have to go to the underworld?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Alister: XD

<ACS13123> YOU OBVIOUSLY LOVE OREOS!
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> Sumica: you only live once
<OneTrickPony> #YOLO

<Rain> lawl
<CupcakeWarrior> dat Sumica logic
<Shamroc> Sumica: YOLO is just another excuse for people to do dumb shit

<Rain> lol
<Om> Hmmm. it needs, something... More...
<Shamroc> Sumica: inb4 it just implodes killing the planet
<AlejrandoMoist> We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
<OneTrickPony> I think NASA should fund this
<KiwiBoi777> Om: but what?
<Shamroc> ...then they died
<Rain> you know, its better to be thicker at the bottom, that way you arent top heavy >_>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01AlejrandoMoist: I wish I lived in the 60's.
<Om> KiwiBoi777: Its tough to say... But, I think. rockets? And lots of them
<ponibas> zepplins in a dead heat?
<AlejrandoMoist> First the Moon, then we go to Equestria
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 BOOM
<Rain> but top heavy = falling XD
<KiwiBoi777> hmmmmm, moar rockets would probably help
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It'll be 20 years before we touch the moon again, and that's if private industry doesn't fail.
<StupidSexyCarambola> inb4 everything went better than expected
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica liek big BOOM
<Om> Yes MOAR!
<KiwiBoi777> YAY
<AlejrandoMoist> Yes Sumica, make the number of rockets dwarf the rockets up top
<Rain> Im saying that 12 rockets on the top is a bad idea XD

<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: take the struts off the bottom
<Bluestrom_S> Nittany_Discord use simple designs for your rocket, more doesn't mean better it just make the whole thing complicated
<Rain> Sumica, when you start, dont go full thrust right out of the gate. Start low and work up

<Ponies47> Sumica: DANG IT! IT'S 3:35 AM AND I GOTTA HOLD IN MY LAUGHING! :D
<Vinyer> even if the screen cracks
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> Polydunami: ;)
<AlejrandoMoist> Rain, if they go later, than we get less power, and therefore an inferior rocket
<Lighty> 06maybe because of the compact design? like, no space underneath the housing?
<Rain> but if the all go at once, they will blow up XD
<AlejrandoMoist> LOLOLOLOLLOL
<Dark_of_Max> ka booom
<Rain> O____O
<Vinyer> not sure
<metalzeldabrony> a lot of error
<Northbrony> lol

<Polydunami> What the hell!? xD
<AlejrandoMoist> Sumica didn't secure the rockets
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> i think ya forgot the connecters Sumica
<Vinyer> or simply i products are too simplistic to break
<thegt90> ah ha ha ha
<Om> We know one thing.
<StupidSexyCarambola> Sumica: are you secretly Michael Bay?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat feeling when you are looking for an anime and every link is for megaupload....

<AlejrandoMoist> Sumica, you didn't have enough railings
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> Sumica: add more secure rods
<Rain> Use connectors on the outer most rockets
<Polydunami> Ugh, megaupload
<Lighty> 06but, i.e. an iPhone or HTC HD 2 arent really phones you want to break, right?
<ponibas> way too much science in that
<Vinyer> not sure
*Phase4` hardly noticed when megaupload went down
<Irish_Pony> Welp gtg cyall
<Phase4`> oh wow
