<Amu-chan> Sometimes when I work on projects that involve some form of programming, I totally get caught up in them and lose track of time myself... Although lately I limit myself from doing such things in the evening/night time, because it seems that's the time I'm most prone to losing track of time...
<CrazyHippie> ^
<Barbetos|AtWork> No no no.
<weegee2062> yes
<Barbetos|AtWork> Those are Monk Ninjas.

<Barbetos|AtWork> I forget the internet and its workings some times. Forgive me.
<CrazyHippie> Barbetos|AtWork: Hard to tell on the internet :/

<Meanwhile> He looks like Petrelli.
<Barbetos|AtWork> See also trolling.
<CrazyHippie> What is that?

<Barbetos|AtWork> I dunno. Something that is meant to make "u mad"
*Bronysith locks prince-dari in a room with tennant

<MadSurge> :D it's Time Turner!
<thelonepony> Night*
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Michael. :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> CrazyHippie: Honestly though I probably would of kept it up, but I realized that I really do like Dr. Who to much to be convincing.
<Bronysith> http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/Empty-child-dragoncon-2012-330685719
<weegee2062> but night
<pony_458032> MadSurge: timmy turner?
<weegee2062> toby tuner
<Meanwhile> That man needs a dentist.
<CrazyHippie> Barbetos|AtWork: Who doesnt like Doctor Who?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Crab People.
<weegee2062> i don't know
<CrazyHippie> I like the lobster people better
<Stormy> I really wanted to do php for the group project we're doing this semester
<Stormy> But the professor is a RoR fanboy
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> php is fast and easy. its not elegant, but its got massive support.
<Stormy> So I'm just doing other php stuff on the side
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its been around forever.
<weegee2062> the shell fish people ar cool thought
<Meanwhile> I tire of nakedness.
<CrazyHippie> Just drop it Rose
<Bronysith> suddenly i crave steak
<CrazyHippie> Great now I have the same craving
<weegee2062> i crave pasta
<CrazyHippie> Stop making me hungry!
<purple_squid> I crave the blood of a virgin....I mean pasta.
<AJIsAwesome> ....
<Dark_Horst> whatever it is these british folks put in their tea, it must be hardcore
<CrazyHippie> oooooooK?
<Bronysith> CrazyHippie: how does saying steak make you hungry?
<Bronysith> steak and fries
<CrazyHippie> Bronysith: I didn't eat lunch yet :(
<Bronysith> or a steak and baked potato
<Dark_Horst> bloody jucy tender steak
<Dark_Horst> there
<CrazyHippie> ahaha
<Bronysith> medium rare steak is best
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> You can format your php code to look nice though and make it easy to read.
<Dark_Horst> ^
<dynamo2814> medium well is best
<Bronysith> i also enjoy taking fries, adding pulled pork ontop of that with shredded cheese and ranch dressing
<Stormy> mine's probably awful
<weegee2062> i can't eat steak it's too rought
<Stormy> I really have no plan or anything, I just write as I go along
<Bronysith> HA
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I have become partial to the codeigniter framework
<Bronysith> Beef glorious BEEF
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its a framework for php web apps that doesnt get in your way.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> MVC style
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but flexible.
<Bronysith> and bison
<Bronysith> bison meat is awesome
<Stormy> hm, interesting
<dynamo2814> bison....what!?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and you can put php code anywhere you want, its not restrictive.
<CrazyHippie> and dog
<weegee2062> no eating natives
<Dark_Horst> where do you get bison?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and no stupid templating crap
<CrazyHippie> there now I'm not hjungry anymore
<dynamo2814> where do you live
<Amu-chan> I had an IRC bot that I coded myself... The code for it was pretty messy if I recall correctly...
<Bronysith> i aint telling you shit
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so its super fast, because its just executing php and not wasting cycles on a templating engine
<CrazyHippie> Earth what about you?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I coded an irc bot framework in php
<Bronysith> yea i live on earth
<Bronysith> Bison is great meat though
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> it was like 60% done, it just needs some polish
<Amu-chan> Oh, cool!
<weegee2062> i live in equestria
<dynamo2814> alrighty then
<CrazyHippie> I'll try Bison one day
<CrazyHippie> RAW
<prince-dari> Was that MrBot?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I could give you a copy if you wanted to look at it or improve it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> MrBot was written in autoit
<alexxm> have fun
<Shizuka> 13evil maids?
<weegee2062> were
<CrazyHippie> evil monks
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I actually did something quite funny a few weeks ago
<Dark_Horst> dis dude be trippin
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I took 4 years worth of irc chatlogs from #laserchat on ecnet
<CrazyHippie> oooh girl I love your eyes!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> ran them through some scripts i wrote
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and created a bot that would respond what typical responses were for questions asked in those 4 years
<weegee2062> and it's awsome
<RedDragonX> you would
<prince-dari> Hah
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> It was pretty awesome
<CrazyHippie> Those eyes are so....pitch black
<Amu-chan> That sounds pretty cool. XD
<weegee2062> eyup
<prince-dari> Bad wolf...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I think there were 500mb worth of logs
<weegee2062> eyup
<Meanwhile> The big bad wolf.
<RedDragonX> now where is Kjackings, with him here my life would be oh so complete
<Stormy> lol
<dynamo2814> pair of contacts like that would be cool
<weegee2062> dalek
<Bronysith> Shinji got so red from kissing asuka, how funny
<prince-dari> Lupus deus est.
<CrazyHippie> dynamo2814: Wake someone up with those contcts on in the middle of the night
<prince-dari> This ep as so much foreshadowing
<Stormy> I thought you didn't like Kjakings
<prince-dari> Bad wolf, Torchwood
<dynamo2814> oh yeah, that'd hilarious
<RedDragonX> I dont' like the way he acts in general no but he is still entertaining lol
<Bronysith> torchwood is an anagram for doctor who, everyone and their mothers were saying this at dragoncon
<weegee2062> i don;t see how tht works
<RedDragonX> now I'm distracted by this sports illustrated
<CrazyHippie> Transformers! Werewolves in disguise

<CriticKitten> The Docta~
<Amu-chan> I generally don't stay into MMO type games very long... so I never bother with pay to play MMOs.
<Meanwhile> Monkey monk monks.
<CrimsonPhoenix> BOOKS
<CriticKitten> Is my volume too low, or is the stream volume strangely low?
<RedDragonX> I just got out of playing TOR for like six months, then the guild disbanded to go to Guild Wars 2
<Dark_Horst> it's READIN
<Dark_Horst> TIME
<CrimsonPhoenix> the stream volume is low
<Stormy> I think I could get really into an MMO if I found one that looked interesting
<weegee2062> books i love books
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dear princess celestia I'm so alone
<Stormy> I really like RPG types of games
<Meanwhile> Steampunk.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d3g0yif
<Stormy> I'll get obsessed with one and play for hours a day for a few weeks then get burned out and completely forget about it
<weegee2062> cursed diemonds
<Amu-chan> I have a tendency to stop playing RPGs just before the end... I like to call it the RPG curse... I'll keep playing until very close to the ending, and then suddenly something takes my attention from it and I never finish it.
<Bronysith> death
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> rpgs have a hard time keeping me engaged.
<Stormy> lately I've been playing through games in the Tales of series with a group of friends, but we don't get to play very often since we all have to be available at the same time
<Dark_Horst> POWER EXPLAINING
<Meanwhile> Trapception.

<AdamTheDuck> Hello Amelia
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Amelia
<CrimsonPhoenix> Actually
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Amelia
<CrimsonPhoenix> do tell
<Amu-chan> I prefer to wear pajamas versus old t-shirts. I find it more comfortable for me when I sleep.
<sub06905> ello Amelia
<Cades> like I'm talking from 10 years ago
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: i'm not. link me to it
<CrimsonPhoenix> what EXACTLY do you mean by comment page
<NENUDJUS> Amelia: ello
<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: but how, exclamation points dont have..organs..do they?
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause I don't think it's needed since there's a comment section for each picture
<CrimsonPhoenix> BELOW
<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: some things... you dont wana know
<Weeping> Hello.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Weeping
<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: o_o
<Amu-chan> I have quite a few old hand-me-downs from my older sister.
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: what do you mean, what do i mean? comment page is a page that lists images with their recent comments, sorting them by newest top
<Weeping-Angel> Hi.
<Cades> I don't have an older sibling. YES
<Stormy> Sometimes I wish I had an older sister to give me free clothes
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: no, not that
<otakon> hiya guys I'm back

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03because you arrived, otakon. Way to go. You killed everyone.
<Stormy> I will never ever ever fit in my little sister's stuff
<sub06905> ...
<sub06905> lol
<Stormy> Not that she needs any more clothes...
<AJIsAwesome> ........
<CrimsonPhoenix> well for one I couldn't care less for comment
<Amu-chan> The problem I have is that they often don't fit my style. They're still nice, but it's definitely not something I'd buy for myself. XD
<Dj_Cyber-4G> ELLO EVERYPONY IM FINALY BACK HOME IN THE GOOD OLD UK
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Dj_Cyber-4G. :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Dj_Cyber-4G
<thelonepony> Hi Dj_Cyber-4G
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: that'S the problem with derpibooru. imageboards are pretty dead without these pages
<CrimsonPhoenix> and two Derpibooru still is sort of new and uninformed
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hey Dj_Cyber-4G, I'm realy happy for you and imma let you finish, but Billy Mayes was the best caps user of all time! OF ALL TIME!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well Dark_Horst it's meant to archive pictures for me, not really to discuss
<Cades> yeah haha
<Dj_Cyber-4G> wut?
<sub06905> Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: but that'S what imageboards do. that'S what the name booru stands for
<thelonepony> :D
<RDash5000> *collapses in exhaustion* wassszup indernez?
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: be a better person, use bronibooru :D
<Dj_Cyber-4G> Scoot iz mah fwend o3o
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark_Horst, again Derpibooru is quite uninformed really

<Dark_Horst> madpfff, where's the fun in that?
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: ping ^
<Amu-chan> I still wear them. Mostly at home though, because I prefer to go out in something more my style.

<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: I like not running into disgusting stuff :(
<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: O_o ok, lets see it
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: you know what a filter is for, right?
<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: ∀x : ∃y ≥ x : P(y) f(x) x ∀y : ∃x : f(x) ≥ y(log(x)) if f ∘ g1 = f ∘ g2 implies g1 = g2 for all morphisms g1, g2 : x → a. if g1 ∘ f = g2 ∘ f implies g1 = g2 for all morphisms g1, g2 : b → x f : x → y and g : y → z, F(g ∘ f) = F(g) ∘ F(f) f : X → Y in C, we have ηY ∘ F(f) = G(f) ∘ ηX;
<AJIsAwesome> ......
<NENUDJUS> thats how it is done
<thelonepony> Dem Cheats wall
<Cades> Yeah I just wear pajamas at home usually, and if I go out I just throw a pair of jeans on

<NENUDJUS> dose that help?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01NENUDJUS: For each x, there exists a y greater than or equal to X such that P(y)f(x) = x. For each y, there exists and X such that f of x is greater than or equal to y times logarithm x.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And so on...
*Dj_Cyber-4G rotfls
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: the creepy images I find on there don't look too childfriendly :D

<Stormy> but I'm usually too lazy to put on makeup or spend more than 5 minutes on my hair

<Dark_Horst> kinda lucky, after months of not giving a shit i was bored one day and decided to check /b/
<AJIsAwesome> Meh. I never did like Molestia.
<Cades> Yeah it's getting cold here too
<Amu-chan> Clothing isn't so bad because I can usually find stuff I like in my size... But shoes are a pain to find in my size.

<Lunar_Brony> NewSuperBronyU my science teacher was explaining to me how we're made out of rearranged proteins, and therefore you are what you eat. I asked if why I'm not a taco. She told me I was a rearranged taco.

<Lunar_Brony> yum
<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: x → 4 x (1 – x) and y → x + y if x + y < 1 (x + y – 1
<cachi01|AFK> hey guys im back :)
<Lunar_Brony> ooohh, Borderlands 2

<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 IKR?
<HatsuneMikuFan> Welcolme back cachi01
<Kandarihu> Okay. I admit that ninjas named Zero is a bad cliche. Arctic planets are pretty much justified unless we honestly expect every inhabited planet to be at least of a temperate climate.
<Derpy_Hooves> FUCK DA POLICE
<Barbetos> Borderlands 2 Challenge. Only pick up ammo.
*Derpy_Hooves is a rebel
<Barbetos> Nothing else
<cachi01> Barbetos: holy shit
<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: wrong, a constant cant approach a variable
<Barbetos> And then some crazy person is going to do that
<Barbetos> probably me. If some one buys it for me
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: I do that all the time. :D
<Lunar_Brony> ing!
<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: no no no its right!
<Lunar_Brony> *Zing!
<oni_link> i agree Kandarihu
<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: you ay y->x+y => 0->x but constants cant approach variables

<SuperDERP> hi
<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: its chaos!
<SuperDERP> what game? who?
<FUS_RO_yay> dat mgs reference.
<Barbetos> Lunar_Brony If that is still easy then I have no reason to buy it.
<Ponies47> Thanks for the DA watch AdamTheDuck :P
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, :P
<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: and you wrote 0->1, which is also madness!!!
<Ponies47> Ohai SuperDERP

<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: displays topological mixing
<cachi01|RE6> Dark_Horst: yeah its been happening recently
<sonicdude558> Dark_Horst: here is a link to an imbed: http://www.bronystate.net/wp-content/plugins/sk_bs_theater/embed.shtml
<Lunar_Brony> Barbetos dude, I'm joking. I run out of SMG ammo sooo easily, and I have an ammo expansion~
<SuperDERP> what game is this and who is playing?
<Dark_Horst> oh nevermind... back again
<Lunar_Brony> !
<Dark_Horst> that was weird
<sonicdude558> This is a YT video of Two Best Friends Play Borderlands 2
<Dark_Horst> sonicdude558: thanks anyway. that'll be handy
<Kandarihu> I suppose if we want to be realistic and varied in our planetary binome settings, there should be planets of any kind that NASA has discovered. Including planets of less or more gravity, planets of poisonous or no atmosphere, and even gas giants.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh Tina, Borderland's Pinkie Pie.
<CrimsonPhoenix> >no shield
<sonicdude558> Thank god for A/C Cooling in the home :)
<Lunar_Brony> AdamTheDuck IKR/

<giveasmilegetasmile> kandarihu: i agree XD
<Eddmario> Well, I'm gonan go play the Submachine games. Anyone else gonna go do that as well?
<AJIsAwesome> giveasmilegetasmile: A tip: If you wanted to talk to someone directly, type part of their name in and push tab. It'll autocomplete. :)
<Wirisme> It took me way to long to figure that out
<Ponies47> Eddmario: Nope. I'm idling on TF2.
<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: The one-dimensional logistic map defined by x → 4 x (1 – x) is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits. For example, → → (or approximately 0.3454915 → 0.9045085 → 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc.
<Wirisme> too****
<Kandarihu> Like a BAWS!
<giveasmilegetasmile> oh thanks AJIsAwesome
<Barbetos> Unless it auto complete fails AJIsBestPony

<Zuxxez123> Nashville: My original ol' friend is white plank on the left in pong.
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma-:Worse. It was a couple of actors pretending to be some sort of weird parody of bronies.
<Lunar_Brony> okay, that's it. Meanwhile, you're title of The World's Tactless Man is being revoked and transferred over to NewSuperBronyU.

<Wirisme> I didn't bring it up :)
<Lunar_Brony> Wirisme try getting 3 Shine Sprites, which gives you max everything, AND do it in the middle of a boss fight when your entire party is KO'd, you have 1 health, 0 FP and 0 SP.
<CCCP> Hi CrazyHippie
<Wirisme> Well yeah I did originally
<Cades> hey
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma- : Springer deals in freak shows. No real bronies took him up, so he had to fake a couple.
<CrazyHippie> Hi CCCP
<thelonepony> hi CrazyHippie
<oni_link> I feel i should play this game. I beat the first one and then skipped all the way to Super Paper Mario, and I'm not too fond of that one, I like this style better
<[SWAG]Haku> I dont think it was staged. I think it was more likely that the people were just fans of the show, and not actual bronies
<CrazyHippie> Hi thelonepony
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane well duh
<Crystaline_Shard> Thousand year door.?
<TheKatPony> god I have to eat, later everybody
<Guest71831> Hi

<HatsuneMikuFan> Bye TheKatPony
<Zuxxez123> Cya TheKatPony
<CrazyHippie> Ello Zuxxez123
<Polydunami> Yeah, this is a fun one.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Later TheKatPony :)
<thelonepony> bye TheKatPony
*Ponies47 Huggles dat NewSuperBronyU
<[SWAG]Haku> Personally, I think the best Paper Mario is the best
<Lunar_Brony> seeya TheKatPony
<CrazyHippie> bye TheKatPony
<Crystaline_Shard> NewSuperBronyU: superpapermario is better
<Zuxxez123> I think NewSuperBronyU should mic up again. :3
<Polydunami> It's too bad, though; I have to be leaving right now.
<DocSane> [SWAG]Haku: The dude in the pink dress and tuxedo just didn't seem like he was for real.
<Wirisme> Some of the stuff they said was pretty accurate as I remember
<Lunar_Brony> seeya Polydunami
<otakon> aw bye Polydunami
<[SWAG]Haku> And the best is the original
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bye Polydunami
<thelonepony> bye Polydunami
<Wirisme> Yeah that... "cosplay"...
<[SWAG]Haku> for N64
<otakon> WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING POW BLOCK
<Wirisme> Bye Polydunami
<Polydunami> Oh wow, didn't expect so many farewells
<DocSane> Wirisme: They said nothing that couldn't be gleaned from an hour's prep on Wikipedia.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Are we STILL talking about this? :S
<superretroworld> i feel stupid asking bout the spinger late
<Zuxxez123> Why not Polydunami it's how we work!
<oni_link> Theres gonna be a 3DS one right?
<Wirisme> True DocSane
<otakon> oh OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Lunar_Brony> Crystaline_Shard it's all a matter of opinion, and the two games have radically different playing styles.
<CrazyHippie> aww
<otakon> his father?
<superretroworld> the springer show*
<otakon> yikes
<thelonepony> :'(
<Meanwhile> His father is deeeeeaaaaaad.
<Lunar_Brony> oni_link eeyup, and I'm gonna get it!
<Polydunami> You've integrated well, Zuxxez123 :3
<Zuxxez123> superretroworld: it's okay. :3 Everyone here will gladly give their two cents. :P
<[SWAG]Haku> wow

<superretroworld> Zuxxez123: :)
<[SWAG]Haku> "Oh no, my dad is dead! Wait, nevermind, he has some paper."
<otakon> crickets?
<oni_link> cricket!!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> otakon: Another reason why I love this game.
<Dark92Enigma-> DocSane: I get it......still awkward
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Busy: indeed
<Polydunami> Yeah, Hooktail is not too fond of cricket.
<oni_link> NO MERCY MARIO
<CrazyHippie> oh my god I had a dream about this
<otakon> Kolorado
<otakon> damn
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Lunar_Brony> Crystaline_Shard I prefer Thousand Year Door, but if you like Super Paper Mario more, that's cool too. I like it, but it ain't my favourite.
<oni_link> CrazyHippie: youre living up to your name, jk :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Poor Kolorado
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> otakon: IKR? :S
<Meanwhile> You fail at recognising the remains of your dad.
<Kimori> hi
<otakon> well at least it isn't his dead
<Lunar_Brony> true
<otakon> Meanwhile: would you recognize the bones of your dead dad?
<sub06905> dat dry bones
*Crystaline_Shard makes you feel the power of FORCED PERSPECTIVE
<Wirisme> Should we stop talking about Springer now?
<oni_link> [SWAG]Haku: that was Kolorado?? The explorer from the first one?? :o
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Meanwhile: *recognizing
<otakon> ZOMBIES!
<[SWAG]Haku> No, it was his dad
<Polydunami> Should have used a cricket bat against Hooktail :P
<oni_link> oh
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> LOVE this music here.
<CrazyHippie> oni_link: I was gonna get you for that. But I was too...far out
<otakon> KEEP HAMMERING!
<sub06905> NewSuperBronyU: trying to get every tattle? :3
<Meanwhile> otakon: Probably, the old git's missing his teeth and his jaw has serious scarring.
<oni_link> CrazyHippie: YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! :D
<CrazyHippie> ahaha
<Zuxxez123> Meanwhile: I know right? I mean COME ON! You should be able to recoginze the rotting remains of a loved one...
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'M GOING TO TATTLE THE FUCK OUT OF YOU
<Zombie_Brony> My people have returned for me! . . . wait, those are Dry Bones . . .
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome|Busy: No that's the yankee (wrong) way of doing it.
<Zombie_Brony> shit
<Polydunami> Right, I'll be back later. I'm out of here.
<Zombie_Brony> seeya pol-
<[SWAG]Haku> Cya Poly
<Wirisme> Bye again poly- oh he's gone
<Meanwhile> Zuxxez123: I have the right to say so, since I have.
<otakon> TAKE OUT THE DRY BONES FIRST NewSuperBronyU
<Zombie_Brony> I didn't get to say good-bye again
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Meanwhile: Yankee? Gee, that's a bit harsh.
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome|Busy: So's your face.
<otakon> welp they're dead
<sub06905> inb4 ded
<Zombie_Brony> otakon hwo about the Red Bones
<otakon> Zombie_Brony: that's who I meant

<Zombie_Brony> and Koops
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome|Busy: The power of intuition!

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> That and muffins.
<oni_link> I need to buy this game :0
*sub06905 believes NewSuperBronyU might die on the boss
<sub06905> :3
<CrazyHippie> Barbetos: That is one of my favorite tumblrs
<Lunar_Brony> I've got stuff to do, but I shouldn't be too long.
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: you seriously need to level up a bit I think man and USE ANOTHER POW BLOCK
<Lunar_Brony> I'll be back . . .

<oni_link> SB, MULTIBOUNCE!!!!!
<Zuxxez123> Return soon Lunar_Brony|AFK
<otakon> oni_link: it won't hit all of them at once
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02oni_link: They have a defense of 1, won't do anything :/
<Ryunosuke> I have a question
<oni_link> oh. i knew that o.o (not really)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Or wait...maybe it would...
<otakon> yeah bounce only does 1 damage
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: you gotta JUMP on him!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I think it does 2 damage ><
<Ryunosuke> is it me, or does the female outlander in T2 sound kinda like Raven? :)
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: still the point is you're kind of weak it seems
<sub06905> NewSuperBronyU: have you beat the 100 pit trials on other saved file?
<otakon> Ryunosuke: T2?
<CCCP> What game is play? Ii can't see stream :(
<Ryunosuke> torchlight 2
<CCCP> Playing*
*AdamTheDuck comes back a sees Mario.
<otakon> Ryunosuke: also that's Grey DeLisle so probably
<oni_link> CCCP: Paper Mario
*AdamTheDuck procedes to lick NewSuperBronyU :3
<Zuxxez123> CCCP: Paper Mario: 1000 year door.
*NewSuperBronyU is licked :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> NewSuperBronyU: Hammer does 2 in one attack. Jump does 1 for both 2 attacks.
<otakon> CCCP: Paper Mario the Thousand YEar Door
<Ryunosuke> ah
<CCCP> I love this game!
<Crystaline_Shard> you dunno where that pony been!
<otakon> I wish I had this game
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> NewSuperBronyU: My opinion: Go with the hammer.
<otakon> I LOVE the Paper Mario series
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<otakon> and the Superstar Saga series
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<oni_link> I thought multi bounce acted the same as in the first game where you bounce on enemy after enemy until you miss hitting the A button. o.o
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DEFINITELY.
<otakon> some of the BEST RPG's I've ever played
<Hammer> wat
<HatsuneMikuFan> They're botth great series
<otakon> they need to do a SuperStar HD release
<Hammer> Oh, mario
<oni_link> same here AJIsAwesome|Busy although Ive only played the first Superstar Saga
*Hammer can guess why he was pinged
<otakon> ESPECIALLY Bowser's Inside Story
<otakon> GREAT final boss music and fight
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> oni_link: You're fine with just playing the first one. Skip the second, recommend the third.
<superretroworld> otakon: how bout super mario rpg?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> otakon: You fight the secret boss yet?
<otakon> superretroworld: also great
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome|Busy: was the third one bowsers inside story?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> oni_link: Yep. :)
<sub06905> partners in time <3
<NENUDJUS> DeathStar: hey sup

<oni_link> AJIsAwesome|Busy: yea I need to play that one >.<
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I sold it long ago
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> otakon: WHAT? :O
<superretroworld> im pretty good at the mario rpgs and earthbound, but im terrible at the square soft rpgs
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I.WASN'T.GOOD.ENOUGH.TO.GET.TO.HIM.
<Zuxxez123> superretroworld: Why? Square Soft games are more or less grinder games.
*oni_link hasnt touched Super Mario RPG
<Meanwhile> Hehe, otakon sucks.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> otakon: Don't say that. You could've practiced. :(
<Zuxxez123> oni_link: Me neither, no worries.
<Crystaline_Shard> NewSuperBronyU: you missed a door
<otakon> superretroworld: you do realize SMRPG IS a Square game right?
<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: WELL im going now cya
<CrimsonPhoenix> superretroworld, am I ready to assume you played the superstar saga?
*oni_link sighs in relief

<Crystaline_Shard> you enter a hidden area
<superretroworld> otakon: ik, but its also a mario game and its pretty easy compare to ff and chrono trigger

<superretroworld> CrimsonPhoenix: ive played bowsers inside story, love that game
<otakon> superretroworld: true but CT and FF didn't have timed button presses. Or Geno
<DeathStar> darn it I just noticed he pinged me and he left ><
<otakon> Geno that MAGNIFICENT BASTARD
<[SWAG]Haku> HAKU MUST TAKE HIS LEAVE

*DeathStar dances on otakons head "what is this "no dancing" I don't think tht's propper grammer
<otakon> DeathStar: :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Press B at the right timing and you counter
<sub06905> ^
<oni_link> Cackletta was a great boss
<CrimsonPhoenix> the timing is tighter than the block though
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrimsonPhoenix: Pressing B instead allows you to completely negate damage and sometimes deal damage back.
<Meanwhile> DeathStar: Grammar*
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> WAIT
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrimsonPhoenix: Sorry.
<Zuxxez123> CrimsonPhoenix: as it should be. :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrimsonPhoenix: Meant for NewSuperBronyU.

<oni_link> we need bob-oms
<otakon> had 25 seconds to spare
<Calcos323> This would probably be my 13th playthrough if it were me. I adored this game back in the day
<sub06905> the bucking 100 pit trials man :|
<Crystaline_Shard> third playthrough and still missing secrets :/ you bring shame to all gamers :(
<oni_link> sub06905: in SPM?

<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: oh you
<Zuxxez123> Crystaline_Shard: I

<oni_link> sub06905: o,o
<Zuxxez123> Crystaline_Shard: I am not ashamed. Saddened, but not ashamed. :3
<CrazyHippie> seems legit
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: I dont blame you XD perfect moment
<sub06905> not much of a curse if you ask me
<Meanwhile> Fools, you have once again opened the box of unintentional helping.
<otakon> DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
<Calcos323> Happens another 2 times, too
<otakon> lol
<otakon> Meanwhile: lol
<CrazyHippie> Calcos323: Spoilers
<Dark_Horst> sooo... who can guess what this is referecning? http://derpiboo.ru/113048?scope=scpe6938c7b6f33c4941074d7e7a9211e11cccf895f3
<Calcos323> otakon! Haven't seen you in a while
<oni_link> I love nintendo curses. :D You will now hold double the magic bwahahaha, that is if thats okay :D
<Calcos323> CrazyHippie: Eh, not really. You figure out that this'll happen more times after the second one
<J_E_Smith71> The most cursed curse that ever did curse
<CrazyHippie> Calcos323: I wasnt serious...
<sub06905> love the yoshi sound fx badge <3
<oni_link> sub06905: :o do want
<Calcos323> CrazyHippie: Sorry. I take all text literally unless it's very clearly indicated sarcasm. One of my many faults
<Dark_Horst> memory card. you dont touch it
<Stallion_of_War> NewSuperBronyU: Uses his mallet like I use my crowbar in Hoof-Life 2
<Meanwhile> Never touch the memory card.
<Meanwhile> For it is sacred.
<CrazyHippie> Calcos323: No problem. It happened to me this afternoon while watching Doctor Who here
<Stallion_of_War> HIT ALL THE THINGS
<Zuxxez123> Calcos323: Naw, it's the internet, Sarcasm is hard to read. Lol. Unless followed by a :P or variation.
<CrazyHippie> ^
<Crystaline_Shard> Dark_Horst: only when mantis is reading it.
<Calcos323> Zuxxez123: Touche
<Stallion_of_War> I prefer </sarcasm>
<Calcos323> Still, we can all agree that I am crazy hype over this game right now
<CrazyHippie> did you say my name?
<Calcos323> One of the only Turn-Based RPGs I can enjoy
<Zuxxez123> Calcos323: Yes dear friend, you are hyped for this tremendous game. :D
<Crystaline_Shard> TBRPG is best RPG
<sub06905> as much as i loved 64, this one is the best paper mario
<Zuxxez123> (Tremendous game I have never played)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02^
<Calcos323> Hype is srs biz Zuxxez123
<Crystaline_Shard> sub06905: SPM is better :/
*sub06905 hasent played through SPM fully
<superretroworld> the 64 one was my favorite
<Meanwhile> I still question how a fat midget plumber on shrooms manages to save anything.
<Stallion_of_War> I touched the memory card once; it deleted the entire save. That was the day I realized that old saves are cast into
<Stallion_of_War> Oblivion before new ones are made
<Calcos323> Good catch on the Star Piece
<Zuxxez123> Meanwhile: happy conincidences.
<sub06905> i want to see how Sticker Star is going to turn out
<oni_link> whats with all the memory card talk? o.o
<Calcos323> Also, is it a rule that I'm not allowed to help NewSuperBronyU if he misses a secret?
<Stallion_of_War> I wanted to make a permenant savegame so I could replay a specific battle
<Meanwhile> I still have the memory cards from my PS2 somewhere.
<Crystaline_Shard> No rules like that.
<sub06905> dat rebuild
<Crystaline_Shard> he just ignores people when they try to help XD
<oni_link> oh
<sub06905> great now you have 3 to kill
<superretroworld> sub06905: it looks alright, but im dissapointed it wont be on a console
<Stallion_of_War> I still have GOD OF WAR 1 and 2 for ps2
<Zuxxez123> Meanwhile: I have 3 of them on my desk right now. Want one? :D
<Crystaline_Shard> sub06905: more EXP
<oni_link> Stallion_of_War: I used to do that all the time in Kingdom Hearts I and II
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I don't mind help, but I've played this game before ><
*Stallion_of_War </namesake>
<Barbetos> This game is more interesting when listening to the pillows.
<Meanwhile> Zuxxez123: Not unless they've got better completion than my Crash Bandicoot saves.
<Stallion_of_War> oni_link: KHII Sephiroth battle, Sephiroth battle over and over.
<oni_link> Stallion_of_War: OMG yes you read my mind
<Calcos323> NewSuperBronyU: Oh, I understand that, but even after 13-14 playthroughs, I'm STILL missing stuff
<sub06905> NewSuperBronyU: just no spoilers right? even though you have played through it
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02No spoilers for the sake of the chat :)
<Zuxxez123> Meanwhile: Alas, I don't have full completetion on the CB games on my cards, I'm ashamed...
<oni_link> thanks :P
<Stallion_of_War> I should get that again; I haven't played in at least 3 years
<Calcos323> Of course no story spoilers, I was just wondering about secrets
<Meanwhile> Spoilers, Bowser kidnaps the Princess.
<CrazyHippie> Spoilers* It's all a dream 6_9
<oni_link> Zuxxez123: CB?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If you want to point out secrets, go ahead :)
<Meanwhile> WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.
<Stallion_of_War> FFS SUPER MARIO 2
<Zuxxez123> oni_link: Crash Bandicoot.
<Zuxxez123> Meanwhile: Whadda tweest!
<oni_link> CrazyHippie: Just like Link's Awakening. :|
<oni_link> Zuxxez123: ohhhh
<Stallion_of_War> Defeat monsters, play as Peach - ALL MARIO'S DREAM
<Stallion_of_War> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Wow, I honestly didn't know you could press 'B' instead of 'A' to counter attacks o.o
<sub06905> i want to try to 100% this game
<Stallion_of_War> dge
<Zuxxez123> oni_link: it IS called Link's Awakening... :P
<CrazyHippie> does mhe ever weake up?
<CrazyHippie> wow that was terrible*
<HatsuneMikuFan> NewSuperBronyU: And this is your 3rd playthrough? lol
<Barbetos> owned
<oni_link> Zuxxez123: I thought it was symbolic, not literal.. this was back when i was a kid, mind you
<Calcos323> NewSuperBronyU: Yes you can! If you do that, you can actually reflect damage onto your attacker, but the timing is more strict
<Shammy> NewSuperBronyU....i must wub apon you for playing this..
*Shammy wubs apon NewSuperBronyU

<Dark_Horst> oni_link: ....that too
<ColeTheHedgehog> Yay machine gun text!
<Zuxxez123> I
<ColeTheHedgehog> Be right back

<Calcos323> NewSuperBronyU: You can get the Stylish during the first jump as well as the second
<Stallion_of_War> KOOPA DRAGR

<ColeTheHedgehog> Thanks
<oni_link> Dark_Horst: I had to say that because it was glaringly obvios that those horses were all impaled
<oni_link> :D
<CrazyHippie> Its been awhile ColeTheHedgehog
<ColeTheHedgehog> XD
<Calcos323> There you go
<ColeTheHedgehog> 20 seconds in pony years is 500 years.
<ColeTheHedgehog> Imagine 20 minutes in pony years.
<CrazyHippie> Imagine 1 day
<Calcos323> Nice trick shot
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nostalgia bomb http://derpy.me/0OHPF
<sub06905> dat stage haxard
<ColeTheHedgehog> Imaging 2012 years.
<Calcos323> fail
<sub06905> hazard*
<Zuxxez123> CrimsonPhoenix: That nostalgia hit...
<thelonepony> CrimsonPhoenix: i love that book when i was a kid
<Stallion_of_War> I rather liked Partners in Time and the one with the bean people, although eventually I got so good and overpowered I could defete Shroomqueen's first form in like, 4 moves
<Calcos323> That book...
<Stallion_of_War> max
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: I dont recall that book
<Stallion_of_War> multi clone jump
<Dark_Horst> and now one jsut for the d'aw of it http://derpiboo.ru/112663
<CrazyHippie> CrimsonPhoenix: The memories...
<CrimsonPhoenix> nostalgia bomb was a success sir
<Calcos323> BINGO
<Crystaline_Shard> Not for me.
<ColeTheHedgehog> I might be a bit slow to talk, I'm watching videos :3
<Crystaline_Shard> never read it,
<Dark_Horst> also this http://kp-shadowsquirrel.deviantart.com/art/Ready-for-the-Prom-329766494?q=gallery%3Akp-shadowsquirrel%2F15968270&qo=2
<Calcos323> NOW GIMMIE MAH 50 BUCKS
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's a secret for those bingos
<Dark_Horst> tell me when i'm getting spammy
<Stallion_of_War> http://larsurus.deviantart.com/art/Little-Derpy-with-tiara-PNG-261203406
<Barbetos> Replace one letter in that word with another letter in the alphabet and you will guess my name
<CrimsonPhoenix> you know
<cratorkid> CrimsonPhoenix: http://bit.ly/SVw94R
<Dark_Horst> Stallion_of_War: the best thing about that pic is that she probably mugged diamond tiara for that thing
<CrimsonPhoenix> this game is doable without upgrading your health
<Barbetos> Well assuming oyu get the right letter anyways
<Stallion_of_War> (\
<Meanwhile> Spooky ghost.
<oni_link> Stallion_of_War: best thing ever
<CrimsonPhoenix> I enjoyed watching Playthrough of BP run
<CrazyHippie> http://i.imgur.com/i5oJB.jpg

<ColeTheHedgehog> I like pie.
<Crystaline_Shard> you missed another thing
<oni_link> aw CrazyHippie left us with a very adorable pic
<CrimsonPhoenix> urgh Ponychan
<DoctoDoctorWho> Goodbye bronystate
<Calcos323> Don't forget the Sound FX badge! I did once, and it wasn't pretty
<Zuxxez123> Bye again DoctoDoctorWho
<DoctoDoctorWho> see yall tomorrow
<Calcos323> Bye DoctorDoctorWho!
<thelonepony> night DoctoDoctorWho
<CrimsonPhoenix> Calcos323, you can do it
<oni_link> night DoctoDoctorWho
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a challenge
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bye DoctoDoctorWho
<Crystaline_Shard> Night DoctoDoctorWho
<CrimsonPhoenix> a bit hard but I know you can do it
<Dark_Horst> i miss ponibooru. but i said that already
<Stallion_of_War> I need a picture of Discord complementing Loki on his horned helmate, preferably with Loki replaying that Ironman made fun of it.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, DoctoDoctorWho :)
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: You can, but it's unneeded challenge
<Stallion_of_War> Go up, room full of corpses; nothing strange here.
*Barbetos points furiously at the female goomba "It still lives NewSuperBronyU !!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> unneeded or not some people still enjoy it
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Barbetos: :P
<HatsuneMikuFan> I'm changing my bronystate name into my nickname
<CrimsonPhoenix> HatsuneMikuFan, bronystate name?
<Crystaline_Shard> her brony state user
<HatsuneMikuFan> Yeah, I'm changing it from HatsuneMikuFan into Slater
<Barbetos> HatsuneMikuFan has been an alias of an alias all along
<Barbetos> Its so DASTARDLY
<Calcos323> That's something I've never understood, CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> what a plot twist
<Crystaline_Shard> Barbetos: that was a horrible show
<Zuxxez123> HatsuneMikuFan: Jack Slater, perhaps? No... Probably not..
<HatsuneMikuFan> Nope
<CrimsonPhoenix> BP NewSuperBronyU
<CrimsonPhoenix> BP
<CrimsonPhoenix> always.....shit
<Barbetos> Crystaline_Shard Would you be surprised if I said I had never seen it?
<Slater> Bye HatsuneMikuFan and hello Slater
<Calcos323> I agree, BP is the way to go until around 18-21
<Calcos323> Then you can relax a bit
<CrimsonPhoenix> Calcos323, people invent challenges cause they want some spice in their gameplay
<CrimsonPhoenix> like nuzlock
<Stallion_of_War> It's nice how they just stand there and wait for you to kill them.
<CrimsonPhoenix> nuzlocke**
<oni_link> in the first one, didnt they punish raising the same stat, or was that Superstar Saga
<Calcos323> Then that's the point where they should move on to another game
<Zuxxez123> Stallion_of_War: it's a very polite battle of strength.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, only in superstar
<CrimsonPhoenix> Calcos323, what if they still enjoy that game
<Stallion_of_War> Reminds me of olde-tyme wars, with olde-tyme standing in lines getting shot.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's just another way to enjoy said game
<oni_link> ah thanks CrimsonPhoenix also, I do the nuzlocke challenge but in the original Red and Blue only
<Applechip> when did they make Mario turn based combat?
<Calcos323> CromsonPhoenix: If they still enjoy it, then why are they inventing artificial difficulty?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Applechip, a long time ago
<Crystaline_Shard> NewSuperBronyU: your badge
*Stallion_of_War I say good sir, would you very much mind standing in a line whilst my fellows shoot at yours?
<Calcos323> There's no point to if it's still fun
<CrimsonPhoenix> Calcos323, cause they feel like it
*Stallion_of_War Not at all my sir, not at all
<Calcos323> CromsonPhoenix: ...I don't get it
<Zuxxez123> Stallion_of_War: Those were the days, now they use cover and don't wear bright red everywhere the go. Pfft....
<Cranberry_Scotch> It started with Super Mario RPG for the Super Nintendo
<Calcos323> Cromson.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's like doing some recipe but changing some stuff
<Calcos323> Wow, I can't type
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a new way to play
<Calcos323> If you want something new, why not just switch games?
<Zuxxez123> Calcos323: Type Cri then hit tab, should auto type his name.
<Stallion_of_War> I tend to stand out in the open and shoot the crap out of everything.
*Crystaline_Shard drinks Cranberry_Scotch
<oni_link> Stallion_of_War: We are creatures of manners and courtesy. We wait our turn and take what is coming to us. And if you best us, then by all means my good chum, proceed. :D
<Cranberry_Scotch> ...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Calcos323, why do you need to switch games?
<Calcos323> Zuxxez123: That's awesome. I've been here for months and never knew that
<Zuxxez123> Stallion_of_War: The Rambo approach, a calculated risk, but very stylish.
<CrimsonPhoenix> you're making the argument go round
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a bit annoying
<Cranberry_Scotch> Crystaline_Shard: *Dies*
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: Because the one you're playing is clearly getting boring if you need to do that to keep enjoying it
*Crystaline_Shard flops over wasted.
<oni_link> I love that lucky sound effect ^.^
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also by doing that you save money
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: Sorry if it's getting repetitive, I'm just trying to understand
<CrimsonPhoenix> and you can still enjoy your game in a new way
<Stallion_of_War> don't touch the POWER button
*Stallion_of_War dat POWER
<oni_link> EVER
<otakon> CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAp
<Calcos323> Alright, I can see that, but there's 10,000,000 free games you can play online
<Crystaline_Shard> don't touch it HIT IT WITH A BASEBALLBAT!
<Calcos323> You have so many options
<oni_link> payper dragoon
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's also a sense of self-accomplishment
<Stallion_of_War> So THAT'S were the dragon flew off to after Fluttershy chased hiim away.
<otakon> lol
<otakon> what?
<otakon> TATTLE TIME!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Calcos323, you sound like those casual gamer actually
<Cranberry_Scotch> Actually, the dragon was chased out of this tower to Equestria
*Bronysith throws otakon at Cranberry_Scotch
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: Alright, I think I get it. I'd never do that myself, I find it a waste of time, but I understand. Thank you
*otakon dodges mid air
<otakon> crickets
<otakon> YOU DIDN'T GET THE CRICKET!
<oni_link> OH NO
<Bronysith> oh hey this the thousand years door?
<Cranberry_Scotch> IT'S TASTING TIME!
<otakon> crap not good
<oni_link> dragon is not amused
<otakon> GOTTA USE THE HAMMER!
<otakon> also USE dat koopa troopa!
<Crystaline_Shard> MOTHERFUGGIN STYLEISH LIKE A BOSS!
<Petrified_Discord> Dragon smack
<otakon> oh damn
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: I don't dislike challenge, man.
<otakon> ITEM!
<CrimsonPhoenix> NewSuperBronyU, you can counter those claws
<Zuxxez123> otakon: Something tells me you are REALLY into this...
<otakon> Zuxxez123: I am
<otakon> okay Koops can take another hit
<Stallion_of_War> MEAT SHIELD!
<oni_link> what does that mushroom in the top right mean?
<Crystaline_Shard> oni_link: porn
<otakon> oni_link: it's an item you can randomly get during the battle
<CrimsonPhoenix> Calcos323, you can also think of those "unneeded" challenges as personal acihevements
<Crystaline_Shard> STYLEISH LIKE ABAWS
<oni_link> oh
<CrimsonPhoenix> like those Achievements in Xbox360, PS3 and Steam
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: You already explained that, and I understand now. Self-fulfillment is good
<otakon> HAMMER TIME!
<oni_link> Crystaline_Shard: Is that why I couldnt stop looking at it?
<Crystaline_Shard> CrimsonPhoenix: steam achivments arin't pointless :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah just wanted to put up an example
<Petrified_Discord> Tactic: Beat it until it cries
<CrimsonPhoenix> Crystaline_Shard, I never said that but
<Barbetos> So his toe is dizzy?
<Bronysith> GNIGHT EVERYPONY
<CrimsonPhoenix> in a sense they are
<Barbetos> Okay.
<thelonepony> Night Bronysith
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, Bronysith :)
<Zuxxez123> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah, most achievements are crap, but when I'm playing a game I put a LOT of time in, and I get praised for it, I'll take it. :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> since they're COMPLETELY optional to enjoy a game
<Zuxxez123> Night Bronysith
<Barbetos> G'night Bronysith
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: However, as a person that's been playing and learning the same game for almost 4 years now, I can say that I don't think I'll ever do a Nuzlocke run anytime soon.
<Crystaline_Shard> CrimsonPhoenix: in TF2 you get shit for doing them and quite alot of other steam games
<Crystaline_Shard> STYLISH LIKE A BAWS
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: I just don't see the point
<CrimsonPhoenix> Crystaline_Shard, you can unlock those....without the achievment
<Petrified_Discord> Dat peril
<otakon> HEAL KOOPS!
<CrimsonPhoenix> remember in the good ol' days when games were still on cartridge
<Crystaline_Shard> CrimsonPhoenix: you can but achiment get is faster generally.
<otakon> FOR THE LOVE OF PONIES HEAL DAT KOOPS!
<CrimsonPhoenix> you never had achievment but you still had unlockables
<Crystaline_Shard> STYLE LIKE A BAWS!
<otakon> damn lucky
<otakon> IT'S A TRAP!
<Petrified_Discord> LIES
<otakon> LIES!
<Petrified_Discord> LIES AND DECIET
<otakon> LIES!
<oni_link> Achievements are pointless when they dont reward you but at the same time, they give you structure in your gameplay. You tend to play the game the way the devs intended rather than to just beat it as quick as possible
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<Crystaline_Shard> take the bribe :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Crystaline_Shard, remember Super Smash Brothers Melee and how there was ALOT of ways to unlock one character?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, DerpyMuffins :)
<DerpyMuffins> Woah Paper Mario?
<thelonepony> hi DerpyMuffins
<Calcos323> Hey DerpyMuffins!
<Slater> Hey DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> Number one or two?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Achievements rewards are pointless as well
<Zuxxez123> oni_link: Totally agreed, if it wasn't for some achievements, people would just stay on one path and never change course.
<Petrified_Discord> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> you can just simply do the thing and bam unlock, you don't needa label for it
<otakon> THE HELL?
<Crystaline_Shard> CrimsonPhoenix: NON BELIVER!
<otakon> did he just eat THE CROWD?!
<Meanwhile> I...think so.
<Slater> Eeyup
<otakon> woah
<otakon> I did NOT see that coming
<Stallion_of_War> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Stallion_of_War> KUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Me neither. :O
<otakon> HEAL Koopa!
<Calcos323> otakon: Yeah, the boss fights are nuts in this game
<otakon> HEAL HIM DAMMIT!
<otakon> oh crap not good
<Crystaline_Shard> STYLE...........LIKE A BAWS!
<cratorkid> Stallion_of_War: samuwri??
<DerpyMuffins> This is paper mario right?
<Calcos323> DO EET
<Slater> Yeah
<thelonepony> eeyup

<otakon> USE THE SPECIAL DAMMIT!
<Zuxxez123> Derpy_Hooves: 1000 year door.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Crystaline_Shard, you don't get it do you
<Stallion_of_War> Hakuouden?
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: seriously if you don't use that special you're gonna lose
<oni_link> Zuxxez123: I try to get some but not all because typically you cant get them all in the first run anyways. and also, If I end up beating a game, it adds to the replay value as well :)
<otakon> SHE'S TOO DAMN WEAK
<Zuxxez123> DerpyMuffins: 1000 year door.
<Crystaline_Shard> CrimsonPhoenix: NON BELIVER :D
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: you HAVE to use the Koopa
<CrimsonPhoenix> Crystaline_Shard, don't try my patience
<Stallion_of_War> Mario is winded
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: HEAL or the next attack will end you
<CrimsonPhoenix> let me figure it for you
<Silver_Spoon> <3 this game. Hi everypony!
<Crystaline_Shard> CrimsonPhoenix: I said NON BELIVER!
<otakon> hiya Silver_Spoon
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, Silver_Spoon :)

<Derpy_20pc> NewSuperBronyU: \:3/
<Cranberry_Scotch> Luigi makes a cameo in this game and is playable in Super paper Mario
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02oni_link: Np :)
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: No way, man. The fact that you can spam tremor like crazy late game is awesome
<Zuxxez123> It's a rock... A few things come to mind... MLP... And Road to El Dorado. :3
<Stallion_of_War> WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM HAMMER? I DEFEATED THIS GIANT DRAGON AND ALL I GET IS A ROCK???
*Maid_RainBow pokes the Memory card A
<Stallion_of_War> DUMB ROCK!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Stallion_of_War: :D
<Calcos323> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Meh, you can only use it so often. Tremor you can spam
<Petrified_Discord> Dem minions
<Meanwhile> ...Robotnik?
<DerpyMuffins> Mario-ception
<Calcos323> Meanwhile: That's what I thought when I first played this game lol
<DerpyMuffins> Eggman?
<Robotnik> Meanwhile: EEYYESSS?
<Meanwhile> Robotnik: Snoo PINGAS usual I see.
<Robotnik> Meanwhile: Exactly.
<Kurra> Hey all.
<thelonepony> hi Kurra
*Kurra is so completely dry for art tonight >_<
<Calcos323> NewSuperBronyU: Around what times will you be streaming this?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Kurra. :)
<Zuxxez123> Hello Kurra how's it going?
*Stallion_of_War We bring you to the latest installment: Counter Strike Mario, in which Mario finally buys Peach a gun and self-defence lessons SO HE CAN FINALLY DO SOME BUCKING PLUMBING
<Kurra> bluh.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Meanwhile: In alternate language dubs,Robotnik uses various traslations of penis
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Calcos323: Usually around now or, rarely, in the afternoon.
<Kurra> I'd play that o.o
<Meanwhile> Cranberry_Scotch: the more you know.
<DerpyMuffins> Peach has a voice actor now?
<Calcos323> NewSuperBronyU: Then I'll do my best to keep tabs. Thanks again for choosing this game. Means a lot to me
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Zuxxez123> I wish I had a connection to the game. :(
<Calcos323> Fighting Games are still the best
<Zuxxez123> If someone playing Symphony of the Night; I'd be ALL over that in a heartbeat. xD
<Stallion_of_War> It's nice when people talk in colours and hilight key information
<Petrified_Discord> Grodus duuuuuuude
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Same here. :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zuxxez123, WHAT IS A MOD?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Calcos323: Np, I love this game :D
<Calcos323> Zuxxez123: Am I the only person on the planet that prefers Super Castlevania 4 to SotN?
<Zuxxez123> CrimsonPhoenix: A miserble little pile of secerts perhaps?
<CrimsonPhoenix> A miserable little pile of ponies
<Stallion_of_War> I fought Sirens once, pounded their faces into the desert and ripped the top half of their heads off
<CrimsonPhoenix> but enough talk
<CrimsonPhoenix> have at you
<Kurra> Castlevania: HIT EVERYTHING
<Barbetos> So you add a lot of dialog to a mario game and everything becomes paper. Is that what this game is about?
<AJIsAwesome> Meh. Don't really like SC4, IMO.
<Zuxxez123> Calcos323: Naw, a lot of people like Super Castlevania 4. But I have a connection to SoTN personally.
<DerpyMuffins> Roselina?
<Calcos323> Zuxxez123: Gotcha
<Kurra> darnit, now I wana play Castlvania. Anyone know any online place to play?
<TheKatPony> hai guys im back
<Crystaline_Shard> X-Naughtzis?

*QuinnThePegaSistta nodds
<Dark92Enigma-> i wasn't on this show either, and i see why
<Lyra`> NewSuperBronyU, will you be my super special somepony for hearts and hooves day?
<DerpyMuffins> This show is too american
<Dark92Enigma-> I'm more of the Simpson's crowd
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03MERRIKA <3
<TheKatPony> is that a bad thing? o.o
<Barbetos> Hah
<Slater> ^
<Zuxxez123> DerpyMuffins: Ditto.
<TheKatPony> its big mac
<DerpyMuffins> Eeyup
<Zuxxez123> I can't relate to this people! I relate better with people from the future!
<Barbetos> I guess being from Texas I can appreciate this show.
<Barbetos> Or maybe I just like it
<DerpyMuffins> Wasnt Dale in an MLP episode?
<Barbetos> I dunno.
<Lyra`> NewSuperBronyU! why you deny my wub wub wub?
<TheKatPony> he was?????
<AJIsAwesome> Don't think he was. :S
<TheKatPony> awww, that would've been awesome
<dynamo2814> ok im writing a fanfiction where twilight gets stuck in our world my friend is wondering if i shoulkd make her human
<DerpyMuffins> I think it was in the buffilo episode
<AJIsAwesome> dynamo2814: Keep her a pony. :)
<DerpyMuffins> Keep her a pony
<Zuxxez123> DerpyMuffins: I'll do some research and find out for you. :D
<Lyra`> i read the lyra one where shes a human
<Lyra`> its fantastic :3
<Barbetos> Wow did that guy ask taht and then just leave?
<Meanwhile> The Hills have eyes.
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos: Guess he did.
<DerpyMuffins> lol Meanwhile
<TheKatPony> Yeah, keep her a pony. I'm not really a fan of the humanized ponies
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Barbetos> Lyra` Anthropology ?
<thelonepony> i'm back, what did i miss? :3
<Barbetos> That started my love for Lyra.
<Lyra`> i fight you TheKatPony
<Lyra`> and it was ;D
<AJIsAwesome> Never really could get into humanized ponies. It makes them generic, IMO.
<Lyra`> so good <3
<Lyra`> keeping the color scheem
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: What about humanized cosplayers like Tara?
<Lyra`> and they still think theyre ponies and act like ponies :3
<J_E_Smith71> ..or anyone for that matter
<TheKatPony> Yeah, it just doesn't sit right with me :/
<otakon> buffer
<otakon> damn you buffer
<Zuxxez123> J_E_Smith71: I think that is different. I mean, changing the characters to humans is nothing like cosplaying as the character.
<TheKatPony> or like when the give RD wings even as a human? o.e
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Cosplaying characters such as ponies are fine, but not when the characters themselves are humanized.
<DerpyMuffins> I kinda find it a turn off when I see Twilight's horn in human form
<TheKatPony> ^^
<Buytoast> because it's wrong
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: I can totally agree with that. Humanizing the characters themselves just is off in my opinion. But seeing a fan dress like their favorite character is totally fine.
<Lyra`> she doesnt need a horn ;3
<AJIsAwesome> The fact that they were designed that way from the very beginning makes them unique, and to see them turned into something different kills it for me.
<Lyra`> once.
<J_E_Smith71> Ouch
<DerpyMuffins> She cheated with the Indian right?
<otakon> yikes
<TheKatPony> If you're gonna make them human, don't give them horns or wings :/
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: So, do you not like when other characters are ponified?
<otakon> and Hank is clueless
<Barbetos> Huh.
<TheKatPony> That just makes them look worse.
<Barbetos> Clueless Hank is best Hank.
<Lyra`> oh yeah, you too :3
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Not really. Some I do, but most of them not because of their given design.
<DerpyMuffins> Asians always make americans look bad
<LunasGuard|Tired> ello everpony back from school
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Lunar_Brony|AFK :)
<Barbetos> Hm. I wonder how you guys would feel about a humanized rarity that is not white.
<AJIsAwesome> *LunasGuard|Tired:
<Barbetos> Or any pony not white when going human
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: It's hard to make a good ponified character.
<thelonepony> hi LunasGuard|Tired
<TheKatPony> hey LunasGuard
<DerpyMuffins> Your missing a ' LunasGuard
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Agreed. The design must be very similar to the person/thing in reality.
<Slater> Hi LunasGuard|Tired
<Lyra`> this show makes me feel stupid
<Lyra`> like an american.
<DerpyMuffins> Glad Im not
<LunasGuard|Tired> ello AJIsAwesome thelonepony Slater

<Meanwhile> Lyra`: Just means it's working.

<doctor_whooves127> poor bill
<Lyra`> thats the saddest thing ive ever seen.
<J_E_Smith71> Heh Bill microwaving a frozen turkey dinner
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: I wouldn't mind that, as long as each one has something different from each other. :)
<DerpyMuffins> Bill is kinda like Spike in a loser kind of way
<LunasGuard|Tired> never though this will be here
<J_E_Smith71> C'mon Bill you could have least gone to Cracker Barrell. At least they're open Thanksgiving

<Gunthler> Lyra` :P
*Shizuka 13pounces LadyCanary
<Lunar_Brony> hi Shizuka
<LadyCanary> Shizu!!!!
<VenHur> I like Sticker Star so far, It going back to the turn by turn fomula we seen in the first two installments, instead of the platforming we seen in Super Paper Mario.

<LadyCanary> Lunar_Brony: So what's up? :o
<Rustymeat> Well what can a toad do?
<Buytoast> yeah, not like Super Mario Bros. 2 had you play as Toad or anything
<LunasGuard|Tired> no one likes toad

<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: DOn't bother.
<Zuxxez123> The first brony? Would that consist of G1 fans?
<Slater> I'm joining after this game

<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: True.
<donutpop365> Oh hi, Kammerjunk.
<Kammerjunk> VenHur: Well, that's not a very good basis for hate. It's really not the whole "wr r legiun lol", it's just mostly bad.

<AJIsAwesome> Yes, it is.
<AdamTheDuck> o.o Damn, playing the song by ear?
<VenHur> Tha first part?
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: im bored what should i do?
<VenHur> SPOT ON!
*Shizuka 13has good ears
*Polydunami has perfect pitch :$
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: You have it too? :O
*weeping_pegasi82 plays cello
<VenHur> Dat pitch
<AdamTheDuck> NENUDJUS, watch music get played by ear like what Shizu is doing right now? :3
<Vordox> What is a pitch?
*AJIsAwesome also has perfect pitch :$
<Vordox> Selling producets?
<Polydunami> Wait, I'm not alone in this world?
<Kurra> :( I wish I was good at things like this. v_v I'm just getting old
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: /)
<Polydunami> /) AJIsAwesome
<Kurra> how do you know if you have perfect pitch?
<Ryunosuke> inb4 space is 20% cooler
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: im to laggy i can only get chat atm
<Shizuka> 13^-^
<AdamTheDuck> Ryunosuke, lol ikr XD
<Shizuka> 13stick that in your hat :3
*Vordox is waiting for Shizuka to do Night of Pony. XD
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: :D
<VenHur> Looks excellent so far.
<Kurra> Shizuka, that would fave taken me three hours to do that. How you do it in one minute??? D8
*Spectrum_Rush does not have perfect pitch, but does not care because f u
<weeping_pegasi82> magic
<AdamTheDuck> NENUDJUS, hmm, that's a pity. Let me think... :P
<Shizuka> 13unfortunately i can't squeeze the shorter notes in
*weeping_pegasi82 has to have good ears to tune instrument
<Polydunami> Well, if you can tell what key a song is in by ear, Kurra, then you have perfect pitch.
<Kurra> oh.
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: ask me anything
<Polydunami> Can you adjust the tempo at all, Shizuka?
<AJIsAwesome> Kurra: Perfect pitch (also referred to as absolute pitch) is an ability to instantaneously identify or sing any given musical note without a reference pitch. There are two types of perfect pitch: active and passive. A person with active perfect pitch is able to sing or hum any given pitch; that is, if they are asked to sing a B flat without hearing the said note or any reference note, they can, whereas a person with passive perfect pitch cannot.
<Kurra> what's a key? :s
<AdamTheDuck> NENUDJUS, why is Spike best pony?
<Shizuka> 13yeah but it starts throwing things off
<AJIsAwesome> DAT TEXT WALL. :$
<Shizuka> 13pretty sure i can't do triplets
<Polydunami> Oh. Dang
<Polydunami> Well, that's kind of lame :(
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: well because he is not a pony
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: What is?
<AdamTheDuck> NENUDJUS, :|
<twilight_sprinkle1> oh, thats what perfect pitch is? then i have it too
<NENUDJUS> :P
<adasdad> dahr derp doop!
*weeping_pegasi82 does not have perfect pitch...
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle1: /)
<twilight_sprinkle1> AJIsAwesome: (\
<Polydunami> Oh wow, so that is three people here so far
<twilight_sprinkle1> perfect pitch isnt that rare though
<AJIsAwesome> But it's not common, either though.
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: keep up the questions ill do my best to reply with my awesome brain!
<Polydunami> You kidding? I'm the only one I know who has perfect pitch
*Spectrum_Rush inb4 ya'll are just liein' :P
*Kurra has something sorta vaguely like perfect pitch.... but... not perfect
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: Actually, I'm not. :S
<twilight_sprinkle1> i knew a lot of people with perfect pitch..then again, i was in music school
<Polydunami> I'm not that creative.
<AJIsAwesome> Kurra: You mean relative pitch?
<twilight_sprinkle1> and in choirce
<twilight_sprinkle1> *choire
<AJIsAwesome> *choir? :P
<twilight_sprinkle1> yeah, that :P
<AdamTheDuck> NENUDJUS, stream is too distracting XD

<VenHur> Nope, it's actually a different game called SimTunes.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Polydunami> Okay, this is getting slightly immature :P
<XylemTube> It's an accapella simulator!
<AJIsAwesome> What do you mean?
<VenHur> You know, by the same guys who doned The Sims, Spore, SimCity, all those stuff.
<Buytoast> ah spore
<Buytoast> what a steaming pile of disspaointmnet
<XylemTube> Spore seemed like such a good game before it came out
<Kurra> Ah remember when people paid cold hard bits just to make creatures that they couldn't even play with online.
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: im a pillar of knowledge ask me anything
<VenHur> I liked Spore...but yeah, it can gets boring after the Cell stage...
<AdamTheDuck> NENUDJUS, what comes into play in a bullet's trajectory when fired at extremely long distances? .-.
<Kurra> \/\/\/\/\/\/
<twilight_sprinkle1> ^^^^^^

<AJIsAwesome> (V)O,,,,O(V)
<twilight_sprinkle1> ew toes
<Cades> Going to bed, night
<Kurra> toes are awesome |3
<twilight_sprinkle1> feet are gross, they should be cut off and replaced with paws or hooves
<Queen_Chrysalis> o3o
<AdamTheDuck> But what about hands? :<
<Kurra> no they're not D: feet are as cool as hooves or fins or tails.
<twilight_sprinkle1> hands are ok
<Buytoast> feet are wonderful
<Kurra> hands RAWK, they make great swiss army tools cx
<Kurra> PAWS RAWK o///o
<VenHur> I like my feets, thanks you very much...
<Silver_Spoon> hooves > feet
<twilight_sprinkle1> paws>=hooves>feet
<AJIsAwesome> Feet>hooves, IMO.
<AJIsAwesome> I prefer feet.
<twilight_sprinkle1> youre all sick!
<Silver_Spoon> can't stub your hoof
<Kurra> okay feet: uuuuU Uuuuu and paws: vVVv vVVv and hooves are uh... ( ) ( )
<Polydunami> Yeah, it's basically one big nail.
<Polydunami> Rather, fingernail
<Kurra> you can crack your hoof.
<Silver_Spoon> and now I might not like hooves so much >_<
<Kurra> oh relax.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I got mah mail-in voter card thingy in the mail today O3O
<Zuxxez123> What about getting Horse shows nailed into your hooves for comforts sake?
<Zuxxez123> NewSuperBronyU: Aren't you fancy?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yesh ^-^
<Zuxxez123> shoes*
<Kurra> every kind of extremity has its vulnerabilities, so just enjoy feet or hooves for what they are, fun and nice to massage and great tools.

<Chrysalis> aww that would of been awesome to leave it unlit
<Shizuka> 13which also doesn't have a proper ending
<Chrysalis> except by the energy pulses
<Shizuka> 13i believe the DVD lets you isolate instruments, but not sure
<Polydunami> Oh?
<Shizuka> 13they would have made zillions if this were an interactive program
<Polydunami> Oh, absolutely
<Shizuka> 13i remember hearing that at the least the songs would come with alternate camera tracks
<ASoftFluffyThing> The render times for these must have been FUCKING INSANE
<Shizuka> 13so if you can't isolate an instrument you can at least focus on it without the camera moving around
<Chrysalis> ASoftFluffyThing why?
<Chrysalis> could run this realtime
<VenHur> Shizuka: Oh, deffinetly, I would go nuts to use songs with only the bass lines!
<Scottish-geeky> DeathStar: allo
<Shizuka> 13this echo is brilliant
<Chrysalis> VenHur why, a song without a meolody is just boring
<Pinkies4thWall> This is why i bought Bose headphones
<DeathStar> Scottish-geeky: hello
<Chrysalis> Pinkies4thWall this is why i bought bose desktop speakers :P
<Polydunami> The drums just reminded me of In the Air Tonight :S

<Spell-of-Gaming> killerpony7733: How did it turn out?
<AdamTheDuck> Why am I suddenly deaf in my right ear?
<killerpony7733> Spell-of-Gaming Well i don't know yet obviously but considering i ran all the things the microsoft word said was not right and had no indications afterwards i'd say very well. But alas i'll see

*StupidSexyCJ coughs
<killerpony7733> ded chat is deeed
<StupidSexyCJ> was it something I said?
<killerpony7733> Nope
<StupidSexyCJ> this has to be a new record of silence
<killerpony7733> Nah
*Spell-of-Gaming is currently painting.
<killerpony7733> I think it's been worse
<StupidSexyCJ> whatcha paintin' Spell-of-Gaming
<Spell-of-Gaming> Flowers.
<Spell-of-Gaming> For my art class.
<StupidSexyCJ> the pretty kind?
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...Not exactly.
<StupidSexyCJ> the man-eating kind?
<thegt90> here i will no loger make a silence in ur home https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykmNPeRScDM u might want to turn down ur speakers if there up high
<Spell-of-Gaming> The ugly kind, actually.
<StupidSexyCJ> ugly flowers? blasphemy!
<Spell-of-Gaming> I wish I used poster color, though. I'm using watercolor right now.
<Spectrum_Rush> the silentest the chat has ever been in recent times is about 30 minutes between posts, It happen one time when Wrek had an emergency and for got to end stream
<StupidSexyCJ> dayum
<Spell-of-Gaming> Poster color > Watercolor
<StupidSexyCJ> charcoal > everything
<Spell-of-Gaming> Are you implying that I should paint with charcoal?
<StupidSexyCJ> but yeah, i hate water color too
<StupidSexyCJ> yes, you will be a pioneer in art!
<Spell-of-Gaming> There was an option that we could use either oil pastels, watercolor or poster color.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Unfortunately, I'm not really good with oil pastels and I don't have any poster color. FML
<StupidSexyCJ> painting with pastels sounds difficult
<Spell-of-Gaming> You have to avoid spaces to make it perfect.
<StupidSexyCJ> i think they staart to smell a bit burny if you use a lot if i remember correctly too
<StupidSexyCJ> traditional media is all hard i guess, digital is best for me
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm starting to think if the world's greatest artists hate water color too.
<StupidSexyCJ> i dont know of many artists in general that use it
<StupidSexyCJ> save for one western manga artist whose name i cant remember
<StupidSexyCJ> so do you do much painting outside of class?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Not really, but I am interested in the history of painting.
<StupidSexyCJ> oh cool
<alexxm> hey guys
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai alexxm
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai alexxm :3

<alexxm> oh no luck then?
<pinkiespice> i went out of the interview as quikly as i went in
<pinkiespice> quickly*
<StupidSexyCJ> its like speed-dating, but with added stress!
<pinkiespice> Apperntly they still have had a record of my first aplpcation and my first interview from a few years ago
<pinkiespice> so they decided not to even bother with me
<Vivix> Ooh..
<StupidSexyCJ> ouch
<pinkiespice> And i was preparing for it since sunday
<pinkiespice> when i found out they were desprately looking for emploies
<pinkiespice> I mostly felt like i walked into a creampie to the face and hulimated myself
<alexxm> sorry to hear that
<AdamTheDuck> someone needs an internet-hug
*AdamTheDuck hugs pinkiespice :/
<StupidSexyCJ> so sucky day huh?
<Spell-of-Gaming> OMG
<pinkiespice> sleeping over it made me feel better though
<Spell-of-Gaming> MORE SLOTS FOR EMOTICONS IN ANIMAL CROSSING 3DS
<Spell-of-Gaming> YEAHHHHHHH
<AdamTheDuck> Dat nerdgasm :3
<pinkiespice> I don't know wether to show up my face in the local chain anymore
<Vivix> I'm terrified of interviews-
<Spell-of-Gaming> Enjoying the Nintendo Direct so far.
<StupidSexyCJ> I don't think i'm crazy for ing this, but i think maybe, possibly. Spell-of-Gaming likes nintendo slightly
<pinkiespice> since apperntly they recongized my facce from back then.
<Vivix> hehe
<StupidSexyCJ> pinkiespice: never lose hope
<Vivix> Yeah, that's important
<pinkiespice> it was one of my favorite chains too >_<
<Spell-of-Gaming> I love Nintendo. :P But I'm not one of those fanboys who praise every game in every Nintendo console.
<StupidSexyCJ> As far as Nintendo goes, im a Zelda nut
<StupidSexyCJ> but thats about it, well i like mario too, but not nearly aas much
<Vivix> I grew up without nintendo- so the only game I remember is from playing with friends, so that's goldeneye
<Vivix> have tried zelda and mario, of course, mother is a huuuge mario nerd, but I'm not really
<StupidSexyCJ> goldeneye was awesome, but it didnt age very well
<Vivix> yeaa
<Vivix> the rom download was 5 mb <,<
<alexxm> i grew up with the first pokemon that was actually the first game i owned
<StupidSexyCJ> Vivix: mario rom?
<Vivix> Aah, I was never that into pokemon, but I really like the way that they Loook (feral nerd) but- I think I might get into some of the games, maybe
<Vivix> eh goldeneye rom
<Ponies47> I idled all night on TF2. The stuff I got. Is mostly stuff I already have :<
<Vivix> O.o
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning Ponies47 :P
<AdamTheDuck> Happy I didn't ping you?
<StupidSexyCJ> I love pokemon, i got tired of it after like gen 3 though
<AdamTheDuck> Which one was gen 3?
<Vivix> I only remember gen 1, but I've seen a lot of the others online
<AdamTheDuck> I just stopped at Saphire and Ruby
<Ponies47> I've been here AdamTheDuck. And actually I had headphones connected to my computer so I didn't hear anything. And if anyone did ping me last night I didn't hear it. I just wanted to waste there time! :P
<StupidSexyCJ> g3 was Emerald i think
<alexxm> AdamTheDuck ruby and saphire
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah, it got boring after Emerald...
<Vivix> I was reading on the pokemon wiki, for some reason,
<Vivix> apparently ..mew is the only pokemon who does not lay eggs, but gives birth
<AdamTheDuck> .-.
<Vivix> I think it was Mew
<StupidSexyCJ> it was just too repetitive to do the same thing a third time, then a fourth
<alexxm> thats odd
<Vivix> it said it was because mew predated the egg thing info from some game, but they kept it in the later games- so it became canon I guess
<StupidSexyCJ> I hear that Ditto is a genetic reject clone of Mew
<Vivix> Hehehe
<alexxm> so mews basically god then
<Vivix> Hm
<StupidSexyCJ> which makes mewtwo a reject ditto
<alexxm> where did it say ditto was a reject mew
<StupidSexyCJ> i dont think its canon, but like theory
<alexxm> ah like garys ratticate dying
<ofna01> Ded chat?
<StupidSexyCJ> since the ditto are all around mewtwo, and mew can use transform. it is theorized that dittos are failed attempts to clone mew same as mewtwo
<JRP2234> Phase4 i dident know you ported the derpy.me add on to chrome
<Vivix> Maybe it wasn't Mew, trying to find the text now
<Vivix> Ooh, I love things like that CJ

<StupidSexyCJ> lol AdamTheDuck
<Vivix> "he Pokémon Mansion journals (which predate Generation II's introduction of breeding) describe Mew giving birth as opposed to laying an Egg. These were not retconned in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen."
<Spell-of-Gaming> Are you gonna stream, Phase4? :P
<StupidSexyCJ> i wonder if people lay eggs, or perhaps evolved from mew
<JRP2234> Phase4 commodore 64

<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpEXBM39xr4&feature=g-all-f This is amazing
<Barbetos> Been a while since I have listend to Haymaker
<Barbetos> I love it when they have media fire links =)
<Barbetos> And arrested development
<Barbetos> It is coming back
<Barbetos> Now if they also did Firefly
<Barbetos> Pony fandom would be in trouble to put it lightly
<AdamTheDuck> well if you can't recognize perfection
<AdamTheDuck> I can't accept your rejection
<AdamTheDuck> I love wonderful lyrics \:3/

<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, what do you meen no
<Barbetos> I played Pony Kart :3
<Barbetos> The AI on pinkie pie and Aj are a little wonky
<Ponies47> I saw people playing Fighting is Magic at Canterlot Gardens. But the line to play it was so looooooooooooooooooooong. So I passed
<Barbetos> It will come out in due time
<Ponies47> I atleast watched people play it. I looks pretty awesome I'm pretty sure I'll be getting the game when it's comeplete
<Barbetos> tiem for something different http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPXGELbDmqA
<Phase4> 00,02Barbetos, ponykart was open source last time i looked
<Ponies47> complete*
<Barbetos> Phase4 o really?
<Ponies47> *It
<Barbetos> Well any jack ass could of had that set up
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, i even looked through the sources
<Barbetos> I still played it though
<Dark92Enigma-> Ponies47: it must've been a long line, but i would still be in it
<Ryunosuke> o/
<Dark92Enigma-> btw i'm back
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back Dark92Enigma-
<Barbetos> wb Dark92Enigma-
<Dark92Enigma-> Oh wait, gotta change my nick
<Barbetos> is it gona hurt?
<Dark92Enigma> there we go
<Dark92Enigma> nope. it didn't
<Barbetos> I need to find and download that Uma Floresta song
<Barbetos> Its needs to be a pmv
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma-: It was to long for me. I also passed on getting autographs. I wasen't going to wait in line for 5 hours just to get Tara Strongs autograph. Plus you had to PAY to get autographs.
<Phase4> 00,02Barbetos, yeah, here it is http://sourceforge.net/p/ponykart/code/
<Barbetos> Huh
<Barbetos> Well I dunno what to think now
<Barbetos> Well Brony Fan fair made a big deal out of it
<Barbetos> sorta
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: pay for them?? were them really 5 HOURS¡?
<Phase4> 00,02Barbetos, i assume some of the art assets are closed still but that does run
<Ponies47> Whoops. Closed Bstate by accident
<Phase4> 00,02infact i was impressed, the apple achers map was a little unoptimized and had 600k polygons
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: Yes they were making you PAY for them. I wasen't going to do that they wanted $20 just to get a picture with them -_-
<Phase4> 00,02and it ran 60fps including all the shaders
<Phase4> 00,02that was on my old laptop with its shoddy gpu
<Dark92Enigma> Corporative bastards...........
<Dark92Enigma> If i ever get an autograph, i hope i don't have to pay
<Dark92Enigma> brb breakfast time for me
<Barbetos> That is pretty good actually
<Barbetos> The engine was written to?
<Barbetos> That alone is pretty impressive
<Barbetos> Most people seem to just use UDK or something
<Ponies47> I left my cats outside last night :S
<Barbetos> Its too late. Check your everything.
<Barbetos> There might be.. surprises
<Ponies47> Nah there fine
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :)
<AdamTheDuck> Time fore something soothing and different, my favouite song on the album: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKpBorhMLhI
<Ponies47> Sup Sylandest!
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Sylandest
<Sylandest> howdy Ponies47, AdamTheDuck :)
*Ponies47 Goes back to working on art
<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: no stream atm, i take it?
<AdamTheDuck> Sylandest, nope, tis why I linked a song :P
<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: good thinking! I'm still coming to consciousness, lol. Woke up about 10 minutes ago
<Ponies47> Ok here's a question that's pretty much impossible answer. If you had the choice to A. Be a pony but still live here in this world or B. Live in Equestria but you would still have to be a human. Which would you choose and why?
<AdamTheDuck> Sylandest, check out the song, it's a fine way to start a morning :3
<AdamTheDuck> Equestria
<Ponies47> It's ok if you need forever to decide
<AdamTheDuck> ^ nope :P
<Sylandest> Ponies47: go to Equestria. Done.
<Ponies47> Sylandest: Yeah but you have to stay in your human form. If was there as a human I would feel outta place.
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, I'd assume they may make one welcome.
<Barbetos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcCCb3MgpKw amv
<Sylandest> Ponies47: I feel I would be able to adapt well enough. It would be tricky at first, but I could make it work
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: I would just feel outta place.
<Ponies47> Sylandest: I would rather be a pony insted but also live in Equestria.
<Sylandest> Ponies47: but you didnt give us that option :P
<Ponies47> Sylandest: Yeah. So it would take me FOREVER to decide :P
<Ponies47> Well I gotta go now.
<Ponies47> Seeya guys
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47~
<Sylandest> laters, Ponies47
<Ponies47> I think i'm gonna idle on TF2 while I'm at school

<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Ninjazz
<BoroBrony> wake up peeps
<LightTrooper105> hallo Ninjazz
<BoroBrony> hello ninjazz
<AdamTheDuck> Looking through my video search history is fun :3
<Sylandest> howdy again, Ninjazz!
<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: mine's filled with epic music :D
<JRP2234> ughh
<AdamTheDuck> Sylandest, epic you say? :3
<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: indeedily I do

<AdamTheDuck> Well this has an epic intro~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Jfctt1b8o
<JRP2234> hi
<AdamTheDuck> And for some reason I affiliate it with a steampunk imagery .-.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai JRP2234
<BoroBrony> hello JRP2234 and what a tune :) :)
<BoroBrony> yes i agree
<BoroBrony> awkward silence agian
<Vivix> baacksiies
<AdamTheDuck> ohai again Vivix
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Ryunosuke> ponyholics anonymous
<Vivix> Hiya AdamTheDuck
<Vivix> I like the first link
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, which one?
<BoroBrony> hi Vivix
<Vivix> Pinkie pie propoganda
<Vordox> Phase4: :'(
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, ?
<AdamTheDuck> I know, seemed appropriate as it had the "Welcome" song in it to welcome our new guest, BoroBrony :P
<Vivix> Hehe yeah
<Phase4> 00,02my my, lots of new ponies these days
<Vordox> Phase4: Having 3 languages at same time...
*Phase4 00,02hugs BoroBrony
<Vordox> Not good for computer
<Vivix> I don't listen enough to brony music, despite making brony music, but I'm not big on electronica or that big on orchestral, so it often slips my mind
<Vordox> Phase4: The delay is still from AS3 though
<Vordox> So....
<Vordox> What now?
<BoroBrony> it was a nive welcome it good to be here with people who like MLP
<Ryunosuke> o/ Phase4
<BoroBrony> dam laptop meant nice
<Vordox> Feeling like "Scrap" is the only true way now... But how to make the game? :(
<Vivix> What's going on?
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, actionscript was never that good for real time, your only issue with pure javascript is the animations and i'm not sure how to do those
<AdamTheDuck> I hope this guy does more chiptune/classical songs, I've already listed to most of them... :/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR9xLhC2nM
<Vivix> you trying to use javascript and..canvas?
<AdamTheDuck> Lets see what other amazing works I can scavenge from my youtube history~
<Barbetos> Use FiM++ its the obvious choice
<Vivix> interesting mix
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> I find canvas to be--good, but--
<Vivix> chrome is slow, firefox has bugs, ie9 works fine-chrome and ie9 I think draws aliasing a bit odd
<Barbetos> Chrome tends to feel like it considers if you really want to see that page you just put in the address bar sometimes
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, I simply chose Chrome for the customisation :P
<Barbetos> Oh and it likes to crash flash sometimes
<Ninjazz> Chrome loves crashing Shockwave.
<Vivix> I like using chrome, but I'm making a html5 drawing room thing, and--it draws canvases MUCH slower than any other browser i try
<Vivix> and I can't figure out why
<Ninjazz> It's amazing. -_-
<XAX> night gents
<Phase4> 00,02chrome is built around ipc, each tab is a new copy of chrome, which would be ok but it really is built around ipc and the ipc channels are not so fast
<Ninjazz> Nacht XAX. :3
<Phase4> 00,02night XAX
<Vivix> Nightie
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight XAX
<prince-dari> Huh
<prince-dari> Google and youtube won't load for me
<BoroBrony> night night
<prince-dari> But everything else will
<XAX> :o
<Vivix> is there any way to make chrome react faster in canvas? I mean even drawing, it has fewer points per second than the other browser, making lines a bit choppier-
<Barbetos> prince-dari must be chrome
<Barbetos> Night XAX
<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, loads fine here
<AdamTheDuck> Mentlegen, I welcome everyone to 'insanity' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jKuYOotsA
<BoroBrony> yeah chrome is pretty awesome
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, you can draw in an offscreen canvas and then copy accross
<Ninjazz> prince-dari, Google found out your search history and doesn't want your service.
<prince-dari> XD
<Phase4> 00,02that might be faster, not sure
<prince-dari> I can ping them both
<Ninjazz> Huh. That's odd then.
<Vivix> hm- maybe- it's instant and fast in other browser as it is now, using 4 canvases <,<
<prince-dari> I'm using google's DNS servers so maybe they've derped something
<rdash> prince-dari: as in the 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4?
<prince-dari> Yeah
<rdash> gotta love that ip range xD
<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, they're up from here
<rdash> so easy to remember lol
<Phase4> 00,02i've never actually seen google offline
<rdash> prince-dari: one sec and ill get you my dns ip...
<rdash> its wicked fast lol
<Phase4> 00,02if it doesn't work i assume my connection is busted
<prince-dari> Nah, I'll just /flushdns
<BoroBrony> yeah got to be connection problems
<prince-dari> Will probably fix
<prince-dari> Yep
<prince-dari> Fixed
<Phase4> 00,02windows dns y u randomly derp
<prince-dari> wandows
<prince-dari> r u drunk
<rdash> prince-dari: if it derps again, 75.75.76.76 and 75.75.75.75.
<Phase4> 00,02pdnsd is best dns cache
<BoroBrony> its always drunk
<Vivix> windows:....no *wine stained shirt*
<BoroBrony> i found my window lieing in a pit of beer cans
<Phase4> 00,02i'm nut dornk offisher
<Ninjazz> Too much technical talk. 6_9
<BoroBrony> :)
<BoroBrony> try being where i work
<BoroBrony> i do art for ubisoft in newcastle and all i here is technical talk lol :)
<Vivix> hehe
<Ninjazz> hear*
<Vivix> I am a noob to most things technical, giving up computers for music when I was a teen
<Vivix> but- javascript is fun to learn, and I want a new paintchat
<prince-dari> >more recommended videos
<Vivix> cause they're slowly vanishing
<prince-dari> >My Little Pony the Mvoei - Full Movie!
<prince-dari> Lulno
<Vivix> hehe
<Ninjazz> Wut.
<Ninjazz> OH.
<Vivix> Is good moovi, promise
<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, G1 movie is fun
<prince-dari> Also recommended is 'eating giant slug'
<prince-dari> That I will watch
<Ninjazz> For some freakin' reason, I got the Barbie movie in my recommended videos this morning.
<Phase4> 00,02was there a G2 movie or just tv
<Ninjazz> I wonder why. >_>
<prince-dari> Oh, it's Food For Louis, of course
<BoroBrony> i might go play some halo later
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh, such magnificence. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EezZ0w7J7fg \:3/
<AdamTheDuck> It's a shame all my favourite uploaders have sort of stopped puting up new music... :/
<Vivix> Aww
<Vivix> my favourites are probably...mainly just pinkiepieswears
<Vivix> but I like some people on EQbeats, eh everfreeluna? I suck at names
<Ninjazz> Sim Gretina is my current favorite.
<Ninjazz> But I've started to like General Mumble.
<Vivix> EverfreeLuna and Meletric
<Barbetos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQXQrPdwego BoroBrony
<Phase4> 00,02i accidentally hit the subscribe button for yogscast while watching one of their vids, now i've got nothing but minecraft in my recomended videos
<Ninjazz> Phase4, they were better a few months ago.
<Vivix> I feel like such ah ipster sometimes, I've never heard any of the really popular ones
<Ninjazz> Back when Shadow of Israphael.
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh I youtube for doing that Phase4 >.>
<AdamTheDuck> I hate*
<Lil_B> Hi everyone :)
<Vivix> I don't really like SoI anymore, it was better when it was just joking around

*Ninjazz politely hugs Lil_B.
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/S4-huzXqyNE <3
<Barbetos> "Making frands in Ponaville taday!"
<Phase4> 00,02Ninjazz, yeah, disapointed that soi is going nowhere
<BoroBrony> HAHAHAHAH love that vid
<Ninjazz> Phase4, Ikr. It had so much going for it.
*Lil_B hugs AdamTheDuck and Ninjazz :)
<Lil_B> what is SoI ?
<Vivix> Shadow of israphel
<BoroBrony> aww i feel left out i no get hug :(
<Barbetos> Yeah. It took me a while to to think of a good welcome to the fandom video, but I came up with it finally BoroBrony
<Ninjazz> Shadow of Israphael. Yogcast's series that was popular.
<Vivix> It's a series by Yogscast
<BoroBrony> it was a very good choice :)
<Lil_B> oh :/ I never watched them, only know them by name :/
<Vivix> I prefer their tekkit series, because- until SoI get's a story or a goal, it feels a bit disjointed and weird, from a show standpoint
*AdamTheDuck licks BoroBrony :P
<Ninjazz> Feels like it's DRAAAAAAGING.
<BoroBrony> YAY :) :) :) :) :) :)
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, i look at it like its a really strange minecraft game, the tekkit series is fun
<Lil_B> btw AdamTheDuck di you wanted to hear the song I was talking about on... Tuesday I think?
<Ninjazz> Never have I seen someone so happy to be licked.
<Phase4> 00,02ohai LightTrooper105, i'm not entirely sure whats going on either
<AdamTheDuck> Song? I would love to anyway Lil_B :P
<Vivix> Yeah, Phase4 it's almost like a crazy adventure map
<BoroBrony> y not be happy with it lol
<Phase4> 00,02ohai to you too Silver_Spoon
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck ok :)
<LightTrooper105> someone ping me? o.o
<Phase4> 00,02LightTrooper105,
<Ninjazz> LightTrooper105.
<Barbetos> I am begining to think if you put the word Gangnam style in your youtube video name you will instantly get a million views
<Lil_B> LightTrooper105 nope xD
<LightTrooper105> ok...
<LightTrooper105> well back to hitman sniper challange!
<Phase4> 00,02LightTrooper105, no one pinged you, it is in your imagination
<LightTrooper105> perhaps..
<Phase4> 00,02LightTrooper105, totaly imagining it
<Phase4> 00,02LightTrooper105, still no pings
<LightTrooper105> pings... pings x.x
<Lil_B> what internet? why y so slow all of a sudden?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm bored btw
<Ninjazz> LightTrooper105, he's not pinging you. You are.
<prince-dari> Barbetos: You'll get those million views faster if you have the word 'tits' in your title.
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Barbetos> Gangam tits style sex tapes
<BoroBrony> yeah as soon as they go in you get 10000 views
<BoroBrony> nice title i would click it lol :P
<Vivix> There's..maating videos with 14 million views
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck http://soundcloud.com/missing-reaction/shin-onigashima-traditional
<Ninjazz> I was going to post this yesterday, but seeing chat's current topic, this seems almost appropriate. http://i.imgur.com/80cLo.jpg
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/wa6NfkuDTO8 Meletric, one of my favourite pony artists, even if it's just one song
<Barbetos> Mmmm. The new UKF wubs
<Barbetos> They sustain me
<AdamTheDuck> Ninjazz, oh God wat XD
<Ninjazz> I had the people in class laughing too loud in class when I was doing that one.
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back from braekfast
<Dark92Enigma> breakfast*
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai agian Dark92Enigma, chat is back to life :3
<Lil_B> ... appearently Sounmdcloud is making a Halo 4 Remix Contest Oo
<Lil_B> hey Dark92Enigma !
<AdamTheDuck> Ehh Halo 4...
<Dark92Enigma> HI Lil_B !
<Barbetos> Get your local church choir in on the halo 4 remix
<Barbetos> You will win.
<Dark92Enigma> So, are you guys ready for movie night?
<AdamTheDuck> Story ended at 3, I wonder why they are still dragging a 4th...
<Barbetos> MONEY!!
<Ninjazz> Go for gold, get your local monastory in it.
<Ninjazz> (sp)
<Barbetos> That and they need to sell more xboxes
<Vivix> Microsoft has a 5000 usd competition on W8 apps
<Barbetos> Cause lets face it, halo is the only worth while exclusive on xbox aparently.
<Vivix> Competitions are good advertisement
<Dark92Enigma> We start out NOSTALGIAWEEN with Ghostbusters and Yu-Gi-Oh The Pyramid Of Light
<Ninjazz> Mmmm. I wouldn't credit them for it.
<Lil_B> maybe make another traditional Remix of a Songs XD ... Halo 4 in Zen ... sounds about right XD
<Barbetos> Windows 8 makes me want to start using other operating systems
<Vivix> Eh, it won't affect me
<BoroBrony> anyone here getting halo 4
<Ninjazz> Dude, it's the Windows patturn. The next OS after Windows 8 will be better.
<Vivix> haven't played Halo since..2003 or what it is
<Barbetos> I bought ODST and played it once. I think I have Reach too.
<Barbetos> So no.
<prince-dari> Windows 8 is designed for touch screens anyway
<Vivix> yeah,
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 we are all forced to use Linux due to Windoes 8 XD
<Vivix> so it's TARGET is, not me
<Lil_B> I won't get Halo 4 nor Windows 8 :P
<AdamTheDuck> Windows*
<Ninjazz> Wut. Then it's a tablet OS.
<Barbetos> I am fine with linux
<Vivix> so, yeah good for them, but I'm not gonna have any need for it
<Barbetos> i will learn
<Ninjazz> Why is it on computers?
<prince-dari> Touch screen monitors are a thing, you know
<prince-dari> :P
<Lil_B> yeah, even the creators they it's a Tablet OS ... but unfortunetly THEY DON'ÄT MARKET IT LIKE ONE!
<Vivix> yeah
<AdamTheDuck> Barbetos, I'll learn, eventually XD
<Vivix> it's not exclusively for computers, though
<Ninjazz> Must be expensive as hell. o_o
<Vivix> I haven't seen a single ad for W8, just for creating content for it
<Vivix> so I can't say they market it to me
<AdamTheDuck> Well that was very different Lil_B
<Barbetos> So is bronystate down?
<Vivix> Dad downloaded Debian I think, and accidentally got the touchscreen version
<Vivix> terrible experience
<Vivix> none of us have used Linux for--ages and ages, so all the things we knew were hard to do, and all the new things on that distro was confusing
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck I know, very Japanese, and I still have to get the Mastering right :/
<Vivix> we weren't able to login as superuser either <,<
<shana> Vivix: are you sure that was debian..
<Vivix> not at all sure
<Vivix> but it was a touchscreen version of a linux distro
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, that would be first I've heard of traditional Japanese music, very interesting.
<Barbetos> Oh yeah that reminds me. When there was talk of keyboard and mouse being phased out I laughed
<Barbetos> Who ever started that topic does not play games
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/Ox6H20zMo8U
<Vivix> well not only games
<Vivix> I don't care about that part, even if it would suck
<Ninjazz> Hahahaha. Phasing out the keyboard and mouse.
<Vivix> but WORK with a touchscreen would be HORRIBLE
<shana> I don't know any touchscreen linux distros with the exception of android :/
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck well... what I think is traditional Japanese anyway :P I only heard 2 songs I think that were 100% japanese Essemble
<Vivix> I don't know what it was exactly, but I think it was a light version of Debian
<Ninjazz> Do they REALLY think that touchscreens are the future?
<Vivix> Probably not, but you know, marketing
<Ninjazz> Pffft. Gimmicks.
<Vivix> a work environment such as programmers and offices, really do not benefit from touchscreen
<Barbetos> here is my ad for touchscreens "Touch your porn."
<Vivix> maybe as an added simplicity, but without keyboard and mouse in addition, it's probably harder on your hands and slows your work
<Barbetos> I can imagine it now. Some one walks in on you looking at porn, you go to close it on your touch screen and bust the thing from hitting so hard it falls over.
<Barbetos> GREAT IDEAAAAA
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> When you walk in on someone, and their turn off their screen
<Vivix> you know it's time to leave the room
<Vivix> they*
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Vivix :<
<Barbetos> Anymore I just leave it up and stare at the person, and continue.
<Vivix> !
<Barbetos> Why should it ruin the mood?
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Oh that would be awkward
<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, problem is windows 8 is terrible even with a touchscreen
<Vivix> are you leaving AdamTheDuck ;_;?
<BoroBrony> ha
<AdamTheDuck> Oh wait, I just read the second part Vivix XD
<Vivix> hehehe
<Barbetos> Okay back to windows 8
<prince-dari> Eh, I haven't tried it, so I can't pass judgement
<Barbetos> Good idea Phase4 XD
<Vivix> I haven't tried it or reada bout it
<Ryunosuke> so microsoft is going the way of Star trek movies? Every other one is a good one? :)
<Phase4> 00,02i tried it out for a bit, interface is just slow
<Vivix> Aah
<Barbetos> Installed it on a work computer. Did not like it
<Phase4> 00,02it looks shiny and colourful but transitions are slow, metro as a replacement for the start menu is slow, buttons are far apart making mouse movements slow
<Phase4> 00,02metro also wastes a lot of screen space
<Barbetos> I had a hard time. I really could not get along without a start menu
<Barbetos> Which is really kind of sad when I think about it
<Vivix> Hm
<Vivix> I know the dev version is out now for the W8 app competition, maybe I should try it
<Ninjazz> Just get the OS after Windows 8, they ALWAYS need a test run before getting it right. :T
<Phase4> 00,02it's poorly designed, and removing the start menu was the stupidest thing they could have done
<Vivix> I don't like tablet computers though
<Phase4> 00,02it would have been trivial to not remove it
<Vivix> I thouht someone said you could reactivate it?
<Ninjazz> Like how Vista was bad, then they came out with Win 7.
<Phase4> 00,02not to mention its still full of bugs and incompatabilities
<Phase4> 00,02especialy with games, d3d has been locked down real hard and most games perform horribly
<BoroBrony> i hate vista that dam error tone grrrrrr
<Vivix> Hey totally unrelated; you can't use javascript to recognize events the browser does not catch, is there any other way to send signals from a tablet to a browser plugin or something? Like jTablet did?
<Vivix> I think w8 target is tiny apps and reading news-
<Vivix> I just haven't been exposed to news or information about it, barely even seen it-
<Ninjazz> Oh gawd wat.
<Ninjazz> Apps for Windows?
<Vivix> W8
<Vivix> look at it like windows attempt at android
<Ninjazz> Hehehe. The current trend. -_-
<Ninjazz> APPS.
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, nah, its windows attempt at apple
<Ninjazz> Didn't they learn their lesson from that Zune thing?
<Phase4> 00,02and them forgetting that most of the reason windows still exists is corperate installations
<Phase4> 00,02Ninjazz, aparently not
*Ninjazz rolls his eyes.
<Ryunosuke> I actually use w7 home :p
<Ryunosuke> simply because it is ... reminiscent of Win xp
<Vivix> Hehe
<Phase4> 00,02Ryunosuke, i'm sorry, i can't hear you over the sound of my compositing window manager
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<Vivix> Maybe the contest is over, can't find it: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/apps
<Vivix> I just don't see W8 as an attempt at replacing W7
<Vivix> so I honestly never cared-
<Ninjazz> Oh btw. This is a long shot, but does anyone know how to install Win 7 onto a notebook that doesn't have a DVD/CD drive?
<Vivix> usb
<Ninjazz> That works?
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, the requirements for the windows store have been released
<Vivix> A friend of mine did it- with a cracked version, but it should work anyway
<Vivix> probably a guide online
<Vivix> Phase4, oh?
<Ninjazz> Facedesk. Goddamnit. That's all?!
<Phase4> 00,02they're a little draconian and preclude a lot of existing applications
<Vivix> Aah
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<Vivix> Yo
<Ninjazz> Hey Sith.
<Bronysith> why is bronystate down?
<Phase4> 00,02and if you want to use a managed language, say python or java, well you can't. .net or nothing
<Vivix> but you know, that 5000 dollar award was definitely to make a slew of simple apps
<Vivix> ahh-
<Phase4> 00,02if you do it has to be packaged with your app, making it many times larger, and even then the wording is a little vague
<Vivix> I know most of those apps in the contest was javascript and html5-
<Vivix> like chrome apps
<Bronysith> oy
<Bronysith> why is bronystate down?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Bronysith
<Vivix> Noones streaming, dunno why
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, but its a bad idea to base your apps around html when your html engine is internet explorer
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, no idea
<Vivix> yyeah-
<Vivix> I mean IE9 in many cases worked better than Chrome to me during testing my code
<Ninjazz> We're being invaded again.
<Vivix> buut--it's still WEIRD
<Vivix> microsoft has a tendency to do--weird shit to ensure monopoly
<Vivix> I don't feel I know enough about each browser to make a call there-
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, lookup 'alternate data streams', something implimented in ntfs to compete with apple who has a similar but much more sane thing
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, also make sure you have sysinternals, just about the only microsoft application that is aware of the existance of ads is the streams utility from that
<Vivix> "This way, a 4GB movie could be stored in an 1kB text document"
<Vivix> Woah
<Vivix> aah
<Phase4> 00,02a 4GB movie could be stored in a 0 byte anything
<Ninjazz> That seems and sounds impossible.
<Vivix> Yeah Ie sounds--
<Vivix> microsofty
<Phase4> 00,02Ninjazz, google 'alternate data streams'
<Ninjazz> More techincal talk. /)>_<(\
<Sylandest> ^
*Vivix is technonoob, but is learning
<Vivix> Learning is fuun
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, i found out about them accidentally a year ago or so, rediscovered them today while experimenting
<Vivix> aah sick-
<Vivix> I wonder how much it affects-
<Phase4> 00,02its actually usefull, i can store different cache entries as different streams in the same file and to wipe the entire cache i can delete that one file
<Vivix> hm
<Phase4> 00,02or at least it would be if it were possible to list the streams in a file
<Vivix> so you can store files with a eh 'clientside' language?
<Phase4> 00,02or if the files on disk size included the streams
<Phase4> 00,02or if ANYTHING was aware of them
<Bronysith> i love /mlp/
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, i dont know what that is but it sounds like pony
<Vivix> 4chan ponyboard
<Bronysith> its the 4chan board for ponies
<Phase4> 00,02le-away-to-forchan
<Vivix> so what can you use ADS for? For storage of information for like... databases and stuff?
<Bronysith> after im done browsing /mlp/ im goign to play some doom
<Vivix> I see html has Local DB now-
<Bronysith> and then eat Phase4 s face
<Phase4> 00,02D:
<AdamTheDuck> Not if I nom Phase4 first
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<Sylandest> you fools
<Sylandest> I've already eaten his entire existence!
<Ninjazz> Suprising enough, Ponychan and /mlp/ hate each other.
<adb39> good morning bronystate!
<Sylandest> morning, adb39
<adb39> well, afternoon
<AdamTheDuck> Hello adb39
<Ninjazz> Hey adb39.
<Bronysith> i have yhet to go to ponychan
<BoroBrony> afternoon :)
<Kammerjunk> This thing called love. I just can't handle it.
<adb39> hang on, let me change into something more comfortable
<Ninjazz> Only been to ponychan for the Desktop Ponies thread.
<Ninjazz> SPAI.
<Vivix> Never been to any of those
<Saturn> lulz
<Bronysith> hi Saturn can i snuggle yous?
<Saturn> aaand
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut XD
<Saturn> why isn't it opping me...
<Ninjazz> You've been demotted. :c
<Kammerjunk> You dun goofed.
*AdamTheDuck licks Saturn
<Vivix> Phase4, do you know Faye?
<Saturn> that's better
<Saturn> 8,1even better now
<ImOkayWithThis|> Yay! Haiyo Saturn !
<Bronysith> HAHAHA boba fett riding rainbow dash
<Saturn> 8,1i'm on the chat from uni, because my server is currently being moved
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning Saturn
<Saturn> 8,1hey ImOkayWithThis!
<Ninjazz> Anyways, if there was one thing I noticed about ponychan and /mlp/, it was that ponychan was ALOOOOOT more kinder in terms of dealing with anons.
<Vivix> mlp is probably 4channy and elitist
<Ninjazz> /mlp/ is still part of 4chan afterall.
<Vivix> "I hate ignorance" ignorant people
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_MSlvkrKPc
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: 4chan generally is 4channy, yes. /mlp/ is no exception, from what I've seen.
*Saturn 8,1is totally being productive by being on Reddit
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah- well, they're allowed their fun too
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, i dont know faye
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, PRODUCTIVITY
<Vivix> I couldn't figure out Node.js on my own, still tons to learn- so I used Faye as a client to Node.js- still a lot to learn but it's a simple publish and subscribe thing
<Ninjazz> Here you go, Saturn. http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3667-1331797496419.gif
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, speaking of which do you have a bitbucket account?
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, also i need to bother you for other things
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, bother bother bother
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, bother
<Sylandest> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Dat bother
<Sylandest> lol-ed
<Barbetos|AtWork> I like the part when he stops moving
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, its back online, not sure why it went down
<Ninjazz> Phase4 is very bored.
<Phase4> 00,02might bother the host about it
<BoroBrony> :)
<twilight_sprinkle> was bronystate just down?
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, yeah
<Bronysith> thats much better
<twilight_sprinkle> something happened to the server?
<Bronysith> oh /mlp/ how naughty you are

<Vivix> There's very few episodes I avoid watching
<AdamTheDuck> wait why did I do a /me?
<Bronysith> but the only reason people vote for that episode IS BECAUSE OF THE SONG
<Vivix> I forgot the song was in
<Ninjazz> It's a good episode. The song is a plus.
<Vivix> Sylands Hest
<Vivix> still can't get that out of my head mr Sylandest
<Bronysith> applejack needs another episode, she only has 1 in the entire series while everypony else has 3 per season

<Vivix> my math teacher was a shy nervous wreck who were too scared to yell at us, but SO smart, fresh out of school and very excited about explaining HOW things worked, which actually made me remember how to do math problems rather than "Just cuz thats how u do it"
