<Nazkan> AWWW HE DID IT!
<Shane377> now that the season has finished it honestly feels like a void
<Sumica> 00,10seems legit

<Kandarihu> Banana Juice: Smuggled
<cow334> yaay oh nuuu

<Dken2021> ohai andros and gohma
<cow334> Sumica: haha
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Sumica: :D
<Nazkan> What ever happened to King K, that guy was awesome.

<RX-78-SweetieBot> If it isnt actually the most epic mlp thing on the internet, you will be punished
<RaveBrony> Rodonies: Its considered rude :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Because it can be considered rude
<Kammerjunk> Rodonies: It's rude.
<Sumica> 00,10It's rude to the person streaming

<Kandarihu> Oh, you voted Pirate. And the consensus was on Ninjas.
<Ninjazz> YOU

<Kandarihu> Bah. Naruto actually stayed on U.S. TV. One Piece was ruined forever by 4Kids
<Ninjazz> Poor Pinkie Pie.
<Dken2021> nothing betther than pecan pie
<Sumica> 00,10Pop out seems to have fixed it.
<Ninjazz> ^
<OneTrickPony> wut
<EpicMattTime> spit
<Phase4> strange
<Shane377> eww who swallows it?
<Sumica> 00,10So any one else find the prediction thing to be silly?
<Phase4> ^
<Shane377> swallowing gum can make it get stuck in ur colon
*Phase4
<OneTrickPony> lol wut
<Shane377> ??
<Ninjazz> Nintendo is such a silly filly. :)
<Sumica> 00,10realy who is going to answer one way then predict the poll going the other way?
<Kammerjunk> Shane377: And watching TV gives you square eyes.
<Sumica> 00,10dat hunt and peck typeing.
<Kandarihu> Answering the poll is expressing your own opinion. Answering the prediction is percieving how society would react.
<Phase4> inb4 unicorns win
<Shane377> u did realise chewin gum was designed not to break down
<Ninjazz> ^
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, hello everypony.:)
<Phase4> ohai TheRainbowDash
<Dken2021> lali-ho TheRainbowDash
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash, welcome.
<Kandarihu> Um, SuperBrony64, this isn't just going out to Bronies.
<Kammerjunk> Shane377: Neither is most anything humans have ever made.
<Ninjazz> I think "pony" gives it away though.
<Shane377> so thus it just stays inside ur stomach
<Kammerjunk> I ate a nail once.
<Kammerjunk> I don't still have it in my stomach.
<Phase4> cant wait to see the result of that
<Sumica> 00,10Yeah but every one is going to pick the same answer they chose Kandarihu. thuse the poll will stack
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, what is this? Question time on the Wii?
<Shane377> lol u pass it out
<Dken2021> Kammerjunk um... wow
<Shane377> but since a chewy is sticky
<RainBowJack> SuperBrony64 make a poll : Are you a Brony?
<Shane377> it sticks k
<Ninjazz> Yep, TheRainbowDash.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02lol
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, ok..
<Ninjazz> ...

<SuperBrony64> 11,02No :>
<Ninjazz> I prefer cereal.
<TheRainbowDash> What..
<Ninjazz> :3
<Kammerjunk> Shane377: No. Your stomach can't break down a piece of gum the same way it breaks down normal food, but your digestive system can still move it along through normal intestinal activity.

<Mutterguy> *bromide
*Ninjazz gratefully leaves the weird and perveted Trixie alone
<ctcb> I was playing Cadences song "This day" from the finale, and I turned it deeper to see what it sounds like, and guessâ€¦ what happened! (Hint: Something on my computer broke)
<ofna01> for during movie night Yama
<ofna01> monitor?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> bacause one room with 3000 people is never good
<RawketLawnchair> Aw shit, Anomoly.
<Mutterguy> the speakers?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm gonna put on my cat ears now.
<Dken2021> YamaTHou usually when there are new episodes playing, it gets crazy and spammy, so it's to filter it out a bit
<RawketLawnchair> Should have kept the base.
<ctcb> Mutterguy: Correct, My macbook speakers blew with a VERY loud left popâ€¦
<ctcb> I can only use headphones now
<YamaTHou> ooow
<Spell-of-Cats> :3
<YamaTHou> people here are really helpfull
<Spell-of-Cats> Meoooow
*Phase4 cant wait for season 3
<YamaTHou> Phase4 we too
<YamaTHou> me too**
<Dken2021> neither can the rest of the community
*ctcb hopes Phase4 hopes John de Lancie is going to be voicing discord in season 3...
<YamaTHou> when will be aired?
<Ninjazz> Bronies are apparently really helpful and cool.
<Phase4> ctcb: search eqd
<Phase4> trust me
<Dken2021> no one knows atm
<dishwasher_EXTREME> they crashed ?,,...
<Phase4> no, we know. its on eqd
<YamaTHou> but there will be a season 3?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> yes
<Dken2021> but it might air somewhere in fall
<ctcb> Phase4: John De Lancie confirmed he is doing a Major voice for season 3â€¦ but he hasn't said whichâ€¦
<Phase4> oh, WHAT he's doing
<Phase4> ctcb: double check eqd, i think he did
<Ninjazz> No one knows for certain.
<Ninjazz> He could be voicing a pony for all we know.
<YamaTHou> ooow
<dishwasher_EXTREME> whos John De Lancie
<Phase4> allso, john de lancie might be a brony
<Ninjazz> I SENSE A CELESTIA EPISODE!
<YamaTHou> yeah
<RawketLawnchair> De Lancie is the guy who voiced Discord.
<Dken2021> dishwasher_EXTREME he was an actor on star trek, also discord's va
<YamaTHou> how about a episode for backround ponies
<Phase4> he voiced Q
<dishwasher_EXTREME> luna needs more episode
<Phase4> YamaTHou: WANT
*Phase4 wants that
<RawketLawnchair> Who's Luna ?
<Phase4> and a scootaloo episode
<RawketLawnchair> Fnar fnar.
<DavidCortez> Good morning everypony :)
<Dken2021> morning DavidCortez
<YamaTHou> yeah
<ofna01> Sumi,you have Counter Striker 1.6?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i have
<YamaTHou> I wanna ask about scootaloo
<YamaTHou> where does she live?
<RawketLawnchair> Again, who the hell is Luna? Sounds like some lame OC.
<Phase4> YamaTHou: ponyvile
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i sucks at fps
<YamaTHou> with who?
<Phase4> :P
<YamaTHou> by herself?
<Dken2021> RawketLawnchair probably some mary sue
*Phase4 shrugs
<RawketLawnchair> Dken2021: Sounds about right.
<Ninjazz> With her parents of course.
<Ninjazz> But we honestly just don't know.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> who is scootaloo parents
<YamaTHou> exactly
<Phase4> dishwasher_EXTREME: who knows
<ofna01> dishwasher
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ZUES
<ofna01> do you want to play with meh?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> quick question, if Cadence is Celestias niece, does that make her Luna's daughter?
<Ninjazz> No.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i deleted that game because i sucks at it
<RawketLawnchair> I dunno.
<Kandarihu> That's right. We need to see Scootaloo's family.
<Phase4> i can link you to a fanfic that has applejack and rainbow dash as scootaloo's parents, the explination is suprisingly rational
<Ninjazz> We don't know the blood lines.
<Dken2021> who are scootaloo's parents? is it, the texas cowboys? the greenbay packers? the egyptians?
<YamaTHou> I think not
<Ninjazz> Phase4: wut.
<YamaTHou> Maybe she has more sisters
<RawketLawnchair> Dken2021: Scoots parents are hippies.
<ofna01> scoot scoot scoot-a-chicken
<Phase4> Ninjazz: wait until you read it
<Ninjazz> :/
<Ninjazz> Tactical Nuke Inbound.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> mlp have many aliens character with no clear origin
<Kandarihu> I guess what was revealed of Cadance's past rules out her being related to Luna.
<ofna01> DAMN
<Phase4> and then everythign died
<Ninjazz> Awww.
<ofna01> you blew up the planet!
<Phase4> i think its more of a case that the nuke sucks
<YamaTHou> hahaha
<Phase4> you have to be outside of cover while charging it
<Ninjazz> Nukes always suck.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> its a nuke, its gonna have a big range
<ofna01> Sumi,please play the Season 2 Finale
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i working on one right now !!!
<ofna01> PWETTY PL0X
<Kandarihu> Nuclear bombs are only good for brandishing.
<YamaTHou> can I ask another thing
<Ninjazz> Go ahead.
<YamaTHou> so were gonna mass effect 2 all long?
<ctcb> Phase4: He said he was doing a voice for season 3, he didn't say it was discord. ( http://i.imgur.com/key72.png )
<Phase4> when that thing goes and they start flying XD it looks so goofy
<Phase4> ctcb: ah
<Ninjazz> Until Wrek gets on or so.
<Phase4> ctcb: theres allso a video of an interview
<ofna01> ya think Wrek will stream it?
<ctcb> Phase4: Where?
<Phase4> ctcb: somewhere on eqd
<YamaTHou> so when will be watching other things?
<Phase4> Ninjazz: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/836/Double-Rainbow
<Phase4> its full of wut
<YamaTHou> so when we will be watching other thins?
<Ninjazz> I am prepared for it, Phase4. :D
<Phase4> trust me
<Phase4> you're not
<Dken2021> YamaTHou yea, but that depends if the streamer wants to do soemthing else
<Phase4> heck, the guy explains it to you and its still wut
<Tarku> good morning everypony
*Tarku hugs everpony :3
*Phase4 hugs Tarku back
<ctcb> Phase4: How far back? Equestria Daily is a big placeâ€¦ :D
<Phase4> ctcb: just use the search, its fairly recent
<Kandarihu> I found a video where he DID admit that it's Discord, but he's very disconnected from the rest of the VAs. It's like he's giving speeches in the voice of Discord and he doesn't know how they're going to use his voice.
<ctcb> Phase4: Any ideas on the title?
<Ninjazz> Phase4: The author's profile picture scares me. o_o
<YamaTHou> wooo
<Phase4> Ninjazz: huh, used to be something different
<Ninjazz> Welp. I guess I'll give it read sometime. XAX wants me to read Party in Pink.
<Ninjazz> But I am honestly turned off my most AppleDash fics.
<YamaTHou> speaking of reading
<Ninjazz> by*
<ctcb> Phase4: This? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=GWT-Yv0KXQI
<YamaTHou> anypony ever read my little dashie?
<Ninjazz> Most of us have.
<Dken2021> I think everyone has, but not me
<Spell-of-Cats> I've read it. :3 Meooooooow
<Phase4> ctcb: i found a different one, would look for it but i've got tech things to do

<YamaTHou> after reading it,it makes me hate reality T_T
<Ninjazz> Hehehe.
<Ninjazz> ROB sure made himself a fic.
<Ninjazz> MLD was actually the thing that made me a brony.
<YamaTHou> wow
<YamaTHou> how?
<Ninjazz> What do you mean how?
<Spell-of-Cats> More like 'why'
<Ninjazz> Oh.
<Ninjazz> Well...
<YamaTHou> I mean.you read it first before watching the actual show?
<Ninjazz> YamaTHou: Well, no. I was actually up to episode 13 before I actually read it.
<YamaTHou> oow
<Ninjazz> I wasn't actually a brony then...
<Ninjazz> I was just... How do you say this...
<Ninjazz> I didn't want to be associated with "bronies"
<Spell-of-Cats> A fan?
<Ninjazz> Exactly, Sumi.
<RawketLawnchair> I justl ove that WOOOOOAH.
<ctcb> What's the chances of Discord returning?
<Ninjazz> I can give you my bio page on FIMfic explaining everything.
<Ninjazz> Its long...
<Ninjazz> Ehh. Fine.
<YamaTHou> hmm...is it that long?
<Spell-of-Cats> I would love to read it while I'm not doing anything.
<YamaTHou> I mean veryyyyy long?
<Spell-of-Cats> Meooooow
<Ninjazz> Yes. VERY LONG>
<YamaTHou> is worth to read?
<Ninjazz> And I'd hate to ruin like 2 hours of me writing down the damn thing.
<RawketLawnchair> Antigar? It's the one planet that can defeat the mecha from TTGL.
<Ninjazz> Well. I have had two people, XAX and the author of Heart of a Dragon, have called it a very good read.
<Kandarihu> I've been showing my mom FiM for a couple months now. And yesterday evening, she came home saying that someone that her favorite Talk Radio host was interviewing sounded very similar to Applejack. I believe she qualifies as a Brony now.
<YamaTHou> fine...I'll read it :)
<Spell-of-Cats> May I read it?
<YamaTHou> link?
<Ninjazz> Very short summury. It is the story about how I first met MLP FiM and how I came to terms with being a brony.
<Ninjazz> Alright. Gimme a second.
<Ninjazz> And ofcourse you can, Spell-of-Cats.
<Ninjazz> Everything, Sumi.
<Spell-of-Cats> Okay, I'm putting away my cat ears now.
<Ninjazz> http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Ninjazz - not as long as I remembered it to be.
<YamaTHou> for people in this room.how did you become a brony?
<Ninjazz> lol
<ofna01> Phase
<ofna01> this fic is giving me a headache
<ofna01> XD
<Ninjazz> Surprised me by just how much people actually called a good writer just for my BIO page.
<YamaTHou> oow
<Dken2021> I noticed alot of pony related stuff on a forum I go on, so yea
<Ninjazz> But if you don't wanna read my bio page, what actually got me into the show was the actual show. But I first met MLP FiM as... Pony Porn. Hence me becoming a hater.
<Dken2021> only a matter of time
<dishwasher_EXTREME> hey guys just got back from dinner what did i miss
<Phase4> dat unloc
<Phase4> unlock'
<YamaTHou> eeew pony porn...
<Ninjazz> Yeah...
<YamaTHou> do you really jackoff to that?
<Ninjazz> DONT ASK ME!
<ofna01> Phase,this fic is giving me a headache
<YamaTHou> I know their cute but jacking off to them makes me sick
<dishwasher_EXTREME> wtf i just eat dont make me puke ninjazz

<Ninjazz> Ahh.
<Ninjazz> Yeah.
<Phase4> escilate defences,needs more power
<Phase4> so you give it power?
<UnFoundBug> you know what, i may be back but i dont think i want any idea as to what led to that conversation
<Spell-of-Gaming> Holy crap... That was soooo good.
<Ninjazz> Well, it makes a WHOLE lot freakin sense when i wrote it down. I actually took my time to remember how I took things.
<Phase4> still sounds like a bad idea
<Ninjazz> Holy crap, Spell-of-Gaming. Did you like it that much>
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Sumica: it looks like your trying to restore this facility, would you like some help? :P
<Phase4> lol puzle
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yeah, it was really good, Ninjazz.
<YamaTHou> hahahaha
<YamaTHou> then I heard fluttershy yay :D
<Ninjazz> Well... Thank you, Spell-of-Gaming.
<Phase4> if it works it works
<Ninjazz> It warms my heart that people actually take time to read that. My bio page of all things.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yeah, it was really good, Ninjazz.
<YamaTHou> I'll read it later Ninjazz
<Spell-of-Gaming> Lol accidental
<Ninjazz> Do as you please, YamaTHou. :)
<RainbowcrashNBurn> evil shep looks awesome :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> Accidental up arrow button
<Ninjazz> No one is forcing you.
<Ninjazz> Thank you, Spell-of-Gaming. Really.
<YamaTHou> I really want to read it
<Spell-of-Gaming> That was a really big cycle
<YamaTHou> but its been a blast being here
<RainbowcrashNBurn> cant have that 26%
<Drake> 04At least "sharing" information is better than SOPA
<Dken2021> so just realized how old granny smith is, know how she said she practically founded ponyville, and how twilight said winter wrap up has been a ponyville tradition for hundreds of years?
<Ninjazz> O_O
<Ninjazz> Good lord...
<Spell-of-Gaming> In my headcanon, the ponies have 2 birthdays.
*Dken2021 shrugs
<Ninjazz> Well. er. No.
<Ninjazz> I never thought about it like that...
<RainbowcrashNBurn> an eccentric old lady being senile? what are the chances of that! :P
<Ninjazz> ^
<Kandarihu> You know, maybe they have short years on the planet that Equestria exists on.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> back again what r we talking about ?6_9
<YamaTHou> and yeah...we don't know what is live span of a pony is
<Spell-of-Gaming> 1 for the actual birthday, and the other is for the day when they got their cutie mark
<YamaTHou> is the*
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i wonder how people would react if they put humans into season 3
<YamaTHou> @_@
<Ninjazz> All we do know about age is that Celestia and Luna have lived forever.
<Dken2021> perhaps mixed results RainbowcrashNBurn
<dishwasher_EXTREME> DONT PUT HUMANS IN
<copony> no please
<Spell-of-Gaming> But, Iron Will is practically a human!
<Ninjazz> I wouldn't mind them. Would be weird as hell though.
<YamaTHou> wait wait.....celestia and luna are immortals right???how about cadence?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> who knows, we may get the return of the sea ponies in the human episode :P
<dishwasher_EXTREME> NOT THE SEAPONIES
<Spell-of-Gaming> Aren't minotaurs half human?
<RawketLawnchair> Tia's a dumb nkckname.
<Ninjazz> Well, I assume that because Celestia and Luna have lived for 1,000 years AT LEAST.
<Ninjazz> Why not go an extra thousand or so? :D
<dishwasher_EXTREME> so what do u want to call her ? celest?
<YamaTHou> and how about princess cadence??? is she immortal?
<Dken2021> well the immortal thing is fanmade really
<YamaTHou> she is a alicorn right?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Now, CENATAURS, that's probably weird
<dishwasher_EXTREME> tia must have parents right ?
<Ninjazz> I read in a good fic that her name was Celly. Is that one better?
<Ninjazz> Right,
<Ninjazz> Good point.
<YamaTHou> better than tia
<dishwasher_EXTREME> if tia is thousand of years old then her parent would be ....OH MY THE FACT IS UNREAL !!:O
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Alicorns arent even mentioned in show, its a fan given thing right?
<Ninjazz> Yeah ^
<YamaTHou> yeah
<Spell-of-Gaming> Well, the name is
<Kandarihu> Winged Unicorns
<Ninjazz> Pegacorns...
<YamaTHou> I think Alicorn is much more better
<Spell-of-Gaming> In myths, they're more known as winged unicorns
<YamaTHou> its more catchy :D
<Ninjazz> Very catchy.
<Renard> Have some Lyra: http://i.imgur.com/vPVEP.png
<dishwasher_EXTREME> how old is tia parents ?
<YamaTHou> Reanar lol XD
<Ninjazz> Renard: :D
<YamaTHou> Renard*
<Ninjazz> "Celly" and "Lulu", as far as we know, have no parents.
<Ninjazz> They just came to be.
<YamaTHou> poof...just like that?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> yes but WHAT IF...HOW OLD WOULD THEY BE
<RainbowcrashNBurn> was cadence named before or after "this day aria" was written? mainly because of the techniques used in the song
<Ninjazz> Well as far as things can go. Yes, poof.
<Spell-of-Gaming> QUARTER of the things the fandom made are my headcanon
<copony> i think nobody knows
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: seems legit
<Dken2021> YamaTHou it worked for Arceus

<YamaTHou> hahaha
<Ninjazz> TBH the MLP crew just make up things as they go and TRY not to contridict themselves too much.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> they would probably be 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000....... years old
<Ninjazz> Don't do that.
<YamaTHou> yeah man...dont flood
<YamaTHou> by the way....
<Spell-of-Gaming> Actually, they're probably more like 5,000 years
<YamaTHou> so what do you do (pony related)on your spare on the computer if there are no more pony episodes?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i watch avatar
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<Kandarihu> My theory is that since pony genetics allows two Earth Ponies to give birth to Unicorns and Pegasi, it would be possible, albeit EXTREMELY rare for a Winged Unicorn to be born. And any that ARE born have the legal standing of a male Gerudo.
<Ninjazz> I play game. Re watch MLP episodes. I need to get to Avatar - Legend of Korra.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> aquabats is 2nd best show evar :3
<copony> desktop ponies an watch fanart
<Ninjazz> Jeez, MLP HAS TAKEN OVER MY LIFE!
<Ninjazz> And I am glad for it...
<YamaTHou> Ninjazz brohoof.
<Ninjazz> :D
<RainbowcrashNBurn> dat can
<Ninjazz> It's a shocker everytime I think about it, Sumi.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Actually, they're probably more like 5,000 years
<Ninjazz> YamaTHou: /)
<Dken2021> I think I have too many pony wallpapers
<Ninjazz> I don't have enough.

<Tovler|depressed> neat. The Rayman Legends trailer was "leaked"
<dentidiot> ryamn ledgends?!
<dentidiot> there's a new one
<YamaTHou> I have another random question...I you dont mind to tell how old are you?and are you male or female?
<EonMastor> that ship w/ the spinning rings in it reminds me of the Bentusi from Homeworld
<YamaTHou> If you dont*
<valoreins> Ninjazz: and remember, i study in a university of arts and design here, so maybe i could find a potential creative brony here :)
<Ninjazz> I keep trying to get my few friends into MLP. But so far, my closest friend thinks its just weird. Even thought I keep proving how awesome it is.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SpringStingray: i have to finish a report on research i did on 3D technology and its future
<dentidiot> im 15 male
<Ninjazz> valoreins: :O More pony art!
<YamaTHou> im 14 male
<ofna01> 15 male
<Ninjazz> 17 guy

<SpringStingray> All that fru-fru cuddliness and laces
<YamaTHou> how about you Sumica?
<dentidiot> in the world today gray is the best colour
<Ninjazz> Maybe because MLP is better than MOST television right now.
<dentidiot> eyup
<Kandarihu> I hope that's not the case
<Ninjazz> No scratch that. IT IS BETTER.
<valoreins> let's turn off our TV and watch ponies in your laptop!
<dentidiot> YEAH
<valoreins> that's how today's world should be right now
<Kandarihu> Supposeing Friendship is Magic ends up jumping the shark in S3. The whole Brony movement will fall apart.
<YamaTHou> no...but its good to know :)...I was asking how old are you?
<ofna01> FIM WILL NEVER DIE
<dentidiot> i want a movie
<ofna01> NO
<dentidiot> they definately can do it
<Ninjazz> Its such a sad possibility.
<Ninjazz> But its true.
<valoreins> what's the meaning of "jumping the shark?" (sorry not native speaker)
<ofna01> every MLP movie has ended the generation
<YamaTHou> dentidiot I like your thinking
<dentidiot> hmm
<ofna01> its means it could end,val
<Ninjazz> It is a North American television program. We love to screw things up.
<valoreins> oh

<Meanwhile> Everytime Luna appeared in the pub we missed her lines because everyone went "AAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

<dentidiot> EEEEEEEVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLL
<UnFoundBug> i felt so bad for twilight at this point
<FlareChaser> Dat Twilight rage time.
<Dken2021> I object!
<dentidiot> :O
<Ninjazz> Time for draaaaamaaaaa.
<Magic> yep
<Commander_Shepard> They're all indoctrinated
<Meanwhile> Hat to the face.
<valoreins> I could imagine a team of Shining armor, Soarin, Big Mac and Fancypants....
<Dken2021> wait, this is a practice, nvm
<Litwick> And now, this is when the episode rolls downhill.
<dentidiot> she's evil
<Magic> twilight rraaaggge
<Ninjazz> Eviiiiiiiiil!
<Ninjazz> EVIL! EVIL EVIL!
<Litwick> The ONLY bad part of the episode.
<Meanwhile> His eyes go all 6_9
<dentidiot> /tp twilight candece
<derpy_pony> back in the good old times, insulting royalty was punished with a swift death
<valoreins> 6_9

<Ninjazz> Dat Rarity odd sound.
<Phase4> this bit
<dshannon> the monkey's!
<dentidiot> best acting
<Phase4> love this bit
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis has the same VA as Trixie, but I don't think Cadence does.
<Litwick> Everypony but Twilight was an ixdiot in this episode. And SPOILERS, they don't say sorry for being wrong.
<dentidiot> healing eh?
<FlareChaser> You Liar! Colgate would never do that :|
<valoreins> wedding makes ppl idiots...
<Kammerjunk> At this one moment in the two episodes, I seriously, genuinely hated Shining Armor.
<dentidiot> owned
<Sundaysmile> REJECTED!
<Dken2021> dentidiot of course, can't have black mages without white mages
<valoreins> good thing twi is an egghead..
<Ninjazz> Oi. Twilight just knows Cadence differently.
<derpy_pony> You failed, twilight!
<Litwick> Yeah, they NEVER aplogize for being wrong.
<FlareChaser> To the MOOOOOOOOOON!
<dentidiot> trolestia
<Ninjazz> Only she knew who Cadence was back then.
<derpy_pony> to the mooon!
<dshannon> fuq you celestia
<FlareChaser> Dat Animation.
<Ninjazz> Shut up.
<Meanwhile> I think we should assume they apologise later.
<dentidiot> AWW
<FlareChaser> D:
<Pinkies4thWall> Celestia spoke= SHIT GETS REAL
<Dken2021> well this is sad
<valoreins> they did apoligize right?
<derpy_pony> that's what you get for ruining his wedding
<UnFoundBug> cruash
<Kammerjunk> And even Celestia, who made Twilight her protege and who never questioned her before, was a jerk.
<Commander_Shepard> lol
<FlareChaser> Rageface.
<dentidiot> WELCOME TO YOUR DOOM!
<Kandarihu> Everyone was decieved. At this point, even Twilight Sparkle was convinced that that Cadance was genuine. If Chrysalis hadn't acted, her facade would've remained intact.
<Ninjazz> >_(\
<FlareChaser> Teleport out!
<UnFoundBug> inb4 MASSIVE anti-cadance
<FlareChaser> HURRY
<valoreins> i think everypony was indoctrinated, that explains the jerk effect
<dentidiot> hell portal
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: she had questioned twqilight before
<FlareChaser> Dat To be continued.
<Saturn> 08,01and she wasn't being a jerk
<dshannon> who here thought she was going to tartarus?
<Ninjazz> ^
<Kammerjunk> But not on anything that major.

<Snuffsis> Ohai there.
<Dken2021> lali-ho Snuffsis
<Ninjazz> Snuffsis, welcome.
<Commander_Shepard> everypony is just indoctrinated
<Meanwhile> I can't tell you how loud the "FUUUUUUUUUUUU"s were in the pub every time there was a break.
<Kammerjunk> She never even questioned that Twilight might not be on an ether trip, but had a reason to say what she did.
<Sundaysmile> yay!
<Commander_Shepard> but twilight is very strong
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: i wish i was there
<pavarkian> hmm
<pavarkian> indeed
<FlareChaser> is it bad that I went to a Achievement server on TF2?
<Evil_Spike> Yes
<dentidiot> epic intro
<Evil_Spike> Very yes
<Ninjazz> You know what's funny? ofna01 wanted to see this so bad. He is no longer here.
<dshannon> still doesn't explain how celestia doesn't even notice something is off
<Snuffsis> Anyone know which server Luna is making that Bronystate guild on for Guild Wars 2, or if anyone could get in touch with her for me? :3
<valoreins> Commander_Shepard: so you were weak when you were indoctrinated?
<Magic> it would be fun to live there
<FlareChaser> ....I do what I want.
<UnFoundBug> that shot reflects, but all subsequent explodes
<Commander_Shepard> yes
<Jaketehsnake> Oh Hai. OooH! Ryal Weddin'?
<FlareChaser> I am not banned yet, and there are MANY others that use them before me.
<dentidiot> yay
<Dken2021> I wonder how the cadance toy sales are going?
<Ninjazz> Jaketehsnake, Eyup. Welcome.
<valoreins> that explains your shitty ending commander... i feel sorry for that..
<FlareChaser> Dken2021: Very, VERY well
<Jaketehsnake> Ooh just in time for the epic PT2
<Jim> ohai Jaketehsnake
<dentidiot> Dken2021 a pink princess pony...
<derpy_pony> she should have banned twilight to the twelfth plane of eternal pain in the shadow realm....not just to a stupid cave right next to the palace
<Sundaysmile> mlp toys sales are the only things hasbro is making profits from
<Pinkies4th|mopping> Has dead-on instincts all the time; Isn't taken seriously.
<dentidiot> america
<Kammerjunk> There was no point in looking back. Buck no, not today, thank you kindly. A man on the move, and just sick enough to be totally confident.
<Meanwhile> Oh god

<dentidiot> these eps could have easily been a movie
<KaitoThePony> I need those birds
<Ninjazz> Ehhhh. Not sure how you would make a good movie out of it...
<Sundaysmile> I mean how many previous generation MLP movies were there?
<Lasharus> Suddenly over-popular franchises easily lead to movies.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I wouldn't be surprised
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: i tell you, if they do a movie, it'll gross soooo much
<CrimsonPhoenix> but will it be one theaters?
<Jim> Snuffsis: You are now aware that your jaw has weight and you have to hold it up

<Wrek|Observing> 05kinky jewelry, check.
<dshannon> you!
<Snuffsis> TheRandomkid321 What you talking about? DBZ Evolution was a masterpiece.
<EonMastor> Ninjazz, saying about not sure about how they'll make a movie. Easy to do if they make the villain actually hard to beat
<dentidiot> lol wrek
<FlareChaser> Sundaysmile: Yeah, she was a tank in our group.
<TheRandomkid321> Snuffsis Your kidding. your kidding right?
<Meanwhile> Sundaysmile: I know that feel. And it still isn't dead. T^T

<CrimsonPhoenix> Nooooo Luna you surely haven't
<Commander_Shepard> lunaaa
<Saturn> 08,01this episode makes me hate being single
<TheRandomkid321> ALLRIGHT!
<Litwick> Guys, wasn't Vinyl in the dark in this episode? That means her eyes still haven't been trechnically confirmed. All we know is it's a possible shade of red. Just throwing it out there.
<Ninjazz> Dat Vinyl!
<dentidiot> WOO
<CrimsonPhoenix> EYES
<Lasharus> In not just a fire, but in an inferno the size of armageddon.
<UnFoundBug> she sounds different to her ep
<Phase4> ohai luna
<Whiskra> no she doesnt
<Meanwhile> Litwick: they're magenta, deal w/ it
*dentidiot dances
<Commander_Shepard> celectia
<LauraP> does it make you hate being single or hate not having hooves?
<Malavolent> UnFoundBug: I think she sounds the same as in Luna Eclipsed.
<Ninjazz> I wonder just how many freaked out when they saw Vinyl... Then saw her eyes.
<derpy_pony> applejack can play the violin?
<Sundaysmile> fancy pants!
<KaitoThePony> FlareChaser: chosw you at random but did this message pinpoint to you and did it make a sound? (im new)
<kirzstryfe> 1,3MLP movie summary: peaceful times, enemy appears, enemy monologue, mane6 defeated, quest, evil monologue, epic battle, enemy defeated, peace
<Litwick> I don't have a problem with her magenta eyes. They IMO loom better than the fanon red eyes
<FlareChaser> KaitoThePony:
<Saturn> 08,01derpy_pony: all hillbillies can
<UnFoundBug> Ninjazz probably similar to when derpy showed up
<Lasharus> Decent summary kirz. :P

<Sundaysmile> the graphics in this game are amazing!
<Lasharus> Yes, but some games can rely on out-dated graphics but still remain visually pleasing.
<Ninjazz> Cya Meanwhile. Take care.
<Lasharus> This one seems to have some trouble with it :P
<Cobellanez> You people and your playing of good games before 7PM central
<TheRandomkid321> Im going to bed if I wish to eake up before movie night (mornign where I live)
<Sundaysmile> varying intricate tones of black
<Cobellanez> Cya TheRandomkid321
<pavarkian> dem voices
<Ninjazz> Wrek|Observing, don't wanna be that "pony" but the screen is completely black.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3pretty pictures are nice, but without decent gameplay they're not worth much
<pavarkian> sound so silly
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: But not compared to new games.
<The_Si> RIGHTO
<KaitoThePony> I don't get this game
<derpy_pony> Wrek|Observing: we can't see much in the stream. all the gfx are black
<pony_657677> hi
<Cobellanez> Exactly kirzstryfe
<KaitoThePony> OH KAY
<kirzstryfe> 1,3~work compleet~
<Sundaysmile> Wrek's just playing blind because he's being pro
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:3
<KaitoThePony> Wut ease it?
<Snuffsis> Kammerjunk Well, sure it's not as pretty as newer games, but it's still quite pretty nonetheless. :P
<Snuffsis> Atleast in my opinion
<cow334> who is streaming
<Sundaysmile> Wrek
<The_Si> I don't know about you guys, but I'm enjoying these green squares.
*Jim can't wait for the GW2 beta in 4 hours
<Snuffsis> I'm enjoying the voices. :D
<pavarkian> iindeed
<EonMastor> bigger the square, the stronger it is
<kirzstryfe> 1,3me too Jim :)
<Commander_Shepard> Wrek is almost Wrex
<KaitoThePony> The_Si: lol
<pony_657677> Does anypony know this site? http://www.ponybin.net/
<Kammerjunk> Well, WC2 was released in 1995. I could probably have told you that it wouldn't give a donkey's flank about your streaming tools.
<Snuffsis> Jim, you know which server for the Bronystate guild?!
<Commander_Shepard> YES YES YES MY LORD
<The_Si> YES! YES! YES!
<Jim> Not sure
<Simon2> Am I the only one seeing the stream almost black?
<Saturn> 08,01
<Saturn> 08,01UUEERRRGGH
<Snuffsis> kirzstryfe Do you know which server bronystate is going on then? :P
<Kammerjunk> http://www.sadanduseless.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/8.jpg
<Ninjazz> UUUUUGHHHH
<The_Si> Get those red squares!
<cow334> what is going on
<EonMastor> most unseen epic battle ever
<kirzstryfe> 1,3let me pull up the list
<cow334> OH MY GOD HNNNNG
<KaitoThePony> this game makes no since
<The_Si> YES MI'LORD.
<Ninjazz> lol Kammerjunk
<Simon2> Is the stream completely black?
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes
<KaitoThePony> Yesh
<Sundaysmile> roighto
<Jim> It makes so sense because we can't see the details
<CrimsonPhoenix> and wrek cannot see chat
<Snuffsis> Simon2 Not completely black! :D
<derpy_pony> not sure if wrek has noticed that it doesn't stream properly
<EonMastor> no, there is some green and white in stream
<Jim> We also have boxes
<Ninjazz> I bet Wrek is really just trolling us.
<pavarkian> yeah, we're streaming a black panther rally
<Sundaysmile> Just watch the minimap
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I say we go with Eternal Grove for the GW2 world
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's full screen
<Snuffsis> kirzstryfe Sounds good, i'll get on there then. :D
<derpy_pony> wrek is too mature to troll anyone
<Sundaysmile> when the red bits appear, all hell breaks loose
<KaitoThePony> Like yesterday?

<Saturn> 08,01why do the knights sound liek a pre-pubescent Duke Nukem?

<UnFoundBug> Also, the GW2 login system is region tied, but the servers ARNT
<Kammerjunk> We are under a tack!
<Snuffsis> under a tack?
<Ninjazz> Man, these sounds get annoying if you can't see what the hell is going on.

<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: They showed somthing else mature.. it was metal somthing
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Jaketehsnake, what was the name of the map we played last night?
<lolol> Aw man pirating warcraft 2
<Wrek|Observing> 05actually no
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: We usually show anything other than ANY.mov and anything related to Cupcakes.
<Wrek|Observing> 05jsut gettign a NoCD installed
<lolol> o cool
<lolol> i wouldnt judge myou if you did pirate it, its a good dame
<Kammerjunk> Also hard to get legally these days.
<Kammerjunk> Tends to happen with 17 year old games.
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: I find it weird how when other people do stuff i do they get off the hook but when i type stuff like this i get "dont do that"
<lolol> Ninjazz: we do show the .movs, just not the shed.mov
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: Shit happens, man. Nothing we can do.
<Ninjazz> lolol: Did not know that.
<Ninjazz> Actually its up to the streamer.
<lolol> shed.mov isnt even that bad
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: is it just to the new bronies?
<lolol> magic.mov is the best .mov, HANDS DOWN
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: Not really.
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: Its just that it's not allowd in here.
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: i mean do people talk like that to the new bronies
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: Like what?
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: And are you a new brony?
<foxinator> what isn't allowed?
<Kammerjunk> Magic.
<Jim> *snort snort*
<lolol> mov is the best
<Ninjazz> nah.
<mitamaking> Good morning Bronies and whatever we call female fans
<foxinator> the .mov stuff?
<Jim> hai mitamaking
<Ninjazz> mitamaking, welcome.
<Cobellanez> Bronys
<Simon2> dat piratebay
<lolol> hi mitamaking
<lolol> we call them bronies
<Simon2> lolol: actually, pegasisters
<Ninjazz> INB4 THE FBI CLOSES DOWN BRONYSTATE D:
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: like yesterday a person asked for ponies and they gave us bad old ponies then i said "you should of said FIM!" then they said "don't do that" i was thinking thats what you ment!
<foxinator> i like pegasisters but they dont ;(
<lolol> Simon2: nope, that failed
<Simon2> lolol: how so?
<mitamaking> I thought they were working on something with filly in the name
<CrimsonPhoenix> hey guys did you know? http://i.dhne.ws/1327256602.jpg
<lolol> brony comes from /b/ro which is obligatory to gender, so brony is also obligatory
<foxinator> lol wc2 fail
<foxinator> still
<lolol> Wrek|Observing: it doesnt stream W2 properly
<Derpy_at_work> hai hai
<Simon2> omg chat ception again
<mitamaking> She was ChiChi too!!!!
<KaitoThePony> i think it just wont work
<Wrek|Observing> 05like i dont know
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: Ahhh. You must be new here. If you DEMAND ponies, you will be given ponies. Just not the kind you probably want. Just behave yourself, don't be rude, and just generally try to respect the authority of the mods.
<lolol> SOrry....
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wrek you would need to put wc2 in windows
<mitamaking> Seems Reboot shares a few voices with Fim, remember the Spike sighting in that one episode
<mitamaking> Demanding ponies leads to G3.5, don't demand ponies
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: i mean they siad "my little pony episode" and it just gets me mad when i do the same thing and a "user" not a mod tells me not to do that
<Derpy_at_work> hai hai
<pavarkian> >->
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: You have a name. Its easier to pick up on name instead of "pony_2839734021754098127".
<lolol> KaitoThePony: would you prefer a mod to tell you off?
<Ninjazz> Just take it as a way of being noticed.
<foxinator> wy demand even demand ponies?
<lolol> KaitoThePony: or a user to friendly warn you
<pavarkian> so, we just going to yell at the new guy?
<pony_283973402175409> my name now
<Kammerjunk> What new guy?
<Ninjazz> -_-
<Wrek|Observing> 05hey atleast there's good music
<pavarkian> newish guy
<foxinator> agreed
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: nah they just say "dont do that" and im like wut did i do
<Kammerjunk> I'm fairly certain I've seen KaitoThePony before.
*Ninjazz dances to Wrek's music
<pavarkian> bah, humbug
*lolol dances with Ninjazz
<pavarkian> I havent seen him, so hes new
<Kammerjunk> But it might just be the devil ether talking.
<pony_283973402175409> No stream or am I just not loading it
<KaitoThePony> Kammerjunk: yea you have yesterday night was my first day as a bronie
<Ninjazz> Well, learn what you did wrong, KaitoThePony. Take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes.
<Jim> Not sure if serious
<pony_283973402175409> There it is
<pavarkian> ikr Jim
<foxinator> a newer brony than me ...
<Kammerjunk> KaitoThePony: Right-o, then!
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: i don't think i did anything wrong i think the mod that was up liked to troll... (he kept showing justin beiber)
<lolol> Discussion time! Cheese and onion crisps vs salt and vinigar vs ready salted
<lolol> GO
<foxinator> hooza for for everyone that still is becoming one
<pavarkian> ive seen you around foxinator, or atleast i though ti had
<mitamaking> That name just isn't going to stick
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: I... What?
<Chezne> vinegar all the way
<foxinator> like since saterday
<pavarkian> hmm
<foxinator> was my first time here
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....no way
<pavarkian> i guess so
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: /
<lolol> KaitoThePony: dont... please...
<mitamaking> baby baby oh baby
<pavarkian> your name just seems familiar
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: Alright. I can probably explain that.
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: o30
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: Remember what I said about DEMANDING?
<PrincessDismo> http://i.imgur.com/NvqQs.png :'3
<mitamaking> Ninjazz: Some mods are weird
<cow334> sea ponys any one
<CrimsonPhoenix> GUYS
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/Cybersix.jpg This...is SPIKE

<Wrek|Observing> 05screw this
<pavarkian> good
<lolol> i dont think anyone in the world is weird#
<pavarkian> dont figure it out
<PrincessDismo> Jim: Me and SuperBrony64|Zzz Have been trying to get that shot of her without the HUB logo ;~;
<mitamaking> Where did the Scottalo is a chicken thing start? Pinkie was the chicken
<foxinator> he is screwing it O.o
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: If you DEMAND. You won't be given anything good or anything you will like. That is why you REQUEST. As silly as that sounds, just do it. It is basic common courtesy and respect.
*kirzstryfe glomps Ninjazz
<ZombieBrony> Sup bronystate
<pavarkian> hey ZombieBrony
<Jim> oh neat
*Ninjazz is glomped ^^
<Jim> ohai ZombieBrony
*mitamaking waves at ZombieBrony from a safe distance
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: i never demanded yesterday i just watched and learned and when i copied some things they did i get crap
<Simon2> O_O So much torrents
<Anotherguy> Hi everyone
<CrimsonPhoenix> we should watch Cybersix in here sometimes
<ZombieBrony> Thepiratebay?
<lolol> KaitoThePony: a long time ago, when i was a silly filly, i said"I demand poni" as a joke, then the mods played an episode of G3, tru story
*pavarkian contains ZombieBrony for study
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: Don't follow a stupid crowd.
<Wrek|Observing> 05atleast with the torrent it runs without a CD
<Simon2> ZombieBrony: eeyup
<Wrek|Observing> 05which will make the winforcer work
<mitamaking> G3 is worst pony
<Wrek|Observing> 05untill then
<pavarkian> tell that to g3.6
<Jim> G3,5 is worst pony
<ZombieBrony> G3.5 is worst pony
<kirzstryfe> 1,3you have to remember, nobody is getting paid to be here, all the staff and streamers do this when and because we want to, and we're still human so there are times when we may miss something
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: i don't think i demanded anything i think they started talking a bout ponies and i sais "that sounds cool"
<lolol> Jim: i agree
<ScootaChicken> Last night was fun, wasn't it.
<mitamaking> G3.5 is not even a pony
<ScootaChicken> Wait, no one in here actually remembers it
<Anotherguy> What's happening today?
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: then i got "you don't want to do that"
<ScootaChicken> except for possibly Phase4
<pavarkian> you guys are human?
<Simon2> kirzstryfe: what are the procedures of becoming a mod?
<foxinator> treamer gets paid.. a-it all goes to the server but still
<lolol> we dont like to talk about G3.5...
<pavarkian> i thought yu were an alien race of superbeings
<mitamaking> Movie night and looks like a Guild War 2 beta Anotherguy
<cow334> kirzstryfe: so basically you are hear cause you want to be here
<UnFoundBug> Simon2 long, ardious and not open for a long while
<foxinator> DOOM?
<pavarkian> dat grammar cow334
<thymine> anyone else heard Aviators - In Wonder?
<Phase4`> lets see.... what was last night again
<mitamaking> Doom to Pony music?
<cow334> pavarkian: lol im sorry
*Jim is super excited for the beta
<pavarkian> tis k
<Ninjazz> KaitoThePony: Listen... Don't dwell on this. Just move on. Just forget about it. The mods deal with alot of crap and they don't really have all the time in the world to single out every single innocent person. Just behave. Respect others. You'll do fine here.
<KaitoThePony> %kirzstryfe: and i luv u here too :) but i will get confused once in a while
<kirzstryfe> 1,3we say we're looking for mod, people send in apps, and we go from there, or you can send an email to bronystate@gmail.com saying you're interested in applying to become a mod (when we're not actively recruiting) and you may get a response
<ScootaChicken> I have lots of screencaps.
<ScootaChicken> But I'll give you a clue first.
<ScootaChicken> Last night was this: @pokemon
<Phase4`> oh yeah
<kirzstryfe> 1,3well, I'm here because they chained me to the wall again, but that's another story
<ScootaChicken> @pokemon
<Phase4`> steve spam
<Steven_Magnet> 12 ScootaChicken is a/an 2 Chingling
<Wrek|Observing> 05my computer hasnt been on my side today
<Jim> ooh, doom
<KaitoThePony> Ninjazz: k :)
<Ninjazz> ;)
<pavarkian> id be a mod, but... meh
<Anotherguy> The Dark Side
<ScootaChicken> But unlike usual Steve Magnet stuff in mane, it was actually fun here
<mitamaking> If I had stuff to show(and knew how to do it) I would apply, but people on here hate anime
<ScootaChicken> I dunno why
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I love the Aviators' music
<Simon2> kirzstryfe: Is the person who wanted to be a mod required to be active in chat?
<thymine> same
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a mod because i chained kirzstryfe to a wall
<foxinator> doom!! wooot
<pavarkian> nice Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01but that's another story
<Digitalis> :( I don't hate anime
<Jim> this is a really neat looking mod
<Simon2> ... Holy shit the visuals O_O
<derpy_pony> this is not the original shotgun
<Ninjazz> dat history...
<KaitoThePony> I like anime
<pavarkian> I could stream... I have enough stuff
<mitamaking> Just seems most people would rather not watch anime here
<Saturn> 08,01Jim: thank you; i try
<Jim> O U :3
<UnFoundBug> I applied to be a mod because I made Saturn chain kirzstryfe to a wall, but thats another story
<Digitalis> well then they don't have to watch
<UnFoundBug> :P
<pavarkian> I could get some bloody disney movies...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Simon2, it can help in the app process, just so people know you
*Jim glomps Saturn
<Ninjazz> Why are always chained to walls, kirzstryfe?

<flutter_spin> I didn't preorder GW2 so I won't be a part of that. My brother's lego project hit 10,000 so expect to see a review and watch it be published like Minecraft
<prince-dari> Hey Ninjazz. :>
<Ninjazz> :O
<flutter_spin> I have to go to work in about 3 hours.
<cow334> what is gw2 about

<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, welcome back, I assume.
<Invi> Moin Mean ^^

<ImOkayWithThis> Invi Okie dokie
<Ninjazz> :)
<ponybronypony> im back
<KaitoThePony> 0-0
<Light_Latias> 12Roara
<flutter_spin> Guild Wars 2 is very much like World of Warcraft, only there is no subscription. Its a onetime pay. Plus they have improved combat by reducing the important of the trinity (tank, dps, heal)
<cow334> flutter_spin: that is awsome ill make sure to bye it when i see it in stores man congruadlations
<Invi> ImOkayWithThis :)
<Snuffsis> I wonder if hilmar is ever going to get his Lego Rifter. :P
<Light_Latias> 12when you "get animated", you're supposed to go OUTSIDE D:
<flutter_spin> But if you REALLY want to know what made me want to play GW2....
*Light_Latias hides
<ImOkayWithThis> Invi i'll be hitting the books now
<Invi> flutter_spin are it bronies?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3GW is more skill based
<cow334> what is GW2
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Guild Wars 2
<Invi> ImOkayWithThis good luck :)
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUVLclPDCBE&list=PL11748A310ECB9063&index=32&feature=plpp_video First 30seconds of this film made me WANT ITTTTTT
<cow334> wait is that mean gundum wing 2 Kirakura
<Umbreon> XDDD
<Umbreon> silly Light_Latias
<Snuffsis> So, what happened when i'm gone, i see a lot of GW2 chat, server decided? :P
<Meanwhile> Press button to kill bad stuff, take loot. Repeat.
<rainbowdash002> guys before i buy guild wars 2 who is going to be playing
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile! How is Trixie doing?
<ghostpolitics> what class are you going to be first kirzstryfe
<cow334> flutter_spin: that games looka awsome
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I will be
<Dusky> 06!Umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to Dusky for 15 minutes
<Invi> rainbowdash002 there is actually a brony guild xD
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and Dragons are awesome
<Dusky> 06yush
<Umbreon> nooo
<Meanwhile> Unconcious in her wagon FlareChaser.
<cow334> kirzstryfe: what is it for
<Snuffsis> rainbowdash002 The ones i know here is Luna, kirzstryfe, Me, Jim and some other fellas. :P
<Umbreon> ;-;
<kirzstryfe> 1,3PC
*Dusky feeds Umbreon meat with QuacamolÃ©
<Ninjazz> I'm just not into huge MMOs.
<Umbreon> i hate guaramole
<Ninjazz> For some odd reason.
<rainbowdash002> what time u guys will be playing
<Umbreon> guatamole
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile: What? you do were doing stuff and she banged her head on something?
<Dusky> 06*guacamole
<kirzstryfe> 1,3MMOs are fun when you have people to play it with that don't suck
<Umbreon> LKSDJfdsaflksdafsa
<Espeon> 06!umbreonglow
*Umbreon still belongs to Dusky for 14 more minutes
<flutter_spin> Another cool thing is active quests while you attack. Less "get quest, do it"
<Umbreon> we both can't type it right
<Espeon> 06:<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
<Snuffsis> Yea, MMOs are the best when played with friends. <3
<Dusky> 06:P
<flutter_spin> Oh and bosses will scale depending on the number of players in the area
<FlareChaser> kirzstryfe: and thats how MMOs work.
<Ninjazz> I'm willing to give em a try, but then I get strangly bored.
<Airpuff> That.. is one.. big-ass dragon O.o And hi everypony =O
<Meanwhile> FlareChaser: Actually she's just really lazy on friday.
<rainbowdash002> i have the first one but did not play it much
<Cobellanez> Again, you are correct kirzstryfe
<flutter_spin> ^^ Airpuff
<Invi> Snuffsis join the EU brony guild of EU xD
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile: Really now? I wonder why...
<SlurryMoon> 3hey there :)
<SlurryMoon> 3What's going on?
<Meanwhile> Allo SlurryMoon.
<twilight_sprinkle> mmo's are fun when you play for fun, even if your team sucks
<cow334> kirzstryfe: so what is going to happend or like what is coming up with the game gw2 is there going to be like a big match for brony please tell me
<Invi> moin SlurryMoon
<Ninjazz> SlurryMoon, welcome.
<NightSeas> 02!Espeon
*Espeon now belongs to NightSeas for 15 minutes
<RX-78|FireEmblem> ohai slurry
<NightSeas> 02:3
<Snuffsis> Invi I will do that, i just don't know what server we're going for. T_T
<cow334> bronys
<Umbreon> o-O
<kirzstryfe> 1,3no trinity, you scale to the dungeons(no power levelling through dungeons), dodging means you actually have to dodge, skills matter more than having a screen full of buttons
<Airpuff> Damn.. made me wanna play Gw 2 T.T
<FlareChaser> brb
<Snuffsis> I'm going to play it in 2 hours, closed beta. <3
<Cobellanez> Hey SlurryMoon
<cow334> hello SlurryMoon
<Airpuff> =O Hai moon
<Meanwhile> I'll see whether GW2 is playing when WoW ends.
<Invi> Snuffsis we don't really know either xD http://royalnightguards.enjin.com/forum
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and best of all
<Meanwhile> Until then I remain invested in Azeroth.
<cow334> kirzstryfe: is the game going to be online or something with bronys
<kirzstryfe> 1,3you can JUMP!
<flutter_spin> There is some form of "hit me" / "I'll help you" / "I can restore health"
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:3
<NightSeas> 02!Cmds
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Rukario03)02WB* - <Umbreon> there really isn't anything hard about DOS <Umbreon> except making it do something useful
<flutter_spin> But it isn't ... that important
<Snuffsis> Invi Is that the official one for Bronystate guild? :O
<Ninjazz> Inb4 Jumping becomes OP and is removed
<KaitoThePony> brb
<Meanwhile> Ah yeah you can't jump in GW1 can you.
<Invi> Snuffsis no, apparently not :(
<Meanwhile> That was always really annoying for some reason.
<NightSeas> 02!Arcanine
*Arcanine still belongs to Xanbreon for 12 more minutes
<NightSeas> 02:<
<Umbreon> D:
<Umbreon> homework time
<Invi> Snuffsis but it already has 24 members ^^
<kirzstryfe> 1,3because there were zones where you'd get stuck on the terrain, early on at least
<dentidiot> hey guys
<Snuffsis> kirzstryfe It's not actually FULL dodging, there are some abilities that are seeking and some that is dodgable by just moving out of the way. :P
<flutter_spin> I cant wait to try out a mage. Switching between fire and ice on the fly would be cool
<alexxm> hey dentidot hows your day been
<dentidiot> whats streaming?
<Xanbreon> b0rk
<Xanbreon> x3
<flutter_spin> err.. elementalist? whatever that is
<Umbreon> i blame Xanbreon
<dentidiot> good thx
<Meanwhile> Rogue > everything.
<Invi> dentidiot: nothing ^^
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I'll be playing Ranger most likely, that was my class from GW1
<dentidiot> ok den
<Snuffsis> Ele/Necro was awesome in GW1 :D
<flutter_spin> Yeah. I loved Ranger in GW1
<UnFoundBug> Ill is there gonna be another one setup for the 2nd beta?
<Xanbreon> I blame me
<Xanbreon> !umbreon
<Xanbreon> !Umbreon
*Angel_Espeon claims all the eons >:/
<flutter_spin> The 8 ability setup kind of bugged me in GW1
<Snuffsis> I played Ele/Necro when it was op, impossible to kill because of insane HP regen and dmg. :P
<Xanbreon> Noes attack of the AE
<RX-78|FireEmblem> engineer for me :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I liked it, made choosing your abilities part of the strategy
<flutter_spin> I remember when it was 12 ability setup in the beta
<dentidiot> i just beat mighty switch force woo!
<Xanbreon> Imokwiththis.png
<Snuffsis> yea
*Espeon traps AE between all the eons.
<Umbreon> i don't think i have the umbreon script on this computer
<Xanbreon> AE eonwich
<Snuffsis> I liked it as well
<Umbreon> so sorry SXD
<Phase4> i has potentialy solved 503 problems
<FlareChaser> kirzstryfe: I think I might get GW2, I'm not sure, I'm still waiting for Pandas on WoW.
<Airpuff> Damn.. that dramatic music <.<
<Umbreon> you can own arcanine though
<Xanbreon> !arcanine
<Phase4> with that i sleep
*Arcanine still belongs to Xanbreon for 10 more minutes
<Phase4> gnight
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Pandas won't save WoW :p
<Xanbreon> :P
<dentidiot> bye

<Meanwhile> Night Phase4
<Airpuff> Oo Gn Phase =)
<Espeon> 06Fine too
<kirzstryfe> 1,3g'night Phase4 :)
<Angel_Espeon> 13Arcafloof
<Umbreon> powerfluff?
<UnFoundBug> G'night Phase4
<Xanbreon> fineness
<Meanwhile> kirzstryfe: Implying WoW needs saving.
<ImOkayWithThis> night Phase4
<Xanbreon> brbs
<Invi> Phase4 nighty ^^
<Umbreon> i don't know how i noticed this but i was so tired and out of it in school yesterday
<alexxm> cya Phase4
<Snuffsis> Pandas are awesome!
<Airpuff> WoW.. Its a great game.. but they have to uppgrade the graphics or something soon xD
<flutter_spin> My bro is still working with Eve Online in releasing that lego project. Then we will probably spend a month or two on Old Republic. Then I'll switch to GW2. I don't like to be part of that initial wave of people
<Ninjazz> Gnight Phase4 gone
<Umbreon> that i typed power and thought to myself "....all those keys were in the top tow"
<Umbreon> *row
<Meanwhile> What is this place filled with so many pandas.
<alexxm> and tasty Snuffis
<Snuffsis> Do not eat pandas
<Ninjazz> Chine.
<FlareChaser> Airpuff: Thats what theyre doing.
<Ninjazz> China*
<FlareChaser> kirzstryfe: Who said WoW was dying?

<Snuffsis> Invi, are you going on for the GW2 beta in <2 hours?

<cow334> kirzstryfe: oh okay thank you any thing special do like an online commuinty or nothing
<UnFoundBug> or so iv heard
<Ninjazz> Wait, whoa whoa whoa... No Monthly Fee?
<Umbreon> let me plot

<Ninjazz> No Monthly Fee?
<cow334> Invi: how many players online are you going to get it
<Invi> Snuffsis no :( bu I'yy buy it if it releases here
<Snuffsis> Yea, but it's only items that make you look pretty, nothing that will make you better. :P
<alexxm> lol Sketch_Toku_Pony
<UnFoundBug> Yeah, same as the first one
<flutter_spin> ... no monthly fee. That is what makes in awesome
<Umbreon> i can hold off on DOS homework, i think we are going over it in class anyway
<Invi> cow334 too many xD
<Ninjazz> I am suddenly interested.
<Snuffsis> Invi Aww shucks.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the good thing about the micro transactions is they've said it will not affect the core gameplay to give you an advantage over others
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i know right!? :D
<Meanwhile> No monthly fee, that is what makes you all look like the homeless.
<Umbreon> written communication i need to wait till i get feedback from the writing center
<Invi> Snuffsis ik :(
<Airpuff> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Omg xDD That is priceless
<FlareChaser> WoW is 30 bucks for 2 months. People: ITSSOEXPENSIVEHUURRRG
<UnFoundBug> ah so its all cosmetic? very nice
<Umbreon> help desk it is
<cow334> Invi: how much would you say like how many players online can be in one match
<FlareChaser> Dat Derp.
<alexxm> lol Sketch_Toku_Brony
<flutter_spin> Meanwhile: When you only make 12k a year, come back and tell me that
<UnFoundBug> i actually tend to spend more on cosmetic-only microtransactions
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol homework, procrastination FTW
<Invi> cow334 about 1000?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol i know! :D
<Meanwhile> flutter_spin: I personally don't even make that.
<rainbowdash002> thats how much i make a yr
<alexxm> which countru will we take over first
<cow334> Invi: HOLY SH-- that is a lot are you going to get theb game
<KaitoThePony> back
<Saigneur> guys, i need your help, i want the last song of ArchieV : love is in bloom, but his youtube account is closed, anypony have download it ???
<Invi> cow334 the MM in MMO stands for Massively Multyplayer ^^
<foxinator> wdup bonies
<dentidiot> i kinda hate free to play games because if you dont pay for items it gets boring and repetitive
<FlareChaser> I feel awkward talking about this.
<cow334> Invi: oh okay thank you
<KaitoThePony> why is the game paused
<Invi> cow334 the o stands for online xD
<Snuffsis> Saigneur i have ti downloaded, want me to send it to you over irc?
<FlareChaser> Too much white text.
<alexxm> about what FlareChaser
<cow334> Invi: oh okay
<Meanwhile> The full stop stands for a full stop
<Ninjazz> Wrek went out to grab some food.
<Snuffsis> That is if you got a standalone irc client. :P
<Umbreon> i'm trying to prioritize by when my next class comes so XD
<flutter_spin> Its just bonus points. It is like a car salesman saying that the car has higher gas mileage. It barely makes a dent, but hey everything counts

<cow334> helllo Digit|ArtMode
<Meanwhile> WoW doesn't die. It's like Cthulhu.
<flutter_spin> swtor is hurting big time, not from the game perspective, but because how the company is working with it.
<Xanbreon> uderp
<Cobellanez> bronystate guild where?
<FlareChaser> kirzstryfe: Bronystate guid, where GW2?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and SWTOR was never going to kkill WoW, it's far too similar
<Digit|ArtMode> Hi ^^
<foxinator> dont say wow
<foxinator> plz dont say wow
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Bronystate guild in GW2, yes
<Umbreon> Xanbreon was buried alive :D
<foxinator> woot
<dentidiot> was SWTOR any good?
<Cobellanez> HMM
<Meanwhile> Implying most MMO's aren't similar at the core.

<dentidiot> :)
<Anotherguy> Is the stream working?
