<Trollestia> Ragnano: Get over it.
<ThatOnePony> Well, I better change too
<cowvarkian> RainbowAsh: exposition
<cowvarkian> foreshadowing
<Trollestia> Kencolt: HAHA, that's hilarious and something Alton Brown sounds like he would do
<pony_3045> for now it's UTC+4 and now they want do UTC+3, but not sure cus they idiots
<Combustiblelemons> is meanwhile here today?
<Meanwhile> Combustiblelemons: <3
<Jageman> What idiot let him do this to their kid?
<Combustiblelemons> :3
<Alchemist> raptors are terrorist commandos
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], I believe that. Just saying, even if it was possible (which I very much doubt), 30k won't get you anywhere
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Personally I dont have an issue with gays, people need to leave them alone
<Ragnano> Trollestia: so it are ramen from the brand JapeLuna?
<Combustiblelemons> nice to see you meanwhile :D
<Stellafera> Urg, I'm so much of a fan of animation that I forget how mumbly people sound in live action
<Lindeman> 30,000k I guess if so
<Kandarihu> Gaydars aren't very accurate. They return false positives too much.
<Meanwhile> And you Combustible. How's it going?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> RainbowAsh: Apperently it had a 80% success rate
<Angeling> mmm starting some early psychological trauma for t he kids
<RainbowAsh> cowvarkian, it would make more sense if he told it to his imaginary friend.
<TwilightArcanum> They let him do it cause it's Sam Neil <.< I love that guy
<Steibr13> :'( okay
<Kencolt> Trollestia: He did. He used it again to explain how to cut up a chicken.
<Trollestia> Ragnano: Nailed it. Enjoy them moonrocks, I've heard it adds a cheesy flavor.
<cowvarkian> RainbowAsh: yeah
<LordDerpington> Luna will be in his dreams tonight
<Trollestia> Kencolt: That's Hilarious.
<Cajun> Ya know, for kids
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], what did they do? Create a questionaire where they asked "Are you gay?"
<Michael> lawl
<Lindeman> I hope Luna will be in my
<PONY> BLAME ALL DEM KIDS!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Ragnano: Your name keeps making me think of Ragnaros from WoW
<Alchemist> LordDerpington: careful
<CriticKitten> They do smell.
<Ragnano> LordDerpington: yes, with a wierd voice
*pony_3045 applejack hate kids face
<Stellafera> ?
<Trollestia> LordDerpington: He'll, uh, uhm, she'll be stuttering, um, yeah.
<ekips> what an asshole pilot
<Combustiblelemons> dat ass
<Ragnano> SpadeKyurem[R]: that could be because that's the name my name is based off xD
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<LordDerpington> I emptied your fridge
<Trollestia> LordDerpington: I made that joke last night :D
<Lindeman> KFC guy
<alexxm> old man steals your food
<LordDerpington> Too obvious?
<Saigneur> hey everypony
<Michael> hey saig
<Lindeman> Howdy
<pony_3045> it's a Gabe
<alexxm> how are things Saigneur
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Saigneur.
<Kotano> hi Saigneur
<Trollestia> LordDerpington: Nah, no one payed attention to mine :D
<Ragnano> Saigneur: hi
<Zohrd> Hi Saigneur.
<Combustiblelemons> i don't get a welcome? :(
<Michael> Saigneur*
<princess-loveles> :3
<cowvarkian> inb4 newman
<thelonevelociraptor> better
<pony_3045> yeup
<Stellafera> Hi Combustiblelemons!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> AJIsAwesome: I just found out something weird last night
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Anaruski> that seems like a big ass rv...
<AJIsAwesome> What, SpadeKyurem[R]?
<prince-dari> Spared no expense
<Lindeman> BRB, getting food
<jcelios> Combustiblelemons: WEEEEEEEEEEEEEELCOME STRANGA!
<J_E_Smith71> Did it just go to the slide show for everyone else?
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Ragnano> hi Combustiblelemons :)
<Fluffasaurus_Rex> I can't think of a good dinosaur name so I went the lazy man's route
<CriticKitten> Bronystate, spared no expense.
<Michael> hai Combustiblelemons !
<ekips> Get the expenses! Spare none!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> AJIsAwesome: Apperently the voice for Axel voiced Silver in Generations and Shadow in Gens was Saix
<Kotano> hi Combustiblelemons
<Combustiblelemons> :3 that's better
<Fluffasaurus_Rex> Whoever heard of a fluffy T-Rex?
<J_E_Smith71> Guess it was just me
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], maybe they are doing something like functional magnet ressonance scan or skin resistance and looked for telltale signs of arousal when they presented the subjects with naked men or something.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeKyurem[R]: Huh. I didn't know that.
<jcelios> wait wat
<jcelios> testing teh gay?
<Saigneur> hi alexxm , i'm fine, hey AJIsAwesome , hey Kotano , hey Ragnano , hey rohr, hey Michael
<Stellafera> Random glue
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], but radar implies that it should work over distance and passive, but I don't see how that could work
<thelonevelociraptor> not me, but you're the first one :O
<Trollestia> Saigneur: I once made a gigantic list of names... It took me 10 minutes, and I got half of the list. I got told not to name spam haha
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I dont really see whats so "wrong" about gays, sure it isnt "natural" but if that makes them happy, I don't care
<Lindeman> Back
<Combustiblelemons> dat bribery
<prince-dari> I dunno about the gaydar
<Trollestia> SpadeKyurem[R]: Good on you bro! I'm bisexual, that's awesome.
<ekips> SpadeKyurem[R] what is "natural" anyway?
<Angeling> nothing like some bags of money to grease the wheels
<pony_3045> lol
<Combustiblelemons> why hello thar dari.
<prince-dari> But I have heard the US army tried to develop a 'gay bomb'
<alexxm> money makes everything bette
<cowvarkian> SpadeKyurem[R]: are we on this covnersation now?
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], there are gay animals all over the place, so its as natural is it comes.
<Zohrd> A gay bomb? lolwut
<CriticKitten> Dari: AMERICA
<Combustiblelemons> i thought that's why there's HIV
<SpadeKyurem[R]> ekips: when they say natural they mean right in their eyes
<Vordox> prince-dari: "The big fat" "Long John"?
<SilentSword> cowvarkian: if we are im staying out of it XD
<prince-dari> They launch it at enemy lines to make all their soldiers stop fighting and start loving it up instead.
<Lindeman> O bomb full of gay people?
<princess-loveles> i missed the episode but its already on youtube
<Alchemist> prince-dari: did it say he-LLOOOOO when it fell?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Its apperently unatural for a man or woman to be with the same sex
<Jageman> There are some genetic markers that seem to increase the chance of an individual being homosexual
<Michael> gaben
<Trollestia> FAT FUCK
<Deadlypon3> A hormone
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: that sounds fun
<Combustiblelemons> damn a sexbomb.
<Sundaysmile> It explodes and makes everyong fabulous
<Deadlypon3> Its just a hormonial bomb
<cowvarkian> SpadeKyurem[R]: thats utter crap
<Kandarihu> RainbowAsh, no there aren't.
<Trollestia> FAAAAT FUUUUUCK
<LordDerpington> Combustiblelemons: Nah. It was SIV that made the leap to humans through the consumption of chimpanzee meat, probably.
<Combustiblelemons> sexbomb, sexbomb, you're my sexbomb ^_^
<LordDerpington> DODGSON ALERT!
<Deadlypon3> ...Thanks yah fat fuck :p
<Trollestia> See nobody cares
<pony_3045> i gotta love gay bomb c: no homo
<Combustiblelemons> or chimpanzee rape LordDerpington
<Haku1013> nyeh
<Blazing_Beatz> the fat man....hes so stupid
<princess-loveles> ''ihihihihihi''
<Kencolt> SpadeKyurem[R]: It is somewhat counterintuitive from a biological standpoint, since the natural impulse of all life is to reproduce.
<Combustiblelemons> i hate this fatass
<Zohrd> Is that Gabe?
<Deadlypon3> XD
<Zohrd> I bet he is.
<ekips> I know someone who should get hit by a gay bomb :3
<pony_4908> XD
<pony_3045> inb4 Gaben
<SilentSword> he squeed
<Combustiblelemons> gabe newell is awesome, don't disrespect him.
<TrixieMuffin> So his investors will care about the opinion of the expert thats on Hammonds payroll ? And he hasa gift with people ..... like this guy!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Kencolt: But the thing is, not everyone has to do that
<RainbowAsh> Kandarihu, I think observations on several hundred species of mammals and birds might disagree with your notion.
<Michael> HL3 in that bagg
<Haku1013> 18 minutes
<cowvarkian> RainbowAsh: ikr
<Haku1013> Nyeh
<Combustiblelemons> Hl3 for 2013
<Haku1013> Haku has appeared
<Deadlypon3> ...Hammond's mistake?
<princess-loveles> $
<Haku1013> Bow down
<Fluffasaurus_Rex> Plushies don't count
<Deadlypon3> Spared no expense my ass
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Half life 3 for 3016
<Haku1013> TO MY INFINITE GLORY
<Stellafera> Suddenly epic music
<Deadlypon3> Oh here we go
<thelonevelociraptor> ohai Haku1013
<Michael> choppa
<cowvarkian> und dann goldblum
*thelonevelociraptor bows down to Haku1013
<Deadlypon3> Ooh hahahah OOooo Hahhaha
<Combustiblelemons> not a fan of Geoff Goldblum :s
<FlaschenJoe11> Jeff Goldbloom, the living walking and talking stereotype.
<Combustiblelemons> or is it jeff... lol
<Kencolt> SpadeKyurem[R]: It's merely I have heard a few gays activists insist that it's genetic. You'll have to admit, that's a gene that wouldn't be passed on easily. Thus, it must be more a psychologica/socological factor. I make no judgements, I speak merely from science.
<Haku1013> thelonevelociraptor? Are we dinosaurs now?
*Haku1013 rawr
<thelonevelociraptor> if you want
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Every time I hear shit like this Gaydar, I ask why are we wasting money on this crap?
<thelonevelociraptor> :3
<Stellafera> Aww, it's no fun looking for random background events when it's just plain ocean
<Combustiblelemons> >movie about dinosaurs
<princess-loveles> there!!!!!!
<Kandarihu> RainbowAsh, if it's done with a broken scientific process intended exclusively to "prove" homosexuality to be natural and throwing out any evidence that contradicts the narrative, we can't call it science. That's what happened with that whole "gay gene" debacle.
<ekips> Kencolt well, it "could" be a genetic disorder that is accidental?
<Lindeman> Howdy everydino!
<Combustiblelemons> >convo about gay people
<prince-dari> I uh, think that uh Hammon's ability to uh know people hasn't worked f-f-for him with uh Nedry
<Deadlypon3> Kencolt it doesn'tactually make you 'gay' it just increases the hormones in the soldiers to the point that they want to stop fighting and just have sex with the nearest person
<Michael> epic soundtrack
<Ta_Dikin> welcome to executive bathroom island!!!!!
<Punkie_Pue> ^
<Punkie_Pue> haha
<Lindeman> Oh god
<Zohrd> what the hell
<Zohrd> haha
<T-Rex1013> thelonevelociraptor RAWR
<Angeling> lol
<princess-loveles> .~.
<pony_3045> gay detector
<Deadlypon3> prince-dari they gonna prairie dog it out the window?
<Saigneur> this movie is cultissime
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Why do people spend money on pointless shit and it gets approved?
<thelonevelociraptor> T-Rex1013: rawr >:3
<Trollestia> thelonevelociraptor: Hey, are you thelonepony?
<pony_4908> Whether or not homosexuality can be traced to a gene, what does it really matter, beyond the realm of scientific interest?...
<Jageman> Kencolt: i have read that a gene that encurages females to actively reproduce with males can sometimes work their way into the males of the same family
<thelonevelociraptor> Trollestia: No <_<
<Anaruski> when did this discussion turn to the "weapons of mass sexuality"?
<Combustiblelemons> ikr
<alexxm> yahoo
<Combustiblelemons> dari said something about it
<Lindeman> PEHNIS!
<Combustiblelemons> blame him
<pony_3045> best music ever!
<T-Rex1013> Anaruski when wasnt it?
<Trollestia> thelonevelociraptor: I should be the lone pony then >:D
<Deadlypon3> Anaruski when we say so!
<VenHur> ...Rawr.
<AJIsAwesome> Combustiblelemons: We've had ponies played before and we had a discussion about politics.
<DRHUnleashed> Anaruski :D
<Combustiblelemons> she wants the D.
<princess-loveles> o.0
<T-Rex1013> VenHur must become a dinosaur
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: fun times
<thelonevelociraptor> thelonepony: D:
<thelonepony> thelonevelociraptor: Hey, lookit me
<SilentSword> AJIsAwesome: true
<princess-loveles> no get in water :U
<Stellafera> And this is why soundtrack composers should be more respected
<Deadlypon3> Pink shirt day :D
<Combustiblelemons> the politics of equestria AJIsAwesome
*Michael noms on thelonevelociraptor tail
<Blazing_Beatz> Our 8th grade ban played that theme....sorta
<Sundaysmile> real men just hold onto something
<Kencolt> And all of those, again, are genetic flaws-- and thus wouldn't survive long by simple laws of evolution. No, I have to go with a sociological/environmental aspect.
<Deadlypon3> Look at that Pink SHIRT
<Combustiblelemons> entirely relevant.
<Blazing_Beatz> *8th grade band
<AJIsAwesome> Combustiblelemons: No. Real life politics.
<Zohrd> Awkward silence
<ZZZ> :|
<Sundaysmile> usually the rotor blades
<Ta_Dikin> To the roflolcopter
<LordDerpington> Stellafera: John Williams is worthy of much respect.
<T-Rex1013> EXECUTIVE BATHROOM ISLAND
<pony_3045> i really never understand what morale in this movie
<pony_3045> like
<Kandarihu> pony_4908, the gay lobby is trying to argue that homosexuality is natural so that any criticisms of the lifestyle can be flagged as racism.
<thelonevelociraptor> Trollestia: oh you :3
<Stellafera> Indeed
<Stellafera> I mean on the John Williams
<Combustiblelemons> i don't remember that then :P
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: I'm fine with that
<Trollestia> thelonevelociraptor: Oh, you! :3
<Ta_Dikin> Peter Griffin: Well this is peacefull.
<cowvarkian> not really racism though, just bigotry
<Michael> so much security
<VenHur> Raaawr...
<Jageman> Kencolt: those genes have been proven to exist
<TwilightArcanum> I thought th moral of this movie was don't make dinosaurs
*thelonevelociraptor noms on Trollestia :3
<pony_3045> then you build a giant park you need better security system and responsable emplyee
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Again if people are happy being with the same sex, It's not my right to decide how they live
<FlaschenJoe11> I can't think of a [relevant thing]Joe11 name for this movie!!
<T-Rex1013> pony_3045 the morale is that dinosaurs are fucking awesome but you shouldnt clone them unless you know that the island is a prime target for hurricane
*thelonevelociraptor noms on Fluffasaurus_Rex >:3
<pony_4908> kandarihu: Well, shouldn't any excessive hate be taken care of accordingly anyhow? I mean, given fair warning and all.
<Trollestia> thelonevelociraptor: No! You've gobbled my backside!
<princess-loveles> molesia
<pony_3045> T-Rex1013, ikr :D
<Blazing_Beatz> All this security, and the Dinosaurs still break all hell loose
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, well I'm not fine with it. I'm tired of being called racist just for being white.
<Stellafera> LAWN MOWERS
<Buytoast> DinoJoe11
<thelonevelociraptor> D:
<Buytoast> there
<Trollestia> Blazing_Beatz: It was like airport security before 2001
<SpadeKyurem[R]> WHAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS!
<thelonevelociraptor> i'm sorry ;^;
<ChaosTheorySurge> Fluffasaurus_Rex: well feathered dinos were fluffy :D
<princess-loveles> rawr
<Buytoast> and what the hell is going on in the main chat
<ekips> Blazing_Beatz dat spoiler
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu you're probably called racist because you're racist.
<Jageman> Won't the lawyer be dead in 48 hours?
<VenHur> A meteorite.
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: though you can't really be racist against a sexuality. thats not how race works
<FlaschenJoe11> SpadeKyurem[R]: THE ICE AGE!!!!!
<Michael> incoming meme
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: that too
<Trollestia> thelonevelociraptor: Haha, sokay. I needed to lose some weight
<Combustiblelemons> Blazing_Beatz: life uh... it uh... finds a way.
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, I am NOT RACIST!
<Sundaysmile> dat reacotion shot
<pony_4908> I love how they didn't notice the disnosaurs until just now.
<T-Rex1013> pony_3045 If anything they should have the dinosaurs less smart, and dometicated them so we can have pet dinos
<Angeling> ITS A COW!!!
<Sundaysmile> reaction*
<thelonevelociraptor> Buytoast: randomness, stupidity etc
<Michael> mother of god
<princess-loveles> :[ rawr
<CriticKitten> Except that it is natural, it does exist, and why do you care how other people live? Seriously, believe what you want, but keep judgment to yourself.
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: You strike me as a bit racist.
<thelonevelociraptor> like always
<Zohrd> Raping time?
<WhatTheDerp-> THEY SEE US
<Trollestia> Kandarihu: I read that as meanwhile, I am not a racist.
<WhatTheDerp-> RETREAT
<Kencolt> Jageman: No, they haven't. They have been suggested, even pointed to-- in the opinion of certain resrachers-- but they have yet to be proven. Even if they do, they are counter-reproduction, and thus should by logic die out in time-- or at least me in a much smaller minority than the actual percentage claimed.
<WhatTheDerp-> RETREAT
<Stellafera> Meteorite plus lava covering about a third of India
<Fluffasaurus_Rex> FlaschenJoe11: PterodacJoe11?
<pony_4908> Dat Spielberg face :D
<AJIsAwesome> Alright guys, let's calm down.
<DinoJoe11> thanks Buytoast
<Combustiblelemons> mother of god.
<Ta_Dikin> Your failure to recognize a universal morality does not make it dissapear!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Why the fuck did they build a park full of deadly dinosaurs, WITH NO METHOD TO KILL SAID DINOS
<Lindeman> :P
<VenHur> INCOMING TACTICAL GROUNDBREAKING CGI!
<Punkie_Pue> I thought the leaf was more interesting.
<T-Rex1013> This is the movie that made dinosaurs cool again.
*Bronysith protects Buytoast from mane chat
<Trollestia> Meanwhile, Kandarihu stop being rude to each other
<Fluffasaurus_Rex> lol nevermind
<Sundaysmile> the same reaction when we see a new ep on stream
<Saigneur> i am a stegausaurus !!!!!
<Angeling> we really should stop pumping hormones into cows..
<DinoJoe11> But Fluffasaurus_Rex has a better one
<cowvarkian> SpadeKyurem[R]: they have shot guns
*Bronysith gives Buytoast a mane chat hunting gun
<Alchemist> dat music
<Trollestia> T-Rex1013: When were dinosaurs NOT cool bro?
<Azuredragon> YOU DONT SAY
<SpadeKyurem[R]> That cant kill a T rex!
<thelonevelociraptor> D:
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], because the theme of the movie is "What has science done!?"
<Combustiblelemons> SpadeKyurem[R]: a weapons locker full of shotguns and assault rifles?
<Ragnano> Angeling; well, about that...
<LordDerpington> SpadeKyurem[R]: They did have a method to kill the dinos - they mention it in the story. They need a supplement of lysine or they die.
<Trollestia> ITS A DINOSAUR, HOLY FUUCK, WHAT THE SHIIIIT
<pony_3045> I want a dinopet!
<AJIsAwesome> Let's not be at each other's throats, alright?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> RainbowAsh: Now Im thinking of Doctor Weird
<Saigneur> it works, my timemachine works ! BAM, I AM A STEGOSAURUS
<pony_4908> Trollestia: When that meteorite heated up the earth and killed them off?
<Cajun> How far should science go is a little closer
<pony_4908> :D
<Michael> brachiosaurus...
<Saigneur> ok
<Stellafera> STEP
<Saigneur> anyway
<Trollestia> pony_4908: Gah
<princess-loveles> stomp
<Stellafera> Yay?
<Ragnano> pow!
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: It's because it's a recessive gene.
<Kandarihu> ...my last honorban was 72 hours and it was for three offenses.
<Saigneur> gaaaaaak
<Stallion_of_War> I think he's going to start crying or something
<TwilightArcanum> In the book by Michael Crichton they didn't have any shotguns but they did have one Rocket launcher
<SpadeKyurem[R]> GENTLEMEN, BEHOLD! DINOSAURS!
<Trollestia> pony_4908: Are you pun pony?
<Blazing_Beatz> See...Our Band Tried at playing this Jurassic Park theme...buuuuut we failed because its really hard to play
<Kandarihu> Trollestia, I didn't mean to be rude to him.
<Cajun> And then gravity happened
<Michael> dat sysmic movement
<pony_3045> I'm a Stegosaurus! :D
<VenHur> Better CGI than Twilight.
<Combustiblelemons> ohshi-
<pony_4908> Trollestia: Sometimes.
<Blazing_Beatz> and because we wree in 8th grade
<Ta_Dikin> Brocollisaurse
<Michael> t-rex?
<LordDerpington> We have a T-rex!
<T-Rex1013> Trollestia before this. Not many people really liked them becaue the only cool dinosaurs were in books. Sure, dino-films existed before this, but they never made dinos cool. Then this film came out and everyone was "I always thought that Dinosaurs were cool, hurr deur"
<Bogy> oh man i missed 20 minutes :(
<Trollestia> Blazing_Beatz: Did someone start singing jesus christ what the fuck?
<spypengen> I'm a pengen
<PterodacJoe11> T-Rex is my fav Dino
<Sundaysmile> sexual tyrannosaurus
<Stellafera> And you know the rex of the story
<Azuredragon> We have a Hulk
<Ta_Dikin> welcome to executive bathroom island
*T-Rex1013 can run at 33 mph
<Kandarihu> However, what he accused me of is a VERY VERY VERY serious charge.
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: Recessive genes don't show in every single person who has those genes. You're choosing to misinterpret how genes work so you can pretend that genetics can't possibly be a factor.
<VenHur> Rawr.
<BlitzWing00> Is it sad I used to think the dinosaurs looked so real? LOL
<princess-loveles> spider man
<Trollestia> T-Rex1013: Oh, well, there is ALWAYS godzilla
<Stellafera> I loved the version of this on the kazoo
<Combustiblelemons> But tyrannosauruses are from the cretacious period!
<SilentSword> Azuredragon: we have a t-rex
<Ta_Dikin> welcome to executive bathroom island
<Combustiblelemons> *snort*
<Anaruski> we have a t-rex. "nerdgasm"...
<Michael> what is a t-rex?
<Stallion_of_War> WELCOME, TO KENTUCKY FRIED DINOS!
<Cajun> I'd personally be more terrified than excited...
*ZZZ is wondering how the creators of Jurassic park got a stegasoarus
<pony_3045> dat dinos wannabe Stegosaurus
<Bogy> epic
<Blazing_Beatz> Trollestia: No, we was just an 8th grade school band, and failed at keeping the beat
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Science isnt evil or good
<Bogy> just awesome
<Meanwhile> Combustiblelemons: Don't rain on my jurassic parade.
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: Recessive doesn't explain the claimed percentages of the population-- which, by the way, is also disputed. I am merely saying that much of what is being called "fact" is far from proven and is counterintuitive.
<Combustiblelemons> Cretacious park doesn't sound as good i guess.
<Bogy> the music <3
<princess-loveles> holy what this shit its a dinosaur :0
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Science changes on who uses it
<pony_4908> ZZZ: This was a big-budget movie. :P
<Trollestia> Blazing_Beatz: I remember my 8th grade band. I think EVERYONE had one.
<Stallion_of_War> Why is Colonel Sanders breeding dinosaurs?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Its neutral mostly
<princess-loveles> what the fuuuuck ~
<Saigneur> bogy agreed , the music is awesome
<Meanwhile> Stallion_of_War: Ran out of chicken.
<PterodacJoe11> Stallion_of_War: Boredom?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> HOLY FUCKING SHIT
<Lindeman> "Excuse me mam, can I rape you with this stick?"
<Combustiblelemons> Meanwhile: i apologize for my parade raining.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> ITS A DINOSAUR
<Trollestia> Stallion_of_War: For his finger-lickin' good chicken, of course!
<Jageman> Kencolt: in genetics, almost nothing is proven 100% true, but there is sufficent evidence that those genes do affect sexuality
<T-Rex1013> Trollestia Godzilla was a mutated Dinosaur/Creature that existed before dinosaurs/some other origin explanation that the film series said.
<Alchemist> there is only logically sound and fallacious science. good and evil science doesnt exist.
<Kujo_Jojo> Stallion_of_War more meat
<Trollestia> T-Rex1013: JUST KEEP PROVING ME WRONG WHY DON'T YOU
<Michael> mericaa
<T-Rex1013> Trollestia I know my Godzilla
<Blazing_Beatz> Trollestia: Yeah I think so too. We was a good band, got first in a few things. T'was fun
<Jageman> Kencolt: the exist in mutliple species as well
<Kandarihu> So if pleading innocent to these charges are rude, then I can only plead guilty, and face all the consequenses.
<RainbowAsh> Kencolt, if there are several sequences involved, any percentage can be explained perfectly well
<Trollestia> Blazing_Beatz: Haha, I'm glad you had fun :)
<Stellafera> Looks like the museum of natural history
<cowvarkian> there are gay giraffes, arent there
<princess-loveles> nomnomnom
<T-Rex1013> THATS ME
<Kencolt> Jageman: Perhaps. But I can't think to the extreme that most activists claim. No, I still stand by a sociological and evnironmental stance-- nothing wrong with that.
<T-Rex1013> RAWR
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Wheres Crow?
<prince-dari> Kandarihu: What are you talking about...?
<Lindeman> Are we still talking bout this?
<pony_3045> I know why Jurrasic Park failed! They just need a Freeman in it
<WhatTheDerp-> oh. this part. ._.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Or Tom, or Joel to make fun of the movies
<ZZZ> dat ad
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, apparently, I'm a racist.
<Michael> dem 4th wall
<VenHur> A movie within a movie...Ya'll know what I'm sayin', dawg?
<pony_4908> Hello
<cowvarkian> Kencolt: but aren't there gay giraffes?
<Jageman> Kencolt: epigenetics could also be a factor
<Fluffasaurus_Rex> Going out, be baack later
<Meanwhile> Dem lines.
<Kencolt> RainbowAsh: True, but to many people are less trying to explain and more explain away.
<prince-dari> Meanwhile is probably trolling you
<Fluffasaurus_Rex> Going out, be backlater
<pony_3045> yay
<Azuredragon> TOO MANY JOHNS!
<Ragnano> dat 4th wall!
<pony_4908> Too many Johns
<WhatTheDerp-> CHANGELINGS.
<pony_3045> SCIENCE FOR ASSHOLES
<Stellafera> Applejohn
<princess-loveles> .~.
<Kencolt> cowvarkian: That seems to be more dominance behavior.
<Punkie_Pue> lol
<Meanwhile> dari: Not really, he's pretty racist.
<Combustiblelemons> meanwhile is known for that
<Trollestia> SO MANY JOHNS
<SpadeKyurem[R]> THE DREAM IS COLLAPSING
<Angeling> sausage fest!
<ZZZ> el flabador lol
<Combustiblelemons> hehe
<Ragnano> pinkie! that's your fault!
<Saigneur> too many john pi
<Blazing_Beatz> This Island was WAY before Apperature's time!
<pony_4908> Ping
<Deadlypon3> Mr. Dna
<Trollestia> SpadeKyurem[R]: WE NEED TO GO DEEPER
<Stallion_of_War> How did you make dinosaurs? WE BUCKED WITH SCIENCE!
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: Actually, recessiveness does explain it. I don't deny that some might "fake it", but to deny it as a factor is to effectively deny evidence that doesn't suit your narrative.
<WhatTheDerp-> oh god this.
<Stellafera> AHH
<WhatTheDerp-> the cartoon thingy
<Trollestia> Fuckin' Mr. DNA
<Sundaysmile> braeburn!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Can I ask why anyone THOUGH MAKING A PARK FULL OF GIANT DINOSAURS A GOOD IDEA?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> *Thought
<Kencolt> And here's more interesting DNA anyhow.
<Deadlypon3> DInersauaars
<pony_3045> DERPY SCIENCE 6_9
<pony_4908> DAHNO-SAWRS :P
<Meanwhile> Dinasores.
<Ragnano> so realistic dnas!
<Stallion_of_War> SpadeKyurem[R]: Money
<Ta_Dikin> :P
<T-Rex1013> FUN FACT: A single DNA strand is 6 feet long
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeKyurem[R]: For teh lulz?
<CriticKitten> DYENOSAWRS
<pony_3045> 9_6
<Kandarihu> SpadeKyurem[R], robots are too fake.
<Deadlypon3> Dinasaurs who run a diner :D
<Combustiblelemons> the animation style reminds me of superjail
<pony_3045> :P
<Blazing_Beatz> SpadeKyurem[R]: Because, SCIENCE
<CriticKitten> I love that accent.
<pony_3045> lol
<MrDNA> I am Mr. DNA, ask me anything.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Kypyrak!
<Deadlypon3> Dina saurs that run a diner
<Kotano> daanosaaar
<Zohrd> minecraft
<Zohrd> xD
<Stellafera> SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURE
<Michael> minecraft
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Is the head operator here Cave Johnson?
<Ragnano> dat minecraft o.o
<Kujo_Jojo> Science it works ... somehow
<SpadeKyurem[R]> BECAUSE WHY NOT
<MrDNA> SpadeKyurem[R]: Are you Cave Johnson?
<Ta_Dikin> He's raping it!!!!!!
<pony_3045> Combustiblelemons, lol indeed
<Stellafera> That is not how it works
<cowvarkian> that wouldnt work
<RainbowAsh> Recently they found that the half-life of DNA is a few million years, so any DNA from the dinosaur age is completely destroyed by now.
<MrDNA> Ta_Dikin: WITH A NEELE
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Science isnt about why
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: I'm not saying it's a possible factor. I'm saying it's hardly the major factor that some would claim. Again, counter to the normal laws of reproduction and what genes are about-- which is making more genes.
<CriticKitten> Woh, woh, woh. This is going way too fast. We need to dumb it down some more.
<WhatTheDerp-> this is FUCKIN SCIENCE, MATE! :D
<Ragnano> SpadeKyurem[R]: probably
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Its about why not
<Combustiblelemons> i love superjail :P
<pony_3045> they need warden
<pony_3045> too
<MrDNA> CriticKitten: Here, let me explain
<Stallion_of_War> Yup, the sap got hard over a long time; which is why the mosquito didn't rot, because it took a long time...
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: Impossible, I meant.
<Stallion_of_War> BRILLIANT
<Combustiblelemons> warden would know how to run this place.
<Kandarihu> Dr Grant explains why later on, right?
<Michael> science man
<DrPugjunior> YAY IM MISSED THE EPISODE :D
<SpadeKyurem[R]> THE POWER GLOVE
<LordDerpington> It's so bad.
<Stellafera> And make it a nice graphical interface?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> NOW YOU'RE PLAYING WITH POWER
<alexxm> why a frog?
<Deadlypon3> A babeh dinasur
<Stallion_of_War> AND THEN WE BUCKED WITH SCIENCE
<pony_3045> I HAVE A POWAH
<T-Rex1013> The wardone would know shit about running the park, he can barely run his superjail
<Combustiblelemons> plus alice wouldn't let dinos run amok
<Ragnano> dat baby o.o
<Michael> and that's how dinosaurs are made...
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Science: Throw stuff to the wall and see what sticks
<Stellafera> Cloned, short lived dinosaurs yay
<otakon> alexxm: plot point
<prince-dari> Are these uh, autoerotica?
<Ta_Dikin> And thats how Equestria was Made!
<ZZZ> ?
<pony_3045> KILL IT BEFORE IT LAY EG~ oh wait nevermind
<BlitzWing00> "Quick boys, look busy, the boss is here"
<Kencolt> I can't think but Benton Quest would sic Race Bannon on Hammond and tell him to punch him in the head.
<otakon> prince-dari: oh lord
<pony_4908> XD
<Combustiblelemons> autoerotica?
<TrixieMuffin> welp dinos didnt work out , now do ponies
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<Sundaysmile> auto erotica?
<Trollestia> AUTOEROTICA
<Michael> eggs!
<LordDerpington> Autoerotica = wanking
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Why do I think Cave Johnson runs this shit?
<Trollestia> They can do that for you
<Meanwhile> Those people are masturbation.
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: Because it's not a question of reproduction. It's theorized as a manner of population control.
<Combustiblelemons> indeed.
<Ta_Dikin> Robot Porn?
<Combustiblelemons> robot rock.
<Trollestia> And PUUUUUUUUSH
<otakon> oh lord
<Michael> screw the ride
<otakon> they just did
<T-Rex1013> they broke it
<Dark92Enigma-> PUSH!!!!! PUSH!!!!!!!!!1
<Blazing_Beatz> lol, "Can they do that?"
<Trollestia> Look at all of the autoerotica!!
<Sundaysmile> you broke tha rules!
<red_ony> hello everyone..how was today's episode? :)
<Alchemist> yeah, just waltz into a clean space research area
<Lindeman> Assum
<pony_3045> GET TEH FUK OUT OF MY EGGS!
<Punkie_Pue> amazing
<Michael> hai red_ony
<Combustiblelemons> dat leftclick
<Ragnano> red_ony: good i think
<weeping_pegasi82> I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET NO SPOILERS
<BlitzWing00> Where's the heat lamps?
<pony_4810> Wait was the guy on the intercom Samuel L. Jackson?
<Michael> red_ony: it was great :)
<princess-loveles> red_ony: you can find it on youtube already
<d3rb> red_ony, very good ep
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Pokemon eggs?
<T-Rex1013> red_ony no spoilers for 24 hours
<Zohrd> Spoiler: Scotaloo is a chicken
<Kotano> hi red_ony ,it was pretty good
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Togipi?
<LordDerpington> Top-class episode. Absolutely brilliant.
<Stallion_of_War> "Dang, I could really go for some scrambled eggs right now..."
<Blazing_Beatz> *QUE EVOLUTION MUSIC
<Stellafera> One of my favorite episodes it the entire series, so yes, it was good
<Dark92Enigma-> I'll take Patrick's advice: Push ponyville and take somewhere else
<red_ony> I haven't seeen it yet..will wait till tomorrow...:)
<Angeling> puuuuuuSSSHHHH!
<Saigneur> DUN DUN DUN, you got a pokemon
<prince-dari> Yeah, don't talk about the ep until 24 hours after it has aired please
<Michael> awwwwww
<BlitzWing00> *Face Hugger to the Face*
<Stellafera> IDIOT
<Sylandest> look, its a tiny killing machine
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Yoshi?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> ITS YOSHI!
<Combustiblelemons> dat animatronics
<Cypresswolf> C'mon out Spike
<Zohrd> yoshi haha
*ZZZ says "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW..."
<Meanwhile> Just think, that could grow up to murder you.
<Michael> Dear santa...
<Trollestia> Eughhhhhh
<VenHur> DAAAAAWWW
<Stallion_of_War> inb4 it bites his jugular vein
<pony_4461> kill it with fire
<DRHUnleashed> awwwww, lets name it killer
<thelonevelociraptor> Meanwhile: it will be fun
<Ta_Dikin> Chicken!
<Trollestia> Stallion_of_War: GO FOR THE JUGULAR
<LordDerpington> http://derpibooru.org/172706
<Alchemist> Meanwhile: well, so can a dog :D
<pony_4956668> stop spitting germ onto him
<TwilightArcanum> I still prefer puppetry and animatronics to CGI
<pony_3045> TO LATE THEY ALREADY LAYS EGGS!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Anything can kill you
<Dark_Horst> LordDerpington: oh god, fund it
<Jageman> LordDerpington: lol
<pony_3045> WHAT HAVE SCIENCE DONE!!!!!!!!!
<Kencolt> Brock saves Ash from permanent scarring. "No, Ash, you don't want to watch Picachu's mate lay her eggs. Picachu give live birth." "ICK!"
<Cajun> Do they take precautions to make sure...
<red_ony> so long since I've seen this
<Stallion_of_War> It's a good thing they didn't use DNA from a species of frog that can change it's gender if there's a lack of males or something
<Saigneur> LordDerpington: <3 daaaaaaaaaw
<Punkie_Pue> its simple!
<Ta_Dikin> LordDerpington: that is amazing!
<Punkie_Pue> simple
<Combustiblelemons> DNA splicing is so easy.
<CriticKitten> Oh yeah, sounds so simple
<RainbowAsh> Stallion_of_War, yeah, that would be completely moronic.
<ZZZ> DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW<3<3<3
<Stellafera> Depending on your method they only COULD end up as females, actually
<Combustiblelemons> life uh, uh finds a way.
<Alchemist> now this is fallacious science
<Meanwhile> Lesbian dinosaurs.
<Combustiblelemons> see.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Who in their right mind thinks reviving the dinosaurs is a smart idea?
<PterodacJoe11> but, but..
<pony_3045> What porpose of this guy? Just chillin around?
<red_ony> life uh..find a way...
<Stallion_of_War> RainbowAsh: People could end up getting eaten and the dinosaur population could run amok! How awful would that be?
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: ....not sure if want
<Michael> life... finds a way
<Dark_Horst> lesbian dinosaurs
<Trollestia> Life.... uh.... finds a way.... uh... yeah.
<Cajun> The Teiidae say hello
<Alchemist> SpadeKyurem[R]: why not?
<Kencolt> Alchemist: Read the novel-- they actually explain HOW the hell they bred in it.
<Combustiblelemons> I hate raptors.
<Blazing_Beatz> WHAT HAVE THEY DPNE
<Dark92Enigma-> YOU PACKED IT, YOU WARP IT IN A LUCHBOX,A DN YOU S-S-ELL IT! YOU S-S-SELL IT! YOU SELL IT!........and life, uh, finds a way, yeah.
<Deadlypon3> And then he snaps it's neck
<RainbowAsh> Stallion_of_War, luckily they all are professionals. They got white coats and everything.
<Dark92Enigma-> WRAPPED*
<DRHUnleashed> FORESHADOWING
<Deadlypon3> He snaps it's neck :p
<Michael> damn, i love dat sound
<Combustiblelemons> dat cow.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> BESSIE NO!
<Blazing_Beatz> Moooooo
<TrixieMuffin> Its my scientific opinion that shit will go down because otherwise the movie would be boring
<Stallion_of_War> You bread Rappers?
<Dark92Enigma-> NOT THE COW!
<ZZZ> GO HOME SCIENTEST UR DRUNK
<Ta_Dikin> Moo~ :S
<Michael> Moo ^o^
<Angeling> mmm Lets breed lots and lots of deadly dinosaurs
<Trollestia> FUCK THAT BULL
<princess-loveles> mooo
<d3rb> dont cha know
<Sundaysmile> Steak time!
<Angeling> noooo not the cow!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Super Brony is that you?
<Ta_Dikin> :S Moo~
<pony_4908> Dis foreshadowing
<Kandarihu> TrixieMuffin, the writers will find a way.
<Angeling> save the good cuts first!
<Stallion_of_War> Females also have horns
<Saigneur> nomnomnom the moomoomoo
<BlitzWing00> Yes have an exhibit where you can't see anything
<DRHUnleashed> moo
<VenHur> Nooooo! SuperBrony64!! Get outta theeere!!
<Cypresswolf> Sea Bass? No Dinosaur meat?
<CriticKitten> So....let's review. We're making a park full of dinosaurs....FOR KIDS.
<Stellafera> Raincow, come in raincow, we need your help...
<Blazing_Beatz> NOT THE COW
<princess-loveles> poor mr. moo
<Trollestia> Meoooooooooooooooo
<Azuredragon> Those are some mean flesh eating plants
<pony_3045> sure they professionals, they have a cows
<Ta_Dikin> :S Moo~
<Angeling> GG cow
<TrixieMuffin> T-Rex shot first
<Zohrd> ñom
<CriticKitten> And no one at any point said "this sounds like a fucking terrible idea"
<SpadeKyurem[R]> CriticKitten: We have no possible way to keep them contained
<Angeling> nom nom nom
<Stallion_of_War> Technically cows are females; they're bovine as a species
<pony_3045> Moo for mee
<VenHur> Noooooooo!! SuperBrony64!!!
<red_ony> they have there permits
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: What kid doesn't like dinosaurs?
<red_ony> *ei
<Lindeman> I loved them
<Punkie_Pue> nothing will go wrong!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> How did the government approve of this shit?
<Stallion_of_War> Technically technically cows are bovine who have had offspring
<Combustiblelemons> i loved them when i was a kid
<Cajun> Cattle, bovine is just cattle-like
<Ta_Dikin> Sweetie Belle Moo~
<Combustiblelemons> wrote a book on them ^_^
<Stellafera> I think every kid goes through I dinosaur phase
<TwilightArcanum> The costa rica governemnt is terrible
<Combustiblelemons> yeah
<ZZZ> LOL
<Alchemist> SpadeKyurem[R]: why should they have to?
<Combustiblelemons> yeah to dinosaur phase
<CriticKitten> Just imagine if the raptors learned how to smear cheetah blood on themselves. They'd be too fast to catch.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So...you want to make a dinosaur park....
<Kandarihu> Stallion_of_War, government of where? This isn't America. I think Dr Grant owns the island privately.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Ok you're good!
<pony_4908> Yes! The #1 MLP comic just arrived!
<Stallion_of_War> Kandarihu: What did I say about a government? I don't recall mentioning one
<Jageman> Kandarihu: He is leasing the island
<pony_4908> It's about time. :P
<Stellafera> SEEMS SAFE
<SpadeKyurem[R]> But where did he get the fucking funding?
<Meanwhile> Here lies cow, it will be missed.
<VenHur> Hey, here's an better idea.
<pony_3045> I am
<DRHUnleashed> well, who's hungry?
<flitter_heart22> hi everypony:P
<Azuredragon> Who's up for stake?
<CriticKitten> That looks delicious.
<Combustiblelemons> indeed.
<Kandarihu> Stallion_of_War, sorry. I meant to ping SpadeKyurem[R]
<Trollestia> I'm STARVING.
<Jageman> SpadeKyurem[R]: from his company gentech i thingk
<TwilightArcanum> In the book he got investors by going around showing off a miniture elephant
<VenHur> Why not make an ANAMATRONIC Jurrasic Park, you dumbbells?!
<pony_max> I do not like
<Kotano> do they serve dinosaur meat?
<princess-loveles> .~. i wouldnt be hungry after that
<Stallion_of_War> Kandarihu: It's fine
<Angeling> is that dino steak?
<VenHur> Ah well...
<Michael> hai flitter_heart22
*Combustiblelemons is eating a chilli pizza right now
<Trollestia> VenHur: What fun would THAT be?
<Combustiblelemons> :3
<Sundaysmile> damn ads
<pony_max> :S
<misteriks> i forgot how long that film
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I have to ask, the shotguns and such might work against the small dinos like raptors right?
<Trollestia> Combustiblelemons: Damnit, I just have ramen :(
<VenHur> Trollestia: ...Negative 1?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> What the fuck do they have to stop a T-Rex?
<T-Rex1013> nyeh
<J_E_Smith71> VenHur: Yeah like the ride at Universeal
<Trollestia> VenHur: Try less.
<Cypresswolf> We'll have a coopen day or something
<pony_3045> translation: DAMN NATURE U SCARY
<SpadeKyurem[R]> A shotgun aint gonna do shit
<Combustiblelemons> pizza 1 ups everything.
<princess-loveles> oh ! i was wondering what to eat but now i remember i got ramen
<Blazing_Beatz> They have a dart gun
<VenHur> Trollestia: ...90?
<Blazing_Beatz> lol
<Stellafera> Hmm... nah
<Stallion_of_War> Malcom's a bit of an arsehole...
<Blazing_Beatz> Definatley a Dart Gun
<Kujo_Jojo> SpadeKyurem[R] nukes
<otakon> yes genetic power
<Angeling> they use a party cannon for the trex
<TwilightArcanum> They had a dart rocket launcher
<pony_4810> You know what would solve all of their problems? Nano machines.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So...bets on who dies first
<Trollestia> VenHur: You can't guess right at all. Think less than -1, more than +-1.
<otakon> pony_4810: Gray Goo Scenario
<Dark92Enigma-> YOU PACKAGED IT, YOU WRAPPED IT IN A LUNCHBOX, AND THEN YOU SELL IT, YOU SELL IT, YOU SELL IT!.........:[
<red_ony> why did they invite thgis guy again?
<Angeling> lawyers will always die first =x
<Jageman> SpadeKyurem[R]: in armor piercing rifle round would kill the trex
<Havok> Time for me to leave for a while, cya later :D
<T-Rex1013> So learning is all bullshit becaue we're just learning what other people know
<Stellafera> Great scientist right there, says that if you don't do the research yourself it sucks
<Lindeman> Cya Havok
<Dark92Enigma-> red_ony: so we can laugh at him
<TwilightArcanum> The lawyer invited Malcom
<Stellafera> Clearly you should never listen to your peers
<Angeling> bai
<Jageman> SpadeKyurem[R]: they are not covered in armor
<Azuredragon> "Goss Science is built on the shoulders of Giants"
<Azuredragon> Good*
<BlitzWing00> Man, just kick this guy out....he's a wank.
<Jageman> SpadeKyurem[R]: they are just big
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Stellafera: Clearly because they never might skew their results
<pony_3045> count science word
<RainbowAsh> Actually a big meteorite selected them for extinction
<T-Rex1013> Nature didnt do shit, twas a meteor
<TrixieMuffin> Heshould die , his only point is : "I dont like your atitude , Sir!" , also hes wrong
<Trollestia> RainbowAsh: Probably
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Jageman: But I would prefer a gun that would let me not get close to the fucker
<Combustiblelemons> a meteorite is natural :P
<Kencolt> Meteors are natural.
<T-Rex1013> LAst I checked Meteors werent part of Earth's natural environment
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Shot guns only work good at close range
<Stellafera> The giant lava flows covering India also had a bit to do with it
<Combustiblelemons> lol see
<otakon> aggressive living things
<Ta_Dikin> Rape!!!
<otakon> plants
<Bronysith> http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/155409_640688045987_1246570702_n.jpg
<SpadeKyurem[R]> SOMEWHERE YOU DONT WANT TO BE NEAR A T REX
<Jageman> SpadeKyurem[R]: Rifle would let you say away from it
<otakon> that doesn't make sense
<Kujo_Jojo> space selected thier extinction
<Ta_Dikin> Plant Rape!!!
<pony_3045> inb4: there is no black guy
<princess-loveles> <3
<Jageman> SpadeKyurem[R]: that is why i said rifle round
<T-Rex1013> SpadeKyurem[R] Im a t-rex. Rawr.
<flitter_heart22> :|
<Lindeman> Holyshitthereisnoblackguy
<Alchemist> dramatic close up, lets hear what he has to say
<Michael> later everypony :) going to play some PS2
<otakon> The bloodsucking lawyer
<CriticKitten> Dat vampire
<Stellafera> Ha
<SpadeKyurem[R]> But why the fuck did they revive the DEADLY dinos?!
<otakon> says thank you
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye Michael :)
<T-Rex1013> bye Micheal
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[R]: variety
<Lindeman> They are probably not allowed around the KFC manager
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], rule of cool
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Why not just the harmless ones!
<Jageman> SpadeKyurem[R]: they sell better
<pony_3045> KIDS
<Azuredragon> KIDS, That's their name
<pony_3045> FUK U
<Stellafera> Yes, invite your kids
<Kotano> SpadeKyurem[R]: Cause they're the cool dinos.
<princess-loveles> ''were doing it tonight o-o '' is what he said in his ear
<T-Rex1013> CHILDREN; LIVING THE LIVING DINOSAURS DREAM
<Jageman> SpadeKyurem[R]: you would pay big money to see a t rex
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[R]: no such thing when you've got 3 ton reptiles covered in iron hard bone plating
<TrixieMuffin> By that logic , in 5 billiom years the sun will swollow the earth so we can do as we please cause "nature" has chosen earth to be destroyedanyway
*VenHur holds a Dino Riders toy.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> There are SO MANY logic failures here!
*pony_3045 hates kids
<otakon> IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY
<Paquack> I want that Jeep!
<BlitzWing00> Google Self Driving Cars
<pony_3045> i hate kids then i was kid
<otakon> YOU CAN SEE THE GUY TURNING THE WHEEL
<Stellafera> IPADS
<Jageman> otakon: they are not covered in iron hard bone
<Sundaysmile> lol cd-roms
<CriticKitten> No expense.
<pony_4908> NO FUCKING WAY
<PONY> dat computer expert
<Sundaysmile> I miss those things
<awesomenessx2me> maybe some none meat eating dinos would have done better
<DRHUnleashed> CD-ROMS
<Gilda> Hello again
<Kotano> CD-Rom, holy shit
<Combustiblelemons> i like kids :3 they always say the most random things
<Trollestia> HOLY FUCK ZOOM AND ENHANCE THAT SHIT
<Lindeman> I hated kids before it was cool
<Stellafera> I wonder what they'd think of Ipads
<RainbowAsh> TrixieMuffin, the hope is that we might migrate to other stars by then. If we can survive the next few centuries
<otakon> Jageman: no they have PLATES of it, they're also fiercly territorial and freaking strong
<pony_3045> hey kid, GET THE FUK OUT OF ME
<princess-loveles> holy fuck this shit its a dinosaur what the fuck
<PONY> Lindeman, no, I did, and made it cool.
<T-Rex1013> TrixieMuffin almost. Humans no longer require Nature to choose for us. If the sun eats earth, then we will focus all of our energy in findind a new planet
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Also why is the t-rex not locked up behind super heavy security?
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], she is
<Kandarihu> Lindeman, what about the Cutie Mark Crusaders?
<Jageman> otakon: its not that tough compaired to modern weapons
<pony_1390> Pardon me if I start firing off random Getter Robo references.
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[R]: bc it's a T-Rex
<Sundaysmile> he will debate the fuck outta you
<CriticKitten> The kid has Goldblum disease
<SpadeKyurem[R]> All I see is the flimsy fence
<pony_3045> because they have a dart gun
<Meanwhile> Go away Tim.
<Meanwhile> I don't like you.
<Barbetos> Sam Neill does a lot of tv shows
<Meanwhile> I hope you get eaten by the raptor.
<Barbetos> Damn. Never knew.
<VenHur> Shaddup Timmy.
<Alchemist> go home Tim.. You're drunk.
<Paquack> God dammit Tim!
<RainbowAsh> Poor Timmy
<Jageman> otakon: calcium can only be so strong
<Sundaysmile> OWNED
<otakon> Jageman: dude Crocodiles take a 12 guage shot at POINT BLANK RANGE in either the head or stomach to kill, I think Dino's are tougher than that
<princess-loveles> lol
<flitter_heart22> im gonna play pinkie pie's hyperactive chat bye guys!<3
<Lindeman> Jageman, they are obviously teenagers
<Iwa> SpadeKyurem[R]: Guess it's blindly trusting on modern technology...bit in the mindset of "I created you, damnit, so i can contain you"
<Optical> Wow, GG
<Kencolt> He's doomed. Socially.
<T-Rex1013> Meteors are the trolls of space
<Sundaysmile> Samuel Jackson!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> A shotgun isnt going to do shit to a Dino
<otakon> Jageman: thigh bone of a human is harder than concrete of the same size and thickness
<Combustiblelemons> nope.avi
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Raptors are fast
<Ta_Dikin> Lol
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[R]: exactly
<pony_3045> oh!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> You would get killed before you could fire a shot
<pony_3045> Black guy!
<Blazing_Beatz> ooooo, so it was the Hurrican that fucked them over
<T-Rex1013> Iwa tell that to Victor Frankenstein
*Combustiblelemons holds onto his butt
<SpadeKyurem[R]> A t-rex is huge it would take a few shots to down it
<Jageman> otakon: that is because of how brittle concrete is when its thin
*`Xenu butts onto his hold
*alexxm farts loudly
<Lindeman> He is hunting KFC manager
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[R]: not neccessarily but that shot HAS to down it
<Boulderdash> I'm tired of these MF dinos in this MF park!
<Trollestia> Whe the ACTUAL fucking FUCK are we talking about ETHICS during a MOVIE? What Colonel Sanders did was wrong, it was pretty much a bad idea.
<Alchemist> otakon: I think it's because of the structure: a hollow ring is the most stable.
<T-Rex1013> A SINGLE BULLET CANNOT HARM ME
<pony_3045> i just wondering how long he'll lives
<Iwa> T-Rex1013: Oh I did, I was Igor's more handsome brother :)
<Sundaysmile> Scales so large it would be like kevlar
<otakon> ^
<Lindeman> T-rex1013, But TWO
<Jageman> otakon: and no animal can take a rifle round
*Kujo_Jojo runs away from his but
<Stellafera> SEEMS SAFE
<Meanwhile> Yeah we're going to hit it.
<otakon> basically plus hard bone and dense muscle
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Whats the name of that dinosaur that has armor plating and a club tail?
<PterodacJoe11> dat meeting
<Sundaysmile> Bones thick enough to rival concrete
<pony_3045> yes build giant gates in a desert
<T-Rex1013> Iwa Frankenstien didnt have a partner. He was all alone when he created the monster
<princess-loveles> king kong
<Paquack> Anyone remember the Jarassic Park game at Chuck E' Cheeses?
<Kotano> SpadeKyurem[R]: Stegosaurus?
<Ta_Dikin> Yay~
<red_ony> Jageman: how bout a hippo?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> That thing would be impossible to kill
<otakon> Jageman: has anyone shot a rifle round into a whale? bc that's the equivalent
<CriticKitten> Spared no expense
<DRHUnleashed> ankylosaurus or something like that?
<Combustiblelemons> shotgun has a lot of power in it
<Jageman> otakon: kevlar can not stop rifle rounds
<T-Rex1013> KING KONG AINT GOT SHIT ON ME
<VenHur> Hm...if Dino DNA revives dinosaurs...then...What'll happens...IF we get injected by Dino DNA?
<BlitzWing00> a Sniper shot to the eye will take down a T-Rex
<Optical> King Kongasaurus
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Ankylosaurous thats it
<Alchemist> otakon: basically it can be seen as a bio composite
<TwilightArcanum> SpadeKyurem[R]: They had a rocket launcher or some shit in the books and they blew up 3 raptors with it and used it to launch a giant dart into the T-rex when it escaped. Shotguns are easier and more logical so I guess that's why they have them in the movie
<Jageman> otakon: yes they have
<red_ony> Jageman: those are deadly^^
<Jageman> otakon: it killed it
<T-Rex1013> VenHur THATS NOT HOW SCIENCE WORKS
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Those things have fucking armor and a shot gun aint gonna do shit
<VenHur> AW FUCK, I DON'T WANT TO BE MUTATED! [goes into a coma]
<Combustiblelemons> this sucks.
<Trollestia> Let's all look at the poisonous deadly dinosaurs!!
<Iwa> T-Rex1013: He did? Damned Hollywood spawning the idea of a Igor slave working for him...:(
<Bjornfot> sup niggers
<Azuredragon> Sorry, the CGI budget ran out.
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<Sundaysmile> MOVING ON!
<princess-loveles> damn adds
<RainbowAsh> Troll'd
<Meanwhile> The problem with large enclosures.
<Combustiblelemons> no diloposaurus but they'll be here
<Ta_Dikin> Lolollolololol
<Angeling> Trollolol
<Lindeman> Ad-block my friend
<T-Rex1013> Iwa yeah, Hollywood is an idiot sometimnes
<Stellafera> Seriously, don't put all the dangerous animals on the drive through tours
<Combustiblelemons> soon...
<pony_3045> BRONTOSAURUS: I Am A Stegosaurus! :I
*Kujo_Jojo mutates VenHur
<SpadeKyurem[R]> But how effective is a shot gun gonna be against a Raptor?
<red_ony> what ads? :D
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Those things are fast
<Alchemist> Just put'em in cages. Problem solved.
<pony_1390> @VenHur We become members of the glorious Dinosaur Empire?...
<Angeling> not very
<princess-loveles> only me
<Blazing_Beatz> SAM JACKSON@
<Lindeman> pony_3045 I like trains
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], bullets are still faster. If you hit it, it will bleed
<SpadeKyurem[R]> You essentally have one shot and if you miss you're dead
<otakon> Jageman: still point is dino's are naturally armored like crocodiles. Unless it's an extremely high power rifle it won't down it in one shot
<Sundaysmile> I loved the days when you could smoke in the office
<SpadeKyurem[R]> RainbowAsh: You have to hit it first
<BlitzWing00> Newman!
<red_ony> Ostrich = rl raptor..don't mess with them birds
<Kotano> I'm tired of these motherfucking dinos...
<Iwa> T-Rex1013: Guess it was the formula those days...Mad genius plus retarded assistent...both in kid's and serious adult themes
<TrixieMuffin> Jurassic Park drinking game : take a shot whenever :"We spared no expense!"
<Paquack> It's all Windows ME's fault!
<Kandarihu> pony_1390, inB4 Terrible Thunder Lizards.
<Jageman> otakon: nothing can take a rifle round to the head
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Gabe Newel?
<Ta_Dikin> Nedry!!!!
<pony_3045> gaben
<Blazing_Beatz> oh great, this asshat
<prince-dari> >nothing
<Jageman> otakon: nothing
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Is that you?
<Yahooz> wuz gud niqqa
<pony_3045> i need some food
<Trollestia> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxxx71sIu31r9e4mmo1_500.jpg
<prince-dari> >Crocodile gets shot in the head
<Lindeman> GABEN AND KFC GUY!
<Yahooz> wuz real gud
<T-Rex1013> SpadeKyurem[R] Very effective if its only one raptor, since REAL velociraptors were ONLY 3 FEET TALL AND WERE PROBABLY SCAVENGERS.
<prince-dari> >walks away
<otakon> Jageman: what rifle? .308? or a .50 cal? specify
<Optical> Dat Product placement
<prince-dari> Happens all the time
<TrixieMuffin> Oh he has a gift with people!
<Sundaysmile> look at all those pizza boxes
<Blazing_Beatz> Hey! The KFC guy is Samuel Jackson...Respect Him!
<TwilightArcanum> I think the people were supposed to be in buildings if anything went wrong. You can't miss with a shotgun in a hallway
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I would prefer to use a fast firing weapon against raptors
<otakon> prince-dari: my dad has told me stories of him flubbing a shot on a deer and the round RICOCHETING OFF it's HEAD
<princess-loveles> i eat aaaaaaaaaalot and people think im anorexic since im no fat at all
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[R]: no, you need POWER
<SpadeKyurem[R]> A shot gun doesnt work well for a fast dino
<LordDerpington> Best excuse for not working: "It's compiling!"
<pony_4908> Origins of the modern nerd.
<Jageman> otakon: it depends on the dino
<CriticKitten> And you have a fenced-in area for the t-rex on your guided tour WHY?!?
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[R]: SPAS loaded with slugs
<Ta_Dikin> Trollestia: that was incredable
<VenHur> Kujo_Jojo: Not today, Eager McBeaver!
<pony_3045> too quite
<SpadeKyurem[R]> otakon: Whats more worth it a power gun that if you miss your fucker or a fast firing weapon
<Combustiblelemons> SpadeKyurem[R]: you need stopping power to kill a beast that big not rate of fire
<Alchemist> I think there are instances of humans surviving a head shot
*VenHur runs like hell.
<Zohrd> What about explosive ammo?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> *fucked
<Trollestia> LordDerpington: Or, of course, the infallable "It's calibrating!"
<Trollestia> Thanks Ta_Dikin
<Combustiblelemons> i'd say a shotgun or a 50 caliber weapon would do it.
<ZZZ> IMMA LISTENIN' to the most AWESOME song ever
<Meanwhile> Calibrations.
<Kandarihu> He's making so many messed up computer references that I'd cry foul at this movie if he weren't probably lying his butt off.
<T-Rex1013> FUN FACT: THe raptors portrayed in this movie are actually Utah Raptors, the largest raptor found todate. Velociraptors were a much smaller breed, being only 3 feet tall, most likely covered in feathers, and were porabbaly scavengers
<Stellafera> T Rex of the movie will be very interesting
<BlitzWing00> A Slug would mess those dinosaurs up.
<Trollestia> FUCKING GOD
<pony_3045> also dinos wasnt lizards, they were chickens
<Blazing_Beatz> lolol...Woman
<Kujo_Jojo> VenHur I have plenty of serum and time it will happen
<Combustiblelemons> say whaaaat.
<Zohrd> What about explosive or incendiary ammo?
<Kandarihu> And I'm crying foul on "Man destroying God"
<Sundaysmile> BITCH
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I would think a T rex would take several shotgun shots to down it
<Alchemist> badumm*tshh
<Angeling> lol woman
<otakon> Zohrd: well the problem is if the round doesn't penetrate the skin it might not kill it
<CriticKitten> Utah raptors? So they have very open relationships?
<cowvarkian> also, argonians are trees and khajits arent cats
<TrixieMuffin> get your stinkin god out of my movies
<Sylandest> lol, CriticKitten
<T-Rex1013> CriticKitten most likely
<otakon> nom nom nom
<Ta_Dikin> Goat wins!!!!
<Stellafera> T Rex got downgraded
<Paquack> Dinosaurs were Scootaloos?
<Jageman> otakon: .50 BMG would do it
<Optical> I'm still waiting for th dinos
<VenHur> Kujo_Jojo: You sick little...
<Trollestia> Look at that goat! It's so cuuute~~~
<Iwa> Stock goat sounds, Yay
<`Xenu> BURP
<TwilightArcanum> You know the Dilophosaurus is also the wrong size those get up to twelve feet tall
<Blazing_Beatz> YES, The Goat shall die
<pony_4908> "They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes...!" :P
<Kotano> Iron Will nooooo
<Trollestia> Wait, it's gonna do what??
<otakon> Goat A wishes he had stayed workign with iron Will
<SpadeKyurem[R]> How many shot gun blasts would it take to down a T rex?
<Lindeman> Baaaaaa
<LordDerpington> Goats are not lambs
<T-Rex1013> NOOOO IRON WILLL!!!!
<Combustiblelemons> yeah, well they're carnivores.
<Sundaysmile> Iron WIll is a bull not a goat
<Lindeman> Fuck the dinosaurs, that goat is scary!
<Stellafera> This really gets my goat
<prince-dari> >implying a shotgun would kill it at all
<cowvarkian> argonians are trees, and khajit arent cats
<ValhallaFusion> It willy!
<CriticKitten> Yes you can.
<Kandarihu> Sundaysmile, he's a minotaur
<d3rb> :# aww goat
<Kujo_Jojo> VenHur to make sure I injected myself
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[R]: you couldn't kill it with that, too large. It would be like trying to take a whale down with a shotgun
<Combustiblelemons> goats have the weirdest eyes.
<`Xenu> IF SOME DINO TRIES TO BLOCK SHOW THEM YOU ROCK
<Combustiblelemons> they're like hyprnotoad eyes.
<glitchdetector> MJÆÆÆHHh◙~
<SpadeKyurem[R]> prince-dari: Which is why I say they need bigger shit than that
<ValhallaFusion> What are we watching?
<otakon> Booooooooooooooooooooooooooring
<T-Rex1013> NOO IRON WILL'S ASSITENTS!!!
<Brony2thextreme> this is an awesome website XD
<Stellafera> Goat to be something exciting soon
<pony_3045> http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/196/cache/feathered-dino-update-change-age_19676_600x450.jpg
<Angeling> At a million shotgun blasts the trex might die
<SpadeKyurem[R]> They have nothing at all to stop a T rex
<otakon> hammond is dissappoint
<Ta_Dikin> I hate that Man!!!
<Angeling> probably..
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Morons
<Combustiblelemons> you know what kills everything? an RPG.
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<TrixieMuffin> me too
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<pony_4908> Dat Jeff
<Jageman> otakon: if you know where to shoot, a .308 could work though
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/HwmDW.jpg
<Combustiblelemons> me too
<Optical> `Xenu: Congrats, you just won an internet
<TwilightArcanum> The guns aren't there to kill the dinosaurs, colonel Saners didn't want to kill them because he values them more than people
<Trollestia> We all really hat that man.
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: wont kill sumerpan
<Brony2thextreme> hat?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> THE DINOS ARE DEADLY
<Sundaysmile> He is Discord!
<cowvarkian> I saw that one
<Lindeman> HAT?! GABE?!
<Combustiblelemons> sumerpan is invincible to all except frying pans.
<LordDerpington> Oh, god, Sumerpan.
<Punkie_Pue> I immagine a round from a tank could do some damage.
<princess-loveles> but flying dinosaur can leave the island since a bird can e.e
<Trollestia> We all really hate that man.
<CriticKitten> Well, it's very simple, miss. You see, you gather six rainbow-colored gems called "Chaos Emeralds".....
<Brony2thextreme> did you say hat HAT HAAAAAATTTTT
<T-Rex1013> THERE ARE ONLY 2 THINGS THAT KILL A T-REX: A SPINOSAURUS AND ANOTHER T-REX and maybe a rocket launcher like they used in the actual Jurassic Park book
<Trollestia> FUCKING GOD
<Zohrd> What about a Gatling gun vs a T rex? :)
<otakon> Jageman: yeah the eye, mouth. But everywhere else you've got to thick muscle and heavy bones and plates.
<pony_3045> http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00475/SNN2525GX1_475740a.jpg
<RainbowAsh> She is not very smart for a scientist, is she?
<Angeling> i still bet on trex
<Jageman> otakon: so?
<Paquack> Dat Jeff Goldblum
<cowvarkian> RainbowAsh: she is a paleontologist
<LordDerpington> You old dog, Malcolm.
<Brony2thextreme> well imma go play banjo tooie XD
<Stellafera> Come on T Rex
<pony_3045> and scootaloo at the end
<Combustiblelemons> most charming man in the world
<Kandarihu> `Xenu, please pardon my nitpicking, but for the sake of rhyming, that ought to be "If some(2) dino tries to block,(5) show them that you rock!(5)"
<otakon> Jageman: now shoot it in the eye when it's rushing you full speed
<pony_4908> RainbowAsh: Paleontologist. Figures.
<Alchemist> this is not chaos theory
<otakon> RainbowAsh: different area of science
<Dark_Horst> or becasue you cant aim for shit, dude
<SpadeKyurem[R]> how fast can raptors even run?
<Kencolt> He's a Chos Theoriticin, she's a paleobotanist. Different disciplines.
<otakon> THIS SHOT
<Meanwhile> SpadeKyurem[R]: How fast is the wind.
<otakon> YU CAN SEE HIM!
<Stellafera> IDIOT
<Jageman> otakon: 2,650 ft/s, would go right through the skull anywhere
<PONY> HA
<glitchdetector> WHO IS DRIVING
<RainbowAsh> otakon, yeah, but that's just common sense
<otakon> Jageman: a skull like a battering ram?
<princess-loveles> 4the other car is missing
<Combustiblelemons> why is there a steering wheel on the car if it drives itself?
<CriticKitten> No, that's just Jeff Goldblum
<Sundaysmile> Windows 98 is driving
<cowvarkian> glitchdetector: it drives itself
<Optical> GHOST DRIVER
<Jageman> otakon: yes
<Optical> OH SHIT
<Zohrd> A Gatling vs a T rex
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Combustiblelemons: If the auto drive fails?
<Sundaysmile> they're fucking doomed
<CriticKitten> ....wait, you don't have locks on your car doors? WHY?!?
<Iwa> glitchdetector: Jesus took the wheel
<Stellafera> You aren't supposed to get out when there's freaking bison outside your car, much less T Rexes
<Jageman> otakon: that is how guns work
<Combustiblelemons> it's sorta on rails SpadeKyurem[R]
<glitchdetector> GOOD GAWD
<Angeling> T rex > gattling gun
<otakon> Jageman: dude have you SEEN a T-Rex skull? it's HUGE and HEAVILY plated
<Lambda> Damn! I must be a genius!
<cowvarkian> Stellafera: bison are bastards
<pony_4908> Combustiblelemons: If they ever have to go offroad and outrun a T-Rex? :P They really thought ahead there.
<Combustiblelemons> gatling gun beats all angeling
<Trollestia> CriticKitten: I have no idea. Somebody should critique them on that.
<Stormy> o.o
<T-Rex1013> SpadeKyurem[R] Depends on which one. Utah Raptors were most likely actual predators, so prbably fast enough to chase down other dinos.
<pony_3045> http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/images/Deinonychus_feathered.jpg
<Jageman> otakon: you over estimate the strength of calcium
<Combustiblelemons> true pony_4908

<Meanwhile> Hey listen
<CriticKitten> HEY
<CriticKitten> LOOK
<Combustiblelemons> because plot device.
<CriticKitten> HEY
<pony_2592> hi
<ZZZ> ghosts haunt the place
<Combustiblelemons> i can agree with that logic
<glitchdetector> STAY HE SAID
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lolwhat
<PinkiePyro> mmmmppphhmppph
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So in reality, you would have to have NERVES OF STEEL TO HIT A FAST RAPTOR COMING RIGHT AT YOU
<pony_3045> timmy
<Anaruski> timmay!
<Trollestia> WOAH CHECK THAT SHIT
<cowvarkian> I really wish timmy died
<otakon> Jageman: you over estimate the stopping power of a .308, six feet of water will stop it so why not 2 feet of solid bone?
<CriticKitten> Timmy: incapable of following simple directions
<Negiwok> timmmmyy
<Stellafera> You deserve whatever is coming for you kid
<Saigneur> TIMMY !!!!
<Sundaysmile> timmy fell down the well
<PinkiePyro> mppph
<Trollestia> CHECK. THAT. SHIT. OUT.
<pony_3045> kill timmy
<Sundaysmile> and then got eaten
<Optical> THERE'S A DINOSAUR, LET GO RUN AT IT
<TrixieMuffin> 0 for effort lady
<glitchdetector> its TIMMY TIME
<RainbowAsh> Why isn't that in an enclosure?
<otakon> welp it's 2:50, I'm out for now
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Are we in Terrydactyl land now?
<Jageman> otakon: the trex skull was not made to stop bullets
<Negiwok> omg they have killed timmy !!!
<Wrek> 05if that was me timmy wouldnt be abel to move an inch without me snappign him back in place
<otakon> RainbowAsh: herbs roam free
<Alchemist> goddamit Tim, you're just like Carl from the walking dead, you are never where you are supposed to be!
<Sundaysmile> tricerapony
<pony_3045> kill that kid!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> When did we get into Banjo Tooie?
<Wrek> 05you dont run away in a place like that
<Trollestia> SpadeKyurem[R]: I don't know, you're the navigator
<Combustiblelemons> those feels.
<Stellafera> Smart
<Jageman> otakon: the difference is the water bleeds away the energy of the round
<Optical> It's only a dinosaur, nothing to be scared of
<Trollestia> CHECK THE SHIT LOOK AT THE SHHHEIIIT
<otakon> Jageman: well you don't know that, but what is the biggest animal killed with a .308? anyway I'm out for now
<CriticKitten> RainbowAsh: Because obviously herbivores don't need to be kept in enclosures for safety reasons or anything
<princess-loveles> ew
<RainbowAsh> otakon, more people get killed by hippos than by lions each year. You don't want to roam big herbivores roam free.
<brony2thextreme> ive always loved banjo tooie
<Azuredragon> We landed in Star Foz Adventures!
<cowvarkian> Wrek: unless you want to be crushed or eaten
<glitchdetector> oh noes
<Azuredragon> Fox*
<Trollestia> Azuredragon: Where's Krystal?
<Jageman> otakon: the skull would absorb the energy and be punctured
<Iwa> brony2thextreme: Terrydactyl Land? :)
<otakon> Jageman: the bullet would shatter
<pony_3045> http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2012/04/y_huali.jpg
<Stellafera> If it doesn't eat meat there's no danger I mean look at hippos... oh wait they are more dangerous than lions
<ZZZ> HOLY MUTHA OF ~
<T-Rex1013> Pterdactyle
<Trollestia> HE LOVES FUCKING DINOSAURS
<red_ony> there already are pretty scary things on this planet as is...a hiooppotamus for example..look it up... up to 45000 kg, 6 inch thick skin , 25 mph fast, extremely agressive; kill hundreds/year
<Anaruski> how to not spook a dinosaur, touch it everywhere, exteraly and internaly...
<Jageman> otakon: but would not stop
<Combustiblelemons> dinophilia
<brony2thextreme> sadly im only at jolly rogers lagoon :(

<Meanwhile> Smooth.
<Stellafera> How To Train Your Dragon was filled with Gak on Euro movie night
<pony_4908> Dat humanoid creature in Equestria... D:

<cowvarkian> Trollestia: boring and repetitive
<SpadeKyurem[R]> GREAT SECURITY IDIOTS
<Sundaysmile> makes your smokes taste like lighter fluid
<PONY> back in the day when the good guys still smoked in the movies
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The Tessarak?
<Anaruski> ms-park security is offline...
<Trollestia> cowvarkian: Ain't that the truth. At least we got some Season 3 Pony episodes, that helps me get through the week.
<Bogy> hes evil.... evil.... EVIIIL!
<Kencolt> I use a Zippo. And can't imagine using anything else.
<Combustiblelemons> that LN2 storage
<Optical> SOMEONE SET US UP THE BOMB
<Zohrd> Gaben is destructing the HL3 engine?
<cowvarkian> Sundaysmile: thats why you only use them for setting fires
<TwilightArcanum> The guy in the straw hat that gave him the shaving cream can is paying him like ten million to steal this stuff
<SpadeKyurem[R]> WHY IS THIS SECURITY SO SHIT
<cowvarkian> or don't smoke
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], the security is supposed to be ready for opening day, not necessarily for when only staff and 2 scientists and a rogue moralist are around
<TwilightArcanum> he turned the security off
<Trollestia> SpadeKyurem[R]: It's like the TSA before 2001
<VenHur> First they revives dinosaurs with Dino DNA...Then maybe...they'll mutates... [gulp] ...us.
<Ditzy_Doo> yay..

<SpadeKyurem[R]> Does anyone know the name of that frilled dinosaur?
<Paquack> Is that Samuel L.?
<Blazing_Beatz> And the fat guy screws them over
<VenHur> Iwa: Well, uh...

<Trollestia> pony_3045: Okay, it just needs more context is all :D
<Paquack> Damn. 6_9
<Trollestia> A... complete SLUT?
<CriticKitten> If he wanted to escape the park, couldn't he just drive out? >_>
<Alchemist> Trollestia: slob
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Look a half life 3 disc!
<CriticKitten> Why shut down all the security on the fences?
<Meanwhile> It's on an island.

<Zohrd> Gaben is abandoning the hl3 project
<Lindeman> NM, you?
<Trollestia> Oh well... Alchemist, he's probably one of those too :D
<pony_4908> Gaben
<CriticKitten> It's on an island, yes, but the park itself is designed with entrances and exits that don't involve being shocked to death
<Blazing_Beatz> Why Did you Go Inside the Damn Velociraptor Cage....WHY
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, just to cover his escape.
<CriticKitten> Why not use those? >_>
<SpadeKyurem[R]> SEEMS LEGIT

<Kencolt> SpadeKyurem[R]: The book has a lot more "ecience" in it-- much of which the author admits probably wouldn't actually work-- and a fair number of scenes were missing, which later got used in The Lost World.
<T-Rex1013> SHES A FUCKING KID GIVE HER A FUCKING BREAK
<Combustiblelemons> so how did he see the guy on the toilet?
<Combustiblelemons> he didn't move.
<Mejzen> NAAW CUTIE DINOSAUR<33

<Dark92Enigma-> Ninosmr: yes
*T-Rex was out of fucks to give
<Angeling> now lets play spin the car!
<SirGanjalf> I'd say "fuck" too(and a lot) if i were on their place
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Kencolt: "science"
<SpadeKyurem[R]> ?
<Jageman> wasn't the T-rex a savanger?
<twixie_sprinkle> T-Rex1013: but hating on kids makes us feel superior!
<LordDerpington> You've got to credit Michael Crichton - he did do his research well for his books.
<Zohrd> eat the kid, yea
<Ninosmr> SPIN DA RCORD BOI
<Blazing_Beatz> God, Everyone is stupid

<pony_3045> she just want a making friend!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> How many more people died in the book?
<`Xenu> butt

<Sundaysmile> scavenger also implies eating anything smaller than you
<Paquack> Well that throws the whole motion theory out the window. >_>
<Mejzen> OMG IT'S SPIKE OWO

<LordDerpington> alexxm: Not yet
<PONY> oh shi-
<T-Rex1013> twixie_sprinkle hate on the people who gave the dinosaurs thier hunting instincts, not the underage kids who have to suffer
<Angeling> Fat guy hasnt died yet
<Vordox> <-----The Tyrannosaurus' roars were a combination of dog, penguin, tiger, alligator, and elephant sounds.
<Sundaysmile> HUGZ
<Blazing_Beatz> And he left the boy under the car, IDIOT
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Did anyone die less or differently in the Book?

<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[R], Hammond got eaten by a group of those small carnivors right at the end. I think that is different in the movie
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Why did the t-rex shove the car off the ledge?
<Dark_Horst> Jageman: think about it. this thing's body is built for the sole purpose of sprinting
<SirGanjalf> Ohai Samuel L. Jackson. Already back from VGAs?
<Dark_Horst> Jageman: a scavenger wouldnt need to do tha

<SirGanjalf> A meme before Internet...
<Sips_> VenHur: That game was amazing
<Meanwhile> Warning, objects in mirror are closer than they appear.
<Azuredragon> I herd of ordering your meal to go but this is ridiculous
<Blazing_Beatz> "GAME OVER YEAHHHHH
<VenHur> Now if only the actors were badasses to actually DO that in the movie.
<Kencolt> In the novel, Iam spent most of this part whacked out on morphine-- because of pain-- and babbling scraps of wierd science and philosophy... which helped explain the plot. ^_^
<`Xenu> Save Point
<Dark_Horst> Jageman: huge monitor lizard. lives only on the komodo islands. nasty bite
<Combustiblelemons> warning- objects in mirror are faker than they appear.
<Trollestia> FRANCIS
<PONY> That's the type of fast food they should serve in the US.

<pony_4908> Perfect timing
<Iwa> Combustiblelemons: It can be if the idiot programmer made the UI look like that...But yeah, in general it does not :P
<Aylnine> she made the crazy eyes

<Sebiale> twixie_sprinkle: Srsly?

<red_ony> why the smirk
<Trollestia> twixie_sprinkle: WHY? That seems so stupid.
<Kencolt> twixie_sprinkle: HORRIBLE UI, looks to me.
<`Xenu> GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANT
<Michael> learn to aim noob
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, the file explorer exists for Unix, and probably Linux, maybe even Windows. It's useless for most purposes, and who ever said she was hacking?
<CriticKitten> Iwa/Combustiblelemons: That interface is real.
<Aylnine> Raptor don't need no ladder
<Blazing_Beatz> SAMUEL JACKSON DIED BY THE DINOSAUR.....WHAT KIND OF MOVE IS THIS
<T-Rex1013> NYEH
<pony_4908> Dat irony
<Vordoxensaurus> <--- LOOK AT LEX'S FACE
<Aylnine> Raptor don't give a f-
<Sundaysmile> that's a nice effect
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: She did?
<Sebiale> He was yelling "grant"? I could never understand it.
<pony_3045> awkward moment that they even haven't good network to controll whatever
<Iwa> CriticKitten: Exactly why I wasn't refuting it to be false :)
<Sumica> 00,104 shots heard 4 casses on ground, 3 holes in glass
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What did he yell?
<T-Rex1013> DEATH BY DINOSAUR = COOLEST WAY TO DIE
<`Xenu> TEXTRAPTOR
<Anaruski> damn lag....
<Combustiblelemons> CriticKitten: MFW: 6_9
<EspyLacopa> That DNA code
<Sebiale> Oh goody, Velociraptor pelvis, just what I wanted to see today.
<DRHUnleashed> ATCGTAGCTAGATGAACAGT
<BlitzWing00> Shotguns don't shoot bullets.
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> I've had it with those motherfuckin' dinosaurs on this motherfuckin' island!
<LordDerpington> Oh, this was the scene where the stunt performer looked at the camera, so they stuck Lex's face on digitally to cover it up.
<Angeling> Boot to the FACE!
<`Xenu> ow
<pony_4908> SuperBrony64: Either "GRAAAANT" or "DEAUGH"
<EspyLacopa> boot to the head!
<Trollestia> T-Rex1013: DEATH BY DINOSAUR = |BEST| WAY TO DIE
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Could've missed the window? :D
<red_ony> raport knocked out by little girl
<Sundaysmile> it's a shotgun - a gun which fires shots
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Who is Grant?
<Kencolt> Another victory for sensible shoes.
<Angeling> Missed the drumstick!
<Meanwhile> Quick, kick it in the teeth.
<Bronysith> but
<CCharmanderK> Almost time for THE LOTTERY!! :)
<Bronysith> sexy
<LordDerpington> SuperBrony64: Sam Neill's character.
<Meanwhile> Super you fail at following this movie.
<T-Rex1013> IVE HEARD SUFFACTION IS THE MOST PLEASANT WAY TO DIE
<pony_4908> SuperBrony64: The scientist/main character?
<Kandarihu> Just because she claims to be a hacker near the beginning and simply opens a program near the end of the movie. That's no hacking.
<Sumica> 00,10also tiny holes for a 12 gage firng slugs
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> YES! Scare them with a dead guy!
<T-Rex1013> STOP WALKING ON MAH BONES
<TrixieMuffin> What was that raptor standing on to lift the panel if there was nothing underneath ?
<Vordoxensaurus> <-- Fun Trivia here: In the original script, the T-Rex skeleton in the lobby was hooked up to pulleys like a giant marionette. In the ending, Grant was going to man the controls and act as puppeteer, using the skeleton's head and feet to crush the raptors.
<Sundaysmile> you spin me right round
<EspyLacopa> Time for a big damn hero moment!
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> Grandpa? Noooooo!
<RaveBrony> Now with ponies, theres no such thing as sexy :D
<Azuredragon> Trollestia, THIS is the best way to die, http://radbot.net/?i=3675
<Bronysith> yes
<LordDerpington> Damn, that would have been a stupid ending.
<Bronysith> yes tehre is
<Bronysith> need i link?>
<RainbowAsh> Spinning spinning
<Combustiblelemons> dinosaurs have no respect for the dead.
<RaveBrony> Nope :D
<Meanwhile> Vordoxensaurus: That would have been really fucking dumb.
<pony_4908> Meanwhile: Agreed. XD
<Paquack> Dinosaur: No, my twin brother!
<Kandarihu> Vordoxensaurus, that sounds like it would've been awesome.
<Vordoxensaurus> Meanwhile: The ending where the T-Rex saves the day was added when Steven Spielberg decided that it was the hero of the film.
<Combustiblelemons> and your legs remain unbroken.
<Trollestia> Azuredragon: Okay, I was way fucking wrong. If I was in that situation, I would literally just enjoy that.
<Combustiblelemons> what.
<Michael> damn immortal kid
<red_ony> this is some bad construction
<Blazing_Beatz> HOW COME THAT BOY NEVER DIES
<Lindeman> Raep time
<RainbowAsh> Blazing_Beatz, plot armor
<RaveBrony> I know in this type of convo I cant beat you, hahaha
<Combustiblelemons> kinda weird isn't it.
<T-Rex1013> AND THEN I MAKE ANOTHER APPEARENCE
<Angeling> NOW DIEEEE
<PterodacJoe11> Azuredragon: I would LOVE to die like that. IF I have to die by non-natural causes
<PONY> kids dont die in a spielberg movie

*thelonevelociraptor attack Noms on T-Rex1013 >:3
<red_ony> fuck you t-rex
<Dark_Horst> really like how he had a shotgun and didnt hit a single one
<Meanwhile> Convenient. How did that thing even fucking get in there.
<Combustiblelemons> HOW DID IT GET IN THERE?
<Michael> T-rex to the rescue
<Dark_Horst> now t-rex is good guy or wat?
<Alchemist> Its not like its so inconspicous
<Stellafera> To the Rexue!
<VenHur> SuperBrony64: I remember him!
<Sumica> 00,10trex has 100 in sneak

<Meanwhile> Dat lob.
<`Xenu> RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> :O
<Dark_Horst> ....why didnt he eat it
<EspyLacopa> You know, what they should do is a re-release of this movie, only told from the point of view of the Raptors. All the dinos can talk, and you never hear the humans talk.
<pony_4908> red_ony: They must've cut that to leave room for sequels. XD
<wipergone2> k,
<wipergone2> lol
<Vordoxensaurus> urass park
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> RAWR:[
<RaveBrony> I can appreciate the art. But think nothing of it :I
<RainbowAsh> Dark_Horst, you gotta tenderize your meat first
<Angeling> Now nuke the island until we re-create Godzilla~!
<red_ony> :D
<Sebiale> That was such a tyrannosaurus ex machina!
<SweetieG4K> :'(
<Trollestia> Noooo, not the executive bathroom :(
<Bronysith> you wont be thinking of it
<Blazing_Beatz> TIme to Nuke the Park
<`Xenu> T____T
<Sundaysmile> this was one of my ultimate nostalgia movies. glad to see it again
<Bronysith> for you will be fappign
<Nittany_Discord> Where's Samuel L. Jackson?
<pony_4908> EspyLacopa: We may have lost this battle, but the war isn't over!
<Anaruski> yay, then they go home and nuke the island....
<weeping_pegasi82> dead
<PterodacJoe11> Nittany_Discord: ded
<Meanwhile> He got eaten by a raptor off screen Nitt.
<Sundaysmile> samuel got eated
<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: raptor snack
<Combustiblelemons> jurrassic park sequels were bad.
<Aylnine> now I have only you, mosquito
<Combustiblelemons> very bad.
<Nittany_Discord> Forgot how he died.
<BlitzWing00> He's looking for his arm
<RainbowAsh> Hammond got eaten alive by the same dinosaurs that killed the fat guy earlier in the book.
<`Xenu> T____T
<Nittany_Discord> Been so long since I saw this.
<pony_4908> "LET'S ADOPT THEM"
<ChaosTheorySurge> RaveBrony: I agree on ponies not being sexy :D
<Sumica> 00,10smash the stick so he cant rebuild the evil
<Blazing_Beatz> Nittany_Discord: He Died off screen, that or he is riding a Dinosaur
<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: we didnt see it, but the woman found his arkm
<Dark_Horst> *arm
<twixie_sprinkle> little do they know, the aliens already implanted a child in the little girl
<DaringDerpy> hello :)
<VenHur> And he's all like "The fuck have I doned?"
<Buytoast> meh, the episode was eh
<RaveBrony> \o/
<EspyLacopa> First time I saw this movie, I was disappointed that the chaos math guy didn't die.
<Nittany_Discord> Oh, I remember that. OK.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Livestream Saturdays
<Vordoxensaurus> Wrek: With every new draft of the script, there was a different set of survivors and a different set of characters dying. At various points during pre-production, Hammond, Malcolm, and Dr. Wu were going to die and Gennaro and Muldoon were going to live.
<red_ony> they could still open that park...considering only the handfull of people died
<PONY> Now think about all the legal mess the old man has to go through now.
<Aylnine> BIRD
<Blazing_Beatz> Samuel Jackson Died....how is that possible
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya DaringDerpy :)
<T-Rex1013> Angeling Godzilla or Zilla? Cuz if youre going by that origin, Godzilla would have to be mutated frrom a Godzillasuarus, otherwise we'd get Zilla, the amercain godzilla who was renamed by Toho because it didnt deserve the word God in its name
<Dark_Horst> great. all alive and happy. now nuke the damn island
<Combustiblelemons> more people die in carnivals than jurrassic park
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> Little do they, that dino sneeze infected them with a deatly virus...
<RainbowAsh> Vordoxensaurus, why didn't they stick to the book?
<Meanwhile> Now there's just a random island covered in dinosaurs in the middle of the ocean. I'm sure that'll never go wrong.
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> *know
<DaringDerpy> they could sell it as the best and most dangerous safari on earth
<RaveBrony> Ive grown content with 'That' side of the fandom.... but i just despise how sooo many of my friends I made when i first came here turned to that side...
<Vordoxensaurus> RainbowAsh: Screenplay
<Michael> the only dinosaurs who survived...
<pony_4908> Dark_Horst: But then they can't make money off of a sequel!
<DaringDerpy> hi MLP_Brovakiin :)
<red_ony> I really wish they killed some main characters
<Combustiblelemons> meanwhile - how wrong you'd be.
<Angeling> Who cares!? I want some giant atomic breath lizards!
<red_ony> It never even felt tense
<Vordoxensaurus> Red_M: They did. :P
<misteriks> great film
<BlitzWing00> I'm more surprised Samuel L Jackson wasn't playing his "Angry Black Guy" character.
<Blazing_Beatz> AND SUDDENLY: NUKE
<pony_4908> red_ony: What're you talking about? Mr. Arnold was the star! D':
<Michael> damn i love this music
<pikorar> Now it's time for them to go back... TO THE FUUUUTUUUUURE!
<T-Rex1013> JURASSIC PARK 4: DIRECTED BY MICHAEL BAY
<Sumica> 00,10the realy silly thing is hammon dies in the first book
<PterodacJoe11> JP 2 and 3 are set on different Islands.
<wipergone2> 1000/10
<Kandarihu> T-Rex1013, I never knew that about... Zilla
<Starlight_Phoenix> in the Jurassic Park 2 do they come back to this island?
<Sumica> 00,10and comes back in the second
<Meanwhile> Combustiblelemons: What could possibly happen. It's not like they'll decide to go back there or, pfft, bring a dinosaur back. How silly would that be?
<VenHur> And then the once great standalone movie was ruined by The Lost World.
<Alchemist> john williams?
<red_ony> pony_4908: who?
<Vordoxensaurus> Holy fäcking shit, it's a dinosaur, jesis christ, what the f'äääck
<Angeling> and now im off to sleep.. 5 am over here
<Nittany_Discord> No. Different island.
<Angeling> cyas
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guys.. what if we watched joe grizzly
<PterodacJoe11> Full Points 10/10
<RainbowAsh> Starlight_Phoenix, no, they come up with more islands out of nowhere
<aniderp|bestcakeever> from halloween 2 xD
<T-Rex1013> Kandarihu I know my Godzilla. :)
<pony_4908> red_ony: Black guy. "Hold onto your butts."
<VenHur> And then an "Mm'kay" 3rd movie.
<Kencolt> In the original novel, it's implied that Malcom dies. In the sequel novel, Malcolm is shown to have lived-- but to have had his profesional life ruined by the experience.
<Combustiblelemons> IKR meanwhile, what flawed logic would that be.
<Vordoxensaurus> FUN TRIVIA Alt: In the original script, Gennaro and Malcolm were combined into one character, and Muldoon survived in the end. In the original book, Gennaro and Muldoon both survived, and Hammond and Malcolm died (though Malcolm returned in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, explaining that "doctors did excellent work").
<misteriks> 1:01 and i didnt go to sleep )
<SuperBrony64> 11,02They based a book off the movie?
<Combustiblelemons> *pauses to think*
<Blazing_Beatz> Lol, 3rd movie has the Plane crash on the island
<Combustiblelemons> oh yeah, humans are stupid.
<pony_4908> SuperBrony64: Totally.
<EspyLacopa> I remember reading Lost World (the sequal), and how part of the first part of the book was simply -finding- the other island.
<Combustiblelemons> never mind, dinosaur apocalypse.
<Kencolt> SuperBrony64: Quite the opposite.
<red_ony> SuperBrony64: yeah...i had that as a kid..it had pictures an everything
<Cajun> Book came first. They bought the rights before it was finished tho
<T-Rex1013> VenHur I like the 3rd film the best, because it gave me what I wanted from a Dinosaur movie; Dinosaurs fighting others dinosaurs, and humans being hunted by said dinosaurs
<Stellafera> John Williams is a boss
<Bronysith> quick question
<Combustiblelemons> dinosaur apocalypse or zombie apocalypse. you choose.
<Bronysith> anyone else hate baby mario?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<VenHur> This is an wonderful classic groundbreaking movie, too bad it was ruined by The Lost World... >->
<Alchemist> zombie apocalypse is way cooler
<Vordoxensaurus> SuperBrony64: The novel was published in 1990. However, pre-production of the film began in 1989, using only Michael Crichton's manuscript. It was widely believed that the book would be such a hit that it would make an outstanding movie. It turns out that assumption was correct.
<RainbowAsh> Combustiblelemons, I'd prefer dino apocalypse
<Bronysith> from you know
<PterodacJoe11> Zombie. Higher chance of survival
<Kotano> Combustiblelemons: Why not both?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Zombie apocalypse
<Bronysith> yoshis island
<T-Rex1013> Zombie, becaue it all the zombies woulod be dead in about a year
<pony_1390> Dinosaur Apocalypse
<aniderp|bestcakeever> is the raffle now?
<Blazing_Beatz> Zomvies
<RaveBrony> I didnt play mario, so i wouldnt know :I
<Buytoast> only when he's crying
<DRHUnleashed> Zombiesaur apocalypse
<T-Rex1013> ^
<Kotano> Zombies, easier to kill
<Nittany_Discord> Can't I pick asteroid or comet?
<Michael> dinosaur apocalypse
<Vordoxensaurus> ...
<Vordoxensaurus> holy shit...
<Combustiblelemons> kotano: http://t.qkme.me/35psf0.jpg
<pony_1390> more challenge that way.
<Vordoxensaurus> Dinozombies
<Vordoxensaurus> HOLY SHIT
<T-Rex1013> Robot Apocalyse has already started
<Combustiblelemons> you win kotano.
<Nittany_Discord> Or Yellowstone supereruption?
<VenHur> Now...If Hollywood WANT to make a reboot of the original movie like they doned with The Amazing Spider Man, here's a few things...
<Vordoxensaurus> Nittany_Discord: Dat 2012
<CCharmanderK> ILM!!
<Alchemist> how about an epidemic apocalypse
<VenHur> 1: Let Timmy be killed! MWHAHAHAHAHAHAH!
<Sundaysmile> I'm tired of hollywood remaking anything....
<CCharmanderK> John Williams is the man.
<Vordoxensaurus> Alchemist: Already happened, check "The Last of us"
<Combustiblelemons> i doubt yellowstone will erupt any time soon
<thelonevelociraptor> naw, never played that game
<Nittany_Discord> It won't at least in the short-term.
<Combustiblelemons> scientists say they could be off by 100 million years.
<VenHur> And 2: Don't let the human run away, make them have guns and riffles and kick some dinosaur asses!
<cowvarkian> >.>
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Combustiblelemons> or was it 100,000.... :P
<ChaosTheorySurge> Well, apparently people in the playtesting team were ignoring him because his cries weren't annoying enough
<T-Rex1013> VenHur one does not simply hunt a dinosaur
<Vordoxensaurus> WHAT IF DINOSAUR EXISTED IN EQUESTRIA?!
<Kencolt> VenHur: You kind of miss the point of the movie here.
<Vordoxensaurus> Best episode idea
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> Choose your own apocalypse: http://local-static1.forum-files.fobby.net/forum_attachments/0014/9036/OH_GOD_.jpg
<Sundaysmile> Vordoxen - they have DRAGONS
<Kotano> Vordoxensaurus: They aready got dragons.
<Michael> VenHur: one does not simply become turok
<Kotano> *already
<RainbowAsh> Vordoxensaurus, Fluttershy would be the unquestioned ruler
<Starlight_Phoenix> SO...... Jurassic Park 4. Would any of you watch it?
<Sundaysmile> kinda worse than dinosaurs
<Nittany_Discord> Based off of a three-eruption cycle, Yellowstone is overdue to erupt, but I don't trust most natural cycles.
<pony_4908> Guys, Jurassic Park IV is official slated to release within the next two years! :D
<VenHur> Kencolt: Well...yeah...you're right...LESSON LEARNED...
<Vordoxensaurus> Dragons...
<T-Rex1013> I WOULD THE FUCK OUT OF JURASSIC PARK 4
<Vordoxensaurus> close nuff
<Combustiblelemons> dinosaurs would mean evolution, which would mean a time before the sun and the moon could rise.
<EspyLacopa> RaveBrony: http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/120/d/e/fluttershy_3d_by_shepherd0821-d4y1ubj.gif
<RaveBrony> My first games were Spyro, Tiny Tank, and Diablo :3
<VenHur> pony_4908: It BETTER be as good as the first one...
<RainbowAsh> Starlight_Phoenix, the sequels got more and more awful. So I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole
<RaveBrony> EspyLacopa: Wha??
<Combustiblelemons> damn... how was there life on their planet when they control the sun and moon?
<Starlight_Phoenix> Yeah...
<Combustiblelemons> wouldn't that mean they were always there?
<T-Rex1013> I WOULD THE FUCK OUT OF JURASSIC PARK 4
<Sundaysmile> probably
<Combustiblelemons> damn creationists.
<VenHur> And hopefully not as crappy as The Lost World: Jurassic Park...
<ChaosTheorySurge> RaveBrony: my first games were in the arcade :)
<Vordoxensaurus> I love the idea...
<Sundaysmile> unless they "fine tuned" it
<thelonevelociraptor> My first game was Mario 64
<Vordoxensaurus> of T-Rex Ninja Robot
<Vordoxensaurus> :D
<EspyLacopa> Got randomly linked it in another channel.
<Vordoxensaurus> OH WAIT
<T-Rex1013> ITS A FUCKING BIG BLOCKBUSTER FILM ABOUT DINOSAURS, ITLL BE GOOD NO MATTER WHAT
<Sundaysmile> suited to pony needs
<Blazing_Beatz> I say buck it, and continuing with the portal to Equestria
<Vordoxensaurus> Already exists!
<RaveBrony> Ah, lol
<wipergone2> thx
<Kencolt> VenHur: Nope. Hollywood. Large corpoation in the movie which hollywood hates-- hates all corprations that aren't part of hollywood. Thus, corporation bucks up again, CF. Jurassic Park 2.
<Starlight_Phoenix> Has bronystate shown the lost world or jurassic park 3?
<Sundaysmile> probably yeah
<VenHur> Meh, I don't know...
<Trollestia> I don't see why they wouldn't have, Starlight_Phoenix.
<T-Rex1013> Lost World is the worst of the JP films
<RaveBrony> Those things are so strange :D
<Trollestia> :D
<pony_4908> When's the poll/lottery/thing going to be up?
<RaveBrony> The whole 3d-ish effect
<Paquack> JP2 needed more Jeff Goldblum
<Trollestia> Time for singing!
<ChaosTheorySurge> And now, PONIES! :D
<Sundaysmile> wasn't there a fourth one or am I just high?
<PterodacJoe11> About new Episode: I was surprised that Luna didn't steal the show and make everypony go crazy over her and ignore Scootaloo.

<Punkie_Pue> how do i subscribe? Is there a link?
<lala> i was just in time!
<Buytoast> 10/10 for yellow quiet saving the day
<T-Rex1013> ask a mod
<Combustiblelemons> AJ is underrated i think :/
<Stellafera> Hi Season 1 opening
<Aylnine> I love AJ
<RaveBrony> I wish the Trixie ep was a 2 parter.... it was so rushed :(
<Sebiale> Objects in Equestria must age preternaturally fast for that thing to have fallen apart after only a few years . . .
<Punkie_Pue> Thanks.
<Stellafera> I think AJ is the best pony
<Combustiblelemons> 3rd favourite pony.
<Sundaysmile> there was an email link on the website Punkie
<lala> Whos excited?
<Alchemist> Punkie_Pue: ask a mod about it, they will set you up
<Sundaysmile> not sure if it's still there though
<d3rb> aj is best pony, no doubt
<BlitzWing00> Season 1 opener feels so odd to me, feels like so long ago.
<Bronysith> the whole episode
<Bronysith> was just fanfiction
<Bronysith> and fanservice
<Punkie_Pue> Cool, thanks.
<RaveBrony> Haha
<Paquack> Combustiblelemons: DikeKike is to this day one of my favorites.
<lala> wait
<NeoChap> Scootaloo has been scooting alot as you can see.
<Bronysith> thats it
<lala> ive already seen this D:
<pony_4908> Wait, you have to contact a mod, or can you just wait for the newsletter?
<Combustiblelemons> him and cs188 go down in my favourites Paquack
<Michael> slow motion
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> And here we can see rare velociscooter
<Anaruski> b movie is due after this episode?
<RaveBrony> Meh
<ChaosTheorySurge> I thought all episode until now were pretty cool and well done. There, I said it, now yell at me
<lala> Dang.
<Stellafera> I've seen this scooter riding clip used so much for PMVs
<aniderp|bestcakeever> raffle after this?
<lala> Bye guys.
<d3rb> Anaruski, yep
<Sundaysmile> ads?
<Aylnine> Apple Bloom is going to become a carpenter?
<DaringDerpy> Anaruski: yes
<Alchemist> cutie mark niggers
<d3rb> bye lala
<Sundaysmile> ah right
<Combustiblelemons> foreshadowing into their cutie marks
<misteriks> so i'm gonna to do a coffee for me )
<Stellafera> All I can hear here is the FIW version
<Combustiblelemons> never stop the church!
<Sebiale> How did Applebloom not get her cutie mark after doing all that?
<Kotano> Whenever I'm feeling down...
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> kewl!
<Kotano> yep,only hearing Sweetiebot
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat voice
<Aylnine> she has to clean an entire mansion for that to happen Sebiale
<FlaschenJoe11> I liked all episodes until now.
<Stellafera> I love this person
<Stellafera> Part
<Vordoxensaurus> TREX IN SPACE
<Vordoxensaurus> http://www.thatguys.co.uk/uploaded_images/dino-crisis-3-745699.jpg
<pony_4908> Sebiale: They have to be conscious of their talents. They were just doing that for fun, plus they're blinded by their 'quest'.
<Alchemist> Sebiale: I guess you have to realize what your passion is
<Combustiblelemons> scootaloo gets a good voice in s3... wat.
<Blazing_Beatz> Scootaloo's singing improved since this episode
<weeping_pegasi82> A LOT
<Sebiale> Twilight Sparkle never realized magic was her talent, Celestia had to point it out.
<Bronysith> holy shit
<Paquack> Cutie Mark...Acquisition Program!
<Aylnine> Apple Bloom's name doesn't seem to match her "talent"
<Bronysith> fluttershy pulled a shinji
<alexxm> no meal uncooked?
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> no stone unturned
<Kandarihu> I'm honestly not sure if construction should be Apple Bloom's talent. But Scootaloo seems to be very good at propelling her scooter with her wings and Sweetie Belle is very good at singing and song composition.
<Blazing_Beatz> DIS SONG
<MadSurge> Eh?
<FlaschenJoe11> when exactly?
<Pinkies4thWall> THIS SONG
<Bronysith> in the trixie episode
<Combustiblelemons> seems like the farm ALWAYS has apples to pick
<Stellafera> Twilight got her cutie mark I think while the princess talked to her
<Sebiale> But you don't pick apples, you buck them . . .
<T-Rex1013> Carpentry is probably AB talent
<Combustiblelemons> perpetual applepicking.
<Bronysith> she fucking pulled a shinji
<Bronysith> Whines
<Bronysith> complains
<Aylnine> well they did try to make a chair/table that one time...
<Bronysith> doesnt want to do shit
<CCharmanderK> SCOOTAQUEST
<RainbowAsh> Sebiale, the apples get picked by bucking
<Trollestia> GAK IS BACK!!
<Punkie_Pue> That machine is very dangerous.
<Bronysith> and then saves teh day
<weeping_pegasi82> oh no
<Stellafera> Ayline, the other two messed it up
<Sundaysmile> rainbow taffy
<Trollestia> Punkie_Pue: Yuo have no idea
<Cajun> No, they're being ground into rainbows
<Kencolt> Stellafera: After she went an umexpecedly powerful magical surge at an extraordinarily late age, yes.
<Michael> rainbow
<Aylnine> it turns ponies into rainbow taffy
<MadSurge> And yet saves the day because she actually does shit
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Trollestia> DAT CRY
<Combustiblelemons> Trollestia: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xxg9unq3Kx4/UD-PYI0c8sI/AAAAAAAABDk/D6QPUTEE0iA/s1600/GTFO.png
<EspyLacopa> I wonder if Rainbow Taffy would be spicy.
<Combustiblelemons> for the gak.
<RaveBrony> Eps 1&2 - a great start with the characters personalities (but the villian sucked), Pinkie ep - Over the Top awesome, Bully ep - Pretty good, but was rather dull, Trixie ep - Fun but rushed, Newest ep - Fun and sweet
<MadSurge> Her birds only accellerated the process
<Trollestia> Combustiblelemons: IT. IS. ON.
<Michael> lol
<PONY> dat baby cry
<Aylnine> maybe Apple Bloom is good at raising barns
<Stellafera> Why did Rarity allow this?
<RaveBrony> There are my opinions, lol
<Bronysith> AKA Misato
<Combustiblelemons> why did i get kicked and you didn't? D:
<alexxm> Stellafera who says she did
<RainbowAsh> Stellafera she was asleep
<Trollestia> Combustiblelemons: http://i.imgur.com/88Pyv.png
<Kencolt> Rarity didn't. That's Aloe and Lufa's place.
<Kotano> aww, no shocks?
<PONY> dum
<Combustiblelemons> frustrated twi?
<Bronysith> misato accelerated the process
<Trollestia> Combustiblelemons: I have nothing more at the moment.
<Aylnine> those bottoms
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: we're not too far in our opinions :)
<Combustiblelemons> indeed.
<Buytoast> shit when did they put bats in minecraft
<Bronysith> and Fluttershy was a shinji
<Bronysith> AHHAHA
<Kandarihu> Nope. No precognition
<Buytoast> scared the hell outta me
<RaveBrony> MadSurge: :$
<Combustiblelemons> and well, it's good enough for me trollestia :3
<Buytoast> did someone say...
<Sundaysmile> snorkels do not work that way
<Buytoast> OPINIONS?
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Azuredragon> Shoo be doo, shoo shoo be doo
<Buytoast> you know those aren't allowed
<RawketLawnchair> that's some pretty localized weather.
<Ryunosuke> ...
<Combustiblelemons> no sea ponies.
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: I think Sombra might make a return
<DaringDerpy> saddle bag bug?
<Sebiale> What a strange meteorological phenomena . . .
<Buytoast> unless you share mine
<Combustiblelemons> well they do control it RawketLawnchair
<RaveBrony> Twi is taller than Cheerilee?
<Stellafera> Haha Spike
<Trollestia> http://tinyurl.com/7q6ho9p
<Bronysith> cheerilee is sexy as well
<Paquack> You had one job, Spike. ONE JOB!
<RaveBrony> So youve said :D
<Trollestia> Combustiblelemons: Check that shit
<Kandarihu> Frankly, I have a feeling that the Cutie Mark Crusaders are holding each other back. They might have a better chance of finding their cutie marks individually instead of collectively.
<Buytoast> but horses aren't sexy
<Trollestia> Kandarihu: SHUT UP IT'S CUTE WHEN THEY DO IT TOGETHER
<Buytoast> they're horses
<RaveBrony> ^
<Pinkies4thWall> dat title drop
<MadSurge> How do you define taller in horse world? I'd say bigger
<Trollestia> Pinkies4thWall: I KNOW I HATE IT WHEN THEY DO THAT
<RaveBrony> MadSurge: Meh maybe :P
<Combustiblelemons> titledrop.
<Aylnine> Yeah! *squeak*
<RainbowAsh> Kandarihu, Apple Bloom sucked plenty at finding her talent on her own.
<Michael> dat titledrop
<One> Yay Rarity!
<RaveBrony> Maybe it was ust Twi's hair, lol
<RaveBrony> *just
<Bronysith> time to post suggestive pics
<Kandarihu> The CMC drive Twilight Sparkle to Title Drop
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: with a better motive, I mean :D
<Trollestia> RainbowAsh: We're talking about Scoots and Sweetie.
<Combustiblelemons> roommate is riiiight behind me :S
<Sebiale> Suddenly, Cutie Marks in thievery.
<RaveBrony> Yeah:P
<Punkie_Pue> Where is the exaust sound coming from?
<Aylnine> yoga mats
<Bronysith> http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/37456888829
<Stellafera> Wow, I didn't know that there was this dynamic before Sisterhooves Social
<Michael> they stealed rarity
<PONY> so... which ones of you became crayon specialists? Since I'm pretty sure quite a lot of you enjoyed crayons as a kid.
<twixie_sprinkle> Sebiale: grand theft cutie marks
<RaveBrony> They couldve done better on his design tho :(
<RainbowAsh> Punkie_Pue, from her wings, somehow
<Bronysith> http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/37123459118
<Iwa> Combustiblelemons: Offer him/her a chair :)
<Paquack> Punkie_Pue: Scootaloo's flutters?
<Combustiblelemons> he hates mlp :L
<Punkie_Pue> I didn't notice lol
*RaveBrony reads the site name
<Bronysith> i still think sombra is more villainy than chrysallis
<RaveBrony> Nope
<Stellafera> I really do not remember most of this episode
<Bronysith> cause Conquest isnt really villainy
<Michael> ghost and goblins
<Sebiale> Scared, Spike, definitely scared.
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute, are Apple Bloom and Sweetie Bell sitting Lyra-style?
<Aylnine> dat wobble sound effect
<Trollestia> Combustiblelemons: Hey, Combustiblelemons' roommate! Your roommate watches Poooonies! PONIES!
<Bronysith> her kingdom needed to survive so one has to fall
<Combustiblelemons> he's watched an episode of it, that's all i'll ask him to do.

<RaveBrony> Ew

<Trollestia> ROCK ONNNNNNNNNNNN
<Aylnine> I wonder if Scootaloo's VA is also similarly vocally challenged
<Stellafera> You can actually hear a laugh at one point when there's a fan
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/1eb7de70c8960469e282d6a070233f84.png THESE ARE HUMANS
<Kandarihu> I'd like to go on a bit of a crack theory that at one point, Sweet Apple Acres is seriously damaged by a disaster, and Apple Bloom plants new apple trees to replace the lost ones, so her cutie mark appears as a tree.
<Trollestia> WE ARE THE CUTIE MARK CRUS AAA DERS
<Haku1013> Nyeh

<MadSurge> cowvarkian: well apparently someone else here is not getting the message :D
<Combustiblelemons> it's something.
<Aylnine> mkay
<RainbowAsh> Combustiblelemons roommate: Welcome to the herd

<Kandarihu> C'mon guys! We wanna know what we're watching next weekend!

<Haku1013> So what do you guys wantto see as Next Weeks A Film?
<Stellafera> Ragnar's ancient era theme in Civ 4 is epic
<Kandarihu> Derpingtons, you do realize why the new intermission video is 10 minutes longer than the old one, right?
<EspyLacopa> Haku1013: Grave of the Fireflies

<Socks> pony_pony: I;ve been here for months and even I don't know :D
<VenHur> HE stole the popcorn!
<Derpingtons> Yeah.
*Michael makes chocolate popcorn
<cowvarkian> thats a filter?
<Combustiblelemons> I miss the days when we were randomly selected from chat to choose the movie
<cowvarkian> just thought it was a bad camera
<Derpingtons> I think.
<Dark92Enigma-> Shizuka, Sumica, Saturn, SuperBrony64, tom, +Phase4 anypony! I don't mean to startle you or anything :( but it's lottery time
<CCharmanderK> EspyLacopa: Fantastic movie, but it was too painful to watch the first time. So no.

<Bronysith> ugh
<Gilda> So apparently Princess Luna can pull a Freddie Kreuger when ever she wants to.
<Kandarihu> I wonder... maybe they're having setbacks in getting the spreadsheet ready. That's the only possible reason I can think of that the lottery didn't start 6 minutes ago.
<Yellowquiet> shoo be doo bee do shee bee doo
<Combustiblelemons> i won a pony episode once in my history of being with bronystate

<otakon17> Shizuka is pleased :P
<prince-dari> Mars Attacks is total B
<muukalainen> what are u doing ops? some contest?
<Pinkies4thWall> :P MLP_Brovakiin
<MadSurge> Yay, Mars Attacks! <3
<CosmicLatte> How is a movie about a hedgehog crude..?
<Saturn> 08,01too crude? too crude?!
<Bronysith> shes going to celebrate with asuka
<Blazing_Beatz> I was relieved...I didnt want to see some Polish Movie
<MLP_Brovakiin> :3
<Nittany_Discord> Don't spam, please.
<VenHur> Err, which mod was it...?
<J_E_Smith71> Midnight_Fyre: But maybe the reviews make it B
<Trollestia> TIEM FOR RAT RACE
<Sumica> 00,10ah this week mya be saved yet
<Bronysith> if you know what i mean
<Socks> MARS ATTACKS! Yes! I haven't seen that film since I can't remember but it's so good!
<Yahooz> the proof is in the pudding: Less memes and memorable moments
<All_the_homestuck> DAS BULLSHIET
<Wrek> 05Midnight_Fyre: it is as good a B as it possibly gets
<Saturn> 08,01okay, it might be rather crude...
<Blazing_Beatz> OMG RAT RACE? YES
<otakon17> Okay so Gladiator, Mars Attacks and ponies
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> Mars Attacks? So much better
<Combustiblelemons> sounds like a good line up
<Saturn> 08,01but we've shown worse!
<otakon17> Sounds good
<AJIsAwesome> Yep, otakon17.
<VenHur> Hm...which mod like Mars Attacks...
<Combustiblelemons> i can't wait.
<Haku1013> Midnight_Fyre a B Film can be a low budget film, a bad film, a cult classis, or a very old film.
<VenHur> I forgot...
<All_the_homestuck> what the fuck is rat race
<Bronysith> otakon17: i enjoy gladiator
<otakon17> Okay then I'm out for now
<VenHur> I'm STILL thinking though....
<J_E_Smith71> Midnight_Fyre: I voted Home Alone 2, but they say it a B due to its mixed reviews
<Bronysith> otakon17: oh no you fucking dont
<Combustiblelemons> rat race is a good film i think
<Midnight_Fyre> J_ESmith71: It has good reviews though
<otakon17> Still at work and all
<Pinkies4thWall> MLP_Brovakiin: I do it again for good measure.
<Alchemist> a movie 70million budget is approved as a B movie but an israeli animated film with 1,5million gets placed in category A?
<otakon17> At
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> Saturn: Not only it's crude, but it's also boring, trust me
<Combustiblelemons> vaguely remember it

<Combustiblelemons> i remember the bronystate tradition of always doing pinkiequest before a stream
<Yahooz> yep
<Bjornfot> Give me a goodbye-kiss.
<Kandarihu> If reviews determined a movie's rankings, then my eternal choice for B Movie would all depend on what reviews they go by. IMDB hates it, RottenTomatoes love it.
<Blazing_Beatz> I <3 Rat Race!
<CosmicLatte> The fuck is this
<otakon17> No
<Combustiblelemons> tootspam.

<Dark92Enigma-> GOOOOOOOLDBEEEEEEEEERG
<Combustiblelemons> spot the brony.
<Kandarihu> I swear, there have been more movies pre-emptively WMC'd than WMC'd after the movie ran.
<All_the_homestuck> fuq yes
<Bronysith> so how are you going to celebrate Yahooz ?
<twixie_sprinkle> Combustiblelemons: who?
<J_E_Smith71> CosmicLatte: These are just the credits

<twixie_sprinkle> oh ok
<Wrek> 05calling it not B is not valid
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: better than having to decide after the fact
<All_the_homestuck> IF HE ISNT IN HERE JOHN WILL NOT BE HAPPY
<Bronysith> you're welcome
<J_E_Smith71> VenHur: You mean its the fat guy who got eaten by poison spitting dinosaurs
<PONY> Wrek, agreed.
<Saturn> 08,01wait wait wait
<weeping_pegasi82> wait music by John powell?
<Saturn> 08,01Mars Attacks

<IshRemorselessPony> ohai dere regulars
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: you're gonna explode in hapiness, right?
<Kandarihu> It's much better to ask for permission than to ask for forgiveness.
<twixie_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well deciding a movie is too crude isnt exactly the same as wmc
<cowvarkian> ohai
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, IshRemorselessPony.
<Yahooz> hey Ish

*Bjornfot glomps IshRemorselessPony
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: (insert Pinkie's friendship rocket)
<Bronysith> gladiator
<Paquack> My project for begging After Effects class ended up looking better than this movie's intro.
<CosmicLatte> Wait.. The Room isn't too crude to show, but a movie about a hedgehog is?
<Combustiblelemons> somehow the animation reminds me of gmod :S
<Saturn> 08,01Dark92Enigma-: i most certainly am not
<Kandarihu> twixie_sprinkle, in everything but name, we just witnessed another pre-emptive WMC.
<IshRemorselessPony> Bronysith aaaaaaaaand?

<Bronysith> gladiator
<Bronysith> i won with gladiator
<IshRemorselessPony> Gladiator and...
<Kotano> So, are there many movies with the same premise as Rat Race? There is of course "It's a mad(x4) world", and crazy race, the german rip-off. Anything else. Seems like you could do something like this every few years with a new cast of comedians...
<AJIsAwesome> IshRemorselessPony: A "Mars something" movie, if I recall.

<Havok> :<
<Trollestia> LIKELY STORY BRO

<Blazing_Beatz> KARMA
<Blazing_Beatz> AHAHAHA

<`Xenu> BEAN DANCE
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, they're being guilt-tripped into matching donations even though they never agreed to it.
<EspyLacopa> I can't hear this song without thinking of Shrek
<weeping_pegasi82> MR.BEAN/10
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> 8/10 - though the ending is kinda cheesy
<Vordoxensaurus> The family has forgiven the drug :D
<prince-dari> Kandarihu: Seriously? You're trying to go moral highground on giving money to charity...in a film?
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: fuck guilt

<Vordoxensaurus> Haku1013: The heart beated
<Trollestia> Thank you Prince_Lightstar
<pony_4908> Shoo-shoo-bee-doo
<Cajun> He fixed the heart
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons:even if he does it, it wouldn't wipe him out
<StarShimmer> Hello, can anyone tell me what was chosen in the lottery for next weekend? I couldn't catch it today. :)
<Nittany_Discord> greyname: Don't spam smileys, please.
<Sundaysmile> boooooo yeah yeah
<Kandarihu> pony_9118, and by that time, it's all been spent or funneled out of the country.
<Vordoxensaurus> Lucis!
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw8496-1352571980728507.jpg
<Combustiblelemons> he'd have to liquidize his assets though cowvarkian
<Trollestia> Bye all!
<Kencolt> Just back in time. the music wasn't singing to me, so I went to do a few things in Dalaran, and am just back in time for pony.
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: not all of them
<Sundaysmile> cya trollestia
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: not even near that
<Vordoxensaurus> prince-dari: Contender for Best Movie Clause? ;)
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> StarShimmer: Gladiator for A, and Mars Attacks! for B.
<Lindeman> What movie now?
<Combustiblelemons> a lot of them though that he probably spent most his life working for
<Kencolt> I meant the movie.
<Haku1013> Vordexensaurus thats a bad thing. The heart has to be frozen for the rest of the trip. And it only beat because of the momentary electricity that ran through it. The heart of no longer fit to be in a person.
<Sundaysmile> lindeman it's a pony ep now
<prince-dari> It's up there
<Sundaysmile> no more movie
<StarShimmer> Excellent! Thanks! :)
<Lindeman> PONEH TAIM!
<Vordoxensaurus> Haku1013: Overthinking it.^^
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute. Only 8 actresses were credited under the Lucies? They were superimposed over each other digitally!
<Sundaysmile> yes it's PONEH TAIM
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: he's a billionaire. implying multiple billions. so its not like he doesnt have money out the wazoo
<Haku1013> OVERTHINKING IS THE BEST THINKING
<ScootaChicken_> In regards to the masterpiece of a B movie that I picked:
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw8296-1350242255632981.jpg
<ScootaChicken_> [23:30:58] Dari: Apparently it's basically a furry porno
<ScootaChicken_> [23:32:44] Neil: All the more reason to stream it, I thought Bronies were into that sort of thing.
<Combustiblelemons> billionaire = 1+ billion.
<Vordoxensaurus> lawl ScootaChicken
<Combustiblelemons> so he could have like 1.4 billion
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, the only multi-billionaires are the likes of Bill Gates.
<Combustiblelemons> and lose half of it in charity
<pony_4908> a-ra-raaa
<Kencolt> Lindeman: Oh, before you ask-- the rest of the week is, depending on who if anyone is streaming, there's no TELLING what shows up. Just one word of advice, do NOT demand or plead for pony. Bad thing happen. Very bad things.
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: he's a fictional character, so blah
<Vordoxensaurus> DO NOT ASK FOR PONIES
<Combustiblelemons> exactly
<Vordoxensaurus> EVER
<Combustiblelemons> so why are we arguing XD
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: you started it
<J_E_Smith71> ALL THE LUCY COSPLAYERS/10
<desertman2> Kencolt: What if we want bad things? >_>
<Combustiblelemons> no u.
<pony_4908> Last night was full-on anime night when people asked for more ponies. :(
<prince-dari> Bill Gates isn't even the richest guy in the world
<Yahooz> ^
<Vordoxensaurus> desertman2: Don't piss of the other then
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, but still. One can't raise billions and billions of dollars just by running a casino.
<Combustiblelemons> who is?
<Blazing_Beatz> Well, this was fun....Rat Race is always an Enjoyable movie
<Haku1013> Kandarihu The guys who were paying were some of the richest people in the world. They could lose a few dozen millions and still be good to go.
<Cypresswolf> What were lotto results? Imissed them
<Lindeman> Kencolt: Someone said it was no more movies and it was pony time so...
<Combustiblelemons> gabe newells a billionaire i think
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> "Hitler's" speech/10
<Kencolt> desertman2: Then we all wind up finding very very hard tolove and tolerate you.
<Katalenic> lucys/10
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: its not like he wouldn't have more then one operation
<J_E_Smith71> Cypresswolf: Gladiator and Mars Attacks
<Vordoxensaurus> Lindeman: It is pony time
<Vordoxensaurus> Lindeman: A movie, Pony Ep, B Movie, Pony ep
<Yahooz> Lindeman: after the re-stream of the newest ep, no more ponies until next weel
<CCharmanderK> Time for some pony up in here!!!
<Yahooz> *week
<prince-dari> Kandarihu: Would you please for the love of God, stop being so damned selfrighteous
<Vordoxensaurus> Lindeman: And for today, an extra shwing of the latest EP
<Iwa> Combustiblelemons: He personally is, or is that the value of ValvE (which he has access to)?
<J_E_Smith71> Lindeman: Yep hour of ponies coming up next. Putting Your Hoof Down and new ep
<prince-dari> It's just a bloody film
<cowvarkian> thank you dabi
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw8050-you_just_went_full_brony.png
<Combustiblelemons> i'm not sure iwa
<Haku1013> welp, thats it for Haku. See ya later

<Kandarihu> Self-righteous? People were openly complaining about this ending last night.
<pony_4908> Prince_Lightstar: Story of our lives.
<CCharmanderK> ONLY ACTORS WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS FILM
<Kencolt> Lindeman: Yes. That's the only really scheduled time. BMN and EBMN. Any other time? Obscure anime. Strange fits of Bollywood. You might stumble in someone deciding to run the entire STAND miniseries. There's no telling, no predictionj-- although with experience you can make a guess.
<RainbowAsh> Prince_Lightstar, that sounds like the opposite of a problem
<Haku1013> Combustiblelemons They just said he was one of the richest people on Earth
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<Lindeman> Hello

<CCharmanderK> Fluttershy should NOT take that kind of shit from a fucking rabbit.
<Iwa> Combustiblelemons: ...Let's first run the galaxy, then we can see whether he will ever release a third installment of any Valve title :)
<Kencolt> RainbowAsh: That too. One consists mostly of tragic crashes and horrible loss of life.
<pony_4908> Dat Song of the South reference

<Kandarihu> Is that a Flugelhorn I heard?
<CCharmanderK> And then Bon Bon walks off with a stallion
<Blazing_Beatz> That looks like.....a Prissey Rainbow Dash
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw4881_medium.jpg
<CCharmanderK> And then she goes back to Lyra
<LordDerpington> The big has been doubled.
<cowvarkian> wait, where did you touch me > _ >
<Eli> i mean, who cuts in in the queue or rises teh prices just like that? that's something you just don't do...
<RainbowAsh> Blazing_Beatz, and she always dresses in style.
<Combustiblelemons> i'd flip a table and go hulk on those brats.

<twixie_sprinkle> Vordoxensaurus: no, those are just a reference to specific americans
<Bjornfot> I can't wait until teleportation is invented. Then we can have #bronystateregular orgies every movie night.
<Vordoxensaurus> twixie_sprinkle: "specific"?
<DinkyDoo> ONE BIT! TWO BITS!
<cowvarkian> oh you Bjornfot
<Lindeman> Mmm, vinyl

<SirGanjalf|Raptor> mindfuck'd
<CriticKitten> Being assertive = being manipulative
<iNTERGEN12> 7 BITS!
<cowvarkian> that'd be cool
<Yahooz> Bjornfot: even better, a time machine teleporter, so we can have #lobby orgies
<CCharmanderK> DERPY!!!

<Vordoxensaurus> Fluttershy....
<Kandarihu> They're called Valley Girls.
<Kencolt> And it's an episode I seriously dislike...
*Yahooz hugs Bjornfot
<Kencolt> BBL.
<CCharmanderK> WHY is EVERYPONY such ASSHOLES towards FLUTERSHY!!!
<Yahooz> its okay
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> He's like that desert mechanic... He even looks like him!
<Yahooz> its all okay
<LordDerpington> "Four? For this gourd?"
<Blazing_Beatz> Fluttershy!
<DinkyDoo> Fail.
<Bjornfot> Eli: you want MY dick? ;)
<RaveBrony> o_e
<cowvarkian> Bjornfot: sure
<SpadeKyurem[R]> This is why I hate Ponyville sometimes
<DinkyDoo> #DatFail
<Vordoxensaurus> twixie_sprinkle: Yeah, just saying. "Why" does USA have specific multi people when everyone else have 1? =P
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Everyone is a asshole
<Bronysith> my ass belongs to Saturn
<Bronysith> *an

<Prince_Lightstar> TATS RACIST
<Cajun> Buy it from her for 3
<Blazing_Beatz> DICK HEAD
<Iwa> SpadeKyurem[R]: Sentient creatures acting in a capitalistic environment...it's always the same :(
<Bjornfot> What about your dick?
<Katalenic> if she didn't say that...
<SpadeKyurem[R]> CCharmanderK: And they say this is a kids show
<vanemare> blank_flank matter of fact i did, and I love it
<Combustiblelemons> capitalism is evil.
<Bronysith> everything belongs to Saturn
<iNTERGEN12> He wouldn't have noticed if she didn't say nothing...
<BlitzWing00> I hate that bunny
<Pinkies4thWall> ANGEL YOU GONNA DIE
<twixie_sprinkle> Vordoxensaurus: again, that has nothing to do with the matter. you didnt specify, you classifies them as ordinary americans. plus it has the most multinationalities

<SirGanjalf|Raptor> Make a rabbit stew next...
<J_E_Smith71> CCharmanderK: Simple, its when Merriweather is writing the whole town goes mean
<YokusaHHart> Seriously, why is everyone a jackass in this episode?
<Bjornfot> Can't I borrow them?
<Bronysith> Combustiblelemons: politics gets out
<DinkyDoo> What's the scouter say about Angel's rudeness?
<Cajun> MLP: Genderspent Smurfs sans the Socialism
<Combustiblelemons> indeed
<DinkyDoo> ITS OVER NINE THOUSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND!
<Blazing_Beatz> I would have made that bunny some stew later that night
<J_E_Smith71> YokusaHHart: Because of Merriweather
*DinkyDoo Crushes scouter
<SpadeKyurem[R]> National Act like a Jackass day?
<Combustiblelemons> unleash the capitalistic ranting!
<cowvarkian> Bjornfot: don't you have your own?
<RaveBrony> This can Not be appropriate convo...
<pony_1766> she needs to play tf2 to learn how to bargin
<Pinkies4thWall> DinkyDoo: it says he's a douche
<Blazing_Beatz> Bunny Stew :|
<Kandarihu> SpadeKyurem[R], not everypony. The mare who raised the price on the tomatoes wasn't doing so uncontrollably. The stallion who haggled with her over a single cherry was.
<MadSurge> My ass belongs to me. :|
<cowvarkian> RaveBrony: it totally isnt
<Vordoxensaurus> twixie_sprinkle: I do wonder. :P
<Combustiblelemons> we shall find the superior political structure!
<DinkyDoo> Oh.
*DinkyDoo CRUSHES SCOUTER
<iNTERGEN12> Yeah, its kinda crazy lol.
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> DICKHEADS
<RaveBrony> This chat needs some shaping up.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> CAN YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING
<DinkyDoo> WHO the BUCK just threw Fluttershy to the back?
<Bronysith> with clop
<cowvarkian> agreed
<cowvarkian> shit
<Vordoxensaurus> DinkyDoo: Bon Bon and someone else
<Eli> MadSurge: yep. same here. not giving my ass to anyone
<CCharmanderK> J_E)Smith71: I have to agree with you there. She seems to like exaggerating everypony's personalities for the sake of comedy. Works in shows like Spongebob, but doesn't work well here in MLP:FiM.
<iNTERGEN12> I like this episode.
<iNTERGEN12> Wut
<RaveBrony> Where are the mods at today? x_x

<Kandarihu> Combustiblelemons, what Rarity told Fluttershy to do was right. But apparently the price gouger had an apparent monopoly on his single cherry as far as Fluttershy knew.
<Lindeman> DinkyDoo: Heard of adblock?
<Bronysith> Bjornfot: talk to Saturn
<Vordoxensaurus> DinkyDoo: Adblock+
<MadSurge> cowvarkian: this one isn't
<Katalenic> DinkyDoo that's why you should use Adblock Puls
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Can I safley say Ponyville seems like a worse place ot live each episode?
<RainbowAsh> DinkyDoo, there is no need for this teary despair
<CCharmanderK> DinkyDoo: Install Adblock Plus, bro. It's free.
<cowvarkian> MadSurge: I know
<Combustiblelemons> right.
<cowvarkian> I clicked it was just saying
<J_E_Smith71> SirGanjalf|Raptor: Stick around though the new ep is coming up next

<CCharmanderK> HNNGG
<Blazing_Beatz> CUTE
<Anaruski> dat goat...
<SirGanjalf|Raptor> $_$
<DinkyDoo> Iwa: THAT, is the reason I am afraid to read it. Because its gory.
<CCharmanderK> Cupcakes is scary because of it's deconstructive nature.

<Bronysith> but she ate the cake first

<SirGanjalf|Raptor> Kurra: Well, how would you call Rarity then?
<Kandarihu> BlazeAngel, I didn't mean to say they should become mares, soon. Just... you know, find their cutie marks and let that redefine their characterizations.
<Lindeman> Im gonna find myself some nice ScootDash R34 tonight

<Blaze> Kotano: What sister would have a FAN CLUB of her older sister?
<wipergone2> inb4 luna
<desertman2> This season has a lot more continuity than usual
*Kandarihu hands BlazeAngel a Batman-shaped apple.
<RaveBrony> It is
<RaveBrony> o_e
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Why do people camp then?
<weeping_pegasi82> SWAG
<Kurra> SpadeKyurem[R]: Camping is glorious
<RaveBrony> SpadeKyurem[R]: Nature... o_e
<Kencolt> SpadeKyurem[R]: I liked it when I was younger. These days, ... I'd likely die.
<prince-dari> >thundering stomp
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Fuck nature
<prince-dari> Sounds like Slender
<SirGanjalf> SpadeKyurem[R]: To get more headshots

<Blaze> prince-dari: Why doesn't Dash tell a story about Slendermane?!?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> NIGHTMARE MOOOON!
<SirGanjalf> Blair Witch Pony

<Kandarihu> SirGanjalf, if this season hadn't premiered at the beginning of November, it would've worked as a Halloween episode.
<SirGanjalf> *TWITCH*
<Blaze> Kotano: Probably none, since no one came with Scootaloo to supervise her.... unless you count Dash, but she isn't Scootaloo's sister.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> JESUS RARITy

<Star_Shadow> I mustashe u a question
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, quite. Especially considering that her original role had her waging war against Celestia because her duties of ruling Equestria by night meant that her population slept through it all.

<PetePuma> I gotta go
<Graywolf71> If I knew anything about making mods, I'd make some pony ones for it
<twixie_sprinkle> Kandarihu: yeah i dont think you should worry about that too much, it was an accident and im sure almost any video on youtube is fine, and dari has streamed weirder stuff :P

<d3rb> yeah, alledgedly
*AssaultWithEmbraces is nommled and pokes thelonepony and MahBoi777
<Drew> I'll spend the last days figuring out how to do that!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hey Wrek
<SilentSword> :O AssaultWithEmbraces *glomp*

<Prince_Lightstarrr> i pick rock it putted "LOOK OUT, HERE COMES TOM"
<Wrek> 05hm?
*AssaultWithEmbraces noms SilentSword

<d3rb> Iwa, nonthing that concerns me in my lifetime
<thelonepony> :3
*SilentSword is nommed by AssaultWithEmbraces and giggles
<jcelios> I don't get why people are so obsessed with the "end of the world" history is riddled with tons of these predictions ever since the world began :)
<ekips> Iwa nuclear fallout
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Iwa> Tassadork/d3rb: Not saying any of them is true or factitious...just, which is the most "reasonable" ending :P
<AssaultWithEmbraces> What game is this?
<Drew> Okay, now the mini is really starting too look good :D
<Tassadork> the only remotely realistic one is a big rock, that the astronomers haven't noticed. how anyone could possibly predict it
<Tassadork> that I don't nkow
<SilentSword> AssaultWithEmbraces: i think they said its the Starcraft 2 map editor
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge!
<d3rb> bye flood do you mean flood like the impossible bible flood?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> SilentSword: ooooh o3o

<d3rb> by**
<Prince_Lightstarrr> GOD i got 100% applejack 50% rainbowdash 50% twilight 60% pinkiepie 50% fluttershy and 40% rarity .-.
<maffin> привет
<SilentSword> AssaultWithEmbraces: yeees :3
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces! :3 Wasn't the episode adorable? :3
<Prince_Lightstarrr> WHAT IS THIS MAGIC
<ekips> Prince_Lightstarrr good good, let the AJ flow through you
<maffin> эй броняши
<Iwa> d3rb: Day after Tomorrow style flood, I guess...I find that one the least plausible though :P
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: Yes it was~
<Tassadork> jcelios: some people do! of course, they tend to believe in an afterlife so the the world isn't really 'ending'. still crazy though
<Prince_Lightstarrr> http://www.bronyland.com/goodies/ScootalooLoveSmall.png still in the corner
<d3rb> meteor maybe...i guess. lota junk in space, odds are something will hit eventually
<Prince_Lightstarrr> .-.
<Iwa> jcelios: Some people are so awware of them being mortal, they get anxious about not being able to stop them ending "prematurely", hence losing their minds over these things
<ekips> I still think that nuclear fallout is one of the most possible ones
<Drew> We'll just send nukes at the meteor :3
<spypengen> you guys talking about the apocalyps?
<ekips> but what do I know about politics, wars and stuff like that
*AdamTheDuck passes a jar around "Come on, everyone contribute a few bottlecaps so we can prepare for the nuclear fallout"
<Bronysith> IT ENDS EVANGELION STYLE
<Bronysith> EVERYONE TURNS TO TANG
<d3rb> AdamTheDuck, no my caps!
<jcelios> yum
<DinkyDoo> I WORK AT ZE MUFFIN FACTORY.
<Bronysith> And we all join together in a tang ocean
<DinkyDoo> Because muffins are yummy.
<spypengen> the most likely meteor to hit earth will come in a few thousand years and will have a 1 in 500 chance of hitting earth
<Bronysith> metaphor for ORGY
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't wanna, AdamTheDuck. I have yet to make them into something fanceh.
<d3rb> i wanna be tang
<jcelios> Bronysith: Like the changeling ocean in Deep Space 9>
*AssaultWithEmbraces has never seen Evangelion so she doesn't get the references
<Prince_Lightstarrr> http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=NjMxNHw1NTUyNjA
<ekips> Some terrorist group will overload every nuclear fallout in western civ
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: goddammit writers I want a character to hate :D who am I supposed to dislike now? Gilda?
<Iwa> spypengen: Wasn't there one they predicted would come very close to earth in February 2013?
<ekips> nuclear reactor*

<thelonepony> or whatever name he has
<d3rb> i predict the sun will rise tomorrow, I AM A PROPHET!
<spypengen> yes but that one isn't really as close as the one planned to come in a few thousand years
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I think they're doing that just for you, my dear MadSurge
<MadSurge> thelonepony: :D I completely forgot about that prick
<Prince_Lightstarrr> OMG THE MAP IS A PONY :D
