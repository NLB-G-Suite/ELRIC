<Everlasting_Joy> Lyra`: Actually, I'm America. I just said that because the announcer did for Alexander.
<Shizuka> 13a thousand ships were launched that day
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen you got that right
<RosePetal2> They got their wish.
<Lyra`> you heard me
<cowvarkian> I would've loved this even if it wasnt a comedy
<Michael> it was so awesome!
<Lyra`> earty!
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: having been raised in a cave, that's understandable.

<Meanwhile> Dat ass.
<RosePetal2> The End.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The announcer sounds familiar.
<Rustymeat> SO yeah this movie is pretty fucking great
<DocSane> My theory is that the government covered up the crash and gave them the new show to keep them all quiet.
<alexxm> woooo
<SirGanjalf> Why did i missed this:(
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> this movie > Space Jame
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the end of the movie just before the opening credits for the new Galaxy Quest series, the announcer says "Now back after 18 years, the New Adventures of Galaxy Quest" The original Star Trek was cancelled in 1969 and the Next Generation premiered in 1987, also 18 years later.
<BlazingStreak> I hadn't heard of this before it was drawn. I loved it :O
<Cypresswolf> Fluttercry: Minus thousands of Bronies attempting to storm the stage >_>
<Bronysith> Anti psychopathic meds ?

<Midnight_Fyre> And then someone figures out that there is a real spaceship behind them and the government kidnaps them for questioning
<Mutterguy> hey space jam was pretty god when i was 11
<RosePetal2> Hooray new adventures.

<Cades[Phone]> idk haha
<RosePetal2> Jane Doe.
<Buytoast> HA
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: A very subtle joke is that Guy believes his character is now safe since he is the security chief and has a name on the revival series. The named, main character security chief of the revival series Star Trek: The Next Generation was killed off in the first season.
<VenHur> I can see why this is the A Movie, shit gets real around the second half and the climax.

<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The promotional campaign for the film included a "mockumentary" for the E! cable channel about the fictional Galaxy Quest TV series. Most of the cast members appeared as their actor characters from the film. Extras from the film's convention scenes also appeared as fans giving candid interviews. Out-takes and behind the scenes footage from the film were used as
<RosePetal2> Mum/10

The humor even went so far as Sigourney Weaver's character, Gwen DeMarco, claiming that she had turned down "a small part in a Woody Allen movie" to do the Galaxy Quest series [A reference to one of her first, though very brief, big screen cameos as Alvy's (Allen's) date at the end ofAnnie Hall].

<Shizuka> 13I loved Galaxy Quest. I thought it was brilliant satire, not only of Trek, but of fandom in general. The only thing I wish they had done was cast me in it, and have me play a freaky fanboy who keeps screaming at the actor who played "the kid" about how awful it was that there was a kid on the spaceship. Alas. — Wil Wheaton, who played "the kid" Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: The Next Generation

<Ryunosuke> Lo
<JESmith71> “I had originally not wanted to see Galaxy Quest because I heard that it was making fun of Star Trek and then Jonathan Frakes rang me up and said “You must not miss this movie! See it on a Saturday night in a full theatre”. And I did and of course I found it was brilliant. Brilliant. No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did, but the idea that the ship was saved and all of our heroes in that movie were saved simply by the fact t

<Tovler> Gravity Falls is amazing. I'm afraid to hype it up
<IshHamsterJelly> Sarris totally looked like a member of GWAR
<OohShiny> weeping_pegasi82: from what I heard of, yes
<JESmith71> “I thought it was very funny, and I thought the audience that they portrayed was totally real, but the actors that they were pretending to be were totally unrecognizable. Certainly I don’t know what Tim Allen was doing. He seemed to be the head of a group of actors and for the life of me I was trying to understand who he was imitating. The only one I recognized was the girl playing Nichelle Nichols.” – William Shatner

<Meanwhile> otakon we're still on Galaxy credits.
<Lyra`> i barely passed the suicide prevention course
<Silverscreen> 01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: This is THE sci-fi comedy movie. I honestly can not think of a movie as good as this. Perfectly cast, perfectly performed, perfectly shot. The story is believable for its setting, its characters enjoyable and memorable, the comedy is spot on, the references are great for any sci-fi lover, and its effects are pretty damn good for being made in the late 1990's.
<Silverscreen> 1,1110/10
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> we should stream Gravity falls sometime
<alexia> hurry up ponies
<Meanwhile> Oh you mean entering?
<otakon> doesn't matter Meanwhile the survey is closed
<Pale_Horse> Never give up! Never Surrender!/10
<weeping_pegasi82> you can never trust disney shows after *shudder* hannah montana ugh
<OohShiny> there's only 10 episodes of gravity falls, let's wait some more
<Meanwhile> Hah
<Star_Shadow> Yeah gravity falls
<Tovler> although there are way too many people who hate the artstyle of Gravity falls.
<otakon> why don't they send out the lotteries SOONER?
<Meanwhile> Sucks to be you.
<AlienWarhead> NxPaqu Galaxy Quest
<JESmith71> “I loved Galaxy Quest. I thought it was brilliant satire, not only of Trek, but of fandom in general. The only thing I wish they had done was cast me in it, and have me play a freaky fanboy who keeps screaming at the actor who played “the kid” about how awful it was that there was a kid on the spaceship. Alas.” – Wil Wheaton
<Dken2021> OohShiny only 10? is it using traditional animation?
<otakon> the fuck sending it out on THursday
<NxPaqu> AlienWarhead: Thank You
<Midnight_Fyre> I'm hoping they don't pick anything good in the lottery this week because I'll be at Canterlot Gardens next week

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> 1: Twilight 2: Sparkle
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon: I'm guessing it's a bug they're working on.
<Meanwhile> I'm fairly well versed in psychological conditions but only from hobby.
<JESmith71> I think it’s a chillingly realistic documentary [laughs]. The details in it, I recognized every one of them. It is a powerful piece of documentary filmmaking. And I do believe that when we get kidnapped by aliens, it’s going to be the genuine, true Star Trek fans who will save the day. I was rolling in the aisles. And Tim Allen had that Shatner-esque swagger down pat. And I roared when the shirt came off, and Sigourney rolls her eyes and says, â
<OohShiny> Dken2021: no, it's because it's a new show
<otakon> well at least it's not jsut me that thinks that
<Dark92Enigma> JESmith71 i'LL Try. to. act. like. Shatner. while. reading THIS, Dear boy

<Silverscreen> 01,11As a general rule, I put most comedies on a B list level due to the jokes and comedian's talent being the highlight of the film. This is one of the rare comedy movies that defy that rule, and as such it's one of the rare comedies that I count as an A list film.
<AlienWarhead> TANK!
<Rosfox> HURRY
<Barbetos> She is all better now though!

<Silverscreen> 01,11otakon: Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs are kinda funny, but since they are entirely focused on being a satire rather than making their own original story, I don't think they qualify as an A movie.

<Saturn> 08,01so i've just worked out
<Silverscreen> 01,11Galaxy Quested created it's humor by being an original series, and added the satire overtop. Which is why I qualify it as a better movie than Blazing Saddles and SPaceballs. It's not about how much I like them, but about how they're made.

<Madfish> Spike! Stay here and miss another adventure!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Story*
<RAWRity> the funny thing is, I originally never planned on writing that fic
<Kandarihu> You know, there was an oft-parodied tendancy in Star Trek TOS about societies that based themselves after small parts of human history. A TNG episode had aliens who recreated a work of fiction mistaking it for reality. I think that's the foundation for the Thermian civilization: what if an alien race models their society based on Star Trek?
<Spazturtle> Holy shit she went in
<OohShiny> poison joke
<RepublicGuard|bob> applebloom makes good pie
<RAWRity> but then everyone in the chat pestered me about it for 2 months.

<Ninjazz> Again?
<Randomnerd> Meeeee!
<SpacePretender> 0,14but yeah, congrats to you winning people
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03so yeah, that's the lottery!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03If you didn't win...
<RAWRity> you know, you'd think that with the wide range of movie that get released, people would request more than like, the same 10 films. Also, you'd think people would request episodes other than Lesson Zero and Luna Eclipsed
<Lyra`> but my roomate hates girl love D:
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You get a rize!
<Lyra`> what do i do!
<Cades[Phone]> LOL
<Silverscreen> 01,11Agree with Shizuka. I want some more diversity with the episode selections. How long has it been since we seen Look before you Sleep or Swarm of the Century? Have we ever showed Green Isn't Your Color since S2 ended? What about Sweet and Elite or Mare Do Well? There's tons of episodes that just aren't selected anymore.
<Dken2021> so, how many times has that made lesson zero been played here?
<SpacePretender> 0,14too many
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03[Only available to Bronystate Gold]
<SpacePretender> 0,14I like the ep
<SpacePretender> 0,14but damn
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03members*
<RAWRity> Dken2021: too many. yet still not as much as Luna Eclipsed.
<DSNesmith> just do what I do, don't watch the pony episodes
<SpacePretender> 0,14we need some Dragon Quest, yo
<Silverscreen> 01,11inb4 complaining about MDW
<SpacePretender> 0,14We haven't seen Dragon Quest
<RAWRity> honestly, I do NOT get why people call Lesson Zero an amazing episode. It's decent at best.
<SpacePretender> 0,14ever
<DSNesmith> I marathon the show once or twice a year, I don't watch old eps every week
<Dken2021> yes, I long for such an episode saxy, sadly it'll take awhile
<Ninjazz> We needs some Art of the Dress in there.
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: Yes, I asked for something else, and you're all lining up for cyanide...
<Sumica> 00,10yeah so?
<Fluttercry> 05,15SpacePretender you're right. I never realized that
<SpacePretender> 0,14It aired on my birthday ;__;
<RAWRity> Luna Eclipsed I got, because people in this fandom want to fuck/hug luna all day long.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We haven't seen Luna Eclipse in at LEAST a month...
<Bronysith> RAWRity: both
<Sumica> 00,10oh you meen the pony ep
<Randomnerd> I ask for "Green is not your Color" pretty much every week.
<DSNesmith> welp, convo derailed
<Sumica> 00,10I thought you ment the movie
<SpacePretender> 0,14yeah >.>
<SpacePretender> 0,14there's a movie?
<DSNesmith> I keep suggesting Owl's Well, because that episode needs more love
<SpacePretender> 0,14I'll, uh, be over THERE
<SpacePretender> 0,14in the corner
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yeah, that MLP moive, you heard?
<RAWRity> but Lesson Zero didn't even have fanservice to garner the attention/metaphorical blowjobs people have been giving it for the last year.
<DSNesmith> sure it has the GODDAMN OWL, but it also has spike with a moustache
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03movie*
<ASoftFluffyThing> Where was Gondor when Lesson Zero was banned?
<SpacePretender> 0,14well, we can -m, righ-
<CrimsonPhoenix> WREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK
<tSparx> Yay for Lesson Zero! Well, I hate to be a party-pooper, but I am off, to not watch Space Jam and not deal with movie-night-chat and do other things. Bye everypony!
<Ninjazz> mfw another mod gets picked. =_=
<XAX> Gondor was busy really going as far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when it was time to slam?
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Lucky you. :D
<Dken2021> I'll just suggest some season 2 episode since only half of them are ever suggested
<alexxm> night gusy
<Kurra> if I win a raffle, i'm picking that MLP movie forever
<DashWithRainbows> That's a lot of E's.
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, tSparx :)
<AJIsAwesome> NIght alexxm :)
<Derpy_Hooves> yay me
<Derpy_Hooves> ~
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> alexxm: dream of ponies
<DSNesmith> protip: some people like episodes for reasons other than fanservice
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye alexxm and tSparx
<kidzrul434> Didn't we already see space jam already?
<scout19_tf2> nite alexxm
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: now i cant complain about never winning :D
<DashWithRainbows> Nope.
<Silverscreen> 01,11XAX: wat
<CK|Werk> Right to watching Lesson Zero, suspended. Also, mfw people complain about everyone picking their favorite eps. XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> kidzrul434, 6 months rule
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight alexxm and tSparx
<JESmith71> Finally Lesson Zero wins...though now I have a problem of picking a new pony episode to vote forn ow...
<DashWithRainbows> I don't think it has ever been shown on BS.
<Buytoast> Lesson Zero always wins.
<Dark92En|gma> twilight_sprinkle: Wrek you won with my picks!
<BlazingStreak> I'll watch space jam tomorrow. It's 2am and I have a big day of exploring Pandora ahead of me! Bye everypony :)
<AJIsAwesome> CK|Werk: IKR? :|
<kidzrul434> but but but but but but but but but HOW?!!!!!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I know we haven't seen my MLP pick yet...
<Silverscreen> 01,11kidzrul434: The last time I remember watching Space Jam was the second week of BMN.
<Dovah> Hello everypony, just got back from school and then job, what did i miss?
<DashWithRainbows> Oh, it was streamed?
<Mozdoc> Yes, yes we will need therapy after this next movie!
<DSNesmith> it's one of my favs just for the gag/running time density
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I'm probably the only one voting for it, too.
<Dark92En|gma> twilight_sprinkle: I picked the same Batman movie too!
<DashWithRainbows> But then again, that was sooooo long ago.
<XAX> Silverscreen: iunno
<Nightfall> Oh leverage.
<d3rb_> maybe encores should be removed pre lotto?
<JESmith71> This is the first time Lesson Zero's won since i've been voting lotto. I mean it has been shown once or twice outside of BMN
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: i was more syaing fanservice is the only reason Luna Eclipsed gets the praise and felatio it does from the fandom.
<AJIsAwesome> I actually like MDW, even though it has it faults. To be honest, I LOVE the episode.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92En|gma: thats the 2008 right? im kinda confused with the similar names, i havent seen it before
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> When was Dark Knight shown last? I feel like we've seen that recently.
<AlienWarhead> Dovah Galaxy Quest and Bridle Gossup
<DSNesmith> but it was also a funny episode
<Dark92En|gma> Silverscreen: so this calls for a THROWBACK
<DSNesmith> that's why I like it
<inkBot> Would Feeling Pinkie Keen be considered one of those eps that gets showed too much?
<Buytoast> I'm contempt knowing i will probably never get picked for this god forsaken lottery.
<CK|Werk> Seriously, stop for a second and think about that. "We're letting you pick what episodes we show, but if you keep picking your favorites (which logically most people are going to do) then we'll whine." wat.
<twilight_sprinkle> DERPDERPDERPDERP: like 9 months at least i think
<CrimsonPhoenix> I actually try to put up various obscure episode
<Kurra> the poison ivy.... IT ITCHESSSSS fffff *scratch scrape bodyslide*
<CrimsonPhoenix> like this week was.....
<Bronysith> also
<Dark92En|gma> twilight_sprinkle: EEEEEYUP, the 2008 one
<Bronysith> WHY NO LOVE FOR APPLEJACK
<Bronysith> we rarely she her one episode
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92En|gma: ok good, ive never seen it :P
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> twilight_sprinkle: Oh was it? Maybe I've just seen it recently then lol.
<Dovah> have next weeks movies been selected? and if so what are they?
<Bronysith> *see
<Dark92En|gma> AJIsAwesome: MDW?

<Bronysith> we saw her episode last week
<Dark92En|gma> AJIsAwesome: Oh. that one.....
<AJIsAwesome> I picked Green Isn't Your Color.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Seriously. I never liked Luna Eclipsed that much in the first place, but after seeing it so many times I can't stand it
<Dark92En|gma> twilight_sprinkle: so, finally you won!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03BS post is best post
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, knows what's up
<MLP_Brovakiin> How long is space jam?
<Silverscreen> 01,11AJIsAwesome: I loved Mare Do Well too. I highly disagree with people saying that everyone was out of character.
*Dark92En|gma hugs twilight_sprinkle!
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92En|gma: and now i cant complain about it anymore :(
<AJIsAwesome> Silverscreen: /)
<somepony_else> i picked suited for succsess
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I got picked for the B movie like 3 times in the first 2 months of BMN, but not at all since. I got to get some good Halloween picks now.

*twilight_sprinkle hugs Dark92En|gma :D
<DSNesmith> cupofshit, how eloquent
<CK|Werk> Silverscreen: I don't have character issues with that episode. I do admit that the episode botched its moral, though.
<sonicdude558> oh good its open
<sonicdude558> thank god
<Ryunosuke> mare do well wasnt a bad ep
<Dark92En|gma> Silverscreen: and the moral? it was al little..........forced
<JESmith71> I agree you guys should extend the amount of time a pony episode can been shown again to prevent so many encores
<Dark92En|gma> IMO*
<Kandarihu> I've been voting for Dragon Quest since the last chance I got my pick
<Bronysith> and yes, applejack only has one episode
<Fluttercry> 05,15Such a professional no?
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Bogus.
<RAWRity> Fluttercry: pretty much.
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tpCRBgs-LE&feature=relmfu
<Randomnerd> You mean Derpy?
<Silverscreen> 01,11CK|Werk: How so? I thought the message was quite clear: Don't be an arrogant jerk. Don't let fame go to your head and act like an idiot just to be popular.
<Kimori> oh, your not here :P
<JESmith71> Says a guy who's voted Lesson Zero, but this is the first time I've seen it win since I started voting for lotto
<HatsuneMikuFan> Did the lotto already happened>
<Shizuka> 13best part of my horrible video right here
<HatsuneMikuFan> ?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: no one remembers her other episode cause they have boners from derpy talking
<Shizuka> 13nifflas is awesome
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight everyone, thanks for the movies <3
<Ryunosuke> we talking about rainbow dash... or trixy Silverscreen
<AJIsAwesome> HatsuneMikuFan: Yes

<AJIsAwesome> Ryunosuke: RD.
<SpacePretender> 0,14>horrible
<SpacePretender> 0,14nah

<RAWRity> Derpy talking was at least noteworthy because nobody expected it.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03ahem http://i.imgur.com/3yUJ5.jpg
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Agreed, but I remember them.
<JESmith71> Now I have a dilemma. I don't what Pony Ep to vote for anymore now
<HatsuneMikuFan> What were the winners?
<Fluttercry> 05,15>implying this video is bad
<CK|Werk> Silverscreen: You mean like the other members of the Mane 6 were doing? :P "A real hero doesn't brag!" hot off the heels of each member of MDW bragging about their own achievements.
<Fluttercry> 05,15OH GOD MY SIDES
<Kandarihu> So which pony episodes are next week?
<Dark92En|gma> Sumica is streaming, right?
<Silverscreen> 01,11actually, that could go to both of you.
<XylemTube> CLOCK EEZ TEEKING
<Ryunosuke> AJIsAwesome, I know, it just seems like after the whole Trixy ep, RD would have gotten the hint :)
<AJIsAwesome> Oh.
<Dark92En|gma> Silverscreen: oh :)
<Bronysith> But they had to put it in with MLP FIMs least fav of the mane six
<RAWRity> and Last Round-up as a whole was rather uneven, so were it not for Derpy, most wouldn't even remember it.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/lZ22u.jpg it is bad and you know it don't you

<Silverscreen> 01,11CK|Werk: It's called a lesson through example. They were giving RD a taste of her own medicine, only doing it to show RD how much of a jerk she was being. None of it was real for them.

<Dark92En|gma> Shizuka, Sumica, if you're streaming......please play the Nostalgia Critic review of Space Jam when Movie Night is over.......please :(?
<DashWithRainbows> Oh, I know.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: because if i say it is going to be disapointing then when it is awesome i will be "HOLY SHIT THAT IS AWESOME"
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03French people are Prop people~
<CK|Werk> Silverscreen: The problem is that it doesn't work, it's hypocrisy. That would be the case if they were complimenting each others' achievements, but they weren't. They were doing exactly what she was doing, and then trying to be high and mighty on the moral high horse about it. It just falls flat.
<Cades[Phone]> it sucks that i can only go on one website at a time on my phone :/

<MrBen> We have to go derper!
<RAWRity> or, you could, you know, just not try and hype it up or down, and wait for it.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Because season 2 was. I'm not going to say Season 3 is going to be bad, but I'm just being cautious
<Tovler> k, back. I avoided the lottery so I wouldn't have to face losing the lottery again.
<Dr_Fumbles> derpenest
<Ryunosuke> actually, would be inclined to agree that the mods seem to have a higher chance of winning :)
<Sumica> 00,10you realy think I would pick this crap if it was rigged?
<Shizuka> 13if it were rigged, we would have atlas shrugged for B, because i didn't even vote this week
<Mozdoc> Deeeper. There's mufins there...
<DSNesmith> if I want character development I'll read a book or watch a dramatic series
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03no video links please~
<Dken2021> yea same here, comparisons to both seasons, season 1 was trying to find it's place, and season 2 kinda got too comfortable in the safe zone if you catch my drift
<Silverscreen> 01,11They were doing what she was doing to prove the point. They did it NOT because they were being arrogant, they were doing it because they wanted RD to realize how annoying it was. -_-
<DashWithRainbows> SpacePretender I'm going to have to start participating for the lottery just for that movie.
<MrBen> We +m the TOOT spam here, yes?
<RAWRity> There's also the fact that the show DID have character development in S2.

<DSNesmith> people hated the CMC episodes, FPK, owl's well
<Silverscreen> 01,11Spazturtle: this is the argument everyone brings up, and here's my argument back: Think about RD's character. They know she doesn't listen when she thinks she's right. They could talk to her all they wanted, but her overinflated ego would have just ignored it and moved on to another fan. They had to teach through example.
<Spanner_Pony> TOOT
<DSNesmith> they're just nostalgiaing

<Dr_Fumbles> I love Ponecrat... er, minecraft
<RDash5000> i don't get it
<SpacePretender> 0,14I actually liked the CMC eps
<CK|Werk> Silverscreen: The problem with presenting a moral in that fashion is that you're not any better than the other person. You're basically saying "watch as I act like a wanker so that I can show you how much of a wanker you are". That just makes you BOTH wankers.
<Kurra> I'd be subdued about it Scoot-Scootaloo! Slight yellow white on very dark midnight blue!

<SpacePretender> 0,14I MEANT BASKETBALLS
<Meanwhile> Also
<VenHur> I BELIEVE CAN FLY!
<CK|Werk> Silverscreen: And considering how easy it would be to avoid the problem altogether (simply by having the characters refer to each others' statements, lending greater strength to the idea of encouraging each others' accomplishments) does make the episode a bit weaker on the whole. It honestly could have been done better, is all.
<Ninjazz> Goddamnit, missing Space Jam.

<IshHamsterJelly> oh noes, a pop song
<Silverscreen> 01,11CK|Werk: Sometimes the best and only way to get someone to understand something is to show them exactly what they're doing wrong. That's what they did. And at the end, they openly stated that they weren't being jerks, they were trying to teach RD.

<Bugs_Bunny> :I
<CK|Werk> Silverscreen: Being a jerk and saying "oh I'm just trying to teach someone a lesson" generally doesn't work out to you being some sort of moral authority in real life, Silver. :P
<Dken2021> Sumica you're thinking of shaq
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, ._.

<Buytoast> hell, i had space jam jammies, pillowcase and sheets
<Silverscreen> 01,11CK|Werk: That bit is completely contraditing to what they were trying to do. They wanted to show Rainbow Dash that being arrogant isn't good. The only way to do that was to show Rainbow Dash how bad it was because she wouldn't have learned otherwise.
<Sinestro> >that feel when live in NC but too poor for NCstate
<MrBen> Scoot-Scootaloo: What, no hugs for me?

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03HOOP! THERE IT IS!
<Meanwhile> Yeah yeah it's fine.
<CK|Werk> Silverscreen: Again, for what it's worth I actually like the episode. But I have to admit that it has its faults and flaws, the big one being the method of presenting the moral. Sort of like how the Pinkie Sense was a good story that ended up poorly explaining its moral.
<Fluttercry> 05,15I know the movie is terrible. But I love it

<MrBen> CrimsonPhoenix: I suppose I should take this as a given, but I suppose somebody already did a Space Jam/Fresh Prince mash up?
<Dante> Same
<OohShiny> Bugs Bunny is awesome
<Dovah> bugs bunny is teh best
<K_A> Shizuka: Weird, ain't it? I grew up on WB shorts.
<Buytoast> bugs buny's modern take is in some shitty animated sitcom
<DaringDerpy> sadistic rodent
<Fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka they rebooted Loony Toons
<Azuredragon> Bugs was best
<AlienWarhead> Shizuka some do
<superretroworld> i have to admit, i never got into looney tunes until watching this as a kid
<Dr_Fumbles> I think this is a guilty pleasure for a lot of people
<Buytoast> of course they don't know what bugs bunny is
<Ponies47> This movie is ok. Btut we should stream Looney Tunes Back in Action sometime :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> MrBen, I believe so, let me search it up and I'll pm you
<Tovler> Sure they do. Bug Bunny is that guy in that boring ass show on CN
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03The hell is a Bugs Bunny? Is that some sort of hooker name?
<IshHamsterJelly> wait
<Slen> Shizuka: They have a new Looney Tunes show
<CK|Werk> >reboot

<CK|Werk> >Looney Toons
<Ponies47> Scoot-Scootaloo: XD
<Wolfmane> Watched this movie so many times ^-^
<robot> its the shame the new bugs bunny show is mostly a sitcom
<CK|Werk> THE FUCK
<Shizuka> 13they shunted the good stuff to boomerang, along with goddamn dexters lab
<JESmith71> Shizuka: There's the Looney Tunes Shows plus CN still shows old-school Looney Tunes
<K_A> One does not simply reboot Looney Toons.
<HatsuneMikuFan> It's been years since I watch this movie,
<RAWRity> to this day, Michael Jordan is the only basketbal player I actually recognise
<nerf_soldier> Shizuka: I'd pity today's children if it weren't for MLP
<DSNesmith> it's shamelessly 90s awful
<Wirisme> needs more seizure
<HatsuneMikuFan> .
<DSNesmith> that's why it's awesome
<Mutterguy> Well that was good timing
<Slen> chat move too fast
<DashWithRainbows> Gawd dang it Scoot.
<Dken2021> I belive shizu was talking about the crazy antics bugs, not reboot
<Kurra> Fluttercry, into jaded overly grown-up characters with a Seinfeld flavor? ....ewwgh for me at least @_@
<IshHamsterJelly> wrong cash-in on basketball player's succes film
<Shizuka> 13a show that started in 1997 does not belong on the channel started by flintstones
<SpaceyJamGunny> Scoot-Scootaloo Bugs Bunny was an MLG pro before MLG existed :3
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: That's what the Season DVDs are for.
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The concept for this movie originated from a series of highly popular Nike ads where Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan faced off against Marvin the Martian and his alien henchmen in basketball.
<Mutterguy> went to the shop and back
<Kurra> there is that other Looney Tunes reboot tooo
<Dark92En|gma> Silverscreen: i call this movie.....a ''gulity pleasure''......i loved it as a child, and the age, and the Nostalgia Critic made me realize how bad it is......but it's A MASTERPIECE COMPARED to.............the movie that followed it
<Dovah> Shizuka: dexters lab? isnt that on right now?
<JappleAck> hay everypony
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi JappleAck
<K_A> Also, Looney Toons in the Golden Era was kinda a reboot in itself of the classic, more music-oriented Merry Melody shorts.
<JESmith71> They still show old-school Looney Tunes at like 11 or so
<Azura> @Shizuka i dont think so
<IshHamsterJelly> *success
<AJIsAwesome> hi JappleAck
<superretroworld> hello JappleAck

<Sly> YA
<XylemTube> Silverscreen: WOW, a peice of trivia that i ALREADY knew about
<MrBen> Silverscreen: So this movie originated from COMMERICALS.
<Dken2021> Silverscreen in other words's it's a glorified ad placem,ent
<Garrus_Vakarian> My brother could of made it into minor league baseball but he threw it away for a life of weed and living in the room next to mine

<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film's script originally contained a mention of Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman's character) having been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. Rickman asked that this be changed because he believed it was inconsistent with the character, and all mentions of the knighting were removed. However, the character is still listed in the credits as "Sir Alexander Dane".

<Deadlypon3> "What a bunch of Hosers :O!"

<Deadlypon3> Galaxy Quest Dancers, Sign me UP!
<StinkomanFan> :'(
<Vordox> Kurra: hope not...
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene when Tim Allen is in a mens room overhearing how the cast of Galaxy Quest are nobodies and all the co-stars can't stand him mirrors an actual event in William Shatner's life. He discovered the exact same things about himself when he attended a Star Trek convention.
<Caramel> 2,14 Kurra: eenope...she sees much...much worse
<Apokalipse> Even if you've never watched Star Trek?
<Deadlypon3> Kurra that would imply people HATE MLP

<Vordox> Silverscreen: Oh god...
<CountDoofus> Ponies47: sucks to hear that. Wish there was anything I could do. <3
<Kurra> Caramel, you can't be serious D:
<Meanwhile> It's a parody, the only relation to actual Star Trek are jokes.
<Vordox> Kencolt: <3 Thank you for translating

<Dante> i dunno
<Vordox> Silverscreen: There's always gonna be hater, huh....
<SirGanjalf|GQuest> eenope
<JESmith71> And he still wears the makeup even at home
<CountDoofus> Ninjazz: It's a medical condition.
<Groogle> What movie is this?
<Vordox> JESmith71: Keeping in role
<Deadlypon3> JESmith71 he's a dedicated actor :P
<Silverscreen> 01,11To be fair, Shatner was a bit of an asshole in the prime of his Star Trek fame.
<SirGanjalf|GQuest> Now that's a role decication
<Sylandest> hehe
<Ninjazz> CountDoofus, I'd seek immediate help.
<Deadlypon3> Silverscreen 'a bit'?
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Still...
<Kurra> whoa, mullet time.
<Brad[Laptop]> I actually saw galaxy quest for the first time about a week ago.
<Meanwhile> Half of the audience have probably written fanfics of the Commander and Headpiece-guy

<Ponies47> CountDoofus: I've been in this sort of mod for atleast a week now or so it changes from time to time. Just general stuff in life you know? The only thing that made me really happy was I became a admin for a Steeam group.
<SirGanjalf|GQuest> ded
<Caramel> 2,14 I'd be an asshole too if I had to deal with trekies the way he did
<Alchemist> if hes just a low class actor how can he afford to live in a house like that?!!

<Kencolt> Silverscreen: He was also, during the actual making of the showl, an insane prankster. Nimoy's books about the making ( I am not Spock and I Am Spock) showed him to play crazy jukes frequently.
<StinkomanFan> In fifteen years there'll be a movie about the MLP Cast going to Equestria.

<Silverscreen> 01,11According to writer David Howard, the continuous melodic yet monotone voice of Thermian Cmdr. Mathesar was an original idea that Enrico Colantoni brought to the character. Everyone on the set loved it so much they kept it as a character trait.

<scout19_tf2> hey yo wuts up everypony;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah, but some bronies think that Faust is a god and want to create a religion out of MLP.

<Blako> where did you get that big one?
<Sir> best idea ever
<Deadlypon3> Toss it at them, killer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01True Vordox.
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Director Dean Parisot and star Tim Allen have revealed in interviews that the original tone of the film was much darker, with more scenes of violence. After test screenings the film was re-cut to emphasize the comedy and obtain a PG rating.
<Vordox> <---- inb4 Big mistake
<Adjeca> where i got most of them - ebay
<Kurra> Do people really ACTUALLY want to create an MLP religion? Fffffff......
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some Star Trek nerds make Jedi a religion.
<cachi01|phone> ^ dafuq
<oodweys> :D
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: The bigger group, the more variations, And some extremities coming back and forth
<Adjeca> i check it every day for spyro stuff
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Isn't that Star Wars nerds?
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: So I heard... But there's some thing you forgot..
<Deadlypon3> Silverscreen remember: "Well 'Screw' that!'
<Caramel> 2,14 Jedi is a legal religion in the UK
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I meant Star Warks.
*Kurra started the whole channel on this topic :)
<Adjeca> the big one was from some scammer

*Kurra wins :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*Wars
<GabeMoist> Warks
<oodweys> the six pillars of harmony in Faustism ^
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: There's benefits for Religions, Like the Swedish Pirate Party became a religion to be in power of democracy
<Lil_B> Kurra I've seen an donation drive to fund a Town for Bronys
<alexxm> to close
<cachi01|phone> Star warks is now canon
<Adjeca> i got it earlier this year for 400 bucks

<AJIsAwesome|Snacktim> Lil_B: But to be honest, do we REALLY need a town for bronies?
<GLaDOS> Lil_B: I saw some guy plan to buy an island for bronies.
<pony_5656> what are we watching?

<Lil_B> Kurra but they didn't get enough money (their gopal was 950.000$)
<StinkomanFan> IN OUTER SPAAAACE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't think the Swedish Pirate Party is related to Kopism.
<JESmith71> I was about to bring the island up
<oodweys> not enough rubies
<Caramel> 2,14 glados: short answer- no. Long answer- hell no
<cachi01|phone> GLaDOS yep
<Adjeca> i'm glad i got it out of his hands... he was trying to sell it for a thousand dollars
<Alchemist> Ohai Nittany_Discord , havent seen you in a while. this is for you: http://derpy.me/3Dv7f
<Lil_B> GLaDOS maybe it was actually that I saw, but I think both is too much
<Deadlypon3> Ahiiieeeealalala
<pony_5Powzk> LOL:D
<cachi01|phone> But that would be like bronyland
<Red_Pegasus> WORM HOLE
<Kurra> Lil_B, towns can be started and stuff with fewer resources and things o.o this can be really done.
<Vordox> Caramel: I wouldn't mind a country for Bronies alone,

<Deadlypon3> ....Well, that happened :P

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. The Island of Equestria project flopped.
<Sir> oO
<pony_5656> thats the guy from harry potter
<JESmith71> What were the people making the island thinking? Even if they got the money they wouldn't have the constant supply of cash to keep such a place habitable
<DaringDerpy> why?
<Adjeca> he was violating ebay policy by manipulating bids. i didn't want to report him because i wanted it :)
<SirTornado> JESmith71: Exactly my thoughts.
<AJIsAwesome|Snacktim> JESmith71: Exactly.
<Silverscreen> 01,11I just noticed that Rickman has a bit of a niche: His characters are usually angsty and pissed. XD

<Apokalipse> Silverscreen just said I can marry his random movie trivia
<abronylikeyou> Who's the guy with the blade head?
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Alan Rickman never takes off his headpiece throughout the entire movie. Even in the scene when he and Gwen (Sigourney Weaver) are both at home talking to each other on the phone, Rickman still has his headpiece on, even though he is not in costume.
<Kurra> this is likely a good movie, but it causes me pain sorta.... @_X;

<Vordox> LAWl Tim Allen! XD
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Thermians use appearance generators to assume human form, while their true form is that of massive alien beings with several tentacles. This concept was possibly taken from the Star Trek episode By Any Other Name

<Kandarihu> The camera conveniently skips the potentially damaged part of the ship
<Quick_Thinker> me too
<mitamaking> Poor Alan
<Dester> Suddenly, blown up planet
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When the crew are eating aboard the ship, they are told that the food has been prepared based on their regional cuisine. The commander comments that the steak tastes like Iowa Beef. This seems like a subtle reference to the fact that Captain Kirk (Star Trek) is from Iowa.
<Lil_B> Silverscreen no, clap like Citicen Kane
<Fl00t4hSh41> Like moms homecooking
<Deadlypon3> Just like motha

<Lil_B> Oh... I guess som,ebody set them up the bomb
<doctor_whooves127> red loks blue to me
<Kurra> honestly, if any aliens need our help, I'd tell them to go play Steam and figure us out that way.
<doctor_whooves127> looks
<Tassadork> the design of the protector is actually really, really good too
<abronylikeyou> WHY
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The design for Sarris' starship is a crossover between the designs for the planet-killing "Doomsday Machine" from Star Trek: The Doomsday Machine (notably the massive, glowing maw in the front of the ship) and a D'deridex-class Romulan warbird from Star Trek: The Next Generation (the open design of the rear nacelles).
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Indeed. And as I said, this movies Props are SUPRISINGLY good.
<Kurra> Steam is prolly the easiest way to crosstrain humans and aliens for ANYTHING possible.

<AJIsAwesome> Nvm
<Saturn> 08,01i wish Geordi was like that in TNG
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The set of the NSEA Protector was built on an articulated platform so that it could move a few feet in any direction, for a touch of realism (instead of actors leaning in unison). When it was first used the set dropped two feet and shifted to the side, causing several cast members to fall out of their chairs and two lights to fall down. This take was used for the

<JESmith71> “I had originally not wanted to see Galaxy Quest because I heard that it was making fun of Star Trek and then Jonathan Frakes rang me up and said “You must not miss this movie! See it on a Saturday night in a full theatre”. And I did and of course I found it was brilliant. Brilliant. No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did, but the idea that the ship was saved and all of our heroes in that movie were saved simply by the fact t
<Kurra> I started off ewwwed by it, now I <3 it, good job :3
<Vordox> Thank you Bronystate!
<Vordox> THANK YOU
<AJIsAwesome> Np.
<Ninjazz> 9/10 Pretty fun. Alan Rickman. For a person who never watched a bit of Star Trek, it was pretty enjoyable.
<JESmith71> “I thought it was very funny, and I thought the audience that they portrayed was totally real, but the actors that they were pretending to be were totally unrecognizable. Certainly I don’t know what Tim Allen was doing. He seemed to be the head of a group of actors and for the life of me I was trying to understand who he was imitating. The only one I recognized was the girl playing Nichelle Nichols.” – William Shatner

<JESmith71> “I loved Galaxy Quest. I thought it was brilliant satire, not only of Trek, but of fandom in general. The only thing I wish they had done was cast me in it, and have me play a freaky fanboy who keeps screaming at the actor who played “the kid” about how awful it was that there was a kid on the spaceship. Alas.” – Wil Wheaton

<JESmith71> “I think it’s a chillingly realistic documentary [laughs]. The details in it, I recognized every one of them. It is a powerful piece of documentary filmmaking. And I do believe that when we get kidnapped by aliens, it’s going to be the genuine, true Star Trek fans who will save the day. I was rolling in the aisles. And Tim Allen had that Shatner-esque swagger down pat. And I roared when the shirt came off, and Sigourney rolls her eyes and says
<Dester> October prolly, you see hub said less than 30 days untill they anounce when it begins
<Lil_B> and hwere in equestria do these rolling bushes suddenly com,e from

<StinkomanFan> ALONE IN THE DARK
<Silverscreen> 01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: This is THE sci-fi comedy movie. I honestly can not think of a movie as good as this. Perfectly cast, perfectly performed, perfectly shot. The story is believable for its setting, its characters enjoyable and memorable, the comedy is spot on, the references are great for any sci-fi lover, and its effects are pretty damn good for being made in the late 1990's.
<Silverscreen> 1,1110/10
<Dester> <sketch_toku_bronjy> I would watch that move so HARD
<mitamaking> Oh hi Applebloom
<Vordox> Whose footprints are these
<JESmith71> Dang it Caramel you skipped the credits I would have spaced out those Trek actor quotes
<General_Kerr> :$ the emocations are ponies
<General_Kerr> nice
<TrollFace> shes got lazer eyes, beware!
<Dester> Sup Zeccora?
<Lil_B> question, why does she have glowing eyes?
<Vordox> Silverscreen: So...Space Balls is the B Sci Fi Movie, but the A is Galaxy Quest, Silverscreen ?
<Kencolt> General_Kerr: You must be new here.
<Dester> Zecorra is best pony
<Apokalipse> It was good
<brony90> i only know this episode in german.... hope its better in english...
<TrollFace> Lil_B: lazer eyes dammit!
<Apokalipse> I liked it
*Kurra goes get foods!
<TrollFace> brony90: much much better :D
<Meanwhile> Awesome.
*DuskStarshimmer pokes GilDash
<Alchemist> is this have color correction? the colors seem more saturated
<DoctoDoctorWho> Caramel: r u here?
<Lil_B> TrollFace no wonder she's feared than :/
<Dester> Zeccora is best Zebra
<Unnr> Vordox, Galaxy Quest has Alan Rickman in it, QED A Movie.
<Vordox> brony90: Often the original is best
<Michael> zecira ;D
<GilDash> DuskStarshimmer: Holla! :)
<Silverscreen> 01,11As a general rule, I put most comedies on a B list level due to the jokes and comedian's talent being the highlight of the film. This is one of the rare comedy movies that defy that rule, and as such it's one of the rare comedies that I count as an A list film.
<Ninjazz> Liked it.
<mitamaking> Man Twillight sounds off
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Space Jam, not Space Balls sadly.
<TrollFace> Lil_B: yeah, noone likes xman copies
<Kencolt> SpaceBalls is a parody of Star Wars. Galaxy Quest is parody of SF fandom in general.
<Michael> *zecora
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Sounds good.
<mitamaking> Space Jam is fun
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dester: Seing as she's the only Zebra, she's also the worst zebra
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even though Spaceballs > Space Jam.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs are kinda funny, but since they are entirely focused on being a satire rather than making their own original story, I don't think they qualify as an A movie.
<abronylikeyou> Space Jam is great
<Ponies47> Derp!
<Dester> That is the joke
<TPWPFluttershy> <_<
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Agreed too, but still one of the best B Sci Fi movies. :P
<SirTornado> Space Jam's decent.
<Dester> We got the point pinkie
<JESmith71> Nittany_Discord: I think he meant Space Balls was THE ultimate B Sci-Fi film
<Ponies47> Space Jam was a petty good movie :3
<MadSurge> EEEEVIIIIIILLLLLLL
<mitamaking> She's aFrican, hate her
<Bluemario2> hey has anyone seen the message from twlight sparkle one youtube? I would love it if they put that in place of the intro to one of the episodes
<TrollFace> Ponies47: youre a mix betweena hitman and a pony :D
<Dester> SPACE JAM ROCKS
<Lil_B> ok, I'm off until B Movie
<Unnr> Also Galaxy Quest has had most Start Trek actors support it to the point its concidered an unofficial Star Trek film.
<Vordox> As said, a perfect 6/10
<Michael> she's a black magic woman
<Apokalipse> I rated it roll/10

<Kurra> I love how I came to love Galaxy Quest with a buncha neat ponies like y'all. cx Geeks geeking about movie geeking about fandom and its geeking.
<Ponies47> TrollFace: Nope :$
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Don't remind me...

<Kurra> Ponyville is likely in Ontario, or Luxembourg.
<Alchemist> Barbetos|AtWork: thats creepy
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dester: if they dont do it, nothing happens. thats why when weather happens on its own, it is counted off as supernatural

<Kawaii_icybeauti> You know what's funny? Nopony ever told us who voiced Derpy.

<Barbetos|AtWork> Or Apple Jack talking to her self
<Dante> wasn't applejack on zocora?

<MadSurge> abronylikeyou: it's from Civilization 3
<TrollFace> Kandarihu: thank you! :)

<Bluemario2> everyone get food! this is going to be a while
<Kandarihu> TrollFace, that's not a precise date. It could come as much as a month earlier. If it were to be announced today, it could premier on October 20th
<abronylikeyou> What song from Civilization III?

<Kandarihu> It's all speculation, though. Hasbro said that they'll give 4 weeks notice before the S3 premier. And this Thursday, they said that a premier date for S3 will be announced within 30 days. That's 28 now.
<abronylikeyou> We got a real jam going down

<Fl00t4hSh41> if this is 1973 why do they have that terrible 90'ies music playing?
<Silverscreen> 01,11The scuffed basketball used in the film is a treasured souvenir owned by director Joe Pytka. When held by Michael Jordan and other live actors it is real, but whenever it is in flight or controlled by the cartoon characters it is animated.

<abronylikeyou> BIRMINGHAM BARONS

<Meanwhile> They're from a place called Moron Mountain.
<CountDoofus> Trolls Bunny.

<abronylikeyou> Bush during his first term was ok
<Ponies47> They broke the 4th wall!
<Azuredragon> They went Ratchet&Clank on his ass.

<vagineer> the new lola is a psycho stalker
<JESmith71> Until The Looney Tunes Show this was like the only major thing she was in. After that it was just comics, video games, a cameo in the Tweety DTV, *gag*Baby Looney Tunes

<Silverscreen> 01,11Then again, I found the entire new Tunes show to be comepletely and utterly annoying rather than funny. :/
<JESmith71> I think the last time Kath Soucie did Lola before she was replaced by Kristen Wig was in some Six Flags theme park show where she sang Hips Don't Lie with Bugs

<JESmith71> I KNEW it was pony realted
<CCCP> why are they not suprised?
<Silverscreen> 01,11The biggest issue with the looney tunes is that they are so downplayed. They aren't nearly as over-the-top as they are in their original cartoons.
<MaxTheBrony> Ofcourse not
<MaxTheBrony> They are used to this
<MaxTheBrony> They watch TV
<vagineer> lol

This actually happened in 1993, when the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League were established by The Walt Disney Company.
<MaxTheBrony> Alien guy is epic
<Tassadork> trololo
<Azuredragon> The mighty ducks?
<Ponies47> Mickey Mouse

<Kotano> awesome song
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Okay, it was a weird show, but I would consider it an experiment. Like the Korn and wubs thing.
<Vordox> So much variations of critics and ratings from people
<Sinestro> finally the part worth watching
<Silverscreen> 01,11Yeeeaa-no. Five players does not equal shutting down the entire season. It'd be KILLER on the sport and the people involved.
<MaxTheBrony> Dat Taz :3
<RAWRity> Loonatics was just a BIZARRE idea. I mean, who thought Looney Tunes needed a gritty re-imagining?
<jojoyasmin> I find myself to be dancing now
<Mozdoc> And the furries go nuts with sexy bunny.
<Kandarihu> Whatever. It'll just mean the season is extended.
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: Agreed.

<AJIsAwesome> Dester: Ponies.
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In order to fill up the audience from a limited selection of characters, one section was made from actual Looney Tunes. The rest were simply replicated over and over and then "seated" next to each other to create the illusion of a full audience.
<Vordox> YAY
<Dester> YAY!

<Fl00t4hSh41> Michal jordans secret fluids?
<Meanwhile> You know, if they could do that anyway, why didn't they? for toons, they've got really crappy toon logic.
<RAWRity> Tap Water is crystal meth in a bottle in Looney Tunes world.
<Kandarihu> Last night, we were all calling this steroid abuse
<DerpyMuffins> I still think its Pinkie Juice
<Fl00t4hSh41> Why would they want to drink his special fluids?
<Lil_B> I was actually thinking about Drugs or Steroids ...
<Vordox> MUSIC
<StinkomanFan> At least Daffy Duck lampshaded it.
<Dester> So no one there has a problem with taking steroid/ ie cheat?
<Crippler> Winners do drugs.
<Dusty> grrrr

<Ponies47> MEn in Balck
<Kandarihu> Fl00t4hSh41, Bugs made it look like the only reason that Michael Jordan was so good was because of secret drugs. That's the "Michael's Secret Stuff"
<Lil_B> Silverscreen its the reverse wilee coyotee effect
<Vordox> Jiggly Butt
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Crippler> dur hur
<Michael> owned
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dat plot
<RAWRity> did somebody really ask how they never score by "throwing"?
<Ponies47> Dat plot
<DerpyMuffins> He mooned half the court
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kandarihu: Still sounded like a metaphor for his semen
<Vordox> Pepe Le Pew Suprise go!

<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Vordox> I love this joke :D
<Dester> I'm trying to find where to sign up for the newsletter, I guess I'm blind

<Dester> So the aliens are cartoons, made b y aliens then?
<Tassadork> horrifying
<JESmith71> Wait, Bugs and the gang are worried about losing because they have to do the same crap over and over at a theme park? They already do that in real life at Six Flags.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Why don't the aliens just steal jordans talent?
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, but they lacked confidence in their abilities, and were intimidated by the Monstarrs. That's why the placebo ploy was needed.
<Dashee> So have i missed anything good the past 2 weeks?
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Daffy
<Moopy> Fuckin creepers keep blowing up near me on minecraft on the xbox
<MaxTheBrony> Dat Lola <3
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: Jordan didnt know they would need any special motivation
<vagineer> this is the scene that lola mostly had personality.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dat save
<Michael> poor bugs
<Fl00t4hSh41> And the female character has to be saved from a menacing villian
<MaxTheBrony> :3
<DerpyMuffins> Looks like he got squished like a bug
<JESmith71> They have these stupid stage shows with costumed LT characters singing Pop Songs. Like they have Slyvester and Tweety singing Lady Gaga and Lola and Bugs singing Hips Don't Lie
<Fl00t4hSh41> So much for female empowerment
<Vordox> Huyuek

<FlaschenJoe11> And Lola went from 1-Dimensional to 2 Dimensional Character.
<DerpyMuffins> We never saw road runner play
<vagineer> but still not 3 dimensional
<Vordox> FlaschenJoe11: While Michael is still less then 1 :P
<CCCP> :o
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Lil_B> I think we are still missing that one perticular character...
<Silverscreen> 01,11They should have had someone from Galaxy Quest and Who Framed Roger Rabit working on this.
<MaxTheBrony> vagineer imposebru
<Moopy> i've seen this like a couple times when i was a kid back then
<Kandarihu> Fl00t4hSh41, female empowerment or treating a lady like a lady? Does female empowerment mean letting her come to harm?
<Michael> lawl
<AJIsAwesome> I don't think you want his "secret stuff". :S
<Azuredragon> You are dead, not big surprise
<DerpyMuffins> Stan doesnt do anything and is already sweating

<Deadlypon3> Jordan Reaction shot :P
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kandarihu: The heroine being menaced by an antagonist and needing to be saved by a male hero is an old schauvanistic cliche

<Silverscreen> 01,11he's practically a cartoon character himself.
<Ponies47> brb
<Moopy> i know this guy he was off the movie show umm oz mozez Jones or something
<Meanwhile> He's a better cartoon than Lola at any rate.
<AJIsAwesome> So they should "dominate that hole", huh? :S
<RAWRity> here's the explanation for Bill Murray being here
<MaxTheBrony> producers xD
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kandarihu: Empty bluster. She still needs a man to save her from the villian
<Dester> Anybody know where I can see the The Room? I love cult classic bad films
<Vordox> So...
<DerpyMuffins> The Producers got him in
<Vordox> Bill Murray can break the 4th wall with NO effort?
<MaxTheBrony> 4th wall doesnt exist in this movie :)
<Silverscreen> 01,11Play fair?
<Kotano> Dester : It should be on youtube
<MaxTheBrony> Its not existant :p
<Silverscreen> 01,11Has he been watching this game?
<RAWRity> Fl00t4hSh41: or rather, to push her out of the way of the villains fat ass
<Dester> or in mlp
<Sinestro> Marvin then blew up Moron Mountian
<Lil_B> Vordox YES! you got the Plan :P
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Don't worry, he had a beak

<Moopy> Hey silverscreen you streaming?

<Kandarihu> Fl00t4hSh41, if this were a prolonged situation (being abducted and taken to the villain's castle), it would clearly be a case of sexism. But this was a brief instance

<Lil_B> MaxTheBrony ikr?
<Dester> MJ is like Pinkie
<DerpyMuffins> Not only does Jordan break Physics but llogic as well
<CountDoofus> If any game is even remotely scary, I'm not playing it. Not for a million bits.
<MaxTheBrony> but ofcourse i had Giggle at the ghosties in the background all the time so maybe thats why, but still its a very badly made game .
<Kawaii_icybeauti> let's beat these yolks and save my folks by baking the fourth wall!
<Agent_47> MJ can slow down time
<Kandarihu> Dangit, Fl00t4hSh41! I wanted to make a Chaos Dunk joke, but I was busy typing out my response during the entire relevant time.

<Silverscreen> 01,11okay, so my review...
<RAWRity> so, that was SPACE JAM
<Silverscreen> 01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: To kids this seems like a pretty good movie. You got sports, you got cartoons, and you got stupid silly things. But as an adult? It's pretty lame. Jordon's acting is sub-par to say the best, the looney tunes humor is horribly downplayed, and it's even worse when the two are combined. It's sad that the live action has better comedy than the characters that are
<RAWRity> COME ON AND SLAM
<Silverscreen> 1,11MEANT to be comedic. The story is pretty lame too, and the movie as a whole suffers from having stuff just not being over-the-top like it should. The only way it's good is through one's nostalgic goggles, reeking heavily of the 90’s scent.
<Silverscreen> 01,11The animation is nice, though, and I honestly wish the Nerdlucks/Monstars became regular Tunes because they’re so original. The soundtrack, needless to say, is awesome, and Bill Murray is always hilarious. However, those are minor and not nearly enough to save what’s wrong with this movie. 4/10.

<CountDoofus> Haio flutterchu
<CCCP> hi Applejack2011
<Michael> ohai flutterchu

<GilDash> PONY: Actually, ill for once. Got a cold right now. XD
<Vordox> WOMAn
<Vordox> ANGRY
<Facecake> Angry wife
<Facecake> :3
<MaxTheBrony> Is Allicorns known for being Old?
<twilight_sprinkle> and then celestia stole all our food!...but we rebuilt, and thats how ponyville was made
<alexxm> wife is not impressed
<MaxTheBrony> i dont know the lore about the allicorns
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Fl00t4hSh41> yup. Celestia knew the perfect place for them to settle
<TheMaster> all will possibly be settled in season 3
<Dken2021_> MaxTheBrony to the fanfiction library!
<TheMaster> celestia might just be special because sun=really old
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<Dovah> isn't alicorn also what a unicorns horn is made out of?
<PONY> GilDash: oh, I know that feeling, when I woke up from mz 15 hour nap, it was 15 degrees in mz room :/
<Fl00t4hSh41> Right between the gate to tartatrus and a giant magical forest full of monsters
<MaxTheBrony> But who created Celestia !?
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<twilight_sprinkle> TheMaster: so she will die with the sun? thats a pretty cool idea actually
<Fl00t4hSh41> The best place to live for sure
<TheMaster> billions of years later
<MaxTheBrony> Dammit y u kid show bring me so much un logical questions
<Dashee> I might try to make something like zap apples for halloween this year
<GilDash> PONY: No, I mean I've got a virus. Had it for the past couple of days.
<Sinestro> >the chicken or the egg agruement
<Dashee> ahh dogs barking brb
<Vordox> MaxTheBrony: Lauren Faust created Celestia
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder how many ponies got torn to shreds by them
<PONY> GilDash, ye dzing or something mate :P
<MaxTheBrony> Vordox good answer xD
<TheMaster> where did celestia come from? well when one pony loves another pony verrrrrry much
<GilDash> PONY: "dzing"? :S
<Michael> omg
<Michael> that was fast
<MaxTheBrony> Were the Dinoponies?
<MaxTheBrony> xD

<twilight_sprinkle> wish making my food was that fast
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, perhaps Celestia and Luna were born during Discord's rule.
<alexxm> well that escaulated quickly
<PONY> pardon the keyboard
<CountDoofus> Sinestro: Easy. It's called evolution. The egg was first, which was laid by the predecessor of the chicken as we know it today.
<TheMaster> just wait for the season 3 episode that addresses it
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> Young Granny Smith Soldier
<GilDash> PONY: Hardly dying. Gonna take more then a cold to keep this pony down. ^_^
<TheMaster> apparently jon de lancie is reprising his role, other than breaking free from his prison again, it can only be a history episode
