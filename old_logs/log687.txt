<CriticKitten> Well, Michael Bay's movies are designed to be incredibly easy to digest. See, Transformers has a simple formula: Autobots are ignored despite all evidence to the contrary, shit goes down, Autobots save the day. Throw in copious amounts of AMERICA military hardware moments and the occasional dumb glance from the female lead and Shia.

<LunasGuard> :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14sadly, not yet, ASoftFluffyThing
<Canadian_Brony> ASoftFluffyThing if they did, the internet would be exploding.
<LunasGuard> :[
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aww
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's why i went to the panel to see if they announced something
<cachi01> ASoftFluffyThing: they said there was going to be an announcement in november
<cachi01> JUST AN ANNOUNCEMENT
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so you guys could know right away >.<
<Canadian_Brony> FUUUUUU-
<ASoftFluffyThing> cachi01, I know in November but specificallya date
<Canadian_Brony> But I want it NAAAOOOO

<cachi01> on the hub
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but yeah, based on the panel, S3's in good hands ^_^
<Jmo> aw you Saxy.
<Jmo> So caring
<LunasGuard> this Schnuffel Bunny is the next crazyfrog
<cachi01> and on ltin america season 2 premieres december 3 :I
<thelonepony> so, whats the hispanic version of the hub cachi01
<Laurayne> hello everypony...
<cachi01> yes season 2
<cachi01> not 3
<thelonepony> Hi Laurayne
<Jmo> 'ello Laurayne
<cachi01> thelonepony: fucking
<LunasGuard> ello Laurayne
<cachi01> discovery
<cachi01> kids...
<Canadian_Brony> speaking of November, I shave now, so I can participate in Movember
<Canadian_Brony> which is one big excuse to not shave for an entire month
<Canadian_Brony> hi Laurayne
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Laurayne! :)
<Canadian_Brony> what, don't you get Movember in the states?
<cachi01> Moovember?
<Canadian_Brony> no Movember
<ASoftFluffyThing> Movember?
<NocturnalBlade> hi Laurayne
<Laurayne> my parents are fighting....
*NocturnalBlade hugs Laurayne "it'll be ok"
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs Laurayne
<therainbowvortex> hugs Laurayne are you okay
<cachi01> thx god my prents are divorced
*AJIsAwesome hugs Laurayne
<thelonepony> :(
<Laurayne> im okay... it probably doesnt bother me as much as it should anymore... im just tired...
<Canadian_Brony> ASoftFluffyThing yeah. On the first day of November, every guy across the country who participates (almost everyone who can) shaves their face clean. They don't shave for the rest of the month. You do it to support some research stuff I don't remember from last year. Most of the guys around my school find it as a good excuse not to shave for an entire month
<Canadian_Brony> which is good for me because I shave once a week
<NocturnalBlade> dat wall
<ASoftFluffyThing> Canadian_Brony, ohhh
<cachi01> but not shaving causes Meanwhile mustaches
<Canadian_Brony> is he here?
<Laurayne> im just glad im still liveing with them since im the only one that can stop my dad from going too far... that said, i know my mom is completely at fault...
<Canadian_Brony> . . . no
<ASoftFluffyThing> Not shaving makes my face itchy
<Canadian_Brony> damn

<therainbowvortex> cachi01: so how did u become a brony
<Kurra> PB&J is such a TASTY thing to say
<cachi01> therainbowvortex: every vid i watched i dont know why but the PONY.movs were always on the recommendations
<AJIsAwesome> therainbowvortex: I call it Peanut Butter and Jelly. :S
<cachi01> therainbowvortex: so i watched apples,dress and shed and i loled so freking hard but then i found the word brony in one of the comments
<therainbowvortex> AJIsAwesome: wait what ?:O

<Magical_Pablez94> hahahaha
<Jmo> ew Raisin Bran
<Magical_Pablez94> poor little thing....
<DoctoDoctorWho> My master took care of her soon enough
<Magical_Pablez94> master?
<Jmo> ..Don't ask
<Gold_Demona> >.>
<Magical_Pablez94> too late....
<Magical_Pablez94> is that sumi wrek or who?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dont you know? I've devoted myself to service under Lord Saturn
<DoctoDoctorWho> caps neccesary
<Magical_Pablez94> ah Saturn! that silly silly.... XD
<Magical_Pablez94> filly *
<Gold_Demona> filly? But he a dude
<Magical_Pablez94> yeah i know is just an expression.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Its the least I can do, He was the one who fixed my BS issues
<Magical_Pablez94> oh well...
<Gold_Demona> You had BS issues?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Im pretty sure filly is gender neutral, like kid.
<DoctoDoctorWho> and yes
<Gold_Demona> Pretty sure Filly is female equivalent of colt.
<Jmo> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> For some reason I was banned b4 I even got on the site, Saturn cleared that all up
<Magical_Pablez94> DoctoDoctorWho demona is right. foal is genderless.
<Gold_Demona> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> Imma go check
<Magical_Pablez94> hahahaha that not trusting.... XD
<Gold_Demona> A foal is a baby horse. The females are fillies, and the males are colts.
<Jmo> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> damn you logic, DAMN YOU ALL!
<Magical_Pablez94> stallion and mares are the relative grown up stadium.
*DoctoDoctorWho mopes cuz he was wrong

<Gold_Demona> :)
<Magical_Pablez94> :3
*Gold_Demona hugs Magical_Pablez94 back
<DoctoDoctorWho> I think it can still be used on males tho, like when you walk up to a group of girl-friends and say "hey guys"
<Jmo> wat.
<Gold_Demona> The only time I've ever heard a bunch of guys beings called "girls" is if it's by a drill sergeant. :P
<Magical_Pablez94> indeed, though i approach girls saying "hi girls!"
<Gold_Demona> "ALRIGHT, LADIES! LISTEN UP!!!"

<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<Gold_Demona> "Warning: This episode of Lupin the 3rd The Abridged Series contains humor about Nazis. So if you are offended by Nazis, then please stop watching. BUT if you're like the rest of us, who find Nazis hilarious, then... Enjoy!"
<DoctoDoctorWho> Have a good sleep NewSuperBronyU|Zzz, Ill be waiting 4 you.
<Magical_Pablez94> DoctoDoctorWho i have a pretty deep respect of life. anyone that makes jokes about someone's death is just not respectful of those lives.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I can take nazi jokes. They deserve nothing but mocking :D
<Gold_Demona> lol, yup
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: Come on man, nazi humor is way out of Mein Kampfort zone
<MadSurge> So, what's the episode about Gold_Demona? Nazi gold?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: To be exact, Hitler's legacy
<Magical_Pablez94> don't misunderstand me. i can take those jokes, i just get a bit sick of them if i hear 20 or 30 jokes like that in a row.
<MadSurge> Ahhhh
<DoctoDoctorWho> I only have like, 12
<MadSurge> Magical_Pablez94: Well yeah, agreed
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: In the actual episode, Lupin and the gang find it, and it's just all of Hitler's childhood doodles. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah, thought so :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: In the abridged series, it's a bunch of really bad anime fanfiction. XD
<Magical_Pablez94> ok that must be hilarious then XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> this isnt Reich, we should Gestappo and jew know it.

<Gold_Demona> Hiyo The_Engineer
<JunkerKun> The_Engineer: Hey! Need a dispencer here!
<The_Engineer> Junker I'm TCR Engineer
<The_Engineer> No can do
<JunkerKun> The_Engineer: Doh...
<DoctoDoctorWho> TCR?
<The_Engineer> TCR/True capitalist radio
<DoctoDoctorWho> drawing a blank
<Gold_Demona> Never heard of it
<Jmo> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> Magical_Pablez94: Are you pro Solar Empire or NLR?
<The_Engineer> Meh
<The_Engineer> I'll give you link to the wiki o TCR
<Gold_Demona> Neither. I hate polotics
<Jmo> ^
<Magical_Pablez94> .....what is that?
<The_Engineer> but it died at may 2012
<DoctoDoctorWho> :O
<The_Engineer> http://truecapitalist.wikia.com/wiki/TCR
<Magical_Pablez94> DoctoDoctorWho sorry my ignorance.. but it maybe is called differently here in Italy.
<JunkerKun> DoctoDoctorWho: New Solar Repire is cool
<DoctoDoctorWho> One of the biggest contravorcies(fuck spelling) in the brony community.
<The_Engineer> Btw TCR is 4chan trolling a guy whose a racist and hates bronies but hes funny :P
<Gold_Demona> I've never liked the "Solar Empire/Lunar Republic" thing
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: now there's a cool version of Spitting Image on italian cable, I can follow politics there :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> JunkerKun: I am fine with the current double ruling, I just want to know the side people would be on if war broke out between the 2
<Jmo> Lol'd
<Gold_Demona> In that case, I vote Cadence
<JunkerKun> DoctoDoctorWho: My guess is that there will be no war unless BOTH of princesses vanish or die
<Jmo> Flawed.
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: neutral
<Magical_Pablez94> what the hell are solar empire and lunar republic?
<Jmo> You don't wanna know.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Text wall inbound
<The_Engineer> I want to
<The_Engineer> know what you guys
<JunkerKun> Magical_Pablez94: Meh, nevermind this
<The_Engineer> are playing
<MadSurge> Magical_Pablez94: the hipothetical sides if war broke between the two alicorns
*Mega_Milk is part of the solar empire
<Magical_Pablez94> nono i mind! i wanna know!
<Magical_Pablez94> oh.
<JunkerKun> Magical_Pablez94: Just a silly pseudopolitical thing in our little pony world
<Gold_Demona> Magical_Pabllez94: Pretty much a thing in the fanbase about "What if Celestia and Luna went to war with each other"
<Magical_Pablez94> ......i will just say a little thing then....
<Magical_Pablez94> i love LUNA!!!!!!
<MadSurge> I love both princesses really
<MadSurge> Even Cadance is cool
<Magical_Pablez94> and quite dislike that celestia for banishing her.
<JunkerKun> Magical_Pablez94: And we all love Molestia, sure
<JunkerKun> =)
<Magical_Pablez94> oh well!
<Gold_Demona> If we're putting them in a political light, I vote for Cadence, cuz she's the unloved third party.
<Magical_Pablez94> you are right JunkerKun ! XD
<Gold_Demona> Crystal Ponies ftw
<Magical_Pablez94> hahahaha Gold_Demona
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: Meh, Cadence is a neutral side
<Gold_Demona> Whatever they are
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: But that just another reason to vote for her
<Magical_Pablez94> Gold_Demona totally agree
<GriffinCherry> Gold_Demona: crystal ponies. Apparently a race of ponies going to occure in the third season. :P
<Gold_Demona> Yeah I know
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm noticing an increasing interest toward Steampunk in the community
<DoctoDoctorWho> The entire contravorcy is based off those who think luna was cheated and deserves the throne(New Lunar Republic) and the loyalists who like celestia being in power(Solar Empire). There is this unlikly rumor that an uprising will soon happen where Luna attempts a coup de etat of the throne and overthrow celestia. LONG LIVE THE SOLAR EMPIRE!!!
<Gold_Demona> But we've yet to see what a "crystal pony" is cuz the season isn't out yet
<MadSurge> Steampunk is cool
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: spoilers came out yesterday, now we know!
<JunkerKun> http://pixelkitties.deviantart.com/art/Handsome-Jack-s-Diamond-Pony-328292437
<JunkerKun> THIS is a crystal pony
<Magical_Pablez94> FUN FACT: i have a second OC, which is female who i named Crystal. two days after that i created it, crystal ponies spoiler came out.
<GriffinCherry> Gold_Demona: Maybe it's like the collectables?
<Gold_Demona> lol JunkerKun
<Gold_Demona> GriffinCherry? All transparent and glittery?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Magical_Pablez94: understand now?
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 Pssst S3 spoilers or speculation stuff is not discussed i think so be careful
<GriffinCherry> Gold_Demona: Possibly. We'll have to see.
<JunkerKun> BTW, in Mechromancer DLC there are skills that named after quotes from MLP
<Gold_Demona> Oh yeah, Spoilers not allowed here. Sorry. >.>
<JunkerKun> Such as "Discord" or "20% cooler"
<Gold_Demona> I shut up now
*Jmo pats Gold_Demona
<DoctoDoctorWho> shame on all of you, spoilers bad.
<Magical_Pablez94> killerpony7733 i don't think that i actually said something about s3 did i?
<CrimsonPhoenix> killerpony7733, you think?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: nope, bannable offense
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not allowed period
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 Yeah but the crystal ponies weren't that speculation based on some info?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Magical_Pablez94, actually you did
<DoctoDoctorWho> Instant permaban, no warning
<Magical_Pablez94> no i didn't.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: That's why I just said there are new spoilers
<Gold_Demona> And ten years dungeon
<DaringDerpy> hello :)
<MadSurge> Only 10? :D
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DaringDerpy
<MadSurge> Ohai DaringDerpy!
<Gold_Demona> Oops missing a zero
<Magical_Pablez94> i said crystal ponies came out of the internet after i created an OC named Crystal. no big deal.
<Gold_Demona> 100 years dungeon
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: 7 years no trials?
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: And the the emperor comes into your chamber to escape from the enemies

<JunkerKun> Magical_Pablez94: Mechacorn?
<Magical_Pablez94> kind of XD
<JunkerKun> Magical_Pablez94: Like corn but with wings? X)
<Gold_Demona> Machacorn? Wouldn't that mean "mechanical horn"?
<GriffinCherry> DoctoDoctorWho: He din't live. He died uhm... where'd he die again...
<TheRandomkid321> SO mates. How much longer until the lottery winners are chosen?
<Magical_Pablez94> hahahaha nope! XD
*TheRandomkid321 licks AdamTheDuck
<DoctoDoctorWho> GriffinCherry: exactly, he got away
<TheRandomkid321> HA HA! I GOT YOU!
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<GriffinCherry> DoctoDoctorWho: Wait a sec... Checking it out ATM.
*Magical_Pablez94 is a mechalicorn. :3
<AdamTheDuck> Preemptive licks are best type of licks :<
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo TheRandomkid321
<TheRandomkid321> Hey
*AdamTheDuck noms TheRandomkid321 instead
<TheRandomkid321> So does anyone know when the lottery winners are drawn?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Still cant find a decent name 4 my OC

<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturday

<Gold_Demona> Lottery's always on Saturday
<Magical_Pablez94> ^
<TheRandomkid321> DoctoDocterWho Mines name is Thought SPeed.
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, ooh, I like names, give me a description
<CrimsonPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, may I have a picture?
*JunkerKun Preemptively licks AdamTheDuck
<TheRandomkid321> Saturday american or australian?
<Gold_Demona> My OC's name is Whimsy Floof. :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> k, Ill describe him, gimme a min
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Does it matter?
<Magical_Pablez94> yay! OC pictures time!!
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: And I am Isildur, the king of Gondor
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demoma Yes. Australian saturday is friday to you americans.
<Gold_Demona> JunkerKun: Where was Gondor when the changlings came? D:<
<Gold_Demona> changelings*
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: I dunno. Sleeping perhaps
<CrimsonPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, describe?
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: Just like Luna
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Phase4> is there stream?
<CrimsonPhoenix> you don't have a picture?
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Nope. No stream
<Phase4> Sumica, Ping
*AdamTheDuck licks Phase4 :P
<Gold_Demona> Didn't he go to bed?
<killerpony7733> Phase4 Streams free so no worries
<killerpony7733> Gold_Demona Yep he did
<Gold_Demona> I thought so
<GriffinCherry> DoctoDoctorWho: Wrong. Nobody survived reach. If Jun had lived, he'd be mentioned somewhere in the afterwords. No-one of the Noble team survived Reach.
<DoctoDoctorWho> He is a large steel grey unicorn stallion, a tad shorter than celestia. He has a dark blue mane and tail with a large informative book as his cutie mark. Im trying to incorporate the word Steel into his name.
<Magical_Pablez94> brb!!
<JunkerKun> GriffinCherry: Well, in the end he was fighting Covenants all alone, so I don't think he survived
<JunkerKun> GriffinCherry: Ah wait
<TheRandomkid321> I'm gonna post a pic of my OC. Thought Streaks. http://i1075.photobucket.com/albums/w433/TheRandomkid321/Screenshot2012-09-03at45624PM.png
<GriffinCherry> JunkerKun: That was Six
<JunkerKun> GriffinCherry: It was number 6
<DoctoDoctorWho> GriffinCherry: but jun left with cortana and the doctor!
<Gold_Demona> That's pretty cool TheRandomkid321
<Gold_Demona> For a ponycreator pony
<GriffinCherry> DoctoDoctorWho: Cortana was escorted by Six, silly. He went to escort the doctor to another place.
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona Trust me if I could draw him I WOULD
<Magical_Pablez94> back~
<killerpony7733> I got a ref sheet of my OC and all. But i only shared it with a few people and with my boyfriend :P
<AdamTheDuck> Yay stream
<MadSurge> :O
<DoctoDoctorWho> GriffinCherry: but jun left on the dropship
<MadSurge> Phase4! :D
<Gold_Demona> And Phase stream
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona Trust me. If I could draw him. I WOULD!
<TheRandomkid321> :D
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: I hear ya. =)
<GriffinCherry> DoctoDoctorWho: What dropship?
<Gold_Demona> I've only managed to draw mine a couple times.
<Gold_Demona> Most of my pictures of my OC are Desktop pony sprites. >.>
<Magical_Pablez94> http://imgur.com/a/KAaNA
<Magical_Pablez94> my 2 OC <3
<DoctoDoctorWho> GriffinCherry: the pelican they were on when 6 gave cortana to keys, did you even play the game?
<Magical_Pablez94> the 2nd is just the version before i met my gf ..:3
<CrimsonPhoenix> an alicorn?
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 A alicorn? really
<CrimsonPhoenix> why?
<Jmo> LOL
<Magical_Pablez94> killerpony7733 CrimsonPhoenix not exactly
<Jmo> Here we go
<CrimsonPhoenix> alright for the color design
<CrimsonPhoenix> but still stick to one race
<Phase4> stupid broken windows terminals
<killerpony7733> What CrimsonPhoenix said
<CrimsonPhoenix> the unicorn part would be enough
<CrimsonPhoenix> also too tall
<CrimsonPhoenix> and slender
<GriffinCherry> DoctoDoctorWho: I've probably played the game many more times than you, mister! I haven't played it in a while and Jun was not there.
<Gold_Demona> Here's mine. http://fav.me/d49quz1
<DoctoDoctorWho> He made a non alicorn version guys, cooloff
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix killerpony7733 i technically am an unicorn, but my gf, which talent is build mechanical stuff, built me mecha wings and so... here i am.
<GriffinCherry> DoctoDoctorWho: He didn't get away with the dropship.
<Phase4> anyone here know apache?
<CrimsonPhoenix> then draw mecha wings
<DoctoDoctorWho> GriffinCherry: we will finish this tomorrow
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix i CAN'T DRAW
<Phase4> not many people here are there
<DoctoDoctorWho> I must leave now
<Jmo> >_>
<Phase4> anyone got magicka?
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix THOUGH WINGS ARE COVERED IN NORMAL FUR AND FEATHERS.
<Gold_Demona> Magical_Pablez94 Ponycreator has mechanical wings
<Magical_Pablez94> why caps?
<JunkerKun> Phase4: Me
<Jmo> NEEDS MORE CAPS
<Phase4> JMO: INDEED"
<JunkerKun> Phase4: Why?
<DoctoDoctorWho> GOODBYE BRONYSTATE!!!
<Phase4> JunkerKun, might start a game
<Phase4> later DoctoDoctorWho
<JunkerKun> DoctoDoctorWho: Bye
<AdamTheDuck> Bye DoctoDoctorWho :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Magical_Pablez94, 1 what Gold_Demona said
<GriffinCherry> DoctoDoctorWho: Why tomorrow? Too scared that you might loose an argument?
*DoctoDoctorWho hugs all the ponies
<JunkerKun> Phase4: Oh. No, sorry, last time we tried to play it my PC crashed three times
<Phase4> ah
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix Gold_Demona those are just shitty, and those wings are covered in fur and feathers.
<DoctoDoctorWho> GriffinCherry: and no, I have to leave for class
<JunkerKun> Phase4: Probably has nothing to do with Magicka, but still
<Phase4> 20121012214328 << need to remember this number
<GriffinCherry> Phase4: Hoi. Play minecraft!
<Magical_Pablez94> Phase4 what is that?
<Jmo> Write it down?
<Phase4> Magical_Pablez94, timestamp
<GriffinCherry> DoctoDoctorWho: Okay.
<Phase4> i've been hacking apache
<CrimsonPhoenix> Magical_Pablez94, 2 unless you have a disability, everyone can make a line, everyone hold a pencil so yes everyone can draw
<Phase4> doing some really bad things with .htaccess files
<Phase4> this is another idea
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: btw very pretty OC
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix i can't draw properly.
<CrimsonPhoenix> how good that drawing is depends on how long you keep on drawing
<Gold_Demona> Magical_Pablez94: But... steampunk wings are cool. >.>
<JunkerKun> CrimsonPhoenix: That's saying too rough
<Phase4> its absolutely terrible and i should be shot for coming up with it
<Magical_Pablez94> Gold_Demona i just don't like em XD
<GriffinCherry> Gold_Demona: did you draw that?
<Gold_Demona> GriffinCherry: Yup
<CrimsonPhoenix> JunkerKun, too rough?
<killerpony7733> Gold_Demona Wait wat? i didn't see jack
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Thanks. :)
<GriffinCherry> Gold_Demona: Nice. :p
<JunkerKun> CrimsonPhoenix: But you are right, as long as you are able to draw a line, you are drawing
<killerpony7733> Gold_Demona Mind giving a link to what you drew
<Gold_Demona> killerpony7733: http://fav.me/d49quz1
<Gold_Demona> Ish my poneh
<JunkerKun> CrimsonPhoenix: Eh, don't remember how to say it in english. Just nevermind me =)
<killerpony7733> Ah that's pretty well done
<killerpony7733> Gold_Demona Also yay pegasi! :D
<Phase4> and then virtualbox got all confuse
<CrimsonPhoenix> JunkerKun, I think you missed the part where I said that how good your drawings are depends on how long you keep on drawing
<Magical_Pablez94> killerpony773
<Gold_Demona> Yesh pegasus. :3
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 Hmm?
<JunkerKun> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh. Sorry then
<Magical_Pablez94> killerpony7733 sorry , send utton is worst button
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 Haha
<TheRandomkid321> You know what I think? I think it's high time someone went and made another Pony Creator. One that has dozens of options. And not just copy pastes from the show. And one that contantly gets updated unlike the current one by General Zoi which is abandoned.
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix killerpony7733 i still don't understand what people has against alicorn OCs...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Mary-sue
<Gold_Demona> Magical_Pablez94: alicorns are OP
<TheRandomkid321> Magical_Pabelz I just... Just dont thik it's right unless it fits into the storyline. Yes I'm a "lore nut" as some say
<JunkerKun> TheRandomkid321: Well, I can try, but do you really need a Pony Creator made in Game Maker? =)
<Magical_Pablez94> Gold_Demona I am overpower!
<CrimsonPhoenix> people overblowing thei OC making them OP so they won't have any trouble in their RP mind
<CrimsonPhoenix> also it doesn't fit the MLP world
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: OP?
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix i am fair on RP. i hardly ever act impossible losing.
<Gold_Demona> JunkerKun: OverPowered
<TheRandomkid321> JunkerKun I guess. But what's Gmae Maker anyway?
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: Oh
*AdamTheDuck licks Ponies47
<killerpony7733> And for example alicorns in MLP FIM lore is a royal sub species of all ponies
<killerpony7733> Also some of the relations to luna and celestia.....god no
<JunkerKun> TheRandomkid321: Meh, just a game creation programm
<Gold_Demona> Alicorns are royalty and that's it.
<TheRandomkid321> JunkerKun Any good?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Magical_Pablez94, you're getting desperate to make us approve your OC
<Jmo> klrpwny pls i r son of luna
<CrimsonPhoenix> why?
<Gold_Demona> lol Jmo
<JunkerKun> TheRandomkid321: Quite good. As long as you learn it's programming language which is quite easy
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix i am telling the truth
<TheRandomkid321> Jmo Dictionary mate. Look it up.
<Jmo> LOL
<Jmo> Get off the internet.
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, he intentionally writes like that :P
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix i have been roleplaying since i poot hoof in this chat and i've never been OP
<Magical_Pablez94> put*
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 Problem is it's in established lore that alicorns are royal and very powerful and as far as most alicorn OC's go they are somehow magically related to either luna or celestia and....really just no...most you see is uncreative and very very badly done
<CrimsonPhoenix> Roleplaying in this chat?
<TheRandomkid321> JunkerKun Okay then. Try it if you want.
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah no
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321 It called bein funneh
<CrimsonPhoenix> we do not RP here
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona Oh you speak german too?
<CrimsonPhoenix> if you continue you will get warned if not banned
<Magical_Pablez94> killerpony7733 I AM NO ALICORN DAMMIT!
<Mega_Milk> I dont think Alicorns are OP. But it seems like almost everyone makes there OC and alicorn. So it kinda takes the Rare-ness out of seeing one.
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 Did i say so?
<Phase4> 20121012214328
<Phase4> 20121012110819
<Phase4> DAMNIT
<Magical_Pablez94> killerpony7733 i am a unicorn with mechanical wings
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Huh? No. What made you think I know German? O_o
<Phase4> hours are wrong
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Dat phase language....
<Magical_Pablez94> killerpony7733 IS FUCKING DIFFERENT
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, is timestamps
<Jmo> Wow calm down
<Magical_Pablez94> >:I
<Kandarihu> Perhaps a Pony Creator that allows mane/tail customization would be good.
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona You just said Broken Toilet in german mate XD
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 Calm down man calm down
<CrimsonPhoenix> Magical_Pablez94, calm down dude
<Magical_Pablez94> killerpony7733 CrimsonPhoenix i love my Oc.. :I
<AdamTheDuck> >.>
<JunkerKun> TheRandomkid321: Nah. I think the main advantage of Flash is that you use vectors instead of images. In Game maker you can use only images and primitives
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Lovely OC mate lovely.
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: ....ooooook
<CrimsonPhoenix> I despise the OC I made
<Magical_Pablez94> midny!
*Magical_Pablez94 glomps Midnight_Stormwing
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 I was not even making such a hint or anything. Just explaining the reason why people dislike fanon alicorns not saying yours is knowing the mechinal wing thing
<Gold_Demona> Magical_Pablez94: Thing is, you can be different without being ridiculous
<Phase4> i like how 24 hour and 12 hour makes no difference
<JunkerKun> Kandarihu: The best Pony maker to allow that is GIMP X)
<Gold_Demona> Alicorn OCs are just ridiculous
<TheRandomkid321> If anyone has artistic talents and won't mind drawing my OC. Never gonna happen though
<killerpony7733> Magical_Pablez94 Don't assume i was being hostile against you...
<Gold_Demona> Cuz more often than not they're not practical
<Magical_Pablez94> killerpony7733 looks like Gold_Demona is
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Isnt there like a number diffrenve? Like there is a 13:00 in 24 hour time right?
<Phase4> 24 hour is the same as 12 hour except it doesnt jump back midway
<AdamTheDuck> So much hostility in tonight's chat >.>
<Jmo> Dis is gud entertainment.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yours is still a pwetty pony :3
<Gold_Demona> Magical_Pablez94: I'm not being hostile at you personally. Just alicorn OCs in general.
<Mega_Milk> Here's something else I dont get. Why do I have red text in phase's chat??? -lol
<Phase4> where did phasepony go
<Jmo> Meanwhile Phase4 is just playing with his codin'
<Gold_Demona> I can't stand 'em
<AdamTheDuck> Nuuuu, not Phasepony :<
<Magical_Pablez94> Gold_Demona i. am. not. an. alicorn.
<Jmo> HAHA
<TheRandomkid321> Mega_Milk THERE CAN ONLY BE OOONE!
<Gold_Demona> Magical_Pablez94: You look like one. Close enough
<Mega_Milk> Now im blue :D
<TheRandomkid321> Wait no you're good
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: do you follow Bad Pony OCs? :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Nope
<Magical_Pablez94> Gold_Demona i were born as unicorn and will ever be. though i have those mecha wings
<Magical_Pablez94> no lunch time
<Magical_Pablez94> cya'll later
<TheRandomkid321> Mega_Milk You're in the ban scope
<killerpony7733> Gold_Demona However i respect ones choice. But that does not mean i dislike their choice of OC. Respect person on person level as for RP or the OC part i dislike em
<Jmo> browniestate stahp.
<AdamTheDuck> Stahp!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Magical_Pablez94, between you and me I would enjoy it if your pony had actual mecha looking wing rather than flesh-like looking
<TheRandomkid321> I don't mind alicorn OCs if they have those mechanicl wings but normally I don't rally like 'em
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: http://badponyocs.tumblr.com/ :D so... tacky!
<killerpony7733> Jmo butt itz gud topiz
<CrimsonPhoenix> but that's just my opinion
<AdamTheDuck> Gais srsly, dis bsns needs to stahp.
<Jmo> nu it isnt klrpwny
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No thanks. :I
<Magical_Pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix not my fault. smelt created it that way. can't do anything against it.
<JunkerKun> MadSurge: Oh. Mah. Gawd.

<JunkerKun> Phase4: I did that. After I understood that PHP is not my thing. And after I've spent one last day to actually do my project
<Phase4> JunkerKun, for short examples its fine, sometimes, but for anything more complex it becomes edge cases on edge cases
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, it had stealth and sniping. My two favourite fps themes.
<Jmo> Seems like a mixture of multiple FPS games, Tribes/Battlefield
<JunkerKun> Phase4: Me

<CriticKitten> Hrm, okay. So then it boils down to which one....*ponders*
<Kammerjunk> I don't play anything but Pyro and Engi.
<Phase4> why is the iis version of php twice as large as the generic from php
<Kammerjunk> Combat Engi is -very- fun.
<JunkerKun> Barbetos: Files fighting to get enemy folder?
<therainbowvortex> JunkerKun: spit me out or illd the rainbow vortex boom in your mouth
<Barbetos> Just satnd around a corner shooting the flames out untill you need more ammo. People will walk into death.
*JunkerKun spits therainbowvortex in fear
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Kammerjunk> INB4 Gold_Demona murders everyone.
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Hey!
<therainbowvortex> god now give me a hug that will steal your soul
<CriticKitten> Drat, it's so tough to choose. XD
<therainbowvortex> i meen good
<CriticKitten> Dice roll time!
<Lil_B> hey JunkerKun ! :)
*JunkerKun hugs therainbowvortex
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Which ones do you have?
<JunkerKun> Wait. What?
<JunkerKun> I don't have a soul O_o
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Lil_B
*therainbowvortex hugs JunkerKun back and steals his soul
<Lil_B> hai thar AdamTheDuck :)
<Barbetos> I have never seen a red team win one of deez.
<Barbetos> they doing it wrong!
<Kammerjunk> It's theoretically possible.
<CriticKitten> Kammerjunk: Twilightlicious, one with Doctor Hooves, Elements of Harmony, and....*checks again* Radicalness.
<therainbowvortex> JunkerKun: eww your soul is yuccky you can have it back
<JunkerKun> therainbowvortex: But... as I said, I don't have soul...
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Tough choice, man. I'd go with Twilightlicious, but I -am- a but of a Twiley fanatic.
<CriticKitten> Filly Cooly and Dr Adorable are both dirty so no go there. :P
<Kammerjunk> So that may possibly affect my choice.
<Barbetos> I would not wear taht shirt. Course I am paranoid that people would assume in the worst way possible, and it would come back to me some how.
<Codex> Zzzttt
<therainbowvortex> JunkerKun: oh this is your drool all over me then
<Lil_B> ... it appears Microsoft Explorer isn't responding :/
<Kammerjunk> Yes! Kill that Gold_Demona!
<Barbetos> it appears I have burst into flame.
<Kammerjunk> I mean.
*JunkerKun bits therainbowvortex
<Codex> ZZzzt
<CriticKitten> Barbetos: Honestly if this school has to dip so low as to fire me for wearing a pony tee to a work day, I'm happy not to work there any more. :P
<Barbetos> Codex do you need something?
<Codex> zzzzttt
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Oh, you work there?
<Codex> what?
<Jmo> Haha
<Codex> no i dont need anything

<CriticKitten> 'tis a work day so we're allowed to wear civis.
<therainbowvortex> JunkerKun: plz dont eat me im a ancent pony spiret from hell
<Kammerjunk> Wait, you have work attire?
<Barbetos> CriticKitten people have some over active imaginations, all I am saying.
<Kammerjunk> My teachers just kinda wear clothes.
<Codex> ZZZzzZZZzzt
<Barbetos> Tend to asssume the worst.
<Codex> Not Functioning
<CriticKitten> I do. Our school has a dress code, mostly in a vain attempt to cull gang activity.
<Codex> Dissconect-
<Barbetos> Thank god.
<therainbowvortex> JunkerKun: okay im not from hell but im still an aceint pony gosht
<Kammerjunk> Ah, makes sense.
<JunkerKun> therainbowvortex: eew... you must be dusty...

<Kammerjunk> Well, I wouldn't know, really. Don't think there's a lot of that around here.
<Jmo> AHAHAHA

<therainbowvortex> JunkerKun: i am
<CriticKitten> Pony gang? I'd be fine with that.
<Phase4> last map for me
<Barbetos> And they go on a crazy adventure together solving mysterys! Completely original story idea.
<CriticKitten> For their initiation, they'd brand cutie marks onto themselves.
<JunkerKun> therainbowvortex: Ew

<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight everyone :)

<Barbetos|AtWork> You play LA Noire before?
<Gold_Demona> Nope
<Barbetos|AtWork> I could imagine Cole Phelps hounding some one about best pony
<Barbetos|AtWork> That is what that is from.
<Gold_Demona> I see
<Jmo> Still yet to get that game ;~;
<Barbetos|AtWork> I have two copies of it sadly enough.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Not sure how I got the PC copy
<Barbetos|AtWork> Probably bought it, can't remember.
<Jmo> Lawl
<Barbetos|AtWork> I got the PS3 version for free.
<Jmo> Sho?
<Jmo> o.O
<Jmo> oic.

<GriffonCherry> Webclient IS down.
<Wrek> 05i see
<Stormy`> lol
<Stormy`> not very patient is he?
<GriffonCherry> Syllly came back. :3
<Sylandest> there we go
<GriffonCherry> Wrek: Why isn't the webclient working?
<Wrek> 05dunno
<Sylandest> maybe it experienced an error?
<Barbetos|AtWork> You can not even get to the pony chat website
<Barbetos|AtWork> I had to install IRC, and use a cached version of the site to find the info
<GriffonCherry> Why is that?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Not sure.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I have not bothered to check to see if it is a domain issue or something
<Barbetos|AtWork> More than likely the server that hosts it is just down.
<GriffonCherry> It's saying error 101 for me.
<Sylandest> either way, at least this still works
<Saturn> 08,01i love beethoven's 9th

<Barbetos|AtWork> Okay its gone
<Jmo> Willy Wonka.
<BladedWings> lol Barbetos|AtWork

<Lil_B> understandable, it's really cold in here atm, slows down typing n' Stuff
<Jmo> PIE FOR ALL
<Lil_B> OMGosh! What Flavour!
<Jmo> Not pie flavour.

<Jmo> Potato flavour.
<Lil_B> I think I would actually get a recipe for Potato Cake if I ask my Grandma :/
<Lil_B> ok, I already like VLC as my new Music Player, but it needs some more detailed configuration >.<
<Barbetos|AtWork> That is a lot of tanks

<Gold_Demona> I have returned.
<Barbetos|AtWork> You have been placed in a sho.
<Jmo> Welcome back
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> The time out sho.
<Gold_Demona> lol, It was supposed to be "InTheShower" but that was too long. XD
<Barbetos|AtWork> It is similar to a hockey penalty box.
<Barbetos|AtWork> For the purpose of bronystate time out.
<Gold_Demona> dedededed
<Cranberry_Scotch> Hello
<Cades> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/9/hDXY4_eePUWBy1jEbnQ-JA2.jpg How I feel as the first sick person at school
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hey
<Cades> gtg cya
<Barbetos|AtWork> Did you connect with the web client Cranberry_Scotch ?
<Cranberry_Scotch> web client?
<Barbetos|AtWork> The chat box next to the stream
<Cranberry_Scotch> Yes
<Barbetos|AtWork> Huh. Still can't connect to it on my end.
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> I like how Wrek just does not care. He passed like two TR guys.
<Kimori> cya
<Kandarihu> It looks like this isn't even on the front lines. Most of the TR guys would be on the borders of enemy territory.
<Gold_Demona> they so silly
<Kandarihu> Well, sneaking in like this and snatching a lightly defended outpost seems to be a pretty interesting tactic.
<Kandarihu> As far as the TR defending the territory, they're just doing what seems to be the obvious thing to do.
<Gold_Demona> lol snakes
<Kandarihu> Er, defending their borders
<alexxm> hey guys for some reason my internet was acting up
<Gold_Demona> Mmm carrots
*alexxm gives Gold_Demona the gift of fire

<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: I'm fine, bro.....we're hours away from the second delivery of an event i like to call NOSTALGIAWEEN
<alexxm> sup ryaxnb
<ryaxnb> not much
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: yes, wait, you did
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: you also had chat issues?
<Dark92Enigma> hi MadSurge!

<MadSurge> ^
<Dark_Horst> why not?
<alexxm> yeah Dark92Enigma the site wouldn't load the chat so i downloaded a client
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: not unless for special appereances, as he personally mentioned
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: he decided to not do it anymore
<alexxm> yeah but still Dark92Enigma isn't this too soon i heard he wanted to try making some other show
<Dark92Enigma> Dark_Horst: because he's now working on new projects he wanted to do for a long time: DEMO REEL
<Dark_Horst> demo reel?
<Dark92Enigma> still, he said the NC is not 100% dead
<alexxm> yes but still it's only been what a month
<Dark92Enigma> Dark_Horst: It's a show where Doug along with other hosts, reviews both old and new movies
<Dark_Horst> that could get interesting
<alexxm> so it'll have more crossovers?
*sonicandmario85 sneaks into the chat and steals all the muffins
<alexxm> how are things sonicandmario85 Revolution08 and shana
*sonicandmario85 eats muffins
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: yes there will be, hopefully
<Dark92Enigma> the point is, while NC isn't dead, it won't be a weekly show anymore, and DEMO REEL will replace it
<Dark92Enigma> AND now......why did i mention NOSTALGIAWEEN?
<Flyboy> oh and is sam shepherd here?
*sonicandmario85 Dark92Enigma notices i stole all the muffins and ate them
<alexxm> sup zjdtmkhzt
<Dark92Enigma> Because since we're in OCTOBER, and we're mostly watching NOSTALGIC movies here on Bronystate, i wanted to name this month as such
<Flyboy> i guess thats a no then
<zjdtmkhzt> um, hello, alexxm^^
<Dark92Enigma> Flyboy: we'll have to see.....
<Dark92Enigma> anyway, AJIsAwesome approved of the idea, of calling OCTOBER as NOSTALGIAWEEN to honor him, even if there's little to no chance to see a HALLOWEEN movie
<Flyboy> Dark92Enigma: yeah he's my freind. he used to hate mlp but when he watched one he said it wasnt that bad. he isnt a proper brony though. i told him to take a look at this website as it isnt completely pony streams
<Moopy> Sup everypony and yo whats up wrek

<diddutz> alexxm: fine for me, thanks ^^
<Dark92Enigma> Flyboy: he visited the site, when?
<Flyboy> Dark92Enigma: he's in sixth form. i met him about 3-4 years ago and we havent talked much so.

<ekips> or biologist?
<Lil_B> ekips Chemisch Technischer Assistent :)
<Alchemist> Lil_B: okay, then I know roughly what it is. We have a different term for that in hungarian.
<ekips> Lil_B may Celestia have mercy on your sould Lil_B
<Lil_B> Alchemist but the "Colocium" Part is, when we draw a part of the Bakteria, and let our Teacher have a look at it, and than we have to describe to him why we think that this the Bacteria we think it is
<Alchemist> Lil_B: it actually sounds fun imo.
<Lil_B> ekips why, the Brony Research and Development Team need more members xD
<Gold_Demona> Well, I think Imma head out for the day.

<Rustymeat> It does doesnt it?
<AJIsAwesome> Brb. :)
<Cades> thanks
<Blako> kinda quiet here
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Hot topic has sinned.
<Cades> yeah :/
<Cades> What did they do? :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> On their website, if you specify your age as 18 or older, they make it impossible to uncheck the "newsletters and promos by email" box
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> that is just evil.
<Cades> wow
<killerpony7733> Woo silence?
<DashWithRainbows> Ssshh.
<killerpony7733> Nu
<DashWithRainbows> Embrace the silence.
<killerpony7733> :>
<DashWithRainbows> Yush.
<Rustymeat> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ideally I wouldnt buy from them because they are where things go to die but the have an awesome rainbow dash figure i must purchase
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but they want $35 to ship it which is totally crazy
<Blako> on what website?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/MyLittlePony//My+Little+Pony+Rainbow+Dash+Vinyl+Figure-144781.jsp
<Sylandest> meep?
<AJIsAwesome> Meep.
<Techmarine> one word....
<Sylandest> meeep
<Rustymeat> boop
<AJIsAwesome> Meep meep.
<Cades> oh
<Brad[Laptop]> is anyone here from the USA planning on ordering the vinyl rainbow dash figure from hottopic anytime soon? I want to buy one but they want $35 to ship it to canada which is nuts.
<Blako> pony in the middle and walking death on the backgroud :D
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<Blako> quite big contrast
<Brad[Laptop]> so i figured if someone else is ordering one I could pay a more sane amount to reship it to me lol
<Panda> AJIsShort, did you sleep well?
<alexxm> hey guys
<Stormy`> o.o
<Stormy`> that figure is at hot topic?
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: Yes. :)
<pony_7017> what game is this?
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not short. :(
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, alexxm. :)
<AJIsAwesome> It's Planetside 2.
<alexxm> how are things AJIsAwesoem
<AJIsAwesome> Pretty good. How about you? :)
<Stormy`> kinda more than I'd want to spend on pony stuff but it's pretty cool
<alexxm> i'm good
<Moopy> Hey JDM Works90 you here man?
<alexxm> and i have a chat client now incase the chats acting up again
<Cades> Yesterday I saw Portal coasters at the mall haha
<Stormy`> I still haven't played through portal
<Stormy`> It made me angry because I couldn't get the controls
<Cades> haha
<Stormy`> I think I remember throwing the controller at a wall...
<Cades> lol
<Stormy`> Some of the stuff you have to do in that game is not designed to be done in first person with a 360 controller
<Cades> It seemed fine for me
<Stormy`> I generally suck at first person anyway too
<alexxm> but yeah my HDMI cables broken and i'm borrowing someones
<Stormy`> so that was probably it
<alexxm> is the chat ded
*AJIsAwesome whistles suspiciously and tosses a pie into chat
<Blako> I have never played portal, so I can't say anything aobout it, but it looks quite difficult
<twilight_sprinkle> is there a stream
<alexxm> yep twilight_sprinkle
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<twilight_sprinkle> ok
<twilight_sprinkle> th
<twilight_sprinkle> x
<Cades> It's easier once you kinda figure it out
<donutpop3651> Who's on?
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek.
<donutpop3651> Ok!
<Cades> Co-op was pretty hard though haha
<Stormy`> Portal is probably one of those things everyone loves that I'll never get
<Stormy`> like Zelda
<ASoftFluffyThing> PIE!
<Cades> I've never played zelda either haha
<Stormy`> oh good, I'm not alone haha
<BladedWings> PINKIE!
<Stormy`> every time I tell someone that they're like "OMG you're totally missing out go play them nao"
<Rustymeat> WINKIE!
<Cades> There's so many games I haven't played
<BladedWings> Inkie
<Stormy`> which makes me want to play them even less...
<Cades> exactly
<Pink3> Wow wrek has been playing this for at least 3 hours
<AJIsAwesome> As Mama Luigi would say, he's been playing FOR HOURS!
<donutpop3651> D'aww, Twilight's watching!
<Stormy`> 27 minutes until class...
<Stormy`> I should probably be working on finishing my homework that's due
<Stormy`> XD
<Cades> yeah haha
<Stormy`> the professor teaching it has no clue what he's talking about though and is really lenient with everything
<Stormy`> So I'm not too worried
<Cades> ah
<Stormy`> He's a math teacher
<Stormy`> forced to teach a database class
<Rustymeat> mama luigi never said that
<Cades> wow haha
<Stormy`> IMO they probably should've just not offered the course since they were so short staffed
<Stormy`> but whatever
<Rustymeat> I want a plushie :(
<AJIsAwesome> Rustymeat: I'm talking about the "FOR HOURS" bit.
<Stormy`> easy A for me since I know more about SQL than he does :P
<Cades> hahaha
<Rustymeat> I havnt watched youtube poop in a while
<Blako> XD
<AJIsAwesome> It didn'y come from YTP.
<twilight_sprinkle> i watched a bunch of them yesterday
<AJIsAwesome> It came from the cartoon.
<Rustymeat> yeah I know you know what I mean
<twilight_sprinkle> so many ytps, so little time...
<cachi01> gay luigi?
<BladedWings> no
<Rustymeat> Ive never watched the cartoon proper
<AJIsAwesome> LOTSA SPAGJHETTI!
<cachi01> ALL TOASTERS TOAST TOAST!
<BladedWings> Mama Luigi
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I don't do any fancy sql with like JOIN and suff.
<AJIsAwesome> That's Mama Luigi to you, Mario!
<cachi01> mama?
<cachi01> LUIGI?
<cachi01> AHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHA
<AJIsAwesome> Coney Island DIsco Palace!
<cachi01> all dem quotes
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy` if you ever go by a hot topic that has that figure buy it for me plz ill send you paypals :) I just dont want to pay $35 to ship it which is nuts because I know usps will charge like $7 to ship it max.
<cachi01> dis song
<Stormy`> haha sure
<Stormy`> I'll pick one up next time I go to the mall
<cachi01> BANG BANG

<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: There's a mismatched fight if there ever was one.
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: http://cdn.derpiboo.ru/thumbs/1200/700/4f1d43ea945b705c99000001

<BroPony|MEDIC> https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=9467
<Dken2021> itseems like your page doesn't work BroPony|MEDIC
<BroPony|MEDIC> Hmmm
<BladedWings> Bronysith: your pics never seem to show dude
<MadSurge> BroPony|MEDIC: if it's spoilers, DESIST NOW.
<BroPony|MEDIC> thats the only link to the video i have, and it MUST BE WATCHED
<Bronysith> j
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350053789663.jpg
<BroPony|MEDIC> You really cant call it a spoiler in any way
<BladedWings> Bronysith: well that worked :D
<BroPony|MEDIC> besides if you think it is, you dont have to watch it
<Dark92Enigma> BroPony|MEDIC: what video?
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: :D
<BroPony|MEDIC> the one in the link i put on, its a S3 preview
<BroPony|MEDIC> its on EQD
<Dken2021> oh, you mean THAT video? BroPony|MEDIC, I would advise you try not to post that
<Bronysith> BroPony|MEDIC: thats a spoiler
<BroPony|MEDIC> Bronysith: How?
<Dark92Enigma> hold on.......THAT'S A SPOILER
<Bronysith> BroPony|MEDIC: have fun getting banned for 24 hours
<MadSurge> BroPony|MEDIC: Everything about S3 is a spoiler.
<BroPony|MEDIC> No ones forcing you to watch it, and that honestly makes no sense
<BroPony|MEDIC> but whatever
<Dken2021> well, it's been kinda the rule here
<Bronysith> for like
<Bronysith> ever
<BroPony|MEDIC> i know that
<Bronysith> you know that
<Bronysith> and you did it anyway
<BroPony|MEDIC> but regardless
<alexxm> yeah i thought anything about season 3 got a banning
<MadSurge> That's the rules. Don't break them.
<Stallion_of_War> FOREVVVVVVEEEEEEEERRRRRR
<Dken2021> jsut makin sure you don't get in trouble for a mistake
<BroPony|MEDIC> i didnt think of it as a spoiler
<Bronysith> it still is
<Dark92Enigma> Rule #2334 CONCERNING Season 3: Don't post S3 previews, regardless if somepony wants to see it or not, because that's due for an autoban
<BroPony|MEDIC> will thats BS in my book
<AJIsAwesome> Not a perma ban. Maybe a time ban, but not permaban.
<Bronysith> well this isnt your book BroPony|MEDIC
<BroPony|MEDIC> Bronysith: I know that, your not listening
<Dken2021> don't take it with us, take it with the mods, they're the ones that enforeced it
<Bronysith> BroPony|MEDIC: *you're
<DashWithRainbows> Bronysith Isn't*

<alexxm> i send babies to fight chimps because it amuses me
<MaxTheBrony> Good evening :)
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Also, honestly, even though it's obviously correct and stated in the MotD, resorting to correcting spelling or grammar is just weak.

<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: meanwhile isnt here, i have to fill the gap
<Dken2021> Stallion_of_War did you check your spam mail? cause it's likely to be in there this time

<pot80> Dken2021 well theres a movie b movie then two mlp vids?
<Stormy`> Oh yeah, there was this one time where all the opers got pingspammed by a botnet...

<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy RAWRity!
<RAWRity> So, getting my team ready to storm the Elite Four and kick the Champion's ass
<Stormy`> I actually don't remember much, but I think the problem was that they insisted on doing everything their way
*Bronysith glomps RAWRity
<Ghost_Nappa> kool
<RAWRity> Bronysith: kinda slow n that one
<alexxm> d'aww
<Stormy`> They wanted to change the network name to theirs, follow all their network rules, stuff like that

<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy LunasGuard!
<RAWRity> Ghost_Nappa: White 2
<Panda> night night Wrek
<Stormy`> And their admin was lecturing us afterwards about it
<Silver_Spoon> night Wrek
<Amu-chan> Kind of sounds immature to me.

<Bronysith> i feel like playing something with giant mechs
<Kimori> That is so awesome
<Shizuka> 13this intro, everyone's so serious, except batou
<Ghost_Nappa> gtg
<Shizuka> 13he's wandering around smirking
<Bronysith> Sumica: whos the main character?
<Bronysith> name
<Ghost_Nappa> il beback later
<Kimori> They did the pingspam? just to be anooying?
<Ghost_Nappa> in like 1 hour
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: Like a Batou...
<Ghost_Nappa> bai
<Sumica> 00,10is it laging?
<Stormy`> Well, that was our theory at the time
<Dark_Horst> nope
<Stormy`> There's no real proof
<Shizuka> 13was during derpy but good now
<Everlasting_Joy> No
<LunasGuard> nope
<Stormy`> just a lot of coincidence that pointed that way
<Sumica> 00,10all the cops
<Shizuka> 13previously on police academy
<Dark_Horst> that
<Lil_B> I hate it when the Animation in Animes is so good that it looks almost like they used 3D Models >.<
<Dark_Horst> that's what my driveway look like during semester break
<Shizuka> 13Lil_B: they often do, the tachikomas are 3d
<Silver_Spoon> 3D is actually used as a cost-cutter
<Sumica> 00,10I like this ep
<Lil_B> Shizuka and the cars we just saw?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: and then you have the Berserk movie, which is like half 3D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Its not hard to defeat spam.
<Shizuka> 13oooo the saito one <3
<Dark_Horst> all cgi hate aside,t here's movement in animation that just look worlds betetr when done in 3d
<Pink3> Yay
<Fl00t4hSh41> Lil_B: 3D graphics where only used for the robots and vehicles in this show afaik
<Sumica> 00,10Saito is awsome
<Stormy`> spambots still pop up all the time on spyroforum :(
<Shizuka> 13can't read his, can't read his
<Sumica> 00,10at least they cellshade the 3d cg bits
<Stormy`> crap, battery's dying, brb
<Silver_Spoon> Imperial America? wat
<Sumica> 00,10there was a cival war in the US
<Kimori> k
<Sumica> 00,10it split in to 3 bits
<Silver_Spoon> ah
<Shizuka> 13Silver_Spoon: it's 2030, we've have two more world wars, nuclear world war 3 and non-nuclear 4
<Bronysith> i got to get into GITS more
<Dark_Horst> the've been busy during those 30 years
<red_ony> seriously you two
<Silver_Spoon> and now I know...The More You Know...(tm)
<alexxm> why are the tanks so cute
<Shizuka> 13the american empire is what's left of the current US government, the rest was bought up by russia and mexico i think
<Dark_Horst> lol
<Bronysith> american empire
<RAWRity> Shizuka: damn Reds and their nuclear money
<Sumica> 00,10Silver_Spoon use alt +0153 for ™
<Bronysith> of course japan comes up with that
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: anything important happened in europe?
<Sumica> 00,10"what do you know about -thegame-
<Shizuka> 13we later learn berlin was hit in both wars
<Silver_Spoon> lemme try this again...The More You Know™
<AppleDashFan982838> hi
<Shizuka> 13otherwise they don't go into it terribly much that i recall
<AppleDashFan982838> Ghost in a shell is a good anime
<cuddly_kittehs> Good day!
<cuddly_kittehs> :3
<Sumica> 00,10hello
<Bronysith> most animes are good in their own respective way
<Lil_B> Shizuka because Berlin has to be involved in every Word War somehow :)
<red_ony> I only know the movies..I don't think the series would be for me
<cuddly_kittehs> Heya Sumica :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yeah I could implant more stuff but im a bit lazy
<Dark_Horst> there just cant be a worldwar without us at least saying hi at the party, it seems
<AppleDashFan982838> I seen a few ghost in a shell movies
<MaxTheBrony> What is this?
<MaxTheBrony> Gundam?
<Dark_Horst> ghost in the shell
<MaxTheBrony> Oh
<RAWRity> Bronysith: eh, I have to disagree with the "most" part.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: well yea
<Dark_Horst> yay, war-stories
<AppleDashFan982838> it's awesome
<RAWRity> Bronysith: there's a huge glut of anime that's terrible, pandering garbage riding trends of what's popular.
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst can't be a World War without everyone joining :P
<Bronysith> RAWRity: then there are the DBZ rip offs
<AppleDashFan982838> ah yeah
<AppleDashFan982838> dbz was good not anymorte
<GriffonCherry> Colours off and join!
<Bronysith> RAWRity: what did you think of NGE?
<AppleDashFan982838> more
<pot80> RAWRity: Yes but if you look then there is an abundence of great anime
<RAWRity> Moe and Fanservice shows in anime are akin to Police procedurals and hospital dramas over here.
<AppleDashFan982838> ah yeah
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350070511444.jpg the face on this Douche bag is priceless
<RAWRity> pot80: there's lots of good anime, yes, but the majority of the medium, like in a lot of media, is generic splooge sent out in order to cash in on a trend
<Dark_Horst> how did they get in there?
<Fl00t4hSh41> There too much blatant fanservice and moe in Anime nowdays for my days
<Fl00t4hSh41> I miss the days of Legends of the Galactic Heroes
<Dark92Enigma> AppleDashFan982838: what do you mean ''not anymore''?
<red_ony> with most anime I don't feel like I am the target audience (with I´might be true); they seem to silly and over the top ... I only have a handful of anime I like and bought
<Sumica> 00,10ass shot
<pot80> RAWRity yeah but you get that in every culture, group, fandom, buisiness or whatever
<Kandarihu> I love moe. I hate overt fanservice.
<Dark_Horst> that has to hurt
<Shizuka> 13major immediately knows what's up
<AppleDashFan982838> To me only one saga or two sagas where good
<LunasGuard> he's bait
<RAWRity> Bronysith: I feel that NGE is a show that's better in theory than execution. I like the idea of taking a typically brainless genre and putting a darker, more psychological and cerebral twist, but the execution in the original NGE series was poorly handled and ultimately not as standout and perfect as some people claim it is.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Shizuka: Of course, she's japanese
<Silver_Spoon> click=kilometer. didn't know that until today
<Sumica> 00,10Rebuild is good NGE is mindfuck
<Fl00t4hSh41> Shizuka: Only the japanese characters are competent in this show
<DJPON3> wat we watchin?
<Ryunosuke> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leobr7Z7mO1qchw13o1_500.jpg -- "Relevant - Tara Strong"
<Kandarihu> I don't mind fanservice when it's in moderation. But it's rare to see it in moderation nowadays.
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Everlasting_Joy> Silver_Spoon: It's spelled klick.
<red_ony> I never got through NGE , tried too times...don't get what the fuss is about
<Bronysith> RAWRity: i liked it, but friggin creepy
<red_ony> +two
<Silver_Spoon> Everlasting_Joy: that makes more sense :x
<DJPON3> What are we watching guys?
<RAWRity> pot80: thus why I simply said I disagree with the "most" part of the previous statement. There's lots of great anime, but that's only a small portion of it that's really "Great"
<Bronysith> RAWRity: now what u think of say Gurren Lagann
<LunasGuard> dat neck shot
<Kandarihu> I would've watched through NGE to the end if I hadn't been forced to downgrade my cable right before the end.
<AppleDashFan982838> you can always rent it
<Dark_Horst> sneaky
<DJPON3> Guys?
<Bronysith> i need to watch Rebuild
<Kandarihu> AppleDashFan982838, yeah, true. There are other options.
<pot80> RAWRity oh sorry :P I get mixed up with words an stuff
<red_ony> you can still rent dvd? this is 2012^^
<Dark_Horst> DJMidgetBrony: ghost in the shell
<DJPON3> What are we watching?
<Sumica> 00,10DJPON3, Ghost in the shell
<AppleDashFan982838> yes DVDs still exist
<Dark_Horst> i jsut said it
<DJPON3> Ah. thx
<RAWRity> Bronysith: a fun love letter/homage to the Giant Robot genre. While not particularly world altering or thought provoking, it's great to watch from a technical aspect, and enjoybale as a narrative, even if it's not deep.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: so you enjoyed it?
<RAWRity> Basically: NGE= great idea, flubbed execution. TTGL=simple idea, superb execution
<RAWRity> Bronysith: yes.
<red_ony> whom are you talking tp sniper?
<red_ony> :D
<Kandarihu> red_ony, himself
<Dark_Horst> us, silly
<Bronysith> RAWRity: yay. And how about classic Dragon ball? not Dragon ball z
<red_ony> Kandarihu: That's silly
<Lil_B> hi red_ony :)
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: it was great....
<Kandarihu> red_ony, it's a good way to crystalize his thoughts.
<red_ony> Lil_B: Hi there :)
<MadSurge> Shizuka! I like Torchlight 2, and it's not lagging as badly as I feared :D
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350058063426.jpg
<Bronysith> damn leech
<Kandarihu> Queen Kong
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350056082504.png
<Dark92Enigma> and it got me into the anime even more Bronysith
<Shizuka> 13queen kong, aka MOTOKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Sumica> 00,10yes she cut his hand off
<RAWRity> Bronysith: a fun enough action/comedy series that benefits from Nostalgia goggles, but doesn't hold up well to watching it as an adult. Lots of imature humor that doesn't appeal to anyone past the age of 13, some decent action scenes, but ultimately not anywhere near as good as "90's Kids" would have you believe.
<AJTheMightyGamer> oh, man... just watched the colbert report... funny stuff... what i miss?
<Bronysith> RAWRity: i agree, still better than DBZ in my opinion
<RAWRity> Bronysith: true. better pacing than DBZ. Z suffered from the fact that Toriyama clearly didn't want to continue the series, but was forced into it by his editors.
<Bronysith> friggin editors
<AJTheMightyGamer> well, im gonna go now. bye everyone
<RAWRity> something that both the manga and comic book industry need to figure out: Good stories END.
<Kandarihu> AJTheMightyGamer, later
<MadSurge> Bronysith: I liked DBZ until the Frieza saga ended
<Lil_B> byye AJTheMightyGamer
<Bronysith> what is Wrek doing there sniping people?
<RAWRity> Yes, it may take years to tell a story, but it has to END eventually.
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: I was thinking the same thing :).
<Fl00t4hSh41> MadSurge: Did they ever get off namek
<Fl00t4hSh41> *?
<Kandarihu> I enjoyed DBZ throughout except for the Goku vs Frieza battle.
<AppleDashFan982838> huh
<AppleDashFan982838> I liked the Cell Saga
<MadSurge> Fl00t4hSh41: Yeah! Incredible, isn't it? :D
<Sumica> 00,10love this bit
<Lil_B> I kinda liked DBZ but I like the first Dragonballs more where Goku is a Kid
<Sumica> 00,10also this version of the song
<AppleDashFan982838> I kinda did as well
<Silver_Spoon> DBZ was supposed to end 4 times before it actually did. thank god we didn't get something terrible after that.
<MadSurge> Lil_B: yeah, but it might not hold on to nostalgia goggles :D
<RAWRity> Look at "The Sandman" by Neil Gaiman. It went on for 10 years, and ended exactly where it needed to. And it's considered one of the best pieces of western picture, regardless of medium. Now look at most mainstream Super Hero comics. Not much to talk about positive on either Marvel or DC.
<MadSurge> Silver_Spoon: thank god Dragonball GT is not canon
<Fl00t4hSh41> RAWRity: Did you ever read Lucifer?
<Everlasting_Joy> There's some skipping.
<red_ony> this dialog needs more words
<pot80> yes like wanted 2008
<Silver_Spoon> MadSurge: GT? What's that? >_>
<MadSurge> Silver_Spoon: Ikr
<RAWRity> Fl00t4hSh41: afraid I haven't
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah , it isa kinda derpy, and gokus enthusiasm is just too over the Top :/
<Fl00t4hSh41> RAWRity: I think that's what it was called. It was about what Lucifer did after he closed hell and retired in Sandman
<MadSurge> Lil_B: thankfully it's all Toei Animation's fault and Toriyama refused to do anything in it :S
<RAWRity> Fl00t4hSh41: it rings a bell. I'm sure a friend of mine's told me to check it out at some point.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02o3o

*Bronysith glomps NewSuperBronyU
<Lil_B> MadSurge I'm not that good with Anime :/

<Everlasting_Joy> That was awesome.
<DashWithRainbows> I can make you fall asleep.

<AppleDashFan982838> Hi Dash
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, well the tank from that episode wasn't running amok. It was being piloted by a brain that was implanted as if it were a cyberbrain.
<Shizuka> 13yeaaaaaah but the tank itself was still running amok :3
<Fl00t4hSh41> Shizuka: No, it's driver was directing it. The tank couldn't do anyhting on its own
<Fl00t4hSh41> Shizuka: The combat chopper that goes berserk after its pilot has a stroke is a better example
<weegee2062> whats dis
<Sumica> 00,10Ghost in the shell
<thelonepony> ^
<weegee2062> oh
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Bronysith with a cyborg feather duster (delayed reaction)
<Dark_Horst> well, is seems limeV jsut doesnt want to make the hop into my general area
<Dark_Horst> fuck
<Sumica> 00,10the Dr looks like batou
<Sumica> 00,10contact your ISP
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like it's being blocked
<Dark_Horst> why now though? worked for the previous EP
<Barbetos|AtWork> Michael Bross is an awesome composer.
<Sumica> 00,10last ep was mips not lime V
<Fl00t4hSh41> DaringDerpy: could it be a software firewall on your end?
<pony_7017> yay more ghost in the shell :)
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: right. forgot that for a second. though, usually limev runs a lot smoother for me than mips
<Fl00t4hSh41> GASP!
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<thelonepony> D:
<Ryunosuke> what
<Shizuka> 13ZOMBIE TANKS
<Fl00t4hSh41> They are all zombie robots!
<weegee2062> wut
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Inclement weather conditions? Is there a Godzilla storm out there?
<weegee2062> yes
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: Mothra
<Sumica> 00,10a state alcimist
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, it's an obligatory storm.
<weegee2062> ?
<thelonepony> :D
<Shizuka> 13major used guilt trip
<weegee2062> kill him
<Sumica> 00,10the storm was fabricated to delay the flight
<Shizuka> 13it's super effective
<weegee2062> yes luke i am
<RAWRity> so, best gif of the VP Debate last night: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbrbcnxpa81rg2rf7o1_500.gif
<Barbetos|AtWork> VP debates are pointless.
<RAWRity> not really
<Barbetos|AtWork> No. Really.
<Kandarihu> Biden was was a jerk last night
<RAWRity> when you're voting, you're voting for the VP as well.
<Ryunosuke> scientists are at a lost
<Fl00t4hSh41> Shouldn't the signal time between satelite and body create lag issues for the tachikomas?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Unless you count that gif as something not pointless then, yes I suppose they have some use for the internet.
<RAWRity> meaning that if shit goes down, you'd trust that person to run the country
<Shizuka> 13SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<weegee2062> SPPPPAAAAACE
<Ryunosuke> scace
<pony_7017> spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
*sonicdude558 yawns at the Portal 2 Reference
<Ryunosuke> I want to go to space
<Sumica> 00,10you would think that Fl00t4hSh41
<weegee2062> well do you like bannanas
<Kammerjunk> The atomic weight of Germanium is 72.64.
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: being a jerk was kind of his job last night.
<sonicdude558> Yo homies whos streaming
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well considering how rarely things tend to go that way, I still feel that it is a safe assessment.
<Kammerjunk> Polymerase I Polypeptide A is a human gene.
<weegee2062> ?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Sumica: I mean, it would have to be a geostationary orbit to keep the the satelite overhead 24/7, so thats 40.000 kilometers
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, well I wouldn't want a jerk like that running the country.
<RAWRity> Ryan's goal last night was to try and stand toe-to-toe with Biden and show he's good despite the experience gap. Biden's job was to try and make Ryan look inexperienced and not up to snuff.
<sonicdude558> Whos streaming?
<thelonepony> sonicdude558: Sumica
<AppleDashFan982838> such a good episode
<sonicdude558> ok
<AppleDashFan982838> I love it
<AppleDashFan982838> a lot
<Sumica> 00,10and later events make that unlikly Fl00t4hSh41
<Shizuka> 13RAWRity: and to get back for obama's disaster at the pres debate
<weegee2062> stop talking about goverment
<alexxm> the soundtrack for this is good
<AppleDashFan982838> yes it is
<thelonepony> ^
<Everlasting_Joy> Yeah, no politics please.
<AppleDashFan982838> I love this sries
<AppleDashFan982838> series
<Sumica> 00,10wake up and show the light
<weegee2062> ?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: I like to imagine that before he went out on stage, Biden looked back over his shoulder and said to Obama "That's my secret, Mr. President. I'm always angry."
<AppleDashFan982838> I love ther storyline in this anime
<Fl00t4hSh41> Sumica: Could be low earth orbit and they just relay the signal. That's what is implied, but that should also create a lot of lag
<pony_7017> anyone here watch toonami?
<AppleDashFan982838> yes
<sonicdude558> boo 4kids
<AppleDashFan982838> sometimes
<Shizuka> 13it's a big effin deal :3
<AppleDashFan982838> 4kids is gone for good
<thelonepony> ^
<AppleDashFan982838> thank god
<RAWRity> Also, Ryan royally fucked up on the pro-live vs pro-choice debate
<AppleDashFan982838> yeah
<thelonepony> Tachkoma Time :3
<Shizuka> 13oh good smart bullets
<sonicdude558> :O
<thelonepony> :D
<weegee2062> big fan
<sonicdude558> Sumica, Whoaaa
<Shizuka> 13when bullets become self aware, we're going to have a problem
<Sumica> 00,10wrong ping sonicdude558
*weegee2062 dances
<thelonepony> Tachkomas, one of my favourite Robots :3
<Kandarihu> If only Togusa could be best sniper
<AppleDashFan982838> WEIRD AL RULES
<sonicdude558> hey Sumica where do I ping >=-)
<weegee2062> dance with me
<Fl00t4hSh41> Shizuka: That would raise whole new ethical issues about shooting people
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Smart bullets? OH GOD DID WE STEP INTO ULTIMATES 3?!?
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: when you swithed embeds http://i.imgur.com/MvbeN.jpg
<Sumica> 00,10no I meen the woooah is set to a driffrent ping
<Kandarihu> Bullets being self-aware would make little sense after they're fired
<pot80> awesome Spectrum_Rush
<sonicdude558> hmm
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, how did Ryan mess up the pro-Life debate?
<Dark_Horst> make them angry japanese bullets
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Ryan royally fucked up most of the debate. The only reason some spin him as "winning" is because Biden was such an asshat in dismantling him.
<Dark_Horst> problem solved
<Sumica> 00,10just think you could have a whole clip of bullets that are opposed to viloence
<Dark_Horst> or taliban bullets. those would be explosive ammo
<Barbetos|AtWork> Anyone else here in the firefall beta?
<cuddly_kittehs> XD
<CriticKitten> But there's no question who won that debate. :p
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: or a mag of lazy bullets
<Mozdoc> Never heard this song before. Weird Al is amazing.
<Shizuka> 13ehhhh i don't wanna shoot today
<sonicdude558> So... er wheres the ping :3
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: he tried to play both sides of the fence in order to argue his point, and ended up pissing off both sides.
<AppleDashFan982838> AWESOME PMV
<AppleDashFan982838> I love thuis
<AppleDashFan982838> this
<CriticKitten> I would pick up a clip full of procrastinating bullets.
<sonicdude558> or are you scared people will abouse it :)
<CriticKitten> They fire, eventually.
<Dark_Horst> claustrophobic bullets. you wouldnt even get them into the magazine
<CriticKitten> :D
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, I saw him arguing that life begins at conception. He didn't tick me off.
<Blako> have to go now, bye
<Shizuka> 13agoraphobic bullets
<Shizuka> 13they wouldn't want to LEAVE the barrel
*sonicdude558 sighs
<Silver_Spoon> how about bullets that feared stopping?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Nah, the really cool bullets are the Neophobic bullets
<Fl00t4hSh41> They're afraid of anything they don't already know
<sonicdude558> Sumica, wheres the ping :3
<Sumica> 00,10altho they would suffer from the same issue that smart alterry shells suffer from Shizuka
<sonicdude558> You don't want to give it out right?
<Sumica> 00,10the electronics break from the shock of being fired
<Dark_Horst> hipster bullets. "ugh, shredding organs is SO mainstream"
<weegee2062> goldigger
<AppleDashFan982838> yeah
<AppleDashFan982838> good song
<RAWRity> Sumica: that's why they need to have all their electronics made out of nokia phones
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: The problem was that he argued he'd ban abortion except in certain cases, and that we were basically supposed to "trust him" that their platform won't change again. Biden was very clear-cut in his stance: "yes I'm a Catholic, but I don't force my views on others."
<RAWRity> Sumica: they'll never die.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Sumica: That's a general problem with hightech weaponry of any kind.
<pot80> wow exelence
<alexxm> why am i not surprised that raritys a gold digger
<AppleDashFan982838> weird al is a brony
<weegee2062> thats scary
<Sumica> 00,10but then they would not explode
<cuddly_kittehs> THE HORROR!
<Silver_Spoon> 0_________________________0
<Everlasting_Joy> No!
<Fl00t4hSh41> Sumica: The more hightech it is, the more ways it can bteak and the less abuse it can generally take

<thelonepony> hi twilight_sprinkle1 :)

<Sumica> 00,10how did an R2 file get in with r1
<cuddly_kittehs> XD
<twilight_sprinkle1> hai CCCP :)
<Sumica> 00,10lolwoops
<AppleDashFan982838> what anime is this
<Fl00t4hSh41> Britania is in the US now?
<Silver_Spoon> buritania
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: which really sort of exemplifies Romney's major difficulties as a candidate. He keeps trying to adjust his policies, and ends up alienating large swathes of his base. Unless he can get a solid voter base underneath him in the next 3 weeks, I don't see him standing a chance in the swing states.
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: So he says, and yet it's well known they won't appoint a Supreme Court Justice that thinks that way, as Biden pointed out.
<twilight_sprinkle1> Fl00t4hSh41: it took over a part of it, another part is the empire of america iirc
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: In fairness, he's polling well for now.
<Bronysith> badass opening <3
<Michael> howdy everypony!
<AJIsAwesome> I get back to see Code Geass? Nice!
<cuddly_kittehs> Brutania.
<cuddly_kittehs> .....
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Michael! :)
<AppleDashFan982838> is this code gease
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: The question becomes whether or not it's going to hold.
<Sumica> 00,10and then the video bitrate of this opening killed my conection
<twilight_sprinkle1> hoi Michael
<AJIsAwesome> AppleDashFan982838: Yep.
<AppleDashFan982838> f
<Kandarihu> And how did Biden come to that conclusion?
<weegee2062> MICHAEL HOW RU
<thelonepony> Hi Michael :)
*Michael hugs AJIsAwesome twilight_sprinkle1 weegee2062 thelonepony
<Kandarihu> You seem to trust him well enough to take everything he says at face value.
<Zawan> 2nd ep?
<twilight_sprinkle1> this opening is too MLG
*AJIsAwesome hugs Michael back :)
<Michael> weegee2062: good, you?
<cuddly_kittehs> Everyone, it's party time!
<thelonepony> hai AJIsAwesome :)
<sonicdude558> Do you not want to give out the ping Sumica?
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I suppose it'll come down to how well Romney handles the Town Hall format.
<CCCP> hi AJIsAwesome
<weegee2062> great my colds gone
<CCCP> hi Michael
*AJIsAwesome hugs thelonepony and CCCP :)
<Sumica> 00,10you have to use the right word to triger the ping
*Michael hugs CCCP
<sonicdude558> lol
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: He probably looked at Romney's advisors (mostly former Bush advocates) and inferred from there, as I did, that Romney is basically the neo-con's newest favorite.
<AJIsAwesome> Sumi
*CCCP hugs Michael back
<Sumica> 00,10Sumica=yay
<weegee2062> 2012 is he year of the brony
<Michael> lol
<CriticKitten> He'll do what his party tells him, that's why they picked him.
<AJIsAwesome> Sumi= WOAH!
<sonicdude558> lemmie try...!
<sonicdude558> Sumi
<AJIsAwesome> DOn't abuse it.
<sonicdude558> I will not
<AJIsAwesome> Ok.
<sonicdude558> it works
<sonicdude558> :)
<CCCP> 2012 is one year after 2011
<CCCP> :o
<AJIsAwesome> So badass. :D
<sonicdude558> Sumi
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hacks
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, it seems that Romney was the left's favorite during the GOP primaries. The real conservatives wanted Santorum.
<weegee2062> da magics
<twilight_sprinkle1> he didnt ask her for the password though
<Kandarihu> I wanted Santorum
<Barbetos|AtWork> She is so fired
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/QK3oC.jpg
<pot80> nice thing to say to a recovering patient :P
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Romney was the favorite for the neo-cons, though, it's why he got the most favorable press by folks like Rush or Hannity. :p
<thelonepony> Best crossover Michael
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: and if Santorum had won, it would have given comedians enough material for the rest of the year.
<Michael> dat pinkie :D
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Dark_Horst> just created a minecraft random world.... spawned underwater. in the middle of a very deep and very very wide ocean

<sonicdude558> Sumi
<pot80> guten tag, emerald
<sonicdude558> whoa is right
<sonicdude558> :)
<Tragar> wut, dat anime? O.o
<LunasGuard> dat swim suit
<Dark_Horst> i'm missin gthe fanservice? gee, thanks limeV
<Kandarihu> Whatever. Romney says things that contradict labels and you accuse him of flip-flopping. I don't even care IF he's flip-flopping, as long as he doesn't flip-flop anywhere near where Obama is. I trust him not to do that.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/iXrRn.jpg
<Dark_Horst> ,,,what are you watching there anyway?
<Sumica> 00,10good thing this highschool student happens to know how to drive a giant mech
<twilight_sprinkle1> dont think ive seen an anime without fanservice
<Sumica> 00,10Code geass, Dark_Horst
<CriticKitten> Well, it can't be THAT hard to drive a multimillion dollar mecha
<Dark_Horst> okay
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle1: Same here. :D
<CriticKitten> Her old knightmare is so adorably crap. <3
<sonicdude558> hmm lemmie test another ping
<twilight_sprinkle1> bleh, that beeping sounded like my alarm clock, blow it up
<sonicdude558> Sumica
<Dark_Horst> CriticKitten: it's not if the developers were smart enough to give it WASD controls
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle1: Serial Experiments Lain
<sonicdude558> goodie
<CriticKitten> ORANGE BOY!
<sonicdude558> Notepad time
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: Cool. What's the synopsis?
<Sumica> 00,10sonicdude558, you are starting to anoy with that
<sonicdude558> ok
<Caramel> Well that was odd. :o Asked for a password after I changed my name to this...
<Kandarihu> Well, most Knightmare Frames qualify as reals. Reals are always going to be less expensive than the supers that aren't outright priceless.
<twilight_sprinkle1> RAWRity: ok,never heard of it though
*CriticKitten forgot his actual name. Only knows him as "Orange Boy" or "Orange-Kun".
<Sumica> 00,10names reserver pony34947
<red_ony> Lain is a nice anime :)
<Michael> lawl
<Caramel-Tragar> There we go, I'll switch my name to this. :Y
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: cyberpunk series of sorts, that focuses on blurring the line between reality and the virtual or "wired" world. Gets really psychological and purposefully confusing at times.
<Barbetos|AtWork> So... he hands them over thinking that they would agree... after he gave them away.
<Kandarihu> I'm gonna go over my collection and see how much of it is free of fanservice.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Riiiigghtt.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah you were trying to use a name of one of the mods Caramel-Tragar
<Barbetos|AtWork> They MUST be desperate.
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: Okay. Thanks. :)
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: Seeing how they're losing, I can see why. :D
<Caramel-Tragar> I didn't realize that. I go by Caramel Scrawl on a forum I was linked from so that'd be why I was going with that name.
<Everlasting_Joy> All right. I must take off, but I'll be back for movie night <3.
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Everlasting_Joy! :)
<sonicdude558> Bye Everlasting_Joy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't tell them the other two pings.
<Michael> bye Everlasting_Joy

<Sumica> 00,10he found them twilight_sprinkle1
<RAWRity> "We burn the calendars for warmth, and the alarm clocks just for fun."
<twilight_sprinkle1> Sumica: yeah but didnt he see them when he was inside the mecha? kinda silly imagining him alking out just to pick up a some chess pieces
<DaringDerpy> http://i.imgur.com/ger27.jpg the fuck is this?

<twilight_sprinkle1> oh ok

<AJIsAwesome> red_ony: Try a different theatre.
<sonicdude558> Sumi
<Dark_Horst> i vote for alicorn rarity making it into the official toyline
<Sumica> 00,10try poping out the embed
<AJIsAwesome> Take it easy with the pings, sonicdude558.
<CriticKitten> Lancelot is awesome. But it's not my favorite Knightmare frame.
<weegee2062> thats not evan its finally form
<DaringDerpy> I have this maintenance thing too
<pot80> what is the difference between the theatres?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wait. this is a gaint blender!
<twilight_sprinkle1> red_ony: did you try reopening your browser or using a different one
<sonicdude558> I am AJIsAwesome
<Dark_Horst> DaringDerpy: where are you located? having it here too
<AJIsAwesome> pot80: Nothing. Regulates chat traffic.
<Spectrum_Rush> RAWRity: wait wat?
<CriticKitten> My favorite is from R2.
<RAWRity> oh holy shti Cain Marko are streaming their new album!
<AJIsAwesome> YES
<pot80> oh :P
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE THIS PIECE
<DaringDerpy> and then I refreshed the whole site
<AJIsAwesome> SO epic.
<DaringDerpy> someone said something to me? I heard the ping
<AJIsAwesome> Think Dark_Horst did.
<Dark_Horst> i did
<red_ony> twilight_sprinkle1: I am trying everything right now :)
<Bronysith> hey Sumica you know what im thinking?
<Dark_Horst> DaringDerpy: where are you watching from?
<twilight_sprinkle1> red_ony: ok, try a different browser or relaunching it, i think it shoul work
<Sumica> 00,10not sure why some are geting the mantance thing
<DaringDerpy> central europe
<Dark_Horst> central europe too. germany to be exact
<DaringDerpy> yes
<DaringDerpy> germany
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm
<Dark_Horst> seems limev's server for this part of the net doesnt work right
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like an ISP issue
<red_ony> so that's it
<DaringDerpy> vodafone?
<Dark_Horst> telecom
<Michael> maybe
<DaringDerpy> no isp issue
<twilight_sprinkle1> actually i remember now that limeV doesnt even work in all countries
<Dark_Horst> limeV it is then
<DaringDerpy> it always worked
<twilight_sprinkle1> prolly should work in germany though
<shana> Dark_Horst: can you ping 188.122.86.241 ?
<Kandarihu> Alright. Among the anime titles that I have on my external drive that I've watched, I've counted 17 series with obnoxious fanservice in it, and 22 series which I don't recall ever going too far.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/rGJnX.jpg Maid Ponies!
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Is this one of them?
<weeping_pegasi82> yay more anime...
<AppleDashFan982838> yep
<AppleDashFan982838> not a bad anime
<twilight_sprinkle1> weeping_pegasi82: this isnt just any anime, this is code geass!!
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, Code Geass isn't on my EHDD
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<Dark_Horst> shana: i can
<twilight_sprinkle1> these arent the droid youre looking for...
<Bronysith> im thinking about getting ninja gaiden sigma, is there any huge differences?
<Bronysith> from ninja gaiden
<shana> Dark_Horst: well if you can reach 1935 of that then stream should work
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpiboo.ru/120732 huh never noticed
<red_ony2> well this is frustrating :(
<Sumica> 00,10ok gonna take down stream after this ep and see if I can get mips running properly
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: so what anime are on the list of fanservice?
<shana> Dark_Horst: *port 1935
<Sumica> 00,10if that dont work then we go to Veemi so you all in Germany can watch
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, only one of them, I consider the fanservice detracting from the quality.
<Michael> brb
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: and that one would be?
<twilight_sprinkle1> oh, or was it veemi that didnt work in all countries
<Dark_Horst> shana: what'S the command for that again?
<twilight_sprinkle1> eh, should work in germany either way
<Bronysith> Sumica: we meet again david spade
<weegee2062> twists
<shana> Dark_Horst: depends on what you have 'nmap 188.122.86.241 -p1935' or 'nc -vvvv 188.122.86.241 1935' or good old 'telnet 188.122.86.241 1935'
<pot80> aprupt ending XD
