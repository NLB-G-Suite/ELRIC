<cowvarkian> AJIsHaunter: tis a band
<Vordox> =3
<Rose`> oh, i thought wrek was taking his clothes off for a second.
<cachi01> OohShiny: nope they are all almost the same age
<OohShiny> and Fluttershy is a year older than pinkie, so 16
<Vordox> It ain't YT; but something EQD put up
<DocSane> Are we discussing pony ages again?
<cachi01> OohShiny: fluttershy is 18
<cachi01> OohShiny: pinkie 17
<Mutterguy> too many typos theres
<sub06905|Minecraft> all the ages
<JRP2234> wrek: dat tshirt can i borrow for 10 years
<DocSane> I imagine Twilight, Pinkie, and Rainbow Dash are the youngest.
<LadyCanary> .....
<cowvarkian> all the fanon
<Shizuka> 13http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meem3scvuY1r00waro1_500.png
<CCharmanderK> I have a completely non-sexual crush on Fluttershy.
<OohShiny> I believe Rarity has 18 too
<Vordox> Shizuka: http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/GiftGuide/ForYourPopCultureJunky//My+Little+Pony+Ditzy+Doo+Hoodie-120535.jsp :P
<AJIsHaunter> Shizuka: ?
<OohShiny> is*
<cachi01> cowvarkian: well fluttershi being 1 year older than pinkie is canon
<cowvarkian> cachi01: I know
<cachi01> fluttershy*
<boodfire> rarity is thinking about maridge keep that in mind
<DocSane> Twi, because she would have been advanced a grade or two as she was tutored by the princess.
<cowvarkian> cachi01: but why would any of them be teenagers?
<DocSane> Pinkie and Rainbow Dash because I think they got their cutie marks sooner than most.
<Mutterguy> Shizuka they all just saw the internet
<OohShiny> boofire: she's just acting like we'd expect
<cachi01> cowvarkian: i vote 17
<CCharmanderK> Because anime.
<cowvarkian> CCharmanderK: well go fuck your formula
<Kurra> They're all over 18.
<OohShiny> nope
<sub06905|Minecraft> dat hoodie <3
<cachi01> Kurra: objection
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Remix/Foval Music: General Mumble - Babs Seed / ) Babs Seed (P1K Cover) feat. Meelz / I Just Don't Know
<DocSane> Rarity, Fluttershy, and AJ are the oldest, although I suspect Rarity may NOT be the oldest of them all.
<cowvarkian> I vote all of them be 20 somethings
<CCharmanderK> Wrek: "Dat ass".
<oni_link> wouldnt Rarity be in her mid to late 20s minimumif shes thinking about marriage ?
<OohShiny> Fluttershy is the oldest
<Kurra> Yeah, they all have jobs, prolly file their taxes already, many are paying mortgages or whatever no?
<OohShiny> she is all motherly
<DocSane> oni_link: No. Some women get married while still in college.
<cachi01> dont base their age because of their actitude
<cachi01> pls
<OohShiny> even she's scared of almost anything
<cachi01> it has nothing to do
<trixie_squirtle> we dont even know if they pay mortgages, Kurra
<Kurra> Twi lives on government-subsidized housing as part of her job, pff X3
<oni_link> DocSane: but not all go to college right away
<LadyCanary> This is amazing <3
<CCharmanderK> XD
<CCharmanderK> Lol, Wrek.
<OohShiny> Kurra: yet, she's still a student
<cachi01> xD
*LadyCanary applauds. Yaaaay~
<DocSane> I think Rarity isn't the oldest because of the age of her sister.
<trixie_squirtle> Kurra: plus twi, aj, rarity seem to be supported by someone
<Kurra> Haha, GoPro ad better than this song XD
<trixie_squirtle> pinkie too
<LadyCanary> ...RUN LIKE HELL
<CCharmanderK> Wrek did the "dat ass" face a minute ago.
<DocSane> Twi is still a student.
<Kurra> Aj works for her family and herself, pff
<LadyCanary> ^o^
<OohShiny> trixie_squirtle: her parents pay for her house
<DocSane> AJ lives with her family and helps support them.
<trixie_squirtle> OohShiny: yeah so they might not be over 18
<sub06905|Minecraft> http://derpy.me/lhCTY :D
<DocSane> Pretty sure the Apple home is long-since paid for.
<Kurra> Rarity works her own store. Goodness knows she has to file a million taxes and expenses and deductions, oh gosh
<OohShiny> I think the mane 6 are all teenagers
<OohShiny> almost adult
<trixie_squirtle> we dont even know if they pay for their housings
<OohShiny> but yet, need to see a lot
<cachi01> OohShiny: rarity might be like 20
<Kurra> Rarity's prolly getting screwed over by small business tax law too :[
<J_E_Smith71> *Raises lighters**Shizuka raises her fireplace*
<Wrek> 05sit back
<trixie_squirtle> didnt the writers saying anything about their age?
<Wrek> 05relax
<OohShiny> cachi01: I agree
<oni_link> sub06905|Minecraft: not sure if want. I do want some derpy or pony wristbands though
<Wrek> 05enjoy the pure awesomeness
<Wrek> 05that is this song
<Wrek> 05if you can
<DocSane> I'm pretty sure they're at the least high teens and at most very early 20's.
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Wrek> 05max your speakers
<OohShiny> cachi01: but the others are younger
<Kurra> I wonder if she could file hers as an LLC c.c
<cowvarkian> Wrek: I'll do that instead of getting into this pointless disussion
<AJIsHaunter> oni_link: Yeah, I've been trying to find some pony wristbands.
<cachi01> OohShiny: yeah she is the only one with a job
<DocSane> They're adults at the very start of their adulthood.
<cachi01> OohShiny: besides applejack
<cachi01> OohShiny: but its her own business and AJ is family business
<oni_link> AJIsHaunter: I really want some, why does no one make them??
<Kurra> Rarity has to file as an LLC
<AJIsHaunter> oni_link: I hear people can find them, but I never can.
<OohShiny> So, suddenly we started talking about pony ages... so, how long does a pony live?
<LadyCanary> Unf, dat bass <3
<cachi01> OohShiny: 100000000000000 years
<oni_link> AJIsHaunter: yeah same here
<Kurra> She just HAS to. HAS TO! *lounge chair*
<cowvarkian> OohShiny: well apparently granny smith founded ponyville
<J_E_Smith71> OohShiny: A long time, based on Granny
<Wrek> 05drop the redundant age discussion.
<cowvarkian> *her and some settlers
<Kurra> is not redundant c.c
<Wrek> 05it is
<cachi01> i vote egoraptor made it
<cowvarkian> it really is
<LadyCanary> RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN
<OohShiny> It's actually pretty good for thinking
<Kurra> it's cool to imagine how old they must be!
*cachi01 runs
<Wrek> 05it is redundant.
<sub06905|Minecraft> twilight got darker :D http://derpy.me/RBAUM
<Wrek> 05end of discussion
<OohShiny> *makes a rainbow* IMAGINATION!
<Kurra> Because then you relate your own age to them and their experiences, and wonder what they think of their lives so far :)
<LadyCanary> Can we just...enjoy the music >_>
<AJIsHaunter> sub06905|Minecraft: Gah, basic vectors! :<

<cowvarkian> Saturn: that too
<OohShiny> Saturn: learning how to program when you were a 6-year-old? seems awkwardly legit
<Tassadork> ^
<CCharmanderK> Saturn: Then what does that make you, again?
<Saturn> 08,01OohShiny: yup, true
<cowvarkian> seems like a very saturn thing to do

<cowvarkian> you're welcome
*OohShiny laughs together, not understanding it.
<CCharmanderK> Aahhhh, Source Filmmaker.
<Saturn> 08,01but yeah, i started programing when i was about 7 or 8
<cowvarkian> coolio
<CCharmanderK> I think Source Filmmaker is gonna end up being a really big go-around for people to make amateur CG films in the future.
<OohShiny> I hope I can do that when I do mechatronic engineering

<OohShiny> wrek streams are so rare like that?
<Saturn> 08,01trixie_squirtle: it does nothing more than a normal computer can do really, except that it has GPIO pins (which can control other electronics)
<Ryunosuke> ustream isnt that bad tbh
<cachi01> ustream is the best streaming service so far imo

<wipergone2> RaveBrony: sorry thought u was going
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Is it safe to discuss the trixie episode now/?
<RaveBrony> Ill be leaving in a bit ^_^
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeKyurem[R]: Yep since this morning
<wipergone2> SpadeKyurem[R]: yep
<SpeccyRush> sure flies by sumi
<SpadeKyurem[R]> What im getting is, that brooch had alicorn powers right?
<RaveBrony> I suppse
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Why the fuck did Celestia not destroy the fucking thing?
<RaveBrony> *suppose
<weylinish|Blarg> Because reasons
<HoodyKazam> SpadeKyurem[R]: It was called the alicorn amulet and had nearly unlimited power
<HoodyKazam> Not alicorn power
<AttackWithHugs> Oh, is it time for r/mylittleconspiracy in Bronystate?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Who the fuck just leaves a artifact that powerful and not destroy it
<HoodyKazam> I think it's all magic
<HoodyKazam> Maybe she couldn't find it?
<Saturn> 08,01hmm, while sb sets up, imma test out my setup
<Mutterguy> She's at least a 1000 years old and has a Kingdom to run?
<otakon17> SpadeKyurem[R]: Probably can't be destroyed
<Shizuka> 13BUT
<Shizuka> 13it doesn't have fire
<NocturnalBlade> AttackWithHugs: do what?
<RaveBrony> Maybe they plan to bring it back? Who knows
<otakon17> SpadeKyurem[R]: The One Ring
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Right...Im chalking it up to Celestia being fucking lazy
<HoodyKazam> It must be thrown into the fires of mount friendship
<SpadeKyurem[R]> as usual
<Shizuka> 13or could you load a fireplace onto the offline playlist :3c
<weylinish|Blarg> Either that, otakon17, or only another alicorn can destroy it
<nintendo3ds> the only thing the amulet couldnt beat was the art of trickery
<RaveBrony> Inb4 Zecora uses it to gain music and goes on an evil rampage? lol
<Sumica> 00,10give me files Shizuka
<otakon17> weylinish|Blarg: Eeyup hell I wouldn't be surprised if that would kill or hurt the alicorn doing it though
<oni_link> yay fireplace forever
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I had sympathy for trixie untill this episode
<wipergone2> Saturn: hey
<SpadeKyurem[R]> All I see trixie being is a bitch who cant learn her lesson
<Saturn> 08,01jeu wipergone2
<weylinish|Blarg> otakon17, and we have all these ponies and unicorns delving into the occult
<wipergone2> Saturn: can i add u
<RaveBrony> I actually enjoyed Trixie returning.
<weylinish|Blarg> WHY
<otakon17> Eeyup
<trixie_squirtle> shaddup, trixie is awesome
<RaveBrony> Shes a fun character, lol
<weylinish|Blarg> Not saying she isn't a good character
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Well the fact trixie learned nothing from her first incident annoyed me
<trixie_squirtle> SpadeKyurem[R]: well she learned from the second and apologized
<weylinish|Blarg> Pride does strange things, my friend
<J_E_Smith71> I liked how Twilight beat her by outsmarting her rather than suddenly gaining new power out of the blue
<trixie_squirtle> yeah its the first time we saw her limits actually
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Well pride goeth before the fall
<NocturnalBlade> J_E_Smith71: same, felt better than twilight being tons more powerful lol
<RaveBrony> Her way of living was taken away from her, and she wanted revenge. O.o At least she 'sorta' apologized
<RaveBrony> :D
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Hey it wasnt twilight's fault he rlife got wrecked
<oni_link> you guys have a good site to watch the new epis after theyve aired?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> It was fucking Snips and SNails
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Blame those two fuckers
<RaveBrony> Yeah

<trixie_squirtle> oni_link: youtube?

<NocturnalBlade> SuperBrony64: yay moo time ^_^
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64: With UStream you don't need to use Twitch anymore?
<Java> Oh well, time for lunch then
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Did something happen to the stream again? we seem to be swaping stream sites alot
<oni_link> SpadeKyurem[R]: I love the remixes in that game :3
<SpadeKyurem[R]> First it was Limev now Ustream
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Saturn: Who said I was going to start streaming...you're crazy if you think that <<...but I will humor you and say go ahead right before I start >>
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeKyurem[R]: Just testing new ones to see what works but seems UStream is working just well today
<AJIsHaunter> I kind of like Ustream. It's kind of like Mips in a way.
<weylinish|Blarg> but secure and has more features
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I still find Lyra hilarious in the trixie episode
<Shizuka> 13sb is best liar?

<SpadeKyurem[R]> Also I dont get one thing from the Babs seed episode
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Why the hell was applebloom making a pumpkin float?
<Sumica> 00,10soon™
<AJIsHaunter> What's wrong with deviating from apples?
<weylinish|Blarg> Because pumpkins, man!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Isnt that all they fucking do?
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeKyurem[R]: Fall harvest? Maybe picking something from the fall crop?
<trixie_squirtle> because, an apple float is jsut what the competition would expect
<AJIsHaunter> Also, it was called the Summer Harvest Parade IIRC.
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsHaunter: Doh
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I still find this one comic hilarious http://firebrandkun.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Apple-Family-Tradition-Comic-340796537
<AJIsHaunter> Harvest crops usually include pumpkins, if I remember.
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsHaunter: Only saw the ep twice, didn
<J_E_Smith71> ddn't remember
<HoodyKazam> SpadeKyurem[R]: They made a gold apple at the end

<Polydunami> Oh hey, maybe you can help me. I'm not understanding why Beetlejuice is ineligible for voting.
<NocturnalBlade> doesnt seem that bad to me SuperBrony64
<weylinish|Blarg> If I had a copy of BO2 and a Wii U, I'd totally love to join :c but I don't, because poor
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm going down to 0.8 Mbps
<JRP2234> ...
<JRP2234> i need it at 0.5 :<
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That's too low for good quality :<
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Let me know how it is
<wipergone2> SuperBrony64: want egg?
<Polydunami> I didn't have much trouble with the stream, but that's just me

<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: Still getting buffer a lot, but it's not lasting as long.

<HoodyKazam> Shizuka doesn't care enough for high quality
<Polydunami> Shizuka, that's too much :P
<SpeccyRush> ed, edd, and eddy is wreks turf
<JRP2234> you lie
<J_E_Smith71> Hey Shizuka , Poly just asked why Beetlejuice was ineligible for voting
<Jmo> It is?
<Polydunami> Also, I didn't really notice that bad of a quality.
<Shizuka> 13was it not marked?
<J_E_Smith71> Polydunami: Describe it to Shizuka
<Polydunami> I checked the spreadsheet and Beetlejuice was in red.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 le buffer
<Shizuka> 13oh

<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 try 550
<Shizuka> 13anyway almost always means it's in the wrong column, beetlejuice is an A
<Polydunami> Oh wow, wouldn't have seen that coming.
<Shizuka> 13but i wasn't much involved in the vetting process so you might have more luck asking someone else
<sub06905> SuperBrony64 is MLG~
<Polydunami> I never would have thought Beetlejuice to be an A movie
<weylinish|Blarg> It's by Tim Burton, so... :/
<SpeccyRush> SuperBrony64: why your emblem not favorite pone
<Polydunami> Oh, Tim Burton. OF COURSE.

<sub06905> yes
<weylinish|Blarg> SuperBrony64, what's with pistol-only?
<Polydunami> Righto
<SpeccyRush> it's easy getting 10 awards in a row, especially if they have the same number points for the required unlock
<QBAlchemist> SuperBrony64: yup, keep up the good work mentlegen
<Polydunami> Legshot? ded
<sub06905> ..
*sub06905 tosses tumble weeds into chat

<Boltasar> I could take it to school and play BO2 without a tv
<sub06905> nope

<Polydunami> Oh, it's on the Wii U now.
<oni_link> is that the MP412
<oni_link> ?
<RawketLawnchair> Revolver is crummy, it seems.
<Polydunami> Revolver? Really?
<HoodyKazam> Its the executioner, i think it shoots shells
<Boltasar> honestly, why are they saying hostile with weapon
<Boltasar> like honestly
<oni_link> RawketLawnchair: it was in MW3 as well it if is the one im thinking of
<HoodyKazam> Maybe some hostiles carry kittens
<weylinish|Blarg> Some carry cookies and candies
<RawketLawnchair> No, SuperBrony64 , you are not Ocelot.
<aniderp> is dat jaymoo here?
<SpeccyRush> SuperBrony64: what are ya doing using the shotgun pistol, it has no range
<Polydunami> Do you get something special if you use only the weapon you spawn with?
<weylinish|Blarg> and by that I mean drugs
<QBAlchemist> maybe they are only carrying spears or whips ... they dont specify
<Jmo> Maybe.
<Jmo> <:
<oni_link> this game looks pretty good on the Wii U
<HoodyKazam> Jmo died
<HoodyKazam> Didn't you hear?
<sub06905> jaymoo is always lurking
<sub06905> :I

<oni_link> QBAlchemist: nice, Im getting it for the 360 to play with friends
<oni_link> weylinish|Blarg: lol
<weylinish|Blarg> 3 people ruined the fun for everyone else
<oni_link> dat brohoof

<oni_link> lame
<weylinish|Blarg> not to mention people were trying to get around the chat filter with their stupidity when I let them chat
<QBAlchemist> oni_link: ill keep an eye out for you online then :D

<Polydunami> Couldn't you report someone for being too young?
<oni_link> Polydunami: Nah, but you could report them for misconduct
<Polydunami> Well, that's a little better
<SpeccyRush> oni_link: hated that, it's not my fault you suck at shooting me in the back and got turned on
<aniderp> today is the 3rd
<oni_link> SpeccyRush: IKR XD (this game is really bringing my competitive side out, I want it now)
<DitzyDerpy15> Hai
<oni_link> Polydunami: yeah, didn't always work, rep had to be put down to a certain percentage for it to actually matter and me being a trash talker back then didn't help my cause either XD
<Polydunami> Hey there, DitzyDerpy15
<NocturnalBlade> hi DitzyDerpy15
<oni_link> dayum
<oni_link> the whole team was on you SuperBrony64
<Boltasar> but honestly I could take my WII U with me and play BO2 campaign at school
<HoodyKazam> Why isn't he trying? ;~;
<oni_link> idk, im getting a little upset HoodyKazam :/
<SpeccyRush> protip when playing cod: you start to tryhard and all the fun is sucked out of it
<HoodyKazam> SpeccyRush: Meh
<SpeccyRush> just be aloof
<Polydunami> Go with the flow
<SpeccyRush> ^
<oni_link> SpeccyRush: or opponents take the fun out of it when youre not trying :P
<HoodyKazam> I like the league play ;~;
<Polydunami> All the more reason to keep calm
<oni_link> never tried the league play out, what is that btw?
<weylinish|Blarg> It's like...Why're you getting mad at a game?
<SpeccyRush> exactly what it says on the tin
<oni_link> and yeah, I play to have fun nowadays

<HoodyKazam> You lose or gain league points by winning or losing
<oni_link> SpeccyRush: ahh
<HoodyKazam> I haven't been playing much of it though...
<oni_link> HoodyKazam: I would play if I owned the game
<HoodyKazam> oni_link: Tis a fun game
<oni_link> HoodyKazam: yeah , I tried it out when a friend brought it over. Gonna try to get it soon but on the ol snoozebox360
<SpeccyRush> Jmo I wouldn't call someone runnig around with a shotgun against smgs and the like a tryhard
<Jmo> You're a tryhard Speccy.
<oni_link> SpeccyRush: not even if it was the SPAS in MW2 with grip?
<HoodyKazam> SpeccyRush: Tried that, win everytime :I
<oni_link> ^
<weylinish|Blarg> ...please tell me that isn't SB64
<oni_link> nope
<SpeccyRush> well that's mw2 oni_link one of the most broken cods out there
<Boltasar> it aint
<oni_link> its not
<weylinish|Blarg> thank deity in all its forms
<oni_link> SpeccyRush: lol true XD or the spas in the first black ops as well
<SpeccyRush> shotguns in blops weren't that great
<SpeccyRush> only reason the spas was considered good was cause of the suppresor
<oni_link> yeah. that and it was the strongest shotty, the others kinda sucked. and am I right in saying that SMGs are always OP in COD?
<Boltasar> final kill yayz
<weylinish|Blarg> congrats Boltasar
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Boltasar: Moo :3
<Boltasar> ugh, I muted that idiot...

<Shizuka> 13ding!
<SpeccyRush> Jmo why not start at Yahooz he lervs his Mac
<Jmo> Yahooz is already getting a beating for it.
<Vivix> I wonder when Apple officially became more evil than Microsoft-
<weylinish|Blarg> well, I'm out. Later
<Jmo> When Steve Jobs died.
<Vivix> Well jobs was a mean boss, is the rumour on the street
<Jmo> At least he kept the cap on the shit company. Now it's just spilling everywhere.
<oni_link> Jmo: pfft, nah when the first iPod touch and iPhone came out.
<JRP> SuperBrony64: moo
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #514
<aniderp> jaymoo messageeeee
<Jmo> At least Jobs didn't wanna sue every frekin person that opposed them.
<Vivix> Not sure when they started with strange lawsuits and semi-immoral factories
<Vivix> Jobs wasn't in the legal dept. I think
<Vivix> I think they sued crazy things then too
<Jmo> Not as much as after he departed.
<Shizuka> 13CLOTHESLINED
<Vivix> no, but his economics and--legal dude took over as CEO didn't he?
<Jmo> Something like that.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Because $18,000 goes a long way
<oni_link> I never liked how Apple buys things and says the made them...
<Shizuka> 13ramen works wonders
<JRP> SuperBrony64: SOUTH PARK
<oni_link> or when they do something that everyone else does, its better because its Apple >.>
<Vivix> Apple has agressive echniques
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> So do I.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02oni_link: People say that about their computers they built and that's perfectly acceptable.
<Vivix> the price anda gression is the only reason I don't like them
<Vivix> the machines themselves are ok, decent
<Shizuka> 13uh sb... apples and oranges there bub :/
*Vivix lays down infront of Jmo and weeps
<Vivix> my head hurts-
<Jmo> Cause I was busy kicking your head in while you slept. :>
<Shizuka> 13it barely looked
<Shizuka> 13wat
<Vivix> ;__;
<Jmo> Goaticorns demanded it.
<Vivix> The betreyal stings!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: DOUBLE STANDARD
<Vivix> SuperBrony64, the difference is the money point, I figure, built computers are usually cheaper, as for better or not-depends
<Vivix> built as in home-built
<oni_link> I wouldn't have such a problem with OSX, iOS and their hardware if their advertising wasn't so full of itself... That and most (not all) of their consumers are ass hats that don't know squat about what they buy
<oni_link> automaticall assume Apple=best
<Shizuka> 13macs start at like twice the cost of a PC built to the same specs
<Vivix> There are good macs out there, just cost too much
<Vivix> yeah, the price and advertisement/marketing is the issue
<oni_link> *automatically
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: But Apple computers are better, so it's justified.
<Shizuka> 13wat
<Jmo> ...what
<oni_link> run SuperBrony64
<Vivix> no that's just the point, they're the same
<oni_link> run fast
<Shizuka> 13psst apple hates flash
*aniderp throws cookies everywhere
<Shizuka> 13bronystate is built on flash
<Shizuka> 13THEREFORE FAIL
<oni_link> lol
<Vivix> the apple vs flash was because of a monopoly desire, wasn't it?
<oni_link> yup
<Vivix> monopoly is very tupical of evil companies
<oni_link> if Apple can't own it, its dumb to them
<J_E_Smith71> Night Work? Have a good time? uhhhhh....uh oh
*Vivix over dramatizes with evil laugh
<aniderp> no wonder why i cant get on chat here when im on my ipod
<oni_link> or "illogical" or a "waste"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: Well...Flash hates Flash as well. They removed it off of Android devices as well.
<Shizuka> 13cause adobe is dumb
<oni_link> SuperBrony64: mobile flash was always bad
<oni_link> they just came to light and killed it off before it layed eggs
<Jmo> Only in 4.1
<oni_link> *laid
<Vivix> I still have flash on mine
<Vivix> removing it is a mistake because of backwards compatability
<JRP> SuperBrony64: you dident awnser
<oni_link> you can still get the APK for it if you look around for it
<oni_link> but its pointless
<oni_link> its dead on mobile
<Vivix> perhaps
<Shizuka> 13PEGGY PAWNCH
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Apple is best visionary.
<oni_link> lel
<Vivix> Hehe

<Shizuka> 13you are not a very good liar or salesman sb
<JRP> SuperBrony64: get windows
<oni_link> I want to go Linux soon but have Windows on a dual boot or VM or parallel
<Vivix> I am, sadly I guess, a windows lover
<Vivix> used linux when I was young, but-
<Vivix> tried it again on virtualbox, and it doesn't suit my needs anymore
<Jmo> Too bad Windows doesn't love you.
<Jmo> Forever alone :>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02BronyState is Mac Compatible!
<Vivix> Oh windows love me, I feed it money

<Sumica> 00,10Start building your space station Phase4
<GhostColt> cya
<Sumica> 00,10or start topogrophy scaning
<Sumica> 00,10I think there is a sat scan mod
<Phase4> 00,02no mapper unfortunately
<Sumica> 00,10oh you dont have that mod?
<DitzyDerpy15> Phase is there multiplayer in KSP?
<Sumica> 00,10it works with mechjeb

<Phase4> 00,02its awesome :3
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Sweet! I have to go download it now
*Jmo slaps Gold_Demona|cooking around a bit with a large trout
*Jmo flails around
<Jmo> woopwoopwoop
<DitzyDerpy15> is there really multiplayer in KSP?
*Gold_Demona|cooking snatches trout and sticks it in the crock pot with the shrimpies.
<pony_624> 6_9I Think not
<Jmo> mah trout D:

<Fl00t4sh41> It does look like a nice stack
<Jmo> I contributed to the curry!
<Jmo> Woo!
<Pinkie_Kittie> :3
<TrixieMuffin> How to properly build a rocket : Place main engine , add fuel tank ...... pour milk all over it , smasheggs!
<DitzyDerpy15> lolol
<Phase4> 00,02i'll make the boosters detatchable
<Fl00t4sh41> But do you have enough solid fuel boosters?
<Fl00t4sh41> I mean, if 3 boosters are good, shouldn't 6 then logically be better?
<JRP2234> dun dun duuuuuuuunnnnnnn
<DitzyDerpy15> ok..? rockety rocket is it time to launch?
<JRP2234> mica lets go bowling
<Phase4> 00,02looks good
<JRP2234> Phase4 y u no rainbow
<Fl00t4sh41> Then its Mun or bust?
<JRP2234> also Phase4 y u no bed
*DitzyDerpy15 hits JRP2234 with a bowling ball
<pony_624> When is this rocket gonna launch
<Gold_Demona|cooking> One time I was watching the KSP developer's stream and asked if they were gonna eventually make it possible to take the Kerbals skydiving like Felix. And they said yes. XD
<Phase4> 00,02TO SPACE
<Phase4> 00,02pony_624, now
<DitzyDerpy15> TO SPACE :D
<pony_624> YES

<The_Engineer|TCR> You shouldve made it to hold down
<Phase4> 00,02oh well
<The_Engineer|TCR> xD
<Sumica> 00,10you know .18 is a realy good build othere then my camera keeps falling off my craft
<DitzyDerpy15> -_(\
<Fl00t4sh41> That just makes the flight more interesting
<The_Engineer|TCR> xD
<pony_624> 1...

<dishwasher_EXTREME> pony_624 i like it
<pony_624> Well go find it.
<pony_624> i have a season pass
<The_Engineer|TCR> You're not in browser :3
*DitzyDerpy15 took a bite of the cake
<Phase4> 00,02oh

<Pinkie_Kittie> Space.
<pony_624> LAYBCG'
<Sumica> 00,10stage failure
<pony_624> Means bacon
<Pinkie_Kittie> Never mind. Not space.
<Phase4> 00,02the kerbals seem to be having fun
<DitzyDerpy15> to space?
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Phase4> 00,02need music
<DitzyDerpy15> XD
<Fl00t4sh41> That was a shorter flight than expected
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Patcher's being a pota :<
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona|cooking, it does that
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Gold_Demona|cooking it always is
<Phase4> 00,02wobble wobble
<Pinkie_Kittie> Spaaaaace.
<Sumica> 00,10needs more duct tape
<Gold_Demona|cooking> So just keep trying until it works, or should I wait until later? :P
<Phase4> 00,02this rocket does not want to stay in one piece
<Fl00t4sh41> looking good so far
<Phase4> 00,02also lost my main engine
<DitzyDerpy15> O rly duct tape
<Phase4> 00,02was not suposed to lose that
<weylinish|Blarg> this will end in laughter and tears
*DitzyDerpy15 wraps duct tape around Sumica
<Fl00t4sh41> You have 3 more so no biggie phase4
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Duct tape fixes everything
<pony_624> Phase What games do you have.
<Phase4> 00,02Fl00t4sh41, kinda needed that one though
<Phase4> 00,02pony_624, far too many
<JRP2234> mica have you seen my host name?
<Sumica> 00,10you should see it when my camera stops following the aircraft Phase4 the craft jumps to like mach 4
<JRP2234> hi Nittany_Discord
<pony_624> Say 5 games.
<Pinkie_Kittie> To space.
<Phase4> 00,02so
<pony_624> WAIT TO THE MOON?
<Phase4> 00,02need more engines on the upper stage
<Phase4> 00,02and i need to not loose the main engine
<Phase4> 00,02and i need to get the fule lines right
<Phase4> 00,02we will not be going to space today
<pony_624> ;_;
<Pinkie_Kittie> Nuuuuu!
<JRP2234> Phase4 can i has some help
<DitzyDerpy15> phase u made me cry
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<Phase4> 00,02what to do for music
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, depends
<Pinkie_Kittie> Explosion tiem.
<MadSurge> :O OH MY GOD THIS IS THE GREATEST BOSS EVER :D
<weylinish|Blarg> lol
<Gold_Demona|cooking> I'm going to try again later. This thing just refuses to work. =/
<pony_624> You know what im gonna cheat THIS INSTRUCON TO GET A GOLDEN SWORD
<pony_624> *Wood*
<DitzyDerpy15> Lololololollololollolololl
<Phase4> 00,02phantom engines
<JRP2234> Phase4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech_G15 me lieky
<Phase4> 00,02looks like a hideously complicated keyboard
<JRP2234> i think
<JRP2234> my internet derp
<JRP2234> i just want it cuz it works with doom
*DitzyDerpy15 laughs at JRP2234 lol
<Fl00t4sh41> Lets do this
<Fl00t4sh41> Next stop MUN
<Phase4> 00,02those engines still dont want to stay still
<Pinkie_Kittie> Space?
<weylinish|Blarg> and then...BANG!
<Phase4> 00,02wobble wobble
<Fl00t4sh41> A little jiggling don't hurt anyone
<Phase4> 00,02this is not good
<Fl00t4sh41> They only need to be stable long enough to run out of fuel
<Phase4> 00,02so those are the wrong engines
<Pinkie_Kittie> D:
<Fl00t4sh41> They worked, didn't they?
<Phase4> 00,02i wont have enough fuel
<Phase4> 00,02lost an entire tank
<Fl00t4sh41> Could you route your fuel lines so the bottom tank is drained first?
<Fl00t4sh41> That way its not a problem if it snaps off
<Phase4> 00,02Fl00t4sh41, the bottom tank exploded
<Fl00t4sh41> A few explosions never killed anyone
<Pinkie_Kittie> SPACE!
<Pinkie_Kittie> I SEE IT
<Fl00t4sh41> They're just part of getting into space
<RoboGerbil> just make it so the explosions propel you into space
<Gold_Demona|cooking> I'm loving the music they added to the game. :>
<Fl00t4sh41> Wouldn't be any fun if nothing blew up on the way
<Fl00t4sh41> Its not that much speed you are short of an orbit anyhow
<Phase4> 00,02i'm running on fumes
<Phase4> 00,02not sure how far behind the stream is
<weylinish|Blarg> about 5 seconds or so
<Phase4> 00,02the upper stage is full but i need that for landing
<Phase4> 00,02weylinish|Blarg, woah, really?
<weylinish|Blarg> yep
<Phase4> 00,02was expecting more
<Fl00t4sh41> Not gonna use a parachute to land?
<Wrek> 05so...
<Wrek> 05i overslept today
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Fl00t4sh41: parachute is for home landing. Need the rockets for Mun landing
<Wrek> 05i woke up when my class started
<Wrek> 05only got one class today
<Wrek> 05and it starts at 13:30
<Wrek> 05:|
<Fl00t4sh41> ah
<weylinish|Blarg> :c
<Phase4> 00,02clean up some of the ships
<Phase4> 00,02Fl00t4sh41, landing on the mun
<pony_624> STARE FIGHT
<Phase4> 00,02as demona said
<pony_624> >_>
<Fl00t4sh41> Never thought you'd actually make it to mun with that rocket
<DitzyDerpy15> wats bbbbbffffff?
<Fl00t4sh41> No offence
<Phase4> 00,02est burn time: N/A
<Phase4> 00,02thats reasuring
<pony_624> .
<weylinish|Blarg> tiny wobble
<pony_624> TOBBLE
<pony_624> TOBBLE TOBBLE
<weylinish|Blarg> TOBBLE SHALL NOW BECOME A NEW, SCIENTIFIC WORD
<Phase4> 00,02stupid focus change
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm, a KerbalKon
<Phase4> 00,02sence when was this thing left in orbit
<pony_624> Boring
<Sumica> 00,10big rocket
<Phase4> 00,02oh well
<weylinish|Blarg> Now I think we're 8 seconds behind
<Phase4> 00,02loving the manouvers system
<JRP2234> Phase4 how do i protect my nick again?
<Phase4> 00,02 /ns help
<Phase4> 00,02damnit cat
<Phase4> 00,02not now
<Phase4> 00,02i'm busy with rocekts
<JRP2234> Phase4 i cant seem to find the command
<Phase4> 00,02 /msg nickserv help
<JRP2234> i already did that
<JRP2234> hmm its not there
<Ryunosuke> JRP2234: what are you having problems with?
<Phase4> 00,02that is a nice orbit
<JRP2234> its not teliing how to protect the nickj
<pony_624> THEMOON
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try landing
<Ryunosuke> as in setting a password for it??
<Phase4> 00,02ooo, i can see a moon arch
<Pinkie_Kittie> Do you see Luna anywhere?
<Phase4> 00,02not landing ther
<Phase4> 00,02Pinkie_Kittie, not yet
<Pinkie_Kittie> I think you'll find her when you land.
<Ryunosuke> i think the command is /ns register [password] [e-mail]
<Ryunosuke> but you have to /ns identify [password] when you change to that nick or else it boots you from that nick to an anonymous nick :0
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Pinkie_Kittie: But Luna is on Equestria's moon. This is Mun. D:
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Unless Equestria is actually on Kerbin. >.>
<Pinkie_Kittie> Luna can go on any moon :3
<Ryunosuke> if the moon is luna, and the moon is made of cheese, does that mean luna is made of cheese? :0
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Cheesy Luna?
<Phase4> 00,02secretly luna is a cheesemaker
<Fl00t4sh41> Ryunosuke: Luna really IS Chrysalis!
<weylinish|Blarg> Her special talent is cheese
<weylinish|Blarg> and cheese accessories
<Pinkie_Kittie> Wouldn't her cutie mark be cheese then?
<Phase4> 00,02this is gona be a close landing
<Fl00t4sh41> I thought it was suspicious how she was abscent when Chrysalis was unveiled
<weylinish|Blarg> The moon is cheese
<Phase4> 00,02need to save as much fuel as possible
<Fl00t4sh41> and they are both shape shifters
<Phase4> 00,02shoulda bourgh some lights
<Gold_Demona|cooking> She loved cheese so much she accidentally made way too much for Equestria to hold, so it got thrown into orbit and now we call it the moon. :D
<JRP2234> there protected
<Ryunosuke> you know... Fl00t4sh41 that... makes some sense as chrysalis is swiss cheese as well :)
<JRP2234> :D
<weylinish|Blarg> And I'm pretty sure her name was Helga before Luna
<Pinkie_Kittie> So the rocket is landing on cheese?
<weylinish|Blarg> Helga the Cheesemaker
<Fl00t4sh41> Ryunosuke: IKR
<JRP2234|Zzz> night yall
<Ryunosuke> JRP2234|Zzz: just remember said password :)
<weylinish|Blarg> g'night, JRP
<JRP2234|Zzz> also Phase4 is a giant tuna sandvich for heavie
<Phase4> 00,02SO
<Phase4> 00,02we're on the mun
<Fl00t4sh41> Nice
<Pinkie_Kittie> Cheese time
<Fl00t4sh41> Do you still have enough fuel to go home?
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Yay! =D
<weylinish|Blarg> Phase4 is Sandvich!?
<Fl00t4sh41> Or will the Kerbals be stuck with Luna?
<pony_624> Dat face
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Mun
<JRP2234|Zzz> night phase cook
<Phase4> 00,02unfortunately he cannot spot luna
<Pinkie_Kittie> Maybe Luna is hiding?
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02hometime
<Sumica> 00,10need more flood lights
<Phase4> 00,02we come back with bigger rocket later
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, indeed
<Sumica> 00,10you know they have lights now yes Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if enough for munar escape
<Gold_Demona|cooking> Time to go home. :>
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah, used them on another rocket
<Sumica> 00,10I think I need to fresh install my game with no mods
<Sumica> 00,10they seem mostly redundant now
<sub06905|zzz> this game needs a luna mod :3
<Phase4> 00,02WOAH
<Phase4> 00,02that was close
<Sumica> 00,10just snough
<Phase4> 00,0223 out of 720 units of fuel
<RoboGerbil> do eet
<Fl00t4sh41> Niiice
<RoboGerbil> failure isnt an option
<Fl00t4sh41> So that fueltank blowing up wasn't a problem at all
<Sumica> 00,10correct, failure is a result
<JRP2234|Zzz> ah windows classic theme so much nastolga
<weylinish|Blarg> Free-fall to Terra!
<Sumica> 00,10Kerblin
<weylinish|Blarg> forgot to add the firma :<
<Sumica> 00,10comeing in realy fast
<RoboGerbil> makes me wanna listen to david bowie - space oddity
<weylinish|Blarg> The situation demanded it :v
<Sumica> 00,10so have they added heat yet?
<Sumica> 00,10guess not
<DitzyDerpy15> so where is Phase going again?
<Jageman> what is this?
<RoboGerbil> to the moooooooonnn
<MadSurge> Jageman: Kerbal Space Program :D
<Jageman> I think the chute went off to early
<Fl00t4sh41> Actually he's just returning from there RoboGerbil
<pony_9001> Back
<Jageman> to high up for any drag
<pony_9001> What game is this O-o
<weylinish|Blarg> Kerbal Space Program
<JRP2234|Zzz> why am i still here
*JRP2234|Zzz slaps JRP2234|Zzz around a bit with a large trout
*JRP2234|Zzz yells at JRP2234|Zzz to goto bed
<pony_9001> Oh gosh :l
<Phase4> 00,02real re-entry is nowhere near this calm
<JRP2234|Zzz> ok night yall...again
<pony_9001> Your going to hit the water! D:

<Jageman> Phase4: well, simulating re-entry is kinda hard.
<RustyMeat> HAY GUYS
<pony_624> *Ded please enter the message if you alive*
<Fl00t4sh41> Now the real question is, did you remember to have a ship waiting for you to splash down
<DitzyDerpy15> gtg guys bai
<Jageman> is it just me, or does that planet have a very thin atmosphere?
<Fl00t4sh41> or will your astronauts have to swim home?
<RoboGerbil> better get the paddle
<Jageman> Where did the parachute go
<Phase4> 00,02Fl00t4sh41, well the kerbals have yet to invent boats
<Fl00t4sh41> Better start swimming then
<Fl00t4sh41> its a long way back to the launch base
<Jageman> wtf
<Jageman> they have space rockets but no boats?
<Phase4> 00,02i like how i lost a huge ammount of fuel and the misson worked anyway
<Phase4> 00,02Jageman, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02no cities either
<Phase4> 00,02just the space program
<sub06905|zzz> lel
<weylinish|Blarg> becuase priorities, man
<Jageman> sense that does not make
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Fl00t4sh41> Phase4: That's because they have distilled their society down to its most awesome component and done away with the rest
<Phase4> 00,02this next chalenge involves rendezvous
<Sumica> 00,10rocktry is the first tech kerbals discovered
<Phase4> 00,02Fl00t4sh41, is best society
<Fl00t4sh41> Truth
<Jageman> how can their society support a space agency without cities?
<Phase4> 00,02this looks like a good starting point
<Sumica> 00,10entire population lives underground
<Jageman> underground cities?
<Fl00t4sh41> I gotta go AFK for a while. Need to get my groceries before it gets too dark
<Wrek> 05zerging indar ftw

<Jageman> Phase4: is this the demo?
<Phase4> 00,02Jageman, nope
<weylinish|Blarg> That's why they're green. That explains everything, Sumica
<Jageman> i love the giant batteries

<Phase4> 00,02SO
<Phase4> 00,02need bigger rocket
<RustyMeat> ITS BEDANGLEDANG
<Jageman> Phase4: can you make a multistage?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Jageman> you could try that
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, thats not going anywhere
<Phase4> 00,02multistage isgo
<Phase4> 00,02actually lets try more fuel first
<HavokOC> Phase, you blowing up kerbals again?

<Jageman> you should put more farther down
<Sumica> 00,10just need to play the game enough to be able to use cel phone
<Phase4> 00,02staging time
<Jageman> Phase4: i think 1 of your fuel lines goes the wrong way
<Jageman> im not sure
<Phase4> 00,02this will explode spectacuarly
<Sylandest> wibbley wobbley a bit
<weylinish|Blarg> it's spinning a little, too
<Jageman> its like if someone took the saturn 5 and made it the same diameter all the way up
<Jageman> how far till apogee?
<Jageman> where are you going anyway?

<Jmo> You don't Snow :P
<Vivix> I will never visit
<Snow> i do
<wipergone2> who is gonna stream
<Jmo> I still have that spider family living on my ceiling.
<Snow> because if you don't let me
<Jmo> Think they had another baby.
<Sumica> 00,10wait you though I was buthurt, try harder and perhaps I will be.
<Snow> i stop fallinf everywhere
<Snow> falling*
<wipergone2> Sumica: who is gonna stream
<Jmo> You wish Snow.
<Meanwhile> Given how much you seem to care, I don't think I need to.
<Vivix> Snow ;__; why did you leave norway? We were so much looking forward to a white christmas
<Snow> Ié been tripping all over the world now
<Snow> Vivix: i can't be everywhere at the same time
<Vivix> There's likely not going to be snow on Christmas Eve, in Nooorway-
*Vivix rocks in chair
<Vivix> Maybe I can bribe the weather gods
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Someone give me a word for describing a changeling, besides cheeselegs
<Jmo> Trout.
<Vivix> Shapeshifters
<Meanwhile> Swisslimbs.
<Jmo> Swisslimbys swisslimbs.
<Meanwhile> Cheddarextremeties.
<Vivix> I was about to say a very dirty hole-leg joke
<Jmo> Swisslimbsys*
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Okay, anything having to do with cheese is out
<Sumica> 00,10Keep humoring your self Meanwhile
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And shapeshifters.
<Snow> Vivix: i can try to come to norway and trip over some rocks there.
<Jmo> Shapebender.
<Vivix> aww
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: Deceivers?
<Meanwhile> Move on Sumi, I did.
<Vivix> Changeling- hm-
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, that one is in forr consideration.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Now, I can't find my pencil. Great.
*AJIsHaunter hands AssaultWithEmbraces a pencil
<Jmo> I was gonna say something there.
<Jmo> But yeah.
*Snow thorws a drawing tablet at AssaultWithEmbraces
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, is it a mechanical pencil with 0.7 lead?
<Snow> aaargh so much typo today ;-;
*AssaultWithEmbraces is finicky with herr pencils
<AssaultWithEmbraces> her*
*Vivix loves pencils
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: ...........yes?
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Vivix> I use a blue and red sketching pencil when I sketch
<Jmo> You love anything that'll touch you.
*Vivix violates fish
<Vivix> Of course!
<Jmo> See?
*Snow slaps a trout with a large Jmo.
<Vivix> Ha
<Jmo> BAHAHAHA.
*wipergone2 calls a sea pon
<Meanwhile> This took a weird turn.
<wipergone2> pony*
<Vivix> Nothing is ever weird enough!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> My preferred pencil are PaperMate Clear Point with 0.7mm lead
<Jmo> Oh the perspective of that context.
<Vivix> but this is not 18+
<Vivix> 0.7 is what I liked I think, in school- but now I'm more fond of like--2B and HB wood pencils
<Snow> *whispers* not yet
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Or those "clear" mechanical pencils. 0.5mm to 0.7mm lead preferrred. 0.3mm is too thin and 0.9mm lead is way too thick and smears easily
<Snow> pencils, srs bisnis
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't mind those wood pencils, they just smudge crazy when drawing or taking notes with.
<Jmo> so picky.
<Jmo> God.
<Vivix> yeah they smudge a lot- we used eh
<Jmo> This is why we can't have nice things.
<Vivix> Festspray? English?
<Vivix> spray the drawing afterwards, so it sets
<Vivix> setspray?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> shut up Jmo. I like my pencils the way I like them
<Meanwhile> You're just as picky about trout Mayjoo.
<Vivix> anyway yeah, not touching the drawing is hard-
<Jmo> Trout is serious business.
<Jmo> Milky boy.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Vivix: I can't spray anything I draw. It irks me
<Meanwhile> Milk is serious buisness fishface.
<Vivix> I did it in school, but never done it since-
<AJIsHaunter> Milky boy?
<Jmo> I love trout.
<Vivix> if you put on too much the lead would run
<trout> i love you too Jmo
<Jmo> Don't question that name, you'll never understand it.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Now, ink pens....either PaperMate or Bic
<Meanwhile> Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne, milky milk for the Khorne flakes.
*AssaultWithEmbraces can't stand the way fountain pens write
<Vivix> my favourite ink pen was a split-tip- aaah, wonderful to write with, never really drawn with ink though
<AJIsHaunter> Jmo: Unless I find the information on why he's called that.
<Jmo> RICE FOR THE RICE GODS.
<Jmo> You never will.
<Vivix> really? I love split tip, similar to fountain isn't it?
<AJIsHaunter> That's what you say. :P
<Jmo> That information is stored within archives of the oldest codex in the history of mankind.
<trout> Trouts for the Trout god.
<Ryunosuke> FYI - Femme Fatale = Shizuka, Vivi, and Luna :)
<kimplix> hi
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Vivix: I wouldn't mind fountain pens if they didn't feel like they'll rip the paper every time I use them
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, kimplix.
<Ryunosuke> speaking of Shizuka
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Fireplace!
<Meanwhile> FYI the term Femme Fatale in common usage means a harlot.
<kimplix> how is everyone today?
<AJIsHaunter> Fire~
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Fine, kimplix. Talking about pens and pencils
<AJIsHaunter> kimplix: I'm okay. How about you? :)
<Vivix> AssaultWithEmbraces, oh yeah- they tend to be sharp. I had one with a rounded ball on the end, and the other one was super sharp
<Jmo> Only picky people are.
<Shizuka> 13fyi the term meanwhile is "let's cut away from something interesting to listen to a self important blowhard"
*Jmo flails around
<Ryunosuke> i meant in case anyone was wondering who was in that particular pic
<Meanwhile> But Shizu, you haven't said anything yet.
<kimplix> i'm good. thanks AssaultWithEmbraces and AJIsHaunter
<Vivix> noun (plural femmes fatales pronunc. )
<Vivix> an attractive and seductive woman, especially one who will ultimately cause distress to a man who becomes involved with her:
<Jmo> Zing.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Yes, i am very picky with what I use to wrte with, Jmo. Is that a problem?
<Jmo> Yes it is fluffeh. I want nice things already :<
<trout> inb4 trout slap
<Somethingwithponys> oh man i am a brony for a week now and in my faszination ive read a lot of fanstuff. my little dashie was my first and i thought how wonderful the other storys must be. then ive read cupcakes. i will never sleep again ;(

<AssaultWithEmbraces> But jaymo, I don't like how lead pencils feel when I write with them. They feel too grainy
<trout> ...You never ask me how i am, and im your tool fyi
<AJIsHaunter> Spiders, an evil legion of spiders~
<Jmo> You aren't a tool.
<kimplix> i;ve been brony since 15th july
<Jmo> You have a special place in my heart as I slap you around.
<Jmo> You're a part of me.
<trout> =D
<Jmo> Why am I talking to a trout.
<Vivix> I've been violating a part of you?
<Serenity> I've been brony since december '10
<Sumica> 00,10well that was anoying.

*Ryunosuke slaps trout around with a larger trout :)
<Sumica> 00,10gonna have to figure out why it dose that
<trout> D:

*kimplix switches Jmo's trout with a salmon

<Ryunosuke> i sense a digimon stream
<alexxm> woo digimon
<Ryunosuke> must be sumica :)
<kimplix> oh god. not digimon
<Meanwhile> Digimon, how far into this are we?
<AJIsHaunter> kimplix: I like Digimon. :3
<Dark_Horst> kimplix: bye^^
<Snow> OH MY GOD DIGIMON 8fan scream*
<Sumica> 00,10still on file island
<AJIsHaunter> Meanwhile: Too far to keep count?
<Vivix> Island files
*AssaultWithEmbraces fans Snow'
<Vivix> sounds like a tax heaven
*Jmo slaps Snow around a bit with a large trout
<Snow> Jmo
<Jmo> Yes?
<Snow> i am your trout.
<wipergone2> AJIsHaunter:
<Meanwhile> Right, still early then. No superdnacombometaldigivolves or whatever.
<wipergone2> AJIsHaunter: hi
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I keep hearing the english dub of the Digimon theme in my head to this intro.
<AJIsHaunter> Yes, wipergone2? :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Damn you, dubs
<wipergone2> AJIsHaunter: :)
<Jmo> Well, I don't know if you really want to be.
<wipergone2> AJIsHaunter: i am a sea pony
<Sumica> 00,10dub?
<Sumica> 00,10what dub
<Brother_Aura> Livestream ees naht loading!
<Brother_Aura> Also, Hi.
<Vivix> 4kids one probably?
<Snow> kick
<Dark_Horst> there is no english dub. go way
<kimplix> HAH! digimon
<AJIsHaunter> English dub? Never existed. <_<
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Yeah the 4kids dub. That's the only one I've heard so farr.
<kimplix> i remember those days with the movie and such
<Meanwhile> Dubs don't exist, like bigfoot and teamplay on CoD.
<Jmo> Milky milk on the other hand
<Vivix> of Digimon? Yeah I saw it as a kid, Norwegian dub
<AJIsHaunter> Meanwhile: And 7 year olds on TF2.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hey, I liked the 4kids dub. But I can get used to the original Japanese version
<Snow> Meanwhile: i play CoD with teamplay.
<Dark_Horst> its moments liek this when i'm happy i'm german and didnt have to grow up with 4kidz
<pony_3045> hai everypony /)
<kimplix> i remember picking up the video casset of it
<Meanwhile> Milky milk on the other hand is a totally one hundred percent real thing that exists.
<kimplix> £3 it was
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: I didn't mind the dub either.
<Dark_Horst> the german one holds very close to the original
<Jmo> Totally does.
<kimplix> and it was new
<Brother_Aura> And now I ask a question in which the answer would requiregreat thought and highest intelligance, in an elaborate answer,
<turtlegod98> what's this?
<kimplix> digimon
<Brother_Aura> wtf is dis shit
<AJIsHaunter> turtlegod98: Digimon.
<Ryunosuke> actually it was Saban entertainment
<Jmo> intelligance
<BladedWings> yay digimon!
<Ryunosuke> which... wasnt THAT much better than 4kids
<Jmo> Your question has already been made invalid.
<kimplix> a bit like pokemon but with talking monsters
<Brother_Aura> rtns
<Snow> i always laughed at him because he looks and acts like my brother.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> and no Pokeballs
<kimplix> isn't it
<Vivix> Pokemon are cuter, though
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But they have Digieggs in like..the second season with Davis and them
<kimplix> true
<Vivix> little..fluffy tails and..stuff
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
*Vivix ravages the trout
<kimplix> i like pikachu as my favourite pokemon
<pony_3045> fish
<Meanwhile> Oh look, Mayjoo is Gomamon.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Dawn / Poof! / May the Friendship be With You / Trixie's Vengeance
<Vivix> I think my favourite pokemon would be Umbreon or something

<kimplix> nawa
<jbh1145> <HavokOC>adblocker, use it
<Vivix> I don't know enough about pokemon to point out my favourite block of species, but- I prefer the more natural and such
<pony_3045> rainbow dash not canon
<Dark_Horst> HavokOC: not meh, get it
<kimplix> 'Nawa nawa swiming in the ocean. causing a commotion, cuz they are so awesome'
<AssaultWithEmbraces> >can't follow because it can't swim
<Buytoast> normal pokemon are the only good pokemon
<jbh1145> what is this anime?
<Meanwhile> ...If he can't swim why did he agree to being mailed out to sea in a crate.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You havea giant bone, USE IT TO PADDLE.
<Meanwhile> Small oversight much.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> It's not that hard.
<Jmo> Bwahahaha
<jbh1145> this isnt pokemon i know, is it digimon?
<HavokOC> Piyo
<Vivix> What pokemon is the pink psy one? Related to Umbreon?
<Jmo> Espeon?
<AJIsHaunter> Jmo: Think so.
<Snow> OMG YES
<Vivix> Yeees, that one is gorgeous
<Snow> my fav
<Jmo> God I still know the name. I need to hurt my brain.
<Vivix> so cute
<Snow> Espeon is the name yes
<kimplix> dat nawa
<AJIsHaunter> Jmo: Watch some soap operas?
<Serenity> Jmo: I've been out of pokkymans for years
<Serenity> I still know the first 400 names by heart
<Snow> i have a poster here with all 368
<Jmo> Good for you.
<Vivix> I have never played pokemon
<Snow> 386*
<Vivix> I just watched some of the series, and think they are cute
<Sumica> 00,10I think I can recall them if I had a rap >_>
<Meanwhile> I can't even remember the G1 Pokemon anymore.
<Vivix> Read some feral fanfics though
<AJIsHaunter> I know almost all the names, just can't say them in numerical order. :D
<Dark_Horst> y'll abvoisly never heard about ninetails
<Jmo> Cause you didn't have a childhood Vivix.
<Serenity> How many are there now? 700+?
<Snow> Sumica: i could link the rap if u want xD
*Vivix pushes Jmo
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I never played a Pokemon game,ever. Is that good?
<Jmo> Liar.
<Vivix> Hehe
<AJIsHaunter> Serenity: I think 640+.
<kimplix> what's the next mlp episode title? anyone know?
<Jmo> !cd
<Tom> Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 4 days, 21 hours, 24 minutes, 58 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Vivix> I like the pokemons, some of them, but I never got into- eh- you know the games
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: It depends. Do you play RPG's much?
<kimplix> AWW YEAH!
<Serenity> Vivix: Other way round for me, hated the anime, loved the games until Gen 4
<Vivix> tried one a wee while back, and it was a bit too jrpg, and I really just kinda wanted to play as a pokemon, not capture them and force them into battle
<kimplix> i hope it's a scotaloo episode
<Vivix> aah
<kimplix> scootaloo*
<Meanwhile> Jyou is the worst possible leader at the moment.
<Serenity> Black 2 looks interesting, I hate the actually pokkymans themselves, but I can always transfer
<AJIsHaunter> Dat engrish.
<Serenity> Engrish is best language
<Dark_Horst> the main problem with the pokemons eries was the absolute lack of story and that it was the friggn same every episode, season for season
<AJIsHaunter> I have Black 2, just haven't played it yet.
<Vivix> I was recomended black 2, but I don't own nintendo things
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, I've never played an RPG before. Like, eve.
<Dark_Horst> pokemon is pretty much the CoD of anime
<Vivix> I only briefly watch the show, but I collected the cards
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: Then I don't think it'll interest you that much.
<Vivix> now adays I just think they're pretty, and I think the only reason I know their names are fanfics
<YokusaHHart> > Digimon streaming >Pokemon talk in chat
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: How? How did you put that out so well?
<kimplix> the only same thing was team rocket want pikachu, they do pokemon battles, walk all the time and loads of other stuff
<Dark_Horst> YokusaHHart: that always happens B)
<AJIsHaunter> I loved the show and the games, stopped watching the show when Gen 4 showed up, still play the pokemon games to this day.
<Sumica> 00,10lol, dont the leader normaly have his folowers do the work?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, not like it matters because there's so many of them nowadays. Who needs 600+ Pokemon? Like, seriously.
<Meanwhile> I was just thinking that.
<kimplix> dem faces
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: I have no idea, to be honest.
<pony_3045> guess that pokemon - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> 1501 was enough as it was.
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: had my good part in BF vs CoD discussions as well. gives you practive B)
<YokusaHHart> anyways, Pokemon is a pretty cool guy, eh captures monsters and doesn't afraid of anything
<Serenity> 251 was the absolute limit
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: One of the things that keeps people playing is usually the online battling.
<Vivix> yeah but the diversity makes it fun
<Ryunosuke> pokemon collector enthusiast?
<kimplix> ._.
<Serenity> Though some of gen 3 was pretty good
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, online battling?
<Vivix> I like that there's so many, because a lot of them- I don't like to look at
<Jmo> God what has been started.
<pony_3045> guess that pokemon - /)*(\
<kimplix> that face is so fukin' creepy
<Meanwhile> These people seem totally legit.
<BladedWings> kimplix: ikr
<YokusaHHart> in all seriousness, I love the games, not go keen on the anime
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: The game allows you to connect to online battling via a wi-fi connection and lets you battle people all around the world.
<Vivix> I like the pokemons, not to keen on game or anime-
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Meanwhile: inb4 they're part of a cult?
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: a problem that didnt exist with the first 151^^
<AJIsHaunter> As of Gen 4.
<Wrek> 05omnomnom
<Serenity> One thing I hate about the game is: In recent times, the trainers are starting to look wierder and wierder
<Dark_Horst> after that batch they looked more and more like toys
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, like Brawl?
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, that might be true- when did the Umbreon and Espeon come in?
<Serenity> Black and white 2's trainers look like they fell out the sk
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: You could say that, just works much better.
<Snow> gen 2
<kimplix> meh
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: no idea. but i know they werent in the first wave
<trixie_squirtle> bakamon
<kimplix> seen creepier
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, eh
<Tyler_The_creator> NOW DIGIMON?!
<Snow> Vivix: generation 2
<Ryunosuke> there is a pokemon MMO in the works
<Meanwhile> I wonder what it looks like without the sheet.
<Vivix> Gen 2? Okay, well- They're probably my favourites, but I haven't gone through the list
<AJIsHaunter> Gen 5 was actually then gen that got me backinto Pokemon.
<YokusaHHart> <for kids
<Wrek> 05and thats why you never trust an altarboy
<Funkball1> Bakemono is japanese for monster
<Ryunosuke> based off of... I want to say G3

<BladedWings> Dark_Horst: true

<trixie_squirtle> kimplix: well violence has always been used as a tool for laughter on tv

<PonyWatchesYou> it's a bit more complicated
<Sumica> 00,10and that's with out her armor
<Sumica> 00,10and then chat rage
<MadSurge> Where the hell are the monsters in this series? :|
<ekips> mah eyes! >.<

<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<PonyWatchesYou> the worst monsters in this show turn out to be humans, usually
<Dark_Horst> did the hammer jsut speak german or did i imagine that?
<Dark_Horst> didnt really lsiten there
<MadSurge> Oh, I'm afraid, she'll play croquet with her
<thelonecubone> Dark_Horst: naw, you're high >_>
<alexxm> befriended
<Dark_Horst> pew
<Sumica> 00,10beserker button has been pressed
<ekips> oh, she mad now
<Dark_Horst> not the hat!
<MadSurge> NOT HER HAT! Wait, what?
<ekips> the hammer is really speaking german Oo

<Sumica> 00,10care to let use in on it?
<ekips> "Jawohl"?
<Dark_Horst> hm?
<MadSurge> Is the rule "the most ridiculous the weapon the stronger it is"? Because rocket hammer is ultra stupid
<Pika-mon> busts out a bullet catridge. didnt shoot.
<Dark_Horst> probably runs oon batteries
<Buytoast> what
<Sumica> 00,10magic cartrage
<MadSurge> Because magic runs on cartridges...?
<Sumica> 00,10the german ones do

<Pika-mon> magic logic: "lol i dont need to explain shit"
<Buytoast> Deutschland ist ze best land.
<thelonecubone> Jah
<Buytoast> Next to Uncle Sam's Freedom World.
<Sumica> 00,10think of the cartrages as over clocking
<PonyWatchesYou> cartridges give one-time power boosts

<Panda> GilDash, nope...
<RainbowDerpy> who is excited for the next episode
<Kjakings> 7You need to internet-stalk everyone and bully them into coming back.
<CCharmanderK> This is Earthworm Jim levels of funk.
<Kjakings> 7I've already done that like three times.
<RainbowDerpy> indeed
<Kjakings> 7they're not listening to me anymore
<GilDash> Panda: Yep. I've had one hour sleep so far and it's the busiest report week of the year! \o/
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> GilDash: Ouch. :<
<Stormy> what makes you think anyone would listen to me though?
*gunthler noms Panda's fluffyness :3
<RainbowDerpy> sleep is for teh weak
<CCharmanderK> And you don't get much funkier than Earthworm Jim.
<GilDash> I honestly think I'm going insane right now. XD
<Panda> GilDash, I know that feel. Coffee, tea and determination works well.
<Panda> Also
<Brother_Aura> Stream boats.
<Stormy> I don't talk to anyone from the "old days" anymore unless they already come in here
<Panda> hello gunthler
<RainbowDerpy> sleep is for teh weak
<Brother_Aura> Obey boat.
*Vordox shakes his groove thangs.
<Kjakings> 7Because you're Stormy, Matron of Spyrochat.
<Stormy> lol
<GilDash> Panda: I'm not really a coffee person though. I can't handle hot drinks. :S
<RainbowDerpy> OH GOD IT BURNS
<Kjakings> 7You basically mothered the bunch of us for a couple years :P
<GilDash> I wonder if there's iced tea in the cafeteria...
<Panda> GilDash, cold coffee is better
<Brother_Aura> Ze soldier sez:
<StinkomanFan> ...?
<Bronysith> actually, sleep really is for the weak, for the longer you stay awake the more weak you becomea nd you need to sleep to become strong again, so yes, sleep IS for the weak
<Brother_Aura> BOAT
<Brother_Aura> The hevy sez:
<GilDash> Panda: To be honest, I think I'd be lucky if they have cola, let alone iced coffee. XD
<RainbowDerpy> exactly
<Brother_Aura> POOt
<StinkomanFan> :o
<RainbowDerpy> huh
<CCharmanderK> Oh, for a second there, I thought that you were gonna stream another yule log.
<Panda> Dat voice
<Vordox> GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASP!

<Vordox> NICO NICO HAS TURNED INTO ENGLISH FOR FOREIGNERS
<RainbowDerpy> NO UR NOT
<Vordox> HALLELUJAH
<GilDash> What the heck? XD
<Stormy> "Don't swear at the new people" "Be nice" "Don't post NSFW"
<Panda> GigabitHarmonie... what is this...
<Stormy> Yeah, seems accurate
<StinkomanFan> ...Is this the Tim and Eric Show?
<GilDash> This isn't helping me think I'm any more sane. :D
<Panda> Why does that chick sound like derpy to me.
<alexxm> did someone ping me
<wipergone2> who pmed me
<CCharmanderK> Lol, you can hear when GigabitHarmonie gets mentioned.
<RainbowDerpy> mindfuck
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Panda: No, no, no....
<wipergone2> dafuq
<Panda> AJIsHaunter|Homework: why not?
<CCharmanderK> Just say GigabitHarmonie's name. The PM noise is on the stream.
<Stormy> I'm about to give up on SF for this reason.... It may not be as bad as darkspyro, but it's still a bunch of teenagers who can't seem to grasp simple guidelines
<Panda> xD lol
<Panda> what
<GilDash> Can I have some of what they're on?
<CCharmanderK> Is this Tim & Eric?
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Um, Giga? WHAT am I watching? :D
<Panda> A powerranger and a chicken?
<pony_3045> whos that guys?
<CCharmanderK> I don't like Tim & Eric.
<RainbowDerpy> muther of god
<CCharmanderK> MEGAS

<GilDash> CCharmanderK: Now you're thinking!
<pony_3045> fluttershy rides bigmac
<CCharmanderK> No, the wub face would be .3.
<Cypresswolf> :O a view is Saturn's magical van? What an honor!

<Stormy> I'm quite sure I was a little brat once and mods hated me
<MadSurge> GigabitHarmonie: did you like the new episodes? :3
<RainbowDerpy> yes
<GigabitHarmonie> I did MadSurge!
<CCharmanderK> ?_?
<sonicdude558> christmas music? Dayum
<Saturn> 08,01i might put it into the chat embed if i have time later
<GilDash> You know, because I've never heard these songs, I can actually stand this Christmas music.
<Saturn> 08,01otherwise, pester one of the other mods/techs
<RainbowDerpy> ok
<pony_3045> silly twilight, why you didn't learn about spell color depends horn color... Did chrysalis learn your something?
<RainbowDerpy> rainbow NO
<pony_3045> rainbowsplash
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: christmas is my least favourite time of the year
<sonicdude558> Silly Twilight, Trixie is for kids!
<Saturn> 08,01partly because of memories of school orchestra and chamber ensemble rehearsals for the christmas concert...
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Saturn: Family?
<CCharmanderK> Saturn: Your heart must be two sizes too small.
<Saturn> 08,01christmas music can fuck right off
<GilDash> Saturn: I wouldn't say it's my least favourite time, but it's certainly not the most desirable. April is my least favourite time, because it's the financial year end.
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsHaunter|Homework: hahaha, you've never met my family...
<Kjakings> 7I know I was Dari found archived evidence once.

<Stormy> I have to see this.
<Kjakings> 7and I kept the chat strong. when they started behaving they were allowed in.
<Kjakings> 7or if they were entertaining enough
*pony_3045 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<Saturn> 08,01oh right, yeah; i forgot that we load it off ponychat directly
<CCharmanderK> Saturn: Sure it isn't a massive, throbbing something else entirely?
<Kjakings> 7it was just some guy whining about me from some Gmod server when I was like twelve.
<Kjakings> 7idfk.
