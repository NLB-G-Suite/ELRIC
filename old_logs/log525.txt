<Ponies47> I watched it. It was Fluttershy screaming. I had no idea what it was so I forgot about it. Until in a review of an anime I was watching had a clip from MLP FiM. I then found out all about bronies and such
<Ninjazz> Om: Maybe?
<Dken2021> LightningDashFast what's a pony? is that some sort of german salad?
<owlicious> i don't know. everypony sounds kind of forced. You say it even when there's dragons or owls around
<Om> Ninjazz: If you say so.

<Ninjazz> LightningDashFast: Just for clarification, everypony only replaces everyBODY. Everyone is fine.
<Skylands> 10Nope
<Ponies47> I grew hate for them. Thinking I would never watch the show. But then 1 day A classmate of mine convinced me to watch the show.
<Om> Ninjazz: :| <--- Just for you
<Skylands> 10I've been going to bed as early as 10:30 o.o
<Ninjazz> Om: You're too kind. -__-

<Randomnerd> Teh ponies command meh ._.
<Ninjazz> Heh.
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz!
<otakon> LightningDashFast: WHERE?! Where is Pinkalicious?
<Skylands> 10I stayed up until almost midnight yesterday, still woke up early
<Skylands> 107am early :<
<Videofreak1127[M]> My brony story is that a friend of mine pressured me into watching an episode of mlp while at school, which i couldn't finish. I then watched a few more episodes while at home and looked deeper into the community. Then BAM. Brony. Overnight, practically
<owlicious> on eqd
<Ponies47> So I went home and watched an episode thinking it was gonna be the dumbest thing ever. I WAS WRONG. My first episode was Lesson Zero. I fell in love with the show about 5 min in.
<LightningDashFast> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ&feature=g-all-f
<Dken2021> so everyone's passing their brony origins eh?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01-+

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ponies47 is ticking!
<otakon> LightningDashFast: :) that made my day
<otakon> Saturn: LOOK AT THAT LINK
<Ponies47> The rest of that weekend all I did was watch pony episode after episode until I had watched every episode that was out at the time.
<LightningDashFast> youre Welcome
<drf-Droid> y u no stay up late
*tigher1001 lestens to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfMb50dsOk&feature=related
<Ponies47> Then I realized. I WAS A BRONY
<tigher1001> DISCORD
<LightningDashFast> we need an applejack emote
<otakon> yeah, mine is a bit more pedestrian
<d3rb> i know LightningDashFast
<Skylands> 10Y u care
<MaidSurge> Ponies47: I just can imagine your facial expressions during that. "Why is the purple pony going insane? In a girls' cartoon?"
<d3rb> i tried to make one but it was crap :D
<otakon> I found it odd that SO many people had MLP avatars on The Escapist site
<otakon> so I asked
<tigher1001> raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa next video
<tigher1001> plz
<otakon> and then I got told a new series came out
<otakon> I saw a couple of PMV's
<LightningDashFast> the punch has been spiked
<LightningDashFast> lol
<Videofreak1127[M]> Does anyone know any good RP chatrooms? If so, please PM me
<Kimori> how goes?
<otakon> then I watched the first ep
<Spectrum_Rush> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrOXVeZh84k&feature=g-all-u Rainbow Escape
<Dken2021> this was me when I discovered ponies https://twitter.com/DKen2021/status/132993044151668736
<Ponies47> I was very scared. What would my friends think. What would they say?!? I keept it secret until anthor day. Anthor classmate convinced to come outta my shell. So I did. I was soon telling everybody I was a brony and the more I did the more proud I became of being one.
<otakon> and then I came here and after that I have found something to enjoy
<PartyCannon> I think I found my new alarm clock music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGaCH-JRbEc
<otakon> brb guys
<drf-Droid> I'm not in SF

<Ponies47> d3rb: Thank you. I love being a brony. :)
*sagas is back

<Ponies47> Welcome back sagas
<d3rb> its pretty sweet, you got guts for admiting to your mates you like it
<Pinkies4thWall> Ninjazz: Did you still want to see that vid of me unboxing and brushing Rarity?
<sagas> thanks Ponies47 :)
<Ninjazz> Pinkies4thWall: EYESH! PLZ!
<Videofreak1127[M]> Ever look at your best friend and wonder, "I could totally make him a brony!"
<Ponies47> MaidSurge: I had the same fealing. I was like I'm pretyy sure after I watch this I'm gonna be a brony and I was right.
<Pinkies4thWall> Dat response
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Thanks :)
<LightningDashFast> i wonder how this fandom grew so big in such a short time
<Ponies47> *pretty

*d3rb claps
<d3rb> that was beautiful Nittany_Discord
<ComraDerpy> wsirc.mobi for playstation wee ;)
<Dken2021> Nittany_Discord that is a very drama heavy story there
<sagas> I first came across and was interested in the Mulan "Be a Man" PMV
<Ninjazz> My story is complex and odd. None of you would care to see it though.
<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: I watched ponies, liked them, bought swag. That's my story
<d3rb> i liked the protagonist in it
<PartyCannon> Nittany_Discord I cried at the end. So powerful. :(
<LightningDashFast> ahem SWAG
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is a great story.
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: you were a hater and then you weren't
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolfail
<Videofreak1127[M]> The worst part in becoming a brony in my story was telling the friend that showed me the episode, which I kept on saying was stupid
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: am i in the ball park
<Ponies47> MaidSurge: I like Fosters home. But Twilight going crazy. I would never think of that happening in a little girls show. Lesson Zero is one of my favorite episodes of all time. It made me a brony and I find crazy Twilight funny. I want more crazy Twilight in season 3 :)
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF, I told my mother about the DSTWO and she was like, "Another present? Really?"
<HyperMetalLugia> :V
<Om> 3am + boredome + internet = Ponies = Om

<JESmith71> I never got into MLP until Season 2. I saw small clips from S1 but it didn't do anything for me. Then I somehow heard about Derpy and was like "They really named a MLP character Derpy?" I looked it up and saw that it was a fan name, but then The Last Roundup happened. First clip of the Derpy scene I saw was the one from here with the chat reactions.
<HyperMetalLugia> No

<Videofreak1127[M]> Nittany_Discord: Sorry it's a bit of a late reaction, but is there an announced date for the releases of the RPGs?
<JESmith71> The whole Derpy thing plus seeing your reactions got me interested into the show, so when I found out the chat reactions were coming from here I started to regularly sit in and watch the episodes
<Saturn> 08,01it's really creepy; the premise behind Watch Dogs is pretty much *exactly* that of a scifi short i've been planning the skeleton of for the last week or so
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have no clue when they are coming out.
<ComraDerpy> room full of pony merch isnt enough
<Videofreak1127[M]> ok
<Spectrum_Rush> yeah my "story"

<d3rb> house made o f pony merch
<otakon> Saturn: but Watch Dogs is the spiritual sequel to True Crime
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope you can jack cars in Watch Dogs.
<otakon> Saturn: you watch the Pinkielicious video yet?
<Om> I hope ther is an option to watch a dog, in Watch Dogs.

<otakon> they couldn't have though of something a little less GENERIC sounding for a Sci Fi game?
<Ponies47> I thought I would hate the show foreeeeeeever! I WAS SO WRONG! :D
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: oh they will....they will...like EA ruined Mass Effect and Dragon Age
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA is dying.
*otakon weeps at the mediocrity of Dragon Age 2

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: Look up EA stocks.
<Lunar_Brony> good evening everypony
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: yeah, but until it bottoms out they are not dead. There IS not dying in the stock market, only dead and alive.
<LightningDashFast> games used to be good but they took bad endings to the brain
<Sumica> 00,10nitt look at all stocks
<otakon> d3rb: do you remember what EA stood for?
<d3rb> i do
<CriticKitten> Oh, wait, yes they have. Several times in fact.
<LoGaN> when did EMN start i never noticed it
<Sumica> 00,10take your blinders off

<owlicious> all stocks averaged do much better than ea
<Lunar_Brony> otakon it stands for something?
<otakon> Electronic Arts
<CriticKitten> And none of those times did EA die from it. :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka posted a recent article on EA stocks.
<otakon> thats what it stood for
<LightningDashFast> I was like wat
<otakon> it wasn't some faceless homogenized corporate entity

<Light_Latias> 12Mooo
<owlicious> good. It wouldn't make sense
<Lunar_Brony> but The Last Airbender still has Avatar in its name
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: It's ok :)

<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: indeed it is, but its very very hot, so if you're able to control fire, and presumably heat, you could probably redirect lightning at a basic level
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: well, it can also be constued as super heated gsa
<Skylands> 10especially since they are McD's

<Yahooz> [SWAG]thehated5689: quite a bit :/

<drf-Droid> DANG
<drf-Droid> hold on
<Spectrum_Rush> wahts goig on with the busys?
<RaveBrony> Pinkies4thWall: THose are the shiz!!!
<Yahooz> [SWAG]thehated5689: nothing too important though ^_^
<CriticKitten> Ingwaz: It's cultural. Fire and Earth benders both lived in the same town, which led to the birth of families that have both Fire and Earth bender.
<BusyWithOcty> :P
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: Candy legos?
<Rain> wouldnt the air get stale in there?

<Midnight_Fyre> dat twist
<MasterBoss43> :o:O:o
<CriticKitten> Ingwaz: It's not genetic, it's cultural. The family whose spirituality you're born into determines your probability of bending a given element.
<Celes_Chere> Shyyyyyyyt

<Ninjazz> BusyWithDance: Surprise brother!
<BusyWithMail> what?
<soulrider95> RaveBrony LOL
<CriticKitten> That's why there's a lot of non-benders living in the dorms at the air temple, in the hopes that them living like the Air Nomads of old will allow them to give birth to airbenders.
<RyunosukeKnT> wait, what did I miss?

<Celes_Chere> Nuuuu Aang voice

<Celes_Chere> That aint right
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hooray for Katara!

<CriticKitten> Ingwaz: Live like the people, and your family has the potential to give birth to a bender of that element.
<MahBoi777> father of the year right there
<Spade-Magnes> Wow...
<Lunar_Brony> dat purpose
<[SWAG]thehated5689> Yahooz: lol thank you :1
<Dken2021> now I feel sorry for those kids
<Ingwaz> CriticKitten: could you not simply accept a different culture and gain the chance of becoming a bender?
<SpeedyBolt> Avenge!
<Eztio--> MahBoi777: who's taking over?
<CriticKitten> It's a cultural thing, based on the spirituality of the individuals in question.
<owlicious> MOOOOO
<RaveBrony> :'(
<Ingwaz> this could be fun
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<CriticKitten> Ingwaz: No, you're a bender or you're not at birth.
<SpeedyBolt> I wish I was a bender :<
<Ingwaz> CriticKitten: just doesnt really make sense to me...

<MahBoi777> awwwwwww
<Kimori> Its literally just less than a month before I finish the class
<RyunosukeKnT> dawwww
<BlueFlare> 02seeya drf
<SpeedyBolt> Damnit Korra
<mish> there are, and i would forgive him...if he acutally watched the show alittle and then hated on it, he just made fun of bronys from old series
<Rain> what a player
<Kimori> But its crazy how much information we need to learn in such a short time
<Cipher> 0,14lightning and metal are subsets of fire and earth bending
<CriticKitten> Honestly, I would have preferred if they started over here. And had her re-learn the elements. Instead....we get....THIS ENDING. *grrrrr*
<pony_132> How old is that man and how young is his wife?
<Dken2021> Quicksilver those are decendants of their repsective bending, thus she can't do it
<mish> Do i have the brony comunity's permission to smack him?
<SpeedyBolt> Om nom nom
<TrixieBaconMuffin> but all the love movesi know involve bending ...i cant
<Quicksilver> i guess
<Wrek> 05his wife is 15, hismelf is 76
<SpeedyBolt> D:
<sagas> I get the metal, but how does fire lead to lightning?
<dalekkahn> Best line EVER coming up guys. I'm serious. Best line EVEEER.
<adasdad> w00t! first comment on an eqd post!
<pony_132> Wrek: lol...

<RyunosukeKnT> it should be possible to ... unlock your chi points to enable bending again
<SpeedyBolt> :(
<RaveBrony> :'(
<CriticKitten> I hate this fricking ending.

<dashierulez> It's Aang!

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: how much behind?

<MasterBoss43> MY LIPS HURT D
<SpeedyBolt> GUYS
<MasterBoss43> :D*
<SpeedyBolt> MY INTERNET FAILED
<CriticKitten> See, this is bull. And it renders Lin's entire story arc meaningless. >.<
<MahBoi777> that was AWESOME
<dalekkahn> The Avatar Giveth and the Avatar taketh away.
<SpeedyBolt> WHAT HAPPENED?
<mish> MY FACE HURTS FROM THE EPICNESS
<otakon> Energy Bending trumps Blood Bending ANY GODDAMN TIME!
<pony_132> Why is it cool that this 76 year old guy has got a 15 year old wife?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That lady got her bending back.
<sagas> Seriouse Deus ex
<MasterBoss43> YAAAAY!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> NOOOOOOO NOT CREDITS
<MasterBoss43> :D
<RaveBrony> Wooot!!!
<SpeedyBolt> DID THEY KISS
<MahBoi777> TEH END
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's where I am.
<mish> NOW KISS-spike
<RaveBrony> Sumica: So....thats it?
<otakon> SpeedyBolt: bending came back
<Cipher> 0,14my problem with this is that it makes for a good series finale
<Sumica> 00,10so they could have a s2 or not.
<MasterBoss43> My lips hurt so much now! :D
<Ingwaz> d3rb: one of the rules is, drink when ever any unicorn or alicorn uses magic
<Kencolt> mish: Aang was the first ever to deny anyone bending-- FireLord Ozai. Figures an Avatar could fix it.
<Cipher> 0,14not a good season finale
<SpeedyBolt> I saw the bending
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Cipher: thats why this show is awesome
<mish> Of course
<otakon> Cipher: yeah, the HELL will they do for next season?
<d3rb> Ingwaz: how are you still alive :O
<RaveBrony> How many episodes were there!?! :[
<BlueFlare> 02if you're still there, how much money are you willing to pay for a camera?
<Pinkies4thWall> 7.5/10
<MahBoi777> 12
<otakon> RaveBrony: man
<dashierulez> 12
<SpeedyBolt> Pinkie/10
<Celes_Chere> ...Where in Tartarus do they go from here?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> 9.6/10
<MasterBoss43> 10/10
<otakon> RaveBrony: many excuse me
<Sumica> 00,10I think it's KSP time
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 avatar IN SPACE
<MahBoi777> 11/10
<otakon> lol
<Ingwaz> d3rb: 3 shots down already...and only 3 minutes in
<CriticKitten> Cipher: Considering that Korra is now equally powerful to Aang, yeah, it's kind of a terrible way to end the first season. Aang took 61 episodes to do what Korra just did in 12.
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: with commentary?
<RyunosukeKnT> actually Kencolt Aang learned it from a dragon turtle (or whatever)
<SpeedyBolt> I really want to see Tartarus in Season 3 :p
<Ascendant> DRAKE
<RaveBrony> otakon: Haha :D
*Ascendant pokes Drake
<Ascendant> DRAKE
<Ascendant> dude
<Drake> 04hey NS
<Ascendant> get on my net
<Drake> 04oh
<Ascendant> I was going to talk to you there
<Drake> 04right
<Cipher> 0,14eeyup
<Ascendant> but then I had to switch here
<Ascendant> :|
<Drake> 04shadow isn't working
<MahBoi777> and we never got to find out what happened to Zuko's mom :P
<mish> Well, even though bending is returned, there is still the "equality revolution" that will happen regardless, but now without the option of taking away bending....death and impressionment is higher chance
<SpeedyBolt> But...that'd just be cheap
<otakon> CriticKitten: she's a prodigy, she learned the other elements WAY faster than even Aang did in comparison
<CriticKitten> So, sorry, I know people like this ending, but I *hate* it. Too many problems with it.
<Lunar_Brony> . . . now I have to catch up on Avatar . . . again
<Ingwaz> CriticKitten: aang had a penis, which was drawing blood from his brain causing him to not be able to think as much
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<mish> So now she made it better for them to fight...but worse if they lose
<RaveBrony> So Phase4!! Is blur worth buying? :3 Ive been away all day and didnt get to see whether you played it or not
<RaveBrony> :P
<otakon> mish: yeah, but without it's leader it'll be HELLA lot weaker
<mish> yah
<otakon> okay guys
<Lunar_Brony> Ingwaz . . . what the hell
<Cipher> 0,14Amon's defeated (and most likely dead), Korra's the Jesus role now
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: OTOH, Korra already KNEW Firem, water, and Earth bending. She didn't have nearly as much to learn, and she didn't have an entire nation hunting her down.
<otakon> it's 12 am
<mish> win some you lose some
<Cipher> 0,14what next?
<Ingwaz> Lunar_Brony: i like to keep it random
<otakon> Cipher: eeyup, finishing off the remnants and restoring bending
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> time to watch Aang?
<SpeedyBolt> Now Korra needs to learn Bloodbending
<SpeedyBolt> So she'll be an overpowered goddess
<otakon> Okay guys, I'm off to bed I'm afraid
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: And that's the problem. There's now no villain to help develop the characters and Korra is Jesus.
<owlicious> now korra needs to learn metalbending
<MahBoi777> gnight otakon! take care
<CriticKitten> Where do you go now?
<Midnight_Fyre> night otakon
<Lunar_Brony> seeya otakon

<owlicious> i just don't know what went wrong
<MasterBoss43> This rocket game? Lol.
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: ewwwwww
<Ponies47> Chat derp back :)
<RaveBrony> LOVING this music!! MMMM!!!
<SpeedyBolt> I understand
<otakon> so, night all take care
<SpeedyBolt> You get your sleep :p
<Ingwaz> alright, this makes 5 shots in 4 minutes, i'm putting a limit of 9 shots just for safety sake on this episode
<d3rb> oh sweet, kerbal sacrafice program
<Ponies47> Night otakon :)
<CriticKitten> Your main character is officially as powerful as Aang, and they just kicked the ass of a bloodbender, which is the most overpowered bending type there is. There is NOWHERE to go now.
*RaveBrony waves bye to otakon
<Dken2021> nighty otakon
<mish> Understand everyone, that she will have a problem: She has to fight people who can't fight back, and she must balance lives of innocent revolutionaries who only wanted eqaulity with the casulatiy rates they cause to innocent benders
<d3rb> goodbye otakon
<SpeedyBolt> Trust me
<otakon> CriticKitten: THEY GO FOR GOD!
<Ingwaz> it occurs to me...how am i still fully conscious?
<dalekkahn> CriticKitten: I agree that the series was too short, but it was good. The problem is they started too far in, not that the story was bad
<Spectrum_Rush> so Sumica landed on mun yet
<SpeedyBolt> They'll think of something
<owlicious> fancy
<mish> Her power will mean nothing to how she much think about things
<CriticKitten> dalekkahn: It's not over.
<Sumica> 00,10I have hit it
<otakon> Ingwaz: how are you?
<Ponies47> Sleep is for the weak
<Ingwaz> yo otakon
<CriticKitten> This was the first season, a second season is already greenlit.
<Spade-Magnes> Gotta go to space
<Phase4> 00,02oh neat
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: :D
<dalekkahn> CriticKitten: I mean, it might as well be with that ending
<Phase4> 00,02 a shuttle
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: That remains to be seen. After all, Book one implies a Book 2, and... these guys do have a heck of an imagination.
<Devonx25> What is this?.
<BlueFlare> 02Because I could just recommend a camera that cost $$$$ and it would be perfect for you :3
<CriticKitten> So now the problem is: what do you DO with that season?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony
*BlueFlare hides
<Celes_Chere> CriticKitten: They can always bring a villain from the spirit world? I dunno, I'm with you on this.
<MasterBoss43> Space space, i'm in space. SPAAAACE SPAAAACE!
<otakon> Ponies47: well, the thing is I've been on and off the computer for damn near TEN HOURS that is WAY too long for me in one stretch
<owlicious> AND BLASTOFF!
<Lunar_Brony> hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
<SpeedyBolt> WEEEEE
<otakon> so, bye guys take care
<MahBoi777> hey Sketch_Toku_Brony
<MahBoi777> u too otak
<Ponies47> otakon: I see. Well then goodnight :P
<dalekkahn> CriticKitten: Your right. Season 2 will suck so much because of this. But season 1 was good
<Phase4> 00,02CriticKitten, after that, they'll figure something out
<CriticKitten> Their main character is Jesus, and there's no realistic one-element bender that can top a no-limits bloodbender.
<CriticKitten> So....what kind of villain can you cook up?
<Pinkies4thWall> dat Sumica voice
<Spade-Magnes> Time warp?
<Dken2021> hello disembodied voice of Sumica
<Eztio--> finaly
<Phase4> 00,02i had the amon plot twist spoiled for me and it was Still excelent
<owlicious> I say that they fight Mendeleev and his Polonium benders
<Cipher> 0,14XD
<Eztio--> i've been waiting for this all day
<CriticKitten> Oh, I know! You could add metalbenders that can actually bend fricking metals
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> We're going to SPACE?! HENSHIN *Fourze henshin* UCHUU KITAA! *ITS SPACE TIME!* :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: Google... your true enemy
<mish> Guys, remeber, she has to avoid harming to many people and fight a revolution that has so many followers that yet agian she should avoid killing because of the sheer quainty of people fighting for equality due to a few bad apple benders
<Dken2021> Spce? did you say space?
<Spade-Magnes> Inb4 it explodes
<MasterBoss43> SPAAAAAAACE HERE I GO!
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, actualy someone told me via steam
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Spade-Magnes> RCS?
<Spade-Magnes> Whats RCS?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: Dick Friends... your true enemy
<mish> and she stoped the one person who could elimnate the chance of death and impressionment for innocent benders.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, the command module has gyro's
<mish> Think about it
<Lunar_Brony> CriticKitten Metalbending is a form of Earthbending because Metal is Refined Earth, but Platinum is too refined to bend
<Eztio--> did you make it to the moon last night?
<Spade-Magnes> So....
<CriticKitten> Lunar_Brony: Metal is a type of earth. >_>
<Lunar_Brony> that's a fail, there
<mish> Lwal
<Spade-Magnes> So they're all gonna die?
<Lunar_Brony> CriticKitten Metal is Refined Earth, so yes
<CriticKitten> If they're bending dirt, they're bending metallic components right there.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have trouble connecting control surfaces to wings in the game.
<Phase4> 00,02Spade-Magnes, thats how a normal ksp game goes
<CriticKitten> So yeah.
<Spade-Magnes> And down it goes
<Lunar_Brony> you're off-course by . . . alot
<CriticKitten> Also, platinum being some kind of super-metal is....yeah. Dumb.
<Derpy_Hooves> guys

<CriticKitten> I seem to recall the creators basically saying it was gonna have shorter seasons, but at least two.
<Om> Slow your decent out of sheer force of will!
<Lunar_Brony> MasterBoss43 too late, Celestia already banished me yesterday
<Dken2021> CriticKitten two seems like the right number
<mish> Oh no!

<CriticKitten> I'd rather it just end now, to be honest.
<Eztio--> Luigi's*
*mish shoots celstia with the 2nd orbital friendship cannon
<MasterBoss43> Lunar_Bronie You are fake! Her name is Princess Luna!
<CriticKitten> There is nothing they can do with Season Two that won't potentially damage what they've already done.

<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: little wings?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I should say exclusively PC gaming as far as new games.
<MasterBoss43> *Le wild troll plane fainted*
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: maybe it needs to be a pencil
<sonicrainboomer259> How is everypony's night going?

<Phase4> 00,02my bad, 572
<Lunar_Brony> It's hard to Facepalm with Glasses
<MasterBoss43> I think trollplane doesn't like livestreams....
<Rain> Sumica, because ducktape hasnt been invented on that planet
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh god
<Lunar_Brony> f*ck symmetry, just use Duct Tape
<Ingwaz> well...while i can walk...its very very difficult... and i had to stop myself from falling over
<sonicrainboomer259> d3rb: after all these years i'm finally bored of DB: Raging blast
<Spade-Magnes> Add more engines
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rain: Good theory.
<Custard> Rain: Is that scientifically possible...?
<Reikim> Dat Normandy <3
<Custard> :O
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: did it crash?

<Pinkies4thWall> sonicrainboomer259: Sumica is
<d3rb> never heard of it sonicrainboomer259 , just googled it then
<Spade-Magnes> Build a arwing or something cool
<Yahooz> Duct tape not invented on a planet? IMPOSSIBRU
<Lunar_Brony> Rain IMPOSSIBRU! Quickly, I must get to that planet with 35 rolls of Duct Tape to make a Duct Tape Making Machine!
<Om> Breaking physics, one click at a time
<Custard> Yahooz: My point exactly
<Spectrum_Rush> mica wat are you pinkie pie
<Ingwaz> and...i think it would be wise if i were to lay down now....
<Spade-Magnes> Sumica: just doesnt know what whent wrong
<Ingwaz> good night everypony

<Lunar_Brony> that failed
<Pinkies4thWall> Wow. Cipher, that actaully almost looks like an F-22.
<Lunar_Brony> again
<Kandarihu> The thrust is boucing to the left and right
<Ingwaz> d3rb: already had some....dont think i'm coordianated enough to get some more... so i'm just going to lay down now. wonder if i'll be hung over tomorrow, will be thef irst time ever since i rarely drink at all

<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: YES!
<Ingwaz> Reikim: its the strangest thing, i'm coherent when i focus, but overall, i'm pretty out of it. but i dont think only 9 shots will give me that bad of a hang over
<Lunar_Brony> Pinkies4thWall oh my

<Eztio--> Screw gravity * floats up*
<Lunar_Brony> Pinkies4thWall to do what, give out Custard Tarts?
<Reikim> Phase4: How did you even manage that?
<Phase4> 00,02while nearly at right angles to the water
<Spectrum_Rush> k
<Pinkies4thWall> Lunar_Brony: no. break physics
<Yahooz> Phase4: USS Mosquito?
<Reikim> LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAAAAIN~
<sonicrainboomer259> can we hear still alive again Sumica ?
<NullRadix> See, someone said something about a new Rainbow Dash presents, but the only thing I'm seeing is that it's hidden in some arcane corner of the internet, and as much time as I don't have to watch it, i certainly don't have time to search for it THEN watch it
<Spectrum_Rush> comeon sumi you can doit... again
<Phase4> 00,02https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/ksp/Infinity%20I.craft heres the craft i was using, downloaded it from the ksp fourm

<Yahooz> hey RAWRity
<Pinkies4thWall> ohai RAWRity
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No problem.
<sonicrainboomer259> Sumica: IS THIS GAME SIMPLE? OR EXTREMELY COMPLEX?
<NullRadix> good evening RAWRity
<thunderclash> hay RAWRity
<drf|away-HomePC> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow

<RAWRity> Decent movie.
<Chimera> blah screw Mibbit
<Yahooz> I was gonna see it
<Spade-Magnes> Is anything happening?
<sonicrainboomer259> didn't mean to all-caps
<RAWRity> But they had no fucking clue what to do with the whole time travel element
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica deathtrap tiem?
<RAWRity> and they switched up how time travel even worked in their own film at the end.
<Spade-Magnes> what
<Ponies47> Back! :)
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i still got a copy
<Spade-Magnes> Oh my
<owlicious> hahahaha

<Yahooz> Ummmmm
<MasterBoss43> Sorry i was testing sumthin
<sonicrainboomer259> Sumica: treat your astronauts right!!!
<Yahooz> no
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: eeyup. MIB3 takes place almost entirely in 1969
<RAWRity> and there's a pointless jetpack scene.
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: did those boosters just outweigh their purpose?
<Pinkies4thWall> literally?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, mic volume is a little low
<Yahooz> Eject the Kerbats you dont need them :3
<Pinkies4thWall> I agree with Phase4

<MasterBoss43> Good night Lunar_Brony ! Have nice pony dreams!
<MasterBoss43> :)
<Rain> thats not good
<Phase4> 00,02ooo
<NullRadix> later Lunar_Brony
<Phase4> 00,02its like tri

<Yahooz> And then he reentered orbit
<MasterBoss43> I BET 10000000 IT WILL BLOW UP! :D
<Spade-Magnes> FIRE
<Rain> Bomb The space station!
<sonicrainboomer259> Sumica: your streams are so good that popcorn fits them
<Spade-Magnes> cut the power
<RAWRity> so how bout that Legend of Korra finale?
<MasterBoss43> Oooooh! XD
<Phase4> 00,02i like how what i'm suposed to be doing is vectors
<MasterBoss43> I still bet 10000000000 it will blow.....
<Yahooz> They are all smiling because they all gonna die
<Phase4> 00,02what i'm actualy doing is a game that heavily involves vectors
<Spade-Magnes> Move
<Phase4> 00,02if math class involved me plotting courses to the mun and minmus i'd never get bored
<Comet> came here to say one thing

<ponibas> evil bastard!!
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Bad backstory for Amon, no explanation for his power, TERRIBLE copout ending.
<Pinkies4thWall> HAXXXX
<Yahooz> 1M omaigawd this game is sooooo inaacurate
<killerpony7733> Good morning everypony
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Good moments in between, but major flaws.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> awesomesause
<Yahooz> Sumica: USS ded
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> sauce*
<Pinkies4thWall> anypony here have Bose headphones?
<drf|laptop> 03woah
<RAWRity> It had its issues, but overall I was pleased with it.
<sonicrainboomer259> Sumica: who is best pony???
<drf|laptop> 03so I set my camera to keep the lens open for 30 seconds
<drf|laptop> 03went in a pitch black room
<drf|laptop> 03set it on a table and pressed the shutter
<Spade-Magnes> Oh lawrd
<Pinkies4thWall> OGOD

<drf|laptop> 03the picture actually looked as if there was light XD
<Eztio--> omg
<Yahooz> WHAT IS THAT MONSTROSITY
<Spade-Magnes> MURICA
<Spade-Magnes> Fuck yea
<CriticKitten> It also ends on a poor note overall, since....there's nowhere to go from here.
<sonicrainboomer259> oh fuck!!!!!
<MasterBoss43> I wonder who are that crazy to be in it.
<Spectrum_Rush> ALLRIHT the Sumi -roket
<Rain> I love this one
<MasterBoss43> I think it will blow up some times....
<Spade-Magnes> Ohlard
<Yahooz> Unlimited Tower
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: IIRC, they had written out that to be the ending of the series, when Nickelodeon ordered a second season.
<Rain> rename it, Sumica
<sagas[A]> :O
<ponibas> yes, the sumi-rocket.. the one that can make powered flight to the outer rim
<Spade-Magnes> Woah
<Phase4> 00,02dis works by the way
<Yahooz> HOLY SHIT
<Phase4> 00,02i got to minmus with it
<MasterBoss43> Wiggle wiggle wiggle wings yeaaah!
<sonicrainboomer259> Sumica: more like the tower of FAIL
<Eztio--> my ear111111s
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: A second season has been green-lit for months....in fact IIRC it was greenlit from the start
<Spectrum_Rush> sonicrainboomer259: you know nothing of this beast
<Kyu> 07you've never done that? .-.
<ponibas> ascent rate looks slow
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: eenope. It was originally going to be a 12-ep single series, and then a few months after that, it was announced Nick ordered a second season.
<ponibas> ..or stagnant
<hen3ry> it is slow at this stage.
<Yahooz> ponibas: it wasnt initially
<MasterBoss43> *Puts glasses on, too light, that's why.*
<sonicrainboomer259> Sumica: now they all think you suck
<hen3ry> But he is gaining speed. Slowly
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Wikipedia's had it noted that there would be a second season since....months ago,
<Teh> oh why hello Spindash
<Spade-Magnes> God forbid this blows up
<hen3ry> most of those G's are probably in stabilization, Sumi
<FlaschenJoe11> Good morning everypony
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: and the season finale was likely already written well over a year ago.
<sonicrainboomer259> CriticKitten: what show?
<ponibas> sonicpersonfrom florida.. I don't think he sucks
<drf|laptop> 03no
<hen3ry> two-thirds

<drf|laptop> 03but since you're here
<drf|laptop> 03got any suggestions on a new camera?
<RAWRity> So did Sumi make a rocket out of several other, tinier rockets?
<drf|laptop> 03The new CyberShots are totally aimed at little kids as there's like, no mode selection anymore :/
<ponibas> sumica, I can't hear you over the roar of the engine!
<Yahooz> RAWRity: basically

<Spectrum_Rush> \m/
<drf|laptop> 03I want something that I can take pictures inside without a flash
<drf|laptop> 03cuz like
<drf|laptop> 03when I was at Hearst Castle
<drf|laptop> 03they were all, no using flash
<Kyu> 07I could care less about point and shoots
<drf|laptop> 03all my pictures lburred :P
<drf|laptop> 03-l
<noteworthy> who's streaming?
<drf|laptop> 03er *blurred
<hen3ry> those solids do not burn long thogh.
<FlaschenJoe11> Sumica is
<Yahooz> Sumica is streaming
<sonicrainboomer259> ponibas: i meant thye astronauts
<ponibas> sumica
<drf|laptop> 03i didn't learn how to use manual mode until like 20 minutes ago .-.
<Spectrum_Rush> well that lyric
<Kyu> 07so go for most functions
<noteworthy> ah. sweet
<Yahooz> inb4 Ackbar
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: It's been written since 2011's Comic Con?
<drf|laptop> 03well
<RAWRity> I was thinking, and Amon's backstory actually explains something from earlier.
<Kyu> 07and then best optics
<drf|laptop> 03did you see that $300 Nikon I found?
<drf|laptop> 03er
<drf|laptop> 03*Canon
<drf|laptop> 03not Nikon
<Kyu> 07yeah
<drf|laptop> 0320x optical zoom on a P*&S
<drf|laptop> 03is awesome
<ponibas> oh, well, he tortures the shit outta them anyway
<Spectrum_Rush> wat RAWRity
<drf|laptop> 03isn't it? XD
<drf|laptop> 03my Sony has... 4
<sonicrainboomer259> Rain,Rain go the FUCK away!!!
<drf|laptop> 03no wait
<drf|laptop> 033
<ponibas> if they aren't scared he makes them hit water
<drf|laptop> 033x zoom, 4 megapixels
<CriticKitten> Because that was apparently when it was announced that there'd be 12 eps in season 1, and 14 in S2.
<hen3ry> there we go. That should be enough for orbital height.
<ponibas> it still raining there sonicrainboomer259
<Kyu> 07I actually have no idea what the multiplier translates to lol
<Phase4> 00,02i have an awesome trick to show next time i stream ksp
<Alister[S]> Hello Everypony !
<Kyu> 07DSLR lenses go by mm
<ponibas> hey Alister[S]
<ponibas> why the S?
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: most likely, yes. It takes a LONG time to storyboard and plan everything, so the initial writing phase for the first season would have been a long while ago.
<Alister[S]> hmm
<Hodiku> hello Alister[S]!
<noteworthy> i wish it'd rain here. I hate the desert :/
<sonicrainboomer259> ponibas: how do you know? :O
<Alister[S]> ponibas: That I can't tell you
<RAWRity> not to mention actually animating it
<ponibas> lol, sumica, we have fins on very few of our vehicles
<drf|laptop> 03I never understood how that worked
<drf|laptop> 0335mm is "normal"?
<junh1024-XD> ye
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Not to mention there's a core problem with the writers assuming that Nick wouldn't ask for more. >_>
<drf|laptop> 03I mean I get that 35mm film was actually 35mm
<drf|laptop> 03but why use that for digital? LOL
<ponibas> Alister[S] y u no spill guts??
<junh1024-XD> maybe 35/multiplier?
<Kyu> 07because the sensor is still that size
<Pinkies4thWall> Lol sumi
<Kandarihu> Phase4: when is that going to be?
<ponibas> but sumica IT'sS cool that way!
<Alister[S]> ponibas: It's a secret. Even if I'm the only who cares
<ponibas> go BOOM!
<drf|laptop> 03wait what
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, you'll see
<ponibas> Alister[S] fair enough
<drf|laptop> 03you mean the lens? or what
<hen3ry> Eh, in .13, I used to land ON my fins, so I needed em
<drf|laptop> 03as the lens on my camera is like the size of a pen-tip
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Alister[S]> Success !
<Hodiku> the [S] stands for Secretive!
<drf|laptop> 03well, the part that actually opens and closes
<Alister[S]> no
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, yeah, but .14 has the legs
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: It's THE show on Nickelodeon, why would they only have one season? Why would the writers even box themselves in like that? I really can't sympathize, and it's poorly paced as it is. >_>
<sonicrainboomer259> ponibas: TELL ME DAMMIT!!!
<ponibas> success at?
<Kyu> 0735 on a standard dslr sensor
<hen3ry> Yeah, I know. Very useful now
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Phase4> 00,02dis new design i'm working in is super stable
<drf|laptop> 03I don't like DLSR
<Alister[S]> success at hiding secrets
<drf|laptop> 03just because they're ginormous
<ponibas> or is that where the secret lies?
<drf|laptop> 03point and shoots are fine if you're just taking casual pictures IMO
<ponibas> lol... aight
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: ah, but what would be better, the writing team assuming they have 12 eps and making an insular story, or assuming they'd have more eps, not get them, and then end up having a single season with no real conclusion.
<sonicrainboomer259> dem lyrics
<noteworthy> Is he trying to get to mun?
*MahBoi777 glomps Hodiku
<Kandarihu> Well, I won't be able to watch very much within the next 15 hours or so.
<ponibas> sumica, going for escape trajectory?
<drf|laptop> 03OK so
<Yahooz> tanks look almost done
*Hodiku is glomped!
<hen3ry> He's already passed mun orbit... probably minmus too.
<drf|laptop> 03http://i.imgur.com/UNXu1.jpg <- this picture, I set the shutter time to very low, no flash, obviously dark
<drf|laptop> 03can that be "corrected" in the computer?
<Kyu> 07yes, but that 35mm means that on a 35mm zoom setting, it's basically like there's no lens there
<hen3ry> at least as far as tragectory goes
<noteworthy> oh he's escaping
<sonicrainboomer259> minmus?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: >Avatar >Nick cancel it
<CriticKitten> NOPE
<somepony_else> good morning everypony!
<MahBoi777> hey Hodiku!:)
<Hodiku> How goes it MahBoi777?
<hen3ry> escape Kerbal
<Spitfire|Asleep> night all
<Kyu> 07that's far too dark
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: and it's THE show now, but considering the shit that A:TLA's third season went through from Nick during its airing, I can imagine the crew wasn't too trustworthy.
<ponibas> dats.. DEEP orbit
<hen3ry> And trying to escape Celestia
<Alister[S]> Thankfully no one who knows me is here
<junh1024-XD> you could
<Derpy|Asleep> see you all in the morning
<MahBoi777> Hodiku: goin good, u?
<junh1024-XD> but iit's be very noisy
<Kyu> 07underexposed pictures where you can make out everything, but it just looks dark
<Phase4> 00,02whats sumi doing?
<Kyu> 07can be corrected by burning the image more
<hen3ry> solar escape?
<Hodiku> decently, have work at 6 am. :'(
<Alister[S]> nite Derpy|Asleep
<drf|laptop> 03so there's really no good way to take indoor pictures with no flash without a tripod?
<hen3ry> and escape fail.
*Pinkies4thWall has a goggy
<Spade-Magnes> Now to drift in space
<Kyu> 07aside from placing it on something and holding steady, no
<Phase4> 00,02dat speed
<noteworthy> lost in space forever
<Kyu> 07pocket tripods are pretty cheap though
<drf|laptop> 03that's what I mean by tripod
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03if it's like, say, a walking tour of a museum
<junh1024-XD> not necessarily?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Problem is, they DIDN'T make a good story out of 12 episodes. It's too rushed, it has holes all throughout it, and the writing smacks of "we'll never explain how this works because we don't NEED to".
<drf|laptop> 03good luck with that :P
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: The last half of S3 was teased for months after the eclipse episodes. With the air dates being announced, then pushed back multiple times. Then, the final episodes were all aired in a single week, and then barely ever showed again.
<ponibas> Sumica: littering space with Kerbals since.. last month
<hen3ry> um.. do you have rcs tanks left?
<Kyu> 07some point and shoots with a cmos sensor can adjust the ISO
<Spade-Magnes> I'm surprised the Kerbals havent gone extinct yet
<hen3ry> oh you do nevermind
<drf|laptop> 03mine can do that
<drf|laptop> 03but
<drf|laptop> 03it's so fricking old that it maxes at ISO400 :P
<drf|laptop> 03it does 80, 100, 200 or 400 LOL
<hen3ry> just no ASAS
<drf|laptop> 03also hm
<Kyu> 07yeah, that's
<Kyu> 07low
<drf|laptop> 03what does "exposure" do in Photoshop
<drf|laptop> 03like in technical terms xD
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah that picture looks awful if I just raise that
<hen3ry> the cockpit's SAS, at best, softens the tendency to go into superspin
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: If they had, maybe it'd be a different story. As is, Korra hardly establishes herself as worthy of the "Legend" title in this one. It's just not up to the same par as Legend of Aang, not by a long shot, and the writers HAD to know that.
<hen3ry> try canterlock mode?
<Ponies47> GAH! I can't watch the new RDPresents! :[ It keeps lagging it'sl ike bl....ah ah...bl...ha :|
<Kyu> 07try the burn tool
<Pinkies4thWall> guys i just ate a lego
<owlicious[G]> Ponies47: did you stop the stream?
<drf|laptop> 03uh
<drf|laptop> 03where is that
<Kyu> 07you're still not going to get much with an image that dark though
<drf|laptop> 03I don't do photoshop much
<Ponies47> owlicious[G]: Diesn't make a diffrence
<Ponies47> *doesn't
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: with cheese I hope:|
<Pinkies4thWall> bricks will be shat
<Kyu> 07it's one of the expanded options on the standard toolbar
<Kyu> 07but
<ponibas> crap.. ijust missed a whole episode of Rosari+Vampire
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Kyu> 07I can't be bothered to open up photoshop myself
<Kyu> 07|D
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: What size lego was is?
<noteworthy> dem kerbals
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Look at dem go
<Yahooz> and then Sumica made them spin helplessly
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 pixlr
<drf|laptop> 03now hm
<drf|laptop> 03here's another thing I don't get, or maybe I'm overthinking this
<Pinkies4thWall> Ponies47: full depth 8-stud
<junh1024-XD> press ctrl-L
<drf|laptop> 03if I have the flash on and it's just on auto mode
<junh1024-XD> levels
<junh1024-XD> adjust etc
<drf|laptop> 03I can literally shake the thing with my hand
<drf|laptop> 03and snap a photo
<drf|laptop> 03and it's not blurry
<hen3ry> Sumica: use canterlock for precision mode
<Alister[S]> sagas[A]: I'm back handsome rogue
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Do a barrel roll
<ponibas> sumica, where you at on the map?
<noteworthy> they might as well do something if they are going to be lost in space forever
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: O_O HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO EAT THAT!?!?! :o
<drf|laptop> 03well, looking at the metadata, it says it was using "40" shutter-open-time and ISO400, right
<drf|laptop> 03so I set it to those in manual mode
<drf|laptop> 03and it blurs.
<drf|laptop> 03Why
<Alister[S]> Spade-Magnes[R]: What is the R for 6
<Pinkies4thWall> guys do i tell him
<Kyu> 07anti-shake feature?
<Pinkies4thWall> ?
<Alister[S]> ?*
<Kyu> 07also
<sagas[A]> Alister[S]: Oh we're in the main chat now :)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Rebuilt
<Kyu> 07at 1/40
<Alister[S]> sagas[A]: I didn't notice (act natural(
<Pinkies4thWall> Ponies47: candy
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03this camera is old as frick
<Kyu> 07that makes fast moving things pretty blurry
<drf|laptop> 03there is no anti-shake feature
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Look at it go
<ponibas> dat secrecy
*sagas[A] acts natural with Alister[S]
<drf|laptop> 03I've never seen anything faster than 1/40 in auto mode
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Alister[S]> IDIOT !
<drf|laptop> 03my camera supposedly does up to 1/100 though
<junh1024-XD> use 1/100 or above plz
<drf|laptop> 03or down to?
<CriticKitten> I guess I just don't get why they didn't at least ask for 20 eps like the regular Avatar seasons. There was so little development, they had to know that this series would strike gold by sheer virtue of following the footsteps of A:TLA. I just don't get what they were thinking.
<killerpony7733> sagas[A]: dafuq is it with all those letters are the end of your names
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: Candy legos? Hm never heard of em. :P
<Alister[S]> taht's not subtle
<Rain> stop spinning and you can make it futher :3
<mario_pony> Woo horror movie marathon

<Pinkies4thWall> Ponies47: you thought it was an actual lego?
<killerpony7733> :O
<gold> ....
<drf|laptop> 03BlueFlare join the conversation
<Alister[S]> ESCAPE !
<sagas[A]> killerpony7733: that would take some xplaining
<hen3ry> there is no escape from Celestia today
<junh1024-XD> shorter shutter speeds = less blurry, bit dimmer
<junh1024-XD> *but
<drf|laptop> 03er wait
<drf|laptop> 03I can do up to 1/1000
<drf|laptop> 03or down
<killerpony7733> sagas[A]: i'm all up for explaining :D
<BlueFlare> 02hurr
<drf|laptop> 03what's a "good" amount to do
*sagas[A] a wild sagas fled!
<drf|laptop> 03even with a flash
<Alister[S]> sagas[A]: Ok go ahead tell them
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: It sounded that way. But there was this one time I did swallow a lego it was only a 1x1 stud :P
<hen3ry> ok, perhaps I stand corrected...
<Kyu> 07anything faster than 1/100 should eliminate most blur
<sagas[A]> killerpony7733: Well we're kinda together now :3
<Rain> Epic!
<hen3ry> Didn't think you had the RCS fuel left to do it, but... ok.
*sagas[A] holds Alister[S] hand
<Rain> Sumica is going to the stars!
*Alister[S] blushes
<Pinkies4thWall> Ponies47: so you actually did eventually shit bricks?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Woooooo
<killerpony7733> sagas[A]: uh ok
<hen3ry> 13000
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: I was young so IDK :p
<drf|laptop> 03woah
<Ponies47> Man I wasted so much time and money on legos :|
<drf|laptop> 03doing 1/1000 with flash actually looks good xD
<Pinkies4thWall> I once ate a nickel
<ponibas> lol, more kerbals will die tongiht because they collided with a spent booster
<drf|laptop> 03but ISO80? Is that normal?
<JRP2234> Sumica
<drf|laptop> 03I have it in manual mode, but with "auto ISO"
<junh1024-XD> its OK
<junh1024-XD> lower ISO = lower noise but dimmer
<hen3ry> yeah, that is escape
<Kyu> 07lol
<drf|laptop> 03mfw
<JRP2234> sumica can i ask somthing
<junh1024-XD> it's a balancing act of 3 parameters
<hen3ry> it'll just take a LONG time.
<drf|laptop> 03even with manual mode on 1/1000 it blurs like crazy when I shake it
<junh1024-XD> ISO, shutter, and aperture
<Kyu> 07front-facing flash...and looking 'good'
<drf|laptop> 03APERTURE SCIENCE
<BlueFlare> 02If I want good lighting but also want fast speeds, I set the aperture to 2.5-3.5
<Kyu> 07that just amuses me
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: with cheese?
<drf|laptop> 03Kyu I'm not a professional :P
<JRP2234> where is dickshep
<drf|laptop> 03uh
<drf|laptop> 03isn't 2.5 really slo?
<Hogia|Minecraft> 2...I just died as soon as I joined a server :|

<Sunburst> I like pinkie pie
<drf|laptop> 03my camera does it in terms of 1/x
<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: sadly the nickel was before i realized what cheese meant to me.
<Sunburst> DUR HERP
<ponibas> hello Sunburst
<drf|laptop> 03like 40 is 1/40 seconds
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Sunburst> Hi
<noteworthy> dat yay
<Kyu> 072.5 aperture is really wide
<Sunburst> ponibas
<drf|laptop> 03also Kyu/ BlueFlare, what is "EV"?
<Kyu> 07you get less depth of field
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: I understand
<hen3ry> yeah, needs warp 1 million.
<drf|laptop> 03like it goes from -2EV to +2EV
<JRP2234> Sumica cheat engin
<Kyu> 07might be manual light settings
<Sunburst> THIS DAY IS GOING TO BE PERFECT THE KIND OF DAY OF WHICH I DREAMED SINCE I WAS SMALL
<BlueFlare> 02true Kyu, but if it's really dark, that's better than a high ISO
<hen3ry> lot of debris at where I assume Minmus and Mun are.
<Kyu> 07yeah
<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: i has wensleydaletonight
<Sunburst> ERRYPONII WILL GATHER ROUND

<Sunburst> C AI LUK <3 LY IN MY GOWN
<drf|laptop> 03ah hm
<Sunburst> <3LY
<drf|laptop> 03it does seem to be a manual light adjustment
<hen3ry> good thing Kerbs don't need to eat drink or breathe. Cause they're not getting back home
<drf|laptop> 03but what *is* EV?
<Sunburst> <3LY IN MY GOWN
<noteworthy> oh no singing
<drf|laptop> 03and don't say effort values or I smack you
<Yahooz> dat allcap singing
<JRP2234> sumica blow stuff up
<Pinkies4thWall> dat autokick
<Sunburst> WUT DEY DUNT NO IZ DAT AI HAV FULED DEM ALLL
<ponibas> think he;ll trigger autokick?
<Kyu> 07exposure value
<drf|laptop> 03hm.
<BlueFlare> 02EV stands for exposure value
<Yahooz> maybe
<drf|laptop> 03ah THAT's aperture
<noteworthy> im calling grammar police
<Yahooz> if he sings fast enough
<drf|laptop> 03the two cnoices I have
<drf|laptop> 03*choices
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: Wensleydale?
<Spectrum_Rush> ponibas: im hoping'
<drf|laptop> 032.8 and 5.6
<drf|laptop> 03o.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Stream?
<drf|laptop> 03*o.o
<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: english. very tasty
<panda> Who here is on the east coast??????
<Sumica> 00,10suppose I could continue a bit on dickshep
<Sunburst> ASDFJKLL;
<Kyu> 07lol
<JRP2234> yay
<drf|laptop> 03is bigger better or?
<Sunburst> :);):P
<Yahooz> dickshep?
<drf|laptop> 035.6 seems to make it brighter but blurrier?
<Yahooz> waaaaa?
<drf|laptop> 03granted it's a tiny LCD :P
<ponibas> Sumica! you broke my stream!!
<Sumica> 00,10or some one else can take over streaming soon if they want.
<Kandarihu> I'm in ET but not on the coast
<JRP2234> can i?
<Kyu> 075.6 would make it darker
<Pinkies4thWall> dat kick
<noteworthy> phase take over
<sonicrainboomer259> IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII'MM back :)
<drf|laptop> 03hm.
<drf|laptop> 03When the zoom is set fully to the W side, you can select an aperture, F2.8 or F5.6.
<drf|laptop> 03When the zoom is set fully to the T side, you can select an aperture, F5.2 or F10.
<drf|laptop> 03You can select a shutter speed from 1/1000 to 30 seconds.
<drf|laptop> 03The difference between the settings and proper exposure judged by the camera appears as an EV value
<drf|laptop> 03(page 31) on the screen. 0EV indicates the value judged as the most suitable by the camera.
<drf|laptop> 03from the manual
<Spectrum_Rush> my hope was answered
<drf|laptop> 03oh you know what else I don't get
<drf|laptop> 03why does zoom make the picture blur easier
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<drf|laptop> 03given the same settings
<JRP2234> sumica i miss dickshep
<noteworthy> so you can do youre ksp trick thing
<Kyu> 07because that's just how optics work lol
<drf|laptop> 03odd
<drf|laptop> 03well
<ponibas> .. ow my arse
<sonicrainboomer259> I have decided to down load Kerbal Space Program tommorow morning!!
<drf|laptop> 03thankfully with these new over 9000 gigapixel cameras
<drf|laptop> 03you can just not zoom
<drf|laptop> 03and crop
<drf|laptop> 03:{
<drf|laptop> 03*:P
<panda> Sumica xD
*drf|laptop runs
<drf|laptop> 03nah but like, going from 4MP to like 12+
<drf|laptop> 03is a huge leap
<ponibas> ;map
<ponibas> lmao*
<drf|laptop> 03someone was saying 35mm film is equivalent to 12-15MP, true or false
<Kyu> 07more
<BlueFlare> 02The lower the aperture the bigger the opening is thus the brighter the photo is.
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma finish something quickly then if someone else hasnt taken over i'll show my trick
<BlueFlare> 02The higher the aperture is the dimmer the photo is. High aperture also raises depth of field
<Kyu> 07something like 30
<hen3ry> trick?
<MahBoi777> HAPPY BIRTHDAY panda!
<ImOkayWithThis|Hugs> Happy birthday panda
<BlueFlare> 02^
<Twi_Fi> Happy Birthday panda!
<drf|laptop> 03really?
<Sumica> 00,10well lets see how out of date the game is
<hen3ry> what is this trickery?
<Kyu> 07yep
<panda> O_o
<drf|laptop> 03well, before it starts getting noijsy, right?
<drf|laptop> 03-j
<JRP2234> Phase4 but i want dick shep
<drf|laptop> 03technically you can scan at whatever resolution you want xD
<Kandarihu> Alright
<mario_pony> panda: Happy Birthday!!!!!!!
<noteworthy> its a trick for bunnehs not kids
<Kyu> 07you don't scan film lol
<drf|laptop> 03BlueFlare what do you mean by depth of fiweld
<drf|laptop> 03*field
<sonicrainboomer259> nobody's being responded to!!here's my chance........BOOOOOOBIES
<JRP2234> lol my thing says .co.nz
<drf|laptop> 03how do you turn film into digital the
<drf|laptop> 03n
*Om SUPAH PAWNCH!
<MahBoi777> Pawnch!
<Kyu> 07well, you /can/
<hen3ry> a trick for bunnehs? So... he's making more rockets out of other rockets?
<Om> panda: Its your Brithday?
<Kyu> 07but that's not how pictures are printed
<hen3ry> cute lil baby rockets?
<noteworthy> Lol i hope he does that xD
<panda> Om on the east coast ^-^
<ponibas> he;s gonna duct tape 3 of those towers of doom together
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but if you're talking megapixels
<ponibas> see if he can push the mun
<drf|laptop> 03that involves scanning?
<drf|laptop> 03also LOL junh1024-XD you ever use histograms?
<flutter_spin> Any pony else here watched "Brave"?
<Om> panda: Oh I see, then no birthday wishes fo u!
<drf|laptop> 03for some reason all mine are skewed to the left which means "too dark" xD
<BlueFlare> 02the more depth of field you have, the less blurry out of focus objects are
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<sonicrainboomer259> goooood night,everpony!!!!
<drf|laptop> 03so if you want some cinematic "everything behind my subject is blurry", you use lower aperture/
<drf|laptop> 03?
<Sumica> 00,10ok because it has been a long time.
<BlueFlare> 02yep
<ponibas> dang nabbit.. TERA still patching
<panda> Om xD at 12am yes ^-^
<flutter_spin> :( I wish Brave was better
<Kyu> 07when a negative is exposed onto photo paper, you can get a much larger picture out of a 35mm film camera than you can most DSLRs before they start to turn fuzzy
<Om> panda: I'll try to be in bed by then
<panda> Om :(
<sonicrainboomer259> good night good night good NIGHT!!!:'(
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03I remember back in the 90s
<Om> panda: :I kidding
<BlueFlare> 02and if you want nothing to be blurry in the background, then you would use a number like f/11-f/25
<drf|laptop> 03people printing life sized posters out of 640x480 photos
<drf|laptop> 03it was funny :P
<Kyu> 07they're 'equivalent,' but not really compared side by side
<drf|laptop> 03also LOL Sony
<drf|laptop> 03Selects the still image quality.
<drf|laptop> 03Fine (FINE) Records with high quality (low compression).
<drf|laptop> 03Standard (STD) Records with standard quality (high compression).
<drf|laptop> 03Why would anybody use standard?
<panda> Om :)
<drf|laptop> 03like seirously
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03*seriously
<Kyu> 07saves on space
<drf|laptop> 03woah multi-burst mode, that's what my dad's DSLR does
<drf|laptop> 03This camera is awesome... shame it's old :/
<Kyu> 07at least back when memory was small
<drf|laptop> 03it eats up a set of AA's like every 10 minutes
<drf|laptop> 03and 4 megapixels is annoyingly small by today's standards
<BlueFlare> 02I have a photography e-book I can give you if you want drf XD
<Om> I killed the chat :'(
<Alister[S]> chat derp ?
<Alister[S]> nvm
<ponibas> newp
<ponibas> just got really queit
<ponibas> queit
<ponibas> ./.....
<flutter_spin> well, I was seeing if anyone here saw "Brave"
<ponibas> quiet
<drf|laptop> 03You cannot use the following functions in the [Multi Burst] mode:
<Alister[S]> crap
<drf|laptop> 03 Smart zoom
<drf|laptop> 03 Flash
<drf|laptop> 03Lame.
<Alister[S]> wrong channel
<drf|laptop> 03my dad's DSLR will do flash burst mode, it's just slow obviously
<Kyu> 07that
<noteworthy> everybody quiet now :(
<Kyu> 07sounds dumb
<flutter_spin> but since there wasn't a response and there is no stream, I might as well just go to bed
<Sumica> 00,10sorry for delay had to patch
<BlueFlare> 02also drf
<drf|laptop> 03what, burst mode?
<drf|laptop> 03it's nice when you want to take loads of pictures XD
<BlueFlare> 02what's your price range?
<Sumica> 00,10will set up shortly
<drf|laptop> 03as low as possible
*drf|laptop hides
<Kyu> 07flash on multi...
<ponibas> what is this?
<ponibas> well, going to be?
<drf|laptop> 03that $300 one I found is a bit on the expensive side, really
<Kyu> 07wait, no
<Kyu> 07I'm thinking of multiple exposure
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hope there are no leaks.
<Pinkies4thWall> Ninjazz: did you like the rarity vid?
<panda> Om hehe i knw you you are aweomse :)
<junh1024-XD> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16830120525 <
<junh1024-XD> [16:00] <junh1024-XD> PowerShot SX150
<junh1024-XD> $250
<BlueFlare> 02so it's around $3900?
<Kyu> 07but either way
<BlueFlare> 02$300*
<Om> panda: Wat?
<panda> Pinkies4thWall there was a rarity vid???? O_o
<drf|laptop> 03yeah BlueFlare
<ponibas> evenin Nittany
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Kyu> 07that means your flash doesn't charge fast enough
<panda> Om yu are awesome :)
<drf|laptop> 03you know, where oyu hold down the shutter button and it takes pictures as quick sa possible?
<drf|laptop> 03*as
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was about to tell flutter_spin goodnight :<
<Kyu> 07yeah
<drf|laptop> 03even if it has to recharge the flash, so what
<drf|laptop> 03mine just goes "LOL NO FLASH"
<Pinkies4thWall> panda: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJT-WKb7dNU&feature=plcp
<Om> panda: Even though I dissagre, I'll say thank you
<Kyu> 07recharging a small flash takes time
<BlueFlare> 02my camera can do that and focus at the same time
<Kyu> 07so if you did burst
<Kyu> 07you'd have most of your pics with no flash
<Kyu> 07and some with
<panda> Om but you are like the most awesome filly next to... um.... many others ^-^
*ponibas waits for it to be midnight to be able to say Happy Birthday to panda
<panda> ponibas O_o
<drf|laptop> 03my dad's will just fully recharge the flash
<drf|laptop> 03so it takes a second or two between shots
<drf|laptop> 03but still lets you be lazy :P
<Yahooz> BUTT CLENCHING UUUURRR
<Om> panda: Not a filly >_>
<drf|laptop> 03his camera is cool except that it's huge
<drf|laptop> 03and you can't use the LCD

<Eztio--> should i go to bed or watch this?
<drf|laptop> 03didn't I just say I don't want DSLRs?
<Sylandest> panda: yay!
<drf|laptop> 03I need something that can fit in a pocket :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> havent seen mass effect in a while
<Eztio--> gppdnight everyone
<killerpony7733> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: you and me both
<FlaschenJoe11> I love the Tuchanka mission
<drf|laptop> 03B & W ( ) Records the image in monochrome (black and white).
<drf|laptop> 03Sepia ( ) Records the image in sepia (like an old photograph).
<drf|laptop> 03yeah OK
<drf|laptop> 03because I totally can't just do t.hat later in an image editor
<ponibas> lol, i was still seeing the capsule in KSP but i was heaing the audio from this
<panda> Sylandest ^-^
<BlueFlare> 02fit it in a car!
*BlueFlare runs
<Irish_Pony> I always did hate the Mass Effect Series :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> guessing Sumica is playing
<noteworthy> ded
<ponibas> lol dat grenade
<Om> Irish_Pony: I always hated lepercons!
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I think I'm hungry... O.O
<drf|laptop> 03random question: do auto-focus illuminators help at all?
<Irish_Pony> Om: :|
<drf|laptop> 03other than blinding your subject xD
<panda> SuperBrony64 want some cookies?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02YEAH :D
<FlaschenJoe11> Kalros is best Giant Worm
<Irish_Pony> SuperBrony64: Im dyung for food ;_;
<Irish_Pony> *dying
*panda gives SuperBrony64 some cookies
<Om> Irish_Pony: :3
*SuperBrony64 hooves Irish_Pony a cookie and noms on his own
<Kandarihu> I don't think I'm going to be able to stay awake long enough to see the infamous ending or Phase4's trick.
<gold> i'm bored....
<panda> SuperBrony64 those are my last ones, now them good ^-^
<Kyu> 07those also eliminate red eye don't they?
<BlueFlare> 02they can help
<panda> Nom*
<Irish_Pony> SuperBrony64: DA COOKIEZ!!! *eats it like a savage*
<drf|laptop> 03well
<BlueFlare> 02my dSLR has one
<Phase4> 00,02never let me pilot a real rocket
<Phase4> 00,02NEVER
<JRP2234[Web]> lawl
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: :D
<BlueFlare> 02most canons do
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: Meanwhile in Russia....
<drf|laptop> 03I know if you use red eye reduction mode, it makes the camera flash like 5 times instead of just once
*ponibas goes to make a fresh batch of cookies
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Phase4> 00,02in all srsness, i blame the game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rockets are computer-piloted for the most part.
<Phase4> 00,02it lacks many instrimuents you realy need
<drf|laptop> 03any idea why? XD
<Phase4> 00,02dat moment when you fail epic hard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The game is in development, so they'll be added.
<Phase4> 00,02but the rocket you built is soo powerfull you allmost end up in orbit anyway
*gold turns on pokemon gold
<FlareChaser> whos Cipher? lol
<BlueFlare> 02you're sure you don't want a dSLR? :P
<drf|laptop> 03yes.
<Cipher> 0,14me
<Rain> Yeah, Wrek! Make it quick! XD
<ponibas> Saxy
<FlareChaser> oh
<drf|laptop> 03I want something similar in size to what I have
<JRP2234[Web]> sumica where are we?
<FlaschenJoe11> is still Sumica Streaming?
<drf|laptop> 03just... better
<FlareChaser> hi saxy :3
<drf|laptop> 03higher resolution, better zoom, so on
<drf|laptop> 03apparently mine has enough features as-is minus the lack of a higher ISO mode
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh Wrek is playing
<Pinkies4thWall> Cipher: wednesday next week sound good?
<Cipher> 0,14sure
<sagas[A]> well im heading to bed
<JRP2234[Web]> then ded
<ponibas> night sagas
<BlueFlare> 02http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/digital_cameras/powershot_sx130_is <-- have you looked at this camera yet? It's a point and shoot
<BlueFlare> 02derp
<Kyu> 07the multi-flash thing is to give eyes time to adjust to brighter light
<FlaschenJoe11> How did you play this mission, Cure or no Cure
<JRP2234[Web]> wait sumica was that a dick move?
<Irish_Pony> :D
<BlueFlare> 02has 12x zoom
<Spade-Magnes[R]> aw
<Kyu> 07since pupils are wider in darker places that would require a flash
<ponibas> sumica.. i sense some paragon in you
<drf|laptop> 03so that's what makes red-eye?
<JRP2234[Web]> sumica HUIHUIAWHUIWHUIWHUIAWIHUAWHUIWHUIWAHUI there has to br
<JRP2234[Web]> be*
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> there are no dick moves.. there are only super troll dick moves
<drf|laptop> 03that...looks really big for a point and shoot o.o
<Kyu> 07red eye is the sudden light making it to the back of your eye and reflecting back
<ponibas> you're oozing something
<ponibas> :D
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03I just hate blinding the people I'm taking pictures of
<BlueFlare> 02>Canon
<BlueFlare> 02they like making big cameras
<Rukario> o-O
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<drf|laptop> 03plus removing red-eye in photoshop isn't too hard
<Eddmario> Is this the real life?
<ponibas> you? put something into orbit??
<Rukario> how about adding red-eye?
<Kyu> 07well the 5 flash thing is to allow them time to adjust
<Kyu> 07since each isn't as powerful as the final
<Irish_Pony> PHYSICS!
<FlaschenJoe11> Is this just fantasy?
<drf|laptop> 03right
<drf|laptop> 03it still blinds you though
<drf|laptop> 03especially if you take more than one picture
<drf|laptop> 03that, and it makes it take longer
<Kyu> 07the more sudden a bright flash, the more it hurts
<ponibas> oh please don't type out Bohemian Rhapsody
<gold> .......... *sigh* i forgot what day it is -____-
<drf|laptop> 03anyone here used Olympus cameras?
<drf|laptop> 03what pissed me off about those
<gold> -____- *
<drf|laptop> 03is the fact that even though the shutter speed was fine
<Nyx> Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
<drf|laptop> 03it would take like 10 entire seconds from the time you pressed the shuter button
<drf|laptop> 03until it saves the pitcure
<drf|laptop> 03*picture
<drf|laptop> 03so meanwhile people are standing there like HURRY UP
<Pinkies4thWall> HAX
<FlaschenJoe11> Open your eyes, look up to the sky and see
<BlueFlare> 02hurr, you should watch that product demo drf
<drf|laptop> 03and if you want to take a few pictures, it takes FOREVER
<Kyu> 07that just means it has a crap buffer lol
<drf|laptop> 03my Sony is just like snap, snap, snap
<Eddmario> I'm just a poor colt
<killerpony7733> Avoid giant laser easier said the done
<drf|laptop> 03buffer? o.o
<JRP2234[Web]> no shit
<killerpony7733> then*
<Kyu> 07basically ram for a camera
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Nyx> I get no sympothy
<drf|laptop> 03also, what's a "raw" image, just like uncompressed?
<gold> star fox = YES!!!!
<Kyu> 07completely uncompressed, yeah
<drf|laptop> 03how's it different from PNG then?
<FlaschenJoe11> because I'm easy come, easy go. Little high, little low
<drf|laptop> 03I'd love cameras that use PNG xD
<Kyu> 07much bigger
<Irish_Pony> ded
<drf|laptop> 03PNG is uncompressed...
<junh1024-XD> data straight off the sensor
<drf|laptop> 03at least in MS Paint
<CriticKitten> You failed the mission
<CriticKitten> :|
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Alister[S]> Mass Effect 3 : Gears of war 4 with minor rpg elements
<Kyu> 07it incoporates more data from the camera
<drf|laptop> 03OK this may sound like a dumb question
<junh1024-XD> RAW has more data than PNG iirc
<drf|laptop> 03but if you leave the shutter open for a few seconds, you know how it takes a few seconds to "process" your shot?
<drf|laptop> 03is that like, compacting the image or
<drf|laptop> 03what'
<CriticKitten> No, you're thinking of Dead Space 3
<drf|laptop> 03and if you save it as raw, does it not take as long?
<Eddmario> Gears of War: Ratchet and Clank with minor Halo elements
<JRP2234[Web]> ded
<Irish_Pony> XD
<junh1024-XD> ye
<drf|laptop> 03so raw would save isnt\antly?
<drf|laptop> 03*instantly
<junh1024-XD> maybe
<Kyu> 07raw would take up more of the buffer
<CriticKitten> Ratchet and Clank: video game with minor interactivity elements
<Eddmario> Anywhere the wind blooooooooooooooooows
<ponibas> like a rogue
<Kyu> 07you only ever shoot in raw if you expect a hell of a lot of post processing
<drf|laptop> 03see this is foreign to me
<drf|laptop> 03all cameras I've ever used have saved as JPG
<drf|laptop> 03even my dad's fancy DSLR
<gold> HOLD IT! why is there a pokemon center in new bark town o_o'
<drf|laptop> 03also BlueFlare, what product demo, I donj't see one
<drf|laptop> 03-j
<junh1024-XD> or want to have lots of control over the photo afterwards
<Kyu> 07your dad's should shoot in raw
<drf|laptop> 03control like what junh1024-XD?
<drf|laptop> 03well it might, he doesn't have it set as such
<drf|laptop> 03he also has his set to 4x6
<drf|laptop> 03and not 4:3
<drf|laptop> 03which is so annoying
<Kyu> 07...
<Kyu> 07why
<drf|laptop> 03why at which
<Kyu> 074:6
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03because he's stupid
*drf|laptop runs
<Eddmario> Isn't New Bark Town where you start in gold, silver, and crystal? If so, I'm pretty sure there's no Pokemon Center there
<drf|laptop> 034:3 is pretty much the accepted ratio for digital picturesz, right?
<drf|laptop> 03-z
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 SHOOT STUFF IN 1080P
<drf|laptop> 03but his are all in 4x6-ratio
<owlicious> You usually sleep at Ash's mom's house
<gold> but i see one....
<owlicious> that regenerates HP
<Nyx> gold: Screen cap?
<Eddmario> gold: screen cap?
<gold> "ash" OBJECTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<ponibas> Sumica I think I saw Harrison Jones!!
<Irish_Pony> This actually got a 10/10 on Game Informer :P
<killerpony7733> Inb4 secret but fun
<Eddmario> Wait, when did the stream switch from Mass Errect to Transformers?
<gold> what's sceen cap?
<drf|laptop> 03I can find out what model camera he has, it's a Nikon is all I know
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Game looks fun. Too bad EA ruined it for me.
<Kyu> 07lol
<Nyx> gold: See the button on your computer that says "print screen"
<Eddmario> gold: or the one that says "prt sc"? PRESS IT!
<drf|laptop> 03woah what
<ponibas> I need to get this... Soon™
<drf|laptop> 03that Canon you linked me to uses AA's BlueFlare?
<Alister[S]> Stop blaming EA only. Bioware stuck their heard up their own asses anyway
<drf|laptop> 03I love those, because I hate rechargables
<drf|laptop> 03they die on you and you're SOL
<drf|laptop> 03whereas I can just walk into any store, buy some AAs and be good
<CriticKitten> Why are you a robot?

<Nyx> doctors, as in "take 2 of these and call me in the morning"
<Kyu> 07well yeah, in point and shoots lol
<Irish_Pony> :D
<drf|laptop> 03pretty much all P&S's now use proprietary rechargables :|
<drf|laptop> 03there's only like 17 of them on newegg that don't anymore LOL

<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: More or less. My memory is shot these days. I can only seem to remember select things. Thought I might have been sick but Doc says I just have too much to keep in check. So he said not to stress everything and I should find myself more apt at remembering things.
*BlueFlare runs
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: I would :P
<panda> Shizuka stay up another 45 minutes?
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Mr. sandman glompin' ya'?

<Sylandest> Iron_Edge: (\ everythings going good, hehe. just chilling
<BlueFlare> 02problem is, due to the bigger size of CMOS, most point and shoot cameras don't have CMOS
<panda> Spectrum_Rush aww :(
<Irish_Pony> ponibas: Rain does :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bed, go to Shizuka.
*Phase4 00,02hugs Shizuka
<drf|laptop> 03OK I'm confused

<panda> Nittany_Discord :)
*Rain glomps Shizuka
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Isnt the rule you can't ship Shizuka with any else besides ViVi?

<Om> MahBoi777: Now you won't ever do that nasty thing again :)

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What dod
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oops
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What do I get if I win?

<Kyu> 07the higher the number, the more noise the picture will have
<BlueFlare> 02ISO 50 or gtfo
<drf|laptop> 03how come with film, the actual film determines the ISO
*BlueFlare runs
<drf|laptop> 03opposed to digital

<drf|laptop> 03I remember when 800 film first came out, people ewre like OMG BETTER FILM
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Kyu> 07because that's how sensitive the film is to light
<panda> Ponies47 it wont go through the screen
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.

<panda> Irish_Pony hehe i am pretty moe ^-^
<Spectrum_Rush> panda: ;)
<Cipher> 0,14SPHESS MARINE time?
<panda> Ninjazz Spectrum_Rush stop it xD
<Ninjazz> FOR THE EMPRAH!'
<TOY_PON3> Damn you BBQ now I gotta watch it On Demand for sure now
<Irish_Pony> Cipher: Did somepony say marines?!
<JRP2234[Web]> SuperBrony64:
<Spectrum_Rush> FOR RARITY
<Ponies47> FOR MANE 6!
*MahBoi777 pats TOY_PON3 on the back
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01panda: Must be a last name to be an anagram of "Brony."
<Spectrum_Rush> FOR LUNA!!!
<Cipher> 0,14dat Scottish accent
<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: But as for the krogan female. She survived throughout the entire game for me even at the very end when most other side characters died from things such as me being too brutish or too leniant. Meh..all in all it was a great game. The ME3 series was pretty good.
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: At least I ate like a king :(
<panda> Nittany_Discord no, its my first name :)
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: it is a first name
<Rain> dat very heavy scottish accent
<panda> Spectrum_Rush shush :)
<Om> panda: is it Rony B?
<Spectrum_Rush> :p
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: that's all that really matters :D
<panda> Om xD
<panda> Om no....
<Om> panda: Liar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Iron_Edge: Even the ending didn't ruin it for you?
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: Indeed, plus the finale was kinda spoiled for me anyways just wanted to see the whole thing for myself
<panda> Om that would be pretty cool though..
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: I have no idea whats wrong with the ending :P
<Om> panda: I dun like this game :I
<Cipher> 0,14you know I should take a shot everytime I hear kvetching about the ME3 ending XD
<Ponies47> BRB
*Ninjazz is suddenly reminded of Art of the Dress
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fanboy butthurt.
<TOY_PON3> Mass Effect 3's ending is still better than Halo 2's ending
<Irish_Pony> Cipher: can I join?
<Wrek> 05i know 2 swedish bronies that one had changed his name to fluttershy and someone else that changed their middle name to brony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's all I know.
<MahBoi777> Lol Ninjazz
<Irish_Pony> Wrek: o_o
<TOY_PON3> Wrek: That's a bit extreme
<panda> Om im just trying to cure nitts boredom
<panda> Nittany_Discord you dont give up do you? :(
<Om> panda: Well go get it changed to his next guess
<Cipher> 0,14well, as long as I have one kidney, I should be ok >.>
<Spectrum_Rush> there was an ending to ME3?... all i remember is an explosion and then i whitedout and cant remember
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: well...I mean in truth it was kind of a let down for someone of "Shepards " Stats. But I mean up until certain parts of the end were it started making huge plot holes to leave room for an ME4 obvious release. It was pretty legit.
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: Epic
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek: thats really interesting bronies you found
<Irish_Pony> Are we searching for Luna???
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It would be funny if ME4 was in development.
<MahBoi777> to the moooooooon
<panda> Om, thats a horrible idea ^-^
<Om> panda: And yet...
<Ponies47> BACK! :P
<panda> Om yes?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe EA did ruin the ending forcing Bioware to leave it open for a sequel.
<Wrek> 05trying to remember halo 2's ending
<Wrek> 05oh right cliffhanger
<killerpony7733> panda: boryn?
<Iron_Edge> Cipher: Saxy...does it hurt or anything? Like can you still do everything regularly and there are no like -1 kidney issues?
<Ponies47> Ohai Wrek :P
<Om> panda: You gunna do it anyway
<TOY_PON3> exactly
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Halo 2 is still best Halo
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Theyre making another Gears of War :P
<panda> killerpony7733 hehehehe no
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: That's kinda what killed it for me.
<panda> Om nope :)
<Wrek> 05i enjoyed halo 1 more than halo 2
<Wrek> 05then came the 360
<Wrek> 05so i couldnt finish the trilogy
<Om> panda: Pleas :(
<Wrek> 05oh well
<TOY_PON3> at least ME3's ending wasn't like The Sopranos ending..
<Ponies47> Never played Halo. I has PS3 ^_^ Well it's my brothers :s
<panda> Om no xD
*TOY_PON3 cringes at thought
<Irish_Pony> Wrek: well better get ready for Halo 4 :S
<Cipher> 0,14well to my understanding, having one kidney means you can't drink as much alcohol
<MahBoi777> I love Halo
<TOY_PON3> Shepard, I... THE END
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Halo 2 had a bad ending since Microsoft was so greedy
*Om hugs panda "PLEAAAAAAAAAAASE!?"
<panda> Om no!
<drf|laptop> 03http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/video-game-memes-dont-ever-show-me-this-again.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What big companies aren't greedy?
<Irish_Pony> Om: what are you doing to panda ?
<TOY_PON3> Valve?
*Om runs off crying
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: valve
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Valve kinda is greedy
<Cipher> 0,14actually, Halo 2's ending was because Bungie ran out od time
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: Leaving signs around like the very ending of ME3 with the ship and what not. It's just kinda a kick in the nads really.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Valve is a tinge.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TF2 Keys.... just saying
<Cipher> 0,14Halo 2 and 3 was supposed to be one game
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^^^
<Om> Irish_Pony: I forget, so I figured it must have been something improtant
<Wrek> 05valve are greedy in a sense
<Spectrum_Rush> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: agreed
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, but you dont have to buy keys
<Wrek> 05but not muc habove accepted greedy
<Irish_Pony> Om: =_(\
<Phase4> 00,02and Not buying them doesnt exactly ruin th egame
<Phase4> 00,02the '
<Wrek> 05and sicne they arent milking say half life
<panda> Irish_Pony im playing a guessing game with nitt and he has to guess my name, and om wants me to change my name to his next guess xD
<Cipher> 0,14thing is, Bungie hit their deadline during development so they had to cut what became Halo 3 as their own game
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: still the option of it is kinda greedy, and ppl now buy keys for stuff like strange items
<Wrek> 05the yare on pretty good terms with atleast me
*TOY_PON3 drinks a nice cold Dr. Pepper Cherry
<TOY_PON3> Mmmm.. :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> the More put into a game the better :)
<drf|laptop> 03http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/video-game-memes-i-think-i-did-this-part-wrong.png
<Wrek> 05im really looking forward to bungies new IP. i hope it seeks back to their roots with fantastic story elements.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: I bucking love the Mantis <3 that was my best friend through the entire game. One pop in the old brain bucket.
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, but thats from the people who want to waste money on stuff like that
<Dark_Horst> IP?
<Wrek> 05and hopefulyl they wont preassure themselves with deadlines havign to cut and stuff
<Cipher> 0,14same, the rumor is that it might be a Marathon reboot
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, and it goes into valve's coffers so they can work on hl2e3
<TOY_PON3> Anyone pre-ordering Halo 4?
<Chimera> niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
<Cipher> 0,14me
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Bungie's game is a MMO, and with the past of making halos its going to rock =D
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<TOY_PON3> Cipher: /)
<Cipher> 0,14(\ TOY_PON3
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: I am
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: /)
<Wrek> 05i dont midn tf2's minitransactions. they arent too expensive. much goes under a buck even half a buck
<Wrek> 05some goes higher but meh
<Cipher> 0,14actually, legal documents from the partnership between Bungie and Activision are out
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: (\\
<TOY_PON3> when that game comes out, I won't have a life till I finish it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How long until Bungie becomes a CoD dev?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: When the sun burns out
<Ponies47> Read a book! Read book! Read a mother (squee) Book! :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's the fate of every Activision-owned publisher that doesn't get shut down.
<Cipher> 0,14given that it's supposed to be a ten-year partnership, it might be likely
<TOY_PON3> Ponies47: Book? What is a book?
<Cipher> 0,14Bungie has a good track record though
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: Is TF2 working for you? I keep getting server connection errors. And "Game not available" do you know of any maitenece that might be going on? Or am I experiencing technology at its trolliest?
<MahBoi777> Bungie ftw
<Ponies47> TOY_PON3: IDK! :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bioware had a good track record before joining EA.
<ComraDerpy> activision ftw
<TOY_PON3> Ponies47: They should boring ._.
<Pinkies4thWall> Games ftw
<TOY_PON3> activision...ha!
<Wrek> 05well tf2 is up to something
<Shamroc> Iron_Edge: might have somthing to do with the update they might be bringing monday
<Pinkies4thWall> ded
<Wrek> 05with the mystery items
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Halo 4 is going to be a lore fest =D
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: I agree with you on that fully.
<Firelight> Back showing my non-brony brother The Canterlot Wedding episode.. Let's just say he is now regreting he hated us bronies XD
<Wrek> 05i definetly smell a new content patch
<Shamroc> Wrek: people sayin meet the pyro monday
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision could ruin Bungie and turn them into a CoD dev.
<Ponies47> TOY_PON3: I see.
<ComraDerpy> activision to me means something most likely from ID
<gold> !!
<Wrek> 05maybe they are fuckign about prepping the game before patch
<TOY_PON3> Oh shiiit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't underestimate publisher greed.
<JRP2234[Web]> sumica ranting is fun
<Cipher> 0,14eenope

<Ponies47> ya da da da da da! :P
<Wrek> 05TOY_PON3: not anytime soon
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TOY_PON3: Valve cant count to three silly
<Wrek> 05with tf2 being so profitable
<Pinkies4thWall> TOY_PON3: :O O MI GOD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<TOY_PON3> Wrek: Maybe when I am dead
<Wrek> 05releasing an ew title would seem like a bad move becasue it would move the majority of the players to tf3 instead.
<Iron_Edge> TOY_PON3: Don't fix it if it ain't broke.
<Spectrum_Rush> valve cant count to 3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<Pinkies4thWall> /) Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Wrek> 05henceforth drop the item sales
<Wrek> 05BUT
<panda> Wait a tf3????
<Ponies47> I haven't even played TF2 yet. I hate my computer so much :|
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> does anyone play tf2 on xbox 360 anymore or did it die out?
<TOY_PON3> They can, Half Life 2 Episode 3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Pinkies4thWall: (\
<ComraDerpy> if i even had a pc... typing this on ps3 and stream works fine :) you know what thats like, a box to type in a box...
<Iron_Edge> Ponies47: Why cant you play? Compatability issues?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol Sumica
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They would move everything to TF3.
<Wrek> 05maybe after valve release left 4 half team portal 4 we may see a tf3
<Pinkies4thWall> I'd have to get the orange box to play TF2. it doesn't work on my computer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I don't see why a TF3 is needed.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek: O_o
<TOY_PON3> Wrek: Maybe yes
<Firelight> hm..
<Ponies47> Iron_Edge: My computer is 9 years old. Just about ready to die. Saving for a new one at the moment
<TOY_PON3> Nittany_Discord: I just was asking you know curiousity
<Shamroc> oh yeah Wrek i heard thats coming in 2040...onlu 28 more years

<TOY_PON3> just buy TF2 on computer, you got mods and everything
<Pinkies4thWall> Wrek: TF2 wont work properly on my laptop.
<Iron_Edge> Ponies47: -lol well aside from age what is preventing you from downloading TF2?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i want to see a new Orange box 2
<Firelight> I had to get a new laptop charge + a new bettery.

<JRP2234[Web]> NVIDIA GeForce GT 540M with 2gb vram
<Wrek> 05plus all the cuts from steam sales
<Iron_Edge> Ponies47: -lol maybe try shutting down some useless process from your task manager. There are certain programs that will remain active even if there not actively being used. If these types of programs stay ipen long enough they will slow down your PC.
<Irish_Pony> Wrek: and the tf2 store

<Wrek> 05have you tried a separate keyboard and does the issues stay then?
<Iron_Edge> Pinkies4thWall: Do you have a mouse with a wheel? You can swap weps with that. versus using the keyboard. Personally I find it more effective anyways.
<TOY_PON3> Sumica: They know you better than you know yourself :P
<Pinkies4thWall> hmm. i need to try that
<JRP2234[Web]> inthis case i can not g

<TOY_PON3> Hmmm
<Sumica> 00,10you must have been moving fast then
<sub06905> TOY_PON3: not quite yet, we need to add a fruit to our names :3
<cher3ry> not really, I was under 100 by that point.
<TOY_PON3> You just gave me an idea
*Ponies47 Looks at his pony pictures
<cher3ry> Although my reentry from Minmus tends to be somewhat harrowing anyway, I was trying a couple things to avoid that and they seemed to work
<B3RRY_PON3> =D
<orange_sub06905> ....
<cher3ry> there's just something about a freefall from 46,000 km high (and no terminal velocity issues until the last 60 km of that) that just lends itself to screaming like a Kerbal astronaut
<Ponies47> It ain't gonna work guys. Remeber I took these *Holds out pillz*
*B3RRY_PON3 snatches pillz and runs away
<cher3ry> ponies47 hate to tell you this, man, but, I'm a pharmacist in training. and those, those are placebos.
<orange_sub06905> Some one get Louis, Ponies47 has PEELZ!
<B3RRY_PON3> Placebo... :'(
*B3RRY_PON3 goes in depressed state
<Ponies47> I already took em so I'm fine :)
*Ponies47 Yawns
<cher3ry> actually, fun fact, it's almost impossible to tell a placebo from the real thing, except by a thorough chemical analysis. Most studies that use them are double-blind, so the pills have to be similar enough to the real thing to fool doctors and nurses.
*orange_sub06905 doesnt know what else makes Ponies47 snap
<Ponies47> :)
<B3RRY_PON3> I miss Placebo. Why did you have to get banned you basterd?! D:
<Ponies47> Ok it's 4:00 AM sleepy time. Night night everypony :)

<sub06905> xxMoopyxx: dont worry it only plays when Sumica is aboot to end the stream
<Spell-of-Gaming> But Twilight and deviantART are the worst combination.
<xxMoopyxx> good

<RainBowJack> i just cant get the song BBBFF out of my head
<sub06905> My big brother best friend forever, like two peas in a pod we did everything together
<RainBowJack> he tought me how to flie a kite
<XAX> Aaaaaaand im back again. Hai guize :3
<xxMoopyxx> Omg i can still hear it in my head and it won't go away oh jesus christ help me
<Spell-of-Gaming> BBBFF is probably the most HNNNNG-inducing song in FiM
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm bored.
<XAX> BBBFF was the first twilight song since... her part in At the gala?
<XAX> Am I right?
<XAX> Or am I mistaken.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Am I the only one who thinks that Microsoft was being a douchebag for selling their software than distributing it by punchcards?
<RainBowJack> i think so
<MasterBoss43> XAX I think you are mistaking there....
*scottish-geeky hugs RainBowJack
<XAX> MasterBoss43: My mind refuses to tell me another song sung by Twilight
<xxMoopyxx> i like the G4 intro cause G4 is way better then freakin G1 intro with the freakin crapy stinky sea ponies
<scottish-geeky> nite evry pony
<RainBowJack> when Twilight sang the BBBFF Twilight was 20% cooler in my BOOK
<XAX> >crappy sea ponies
<Spell-of-Gaming> The G1 intro isn't Seaponies.
<MasterBoss43> XAX Ok, i will tell.
<XAX> Oh you:
<xxMoopyxx> yes it was
<Spell-of-Gaming> Actually, the G4 intro is loosely based on the G1 intro. Even the composing sounds almost alike.
<xxMoopyxx> Hmmmmmm
<Magical_pablez94> xxMoopyxx: o god.
<xxMoopyxx> what
<Spell-of-Gaming> I admit, G1 isn't bad... but it went downhill when the supposed G2 arrived.
<xxMoopyxx> hey can they turn this into a movie?
<sub06905> G3.5
<MasterBoss43> XAX She is in many songs, like winter wrap up and the night gala. Some other songs too.
<XAX> right.
<xxMoopyxx> i think i like the rainbow dash gala song
<JRP2234[Web]> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<MasterBoss43> But your right XAX, her first own song is BBBFF.
<xxMoopyxx> eeyup
<XAX> MasterBoss43: What I was saying, is that BBBFF was her first song in quite a few episodes
<dalekkahn> IMMORTAL FTW
<Spell-of-Gaming> http://i.imgur.com/eqBlM.jpg

<MasterBoss43> XAX Then i'm sorry that i didn't see the Her first. B*tch be gone now.

<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, all 3 AND the dlc
<flutterchu> im always depressed and all people do is to tell me to shut the fuck up *thinks about suicide but then thinks of the ponies*
<TOY_PON32> ...
<somepony> FairysHuff: xD
<TOY_PON32> Phase4: it's crazy right?!
<Phase4> 00,02TOY_PON32, its insane
<Phase4> 00,02but they did it
<Phase4> 00,02and thus i own dx:hr
<FairysHuff> flutterchu: Your not alone. I'm 32 and have been depressed since childhood, on meds for 12 years and finally got diagnosed with Aspergers last year. I now take one day at a time.
<d3rb> flutterchu: these guys take use their time to stream so some take offence to people complaining about the stream being boring
<TOY_PON32> I wanna buy it so bad
<d3rb> dont take it too personaly flutterchu
<TOY_PON32> >3<
<Phase4> 00,02one sec i'ma try something
<FairysHuff> flutterchu: Just do what I do if theres something streaming I'm not interested in. Pause the stream.
<flutterchu> okay lets just be a happy server think of the ponies
<d3rb> :)
<Magical_pablez94> nope
<Magical_pablez94> yep nope
<flutterchu> exept twilight
<FairysHuff> Oops, stream lag... weird
<TOY_PON32> truth of the matter flutterchu Wrek doesn't take too kindly to complainers. Well I don't think any mod does tbh ._.
*alexxm hugs flutterchu
<flutterchu> alexxm: i dont appreciate any happy things unless i earn them by slavory
<TOY_PON32> And here's something completely different!
*TOY_PON32 dances
<FairysHuff> I don't enjoy much of what is streamed as it's mostly TF2 and KPS or whatever it's called. Neither of which I have any interest in. But instead of complaining I just pause the stream and chat with people instead. Easier and much less drama. <--- hates drama
<WallDives> ^
<FairysHuff> DeusEx however I enjoy. So thats staying on
<Lil_B> vote for me and I'll stream Lotus III XD
<Wrek> 05FairysHuff: yeah most weekday streams are games and art. those that tend to stream series havent been on too much.
<TOY_PON32> I say stream cute fluffy kittens! :P
<alexxm> i usaully give most things at are streamed a chance
<BrOnyxia> hey thrtr
<Wrek> 05will bunnies suffice?
<FairysHuff> Wrek: I don't mind it I just wish there was more variation in the streams. Doesn't always have to be Tf2 yah know. So I appreciate the Deus Ex stream now
<Wrek> 05[13:59] Johan Tegelsten (Wrek): claims of suicidal tendencies today so far: 3
<FairysHuff> Lil_B: Whats Lotus 3?
<Wrek> 05http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/Angelic-Fluttershy-310158753
<alexxm> hey BrOnyxia hows your day been
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Phase4> 00,02email about washing out soda cans
<Phase4> 00,02aparently sugar attracts gnats
<BrOnyxia> alexxm: just started and yours?
<Wrek> 05hope the bunnies lightens the mood ^^
<Wrek> 05need to draw more daaw
<Kandarihu> That beep sounds familiar.
<alexxm> good so far BrOnyxia
<Phase4> 00,02you guys need to read these emails
<FairysHuff> Wrek: OH! You finished it? YAY! ^_^ *Instant desktop wallpaper* If thats ok?
<Phase4> 00,02excelent writing
<BrOnyxia> alexxm: :D
<TOY_PON32> If there is something no very interested on stream I do one of three things. 1. Ignore stream and focus on chat. 2. Do something else like watch TV, play games, or surf the web. Or 3. Just get off completely then get on later. It works perfectly.
<TOY_PON32> Sorry wall o text..
<SirGanjalf> What I've learned from first DeusEx: Read every e-mail.
<Kandarihu> Shareware games are a security risk?
<flutterchu> dear princess celestia i learned that i still want to be an emo
<Wrek> 05everythign is a security risk nowadays
<TOY_PON32> True
<BrOnyxia> haha 0.4 secs
<FairysHuff> I buy games on a whim far too much. I blow so much money on them and then hardly play them. Dungeon Defenders being an example. Now I want to buy Krater? GET A GRIP FAIRYSHUFF! Self control >_<
<TOY_PON32> O.o
<TOY_PON32> Im poor so I hardly buy any games.
<Wrek> 05FairysHuff: i do the same but with tf2 keys...
<Wrek> 05also flutterchu http://wreky.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d4inzuh
<FairysHuff> Wrek: heheh ^_^ Thankfully I stopped playing Tf2 before that stuff was implemented
<TOY_PON32> Wrek: are you interested in some free crates?
<Wrek> 05its one of the few games i play on a regular basis nowadays
<dutchbrony> hi people
<Lil_B> FairysHuff wow, I buy like a miximum of 2 games per year, nopt including smoll peunuts like Binding of Isaac or Humble bundles
<FairysHuff> TOY_PON32: I am also poor which makes my on whim game purchasing that much worse. O_o
<TOY_PON32> That sucks FairysHuff
<Wrek> 05hi dutchbrony
<flutterchu> Wrek: *smiles*laugs* oh fuck you
<FairysHuff> *Smack self hard* Self control dammit >_< You don't need Krater!
<TOY_PON32> And kick. No? Ok
<Wrek> 05aint the cheerful mood eh?
<TOY_PON32> Yeah you are
<LochNessCheez> hello everypony
<Wrek> 05hi LochNessCheez
<TOY_PON32> But like I was going to ask you Wrek are you interested in some free crates?
<FairysHuff> LochNessCheez: Holla
<Lil_B> FairysHuff what is Krater anyway?
<Wrek> 05TOY_PON32: ant series 30?
<Wrek> 05any*
<TOY_PON32> Wrek: I'll have to check
<Lil_B> Wrek do you collect crates in TF2?
<TOY_PON32> I'll let you know though
<flutterchu> since I would LOVE to be an emo http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/7dc2aad571160dd2e3437989a994c74b/29095%20-%20artist%3Amihaaaa%20cuttershy%20emo%20emoshy%20fluttershy%20hi-rez.png
<FairysHuff> Lil_B: It's from the makers of War of Roses (Fat Shark) it's a top down action rpg set in post apocalyptic sweden.... SWEDEN! AT LAST! VARIATION! ^_^ Sick of the US.
<BrOnyxia> flutterchu: :o
<TOY_PON32> I got like 5 or 6 crates. Damn..
<Wrek> 05FairysHuff: and the character design is wonky as hell too
<FairysHuff> Lil_B: You can find it on steam
<flutterchu> BrOnyxia: *grins*
<FairysHuff> Wrek: Yup. All wearing masks. Bet the development team thanked the gods for that design decision ^_^
<Lil_B> FairysHuff I want a game centered in a old part of an Modern German Tow :/
<TOY_PON32> still trying to get three refined metals to make a bonk boy mask for scout
<flutterchu> http://e621.net/data/45/ef/45efeb12bf8117ae648cd016be4ff2a1.jpg?1303655787
<TOY_PON32> I have one just two more to go
<diddutz> anyone noticed the TF2 update with the advanced MVP statistics?
<FairysHuff> Anyone elses stream keep lagging?
<LochNessCheez> ayup
<BrOnyxia> i used to buy items for tf2 too... its not a good thing to do i understood that
<TOY_PON32> diddutz: Yea weird
<FairysHuff> Roughly every five seconds it buffers the stream for me.
<LochNessCheez> same here
<TOY_PON32> I usually buy few hats and weapons. Whatever is in sale
<TOY_PON32> is on*
<Wrek> 05i only buy mods for my strange items
<BrOnyxia> tho i dont get how steam workshop works
<TOY_PON32> ^
<Wrek> 05it varies
<FairysHuff> BrOnyxia: Fairys... it's all driven by fairys
<Wrek> 05for isntance for skyrim if you sub to a mod and rate it it will dowinload and isntall directly on your skyrim. easy and simple.
<Wrek> 05on tf2. faving and rating a mod or item jsut increases its chacnes to get in game
<TOY_PON32> Still waiting for Dawnguard..
<Lil_B> hey got new music, Wind Waker Soundtrack and the Metroid Prime and Fusion Soundtrack :D
<BrOnyxia> hm cool

<TOY_PON32> Can't see stream cause im on mobile but im sure it's good
<FairysHuff> We need more games set in places other than the US. Like say Nepal.
<BrOnyxia> Lil_B: i see.. i have played metroi prime hunters on DS ;o.. its kinda nice
<FairysHuff> Or poland
<TOY_PON32> Too many Merican games I guess
<FairysHuff> TOY_PON32: Yeh.
<Kandarihu> Oh, did I miss the end of the cutscene?
<FairysHuff> TOY_PON32: I like variation.

<Phase4> 00,02because i cant stand being a dick
<Phase4> 00,02so as non-lethal as posible and free the hostages
<TOY_PON32> Phase4: Of what game? Sorry cant see stream atm
<Lil_B> your wish is her command ... he?
<Phase4> 00,02dx:hr
<Kandarihu> I like that.
<TOY_PON32> Oh ok
<FairysHuff> F**k it. I am a consumer whore. I'm buying krater special pack now. >_<
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, i'm not sure
<FairysHuff> Someone hit me hard.
<alexxm> TOY_PON32 desus ex human revoultion
<LochNessCheez> same, I can never get myself to be evil in games
<TOY_PON32> No one hit FairysHuff plz
<FairysHuff> TOY_PON32: But... but I deserve it ~_~
<Lil_B> FairysHuff I don't always buy games, but when i do, I take the Special Edition
*d3rb taps FairysHuff
<TOY_PON32> No you don't
<TOY_PON32> Lil_B: Exactamundo
<FairysHuff> Lil_B: Depends on the special edition. If it's £60 then no... not a chance ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02i like the options here
<Phase4> 00,02"i like em" "i dont like em" "shut up and stop asking questions"
<TOY_PON32> haha
<Lil_B> FairysHuff yes, my Cut-off prize is 70€, my last 3 big games were Skywars Sword, ANOO 2070 and Port Royale 3 and oll these Special Editions were under 60€
<alexxm> so what one you going to do then
<FairysHuff> Phase4: I always say I like em. ^_^ Just because I would love to have them myself
<LochNessCheez> I just realised I was wearing shades the entire time O.o
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, i've thought about it and am honestly not sure wether i'd want augs
<TOY_PON32> I put my sun glasses at night
<FairysHuff> LochNessCheez: I wear presciption sunglasses all the time. Sensitive eyes. Even at night
<Lil_B> I would never buy something like Skyrim or Diabolo 3 Special Edition for 199 or whatever
<TOY_PON32> I wear. It's I wear Toy..
<Phase4> 00,02'neural enhancments' sure, but lobbing of limbs? yeah, no
<FairysHuff> Phase4: I'm all for augs myself. So long as it was a complete body replacement like in Ghost in the Shell.
<TOY_PON32> Lil_B: I would
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<cher3ry> yeah, well, next step after neural enhancements is neural hacking
<LochNessCheez> I was watching some music videos and thought shades would be appropriate. forgot to take them off
<FairysHuff> Yeh thats one thing I would avoid getting. Be permanently in autistic mode ala GotS
<Wrek> 05id rather wait for the nano augs
<TOY_PON32> I was watching ponies and thought swag would be appropriate. Forgot to turn it off
<Phase4> 00,02jensen's voice somewhat disturbs me
<LochNessCheez> ikr
<FairysHuff> Wrek: That would be nice but the main reason I want full body replacement is to change gender.
<FairysHuff> Wrek: Dunno if nano tech would be advanced enough for that
<TOY_PON32> Phase4: Why's that?
<LochNessCheez> I think it might be a little too deep
<FairysHuff> Well just bought Krater... And I feel dirty and ashamed. ~_~ I'm a bad bad pony.
<Wrek> 05FairysHuff: play the first deus ex ;3 its all about the nano augs
<cher3ry> considering that they can do a lot of it today...
<Phase4> 00,02TOY_PON32, it just sounds off
<FairysHuff> Wrek: I've played it 7 times ^_^
<TOY_PON32> Phase4: D=
<alexxm> he just sounds so emontionless
<TOY_PON32> Like a dead man..
<FairysHuff> Wrek: I have the original boxed version from release and the steam version
<LochNessCheez> well, he did nearly die
<Wrek> 05well he's trying to do a JC denton voice.
<LochNessCheez> he pretty much did die
<TOY_PON32> Woah
<FairysHuff> "war... war never changes..." ANyone remember the rest of that quote? ^_^
<LochNessCheez> final fantasy XXVI?
<cher3ry> You know they'll make one
<Ascendant> So Xeli
<Ascendant> I got Skyrim
<alexxm> inb4 thats the actual final fantasy 26 cover
<TOY_PON32> ^
<d3rb> :d
<Wrek> 05men do somethin somethin
<diddutz> FairysHuff: allthou i use that quote i'm not really sure where if comes from ^^
<Phase4> 00,02what is it, 2080?
<Phase4> 00,02and they still use scsi adapters
<Wrek> 052042 or something
<Phase4> 00,02heck, we dont use them now
<cher3ry> 2080 and they're only up to Final Fantasy 26?
<FairysHuff> diddutz: It can be traced to two games. Fallout3 intro and Metal Gear 4
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<cher3ry> 2042, same question? :D
<FairysHuff> I just don't remember the full quote.
<Wrek> 05Phase4: did you follow the email on your comp and finish the secrent sniff down?
<TOY_PON32> Google it
<MadSurge> Bonjour Bronystate! :D
<diddutz> FairysHuff: could also suit the CoD singleplayer ...

<FairysHuff> Wrek: I'm more of a sci-fi shooter fan. If I'm going to shoot a gun I want it to be cool and interesting. Like the gun that shoots spiders in Unreal 2
<TOY_PON32> Oh btw when did all the mods get their own OC desktop ponies?
<Ray> 02Now, I'll play some CS

<Kandarihu> I'm guessing it started with Wrek.
<diddutz> FairysHuff: So you should like HL2 and Portal a lot?
<MadSurge> FairysHuff: even Doom and Serious Sam have interesting guns :D
<TOY_PON32> Wrek: Oh cool I just wanted to know that's all

<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<MadSurge> Wrek: Oh, the Alien vs Predator game? :D
<Espeon> Whee
<Wrek> 05MadSurge: its not an AvP game
<MadSurge> Wrek: I know, but the protagonist looks like a Predator and the main enemies look like Aliens. It looked like a fun game
<Wrek> 05its an awesomely fun game
<Wrek> 05a little short
<Wrek> 05extremly unforgiving
<Kandarihu> It requires a fairly strong temperment. Without one, it can get very frustrating.
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
<alexxm> hey Sylandest i'm good how about you
<LochNessCheez> just fine
<Ethereal> Morning, Sylandest
<Sylandest> alexxm: doing good, hehe, just hanging out for a little while before i head out for the day
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: I made it through the Land of the Livid Dead, I think I can take Abuse :D
<alexxm> Wrek was abuse meant to be an aliens game but they couldn't get the rights
<Sylandest> hwowdy, Ethereal!
<Ethereal> Nice to see you all again
<Kandarihu> MadSurge: that's the spirit
<Wrek> 05alexxm: henceforth its not an AvP game
<Sylandest> good to see you too, Ethereal :)
<Ethereal> :D
<Wrek> 05time to nap
<Wrek> 05bai
<Sylandest> night, Wrek! :)
<Ethereal> OTACON
<alexxm> bye Wrek
<Ethereal> Nini, Wrek
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: as long as they don't pull some I Wanna Be The Guy style bullshit... :D
<MadSurge> Good nap Wrek! :D
<Ethereal> It's Otacon! :3
<Sylandest> on the screen you mean, Ethereal?
<Kandarihu> That game requires an epic temperament... or at least a healthy sense of humor.
<Ethereal> Yes
<Wrek> 05MadSurge: you pull atleast 2 of those
<Wrek> 05they*
<Ethereal> Anyone here use Last FM?
<MadSurge> Wrek: two in the whole game? Not enough to piss me off :)
<Wrek> 05no 2 that were forgivable
<alexxm> the labcoat guys arms move so unnaturaly
<alexxm> chats ded
<alexxm> ded
<MadSurge> Kinda
<Ethereal> I'm here
<FairysHuff> I'm trying to get the last mb of Krater to download from steam. Hence my silence
*Sylandest is dead
<Sylandest> XD
<FairysHuff> Says download suspended.
<Sylandest> go FairysHuff go!
<Sylandest> oh noes
<FairysHuff> Only has 1mb left to go to
<Ethereal> Does anyone here use last.fm?
<alexxm> well its raining where i am
<FairysHuff> alexxm: I love rain
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: check your firewall or anything like that?
<Rain> aw shucks, FairysHuff
<LochNessCheez> it's going to be raining where I am
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: I'll just restart steam the verify files. That usually works.
<Sylandest> alexxm: we could use some rain where I am. We've been without rain so long, we're under a burn watch
<Videofreak1127[M]> So I had a huge epiphany last night about my OC. I saw him dancing and playing a sousaphone in a dream...
<Ascendant> JASF is cool though
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: good luck! :)
<Ascendant> I also got Assassin's Creed II
<Ascendant> as 1 wasn't available
<alexxm> Sylandest whats a burn watch
*Ascendant will get it tomorrow
<Sylandest> alexxm: basically, a warning implemented to ensure no one tries to set anything on fire, due to the grass and local grounds being so dry. one misplaced cigarette or match, and everything would burn
<FairysHuff> alexxm: It means they have to be careful of sudden fires.
<MadSurge> Let's jump on all furniture, who cares! :D
<alexxm> thanks Sylandest and MadSurge
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Australia? Apparently its common there
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: nay, Kentucky! :D
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Ah, just as dry I guess.
<Videofreak1127[M]> This guy sounds like Batman
<Chrysalis> oh hi phase stream
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Though I though kentucky was more humid?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> Remember kids , only you can set forestfires!
<FairysHuff> TrixieBaconMuffin: Forest fires can happen spontaneously as well if it gets too dry.
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: under normal circumstances, yeah, but it hasn't rained in almost 3 weeks. Prolly even longer. Thus the burn watch
<Ethereal> I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS. I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS. I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS. I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS
<Kandarihu> Could sprinklers be used to moisten things?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> so you never heard of smokey the bear ?
<Sylandest> TrixieBaconMuffin: I have, I lol-ed :D
<LochNessCheez> forest fires can start naturally *cough*australia*cough*
<FairysHuff> LochNessCheez: Exactly
<Sylandest> Kandarihu: we dont have sprinklers for all the fields of crops out here, lol XD
<Phase4> 00,02you guys noticed how jensens coloar rotates with his head
<FairysHuff> There are certain plants that have evolved to thrive after a forest fire they are that common.
<Sylandest> Phase4: im just now realizing it, but yes, lol
<Phase4> 00,02broken animation ftw!
<Chrysalis> Phase4 i never had that when i played
<LochNessCheez> the dead trees feed the new ones ^^
<FairysHuff> LochNessCheez: Yup.
<Phase4> 00,02i like how everyone is complaining that i let the guy get away
<Phase4> 00,02and then i find $42 in a bin
<LochNessCheez> it's not like winter wrap up where WE have to set the forest fire for the next generation of trees to grow
<FairysHuff> LochNessCheez: But there are certain plants I forget the name of in Australia that sit dormant in the earth until a forest fire. Afterwards they sprout like crazy
<Sylandest> Phase4: yay, surprise benefits! :D
<Ninjazz> Hello Everyone.

<Sylandest> Ninjazz: :D its called post-breakfast happiness. It overloads common spelling ability
<MadSurge> He's breaking the fourth wall!
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony!! :)

<FairysHuff> Sylandest: It's bad. They live on state pension they can't afford to keep giving me money. But she keeps insisting. SOmetimes I have to sneak the money BACK into her purse. ~_~
<LochNessCheez> how delayed is the stream?
*RaveBrony waves to Sylandest, LochNessCheez, Ninjazz, alexxm, and MadSurge :)

<FairysHuff> Sylandest: I'm almost completely dependant on them because I can't hold down a job. And I hate myself for being such a burden. ~_~
<Ninjazz> XD
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: I am sure you are not viewed as a burden. And there's a job out there for you somewhere, im sure :)
<RaveBrony> :D
<Ninjazz> I don't think that's how you play b-ball.
<Sylandest> come on, Phase4!
<MegaMoonShine> It's been good alexxm
<Phase4> 00,02this city has well dressed hobos
<Kandarihu> So does Athens
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: I have been in and out of employment over the past 12 years. Never holding a job for long. Finally tired of this I went to get some help. A psychologist diagnosed me with Aspergers Syndrome.
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Now everything makes sense.
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: oooh, i see. That does tend to complicate things :$
<Ninjazz> No doubt.
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Yeh... ~_~
*Sylandest hugs FairysHuff
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: you'll figure something out
<alexxm> you don't say

<Ninjazz> Animals make great pets.

<FairysHuff> Yeh, I tend to get rather attached to them though ^_^ So if any were to pass on I would take it hard.
<TrixieBaconMuffin> first day there , sing flutterwonder out loud ^^

<Ninjazz> MegaMoonShine: Hmmm?

<MegaMoonShine> LochNessCheez: :'(
<Ninjazz> I used to have a chicken as a pet.

<Phase4> 00,02RaveBrony, yup
<Spectrum_Rush> aww
<Phase4> 00,02its worth it
<RaveBrony> Oh cool :o
<RaveBrony> What about blur??
<FairysHuff> Blur is £14 on steam
<RaveBrony> Im not much on racing games, but the extra elements in it caught my interest
<RaveBrony> :P
<FairysHuff> It is good and I suck at racing games.
<LochNessCheez> I can tell you live in britain FairysHuff
<Kandarihu> So, did I miss the trick on KSP?
<FairysHuff> LochNessCheez: Oh? ^_^ What gave it away? *Cough* £ *Cough*
<alexxm> FairysHuff last time i saw it a few months ago it was still a pup
<FairysHuff> alexxm: A loving affectionate pet for an overly effectionate pony like myself. ^_^ perfect match
<Dark_Horst> neat
<FairysHuff> I would be quite happy leading a life like Fluttershys. Sadly that doesn't pay the bills or food ~_~
<LochNessCheez> did fluttershy have any scenes where she eats food?
<LochNessCheez> for some reason I can't remember any
<MegaMoonShine> LochNessCheez: I don't think so :D
<FairysHuff> LochNessCheez: Neither can I
<FairysHuff> I was too busy drooling over her ^_^
<LochNessCheez> maybe she doesn't eat?
<LochNessCheez> she feeds on kindness
<LochNessCheez> >:D
<FairysHuff> Maybe love is her sustenance
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<MegaMoonShine> Fluttershy is changeling?! :O
<Dark_Horst> and on this day it was deduced that fluttershy is a changeling
<MadSurge> Inane ghetto talk!
<LochNessCheez> yup
<somepony> lol
<FairysHuff> MegaMoonShine: Where did that come from?
<Dark_Horst> probably the nicest one you'll meet
<LochNessCheez> plot twist
<Skylands> 10yawnrawr
<Starflash> Hmm.. I wonder if I should buy this game
<MegaMoonShine> FairysHuff: Where did what? :S
<Starflash> looks pretty cool
<LochNessCheez> Season 3, episode 1: turns out they didn't wipe out all the changelings
<Dark_Horst> Starflash: you definately should
<FairysHuff> MegaMoonShine: The changling thing. I don't get the referance
<FairysHuff> *reference?
<Starflash> Wait. The guy is a sorcerer or something?
<LochNessCheez> FairysHuff: changelings feed on the love of others
<alexxm> FairysHuff the bad guys it the season 2 fianle
<LochNessCheez> I'm pretty sure
<Dark_Horst> FairysHuff: you know what a changeling is, right?
<LochNessCheez> a canterlott wedding
<Dark_Horst> dont tell me you havent seen that eoisode yet
<LochNessCheez> canterlot*
<MegaMoonShine> They gain power by turning into someone you love and feeding off of your love for them
<FairysHuff> I have been saving the season 2 finale of MLP so haven't watched it. No spoilers please ^_^
<LochNessCheez> oh
<LochNessCheez> oops :P
<MegaMoonShine> :S
<FairysHuff> hehe Not a big deal ^_^
<LochNessCheez> phew
<alexxm> sorry FairysHuff
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Tis not a big deal. I'm chill ^_^
<Ninjazz> lol
<FairysHuff> I am possibly the most relaxed pony you'll ever meet. So relaxed I may not even have a skeleton O_o
<alexxm> is that what they call it now
<FairysHuff> The only thing I tend to get upset about is when people start drama.
<MadSurge> :D PIRATES
<FairysHuff> <-- Hates people who cause drama. very stressful
<LochNessCheez> whoa, cortex command is coming to steam
*somepony drops drama bomb in chat
<alexxm> is it good LochNessCheez
<LochNessCheez> very
<alexxm> whats it about
<LochNessCheez> it's got a big modding community
<LochNessCheez> it's a 2D physics based shooter
<LochNessCheez> it's got fully destructible terrain
<LochNessCheez> etc.
<alexxm> how much is it going for
<LochNessCheez> well you can get it on non-steam
<FairysHuff> I will be glad when I can start my prescription painkillers again. 6 more days to go. ~_~ Paracetomol isn't strong enough.
<Dark_Horst> FairysHuff: what you need them for?
<LochNessCheez> does this count as advertising?
<LochNessCheez> :/
<FairysHuff> Dark_Horst: Had constant head pain and migraines for past 7 years.
<MegaMoonShine> Don't think so LochNessCheez
<FairysHuff> Pian never stops
<FairysHuff> Ever
<Dark_Horst> how'D that happen?
<FairysHuff> *pain
<LochNessCheez> it's quite expensive
<LochNessCheez> $20
<alexxm> any idea why FairysHuff
<alexxm> mind crush him Phase4
<Hat> CRUSH
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, i'm thinking about that
<Phase4> 00,02think it might work
<FairysHuff> Dark_Horst: I was at University at the time and went into a deep depression as things weren't going well. So I stopped taking my meds suddenly in a fit of self harm. Since then I've been in pain.
<MegaMoonShine> Just one little mind crush, it'll barely hurt him
<Dark_Horst> sounds nasty
<LochNessCheez> CRUSH HIM
<FairysHuff> Don't know for sure if the pain is related to my suddenly stopping my meds 7 years ago but it started at the same time.
*alexxm hugs FairysHuff
<Hat> Is this Deus Ex and should I get it
<FairysHuff> alexxm: *Cuddles* ^_^
<alexxm> crush him
<FairysHuff> It's why I sleep so much. The pain makes me very drowsy.
<Phase4> 00,02well that didnt work
<FairysHuff> Hat: Get the original Deus Ex first
<Hat> I have it only at the training mission for the past 12 months lol
<Kandarihu> Hat: the whole trilogy is 75% off on Steam.
<Hat> :O
<Hat> Thanks
<MegaMoonShine> Well that worked :$
<Hat> That was good timing
<Dark_Horst> he nad
<LochNessCheez> yay now he's angrier
<Dark_Horst> *mad
<MegaMoonShine> And now we must use... STEALTH!
<Espeon> Yawnrawrs.
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Theres a way in from outside, up a ladder to the roof, into a vent
<alexxm> Phase4 kill everyone
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, NO :<
<alexxm> come on it'll be fun
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, i have no where near enough ammo
<LochNessCheez> Love and tolerate
<Hat> Is Invisible War worth getting
<FairysHuff> Hat: No
<Hat> Thanks FairysHuff
<alexxm> Phase4 at least tranq them then
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, even less tranqs
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah just knock em out
<FairysHuff> Hat: It was terrible. Even the guy who made it hated it and publicly apologised for how bad it is
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, wheres this ladder?
<Hat> Lol
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: behind that mesh, i believe
<Kandarihu> So just skip the bundle and grab DX1, DXHR, and all HR's DLC?
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: gotta stack grabage containers
<FairysHuff> Round the side of the police station. I forget exactly where. Been months since I played Phase4
<Barbetos> Hat invisible war is pretty meh. On sale on steam right now though
<Spectrum_Rush> so is that like sniper ya got there Phase4 the onewithe scope?
<Chrysalis> a) invisible war wasnt bad
<Chrysalis> b) it was made by a team
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush, yeah, the preoder one
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, its engine re-loads itself just to load a level
<Spectrum_Rush> neat
<Phase4> 00,02only played ~15 minutes, it looked meh, but still
<alexxm> so whats the worst game you've played
<Kandarihu> Okay. That idea of mine will save you $0.04
<Dark_Horst> wow... the stream is WAY behind
<Dark_Horst> half a minute, at leat
<Bronysith> MORNING everypony
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Not sure but think the ladder maybe on the otherside of that fence.
<Hat> That's what I was thinking Kandarihu, Invisible War may as well be worth getting for 4c
<MegaMoonShine> MORNING Bronysith
<Barbetos> Here comes the fun
<Barbetos> awww
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Angel_Espeon10) 11WB10»11•. 10- suddenly I want a new WB message but I can't think of anything creative
<alexxm> hey Bronysith you sleep well
<LochNessCheez> morning Bronysith
<Chrysalis> worst game? World at War probbaly
<drf|away-HomePC> 02*WB03(Angel_Espeon03)02WB* - <Angel_Espeon> 13You are all now thinking about flying elephants
<BronyForLife> NOO
<Chrysalis> if you dont count nazi zombies
<BronyForLife> MW3 is worst
<Dark_Horst> yes, it is on the other side of the fence
<Kandarihu> Invisible War is worth 4c
<Chrysalis> mw3 isnt a game
<Chrysalis> its a wallet
<Chrysalis> or a cow
<Kandarihu> It's TOTALLY worth 4c
<Bronysith> are we talking about the horrible CoD franchise?
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<Chrysalis> one or the other, its not a game
<BronyForLife> perhaps
<Dark_Horst> i got there by stacking the gabrage containers in front of it
<Kandarihu> Okay. I shouldn't be complaining about games that I haven't played.
<BronyForLife> Even though i play CoD i regret why i didnt choose bf
<Bronysith> Call of duty is good for the economy. terrible for players
<Barbetos> wow
<FairysHuff> I bought Invisible War on launch. Was extremely dissapointed
<Hat> Heroes & Generals is where it's at
<Barbetos> this might work
<Dark_Horst> BronyForLife: that's why i choose to avoid CoD on principle after the first MW B)
<Kandarihu> It's probably worth more than $0.04. How much more is most certainly subjective.
<Bronysith> is Wrek streaming?
<Phase4> 00,02gota take down stream for a sec
<Barbetos> I dunno why I never thought of that.
<BronyForLife> well i did choose CoD
<Bronysith> nope
<BronyForLife> cus it was the only 'known' war game
<Bronysith> Phase4: is streaming
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
<Kandarihu> Phase4: did I miss your KSP trick?
<BronyForLife> now watching bf3 clips..
<Dark_Horst> BronyForLife: known? what'S that mean?
<BronyForLife> well
<BronyForLife> uhh
<BronyForLife> if we talk about FPS games
<BronyForLife> everyone knows CoD right?
<MegaMoonShine> Who doesn't, BronyForLife
<Bronysith> TF2 is best online shooter
<BronyForLife> yeah
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<Dark_Horst> BronyForLife: you have no idea how many people played bf, do you?
<LochNessCheez> TF2 is best hat game
<BronyForLife> well
<BronyForLife> i WANT to buy bf
<FairysHuff> Phase4: The way your heading now across the electricity only leads to gang land. Not the station
<BronyForLife> but the possiblities..
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, havent shown it
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, well shit
<Kandarihu> Okay. Thanks.
<Espeon> No I am not.
<Dark_Horst> BronyForLife: even today the battlefield 2 and 2142 servers are filled
<Bronysith> I have no respect for BF3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yes you are, don't deny it :3
<FairysHuff> Phase4: And they gang is instantly hostile ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, double shit
<FairysHuff> heheh ^_^
<Kandarihu> I honestly thought you'd answer my question while my flash was crashing. Thanks for your patience.
<BronyForLife> don't think i can trade all the CoD games for a one percent discount on bf2:BC?
<Dark_Horst> BronyForLife: believe me, going with CoD over BF was a mistake. i know about it, i have both
<FairysHuff> Phase4: There deffinately is a ladder round the side of the police station upto the roof where you can entire via a vent. But I don't remember exactly where. Though I think it's over the fence on the left when facing the station.
<Bronysith> Disreguard CoD and BF play TF2
<Ascendant> I am
<Ascendant> sleepy
<BronyForLife> i do
<Ascendant> so I'm going to bed
<Dark_Horst> bad company is not part of the bf2 line
<BronyForLife> best FPS and it keeps improving
<Dark_Horst> bf3 is bf2's successor
<BronyForLife> though premium veterans are being such a douchebags
<Dark_Horst> you mean that new 10 bucks weapons unlock thing?
<Hat> Is Livestream not free anymore?
<BronyForLife> uh 10 bucks weapons unlock thing?
<Bronysith> BronyForLife: yea. thats why bf3 is terrible
<Hat> Has anyone played Heroes & Generals
<BronyForLife> oh i see
<Dark_Horst> BronyForLife: there'S something called bf3 premium. pay 10, get all weapons unlocked. though, it seems pretty useless
<BronyForLife> well look at it this way
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: it is to cater to newbs
<BronyForLife> who pays for that doesnt have a life and actually spends money to get a higher rank
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: it doesnt ake the game bad
<BronyForLife> i only spend money buying the game
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: it is to cater to newbs and people who dont want to work for anything
<BronyForLife> not to be a 'pro'
<FairysHuff> Guys it's a game. Far more important things in life.... like MLP ^_^
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: so? how does that influence YOUR gameplay?
<Hat> The core of BF3 is no good anyway, let alone extras
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: it doesnt. I PLAY TF2 FTW
<Dark_Horst> oh... you're that blockhead
<BronyForLife> Spongebob in a nutshell?
<FairysHuff> And suddenly silence.
<BronyForLife> Indeed

<BronyForLife> hey randomnerd
<Randomnerd> alexxm: Sort of. I fell back asleep and dreamed of an ex.
<Phase4> 00,02kinda want to detatch it though
<Randomnerd> Hey BronyForLife
<Phase4> 00,02use where it explodes as a gauge for the height
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<Cypresswolf> inb4 the rocket falls over on landing
<Randomnerd> Hey alexxm, how are you?
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 the pause fails

<Randomnerd> Cypresswolf: Hey, how are you doing? What's the weather like in Texas?
<Cypresswolf> Randomnerd: sunny & triple digits :)
<Randomnerd> alexxm: I'm well.
<Randomnerd> Cypresswolf: See, *That's* why people should have air conditioners.
<Phase4> 00,02hopefully i dont explode
<Phase4> 00,02landing is the hardest part
<BronyForLife> sarcasm right?
<Cypresswolf> Randomnerd: Yes! My room is almost like a refridgerator :)

<Phase4> 00,02i might not have enough fuel
<LochNessCheez> use the power of friendship
<Phase4> 00,02oh poo

<LochNessCheez> oops
<Teddy2456> Does anypony like Versaemerge?
<alexxm> Phase4 remenber what the ultimate warrior said
<Spectrum_Rush> baby steps Phase4

<LochNessCheez> where they defeat nightmare moon
<Phase4> 00,02dat orbital velocity of 0.9
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Saturn
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: what kead you to this interesting conclusion?
<Custard> LochNessCheez: Yes... And in episode 2 her tail comes out of her cutie mark.

<Custard> Phase4: AWESOME :D
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/m8f31
*Spectrum_Rush hugs Phase4 back
<LochNessCheez> that's not even an orbit
<Phase4> 00,02de-orbiting from the sun is a little hard without cheats
<Phase4> 00,02LochNessCheez, yeah, its called falling
<Custard> XD
<LochNessCheez> xD
<LochNessCheez> :D
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma just accelerate toward the sun

<Teddy2456> I'm gay.
<MadSurge> CELESTIA!
<Sundaysmile> two of them appear happy to be going to the sun
<LochNessCheez> how fast ARE you going?
<LochNessCheez> holy crap
*Custard arm flail, waving at Celestia
<alexxm> to the sun
<LochNessCheez> omg
<Custard> :( CELESTIAAAA
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02i'm in the sun
<GilDash> So... what's happening?
<LochNessCheez> looks like rainbow dash has a lot to live up to if he wants to be the fastest pony
<Custard> o3o
<Phase4> 00,02no clue what Sumica was talking about
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: BULLSHIT!
<Sundaysmile> BLOW IT ALL UP!
<MadSurge> And you're not dead? HOW ;D
<LochNessCheez> you are going FAST
<Bronysith> LochNessCheez: rainbow dash is a girl
<Sundaysmile> it's the only sane solution
<Dark_Horst> damn you, non-collidable objects
<Custard> Bronysith: LOL :D
<LochNessCheez> did I write he?
<Custard> LochNessCheez: Yes
<Bronysith> LochNessCheez: yes yes you did
<LochNessCheez> I did
<LochNessCheez> -.-
<LochNessCheez> She*
<Custard> :D
<GilDash> LochNessCheez: Silly filly. :D
<LochNessCheez> :P
<LochNessCheez> derp
<Sundaysmile> are the astronaught's cooked yet?
<Dark_Horst> arlgith, switch to cam, this i wanna see
<Phase4> 00,02whered my spacecraft go
<Custard> oAo
<Sundaysmile> it burned
<LochNessCheez> you are going quite fast there phase
<Custard> Celestia Killed it.
<LochNessCheez> look at the speed
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Sundaysmile> it ded
<Dark_Horst> aaaaaaand it'S gone
<Sundaysmile> KIA
<LochNessCheez> look at the ffrigging SPEED
<Phase4> 00,02i think the sun is secretly a black hole
<GilDash> Phase4: You did try and fly into the SUN! :D
<Custard> Dark_Horst: :D
<LochNessCheez> no it's just got a really high gravity
<Teddy2456> Guys, I'm gay, I love men a lot.
<alexxm> why did they die
<Sundaysmile> two of them were very happy to fly to the sun
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: Seems they got a little HOT headed :D
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<GilDash> Teddy2456: That's nice. :)
<LochNessCheez> Phase4: you're going at like, the speed of light x 5
<Phase4> 00,02it says 'crashed into the sun'
<Custard> Phase4: Well when it explodes, maybe it'll be one if the Solar System isn't sucked into the center.
<Custard> Phase4: How is that scientifically possible.
<Phase4> 00,02LochNessCheez, no, 183737 M/s
<Sundaysmile> so technically you can land on it?
<Custard> brb
<LochNessCheez> meh
<Sundaysmile> otherwise how can you "crash"
<Phase4> 00,02little more than half the speed of light
<LochNessCheez> half the speed of light
<Dark_Horst> try FULL speed of light now
<LochNessCheez> lo
<Phase4> 00,02Custard, its kerbal
<LochNessCheez> lol
<Phase4> 00,02science doesnt apply here
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: They should had brought marshmellows :P
<alexxm> Phase4 is the tardis saved
<Sundaysmile> or some sun tan lotion
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<Phase4> 00,02it crashed into the sun
<LochNessCheez> try to go the speed of light
<Phase4> 00,02which i though was imposible
<gold> rainbow dash is making my game boy emulator lag :(
<Phase4> 00,02but aparently not
<Phase4> 00,02LochNessCheez, that would take too long
<GilDash> That's a lot of crashing into the sun going on there. :S
<LochNessCheez> so you CAN land on it?
<alexxm> so you have to bulid it again Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02i'm sure the game allows it
*Ponies47 Hugs gold
<Sundaysmile> youtube it
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, oh, you meen saved to a file
<Sundaysmile> see if it's possible
<Phase4> 00,02its saved
<alexxm> yeah Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02this flight exploded
<Phase4> 00,02we went to see luna
<Phase4> 00,02survived
<LochNessCheez> so, you saved luna
<Phase4> 00,02went to see celestia
<LochNessCheez> and now you killed her
<Phase4> 00,02she killed us
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<LochNessCheez> wait
<Custard> Phase4: She shouldve just sent you to the moon
<Phase4> 00,02LochNessCheez, no, we left her on kerbin
<LochNessCheez> celestia killed luna
<LochNessCheez> :O
<LochNessCheez> oh
<Dark_Horst> celestiais a harsh mistress
<LochNessCheez> we did?
<Phase4> 00,02yeha
<Phase4> 00,02desktop pony != luna
<Dark_Horst> and appearantly doesnt like getting poked by small blue boxes
<Custard> WELL IT SUCKS TO BE HER THEN :D
<Custard> Luna is pretty pony +w+
<LochNessCheez> I would have thought luna would want to go see her sister
<Phase4> 00,02LochNessCheez, considering we exploded
<Phase4> 00,02i'm fine with her staying on kerbin
<LochNessCheez> kk
<Custard> LochNessCheez: Yeah, but her sister might kill her. Luna is small and blue... All she needs now is to be a box.
<Phase4> 00,02i cant wait until season 3 :3
<LochNessCheez> ^
<Custard> Phase4: Ditto
<LochNessCheez> I hope luna gets more episodes
<Custard> But I think it's coming out in like september
<LochNessCheez> and I hope some of the background ponies do too
<LochNessCheez> it is custard
<Custard> LochNessCheez: She deserves more episodes
<Custard> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ;A;
<Phase4> 00,02currently wiki says its in production
<Phase4> 00,02and nothing more
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<Custard> WHY CELESTIA WHY
<Custard> :'(
<LochNessCheez> I think Lauren Faust said it's coming in september or something
<MadSurge> MAX MYSTERY ABOUT THE SEASON
<Custard> LochNessCheez: That means it's either GONNA BE BIG or THEY HAVE NO IDEA ON WHAT EPISODES TO MAKE
<Phase4> 00,02and nothing on the mlp:fim wiki
<Phase4> 00,02well its bed time for me
<LochNessCheez> I think it's on Lauren Faust's thingy page

<BroKnee> Harroh Ponies47 :)
<CCCP> i know
<MadSurge> LochNessCheez: if only
<Nabronyan> I heard that there is going to be an MLP Trading card game
<LochNessCheez> lol
<Ponies47> BroKnee: YAY! :)
<Custard> Nabronyan: Yay~
<LochNessCheez> I don't really like card games
<Nabronyan> I want an MLP Board game.
<Bronysith> LochNessCheez: card games on MOTORCYCLES!
<Custard> LochNessCheez: But it's the PONIES.
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<Nabronyan> Bronysith: RIDING ON CARS
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a Exploud.
<Custard> Nabronyan: /)
<Soital> 12BOOM
<CCCP> :/
<Bronysith> Nabronyan: um. thats egoraptor
<Nabronyan> Custard: (\
<LochNessCheez> ponies don't have motorcycles
<Custard> LochNessCheez: But they could ride them if they wanted to :D
<Nabronyan> If I was a pony
<Nabronyan> I'd sit in the corner all day, wondering how in god's name how I can pick things up without apposable thumbs
<LochNessCheez> you're saying they would disregard the environment by polluting it so that the pegasi have a harder job?
<Ponies47> BRB
<Custard> Ponies47: K
<LochNessCheez> I would prefer to be a unicorn rather than a pegasus
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/FM0iM
<Custard> LochNessCheez: Same because you can use your magic to make you fly. Have you seen Baby Cakes? :)
<LochNessCheez> ayup
<LochNessCheez> all the episodes
<Ponies47> Back. :)
<Custard> LochNessCheez: My point exactly
<LochNessCheez> in fact, I had an MLP marathon where I watched all 52 episodes
<Custard> Welcome back Ponies47
<LochNessCheez> non-stop
<LochNessCheez> except for sleep of course
<Custard> LochNessCheez: :O
<MadSurge> LochNessCheez: How long did it took?
<Ponies47> Thnak you Custard :)
<Custard> I have all the MLP episodes recorded on my tv :D
<Custard> You're welcome Ponies47 :)
<Nabronyan> I HAVE ALL THE MLP EPISODES ON NETFLIX
<LochNessCheez> well 52x22 = 1144 minutes
<MadSurge> Custard: nice! :D
<LochNessCheez> you can work out the rest
<Custard> Nabronyan: I can check to see if I do, I have Netflix on my Wii and PS3.
<Custard> MadSurge: Thank you very much :)
<LochNessCheez> that's like, 19 hours?
<Nabronyan> I wonder how many seasons MLP will go up to
<LochNessCheez> as long as bronies exist
<Custard> 1144 Divided by 60 would be... 19 hours...
<Custard> And a couple side minutes.
<LochNessCheez> yup
<MadSurge> Wow, a whole day of ponies :D
<LochNessCheez> I bet that eventually bronies will be hired into the MLP crew
<Custard> MadSurge: Heaven on earth
<Nabronyan> Probably
*Derpy_Hooves streches
<LochNessCheez> and they will be able to do ANYTHINg
<Skylands> 10Moo
<Nabronyan> There are some pretty darn talented bronies
<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Skylands, you are a 4Munchlax.
<Custard> LochNessCheez: I need to ask them for a job :D
<LochNessCheez> including giving Octavia more scenes
<Skylands> 10Nope
<Skylands> 10!pokescram
<ScriptBot> Scrambled word is "iicjrha". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here). Type !pokehint, !pokehint2 or !pokehint3 for a hint.
<Skylands> 10!pokeguess jirachi
<ScriptBot> That's correct! Great job Skylands! You now have 4160 Points.
<LochNessCheez> and giving Vinyl scratch red eyes
<Skylands> 10!digimon
<ScriptBot> Skylands, you are a Beetlemon.

<Ponies47> Hello Derpy_Hooves :)
<LochNessCheez> you didn't say everypony
<Custard> Morning Derpy_Hooves
<Custard> :O
<CCCP> :(
<Nabronyan> I don't care much for Vinyl Scratch's eye color
<Custard> YOU DIDN'T SAY EVERYPONY
<LochNessCheez> I want them to come up with some excuse
<LochNessCheez> like, his eye colour changes every year
<Nabronyan> His?
<Nabronyan> Dafuq?
<GilDash> LochNessCheez: You and that gender confusion. :D
<LochNessCheez> ikr
<CherryAssassin> aefswdqwfxax
<LochNessCheez> I keep saying he instead of she
<Nabronyan> I wish I could beat KOTOR :c
<diddutz> I agree with more Octavia :3

<Nabronyan> I WANT MORE DOCTOR WHOOVES
*Ponies47 Wants more crazy Twilight in seasons 3

<Ponies47> Bon Bon does to
<LochNessCheez> ya
<GilDash> LochNessCheez: She has a very nice VA too. I really like her voice. :)
<LochNessCheez> ikr
<GilDash> I like Bon-Bon's one from the Flutterage episode as well. :)
<Custard> LochNessCheez: They should make a commercial with Lyra sitting
<LochNessCheez> Colgate/Minuette needs an episode too

<Bronysith> chrysallis is the worst vvillain
<LochNessCheez> I officially became a brony when I watched all 52 episodes without any breaks in between other than sleep and school
<bloodybrony> oh ya same here
<Bronysith> ive been a brony since...like later winter
<Bronysith> i actually watched winter wrap up on the first day of spring
<LochNessCheez> lol
<bloodybrony> ive been a brony for about that long too
<Bronysith> again. i dislike this day aria so much
<LochNessCheez> first MLP thing I saw was the original movie
<Bronysith> it is not sung by any of the mane cast
<LochNessCheez> which was the worst thing I have ever seen
<TrixieBaconMuffin> Chrysalis at least is still out there , Discord is a stone and NMM exploded!
<Bronysith> discord didnt rely on an army
<LochNessCheez> IC what you did there brony
<LochNessCheez> it's not sung by any of the MANE cast
<alexxm> TrixieBaconMuffin don't forget theys still a prtal to hell out there
<Bronysith> discord wanted to rule equestria because he wants nothing but chaos
<Bronysith> LochNessCheez: yes. mane six
<Bronysith> BBBFF and Love is in bloom are the only good songs from the season 2 finale
<Bronysith> to my opinion
<Ray> 02Yooooooooooooooo
<Ray> 02I just watched the season finale of the Legend of Korra
<Ray> 02Mind Fng Blown

<Bronysith> just, i dont like it
<LochNessCheez> it's raining again
<Bronysith> the singers sound like they are whining and it isnt sung by any of the mane six
<Ray> 02After minute 27 I was like saying "Noooooooo waaaaayyy"
<Bronysith> and to me. only disney gets villain songs right
<HyperMetalLugia> Same xD
<HyperMetalLugia> It was silly :p
<alexxm> hell fire is the best villian song in my opnion
<LochNessCheez> this day aria is a disney style villain song though
<Bronysith> but it is just so done bad
<LochNessCheez> and, in my opinion it's pretty good
<Bronysith> i dont like it
<LochNessCheez> your opinion
<Bronysith> i know
<Bronysith> i also dont like skyrim
<LochNessCheez> I don't really like it that much either tbh
<Bronysith> THANK YOU
<Bronysith> i hate skyrim so much
<LochNessCheez> combat system = crap
<Bronysith> but everyone is all. "omg it is the best game ever
<Bronysith> and the community
<Bronysith> good god i hate the community
<Bronysith> it has spread to NON gamers
<bloodybrony> we all hate the comunity we are geeks for celestias sake
<Bronysith> wb bloodybrony
<Bronysith> also
<Bronysith> it is incredibly buggy, the combat is terrible. horrible and short story
<bloodybrony> that i must agree on
<Bronysith> and of course. the stupid memes that it produced
<bloodybrony> and the movement animations are awfull
<bloodybrony> idle chat sounds lik a bunch of robots
<Ninjazz|Observant> Sith going on a full page rant?
<bloodybrony> yep
<Bronysith> Ninjazz|Observant: yep!
<Bronysith> also
<Ninjazz|Observant> Woo~ Keep it up, mah man!
<Bronysith> NON gamers have started to use the stupid meme
<Bronysith> a guy at the school i used to go to
<Bronysith> who picked on nerds
<Bronysith> and made fun of gamers
<Bronysith> got pissed off at a girl
<Bronysith> and he went "FUS RO DAH"
<bloodybrony> ha pathetic
<Bronysith> i facehoofed
<bloodybrony> as would i
<Bronysith> i mean
<alexxm> that guys an idiot
<Bronysith> why. WHY!? yes. i dislike hypocrites so much
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<Bronysith> ello Malavolent
<bloodybrony> well nothing going on mutch here so i better go watch some repeats :P
<alexxm> hey Malavolent hows your day been
<Malavolent> alexxm: Great, had BBQ and met with few new people. :) How about you?
<Bronysith> brb
<alexxm> i'm good Malavolent gave a friend of mine whos a brony the address of this site
<Malavolent> Because we need more addicts :D
<Bronysith> yes
<Bronysith> very good alexxm have some sugary goods
<alexxm> he should be here soon
<Bronysith> skyrim is the worst game to come out in 2011 along with MW3 and BF3
<Ninjazz|Observant> Hey there, Malavolent! :)
<Malavolent> Suddenly, Ninja(zz).
<Bronysith> http://www.splitreason.com/product/theescapist/1225
<Ninjazz|Observant> Bronysith: I'm sure they're not that bad. But more or less not deserving of all the hype they got. I actually enjoy BF3.
<Bronysith> Ninjazz|Observant: CoD is the same game every year and BF3 includes the ultimate shortcut option. it is one of the reasons i have lost faith in gaming
<Ninjazz|Observant> Bronysith: Agreed upon MW but what's so bad about the shortcut option in BF? I'd like to see it as a way for players who don't have as much time as hard core gamers to get on a equal playing field.
<Bronysith> Ninjazz|Observant: but there is no earning the weapons. i hate it when stuff is just handed to people
<alexxm> Bronysith whats the ultimate shortcut
<Bronysith> alexxm: pay 10$ and you unlock everything in bf3 multiplayer
<alexxm> thanks Bronysith
<Bronysith> Ninjazz|Observant: like i said earlier. if you are not a true gamer. stay away from games
<Bronysith> Ninjazz|Observant: if you dont have time to play it. dont play it
<Ninjazz|Observant> Bronysith: Oh that is not fair. Just because someone has to budget their time for like... a job or something doesn't mean that they shouldn't be able to play their games.
<MadSurge> Bronysith: Anyone paying for virtual stuff in games (especially if you can unlock it through normal play) only deserves my pity
<Ninjazz|Observant> I blame EA really.
<Bronysith> Ninjazz|Observant: thats what i was trying to get to. EA is ruining games
<Ninjazz|Observant> Err... Dice maybe.
<Ninjazz|Observant> True, Sith.
<Ninjazz|Observant> Very true.
<Malavolent> I'm waiting for an independent game studie, that will make an original and creative title.
<Malavolent> studio*
<Bronysith> VALVE is one of the only good gaming companies left
<Bronysith> they dont make sequels every single fucking year
<Ninjazz|Observant> And one of the only trust worthy ones.
<LochNessCheez> back
<Bronysith> but they cant count to 3. whatever i dont care. i only want quality. NOT QUANTITY
<LochNessCheez> trustworthy ninjazz?
<LochNessCheez> REALLY?
<Ninjazz|Observant> Yes.
<LochNessCheez> WOW this is typical british weather here
<Ninjazz|Observant> What? Don't trust Gabe? Even after all the good things he's done? Just because he hasn't released HL3 doesn't mean that he is the utter troll that the internet likes to make him out to be.
<LochNessCheez> 5 minutes ago it was pretty much a shower of rain
<LochNessCheez> and it was like hail
<LochNessCheez> and now it's sunny outside
*Rain showers
<Ninjazz|Observant> Yay~
<LochNessCheez> ...
<Bronysith> Ninjazz|Observant: every single game that valve releases is awesome. i have NEVER been disapointed like AT ALL
<Malavolent> Gabe is a brony.
*Ninjazz|Observant looks out the window "awww" :<
<Malavolent> He has to be good and nice, right?
<Ninjazz|Observant> Bronysith: Vavle's trademark quality.
<Rain> 98% of all pings from here are either "chocolate rain" or someone talking about the weather
<alexxm> i had good times playing left 4 dead 2
<Rain> the other 2% are when I come in and hug one of my friends
<LochNessCheez> I swear there's like, a quintouple rainbow outside but it's hidden behind houses
<Bronysith> alexxm: ive had wonderful times with l4d2 and portal portal 2 and counter strike
<Ninjazz|Observant> Considering how much people love rain, I'm not too surprised.
<LochNessCheez> rain's cool
<Bronysith> alexxm: and tf2
<LochNessCheez> aren't you rain?
<alexxm> Bronysith might be getting portal 2 to play with my dad
<Bronysith> alexxm: thats fun
<Rain> no, I am just named Rain.
*alexxm tackle glomps Rain
<LochNessCheez> yes, but are you cool?
<Rain> but I do ever so love the falling water from the sky~
<Rain> ask the ponies that know me
<Chrysalis> Bronysith be careful
<Ninjazz|Observant> We could probably tell. ^_^
<Chrysalis> while it sounds to be awesome playing games with your paretns
<LochNessCheez> quick RUN
<Chrysalis> they will drive you mad
<LochNessCheez> It's gound to steal all our LOVE AND TOLERANCE
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: i know. thats why i dont play with my parents
*Rain hugs alexxm
<Chrysalis> nothing is more infuriating than waiting on a parent to actually figure out whats happening
<LochNessCheez> don't feed the changelings
<Ninjazz|Observant> ^
<LochNessCheez> I just ninja'd ninjazz
<Rain> I thought the pony term for troll was parasprite
<LochNessCheez> yeah
<LochNessCheez> that's because it is
<Chrysalis> some dont deserve the pony term
<LochNessCheez> but changelings feed from our love
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Hope there will be a my little pony friendship is magic episode!
<Ninjazz|Observant> We might have a newbie here...
<Ninjazz|Observant> Or newbies.
<Bronysith> how has activision gotten away with releasing the same exact game every year?
<Ninjazz|Observant> Meh.
<Chrysalis> you must be new here
<Rain> what are you talking about, GreeHetBronyInDuitsl?
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Don't know
<Ninjazz|Observant> Bronysith: Addicted fanbase.
<Bronysith> Ninjazz|Observant: it is stupid. it is the same game with the same maps and same perks and same guns
<LochNessCheez> there's like 52 of those GreeHetBronyInDuitsl
<Rain> season 2 is over and season 3 is not here yet, so there wont be one for some time, GreeHetBronyInDuitsl
*Rain hugs pony42594 "you cant hide from me" <3
