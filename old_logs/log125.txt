<ctrlx> wet coolers?
<Charles> not a lot, just reading before I go to bed
<TrollightSparkle> I worked in produce, so wet greens and stuff like that
<ctrlx> ah
<Kitten> sounds.. fun?
<ctrlx> so they stay fresh
<TrollightSparkle> Mhm, I used to ride pallet jacks and throw pallets around too :3
<ctrlx> you were the fresh provider
<ctrlx> i would like that
<TrollightSparkle> It was nice.
<ctrlx> one time at work we had fun noodles lying around for god knows what
<ctrlx> so i hid and when people walked by i bonked them with it
<TrollightSparkle> Plus one of my coworkers was a fellow brony and we talked alot, so it was better.
<Charles> totally, lol
<TrollightSparkle> That would be awesome to have at work, a fun noodle.
<ctrlx> idk where it went though
<ctrlx> haha and on april fools day i was messing with everyone's phones and computers
<ctrlx> and they all got me back because the admin acted all angry and called me into the office
<ctrlx> then april fool'd me and i didn't notice half of hte building standing behind me because i was scared shitless
<TrollightSparkle> I'm sure you were thinking you were screwed when that happened?
<ctrlx> she told me to fix her computer and was like. if you have time to do this then you have time to do your work
<ctrlx> .....APRIL FOOLS
<ctrlx> ....................................heh
<TrollightSparkle> At least your coworkers and superiors were able to joke around!
<ctrlx> yah it's a nice place to work
<ctrlx> well
<ctrlx> half the time
<ctrlx> my supervisors actually want to take me out drinking
<ctrlx> and i have with a couple of them a few times
<ctrlx> perks of a small town
<ctrlx> downside of a small town: no bronies
<ctrlx> brony's?
<ctrlx> no
<ctrlx> ies
<TrollightSparkle> Yeah, ies.
<ctrlx> ok im gonna go have a smoke
<TrollightSparkle> Alright, see ya then
<TrollightSparkle> So..
<TrollightSparkle> Lonely, I'm so lonely, everybody, on my ownnnnn
*GrimGallop appears
<TrollightSparkle> :O
<EspyLacopa> Hmmmmmmm?
<TrollightSparkle> Hai there
<GrimGallop> 0Ahoy
<TrollightSparkle> So..
<GrimGallop> 0So...
*Nat 0hugs everypony g'night
<TrollightSparkle> Good night Nat
<GrimGallop> 0Later
*TrollightSparkle hugs Nat back.
<KanyeEast> well that was fun
<KanyeEast> dungeons and ponies and all that
<TrollightSparkle> Dungeons and ponies?
<KanyeEast> we had an impromptu dnd thing going on
<GrimGallop> 0Indeed, though I'd much rather have Aberrate as a first-level spell than Magic Missile, just for the lulz.
<EspyLacopa> The Janitor took care of some piles of trash.
<KanyeEast> And Samule Jackson is a paladin of justice
<EspyLacopa> ^-- Samule reminds me a bit of The Tick.
<TrollightSparkle> Sounds like it was interesting
<GrimGallop> 0Any Gall is a sorcerer who exists to irritate the paladin
*EspyLacopa needs to figure out how to get his dicebot working
<GrimGallop> 0I need to find a DM who will allow me to use my own class.
<KanyeEast> which is?
<GrimGallop> 0The Pimp
<KanyeEast> ah, isn't that a bard?
<EspyLacopa> Sounds like it.
<GrimGallop> 0More like a bard-paladin hybrid
<EspyLacopa> That or Rogue.
<EspyLacopa> Paladin?
<GrimGallop> 0He prays the Pimp's Prayer to imbue his hand with holy power, granting him an unarmed smite attack
<KanyeEast> ^ very true
<GrimGallop> 0and gains the effects of leadership at 6th level for free, so long as he buys and retains ownership of a brothel.
<GrimGallop> 0There are a few other abilities that the class gets, but pretty much all of them require him to be under the effects of his prayer to function properly.
<SuperBrony64> Uh-oh, we need to bring the chat back to life!
*SuperBrony64 performs CPR
<KanyeEast> Live!
<KanyeEast> uh...
<KanyeEast> I think rarity is a better pony than fluttershy
<KanyeEast> that'll do it
<SuperBrony64> KanyeEast! You're alive!
<Purple`Prose> In what way?
<SuperBrony64> Uh-oh, KanyeEast is delusional!
<SuperBrony64> Hang in there buddy!
<KanyeEast> I like rarity scenes more, she's more funny and is more interesting
<Purple`Prose> I will give you that point.
<SuperBrony64> I like everypony. :P
<KanyeEast> I feel like the troll in that one comic
<Purple`Prose> Twilight, Fluttershy and Rarity are my three favorites
<Purple`Prose> Twilight is mai waifu, Fluttershy preys on my protective instincts, and Rarity is the most entertaining when she loses her mind.
<tetsuraryuuken> Is it pony time yet?
<TrollightSparkle> Let me check.
<KanyeEast> a few more days
<TrollightSparkle> Yeah, definitely.
<tetsuraryuuken> What about now?
<KanyeEast> no nappa
<tetsuraryuuken> Better drink my own piss. :(

<KanyeEast> though I prefer charlie
<TrollightSparkle> Well I eat hands and I kill people, that's 2 things.
<TrollightSparkle> I've only seen one episode of Charlie.
<Flutteryay> CARL! Why are there streamers made of human entrails in the basement?
<TrollightSparkle> My stomach was making the rumblies, that only hands could satisfy :3
<EspyLacopa> Chaaaaarlie

<TrollightSparkle> So now Charlie will please go into the candy cave *explodes*
<Flutteryay> They made ponies awesome, so they can make sea ponies awesome
<Flutteryay> You're late to the punch, Dari
<Flutteryay> But thanks, it's an amazing interview
<Flutteryay> also, >mi cara cuando there's a Star-2 tag on EqD
<KanyeEast> thats sort of...something to be proud of I suppose
<Flutteryay> >mi cara cuando you can't see mi cara cuando
<KanyeEast> like the my immortal of pony fanfics
<Flutteryay> Yup
<KanyeEast> wait thats cupcakes
<Flutteryay> Cupcakes has 4 stars on EqD
<TrollightSparkle> Be right back
<KanyeEast> I meant more like infamy level
<Flutteryay> yeah. Or Spiders
<Flutteryay> When I hear the word Cupcakes I think of Pinkie Pie's song from Call of the Cutie. Even though I have read the fanfic
<KanyeEast> I didn't read it, because I like to avoid nightmares
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOVDu7etQlc <-- hmmmmm
<Flutteryay> That song needs to be extended. Such an awesome and catchy song that lasts only 25 seconds
<Flutteryay> and i'm out
<Flutteryay> good night guys
<TrollightSparkle> Good night then
<Nittany_Tiger> Surprise thunderstorm nearby.
<TrollightSparkle> Oh hai Nittany
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<TrollightSparkle> A thunderstorm sounds nice right now
<Polarfire> rain? rain?
<Polarfire> it doesn't rain here.
<SilverMane> rain? what is this rain? we have none of this 'rain' of which you speak
<TrollightSparkle> Rain, lightning, thunder, snow, all sounds good, though a clear night sky is nice.
<SilverMane> only vodka
<SilverMane> so basically... you don't care what you get, TS?
<TrollightSparkle> Eh, not really.
<Nittany_Tiger> There are a few small storms nearby.
<Nittany_Tiger> The cores of them are going to slip SE of me, though.
<SuperBrony64> Wow, I actually like storms.
<TrollightSparkle> Same here.
<SuperBrony64> But if they kick out my internet they go on my hit list.
<TrollightSparkle> That and the power too
<SuperBrony64> I remember a lightning storm we had here near my college.
<Nittany_Tiger> I like storms too.
<SuperBrony64> Wow, it was amazing.
<SuperBrony64> I continuously captured pictures with my camera in hopes that I would capture something at the right moment.
<SuperBrony64> Got a lot of good pictures that night.
<Nittany_Tiger> Do you have an SLR with variable exposure?
<SuperBrony64> No, but I had an iPhone 4 >_<
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<SuperBrony64> I got some amazing pictures with the camera.
<Nittany_Tiger> Even with the right camera, it's tricky.
<SuperBrony64> It helped being able to continuously capture photos
<Nittany_Tiger> I remember when I used a cheap 35mm film camera to try and catch lightning. Never caught a thing. The shutter was fast.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or something.
<Nittany_Tiger> But I would pick up nothing.
<Nittany_Tiger> Mom gets me an SLR, and I finally pick up three bolts weeks later.
<SuperBrony64> Haha nice!
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> My best two days of lightning photography were in May 2010 in Kansas City and State College in 2008.
<Nittany_Tiger> Those were very lightning-active storms.
<TrollightSparkle> So guys, good night.
<Nittany_Tiger> Later.
<SuperBrony64> Here's one of my images I took that night
<SuperBrony64> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/189/photo1rif.jpg/
<Nittany_Tiger> Wow.
<SuperBrony64> Did it work?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/25/epiclightningwatermarke.jpg - Kansas City.
<SuperBrony64> Actually, to be honest, I don't even think that was an iPhone 4 haha
<SuperBrony64> I think it was my old iPhone 3G
<SuperBrony64> Oh darn
<SuperBrony64> That's
<SuperBrony64> That's definitely not an iPhone camera lol
<DecapKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXhSuOmIpSo
<SuperBrony64> Well, that was a scary song.
<Nittany_Tiger> Anyway, that was a nice pic.
<SuperBrony64> Thanks, yours as well.
<SuperBrony64> The storm was just about to come on top of us so I had to literally run back to my dorm room haha.
<SuperBrony64> But it was definitely a night to remember.
<SuperBrony64> Hopefully I'll get to see it again, but it's been a while since then.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> That night in State College, I was out in the storm while it was well too close.
<Nittany_Tiger> The constant thunder was putting pressure on my eardrums.
<Nittany_Tiger> I had to pull myself away from the action and get inside.
<Kencolt> And no stream... Oh, well...
<SuperBrony64> Kencolt: Be sure to check back on Friday for Movie Night and the big Season 1 Marathon up until the premiere of Season 2
<Kencolt> Oh, I just KNOW that's going to WRECK me.
<SuperBrony64> Haha, I have to go to the store to pick up some Rockstar/Red Bulls for that night.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm going to bed now. Night.
<Kencolt> At my age... ow, that's going to wreck me...
<SuperBrony64> Night Nittany_Tiger
<SuperBrony64> Well, as long as you don't have school/work on Saturday, just sleep during that day haha
<Kencolt> Um. 53. Kinda older than most. POny OR wolf.
<SuperBrony64> I plan on staying up all night and then just crashing as soon as the premiere for Season 2 ends
<SuperBrony64> Never too old for Ponies haha.
<Kencolt> Yes. I am 53-- 54 in two months. Old for a brony or a browoof or a browhatever.
<EspyLacopa> SuperBrony64: That sounds about like what I plan on doing Friday night.
<SuperBrony64> EspyLacopa: Friday night is 24/7 Pony Time for me
<Kencolt> Luckily, that's what e DVR is for...
<SuperBrony64> Well…in spirit that is :P
<SuperBrony64> Otherwise that statement wouldn't make any sense...
<SuperBrony64> Definitely Kencolt
<Kencolt> It will be seen.
<SuperBrony64> However, in my apartment, with Netflix and Hulu, I haven't found the need for cable
<SuperBrony64> This has been my critical point
<Kencolt> And unless Ms. Faust has chosen poorly, it will be awesome.
<SuperBrony64> So, my only access to Season 2 (beyond purchasing the episodes) will be through this stream
<SuperBrony64> She definitely has yet to let anyone down
<Kencolt> Ah. I live through Cable. Cable Modem, Cable TV, Cable phone... and Xfinity on demand to get my occiasional Dr. Who fix.
<SuperBrony64> I've seen the preview clip for Season 2 and, without spoiling anything, it definitely lives up to what the show has put out over this past season.
<Kencolt> Q.
<Kencolt> Or close to it.
<SuperBrony64> I'm the exact opposite.
<SuperBrony64> I don't think I've watched TV (cable, not including internet) once for a couple of weeks now
<SuperBrony64> I live off of Netflix and Hulu
<SuperBrony64> And on occasion (MLP), YouTube
<Fourze> dear god that was disturbing
<DecapPony> what?
<SuperBrony64> What?
<SuperBrony64> You read Cupcakes or something?
<Fourze> no i watched the latest marble hornets
<Kencolt> Oh, wel... I'm off-- so many sites to check outt before I sleep...
<SuperBrony64> What is that about?
<SuperBrony64> Okay, later Kencolt
<Fourze> the latest one
<Fourze> ?
<SuperBrony64> I mean, what is it about?
<Fourze> marble hornets in general?
<SuperBrony64> Are they an insect?
<Fourze> no its just the name of a web series
<Fourze> its a slender man series
<Fourze> its called marble hornets cause the creators wanted it to sound like a pretentious college student art filn
<Fourze> film*
<SuperBrony64> Oh okay.
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/8e86c8e2361408eadf148f70b2998aa0/57863%20-%20Bradley_M6_Linebacker%20IFV%20artist%3Aunitoone%20twilight_sparkle.png

<Fourze> not something to watch at night
<SuperBrony64> That's a cool picture DecapKing

<Polarfire> That's sad, in a way.
<tetsuraryuuken> Which is why I like it.
<KanyeEast> this is the best interview ever
<KanyeEast> apparently the creators are all pumped up from the fandom
<DecapKing> thats cause MLP Vietnam is awesome

<SuperBrony64> *6 months later*
<DecapKing> im supprised there isnt a 10 hour version of that video
<DecapKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DkqMjfqqPc
<DecapKing> FEEL THE WRATH OF MUDKIPZ!!!!!!!!
<SuperBrony64> Crud, my browser crashed :(
<DecapKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DkqMjfqqPc
<SuperBrony64> That's pretty mind-numbing there
<DecapKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBH4g_ua5es&feature=related
<SuperBrony64> Oh wow
<SuperBrony64> Was I away that entire time?
<SuperBrony64> Nope nvm
<DecapPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE7jcRCIIkY
<SuperBrony64> I love Space Core
<DecapKnight> i actually watched that entire video >.<
<SuperBrony64> Oh wow, that's some dedication
<DecapKnight> well, listened to it
<SuperBrony64> Interesting stuff
<SuperBrony64> I like learning new things.
<SuperBrony64> But in actuality, I never left.
<Rebootshy> back
<Awesomeshy> I'm thinking of just going with debian
<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHy7DGLTt8g&feature=related
<Awesomeshy> and throwing Awesome WM on there
<SuperBrony64> You're back to being awesome again!
<Awesomeshy> ohai
<SuperBrony64> So what do you do as Server Administrator?
<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0&feature=related
<Awesomeshy> stuff
<DecapKnight> everything said in this video
<SuperBrony64> Pretty awesome server stuff, huh?
<Awesomeshy> yup
<SuperBrony64> I think ChanServ is after your job :O
<Awesomeshy> I noticed
<Awesomeshy> that prince-dari hasn't replaced ChanServ with one of the pony bots
<Awesomeshy> we set it up
<Awesomeshy> where instead of having chanserv
<Awesomeshy> you can pick your favorite pony
<SuperBrony64> Really? That's cool!
<Awesomeshy> in #anime we have Applejack :v
<DecapKnight> what the pony server thing?
<SuperBrony64> So, it replies as if it was Applejack or something :D
<Awesomeshy> /msg botserv help
<Awesomeshy> no
<SuperBrony64> Oh :<
<Awesomeshy> :c that would be p cool though
<SuperBrony64> So, it's just a bot that does nothing...
<Awesomeshy> it does the same thing chanserv does
<Awesomeshy> it's just a pony instead
<Awesomeshy> we also plan to eventually use them for a statistic
<Awesomeshy> on which is best pony
<Awesomeshy> later on when we have more users
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy…duh
<Awesomeshy> lololo
<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6RbEOlqRo
<SuperBrony64> But anyway, what's the point of the other channels?
<Awesomeshy> the other channels?
<SuperBrony64> #anime…among others
<Awesomeshy> Not everone's from bronystate, we plan to host a lot of different site's channels
<Awesomeshy> each having their own channel
<SuperBrony64> Interesting stuff
<Awesomeshy> it'd be kinda messy
<Awesomeshy> if everyone was in one room
<SuperBrony64> What was even more interesting was the 18+ RP Pony Channel that was on here a few days ago
<DecapKnight> the throttle bot thing works fine
<Awesomeshy> ahahaha
<SuperBrony64> What was that about?!
<Awesomeshy> I don't even, it was on bronychat too
<Awesomeshy> We don't judge here though, we just service
<Awesomeshy> and giggle to ourselves
<SuperBrony64> True
<Sumica> Lo all.
<DecapKnight> sounds like fun
<SuperBrony64> BUT THINK OF THE CHILDREN!?
<Awesomeshy> that's the whole reason
<Awesomeshy> it says 18_
<SuperBrony64> Oh okay
<Awesomeshy> 18+
<SuperBrony64> I'll just put a sign on my door and say, you can only enter if you live in this apartment. To hell with the lock system.
<Awesomeshy> xfd
<SuperBrony64> Ooh Ehm Gee
<SuperBrony64> It's late X_X
<Awesomeshy> Eeyup
<Awesomeshy> technically it's early for some people
<SuperBrony64> I didn't accomplish a damn thing all day :(
<SuperBrony64> I went to class…but what's the point?!
<SuperBrony64> Oh well, time to roll some dice in #anime
<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?src_vid=hPJwDuxti7k&v=EUCGD1aztw0&feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_654708
<Awesomeshy> lololo
<DecapKnight> If only the graphics were really that good in the game
<SuperBrony64> !roll 5d40
<SuperBrony64> Aww….:(
<Awesomeshy> Also
<Awesomeshy> This place scares me
<Awesomeshy> I'll idle in here and afk
<Awesomeshy> and when I get back there's like
<Awesomeshy> 2k unread messages
<Sumica> Activity scares you?
<Awesomeshy> I don't usually idle in really active rooms
<Awesomeshy> tl;dr scares me
<SuperBrony64> lulz tl;dr
<SuperBrony64> Need to create some kind of Death Clock...
<Awesomeshy> wat
<SuperBrony64> A clock that calculates the exact time of death
<SuperBrony64> We need a bot for that
<SuperBrony64> That allows you to retweet it to your followers with a Tweet button
<Awesomeshy> Our bot policy is p loose
<DecapKnight> reminds me of "The Machine of Death"
<SuperBrony64> Then there you have it
<SuperBrony64> I just gave you an idea
<Awesomeshy> nope
<Awesomeshy> you should give that idea to someone who wants it :v
<SuperBrony64> Okay then
*SuperBrony64 gives idea to Awesomeshy
<Awesomeshy> donotwant.jpg
*Awesomeshy throws it at DecapKnight
<SuperBrony64> returntosender.jpg.exe
<Awesomeshy> oh u
*DecapKnight nukes it from orbit
*Awesomeshy hax.jpg.exe.py
<SuperBrony64> lol, you should compile that shit
<Awesomeshy> or DecapKnight's idea
<Awesomeshy> why would I compile a python script that's silly
<SuperBrony64> Cause it's the law
<SuperBrony64> itsthelaw.jpg.png.exe.docx.pdf.dmg
<Awesomeshy> this is silly I'm done
<SuperBrony64> Okay, time for some role playing
<SuperBrony64> You walk into the middle of a forest, you see a sign up ahead, what do you do?
<SuperBrony64> The fog starts to creep in from the north, you stand before the sign now. What do you do?
<SuperBrony64> You stand there motionless all the while thinking, "What a horrible night to have a curse". The sign still lays before you. What do you do?
<SuperBrony64> You were eaten by a Grue. Game Over.
*GrimGallop 0is eaten by a grue
<GrimGallop> 0o.o
<SuperBrony64> You would you like to play again? Type Y for yes or N for no.
<Turgle> heloo
<GrimGallop> 0Somehow I knew that was going to happen.
<SuperBrony64> Invalid selection, type Y for Yes or N for No.
<GrimGallop> 0Y
<SuperBrony64> Invalid selection, type Y for Yes or N for No
<GrimGallop> 0Y
<SuperBrony64> You walk into the middle of a forest, you see a sign up ahead, what do you do?
<GrimGallop> 0take sign
<SuperBrony64> You now have the sign. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0go west
<SuperBrony64> You are now facing west. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0go north
<SuperBrony64> You are now facing north. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0cut down trees
<MeteorVenture> woah it's all different
<SuperBrony64> You do not have an axe. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0use sign
<SuperBrony64> Hitting the tree with your sign causes the sign to break. It is no longer legible. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0continue north
<SuperBrony64> Walking north, you notice a whisper in the air as if it was a calling to you. The trees a numerous in this forest aplenty. You approach a fork in the road along with another sign. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0take sign
<SuperBrony64> You take the sign. Before you lies a hole where the sign used to be. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0go left
<SuperBrony64> You turn towards your left. You are now facing West. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0continue west
<SuperBrony64> You decide to walk west, disregarding the warning on the sign telling you not to do so. As you walk, the trees grow in number and they give off a frightening vibe as you pass them. In front of you lies a metal gate guarding the entrance to an old castle. To your right is a mailbox. To your left is an old shack that seems abandoned. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0open mailbox
<SuperBrony64> Opening the mailbox breaks the lid off. Disregarding it, you look to find an envelope. It doesn't have any writing on it, but it has an unusual heft to it. Now what?
<ctrlx> i thought about doing this sort of thing with me on my phone and people telling me what to do
<GrimGallop> 0take mail
<DecapKnight> kill a snail
<GrimGallop> 0(I did this to people on omegle once. Every path eventually led to them being eaten by a grue.)
<SuperBrony64> You grab the envelope and stow it away in your bag. You now face the gate. To your right is a broken mailbox. To your left is an abandoned shack. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0take mailbox
<DecapKnight> destroy mailbox
<SuperBrony64> You pull the mailbox out of the ground and stow it away in your bag. Before walking away, you notice a bright flash of light coming from the hole that contained the mailbox.
<SuperBrony64> Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0inspect light
<DecapKnight> piss on the bright light
<MeteorVenture> ^ typical move
<DecapKnight> you know it
<SuperBrony64> Inspecting the light, you see that it is actually the glare causes by a golden key. It has no markings on it other than the initials B.G. Take the key?
<GrimGallop> 0take key
<DecapKnight> throw the key into a river
<SuperBrony64> You grab the key and stow it away in your bag. You now turn to face the gate. To your left is an abandoned shack. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0enter shack
<DecapKnight> throw mailbox at shack
<SuperBrony64> The door to the shack is locked. You look through the window to see a light emanating from the inside. Now what?
<MeteorVenture> "ZORKS!" - shaggy
<DecapKnight> kick down door
<GrimGallop> 0open door
<Sumica> suddeny rpg.
<SuperBrony64> The door to the shack is locked. Looking below the knob, you see a keyhole. Now what?
<DecapKnight> use Awesomeshy to open door
<GrimGallop> 0use mailbox
<DecapKnight> ^ great use of a mailbox
<Awesomeshy> wat
<Turgle> xD
<DecapKnight> you need to open the door
<Awesomeshy> oh
<Awesomeshy> ok
<Awesomeshy> /hax open door
<SuperBrony64> Inserting the mailbox into the keyhole opens the door. Inside you find an old oil lantern that's lit. However, the shack is empty. All you see is a table that has a book on it laying open.
<DecapKnight> WTF?!??!?!?!?!??!?!
<GrimGallop> 0take lantern
<DecapKnight> HOW?
<GrimGallop> 0(XD)
<MeteorVenture> did you even ring the doorbell? where are your manners?
<DecapKnight> FUCK YOU TEXT BASED RPG!
<SuperBrony64> You grab the lantern. Before you lies a book on the table. Now what?
<DecapKnight> burn the book
<GrimGallop> 0take book
<DecapKnight> throw burning book at a Grue
<GrimGallop> 0http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pwned.png
<DecapKnight> wtf is a grue?
<SuperBrony64> Closing the book up, you blow the dust off the cover and stow the book away in your bag. Seeing nothing else of use, you walk back outside facing the gate. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0return to shack
<DecapKnight> steal a car
<SuperBrony64> The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.
<GrimGallop> 0(I'll tell you when I'm done in here, dang it!)
<SuperBrony64> You turn to see the shack has disappeared. Puzzled, you turn back towards the gate. Now what?
<GrimGallop> 0What.
<DecapKnight> steal a fucking car!
<GrimGallop> 0open gate
<SuperBrony64> "What" is not a logical command
<`Fluttershy> I'm surprised anypony is still awake
<`Fluttershy> >>;
<DecapKnight> I am Fluttershy
<`Fluttershy> I'm surprise /I'm/ still awake
*GrimGallop 0hugs `Fluttershy
<DecapKnight> and ive been knighted!
*`Fluttershy is hugged ^^ hey
<SuperBrony64> You walk over to the gate and see that it is locked up tight. No amount of force will open it up. However, you see there is a tiny hole small enough to fit a key. Now what?
*DecapKnight gently hugs `Fluttershy
<GrimGallop> 0use book
<SuperBrony64> You grab out the book and open its cover. Begin reading book?
<`Fluttershy> Are you guys rping?
<`Fluttershy> o-o;
<GrimGallop> 0read entire book
<DecapKnight> yes they are
<DecapKnight> did you see my poke spam?
<MeteorVenture> you just being in this chatroom puts you at risk of being eaten be a grue
<GrimGallop> 0(SuperBrony64 is now a Zork-style text-based RPG :P)
<GrimGallop> 0(Who, me?)
<RobotPinkie> omg I come back to a Zork reference
<RobotPinkie> <3
<SuperBrony64> You begin to read the book. "See Spot". You turn the page. "See Spot Run". You turn the page. "Run Spot Run". You reach the back cover of the book and close it. The book disintegrates. Before you the gate opens up without and force pushing on it.
<DecapKnight> wtf?
<DecapKnight> Sense, this RPG makes none.
<SuperBrony64> Now what?
<RobotPinkie> and ohay ponies
<MeteorVenture> :D i still couldn't figure out how to move when i tried to play lol
<`Fluttershy> -laughs-
<`Fluttershy> Wow.
<`Fluttershy> I wonder what time it is where you guys are.
<`Fluttershy> Must be pretty tired to do something so random.
<MeteorVenture> well.. to the house
<GrimGallop> 0(I've played this game before. I know all the tricks. The key is a trap.)
<GrimGallop> 0take gate
<RobotPinkie> aw, no hello? no hugs? no free ice cream?
*GrimGallop 0hugs RobotPinkie
<MeteorVenture> i should give it another shot now that i think about it again though
<RobotPinkie> I was especially looking forward to the ice cream, tbh
<GrimGallop> 0(Sry, this game is intense XD)
<RobotPinkie> lol
*RobotPinkie hugs GrimGallop
<SuperBrony64> The gate is bolted down to the ground. It will not move without so extra force. Before you you see a person standing before you in a hooded outfit. To your left, you see a mail box. To your right, you see a strange looking plant with a keyhole. Now what?
<DecapKnight> BITCHSLAP THE STRANGE FIGURE!
<GrimGallop> 0take hooded outfit
<`Fluttershy> BronyState... never inactive.
<`Fluttershy> If BronyState were a person they'd be a very happy one.

<DecapKnight> and me
<DecapKnight> posting my spamz
<SuperBrony64> The sign post in your bag has caught fire. You try to roll around to put it out but it's of no use. Your charred body lays there. Game Over.

<`Fluttershy> >>
<SuperBrony64> You walk away from the forest and enter into the sun drenched meadow. You forget why you were even in the forest in the first place. You return back to your home. The End.
<DecapKnight> you want to see a seizure inducing vid?
<MeteorVenture> i wanna see kamina play through zork
<GrimGallop> 0Woot. I win.
<DecapKnight> i need some time to find the original version of that pokemon seizure episode
<RobotPinkie> why wub NIN

<`Fluttershy> DecapKnight: no I do not want to see seizure inducing vid
*RobotPinkie hugs `Fluttershy
<GrimGallop> 0What.
<DecapKnight> oh
<Turgle> dun dun duuuuuun
<MeteorVenture> yours is the drill that will pierce through this door!
<DecapKnight> why did you say seizure inducing vid then?
<RobotPinkie> The quick flickering is kinda bad... but I love the music
<GrimGallop> 0I don't remember that being in this game. Must be something the developers put in to screw with people that pirated it x.x

<SuperBrony64> `Fluttershy: Actually yes, but you can't be a brony cause you said you were a girl.
<RobotPinkie> Being a brony isn't about how much money you have...
<MeteorVenture> then suddenly america migrated to mexico
<`Fluttershy> ....
*RobotPinkie slaps SuperBrony64
<RobotPinkie> Quiet, you :P
*DecapKnight punches SuperBrony64
<MeteorVenture> it's apparently about if you have merch or not
<SuperBrony64> Twinkle twinkle little st--*falls over*
<RobotPinkie> I have 9 brushables... Is that too much, or too little?
<SuperBrony64> Woah, you're hoarding all the brushables?!
<SuperBrony64> Hey everyone! This RobotPinkie guy took all the G4 PONIES!!
<MeteorVenture> you're not a true brony if you don't have over 10000 unique pony pictures in your pony folder
<RobotPinkie> I'm collecting them. I only have half though. :(
<RobotPinkie> lawl MeteorVenture
<Turgle> i have only 100 D:
<DecapKnight> i only have none
<SuperBrony64> You're not a true brony if you don't have Fluttershy as your wallpaper.
<MeteorVenture> lol i do have over 10000 after deleting duplicates and saving a few more
<MeteorVenture> a few more i didn't have of course
<RobotPinkie> I have two wallpapers right now
<RobotPinkie> one with Princess Luna and one with Pinkie Pie
<DecapKnight> i have the generic HP wallpaper
<MeteorVenture> i still have that normal windows wallpaper "bliss"
<Turgle> I have Derpy, RD and Fluttershy
<SuperBrony64> I have no regrets.
<GrimGallop> 0I have the bliss wallpaper being invaded by Konata
<MeteorVenture> but i have had rainbow dash as my facebook avatar for a while now.. oh ya! you're not a true brony if you.. something
<Sumica> What like from luckystar?
<GrimGallop> 0Yeah.
<RobotPinkie> Goddamn, I love gODHEAD sometimes...
<SuperBrony64> You're not a true brony if you don't eat 100 muffins every hour.
<GrimGallop> 0What.
<MeteorVenture> challenge digested
<GrimGallop> 0 2.4k muffins a day.
<GrimGallop> 0No.
<DecapKnight> i now have a fallout 3 wallpaper
<Sumica> Normandy 2 is my wallpaper. People like to use my system >_<
<Muffinz> muuuuufffinnnzzz
<RobotPinkie> If you go "muffiiiiiiiiiiiiins" whenever you see muffins, you might be a brony
<SuperBrony64> I am the milkman. My milk is delicious.
<RobotPinkie> If you tell your friends you'll be back in 10 seconds flat instead of "be right back", you might be a brony
<llama_man> RobotPinkie... i do lol
<MeteorVenture> it's like grim is whispering sweet nothings into our chatroom
<GrimGallop> 0I should delete the wallpaper folder I got from a friend and have never used and replace it with every MLP wallpaper I can find.
<Turgle> MeteorVenture, use this!
<Turgle> http://i.imgur.com/hynzs.jpg
<GrimGallop> 0O.o
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Sumica> lol
<SuperBrony64> My milk is fortified for what the world wants. What the world deserves.
<RobotPinkie> If you have to make a reference to Rainbow Dash every time someone sings "Double Rainbow", you might be a brony
<GrimGallop> 0Is there a widescreen of that? XD
<SuperBrony64> Anyone who gets this reference gets a muffin.
<DecapKnight> http://www.hdwallpapers.in/wallpapers/fallout_3_game-1280x720.jpg This is my current wallpaper
<RobotPinkie> Isn't that Psychonauts?
<MeteorVenture> dat watermark
<SuperBrony64> That wallpaper you have Turgle is too low resolution.
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: You get a muffin.
<llama_man> Ive got a MSpaint image of rarity and rainbow dash
<RobotPinkie> One of the best goddamn games in the world
<DecapKnight> Fallout?
<Awesomeshy> http://www.animuchan.org/w/src/131425456075.png
<Awesomeshy> my desktop
<RobotPinkie> If anything deserves an HD remake... it's Psychonauts.
<GrimGallop> 0Want.
<DecapKnight> i want to see a remake of Fallout and Fallout 2
<SuperBrony64> If you go into a toy store, and you sweat just thinking about whether or not to walk into the My Little Pony section, you might be a brony.
<Turgle> THIS is a wallpaper
<Turgle> http://www.tiger-pictures.net/cute-siberian-tiger.jpg
<GrimGallop> 0CAT
<Awesomeshy> Turgle: that's so lowres

<DecapKnight> http://wallpaper4me.com/images/wallpapers/ragelandscape-411279.jpeg This was my wallpaper forever
<`Fluttershy> I did the pic myself
<Turgle> my screen is lowres too
<GrimGallop> 0My cat sleeps on my desk. Usually on my arm so I can't operate my mouse properly.
<`Fluttershy> Who wants to see eeeet?!
<Turgle> GrimGallop, http://i.imgur.com/GGr20.jpg
<SuperBrony64> Crap, gimme min
<MeteorVenture> THIS is a wallpaper http://www.imageafter.com/dbase/textures/walls/b1wallbrick04.jpg

<GrimGallop> 0Lol
<Sumica> Show us `Fluttershy
<DecapKnight> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs46/f/2009/232/6/5/Flaming_Rage_Wallpaper_by_Viper_mod.jpg This is a wallpaper
<Turgle> that wallpaper
<RobotPinkie> If you have a blind bag Pinkie Pie with you as a good luck mascot for exams, you might be a brony
<`Fluttershy> http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs44/i/2009/160/2/6/Leafeon_Background_by_KimikoNyanChan.jpg TA DA
<`Fluttershy> my glorious wallpaper
<Sumica> DecapKnight looks like somthing from FMA
<DecapKnight> Full Metal Alchemist?
<Awesomeshy> `Fluttershy: that's gatta be pixelated as hell
<Sumica> yeah
<RobotPinkie> Oooh, I like it
<GrimGallop> 0I always wanted to try out alchemy, but I heard learning all the cool stuff would cost me an arm and a leg...
<Awesomeshy> lol GrimGallop
<`Fluttershy> I have a bigger version
<`Fluttershy> that I use
<`Fluttershy> o-o
<`Fluttershy> but It's only on my computer
<SuperBrony64> Hey everyone, It's been fun doing stuff and whatnot. HOWEVER, I do need to get some sleep. Good night everypony!
<`Fluttershy> the original image size is like...
<Awesomeshy> SuperBrony64: get out
<`Fluttershy> 1200 pixels by 900
<SuperBrony64> Ouch.
<GrimGallop> 0Later, SuperBrony
<SuperBrony64> I bring happiness to all and this is what I get?!
<SuperBrony64> :<
<Awesomeshy> kbai
*SuperBrony64 cries
<Awesomeshy> (ilu SuperBrony64)
<SuperBrony64> <3
<GrimGallop> 0Hm. I have a FMA background :O
<RobotPinkie> night night SuperBrony64
<Sumica> hey who wants to hear a addictive song =p
<`Fluttershy> decap... killed me
<DecapKnight> hey!
<RobotPinkie> sure, Sumica
<DecapKnight> I tried to revive you!
<Sumica> He did? how?
<DecapKnight> But you didnt take the pills!
<GrimGallop> 0Of course. Decapitation usually does kill ponies...
<MeteorVenture> sure sumica.. can't have enough addiction
<GrimGallop> 0http://i51.tinypic.com/30uutrm.jpg
<Sumica> You might know it already RobotPinkie
<Sumica> http://ponyvspony.artix.com/
<RobotPinkie> Haha, oh yeah :D
<Sumica> that title song.
<`Fluttershy> OH FMA STUFF
<DecapKnight> THIS IS MY EXPLENATION! http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs46/f/2009/232/6/5/Flaming_Rage_Wallpaper_by_Viper_mod.jpg
<`Fluttershy> I LOVE FMA
<`Fluttershy> LOVE
<`Fluttershy> LOVE
<`Fluttershy> LOVE IT
<RobotPinkie> FullMetal Alchemist?
<GrimGallop> 0^_^
<Sumica> Which one `Fluttershy?
<`Fluttershy> Both.
<`Fluttershy> Original and Brotherhood.
<Sumica> ah
<DecapKnight> FOR THE BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL!
<RobotPinkie> Me too, though I think I prefer Brotherhood... kind of a lot
<`Fluttershy> I fell in love first with original...
<`Fluttershy> but Brotherhood does kick ass
<`Fluttershy> sticks to storyline
<`Fluttershy> and has Vic Migogna!
<`Fluttershy> >>
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I've read the first 6 or so volumes of the manga
<`Fluttershy> read it online
<`Fluttershy> was horrified when I realized there was more to the story than the anime
<`Fluttershy> then was amazed
<RobotPinkie> I kinda hope they remake Naruto once the manga is finished...
<`Fluttershy> then watched brotherhood
<DecapKnight> The Brotherhood of Steel has giant suits of bloody power armor and fucking Gatling lasers!
<RobotPinkie> because the Naruto anime is so incredibly bad most of the time :(
<GrimGallop> 0How long would it be then, Pinkie? :P
<`Fluttershy> I had a friggin' FMA craze...
<`Fluttershy> it was almost as bad as my current MLP phase
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, maybe a 10th as long as the current one?
<GrimGallop> 0So about 200 episodes?
<MeteorVenture> this pony song is sadistic
<RobotPinkie> Naruto is "only" about 400 episodes :P
<GrimGallop> 0Sounds delightful. What song is that? :D
<MeteorVenture> http://ponyvspony.artix.com/
<GrimGallop> 0It's still ongoing, isn't it?
<RobotPinkie> So a good version of what's happened thus far would be 3 seasons or something, lol
<RobotPinkie> Yeah...
<DecapKnight> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/69321b373f26b9e3d84d9180920ced40/35242%20-%20animated%20cute%20daw%20daww%20dawww%20diabetes%20filly%20luna%20woona.gif
<`Fluttershy> what the hell MeteorVenture ? >>
<RobotPinkie> Best MLP fanart: http://pinkiepie.bronibooru.mlponies.com/data/f31308539dac253d7966c3781f85dedd.png
<GrimGallop> 0This doesn't seem that sadistic yet
<MeteorVenture> sumica linked it lol.. i am error
<`Fluttershy> lol
<MeteorVenture> well when i say sadistic i mean.. it's so cutesy it's just mean
<GrimGallop> 0Ogoditsonaloop
<RobotPinkie> icanseeforever.jpg
<Sumica> It's of earworm quality
*GrimGallop 0explodes
<ctrlx> oh wow the scene changed here
<RobotPinkie> You have the brain worms?
<ctrlx> what's up guys? :>
<GrimGallop> 0Ponies OuO
<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PegsGu0lDA&feature=fvst
<ctrlx> oh wow, really? :O
<ctrlx> lol
<MeteorVenture> rainbow unicorn ponies? that's not how you say pegasi
<GrimGallop> 0I feel like I should get a bunch of metal for when I'm playing WoW, because it seems like an appropriate genre for a tank.
<DecapKnight> FUCK THE TANK!
<MeteorVenture> LOL an actual tank
<RobotPinkie> My favorite Fear Factory song is the one they did with B-Real
<RobotPinkie> SRSLY
<DecapKnight> LOL TANKS IN WOW!
<ctrlx> it makes perfect sense to me
<ctrlx> they can drive you in close
<ctrlx> so you can hit them with your sword
<MeteorVenture> i lol'd
<ctrlx> and with that. i retire for the night.
<GrimGallop> 0Exactly.
<ctrlx> later guys
<RobotPinkie> night ctrlx
<MeteorVenture> goodnight:D
<DecapKnight> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-being-a-brony-saves-the-day1.jpg
<GrimGallop> 0Later, ctrlx
<GrimGallop> 0lol
<GrimGallop> 0So. Anyone ever decided to watch something based on an AMV? :P
<RobotPinkie> Yeah
<MeteorVenture> since i don't really watch AMV's.. i don't think so.. first one i remember REALLY enjoying was a PMV
<RobotPinkie> Gintama
<GrimGallop> 0:O
*GrimGallop 0waits for video link
<RobotPinkie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll0gxOp1LWY This video
<RobotPinkie> It's not that good, but I love the song and the show looked good. :P
<RobotPinkie> I mean the AMV isn't that good.
<GrimGallop> 0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7AzNYh5bo <- This one for me :D
<GrimGallop> 0That one for me :P
<RobotPinkie> and Gintama is pretty damn awesome, btw
<MeteorVenture> so.. the chat is supposed to be white now right? and if so can i change it back?
<GrimGallop> 0Looks delightfully brutal ^_^
<RobotPinkie> It's also delightfully hilarious
<RobotPinkie> and I like that Soul Eater AMV
<GrimGallop> 0Wonder if I can watch that on Netflix through teh Xbox...
<RobotPinkie> Gintama? No idea.
<RobotPinkie> and I have no idea about the colors, MeteorVenture
<MeteorVenture> but the chat did change how it looks right?
<MeteorVenture> not sure if it's just me or not
<Sumica> Cant say for sure I use a stand alone program.
<RobotPinkie> checking mibbit
<RobotPinkie> It's black for me
<Sumica> 8,03I meen i could rape your eyes for a moment.
<MeteorVenture> huh.. i'll screenshot.. also i can't see what grim says and i have to highlight it all cause it's white and blends in with the BG
<Turgle> The Ice Age 4
<Turgle> why
<Turgle> why
<Turgle> why
<RobotPinkie> That's weird.
<RobotPinkie> and lol Turgle
<GrimGallop> 0I haven't said anything since I mentioned Netflix :O
*Donraj sighs
<RobotPinkie> Son, I am disappoint
<GrimGallop> 0Oh, snap, server's back up. I could finally level up my druid if I felt like bothering to log on by now XD
<Turgle> (also: Top Gun in 3D)
<Sumica> oki sleep time now
<GrimGallop> 0D:
<Turgle> bye Sumica !
<Awesomeshy> What is up with GGgala
<MeteorVenture> this is basically what the chat looks like http://www.tineye.com/query/5d1a52e8c9187c593221382e1f677d3acc83a8f6
<GrimGallop> 0A 404 error?
<Turgle> i need a smaller screenshot
<Turgle> 150x120
<MeteorVenture> that's my max resolution you jerk
<Turgle> 150x120?
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Turgle> lol
<RobotPinkie> huh.... that's weird
<MeteorVenture> jk though
<MeteorVenture> but ya it also has a different layout
<RobotPinkie> I really have no idea why it does that
<MeteorVenture> it shows "chatting" people and "idlers"
<MeteorVenture> i'm thinking my window loaded wrong
<RobotPinkie> which page are you on?
<RobotPinkie> .co.cc?
<MeteorVenture> yep it loaded wrong
<RobotPinkie> oh, it works now?
<MeteorVenture> ya it's back to normal
<RobotPinkie> Good
<Donraj> Maybe he has a bad connection too?
<MeteorVenture> it was really annoying to highlight everything grim said lol
<MeteorVenture> after i realized he wasn't spamming nothing
<Awesomeshy> yeah but
<Kabaka> lawl
<Awesomeshy> that many clones
<RobotPinkie> I think you can just hover your mouse pointer over someone's name to highlight
<RobotPinkie> but yeah it's annoying
<MeteorVenture> wow that'd be too smart
<MeteorVenture> i don't like touching my mouse either though.. too much work
<MeteorVenture> work that i otherwise don't need to do
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah, had to do it when Val became a mod, before he had a background color
<GrimGallop> 0So why was I the only one you had to hover over? o.o
<MeteorVenture> your white text
<GrimGallop> 0The white that everyone else has? XD
<RobotPinkie> It's not the same white, lol
<MeteorVenture> all else had black text lol
<GrimGallop> 0Everyone's white-on-black for me
<MeteorVenture> yours stayed white probably cause it's specified to be white i guess
<RobotPinkie> If you've chosen the white on the menu, it's different
<MeteorVenture> isn't life interesting?
<RobotPinkie> Indeed!
<MeteorVenture> interesting but understandable
<RobotPinkie> Well, ponies.
<RobotPinkie> You can't explain that.
<GrimGallop> 0Ponies OuO
<RobotPinkie> Ponies come in, ponies go out
<RobotPinkie> never a miscommunication
<MeteorVenture> lol i never shunned ponies.. i figured out that i was probably gonna be a brony pretty quickly.. i just can't remember exactly how it went
<MeteorVenture> i was on /b/ looking for something entertaining like FBF or something but found that instead
<MeteorVenture> i never go on /b/ except when i do
<DecapKnight> http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pokmon-overkill1.jpg
<RobotPinkie> It's been a hectic summer for me, so I don't remember the exact times, lol
<MeteorVenture> well i've been around since late january or early february or something
<MeteorVenture> i have pictures on the PS3 saved with those times
<RobotPinkie> Not me. But I do like ponies.
<MeteorVenture> eh can't REALLY help not hearing about something
<RobotPinkie> I haven't been on 4chan much lately
<MeteorVenture> ya i don't like the place despite having gone there sometimes.. and i still go there alot less now.. i guess it's cause i have much more entertaining things to do elsewhere now
<GrimGallop> 0Like ponies? :D
<MeteorVenture> yes lol
<MeteorVenture> also i find it funny how different things are in those threads than on ponychan.. i see around ponychan alot of the same images reposted and such.. but on the threads on 4chan there's a whole different set of those
<MeteorVenture> dat cultural difference
<sotha> Why are there so many ponies awake? European?
<Turgle> yep
<GrimGallop> 0Nope
<MeteorVenture> nope american here.. i just woke up 4 hours ago at 1 something AM
<Turgle> ._____.
<Turgle> duuude
<MeteorVenture> so how's usagi drop? i told you i'd ask lol
<MeteorVenture> the name reminds me of like.. cough medicine
<Turgle> uhm
<Turgle> xD
<Turgle> yesterday night i felt asleep
<Turgle> so i didn't watch it yet
<MeteorVenture> alright lol
<Turgle> :D
<MeteorVenture> the art style looks like shoujo
<MeteorVenture> but it's apparently the demographic says different
<sotha> I've almost finished preparing for the move to college today, at seven am, in about four hours..
<MeteorVenture> woah nm.. maybe it's just the manga
<MeteorVenture> i have no idea.. thanks for being deceptive google images
<GrimGallop> 0Since when is google deceptive?
<MeteorVenture> when it shows a different art style than you actually ever see in said show
<MeteorVenture> and generally ALL THE TIME
<GrimGallop> 0...You win this round.
<MeteorVenture> lol
<GrimGallop> 0Seems like it's about time for me to get some sleep. Brb, need to catch a cat ^_^
<MeteorVenture> grab him by the rainbow and pull him to you
*GrimGallop 0has obtained one cat.
<GrimGallop> 0I can't sleep without this guy in my room. The next closest thing to an alarm clock I have is my cell phone, and my cell phone doesn't have teeth that dig into my flesh until I go into the other room to feed it.
<GrimGallop> 0Although it does play Final Fantasy victory music every 15 minutes until I turn it off...
<MeteorVenture> i smell a money making idea
<GrimGallop> 0Alarm clocks that inflict physical pain until they're sure you're awake? :D
<MeteorVenture> lol yes
<GrimGallop> 0http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/lights/8f1a/
<GrimGallop> 0I think that'll do the trick :D
<MeteorVenture> also "my cell phone doesn't have teeth that dig into my flesh until I go into the other room to feed it" so your cellphone grows teeth that dig into your flesh when you try to feed it?
<MeteorVenture> i am unfamiliar with that model
<MeteorVenture> also FF victory music is awesome:D
<GrimGallop> 0Anyways, I should get to sleep before sunrise XD
<MeteorVenture> alright well take care:D i hope i can stay awake for another long while.. i am already kinda tired
<GrimGallop> 0lulz
*GrimGallop 0vanishes into the darkness
<DecapKnight> I am a dwarf and im digging a hole

<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQdC-e82gmk
<MeteorVenture> yay bowser the shredder finally got me to want to do something other than sleep:D well here i come earthbound.. dunno why i even feel like actually doing something now aside from being more awake
<`Fluttershy> MeteorVenture: -pokes to scare you-
*`Fluttershy disappears.
<MeteorVenture> somehow i've become ever more tired.. oh i'm so frustrated i could just do nothing
<Awesomeshy> my god
<Awesomeshy> Steins;Gate
<Awesomeshy> how can you be so good
<RobotPinkie> Ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies
<Colgate> * - This is charybdis MOTD you might replace it, but if not your friends will
<Colgate> * - laugh at you.
<Colgate> laughs at "you"
<Donraj> Is it good?
<Donraj> A friend of mine was trying to get me to watch it
<Awesomeshy> Actually
<Awesomeshy> I'd go as far as to say it's my new favorite series
<DecapKnight> Hello Fluttershy
<Awesomeshy> and they're in production of a movie to finish off the series
<DecapKnight> sleep?
<Donraj> Mmm. Maybe I'll get around to watching more than the opening then
<DecapKnight> what is this "sleep" you speak of?
<Awesomeshy> lol
<RobotPinkie> Are you going to sleep through Celestia's beautiful day? ...she might grow resentful, y'know
<Awesomeshy> I like how they approach the time travel theory
<DecapKnight> and send your ass to the sun
<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQdC-e82gmk
<RobotPinkie> She might turn into a wicked mare of light
<RobotPinkie> Sunstroke Star
<DecapKnight> as long as we can keep luna
<DecapKnight> and Fluttershy
<DecapKnight> and Spike who is the best pony evar
<RobotPinkie> ofc, Luna will banish Celestia to the Sun for a thousand years
<DecapKnight> can we keep Fluttershy though?
<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYVPR-gBFk0
<DecapKnight> also who wouldnt want a GPS that sounded like this?
<DecapKnight> hello, Mr. Payne
<WhatPayne> Hello DecapKnight
<DecapKnight> or should I call you Max?
<WhatPayne> You are the first person to realize where my nic originates from
<DecapKnight> really?
<WhatPayne> Yah
<DecapKnight> thats pretty sad
<DecapKnight> i still havent played any of the Max Payne games yet though
<WhatPayne> Or at least first to verbally acknowledge
<WhatPayne> Been using this nic ever since 2001 when the First game came out
<DecapKnight> ive been using this nic since earlier tonight when i couldnt figure out how to get my other nic signed out
<WhatPayne> Those games are pretty good, although first one is pretty dated.
<WhatPayne> DecapKing?
<DecapKnight> what?
<WhatPayne> Did you check the Bronychat? I noticed that both Bronychat and Ponychat direct here...
<DecapKnight> i am on bronychat
<WhatPayne> So ponychat?
<Awesomeshy> my god this is the best last episode
<Awesomeshy> I've ever fucking seen
<DecapKnight> theres a ponychat?
<WhatPayne> Yeah, at least last night they changed IRC again to irc://irc.ponychat.net/bronystate
<DecapKnight> does a gray name mean that the user is afk?
<DecapKnight> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/287c39ace6d76700d6716fe87ed250db/55144%20-%20Team_Fortress_2%20big_macintosh%20fancy_mathematics%20heavy%20tf2.png Such a perfect description....
<WhatPayne> I think so...
<WhatPayne> wat?
<WhatPayne> Whoa
<MeteorVenture> if you don't say anything for a while your name goes gray i think.. dunno all about it but i know i can come back and see my name gray despite being here until i talk
<Colgate> that's a lot of GGgala_s
<WhatPayne> Yeah, it's somewhat random really...
<Awesomeshy> yup
<MeteorVenture> there must be another way to go active because i've seen some people not talk for a long time and then not be gray
<Awesomeshy> srsly
<Awesomeshy> stoppit
<Turgle> i'm going to work
<WhatPayne> That too...
<Turgle> later, guys!
<Awesomeshy> most servers ban users after anything more than 3 connections
<MeteorVenture> perhaps it's as simple as them typing a command or pushing a button or even talking in a different chatroom
<WhatPayne> Brb MAG
<MeteorVenture> alright take care turgle
<Colgate> I think he just has a terrible connection
<Awesomeshy> that doesn't explain 4 different connections
<Awesomeshy> it's as easy as registering your nick
<Awesomeshy> and ghosting the old one
<Colgate> well, he is using chatzill && xchat
<Awesomeshy> >chatzilla
<Colgate> he should probably stop using chatzilla....
<Awesomeshy> ye
<Colgate> I bet every new firefox window he opens, it opens a new irc connection or something
<Colgate> that would be a mess :/
<Awesomeshy> should probably just
<Awesomeshy> stick with xchat or something
<Awesomeshy> kvirc's p good
<Colgate> a terminal based irc user!
*Colgate is slowly switching to terminal based programs
<Awesomeshy> I used to use irssi, but Kabaka got me on weechat
<Awesomeshy> so far I like it a lot better, but irssi's still really good
<MeteorVenture> if i went to sleep now i hope i would be wide awake for the season 2 stream and the immediate aftermath
<MeteorVenture> gotta fix my sleep schedule around what's important
<Colgate> yeah, I've heard good things about both
<Awesomeshy> there's aspell support built into weechat
<DecapKnight> well my third day out of school this week
<Awesomeshy> that's what got me sold actually
<Awesomeshy> >__>
<Awesomeshy> but I also like the python scripting support
<Awesomeshy> idk what languages irssi supports
<DecapKnight> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/0c9c0b5580b1cc431532d32ce42bbe26/50409%20-%20Team_Fortress_2%20ask_fluttershy_and_heavy%20ask_heavy_and_fluttershy%20ask_ponies%20crossover%20fluttershy%20garry%27s_mod%20garrys_mod%20garrysmod%20gmod%20heavy%20heavy_weapons_guy%20shitload_of_tags%20tf2%20%E2%98%AE.jpg
<Colgate> looks like perl
<Colgate> not that it matters a whole lot to me, I don't really know perl or python -.-
<DecapKnight> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/3766bb0d569911ea191ad42fafe7b608/48916%20-%202fort%20Ambassador%20Blu%20Bonbon%20Lyra%20Octavia%20Team_Fortress_2%20announcer%20comic%20corrected%20daisy%20demoman%20dispenser%20engineer%20facepalm%20fan_o_war%20fresh_prince_of_Bel_Air%20garry%27s_mod%20garrys_mod%20gmod%20heavy%20homewrecker%20howler_monkey%20intelligence%20m
<DecapKnight> HOLY SHIT
<Colgate> I could probably edit minor amounts of code just fine, but not create without looking at lots of documentation
<Awesomeshy> Colgate: I don't know perl
<DecapKnight> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/1648709013202214d338da930191109e/49307%20-%20Team_Fortress_2%20applejack%20filly%20fluttershy%20heavy%20medic%20rainbow_dash.png
<Awesomeshy> so the python support is nice for me
<RobotPinkie> So much TF2
<Colgate> weechat supports perl, python, ruby, lua, and tcl
<Awesomeshy> yup
<DecapKnight> eeeeeeyup
<DecapKnight> and dat fluttershy head
<Colgate> not that any of that helps, since I haven't coded in any of those languages
<Colgate> but at least it would give options later when I eventually pick up a scripting language
<DecapKnight> time to install UDK
<RobotPinkie> UDK?
<Awesomeshy> also
<Awesomeshy> http://www.weechat.org/scripts/
<DecapKnight> Unreal Development Kit
<DecapKnight> I'm supprised that more people dont know what it is
<Colgate> 164 scripts, quite a few
<Awesomeshy> stuff like chanmon and highmon are super useful
<Awesomeshy> http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/chanmon.pl.html/ | http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/highmon.pl.html/
<Colgate> I have a script for xchat that does something similar to highmon
<WhatPayne> I thought you already installed it
<DecapKnight> nah
<DecapKnight> I just downloaded it
<DecapKnight> i forgot about installing it
<RobotPinkie> Ohh, yeah I hear it's good
<RobotPinkie> I can't be expected to remember all game acronyms, though :P
<DecapKnight> its not a game
<DecapKnight> its a game development engine
<DecapKnight> that was used in multiple games
<Awesomeshy> also uh
<Awesomeshy> are you colgate from bronychat
<Awesomeshy> or colgate from ponyirc
<Colgate> bronychat
<Awesomeshy> coo
<RobotPinkie> I know
<DecapKnight> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/bad67fd3bbdd6de4c979a16a716e6c38/38529%20-%20Octavia%20The_A_Team%20The_Great_And_Powerful_Trixie%20Trixie%20derpy_hooves%20neigh_team%20parody%20pun%20wallpaper%20zecora.png
<DecapKnight> just making sure
<RobotPinkie> There's not many development kits of that magnitude that you can try for free
<DecapKnight> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/059625c2c1a8335b39a27b6318586cc9/34419%20-%20Molestia%20celestia%20rape_face%20vector%20wallpaper.png Now who wouldnt want this as their desktop wallpaper?

<NewDCD> 9Kanye, there is. I'm just that good.
<KanyeEast> its like death note with giant robots and international politics

<NewDCD> 9one enemy is easy to defend against though

<EspyLacopa> Wait, that's not a moon punch. . .is it?

<KanyeEast> oh shi
<EspyLacopa> See, if you punched it too the moon, it wouldn't be counterattacking.
<Pontang> VOTOMS music never gets old.

<Pontang> How could they come up with that after Victory Gundam?
<ReticentSmolder> G Gundam was fairly awesome

<KanyeEast> also needs transformers, they may not be piloted giant robots but they still count
<EspyLacopa> Unicron?
<KanyeEast> and gigantor
<Pontang> Just give me f-ing Ideon.
<Pontang> =x
<NewDCD> 9Voltron/GoLion is in one of the DS games
<EspyLacopa> Bunnybot!
<ReticentSmolder> they won't be able to get Transformers rights
<NewDCD> 9and IDEON is in F Final and Alpha 3
<Pontang> u_u
<Pontang> mezame ideon!
<NewDCD> 9also the reason Transformers hasn't been in SRW
<KanyeEast> whose this guy?
<NewDCD> 9is because it belongs to Takara-Tomy in Japan
<ReticentSmolder> is it just me, or is the stream kind of laggy for anyone else?
<NewDCD> 9and they're really privy with what they allow into SRW
<prince-dari> No lag for me.
<DecapKnight> just you i think
<DecapKnight> I cant tell
<ReticentSmolder> damn
<NewDCD> 9they have just allowed GaoGaiGar and VOTOMs in so far
<DecapKnight> not listening to the sound at all
<NewDCD> 9and Kanye: a Banpresto Original unit
<KanyeEast> ah, shame. Optimus prime would probably have some interesting comments about all the giant robots
<NewDCD> 9as in, an Original Character for this game
<ReticentSmolder> it keeps on freezing up for me
<NewDCD> 9maybe someday
<NewDCD> 9Bamco will want to sell SRW in US
<NewDCD> 9and then they'd probably do everything to get Transformers in
<ReticentSmolder> oh there we go
<ReticentSmolder> just settled in
<ReticentSmolder> NO DAMNIT

<EspyLacopa> Heh
<ReticentSmolder> I'm pretty sure I haven't seen a tenth of these anime
<KanyeEast> all of these attacks look like they should end reality
<ReticentSmolder> yup, SRW doesn't know the meaning of holding back
<ReticentSmolder> and it just makes it all the more ridiculous when it does absolutely nothing XD
<KanyeEast> oh hey, surfboard robot anime
<NewDCD> 9we need a SRW that takes place in Equestria
<ReticentSmolder> Eureka 7
<NewDCD> 9and then Dash piloted Valks
<ReticentSmolder> I've seen this at least
<KanyeEast> I thought the main character was nearly as whiny as shinji
<ReticentSmolder> he is at times
<NewDCD> 9>Shinji
<NewDCD> 9>Whiny
<KanyeEast> so I watched ttgl instead
<NewDCD> 9y'all need to see Shinji in Alpha 3
<Fuzz> so just clarifying, the plan is to stream the episode as it airs?
<NewDCD> 9Kira: WHINE WHINE WHINE
<KanyeEast> yes, with a entire lead up of season 1
<KanyeEast> all night
<NewDCD> 9Shinji: *SLAP* You're a man, aren't you? THEN FACE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A MAN!
<NewDCD> 9that actually happened btw
<Pontang> OMG
<EspyLacopa> Alpha 3?
<Pontang> I love Eureka's voice. T_T
<KanyeEast> shinji said that? did he fuze with kamina?
<Pontang> So cute

<KanyeEast> Go team gurren!
<Pontang> I recently heard her voice playing Cosette in the Les Miz anime adaption.
<Pontang> Man it was cute.
<Pontang> :x
<NewDCD> 9guys like Kouji and Ryoma just rubbed off on him
<NewDCD> 9he actually had good role models
<NewDCD> 9it did WONDERS for him
<NewDCD> 9he actually rejects instrumentality and tells Gendo to fuck off
<EspyLacopa> Wait, who's Ryoma?
<NewDCD> 9Gendo's reaction?
<NewDCD> 9SON.
<NewDCD> 9I AM PROUD.
<KanyeEast> awesome, all shinji needed was some manly rolemodels.
<NewDCD> 9oh, and that was actually written by Hideaki Anno for SRW
<NewDCD> 9so it's sorta canon
<ReticentSmolder> ...naw
<NewDCD> 9and Ryoma is the Getter's main pilot
<EspyLacopa> As in, if Shinji had manly role models he'd actually be able to man up?
<NewDCD> 9this is the Getter
<NewDCD> 9pretty much
<NewDCD> 9the guy was broken from the lack of human interaction
<NewDCD> 9and felt unwanted
<KanyeEast> NERV should have invested in some psychologists
<NewDCD> 9then people want him to pilot the Evas and he doesn't have a say on it, and he doesn't want to
<KanyeEast> all giant robots should have capes
<NewDCD> 9if he actually WANTED to, he would kick all sorts of ass
<NewDCD> 9so then what happens when he has positive role models in his life?
<NewDCD> 9he wants to help those people
<NewDCD> 9the Eva becomes less of an obligation and more of a means for him to do what he wishes to do
<KanyeEast> so he can fuck bitches and make money
<NewDCD> 9cue him fucking shit up with a robot-sized katana
<EspyLacopa> Not a chain-sword?
<KanyeEast> not every version of shinji can be the god emperor of mankind
<MeteorVenture> what about a katana sized robot? http://contra.wikia.com/wiki/Browny
<NewDCD> 9here
<NewDCD> 9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4E1p6Ff5q0
<NewDCD> 9Shinji in all of his glory
<DecapKnight> WHO SAID CHAINSWORD?
<EspyLacopa> All that only did /10/ damage?
<NewDCD> 9that's because I had a Spirit activated
<NewDCD> 9next enemy attack would do 10 damage
<NewDCD> 9and so on
<NewDCD> 9it's called Wall
*EspyLacopa hungers
<KanyeEast> this reminds me of ff7 and sephiroth casting meteor like 8 times
<KanyeEast> I lost track of how many times all the planets had been destroyed
<NewDCD> 9for these guys
<NewDCD> 9this is just another Tuesday
<Pontang> Gered's voice is kind annoying.
<Pontang> ;x
<NewDCD> 9but he's best pilot
<Pontang> =s
<EspyLacopa> Here's a super mech villain for this series: Sinistar
<Pontang> To be honest, I loved Uso's piloting tactics.
<Pontang> Garrod*
<KanyeEast> TOTALLY NOT PHALLIC SYMBOL ATTACK
<Pontang> But I'm a huge Victory Gundam fanboy.
<NewDCD> 9FUCK
<NewDCD> 9JESUS IS EVEN JESUS HERE
<MeteorVenture> haha sinistar
<Pontang> =x
<Pontang> Jesus Yamato

<Fuzz> ah well
<NewDCD> 9I could play the next stage
<NewDCD> 9but Ionno
<Fuzz> At the Gala
<EspyLacopa> so, which pilots have the best will?
<Fuzz> At the Gala
<NewDCD> 9will isn't a set stat
<NewDCD> 9it works like this:
<NewDCD> 9you start the battle with Will at Default 100
<NewDCD> 9cap is 150
<Fuzz> hmm, what else have you got
<NewDCD> 9different battle actions raise your will differently
<Pontang> iie
<Pontang> =x
<NewDCD> 9ally kills an enemy? 1 Will. You kill an enemy? 5 Will. Got involved in a battle? 1 Will. And so on.
<Pontang> iiiiiyadaaaaa!
<NewDCD> 9many attacks have Will requirements
<NewDCD> 9Giga Drill Breaker needs 130 Will for example
<KanyeEast> sadly we can't read the moon runes
<Pontang> Hohoho
<NewDCD> 9DEM RED SHOULDERS
<Pontang> eyyup
<RobotPinkie> Ohay ponies

<NewDCD> 9you know
<NewDCD> 9Pon
<NewDCD> 9there's this Japanese guy who built a 1:1 Scopedog statue
<KanyeEast> so the japanese use '!" I wonder how they indicated exclamation before
<NewDCD> 9now he's building a real mech
<Pontang> I heard of that.
<NewDCD> 9as in, piloteable mech
<NewDCD> 9powered by Diesel
<NewDCD> 9and running V-Sido OS
<NewDCD> 9the Kuratas...it's basically a real Armored Trooper
<NewDCD> 9he might also be hinting on going commercial with those mechs
<NewDCD> 9so DRIVING SCOPEDOGS TO WORK ALL DAY ERRY DAY
<Pontang> ;x
<Pontang> Shame I wouldn't really have much of a need to walk wiht it. I'd just skate there.

<Pontang> Lol, not sure how I forgot the name of the scopedog when it's on the screen.
<Pontang> ;x
<Fuzz> All the creatures, Ill befriend them
<KanyeEast> we need someone like tony stark to build our own pilotable robot suit
<NewDCD> 9the Kuratas looks badass
<NewDCD> 9I'll pilot that shit
<NewDCD> 9ohai Fyana, Ypsilon
<Pontang> Get to see her nude alot.

<NewDCD> 9Ali Al-Sanchez dealing with the Society?
<NewDCD> 9this can't end well
<Pontang> Indeed
<Pontang> Fiana looks like an older Tiffa from Gundam X.
<Pontang> Oh Kamille, why did you have to go insane? :(
<Pontang> Tomino likes to run with that one.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, you're streaming SRW again?
<Pontang> He did the same at the end of Victory Gundam with Katejina.
<RobotPinkie> or is this a test going on?
<Fuzz> If there are any australian bronies in here wondering,
<Fuzz> s2 stream is on saturday nightr
<Fuzz> 9 pm western, 9.30 central, 10 eastern

<Pontang> tehehe
<Pontang> Lol, a Gundam against an AT.
<Pontang> That's a bit of an over kill.

<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9http://meltyylove.blog138.fc2.com/blog-entry-35.html Dear God I'd SPIGOT-VX that

<NewDCD> 9...I just realized
<NewDCD> 9how I draw BlueBlood Humanized...
<NewDCD> 9looks like Quattro
<NewDCD> 9ain't that Freudian
<Flutteryay> Hi everypony.
<NewDCD> 9yo
<Fuzz> yo
<Flutteryay> Registered my nickname
<RobotPinkie> Probably a good plan, Flutteryay
<RobotPinkie> and ohai also
<Flutteryay> Hai :3
<Fuzz> how do you register a name
<Barry> And now... for something truly random... Asampasana squash banana...
<EspyLacopa> Rafeeki time?
<NewDCD> 9./msg nickserv register password email
<Fuzz> eee a eee a o a eee
<Flutteryay> you type /msg NickServ REGISTER (password) (email)
<Flutteryay> Ninja'd
<Flutteryay> Barry, nice Lion King reference
<RobotPinkie> lol I was typing it out too, until I saw NewDCD had posted it
<Flutteryay> I have 2 look at thye keyboard when I type
<MrChang> hey everypony
<EspyLacopa> Yar, MrChang!
<Flutteryay> Yarr
<Fuzz> sup mrchang
<MrChang> does anybody know how to modify the color of your text using mirc?
<Fuzz> oh sick. registered
<Fuzz> 3yay
<Flutteryay> *inhales* Yay~
<Fuzz> 0oops
<NewDCD> 9I do
<NewDCD> 9but colors are mod-only
<MrChang> i know
<Fuzz> 0got a warning
<MrChang> im asking for the D&P session
<Fuzz> 0derp
<MrChang> also
<MrChang> is it possible for us to create an official bronystate D&P chatroom?
<NewDCD> 9I think it was Ctrl + Color's number
<MrChang> but it requires you to keep doing that
<NewDCD> 9also we could provide the bot, but you'd better create it yourself
<NewDCD> 9we can't register more than ten rooms
<NewDCD> 9so we have to be wary of that limit
<MrChang> does it cost money? or some way?
<MrChang> or i just do the #...
<NewDCD> 9just the hashmark
<MrChang> alright cool
<NewDCD> 9you gotta register it like you'd register any channel though
<MrChang> how?
<MrChang> #themoon
<NewDCD> 9with chanserv
<NewDCD> 9don't know very well
<NewDCD> 9also that's our ban appeal channel LOL
<NewDCD> 9try another name
<MrChang> we were using it for D&P yesterday, sorry
<NewDCD> 9it's kay
<MrChang> but making a channel, will that cost money in any way?
<NewDCD> 9nope
<MrChang> so how do i set up a channel?
<NewDCD> 9http://www.mirc-anleitung.de/IRC-register-channels.html
<MrChang> #Bronystate D&P
<NewDCD> 9try without the spaces
<MrChang> are underscores allowed?
<NewDCD> 9indeed they are
<EspyLacopa> Is ze channel up, Mr Chang?
<MrChang> yes
<RobotPinkie> holy shit Dresden Files ponyfic? I'm gonna have to read that...
<MrChang> so DCD
<MrChang> the template
<MrChang> ./msg ChanServ register #Channel Password Channel_description
<MrChang> i should do /msg chanserv register #Bronystate_D&P?
<RobotPinkie> You don't have to register a channel just to use it, though... right?
<NewDCD> 9yeah, the latter is fine
<MrChang> its no password and i dont wish to have a description
<NewDCD> 9you don't, but it might be better if you do
<NewDCD> 9mainly since I have to ask dari to get his bot there
<EspyLacopa> Registering is useful so that it can't get hijacked.
<MrChang> so
<MrChang> its better if i do what?
<MrChang> have a PW?
<NewDCD> 9better if you register it, which you are already doing
<RobotPinkie> ohay AllisZero
<MrChang> so i can just type /msg chanserv register #Bronystate_D&P in that chatroom?
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<AllisZero> Hey RP, how goes it
<MrChang> it said *chanserv* register #Bronystate_D&P
<MrChang> that means its registered, correct?
<NewDCD> 9I believe so, yes
<Kabaka> MrChang: I assume you mean register that channel here. You must be signed in to a NickServ account to register channels. If you look in the server tab of your client, you will probably see a message from ChanServ about that.
<MrChang> nickserv acc?
<MrChang> it says im not logged in
<MrChang> okay, i registered a nickserv
<Kabaka> Now you should be able to register the channel. :-)
<Kabaka> Just remember to sign in to NickServ after connecting.
<MrChang> how do you "sign in" with nickserv?
<EspyLacopa> You said you're using mIRC, right? You should have an option to give a password in your connection settings so that it does so automatically.
<MrChang> oh ok
<MrChang> lemme check
<MrChang> hold up
<EspyLacopa> Heck, technically so does the full out Mibbit client on their website.
<MrChang> so i registered the server
<MrChang> is there a way to permanently mod myself?
<MrChang> because i lose it when i exit and re-enter the D&P room
<Kabaka> MrChang: If you are identified with NickServ, you will be auto-opped.
<NewDCD> 9nice going, Dai-Guard!
<NewDCD> 9now do that one more time!
<NewDCD> 9nice!
<MrChang> nvm i got it :D
<NewDCD> 9one last dodge, Dai-Guard!
<NewDCD> 9aww yeah!
<AllisZero> Back to the crappy connection speed, RobotPinkie
<AllisZero> It's the VPN, it has to be
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, that's not fun
<RobotPinkie> How's things otherwise?
<AllisZero> Yeah, but I'm not sure if it's a problem on my side, or at home
<Turgle> heyall
<AllisZero> They were working perfectly yesterday until I rebooted everything :(
<DecapKing> http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/chatroulette-trolling-ask-haddaway.jpg
<NewDCD> 9awww yeah, I love this attack
<RobotPinkie> That's strange, AllisZero
<MrChang> okay
<MrChang> i got it working :D
<MrChang> so one more question
<MrChang> how do you switch your text color with mIRC?
<MrChang> the crtl K only works for 1 line
<AllisZero> Yep, the speed is just abysmal
<RobotPinkie> :(
<CubeJackal> I'm here to clog up servers and chew gum.
<CubeJackal> And-- Oh, hey, here's some gum.
<AllisZero> Well, I'm not gonna spend any more time on this
<AllisZero> Lost my entire morning already
<Pontang> Ohai Loran
<Pontang> Loran no gotoku!
<Pontang> ;x
<VioletVanilla> 6Ohai maaaahhhhhk~
<VioletVanilla> 6Ohai doggyyyyy~
<CubeJackal> What a story, Mark.
<DecapKing> cool story bro
<MrChang> does anybody here know how to use mirc well?
<Rainbow-Dash> Wait.. What VioletVanilla?
<VioletVanilla> 6Have you ever seen The Room Rainbow-Dash? ;3
<VioletVanilla> 6MrChang, I am using mIRC, what do you need help with?
<Pontang> Dat hyaku shiki
<MrChang> okay
<MrChang> i want to permanently change the color of my text
<MrChang> wait
<Turgle> colors are only for ops
<MrChang> i know colors here are mods only but, i got permission from DCD
<Turgle> :D
<AllisZero> I'm losing so much of my time at work
<MrChang> to open an official bronystate D&P chatroom
<AllisZero> TO create something that will allow me to lose time at work
<MrChang> and im running it
<AllisZero> This isn't worth it
<NewDCD> 9yeah the colors are for mods rules only applies to our rooms
<MrChang> since im the DM
<NewDCD> 9that's Chang's room so yeah
<MrChang> i want people to see my text better and it being able to stand out
<CubeJackal> Dat overkill
<MrChang> and instead of pressing crtl K every single line
<MrChang> is there a way where i can set my text to a color
<MrChang> and all my lines will be that color
<NewDCD> 9OH MAI GAWD IT'S A PERFECT SOLDIA
<Rainbow-Dash> No, I havent seen The Room. XD
<MrChang> so...any way to do that?
<NewDCD> 9is it just me
<NewDCD> 9or is Ypsilon like a scared kid in this game?
<Pontang> Lol
<Turgle> LOL
<Pontang> Ypsilon...
<NewDCD> 9ohai Rochina
<Turgle> MrChang, http://leonardo.spidernet.net/Copernicus/831/mirc/tips5/color.html#colors
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9enough SRW for today
<EspyLacopa> Thundercats!
<Pontang> Oh noz
<NewDCD> 9I think the stream will run just fine
<Turgle> yay :D
<EspyLacopa> Hmm. So Dari is using 0,12 for those updates?
<prince-dari> What?
<prince-dari> If you mean colour code, nope.
<EspyLacopa> Well, blue background, white text?
<Turgle> green text
<NewDCD> 9hey Dari
<NewDCD> 9get on Skype
<prince-dari> Ok, give me a minute to read the 300+ messaages.
<Jason> hey Reverend789
<Jason> :/
<VioletVanilla> 6Wery silent in here. . .
<EspyLacopa> We're hunting wabbits
<Turgle> oh
<DecapKing> i can sing the doom song!
<DecapKing> doom
<DecapKing> doom
<DecapKing> doom
<DecapKing> doom
<Turgle> hey lady
<Turgle> space
<DecapKing> AEIOU
<DecapKing> Pro Tip: Never fire a grenade rifle at point blank range in Fallout:New Vegas, you will get injured
<EspyLacopa> But it's so much fun!
<FreezeFrame> brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
<DecapKing> Pro Tip: To kill a giant radscorpion, damage it until it dies
<RobotPinkie> Pro Tip: Never fire the Fat Man at point blank range, either.
<EspyLacopa> What if it doesn't die when it's killed?
<DecapKing> Then you are fucked
<RobotPinkie> Pro Tip: You can't rocket jump in San Andreas, but you CAN grenade jump.
<DecapKing> Pro Tip: It may take 2 hits from a grenade rifle to kill a bighorner, but only one from your cyberdog companion's bite
<LoLZorZs> At which hour does the stream start?
<DecapKing> Pro Tip: The cop AI in Saints Row 2 is FUCKING INSANE!
<RobotPinkie> No official stream today, so I dunno
<RobotPinkie> On Saturday, you mean?
<LoLZorZs> k how about for season 2?
<LoLZorZs> yes saturday
<RobotPinkie> I think it's 9AM eastern
<EspyLacopa> The episode airs at 9 AM eastern.
<Turgle> 9AM EST
<Turgle> 2 PM GMT
<LoLZorZs> what time is it now?
<EspyLacopa> Turgle, actually it's 1 PM GMT.
<LoLZorZs> i live in Europe =)
<Turgle> uhm
<Turgle> no
<EspyLacopa> GMT cares not for daylight savings.
<Turgle> it's 2pm
<Turgle> OH!
<RobotPinkie> 3PM Central European Time
<Turgle> yes
<Turgle> im sorry you are right
<RobotPinkie> wait, is he?
<RobotPinkie> then it's 2PM CET I guess...
<Turgle> but according to ponycountdown it will be 2PM GMT
<RobotPinkie> ....no I'm pretty sure it's 2PM GMT
<DecapKing> Pro Tip: If you lose sight of one of your companions that is a super mutant, you might be fucked
<EspyLacopa> http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/
<RobotPinkie> CET is EST+6
<RobotPinkie> GMT is EST+5
<EspyLacopa> It is currently 5:43 PM GMT
<Turgle> nope
<Turgle> it is currently 6:43
<Turgle> GMT
<Turgle> i live in GMT+1
<EspyLacopa> Yes, but we aren't /on/ EST. Us East Coast USA people are on Eastern /Daylight/ Time.
<Turgle> here is 7:43
<Turgle> uhm
<Turgle> i'm not getting it
<EspyLacopa> EST: GMT -5.
<EspyLacopa> EDT: GMT -4
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay
<Turgle> kaaaay
<RobotPinkie> lolwait, no...
<RobotPinkie> Seriously, punch in "current time in New York" into Google
<Turgle> RP:
<RobotPinkie> then punch in "current time in London
<Turgle> USA & Canada clocks are on Daylight Saving Time
<DecapKing> its 1pm in NYC
<EspyLacopa> Pinkie.
<FreezeFrame> More like 1:45
<Turgle> Europe / UK clocks are on Summer Time
<EspyLacopa> London isn't on GMT right now, it's on BST.
<EspyLacopa> IE, GMT +1.
<FreezeFrame> And Summer Time is the same as DST
<DecapKing> FUCK YOU CONFUSING TIME ZONES!
<RobotPinkie> lol okay
<FreezeFrame> Different days they switch, though.
<EspyLacopa> DecapKing: I blame Daylight Savings.
<Turgle> what a stupid international system to count time
<EspyLacopa> What messes it up is the whole Daylight Savings nonsense.
<Turgle> we need STANDARDS
<EspyLacopa> We /do/ have a standard. It's called GMT.
<EspyLacopa> Greenwich Mean Time.
<Sumica> DST we should just follow arazonas example and say dont need it it's obsoleate.
<RobotPinkie> So the show doesn't air at 9AM if you're in New York
<EspyLacopa> Sumica: That's an awesome show.
<DecapKing> well its harder here in the Midwest when you are a farmer
<Sumica> Pardon?
<Turgle> EspyLacopa, it was a sarcastic sentence
<DecapKing> although im not
<EspyLacopa> http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=179 <-- First result from googling "Current time in New York"
<Sumica> Well perhaps when farmers needed the extra Daylight hours
<EspyLacopa> Hmmm. They're on EDT, ie GMT-4.
<DecapKing> they do
<EspyLacopa> Sumica: Farmers start their day with the sun rises.
<DecapKing> cause they still bitch about it
<WhatPayne> Just read the Silent Ponyville... was not a good idea.
<EspyLacopa> Daylight Savings was a wartime measure for factory workers and such.
<DecapKing> it wasnt taht bad WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> Sad
<WhatPayne> so sad
<WhatPayne> Luckily multiple endings
<Sumica> the time on the clock has noting to do with when the sun comes up
<RobotPinkie> So what states are on EST?
<DecapKing> from MI east
<EspyLacopa> right now?
<RobotPinkie> Right now, yes
<RobotPinkie> which states are not on EDT
<EspyLacopa> I don't know any US states that ignore the whole daylight savings nonsense.
<EspyLacopa> At least on the East Coast.
<DecapKing> I give up on this conversation
<MrChang> all US states follow it
<MrChang> derp
*WhatPayne now feels slightly down...
<Sumica> Incorect MrChang
<RobotPinkie> That's kind of confusing then, to list times for EST, isn't it?
<MrChang> who doesn't?
<MrChang> montana?
<MrChang> north dakota?
<FreezeFrame> Espy: Indiana used to
*MrChang immediately hugs Pinkie-Pie
<EspyLacopa> RobotPinkie: Indeed.
<FreezeFrame> The only state that still ignores DST is Arizona
<WhatPayne> You talking about time zones?
<FreezeFrame> And frankly, buck Arizona
<Pinkie-Pie> Yes.. Hi MrChang
<DecapKing> Hello Pinkie
<Sumica> Arizona and Hawaii as well as most US tertitories
<MrChang> i can't help it
<MrChang> she's my favority
<Pinkie-Pie> I know, I know..
<MrChang> favorite
<MrChang> : D
<Pinkie-Pie> :P
<Pinkie-Pie> How did you notice me so fast though..?
<EspyLacopa> Fav Rarity?
<MrChang> im on mIRC
<MrChang> sorry i have quick eyes
<MrChang> its a habit
<MrChang> thats why im a day trader :D
<RobotPinkie> So when The Hub lists things as being at Eastern time, you're saying they mean EST?
<MrChang> yes
<MrChang> everybody loves EST
<EspyLacopa> The Hub is likely referring to EDT right now, since it's a US network.
<RobotPinkie> I think that's either completely wrong, or complete lunacy :P
<RobotPinkie> list 4 times, one of which applies nowhere in the US
<NewDCD> 9hey guys
<NewDCD> 9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8TB7gX4f8
<NewDCD> 9SHINJI IKARI: FUCKING SAMURAI
<WhatPayne> I need a hug
<Sumica> And just where did he get a vibrosword.
*Turgle hugs WhatPayne
*VioletVanilla hugs WhatPayne~
*WhatPayne hugs back
<WhatPayne> Thank you
*Pinkie-Pie hugs WhatPayne
<RobotPinkie> Well, it says 9AM eastern on The Hub site, so... I'm guessing that's not 9AM EST...
<DecapKing> im not the hugging type of person
<Rainbow-Dash> Im usually not either.
<NewDCD> 9Sumica, the series bible show he was planned to have it since day 1
<NewDCD> 9but it never made it into the actual show
<WhatPayne> It's okay to hug here
<NewDCD> 9but it's pretty much everpresent in the games
<NewDCD> 9also it actually IS a Vibrosword
<DecapKing> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Sumica> If you are on the hub site it shows your local times IIRC or you can at least set it to your local time.
<DecapKing> I GOT KILLED BY A CAZADOR!
<ctrlx> so i just woke up, right? and i was like
<RobotPinkie> which still means 2PM in London and 3PM in central Europe
<ctrlx> trying to put pants on, right?
<ctrlx> and i like
<ctrlx> almost fell over
<Sumica> one leg at a time ctrlx
<RobotPinkie> So yeah, good to know.
<ctrlx> anyways, you guys think that since there was a winter wrap up in s1 that there'll be a winter..unwrapping?
<Sumica> for the record on DST and such most dont take intoaccount things like EST and EDT
<DecapKing> damn
<DecapKing> died again
<DecapKing> fucking cazadors
<RobotPinkie> So 3 days left
<ctrlx> i'm pretty damnn excited
<WhatPayne> Hm RobotPinkie?
<Aponymous> SO excited.
<RobotPinkie> Me too, especially since I listened to the Thiessen interview
<AllisZero> fqf
<AllisZero> Guys?
<AllisZero> Guuuys?
<RobotPinkie> He's really good at getting bronies pumped
<ctrlx> man i forgot to listen to that before i went to bed
<RobotPinkie> hay AllisZero
<Sumica> Sup AllisZero
<WhatPayne> So when is the actual airing of season 2?
<RobotPinkie> Oh go download it and listen, it's awesome :O
<RobotPinkie> 9:00 EDT.... I'm guessing
<WhatPayne> EDT?
<Sumica> it's the same as est
<RobotPinkie> Eastern Daylight Time, which is the EST time zone
<Turgle> thiessen interview? :O
<Turgle> didn't know about that
<ctrlx> omg i put a shirt on all by myself!
<ctrlx> i'm a big boy!
<AllisZero> Hahaha I'm tetherd through my phone, into my VPN at home
<ctrlx> thethering <3
<RobotPinkie> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/exclusive-season-2-audio-interview-with.html
<RobotPinkie> Go listen NAO
<WhatPayne> EST=GMT-5?
<AllisZero> Looks like my problem here really is on my side of the network, not at home
<RobotPinkie> It's not spoilerific at all, but has a lot of good info on the show
<ctrlx> season 2 is going to be like the winter wrapup of my soul
<NewDCD> 9-4 I Think
<ctrlx> :O
<RobotPinkie> and TONS of brony love
<ctrlx> AllisZero, probably. i know with att they like to filter some ports
<RobotPinkie> No, EST is GMT-5
<WhatPayne> Ah thanks DCD
<WhatPayne> Wait what?
<RobotPinkie> Check it on google. "current time in new york" and "current time in london"
<ctrlx> AllisZero, any encryption has always given me troubles
<EspyLacopa> Yes, EST is GMT-5.
<ctrlx> GUYS I CAN'T FIND ANY SOCKS
<RobotPinkie> subtract one from the other, voila :P
<DecapKing> wow
<DecapKing> you people really care about your time
<EspyLacopa> New York however is currently on EDT, and thus GMT-4.
<WhatPayne> In most states in the USA and in most provinces in Canada, Daylight-Saving Time (DST) is observed. During DST the time is shifted forward by 1 hour to EDT; which is 4 hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT-4).
<WhatPayne> After the Summer months Eastern Time is shifted back by 1 hour to US Eastern Standard Time (EST) or (GMT-5).
<WhatPayne> This confuses me
<RobotPinkie> Yes, EspyLacopa, but London is also one hour off...
<AllisZero> I have a dedicated 10 meg fiber pipe at work, they shouldn't block any ports
<AllisZero> So it's my firewall really
<EspyLacopa> Because right now London is on BST (British Summer Time)
<EspyLacopa> Seriously Pinkie, stop and actually read the info the page is saying.
<Turgle> thanks RP
<RobotPinkie> No, Espy, when people say "I'm at GMT," they mean they're in London
<EspyLacopa> Then they're wrong.
<EspyLacopa> right now London isn't on GMT.
<EspyLacopa> GMT never changes due to seasons.
<EspyLacopa> The time in London does.
<ctrlx> guys i am all dressed and ready for work! :D
<ctrlx> :D i really don't wanna go
<Sumica> we dont want you to go either ctrlx, If you have a hard time geting dressed i dont want to think about you driveing.
<Turgle> ^
<RobotPinkie> lol
<ctrlx> oh don't worry. my license is suspended
<Turgle> ._.
<Turgle> OH WELL
<ctrlx> i get it back the 28th though
<WhatPayne> Well I stay here through the whole day and spy for the airing to start anywho so it does not matter
<Turgle> everybody loves bikes
<ctrlx> Turgle, 5 miles out of town and its raining ;P
<Turgle> everybody loves bikes
<Turgle> .
<ctrlx> mine is broken
<ctrlx> :s
<Turgle> D:
<ctrlx> i didn't love it enough
<ctrlx> i fed it
<ctrlx> and watered it
<ctrlx> but just didn't love it enough ;-;
*ctrlx off to brush teeth and whatnot then wait for ride to come
<EspyLacopa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_Savings <-- Look at the map to see how much of the world observes Daylight Savings
<Turgle> 40%
<RobotPinkie> Trust me, I know, we observe it here as well.
<prince-dari> Stream's up.
<WhatPayne> Ok now I'm starting to feel a bit better...

<CrystalClear> http://blueshift2k5.deviantart.com/art/Bloomberg-s-Last-Hurrah-256381719
<Sumica> Not the dots oh god the dot, they are in my eyes.
<Pinkie-Pie> @madmeter prince-dari
<Pinkie-Pie> Steven, Y U NO MAGNET?
<VioletVanilla> 6Did I just see you post about caramel?
<VioletVanilla> 6inb4 Val shows up D:
<CrystalClear> yes you did
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ...................................
<CrystalClear> oh god, you're right
<Pinkie-Pie> Its supposed to get harder
<Pinkie-Pie> Lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well I clearly have wonderful timing
<CrystalClear> ValtheJean... i'm sorry but... here http://blueshift2k5.deviantart.com/art/Bloomberg-s-Last-Hurrah-256381719
<Sumica> Yousa gonna die
<CrystalClear> this story explains why caramel became a filly
<DecapKing> Dari u mad?
<VioletVanilla> 6HURRY VAL! THE TRIDENT! ;D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 why oh why do I have to be RESPONSIBLE with my mod powers?
<CrystalClear> i didn't write it, i just read it today
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<DecapKing> didnt we stop val from using his tridnt?
<CrystalClear> it was on EQD
<Dermathil> 40 million EqD coming soon
<EspyLacopa> The commentary makes it 20% cooler.
<Sumica> So what or who did Val's fave pony get shipped with this time?
<CrystalClear> Prince-Dari has sexy voice, course it does
<CrystalClear> Sumica, Applejack
<Dermathil> Valthejean: because with great powers comes great responsibilities.
<Pinkie-Pie> Check your PMs CrystalClear
<Sumica> You got it Dari
<DecapKing> its close but no cigar Dari
<VioletVanilla> 6Dari the red box has been destroyed D;
<Sumica> Also close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.
<CrystalClear> so, Caramel is tired of Applejack rejecting his advances
<WhatPayne> There's a joke in here somewhere about blue balls
<DecapKing> i chose not to make it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay I really don't need you to describe it to me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 at all
<DecapKing> you should anyways
<CrystalClear> awww, okay val :( but I luvs you <3
<Pinkie-Pie> That game is scarier than Dead Island
<Pinkie-Pie> Or Silent Hill even
<DecapKing> you called dead island scary?
<Sumica> yfw
<VioletVanilla> 6Box Dari is best Dari
<Pinkie-Pie> Not sure if I would call it scary. Kinda nerve wracking
<DecapKing> get a whore
<EspyLacopa> lol
<Sumica> here's the part where he kills you
<Pinkie-Pie> Feeling a bit tipsy Sumica?
<Pinkie-Pie> Lol
<DecapKing> then insta killed
<DecapKing> called it
<Pinkie-Pie> Purple dots are best dots.
<Sumica> Must be from all the red they got.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, dari is being a hardcore gam0rz?
<Pinkie-Pie> Waiting for todays S2 screenshot
<Sumica> Turn your head and cough.
<Pinkie-Pie> After seeing yesterdays.. Im kinda scared
<Pinkie-Pie> XD
<Silvermane> i love how i learned to change my nick
<RobotPinkie> Yo, prince-dari, after you're done with this, could you play Ninja Gaiden on Way of the Master Ninja?
<Pinkie-Pie> How do you like, THEM apples?
<RobotPinkie> I've always wanted to see a "no upgrade run"
<Sumica> Big mac line here.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dari should get WC3 and stream us playing it :P
<RobotPinkie> Now THAT I could get behind, Val
<VioletVanilla> 6:33
<MrChang> ew
<ValtheJean> Warcraft III
<MrChang> wc3?
<RobotPinkie> ohay VioletVanilla :3
<ValtheJean> not WoW
<ValtheJean> WoW is an abomination
<ValtheJean> Warcraft III is a strategy game
<Sumica> half wrong
<ValtheJean> WoW murdered everything that was good about Warcraft
<ValtheJean> literally
<ValtheJean> it killed off all the good characters
<RobotPinkie> WoW and WC are extremely different
<WhatPayne> Right, hola Violet.... Saw you hugging me earlier.
<EspyLacopa> Warcraft III: Real Time Strategy Game
<Sumica> Val is just mad he cant have a LKxCaramel fix now.
<RobotPinkie> Yet again, I'm without hugs :(
<EspyLacopa> WoW: MMORPG that /eats your soul!!!/
<RobotPinkie> I'm writing a Sea Ponies x Caramel Apple clopfic, currently
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the stream seems to lag a lot for me, is anyone else getting that?
<EspyLacopa> shoo be doo?
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, fund it
<RobotPinkie> (that's a lie,btw)
<WhatPayne> Same here
<prince-dari> Probably internet.
<prince-dari> >_>
<Luna> 07yep

<DecapKing> knew it
<EspyLacopa> Offline
<whiskra> stream off
<VioletVanilla> 6Dari died. . . x.x
<prince-dari> Stream should be back up now.
<Silvermane> :(
<RobotPinkie> Oh lol, I thought you did a ragequit for a sec there
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 he dies
<Pinkie-Pie> Have faith in your superiors Valthejean
<Pinkie-Pie> Or Val the Arch Demon, if you would.
<EspyLacopa> Believe int he Pinkie that believes in you!
<RobotPinkie> I am sometimes seriously tempted to write a bad clopfic about sea ponies, though...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I have faith in no one other than myself
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and woona
<Sumica> Work dem balls
<RobotPinkie> Just to get prince-dari to read it live.
<Sumica> and ded
<Pinkie-Pie> RobotPinkie, im trying to talk to you.
<RobotPinkie> oh lol, sorry
<DecapKing> cause its pie
<DecapKing> thats why Dari
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because one bite and it's wet ;)
<EspyLacopa> Because pie is delicious.
<Sumica> why not get the top right first
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dari....lie? NONSENSE
<Sumica> Dari kinda reminds me of Cave Johnson when he's mad.
<EspyLacopa> Inconceivable!
<WhatPayne> Ohey `Fluttershy is here too
<DecapKing> going down the swear list Dari?
<Sumica> Now dari is listing the words you cant say on tv.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 aaaaaaaand we get a C&D from Dari's swearing :P
<RDash> Hey everypony
<RobotPinkie> Pure skillz, prince-dari
<RDash> Lol, impossible game :P good luck dari
<RobotPinkie> Oh man, that was so close
<Sumica> Still say get the top right one first
<DecapKing> wankstand?
<whiskra> 200 deaths inbound!
<Sumica> *twap twap twap*
<RobotPinkie> HNNNG, anyone know a good way of combatting a depression before S2?
<KanyeEast> watch another great series
<KanyeEast> like doctor who or dexter
<Pinkie-Pie> Read Fanfiction
<Pinkie-Pie> Thats what im doing
<KanyeEast> ^ or that
<EspyLacopa> I really should finish watching Patlabor and Planetes.
<Sumica> and it's onl lv 21
<Silvermane> VioletVanilla, you are more than welcome to stay, and i apprecaite that you were looing out for us
<EspyLacopa> Convince streamers to do LPs? Like Dari is doing right now?
<RobotPinkie> Hmm, I haven't finished catching up on Doctor Who yet
<RobotPinkie> Good idea, thanks KanyeEast
<KanyeEast> which doctor are you on?
<WhatPayne> Hey RobotPinks, checked the Firefly yet?
<KanyeEast> you could watch some old who too
<KanyeEast> like baker's run
<Thing> hey guys quick question
<RobotPinkie> Oh that's right, Firefly!
<KanyeEast> fancy a jelly baby?
<RobotPinkie> ...only I don't have HD space for it right now... crap
<EspyLacopa> Baker's win is partly because of Douglass Adams doing some of the writing.
<Sumica> luck
<Thing> MLP:FiM season 2 is gunna be streamed here live?
<RobotPinkie> I love Tom Baker
<ValtheJean> 2,14 eeyup thing
<KanyeEast> of course it is
<Thing> I don't want to wait a few days before I can watch it
<KanyeEast> including the whole season 1 run up all night long
<WhatPayne> Buy one of those terabytes
*Silvermane glomps VioletVanilla. "No need to leave us, it's okay. We just usually expect worse than that image >.> "
<RobotPinkie> but yeah, Douglas Adams did some very good writing for his Doctor
<Sumica> How dose every one keep finding this out?!
<KanyeEast> i like what moffat is doing with matt smith
<Thing> awesome, screw you England and your stupid failure
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIdDXQ2h1Pc <-- Have some Baker singing.
<Thing> we've only got the first half of season 1!
<KanyeEast> moffat writes some scary stuff
<Sumica> and he one shots it
<KanyeEast> i loved the doctors wife though
<RobotPinkie> haha, that's hilarious, EspyLacopa
<Pinkie-Pie> It goes both ways..?
<RobotPinkie> Gilbert and Sullivan + Doctor Who, oh wow...
<KanyeEast> this is amazing
<Sumica> you still died Dari
<whiskra> lol he took the death on next level
<Sumica> Thing there will be a marathon of s1 before s2 her as well.
<Sumica> here*
<KanyeEast> i have a feeling the time lords will come back with the next doctor's regeneration
<RobotPinkie> That was just... wow
<Sumica> down right pro
<Sumica> and noob death
<WhatPayne> Hey guys I have question to everyone regarding stereotypes which interest me...
<Thing> Sumica That's cool, will the episodes be as jerky as this?
<Thing> keeps stopping and starting slightly
<RobotPinkie> Okay, WhatPayne
<RobotPinkie> Shoot
<Sumica> No this is just dariplaying around he's not streaming the eps.
<KanyeEast> same for me and nah, its a lot smoother
<Thing> awesome
<Sumica> Hi Octavia
<VioletVanilla> 6Octavia!! :3
<WhatPayne> In Finland we (older folks, 20+) have noticed this phenomenon among kids essentially replacing the "cool alcoho drinking" behavior with energy drinks fad.
<KanyeEast> In america we combined the two
<KanyeEast> and called it four loko
<Octavia> 13Hey
<WhatPayne> Something which we call being "Jonne"
<Sumica> yeah was gonna say that Kabaka
<Sumica> er KanyeEast
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ohai tavi
<Kabaka> Sumica: oh hi
<RobotPinkie> ohay Octavia
<WhatPayne> And I wonder if you have these hyper active kids drinking energy drinks like water?
<KanyeEast> As a college person I can only speculate on littler kids but here at uni many people do drink energy drinks
*Dermathil waves at the arriving people
<KanyeEast> nos>monster>anything else
<WhatPayne> It's not just drinking per say (I mean I drink energy drinks)
<KanyeEast> but not like water, they really dehydrate you and I can only drink one at day or so
<prince-dari> MFW I've already passed the level.
<prince-dari> But stream is so laggy. XD
<prince-dari> God dammit Virgin.
<EspyLacopa> Wow, that must make me really weird what with only drinking water.
<RobotPinkie> Any House MD tonight, Luna?
<Sumica> Must be like 5 min of lag then
<WhatPayne> But it's this parents say "energy drinks are bad and should be banned from under 15 year old"
<KanyeEast> yeah well they ARE bad for you
<WhatPayne> And the kids do exact opposite
<prince-dari> I'll put quality at lowest because Vrigin hates me. >_>
<Dermathil> wat, Virgin is playing tricks on you? I thought they were a good ISP
<EspyLacopa> Energy Drinks are for upper end athletes aren't they?
<KanyeEast> or for people who have late night papers to write
<Dermathil> nope
<WhatPayne> Like kids normally do... But as a side effect the alcohol drinking amongst young teens has dropped
<prince-dari> Virgin's internet is usually pretty good but the speed sometimes derps massively.
<WhatPayne> Replaced by energy drinks...
<KanyeEast> red hot chilli peppers + can of monster = paper gets done
<RobotPinkie> And yeah, WhatPayne, Sweden adopted a law forbidding the sale of energy drinks to people under 18
<RobotPinkie> It was apparently that bad
<KanyeEast> if thats true though, then I think thats a good thing. Energy drinks are less worse for you than alcohol
<Dermathil> So, valthejean, what did you think of the interview? What did you think about the teases he did?
<KanyeEast> the interview was amazing
<KanyeEast> nice to see they actually care about what they do
<Dermathil> heheheheeh
<Sumica> streemception time.
<RobotPinkie> Oh you finished listening to the Thiessen interview?
<RobotPinkie> awesome
<EspyLacopa> It likely helps that energy drinks don't require an ID to buy.
<Dermathil> "We've got bronies in the studio"
<WhatPayne> KanyeEast Ttue
<CAJ> ok so bronystate.com or whatever is teh place where they're streamin the episodes?
<WhatPayne> *true
<RobotPinkie> That interview seriously made me giddy inside
<KanyeEast> apparently they all pass around fanfics and art to each other that they like
<Dermathil> Bronystate.net, CAJ
<CAJ> well yeah that's what i meant
<Dermathil> KanyeEast, it seemed to be more implied to be fanart and PMVs rather than Fanfics. Due to the content.
<KanyeEast> thats true, all sorts of legal snaggles if they started using anything like ideas
<Dermathil> exactly.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I think fanfics are barred on the FiM team
<WhatPayne> Hold on I'll try to find picture which perfectly embodies what I'm talking about
<KanyeEast> so sadly luna will probably not have an abacus
<Dermathil> Yeah. Because that could bring all of the Intellectual Property stuff on the board. Meaning Shit hitting the fan usually.
<RobotPinkie> and I love that Thiessen loves the image memes
*Silvermane glomps Octavia. "Hello most beautiful of 6-best ponies"
<Dermathil> Luna?
<Dermathil> Will there be House MD today?
*Dermathil waves at NewDCD
<DecapKing> Hey Octavia
<KanyeEast> you know, i've always wondered what it would be like if hugh laurie became the next doctor
<VioletVanilla> 6They are, Rainbow Dash.
<RobotPinkie> LAWL
<EspyLacopa> Just think Dari, in a few hours the sun will rise.
<Octavia> 13lol Hey Silvermane and DecapKing :P
<RobotPinkie> That would be pretty funny, if nothing else, KanyeEast
*DecapKing glomps Octavia
<Silvermane> EspyLacopa, what in the fuck does that even mean? Huh?
*Octavia 13is dead exhausted
<EspyLacopa> ^_^
*ValtheJean hugs octavia
<RobotPinkie> Though I think canonically the Doctor keeps getting younger with each incarnation
<Silvermane> (lol ILU YGO:TAS)
*DecapKing gives Octavia caffeine
<KanyeEast> thats true, pretty soon he'll be justin bieber
<EspyLacopa> inb4 teenage angsty Doctor
*CAJ hugs hekeshi
<Octavia> 13Hehe <3
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there is only one person I consider worse than Justin Bieber
<RobotPinkie> Robert Pattinson as next Doctor PLZ
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but I am waiting for the right time to introduce him to you all :P
<KanyeEast> is he ginger?
*VioletVanilla gives Octavia chocolate~
<RobotPinkie> then both prince-dari and I will commit suicide
<Octavia> 13Justin Bieber, ewwww
<EspyLacopa> ZUN made it?
*Octavia 13cant have chocolate :(
<KanyeEast> luckily robert pattinson isn't british
<KanyeEast> so he can't be the doctor
<RobotPinkie> He can do a fake British accent that will make everyone cringe, I'm sure
<RobotPinkie> as can I, btw
<RobotPinkie> I should be the next Doctor
<KanyeEast> daniel radcliff as next doctor
<RobotPinkie> He's too famous and expensive
<KanyeEast> and too harry potter
<RobotPinkie> Yeah...
<KanyeEast> the 12th doctor will probably have red hair
<KanyeEast> all the "i want to be ginger" comments
<RobotPinkie> Oh wow
<LordCelestia> REGISTER
<VioletVanilla> 6Sorry Dari D;
<RobotPinkie> Tim Minchin should be the next Doctor http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVN_0qvuhhw
<RobotPinkie> SERIOUSLY
<RobotPinkie> just watch that, and tell me he shouldn't be the Doctor :P
<EspyLacopa> Tim Currey as the 12th Doctor?
<KanyeEast> I can see it pinkie
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Espy: FUND IT
<SillyFilly> Hehe, i know that problem
<RobotPinkie> I <3 Tim Minchin
<KanyeEast> Alan Rickman for doctor
<EspyLacopa> He's even properly british.
<LordCelestia> yay im registered on here now
<SillyFilly> just set your status to occupied, problem solved
<RobotPinkie> Yeah Tim Minchin is from Oz
<RobotPinkie> unfortunately
<LordCelestia> suspense!
<KanyeEast> he's got the crazy eyes going too
<Thing> bets he's gunna screw up?
<EspyLacopa> Watch, Dari'll get killed by the purple ball right before getting back to the goal.
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Ej9-q0dqU&feature=related

<LordCelestia> i gotta go, bye
<RobotPinkie> night LordCelestia
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie how's the energy drinks + kids in Sweden?
<KanyeEast> so they actually banned energy drinks in sweden? thats pretty hardcore
<WhatPayne> cya
<KanyeEast> people got pissed about the four loko thing in the U.S. and it was killing people
<RobotPinkie> Well they have only stopped stores from selling them to kids, KanyeEast
<RobotPinkie> I can still drink them :P
<WhatPayne> I believe they has not been banned per say. But the cashiers have been instructed not to sell them to kids under 15 here
<KanyeEast> ah, i've seen a few shops that didn't let kids buy them
<EspyLacopa> Oh no, Dari, you'll have to do *6* times
<KanyeEast> kids under 15 really have no reason to drink energy drinks anyway
<RobotPinkie> Here I believe it's illegal for stores to sell them to kids under 18
<WhatPayne> KanyeEast Where do you live?
<RobotPinkie> same treatment as cigarettes
<Sumica> Now do it again
<KanyeEast> North Carolina, its mostly been at summer camps and places with lots of kids
<EspyLacopa> Only now he can't hug the walls while doing so.
<RobotPinkie> Can I get a hug instead of the walls? I'm jelly
<WhatPayne> I believe the "ban" here has only encouraged kids to acquire them
*EspyLacopa hugs RobotPinkie
<KanyeEast> did anyone see the mlp review that went up on thatguywiththeglasses?
*WhatPayne hugs RobotPinkie
*RobotPinkie hugs back. "Thanks guys"
<Ghosties> Oh, cool, KanyeEast lives in NC
<WhatPayne> What goes around comes around. Even hugs
*VioletVanilla hugs RobotPinkie~
<RobotPinkie> ohay Ghosties
<Sumica> it was that one right there.
<KanyeEast> yup, i'm only here for college though
<Ghosties> *waves*
*RobotPinkie hugs VioletVanilla back :3
<VioletVanilla> 6THE BALLS ARE INERT DARI!
<KanyeEast> so I know nothing about this state besides thinking all the accents are funny
<Sumica> lol VV
<Ghosties> prince-dari, you fail at this
<WhatPayne> KanyeEast: So it's like a thing where some kid always sneaks energy drinks to camp area?
<prince-dari> XD Ghosties
<prince-dari> You do it. :P
<WhatPayne> There's MLP review in TGWTG?
<KanyeEast> nah, all I saw was signs up that said "kids from x camp can't buy energy drinks"
<KanyeEast> http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/cr/ff/32418-episode-57-my-little-pony-retrospective-part-1
<Ghosties> I don't wanna do it. I'm busy playing Deus Ex Human Revolution
<KanyeEast> CR apparently is a hardcore brony
<KanyeEast> even watching it in the 1980's when it wasn't cool
<EspyLacopa> http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/blogs/latest/entry/dsott-3-my-little-pony-fim
<Silvermane> oh wow Dari is on level 28
<WhatPayne> That MLP is pre G4?
<Silvermane> i think that looks like 3.5
<KanyeEast> I think he'll do a "why fim is awesome" part 2 later in the week
<WhatPayne> Never mind, Just watching it
<KanyeEast> but he does a lead up to it
<KanyeEast> whose the villian in the mlp movie we're watching on friday?
<WhatPayne> He just said he's doing that in the beginning of the video
<EspyLacopa> THE SMOOZE!
<EspyLacopa> A shoggoth.
<KanyeEast> oh god, and I sort of wanted to see tirac
<KanyeEast> but shoggoths are cool too
<WhatPayne> You know Nostalgia Chick did MLP review before FIM came out. It's pretty good.
<RobotPinkie> Watching the MLP review, lol
<WhatPayne> ^
<KanyeEast> I never realized how awful 3.0 and 3.5 were
<MrChang> ahhh kayne
<MrChang> why aren't you coming?
<KanyeEast> got a meeting with a project group in the library in about half an hour
<MrChang> bawww
<MrChang> bring your laptop there lol
<WhatPayne> Hey this review is pretty good
<RobotPinkie> taking long to load :(
<VioletVanilla> 6You can do it Dari!!
<KanyeEast> I doubt they'll appreciate my reasoning of "i'm roleplaying a pony and fighting skelatons" as a excuse
*VioletVanilla cheers for Dari~
<MrChang> i planned a boss fight and everything
<MrChang> aw
<MrChang> maybe trm
*VioletVanilla giggles~
<MrChang> if there arent enough, we'll do it trm
*Silvermane loves Prince-Dari "Go GO sexy voice, go go sexy voice"
<VioletVanilla> 6You will do it within 500!
<KanyeEast> You can go on without Samule Jackson, i'm sure.
<WhatPayne> lol @ Katrina
<MrChang> i dont want to spoil it
<Ghosties> @Violet: No, he won't
<MrChang> but the boss fight is going to be demonic
<VioletVanilla> 650!

<RobotPinkie> Man y so so slow to load TGWTG.com?
<KanyeEast> because everyone is watching the pony review, duh
<Silvermane> i think it may be the Diablo 3 ponies
<WhatPayne> I have no troubles
<VioletVanilla> 6Dari's mind is TwilightJelly
<Sumica> MIght show you later dari.
<VioletVanilla> 6DERPY!!! <#
<VioletVanilla> 6DERPY!!! <3*
<WhatPayne> winking out?
<Derpy_Hooves> Hello. :3
*VioletVanilla ponypounces Derpy_Hooves
*GrimGallop appears
<WhatPayne> People of englands, is winking out some dirty double entendre?
<KanyeEast> it sounded dirty to me
<KanyeEast> and i'm not one of those englandertypes
<WhatPayne> USA - Close enough
<WhatPayne> EW!
<GrimGallop> My latest e-mail from ThinkGeek is titled "ThinkGeek launches 32 items (but not to the moon)‏"
<Sumica> Oh god he's doing all the genorations?
<GrimGallop> I lolled
<WhatPayne> Urban dictionary explains
<KanyeEast> yup
<WhatPayne> It was quite dirtier than what I first thought
<VioletVanilla> 6DAWN OF THE THIRD DAY
<VioletVanilla> 624 HOURS REMAINING
<VioletVanilla> 6 24 HOURS REMAINING
<WhatPayne> Someone here should air this review
<WhatPayne> I mean stream
<GrimGallop> No, /this/ is joking...
<Sumica> Indeed WhatPayne
<RobotPinkie> If you know who Jonathan Ross is, watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt-lotqZQsc
<GrimGallop> How many half-elves does it take to screw in a light bulb?
<Sumica> But then Dari would learn of that clip.
*EspyLacopa cutting up ze onion and celerry for tasty meatloaf
*Dermathil just watched Totalbiscuit's WTF is Space Marine Multiplayer
<VioletVanilla> 6Somepony should send this to Retsuprae~
<Ghosties> Huh, he made it
<mib_h9p941> o.o
<mib_h9p941> o.o
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I believe dari's sound is gone
<Sumica> I am sure you will find it and show it all the time once you do Dari.
<Ghosties> Why?
<GrimGallop> If this room had a swear jar... :P
<Flutteryay> I'd like to put a swear into the swear jar.
<Flutteryay> ASS!
<GrimGallop> Like it's been doing the whole time? XD
<WhatPayne> Oh, my, god... New Born Ponies
<EspyLacopa> Wee, cutting up onions.
<GrimGallop> You need training from Piccolo if you want to get better at dodging things
<KanyeEast> DODGE
<EspyLacopa> DOOOOOOODGE!
<Sumica> Oh god i just got to that part WhatPayne
<KanyeEast> How many namekians does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
<Pinkie-Pie> Your still playing this Prince-Dari?!
<Sumica> and it's the thing they tortured us with on friday.
<GrimGallop> None, because they're all dead.
<WhatPayne> ...Regardless, that was really good review
<KanyeEast> Freiza is my favorite part of the second season of dbz abridged
<VioletVanilla> 6I think I hear the gears in Dari's head grinding. . . o.o
<WhatPayne> Oh Littlekuriboh voices Frieza in DBZ abridged
<Sumica> Oh god he listed the clips in the credits. We are doomed.
<KanyeEast> mainly because of how evil little kuriboh is at being a villian
<Flutteryay> Jesus fuck, I just got out of a Skype conversation with a guy who claimed that he knows a writer for Season 2 and they said they're getting rid of a minor character permanently
<Flutteryay> What an idiot
<Flutteryay> Either he's the most gullible boy alive or he thinks I'm gullible.
<KanyeEast> or he's trolling you
<Sumica> when in doubt, Yes Flutteryay
<KanyeEast> or they'll do a very special episode where someone gets cancer
<Flutteryay> He implied it would be Derpy or Luna
<Flutteryay> lol
<Flutteryay> bs
<Pinkie-Pie> Burn him by the stake.
<EspyLacopa> come to me, delicious ground beef. . .
<Flutteryay> He also said that he thinks Season 2 will be bad.
<KanyeEast> luna would have to be in more episodes to count as a 'minor character'
<GrimGallop> Blasphemer
<WhatPayne> What. I call bs. Derpy and Luna are the top two fan favorite minor characters
<KanyeEast> 2 lines and 30 seconds of screen time do not a minor character make
<Sumica> At this point I would still class Luna as a plotdevice.
<WhatPayne> But we know both Luna and Derpy will come back
<Flutteryay> Wait he said background character
<Flutteryay> but still I call BS
<WhatPayne> ^
<Flutteryay> I asked him who the writer was and he said he couldn't remember his name
<Flutteryay> lol
<VioletVanilla> 6This MUSIC is killing me . .. x.x
<Sumica> jeas if you are gonna make up a story at least take a moment to reply while you google a writer name.
<WhatPayne> And hasn't that rumor been around since the announcement of season 2 that some character will be gotten rid of.
<Ghosties> Dari, just give it up
<Ghosties> You're not gonna win
<Sumica> 715,716,717,718,719
<Flutteryay> I for one will not believe it until I se it or it comes straight from the horse's mouth
<Ghosties> If you can win before a 1,000 deaths, I'll be impressed
<WhatPayne> In mean while.... There's that Nostalgia Chick's review of MLP
<WhatPayne> http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/team-nchick/nostalgia-chick/17773-my-little-pony
<WhatPayne> For those interested
<Flutteryay> Oh it all makes sense now. He legitly believes Applejack is his waifu
<Flutteryay> He called Apple Bloom his sister-in-law
<Sumica> ....
<KanyeEast> some people
*KanyeEast shakes head
*Flutteryay wsmh smh smh
<KanyeEast> you got that fluttershy realdoll yet?
<WhatPayne> :D
<Flutteryay> Hi Luna!
<WhatPayne> KanyeEast I love those vids
<Sumica> Oh hi luna
<KanyeEast> guys, I want a girlfriend who likes ponies. how do?
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<KanyeEast> and those are the only appropriate comments
<RobotPinkie> My girlfriend likes ponies.
*Luna waves at everypony
<KanyeEast> lucky
<RobotPinkie> Not nearly as much as I do, but she thought it was a fun show
<RobotPinkie> Well, unlucky because she's half the world away for another year :P
<WhatPayne> I would hug a pony non-sexually
*VioletVanilla waves at Luna~
<KanyeEast> Ha ha, time for ponies!
<RobotPinkie> I would hug a pony
<AllisZero> Hi Luna!
<WhatPayne> Pony should pony pony
<Flutteryay> [9/14/11 4:05:28 PM] Ronnie Eury: i <3 my problems

<Flutteryay> [9/14/11 4:06:08 PM] Ronnie Eury: i don't think of them as problems i think of them as gifts :3
<Flutteryay> [9/14/11 4:06:17 PM] Flutteryay: yeah
<Flutteryay> [9/14/11 4:06:48 PM] Ronnie Eury: i wonder how many bronies wish they had my gifts :3
<Flutteryay> [9/14/11 4:09:00 PM] Flutteryay: I'd like to be a tree.
<RobotPinkie> Ponyally
*Watercress peers in.

<Razyn> Oh, this again. You are just masochistic
<WhatPayne> Fat pony you say?
<EspyLacopa> Righto, switching computers again
<Razyn> So is that "Bronystate" logo gonna be there all of the time?
<WhatPayne> Running out of SFW quotes
<Sumica> Yeah Razyn
<Razyn> It's just as well, I suppose
<whiskra> im trying tihs game now for the first time, level 15 and 607 deaths >_>
<Octavia> 13We kinda like it :>
<Razyn> I was just curious
<KanyeEast> my favorite part was the office clip
<Pinkie-Pie> I cant believe you are still doing this Prince-Dari
<Pinkie-Pie> I salute your determination
<Pinkie-Pie> XD
<EspyLacopa> Don't worry, he's still got one more level after this.
<Octavia> 13Yeah, hes pretty determined :P
<Flutteryay> He's the Determinator!
<RDash> Anypony else's stream freeze?
<WhatPayne> Yes

<Ziltoid> Hey brownies
<WhatPayne> hellew
<Razyn> Brownies? Where?
<RDash> Hey Ziltoid
<WhatPayne> We're not pastries tho
<Sumica> after seeing this review, I am glad I am working friday night.
<WhatPayne> Which review?
<Ziltoid> Why is dari still playing this game
<Octavia> 13Dont be such a prude Pinkie Pie!
<Sumica> Nolstlgachick.
<Razyn> Watching you die over and over reminds me of Oddworld. Except Oddworld has mildly amusing dialogue.
<WhatPayne> Right... Why is that Sumica?
<Sumica> the b movie on friday. is the MLP movie
<Ziltoid> Why is audio borked
<WhatPayne> Oh, oh, ohh....
<WhatPayne> Dammit
<Ziltoid> Where the hell is the question mark on this damn keyboard
<Octavia> 13I usedto love that movie when I was little
<Sumica> http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/team-nchick/nostalgia-chick/17773-my-little-pony
<WhatPayne> But the nchick review was pretty good too.
<WhatPayne> ^^ that one
<RobotPinkie> I'm hoping Nostalgia Chick does a review of FiM eventually
<Sumica> the review was fin I just dont think I could stand the movie.
<WhatPayne> Same here
<RobotPinkie> or well, I'd like to see one from Nostalgia Critic too
<RobotPinkie> but that's not gonna happen
<Thing> what?
<Thing> did the dude just go crazy?
<Octavia> 13As far as the old gens of MLP go, the MLP Movie wasn't too bad overall.
<WhatPayne> I don't know. FIM is something completely different from what we have seen before
<VioletVanilla> 6Oh you will all see the MLP movie this Friday ;D
*Octavia 13has already seen it a million times lol
<RobotPinkie> Nothing with Tony Randall could possibly be very bad, Octavia
<Octavia> 13The liked the witch sisters in it, they were really the main characters over the ponies.
<RobotPinkie> He's like... my hero
<KanyeEast> I get the impression that in the old show none of the ponies had personalities
<Octavia> 13Not really.
<WhatPayne> Is it just me or does people not belong to MLP?
<Apokalipse> Hello Bronystate!
<Octavia> 13By todays standards, they were rather bland.
<WhatPayne> hiya
<Apokalipse> That's a lot of OP's
<Sumica> She brought up a good point thought, Who was the protagnist?
<RobotPinkie> If you haven't, watch this movie... then realize that he's Moochick http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057812/
<WhatPayne> Who was the phone?
<Octavia> 13Yeah, starting to get a lot of new mods. lol
<Ziltoid> @±£\£¢¤¬¦¬¦²²³¼½¾
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<WhatPayne> New mods?
<Octavia> 13Mhm

<Turgle> dari is collapsing
<Octavia> 13Only newer one we have online atm it seems is Violet :P
<Razyn> inb4 over nine hundred deaths
<Apokalipse> Come on dari, only 866 deaths so far...
<Sumica> Dear princess celstia, today i learned that purple balls are deadly.
<WhatPayne> Yes. But people who frequent here already know our lovely Violet
<Ziltoid> Glasses are witchcraft
<RobotPinkie> >mfw I found out Joel Hodgson's favorite movie was 7 Faces of Dr Lao http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkm51fE68X1qiq96ko1_250.gif
<WhatPayne> There's the blue balls joke
<Octavia> 13I didnt say they didnt already know her. :P
<WhatPayne> point
<Ziltoid> @pony
<Ziltoid> daw
<Octavia> 13But shes still one of our newer mods.
<WhatPayne> Indeed she is.
<Octavia> 13Also, Dari is never going to beat this level. Evar. lol
<Ziltoid> Dari is bad at video games
<Turgle> never ever
<Sumica> FOREEEEEVER!
<Octavia> 13Ooooh, got kinda close there

<Apokalipse> I still think of anyone other than dari, DCD, Hipster, ghosties and sprinkles as new mods :p
<Sumica> *twap*
<WhatPayne> Btw. Will Violet at some point turn up in the "About Us" page?
<Octavia> 13I think of your ass as a new mod
<RDash> Ziltoid You've never played this game then :P
<NewDCD> 9that was a pretty nice attempt
<NewDCD> 9Apokalipse you forgot Luna
<DecapKnight> hey Octavia

<DecapKnight> how many deaths is he at?
<RDash> 896

<Turgle> 899

<Ziltoid> dat flank
<WhatPayne> 904? my stream was behind
<Silvermane> Twilight blushed a bright crimson, revving up her motors to attempt to outpace Trixieberg. It was no use. "Leave my aft out of this!" she protested.
<Silvermane> Trixieberg just laughed as she banked sharply to push Twilight out the way, knocking the little blimp into a spin. "Come on Twilight!" she mocked. "Trixieberg waits for no blimp!"
<whiskra> becaus he's been at it for hours and only got 2 levels left?
<Ziltoid> lol silvermane
<Ziltoid> wrong channel?
<Thing> by the time he beats this, he will be god of gaming
<Apokalipse> Is this the first game or the second?
<Apokalipse> Because I think there's two
<Silvermane> nope, not at all Ziltoid
<Ziltoid> Who is trixieburg?
<WhatPayne> This is just painful to watch
<KanyeEast> You know what i'm listening to? one more time

<Razyn> I woke up today, and the words, "Dawn of the First Day" echoed in my head. It freaked me out.
*Thunder_Dash plays the Song of Double Time
<WhatPayne> Why is that?
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah!
<Ziltoid> You dont like the piratews theme?
<Ziltoid> IMPOSSIBARU
<RobotPinkie> That's less than three days to pony

*Razyn joins in the Double Time Song
<Turgle> i don't like that version :|

<SillyFilly> wow, this is madness :<
<Silverscreen> Allo.

*Silverscreen 11cues holy chorus.
<Zephirdd> LMAO
<Thunder_Dash> Holy--
<WhatPayne> haha
<GrimGallop> What.
<whiskra> riiiiiight....
<Apokalipse> dat pattern...
<RDash> Tip: The following level is impossible :P
<RDash> XD
<Thunder_Dash> inb4 >100 deaths
<Sumica> Beware, beware.
<RDash> lol
<Thunder_Dash> Ninja cube
<RDash> Hiding
<Zephirdd> they have a set path
<whiskra> i bet this level really IS impossible
<Zephirdd> but each of them has a different pattern
<Sumica> and you have to get back to the start.
<Thunder_Dash> the middle one goes back and forth, the other four circle around it seems
<whiskra> is it possible to enter the same green area where you start to finish the level?
<GrimGallop> Two of them are going around the outside, two are going around the inside, and one's going back and forth around the middle
<Sumica> 2 on the out two mid and one center
<Razyn> Dari is flipping his shit
<Thunder_Dash> whiskra; I think that's what he has to do once he's got all the golden spheres or whatever they are
<Razyn> Tripping so hard
<RDash> whiskra Depends on the level. This one, yes
<Zephirdd> yes whiskra
<GrimGallop> Very carefully.
<Thunder_Dash> turn on your ninja cube skills, dari
<Sumica> and after this he dose it again on normal diffaculty.
<whiskra> theres so many times when playing this game that you wish the cube moved faster
<WhatPayne> Am I seeing right or is there a small spot where the five cubes does not hit? On the right side of where the middle one stops
<whiskra> and some times when it moves too fast
<Sumica> dose look that way WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> Slow ones hit that spot
<WhatPayne> Yeah
<Sumica> ninja slow balls
<Thunder_Dash> What's this game called again? I forget
<Sumica> You cant win i think
<whiskra> it says in the corner
<RDash> Thunder_Dash The impossible game I think
<RDash> Err.. No "I think"
<WhatPayne> Wait there is similar spot on the left side too
<whiskra> speaking of impossible game, anyone remember that web browser thing notpron?
<WhatPayne> I think...
<Pinkie-Pie> Prince-Dari, boy have I got a nice suprise for you: http://www.addictinggames.com/puzzle-games/theimpossiblequiz2.jsp

<RDash> lol, 46 levels left Dari
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> It's worth the download Dari
<Turgle> DAMNIT
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> I really, REALLY want to see how pissed IWBTG makes you :3
<Thunder_Dash> JANET
<TheJanitor> The Dari Dammit Show

<Apokalipse> DAMNIT JANET
<Sumica> Damnit *drink* damnit *drink*
<Turgle> xD
<WhatPayne> Please, no. This is unbearable
<Sumica> if he had a controler he would be throwing it at the game.
<Thunder_Dash> in b4 the second last level of this one beats it?
<randomguy5203> in b4 first 10 seconds of IWbTG beats it.
<Sumica> Thunder_Dash, is quite the optmist.
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> IWBTG First level > HGE last level
<Thunder_Dash> Oh boy...
<randomguy5203> oh god lol..
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> YEEEEES
<RobotPinkie> I'd rather see him play like... a good game
<Pinkie-Pie> BE THE GUY
<RobotPinkie> as opposed to a game that's only redeeming merit is being balls hard :P
<randomguy5203> really really
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> It is quite literally at least twice as hard as any other game.
<Thunder_Dash> it's like a Mega Man game times ten
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> DO IT FILLY
<randomguy5203> you poor, poor person.
<Thunder_Dash> it works fine for me
<Turgle> meanwhile... robot unicorn attack
<Sumica> Sorry seem we will have to give up on friday's movies dari is gonna be at this for some time =p
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Not getting off THAT easily, Dari
<RobotPinkie> Play Durrrrrrrrrrgarrrrrrrrrrr or something instead :P
<WhatPayne> Could we watch something?
<randomguy5203> your internet hates you, man
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Payne, we are going to watch pure rage
<RDash> Turgle Rainbow Dash attack > Robot Unicorn Attack
<whiskra> OH its one of those games...
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> pure anadulterated rage
<whiskra> trial and error basically from what I can see
<WhatPayne> Yeah... I dunno about that.
<Turgle> RDash, yes but there are a few bugs
<randomguy5203> go look up one of the LP's of IWbTG
<randomguy5203> there are outtakes which are nothing but the word "F**K" repeated like a mantra.
<Sumica> Sup DCD
<NewDCD> 9just here
<Kevlarmoses> Hello DCD.
<RDash> Oh really? I haven't found any. I've probably just not gotten far enough.
<Thunder_Dash> Oh, it is.
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> SO MUCH WORSE.
<River_Tam> it is.
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> It is Battletoads X 10
<WhatPayne> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhl9pJB-2Ak Battletoads
<Sumica> oh god battle toads.
<randomguy5203> you're about to see.
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> SO MUCH WORSE.
<RDash> The one on EqD is really laggy though, derpyhooves.com is fine
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Everything kills you.
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Everything.
<randomguy5203> the very level itself hates you
<Thunder_Dash> Saying that IWBTG is hard is like saying that getting hit by a train is slightly painful
<RobotPinkie> In other words: It's a shit game :P
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> What Thunder said
<whiskra> it looks like an trial and error platformer where you can only progress by dying to everything
<randomguy5203> pretty much, yeah
<Turgle> dude
<Turgle> i hate that guy at right
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> And then after you die to everything, you still need perfect timing to dodge it.
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Turgle
<Turgle> We're Always Watching
<Turgle> WTF
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> He's always watching

<randomguy5203> Spoilery spoilers.
<herospirit> I'm bouncing in anticipation of Dari's IWBTG play.
<RobotPinkie> hello?
<randomguy5203> I'm just giggling like a loon hero
<Sumica> I dont know of any spoilers in it as i have not heard it. But every one keeps spouting it has "spoilers" in it.
<herospirit> The farthest I've ever gotten was the 5th screen I believe
<WhatPayne> Are we supposed to listen something?
<RobotPinkie> @Steven_Magnetmeter Chat
<RobotPinkie> Seems pretty accurate.
<herospirit> What does? It didn't appear for me
<whiskra> well, that clip wasnt SOOO spoilerific... for one who saw the last clip
<herospirit> @Pantsmeter
<randomguy5203> Plus install time.

<Thunder_Dash> > implying you can win IWBTG in the first place
<Sumica> You failed the first level Dari
<herospirit> Try again :0
<RobotPinkie> The only winning move is not to play!
<Turgle> DAT GUY
<Turgle> WTF
<randomguy5203> >implying that isn't a win
<herospirit> It's.... not supposed to do that
<Turgle> man
<River_Tam> The only way to win is not to play.
<Turgle> he's horrible
<randomguy5203> maybe try a compatibility mode if it keeps crashing?
<herospirit> You'll see a lot of the splatter.
<herospirit> :0

<Sumica> Heatseaking apples
<CyberToyny> XDD
<Turgle> ROFL
<Thunder_Dash> You weren't far enough to the right
<randomguy5203> Because the game hates you.

<randomguy5203> lol
<RyanRodriguez> Hey, I'm back with more Questions... Sorry.
<Pinkie-Pie> Are you having fun Prince-Dari?
<Turgle> dari <3
<Pinkie-Pie> Lol
<RobotPinkie> Well, I'm off for the night.
<RobotPinkie> Night night everypony
<randomguy5203> So we've made it to screen two
<Turgle> bye RobotPinkie :)
<Thunder_Dash> See ya, RobotPinkie
<Pinkie-Pie> Goodnight RobotPinkie
<randomguy5203> progress is above expected levels
<RyanRodriguez> Anyway, while it's streaming, will S2E1 be recorded, in case there's a delay?
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari, We Love you! If it's too hard, Durrgann is waiting forever and always
<herospirit> Hatred is the natural emotion for someone playing IWBTG
<herospirit> You are on screen 2 of about 70
<randomguy5203> If you want to really feel despair, go find a map of the game
<randomguy5203> Not to mention the bosses
<herospirit> I never even made it to a boss :0
<CyberToyny> :P
<randomguy5203> I forget, can gravity kill you in this game?
<RyanRodriguez> Hello...?
<CyberToyny> but wait, it gets better :3
<herospirit> Apparently not randomgut
<TheJanitor> That's ok, he hasn't reached the part where the MOON falls on him yet.
<herospirit> guy*
<randomguy5203> HAHAHA|
<RyanRodriguez> Will you or will you not be recording the stream?
<Turgle> AHAHAHAHHAHA
<randomguy5203> "Clouds can't kill you".
<Turgle> stupid clouds
<TheJanitor> Yes, you shoot bosses.
<Thunder_Dash> the save blocks... well, save the game when you shoot them
<Thunder_Dash> OH MY GOD, THIS ROOM.
<herospirit> Save point over there.
<Sumica> RyanRodriguez I belive it will be recorrded. keep in mind the eps is rebrodcast again right after.
<Solarboy> DOuble jump and shoot
<Solarboy> hit the save point
<Turgle> go man
<randomguy5203> shoot the yellow thing when you get near.
<RyanRodriguez> Thanks, Sumica!
<River_Tam> They don't disappear.
<SillyFilly> don't do it :C
<herospirit> Stupid wall
<Solarboy> Oh, you can't :v
<RyanRodriguez> I was not aware of there being any intentions of immediate re-broadcasting.
<Turgle> kick those apples!
<herospirit> You should have done easy mode. Save points on every screen.
<Apokalipse> This is what happens if you don't applebuck regularly...
<herospirit> Of course, it also makes you wear a pink bow, but...
<Sumica> check the HUB's gude at http://www.hubworld.com/tv-schedule
<Sumica> ep 201 is being shown twice in a row.
<RyanRodriguez> Alright. Thanks again, Sumica!
<River_Tam> Famous last words.
<Dermathil> >mfw Prince-dari it trying to be the guy.
<herospirit> Dari > Apples
<Dermathil> lawl
<randomguy5203> Nope. No joking here
<Purple`Prose> XD
<Apokalipse> ahahaha
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<herospirit> Trololololol
<CyberToyny> easy mode it XDD
<Turgle> ahahahahha
<Turgle> do it in easy mode, dari!
<randomguy5203> mwahahha.
<Dermathil> DON't easymode
<Thunder_Dash> IIRC, you have to jump on it, quickly run off the right side, and use your air-jump to get to the bottom left one
<Sumica> and now you know why the drills are moving
<RyanRodriguez> Cheerio!
<CyberToyny> *Jedi* You ~want~ the save points
<herospirit> Why not easy mode?
<herospirit> Is there something I don't know, Derm?
<TheJanitor> If it's worth doing, it's worth doing it HARDCORE!
<Turgle> because of easy
<randomguy5203> apparently they like rage?
<Dermathil> Easymode puts additional save blocks. Sometimes you can save and get stuck in an endless loop.
<Sumica> it's amazing this kid made it to the age of 15
<Turgle> xD
<randomguy5203> you can turn that off, you know.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol you still playing games dari? :P
<herospirit> You can change the controls
<RandomExtra> IWBTG?! How much have I missed?
<Pinkie-Pie> You can turn sticky keys off
<Thunder_Dash> The bottom-left one?
<herospirit> Not much Extra
<Purple`Prose> You have to jump off the cloud going up and double jump
<Dermathil> jump on the lifting one, then jump right back down before you hit the spikes
<TheJanitor> Double jump!
<Dermathil> then double jump
<Dermathil> Purple Prose knows too
<Dermathil> yes it is
<Purple`Prose> you jump to the right
<RandomExtra> Walk off the edge of the lifting one.
<Thunder_Dash> It's possible, just... annoying
<randomguy5203> jump on the very edge, then run off
<Turgle> yay
<Sumica> and you made it so farr...oh wait.
<Dermathil> Dari, this is easy peasy in comparison to the latter stages
<CyberToyny> FFFUUUUUUUhhhh
<randomguy5203> No.
<herospirit> Nyope.
<herospirit> Stupid fabric
<CyberToyny> Ctrl + Alt + Del
<GrimGallop> This game hates you.
<WhatPayne> Dumb game
<CyberToyny> task manager and force dat shit to end
<randomguy5203> Don't worry. IWBtG hates you too.
<Turgle> kill it with fire
<TheJanitor> Dari, you have any console games that would be fun to watch you play?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dari should get WC3 :P
<WhatPayne> Why not play "Reimagine :The Game"?
<randomguy5203> Do you have Minecraft?
<WhatPayne> There's that FIM reference
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol...minecraft is NOT fun to watch :P
<Dermathil> MINECRAFT
<TheJanitor> Beware the enderman.
<Thunder_Dash> inb4 Enderman/Weeping Angels jokes?
<randomguy5203> Fair enough.
<Dermathil> valthejean, it is when you are a fan. You can get ideas for new structures and the like
<LordCelestia> ok
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, I'd rather just see the finished product
<Dermathil> OR, they make a series like the yogscast where its all adventure.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 since watching a guy whack a brick for 4 hours isn't fun to me
<Turgle> we're sill all watching
<LordCelestia> Hey guys, check this out : http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d49u6y2 it should be an IDEAS list
<LordCelestia> if any of you seen it before
<CyberToyny> alright lets do dis again, easy mode nao XD
<Dermathil> another fun part of minecraft, val, is that you see how the guy builds the stuff, what tricks he uses to speed up production, etc
<CyberToyny> save points, save points everywhere
<GrimGallop> Who's saying MineCraft's not fun to watch? D:
<Apokalipse> I like watching minecraft...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that would be me
<Dermathil> Valthejean
<Pinkie-Pie> Dari, play Terraria
<WhatPayne> Reimagine :The Game: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/569281
<Pinkie-Pie> XD
<CyberToyny> its better to play
<Apokalipse> And I don't even play it
<randomguy5203> Terraria. Meh.
<LordCelestia> i didnt mean for the streamer to look at it haha
<Thunder_Dash> Eh... I don't like Terraria
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sorry, I already spend rediculous amounts of time playing games/posting ponies. I don't need to WATCH someone waste time on minecraft
<Apokalipse> Terraria's fun
<randomguy5203> It's more action/rpg with some creative elements.
<LordCelestia> i just meant anyone here who read the story to look at it
<GrimGallop> I watched a series called Super Minecraft. It was full of lulz.
<LordCelestia> whos streaming??
<Turgle> THAT EYE
<Pinkie-Pie> Play Story of the Blanks
<Turgle> THAT NOSE
<Pinkie-Pie> Prince-Dari, SOTB. :P

<Thunder_Dash> What hero said
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh is this that stupid "creepy" applebloom game?
<Turgle> uuuuuh
<Pinkie-Pie> Valthejean, is there anything you dont hate?
<Turgle> friendship is 8-bit
<herospirit> Val, you hate everything.
<herospirit> :p
<ValtheJean> 2,14 plenty of things
<herospirit> Most things
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just my taste is far too refined for your dulled senses
<LordCelestia> PRESS SPACE
<Pinkie-Pie> Caramel and being a mod, right?
<Turgle> PRESS C
<Pinkie-Pie> Lol
<TheJanitor> Val is Prince Blueblood!
<LordCelestia> shit i gotta go and i wont be able to see this
<Silvermane> This is a great game
<LordCelestia> alright cya
<LordCelestia> http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d49u6y2
<WhatPayne> Already saw DCD play this if I remember correctly
<Sumica> Val hates everything without Caremel
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well Dari, since you never played it you can just go shut the fuck up
<CyberToyny> XDD
<Silvermane> honestly, it may be short, but it's so dark and chilling, and the sequels promised are going to be great
<Turgle> hoity toity xD
<Apokalipse> hoity toity taste haha
<randomguy5203> Oh god don't start ripping Baldur's Gate. The flames will never subside
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, I beat it
<TheJanitor> Planescape Torment?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because they are
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Dari: prove me wrong
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I dare you to
<Pinkie-Pie> All rights reserved.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and I'll concede your point
<Silvermane> Baldur's Gate is simply too accurate and true to the real V2 for me.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 until then, you can go drink biscuits
<Turgle> ^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, DRINK biscuits
<TheJanitor> I would like to point out that your opinion on how good a game is is just that, opinion.
<Thunder_Dash> Drink biscuits? 'Kay then
<herospirit> How does on drink biscuits
<herospirit> How
<ValtheJean> 2,14 exactly
<randomguy5203> I think the argument goes that it's very accurate to tabletop mechanics?
<Turgle> i'm ok with that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it is because you're a retarded brit with no taste
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that is why
<Turgle> rofl
<Pinkie-Pie> Isnt Baldurs Gate really short? I havent played it in a long time
<herospirit> Brits = taste
<ValtheJean> 2,14 baldur's gate is like...70 hours long...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 doesn't mean you're right :P
<Silvermane> a good RPG typically is very long
<Thunder_Dash> This is why I love the word "opinion"
<Apokalipse> >mfw nobody isa ctually right
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes it is :P
<Silvermane> ladies, ladies, please, no fighting
<ValtheJean> 2,14 tht's because my opinion actually matters dari :P
<CyberToyny> Plaaaayyyyy
<herospirit> ....I dunno, Baldur's Gate got pretty good ratings on GF.
<CyberToyny> ignore him XD
<Turgle> ladies, ladies, please, space
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nobody cares about some silly brit :P
<Silvermane> let's just agree that the worst game ever is between the ET game and that one Aquaman game
<Sumica> around and around is where i see you going with this.
<CyberToyny> and Superman 64
<Thunder_Dash> Silvermane; Action 52. That is all
<herospirit> Can we...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, you completely misunderstood that metaphor
<herospirit> Can we make a different metaphor?
<herospirit> One without turds?
<Pinkie-Pie> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_bKzxHRgRbOo/SfYx7kUQcZI/AAAAAAAABjE/Nk_WRXh5lHs/s320/turd+polish.jpg
<Apokalipse> can we stfu and play the game?

<TheJanitor> Thunder_Dash: I think I actually did once. . .I had /no/ idea how to play it.
<herospirit> It's all true
<Sumica> way to keep close
<herospirit> LOL.
<Pinkie-Pie> Have you ever played this Dari? Or are you just messing around
<herospirit> I am easily amused
<randomguy5203> can you go off on other paths?
<randomguy5203> or are those decoration?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ZOMBIE GOASTS, LEAVE THIS PLACE
<Thunder_Dash> BUT THIS IS OUR HOUSE :'(
<randomguy5203> Darn.
*GrimGallop vanishes for a while
<CyberToyny> WHY DOES ZECORA LIVE THERE IF ITS EVIL?!
<Sumica> Zecora just say gtfo, it's faster.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 zecora actually speaks in rhymed couplets tyvm :P
<TheJanitor> To be fair, this is about the kind of quality you could expect from NES games.

<NewDCD> 9naw, it's in VBA as well
<NewDCD> 9just make sure your scale matches your filter
<NewDCD> 9as in, if you're playing at 2X size, use HQ2X

<Silvermane> Twilight Sparkly-Night woke with a yawn as night was replaced by day in an instant. It was another beautiful day, with a gentle breeze blowing from the air conditioners. She could scarcely believe it had only been three months since she had moved to this peaceful side-gallery from the hustle and bustle of The Camelot Room where she had grown up. Ever since sh
<Silvermane> Ever since she was a little pencil sketch she had felt out of place, awkward in that massive space in which hung paintings of all shapes and sizes. She had been alone and lost in the crowd.

<EspyLacopa> Wait a tick. Jovian Lizards? Those are the 'villains' of Nadesico, aren't they?
<Natleyn> Spike, man up D:
<Sumica> Yes EspyLacopa
<Dermathil> Yes EspyLacopa.
<Solarboy> Ooooo, more SRT
<EspyLacopa> ....I'm sorry, I have to go laugh some more now.
<Sumica> SRW is a giant robot crossover of many shows.
<Dermathil> AWWW YEAH
<Dermathil> GET EM SPIKE
<Dermathil> SHOW EM THE POWER OF MANTICORE

<Dermathil> fire the gems
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<Solarboy> Rarity stooooooooooorm!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 this mecha uses the powers of his favorite unicorn
<Natleyn> ^ <3
<Sumica> no kill like overkill
<Dermathil> yes, 5k damage.
<EspyLacopa> DCD, you should have gone in and changed the weapon names too.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 obviously Rarity has to work overtime to supply him with this many gems :P
<NewDCD> 9I can change them in the intermission
<NewDCD> 9so we'll do that post-stage
<Dermathil> EspyLacopa: I'm sure he will at the intermission
<EspyLacopa> Ah, fair enough
<Dermathil> he confirmed it
<NewDCD> 9oh and I can change them for any unit
<Natleyn> WE NEED SNAILS IN A MECH, DCD.
<NewDCD> 9APPLEBOUNCE
<Dermathil> Looking forward to an awesome mech that NewDCD knows has a SHIT pilot.
<Natleyn> PFfffffft haha
<EspyLacopa> What would Snails' mech be? Ursa Minor?
<Natleyn> Yes.
<Dermathil> EspyLacopa: Snips
<NewDCD> 9obviously then Snails would be the Strike and the Freedom
<Sumica> boob bounces out of no where
<NewDCD> 9then again
<NewDCD> 9I DO like Snails
<NewDCD> 9but I don't like Jesus Yamato
<Natleyn> o3o
<Dermathil> Y U no finger crushers, NewDCD? That attack is so darn cool... Also, Ye need the Tempest Lancer
<Dermathil> TEMPEST LANCER!!!! GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Natleyn> And then Tempest Lancer
<EspyLacopa> Gem Lance!
<Dermathil> Fav attack for that mech
<NewDCD> 9oh God
<Natleyn> Shatter and die!
<Natleyn> o^oo
<NewDCD> 9Tempest Lancer: MANSPIKE ATTACK
<Dermathil> I wub the Tempest Lancer.
<Dermathil> indeed, NewDCD.
<Dermathil> LVLUP
<EspyLacopa> What was the show that the crew aboard the Nadesico loved watching?
<Natleyn> Tempest Lancer is when Spike goes GAR enough to materialize his dreams
<Dermathil> lawl Natleyn. TTGL is only in SRW-Z2
<Natleyn> Awww :(
<Dermathil> So GAR power wasn't introduced back then
<Natleyn> I was 90% GAR yesterday
<Natleyn> Gonna miss that.
<NewDCD> 9>GAR Power wasn't introduced back then
<Dermathil> :3
<EspyLacopa> lol
<Natleyn> xD
*Natleyn hugs DCD
<Dermathil> Who said I didn't say that on purpose...
<Dermathil> xD
<EspyLacopa> Bitch Slap attack?
<Natleyn> Haha.
<Dermathil> wat
<Dermathil> FINGER CRUSHER
<NewDCD> 9wanted to watch all attacks
<NewDCD> 9so we could rename them
<Sumica> fingered it to death.
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<Dermathil> MECHABEASTS ARE HERE
<Dermathil> KILL EM'
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<EspyLacopa> What series are the mechabeasts from?
<Dermathil> I dun' know
<NewDCD> 9Mazinger
<Dermathil> aaaaaaaaaah
<Dermathil> guts...
<Dermathil> yay
<Dermathil> best healing power in the early stages
<ValtheJean> 2,14 what does flying actually do for your mech?
<NewDCD> 9you ignore terrain
<EspyLacopa> I'm guessing better move speed.
<Dermathil> yeah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 aahhhhh
<NewDCD> 9which might be disadvantegous or advantegeous
<NewDCD> 9god I just killed phonics
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and I'm guessing that means you don't get the defense bonies as well?
<Dermathil> wat
<Dermathil> yes Val.
<NewDCD> 9it can be Disadvantageous or Advantageous
<Dermathil> you get neither bonuses or penalties
<NewDCD> 9Forests, for example, grant def bonuses and evasion penalties
<NewDCD> 9and also make you move slower
<Natleyn> I should watch more mecha anime. >_>;
<Dermathil> indeed
<Dermathil> some of them are flipping awesome.
<EspyLacopa> Real Robot anime or Super Robot anime?
<Dermathil> both have awesome shows
<Sumica> DCD should let me show Rebuild of eva.
<EspyLacopa> Breast Missiles!
<Solarboy> Breast! Missiles!
<Natleyn> I'll watch some Nadeisco later.
<Dermathil> in the Real Robot animes, I would recommend Dai-Guard.
<NewDCD> 9Sumica: >Implying I haven't planned streaming that.
<Sumica> =p
<Natleyn> DCD, this is why I love you
<Solarboy> I can't wait for the 3rd movie
<Solarboy> :v
<Dermathil> NewDCD knows how awesome Dai-Guard is, right?
<NewDCD> 9you all want to wreck this Mari
<NewDCD> 9http://blog-imgs-45-origin.fc2.com/m/e/l/meltyylove/Mari01.jpg
<NewDCD> 9and I don't blame you
<herospirit> So I imagine this game is pretty much the absolute dream of Mecha Anime fans
<Dermathil> 404 error NewDCD
<Sumica> Well ahve fun, gonna go play some Sins of a solar empire.
<Dermathil> the entire series is herospirit.
<Natleyn> Seeya later Sumica
<Natleyn> Hiya herospirit
*Natleyn hugs herospirit
<NewDCD> 9also Val
*herospirit hugs Nat
<NewDCD> 9flying consumes 5 En per turn
<NewDCD> 9all units regain 5 En every new Player Phase
<NewDCD> 9do the maht
<Dermathil> ooh, didn't know that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Solarboy> El calor*something*
<EspyLacopa> Makes sense.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no wonder lameass akito always ran out of EN!
<Natleyn> Hahaha
<Dermathil> hehehehe, makes sense yeah
<EspyLacopa> Breast Missiles!
<herospirit> Geez, if I play this game, I'm going to end up with a dozen animes I need to watch.
<Solarboy> El calor de neutra- acido es neutraliz- constante para-
<Natleyn> I remade the stupid transparency cursor with a rainbow instead of steadily decreasing transparencies
<Natleyn> hero: it's not a bad way to get into anime
<Solarboy> Chemistry homework DCD?
<Dermathil> NewDCD, that thing is about pH, that thing in spanish?
<Solarboy> It's in spanish indeed
<Natleyn> I got into 3-4 animes because of Jump Ultimate Stars.
<Dermathil> (I dun' understand spanish, but I know french and they share the same latin root)
<herospirit> Natleyn, same here.
<Silvermane> oh pH, that piece of shit of a design
<herospirit> ...I lost my copy of it a couple years back though
*Natleyn brohoofs herospirit
<herospirit> 60 bucks worth of import down the drain :p
*herospirit brohoofs Nat
<Natleyn> I still have Superstars lying around here, but my DS got lost during the first quarter of my freshman year. :C
<Natleyn> Egh.
<Natleyn> Junior.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 out of curiosity
<ValtheJean> 2,14 for mechs with multiple pilots
<ValtheJean> 2,14 do the pilot's stats stack?
<herospirit> Why are mech animes always so ridiculously badass
<Natleyn> because they're mech animes?
<Solarboy> Oh god Boss
<ValtheJean> 2,14 in other words, if I put one pilot with melee, and another with evade, would the bot get BOTH stat increases, or only from whoever is the main pilot?
<Natleyn> dat map
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes no maybe so?
<Sumica> iOh Hi Octavia
<Octavia> 13Hey
<ValtheJean> 2,14 howdy octy
*Natleyn hugs Octavia
<Natleyn> Hiya 'Tavi! <3
<VioletVanilla> 6Octy is back? :3 That was quick~
<Octavia> 13Bleh,k friend turned my computer off the wrong way and royally messed it up.
<Dermathil> Val, I have NO idea if they stack.
<Natleyn> Hello again Vanilla.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 do you know DCD?
<Dermathil> NewDCD, Val has a very interesting question about pilot stats.
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo Natleyn~ ;3
*Dermathil waves at Octavia and VioletVanilla
<EspyLacopa> I wonder why the Lizards are working with the Mechabeasts.
<Natleyn> ;3
<Dermathil> YAY INTERMISSION
<NewDCD> 9I think there's some stacking
*VioletVanilla waves back at Dermathil~
<NewDCD> 9but it's not exactly full-on stacking
<NewDCD> 9I don't really know the details
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hmmmm...okay. Thanks DCD :P
<Dermathil> thanks NewDCD
<Dermathil> who said they are, EspyLacopa?
<EspyLacopa> Were what?
<EspyLacopa> Oh, the lizards and the beasts.
<Dermathil> Lizards working with Mechabeasts
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> I dunno if they were or if they were just at the same place, same time
<EspyLacopa> I was just going with what the NPCs were saying.
<Octavia> 13Whew, so glad my computer is fine again. Thought the OS or HD was somehow screwed.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yikes
<ValtheJean> 2,14 glad to hear it's okay too :P
<Dermathil> how was it turned off Octavia?
<Octavia> 13I had it on lock and since I turn the monitor off while I have it locked, he simply pushed and held down the button.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 what does the mobility stat do? evade?
<NewDCD> 9pretty much
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9back
<NewDCD> 9thought up names?
<EspyLacopa> yay~
<Dermathil> eh, to force it shut doesn't usually damage it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 welcome back
<Bronydude> Hey everypony
<Octavia> 13Which in turn really messed it up. First time I've had that from turning it off.
<Natleyn> Still going with Snails.
<Octavia> 13Well, this time was different.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I vote something Rarity-like for the big laser
<EspyLacopa> Dragon Claw for the finger poke thing?
<Natleyn> Hiya Bronydude.
<Octavia> 13And tell that to my old Sony.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Like Rarity Beam or something...
<Bronydude> Hows everyone doing?
<Natleyn> Gem Storm?
<Dermathil> maybe it was because of the fact that it was under lock
<Natleyn> Eugh, that's terrible and generic
<Octavia> 13Maybe. But I've ever had that issue before.
<Octavia> 13*never
<Octavia> 13Not with this computer anyway.
<Dermathil> dragon Slash?
<Octavia> 13I seriously thought someone must have took something out of it or did something more to it.
<Natleyn> Aww yeah, Dragoon Claw
<EspyLacopa> Which one was O Slave?
<Natleyn> Gems.
<Sumica> Glad every thing is ok Octavia
<Natleyn> Apparently, anyway
<Dermathil> O Slave is the gem storm
<VioletVanilla> 6Glad to hear your computer is saved~
<EspyLacopa> gotcha.
<Octavia> 13Me too Sumica
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Rarity Storm, love it
<Dermathil> Octavia, you thought it had been tampered with?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I approve of your naming DCD :P
<Octavia> 13Yeah
<Natleyn> Oh man.
<Natleyn> What is this gonna be
<Dermathil> I'm sure that spear should make us think of the Heroic Spike dream sequence
<Octavia> 13It was giving me the signs the OS was gone or corrupted
<Natleyn> Yes.
<VioletVanilla> 6bootmgr.exe is missing
<Octavia> 13lol
<Bronydude> is the stream off or is my comp being a pain?
<VioletVanilla> 6OH FU--
<Dermathil> Bronydude, you on bronystate.net?
<Octavia> 13I thought maybe my roomie or one of his friends, since none of them like me too much right now, had intentionally done something to fuck it up.
<NewDCD> 9approved?
<EspyLacopa> Huzzah.
*Natleyn stamp of approval
<EspyLacopa> What do the P and C's mean after the attack names?
<Bronydude> yeah
<NewDCD> 9P is Physical I think
<Dermathil> P is melee and C is Combo
<NewDCD> 9as in, not a Beam attack
<NewDCD> 9C is for Combo
<VioletVanilla> 6. . . Remember what I said about this last night Octavia?
<NewDCD> 9no no
<NewDCD> 9Melee is the Fist icon in front of the attack name
<Bronydude> oh wait no im now
<Bronydude> excuse my fail
<NewDCD> 9I think B is Beam
<NewDCD> 9P is Physical
<Dermathil> wait, there are fist icons?
<Dermathil> Never noticed em before
<EspyLacopa> And the + sign in front instead of the fist icons?
<NewDCD> 9(would not damage Phase Shift armor, for example)
<NewDCD> 9it's a crosshair
<Bronydude> Back
<NewDCD> 9for ranged attacks
<EspyLacopa> Ohhhhhh
<NewDCD> 9so Nomenclature Approved?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 what exactly is combo for?
<Bronydude> was using an ancient link
<NewDCD> 9well there's a pilot skill named Combo
<Bronydude> im checking out cool rooms that might stream season 2
<NewDCD> 9it will have a level
<NewDCD> 9when you are in front of an enemy
<NewDCD> 9and that enemy has another enemy adjacent to them
<NewDCD> 9say, behind them
<NewDCD> 9you can attack them both
<EspyLacopa> Sounds like something to abuse maliciously.
<Dermathil> ooh, chain attacks
<NewDCD> 9if you have Combo Level 2 you can chain it to two other enemies as well
<NewDCD> 9not really
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah, I see
<NewDCD> 9since enemies have to be standing RIGHT BEHIND each other
<NewDCD> 9in a straight line
<NewDCD> 9and all Combo attacks are 1-Range
<EspyLacopa> Is that why the Combo version only has a range of one and slightly lower attack?
<NewDCD> 9okay, names approved?
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<EspyLacopa> Looks good.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 names look good to me
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dabunkydunk> eeyup
<EspyLacopa> I'm guessing you can only upgrade up to a max of where the blue starts for the mechs?
<Ziltoid> what game is this
<Ziltoid> ?
<EspyLacopa> Super Robot Wars.
<Dermathil> Ziltoid: SRW Z
<Dermathil> *J
<NewDCD> 9not really Espy
<NewDCD> 9when you fill everything that is not blue
<Ziltoid> Thisis snes game?
<NewDCD> 9you can access the Upgrade Bonus
<Dermathil> no, GBA
<NewDCD> 9which you will choose once and it will be permanent
<Ziltoid> ah
<Ziltoid> HHHHHNNNNNGGGG I WANT IT TO SATURADY ALREADY
<Natleyn> I can wait.
<Dermathil> hey NewDCD, who are those? I never understood what the heck they were doing
<Ziltoid> I can't
<NewDCD> 9Brain Powerds
<Natleyn> I wanna finish all weekend homework so I can spend all weekend in an squee fit
<Dermathil> do they appear later in the game?
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<Dermathil> how far later?
<NewDCD> 9Fluttershy would SO pilot a Brain Powerd
<Dermathil> I guess she would
<Ziltoid> anyone else lagging?
<Dermathil> seeing how they are well, brain-powered
<Natleyn> Zil: a little bit, here and there
<Ziltoid> OH SHIT ANOTHER SEASON " CLIP ON EQD
<Natleyn> Yep.
<Dermathil> want to have a look at it Ziltoid?
<Dermathil> It is glorious.
<Natleyn> CMC being adorable.
<Zephirdd> oh boy
<Zephirdd> Nadesico
<Dermathil> eeeyup Zephirdd
<Derpmind> uuuuh what
<Zephirdd> I remember watching that anime a loooooooooooong time ago
<Derpmind> is this
<Derpmind> I don't even
<Dermathil> SRW J, Derpmind
<Dermathil> A massive crossover of all the robot animes ever made.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and it is awesome
<ValtheJean> 2,14 pure awesome
<Dermathil> indeed.
<Dermathil> the Z2 one in the series is probably the most awesome of the bunch
<Dermathil> It has Dai-Guard AND TTGL
<ValtheJean> 2,14 All I want is Veritechs and I'm happy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but I still need to get that PSP game....if only I knew how
<Natleyn> What PSP game?
<Ziltoid> oh fuck i just watched it
<Dermathil> SRW Z2
<ValtheJean> 2,14 think it's called Taisen, right?
<Dermathil> Yeah, Valthejean.
<Ziltoid> SO MUCH WANT
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, I want it hardcore
<NewDCD> 9Super Robot Wars Z2
<Dermathil> But known as Super Robot Wars Z2
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<ValtheJean> 2,14 every time DCD streams it, I fangasm
*Dermathil brohoofs NewDCD
<Dermathil> oh god, not her.
<Dermathil> Not that captain.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol I like Ruri a lot (as a pilot at least)
<Dermathil> Not Ruri
<Dermathil> I mean the captain. The main one
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah I know, you were talking about the captain
<Dermathil> The girl
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I was just saying I like Ruri
<Dermathil> Ruri is way better character I agree though
<Dermathil> yeah, I don't like Yurika
<EspyLacopa> Fukube is awesome.
<Dermathil> I agree, Espy
<EspyLacopa> JUSTICE!
<Dermathil> SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE!!!
<Dermathil> GOGOGO!!!
<Dermathil> Hey NewDCD, what's the penalty for exiting that yellow grid? I never understood that
<Dermathil> Aww yeah, Combattler V
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Oh I can answer that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the yellow grid gives distortion field defenses to any Aestivalis inside it
<Dermathil> ooh
<NewDCD> 9not really
<Dermathil> so that's why
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if an Aestivalis is outside that grid, it is incredibly vulnerable
<NewDCD> 9the Yellow Field gives you UNLIMITED energy
<Natleyn> Aww yeah, Dragoon Claw
<EspyLacopa> I think that was something from the anime.
<Dermathil> OOOH
<Dermathil> Unlimited energy
<Dermathil> I like the sound of that.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 wait, but it also gives you defense doesn't it?
<NewDCD> 9and since Distortion Field uses Energy
<NewDCD> 9like all other force-field type mech abilities
<NewDCD> 9you see it a lot more when on the grid
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh, I thought they needed to be in the grid to use the distortion field
<Dermathil> also, NewDCD, what's the use of the various platforms for the Aestivalis? Are we supposed to outfit them depending on the situation?
<EspyLacopa> So, is the goal to destroy all enemies, or to move the Nergal to the other side of the map?
<Dermathil> kill all hostiles, EspyLacopa
<Dermathil> dick missile...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, they do different things
<Ziltoid> Scootaloo is a dodo
<Dermathil> SHHHHH ZIL
<ValtheJean> 2,14 like the artillery has longer range and stuff (assuming I understand right)
<Dermathil> what I mean is, are there scenarios that would recommend changing platforms?
<NewDCD> 9they all have different stats and different weapons
<Dermathil> Or is it always needed to have one of each?
<Dermathil> well by needed I mean recommended
<NewDCD> 9just think about the situation you're in
<NewDCD> 9and what would they be advantageous as
<NewDCD> 9(when you get the Lunar Frame you'll probably be using that 24/7 though)
<Natleyn> Hiya Nittany
<Dermathil> is the Artillery frame generally useful?
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<NewDCD> 9in the right situation
<ValtheJean> 2,14 personally I love the artillery frame
<NewDCD> 9specially when the user has Support Attack
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but that's because I'm the guy who likes smiting people from afar
<Dermathil> heheheh I liked to use my Banpresto mech (same as NewDCD) and tank attacks in the enemy phase, oneshotting them on the counterattack
<Dermathil> (he had 8k hp)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, I use mazinger and combattler for that
<Dermathil> (2nd best mech had around 6k)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meanwhile I pick them off from afar with mai snipah bot
<NewDCD> 9boy Val are you going to love the Bellzelute Brigandy
<Dermathil> I basically wiped an entire wave of enemies by finger crushing them all
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm guessing my Bellzelute gets upgraded at some point?
<Dermathil> yes, Val.
<Dermathil> I think
<NewDCD> 9it's SRW
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh god....my body is ready
<NewDCD> 9of course the Original gets an upgrade of some sort
<Dermathil> FINGER CRUSH-
<Dermathil> Oh wait
<Natleyn> DON'T YOU FREEZE NOW D:
<Dermathil> wrong attack name
<Natleyn> Darn it...
<NewDCD> 9It freezes when I type lulz
<Dermathil> Natleyn, he's just typing in chat when it freezes
<Natleyn> Oh.
<MrChang> so there's D&P bronystate sessions now
<Dermathil> when the game isn't clicked on, it freezes like that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DCD: there's a setting you can enable so that it keeps playing when it isn't the active window
<MrChang> whoever wants to join, #Bronystate_D&P
<NewDCD> 9kills the audio though
<AllisZerofuu> It freezes when I pee?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah
<Pinkie-Pie> Whats my motivation MrChang?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 still, better than nothing :P
<MrChang> you'll either have lots of fun
<MrChang> or have fun
<Pinkie-Pie> Eh, as nice as that sounds. I have a bit of a headache atm
<Pinkie-Pie> Maybe next time :P
<MrChang> aww
<MrChang> we have 6 adventurers so far
<Natleyn> o-o;
<ValtheJean> 2,14 man, I love Combattler V's ultimate attack
<Natleyn> I may join at some point, MrChang
<MrChang> some point?!
<NewDCD> 9that isn't its ultimate
<MrChang> you can join at anytime
<NewDCD> 9it gets more later
<MrChang> ANYTIME
<NewDCD> 9and team-up attacks with Voltes
<ValtheJean> 2,14 It gets something BETTER than the Super EM lazer???? holy fuck
<Natleyn> I'm really tired today u.u
<MrChang> we're beginning trm
<MrChang> some of our core members are absent
<Natleyn> Oh.

<Dermathil> AWW YEAH
<randomguy2053> oh god those poor mooks
<Dermathil> REINFORCEMENTS
<NewDCD> 9Grunt
<NewDCD> 9Grunt like you've never grunted before
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would like Izumi...but I hate that he has to work together with those other idiots :P
<Dermathil> Wat why Grunt?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 laaaaaaaaaaaame
<NewDCD> 9Val
<NewDCD> 9just so you know
<NewDCD> 9Hikaru is basically madmax: the Real Robot Pilot
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<NewDCD> 9I'm not kidding, post-series she becomes a mangaka
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not even sure what that means :P
<NewDCD> 9and she's delightfully nerdy
<NewDCD> 9that means CHICK IS A COMIC ARTIST
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I still like Izumi :P
<Dermathil> madmax should've lit the lightbulb about comic artist
<EspyLacopa> Grunt like Tim Taylor on Tool Time?
<Dermathil> Eh, Akito. What a poor fool he is... Getting in situations like he will...
<Dermathil> TEAM-UP ATTACK
<Dermathil> AWW YEAH
<Dermathil> I LOVE THOSE
<Sumica> needs more gunbuster
<NewDCD> 9Alpha series has Gunbuster
<Sumica> did any of them ever get diebuster?
<NewDCD> 9not yet no
<NewDCD> 9RARITY STORM
<NewDCD> 9cue tits
<Natleyn> TITS
<EspyLacopa> lol
<herospirit> I fucking love that you can name all these things
<Natleyn> No Gunbuster? ;~;
<herospirit> I need to download this. Also need to download a GBA emulator.
<Sumica> got to love diebuster it uses planets as weapons.
<Natleyn> Damn, now I want to watch Diebuster again
<Natleyn> I'll find a torrent or something later >_>
*Sumica has it.
<Natleyn> Ahh. O:
<Sumica> not sure if i have the tracker for it any more.
<EspyLacopa> Is Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier any good?
<NewDCD> 9supposedly
<NewDCD> 9but it's a spin-off
<KanyeEast> so there I was, checking out a boxset of dr.who at my uni's library. I casually remark where dr.who was made "england" and the nice girl behind the counter asked me how i understood them. Apparently people in england do not speak english
<NewDCD> 9I'd recommend you to play the GBA OG games instead
<KanyeEast> mfw
<Sumica> Did you tell her you understand them because of magnets?
<KanyeEast> sadly I did not, she was to cute to make fun of to her face
<NewDCD> 9People in England
<NewDCD> 9speaking english?
<Natleyn> D:
<NewDCD> 9surely, you jest?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a lie
<NewDCD> 9*!
<Natleyn> I'd mention something about channeling Steven_Magnet
<ValtheJean> 2,14 obviously Dari has been speaking in Mongolian
<KanyeEast> no, i repeatedly said "england" and "Britain" and she asked me if they speak english in a completely serious manner
<Sumica> no no it's welish
<Dermathil> The girl prolly spoke of the accent
<KanyeEast> its not that different, you just add 'wanker' to the end of a sentence every once and awhile
<EspyLacopa> Main reason I asked about Endless Frontier, is due to it being the only DS one that's been released in the US.
<Natleyn> Haha
<NewDCD> 9Mugen no Frontier is actually a jRPG
<NewDCD> 9unlike the SRPG SRW games
<Natleyn> Breast Fire...
<Dermathil> Breast Fire is epic
<Natleyn> Byoyoingg.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 anyone else getting stream lag?
<NewDCD> 9it wasn't lag
<NewDCD> 9I got a pop-up notice on my end
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah, okay
<EspyLacopa> Whirlwind?
<Sumica> no wiiiiirlwhiiiiiind
<EspyLacopa> spiiiiiiiin
<NewDCD> 9brb
<Sumica> SCIENCE!
<EspyLacopa> Goggles!
<Natleyn> Spiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin
<EspyLacopa> Those silly Jovian Lizards.
<EspyLacopa> Quick, someone send some super robot anime discs!
<NewDCD> 9and that's it for tonight
<NewDCD> 9gotta catch up on schoolwork
<ValtheJean> 2,14 awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<NewDCD> 9not to mention work on preparations for Saturday
<ctrlx> >:D fuckya bourbon night
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well thanks for streaming dcd
<Natleyn> Awwwww.
<Natleyn> Thanks DCD!
<Barry> Hi.
<ctrlx> NewDCD, have fun
<Dermathil> Cya NewDCD!!!!!
<Barry> I just watched Broly the Legendary Super Saiyan on Nicktoons
<Barry> Question, is talking about S2 episode 1 after it airs viable for a ban?
*Dermathil thinks that Dai-Guard is still one of the best mechs in the SRW Z2 roster
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would say don't talk about it until all rerun streams have finished
<Barry> In otherwords, after the 26 episode ofS2?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but, I mean, this isn't really a set in stone kind of thing
<NewDCD> 9Barry: good question. We probably should make a spoiler room
<KanyeEast> you can obviously talk about the episode while we're watching it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would say just be reasonable about it
<Dermathil> I guess he means when we're about to stream episode 2
<Barry> No, I mean say between Monday and Saturday after episode 1.
<Dermathil> Valthejean: ever seen anything Dai-Guard?
<Barry> the samewith episodes 2-26
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'll talk it over with the other mods, and we'll let you know barry
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Derma: yes, I was there when DCD streamed it :P
<Barry> K
<Barry> I just wanted that cleared up
<Dermathil> oh right.
<Dermathil> Darn that show was awesome.
<Dermathil> BABABABABABABABABABBABABABABABA
<Sumica> wait till like Sunday seeing as by that point we wont show it till it comes up in loto again =p
<LordCelestia> hey guys
<Barry> aeiou
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvLBnMvApBg
<Dermathil> and now you has the babababababa stuck in your skull again.
<LordCelestia> is anyone here doin that ponies and dragons thing?
<Dermathil> LordCelestia: Someone is
<Dermathil> MrChang
<LordCelestia> dang he needs to invite me
<Natleyn> LordCelestia: #Bronystate_D&P
<LordCelestia> thx
<Natleyn> Lord, just use /join #bronystate_D&P >_>
<Barry> *spaceship is destroyed.* Gah, my spaceship! *armor is cracked* Gah, my space armor. "We get it, you're from space!"
<Sumica> I weld the mighty Cluebringer.
<Natleyn> Invites aren't really necessary...
<WhatPayne> Good night yall
<Pinkie-Pie> Good night WhayPayne
<Barry> Good night,Whatpayne
<Natleyn> Night WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> Why thank you Barry
<WhatPayne> And Natleyn
<Nittany_Tiger> Silence?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 indeed
<Barry> What's going on?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 silence, that's what :p
<Barry> why, though?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I dunno :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Because it's quiet time.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's Fluttershy's game.
<Barry> but that's for kids!
*Natleyn squees
<Barry> Yeah, well, Fluttershy's version of the game is more "who can hold their breath the longest", than "who can stay quiet the longest".
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, it was quiet game :P
<Barry> But why did she hold her breath?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh, to get them excited :P
<Nittany_Tiger> It's her winning method.
<Barry> I guess if you're holding your breath, you can't make a vocal noise.
<Barry> unless you sneeze, that is.
<TwilightSparkle> Wait register nicknames?
<Barry> And something else that gets me. She said she was the world champ of the quiet game. Is there like a championship in Equestria for that game?
<Barry> if so, must be a dull game.
<Barry> I mean, even chess sounds interesting next to the Quiet Game.
<TwilightSparkle> Hi octavia!
<Natleyn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1adNgZl_3Q
<Natleyn> Everyone needs to play this game.
<Natleyn> Now.
<MrChang> we have a bronystate D&P room, whomever is interested in playing, come join us at #Bronystate_D&P
<Barry> I can't believe it's nearly over. 14 years it's been since Philosopher's Stone, 10 since the movie. Now, we're waiting on just one more video game, and the Harry Potter series will be over.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 thank god
<Barry> 7 books, 8 movies, a myriad of video games, and one humongous fanbase.
<Pinkie-Pie> http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=826
<Dashite> Do we have lego potter for all 7 books yet?
<Pinkie-Pie> Im likin that one
<Barry> That's coming out thisNovember
<Barry> 5-7
<Barry> They may do a version with all eight movies in one piece, but that's definitely a 2012 release
<Barry> if it ever will be released.
<Barry> Wait, this video clip I'm watching is 10 minutes of that annoyingly cute squee sound?
<Natleyn> Yes.
<Natleyn> <3
<Natleyn> It is the squee game.
<Natleyn> You WILL lose to Fluttersquee.
<Dashite> If I turned it off <5 seconds in do I win or lose?
<Natleyn> Forfeit.
<Natleyn> :<
<Barry> You didn't join because the game hadn't started yet.
<Barry> Listening to it makes it sound like it's some kind of cat sound on replay
<Barry> Ok, imagine listening to that for one hour or more
<Dashite> Can I just listen to Nyancat instead?
<Barry> for one hour?
<Dashite> Sure
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6z3WXuzXXc
<Barry> Pinkie Pie's version
<Pinkie-Pie> I swear Barry im gonna turn the volume up and loop that overnight.

<Dashite> Winter > Spring/Summer/Autumn
<ctrlx> ^
<Ghosties> 4What Dashite said
<ctrlx> although last year i wrecked my car twice in the snow
<Natleyn> Winter > Autumn > Summer/Spring
<Ghosties> 4That sucks
<TrollightSparkle> Completely agree.
<Sumica> Not that game tonight Natleyn
<TrollightSparkle> Natleyn.
<Dashite> I don't mean the real season. :/
<Sumica> no sound makes every one sad.
<Natleyn> Ahh.
<Natleyn> 'kay.
<ctrlx> Sumica, what's the url for the stream? i wanna try vlc
<Dashite> Although it is pretty awesome as well.
<Natleyn> I'mma finish up this cursor and sleep >_>
<Sumica> might push it a bit with some full screen game off the pc though
<ctrlx> Ghosties, it wasn't so bad since the deductable was half of the repairs
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oooooh what game? :P
<Sumica> Not my place to give out stream info, you have to talk to colored text for that.
<Sumica> Lets try red faction:A
<Sumica> might lag to all get out though.
<Dashite> Only one way to find out.
<ctrlx> i'll check the site's code for it P:
<Ghosties> 4Oh, that's nice. Guess it wasn't so bad
<ctrlx> Ghosties, it's an 07 mustang so like...yah lol
<Ghosties> 4Haha, awesome
<ctrlx> still under 40k miles
<ctrlx> and i get my license back the 28th :D
<Ghosties> 4That's not bad at all, and I'm glad things are working out for ya
<ctrlx> damn thing costs me 350 a month for car payment and 200 for insurrance
<ctrlx> but i haven't missed a payment so it's helping my credit score i guess
<ctrlx> got it when i was 19
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, that's gonna be good for the future. Your credit score is gonna help you get whatever else is necessary. By the way, how old are you now?
<ctrlx> 21
<Ghosties> 4Cool
<ctrlx> i'm doing ok for a college dropout
<Sumica> ok stream will be up in just a sec....I think.

<ctrlx> <33
<Dashite> Natleyn is before NewDCD alphabetically, it should have come first!
<ctrlx> i always do the first 3 characters
<Dashite> No more watered down bourbon!
<ctrlx> FINE
<ctrlx> although my typing is starting to go downhill. i can still proof it first :x
<ctrlx> but obviously not drunk enough
<ctrlx> the environment in this game is cool
<ctrlx> how the buildings fall apart
<ctrlx> hm. steamcracked version...
<TrollightSparkle> So.. who else is thinking of getting Serious Sam 3?
<ctrlx> i haven't seen that yet
<ctrlx> but i'll probably get it anyways
<TrollightSparkle> It looks pretty awesome, a throwback to the shooters of old ages.
<ctrlx> i need to get another 2tb drive. i'm running out of storage
<TrollightSparkle> At least you have 2tb.. I'm running on 500GB here >.>
<Dashite> Only things I know I'm getting between now and the end of the yea are BF3 and Uncharted 3. Everything else is on a case by case basis.
<TrollightSparkle> Dashite YES
<ctrlx> i have 2tb, 2x80gb, 2x750gb, and a 60gb ssd
<ctrlx> :s
<TrollightSparkle> ._.
<Dashite> I have 1x60GB SSD, 1x320GB and 1x 1TB
<ctrlx> i've spent so much money on my comp
<Dashite> OS, Games, Data.
<Dashite> In that order.
<ctrlx> Dashite, pretty much the same thing i have
<ctrlx> my 2x80gb i use for random shit and virtual machines
<ctrlx> did he just fuck all three of those guys?
<ctrlx> at once?
<TrollightSparkle> I was thinking of getting an SSD when I get the money, should I?
<Dashite> Yup
<TrollightSparkle> And probably.
<ctrlx> TrollightSparkle, yes
<ctrlx> but
<ctrlx> you need to be sure that you change some windows settings
<ctrlx> like no prefetch. no hibernate. no defrag. and no pagefile on that drive
<ctrlx> the fewer writes you have on it the better
<FreezeFrame> sleep
<Dashite> Magnet gun never gets old.
<TrollightSparkle> What exactly is an SSD for? Just bootable OS's?
<Dashite> It's for speed.
<ctrlx> TrollightSparkle, it's best for hte OS
<ctrlx> well
<ctrlx> best for anything lol
<Dashite> Most people just use it for OS because they are still pretty expensive so getting one for storage costs a lot of money.
<ctrlx> i was thinking about getting another ssd for raid
<ctrlx> i'm a raid freak
<Dashite> :p
<ctrlx> then i'll buy a 750 off my friend so i'd have 2x60gb ssd, 2tb, and 3x750
<ctrlx> but really i'm just waiting for bulldozer to come out
<Dashite> Wonder what kind of speed I'd get if I just short stroked a 2TB drive down to oh say 60GB...
<Silvermane> “I don’t deserve them,” came the muffled reply. “I’m a horrible pony and I ruined the muffins and I ate the whole fridge and the world is ending and everything tastes of lemons and sadness.”
<ctrlx> Dashite, like, omfg?
<Dashite> lol
<ctrlx> but then you only have 60gb lol
<ctrlx> and it still wouldn't match an ssd
<ctrlx> :s
<ctrlx> i short stroked both my arrays by 40%
<ctrlx> why does Sumica have to do that thing to the walkways?
<Dashite> What thing?
<ctrlx> that thing
<ctrlx> he takes the gun out to make them appear
<Dashite> The blue glowy thing that rebuilds them after he blows them up?
<ctrlx> hm
<ctrlx> i'm liking these environments
<ctrlx> does it use physx?
<ctrlx> omg time to pee
<Dashite> Not sure what arma uses. I think the last one used Havok.
<Sumica> so you all had enough?
<Sumica> and the thing on the walkways it to repair them.
<Silvermane> “Hurry up! Somewhere in the space-time continuum there are baby muffins, lost and alone, just waiting for us to birth them!” Derpy disappeared. Carrot smiled and shook her head, then left to join Derpy in the cool morning air.
<ctrlx> i'll watch more
<ctrlx> i still got 64% of my bandwidth left
<ctrlx> or i'll skype lol.
<ctrlx> wait i don't have a mic. nevermind :x
<ctrlx> Sumica, what're your system specs?
<TrollightSparkle> I would use skype, but I can't.. since Linux is a b**** to work with.
<Sumica> quard core
<ctrlx> TrollightSparkle, oh it's not that baaad
<TrollightSparkle> When you're a fledgling computer nerd.. yeah..
<Silvermane> Carrot groaned. “Derpy, I’m serious,” she said. “It really wouldn’t kill you to try something different for a change. The world doesn’t revolve around muffins, you know!” Derpy laughed. “Carrot, I swear, you say the strangest things sometimes!” She trotted away happily.
<ctrlx> Sumica, amd or intel? and gpu?
<ctrlx> TrollightSparkle, i'll help ya :3
<TrollightSparkle> Thank you much :)
<ctrlx> what distro do you got
<TrollightSparkle> I just use Empathy IM for the moment.
<TrollightSparkle> And Ubuntu 10.10.
<TrollightSparkle> I've been told to downgrade to 9.04, I'm thinking about it.
<ctrlx> eehhhhh i don't like ubuntu but i can work with it.
<ctrlx> i like redhat based distros better
<ctrlx> like fedora
<ctrlx> but htat's really just a personal preference
<ctrlx> wait when did he get that suti?
<TrollightSparkle> I've only recently got into Linux, actually.
<TrollightSparkle> And that is a pretty badass suit, if I don't say.
<ctrlx> TrollightSparkle, it's not too hard really. it's just different.
<TrollightSparkle> Yeah I know.
<ctrlx> i would still say the best thing to know is comand line interface for anything
<ctrlx> if you are comfortable in one then you'll learn how to run other stuff
<TrollightSparkle> Been trying to learn some of terminal, it's a bit confusing.
<ctrlx> you'll get the hang of it
<ctrlx> learn how to navigate then you can learn how to use specific programs
<ctrlx> if you want to be hardcore, learn gentoo. that'll teach you a lot
<TrollightSparkle> I'm feeling in a bit of a hardcore mode, so what is Gentoo?
<ctrlx> it's a distro that you build yourself from source code
<TrollightSparkle> Hmm.
<TrollightSparkle> That sounds interesting, but something I'd like to try.
<ctrlx> basically all you have to do is partition, lay down the base system, configure, then compile in stuff you want
<FlutterBro> Hi guys.
<DecapKnight> you're kind of late for that post Dari
<DecapKnight> hey FlutterBro
<FlutterBro> I've been reading sooooooooooooooooooooooo much fanfic.
<prince-dari> Well I can make that post while I'm not online can I?
<prince-dari> can't*
<DecapKnight> I've been reading soooooooooooooooo much of this collage history textbook
<FlutterBro> You could make a bot for it, right?
<DecapKnight> he does have a bot for it i think
<Rainbow-Dash> Prince-Dari, what would happen if you left for a week? Would we be spammed with EQD posts?
<Dermathil> hey prince-dari
<Dermathil> I think that yes, Rainbow-Dash
<FlutterBro> oh, just make it one of the mane 6 like you were plainng.
<prince-dari> Rainbow-Dash: Nope, it only posts the latest one
<Dermathil> it is a bot that posts those EqD updates
<Rainbow-Dash> Ah, I see
<prince-dari> [15:59] <FlutterBro> You could make a bot for it, right? The bot would still connect from my computer
<Rainbow-Dash> Are you gonna try again to be the guy?
<Rainbow-Dash> XD
<prince-dari> So when automatic updates strike (like during this night, EVIL DOER!), it'd still DC.
<FlutterBro> I'd have to learn how to make a chat bot first ><
<DecapKnight> Dari is going to try to be the guy again?
<FlutterBro> then'd I'd have to find out how your bot gets the feed.
<Awesomeshy> ohai ponynaut
<Awesomeshy> no
<Awesomeshy> prince-dari:
<prince-dari> Dat tabfail.
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Awesomeshy> :c y u so p ponychat
<prince-dari> Is there any way to stop mode messages showing up?
<prince-dari> So when I voice someone, nothing shows up? :o
<AllisZero> gpedit dari
<Awesomeshy> Mailbox Login: pontang@ponychat.net (use the whole thing!)
<Awesomeshy> wow
<prince-dari> Because other than a server module, a voice/devoice bot would be the easiest way I could throttle messages to a channel.
<Pontang> wat
<Awesomeshy> wow
<AllisZero> Change the settings so it only does updates when you tell it to
<prince-dari> And all the +v/-v spam would kind of ruin that.
<FlutterBro> Or you could find somewhere to host the chat bot and control it remotely
<prince-dari> My voice is even worse than yesterday. XD
<Kabaka> prince-dari: /cs set #channel verbose off
<prince-dari> Thank you. :>
<DecapKnight> Flutterbro, where is Fluttershy?
<Kabaka> Mmhmm :-)
<FlutterBro> DecapKnight: At college right now. I'm at HS right now waiting for my next class
<FlutterBro> which is a college class in 20 mins
<DecapKnight> what do you mean wait for your next class?
<FlutterBro> I'm doing concurrent enrollment.
<DecapKnight> you lost me at concurrent
<FlutterBro> I'm taking college classes in High School
<DecapKnight> oh
<DecapKnight> So am I
<FlutterBro> remotely through a big TV
<DecapKnight> I'm taking classes that are a collage level
<DecapKnight> but I'm in an actual class room
<FlutterBro> I'm taking real college classes.
<FlutterBro> and I forgot to bring my homework ><
<DecapKnight> I would but I'm only a sophomore
<FlutterBro> It's still in the printer at home
<DecapKnight> thats one reason why I like to use google docs
<FlutterBro> I can print it here, but it would cost some money.
<DecapKnight> are you at a collage?
<FlutterBro> I'm at my high school
<DecapKnight> your high school charges for printing?
<FlutterBro> I'm not sure actually
<mib_hcark3> The "Time Until Next Stream" says "Show Time!" but the video says "this broadcast is offline. Please check back later." is this normal?
<DecapKnight> seems like it
<DecapKnight> Flutterbro where the hell is this high school?
<FlutterBro> DecapKnight: Utah
<DecapKnight> well, all i know about there is that there is snow and desert
<mib_hcark3> Flutterbro, you have my condolences
<DecapKnight> and apparently a lot of Mormons
<FlutterBro> Northern Utah is pretty nice
<DecapKnight> well Northern Wisconsin is nice in the summer at least
<mib_hcark3> what IRC server is this?
<DecapKnight> in the winter it sucks
<FlutterBro> oh, fun fact: over 60% of our land is locked up by the government!
<DecapKnight> Fun Fact: Wisconsin has the same type of weather as Alaska in winter, which is usually around 0 to -15 degrees daily
<FlutterBro> Oh, and the best way to desricbe N. Utah weather is bi-polar
<FlutterBro> really cold in the winter and really hot in the summer
<DecapKnight> the best way to describe the weather here is full blown schizophrenic
<DecapKnight> seriously
<FlutterBro> O.o
<DecapKnight> today its around freezing
<DecapKnight> tommorow its supposed to be around 70
<FlutterBro> thats crazy
<DecapKnight> yeah
<FlutterBro> I won't usually be able to chat during school though
<FlutterBro> this room is usually blocked
<FlutterBro> almost time to start class.
<Rainbow-Dash> Whats with all the Skittles ads?

<Barry> I was playing Mother 3 just now.
<Straightjacket> it has goats
<Kabaka> Mostly ponies.
<Awesomeshy> maybe a manticore here and there
<Straightjacket> it has goats now
<VioletVanilla> 6It seems. . .. silent . . .
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lies
<AllisZero> Hai
<Dashite> Truth
<MrChang> hey everypony
<MrChang> anybody here?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nope

<ValtheJean> 2,14 HEATHEN
<DecapKnight> thank you
<Pontang> rofl
<Dashite> :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Les Miz is short for Les Miserables
<DecapKnight> and what is that?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 .....................
<PrincessKah> shap nem?
*ValtheJean prepares his trident
<DecapKnight> didn't we rule against Val using his trident?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 "we". I don't recall you ever being in that kind of position :P
<VioletVanilla> 4Les Miz is a lie.
<VioletVanilla> 6It is Les Miserables~ ;3
<DecapKnight> that doesnt help me
<Pontang> Cosette has never been more moe: http://animegravity.com/images/characters/main_images/cosette_18461.jpg
<Pontang> e_e
<PrincessKah> What have I found here?
<PrincessKah> lol
<VioletVanilla> 6A most delicious and wonderful musical/thatre story is what it is!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's also a book
<Pontang> lol
<DecapKnight> oh
<DecapKnight> so thats why i dont know what it is
<Dashite> Pontang, no, that is a horrible link!
<PrincessKah> I can't see the broadcast :(
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's probably because no one is streaming :P
<Pontang> Lez miz is usually the name given to the play. While Les Miserables is often considered the book. :I
<PrincessKah> Maybe :p
<PrincessKah> lol
<DecapKnight> The reason i dont know what it is is because I dont listen to musicals, or go to the theater
<ValtheJean> 2,14 stop me violet....I'm reaching for my trident
<Pontang> Read the book.
<Pontang> It came first.
<Pontang> ;x
<DecapKnight> I might try reading it
<PrincessKah> I don't either, the text looks werid, i can't work out if i am misspelling things
<Pontang> Or if you like anime, there is an anime of it.
<Pontang> Shoujo Cosette
<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRNYp1IiUuE&ob=av3e
<DecapKnight> This is the music I listen to
<DecapKnight> so it makes sense that I dont listen to musicals
<Dashite> Totally picking a musical for next movie night...
<PrincessKah> I was gonna listen to Slipknot on the bus home today, but i decided that rammstine would be better
<DecapKnight> I'm going to pick Dr. Strangelove
*VioletVanilla giggles and grabs the trident from Val's throne.
<DecapKnight> Val gets a freaking throne?
<Dashite> VAL HAS A THRONE?!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 WHO LET YOU IN MY THRONEROOM?

<PrincessKah> Did slipknot ever do a song with mariyln manson? (how ever you spell his name)
<DecapKnight> Idk
<ValtheJean> 2,14 doesn't matter what type dari, so long as it's tight on my ass ;)
<DecapKnight> I dont like Mariyln Manson
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> Val loves him some skinny jeans.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you know it baby
*ValtheJean winks
<DecapKnight> Guys wearing skinny jeans?
<DecapKnight> Sounds like my friends...
<prince-dari> Yeah, I used to have some.
<DecapKnight> I own none

<DecapKnight> /suuuuuuuure/
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol now for the rest of time Dari will stream GAP commercials
<prince-dari> Well baggy's good if you're overweight, I suppose.
<prince-dari> :P
<Pontang> prince-dari: agreed. Don
<DecapKnight> It's all muscle
<Pontang> Don't want to see fat girls in tight jeans.
<Pontang> e_e
*VioletVanilla giggles at Dari and Val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 GIMME BACK MAI TRIDENT
<VioletVanilla> 6Why are you taking all of my jeans?! D:
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because they feel so nice :<

<Sumica> Well I ment more alongthe lines of trying to learn somthing while your a few quarts low on blood might not go well.
<Shidoshi> I wanna see how well this channel will hold up Saturday
<MrChang> it will succumb to nothing-ness
<DecapKnight> i've done that before
<DecapKnight> it wasnt easy though
<Shidoshi> I don't it's far from reasonable to say we'll have 2000 people
<Shidoshi> I don't think*
<DecapKnight> hey Luna
<Sumica> Oh Hi Luna
<Zacoda> Hi Luna
<FreezeFrame> Yo, Luna
<Dermathil> Shidoshi: unless they will have fixed the chat problem by then, I think the chat will be capped at 200 peopls.
*GrimGallop returns
<Sumica> I think they fixed taht back when we did the stress test back last week.
*GrimGallop gives Luna a potato
*FreezeFrame pokes Luna about the op interview
<Shidoshi> I remember there were more than 200 people when you had that test
<Sumica> yeah
*DecapKnight hugs Luna
*Luna hugs everypony
<VioletVanilla> 6Oh look what you have done now. I am a potatoe.
<Sumica> 240 somthing iirc.
*VioletVanilla hugs Luna back gently~
*GrimGallop is hugged
<Shidoshi> but it's nowhere near a close representation of the real stress of 1000+ people
<Sumica> True, but cant force people to log in for stress test =p
*Sumica tackle hugs Luna and VioletVanilla
*DecapKnight hugs VioletVanilla
*VioletVanilla falls over as she is tackle hug'd and hugged~

<Shidoshi> somewhat
*Luna is just a little busy atm
<Shidoshi> I'm not really used to this chat
<DecapKnight> im multitasking
<Shidoshi> and having nothing to watch while talking takes away some of the fun
<Shidoshi> I liked the synchtubes
*Luna doesn't like synchtubes
*EspyLacopa is off watching the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
<MrChang> espy
<MrChang> how are the char sheets going?

*Luna is not a techy
<VioletVanilla> 6Apokalipse~ c:
<Apokalipse> I'd love to, but I have absolutely no idea whatsoever
<AllisZero> I'm just venting :(
<AllisZero> I've spent many hours on this already.
<Turgle> maaaaan
<Apokalipse> I know how it feels to spend hours on something techy like that
<Turgle> i took two hours off from work just to see mlp
<EspyLacopa> I just tossed my heartstone in Dalaran. With its handy portal over to Stormwind, the only major place I can't get to quickly is Shattrath.
<AllisZero> It's cool Turgle, I took amost two weeks
<Turgle> :D
<Apokalipse> haha
<Apokalipse> If ponies aren't a good enough reason to take time off work then nothing is
<Sumica> where is my electrical tape?

<EspyLacopa> World of Warcraft needs more pony.
<AllisZero> That it does
<Sumica> I must find it because I need it FOR SCIENCE!
<AllisZero> Blizz should make a reference
<Luna> 07World of Warcraft needs more lore / epic quests
<Luna> 07less grinding
<AllisZero> In fact, it they should have Achievements referencing MLP coming in next patch or after
<EspyLacopa> An achievement titled "The Magic of Friendship"?
<Sumica> Friendship is magic: Convence Deathwing to give it all up and go sleep somewhere else.
<Apokalipse> World of Warcraft? Please, I've had enough of my friends talking about it all day every day in school
<VioletVanilla> 6Less grind pl0x o:
<EspyLacopa> And as grindy as WoW is now. . .it used to be soo much worse.
<EspyLacopa> Oh so much worse.
<AllisZero> I'm SURE at least 20% Cooler will show up at some point
<AllisZero> Oh Wow isn't grindy at all if you compare it to other MMOs
<AllisZero> Shit, you have an entire heirloom gearset now to help you level
<prince-dari> MFW all MMOs are 'grindy'.
<WhatPayne> Hey Luna when is that "soon" you will be streaming?
<Sumica> It's all a grind, wow just is the gear grind at the end.
<Pontang> prince-dari: sorry about this, services are a bit twitchy with the move.
<AllisZerofff> Woops
<VioletVanilla> 6>mfw I do not play MMOs because of thus fact
<prince-dari> Pontang: I hadn't identified.

<LordCelestia> i like ponies but not enough to spend that much time on them! lol
<LordCelestia> actually i cou;ld
<Zephirdd> says the pony supposed to be the ruler
<LordCelestia> i guess my time on the internet is enough to takee up 100 pgs lol
<LordCelestia> oh
<LordCelestia> *cough*
<LordCelestia> i mean,
<LordCelestia> I have time for everypony
<Zephirdd> lol :P
<LordCelestia> Magic is friendship!
<LordCelestia> is anypony here a fan-fic writer?
<Zephirdd> So I had two ideas for fics the other day, one where I'd introduce RD's family that she ran away from when she was a filly(and kicked out of flight school) and other that would explain the creation of Equestria, as a new world born from the rotten human world by the sacrifice of the last human life
<Zephirdd> which one should I write?
<prince_dari> MFW I've had mIRC open for 8550 hours.
<Zephirdd> >yfw you've had mIRC open for less than 9000 hours
<prince_dari> SOON.JPG
<LordCelestia> idk, the world one sounds better
<Zephirdd> ^_^
<prince_dari> That's 356.25 days it's been open for.
<prince_dari> It's been open for almost a year. XD
<Zephirdd> its been
<Zephirdd> a while
<LordCelestia> Im currently working on a fan-fic series. it's about a human who is goiong to master the ability to travel between the two worlds via a magic mirror but this one is gonna focus on the human teaching ponies new things
<prince_dari> So over about 5 years of time, it has been open for a year of it, nearly. XD
<LordCelestia> like things that humans can do better
<Zephirdd> oh, I remember you talking about it
<LordCelestia> yeah, i released an ideas list (it isnt too long but still)
<Zephirdd> meh
<Zephirdd> off to play some dota
<Zephirdd> brb
<LordCelestia> if u even care
<LordCelestia> http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d49u6y2
<LordCelestia> ok
<prince_dari> "A store over in Sweden called "Lidl" apparently carries the 4 pack blindbag set. If you live over there, you might as well pick one up!
<prince_dari> "
<prince_dari> MFW Lidle in Sweden has blind bags.
<prince_dari> WE HAVE LIDL HERE

<Zephirdd> Or a fic about the creation of Equestria out of the rotten human world, from the sacrifice of the last human life?
<EspyLacopa> Steampunk Twilight shirt?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Option C: I don't fucking read fanfics
<Zephirdd> oh
<Zephirdd> *facehoof*
<FreezeFrame> That looks like Rainbow Dash always dresses in style ;P
<Zephirdd> or RD mother and her sisters >_>'
<LordCelestia> i read fanfics sometimes. the world one seems more interesting but ive always enjoyed thinking Equestria was a different world, existing alongside our own across the universe,
<LordCelestia> and stuff
<LordCelestia> thats what i would say if i was a human
<LordCelestia> but, yea
<EspyLacopa> heh, comic of Fluttershy's reaction to Watership Down

<Luna> 07it's a bit silent
<ValtheJean> 2,14 GHOSTS
<RDash> Everypony's in #help
<Sumica> people are having issues LordCelestia so most are trying to get them fixed or just stay connected.
<LordCelestia> yeah i was too but mines fixed
<WhatPayne> Um. So will you Luna some day start streaming House MD again?
<WhatPayne> Maybe not today, but in say next week, or?
<LordCelestia> I just read part 4 its sweet and it involves LUNA
<DecapKnight> LUNA!
<Kah> wow
<Kah> hey decapknight, you're still on
<DecapKnight> ?
<Kah> you are still on
<LordCelestia> not gonna spoil anything tho
<MrChang> hey
<LordCelestia> hey mrchang
<DecapKnight> 1/3 of the way. why?
<LordCelestia> whatsup?
<Sumica> lol that new comic. made it to spikes comment before i was laughing too hard to continue.
<MrChang> looks like D&D is over
<LordCelestia> oh, why is that?
<MrChang> nobody showed up
<MrChang> xept razyn
<LordCelestia> oh
<WhatPayne> Which comic?
<LordCelestia> well that doesnt mean we dont have later
<LordCelestia> right?
<WhatPayne> Hello? Is this thing on?
<LordCelestia> lol
<Sumica> http://loceri.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Do-you-pee-in-the-Shower-254531814
<Sumica> that comic
<WhatPayne> Pee?
<Wrek> 05oh the hilarity
<WhatPayne> Haha!
<Sumica> yes the title gave me a momment for pause too.
<LordCelestia> Just read it. INSTANT FAV
<WhatPayne> Interesting how House MD teached me that urine is sterile.
<LordCelestia> lmao
<WhatPayne> So I kinda side with Twilight there.
<Mauran> Rainbow Dash Truely Is The Best Pony EVER
<LordCelestia> so if i pee on a cut on my leg, am I cleaning it???
<Mauran> yes
<LordCelestia> awesome
<LordCelestia> :D
<WhatPayne> But also remember that urine is good growth environment for bacteria
<Mauran> its also a mild acid, so it helps neutralise some venoms
<Mauran> if you get stung by an insect in the wild, and you dont have any other options, pee on the sting and it might help neutralise
<WhatPayne> That jellyfish sting pee thing is urban legend. Does not help
<Sumica> thougth that was only for jellyfish stings.
<Mauran> not jellyfish...
<Mauran> bluebottles
<Mauran> same familt
<Mauran> family
<LordCelestia> LMFAO
<Mauran> but different venom
<LordCelestia> THAT MADE MZY DAY
<LordCelestia> "pee on the sting*
<Mauran> it works....
<WhatPayne> Seriously if you pee on jellyfish sting it might even make it worse
<Mauran> ive tried it myself
<LordCelestia> i know its just the way it sounds
<Sumica> I will just stick with the mythbusters methiod of using vodka.
<LordCelestia> BAHAHAH
<SilverMane> is stream up, or is my interwebs durping
<Mauran> Well, ive got an english exam to go to, but ive been sent here for season 2 airing

<SilverMane> 9am EST i hear
<Mauran> ok, and will this have live upload
<SilverMane> so i hear

<SilverMane> speaking of, is there a second airing on Saturday? I probably wil have other plans

*RainBroDash 10clambers to his feet wearily
<RainBroDash> 10Erm, is there any chance we could not fight to the death? I quite enjoy my life
*SilverMane sighs. "Why can't my fillies be normal for once?"
<Dashite_School> I have the dumb.
*`Fluttershy shakes out her flank, starting a stumbling charge
<DecapKnight> "Because its fun to watch Silver"
<Sumica> I am sure you could just share SilverMane
<Apokalipse> This is a fun chat to lurk
<Dashite_School> 19:00 is not 5pm.
*RainBroDash 10widens his stance "Here we go"
<SilverMane> Sumica, frankly it's THEM that need to share
<Dashite_School> I have no idea why I thought that...
<`Fluttershy> I EVEN HAVE BATTLE MUSIC
<`Fluttershy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAeBHMVS4l4

<`Fluttershy> TouHou battle music is not pathetic! >> )
<`Fluttershy> I mean. Sad. )
<`Fluttershy> << )
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Dashite_School> WhatPayne: I lurk 24/7
*`Fluttershy only pushes forward harder with all her might, tears in her eyes "I'm... not... going... to... GIVE IN!!"
<prince-dari> My dad mixing coke and red wine for the lulz.
<prince-dari> It tastes weird.
*SilverMane sits down in the corner, reading a psychology book. "Hopefully they don't kill each other. I'm running low on Phoenix Downs"
<prince-dari> (He earned the nickname 'curle' king' for a reason)
<prince-dari> curdle*
<WhatPayne> I'd lurk 24/7 but I have habit of turning off the computer when I go sleep
*RainBroDash 10takes `Fluttershy's newfound momentum and flips `Fluttershy over his shoulder

<Ghosties> 4PM
<prince-dari> Ohai Polarfire. <333

<RainBroDash> 10mfw dari x polarfire is canon
<Dashite_School> WhatPayne: turning off the computer? Bah!
<RainBroDash> 10I thought it was only in my head
<WhatPayne> I know, I know...
<Dashite_School> If I turned my computer off, I wouldn't be able to run progress quest 24/7 :(
<DecapKnight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XR4rAmYtA
*`Fluttershy groans, then kicks out her back leg. "IT'S NOT OVER!"
<DecapKnight> Fight Music!
<WhatPayne> The what now?
<Polarfire> Rainbro, its been canon for awhile now XD
<RainBroDash> 10`FLUTTERSHY OH COME ON! Can we not make a deal?
<`Fluttershy> "NOOOO" >>
<SilverMane> they sure are, Sumica. *turns a page*
<DecapKnight> "FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!"
*RainBroDash 10is exhausted and exasperated
*Sumica offers SilverMane a taco.
<RainBroDash> 10Fine, a fight it is then.
*SilverMane cries. "I never got to ship with Sexy-Voice though!"
*`Fluttershy glares, standing up and panting
*SilverMane takes the taco, solaced by it. "Thanks Sumica"
<Dashite_School> I'm sitting in on a lecture for a class I've taken twice now.
*RainBroDash 10lets loose a roar and gallops full-pelt at `Fluttershy with newfound enthusiasm
<DecapKnight> "Wait! Can I have in on this fight?"
<Barry> If anyone's interested, here's chapter two of my story.
<Barry> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDl5sgHDuwLaGv_VbCV90Yns3uk1C_KWvrivR6fk4CA/edit?pli=1&hl=en_US
*`Fluttershy eyes widen, but she flies up into the air wearily, dropping as he comes underneath her
<SilverMane> DecapKnight, you want to earn the title of Waifu of Silvermane?
<Sumica> this seems more fitting for this kind of fight.
*RainBroDash 10slaps decapknight around the back of the head "It's bad enough having my throne contested by one pony"
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jkNTPJ11eU

*SilverMane grabs `Fluttershy and RainBroDash by the tails, dragging them off to his private chambers.

<prince-dari> BANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBAN
<SilverMane> BAN HIM
<RainBroDash> 10^^^^^^^
<SilverMane> DO IT NOW
*SilverMane RAGES
<Barry> lol
<prince-dari> Sumica: Nope
<AllisZerofff> Thought I had to at some point
<Sumica> odd
<Wrek> 05whats with my timing?
<SilverMane> GAAAHHH
<Apokalipse> That spoiler totally ruined everything for me :(
<alliszeroffff> Nevermind that, I know I'm going home soon and my nick is gonna get stuck
<Sumica> So dead island kind of reminds me of Jurasic park just with zombies instead of dinosaurs.
<Barry> Jurassic Park 4 may be out by 2013
<prince-dari> 4?
<prince-dari> O_o
<DashWithRainbows> to me, dead island reminds me of dead rising 2, left for dead and borderlands mixed into one game
<prince-dari> *MILK* *MILK* *MILK*
<SilverMane> wait...
<Barry> Yes,4
<SilverMane> they're making another sequel?
<SilverMane> it's been like, 10 yars
<SilverMane> years
<Barry> Not just another sequel, they plan to make a second trilogy
<Sumica> bleh
<Sumica> so who are they gonna write back to life this time?
<alliszeroffff> Lul
<RainBroDash> 10I can't wait for Starcraft 3 in 2023
<Barry> no clue
<alliszeroffff> Godzilla
<RainBroDash> 10tis gonna be epic
<Barry> huh?
<Zephirdd> lol sc3
<Barry> why do you think it'll be out 12 years from now?
<WhatPayne> I hated Jurassic Park II
<Zephirdd> because sc1 and sc2
<Sumica> 2 more or less killed it
<Zephirdd> took 12 years
<alliszeroffff> ^
<WhatPayne> Because I read the book first
<Zephirdd> lol
<Zephirdd> every movie based on books
<Zephirdd> sucks when compared to the book
<Zephirdd> I mean, see HP and the Half Blood Prince
<WhatPayne> Yeah but it does not have to be like that.
<Zephirdd> then you'd need two parts for each book, and it would still be weird
<Zephirdd> (see HP and the deathly hallows)
<Sumica> I ratehr liked the first JP movie even after reading the book.
<Barry> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was dull anyway, even as a book
<prince-dari> Meh, I like all the HP books.
<Zephirdd> they fucking cut off the fighting scene of the book from the movie
<prince-dari> More than the films too, even though I love the films.
<Zephirdd> instead of badass fight with blood
<Zephirdd> they just broke glasses and set something on fire
<RainBroDash> 10ITT: people dissecting entertainment to an unnecessary level instead of just enjoying it
<Barry> Deathly Hallows was probably one of the dullest movies made.
<WhatPayne> Michael Crichton The lost world was really good. And somehow Spielberg took all the good things away from the adaptation
<prince-dari> Lol RainBro.
<Zephirdd> RainBroDash: this is no topic, this is chat u silly :d
<prince-dari> Fair enough.
<prince-dari> I agree.
*RainBroDash 10was just stirring shit
<WhatPayne> And added that dumb sequence where the T-rex goes to San Diego.
<WhatPayne> ughh...
<RainBroDash> 10I do believe what I said, but I only like to say it because it gets people riled up sometimes

<RainBroDash> 10baibaaiii
<alliszeroffff> My biggest achilles heel as computer guy is
<alliszeroffff> Having blue screens of death, where the blue screens don't actually have any information on the problem that caused them
<`FlutterBro> hi
<alliszeroffff> You can debug the shit out of a minidump file all you want, but if you need to distill them driver by driver, you're better off doing a clean install
<`FlutterBro> for some reason I can't use just FlutterBro
<SilverMane> if any of you are having trouble logging into your name, go to #help
<alliszeroffff> Welp there goes my battery

<prince-dari> In the sky.
<ChrisClark13> in another pineapple
<`Fluttershy> THERE ARE NO BANANAS IN THE SKY

<`Fluttershy> I LIKE BANANAS TOO
*RainBroDash 10was afk, comes back being requested for pomf, and reportedly living in a pineapple in a pineapple in the sky

<DashWithRainbows> im eating some dragon fruit
<DashWithRainbows> better than watermelon?
<ChrisClark13> Hey, had anyone here won the internet?
<ChrisClark13> has*)
<SilverMane> pomf is the sound effect of wings unfurling rapidly in arousal
<GGgala> pomf is the sound of hitting a pillow while being seduced
<SilverMane> aka pomf = Wingboner
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<RainBroDash> 10^

<Reaver21> Testing 1-2-3. :megusta:
<ChrisClark13> I have minecraft, terraria, MH3 and generally anything free to play. No FPSs sorry
<DashWithRainbows> >got minecraft, mosy play shooters but enjoys Command and conquer games
<DashWithRainbows> mostly*
<Reaver21> ugh. Is the Bronystate.net stream up? Or all they all down? And why do I feel so alone in this chat here?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 stream is down, yes
<DashWithRainbows> trust me its better on friday night and will be even better on season 2 stream
<Reaver21> I see. I thought maybe my computer was being retarded :/
<ChrisClark13> I just want to do something fun with some of you guys.
<ChrisClark13> so bored;
<Sumica> yes Val. audio spliter seems to want to piss me off today.
<Ziltoid> When does the marethon start?
<Reaver21> Sooooo.....how about them Minecrafts? 1.8 seems...fun. It's a lot more laggy now, though. My average FPS is in the 50's now..
<WhatPayne> Yeah Reaver21, spme times I too have to check if i'm getting through. I guess it's the nature of this chat.
<ChrisClark13> 1.8.1? sure I'll do that.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah... my FPS dropped a whole ton after upgrading to 1.8
<Ziltoid> I dont have minecraft
<DashWithRainbows> same here Robot
<RobotPinkie> I'm guessing it's the new world generation code
<Reaver21> That's right, ChrisClark13. I even just updated and forgot about it lol
<RobotPinkie> It's a lot more elaborate
<ChrisClark13> Mine too.
<DashWithRainbows> though i run it on laptop and am hoping of gettin a job to by a good computer
<ChrisClark13> yep
<ChrisClark13> thats the sprit!
<RobotPinkie> The new biomes look crazy awesome
<ChrisClark13> whos hosting?
<Reaver21> Well, if you guys ever host a server that doesn't have the Valid-ID check or whatever, go ahead and tell me now :D I R a pirate!
<DashWithRainbows> well im off guys,
<DashWithRainbows> cya
<Reaver21> Ciao Dash!
<ChrisClark13> so anyone here gonna Minecraft with me? I'll start a server...
<SilverMane> Luna, you troll
<Reaver21> As long as it's not secured, I'll join. I'll need an IP though obviously~
<ChrisClark13> ...minecraft.net is freaking out on me.
<Reaver21> I wouldn't know, My copy is illegitimate~
<Sumica> MYRIKA!
<RobotPinkie> Does anyone know what the experience levels do at the moment?
<Reaver21> Robotpinkie, I have no clue~
<ChrisClark13> nothing!
<Sumica> ok every one geting sound and video now?
<RobotPinkie> oh there's stream?
<herospirit> Who's playing
<Reaver21> I'm attempting now.
<ChrisClark13> I'm getting both
*Sumica waves
<herospirit> Sumica, you are the man
<ChrisClark13> go pwn something!
<herospirit> This game has a really good story :0
<herospirit> ...And really long
<Reaver21> :eeyup: I'm in
<herospirit> :D
<ChrisClark13> eeyup
<herospirit> *4-disk game nostalgia*
<Reaver21> Or not. Now the chat is weird. I like bunnies.
<wingless> testing
<herospirit> Wait, fuck, I'm not old enough for nostalgia
<WhatPayne> Yeah, it's slightly unclear to me, is there some "ban" for shows being streamed, or what?
<Reaver21> Yay! It works!
<Sumica> we dont want to risk it geting shutdown so close to s2
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's better to play it safe
<Reaver21> Wait, what's this about bans and whatnot?
<RobotPinkie> Ahhh
<RobotPinkie> That makes sense.
<ChrisClark13> ooh cutscene!
<herospirit> mfw ps1 graphics that can hold ground with modern movies
<WhatPayne> Ah... Did I miss it, or was this explained somewhere because I've been wondering this throughout the whole day here...
<herospirit> GOOOOOD I LOVE THIS GAME.
<herospirit> This is my childhood :0
<ChrisClark13> ooh, weird mounts
<Reaver21> Whatpayne, you know more than I do..
<WhatPayne> Apparently not, as I just heard this.
<herospirit> You have yo admit, these graphics are more than amazing for ps1 graphics
<herospirit> to*
<Sumica> Gah forgot about the dualshock vibrating.
<ChrisClark13> wonder how long it took to render the cutscenes
<herospirit> The music
<Reaver21> No, I don't even really know what "it" is!And HeroSpirit, these are all pre-rendered. It's a video.
<herospirit> OH THE MUSIC
<herospirit> I know.
<ChrisClark13> I know its pre-rendered, but I'm just wondering how long they took the first time.
<herospirit> But most ps1 cutscenes weren't that good. At least not in the games I played. :0
<Reaver21> So they aren't actually PS1 graphics, but rather.. PC graphics.
<WhatPayne> Reaver21: What it you mean?
<WhatPayne> "it"
<Reaver21> In reference to something about the stream being banned or something and "playing it safe".
<herospirit> Blarglblarg I'm still nerding out over this, I'm sorry
<ChrisClark13> no voiceovers?
<Reaver21> Oh, no, it's cool Herospirit. In fact, I blame chat lag for my responses.
<herospirit> I want a remake of this game. And a movie. And a sequel...
<herospirit> And a chain of tiny tea cups
<herospirit> And....
<SilverMane> MFW
<herospirit> Oh gog I'm draw some Dragoon ponies!
<herospirit> I'ma*
<Reaver21> So, I'ma ask this question and then leave. Is the Season 2 premiere AM or PM?
<herospirit> AM
<herospirit> Saturday morning
<ChrisClark13> that's a "dragon?"
<Reaver21> Thanks! I thought so :D
<Reaver21> Ciao, mah bronies!
<WhatPayne> Yeah I and many others been asking about the stream throughout the day as we often get these minor streams by Luna and others. And I suppose I missed someone at some point explaining the reason there would not be any "copyrighted" streams today due not wanting to risk it this close to season 2.
<VioletVanilla> 6Take care Reaver21!
<herospirit> Yah, dragon
<WhatPayne> And he just leaves as I'm about to explain where we (I) stand...
<herospirit> lol
<herospirit> SHOT DOWN, Payne
<mib_34zkdc> Huh. What game is that?
<WhatPayne> :(
<mib_34zkdc> On the stream
<herospirit> "Legend of the Dragoon"
<ChrisClark13> legend of dragoon
<herospirit> It is my childhood. :3
<herospirit> Oh yah, no "the"
<WhatPayne> I feel so cold shouldered right now...
<ChrisClark13> hop that fence like a man!
<herospirit> The fighting is... really unique for an RPG
<EspyLacopa> Huh. An odd new game is being streamed?
<herospirit> An odd old game
<herospirit> This game was my favorite. EVAR.
<Sumica> oh right quick time fighting
<EspyLacopa> What the hay. My password for this nick isn't working.
<herospirit> ...And I've decided I should make ponies of the characters
<Luna> 07that's correct Espy
<EspyLacopa> To the help channel!
<herospirit> The major part of the fighting in this is that you can get different quick time combos
<herospirit> The higher level ones are stronger, but have much harder timing
<herospirit> :0

<RobotPinkie> Yeah, getting a bit of lag when the movement speeds up.
<SilverMane> Well I'll watch and see if i want to pick it up sometime
<Sumica> hard to time these thru the pc >_<
<herospirit> It's especially fun when you get your Dragoon powers :3
<ChrisClark13> you're playing this on a pc screen?
<RobotPinkie> I think it looks pretty hot
<ChrisClark13> lag
<herospirit> Tasman: "Need practice? Come stab me repetitively!"
<RobotPinkie> oh god, accidentally paused the stream, lol

<SilverMane> `Fluttershy, I don't think you need ME to tell you how much I love you >>
<RainBroDash> 10ITT `Fluttershy is basking in glory :3
<SilverMane> always squeaking and doesn't afraid of anything

<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, is it hole?
<EspyLacopa> Oh no! A man in a hood!
<prince-dari> Oh, I didn't think of that.
<prince-dari> But nope.
<SilverMane> HOLY
<prince-dari> Basking in the glory (hole) doesn't really work anyway.
<SilverMane> did he died?
<prince-dari> :P
<RobotPinkie> I find that offensive :P
<ChrisClark13> you wasted 10 points of potion!
<SilverMane> >.>
<Cranberry_Scotch> Out of the "Mane" 6, who would you be most inclined to kiss? It would be Twilight for me, I guess.
<prince-dari> >impying I would kiss a pony
<SilverMane> I'd be most inclined to kiss...
<Natleyn> ^
<SilverMane> honestly, Twilight as well
<RobotPinkie> >implying you wouldn't if it were Dash
<herospirit> Could be a kiss on the head or something
<Cranberry_Scotch> Doesn't have to be their pony form
<SilverMane> Fluttershy I just want to hug, pinkie pie frankly would buck me if i tried probably
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >implying a pony would WANT to be kissed by you Dari :P
<herospirit> He never said Sloppy Makeouts
<SilverMane> (the good kind of buck)
<prince-dari> I don't like to think about kissing non-real things in any form.
<prince-dari> :P
<Zephirdd> >mfw there is no banana phone PMV :C
<RobotPinkie> lawl
<SilverMane> lawl
<ChrisClark13> lol at the lawls
<SilverMane> mfw you are attacking a... mouse
<Zacoda> A little imagination never hurts Prince-Dari
<Zacoda> XD
<prince-dari> HAhaha
<ChrisClark13> it can
<prince-dari> I misread the character's name as Dari
<RainBroDash> 10"<RobotPinkie>: >implying you wouldn't if it were Dash "
<RainBroDash> 10^that
<SilverMane> hmm
<SilverMane> this reminds me of FF7 quite a bit right now
<herospirit> *kills field mouse* "I AM SO MAN" *fist pump*
<Sumica> lol
<RobotPinkie> Yeah it does look pretty much like a PSX era FF game
<Cranberry_Scotch> I flying mouse attacks you, herospirit
<SilverMane> a midget and a turkey this time
<Cranberry_Scotch> A flying mouse*
<ChrisClark13> fight harder!
<herospirit> I see your point Scotch
<ChrisClark13> yeah!
<Sumica> suddely retrospective
<ChrisClark13> boxy box!
<Cranberry_Scotch> What point did I make?
<BakedMacintosh> I almost thought it was one lol
<Ghosties> 4Whoa
<MeteorVenture> guys stop talking about kissing ponies.. you're going to get someone else to starting thinking about it and eventually it'll actually start happening until we realize it's just our imagination and all we were kissing is whoever was right next to us which is usually a bro
<Ghosties> 4Deja vu
<Cranberry_Scotch> lol
<ChrisClark13> cute!
<SilverMane> wtf?
<RobotPinkie> >implying that it's wrong to kiss a bro
<SilverMane> did that dog just... yell at him?
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<herospirit> Hahaha, I love the voice of the next person to join your party
<prince-dari> LOL
<herospirit> "Har-POOOOOOOOOOOON"
<prince-dari> "LEAVE SHANA ALONE!"
<BakedMacintosh> oh wow
<herospirit> "LEAVE SHANA ALONE"
<herospirit> "I MEAN IT"
<SilverMane> LEAVE BRITTANY ALONE
<RobotPinkie> Shana is the Britney of this game, I take it.
<MeteorVenture> >implying you want to robot
<SilverMane> lawl ILU guys
<RobotPinkie> >yes
<MeteorVenture> >implying i even know you anymore
<ChrisClark13> he sounds so japanese
<herospirit> Big ass stone throw
<RobotPinkie> >except I'm already spoken for
<MeteorVenture> >> <<
*SilverMane glomps RobotPinkie. "I can fix that"
<RobotPinkie> You can fix what, SilverMane? :P
<ChrisClark13> wth
<MeteorVenture> >implying robots aren't always spoken for
<ChrisClark13> laaaaaaaaaaaaggggg
<RobotPinkie> >wat?
<SilverMane> RobotPinkie, i can fix being spoken for.
<Sumica> #$^$*@& even magic is quick time.
<SilverMane> want to enter the Silver's Waifu competition?
<RobotPinkie> Haha, oh okay. How are you going to fix that, SilverMane? :P
<herospirit> Murder
<herospirit> obviously
<DecapKnight> is there another fight?
<prince-dari> herospirit: LOL, that was my first thought too
<RobotPinkie> I think RBD might kill me if I do
*SilverMane licks RobotPinkie's cheek
<SilverMane> >.>
<prince-dari> Which cheek?
<prince-dari> Do ho ho
<RobotPinkie> ....
<herospirit> O u
<SilverMane> I think rainBroDash is open to suggestions
<ChrisClark13> ...
<ChrisClark13> I like the bronystate logo
<SilverMane> :D
<RobotPinkie> I don't know, that one time Steven_Magnet paired me with Apple Fritter...
*SilverMane is the resident lover-colt.
<ChrisClark13> I looks like its a part of the game on the world map
*DecapKnight is the residential metal head
<RobotPinkie> I'm the resident... uh... no idea actually...
<SilverMane> well that was Apple Fritter
*prince-dari is the resident troll
*Natleyn is the resident... something. Cursor maker? >_>
<SilverMane> everypony has one or two ponies that they would hold above me
<SilverMane> THE MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE UNDERSTANDS
<Sumica> Sounds kinky SilverMane
<SilverMane> >.>
<SilverMane> only half the time Sumica
<MeteorVenture> this isn't a water hose
<prince-dari> TM&MS
*RobotPinkie goes to the closet to get the bag of ropes, straps and whips
<prince-dari> This game looks kind of like Digimon World for PS1
<ChrisClark13> how BA do the characters get?
<prince-dari> RainBroDash
<prince-dari> You think?
<RobotPinkie> ...just kidding
<SilverMane> yes SEXIEST VOICE IN EQUESTRIA PRINCE-DARI?
<RobotPinkie> >.>
*Sumica fails at stealth
<RobotPinkie> <.<
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, Digimon World 1 was HARD as fuck
<prince-dari> Just bring you a smoothie
<prince-dari> bringing*
<SilverMane> how can they make such HARD games for kids?
<prince-dari> Yeah, it was hard.
<ChrisClark13> lack of playtesters?
<prince-dari> Not ending up with the turdmon digimon was pretty tough.
<RobotPinkie> Man, I'm kinda glad he missed that
<MeteorVenture> cause kids are better at them than older people who don't play games
<SilverMane> half the games for kids back then were impossible
<prince-dari> Never knew where the next toilet was. >_>
<RobotPinkie> Yeah
*herospirit leaves for a few seconds
<RobotPinkie> I mean compare the Genesis games I played as a kid with the games today...
*herospirit comes back
<SilverMane> Spyro 1, Crash Bandicoot 1, Croc 1, Digimon World 1...
*herospirit sees "RobotPinkie goes to the closet to get the bag of ropes, straps and whips"
<prince-dari> SPYRO <3
<herospirit> ........
<MeteorVenture> i grew up with them so i'm the ownage.. but if i hadn't.. if i hadn't....
<prince-dari> Croc
<prince-dari> Oh yeah
<prince-dari> Damn that was a hard game.
<BakedMacintosh> Crash 1 was quite hard to beat...
<prince-dari> Anyone here remember Gex?
<RobotPinkie> I was kidding, herospirit, I swear I wasn't going to use any of that on SilverMane!
<MeteorVenture> i do
<prince-dari> That game was great. XD
<BakedMacintosh> indeed
<SilverMane> i remember Gex
<MeteorVenture> that game was kinda difficult
<RobotPinkie> I remember Chakan the Forever Man
<prince-dari> PS1
*Natleyn gets some of his own rope and makes a hanging chair, sittin' in it
<prince-dari> Oh the nostalgia
<RobotPinkie> ...that was pretty hard
<SilverMane> wait, robotPinkie, you have ropes?
<RobotPinkie> ......no comment
*ChrisClark13 is floating
<SilverMane> Spyro was BAMF
<RobotPinkie> :P
<herospirit> ..............
<Natleyn> All the rope
<Natleyn> ALL OF IT
*herospirit opens robotPinkie's closet
<herospirit> ..............
<prince-dari> I remember one of the levels in Spyro 1 had an insane bit to get to.
*herospirit closes RobottPinkie's closet
<herospirit> No comment.
<ChrisClark13> why are we in RobotPinkie's house?
<RobotPinkie> ...don't tell anyone what you've seen today, herospirit
<Natleyn> I'm in the chatroom. :<
<herospirit> No one will no
<DecapKnight> I will
<herospirit> know*
<DecapKnight> I will
<herospirit> ....
<Cranberry_Scotch> What's this?
<Natleyn> It has, like, a fireplace and rafters and stuff.
<RobotPinkie> I am 12 and what is this?
<prince-dari> You had to use the superspeed thing and zoom round half the map before flying off the edge into what looks as though it can hold nothing but death, before gliding far enough you reach a platform round a curve, so it's hidden from site during normal observation.
<prince-dari> It was INSANE.
<prince-dari> I loved it though.
<prince-dari> It was epic.
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, I think I remember that
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, in the 5th world?
<BakedMacintosh> oh god I remember that part. -_-
<prince-dari> Can't remember which level exactly.
<MeteorVenture> ya i remember that.. it took a while for us to find lol
<RobotPinkie> Man, I kinda miss games being harder...
<prince-dari> All I remember was you could hear the dragon statue through a wall.
<SilverMane> dear god, i was 17 before i could 100% Spyro and Crash Bandicoot
<prince-dari> And I was just wondering, hwo the fuck do I get there?
<prince-dari> how*
<RobotPinkie> I mean part of what makes things easier is infinite lives and frequent checkpoints, though.
<prince-dari> Took forever to work out.
<SilverMane> yeah, it was pure guess work that got me to it on my 100% run
<prince-dari> BASTARD!!
<prince-dari> FOAL!
<herospirit> Gog, those gaurds look like RobotPinkie's closet
<ChrisClark13> wee! looting!
<MeteorVenture> pretty much what silvermane said but when i did 100% crash bandicoot 2 i did it within a day lol
<SilverMane> FOOL
<herospirit> Errrr
<SilverMane> FOALS!
<herospirit> I mean
<herospirit> ....
<herospirit> No comment
<RobotPinkie> NO herospirit!
<SilverMane> crash Bandicoot 2 wasn't hard
<SilverMane> crash bandicoot 1 was a BITCH
<MeteorVenture> it was for a kid who didn't know junk
<ChrisClark13> take everything that's not nailed down!
<SilverMane> you could not die ONCe
<RobotPinkie> My secret dungeon must never be revealed!
<BakedMacintosh> Other crashes were cake compared to the first
<RobotPinkie> ...oops
<EspyLacopa> Psychonauts?
<SilverMane> and you had to find hidden tokens to get into hidden areas
<MeteorVenture> i mean i couldn't figure out what i needed to know apparently.. i still don't know what it was i needed to know
<Razyn> Psychonauts?
<Razyn> What?
<Natleyn> Dang it Pontang
<RobotPinkie> Psychonauts?
<DecapKnight> Saints Row 3?
<RobotPinkie> I love Psychonauts
<MeteorVenture> bandicoot 1 couldn't be that hard.. and i stick to that
<`Fluttershy> ChrisClark13 CHECK PM
<DecapKnight> Fallout 2?
<prince-dari> Prince of Persia Spyro crossover
<prince-dari> FUND IT
<RobotPinkie> My favorite part is inside the mind of the giant fish.
<RobotPinkie> It's so goddamn funny
<DecapKnight> My favorite part is when i go and blow up that oil rig
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari... DO IT
<MeteorVenture> anyone remember kickle cubicle?
<RobotPinkie> PoP is a pretty cool guy.
<DecapKnight> anyone remember Fallout 2?
<Natleyn> I've heard a lot of people talk about playing it, but never played it myself, MeteorVenture
<RobotPinkie> Eh gets impaled on spikes and doesn't afraid of anything
<MeteorVenture> huh.. i've never heard anyone talk about it until i searched for it but i've played it myself lol
<DecapKnight> no one here remembers Fallout 2?
<RobotPinkie> I kinda do, DecapKnight
<Natleyn> Decap: my bro plays F2. >_>
<RobotPinkie> It's been a long time, though
<MeteorVenture> it's a really great puzzle game though:D one of my favorites
<DecapKnight> what about Fallout?
<RobotPinkie> Brotherhood of Steel is the best Fallout, clearly
<RobotPinkie> trololololo
<DecapKnight> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<DecapKnight> that thing should be nuked from orbit
<Razyn> Spears are cool

<prince-dari> Yeah, it was terrible.
<RobotPinkie> For what game?

<prince-dari> Insert generic Brony here.
<prince-dari> Ohai Mark
<Zephirdd> huh oh
<SilverMane> MeteroVenture, no thanks. FF8 was... no fun whatsoever for me
<Zephirdd> who made the banner
<Natleyn> Bahamut was a bitch to get in 8 >_>
<Zephirdd> on Eqd?
<mib_nciwxc> So, I was banned the other day, but this is uber easy to hack
<Zephirdd> about bronystate
<SilverMane> and I did beat FF9, only FF I have beaten
<Zephirdd> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RFAzMkTwThs/TnJ4LjjzVKI/AAAAAAAAA8A/5_b_ZtkbzJI/s1600/Newsletter_Thursday.jpg
<prince-dari> The banner.
<Zephirdd> this one
<prince-dari> Let me check.
<RobotPinkie> Argh, I hope I can pick up that sewing machine this weekend
<MeteorVenture> le gasp! FF8 was pretty equal to 7 for me
<RobotPinkie> I'm seriously in need of sewing some tiny dresses
<EspyLacopa> I can't bring myself to play through 7 /or/ 8 again.
<Natleyn> ^what
<EspyLacopa> Did it once.
<Zephirdd> because the times GMT are wrong, aren't they?
<Brony> Im trying to get pink pinkie pie shirts
<Zephirdd> Since its daylight saving time atm
<Natleyn> > mfw "sewing some tiny dresses"
<RobotPinkie> For ponies, Natleyn :P
<MeteorVenture> ok silvermane.. play legend of legaia then
<Zephirdd> 7pm EST would be 11pm GMT0
<SilverMane> If they ever remake ff7, i'll get it, but until then I won't touch it
<SilverMane> never again
<prince-dari> Zephirdd: I think it was SilverScreen
<Natleyn> Oh.
<RobotPinkie> I can't right now, because I have no sewing machine
<prince-dari> Val did our logo in the bottom left though
<SilverMane> MeteorVenture, i can't afford this long-rpg shit right now!
<prince-dari> Oh wait.
<sixthgate> wtf are we watching
<Zephirdd> just pointing out the times are wrong :P
<prince-dari> No, Val did the newsletter.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, I don't think we put it in there
<EspyLacopa> Technically, the times are correct. However, you have to adjust for EDT, so when it says it starts at 7 PM EST, therefore it means for us eastern people on daylight savings, it starts at 8 PM.
<prince-dari> Silver typed it up.
<SilverMane> I have Dark Souls, Dead Island, Skyrim, Uncharted 3, Deus Ex, and so many others to get and play
<Natleyn> Legend of Dragoon.
<sixthgate> ah
<Natleyn> ^Ho shit
<MeteorVenture> ok ok sheesh all you had to do was write an angry letter
<prince-dari> Val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah?
<Natleyn> Nice backup, Silvermane
<prince-dari> You made the newsletter didn't you?
<Rainbow-Dash> You went ahead and got Dead Island Silvermane?
<Zephirdd> yes, its EDT
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah...that was me
<prince-dari> And the logo
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<SudsNBubbles> Hello
<prince-dari> Thought so.
<Rainbow-Dash> Oh wait.. Didnt read that right.. Nvm >.<
<SilverMane> Rainbow-Dash, I went to, but the stores were sold out
<prince-dari> And also Silver got the GMT times right.
<RobotPinkie> STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!
<SilverMane> i actually watched the last one get sold at Best Buy
<SilverMane> but I did get Deus Ex
<Natleyn> RobotPinkie: <3

<herospirit> Then you can cross over the tree, across the river
<Sumica> ah ok
<Natleyn> I wanna hear "Die more and more!"
<Natleyn> >_>
<herospirit> ...and why do I still remember this, I haven't played this in like 6 years
<ANON> what game is this..
<Natleyn> Just jump kick it
<EspyLacopa> Kick the tree!
<Natleyn> Legend of Dragoon
<herospirit> Legend of Dragoon
<herospirit> NNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTT
*Natleyn hugs herospirit
<EspyLacopa> Does this game have dragons in it?
<Natleyn> Hrm.
<Sumica> yes
<herospirit> Lol :p
<herospirit> And Dragoons. Which are different than dragons.
<herospirit> :D
<EspyLacopa> Well, yes.
<EspyLacopa> Dragoons have spears.
<herospirit> Different kind of Dragoon :P
<EspyLacopa> And know the secret on how to Jump Good.
<Sumica> and swords and bows
<`Fluttershy> `FlutterBro
*Nat hugs EspyLacopa
<Nat> dat reference.
<Sumica> sam r he jack
<MeteorVenture> was there ever any sleep?
<RobotPinkie> Faust seems to have a lot of faith in Thiessen
<EspyLacopa> MeteorVenture: In your dreams.
<RobotPinkie> Awesome
<ANON> ...i thought dragoons were just mounted foot soldiers.......im TERRIBLE at history....
<herospirit> Anon, we were going by video games :p
<EspyLacopa> ANON: If you want to get /historical/ about it, sure.
<Nat> Dragoons are like, the beast killing elite of the fantasy world
<MeteorVenture> i thought dragoons were like lizard-men things with spears
<SilverMane> mfw everyone is right
<Nat> Huntin' dragons an' shit and jumpin' all over the damn place
<ANON> im so confused at the moment
<Bommster> I'm pretty sure dragoons are mounted guys with guns
<Bommster> RISE OF NATIONS IS HISTORICALLY ACCURATE SHUT UP
<ANON> I LOVE THAT GAME
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<ANON> ok sorry
<RobotPinkie> I thought dragoons were the guys with the "jump" command
<SilverMane> A dragoon in Real Life was a mounted warrior of elite status. In video games, it is many things, including a spear warrior that can jump, a lizard man, a magical hero, etc etc etc
<Alpha> What time CST tomorrow is the show?
<MeteorVenture> haha pinkie
<herospirit> Obviously Dragoons are an ancient race of dragon riders
<herospirit> Geez
<EspyLacopa> Do they fight the Thread?
<herospirit> That can shoot magic and shit.
<Nat> Nice catch!
<herospirit> ...and shit as in they do stuff, not that they shoot shit from their hands
<ANON> did they fly dragons from skyrim (its not out yet though.....)
<herospirit> that would be gross
<Buraddo> when season two start?
<RobotPinkie> Thread?
<Nat> ^'course
<Nat> SUDDENLY, TREE
<EspyLacopa> RobotPinkie: Ah, not familiar with that book series eh?
<prince-dari> We'd better get the good version of the CMC song some time.
<RobotPinkie> I'd like to be a tree...
<herospirit> Oh god
<Nat> Dari: Indeed.
<RobotPinkie> Nope, EspyLacopa
<herospirit> YOU CUT DOWN FLUTTERSHY
<herospirit> CUT DOWN IN HER PRIME
<Nat> Y U DO DIS
<EspyLacopa> Dragonriders of Pern
<Starburst> I don't even know what the thread is and I've read those books
<Starburst> It falls off a moon or something?
<Sumica> muhahaha
<Starburst> It doesn't make much sense.

<Zephirdd> "I will admit I still check in on EqD almost every day, and I checked Ponychan when episodes premiered to get feedback. I consider them very valuable resources - and, frankly, fun! I also admit Ive occasionally contributed to discussions, and Ive even dropped a few spoilers for fun - yay for anonymity! I totally lurk, guys...so careful what you say! ;)"

<Starburst> Oooooooooh

<RobotPinkie> but spoilers are still instant permaban!

<Zephirdd> lol
<MeteorVenture> ohhh ok thanks

<Zephirdd> :P
<Flootershai> Oh herro.

*Nat hugs Flootershai

<Nat> DE MAGIKS.
<Flootershai> Oh, I has a question.
<KanyeEast> oh hey, legend of dragoon

*Dermathil walks in the chatroom, a boombox blaring "Your horoscope for today" by Weird Al on his shoulder.
<MeteorVenture> so when someone asks...
<Nat> Well hello Dermathil
<Flootershai> Um, does the "live showing" include season 2 episode 1? I don't has cable and I want to watch it asap :3

<Surprise> Alright thanks Zephir
*Dermathil waves at Ghosties, continuing to stroll around Doctor House-style.
<herospirit> I love this game. I've been nerding out about it all day.
<Zephirdd> a member of bronystate will stream directly from their TV
<Zephirdd> idk how

<Flootershai> workz for me!
<Flootershai> xD
<Nightstorm> >.>
<Zephirdd> >mfw I don't remember the Hub streamer
<Dermathil> Zephirdd: I'm pretty sure they use the technology that makes people able to make livestreams of them playing console games.
<Flootershai> just wanted to make sure what all the hubub was about
<Flootershai> i will see you all on Saturday at 9:00am!
<Zephirdd> no

<Ghosties> 4@herospirit: Only the demo
<Flootershai> *bronystate added to bookmarks*
<Dermathil> good luck, Flootershai. I read Catcher in the Rye for school myself a year ago.
<Zephirdd> she's gone
<Dermathil> eeeeeeeeh
<Sebiale> OMG, Legend of Dragoon. This is not something I expected to find today.
<KanyeEast> holden caufield makes hamlet look like a badass action hero
<Sebiale> I love this game.
<Dermathil> >mfw Bronystate has broken the 50-viewer cap on an off-movie night.
<Zephirdd> lol
<Zephirdd> rly?
<Zephirdd> :O
<Sumica> I blame the eqd post
<mib_f9cyn9> like a bau5
<Sebiale> It's because of the Season 1 marathon announcement :P
<Zephirdd> true
<Dermathil> Same here, Sumica.
<Dermathil> indeed
<Sumica> FFFFFFFFFF random encounter just outside town
<Nari> it's THE STAREEEE
<Sebiale> What are you playing Sumica?
<Sumica> what you see
<Nari> Legend of Dragoon o-o
<Dermathil> I hope we'll get to keep the massive ammount of viewers that's gonna come down tomorrow for the other movie nights.
<Nari> He's streamin'.
<mib_f9cyn9> So what am I watching here?
<Sebiale> Ah, IC
<Sebiale> Legend of Dragoon
<Nari> egh.
<Sebiale> I wish they would remake this game with better visuals. They could keep everything else the same.
<Sebiale> It would still be awesome.
<Nyst> So long as they get anounced ahead of time I'll be there.
<Nittany_Tiger> Going home.
<Nari> Seeya soon, nittany
<Sebiale> Hey, Sumica, you playing this on the playstation, or virtual machine? PC?
<LordCelestia> HEy guys im back
<LordCelestia> :D
<Sumica> ps2 routed through capture card
<`FlutterBro> hi
<LordCelestia> is my little sister here?
<KanyeEast> you're sort of breezing through this, this is a jrpg dude. you got to put in the mandatory 30 hours of grind
<Sebiale> Ah (actually has no idea what that means :P Was always more of a PC guy than console).
<Sebiale> LoD has almost zero grind.
<Sebiale> Well, maybe near the end, if you want to beat the Original Dragoons.
<Sharpe> GRETTINGS BRONYSTATE
<Sumica> I kinda want to jump to my old save cause it has dragoons already.
<Sebiale> Those dudes are touch.
<Nyst> only doing 1 damage?
<Slowter> 1 dmg makes all the difference
<Dermathil> hello Sharpe
<Sharpe> What game is this anywho?
<LordCelestia> hello Sharpe as well
<FreezeFrame> Oooh, Legend of Dragoon being streamed?
<LordCelestia> game?
<Dermathil> yes, FreezeFrame.
<Sebiale> I know FF, awesome right?
<Sumica> yes FreezeFrame
*FreezeFrame loads the stream
<LordCelestia> yes!
<LordCelestia> right?
<Nari> Luna has gone to sleep.
<Surprise> I'm getting an off-air thing o.O
<poniesyo> it says broadcast is offline for me. is this the site where s2 premier will be streamed?
<FreezeFrame> yes
<LordCelestia> aw, ill see her tomorrow then
<FreezeFrame> You're on bronystate.net correct?
<SchrodingerFu> Why are we watching someone play FF7?
<Surprise> Uh dinkypage.com/bronystate
<poniesyo> yeah i am on same
<KanyeEast> lol oh you schrodingerfu
<FreezeFrame> We aren't
<Surprise> Soooo we should go to bronystate.net?
<Dashite> Yes
<FreezeFrame> It's Legend of Dragoon, which is infinitely superior to FF7
<Surprise> Okay then, brb
<mib_5vdrhi> Is this game the Legend of Dragoon?
<Nari> Yes.
<Sebiale> LoD is probably the best JRPG I ever played, but I've only played a few JRPGs.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Well, I just watched Fusion Reborn on Nicktoons, and surprisingly, it was almost completely uncut
<mib_5vdrhi> I knew it!
<Sebiale> Golden Sun might be a contender.
<Sumica> Oh the irony for you all when this game was made in the US
<FreezeFrame> I need to finish Dark Dawn
<Sebiale> Golden Sun and its sequel were pretty good.
<poniesyo> okay, i am on bronystate.net/theatre/ that is for s2 premier?
<Slowter> Snap, really?!? This was made in the U.S.?
<FreezeFrame> Sebiale: I consider GS and GS: TLA a single game in two parts
<Cranberry_Scotch> And by that, I mean the only thing missing was everything concerning the character known only as the General.
<Sebiale> Yeah, LoD Was made in the US, but it uses the JRPG gameplay standards.
<Slowter> Sweet, learn something new every day
<KanyeEast> you'd think that people would want to make fun of hitler
<Surprise> And im back
<KanyeEast> why do censors protect hitler so much?
<Sebiale> Huh?
<Zephirdd> wat
<KanyeEast> cranberry was talking about a dbz movie
<KanyeEast> with hitler in it
<Dermathil> >mfw reading the Q&A with Lauren Faust I notice that she says she lurks on EqD everyday
<Zephirdd> there is a dbz movie with hitler?
<Nari> ^yup
<Zephirdd> WAT.
<KanyeEast> its called fusion reborn, basically all the bad guys come back to life
<Cranberry_Scotch> The syndicated release cuts him out
<Slowter> Godwin's Law is universal
<KanyeEast> so hitler comes back and trunks and goten troll him
<Cranberry_Scotch> but he's in the uncut dvd
<Zephirdd> ah
<Zephirdd> lol
<Cranberry_Scotch> Yes
<Zephirdd> gotta dl that
<Zephirdd> sounds interesting
<Dermathil> >mfw Lauren Faust dropped some spoilers on EqD for fun as an anon before...
<KanyeEast> if Lauren Faust is off the main production staff I wonder if she reads fanfics
<Zephirdd> whats the name of that movie?
<KanyeEast> Fusion Reborn
<Zephirdd> Trollen Faust is Trollin
<Dermathil> KanyeEast: maybe...
<Lightning_Flicker> She says she doesn't really have time for that, KayneEast.
<FreezeFrame> Ah, one of the few games where attack items are cool
<EmperorJessica> Trollin'
<Zephirdd> she doesn't have time for fics
<FreezeFrame> You think Faust is gonna get her Galaxy Girls pitch picked up?
<Zephirdd> but she did admit to spoil some stuff as anon
<Sebiale> If I worked the time right, the livestream for tomorrow will start at around 5/6 AM
<Sebiale> I won't leave my room all day it seems :)
<Dermathil> KanyeEast, she explicitly says that she don't read fanfics.
<Zephirdd> AM?
<Zephirdd> lol
<Zephirdd> where do you live
<Zephirdd> wth
<Sebiale> AM
<Sebiale> Minnesota

<FreezeFrame> er, EDT
<Zephirdd> tomorrow the stream starts 7pm EDT

<Sebiale> Well, that's even worse, now I won't sleep at all.
<Sebiale> Hate Stardust!
<Sebiale> No matter what awesome rewards it gives
<Slowter> Night everlasting
<Sebiale> I hates those things.
<mib_5vdrhi> Hey guys, just for clarification: These guys ARE going to be streaming the season premiere on Saturday, right? Live?
<Nari> mfw people keep asking as if we're streaming today
<Sebiale> Well, the stream begins on friday, but it runs till the premier on Staurday.
<Slowter> Bronys are just excited
<Sebiale> As I understand it.
<mib_5vdrhi> So yes, then?
<Zephirdd> yes Sebiale
<Nari> Sebiale: This is correct.
<Sumica> oh look poisen guard...where was that 20 min ago.
<Sebiale> lol
<Zephirdd> so we begin watching Blade Runner at 7pm EDT
<Sebiale> Some items are not conveniently placed.
<Sebiale> Like Kongol's Dragoon Stone
<Zephirdd> and then go for MLP The Movie (1986)
<mib_5vdrhi> Not trying to step on any hooves, here, just wanna make sure I have my info right. I told my friends about it and want to make sure I hadn't informed then incorrectly.
<Sebiale> Who would ever voluntarily go back so far to find it?
<Slowter> Well nice chatting, got to get back to work
<Zephirdd> and then we go for the MLP:FiM marathon all night
<Zephirdd> which will end around the premiere for the season 2
<Sebiale> Is the MLP movie any good?
<Zephirdd> which we will watch live
<Zephirdd> probably not
<Sebiale> lol
<Zephirdd> but that's the point
<Zephirdd> :P
<Zephirdd> it's the 'B' movie
<mib_5vdrhi> Alright, so 6:00am PST, then, right?
<Sebiale> I want to get back to work on my MLP monument tower, but the MC server is being troublesome. :(
<Zephirdd> mib_5vdrhi: for season 2 premiere, yes
<MeteorVenture> lol gotta love whoever wanted that B movie
<LordCelestia> oops
<LordCelestia> #bronystate_d&p

<Zephirdd> Bjorn did it MeteorVenture
<Zephirdd> and he did it to troll us all
<Zephirdd> :P
<MeteorVenture> i look forward to watching it actually
<FreezeFrame> MeteorVenture: Bjornfot picked it
<BakedMacintosh> It could be interesting, don't know...
<FreezeFrame> And he got a flood of congratulatory PMs, because the channel was still in +m for the lottery
<mib_5vdrhi> Thanks, Zephirdd
<MeteorVenture> with a room full of bornies it's gonna be interesting at least
<MeteorVenture> bronies* lol
<FreezeFrame> I'm gonna watch it
<Ghosties> 4Don't forget, I also commended Bjornfot during +m

<Dermathil> haven't seen him in a while now
<NewDCD> 9that's how it's advertised, ja?
<Nari> Hey NewDCD
<Nari> Whatever happened to OldDCD?
<Sumica> he passed away
<NewDCD> 9I would have sampled the stream for you so you could see teh quality, but
<MeteorVenture> i watched that G1 "midnight castle" thing and it was pretty decent when you get past a few things
<Nari> :C
<Cranberry_Scotch> And what does DCD stand for?
<Sumica> cause you know old ans such
<Razyn> Decade
<NewDCD> 9i get asked those questions a lot LOL

<NewDCD> 9oh
<NewDCD> 9wait
<NewDCD> 9nevermind
<Sebiale> OMG, I love these cutscenes.
<NewDCD> 9someone is streaming
<MeteorVenture> the balloon version would be i wanna be inflated
<Sebiale> Their CGI cutscenes are amazingly good for how old they are.
<Razyn> 0Please tell me the stream isn't skippy for just me
<Sumica> Which is why i asked if you needed me to clear out DCD.
<NewDCD> 9nah Sumica it's fine
<Sebiale> It's just you Razyn :(
<NewDCD> 9I'll stream a bit later
<Razyn> 0nononononono This is bad.
<NewDCD> 9also that's quality as expected of one of my faithful students
<herospirit> It is for me, but it always is for me
<Razyn> 0This is definitely bad
<Sumica> =p
<herospirit> Oh. OH
<NewDCD> 9so what game is it?
<herospirit> The music is coming up
<herospirit> Legend of Dragoon
<Sebiale> Legend of Dragoon
<herospirit> THE MUSIC IS COMING UP.
<NewDCD> 9ohhhhhhhh~
<NewDCD> 9I've heard about that game
<Sumica> Dear DCD today i learned the perfect pixal meithoed.
<herospirit> GONNA HAPPEN
<Sebiale> Dart's Theme?
<Vergil> God, Panzer Dragoon. THE MEMORIES, Sir.
<Razyn> 0Dragons are cool. Dragoons are alright.
<herospirit> DART'S THEME IS GONNA HAPEN
<Sebiale> Dart's Theme is awesome.
<Vergil> Er, Legend of Dragoon, not Panzer Dragoon.>.>
<Sebiale> I used to just let the game still for long periods of time to listen to it.
<Rarityfan> where are my ponies!?
<herospirit> I did too Sebiale
<Vergil> "Gust of wind dance!" I still remember that being a running joke with my friends.
<herospirit> YYYYYEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Sebiale> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Razyn> 0Meh
<Sumica> they are waitinf for you on fri and sat Rarityfan
<Sebiale> I love how the character's shout out the attacks when you pull them off.
<Sebiale> The more combos, the more awesome it is.
<herospirit> This song is more powerful in person :p
<Sumica> the combos are hard to pull off with the slight delay
<herospirit> A stream doesn't do it justice :p
<Vergil> "Hey guys, let's play dodge ball!" *5 minutes later, hopping around like a spaz* "GUST OF WIND DANCE!"
<Sebiale> Yeah, the longer combos were EVIL.
<Sebiale> But they were so worth it if you could nail them down consitently.
<Sebiale> I'll asmit, I usually just got to the three-combo attacks and just used those
<Vergil> Really wish my hacked PSP still worked so I could play this.D:
<Vergil> That, And parasite eve.
<Sebiale> So many "Volcano!" shouts . . .
<Razyn> 0The weirdest thing happens. I watch for a couple of days, and then if I stop, the following day is skippy. Then it's all good the following days. This is nerve wracking to say the least.
<Sumica> HARRRRRRPOOOOOOON!
<Sebiale> rofl sumica
<Vergil> Speaking of Awesome PS1 RPGs; anyone remember Xenogears?
<Sumica> I have that too
<Sebiale> Heard of it, never played it.
<Sumica> looooong game
<Nari> XENOGEARS
<Nari> Eghhhhhh
<Vergil> GOD I loved that game.
<Sebiale> It's a turn-based JRPG right?
<Nari> I got so far on luck
<Vergil> Turn based JRPG that utilized button input combos.
<Nari> I got stuck between a boss and standard enemies, neither of which I could kill
<Sebiale> So a lot like LoD
<Vergil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL-_0Yo4ZMQ
<Vergil> There's a link to some gameplay.
<Vergil> Also, it had giant robots.
<Nightstorm> Hello.
<Vergil> My ONE complaint was that it had what I dub a "BLEEEEEEGH" moment.
<Nyst> Is that that game with the underdressed robot girl?
<Vergil> 2 hours of NOTHING but dialogue and storyline sequences.
<Nyst> That could turn her hands into guns?
<Nari> Nyst: If you mean KOS-MOS, that's Xenosaga. >_>
<Sumica> that is xenosaga
<Vergil> Nyst: That's Xenosaga. I consider Xenosaga the somewhat dumb younger brother of Xenogears.
<Sumica> the 6part game that never was
<Vergil> I loved Xenogears to death. I DEPLORED Xenosaga.
<Sebiale> This scene becomes so sad later :(
<Nari> Which I'm terribly biased against, because nobody knows Xenogears and refers to it as inferior against Xenosaga >_>
<Sumica> xenosaga did make for a nice anime though
<NewDCD> 9in other news
<Nightstorm> <.<
<Sebiale> (in retrospect that is)
<NewDCD> 9Xenoblade is grandiose
<Nyst> Well both have Xeno in them >.<
<Nari> 'sup DCD
<NewDCD> 9and KOS-MOS is pretty awesome in SRW OG Saga
<Sumica> they are the same univers Nyst
<Nyst> Just how many 'Xeno' games are there?
<Vergil> Yeah, that's the problem with Xenosaga.
<Vergil> It should have been an anime, not a game.
<Sumica> it was both Vergil
<Vergil> Yeah, I know.
<Vergil> But the games might as well have just been movies.
<Nyst> -gears -saga -blade, etc; all the same universe?
<Sumica> true
<Vergil> They had MGS4 syndrome.
<Sumica> yeah Nyst
<Vergil> Fight a battle, 30 minute cutscene. 2 battles, 25 more minutes of cutscene.
<Vergil> Etc. Etc.
<Nari> Yeah.
<TrollightSparkle> Hey everypony
<Nari> It was MGS4 before MGS4.
<Nari> Hiya Trollight!
<Sumica> Hi TrollightSparkle
<Nyst> Aren't most jrpg's just long linear stories with battles interspersed?
<Vergil> Granted, Xenogears did that too. But at least it was limited to the beginning of disc 2.
<NewDCD> 9Xenoblade is the best Xeno game so far
<NewDCD> 9at least according to the gaming press
<Vergil> Yeah, but the linear stories don't happen in huge chunks between sparse battles.
<Nyst> I mean, cut out the combat and you have a movie.
<Sumica> having never played it I disagree =p
<NewDCD> 9I'm inclined to agree: even while story-heavy, it is much more of a game than the previous attempts
<NewDCD> 9there's also the fact it could as well be called wRPG: The jRPG
<Vergil> I don't think I've seen xenoblade yet. kinda lost interest after the Saga games.
<ctrlx> :| spilt alcohol on my keyboard last night so now i have to use an oldschool white one
<NewDCD> 9Xenoblade is for the Wii, and it's great
<Vergil> Kinda reminds me of the SaGa series (ie: Romancing Saga).
<NewDCD> 9pretty much one of the few reasons to own the bloody thing
<Vergil> Got the first game right, failed over and over again trying to reproduce the magic.
<Nyst> Don't get me wrong, I love the story and worldbuilding; but to me it's less then a game if you can't make a decision that changes the way the story unfolds.
<NewDCD> 9TOO BAD THAT REGGIE IS AN IMBECILE AND WON'T BRING IT STATESIDE, RIGHT GUYS?
<Nari> Sucks, ctrlx :C
<NewDCD> 9seriously, fuck Reggie. He's an idiot.
<ctrlx> NewDCD, is there a way that i can record the stream of s2 using vlc?
<Vergil> Reggie?
<NewDCD> 9>Nintedo of America claims they will consider bringing Xenoblade to America if it sells well in Europe
<TrollightSparkle> Hey ctrlx, you mean the PS/2 keyboards?!
<ctrlx> Nari, i just have to let it dry out for a few days but white one's aren't too bad.
<Nyst> What kind of weird logic is that?
<ctrlx> TrollightSparkle, yep
<ctrlx> i'm lucky my mobo has a port for it
<TrollightSparkle> Aww snap, nostalgiagasm :P
<NewDCD> 9>They expect it to flunk miserably BECAUSE NOT WAGGLAN
<Razyn> 0Wagglan?
<NewDCD> 9>It actually gets SOLD OUT alllllllllllllll across Europe on the first 48 hours
<NewDCD> 9>Nintendo of America goes silent
<PinkieshydashSparkle> HI!
<ctrlx> PinkieshydashSparkle, you forrgot the applejack
<NewDCD> 9ladies and gentlemen, NoA. The greatest money haters this side of the globe
<Vergil> .....Oh yes.
<Nari> ^le sigh
<PinkieshydashSparkle> no, it just wouldn't fit...
<Vergil> Let's not discuss Mother 3.
<Sumica> That's not town it's .......
<NewDCD> 9shiest......seriously, Nintendo of America is fucktarded
<Vergil> *coughcough*
<PinkieshydashSparkle> I typed in "pinkyshydashsparklejackity"
<NewDCD> 9I blame Reggie
<MeteorVenture> well guys i gtg for now
<NewDCD> 9>THIS GAME, "DISASTER DAY OF CRISIS" IS NOT UP TO OUR QUALITY STANDARDS IN NINTENDO OF AMERICA...I MEAN LOOK AT THAT VOICE ACTING (which was actually GOOD, btw)
<MeteorVenture> but we shall meet again
<NewDCD> 9>NEXT UP IN OUR SCHEDULE, RELEASING MORE SHITTY WAGGLAN SHOVELWARE
<NewDCD> 9I played Disaster
<NewDCD> 9one of the few games for the Wii I enjoyed
<Vergil> Even better. Several companies wanted to localize Mother 3. But Nintendo refused to give them the rights.
<Vergil> So not only are they too stingy to release Mother 3 themselves, they also refuse to let anyone else.
<mib_xsu9ob> IS THAT LEGEND OF DRAGOON?
<Vergil> It's like they're holding it HOSTAGE.:/
<Sumica> yep
<ponYthink> Umm... I don't mean to intrude on whatever this is, but will bronystate be able to handle the Traffic for season 2, because it seems to be having a little bit of trouble now and there's only 61 people here.
<KanyeEast> nintendo doesn't seem to think anything not MARIO/ZELDA will ever do well
<PinkieshydashSparkle> just to be clear, the premiere is being streamed here on Saturday, right?
<mib_xsu9ob> I loved that game until my disc decided to stop working. I check PSN for it constantly.
<NewDCD> 9there are no problems on this end ponYthink
<NewDCD> 9.....maybe it's your internet connection
<NewDCD> 9well, if that's the case, you can watch our low-quality stream
<NewDCD> 9and PinkieshydashSparkle: DAT DA PLAN
<ctrlx> NewDCD, is the flash player the only way to watch hte stream?
<Vergil> Zelda? Oh, right. You mean the 'series' that is basically re-releases of Ocarina of time over and over.
<ponYthink> Well, I hope that the stream will be able to handle the number of people, anyways.
<NewDCD> 9ctrlx: if you have an Android mobile phone, Windows Phone, or iPhone you can watch the LQ stream via the uStream app
<MeteorVenture> ocarina of time is best time
<NewDCD> 9theoretically it should handle unlimited viewers
<ctrlx> NewDCD, i'm looking to record it using vlc on my server so that i can have a couple friends watch it off there since they're going to miss the live stream. i tried loading up the source url last night in it but vlc doesn't like rtmp.
<ponYthink> Ok, well thank you for answering my questions! And somewhat alleviating some of my fears. /)^3^(\
<Nyst> Gilda the midwife? What an idea..
<NewDCD> 9ctrlx: you could record the video player itself
<NewDCD> 9Dman would know about that, he tended to do that a lot back when we were running Veemi
<ctrlx> NewDCD, my server is command line only :/
<nate> hey everypony, what's up and what are we watching? :D
<NewDCD> 9ah
<NewDCD> 9well
<NewDCD> 9we will be recording the episode I believe
<NewDCD> 9so uh
<ctrlx> yah. might need to find a different stream or find a prog to work
<TrollightSparkle> Hello nate, and uh, gameplay of some game I don't know of :P
<NewDCD> 9you could grab the file from there
<ctrlx> NewDCD, where'll it be hosted?
<nate> good times :)
<Vergil> It's Legend of Dragoon.
<ctrlx> that actually sounds like a better idea
<Nari> Huh.
<NewDCD> 9no clue yet. Probably Megaupload.
<Sebiale> Back
<Sebiale> OMG, epic scene coming up.
<ctrlx> NewDCD, cool beans
<Sebiale> Wait, now I'm confused. Is season 1 airing at 7 Pm EST, or Blade Runner?
<ctrlx> both
<ctrlx> at the same time
<ctrlx> nah idk
<Sebiale> Neat trick.
<TrollightSparkle> So..
<TrollightSparkle> A stream within a stream?
<TrollightSparkle> :D
<ctrlx> i heard you like streams
<NewDCD> 9don't go Streamception on me
<Sebiale> Well that soldier didn't take much convincing . . .
<NewDCD> 9that's already happened here
<NewDCD> 9and ironically it happened with Inception
<TrollightSparkle> Wow, seriously?
<NewDCD> 9I had to stream a stream of Inception
<ReticentSmolder> SILVERMANE!
<Sebiale> Sandora >>>>>>>> Basil
<Vergil> Yo dawg, I herd u liek streams?
<NewDCD> 9cause my download fucked up
<Sumica> this boss hax
<Sebiale> The illusions suck -_-
<Nari> Good luck :<
<TrollightSparkle> This game looks interesting.
<Sebiale> So is the pre-show essentially just playing requests for five hours tomorrow?
<Jen> Hey everypony!
<TrollightSparkle> Hi Jen
<SilverMane> ?
<DecapKnight> Ohai Silvermane
<Jen> What're we watching, currently?
<Sebiale> Legend of Dragoon
<DecapKnight> fighting
<Vergil> Legend of Dragoon.
<Sebiale> I like a Dart/Rose/Kongol setup. Dart is average, Rose is weak against physical and Kongol is weak against magic.
<Nyst> SPINNING CANE! VOLCANO!
<SilverMane> whatcha need ReticentSmolder?
<Sumica> HARRRRRRPOOOOOOOON!
<Vergil> GUST OF WIND-DANCE!
<Sebiale> Blossom Storm!
<Sumica> feh another boss
<Sebiale> BLAZING DYNAMO!!!
<ReticentSmolder> y u no chat SilverMane?
*GrimGallop appears
<Nyst> How would that even work today? Shouting 'TRIGGERPULL BULLETSHOOT'?
<GrimGallop> Is this Legend of Dragoon?
<Sumica> yea
<Shutterfly> 11yep
<GrimGallop> This is totally Legend of Dragoon.
<Sebiale> Blazing Dynamo is the name for Dart's highest addition. It's just a bunch of sword strikes.
<GrimGallop> :D
<Vergil> Nah. Due to the popularity of anime nowadaze, it'd be all in Japanese, Nyst.
<Sumica> oh right cant fail combos on this one
<Nyst> Ah yeah; or some faux-latin sounding stuff
<Sebiale> Dead
<Sebiale> Curses
<GrimGallop> lol
<Sebiale> Tougher than I thought they were.
<GrimGallop> You seem disappointed
<Nari> Hiya Grim!
<GrimGallop> Ahoy!
<Sebiale> Lavitz dead
<Buckshot> howdy
<GrimGallop> D&P going on? I went to see a movie and just got back :O
<Sebiale> D&P?
<Nari> We're doing... stuff.
<Nyst> The damage of attacks is directly related to how cool they look.
<Nari> #bronystate_d&p
<Sebiale> Hardest additions in the games for me were the Dragoon physical attacks.
<Sebiale> I hate that little eyeball charger.
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Kongol smash
<Sumica> no dynamic kill for you Dart.
<Nyst> Let's have a think here
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> And this is where the game gets difficult
<Nari> I found a ringpop and some taffy :3
<Nyst> If there was a pony JRPG, how would you handle combat so it was kidfriendly/safe (so no violence), yet still challenging gameplay wise?
<Sumica> finaly
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> This is indeed where the game started kicking my ass the first time I played
<Vergil> What IS D&P?
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Nyst, what would have to change in the gameplay to make it kid friendly?
<Vergil> D:
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> OH CRAP BRING THE WEAPONS BACK
<TrollightSparkle> Vergil, last I remembered, it's an impromptu game of D&D.. I think :P
<Nyst> Well basically it can't have blood, death etc.
<Nyst> You don't even have those in boy cartoons
<Vergil> Fighting is Magic is doing a fairly good job I think, when it comes to those standards.
<Nyst> mmyeah
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Dem counters
<Nyst> though there's no way that game would exist anywhere else then here.
<TrollightSparkle> On a side note, this boss fight looks so.. unfair
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> He counters you if you mess up your combo
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> You have to get the timing right.
<Nyst> look at kid cartoons these days. Very often there are no weapons, just fighting via proxy; with the hero always being the defencer/the one to prove himself.
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Or else.
<Sumica> and thus a plot device was discovered.
<Vergil> If THIS is considered a 'hard boss fight' I shudder to think what you'd think of a Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne boss fight.
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> No, it's just where the game gets somewhat challenging Vergil
<Jimmy_Bravebottom> Is the stream fucked for everyone else?
<Nyst> hmm, okay I have it some thought, and a pony game could work where there is literally no physical contact
<Nittany_Tiger_> Damn. Dead island is cruel. I went to start the game, and went to get something to eat while the game was loading.
<mib_ihuk3h> omg this game? i still have it!
<Vergil> SMT is highly regarded for its soul crushing difficulty.
<Nyst> Dash could just spin you dizzy, AJ could buck a tree and drop apples on your head, things like that
<FreezeFrame> Dat unlock boss fight.
<Nyst> Ooh big scene coming up
<Nari> HAHA, SMT BOSS FIGHTS
<Nittany_Tiger_> Game plops me into a zombie horde before I get back to my PC.
<mib_ihuk3h> 4 discs of awesome
<Sebiale> So how does SMT compare to Demons Souls?
<Wrek> 05old games always makes me happy isnide
<TrollightSparkle> No kill like overkill.
<Vergil> Two different games, Seb.
<Sebiale> In terms of difficulty.
<FreezeFrame> Imagine if they did a rerelease of this with updated graphics
<Vergil> I'd say it's on par.
<Sumica> FFFFFFFFFFFu game let me save already
<Sebiale> I drool over thoughts like that DreezeFrame
<Nari> Vergil, how about Etrian Odyssey?
<mib_ihuk3h> they need to rereleas this on bluray
<Vergil> Often times just to clear a boss you need to go do a bunch of fusions to get a monster, then level it up enough to fight the boss....
<NewDCD> 9Dart transformed into Spike
<Sebiale> Dart is cooler than Spike
<Vergil> Just so at least ONE member of your party can survive the inevitable 'instakill all' spell the boss uses.
<mib_ihuk3h> this makes me want to go and continue where i left off, on disc 3
<Nyst> Who is the chick with only one sock?
<Sebiale> Rose
<Vergil> Etrian is NOTHING compared to SMT.
<Vergil> That much I can say for certain. I was on the QA team for Etrian.
<Sebiale> She's over 10K years old.
<mib_ihuk3h> it pissed me off when Lavitz died
<Sebiale> Meh, I prefer Albert over Lavitz.
<TrollightSparkle> Damnit, could you at least give out a spoiler alert..?
<mib_ihuk3h> well albert just seemed like a noob, where lavitz gave that pro feel
<TrollightSparkle> >_>
<TrollightSparkle> Nah, it's cool.. but I really was considering searching for this game..
<mib_ihuk3h> lol spoiler of a game thats older than god knows what
<Nyst> Predestination stuff. Staple of rpg's
<Vergil> Snape kills dumbledore!
<Vergil> D:
<mib_ihuk3h> i have this game
<TrollightSparkle> FFFFFFFFFF
<mib_ihuk3h> who wants to buy it from me
<TrollightSparkle> Too bad I've already read the books! :D
<Vergil> Vader is Luke's father!
<SuperBrony64> Howdy everypony!
<mib_ihuk3h> got to dig this out of my closet and play it someday
<TrollightSparkle> Why hai there
<Vergil> Soylent Green is People!
<Sumica> You still around DCD?
<SuperBrony64> Wow, thanks for spoiling it for me >:(
<mib_ihuk3h> Han shoots first
<Vergil> Any others I missed?
<TrollightSparkle> SuperBrony64!
<SuperBrony64> TrollightSparkle!
<Sumica> Peater Parker is Spiderman!
*Dermathil wishes a big welcome to all the newcomers
*TrollightSparkle brohoofus maximus
<Vergil> Someone NEEDS to do that fan picture.
<mib_ihuk3h> Peter Parker's uncle died
<sgtm14> hi everybody
<Vergil> Rainbow Dash, Dressed as Charlton Heston.
<mib_ihuk3h> NO
<mib_ihuk3h> ITS EVERYPONY GOD DAMIT
<SuperBrony64> mib_ihuk3h: LALALA NOT LISTENING
<TrollightSparkle> So many people joining.. I'm just gonna say hi to all the people that are joining.
<Vergil> Yelling "The cupcakes are made out of PONIES! IT'S POOOOONNIEES!"
<FreezeFrame> Spoiler for Passion: Jesus gets crucified!
<mib_ihuk3h> NOT FUCKING "EVERYBODY" ITS EVERYPONY GOD DAMIT *Ghost rage, beer cans flying everywhere*
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…is there anything special about Thursday night? Seems like a lot of people are on right now...
<Wilkin> 13­
<Shutterfly> 0equestria daily just did a plug for bronystate
<TrollightSparkle> Dunno
<Vergil> I cannot bring myself to use the term everyp
<TrollightSparkle> Did they really?
<mib_ihuk3h> idk, but did you ponies see the interview with lauren faust on EqD?
<Vergil> See? My English Gland stopped me.
<Shutterfly> 0yeah, i saw it
<Shutterfly> 0why is mine yellow
<TrollightSparkle> Didn't, cause I don't check EqD that often.
<Shutterfly> 0i just came here for the first time
<SuperBrony64> I see...
<Wilkin> ­
<mib_ihuk3h> check it now dude
<Wilkin> ­
<Wilkin> ­
<Vergil> I have this gland in my brain that inflates whenever someone does something terrible to the English language.
<Dark_Heart> hi shutterfly
<SuperBrony64> Is it just me or is Wilkin not saying anything?
<Vergil> If it gets too big, it'll explode and I'll die.
<NewDCD> 9gonna take over for a little while
<Shutterfly> 0is it yellow to indicate text you've personally entered?
<Vergil> So I can't use the term everyp
<Wilkin> Yes, I am pretty shy-
<mib_ihuk3h> Get a English Glandectomy, duh.
<Wilkin> ­
<Sumica> DCD is gonna take over for a few. give my arm a break.
<Vergil> I tried to play Borderlands the other day.
<mib_ihuk3h> then you can say all the fun brony terms without a problem
<Vergil> After about the 15th 'Pis off' sign, I passed out.
<TrollightSparkle> Vergil, Borderlands is hilarious
<SuperBrony64> *sigh* I think I failed my Organic Chemistry quiz :/
<TrollightSparkle> Least, I think so ;_;
<Vergil> This is why I would not survive post-apocolypse.
<Shutterfly> 0its a good game
<Nari> Borderlands is amazing. :D
<mib_ihuk3h> ok bye everypony!
<Shutterfly> 0cya
<Nari> Bye!
<TrollightSparkle> Bye mib'
<Dark_Heart> cio
<TrollightSparkle> Bye anon.. or mib.. or.. I dunno ;_;
<Vergil> Not because I have no survival skills, but because the blatant misspellings everywhere would kill me.
<Shutterfly> 0is the stream over or is my internet derping?
<Vergil> Later days, mib!
<Vergil> It's over for the moment, I think./
<Shutterfly> 0alright
<Vergil> I think they may be switching.
<Vergil> Not sure.
<SuperBrony64> From Equestria Daily "BronyState is having a movie night tomorrow in honor of season two…" Do they really not know anything about BronyState?
<TrollightSparkle> *shrug*
<Sumica> NewDCD, has somthing to show you all.
<Shutterfly> 0I think bronystate is a pretty cool guy, eh shows season 2 online and doesn't afraid of anything
<Dark_Heart> YAY SEASON TWO!!! i think i'm going to have a heart attack
<Vergil> UGH. G1 pony movie.

<Sebiale> Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World are awesome jrpg parodies.
<Vergil> I'm SCARED, sarge!
<TrollightSparkle> No wai. We're actually watching G1 tomorrow?
<Sumica> G1 movie yes
<Vergil> A Movie is Bladerunner.
<TrollightSparkle> The bunkers. Head to them. NOW
<Sumica> it's the B movie
<SuperBrony64> TrollightSparkle: Yeah, My Little Pony The Movie from the 80s
<Vergil> The B-movie is "My Little Pony: The Movie".
<TrollightSparkle> :D
<Shutterfly> 0 80s XD
<Sumica> A movie is blade runner
<TrollightSparkle> 80's explains it all to me XD
<Vergil> I'm gonna need a LOT more alcohol....
<Shutterfly> 0blade runner is a movie

<Razyn> 0Is DCD streaming now?
<TrollightSparkle> Better yet, DOS
<Dark_Heart> try refreshing
<Sumica> ah there we go
<CuddlySatan> Minix!
<Sumica> 95, i want to watch it crash
<Nari> WinXP SP-3 is my votw
<CuddlySatan> FreeBSD!
<Nari> vote
<Shutterfly> 0shield boomerang? what
<Dark_Heart> and Celestia said " Let there be giant mechs."
<ctrlx> win7
<TrollightSparkle> SUDDENLY SPANISH
<Shutterfly> 0wait is that spanish wikipedia about math
<Sumica> MATHS!
<Vergil> Wait, I just had to AFK. What is this again?
<Nari> HAHAHA
<SuperBrony64> Mediana?
<Shutterfly> 0suddenly math, thousands of them
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubuntu!
<NewDCD> 9sorry, I might have to minimize sometimes without previous notice
<Dark_Heart> someone forgot to do their homework
<NewDCD> 9due to personal reasons
<Shutterfly> 0alright
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9uhhh
<NewDCD> 9guess I'll use XP Service Pack 3
<NewDCD> 9because I like bigass swords for our test pilot
<TrollightSparkle> I think we can all agree on Windows 95 :P
<CuddlySatan> no, use FreeBSD
<Shutterfly> 0how is this game even possible
<SuperBrony64> I didn't know Snails was a pilot...
<Nari> LETS ROCK
<Sebiale> Should I try to play Half-Life before Half-Life 2? (tried it before but I can't get the long jump to work.)
<CuddlySatan> the same way MUGEN is possible
<Vergil> Oh. It turns Operating Systems into Mecha?
<TrollightSparkle> Alright, this looks badass. How do I get it?
<Sumica> it's a Gundam!
<Dark_Heart> OH NO, IT'S SNAIL!!!! RUN FOR THE HILLS EVERYPONY!!!!!!
<CuddlySatan> Try a Somersault!
<Pontang> Dynasty Warriors? :o
<Vergil> In B4 Windows 98 SE is a cardboard box with a tin can glued on.
<CuddlySatan> Use the boost to chase!
<SuperBrony64> Use Bombs wisely!
<Shutterfly> 0do a barrel roll
<Sumica> ARRRRRRRwing
<Dark_Heart> Do a barrel roll
<CuddlySatan> Slippy, get back here!
<Shutterfly> 0go i actually played the game those are from
<Shutterfly> 0last weekend
<Shutterfly> 0my friend still has his 64 and starfox
<Shutterfly> 0and pokemon stadium XD
<Sumica> oh hi invisable walls
<SuperBrony64> So…this is My Little Pony?!
<CuddlySatan> I can't let you do that, Star Fox
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Dark_Heart> Snails vs Snails. It's the end of the word as we know it
<Sumica> MLP: Mechs are awsome
<SuperBrony64> They certainly have changed it since G3.5
<Shutterfly> 0Mechs are magic
<CuddlySatan> Alright, we're heading to Aquas-tria
<Dark_Heart> who needs magic when you have a gaint mech
<Shutterfly> 0My little Gundam: laser swords are magic
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy's ship is in the docking bay.
<Dark_Heart> lol
<CuddlySatan> Cthulu Tech players do
<Sumica> needs more macross missle mayhem
<Pontang> Dark_Heart: or you could have Ideon.
<Pontang> =x
<SuperBrony64> Maintenance on Rainbow Dash's ship is complete.
<Shutterfly> 0is there a way to set afk?
<Pontang> Ultimate power + Mecha = destroy EVERY THING!
<Shutterfly> 0and are the chatnames remembered?
<CuddlySatan> Location confirmed, sending supplies
<SuperBrony64> "/away"?
<Sumica> idle for 10 min
<Shutterfly> 0ok cool
<Shutterfly> 0god ive played minecraft online
<Shutterfly> 0i probably should have tried that
<Dark_Heart> lauch the cutie mark crusaders
<Sumica> Fire the chickengun
<CuddlySatan> You must construct additional pylons
<Dark_Heart> UNLEASH NIGHTMARE
<Pontang> Why u no ZZ Gundam?
<Nari> This makes me wanna armored core
<CuddlySatan> Armored core is like this?
<Sumica> the hell was taht a nonoha spell?
<CuddlySatan> Believe it
<Dark_Heart> I don't believe
<Sumica> Was thinking of puting AC2 on after dcd is done.
<Shutterfly> 0additional supply depots are needed
<CuddlySatan> More lumber is required
<Shutterfly> 0wololo
<Nari> Armored Core is more realistic. This is an awesome robot battle
<CuddlySatan> This reminds me of Tenkaichi
<Nari> Giant laser swords and fast dashing and whatnot.
<CuddlySatan> The perspective, anyway
<Dark_Heart> I learned a new way to say hi *slashs with sword* HI
<Sumica> it's a PINCHA!
<Pontang> Well, technically Gundam = first real robot series
<Shutterfly> 0so are these just streams of emulators?
<CuddlySatan> That's pretty questionable
<Shutterfly> 0for this at least
<Razyn> 0mfw, the red thing looks like a pony
<Vergil> I can't find any Nueue Ziel downloads for Bootfighter.:<
<Vergil> Disappoint.
<CuddlySatan> Considering that the first Mobile Suit Gundam was in space
<CuddlySatan> This is more like G Gundam
<Dark_Heart> Send in the Crisis suit team
<CuddlySatan> Also, the environments need work
<Dark_Heart> For the Tau
<Sumica> in 2021 the OS wars began.
<Shutterfly> 0wait why won't the high quality stream work
<Pontang> Actually, SEED was an attempt at a reboot of the original Gundam series.
<Shutterfly> 0and if you want a bad game environment, play superman 64
<mib_ppq0g9> when will season 2 start? iam on the pacific coast of canada so the time change is confusing
<CuddlySatan> OH GOD WHY DID YOU MENTION THAT?
<Dark_Heart> hey, another canadian
<Pontang> But not all of Mobile Suit Gundam was in outerspace.
<Sumica> every one loves SEED
<Pontang> Sumica: no
<Pontang> No
<SuperBrony64> Season 2 starts at 6 AM PST
<Pontang> No
<CuddlySatan> No
<Shutterfly> 0so wait how is the live stream working
<Dark_Heart> ya
<CuddlySatan> Who knows
<SuperBrony64> Shutterfly: You mean right now?
<Shutterfly> 0no
<Sumica> oh right you are new with us Pontang. it's a bit of a running joke.
<Shutterfly> 0i think its working via internet right now
<Shutterfly> 0i mean chronologically
<Shutterfly> 0tomorrow
<Pontang> Around 15 episodes of MSG took place on Earth.
<Shutterfly> 0PST for me
<Pontang> Sumica: =3
<Sumica> windows black is kicking arse
<Shutterfly> 0is there a windows ME?
<mib_ppq0g9> thanks
<SuperBrony64> Right after the movies end, there will be a Season 1 marathon which one of the streamers will stream from their computer.
<mib_ppq0g9> OH YES I LIKE THE SOUDN OF THAT!
<NewDCD> 9that was Bootfighter Windom
<NewDCD> 9it's a free game
<SuperBrony64> After that, the stream will switch to someone with a capture card on their computer and play The Hub live.
<Sumica> nice game DCD
<NewDCD> 9you can get it from here
<Shutterfly> 0okay cool
<Revolver> who's streaming?
<mib_ppq0g9> anyone read the fallout equestria fanfic?
<Nari> dat desktop
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: Looks cool, but I'm sure it doesn't run on Mac :/
<mib_sf4yw0> why is hub no streaming D:
<NewDCD> 9http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7XQ6T32Z
<Shutterfly> 0also i have the vague feeling that's questionably legal
<NewDCD> 9beecause
<NewDCD> 9copyright bullshit
<Revolver> DCD you streaming
<Shutterfly> 0is okay with this
<NewDCD> 9so we won't stream the Hub till it's time to stream the Hub
<SuperBrony64> Because then that would be logical and they would lose viewers on TV.
<NewDCD> 9aka: the pony episodes
<Shutterfly> 0no i mean
<NewDCD> 9anyways gonna switch to SRW
<Shutterfly> 0lol i just meant streaming it at all
<Dark_Heart> PONY VIDEOS :)
<Shutterfly> 0seemed questionable
<Sumica> unless you wantto watch happy days cause that's what is on hub right now.
<Shutterfly> 0not that its any of my concern
<SuperBrony64> TV studios only know of who's watching based on how many people are watching their channel on TV.
<Revolver> NewDCD where did you get SRW from?
<Shutterfly> 0i wonder if
<Shutterfly> 0dvr'ing a show
<Shutterfly> 0still counts as a view
<Shutterfly> 0because in order to dvr it
<mib_ppq0g9> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNgg_8wfbF0&list=FL886Wj90ltvsyzkPhGylHqQ&feature=plpp
<mib_ppq0g9> epic pony pmv
<NewDCD> 9Revolver: I patched SRW J myself
<Shutterfly> 0it need stream the cable information
<SuperBrony64> Shutterfly, It does because the box has to tune it to the channel in order to watch it.
<Shutterfly> 0it probably still counts
<Shutterfly> 0yeah exactly
<Sumica> it's ok Shutterfly I am part of a nealsion family I count as 500k people when i watch a show.
<SuperBrony64> But I don't have a cable box (nor cable :P), so I'm just going to get it as a Season pass on iTunes.
<Shutterfly> 0how do you directly address a person, as in the bolded coloring
<Shutterfly> 0is it
<Shutterfly> 0@ or #?
<Shutterfly> 0oh
<SuperBrony64> By just typing their name.
<Shutterfly> 0oh okay
<Sumica> type a bit of the name then hit tab Shutterfly
<SuperBrony64> See, Shutterfly
<Shutterfly> 0what does the hash tag do?
<Shutterfly> 0i was wondering how you were typing such a counterintuative name so efficiently
<SuperBrony64> Oh wow, did not know the tab shortcut :P
<Sumica> ^_^
<NewDCD> 9we're live again
<SuperBrony64> Hurray for being Live!
<mib_ppq0g9> Ban-presto? lol
<Shutterfly> 0this is the most haphazard stream ever
<Shutterfly> 0i like it
<SuperBrony64> Now what are we watching?
<Shutterfly> 0me gusta face
<Sumica> SRW
<SuperBrony64> I see.
<Nari> FUCK YEAH, SPIKE.
<Sumica> Super robot wars
<Shutterfly> 0lol manticore
<mib_sf4yw0> Broadcast is offline
<Sumica> I see you set the attack names.
<NewDCD> 9check out my sweet ride, guys
<Shutterfly> 0whats up with the 'high quality stream popout'?
<Sumica> use http://bronystate.net/theatre/
<Shutterfly> 0it doesnt seem to lad
<SuperBrony64> Broadcast is online, try and refresh the page mib_sf4yw0
<Shutterfly> 0load
<NewDCD> 9Shutterfly: that's our old HQ player. We haven't been able to change it yet
<Shutterfly> 0oh alright
<Shutterfly> 0is the theater thing the same?
<Zmib_cv4lwo> Awwwwww yeaaaaaa
<mib_1j72ku> what am i watching?
<mib_sf4yw0> refreshed twice, broadcast is offline
<Sumica> Super robot wars
<SuperBrony64> Super Robot Wars
<Shutterfly> 0also is this site hosted in canada or something
<Shutterfly> 0cause of the theatre
<Nari> ^lolwhat
<SuperBrony64> You mean based off of the spelling Shutterfly ?
<Shutterfly> 0is the anglican spelling
<Shutterfly> 0yeah
<Shutterfly> 0and the show is animated in canada
<NewDCD> 9actually
<Shutterfly> 0seems logical
<mib_ppq0g9> i never knew there was a dif spelling (derp iam canadian)
<NewDCD> 9Dari is british
<Shutterfly> 0theater
<NewDCD> 9and he's our code junkie
<Shutterfly> 0you mean web design guru?
<Sumica> Dari probably derped when making it =p
<Shutterfly> 0XD
<SuperBrony64> Uh-oh! That means I'm connecting long distance over the internet!
<NewDCD> 9no no, the stream is hosted in another server
<NewDCD> 9so yeah
<Shutterfly> 0uribatake looks like a trollface
<NewDCD> 9Uribatake
<SuperBrony64> Haha :P
<TrollightSparkle> He has the face of an asshole.
<NewDCD> 9Y u want to hit on the CMC?
<Sumica> problem, Shutterfly =p
<SuperBrony64> Someone is hitting on CMC?
<Shutterfly> 0yes, problem, his chin is jutting out of his face for like 5 inches
<TrollightSparkle> ^
<mib_ppq0g9> hes the son of j leno probably
<Shutterfly> 0also another question, is the name remembered via IP or something?
<Shutterfly> 0or you just keep entering it when you come back
<SuperBrony64> Uh-oh, enemy attack!
<SuperBrony64> We need the power of the Mane 6!
<mib_ppq0g9> Some one set up us the bomb
<mib_ppq0g9> we get signal
<Shutterfly> 0lol they just put a weird screen animation over the regular sprites
<Shutterfly> 0main screen turn on
<Sumica> Depends on how you connect Shutterfly
<mib_ppq0g9> hello gentlecolts
<Shutterfly> 0all your base are belong to us
<SuperBrony64> Hello, how are you gentlemen?
<Seviper> wait, is this super robot wars?
<Sumica> a stand alone irc will keep it in.
<Shutterfly> 0oh god the gentlemen meme has ruined that word for me
<mib_ppq0g9> all your bros are belong to us
<SuperBrony64> All your base are belong to us.
<SuperBrony64> NINJA'D!
<TrollightSparkle> Sucks to be you.
<SuperBrony64> +200 Points
<Shutterfly> 0wait theres a standalone version of then?
<Shutterfly> 0this
<Sumica> Yes Seviper
<Sumica> stand alone chat yes Shutterfly it's just IRC.
<Sumica> the stream requires a site.
<Shutterfly> 0oh yeah i remember now
<Shutterfly> 0internet relay whatever
<mib_ppq0g9> how long until some season 1 marathon?
<SuperBrony64> You can use an IRC client to access this chat. (Windows: mIRC Mac: Colloquy)
<SuperBrony64> Season 1 is after Movie Night
<Shutterfly> 0ugh gtg
<SuperBrony64> Movie night starts at 7 PM EST tomorrow.
<TrollightSparkle> Thought mIRC only had a trial version then you had to pay SuperBrony64?
<Nari> Bye Shutterfly!
<Sumica> but some browsers will remember what you type in to a data field such as login names.
<SuperBrony64> Night Shutterfly.
*Nari hugs Shutterfly goodnight
<TrollightSparkle> Bye Shutterfly!
<Sumica> Dont have to pay but after 30days it has a load time on start up TrollightSparkle
<SuperBrony64> TrollightSparkle, well, even if that's the case, you can still use it as an IRC client no? :P
<TrollightSparkle> This is true..
<mib_ppq0g9> so at about 8 or 9 am tomorrow for me?
<TrollightSparkle> I'm stupid, please ignore me sometimes. :/
<Vergil> So, I never really got into Super Robot wars.
<Wilkin> How does one become a pony?
<SuperBrony64> I'm not familiar as to what the best IRC client is on Windows (been using Macs for the longest time now), but I do recommend Colloquy if you have a Mac.
<Vergil> Is it like, some giant crossover or something?
<Sumica> not stupid, just missinformed.
<Sumica> ....wow i have not used that line sence i stopped GMing for eve.
<TrollightSparkle> Hmm
<SuperBrony64> mib_ppq0g9: Depends where you live.
<SuperBrony64> You not in the United States?
*Wilkin is now a pony.
<TrollightSparkle> Now afk time, I guess.
<mib_ppq0g9> but the marathon is before seaosn 2 ep 1 right?

<mib_ppq0g9> so seaosn 1 marathon not happening tonight or anytime soon?
<SuperBrony64> Well, if you stay up for Marathon, you'll have a good incentive to stay up haha.
<Sumica> might try and run the sunday showing of ep 201 as well
<Sumica> but that's even earlyer >_<
<TrollightSparkle> Well yeah, but I can't really stay up late late anymore.. getting myself adjusted for the beginning of the school year :/
<mib_ppq0g9> so season 1 marathon is tomrrow?
<Sumica> you are around one day to early anon

<awolf> super brobot wars
<TrollightSparkle> But Anon.
<TrollightSparkle> Pull up a chair, join us. http://www.ponychan.net/chan/dis/src/131474126132.png
<SuperBrony64> A lot of people are here because of that notice on Equestria Daily haha
<Shutterfly> stop, collaborate
<Shutterfly> oh yeah and I'm back
<SuperBrony64> Welcome back!
<Shutterfly> ok whoa i have no idea what's going on now
<Sumica> Giant robot mixup
<Flutteryay> So mucgh Pony
<SuperBrony64> Super Robot Wars…but I think you were here when he started it?
<Flutteryay> So much Pony.
<Shutterfly> yeah but
<Shutterfly> only during the unduly long intro
<Shutterfly> not actual fighting
<SuperBrony64> Yeah, this is the start of the game lol
<Vergil> So, wait. Which SRW title is this?
<SuperBrony64> It took awhile for the game to actually start.
<Sumica> she's a brit?
<Shutterfly> lol guv.nah
<NewDCD> 9naw
<NewDCD> 9she's just madmax: Real Robot Pilot Edition
<NewDCD> 9also the game freezes when I type
<NewDCD> 9so don't worry
<Vergil> Anyone know exactly WHICH SRW title this is?
<Shutterfly> probably one of them with SRW in the name
<NewDCD> 9SRW J
<Vergil> There's so many in the wiki, I can't figure which this is.D:
<SuperBrony64> Never actually heard of the game until DCD started playing it haha
<Shutterfly> what platform was this for originally?
<SuperBrony64> I wanna guess either Playstation or Dreamcast...
<SuperBrony64> But could have been originally on PC
<NewDCD> 9series started on the GB
<NewDCD> 9now it's on basically every console except PC
<Sumica> Man I realy want to show some gunbuster now.
<Shutterfly> whoa yeah
<SuperBrony64> This one looks to have been on the GBA
<Shutterfly> i just looked at the wikipedia which has its own article
<Shutterfly> on SRW titles by platform
<awolf> it's spike
<Shutterfly> wait what cellular phone
<SuperBrony64> Cellular Phone?
<Sumica> yes if you count Nokia's talkie taco.
<Shutterfly> there was an srw game
<Shutterfly> for some sort of phone apparently?
<Sumica> the Ngadge
<Sumica> aka the talkie taco
<Shutterfly> okay
<SuperBrony64> Haha, you mean the N-Gage?
<Sumica> yeah
<Razyn> 0So, Sumica, are you planning on recording the season two premiere?
<Shutterfly> wait i just looked it up, wtf is this ngage thing
<Shutterfly> how could they possibly think that was a good idea
<SuperBrony64> That was an interesting device. Pretty much the original cell phone to start marketing hardcore games to a cell phone.
<Trainguyxx> it was some crappy gameing/phone thing
<Trainguyxx> ll
<SuperBrony64> But failed horribly.
<Trainguyxx> very
<Sumica> have tryed to record but would have to use two programs to get a good quality image that is't interlaced.
<Shutterfly> see: gameboy micro
<Trainguyxx> i remember it being in gamestop
<Shutterfly> for failed handhelds
<Flaria> Shutterfly, they had dreams of something like the PSP phone thingy, except they sucked at implementation
<Flaria> Sucked so very hard.
<Sumica> I would rather give you all a better stream for the live and get a rip of it later on.
<Flaria> inb4sexualreference
<SuperBrony64> Problem was 1.) It cost about $300, which was crazy for a portable game system
<Sumica> they are showing ep 201 6 times between saterday and monday.
<Trainguyxx> i dont think anyone would have said "thats what she said"
<Shutterfly> and i agree with Sumica on the stream
<Sumica> so plenty of time to grab it.
<awolf> massive army of bots
<SuperBrony64> 2.) The graphics/games
<SuperBrony64> weren't spectacular enough to draw in any real attention
<Shutterfly> lol big blast
<Shutterfly> *rocket fires from awkward location*
<SuperBrony64> Plus you needed a cell phone plan to use it, which left out the market of young gamers from using it (which was a major audience for portable game systems)
<Sumica> you should see the punch to the moon Shutterfly
<Trainguyxx> hey gall_ could you make up ur mind with ut name
<Jigglysaint> Hi
<SuperBrony64> Howdy Jigglysaint
<Flaria> trainguy, just in case.
<Sumica> use the beam of war on it
<awolf> GRAVITY BLAST FIRE! *:D*
<Shutterfly> seemed like a bit overkill
<Sumica> there is no overkill, only open fire and i have to reload.
<Jigglysaint> So the live stream of season 2 is here then?
<Sumica> yes Jigglysaint
<SuperBrony64> Yes, but not today.
<Jigglysaint> What time is it supposed to be on at?
<Sumica> 6am pst 9am est
<Trainguyxx> i think it was ten?
<Jigglysaint> okay
<Trainguyxx> oh, 9
<SuperBrony64> 6 AM PST, which is right after the Season 1 Marathon, which is right after the Movie Night
<Shutterfly> oh geez 6 Am pst?
<SuperBrony64> Yeah
<Sumica> yeah
<Trainguyxx> man thats going to be hard waking up...I really destroy my interal clock
<Jigglysaint> I'm on EST
<Trainguyxx> and im in est
<Shutterfly> also what that means the movie night
<Shutterfly> is like
<Jigglysaint> still means I have to get up early
<Shutterfly> at 1 AM
<SuperBrony64> Just watch the entire Season 1 Marathon to keep you awake lol
<Shutterfly> that might work
<Jigglysaint> I wish
<awolf> some things are just worth staying up for
<Jigglysaint> well I'll keep the computer on
<Sumica> pray all to Celestia and luna i dont sleep in (like i could even sleep the night before)
<Shutterfly> or waking up for
<Trainguyxx> agree'd
<Jigglysaint> though if I camp out in the stream I might crash firefoxx
<Trainguyxx> why?
<Jigglysaint> it happened once
<Jigglysaint> computer ran out of memory
<Trainguyxx> i was thinking of camping too...
<Shutterfly> chrome is the unstable one
<Trainguyxx> oh is that all?
<NewDCD> 9suddenly
<Trainguyxx> and i use firefox, so i guess im good
<SuperBrony64> How much memory you running?
<NewDCD> 9MANSPIKE ATTACK
<Jigglysaint> no clue
<Trainguyxx> >_>
<SuperBrony64> -_-
<Shutterfly> uh
<Shutterfly> try typing
<Sumica> lol DCD
<Shutterfly> 'system'
<Shutterfly> into the start menu search bar
<awolf> gem romancer
<SuperBrony64> You could right click "My Computer" and click "Properties " to find out.
<Flaria> Hell yes, Gem Romancer
<awolf> i lol'd
<Jigglysaint> well it's an older computer
<Shutterfly> then click system
<awolf> i like how spike uses gems
<Shutterfly> and it will say how much
<Trainguyxx> yeah
<SuperBrony64> Right click "My Computer" then Jigglysaint
<Trainguyxx> it's pretty perfect
<Shutterfly> god dis game
<SuperBrony64> But if it's really eating up memory, just use Chrome. It uses the least amount of memory I believe.
<Shutterfly> lol no it doesn't
<Trainguyxx> i believe he said he was using chrome
<Shutterfly> SuperBrony64: it uses the least for say 1 tab
<SuperBrony64> What uses the least amount of memory then?
<Shutterfly> but it threads
<Shutterfly> *each* tab
<Trainguyxx> hell i cant even tell anymore
<NewDCD> 9oh hey
<Trainguyxx> hexacores and 8 gigs of memory does that to you
<NewDCD> 9Spike learned Combo L1
<Trainguyxx> lol
<Shutterfly> lol i have 4 gigs ddr3 its not a problem for me
<Jigglysaint> well it says the virtual memory is about 720 megs
<Jigglysaint> like I said, old computer
<Shutterfly> except when exceeding like 100 chrome tabs
<Trainguyxx> lol
<Sumica> Same here Shutterfly
<Flaria> Hot damn.
<Trainguyxx> i havent tried 100 tabs yet
<Sumica> But I use FF
<Shutterfly> well thats your GPU memory Jigglysaint
<Trainguyxx> but the kmost ive done was pretty big,a nd it was fine, even reloading all of them at once
<Shutterfly> aka graphics card
<Jigglysaint> ah
<Shutterfly> but with
<awolf> TEAMWORK
<Shutterfly> that much gpu memory
<Shutterfly> it could be only maybe 3 years old
<SuperBrony64> If you just right click "My Computer" and click "Properties" it will show up underneath the computer info
<Shutterfly> or just my computer
<SuperBrony64> That's actually just the virtual memory that the computer allocates.
<Shutterfly> it should be on the bottom bar
<Shutterfly> oh wait
<Trainguyxx> of course, the best way to remember ur computer stats is to put the memory and hardware in urself
<Shutterfly> did he say
<Shutterfly> crap
<awolfers> i accidentally my browser
<Trainguyxx> i can resite my specs by heart
<Shutterfly> lol so can I
<Jigglysaint> well anyway, I can try camping out
<Shutterfly> im using a laptop though
<awolf> there we go
<Sumica> the whole thing awolfers?
<Jigglysaint> mind you I won't be able to sleep anyway
<Trainguyxx> huge ass tower for me =D my favorite
<Shutterfly> and modding a laptop is a pain
<Trainguyxx> yeah
<Shutterfly> compared to a desktop
<Trainguyxx> too much of a pain
<SuperBrony64> My computer uses an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 Ghz, 2 GB RAM, GeForce 8600 GT w/ 256 MB, etc.
<Shutterfly> i have expanded ram though
<Jigglysaint> then when my girlfriend calls and I have to explain why I ddin't sleep all night
<Jigglysaint> that I was up watching ponies
<Sumica> Well even if you lock up you can come back in Jigglysaint

<SuperBrony64> Should be fine, just not during movie night I believe.
<Trainguyxx> im not to fond of that whole site though

<Jigglysaint> http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/ask-thatguy/32441-episode-63?comment_id=558733#josc558733
<Shutterfly> its only a 30 day trial
<crono_flash> Hello everyone. I have Jigglysaint.
<TerraH> I love the Nostalgia Chick's review of the MLP movie! XD
<Natleyn> If you just idle for a bit, continue becomes clickable
<Jigglysaint> oh
<Trainguyxx> i dont know why, but they kinda get on my nerves soemtimes
<Jigglysaint> it has to do with MLP
<Sumica> after trial time you just have to wait 30 secons to load it up
<Shutterfly> oh
<Shutterfly> why even do that
<Shutterfly> whats the point
<Jigglysaint> well ever since some weird bronies attacked Lupa's review
<Sumica> to anoy you in to buying
<Shutterfly> i guess
<Trainguyxx> what do you mean attacked
<Shutterfly> its not very effective
<Trainguyxx> it doesnt sound very brony-ish
<Sumica> it's like that popup on winraw
<Shutterfly> lol
<Trainguyxx> lol
<Trainguyxx> perfect.
<SuperBrony64> Glomped is the appropriate substitution for Attacked.
<Trainguyxx> XD
<Shutterfly> i hate those programs that use like a screen wide frame
<Jigglysaint> well one of the reviewrs, Obscureous Lupa did a reivew of The Princess Prominade
<Jigglysaint> but did not mention G4
<TerraH> Oh no?
<Trainguyxx> doesnt sioudn that terrible
<Jigglysaint> so some bronies got mad and asked why she didn't mention them
<TerraH> So what?
<Natleyn> Dang DCD, you're flying through these menus
<Jigglysaint> this caused Linkara and Spoony to jump to her defense
<TerraH> Good for them! I like those two
<NewDCD> 9I know my SRW menus by heart
<SuperBrony64> Haha
<NewDCD> 9how do you think I can play the Japanese-only games like Z2=
<Sumica> I should hope so.
<SuperBrony64> …You understand Japanese?
<Trainguyxx> i just thought you knew japanese?
<Trainguyxx> HAH PERFECT
<Natleyn> Nah.
<Trainguyxx> ninja'd
<Shutterfly> wow thats some intense muscle memory
<MUTANTPANDA521> Who likes fluttershy?
<crono_flash> I started playing that a few weeks back NewDCD
<NewDCD> 9I know SRW-ese
<TerraH> ME!
<NewDCD> 9recognize the Hiragana a bit
<Shutterfly> MUTANTPANDA521: me
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy is the best pony, duh.
<NewDCD> 9know what commands make you fly and such
<Shutterfly> SuperBrony64: brohoof
<NewDCD> 9the menus ain't so hard
<Trainguyxx> I like pinkie pie more =D
*SuperBrony64 brohoofs Shutterfly back
<TerraH> I know the romanji so much more than I do any characters
<Jigglysaint> It's a three-way between Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Fluttershy
<MUTANTPANDA521> pinkie pie is my second favorite
<Jigglysaint> tie, a 3 way tie
<Shutterfly> god
<Shutterfly> good catch there
<Trainguyxx> jiggly, ponies and three way should not be in the same sentence
<awolf> FIRE NUKES
<Sumica> suddely homework.
<Natleyn> What kind?
<Jigglysaint> I mean 3 way tie for favorite pony
<Trainguyxx> thats a bit better XD
<TrollightSparkle> Oh favorite pony now?
<TerraH> I like Pinkie, Flutter, Dash and Rarity... I could take or leave AJ and Twilight
<TrollightSparkle> Twilight pony. Nuff said.
<SuperBrony64> I wonder what your favorite pony is TrollightSparkle...
<TrollightSparkle> XD
<Trainguyxx> it's fluttershy
<Trainguyxx> dont be fooled
<Jigglysaint> Rainbow Dash always dresses in style
<Trainguyxx> =/
<Sumica> nah she likes nix
<TerraH> I like twilit spackle!
<SuperBrony64> I like Twilight Sparkle as well, I think she definitely is up there next to Fluttershy
<Trainguyxx> you mean, she wears ntohign at all?
<FreezeFrame> I like all the ponies (except Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara)
<boxy> pfft its all about vinyal
<MUTANTPANDA521> boxy
<Shutterfly> i im tied between twilight + fluttershy
<IrOnLoRe> So, i guess i should say I'm kinda, new to the brony thing. I only recently, watched the whole entire first series an i must say, it's really good. lol
<TerraH> tilit spackle spiderses!!
<SuperBrony64> So tough to make decisions >_<
<Jigglysaint> also it should be canon that Sweetie Belle's parents, and by extention, Rarity's, are two rainbows
<FreezeFrame> I do prefer Rarity and Cheerilee, though.
<awolf> stupid sexy rainbow dash
<Trainguyxx> 1980's cheerilee
<MUTANTPANDA521> pinkie pie has some good songs though...
<Shutterfly> IrOnLoRe: in agreement.
<Sumica> DCD is trying to look likes he's doing homework instead of gameing =p
<SuperBrony64> IrOnLoRe: Glad you like it, now you'll get the chance to pass your initiation, which is the Season 1 marathon.
<Shutterfly> wait y u browse in spanish
<Trainguyxx> who cares
<Trainguyxx> or
<Sumica> Check the get to know us page Shutterfly
<Trainguyxx> maybe it's cause his mother cant read it
<SuperBrony64> The ultimate Brony test, Season 1 Marathon without stopping.
