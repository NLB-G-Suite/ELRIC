<Espeon> 06:3!
<Espeon> 06Silky smooth I hope
<Espeon> 06Or fluffy
<Espeon> 06Or both
<Espeon> 06Hopefully both
*Espeon dies

<Sparky||Index> yay :D
<Sakuya> Silky smooth
<Sparky||Index> o3o
<Sparky||Index> the Espeon fur?
<Sakuya> Very soft
<Sakuya> Not extremely fluffy, but perfect for espeons
<Espeon> 06That's just as it should be
<Espeon> 06Soft but not Flareon
<Espeon> 06And silkyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
<Sakuya> Yep
<Sakuya> And it will be life suze
<Sakuya> Size
<Luna> Are you got at making plushies Sakuya?
<Sakuya> So yes
<Luna> *good
<Espeon> 06:3!
<Espeon> 06That's a lot of Espeon
<Sakuya> Um, id say so
<Sakuya> Yes it is, but enough its never enough
<Luna> I'm curious, do you have a picture I can see?
<Sakuya> I almost got another two yards to fulfill my wish of an espeon sofa
<Sakuya> Yeh um
<Luna> There's so many interesting people in this channel, and I never bother to talk to them
<Sakuya> Sparky
<Sparky||Index> yes?
<Sparky||Index> flareon is a puff
<Sakuya> Do me a favor and grab the link to my plush folder in my da gallery
<Sparky||Index> sure
<Sakuya> I'm on my phone atn
<Sakuya> Atm
<Sparky||Index> yes'm :3
<Espeon> 06Flareon, cloudeon.
<Sakuya> Cloudeon
<Sakuya> Just pictured it
<Sparky||Index> http://sareii.deviantart.com/gallery/24258694
<Sparky||Index> ...
<Sparky||Index> that
<Sparky||Index> would be so floory
<Sakuya> Luna that's my gallery there
<Sparky||Index> *floofy
<Sakuya> yes it would
<Luna> Thank you very much!
<Sakuya> And since my mind is floof enough
<Luna> o.O I watch you...
<Sakuya> It went floof exponentially
<Sakuya> Oh you do? Lol
<Iskierka> that sounds a lot creepier than it's supposed to
<Iskierka> but okay
<Luna> I watch you.... sleep
<Sakuya> Lol
<Luna> But yes, I don't go on dA much, I've no clue who I watch
<Luna> I really like the Kyuubey plush
<Sakuya> Thanks, that thing scares me though
<Sakuya> The eyes are a little better than I wanted
<Sakuya> They always see you
<Sakuya> Always into your soul
<Luna> Just like the real Kyuubey!
<Kyubey> 02Want a wish? :3
<Sakuya> Which makes it creepier
<Luna> I'd love to take up plushie making, but I don't have much talent for sowing
<Sakuya> It takes an insane amount of logic and thought
<Luna> Yeah, I'd imagine
<Sakuya> Like right now I'm sketching patterns for this next one
<Skylands> 10Hi Max
<Skylands> 10Oh, nevermind
<Luna> you can do it from scratch?
<Sakuya> yeah that'swhat I've been doing
<Sakuya> None of these are preexisting
<Sakuya> I made them all from scratch
<Luna> ...
<Luna> THAT'S why I watch you
<Luna> I had no clue that was you Aurora
<Aurora> ...lol
<Aurora> I forgot I had my phone name
<Aurora> And that not everyone knows the difference
<Luna> You've inspired me, I think I might try to make a plushie since I've nothing better to do
<Aurora> Its hard, but so worth it
<Luna> I don't frequent the channel much, so I don't associate certain names with others
<Aurora> I always get depressed drawing something, and I can't physically hug it
<Aurora> So I make up for it like this
<Luna> I'd imagine, my room would be filled with plushies if I had that talent
<Aurora> And since I'm highly critical of pushes at stores
<Aurora> I do my best
<Link> o_o
<Link> Mega Netsplit
<Luna> Do you have to order the material online or would a local fabric store have what is needed?
<Pattyrick> It's best to know geography before doing a fail on it
<Pattyrick> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kqattk2plw1qzit7go1_500.jpg
<Luna> I wonder if you horizontally flipped a continent, how many people would still recognize it
<Ray> 02They are all in the graveyard
<Ray> 02dead, of course
<Ray> 02:D
<Aurora> Depends
<Aurora> What continent, and what direction?
<Pattyrick> GoD?
<Aurora> As for fabric, I normally just browse in stores
<Pattyrick> That's true
<Pattyrick> I've seen a map of the world upside down, and it looks a lot different
<Aurora> This is the first time I've known what I need and bought it specially online
<Luna> Actually, maybe not, the shapes are pretty recognizable, even upside down or fipped
<prince-dari> Need to open up my comp, BRB.
<prince-dari> Need to open up my comp, BRB.

<SilverSonic> wb
<Drake> 04thanks
<Drake> 04'Sup Manly?
*Quanyails 7finds some good 8-bit remixes randomly.
<Manlyguy> I am... waiting for a game to download. lol
<Manlyguy> You? lol
<Drake> 04Pretty good, just messin' around with random things after playing tF2
<Drake> 04TF2*
*Pattyrick bangs head on desk again to stay awake
<Manlyguy> I swear, I'm unable to get into that game. I turn it on, play one match, get bored, then play a different game.
<Drake> 04ditto
<Drake> 04I'm beginning to wonder whether it is worth 10GB of space lol
<Manlyguy> I've gotten too used to Sci-Fi shooters. TF2 just isn't fast-paced enough for my tastes.
<Manlyguy> Yeah, lol, same.
<Bakphoon> hehe
<Drake> 04I'm too used to Halo where everyone is the same
<Bakphoon> I play GG2 because it's more fun
<Bakphoon> in my opinion
<Bakphoon> I paid for my TF2 even
<Bakphoon> and I never play it
<Bakphoon> half because it overheats my system and half because it's boring and there are those no-lifers who spend too much time playing it
<Manlyguy> I'm just not used to the class switching.
<Bakphoon> i'm used to classes
<Bakphoon> because of gg2 mostly
<Manlyguy> I prefer having everything under my belt and just whipping it out.
<Manlyguy> It's more convenient.
<Pattyrick> You know what's convenient?
<Pattyrick> Microwaves
<Bakphoon> it's a different style, it's not for everyone
<Bakphoon> i honestly like both styles
<Manlyguy> Lol, Patrick.
<Pattyrick> but seriously, they are pretty convenient
<Bakphoon> class-based and weapon-based
<Manlyguy> I prefer old-fashioned shooters, really.
<Pattyrick> makes cooking fast and bleh xD
<Bakphoon> at one point i played doom a lot
<Bakphoon> not too long ago
<Bakphoon> because i was like "fnck yeah doom"
<Manlyguy> Doom is my life. Well, part of it, haha.
<Sparky> 'kay
<Sparky> bye
<Bakphoon> oh bye then
<Sparky|Walk> I need to get off this computer
<Sparky|Walk> SOEMTIME TODAY
<Pattyrick> so do I
<Manlyguy> Good goal. lol
<Quanyails> 7MAY
<Quanyails> 7*late*
<May> 14Hi Quan :>
<Quanyails> 7So, about your available time for your game...
<Quanyails> 7How does the vicinity of 5:00 to 6:00 AM GMT sound?
<Drake> 04MAY
<Drake> 04MAY
<Drake> 04MAY
<Drake> 04MAY
*Drake glomps
<Pattyrick> LOL May, the one who locked up Drake from Ascendant
*Pattyrick runs
*May isn't exactly in the mood to discuss times right now since she probably has to shop for a new tablet.
<Pattyrick> A drawing tablet?
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7I thought about getting one two weeks ago.
<Quanyails> 7But I'm mostly a pixel artist.
<Quanyails> 7And I tried one out on my friend's laptop.
<Quanyails> 7I wish it was like paper where you directly saw where you were drawing. o3o
<Drake> 04Tablets do help with pixel art Quan
<Drake> 04Especially for getting the base shape.
<May> 14Well, after a few days worth of working my butt off, I get a chance to actually draw on my tablet rather than sketching (not that I don't want to, I just haven't had practice for the tablet) I go to plug in my tablet and it decides not to work.
<Pattyrick> Aww D=
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<May> 14It won't light up, so you can't tell if it's even on or not, but even trying to draw on it won't work.
<Pattyrick> I hate it when stuff stops working
<Pattyrick> like my computer
<Quanyails> 7Well, I'm unfortunately not a tablet expert.
<May> 14Now, I'm not sure if some idiot decided to replace my cables, or if it's just that the entire thing isn't working.
<Quanyails> 7Is it warranted?
<May> 14It's been over a year since I got it.
<Pattyrick> You never used it before?
<May> 14But my main concern: The USB head that's supposed to be plugged in to the device fits, but it seems to be a different shape than the socket.
<May> 14Pattyrick, hardly.
<May> 14Because I was always moving around and never was able to unpack it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Goodnight all :3
<Ray> 02Night Angel~
<Pattyrick> Goodnight AE =D
<May> 14Also, it's really hard to take out the cord too.
<May> 14But easy to plug in.
<May> 14Which I think is majorily off.
<May> 14And I'm going to be even angrier if my "sister" decided to barge into my room and touch my things.
<May> 14I'm going to try and search my room if there's another cord that happens to be hidden away somewhere.
<May> 14Or else I'm going on eBay and looking for a different cord.
<Pattyrick> ahhh, ebay
<Pattyrick> my dad's alternative to Value Village
<Manlyguy> . -.
<SilverSonic> I HAS THE OOT3D SOUNDTRACK <3
<Pattyrick> Do they have those in california?

<nickstr> I would not either
<nickstr> and its not a "shame" either
<Light_Latias> o-o
<nickstr> the system has not proven its self

<HyperMetalLugia> Well, it will eventually :p
<nickstr> its still in the HEYZ LUK WEZ HAVE 3D!
<nickstr> stage
<Luna> And the whole 3D stage is getting annoying
<Luna> I don't understand why everything needs to be in 3D
<nickstr> is sort of pointless
<nickstr> except for VR
<Glacymr> 12then turn off the 3D
<HyperMetalLugia> And don't whine?
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Manlyguy> Turn off the 3D. That's funny. xD
<Luna> Well, I could get the anti-3D glasses off of Think Geek
<Luna> It's difficult to turn off 3D when I live in it
<HyperMetalLugia> Wut
<Manlyguy> They should make Game and Watch remakes for the 3DS. In 3D. That'd be a buy for me.
<HyperMetalLugia> They did
<Luna> It'd look something like Paper Mario?
<HyperMetalLugia> Sorta- http://www.joystiq.com/2011/07/14/nintendoware-weekly-netflix-game-and-watch-gallery-3d-pixel-rac/
<Manlyguy> Close enough? lol
<Manlyguy> I was talking actual remakes, but I guess we can't have it all.
<Luna> Netflix on the 3DS? O.o
<Luna> Can it handle that?
<HyperMetalLugia> Hurp derp
<Armageddon> o_O
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<Armageddon> argh fuck
<nickstr> Netflix is basically screwing themselves over now
<Luna> I knooow
<HyperMetalLugia> Why?
<nickstr> by unbundling streaming and DVD rentals
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Luna> Did you see the Blockbuster guy taking advantage of it
<nickstr> you have to pay for each one separately
<Luna> ?
<Armageddon> what the fuck
<Armageddon> <@EpicStatsGuy> Flame: online · Rainbow: offline · Shadowfire: offline · Soarwing: online · Solstice: offline · Tintower: offline · Sacred: online · Legendary: online
<nickstr> its something like $6.99 a month for each one
<Armageddon> actually no ESG is just being a fucker
<nickstr> the total I heard for having both is close to $17 a month

<peer> trollface.jpg
<Luna> Yep
<Luna> Though, tbh
<eXAKR> Wow
<HyperMetalLugia> WB Sky
<Luna> I have Netflix and never used the rental service
<eXAKR> Peer joined, I disconnect
<eXAKR> Coincidence?
*eXAKR hides
<Drake> 04Gah
<Skylands> 10What happened
<eXAKR> !cynder
<Drake> 04I reeeeeeeally hate it when Spore glitches up
<SilverSonic> I hate the peer script ;p
<eXAKR> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to eXAKR for 9 minutes
<Drake> 04Especially when you've only JUST reached the Space stage.
<eXAKR> lol
<Armageddon> apparently that doesn't work
<Drake> 04There's alwaysd this planet you need to go to for a tutorial - you scan a crashed spaceship - but unfortunately on this save file, the planet glitched up and didn't spawn the spaceship.
<nickstr> looks like you need to drop the DVD rental then Luna
<nickstr> if you only stream
<Drake> 04Now I'm stuck and can't do anything - I'll have to go back and REMAKE MY CREATURE, REMAKE MY CIVILIZATION AND EVERYTHING
<nickstr> then maybe you will be fine
<nickstr> I don't know
<Luna> Yeah
<Luna> They're being bold
<Luna> But I don't think it's going to matter much
<Luna> Because you can get apps on just your TV now
<Luna> And just about any gaming system has Netflix, people will still pay to stream from their house
<Luna> Or just not pay at all, depending on the kind of people they are
<Drake> 04Quan
<Drake> 04get your @$$ on TF2
<Quanyails> 7Hmm?
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<nickstr> I actually found my own method for streaming videos to game consoles over networks
<Drake> 04I wanted to see your reaction to that
<Quanyails> 7Why?
<nickstr> PMP Streamer
<Drake> 04It was lulzy
<Luna> PMP?
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Drake> 04Because no one is playing and it's boring by myself.
<nickstr> Portable Media Player
<Quanyails> 7Lurk about until the community game, if/when I set it up. D:
<Drake> 04Capture the Flag is always fun
<Sathi> 7goodnight!
<Luna> Aaah, yeah, that works too!
<Drake> 04fien
<Quanyails> 7Except when it's turtlefort. :P
<Drake> 04lol
<Quanyails> 7I'm spriting, so thank you for taking a nibble out of my time. XD
<Drake> 042fort is fun
<Drake> 04You're welcome
<Manlyguy> I'd jump on, but ya know... game downloading. lol
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Quanyails> 7It is?
<Quanyails> 7:O
<Manlyguy> Lol, no, I meant I'm downloading another game.
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7I thought you meant update. o3o
<Ascendant> o_O

<Ascendant> DRAKE
<Ascendant> It's weird
<Ascendant> I had a nightmare last night
<HyperMetalLugia> O>lo
<Quanyails> 7About?

<Ray> 02YOU WERE HIS WIFE?
<Quanyails> 7I'd love to indulge in a bizarre sleep I had two nights ago.
<Ascendant> lolwut
<Ascendant> well
<HyperMetalLugia> I have had terrible dreams recently
<HyperMetalLugia> x.x
<Ascendant> basically, my mum and my bro were creating these lolwtf huge snakes by pouring some sort of crap over normal snakes
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLwat
<Ascendant> and then sending them out to destroy everything or something
<Ascendant> and then
<HyperMetalLugia> Too much Spykids?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
*nickstr np: Reba McEntire - How Was I to Know [03:40m/256kbps/44kHz]
<Ascendant> the first one that went out
<Ascendant> came over this volcano thing
<Ascendant> which "infected" it or something, or so the evil/mean lady there said
<Ascendant> and then stuff happened
<Ascendant> and then I woke up
<nickstr> ah yes, its kind of neat being able to play your own selection of music over an unmodified clock radio
*HyperMetalLugia 's dream consisted of his parents hating him and leaving the home
*Ascendant goes wat
*Skylands wonders what Ascendant is rambling about
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<Ascendant> Skylands, nightmare
<eXAKR> Talk about weird dreams
<Ascendant> dunno if it means anything
<HyperMetalLugia> same here
<Skylands> 10Ascendant has nightmares? :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I had a nightmare too :<
<Ascendant> I haven't had a nightmare for ages
<Manlyguy> Lol, that dream sounds awesome, though.
<HyperMetalLugia> My dream means something
<Skylands> 10Tbh Ascendant
<Ascendant> I RARELY have nightmares
<HyperMetalLugia> I never dream anyway
<SilverSonic> LOL did youo wake up in the middle of the Night NS XD
<eXAKR> I can't remember having a nightmare recently
<Quanyails> 7I've had a strange dream where I was out in this park, and someone threw this razor-bladed frisbee in the air.
<Skylands> 10You seem like a person who doesn't afraid of anything
<SilverSonic> or did you sleep though it XD
<Skylands> 10No lie.
<Ascendant> SilverSonic I woke up at 11am
<Ascendant> after the nightmare
<Quanyails> 7The deadly disc circled around until it aimed at my neck.
<eXAKR> Though a few years back I kept having bad dreams and nightmares involving monsters and ghosts
<Ascendant> so I was like "oh crap what the hell, when did it get this late"
<Ascendant> lolwut
<nickstr> I have not had nightmares in years
<Quanyails> 7I then felt a very REAL sharp pain there in real life.
<eXAKR> Quanyails: oO
<Ascendant> o-O
<Quanyails> 7And then I woke up. o3o
<Light_Latias> o.o
<Ascendant> and Skylands
<HyperMetalLugia> Quanyails has creepy dreams
<eXAKR> I had a nightmare once where there were a lot of monster cars
<HyperMetalLugia> .o
<Ascendant> that would usually be the case :p
<Quanyails> 7Naw, that was just one oddity.
<eXAKR> Like that one in that car with tentacles movie, but worse oO;
<Luna> I had a dream a very long time where Megatron chased me through the woods
<Luna> *time ago

<NightSeas> 12Must be your computer. DSLs speed greatly depends on your computers speed

<Ascendant> It's not YOU who has 2GB of bandwidth per month
<NightSeas> 12What are you insinuating?
<Ascendant> I am saying that you should stop telling me stupid things that aren't true
<Ascendant> and DSL speeds do not necessarily depend on the computer speed - it relies on the amount of data the network card can handle and how much data the computer can take
<NightSeas> 12Heh, well I just know the basics
<Ascendant> then don't tell me things that I don't need to know
<NightSeas> 12Well, you know how many people don't know that?
<NightSeas> 12Lots
<Ascendant> no one that wants to hear it atm, and you were telling it to me and not someone else :p

<Ascendant> !say !FLOOF!
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<drfsupercenter> 03it doesn't actually show it?
<Ascendant> it's spamfiltered
<Ascendant> it blocks and kills
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03weird
<Ascendant> I blame Draelen
<Ascendant> F cpN kill 0 132407595 86400 Excess_floof Draelen!Admin@draelen.co.uk :!FLOOF!
<Ascendant> F is just the stats thing
<Ascendant> cpN shows where the spamfilter is applied, and in this case, it's in a channel, channel notice or PM
<Ascendant> kill shows what action is taken, for example, a gline, gzline, block, warning, or kill...which is what it is in this case
<drfsupercenter> 03so if you were to type Quit: Mibbit whatever default message, it would kill you ? XD
<Ascendant> Excess_floof is the reason, and _ is translated to a space
<Ascendant> Draelen!Admin@draelen.co.uk is the oper that added it
<Ascendant> and :stuff is the regex/what is said, minus the :
<Ascendant> and well
<Ascendant> F q kill 0 45750300 86400 Quit:_This_is_my_graThe_trainer_blocked_the_ball!_l2_59_ERROR Draelen!Admin@TST-9C4C89FF.go.rawr.at.googledragon.com :http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client
<Ascendant> only if you typed http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client
<Ascendant> as your quit message
<Ascendant> it'd translate to Quit:_This_is_my_graThe_trainer_blocked_the_ball!_l2_59_ERROR as the quit message instead
<drfsupercenter> 03where does it mention quit
<Ascendant> and since it's a raw kill, not a client kill

<Ascendant> I made a pretty simple mIRC script the other day
<Ascendant> brings on any number of clones that you specify, and it connects to a specified server and channel
<Ascendant> then you do /startspam and then it continuously spams the channel using those clients, and the great thing about it is that it can do well over 100 lines without being killed for excess flood :D
<Ascendant> as you can tell, I was bored
<Ascendant> >|
<junh1024-XD> it'd be really great for #PM
*junh1024-XD hides
<Ascendant> roooooofl
<Ascendant> use muhstik or clonesxs :p
<Ascendant> clonesxs only runs on mIRC as it's a mIRC script, and muhstik was originally created for linux, but there's apparently a windows version
<Ascendant> there's other stuff out there like cloneflooder but those are the two most popular ones...not sure about clonesxs though
<Ascendant> also Kyu, you need to help me with my pokemon battle script ;_;
<Ascendant> the calculations are doing my head in

<lightumbreon> 06thanks
<lightumbreon> 06ah well, going to game for a while :3
<Pattyrick> ok
<Pattyrick> enjoy! =D
<Quanyails> 7WHOO.
<Quanyails> 7I had two crazy dreams last night.
<Pattyrick> I probably had a dream, but I usually forget them instantly =\
<Quanyails> 7One had me trying to collect some stuff I had that a teacher threw out. Which involved going to an aquarium with seals and stopping by its local incinerator.
<Pattyrick> 0__o
<Quanyails> 7The second was vivid and fun; I, with two other people, were trying to find a person's craiglist account. For two different reasons:
<Quanyails> 7The first, 'realistic' reason, the first part of my dreams, was because another Illinois governor wanted to sell his seat. :U
<Pattyrick> LOL
<Quanyails> 7It somehow transitioned into a bizarre mix of TF2 and Pokemon, where I had to send my Emboar out and teach it Heat Crash to investigate why physics somehow got awry.
<Quanyails> 7In this case, I have no idea why I had to crack on the computer, except to find some essential data.
<Quanyails> 7Once I found the data, I went onto Steam (yes, in real life), and connected on TF2 and went on the same 'server', or real place in life, as my friends.
<Pattyrick> wow
<Pattyrick> that's pretty interesting...
<Pattyrick> I wish I had dreams that were as interesting
<Pattyrick> I once had a dream about raising a Riolu
<Pattyrick> but I woke up just as it was evolving into Lucario D=
<Quanyails> 7I'm not done!
<Quanyails> 7When I was connecting (which resembled me travelling through some sort of warphole), I thought about a prankI could do, and mentioned it to my Emboar. My Emboar called on his cellphone(?) that I was coming.
<Quanyails> 7-l
<Quanyails> 7Now, my friends were on the staircase of this regal, Victorian hotel.
<Quanyails> 7Which happened to have this long air vent that was above the staircase and led right to them.
<Quanyails> 7I, connecting to the server, went as a Spy (:U) and cloaked, went down this chute, and backstabbed one of my friends. It took them a slight second to realize that it was me that was there. :P
<Quanyails> 7(Of course, respawn existed there, so it's not like my friend died. O_o(
<Quanyails> 7)*
<Quanyails> 7NOW that ended.
<Quanyails> 7Crazy dream, eh?
<Pattyrick> Wow
<Pattyrick> Indeed xD
<Pattyrick> I think I need to read it again to completely understand it xD
<Quanyails> 7Lol, okay.
<Quanyails> 7How much do you know about TF2?
<Drake> 04Well that was fun
<Pattyrick> Nothing
<Drake> 04Being the soldier is more fun than I though
<Pattyrick> I know what it means, but nothing of the game
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Espeon> 06All the classes can be fun, which is what's so awesome xP
<Drake> 04I still can't figure out what key is used to taunt
<Quanyails> 7G, I think.
<Quanyails> 7But I use mouse3.
<Drake> 04mouse3 is clicking the mouse wheel isn't it?
<Espeon> 06G
<Quanyails> 7Since the scroll wheel scrolls between weapons.
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Espeon> 06default, at least
<Drake> 04Yeah, my mouse3 is buggered for some reason
<Drake> 04Can't even rotate in Spore: GA Adventure Creator anymore, which really makes it difficult
<Drake> 04And thanks Xeli
<Espeon> 06I have the buttons on the side of my mouse bound to voice chat and "Thanks!" so :>
<Espeon> 06And lol :3
<Quanyails> 7:/
<Drake> 04I want a new mouse because of both that, and the fact that it keeps running out of battery
<Drake> 04I want a wired mouse
<Pattyrick> Quan is fron New Jersey?
*Drake shrugs
<Pattyrick> hmm
<Pattyrick> It's so hard to be online with friends when I'm in Italy
<Pattyrick> the time difference is weird
<YoukaiSlayer> 4Hello.
<Drake> 04I'm in Aus and Xeli is in Europe
<Pattyrick> Yup
<Drake> 04It's hell for us as well.
<Pattyrick> Norway
<Drake> 04Well
<Pattyrick> but I'm from Washington
<Drake> 04I probably have an easier time than the both of you
<Pattyrick> yeah
<Steve> 12 Hello, YoukaiSlayer and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Pattyrick> I'm 9 hours ahead of the West Coast of the USA, 6 of the East, and probaby 7 or 8 behind Eastern Australia
<YoukaiSlayer> 6Oh my god...i haven`t been here in years....
<Drake> 04I'm GMT+10
<Drake> 04Figure that
<Quanyails> 7Ahem.
<YoukaiSlayer> 6Omg STORMY
<Drake> 04wb Quan
<Quanyails> 7Thank you, Lyon.
<Quanyails> 7So, what'd I miss?
<Drake> 04You're welcome
<Pattyrick> Hem Hem
<Drake> 04Nothing much, just Pat and I raging about timezones
<Pattyrick> Us talking about the time differences
<YoukaiSlayer> 6I don`t think if you remeber me but its me DarkCynder22~! v.v
<Pattyrick> Based on your join info, you're in NJ?
<Drake> 04Only 3 days left of school holidays...
<Drake> 04It's depressing
<Quanyails> 7Tri-state area. o3o
<Pattyrick> lol
<Pattyrick> brb
<Drake> 04Hey Quan
<Drake> 04Do you write alot?
<Quanyails> 7Write? Don't have time to, unfortunately.
<Drake> 04And as a follow-up question, do you have any large/enourmous story ideas that you have just sitting around in the back of your head?
<Drake> 04Ah
<Quanyails> 7My imagination is pretty sharp, as you can see from my dreams. :P
<Quanyails> 7Well, sort of.
<Quanyails> 7The sequel to a year-old fanfic.
<Steve> 12 Hello, YoukaiSlayer and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Quanyails> 7I have it incomplete. D:
<Drake> 04H-uh
<Quanyails> 7It was supposed to be done by the time BBS came out. XD
<Drake> 04How large do you usually tend to estimate your stories to be?
<Drake> 04...heh
<Drake> 04Missed that deadline
<Quanyails> 7I'd say 10000 words.
<Quanyails> 7About.
<Quanyails> 7I don't write novels.
<Drake> 04Hmm
<Drake> 04Well that's the complete opposite of me
<Drake> 04I really think I think about my stories too often
<Drake> 04My spyro fanfic alone is planned to have at least 4 books, each about 25 chapters long (with the last one being even longer) and several thousand words per chapter.
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Drake> 04Whereas CoE and my future/sci-fi story...well, let's not even go there.
<Drake> 04I know it's gonna bite me in the @$$ one day though.
<Drake> 04I mean, the science/sci-fi one (I haven't thought up a good name for it yet) I'm looking around around 7 'books'
<Drake> 04Probably even more knowing my habit of expanding upon every single tidbit.
<Drake> 04And given how scientifically accurate I'm trying to make it...
<Quanyails> 7Try and make that story for NaNoWrMo. :P
<Drake> 04It took me a while to remember what that was since we don't have that over here
<Drake> 04but hey, 7 books in a month? SURE /sarcasm
<Drake> 04Besides, I'm trying to focus on DoI(Spyro fanfic) so I DON'T get overwhelmed.
<Pattyrick> back
<Quanyails> 7I'm not sure how well this works for you, but here's an idea:
<Quanyails> 7Write the story in complete, but half-baked.
<Quanyails> 7Then go over it and edit it.
<Drake> 04Oh that would kill me
<Drake> 04Whenever I write, I push myself to make sure EVERYTHING is right, all continuities are correct, everything is explained properly (unless the plot calls for it) and that there are tiny little details like someone'se movements or the placement of an objects that hint at something in the future.
<Quanyails> 7Well, that might work to your advantage.
<Quanyails> 7You've written an entire story. Now go back and perfect it.
<Drake> 04...maybe
<Drake> 04Depends if I'm busy with DoI or not, since that's my major focus at the moment.
<Drake> 04But hey, sounds like a good idea.
<Pattyrick> the Coca-Cola here in Italy is awesome
<Drake> 04...I also hate how I've basically MADE the LoS series my own ._.;
<Pattyrick> better than in the States
<Drake> 04Haha nice cut-in Pat
*Drake pats
<Pattyrick> lol, sorry
<Pattyrick> just had to say it xD
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I had that dream I just spat out. :P
<Quanyails> 7Amazing how detailed they are, eh?
<Pattyrick> Yeah
<Quanyails> 7I could go on for a few more sentences about them.
<Quanyails> 7Should I? X3
<Pattyrick> and that you can remember them that vividly
<Pattyrick> sure, why not? xD
<Quanyails> 7All right.
<Pattyrick> I didn't hear the 2nd reason
<Quanyails> 7I like these vivid dreams, because unlike rather blurry, indistinct ones, they feel real.
<Pattyrick> I know what you mean
<Quanyails> 7Your sense of logic and skepticism is rather suppressed in a dream.
<Drake> 04I never have really vivid dreams
<Quanyails> 7So you sort of enjoy your dream environment to its fullest.
<Pattyrick> mmmhmm
<Pattyrick> Same here
<Pattyrick> and even when I do, I never remember them =\
<Quanyails> 7So it's like a portal to fantasy. :D
<Pattyrick> in fact
<Quanyails> 7And it's spectacular what you may find there.
<Quanyails> 7Even if it's a mix of TF2 and pokemon. O_o
<Pattyrick> I had one that I knew was awesome, but I very sparesely remember it
<Drake> 04I remember having this one dream when I was really young, I was Chewbacca running away from droids through a primary school playground.
<Pattyrick> lol, Chewbacca xD
*Quanyails 7hmms.
<Drake> 04Oh, and I also got a story idea from one - About psychics in a steampunk world running away from a corrupt government.
<Pattyrick> Raaawww!
<Drake> 04Ah, good times.
<Pattyrick> And the droids
<Pattyrick> with their weird voices
<Pattyrick> 'After him, NOOOOOWW!'
<Pattyrick> 'Roger roger.'
<Pattyrick> What's a steampunk?
<Drake> 04It's difficult to explain so I summon 'Wikipedia' into the encounter for 5 turns at the cost of 150 MP
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk
<Pattyrick> hmm
<Pattyrick> sorry for interrupting, I sometimes tend to do that without realizing it =|
*Quanyails 7lol'd.
<Drake> 04lol That's fine
<Pattyrick> please continue what you were saying
<Drake> 04It's not like I don't do that
<Drake> 04OH I wasn't saying anything else
*Quanyails 7is alternating between this and spriting.
<Drake> 04But hey, psychics in a steampunk world - you gotta admit, that's pretty cool
<Quanyails> 7Indeed.
<Quanyails> 7http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/1962/suigunoiv.png <-- Old doodle in a planner. :U
<Quanyails> 7Current WIP.
<Drake> 04H-uh
<Drake> 04Nice sketch
<Quanyails> 7It's only adequate. o3o
<Pattyrick> that's a good drawing =D
<Drake> 04If you say so
<Drake> 04I happen to disagree
<Quanyails> 7Well, it's a sketch, if anything.
<Quanyails> 7And it's not really significant in any aspect. O_o
<Drake> 04http://i51.tinypic.com/6sszo3.jpg
<Drake> 04That's a sketch
<Drake> 04My first actualy sketch in two months

<Quanyails> 7Naw, yours has more detail and a better pose.
<Quanyails> 7I could argue tidbits in editing.
<Drake> 04Face is too long
<Drake> 04Horns are too thin
<Drake> 04wing isn't in the right position and has too many folds
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I don't know Spyro's style. :P
<Drake> 04Which hide the back and tailbase
<Quanyails> 7So it's okay to me.
<Drake> 04It's not spyro's style, it's my style.
<Pattyrick> yours isn't bad either, Drake
<Drake> 04Admittedly, I stole a bit from CASF and other spyro artists but still...
<Drake> 04Oh, and the left (our left) paw is too large, and the arm is too concealed

<Quanyails> 7<<
<Quanyails> 7Lyon?
<Drake> 04Aye?
<Quanyails> 7Do you think, on dA, you could recommend me for a DD? XD
<Drake> 04...How do I do that?
<Quanyails> 7PM one of the gallery moderators about a suggestion (depending on the medium), and wait for a response.
<Quanyails> 7Let me get the list of which mods for which types of art.
<Drake> 04Ok then...
<Quanyails> 7http://help.deviantart.com/18/
<Drake> 04They need something simpler
<Drake> 04Like something where you just click and it says "Thank you for your vote!"
<Quanyails> 7Well, we wouldn't want suggestion-spam. :P
<Drake> 04True there
<Quanyails> 7So, eh, could you? ^^;
<Drake> 04Sure. Is there a particular piece you'd like recommended?
<Quanyails> 7Do you think of any?
<Quanyails> 7Personally, I like Tynamo in Chargestone cave...
<Quanyails> 7Cave&
<Quanyails> 7Cave*
<Drake> 04Well I thought of that traditional image where the ball & chin was attached to you...
<Drake> 04chain*
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Quanyails> 7?
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai LU :3
<Drake> 04I can't find it, that's all
<Espeon> 06Angel_Espeon you've been sneaking your way in here or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm a ninja, I can't help it :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon still belongs to Angel_Espeon for 16 more minutes
<Drake> 04I remember you drew an image of a ball & chain, with the chain seemingly 'coming out' of the paper and attaching to your arm.
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o LOL k
<Drake> 04Or was it you?
<Espeon> 06and okay I had to browse somewhere I could click your icon to get to your profile without getting a 404 Quan
<Drake> 04I can't remember
<Espeon> 06That's odd, silly da
<Espeon> 3[6!6espeon vars 4reset3]
<Quanyails> 7Erm, nope.
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 12 minutes
<Quanyails> 7If you mean the one with two hands, one 3d, one 2d...
<Drake> 04Hmm, nevermind.
<Drake> 04If I may ask Quan, why the sudden urge to get a DD?
<Quanyails> 7Was looking at DDs for pixel art.
<Quanyails> 7That person named Light Ho-Oh or something got one for something simpler. O.o
<Drake> 04Link?
<Espeon> 06lol DD's
<Quanyails> 7http://light-ho-oh.deviantart.com/art/COMMISSION-fakemon-icons-173445516
<Espeon> 06It seems like they work in some kind of odd way that no one fully understands
<Espeon> 06But I'd say if that gets a DD you should get one too Quan, but I know nothing about spriting and I'm just judging on "That looks really good"-factor alone
*Espeon flops
<Quanyails> 7It's much simpler than what I do. :P
<Quanyails> 7But maybe I'm trying too hard in some aspects which makes it worse. O_o
<Quanyails> 7Or maybe it's because I'm relatively unknown.
<Quanyails> 7How do I check how many people watch me?
<Drake> 04Um
<Drake> 04What?
<Drake> 04Why did that get a DD
<Quanyails> 7I know.
<Quanyails> 7Then again, emoticons get DDs.
<Quanyails> 7For example...
<Espeon> 06there's better examples of DD's how do they work, trust me
<Espeon> 06In all categories
<Drake> 04Well
<Drake> 04Some emoticon DDs are deserving because of the great detail and effort put into them, especially that hospital one I saw a while back
<Quanyails> 7No, this one was very simple.
<Quanyails> 7Mrr, I can't find it. O_o
<Quanyails> 7Well, I'll describe it.
<Quanyails> 7An emoticon watches a pixel fly (one dot) hover back and forth.
<Drake> 04...That's all?
<Quanyails> 7Yep.

<Purple`Prose> ...and now I have the Pink Panther theme in my head
<prince-dari> Haha, the Pink Panther is win.
<Purple`Prose> Who would be the poor pony Pinkie torments, though?
<Dee_Twenty> Twilight, who else? :p

<eXAKR> Why this?
<Jerry> eXAKR: yes
<eXAKR> Anyway
<eXAKR> I broke my glasses today
<eXAKR> and I have two job interviews on Monday :(

<eXAKR> Jerry: what
<eXAKR> and why this transferring all over the place?
<Jerry> not all over the place
<eXAKR> Yeah but
<Jerry> I just can't really get used to it and such, i'm better off in my old school
<eXAKR> From Mayflower to Balestier Hill (if I remember correctly) and back to Mayflower
<eXAKR> Why the transfer in the first place?
<Jerry> I made it in a rash decision,
<Jerry> because I was like, okay forget it. I had enough of this crap, then ya know. I transfered. Well I regretted it
<eXAKR> Ich
<eXAKR> Guess next time you will think over your decisions carefully
<Jerry> yeah
<Jerry> and how've you been?
<eXAKR> OK
<eXAKR> Today was a bit suck though
<eXAKR> I realised I can't have coffee without anything else
<eXAKR> My body revolts
<eXAKR> And stuff happens
<eXAKR> and then my job interview was shifted to Monday on the last minute :(
<eXAKR> I was already starting to get ready :/

<Umbreon> 12not much
<Espeon> 06Hm
<Sathi> is mibbit having troubles?
<Sathi> cant connect to irc via web
<Elky> hi, are there really only three people in the room?
<Sathi> yea I was wondering that too
<Elky> I connected earlier, but read something about them changing the server - can you access the embedded chat on the bronystate site?
<Sathi> nope, I can't atm
<Elky> which is why I'm here too
<Elky> sprinkles said it was the right server
<Sathi> testing again, hang on
<Sathi> Connection failed (Could not connect)
<Elky> same here
<Sathi> let's hope its temporary
<Elky> I asked in the ponychan discussion thread, I guess they'll know what to do
<Soarin> hm
<Elky> ohai
<Soarin> why is it so empty in here? :C
<Soarin> hello :>
<Sathi> seems like we have technical troubles
<Elky> most likely they changed servers without telling us
<Soarin> hm I see
<Elky> hm, so apparently mibbit is derping which separates those connecting by way of the embed are in a separate server than those connecting with a client
<Elky> or something
<Soarin> apparently
<Soarin> hope they get it sorted till the movies begin
<Elky> eeyup
<Elky> but I guess by the time the movies start, everyone will just get in here if the embedded chat doesn't work
<prince-dari> Ahh, net split.
<Elky> ah, so it'll be an european chat in here?
<Elky> a*
<Sathi> hehe looks like it
<Sathi> 7 why cant I set colours as standard in my client..

<Aurora> 6I woke up and looked at the clock, 11:20am
<prince-dari> Server*
<Sathi> does it have web support?
<Elky> would it be able to handle about 300 people?
<prince-dari> Elky: Yeah, that'd be the interesting part. ;)
<prince-dari> Sathi: mIRC can connect to any server just fine.
<prince-dari> Maybe it doesn't support SSL, I don't know, but I don't use SSL anyway.

<Elky> but these aren't the mythbusters guys...
<Espeon> 06It almost hurts holding back repeating myself.
<Aurora> 6I will relax, but every time that's even mentioned, like 3 other people comment without fail
<Espeon> 06But luckily only almost.
<SilverSonic> i just said im ok with the show, since when is it illegal to give my opinion on it
<EspyLacopa> It's from the show Mythbusters.
<Aurora> 6I was looking at HML btw
<SilverSonic> Oh
<RainBroDash> >testing
<Elky> huh, I thought they always had the same two guys doing the show, but okay

*SilverSonic mauled
<RainBroDash> ^ that is how i feel right now
<Elky> xD
<prince-dari> Elky: They always have the same people, but there are different people for different countries.
<EspyLacopa> The two main guys are the 'bosses', but the other people also do some myths.
<Aurora> 6moving on
<Aurora> 6I should really....shower

<prince-dari> Because of the net split.
<RainBroDash> hey WhatPayne, glad you made it :>
<Ghosties> Where are the rest of the mods?
*Pattyrick burps fluff
<Pattyrick> there you go
*Pattyrick runs
<Ghosties> 4Soooooo
<Purple`Prose> There we go
<prince-dari> He was saying the servers wouldn't reconnect until someone with access to the server came on.
<WhatPayne> And what an effort that was
<Ghosties> 4What does it mean
<Soarin> "20:41] -Global- webchat is down until someone with access to the server appears. Sorry for the inconvenience."
<prince-dari> Then someone came on, and reconnected the servers.
<Sathi> not on this channel it seems
<Soarin> there you have the context
<prince-dari> So it's fixed now.
<Ghosties> 4So, do I need mIRC then?
<prince-dari> When you use IRC a lot, you get used to net splits.
<lighty> o.o
<Espeon> 06Fluff by mail
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> No Ghosties.
<prince-dari> Everything's fine.

<Elky> hi purple
<Ghosties> 4Meh
<WhatPayne> So what exactly happened?
<Skylands> 10Sour lemonade... eh
<Soarin> derpy pulled the plug
<Pattyrick> not overly
<Pattyrick> just a little more sour than sweet
<Elky> I don't even care
<Pattyrick> I do like Snapple's pink lemonade
<Purple`Prose> Oh Mythbusters, you so crazy
<WhatPayne> I guess what matters is that everything is okay now.
<Skylands> 10Never had it
<Elky> eeyup

<Soarin> haha
*Angel_Espeon wonders how it can still be called lemonade when it's raspberry o-o
<Soarin> fuckyeah <3
<Pattyrick> they're amazing

<Soarin> it can't be pathetic if you enjoy it
<Flutterpeanut> 13Love ya
<Flutterpeanut> 13<3

<MakotoNanaya> wait
<MakotoNanaya> is this Mythbusters?

<RainBroDash> As easy as that should be, I've never had to before :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8this show proves emphatically that edutainment is possible
<Aponymous> True dat
<Elky> I wouldn't talk of mythbusters as education
<Hipster_Brony> 8why not?

<Aurora> 6now my new college is requesting them from me, I have less than a week to get ahold of them, and this means i need to fly to LA next week
<Elky> I knew why I didn't quit the client...
<Kyu> 07fly?
<Kyu> 07you should roadtrip
<Aurora> 6yes
<Kyu> 07:'D
<Aurora> 6it wont be enough time

<Aurora> 6I literally do not have time for anything here
<Kyu> 07boo D:
<Purple`Prose> One of the best movies ever, coupled with one of the worst
<Guest8070519> Fucking fuck
<Aurora> 6they've already placed the hold on my account, I was supposed to register for classes next week
<Elky> and I haven't seen either one
<WhatPayne> And now I learned what a netsplit is...
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> Net split for great justice.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Isn't there a way you can tell them you need a bit more time or something?
<prince-dari> Hey Ghosties, head over to mod chat?
<Aurora> 6not really
<Ghosties> Okay
<Ghosties> So
<Ghosties> Question
<Aurora> 6universities have to deal with thousands and thousands of people
<Ghosties> When I input my password, did other people see it?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Ghosties> Okay, thank god
<prince-dari> So, I was thinking that all the mods could set up servers on the IRC network I've set up.
<Ghosties> SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING
<WhatPayne> Hello
<Purple`Prose> Boom
<EspyLacopa> Something
<Elky> SOMETHING
<Purple`Prose> Jamie want big boom
<prince-dari> So then we could share the work load.
<Somebody> Something
<prince-dari> It might be able to handle 300 people.
<Elky> you forgot the caps
<Ghosties> You'd have to talk to the other guys
<Somebody> Nah.
<prince-dari> Kind of hard when they aren't here.
<Somebody> My brain filters those things out.
<prince-dari> I'll get on skype I suppose.
<Ghosties> Well, this should be interesting
<Guest8070523> Who would give those two permission to RC a big military vehicle?
<Elky> I don't think I want to know

<Ghosties> Well, Sathi made it
<Elky> something like that espy
<Articuno> 12People can't take a joke, it's really annoying
<Sathi> looks like mibbit is having issues again
<Purple`Prose> Because Luna looks innocent. Adding cute, frilly socks just adds to it.
<HyperMetalLugia> What lamers? O.o
<Vinyer> 12lol
<Sathi> what did I do?
<Sathi> :)
<Articuno> 12What's the thing to check whether or not websites are down again?>
<WhatPayne> And the socks are pink!
<Purple`Prose> Indeed
<Shadow_Lugia> 6o.O
<HyperMetalLugia> !check www.lugia.us
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<Elky> pink? where?
<Articuno> 12thanks
<Vinyer> 12http://www.golamers.com/
<Vinyer> 12these people can take a joke though
<Elky> I've only seen blue ones iirc
<Purple`Prose> Not to mention how she's presented
<Articuno> 12ovO
<HyperMetalLugia> Wait, I think all bots are down
<Aurora> 6ocean is down
<HyperMetalLugia> Ouch :|
<Articuno> 12Does Google work for anyone here?!
<Aurora> 6yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes? XD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6The site? Yes.
<lightumbreon> 06yep
<Articuno> 12Ovo
<Articuno> 12So many sites are down for me >v<
<Articuno> 12I'm not sure whether there
<Articuno> 12Is a major problem or it's just my router
<Ghosties> You did nothing wrong
<Sathi> pfew I was worried for a moment
<Sathi> did this happen with mibbit before?
<Elky> just to make sure, are you still there?
<WhatPayne> I don't think I've seen Luna in blue socks.
<Articuno> 12ovO?
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'd come up with some elaborate metaphor for what I'm going to say next, but I can't think of any.
<Ghosties> No, I'm just confused about where the rest of the mods are
<HyperMetalLugia> It is sometimes better to keep things simple
<WhatPayne> I think I am...
<Sathi> well people cant connect atm, as the webclient cannot connect
<Sathi> i'm here via my own irc client
<Elky> good to hear
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, Arti, I've been polling the TST IRC community over a certain subject.
<Ghosties> With our current situation, mods are missing, the video is constantly buffering, and we have no means to effectively moderate people in the chat
<EspyLacopa> if Luna has kneesocks, who is Scanty?
<Ghosties> That I'm aware of
<Shadow_Lugia> 6That subject being DRF's continued moderatorship.
<Ghosties> I guess you can just simply use the same commands as always
<Aponymous> Finally figured out this mIRC thing.
<prince-dari> Well, why don't we just move the mibbit IRC to another server?
<Ghosties> *shrugs*
<prince-dari> I know one.
<Ghosties> I'm talking to Sprinkles and RainBroDash via Skype
<prince-dari> I could just register channels and stuff for temporary use?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6A majority of the people polled state 'yes' for him to be de-modded.
<WhatPayne> scanty & kneesocks?
<drfsupercenter> 03yay sleeping in until 3PM?
<Kyu> 07lol
<Skylands|GoD> 10loltiming
<HML-XD{GoD}> Epic timing
<Kyu> 07I slept in until noon, at least
<Hooh94807> 05Derp
<Shadow_Lugia> 6:>
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Purple`Prose> Celestia, of course
<Aurora> 6same as Kyu, I didn't expect to sleep that late though
<EspyLacopa> Kneesocks Luna vs Stocking Twilight.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ahem; Articuno?
<Elky> is the sound looping for you?
<Purple`Prose> yes
<EspyLacopa> Yes.
<Aponymous> Yup
<RandomExtra> Yes
<Elky> yes
<EspyLacopa> Meat the sandwich?
<Espeon> 06At least having XD in there in front of GoD makes it more difficult to take it out of context or read it as CoD :B
<prince-dari> What...
<prince-dari> The hell?
<Kyu> 07maybe she reset her router o3o
<EspyLacopa> They must be TF2 fans.
<Aponymous> Meet the Sanvich?
<Purple`Prose> sandvich
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Maybe.
<EspyLacopa> OMNOMNOM
<drfsupercenter> 03that or God :P
<Elky> and then it was offline
<WhatPayne> lol the stream derped
<HML-XD{GoD}> Oh you DRF :p
<Aurora> 6I think GLaDOS
<Aurora> 6for some reason
<Elky> everything is fucked up today
<Aponymous> It's Brony Appreciation day! Why is everything derping?
<Espeon> 06Well that's what I meant by taking it out of contest drf :P
<Espeon> 06But yes
<Shadow_Lugia> 6CamelCase.
<WhatPayne> Out of all possible days...
<EspyLacopa> Derpy's a pony too.
<HML-XD{GoD}> HumpBack Whale?
<Aponymous> It's back, thats good.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6There comes Ocean.
<HML-XD{GoD}> Cool story
<Kyu> 07woo
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<drfsupercenter> 03the VPS is still offlikne
<drfsupercenter> 03-k
<drfsupercenter> 03the one that ScriptBot is on
<drfsupercenter> 03which makes no sense LOL
<EspyLacopa> Derped again!
<Aurora> 6hmm, flights to LA will be about 175 for two people?
<EspyLacopa> .
<Elky> for how long though?
<EspyLacopa> lol
<WhatPayne> whoa
<EspyLacopa> It's a super derp.
<Aponymous> wut
<Ghosties> According to FlutterPeanut, mibbit is running
<Kyu> 07sounds a bit high o.o
<Elky> it is...
<Elky> for now
<Aurora> 6oh ouch
<Aurora> 6 175 for ONE person
<Aurora> 6one way
<Kyu> 07depends on the day I guess, but sometimes you can get them for....
<Kyu> 07OW
<Aurora> 6when did SJ/LA trips get that ridiculous
<Sathi> hmm
<Kyu> 07WTF
<drfsupercenter> 03can't you just drive?
<Aurora> 6they've NEVER been that high
<Aurora> 6god i think maybe we will drive
<Kyu> 07take amtrak
<Kyu> 07:'D
<Aurora> 6I really don't want to, but ugh
<Kyu> 07who's going with you?
<Aurora> 6my dad
<prince-dari> Ok.
<drfsupercenter> 03what's happening in LA?
<prince-dari> I relocated the server, no net splits.
<Aurora> 6the reason we probably wont drive is because he'd be driving
<Ghosties> I'm not registered supposedly
<prince-dari> Yeah, different server Ghosties.
<Aurora> 6drf, my old college screwed me over with my new one
<Aurora> 6and didn't send my transcripts
<May> 14What?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<May> 14Wow
<May> 14Just wow
<Sathi> .
<May> 14That really really must suck
<Elky> .
<Ghosties> Wellllllll
<Aurora> 6the only way to get them delivered in time (and to be sure they actually GET THERE), I'm going to deliver it in person
<Aponymous> ?
<Aurora> 6um yeah
<Elky> seems like the webchat is still separate
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Kyu> 07can't you send a fax or an email or something?
<Kyu> 07like
<WhatPayne> hm?
<Kyu> 07while you're on the phone with them lol
<May> 14My school sent my transcripts, but decided to give me all Fs because I was only there for about two weeks
<WhatPayne> so it seems
<May> 14It took a lot of butt hauling to get those grades up
<Aurora> 6no
<EspyLacopa> Derp!
<May> 14Yeah, why wouldn't you be able to fax the transcripts or email them?
<Aurora> 6the transcripts MUST be paper, in person, etc
<Aurora> 6that's how transfering works
<drfsupercenter> 03policies are dumb
<Aurora> 6they are
<May> 14well, when's the deadling?
<May> 14*deadline?
<Aurora> 6july 8th
<Aurora> 6:|
<May> 14to get it there for school?
<Aurora> 6as of now, a hold is on my account
<Aurora> 6I can't register for classes
<May> 14holy friggin crap
<Aurora> 6and registering for classes is next friday
<May> 14Well
<Aurora> 6I can get the flight easily
<Aurora> 6it's the fact that it takes time to process the request form..
<May> 14I'll tell you what. Get a car with good gas mileage, gas money, and money to rent a hotel or whatever
<Aurora> 6and my old college closes its office fridays at noon
<Aurora> 6if i hadn't woken up as late as I did
<drfsupercenter> 03well, I think why they require it to be in person is so that you can't forge it
<Aurora> 6may, we have a prius, and we don't need a hotel
<drfsupercenter> 03as in, I've forged rebate forms before by opening the pdf file in something and editing it XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and if you were to fax it
<drfsupercenter> 03theoretically you could scan it and change Bs to As, etc
<May> 14well, whatever floats your boat
<Aurora> 6but my dad doesn't want to do the 6 hour drive twice in a month
<May> 14I'd sleep in the car actually
<Kyu> 07when are you going?
<Aurora> 6wednesday probably
<May> 14Well, why can't you drive?
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6company car
<Aurora> 6so I'm not allowed to drive it
<WhatPayne> this is derpiest day thus far I've seen.
<Aurora> 6otherwise I would
<Kyu> 07you could try priceline lol
<Aponymous> So many derps.
<Aurora> 6true
<drfsupercenter> 03but make sure you get to talk to Shatner himself :D
*drfsupercenter runs
<May> 14and what happened to your car?
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o @ this email
<drfsupercenter> 03Next Spring, join a new kind of hero and embark on a journey the whole family
<drfsupercenter> 03will enjoy in Disneys JOHN CARTER. Watch the newly released trailer now
<drfsupercenter> 03and discover the hero, the world and the action-filled fun that awaits when
<drfsupercenter> 03JOHN CARTER arrives in theaters March 2012.
<May> 14plus, I really didn't think it took that long to deliver some papers to your school from Hollister
<Armada_OfDeath> hello bronies

<Aurora> 6I am taking those papers
<Aurora> 6in my hands
<Aponymous> Hi
<May> 14then send it yourself?
<Aurora> 6to fullerton
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Aurora> 6if I have to murder someone on the way I will, those papers are getting to fullerton
<May> 14okay well, I know I can get a good size package to the otherside of the country overnight, but that's airmail
<May> 14and it's expensive
<Aurora> 6I'm not doing post
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not that expensive
<Aurora> 6I don't trust it right now
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like 20 bucks
<May> 14well
<May> 14yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03to do USPS express mail
<drfsupercenter> 03that's cheaper than gas
<WhatPayne> finally
<Aurora> 6I'm not doing post because i don't trust it right now
<Kyu> 07well
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL

<Aponymous> Hello
<Kyu> 07....
<Kyu> 07-_-
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL people not reading

<Toty> What time is it in your area?
<Guyandsam> 1:33

<WhatPayne> let's
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought you had your own car?
<Aurora> 6ok...story in short: my dad and I are going to LA to deliver my transcripts in person, we have one week to do so
*May OTL
<RainbowLoon> good evening everyone
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6I also said why we're not taking my car
<Flutterpeanut> Wait
<Flutterpeanut> I got recognized.
<Aurora> 6 12:30	Aurora	my car wont make this trip many times
<May> 14drf, you should read
<Elky2> let's?
<Flutterpeanut> 13So.
<Toty> jeez....1:33 it's already 9:33 pm here
<Aurora> 6ok well
<WhatPayne> let's hope that
<Aurora> 6I'm just gonna stop talking about this
<Asmalya> here too
<Elky2> oh, yes.
<prince-dari> Everyone here, refresh the page.
<drfsupercenter> 03<Aurora> ok...story in short: my dad and I are going to LA to deliver my transcripts in person, we have one week to do so <- Sounds like a plot for a movie
<RainbowLoon> same here
*drfsupercenter hides
<Aponymous> Its only 3:34 PM here
<Aurora> 6I don't even know why this turned into the topic of conversation in here
<Elky2> aye
<fireheart3> ns register
<May> 14<Aurora> but my dad doesn't want to do the 6 hour drive twice in a month <-- but he is anyway, right?
<Sathi> reloading
<fireheart3> ok i will figure this out.
<May> 14he just doesn't want to
<Rezo-chan> the / is important.
<HML-XD{GoD}> Because we care about your education? o.o
<HML-XD{GoD}> XD
<RainbowLoon> hmm, is there a way to detach the chat window? it won't fit on my screen together with the video
<May> 14<drfsupercenter> <Aurora> ok...story in short: my dad and I are going to LA to deliver my transcripts in person, we have one week to do so <- Sounds like a plot for a movie <-- It's call Due Date
<Aurora> 6I was just talking about FLYING, because he doesnt want to do the drive twice
<Flutterpeanut> Oh come on.
<Elky> why refresh though?
<Aurora> 6so no, he isn't going to
<Aurora> 6*drive
<May> 14it's cheaper to drive, rather than fly
<May> 14my opinions
<fireheart3> Huzzah
<Aurora> 6doesnt
<Aurora> 6want
<Aurora> 6to drive
<lightumbreon> 06train
<Rezo-chan> Just type /ns register <your password> <Your email>, then the network sends you an email with the confirmation code (Because it likes to make things needlessly difficult), you enter that code, and you're registered
<Toty> You could open a second window with the stream only with the sound muted or something
<lightumbreon> 06what about the train
<Aurora> 6I'm done talking
<Purple`Prose> I love Mythbusters
<May> 14Yeah, true
<Aurora> 6since I didn't mean for my personal life to be this big of a deal lol
*Shadow_Lugia 6awaits Guest7647.
<May> 14the train is cheaper also
<fireheart3> Yep figured it out. I just used help XD
<Rezo-chan> Oh
<WhatPayne> Who would not love MB?
<Rezo-chan> Wlel, at least I got some typing experience
<fireheart3> teehee
<prince-dari> Anyone here who is not using the mibbit on the theatre page?
<Flutterpeanut> 13ALright well.
<Rezo-chan> Well, if you saw the butchered german version...
<prince-dari> Anyone here who is not using the mibbit on the theatre page?
<Purple`Prose> Me
<WhatPayne> Me
<prince-dari> Go to irc.epic-chat.net
<prince-dari> Same channel name.
<drfsupercenter> 03<Aurora> since I didn't mean for my personal life to be this big of a deal lol <- you would fail as a celebrity then :P
<Rezo-chan> huh. It's no longer on irchighway?
<Elky> now I'm intrigued
<HML-XD{GoD}> Aurora is kinda celebrity to us, but hehe
<prince-dari> We're moving for the moment because this place is being unreliable.
<Aponymous> So thats why the chats were seperate.
<HML-XD{GoD}> +a
<Rezo-chan> Oh.
<prince-dari> No it's not.
<Flutterpeanut> 13Ah. Hm.
<May> 14lol drf
<prince-dari> That's because of the net split.
<Elky> smart.
<prince-dari> I just changed the location of the server on the theatre page.
<Kyu> 07the difference being celebrities don't need to talk to their fans about their personal lives lol
<prince-dari> So anyone on the mibbit there, refresh and go on again.
<Dialga> is ocean having trouble or something
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yep.
<Dialga> k
<RainbowLoon> ok, found a workaround - in full screen mode it will fit next to each other. good enough for when things go real :)
<May> 14this is also true
<Elky> we have to register the nicknames again?
<Aurora> 6oh yeah, kyu, delta airlines (looking at priceline) for the same exact thing: 318
<fireheart3> Okey dokey loki
<Elky> brb registering mod names
<Elky> and tacowiz
<Kyu> 07for both, round trip right
<Aurora> 6yeah

<fireheart3> DX this is not liking me.
<Kyu> 07southwest airlines
<Aurora> 6remember the first price I gave you?
<Aurora> 6that was southwest

<Elky> fireheart: if you want, type /ns help
*Rezo-chan is mildly confused now, but meh
<Elky> now back to physics
<Elky> the two trucks crashing isn't equivalent to a single truck crashing against a wall at 100 mph
<Aurora> 6yes
<drfsupercenter> 03home of all the rappers?
<Elky> because now there are two trucks absorbing the energy of the impact
<drfsupercenter> 03I swear I hear LAX mentioned in lots of rap songs XD
<Elky> [/nerd]
<Aurora> 6why would an airport be in a ton of rap songs?
<Purple`Prose> They did an episode on that
<May> 14when will you be flying?
*Vinyer vinyer's all over kyu

<MrPoniator> Two hours till the movie?
<MrPoniator> or wait
<Rezo-chan> three I think
<Elky> three if I'm right
<Purple`Prose> 2 hours until preshow
<Rezo-chan> They usually start just when I go to bed.
<May> 14which airport are you leaving from, roara?
<Elky> preshow is now
<MrPoniator> The timer shows 2:14 for me
<Elky> but yeah, two hours until ponies
<MrPoniator> 2:11*
<Dee_Twenty> There's another showing tomorrow that starts about an hour ago for you Eurobronies, Rezo-chan.
<WhatPayne> When you usually go bed?
<Aponymous> Pony pilots at 6, then main attractions at 7
<Elky> yeah, we're watching the pilot episodes before the movies today
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZJW-rkVKFE
<MrPoniator> Ok
<drfsupercenter> 03this one for example
<Rezo-chan> Yah, but I'm used to fridays ^^
<Purple`Prose> Happy Brony Appreciation Day
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: T.I. What You Know (Official Video) | by realrapback | Length: | Views: 322 379
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL lag
<MrPoniator> What movie is it, then? (Sorry, too lazy to check, since I'm lazy today)
<Kyu> 07LOL T.I.
<Purple`Prose> The Godfather and Battlefield Earth
<Aponymous> I just realized Brony Appreciation Day is abbreviated to BAD
<MrPoniator> Lol
<Ghosties> 4IT WORKS
<Dee_Twenty> Cupcake wine is not a good way to celebrate Brony Appreciation Day, like drinking pure ethanol. No wonder it's $9 a bottle.
<Elky> YES
<MrPoniator> And huh, it's been a while since I saw the Godfather
<Elky> cupcake wine?
<Elky> wtf am I reading?
<drfsupercenter> 03ew, they put the dirty version of the song over the real one :/
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03the intro mentions it
<WhatPayne> This is one of my favorite MB moments.
<drfsupercenter> 03and I swear I've heard it other places too, can't remember where offhand
<Purple`Prose> The annihilation of the car
<Dee_Twenty> It's a brand of cheap wine called Cupcake Vineyards, it tastes as horrid as you'd expect from $9 wine. XD
<fireheart3> I've never seen the godfather.
<Elky> tbh I'm used to drinking 4$ wine
<Aponymous> $9 Wine? that sound apealling in exactly 0 ways.

<Aponymous> Which reminds me, I have a bottle of champagne.

<Dee_Twenty> Does anypony else see the irony in watching a movie with a decapitated horse head on Brony Appreciation Day? XD
<Rezo-chan> lol
<HML-XD{GoD}> Our airport is kinda low-tech and basic with everythin </random>L

<HML-XD{GoD}> So horray security
<Elky> couldn't you just do the math?
*Vinyer vinyer's all over SilverSonic
<MrPoniator> I wonder if I'll be able to pull through, since I'm already feeling lazy and tired

<RandomExtra> Yes it was
<Rezo-chan> Awww. B movie comes second tonight? :(
<drfsupercenter> 0342
<MrPoniator> Maybe in small doses, but I wouldn't drink any energy drinks for that matter
<drfsupercenter> 03the answer to life, the universe, and everything
<HML-XD{GoD}> Humidity, rain and everything
<Elky> in that case, you might be stuck with not being able to stay awake
<MrPoniator> True dat
<Elky> but you could also drink ice cold water
<fireheart3> Ummmm doesn't the B move always come second. That's why it's called a B move
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Elky> it might work...
<drfsupercenter> 03Best thing I've heard all day
<MrPoniator> Better play something to stimulate my brains not to fall asleep
<Elky> fire: the schedule is randomized
<HML-XD{GoD}> Hmm?
<Dee_Twenty> Dee_Twenty looks at the 24 ounce energy drink in his hand.
<Rezo-chan> B movie came first the past two or three weeks
<Aponymous> The B movie is the bad one, the A movie is the good one.
<HML-XD{GoD}> Ohai Maybur
<fireheart3> Yep double feature.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Meep, Draelen.
<fireheart3> Sorry i just thought it was funny.
<WhatPayne> 0,75 liter canister of caffeninated drink on hand.
<Sathi> 7no worries
<Toty> A and B movies are not sorted by how good/bad a movie is but by their budget
<MrPoniator> So wait, Battlefield Earth?
<Espeon> 06Mays
<Purple`Prose> yep
<Shadow_Lugia> 6You are playing -, Espy?

<fireheart3> I can't wait to see godfather for the first time.
<MrPoniator> Well, okay
<WhatPayne> best part
<sammywii> Can't wait to see Battlefield Earth. heard it was hilarious.
<Excalibur> 14eh
<Purple`Prose> and the car went poof
<MrPoniator> The only time I had motion sickness outside of car and boat trips was playing Perfect Dark as a kid
<Elky> fire: dunno if bmn is the best way to watch a great movie when you haven'T seen it before
*Rezo-chan hasn't seen any of the films tonight. Isn't sure whetehr that's good or bad
<Excalibur> 14someone kill May
<DSNesmith> BE is amazing
<MrPoniator> So let's see about the camera tilting
<WhatPayne> Seriously that rocket sled is effin awesome
<Shadow_Lugia> 6'Jesp is now playing -'.
<Aponymous> I'll have my head tilted throughout Battlefield Earth
<DSNesmith> the dialogue is impossibly bad
*HML-XD{GoD} kills May
<Elky> but I haven't seen it either and don't care
<HML-XD{GoD}> Better/
<DSNesmith> the tongue scene
<Hipster_Brony> 8HOW HAVE PEOPLE NOT SEEN THE GODFATHER?!

<fireheart3> I'm young so i haven't seen it yet.
<Ghosties> 4I saw it in high school, Hipster
<Aponymous> *Wants a rocket sled*
<MrPoniator> Well, Hipster, I've seen it, but I barely remember it anymore
<RainBroDash> 10mad, hipster?
<Rezo-chan> By not being overly interested in the gangster film genre
<sammywii> Me neither.
<Toty> I also have not seen it
<Excalibur> 14>>
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> ?
<Elky> I JUST NEVER GOT AROUND
<Dee_Twenty> If you want to prepare your anus for Battlefield Earth you might want to check out the Nostalgia Critic's review.
<HML-XD{GoD}> Well, she's already dead
<HML-XD{GoD}> :<
<DSNesmith> spiiiiderssss
<WhatPayne> Man-animal!
*Rezo-chan wasn't overly impressed by whatsitsname... the one playing in Miami and covering cubans, either
<Excalibur> 14I guess I can ghostkill
<MrPoniator> Oh wait, NC did a review on it?
<Excalibur> 14it won't let me
<HML-XD{GoD}> try to ghost?
<DSNesmith> yeah
<HML-XD{GoD}> :<
<HML-XD{GoD}> Bawww
<DSNesmith> it's a good one too
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> yup
<MrPoniator> Huh, can't remember it, then
<sammywii> Already seen NC's review of BE.
<Aponymous> Spoony stole the show on that one
*Ghosties 4doesn't watch Nostalgia Critic
<DSNesmith> wow, that car just dissolved
<WhatPayne> Nostalgia Critic did the review with Spoony as cameo
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> ive actually never seen BE, just the NC review of it
<Dee_Twenty> Ghosties has no taste. :p
<Excalibur> 14fffffff I hate this
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont like nostalgia critic
<MrPoniator> I can remember the spoony (and Linkara) cameos, but I can't remember the movie itself
<Hipster_Brony> 8he tries too hard
<DSNesmith> NC's getting into the fan circuit a bit much now
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> whos actually seen the full BE movie?
<DSNesmith> but he's still funny
<Dee_Twenty> I have.
<DSNesmith> I've seen... most of it
<DSNesmith> couldn't finish
<MrPoniator> I watch NC whenever I'm bored
<WhatPayne> I thing NC has become stale as well... But Cinemasnob is super awesome
<DSNesmith> wasn't nearly drunk enough to sit through two hours of Travolta being... travolting
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> MrPoniator: me too
<MrPoniator> Guess I could check out this week's review while waiting or so
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> milk money review was awesome
<fireheart3> I think they over did it. They need it to go slower.
<Elky> the only travolta movie I've ever seen is pulp fiction
<Kyu> 07weeeeird
<Elky> so, no idea what he'S like
<DSNesmith> travolta's one of those weird actors
<WhatPayne> Not Swordfish?
<DSNesmith> he has good movies
<DSNesmith> like PF
<fireheart3> Pulp fiction is a great movie.
<MrPoniator> Welp, I guess I'll go watch that review now, then
<DSNesmith> and Face/Off
<Purple`Prose> SCIENCE!!!
<MrPoniator> Gonna grab myself some soda while on it
<DSNesmith> and then he's got Hairspray
<DSNesmith> and BE
<Ghosties> 4Ah, good
<Excalibur> 14Yeah
<Excalibur> 14sure is
<Ghosties> 4You got in fine, Dee_Twenty?
<DSNesmith> kinda like Nic Cage
<Elky> why is that, does he just take every role he gets offered?
<Rezo-chan> Travolta's movies are great every time he's not in charge of actually making it
<DSNesmith> dunno
<Elky> like chris walken?
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> does the movie night/day start in 2 hours?
<DSNesmith> I think Cage takes only the best and worst movies he's offered
<DSNesmith> his best are okay
<DSNesmith> the Rock
<WhatPayne> Nick Cage is awesome. I guess the BMN acknowledges that?
<Vinyer> 12i can't think
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes, mare

<Rezo-chan> Oh. Must've missed it.
<Rezo-chan> Alas :(
<Dee_Twenty> Somepony needs to dub over the scene from Call of the Cutie with the burned cupcakes with that dialogue.
<DSNesmith> have you seent he one with Twilight, spike, and the book?
<DSNesmith> someone dubbed the dialogue over
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> have we already seen the room?
<WhatPayne> Ho'd get burned?
<Rezo-chan> Yes.
<Dee_Twenty> Yep.
<Elky> I'm still wondering if I should choose a western movie again if I get chosen for a movie
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I like the decimal when you divide 1 by 243 or 81.
<DSNesmith> hah
<Aponymous> Someone did with the scene where Twilight finds the book Spike burned in Owls Well that Ends Well
<Rezo-chan> Pick one of the Bud Spencer/ Terence Hill westerns, hee.

<Shadow_Lugia> 6It has to be longer.
<DSNesmith> oh, what's the one western
<Shadow_Lugia> 6It has to be much longer.
<Elky> apon, I picked a fistful of dollars

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Indeed.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, Elky picked a good film
<Dee_Twenty> DSNesmith just described pretty much every Western ever made.
<fireheart3> I can't keep up with chat so i'll just watch the show.

<Rezo-chan> err.
<Rezo-chan> BMN
<HML-XD{GoD}> oh

<sammywii> YES! Reb Brown would be awesome!
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> wtf are they doing on mythbusters?
<Ghosties> yay
<DSNesmith> I'd suggest Manos, but without the MST3K guys that'd be unbearable
<Rezo-chan> Dropping cars
<Purple`Prose> how about a Terry Gilliam film?
<HML-XD{GoD}> @calc 1/1
<junh1024-XD> = 1

<Rezo-chan> The 1942 Munchhausen?
<Rezo-chan> WOuld be neat
<Ghosties> 4I know
<DSNesmith> no, the imaginarium
<Aponymous> ED2 and Holy Grail was my first BMN.
<Ghosties> 4How about a Uwe Boll film?
<DSNesmith> ugh
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> look at all that coke
<Elky> ugh
<Purple`Prose> or my favorite, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

<HML-XD{GoD}> :p
<Elky> uwe boll
<Dee_Twenty> KILL IT WITH FIRE!
<Sathi> 7no it was not
*Rezo-chan would rather watch Uwe Boll than John Ford, but admittedly, that's to do with how much he detests John Wayne.
<DSNesmith> de 'greatest fucking genius in de whole fucking beezness'
<fireheart3> yay more boom.
<HaxBrony> no

<Aponymous> Spiders Web WAS fun, if you're a masochist.
<Rezo-chan> Spiders Web was someone torlling this channel :(
<HML-XD{GoD}> DRF is my hero
<Pyrate> Hipster, tell me you still have it.
*HML-XD{GoD} goes back to GC

<Hipster_Brony> 8i do
<HaxBrony> the deal with it pig lol
<sammywii> I keep hearing about this TacoWiz guy. What exactly did he/she do on here?
<fireheart3> That's all pig
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> BUSTED
<HML-XD{GoD}> Also: Someone needs to make a linux cluster out of Wiis
<DSNesmith> awww
<Pyrate> Who's Tacowiz?
<Dee_Twenty> He chose Spider's Web.
<SirSprinkles> 6We don't talk about TacoWiz
<Aponymous> On a brighter note, I increased my bacon consumption after Spiders Web.
<RandomExtra> He sugessted the pig movie
<Pyrate> Ohohohoho.
<Hipster_Brony> 8he made us watch the worst movie ever
<HaxBrony> lo
<Pyrate> The biggest troll.
<SirSprinkles> 6Spider's Web doesn't exist.
<HaxBrony> lol, he trolled us
<Elky> he chose Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale for B movie
<DSNesmith> they should try this Mythbusting with trains
<Elky> which is, like the worst movie ever
<DSNesmith> lol
<DSNesmith> Mockbusters
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> wats spiders web about?
<drfsupercenter> 03It's probably been done
<DSNesmith> we should watch Transmorphers
<Elky> about a pig
<sammywii> Never seen it. Maybe I should be glad I wasn't here.
<Ghosties> 4Hmm...an earlier post made in here lets me know what I'm picking
<drfsupercenter> 03I know the US government has a linux cluster of PS3s :P
<Rezo-chan> It makes Uwe Boll look like Oscar-winning genius
<Sathi> 7spiders, pigs and snakes
<Ghosties> 4If I get A movie
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://i.imgur.com/neWcB.gif
<DSNesmith> oooooor, for bad-movie awfulness
<DSNesmith> Video Brinquedo
<fireheart3> I think we should watch army of darkness.
<Dee_Twenty> It's an even MORE painfully boring version of Charlotte's Web.
<HML-XD{GoD}> The only good thing about the PS3 is the hardware
<DSNesmith> Ratatoing
<HML-XD{GoD}> Well
<HaxBrony> whats the B- movie tonight?
<HML-XD{GoD}> Old hardware
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> DSNesmith: transmorphers or snakes on a train

<drfsupercenter> 03as I will admit it's one of the best Blu-Ray players ever.
<Dee_Twenty> Does Transmorphers count as a B movie when it's actually BETTER than the movies they're ripping off?
<MrPoniator> Since I never heard about it before that point
<Elky> it's much less painful watching it with others
<drfsupercenter> 03that and upscaling DVDs.
<Rezo-chan> It is?
<DSNesmith> apparently Transmorphers actually rips off the Terminator more than the TFs
<prince-dari> From what I've heard I avoided years of sleepless nights Elky. :P
<Elky> hm...
<DSNesmith> oh, there was this one movie
<DSNesmith> Komodo vs. Giant Kobra
<DSNesmith> that one was amazing
<Elky> well, all of us have a goal in life now: hunt down the guys who made it
<howequestriawasmade> still playing the myth buster stuff i see
<fireheart3> wanna see this crash
<Dee_Twenty> If I get picked for either movie we're watching some fucking Godzilla, the GOOD Godzilla, not the shitty American knockoff.
<Rezo-chan> I have to say ONE good thi9ng about Spider's Web.
<HaxBrony> lol holy shit
<Rezo-chan> It didn't depict the spiders as the bad guys.
<HML-XD{GoD}> I refuse to use HDMI for any HD product
<Elky> I hope we get drunk cooking
*Rezo-chan likes spiders
<HML-XD{GoD}> Just because I like Component so much
<MrPoniator> God freakin' damnit
<Elky> also, the pig's rap was pretty fun
<DSNesmith> oh, have we seen Shark Attack 3: Megalodon
<HaxBrony> hahaha
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> can we watch gordy
<MrPoniator> I'm laughing at the stupidity of Milk Money, now that I'm watching the NC review
<Aponymous> No, but we NEED to

<DSNesmith> "what'dyou say I take you home and... eat your pussy?"
<Dee_Twenty> I hate pig movies, they make me hungry.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> the milk money review is awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03I used to use component, until I got my surround sound receiver.
<Ghosties> 4Oh, trust me, Tacowiz has our ire

<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> BABE pig in the city is best pig movie
<Aurora> 6?

<DSNesmith> about the pig that takes over a company
<HaxBrony> hes just bein a gilda.
<Elky> implying pig movies can be good
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> gordy
<fireheart3> Pig movies make me want to eat more bacon.

<DSNesmith> the Rap
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Just to forewarn.
<HML-XD{GoD}> I just like how you can use a component cable into a AV or vice-versa
<Dee_Twenty> That's like being the best Uwe Boll movie, the bar's not set very high.

<DSNesmith> I love how this review takes a dark turn on the THIRD LINE
<Pattyrick> LOL

<HaxBrony> ಠ_ಠ
<Dee_Twenty> AdBlock+ is best pony.
<Pattyrick> it'd run iOS 5
<DSNesmith> wow
<HaxBrony> lol ^^
<DSNesmith> charming
<HML-XD{GoD}> Nah
<HML-XD{GoD}> It'd run Android
<DSNesmith> they should have read the book
<HaxBrony> uh oh.
<HML-XD{GoD}> Then it'll be complete :D
<NightSeas> 12Actually, the OS that comes with the wii is already a lot like a mac
<MrPoniator> I can't even wonder what the makers of this movie were on
<Rezo-chan> ...
<Rezo-chan> wtf
<HML-XD{GoD}> Just because it is silver?
<DSNesmith> 0.o
<Barbaloot> What movie is he reviewing?
<HaxBrony> dafuqs this
<MrPoniator> Milk Money
<sammywii> Milk Money.
<Dee_Twenty> Milk Money.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> lol these kids are clueless
<DSNesmith> looks like a boob?
<MrPoniator> It's this week's review
<DSNesmith> grade a dialogue there
<Dee_Twenty> It's the movie where a kid brings a hooker to school for show and tell.
<Aponymous> ED HARRIS!?
<DSNesmith> sex ed... in elementary school?
<MrPoniator> Shouldn't we watch this instead of Battlefield Earth? \(:D)/
<HaxBrony> lol.
<WhatPayne> Milk Money is so creepy!
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> aw lag
<Rezo-chan> This does creep me out.
<Pattyrick> no
<Pattyrick> because of its large icons
<Pattyrick> imagine what the Wii U tablet would be like with iOS on it...
<DSNesmith> this movie is veering straight into wtfery
<DSNesmith> WHAT
<drfsupercenter> 03it would suck
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<HaxBrony> dayum
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Most schools in the UK start sex ed in last year of elementry school. Dunno about the US
<MrPoniator> Porn, indeed so
<DSNesmith> random ass shot
<HML-XD{GoD}> Well
<HML-XD{GoD}> See
<HaveTubaWillTravel> And hi everypony. Happy Brony Day
<HML-XD{GoD}> There are many issues
<MrPoniator> Hey brony
<HML-XD{GoD}> As...the tablet is just a screen
<DSNesmith> okay what these kids are like 12
<DSNesmith> sup tuba
<HML-XD{GoD}> So it cant run iOS
<Pattyrick> iOS
<Aponymous> Happy BAD
<HaxBrony> wasup
<Pattyrick> yes it can
<HML-XD{GoD}> The Wii U *might*
<DSNesmith> lol full house
<Rezo-chan> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Pattyrick> forgive me for using these foul device names, drf
<Purple`Prose> ...oh sweet Luna
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Best abbreviation ever
<Dee_Twenty> Always hated Full House.
<DSNesmith> all the tiiiime
<DSNesmith> Equestria
<HML-XD{GoD}> Whee
<Pattyrick> but the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch all are just screens with a few buttons
<DSNesmith> they dont' wear clothes
<Rezo-chan> Terrible 80s and 90s comedy references :(
<HML-XD{GoD}> Deathly hollows are on sunday
<HML-XD{GoD}> Yay me
<drfsupercenter> 03try ONE button
<MrPoniator> Well, the first time I happened to see porn was when I was 12. I was in a hotel room, and then I turn on the TV. Suddenly, porn at 3PM or so
<HML-XD{GoD}> LOL
<DSNesmith> wow, did they ACTUALLY break a piggy bank on camera?
<HaxBrony> kill the pig.
<HaxBrony> make tacowiz watch
<HML-XD{GoD}> Volume buttons don't count
<SilverSonic> flk;ajdfk;sdj
<HML-XD{GoD}> Sadly :p
<SilverSonic> Who highlighted me
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> hot
<Pattyrick> home button, lock button, volume buttons
<NightSeas> 12It only needs one button though :p
<DSNesmith> this is the charming, heartwarming coming of age story
<Pattyrick> and, on iPad and iPhone, silence/lock rotation button
<WhatPayne> No gurl ever paid to wear my jacket
<Dee_Twenty> The makers went forward in time and saw Spider's Web.
<DSNesmith> of three boys and their quest to buy a hooker
<drfsupercenter> 03lock SWITCH
<drfsupercenter> 03not button
<Pattyrick> yup
<MrPoniator> I always killed my piggy banks, because I lost the keys
<SirSprinkles> 6MILK IT
<RainbowLoon> whan i was that age there was no internet full of pr0n and we wasn't nearly as clueless as those kids :P
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> ?
<fireheart3> adblocker you need it.
<Pattyrick> true
<Pattyrick> still, the others are buttons
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but Android devices have a lot more button.
<HML-XD{GoD}> Do they do anything with the menus?
<SirSprinkles> 6DAT MASSIVE CHATLAG
<drfsupercenter> 03*buttons
<Pattyrick> not really
<DSNesmith> commendably dumb
*Rezo-chan did see his first porn flicks at twelve or thirteen. Did it in a much less awkward fashion than THIS, though
<DSNesmith> I like that turn of phrase
<MrPoniator> "Are you prostitute?" the best pick up line ever
<HaxBrony> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03yes really.
<Pattyrick> the volume buttons control, well, volume
<DSNesmith> YOU GUYS NEED SOME HELP?
<Barbaloot> HEY MR. HAXBRONY
<Pattyrick> or, Android
<Pattyrick> my mistake
<Barbaloot> ARE YOU A PROSTITUTE?
<DSNesmith> that guy looks legit
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> THIS GUY LOOKS LEGIT!!
<lightumbreon> 06i'm off to bed
<HML-XD{GoD}> Hello keyboards
<lightumbreon> 06Gnite all
<HML-XD{GoD}> Night LU <
<Zecora> next movie
<HML-XD{GoD}> :<
<HaxBrony> only on weekends.
*HML-XD{GoD} hugs
<NightSeas> 12Night
*lightumbreon is squished by a BIG lugia
<sammywii> I completely trust this guy.
<MrPoniator> How the heck does that work?
<DSNesmith> those heels
<DSNesmith> ....
<DSNesmith> this movie
<lightumbreon> 06Gnite
<DSNesmith> why does this exist
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway bbl
<HML-XD{GoD}> And let's just face it: The Wii U will NOT have any other OS on it, Linux is the closest thing
<Barbaloot> Because Hollywood
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> needs money
<Rezo-chan> Seriously, though. What does an ostensibly ten-year old looking boy do in a film like this?
<MrPoniator> Well, it's not Serbian Movie
<Dee_Twenty> If they really want a prostitute they should just give Paris Hilton a call, she's cheaper.
<DSNesmith> Serbian movie doesn't exist
<DSNesmith> wait what the kids are flashing
<NightSeas> 12However, Android makes apple suck
<DSNesmith> and what the fuck is that music
<Cynder7> 6I see you is playing Portal 2..
<drf|away> 03^
<MrPoniator> It's the pedo music
<HaxBrony> lol.
<Pattyrick> goodnight lu =D
<Aponymous> What
<HaxBrony> pedobear seal of approval.
<DSNesmith> nice red lighting
<Aponymous> What
<HML-XD{GoD}> I wonder if the Amazon Tablet will run android
<Rezo-chan> This is terrible.
<DSNesmith> this
<DSNesmith> what
<HML-XD{GoD}> If they ever release it
<Rezo-chan> And I remember seeing adds for this on TV
<MrPoniator> How delightful
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> this movie never needed to exist
<Barbaloot> >Cigarettes
<DSNesmith> watching George Clooney eat out a random italian woman in 'The American' was less awkward than this
<MrPoniator> I wanna know how they advertized this
<Pattyrick> tbh, Android is a good operating system
<sammywii> This is very weird.... Glad I never seen this movie.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> lol
<Rezo-chan> Actually...
<DSNesmith> cause hookers borrow their pimps' cars all the time
<Rezo-chan> ... with pretty much the same scenes you see in this review
<MrPoniator> Well behaved, yeah, right
<Dee_Twenty> DSNesmith >Implying that anypony in the American was a human and not a cardboard cutout.
<SirSprinkles> 6So... what's everypony think of posting as a mod rainbow of "HAPPY BRONY APPRECIATION DAY!"?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> god dang the chronicler is creepy
<NightSeas> 12[14:43] <HML-XD{GoD}> I wonder if the Amazon Tablet will run android <-- It probably will since almost everyone that’s not Apple runs Android
<DSNesmith> awkward hand shaking
<Rezo-chan> "Hello, I'M a slut, and your son has seen me naked. You wanna fuck me?"
<Hipster_Brony> we have to coordinate this
<DSNesmith> math tutor?
<Aponymous> Did that kid get Ed Harris a prostitute?
<RainbowLoon> Hooker Anny! - Mister Naughty!
<HaxBrony> tgi fridays, gtfo
<DSNesmith> "kid, that's your mother!"
<Hipster_Brony> and do it after annuncements
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is why I'm bringing it up now.
<RainbowLoon> "oh, you know each other"
<DSNesmith> WHAT
<DSNesmith> DID THEY
<HaxBrony> LOL
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> ha
<DSNesmith> they just went there
<fireheart3> HAHA
<Dee_Twenty> I never even knew there were ads on TGWTG, Firefox is love.
<SirSprinkles> 6It would be in color order, and dari would end it with his rainbow writing.
<NightSeas> 12Hopefully it won't be windows
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> win
<Icy> I know
<MrPoniator> Bye bye, enjoy hell
<DSNesmith> wooooow
<Dee_Twenty> But I don't want Milk Money in Florida.
<MrPoniator> Those girls
<Hipster_Brony> ok, so 6 people, right?
<prince-dari> We need all the mods here to start with though.
<DSNesmith> so she goes to random suburbia
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> is that toy story music?
<Rezo-chan> >Chick not changing her dress for a week
<DSNesmith> and... plys her trade
<Barbaloot> dose gurls
*Sathi waves
<Barbaloot> Stop looking at her like that
<DSNesmith> that was bad *derpface*
<SirSprinkles> 6We're missing DCD and Silver. *shrug*
<MrPoniator> Very, very, very bad
<HaxBrony> girls are so judgemental
<Hipster_Brony> okay.jpg
<HaxBrony> gawd.
<Pattyrick> =|
<DSNesmith> she spoke to meeee
<NightSeas> 12However, Amazon might make their own OS
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> having an entrance to mt. malefor
<Hipster_Brony> well, we can change around the colors
<DSNesmith> I'm his aunt
<SirSprinkles> 6We can still do it if they're not here though.
<sammywii> "I can hear you, you twerp."
<MrPoniator> Awkward smile.jpg
<DSNesmith> he's seen my tits
<Hipster_Brony> since pink isnt in the rainbow anyway
<Rezo-chan> I watch this with sound off and it's STILL terrible
<MrPoniator> Haha
<Dee_Twenty> Anypony else hear "I heard that Curtis!" in their mind? XD
<MrPoniator> Oh my, after class!
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, there's no proper orange.
<RainbowLoon> OOOoooooOOOoo
<Pattyrick> that'd be interesting...
<DSNesmith> I'm pretty sure
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> best line ever
<Aponymous> ...
<DSNesmith> that in the fifth grade
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just ugly brown.
<MrPoniator> Oral presentation
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> oral
<DSNesmith> I didn't know how the female reproductive cycle worked
<Hipster_Brony> close enough
<NightSeas> 12aOS
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Pattyrick> xD
<MrPoniator> Neither did I by that age
<DSNesmith> hooker through the window
<RainbowLoon> i learned about that in elementary school
<Barbaloot> Are you serious?
<DSNesmith> what's the finale, she bursts out of a cake?
<Barbaloot> This movie I swear
<RainBroDash> :<
<Rezo-chan> elementary school varies by country. Which grade?
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> i wish this happened in my health class
<DSNesmith> ......
<Barbaloot> >Headrest
<DSNesmith> this movie needs to burn
<RainbowLoon> fourth grade iirc
<MrPoniator> Rezo-chan, you're asking me?
<sammywii> ....*facepalm*
<DSNesmith> did he draw boobs on her
<Rezo-chan> ...
<HaxBrony> holy crap
<Rezo-chan> What the HELL
<Rezo-chan> And yes
<MrPoniator> And lol, those girls
<HML-XD{GoD}> No
<DSNesmith> this is so wrong in so many wyas
<Pattyrick> a letter for every OS
<Barbaloot> He drew ovaries on her
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> those girls are lesbos
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Prostitots
<HML-XD{GoD}> wOS
<Purple`Prose> Everyone is bi in this school, apparently.
<HaxBrony> add #5 so far.
<Aponymous> Prostitots is now in my vocabulary.
<HML-XD{GoD}> gOS
<Pattyrick> aOS, bOS, cOS
<Pattyrick> although bOSs would be nice
<MrPoniator> They had sex ed for us on fifth grade, and again on eight
<HML-XD{GoD}> Now we know our OSes
<DSNesmith> our sex ed in fifth grade was
<Pattyrick> like bOS S
<Rezo-chan> 6th & 7th for us.
<DSNesmith> 'hormones suck'
<TVOTR532> yo bros, when the movies start
<TVOTR532> ?
<Barbaloot> 4th for us
<DSNesmith> 'have fun in middle school'
<Barbaloot> It was vague
<Pattyrick> LOL
<Dee_Twenty> You know, I'm pretty sure most teachers have keys to their own classroom.
<Barbaloot> But it worked
<HaveTubaWillTravel> In an hour and ten minutes, TVOTR
<MrPoniator> In a hour, TVOTE532
<MrPoniator> And lol
<Elky> tvotr: 2 hours
<NightSeas> 12Handles programs like a boss
<Rezo-chan> lol
<DSNesmith> this movie takes bad taste to new levels
<prince-dari> The orange is good. O__o
<HaxBrony> lol elky
<TVOTR532> TITS!
<Aponymous> Moms dead? Give her clothes to a prostitue
<prince-dari> Unless it looks different on mibbit.
<Rezo-chan> We actually had a copy of the school's master key circulating among us students.
<MrPoniator> We had plastic dicks in our eight grade sex ed, and girls had to put condoms on them
<Cynder7> 6Hey JLF
<Aponymous> Christmas Vacation reference?
<DSNesmith> .....
<MrPoniator> Quite awkward, I must say
<Rezo-chan> It was... Useful
<SirSprinkles> 6It looks light brown.

<HaveTubaWillTravel> LOL
<Barbaloot> It'll be nice to finally see it
<Cynder7> 6hsrtyuru?
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, it would be nice if either Silver or DCD came online...
<RainbowLoon> during formal training for civil service our class of all 18ys old had a hot instructor on health issues who demonstrated condom use on a banana
<Icy> never
<DSNesmith> so they go up to the treehouse
<DSNesmith> and have sex
<Cynder7> 6Why? D:<
<DSNesmith> ....
<MrPoniator> Okay

<Rezo-chan> The nineties were a horrible time for romantic comedies.
<Barbaloot> Clockwork Orange isn't that violant
<Rezo-chan> ... Well, all tiems are horrible for romantic comedies

<mib_4n0q9q> Bleh, Avatar(the movie) sucks.
<Ghosties> also
<SirSprinkles> 6THEY'RE DIFFERENT FROM US, WHICH MEANS THEY CAN'T BE TRUSTED
<DSNesmith> but I'm pretty sure it doesn't end with the white dudes taking all the indians' land
<Ghosties> Has anyone requested "Nick Cage Losing His Shit" yet?
<Dermathil> So, um, will Silver show up this week?
<DSNesmith> those apples have smallpox!

<Ghosties> alright
<Ghosties> Then I'll request
<Dee_Twenty> I actually liked Avatar, sure it's unoriginal but there's a reason the saying "There is nothing new under the sun." exists.
<Elky> why though?
<DSNesmith> I liked the humans in Avatar
<Dermathil> darnit.
<DSNesmith> I wanted them to win

*Shadow_Lugia 6gives a sigh of relief.
<SirSprinkles> Was already planning on playing it.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> nostalgia critic reviewed it
<Elky> Avatar bored me
<DSNesmith> although the ending is hilarious
<DSNesmith> they let the humans leave
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Yeah, it's a really good popcorn movie.

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Oh, wait:
*Shadow_Lugia 6is 4x resilient to it.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6:>
<Rezo-chan> Background material suggests strongly that earth government /likes/ the smurfs. It's only the corporation that wants them dead, United Fruit COmpany like
<DSNesmith> I loved Quaritch though
<DSNesmith> he's such a ham
<Cynder7> 6Wtf
<mib_4n0q9q> Pony and the Beast.
<MrPoniator> What's this, then?
<DSNesmith> disneypony night?
<Dermathil> Beauty and the Beast?
<DSNesmith> me gusta
<MrPoniator> Alrighty
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> IS EVERY DISNEY SONG A PONY MUSIC VIDEO?
<prince-dari> DO YOU EAT?
<Cynder7> 6<Justin_Long_Fanatic>: hey i'm at the part with the masses of enemies What game? o.o
<HaveTubaWillTravel> :D I see I'm not the only one who thought of this song in ep 1
<Purple`Prose> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shw3lYC6DsY
<DSNesmith> so 'Gotta Share' was a terrible song
<DSNesmith> but that dance
<Elky> wait, is this the melody the trolling song is based off?
<Dermathil> I think so, marewhoarrangestheblocks
<Icy> Lol, I keep telling suinide I'm against gay Marrige
<Elky> huh
<InsertCupcake> Ive just realised how much I like Disney
<DSNesmith> huh, you're right elky
<DSNesmith> I never realized that
<DSNesmith> derpy :D
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I think every song period is a PMV
<Cynder7> 6NO
<Dermathil> wow, nice find elky
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Barbaloot> I'd like to see a 2112 PMV
<Purple`Prose> The glory of Van Canto should be shared
<Barbaloot> That would be enetertaining
<NightSeas|Anime> 12We all have something were doing in our nick names XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to find some Aladdin PMVs...
<Dee_Twenty> Rule 32 of the Ponynet, there is Pony of it, no exceptions.
<DSNesmith> we've gotta see a hellfire PMV
<DSNesmith> with Rainbow singing about twilight
<Elky> oh god no
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> spyro eternal night
<HML-XD{GoD}> Yup
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Exactly, Dee_Twenty
<Elky> not that aladdin ytp
<DSNesmith> what, they made Rarity the old teapot? D:
<Cynder7> 6Aaa..which place exactly? :P
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> just beat the assassin
<Nickario> actually being a shadow lugia wouldnt that make you a dark type which is weak to fighting types?
<Pattyrick|drawing> xD
<RainbowLoon> hehe, voice matches the glasses
<HaveTubaWillTravel> "Thank the Lord" Not every day you hear that in a Disney movie, other than HoND
<Hipster_Brony> dari, you shoul post a better version of nyan dash
<DSNesmith> and HoND is decidedly ironic
<SirSprinkles> 6Can't play it. We don't play music videos that aren't ponies... it ends up controversial.
<prince-dari> Hipster_Brony: I like the GIF versions.
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry Purple.
<DSNesmith> I'll admit, the song fits
<prince-dari> Not the ones with actual clips from the show.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was humming winter wrap up while signing the receipt for my food and i didnt even realize it...
<Skylands|GoD> 10[17:10] <%drf|away> but yeah, let this be shown to anyone who doesn't like me: People still need me here :P <- *wonders if you realize the difference between being demodded and kicked out of the community forever*

<Hipster_Brony> i dunno
<Bjornfot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC32j1TIJRg
<Pattyrick> nommy cheese
<Dermathil> Its a case of trollism similar to the removal of the episodes from YTube
<Aurora> 6these espeons, they come in pairs
<MrPoniator> My face is text
<Elky> (I'm just saying that because I have no friends)
<DSNesmith> Kill Applejack D:

<Barbaloot> I should watch it again
<Ghosties> 4No one's spoken to him?
*Pattyrick sunggles with a random nearby Umbreon
<NightSeas|Anime> 12[15:36] <Pattyrick> What kind of cheese are you? <-- The kind Espeons like :3
<Espeon> 06Claim one get one for free.
<Espeon> 06It seems
<prince-dari> You've got so many requests piled up Sprinkles. XD
<HaxBrony> no google+. sry but im not movin to that shit
<MrPoniator> Welp, still not interested in social sites
<DSNesmith> is this the movie with the scary tunnel
<Pattyrick> Swiss?
<Hipster_Brony> 8themarewhoarrangestheblocks: http://i.imgur.com/8kx2B.jpg
<HaveTubaWillTravel> There's no earthly way of knowing
<HML-XD{GoD}> English :p
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Which direction we are going
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> that'd be interesting
<Icy> Rape
*Aurora 6imagines a world where you claim an exponentially growing number of espeons
<DSNesmith> is a hurricane a blowing?
<SirSprinkles> 6Most of them won't get played due to time.
<pony_yay> EPIC SAX
<DSNesmith> epic spike guy
<InsertCupcake> spike bulge 0.0
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> shame there's no more legend of
<MrPoniator> Epic Spike, sweet
<Suinide> Oo
<Pattyrick> first 2
*Aurora 6imagines said espeons in a sea of espeons
<prince-dari> Epic sax Spike is win.
<MrPoniator> Dat stomach
<Elky> needs more gummy gif
<InsertCupcake> lololol
<Pattyrick> then 4
<Tyranico> THE FIRES OF HELL ARE GLOWING!
<HML-XD{GoD}> Aurora is dreaming again :p
<Pattyrick> then 16
<Aurora> 6so many espeons
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> the new spyro looks dumb
<HaxBrony> ladies and gentlemen!
<NightSeas|Anime> 12Then 32
<HaxBrony> where is harvey dent!?
<HML-XD{GoD}> I can only handle 2^32 espeons
<Pattyrick> suddenly, there is a whole floofpile of Espeons as large as Kansas
<DSNesmith> anyone heard the Pendulum song of the scary tunnel?
<DSNesmith> I love that remix
<Gentle_Faith> harvey dent is good at hide and go seek
<Latias_fan> I agree
<HML-XD{GoD}> Big question is, where do all the espeons come from?
<Dermathil> I also heard that facebook got an automated system. Dunno if true, tho
<Glass_Arm> wb
<HaxBrony> SPAAACE
<DSNesmith> pink? PINK? piiiiiink
<Tyranico> Man I listened to Limp Bizkit when I was in 1st grade :D
<NintendoSegaFreak> I wish more people took art requests D:
<Pattyrick> they came from....
<MrPoniator> Pinkie, I'm in space
<Pattyrick> Germany
<Espeon> 06A sea of Espeons.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> READ A BOK
<DSNesmith> someone needs to mod a pinkie sphere into P2
<Elky> READ A BOOK
<MrPoniator> Okay, I'll read a book, sheesh
<Pyrate> READ A MOTHERFUCKING BOOK
<MrPoniator> Oh yes
<prince-dari> OH YES.
<prince-dari> That's win.
<MrPoniator> Pinkie Panther
<Elky> I'm glad poniator
<NightSeas|Anime> 12= A sea of Floof
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> who's spyro's voice in that one?
<Hipster_Brony> we have to play pinkiequest if we get posted before the show starts though
*Rezo-chan loved the pink panther
<prince-dari> ^
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> the new one
<Cynder7> 6Wow..I downloaded something and now Chrome tells me it'll need another 532 to finish downloading..
<Pattyrick> Espeon + Umbreon = Esbreon
<Aponymous> I would watch this.
<Aurora> 6a sea of espeons, glorious
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> wow chrome
<Aurora> 6but anyways
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> fail
<prince-dari> Pink Panther FTW
<Dee_Twenty> I still want a Pink Pony episode in S2.
<Cynder7> 6*532 days
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> O.O
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> wth
<Rezo-chan> I... can see that working
<DSNesmith> who COVERED the spice girls?
<NintendoSegaFreak> I wish they could hold an OC contest.
<HML-XD{GoD}> Can you draw us a sea of espeons?
<Pattyrick> what would an Esbreon look like?
<Hipster_Brony> 8Dee_Twenty: pinkie has had plenty of episodes
<DSNesmith> classy spike
<Aponymous> DSNesmith: I know right?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i think i read somewhere spyro's next voice actor will be rob paulsen
<Dermathil> There's ALREADY a pinkie sphere. I think its a reskin of Wheatley.
<Elky> that spice girls song is hell of a guilty pleasure
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..I think I can wait for another 1,5 year..
<Hipster_Brony> 8Dash needs more of them
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, definitely.
<MrPoniator> Spike is now dead
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> haha
<MrPoniator> RIP
<Cynder7> 6Who's he?
<HaxBrony> too many episodes with no dash.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> he's on jimmy neutron
<Aponymous> Spike needs his own spin off.
<Pyrate> She feels caring <3
<Tyranico> Dash needs more songs
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> he voices carl
<Roarart> 6...
<DSNesmith> I think AJ needs more love tbh
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> i feel like playing a quick game of empire total war while i wait for godfather
<Rezo-chan> The point of a pink pony episode would be to reference the classic pink panther cartoons, I think. Which WOULD be awesome
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I think I drew one before. Ovo
<Hipster_Brony> 8 1 episode with no Dash is too many
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I think.
<Elky> what ds said
<Gentle_Faith> space
<Dermathil> Out of the mane 6, Dash has the least screentime. Its been COUNTED>
<Roarart> 6I need to draw all the falseons we've come up with in this channel
<NintendoSegaFreak> ...
<MrPoniator> Oh yes
<Dee_Twenty> Hipster_Brony: Yes, but she hasn't hand any Pink Pony style episodes with no dialogue, just slapstick and catchy music.
<Dee_Twenty> NAAAAAAAAAAATUUUUUUUUUUURE!
<Dermathil> Hipster: Look before you sleep
<Sathi> and back
<Tyranico> Pinkie and Dash should do a duet song
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm playing It's Friday Night before the mane 7 PM showing.
<Aponymous> My EARS
*Nickario thingks there should be a ghosteon eveelution
<Pattyrick> Vapespeon
<DSNesmith> you eat pieces of shit for breakfast ololol
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats my point Dermathil
<Elky> derma: literal screen time doesn't equal focus on a pony
<SirSprinkles> 6And You Are A Pirate, because it's our official New Mod song.
<MrPoniator> Sonic b-
<HaveTubaWillTravel> AJ and Dash should do a duet :D
<Nickario> or fighting type
<DSNesmith> oh this
<DSNesmith> hah
<Pyrate> ...
<RainBroDash> aww yeaaaaaaaah
<thetrollside> ima say something i always say in here, rainbow pony s best pony
<Bjornfot> EAT SHIT
<DSNesmith> fluttershy, you so naughty
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Y'know, it might've been a long time ago I made that sprite up.
<Dermathil> Elky: I know.
<Elky> eat shit, mister bear
<Hipster_Brony> 8need a Dash solo song is S2
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and he's imaginary gary on fairly oddparents
<MrPoniator> I want someone to hax Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition
<HaxBrony> agreed.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Barbaloot> This sounds like Offspring too
<Dermathil> Agreed, Hipster.
<Gentle_Faith> ^^^
<prince-dari> Fuck you Mr bunny.
<MrPoniator> So that Sonic booms are rainbow colored and all
<NintendoSegaFreak> I wish people actually listened to things I said...
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Tyranico> Hipster_Brony: How about 2?
<Latias_fan> The day when he stops smiling is the day we remember his smile
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, yeah
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I think Veyka counts enough as an Espeon/Umbreon mix.
<pony_yay> heheeh i demand tp for my bunghole
<Barbaloot> Yeah it's hard when there's so many people
<Icy> Up yours Mr bear
<Elky> xD
<Cynder7> 6I think I'll take that for an SCS just cause it's random.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would be fine if every episode had a Dash song
<Dermathil> something to think of though: What would make Dash break into a solo song?
<Hipster_Brony> ok
<NintendoSegaFreak> I doubt the allcaps things works either D:
<Espeon> 06Flarjoltporeon.
<Rezo-chan> Meh.
<DSNesmith> Asleigh ball signing ponies
<HaxBrony> and me, well i BLAHHHH!
<Rezo-chan> Dash is meh.
<Cynder7> 6Awesome..Dari,Icy,keep it up pl0x. ^^
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> did anyone see fairly odd movie?
<Espeon> 06And yes, he does.
<DSNesmith> that was amazing
<Hipster_Brony> the gokaiger version, right?
<InsertCupcake> that pie take cracks me up everytime
<pony_yay> DAT B-BIT
<NintendoSegaFreak> Come on, OC contest... anybody?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<thetrollside> REZO
<Barbaloot> LOL oc
<thetrollside> NO
<Cynder7> 6Nope..
<Latias_fan> I saw a bit of it
<Barbaloot> >Implying I have talent
<Espeon> 06Twice the fun, in another way
<SirSprinkles> 6Might actually play Pinkie Quest then instead.
<MrPoniator> Pitch that idea to Equestria Daily or so
<NintendoSegaFreak> Would it be that bad?
<HaxBrony> Dash is epic. rezo ಠ_ಠ
<NintendoSegaFreak> lol
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> why do people hat OCs?
<SirSprinkles> 6Since it's a 16 minute gap...
<DSNesmith> anyone singing along?
<Nickario> if there was a fighting type eveelution it should be called
<Cynder7> 6HELLS TO THE YEAH. 567 days left
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> hate?
<Nickario> Puncheon
<NintendoSegaFreak> Yeah, what's wrong with OCs?
<Barbaloot> I don't hate OC
<prince-dari> How big is the download?
<Dee_Twenty> Rainbow Pony is least best pony.
*Nickario is tomato'd in the face
<DashAttack> aw, dammit. i missed Anthologies?
<NintendoSegaFreak> I appreciate that stuff, and hell, I've got my own.
<Barbaloot> I just can't CREATE THE STUFF
<Bjornfot> because sonic
<thetrollside> DEE
<Rezo-chan> Dash is a bogstandard female jock character the likes of which have been dime a dozen for the past two decades. Sorry.
<Hipster_Brony> http://i.imgur.com/8kx2B.jpg
<Bjornfot> and furries
<thetrollside> NEIN
<Cynder7> 6 701 MB
<MrPoniator> Eh, I prefer canon characters than OCs
<Barbaloot> because my fingers are for strictly gaming
<HaxBrony> Rainbow Pony is always best pony.
*Nickario aura spheres tomato thrower
<HML-XD{GoD}> Ohai Nickario
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I don't haate OCs either. They can be done well, but it's just that they so rarely are
<Aponymous> Nothing wrong with OCs, people just hate Mary Sues/Gary Stues.
<MrPoniator> Since you don't really know OCs so well
<Cynder7> 6I don't care about it really..
*Pattyrick gets tomatoed back
*HML-XD{GoD} pokes
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> it was good
<Dee_Twenty> Pink Pony is best pony.
<NintendoSegaFreak> Just give them flaws.
<Ghosties> 4DCD gives his regards
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> just like the cartoon
<MrPoniator> Okay
<NintendoSegaFreak> And they won't be Mary Sues.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Rainbow pony is best pony, anyone who says otherwise is bad and should feel bad
<thetrollside> rainbow pony s best pony
<Latias_fan> Meh
<Elky> My OC is an Alicorn, he's Luna's younger sister, but he hates being this beautiful and having so much power, more than the princesses
<MrPoniator> My pony is weak to color yellow
<Dermathil> Is FO:E an example of well-made OCs?
<Pyrate> When I made my RP character, I took my persona
<thetrollside> yes
<thetrollside> it is
<Hipster_Brony> ok
<Latias_fan> didn't care much about the cartoon
<DSNesmith> best pony is the one with a perfectly coifed mane
<Ghosties> 4Vinyl Scratch is best pony. I don't feel bad at all
<Pyrate> and ripped one of his arms off
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Eee-up, Derma
<DashAttack> agreed Hipster
*Rezo-chan does not feel bad for thinking that Rarity pony is the bestest pony of all time.
<Hipster_Brony> did he say anything else
<Dermathil> MrPoniator: Ponified Green Lantern then.
<Pyrate> That counts as a flaw, right?
<Hipster_Brony> ?
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> Too many OCS that act all innocent and unworthy in pony fanfics is my problem with them
<Dee_Twenty> Rainbow Pony doesn't have a song about being best pony like Pink Pony. :p
<Lolipop_of_Doom> inb4 HASBRO
<Barbaloot> lol wat
<Latias_fan> still can't believe Tara Strong voices Timmy
<Bjornfot> I see Ghosties be Ghostin' again...
<Barbaloot> >Ripped arm off
<InsertCupcake> Why do I like Lyra so much?
<Pyrate> Yeah
<DSNesmith> I just realized
<MrPoniator> I'll make my OC a psychopath killer
<Hipster_Brony> 8i love that jumping dash sprite
<Pyrate> He's one-armed
<DSNesmith> I know all the lyrics to Winter Wrap Up
<MrPoniator> Bwahahahaha
<DashAttack> Rainbow pony broke the sound barrier so hard the excess energy folded over into the visible spectrum
<DashAttack> like a boss
<Cynder7> 6Anyway..I started it some hours ago..I have two of the same downloading..the 567 day one has downloaded 0.1 MBs and the other one,which is 121 days left has gotten 0.5 MBs..
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Because she's the best pony, Cupcake :D
<Pyrate> Might get a robotic appendage later, if I get the chance
<HaxBrony> like a bawss
<Pyrate> Oh, and wings.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> She's like HTC phones: quietly brilliant
<Dee_Twenty> Why did I read that as visible rectum? XD
<prince-dari> ...
<Pyrate> I've always wanted wings
<prince-dari> Wow.
<DashAttack> rofl
<Zanzi> I can't believe I just spent brony appreciation day stuck in a doctor's office... :/

<Justin_Long_Fanatic> she voices dil
<fredfred99> Thank you Jesus
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and bubbles
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> we need OC because they are not enough male characters in the show
<Bjornfot> VISIBLE PLOT
<NintendoSegaFreak> I commissioned someone once for a big pic with my OC and other characters xD
<Pyrate> You look freaking majestic with wings
<NintendoSegaFreak> And my OC is male.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dammit Sethisto, we're about to start...
<prince-dari> Dee_Twenty: Thanks for the mental image. >_>
<Latias_fan> She was Kaede in Killer 7
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol hangover chicken
<Hipster_Brony> 8im hoping that will change in season 2
<Ziltoid> ow
<Dee_Twenty> You're welcome. :p
<MrPoniator> Don't scare me, fluttershy
<Hipster_Brony> 8now that hasbro knows they have male fans
<Pyrate> (oh and if it isn't clear my character's humanoid)
<Cynder7> 6Hangover chicken? o.o
*Rezo-chan is okay with lotsa girl ponies.
<Dermathil> There is a vast number of male OCs to cover the bases left uncovered by the vast majority of female background ponies.
<Hipster_Brony> nothing we can really do now
<MrPoniator> Dat music
<DSNesmith> Nine Filly Tails
<Elky> I agree with Rezo
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i'm watching the hangover
<Cynder7> 6Got bored of playing Portal? :P
<HaveTubaWillTravel> brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
<InsertCupcake> i kinda like the mojarity being female
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i love portal
<thetrollside> i dont mind all the plot in S1
<Dermathil> Title: Naruto derp song I bet
<NintendoSegaFreak> Someone told me that it's because it parallels real life, when males
<Hipster_Brony> in retrospect, i should have given him a heads up yesterday that we were starting earlier
<Aponymous> Hmm, intriguing.
<Pattyrick> what kind of background should I draw for my Zebstrika picture to give the feeling of 'The Plains'?
<NintendoSegaFreak> mate with a whole bunch of females.
<Latias_fan> anyone played Killer 7?
<prince-dari> Bubbles? They be on Derpy's butt.
<Icy> What?
<Elky> dari: is that bjornfot's request?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> ewww billy ray cyrus
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I like the idea of Equestria being a matriarchal society
<prince-dari> Elky: No.
<Elky> because it's pretty cool so far
<Cynder7> 6I don't think I've even heard of it..
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Adds to the depth of the world
<Barbaloot> Holy shit MASH is on it 15 minutes
<Cynder7> 6D:
<SirSprinkles> 6Probably, but... *shrug*
<DSNesmith> I don't think Equestria's Matriarchal
<prince-dari> Elky: You'll know when you see Bjornfot's request.
<DSNesmith> so much as Monarchial
<fredfred99> There is something fundamentally wrong with equestria (I dont know how to do Links)
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i wanna see harry potter 7 part 2

<Hipster_Brony> 8dammit, we arent actually showing that, are we, dari?
<Elky> we probably won't have sexy naughty bitchy Rarity then?
*Rezo-chan thinks of it as a show that's focussing on a group of girls, and their antics. Other demographics are consequently peripheral.
<DSNesmith> ^love that one
<SirSprinkles> 6EEEEEEEEEEnope.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Dermathil> I can bet the original song of this thing's called Nine Fox tails
<Unknown> Celestia's not even a pony, she's an avatar of the sun.
<HaxBrony> haha

<NintendoSegaFreak> Anyways, Imma go.

<MrPoniator> Oh god, baby geniuses
<Aponymous> DSNesmith: How about no?
<DSNesmith> no, I'm sorry, no baby geniuses
<DSNesmith> that was a terrible idea
<Tyranico> WhatPayne: this is going to be one hell of a night
*InsertCupcake just got a hug off his mom
<HaxBrony> lol
<Dee_Twenty> Ah well, at least the power surged during a song I don't like anyway instead of Fluttershys or the movies or something.
<DSNesmith> olol

<Ray||SMG2> 02I totaly didn't forget that I have this game |D
<DSNesmith> YES
<Icy> Well that's a bit shallow don't you think?
<Rezo-chan> I can't imagine something worse than spider's web
<DSNesmith> rarity is BEST PONY
<Latias_fan> Hell no i fucking hate Call of Duty
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> ONE DAY WE NEED TO WATCH SPIDERS WEB AGAIN JUST CAUSE

<DSNesmith> foot stamp
<SirSprinkles> 6I knew he had given me a reason when he said he might not make it.
<Dermathil> JUST NO.
<MrPoniator> Rarity is fine
<DSNesmith> rarity wins everything
<InsertCupcake> Im not aware of this Spiders web stuff
<Cynder7> 6Hooray for Dari having CoD4!
<MrPoniator> I'm only disturbed by her make-up in Sonic Rainboom ep
<HML-XD{GoD}> Link mah boi
<Dee_Twenty> Why do ponies make even the shittiest songs tolerable?
<Cynder7> 6Aah.. D:
<DSNesmith> yeah that was not her best fashion choice
<HML-XD{GoD}> These nick changes are a pain
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> well i'll see everyone later
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> bye

<SilverSonic> lmfao
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..
<DSNesmith> I used to hate this song
<SilverSonic> someone has my link nick
<CATMUNCHER> Rairity knows how to handle herself in public unlike most women
<DSNesmith> then rarity sang it
<DSNesmith> suddenly it was cool
<Icy> Besides, I really don't see whythe movies are that bad, not perfect but not bad
<SilverSonic> buts reg'd by me ;pp
<Link> 3hey I'm Nick so its ok if I Nick change right?
*Link 3is beaten with wand of Gamelon
<WhatPayne> DSN exactly!
<prince-dari> Ponies make all songs better.
<DSNesmith> ponies can even make Katy Perry sound good
<Cynder7> 6The maps in multiplayer are quite good too..
<Barbaloot> Pretty much
<Rezo-chan> Rarity does that to everything she touches.
<Tyranico> Never heard this song before this video. Now I actually like it. Weird huh?
<Nick> sorry SS
<Aponymous> Ponies make everything 20% cooler
<Elky> I didn't know the song before the PMV, but this is my favourite one.
<Cynder7> 6I love Wet Work.. :3
<HaxBrony> ponies make 99% of terrible songs good
<SilverSonic> Nuu its fine
<Hipster_Brony> 8DSNesmith: nope.avi
<SilverSonic> you can use it XD
<Bjornfot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVq2sCvtOHc
<SirSprinkles> 6No Soarin... : /
<Dermathil> you know what? We really gotta start to delve in the IMDb Top 250 to redeem our eyes for Spider's web.
*SilverSonic doesnt care
<Latias_fan> Bad humor numerous plotholes annoying charcters the list goes on
<DSNesmith> lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8tolerable, but not good
<Nick> just noticed it was reg'd
<prince-dari> Maybe ponies could even make Friday good, but thinking about it 20% of 0 is still 0.
<SilverSonic> XD
<MrPoniator> Guile's theme doesn't go with Ponies. Ponies go with Guile
<DSNesmith> oh come on, Equestria Girls was fantastic
<HaxBrony> lol
<Ziltoid> Nothing can make friday sound good
<prince-dari> Hipster_Brony: You didn't like Equestria Girls?
<Bjornfot> I have the wingest boner.
<Ghosties> 4Purple'Prose
<Nick> but yeah after playing OoT and then finishing it I dl'd link's awakening
<DSNesmith> damn, you know what I'd like to see
<pony_yay> Katie Perry has her moments
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol guys, you can stop requesting things
<Ghosties> 4That user I like
<DSNesmith> Rarity vs. Fluttershy
<Hipster_Brony> 8its 7 minutes to showtime
<DSNesmith> in a passive aggressive battle for the ages
<prince-dari> That was pretty much the highlight of my year for the shoutouts. I love it.
<Dee_Twenty> What's wrong with Friday? It's not my favourite day of the week but it's no Sunday.
<Nick> my zelda needs cannot be quenched atm
<Dermathil> wait, PurpleProse is around?
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari: tolerable, not good
<Ghosties> 4Oh well
<Purple`Prose> Yes
<Purple`Prose> Fluttershy would win
<Dermathil> ooh nicee
<prince-dari> Wow, hard to please much? O_o
<Ghosties> 4I don't blame him for not being around...then again, we did get everything fixed
<WhatPayne> Oh we're about to start?
<Elky> I agree with dari, it was awesome
<Hipster_Brony> 8the fact that it wasnt katy perry helped
<Linkario> xD
*Pattyrick throws Triforce and a random chicken at Linkario
<Ghosties> 4OH
<Purple`Prose> Derm: why?
<Ghosties> 4Guys
<Icy> The humor was really toned down in dotm, the plothole were lessend, the characters, no matter how minor served some kind of purpose

<Roarart> 6yes?
<marewhoarrangestheblocks> IT TAKES ME LIKE 5 MINS TO GET BACK IN CHAT, DONT BAN ME
<HaxBrony> hipster_brony agreed but i still love Equestria girls
<Bjornfot> weh, sound bleh
<DSNesmith> best part is that he transposed this by ear
<MrPoniator> I've done a few simple melodies, but nothing like this
<Hipster_Brony> 8its ok
<Dermathil> Prince-dari: there are programs that make that kind of stuff in 1/2 hour
<prince-dari> To be honest I think he was putting it on a lot.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6http://quanyails.deviantart.com/art/Suiguno-IV-229343721 <-- Look at this sprite's back wing. How do I make those feathers look less like peas? XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8i liked the iphone commercial more
<Nick> but I just remembered, anyone who saw the intro to movie 8 did they feel a slight zelda overtone with Sir Aaron and the princess in the film?
<HaxBrony> that made me lol so much
<Elky> typical hipster
<Ghosties> 4HaxBrony: And the only way Equestria Girls is likeable is if it's featuring Nigel Thornberry
<DSNesmith> still, Equestria Girls was when Hasbro went
<DSNesmith> 'lol bronies sup'
<Icy> Not gonna argue there, but I like how they were in the book
<Gentle_Faith> I cant deal with Katy Perry enough to watch equestria girls with a smile Ponys or not
<HaxBrony> Blaaarg!
<Icy> for dotm
<marewhoarrangestheblocks> Hipster_Brony: iphone commercial was awesome
<Articuno> 12SORRY

<Dee_Twenty> I don't get it, why are we looking at boxes with a cover of Winter Wrapup playing? o_O
<Hipster_Brony> he was being pissy since we decided not to interview him after he missed 3 interviews
<prince-dari> "so what if I would have gotten thrown out of the house if I didn't do what my dad said"? That seems put on to me.
<pony_yay> ELLO' IM NIGEL THORNBARRY

<Ghosties> 4Yes, dari

<prince-dari> A lot of STU-
<DSNesmith> READ A BOOK
<Ghosties> 4...Did Sethisto post us?
<Aponymous> This show made my balls fall off, and then grow back twice as large.
<Legion> Silly. Books ARE friends!
<DashAttack> i can count to books
<Hipster_Brony> not yet
*TGPfluttershy raises his bottle in the air I'll drink you Twilight, my favorite nerd

<Srake> Why is Lyra in Canterlot?
<RainBroDash> 10@TGP I hear that brother
<sammywii> Poor Spike....
<HuffytheMagicDragon> spike spiegel
<MrPoniator> I realized that I grew a moustache while watching this show
<InsertCupcake> ninjad by dragonrage
<Ghosties> 4That's why there's so little viewers. Alright, cool
<Pyrate> What did you do with the old balls, Aponymous?
<Hipster_Brony> he always emails me and get a desktop update
<DSNesmith> so is it just me or does spike sound really young in this episode?
<Rezo-chan> Lyra gets around.
<Dee_Twenty> Real reason she doesn't want to go to Moondancers party is because she doesn't want to see her moon dance.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> she missed her birthday lol
<Aponymous> They shrivelled and died.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I think it was intentional, DSN
<DragonRage> Lyra is actually a secret agent working for Celestia. Her mission is to spy on Twilight to make sure she doesn't goof off instead of learning about friendship.
<HaxBrony> lol gimmi dat spike
<prince-dari> MFW stream is skipping all over the place.
<Aponymous> So I threw them out.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> To establish a sense of chronology

<DSNesmith> like, chronologically
<HuffytheMagicDragon> yo ya know lyra is immortal?
<HaxBrony> 9 hours somethin

<Dermathil> we know, Ghosties. I spotted the Rocky one in Bird in the Hoof
<Elky> there's a hole in my coffee pot
<DSNesmith> lol, watch the hourglass
<Rezo-chan> the episodes are non-chronological
<HaveTubaWillTravel> It probably is about a year, or just under a year
<Pyrate> Isn't it kinda sad that Princess Luna only was a mare's tale?

<Elky> o hi dashite
<TGPFluttershy> Trolling bird is trolling!
