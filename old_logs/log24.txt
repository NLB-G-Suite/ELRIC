<NewDCD> 9my name comes from him
<Silverscreen> 14FALCON KIIIICK!
<nickstr> better hardware, software, and user support, fewer buggy applications, better documentation, better software compatibility
<SummerSong> 0DCD as DCD
<SummerSong> 0Wait
<Sionx> I think that we know that already lol
<MtChar> if youre aids then what am i?
<CowboyTJ> http://cinemassacre.com/2011/06/03/overanalyzers-4-ernest/
<twilightboy> glitch in the force!
<Armageddon> you're a mountain
<Ascendant> nah
<twilightboy> know what time it is guys?
<Enterprize> GAME TIME
<twilightboy> pony time.
<Ascendant> windows is sucky anyway
<NewDCD> 9CLIMAX TIME
<mib_gl8c76> so see ya next week
<Enterprize> oh, well I was close
<CowboyTJ> PARTY TIME
<nickstr> I call bullsh!t on that
<Ascendant> more common applications are built for it, yes
<MtChar> ok..
<mib_gl8c76> guile theme
<MtChar> then what is err umm
<nickstr> Linux sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Ascendant> but it's coded quite crappily and is bloody bloated
<MtChar> bed
<nickstr> but in its own ways
<Silverscreen> 14GUILE THEME!
<MtChar> what is bed
<Ascendant> linux is awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying to decide between RAID0 and RAID6
<drfsupercenter> 03er 5
<Sionx> go home and be family rider
<Ascendant> lmfao RAID0
<nickstr> Linux can't do crap compared to Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03I have four 2TB drives. It would be nice to be able to get 8TB total
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's risky
<nickstr> if you are a gamer you are screwed
<drfsupercenter> 03with RAID5, I could at least replace one
<Ascendant> well yeah, no sane gamer uses linux
<Silverscreen> 14SONIC RAINBOOM!
<Ascendant> RAID5 is pretty decent
<nickstr> plus if you have anything but a select bunch of devices you are screwed too
<Ascendant> depends
<nickstr> also if you have any oddly configured devices in your system you are screwed
<Ascendant> well of course
<nickstr> if you have any but a select few video capture and TV tuner cards you are screwed
<NewDCD> 9okay I'm running out of ideas
<NewDCD> 9and I'm a bit tired
<Ascendant> eh I never use those sort of things anyway
<NewDCD> 9so tell ya what, I'll see if I can stream stuff tomorrow
<Wolf-man> alright good night everypony!
<Ascendant> not a lot of people do anyway
<twilightboy> throw on winter wrapup
<nickstr> think about THAT before you bash Windows or any other OS despite Linux
<Wolf-man> Its been fun
<NewDCD> 9I'll say so on the thread, so keep your eye on them
<Ascendant> linux suits my purposes, unlike windows
<nickstr> you are coming off as a huge fanboy/fangirl here
<twilightboy> bye wolf
