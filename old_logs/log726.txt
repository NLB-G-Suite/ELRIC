<ScootaChicken1> What the hoo boy doggies is going on in here.
<AJIsAwesome> BlazeAngel: No. :D
<BlazeAngel> And my + is gone again.
<CrimsonPhoenix> followed by Sand Josieph
<BlazeAngel> OKAY. Who ate my +?
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: And here I am, trying to find a song you haven't heard that you may give emotion to as well

<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: <3

<Cypresswolf> PeachStreak: not right now - just talking about glitches I remember seeing - last played Skyrim in August

<XAX> Deacon: Do you play Gmod? :|
<razorwing1269> i cant resist 3 days more i want th third season now
<Deacon> I do have Gmod, but I'm still not sure how to use it
<XAX> Ah.
<Cypresswolf> I sneak back up the stairs and watch as they walk back and forth, one faces the wall with back turned to me, I ready an arrow and fire it...
<XAX> HEY
<XAX> That was soooo delayed...
<Deacon> razorwing1269 it's been almost 200 days since season 2 finale, I sure you can wait three more days
<Cypresswolf> just when a bandit runs out of the room on the right and into the path of my arrow - instant kill :D

<DeadpoolDash> buying hasbro is a natural progression for disney since hasbro already makes most of the Marvel and Star Wars toys you see on shelves
<HoodyNinja> DeadpoolDash: Not gonna happen
<HoodyNinja> Better not, anyway
<HoodyNinja> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Ykf4R8lLM
<Everlasting_Joy> sub06905: Ah yes, the original.
<DeadpoolDash> hopefully it wont, but money talks
<FlutterMEDIC> now that i think about, wouldn't that become a monopoly if Disney buys Hasbro, since they would own a majority of the entertainment market?
<DeadpoolDash> tell that to sony
<CrimsonPhoenix> lol
<HoodyNinja> EA
<HoodyNinja> So, nobody has Torchlight 2, huh?
<CrimsonPhoenix> if Disney buys a video game studios then I'll be scared
<HoodyNinja> ^
<DeadpoolDash> disney already has video game studios
<scout19_tf2> disney will fuq it all up im sure
<CrimsonPhoenix> and then we have a rumor saying that Disney is thinking of buying Nintendo
<CrimsonPhoenix> OR

<CrimsonPhoenix> HoodyNinja, probably right
<Bronysith> He is dead and forever will be
<twoiloight_spurnkle> longest word ine the world with over 181k letters is also a chemical name

<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: You know, we have the technology...
<twoiloight_spurnkle> thats quite cool PeachStreak
<HoodyNinja> WHO

<HoodyNinja> One syllable at a time
<Chrysalis> http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20222998 this is rather annoying news
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: you do realize how long it will take for you to type it out?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Zebrafari / Motherly Love
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: and get it verbatim without messing a single character up
<twoiloight_spurnkle> HoodyNinja: i'll be typing it for the next several months
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chrysalis, OH GAWD WOW
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Copy paste?
<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: No wonder i never see you on here
<Chrysalis> CrimsonPhoenix ikr, one of the few decent chat systems
<Chrysalis> closing down :(
<HoodyNinja> I hate fingernails...
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: simple solution
<Bronysith> bite them off
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chrysalis, WLM was decent but I gotta admit Skype is gaining ALOT of grounds
*Saturn 08,01fingernails HoodyNinja
<HoodyNinja> Well, what is that word even for?
*HoodyNinja sits on Saturn
<Chrysalis> i like that they are allowing contact migration
<Chrysalis> but more people will end up going to facebook chat
<Chrysalis> which means even more friends i can't talk to
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again WLM was a microsoft product so this news just shows us that microsoft gives up
<twoiloight_spurnkle> HoodyNinja: the name of a molecule iirc
<Chrysalis> well, they are focusing on the more popular product
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chrysalis, why?
<Chrysalis> considering they own both makes sense
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Saturn
<kidzrul732> I hate weather
<CrimsonPhoenix> I mean why would your friends go on facebook when they can migrate in skype?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> hm, chatsplosion
<Chrysalis> because skype is a PITA compared to WLM
<CrimsonPhoenix> PITA?
<Chrysalis> pain in the ass
<CrimsonPhoenix> not for me
<Everlasting_Joy> I remember when you could show your screen on Skype for free.
<CrimsonPhoenix> (btw guys crimsonphoenix is my skype name add pls thanku)
<Bronysith> nope

<HoodyNinja> twoiloight_spurnkle: Dafuq is the molecule? Magic?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> HoodyNinja: heck if i know, i suck at chemistry
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, have I ever told you how much I love you?
<HoodyNinja> Got to be the most useless name ever
<Saturn> 08,01there's a chemical called arabbitol
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: you are an ass to my friends, leave me alone
<Saturn> 08,01because it looks like a rabbit
<HoodyNinja> 181+ k words, no one is ever going to use that

*Kurra volunteers for blanketing duty o_o7
<sonicdude558> dawww Luna
*sonicdude558 hugs, snuggles by Luna and offers her a Twi plushie
<Kurra> The fat. The Insulating. The Kurrines. -_-7
<CrimsonPhoenix> by the way guys http://fav.me/d5kd8bv
<Kandarihu> For once, I'd like to see this whole cliche deconstructed. One where nuking the enemy early on is the ONLY way to avoid incalculable civilian casualties, and the scientist arguing to find peaceful alternatives is merely in league with the enemy and the whole story ends with him/her standing trial for treason.
*RDash5000 hugs luna
<Everlasting_Joy> sonicdude558: That had better not be Wre-K's Twi plushie.
<sonicdude558> nah
<RDash5000> how was your day Luna ?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: i got that for him
<sonicdude558> it was this - http://i.imgur.com/JuUXf.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Already in my favorites. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, have you read Background pony?
<Everlasting_Joy> sonicdude558: Okay.
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Not really in the mood of reading any fanfics. :)
<emangamer> Luna, your mane is made of space and stars, how are you not cold all the time?
<DerpyMuffins> They put so much filler in the end of this
<AJIsAwesome> emangamer: Magic. ;3
<Luna> 07,01I don't know emangamer I think I got used to it
<RoboGerbil> nice find CrimsonPhoenix i just finished reading the latest chapter least night
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, how can you fav an art that is clearly from a fanfic if you haven't read it?
<sonicdude558> screw Wre-k, mine is made out of Minky :P
<Luna> 07,01also magic
<Everlasting_Joy> Wait, is that guy the brother of the TF2 medic?
<AJIsAwesome> *:3

*emangamer the plushie poofs and turns out to be a log
<AttackWithHugs> Who's streaming what?
*Ryunosuke gives Luna a moon pie
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, AttackWithHugs! :)
<Bronysith> emangamer: naruto the abridged series is the worst abridged series
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute. She's giving the general grief about wanting to nuke the monsters, believing that they'll absorb all the energy from the nuke. And her more reasonable alternative is overloading them with energy.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy AttackWithHugs!
*RDash5000 wishes he had a plushie...
<Ryunosuke> om nom nom nom
<Vordox> Luuunaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<AJIsAwesome> Shizu's streaming, Crysis I think. :)
*Vordox glomps Luna!

<Everlasting_Joy> Kandarihu: Makes sense to me!

<Kurra> Stream can't take the awesome
<CriticKitten> Damn, it takes rockets to the face like a pro
<emangamer> Meanwhile: nah, because then they want your blood AND your brains, there's nothing left once they're done with you

<Reikim> Also hi.
<Kurra> Dark92Enigma: nono, I don't even know what you were saying....
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: What's your steam name?

<AJIsAwesome> JUMP JUMP JUMP JUMP
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: True but it is incredibly mediocre.
*Jmo squeezes AttackWithHugs
<Dark_Horst> you'd think a game that was the most grphacally advanced game of his time.... and possibly todays time still, would be remembered
<Meanwhile> emangamer: But I thought Aragorn had that.
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry, Derpy_Hooves. :D
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: not really
<emangamer> Meanwhile: Nah man, Aragorn has the mirror sheild

<Everlasting_Joy> Outside of the "I want the player to see the sinking", wouldn't you have closed the hatch by now?
<Meanwhile> emangamer: Probably.
<Aponymouss> Like. A. Faust.
<Meanwhile> Nope.
<DerpyMuffins> Take the V-tol Nomad
<Dark_Horst> crysis gave you absolute freedom of movement in the missions and had it's gameplay change continuously during it'S progress. and everything it did, it did very well. not mentioning that the idea with the nanosuit was brandnew back then
<twoiloight_spurnkle> crisis is a pretty bad game imo
<Reikim> Yes.
<otakon> how the HELL is Prophet alive?

<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: X at C3
<mitamaking> Isn't A2 the top middle
<Kandarihu> I love it when science fiction drives science fact
<Jmo> >_>
<Casey1859> Ohyeah.

<Meanwhile> There's vomit on his sweater already.
<XylemTube> Spaghetti is in bloom
<mitamaking> Page 349? Geeze that is a small reference
<Casey1859> And for some reason, the line "open your books to page 394" escalated to a minor harry potter meme.
<Punkie_Pue> Mom's Spaghetti?
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Lupin teaches DADA in PoA and he misses a class. Snape teaches the class for that day and says "Turn to page 394."
<Saturn> 08,01and working again \o/
<Jmo> I herd u lik hary pota fluffeh
<Jmo> :3

<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Page 394 is the page in the book about werewolves
<Casey1859> Oh, it is?
<Meanwhile> See I'm failing to see how that's relevant.
<Meanwhile> Are you implying that I'm a werewolf?
<Casey1859> I thought it was about wizard tic-tac-toe
<mitamaking> AttackWithHugs: Snape is an a**
<AttackWithHugs> Remus Lupin is a werewolf. Snape did that to see who would realize the connection
<Casey1859> Huh.

<twoiloight_spurnkle> radioactive green
<CrimsonPhoenix> twoiloight_spurnkle, but my background is white
<AttackWithHugs> Wrek's text looks brown on mIRC but on lightIRC it looks dark red.

<flutterchu> Wrek: oh-oh i LOVE BLOOD...it's so delish....wait, I THOUGHT YOU WERE EVIL FLUTTERCHU!!!!!!!!
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: It looks like a regular brown and I'm using the same client. I guess the client you're using and what your screen settings are sometimes changes color
<AJIsAwesome> Why not, Meanwhile? :<
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome: Because fun is not fun.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> squidwards philosophy

<twoiloight_spurnkle> lul
<Tovler> only a few more days till the new season of Adventure Time. It's been a long 3 or 4 weeks, but its finally back.
<Meanwhile> Sorry Wrek, poking otakon has become too light natured in my usual environment in comparison. I'll calm down.
<Derpy_Hooves> floof
<DashWithRainbows> Tovler New season?
<flutterchu> Tovler: that show is cool
<DashWithRainbows> Dayum
<Derpy_Hooves> all the floof
<Wrek> 05thank you.
<Derpy_Hooves> is mine
<AttackWithHugs> Adventure Time....I've never watched it
<Jmo> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: By the way. How was the episode involving the Ice King and Marceline turn out?
<Jmo> I tried watching an episode, but got bored.
<flutterchu> \/
<AttackWithHugs> I think I'm missing out on something by not doing so but I'm not sure
<AJIsAwesome> AttackWithHugs: It's probably one of the only saving graces of Cartoon Network. But you dont have to watch it, I don't think you're missing out on much. :)
<AttackWithHugs> One of my friends has that ringtone from Regular Show
<NocturnalBlade> i like Adventure Time lol and lol AttackWithHugs thats cool what is it?
<AttackWithHugs> The one that goes "Something something ringtone, pick up your telephone"
<Tovler> AJIsAwesome: It didn't get many feels at that episode… at first.
<AttackWithHugs> Or something like that. I don't know.
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: What was it mainly about? :)
<NocturnalBlade> AttackWithHugs: ah...yea i got nothing lol
<flutterchu> \/ V v ⱽ ᵛ
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not an avid fan of the show, but it's a pretty good one.
<Tovler> :'( Now I've got that song in my head again.
<otakon> lol
<otakon> brb guys need a drink
<flutterchu> so Shizuka's streaming?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> yes
<flutterchu> oh boy
<AJIsAwesome> Much better than that "Annoying Orange' show they managed to get on there. Why did they need to have the CONCEPT for a show like that? :S
<AttackWithHugs> I think Shizuka is the only mod (that I know of) that streams sciency stuff besides How It's Made.
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: CN tries to get Good ratings?
<CrimsonPhoenix> What in Equestria am I looking at? http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352349966259.gif
<flutterchu> Annoying Orange is annoying, but he's orange and orange is my least favorite color, so that makes him special, in a bood way
<thelonepony> for the station i mean
<AttackWithHugs> Annoying Orange shouldn't even had a YouTube series, IMO
<AttackWithHugs> CrimsonPhoenix, a fish man?
<JRP> The point is its supposed time be annoying
<AJIsAwesome> Is that FRED show still on Nick?
<JRP> The*
<Wrek> 05"annoying orange is so annoying"
<Wrek> 05JOB WELL DONE!
<flutterchu> \/
<Tovler> Problem Solverz is the worst
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: not sure, brb
*JRP is strating to really hate his autocorrect
<Derpy_Hooves> Tovler: problem solvers is a good acid substitute
<flutterchu> \/ V v ᵛ
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: Hasn't that show been cancelled for a long time?
<AttackWithHugs> Wrek, I wish that show hasn't even been existed. Deserves to be in the sun, I think
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: Yeah, it was a pretty trippy show, to be honest. :S
<Tovler> lawl 2.2/10 on imdb
<thelonepony> back and no but only re-runs ayejay
<JRP> Annoying orange is Luke a 10 year-old either after effects

<Vordox> oH MAI
<thelonepony> Hi valoreins :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, valoreins. :)
<AttackWithHugs> Hey valoreins
<flutterchu> Hoy valoreins

<Kandarihu> Er, it's been streamless for long periods of time
<otakon> Wrek: yeah there is a lot of downtime since you stopped streaming, not saying the other streamers do not do their part.
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: Nuuu, my innocence.

<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Wow.
<Vordox> Wrek: Well you ARE a Swede
<Meanwhile> Obviously, just now there's less of them.
<Vordox> Most other streamers are either UK or USA
<otakon> Wrek: huh? then what are you saying?
<Vordox> So yep. :P
<Wrek> 05otakon: " not saying the other streamers do not do their part."

<AJIsAwesome> RaveBrony: Artist known for NSFW.
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<OtakuTom> No stream right now?
<AJIsAwesome> nope
<SpeccyRush> by the way the correct albeit still wrong answer because posting nsfw anything is against the rules period was 'I it streamed, ithought it was considered ok' which is still the wrong answer

<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 2 days, 3 hours, 59 minutes, 9 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<Jake> Ahh better
<AdamTheDuck> Jake, it's not going to come any quicker no matter how many times you !cd
<Gold_Demona> Maybe I need to upgrade my PC... I can only get up to 70
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, 70 is fine.
<Gold_Demona> And that if it's behaving. It's kind of old and running kinda slow now.
<Jake> I had a mssive ping timeout and my client shut down before I got the message
<AdamTheDuck> No point having 200 fps
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I named my female Gligar after you because you're awesome :D (and Gligar kinda looks like a gargoyle)
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL, I'm flattered. :D
<AdamTheDuck> Your eyes can only detect to a certain amount anyway, can't remember exactly what
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Just faced 2 axis troopers with rifles i killed both with just a pistol :O
<Jake> Somewhat around 30 fps
<JRP2234> Phase4 on the dreamcast cpu it says potato
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: seen 278 mons, caught 150
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Awesome. =)
<Jake> Ok and bai again
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I also hope I don't sound boring :D
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, pfft, you're not a man untill you knifed 2 scouts and desecrated their corpes with the age old action of tea bagging.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No way. I like hearing your latest adventures in pokemon. :)
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Hey i'm a veteran to the game so meh i have done my share of crazy things in that game :P'
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, XD
<Gold_Demona> As have I
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I got a lot of evolutions, and I still haven't used the breeding thing :|
<Gold_Demona> I'm old enough to remember the missingno glitch.
<Jmo> >.>
<Jmo> It isn't that old
<Jmo> Only like 8-10 years old :<
<AdamTheDuck> "only"
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Not everyone has played pokemon that long tho. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Missingno is one of the best glitches in gaming history
<Gold_Demona> indeed
<Gold_Demona> Missingno glitch is best glitch
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/297/5/f/tank_beats_everything_by_j_z_a-d5ivc17.png
<Gold_Demona> LOL
<Gold_Demona> Derpy WOULD have missingno
<Moopy> Ten million fluttershy's
<Gold_Demona> I also really liked missingno's cousin ~~M~~
<Phase4> someone went through and reverse engineered how missingno works
<Gold_Demona> Which is level 0 and when you level it up it evolves into Kangaskahn
<Gold_Demona> Isn't it a bonus pokemon that was removed but not completely?
<Phase4> i should go through and find that
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, nah, junk data
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Phase4> as are most of misingno's 'cousins'
<AdamTheDuck> Well there is the Lavender Town theory
<Phase4> some are trainers improperly interpreted as pokemon
<AdamTheDuck> which was a waste of 10 minutes of my life
<Gold_Demona> Interesting that missingno only appears after talking to the dude in Viridian that's had too much coffee. :P
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, thats quite interesting, wana know how it works?
<Gold_Demona> Sure, why not?
*AdamTheDuck pokes the campfire
<Phase4> each 'map' has a bit of data that defines what pokemon can appear
<Phase4> and at what level
<AdamTheDuck> Yay a Phase4 story telling time
*AdamTheDuck passes the marshmallows around
<Phase4> when you walk around, you cross 'load lines' that update this info
<Phase4> as well as other stuff, like loading data
<Phase4> cinibar island has no load lines
<Phase4> the edge of the map is marked for random encounters but theres no data
<Gold_Demona> heh!
<Phase4> normally not a problem, when you swim there you cross lines anyway
<Phase4> when you fly, you dont cross load lines
<Phase4> now, after this round i'll finish
<Phase4> nvm, finish while map loads
<Phase4> when you talk to the training guy, his name
<Phase4> has to be placed where your name is
<Phase4> your name has to be placed somewhere
<MadSurge> Also the old man "borrows" the protagonist's sprite
<Phase4> just so happens that it uses the same area where pokemon data is stored
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Sumica
<Phase4> so what missingno's appear is defined by your name
<Gold_Demona> Heh!
<Gold_Demona> So is this also what makes different level 100 pokemon appear there?
<Gold_Demona> How everybody gets something different?
<Gold_Demona> I always got lvl 100 electrodes
<Phase4> defined by your name
<Gold_Demona> My one friend got a snorlax that knew fly
<Phase4> someone had the tables but i cant get them anymore :(
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's your own glitched pokemon :3
<Phase4> site wen toffline
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, what is particuarly interesting is the 'canonical' missingno
<Phase4> it just so happens to appear because of the 'end of name' character
<Jmo> Alright, false alarm on the Telstra thing, I'm a retard. You can all hit me if you wish.
<Phase4> the default names, unlike custom names, dont have null characters in unused spaces
<Phase4> instead its filled with end of name characters
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo instead :3
<Phase4> hence why that missingno is so common
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Gold_Demona> That's fascinating
<AdamTheDuck> Needs more Scootaloo
<MadSurge> Another common missingno is the "female" one, that has an infinite and hideous cry
<Gold_Demona> female one?
<Gold_Demona> But first gen had no genders
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God
<AdamTheDuck> infinite cry
<Sumica> 00,10I am enjoying this game far too much
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: its name is just the female simbol
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, which game?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ah

<Sumica> 00,10also has the dude and the jesus
<XAX> Ohdasrai. MLP gaem on the iDevice. I'll have to go look for that.
<Gold_Demona> I'd like to think Time Turner is his "regular pony name". Like how John Smith is the Doctor's "regular human name".
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: It's so good ;_; but there's a VERY small amount of servers left now. Don't bother getting it.
<Phase4> i need a server like this one in aus
<CrimsonPhoenix> URGGGH You guys are impossible
<Phase4> CrimsonPhoenix, ?
<Sumica> 00,10Guess i better set up that ide thing so we can shre shit eh?
<AdamTheDuck> XAX, yeah, that's what put me off buying it.
<Jmo> Lawl.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Eyup
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, fanon vs canon stuff
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also can't reall advance a lot of "quest" without it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> really
<CrimsonPhoenix> and how people will do ANYTHING to get their fanon facts believable when anything related to the show suggest otherwise
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: When I say VERY small amount of servers, I mean about... 7?
<CrimsonPhoenix> see DJ-PON3 wearing contact lenses excuse
<Gold_Demona> dangit, hit the wrong button.
<AdamTheDuck> XAX, oh my...
*AdamTheDuck still awaits a Battlefield 2143...
<MadSurge> Egh, I guess the Gameloft game still not available on mobile
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, I don't think it will
<Sumica> 00,10Ok done, chace_sumica
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, theres also a good explination of the glitch city bug
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: It's rather sad, really. It was an amazing game.
<XAX> Phase4: We Pokemon now?
<Phase4> XAX, ?
<XAX> Phase4: There's a Glitch City in pokemon R/B/Y. Is that what you meant? :p

<XAX> Phase4: Heh. I'm actually playing back through my Red. I've been asking people here to name my party. I'll come to you for a name once ive decided on my next party member because I'm an indecisive fuck.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well at least i think is done
<Phase4> i should stream pokemon some time
<Phase4> do a few bugs too
<Phase4> problem with emulators though is the unimplimented instructions
<XAX> Phase4: CATCH MISSINGNO.

<Phase4> and unlike the nes no documentation exists
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352373752923.jpg end of season 4
<XAX> Phase4: I wonder how KH2FM would run on the emulator I have with FMLE running...
<AdamTheDuck> Instructions Phase4? .-.

*Bronysith glomps Phase4 ontop of Sumica
<Phase4> ah
*Phase4 hugs Bronysith and Sumica back
<Sumica> 00,10so the best way to make bits is to have as many shops as you can
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica dunno i have found 4 in a row
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hai everypony :3
<Sumica> 00,10and it seems the productions on shops keep going and just pile up waiting for you
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352348194258.png
<Bronysith> only on 4chan
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm starting to question my eyesight
<Spell-of-Gaming> Or my dad, apparently.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i just put the lemon stand 3 ponies 203 bits every 4m 30 s
<Ponies47> Good morning :3

<Sumica> 00,10you are loseing out TheGreatAndPowerfulT or you typoed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i'm takin in consideration that if i use severl shops i have to time every single one
<Sumica> 00,10it seems to cary over production
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not really
<Sumica> 00,10as in you dont lose out if you dont gather
<Eulshy> Hi
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if thats true the indeed having severl shops s the best choice
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: how much is this app anyways?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> free with in app purchases
<Bronysith> of course...
<Bronysith> and the name of said app?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> pretty much like any facebook game
<Spell-of-Gaming> Freenium, as they say.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Bronysith My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic
<Bronysith> so its just like any other facebook game, but with ponies?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> let me check if you seriously don't lose if you don't gather
<Spell-of-Gaming> Buying bits can cost up to 100 bucks
<Spell-of-Gaming> That's Gameloft for you
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol they will never see a cent from me
<Spell-of-Gaming> Okay, what?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I think I found a fake article
<Spell-of-Gaming> Not from The Onion
<Spell-of-Gaming> "iPad 4 crushes PS Vita in graphics performance"
<Spell-of-Gaming> You must be kidding
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica my shops seems to stop producing until i gather
<Sumica> 00,10ah
<Spell-of-Gaming> If that's true, we should've already has a PSP emulator for iOS now.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so yeah if they do that i rather just keep my lemon stand
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> when i can check it every 5 minutes
<Sumica> 00,10so longer timers are better for less activity
<Spell-of-Gaming> Someone is developing a PSP emulator for Android, BTw.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> pretty much
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> longer timer = more money if you don't have the time to keep checking the app
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wooo Braeburn

<Ponies47> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, :/
<Bronysith> it is a natural ingredient found in the human body to help you go to sleep TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: over the counter, get either a 3mg or 5mg and you will be able to naturally fall asleep
<Bronysith> it is not a sleeping pill, just an aid
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> maybe will try it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ponies47 also the most time i been without sleep it's been 3 days
<Ponies47> o_o
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yea go ahead and get 5mg

<DSHooves> Thanks!
<Ponies47> DSHooves, Your art is kewl. So I'm watching you on DA nos :P

<DSHooves> Bathing on the other hand, depending on the child's age, is difficult.

<Ponies47> I'm terrible with kids.
<MadSurge> Toys at least can distract them
<Jmo|Zzz> You are a kid, therefore you're terrible with yourse.f
<Jmo|Zzz> yourself

<MadSurge> Jaymoo plz

<Ponies47> I have to deal with a 4 year old, 3 year old, and idk how old the other one is cousins. It's chaos and drives me nuts ._.
<MadSurge> Is that some medicine? :D

<Jmo> Yep
<Vivix> Heelloooo brooonyystaaaate~~
<MadSurge> :$ hello Vivix!
<Ponies47> Hi Vivix
<Vivix> Hiya MadSurge and Ponies47 :3
<Sylandest> howdy Vivix
<Vivix> and Southern-horse, hii
<Sylandest> I am actually southern :D
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> it's strange how close to southern horse your name sound- everytime I see you I think about it
<Sylandest> You see me all the time, Vivix? 6_9
<Vivix> I see you now and again here yeah
<Sylandest> I do hop in and out, hehe. Usually in my mornings, and maybe during the afternoons
<Vivix> Yeah pretty much same here, tend to hop out around evening time
<Jmo> o.o
<MadSurge> I drop out only to sleep :D
<Ponies47> I hop on before school and then usually I'm on for the rest of the time I'm awake after school
<MadSurge> 'tis a pretty swell place :3
<Ponies47> mmmhm ^^
<Vivix> That it is, I kinda like the calm periods the best though
<Sylandest> eeeyup
<Sylandest> Need them calm periods since my days can be chaotic
<MadSurge> Orly? Why?
<Jmo> DISCORD ALL OVER.
<Sylandest> MadSurge: school makes it hard to have time to relax, hehe
<MadSurge> Sylandest: Ah yes, unlike me and my lazy lazy ass demeanor :D
<Sylandest> I've got two sociology exams tomorrow, and today, I have a presentation on the Sociosymbolism of family in Death of a Salesman
<Vivix> Ooh~~
<Vivix> That sounds interesting
<MadSurge> :O
<Vivix> I didn't like socialstudies when I was in school, but- it sounds kinde nice now that I'm older
<MadSurge> Sylandest: who wrote Death of a Salesman?
<Sylandest> I basically have to present how Willy Loman and Linda Loman represented different aspects of family via their character in the play.
<Sylandest> MadSurge: ...I actually forgot. Un momento.
<Ponies47> I hate all subjects in school ._.
<Vivix> Aww
<Jmo> You hate school.
<MadSurge> ^
<Sylandest> MadSurge: Arthur Miller
<Vivix> I actually liked History, Math, art history, art and eh..chemistry/science
<MadSurge> Hmm, never heard of him. Time to wiki I guess
<Ponies47> Yup. Hate it to death. It's frustrating and depressing .-.
<Vivix> Heart about him, but we had more abot authors like-- Henrik Ibsen and such in symbolism and literature thing
<Jmo> 'depressing'
<Vivix> Oh I loved "Norsk"--literature and essays
<Vivix> I liked school- we could get away with so much and just hang out and do school things all day
<Sylandest> ^
<Sylandest> Still do. kinda.
<Sylandest> I remember me and my roommate were bored one day, so he and I took the freezer's ice shavings from his fridge and mine, and we built a mini snowman. Posted it in the dorm's front lobby
<Sylandest> Folk loved it.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Nice
<Sylandest> But it melted in like an hour ;-;
<Ponies47> There is nothing fun about school. Well maybe it's because I hang out by myself and don't have any friends. .-.
<Vivix> AWw- yeah
<Vivix> you need someone to have fun with to enjoy it I guess
<Jmo> You know what I loved in school?
<Jmo> Screwing with the IT department.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> When we were kids we were the only nerds in school
<Jmo> Oh what I did to their computers in the library.
<Vivix> this was like...1998 I guess, so we'd change splashscreens- mess with the autoexec.bat- stuff like that
<Jmo> The guy was cool though
<Ponies47> I couldn't make in friends in middle school and it appears the same is happening for high school. :/
<Jmo> Friends are over-rated.
<Jmo> :>
<MadSurge> Italian literature is filled with different authors, and we get people like Carlo Goldoni and Luigi Pirandello in theater
<Vivix> ahh- I suck at making friends, but like in college,orwhatyoucallit, people were really nice to me and I had my little group of people I talked to
<Jmo> Vivix you had no friends.
<Vivix> ;__; I did tooo~~
<Jmo> Just imagine if I went to your college
<Jmo> Be picking on you all the time.
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> ONe day I'd just lock myself in the cabinet and cry
<Jmo> You would.
<Ponies47> Well I realized the same already has happened. I'm gonna be alone in high school with no friends. :I
<Jmo> Isn't it the law to finish high school at year 12 or are you allowed to drop for a job at 10?
*Ponies47 Shrugs
<Jmo> Thank you ponies >_>
<Sylandest> lemme think
<Vivix> We can drop out at year..11 I think
<Sylandest> ^ maybe
<Jmo> Lul
<Vivix> like 0 jobs, but--we can
<Sylandest> The circumstances are different based on the state
<Jezebel> what day is it today?

<MadSurge> I dunno if they planned that
<Jmo> Only 10 episodes. Lul
<MadSurge> Ah, well

<Vivix> we'll see~~
<Sylandest> Vivix: why hide from chat?
<Vivix> I'll be so super hyper excited about it
<Jezebel> :) you can't do that

*Vivix canonizes Jmo
<Sylandest> One more to add to my list of apparent shippings
<Jmo> with wat.
<Vivix> hehe
<Jmo> What am I canon for?
<Vivix> Canonize: officially declare (a dead person) to be a saint:
<Jmo> WAT?
<Vivix> :3
*Vivix nerds out
<Vivix> canon--comes from "Authorative" or something- canonize is to make something authorative, especially in regards to the catholic church
<Vivix> so declare a saint- a sanction- things like that
<Vivix> so canon is like the authorative source or collective works of information or sometihng
*Vivix useless fact of the day #1

<Jmo> On the legs, is that suppose to be skin colour or shadows?
<MaxTheBrony> shadows
<MaxTheBrony> i may have to smooth it
<MaxTheBrony> some
<Jmo> Previous pose was better, shadowing is off abit
<Jmo> Doesn't look correct
<MaxTheBrony> I personaly like the new pose better, but do you think i should fix the shadows ? If so How?
<Jmo> Well mainly the front legs shadowing looks off.

<MaxTheBrony> Thank you Flutterfan1 :)
<Vivix> I like it, especially the tail is kinda sexy
<Jmo> oh my god Vivix.
<Vivix> but the shadow is a bit strong for that background light-
<Jmo> The shadowing.
<Jmo> ff
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<MaxTheBrony> Im not sure what i should have in bg
<Vivix> see how the light hits him on the face? but the groundshadow goes--down, rather than follow that direction
<Flutterfan1> MaxTheBrony: Your welcome my friend ;)
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Jmo> What Vivix said.
<Jmo> The background should be like ruins, ancient old mayan like ruins
<Jmo> or something of the sort
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah i have been thinking that aswell :)
<GamerCherry> MaxTheBrony: From Sweden?
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah

<MaxTheBrony> one above the head
<MaxTheBrony> in front

<MaxTheBrony> Yeah i like the "nose" :D but hmm
<MaxTheBrony> how should i do it
<Jmo> You throw your tablet outside and never draw again.

<RaveBrony> Everlasting_Joy: Parents will be all "Wtf" and i just pick up my pony stuff, smile at them ,and leave :D
<Sick_icybeauti> jinx...
<Vivix> S4 was confirmed, s5 was rumoured
<HoodyNinja> prince-dari: I'm willing to bet on that
<Rainboom> If MLP FiM was cancelled just after S3 I will die alone
<Bronysith> Rainboom: cheaper caskets
<Everlasting_Joy> RaveBrony: :D Aww yeah!
<prince-dari> I totally hope it does get cancelled.
<[Alpha]> Murder....wait what
<Sick_icybeauti> My world would be empty if the show ended after the season ended.
<prince-dari> So many delicious tears.
<RaveBrony> Then Man Up Hammer?
<Sick_icybeauti> BTW, I got aerosmith's new album!!!

<prince-dari> DaringDerpy: It won't
<Moopy> umm tom its in maybe 3 or 2 days dude
<RaveBrony> Hah
<prince-dari> It's just a TV show, and it has to end some time.
<[Alpha]> prince-dari you are such a troll
<Jmo> lol troll
<prince-dari> It might be a pretty good TV show, but that's still all it is.
<Jmo> he ain't even
<Vivix> Moopy 1 day 20 hours
<Rainboom> I would probably think it would come back on due to popular command if it got cancelled
<DaringDerpy> sure it will end...or turn into another generic show...at season 6 or so...
<Sick_icybeauti> Trolllling...Trolling......Trolling down a river.
<BlazeAngel> prince-dari: When it does, most bronies will wait for G5. I will stay here. Will you?
<Ryunosuke> prince-dari, how could you be so heartless? :)
<Rainboom> they see me trolling, they hatin'
<Vivix> my guess is S5 will be the last
<RaveBrony> As much as I love the show and the community... NOTHING will make me as upset as Inuyasha ending, lmao

<RaveBrony> ._.
<DaringDerpy> Vivix: I've seen other communities die before...30k unique users a day...10 years later every two months a forum post "what happened to this place"...the rest is ruins...incomplete projects
<DashWithRainbows> Dari Meh, I wouldn't mind coming back now.
<HoodyNinja> Dr who came before that iirc
<RaveBrony> I like Dr. Who!! D:
<Dark_Horst> HoodyNinja: i think he'S aware of that
<RaveBrony> Well...i liked that one actor guy
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: rejoin, there is plenty of fresh meat
<Vivix> DaringDerpy, oh yeah, this place will die eventually. When MLP eventually ends I probably won't be heeere anymore
<RaveBrony> Not to crazy about the others :(
<DashWithRainbows> Well
<[Alpha]> Dr.who started I the 1960s
<Sick_icybeauti> Imagine it would be like 10 years after the show ends, and we could have a reunion....That would kick some ass.
<[Alpha]> In
<DashWithRainbows> The only way I can rejoin is via invite.
<Everlasting_Joy> Wait, is NewSuperBronyU trying to rustle and counter troll prince-dari?
<prince-dari> I can't, you're not in my friends list
<prince-dari> :P
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02My sister is the only one obsessed with Dr. Who here. She went out of her way to paint the door to her room as the blue police box from the show.
<DaringDerpy> I never met a irl brony
<[Alpha]> xD
<BlazeAngel> NewSuperBronyU, lemme tell you a secret about this place. When G4 dies, this place will almost definetly die too. There will pobobly be 30 or so people left. I will be here. I will help mold the site into something new. It will not be forgotten. *Sparten battle cry* But for now... Lets enjoy it. :3
<Jmo> Ohhhhhh
<HoodyNinja> Everlasting_Joy: Succeeding*
<DaringDerpy> should do that before the show ends
<Sick_icybeauti> NewSuperBronyU: That's HXC

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02prince-dari is mah friend i would never hurt him ;3;
<BlazeAngel> RaveBrony... :(
<[Alpha]> I find it interesting but not something to obsess over
<Sick_icybeauti> That 105 isn't even talking...It's like maybe 50 of us talking ATM
<DashWithRainbows> Dari You know I would probably spam you pictures of Matt Smith if I was on your friends list.
<HoodyNinja> Less than that
<DashWithRainbows> You'd probably send me spider links.
<HoodyNinja> about 20
<prince-dari> And I you with spiders and
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> weta
<DaringDerpy> RaveBrony: I enjoy the chaos of huge chat groups...if you get to know everyone and his quirks, things become repetitive

<Jmo> Panda
*thelonepony hugs MadSurge and Invi :3
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix: I guess i can just save the Image in Tga and upload it and delete the Image*

*BlazeAngel dirties Socks
<Socks> Oi!
<BlazeAngel> :3
<Panda> bmp? who uses that?
*thelonepony hugs Socks again :3
<Vivix> bmp is pretty bad, but it is lossless
<BlazeAngel> Yayayayayayaya
<Shizuka> 13ys
<Socks> I fully expect BronyState servers to crash on Nov. 10 as the majority of Europe have no where else to see it.
<shana> png is also lossless Vivix
<Vivix> all the time?
<Shizuka> 13but seriously bmp has massive overhead
<Vivix> Max was getting compression artifact, and I think that was png 24
<Panda> jpeg is best format?
<MaxTheBrony> That was a jpeg*
<Vivix> oh okay
<MaxTheBrony> I had converted it wrong
<MaxTheBrony> or saved*
<Vivix> alright, but yeah I prefer png

<BlazeAngel> Mine would be a blank flank.
<Emil> Socks: I'm working on it.
<Emil> Socks: If I feel productive some day.
<thelonepony> BlazeAngel: maybe a Angel set to blaze :PP
<Socks> I'd probably be a blank flank ATM :/
<Socks> Emil: :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> wrench, or something else related to engineering :3
<thelonepony> not sure about my cutie mark :/
<Socks> MLP_Brovakiin: The only thing I know about engineering is that they believe the glass to be twice as big as it needs to be :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> I don't get the reference, but oh well :p
<Socks> MLP_Brovakiin: Optimists believe the glass is half full, Pessamists think it's half empty and engineers think that the glass is twice as big as it needs to be...

<KandarihuFastBreak18> My mom's laptop cost $500 and has been a decent computer for me, as long as I turn the settings down to minimum on everything. But I'm really used to doing that on my older computers
<Barb|AtWork> Might look into that one company Steam advertises all the time
<Barb|AtWork> Or used too.
<Barb|AtWork> Falcon something or another.
<Vivix> everytime I read falcon I see foalcon
<Vivix> damnit internet
<Jmo> So wait what was your reason? I got kicked before I saw it.
<Vivix> I have an asus laptop, but I only use it for typing
<Socks> I liked it when Falcon produced drinks
<Rainboom> Me: I wasn't watching ponies! Friend: Then how do you know I blocked them? Me: I know, cus I dont know! Thats what im saying! God..
<KandarihuFastBreak18> Socks, did that really happen to Gabe Newell?
<Socks> KandarihuFastBreak18: Apparntly, I'd like to think so :D
<KandarihuFastBreak18> That should totally happen.
<Vivix> I wonder what they'll do after half life
<Vivix> They were talkiong about "something that will change multiplayer forever"
<ekips> Vivix Quarter Life
<Vivix> Hehe
<pony_4792> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 1 days, 18 hours, 11 minutes, 56 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<Vivix> soon one day
<KandarihuFastBreak18> A new IP, then?
<Vivix> Who knows- probably
<Vivix> I hope they don't go too avant garde
<Vivix> but- interesting to see what happens in the future
<KandarihuFastBreak18> An interesting new game which will spawn a sequel that perfects the idea, and we hold our breath forever on a 3rd installment that never even gets announced?
<Vivix> yep
<Vivix> maybe it'll be usper meta
<Vivix> and the game IS waiting
<Vivix> the last person to disconnect wins something
<Vivix> a message- a game- abook, something exclusive
<Vivix> I'd---love that
<Aeolic|AtWork> Hey, everypony.
<MadSurge> Hi Aeolic|AtWork!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Aeolic|AtWork :)
<thelonepony> Hi Aeolic|AtWork :)
<Aeolic|AtWork> :D
<Gekoncze> hi
<alexxm> dinner back soon
<Vivix> When indie started fleeting into movie industry, we got art-house and avant-garde
<Vivix> now that indie is going into game- we need it there too
<Socks> ^
<Socks> Re-Watching DBZ atm, ye gods it's CHeesy :D
<Sick_icybeauti> Help me...I gotta write an essay, and it's goign on a website that checks for copying..HSLP!
<Sick_icybeauti> HALP!*
<Vivix> don't copy, problem solved
<alexxm> back
<Sick_icybeauti> But the way it's goign to be written is goign to ake them think I copied...
<thelonepony> wb alexxm :)
<Vivix> read, think and experiment, if you get interested in the subject it will write itself
<Panda|Drawing> Sick_icybeauti, whats the subject and I assume the website used is called "Turn it in"
<Sick_icybeauti> Panda|Drawing: Wyup...
<Sick_icybeauti> Eyup*
<Panda|Drawing> Sick_icybeauti, whats the subject.
<alexxm> thanks thelonepony how've you been
<ekips> Sick_icybeauti it's not enough that they "think" it's copied. They must have proof
<Vivix> ooh style is dubious? That's a hard one- provide TONS of sources?
*Socks hugstabs alexxm
<Sick_icybeauti> It's an essay about Johann sebastian bach (It's for a music class)
*thelonepony stabs and burns Socks :I
<Shizuka> 13what about him?
<Shizuka> 13just... about him?
<Socks> }:-)
<Shizuka> 13cause if so you should tell them that's a BS assignment
*alexxm puts Socks in the naughty corner
*Vivix had many assignments like that
<Panda|Drawing> like a bio Sick_icybeauti?
<Sick_icybeauti> The intor is suppsoe to be a sort of "biography" then you go inot detail about how his music influenced shit.
<Sick_icybeauti> intro*
<Socks> WHose music?
<Vivix> Bach
<Saturn> 08,01i regularly poop to bach
<Shizuka> 13oh whose music
<Panda|Drawing> Sick_icybeauti, ah. ^^ well just research who his influecnes were and who was influenced by him.
<Sick_icybeauti> Johann sbastian Bach
<Shizuka> 13cause anyway
<Socks> I like Bach ^_^
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn O-o
<Shizuka> 13just google "influence of bach on modern music"
<AttackWithHugs|AFK> Uh
<Shizuka> 13pick three examples
<ekips> Saturn That's..nice, I guess
<Sick_icybeauti> I've played his stuff sicne like 3rd grade...Gawd.
<Shizuka> 13BS at length on them
<Socks> Baby got Bach :D
<Sick_icybeauti> 4 muthafucking paragraphs :(
<Saturn> 08,01Sick_icybeauti: wow, heavy man
<Vivix> if you do that you deserve an F
<Shizuka> 13wait you only have to do four paragraphs? what kind of essay is this...
<Panda|Drawing> Sick_icybeauti, make sure that they arent blogs or anything like that.
<Panda|Drawing> Wait... are you in college or highschool?
<ekips> Saturn I see through your sarcasm
<Sick_icybeauti> I have wikipedia....Might be enough...
<Panda|Drawing> ...
<Shizuka> 13bitch i did eight pages about DNS resolution using nothing more than one class on ARP
<Panda|Drawing> must be highschool
<Sick_icybeauti> Panda|Drawing: High school
<Vivix> Some schools won't let you use wiki as source
<kidzrul732> hey bronies I was playing the new MLP app and guess what i found!
<Socks> Sick_icybeauti: 4 paragraphs isn't a hard essay... it's not even an essay
<Panda|Drawing> ...
<Panda|Drawing> yeah its not
<kidzrul732> They didn't have derpy in it!
<ekips> I always use the sources given on the wikipedia page
<Socks> Sick_icybeauti: Wikipedia is generally good, just don't quote it as a source.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic Variant for Issue #2- Midtown Comics
<Sick_icybeauti> Whatever, in high school sense (I know college length, I have abrother.)
<Panda|Drawing> I just had to do a 10 page research assignment on the effects certain genres of music have on productivity... 4 paragraphs isnt really much of a hard paper.
<Panda|Drawing> and I advise that you dont use wikipedia as your central information site.
<Saturn> 08,014 paragraphs is what... 3/4 of a page?
<Panda|Drawing> ^
<Vivix> less I think
<Socks> ^^
<Shizuka> 13pretty much
<Saturn> 08,01that's like 800 words, man
<Shizuka> 13depends on how much overhead you devote to name, class, date, title :3
<Socks> Panda|Drawing: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ so much!
<Vivix> my paragraphs are usually short, so 500 words that would be
<Saturn> 08,01you can rattle that off in 10 minutes
<Panda|Drawing> Socks huh?
<Socks> :P
<Vivix> I haven't done a paper in years and years and years-
<Panda|Drawing> Sick_icybeauti, google what Shizuka said and thats alread enough for at least 10 paragraphs. and just do a brief bio...
<Vivix> I miss it~~
<Jmo> Vivix, you're the geek who loves homework.
<Sick_icybeauti> Needs to be 2 pages
*Vivix didn't do homework
<Jmo> LIAR.
<Panda|Drawing> 2 pages....
<Socks> :D
<Jmo> PURE LIES.
<Vivix> but IN school, it was fun to do interesting things
<Vivix> I didn't do homework since grade 10 I think
<MadSurge> ^
<Panda|Drawing> ...
<Panda|Drawing> go to school Vivix
<Socks> What is grade 10 in english years?
<Panda|Drawing> xD
<Jmo> lOL
<Shizuka> 13just use wiki
<Vivix> I will return to school once
<Kammerjunk> I don't do homework, I just do it at school.
<Shizuka> 13pick out the important details
<Vivix> I want to do accounting or psychology
<Shizuka> 13then describe them your own way
<Panda|Drawing> Vivix PICK PSYCHOLOGY!
<Vivix> describe your understanding of them
<Vivix> don't rewrite bullshit you don't udnerstand
<ekips> 10 was the grade my motivation left me completely :/
<Socks> ^^
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Vicis> Hello?
<Vivix> I want to do zoology and psychology, but no jobs- so..hobby?
<ekips> ohai Vicis
<thelonepony> hi Vicis :)
<Vivix> Accounting might get you an ok job
<Sick_icybeauti> Thankies. :3. It sucks what education has come too...Just preparing for a test...I find it depressing when the teachers say "The regents will have this" or "the regents have that" We're not learning...We're test preping...
<Vicis> Hello thanks for the warm welcome
<Kammerjunk> Really? After primary school (Well, after ten years, I don't know what that amount to other places), I was excited.
<Shizuka> 13oo not even american huh
*Socks hugs Vicis
<Kammerjunk> Hell, I'm even more excited for uni.
<Vivix> brb darlings~~
<Vicis> so is there anything playing for any one?
<Kammerjunk> Eenope.
<Panda|Drawing> nope
<Vicis> *Smiles at socks for the hug*
<thelonepony> nope
<Vicis> okay thanks. just wanted to know if it was something on my end
<Sick_icybeauti> I mgiht as well star now....I'll take breaks.
<Panda|Drawing> you should be able to squirt it out in less than an hour ^^
<Kammerjunk> Am I the only one who gets more excited for each level of education?
<Jmo> I think you are.
<Panda|Drawing> Kammerjunk, nope, me to actually.
<Sick_icybeauti> Kammerjunk: Seems like it. You must go to a good school.
<Socks> No, it's just each level of education is worse than the last.
<Panda|Drawing> too*
<Jmo> jesus christ pondoo.
*Socks has not had good school experiances
<Panda|Drawing> Nah, when you get to Uni, thats when the fun starts ^^
<Kammerjunk> I think whatever you silly fillies call what's after ten years of school is great, and uni will be even better.
*Invi looks into the chat and sees this out of context: ''<Panda|Drawing> you should be able to squirt it out in less than an hour ^^''
<Sick_icybeauti> I can't believe I hate education when in the middle easty, people get killed trying to go to school....
<Kammerjunk> (We call it gymnasium)
<Jmo> WTF?
<Panda|Drawing> Invi whoops >.>
<Invi> xD
<Socks> Invi: :D
<Kammerjunk> Invi: That's exactly what you think it is.
<Sick_icybeauti> Gym lol
<Panda|Drawing> oh shit XD
<Invi> it is? nice
<Socks> Out of context? is it not clear?
<Jmo> Yeah that's my sign to go to sleep.
<Kammerjunk> Sick_icybeauti: Yeah, gymnasium has a different meaning over here.
<Vicis> bye all thanks for the warm welcome. and if anyone got the reference with my name then u are awesome!
<Panda|Drawing> night night jaymoo ^^
<Invi> nighty Jmo|Zzz
<thelonepony> Night Jaymoo :3
<Panda|Drawing> Vicis, pokemon?
<Kammerjunk> Valedico, Jmo et Vicis.
<Vivix> bk
<Jmo|Zzz> wat.
<Kammerjunk> Yes..
<Jmo|Zzz> WTB ENGLISH.
<Kammerjunk> goddammitdoublefullstop
*Invi sells Jmo|Zzz english but with bad grammar
<Panda|Drawing> so.... the doctors is on...
<Vicis> No Vicis is from an MLP FIM Game. go check it out on FB if you can
<Kammerjunk> Jmo|Zzz: It means bye. Now go to bread.
<Vicis> or just google it.
<Vicis> bye
<Panda|Drawing> o/
<Jmo|Zzz> I'll do wut I want fewl.
<Jmo|Zzz> :>
*Socks stabs Jmo|Zzz in his sleep
<Vicis> kk
<Vivix> baacksies
<Kammerjunk> Go to bread, ya featherbrain.
<Invi> so, vicis came just on to say us we should google the nameß
<Panda|Drawing> ...
<Panda|Drawing> yup
<Kammerjunk> More or less.
<Serenity> Hey everypony
*Invi shrugs
<Kammerjunk> Heus, Serenity.
<Serenity> Some fucker just tried to break into my home...
*Panda|Drawing shrugs at Invi
<thelonepony> Hi Serenity :)
<Panda|Drawing> Serenity was it pinkie?
<Shizuka> 13did you shoot them?
<Kammerjunk> Serenity: Oh? Unsuccessfully, I take it.
<Serenity> Shizuka: They got away before hand
<Sick_icybeauti> Double spaced...HAHA!
<Panda|Drawing> ...
*Vivix rolls everything
<Serenity> Kammerjunk: Yeah, they had a crowbar, but I had a gun
<Panda|Drawing> Sick_icybeauti, I assume MLA formatting?
<Kammerjunk> Serenity: I like those odds.
<Serenity> A big gun
<Sick_icybeauti> Panda|Drawing: 12 sized font, black, double spaced.....
<Panda|Drawing> inb4 Serenity flexs
<Shizuka> 13paragraph requirement or page requirement?
<Serenity> So yeah, guess who has to call to get their double glazing window fixed
<Shizuka> 13cause double spacing halves the amount of work you have to do
<Panda|Drawing> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Kammerjunk> We just get a set amount of words to write.
<Vivix> That's why word requirement is best
<Sick_icybeauti> And making the punctiation bigger.
<Panda|Drawing> also
<Vivix> 2000 word minimum! NAO
<Serenity> Yeah but can't you tell the amount of spaces easily
<Panda|Drawing> are you double spacing after each period?
<Serenity> I double spaced the first 4 words
<Buytoast> if you aren't using 72 bold comic sans with double spacing, you aren't writing your paper correctly
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Buytoast> with 5 inch margins
<Serenity> Anyway, I think a new window will cost me a few hundred
<Serenity> That goes out of my laptop funds
<Sick_icybeauti> Buytoast: LOL
<Kammerjunk> Serenity: Oh, that sucks.
<Serenity> Yeah, atm that means I can't afford the laptop, because I'm 200 short
<Sick_icybeauti> Hey, there isn't a requirement to what type of font you can use.
<Buytoast> not when you go to renegade high there isn't
<Panda|Drawing> Sick_icybeauti, then use arial size 10
<Michael> ohai everypony!
<Kammerjunk> Sick_icybeauti: We're just told to use what our teacher calls "antikva" (in Danish, not sure what the English word for it is). Basically, any font with footing.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Michael.
<Sick_icybeauti> It needs to be size 12, but I don't see what tupe of font.
<Vivix> do you get word requirement in denmark? We always got page during my schooldays-
<thelonepony> Hi Michael :)
<Sick_icybeauti> type...Mother of jesus, I hope I don't spell like this on the paper...
<Buytoast> you should use size 12 wingdings
<Buytoast> that'll make you look exotic
<Panda|Drawing> xD
*Michael hugs Kammerjunk thelonepony
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: Really? We only get word requirements on written assignments.
*thelonepony noms on Michael :3
<Kammerjunk> Welp, AFK.
<Vivix> Huh-
<Vivix> Well maybe I'd get the same if I went to higher education
*Michael is nomed :3
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai again
<Michael> ohai MaxTheBrony!
<alexxm> how've you been MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/art/PONY-WIP-2-336732465?ga_submit=10%3A1352409197
<MaxTheBrony> needs opinions :P
<MaxTheBrony> Ive been great alexxm :)
<Vivix> Ohohoho yeahh baby
<Vivix> Keeps getting more and more awesome max
<Michael|sad> :(
<MaxTheBrony> Thanks to all the feed back :)
<Vivix> I have a love for that tail- it looks almost like a mix of feather and tail-hair
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<Michael|sad> MaxTheBrony: you made that?!
<MaxTheBrony> Michael|sad: Yepp :D
<MaxTheBrony> This was how it looked like first http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/#/d5jzhxr
<thelonepony> MaxTheBrony: Awesome :O
<MaxTheBrony> thelonepony: Thank you :)
<Michael|sad> MaxTheBrony: http://i.imgur.com/Vmnob.jpg
<MaxTheBrony> haha ;D Thank you Michael|sad :)
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix: Should i keep the rain?
<thelonepony> Michael|sad: :D
<Michael|sad> :)
<Vivix> I'd say yes, I like the rain- adds some bleakness whithout taking too much focus I think-
<Michael|sad> i doubt i will be on saturday to see the MLP stream :(
<Michael|sad> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 1 days, 17 hours, 41 minutes, 42 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<Kammerjunk> SOON
<CriticKitten> Aaaaaaand I'm about this close to quitting my job.
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix: Do you think i should redo it?
<Vivix> the rain?
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: You're about 1 day and 17 hours from quitting your job?
<Michael|sad> lol
<CriticKitten> Less.
<Kammerjunk> How come?
<CriticKitten> I'm debating quitting right now.
<VenHur> Aaand i'm back.
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix: yeh
<MaxTheBrony> Wb VenHur :)
<Michael|sad> ohai VenHur!
<Panda|Drawing> CriticKitten... its a job... job = money.. may people dont have them... you should be happy you have one.
<Vivix> MaxTheBrony, nah, it looks chaotic and good on the sizes on dA viewer- maybe- take away one of the splashes on the horizon of the rocks- but otherwise-
<CriticKitten> My school's assistant principals basically bullied me into accepting student work from the last six weeks because several kids complained when I insisted on enforcing a "no late homework" policy.
<Michael|sad> brb
<VenHur> ...So, who's here that knows games that are completely forgotten or had low sales and reviews, or never seen barely in Top 10s¡
<VenHur> *?
<CriticKitten> So yeah no, screw the "be happy you have a job" shit, being unemployed would be preferable right now.
<Panda|Drawing> CriticKitten, and thats bad how? if they have a problem, fail the fuckers.
<Michael|sad> back
<CriticKitten> Panda: You clearly didn't read that sentence correctly. Try again.
<Kammerjunk> VenHur: Can't think of any right now, but I don't read a lot of reviews.
<Kammerjunk> I tend to find I disagree with critics.
<thelonepony> Back :3
<CriticKitten> My policy is "no late homework". My assistant principals just FORCED me into accepting late work across the entire past six weeks due to student complaints.
<Michael|sad> Wb thelonepony
<VenHur> I think of know of one or two underrated games, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Age, and Seasons.
<CriticKitten> They very literally got together and met with me, and told me to do it.
<Invi> CriticKitten, you have to accept late homework? I guess alll our teachers would go nuts
<CriticKitten> Yep.
<ekips> VenHur Those are awesome, even though I never finished them, always got stuck
<Vivix> Our teacher would yell at the principla sometimes
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: That sounds fairly silly. Why put a deadline if you're allowed to deliver past it?
<VenHur> I think I know why they're clarified as underrated, Capcom was involved with making the Oracle games, and the Zelda fanboys must of bitchs about the move.
<Invi> indeed
<Kammerjunk> Dat Shizu.
<Yahooz> All aboard the shizumobile
<VenHur> My saying: WHY HATE?!
<CriticKitten> I'm being forced to accept late work for an entire six week period because my students are fucking lazy.
<CriticKitten> Not just assignments, either.
<CriticKitten> Quizzes too.
<CriticKitten> And tests.
<Panda|Drawing> CriticKitten, do you get actual money that goes in your pocket?
<CriticKitten> Starting to see why I'm a little pissed off?
<Kammerjunk> That sounds frustrating, but I still envy your job.
<Invi> CriticKitten, then let them write the fucking shit out of them
<CriticKitten> Kammer: Work my job for one week, you'll never envy my job again
<Kammerjunk> Not because it's a job, but because teaching sounds fun.
<VenHur> I like the Oracle games more than Ocarina of Time AND (oh dear god, don't kill me) Majora's Mask.
<CriticKitten> It's absolute hell.
<Panda|Drawing> I have been a TA before, for over a year... its stressful, but its still a job.
<Panda|Drawing> if you get paid
<Panda|Drawing> I dont see the issue.
<CriticKitten> I've only taken it until now because, as was previously said, "it's a job"
<Michael|sad> CriticKitten: what job do u have?
<XxNightHawk64xX> VenHur: ........woooooooooooowwwwwwwwww
<CriticKitten> But now it's going way beyond the point where I can tolerate it.
<killerpony7733> And shizu stream
<MaxTheBrony> Il do some detail work on the drawing tomorrow :p , I gotta get some sleep naow :) Good night everypony!
<Bronysith> yay, shizu stream
<XxNightHawk64xX> XxNightHawk64xX: jk man i respect everyones oppinion
<MadSurge> :O
<Vivix> Goodnight max
<MadSurge> SHIZUSTREAM
<thelonepony> oh look A Shizu stream
<Michael|sad> hey Shizuka
<Panda|Drawing> huh... must be a Sumica stream.
<AttackWithHugs|AFK> Shizustream, ahoy!
<killerpony7733> Panda|Drawing must be >_>
<RaveBrony> Shizuka time!
<VenHur> Link's Awakening is also underrated, but I seen some Top 10 with those games...sooo...it's in the between.
<CriticKitten> Panda: I'm making over 10% less than I did last year, despite all my bills going up in price.
<Kammerjunk> Panda|Drawing: I could also get paid for standing behind the counter in one of those neat little shops by the gas station (What are they called anyway?).
<XxNightHawk64xX> am i the only one who thinks they should put a marathon of every mlp: fim episode leading up to the crystal empire
<Panda|Drawing> CriticKitten, you earn money....
<Panda|Drawing> nuff said
<CriticKitten> Yes, less. Not more. Our school district has frozen all pay raises, and instead we're getting massive CUTS to our pay.
<Vivix> if your bills are going up, quitting is a horrible idea
<CriticKitten> Panda: I can earn money at McDonald's, too.
<killerpony7733> Dat quake 4
<Vivix> find another job FIRST, at the very least
<Michael|sad> oh, Q4
<shizumobile> Hallo ponies
<CriticKitten> And it'd be roughly as fulfilling.
<Kammerjunk> XxNightHawk64xX: A marathon of 10 episodes is planned already.
*Vordox le hugs shizumobile.
<Michael|sad> ohai shizumobile
<Kammerjunk> This is a good game.
<Kammerjunk> You people should get this game.
<Michael|sad> ^
<Yahooz> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 1 days, 17 hours, 33 minutes, 13 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<MadSurge> :O never played classic Quake ot this Quake
<MadSurge> *or
<CriticKitten> The whole logic of "it's a job therefore you should put up with all the shit" is spoken like someone who doesn't understand the situation at all. There are some jobs where the pay clearly isn't worth what's involved, this is one such position.
<MadSurge> Hello shizumobile :)
<Panda|Drawing> CriticKitten, then be smart about it. make sure you have the job at mc donalds before you quit this one... -__-
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk Well it's definitely good like doom 3 but atleast it lacks all those overdone jump scares from Doom 3
<Michael|sad> fuck this day :[
<Kammerjunk> Shame I can only play it when I go to a netcafé. I do have Quake 1 and 2, but I think Quake 4 is more fun (at least the multiplayer).
<CriticKitten> Hell, taking unemployment would be more fulfilling. >_>
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Those used to scare me when I played DOOM 3 as a child.
<Panda|Drawing> ...
<VenHur> Bad news folks, I'd never owned any of the Quake games, you can sue me for that, but I never had aknowledge of the series.
<Kammerjunk> VenHur: I pity the foo'.
<shizumobile> Also content warning, this is definitely more gory that doom 3
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk The atmosphere tbh was good not doubt but i just think it put too much focus on jump scaring you too much
<Panda|Drawing> You compain about not earning enough to pay bills... but if you have no job and 0 money... how are you going to attempt to pay those bills...
<killerpony7733> no*
<CriticKitten> Yeah, you heard me. Judge me all you like. You have no idea what I've put up with at this job.
<Panda|Drawing> that logic makes no sense.
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Probably. I can't really remember it very well.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk But overall it was a good game.
<Vivix> It is silly, but it's your life and none of my business
<shizumobile> Um sir, you appear to be missing your everything
<killerpony7733> Especially ROE the expansion
<Kammerjunk> I think I have it somewhere, actually.
<Vordox> O.o
<Kammerjunk> 'Tis just a flesh wound.
<Vivix> Doom3 was fun, but I hated the ending
<killerpony7733> I have both ROE and doom 3
<MadSurge> VenHur: first game was about eldritch abominations invading the earth, second game was a race of cyborg aliens called the Strogg, 3 was a multiplayer game and in 4 it's the Strogg again
<killerpony7733> Vivix What for if i may ask? i'm curious
<CriticKitten> Panda: It's called unemployment checks. They'd be enough to cover the bills while I look for another job, preferably one that doesn't require throwing out every one of my principles. <_<
<Buytoast> ah, Doom 7
<Kammerjunk> I've only played Quake 4 multiplayer, to be honest.
<Vivix> killerpony7733, I remember getting reaaally excited about teleportatoin, story- strange stuff, and then it just ended with a bossbattle just when things were getting interesting
<Vivix> I haven't played it since though- the game itself was fun
<shizumobile> Singleplayer is pretty good for this, does get repetitive at the end though
<CriticKitten> Panda: It's literally impossible for me to hold students to any standard if I can't even dictate how my own classroom functions without the kids complaining to get it changed. And if I can look forward to making less money every year, I'll have to quit eventually anyways.
<Dark_Horst> what am i looking at?
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Pixels.
<killerpony7733> Vivix Oh yeah i did like the cyberdemon but yeah the end was really just keep killing 4 enemies to fill your special item and hit it and just repeat no special stuff to do and all
<Kammerjunk> Probably. I'm not sure.
<shizumobile> Also you all know I'll be godmoding eventually right
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<killerpony7733> Vivix Not much sense of reward but ROE made that better though
<Panda|Drawing> CriticKitten, if you say no. I would rather squeeze all I could out of a job before I left it. but its your choice ^^
<shizumobile> How's quality
<Vivix> RoE yeah- I shuld pick up RoE as it has thee eend sort of?
<alexxm> welp everyones ded
<killerpony7733> Good good
<Kammerjunk> It's good.
<Vordox> shizumobile: Pretty good
<Michael|sad> kinga good
<Michael|sad> *kinda
<CriticKitten> Panda: I've definitely made up my mind. I'm quitting at the end of this school year. That gives me plenty of time to find another school to work at.
<Vordox> shizumobile: Great FPS, and the graphics are mixed on the textures, but DAMN sweet.
<VenHur> American FUCKING McGee made Quake AND Doom II?! :O (yeah, just found out moments ago...)
<Michael|sad> i used to love this game
<CriticKitten> Panda: I'm not just saying "I'ma quit right now and fuck everything", I'm a bit smarter than that.
<shizumobile> Yeah textures are pretty meh
<Vivix> CriticKitten, now that sounds like a much better plan than quitting now- I hope you find something nice
<alexxm> VenHur did you know the guys name is actually american mcgee
<Vivix> you did sound like "NOW!" though, hence our bafflement
<Buytoast> please respond
<Kammerjunk> no
<CriticKitten> I'm quitting "now" in the sense that I don't see a reason to keep investing all of my energy and time like I was doing.
<Vivix> Ah okay-
<Vivix> sucks for the students
<Kammerjunk> They don't mind.
<Vivix> but--they're the ones who messed it up
<CriticKitten> They don't care anyways.
<Vivix> seems like it
<Vivix> My favourite math teacher was harassed by a girl in our class
<CriticKitten> They'd be perfectly happy if I just made up grades (which, mind, I won't do).
<Vivix> she was horrible to him, and he was this nervous guy who looked like he'd cry every time she yelled at him
<Kammerjunk> I still don't get that. How can they be annoyed you don't accept assignments turned in AFTER the deadline? What grade do you teach?
<Sick_icybeauti> Oh the shcool system. How vast yet terrible you are...
<CriticKitten> I'm just not gonna pour several hours of after-school time into things like I used to.
<Vivix> yeah, I get you on that
<shizumobile> Lots of Steve blum btw
<Vivix> give them a "You're fucking late" grade
<CriticKitten> Kammer: High schoolers.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> why not just deduct a percent of the greade for late homwork
<CriticKitten> grades 10-12.
<Sick_icybeauti> I remeber my science teacher last year would give you detention if you needed to use the bathroom. THE MUTHBUCKING BATHROOM! And she'd give referals if you were even a second late to class.
<CriticKitten> Not allowed to, twilight. I've been forced by these assistant principals to accept EVERY late assignment.
<Michael|sad> omg
<Buytoast> thena ccept them and deduct two letter grades
<CriticKitten> And give full credit if they turn it in.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: I'd say they should know better, but being in that range of years, I know they don't.
<Buytoast> wait
<thelonepony> Sprunkls!!!!!
<Buytoast> what
*thelonepony hugs sprunkls :3
<Vivix> That's the students yeah, but why would the principle assistants agree?
<Buytoast> might as well tell them to hand in the assignment whenever they feel like it
<Vordox> shizumobile: How OLD is this game, the graphics are subpar(For today) But the gameplay seems pretty good, the controls especially.
<CriticKitten> Because my students are not only fucking lazy as hell, they then complained to the principal and made up lies about how I'm being mean and oppressing them.
<shizumobile> 05 I think?
<Sick_icybeauti> Some teachers shouldn't even be teaching though....
<Vivix> He won't let me teext on my iiiphooone he's totally breaching my freedom of speeech
<twoiloight_spurnkle> well, that seems counter-productive. id allow occasionalfew days late hw if i see someone is hard-working but coudlnt do it for a reason, but accepting all late homework isnt a good idea yeah
<shizumobile> It doom 3 engine
<CriticKitten> One such lie was that I "laughed at them as they were taking their tests" which is a blatant lie.
<Vordox> <<----- Good quality game 'ere guys :P
<Michael|sad> ^
<Vordox> shizumobile: Doom 3 WITHOUT expensive graphics? :P
<VenHur> It's from 2005, revolutionary at its time.
<CriticKitten> The kids in this school just disgust me. There's no desire for honesty.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Parents.
<CriticKitten> It's so sad. What happened to having values and self-respect?
