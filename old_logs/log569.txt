<sub06905> ello Texasboykc09
<SirGanjalf> hello Texasboykc09
<MegaMoonShine> Hello SirGanjalf n Texasboykc09 :)
<Saturn> 08,01okay everyone, listen up! it's wrek and luna's birthday tomorrow (Thursday)! yes, both of them! we're planning something real special, including films and SPECIAL MESSAGES FROM YOU EVERYONE. This means YOU LOT AS WELL! Record/write your messages, and send them as video/audio/text to saturn@bronystate.net. Any text ones, I'll read out, and we'll broadcast them all tomorrow. SEND ME THEM ASAP, AS I'M COMPILING THE VIDEO TONIGHT!
*Saturn 08,01hopes that message was not truncated
<MadSurge> Dat wall of text
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: ends with "TONIGHT!"
<Saturn> 08,01good!
<Ryunosuke> thats a bit of short notice ;)
<sub06905> :o
<Saturn> 08,01aye, i only found out yesterday, and i've been trying to arrange something since then
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Saturn> 08,01we've got some cool stuff planned
<PonyNegZero> and I'm guessing "Don't spoil this or I'll gut you", like always?
<Saturn> 08,01yes! if anyone breathes a word about this to either of them, i will go on a killing spree
<Saturn> 08,01starting with you and your family
<sub06905> :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wont Wr3k know about this message?
<Saturn> 08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: nope, i just kicked him ^.^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> O_O
<sub06905> lol
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<Gabbygums> Why are we watching this?
<Wrek> 05well that was uneccesary
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> theres probably going to be a lot of explaining after this xD
<Gabbygums> Grimrock...
<Saturn> 08,01hi wrek! <3
<String_Shredder> Wrek: but it was funny
<MadSurge> Friendly kick <3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Mod Fight? xD
<SirGanjalf> ^
<PonyNegZero> we were seeing if you were actually paying attention to the stream...
<PonyNegZero> we felt a tad bit lonely
<MadSurge> ^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^^
<sub06905> ^^^
<PonyNegZero> and he goes back to his game... and ignoring us...
<MadSurge> :D
<SirGanjalf> I don't blame him
<Saturn> 08,01dat flakey internet gabbygums
<SirGanjalf> It looks pretty cool
<PonyNegZero> but he is providing entertainment for us, so I guess that works
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SirGanjalf: Loot makes this addicting
<SirGanjalf> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Ah yes, me like loot:P
<SirGanjalf> Kinda regret now that i haven't bought it yet. Oh, well, maybe there will be another discount
<PonyNegZero> I was hoping the community choice was going to be oblivion for $5, but that didn't happen :(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> 1 percent off
<SirGanjalf> ^ D:
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol friendly fire
<SirGanjalf> hehe, stupid armors
<PonyNegZero> if you aren't getting exp for those, you might want to actually try killing them instead...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> PonyNegZero: he'll get overwhelmed
<PonyNegZero> he should be able to handle 2
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> naw
<PonyNegZero> he should have been able to kill the last one himself, easily
<SirGanjalf> ...
<Sylandest> the game's flipping out
<MegaMoonShine> Dude...
<SirGanjalf> Collective dream? Dungeoception!(had to be done)
<Sylandest> :D
<PonyNegZero> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: imagine if dropping them down just makes them appear later in the game - that would be really funny
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<SirGanjalf> yeah, "funny"
<MadSurge> Hi Lil_B!
<SirGanjalf> hi Lil_B
<SirGanjalf> :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi Lil_B
<sub06905> ello Lil_B
<Lil_B> hi MadSurge SirGanjalf Darkts3|Drawing|MLG and sub06905 :)
<Texasboykc09> hello Lil_B
<Twi_Fi> Hello Lil_B.
<PonyNegZero> SirGanjalf: I would find it pretty funny
<MadSurge> ^
<SirGanjalf> SNAILS:O
<Lil_B> and Twi_Fi and Texasboykc09 :)
<Sylandest> howdy, Lil_B!
<Lil_B> hi Sylandest
<MegaMoonShine> Sup Lil_B /)
<PonyNegZero> I think I was right...
<MadSurge> How are things Lil_B?
<Lil_B> (\ MegaMoonShine
<Lil_B> MadSurge frustraiting :/
<MadSurge> Lil_B: how so?
<Lil_B> I got my MIDI to USB Cable, but it won't register my Keyboard
<PonyNegZero> Lil_B: are you sure the driver for the keyboard is booting properly?
<Lil_B> (I do this for the first time and have no Idea how its supposed to work, there iare no instructions and I found no answers online)
<Saturn> 08,01i just received an e-mail from the Principle of the University of St Andrews (where I currently work and study) saying that our Head of Computer Science has been promoted to Dean of Sciences
<Saturn> 08,01and it included a picture of him, thus: http://imgur.com/4ERj9
<Lil_B> PonyNegZero its an older keyboard (around 8 years) I didn't saw any driver installations though...
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01i am seriously considering e-mailing back saying "My god, man, WHERE ARE HIS EYES?"
<String_Shredder> yeah scince!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: LOL dat face
<String_Shredder> *Science
<Saturn> 08,01and sent.
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: not sure if extreme happiness or photoshop...
<SirGanjalf> Saturn: Maybe he's related to Brock? :D
<Lil_B> Saturn his Eyes are like Rockos from Pokemon
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> he probably blinked during the photo xD
<String_Shredder> Looks like Brock got older
<somepony_else> It's Brock's father
<MadSurge> Saturn: He suffers from Youngblood Syndrome! :D
<pony_7007> who's streaming?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek is pony_7007
<Lil_B> oh... "Rocko=Brock in the german version appearently...)
<Lil_B> well, looks like I have to get a new mini keyboard afterll...
<Texasboykc09> What's Wrek playing?
<Lil_B> its better anyway because I don't have much space and I can play it directly infront of the screen XD
<MegaMoonShine> Texasboykc09: Legends of Grimrock
<PonyNegZero> Lil_B: If I had to take a guess, it would be that your computer doesn't have an appropriate driver, so it is ignoring it
<Lil_B> PonyNegZero thats probably it, but I really have no Idea how I should fix this
<Saturn> 08,01also, because i forgot to say before, the festivities will be commencing at 9pm UTC tomorrow (Thursday). Adjust for your own timezone.
<Saturn> 08,01
<Saturn> 08,01also, keep e-mailing me those birthday messages for luna and wrek! saturn@bronystate.net
<Saturn> 08,01pm me if you don't know what i'm talking about
<Lil_B> I mailed my like 2 month ago... wait for wre k too?
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: this is something different
<Saturn> 08,01it's wrek and luna's birthday tomorrow
<Lil_B> Saturn ok
<PonyNegZero> Lil_B: Lil_sorry, I don't know anything about what you have, so I can't be too helpful... but good luck, I guess.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> and Wrek is gone again XD
<Saturn> 08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: i kicked him again
<Lil_B> PonyNegZero thanks anyways :)
<MadSurge> Saturn: you ass :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i know Saturn
<PonyNegZero> Saturn is best abusive mod.
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<Lil_B> Saturn I would E-Mail something, but I don't have your E-Mail :)
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: saturn@bronystate.net
<CountDoofus> Haio, Saturn
<Lil_B> ok, afk working on an E-Mail :)
<Pinkies4thWall> Saturn: this is why nopony bucks with you
<Every_Pony> you killed my babies
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> already got messages made for Wrek, and Luna Individually
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :)
*Saturn 08,01nuzzles Unnr
<Unnr> Hai Saturn!~
*Unnr hates running errands
<PonyNegZero> double kill
<Vordox> Hai Saturn
<Wrek> 05gotta love runnign out of antivenom
<Lil_B> oh, finally I got a Bronystate Newsletter again after 4 weeks XD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> and Wrek is back
<PonyNegZero> Wrek: gotta love not paying attention to IRC until you die~
<PonyNegZero> Wrek: but we still love you anyhow
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> he cant hear you lol
<Wrek> 05well i love this game so far
<Wrek> 05gettin' emerged :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> cool
<PonyNegZero> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: ha, he might have read it
<OtakuTom> Don't you mean immersed, Wrek? :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ol
<Wrek> 05whatever
<OtakuTom> lol
<Lil_B> just looked up The seven Samurai on IMDb too see when it was made... they are making a remake in 2014 T.T the horror
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lil_B: ppl are running out of ideas, its sad
<Vordox> Wrek be dying lots
<Pinkies4thWall> Lil_B: Remake EVERYTHING
<Unnr> Lil_B: Wait what? Noooo.
<PonyNegZero> Vordox: he's probably glad that this isn't a true roguelike - no saves...
<Lil_B> Well, lets just hope a Citizen Kande remake is in the works... because why not...
<Lil_B> Kane*
<MadSurge> Lil_B: D: NOOO
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol spider bugged
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2675#comic
<Unnr> whats being streamed?
<Lil_B> I accedently my Desktop... all the letters on my Files are now Transparent...
<OtakuTom> We'll call the Citizen Kane remake Rosebud and make it from the point of view of (censored for those who don't know who/what/where Rosebud is). It'll be the best remake ever!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: that was interesting O_O
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: well played
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah, interesting O___0
<Saturn> 08,01i know mathematicians who are exactly like that
<Saturn> 08,01and physicists...
<Pinkies4thWall> bucking hate random dc's
<MadSurge> Saturn: lol math humor, it goes all over my head :P
<Unnr> Saturn, to be fair physicists tend to abuse variables
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: trye
<Saturn> 08,01*true
<Pinkies4thWall> Saturn: waitwut
*Unnr points an accusning hoof at the re-use of letters in E&M
<Saturn> 08,01OH GOD
<Saturn> 08,01YES
<Pinkies4thWall> all i see is an empty channel
<Saturn> 08,01and omegas...
<Saturn> 08,01omegas everywhere...
<Saturn> 08,01i call the small ones wobble-yus.
<OtakuTom> I love math and science humor. I tend to get most of it.
<Unnr> When it was said I am the Alpha and the Omega, they really meant the end of the world was gonna happen when a physicist ran out of ways to use the omega.
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG is gunna take a shower
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: have a Ω
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: I don't remember what the alt code for a wobble-yu is... I never had to type those
<OtakuTom> Anyway, I should probably try to sleep for a little bit if I'm gonna try to get one of those portal guns...here's hoping it comes up as close to 11:00 (2 hours from now) as possible...lol
<String_Shredder> Rubberfruit's back on youtube!
<Unnr> Tries to give PonyNegZero change for the omega, all I got its a ϕ and a ψ
<PonyNegZero> Unnr: Ω is 234
<Pinkies4thWall> Mfw annoying orange has a fucking tv show: :|
<Saturn> 08,01ω <-- wobble-yu
<Saturn> 08,01that's a small omega
<Unnr> PonyNegZero: don´t use windows altcodes >.>
<Saturn> 08,01Ω is a capital omega
<Unnr> ælll righty then!
<String_Shredder> Pinkies4thWall: Tobuscus is on it. Everything has been solved
<PonyNegZero> Unnr: I had to use it for physics...
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: I know what it is, I just don't know the alt code since I never needed to know it
<Saturn> 08,01we used Ω for lower complexity bounds in computer science
<Pinkies4thWall> String_Shredder: Tobuscus being on it made me unsubscribe to him
<Pinkies4thWall> I lost a LOT of respect
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: interesting
<Saturn> 08,01O is upper complexity bound
<Texasboykc09> what a alt code
<Saturn> 08,01when Ω and O are equal, it's said to be a tight complexity bound, or ϕ
<Unnr> Saturn: is O(n^2) complex
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: it's an upper bound of polynomial time
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: well, I'm working on a NullReferenceException right now... somewhat suitable for the conversation...
<Saturn> 08,01but it gets complicated, depending on how fast your function grows...
<Quick_Thinker> Saturn what the hay are you talking about i just got back from eating breakfast
<Unnr> I meant to state you were O(n^2) complex, not make it a question, darn tab autocomplete colon Saturn!
<Pinkies4thWall> mfw I want so badly to understand what Saturn is talking about but i can't: :(
<Saturn> 08,01O(n^x) can be a better complexity than O(x^n), when n in the former is low, and n in the latter is high
<PonyNegZero> Unnr: punctuation is important - "Go eat, grandma" and "Go eat grandma" are very different
<Saturn> 08,01there will be a crossover point, but before that, you're better using the former (exponential) algorithm
<Unnr> PonyNegZero: *nods*
<Pinkies4thWall> PonyNegZero: i lol'd when i agreed
<Quick_Thinker> so confused by Saturn talking but i have a feeling it has to do with either physics or quantim stuff
<Unnr> Saturn: my fav concept from Computer Science will always be the bogo sort
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: ha! yes, i love that
<Wrek> 05feck
<PonyNegZero> bogosort is best sort!
<Unnr> Its the troll sort
<Saturn> 08,01one of my favourites is Spaghetti Sort
<Quick_Thinker> Saturn WHAT THE HAY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
<Unnr> Quick_Thinker: the bogo sort is a way of sorting elements that roughly says
<Unnr> take elements, shuffle around at random, check to see if they are in the order you want
<Saturn> 08,01because you can only use it on physical objects, or simulations of such
<Unnr> if not, repeat
<Saturn> 08,01liek psaghetti
<Quick_Thinker> okay so sorting the elments form the periodic table or sometihng like that
<Saturn> 08,01*spaghetti
*PonyNegZero nibbles on Saturn.
<Pinkies4thWall> Saturn: SA-getty
<Unnr> the classic example of bogosorting is take a deck of cards and shuffle. if not completely in order, reshuffle.
<Pinkies4thWall> ddid i pronounce that right?
<MadSurge> Mmm, spaghetti :D
<Quick_Thinker> i take it i will bogosorting in senior or junior year?
<PonyNegZero> Saturn doesn't taste like spaghetti...
<Lil_B> Saturn did you listen to the song I send you 3 or 4 day ago?
<Quick_Thinker> im a sophmore now
<Pinkies4thWall> last night, i walked in to where m roommate was sitting, said, "I'm eating yogurt", and he giggled for 15 minutes
<Lil_B> speaking about music... what should I listen too now... Donkey Kong or Dragonforce :/
<Unnr> Whenever life makes me sad, I just remember that ISO 3103 exists
<Quick_Thinker> ^ waht?
<Unnr> Quick_Thinker: Are you familliar with the idea of an ISO standard?
<Quick_Thinker> no
<RobertRevenge> I would have never thought you could have drama on Minecraft. MINECRAFT.
<Quick_Thinker> im a high school student
<PonyNegZero> RobertRevenge: wrong
<RobertRevenge> PonyNegZero: Half of the staff of the server I'm on quit because of stupid arguments last night. Meaning they're going to fill the positions with globbing idiots due to lack of time to weed out the bad seeds. :/
<PonyNegZero> RobertRevenge: sounds about right...
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: oh yeah, i was meaning to get back to you about that; i enjoyed it, and have some constructive criticism for you
<Unnr> ISO is the International Organazation for Standardization, they spend their time defining basic measures of most everything.
<Saturn> 08,01bug me abotu it later
<Lil_B> Saturn whenever you have time :)
<Unnr> ISO 3103 is " Tea -- Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests"
<Saturn> 08,01Quick_Thinker: wikipedia is your friend
<Unnr> Abstract : The method consists in extracting of soluble substances in dried tea leaf, containing in a porcelain or earthenware pot, by means of freshly boiling water, pouring of the liquor into a white porcelain or earthenware bowl, examination of the organoleptic properties of the infused leaf, and of the liquor with or without milk or both.
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: that is amazing
*Saturn 08,01loves tea
<Unnr> Saturn: IKR?
<Pinkies4thWall> guys, do any of you enjoy saying typos phonetically?
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, i think it's time for a pot
<RobertRevenge> Pinkies4thWall: Indeed I do.
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: do I need to go to the office keurig machine and get something to drink?
<MadSurge> Pinkies4thWall: I do! :D
<Pinkies4thWall> :)
<Lil_B> "...and of the liquor with or without milk or both." I would like my teas both with and without Milk please
<RobertRevenge> Pinkies4thWall: One of my favorites is Hlep. It makes me giggle. :)
<Pinkies4thWall> Saturn: which sort?
<Wrek> 05OH WELL
<Pinkies4thWall> RobertRevenge: I giggled too
<Wrek> 05damend spiders and their poison attack
<Malavolent> That death sound.
<PonyNegZero> needs more wilhelm scream...
<MadSurge> ^
<Saturn> 08,01Pinkies4thWall: spaghetti sort
<Saturn> 08,01it uses physical principles to sort
<Saturn> 08,01so you can only sort physical objects
<Saturn> 08,01or simulations of suh
<Pinkies4thWall> For those who like sounding out typos phonetically, do you like typing them out syllable for syllable, as you would in a dictionary?
<Pinkies4thWall> What's the most typos anyone's ever seen in one word?
<Pinkies4thWall> :( dead chat
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> did i miss anything important?
<Twi_Fi> <_<
<Twi_Fi> >_>
<Pinkies4thWall> ^_^
<MadSurge> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: not really
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> kay
<Pinkies4thWall> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: pudding
<Unnr> Pinkies4thWall: þudding?
<Pinkies4thWall> Unnr: is that an alt code at the beginning of that word?
<Pinkies4thWall> can't tell
<Unnr> nope, that's a þ as in, every rose has its þ
*Pinkies4thWall is hopelessly confuzzled
<Unnr> the Þ or þ (read: thorn) is a letter used in several old languages and modern icelanding
<Unnr> icelandic
*Pinkies4thWall will now eat yogurt
<Unnr> it sounds like th in the wold thick
*Pinkies4thWall wishes he knew a European language. Maybe German or Swedish, possibly French
*Pinkies4thWall has smuckers. u jelly/
<Pinkies4thWall> *?
<Pinkies4thWall> I'm not sure if that's a pun
<RobertRevenge> That's a pun.
<String_Shredder> Pinkies4thWall: no. I'm jam
<Pinkies4thWall> :D
<RobertRevenge> I need to find a good place to meet some female bronies. Too bad there isn't anywhere around here like that.
<PonyNegZero> RobertRevenge: remember, there are no girls on the internet [jk, there are a few]
<Pinkies4thWall> RobertRevenge: I like making people happy, but as I am male, I fail you. :(
<RobertRevenge> PonyNegZero: I consider 90% of people on the internet male until proven otherwise.
<Pinkies4thWall> RobertRevenge: does your geographical territory have a brony facebook page?
<Pinkies4thWall> Like, mine is utah bronies
<RobertRevenge> Pinkies4thWall: Not that I know of.
<PonyNegZero> RobertRevenge: my tf2 clan has a 2 females - one is a regular, one is an alt
<RobertRevenge> C'mon Wrek, you got this!
<Pinkies4thWall> I just don't get girls
<shuddup> wat?
<RobertRevenge> Pinkies4thWall: I totally get girls, but that's mainly because I'm a really effiminate guy.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol
<PonyNegZero> disregard females, aquire mares?
<shuddup> TREE
<Pinkies4thWall> PonyNegZero: Disregard females, acquire Vidya gaems
<RobertRevenge> PonyNegZero: Oh glob, I don't think I want mares
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> Problem is, you can't pass your seed on with video games alone.
<RobertRevenge> PonyNegZero: They aren't technicolored in real life
*Pinkies4thWall rode a 19 year old mare yesterday. her name is QT. http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m77ys7DmgX1rv2re5o1_1280.jpg
<RobertRevenge> D'aww
<PonyNegZero> RobertRevenge: they can be with a little spraypaint...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Pinkies4thWall: cool
*Pinkies4thWall just realized how out of context that can go
<RobertRevenge> PonyNegZero: But..but.. No magic. No parties. They're just horses. D;
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> BTW, mom took up her computer so I'm back on my sometimes-dead, sometimes-working old computer. I'm using my other nick because she might get onto the internet from somewhere else, such as a hospital or her workplace.
<PonyNegZero> RobertRevenge: for fun, I know a family who owns horses and they dyed one of them... I think dark blue... (she was going to get shaved for the summer, so they just thought it would be fun)
*Pinkies4thWall wants to obtain horse, make natural coat color pink, and party like a baus
<MadSurge> ^ :D
<shuddup> so....whats this vid about???
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> PonyNegZero, let me guess: the dye got onto her skin?
<RobertRevenge> Geneticists, we demand technicolor ponies!
<Pinkies4thWall> shuddup: Wrek is playing some sort of game
<prince-dari> RobertRevenge: Fuck that.
<prince-dari> I want a T Rex.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> Well, that calls for a horse of a different color!
<prince-dari> Now.
<Pinkies4thWall> ohai prince-dari
<PonyNegZero> Kandarihu|Buddybear: I don't believe so
<RobertRevenge> prince-dari: Personally, I would prefer a chocobo
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i wanna ride a sabertooth lion
<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, prince-dari
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi prince-dari
<prince-dari> Hey
<RobertRevenge> I demand a giant yellow chicken to ride around on like a baws :<
<Pinkies4thWall> dari, i've always wondered. Why blue text?
<Unnr> prince-dari: the trike or the dinosaur?
<Pinkies4thWall> just because, or what?
<prince-dari> The dinosaur of course
<prince-dari> And as for text colour
<prince-dari> It was probably just a random choice
<prince-dari> I don't really remember
<prince-dari> I used to use different colours though
<Pinkies4thWall> oh.
<Pinkies4thWall> i liek random

<Unnr> anypony catch the name of this game?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> its called Legends of Grimrock Unnr
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> Is the stream down, or do I have to allow RequestPolicy to tolerate a cross-domain request for cpxinteractive.com?

<shuddup> ITS A TRAP
<RobertRevenge> Wrek: Throw a rock on it.
<shuddup> ITS A TRAP
<Pinkies4thWall> RobertRevenge: if it were me, i'd join the largest one if it's the largest by a big margin
<RobertRevenge> Pinkies4thWall: I did, about 350 in the largest. The rest are about 40-50 per group.
<Pinkies4thWall> RobertRevenge: yeah, Utah bronies has over 500 members
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi Bronysith
<RobertRevenge> Ohai Bronysith
<Bronysith> whom is streaming and what?
<Texasboykc09> hello Bronysith
<RobertRevenge> Wrek is streaming a roguelike.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek is streaming Legends of Grimrock
<Bronysith> ahh
<PonyNegZero> RobertRevenge: a roguelike with save points...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^

<Very_Silly_Filly> Couldn't you tell by the dialect?
<rockytoppie85> Pinkies4thWall|xbox: what?
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> Saturn, that information's outdated now.
<GilDash> Saturn: Cue RD "OMGs" and Twi "YESs" from Bronies everywhere around the world.
<Pinkies4thWall|xbox> rockytoppie85: where do you live?
<Very_Silly_Filly> GilDash: All I did was Fluttershy "Yaey"
<rockytoppie85> Pinkies4thWall|xbox: America, the rest is classified :P

<Ryunosuke> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2230398/
<rockytoppie85> THERE EVERYWHERE D:
<Saturn> 08,01Very_Silly_Filly: cheapest i found was £60 inc p&p
<rockytoppie85> xD
<sub06905> ded
<Very_Silly_Filly> Exactly :c
<rockytoppie85> ded
<Saturn> 08,01i'm very tempted to actually pay that...
<bob> why do i keep hearing loud beeping noises o_o
<Everlasting_Joy> The way I see S3's air date, it wlll be what it will be.
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> Well, lightIRC responds to CTCP requests as any IRC client honestly has to. So I know that Rocky is in ET. But that doesn't narrow things down much.
<Saturn> 08,01i hope the premiere is mid-august...
<OtakuTom> YES!!!! I GOT IT!!!
<RainBowJack> Everlasting_Joy : when will it be on?
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm hoping it's mid-September to be honest.
<Everlasting_Joy> RainBowJack: I don't know.
<rockytoppie85> Kandarihu|Buddybear: Stop trying to find out were i live with your fancy mathmatics :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> Mid august
<RainBowJack> i tought i would be september
<Saturn> 08,01woah, derpies are selling for $200 on ebay...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wrek: They're still ded
<bob> jesus
<rockytoppie85> derpie dolls?
<ekips> hm, could 5cm per second be considered as A or B movie?
<rockytoppie85> i mean... not dolkls im sry D:
<Saturn> 08,01rockytoppie85: no, official derpy toys
<Everlasting_Joy> RainBowJack: There's a new video/article saying it could be next August, but I honestly don't know nor care. It will air when it airs, and that's all I care about.
<Very_Silly_Filly> An A film is a high budget high rating film
<Saturn> 08,01the comiccon ones
<rockytoppie85> the toy thingys with the hair?
<Very_Silly_Filly> A B film are the lower budget still kinda popular ones
<Saturn> 08,01derpy madness
<Saturn> 08,01rockytoppie85: aye
<rockytoppie85> oh
<RainBowJack> well Everlasting_Joy i dont care either but i am so excited to get a season 3
<rockytoppie85> Saturn: yes?
<Very_Silly_Filly> My Neice has bloody Rarity
<Very_Silly_Filly> I might steal it :3
<ekips> I don't know the budget of 5cm per second...it's got a 7.9 rating on imdb though
<Majestic_Sparkler> Ohhh! This game
<Majestic_Sparkler> i luv this game :D
<alexxm> so how far into the game is this
<Everlasting_Joy> RainBowJack: The better question is, who isn't?
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> rockytoppie85, sorry.
<Majestic_Sparkler> its like in the start
<rockytoppie85> Kandarihu|Buddybear: Its okay :D
<RainBowJack> i think everypony is ^^
<alexxm> thanks Majestic_Sparkler
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Comic-Con-2012-Exclusive-Derpy-Hooves-in-box-/170880662106?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item27c947fa5a#ht_1258wt_1398
<OtakuTom> Holy crap...I think I refreshed the page at just the right time...I just bought one of the replica P-body portal guns and when I went back to the product page, it says it's not available again.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Fucking hell, 180 pounds byout
<OtakuTom> Maybe not...the buy now button's back.
<Saturn> 08,01rockytoppie85: yes
<alexxm> i assume the floating blue rock can't be good
<rockytoppie85> want something?
<Very_Silly_Filly> alexxm: It's a restoration rock
<Majestic_Sparkler> The blue rock is like a save point
<Very_Silly_Filly> Heals your parpty
<Majestic_Sparkler> yes.
<alexxm> thanks Very_Silly_Filly
<Saturn> 08,01rockytoppie85: nope!
<PonyNegZero> What, a roguelike with a "restoration rock" pshhh
<rockytoppie85> ould get that derpy.... but for 200? who decided that!?
<Very_Silly_Filly> PonyNegZero: Don't underestimate this game
<rockytoppie85> yet the highest bid is like 20
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's still retarded
<Everlasting_Joy> rockytoppie85: That's the art of flipping.
<bob> greedy people
<PonyNegZero> Very_Silly_Filly: if there is a game harder than nethack, I'd be surprised...
<Saturn> 08,01PonyNegZero: IWTBTG
<Saturn> 08,01nethack is actually playable
<OtakuTom> Wow...I think it really did go out of stock in like 5 minutes...I really did refresh the page at just the right time...lol
<rockytoppie85> And i would NEVER get it from ebay. one time i got a harry potter poster..... and i waited till october.... OF 2010 ITS STILL NOT HERE! ergh i hate ebay noa.
<rockytoppie85> scammers
<Saturn> 08,01rockytoppie85: did you get your money back?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Olol, there's atually a muffin on the box
<rockytoppie85> Saturn: Nu :[
<Very_Silly_Filly> rockytoppie85: Then tell them to give the money back
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<rockytoppie85> Very_Silly_Filly: Its been 2 years...
<Everlasting_Joy> And?
<OtakuTom> I've never had a problem with buying stuff from ebay. You just have to look at the seller feedback.
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: IWTBTG is easier in my mind... (I haven't played it for all it is worth, but at least all of the deaths are entirely your own fault)
<Very_Silly_Filly> If they don't. then there's nothing youcan do about it
<Saturn> 08,01the thing i like about ebay is that if you *do* get scammed, it's relatively easy to reclaim your money
<Saturn> 08,01ach well
<sub06905> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4684/
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oop
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oppse
<rockytoppie85> Oopsie.
<OtakuTom> Yea, if you don't get your item, you make a claim with ebay and they follow up on it. It's a personal rule of mine to never leave feedback on any item I purchase until I actually get it.
<rockytoppie85> if only i could go to commic con.
<bob> that rainbow dash face looks wierd

<FairysHuff> DJNilla Moist Sparkle.
<Dken2021> rockytoppie85 episodes are usually played on a livestream stream
<FairysHuff> Ponies47 Holla

<MadSurge> Eulshy: probably a draw, because of love and tolerance being a common theme :D
<Lil_B> hi DJNilla ;)
<EggWhite> Eulshy: There are some I believe
*PonyNegZero nuzzles DJNilla.
<crazypony> hi Ponies47
<MegaMoonShine> Later everypony :)
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> I can just imagine what would happen if a parent were to force his/her child to diligently practice at the electric guitar from a young age like some parents force their children to practice at the violin. The kid is basically destined from then on to become a speed-guitarist.
<Michael> bye MegaMoonShine
<Ponies47> Bye MegaMoonShine
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NO DJNilla! DON'T LOOK AT THE STREAM!

<MadSurge> Dragonforce are kind of a one-trick pony, but they make awesome music :D
<Kandarihu|Buddybear> PonyNegZero, I'm talking about guitar playing that takes an entire childhood to master. And I honestly doubt that these living legends of the guitar practiced several hours every day from the age of four.

<MadSurge> Wrek: Ikr
<N4X> I didn't know you could play piano strings with a bow too...but it figures

<Kandarihu|Buddybear> I'm getting worried about S3. It's not going to be running in August. And apparently, there's no confirmation that it's even going to be September. They told EQD that they "hope" to have it out by the end of 2012. To me, that implies that not even that's set in stone.

<Kandarihu> Ignoring him is also a good option.
<ponibas> Nitt I gotta tell you somthing

*Dark92Enigma leaves the hoof massage for a while, starts dancing
<Vordox> Heh aye Sumica

<Rodney> JESmith: somebody needs to point out to him that there is p--n of everything, even himself
<Kandarihu> JESmith, I don't think anyone takes him seriously.

<Vinco> It's not like you could make a tripod out of some sticks, or something.

<pony_245024> Okay fellow ponies... :,( i had a horrible day and i need some pinkie pie smiles. Anypony got anything to link to that will make me smile?
<CK|Catnap> Sumica: A tripod mount would be more steady than this. >_>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What's Bourne trying to do?
<CK|Catnap> THIS ISN'T SOME KIND OF MOVIE.
<CK|Catnap> THIS IS REAL.
<CK|Catnap> :|
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: The reporter knows someone connected to his past. Or something.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Assset.
<Sumica> 00,10a 1980 camcorder would be more steady then this
<Kandarihu> True. I guess the whole reason for the shakycam has got to do with trying to establish a raw atmosphere for the movie. I see this in the new BSG and Stargate Universe iirc.
<RustyMeat> dat asssset
<CK|Catnap> Dat sniper?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He's going to bolt.

<SirGanjalf> Damn Snipers...
<StinkomanFan> ARG's ended man
<pony_245024> so noponys got nothing to help. awesome :<
<Kandarihu> I also see this in more recent video and computer games, too. Let's face it guys. Shakycam is in fashion.
<Barbetos> Oh cops. Jason must want to do some cardio
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01pony_245024: Help with what?
<CountDoofus> London?
<Sumica> 00,10he wants happy pictures Nittany_Discord
<CK|Catnap> Kandarihu: And it's fine, when it's done well and where it belongs.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Happy pictures?
<CK|Catnap> When it's in every single scene, it's just awful to watch.
<Sumica> 00,10yup
<RaveBrony> pony_245024: What happened? D:
<pony_245024> I need some pinkie pie smiles. It's been a horrible, horrible day. I just unfairly lost my job, and found out my brother was joining the navy.
<Kandarihu> Yeah. Shakycam when it's just people walking through doors or using the internet.

<Kandarihu> Gee. Jason Bourne is paranoid about being traced, but has no qualms about using Google. That's rather noobish of him.
<Meanwhile> pony_245024: You like stand-up?
<BlazeAngel> XD, Im watching the old batman show. Good stuff.
<StaticsCloud> uhhh panic panic panic!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: Product placement.
<CK|Catnap> Yeah, see these shots didn't need shaky cam. You don't need to add "action" to the scenes that are supposed to build the plot and explain what's happening. XP
<Bronysith> BlazeAngel: adam west is going to be at dragoncon
<pony_245024> I just dont know what to google. I dont know where to start. Even DJ PON-3 cant get me to smile...

<Barbetos> Actually, the amount of time he took to choke him I am sure he is just passed out. =\
<WindWhistler> The pen truly is mightier than the sword. You can use it to buy a tazer and knock out the swordsman.
<Kandarihu> Ikaruga, you, the bullets, and most of the enemies are either white or black. Being the same color as bullets absorbs them into missiles. Simple concept, LOTS of variety in the execution.

<Kandarihu> $4.99 for the game alone. $7.49 for the Ultimate Edition that includes the Awakening expansion and all DLC

<OtakuTom> Just so happens that my only way out of it involved getting blown up by like 5 creepers at once...
<OtakuTom> So I lost ALL of my tools
<OtakuTom> And a good 10 levels of exp

<Shizuka> 131am
<Shizuka> 13begin render
<Shizuka> 13estimated time, one hour
<Vordox> Shizuka: True time, 6 hours XD
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Shizuka> 1320 minute video, due to the countdown clock takes three times as long to render
<Vordox> Shizu: YOu sure your computer can handle it that fast?
<Shizuka> 13if it weren't for that countdown clock asuka would probably have it done in half an hour
<Polydunami> Oh geeze
<Shizuka> 13it's always longer than the actual video, but varies between twice and three times as long depending on how complex it is
