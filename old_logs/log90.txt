<Kosoveon> sometimes I just want to relax and unwind and not be p*ssed off unendlessly with an endless barrage of bullets ;P
<SilverSonic> ew some FPS games
<SilverSonic> (not including TF2 :P)
<SilverMane> ValtheJean, it's called plot-hook. wait for chapter 3
<Dman> JA OOBIOUSLEE, MAST BE DE MAGICKS
<ValtheJean> a plot hook? that's a pathetic excuse
<Kosoveon> well I was mainly talking about bullet hell shooters that i play LOL
<RobotPinkie> this chapter is looooooong
<ValtheJean> they should at least be chewed out for letting him go
<SilverMane> yes it is RobotPinkie
<Kosoveon> but I guess fpses too :P
<SilverMane> he's barely scratched the surface
<RobotPinkie> oh wow
<SilverMane> this is a 10 hour minimum game
<SilverMane> not to mention chapter 3, which is a 25 hour minimum game
<SilverMane> if you want to do EVERYTHING though, it'll be closer to 60 hours in chapter 3
<ValtheJean> oh gents
<ValtheJean> I present to you
<ValtheJean> Dari's favorite treat
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/ZoigbergCookies.jpg
<Dman> Yes?
<SilverMane> lol Val
<Dman> . . . 0__________0
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Dman> U mean RD cookies
<Dman> or perhaps something more cakey, and cupshaped
<SilverMane> mfw i had one of those
<SilverMane> and it was DELICIOUS
<SilverMane> and i was crying the whole time, in the shop
<RobotPinkie> testes?
<Kosoveon> speaking of which, the only fps that I've played that I really enjoy and have played multiple times is bioshock
<Dman> ... balls, cookies or cupcakes ,silvermane?
<SilverMane> freaked out the owner
<SilverMane> cupcakes
<Dman> ah thout so
<Kosoveon> and a lot of it is because of the story
<Dman> ...
<Dman> wow i just realised yah i would probably shed tears next time i eat cupcakes
<Ray> 02<Kosoveon> sometimes, I just want to play a easy-as-cake game <-- Doesn't apply with me .-.
<Dman> (only just read cupcakes today)
<SilverMane> yeah, they had cupcakes with sky blue frosing, rainbow sprinkles, and confetti-coloring in the cake
<SilverMane> and it had cake batter injected into the middle
<SilverMane> it was AMAZING
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<Kosoveon> Ray
<Ray> 02actually the more frustrating are the games, the more I play them |D
<Kosoveon> have you every tried sin and punishment?
<GGgala_> Dman: but cupcakes was hilarious!
<RobotPinkie> oh gods
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well all Kirby games are relatively easy, what makes this one any different? :P
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_491053&v=LcmBALxDkRY
<Ray> 02No gameover screen?
<Dman> GGgala_ was too! but away from it, letting my imagination wander and make the story gorier...i would cry for Rainbow Dash. I really would.
<Ziltoid> dont click on that
<Dman> ziltoid yfw i didn't
<Ray> 02also Kirby Super Star Ultra
<SilverMane> ninja... sex... party?
<Dman> yfw chrome addon allows pic to expand on mousehover
<Ziltoid> was a mistake
<Ray> 02At the real arena
<Ray> 02URGH
<Dman> U mad?
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<Ray> 02like 40 tries
<Dman> i no click but see fullsize : P
<Kosoveon> you know, epic yarn is easy, but there are other ways to find challenge in it
<Ray> 02but then success
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ok, the downside to Kirby's Epic Yarn is that you can't die
<ValtheJean> BECAUSE THEY'RE GOD DAMN BANDITS YOU FUCKING STUPID BITCH
<ValtheJean> jesus fucking CHRIST
<Angel_Espeon> 13but you DO lose pretty much everything you've collected in the level
<Kosoveon> like collecting those coins or whatever
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<GGgala_> wait, is one o the characters a chick?
<Kosoveon> where every time you get hit you lose some of your stash
<Ziltoid> lol GGgala
<GGgala_> i thought they were all just extremely girly men
<ValtheJean> I swear I feel like I'm banging my god damn head against a wall
<Dman> >only just seen this. http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oTHy_W1jeW4/TksikgqkkZI/AAAAAAAAKkg/NGlXmQ4qTec/s320/mail.google.com.jpg
<GGgala_> like Yu-Gi-Oh
<Dman> KAWAAAIIIIII
<Kosoveon> THAT is a challenge, the game itself isn't, but that's not necessarily a bad thing :3
<SilverMane> Dman, yeah, that was when i died last night
<GGgala_> SNEAKY LUNA IS SNEAKY
<Dman> ...died?
<SilverMane> Sneaky Luna > Luna in socks
<Ziltoid> dem crazy oc characters
<GGgala_> died from cute, Dman. from diabeetus
<SilverMane> yes, of a daww-attack
<Dman> happy luna > all lunas
<ValtheJean> only in a shitty flash game would some single dimensional female character need to be reassured the necessity of killing god damn bandits
<SilverMane> Dman, all my money
<RobotPinkie> Luna > All Lunas
<Dman> O.I.C.G.G. ... F.U.N.E.M.N.T.?
<SilverMane> ValtheJean, it wasn't about the Bandits, it was about killing Steele
<Ray> 02and the other thing that my friend said was that it was easy (for him, lol) was to complete at 100%
<Dman> robotpinkie has the truth right there
<Ray> 02(I hate him)
<SilverMane> bandits just came up as a point-of-reference
<ValtheJean> well sorry, but frankly she SHOULD be getting yelled at
<GGgala_> Dman: ...my brain is full of fuck. and i love it
<ValtheJean> seriously
<ValtheJean> because it's fucking stupid
<SilverMane> yes, probably, but they are trying to comfort the little murderer
<Ray> 02Y HE SO GOOD AT 100%-ing gaemz D:
<Dman> lul
<Kosoveon> another thing about the kirby games is that even those they are easy, they are at least trying a whole bunch of different scenarios and gameplay mechanics
<Dman> also new tab dari?
<RobotPinkie> My fuck is full of brains... and the zombie part of me loves it
<ValtheJean> oh good, let's comfort the bitch that just lightning zapped an ally for trying to kill A GOD DAMN BANDIT
<SilverMane> no Dman, he dropped his pants and it's blinding the camera
<Dermathil> Testicle cookies?
<Dman> hahahahaha!
<Dermathil> :3
<Ray> 02Yeah, I know that
<SilverMane> valtheJean, relax. seriously
<Kosoveon> i.e canvas curse with controlling kirby only with the stylus, epic yarn for the art design, mass attack for the fact you are controlling ten different kirbys
<Ray> 02I love Kirby games
<GGgala_> dammit dari, you know you have to contain your sexiness
<Dman> ...mouce shaking is actually him fapipng hitting mouse
<Ray> 02because THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING
<Light_Latias> 12Kirby <3
<Aeroslash> Kirby Kirby Kirby he's the star of the show~
<ValtheJean> I'm perfectly calm
<Ray> 02that takes me at least 40 tries to get/beat
<Dman> he opened up robotpinkie's vector. calling it!
<Aeroslash> Meta is cooler though~ :D
<ValtheJean> I'm also comfortable expressing my utter disdain for the script
*Light_Latias pokes Kirby 64 >.> <.<
<Aeroslash> come back when you start getting banned at Brawl tourniments~ >D
<Chimera> Nya
*Kosoveon likes Kirby 64 :<

<Dman> and lol sumica dat made me laugh
<Insane_Lugia> derp
<Dermathil> btw dari
<Glacymr> 12rawr
<Dermathil> you know what I think?
<prince-dari> ?
<Dermathil> I think that they sold out with Smith.
<EdwardNewgate> It did inspire massive amounts of D'awwwwwww
<Dermathil> Due to the Doctor Who going also in US tv now
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Dermathil> so they had to make a doctor that americans could also refer to
<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> <_<
<ValtheJean> eh, that comic is kinda meh
<Dman> ..¬_¬
<Dermathil> Kind of "Homer Simpsons" like
<Sumica> uh dr who has been in the US for ages man.
<Dman> valthejean it's really good imo
<prince-dari> That's why I like Harr Potter
<Dermathil> Well I hear more about him since he became Smith.
<Dman> Herr potter? mein vand is kaput!
<prince-dari> J.K insisting on British actors.
<ValtheJean> meh, plays too much on trying to be all mushy imo
<Insane_Lugia> lol he didnt even say good bye
<Dermathil> When Smith arrived, Suddenly I hear more about the US
<Sumica> they started showing it here reguarly sence this doctor here.
<Dman> errytime =D
<Dermathil> What I think is that it is the reason behind the green screwdriver
<Sumica> on scifi now called syfy
<prince-dari> >green screwdriver
<prince-dari> Don't bloody remind me.
<Dman> green is more US than blue?
<GGgala_> idungeddit
<Dermathil> It is a change
<Dman> also, again dari, it's a changing show >_<
<Dermathil> Dman, the screwdriver shouldn't have changed though.
<Dman> ohaider

<Dermathil> LOOK UP BLUE SHIFT
<Dman> Bro, A2 physics - quite aware of it
<prince-dari> I don't see why they changed it.
<Dermathil> I think that green is way shittier on the wavelength color scale
<prince-dari> They changed everything.
<prince-dari> The intro.
<Dman> (not enough space in like 2 meters for that shift to occur thou :Pbut eh it's the doctor
<prince-dari> The logo.
<prince-dari> The Doctor.
<prince-dari> The TARDIS./
<prince-dari> The screwdriver.
<Dermathil> wait.

<Dermathil> THEY CHANGED THE BLOODY TARDIS?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> They changed the inside.
<Dman> "Your brain's been wiped clean." "Oh yea? So's ...*glasses*... yer face."
<Dermathil> THE MOTHERF--ERS

<Dermathil> best traveller
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Aristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Dermathil> EVER
<Dman> marTHA
<prince-dari> "The show's high episode count resulted in Doctor Who holding the world record for the highest number of episodes for a science-fiction programme"
<ValtheJean> no wonder she works with the doctor :P
<Dermathil> marTHA is 2nd
<prince-dari> "For comparison, the Guinness World Record holder for the highest number of consecutive episodes, Stargate SG-1,[1] aired 214 episodes."
<Dman> yay~
<Sumica> figured sg1 wouuld be second
<prince-dari> 218 episodes total.
<Dermathil> yeah
<prince-dari> SG1s are consecutive though.
<Dermathil> SG-1's got 10 seasons
<prince-dari> Unlike Doctor Who's.
<prince-dari> >Final SG1 episode
<prince-dari> >crappy
<Dermathil> of 26 episodes each
<prince-dari> I was disappoint.
*Dman is gonna post some shiz. shiz no.1 : "Torchwood is mentioned by the police officer. The Doctor does not seem to notice. "
<Dermathil> dari
<ValtheJean> agreed dari
<GGgala_> >implying many episodes of SG1 weren't crappy
<Sumica> yeah ending sucked which is why they did a movie
<ValtheJean> fucking asgard fucking comitting mass suicide
<ValtheJean> so fucking out of character
<prince-dari> But it was the FINAL episode.
<prince-dari> It was supposed to be epic.
*Dman 's triviah: The Doctor drives a Vespa out of the TARDIS. This is the second time a vehicle has been shown leaving the TARDIS; the first time was in the TV Movie. This is the first time that a vehicle was shown to be kept inside the TARDIS (although the Eighth Doctor had a Volkswagen Beetle at one point)
<Dman> yay for treeveeah
<Sumica> ep 200 was best ep well that and the groundhog day like one
<ValtheJean> all it did was piss me off
<ValtheJean> the Asgard are like, the fucking best race ever
<ValtheJean> and they give them the most bullshit drama queen ending
<Dman> HORE SHEET
<Sumica> ahhh those people havent learned there specal tallent yet. so they have blank faces
*Dman 's mindblowing trivia : "It is often erroneously claimed that footage of Rose calling out from the TV set was recycled for her brief cameos in the Season 4 episodes The Poison Sky and Midnight. " ... we just saw that!
<Freyskol> I played Runescape.
<Freyskol> I got bored.
<Freyskol> Then I played World of Warcraft.
<Freyskol> I got bored.
<Dman> woooow : D
<Dermathil> 2011: 1 billion viewers
<Dman> =D
<Dman> HUNGREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Sumica> eeeeeeeeee
<Dermathil> ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Dman> twentee meeleeon
<GGgala_> she sure is hammy
*Dermathil smashes the tv.
<GGgala_> "i'm sorry, so sorry."
<Dman> Om nom nom
<GGgala_> TAKE A DRINK
<ValtheJean> did she died?
<prince-dari> YOU CAN'T!
<prince-dari> I JUST TRIED IT!
<Dman> sort of
<prince-dari> OH MAH GAWD!
<EdwardNewgate> I THINK SHE DIED
<Dermathil> LOL
*Dman 's triviah: The final rating was 6.76 million, making it the most watched programme of the day.
<Dman> TAL' T'ME
<prince-dari> The final rating of what?
<GGgala_> and that's how the interrogator became the interrogatee.
<Dermathil> >stands up
<Dman> (dari, guess ¬_¬)
<Dermathil> >interrogated becomes interrogator
<Dman> (this episode_
<Dman> ) *
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Dman> TAL' T'ME (facejacker)
<Dman> :P
<Dman> D:
<Dman> That actually made me a little scared first time i saw that
<Sumica> editing!
<EdwardNewgate> Is she in a morph suit, or did they just blur her face?
<Dman> Editing, the game!
<Dman> hmmmmm
<Sumica> clearly it's been shoped
<Dermathil> Doctor is pissed.
<Dermathil> DOCTOR IS REALLY PISSED
<prince-dari> More likely it's some kind of face mask thing.
<ValtheJean> seriously, can I get on the doctor's good side?
<ValtheJean> I want someone like that who'll get pissed the fuck off at my face being stolen
<prince-dari> A lot of the alieans are physical stuff rather than CGI.
<Dermathil> ^^
<Sumica> just look at the picture it's so nice
<Dman> She had it coming, let's ...*glasses*... face it.
<Dermathil> They are costumes most of the time
<Sumica> might have been the stream but it looked digital =p
<Dermathil> The Cybermen were costumes in many shots
<Dman> <3 foreverinlove with dari
<Dermathil> YAY
<FreezeFrame> Yay! More Feathers!
<prince-dari> TERRY TIBBS
<prince-dari> TALK TO MEH!
<Dman> TAL' T'ME
<Sumica> that was almost a brick joke guys
<Dman> !
*FreezeFrame likes Gilda redemptionfics that are done well.
<Dman> same
<EdwardNewgate> I like most fics that are well done
<ValtheJean> yeah, if I were the doctor I'd have shot him in the kneecap :P
<Sumica> why cant we have his face taken?
*Dman 's Doctor Who Triviah: All the television aerials seem to resemble Nazi swastikas. On the DVD commentary one of the set designers mentions that this was done to evoke the post-war era.
<FreezeFrame> I always thought Gilda could have been explored more.
<FreezeFrame> I hope we see more Gilda in season 2
<Dman> hmm, who will return u think for season 2?
<ValtheJean> eenope
<Dman> ah gilda
<FreezeFrame> Luna :P
<ValtheJean> I hate gilda
<Dman> and trixie? luna?
<Dman> I have one request: Luna
<ValtheJean> here's some fun trivia about gilda
<FreezeFrame> Luna is confirmed for Season 2
<ValtheJean> she calls all the ponies lame
<ValtheJean> in our world
<Dman> Y no rite -D
<Dman> =D
<ValtheJean> a Lame pony or horse is shot and killed
<GGgala_> .echo in every way possible
<Dman> ok
<ValtheJean> there's some perspective for you :P
<GGgala_> whoops wrong window
<Dman> this is cardiff btw
<FreezeFrame> Of course, I have a few favored pairings already, too >.>
<FreezeFrame> Like Ditzymac
<EdwardNewgate> Appledash is my OTP
<FreezeFrame> (Fluttermac is nice, too, but Ditzymac just seems right)
<Sumica> I here Val likes Caramac.
<Dman> valthejean provided perspective. like a baws. or a certain french critic who's last review was of a restaurant with food cooked by a Rat ; )
<FreezeFrame> Newgate: Appledash is nice, but I prefer Rarijack
<Dman> rarijack? i see
<EdwardNewgate> I just can't see rarijack
<GGgala_> Caramac isbest -mac
*Dman 's random stuff: "David Tennant mentioned on the DVD commentary that he accidentally hit the button on the sonic screwdriver prop while putting it into his pocket, causing the light to flicker on and "sonic-ing" himself. This is clearly visible on the episode itself. "
<FreezeFrame> Only pairing I don't particularly like is Twixie, because I think the Twilight/Trixie dynamic works better as sisters than lovers.
<EdwardNewgate> But I can see Appledash working really well
<ValtheJean> I hear Sumica likes to pleasure himself while being wedged between two asian midgets
<Glacymr> 12then you played...... TF2
<Glacymr> 12and got bored
<Dman> lolwut
<Dman> valthejean wut

<Dman> om nom nom.
<GGgala_> delicious pretty-boy
<Sumica> old guy in hat just craped him self
<Dman> xD
<FreezeFrame> I'm surprised no one's written a fanfic dealing with Dash being polyamorous.
<Sumica> poly what now?
<GGgala_> FreezeFrame: that has happened though. With Braeburn and Little Strongheart
<FreezeFrame> Basically, polyamory is the idea of being in love with more than one person at once.
<Dman> polywhatnow
<Dman> ah
<Dman> well ive read one freezeframe
<Dman> i can find if u want
<EdwardNewgate> Come on, bronies wanting ponies to be polyamorous, yeah right
<GGgala_> poly- = many. amory = amorous = love
<Dman> wher she in love with vinyl and fluttershy
<FreezeFrame> As long as it's not cloppy
<Dman> srs drama in that one if u want it freezeframe
<EdwardNewgate> or poligimous
<Dman> not clop at all
<Dman> want me to go dig it up freezeframe?
<Dermathil> SONIC SCREWDRIVER OFF
<Dman> OH SNAP
<FreezeFrame> Newgate: If anypony were to be poly, it would be Dash
<Sumica> you know what, i dont think I have ever seen that woord writen out.
<EdwardNewgate> Oh, I know. I just can't see bronies wanting a pony to be poly
<Dman> well freezeframe does that interest you?

<prince-dari> Someone needs to make a satnav that just says "HUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNGREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
<Dman> Billions and Billions
<EdwardNewgate> Actually, you know what. I don't think Dash would be poly. I think she's a jealous lover

<Dman> OH GOD IT
<ValtheJean> inception ripped off a lot of things...
<Dman> ULTIMATE. FREAKIN'. SPIDERMAN.
<Dman> >huuuungreeeeee
<GGgala_> Dman: what was the voice?
<GGgala_> oh'
<prince-dari> Apparently the inception soundtrack is just the song they play to let them know when they need to wake up slowed down loads.
<GGgala_> the new cartoon?
<Dman> that gggala_ : ) and the videogame
<GGgala_> the stupid new cartoon? that should never have replaced Spectacular Spider-Man?
<Dman> the videogame! >_P<
<Dermathil> actually dari, the soundtrack's got a lot more tunes than just that one.
<Dman> prince-dari yea, but actually (vids on youtbue with editing software) there's a lot more than just slown down
<Sumica> you have to climb DEEEEEPER!

<GGgala_> *.gif
<Dman> Magpie Electricals apparently continues to exist beyond the death of Mr. Magpie; Martha Jones had a Magpie brand television in DW: The Sound of Drums, and a Magpie brand microphone can be seen in Voyage of the Damned. The new TARDIS interior, after it repaired itself following the events of DW: The End of Time has some parts made by Magpie Electricals. Magpie
<Dman> apparently continues to thrive into the future, as a large sign with the company's logo can be seen aboard Starship UK in DW: The Beast Below.
<Dman> mind = blown.

<Dman> lol
<GGgala_> WELL THIS SCENE SURE IS CONVENIENT
<Dermathil> Suddenly the explosion in the TARDIS was caused by an instantaneous release of all of Tennant's awesome all at once
<GGgala_> Luckily everyone gets a happy ending by complete coincidence
<Sumica> that man has the most blue suit I have ever seen
<Dman> Now why you gon' be hatin' smith

<prince-dari> I only want to see that if Samuel L. Jackson kills Matt Smith.
<Kosoveon> i...i am?
<prince-dari> FreezeFrame: Lies
<Dman> in before the lock. the locking of the doors.
<FreezeFrame> dari: Truths
<prince-dari> River Song is the best part.
<ValtheJean> okay like him or not, that would be pretty fucking epic
<Dman> freezeframe hahaha that's pretty accurate
<prince-dari> River Song easilly outshine any other character.
<prince-dari> easily*
<prince-dari> outshines*
<ValtheJean> just because ever since the bullshit of Star Wars Ep3, I've been meaning to see Samuel kick someone's ass
<Sumica> we can hear you faping

<FreezeFrame> Amy's Choice
<prince-dari> Rory is pretty cool yeah, but River Song is even more awesome than EVERYONE.
<Dman> aww 'BURN WITH ME' is season 3
<FreezeFrame> River is the combined awesome of Rory and Amy
<GGgala_> obviously River is Rory and Amy's future baby

<GGgala_> TO SERVE MAN
<ValtheJean> well, other than myself I didn't realize there was anyone who hasn't seen these

*Dman pouts
<ValtheJean> so now
<Sumica> refreshment would be nice, so would a change of shorts
<ValtheJean> if Dr. Who is a time traveller
<Dman> people out of nowhere - DE MAGICKS
<ValtheJean> does he run across his other selves?
<Dman> valthejean - no, but in 2 or 3 specials for charity events yes
<Dman> he knows not to mess with that shiz, bro
<ValtheJean> so he NEVER goes into the same times?
<Dman> (charity event specials can be canon, but mostly they are comical :3)
<ValtheJean> well what about his comment: "I've seen the lunar landing 5 times" or whatever
<ValtheJean> doesn't that run a risk?
<Dman> valthejean - in a charity special he meets his like 8th regeneration, so his past self.
<Sumica> I see new people
<Dman> apparently its risky valthejean, but it's time travellan, ain't gotta clue
<EdwardNewgate> Dman, you mean the 5th doctor?
<FreezeFrame> Isn't 8 the one that most fans memory-holed? :P
<Dman> also >oods. why they slaves? ;) ;)
<Dman> Edwardnewgate probably
<FreezeFrame> Dman: Remember this episode

<stripes> ok, that was a copy paste job..
<stripes> i will be slower
<stripes> If a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Mouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Units).
<stripes> Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.
<stripes> Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will belarger and harder than foreign balls.
<stripes> Ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop off method. Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist off method.
<stripes> Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.
<stripes> Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used immediately
<stripes> It is recommended that each person have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.
<stripes> Any customer missing his balls should contact the local personnel in charge of removing and replacing these necessary items.
<stripes> Please keep in mind that a customer without properly working balls is an unhappy customer

<stripes> joan had just got a job at the ticke-me-elmo factory and was told to report to work the following morning, about 10am the following day the floor supervisor went to
<stripes> the manager.
<stripes> furious, he said "that new lady, joan, she
<stripes> has to go, we are falling so far behind in production i dont know what to do."
<stripes> so the manager went down to the production room and was horified to find the line backed up everywhere, and he watched joan grab a piece of red material used for making the tickle-me-elmo
<stripes> put 2 marbles in it and sew the little sac between elmo's legs. after regaining his composure the manager went over to joan and said, dear,
<stripes> i thing you mis-understood what you are
<stripes> to do, your job is to give elmo "two test tickles"

<Ziltoid> hi rodman
<Pegacorn> It's so nostalgic for me.
<Pegacorn> It brings me back to the first Sonic game i ever played.
<Pegacorn> Sonic Heroes was BAWS back then.
<Pegacorn> It still is.
<Pegacorn> Most of it due to nostalgia.
<Rodman> Weird, I don't recall this song
*Dman is looking through hair styling general for his fluttershy <3
<Rodman> You sure its a Sonic Heroes' song?
<Pegacorn> "What i'm made of",the final boss song from Sonic Heroes.
<Rodman> Ah, vs Metal Sonic
<Rodman> I remember now
<Ziltoid> never played sonice heroes
<Pegacorn> MEGA Metal Sonic.
<Ziltoid> when was it released?
<Rodman> MEGA Metal Sonic. Trufax
<Pegacorn> 2005.
<Ziltoid> Oh.
<Pegacorn> Or was it 2003?
<Ziltoid> nope
<Pegacorn> I don't remember.I'mma check Wikipedia.
<Ziltoid> The last sonic game I played was on the gamecube
<Ziltoid> its was called sonic battle 2 or something
<Ziltoid> And you fought a giant space monster
<Ziltoid> tentacle
<Pegacorn> Sonic Heroes was released in 2004.

<RobotPinkie> ohai barry
<Sathi> 7In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
<Razyn> I am tenacious. No matter what task I am given, it will be done.
<Barry> I had gone on a wak
<Barry> walk*
<Sathi> 7What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
<Rodman> You guys seen this?

<RobotPinkie> HAHA, amazing
<Razyn> Leaving BMN itself as is would most likely be for the best. But having events every now and then, like the upcoming LoTR, is the perfect way to garner more viewers. Perhaps seasonal events i.e. monster movie marathon in Halloween.
<Rodman> Don't Stop Me Now FTWMFW
<Razyn> -would be fun.
<Sathi> 7Any other ideas?
<Razyn> No, not at the moment.
<RobotPinkie> Best Queen song
<Sathi> 7Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
<mib_yxrbh3> The stream on?
<Razyn> I just want to help in any way I can. BMN has become a big part of my life, and if there's anything I can do to ensure it stays up and running a smoothly as possible, then I want in.
<RobotPinkie> Nope, not right now.

<RainBroDash> 10xD
<ValtheJean> saw a few other eps here on the stream

<Dermathil> RobotPinkie, don't bother. I'm pretty sure he's not gonna latch onto it.
<RobotPinkie> I know it sounds girly, but if you give it a chance it's really quite good
<ValtheJean> seriously, anyone who watches it should immediately lose their mancard
<Umbreon> 12do you have a Last-call return feature?
<RobotPinkie> Aw okay, yeah I guess that was a bit of a reach. :(
<ValtheJean> >is EXACTLY what I said to people before becoming a FiM fan btw
<Soital> 12I do, but all it says is "withheld"
<ValtheJean> well, the mancard part
<ValtheJean> not the others

<ValtheJean> OMG GUISE, I FUKKEN LOVE PONIES
<RainBroDash> 10valthejean, I'm pretty much abandoning ponies when i go off to uni
<RobotPinkie> I just thought bronies sounded.... really not like my kind of people :P
<Soital> 12The fact that they're withholding their number increases the chances that I already have them saved on my contacts
<Soital> 12or its just a number they don't want me to have
<ValtheJean> whaaaaaaaaaa?
<Soital> 12but still wtf is the point in hanging up if I answer it .w.

<lighty> Me? In the netherlands
<Soital> 12yeah, ah I see owo
<EdwardNewgate> inb4 never. I really dislike most of the movie
<Soital> 12they hardly sell dr pepper... D:
<Quanyails> 7Okay, well, my parents' laptop boots and ends up on a screen without any options, just a _ cursor like the command prompt.
<EdwardNewgate> Although one more thing. When the kids always says booby twaps
<lighty> Were do you come from soital?
<Quanyails> 7Pressing keys gets the laptop to beep.
<EdwardNewgate> but that's it
<ValtheJean> mmmhmm
<Soital> 12England :P
<ValtheJean> sure
<drfsupercenter> 03do you have a CD in the drive or a flash drive plugged in?
<lighty> Neat :3
<Quanyails> 7Nope.
<drfsupercenter> 03hm.
<EdwardNewgate> The hate stems mostly from the fact I was forced to watch it over and over with my little brother. It completely killed the movie for me
<drfsupercenter> 03usually that means it's not attempting to boot from the hard drive, which is usually caused if y9ou have something else plugged in that's attempting to be booted instead
<drfsupercenter> 03what type of laptop is it?
<Quanyails> 7Dell Vostro 2510. o.O
<drfsupercenter> 03Dell, hm,
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, wait:
<Quanyails> 7I have a USB mouse attatched to the laptop.
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03that shouldn't matter.
<Umbreon> 12hi drf
<Quanyails> 7Okay, just checking.
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't boot from a mouse LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so
<drfsupercenter> 03turn it off, turn it back on and press F12 repeatedly.
<drfsupercenter> 03see if a menu pops up.
<lighty> My pc CAN boot from my mouse
<Quanyails> 7Yep, I've gotten that.
<Quanyails> 7What happens then?
<drfsupercenter> 03<lighty> My pc CAN boot from my mouse <- What the frick?
<lighty> It has 512KB memory for special setups xD
<drfsupercenter> 03Quanyails, tell it to boot from the hard drive
<drfsupercenter> 03see if that works
<lighty> Its a Roccat Cone[+]
<drfsupercenter> 03also wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03even more reasons to hate 5th generation Pokémon
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun2> lul lesbian pokemon
<drfsupercenter> 03> wtf bluesun2?
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun2> latest ep showed two Vuljina/Mandibuzz sharing a nest, one larger with a deep voice, and one smaller with a higher voice
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun2> now you'd assume they're male and female... but Vuljina are a female-only species
<Quanyails> 7Same thing. o.o
<lighty> Holy...
<Quanyails> 7Black screen, _ like the command prompt.
<drfsupercenter> 03hm.

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL typical Asians
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03there are basically two options
<Ziltoid> what?
<Quanyails> 7Mmm-hmm?
<Satheria> the chat died
<drfsupercenter> 03that blinking cursor means either your hard drive or the operating system is corrupted.
<drfsupercenter> 03The easiest is to just lose all data and reinstall Windows.
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<drfsupercenter> 03If you have data you don't want to lose, however
*RobotPinkie gives chat mouth to mouth
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows XP has a repair mode built in
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why I asked what version, as XP is the latest one to have that feature
<drfsupercenter> 03where it will attempt to fix your OS without erasing data.
<Quanyails> 7I see.
<Razyn> 0It's not dead, it just has low health
<Quanyails> 7How do I accessi t?
<Quanyails> 7it*
<EdwardNewgate> twists he evil mustache
<drfsupercenter> 03you need an XP disc.
<lighty> My win7 x64 had a feature like that too i think.....
<Quanyails> 7Yep, got that.
<drfsupercenter> 03lighty, no
<EdwardNewgate> his
*ValtheJean stabs chat. Mistaking it for Durrgarr
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows Vista and 7 do not have a bootable repair install

<drfsupercenter> 03you can do a repair installation with 7 but you have to be able to boot into Windows first, which in this case...
<lighty> Alright

<TheSniper> RobotPinkie, I've come for my check. Now spit it out ya wanker!
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm

<Quanyails> 7Well, thanks for the help.
<drfsupercenter> 03no problem
<drfsupercenter> 03if for some reason, that doesn't work
<Quanyails> 7Annoyed that my mom continues to not want to back up her data elsewhere. >>
<drfsupercenter> 03assuming you have another computer (which I'm going to assume you do)
<drfsupercenter> 03you can do what I usually do
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<drfsupercenter> 03which is download a Linux CD
<Quanyails> 7Which is?
<drfsupercenter> 03burn it
<drfsupercenter> 03boot from it
<drfsupercenter> 03tha twill let you get access to all the data
<drfsupercenter> 03then back it up somewhere
*RobotPinkie eats sniper rifle
<drfsupercenter> 03external hard drive, flash drive, whatever
<RobotPinkie> Problem solved
<drfsupercenter> 03then reinstall WIndows the normal way.
<Quanyails> 7Hmm!
<ValtheJean> phfff...fine then
<drfsupercenter> 03^ that's also the reason why Windows passwords are 100% useless
<ValtheJean> I wont die heroically for you
<Quanyails> 7So how do I get a Linux CD/burn one? :P

*drfsupercenter thinks
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh lulz
<ValtheJean> yeah, shoulda mentioned I'm half Xenomorph
<drfsupercenter> 03the catch is, most Linux versions don't like laptop wireless which means you couldn't get online
<drfsupercenter> 03if you can get online, you can use Mibbit as usual :P
<drfsupercenter> 03so m

<Quanyails> 7That's the CD?
*ValtheJean traps RobotPinkie in the facehugger room
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Quanyails> 7Okay, burn that simply onto a CD, and then what?
<drfsupercenter> 03put it in the laptop, use F12 again, and this time press boot from CD
<Quanyails> 7Okay.

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Umbreon> 12mail the cd yet drf?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's more the fact that you brought two laptops
<Quanyails> 7And a few hours of time I have before my parents pick me up.
<ValtheJean> phfff, I've already left you
<drfsupercenter> 03Umbreon, I just woke up LOL

<ValtheJean> lies
<Umbreon> 12not to send the code with the disk XD
<drfsupercenter> 03too late
<drfsupercenter> 03why?
<Umbreon> 12incase someone else gets the mail for whatever reason
<lighty> Im off, gnite all
<drfsupercenter> 03I always put my serial numbers in the case for the disd
*RobotPinkie puts some facehuggers on his portable grill
<Pegacorn> So,anything happened while i was gone?

<RobotPinkie> Who's for hugburgers?
<Umbreon> 12disd~
<EdwardNewgate> World peace
<Quanyails> 7When I boot up the linux CD, what do I do then?
<drfsupercenter> 03you tell it to do a live boot, which should be the default optiojn
<drfsupercenter> 03*option
<ValtheJean> awwww
<Pegacorn> I mean really,did anything unusual happen while i was gone?
<Ziltoid> who is streaming?
<drfsupercenter> 03then all you'd need to do is go into Computer (same like with Windows), find XXGB hard drive, and open it
<Quanyails> 7'kay.
<drfsupercenter> 03and assuming the hard drive itself is not broken
<drfsupercenter> 03you should be able to see all the files
<ValtheJean> well, I ruptured the contents of Rainbrodash's insides
<drfsupercenter> 03if it gives you some error and the drive won't open
<drfsupercenter> 03THEN you're screwed. LOL
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<ValtheJean> it WAS Sathi at one point
<Quanyails> 7Well, that stinks for my mom. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03well no. Nothing on a computer is ever permanently broken. Buy yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03wel
<drfsupercenter> 03*well
<EdwardNewgate> And apparently RobotPinkie cooked us some unusual looking burgers
<drfsupercenter> 03do you know if she moves it around a lot while it's turned on?
<Pegacorn> Wow.
*Sathi needs to get stuff fixed before tomorrow..
<Quanyails> 7Nope.
<ValtheJean> ah, will you be streaming on friday then?
<Quanyails> 7The laptop's suffered from being used by multiple people in the house.
<drfsupercenter> 03no as in you don't know or she doesn't?
<Umbreon> 12sigh
<Umbreon> 12why does the DMV in my area
<Quanyails> 7And had a lot of junk and stuff on it.
<Sathi> most likely yes
<Barry> Hi Pega
<Umbreon> 12have to be like the only DMV for miles
<Pegacorn> I think i know why those burgers are unusual looking.They're made with facehuggers.
<Sathi> that's why i'm having testruns today
<Quanyails> 7Half of it some engineering programs.
<Umbreon> 12trying to get an early appointment is murder
<ValtheJean> best of luck then!

<Quanyails> 7Problem I have at the moment is that my laptop borked so I can't go on it.
<Quanyails> 7And I'm limited in how much time I can use on this alternate computer.
<Quanyails> 7So we're holding off on the RP until later today.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL, implying an RP is more important than fixing your computer
<Quanyails> 7Eh, it's not mine. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03well then again, my computers are so important they're top priority for me.

<Ziltoid> Well for one multiple chat rooms would be nice
<ValtheJean> rustiness gets swept away in the awesomeness :P
<Ziltoid> Or get that chat room cap fixed
<Insane_Lugia> prob lurking knowing her. she did say she lurked for a week before an appearances to get a good vibe of everyone.
<Sathi> Any other ideas?
<EdwardNewgate> mfw now I need to find my D2 cd
<RobotPinkie> hopefully online still works in wine
<ValtheJean> if you register it on bnet, you never need the cds again
<Ziltoid> along wiht perhaps message throlling so the chat isnt as spammy
<RobotPinkie> cool, I might do that
<ValtheJean> did it for D2,WC3 and Starcraft
<ValtheJean> works great, especially since my Brood War cd is cracked
<Ziltoid> I could also look into how I could stream aswell
<EdwardNewgate> Most def gonna do that
<Ziltoid> if needby
<Insane_Lugia> anybody see the news about susen b anthony?
<Sathi> Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?

<Ziltoid> SO I could contribute to the brony communinty and help bronystate because more awesome
<Ziltoid> become*
<RobotPinkie> I haven't played the series much since the first one, lol
<EdwardNewgate> I know I have WC3 and Starcraft lying around here somewhere
<ValtheJean> ah
<ValtheJean> well, definitely has been improved :P
<Sathi> Do you have any previous IRC experience?
<ValtheJean> you know, not having to build roads and such :P
<RobotPinkie> I mean I've tried WC2 and WC3, but I haven't played through them
<RobotPinkie> Ahh, nostalgia
<ValtheJean> mmhmm
<Ziltoid> Not much but surely it cant be that hard
<ValtheJean> btw, Frozen Throne was a brilliant expo
<ValtheJean> seriously
<ValtheJean> GREAT addition to the Warcraft story/gameplay

<RobotPinkie> it's out of print, at least here
<ValtheJean> RBD...eh...I don't even remember. I played competitively for like, a week then ran out of time
<RobotPinkie> or out of production
<RainBroDash> 10valthejean we can't connect cross-versions if you live in the US..:< I'm EU/Russia
<ValtheJean> I played the fuck out of the BETA though
*Insane_Lugia allows junh to recover and doesnt finish him as a act of murcy on behalf of him attacking me
<RainBroDash> 10ha nice
<ValtheJean> yeah, but sometimes (like in SC1) I played on other servers
<Ziltoid> if posted during a movie that could warrent a warning
<ValtheJean> >yfw I tell you I played on Korean servers :P
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<Ziltoid> Not really a huge deal otherwise
<RainBroDash> 10mfw you had a 1-999999 win-loss ratio
<ValtheJean> though god...if I went back to SC1 now
<ValtheJean> lol, that would be it if I went back now
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<ValtheJean> though I managed to hold my own
<RainBroDash> 10I'm a mega casual at SC2
