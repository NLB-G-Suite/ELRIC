<twilight_sprinkle> StinkomanFan: broker

<Saturn> 08,01killerpony7733: cheers, i'll look into it <3
<sonicdude558> SIR YES SIR
<NocturnalBlade> buuuuutttt slaaaaam
<twilight_sprinkle> pamela anderson vs someone ive never heard of
<killerpony7733> Saturn No problem but it tells me it's probably someone who thinks they are trolling..
<DerpyMuffins> Wtf are we watching?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Uh
<sonicdude558> dunno
<Kinixys> Look at the sign in the back..
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i dont know DerpyMuffins...i dont know 0_o
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, i have zero idea
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kinixys, Holeywomb. what even
<superretroworld> finally my internet isnt lagging anymore
<sonicdude558> vroom vroom baby
<Phase4> i think its some kind of commercial
<MLP_Brovakiin> Alrightly I am off now, take care everyone :)
<StinkomanFan> Fisher vs Hunter
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye MLP_Brovakiin
<twilight_sprinkle> yes its a russian chip advertisement
<thelonepony> Night MLP_Brovakiin :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye MLP_Brovakiin
<Phase4> twilight_sprinkle, best chip advert ever
<Kinixys> bye MLP_Brovakiin.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Looks like Dick Cheney vs someone else
<DerpyMuffins> So this is all a chip commercial?
<NocturnalBlade> bye MLP_Brovakiin
<twilight_sprinkle> yes DerpyMuffins
<pony_3431> what... does this have to do with chips?
<Phase4> srsly, if more advertising agencys did stuff like this i'd buy more stuff
<otakon> Hunchback vs. Chef?
<twilight_sprinkle> turtle vs cook
<DerpyMuffins> All this just to sell chips?
<PeachStreak> I'm back
<NocturnalBlade> wb PeachStreak
<otakon> oh no it's a turtle vs. chef
<Phase4> THIS IS A KNOIFE
<otakon> DerpyMuffins: why not?
<Kinixys> That's generally how it works. They just have to get your attention.
<Saturn> 08,01killerpony7733: you were right; lemoncake was permabanned twice before
<thelonepony> mexican vs someone...
<Phase4> Kinixys, better to get my attention by being funny than by being loud (ie: most other advertising)
<twilight_sprinkle> macho vs retard i guess is the best translation
<StinkomanFan> Tends to be a Draw a lot don't it?
<Bronysith> Saturn: how do they avoid permabans?
<Bronysith> Saturn: this is like the second time ive seen someone who was permabanned around back in chat
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: believe so
<DerpyMuffins> He gives no fuck
<DashWithRainbows> Bronysith usually people go onto a computer at a different location.
<killerpony7733> Saturn Hah i knew it. But yeah i remember it i saw the clop fic text copy pasta all that time back. But yeah probably someone who thinks they actually can troll
<Saturn> 08,01he doesn't anymore
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: i know so, i speak russian
<Kinixys> They just go through a proxy or something?
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: and they arent smart enough to change their names?
<DashWithRainbows> Some try
<Saturn> 08,01Kinixys: simpler than that; they just log on from another IP address
<StinkomanFan> Po vs dued from Mortal Kombat?
<Saturn> 08,01so i've done a ban on the nick lemoncake now
<DashWithRainbows> Suddenly a Domo o3o
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: just that the second word didnt have a precise translation afaik
<DerpyMuffins> Po vs Mortal Kombat?
<Kinixys> Ohh.. this is Lui Kang?
<Saturn> 08,01honestly, if someone is really persistent at ban evading, there's nothing we can do
<twilight_sprinkle> kung fu panda vs some kung fu guy ive not heard of
<thelonepony> oh okay, thanks twilight_sprinkle :)
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah lui kang would be him i guess
<Phase4> Kinixys, we've actually had an ip conflict before, someone was banned because their ip was the same as a pervious ban
<Bronysith> liu kang is cheap
<otakon> Napolean vs. King George?
<sonicdude558> so Saturn, what if he changes his nick to Lemoncake`? Will he get on?
<Dark_Horst> napoleon vs who?
<sonicdude558> Just sayin

<J_E_Smith71> Chokes
<sonicdude558> crap

<otakon> La Croissant!
<Saturn> 08,01just ban again if he resurgaces
<Saturn> 08,01*resurfaces
<prince-dari> Well we can blanket ban his area/ISP
<Phase4> suddenly chips
<DashWithRainbows> Whoa
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: yes, but we don't do that
<DashWithRainbows> Whoa, whoa, whoa
<prince-dari> Yes, we do, and have before.
<DerpyMuffins> They must be really desperate to sell chips in Russia
<twilight_sprinkle> general vs zombie
<DashWithRainbows> Dari should be in school right now...
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: we shouldn't

<twilight_sprinkle> DemoPegono: its not a big deal, a lot of people here arent 18
<Domo> I tried to get other video captures, but none of them wanted to work D: so manycam is all I got
<DashWithRainbows> Dken2021 Youngest here I think is 14.

<Dken2021> ohai Flaria, just seen ya

<sonicdude558> oh no

<Canadian_Brony> RoboGerbil eeyup. Domo is part of the Art Team and is doing some drawing for us.
<oni_link|sick> Silver_Soother: I know what youre going through. Drama surrounds me every week. This is where I go to unwind :3

<cachi01> RoboGerbil: she is not takin requests anymore
<oni_link|sick> Scoot-Scootaloo is MLG
<Dken2021> I think her mane's always straight XD
<Silver_Soother> I couldn't do like Domo is drawing... Though, that's probably because I am a novice artist. And I can't call myself an artist without laughing at my own words.
<storm-wind55> next is luna
<Stormy> :)
<RoboGerbil> zechoras got that dumb mohawk
<RoboGerbil> naw more liek the nightmare night eps
<Stormy> I'm gonna go watch another movie; I'll talk to you guys later
<CrimsonPhoenix> Silver_Soother, do you hate your art to a point where it makes you want to get better?
<Stormy> Make sure you come back again Swaffy :P
<Swaffy> Aww. Okay.

<storm-wind55> so how many of you think discord is coming back in the next season
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lyre**
<Swaffy> See you later.
<Cades> See ya Stormy
<Silver_Soother> CrimsonPhoenix: I hate my art, but others say it is good. I keep trying to get better, but I need real pencils or something more then Crayola pencils.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Silver_Soother, then you're a good artist in my book
<RoboGerbil> crayola is best pencils
<Silver_Soother> CrimsonPhoenix: :) If you say.
<RoboGerbil> Silver_Soother: but you may be better off with an airbrush?
<cachi01> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8322/
<RoboGerbil> lol not the bees
<Saturn> 08,01what?
<Canadian_Brony> ohai Saturn
<Silver_Soother> RoboGerbil: Airbrush? As I said, I am a novice at art. I don't know anything about it. :(
*RoboGerbil pokes Saturn
<thelonepony> ohai Saturn :)
<cachi01> hi Saturn :)
<Swaffy> Kimori
<CrimsonPhoenix> Domo D:
<Domo> ?
<Saturn> 08,01hi RoboGerbil!
<DerpyMuffins> So is Domo done?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I kinda wanted her to play it tele....oh nvm it's beautifull
<Saturn> 08,01and thelonepony!
<Saturn> 08,01and cachi01!
<Saturn> 08,01and Domo!
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Saturn
<RoboGerbil> lol he didnt say hi to Canadian_Brony
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Saturn4
<Silver_Soother> Late salutations Saturn friend.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Damn keyboard
<Domo> Hello~ And Ohh oAo ok. Do you want me to change it, CrimsonPhoenix?
<Canadian_Brony> RoboGerbil *shrugs*
<CrimsonPhoenix> If possible yes
<Domo> Ok!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want her to play the lyre with magic
<CrimsonPhoenix> telekinetically
<Canadian_Brony> Domo are you going to link the images when you're done?
<thelonepony> ^
<DerpyMuffins> Kinda want that Luna pic
<RoboGerbil> why no sound?
<CrimsonPhoenix> because manycam is a bitch
<RoboGerbil> :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....wait, I think I remember the sound solution with many cam
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause I don't think manycam has a sound recorder
<RoboGerbil> solution: use better software
<cachi01> ^
<Canadian_Brony> seems legit
<cachi01> i tried using manycam once
<CrimsonPhoenix> sound input should obviously be stereomix
<CrimsonPhoenix> obviously
<Dken2021> eeyup
<Dken2021> also, I'm eating baked potatoes at 10pm for no reason
<Saturn> 08,01why are Faure's and Durufle's requiems often on CDs together?
<Saturn> 08,01that's not the lead-in to a joke
<RoboGerbil> mmm at least its niot 10am
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just genuinely perplexed
<Swaffy> *sigh* Je ne sais pas quoi faire en ce moment.
<Dken2021> do they sound similar?
<RoboGerbil> does Saturn ever do live reading?
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn I don't even know who Faure and Durufle are, and I have a loose idea of what a requiem is.
<Dken2021> requiems are usually songs with a melancholy feeling
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: do you have spotify?
<Canadian_Brony> nnope
<storm-wind55> i dare everyone in this chat to watch this without crying or tearing up http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRQLcwhNsKM&feature=related
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: go find yourself a recording of Faure's Requiem
<Saturn> 08,01and listen to it all
<cachi01> REQUIEM FOR A DREAM HAZ BEST SOUNDTRACK
<Saturn> 08,01you'll be a better man for it
<RoboGerbil> requiems are bestquiems
<Silver_Soother> storm-wind55: Don't put links to videos in chat during streams if you were so kind.
<Dken2021> >Using FFX's opening theme
<Dken2021> always expect crying
<Kimori> ?
<cachi01> FFX theme is beautiful
<CrimsonPhoenix> storm-wind55, I know that comic
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn k, I'll write it down . . . somewhere . . .
<CrimsonPhoenix> beautifull
<RoboGerbil> anyone else read both cupcakes and rocket to insanity?
<storm-wind55> i did
<EmoRarity> Cupcakes is the reason I'm a brony today.
<RoboGerbil> did you feel worse after rocket to insanity?
<RoboGerbil> cuz cupcakes wasnt that bad to me but after rocket, i felt sick
<Saturn> 08,01i'm trying to find a recording of Faure's Requiem which has choral direction i agree with
<Saturn> 08,01i.e. the choir is directed as i'd conduct them
<cachi01> EmoRarity: same here
<storm-wind55> kinda but i read rocket to insanity first
<crazypony> rocket to insanity was scarier then cupcakes to me
<cachi01> EmoRarity: cupcakes and the pony.movs
<Canadian_Brony> Can we please not digress on the topic of "those" fics?

<HoodyNinja> I now have 69 songs on my playlist
<Swaffy> Was bored so I got food. Wanted to ask Kimori what it's like being the owner of this thing.
<Ponies47> Hey Domo do you have a DA by any chance? If so what is it? So I can follow it
<Saturn> 08,01i think it's when that other lass took it over
<Canadian_Brony> I can't read fan-fics for very long. I get droned out by long lines of text on a computer monitor.
<HoodyNinja> Immaturity level: Internet
<storm-wind55> i know right
<oni_link|sick> So deadline for this chiptune compo im in is the 30th. I have already submitted a cover and now I have to create an original piece. Im stressing out. I dont think I can do it. Im going through musical writers block :c
<Saturn> 08,01you could tell that the writing style had changed
<Kimori> oh
<storm-wind55> yeah
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: What are your overall views of the fanfic?
<RoboGerbil> Canadian_Brony: thats why theres readings on youtube
<CrimsonPhoenix> storm-wind55, Background Pony is 1000 times better
<Kimori> I'm not really sure what to say, wasnt expected to get a question like that..
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Canadian_Brony: That's why I exist! ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> Different views for different people.
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: i *love* fanfic

<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Okay. I was considering reading it, and I wanted someone's opinion on it. :)
<Kimori> Just surprised I guess
<HoodyNinja> CHAT-CEPTION
<storm-wind55> it was a very good fanfic
<Swaffy> Oh.

<Saturn> 08,01i love comedy fics, sad fics, some OTT gore fics, but i'm a real sucker for sappy romance

<NullRadix> Silver_Soother: was there a particular genre you preferred?
<Silver_Soother> Any genre, I'm easy going when it comes to stories.
<storm-wind55> there was one more but i can't remeber the name of it
<HoodyNinja> I seem to be picky as hell...
<NullRadix> assuming you know about Fallout: Equestria and moving on...
<Cades> You know why he/she got banned?
<Silver_Soother> NullRadix: I haven't read that many Fanfics.
<Kimori> who?
<Canadian_Brony> I'm going to get a Blackberry: Playbook primarily because I can read fan-fics off fimfiction.net, Google Docs, and the Pony Fiction Vault, which is are my primary sources for fan-fics.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/284/2/c/lyra_and_bonbon__lyra_is_in_trouble_by_rndfax-d5hgt4p.png
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: :D
<NullRadix> Silver_Soother: Fallout: Equestria is one of those "kinda big" things. Might want to look it up if you're looking for an epic
<Cades> The person you said got banned

<Silver_Soother> NullRadix: Will do friend.
<Dken2021> actually, it's more likely than you think
<Kimori> oh, I'm sure some were banned here before
<Kimori> Thats why I said it was before my time
<Kimori> I don't know what the peoples names are
<Kimori> I figured that if you were banned on the forums it would be the same here
<NullRadix> On A Cross and Arrow was a medium-sized fic I recall being fun. Twi ports the group to an R63 alternate dimension
<Cades> oh
<Saturn> 08,01NullRadix: i love that one!

<J_E_Smith71> Canadian_Brony: Yeah we just had her intro
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: lawl she isnt
<Phase4> that is exactly what construction looks like
<DeadPoolDash> shinji had to use one of asuka's at one point

<pony_6119> that bear, is high as fuck
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: so... the NGE pic and her intro AND stuff she has on her playlists isn't proof she is?
<DeathStar> flutterchu: it's the bear that wassn't
<kirz|art> otakon, what you fail to realize, is that Shinji already uses a female plugsuit, because he is the biggest pussy in the series
<Canadian_Brony> otakon no, Saxy's playing tricks. J_E_Smith71 we did? I didn't see it.
<pandabear> flutterchu: this is sparta?
<otakon> kirz|art: but he eventually gets a regular suit, not one with boob plates
<RoboGerbil> so much smoking
<Phase4> and then everyone was smoking
<J_E_Smith71> Canadian_Brony: Unless Saxy's playing tricks and using Asuka pics and her intro to screw with us
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: since when does shizuka use youtube. also the pic is just a lie
<DeathStar> even the bear
<Swaffy> Yeah, I'm getting off to shower up and get to bed. And catch this cockroach. Ugh.
<pandabear> kirz|art: can I ask you something?
<kirz|art> that's because he's a pussy, not a boob :p
<HoodyNinja> And then talking bears
<Stallion_of_War> Smoking in a kid's cartoon; this is old.

<Shizuka> 13he reportedly hated it, because the bear gets a cigarette and coffee cup early on and keeps it through the short, apparently that somehow ruins the message that you should stay true to yourself
<HoodyNinja> Canadian_Brony: Intimated?
<Shizuka> 13and now you know
<Buytoast> that the show with the robot chick with the teal hair?
<otakon> Shizuka: he gets rid of it though but yh

<Shizuka> 13and yes this is the drawing room scene

<likeaboss> i have no idea wat they said
<Tovler> stick your tongue out at the iceberg
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: yeah thats true.
<likeaboss> damn jews
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk, can't see shit in the middle of the ocean in a moonless night with still waters. And it was spring so all the bergs weren't fully melted at the time.
<oni_link> lol whoa
<TheOtherOne> all the jokes in the movie keep sinking
<Kinixys> LOL
<Polydunami> All the secrets of this movie are behind the picture.

<oni_link> lol
<Shizuka> 13also mike has tweeted he isn't a fan of ponies himself but he respects that there's a fandom for it
<Sumica> 00,10but if I wanted to see chat and the movie I would just look to the right
<likeaboss> stip search
<HoodyNinja> Who pinged me? I'm not leaving?
<Shizuka> 13after all mst3k wouldn't have escaped the twin cities if not for epic fandom
<Shizuka> 13ohai sumi~
<Mega_Milk> MadSurge: Or he was on the crapper -lol
<Sumica> 00,10psssssst, Shizuka, you movie is not centered
<MadSurge> Shizuka: and that's a great way to respect the fandom without being part of it.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If this was a Japanese anime, there would be a person on the life vessel explaining why the ship was like that.

<smelt> indeed
<Shizuka> 13here we go
<Mega_Milk> NewSuperBronyU: For 3 episodes.
<Shizuka> 13BOIOIOIOIOIOING

<Phase4> Saturn, o_O
<HoodyNinja> HOLY GOD
<HoodyNinja> Mods are out
<Gentelmen-geeky> AdamTheDuck: am i a bad person for laghing at this move but crying at the end of godzilla vs destroyer when godzilla died
<Tovler> If only that ship was nuclear powered :'(
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: -olololol
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02'Could've gone with the HTC One X while I had the chance...'
<Sumica> 00,10it's like slapstick
<ASoftFluffyThing> Poor woman. Imagine witnessing something like that and your only child is on that ship.
<AdamTheDuck> Gentelmen-geeky, no, I feel the same way XD
<MadSurge> Sumica: pony comedic sociopathy :D
<Phase4> this isnt a bad bit of effect here
<oni_link> NewSuperBronyU: what did you go with instead?

<DeadpoolDash|ME3> here we go again
<pony_61191> they should make this into an amusment ride, and no. not the blow up one you see at the state fair
<Shizuka> 13did you ever see that roller coaster video where a rather large woman is slipping out of the seat and getting stuck in the seatbelts? that's it
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The ending to this movie really left huge plot holes, they really should make a sequel...wait a minute...
<Mega_Milk> ^ XD
<Sumica> 00,10yup
<oni_link> NewSuperBronyU wow XD
<smelt> eeyup
*ASoftFluffyThing has never seen Titanic 2

<twilight_sprinkle> +200
<Phase4> ^
<Rosfox> XD
<Panda-> NewSuperBronyU, >.> i like plot holes and plot twists >:3
<APPLEBLOOM111> MY LEG
<Sumica> 00,10would have been funny as hell if it just stuck like that
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> I want a Titanic movie told from the perspective of the Iceberg.
<oni_link> Phase4: I was not unfortunately
<twilight_sprinkle> +400
*ASoftFluffyThing inserts pingball noises
<Gentelmen-geeky> watched here die
<Sumica> 00,10and yes the plachinko line came to me
<MadSurge> BOING
<pony_61191> best quote from that movie "WHERES THE TAPE!?!?!?!?"
<Phase4> oni_link, not unfortunately, you are one of the lucky ones
<Sumica> 00,10well before mst3k
<Tovler> All those poor souls will never experience the joys of Spanish Influenza
<oni_link> Phase4: I feel better knowing that .
<MadSurge> Tovler: Ikr
<oni_link> hahaha
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02When's the part where the ship sinks?
<DeathStar> my favorite movie quote is "some days you just can't get rid of a bomb"
<Sumica> 00,10is he screwing her?
<MadSurge> NewSuperBronyU: I think it's coming... MAYBE
<ASoftFluffyThing> That rudder....is so tiny
<Sumica> 00,10cause she keeps going oh god oh god again
<Gentelmen-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: ello
<Phase4> ASoftFluffyThing, indeed
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai Gentelmen-geeky
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN
<Mega_Milk> Sumica: :D
<APPLEBLOOM111> odd time to have sex
<Phase4> mythbusters tested the sucking thing
<NocturnalBlade> ASoftFluffyThing: dont make fun of the boats small rudder, its rude lol
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: she forgot to bite the pillow :S
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> It was funny when Mythbusters busted the reason why Jack had to die.
<Phase4> turns out it doesnt happen
<Tovler> Arsenal: 1 Liverpool: 0
<Gentelmen-geeky> care for a spot of tea twilight_sprinkle
<ASoftFluffyThing> I never saw the Mythbusters episode of this.
<Sumica> 00,10am I the only one that say the reviset of that one Phase4?
<twilight_sprinkle> Gentelmen-geeky: eh no thanks, im about to go to bed, tea will keep me up~
<Sumica> 00,10they found it plausable
<MadSurge> Aaaaand it finally sank!
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> The director was pissed
<ASoftFluffyThing> DeadpoolDash|ME3, why'd Jack have to die.
<Gentelmen-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: ah
<DeathStar> Panda: you so derpy
<ASoftFluffyThing> That's a huge swimming pool
<twilight_sprinkle> Gentelmen-geeky: imma afk for a bit
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02CALL THE SEA PONIEZ
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> they said jack had to die cause the wood wouldnt support both of them
<Gentelmen-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: ok
<Panda> DeathStar >.> I have no idea why...
<smelt> and you know? if they just hadnt fueled the ship so much,it wouldnt have hit the ice berg
<Phase4> Sumica, iirc the plausable one involved a high density of bubbles, which doesnt apply that much to this
<oni_link> In icy water like that, would peeing actually make a difference?
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> but that isnt the case
<Gentelmen-geeky> DeathStar: hello
<Tovler> If someone had yelled Adult Swim, they would know to get out of the water.
<Phase4> oni_link, no
<DeathStar> Gentelmen-geeky: hello
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> so jack died needlessly
<Panda> DeathStar I figured out why I am lagging D:
<oni_link> Ah I see.
<Gentelmen-geeky> how are you mis DeathStar
<Tovler> Just keep swimming
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Keep doing that thing that you've been doing since you first got in the water!
<Panda> call upon the C ponies, when ur in distress!
<DeathStar> DeadpoolDash|ME3: there's also the fact that she could have moved over...
*Panda signals the SOS
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> thats the point
<Sumica> 00,10I saw a pony version of this, blue blood was standing on the door looking down at ratity.
<Saturn> 08,01DeathStar! I'm howling at the moon! And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon!
<DeathStar> Panda: helpfull as can be ponies simply send as S.O.S
<Gentelmen-geeky> you know two pepol can fit on that door
<smelt> or if they hit the iceberg dead on with the front of the god damn ship,it would have only hit the first few things and they would have stayed afloat
<Panda> XD Saturn
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> there was plenty of room for both and wood could of held their mass
<MadSurge> DeathStar: nope, we must have a dramatic xcene.
<DeathStar> Saturn: I'm not discord I'm a space station!
<Phase4> plenty bouyent enough for two but dificult to balance, therefore we give up and let jack drown
<ASoftFluffyThing> smelt, and if Captain had taken heed to the obvious iceberg warnings that he was getting since DAY ONE.
<Phase4> i'm k with that
<Panda> DeathStar so TAKE YOUR TYRANY AWAY~!!!!
<smelt> exactly
<DeathStar> Panda: >.>
<Mega_Milk> I know at this point his nads have retracted back into him.
<Mega_Milk> making him a woman.
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> the director got angry and said Jack had to die cause it was in script
<Panda> Saturn, dammit, now its stuck in my head
<Phase4> When does the narhwall bacon
<Gentelmen-geeky> DeathStar: the sos was not ivented yet thay you uesd a defrent
<Panda> and DeathStar >.> what?
<smelt> the people on that boat should have thrown the captain off the ship
<Tovler> The HMS Romney intercepted the distress signal but went meh.
<Panda> Phase4 at midnight?
<DeathStar> Gentelmen-geeky: ... I think the SOS would have been invented...
<ASoftFluffyThing> Tovler, oh god lol
<Gentelmen-geeky> DeathStar: thay didnt ues it back then thay had a mor complceted one
<NocturnalBlade> lol
<Sumica> 00,10swim back fatty, you can probably hold 10 yourself
<Gentelmen-geeky> Sumica: lol
<DeathStar> Gentelmen-geeky: ah I see. well I'm sure the sea ponies of the time would have known about it
<oni_link> Sumica: she holds blubber, she was made for that XD
<Mega_Milk> Sumica: -lol or atleast give a shark some serious artery clogging.
<DeathStar> Sumica: fat dose float.....
<Gentelmen-geeky> DeathStar: mor than likely
<Saturn> 08,01Panda: mission accomplished
<ASoftFluffyThing> The seaponies were responding. They're calld hungry sharks.

<Kencolt> Ryunosuke: In the US? yes, it IS. Making distilled liquor- or nearly any kind-- is illegal unless you pay the tax. And the definition of moonshine is untaxed, unaged whiskey.
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<Vivix> I don't know why its illegal in Norway, probably same reason Kencolt
<Vivix> Unlicenced production, and health codes
<Moopy> Hey sumica "T.N.T!"
<Kencolt> Vivix: Would make sense. Like it or not, the gummint needs taxes to run.
<Vivix> yeah
*Vivix happily pays taxes
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: hey ill leave u alone then but just one thing ive been wondering for ages is your name yr real one adam
<Kencolt> Vivix: And yeah-- no quality control.
<Vivix> and especially, food and alcohol needs to be regulated for the safety of the customers
<Vivix> There was a wave of Methanol moonshine in Norway
<Vivix> people died, and people went blind
<SirGanjalf> Vivix: Same thing in Czech Republic not so long ago.
<Kencolt> Vivix: Methanol? OH--- KAAAAYY. That's downright toxic.
<Vivix> Yeaah, they used it to eh thin it out, to make more money
<Vivix> reaalllyy unsafe and bad practice
<Spectrum_Rush> IM IN A PLASTIC TUBE OF EMOTION
<SirGanjalf> methanol =/= ethanol. Remmber kids - one letter might be a difference between life and death
<Vivix> Yep~
<Sumica> 00,10well that was expected
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, that my dear, is a story for a rainy day.
<Sumica> 00,10two men walk in to a bar one says give me h2o, the othere says give me h2o too.
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: oki loki doki
<Kencolt> WHOA.
<Sumica> 00,10the second guy died
<Vivix> ohoho sumica, u nerd
<SirGanjalf> Sumica: :D
<Kencolt> Balloon Animals Save Lives?
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: dam it wrong order
<Vivix> In our chemistry book they had an example on how people can be fooled into thinking things
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: didnt you make that joke already
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Vivix> they had a warning leaflet, with the full name of H2O (which I can't remember) and all the things, inhaling is deadly, and all the warnings
<Vivix> and said "Please help us band it today!"
<Vivix> ban*
<Vivix> Brilliant demonstration on how people can make uneducated decisions based on propoganda-
<Sumica> 00,10ah the penn and teller thing yeah Vivix?
<SirGanjalf> Vivix: I think Penn&Teller did that
<Vivix> Not sure, it was in our school books
<Vivix> Printed..1998 I guess, r94 school reform
<Sumica> 00,10brb, feeling snackie
<Vivix> Mm~
<Vivix> What,..was that an ad for?
<Gold_Demona> brb, getting breakfast.
<Vivix> "MAAANLY CAR"
<Kencolt> Twizzlers. A red licorice-like candy with a faint strawberry falavor. HORRIBLE stuff to my mind, Vivix .
<Phase4> lol
<Phase4> these ads
<Vivix> Hehe
<sa_Spog> haha
<Ryunosuke> gotta love fosters ads
<Vivix> But the one before it, the ups store? I thought they only did shipping-
<TheRandomkid321> I'm australian and never heard of taht beer.
<sa_Spog> really?
<TheRandomkid321> sa_Sog yes.
<therainbowvortex> hey every pony if celestia is pony god then who is pony devil
<RoboGerbil> free data tracking
<TheRandomkid321> Discord
<Vivix> that actor
<Kencolt> therainbowvortex: Discord, and the Nightmare.
<Vivix> and various other 'villains'
<Vivix> Discord and Nightmare--hey yeah those are probably the best example-
<TheRandomkid321> Well if you ask me. If there was a pony satan it would be discord
<Kencolt> But I see Celestia (and Luna) not so much as "gods" avatars of deity.
<SirGanjalf> What if Celestia is both god and the devil? *conspiracy keanu face*
<Ryunosuke> welcome to american TV
<Vivix> yeah Demi-gods or deities
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah been having all thses fancy partys at work with like tons of meat and cheese platters
<Ryunosuke> 30 minute show... with 15 minutes of ads
<Ryunosuke> :p
<XylemTube> lololol internet dating
<Sumica> 00,10like 300bucks a platter
<Vivix> bigfood <,<
<TheRandomkid321> YES! YEEEES!
<SirGanjalf> beegfoot
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> that is way you change channels during commercials
<Sumica> 00,10so yeah I been liberating the leftovers
<therainbowvortex> Kencolt: i kinda agree when i think about it nightmear is the closet to a fallen angle
<RoboGerbil> heh ever read the fine print on those international dating sites?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Heh, internet dating
<SirGanjalf> "OMG what is that?
<SirGanjalf> "
<Ryunosuke> god they are STILL going on about Bigfoot?
<Vivix> Nightmare could probably be a danger to all ascended alicorns-
<Sumica> 00,10Sumi want big boom
<RoboGerbil> if you want to meed them you gotta pay like $6k
<TheRandomkid321> RoboGerbil Eeeyup
<Spell-of-Gaming> I used to mock people who online date when I was young
<SirGanjalf> they need to go deeper
<SirGanjalf> *rimshot*
<RoboGerbil> trenches in ww1 were deeper
<Spell-of-Gaming> Particularly ROBLOX, which is now full of crap.
<Sumica> 00,10I love how you can see the shock charge
<Vivix> I thouht WW1 trenches were so shallow you had to crouch?
<Vivix> in the frontlines
<SirGanjalf> not really
<SirGanjalf> i think you could stand shot from there
<Vivix> The only trench I remember is from Pink Floyd's The Wall
<Kencolt> Vivix: No. In fact, some were as deep as eight feet, and had cruse steps built for the next (usually futile) chrage.
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<Ryunosuke> duh?
<Kencolt> Charge.
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> The Great War had pretty complex trench systems
<Vivix> Aah, makes sense- they were there for a really long time
<Ryunosuke> because the trench contained the blast and it had no where to go :p
<SirGanjalf> WWI was all about trenches
<Sumica> 00,10and then the tank
<Vivix> WW1 Games, I want one
<TheRandomkid321> Spell-of-Gaming yeah. I miss the old roblox. Back when a game with no moe than a bunch of zombies and a few buildings was really popular. Now the maker has said, and I quote "We believ Roblox will be the prime engine for independant game makers to use from now on" Or something along those lines.
<Ryunosuke> inb4 clown car jokes :)
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> tanks and machine guns were the biggest factors in the Great War
<Vivix> Maxim, yeah
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> and the introduction of airplanes
<Vivix> or the name
<XAX> Guys, was the SCP website made before or after around 2007?
<Spell-of-Gaming> ROBLOX used to be popular until it became a toilet full of outdated memes
<Vivix> I didn't think tanks were succesful in ww1 though-
<Spell-of-Gaming> Actually, I mean good
<Sumica> 00,10inbefor wiplash death
<Gold_Demona> I'd think that bounce would make the impact worse.
<TheRandomkid321> Spell-of-Gaming for me it was the new games and people. But there are outdated memes all over it... And so much copyrighted material. EXPECIALLY MINECRAFT!
<Sumica> 00,10it's not the bound, it's the rebound
<Spell-of-Gaming> I found Roblox in Newgrounds :3
<Gold_Demona> right
<TheRandomkid321> Spell-of-Gaing what year?
<Vivix> I hate blowing balooons--
<MadSurge> Sumica: ask Spiderman's second love interest

<Spell-of-Gaming> ...That's fun.
<Vivix> Another break!?
<Sumica> 00,10I miss when they used to do like 6 myths an ep

<therainbowvortex> who thinks celestia is totaly bad ass
<Sumica> 00,10we interrup your ads to bring you mythbusters
<trollhunter> hey yall
<Vivix> I'm a masssiive Celestia fan
<Sumica> 00,10NLR
<Spectrum_Rush> I prefer Luna, Celestia ok though
<Vivix> I adore them both
<Sumica> 00,10need more candace art though
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Vivix> Yeah, Cadence is cool. I didn't expect her to be, but--she really turned out nice
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica Soon™
<Vivix> I can't for the life of me abide by the official spelling though, since her real name is Cadenza, Cadance just don't make sense, pronunciation or otherwise-
<Sumica> 00,10I do hope we see more of them
<Vivix> me too-
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sumerpan™
<XAX> Vivix: Nickname.
<Spectrum_Rush> Bamtan™
<Vivix> Yeah, but it just sounds wrong, I can't pronounce it correctly when it's written like that
<Vivix> it becaomse Kay Dance
<Gold_Demona> Cadance and Cadenza are technically the same thing
<Sumica> 00,10can dance
<Spell-of-Gaming> Midersan™
<Vivix> yeah, I can't stand it-
<TheRandomkid321> NLR or SE hmm? Well the way I see it (and the way my fanfic i'm writing says it) the NLR is like a rebellion and the SE is a dictatorship.
<Vivix> so Iw rite Cadence
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: only different languages
<shmoopy> Hey whos using my username thats Moopy? can you at least just knock it off
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Exactly
<Gold_Demona> Mi Amore Cadenza means "My Love Cadance"
<Vivix> I support neither NLR or SE, but there's probably a good fic along those lines ou there I can read
<TheRandomkid321> THAT MOOPY IS A SPAI!
<Vivix> but is Cadance the right spelling as a word?
<shmoopy> Im not a spy
<XAX> Vivix: I pronounce it "kaydense"
<Spell-of-Gaming> Midersan™ is very arigatoful
<Vivix> I say Kaydense too, hence Cadence with an e-
<Spectrum_Rush> Vivix: Untied Equestria
<Sumica> 00,10pass word your nick and use nick enforce if you dont want that happening
<TheRandomkid321> There's noone named Moopy on the list.
*Spectrum_Rush can't grammar
<MadSurge> I do call her "Mi amore Cadenza" sometimes just for the giggles :D
<Vivix> Cadance is not a word in English, Cadence is though
<shmoopy> well it said Moopy is already in use thats what it said on my screen
<Gold_Demona> Well, the WORD is spelled "Cadence"
<TheRandomkid321> try changing it
<Gold_Demona> The name is spelled Cadance
<Vivix> I just think the pronunciation changes too much with the a
<therainbowvortex> Sumica: how do you do that
<Vivix> I sometimes do find all replace in Cadence fics-
<Spell-of-Gaming> Who cares about spelling
<Vivix> I do <3
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, NLR or SE? I say neither, go for the winning P.A.R.T.Y. http://fav.me/d417vyv
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's too mainstream
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I honestly don't hear a difference. "Cadance" is pronounced "kay dense" to me. =/
<Vivix> Maybe it's my foreign ears-
<MadSurge> Can't wait what mispellings Season 3 will bring :D
<Sumica> 00,10good question therainbowvortex, I would recomend asking in #help
<Spell-of-Gaming> Can we discuss on how we pronounce "Giygas" now?
<Sumica> 00,10cause I forgot
<Vivix> If I ever wrote Cadence stuff, I would probably abide by standard spelling because- standards are standards, but- I'd personally say cadence
<therainbowvortex> Sumica: lol
<Sumica> 00,10I only needed to do it once
<shmoopy> So how do i use nick again?
<Vivix> slash nick
<Spectrum_Rush> /nick
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, type /ns help
<Spell-of-Gaming> YODIO
<shmoopy> Ok hang on a minute'
<Spell-of-Gaming> You only do it once
<TheRandomkid321> thanks for filling my chat AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, :P
<Gold_Demona> Well, if you get technical, we Americans pronounce it "kayd Nns". No vowel sounds between the d and the n. XD
<shmoopy> Wait do i say nick when changing it back or?
<TheRandomkid321> type EACTLY /nick Moopy
<therainbowvortex> shmoopy: go .nick moopy
<therainbowvortex> d
<Vivix> Isn't there a muted vowel to smooth the transition? I usually hear Kaydens
<Vivix> dns having a muted e
<Kencolt> Plausible, but not yet confirmed.
<Spectrum_Rush> ce, cad(a)-nce\ as a girl’s name is a variant of Cadence (Latin), and the meaning of Cadance is “with rhythm”.Read more at http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Cadance#6RC62DFGmwdWxEpM.99
<Spell-of-Gaming> ARE WE TALKING ABOUT DNS ADDRESSES NOW
<MadSurge> :O Portal 2!
<Vivix> No exact results found for Cadance in the dictionaries.
<Vivix> Cadenza is an italian word, where the translation is Cadence
<Spell-of-Gaming> Probably be
<MadSurge> Vivix: yep
<Spell-of-Gaming> Cadence is a musical term, IIRC
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Cadance isn't a word. It's a name based on the word "cadence"
<Spectrum_Rush> the the spelling really matter?, its prenouced Kay dense so thats all ya gots to remember
<TheRandomkid321> Great Costume *snicker*
<Vivix> Yeah
<Phase4> XD
<Vivix> Cadence is a rythmical thing
<Gold_Demona> Yeah

<CrimsonPhoenix> seeing the trailer more makes me want to see it less
<Spectrum_Rush> not yet
<TheRandomkid321> Well... Almost
<Spectrum_Rush> Soon™
<Vivix> Faust?--eh, oh well
<CrimsonPhoenix> OPPAN SHINNING STYLE
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> shininh
<MLP> Hey :D
<Phase4> they've got a lot of feedback from this and have aparently improved the animation
<Vivix> It looks good, but I don't like the song- REALLY good job though
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> shining
<MadSurge> SO HORRIFYING
<Spectrum_Rush> http://i.imgur.com/Su1Cb.png
<MadSurge> PLAY ALL THE PONYGROOVES
<MadSurge> BOOO *throws rotten tomatoes*
<Sumica> 00,10two lyra's
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> lol
<Vivix> BonBon's face
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> clones!
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> changelings
<TheRandomkid321> Dat eating animation
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't like this video for 2 reasons
<CrimsonPhoenix> tombstone's voice and those creepy looking forward eyes.
<Spectrum_Rush> trixie and repetitive beat?
<TheRandomkid321> PONY DOWN! I REPEAT! GREY PONY DOWN!
<Vivix> I only caught teh end of the audio
<Vivix> oj neeej fan heller
<CrimsonPhoenix> AND NOW WE GO BACK IN TIME
<Vivix> creepy broken pony knees and odd faces
<CrimsonPhoenix> Eeeeeeeeew Engliiiiiiiish
<TheRandomkid321> CrimsonPhoenix That's offensive to tombstone.
<Vivix> Its not, really
<Spectrum_Rush> no it not
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheRandomkid321, I'm sorry but I cannot stand his voice when it comes to singing
<Vivix> when I sing people can openly dislike my voice, its just how taste works
<MadSurge> For the record, I don't mind Trixie being hammy or an arrogant stage magician, it's her braggart/jerk attitude that makes me go mad
<Vivix> I like her attitude, but in real life, I'd shun her-
<TheRandomkid321> CrimsonPhoenix is it his accent? I persoaly love his singing
<CrimsonPhoenix> I mean he's a cool guy and all but
<Spectrum_Rush> opinions opinions opinions
<Vivix> I only caught the end, but it sounded really - unenergetic then
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't think even his accent is the whole fault
<Gold_Demona> It is possible to appreciate someone's talent without actually liking the sound they make.
*TheRandomkid321 eyes look at stream for a sec
<Vivix> That it is
<TheRandomkid321> OH GOD KILL THEM WITH FIRE!
<Gold_Demona> It's a matter of taste
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Hating on CaramellDansem
<TheRandomkid321> No I mean the ponys. They look distorted
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh shit you just didn't GO there
<Gold_Demona> I'm the same way with voice actor Sonny Strait. The man's a good voice actor, but I don't like the sound of his voice.
<MadSurge> Fluttershy would never agree to do a caramelldansen vid, she's too shy :D
<Vivix> There's a lot of that in music
<TheRandomkid321> What's this song?
<Vivix> not everyone can like everything, its just not possible
<MadSurge> U^
<Gold_Demona> If everyone liked everything, there'd be a lot less hate. =/
<Vivix> There would- but there'd probably be less fun on the outskirts of music
<TheRandomkid321> AUSTRALIA YEAH!
<Spectrum_Rush> if you liked everything then that means you'd have to like all the bad too
<MadSurge> Is this from that Horrible guy's singing blog?
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, indeed
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, but the worldn't wouldn't be as interesting if there wasn't any conflict :3
<Vivix> I mean, I respect and appreciate artists I don't like, and that's enough I guess
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: This is true
<TheRandomkid321> What is this song I must KNOW!
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: This is also true
<Vivix> unless they're really mean to me or peopel around them, but then noones thinking rationally
<MadSurge> PONY CANTINA :D
<Gold_Demona> Dat cantina music. XD
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, oops I mean world wouldn't*
<CrimsonPhoenix> Like example
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: I knew what you meant. :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Gold_Demona: but then the world would just be wrong
<Kencolt> MadSurge: There's a Vocaloid vid out there, with the Mane six doing a song and dancing. Well, five are. Fluttershy is huddled up in a corner. (Warning, humanised-- Vocaloid can't handle full ponies yet.)
<CrimsonPhoenix> I cannot stand Dubstep and I think it's a step in the wrong way in the music industry
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> But that is just an opinion.
<AdamTheDuck> We all have our views.
<Gold_Demona> Derp!
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God hahaha xD
<Gold_Demona> Derprolled
<CrimsonPhoenix> >derprolled
<Vivix> Yeah, I like some step, but I mainly prefer non-electronic music
<DeadpoolDash|ME3> wow, vlc can play vids as your wallpaper
<MadSurge> Kencolt: so fitting :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> and now I hate you
<pony_2761> Never Gonna Givr You Up
<XylemTube> HNNNNNNGGGGG
<CrimsonPhoenix> Never gonna derp you up sounds better than....urgh Derprolled....
<adasdad> ... this sync perfectly with EQDs rarity gif. lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> YES
<CrimsonPhoenix> PONY POLKAAAAAAAA
*Gold_Demona has this as a screensaver
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guess what's mine

<Vivix> Horses are fun-
<Vivix> Too scared to ride one though
<Vivix> is this Kyoga?
<Vivix> sounds like him-
<Kencolt> Spectrum_Rush: I mean it's an actual real world gait, apparently. I read it somewhere, had a video-- I forget where, tho, or what it was called.
<Spectrum_Rush> ah
<Gold_Demona> Super Scoots!

<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, ehh, he likes to play Minecraft for the building, so be it.
<AdamTheDuck> I actually wouldn't mind to be honest
<Phase4> TheRandomkid321, can still kill you though
<therainbowvortex> TheRandomkid321: what deny the loving damage of the creeoer mother
<Phase4> one got me a while ago
<Gold_Demona> I personally wouldn't want to spend hours building something just to have a creeper up and wreck it. =/
<Phase4> but my door is still intact
<Sumica> 00,10it's bad enough his place is gonna blow up when the engiens overheat
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck yeah. I'm one of the people who play it for the constant thrill and sense of adventure.
<therainbowvortex> TheRandomkid321: me too that and the crepers
<Gold_Demona> I've never played Minecraft, but I'd probably play it for the building and not much else.
<Vivix> Yeah, that's why I played it
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona That's part of the fun!
<Gold_Demona> I like making things
<AdamTheDuck> NewSuperBronyU, go to bread. :P

<AdamTheDuck> Well therainbowvortex, I've actually already told why I have the duck part of my name before :P
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, but they're normally smaller than me and less numerous
<Gold_Demona> dat Friday Polka
<AdamTheDuck> Adam was just named after an anime I was watching at the time, Neon Genesis Evangelion
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: u have 6_9
<AdamTheDuck> oh they were good times
<Phase4> my plan was to use obsidian pipe to pick up dropped ore
<Phase4> for when the macerator is full
<Lil_B> ok, and I have to go again xD don't know how long this will take
<Phase4> but that broke
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Wait... So you named yourself Adam after the first Angel?
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, eeyup :P
<Gold_Demona> That's awesome. XD
<Gold_Demona> I already know the duck part. :3
<AdamTheDuck> So yeah, my real name isn't Adam. :P
<Gold_Demona> Nice mashup
<therainbowvortex> so wait what is your first name
<AdamTheDuck> It is a mystery 6_9
<therainbowvortex> lol
<AdamTheDuck> You could probably find it if you manage to find my Skype :P
<AdamTheDuck> But I liked being refered to as Adam
<therainbowvortex> whats your skype name
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh... Damnit I keep it on autologin...
<AdamTheDuck> And I don't have Skype on my laptop
<AdamTheDuck> I might as well retell my "duck" part of the story again to you therainbowvortex :P
<therainbowvortex> okay
<AdamTheDuck> Back in the day, back in 'Nam
<AdamTheDuck> We were outnumbered 4 to 1

<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: lol so much lol
<Gold_Demona> My cat is reminding me that he's "starving" brb. :P
<AdamTheDuck> So my class had to watch a documentary at school, a documentary on the Arctic
<therainbowvortex> i gess u just like ducks?
<therainbowvortex> k
<AdamTheDuck> It was kind of boring but then the food chain part of the documentary played, and there was this duck
<AdamTheDuck> The best duck in the world because it couldn't hunt
<AdamTheDuck> it had to scavenge for food
<AdamTheDuck> and it started eating old seal flesh
<AdamTheDuck> and that was awwwwwwesome
<therainbowvortex> awwwwwsome
<AdamTheDuck> Meat eating duck is best duck
<AdamTheDuck> and so, the two parts of my name came together, Adam from Evangelion and a duck from an Arctic documentary about scavenging ducks that eat flesh/
<Gold_Demona> back

<MadSurge> Ah well, going to the pool too. See you later ponies :)

<Gold_Demona> Either I'm going to my mom's house to hand out candy or I'm just staying home and doing nothing.
<RaveBrony> Have fun, MadSurge!
<Barb|RoninPony> Did I miss something?
<Everlasting_Joy> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Scaring the crap out of the people who walk through the hallways here.
<Jmo> Ditching eggs at bypassers sounds fun.
<Dken2021> Barb|RoninPony because we don't normally wear clothes?
<Barb|RoninPony> Jmo ever been hit in the face with a diaper?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Everlasting_Joy: :D Shadowbolt Dash would be proud

<Barb|RoninPony> From a car?
<Jmo> From a penguin.
<Barb|RoninPony> Happened to me, no joke, in Las Vegas
<Jmo> Oi you broke the rule.
<Barb|RoninPony> Luckily it was in a bag.
<Jmo> What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
<Jmo> Honestly.
<Everlasting_Joy> Sketch_Toku_Brony: :).
<Barb|RoninPony> And also ends up in bronystate chat
<WallDives> and the internets.
<Dken2021> what a story
<Barb|RoninPony> Jmo by that logic four years of my life are just unaccounted for.
<Barb|RoninPony> Sumica does not exsist.
<Barb|RoninPony> XD
<Jmo> Keep it like that.
<RaveBrony> I encourage all of you to participate in the Nightmare Night Art Contest! :)
<Jmo> I shall send in my stick figure art.

<Everlasting_Joy> I don't have a scanner, I can't really do anything in terms of the contest at this point :(.
<Jmo> MS Paint Extreme?
<KnifeH> Yes
<Jmo> Hardcore.
<KnifeH> It just looks like SAI
<Everlasting_Joy> I'd love to, but I don't have the resources.
<Jmo> Lul
<KnifeH> I feel like I'm the only person that bought SAI legit XD.
<Jmo> Pfffft
<Dken2021> only fools who went to school buy their programs legittimately
<Jmo> I don't need no damn education.
<KnifeH> It was 50 bucks. For an awesome drawing software, it's worth it.
<KnifeH> (plus the crack was shit back then)
<Jmo> lolol

<Everlasting_Joy> Spectrum_Rush: Give Ms. Frizzle credit, her chamelion circut would be busted.
<Gold_Demona> Spectrum_Rush: That is awesome. XD
<Everlasting_Joy> *wouldn't
<Everlasting_Joy> I must take off, it's lunch time!
<Gold_Demona> And it wouldn't surprise me in the least if Ms. Frizzle was a time lord and the bus was her tardis.

<Gold_Demona> The Doctor is male
<Barb|RoninPony> She would be the Professor
<Gold_Demona> Or The Teacher
<Gold_Demona> Since she teaches... what is it, third graders? I forget
<Tervicz> If her name was Quinn she could be a doctor, no?
<Gold_Demona> Maybe she's "The Frizzle" XD
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Spectrum_Rush> The Doctor finally got to be ginger... he just didn't realize what it'd take :S
<Gold_Demona> But the Doctor can't regenerate into a female

<Barb|RoninPony> It has many aplications.
<Barb|RoninPony> It can start fires.
<Barb|RoninPony> It can also ward off bears

<Barb|RoninPony> Oh yeah.
<Barb|RoninPony> Cancer is a super power, right?
<Snow> uhm, your confusing it with gamma rays, acid is good for your cholesterol
<Meanwhile> Super cancer.
<Meanwhile> Worlds worst Avenger.
<MecidTheGermanBrony> Radiation + Acid = Cancer 2.0

<Snow> just drawit?
<TrixieMuffins> is youtube down for anyone else ?
<pony_4909> not for me.
<pony_064236> Hey, I got a question about cutie marks please. Are cutie marks reversed on each flank? Eg. I just got a rdash wallet and the cutie mark is reversed from what I normally see on her left flank, but this wallet shows her right flank. Is that a mistake on the wallet manufacturer, or is this actually accurate? http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=13341665
<Jmo> tl;dr
<pony_4909> that doesn't look right.
<Dken2021> pony_064236 I guess so...or you're looking into it too much, either way
<Meanwhile> Don't know, never paid that much attention to cutie mark placement.
<Jmo> ^
<Dken2021> also, sup pony_064236

<DaringDerpy> for science!
<Snow> at least you got things, ive been spending hours at trade servers trying to buy that nobody has!
<DaringDerpy> don't know what you were talking about though
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: I got one better, got the direct hit as a random drop during the rounds... and then got another one as the reward
<DaringDerpy> hm...videogames
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Too bad you can't dual wield them really. The crate I picked up between rounds dropped me a strange FAN, which is nice because I've been missing a strange scout weap for a while.

<Jmo> o.o
<Jmo> I promise we didn't talk.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> I think I'd know if you did. He doesn't keep secrets. XD

<Jmo> <.<
<Meanwhile> The magic of stuff.

<Snow> schools gonna throw big pills at me, just got 2 books for one class for this year, contained in total 1500+ pages
<Jmo> pills.
<SafariMonkey> Jmo: Tell that to the metres-long snakes and deadly scorpions I killed
<Snow> yeah, its a term for very big books
<Jmo> Pffft.
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: Hence my nick
<Gold_Demona> Thems big snakes
<Jmo> Come play with our spiders.
<Jmo> :>
<Snow> id rather not, i stay away from spiders now for at least a month
<Dken2021> I like how some books for classes cost alot and it's just a binder with paper you put in
<Gold_Demona> My attic is full of big ol' spiders that keep crawling into my kitchen through a whole right above the sink.
<Snow> or at least untill i got that fic out of my mind...
<Gold_Demona> I keep finding drowned spiders when I do dishes. >.>
<Dken2021> eww
<Jmo> I love spiders.
<Gold_Demona> I love them when they're outside. I don't want them in my house
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: My record is 5 metres and big enough that you could hold it with 2 hands without your hands touching. But then, no need to brag, most of you never got the chance.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/Cv9JU.png
<Jmo> Lawl
<Jmo> If only ashie-poo was here.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not sure if adorable or creepy
<Meanwhile> I'm sure his heart'd blow up.
<Jmo> Yep.
<RaveBrony> Dat pic
<Gold_Demona> Oh boy... We get some snakes here too, but they're nowhere near that big.
<Gold_Demona> Black racers that like to slip around my house and across my lawn
<Alchemist> Meanwhile dont do that
<Gold_Demona> My husband runs them over with the lawnmower. >:3
<Jmo> DOIT MEANWHILE DOIT
<Jmo> Wow Dema, Pete is cruel. ;_;
<Moopy> Hey is there a stream going on? cause i need to go refresh the stream here
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: He hates snakes more than I do
<Snow> Jmo: http://i.imgur.com/dNu3w.jpg
<Dken2021> aren't black racers harmless?
<Jmo> They're just snakes :<
<Dken2021> or am I thinking of something else
<Jmo> lol Snow.
<Gold_Demona> I believe so, but we have lots of different snakes here, so there's no way to be sure.
<Meanwhile> Snow: You saved that?
<Snow> eeeeyup
<Gold_Demona> Chances are it's a black racer, but it COULD be something else entirely
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Jmo> Poke it with a stick.
<Jmo> :>
<Gold_Demona> lol Jmo
<Snow> hit it with a whip
<Meanwhile> The scientific method right there, poke it with a stick.
<Snow> see if you can tame it
<Jmo> Whip it, whip it good.
<Gold_Demona> Whip it good?
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Jmo> Ninja'd
<Gold_Demona> Yup
<Kimori> Brad_ >.>
<Jmo> Meanwhile has the idea.
<alexxm> so is there a stream?
<Meanwhile> Don't think so.
<Jmo> The stream is a lie.
<SafariMonkey> Oh we got so many snakes in our house if we weren't careful, but we had tiles so they couldn't move
<SafariMonkey> :P
<Gold_Demona> What is this "stream" of which you speak? >.>
<Snow> you know what this chat needs
<Snow> MORE STREAMERS
<SafariMonkey> A defibrillator?
<Dken2021> I thought it needed more sand
<SafariMonkey> to prevent these fibrillations?
<Snow> i think he ment litterbox sand
<Meanwhile> This chat needs Steven_Magnet.
<SafariMonkey> (fibrillations are unsynchronised contractions)
<Snow> dont use your fancy words on me!
<Jmo> ^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> MORE SAND? We're surrounded by sand!
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/Px4Rv.png
<SafariMonkey> Snow: that's why I wrote that last bit
<Dken2021> hehehe
<Meanwhile> Too bad you don't work the same way Spectrum_Rush :P
<SafariMonkey> Though now I realise that may just have been more fancy words to some
<Spectrum_Rush> Yeah XD
<Jake> are we batteling with fancy words now?
<Snow> i got a mindblowing thought for you all
<Snow> what if we are all dreaming this life?

<Meanwhile> Got to fill your knifing quota of the day DWR?
<DashWithRainbows> Why of course.

<Gold_Demona> Pardon my ignorant American brain, but what's a chav?

<Jake> totally legit
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350920710746.png
<Snow> http://i.imgur.com/SpZIf.jpg
<Dken2021> Bronysith yea that seems about right
<Panda-> Snow, I have a horrible memory. Also, I havent really worked on it because my vectoring programs are messing up.
<Jake> but applejack is #6
<Alchemist> I look nothing like clint Eastwood.
<Vivix> Noone can resist the clint
<Snow> *resists*
<Snow> =P
<Panda> read that as "noone can resist the clit."
<Jake> ...
<WallDives> ^
<Snow> HEEEYO
<Vivix> Well-
<Vivix> few can resist the clit
<Jake> maybe hetero girls?
<Vivix> yeah- and gay guys
*Panda can resist the..... clit...
<Vivix> and people who think they look creepy
<Alchemist> Awesome chat guys :D
<Snow> or that other thing
<Jake> Who of you guys is homochromatic?
<Snow> im not gonna say it.
<Dken2021> ah, those poor gynophobiacs
<Jmo> Why is it you always make chat warped Vivix.
<Vivix> Not srue what that is
<Vivix> I can't help it JMO,
<Jmo> Honestly.
<Vivix> seriously I feel like typing in caps lock, my hands are shaky and my ears are ringing
<Jmo> Oh suck it up you wuss.
<Alchemist> Jake you mean monochromatic?
<Snow> ythen do it.
<Panda> Vivix, sounds like you have ponies on the brain.
<Jake> Alchemist same thing
<Vivix> Well, that, and I just finished rehearsing
<Snow> ysounds more like a luna in his head to me.
<Vivix> ;__;
<Jmo> That y.
<Jmo> I will murder its children.
<Jake> oh yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
<Vivix> Sometimes, if I play games for a really long time, that y will haunt me for hours
<Alchemist> Jake: not one person consists of one particular wavelenght's worth of color...
<Meanwhile> You know I like to scroll up to see what I miss when I divert my attention
<Snow> the children are the i and the J
<Meanwhile> But I'm starting to question doing that
<Jmo> Touche.
<Jake> Alchemist but it just means your eyes have the same color
<Meanwhile> Namely because I'm not sure I want to know the relevance of the sentence "No one can resist the clit."
<Ryunosuke> I heard that the clit is an offshoot of the Liberate Apes Before Imprisoning Apes movement, C/D? :)
<Snow> yi agree Meanwhile
*Panda shrugs
<Jmo> Fffff.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Wait, what the shit is this?
<Vivix> Ooh Ryunosuke, I c wat u did thar
<Jake> Bananas are greener then at night
<Ryunosuke> <3 Jay and Silent Bob :)
<Alchemist> Jake: Really? I didnt know that? I didnt know a person being mono/homochromatic had this meaning. Sorry.
<Jmo> He said sorry, must be canadian.
<Jake> you can also be heterochormatic Alchemist
<Blako> what is the difference between Stormy, Stormy_ and Stormy` ? :D
<Princess_Celestia> hi all
<Snow> Jmo: or just a nice guy.
<Jake> Hallo
<Jmo> Naaa
<Meanwhile> Jmo: Don't be silly. If he were Canadian he'd be fighting off a moose as we speak.
<Jmo> No such thing.
<Ryunosuke> hello, which Celstia is this? :)
<Jmo> You have a point.
<Snow> ypoint made there.
<Jake> y again
<Stormy`> Stormy is my netbook at home, Stormy` is my other laptop when my netbook is signed in, and Stormy_/Stormy__/etc are my phone
*ASoftFluffyThing doesn't even anymore
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> schizophrenia
<Vivix> Snoow, you been playing hours of Sourcegames?
<Meanwhile> Meese are a very big problem in Canada.
*Stormy` needs a better system
<Jmo> I bet.
<Stormy`> lol
<Snow> 24 hours to be exactly
<Vivix> Nice
<Meanwhile> The number of times windows have to be repaired because of ballistic moose assault is ungodly.
<Snow> for charity
<Vivix> Aah
<Princess_Celestia> the leader of canterlot Ryunosuke and twilght sparkes mentor
<Meanwhile> Well this should be funny for a few minutes.
<Jmo> Do a charity to get your y key removed.
<Snow> thats what the other 2045 celestias said too
<Blako> yup, it needs a better system
<Snow> just kidding.
<Jake> oh god ÿ
<Princess_Celestia> no other celestia here man once the name is in use it cant be used by others.......
<Jmo> >_>
<Stormy`> I'll probably just not idle on my phone since it drains my battery and annoys you all with join/quit messages anyway
<Jmo> Can I burn it with fire?
<Ryunosuke> well...
<Snow> yi said: just Kidding.
<Jmo> Pretty please?
<Meanwhile> Yeah.
<Ryunosuke> there is Lord_Celestia, Trollestia, molestia.. etc. etc. etc
<Meanwhile> Please do.
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Jmo> GTFO you Celestia wanna-be.
<Jmo> kthxpie

<Jmo> :>
<Princess_Celestia> somepony is in a bad mood
<Princess_Celestia> -points to Jmo
<Jmo> No, we just don't wanna see your rp rubbish.
<Jake> lemon lime pie f*ck ÿea
<Jmo> Take it to dashiesauce or some place.
<Vivix> There's rp rooms around here somewhere, but we aren't allowed to RP here
<Stormy`> then maybe I'll leave this computer at home instead of the netbook because it's falling apart -__
<Bronysith> Jmo: you mean the rejects?
<Jmo> Bingo.
<Domo> I think....I think I may have sound now guuys!
<Bronysith> oh dashiesauce, you never change

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> my sisters netbook is held together with duct tape.
<Snow> yO.O
<Jmo> ermagerd sound
<Snow> ygo test it Domo!
<Meanwhile> Claim to be Celestia. Then claim not to RP.

<Stormy`> even though it's a common defect
<Vivix> Noone yet, technically
<Jmo> Princess_Celestia, please go. You're making my brain cells commit suicide.
<Snow> *remembers school*
<Stormy`> I just took all the broken parts of the hinge out and taped the corner
<Snow> id had more then enough thank jou

<Applechip> I hear this song almost everywhere i go
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: you do know it is the best song of 2012 right?
<Domo> Now to test something else
<Vivix> I don't think it's the first time he or she is here, nor did he or she break any upon entering, don't up-play bullshit
<Dken2021> so...what's going on now?
<Stormy`> well mostly
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dken2021, stream apparently.

<Dken2021> did somebody mention Osu! ?
<Domo> Woo~! Its up!
<Invi> osu?
<Domo> Yep ouo
<Stormy`> I think it broke because the hinge is right by the vent, so the metal and plastic got warped by the hot air
<Jake> omigosh the stream finally started up
<Saturn> 08,01someone's showing Soul Eater?
<Dken2021> ah, see that you upgraded your streaming software Domo
<Invi> ui soul eater?

<Dken2021> Rhythm game
<Snow> resonance!
<Domo> And in the spirit of the month, lets have some Marilyn Manson
<Bronysith> Saturn: what about soul eater?
<Domo> and Soul Eater
<Stormy`> it sucks though... I spent 1/3 of my earnings from my summer job a couple years ago to buy this thing
*Saturn 08,01is listening to Jeff Bridged inside his earholes again
<Saturn> 08,01*Bridges
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> :(
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 this is halloween
<Meanwhile> Soul Eater, was that the bad anime you had up that one time?
<Saturn> 08,01it's funny because i'm also configuring ethernet bridges
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> warranty claims on anything sucks
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> the only thing that actually works is taking it back to the store
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but … not when youve had it for a few years
<Invi> Meanwhile, it's not that bad :3
<Applechip> Oh i love this remake
<Applechip> awww
<Jake> dat game
<Saturn> 08,01ha!
<Meanwhile> Invi: Is it the one with the school run by death?
<Saturn> 08,01i just had cause to name a virtual interface vif4.20
<Invi> Meanwhile, yeah
<Snow> boys and girls of every age, would you like to see something strange?
<Meanwhile> Invi: Hate it.
<Saturn> 08,01the mellowest virtual interface
<Stormy`> yeah. =/
*Saturn 08,01is mellow yellow
<Invi> Meanwhile, yeah, it is pretty silly
<Jake> dese game mechanics
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> my laptop has this thing
<Stormy`> the only other option besides taping it was to buy another case from HP for like $300
<Panda> fuck my internet
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> where if the same picture is on the screen for too long
<Invi> ew no
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you can see a ghost of it when you go do something else
<Stormy`> yeah HP, I'm totally giving you more money for making defective laptops
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its faint and you have to look for it to see it but its there
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> like a old plasma tv.
<Saturn> 08,01Panda|Drawing: is your internet hawt?
*Bronysith licks Saturn
<Stormy`> hm, weird
<Jake> ok ill go and do something productive
*Saturn 08,01explodes
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its a documentated issue though
<Meanwhile> I am the who when you call "who's there?" I am the wind blowing through your hair.
<Snow> dammit, thought i got a skype message
*Jake sneaks out of chat
<Jmo> lol productive
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and they wont do anything about it because they say its "within spec"
<Jmo> not possible.
*Dken2021 glomps Jake before he sneaks out
<Saturn> 08,01UNPOSSIBURY
<Kammerjunk> "productive" Ha.
*Saturn 08,01is doing it right
<Kammerjunk> That's rich.
*Jake falls and tumbels away
<Meanwhile> That's a lot of bananas.
<alexxm> oh shit this is imposible
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350919056326.png
<Saturn> 08,01not sure if overload pre-amp or just Daft Punk
<Saturn> 08,01or both
<Dken2021> you think this is impossible you should see the maps submitted by the community
<Vivix> all the overdrives
<Dken2021> and most of them have touchpads
<Jmo> Domo y u no have dual monitor ;_;
<Invi> hai MadSurge
<Kammerjunk> Dual monitor is best setup.
<ASoftFluffyThing> hi MadSurge
<MadSurge> I'm back! :$

*Bronysith glompels Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i just did something really fucking stupid

<Invi> Dken2021, and the one guy/girl no one knows the gender of ^^
<Saturn> 08,01i just bought a bluray of Tron Legacy
<Saturn> 08,01well, guess what?

<Invi> how can you forget you have no blue-ray player?
<Jmo> ^
<alexxm> is this game free?
<Dken2021> Saturn well that was sily of you
<ASoftFluffyThing> Not paying attention?
<Lil_B> today was a wasted day
<Meanwhile> So did you plan on buying a blu-ray player or did you just decide to get it so you can watch Tron?
<Saturn> 08,01Invi: because i have an HD tv and i play HD stuff i've downloaded on it all the time!
<Vivix> I'm gonna buy a guitar
<Vivix> brb
<Saturn> 08,01that... made more sense in my head

<Brad[Laptop]> Invi lol
<Bronysith> i need to browse /r/evangelion for asuka pics
*Invi pets Brad[Laptop] and gives him some popcorn ^^
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn, my internet is like a blonde. They can be hot as hell, and run very fast, but they are lacking in intelect...
<Sylandest> Panda|Drawing: ha!
<Meanwhile> I feel compelled to ask why the visage of a random lady keeps popping out the sides of the screen.
<Panda|Drawing> Meanwhile, your future wife.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Still not seeing any flashing colors
<Panda|Drawing> If anyone ever wants to marry you.
<Lil_B> ... my HD is making strange noises recently... I guess it's time to back everything up on the external now :/
<Invi> is this Audiosurf but with fruits?
<Jmo> Ooooooooh.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bronysith, calm down. Reddit will be up in its own time.
<Dken2021> maybe it's too fast for the stream to process?
<Meanwhile> Panda|Drawing: Can't be that then.
<Lil_B> and again, who is streasming?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im sure we would get at leasta solid color then
<Dken2021> Domo is
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350908577670.png
<Malmortius> So, streaming an MLP episode anytime soon?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It isnt like youtube where its compression rate is shit
<Jmo> lol did you really just ask that?
<MadSurge> Dken2021: OH, I vaguely heard of this! But I thought it was a Elite Beat Agents fangame?
<Malmortius> Sure why not.
<Saturn> 08,01wellp
<Bronysith> someone ping me?
<alexxm> who pinged me
<Domo> One sec, gotta plug something in for this one
<Meanwhile> You know Bronysith I'm sure if she cared she could find Asuka pics herself.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm voting Tron Legacy and Tron for A and B this week
<Spectrum_Rush> Domo was pinged
<Lil_B> Bronysith alexxm weas on stream I heard it too
*Bronysith buries Meanwhile alive with eggplants
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It bothers me when the reply typed into my chat window shows up before the reply typed in domo's window
<Chrysalis> so Saturn when did you start letting non-mods stream?
<Dken2021> MadSurge well it was what elite beat agents was based off of
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: I'm just saying.
*Bronysith puts eggplants in Meanwhile s tea
<Lil_B> ... something isn't right witzh my chat :/
<Malmortius> Whats the big deal about asking about streaming MLP.
<MadSurge> Who's Domo?
<ASoftFluffyThing> SpadeMagnes[School], why?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: im just filling your life with eggplants
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Because, it's kind of pathetic.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> ASoftFluffyThing: Makes me think I'm lagging\
*Bronysith pours more eggplants on Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Seriously, I'm trying to put this nicely.
<Dken2021> MadSurge she's a member of the bronystate art team
<ASoftFluffyThing> SpadeMagnes[School], I don't think it's lag.
<MadSurge> Dken2021: :O
<Domo> And if my tablet will go in--there we o!
<Domo> We can play more Osu! xD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Woah that chat delay....
<Vivix> Malmortius, they forcefeed us seaponies when we do ;__;
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: right, me trying to do something nicely for another person and you being your dickish self, now lets stop this before it gets extremely out of hand and we both end up getting banned
<MadSurge> Then hello Domo, nice to meet you! :$
<Malmortius> seaponies?
<Domo> Nice to meet you too MadSurge ^u^
<doctor_whooves127> you know a bunch of us should vote for the same thing to increase the odds of it getting picked
<Bronysith> What about the glorious sea ponies song?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Vivix, replace seaponies with Newborn Cuties.
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: That seems like a bit of an overreaction. I'm just saying she could do it herself and frankly she isn't likely to care about you regardless.
<Lil_B> is he Browsing via µTorrent?
<Vivix> What really?
<ASoftFluffyThing> We've come to love the seaponies to where there's an ocean, we wonder where seaponies are.
<Jmo> Domo Ping~
<Jmo> :>
<BladedWings|HW> ASoftFluffyThing: so true lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oi Jmo! I haven't gotten a hug from you in a few days.
<Dken2021> btw, some of these beatmaps are friggin hard to do with a mouse
<Jmo> O U
<DashWithRainbows> >Joomay

*Jmo hugs ASoftFluffyThing tightly

<Meanwhile> Ash is jelly.
<DashWithRainbows> Oh god, they exist
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Elite Beat Agents much?
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs Jmo back
<Jmo> You want a hug too?
<DashWithRainbows> Why would I be jelly of a hug?
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350895976914.jpg
<DashWithRainbows> I can always go to Gary's girth.
<MadSurge> Aaaah, now this looks more like Elite Beat Agents
<Jmo> Do it.
<Meanwhile> True.
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] actually elite beat was a localization

<Vivix> I don't think Saturn likes mac, if he likes open source
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yeah sometimes
<Kimori> yep
<Spell-of-Gaming> People used to punch you when you use XP back then
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have had vista for awhile, and not had any issues with it...why is vista so "bad"
<Vivix> Mainly inner things
<Vivix> like UAC
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: fair point to apple; the core of Os X is open source
<SpadeMagnes[School]> In english?
<Saturn> 08,01but yeah, I use Linux
<Jmo> how 2 engrish
<Vivix> Vista was HORRIBLE when it was brand new, but then is okay, but W7 is better
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but value is subjective.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Inb4 Apple outsources
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> it could be replacement value.
<Vivix> osx core is opensource? That's kinda neat-
<Lil_B> ... finally get a chance to get in touch with someone who buys Blindbags ou-mass, and now Euro Wave 5 is such a dissappointment -(\
