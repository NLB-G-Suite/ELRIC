<Vacation_Wrek> LilB: call in monopolizing
<Tassadork> midnight run was the only other stream, they had to cancel
<ThatGui> I don't think there is
<ThatGui> What for?
<CrimsonPhoenix> the anthology is better a bit after the mid point
<HyperMetalLugia> hi ripred
<Dark92Enigma> What is Pinkie Pie going to do WITH ALL THE GOLD?
<Tassadork> ThatGui: poor audio/video quality apparently, couldn't get their tech to work
<LilB> Vacation_Wrek thats bad... bacause the stream on everyfree isn't working... grrr...
<Dark92Enigma> TANK 4 PRESIDENT
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix perhaps that was their plan all along
<GabeMoist> still no bronycon?
<GabeMoist> what if Bronycon exploded?
<Tassadork> well, everfree is taping it I would assume, though their internets are teh suck
<Dark92Enigma> John Lennon + Applebloom........
<Ponies47> Vacation_Wrek: I see. I'm on vacation as well. I'm really bored. :/
<Tassadork> so delancie and the rest will make it to youtube

<AttackWithHugs> valoreins: Livestream+BronyState=Flash crash
<Dark92Enigma> Interesting
<AttackWithHugs> Secondary stream, right/
<Dark92Enigma> This is like one of the Nostalgia Critic's Commercial SPECIALS
<Tassadork> the primary stream on everfree is up. the BS stream here is a bit behind it
<valoreins> nah i stopped the bronystate stream
<alexxm> Tassadork any idea why
<Tassadork> it's two ... reporter people? talking about john delancie
<Chrysalis> the shiiiirt

<Lil> DUSTY!
<Lil> dat waxed head
<Dark92Enigma> RD said G1 is SO. AWESOME?..........OK.:)
<Tassadork> no idea why it would be so delayed. it's just a BS mod watching the same livestream and then streaming it to us yeah... ? it looked iike 3-4 minutes behind
<Shizuka> 13phase is in australia
<Shizuka> 13packets take a nonzero amount of time to travel that distance and back
<Marx> Well, coincidentally the stream comes back up again for the next panel.
<Tassadork> ah, that would do it
<diddutz> Shizuka: i don't think it's that cuz mips is about 15 minutes behind
<Ponies47> Ohai Shizuka :)
<Marx> Well, at least John De Lancie is next.
<Shizuka> 13because after all mips NEVER has problems..
<CrimsonPhoenix> all right I'm at 1:00:00 mark
<Dark92Enigma> Pinkie Pie went all Stewie.........''I DON'T LIKE CHANGE''

<CriticKitten> Still is mediocre.
<Dark92Enigma> THR TROTTING DEAD*

<Dark92Enigma> THE*
<AgentKalim> That's right, Dusty is so manly that the stream fixed itself for him. :P

<mishia> no lag 4 me :)
<Tassadork> days of our lives, no cheers. star trek, all the cheers.
<valoreins> no lag for me, thats unusual
<Lil_B> Chrysalis it normaly shows the buffering circle when its on my end, it just had a hick-up and showed 2 sec, but its freezing again
<AttackWithHugs> Dken2021: Why?
<AgentKalim> I'm not getting buffering, just lag. :P
<Tovler> I wonder what this anonymous show is?
<valoreins> delancie is going all BLARGHAHRGHA
<alexxm> Dken2021 any idea why and how do you know this
<Dken2021> AttackWithHugs he left it on and saud it's set to shut down after four hours
<AttackWithHugs> Dken2021: Ok
<Tovler> Little girls on motorbikes?
<alexxm> thanks Dken2021
<AttackWithHugs> Anyone else's stream blacking and coming back?
<Bronysith> damn it all
<Bronysith> i have to download it off origin
<pony_304> meh
<Tassadork> livestream loves me...
<Dken2021> and yet he did a documentary anyway
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, he's DOING like right now
<Kandarihu> Livestream loves me too.
<AgentKalim> Seriously, I don't want to bitch, but I'm getting lag every few seconds.
<AttackWithHugs> Tassadork: I sense sarcasm
<Irish_Pony> Storms outside ;_;
<Tassadork> no. the stream on everfree's website hasn't skipped once
<RainBowJack> well every pony i have to go to bed
<Dken2021> I guess some will have to watch via livestream
<RainBowJack> goodnight
<Dken2021> goodninght RainBowJack
<DaringDude> this is the one in NY right
<RaveBrony> Omg!! :D
<AttackWithHugs> Tassadork: It keeps skipping for me. It blacks and then it comes back with lag. I already cleared my cache and deleted all cookies so I don't know what it is.
<Tovler> take THAT MSNBC
<Dken2021> hmm, I wonder?
<diddutz> and everyone knows what hes talking about ^^
<dashierulez> lols
<dashierulez> clap clap clap
<Sasuke_Uchiha> 2Gtg..nice talking to you again :)
*Chrysalis applauds
<Tovler> NPR is indeed an embarassment
<valoreins> yeah i may not be an american but i know that "news" station
<Tassadork> AttackWithHugs: close and restart browser, to open some ram?
<AgentKalim> AttackWithHugs: Much of the same, except it doesn't even black out. It just freezes.
<CrimsonPhoenix> FOX44
<AttackWithHugs> AgentKalim: Hmm..I'm gonna try on Chrome because firefox is not agreeing with this
<alexxm> bye RainBowJack
<Alchemist> did anything interesting happen?
<AgentKalim> I don't even have Chrome, just Firefox
<CrouchingApples> Howdy
<diddutz> john is moderating his own panel ^^
<Alchemist> apart from the fire and the anthology 2? :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tara is Queen
<Dken2021> hopefully there's somewhat of a community after the show dies down a bit
<CrimsonPhoenix> John is King
<AttackWithHugs> I find that Chrome is more cooperative with some stuff than Firefox. Livestream is one of them.
<CrouchingApples> What're we watching?
<alexxm> Alchemist they're just setting the next panel up i think
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Lauren is god
<Chrysalis> he has SO much god damn power right now
<diddutz> CrouchingApples: BroNYcon
<CrouchingApples> Ah,
<CrouchingApples> Swell.
<diddutz> CrouchingApples: John de Lancie is up right now
<CrouchingApples> I want that pinkipie.
<CrouchingApples> Right now.
<Chrysalis> he just realised what he did
<Tassadork> shouldn't have said that. now he's got a fence
<Chrysalis> he now has SO many fences
<NullRadix> And then he had a fence
<Tassadork> probably many fences. all of them beautiful
<AttackWithHugs> What'd he do?
<NullRadix> with heart patterns
<CrouchingApples> Fences?
<Chrysalis> inb4 discord and fence pic
<AttackWithHugs> Dammit, Chrome!
<Chrysalis> AttackWithHugs when asked what did he want bronies to do, he joked fix his fence
<Chrysalis> then realised just WHAT he did
<Tassadork> inb4 delancie fence kickstarter
<AgentKalim> ^
<AttackWithHugs> lol
<Chrysalis> damnit Tassadork iu was just doing that
<Tassadork> =P
<Chrysalis> now i can't

<icybeauti> GilDash: Must be the case. ingwaz I'm american, but that's for the foreign bronies.
<Skydroid> I see Zedge on there
<brony_7878> are the people with an @ mods?
<RaveBrony> "They broke it" :D
<Skydroid> In SD storage
<ingwaz> icybeauti: and i'm confused
<icybeauti> brony_7878: Yes. You should make a name for yourself.
<icybeauti> ingwaz: What's your first language?
<Invi> Lil_B isn't TOR illegal?
<derpy_pony> Invi: http://www.y.walww.com/watch?v=Ay_1IZGxMaA not sure if it is the real thing
<CCCP> Why do some people watch the show find a favorite pony and then hate all the other charcters?
<diddutz> Invi: nope
<Lil_B> Invi well, watching a video blocked by GEMA would be illigal with every method
<Skydroid> I clicked on it
<dashierulez> all characters are awesome
<Skydroid> Ringtones
<Skydroid> See them
<brony_7878> i like all the characters :3
<icybeauti> Youtube is dced.
<ingwaz> icybeauti: english is the only language i claim to speak well enough to actually claim. so obviously english. i am american as well
<Skydroid> But no options to delete
<valoreins> CCCP: why would you think like that..?
<drf|laptop> 03hold-press
<drf|laptop> 03on the folder
<drf|laptop> 03and it should pop up a menu
<diddutz> Invi: you got a right to surf the web annonymously, so using to can't be illegal, but you should make sure to not be used as exit for others
<icybeauti> ingwaz: Ah. Heck, I think it's because we're staring at the stream at the same time as typing.
<derpy_pony> fuck gema
<CCCP> valoreins: because its true! i think many people have told me
<brony_7878> O_O theres a user named discord here
<Invi> derpy_pony it works :D how did you do that? ^^
<RaveBrony> Wakko <3 :D
<icybeauti> I hope the arroz con pollo is ready....And the churizos....
<ingwaz> icybeauti: entirely possible. i regularly have to do so much typing that i've learned to type blind without too horribly many mistakes
<derpy_pony> as I said. google ^^
<Lil_B> Invi using a Proxy isn't illegal, its just makes it harder to identifie your location, and thats not illigal XD
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<icybeauti> ingwaz: I still haven't mastered that yet.
<Skydroid> nope
<valoreins> CCCP: you forgot some people love ALL ponies, even previous generation
<valoreins> lol
<icybeauti> I adit to owning G3 ponies as a child...
<dashierulez> rofl
<ingwaz> icybeauti: well, its just all about knowing where the keys are on your keyboard and knowing what mistake you make when you make one
<Tassadork> teen girl squad in anthology 2...
<sonicandmario85> guys its me brony
<sonicandmario85> i decided to pick dis name :3
<drf|laptop> 03ugh
<icybeauti> ingwaz: I have to look at the keyboard to know what I'm typing,
<Skydroid> wait
<Lil_B> LOL
<icybeauti> sonicandmario85: Just use that name whenever you come here so everypony will reconize you.
<CCCP> valoreins: i know, infact i might be one of those people
<ingwaz> icybeauti: well, for example the past two times i have typed to you, i have done so blindly, with the exception of once openning my eyes to check and make sure i had properly removed a mistake
<Skydroid> There is this button on the top main menu
<VenHur96> 'Allo, Bronies!
<AgentKalim> Hello, VenHur96
<Skydroid> "manage my files"
<sonicandmario85> HELLO
<Lil_B> hi VenHur96
<Skydroid> That worked
<icybeauti> ingwaz: I look at the keyboard during each message.
<Skydroid> I could hold down and delete
<alexxm> hey VenHur96 hows your day been
<AttackWithHugs> Hello, VenHur96
<CrimsonPhoenix> Finally done with the entirety of Anthology2
<VenHur96> alexxm: Same as yesterday.
<Skydroid> Now to check Settings to make sure it deleted them
<sonicandmario85> there is somepony missing in the chat..
<alexxm> ok VebHur96
<sonicandmario85> and its pinkie pie
<CrimsonPhoenix> It started really mediocre but got god a bit after midpoint and on
<sonicandmario85> XD
<drf|laptop> 03you might need to reboot the phone
<Lil_B> dat NC reference
<Skydroid> ...
<CCCP> hi VenHur96
<Skydroid> Okay so
<icybeauti> sonicandmario85: The mods don't usually chat. They're either streaming or AFK most of the time.
<ingwaz> icybeauti: have you taken any typing classes? thats what helped me quite a bit. before that i was unable to type beyond just hunting and pecking. but during the class i got very competitive with a friend about our typing speed which helped as well. now i can average around 80 wpm with few mistakes without looking at the keyboard
<Skydroid> They're gone
<Skydroid> But like
<diddutz> HELLFIRE!
<Skydroid> You know how Android has tons of defaults?
<VenHur96> Is someone streaming as always?
<Skydroid> Only two defaults are left
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<CCCP> hey ingwaz!

*Pattyrick runs
<Ray> 02in caps with bold
<drf|laptop> 03Android has 3 separate partitions
<Lil_B> Dat Mother 3!
<drf|laptop> 03system, data, cache
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: Best do that btw to ping someone to respond to them try typing a bit of their name then press tab that auto finds the name if not keep doing it till it's that users name
<Cobellanez> If I may, can I ask your friend code SuperBrony64?
<drf|laptop> 03there's others too but those don't do much
<icybeauti> It's funny how he asks you and never answers back :D
<alexxm> i've been good Bronysith any idea what was up with it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dken2021: No I wasn't :<
<drf|laptop> 03system is what makes the phone work, e.g. delete it and your phone is a paperweight
<Bronysith> alexxm: it just wasnt working letting me launch
<drf|laptop> 03data is... data
<drf|laptop> 03derp
<drf|laptop> 03cache is just a .... cache that makes the phone run faster
<alexxm> odd
<icybeauti> listenign to part 3 shush!
<Lil_B> I like the gojirra theme
<drf|laptop> 03everything that comes with your phone is stored in system
<drf|laptop> 03apps like phone/messaging/whatever, ringtones, any of the basic things
<icybeauti> play some pony!!!
<Dken2021> I spy a netflix
<drf|laptop> 03any customization is stored in data
<CrimsonPhoenix> https://p.twimg.com/Awvss7MCAAAa-Ct.jpg
<killerpony7733> Dken2021: Ya don't say?
<drf|laptop> 03a factory reset just erases everything in data and cache.
<killerpony7733> :D
<valoreins> FF6 pony!
<Lil_B> FF6 !!!
<Alchemist> Ia bronycon over yet?
<Cobellanez> I never get to play smash bros with anyone. My brother refuses to play it anymore
<CrimsonPhoenix> nope Alchemist
<sonicandmario85> i read all the rules and OMG NETFLIX
<drf|laptop> 03so anything that shipped with the phone, e.g. the stuff I mentioned, isn't affected
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: i approve
<icybeauti> Alchemist: It ends officially at I think 2am
<sonicandmario85> THERES MOVIES ON DERE I HAVE IT TOO
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix dat storntrotter
<drf|laptop> 03oh, any apps you install yourself are stored in data/app
<drf|laptop> 03opposed to system/app which is the non-removable apps that come iwth eit
<drf|laptop> 03make sense? Or am I being too technical :P
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: Did you see what i said you can do to respond to someone or ping them?
<Alchemist> icybeauti 2am GMT or 2 am EST?
<icybeauti> Alchemist: EST
<Skydroid> In simplest terms :p
<sonicandmario85> do i ahve to ping them?
<sonicandmario85> have*
<icybeauti> sonicandmario85: Ping what?
<sonicandmario85> the person im talking too
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: No but you can respond to someone in a more easy way by doing that
<Alchemist> wow, that means it will end around noon tomorrow for me :d
<CrimsonPhoenix> Closing ceremony at 18:00 EST
<Skydroid> ?*
<CrimsonPhoenix> after that people will probably dance, hangout party
<diddutz> oh my god =.(\
<icybeauti> sonicandmario85: If you have soemthign to add to what they're saying, you should, but you genrally don't need to.
<diddutz> dat song
<CrimsonPhoenix> that the room reference
<valoreins> omagod lol
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: hi matt
<icybeauti> Im' lsitenignt o 2112
<Skydroid> Default ringtones are not affected by factory reset?
<valoreins> what a story
<Kandarihu> I'll bet Tortilla Soup must get a lot of views for no reason other than always being Netflix's default selection.
<drf|laptop> 03right.
<Skydroid> same with default apps
<Skydroid> ?
<drf|laptop> 03right
<Alchemist> I've never been to any convention ever. Wonder what it's like...
<Skydroid> k
<Skydroid> Then I can get rid of lolSuperuser
<Dken2021> Alchemist I heard it's sweaty
<Skydroid> It's stuck there
<drf|laptop> 03nope
<drf|laptop> 03superuser is in system
<drf|laptop> 03I was just about to mention that
<Skydroid> The Terminal disappeares
<icybeauti> Alchemist: There were a ton of people, mainly venders, and a lot of cosplaying. There were a few creepers though.
<Skydroid> :<
<CrimsonPhoenix> I've been to Arcadia at MOntreal
<CrimsonPhoenix> once
<Alchemist> I've been to whole night events but that's different.
<drf|laptop> 03now, if you root your phone, you get access to system
<sonicandmario85> superbrony64: watch a mlp episode :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> first time I played the wii and it was on Twilight Princess
<Bronysith> sonicandmario85: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
<Lil_B> I think only 2 people understood why he said" DO you Speak Turkish" In german...
<HyperMetalLugia> but
<drf|laptop> 03you can delete apps from it (like the bloated crap that comes with the phone), as well as add things that aren't affected by resets
<HyperMetalLugia> she can't root
<drf|laptop> 03superuser is stored in system
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<diddutz> icybeauti: SSSsssSSSsssSSSsss BOOOM!
<drf|laptop> 03she can't root because you screwed something up :P
<Ponies47> I go to a couple of conventions a year. But I want to add bronycon to that list as well :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that was just before the wii released
<icybeauti> sonicandmario85: Do suggesting in #vinly_scratch
<drf|laptop> 03the guides are pretty simple
<Alchemist> Dken2021: well its summer so people tend to sweat :D
<HyperMetalLugia> uh
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope
<HyperMetalLugia> I read all the guides
<HyperMetalLugia> and the phone
<Dken2021> yea, there's that too lol
<HyperMetalLugia> is like nearly unrootable
<HyperMetalLugia> or nobody bothered to make an exploit
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know I'll be going at Videogame live at the end of october
<drf|laptop> 03there's an exploit...
<Skydroid> yay Cinti Bell?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> your cincin bell
<HyperMetalLugia> sucks
<drf|laptop> 03it has nothing to do with the phone company
<icybeauti> It wasn't that horrible yesterday. I was able to eat outside with the friend in the shade and we didn' t suffer.
<Alchemist> too bad no conventions are held in hungary, ever...
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF
<HyperMetalLugia> You try to root her phone
<drf|laptop> 03I offered
<HyperMetalLugia> Do it
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<HyperMetalLugia> Sky
<HyperMetalLugia> let him root it
<CrimsonPhoenix> That Dracula reference
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix hope you have good time there, really wish I could go to that
<HyperMetalLugia> .c.
<valoreins> what is man
<icybeauti> Alchemist: You can xtry to make a hungarian brony meetup
<HyperMetalLugia> or try to root
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh Dken2021 I went there last year
<Lil_B> awww.... why not use the original?!
<HyperMetalLugia> the exploit ran
<CrimsonPhoenix> it was boss
<HyperMetalLugia> it installed stuff
<HyperMetalLugia> but
<Skydroid> And if it breaks my phone?
<HyperMetalLugia> it didn't work
<drf|laptop> 03as I was going to say, there's only one proper way to completely reset a phone, including removing superuser and all that
<killerpony7733> Alchemist: If B.U.C.K will be held during next summer i could possibly attend
<Alchemist> icybeauty: there are hungarian brony meetups, but Im interested in conventions
<HyperMetalLugia> still didn't give me the root uid
<icybeauti> CrimsonPhoenix: You went to bronycon when it was still underground?
<drf|laptop> 03and that's flashing the firmware.
<CrimsonPhoenix> no
<CrimsonPhoenix> I went to Video Game Live
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: BUCK is the one held in England?
<sonicandmario85> bobs burgers..
<Skydroid> And if rooting breaks my phone?
<CrimsonPhoenix> a orchestrate concert of video game music held by Tommy Talarico
<icybeauti> CrimsonPhoenix: Cool. Montreal is a looooonnng wasy from where I lvie.
<Skydroid> Cuz it's had glitches, as I've said
<Ponies47> awwww yeah Bob's Burgers time!! :)
<drf|laptop> 03if I can find a firmware flasher
<killerpony7733> Alchemist: Yes with saturn as a chairman
<Skydroid> Didn't have them before
<drf|laptop> 03it can fix it
<sonicandmario85> ON NETFLIX
<drf|laptop> 03I won't try unless one exists
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: already sounds good :D
<drf|laptop> 03Motorola uses .sbf files, other companies use other things
<sonicandmario85> and it has no commercials on netflix :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> THAT GODDAMN FROG
<Ponies47> sonicandmario85: Your point? :)
<Skydroid> We're cut for time also
<drf|laptop> 03well yeah
<sonicandmario85> i never watched it before but i heard about it
<killerpony7733> Alchemist: I live in denmark so for me the costs would be quite acceptable
<Tovler> I could listen to H Jon Benjamin's voice forever
<CrimsonPhoenix> also icybeauti VGL does the show at other places as well so don't worry
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Tovler: IKR
<Ponies47> sonicandmario85: It's a pretty good show.
<AttackWithHugs> Is it buffering for anyone?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02He also does the voice of Archer :3
<icybeauti> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah, I bet they would come to NY
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: Nope
<CrimsonPhoenix> You're in New York?
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: the only way I could go is if I hitch hiked all the way, slept on the street and ate nothing but sunshine and drank nothing but air :D
<Skydroid> I can't just be like, "Ohey, the person I'm meeting is still working on my phone" when I call my parents
<icybeauti> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> dude that's not far from montreal at all
<sonicandmario85> Ponies47:is it an adult or kid show?
<CrimsonPhoenix> probably like 8 hours on car
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<ingwaz> woo, just realized my summer job ends in a bit over a month
<icybeauti> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm in lower Ny next to NYC
<drf|laptop> 03let me see if I can find a firmware flasher, as that's a surefire way to completely reset everything
<drf|laptop> 03what's the model again?
<killerpony7733> Alchemist: Aww, still if B.U.C.K is going to be held next year i can most likely attend
<HyperMetalLugia> something crappy
<Ponies47> sonicandmario85: Airs on Fox so adult I guess. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I forgot
<HyperMetalLugia> .c.
<Skydroid> T759 Exhibit
<CrimsonPhoenix> still shouldn't be THAT much far

*DeathStar dances on SuperBrony64 s head
<icybeauti> GilDash: If you hate london so much, come to NYc for a bit.
<Very_Silly_Filly> When I dunno what you guys are on about, it sounds disurbing...
<Alchemist> Lil_B you mean the panels will be held in primarily in english (for the sake of the invited guests) and translated live?
<GilDash> icybeauti: If I had the money, I would quite possibly take you upon that offer. :)
<sonicandmario85> im eating a raw hotdof without a bun right now XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the end is near
<sonicandmario85> hotdog*
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Oiy

<GilDash> icybeauti: Well, isn't that nice for you. :p
<Ponies47> Condound the buffer! :[
<Om> GilDash: Don't move to america! Its a trap!
<Lil_B> Alchemist I can imagine that... but i can't guarantee, the Trailer was in english and the website too :/
<alexxm> buffering
<Ponies47> *confound
<Very_Silly_Filly> SuperBrony64: Are you playing this on a sexbox 360? :P

<sonicandmario85> nvm
<Tovler> damn buffering. It's like being stuck in bumper to bumper traffic
<GilDash> Om: I didn't say "move" I said spend some time there. If I ever did move countries, it'd probably be Australia.
<Alchemist> *BraunSchweig
<alexxm> sonicandmario85 i suggest adblock
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Very_Silly_Filly: Wii :3
<killerpony7733> GilDash: Why australia? :O

<Lil_B> Alchemist they exept them of course XD what I ment was that all the signs will be in german and english (and maybe even frensh)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, fixing the stream >>
<GilDash> killerpony7733, Om: Meh. 'Cause it's an English speaking country that isn't America or UK, and it needs skilled people there. I was going to go before I dropped out of Uni.
<Pattyrick> Speaking of that, I lost my aviators in Germany when I rode a freakin' insane wooden coaster in the rain :(
<killerpony7733> GilDash: Hm interesting
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Would be more interesting if it had ever happened. :D
*DeathStar helps SuperBrony64 fix the stream by dancing on his head
<Pattyrick> But it was totally worth the ride; it actually ran kinda better in the rain than when it was dry xD
<sonicandmario85> i have firefox is there a built-in adblock?
<Alchemist> Lil_B: what is the convention called again? Galacon? I will look it up. I definitely cant go this year though.

<drf|laptop> 03I think something broke :P
<HyperMetalLugia> oww
<sonicandmario85> SLAMMED ON THE SCREEN LOL
<twilight_sprinkle> aw
<HyperMetalLugia> how'd you manage to break it
<Attack> Why me, computer? What did I ever do to you?
<drf|laptop> 03no idea
<drf|laptop> 03but like
<drf|laptop> 03it shows it as having a soundblaster sound card, but yet... no audio :X
<twilight_sprinkle> and thats why derpy rocks
<drf|laptop> 03and I can't reboot into DOS mode
<drf|laptop> 03something is screwy
<Baily> Attack have you been bad to your PC??? :P
<sonicandmario85> wubwubwub xD
<HyperMetalLugia> using a VM?
<drf|laptop> 03no.
<drf|laptop> 03that's an actual computer
*Skylands just remembered that she bought the jumbo Zorua card from drf
<drf|laptop> 03my old Compaq
<HyperMetalLugia> Cool
<drf|laptop> 03I think I'll wipe it again
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Skylands> 10I like how my dad didn't notice
<drf|laptop> 03HML
<drf|laptop> 03you might know how to fix this
<HyperMetalLugia> Do you have a soundblaster 16?
<Attack> Baily: No. The stream is buffering for me and when it DOES come up, it's basically a screenshot and nothing happens. I've cleared my cache and deleted all my cookies and it still does it.
<drf|laptop> 03the BIOS is stupidly old
<drf|laptop> 03and refuses to see anything over 8GB
<sonicandmario85> i wish i had this game so i chould fight superbrony XD
<drf|laptop> 03so it thinks my 40GB hard drive is only 8
<drf|laptop> 03well
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<drf|laptop> 03Linux, as well as Windows NT-based OSes
<drf|laptop> 03will ignore the BIOS
<drf|laptop> 03so when I installed XP on there, it shows all 40GB
<drf|laptop> 03but 98 uses the BIOS information for hard drive sixe :/
<drf|laptop> 03*size
<drf|laptop> 03any idea how to bypass that? LOL
<sonicandmario85> i whould be sonic because hes my favirote SEGA character :D
<twilight_sprinkle> damn
<HyperMetalLugia> hm
<twilight_sprinkle> sb relies too much on items and the octo thing...
<HyperMetalLugia> I swear I had a 10GB drive in 98
<Baily> MM never had that prom before attack, not sure if there's anything I can help with sorry :(
<HyperMetalLugia> but that was VMed
<HyperMetalLugia> so
<drf|laptop> 03oh, the OS itself supports it
<drf|laptop> 03it's the installer that uses the BIOS
<drf|laptop> 03I dunno if I can use something like Parted Magic
<sonicandmario85> Sonics My Name.Speeds My Game
<drf|laptop> 03to enlarge the partition
<AttackWithHugs> I swear this computer hates me today. It was fine yesterday.
<pony_8540> !
<drf|laptop> 03but what sort of live partitioner would run on only 80MB of RAM? :/
<Michael> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> AttackWithHugs: think about the things you said to it since then, maybe you hurt its feelings
<Michael> dat bomb
<alexxm> AttackWithHugs whats it been doing
<twilight_sprinkle> wtf derpy <.<
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03This file is for machines older than a Pentium III class, such as an i586 or a PII with only one processor. <- will try
<AttackWithHugs> twilight_sprinkle: It wasn't doing this when I woke up this morning
<sonicandmario85> my computers been really getting angry at me and its slowing down because of it and i did nothing to it
<alexxm> tentacle fun
<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds good
<Baily> Do it derp!
<HyperMetalLugia> But you could try
<HyperMetalLugia> extended/logical partitions
<Michael> link special is best special
*NappyGunny is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
<AttackWithHugs> alexxm: The stream doesn't work on my end. All I get is a screenshot and nothing else, even after clearing my cache and deleting cookies
<HyperMetalLugia> but I doubt that'll work cause of the BIOS
<drf|laptop> 03in what o.o
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<AttackWithHugs> alexxm: Same thing happens in Chrome.

<Skylands> 10Salt and vinegar, never seen those
<operatorPony> Strelok: so it IS serv
<Steve> but how are we going to know what blue thinks of her new frends
<Tovler> :( I'm getting a black screen
<Drake> 04They sell them over here, but lately I haven't been able to find any.
<twilight_sprinkle> i missed de Lancies panel so im still oblivious as to why hes so liked, not that i hate him. can someone explain this to me?
<alexxm> Tovler like my mothers soul
<Quick_Thinker> okay i do desrive that kick
<operatorPony> cant someone stream something?
<sonicandmario85> steve blues not even real go somewhere else and roleplay 6 year old
<Shamroc> Quick_Thinker...you do realize we can talk about anything here that doesnt invole gore...saucy saucy stuff...or the likes...
<Shizuka> 13This is not your personal roleplaying channel. Take it elsewhere.
<Strelok> So me saying steve's being obnoxious is against the rules?
<Tovler> there is not 1 photon
<killerpony7733> ^What shizuka said
<Shizuka> 13The subject ends. Now.
<Strelok> Wat
<operatorPony> Shizuka: are you also on /k/?
<Strelok> Well, whatever
<Quick_Thinker> and me trying to stop a rping (i know it was in caps but that was to prove a point even if it failed)
<Strelok> OperatorPony, you should come over some time. You can hang with serv and I
<Lone_Lycan|AFK> Bluebell has a new icecream flavor.... they should've called it Pinkie Pie http://bluebell.com/what_were_crankin_out/new_creations.html
<operatorPony> I do have family in AZ....... I could next time I visit them
<Quick_Thinker> also sterlok i find the autistic comment offensive i have a form of it by i won't take a grudge im sure you didn't know
<Strelok> Shizuka, how did I violate the rules when you kicked me? I can understand not saying "eat a dick", etc.
<Shizuka> 13You did not stop when I told you to.
<Skylands> 10Google for Vinegar and salt Pringles, click on Pringles Wiki page, read about more flavours you've never seen or heard of before
<Strelok> Quick_Thinker, it's like calling something retarded. Not meant to offend, but rather to say the individual is acting in a stupid manner
<Skylands> 10BBQ? I need to try that
<Spectrum_Rush> funny thing involving RPing... there was a larp room at BronyCon...
<Quick_Thinker> fair enough just next time be a bit more careful with your words
<Tovler> :( I'm missing a fight
<sonicandmario85> thats why you obey admins XD
<Skylands> 10Grippo's BBQ chips are <3
<Strelok> Shizuka, stop what? Telling steve to go away?
<Strelok> I'm confused and just want clarification so I don't violate the rules in the future
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04There is a Pringles Wiki.
<Drake> 04Really.
<Shizuka> 13when a mod tells you to stop, you stop
<Strelok> Operatorpony, sounds good. If you need a place to stay for a night or two, I've got a guest room
<Shizuka> 13is that so hard to understand?
<Strelok> Stop what, though?
<Quick_Thinker> has any pony seen Karaoke in a while he's supossed to play with me and AgentKalim in a MLP roleplaying game?
<Skylands> 10Yes

<Skylands> 10Oh

<Meanwhile> Sumica: Yeah that too.
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Do you drink black tea?
*Bronysith gives slag out
<Strelok> Anyhow, operatorpony, I don't see how I was violating any rules. The whole "eat a dick" thing was obviously against the rules, but I don't see how calling the guy annoying is
<drf|laptop> 03hi
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: No. I have had black green tea, if that counts.
<Ponies47> Yeehaw! I go home to Wisconsin tomorrow! But I have to do the 7 hour car ride AGIAN -_-

<alexxm> Strelok if you ignored he would have gone away you giving him what he wanted
<icybeauti> I love tea though. Herbal is my personal favorite, with honey.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile shizu wants me to draw her and vivi and i'm scared ;A;

<Strelok> Alexxm, so he's an attention whore?
<Strelok> :I
*Bronysith holds TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Close enough. Black tea is the most common in England.
<Tovler> I'm now watching Gravity Falls, the cartoon Rob Renzetti dumped MLP for. I can see why; it's sooo much better.
<alexxm> seemed like one to me Strelok
<Strelok> Me too
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: How does it taste?

<Kipkat07_USAF> Shamroc: not you tho *huggles*
<Shamroc> Phase4: how hard did you fail?
<Eztio--> Bronysith: i rate them equally good as ocarina is an adventure while majora's mask has a darker tone.
<Phase4> 00,02Shamroc, the truth/lie/doubt gets more and more bullshit the further along you get doesnt it?
*Kipkat07_USAF cries
<Shamroc> Bronysith..really thats not needed

<Bronysith> Meanwhile: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1699/

<Vordox> Spade-Magnes[R]: Get eating
*Eztio-- omnoms on bag of cheetoes
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i am impressed
*Spade-Magnes[R] eats a matter wave hat
<AgentKalim> Waaait
<AgentKalim> is this Sea Ponies I hear?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and now there is a line acroos half of my drawing ....
<Shamroc> Sumica: now press self destruction button..
*Kipkat07_USAF eats a bacon
<Meanwhile> It's not the first time he's landed this plane.

<CriticKitten> And then it explodes
*Biglaw ejects
<Calcos323> I need pics Spade-Magnes[R]
<Eztio--> *cough* anyone have some water or gatorade?
<Sumica> 00,10and now a 24km taxy home
<DeadpoolDash> damn it, i hate it when all the TF2 servers I go to are full
<Phase4> 00,02why wont it stop?
<lunac> DON'T change the design
<CrimsonPhoenix> You know you have a problem with MLP when you recognize an episode with a single screenshot.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: your really getting quite good at this
<VenHur96> Mother of Celestia...I...I think I growned a beard from that landing...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Bronysith remind me to kill you later k' ?
<Sumica> 00,10they never invented breaks and it's on a hill
<Spade-Magnes[R]> CrimsonPhoenix: You say problem I say love of the show
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: kill me later
<Calcos323> Sumica: Brakes
<lunac> Sumica's like, "Sod it I'll drive it to the airbase"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Bronysith thanks
<Spade-Magnes[R]> And then he crashes it
<AgentKalim> CrimsonPhoenix: If it's a moment that's integral to the episode, then that's just good retention, not a problem. :P
<Sumica> 00,10them too
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT kills Bronysith
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spade-Magnes[R], it's all in a humorous way
<Kipkat07_USAF> Nopony remembers I was gone.... :'( :'(
*Bronysith dies and regenerates into the 43rd Bronysith
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i'd recomend changing the engines on the wings, those are 175 thrust while the good turbo's are 150 and use bugger all fuel
<lunac> lol
<Vordox> You're picking up speed...
*Ponies47 Pokes Kipkat07_USAF 'HI!' :)
<Eztio--> LOVE AND TOLERATE THE $&%@ out of dem people
<Meanwhile> And then he drives into the sea and they all die.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> 20 bits he crashes it anyway
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: im a timelord sith
<AgentKalim> I'm pretty sure this song is a remix of Sea Ponies. :P
<sonicandmario85> GO BACK INTO SPACE AND FIND THE MOON AND GO ON IT

<Calcos323> Ponies47: I'll say it again: Nothing compares to JayB. The only reason I'm promoting him so much is because he really needs more views

<Sumica> 00,10guess I dont need ramscoops

<Eztio--> Can any of the mods make it to the sun??
<AgentKalim> Marx: It was pretty good, but a few bad scenes bring it down a little. Like what the fuck was with that scene where Applebloom gets Sephiroth's hair as a cutie mark? That. Is. Not. Funny.
<Phase4> 00,02staging failure is best failure

<MagnetMarket> They want tolerance for their own beliefs, yet they don't tolerate homosexuals.
<otakon> MagnetMarket: honestly, I say let people live how they want if it doesn't hurt anyone else.
<VenHur96> Documentarys are BORING...
<MagnetMarket> Nothing but a bunch of hypocrisy.

<RAWRity> we should watch "Surviving the Cut" sometime on here. That shit is crazy.
<VenHur96> DeathStar: It's isnt? ... *gets popcorn* For the plot, folks! FOR THE PLOT!
<otakon> Narolas: agreed
<MagnetMarket> CCCP: You can have my BONY in your MOUTH
<Sumica> 00,10for the record, for somthing to have the "based on a true story" tag it only has to be around 10% true.
<CCCP> O_O

<AgentKalim> ^
<MagnetMarket> when bronies fought for their freedom
<cachi01> hoofy_potter: just what I needed

<MagnetMarket> To watch whatever they please.

<RAWRity> Sumica: you should stream "Surviving the Cut" sometime. It documents real-life military personel training. I watched the Spec Ops one, and JESUS do those guys have some endurance.
<Ponies47> Sumica: Sounds good to me. :)
<CCCP> otakon: actually most of them were dead and didn't have guts anymore

<CCCP> killerpony7733: well you do have a point
<Narolas> I don't know why people call it a documentary really, it's not, it's movie heavily Barbetos based on true stories, but it's still a movie telling a focused story
<Sumica> 00,10Hows the quality?

<cachi01> DeadpoolDash: kotaku is always a good read :)

<VenHur96> and be a family man?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: ^
<otakon> RAWRity: still ridiculous and the fact that not all of them made it back meant they went through all that shit for absolutely NOTHING.
<RAWRity> In the military they have 2 goals: Make you into the strongest physical specimen possible, break you until you follow orders without a single pause.
<otakon> so, make you cattle?
<AgentKalim> Are you going to bitch about every single thing? :P Welcome to the army.
<AgentKalim> YES
<AgentKalim> Yes exactly
<RAWRity> otakon: they went through this shit to help make sure that at least SOME of them got back.
<operatorPony> RAWRity: not necassarilla yabad thing
<Sumica> 00,10but think of what could have happend if they were not as tough as they were.
<MagnetMarket> You don't have to come back alive to make a contribution
<GarrettBrony> its raining Men Hallalieua
<Spriggals> No bastone
<RAWRity> operatorPony: i'm not saying it's a good or a bad thing. It's something necessary to have a military function.

<hoofy_potter> GO GO GO GO!

<GarrettBrony> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Hey thats what I said
<hoofy_potter> meet the soldier helmet dude
<Ingwaz> otakon: any reason in particular why you think i should go for it? you know...the lack of similar tastes, fact that i dont know her...at all...and she normally lives 2 hours away, not really sure how to approach that
<VenHur96> Sorry for my absence, I accidently hits the back key...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol
<Irish_Pony> LIKE A BOSS
<cachi01> yay
<AgentKalim> Ingwaz: You can always just see her once and then drop it.
<otakon> Ingwaz: for the hell of it. I did a blind date like that once. nothing came of it except for a night out though.
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: I say at least go on one date. You may find you like her despite dissimilar tastes. Plus, nothing ventured nothing gained.
<MagnetMarket> I think Katniss Everdeen said it best. "There is something inherently wrong with a creature that uses its own children's lives to settle its differences

<BlueFlare> 02well, it is china. She's probably very poor and doesn’t have the money for it
<CriticKitten> yeah, lolno. The Anthology doesn't need streaming. It's kind of mediocre actually, starts to drag late.
<operatorPony> GarrettBrony: the brits are so much better to make fun of though
<AgentKalim> Kiwi fucking? :P
<otakon> AgentKalim: no, NZ'rs
<Ponies47> sub06905: I hope. I hope I can find some might get up extra early and ask my mom to drive me over there and see. :P

<Quick_Thinker> man every other pony either lives not far away form the con's or is old enought to leave the state on their own :C
<cachi01|anthology> anthology II was epic but suddenly lmfao :|
<Meanwhile> I think it's only a crash if the operator doesn't say "Restarting" first Shamroc.
<CreativePonyName> wait theirs another anthology ?
<cachi01|anthology> CreativePonyName: just released :)
<Ponies47> sub06905: No it's just shirts. Ah good the store opens at 6:00 AM and we're gonna leave at about noon so plenty of time for me ^_^
<BlueFlare> 02just a sec, there's plenty of stuff that says that
<CreativePonyName> will it be on the stream later?
<Meanwhile> Personally I thought the second Anthology was kinda dry.
<cachi01|anthology> Meanwhile: the beggining was hilarious
<Narolas> Meanwhile: Oh dear, haven't seen it and i though the frist one was kinda meh
<sonicandmario85> im gonna play kerbal space program demo XD

<hen3ry> 10k was a fair amount of money
<AgentKalim> cachi01|anthology: Hey, don't be buttmad. I don't like that song either. But that song coupled with the scene where Pinkie Pie has a party with a bunch of inanimate objects, including some rocks.... you mean you DON'T think that's funny?
<Meanwhile> AgentKalim: No. :I
<SolairePony89> sagas: Adjust for inflation, and I'm sure it's a lot more than that
<operatorPony> Shizuka: type MOTD in chat
<sagas> 10k was good considering you had like a 50/50 chance of dying
<Kenboneboss> What movie is this guys
<Spriggals> TONAIGHT
<flutter_spin> lol
<SolairePony89> Kenboneboss: It's a TV show called Band of Brothers
<AgentKalim> Night of nights

<Spriggals> Day of days
<Vordox> Sumica: Why do I have a feeling without Ross there, it'll go to hell? :P

<Meanwhile> Shizuka: you turn it off again?
<Shizuka> 13yeah
<Sumica> 00,10Ross gets them them lost
<sagas> Damn, 10k in 1943 is like 132k today
<hen3ry> it'll be hell either way tho
<Meanwhile> That'll be why Sending Client Info is taking forever then.
<Irish_Pony> :D
<RAWRity> ooh, Dear John letter
<sagas> inflation you scary...
<High_Flyer> thats a bad way to learn your brother was killed.
<Vordox> Sumica. Is this a series? or the movie?
<sagas> Vordox: series
<Sumica> 00,10Serise
<hen3ry> D-Day was a clusterfuck, which mainly suceeded because the operation was pulled off in a way that fooled the Germans worse than it fooled the Allies.
<operatorPony> Monte Casio was a rough battle
<AgentKalim> ^
<hen3ry> "They're all scattered - holy shit, there must be ten times more of them then there really are!"
<operatorPony> D-Day was what pushed American forces into EUrope, right?
<Skylands> 10Not everything on the internet is fact
<hen3ry> into France.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/iFPA8.jpg Oh wow
<hen3ry> The allies were already in Italy
<Skylands> 10and I don't see how one is better over the other until proven otherwise
<RAWRity> D-day was essentially this: "THROW ALL THE TROOPS AT THE BEACH!"
<Vordox> wow...
<Narolas> D-Day was when the american troops arrived on the french coast, yes
<operatorPony> CrimsonPhoenix: nice
<Lambda> It's been so lo.g
<AgentKalim> CrimsonPhoenix: What is this heresy
<High_Flyer> hen3ry: even with our fake, the only reason it wasn't a complete bloodbath was because we fed false info through spies that we had failed the beach landing. germans got no reinforcements for a ew days
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: ALL the troops? :c
<Vordox> David Schwimmer isn't in the credtits of stars on IMDB
<Vordox> XD
<SolairePony89> American, British and Canadian
<CrimsonPhoenix> operatorPony, you don't get it
<Lambda> *long
<SolairePony89> ...troops
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: ALL THE TROOPS!
<operatorPony> CrimsonPhoenix: hmm?
<Sumica> 00,10Which troops?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lyra shares Bonbon
<hen3ry> High_Flyer: well, yes, British spais proved they were the best in the world.
<Ponies47> Welp. I gotta go now. BYR EVERYPONY! :)
<RAWRity> Sumica: ALL
<CrimsonPhoenix> to Carrot Top
<RAWRity> ALL OF THEM
<Barbetos> Lyra is cheating on Bon Bon with Carrot Top.
<AgentKalim> CARRRRROOTTT TOPPP
<RAWRity> AND HAVE THEM BE LED BY TOM HANKS.
<Quick_Thinker> so D-Day HAD A GODDAMN PLAN XD
<operatorPony> boohoo
<SolairePony89> Cya Ponies47, try to havce fun
<AgentKalim> Carrot Top is heresy
<hen3ry> the whole war would have been lost if not for British counter-intel, several times
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh contraire Barbetos
<Narolas> Oh right sorry, american, british and canadian troops, not just americans
<BlueFlare> 02like I said, it's not significant. But the real thing is always better
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's the THREESOME
<Lambda> Since I've been here, do you know our news?
<Om> Nothing like eating your first meal at 7pm
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lyra, Bonbon and Carrot Top
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> one of my history teachers in high school told us a story about how the Allies put inflatable tanks and ships at the point nearest to south Britain which moved the Nazis to that location, leaving Normandy beaches a mere fraction of the force it should have been
<SolairePony89> RAWRity: I'd gladly follow Tom Hanks, even on Omaha
<hen3ry> to the point that Hitler at some point decided he wouldn't let the Brits troll him yet again, and ignored it when REAL intel fell into his forces hands.
<High_Flyer> hen3ry: ya. they tricked the germans in north africa by putting bad intel on a random dead body in a plane the british crashed off of the spanish coast.
<Lambda> It was hinted at in our previous conversation
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> or rather the Nazis planned
<operatorPony> those trading cards seem pretty cool
<operatorPony> I want the one with Time Turner
<AgentKalim> Hu
<hen3ry> Yup, Patton's inflatable army
<AgentKalim> oh, the Doctor
<dukedontnukem> what`s this?
<Shizuka> 13balloonicorn?
<Skylands> 10lol.
<flutter_spin> balloony?
<RAWRity> one way the British spread false info to the germans: they put fake documents and maps onto a corpse, then dumped it out into the ocean near the german coast dressed in a general's uniform.
<VenHur96> balloonicorn.
<AgentKalim> baloney
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i've just started getting that sas problem
<Phase4> 00,02rockets spinning for no reason
<dukedontnukem> what movie is this?
<Narolas> The reason this war was won is thanks to everyone, every country that sent soldiers, and every french spies and members of the resistance that actually made the D-day possible. The french resistance even sacrificed members that were told fake information about D-Day so the germans would not expect it where it actually was
<Sumica> 00,10yup
<Shizuka> 13yaaay it worked
<Shizuka> 13server is back up
<RAWRity> dukedontnukem: TV miniseries Band of Brothers

<High_Flyer> in conclusion, Allies kicked flank, Nazis bit the dust and we were all happy for about ten minutes until the cold war started.
<Narolas> I always find it frustrating how people forget the french resistance, those people never surrendered, and sacrificed a lot, especially considering this was THEIR country they saw getting destroyed by the nazis
<Sumica> 00,10if you mount two of them Phase4 flip one so they counter balence
<Vordox> Narolas: Because the winners who shout the most, gets the most.
<VenHur96> ....I see what he did there...
<RAWRity> You know, I have to wonder if the guy who shot Archduke Ferdinand realized how much of an effect he'd have on history. It's nearly 100 years later, and we're STILL dealing with the fallout from that one assassination.
<operatorPony> http://lilmisswaffles.deviantart.com/#/d55l05r
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, not sure what you meen
<Narolas> Vordox : yup, lot's of unsung french heroes in this war
<Sumica> 00,10the small sas, dont mount them in pairs
<flutter_spin> you know what is scary operatorPony ? I thought it was a rocket all along
<High_Flyer> Narolas: i always bring up the french resistence when talking about WWII, mainly because the resistence tended to be more successful than the actual french army
<Vordox> Narolas: Not just that, we in Sweden gets alot of shit for being passive....Most people here do not even KNOW what happened in Sweden wth Nazi.
<Sumica> 00,10use only one or flip one of them over to prevent the torque issue
<operatorPony> flutter_spin: I t hoguht it was a PENIS
<Narolas> vordox : Some were in my family, my grandfather even got send to a nazi camp
<Marx> Yeah, I'm beat from all the craziness of these past two days, so I'm going to bed. See ya.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i didnt
<Phase4> 00,02just the command module and nosecone sas
<High_Flyer> everyone also forgets that italy rose up during the war under their king and captured/hung Mussolini.
<SolairePony89> Have a good sleep Marx
<Sumica> 00,10remember the hover jet thing I made Phase4? it had 4 of them. it makes the issue verry noticaable
<Quick_Thinker> if i rember correctly werent these planes built to lose even an entire wing section and still fly?
<Spriggals> Not everyone..
<sonicandmario85> im eating an apple right now XD
<operatorPony> Quick_Thinker: I dont thnk so
<Sumica> 00,10they could take a pounding Quick_Thinker, but not that much
<BlueFlare> 02Formulated does have its benefits though. Like when you’re in public
<High_Flyer> Quick_Thinker; not lose that much, but still take a ton of damage and be cheap to build in large quantities
<BlueFlare> 02|D
<Sumica> 00,10they also can tow a glider behind them
<Narolas> High_Flyer: It's sadly true. There's a lot of things to take into account though, shouldn't just assume the army was bad . the blitzkrieg shocked and surprised everyone, and the overall way europe was seeing the possibility of a war (they were so scared because they remembered the first one, they tried to ignore the signs) that the troops just weren't prepared
<GarrettBrony> yep
<SolairePony89> Yugoslavia had the one of the best partisan fighting forces during the whole war. They actually managed to free themselves from Nazi control from resistance fighters alone
<Phase4> 00,02O_O
<Skylands> 10Pfft
<AgentKalim> Quick_Thinker: You're thinking the B-52 flying fortress. Those things could take a fuckton of damage and stay in the air.
<Quick_Thinker> sat wall
<Phase4> 00,02i was spin stabalizing my rocket
<Phase4> 00,02then the command module just fell off
<operatorPony> SolairePony89: yeah the Yugos here awesome
<Sumica> 00,10over torked
<Light_Latias> 12bathrooms
<Phase4> 00,02no warning, just pop
<Light_Latias> 12this is all
<Sumica> 00,10er torqued
<HyperMetalLugia> breastfeeding is free.
<HyperMetalLugia> just saying
<Spriggals> Part2 noaw!
<operatorPony> the Polish resistance was great too but couldn't win
<Phase4> 00,02wasnt moving fast
<BlueFlare> 02yeah
<hen3ry> I had the same issue with my mini-shuttle.
<RAWRity> Funfact: because of weight restrictions, armoring for planes was very restricted. The way they decided on where the planes needed to be most guarded was by examing planes that returned from the field, and placing armor on the places that never showed any bullet holes.
<sub06905> lotsa planes 0.0
<SolairePony89> The hopes and prayers of liberty loving people march with you
<HyperMetalLugia> saves the parents lots of money in the end
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<SolairePony89> Aww
<hen3ry> Shuttle not spinning at all, not under any torque, approaching the moon with a rocket still under it for counterburn... boom, lander's rocket just snaps off.
<Narolas> The entirety of europe resisted and sacrificed, but we only remember the winning soldiers from d-day
<BlueFlare> 02And it’s more sanitary
<RAWRity> The logic being that any parts that WERE damaged were areas that could be hit and still allow the plane to function.
<BlueFlare> 02for the baby
<SolairePony89> I swear there's more to that speech then was shown
<Quick_Thinker> well this was the war when we did our most ssupport to any way ever if i do remember it well bu then again i may be wrong
<otakon> RAWRity: wait WAIT, they armored the portions that WEREN'T hit? the helll logic is htat?
<Sumica> 00,10there is SolairePony89
<Sumica> 00,10but it was a long speach
<cachi01|anthology> FUCK YEAH FUCKING DIO IN ANTHOLOGY II \m/:[\m/
<hen3ry> otakon: if a plane took damage in one of those places it didn't return, therefore that spot needed armor
<Quick_Thinker> otakon its pinkie pie logic
<VenHur96> *clop* Nice movie, even for 1942 standards...
<GarrettBrony> is this all for the 4 of july?
<otakon> RAWRity: what about the pilots? since you know without them THE PLANE CAN'T FLY ITSELF
<flutter_spin> woot! Anthology 2!
<SolairePony89> Sumica: I only really remember that speech from MoH: Frontline
<otakon> GarrettBrony: eeyup
<hen3ry> it's pinkie logic, but it's brilliant pinkie logic
<Vordox> Silly Fluttershy, you don't have fingers, cachi01|anthology
<Spriggals> Part 2 next plz :)
<cachi01|anthology> Vordox: lol
<High_Flyer> did anypony leave a comment for Blue Breeze on fimfiction?
<GarrettBrony> America FUCK YAH
<AgentKalim> otakon: You're not thinking about it enough. They armored the untouched spots on the planes that RETURNED.
<RAWRity> otakon: they DID do their best to protect the pilots. The goal was to armor the plane to protect its most vital areas.
<drf|laptop> 03not that anybody minds breasts in public though
<Vordox> I still say MoH is the cloest to ACTUALY BUCKING GOOD War Game with feel
*drf|laptop runs
<Spriggals> ^
<Vordox> CoH and BF got nothing against the story telling of MoH
<Quick_Thinker> no pony left a comment for my fic Quick Thinker :(
<operatorPony> yeah, if you armor a plane you weigh it down too much
<Biglaw> http://fav.me/d55qzus post HBO picture by yours truly? :(
<Irish_Pony> oi! Shizuka need you for a moment
<Shizuka> 13ohai
<otakon> RAWRity: ah, so the crew was obviously not in the most vital areas. I see.
<Sumica> 00,10I liked MoH
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<flutter_spin> lol, you do fanfics too Quick_Thinker ?
<operatorPony> Quick_Thinker: :(
<otakon> Sumica: the first one is a utter classic
<Quick_Thinker> only a few
<GarrettBrony> its like a sports cup for planes
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: 2 things 1. panda drew this for you http://imgur.com/xUf2r and 2. PM panda :P
<cachi01|anthology> MoH rising sun was my first FPS
<Quick_Thinker> i have a seperate account on Fanfic
<Kandarihu> So, streaming Band of Brothers in advance of Independance Day?
<otakon> Sumica: and the PS2 first one was good too, Frontline and ll that
<RAWRity> otakon: or, more likely, there's only so much armor ou can put on the cockpit without it destroying their visibility.
<Sumica> 00,10and yes part 2 is next
<Spriggals> YES
<Shizuka> 13awwwww
<otakon> RAWRity: true
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I had frontline
<High_Flyer> :O someone should SO stream Patriot
<Shizuka> 13wuuuuuuuuuuuuub
<flutter_spin> Nice. I'm in the process of a trilogy with a few Bronystate OCs in it
<SolairePony89> Sumica: Anthology 2 or BoB episode 2?
<Kandarihu> Sumica, /)
<RAWRity> and I don't get what you're arguing about the pilots. The pilots getting back kind of ties in with the plane returning.
<otakon> Shizuka: is that you?
<High_Flyer> anthology
<flutter_spin> YES
<hen3ry> rethink it, otakon. Let's say a plane comes back safely with a tailwing shot up to hell. Logically, that means shooting at the tail doesn't matter, therefore _don't_ waste armor weight there. By process of elimination you get the places that really matter.
<Spriggals> moh allied assault was the best.
<Sumica> 00,10BoB 2 is next
<Phase4> 00,02this one just explodes sometimes
<flutter_spin> awww
<hen3ry> which does include the cockpit
<Sumica> 00,10then a intermition, then part 3
<Phase4> 00,02no warning, just falls apart on pad
<SolairePony89> I still occasionally go back and play Frontline. Game never stops being fun
<otakon> Phase4: lol
<SolairePony89> Same goes for CoD2
<otakon> hen3ry: no, I know what your saying.
<flutter_spin> wait, how long is this?
<Quick_Thinker> hen3ry you are putting a lot of thought into a coomment that has went by at 50mph
<GarrettBrony> its raining men
<Sumica> 00,10that is a signe of the game engin breaking down Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02probably
<Sumica> 00,10time for a restart

<Quick_Thinker> well yeah im a quick thinker not a SMART THINKER

<VenHur96> I AM A MAN! ...Wait, I'm a pony...
<Sumica> 00,10Oh hi rain
<Shizuka> 13look look
<otakon> hiya Rain how are you?
<High_Flyer> Kenboneboss: yes. just yes
*Rain hugs Shizuka <3
<Shizuka> 13[21:23] [ Irish_Pony] Shizuka: 2 things 1. panda drew this for you http://imgur.com/xUf2r and 2. PM panda :P
<Vordox> The whole EU was against Hitler to try and get some control, then USA come in at the end and then take the spoils when it's the weakest? :P
<Sumica> 00,10it's Band of brotheres
<Rain> Im good, otakon
<GarrettBrony> VenHur96: PUNCH!
<VenHur96> Hi Rain.
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Phase4> 00,02now it doesnt instant explode
<drf|laptop> 03or like, any straight male?
<AgentKalim> Quick_Thinker: What, is that a catchphrase now something, like "I'm a doctor, not an x"? :P
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: Im just the messenger :P
<otakon> WHERE IS PANDA?
<Quick_Thinker> i guess :$
<otakon> that magnificent bastard!
<BlueFlare> 02well really, people shouldn't mind
<hen3ry> Vordox: More like the whole EU was conquered by Hitler, except the UK, then the USA came in to give the UK the muscle and materiel they needed (UK already had the brains)
<GarrettBrony> Hey we should Stream ID4 on July 4th
<otakon> I must thank him myslef
<Rain> oh dear god, its Shizupyro
<SolairePony89> Vordox: Not even close
<otakon> GarrettBrony: maybe, maybe. we are getting BoB though
<operatorPony> GUys, anyone else here liek guns?
<Narolas> Another episode ?
<AgentKalim> Pyrozuka
<Kenboneboss> What the brown?
<otakon> operatorPony: nope, not a gun otaku.
<BlueFlare> 02I mean, guys are allowed to show that part of their body XD
<Vordox> Not to be rude or anything, but I prefer logical thinkgin. :P
<Narolas> Wait, shit, i don't have time for a new one T_T
<High_Flyer> operatorPony: yes
<Rain> Shizuka that is EPIC
<GarrettBrony> otakon what does BoB mean?
<flutter_spin> Band of Brothers
<otakon> GarrettBrony: Band of Brothers
<GarrettBrony> oh.
<operatorPony> I got acustom AR15 on the way with a Pony oriented serial nummber
<GarrettBrony> Band of Bronies
<AgentKalim> BoB's Burgers :P
<Kandarihu> When we were fighting WWII, it was a total war on our end. Every aspect of our economy was dedicated to the war.
<panda-drawing> Irish_Pony why did you want me in here?
<FlareChaser> panda-drawing!
<Shizuka> 13<3333
<operatorPony> AgentKalim: I likded that stream the other night
<hen3ry> The UK could not have defeated Hitler without the US' help... the result of a WW2 with no USA entry probably would have been the Iron Curtain being the English Channel.
<NullRadix> Quick_Thinker: did I read something about a fic you needed readers for? pm it to me
<GarrettBrony> this chat is a band of Bronies
<LoyalDash> Dat Shizu.:3
<Irish_Pony> panda-drawing: theres your reason :P
<SolairePony89> Kandarihu: Same with every member of both the Axis and Allies
<hen3ry> The USSR would have taken all of Europe
<Quick_Thinker> sure
<FlareChaser> panda-drawing, Shizuka and otakon want to say thanks :)

<Irish_Pony> Rain: its war, just because you throw your hands up doesnt mean theyre still not gonna shoot you
<RAWRity> What I've had to do now is make fluff about how SSD represents the next evolution in data storage.

<SolairePony89> Yup
<operatorPony> RAWRity: is that you?
<SirGanjalf> shit
<Spriggals> Spears at his finest.
<RAWRity> operatorPony: ...surewhynot
<London> Saturn: :(
<Rain> . . .
<superretroworld> american gets killed. fluttershy: 'yay'
<London> ...
<Irish_Pony> otakon: cant keep prisoners when the enemy is all around you can you?
<London> Saturn: :(
<Irish_Pony> London: really?
<SolairePony89> Murder the prisoners. Yeah, America is totally always in the white!
<Sumica> 00,10Fluttershy revels in the death of trators
<SirGanjalf> war, gentlecolts
<SolairePony89> Irish_Pony: Still not an excuse to KILL THEM
<Iron_Edge> Irish_Pony: -lol
<otakon> Irish_Pony: yeah, but executing PoW's is definitely against the Geneva Convention.
<cachi01|anthology> anthology had crazy train..... they cut the awesome intro riff with some bullshit rap or idk what :l
<Barbetos>
<Saturn> 08,01i hate the buses here
<Saturn> 08,01i hate the people
<Sumica> 00,10Was the Geneva convention around at this time?
<cachi01|anthology> the beatiful people
<otakon> Saturn: you'll be home soon
<SirGanjalf> ^yes
<SolairePony89> The Nazis obeyed the Geneva Convention (when it comes to the western front anyway)
<otakon> Sumica: eeyup pretty sure.
<Saturn> 08,01and i hate the way my nostrils are clogged up with black gunk
<Spriggals> Can't hate the women can you?
<SolairePony89> Eastern front... not so much
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol sheesh.
<cachi01|anthology> theres no place like home Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i shit you not
<RAWRity> thank of it this way: you keep them alive, you have to feed them, guard them to prevent escape, and keep them with you. You kill em? You say they got killed in the line of fire and move on with your most likely short remainder of your life.
<SolairePony89> Sumica: Pretty sure it was set up after WWI
<Irish_Pony> otakon: so tell me this, if you captured 10 enemies, enemies counterattack, enemies get prisoners back, its war logic, its a smart move no matter how sick it may seem
<otakon> Spriggals: unless I know here personally and she's a bitch, not off the bat.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh god .... i knew i was forgeting something important ...
<otakon> Irish_Pony: well fuck, kill the children too since by that logic they'll want revenge for their father's deaths.
<SolairePony89> Irish_Pony: They weren't killed for that reason though. They were killed because one soldier went badshit bonkers
<hen3ry> otakon: Ah, you've read Machiavelli too, right?
<RAWRity> otakon: and thus you have Ghengis Kahn's way of life.
<Ghost30k> why are you all talking about Rarity?
<otakon> hen3ry: no, i'm being mentally repugnant atm.
<RAWRity> Ghost30k: because http://i.imgur.com/LaMT8.jpg
<Irish_Pony> SolairePony89: you cant be too careful, kill one, the rest jump you
<hen3ry> otakon: Fair enough.
<otakon> Ghost30k: girl cosplayed as her, she's very busty in a skimpy dress.
<Ghost30k> ahhh
<Ghost30k> so i'm not the only one watching Band of Brothers
<otakon> but she looks like she's enjoying herself too
<hen3ry> Crazy soldier killed prisoners illegally. It happens in war, it's not right but it happens.
<otakon> Ghost30k: enope
<SirGanjalf> SolairePony89: I concur. The moment that guy appeared, I knew some shit would happen.
<Ghost30k> otakon: okay that's good
<SirGanjalf> Oh, and that "See you around"
<Spriggals> That crazy soldier is Spears.
<SolairePony89> Irish_Pony: He shoudn't of killed any though! And one group of soldiers isn't gonn that big of a difference on a frontline with MILLIONS of troops on both sides
<RAWRity> otakon: well of course. She's at bronycon in the compan of a fine gentleman such as Fancy Pants
<otakon> brb need a drink
<Spriggals> Dat werchmant
<otakon> RAWRity: eeyup, I do hope she had a good time. Hell, I hope everyone that went there had a good time.
<sonicandmario85> the ponys dancing at them XD
<otakon> brb drink
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Fml... well i'll make it up in the next one ....
<Irish_Pony> SolairePony89: every man counts when your defending or attacking, no matter how big your army is
<RAWRity> otakon: as long as nobody got set on fire, i'd say it was a succesful Con
<SirGanjalf> mortars?
<MahBoi777> pew pew pew
<Sumica> 00,10they dont have heavy weapons
<Sumica> 00,10they are paratroopers
<Phase4> 00,02everythings too fragile in ksp
<Spriggals> They have some rpgs
<Sumica> 00,10wonder if that guys name is Charly
<Spriggals> But not atm
<Vordox> Suicdal Tree person
<MahBoi777> tree is best cover
<Sumica> 00,10i hear he's in the trees
<Vordox> HAH
<SolairePony89> Irish_Pony: Killing prisoners still isn't a good idea. It'll build hate in the enemy army and make them less likely to surrender and more likely to fight to the death, which means more losses. And sense every man counts, looseing a few men wouldn't be good.
<Vordox> Triple grenade charge. :P
<Vordox> 5 nazies.
<Rain> them were some small ass nades
<Rain> small ass fuses*
<Spriggals> 5 werchmant*
<sonicandmario85> also if anyones wondering im 9 years old
<Sumica> 00,10ass shot
<otakon> RAWRity: agreed, something akin to that happened at Otacon about 2 years ago, someone pulled an alarm and they had to evacuate 20K people into the Inner Harbor in Baltimore. The cosplayers mingled in the middle of tourist season. Fun stuff.
<Iron_Edge> Phase4: Tell me about it. I nearly get to space and suddenly the G force angle angle of trajectory causes my wings near the tip of my craft to break off and slice/explode into my thrusters >:3
<RAWRity> Rain: most nades you get 3 seconds.
<otakon> dat Thompson
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka Rain http://ponycharacter.deviantart.com/#/d55r5cd Don't kill me please(?)
<OtakuTom> Now I'm thinking of Forrest Gump, Sumi :P
*Gunthler|Zzz is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
<superretroworld> MahBoi777: tree is your guardian angel in vietnam, thanks fluttershy
<RAWRity> otakon: well, apparently there was a short fire on stage at Bronycon this morning.

<RAWRity> otakon: one of the lights when splodey. nobody was hurt and the con runners got stuff under control real quick.
<SirGanjalf> dat garand
<operatorPony> Quick_Thinker: I think the german ones were NOT shrapnal grenades
<otakon> RAWRity: nice
<Vordox> THAT'S NOT HOW YOU SHOOT AROUND CORNER.
<SolairePony89> FUCKED UP HIS ASS
<Iron_Edge> Phase4: -lol I will but the way I am set it will only take you to about the uppermost layer of atmosphere before everything starts going outa wack. I've tried everything with that ship >:3 so hope you have better luck than me -lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<otakon> SirGanjalf: ah, the M1 Garand one of the finest semi-auto's ever made.
<superretroworld> sounds like he got rapped by a nazi
<Irish_Pony> SolairePony89: then thats when you have to be careful of how many you kill, kill to little, enemy isnt intimadated well enough and will possibly get that force back, kill too many, then thats when what you say happens
<Spriggals> If hes lucky he will get a female nurse.
<otakon> superretroworld: shot in the ass.

<Ghost30k> what's the difference in theaters?
<Vordox> The grenades are dangerous in a upward angle.
<SirGanjalf> otakon: I could recognize that "no ammo left " sound anytime
<RAWRity> do what the Inglorious Basterds did: kill all but one, then send him back to spread your legend with a Swaztika carved into his forehead.
<otakon> operatorPony: yeah, but the siderooms are closed atm.
<SolairePony89> otakon: The luck has been doubled!
<Vordox> Not the low angle, much higher chance of missing
<otakon> SirGanjalf: yeah, but still a fine gun

<flutter_spin> RAWRity: I really liked a lot of the references, about 1/4 of it. There were so many that were "hey a song... I don't know"
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Eh, it's "okay".
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: if by "okay" you mean so overly-long and one-note.
<GarrettBrony> Cloud then how are you watching this if you are still in the Army. Do your friends know you are a bronie?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> <.<
<Vordox> Rule nr 1 = YOu won't get hi by a nade.
<superretroworld> what episode was that?
<RAWRity> because, you know, it's not like watching MLP clips with music played over them would get boring after an hour.
<Vordox> Rule nr 2 = Have Spears
<otakon> superretroworld: two
<Cloud> nope...i think my roommate has a idea but i doubt he understands
<SolairePony89> superretroworld: Episode 2
<Vordox> Rule 3 = Muffins

<sonicandmario85> *kills gilda instead* :3

<Ninjazz> Better than arrows.
<SirGanjalf> Spears is an inglorious bastard
<operatorPony> is there anyway we can have sheduled showings during the week?
<hen3ry> which is not matching reality, at least WW1. I remember my great grandfather telling me of winter in the trenches, the soldiers took the day off, shared smokes and booze.
*Quick_Thinker clestia TELLS sonicandmario85 NOT TO TRY ANYTHING FUNNY
<VenHur96> Then...who tooks the bullet?
<OohShiny> spears gonna die anyway
<Sumica> 00,10nope
<Spriggals> ^
<flutter_spin> I kind of like the random showings of the week
<flutter_spin> Keeps it a surprise
<RainBowJack> that sounds so wrong Weapons on me
<sonicandmario85> I was a solider like you.Then i took a bullet to the knee
<OohShiny> nice fields
<OohShiny> FUS RO DAH!
<RAWRity> see, this is cool and all, but I feel like them just interviewing the actual veterans would make for a more engaging show.
<Barbetos> no.jpg
<SirGanjalf> hen3ry: WWI was kinda different, with the trenches at other stuff
<GarrettBrony> it suck if you were a private in the military and your last name was Parts
<Sumica> 00,10more of we all have reallife things we do outside of bronystate
<flutter_spin> lol. I kind of agree RAWRity
<hen3ry> SirGanjalf: true
<Xaiden> hey who's the pony on the bottom left of the screen supposed to be?
<Quick_Thinker> OC
<flutter_spin> Sumica, Xaiden
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Hey admins! how do i subscribe to the newsletter?
<operatorPony> RAWRity: Thats what History Channel is for.. and they did it
<OohShiny> YAY!
<operatorPony> Big_Macintosh_1992: Email someone :D
<OohShiny> It's a trap!
<Flaron> ITS A TARP!!!
<operatorPony> I think it is under the FAQ
<flutter_spin> Xaiden: http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/Sumica-273432110 for reference
<Quick_Thinker> THE GERMANS HAVE A GODDAMN PLANNNNNNNNN
<OohShiny> die you capitalist scum
<RAWRity> WWI was a much more straighforward war: send wave after wave of men and throw poison gas and bombs at eachother until somebody wins. Planes and tanks and the like weren't advanced enough for any serious damage like they were in WWII
<Flaron> werent theyu japanese?
<Xaiden> FUCKING GERMANS
<Flaron> whatever
<Flaron> history sucks
<superretroworld> thats it
<hen3ry> There weren't a lot of Japanese troops in France.
<OohShiny> just watching for the war scenes
<RAWRity> Flaron: the Japanese offensive was mostly navy.
<operatorPony> RAWRity: WWI was about territory so much
<OohShiny> I don't even care for the plot
<OohShiny> sorry
<sonicandmario85> *
<Cloud> RAWRity: their were tanks just not very common
<Flaron> thanks "RAWRity"
<operatorPony> RAWRity: sacrifice thousands of men for a couple of yards of land
<Xaiden> oh hey doesn't a FF kill happen in a minute
<sonicandmario85> *gives derpy a muffin and celestia sees*:3
<RAWRity> Flaron: why the qote.
<OohShiny> I like trains
<RAWRity> quotes*
<Flaron> meh, just felt like it
<superretroworld> OohShiny: so does sheldon
<RAWRity> operatorPony: more or less, yeah. Only to lose those few yards the next day.
<Flaron> I liek trains 2OO!
<JESmith71> What's this? We seeing a random unannounced movie?
<GarrettBrony> 2OO
<RAWRity> there IS a reason WWI was originally called "The war to end all wars"
<OohShiny> [][ooo][ooo] choo choo
<operatorPony> RAWRity: Sabaton "Price of a Mile"
*Quick_Thinker sonicandmario85 someone already took derpy away
<Rain> problem is, RAWRity, WWII
<OohShiny> let's play a game
<hen3ry> At the time it was called The Great War.
<sonicandmario85> i meant the adult derpy XD
<OohShiny> *jigsaw's mask*
<superretroworld> RAWRity: unless there are no more ppl in the world, einstein said 'as long as theres men there will be wars
<sonicandmario85> not the filly derpy
<OohShiny> I like games
<Quick_Thinker> all thats left is : clestia (surprised no pony had the guts to try and take her)
<RAWRity> Rain: oh, I know, but at the time it was easily the most savage war anybody had seen. They kind of thought that this one would...scare us off of doing it again.
<Rain> lol
<JESmith71> It reminds me of that MAD FiM parody of War Horse. Fluttershy: "This is really called the Great War, but we're calling it WWI so we don't confuse the audience!"
<Vordox> RAWRity: Then hitlet, then USA USA USA USA USA
<Rain> we are too head strong for that
<RAWRity> Little did they know: we'd eventually put sanctions onto Germany that would lead to Hitler's rise to power in germany
<sonicandmario85> quick its spelled celestia not clestia :P
<RAWRity> and then, after WWII, we placed MORE sanctions on germany...which led to the cold war.
<Quick_Thinker> snoring wil get you killed private
<hen3ry> well, that, and we let the German Army return under circumstances where they could lie to themselves and say "our leaders sold us out" rather than "we got our butts kicked"
<OohShiny> he killed a sergeant
<RAWRity> Which by proxy led to the taliban gaining power in Afghanistan.
<GarrettBrony> anypony read of watched All quiet of the western front?
<Rain> did he stab him?
<superretroworld> poor guy
<Spriggals> Yes
<SirGanjalf> At least WWI wasn't as harsh to civilians as WWII; with deatch camps, carpet bombings and penal batallions raping, murdering and pillaging everything on their way
<Rain> ah
<RaveBrony> Damn....
<Quick_Thinker> god damnit and this is why you dont jump to conclusions
<operatorPony> "He looked liek aKraut"... Everyone looked a like. Thats why the Pacific theatre was so much more.. dehumanized
<RAWRity> Which led to the whole issue in the middle east we've been dealing with for 11 years now.
<Spriggals> Where is this going RAWRirty?
<OohShiny> stop talking about history
<OohShiny> god
<Vordox> ded
<GarrettBrony> RAWRity Though it was 20 years if you count Kuwait
<OohShiny> it's a trap!
<OohShiny> don't go soldier
<RAWRity> so yeah, because Archduke Ferdinand couldn't take a bullet, 9/11 happened.
<Rain> OohShiny, what's wrong? dont like learning from the past?
<SirGanjalf> Flash! Gordon!
<sonicandmario85> DONT CHEW MY ASS BOY Son:BUT IT TASTE SO GOOD DAD
<Flaron> history hurts my ideas :P
<operatorPony> lol
<OtakuTom> Flash! I'm a mac, I'm not compatible!
<OohShiny> Rain, nah, it's all in the past
<RaveBrony> Hehe
<RAWRity> ARCHDUKE FERDINAND WAS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND 9/11.
<OohShiny> what I care is the present and future
<SirGanjalf> OtakuTom: Well, that's a bummer *shot*
<Rain> but if you dont learn from the past, you are doomed to repeat it, OohShiny >3>
<Quick_Thinker> ok the checklist for fillys left: dr.hooves (nvm he used the TARDIS and left) cranky doodle, Candice, Shining armor, Spike
<RAWRity> OohShiny: ah, but you forget: those that do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.

<sonicandmario85> why does it have to be low quality?
<SirGanjalf> otakon: If it doesn't move, shoot it in the head to be sure.

<Sumica> 00,10nah it was just realy soft dirt he's fine
<Kimori> wanted to ask how you were able to get here from your smart phone
<Flaron> WOOOHEEEE
<RAWRity> Funfact: the telltale "clang" of an empty gun began to become synonymous in the battle field with a sitting/open target, and a chance for the enemy to shoot. Soldiers began to use this to their advantage, by firing a few rounds off, then clicking a shell against their helmet. Thus, the enemy would think they were out of ammo, come out to shoot, and get caught unawares.
<Vordox> lol Mica
<adasdad> kill streak! call in a helicopter!
<Rainfall_Night> epic
