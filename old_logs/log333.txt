<Yahooz> Ohey OneTrickPony, do you have one song?

<ScootaChicken> why do so many people hate country ;___;
<Roxsnow> I don't mind country actually.
<SkilledSkillet> I dont hate it
<Fazana> I have nothing agaisn't country.
<Midnight_Tempest> because its boring
<derpsalot> becuase its annoying
<Fazana> Though I like classical
<OneTrickPony> I'm sorry to say,but it is boring like trance
<ScootaChicken> Its not my favourite genre of music but there are a fair few good songs
*Luna is listening 60's music
<BlueSpirit> because they don't know new country
<VioletVanilla> 06classical <3
<xcanox> ScootaChicken: Because rock 'n roll > country.
<Yahooz> because Luna loves classical
<Midnight_Tempest> the only country music i will listen to is Johnny Cash
<VioletVanilla> 06inb4 I play all country from now on
<Yahooz> XD
<VioletVanilla> 06c;
<Jim> It really depends on what kind of country it is
<ScootaChicken> thats a given xcanox
<Yahooz> c:
<Fazana> Play some classical :3
<Shizuka> 13oh my
<OneTrickPony> cause 70's rock that's why
<LunaTheBeloved> Country is alright.
<Yahooz> Wubstep?
<Midnight_Tempest> but yes classical is great music
<xcanox> OneTrickPony: '60s > '70s
<BlueSpirit> Metal is best music
<ScootaChicken> CCR ftw
<SkilledSkillet> Megaman?
<xcanox> CCR ftw indeed.
<Fazana> Yup
<Yahooz> Dat megaman remix
<Globetrotter> Guys, pick a pony.
<OneTrickPony> hmm 60's is okay

<RawketLawnchair> Iiiii am megaman, and here is my plan.
<Nyria> I love Old music "Put on your sunday clothes there's lots of world out there~!"
<Globetrotter> Go!
<Fazana> Um...
<LunaTheBeloved> 80's-90's is best
<Fazana> Megapony

<Yahooz> Dat rap
<xcanox> CCR/Golliwogs

<Fazana> What do you mean Megapony doesn't exist?
<Phase4> should i play megaman?
<Fazana> Yes.
<derpsalot> cracker?

<ScootaChicken> the 60s was best musical decade
<SkilledSkillet> Of course
<Fazana> Then quake afterwards

<BlueSpirit> megaman? boooring
<ScootaChicken> the 80s was pretty dire

<SkilledSkillet> Im 14
<Midnight_Tempest> they never checked my ID
*Phase4 had some hard cider when he was 16, didnt like it
<OneTrickPony> -_-
<Yahooz> inb4 people shamelssly say their age
<LadyCanary> I've never had beer, though I've had a bit of wine, wasnt too fond of it.
<DB_Brony> SkilledSkillet: Same here
<Phase4> Yahooz: you meen like this 18?
<Dumori> Phase4 I'm English the only cider is hard cider :p and I do like it
<OneTrickPony> *facepalms*
<Phase4> Dumori: same here in aus
<Midnight_Tempest> booze is one of those things you wont like at first, but the taste gets better everytime you try it
<Phase4> Dumori: we call soft cider apple juice
<Yahooz> You need to have beer before you can apreciate wine LadyCanary, because after you've had beer, wine actually tastes good by comparison :p
*Fleur was 8 and accidentally drank some hard alchohol thinking it was chocolate milk
<SkilledSkillet> when my friends got drunk for some reason they kept laughing about the name mary loo retin
<Dumori> yup
*Fleur has never gone near the stuff afain
<Phase4> Fleur: whoops
<Fleur> again
<Dumori> you can get it filltered or not
<LadyCanary> ...Awwwww Fleur D:
*OneTrickPony dances
<Phase4> that would have been painfull for an 8 year old
<Fleur> It was
<Yahooz> Indeed
<VioletVanilla> 06Yahooz: I only drink wein anyhow. .
*VioletVanilla would dance if she was not sick in bed. .
<RaveBrony> Pshh, my father gave me a margarita at Olive Garden when i was 9 -_-
<LadyCanary> Well, when I CAN actually drink I'll have a little bit, but I sure as heck wont go overboard
<LadyCanary> And NUUU Viii D:
<Fleur> and lets just say that I didnt hold down dinner that night :\
<RaveBrony> Thought it was funny
<Dumori> I drink mostly spirits and beers and ciders
<Yahooz> Well... ... idk -_-
<Dumori> oh and wine
<Yahooz> some people just have different taste buds
<OneTrickPony> rum is good
<RaveBrony> Ponies like cider
<Dumori> but furit based drinks get me weirdly drunk in ways sprits don't
<Midnight_Tempest> i will drink ANY alcohol put in front of me... even Everclear
<Fleur> I eat orange peels ^_^
<RaveBrony> lol

<DB_Brony> "is there any way to fix a broken heart" is such a great quote to use at times
<OneTrickPony> Eurobeat is #3 on my favorite songs
<Midnight_Tempest> what Fleur said
<NullRadix> Phase4: I think I had a laptop with that many fake Network Adapters
<Starflash> Fleur I'm liking this idea!
<Phase4> NullRadix: whatever for?
<Fleur> and seeing as some of us dont drink, that may take a while! :D
<NullRadix> something to due with setting up VPN's. Some amount of poor programming was probably involved as well

<conyst> Flee Now Before its to late
<Unicorn_Gundam> It's a zombie
<Shizuka> 13he looks like brad pitt
<Shizuka> 13this light, this angle, brad pitt
<JamesIsABrony> why did zombie tacos just pop into my head?
<Phase4> "what kind of object" "some kind of large object"
<Cypresswolf> aww...not the episode I thougt it was...cant remember this one
<SkilledSkillet> It's a ghost! Plot twist!
<OrangeJuicePony> Its the Loche nes monster
<Unicorn_Gundam> a submarine full of zombies, maybe?
<fillyfillyy> im back
<Shizuka> 13possible submarine
<conyst> Its the Kraken
<EmeraldChocolate> HI fillyfillyy

*Nittany_Discord 11,01takes Shizuka to funky creepytown.
<SkilledSkillet> The tapping is me I'm hitting my head on the wall
<NullRadix> I think I can conclude that running is an effective anti-depressent
<Shizuka> 13now in this light... the guy looks like a cross between george clooney and brad pitt
<OrangeJuicePony> well duh its underwater whos gonna hear it ring?
<CupcakeWarrior> DERPY!
<Shizuka> 13a watched noise never pings
<Unicorn_Gundam> So, it's Derpy?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If that was a sub, they would have been dead.
<Unicorn_Gundam> Makes sense

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Either torpedoed or collided with the object.
<Shizuka> 13turns out the clanging is just their flagpole

<OrangeJuicePony> oh noes Google chrome crashed

Ancient Greeks were happy if they belonged to the 5% known as "The Free Man". In the middle ages, people were happy when they got a little farm and shat outside in a hole. Later people were happy when they got to have more than 2 changes of clothes. Now people are happy when they don't have to open angry "Pay us" letter
<Dalekkahn> that*
<Ictiv> Woah

<NullRadix> aha... but do you see what I see? I have a case of what I've dubbed 'epicitus', or the desire for things to be greater than they currently are. I see a great fandom, powerful, but still inherently divided. I see potential, but don't know how to harvest that potential, especially in a way that would resist corruption.
<Corrupt> something random http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYNHDMXuuAQ

<Cypresswolf> This video reminds me of a movie where a traveling salesmen and a young lady travel from town to town selling fake Bibles - sound familiar to anyone?
<NullRadix> As a short, I kinda liked this explanation... FO:E = normal mode, FO:E - Pinkeyes = easy mode. FO:E - Project Horizons = hard mode
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: no, +n prevents that
<NullRadix> but like I said, busy

<SkilledSkillet> Want to know how to sound like rarity? say simply and then a high class adjective
<Nyria> weird*
<Shizuka> 13as for the rest of our modes, +J prevents autorejoin after a kick, +j 5:1 prevents more than 5 joins in 1 second, +K prevents repeat messages (whitespace and colors stripped), +P means we're a permanent channel, and +L gives us a longer ban list

<Quin> Rarity is best hat maker
<JTDrift> when did Indy get raep? I know not what you speak of. :|
<Artemis> And SilverSonic, it's hard, but sometimes you just have to find something to keep you out of it
<RawketLawnchair> I would love for Rarity to make me a fancy hat.
<Drake> 04It's going to sound like the sappiest thing to ever come out of a Disney movie, but you need to think happy thoughts.
<Cavy> I just forgot who I was speaking to a moment ago...
<Cavy> Wow.
<SilverSonic> i try my best to find something, but something always pulls me back in
*Nyria will find more hats~
<MakerDusk> Quin: never use the word "maker" in vain
<Drake> 04Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.
<SilverSonic> because i seem to mess SOMETHING up EVERY FUCKING TIME
<Dismo> Nice, this seems to be the same chatprogram as Dopelives.
