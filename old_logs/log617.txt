<DeadpoolDash> Tali never asked to be an admiral and then she took a thermal clip to the knee.
<luna_pony> dude thats been overused
<Pinkie_Brony> Well, I took a mace to the face.. :P it hurt..
<flutterchu> my brother says my nickname suck he says it's the worst crossover ever

<Buytoast> you remind me of CWC's creation
<Gold_Demona> lol
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Do you play multiplayer at all by any chance?
<DeadpoolDash> shepard could pretty much buy every female quarian Tali's suit and be happy with any of them
<MASF123|Disconnected> Pinkie_Brony yeah but I spawned later so it was ok.
<Gold_Demona> Yay~
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Well theres like 1-2-3 new multiplayer DLC's you can get

<Pinkie_Brony> Thats the worst storm there is..
<killerpony7733> Sumica: I like how you use the exact same team setup as me, Tali+Garrus is just a combo that's pretty good
<flutterchu> im just glad i dont have call of duty i think everyone would think im weierd since my words are diffrent when i say them and i dont fell in correct fit to reavel my age
<DeadpoolDash> hunt for red october joke

<flutterchu> 1 to 5 kids are born and 1 to 2 people die every second
<Gold_Demona> lol Turian chocolate
<DeadpoolDash> the cat fight between ash and tali is classic
<Pinkie_Brony> Their suits somewhat remind me of Dead Space..
<Pinkie_Brony> The zero gravity is even reminding me of it
<DeadpoolDash> ME came out before Dead Space
<killerpony7733> ^
<killerpony7733> And dead space has so many jump scares
<flutterchu> this website would help http://www.breathingearth.net/

<flutterchu> i beleve people are thinking i dont know how to reply but i do i just dont know the streamer's name
<Phase4> 00,02biotics > guns
<DeadpoolDash> indeed
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Soldier>biotics
<Phase4> 00,02why do geth have terminals on their ship?
<killerpony7733> Cause i don't need powers i only need guns
<Phase4> 00,02i meen they're all computers
<DeadpoolDash> guns run out of ammo
<Phase4> 00,02they can talk to their ship directly
<Phase4> 00,02why even have crew space
<killerpony7733> DeadpoolDash: Good thing a soldier can carry all type of weapons and have a surplus of ammo every mission
<Buytoast> maintenance
<DeadpoolDash> perhaps it is a relic of quarian programing
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, its explained im me2, they all talk wirelessly
<Phase4> 00,02infact its explained in 1 iirc
<Phase4> 00,02ded
<DeadpoolDash> guns suck
<Phase4> 00,02imagine how much faster their ships could be if they didnt have to carry all this crap around
<killerpony7733> I think weight has no matter in how fast the ships go
<Gold_Demona> Fights like these were why I gave my Shep Overload.
<flutterchu> mister streamer is this game long like kingdom hearts i heard some people on my street talking saying kingdom hearts is to long then they looked at me and the a started running from them chasing me just because i was listening
<killerpony7733> Look at the reapers, They got the most powerful mass effect engines
<killerpony7733> And they are over a kilometer long
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu Kingdom Hearts is not long. It's average
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: well that's what you get for listening
<Gold_Demona> huh?
<DeadpoolDash> do you have them set to auto use powers?
<DeadpoolDash> weird
<DeadpoolDash> they usually spam powers on that setting
<DeadpoolDash> stange
<DeadpoolDash> strange
<MASF123|Disconnected> weird
<DeadpoolDash> we could upload a virus
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02what?
<Phase4> 00,02fires in space

<Rustymeat> to the mooooooooooooonnn
<Magical_Pablez94> Oh come on Sumica don't ban people like that.. :D
<Gold_Demona> Wrek would've banned harder
<DeadpoolDash> sumica is secretly celestia with a bag of bananas
<Magical_Pablez94> Deadpool|Dash lol!!
<Magical_Pablez94> <.< >.> nick fail.
<DeadpoolDash> run fast
<Gold_Demona> Ruuuuuuuuun!
<Magical_Pablez94> ...
<Golakka> Whey-up!
*Magical_Pablez94 runs panicking.
<DeadpoolDash> I'm surprised Tali didnt get her ass caught in it
<Golakka> Good morning everybody! how are we?
<Spanner_Pony> Sleepy
<DeadpoolDash> there used to be a gliche on this level where if you are scoped you are immune to the blue space magic
<Golakka> Blue space magic?
<DeadpoolDash> the blue crap coming at him
<Golakka> what does it do?
<Spanner_Pony> I think its an EMP
<Golakka> shitled wipe?
<Golakka> shield even
<DeadpoolDash> take away shields/barrier
<Gold_Demona> biotic powers = space magic
<Golakka> that crap doesnt look like biotics tbh
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02are the geth using biotics
<Golakka> ^
<DeadpoolDash> tech is almost the same as biotics
<Phase4> 00,02whats that thing that flys by every now andagain
<Spanner_Pony> Electro Magnetic Pulse!
<DeadpoolDash> tech burst-biotic explosion
<Golakka> looks like they are entering the warp :D
<MASF123|Disconnected> WTF
<Golakka> WAIT
<Golakka> An electromagnetic CANNON?
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<MadSurge> Oh wow, Sumica's on FIYAH today! Mass Effect 3 all day!
<Golakka> the shielding must be really heavy :D
<Spanner_Pony> as such "one big gun"
<Phase4> 00,02gauss cannon
<DeadpoolDash> gauss or rail
<Phase4> 00,02little slow
<Golakka> Hmm, So its a gauss/railgun, not an EMP cannon
<Phase4> 00,02DeadpoolDash, theres a difference betwene the two :P
<Golakka> thats more sensible
<Golakka> not much Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02gauss cannons use electromagnets, railguns actually use two rails
<Phase4> 00,02essentialy the same thing, magnetic acceleration, different methods
<Golakka> Railguns pass an electrical charge down two rails, Gauss guns use a series of magnets
<DeadpoolDash> yep
<Golakka> You can make a gauss gun with a few bits of wood and a ball magnet
<Golakka> railguns are more complex however :D
<DeadpoolDash> she wants shepard penis
<DeadpoolDash> indeed
<Spanner_Pony> noooooooooooooo
<Golakka> PLOT TWIST!!!
<DeadpoolDash> Legion: Shepard, I am your Father. Shepard: No, thats not true, thats impossible!

<Gold_Demona> Got my face in my other computer. Fiddling with my desktop pony. =P
<Kandarihu> Hmm, Discord is a Draconequis, or whatever. A hybrid pony/dragon. If Rarity were to ever accept Spike's affections, another Draconequis would be born from this.
<Sumica> 00,10I kinda like the fandoms version of their kid
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Magical_Pablez94> .......chat. Dead. Now.
<Gold_Demona> R.I.P. chat

<Gold_Demona> lol pie flavor

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Me too. I'm just saying it's really random and genetics are super flexible. =P
<Sumica> 00,10this is what it would look like if I just streamed directly from my capture gear with out using compresion
<MadSurge> Pinkie would say "screw gravity" :D
<Kiryu> oh great I got frozen up

<Cypresswolf> movie night?....*several seconds later*...Oh, its friday
<tSparx|Reading> XAX It's a mystery
<XAX> ._.
<Kandarihu> Sumica, are we even HAVING BMN this weekend?
<eosforos> ;o
<Sumica> 00,10yes
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: darn it, wanted something familar after the horse apples i had to deal with yesterday
<Kiryu> Oh someone kill me and put me out of my slow internet misery
<Kandarihu> So what are we watching tonight, then?
<XAX> ^
*tSparx|Reading glomps Kiryu instead of killing him.
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Surprise as sumi told ya
<Cypresswolf> I'm slow today...drained from yesterday - OSHA seminar was a nightmare...and got even worse on the way home.
<killerpony7733> :D
*PinkieSpice feeds kiryu a supisous cupcake
<Sumica> 00,10as I said, it's a mystery
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: sounds like a hard day
<eosforos> wat we watchin? ;o
<Kiryu> Hmmmm glomp or cupcake
<Cypresswolf> I'm never doing anything involving downtown Houston again
<tSparx|Reading> Why is the audio on this louder for music and almost silent for dialogue?
<MadSurge> eosforos: episodes with bgm enhanced
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: i hope its something the hopsital internet moderatiots won't mine XD
<Kandarihu> killerpony7733, so Sumica said it's going to be a surprise?
<tSparx|Reading> MadSurge: Oh you answered my q
<MadSurge> tSparx|Reading: that's the point, more bgm
<eosforos> MadSurge: hm ye.. but why xd?
<tSparx|Reading> eosforos: Why not?
<Kiryu> wait show it again my player laged! D:
<MadSurge> eosforos: because bgm is awesome!
<eosforos> tSparx|Reading: dk ;o nvm
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Pretty much. No one knows what's going to be on movie night, Mods will be surprising us
<tSparx|Reading> eosforos: There is some incredible music in the show that we don't notice because it works well as BGM
<Sumica> 00,10we have seen all the eps so many times normaly
<Sumica> 00,10the BGM needs more love
<MadSurge> Dat sweat
<Cypresswolf> Question - is it a common occurance for city drivers to honk at the person in front of you at a red light, because you didnt have enough space to get all the way in the lane?
<Sumica> 00,10because they do a great job on it and it goes mostly unnoticed
<Kiryu> god now I see why people hate modems
<tSparx|Reading> ^^das^^
<eosforos> tSparx|Reading: ah.. right... how didnt i think about it.. :D
<Sumica> 00,10I have them honk for not turning left on a red arrow Cypresswolf
<Sumica> 00,10morening Scoot-Scootaloo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Am I.. deaf?
<Cypresswolf> Sumica: I got that quite a bit, even out in the sticks
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And mornin'!
<MadSurge> Hey Scoot-Scootaloo! nope, only bgm episodes
<Kandarihu> I swear, I'm not being sarcastic when I say this. But that clears up a lot of uncertainty over this issue. Just getting official word that it's supposed to be a surprise makes it better.
<Gold_Demona> Cypresswolf: only if the driver in front has room to move forward to let the driver behind get into the lane.
*Bronysith licks Sumica and Scoot-Scootaloo
<eosforos> lolgod
<Sumica> 00,10deaf dumb and blind

<eosforos> lol
*Bronysith hugs Sumica back
<MadSurge> My, the chat got lively again!
<MadSurge> Dat apt yay
<Cypresswolf> Gold_Demona: I didnt have more than a foot or two, but that didnt stop the .... behind me from honking - then looking like a bigger idiot when he couldnt move up anyway :)
<Bronysith> ugh
<Bronysith> have to use the bathroom
<Bronysith> this is exactlyh what i get for having taco bell for breakfast
<eosforos> baAaAaAm
<Gold_Demona> Cypresswolf: Yeah, you get folks like that a lot, especially in higher populated areas. :P
<Sumica> 00,10poor AJ
<Sumica> 00,10also why is pinkie leaving?
<Sumica> 00,10dont she live there?
<Kiryu> sumica try and put ''PILLS HERE'' when twilight gets the pill alright? :D
<Cypresswolf> Pinkie is going to stop Mr. Cake from throwing out all the sugary confections
<Kandarihu> Sumica, I think she has her own house, and she only works there.
<Sumica> 00,10could be.
<Sumica> 00,10but i always figured she lived with the cakes seeing as she had her own room there in party of one
<Cypresswolf> Pheonix are quite sensative to temperatures
<Kandarihu> I'll have to look at that again. And unfortunately, PSO2 uses Gameguard, and Gameguard hates MPCHC
<Sumica> 00,10ewww they are still using gameguard
<Cypresswolf> :3 FS: Take this pill - Philomena: I'm not swallowing that - FS: well then Good News, its a suppository
<Kandarihu> Sumica, yeah.
<Sumica> 00,10figured they would have learned seeing as how easly it failed last time
<Bronysith> HE PUKED IN FLUTTERSHYS FACE
<Kandarihu> Sumica, really? What happened?
<Bronysith> HE MUST DIE
<Sumica> 00,10item dupeing everywhere
<Bronysith> well
<Bronysith> im off to Dark Souls
<Sumica> 00,10it killed PC/ps2 version of PSU
<Kandarihu> Oh, I heard about that happening on the GCN version of PSO Ep1&2
<Bronysith> PSO2 is going to be gewd
<Cypresswolf> Spongebird
<XAX> Sumica: Gameguard has been proven to be almost a virus. To name a few of the features of gameguard, it can record keystrokes, stop processes,
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<XAX> and other stuff I can't remember.
<Cypresswolf> STOP Youve - oh, its only Twilight
<MadSurge> Haha Bronysith, enjoying your Dark Souls?
<Sumica> 00,10it alays pitched a bitch when I used voice overlay
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, I'm playing the Japanese version right now. It is pretty cool.
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: tell me all about it later please
<Bronysith> MadSurge: yes, now to get raped in the butt by zombies
<Kandarihu> Alright
<Bronysith> then ill become better and become the rapist
<Sumica> 00,10tisk tisk Bronysith
<MadSurge> Bronysith: ikr
<Bronysith> ...

<Sumica> 00,10twi you so nurotic
*Tarku hugs everypony :3
<Kiryu> PILLS HERE!
*AdamTheDuck hugs Tarku :P
<Cypresswolf> If Twilight thinks Celestia would throw a pony in the dungeon for something as slight as taking her pet pheonix, She's seen things
<Kiryu> darn too early
<XAX> Cypresswolf: She's seen some sh!t.

<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh well. Back to making an imageboard.
<Kiryu> I love her voice in pokemon bridged xD
<Kandarihu> Is there still a debate over Vinyl Scratch's eye color?
<Kammerjunk> spitfirecolt2: You can never have too much swag.
<MASF123|Disconnected> swag is much needed how does your friend not understand?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Magenta, canon has renderd this the unarguable truth.
<spitfirecolt2> thats right all i buy is pony swag
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Oh, you know the Internet. Argues over everything.
<Kammerjunk> No matter how stupid.
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, yeah. Point taken.
<spitfirecolt2> still waiting on my nmm collection still on backorder
<Kammerjunk> I need pony shoes.
<Kammerjunk> No, I don't mean hoof-themed.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Funny
<DoctoDoctorWho> haha
<Spell-of-Gaming> My webhost doesn't seem to have permissions
<Kiryu> Im starting to remember the comercial that apeared in the credits of my little pony ''secret but fun'' :D
<Kammerjunk> Secret butt fun!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03To entertain you ponies, I'll just let my OMFG playlist run until I finish a super secret project
<DoctoDoctorWho> I might be getting a titanium spork and an RD t-shirt this coming B-day :)
<MadSurge> Scoot-Scootaloo: Ooooh mystery :D
<Gold_Demona> Ooh~ Super secret project. =D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I should probably turn that of...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03off*
<MadSurge> :D
<Kiryu> super secret project is secret
<Kammerjunk> That is totally Scoots' ping sound.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Super secret
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hmmmmmm
<Kammerjunk> I like secret.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: yes it is :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03For the record, Nowacking made that ping for me. She's a pretty cool girl!
<Kiryu> I knew it was nowacking! :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hah, my file manager shortens "Permissions" to "Perms"
<spitfirecolt2> i really wish we could get a vinyl and tavi episode
<DoctoDoctorWho> one can program different sounds for their ping?
<tSparx|Reading> DoctoDoctorWho: A lot of us don't use the embedded client
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Probably should have made it louder...
<tSparx|Reading> DoctoDoctorWho: And usually changing it on a non-embedded client is usually easy
<Kammerjunk> Well, I didn't give mIRC a custom ping sound. I just changed my Windows sound used for the default ping.
<Kammerjunk> So now I hear "yay".
<DoctoDoctorWho> sweet, once I find out how Im totally changing mine to the sonic the hedgehog ring sound effect:D
<tSparx|Reading> Kammerjunk: Oh well yeah that works too haha, but I'm not sure I wanna hear Pinkie Scream every time I cause windows to beep
<Kammerjunk> tSparx|Reading: It wasn't really intentional, it just kinda happened.
<DoctoDoctorWho> as discord would say, priceless!
<Kiryu> so can we see some vids? :$
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: that must be confusing during Sumica's streams
<Kammerjunk> It does.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Not yet
<Kammerjunk> So I might change it to Luna's "ha ha!"
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Until I'm done with my "super secret thing"
<Kiryu> the fun has been doubled?
<Phase4> 00,02getting lotsa buffer here
<Kiryu> I know that feel bro
<AdamTheDuck> Running smooth for me Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02strange
<AdamTheDuck> Scoot's just streaming songs anyway
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You an your other side of the world-ish internet :p
<Spell-of-Gaming> What do the permission numbers "777" mean? :P
<tSparx|Reading> Phase4: Fine for me too
<AdamTheDuck> Lucky 7
<DoctoDoctorWho> Scoot-Scootaloo: have I ever told you that along with saturn you are my fav mod?
<tSparx|Reading> Spell-of-Gaming: In UNIX/Linux?
<Kiryu> how bout some gypsy bard?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I just do what I can :)
<Phase4> 00,02seems to fix itself when i refresh
<MASF123|Disconnected> I'd love that
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, everyone can read/write and execute
<Kiryu> :O
<MASF123|Disconnected> I can't
<AdamTheDuck> Yay Twilight theme
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ah, thank you, Phase4. I was thinking it was that.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm making an image board. :P
<Kiryu> :) Twilight aproves of this
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, its octal, bit order is rwx, numbers are for owner/group/other
<tSparx|Reading> AdamTheDuck: I thought the Twilight theme was "Supermassive Black Hole"
<MadSurge> HAHAHA, HEARD THIS LIVE :$
<tSparx|Reading> But anyway <3 <3 <3
<Spell-of-Gaming> How about "644"?
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Reading: there's a song called that?
<Kiryu> I wonder if there's transformations in fighting is magic twilight could go rapidash :P
<tSparx|Reading> DoctoDoctorWho: Yep. It's by Muse, and while it is used in Twilight, that doesn't matter. I really, really like it, even though it's not exactly the prog music I often listen to.
<AdamTheDuck> tSparx|Reading: Oh God really? Twilight OST?
<DoctoDoctorWho> hmmm, gotta look that up sometime
<Shortcircuit42> or just get their albums
<MASF123|Disconnected> Is tea good for the soul?
<AdamTheDuck> DOUBLE RAINBOOOOOOWSSSSSSS
<Kiryu> double rainbow dash ALL THE WAY!
<tSparx|Reading> AdamTheDuck: Well, OST would suggest that Supermassive Black Hole was written for Twlight, but the song came out months before the movie it was used in.
<Kiryu> :D :D
<Shortcircuit42> tSparx|Reading: well twilight IS a supermassive black hole
<tSparx|Reading> AdamTheDuck: As it turns out, Stephanie Meyer is (weirdly) a huge Muse fan, so she asked if she could use their song in her movie.
<tSparx|Reading> I really, really like Muse, worth checking out
<Kiryu> hey i herd about a remix of the mlp theme glitch something ummm whats it called?
<MASF123|Disconnected> MLP Theme Glitch by Alex S.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Then it's not really an Original Soundtrack.
<Kiryu> oh thanks and whats the name of this mix by the way?
<DoctoDoctorWho> I can totally see twilight running a university for unicorn mages in the future,
<tSparx|Reading> Spell-of-Gaming: Preciesly
<tSparx|Reading> DoctoDoctorWho: Dumblesparx
<MASF123|Disconnected> What will Twi do in the future?
<AdamTheDuck> Kiryu: Search for Ballad of the Brony and check out the credit song, it will have it there.
<AdamTheDuck> dman chat derped
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Reading: suck it hogwarts!
<Kiryu> Is that miachel jackson! 6_9
<Kiryu> well not this one the last one
<tSparx|Reading> Twilight will go on to be the Merlin of Equestria (she's only a young lady and she already kicks so much magical flank it's ridiculous).
<tSparx|Reading> Not that I'm biased or anything :P
<AdamTheDuck> Kiryu: Think that was "The Offspring"
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dumbledoor translated into different languages can literally mean "The door is dumb".
<Kiryu> trust me you dont want to know what harry potter means
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Reading: I want to think that she will reactivate magical talent in equestria, making a "order of high mages" style thing
<MASF123|Disconnected> Harry Potthead?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hairy pots?
<Gold_Demona> A potter is someone who makes pots, so I don't really see how that would translate bad. =P
<MASF123|Disconnected> She will be the next Starswirl the Bearded
<tSparx|Reading> DoctoDoctorWho: I could also see her essentially studying the limits of magic, seeing what she could do.
<Kiryu> Twilight... you are a wizard.
<MASF123|Disconnected> One does not simply watch one episode of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic.
<Kiryu> yeah trust me I tried big mistake
<MASF123|Disconnected> Twi's a wot?
<MASF123|Disconnected> Aye.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Twi's a book
<Kiryu> sweetie belle is a dictionary
<tSparx|Reading> MASF123|Disconnected: I saw the first half of the pilot a year before I started watching MLP. The friend who showed it to me later admitted she should've shown me the whole pilot xD
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Reading: little off topic, If starswirl was a powerful mage in his time, and the time spells are located in his section of the library, does that insinuate that he was a time mage?
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: I'm pretty sure he just experimented with time. Time can be a dangerous thing to tamper with.
<MASF123|Disconnected> There's a T-Shirt with Twilight loking pissed saying, "This book called Twilight, we must kill it."
<MASF123|Disconnected> I want that shirt.
<tSparx|Reading> DoctoDoctorWho: I assumed it meant that he was a studier and pioneer of temporal magic, whether that was all he did or not, or even if it's his specialty, I would've venture to guess.
<spitfirecolt2> i guess you could say that
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123|Disconnected: :D
<Kiryu> back to equestria dun dududud dun duuun
<spitfirecolt2> he was celestias advisor on magic
<tSparx|Reading> MASF123|Disconnected: I want that shirt too, haha
<Kandarihu> Seeing some Pinkie Pie Symbol Art in PSO2
<AJIsAwesome> Are they still making Phantasy Star games?
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, yes.
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: I have the perfect quote on why not to buck with time, brb while I find it
<Kiryu> so scoot's how is the project coming along?
<DoctoDoctorWho> ps this song sounds like something from kung fu panda
*tSparx|Reading turns back to her book
<tSparx|Reading> his*
<spitfirecolt2> i need a kindle fire for my fics
<DoctoDoctorWho> possible text wall inbound
<Kiryu> geting kinda bored from this music
<DoctoDoctorWho> You return home from your jolly time travel adventure in ancient Greece, having saved the world and being careful not to upset history and.. hold on a moment? Are those swastikas?! Hanging from the White House?! Looks like you've been hit by Godwin's Law of Time Travel. Talked to the wrong person? Nazi victory! Left technology back before the dinosaurs were wiped out? Nazi victory! Stepped on a bug? Nazi victory! Left a tap
<DoctoDoctorWho> yay time travel
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: :D
<Kiryu> you bastards you did it! you actually did it!
<AJIsAwesome> Kiryu: Did what?
<spitfirecolt2> wow time traveler is unpredictable and dangerous
<Kiryu> planet of the apes reference :$
<spitfirecolt2> orignals were better
<Kandarihu> Counseling a young Adolf Hitler to resist anti-semitism? Nazi Victory (although it would be a good thing in such a timeline)
<spitfirecolt2> where was buck at looking up plane ticket prices
<tSparx|Reading> T-Sparx proved that time travel can be unfun. Though it seems that in the MLP universe your free will is limited a bit if you go back in time; it seems amazing that Twilight would say the EXACT same thing she heard future-her say to her when she was future-her talking to past-her
<Kandarihu> Oh, wait. It still wouldn't be.
<SirGanjalf> DoctoDoctorWho: This reminds me of that adventure game i've been recently playing. (Killed the inventor of coathangers? Nazi victory!)
<Jmo> o.o
<Kiryu> stoping yourself from going back in time... NAZI VICTORY!
<spitfirecolt2> wow its a nazi victory no matter what
<DoctoDoctorWho> any fellow tropers among the brony community?
<spitfirecolt2> whats a troper
<AdamTheDuck> Think he means trooper.
<Kandarihu> I read TV Tropes from time to time. I don't do much editing, though.
<AJIsAwesome> spitfirecolt2: Trooper.
<DoctoDoctorWho> cause I got this from Godwins law of time travel
<Kiryu> kill the jews before nazis were invented... RACIST NAZI VICTORY!
<spitfirecolt2> nope
<Kandarihu> spitfirecolt2, AdamTheDuck, Troper refers to users of the wiki TV Tropes
<AdamTheDuck> Right.
<DoctoDoctorWho> thank you Kandarihu,
<SirGanjalf> Tvtropes? For the Love of Celestia; DON'T link it!
<Kiryu> dat whistle <3
<Kandarihu> SirGanjalf, I know. It's 99% text.
<DoctoDoctorWho> SirGanjalf: not even the dreaded evil overlord list?
<Spell-of-Gaming> TVTropes? Nononononono.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't want to be addicted to TVTropes again
<Kiryu> umm whats so bad about TVTropes?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Its about as addicting as bronystate, If not worse
<tSparx|Reading> Kiryu: It's easy to waste several hours there
<tSparx|Reading> Even more so than it is here
<Kiryu> is such a thing posible? 6_9
<tSparx|Reading> It's like reading Wikipedia aimlessly, except the articles about your favorite culture tropes
<tSparx|Reading> Kiryu: It's not just possible, it's real.
<SirGanjalf> Kiryu: It's like a black hole... or a Maze of the Internet: You go from one reference/trope to another, and another, and another, and another... Suddenly you realize it's Christmas already
<AdamTheDuck> Oh Tropes, I remember being on this site a while ago
<DoctoDoctorWho> By Celestia's name my boy, It's possible
<Kiryu> *puts on sunglasses then takes them off* mother of god.
<SpectraClouds> Does anypony know where to get the client for ponychat
<DoctoDoctorWho> *takes off sunglasses to reveal another pair of sunglasses* we are doomed,
<tSparx|Reading> SpectraClouds: You can go to any of the theatres on BronyState to use an embed client joined to this channel
<Kiryu> *takes the sunglasses from doctorwho and puts them on and then off* I agree
<tSparx|Reading> For other ponychat channels, idk if there are any embeds, but any third-party client (Chatzilla, mIRC, etc.) can attach to irc.ponychat.net
<SpectraClouds> ok thanks
<AdamTheDuck> Oohhhh... What's this band? :3
<SirGanjalf> Kiryu, DoctoDoctorWho: http://horobox.reager.org/u/Jojje_1341584044.gif
<Kiryu> bloody hell indeed
<DoctoDoctorWho> :D I've done that before, spongebob style,

<AdamTheDuck> Kiryu: Oh no that's not the song name
<Sumica> 00,10leave that one up to Scoot-Scootaloo, as it'
<AdamTheDuck> I just felt like writing the lyrics :P

<Kiryu> then what's the name of the song
<tSparx> Idk
<AdamTheDuck> Well I don't think anyone knows Kiryu
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hmmm... technically lazy stream is lazy, so I'll allow it just this once.

<DoctoDoctorWho> Scoot-Scootaloo: A thousand apologies my lord, It wont happen again. I swear.
<tSparx> So, joc, during a stream, posting links should be cleared with the streamer first?
<tSparx> DIS SONG <3
<Kiryu> oh my gosh I dint know! :O
<Kiryu> im sorry for the link :'(
<tSparx> Or is it just youtube/video links?
<MASF123|Disconnected> Any type of video link
<AdamTheDuck> Just non-image links
<DoctoDoctorWho> DEAD OR ALIVE!!!
<Kiryu> I only put a pic
<MASF123|Disconnected> was it a long link?
<tSparx> AdamTheDuck: So images = good. Else = ask the streamer, ask a mod, or just don't do it?
<AdamTheDuck> Kiryu: Don't worry, only non image links aren't allowed
<MASF123|Disconnected> Use derpy.me to shorten it
<AdamTheDuck> tSparx: Oh you can ask a mod.
<Kiryu> well that's a relief
<tSparx> AdamTheDuck: And that's during a stream?
<tSparx> AdamTheDuck: Or just in general?
<SpectraClouds> umm im not sure what im doing on this irc client is there anything or anywhere i can go to get help to connect with ponychat
<MASF123|Disconnected> only when a stream is up
<AdamTheDuck> tSparx: If no stream is happening then any links are allowed
<tSparx> Alright, phew, thanks all.
<Sumica> 00,10SpectraClouds yeah, #help
<tSparx> SpectraClouds: If you're running a third-party client
<DoctoDoctorWho> who first heard this song on the scooby doo movie?
<MASF123|Disconnected> Oh I see we have some newcomers here
<AdamTheDuck> tSparx: If there is a stream, whether the streamer is afk or not, no non-image links unless one has permission.
<tSparx> SpectraClouds: ie not the one embedded on bronystate
<Gold_Demona> I first heard this song on a Trigun AMV
<MASF123|Disconnected> What song is it?
<SpectraClouds> im using hydrairc
<tSparx> SpectraClouds: Then type in "/attach irc.ponychat.net" (without quotes), then "/join #BronyState" (again, no quotes)
<MASF123|Disconnected> My laptop is muted

<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh america

<Gold_Demona> MASF123|Disconnected: "I'm a cowboy... On a steel horse I ride... I'm wanted... Dead or alive~
<tSparx> We dissapoint ourselves too
<Gold_Demona> This accompaniment does not fit with this song...
<Gold_Demona> What? Why'd that other one take that to pop up? O_o
<Barbetos|AtWork> SO. Yesterday. New York. Celebration that the nation went a WEEK without a voilent shooting. This morning there is a voilent shooting in New York.
<Gold_Demona> that long*

<Yahooz> Mare-i-ka
<tSparx> Barbetos|AtWork: You know that if you adjust the statistics down to adjust for Europe's greater population, Europe has about 50 gun-related murders every year, America has over a thousand
<Yahooz> lameassponypuns
<DoctoDoctorWho> Yahooz: yes
<MASF123|Disconnected> How do you spell gone-or-re-yah?
<tSparx> gonorrhea?
<tSparx> yeah
<MASF123|Disconnected> ok
<AdamTheDuck> Fun fact: A linguist said that gonorrhea was one of the most soothing word phonetically. :D
<MASF123|Disconnected> Haha
<Alchemist> AdamTheDuck: and cellar door was the most beautiful combination of words
<AdamTheDuck> Gotta love studying linguistics. :P
<MASF123|Disconnected> I'm bilingual
<tSparx> Allistair Crowley is the template of names that most English-speaking people happen to respect the most
<tSparx> The same number of sylabbles and same pattern of emphasis
<tSparx> MASF123|Disconnected: English and?
<MASF123|Disconnected> Spanish
<DoctoDoctorWho> I plan on singing "flutterwonder" when I attend my first bronycon

<MASF123|Disconnected> Captain Friendship...he's a hero gonna stop hatred down to zero
<Vivix> MadSurge: I think Ingram said he had, well at least listened to some of the brony music and remixes
<MASF123|Disconnected> And...? His outcome was...?
<MadSurge> Vivix: that's nice :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Daniel Ingram listened to this song specifically
<tSparx> Gonna help us, put asunder, meanies who like to hate and plunder!

<Vivix> Which is a bit odd, since I've been here a while-
<Vivix> then again, I had never seen a valthejean stream either until a few days ago
<tSuperman> Vivix: Hm, I've been here 3/4 days and this is at least my second, and I think I've seen more
<Vivix> by scoot? Hm
<Vivix> Maybe my- timezone is offff or something

<DoctoDoctorWho> what is this song?
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho: Sunshine and salary stalks.
<Vivix> but I think- I can't remember what the firest episode I saw here was
<tSuperman> I'm sitting here wondering what #BronyState is like on Xmas
<Gold_Demona> Anyone here ever seen Fraggle Rock?
<Jmo> Oh dear god Fraggle Rock

<Vivix> I can't call myself a fan, but I did enjoy the little I saw on TV tSuperman
<AdamTheDuck> Book of Eli.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Alrighty, I'm done with this peice of dumb! You guys wanna watch videos or listen in to the Vinyl Scrath tapes again?
<Vivix> Gold_Demona: Ah, that's cool. I heard from the book she really likes working for valve- sounds like fun place
<tSuperman> AdamTheDuck: :D
<Jmo> That was a great movie indeed AdamTheDuck
<tSuperman> Vivix I'm 20 years old, and about a month ago I found it on Netflix. Watched it all in one weekend xD
<Eli> AdamTheDuck: ahh... yeah, nice movie. but that's my real name though
<AdamTheDuck> estatically* :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03AHEM
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I found out she was working for Valve while listening to the developers commentary in Portal 2. I recognized her voice. XD
<tSuperman> MLP isn't the only little kid's show I watch
*Jmo pokes Scoot-Scootaloo
<Vivix> Hehe, tSuperman I watched some of it when it rain on tv here, it was kinda cool. I'm 23
<tSuperman> Scoot-Scootaloo: Ambivalent
<DoctoDoctorWho> oh hell yes
<Vivix> I watch tons of animation things, I just love animation- mostly western
<Gold_Demona> Me too, but I also like some anime.
<Vivix> Gold_Demona: Aah, that's cool. Have you read the making of book? She talks about her experience and a bit about her past jobs there
<Barbetos|AtWork> gsyu! how i computer?
<tSparx> Vivix Me too, but I also LOVE Japanese anime (and manga) (and culture in general)
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I didn't even know there was a book. :P
<Eli> vinyl pic with ruby eyes? sweet! who's streamin?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Scoot-Scootaloo: If Its all right with you, I think a DBZ abridged marathon is in order
<tSparx> Scoot is, Eli
<Vivix> It's on steam for like 2 euro, it's the making of Portal 2, with tons of interviews. Really cool book, like really cool
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I'll have to check that out. =)
<Vivix> tSparx: Ah yes, I don't watch alot of anime, the animation style is quite my thing, but that's not why I don't watch much. I did read a lot of manga as a teen though
*Jmo glomps Vivix
<Jmo> nemnemnemnem
*Vivix struggles
<tSparx> Vivix: Forgive my ignorance, but about how many USD is 2 Euro?
<MASF123|Disconnected> What is God was one of uuuuuus?
<tSparx> I know it's not a huge exchange rate but
<MASF123|Disconnected> if
<Vivix> tSparx: uuh give me a sec and I'll check the exact price
<Gold_Demona> 2 Euro is like 3 bucks, isn't it?
<Gold_Demona> HUGE estimation there
<Gold_Demona> No exact math :P
<MadSurge> :O
<tSparx> Still, all I need is rough
<Barbetos|AtWork> like... 2.50 tSparx
*Vivix waiats steam store page
<DoctoDoctorWho> Scoot-Scootaloo: can we please have a DBZ abridged marathon? pretty please with fluttershy on top?
<MASF123|Disconnected> You know what always confused me? Pounds. Like in the U.K. it's all about pounds.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Nah, I have something else in mind
<tSparx> DoctoDoctorWho: We were watching a ton earlier.
<MASF123|Disconnected> For currency
<DoctoDoctorWho> awww, I missed it
<MadSurge> BOOO it's Rainbow Dash :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Am I the only one that likes this version better?
<tSparx> MASF123|Disconnected: Well, yeah, but at least it's deci-pounds and not the old conoluted system
<Vivix> Okay, steam is acting up on me, the book is called Portal 2 - Final hours, USD Euro and Pounds should be listed depending on where you live
<tSparx> Vivix Thanks! I'll look it up :)
<AdamTheDuck> Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh this is a cover? Doesn't sound too different.
<Gold_Demona> Sounds awesome. =)
<MASF123|Disconnected> I like ESP Pony's covers
<Kandarihu> DoctoDoctorWho, it seems that DBZA has become Caramel's thing.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03My thing... is something else
<tSparx> DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah but not like a ton ton. I wouldn't call it a marathon, you didn't miss a marathon don't worry :)
<Jmo> Oh my god.
<DoctoDoctorWho> ok, we gotta have one later tho
<Barbetos|AtWork> itg 3 =o
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03This is probably gonna kill me..
<AdamTheDuck> DDR? :D

<tSparx> There is totally a pony on that screen, and she is looking even more badass than usual <3
<MadSurge> :O RD!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hah!
<tSparx> Haha, this is so fast my computer can't even keep up xD
<Barbetos|AtWork> nice
<Kandarihu> She's looking bipedal, though
<Vivix> bipedal ponies make me sad
*Vivix coughs varius artist names
<tSparx> Kandarihu: No, she's just flying with her rear hooves toward the ground
<Gold_Demona> She's flying right at us!
<MadSurge> O__o the arrows, they are rebelling!
*Jmo glomps Vivix

<Gold_Demona> That's funky
<Barbetos|AtWork> I miss playing 2 all the time at the arcade I used to live near.
<MadSurge> Ok, who the hell could play with so much stuff screwing up your vision?
<tSparx> It seems like RD would be distracting as hell >_>
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ouch
<Barbetos|AtWork> Apparently she is
<AdamTheDuck> wow.
<Gold_Demona> I have tons of DDR games on PS2. It's pretty much the only form of exercise I like to do. =P
<MadSurge> DED

<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh noes!
<MadSurge> Bombs?
<DoctoDoctorWho> anyone here good with devientart?
<MASF123|Disconnected> Bomb Up!

<Barbetos|AtWork> Hitting bombs makes the meter on the left go down.
<tSparx> So essentially, this is DDR on acid?
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<AdamTheDuck> tSparx: I believe so.
<MadSurge> DEFEATED
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Good with it how?

<AdamTheDuck> Eli: You're not alone...
<RaveBrony> No way! :D
<tSparx> Eli: I don't get a lot of these jokes/references.
<DoctoDoctorWho> so back to my problem,
<tSparx> Eli: Bronydom is deep and detailed and grew so quickly, there are a ton of inside jokes and whatnot.
<LunarSS> It's from an eminem song
<Vivix> a lot of us who don't like memes don't get the jokes
<MadSurge> tSparx: don't question them, just go with the flow

<tSparx> I wish we saw more of Luna
<Malk> what are we watching?
<Vivix> Luna Eclipsed luna Is best Luna
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03one moment
<MadSurge> tSparx: more princesses in general
<Vivix> A princess needs the authority to strike down her subjects!
<DaringDerpy> hello bronystate
<RaveBrony> Those bits
<RaveBrony> Hey DaringDerpy :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo DaringDerpy
<tSparx> MadSurge: Only if Celestia's character gets developed more. I feel like she's very 2d as presented, but that there's a lot more to her
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Because this game never get's old >_>
<Vivix> I really like her canon personality
<RaveBrony> Omg :D
<MadSurge> Yes tSparx :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Haha I watched this earlier :D
<Vivix> mainly because, she's what, 4000 years old? If not more or less, and if she shows too much emotion- that feels weird
<MadSurge> Slendeeeeer :|
<Major> XD
<DaringDerpy> there was nothing?
<MadSurge> AAAAHHHH THE CAT
<RaveBrony> Aaaaahhh!!!!
<LunarSS> this is like the new bandwagon lets play game
<Major> CCCCAAAAAAAATTT!
<tSparx> Vivix: But Luna's like 3992 years old, and she gets character development and emotion and stuff.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Major> XD
<DaringDerpy> so much drama
<Vivix> tSparx: true, but she's inexperienced and unstable
<Malk> oh my gawd
<Vivix> I like how cold Celestia can be
<Petrified_Discord> lol "How do we surviiiiiiiiive?"
<tSparx> Vivix: I just think the staff could make it work and that I'd like to see it, that's all.
<DoctoDoctorWho> aaaaaaaaaand average gamer
<AJIsAwesome> Is this Slender? Who's playing it?:D
<MLP_Brovakiin> I love the face-cam at the end :D
<Vivix> tSparx: I'd have nothing against it, but I don't feel she's too 2d now
<MASF123> yay
<Malk> what is that noise?
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Like a Mary Sue?
<Barbetos|AtWork> "Shit just came out of me"
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nice
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Micheal and Gavin from Achivement Hunter
<MadSurge> This game suuuuuucks :D
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: whatn ow?
<DaringDerpy> I sometimes walk behind people at night, playing a keyboard
<Petrified_Discord> Super duper helpful not useless Slender map: http://i.imgur.com/rFFWv.jpg
<MASF123> I love this one
<tSparx> So what the hell am I watching?
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: About Celestia being 2d. You know what a Mary Sue is, right?
<Vivix> Oh yeah, but I didn't see the connectoin
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: yeah same as Vivix here
<DaringDerpy> faster!
<MASF123> C'MON ON!
<MASF123> OH SHIIIIT RUUUN!
<MadSurge> NOOOO the cat stepped on the piano again!
<tSparx> seriously wth is this
<MadSurge> tSparx: a bad game called Slender
<MASF123> It's achievement hunter
<AJIsAwesome> I can se why people would think that Celestia is 2d. She seems like that generic princess type. But maybe season 3 will give her more charcater development.
<tSparx> MadSurge: Based on that Slenderman person
<RaveBrony> :o
<MLP_Brovakiin> noo bufer :O
<Gold_Demona> I'd love to see more of all the Princesses in season 3
<MadSurge> ^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:(
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Vivx: I don't feel like she is 2d, but I feel like there's a whole lot more room for depth in her character
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: Maybe, but I feel she's nice now. Like I would not want an episode where she's sick and is tended to for instance- unless it was done really well. I like them to be a bit--deity ish
<Vivix> tSparx: oh yeah, true
<DaringDerpy> celestia is the only main character that had no psycho episode so far
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<MadSurge> NUUUUUUUU
<MadSurge> :D
<Gold_Demona> Royal Canterlot Voice!!!!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:(
<tSparx> Vivix: Oh I want the exact opposite. I wanna watch Celestia run in with the mane 6 and get her hands dirty
<MadSurge> YOU FUCKING MOROOOOOON
<Vivix> Aah, I like her to be royal- and a bit distant
<tSparx> er, hooves dirty
<Vivix> In fics I really dislike when she says "don't call me by my title" and stuff
<Gold_Demona> LOL Pill pushers XD
<MadSurge> :D
<tSparx> Vivix You remember the episode where Fluttershy steals her bird?
<Vivix> yeah
<MadSurge> :D
<Gold_Demona> Kidneys is best suit
<Petrified_Discord> I love the "rake" one :D
<RaveBrony> Lol!!!
<tSparx> Vivix That's where I first got it in my head that maybe, maybe, she would like to throw aside the royal stuff sometimes and just enjoy a nice dinner with the denizens of Ponyville
<Bunny-Striker> LOL
<Gold_Demona> LOL Took him a second to get that. XD
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Oh, same here.
<RaveBrony> Wow :D
<RaveBrony> ROFL
<Petrified_Discord> Orgasm. Yes.
<Malk> you are correct
<MASF123> I like the South Park one best
<MadSurge> FACEPALM
<Vivix> tSparx: truue- but I dunno, I would love to see her have a casual dinner with friends, but not- take of her regalia and play in the fields of ponyville. For instance-
<Bunny-Striker> MOO
<Gold_Demona> What the crap?
<Bunny-Striker> FAIL
<tSparx> Vivix: Agreed. Honestly, I don't have a direction specifically I'd like to see her go in, I'd just like to see her go ;)
<RaveBrony> Dohoho!
<Bunny-Striker> LAWL
<DaringDerpy> lol

<tSparx> THIS IS THE MOST BAD ACID TRIP CARTOON OF ALL TIME
<MadSurge> Follow dat chicken!
<cowvarkian> I lvoe those
<tSparx> THis particular episode that is
<MASF123> This takes me back to before I was born and still swimming in my father's sack.
<tSparx> Vivix I started off classical, but now am elbass
<CCCP|Colt45> MASF123 wtf lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> RaveBrony: like firefox?
<cowvarkian> oh, old cartoons, you so creepy and fun
<Gold_Demona> Favorite black and white cartoons are mostly Betty Boop.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Horror. It's about horror. This series as a whole is okay, but seriously this is one of the most fucked up cartoon bits of all time, just watch
<CCCP|Colt45> I love how creative old cartoons are
<tSparx> If this is the one I think it is, of course
<cowvarkian> Gold_Demona: I liked ahrvey the rabbit
<tSparx> Yep, this is it!
<MadSurge> Tiny chicken!
<RaveBrony> DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah. A while back DA didnt work for me on Firefox, but worked on Chrome :P
<Gold_Demona> cowvarkian: Haven't watched a lot of Harvey. Not as easy to find
<cowvarkian> yeah
<CCCP|Colt45> wat
<RaveBrony> o_o
<MASF123> Dis Bimbo?
<MadSurge> :O THE DEEEAAAAAAAAD
<killerpony7733> Hmm i wonder. Scoot-Scootaloo Would you know if you guys got a certain cartoon movie that can be choosen for movie night sometime?
<Eli> creepy :O
<Vivix> tSparx: ah, cool. I started out with elbass 9 years ago, really want a cello though
<cowvarkian> wait, are people ever actually scared by this?
<CCCP|Colt45> hai Eli
<MASF123> Cold feet
<Eli> heya CCCP|Colt45
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03If it's chosen, of course :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> RaveBrony: Ill see if that works and get back to you
<tSparx> This was recently in a Cracked article for the *x* Darkest Insane Cartoons of All Time
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo: Ok i'm thinking of ''Who framed roger rabbit''
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Seriously?:O
<Bunny_Striker> This was a kids show? CREEPY AS HELL!
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo: I wonder if that's a movie that can be shown
<DoctoDoctorWho> cowvarkian: yes, Its creepy as fuck
<MadSurge> For Rent :D
<CCCP|Colt45> im scared
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I dunno lol
<tSparx> cowvarkian: Just this episode. THe really creepy parts haven't started yet
<DaringDerpy> If this doesn't scare you to death, you've been on the Internets for too long
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo: Welp i hope it is, Cause that movie is awesome
<CCCP|Colt45> the lag is killing me :(
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: Well idk about to death, but it is certainly creepy
<DaringDerpy> I'm bored
<PillowPoni|AFK> What are you guys watching?
<MASF123> I think there was one with the KKK members. No joke.
<MadSurge> It's not very creepy right now
<cowvarkian> wait, but this isnt scary
<tSparx> MASF123: After watching Birth of a Nation, no KKK-based cultural touchstones shock me anymore
<MASF123> Yeah it's not
<cowvarkian> this is just a good old cartoon
<Gold_Demona> MASF123: Doesn't surprise me. People weren't NEARLY as concerned with political correctness back then.
<DaringDerpy> deserves him right for stealing a chicken
<DaringDerpy> -de
<Gold_Demona> People weren't frickin pansies about it back then
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: kinda :D
<CCCP|Colt45> Alot of Americans we're in the KKK in the 20's
<cowvarkian> not really
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, political correctness didn't exist until the 1990s
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Ikr .__.
<Kandarihu> At least not in America
<Dragonmatte> Okay dafuq xD
<MadSurge> GHOST ASS
<MASF123> So it's an American passtime?
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: This is true.
<Vivix> Political Correctness esd invented in 1930s america after very racy movies and plays
<RAWRity> Gold_Demona: if by "weren't pansies" you mean "they lynched lack people for misbehaving" then yes, you're correct.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03CCCP: No, it was mostly 1930's. Even then, they were frouwned upon by the maority of the population
<Vivix> it was --removed in the 1960s
<Petrified_Discord> Makes perfect sense to me.
<cowvarkian> CCCP|Colt45: KKK was a deep south thing
<Vivix> then reinvented in the late 90s
<DaringDerpy> this was probably a tech demo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03frowned*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03majority*
<RAWRity> Because honestly, I'll take people being too sensitive about the word black over race riots and murder.
<Gold_Demona> RAWRity: That's not what I mean at all.
<CCCP|Colt45> Scoot-Scootaloo i see
<MadSurge> RAWRity: indeed
<cowvarkian> oh wait, are they lynching that cartoon because he's black?
<tSparx> Yeah, PC can and often is taken to a ridiculous extreme, but the general idea that we should just be nice to people and respect them is what MLP's all about, eh?
<Dragonmatte> D:
<DaringDerpy> now it gets interesting
<MASF123> I don't know why I don't like these cartoons.
<MadSurge> cowvarkian: most likely because he stole a chicken
<CCCP|Colt45> cowvarkian Is it bad that thats the first thing a associate the South with?
<tSparx> Yeah, here's where it starts to get FUCKED UP
<MASF123> It's what started it all.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I am thoroughly convinced that nothing can suprise me anymore
<cowvarkian> yeah, but it happens CCCP|Colt45
<RAWRity> I ust think it's fun to watch on a technical level. I mean, this was all done by hand.
<EQUINE_excite> ...what am I looking at here
<CCCP|Colt45> i know
<CCCP|Colt45> hai RAWRity
<cowvarkian> even though its true
<PillowPoni|AFK> What are you guys looking at
<tSparx> EQUINE_excite: an episode of a cartoon *clearly* inspired by acid
<MadSurge> DED :D
<NocturnalBlade> morning everypony
<Kandarihu> Considering the time it was made, it's not a charactiture of black people unless he has big lips.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You know what? I think I will show a pony episode today!
<AJIsAwesome> That's it?
<RAWRity> Scoot-Scootaloo: OH LORD

<CrazyHippie1234> Lil_B: :/ Grammar
<Kandarihu> How about fandubs in languages that are either dead or conlangs?
<sonicandmario85> SWEET APPLE ARCES
<Lil_B> CrazyHippie1234 : )
<tSparx> Eli Caelus/coelus is Latin for heaven
<RaveBrony> Eeeha? :D
<CCCP|Colt45> http://derpy.me/LgsWo
<DaringDerpy> klingon?
<Bunny_Striker> why does Twilight sound manlier than Spike?
<cowvarkian> I would love that Kandarihu
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: Ancient Greek My Little Pony!
<MadSurge> MASF123: Of course, can't you see how my english is poor and disarticulated? :P
<cowvarkian> latin or klingon or something
<NocturnalBlade> oi applejack
<RaveBrony> CCCP|Colt45: Dat Draw friend stuff :D
<MASF123> MadSurge haven't noticed.
<RAWRity> oh good lord AJ's voice
<CCCP|Colt45> http://derpy.me/0JjjU
<tSparx> RAWRity: heh Hellenika would be fun ;)
<CCCP|Colt45> RaveBrony: :P :D
<cowvarkian> Dude, your english is better then some peoople who've lived in america their whole life, madsurge
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Almozar companeras =\= Soups on, everypony
<Kandarihu> I was thinking Klingon, but the vocabulary in that language is limited to a Klingon mindset.
<tSparx> Yeah Madsurge, your English is certainly passable
<MadSurge> MASF123: I studied english since middle school :D
<MASF123> AJ doesn't have a SOuthern accent yes now you all know
<Lil_B> Scoot-Scootaloo is there a special reason why spanish or are you generelly do multilanguage Ep1?
<DaringDerpy> http://i.imgur.com/1V2Zh.jpg
<EQUINE_excite> Spanish parallel to cowboy dialect?
<RaveBrony> Ahpelbluwm!
<MASF123> MadSurge, you speak decent
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Because people wanted a pony episode...
<Kandarihu> The closest thing to a greeting in the Klingon language pretty much translates to "What do you want?"
<Eli> MadSurge... don't say "my english is bad" and disarticulated in the same sentence
<MASF123> Haha
<Hackalot> EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
<NocturnalBlade> Scoot-Scootaloo: they ask and they shall recieve lol
<RaveBrony> Im half Colombian, but i dont know spanish :(
<killerpony7733> cowvarkian: I heard a few tell me for someone who has learned english, By myself i certainly have a very good english compared to some english users and my friend knows since he is british
<cowvarkian> hmm
<CCCP|Colt45> http://derpy.me/qHBfw is this supposed to be a referance to Shadow of the Colussus?
<MASF123> RaveBrony my friend is Puerto Rican and he can't speak Spanish
<MadSurge> Eli: why not?
<tSparx> spanish!Twilight doesn't appear to have that scathing sarcasm in her
<CrazyHippie1234> Hackalot: DALEK!
<Kandarihu> Maybe Elvish would be good, or Esperanto. A Latin translation would be lulzy when it comes to Luna.
<RaveBrony> Dat laugh :D
<MASF123> RD
<MASF123> Haha Excuse me?
<Hackalot> XD Doctor Who FTW
<Major> CCCP|Colt45: Indeed :P
<CrazyHippie1234> Hackalot: /)
<MASF123> BAAAHAHAHA
<Kandarihu> I guess Klingon IS the most famous conlang.
<cowvarkian> hmm
<CCCP> Major ^-^ hai
<Hackalot> (\
<MadSurge> CCCP: yep
<tSparx> Kandarihu: You don't think it's Esperanto?
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Well good you are quite good at english. I had to learn it myself :)
<Marco> sounds like i'm missing out on something, what is playing on the stream at the moment?
<MASF123> The only and original
<Major> CCCP: hi :3
<Gold_Demona> Klingon would be the most hilarious
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: its just the most used
<Vivix> Esperanto could be interesting
<RaveBrony> Los Wonderbolts! :D
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: where are you from?
<EQUINE_excite> I'm already used to it
<MASF123> Yeah yeah that's easy in a second
<tSparx> Los Wonderbolts!
<DaringDerpy> no one speaks esperanto
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Major
<cowvarkian> is esperanto really a language?
<RaveBrony> Exacto!
<RaveBrony> Im loving this :D
<DaringDerpy> better try elbish
<CrazyHippie1234> RaveBrony: We all are
<MadSurge> cowvarkian: not really :D
<cowvarkian> or a gibberish translation
<RaveBrony> :)
<Vivix> cowvarkian: yeah, attempt at international simple language
*RAWRity demands a Swahili Dub next.
<tSparx> cowvarkian: It's an artifical language, just like Elvish and Klingon
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Greenland originally. Currently living in Denmark, I'm purely danish by blood
<cowvarkian> ah
<MASF123> It's not gibberish if I can understand it
<cowvarkian> I'm part of that thing, killerpony7733
<CrazyHippie1234> Dat AD
<tSparx> DEUTSCH PONIES ODER JAPANESE PONIES ODER BUST
<MASF123> Haha your expression on your face
<killerpony7733> cowvarkian: Part of?
<Lil_B> Los Wonderbolts ot Los Pegasos
<sonicandmario85> i wish there was subtitles so i could understand it
<sonicandmario85> XD
<RaveBrony> Rarity time!! <3
<CrazyHippie1234> DAT RARITY!
<MASF123> Beautiful
<DaringDerpy> die deutschen ponies klingen seltsam
<RAWRity> inb4 raritys VA is horrible
<MASF123> HER!
<cowvarkian> I have dutch ancestors, though I'm sure a lot of americans do
<RaveBrony> Shes fine :)
<MadSurge> sonicandmario85: you're not missing anything new :D
<MASF123> Goodafternoon
<tSparx> RAWRity: That's actually prtty good
<Kandarihu> Well, at first, I didn't even give specifics when I suggested a conlang fandub. And the first thing that came up was Klingon.
<killerpony7733> cowvarkian: Ah i see.
<Hackalot> 5 Upvotes and 6 Downvotes with 56 views alltogether...Not bad for my first fanfic
<RaveBrony> Needs more Wahaha!
<CCCP> RAWRity i think shes alright
<MASF123> Oh my stars!
<Lil_B> DaringDerpy I think they sound good, they still portrai their chraracters right
<CCCP> so far
<MASF123> Hairstyle not "mane"
<MASF123> WTH
<cowvarkian> dont question
<MadSurge> RAWRity: did you hear any really terrible VAs for Rarity?
<MASF123> I will
<MASF123> because I can
<DaringDerpy> she's not dead yet!
<MASF123> In Merica
<cowvarkian> if translation is hilarious, just laugh
<MASF123> sure
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/rSGW2 is this an OC?
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: But yeah i got ace at my exam before summer, So i got a really good oral english. Though i can certainly improve on both written and oral.
<RaveBrony> Time for some Fluttershy
<CrazyHippie1234> Fluttershy!!!!!!
<Lil_B> Ok gonna stop the stream until my Steam is done updating the games XD just too much lag
<killerpony7733> CCCP: I think so
<RAWRity> That was more just a precautionary thing. From what I can tell, Rarity and Aj's voices are always the hardest ones to get right in other languages. SOmething about the Southern or Mid-atlantic accents just doesn't translate well.
<tSparx> Well, I'm gonna take a nap, and then pack up my life to take it to my dorm.
<Kandarihu> When something gets translated into every language in existance, someone will always translate it into Klingon just for lulz.
<DaringDerpy> I just decided that I learn my next language by watching ponies
<CCCP> Fluttershy is the best pony in the entire show, even though everypony is equal she breaks the rule
<cowvarkian> Klingon is always for the lulz
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: I demand a Na'avi dub.
<cowvarkian> I wonder if theirs a bible in klingon
<MASF123> Soy Twilight Sparkle
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, there is.
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: well I got a really good time at BUCK, and people seemed to understand me fine :D
<cowvarkian> unsurprising
<CCCP> lag
<RAWRity> cowvarkian: yup. there was a guy selling them at Otacon
<RaveBrony> o_o
<DaringDerpy> too loud
<MASF123> Haha
<RAWRity> oh good lord.
<cowvarkian> hmm
<MASF123> Brueno
<cowvarkian> <.<
<RAWRity> jesus christ.
<MASF123> Keep working
<MASF123> Very good
<Dovah> Good morning everypony
<RaveBrony> Squeaking is too loud :D
<RAWRity> that's...horrid
<CCCP> hello Dovah
<RaveBrony> Hey, Dovah :P
<CCCP> RAWRity what is?
<DaringDerpy> batcha?
<Gold_Demona> Un bebe drag?n! ^^
<RAWRity> CCCP: Flutter's VA
<cowvarkian> hey Dovah
<RaveBrony> Soy Spike
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: Morning!
<MASF123> Wait Wait
<Kandarihu> I once downloaded an open source bible program called SWORD Project. It contains a lot of freely available translations of the Bible, and one of them IS in Klingon.
<MASF123> WHat do you call him?
<CCCP> D: RAWRity i dont agree :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodmorning Dovah
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Besides the fact i can be really silly and trip over myself and lose track of what i'm saying. I'm very easy to understand as i learned to bypass the danish accent i carry and use a bit more america/canadian type one
<DoctoDoctorWho> hi Dovah
<MadSurge> Noooo :'( don't ruin 'Shyyy
<MASF123> Abosulty everything
*RAWRity demands a Dub in Mermish, the language of the Merpeople
<RaveBrony> Dormirrr
<cowvarkian> I remember talking to danish people a few years ago...
<MASF123> They do a decent job actually.
<cowvarkian> fun language that
<MASF123> Poor thing
<Kandarihu> It even has a Klingon Alphabet, probably based on code meant for East Asian langauge.
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: same :D when I get going I get as excited as Pinkie :D
<Lil_B> you guys should l watch the Photo Finish Episode in Spain... Fluttershys rage scream is terrifiying XD
<Vivix> Danish sound bizarre to all us scandinavians, kinda sweet though
<RaveBrony> Yeah, the VAs arent bad, its just that FS squeak was way off :D
*Jmo glomps Vivix
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: I've seen it.........:S
<cowvarkian> yeah
<RaveBrony> Pinkies VA is great :D
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Heard that :D
<MASF123> SUPRISA!
<cowvarkian> She actually sounds like pinkie
<RAWRity> Burrito?
<MASF123> SI SI??
<CCCP> :D
<cowvarkian> sortof
<killerpony7733> Vivix: Hey now. Danish is ok, but it's more about our accents when we speak english with it
<MASF123> She said I'm bored.
<EQUINE_excite> pony pony pony!
<Kandarihu> DERPY!
<MASF123> Not burrtio lol
<RaveBrony> This is great since Spanish people talk really fast :D (or at least my spanish relatives do)
<CCCP> the first time i met Pinkie Pie i didnt really like her that much...
<Gold_Demona> I love Pinkie's spanish voice. XD
<Vivix> killerpony7733: oh yeah, I think it sounds nice, but it's bizarre when you can understand like half of it, and not all of it. You know?
<MASF123> Aww...she's crying with happiness!
<EQUINE_excite> UNce unce unce
<RaveBrony> Vamos!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03LOCAS!

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Colgate's Toothpaste Canon Commercial
<MASF123> Locas!
<cowvarkian> Well, if you understand one of the scandinavian languages, it should be easy enough to get most of it, unless my grasp of languange knowledge is less then I thought it to be
<killerpony7733> Vivix: Oh yeah like hearing swedish and norwegian and sometimes losing the track of what they are saying
<MASF123> You know what time it is?
<DaringDerpy> mimimimimimimimimimimimi
<MASF123> It's a party!
<MadSurge> Best italian VA is the Fluttershy/Applejack one, but Twilight's and Pinkie's are pretty good too :D
<Vivix> killerpony7733: yeah, it's kinda fun to half understand something that way.
<Kandarihu> Hmm, Pinkie Pie likes hot sauce on her cupcakes, but rainbow syrup is too much for her, I guess?
<Vivix> cowvarkian: yeah we can-understand eachother pretty well, but a lot of words are reaaally different. It can make full conversation hard
<killerpony7733> Vivix: Swedes has some odd words that can be understood very ''differently'' in danish
<cowvarkian> ah, ok vivix
<Vivix> yeah
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: rainbow is too much for everyone
<killerpony7733> Vivix: Don't remind me what a cow is called and sleeping bags >_<
<MaxTheBrony> Heya :)
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: Oi
<MASF123> of summer?
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, true. It's not meant for consumption in that state.
<MASF123> WTF
<Vivix> In my language its Ku - kyr and sovepose
<DaringDerpy> I, as German, don't understand anything of what they say. Not even sure if Scandinavian or Dutch.
<Kiryu> I can has spanish! :D
<RaveBrony> No es bueno D:
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute. It's not meant for consumption in ANY state.
<MASF123> I can speak Spanish I win!
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: probably it's like eating raw jalapenos
<Kiryu> Ay mucho poopo

<RaveBrony> Oh, i saw this on EqD
<DoctoDoctorWho> Eli isnt english considered one of the hardest languages to learn along with japanese?
<Fisheh_Fish> Hmm
<CCCP> bye erryprny
<Fisheh_Fish> Bye CCCP
<RaveBrony> Cya CCCP!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye CCCP
<Vivix> Japanese usually takes 3 years to learn, it is not considered hard to learn, only to write
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: Bye!
<CrazyHippie1234> bye CCCP
<TheKoreanBrony1354> english is suoer is though
*CCCP hugs Fisheh_Fish RaveBrony MLP_Brovakiin AJIsAwesome and CrazyHippie1234
<Kencolt> See, the problem with the Spanish scream is that it's actual SCREAM... instead of Fluttershy's not quite a scream and in fact it's barely a squeaks I'm soorry about that scaream.
<PONY> DoctoDoctorWho, English is considered relatively easy language
<TheKoreanBrony1354> fgggggggkkkukukukkk,
<PONY> (and so is Japanese)
<sonicandmario85> LAUGH AT THE TREES FLUTTERSHY
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ASDW

<Fisheh_Fish> This is pretty cool :)
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ASWEQ
<MadSurge> PONY: indeed, not many verbal declinations
<killerpony7733> PONY: Yep i'm self taught by myself and video games. And i'm pretty ok
<SirGanjalf> DoctoDoctorWho: Hardest? I think English is one of the easiest laguages. One of the reasons why it's so popular
<Eli> DoctoDoctorWho: WUT? really? i have never heard that, and frankly, of all the languages i have ever looked into, i find english the easiest. heck i prefer it over german!
<AJIsAwesome> Kencolt: You're right. If the VA read the script correctly, she would know.
<AJIsAwesome> This is amazing.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Somepony ping me
<SirGanjalf> trippy, but fun!
<MadSurge> TheKoreanBrony1354: PING
<AJIsAwesome> TheKoreanBrony1354: LOTSA SPAGHETTI!
<DoctoDoctorWho> ok, guess my source was horribly uninformed
<MLP_Brovakiin> TheKoreanBrony1354: Hallo
<Vivix> English is popular because it's widespread, but it is one of the easier languages, and so is japanese. One of the hardest langauges is Finnish I think
<TheKoreanBrony1354> trtbro hoof MadSurge AJIsAwesome
<Fisheh_Fish> TheKoreanBrony1354: Hai
<PONY> Eli, definetly easier than German, less grammatical rules, and more flexible build
<TheKoreanBrony1354> HAI Fisheh_Fish
<SirGanjalf> I want what she's having!
<Vivix> There's a list over hardest languages by some language society thing whatever, and english is not high on that
<PONY> DoctoDoctorWho, your source was either horrible bad at English, or over proud of it as a languaage.
<StinkomanFan> Fluttershy is a pretty pone
<killerpony7733> Vivix: Well the language you gets the most far with. Is english cause it's become a requirement and the higher your level of english is the better
<MadSurge> Yay, cute Fluttershy! :3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03dAMN...
<Fisheh_Fish> That was cool
<TheKoreanBrony1354> fluttersh #1
<sonicandmario85> rRAINBOW APPLE
<Eli> DoctoDoctorWho: but it also depends what your normal language is. english has the same origins as german, thus it was easier for me to learn. french and italian have difrent ones, so i have problems with that
<AJIsAwesome> THAT WAS EPIC.:O
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Well, Fluttershy getting high is canon!
<CrazyHippie1234> Zap apple sonicandmario85
<DoctoDoctorWho> SirGanjalf: she's having a blast so...*cocks shotgun*
<Vivix> killerpony7733: yes, it's modern days latin. It will, like most things, probably die out at some point, but it's our international language, you need it for many job things

<AJIsAwesome> *she's*
<Jmo> Oh joy.
*PONY is a PONY
<Vivix> And anything fanmade can never be canon
<killerpony7733> Vivix: In basic it opens a large amount of doors for things if you are at a decent level or even more at higher levels
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> but as a langauge it is really weird
*Eli usese the stare on sonicandmario85 (just so)
<Vivix> it lacks a ton of pronouns, and is a mix of three strong languages-
<Vivix> it's Weird
*sonicandmario85 stare doesnt work

<killerpony7733> Vivix: And wanna know something odd. I'm starting to think english has become more of a primary language for me as i'm actually a bit sucky at my own language like not that bad. But i certainly seem to have it a ton times easier and can speak alot more in english
<CrazyHippie1234> O_O

<Vivix> killerpony7733: I am better at written grammar in English than Norwegian, but - english is more lenient towards that anyway, right? I love my language, but it sounds weird in poetry and art

<Vivix> Unnr: yeah- sadly. I'm sure we'll recover, but- there's mostly Crime and weird attempts at sounding high class
<sonicandmario85> well it wasnt that bad
<Kencolt> And this is going to be worse, isn't it?
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, I'm sick of all the This Day Aria remixes.
<Fisheh_Fish> TheKoreanBrony1354: Magic.MOV?
<sonicandmario85> THIS IS SPARTA!
<Vivix> Unnr: I think it's a pretty language, and I like speaking it, but it's so hard to write fiction in it, for me
<DoctoDoctorWho> THE BURNING OF THE EYES WITH THE HORRIBLE ANIMATION AND THE FIRE AND THE oh wait its over,
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: I love that song so much, that I have sworn to never listen to a single remix. Woo! Still not broken
<Kencolt> Why remix a song that was already perfect to begin with?
<Vivix> Yes
<Unnr> Vivix, the best you can do is hope for a norwegian answer to Låt den rätte komma in
<sonicandmario85> DoctoDoctorWho:they are G4 toys and its fan made....
<PillowPoni|Reading> Kencolt: because remix wars? :3
<Vivix> Unnr: I haven't read that, new book?
<PONY> Eli, noch mein Deutsch ist besser als du Finnisch.
<SirGanjalf> Is TF2's birthday today?
<Unnr> Older swedish book, its the text that Let the Right One Is/ Let Me In is based off
<PillowPoni|Reading> Speaking of remix wars....I can't wait for the entries for RW V to be released
<Vivix> Ooh
<Unnr> and by older, I mean 2004
<Vivix> Hehe
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Epic Art: What Friendship is All About
<ROBODA> could be better, PONY
<Vivix> Yeah I hope we get a cool new book, or a series.
<Unnr> Would be good, I need an excuse to practice reading modern norwegian
<Kencolt> Tjis doesn't even sound like the same piece at ALL. Its totally unrecogniable. Well, until just now.
<Vivix> The last Norwegian series I read was Isfolket, and that's written by a swedish lady- and it's not ALL that good. Crazy perverted with no agelimit as well
<LunarSS> dat stock arpeggio
<DoctoDoctorWho> sonicandmario85: if mlp was really a half-assed gimick to kick off a toy line like haters say one would think they would have made better toys,
<PONY> ROBODA, you don't born best at anything, I've merely had a year, which from I haven't had too much time to study.
<Kencolt> Who9ever you are,m Kingspartax37-- I'm sorry but you FAIL.
<AJIsAwesome> Brb.
<ROBODA> ok, for a year's study that's quite good
<Kencolt> That was awful. Sorry. But that wa AWFUL.
<Unnr> Vivix: Isfolket, is that the wayyyyyyy too long series by Sandemo?
<PONY> ROBODA, I haven't even studied, this is just some I've pretty much caught from the wind.
<Fisheh_Fish> This is quite catchy
<sonicandmario85> guys guess what? i found this video on youtube XD
<sonicandmario85> the exact same one
<Vivix> Unnr: yeah, It's kinda fun but I read it when I was 14, so my memory might be glorified. It's a bit trashy and-- dude it's crazy perverted, despite originating from a magazine for housewives
<MLP_Brovakiin> sonicandmario85: What is it called?
<StinkomanFan> yayayayayayayay
<Vivix> It has like demon guys with horse wangs doing ladies
<Vivix> Explicitly described
<sonicandmario85> MLP_Brovakiin:dr.fluttershy
<killerpony7733> Vivix: Oh my.
<StinkomanFan> I'd go to Doctor Fluttershy
<Unnr> Of course its trashy originating for a magazine for housewifes
<sonicandmario85> i think
<Vivix> And no agelimit, books don't have--agelimits it seem
<Vivix> Hehehe, Unnr you have a point
<Unnr> Anypony that has ever read a romance novel coult tell you that
<Vivix> It's weird, all those ladies are perverts
<Vivix> Well "all"
<Kencolt> Who is streaming this evilk, anyhow?
<SirGanjalf> That SFM
<DoctoDoctorWho> well I have work to do, see you all later
<FlutterMEDIC> so much SFM on youtube
<Fisheh_Fish> Later DoctoDoctorWho
<ROBODA> Kencolt: i think it's Scoot-Scootaloo
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye DoctoDoctorWho
<Vivix> I kinda liked Isfolket because it spans from 1500-1960, so it has a lot of--time stuff and eh familyttree in start of book, but- yeah I wouldn't read it again
<sonicandmario85> tf2 XD
<PONY> DoctoDoctorWho, we will meet again.
<ROBODA> it is :D
<SirGanjalf> sonicandmario85: & L4D2
<sonicandmario85> AW YEAH ITS BACON TIME!

<Jmo> o.o
<Vivix> and ofcourse, lordi from Melodi grand prix
<Unnr> Vivix, don´t forget they are all witches

<killerpony7733> Vivix: I remember when they won back then,
<StinkomanFan> BROHUG
<Vivix> Yeahh, it was so odd
<Vivix> And the year after, all countries had like rock entrances

<sonicandmario85> SHADDUP
<Fisheh_Fish> God, this brings back fond memories of childhood
<StinkomanFan> FFFF-

<MLP_Brovakiin> O_o
<Jmo> O.O
<FlutterMEDIC> ...
<Fisheh_Fish> uh oh
<Unnr> But seriously, the idea of america in the contest.... it would just end in tears and frames
<Jmo> I don't have the  on me.
<Vivix> Aww..

<Vivix> Unnr: yeaah. oh you remember Idol international? They lost the first year and never set it up again

<Fisheh_Fish> Oooooh
<StinkomanFan> OH SO SATISFYING

<sonicandmario85> ITS A STATUE DUMBASS
<Vivix> But america in Eurovision could be fun, if they sent the same--you know indie ish songwriters with unknown singers
<StinkomanFan> "Yes honey"
<Fisheh_Fish> Amputake
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Damn, Arthur just messed up her arm :O
<Unnr> It could be fun, yes, but the closest thing to an indie-act you could probably expect them to send are winners of American Idol
<PONY> This is why children should be raised in tubes.
<Fisheh_Fish> "no TV for a week" Lol, that's nothing
<pwny> no MLP for a week!!!
<Vivix> oh yeah
<Jmo> The  strikes back.
<Fisheh_Fish> My parents would have tanned my hide, and then grounded me for a month

<Wrek> if a fucking discrage
<Jmo> I feel happy enough to even get it on PC.
<Wrek> well Jmo
<HellsFortune> same as darksiders 2..... they ported everything and didnt make the options
<Bronysith> im just glad i can use a 360 controller on it BUT I LIKE KEYBOARD BETTER
<Wrek> due to the horrible port and all the controsl being unusable
<HellsFortune> or even a .cfg file for it
<sonicandmario85> and im sure im never gonnabe a mod because of hpow i act xD
<Wrek> i cant play it
<sonicandmario85> how*
<sonicandmario85> gonna be*
<Vivix> what game?
<Jmo> Dark Souls
<Vivix> Ooh
<Jmo> I'd be trying it with a controller due it being a straight port.
<Dovah> Wrek: would you recomend getting Dark Souls for pc?
<Jmo> to*
<Vivix> Yeah, get a controler for bad ports-
<Wrek> onyl if you have a pad
<Wrek> i dont
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wrek: Use a console control on you PC
<Vivix> the worst port was Gta4, which used way more than it needed
<MLP_Brovakiin> *Your
<Wrek> MLP_Brovakiin: I DONT OWN ONE
<Vivix> if you have ps3 you can use that
<Dovah> well I do so when i get a bit more money I'll get it

<Jmo> Time to party in Dark Souls.
<Vivix> Too bad- bad ports are terrible, obviously
<HellsFortune> i miss t-dog
<RaveBrony> :o
<moobull69> the companies need to stop making games for consoles then doing a half-assed port to pc. But its not happening cuz consoles make the moneys
<Vivix> Worst I've ever head was eh Stronghold 3, wouldn't even launch thanks to countless bugs
<RaveBrony> Mfw i havent realized my chat has been dead for 6 minutes :D
<moobull69> What happened to the days where they made games on pc then made an awful port to the consoles? LOL
<FlutterMEDIC> those were the days
<HellsFortune> dat song
<FlutterMEDIC> this song is familiar
<FlutterMEDIC> wait, this is the song Jessica Rabbit sang in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
<NocturnalBlade|Youtu> FlutterMEDIC: i dont think so?
<Stinko|Laundry> I hate watching people play games I ussually play. It gets me pissed off at who wrong they do things.
<killerpony7733> FlutterMEDIC: And you win 1+ respect from me knowing the movie
<FlutterMEDIC> i distinctly remember the "Get outta here" part in her voice
<Stinko|Laundry> Did wrek beat that Sunset Saspirilla side-quest?

<Barbetos|AtWork> Dirty SAVE LOADER!!
<Godwrath> everyone knows slow-motion murder is best committed with classy country tunes.
<Golakka> ^
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sexy tunes.
<Golakka> who is streaming this afternoon?
<Godwrath> spam that F5!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wrek Golakka
<Godwrath> or whatever quicksave is in Fallout, whatever
<Golakka> But, no desktop onies?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Fallotu ate them
<Barbetos|AtWork> Litterally.
<FlutterMEDIC> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Golakka> brb, bog

<Golakka> also, i have constant ping noises....
<otakon17> Its Wrek
<StinkomanFan> BOOM
<FlutterMEDIC> HEADSHOT
<Golakka> oh silly wrek
<StinkomanFan> Wrek sure loves killing the innocent
<Barbetos|AtWork> Forget the head shot. Shoot him in the toes. That is real pain.
<Golakka> There is no such thing as innocence
<otakon17> They are feral ghouls
<Golakka> only degrees of guilt
<StinkomanFan> Remember the time he slaughtered those kids because they made fun of him?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Imagine stubing your toew at 600 mph
<otakon17> Feral ghouls are muts
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah.
<killerpony7733> Golakka: Oh god that quote
<FlutterMEDIC> You know what hurts more? Watching a Nazis balls exploding in Sniper Elite V2
<otakon17> Lol
*Golakka stares into killerpony7733s soul
<Golakka> I WILL SPLIT YOUR THOUGHTS OPEN!!!
<FlutterMEDIC> whut
<killerpony7733> Golakka: Hah good thing i got no soul
<killerpony7733> :3
<Golakka> *fails perils*
<Barbetos|AtWork> NO CLIP!!
<Golakka> *explodes*
<StinkomanFan> I saw one video where he popped two testicals pop with one bullet FlutterMedic
<Barbetos|AtWork> Robaz?
<FlutterMEDIC> But you know what's more satisfying? Watching HITLER'S balls getting shot off!
<Golakka> go somewhere with huge rad/secs
<Golakka> like 300 rutgens an hour :D
<FlutterMEDIC> HOLY HAND GRENADES
<Golakka> oh lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> LOL!
<Barbetos|AtWork> NICE
<otakon17> Yes
<FlutterMEDIC> MONTY PYTHON REFERENCES EVERYWHERE
<otakon17> He took wild wasteland didn't he?
<Fisheh_Fish> heh
<StinkomanFan> Hitler man, never has it been more fun than to blow hitler's brains out.
<Vivix> everyone, press arrow key up on your chat. And watch what you've said flash by your eyes
<FlutterMEDIC> or his testicles
<StinkomanFan> otakon17, why not?
<otakon17> Look out for Vorpal Rabbit!
<Jmo> o.o
<Fisheh_Fish> Hmm... I don't remember saying some of this stuff ._.
<Vivix> So many weird things in history
<Golakka> Saturn, you there?
<Golakka> Oh wow, I love this tune <£
<FlutterMEDIC> gud song is gud
<killerpony7733> I don't want to set the world on fire <3
<Golakka> Hmm, Vera Lynn would work well in fallout
<FlutterMEDIC> some people do want to set the world on fire
<otakon17> Well theyre nuts
<FlutterMEDIC> exactly
<Barbetos|AtWork> otakon17: which kind? Cashew?
<FlutterMEDIC> Acorn
<otakon17> No
<alexxm|colt> so what movies are we watching tonight
<otakon17> Almond
<Barbetos|AtWork> =0
<otakon17> No idea alexxm|colt
<Barbetos|AtWork> Almonds are good.
<FlutterMEDIC> Acorns arent
<otakon17> Almonds are evil!
<Barbetos|AtWork> otakon17: Then how do you feel about Almonds Mounds?
<Fisheh_Fish> I have a phobia of almonds because traumatizing childhood experience
<FlutterMEDIC> dems good eating
<Barbetos|AtWork> Or whatever that candy bar is
<otakon17> Pure delicious evil
<Barbetos|AtWork> Suddenly frame drop
<Yahooz> >candybars
<Yahooz> >Wrek
<Yahooz> oh boy
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well I am coconut. So I guess I am in the clear.
<otakon17> Almond Joy
<Barbetos|AtWork> ^
<Barbetos|AtWork> Isn't there a mounds one though?
<FlutterMEDIC> somewhere in the world there is
<Barbetos|AtWork> Or am I crazy? You know what, don't answer that. I already know.
<MadSurge> Wrek, you know you WILL have to play Dark Souls right? :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> MadSurge: Nope
<Wrek> i will not play darksouls untill they fix the controls
<Wrek> i litteraly cant
<FlutterMEDIC> you know what i cant wait for? Watch Dogs and Assassin's Creed 3
<alexxm|colt> i keep hearing ping noises
<otakon17> Wrek: Get a wired controller, it'll take less time
<Wrek> for what money?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am getting one today myself.
<StinkomanFan> Still waiting to see Wrek's sadism in action in Sniper Elite V2
<FlutterMEDIC> Do it. noaw.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Remember. Toe. Shot.
<StinkomanFan> Pop a nazi scientest in the kidney
<Barbetos|AtWork> 600 mph stubb ya toe.
<Barbetos|AtWork> worst pain EVER
<FlutterMEDIC> no. Ball. Shot.
<FlutterMEDIC> Exploding Testicles. We need zem.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Both. At the same time.
<StinkomanFan> I remember playing a Sniper Elite demo
<StinkomanFan> SO
<StinkomanFan> SATISFYING
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dead Rising 2 was more satisfying. Suplexing a zombie is best thing ever.
<GilDash|Gaming> Holla everypony! :)
<otakon17> Back
<killerpony7733> GilDash|Gaming: Hiya
<otakon17> Hiya GilDash|Gaming
<StinkomanFan> It's more satisfying to see a nazi GET A BULLET THROUGH HIS HELMET AND INTO HIS SKULL
<otakon17> No
<otakon17> Through the scope
<StinkomanFan> Even better if it comes out his eye
<otakon17> And calm down there
<killerpony7733> StinkomanFan: Still the most cringe worthy is nut shots
<FlutterMEDIC> definitely
<otakon17> Wrek: That place is pretty clear of loot tbh
<otakon17> I feel this song atm
<Major> Ping?
<StinkomanFan> Cringeworthy, yes, but what's the most funny one you can think of?
<Wrek> otakon17: but quest T~T
<StinkomanFan> Shoot some dude in the ASS, went out his testicals. SO WORTH IT
<FlutterMEDIC> i think a cool one is Remote Detonation of grenades
<otakon17> Wrek: Oh well you should pop on a Rad Suit
<otakon17> Hmmmm
<MLP_Brovakiin> otakon17: He has a mask from the lonesome road DLC, it asd 40% red resistance
<StinkomanFan> It only stops the rads up to one point of radiation at a time
<otakon17> Nice
<otakon17> Wb Terminus-Bot
<otakon17> Welcome Cranberry_Scotch
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Fallout 2 Little Pip Mod

<killerpony7733> Thunder-Crescent: That was about during the summer. So no tonights a mystery/surprise
<cowvarkian> dat holy frag grenade
<FlutterMEDIC> if the Scott Pilgrim movie is tonight, then AWESOME
<Bronysith> otakon17: i just killed the gaping dragon!
<otakon17> No idea
<killerpony7733> It isn't tonights a surprise BMN
<cowvarkian> that sounds dirty Bronysith
<Thunder-Crescent> is it the same movie on all or is it the same movie on all channels
<otakon17> Bronysith: Bah, hes easy did you get his weapon though?
<Bronysith> otakon17: yup, cut off his tail
<Dovah> Bronysith: how dare you speak of Dark Souls when I dont have it yet!
<killerpony7733> Thunder-Crescent: Theres one stream and that one only.
<Kakumy> I wonder there will be a fallout 4..

<Thunder-Crescent> awesome then i don't have to check
<Thunder-Crescent> cool
<cowvarkian> because when is the question, not if
<Kakumy> cowvarkian: when
<otakon17> Spectrum_Rush: Just a nod to the MS from F3
<Spectrum_Rush> k
<Dovah> Bronysith: depends on what type of character you're makeing usually I dont level my streanght past 40
<Kandarihu> I used to be a ranger like you, until I took a big-iron to the hip
<cowvarkian> it'll probably be anounced when a new console is
<Kandarihu> Er, oops
<cowvarkian> *not including the wii u
<Dovah> Bronysith: but if you want to use heavy weps get it to 60
<Kakumy> cowvarkian: Fallout 4 with better graphics than Skyrim
<cowvarkian> yeah
<StinkomanFan> Brotherhood of balls of steel
<cowvarkian> And a supposedly better console generation would be needed
<cowvarkian> for some reason
<Kakumy> I'll play Fallout 4 on my Alieware 51x
<killerpony7733> alienware oh god no
<Kakumy> The CPU is worth it...
<Kakumy> unless that giant ass one hell no..
<killerpony7733> Kakumy: You could still build something better then a alienware for less then what they charge you
<killerpony7733> But eh your choice though
<Malk> Its fallout new vegas it must be wrek streaming right?
<Kakumy> Not my money my parents money
<Bronysith> Kakumy: i dont care if fallout 4 has bad graphics. i just want a good game
<FlutterMEDIC> yep

<otakon17> Brb guys
<killerpony7733> Kakumy: Ouch for them
<Kakumy> Fallout 3 has the bunkers
<MadSurge> :O SELF DESTRUCTION
<FlutterMEDIC> RUN FOR YOUR LIFE
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: Same here, but most people like better graphics over a better story
<cowvarkian> so I hear
<FlutterMEDIC> i prefer story
<Malk> Oh is he blowing up the brotherhood?
<CCCP> hai :(
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: no. most assholes prefer better graphics than a better game
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo CCCP

<otakon17> Wrek wrecks the Nevada Wasteland
<killerpony7733> Dat pun
<FlutterMEDIC> when's the thing gonna blow?
<Kakumy> otakon17: his playing Fallout 3 dude...
<CCCP> Nevada already is a wastland
<MadSurge> Bronystate needs more "game nice guys" :D

<MadSurge> killerpony7733: me too
<Malk> Jingle Jangle
<cowvarkian> me too killerpony7733
<otakon17> Huffy the Kakumy
<CCCP> Kakumy *hugs*

*CCCP hugs killerpony7733

<Kandarihu> Man, I just had the craziest experience in PSO2 just now.
<Flyboy> jingle jangle!
<MadSurge> Whassup CCCP?
<otakon17> How so Kandarihu
<CCCP> MadSurge not much, you? :(
<FlutterMEDIC> all is ded in bunker
<MadSurge> CCCP: I need to shave tomorrow :D
<CCCP> MadSurge :3 oh
<Kakumy> Fallout is like Elder Scrolls but with guns :D
<cowvarkian> its exactly that now
<cowvarkian> sortof
<FlutterMEDIC> and flying robots
<killerpony7733> It's very far from that Kakumy
<killerpony7733> The first two games were different ALOT
<Kandarihu> Running the Caves, the Vol Dragon spawned and killed me quite easily. I pretty much filled my party with NPCs and died a few dozen times before the thing finally went down.
<Kakumy> killerpony7733: and some more other stuff
<cowvarkian> only it has more role playing elements then elder scrolls strangely...
<Vivix> Fallout is it's completely own thing. Comparing it to scrolls is a bit--silly
<cowvarkian> as far as I can tell
<Kakumy> Oh now I see Las Vegas
<CCCP> I HAVE NO FOOD :(
<Flyboy> New Vegas
<Flyboy> :)
<MadSurge> Kakumy: NEW Vegas, please :D
*MLP_Brovakiin Gives CCCP a muffin :3
<Kakumy> New Vegas, Las Vegas I say Fallout style or Real world style :P
<FlutterMEDIC> *dumps food into CCCP's inventory* here.
*CCCP nomz the entire Fucking muffin in one bite MLP_Brovakiin MOAR
<Kandarihu> I think the last Caves map is going to have the Vol Dragon as an end-boss, meaning that if I die and return to the campship, I have to start over from the beginning.
<Vivix> New Reno was--darker than New Vegas, but New Reno had no walls to protect it
*CCCP eats FlutterMEDIC
<FlutterMEDIC> *muffled* why?
*MLP_Brovakiin gives CCCP a muffin factory
<CCCP> MLP_Brovakiin yay!
<pony_4484> What game are they playing
*FlutterMEDIC teleports out of CCCP
<CCCP> FlutterMEDIC im just sooo hungry
<cowvarkian> new vegas pony_4484
<desertman2> 4484: Fallout: New Vegas
<pony_4484> ok
<DaringDerpy> I see you took the only reasonable choice. Kill Mr House and take New Vegas for yourself. :)
*Kakumy throws shit loads of muffins at CCCP

<Kakumy> Its raining muffins!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye pony_4484
<MadSurge> FlutterMEDIC: then I'll keep eating!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Alchemist: hahaha
<cowvarkian> hah Alchemist
<FlutterMEDIC> NOAW I THROW CUPCAKES INTO THE MIX! *cupcakes start falling along with the muffins*
<MadSurge> Alchemist: Ikr, food is meant to be eaten!
<DaringDerpy> http://captionsearch.com/pix/thumb/3ny5knu5n-t.jpg
<DaringDerpy> food
<cowvarkian> DaringDerpy: o u
<MLP_Brovakiin> Thats harsh
<CCCP> now these are just getting offensive
<Alchemist> never experienced the magix of a food fight yet. Might actually be good :D
<cowvarkian> funny to me
<Wrek> jsut gona find the dam
<Midnight> well paint chat is empty...
<alexxm> thats a big gun
<FlutterMEDIC> *muffins and cupcakes are still falling from the sky*
<DaringDerpy> dam is east
<desertman2> Near Boulder City, I think
<MirrorImage> Wrek - hell of a gun... you going to protect the president or do him in yourself?
<Midnight> Ikr. 0-0 you could kill godzilla wth that
<MLP_Brovakiin> Midnight: What is paint chat, I was thinking ablout checking it out
<Kakumy> http://dawnmistpony.deviantart.com/art/Littlepip-and-Homage-sculpt-303388052
<FlutterMEDIC> both...AT THE SAME TIME! :D
<Kakumy> Some of you might seen this pic
<Midnight> Its at the top
<Midnight> It says Paintchat
<Midnight> Its empty though
<MLP_Brovakiin> I know but what is it
<DaringDerpy> they are cute
<Midnight> well
<Midnight> you can draw
<Midnight> and chat
<VinylScrath_wubs> Hello everypony!!
<MLP_Brovakiin> do you jus draw shit
<CCCP> hi VinylScrath_wubs
<Kakumy> hey VinylScrath_wubs
<Midnight> hello vinyl
<Fisheh_Fish> Heya VinylScrath_wubs :)
<Alchemist> This is a weird soundtrack to murder wild animals to in the post apocalyptic desert...
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo VinylScrath_wubs
<FlutterMEDIC> hi VinylScrath_wubs
<VinylScrath_wubs> :D
<VinylScrath_wubs> hello
<CCCP> Alchemist i love it :D
<cowvarkian> its the radio man Alchemist
<cowvarkian> apparently broadcasting towers are still up
<Midnight> Dat music
<DaringDerpy> pop culture got stuck in the 50's forever
<Kakumy> Go find raiders and kill simple as that
<FlutterMEDIC> the thing just evaporated
<Midnight> :O
<StinkomanFan> Is that the Little MacIntosh mod?
<MirrorImage> StinkomanFan - no, i think that's just a plain .44
<Kakumy> StinkomanFan: thats the first thing you would think of no it just a Myterious Magnum
<Midnight> ^^ say i like trains and your screwed
<killerpony7733> StinkomanFan: I don't think wrek has any mods on
<MLP_Brovakiin> I never got fallout, If they where so advanced for a global thermonuclear war, then why did they go back to computers from the 50's
<Kandarihu> It's been 200 years.
<MirrorImage> MLP_Brovakiin - because EVERYTHING dun broke
<MirrorImage> nukes tend to break stuff
<cowvarkian> Midnight: I like trains
<Kakumy> nukes are like .... EMP
<FlutterMEDIC> except broadcasting towers :/
<desertman2> MLP_Brovakiin: It's 60's idea of the future
<DaringDerpy> well...they actually were ready for thermonuclear war in the 50s
<MirrorImage> FlutterMEDIC - not every broadcast tower is in a place of "tactical significance"
<Midnight> Cowvarkian: *Train runs you over* i warned you. :O
<CCCP> The 50's werent as good as the 60's
<DaringDerpy> they already had fusion bombs and neutron bombs at this point
<killerpony7733> MLP_Brovakiin: The idea was after WWII things wen't to hell and all, And alot of tech became advanced like alot of nuclear power and everything.
<CCCP> cus they didnt have Hippies
<MirrorImage> compare the desolation you see in towns like Washington DC to out-of-the-way locations like Novac here
<cowvarkian> they did too
<MirrorImage> Novac is a mess mostly from abandonment. DC is a mess because kaboom
<Dark_Horst> actually, the bombs in fallout fell in 2077
<Kakumy> Ok wait... Fallout New Vegas is ya placed at Vegas then what about Fallout 3?
<Spademagnes[R]> Hello everypony
<MirrorImage> Kakumy - Washington DC
<Dark_Horst> itÄS jsut that society somehow stuck in the 50s while technology kept advancing
<Kakumy> MirrorImage: wow...
<FlutterMEDIC> Hi Spademagnes[R]
<MirrorImage> hence, "Capital Wasteland"
<cowvarkian> technically DC should be a giant irradiated crater...
<Dark_Horst> Kakumy: washington dc
<CCCP> Anyway our entire culture for the past decade has been based arounf the internet and shitty memes :)
<Midnight> <Spademagnes[R]> hello
<FlutterMEDIC> HOLY BIG GUN
<Kakumy> hey Spademagnes[R]
<DaringDerpy> what is this? I want one :)
<Kakumy> THAT GUN
<Spademagnes[R]> Holy shit what is that
<cowvarkian> norly cccp
<Spademagnes[R]> What..is that
<MirrorImage> i think that's the Tesla Cannon
<Kakumy> Wrek gonna show off :P
<FlutterMEDIC> @Wrek what the heck is that
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: And nuclear tech became the most used type. And the managed to develop some advanced technology at all
<MLP_Brovakiin> TESLA CANNON :D
<CCCP> cowvarkian for the most part yesh
<killerpony7733> they*
<Spademagnes[R]> Where the hell did he get that?
<MirrorImage> Spademagnes[R] - a gift from the Brotherhood of Steel, as i recall
<Midnight> Dat bannon...
<cowvarkian> by gift, you mean stolen
<Midnight> *cannon
<FlutterMEDIC> holy
<Spademagnes[R]> Is it a part of a add on?
<MirrorImage> yes, judicial use of quotes when i say "gift"
<MirrorImage> Spademagnes[R] - don't think so
<Spademagnes[R]> Or is it in the main game?
<VinylScrath_wubs> Woah.
<MirrorImage> one sc
<killerpony7733> MirrorImage: Still a better and unique somewhere in the world that is like alot more power
<FlutterMEDIC> damn thing is a bazooka
<killerpony7733> powerful*
<MLP_Brovakiin> Spademagnes[R]: You find it in a crater with a crashed vertibird
<DaringDerpy> It takes some ammo
<cowvarkian> theres one in big mt too
<Spademagnes[R]> So what ammo does it take?
<Dark_Horst> the one at the vertibird is not the tesla cannon though
<Dark_Horst> it's the tesla beaton prototype
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Unique tesla cannon i short
<Dark_Horst> looks the same though, only orange
<killerpony7733> in*
<MLP_Brovakiin> oh
<Kakumy> out of no where flare gun
<VinylScrath_wubs> Whos the person playing the game?
<DaringDerpy> microfusion cell probably
<cowvarkian> wrek VinylScrath_wubs
<Dark_Horst> VinylScrath_wubs: wrek is
<Spademagnes[R]> Just ignore the big cannon
<VinylScrath_wubs> ah cool.
<Spademagnes[R]> I love how no one reacts to that
<Dark_Horst> ...at least i think
<Midnight> Lol
<VinylScrath_wubs> i need to get fallout.
<cowvarkian> pay no attention to the man beghind the curtain
<FlutterMEDIC> hard NOT to ignore it
<Dark_Horst> VinylScrath_wubs: yes, you do
<VinylScrath_wubs> XD
<VinylScrath_wubs> im gonna see how much it is on steam right now...
<cowvarkian> 3 dollars
<cowvarkian> times 20
<MirrorImage> VinylScrath_wubs - GOTY edition i believe is $20
<VinylScrath_wubs> oh
<MirrorImage> if we're talking FONY
<MirrorImage> FONV*
<cowvarkian> fallout new york
<MLP_Brovakiin> I am level 50 on new vegas, It kind bores me now :/
<MirrorImage> yes... great idea for Fallout 5... NEW YORK
<Dark_Horst> VinylScrath_wubs: i recommend fallout 3 first. did the whole wasteland athmosphere better. new vegas is pretty much western
<VinylScrath_wubs> well i have enough for that
<cowvarkian> that'd be cool
<desertman2> Ultimate is 30
<cowvarkian> MirrorImage: you mean fallout 4
<Spademagnes[R]> 20 seems a bit cheap
<MirrorImage> cowvarkian - New Vegas is "Fallout 4"
<Dark_Horst> VinylScrath_wubs: also, it's cheaper than new vegas d to coming out first^^
<VinylScrath_wubs> ya i played new vegas, mosy fun ive ever had
<cowvarkian> bah
<Flyboy> Fallout: new jersey
<FlutterMEDIC> lord, Jersey
<cowvarkian> fallout new vegas is just the odst of the franchise
<VinylScrath_wubs> ha that would be fun
<Flyboy> wont be many changes then
<cowvarkian> like a brotherhood of steel, or tactics
<VinylScrath_wubs> oh dude i hated halo odst
<Spademagnes[R]> I liked Odst
<FlutterMEDIC> what about Fallout: St. Louis?
<PillowPoni> Is this music part of the game?
<cowvarkian> its not a numbered game, so its not fallout 4
<Dragonmatte> Yeah, really not to par with the other ones, IMO :3
<Dragonmatte> Odst, that is
<cowvarkian> like fallout tactics or fallout brotherhood of steel
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, bunch of bronies started on a complete converdion mod to make fallout 3 into fallout ewuestria
<Kakumy> I feel like his ognna use that cannon to shoot at the president..
<Dark_Horst> monsterproject, that one
<Spademagnes[R]> So who is Wrek allied with?
<Dragonmatte> Fatman? :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> It is rumoured that the next fallout is in Boston
<desertman2> Spademagnes[R]: Yes Man
<FlutterMEDIC> NCR i thinl
<Kakumy> Dark_Horst: no point there's a project where their making an entire new game into F:E
<FlutterMEDIC> think*
<cowvarkian> wrek you do know that that sniper gets killed by a caesar's legion guy
<Spademagnes[R]> I went the Ncr route
<MirrorImage> Spademagnes[R] - himself. i believe he's on Yes Man's route
<Kakumy> Dark_Horst: no mods it's an entire game
<DaringDerpy> no spoilers
<Dark_Horst> Kakumy: that'S the one
<Spademagnes[R]> He's gonna shoot him
<cowvarkian> there we are
<Spademagnes[R]> A second sniped
<Spademagnes[R]> *sniper
<Kakumy> Dark_Horst: they still need lots of people dude...
<Dragonmatte> Why u no haz fatman? xD
<DaringDerpy> did he find all threats?
<MirrorImage> did the picture just freeze for anyone else, or is my computer just crap?
<Dark_Horst> Kakumy: total conversion devines as new game. they just keep the engine
<Flyboy> did it just freeze?
<Dark_Horst> *defines
<Wrek> damned chat lag
<DaringDerpy> mine froze too
<otakon17> No
<Dragonmatte> Oh, he's not killing him? :I
<desertman2> It just lost focus
<Flyboy> oh nvm

<VinylScrath_wubs> ii just wanna play 3 for now
<Flyboy> killerpony7733: good point. i geuss its just a good shape
<Flyboy> OH HELL YEAH
<cowvarkian> that's a change
<Spademagnes[R]> So whats the difference between New Vegas GOTY and Ultimate?
<FlutterMEDIC> YEAH BOY
<Kakumy> Vegas was released in 2008 but who cares still good game
<Kakumy> WOW THE MUSIC
<PillowPoni> How many people has Wrek killed today?
<DaringDerpy> I played this music for arma
<desertman2> Ultimate comes with all DLC
<pony_8042> 346
<cowvarkian> from songs written in the 20's to 30's to this
<killerpony7733> Kakumy: Series started back in the 90's and FO2 had the first vertibird
<Spademagnes[R]> Then what does GOTY have?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo PillowPoni
<desertman2> All DLC
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> Spademagnes[R]: all the add ons
<Kakumy> killerpony7733: though FO1 and 2 we're 2D
<PillowPoni> Hallo MLP_Brovakiin
<Spademagnes[R]> I'm confused
<desertman2> GotY is FO3, Ultimate is FO:NV
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> Kakumy: *were

<Spademagnes[R]> Whoops
<cowvarkian> Kakumy: werent they like, top down
<killerpony7733> Kakumy: So? still better then FO3 and to some point FO:NV
<Alchemist> Dragonmatte: nope, I think you hear the pings through the stream
<MadSurge> Dragonmatte: those are Wrek's pings
<Dragonmatte> Aha

<MirrorImage> "Don't mind me, just pointing my giant death gun at your face"

<killerpony7733> DaringDerpy: He was breaking a rule. Can i not be friendly enough to tell him that?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Shizuka: that rule is optional actually, but most of the time it is better to look away
<Kandarihu> Well, it's dangerous to REALLY ignore an explosion. But pretending to ignore it can still be cool.
<VinylScrath_wubs> he needs to walk away faciing the camera in slow motion while he puts on sunglasses with rainbow dash in the background
<DaringDerpy> killerpony7733: calm down :)
<BrOnyxia> nopony knows? well k

<cowvarkian> I know
<CCCP> Has Wrek ever drawn Fluttershy?

<CCCP> DaringDerpy i lol'd so hard :D
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: thumbs up!
*Dovah DoctoDoctorWho is useing italics
<MLP_Brovakiin> Just don't over use it :)
<MadSurge> ^
*cowvarkian got banned for that
<otakon17> Brn
<otakon17> Brb
*cowvarkian thinks the mods were overreacting, but whatever
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am, for one, glad that they enforce the rule
<cowvarkian> because apparently speaking in the third person whilst using italics is roleplaying
<RealVinylScrath_wubs> lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> I would not chat here if all I saw was...
*Barbetos|AtWork goes to the market to buy some apples
<Barbetos|AtWork> all the time
<Barbetos|AtWork> That would
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ugh
<DoctoDoctorWho> MLP_Brovakiin: but of course! this is the internet, where everyone is polite and holds to intelligent conversation!
<cowvarkian> barbetos, what rule?
<MLP_Brovakiin> DoctoDoctorWho: haha
<Barbetos|AtWork> cowvarkian no excessive rping
*CCCP sigh
<cowvarkian> Unless its the rule "rules are subject to change"
<FlutterMEDIC> DoctoDoctorWho but thats another world, where in this world we live with idiots
<Barbetos|AtWork> it gets annoying
<cowvarkian> ....
<cowvarkian> ok
<CCCP> I have somthing to do in 30 mins :(
<spitfirecolt2> wow wrek is awesomw at drawing
<RealVinylScrath_wubs> ikr?
<cowvarkian> so i guess speaking in third person somehow is rping
*Barbetos|AtWork having a conversation in italics is okay though
<Resonantwaves> cya later everyone! be back in a few :)
<FlutterMEDIC> bye Resonant
<RealVinylScrath_wubs> bye!!
<spitfirecolt2> see ya waves

<Athgaar> otp
<Chrysalis> Wrek how should we take that?
<Alchemist> Lil_B come over to the surface chemistry side. its really hip nowdays :D
<cowvarkian> doubtful
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I kinda knew how Wrek looked, his OC pony looks a lot like him :D
<Lil_B> Chrysalis it's just something I noticed XD not insulting/complimenting anyone
<Lil_B> Invi|colt I have no idea honestly ... I wish I could just become a Beamter at our local waterresorvoir and do that for the rest of my live :P
<Invi|colt> Lil_B, then i would loose all respect I ever had :D
<Lil_B> Alchemist what exactly is surface chemistry?
<Invi|colt> Lil_B, i meant you would loose it ^^
<rickashay19> hey guys does anybody know what there showing for movie night
<Invi|colt> Lil_B, mit Lotus effect unn so zeug. versiegelungen etc glaub ich
<Invi|colt> dat The_Browncoat
<Invi|colt> dat TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Alchemist> Lil_B: it deals with dispersions, adsorptions on surfaces, nano technology, optical/electronic properties etc
<Lil_B> Invi|colt whats so wrong about beeing a Beatmter XD

<Lil_B> Invi|colt well, I ask you XD why would I loose your respect?
<MadSurge> These songs sound really sad :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo kirzstryfe and TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Alchemist> Lil_B: basically if a system contains small nano scale particles, their surface becomes so soignificant that they will have special properites and thats what we are researching.
<AJIsAwesome> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Good afternoon!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe seems like adobe ilustrator
<Invi|colt> Lil_B, well all Beamten i know don't deserve my respect ^^

<mitamaking> That cutie mark
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Applelicious
<MadSurge> Alchemist: so it's not just a nick! :D Is your cutie mark a test tube?
<Lil_B> Alchemist oh, I think I get it now, I would actually really like to work in research, it's more interesting
<Golakka> I need this program for making things :D
<MuffinNuffin> Hai everyone
<mitamaking> Does that say appleicious?
<Invi|colt> Lil_B, because they get money for actually not working. we even have to pay them to make a copy xD
<MuffinNuffin> who's streaming?
<Alchemist> Madsruge: yes my nick is not a coincidence :d But I dont have an OC though. If I had, I think the for elements would be more fitting.
<MadSurge> MuffinNuffin: our mod Wrek is
<Alchemist> *four
<AJIsAwesome> MuffinNuffin: Hello! Wrek is.
<MuffinNuffin> Hai AJIsAwesome

<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: It's Wrek drawing.
<MuffinNuffin> ya
<mitamaking> MuffinNuffin: I know but I want to be surprised
<Alchemist> Lil_B: and by making tests you mean you throw the smaple in the IR spectrophotometer, automatic titrator and wait for the comp to spit out the results :D
<Lil_B> Invi|colt well, the only thing I could potentionaly take money from you is when you try to get a tour XD otherwise there is nothing there anyway
<MuffinNuffin> MuffinNuffin: Yea but if anyone answered, technicly it would be their fault for spoiling it XD
<Lil_B> Alchemist yes :P maybe a HPLC too

<cowvarkian> I think I would be a cmc....
<cowvarkian> or just a nerd
<cowvarkian> I'm good at that

<PillowPoni> Fl00tersh41: Even though Malfoy was given ample warning to not anger the thing, he did it anyway because he's Malfoy. Now that it attacked him, he got his father involved in it. And the Minister of Magic.

<Fl00tersh41> PillowPoni: So it's perfectly ok if the big predator mauls any student who doesn't get it's specific greeting right
<ShadowQuill> Just dropped in to give you a Lion King reference
<Major> Silverscreen: ah now I remember! :D
<otakon> Even in his sleep Ron has the most slappable of faces.

<Silverscreen> 1,11Shizuka: http://i556.photobucket.com/albums/ss5/j004y/over20your20head.jpg
<desertman2> Riders: It's a secret to everybody
<Quick_Thinker> by super mega bitch
<otakon> Silverscreen: lol
<PillowPoni> Fl00tersh41: I'm not saying that but Malfoy was told by Hagrid himself to not antagonize Buckbeak. If he had listened and not been his usual smart-assed self Buckbeat wouldn't be getting executed
<FlutterMEDIC> right over the head
<PonyStationVita> animal crossing isnt that coming on 3ds
<Tovler> Pudge: since 2008
<Pudge> Mods are going to troll us by streaming new born cuties for 5 hours

<Fl00tersh41> PillowPoni: No, the problem is that Hagrid is introducing school children to daangerous predators
<otakon> DESTROY US ALL! DESTROY US ALL! DESTROY US ALL! DESTROY US ALL!
<linsett> Btw guys what's playing on Movie Night tonight?

*PillowPoni ties Pudge to a chair and places duct tape over his/her mouth "Shhh I'm doing this for your own good"
<fluttercry> 05,15We could stream my reading John Galt's speech. That should take up at least one movie slot
<alexxm> sounds normal to me my mum does that all the time
<Slowter> That crytstal ball is definitly strong to survive going down stone stairs
<Pudge> LOL
<otakon> linsett: no idea, tis a mystery
<Eulshy> Quick_Thinker, good book
<Quick_Thinker> boring
<Quick_Thinker> as
<Tovler> Atlas Shrugged raises some very good points
<Quick_Thinker> hell
<Major> XD
<otakon> brb gotta finish making tea
<linsett> otakon crap
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: aww but then Meanwhile wouldn't get to see it
<Shizuka> 13fluttercry: there's a series of youtube videos reading the speech at normal speed... it's still like five hours
<Fl00tersh41> PillowPoni: It's not the fault of the child who got mauled, it's the teachers responsibility
<Pudge> and instead of pony eps we are going to watch telletubbies
<Eulshy> Quick_Thinker, really i rather liked that book
<Count-Bleck> nice filters
<Shizuka> 13skip past galt's speech when you get bored of it, but the rest of the book is quite solid
<PonyStationVita> omg wdf is this fuckness
<FlutterMEDIC> Pudge: Enough! NO
<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: sounds legit
<linsett> pudge What!?!
<Pudge> I'm so evillll!
<XAXzzz> >one speech

<Xaiphafonese> my smokes...could you had them to me harry?
<XAXzzz> >5 hours
<XAXzzz> wuuuut
<PillowPoni> Fl00tersh41: Yet Dumbledore allowed this, considering the kind of creatures Hagrid deals with.
<Spademagnes[R]> Fl00tersh41: Well the ass decided to annoy the thing even though Haggrid said NOT to get near it
<Unnr> Atlas Shrugged is a decent book, but isn´t the best illustration of Objectivism, even if its held up as such, We the People or The Fountainhead is better in that regard. But the movie was pretty meh.
<fluttercry> 05,15lol. Now I actually want to do that.
<Silverscreen> 1,11It's official: Sheetz M*T*O is awesome.
<Pudge> Dont hurt me!

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Y so Sirius?
<CriticKitten> What with the cat transformation and the howling to attract the werewolf?
<otakon> CriticKitten: she's not a furry

<NocturnalBlade> bacon is best food
<PillowPoni|Cooking> AJIsAwesome: yes. It's called the Dementor's Kiss
<Fl00tersh41> otakon: Not if you send them to the big iceshelves that need to be kept from thawing
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Duh

<otakon> :D
<Tovler> That was a fun fact
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> so after you have no memories or hapiness left does your soul get taken then?
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> suck

<AJIsAwesome> FAINT COU- Oh, you beat me to the punch.:D
<Slowter> "No I'm herminoe"
<CriticKitten> ...LOL
<Obsidian> AJIsAwesome: Mopre like a more powerful version of thier kiss
<Sundaysmile> It's Santa!
<FlutterMEDIC> yep
<Pudge> not just any punch
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> every book winds up with Harry Potter in the hospital
<Count-Bleck> saved by the patronum
<Shizuka> 13harry potter and the last crusade
<Xaiphafonese> so does his patronus prove hes a HORNY teen?
<Major> XD
<Pudge> this aint your mothers punch
<FlutterMEDIC> AJIsAwesome: yes i did XD
<Count-Bleck> two and a half
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> 1, 2, this one, the next one, 5, 6, even
<Slowter> Dumbledoor is a dick
<MLP_Brovakiin> what a jerk
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> every single book has Harry wind up in the hospital
<AJ> troll dumbledoor
<Flutter_shy> He like's dick's that's for sure...
<Count-Bleck> 7 not
<Sundaysmile> Rowling is a sadist
<Sergio_Scriptor> SeaponiesofLiverpool: you already sais that :)
<Shizuka> 13unless dumbledore can sense stable time loops, he had this planned very early on
<Slowter> Maybe he just hates gingers
<AJIsAwesome> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Every book has Harry fainting.:D
<Shizuka> 13what with stalling the executioner
<Count-Bleck> that's true
<Marky> Muffins! :P
<Fisheh_Fish> Gud luck
<GarrettBrony> muffins?6_9
<Tovler> Maybe it's Maybelline
<Count-Bleck> what if dumbledore is the doctor?
<PonyStationVita> Muffins>Cupcakes
<Sumica> 00,10and ron voiced what we all though
<FlutterMEDIC> DID SOMEPONY SAY MUFFINS? *muffins start falling from the sky*
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Roxy Lalonde = Berry Punch
<fluttercry> 05,15wow
<Shizuka> 13i love the kid being wrapped up in bandages there
<AJIsAwesome> She must've borrowed that from Starswirl the Bearded.
*Bronysith|DnDarksoul glomps into Sumica
<Sergio_Scriptor> dumbledore changed acent for a micro-second :D
<Xaiphafonese> great save everyone AND have to draw my footsteps again? wizzarding bites
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> I am back from dark souls
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Bronyshit
<RaveBrony> Oh god :D
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> well how is it
<FlutterMEDIC> Bronysith* XD
<GarrettBrony> :P i love muffins
<Sergio_Scriptor> welcome back Bronysith :)
<Count-Bleck> oh God masturbation
<Fisheh_Fish> Lol
<Sundaysmile> lol Bronyshit
<fluttercry> 05,15So how come they never use the time turner again?
<Shizuka> 13MYST REFERENCE
<Rustymeat> Is dark sould out on PC yet?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Hermoany
<Shizuka> 13mein heart~<3
<PonyStationVita> muffins pwns cupcakes
<Chrysalis> fluttercry time laws
<Chrysalis> also
<FlutterMEDIC> so much fail on my part
<GarrettBrony> I love Myst
<Chrysalis> Dr Whooves got involved
<Count-Bleck> it's handled to mcgonnagal in the end, and they break all the other ones in the 5th movie
<CriticKitten> fluttercry: Because that would make the story too easy
<Slowter> A lot can go wrong when you time travel
<Obsidian> fluttercry: look at the HISHE
<fluttercry> 05,15But it's so usefull....they could just go back and fix ANY mistake
<Sergio_Scriptor> :D
<Major> fluttercry: because the writers were too stupid to write it in the script again :D
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Hermoine: Dave Strider's mom
<Sumica> 00,10lol
<Tovler> FIRST
<Shizuka> 13fluttercry: part of it is that it creates stable time loops
<GarrettBrony> Chrysalis well David tenant did appear in the next movie
<Spademagnes[R]> Crow knows all about time travel
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Paradoxes?
<PsychoticDoc> whats with the narrator dude
<EonMaster> the timeturners got destroyed when the death eaters attacked the ministry
<Count-Bleck> good punch
<Count-Bleck> thanks
<Shizuka> 13so the fact that [insert event we're supposed to fix] happened means that no time travel was used
<kirzstryfe> but fluttercry, what if you go back in time to kill yourself before you go bacck in time?
<Spademagnes[R]> How did she not cause any time paradoxes using this?
<Eulshy> fluttercry, go back and smother child voldemort with a pillow
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: IKR?:D
<Shizuka> 13since you'll notice the first time we saw this scene, you don't ACTUALLY see the executioner behead buckbeak
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> i like how you can hear the stop watch still ticking
<Sumica> 00,10still say she should be 3 years older
<Sergio_Scriptor> Spademagnes[R]: magic :)
<fluttercry> 05,15oh yeah...
<Spademagnes[R]> What is a stable time loop?
<FlutterMEDIC> too time philosophy here
<Flutter_shy> Becuase it would make the rest of the movie's pointless.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> How Harry Potter 7 should have ended
<desertman2> That's probably why they don't have time travel after this
<Major> fluttercry: oh and if they went back to when voldermort attacked Harry they would have to wait years to get back to their time :P
<fluttercry> 05,15Only a few more movies Sumica
<Count-Bleck> buckbeak
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6529757184 BANE as a TSA agent
<Fl00tersh41> fluttercry: Go back and beat up Voldemort while he was still a little kid?
<Chrysalis> Shizuka yup, you just hear the THUD of the axe hittin the fence
<Sumica> 00,10no i meen she is liveing every day like 3 times
<Shizuka> 13a stable time loop is one theory of time travel where all travel takes place in, and modifies, the same universe timeline
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Snape already did it
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> great pumpkin :D
<Chrysalis> i hope the executioner paid for that damage
<alexxm> why did they never use timeturners to go back in time and kill voldemort when he wasn't as powerful
<PillowPoni|Cooking> Hello Phase4
<otakon> Sumica: yeah that's why she's so haggard this term
<Count-Bleck> heloooooooooooo
<Spademagnes[R]> So the event that changes wont cause a paradox?
<Shizuka> 13we see harry get hit with a rock and the executioner hit something, and hear someone go awooooooo later
<Major> Charlie Brown reference <3
<Phase4> 00,02morning
<Sergio_Scriptor> alexxm: plot convinience
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: Paradox?
<Shizuka> 13we find that harry and hermione traveled back in time to cause those events
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Phase4
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Phase4 :)
<FlutterMEDIC> SPOILER ALERT
<Shizuka> 13because things progressed relatively safely, there's only one timeline
<Fisheh_Fish> Heya Phase4
<Spademagnes[R]> How did she not fuck up reality at this point?
<otakon> dat snail
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Phase4
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Phase4
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYWT5Q_R_w see?
<Count-Bleck> oh
<PillowPoni|Cooking> Spademagnes[R]: I'm sure McGonagall and Dumbledore warned her of the risks
<Spademagnes[R]> It got felt across time
<Count-Bleck> that hurt
<otakon> SeaponiesofLiverpool: no video links please
<Shizuka> 13Spademagnes[R]: that's part of what makes it a stable time loop, if they had done something that prevents them from later time travelling (say, killing themselves), then you'd have a problem
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Snape went back in time at the end of #7 and killd Voldemort
<kirzstryfe> so the executioner hit harry with a rock and he went "awooooooo" ?
<Spademagnes[R]> THE POWER OF TIME TRAVEL
<Bronysith> otakon: my brain hurts now
<GarrettBrony> Spademagnes[R] no its the power of love
<Count-Bleck> is he a final fantasy villain?
<Shizuka> 13but because they do things in such a way that past!Harry and past!Hermione safely get to the hospital wing and can travel, the loop is stable
<Sundaysmile> lol
<Spademagnes[R]> God this is more convoluted than Sonic 06 time travel, but thats just me talking out of my ass...
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Threshexcutioner
<desertman2> Just assume things happen as they happen
<Sumica> 00,10is my ass realy that big?
<kirzstryfe> stable loops are no fun, no universal implosion, no time rifts, pfft
<Pyroid> ths JOJ
<Shizuka> 13compare back to the future where every time travel backwards creates a new universe and timeline
<Bronysith> Sumica: yes
<Sundaysmile> CAW!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Hermoine knows what's going on
<FlutterMEDIC> caws everywhere
<Tovler> !
<Sergio_Scriptor> Shizuka: i call that the multiverse :)
<Count-Bleck> crows
<Matt> So what movie is playing tonight?
<Spademagnes[R]> So a stable time loop is changes in the past that doesnt affect the timeline too much
<FlutterMEDIC> Matt: we dont know
<PitViper> So basically Snake in Metal Gear 4
<Shizuka> 13there, because old!Biff takes grey's almanac back, and marty and doc are travelers, they're all shunted sideways into 1985A for evil biff, and can go back to correct it
<Major> Shizuka: but what about when Hermonie goes back in time to get to class and such?
<Unnr> in b4 hackers
<Count-Bleck> Sergio_Scriptor: do you know which movie it's coming tonight?
<Shizuka> 13when really they're just making more timelines
<Pyroid> Solid Snake with arthritis and a bad back... :)
<PonyStationVita> ni snake in mgs1
<GarrettBrony> tom servo .... CROWS
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> must have stable time loops or dead daves start piling up
<Sergio_Scriptor> Count-Bleck: nope
<Shizuka> 13for hermione, she's been leaving stable time loops all over the place this year
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> dead daves are the enemy
<kirzstryfe> a stable time loop is one where whatever you do has already been done by you, so your actions have absolutely no effect on the timeline
<otakon> Shizuka: eeyup
<Spademagnes[R]> Why did they give hermione this time device?
<Count-Bleck> Sergio_Scriptor: Will you stay here for the movie?
<otakon> DEAD FERRET!
<Fisheh_Fish> Lol
<Sergio_Scriptor> Count-Bleck: of course :)
<otakon> yummy
<Slowter> Except for the first time you did them
<AJIsAwesome> kirzstryfe: Thanks for clarifying that.
<Count-Bleck> just so she could all those classes
<Unnr> Spademagnes[R]: So she could take a few extra classes
<Shizuka> 13she's present for some class, then appears in the other classes, and since she never encounters herself and doesn't do any interference, the loops are stable and she exists in both places at once
<otakon> ferrety
<thelonepony> Dubbletroll
<otakon> shenanigans
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka you think these things out don't you?
<Shizuka> 13ron notices her every single time, with his "did you see her come in" lines over the course of the film
<Obsidian> ah the smell of time travel
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Terezidore?
<otakon> fluttercry: she is all knowing
<Major> Shizuka: but then wouldnt theyre be three of her then?
<kirzstryfe> but Slowter, if it's a stable time loop, there is no first time, because you already did what you needed to do when you did it, or there'd be no loop for you to not change in the first place
<LunarSS> but dont they have to do all this stuff for them to go back in time in the fisrt place
<FlutterMEDIC> SO MUCH TIME PHILOSOPHY
<Slowter> That hurts my brain kirzstryfe
<otakon> Meanwhile
<kirzstryfe> ^_^
<otakon> a large brandy
<SquedxLovesCazowl> wow an advert of a dating sight poped up
<Spademagnes[R]> Dumbletroll
<kirzstryfe> glad to help
<SquedxLovesCazowl> nice tits
<Shizuka> 13Major: at a given time yes, but the duplicates then end up traveling backwards until finally just one of her leaves the loop and continues forward in time
<Count-Bleck> Sergio_Scriptor: Will you go to facebook?
<PillowPoni|Cooking> Meanwhile
<otakon> hiya kirzstryfe
<Eulshy> screw time
<Spectrum_Rush> Dumbledore like to get his Drunk on
<Sergio_Scriptor> Count-Bleck: probably not :\
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> dead daves are the enemy
<Spademagnes[R]> So how does she avoid running into herself all this time?
*Bronysith glomps into kirzstryfe
<PonyStationVita> smashing pumpkins
<FlutterMEDIC> PUMKIN IS DED
<Count-Bleck> >_>
<Major> Shizuka: so this is pretty much a giant loop?
<otakon> GET TO KILLING HITLER!
<PillowPoni|Cooking> Just as I said that, he goes offline on Skype.
<fluttercry> 05,15haha
<Spademagnes[R]> That pumpkin wont be hungry anymore
<Flutter_shy> She plan's out her route's
<MLP_Brovakiin> Lets kill hitler!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Hoofler
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> shes only one day in time she probely remembers where shes been

<Fez_Quick_Thinker> definitly getting better at my puns
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Sergio_Scriptor AJIsAwesome AdamTheDuck thelonepony :)
<Shizuka> 13Major: basically picture time as a literal line, you have original harry and hermione from all history, they enter the loop as hermione decks malfoy
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Harry is his own dad.... I sense time travel shenanigans
<fluttercry> 05,15also I believe the year at this time is 1995
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: ssimple, killing Hitler makes him a Matyr
<Malk> Major why not? everyone should have candy in their back pockets just incase
<FlutterMEDIC> i wish i had Chaos Swiss Roll
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: not if you do it BEFORE his rise to power...like say when he's 10
<Shizuka> 13after aaaall the stuff, harry and hermione A travel back in time to form harry and hermione B, existing in the line with harry and hermione A
<Sundaysmile> Undivided flavour
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> HOWLmoine
<Major> Malk: but we dont wear pants....
<PonyStationVita> wheres shadow when need a swiss roll
<Spademagnes[R]> So that was that noise
<Phase4> 00,02i wonder if wizards have ever gone to space
<Sergio_Scriptor> otakon: you could also killing him while he was at world war 1 :P
<thelonepony> SPAAAACCCCEE
<Tovler> but HP5 had flat screens, 00's style clothes and such
<Shizuka> 13they do this stuff and get back to the hospital wing just as harry and hermione A travel back
<Major> Shizuka: Ill just refer to Back to the Future logic :D
<Spademagnes[R]> THIS IS SO CONVOLUTED
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: theres still repercussions that can come up
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> no they just die
<otakon> Sergio_Scriptor: no, he can fight back better then
<Shizuka> 13harry and hermione B (though really they're all the same) continue time forever
<PonyStationVita> oh great scoot
<Malk> Major ok if we dont wear pants and dont have pockets where do we put our wallets?

<GarrettBrony> otakon then I wouldn't have to kill him
<PillowPoni|Cooking> SuperBrony64, why are you naked??
<PillowPoni|Cooking> SuperBrony64: Wrong movie btw
<otakon> GarrettBrony: true
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> and the toothpaste is the patronus
<Tovler> Ginger-vitus? *me uses this later as an insult*
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> is he getting his memory sucked out since they both feel pain at the same time

<Spademagnes[R]> Wait so how the hell did he get here to begin with?
*PillowPoni|Cooking wraps a towel around SuperBrony64 while giving him a hug and a filly Fluttershy
<SuperBrony64> Harry used Flash...it's very effective!
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> so when harry A passout does harry B as well?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> so what movie at 7?
<Tovler> LED is the way to go
<PillowPoni|Cooking> Hi Thrackerzod
<CriticKitten> There's no way Harry shouldn't have been able to see himself from that distance across a small pond. >_>
<thelonepony> ha yah Thrackerzod
<Major> They'll return, and in greater numbers
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> can we have another Rifftraxs one?
<Spectrum_Rush> Malk: MY DAD IS DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Spectrum_Rush smacks Malk
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> MY DAD IS ME?
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Thrackerzod
<Sumica> 00,10time loops how do they work.
<Slowter> He's not really that bumbed that his dad is still dead
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Harry ....and his mom?
<PillowPoni|Cooking> How did nobody hear their screaming?
<PonyStationVita> oh great scott
<otakon> Sumica: like magnets
<Silverscreen> 1,11BOMBARDA!
<Flutter_Shy> So he saw himself, does that mean he broke the space time continum thingy?
<Spademagnes[R]> So what are you getting your parents for chrismass?
<Sergio_Scriptor> PillowPoni|Cooking: magic :)
<Eulshy> KA-BOOM
<otakon> PillowPoni|Cooking: bc of the Dementors
<Silverscreen> 1,11Fuck other college students. The fire alarm went off again. -_-
<Slowter> Not so Flutter_Shy, because he thought he saw his father
<desertman2> Flutter_Shy: He didn't know it was himself
<Thrackerzod> wut movie?
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> oh hi Trackerzod how is being a regualt pony?
<SuperBrony64> OMG SIRIUS BLACK VERSION
<Major> Sumica: reffer to Back To The Future :D
<Fl00tersh41> So thet way these stable time loops work, you could learn a powerful time traveling spell from your future self?
<GarrettBrony> yeh haa
<AJIsAwesome> Flutter_Shy: It only breaks if the past sees the future.
<otakon> Silverscreen: not good
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> in an alt. timeline Harry and Hermoine are Harry's parents
*Spectrum_Rush shudders
<Malk> Spectrum_Rush so is harries
<Shizuka> 13Major: well see back to the future has no loops
<otakon> okay brb gotta feed the pooch
<GarrettBrony> my eyes
<Sergio_Scriptor> SeaponiesofLiverpool: :O
<PonyStationVita> great scott
<Sumica> 00,10but how did harry from the future save harry from the past from death.
<Fl00tersh41> And latter you just go back in time and teach yourself the time traveling spell
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> just like Naruto is his own dad
<SuperBrony64> Harry...will you do me the honor of marrying me?
<Count-Bleck> Sergio_Scriptor: I think I'll go now
<Spademagnes[R]> Sumica: Thats a good point
<Spectrum_Rush> Malk: and does that make it better?, let me answer that... NO!!!!!!!!
<Fl00tersh41> The spell you learned from your future self...
<Shizuka> 13it's entirely new universes coming into being, original!Marty, Doc, Jennifer, and Einstein just get carried through the new universes because of the ripple effect and they are travelers
<Xaiphafonese> Shizuki except for loop holes
<Sergio_Scriptor> Count-Bleck: ok,see you tomorow :)
<Tovler> I thought Tobi was Naruto's dad
<Spademagnes[R]> How the hell did Harry get saved from him self before he went back in time?
<PonyStationVita> lol to the commentator
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what movie at 7?
<SuperBrony64> When did Hagrid lose all that weight?
<Bronysith> Tovler: FOOL even i know that narutos dad is the 4th hokage
<Sergio_Scriptor> Spademagnes[R]: it's a paradox
<Flutter_Shy> Yeah, but technically he realises he saw himself, so even though it wasn't immediate he still saw himself
<desertman2> Spademagnes[R]: Don't think about it
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, SuperBrony64!
<Shizuka> 13HI HO BUTTSTEAK, AWAAAAAAY!
<desertman2> Loops break when you do it
<Sergio_Scriptor> Spademagnes[R]: it's a paradox,and a time loop
<SuperBrony64> Hai AJIsAwesome :D
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Naruto time travels and becomes his dad
<MadSurge> Uuuuh, gotta go to bed... will you guys repeat the mystery movies tomorrow?
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: every possible outcome and scenerio exists
<Spademagnes[R]> I am so confused
<Count-Bleck> ahem
<PonyStationVita> ikr
<Shizuka> 13Spademagnes[R]: that's why it's a stable time loop, timetraveler!Harry was there from the start, that's what makes it a loop
<Flutter_Shy> MadSurge: Hey ^^
<Eulshy> dead ferrets
<Spademagnes[R]> This is more convoluted than Sonic 06
<Sergio_Scriptor> MadSurge: well bye Surge,also i think not :\
<Major> And we NEVER see BuckBeak again! :D
<SuperBrony64> Chrono Trigger...the movie?
<Count-Bleck> I'll be waiting for the couple boning in the creditgs
<PonyStationVita> but its no use!
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: wat?
<alexxm> imax shot
<SuperBrony64> Bronysith: Super Nintendo o3o
<Sumica> 00,10but how did the loop start.
<Shizuka> 13see and there go harry and hermione A
<SuperBrony64> I'll bbl ^-^
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> did waht?
<Fisheh_Fish> Nawww, Dumbledore isn't creepy at all
<Shizuka> 13harry and hermione B have completed their mission and will continue in time from here
<Flutter_Shy> MadSurge: <---- SnowyFluttershy
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> did wat
<P4ngya> it never started and it will never end
<Spademagnes[R]> And so reality exploded
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Dumbletroll
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sumica: it didn't it's a time loop :|
<Slowter> We teleported Ron
<Shizuka> 13the thing about stable time loops is they don't start
<PonyStationVita> lol if its Mortal Kombat ill do a shit fatility
<Spademagnes[R]> Fucking trolls
*Spectrum_Rush DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE A HEADACHE AT THIS POINT?
<Spademagnes[R]> Shizuka: They never end?
<Count-Bleck> You cruel idiot
<Shizuka> 13it's not like BTTF where everything starts with marty screwing up his parents' meeting
<RaveBrony> Rofl :D
<Sumica> 00,10ron you are a wizzard and you are freaked out by teliportation.
<Shizuka> 13the loop will always exist at that point
<CriticKitten> Satan's birthday! :D
<Count-Bleck> lupin's quitting
<Flutter_Shy> I AM A LAMPOST
<RaveBrony> :D
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> none
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: So the only way they wouldn't completed their mission is if they went back in time again?
<Sergio_Scriptor> did i heard "sacked" ?
<AJIsAwesome> *wouldn't have*
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> whatever happened to Percy?
<Shizuka> 13if harry and hermione B had gone back in time again, *eventually* they would catch up to where harry and hermione A left
<Reactor> Hello, everyone
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> in the movies
<Silverscreen> 1,11Lupin's great werewolf sack.
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Reactor :)
<Count-Bleck> Sergio_Scriptor: BloomxTiara if you know what I mean

<pony_3738> ?
<Fisheh_Fish> Hey Reactor how are you?
<CriticKitten> SeaponiesofLiverpool: He went on to star in his own movie in which his father was Zeus and kind of a dick
<Spademagnes[R]> Shizuka: So the loop continues forever?
<Shizuka> 13you can jump back in time to any point, but you can only go into the future at a rate of one second per second
<Reactor> I'm doing great!
<Sergio_Scriptor> Count-Bleck: i know :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> wizard = need wands..... Sorceror = no wands
<Sumica> 00,10there is a PMS joke there Fl00tersh41
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Sorcerors > Wizards
<Count-Bleck> Sergio_Scriptor: litter
<Flutter_Shy> Shizuka: Where are you gettikng this information?
<Fl00tersh41> Sumica: That too

<Silverscreen> 1,11I'd like to think that sorcerors DO exist in the world of Harry Potter. They can perform the exact same magic, but they're much, much less powerful than wizards since they don't have a magical element to aid them.

<alexxm> how've things been Saturn
<Flutter_Shy> Shizuka: Why try to make so much sense out of it? It's just a movie...
<oni_link> hi Saturn :)
<PillowPoni|Cooking> Saturn: Yaaaay~
<NocturnalBlade> Saturn: yay!
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: HORRAY!
<fluttercry> 05,15yaaaay Saturn
<Silverscreen> 1,11Either that or sorcerors are actually wizards that have a talent for doing magic without a wand.
<Shizuka> 13because time travel
<Saturn> 08,01because i'm stuck at work while i bring some nodes up
<Shizuka> 13the best fiction is the fiction that's internally consistent
<spitfirecolt> ya we got saturn tonite the circle is complete
<Major> Saturn: finally, so how bout a Chrysalis Snow Globe? :P
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: like Past Sins!
*Saturn 08,01runs

<Saturn> 08,01it's 11:40pm for me right now, and i'm still at work
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi sub06905 :)
<Shizuka> 13or say mass effect, everything is derived from "here is a thing that, given a charge, changes mass within a field"
<Chrysalis> Saturn WHYYYYY
<sub06905> yes just in time for the rifftrax credits :P
<AJIsAwesome> All we're missing is Nittany_Discord and the circle is complete.
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: because servers
<Fl00tersh41> One thing that all ways bugged me in the Potter movies, mind control
<Flutter_Shy> Shizuka: Even so, if you have made sense of something fictional, and it's internally consistent, you just ruined countless movie's or show's.
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, to be fair that would break physics prety througherly
<Bronysith> oy Chrysalis how are you? forgot to say hi today
<Chrysalis> Saturn ouch, i thought still unpacking at this time was bad
<Sabershy> Don't forget SuperBrony64
<Shizuka> 13well yes
<AJIsAwesome> And SuperBrony64.
<Fl00tersh41> They have a forbidden spell that can do this
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what movie at 7?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: what do you mean ?
<Eulshy> screw physics
<Chrysalis> Bronysith im pretty good, still feelin wierd bout the move
<Flutter_Shy> It's 23:43 here
<Chrysalis> but im here in manchester now :D
<Xaiphafonese> time travel alone breaks reality
<Fl00tersh41> But they also teach school children to make potions that do similar things
<Sumica> 00,10says the guy who uses 50 fins on a rocket in place of a parachute Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02heck, if we had 'eee-zooo' we'd be in space right now
<PonyStationVita> uh time paradoxes
<Fl00tersh41> Love potions namely
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: okay then. i have no idea what movie it is, i just finished 12 consecutive hours of dark souls
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Evening ponies
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, >_>
<Sergio_Scriptor> Xaiphafonese: not if the multiverse theory is real :)
<NocturnalBlade> evening PaladinDrakkenwolf
<Michael> hai PaladinDrakkenwolf
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, worked didnt it
<Flutter_Shy> Hey PaladinDrakkenwolf
<Shizuka> 13take The Core for instance, unobtanium converts heat/pressure into electrical energy, except that would mean they'd burn through their coolant damn fast because the heat can't go anywhere but into the shell
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm the only one with no idea what movies are to be show today ?
<AJIsAwesome> PaladinDrakkenwolf: Hello!:)
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> OH GOD I MISSED ANOTHER RIFFTRAX??!!!!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> sumica what movies tonight
<Xaiphafonese> fair enough
<NocturnalBlade> PaladinDrakkenwolf: yeeea XD
<Fl00tersh41> So what is the wizard worlds position on using mind altering magic on others without their consent?
<fluttercry> 05,15It's a mystery
<Shizuka> 13ignore the part about stopping the core of the earth, even the most basic macguffin in that film was broken
<fluttercry> 05,15on purpose
<Pyroid> what's the movie?
<AJIsAwesome> PaladinDrakkenwolf: Yeah....
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> we canz have more rifftraxs?
<Sumica> 00,10wait and see
<Pyroid> up next?
<Shizuka> 13here, the time travel is consistent
<Chrysalis> Shizuka depends how quick it absorbs heat
<kirzstryfe> riiiiiight
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> NEIN
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> tell us
<Bronysith> Sumica: no. the movie is [bronystate gold] remember?
<fluttercry> 05,15<.<
<PonyStationVita> patience people
<Saturn> 08,01so what are we watching this week?
*kirzstryfe hugs fluttercry <3
<Shizuka> 13well they're down there for hours and hours
<Chrysalis> but then, surely it would suck all the heat from the people
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, or the part where there's no energy in static preasure
<Saturn> 08,01because i'm too lazy to check
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Flutter_Shy> But... IT'S A MOVIE!!! :(
<PonyStationVita> PATIENCE
<alexxm> Fl00tersh41 a spell like that is conserded unforgivable if i remember right
<Michael> ^
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> did you pick from the previous lottery?
<Eulshy> What are you colorful people even talking about?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> that would make sense
*Sergio_Scriptor is a bronystate silver member
