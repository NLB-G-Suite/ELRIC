<Ssargon> Because Nest is gone
<HyperMetalLugia> <HML> Been safe for over >30mins
<HyperMetalLugia> <HML> Not exactly
<HyperMetalLugia> <HML> But the host for the server was acting up
<Ssargon> I make theories. None are ever right. So there.
<Sakuya> its been working fine since nest was disconnected
<HyperMetalLugia> <HML> No resolvves for the IP
<Sakuya> All this is new

<HyperMetalLugia> <HML> Ever since nest :|
<HML> So yeah
<Sakuya> ...
<Sakuya> Nest went down almost 48 hours ago
<Sakuya> This problem started just a few hours ago
<Sakuya> Since it was fine even this morning
<HyperMetalLugia> <HML> Yeah, nest wasn't the issue per se
<HyperMetalLugia> <HML> But the lack of it made this worse
<HyperMetalLugia> <HML> Since there is only one server to have over 25people'
<Sakuya> Well, that's something people have to deal with, I agree with arti for taking it down

<drfsupercenter> 03so if people can't connect here they can connect there
<drfsupercenter> 03and since it's not actually linked here yet that script shows what's going on on each
<Aurora> 6the timing of ocean's problems is weird
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<Aurora> 6plus, I haven't seen it go down once
<drfsupercenter> 03well my server is up and running but it's not linked here
<drfsupercenter> 03it's gone down like 10 times today
<drfsupercenter> 03btw Aurora
<drfsupercenter> 03you'll never believe what I bought today
<HyperMetalLugia> Preordered xD
<Aurora> 6BW
<drfsupercenter> 03that totally gave it away >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03both games
<Aurora> 6not surprised
<Aurora> 6cuz you already told us
<drfsupercenter> 03I said I might
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Aurora> 6you intended to
<Aurora> 6ah
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6anyways
<drfsupercenter> 03when I heard about video chatting
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like
<drfsupercenter> 03do want
<drfsupercenter> 03portable webcams ftw
<Aurora> 6@quan, I'm mixed feelings about letting her on there
<Quanyails> 7Oh, yeah--remember, Celebi event comin' up.
<Aurora> 6*having
<nickstr> I am still a bit mixed on Black and White
<Quanyails> 7Aye, but that's what we came to you for.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, I was too, I decided to just buy the stupid thing
<Aurora> 6I know
<drfsupercenter> 03I got both because I collect the games
<Aurora> 6I'll handle it once again
<drfsupercenter> 03as for the stupid 5th generation Pokémon I'm gonna just ignore them LOL
<nickstr> I don't collect them
<drfsupercenter> 03pretend they're just generic pixels
<drfsupercenter> 03until I can get real ones
<Aurora> 6because haii has already caused problems on the gallery
<drfsupercenter> 03well I have every GBA/DS Pokémon title to date
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03not counting the Trading Card Game for GBC as that was stupid.
<nickstr> what about Gameboy and Gameboy Color?
<nickstr> you still have some work to do
<HyperMetalLugia> Get a GAB
<Aurora> 6TCG game for GB color
<HyperMetalLugia> *GBA
<Aurora> 6was actually fun
<Aurora> 6for a while
<Aurora> 6but still
<nickstr> you can pick up the older ones at thrift stores
<nickstr> but might have issues with dead button cells
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<nickstr> for R/B/Y its a CR1616 which can be replaced with a CR2025 and for G/S/C its a CR2025 which can be replaced with a CR2032
<Aurora> 6sigh
<Aurora> 6and here's where the freaking galleries fail
<Aurora> 6there's no message system
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Aurora> 6so i can't alert her
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<Aurora> 6unless I make a random post on something
<HyperMetalLugia> Don't you have her email?
<nickstr> I replaced the button cell in a copy of Pokemon Gold which now works perfectly
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, if she even has it
<Aurora> 6yeah but I don't think I ever got an lugia.us email
<Aurora> 6I am NOT sending from my normal email
<HyperMetalLugia> I need to do crystal, since it keeps giving me a corrupted file
<Aurora> 6last thing I need is her having it
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL I know XD
<Aurora> 6ok, apparently there's a glitch in crystal version
<Aurora> 6I want to test it
<nickstr> you need as I said a CR2025 or a CR2032
<HyperMetalLugia> Really?
<Aurora> 6a lot of people have tried it and either it's a huge coincidence
<Aurora> 6or an actual legit glitch
<Aurora> 6probably the most frustrating one at that
<HyperMetalLugia> And a special scredriver and soldering kit
<Aurora> 6something that seriously increases the chances of finding shiny pokemon
<HyperMetalLugia> What happens in it Rora?
<nickstr> they are both 3 volt lithium button cells but the CR2032 is slightly thicker
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Aurora> 6before you get pokeballs
<Aurora> 6 20:38	nickstr	you need as I said a CR2025 or a CR2032 <-get the 2032
<Aurora> 6apparently lasts longer
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly button cells, brought 4 for my SNES carts
<Aurora> 6but yeah, successfully replaced mine
<Aurora> 6so lovely
<HyperMetalLugia> Lucky ;(
<nickstr> its an exact replacement
<Quanyails> 7*random fangirlish moment*
<Quanyails> 7I haven't had one of those in a while. O_o
<nickstr> so you had the right idea
<HyperMetalLugia> So is a topic change randomly needed?
<Aurora> 6hmm
<Quanyails> 7Eh, that's just me.
<Aurora> 6I think I can lift her ban, but still prevent her from posting
<Quanyails> 7I've gotta sleep soon, so don't expect me.
<Aurora> 6that will give me enough time t send the PM
<Quanyails> 7A mute?
*drfsupercenter idles
<HyperMetalLugia> A mute on a forum, madness
<HyperMetalLugia> What a shock, DRF idling for once

<HyperSleepingLugia> Yeah..
<nickstr> Apple charges you up to twice as much for the same Foxconn hardware that HP and others have but in shiny cases with their name on it

<Soyuz> God damnit Kingdom hearts reference
<SilverSonic> lol where?
<eXAKR> holy sheet at that video
<nickstr> I know
<nickstr> some TV and FM transmit towers in the midwestern US really are that tall
<nickstr> I have seen one that is 1,676 feet tall
<Umbreon> 12?
<nickstr> but its all done in the name of coverage
<nickstr> with VHF and UHF the higher the better because you have a clearer line of site
<Soyuz> TheUnversed
<eXAKR> I got sweaty cold feet and palms just by watching this
<Soyuz> Kingdom Hearts BBS enemies
<nickstr> I know
<nickstr> but that job had to be done
<SilverSonic> ahh
<SilverSonic> xD
<SilverSonic> lololol
<Soyuz> while me doing a kingdom hearts fanfic
<Soyuz> oh joy
<nickstr> tower lighting is required by both the FCC and the FAA for towers that tall
<nickstr> basically its to keep airplanes, helicopters, and other flying vehicles from hitting the tower at night
<nickstr> and in other times of poor visability
<SilverSonic> D;
<eXAKR> Can't they use like, hot air balloons or something?
<Panda> yay i'm out of the hospital ^-^

<Ascendant> mibbit info
<drfsupercenter> 03and the webirc thing
<Ascendant> yeah
*Ascendant checks what else
<Draelen> I've pasted that stuff already ;p
<Ascendant> I think that's all really
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I got it
<Ascendant> oh
<Ascendant> modules
<drfsupercenter> 03she's just helping me is all
<Draelen> sanitizing the oper blocks now
<drfsupercenter> 03hey Draelen while you're at it
<Ascendant> 'sanitizing'
<drfsupercenter> 03can you give all the ircops op-override?
<drfsupercenter> 03because when services go down that's kinda needed
<Ascendant> oh, and add all the IRC ops operserv staff XD
<Ascendant> to*
<Ascendant> or maybe give drf services root
<Draelen> and yeah, mabye something a little more creative than tst.lugia.us ;p
<drfsupercenter> 03can't that be changed later?
<Draelen> it can, but it means having to go change linkblocks again
<Light_Latias> back...
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03you know
<drfsupercenter> 03can we just call it island.lugia.us?
<drfsupercenter> 03That one's really grown on me
<drfsupercenter> 03it sounds cool XD
<Ascendant> sure
<Draelen> fits in with ocean, I'd say ;p
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ascendant> get Arti to add the DNS
<drfsupercenter> 03let's do that
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll reply on the forum thread
<Ascendant> you guys figure out the link block passwords
<Draelen> whats the IP of the new server?
<Draelen> is the IP static?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes it is
<Ascendant> 64.32.1.34
<drfsupercenter> 0364.32.1.34
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Draelen> generating linkblock now
<Ascendant> alright
<Light_Latias> Liiiiiiiiiink...
<Ascendant> also drf, do a nslookup on the IP from your command prompt
<Ascendant> made me lol
<Draelen> Are the servers going to be linked with SSL? And which port is going to be used for the server links?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ascendant> sure
<drfsupercenter> 03SSL yes, 6697
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> we'll make it +7000
<drfsupercenter> 03same ports as yours basically
<Ascendant> for serversonly
<Ascendant> if that's okay with drf
<Draelen> Thats what I was meaning @ asc ;p
<Ascendant> yeah
<Draelen> 6697 is client only
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I don't care
<drfsupercenter> 03whatever works LOL
<Ascendant> k well then
<Ascendant> let me fix everything up
<Ascendant> do you want me to set autoconnect?
<Draelen> checking to be sure ocean accepts serveronly 7000 too
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah @ autoconnect
<Draelen> Current ports ocean accepts, FYI:
<Draelen> :10:59:45: -ocean.lugia.us- *** Listener on 72.20.16.202:8080, clients 1. is PERM
<Draelen> :10:59:45: -ocean.lugia.us- *** Listener on 72.20.16.202:6667, clients 19. is PERM
<Draelen> :10:59:45: -ocean.lugia.us- *** Listener on 72.20.16.202:6697, clients 5. is PERM clientsonly SSL
<Draelen> :10:59:45: -ocean.lugia.us- *** Listener on 72.20.16.202:7000, clients 0. is PERM serversonly SSL
<Draelen> :10:59:45: -ocean.lugia.us- *** Listener on 72.20.16.202:6001, clients 1. is PERM serversonly
<Draelen> services are connecting through 66012
<Draelen> 6601*
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> I have 6001 open on here
<Ascendant> and lol stats P
<Ascendant> [22:01:19] -drf.lugia.us- *** Listener on 64.32.1.34:9001, clients 1. is PERM clientsonly
<Ascendant> [22:01:19] -drf.lugia.us- *** Listener on 64.32.1.34:6001, clients 0. is PERM serversonly

<Ascendant> [22:01:19] -drf.lugia.us- *** Listener on 64.32.1.34:6697, clients 1. is PERM clientsonly SSL
<Ascendant> ignore the server name
<Ascendant> We're not allowed to open port 8080 on this thing or it'll get killed >>
<Draelen> 90 second server ping frequency, if wanting to keep those synched
<Ascendant> open proxy etc.
<Draelen> 160sec user ping freq
<Ascendant> oh
<Ascendant> I left that stuff as default like I usually do
<Ascendant> but hang on
<Draelen> it's a little more forgiving of timeouts and user disconnections
<Draelen> at the expense of longer time to pingout
<Draelen> and reduces netsplits a little
<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> I just set it on 160
<Ascendant> so, link block stuff?
<Draelen> is it windows or unix?
<Ascendant> unix
<Ascendant> some sort of bsd I believe
*Ascendant checks
<Ascendant> yep
<Ascendant> FreebSD
<Draelen> As for oper blocks, let me know which flags you need included in your ocean operblock
<Draelen> cleaning it up a little
<Ascendant> Uh...
<Ascendant> I'm not an oper lol
<drfsupercenter> 03<JoshtheRipper> Brad do you have any issues with " burn in " on your plasma?
<drfsupercenter> 03<KnaveBrad> nope

<drfsupercenter> 03<KnaveBrad> I have it bolted to the wall, so they can't really take it without some serious work
<drfsupercenter> 03ROFL
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> if anything
<Ascendant> if you really want to add an oper block for me go ahead...I'll only really need to use it for backup purposes
<Ascendant> in case something kabooms and stuff

<Ascendant> lmfao
<Draelen> drf has the oper block, finishing the link block
<Ascendant> alright
<Ascendant> PM me the oper blocks, drf?
<Ascendant> oh nvm
<Ascendant> xD
<Draelen> so SSL and ziplinks for the server connections?
<drfsupercenter> 03does that give us op override btw? LOL
<Draelen> or leaving ziplinks off
<Draelen> I'm assuming you are maintaining your own operblocks on that server
<Ascendant> I didn't allow ziplinks
<Draelen> And as for here, I added can_override

<drfsupercenter> 03<Bubbaprog> i guess there is a mountain high enough
<Draelen> for you at least, need to know which other active opers require it
<drfsupercenter> 03Aurora and Kyu
<drfsupercenter> 03the others dunno
<Ascendant> hm
<Draelen> add those manually in the link I provided then
<Ascendant> hang on
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Arti doesn't have override ability?
<drfsupercenter> 03her loss :P
<Ascendant> she uses /samode
<Draelen> it's not been required before ;p
<Draelen> requested*
<Draelen> rather
<Ascendant> yeah, you can usually /samode but it's a services admin thing
<Ascendant> x.x
<Ascendant> Oh Draelen, you should probably add the opers to the operserv staff list
<Draelen> drf, Kyu, Aurora?
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> and probably Feather too
<Ascendant> maybe drf as services root, up to you though
<drfsupercenter> 03just add everyone, I mean, we're ircops for a reason
<Ascendant> lmfao
<drfsupercenter> 03I mea
<Ascendant> well stupid SSH is lagging
<drfsupercenter> 03*mean
<drfsupercenter> 03everyone that's on the list already :P
*Draelen prefers an explicit list rather than a vauge "everyone" ;p
<drfsupercenter> 03well then
<Draelen> I assume ones like TimeShift and etc should not be on there, etc
<Ascendant> Feather, drf, Aurora, Kyu
<Ascendant> and TimeShift...left
<drfsupercenter> 03Kyu, Aurora, Feather, me
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Draelen> Indeed
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why Umbreon isn't on that list
<drfsupercenter> 03but I won't ask
<Ascendant> He wasn't on when the oper blocks were made
<Draelen> :11:27:37: -OperServ- drfsupercenter added to Services admin list.
<Draelen> :11:27:42: -OperServ- aurora added to Services admin list.
<Draelen> :11:27:48: -OperServ- kyu added to Services admin list.

<drfsupercenter> 03^ so true
*drfsupercenter adds that to his facebook quotes page
<Ascendant> k thanks Draelen
<Ascendant> and haha
<Draelen> Deploying linkblock for island.lugia.us, you'll only be able to /connect to ocean from islands side, until the DNS entry is fixed
<Ascendant> Ah
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Ascendant> what about the password?
<Draelen> that will follow shortly
<Ascendant> okay
<drfsupercenter> 03right well it's 6:30am here
<drfsupercenter> 03I should be going to bed
<drfsupercenter> 03just waiting until everything's taken care of
<Ascendant> should be just about done
<Draelen> linkblock for island active, it should be able to connect now
<Ascendant> alright, I'll just rehash and set autoconnect
<Draelen> Also, make sure you have a u:line configured for services.lugia.us, or bad things will happen ;p
<Ascendant> yeah I do
<Ascendant> I remember when I once didn't do that
<Ascendant> x.x
<Ascendant> bouncy modes yay
<Draelen> What is the network name used on istald?

<drfsupercenter> 03so if Draelen and Ascendant can figure this out I'm gonna go to bed.
<Ascendant> Alright, seeya drf

<Draelen2> well, thats just silly
<Armageddon> wtf
<Armageddon> I don't get it
<Draelen2> it was identical on both sides
<Armageddon> yeah o___o
<Draelen2> we arent keeping it as 'password' however ;p
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> I was going to say that
<Armageddon> hm

Cal II is like getting stabbed by a unicorn's horn while the elves turn into demons as the forest burns and all you wish for is the sweet release of death." :3

<Espeon> @ the thing Sky said: If a founder doesn't want something, it's not implemented (and the other way around) - no exceptions.
<PandaFlower> lol
<Espeon> Of course, unless an owner is just being totally stupid and/or trolling his/her community for some reason, then everyone should just leave, point and laugh.
<Ascendant> [08:20:29] [TST]Bot is ~TSTBot@viper.universehosting.com * Just your neighborhood-friendly TST bot :)

<Ascendant> now I poof
<Skylands> 10dumb idea? maybe, but Idc
<Quanyails> 7'kay.
<Kyu> 07and as for IVs just get them all as high as you can
<Griggs> that's the right way of thinking.
<drfsupercenter> 03wait is Celebi a wifi event?
<Kyu> 07mainly in attack and speed
<Quanyails> 7Gamestop event.

<Skylands> 10No wai
<Kyu> 07with a sp attack IV that is
<Griggs> my grandmother's microwave doesn't even have buttons, it's just turn the dial to how many minutes

<Sparky> I call Skyryd3r Sky
<Espeon> Skies everywhere

<drfsupercenter> 03good.
<drfsupercenter> 03Iskierka did you see Ascendant wanting to get the YouTube script?
<Iskierka> No, I didn't
<drfsupercenter> 03OK well
<drfsupercenter> 03we want the YouTube script for the new bot
<drfsupercenter> 03and she can't really figure out how to get it to display runtime and stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03and you had the one that was on Cone, right?
<Iskierka> I made the script, yes, or at least took an outdated one, improved it and made it actually work
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03can you just PM it to Ascendant?
<Iskierka> Well it's a little longer than a PM but getting the length is just one line
<Iskierka> Then again I don't know how Ascendant's done anything, but I'll PM it anyway
<jasperbot> i wish they didn't have to go o_O
<Neon> I wish meat was vegetable.
<Chimera> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBi7zwjp20E <-- WAT

<Iskierka> If cone's gone and taken the YT script with it I can bring my bot which runs it in
<drfsupercenter> 03I forget the script to change its name
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, Cone is gone. Arti took down nest along with cone
<drfsupercenter> 03but
*jasperdett needs to find a free hosting to run jasperbot on
<drfsupercenter> 03seeing as how it's just a mIRC bot

<Jason> err
<drfsupercenter> 03that is some seriously awesome stuff
<Jason> there is some out there, but they all have a catch
<Chimera> guys
<Chimera> the trailer
<Chimera> watch
<Iskierka> So, why didn't Bygiod trigger when chimera pasted a link?
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's messed up
<Jason> the best thing to do, is find an old box, and just run it off that
<drfsupercenter> 03if you say anything after it
<drfsupercenter> 03it won't work
<Chimera> weird
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why we want your script :P
<Iskierka> Ah, I'll tidy it up then
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Chimera> alright I'll fix: WAT --> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBi7zwjp20E

<Bygios> No statistics available for this video!
<Chimera> ok
<Chimera> Just making sure talking before the video didn't cause anything
<Shadow_Lugia> 6DRF: the first part...
<Iskierka> I am interested in how Ascendant wrote the script though
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Sounds like a bunch of different instruments on one line.
<Iskierka> just make sure that vid works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBi7zwjp20E
<HyperMetalLugia> ohai
<Bygios> No statistics available for this video!
<Iskierka> and something's bork
<Iskierka> oh yes
<Iskierka> I disabled it for SW, lol
<Iskierka> okay, once again, quick test then the bot goes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBi7zwjp20E
<Bygios> No statistics available for this video!
<Iskierka> hmm
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'm sure if you shmush an orchestra's worth of instrumental notes on one line, it'd sound and look similarly.
<drfsupercenter> 03also

<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdUy70dh8LY&feature=related

<Iskierka> 'com part #silverwings
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I saw it. :P
<Iskierka> well this is brilliant, my bot is broken
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<jasperdett> elitter is going to lose customers this way
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ooh, spammy part at end.
<Iskierka> good thing about mIRC bots, there's always just using it regularly
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Jason> you gotta concider that its a free service too, right
<jasperdett> yeah still
<Jason> if you have an extra box lying around, i can help you get it up and running with eggdrop
<jasperdett> which i do no0t
<jasperdett> not^
<Iskierka> trying it in another channel though my bot works fine with that link
<HyperMetalLugia> lol

<Jason> ah
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, apparently it was in the Touhou games too
<Chimera> fixed yay
<Chimera> Make the "YouTube" look like the logo like the past script plz?

<Shadow_Lugia> 6DRF:
<Shadow_Lugia> 6You notice the notes are in different colors?
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah what about it
<Shadow_Lugia> 6That means it's for different instruments. ovo
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o;
<Jason> do you have any friends with one?
<drfsupercenter> 03it sounds like a piano the entire time to me
<Shadow_Lugia> 6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ_wODRJCDs (Classic example.)
<junh1024-XD> on hickstr, in dp193, theres a small photo of misty+brock+ash
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, because it's on a piano-MIDI program.
<Andres> Make friends with one!
<Shadow_Lugia> 6And the tracks are smushed on one line. :P
<Iskierka> can anyone find a video with more dislikes than likes so I can test something? (preferably less than a thousand of each though)
<Jason> true.. true
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Beiber?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6@ Iskierka. :P
<Andres> Wait, Jasperbot already is jasperdetts best friend :D
<Iskierka> that will have more than a thousand
<Andres> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03that sounds like stuff other than piano @ Shadow_Lugia
<Jason> :O
<jasperbot> I say.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6True.
<jasperbot> I say, umm..
<jasperbot> BLAM.
<Jason> jasperbot is my best friend, right?
<jasperdett> Jason no
<jasperbot> tuesday
<drfsupercenter> 03but LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03notice how around 2:11 it starts lagging
<jasperdett> do you have any friends with one? <<< no
<Jason> huh
<Jason> would you have any uses for a server?
<Jason> other than this, because you can definitely just buy one
<Jason> if not, just rent one

<nickstr> yay, even with significant 25 Hz components filtered out this is working great
<Shadow_Lugia> 6o.o
<jasperdett> i don't have the money for a server
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL win
<Jason> $13/mo?
<HyperMetalLugia> Epic bieber fail
<jasperdett> no
<Jason> i would give you mine, but its full D:
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Please get off of me, cat, I'd like to get to my binder. ovo
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL :o
<drfsupercenter> 03shoot it out of a cannon.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes!
<HyperMetalLugia> Gorey death
<Iskierka> hmmnice, I think now all I need to be fairly happy with the YT script is something to strip commas for a calculation ...
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the other thing we're trying to do
<[MI]Fluorine> Hi armageddon
<[MI]Fluorine> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03is make it so quotes don't show as ;quot; or whateve rit is
<Iskierka> that is possible though will require a bit more work
<Armageddon> hey
<Jason> how much would a small comp cost
<Jason> a desktop
<Armageddon> afkish class
<Jason> with like, nothing installed
<Iskierka> unless we're really lucky and mIRC already has a function to parse that, which I doubt
<Jason> just the comp, and whats needed
<[MI]Fluorine> lol
<Jason> and a 10 GB HDD
<Cat> can you even get 10GB anymore?
<Iskierka> doesn't look to
<Cat> o.O
<Cat> if you're renting a server, it's probably actually a portion of a machine that serves lots of people
<Cat> which is why it's much cheaper
*Kitten waves
<Cat> it's a tiny portion of the whole price
<Cat> Hi Kitten :o
<Ascendant> hey
<Cat> wanna do my Java coursework for me?
<Cat> it's horrid D:
<NightSeas> Hello Ascendant :3
<Jason> huh
<Kitten> hi.. no?
<drfsupercenter> 03oh hi
<Ascendant> yo
<drfsupercenter> 03we're talking about scripting
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Ascendant> heya
<Jason> hey Kitten
<Ascendant> yeah I saw
<[MI]Fluorine> AFK myself
<Jason> Cat: no, but if you can find me a comp Without an HDD at a good price
<Jason> i want it for like $50
<jasperbot> I already have one of those.
<Jason> or $75 er something
<Cat> without a HDD?
<Jason> yes
<Jason> or with
<Jason> idrc
<Jason> i already have like 8 hdds here
<Cat> like, a new cpu costs £50 on its own unless you plan on buying a shit one
<Cat> D:
<Jason> CPU with everything?
<Cat> there are companies that sell refurbished old computers
<Ascendant> xD
<Cat> my cpu cost £146 :P
<Jason> oh, and it cant be loud
<drfsupercenter> 03http://lostinthecloudblog.com/2010/03/13/john-stump-composer-of-faeries-aire-and-death-waltz/
<drfsupercenter> 03]hm
<Cat> same goes for my graphics card
<Jason> mine = $460
<Jason> in its day
<Cat> what is it? o.O
<Jason> IBM
<Jason> $260**********
<Jason> lol
<Cat> ah
<Iskierka> I got kicked in the nads by my own owner-identifier on the bot, it seems
<Iskierka> which is why it was ignoring me
<Jason> but i want like a server to watch movies on
<Cat> what kind of weird pc are you using?
<Jason> IBM thinkpad
<Jason> Thinkcenter*
<Cat> surely the cpu itself isn't actually by IBM
<Cat> it's generally either intel or amd
<Ascendant> o_O
<Jason> its intel
<Jason> dual core
<Cat> so why did you say IBM?
<Cat> o.O
<Jason> i meant comp
<Cat> right
*Jason goes to the corner to cry
<Jason> but i need a whole comp for like less than $100
<Cat> when I say cpu, I mean the processor
<Cat> fool
<Jason> oh
<Jason> I NEEED A COMP FOR LESS THAN $100
<Iskierka> I set it up on the assumption that I'd have the same hotmask as the bot
<Shadow_Lugia> 6By the way, DRF: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_music
<Iskierka> it seems I don't, so it ignored me
<Andres> I'll trade you mine for a $1000 one.
<Cat> for a server?
<Jason> ok :D
<Jason> yes
<Jason> for a server
<Cat> you can probably get it for less than $100 used
<Jason> where?
<Jason> ebay? NO
<Jason> amazon? NO
<Cat> check the local ads in the paper? i dunno
<Cat> what's wrong with ebay or amazon?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL nice
<Jason> they dont have cheap ones
<drfsupercenter> 03so apparently Death Waltz isn't really Death Waltz.
<Cat> I know you certainly can't build a new pc for less than $100
<Jason> i could go for craigslist
<Yoko-San> an one here?????
<Cat> go for it
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a piano arrangement of a Touhou song that was falsely named
<Jason> but then you have to meet people
<Jason> and in 15
<Jason> so, yeah
<Jason> :S

<Soyuz> pff
<Soyuz> Dragon Age
<Prince-dari> Yeah, but I mean literally a day, 22 hours or so.
<Spyrorocks> Yes, make sure you feel really bad because your country isnt listed on the top of a country list for an online form.
<Prince-dari> It's only about a constant speed of 250KB/s which isn't that fast, just seems it in comparison to torrents.
<Spyrorocks> I want my users to be able to signup fast, and if 99% of my users come from those countries, it doesnt make sense for me to make them take longer to find their country in the list.
<Armageddon> That's good
<Spyrorocks> I guess I should also translate every one of my sites into every language I can so im not discriminating.

<Chimera> Bakugan just stole it
<Soyuz> what is that
<MajinMew> SOMETHING SOMETHING HEART OF THE CARDS
<Armageddon> xD
<Armageddon> 5Ds ended yesterday

<MajinMew> frieza got so oldddddd
<Armageddon> wtf is this shit
<MajinMew> "ohey guys, i still r not ded!"
<Armageddon> But Red Nova Dragon is so awesooooooome
<Soyuz> MajinMew; at least it isn't the new clone wars shit
<MajinMew> then trunks came back and divided by zero
<Soyuz> the old animated clone wars was fucking badass
<Damos> 13because you can't get hurt that way
<Soyuz> actually

<theguesst> I have a couple of friends who do
<Chimera> Because
<eXAKR> I wonder if there's a place within Pokémon Black that has no background music
<Armageddon> nope
<HyperMetalLugia> Your DS breaks from overheating, you have to buy a 3DS to play it
<theguesst> me, I know some spanish'
<eXAKR> And Chimera, continue
<Chimera> Nintendo didn't think of making awesome music in Black/White

<drfsupercenter> 03hm.
<drfsupercenter> 03Music MasterWorks fails too
<drfsupercenter> 03I think both of those, as well as Syntehsia or w/e it is, use the DirectShow MIDI parser
<drfsupercenter> 03and that's what's screwing up
<Aizen> o-o
<Aizen> imma give up
<Aizen> im so damn usless
<Aizen> at script at any language

<Aizen> something doesnt work

<Ascendant> o_O
<Armageddon> wb Drake
<Armageddon> Aizen lol
<Armageddon> it's simpler than you think it is
<Drake> 04ty
<Armageddon> learn the basic syntax
<Armageddon> then use logic to make scripts out of it
*Armageddon hugs Drake
*Drake hugs back
<Caaz> ~(Armageddon) and that if you drop one thing and give up all the time ou're a shithead<- I drop everything and give up most things, and i'm WOOOONDERFULLLL

<Aizen> hmmm
<Aizen> perl was desent
<Caaz> decent
<Caaz> I'm willing to bet most of your errors are typos
<Aizen> as in running
<Caaz> Most of mine are
<Aizen> Caaz
<Aizen> do you know why i gave up
<Aizen> larning perl
<Armageddon> XD Caaz
<Caaz> is it because of me

<drfsupercenter> 03...LOL
<Armageddon> perl lmfao
<Armageddon> perl is a pain in the ass
<drfsupercenter> 03QuickTime Player almost gets it right, then it just randomly borks
<Armageddon> python > perl
<Caaz> perl is simple shit
<drfsupercenter> 03there's seriously like at least 25 piano notes at once
<Armageddon> python > C > C++ > perl
<Armageddon> that's how much I dislike perl :{D
<drfsupercenter> 03I need to find a MIDI engine that doesn't screw up like that
<Armageddon> it gets a worse rating than C++ does
<Armageddon> and I hate C++
<Caaz> But but but, my bot is total perl awesomeness

<drfsupercenter> 03you don't happen to recognize the program used in that YT video, do you?
<Armageddon> Aizen
<Armageddon> learn PHP
<Aizen> if you were to lighten up a ton then just maybe people like me wont get pirckish at you
<junh1024-XD> no
<Aizen> And you know for a fact im right
<Aizen> you know
<Caaz> I know what you mean Aizen. I simply don't like helping.
<Aizen> well why open a help chan for perl
<Aizen> ?
<Caaz> I didn't.
<Aizen> if you dont like help
<Caaz> Other people did and asked me to help
<Aizen> well you let it evolve into one
<Caaz> Wait you mean powerplant? That's my chill channel, all mah homies hang out there
<Aizen> im just pissed that i know for a fact there isnt a language out there were it comes nautrally
<Armageddon> Aizen
<Armageddon> find yourself a language you'll like
<Aizen> so yea i admit i suck at all kinds of script
<Caaz> There's english
<drfsupercenter> 03...LOL Roni Music
<Armageddon> try PHP or C
<drfsupercenter> 03I see why you like it
<Aizen> the fact is ManiZach whom i trust the most he said
<junh1024-XD> it has lots of knobs :>
<Caaz> Aizen, look at the bright side, you obviously don't give up
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03can you just tell it to play the thing and not touch it?
<Aizen> meh.
<drfsupercenter> 03Ultimately I want to make a WAV of it
<Ascendant> audacity
<Armageddon> afk now
<drfsupercenter> 03u
<drfsupercenter> 03*uh
<Caaz> You try hard and you fall hard, doing this is called trial and error, eventually what will happen is you being pro at everything.

<drfsupercenter> 03Audacity doesn't do midi
<Armageddon> Aizen lol
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<drfsupercenter> 03it does
<drfsupercenter> 03but wtf
<Armageddon> it took me a month to learn hTML properly
<Armageddon> even now I'm not that good at it
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<Armageddon> you need patience
<drfsupercenter> 03it won't play it
<Aizen> `ew
<Aizen> websites i suck at those
<Aizen> xD
<Armageddon> programming languages take several months to properly learn
<Armageddon> so just try one
<Armageddon> and don't give up on it
<Armageddon> and you'll succeed
<Armageddon> anyway afk
<junh1024-XD> I would say the best MIDI synthesizer for windoze is sibelius. it can render offline, and it has realistiche instruments if you install kontakt.
<Armageddon> Drake go give him the "GO GET EM" talk or something
<Armageddon> XD
<Aizen> imma move on to ruby
<Aizen> :[
<Drake> 04?

<Ascendant> Finale Notepad is not too bad either
<drfsupercenter> 03Finale is awesome
<Ascendant> but it still sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03but I think that justs uses the DirectShow
<Ascendant> xD
<Caaz> Ruby has some perl pythonishness, so I think you'll have a great time
<Ascendant> anyway afk
<drfsupercenter> 03and I've already found out that does't work for this
<drfsupercenter> 03and junh1024-XD I'm guessing you know of a better one for Mac? LOL
<junh1024-XD> Finale Notepad is eh
<Armageddon> lol Roby
<Armageddon> Ruby
<Armageddon> not the best language
<Armageddon> try C
<Caaz> Here, look at this, I came across these forums while googling myself.
<Armageddon> seriously, it's a useful language
<Caaz> C is pretty simple, I learned a bit of it when I was 10.
<junh1024-XD> sibelius and garageband & logic are options for mac. you could also use Finale Notepad but that is meh, as i said.
<Caaz> Remember none of it, but if I can learn it at 10 i figure it's simple
<Caaz> Oh yes and link that I forgot to pasta http://www.supportforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=18

<drfsupercenter> 03can you just try this midi with your tools and see if anything can play it without horribly skipping?

<Aizen> must be the size of like
<Aizen> a damn bible
<Aizen> @_@
<Caaz> Lol
<n2> no, it's its own thing as far as i can tell
<Caaz> It's past 1000 lines already.
<Aizen> well ya see its well on its way
<n2> wait...that does not make sense
<Caaz> The thing is, after you get past the things it needs to connect and parse 400 messages, all you need to do is add commands, which is nothing so you're pretty free from there.
<Aizen> all i wana as my ideal bot is
<Aizen> chan protection|blacklist|tourney|
<Aizen> sorta thing
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf is wrong with this multitrack of Runaway
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not Audacity's fault, it's the tracks
<n2> i cant tell is microsoft's built in synth counts as midi for you
<Caaz> Chan protection and blacklist seem kind of pointless seeing as it's stuff chanserv can handle, though tourney is pretty complicated I guess.
<n2> because i have no clue as to midi
<Aizen> hmm
<Aizen> :/
<n2> because right now its 4:30 and i am counting dshot as the set of codecs everyone has but everyone hates
<drfsupercenter> 03DirectShow is the Microsoft thing, yes.
<Caaz> Wow I type long lines, most of these nearly reach the ends of my screen, and I have a pretty big screen, and a small font. Interesting.

<drfsupercenter> 03OK I'll check it out
<Caaz> Yeah I'ma play with minecraft seeing as I still don't want to mess with Luka.
<drfsupercenter> 03which one, Maestro?
<n2> i doubt it will do anything if you have problems with directshow
<n2> yeah
<n2> the player wont play mid files
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't have problems iwth directshow
<drfsupercenter> 03it just doesn't like this midi

<n2> yeah, i see what you mean
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<n2> fair enough then
<drfsupercenter> 03it's because of the sheer number of notes

<Aizen> i got a youtube identifier
<n2> japanese input system
<Aizen> based on a old
<Aizen> hawkee script
<Aizen> wanna see it
<n2> its kinda like ASCII for japanese characters
<n2> its used on older stuff
<n2> while newer stuff moved to UTF-8
<Armageddon> ah
<drfsupercenter> 03wait wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03it's asking me for some sort of serial number or somethign
<Armageddon> well pretty much all the scripts on NS|VNC are coded by me
<Armageddon> with the exception of the weather scripts
<Armageddon> and the scramble scripts are modified versions of something I found on hawkee
<Armageddon> but that was when I was a noob at msl
<Armageddon> so I'm going to rewrite those scripts
<Aizen> http://aizen.pastebin.com/HiUgmB1U
<n2> hmm...
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't speak Japanese so I really have no idea x.x

<Caaz> Can't stop laughing.
<Aizen> nice tune
<n2> bah dmanit
<n2> i am out of time
<Iskierka> to deal with japanese-language installers: install ATLAS translation dictionary (by pirating unless you want to pay), then Translation Aggregator (first google result for that), then there's a setting in TA that lets you inject a dll that translates windows menus
<n2> the installer is the same in english though...
<n2> windows installer is the definition of generic
<Aizen> xD @ cazzy's picture
<Armageddon> haha
<Iskierka> some installers do things differently on occasion so having a way of telling what it wants on a random screen is useful
<Ascendant> hey Iskierka

<Iskierka> iiit's a little slow.
<Ascendant> yeah it is
<Iskierka> maybe I can speed it up by adding something like a check for any HTML tags in the line, so it'll skip any pure-text ...
<Iskierka> but I think most lines have HTML
<Iskierka> so the regex for that would make it even slower

<Ascendant> doesn't like replying to pings

<Iskierka> epic lag
<Iskierka> ... I hope.
<Iskierka> bot miiiight want restarting just to clear everything
<eXAKR> oo
<eXAKR> Touhou.
<eXAKR> http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/24/apple-unveils-thunderbolt/ <- Oh great
<eXAKR> my computer feels obsolete again
<HyperMetalLugia> fun
<eXAKR> Never mind
<eXAKR> I will get a new computer when Windows 8 SP1 comes out
<eXAKR> That should be about 2013?
<HyperMetalLugia> 2014
<eXAKR> Then I will ask for the latest and greatest in everything'
<eXAKR> full suite of Thunderbolt and USB 3.0 ports
<eXAKR> latest 8-core or 12-core processor
<eXAKR> 12 GB of RAM
<eXAKR> 4TB SSD hard drive
<HyperMetalLugia> over 9000$
<eXAKR> Graphics cards that will even make Crysis cry
<Iskierka> I have doubts how useful 10 Gb/s would actually be
<eXAKR> Over $9000 today, affordable in 2013 or 2014
<eXAKR> I predict
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't
<Iskierka> to anything other than dedicated server hardware which is already faster
<eXAKR> Hmmm.
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll keep my i7-860, 4GB of DDR3 ram, 32bit OS and a HD4350 until I need to upgradre
<eXAKR> I should still be on my Logitech Solar Keyboard by then
<eXAKR> I don't see this getting obsolete or breaking anything soon
<eXAKR> *anytime
<eXAKR> And as for my monitor
<eXAKR> If Dell makes an affordable LED IPS monitor with glossy black bevel and white accents, I will buy
<eXAKR> Otherwise sticking with this one
<eXAKR> I have an i5
<eXAKR> But I also use 4GB of DDR3 RAM
<eXAKR> I have a HD 4670
<eXAKR> And 64 bit
<HyperMetalLugia> 64 is meh to me
<HyperMetalLugia> I have no real use for it
<eXAKR> Well, sooner or later you are going to run into apps that demand or run best under 64-bit
<eXAKR> You know
<eXAKR> Talking about displays
<HyperMetalLugia> And that'll be when I upgrade my entire PC
<eXAKR> What could be best is to have an LED IPS monitor
<eXAKR> with auxilary holographic projectors
<eXAKR> That is my future fantasy
<eXAKR> Keyboards of the future will either all be flat and thin with scissor switches
<eXAKR> Or bulky with Cherry or buckling-spring switches
<eXAKR> Mouse, no more
<eXAKR> In the future everyone uses a touchpad or touchscreen
<eXAKR> And in the future everyone uses USB3.0 and Thunderbolt
<eXAKR> Computers of the near-to-mid future will have 8 cores or more
<eXAKR> 4 cores will be the minimal standard
<eXAKR> And computer cases will all look sleek and minimal
<eXAKR> with no obnoxious lights
<HyperMetalLugia> I hate touchpads
<eXAKR> Well,
<eXAKR> Touchpads with multitouch technology
<eXAKR> I'm intending to get a Wacom Pen & Touch
<HyperMetalLugia> My fingers are too sweaty to use them
<eXAKR> It's a tablet and touchpad rolled into one
<eXAKR> I think that should be better
<eXAKR> than using a mouse
<eXAKR> You know
<eXAKR> Screw it
<eXAKR> I might as well start saving up on buying a new iMac now
<eXAKR> Or a new Dell
<eXAKR> If I'm going to buy an iMac, it's just to annoy drf
<eXAKR> Buy an iMac
<eXAKR> Post a picture of it here
<eXAKR> EVERYDAY
<eXAKR> Sing praises about
<eXAKR> it
<eXAKR> Annoy him to no end
<eXAKR> (I will still install Windows 7 on it)
*eXAKR hides
<eXAKR> Or maybe Windows 8
<eXAKR> I don't like what Apple is doing to Mac OS X
<eXAKR> They are cheapifying it

<Iskra> 24/1239-37 [ScriptBot PING reply]: 1hr 21mins 19secs hahawut
<Iskra> scriptbot definitely borked for a while there
<Iskra> computer cases tried sleek and minimal previously, everyone moved to fancy, I doubt it's going to go back
<Iskra> 4 core minimum is unlikely in the near future
<Iskra> mice going out of use is more-or-less impossible, the mouse is too precise a tool for everyone to go to something less precise just because it's better for the wrist of something
<Iskra> even less likely to occur because the new proposal is fancier

<Neon> That'll be 176 dollars.
<Prince-dari> Maybe check packets sent/received by a computer that does meet their requirements and compare it to yours?
<Prince-dari> When you try to open google or something.
<Prince-dari> Then you could just replicate what it does with a proxy like charles.
<Stormy> Hmm

<Andres> This is channel in mourning! As you can see from the black text in the topic :o
<nickstr> AAC is not crap
<Andres> I'm not good at mourning :/
<nickstr> its a more modern and efficient codec than mp3
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said AAC was
<drfsupercenter> 03I said whatever program can import MIDI but not save it
<nickstr> Ascendant did
<Armageddon> heya Luna
<drfsupercenter> 03that being said I still prefer MP3 over AAC because the tags actually work in Winamp
<nickstr> the AAC tags work in Winamp too
<junh1024-XD> FLAC tags don't work, either
<drfsupercenter> 03gtsdll doesn't like them
<nickstr> FLAC tags work in Winamp too

<nickstr> then don't use GTSDLL

<steff12321> ho
<Chimera> Nah, I did it a few times

<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying to find a program that can change that

*Sneas hugs people randomly
<steff12321> hi ariste
*Armageddon hugs back :3
*Soyuz is now dead because Sneas strangled him
<Armageddon> xD
<nickstr> they are just doing the same thing as almost everyone else who is subtitling Pokemon
<nickstr> not providing anything unique
<junh1024-XD> set 224 bpm.
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf though
<Soyuz> I ran fucking maybe 2400 meters
<drfsupercenter> 03in this .mus, it changes temps all over the place
<steff12321> hi aristeoooooo!
<drfsupercenter> 03It should be 224 all the way through, yes?
<junh1024-XD> garageband 3 supports fixed tempo.
<Soyuz> which I'm guessing entirely
<drfsupercenter> 03so does anything else
<Armageddon> xD
<drfsupercenter> 03but the song itself changes them
<Armageddon> fun
<junh1024-XD> G4 supports variable tempo but you need to set it yourself
<Soyuz> try without stopping
<Soyuz> and constantly panting
<junh1024-XD> sibelius supports variable
<Soyuz> then running at the end
*steff12321 licks aristeo
<Soyuz> so much fun
<junh1024-XD> and the danger with combining it into 1track, is that overlapping notes may interfere.
<junh1024-XD> this is what happened with my 1st render.
*steff12321 sits on aristeo's lap

<drfsupercenter> 03let's see how this handles now
<steff12321> lol
<steff12321> this is kinda ez
<drfsupercenter> 03you have any use for a .mus file though?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the original sheet music of all of it

<drfsupercenter> 03same problem

<Aurora> 6anyways
<Ascendant> People do listen but you have to enforce it...people show a lack of respect
<Aurora> 6for courtesty
<Ascendant> I probably do too
<Aurora> 6>.>
<Aurora> 6ok well
<Ascendant> But yes, respect
<Aurora> 6it's hard to enforce something
<Ascendant> then kick them
<Aurora> 6when the other mod here says "i don't care"
<Ascendant> haha
<Ascendant> it's still your choice though
<Aurora> 6otherwise I don't have a problem
<Ascendant> so you can actually go ahead and kick the user
<Aurora> 6yes I'm aware i can kick people
<Aurora> 6and I do
<Aurora> 6but at the same time
<NightSeas> Well, the swearing rules we have are very important to me
<Aurora> 6I was just mentioning to junh
<Aurora> 6etc
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Aurora> 6I need to do homework

<Aurora> 6like
<Griggs> n4
<Aurora> 6literallu
<Aurora> 6skipped a beat
<Espeon> o.o
<Espeon> nope
<Aurora> 6I'm sitting here measuring my pulse, and it skipped like 2 beats o_o
<Soyuz> n1
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, so what I can make of this
<drfsupercenter> 03the song is actually just called something like S Flandre's Theme
<Aurora> 6S?
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure where UN Owen Was Her came from, that's probably just some stupid English dubtitle
<Aurora> 6where'd they get s?
<Armageddon> ohai Xeli and Griggs and Soyuz
<Aurora> 6no
<Griggs> hi
<Aurora> 6that's the original name
<Armageddon> and there's an n2 ;o
<drfsupercenter> 03the letter S is actually in the title
<Aurora> 6I have the japanese albums
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6well
<drfsupercenter> 03http://pastebin.com/4FuByW3e
<drfsupercenter> 03see the letter S? LOL
<Aurora> 6the phrase UN Owen Was Her is english translated
<Aurora> 6but a direct translation
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> well Aurora
<Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a 14Staravia.
<Espeon> Well nobody wants to be a n3
<Ascendant> if you want I can make ScriptBot kick f*** etc.
<drfsupercenter> 03ROFL
<Aurora> 6the s....might be for sister
<drfsupercenter> 03Google's translation
<Aurora> 6...um, doesn't it already?
<Aurora> 6oh
<Aurora> 6wait
<Aurora> 6nvm
<drfsupercenter> 03"S Flandre that black people tried to play more as a part divided into different"
<drfsupercenter> 03LMFAO
<Aurora> 6yeah do that
<Ascendant> it only kicks < censored>
<Aurora> 6...wth?
<Soyuz> Armageddon; I need some Grammar and Latin
<drfsupercenter> 03I just stuck that Japanese into Google translate
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I'm waiting for Sparky LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I need someone who actually knows what this crap means
<Aurora> 6wow lol
<Espeon> from what I understand it first changes the word to < censored> then kicks, as Ascendant said lol.
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just mode +G
<drfsupercenter> 03but see
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly
<drfsupercenter> 03if someone's bothered enough to censor themselves
<drfsupercenter> 03why should they be kicked?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll be like "This is f***ing stupid" and whatnot
<drfsupercenter> 03using 3 stars isn't really swearing :P
<Espeon> the thing that makes me support censoring is that without it people come in swearing just to appear to be internet thugs or something
<drfsupercenter> 03because in real life I say "this is f'ing stupid"
<Espeon> that is truly obnoxious
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6drf
<Aurora> 6here's the original, untranslated theme title
<Aurora> 6U.N.オーエンは彼女なのか？
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03then where the heck did the other title come from
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14kz7Qa62E

<Aurora> 6for some people it's not a problem
<Aurora> 6but at the same time, it really shouldn't be necessary to put it in there in the first place
<Aurora> 6the f word is the only one that I have a serious issue with
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't like the word itself
<drfsupercenter> 03but even IRL
<Aurora> 6I know, but you don't care
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll be like "this is effing stupid"
<NightSeas> f & s word for me
<Espeon> Well, if people can type "fuc*" as much as they want then it can end up realy silly.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03f is just a letter
<drfsupercenter> 03if you say something is f'ing something
<Ascendant> derp

<drfsupercenter> 03that's not the actual f word
<drfsupercenter> 03:P

<Espeon> the "f-word" and "n-word" is really the two I find obnoxious
<Ascendant> I just do f***ing or similar
<drfsupercenter> 03same
<Espeon> because keyboard warriors use them
<drfsupercenter> 03also LOL
<Espeon> all the time
<Ascendant> n?
<Espeon> take a guess
<Ascendant> oh
<NightSeas> Erm
<Ascendant> that one
<drfsupercenter> 03YouTube is recommending HOT GIRLS on Teen Cribz as the most related to that Bad Apple video
*drfsupercenter hides

<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew :(
<Espeon> Lol wut
<HyperMetalLugia> And now I broke my laptop's midi playback ;D
<Ascendant> it's fgts who try too hard that use the n thing
<HyperMetalLugia> Like, nothing plays
<Ascendant> dunno why people use it
<Ascendant> it's just like wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03because blacks do
<Ascendant> >people who take offence
<drfsupercenter> 03it's one of those things
<drfsupercenter> 03that if they stopped calling themself that
<drfsupercenter> 03people would stop
<Ascendant> well people can learn to ignore that crap
<Ascendant> except they don't
<drfsupercenter> 03but they're all "Yo yo my n****" and whatnot
<Ascendant> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03so then others use it
<drfsupercenter> 03and they rage
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm like
<drfsupercenter> 03you brought it on yourself
<Ascendant> xD
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Espeon> Well those use the word almost like some people say "sup bro?"
<Espeon> that's kinda odd
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Espeon> and if a white guy says it, OMG RACIST
*Espeon HIDES

<drfsupercenter> 03yo momma ftw
<Ascendant> I remember he did that
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Espeon> I see some people finding damn, hell and so on to be like really offensive, that's not something I agree on personally
<drfsupercenter> 03I do your mom jokes all the time
<Ascendant> well you don't use it in arguments
<RAy> 02FFF
<Espeon> and yo momma is funny, but not when it's like
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Ray
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you need a script
<drfsupercenter> 03I have /nickdrfall that changes my nick to drfsupercenter on all networks
<Ray> 02yep
<Ascendant> because it's basically like you automatically lose the argument
<Espeon> "I ran out of arguements (as in calling people gay) - so I must make a yo mamma joke!"
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Godwin's Law?
<Ascendant> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'll do that when it's funny
<HyperMetalLugia> Well
<HyperMetalLugia> Sure
<drfsupercenter> 03like if someone's all "oh this is stupid"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like
<drfsupercenter> 03your mom is stupid
<Ascendant> XD
<Espeon> Yes SL, just with yo mamma / powerwords instead of Hitler comparisons.
<Ascendant> well that's not exactly yo momma @ drf
<drfsupercenter> 03Hitler comparisons?
<drfsupercenter> 03and yeah I know
<Ascendant> uh well

<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ascendant> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Ascendant for 10 minutes
<NightSeas> Just a suggestion, but I do think there should be a kick for poorly censored f words
<Ascendant> I don't find internet memes funny
<Ascendant> NightSeas, lrn2read
<drfsupercenter> 03it depends on what it is
<drfsupercenter> 03I find the over 9000 stuff funny
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Espeon> I in general do not find them funny, but I'm not like those
<drfsupercenter> 03depends on how you use them
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Ascendant> scroll up and look at the discussion
<Espeon> "OMG it's mainstream now it sucks"
<Ascendant> yeah it does
<drfsupercenter> 03but if it's like
<Espeon> people
<drfsupercenter> 03I have over 9000 tests this week
<drfsupercenter> 03or something
<drfsupercenter> 03then sure go for it
<Ascendant> if it's used at the right time it can be funny
<Ascendant> but if used like zomg every damn line
<Espeon> I mean over 9000 is almost a part of my language xD
<Ascendant> then no, it's not
<drfsupercenter> 03<Espeon> I mean over 9000 is almost a part of my language xD <- this
<Espeon> instead of saying like "gazillion" or "umpteen" or something
<Ascendant> yeah but retards who use it every line?
<Espeon> if something i HUGE
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Espeon> then it's over 9000

<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I want a flac

<junh1024-XD> kwell, you're not losing much, so eh
<HyperMetalLugia> lol

<Ascendant> hah Xeli
<Espeon> is my current catchphrase
<Ascendant> xD
<HyperMetalLugia> BRB, laptop logoff/reset
<Ascendant> I dunno whether I have a current catchphrase
<Espeon> Also I find it funny how many people just have "admin" as their router password
*Espeon hides again
<Ascendant> although it's probably gtfo or stfu
<Ascendant> and Xeli XD
<Ascendant> mine doesn't have a password
<Ascendant> because I cbf to set one
<Ascendant> XD
<Espeon> mine has one, but I didn't know until recently when I dabbled in the forbidden art of MAO out of curiosity
<Espeon> and that's just a glitch in agame, don't think of it
<Espeon> xD
*Espeon dies

<n2> [05:49:48] <Espeon> Also I find it funny how many people just have "admin" as their router password <-makes my life easier
<Ascendant> hah
<Ascendant> oh hey n2, do you have a mIRC mailing script? lol
<Ascendant> like, send mail from mIRC x.x
<n2> no
<n2> i cant imagine it would be that hard to make though
<[MI]Fluorine> rofl Majin

<Aristeo> yay!
<HyperMetalLugia> Tomorrow I'll change my WB message
<n2> yeah, sending mail seems really easy
<Chimera> mew
<n2> again, if you dont use a service like gmail where SMTP is required to go over SSL
<n2> then you will have to figure out the overhead of establishing an SSL connection
<Espeon> Serebii and intelligence can't co-exist.
<Espeon> Ever.
<Armageddon> [09:57] <Espeon> Serebii and intelligence can't co-exist.
<Armageddon> [09:57] <Espeon> Ever.
<Armageddon> ^
<n2> ah serebii isnt that bad
<n2> :<
<n2> when you take him out of his element
<n2> er...take him out of his channel
<Armageddon> XD
<n2> i think i blew up everyone's heads
<Armageddon> xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, touhou music blew up my laptop's music playbac
<HyperMetalLugia> icba to fix that
<Ascendant> well n2
<Ascendant> I can use Horde/SquirrelMail
<Ascendant> dunno
*Stitch appears.
<Armageddon> xD
<[MI]Fluorine> Serebii is a fucking disgrace to the damn internet
<n2> the key is to use a service that allows you to use an external mail client
<n2> if they say it can connect with outlook or thunderbird, you are probabally fine
<n2> because fact of the matter is nobody wants to write a script for a web interface
<n2> too easy to break shi..stuff
<Armageddon> 4chan is too lol
<[MI]Fluorine> Derp
*HyperMetalLugia is dissapoint
<n2> find a service that allows POP3/SMTP
<Andres> Oh no!
<n2> send the mail via SMTP
<Andres> Kill it with fire!
<n2> and call it a day
<n2> :<
<Soyuz> pff no Latin Armageddon? :P
<n2> knowing how spammers ruined mail though, it probabally wont be easy
<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> well as long as it's not sendmail
<Ascendant> sendmail is buggy as HELL
<n2> initial findings say it should be easy
<Armageddon> nope
<n2> connect using SMTP and send the correct commands
<Ascendant> is it possible to send via cmd?
<Ascendant> or well
<n2> define cmd
<Ascendant> I could use PHP's mail function
<Ascendant> get mIRC to message the CLI interface
<n2> wait, what?
<Ascendant> wtf
<Ascendant> -interface
<n2> are you using mIRC or PHP
<Soyuz> Bah
<Ascendant> mIRC
<n2> *mIRCscript
<Ascendant> yeah
<n2> where did php come from?
<Ascendant> well, php has a mail() function or something
<n2> yeah, but i mean how did php come into the picture here
<Ascendant> couldn't you create a page and then have mIRC do some socket crap and do stuf f on the page?
<Ascendant> idk
<n2> that seems like uncessary overhead?
<n2> *unnecessary
<Ascendant> idk
<n2> you are using sockets to connect to an smtp server?
<Ascendant> I don't know much about mail
<Ascendant> least of all smtp
<Chimera> fffffffffffffffffff guys
<n2> do you know what POP3/SMTP or IMAP is?
<Chimera> Black/White doesn't have game corner at all ;_;
<Ascendant> yeah I know what they are
<n2> great
<Ascendant> but I don't know how they work
<Ascendant> they're protocols obviously
<n2> well, thats why god gave us google
<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> hm
<n2> and the glorious RFC documents
<Ascendant> I wonder if I could do it via ZNC...
<n2> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0821.txt
<n2> would you look at that
<Ascendant> xD
<n2> a document explaining everything you need to know about SMTP
*nickstr np: Mayumi Iizuka - Rapurasu Ni Notte (TV Anime [Poketto Monsutaa] Endingu Teema Songu) [03:50m/320kbps/44kHz]
<Ascendant> D
<Ascendant> XD
<nickstr> this actually is a good song for channel separation tests on stereo transmitters
<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> well I'll see what I can figure out
<n2> take a note from mail clients
<n2> office only uses SMTP to SEND mail, not receive
<n2> *outlook
<n2> thats the point of pop3
<Chimera> <MajinMew> http://www.serebiiforums.com/showpost.php?p=12009088&postcount=568
<Chimera> sense
<Chimera> does not make
<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> well this only needs sending
<n2> so, what is stopping you from just making your own mail client
<Ascendant> not receiving
<n2> the simpliest thing in the world
*Kitten|SC pounces her Stitch
<Armageddon> it makes sense to me
<n2> *the simpliest mail client in the world
<[MI]Fluorine> Ellie is fail, she needs a gline
<[MI]Fluorine> :>
<n2> most of these protocols are really easy to read
<n2> and work with
*SilverSonic back
*SilverSonic is back*
<HyperMetalLugia> WB and brb
<HyperMetalLugia> brb
<SilverSonic> ty and kk
<Armageddon> wb
<SilverSonic> ty ^^
<Armageddon> I'd /os chankill SPP if they moved here lol
<[MI]Fluorine> rofl
<[MI]Fluorine> DO IT
<Ascendant> ah
<n2> MAIL <SP> FROM:<reverse-path> <CRLF>
<n2> ort errors. If accepted,
<n2> the receiver-SMTP returns a 250 OK reply.
<[MI]Fluorine> Also I've made a few posts to the forums
<[MI]Fluorine> :D
<n2> you are even familliar with the style from working with sockets and the http protocol
*Stitch hugs Nekola.
<Ascendant> sockets aren't my thing
<Armageddon> nice :3
<n2> sockets are annoying
<n2> but when you need to use them, use them well
*Nekola hugs
<Ascendant> yeah
*Andres hugs the skies.
<n2> and not halfas..wing it like what i did with mircservices
<Neon> Tesla attack was effective.
<Espeon> I don't see why people bother with sites that's not worth bothering with.
<Ascendant> XD
<Armageddon> xD
<Armageddon> also Xeli
<Armageddon> just posted TCTL chapter 5
<n2> that was my first and last script using sockets
<MajinMew> TCTL? o:
<[MI]Fluorine> SPP is a piece of shit, infact brb gonna troll SPP

<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> Hey Iskra
<Ascendant> /late by 16 minutes
<Iskra> 16 mins?
<Iskra> how do you figure that?
<Ascendant> whois
<Ascendant> I have a +E module installed that is for normal users and serves the same purpose as +W
<Ascendant> I have it set on myself
<Espeon> I'll see tomorrow.
<Iskra> I'm just wondering where 16 comes from ...
<Iskra> since I'd spoken more recently than that on other channels but far longer here
<Ascendant> [10:03] -island.lugia.us- *** Iskra (Airwolf@somerandomipthing) did a /whois on you.
<Iskra> Ah.
<Ascendant> /umode2 +E
<Armageddon> okay XD
<Ascendant> Oh yes, your script works really well, thanks
<Armageddon> o-o
<drf|away> 03were there any other ones that you made for Cone?
<drf|away> 03@ Iskra
<Iskra> :p did some quite thorough testing on the basis of how it works, so after that prompt it only took a little work to get it to that very good stage. And only the forum post reporter
<[MI]Fluorine> Armageddon: Nice :>
<[MI]Fluorine> I read it
<Iskra> were things like !define on cone? I could have a go at writing those
<Armageddon> xD
<drf|away> 03no
<Armageddon> You should read Reminiscence
<drf|away> 03those are [TST]Bot
<Armageddon> I need to rewrite it though
<Armageddon> beginning and stuff sucks
<[MI]Fluorine> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> I have +E on :D
<Ascendant> I think most of the scripts on Cone are on ScriptBot
<Ascendant> minus the scripts I don't have and !chatstats
<Ascendant> I'll set that up one day in the future
<steff12321> k
<Ascendant> also Iskra, would you be able to have a go a writing a mailing script? o.o
<Iskra> how would such work?
<[MI]Fluorine> B/W are being released soon, right?
<Iskra> ie; what would it do
<[MI]Fluorine> As in March
<Armageddon> idk
<Armageddon> I'm waiting for Yugioh 2011
<[MI]Fluorine> Cuz if so, I'm fucked
<Armageddon> ._.
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> it'd mail some stuff to an email address
*n2 bangs head on wall
<[MI]Fluorine> Basically, I'll have to decide between CoD and Halo map packs or B/W
<[MI]Fluorine> :(
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Ascendant> n2 I suck
<Ascendant> end of story
<Ascendant> XD
<n2> and i thought my rants would have meant something :(
*Ascendant runs from HML
<Iskra> Iiii could try though it would be useful to know what it would be mailing
*HyperMetalLugia slaps Ascendant
<Ascendant> well I sort of understood it @ n2
*HyperMetalLugia slaps Ascendant
*HyperMetalLugia slaps Ascendant
*HyperMetalLugia slaps Ascendant
<Ascendant> but I don't think i'm good enough to write a script for it
<Ascendant> and Iskra it's just for mailing passwords and username etc. for a service

<MajinMew> scroll down for more
<[MI]Fluorine> Fail situation
<Armageddon> what does it say? I cbf to load on proxy
<Ascendant> thanks
<steff12321> k
<Ascendant> n2 explained about smtp and everything
<Ascendant> and mail protocols
<MajinMew> herp no one can akick ellie didnt do it serebii doesnt care shuttup
<Soyuz> Armageddon; Also
<MajinMew> And I'm supposed to magically know the access defaults were changed?
<MajinMew> Give some thought to this: If a sop has no access to akicks, then only Joe does. And if he didn't set it (almost obvious since he doesn't suck with grammar and capitalization, akick message has some) then who did?
<MajinMew> Instead of immediately protecting Ellie, shouldn't you be more focused on saying, "MajinMew, it wasn't Ellie, it was _____, and you were akicked because ______."? As I said previously, I assumed it was Ellie. If I'm wrong, figure out who then.
<MajinMew> I chose to accuse Ellie because: One, she does have enough access to add and view akicks if the defaults are there, and I doubt they're not. Two, another user mentioned Ellie takes care of the akicks now, in fact quite a few have. Three, I've seen her abuse before myself. I'm not going to dig up logs, do that yourself if you don't believe me.
<Armageddon> ?
<MajinMew> And since when are network staff useless? Who the **** else are you going to cry to when you're under botnet attack? Make your own network and do everything yourself if you find them too "useless."
<Soyuz> Would the Dark Brotherhood take any advantage say
<Soyuz> the Empire fell
<Soyuz> and basically Chaos was ruling Tamrieal
<Soyuz> or Tamerial
<Espeon> Only thing that could be worse than Serebii would be a site full of elitists
<Espeon> oh wait
<Soyuz> *Tamriael
<Espeon> I'm getting too tired to use logic now.
<Armageddon> XD Xeli
<Espeon> inb4 then taking that as a botnetting threat
<Armageddon> well probably Soyuz
<Espeon> them_:
<Armageddon> heh
<Armageddon> if they got botnetted on their own network they'd be like "WTTTTF STOP LEAVING EVERYONE"

<eXAKR> Well
<eXAKR> I think I said it yesterday
<eXAKR> Make a Windows Sound Scheme
<Chimera> oh cool
<eXAKR> Yeah
<Soyuz> ah
<Soyuz> I seriously hate my computer
<Soyuz> and this virus I have
<Soyuz> infact
<Soyuz> It's completely destroyed my entire connection to the regular serive
<Soyuz> *server
<Soyuz> with my backround stating it has an infection
<Soyuz> MajinMew; so how do I fix
<Soyuz> hey Griggs
<Griggs> hi
<Soyuz> Do you have any advice on getting rid of a fucking anoying virus
<Soyuz> that changes you're backround into 'YOU HAVE A VIRUS'
<Soyuz> and basically maleware can't do shit
<Soyuz> and since I'm on safety network
<Soyuz> so Griggs?
<Griggs> oh
<Griggs> uh
<Griggs> boot in safe mode with networking
<Griggs> then go to norton
<Soyuz> I am in safemode
<Soyuz> Norton?
<Soyuz> norton is..what?
<Griggs> anti-virus
<Griggs> you've never heard of norton?
<[MI]Fluorine> ^
<Soyuz> No
<Soyuz> tell me how to get to norton
<Soyuz> or if its downloadable
<[MI]Fluorine> You get it free with comcast :p
<Soyuz> :|
*Ray yawns
*Ray goes to sleep on eXAKR's head
<Griggs> norton.com
<Soyuz> and it'll install in safe mode?
<Griggs> seriously i can't believe you've never heard of it
<Griggs> it won't install
<Griggs> it'll do a scan
<Soyuz> http://buy.norton.com/freetrial?ctry=US&lang=EN&selSKU=21138422&ptype=cart&trf_id=symcom&inid=us_hho_downloads_nav2011_trial_to_storet
<Soyuz> this?
<Griggs> yeah
<Griggs> except
<Griggs> there'
<Griggs> actually google norton 360 trial
<Griggs> because with that you have to enter your credit and crap
*eXAKR sweeps Ray off his head
<Soyuz> So
<Soyuz> Does malwarebytes suck ass
<Soyuz> or is it because this virus is more complicated than it?
<Griggs> i don't use it, so i can't say
<Soyuz> And norton will remove the virus, in what time frame?
<Griggs> malware-bytes might be for trojans rather than viruses
<Griggs> i don't know
<Griggs> that depends on your download speed and on your computer speed
<Soyuz> then it can't find this Trojan then
<Aristeo> rawr
<Soyuz> which is in c:\ ginger something
<Jason> :O
*Jason eats
<Jason> hey
<Soyuz> do you know anything about that?
<Griggs> There's too many viruses and trojans for me to know any paticular one
<Griggs> unless it was famous
<Griggs> though c:\Ginger doesn't sound like something a malware would hide in
<Griggs> it usually hides itself
<Soyuz> well I've tried Malware twice in safe mode
<Griggs> it probably has some files in system32, and intered itself into your registry
<Soyuz> the virus completely took over the regular
<Aristeo> hey!
<Soyuz> thats where they'd usually be
<Jason> whats up?
<Soyuz> Griggs; it doesn't work
<Soyuz> in safe mode
<Soyuz> it wants me to do it in regular mode
<Soyuz> the one thats fucking infected
<Soyuz> Does Windows Defender do anythig?
<Soyuz> hell does anything do anything
<Soyuz> Griggs
<Soyuz> o3o
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Quanyails> 7'sup?
<Chimera> Quany~
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Chim.
*Chimera nomz
<Griggs> oh
<Griggs> wait
<Griggs> huh
<Griggs> try to do a system restore
<Steve> 12 Hello, ixr and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Griggs> how'd you get the virus?
<Griggs> http://service1.symantec.com/support/nav.nsf/docid/2005041911281506?Open&src=tranus_con_br
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Soyuz> was searching through internet
<Griggs> and?
<Quanyails> 7I think I've found a style that incorporates both my drawing stylel and spriting style.
<Soyuz> Griggs; so do I have to download that norton Anti-virus
<Soyuz> and nothing, really
<Soyuz> its like when I got an unknown hard error
<Soyuz> was searching through deviantart
<Soyuz> got one of the 'download' options
<Soyuz> and that means
<Soyuz> virus got through
<Quanyails> 7-l
<Chimera> k
<Soyuz> Griggs; How do I do that system restore when it means "go to taskbar"
<Griggs> what os is it
<Quanyails> 7Of course, my odd mentality has me that I have to decide on all sorts of alternate directions my art goes.
<Quanyails> 7!generate 1 7
<Quanyails> 7Script still hasn't been re-added?
<Soyuz> 'os' meaning original system?
<Griggs> operating system
<Griggs> vista? 7? xp?
<Soyuz> HP Vista I believe
<Soyuz> though it might be an GP
<Soyuz> *HP
<Griggs> HP isn't an OS
<Griggs> it's a manufacturer
<Soyuz> I know, but its a Vista I believe
<Soyuz> 64 bit
<Griggs> oh ok
<Griggs> come to think of it
<Griggs> in safe mode it's all 2000 theme isn't it
<Griggs> go to your control panel
<Griggs> and i forget how to get to system restore from there
<Griggs> it's under system or something
<Griggs> i can't remember on that damn 2000 theme
<Soyuz> yeah its on the 2000 theme
<Soyuz> except a black backround

<Ascendant> VNC > TeamViewer
<Chimera> Go look for your cards while you're there
*Chimera runs
<Chimera> Oh?
<Chimera> I should set up a VNC with my computer :E
<Ascendant> D
<nickstr> VNC needs ports open and requires complex router configuration
<Ascendant> XD
<nickstr> Team Viewer does not
<Ascendant> Not really nickstr
<Chimera> yes
<Ascendant> but VNC lags less
<nickstr> yes it does
<Chimera> hm
<Chimera> cool
<nickstr> VNC requires special configuration of your router
<Ascendant> ubuntu is a retard
<Chimera> How so
<Chimera> :V
<Ascendant> we tried opening ports to Sneas' computer
<Ascendant> but it wouldn't work
<Chimera> oh wiw'
<Chimera> *wow
<Ascendant> while it did towards Bygios'
<Ascendant> all the config was correct
<Ascendant> and 6667 was working
<nickstr> you are required to open ports and in some configurations you can have problems involving accessing said open ports from the internet
<Ascendant> but no other ports would
<Ascendant> nickstr no ports were working except for 6667
<Ascendant> so itw as like wtf
<Chimera> That's odd Ascendant
<Ascendant> it is
<Chimera> Ports are open for me
<Chimera> o_o
<Ascendant> we ended up using TeamViewer
<nickstr> that is when you use Team Viewer
<Chimera> on ubuntu
<Chimera> What version did you have?
<Ascendant> dunno
<Ascendant> you'll have to ask Sneas

<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Soyuz> in C drive
<drf|laptop> 03the screw that holds it together
<Soyuz> tried Malwarebytes in Safe mode
<drf|laptop> 03I went to fix something and lost the screw
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Soyuz> doesn't work
<drf|laptop> 03you know where the MicroSD card goes in?
<drf|laptop> 03on Supercards, it's spring loaded
<Soyuz> Norton won't instlal
<drf|laptop> 03as in, push down and it pops out
<drf|laptop> 03the spring broke.
<drf|laptop> 03so I had to rip it out.
<Soyuz> and Microsoft Defender Doesn't do crap
<drf|laptop> 03now it's just like the CycloDS, you just insert the card, no spring.
<Chimera> ah
<Chimera> K
<Soyuz> my backround on normal says 'YOU GOT A VIRUS'

<Soyuz> and I'm grateful
<Armageddon> never gotten it
<drf|laptop> 03as for the GBA card
<drf|laptop> 03it uses MiniSD
<Armageddon> do you have a live boot CD?
<drf|laptop> 03which is a fricking bizarre standard
<drf|laptop> 03would you need this MiniSD to full size SD adapter/
<drf|laptop> 03]?
<Soyuz> first
<Soyuz> what is that
<Soyuz> second
<Armageddon> best way is to boot into linux
<Soyuz> I think so
<Soyuz> I
<Soyuz> do
<Chimera> Probably
<Chimera> Well
<Soyuz> not
<drf|laptop> 03it only supports 1 or 2GB cards, I'll give you 2GB with it
<Soyuz> have
<Armageddon> then remove the virus files via that
<Soyuz> Linux
<drf|laptop> 03with ROMs and crap too
<Chimera> I had a microSD to miniSD somewhere...
<Armageddon> lol
<Soyuz> Vista
<Chimera> But idk where it is
<drf|laptop> 03see
<Soyuz> 64 bit
<Chimera> So just send the minisd
<drf|laptop> 03this is MiniSD to full SD
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Chimera> :E
<drf|laptop> 03I get what you're saying
<drf|laptop> 03k
<Soyuz> unless all vistas have a linux
<drf|laptop> 03yeah I'll just send this
<Armageddon> live boot into the linux CD
<Chimera> :3
<Armageddon> ._.
<drf|laptop> 03lemme check something
<drf|laptop> 03if there are files on it XD
<Chimera> You're so nice sometimes :P
<Soyuz> Erm, explain
<Soyuz> Since you're making no entirely of any sense
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03if you can get the stupid DLDI to work
<drf|laptop> 03for REIN
<drf|laptop> 03then go for it
<drf|laptop> 03until then, no DS save dumping :/

<HyperMetalLugia> Justin Bieber loves America and of course all the fans he has here, but the Canadian-born singer has no plans of ever becoming an American citizen. Justin states, "You guys are evil. Canada's the best country in the world. We go to the doctor and we don't need to worry about paying him, but here, your whole life, you're broke because of medical bills. My bodyguard's baby was premature, and
<HyperMetalLugia> now he has to pay for it. In Canada, if your baby's premature, he stays in the hospital as long as he needs to, and then you go home."

<Theguesst> goes well
<Umbreon> 12i wish i can say the same
<nickstr> <Creideiki> Sounds like my grandmother-who-still-is-a-Nazi. But slightly worse. <-- SEIG HEIL!
<Theguesst> Still ill?
<Umbreon> 12my mother died feb 11th to cancer
<Theguesst> Oh
<Umbreon> 12and i have an aunt that has gone completely off the deepend and i'm afraid of what she might do
<Theguesst> Sorry
*Sneas hugs Umbreon :<
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Umbreon> 12murr..
<HyperMetalLugia> Wha
<HyperMetalLugia> What
*HyperMetalLugia goes off for his usual ice + drink
<Theguesst> Wish I could do something for you
<Umbreon> 12don't worry about it
<Umbreon> 12unless if you have ties to the mafia and can put a hit out on my aunt
*Umbreon hides
<Theguesst> Maybe you should talk to your aunt
<Quilava> wait what
<Umbreon> 12no you have no idea how loopy she has gone
<Theguesst> You know, keep the family together with what you have left
<Umbreon> 12she thinks her name is the name of her mother and that her real mother is her mothers sister
<Umbreon> 12and she is threatening my father behind his back
<Theguesst> is she getting help?
<Umbreon> 12no
<Theguesst> Why?
<Umbreon> 12we called the police to discuss her behavior and they can't do anything
<Theguesst> She obviously needs psychiatric assistance
<nickstr> sorry could not resist
<Umbreon> 12what i think she needs is to stop abusing drugs
<Theguesst> And that
<eXAKR> resist what?
<Theguesst> People do despirate things in emotional times
<Umbreon> 12she is obviously crazy and with how angry she is with my father she'll probably do anything
<eXAKR> Anyway Chimera
<eXAKR> I hope you can get the BW interface sounds quickly for me
<Theguesst> You just need to stay together with what you have left of your family
<nickstr> the Nazi reference
<Umbreon> 12after mother died
<Chimera> Not at the moment :/
<Chimera> hmmmm....
<Umbreon> 12we pretty much pulled the entire family together
<Chimera> Actually, I might!
<Chimera> eXAKR
<Chimera> Get teamviewer
<Chimera> NOW
<Umbreon> 12from all over the country
<Umbreon> 12members we weren't in touch with and all that so yeah the family is stronger than it was before
<Umbreon> 12with my aunt or without
<Theguesst> Be thankful for what you do have
<Umbreon> 12i'm too afraid of what might happen in the future to be thankful
<eXAKR> OK
<eXAKR> oo
<Garochi> 12meow?
<Chimera> :3
<Chimera> yes Garochi
<Chimera> Meow
<Chimera> :3
<Garochi> 12yay
<eXAKR> http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx <- This?
<Theguesst> Well try
<Chimera> yep
<Umbreon> 12heh
<Umbreon> 12how goes Quilava
<Theguesst> I can't say I understand because I've never had something this tragic happen to me, but the best I can do is offer some assistance
<eXAKR> ÒK Installing
<Theguesst> I'm here for ya
<eXAKR> Done
<Umbreon> 12thx..
<Umbreon> 12but don't feel obligated
<eXAKR> Now what do I do?
<Umbreon> 12i kind of lost a friend over this already
<Umbreon> 12he thought i was only going to him for comfort and nothing else, then got ticked off and cut contact with me
<Quilava> well then he clearly wasn't a very good friend :|
<Umbreon> 12:/
<Quilava> and I'm ok
<eXAKR> Get an account?
<Theguesst> Clearly
*eXAKR pokes Chimera
<Theguesst> A true friend would never abandon anyone, especially now
<Umbreon> 12good to hear Quilava
<Quilava> just bored out of my mind
<Theguesst> do you want to get off this topic?
<Umbreon> 12yes a little
<Theguesst> Okay then
<Umbreon> 12thx
<Umbreon> 12pokemon is also going dumb for me
<Umbreon> 12this set pretty much changes nothing for the metagame
<Theguesst> Legends?
<Umbreon> 12lost world decks are crap
<Umbreon> 12yes
<Chimera> hi
<Chimera> sorry
<Theguesst> Gengar is the only thing that works
<Chimera> Open up TeamViewer
<Umbreon> 12not really
<eXAKR> Opened
<Theguesst> Otherwise, lost world IS crap
<eXAKR> Got an account in the meantime
<Chimera> k
<Chimera> PM me
<Umbreon> 12my friend made an absol/chatot/mime jr. deck that is effective
<Theguesst> I can't see it any more effective than gengar
<Umbreon> 12not as effective as gengar but still decent
<Theguesst> Yea
<Umbreon> 12thing is though that gengar loses to SP horribly
<Umbreon> 12since it's so easy to tech a weavile in
<Sneas> 03Weavile :3
*Sneas hides
<Theguesst> I'm thinking about making a 3rd deck
<Theguesst> out of random
<Theguesst> arceus
<Umbreon> 12i have luxchomp, dialgachomp, lostgar, and that absol deck together
<Umbreon> 12and unown question mark
<Umbreon> 12which still remains my favorite deck
<Theguesst> I already have 1/2 the components
<Umbreon> 12i wonder if i'll ever get all the cards for it
*HyperMetalLugia dozes off
<Theguesst> Maybe
<HyperMetalLugia> Nighttimes~
<Theguesst> Night hml
<Umbreon> 12unown isn't a deck that is designed to win
<Umbreon> 12it's basically supposed to piss your opponent off
<Theguesst> It's designed for annoyance
<Theguesst> yep
<Umbreon> 124 Unown ?
<Umbreon> 124 Unown F (fake pokepower)
<Theguesst> X
<Umbreon> 124 blaine's quiz 1, 4 blaine's quiz 2, 4 blaine's quiz 3
<Theguesst> lol
<Umbreon> 124 misty's duel, 4 team galactic's wager
<Theguesst> XD
<Theguesst> Quick, think for once
<Umbreon> 12this is my favorite part
<Theguesst> Thats an awesome concept for a joke deck
<Umbreon> 12are you familiar with unown Q's power?
<Theguesst> free retreat
<Theguesst> yea
<Umbreon> 12sorry not Q
<Umbreon> 12i mean ?
<Theguesst> Yes, I used ? 2 years ago
<Umbreon> 12ahh
<Umbreon> 12well i play 1 of every type of pokemon in the deck
<Umbreon> 12without their basic form
<Theguesst> Evil
<Umbreon> 12and blaine's quiz 3
<Umbreon> 12you know what that does right?
<Theguesst> Not that one
<Theguesst> No
<Umbreon> 12you put a pokemon face down on the table
<Umbreon> 12you declare the name of an attack it has and they have to guess what the name of the pokemon is
<Umbreon> 12if they get it wrong you draw 3 cards, if they get it right they draw 3 cards
<Umbreon> 12well there are 5 different pokemon in the deck with the same attack
<Umbreon> 12XDD
<Theguesst> hidden power :p
<Umbreon> 12no
<Umbreon> 12the original sets Jolteon, Flareon, and Vaporeon all have Quick Attack
<Umbreon> 12and the neo discovery Espeon and Umbreon also have Quick Attack
<Theguesst> Ooooooh
<Umbreon> 12then i play the platinum lucario
<Umbreon> 12and the base set wigglytuff
<Umbreon> 12so there are 2 pokemon who have "do the wave"
<Theguesst> 1 thing though
<Theguesst> anything not from D/p and up is BROKEN
<Theguesst> Aerodactyl fossil set
<Theguesst> no evolving
<Theguesst> EVER
<Umbreon> 12already have an unlimited deck with that
<Umbreon> 12i play it with the unseen forces ursaring
<Umbreon> 12so their basics can't attack or use powers
<Theguesst> So does my friend -_-
<Umbreon> 12and btw
<Umbreon> 12rare candy breaks out of aerodactyl
<Umbreon> 12that's why the old dark vileplume is also in my build
<Theguesst> Why not new vileplume?
<Theguesst> Same difference
<Umbreon> 12the way it works
<Umbreon> 12is before DP
<Umbreon> 12if a card says "trainers" it means supporters, stadiums and trainers
<Umbreon> 12after DP if it says "trainers" it only effects trainers
<Theguesst> ok
<Theguesst> This is why sets dont mix
<Umbreon> 12because before DP supporters were a type of trainer
<Umbreon> 12what
<HyperMetalLugia> hah
<Sneas> 03lol Nugget Bridge
<HyperMetalLugia> In BW?
<Sneas> 03wut
<Sneas> 03It's in Kanto

<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Anyways, off to sleep for realz
*Quilava flops
*Garochi lays down next to Chimera
<Garochi> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> Garochi, you are a 9Chimecho.
*Umbreon looks at Quilava
<Umbreon> 12having a feline char is weird
<Quilava> being bored all day sucks
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<Umbreon> 12it does
<Umbreon> 12so boring that i got an exercising machine thing lawl
<Quilava> :/
*Chimera pets Garochi the chimecho :3
<Garochi> 12purr
<Quilava> if I weren't so lazy I could be doing something productive
<Chimera> :3
<eXAKR> One of these days I'm going to go mess with Chimera's computer through TeamViewer
*eXAKR hides
<eXAKR> and lol I thought 1920x1080 is the standard pretty much nowadays.
<Chimera> orly
*Garochi is a kitty
<Garochi> 12not a chime
<nickstr> its not
<eXAKR> How so nickstr?
<Umbreon> 12i will just exercise a little so i don't turn into pudding
<nickstr> well there are a number of monitors that are 1280x800 or even 1024x600 for tablets
<Quilava> I'm too lazy to do that even
<nickstr> you only see 1920x1080 on the big monitors
<eXAKR> hmmm
<nickstr> on the smaller ones it makes text difficult or even impossible to read usually
<eXAKR> I do have a reason for big ones
<Umbreon> 12D:
<nickstr> with the exception of displays such as Apple's Retina
<Umbreon> 12you can draw
<eXAKR> I do some photography work sometimes
<eXAKR> And no I don't find text impossible to read here
<nickstr> for that I could justify the purchase of a big monitor
<nickstr> its because yours was designed for 1920x1080
<eXAKR> Hmmm?
<eXAKR> Oh native resolutions
<nickstr> right
<eXAKR> That's a whole different league
<nickstr> native resolutions determine the "standard"
<eXAKR> Well, most monitors should be either 1920x1080 or 1680x1050 nowadays
<nickstr> well no
<eXAKR> Except for notebooks, where it's smaller
<nickstr> at the bare minimum what you need for browsing the internet its a width of 1024
<eXAKR> I have seen 13xx x 768 on a notebook
<nickstr> you are acting like 100% of computer users need 1920x1080
<nickstr> that is not true
<Quilava> like I said... I could be doing something productive
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<Quilava> but likely not going to :/
<eXAKR> I thought it was pretty much standard already
*Chimera pets bree
<Chimera> :2
<Chimera> :3
<nickstr> it is not standard
<eXAKR> So what's the standard mid-range nowadays?
*Chimera rolls

<Aurora> 6DO IT
<Chimera> k
<Chimera> When I get home :V

<Chimera> Blue is also a gym leader though, so |D

<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm gonna take a shot at IN again
<Roara|Touhou> 6cuz
<Chimera> k
<Roara|Touhou> 6I got to mokou's third card
<Chimera> I can spend a day trying to crack a .sseq file so I can add loop points if you want
<Chimera> :P
<Chimera> Do you want the rival music like in Emerald or the champion music like in R/S
<Chimera> ?

<Chimera> A nintendo DS sequence file
<Ascendant> then a 7d for doing it again and a 30d for ban evading
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> probably still hasn't expired
<junh1024-XD> o

<Chimera|zzz> The HEX isn't an editor- it

<Chimera|zzz> I dunno WHY...
<Chimera|zzz> But you look at the hex as a base, pay attention to the offsets of the files, and go to them in your HEX editor

<eXAKR> Then how do you put the edited files back in?

<lightumbreon> ugh, nintendo just couldn't leave it....code from more that a dozen of characters long.....
<lightumbreon> hate that in older Nintendo games

<Garochi> 12at the bright side
<Garochi> 12with passwords that long
<Garochi> 12yeah
<lightumbreon> for continuing on a level? no thanks
<Iskierka> perhaps they needed to be that long to encode all the data?
<Espeon> Eon.
<lightumbreon> lol, dumb people need, not that that is a problem
<Iskierka> the passwords generally store info about how you've done previously, how many lives etc. you have, as well as the level, so they can't be pre-defined short passwords
<lightumbreon> i mean for continuing a level, not for saving data
<lightumbreon> in the older games
<lightumbreon> for NES, SNES ETC.
<Iskierka> and do these continues also start with the same number of lives, ammunition (if applicable), etc?
<lightumbreon> nope, only the level and standard supplies
<Iskierka> if that's true then yes they are being silly but I suspect that it would want to hold on to things which would have to be in the password. Not even score?
<lightumbreon> not even the score

<HyperMetalLugia> WB :3
<nickstr> its been the secrecy, the over regulation, the un-necessarily heavy emphasis on cursing even when +G is set all of this has begun to take its toll
<Sakuya> again
<Sakuya> What
<nickstr> the kill script for cursing
<nickstr> +G is set
<Sakuya> People don't seem to understand something
<nickstr> so what is the point?
<Sakuya> This site had always had a strict no swearing policy
<junh1024-XD> dis place is mean to be :kid friendly:
<Chimera> Sakuya
<Chimera> Nice image :P
<Sakuya> I apparently am the only person trying to keep this chau
<nickstr> setting +G filters that stuff otu
<nickstr> (out
<Sakuya> Chat
<Chimera> @ your dA upload
<Sakuya> At tst
<nickstr> sort of an FYI
<Chimera> I didn't reply when you posted it because I was away sorry :V
<Sakuya> The swear kill will remain
<nickstr> its stupid
<nickstr> and un-necessary
<Sakuya> Then leave
<Sakuya> It remains
<nickstr> +G removes any word matching its dictionary for cursing
<nickstr> it prevents anyone from seeing the expletive
<Chimera> Those words, however, aren't used for more than swearing anyway
<Sakuya> If you have the need to swear
<Sakuya> Leave
<Chimera> There's more than 1 word for a subject more times than none :|
<Sakuya> The kill remains
<Chimera> Why not just a swear block and no kill? :E
<Chimera> I mean
<drf2> 03*WB02(Kosovo02)03WB* - <Kosovo> Oreos, floofburds, and killer octopi...what more can you ask for?
<Chimera> typoes happen
<Chimera> and I is next to O...
<Sakuya> Kill remains
<Sakuya> End of story
<Chimera> Kinda extreme, but whatever :V
<Sakuya> If it was a mistake, you simply rejoin the chat
<nickstr> its too extreme
<Sakuya> Its not hard
<nickstr> do you even know what +G does?
<Sakuya> You just told me >>
<Chimera> no it's not hard
<nickstr> you don't seem to understand its function
<Chimera> it's just a little annoying |3
<nickstr> if you are so adamant about the over the top kill
<junh1024-XD> mb, a kick instead? because i often have trouble reconnecting after a kill
<Sakuya> let me get on my computer
<junh1024-XD> because of unstable computers/dns pool/etc
<Chimera> yeah what junh1024-XD said
<Sakuya> You two are ticking me off
<Chimera> o.o;
*Betowolf wants to confess something as part of his babyfur self >.>
<Chimera> What the heck am I doing?
<nickstr> a kick sounds more fair
<Chimera> I'm not saying "remove the kill," I'm just saying a kill seems a little bit harsh. A kick doesn't o.o;
<Betowolf> but first people should get along in here ._.
<nickstr> it is a bit too harsh
<drf2> 03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
<Aurora> now that you've successfully dragged me on here
<Aurora> 6the kill script remains
<Betowolf> hey, Aurora.
<nickstr> plus what jun said about instability stands
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Espeon10) 11WB10»11•. 10- WE FULLFILL EACHOTHER

<Aurora> 6it is harsh yes, but this site has remained with that kill ever since before I joined
<nickstr> the network has been highly unstable recently and its difficult or impossible to connect after a kill
<Aurora> 6articuno specifically told me yesterday when I emailed her
<Aurora> 6IT WILL REMAIN
<nickstr> because of DNS and routing issues
<Betowolf> havent been on here much to see you in a while :3
<Aurora> 6the day she ends this chat as a TST chat, will be the day I leave, and will be the day you lot have whatever you want
<nickstr> its not a good idea given the network instability
<Aurora> 6until then, she wants the kill script kept in place
<Espeon> Wait what
<Aurora> 6as of now, granted I probably missed it
<Aurora> 6I haven't seen ocean go down once
<Aurora> 6and am i correct in saying we now have the second server?
<nickstr> I have seen Ocean go down on a regular basis
<Aurora> 6ok, then what of the second server
<nickstr> unable to connect
<Aurora> 6>.>
<Aurora> 6the only reason I see this as a problem is if someone typos, as chimera said
<HyperMetalLugia> 64.32.1.34 ..?
*HyperMetalLugia checks his laptop
<Aurora> 6otherwise, it's your own fault for swearing when I just explained we keep a non-swearing rule
<nickstr> what about when the network is unstable?
<nickstr> and it takes up to a few hours to reconnect after a kill?
<Aurora> 6are you really going to die not being online for that time?
<nickstr> in order for this to work you have to have 100% stability of all servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year
<Marik> summoned Suijin
<junh1024-XD> its more like, 30mins or sth
<Marik> two to go :3
<nickstr> for the kill to be acceptable
<Hitler> lol
<Betowolf> yeah we have 2 servers for the silverings IRC right?
<Espeon> It's like the swearing kill is something new or something.
<Aurora> 6 5. No foul language please, it has occured in the past where young people on the site have been kicked off by their parents after seeing just one innappropriate bit of text. This rule has always been in place so please respect it.
<Aurora> 6this rule has ALWAYS been here lol
<nickstr> +G is enforcement enough for this
<nickstr> it prevents the offending text from being seen
<Chimera> <Aurora> are you really going to die not being online for that time? <-- Don't make fun of my addiction ;~;
*Chimera flees
<Aurora> 6IT SHOULD NOT BE SAID IN THE FIRST PLACE
<junh1024-XD> i know it has always been there, but because of recent events, this issue has been highlighted.
<Aurora> 6I JUST EXPLAINED THAT
<Aurora> 6ffs
<Aurora> 6if it's a typo, then I'm sorry
<Espeon> The solutions is simple
<Aurora> 6but still
<Chimera> <nickstr> it prevents the offending text from being seen <-- that's the POINT
<Espeon> don't swear
<Espeon> :D
<Aurora> 6the kill is here
<Aurora> 6what espeon said lol
<Chimera> Thank you Espy
<Chimera> :3
<junh1024-XD> this is not the only time that an old & previously accepted rule has been brought to attention because of a change of opinion. i have seen it happen elsewhere, too.
<Aurora> 6ok well
<Aurora> 6I'm sorry
<Aurora> 6but until Arti declares otherwise
<Aurora> 6this rule will remain
<Espeon> I mean, sure it's annoying to be killed and not being able to rejoin
<Espeon> but it's like swearing is something common. besides typos I have typed <censored > on purpose more than I've sweared lol
<nickstr> plus people are going to come up with workarounds for the kill script

<Hawkie> 07Hey.
<Aurora> 6but whatever
<Chimera> nickstr there already are
<Espeon> Well, that should be a 1 warn next ban kind of offense.
<Chimera> but
<Aurora> 6I've already stated things
<Chimera> how about we ignore this
<Hawkie> 07Hm
<Aurora> 6and yeah
<Espeon> I mean, myself I'm against censorship.
<Chimera> because this debate is retarded.
<Espeon> But if it's a rule
<Chimera> anyway AURORA FFFFFF
<Espeon> then it's a rule
<Skylands> 10lolol #SW
<HyperMetalLugia> Lololmorefail XD
<nickstr> I would be ok with this if the consequences did not result in a kill
<Skylands> 10nickstr is an arse :|
<Espeon> I'm just dumbfounded why my unbeatable logic didn't end it all.
<Damos> 13LOL
<Aurora> 6well

<Damos> 13I just thought of something
<Espeon> Well, don't swear then. There's so many more creative ways to let out your rage~
<Chimera> That plush is <3
<Hawkie> 07besides, if there
<Damos> 13Congradulations you just been promoted to censorship. Call right now
<Hawkie> 07was no kill then the rule wouldnt be enforced as strictly

<Hawkie> 07No.
<Aurora> 6kill remains
<Hawkie> 07We can't count on people actually caring
<Hawkie> 07kill will remain as a reminder of stronger consequences for continued repeating offenses
<Hawkie> 07really
<Hawkie> 07just don't swear and you're good.
<Aurora> 6as articuno said, I'm actually quoting this
<Aurora> 6if you feel the need to swear, don't be on this chat

*Nova just summons Stardust Dragon on Marik and calls it game :P
<nickstr> I am only here because I like some of the people on this channel and they ONLY show up here

<Chimera> :O
<Chimera> In international versions of the game, Pokémon names are displayed with only one capital letter, rather than having all capital letters prior to Generation V.
<Chimera> FINALLY
<Chimera> Now it doesn't look like tey
<Chimera> *they're screaming the Pokémon's name
<Chimera> XD
<drf|away> 03wait what
<drf|away> 03I thought Diamond/Pearl had just one capital
<Chimera> Actually it didn't
<nickstr> it did
<Chimera> it did?
<Chimera> I don't recall
<drf|away> 03I'm pretty sure it did
<drf|away> 03hence INTERNATIONAL versions
<Chimera> My Typhlosion still has "TYPHLOSION"
<drf|away> 03the American version already did that
<drf|away> 03UI dunno LOL
<drf|away> 03-U
<drf|away> 03anyway sigh
<Chimera> lemme check
<Chimera> :V
<drf|away> 03my router is being stupid
<drf|away> 03disconnected me from Xbox Live
<drf|away> 03i was busy playing Genesis games
<Damos> 13hey drfywefy
<drf|away> 03and getting achievement points
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya DRF
<drf|away> 03I'm only here for a minute
<Chimera> genesis ftw
<Chimera> <3
<drf|away> 03yeah ever heard of Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection>:?
<Chimera> nope
<drf|away> 03it's an Xbox 360 game
<Chimera> drf
<Chimera> all caps
<drf|away> 03I've hda it lying around
<Chimera> sorry :V
<drf|away> 03but never bothered to do anything about it
<drf|away> 03heh
<drf|away> 03well real pros nickname their Charizard "Charizard" without all caps
<Chimera> hur
<drf|away> 03so I dunno what the default had
<Chimera> CHARIZARD
<drf|away> 03yeah i realize that
<drf|away> 03whatever
<drf|away> 03ffs
<drf|away> 03why doesn't the shift key work when I want it to
<Chimera> :V
<drf|away> 03not used to using my laptop LOL
<Chimera> I dunno
<drf|away> 03but I wasn't gonna bring my whole desktop home just for a 1-week break
<drf|away> 03so whatever
<Chimera> :P
<Chimera> In addition to this, Pokémon transferred from IV with their original all-caps name are converted to this format.
<Chimera> I wonder if that applies to nicknames
<Chimera> Hi Drake
<drf|away> 03inb4 you try to transfer a Missingno and it borks
*drf|away runs
<drf|away> 03nah I know
<Drake> 04hi
<drf|away> 03though
<drf|away> 03there are actually "gen 4 missingnos"
<drf|away> 03also known as invisible shiny Bulbasaurs
<Damos> 13I have the 6 pack Genesis Collection
<Chimera> yep
<Chimera> also whoa
<drf|away> 03anyway
<drf|away> 03dude
<Chimera> A reduction in boxes in the Pokémon storage system from 18 to 8, giving players the ability to store only 240 Pokémon, the same as Generation I. Additional space is available once the player has placed one captured Pokémon in each of the 8 boxes, then receiving an additional 8 boxes for storage, bringing the total to 16. This cycle continues until the player finally has 24 boxes, for a storage total of 720 Pokémon.
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<drf|away> 03ever heard of the Motorola Xoom tablet
<Chimera> 720
<drf|away> 03apparently it was just launched yhesterday
<drf|away> 03-h
<Chimera> 720 POKEMON SPACES
<drf|away> 03I was playing with it at the Verizon store
<Chimera> x_x
<drf|away> 03see
<drf|away> 03stupid
<Chimera> also I saw it
<drf|away> 03In Diamond
<drf|away> 03I filled up 100% of my slots
<Chimera> Microsoft got sued LOL
<drf|away> 03why can't they just have unlimited
<drf|away> 03-_-
<Chimera> erm no
<Chimera> Motorola did
<Chimera> idk drf
<drf|away> 03why do they still have a fricking limit
<Chimera> Space limits?
<drf|away> 03I mean
<drf|away> 03Pokémon Ranch doesn't have a limit
<drf|away> 03you can dump all your Diamond/Pearl crap htere
<drf|away> 03so eh
<Chimera> I mean you can't have unlimited data
<Iskierka> there has to be some limit when the card has limited space
<Chimera> drf
<Chimera> Ranch DOES have a limit
<Chimera> but it's huuuuuuuuge
<drf|away> 03yes but they could still hold like 80 million Pokémon in less than 1MB
<Chimera> Because the Wii's data storage > DPPtHGSSBW
<Iskierka> actually, they couldn't
<Chimera> yeah
<Iskierka> because that would mean more than ten pokemon per bit
*Iskierka cough
<Chimera> to my knowledge, a .pkm file is what, 1mb?
<drf|away> 03no
<drf|away> 03not even close
<Chimera> k
<Chimera> erm
<drf|away> 03try about 7KB
<Chimera> ...oh yeah XD
<drf|away> 03anyway
<drf|away> 03http://www.amazon.com/Sonic-Ultimate-Genesis-CO-Xbox-360/dp/B001G3AZS2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1298679612&sr=8-1
<drf|away> 03that's what I've been playing
<Chimera> lemme open up a calculator
<drf|away> 03and i'm going to go back downstairs soon to continue
<Chimera> 1 mb is 1024 kb, right?
<drf|away> 03yes.
<Iskierka> 5 MB for 720 pokemon
<drf|away> 03still
<Iskierka> but, they also have to try balance functionality of the system
<drf|away> 035MB is tiny compared to the up to 256MB of storage on DS game carts
<drf|away> 03they could easily have a huge number stored and be fine
<drf|away> 03anyway
<drf|away> 03I don't care
<Iskierka> if they just let you store thousands willy-nilly, the system would become impossible to navigate
<drf|away> 03my Diamond filled up x.x
<drf|away> 03so basically like the GT
<drf|away> 03S
*drf|away hides
<drf|away> 03anyway
<Chimera> around 146 pokemon per megabyte
<Chimera> so
<Chimera> yeah
<drf|away> 03bbl I guess
<Chimera> k :<
<Marik> osnap, new opponent!
<drf|away> 03if LL comes on tell her I'm on Xbox Live
<Marik> MARIK VERSUS WEEVIL.
<drf|away> 03but she prolly will check there first
<drf|away> 03bye
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay
<HyperMetalLugia> Seeys
<Chimera> <Iskierka> if they just let you store thousands willy-nilly, the system would become impossible to navigate <-- exactly. This is why I don
<Chimera> 't understand complaining about "BAWW LIMITED SPACE"
<Chimera> You don't NEED to catch 'em all :E
<Chimera> But now you can... and more. You still don't need to though
<Chimera> :<
<Chimera> ahahaha this makes so much sense
<Chimera> When a Pokémon forgets a move in order to learn from a TM or HM, the move learned takes on the current PP of the move replaced by the new move. This is to prevent repeated usage of TMs and HMs for the purpose of PP restoration.
<Chimera> no really, I gave my Krookadile a TM for level ground (I think) and it ended up only giving half the max PP
<Chimera> I went wtf and went to a center; full PP
<Chimera> Rotom's other forms are now the type of their respective special move. <-- I dunno if this is good, bad, or... what o.o
*Chimera spazz
<Corevette789> It's always drug time
<Chimera> o-O
<Chimera> There's an event-exclusive TM what
<HyperMetalLugia> How Nintendo O.o

*Shadow_Lugia 6snirks.
<Marik> Desmume, now is not the time for your slowdown ):
<Shadow_Lugia> 6>v>
<Shadow_Lugia> 6<v<
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Eh, I won't go with gratuitous German.
<Creideiki> And infuriating people who do speak German is /hilarious/.
<Damos> 13I know go ahead and laugh
<Damos> 13have yo're laughs
*Damos LOL at himself
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I suppose if I were to use German, it'd be the closest to pejoratives I'll get.
<Marik> ..
<Marik> he told me to go home
<Jerry> hai guys. :3
<Marik> :I
<Creideiki> Hello.
<Garochi> 12hi Jerry
<Skylands> 10Heya Jerry
<Marik> wait what
<Marik> mysterious who at night
<Creideiki> Also I find utterly hilarious the people who mix up German pronunciation...
<Chimera> jerrah
<Jerry> hai creideki,Skylands and Chimera
<Damos> 13Creideiki thats works alot with us southern Germans
<Creideiki> Like the amateur play I saw, which contains the line "Nicht Schießen!" I'm sure as well as other instances of the word 'schießen.'
<Chimera> I don't speak German |D
<Creideiki> Now, the actors playing the Germans were native anglophones. :P
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Brb.
<Hitler> lolwat
<Garochi> 12Jerry
<Garochi> 12you say hi to all of them but you don't say hi to me, umbreon D:
<Jerry> hey Garochi!
<Creideiki> The play was supposed to be dramatic and serious. But honestly me and the other six people that speak German literally laughed out loud at "Nicht Scheißen!"
<Jerry> you'd be Umbreon?! :DDDDDDDD
<Garochi> 12yes
<Jerry> sorry, I didnt knew *tackleglomps*
<Garochi> 12eep..
<Jerry> how are you maaaan?
<Jerry> :D
<Garochi> 12i've not been coping well
<Jerry> why?
<Garochi> 12well for starters my mother passed away 2 weeks ago
<Marik> VERSUS SERENITY
<Jerry> oh,sorry to hear that
<Marik> i thought she was all sick or something
<Garochi> 12:/
<Jerry> but you'd be okay?
<Garochi> 12that's a silly question to answer
<Jerry> i guess..
<Garochi> 12because i have no choice but to be ok
<Creideiki> Capitalization: It's 00,01<sarcasm>mildly00,01</sarcasm> 04important.
<NightSeas> brb
<Jerry> you cant be unhappy forever,,
<Garochi> 12exactly.
<Jerry> yeah,so..try to do stuff that interests you.
<HyperMetalLugia> Oheya Jerry :o

*Jerry glomps a HML

<HyperMetalLugia> Yaay ;D
<Jerry> :)
<Chimera> ffffffffffffffFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<Chimera> I can't wait for B/W ;_;
<Chimera> Extralink <3
<Garochi> 12o-O
<Skylands> 10o-o
<SilverSonic> lol to be honest, i think Nintendo is making a bad business decision to release B/W before the 3DS
<Chimera> They kinda are :P
<Chimera> I wish that B/W would have at least 3DS support
<Chimera> like
<Chimera> actual 3D in the 3DS
<Garochi> 12well it's not
<Chimera> That would probably change it from a bad business decision to a pretty good one (even though they'd be getting less money than they would if they made it 3DS exclusive)
<Chimera> yeah :<
<nickstr> its like the Pokemon Gold Silver release
<Iskierka> it's not a bad business decision, it's a good one, because they can get lots of people to buy it before, then release a 3DS version after, and get even more money.
<nickstr> much like Crystal
<nickstr> that was Gameboy Color exclusive
<nickstr> where as Gold and Silver also worked on the Gameboy
<Chimera> ahaha
<NightSeas> Hia Jerry
<Chimera> <GerbilSoft> http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/02/26/005219/HarperCollins-Wants-Library-EBooks-to-Self-Destruct-After-26-Loans
<Chimera> <GerbilSoft> your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to develop a DRM scheme for library ebooks.
<Chimera> <GerbilSoft> this ebook will self-destruct in 26 loans
<Chimera> <Iskierka> it's not a bad business decision, it's a good one, because they can get lots of people to buy it before, then release a 3DS version after, and get even more money. <-- Pokémon Black version 3DS version

<Ascendant> Apparently this network is no longer really part of the site.
<Aurora> saying this because of what I said? or is there something else now
<Armageddon> Thanks XD

<Quanyails> 7At who, Rora?
<Armageddon> wait wtf
<Armageddon> Damos
<Armageddon> Why are you here again? o.o
<Armageddon> you never come here
<Quanyails> 7On one of my WikiWalks , if that's at me.
<Ascendant> Aurora, the chat link is no longer on the site
<Aurora> yep
<Ascendant> "Note: Because Lugia and I and so many of the founding chat members feel that this network has grown apart from the community's original values, you will no longer find us there.
<Aurora> wait where is that?
<Ascendant> If you are interested in talking to us or getting a feel for "original TST", let me know and I may consider inviting you into our private network. Please understand that I will NOT tolerate anyone who makes me or my friends feel uncomfortable there!"
<Skylands> 10On the chat page
<Ascendant> on the chat page that's been taken down
<Skylands> 10which was removed from the menu
<Ascendant> http://www.lugia.us/chat.htm
<Skylands> 10as well as peas
<Ascendant> yeah
<Quanyails> 7o_o
<Skylands> 10Except http://www.lugia.us/peas.htm no longer exists
<Aurora> 6peas exist o.o
<Garochi> 12o-o
<Quanyails> 7Erm...
<Quanyails> 7Huh.
<Aurora> 6go to misc.
<HyperMetalLugia> He just felt like it..?
<Skylands> 10Oh
<Espeon> Happy birthday. At least for me in the land of yesterday.
<Quanyails> 7Does it sound weird that it almost feels like Arti's abandoning this? O_o
<Ascendant> She has
<Ascendant> It's not the feel
<Ascendant> She really has abandoned it
<Aurora> 6I'll probably be next to go then
<Skylands> 10The fact she created a private server, yes Quan
<Ascendant> She abandoned it when she took the name WhiteTail
<Aurora> 6I actually specifically said today that I'll be leaving when this chat is no longer tst
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Aurora> 6so I probably wont be around much longer
<Quanyails> 7Well, that sorta stinks.
<Ascendant> It does
<Quanyails> 7TST was my first IRC and one of the best communities I've joined.
<Ascendant> It's changed so much from before the time when I was banned
<Quanyails> 7I'm speaking like I'm gonna leave already. O_o
<Ascendant> It's no longer...what it used to be
<Ascendant> the community was much different back then
<Espeon> Everyone speaks like it's dead already.
<Aurora> 6lol
<Espeon> Kinda silly imo.
<Espeon> :3
<Ascendant> It pretty much is
<Sneas> No you aren't, I am :3
<Quanyails> 7Well, it's dying as of now.
<Ascendant> it's been dying for months
<Aurora> 6well I dunno why everyone else is speaking of it
*Sneas runs
<Aurora> 6but me leaving is nothing new
<Aurora> 6I've dropped my activity over the past 3 months
<Ascendant> lol of course it isn't
<Aurora> 6unless that went unnoticed lol
<Ascendant> even LLOTS has left the main channel
<Ascendant> dropped from staff
<Skylands> 10he left the IRC
<Ascendant> yeah
<Skylands> 10entirely
<Skylands> 10except for his channel
<Armageddon> xD
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
*Quanyails 7asks the cause of this moribundity.
<Skylands> 10It's developed over time
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> !define moribundity
<Ascendant> What I don't get
<[TST]Bot> -!- No results found
<Aurora> 6k...
<Skylands> 10and recent events have triggered perish
<Aurora> 6define moribundity
<Quanyails> !define moribund
<[TST]Bot> -!- stagnant: not growing or changing; without force or vitality
<Aurora> 6oh
<Aurora> 6ok
<Quanyails> 7No, not exactly...
<Aurora> 6 well
<Ascendant> Is why you would choose to abandon this when it's no longer part of the site
<Aurora> 6you wont be getting the answer to that
<Aurora> 6only a few people know what triggered all of this
<Ascendant> It's still the community
<Quanyails> 7moribund: A person who is near to dying; Approaching death; about to die; expiring; Almost obsolete, nearing an end
<Damos> 13Happy Birthday Espeon
<Quanyails> 7If we open up the chat more, then I'm sure it can be more assimilated.
<Damos> 13sorry
<Damos> 13Late
<Aurora> 6wait, was that at me?
<Aurora> 6@ascendant
<Armageddon> Damos
<Armageddon> it's not Xeli's birthday
<Armageddon> xD
<Armageddon> read the topic lol
<Ascendant> Yes
<Aurora> 6basically
<Espeon> LOL
<Aurora> 6I've only remained here for the past month or so strictly because of my responsibility to the chat
<Aurora> 6I actually considered leaving long ago
<Mason> BON ANNIVAIRESAIRE ARMAGEDDON
<Sneas> OLO
<Hitler> HAPPY BIRTHDAY ARMAGEDDON
<Hitler> :D
<Ascendant> Well then, are you implying that you also don't like the chat?
<Aurora> 6I actually don't-
<Aurora> 6tbh
<Ascendant> The chat makes up most of TST's community tbqh
<Aurora> 6I have serious issues with this chat
<Skylands> 10I don't think anyone does.
<Mason> err
<Mason> ANNIVERSAIRE*
<Ascendant> As do most people
<Ascendant> But we all stay here because we have things in common
<Hitler> .
<Hitler> wat
<Ascendant> And we enjoy the company and chatter
<Aurora> 6serious issues i tend to ignore for the most part, by remaining idle
<Quanyails> 7It's decomposed to scripts.
<Damos> 13oO_Oo
<Ascendant> Indeed
<Aurora> 6scripts?
<Sneas> taw
<Armageddon> o_O
*Damos doesn't want anyone to leave
<Aurora> 6ok well, i guess the kill script yeh
<Armageddon> XD
<Quanyails> 7No?
<Aurora> 6that was fin today >.>
<Aurora> 6fun
<Aurora> 6efdgrt
<Quanyails> 7All the other scripts.
<Aurora> 6my point being
<Quanyails> 7The ones that emulate activity and socializing when there is none?
*HyperMetalLugia brbs and gets some ice
<Ascendant> I admit the scripts would have been my fault
<Espeon> There's no one saying one has to socialize with everyone just because we're in the same userlist.
<Ascendant> ^
<Aurora> 6well
<Damos> 13I don't know why people want to leave here. I only seen a few events that happened but that it
<Ascendant> Damos you haven't seen a lot then
<Skylands> 10Damos, because alot of information is private
<Aurora> 6my problem is just not getting along with some people in here
<Aurora> 6which, if that was the only reaosn, I'd still stay
<Damos> 13that be me?
<Aurora> 6a lot of things
<Quanyails> 7I find most of the people tolerable.
<Quanyails> 7Or neutral.
<Aurora> 6today/yesterdays swear argument a good example
<Ascendant> Well, ignore those people
<Ascendant> What about the others?
<Aurora> 6granted, it no longer matters since the chat is no longer tst
<Ascendant> it probably isn't
<Aurora> 6but BEFORE the removal of chat
<Damos> 13WHAT!
<Aurora> 6rule number 5, this site is a strict no-swear zone
<Espeon> Well, I've said my opinion on that.
<Aurora> 6as did I
<Aurora> 6I also defended the rule
<Espeon> no holds barred = people trying to look like INTERNET GANGSTERS all the time
<Damos> 13no don't get rid of TST please
<Damos> 13or the chat
<Aurora> 6but when even one of our mods didn't care about it
<Aurora> 6I take serious issue to that
<Ascendant> As have I.
<Aurora> 6but now it's just a meh
<Marik> http://i51.tinypic.com/2uejhmp.jpg
<Espeon> =s
<Marik> see this, wat do
<Aurora> 6since the rules are basically out the door
<Ascendant> heh Xeli
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Ascendant> just kick the user in question then
<Garochi> 12hi Espeon
<Espeon> I'm quite simply too polite to break rules unless they're incredibly unreasonable, lol.
<Espeon> Hi :3
<Quanyails> 7Perhaps we'll have to, if possible, bring TST's values back.
<Damos> 13this is all hitting me in the heart
<Damos> 13at once
<Ascendant> or forcibly bring the rule down on them
<Ascendant> you're an admin/mod
<Ascendant> if people hate you for reinforcing the rules
<Ascendant> then it's their fault
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Damos> 13I can't handle this
<Espeon> And people might go AAAW POWER ABUSE but really, if someone breaks the rules
<Espeon> ban them
<Espeon> a week or so
<Hitler> lol?
<Espeon> not even kidding
<Ascendant> You're only doing your job really
<Quanyails> 7And we've done so.
<Ascendant> holy crap lag
<Quanyails> 7As the meme goes, haters gonna hate.
<Ascendant> derp
<Espeon> The problem is obviously that some people never learn, yeah.
<Aurora> 6if you manage to bring tst's values back
<Ascendant> yeah
<Aurora> 6you'd be a god
<Aurora> 6literally
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<Ascendant> Well
<Aurora> 6I don't see this chat changing back
<Aurora> 6ever
<Ascendant> What do you think the values are?
<Quanyails> 7Note the lack of them in our topic.
<Espeon> How positive. And that's hypocrisy, I'm the one who says "I'm not negative, I'm just thinking realistically!"
<Aurora> 6lolol
<Steve> 12 Hello, Infamous_Zed and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Espeon> I'm a hypocrite* What I meant.
<Espeon> :3
<Aurora> 6course, I'm also running on a slight vent moment right now
<Ascendant> xD
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Damos> 13please everyone. Please lets try to at least fix this problem
<Aurora> 6might be a tad more negative than I normally am
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Ascendant> Aurora, what do you think the values are?
<Damos> 13Lots of us can't bear to see this split up
<Aurora> 6damos, a lot of it is already done if you haven't noticed
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Quanyails> 7'Love, friendship", that stuff?
<Ascendant> It's been dying for several months now
<Garochi> 12heh
<Aurora> 6there's a serious amount of tension in here lololol
<Ascendant> Well, the values are here, but there's more than just the values
<Ascendant> there is
<Ascendant> why wouldn't there be
<Ascendant> when the entire fate of the chat hangs by a thread?
<Espeon> Well, I'm pretty sure that I'm not a problem.
<Espeon> And heh
<Skylands> 10[21:16] <&Aurora> there's a serious amount of tension in here lololol <- Makes me think of the Cold War </random>
<Aurora> 6espeon, lol
<Iskierka> the chat isn't exactly being killed off, it's just being cut off from the main site.
<Quanyails> 7o-o
<Quanyails> 7o_o*
<Aurora> 6points to you for being one of the most level headed people I've EVER met
<Ascendant> exactly, Iskierka
<Quanyails> 7Yeah, but cutting off a limb will kill it from the original body.
<Ascendant> but cutting it-
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> Quan said it
<Damos> 13how do we make it part of the site again
<Quanyails> 7Allow more people to access it?
<Espeon> I just go with the logical option, all day erryday
<Soyuz> Armageddon's birth day wat
<Iskierka> it was already quite far from being part of the site, really
<Armageddon> xD
<Garochi> 12silly kitty
<Aurora> 6it was-
<Aurora> 6what Iskierka said
<Aurora> 6so few people even knew we had a chat, tbh this isn't doing much
<Aurora> 6a lot of this is just your guys' reactions to what some of us are doing lil
<Ascendant> Yeah, but the people who did know?
<Aurora> 6lol
<Aurora> 6they can still connect
<n2> better to have a small chat with good people than to be spp
<Aurora> 6it's not like we've torn down the chat entirely
<Espeon> LOL
<Ascendant> ewwwwwwwwwww do not even MENTION SPP
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Quanyails> 7But I prefer IRCs over other forms of online communication.
<Ascendant> god no
<Espeon> well that is true, as long as one doesn't approach the realms of elitism.
<Ascendant> ._.
<n2> or maybe you do want 400 people to join
<n2> and then you will have to hire mods who act like jackasses
<Espeon> Lol that never works out
<Espeon> NEVER
<Aurora> 6lol
<Espeon> just too many asdf
<nickstr> right
<Damos> 13I'm going to be crying in bed now because of this
<Espeon> .

<Damos> 13brb drink
<Ascendant> Damos you're acting as though the servers are going to be destroyed lol
<Aurora> 6well
<Ascendant> it's still here
<Ascendant> at least for a while...
<Aurora> 6seeing as i've successfully caused turmoil here LOL
<Ascendant> and now brb
<Aurora> 6I gotta go in like
<Aurora> 6a minute
<Espeon> Lol.
<Skylands> 10Hm
*Espeon also yawns
<NightSeas> brb
<Aurora> 6ffff
<Aurora> 6you made me yawn
<Espeon> :3
<Aurora> 6stupid worrrrrrd
<Damos> 13back
<Espeon> I still got it~
<Garochi> 12blah Espeon
<Garochi> 12my chest is sore
<Garochi> 12x-x
<Espeon> D:
<Damos> 13<Ascendant> Damos you're acting as though the servers are going to be destroyed lol< Thats what I am worried about.
<Garochi> 12i've been starting to work out on this thing that is supposed to work your abs
<Damos> 13I love TST so much
<Garochi> 12and it doesn't feel well XD
<Espeon> that reminds me of a pic but I can't even remember what was in it lol
<Damos> 13I don't want anything bad to happen to it
<Espeon> And =s Garochiiiiiiiii
*Garochi licks the kitty
<Garochi> 12i'm not concerned
*Espeon flops and lazies all over.
<Garochi> 12i don't think anything bad can happen from this
<Quanyails> 7Whoops, RL got me distracted from here.
<Skylands> 10Lol topic change and avoiding the problems at hand
<Quanyails> 7What'd I miss?
<Garochi> 12this is why i've been a bit unattentive
<HyperMetalLugia> A lot
<nickstr> a little bit of drama
<Aurora> 6ok well lol
<Espeon> More like BRB/GTG-fest, Sky.
<Skylands> 10k
<Garochi> 12this is one of the few times
<Iskierka> Damos the server isn't going to be destroyed, at least not from this
<Garochi> 12you'll see me as the positive one
<Garochi> 12i'm usually the pessimist
<Iskierka> it'll take something far worse to cause the server to be removed
<Garochi> 12better take screenshots
<Aurora> 6tbh I think you guys will be fine
<Damos> 13<nickstr> a little bit of drama< no NO
<Quanyails> 7I honestly would like to bring newbies here.
<Quanyails> 7Or more people in general.
<Aurora> 6quan
<Aurora> 6then advertise the channel or whatever
<Espeon> Newbies are cooldudes
<Espeon> Noobs, on the other hand...
<n2> nickstr knows all about drama
<Aurora> 6but we don't want to publically associate the channel with the forums anymore
<Aurora> 6ANYWAYS
<Quanyails> 7Possibly, if Arti just left it.
<Quanyails> 7Ah?
<Quanyails> 7I dunno, an IRC would die as well if there's nothing tethering it to the microcosm of the community.
*Skylands sighs
<NightSeas> ^
<HyperMetalLugia> I wish the !tstposts script was still here
<Skylands> 10The forums aren't much better than here
<Garochi> 12believe what you want but this is still a community
<Espeon> Lol.
<Garochi> 12TST liked or not
<Garochi> 12*linked
<Skylands> 10Yeah... community.
<Garochi> 12in it's basic concept
<Garochi> 12a community is a friendly group of people
<Garochi> 12*its
<Damos> 13no matter what goes. TST and chat will be spiritually linked forever
<Skylands> 10Friendly's definition has lost its lust, to say the least
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I feel as if half the people I was like, 'friends' with, aren't active.
<Skylands> 10Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Garochi> 12time will crush anything into dust
<Skylands> 10My friends were the older members
<n2> or turn into people like me/
<Espeon> About to say that nothing lasts forever, lol.
<Skylands> 10in which most left/drifted
<n2> leave for 3 years then mysteriously come back
<Damos> 13it does
<Espeon> Lol
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Quanyails> 7Our leave rate is larger than our join rate, no?
<Skylands> 10Absolutely
<HyperMetalLugia> Sure
<Quanyails> 7So what does that imply?
<Garochi> 12right now this isn't a bad thing
<HyperMetalLugia> 5000> members and less then 100 active by me guesses
<Skylands> 10It implies... well, every decision we've made up until not
<HyperMetalLugia> *mu
<Skylands> 10Good and bad decisions
<Skylands> 10now*
<Espeon> "6268 Total Members with 196 Active Members"
<Garochi> 12it's like draining inpurities
<Garochi> 12so what is left will be more pure
<Quanyails> 7o.o
*Soyuz dies
<Quanyails> 7So much as being the largest Lugia and bird community, eh?
<Damos> 13oh (LATE) Happy Birthday Armageddon
<Skylands> 10Half the people here aren't dedicated fans of Lugia/Articuno anyway
<Garochi> 12there aren't many lugia and bird communities out there
<Skylands> 10More than half, actually
<Damos> 13I'm sorry
<Garochi> 12i don't think you have to worry about being the largest :P
<Espeon> I'm not a dedicated fan of anything.
<nickstr> its sort of a niche
<Espeon> ... almost
<Quanyails> 7I joined for the community.
<Skylands> 10I joined for Lugia originally, but my interest in that Pokemo faded
<Skylands> 10Pokemon*
<Garochi> 12same
<Espeon> What Skylands said pretty much.
<HyperMetalLugia> I joined by random luck
<Espeon> Lugia -> Nothing -> ESPEON
<Espeon> yeah
*Damos pretends he doesn't hear that
<Garochi> 12are you saying lugia is better than nothing
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Garochi> 12but nothing is better than espeon?
<Espeon> Nooooo
<Garochi> 12hey
<Garochi> 12it's okay if you think espeon is the greatest thing since sliced bread
<Espeon> And lol, I totally found the place by chance. I actually signed up and went somewhere like a minute later. If I left for that a bit earlier, I wouldn't be here.
<Espeon> It's kind of fascinating.
<Espeon> How little random events dictate so much~
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Espeon> And good, now I know my thoughts are justified
<Quanyails> 7Tell that to WikiWalks. :P
<Espeon> What
<Espeon> inb4tl;dr
<Garochi> 12i found the place through another lugia site
<Garochi> 12i don't even think that site is still standing
<Skylands> 10YT, for me
<Espeon> Ze Google for me.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ze.. fanfics..
<Espeon> GOOGLE CONNECTING PEOPLE
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7I came here from:
<Quanyails> 7Lugia's Island, which came from Dragonfly Cave.
<Garochi> 12did google release their OS yet?
<Skylands> 10Quan, I've been wondering
<Skylands> 10Were you a member of LI?
<Skylands> 10At any point*
<Quanyails> 7Nope.avi
<Quanyails> 7Went on it when it was still alive.
<Espeon> and there it plays in my head
<Skylands> 10It's not alive at all now
<Skylands> 10Faltzer closed it
<Quanyails> 7And there we see a possible future.
<Ascendant> Lugia's Island no longer exists
<Espeon> It was in a zombie state for quite a while though.
<Quanyails> 7The creator died. What does that mean for the community?
<Ascendant> [13:25:05] <Garochi> believe what you want but this is still a community
<Ascendant> [13:25:06] <Espeon> Lol.
<Ascendant> [13:25:08] <Garochi> TST liked or not
<Ascendant> [13:25:18] <Garochi> *linked
<Ascendant> [13:25:33] <Skylands> Yeah... community.
<Ascendant> [13:25:50] <Garochi> in it's basic concept
<Ascendant> [13:26:02] <Garochi> a community is a friendly group of people
<Ascendant> I have to agree with that
<Espeon> I gotta say, haven't been many people with genuine
<Espeon> malicious intents here.
<Espeon> AS FAR AS I KNOW
<Espeon> WHich is very limited tbh
<Armageddon> XD
<Quanyails> 7Heh.
<Espeon> and no, noobs or trolls who just learned about 4chan are not "genuinely malicious" =P
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Soyuz> Armageddon
<Timmi> ;o
<Soyuz> watch the new skyrim trailer now
<Armageddon> no
<Armageddon> my internet can barely even load google
<Quanyails> 7So...
<Quanyails> 7What to make of this?
<Hitler> lol?
<Espeon> I'm not sure what will happen next.
<Ascendant> Going to make a topic on the forums
<Espeon> RUH ROH
<Ascendant> and fyi if you think that's a bad idea I don't care.
<Soyuz> Damnit
*Skylands doesn't
<Soyuz> You are missing gameplay footage that looks amazing :P
<Ascendant> obviously Espeon would lol
<Espeon> Wait
<Espeon> you took me seriously
<Espeon> Have you forgotten everything I've told you
<Ascendant> I wasn't ;p
<Skylands> 10Be careful though, NS
<Ascendant> "lol"
<Skylands> 10We don't want to cause wide panic
<Skylands> 10widespread*
<Ascendant> that's my specialty
*Ascendant mauled
<Ascendant> But okay
<Ascendant> I'll see what I can do
<Espeon> Wow it's like there's a shark loose near a beach or something
<Espeon> "don't cause panic"
<Ascendant> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Do it :D
<Espeon> It won't go anywhere.
<Skylands> 10Anyway, hurry with that topic because I gtg soon
*Skylands needs to wake up early to take her driving exam
<Espeon> Reminds me of how the first GTA IV trailer practically broke the internet for a while. UNINTENTIONAL DoS WHEE
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Espeon> Poor whoever hosted it, poor them.
<Espeon> Lol.
*Damos wishes Sky the best of luck
<Espeon> I'm tired and all but for some reason it's always around this time stuff happens
<Espeon> so yay weekend
<Espeon> and good luck skyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
<Quanyails> 7Hope it goes well, Sky!
<Armageddon> ._.
<Skylands> 10Thanks, Damos and Quan
<Quanyails> 7Well, communication is the first step.
<Skylands> 10and Xeli
<Skylands> 10(Didn't see your comment right away)
<Ascendant> good luck
<Espeon> =p
<Quanyails> 7Who was it that said that history will be remembered by the silence of something something?
<Garochi> 12hmm
<Ascendant> o-O?
<Soyuz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsJO7dmWT8
<Quanyails> 7MLK, it seems.
<Quanyails> 7Reassociation.
<Espeon> I will however agree that this trailer got some swag to it
<Chimera> yay
<Chimera> I just helped eXAKR get some sound effects from virtually any game on the DS
<Chimera> :>
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7Cool/
<Chimera> and in the process found out some stuff about .SSEQ files
<Chimera> I'm thinking of learning programming and writing a program to compose .SSEQ files that can loop in games
<Chimera> I need to get some programmers :V
*Chimera runs
<Espeon> For some reason people tend to think I know more about such stuff than I really do :B
<Espeon> NO
<Espeon> Nope.
<Ascendant> lol
<eXAKR> !espeon
*Espeon still belongs to Skylands for 15 more seconds
<Espeon> I'm just a guy with a black belt in the art of Google
<Espeon> 3[6!6espeon vars 4reset3]
<eXAKR> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to eXAKR for 20 minutes
<Soyuz> Espeon; swag? o3o
*Quanyails 7blinks.
<Quanyails> 7Knowing that a traditional black belt only means you've mastered the basics?
<Espeon> Oh okay, so a black belt which is the highest grade in some martial arts (even though there's several "levels" within it) is mastering the basics? Makes sense.
<Damos> 13well good night everyone I'm going to Bed
<Espeon> I assume people got the point of my obviously not serious post
*eXAKR forcibly owns Espeon forever
<Chimera> mew
<Quanyails> 7Well, first-level black belt.
<Quanyails> 7I'm studying probability. :P
<Quanyails> 7*non sequitur*
<Espeon> lol.
<Espeon> I HAVE NO IDEA
<Espeon> where that came from
<Espeon> looks good pretyt much
<Garochi> 12nothing wrong with that
<Soyuz> I love the song mostly
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope, just Damos and Arce..
<HyperMetalLugia> ...
<Soyuz> and believe since the trailer killed a drake
<HyperMetalLugia> We're screwed
<Ascendant> <Espeon> I'm just a guy with a black belt in the art of Google
<Ascendant> xD
<Soyuz> Our Drake went to go hang himself
<Garochi> 12you aren't a guy
<Garochi> 12you're a kitty
<NightSeas> Well, night everyone
<Garochi> 12night
<Espeon> I know that a lot of people assume I'm a girl just because of Espeon, but I'm very much a guyyyyyyyyyyyyy
<Espeon> Nini c:
<NightSeas> Night Bree :3
<Garochi> 12heh
<Espeon> Yes, you're still a bree!
<Garochi> 12eep
<Espeon> Kinda. I guess.
<Espeon> Fluffy
<Garochi> 12hi foxy
<SheenaFox> !Espeon
*Espeon still belongs to eXAKR for 12 more minutes
<SheenaFox> hi Garochi

<Garochi> 12o-O?
<Kosovo> hi shenna
<SheenaFox> hi kosvvo
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Quanyails> 7What does everyone else say about killing the game-like scripts?
<HyperMetalLugia> Do it
<Skylands> 10I say move them to #IRCGames
<Espeon> I can't really give input as I don't care :3
<Espeon> but if anything, move them to ircg-
<Espeon> even if that means deleting the OMGZ POINTS
<SheenaFox> Just take them out of SW, and join ircgames like Skylands said and Espeon tried to say
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<SheenaFox> -,
<Ascendant> Well, fyi I have a disable script active
<Quanyails> 7And the !username scripts?
<Quanyails> 7And the join/leave scripts?
<Ascendant> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ascendant, you are a 2Probopass.
<Quanyails> 7Well, just the join ones
<Ascendant> blah
<Ascendant> hang on

<SilverSonic> D;
<SheenaFox> !pokescram
<ScriptBot> Scrambled word is "ahvancra". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here). Type !pokehint, !pokehint2 or !pokehint3 for a hint.
<SheenaFox> um
<SheenaFox> for that one too?
<Ascendant> it's individual
<SheenaFox> oh
<Kyu> 07!pokeguess carvhana
<ScriptBot> Sorry that isn't right! Keep trying!
<HyperMetalLugia> You could make it notice the person instead maybe>
<Kyu> 07!pokeguess carhvana
<ScriptBot> Sorry that isn't right! Keep trying!
<Ascendant> !endscram
<Ascendant> !endpokescram
<ScriptBot> Ended the current game. Word was "carvanha". Better luck next time.
<Ascendant> !pokescram
<Kyu> 07oh fish

<SheenaFox> !pokescram
<Ascendant> I screwed it up though
<Ascendant> hang on
<Ascendant> !pokescram

<DeadCrab> yeah she does. i'll see if i can get her to come on
*HyperMetalLugia goes to refill his cup of ice, with sadness
<DeadCrab> nikki's ship is being decomissioned and parked in the field of the fallen

<n2> Don't copy that floppy!
<HyperMetalLugia> OH NO
<HyperMetalLugia> Not another TG .x.
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Ascendant> xD
<n2> when you use legal software, you will get licensing errors that locks you out of your server until you connect a console
<Ascendant> lol pfft
<Ascendant> it died

<Ascendant> xD
<Quanyails> 7Naw, it's different.
<Ascendant> well I'm not trying to annoy or offend anyone
<Ascendant> just stating the truth
<Ascendant> people need to know it
<Quanyails> 7This is creepily ironic. O_o
<Ascendant> it is
<Ascendant> as for the eleanor roosevelt quote
<Ascendant> I couldn't find the one where
<Ascendant> actions speak loudest or somethign

*Skylands clicks the post button
<Skylands> 10My response may have not been of much use, but eh
<Absol> well, a community that is most likely dying
<Ascendant> xD
<Skylands> 10Also, I edited your first post, NS
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Skylands> 10Adding a note not to lock/delete/move the topic
<Ascendant> now afk again
<Ascendant> Skylands I did that
<Ascendant> "To anyone who is offended, this is simply the truth. Do not go "BAWWWWWWWWWWWW YOU" if you do not like it. Also, anyone who decides to lock or delete this topic is simply denying reality. Don't be an idiot."
<Skylands> 10where?
<Skylands> 10well
<Skylands> 10I added another one
<Skylands> 10because people tend to forget after reading long paragraphs
<Armageddon> o-o
<Ascendant> k

<Skylands> 10...
<Skylands> 10Ascedant won't be able to view it then
<Skylands> 10Nor will whoever else that already knows about this
<Skylands> 10i.e. HML, Damos, etc
<Skylands> 10and I'm sure they want to give their input too
<Skylands> 10ffs
<Skylands> 10Espeon help me out

<Aristeo> THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Skylands> 10say that in #SW :P
<Espeon> I think this is something more than rcm's should be able to see.
<Espeon> But what does my opinion mean.
<Espeon> :3
<Skylands> 10D:
<Ray> 02I agree with Skylands
<Espeon> If isolated it will just be overfilled with negativity from people who are already determined to leave.
<Things> :D
<Skylands> 10^
<Absol> so hm
<Absol> what exactly is going on there
<Skylands> 10Absol, read it

<Absol> hm
<Absol> awards
<Absol> yay
<Absol> systems i hate
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Quanyails> 7Nice wording in that post, Espy.
<Absol> i'm commenting on something i noticed while i was on the forums, an awards system
<Absol> all of the awards look like petty bullshit that i'd equate to achievements
<Espeon> I kinda felt like saying "This is a site with a community, not a personal chatroom" but I kinda have a feeling that wouldn't be recieved too well.
<Espeon> YAY MOTIVATION FOR SPAM
<Absol> basically
<Absol> or lurk
<Espeon> Just another example of good in theory, not in practice.
<Absol> it reminds me of this clan in gg2
<Absol> everyone hated it
<Absol> and everyone in it was dubm or just in it for shits and giggles
<Absol> it had achievements
<Absol> well
<Absol> "awards"
<Absol> or badges or something like that
<Absol> the clan was army-themed
<Absol> i just noticed the clan topic still exists
<Espeon> o.o
<Absol> last post was in august
*Kyu throws his 3 cents in
*Kyu takes back a penny
<Espeon> Wow Kyu, your post is like, amazing.
<Kyu> 07oops.
<Espeon> IT FEELS LIKE I KINDA WROTE IT IN A LESS TIRED STATE
<Absol> meh i'm rambling
<Espeon> I wouldn't call the place dying, it's more of a case of the regulars being less and less open to new people
<Kyu> 07well
<Espeon> Q
<Espeon> F
<Espeon> T
<Kyu> 07MAYBE I AM YOU.

<Espeon> mysteries
<n2> AND MAYBE I AM KYU
<n2> EXCEPT NOT
<Absol> +=23.16.25=+ <Espeon> I wouldn't call the place dying, it's more of a case of the regulars being less and less open to new people

<n2> lol
<Kyu> 07who?
<SheenaFox> /nick Doctor
*SheenaFox runs
<Ascendant> and Kyu, moving it to community would defeat the purpose of it
<Espeon> ^
<Absol> ah
<Ascendant> It should be a thing everyone can have an opinion on
<Quilava> that and its hard to keep track of people when, you know, they can change their nick AT WILL
<Absol> hehe
<Absol> that's an old change
<Absol> get with the times
<Absol> there's chat now
<Quilava> I know
<Absol> lopl
<Quilava> but the nick changing is annoying
<Quilava> never know who anyone is
<Absol> chat that i don't participate in
<Quilava> same :|
<Absol> aliasing is fun
<Kyu> 07meh
<Kyu> 07I guess

<Light_Latias> ohai BL oxo
<Absol> back in the day
<Black_Latios> 2hiya LL, hiya everyone
<Absol> chat was accomplished through name changes
<Absol> skyrim trailer?
<Kyu> 07but at the same time I don't really like a public post that basically says 'oh this place isn't good anymore'
<Kyu> 07.-.
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya LL and wb ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> DOCTOR WHO ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> *BL
<junh1024-XD> oh\hi LL & BL
<junh1024-XD> & HML
<Absol> also to be honest i have no idea how hard 2.3 is going to affect the players
<Espeon> Well, if people take it that way they obviously haven't read the thread
<Absol> yeah they're working on 2.3 and it's pretty good at the moment
<Absol> but anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya DRF
<Absol> it doesn't include chat and chat isn't going to be updated by vindicator
<Absol> so i wonder
<Absol> how many people are going to quit?
*drf-Droid is getting beaten at L4D2 as usual x.x
<Ascendant> hey drf
<Absol> this is the kind of thing i should be talking about in the gg2 forums
<Absol> berb
<Ascendant> [15:22:40] <Kyu> but at the same time I don't really like a public post that basically says 'oh this place isn't good anymore'
<drf-Droid> and my stupid home connection is lagging like frick
<Ascendant> Also Kyu
<drf-Droid> OK what is going on here
<Ascendant> add the topic to the chat topic please?
<HyperMetalLugia> Well.. quite a lot now

*drf-Droid hides
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Ascendant> http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6744.0
<Ascendant> haha
<drf-Droid> as for the chat not being linked to the site
<drf-Droid> that was my idea
<drf-Droid> because of all the stupid trolls
<HyperMetalLugia> ...
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Quanyails> 7o_o
<Quanyails> 7Really, now?
<drf-Droid> yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Of all people
<Quanyails> 7What trolls?
<Espeon> "all the stupid trolls"
<Espeon> As in plural
<Espeon> what
<HyperMetalLugia> noobs =/= trolls
<drf-Droid> because at that time we had quite a few random mib_guests come on and be stupid
<Soyuz> Absol; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsJO7dmWT8
<Quanyails> 7And you call that trolling?
<Kyu> 07well
<Espeon> being stupid != troll
<drf-Droid> quany
<drf-Droid> you remember that
<Quilava> :/
<drf-Droid> when you went in #brawl to avoid them
<drf-Droid> don't you?
<Kyu> 07I still say that it should go back onto the site
<Quanyails> 7Yes, yes, I remember that.
<Black_Latios> 2i have friends on Whirled who are trollers
<Quanyails> 7But compared to total seclusion?
<Sneas> 03iffikkxgxthg
<Absol> busy
<Sneas> 03rapey
<Absol> typing shit in gg2 about 2.3 update
<drf-Droid> is there seriously anyone on TST that doesn't know that the IRC is irc.lugia.us?
<Espeon> You'd be surprised.
<Quanyails> 7Do they know how IRCs work?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't know
<drf-Droid> ew noobs who can't even type in a simple server >_>
<Kyu> 07but everyone was once at that point
*Quanyails 7points at herself.
<Kyu> 07i.e, nearly everyone here
<Espeon> oh right drf totally knew how irc worked even before knowing what it was. That's totally natural
*Espeon flop
<drf-Droid> I learned from a tutorial
<drf-Droid> using mIRC
<Kyu> 07you're exhibiting the very point of what I posted drf, lol
<drf-Droid> not this one click webchat crap
<drf-Droid> beb
<Espeon> Yeah
<Espeon> you learned
<Espeon> see?
<drf-Droid> *brb
<Espeon> everyone has to learn.
<Black_Latios> 2POPCORN IS DANGEROUS, DO NOT EAT D:
<Espeon> And what Kyu said
<drf-Droid> I learned how to type in the server myself >_>
<HyperMetalLugia> I used mibbit for quite a while XD
<Espeon> I wouldn't call the place dying, it's more of a case of the regulars being less and less open to new people
<drf-Droid> BRB
<Espeon> THAT QUOTED 2TM
<Espeon> erryday
<Kyu> 07lol
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Quilava> so 2.3 will have no chat at all?
<Kyu> 07you're not a rapper D:
<Absol> yeah
<Absol> as far as i know
<Quilava> thats lame
<Absol> because chat is a component of vinmod
<Quanyails> 7Raagh, I'd hate to leave now, but it's close to midnight.
<Kyu> 7also
<Quanyails> 7Au revoir.
<Kyu> 7!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Kyu for 7 minutes
<Absol> and vindicator stopped updating it
<Quanyails> 7Oh, joy.
<HyperMetalLugia> Seeyas Quanny
<Quanyails> 7See ya, ev'ryone.
<Absol> i personally like the fact that chat is going away
<Absol> i say the only useful thing about vinmod is the server features, namely class limits
<Garochi> 12o-O
<Garochi> 12!kyu
*Kyu 7does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.
<Garochi> 12bye Quanyails

<Umbreon> 12:)
*Umbreon snugs

<Sakuya> From the tst inquiry
<Espeon> o.o
<Umbreon> 12she heard of the bad news and talked with her boss and insisted that the food i got be free
<Sakuya> Someone found a giant lugia plush
<Sakuya> For 10 bucks
<Sakuya> Was asking if it was legit
<Sakuya> The description matched
<NightSeas> Why hello Aurora :3
<Sakuya> Thrift stores are amazing

<Soyuz> you usually feel down
<drf-Droid> I'll continue this discussion when I'm back on my computer

<Sakuya> Its not dying, its just different
<Garochi> 12o-o
<junh1024-XD> it's always been changing.
<Espeon> No one caused a panic, and people who say it is dying is a bit negative I'd say. Especially those acting as if it is dead xD
<Kyu> 07it's not really a change in member
<Sakuya> And yeah, people coming and going
<Kyu> 07s
<Kyu> 07I say it's a change in the people who are regulars

<drf|laptop> 03listen to how epic that is
<Cat> no u
<Aristeo> yay me!
<HyperMetalLugia> [East] S Flandre sister last revised devil tried to pitch black and a score
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<nickstr> I found a video a while back featuring an exact cover of the keyboard parts on Light My Fire by the Doors
<SheenaFox> Flandreeeeeeee
<SheenaFox> D:
<nickstr> played on the original instruments
<drf|laptop> 03yeah HML, Google can't translate hte title properly
<drf|laptop> 03I need to ask Sparky what it really says
<Ray> 02Flaaaaandrreeeee ~
<drf|laptop> 03SheenaFox have you heard the epic piano arrangement
<drf|laptop> 03?
<SheenaFox> Yes
<nickstr> a Farfisa Compact Deluxe and a Fender bass
<SheenaFox> I have
<SheenaFox> it's epic
<drf|laptop> 03I know right
<SheenaFox> I need to grow like five arms
<drf|laptop> 03I have the MIDI of it
<drf|laptop> 03and it doesn't even play properly
<drf|laptop> 03in any program
<SheenaFox> LOL
<drf|laptop> 03like it starts lagging
<drf|laptop> 03and skipping
<drf|laptop> 03because of how many notes there are
<drf|laptop> 03it's funny
<SheenaFox> if I had five more arms I could try and play it somehow :'D
<Ascendant> "But seriously, I heard someone make a comment saying that TST isn't the same anymore because "DRF's hosting the new server"... what's wrong with me being the one in charge of Island? Seriously, I don't even get why that's a bad thing. It's not like I'm gonna go around svsnick'ing people and banning people or anything..."
<Ascendant> Someone seriously said that?
<drf|laptop> 03Yeah
<drf|laptop> 03Aurora did
<drf|laptop> 03at one point
<Ascendant> what the <censored>
<drf|laptop> 03she said something about how TST is differnet now because there's no more Nest
<drf|laptop> 03I'm like
<drf|laptop> 03it's just a server
<Ascendant> wat
<drf|laptop> 03what's the big deal
<drf|laptop> 03honestly
<Ascendant> wat
<Ascendant> WAT
<Ascendant> >mfw
<HyperMetalLugia> what
<HyperMetalLugia> LO
<drf|laptop> 03if anything someone who's *actually here* managing 1/2 the server is a good thing
<drf|laptop> 03since Arti would just leave to go on vacation and Nest would die 27.5 times, you know?
<HyperMetalLugia> YOUTUBE is lagging from the song ;P
<Ascendant> yeah Altair XD
<Ascendant> sdjkhasfjkasdf
<Ascendant> kf
<Ascendant> drf*
<Ascendant> wtf
<drf|laptop> 03...LL
<drf|laptop> 03*LOL
<Ascendant> I'm too used to typing Altair
<drf|laptop> 03how did you manage to typo drf as Altair
<Ascendant> since I spam his nick in PM
<drf|laptop> 03I mean what
<Ascendant> about 24/7
<drf|laptop> 03oh o.o
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> he idles like Draelen does
<drf|laptop> 03Altair is actually an engineering company here
<Ascendant> so I spam him
<drf|laptop> 03I applied for a job there
<Ascendant> lmfao
<drf|laptop> 03Altair Engineering
<drf|laptop> 03www.altair.com
<drf|laptop> 03;P
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> hahahaha
<Ascendant> Get altair to work there
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03I'm dead serious though
<drf|laptop> 03their headquarters is like 10 minutes from my house
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> [16:52:40] <drf|laptop> if anything someone who's *actually here* managing 1/2 the server is a good thing
<Ascendant> [16:52:51] <drf|laptop> since Arti would just leave to go on vacation and Nest would die 27.5 times, you know?
<Ascendant> yeah that...it would die
<HyperMetalLugia> I love having this song on 1/2 speed using HTML 5
<Ascendant> Cone dies more than ScriptBot dies
<Chimera|zzz> nini :<
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, if my server dies, it's not like I could actually fix it, but I could at least try to
<junh1024-XD> !scriptbot
<drf|laptop> 03and deloop it if needed
<drf|laptop> 03speaking of which
<drf|laptop> 03I wonder if arti can give me control of the round-robin :/
<HyperMetalLugia> Original text:			
<HyperMetalLugia> 360p < Epic fail
<drf|laptop> 03also hm
<Ascendant> because the scramble scripts cause the client to kaboom
<Ascendant> drf
<drf|laptop> 03junh1024-XD, you made this FLAC slightly too fast XD
<Ascendant> she'd have to give you control of the site then...
<drf|laptop> 03it's supposed to be 220, not 224
<drf|laptop> 03but whtaever
<junh1024-XD> I had to guess a constant BPM.
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03honestly
<Kyu> 07round robin?
<junh1024-XD> but yeah, i was close :>
<drf|laptop> 03I've gotten used to yours being too fast LOL
<drf|laptop> 03Kyu
<drf|laptop> 03the round robin si basically
<Ascendant> rounb robin dNS
<Ascendant> irc.lugia.us
<drf|laptop> 03when someone types irc.lugia.us
<drf|laptop> 03where it directs
<drf|laptop> 03for example
<HyperMetalLugia> nest or ocean
<drf|laptop> 03if ocean is dead
<junh1024-XD> (DNS pool)
<Ascendant> directs to 2 IPs
<drf|laptop> 03and we know it won't be back for a while
<drf|laptop> 03we could just take it off
<drf|laptop> 03so people who type irc.lugia.us would only connect to island
<drf|laptop> 03and vice versa
<drf|laptop> 03and good IRC admins keep control over that
<Ascendant> holy crap
<Ascendant> [16:52:40] <drf|laptop> if anything someone who's *actually here* managing 1/2 the server is a good thing
<drf|laptop> 03I don't even think Articuno ever touched that once after setting it up LOL
<Ascendant> [16:52:51] <drf|laptop> since Arti would just leave to go on vacation and Nest would die 27.5 times, you know?
<Ascendant> dkahdfksd
<Ascendant> sorry
<Ascendant> holy crap
<Ascendant> nightshadow@8133-linux-ns ~ $ nslookup irc.lugia.us

<drf|laptop> 03it's Articuno
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<Ascendant> I can agree with that
<drf|laptop> 03her new job must have gotten the best of her :(
<Ascendant> >:
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes

<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<Light_Latias> I hate not having a comp
<drf|laptop> 03junh1024-XD, what program did you use to make that FLAC?

<drf|laptop> 03I know right
<drf|laptop> 03Starlit too
<drf|laptop> 03though
<drf|laptop> 03at least with her
<drf|laptop> 03sometimes she can be alright
<drf|laptop> 03it's like 50/50 with her
<Ascendant> Starlit is not too bad
<Ascendant> when they're together
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Ascendant> it's horrible
<Ascendant> I swear
<drf|laptop> 03god help us all

<Ascendant> and then Aurora goes like "stop being a jerk"
<drf|laptop> 03hey

<Ascendant> XD
<junh1024-XD> so drf|laptop, i use GB3 to make an AIFF, and Max to FLAC it.
<drf|laptop> 03so you just opened the MIDI in Garage Band and it played it fine?
<junh1024-XD> yep, i made a few settings & instrument changes
<junh1024-XD> i set maximum instruments to 64.
<junh1024-XD> & i changed it from "flute" to "boldt Andre Grand Piano", and volume fixes so it didn't clip.
<Ascendant> "CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES!"
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> that's on your shell's motd drf
<drf|laptop> 03>local authorities
<drf|laptop> 03hm, but it can't be exported back as midi?
<junh1024-XD> through logic express
<Ascendant> <drf|laptop> >local authorities
<junh1024-XD> anyway, you can use any midi seqiencer to combine 16-track to say, 4-track or something, right?
<Ascendant> "I shall report it to the sydney police since they're my local authorities!"
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03I have no idea
<drf|laptop> 03I just take MIDIs and open them
<junh1024-XD> if you do one, note events may overlap and conflict with each other.
<drf|laptop> 03and for editing I just open them
<Ascendant> "They'll do something about some random person in Michigan!"
<drf|laptop> 03I don't do synthesizing stuff
<junh1024-XD> that was what happened with owenp.
<junh1024-XD> owen16 i did not combine tracks.

<nickstr> although given this experiment I could easly change the song from AM Radio to AM Stereo and have it focus on the 1980s rather than the 1970s
<nickstr> gosh I bet the people at Motorola will be upset
<NightSeas> I’ve been really enjoying the new B&W Pokemon episodes
<NightSeas> So much better then the other new episodes
<nickstr> EWW B&W
<NightSeas> lol
<NightSeas> I do understand why some don’t like it
<NightSeas> Though I love it
<nickstr> at least you are not trying to force other people to watch it
<NightSeas> Yeah XD

<eXAKR> I wonder if I should have a sound for Menu Command though
<eXAKR> a.k.a. make a sound when you click on a menu command
<eXAKR> I used the sound when you click on a menu item in Pokémon BW
<eXAKR> But it seems to get anniying fast

<Armageddon> I am slightly fuming
<Ascendant> The spam that I protested against and of which caused my ban in the first place
<NightSeas> Oh
<Ascendant> I admit I was wrong in the way that I did protest
<NightSeas> I see
<Ascendant> But I still haven't let go of the fact that they SHOULDN'T have spammed the crap out of the main channel
<Ascendant> They can have fun, but no one else does
<NightSeas> I don't see why they don't go to #ircgames |D
<NightSeas> Instead of spaming Silverwing
<NightSeas> Silverwings#
<NightSeas> *
<NightSeas> Erm, typo mess
<NightSeas> *#Silverwings
<Ascendant> #ircgames didn't exist back then
<Ascendant> but the point still stands
<NightSeas> Oh
<Ascendant> they can join another channel to do crap
<Ascendant> no one gives a crap about their "fun"
<NightSeas> lol, yeah
<Ascendant> and yeah, I'll stop venting now
<Ascendant> I still hold a grudge against that event I guess

<Aizen> ARMAGEDDON
<Armageddon> from Aurora
<Armageddon> "My reasons for seeing the difference are very similar to what Kyu said. I can take several examples, should we go back to the bleurugherhgh event? There are a couple people in chat who find it necessary to crush most of that randomness into the dirt. A lot of us actually have fun with that. Half the reason arti split away is because of that I'm sure. I personally miss seeing her in there everyday, and it eventually turning into a swdgknj
<Armageddon> drgekrdg fit for a few minutes. TST was fun back then. Take a look at the old peas for example. Half of the really funny ones, the ones you can TELL people are having fun, were from stupid stuff like that. It's so much more serious now, to the point I really just hate being there. It's one thing to get irritated for one person posting nonsense stuff on their own (granted, I've done this, I know I have, and I stop when people ask me to)...
<Armageddon> .but when like 5 of us are having fun, yeah."
<Armageddon> the blergrgrh shit

<Ascendant> I just realised
<Ascendant> that Articuno doesn't have herself as an admin anymore...
<Ascendant> she's only in technicians...
<jasperbot> mmm cat
<lightumbreon> wow, so that list shows who work on the site, am i right?
<Ascendant> it's the staff page
<Ascendant> just like any other staff page
<Ascendant> so yes
<Ascendant> it does
<lightumbreon> that is sooo many!
<Ascendant> Lol.
<lightumbreon> i'm the only on who is working on my dad his site, with my dad of course
<lightumbreon> like being the only admin is boring
<Ascendant> lol
<lightumbreon> but it's fun to do
<lightumbreon> right?
<Ascendant> depends on what you need to do
<Ascendant> if you need to deal with annoying retards then no, it's not fun
<Ascendant> otherwise it's usually okay
<lightumbreon> uhmm, it's not like a forum, but as a site for my dad's company
<lightumbreon> thats way diffirent and harder than a (simple) forum site
<Ascendant> >assuming that I'm an idiot
<Ascendant> I know what you mean
<Ascendant> I was kidding before and being sarcastic but that's not hard
<lightumbreon> not if you do that for a longer time
<Ascendant> considering that I enjoy helping others and programming I don't mind it
<Ascendant> lol
<lightumbreon> meh, i'm still learning how to program
<lightumbreon> next year, i have ITTL as subject on school, thats where the Theoretical ICT kicks ini
<Ascendant> ITTL?
<lightumbreon> yea, a special ICT subject for the Theoratical learning way
<lightumbreon> but thats how we call it over here, alot of differences
<lightumbreon> but it all comes down on the same thing anyway

<lightumbreon> yup
<Quanyails> 7I was reminded about mymapagainstyourcash's remixes.
<lightumbreon> ah,
<lightumbreon> my recommendation for TF2 remixes go out after DWL1993
<lightumbreon> in fact, i'm listening to it now
<Quanyails> 7Sounds pretty good.
<Quanyails> 7I also have a strange preference to 'Erectin' a River'. O.o
<lightumbreon> yea, that one from wazgul, eh?
<lightumbreon> it's pretty good
<Quanyails> 7It's just sorta loony but cool at the same time. :P

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Things are a bit different, like how the kid who's on you*hope this isn't spoilers* has a life bar when he gets off, and you control him more, like with Issun.
<Jason> Hi Aristeo!
<Aurora> 6yeah I knew that lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Otherwise it was general stuff, how to bloom, power slash, and fight monsters
<Aurora> 6but hmm
<Aristeo> ^^
<Jason> e.e.e whats new?
<Quanyails> 7'we just find it annoying and he finds it annoying that we get annoyed at him being annoying -v-' <-- Well.
<Jason> e.e.**
<Aristeo> just being sleepy
*Skylands enjoyed Arti's post </sarcasm>
<The_Luginator> Whaa
<The_Luginator> Weird line
<Skylands> 10Now I feel worse than ever before on what I did
<Jason> ah
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Jason> well you did wake up at like 9 a,
<Jason> am*
<The_Luginator> Oh joy..
*The_Luginator wonders if.. nah
<Aristeo> mhm
*Skylands debates on whether or not to post
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I probably won't post
<Quanyails> 7If you think it'd help or hinder this dilemma.
<Skylands> 10I was gonna say if Arti doesn't want to work alongside be, then be so
<Skylands> 10I don't work on this chat anyways, I never did
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I fear that if I say anything, I'll get ridiculed
<Skylands> 10I'm a forum mod for god's sake
<Skylands> 10Why she avoids here, who knows
<Skylands> 10I idle most of the time
<Quanyails> 7We're all tense about each other's opinions, are we?
*Skylands planned on saying something along those lines in her post
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No, I have that fear when I post anything on any forum thread
<Jason> soooooo
<Espeon> No need to. If someone ridicules you, they are totaly idiots in this case.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes, maybe in this case
<Quanyails> 7We're not gonna get off this case unanimously, it seems.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But heck, what would I say?
<Quanyails> 7Well, you're a member of the community.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Really?
<Quanyails> 7Would you isolate yourself?
<Aurora> 6this whole thing is ablah
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Already done for me it feels, lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Sheena
<SheenaFox> hi Shiny
<Aristeo> :3
<Quanyails> 7Well, there's the problem.
<Quanyails> 7@ Shiny.
<SheenaFox> What, me? D:
<Quanyails> 7No, Sheena. :P
<SheenaFox> Okay XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hmm?
<Quanyails> 7I had a feeling you'd say something about that.
<Quanyails> 7So you feel you've been isolated by the... chat? Community?
<Aurora> 6I don't even know why i'm posting
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Most likely both?
<Aurora> 6whatever though
*Aristeo sits next to Jason
<Quanyails> 7What's keeping you here?
*Skylands posted :/
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Two people, won't say their names though
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Quanyails> 7Not the entire scope of this community, eh?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Nope
*Jason hugs Aristeo
<Quanyails> 7Ah, the question I'd like to ask next would be rather... harsh, to an extent.
<Espeon> NEGATIVITY OVERLOAD UPRISING
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Aurora> 6lol
<Aristeo> You should play Allods Online with me
<Quanyails> 7I dunno about that, Espy.
<Espeon> And everyone's "harsh" by normal standards right now. It's what's needed right now.
<Aristeo> It's free :3
<Aurora> 6read that as overlord
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<Skylands> 10Tbh Espeon, I expected as much
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That's fine then
<Espeon> People have to say what they mean
<Jason> hmm
<Jason> linux too?
<Quanyails> 7Okay, so the question, then:
<Aurora> 6up until now, a lot of people have restricted their opnions
<Aurora> 6now it's unbarred, everyone for themselves
<Jason> is it java based?
<Aurora> 6which, tbh, is yeah needed
<Jason> or flash based?
<Aristeo> No :( I had to dual boot Windows
<Quanyails> 7Would you leave TST?
<Skylands> 10@ who?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Me
<Jason> well, my comp cant even handle flash
<Quanyails> 7Shiny.
<Jason> so, i think ill stick to not playing it
<Jason> ;)
<Jason> otherwise, you know i would
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'd say I already mainly seperated myself from the forums, I come back now and then, mainly to force myself to be active again.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Would I leave TST? No, I had too many good memories to leave
<Aurora> 6Articuno, Aurora, Quanyails, Skylands, Xelig00n, Arceus (Safir-Hime), Shiny-Ho-Oh, SheenaFox, Nickario, HyperMetalLugia and 2 Guests are viewing this topic.
<Aurora> 6wow guys
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh I'm still on the topic lol
<Quanyails> 7I've kept a window open for it since it started.
<Quanyails> 7But anywhoo: well, I've quit cold turkey at other sites where I've felt I had to force myself to get on--not TST yet, but yeah.
<Quanyails> 7It's rather alleviating.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I've done that to many sites, now and then I'll get back on just to see what's happening, but I don't care anymore
<Aristeo> It's a fun game! It's like what WoW would be if WoW was actually fun to play and didn't have trolls
<SheenaFox> eh wait
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<SheenaFox> oh
<Quanyails> 7Well, I can't really correlate to that extent.
<Aurora> 6sheena yeah you've missed a bunch lol
<Aristeo> It's like what would happen if Oblivion and Pixie Hollow were merged together
<Aurora> 6I'll talk to you in other channel
<SheenaFox> No I know about the topic
<SheenaFox> but I was wnderong why i was nick laerter
<Aurora> 6oh
<Aurora> 6laerter lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Good going Roara your teasing chased her off
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7I'm assuming we're lightening this mood?
<The_Luginator> i guess
<Aurora> 6lol
<Aurora> 6she had to go
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Just my nature to do so
<Aurora> 6but she left before I asked where she was going
<Aurora> 6it's a bbl
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh is that your excuse :U
*Quilava squeaks
<Aurora> 6yes

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm still reading this topic
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yet it feels like everything is encoded and I have no clue what's going on
<Quanyails> 7Well, that's not too enigmatic.
<Skylands> 10Probably what most forum-goers are thinking @ Shiny
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I just hate being clueless tbh lol
<The_Luginator> Secrets.. kinda
*lightumbreon|reception comes back with ringing ears

*Quanyails 7read that as lightumbreon|inception

*Soyuz burns the growlithes fluff o3o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I actually read ahead of the assignments lolol
<Aurora> 6you read it for your CLASS?
<Aurora> 6I wish my class was that awesome
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Aye
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It was...English 9
<Aurora> 6LUCKY LOL
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02For years I could practically recite the whole poem
<Marik> MARIK VERSUS REX RAPTOR
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<Marik> 8000 | 8000
<Quanyails> 7Dyah.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And then one year I was watching some super hero show, and the bad guy was reciting the poem in his own way. I found that mildly creepy, yet super funny
<Aurora> 6lol
<Cat> :(
<Aurora> 6the ending totally...I wasn't expecting it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You cannot burn mah floof
<Aurora> 6I mean, suspicions
<Aurora> 6but yeh
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I wasn't either
<Aurora> 6I was like asdwaefsbjkekgr when I read it
<Aurora> 6my stepmom looked at me like i was stupid
<Espeon> it's firefloof
<Soyuz> But I just did with Dragon fire D:
<Aurora> 6cuz I was so quiet all day
<Soyuz> pff
<Soyuz> firefloof
<Aurora> 6until then
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Our teacher ripped out the last page of the book telling us who the killer was
*Damos huggles the Growlithe
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So I was probably put on suspence for about 2 weeks(even though it was easy to figure out who it was without the last page)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02<3
<Soyuz> But there can only be one
<Soyuz> and there's 3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No, there's always more than one
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And wtf
<Soyuz> Now there's 2
<Aurora> 6yeah I knew it on the second page of that letter
<Marik> 8500 | 7200
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm not on the bouncer, so I have no idea why my other one keeps coming up
<Marik> before i even attack
<Soyuz> Shiny-Growlithe; maybe you are the growilithe bouncer?
<Soyuz> and then Espeon is the floof pimp XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But even if we knew we couldn't say to those who didn't or we'd be docked a letter grade. Which was fine, people don't want spoilers, but I remember talking to my friend and we were trying to figure out who would die
<Espeon> LOLwut
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And who was the killer, and some girl listens halfway in and thought that we totally spoiled the ending for her, so we got told on.
*Shiny-Growlithe sprawls out on Espeon
<Aurora> 6lol
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Aurora> 6I loved that book
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Good book, wanted to read more books like that
<Aurora> 6I bought it, admittedly, because "There Will Be None" is the name of a spell card in touhou
<Aurora> 6yes, based on that book
<Aurora> 6plus, the song is named U.N. Owen Was Her?
*Espeon is an Espeon bed or something.
<Aurora> 6so yeah

<Aurora> 6the fixing part
<Aurora> 6realized that probably sounded like we were talking about something else
<Skylands> 10and I'm not seeing any fixing yet
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It can be hard to fix a problem
<Aurora> 6mainly because she's gone and i don't have the patience here anymore
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That you have no idea how to fix
<Aurora> 6and you're basically-
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Aurora> 6you sound liek you're blaming me for it
<Aurora> 6like I'M the one who's supposed to fix it
<Skylands> 10No
*PandaFlower tosses where somewhere :p
<PandaFlower> hi where
<Espeon> Firstly, no one has been flaming anyone.
<Aurora> 6^
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I believe it's the community's job, not just to rely on the mods/admins when things go bad
<Espeon> And secondly, yay for going back to the actual topic.
<Aurora> 6comments directed at certain people were actually informative
*Aristeo catches him <3
<Espeon> And thirdly, Shiny everything you've said has been right today c:
<Aurora> 6dunno how to describe that without it sounding like we're supposed to enjoy this

<Espeon> And :3 indeed
*where waits for Cat to be perfectly cooked
<Aurora> 6lol
<Skylands> 10I used "flame" for the lack of better word at the time
<Espeon> And I'm only talking about the parts of it that I know anything about btw <<
*Skylands can't think straight right now
<Espeon> My knowledge is limited on certain things and I'll just refrain from commenting on them.
<PandaFlower> the pms didn't work so i called him
*Damos huggles Sky
<Aurora> 6the way I see it, everyone's going to have to take part in it
<Espeon> Well obviously
<Espeon> it's a community "challenge" if anything
<Aurora> 6I care enough about this place that I don't want to leave with it on a negative side, I'd like to see it have something build off of before leaving
<Aurora> 6otherwise, I would have been gone yesterday
<PandaFlower> i wanna make a tree that beats stuff up
<DeadCrab> back
<DeadCrab> i got distracted by tom and jerry

<Angel_Espeon> 13buuut that's a very vague description |D
<HyperMetalLugia> Niice
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Espeon> So, is Persona 3 where they shoot themselves with those "Invoker" things?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02What sistem is it for?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Nvm
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02do not answer lol
<Espeon> Probably PSdouble.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02system*
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02PS2
<Angel_Espeon> 13Evokers, and yes they do "shoot" themselves xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I personally think it's awesome
<Espeon> Ah okay LOL. Then I've heard of it xD

<Angel_Espeon> 13Can't remember if I've linked that before or not, but yeah |D
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02hi
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll either call that cutscene either amazingly awesome and epic, or as downright freaky as the entire movie of Princess Mononoke
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL, I've yet to see that movie
<Aurora> 6awesome movie, it is
<Aurora> 6this movie you linked....wow
<Aurora> 6what did i just watch LOL
<Aurora> 6curiously awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes <3
<HyperMetalLugia> You just watched awesomeness
<Soyuz> growlithe fwiendship
<HyperMetalLugia> And as much as I don't really like animeish videos
<HyperMetalLugia> I though it was epicellent!
<HyperMetalLugia> OOh
<HyperMetalLugia> It's on the PS2 :D
<Growlithe> Yes
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah, hence why the game was practically impossible to find in shops, along with Persona 4 xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yay for ebay~
<Aurora> 6so wait
<Aurora> 6these people shoot themselves
<Aurora> 6and it summons that....what is that
<HyperMetalLugia> And... they die..
<HyperMetalLugia> A monster o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> AE, explain nao
<Angel_Espeon> 13They don't literally shoot themselves, it's not an actual gun :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13and what he summoned was a persona
<Angel_Espeon> 13the evokers are needed to bring out the persona that's inside them
<Aurora> 6ah
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6making sense
<Aurora> 6thats awesome
<Aurora> 6:>
*Quilava weegles
<Angel_Espeon> 13The minute I started playing, I could instantly tell it was so much darker than Persona 4 xD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02My Growlithe
<Angel_Espeon> 13made me feel all tense even though not much was happening in the opening cutscene
<Angel_Espeon> 13well, until the second half at least :B
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Maybe I can find a LP of it
<Garochi> 12breadsticks!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02but it looks like an RPG, which gets boring
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Cheeseon!
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's an RPG, but the game focuses heavily on storyline and plot :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I love those games
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But there also has to be good gameplay or I'll get gamerage before I even make it to the next plot point
*Sneas may as well leave
<Garochi> 12yep
<NightSeas> Hia Bree ^^
<Garochi> 12how goes

<Aurora> 6I trust those words oddly enough
<NightSeas> Same

<Aurora> 6wth
<Skylands> 10Even with invisible mode
<Skylands> 10She isn't on
<Kyu> 07in fact I was coming up with a post
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah
<Skylands> 10Well, unlocked it anyway
<Feather> 10Mods can't see invisibles anymore lol
<Skylands> 10We can see when they're viewing the topic
<Aurora> 6well, she's not on, I don't see her
<Skylands> 10It will show up as +1 hidden
<Feather> 10oh
<Feather> 10right
<Skylands> 10Good post, Xeli
<Espeon> .
<Skylands> 10hm?
<Espeon> Nothing, just :3
<Aurora> 6yeah good things reminding me of the competition
<Aurora> 6it's kinda been on hold
<Aurora> 6for obvious reasons
<Aurora> 6but yes, we were trying to get the next one started
<Espeon> I see o.o. What kind of competition? And great point in the post too - it's not "everyone else", it's "all of us" =P
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6it's a suprise lololol
<Aurora> 6but yeah, I'll prod articuno so we can finish it
<Espeon> i see¨
<Skylands> 10Suprises are fun
<Aurora> 6our main problem is the prizes
<Aurora> 6we haven't decided on it yet
<Skylands> 10Free art?
<Aurora> 6that's the thing
<Skylands> 10if you're not keen on spending money
<Aurora> 6I told her it was a possibility, but she doesn't feel up to it anymore, and i really REALLY don't have the time for that
<Aurora> 6but at the same time
<Aurora> 6if we can't think of anything else
<Aurora> 6that will be a fallback plan
<Aurora> 6dunno who would be putting art in for prizes though
<Skylands> 10I was thinking of you, but after what you just said, lol
<Skylands> 10Unless someone on TST wants to offer
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah...
<Aurora> 6I would but I also don't feel like I'm good enough for that lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Pssh
<Feather> 10eh, I might be up for it, but I don't feel I'm good enough :/
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02PsshX2
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You two are both great :U
<Aurora> 6if we can time it right, I'd be able to do something for a prize, but for the next two weeks I'm not doing anything prize related lol
<Skylands> 10Yeah
<Skylands> 10Give more credit to yourselves
<Aurora> 6BFOI has that spot
<Aurora> 6considering I've wasted a ton of time lol >.>

<Espeon> I'm curious now.
<Icydragon> Don't we all?
*Shiny-Growlithe is too lol
<SpyroD> I beat the original 100% and now there is nothing to do but play the portable one I have almost completed
<Quanyails> 7?
<Nintendofreak> th enew one looks meh...
<Nintendofreak> but i'll wait and see how it turns out
<SpyroD> I only have the old versions, but I heve only rented the dawn of the dragon game
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Curious
<SpyroD> and beat it too, almost 100%
<Armageddon> Ah
<Armageddon> that's weird
<SpyroD> 95% or so
<Ascendant> Don't worry about it
<Ascendant> I'm probably just raging for no reason
<Ascendant> like I usually do
<Espeon> Well you're not one to get mad about opinions and such that's why I went like

<SpyroD> Y?, dragon fly was fine when I played it, a bit short though
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.

<NightSeas_Away> Heyz Quanyails :3

<Quanyails> 7Gah, I've gotta go. D:

<Drake> 04Ok, cya Quan
<SpyroD> hay, are you by chance on the dark spyro forums?
<Ascendant> Xeli
<Ascendant> there's an exception to that lol
<Ascendant> You know I stand up for my friends no matter the situation
<SpyroD> nintendofreak?
<Ascendant> some of the things that have been said about my friends is just damn unfair
<Espeon> Well everyone is just being honest in that thread, and honesty is something that is often unfair.
<SpyroD> 8% downloaded
<Espeon> And I know you mean it well, in your very own way=P
<SpyroD> its taking forever
<Armageddon> nothing much, you?
<Ascendant> xD
<Icydragon> hmh
<Ascendant> Yeah I know that
<Ascendant> It's good that everyone is being honest here
<Ascendant> Because that's something that has begun to lack recently...
<Ascendant> for me at least
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02brb food
<Ascendant> not talking about here

*Armageddon hugs Quil
<Espeon> I try my best to avoid being one but
<SpyroD> 9%
<Espeon> it often fails
<Espeon> sometimes
<Espeon> anyway
<Espeon> whatever
<SpyroD> its going to suck if this is a fake
<Espeon> And the new official best thing ever is seeing two lagswitchers trying to shoot eachother in a game.
<SpyroD> brb geting icecream
<Nintendofreak> afk playing mkw online
<Ascendant> ._.
<Espeon> I like the part where one of them flipped for too long and disconnected.
*Espeon hugs :3
<Ascendant> lmfao
*Ascendant hugs back
<Ascendant> LOL Xeli
<Espeon> I'm so easily amused when tired
<Angel_Espeon> 13This is such a late response, but it seems my comp is too much of a fail to play Animator vs Animation 3 :|
<Espeon> it's not even funny
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> it's okay
<Ascendant> but hi Angel_Espeon
<Ascendant> and really? It's just a flash animation
<Espeon> Wow you've always said it's afail but wow xD
<Espeon> And HIiii :3
<Ascendant> use like, adobe flash player although adobe's crap eats up a lot of resources
<Ascendant> :D
<Espeon> adobe LOVES some RAM
<Espeon> it must be related to firefox
*Quilava squeaks and sighs
<Angel_Espeon> 13my computer and adobe don't get along :B
<NightSeas> Adobe eats ram for breakfast
<Espeon> as we're talking firefox hogs 756 MB of my RAM. On my old laptop that would actually be a problem.
<Espeon> But then again, YOUTUBE TABS EVERYWHERE
<NightSeas> Adobe eats Disk Space for dinner XD
<Espeon> It also eats money, or it wants to do so.
<Espeon> c:
<SpyroD> wats that?
<Angel_Espeon> 13My comp has the minimum amount of RAM to run on
<Angel_Espeon> 13and it's too old to buy moar
<Angel_Espeon> 13Something tells me I need a new computer
<NightSeas> Adobe Ai Price: $699 I think
<Angel_Espeon> 13But that costs moneyyy
<Espeon> Wouldn't hurt =P. And if you first get a new one,get one that will last a while xD
<Ascendant> [10:57:56] <Espeon> adobe LOVES some RAM
<Ascendant> [10:58:00] * Aeroslash (Aeroslash@168-103-62-172.dlth.qwest.net) has quit (Quit: bbl *poofs*)
<Ascendant> [10:58:03] <Espeon> it must be related to firefox
<Ascendant> XD
<Espeon> the more expensive something s the more amusing it is to find the serial keys through a simple google search
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well this one's lasted for over 10 years, so |D
<Espeon> Wow
<Ascendant> Altair's old server was a 10 year old computer
<Espeon> That's quite old in COMPUTER land.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02baack
<Espeon> Wbizzle
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02tyizzle
<Altair> Heh
<NightSeas> Of course, I see why Adobe eats up ram
<Altair> I slapped a new LAN card in that thing and I now use it as a stereo :)
<Espeon> xD
<Altair> shoutcast box ftw
<Angel_Espeon> 13Hasn't bothered me too much though, so long as it runs Touhou, Youtube and basic programs fine then I'm happy
<Angel_Espeon> 13though it IS slow as hell
<NightSeas> Adobe works like magic
<Angel_Espeon> 13but I'm used to it |D
<Altair> What OS are you running?
<Altair> Windows on a old box = loss of hair
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02NSSS
<Angel_Espeon> 13XP
<Nintendofreak> mario kart wii
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02NSSS
<Altair> Lol, thats what I ran
<Armageddon> ;o
<Espeon> If she said Vista I would
<n2> [07:00:47] <Altair> Windows on a old box = loss of hair <-only if you dont know how to use it
<Espeon> probably curl up and cry in horror
*Shiny-Growlithe needs to PM youuu
<Altair> Windows on ANY box = loss of hair
<Altair> :P
<n2> why?
<Espeon> I still have hair.
<Ascendant> <Altair> Windows on ANY box = loss of hair
<Ascendant> qft
<HyperMetalLugia> Lies
<n2> nonono, let altair speak
<Espeon> Until the day it actually starts annoying me I see no reason to switch xD
<Armageddon> you don't need to ask xD
<Espeon> inb4 pros/cons everywhere erryday
<HyperMetalLugia> Saame Espeon
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I wasn't asking
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 7 minutes

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I was informing that I was PMing you, like it or not
<HyperMetalLugia> OH MAIZ WindOWZ SuckzORs CauSe TEh SLoWZ

*Shiny-Growlithe curls up under Xeli
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yo Altair
<Altair> Linux is a better OS, but good luck playing games
<n2> no, good luck DOING anything
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha XD
<Altair> You don't need luck if you know what you are doing.
<HyperMetalLugia> n2 finally wins my respect
<n2> linux is made by supernerds for other supernerds
<Espeon> As I see it
<HyperMetalLugia> Who hate other people who aren't
<Espeon> nearly every OS has its use
<Armageddon> ah
<Ascendant> <Altair> Linux is a better OS, but good luck playing games
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02SO YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT
<n2> i run linux on anything that has a specific purpose
<Ascendant> not like I play games that much
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because I ate or not
<Espeon> and just like VIDYA GAMING PLATFORMS - pick the one you like and simply leave others alone to do the same
<Espeon> :3
<HyperMetalLugia> I only use linux for HDD purposes
<Altair> I dislike Windows because with each release, it gets more bloated
<Ascendant> this comp can't run Assassin's Creed ;-;;
<Ascendant> yeah Altair
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL bloated XD
<Ascendant> any windows release is bloated
<n2> for example, my dns, time server and router run linux
<legend_knight_234> yo
<legend_knight_234> nintendo
<Ascendant> oh dns
<Ascendant> Altair
<n2> so is my webserver
<Ascendant> you need to fix bind9
<Altair> yeah i know
<Espeon> itc opinions presented as facts
<n2> you talk about windows being bloated and you run bind?
<n2> -.0
<n2> *-.-
<Espeon> o.o
<Altair> hell, my server runs 2003
<Armageddon> o-o
<Altair> Yes

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02~
*n2 bangs head on wall
<SpyroD> sry, im abit bussy, so mario kart, fun game
<n2> i hate server03
<Armageddon> heya Damos
<Espeon> ~ is all-powerful.
<Ascendant> it works
<HyperMetalLugia> Windows 7 is less bloated than Vista which is more bloated than XP which is more bloated than 98/2000 which is more bloated than the DOS/3.1 < Cause of new features?
<Altair> It serves its purpose
<n2> *not
<legend_knight_234> your both here that's good
<Ascendant> and at least I can kill Altair's comp
<Ascendant> when I want to
<n2> vmware hated server03 when i ran it
<Ascendant> heya Sheena
<SpyroD> k
<Ascendant> vmware hates everything
<NightSeas> WB Sheena :3
<SheenaFox> hi Ascendant
<n2> vmware likes windows XP?

<HyperMetalLugia> Comfy chairs
<SheenaFox> XD
<Ascendant> xD
<Espeon> o-o
<Ascendant> ;o
<SheenaFox> ;D
<Altair> I have no reason to use anything else
<Altair> I installed it to test it out and I left it on there
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Altair> It does fine for what I use it for
<n2> you cant say that if you do nothing with it :<
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm pretty much the tidiest person in the house
<Angel_Espeon> 13the only reason my room is so cramped and untidy is because my mum dumped stuff into my room that she doesn't want anymore >:/
<Espeon> I'm right on the middle when it comes to tidiness lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13such as a lovely big set of drawers right in front of the door
<Andres> Hi, Kitten <3
<jasperbot> k
*Shiny-Growlithe is random when it comes to tidiness
<Kitten> hi
<Angel_Espeon> 13which I still walk into sometimes when I'm not paying attention
<Altair> i could use regular XP for the server
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I usually don't care one way or another
<n2> why dont you?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And then suddenly I'll be like "I need to clean up my shtuff"
<Altair> because i cba to switch
<Altair> :P
<Damos> 13hey Army
<n2> and that is the first real answer you gave
<Angel_Espeon> 13People tell me I have mild OCD because I go insane if my room isn't tidy
<Angel_Espeon> 13they're all "you're a teenager, your room's supposed to be messy"
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<Espeon> I used to be like
<Altair> why should i switch?
<Espeon> I knew where everything was as long as it was untidy :3
<Espeon> Now I'm the other way around
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll be honest, my wardrobe is pretty untidy
<Angel_Espeon> 13but I cba tidying that because it's always closed so no one sees it xD
<HyperMetalLugia> rectangle > any os
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Exactly Xeli XD
<Armageddon> .-.
<SheenaFox> I keep most of my room clean
<SheenaFox> except my bed
<Angel_Espeon> 13and yes, my wardrobe is the exception where it's untidy but I know exactly where all my clothes are
<Armageddon> I'm so happy I don't have that to highlight me
<Armageddon> T_T
<Angel_Espeon> 13Organised mess FTW
<SheenaFox> My bed only gets made on the weekends XD
<n2> 3OS info: StarFOX on WinXP Professional 5.1 Service Pack 2 (Build #2600)

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I remembered seeing something that reminded me of NS
<Ascendant> <Altair> why should i switch?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02what was it now...
<Ascendant> it'd also take the server down
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh yeah! The end of the world
<Ascendant> for like, an hour or so
<SpyroD> hello?
<n2> an hour?
<Ascendant> while you wait for XP to install
<Ascendant> :{D
<Altair> thats not a huge deal
<Ascendant> yes it is
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not only do I make my own bed every day, I'll also make anyone else's bed if I see a bed that hasn't been made yet
<n2> more like 6 hours :<
<Angel_Espeon> 13it makes the entire room look untidy IMO D:
<Ascendant> oh yeah 6 hours
<Ascendant> xD
<Armageddon> XD
<n2> you install XP, then you have to install everything else
<Espeon> That IS kinda ocd'ish lol :3
<NightSeas> <Angel_Espeon> People tell me I have mild OCD because I go insane if my room isn't tidy <-- Omg I feel the same way XD
<NightSeas> <Angel_Espeon> they're all "you're a teenager, your room's supposed to be messy"

<Ascendant> yeah
<Garochi> 12the guy banned me from his own channel on another server
<Ascendant> <Garochi> the guy banned me from his own channel on another server
<Ascendant> wat
<Garochi> 12because i wouldn't modify a script that was only active here
<Espeon> Wasn't it because you
<Ascendant> .
<Ascendant> seriously?
<Garochi> 12yes
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I mean, some people's views I understand, but I never figured out Kipi's reason
<Suicune> damos is cute.
<Ascendant> your !umbreon script or something?
<Espeon> didn't make !umbreon reply you belonged to him permanently or something?
<Garochi> 12yes
<Espeon> Lol
<Ascendant> .
<Ascendant> lol
<Espeon> Because internet is obviously serious business.
<Ascendant> XD
<Garochi> 12i swear he had it in for me for some reason
<Ascendant> Shiny
<Ascendant> I agree with you
<Garochi> 12i was so glad when he left
<Ascendant> probably because some people here hated on us and then he made his decision based on that
<Ascendant> but meh, I dunno
<Ascendant> well I don't think I was there when he left
<Garochi> 12wanted to make a holiday out of it
<Ascendant> but I saw his DA
<Espeon> Lol
<Ascendant> and went wtf at his comments on HoR
<Espeon> It seems like he doesn't have a reason really.

<Ray> 02:D?
<eXAKR> Like?
<Creideiki> And by "pretty retro" I mean "not even remotely retro."
<Creideiki> Three impact printers.
<eXAKR> OK
<SpyroD> 6to who?
<Creideiki> From the early 80s.
<Neon> Anyone.
<eXAKR> e-Machines computers?
<SpyroD> 6yes icy
*eXAKR hides
<Neon> Prince-dari, perhaps.
<SpyroD> 6he hasnt said anything
<Neon> Irrelevant. :P
<Icydragon> 12Wait.......... what?
<Creideiki> New LexMark Z-Series printer, 12" color composite Apple display and that's it.
<eXAKR> oo
<Creideiki> Of the impact printers, the most "standard" one is probably the most retro.
<Quanyails> 7Bayes's theorem. :|
<Quanyails> 7It's confusing me.
<Creideiki> As it's for 15" wide paper, 9 pin dot matrix.
<SpyroD> 6we were fine till you showed up "neon"
<Lightning> although we can rp here its technically against the rules and a seperate chat was made for roleplaying
<Neon> Dari's not responding, and it seems like Icy's involved in this, so I won't interrupt.
<Neon> Perhaps I want to be technical.
<Creideiki> And for eMachines stuff... I advise the Vintage Computer Forums... lots of people, lots of stuff.
<Creideiki> Some actually selling their stuff. :P
<Lightning> you can't get on it though if you signed using spyrochat.com
<eXAKR> I could rather have an IBM Model M
<eXAKR> Compact sized, with no numpad
<SpyroD> 6Im on spyrochat
<eXAKR> Then I could spraypaint the sides glossy black
<Blackwing> o_O

<Lightning> not the rp channel though

<Sparky> it's something about Flandre
<drf|laptop> 03ignore the actual videeo, they just uploaded it from nicovideo with no description
<drf|laptop> 03well obviously
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Sparky> XD
<drf|laptop> 03google translates it as something dumb
<SpyroD> 6????
<Sparky> shoot
<drf|laptop> 03like "S. Flandre's theme that black people are unable to play"
<drf|laptop> 03I was like LOL BLACK PEOPLE
<drf|laptop> 03so obviously that's wrong
<Icydragon> 12<3
<SheenaFox> wtf lol
<drf|laptop> 03but what exactly does it say?
<Sparky> … AHAHAHA
<Neon> HEART POWER
<drf|laptop> 03I'm dead serious, copy that text into Google translate

<Icydragon> 12God I hated that show...
<where> did you two coordinate that joke?
<SpyroD> 6understood
<Umbreon> 12Quilava it's not that hard
<Umbreon> 12hiscores start at top 2,000,000
<SpyroD> 6neverheard of it
<Sparky> lol
<Sparky> the "east" is Touhou
<Quilava> that's a lot more than I'd ever want to earn
<Umbreon> 12usually you can get top 2,000,000 at the 30-40 range
<Icydragon> 12How old are you?
<Quilava> oh
<Quilava> top 2 mil
<SpyroD> 6who?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Umbreon> 12except the common stats
<drf|laptop> 03OK so what's that title mean?
<Umbreon> 12like strength attack and defense
<Umbreon> 12you usually have to get it really high up there to hit hiscores
<Icydragon> 12you
<SpyroD> 6Y?
<Icydragon> 12*evil laugh*
<SpyroD> 6information withheld
<drf|laptop> 03anyway Sparky

<drf|laptop> 03translate the description
<Icydragon> 12DUN DUN DUUUUUN
*Kyro is listening to Thousand Sunds
<Kyro> Suns*
<Skylands> 10Linkin Park?
<SpyroD> 6k?, whats that got to do with me?
<Umbreon> 12sunds lol
<Sparky> "【Touhou】 [I] made Final fiend sister Flandre•S's sheet-music pitch-black revised version"
<Skylands> 10Their new album = crap
<Sparky> the I isn't actually in there
<Icydragon> 12I like em young
<Sparky> but it's implied
<Skylands> 10The only song I did like somewhat was The Catalyst
<Nova> whats their new album called?
<Kyro> Thousand Suns
*Skylands wants LP to go back to the Hybrid Theory/Meteora style
<Neon> Old enough to count, old enough to mount.
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<junh1024-XD> Flandre's theme?
<drf|laptop> 03so basically they're saying it's a refised sheet music version?
<Icydragon> 12;3
<drf|laptop> 03*Revised
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, that makes sense
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Kyro> Catalyst, Burning in the Skies, and Reqiuem are my favorites
<Sparky> dunno
<drf|laptop> 03UN Owen Was Her is another name for Flandre's Theme
<Kyro> agreed ^
<drf|laptop> 03apparently
<junh1024-XD> &DRF, ne more questions about owen16.m4a?
<drf|laptop> 03I don't play the games
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Sparky> oh no, it's the actual name
<Nova> :o
<SpyroD> 6hay, nintendo get a hold of this, they want my age
<drf|laptop> 03there's no way you could fix it and save it as MIDI?
<Sparky> Flandre's theme is "UN Owen Was Her"
<drf|laptop> 03Sparky, I know, but "Flandre's theme" is its other name :P
<Neon> We want it NOW.
<Sparky> ah
<Sparky> …
<Kyro> either way, since im like a MAJOR linkin park fan, i like it all :P
<SpyroD> 6anyway, wat you been up to?
<Sparky> well it's not the title is what I'm saying XD
<junh1024-XD> I could save as midi, but that would produce similar problems as the original one, so it's pointless.
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<Neon> Nope.
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03what exactly causes those problems?
<SpyroD> 6OK?, just Y!?
<Skylands> 10Consider me a veteran fan
<drf|laptop> 03is it just too many notes at once?
<Icydragon> 12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jItz-uNjoZA
<junh1024-XD> yeah
<Sparky> you want to find the MIDI?
<Icydragon> 12Our theme song neon ;D
<Sparky> 'kay
<Garochi> 12cheese
<junh1024-XD> too many MIDI events close to each other,
<Neon> If we had, that would be a sorry excuse for a planned joke. xD
<Kyro> got a hoodie, got dogtags, got a hat, got a wrist band, etc :P phone cover :P yeaaah XD
<Sparky> let me check some things
*Quilava squeak :(
*Skylands has the wristband. :3
<drf|laptop> 03Sparky, I have the MIDI
<Sparky> oh
<Skylands> 10wearing it right now
<drf|laptop> 03there's a link in the description
<drf|laptop> 03what I want to know
<drf|laptop> 03is what program they used
<drf|laptop> 03to make that video
<Sparky> yeah, that's what I was confused about
<drf|laptop> 03because obviously it's like
<Sparky> oh, okay
<drf|laptop> 03the only thing
<drf|laptop> 03that can play it
<drf|laptop> 03without crashing
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<Kyro> lolz i wear everything to school XD
<drf|laptop> 03I mean I even tried QuickTime
<drf|laptop> 03as much as I hate Apple
<drf|laptop> 03it failed just as much
<drf|laptop> 03even Sibelius the godlike MIDI program
<drf|laptop> 03can't play it for crap
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<Sparky> hmm, it's not in the description
<drf|laptop> 03<junh1024-XD> too many MIDI events close to each other, <- MIDI events are notes?
<nickstr> I just saw a video from a tube camera which really makes me glad we moved over to CCD
<Sparky> I'll check the profile
<drf|laptop> 03what's the description say?
<junh1024-XD> notes are MIDI events,
<nickstr> lots of streaking and image sticking issues
<drf|laptop> 03Other than "here is a link to the MIDI"
<junh1024-XD> there are also other types of midi events, like sustain and pitch/tempo changes.
<Skylands> 10I was shocked to hear Waiting for the End on the radio
<junh1024-XD> sibelius is not a godlike MIDI program. it is a score program which has MIDI and VSTi/sf playback capabilities.
<Armageddon> ;o
<eXAKR> nickstr, link?
<Skylands> 10or why it is even on iTunes to begin with
<Skylands> 10it friggin sucks

<drf|laptop> 03but not by much
<nickstr> a camera using the Vidicon tube
<Sparky> things about what they used (from other vids) and links to other videos and a link to download the MIDI or the actual sheet music or the original vid and things like that
<Kyro> lolz going to their Concert tomorrow XD
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03and that program isn't ringing any bells, is it?
<SpyroD> 6what is up with that song?
<junh1024-XD> also, do you want to try kontakt sampler?
<drf|laptop> 03It has to be some Japanese thing though, because pretty much any YouTube videos I've seen that have a Japanese title and are about MIDI music, it's using that program LOL
<Icydragon> 12*pedo laugh*
<Sparky> o3o
<junh1024-XD> o3o
<drf|laptop> 03EW THAT FACE
<SpyroD> 6nintendofreak, I need a conversation!!!

<drf|laptop> 03I told LL to stop with the face LOL
<Kyro> lolz Phili, i think it said its tomorrow O.o

<drf|laptop> 03:P
<eXAKR> It sucks
<Neon> He was DOA.
<Neon> Sorry. :/
<SpyroD> 6he didnt say anything but he can see this
<junh1024-XD> i haet oxo because it's not the original o3o
<drf|laptop> 03how is o3o an original face?

<Skylands> 10You "think"?
<drf|laptop> 03how is ANY emoticon origina?
<drf|laptop> 03l
<eXAKR> But you will like to know that news organisations used these kind of cameras to record a lot of history
<SpyroD> 6what-ever
<Skylands> 10Then how can you be sure you're going?
<drf|laptop> 03people just use them at will
<Neon> Why so serious?
<Kyro> xD
<Kyro> brb
<Sparky> … well their first video is available as an MUS, which is stated can be only opened by Finale
<SpyroD> 6cause I can be
<drf|laptop> 03yeah

<drf|laptop> 03I have Finale.
<Espeon> Well that makes o3o just like every other one.
<drf|laptop> 03that's not what's used in the video :/
<Neon> :O Shut me down.
<junh1024-XD> CCD r also cheap
<drf|laptop> 03Espeon I never sai dit wasn't
<drf|laptop> 03it's just annoying, that's all
<Espeon> Ok.
<Sparky> hmm
<Icydragon> 12Let's make love
<drf|laptop> 03there are other annoying faces too
<drf|laptop> 03but people here don't use them as much
<Skylands> 10and Kyro
<Kyro> ?
<Skylands> 10the website says Pennsylvania was January 31...
<Espeon> I won't repeat what I've said many times earlier and instead just chuckle silently by myself.
<SpyroD> 6ooooooo, like i care
<Kyro> O.O
<Neon> Hold on, let me finish with my other partner.
<nickstr> they are now jun
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not saying people can't use it, I'm just saying EW THAT FACE
<nickstr> but were non-existant back in the early 1980s
<drf|laptop> 03You can still use it as much as you want, I'll just keep saying that
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<SpyroD> 6what your left hand?
<Icydragon> 12general?
<eXAKR> Indeed

<eXAKR> My first three years of life were spent there
<SpyroD> 6good one
<eXAKR> And I know how low-tech that era was compared to now
<Neon> That was so clever, I almost died.
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<Neon> Shock me, Paddle Girl.
<eXAKR> You 1990's and later people are so lucky when it comes to technology
<drf|laptop> 03I'm gonna go for a bit

<Armageddon> Drake

<Drake> 04Do so then
<Creideiki> I've also discovered that XVM/RSX when unpleased acts like The Computer in a Paranoia RPG...
<Creideiki> Except worse.
<Drake> 04Because it's AWESOME
<Skylands> 10Galaxy wars
<Armageddon> AW FUCK

<Armageddon> <Creideiki> Hmmm... I hath discovered something; apparently XVM/RSX /does not/ like being lied to about the number of disks in a system.
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> I also discovered that this shell does not have pico
<Armageddon> :D
<Armageddon> fail much
<NightSeas> D:
<Creideiki> Eww... no pico that must be... highly inconvienent.
<Creideiki> Suggestion: vi!
<Creideiki> (Or vim.)
<NightSeas> Hello junh ^^
<auscompgeek> [15:14] <WillPittenger> !8ball: Is auscompgeek a troll who trolls trolls?
<Altair> 8-ball says: 4 Ask again later
<auscompgeek> [15:14] <@firebot> WillPittenger: The answer is certainly yes.
<auscompgeek> lolfail Altair
<auscompgeek> !altair
<Armageddon> lol
<Creideiki> Or... emacs. (...Why do I suddenly feel like my soul is being consumed by horror and pain after saying that?)
<NightSeas> Well, looks like a gtg too
<NightSeas> I*
<NightSeas> Seeyas
<Creideiki> See you.
<SpyroD> finaly Its stop kicking me out
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Someone call for me?
<auscompgeek> hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh ;p
<auscompgeek> !floof
<Altair> :P
<auscompgeek> aww
<Armageddon> heya Armads
<Armads> sup
<SpyroD> 6the internet crashed for a minut, icy, nintendo, anyone
<Armageddon> I hate vim.
<Icydragon> 12huh...
<Creideiki> What's wrong with vim?
<Armageddon> I refuse to use that despicable piece of CRAP.
<SpyroD> 6ok, yea I can talk again
<Creideiki> emacs is worse. :P
<junh1024-XD> hi NightSeas_Away
<Armads> so like
<Creideiki> (There I felt that soul pain again.)
<Armads> after running Oblivion for four hours or so
<Armageddon> ;o
<Icydragon> 12so... what did you mean?
<Armads> the underside of my computer now causes second-degree burns on touch.
<Armads> XD
<Armageddon> SNEAS
*Armageddon hugs
<junh1024-XD> back from a logoff because a UI bug
<Armageddon> and lmfao
<junh1024-XD> damn windows >.>
<Creideiki> Could have been worse.
<Creideiki> Your PC might have caught fire. :P
<junh1024-XD> nah
<SpyroD> 6the last thing I sent, I dont know what hapend but Im back
<Armageddon> okay it's worse
<Armageddon> but pico > vim
<SpyroD> 6I had to restart my computer
<Armageddon> I can't stand vim
<Icydragon> 12ok
<SpyroD> 6yea it sucked, I thought no one would still be on, but I got here
<SpyroD> 6anyway, what now?
<Creideiki> It works in a pinch.
<Altair> vim is just different
<Creideiki> Also, it's not as bad as some... wonderful... editors that shall not be named.
<Icydragon> 12idk
<Icydragon> 12kristen?
<Creideiki> (I HATE Lisp machines... SO MUCH!)
<SpyroD> 6who?
<SpyroD> 6or what?
<Icydragon> 12just gotta check
<Altair> XD
<SpyroD> 6check what?
<Icydragon> 12nevermind
<SpyroD> 6ok
<Altair> x_x
<Icydragon> 12p
<Altair> Armads
<Armads> Altair
<Altair> before it was burned in a fire
<SpyroD> 6;) rawr
<Altair> my old laptop would smoke every time it was plugged in
<Armads> o.o
<Creideiki> Also... I HATE Lisp... SO MUCH!
<Creideiki> :P
<Altair> and before that, it would regularly power down after hitting around 75C or so
<Altair> :P
<Armads> lol
<Icydragon> 12raaaaaaaaaawr
<nickstr> I could NEVER use Linux or Mac OS as my primary operating system
<Armads> My old laptop used to do that all the time.
<SpyroD> 6RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRR
<Armads> At first I didn't know why, then I touched it.
<SpyroD> 6lol
<SpyroD> 6:/
<Armads> I think my finger still has the mark.
<Armads> :(
<Icydragon> 12hm
<junh1024-XD> and because people make software for windoze, people make software for windoze
<Altair> its a cruel cycle
<Creideiki> I don't mind which OS I use... as long as it doesn't mind people poking and prodding at its innards.
<Creideiki> Which Windows doesn't like... but usually doesn't mind.
<nickstr> its because of that plus specialized hardware
<nickstr> you try getting an Express Card TV tuner to work under Mac OS
<Altair> mac os is silly
<nickstr> IF you could afford the card after buying the computer
<SpyroD> 6sooooo, Its late, what to do, what to do
<Creideiki> Linux is... well seeing the fact I'm short of a supercomputer only becuase I don't have the money for the powerbill and I don't have enough PCs for a Beowulf boxen...
<Icydragon> 12dunno
<Altair> tap off your neighbors >:D
<Altair> :|
<Altair> Out of curiousity
<nickstr> in fact that brings up the biggest thing I have against Mac OS
<Altair> did it have a P4?
<nickstr> Apple's terrible price points
<Altair> I would NEVER buy any kind of Mac
<nickstr> they have the worst price/performance ratio out of any computer manufacturer today
<SpyroD> 6have you ever played any Halo games (conversation starter)
<Armads> nah, it was an AMD.
<Icydragon> 12nope
<Altair> $1500 Hackintosh > $4000 Mac Pro
<Altair> ah
<nickstr> correct
<SpyroD> 6oh, they're fun games
<Armads> It just has a poorly placed intake vent. lol
<Creideiki> Mac on the other hand... can best be summed up as: "You EDITED a CONFIG FILE!? How dare you! THAT WAS HORRIBLE! YOU HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SUBHUMAN BEING! I ORDERED YOU NOT TO DO THAT! DAS WAR EIN BEFEHEL! SIEG HEIL! SIEG HEIL!"
<Armads> which also happens to be the size of an unfolded paper clip.
<Altair> haha
<Icydragon> 12so ive heard
<nickstr> not to mention you can get the same Foxconn hardware in HP machines that you find in Macs these days for less than half the price
<junh1024-XD> eh? I do that occasinally, it doesn't complain.
<SpyroD> 6yea, and they take place,all in one years worth of time
<Altair> mine had three fans and holes all along the sides, bottom and back
<Creideiki> Also, the fact that Mac laptops are made in Taiwan by the same company that produces about most all the other laptops on the planet Earth, means you're paying for basically a not very well pimped Toshiba. :P
<Altair> putting a P4 into a laptop was plain stupid
<Armads> rofl
<SpyroD> 6but, not the best conversation at this point
<Altair> XD
<Armads> Did you build it yourself or something? I've never seen a retail laptop with that many fans.
<SpyroD> 6can you think of something to talk about?
<Altair> i waste 500gb of HD space just to say i fought steve jobs
<Creideiki> It's like making a Trabant into a pimpmobile... sure it looks blingtastic... but you're going to get about a half block before the engine stalls.
<Altair> haha
<SpyroD> 6can be something random, like Halo
<Icydragon> 12Soso
<Icydragon> 12Love
<Altair> it was my brothers, and apparently he custom ordered it
<Icydragon> 12Kingdom hearts?
<Altair> brother's lol
<nickstr> plus if you want a flashy OS you can just get PC-BSD
<nickstr> its very similar to Mac OS X at the kernel level
<SpyroD> 6goog game,but never played it
<Icydragon> 12:o
<Icydragon> 12You should
<Altair> i can use linux as a daily operating system, but os x is a nono
<Umbreon> 12!anagram Altair
<SpyroD> 6I want to
<Umbreon> 12-define cookie
<Altair> and yeah pc-bsd is good
<Altair> oops
<Creideiki> Or just use Compiz on a Linux box. :P
<Altair> XD
<Altair> i had it turned off
<Umbreon> 12yeah
<Creideiki> (I forget if Compiz also works on BSD.)
<Umbreon> 12i'm well aware how it lags you
<Altair> compiz is pure win
<nickstr> I could not do that
<Icydragon> 12Kh 2 is the best, what systems do you have?
<Armads> lol
<Altair> though it's 110% unnecessary XD
<nickstr> because I use some programs that are Windows specific without any Linux equivalents
<SpyroD> 6almost all of them
<junh1024-XD> because I use some programs that are Mac specific without any Windows equivalents
<SpyroD> 6just not the realy old ones
<Altair> is there such a thing?
<nickstr> no
<junh1024-XD> sure is
<Altair> lol
<Creideiki> My desktop (which is getting to be old...) is a dual Ubuntu (ugh)/Windows XP system.
<Icydragon> 12Well then you could get them all I guess
<SpyroD> 6I could try
<nickstr> some of the audio processing tools I use are Windows only
<SpyroD> 6but, no garenty
<Altair> i have 7 and debian on one HDD, and another with osx86
<Creideiki> My future plans once I get a new box, and this one is wiped/given to mom? Take her boring box, and my grandpa's boring old box... and begin Project Excelsior.
<Altair> though im planning on wiping my osx86 since i never use it
<Creideiki> And if you're wondering, yes I name my PCs.
<Altair> :P
<Creideiki> All after various ships in Star Trek. :P
<nickstr> the processing tools are fairly important for one thing I do
<SpyroD> 6.......
<nickstr> because the hardware equivalents cost several thousand dollars
<Icydragon> 12Perhaps
<Altair> i've named all of my main computers "whirl" for the past 7-8 years
<SpyroD> 6yes?
<Altair> dunno why :D
<Creideiki> Currently, my box/box-that-was-mine-and-is-now-used-by-mom are named after Constitution-class ships.
<Ray> 02FFFFFF, now I'm trap'd in Nico Nico Douga's music ;-;
<Icydragon> 12Yyyyyeees
<Creideiki> (No, nothing has "Enterprise" as a name yet... becuase if I name it that I'm guaranteed to have something strange happening every half minute.)
<Altair> LOL
<SpyroD> 6nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
<SpyroD> 6oooooooooooooooo
<SpyroD> 6fine
<Creideiki> Mum has Defiant. I have Hood. Next box is Lexington.
<SpyroD> 6lol
<Icydragon> 12lololololol
<Creideiki> My grandfather's boxes are all named after the Daedalus-class ships.
<SpyroD> 6lmao
<SpyroD> 6lmfao
<Creideiki> (Former box is Daedalus, current is Icarus, next is Phoenix.)
<Creideiki> Project Excelsior is named after... well watch Star Trek III once. :P
<Altair> it's been a while since i last saw III
<nickstr> I use Stereo Tool for on air AM and FM processing and cannot find Linux equivalents of this at all
<Creideiki> (Because of it's radical departure from the ships of TOS design, the Excelsior is my codename for a planned Beowulf cluster.)
<Altair> or any of the old series for that matter :(
<SpyroD> 6hmmmmmmmmmm
<Altair> and random, but senior citizens who know how to use computers FTW
<Altair> heh
<Armageddon> ;o
<nickstr> the hardware equivalents cost a great deal of money even at the low end
<Armageddon> heya Zephyr
<SpyroD> 6is this going to be an all night chat, or what
<Altair> i really should make it work for a select few
<SpyroD> 6?
<Altair> because often times when someone uses it, 30 others try it as well
<Altair> :P
<nickstr> plus how often do you see a processor designed for AM that operates in stereo rather than mono?
<Icy> Soom
<SpyroD> 6hello?
<Icy> Ho
<Icy> *hi
<SpyroD> 6did you change you user name?
<Creideiki> Currently planned server box (which may supercede Excelsior by one PC) is to be named after the Federation-class demi-canon ships.
<SpyroD> 6or are you new?
<Icy> I changed it
<SpyroD> 6ok, made me think you quit
<Creideiki> I'm currently stuck on whether to name it Unifactum, Compactat or Concordat.
<Icy> nah
<Creideiki> (Which are NCC-2102, NCC-2103 and NCC-2109 respectively.)
<SpyroD> 6dont scare me like that,I would have been alone
<Sneas> 03lgcsi
*Ascendant pokes Sakuya and the rest of the chat

<Icy> 12when the connection gets screwy you have to log in again, but your other name is still in so you have to change
<SpyroD> 6yea thats why I logout and resighn in
<SpyroD> 6keeps the name
<Armads> !define plumcot
<Icy> 12yeah...
<Armads> :(
*Armads goes to dictionary.com
<Creideiki> I get a bit too nerdy for my own good sometimes... :P
*nickstr np: Pokémon - Gotta Catch 'Em All (Pokemon Theme) [03:18m/192kbps/44kHz]
<Altair> it's perfectly acceptable :P
<Altair> yeah perhaps i should make a !define
<Altair> D:
<SpyroD> 6boy what a slow night
<Ascendant> also ignore my extremely badly formulated post
<Armads> lol
<Ascendant> just look at the first 2-3 lines
<Ascendant> and ignore the rest
<Ascendant> :{D
<Creideiki> My hobby list is exceptionally... insane.
<SpyroD> 6feels like I started hours ago, but only a few hours
<Altair> As the other topic was locked with everyone's agreement, we'll start a new one.
<Altair> Alright, so, what should we do? We've hopefully gotten past the "blame everyone" stage, so let's throw some good ideas out there. It's
<Altair> but
<Altair> but
<SpyroD> 6not even that long
<nickstr> that is an example of one weirdness that I have
<Altair> it makes no sense
*Altair shot
<nickstr> that song is actually going out on air
<Icy> 12i know right?
<Icy> 12hmhm, internet does that to you
<Ascendant> lmfao Altair
<Ascendant> XD
<SpyroD> 6wow, I wouldnt know this is the longest I've ever been on
<nickstr> if I had a better receiver I would make recordings
<Creideiki> nickstr: Suggestion - and I'm probably gonna get lambasted for this - suggested next song "These Times They are a Changin'" preferably the one done by The Seekers.
*nickstr np: Pokémon - Together Forever [03:55m/192kbps/44kHz]
<Armads> Some random bug was just flying around my room hitting its head on my light bulbs.
<SpyroD> 6havent had internet for the longest time
<Armads> Then it fell and stopped moving.
<Icy> 12makes sense
<Armads> Wonder if it burned itself.
<nickstr> I am thinking AM Radio by Everclear and I Only Wanna Be With You by Dusty Springfield
<Altair> it endured a heart attack
<SpyroD> 6yea
<Armageddon> o_O
<Quanyails> 7Good night.
<SpyroD> 6I like having internet, I can connect to other people
<Altair> yes, i am off to bed as well
<Creideiki> See you both.
<Creideiki> I'll probably be heading out in 10 minutes or so,
<Altair> night people
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7See ya.
<Sneas> 03wtf
<SpyroD> 6have you been on a spyro fansite called dark spyro forums, easyer to find on google
<Creideiki> I do have to wake early to get back to Brock after spending a week at home. :P
<Icy> 12its fun yes
<nickstr> in the case of airplay on here
<Armageddon> D:
<Icy> 12yeah i have
<Sneas> 03I just found out Luna has the same birthday as me o:
<Armageddon> seeya Altair
<Armageddon> o_O
<Sneas> 03o.o
<SpyroD> 6cool, Im on there as well
<nickstr> Brock?
<Creideiki> Brock University
<nickstr> oh
<Creideiki> In St. Catherine's (Ontario).
<Creideiki> I'm currently in Hamilton (Ontario).
<SpyroD> 6same name
*nickstr np: Everclear - AM Radio [03:46m/852kbps/44kHz]
<Icy> 12me too
<SpyroD> 6cool
<nickstr> that could be changed
<Icy> 12sweeeeeet
<SpyroD> 6yea, I had a bad start, but its geting better
<nickstr> instead of AM Radio more like AM Stereo
<nickstr> in fact I am playing this on 1450 AM right now
<Aurora> k...skylands isn't here
<Aurora> wonderful
<Aurora> ok
<nickstr> this sounds more dominant and in your face than normal AM
*nickstr np: Dusty Springfield - I Only Wanna Be With You [02:35m/991kbps/44kHz]

<Ascendant> there's a new topic

<Aurora> 6I'm merging it back
<Ascendant> why?
<Aurora> 6there's no reason to have two topics
<Ascendant> well
<Aurora> 6I'm upset skylands locked it
<Aurora> 6I'm unlocking it
<Ascendant> the current one is escalating into fail
<Aurora> 6because it actually was perfectly on topic
<Ascendant> .-.
<Aurora> 6I explained it earlier
<Aurora> 6yes, things are being said about each other

<Ascendant> You can merge my post or leave it out
<Armageddon> wb Caaz
<Armageddon> ohadjfasdf
<Aurora> 6I'll merge it in
<[MI]Sniper> wat
<Aurora> 6because even though I didn't read it through, it's most likely on topic
<Aurora> 6considering when you created the topic
<Aurora> 6it wasn't specific
<Aurora> 6it was a general topic that I assumed would invovle both problem and solutioh
<Aurora> 6solution
<Spyro> Icy?, I guess I'll see you tomaro?
<Spyro> 6;) see ya
*nickstr np: Dusty Springfield - You Don't Have To Say You Love Me [02:48m/832kbps/44kHz]

<Creideiki> Cheers everyone and see yall tomorrow.

<nickstr> how can a song from the 1960s have THAT much bass
<nickstr> holy cow!
<Armageddon> xD
<[MI]Sniper> Also accept vhost plox
<Ascendant> Ah okay @ Aurora
<Creideiki> (nickstr: As another random suggestion... try some classical, that's always a nice systems test. And also; for the random, give people an hourly newsdata transmission at 45.45 baud/S-bell Baudot RTTY for the woot.)
<Armageddon> oh
<Armageddon> note, we use #help/!request more than /hs request

<drf|laptop> 03I was going to say I'll stop going EW B/W as much
<Ascendant> 2b or not 2b
<drf|laptop> 03I did read Aurora
<drf|laptop> 03I've been refreshing the page all dya
<drf|laptop> 03just not bothered to quote and reply
<Ascendant> my maths teacher's favourite question
<Aurora> 6.....lol

<nickstr> you can do that all you want around me
<nickstr> the EW B/W thing
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03and I find it funny
<Aurora> 6ok
<drf|laptop> 03that nickstr, you were one of the ones raging over the EW thing
<nickstr> because I don't think I will be playing either one of those two games
<drf|laptop> 03back on hoshinet
<Aurora> 6guess I'll sit here and explain it out
<drf|laptop> 03which is ultimately where I got it from
<Aurora> 6once again
<drf|laptop> 03blame usotsuki for it, not me XD
<Ascendant> xd
<nickstr> he was the worst in it
<drf|laptop> 03he's the one who started it
<drf|laptop> 03I got it from him
<drf|laptop> 03heck
<drf|laptop> 03it caught on
<Ascendant> uso is cool
<drf|laptop> 03some of my IRL friends
<nickstr> mention something he hated and he would say EW *thing he hates*
<drf|laptop> 03now say EW stuff
<drf|laptop> 03it's awesome
<Aurora> 6I say this chat needs to learn tolerance, I predict you say "learn to tolerate my ews"
<Ascendant> xD
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03I wasn't going to say that at all
<drf|laptop> 03in fact
<Aurora> 6understandable, but you don't seem to understand just HOW MUCH people tolerate out of you
<drf|laptop> 03I was going to say on the forum
<nickstr> I found it annoying there because he kept bashing every little thing
<Aurora> 6wow have you learned?
<Aurora> 6ok then, my mistake
<drf|laptop> 03that I'll work on not saying EW B/W as much
<NightSeas> Hi Aurora :3
<drf|laptop> 03now
<drf|laptop> 03I will *never* stop saying EW APPLE
<drf|laptop> 03but
<drf|laptop> 03I only do that
<nickstr> I mean EVERY SINGLE THING
<drf|laptop> 03when people bring it up
<Aurora> 6tone it down
<drf|laptop> 03and recently that hasn't been much at all
<drf|laptop> 03so
<Aurora> 6drf, that's the thing
<drf|laptop> 03I don't think *that* is the problem
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03the B/W thing, well
<drf|laptop> 03I realize with the games coming out soon
<Aurora> 6those situations are when you just need to shut up
<SilverSonic> LMFAO ROFL LMAO, I was in probably THE funniest skype call EVER XD
<drf|laptop> 03that people are going to be talking about it
<NightSeas> lol, drf may always be drf
<drf|laptop> 03and there's nothing I can do to sto pit
<drf|laptop> 03So I'll stop with that
<Aurora> 6it is not your job to automatically comment in the conversation to say ew
<drf|laptop> 03but seriously, who here doesn't know that I hate Apple? It's like... why do people even care?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I don't
<drf|laptop> 03it's not like I return from AFK to say that
<drf|laptop> 03and then leave again
<eXAKR> !ew Apple haters
<drf|laptop> 03well I did once
<drf|laptop> 03eXAKR, desktop's off :(

<drf|laptop> 03I blame the dorm staff
<Aurora> 6just....don't comment at all
<Aurora> 6yes, we know you hate apple
<drf|laptop> 03OK but see
<Aurora> 6and for the most part, we're completely sick of it
<drf|laptop> 03toning it down != stopping en6tirely
<Aurora> 6it's gotten old
<Aurora> 6REALLY fast
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<drf|laptop> 03honestly
<drf|laptop> 03look in your logs if you want
<drf|laptop> 03and I can bet you
<Ascendant> tbqh if people are offended by it then it's really their own fault
<Aurora> 6tone it down A LOT
<drf|laptop> 03that I haven't gone EW APPLE more than like 10 times in the past month
<Aurora> 6ascendant
<drf|laptop> 03it's mostly *other things* that I say EW to
<Aurora> 6what of the new people, as we mentioned in the topic
<drf|laptop> 03also Ascendant, qft
<drf|laptop> 03Aurora, well, what new people? :P
<Aurora> 6it HAS HAPPENED where new people walk in
<drf|laptop> 03I realize we have less of them here but
<drf|laptop> 03usually there aren't
<Ascendant> well that's true
<drf|laptop> 03so

<drf|laptop> 03I did, why
<Aurora> 6and some people can take it offensively
<Sparky||Stuff> you've laughed multiple times at my mac applications :U
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03you know now that I'm joking around, right? :P
<Aurora> 6it's one thing for people to say "why so serious"
<NightSeas> I like them as sweet as they can be :3
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Ascendant> xD
<Sparky||Stuff> but I don't really mind 'cause you say that about many things that I seem to like C:
<Aurora> 6but in all seriousness...it's just old crap now >.>
<drf|laptop> 03again
<drf|laptop> 03I haven't even done that much at all recently
<drf|laptop> 03go look at logs if you want
<Aurora> 6just, keep it toned down
<drf|laptop> 03I mean other than yesterday when I was like "Random, but EW IPADS"
<drf|laptop> 03and that was me ranting about the Verizon store
<drf|laptop> 03because I kid you not, they turned HALF THE STORE into an Apple store
<Aurora> 6ok ok I'm done
<drf|laptop> 03which made me rage pretty hard at them IRL
<Ascendant> lmfao
<drf|laptop> 03I walk in there
<drf|laptop> 03I'm like
<Sparky||Stuff> yeah, that was lame
<drf|laptop> 03you have FOUR IPHONES AND TWO IPADS ON DISPLAY
<drf|laptop> 03you have ONE of each of the other phones
<drf|laptop> 03WHY
<drf|laptop> 03Why do you need 4 iPhones?
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, OK, have one
<drf|laptop> 03maybe two
<drf|laptop> 03that's fine
<Sparky||Stuff> because they're popular
<drf|laptop> 03they're all the same phone
<drf|laptop> 03that's not the point Sparky
<drf|laptop> 03I mean display models
<Sparky||Stuff> oh
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> Drake
<drf|laptop> 03like, the ones sitting out that people can use
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03They had an entire wall devoted to iPhone + iPad
<Armageddon> tbqh I liked Anakin when he looked normal
<drf|laptop> 03it's just stupid honestly
<Armageddon> instead of the mechanic darth vader
<Armageddon> XD
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, I'm not even going EW IPHONE, even
<drf|laptop> 03Now that Verizon sells the iPhone
<drf|laptop> 03I can understand if they want to have them on display
<Sparky||Stuff> haven't been to a Verizon store since my sister got her phone updated
<drf|laptop> 03but do they really need FOUR of them?
<Sparky||Stuff> and that time I was really just sitting and drawing

<drf|laptop> 03isn't it easier to type . . .
<Aurora> 6and even now
<drf|laptop> 03than do some sort of alt code
<Sparky||Stuff> not really
<eXAKR> You still using mIRC 6.x?
<drf|laptop> 03or whatever you do
<Aurora> 6with less than an hour
<drf|laptop> 03Yes I am eXAKR
<Aurora> 6only 8 posts in total are there
<drf|laptop> 036.21 is awesome
<Sparky||Stuff> it's sort of like me typing acksf acksf acksf
<Sparky||Stuff> instead of something else
<eXAKR> Explains things
<drf|laptop> 03wait what
<drf|laptop> 03you don't have a . key?
<eXAKR> mIRC 7.1 and higher is uncode
<Aurora> 6acksf?
<Sparky||Stuff> Kyu was always saying "how do you type it that fast D:"
<Sparky||Stuff> acksf acksf acksf
<eXAKR> therefore it can display such characters with no problems
<Sparky||Stuff> acksfacksfackfs
<eXAKR> …
<Sparky||Stuff> acksfacksfacksf
<eXAKR> ..
<drf|laptop> 03yeah well the GUI of the new mIRC's sucks :/
<eXAKR> ...
<Sparky||Stuff> not really much effort
<Sparky||Stuff> GUI?
*eXAKR puts drf|laptop on the QUICKLY ROTATING PLATFORM!!!
<drf|laptop> 03GUI.
<drf|laptop> 03as in
<drf|laptop> 03the way it looks
<eXAKR> Anyway, later
<drf|laptop> 03since after all
<Sparky||Stuff> oh
<drf|laptop> 03IRC itself hasn't changed since the 1980s
<Sparky||Stuff> ah
<drf|laptop> 03it's just the programs used to get on it that change
<Aurora> 6hmm...
<drf|laptop> 03and the newer mIRC versions look dumb IMHO
<Aurora> 6wth O_o
<Sparky||Stuff> XD
<drf|laptop> 03so I'm like, why update?
<drf|laptop> 03since it's just text
<drf|laptop> 03but that black square is just pissing me off
<NightSeas> lol, see why
<Aurora> 6my mum has the computer monitor sitting on a stack of printer paper
<Sparky||Stuff> …
<drf|laptop> 03and I really don't get why it's doing that
<drf|laptop> 03unless
<Sparky||Stuff> why…?
<Aurora> 6I never noticed it was printer paper, but it's been there for years..
<drf|laptop> 03maybe this font isn't working with it
<Ascendant> <drf|laptop> yeah well the GUI of the new mIRC's sucks :/
<Aurora> 6and yet
<Sparky||Stuff> lol
<drf|laptop> 03why @ what/
<Ascendant> I like the GUI of 6.35
<drf|laptop> 03I don't
<drf|laptop> 03they changed all the icons
<Aurora> 6we like....run out of paper and buy more
<drf|laptop> 03which is dumb
<drf|laptop> 03the /a key for scripts
<drf|laptop> 03the s-> key for send
<Aurora> 6WHY IS THIS ON A STACK OF PAPER?
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<Ascendant> xD
<Sparky||Stuff> XD
<Sparky||Stuff> because your mother is silly
<Aurora> 6WHAT LOGIC IS THIS
<Aurora> 6I mean seriously
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03weird.
<Ascendant> I know a lot of mIRC's commands and everything
<Ascendant> but not x-chat's
<drf|laptop> 03I changed my font and I can see the "..."
<Aurora> 6then again, we are realted
<Aurora> 6related
<drf|laptop> 03but this font looks sooooo stupid
<Ascendant> even though I've been using that for several months
<Ascendant> erm
<Ascendant> 2 months
<Sparky||Stuff> ahahaha
<drf|laptop> 03hm

<auscompgeek> heh
<Aurora> 6good mother of arceus, my health class is about to get painful
<drf|laptop> 03doesn't it take more than 3 keystrokes to make a Unicode character?
<Sparky||Stuff> becaaaaaause that requires moving down
<Sparky||Stuff> :'D
<auscompgeek> the spambot is on the dronebl
<Aurora> 6the next 3 weeks will be torture
<Sparky||Stuff> gaaaaaah health

<drf|laptop> 03what do you press?
<drf|laptop> 03because last I checked
<Sparky||Stuff> alt-;
<drf|laptop> 03Mac OSX was similar to Linux for that
<Sparky||Stuff> …
<drf|laptop> 03¶
<drf|laptop> 03it does that here
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Sparky||Stuff> ahaha
<drf|laptop> 03well

<drf|laptop> 03like
<Sparky||Stuff> that's alt-7 for me
<drf|laptop> 03hold control and shift
<drf|laptop> 03then press u and e and 9
<drf|laptop> 03before letting go
<drf|laptop> 03it should make a é
<Aurora> 6now we get into the area of health I really would rather sleep through...or something
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03The fun part :D
*drf|laptop hides
<Sparky||Stuff> …
<Sparky||Stuff> I get that with alt-e e
<Aurora> 6because I know what you're talking about, only next week is that topic
<Sparky||Stuff> é
<drf|laptop> 03hm weird
<Aurora> 6the weeks after aren't
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<drf|laptop> 03Aurora
<drf|laptop> 03something that LL agreed with me on
<drf|laptop> 03when I mentioned it to her on voice chat
<drf|laptop> 03why are we still considering TST chat "PG" rated, since there's a new 13 and up rule
<drf|laptop> 03why can't it be PG-13 LOL
<Sparky||Stuff> I mean I could try switching to Dvorak and see if that changes anything
<drf|laptop> 03since we *SHOULDN'T* have any little kids
<drf|laptop> 03o_O
<drf|laptop> 03Dvorak changes the entire key layout
<Sparky||Stuff> because there still are
<NightSeas> I could not agree more
<drf|laptop> 03no there aren't o.o
<Aurora> 6my views on that are weird
<drf|laptop> 03if there are, then they're here against regulations
<drf|laptop> 03because the rules say you have to be 13 to join >_>
<drf|laptop> 03the only exception was those who were already here
<Aurora> 6PG we use as a term, nt necessarily the age group
<drf|laptop> 03but I don't know of any that were on the chat
<Sparky||Stuff> Cynder?
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Aurora> 6meaning, some topics really shouldn't be discussed in here
<drf|laptop> 03Cyncer hardly ever comes on
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Aurora> 6that being one of them
<drf|laptop> 03people seem to get annoyed when I make suggestive comment
<drf|laptop> 03s
<drf|laptop> 03it's like
<drf|laptop> 03I never acutally say anything dirty
<Ascendant> o-o
<drf|laptop> 03I just make hints at stuff
<drf|laptop> 03so I dunno what's so bad about it
<Ascendant> I'm the one
<drf|laptop> 03and LL agrees XD
<Aurora> 6it's rude to many people o.o
<Ascendant> who says dirty stuff
<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> So if anything
<Ascendant> that stuff would be my fault
<Sparky||Stuff> I agree with Roara
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03how is it rude
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Armageddon> derp
<Aurora> 6typical guy response there imo lol
<drf|laptop> 03if I just make a random "that's what she said" comment

<drf|laptop> 03"No watching R rated movies until you're 18"
<Sparky||Stuff> WISH
<Sparky||Stuff> ROARA
<Aurora> 6I just find it rude for people to be making jokes about that kind of stuff..
<NightSeas> Nope, this chat needs to be friendly to ALL ages. Because I leave chat room that are not
<drf|laptop> 03despite the fact that it says 17

<NightSeas> But yeah, sorry for anything I might have said, just make sure there’s no PG 13 thing :P
<Sparky||Stuff> the thing that both NightSeas and Roara asked me about
<drf|laptop> 03ffs, this font sucks
<drf|laptop> 03Fixedsys Excelsior
<drf|laptop> 03it works fine for normal displays
<drf|laptop> 03but for people who need "larger text"
<drf|laptop> 03it fails
<drf|laptop> 03I need a larger font size because of the insanely high screen resolution of my laptop x.x
<drf|laptop> 03well I guess when I see black squares from Sparky I'll just have to associate it with a "..." :/
<Sparky||Stuff> hmm
<drf|laptop> 03AP - The action fantasy "The Last Airbender"  about people who can command fire, air, water and earth  now controls something else: the Razzie awards for Hollywood's worst film achievements of 2010.

<drf|laptop> 03I went to Walmart
<Aurora> 6well
<NightSeas> I loved StarWars episode 3 too
<drf|laptop> 03the lady just hit "yes this customer is old enough"
<drf|laptop> 03wihtout even asking me
<drf|laptop> 03I was only 18
<drf|laptop> 03she must have thought I looked a lot older
<Aurora> 6one can in particular, a dust spray of some sort
<drf|laptop> 03weird o.o
<drf|laptop> 03they aren't strict about R rated movies?

<SilverSonic> lolool
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Aurora> 6I carded this woman for the aerosol can
<Aurora> 6and she looked at me like I'd slapped her in the face
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Aurora> 6she's like "excuse me?"
<drf|laptop> 03you should have just slapped her in the face for that
*drf|laptop runs
<Aurora> 6I asked if I could see her ID
<Aurora> 6she had the pen for the credit scanner in her hand
<Aurora> 6and basically tossed it onto the conveyor bel
<Aurora> 6belt
<NightSeas> lol
<Aurora> 6she then proceded to aggressively dig out her ID and said "You must be new, good lord"
<Aurora> 6which...I don't take kindly to that as that was a direct offense of my job imo, but I said "No ma'am, I'm not new actually...I'm supposed to do this"
<Aurora> 6thing is, we need to scan ID, so when she just showed it to me, I asked if she could take it out
<junh1024-XD> now now people,
<Aurora> 6she gave me the card, I scanned it, finished the transaction, and she asked "Now why on earth did you card me?"
<junh1024-XD> why dontu put them up on notalwaysright.com ?
*junh1024-XD hides
<Aurora> 6I explained that the computer would not allow the product to be sold unless I had the ID, as company policty
<Aurora> 6policy
<Aurora> 6she then said "That's complete BS (the full term...)" and crumpled the reciept and threw it back into my station
<Aurora> 6the next customer was so nice and was like "I am so sorry"
<Aurora> 6I'm like lol
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03I can just imagine Target stores in Texas

<Ascendant> I'm just like, really high right now
<lightumbreon> you can't be serious
<Ascendant> nothing I say atm means anything okay?
<Ascendant> well lightumbreon, at first glance, do you think I am a boy or girl?
<Ascendant> without checking on the forums
<lightumbreon> mmmm, at first glance?
<lightumbreon> Other
<lightumbreon> eh i mean, Female
<lightumbreon> XD
<Ascendant> Really? most would think I'm a guy
<lightumbreon> hm, i've got a different vision on peoples personalities
<Ascendant> Would you think the same if I used the username Nightshadow or Armageddon?
<lightumbreon> actually, then it would be a little mixed
<Ascendant> there you go then
<Ascendant> the only place I use Ascendant is here
<Ascendant> Everywhere else I use Armageddon
<Ascendant> Or Lucien
<Ascendant> Lucien would definitely be taken as a boy
<lightumbreon> ah, ok
<Ascendant> But it's from like...oblivion
<lightumbreon> and the correct awnser was?
<Ascendant> I am a girl
<lightumbreon> mmm, tell me, am i the only one who guessed it right the first time?
<Ascendant> pretty much
<Ascendant> although, I'm using Ascendant here
<Ascendant> so idk
<Ascendant> But yeah, most people think I'm a guy at first glance
<Ascendant> Whether it be from my nick or personality
<lightumbreon> most people think i'm a girl at first glance here
<Ascendant> that's because of your nick
<Ascendant> nicks say a lot of things about people
<lightumbreon> yea
<lightumbreon> other than my gaming tag
<Ascendant> What is your first impression about my nick?
<Ascendant> I don't game so I wouldn't know
<lightumbreon> First impression?
<lightumbreon> mmmm.......
<lightumbreon> Acsendant, as in Playfully, understanding, Intelligent, Freindly......
<lightumbreon> and do i smell a little shyness?
<Ascendant> ahahaha
<Ascendant> That's slightly funny
<Ascendant> Actually that's really funny
<lightumbreon> it is?
<Ascendant> But well, it depends on how well I know you or how I feel about you
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> You see, if I don't know you very well and I don't like you because you're annoying
<Ascendant> I can be rather cold towards you
<lightumbreon> well, thanks
<lightumbreon> XD
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> If I like you or you're one of my best friends
<Ascendant> then I'm more of what you described me as
<Ascendant> funnily enough though
<Ascendant> !define Ascendant
<[TST]Bot> -!- position or state of being dominant or in control; "that idea was in the ascendant"
<Ascendant> That's the meaning of my nick
<lightumbreon> touché
<Ascendant> My nick comes from the Yu-gi-oh card Blackwing - Silverwind the Ascendant
<Ascendant> derp ;p
<Ascendant> your nick obviously is some sort of oxymoron
<Ascendant> well not really
<Ascendant> but yeah
<Ascendant> light + umbreon
<lightumbreon> mmmmm, comes close
<lightumbreon> now you try, guess what my nick means
<Ascendant> !define lightumbreon
<[TST]Bot> -!- No results found
*Ascendant mauled
<Ascendant> okay I mean
<Ascendant> well, from the first glance of your nick
<Ascendant> I would say you're a...
<Ascendant> caring, cheerful, optimistic person but also a little mysterious at times
<lightumbreon> almost
<Ascendant> derp
<lightumbreon> want a hint?
<Ascendant> sure
<lightumbreon> don't freak out, kay?
<lightumbreon> !define autism
<[TST]Bot> -!- (psychiatry) an abnormal absorption with the self; marked by communication disorders and short attention span and inability to treat others as people
<lightumbreon> what the-
<Ascendant> why would i freak out at that lol
<Ascendant> I have a lot of friends that have ADHD or are autistic
<Ascendant> There's nothing wrong with that
<Ascendant> you're just like any other person tbqh
<Ascendant> you sure as hell don't act like it though xD
<lightumbreon> i know, but why say inabillity to take others as people
<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> well
<lightumbreon> nothing wrong, but that isn't me
<Ascendant> as long as you don't use it as an excuse
<Ascendant> I'm fine
<lightumbreon> nah, it isn't an excuse after all
<Ascendant> I hate idiots who use ADHD or similar as excuses for their unintelligent behavious
<Ascendant> erm
<Ascendant> behaviour*
<Ascendant> let me name a few
<Ascendant> D-ray, Lugia365, who else...
<Ascendant> There's a few but I'm braindead atm
<lightumbreon> lol
<Ascendant> and I have no idea why I'm being so friendly today, either
<lightumbreon> me neither
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> usually on this network I hate on all the newbies
<lightumbreon> why is that? are they so annoying then?
<Ascendant> yep
<lightumbreon> okay, XD
<Ascendant> I just get easily irritated at those sort of people
<Ascendant> usually I'm indifferent
<Ascendant> but it's a different matter with them
<lightumbreon> sometimes, i am too
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> okay I need to go
<Ascendant> so I'll be back in maybe 10 minutes
<Ascendant> if not
<Ascendant> in about...9 hours
<lightumbreon> Okies, Bye then

<HyperMetalLugia> Some more posts, but noting much
<lightumbreon> hiya Quan
<Quanyails> 7Hey, light.
<Quanyails> 7Don't you wish we had a reset button around here?
<drf|laptop> 03reset button? o.o
<lightumbreon> why?
<Quanyails> 7Topic.
<lightumbreon> ah, i see, not really paying attetion on it, it's not my buissness
<lightumbreon> i think
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah
<Sakuya> Nah
<Sakuya> Life goes on
<Quanyails> 7True.
<drf|laptop> 03god I swear though
<Sakuya> We're just leaning
<drf|laptop> 03Articuno must have turned her friends against me :/
<Sakuya> ...
<drf|laptop> 03she was all "My friends don't want you there"
<Sakuya> learning
<drf|laptop> 03referring to her private chat
<drf|laptop> 03I'm like
<drf|laptop> 03what
<Sakuya> its not that they've turned against you
<Sakuya> Its just...that circle
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<Sakuya> But instead of being here, its somewhere else
<drf|laptop> 03what circle though
<drf|laptop> 03all of the UK members I thought were fine with me
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here o.o
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Sakuya> It's not that they're against you
<drf|laptop> 03ugh, it's not really TST that has changed, but Articuno :/
<Sakuya> Its like me and my channel
<Quanyails> 7I'm sure this is a dissonant time for this, but Arti might as well be a figuratively literal Broken Bird.
<Sakuya> I don't let you in there
<drf|laptop> 03well that's because the people on your channel aren't really friends with me
<drf|laptop> 03also LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03now that I'm a server admin I can technically get on any channel I want and set myself as an op
*drf|laptop hides
<Sakuya> Not what I was getting at
<drf|laptop> 03but see
<drf|laptop> 03I won't
<drf|laptop> 03because I'm not that kind of person
<Sakuya> Its just having a circle, and then if someone isn't that circle its weird
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<drf|laptop> 03EW THA....OK I'll hold myself back
<drf|laptop> 03but seriously why does everyone need to have circles :/
<Sakuya> That's life
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, I PM lots of people but it's not like I'm gonna go make my own group of friends
<Quanyails> 7It's human behavior.
<drf|laptop> 03in fact I tried once
<drf|laptop> 03nobody joined. LOL
<Quanyails> 7You know cliques?
<drf|laptop> 03EW CLIQUES
<drf|laptop> 03I avoid them like the plague.
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Sakuya> Again, your opinion
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh goodness
<Sakuya> But cliques happen
<drf|laptop> 03did I ever act as if it wasn't my opinion>?
<drf|laptop> 03I love how people keep pointing that out
<drf|laptop> 03Yes I know it's my opinion, what of it
<Sakuya> Probably your timing
<drf|laptop> 03k
<HyperMetalLugia> We should all just make a thread with all the circles created and the users in them
<HyperMetalLugia> But that's a 100% bad idea~
<Sakuya> Um...that's stupid and probably impossible
<Sakuya> I mean theres obvious circles like mine
<Aristeo> sooooooooo
<Aristeo> rawr
<HyperMetalLugia> You, Aero, Sheena, Feather ( I would think)
<Sakuya> And then some that are not obvious
<Sakuya> Um no
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<Feather> 10o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> These circles are blah anyway
<Sakuya> That's my point
<Sakuya> Circles aren't just friends
<Sakuya> Its a group
<Sakuya> Which can overlap with other circles
<HyperMetalLugia> Timing much
<Sakuya> Speaking of sheena
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Sheena
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<SheenaFox> hi HML
<SheenaFox> what timing
<Sakuya> We were talking about you
<Sakuya> Sorta
<Sakuya> Anyways
<HyperMetalLugia> About friends and circles
<SheenaFox> Oh
<SheenaFox> But why kinda me XD
<drf|laptop> 03<Sakuya> Its a group <Sakuya> Which can overlap with other circles <- So in other words, venn diagrams
*drf|laptop hides
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<SheenaFox> lol
<Damos> 13Why did I think of something naughty with that comment
<Sakuya> Circles happen, their openness varies
<HyperMetalLugia> A bad one if most
<drf|laptop> 03the people in the middle are the AWESOME section
<Damos> 13!floof
<Damos> 13!floof

*Skylands flooooooooofs all over Damos "Bow down to my floofiness!"
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm in there too 8D
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah honestly I can't stand cliques
<Sakuya> And yeah....venn diagram is a good metaphor here
<Damos> 13I love floof
*Damos huggles
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03it could just be me.
<drf|laptop> 03like
<drf|laptop> 03my friends aren't friends with each other
<drf|laptop> 03so I can't really make a group even if I wanted to.
<Sakuya> Its not really a clique though
<drf|laptop> 03plus I prefer talking to people 1 on 1.
<Sakuya> Its just a circle
<drf|laptop> 03I wasn't the one who used the word clique originally.
<drf|laptop> 03go blame Quany LOL
<Sakuya> I know lol
<Quanyails> 7D:
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad Quan :(
<Sakuya> Just stating the difference
*HyperMetalLugia gives her a punishment- No Tropes or YT for a week
<Quanyails> 7Apologies.
<Damos> 13brb Lugias
<SheenaFox> brb food
<Sakuya> Cliques are usually groups of people who are the same
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Sakuya> Circles...people can be complete opposites
<drf|laptop> 03Also LOL circles
<drf|laptop> 03I keep thinking of the movie I Now Pronouce You Chuck and Larry
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLthat
<HyperMetalLugia> That movie was weird
<HyperMetalLugia> Though, I didn't see too much of it
<Sakuya> Heck, circles can be just 2 people
<Sakuya> Drf and ascendant could be considered a circle
<Espeon> It's just natural, there's nothing weird about it at all lol.
<drf|laptop> 03two points is just a line
<HyperMetalLugia> I guess with them at the right position, they can be in a 360* XD
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<drf|laptop> 03or a 69 :O
*drf|laptop hides
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad :P
<Espeon> As long as people don't go all OMG UR NOT IN MY CIRCLE YOU'RE NOT COOL or something.
<Espeon> Of course.
<HyperMetalLugia> Wait, isn't thayt like the same thing?
<drf|laptop> 03isn't what
<HyperMetalLugia> If you close up the 69... nvm
<HyperMetalLugia> Back to the main point..
<drf|laptop> 03that's a 180
<drf|laptop> 03not a 360
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm, well I guess a circle of people would work then
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> "Hey gaiz, lets just lay on the floor and make a huge circle!"
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03yeah well
<drf|laptop> 03this is not the place for that but there is such a thing ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> And Espeon, you're not cool enough to join my circle ;P
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes ;3
*HyperMetalLugia killed
<Sakuya> The thing is, people want the inner circle gone...
<Sakuya> Imo, the inner circle is all of us who know each other
<drf|laptop> 03gah that term circles
<drf|laptop> 03too confusing
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah .c.
<drf|laptop> 03because it could mean anything
<drf|laptop> 03whatever
<Sakuya> Back to what espeon said, just keep open to new people
<HyperMetalLugia> Could we just use "these people who perfer these people over these people?"
<Sakuya> Circles won't be a problem
<Sakuya> Its not preference lol
<Espeon> Really, the only way they can be a problem is if people get a feeling of "I'm inferior because I'm not part of that circle"
<Sakuya> But I've wasted too much energy on this topic
<HyperMetalLugia> [15:03] <%drf|laptop> 03too confusing < Agreed
<Espeon> Just be friendly and things will be alright.
<drf|laptop> 03well
<HyperMetalLugia> Indeed ;(
<drf|laptop> 03Espeon, that or if the circle goes "You're inferior if you're not a part of this circle"
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Espeon> Well then they should get a life
<Espeon> :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh Espie, you're a genius

<lightumbreon> oh....right
<Ascendant> nah
<Ascendant> some random person also decided to attack me for 'continuing the thread' lol
<Ascendant> http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6744.msg258244#msg258244
<Ascendant> "ascendant, now we can let this topic rest in peace... move on for God's sake"
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> Someone explain to me what I did lol?
<Espeon> Wouldn't call it an attack.
<Espeon> But at the same time I can't make a "Calling that a x is like calling y a z" joke
<Espeon> :<
<Ascendant> XD
<Sakuya> That was the same person who's been raging about this whole thing, wasnt it
<Ascendant> well not exactly an attack
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Ascendant> apparently Sunny went and PM'd Skylands
<Ascendant> about it and wanted the topic 'closed' because it was 'dangerous' and could 'destroy the site' or something
<HyperMetalLugia> Lawls
<Sakuya> I probably should have deleted that one...
<Ascendant> it was completely irrevelant anyway roflamo
<Ascendant> roflmao*
<Sakuya> That post if yours was the one from the new topic I merged
<Sakuya> Of
<Ascendant> I suspect it was posted in my new topic
<Sakuya> As were the two post after it
<Ascendant> because Sunny was like to Skylands (when it was locked) "Thank you yadadadadada:
<Sakuya> My post was the first back in that topic
<Espeon> ENORMOUS POWERS
<Espeon> done
<Espeon> okay
<Ascendant> oh yeah
<Ascendant> lmaaaaaao
<HyperMetalLugia> Lets make Sunny a mod and see what she does to the threads ;p
<Espeon> And I'm kind of confused why people can't just read the fact that it's time to move on and look at the future instead of the past.
<Sakuya> because most people hate change
<Sakuya> I do but I've gotten used to it
<Sakuya> Used to handling it
<Ascendant> derp
<Ascendant> <HyperMetalLugia> Lets make Sunny a mod and see what she does to the threads ;p
<Ascendant> hah
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder if she'll think counting to 1,000,000 is dangerous too...
<Ascendant> my #Silverwings logs are enormous
*HyperMetalLugia floofs up
<Ascendant> oh here we go
<Sakuya> Anyways
<Ascendant> "Makes me really sad that when a few members and myself are trying to save this forums from an evitable demise due to a topicas dangerous as this, you just send me a reply as poor as this, when you have enormous power in your hands that many would kill for, while you seat there and refuse to use them. "
*Ascendant lols
<Sakuya> At this poi-
<Sakuya> I laughed
<Ascendant> that's Sunny's PM
<Espeon> Lets move on from posting private messages now.
<Ascendant> or part of it
<HyperMetalLugia> Same
<Espeon> But it's still funny.
<Ascendant> okay fiiiiine
<Espeon> >>

<Sakuya> Anyways
*HyperMetalLugia kills DRF for server admin
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here..
<Sakuya> Lets go onto the next point
<HyperMetalLugia> What should that be?
<Sakuya> Its kinda obvious that people are ready
<Sakuya> And willing
<Sakuya> For a change
<Ascendant> Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> For once, I would think so
<Sakuya> So we might as well start on that
<HyperMetalLugia> Thing is, how'd we get it running out of the garage
<Ascendant> wat
*Ascendant throws sticks and stones at the chat
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad metaphor
<Ascendant> they'll come running out now
<Ascendant> /mauled
<Sakuya> You broke my bones
*HyperMetalLugia has no bones
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Ascendant> lmfao
<SheenaFox> lolol my brother turns 23 today

<HyperMetalLugia> But words will always hurt me ;(
<HyperMetalLugia> Old man
<Sakuya> Tell him he's old
<SheenaFox> I did
<SheenaFox> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Excellent!
<HyperMetalLugia> And we're getting off topic again?
<Sakuya> That's another thing
<Sakuya> .
<Sakuya> People go off topic
<SheenaFox> I'm sorry.
<Sakuya> Dont worry lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Don't worry
<Ascendant> let's not count how many times that's happened now
<Ascendant> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Brings activity
*HyperMetalLugia cultivated
<HyperMetalLugia> Erm, why is there another useless post there?
<Ascendant> heya drf
<HyperMetalLugia> WB DRF
<HyperMetalLugia> Warned me? or DRF? I hope is not me because outside of this circus, I consider myself to be overall pretty well-behaved
<HyperMetalLugia> and remember, I'm not talking only by myself, but a couple other users who have agreed with this topic being unnecessary and harmfu < Conspiracy
<Sakuya> ...
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03Stupid fundies
<drf|laptop> 03I swear
<HyperMetalLugia> Fundies ?
<drf|laptop> 03those people with the "I love Jesus" crap in their signatures
<Sakuya> It will not be pretty if I'm dragged onto the computer again
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol XD
<drf|laptop> 03makes me wanto to kick them for no good preason
<drf|laptop> 03-p
<Ascendant> ". I offered yesterday to Skylands to create them a forum at a free host so the ppl involved on this issue could bite themselves to death if they wanted to, and the rest that dont want to have a ping to do with this didnthave to deal with this"
<drf|laptop> 03especially because they tend to act all whiny as we can see from his postings :P
<Ascendant> lolol drf
<Ascendant> those
*HyperMetalLugia would say something, but he'd better not
<drf|laptop> 03see
<drf|laptop> 03i'm not even being mean
<Espeon> Until they start making threads about how not being a christian is bad I don't mind it at all.
<drf|laptop> 03it's kinda a well known thing
<Sakuya> what espeon said
<Ascendant> lol at Charizard El Latino's part of his post there lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Ascendant> "forum at a free host"
<Ascendant> lol
<drf|laptop> 03well when they have it in their signatures
<HyperMetalLugia> How
<drf|laptop> 03it's already rubbing it in your face
<Espeon> Uh, no.
<Espeon> They just say what THEY believe.
<Absol> drf, you have no idea what the meaning of "annoying signature" is
<Espeon> If it said "I believe in Jesus and will NOT go to hell because of that"
<Absol> just sayin'
<Espeon> then we're talking
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not saying it's an annoying signature
<Ascendant> lmfao Xeli
<drf|laptop> 03All I'm saying is the people who have signatures like "I'm a proud Christian" tend to be goodie-goodies and it pisses me off XD
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF.. pose as God and tell Ripred to stop being a noob </kill
<Espeon> drf
<drf|laptop> 03go say the words fundies to usotsuki and you'll see what's bad about them
*drf|laptop hides
<Espeon> It's your fault that you get offended!
<drf|laptop> 03er word fundie
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolwaht XD
*Espeon BA DUM TSCH
<drf|laptop> 03I never said I was offended
<drf|laptop> 03annoyed != offended
<Espeon> No but really, I just find it really odd xD
<Espeon> But we all have our pet peeves of sorts~
<Quilava> squeak.
<Ascendant> <Espeon> It's your fault that you get offended!
<Ascendant> lmfao
<HyperMetalLugia> Hah
<drf|laptop> 03well Espeon it's a lot worse in America, trust me
<drf|laptop> 03stupid Jehova's Witnesses and whatnot
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh joy
<Espeon> implying I don't know
<Espeon> I'm annoyed to the max by fundies too
<drf|laptop> 03I'll just say I'm glad we're not allowed to talk about religion on here
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Same
<drf|laptop> 03I'm just saying people like that are clearly fundies XJD
<drf|laptop> 03-J
<Espeon> but having "I love Jesus" in your sig is not the same as going from door to door and sticking your foot in it
<HyperMetalLugia> !define Fundies
<[TST]Bot> -!- Fundie or fundy (plural fundies) is a pejorative slang term used to refer to religious fundamentalists of any religion or denomination, although it is primarily directed towards fundamentalist Christians. ...
<Aizen> RRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWR!
<Ascendant> Jehova's Witnesses?
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm
<Armageddon> ;o
<Armageddon> heya
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah Ascendant
<Ascendant> ?
<HyperMetalLugia> I had a JW friend
<drf|laptop> 03Espeon, it's not only that, it's the whole "if you're not afraid to show it copy and paste this" thing
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm.. hard to explain
<Ascendant> I'M MEANT TO BE DOING MATHS HOMEWORK NOW NOT BEING ON IRC
<Ascendant> okay
<drf|laptop> 03that's just trying to spread it around which is what funldies do best
<drf|laptop> 03-,l
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm doing business homework
<Ascendant> I'm very tempted to reply to El Charizard Latino's post
<drf|laptop> 03s/reply/flame ?
<Ascendant> But it'd probably end up as some sort of mini-modding or whatnot
<Ascendant> reply, not flame
<drf|laptop> 03orl
<drf|laptop> 03y
<Espeon> Someone just has to say If you have nothing constructive to add to the thread, STAY SILENT
<Ascendant> something along the lines of "okay, stop this seriously, we're sick of it and we know what we're doing"
<Ascendant> well Xeli, there's been a number of times I've wanted to reply because I think someone/something is wrong/I don't agree but I've kept silent
<Ascendant> because it doesn't have much to do with the actual thread lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe
<Espeon> Then we're two.
<Espeon> Lol.
<Espeon> Or maybe seven
<Ascendant> xD

<Espeon> I never delete messages myself, but I seem to get little spam for some reason
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I get tons of spam, but I think that's in direct correlation to making my email address public
<drf|laptop> 03as in, it's a clickable link on my website
<drf|laptop> 03but Yahoo has beast spam filters so I don't even care

<Ascendant> Articuno posted that in the "What happened to the chat and pea pages?" topic
<Aurora> 6I'm going to speak with her about that
<Aurora> 6but first I also need to speak with kyu
<HyperMetalLugia> Fun

<Aurora> 6no
<Ascendant> ._.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, bad plan anyways...
<DeadCrab> chris have you gotten your running away from pissed off bulls badge yet?
<HyperMetalLugia> So, step 1 in action should be?
<Ascendant> bring the chat page back onto the site
<Ascendant> but we need Articuno to approve of it...
<Aurora> 6no
<Aurora> 6step 1 would be what the admins decide on
<HyperMetalLugia> Bring new users, get them excited and make new frien-
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah\
<Aurora> 6i'm sorry, but this is where we take over now
<Ascendant> Well true
<Aristeo> I got a couple of those, yeah
<Ascendant> but I think we should bring back the chat page first
<HyperMetalLugia> If Mr. Sleepants comes, then sure
<Ascendant> just a suggestion
<Aurora> 6continue posting suggestions in the topic if you want, but the first step is putting the admins and mods back in control
<Ascendant> yeah that seems to be something we're lacking atm XD
<Ascendant> control, really
<HyperMetalLugia> Indeed
<HyperMetalLugia> Later, redo of rules

<HyperMetalLugia> So guess XD
<Sparclam> haha, X11 isn't really… MAC
<Sniper> Error is a bot btw
<Sniper> My bot
<Sniper> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> But shell, I'm thinking of DLL
<Sparclam> hmm
<HyperMetalLugia> Goodness, those things
<Sparclam> explain DLL
<Sparclam> *define
<HyperMetalLugia> A DLL is Dynamic Link Library, most Windows thing
<Sparclam> …
<Sparclam> clarify, please? :D
<HyperMetalLugia> See, programs load Data from them to run like Direct X 10/9 DLL ( AKA. Graphics software)
<HyperMetalLugia> DLLs basicly are needed to help windows run/load extra things for them to use
<Sparclam> ah
<HyperMetalLugia> They can also be used for new features
<HyperMetalLugia> Like OpenSSL.DLL
<Sparclam> I meant "shell" as in the casing
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, but Windows Shell and Mac OS Shell are different
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll just use shell as in the windows/boxes for the programs
<Quilava> MMM.
<Sparclam> ah
<Sparclam> … the physical casing
<HyperMetalLugia> Not really physical, but it appears on the screen

<jasperbot> (with a "warning" sticker this big you know they gotta be fun!)
<Aurora> They did it D<
<HyperMetalLugia> That's what Luke Skywalker said before he nearly got run over by alderrann
<Aurora> I need to track this ost down now
<DarkTruth> >_>

<DarkTruth> can I beat someone up with them ?
<Aurora> well
<Chimera> 04[23:09:06] <&Aurora> They did it D< <-- who did what? :3
<nickstr> the only part I get any joy out of is the increasingly distant past
<Aurora> last year they released a "best of 1997-2010" soundtrack for the anime
<Aurora> but a lot of the music was stuff people aren't as familiar with
<HyperMetalLugia> Gotta buy/download them all it seems o.o
<Aurora> so they released volume 3
<Aurora> *2
<HyperMetalLugia> More hm o.o
<Aurora> with like all the songs from kanto
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow

<Absol> yes
<Sparclam||White> but I don't want to use him until the second pokémon
<Umbreon> 12ok
<eXAKR> DPP was the worst generation by far
<Chimera> 04nobody cares about the first gym
<Chimera> 04|D

<HyperMetalLugia> OLOL
<Sparclam||White> and that was tuesday
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad
<Sparclam||White> not monday
<Umbreon> 12of cards along with quanity
<Umbreon> 12and i want a cell that will add up everything that is in the quanity field
<Sparclam||White> which is trash day
<Sparclam||White> hence
*HyperMetalLugia throws DRAGONS at Sparky
<Sparclam||White> no, you did not pick it up
<Umbreon> 12so i know the total number of cards
*Sparclam||White throws them back with added RAEG
<Absol> is there a little button at the top
<Absol> that has the sigma symbol
<Absol> ?
*HyperMetalLugia loves DRAGONS + 1 RAEG
<Umbreon> 12not that i know of
*HyperMetalLugia gets a Happyness + 444
<Umbreon> 12doesn't matter
*Sparclam||White leaves
<Sparclam||White> bbl
<HyperMetalLugia> Seeyas
<Umbreon> 12i didn't want to use a spreadsheet because then i can't sort them but i don't really need to sort them
<Absol> i know in excel there are ways to sort them
*HyperMetalLugia finds a random dragon and uses it as a snuggle pillow .c.
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<Absol> also, make sure that it has the equals symbol
*eXAKR gives HyperMetalLugia a hawk to snuggle instead
<Umbreon> 12it does
<Absol> like "=SUM(blah:derp)"
<Aurora> 6Snivy, Swoobat, Zoroark, Sigilyph, scrafty, and chandelure is my team for most of the game I think
*HyperMetalLugia uses MATH and snuggles a gryphon insdead
<Light_Latias> uh
<Umbreon> 12it says the formula contains an error
<Light_Latias> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Un heya>
<Aurora> 6since I can't get my Deino until WAY later
<Absol> can you copy the formula?
<Aurora> 6and legendary is late too
<Chimera> 04.
<Absol> and show it to me
<HyperMetalLugia> I see
<Umbreon> 12=SUM(D1:D17)
<Absol> odd
<HyperMetalLugia> .o.
<Chimera> :E
<Absol> which version of excel are you using?
<Umbreon> 12i guess microsoft works just doesn't have it programmed in
<HyperMetalLugia> Want to snuggle my gryphon?
<Umbreon> 12it isn't excel
<Chimera> Also Roara thank you for telling me what moves to give my tean
<Sparclam||White> I've never seen a legendary
<Chimera> Team
*Chimera FLEE
<Sparclam||White> or a shiny
<Sparclam||White> or the Elite Four
<Absol> well, uh
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<Sparclam||White> wait, I have a shiny pichu
<HyperMetalLugia> You must of like..
<Sparclam||White> but that's it
<Umbreon> 12i had the theory though that they are alike and so that formulas that work in one would work in another
<HyperMetalLugia> Never got past Gym 1
<Sparclam||White> and I didn't catch that
<Umbreon> 12but i guess they aren't that close together
<Absol> i don't see why microsoft would change it that much

<Chimera> Ah
<Chimera> It's not a hack
<Chimera> It's an RPGMaker executable
<Aurora> 6it's not-
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Chimera> Hm... I wonder how that'll work out
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice
<Chimera> I mean, I played some kid's RPGMaker version of Pokemon Silver before SS came out
<Chimera> It... Sucked.
<Chimera> :c
<Chimera> Hope this doesn't :3

<Umbreon> 12:<
<Aurora> 6also, <3 catch effects
<Chimera> Pretty well done effects indeed :)
<Chimera> But I do have one complaint...
<HyperMetalLugia> What?
<Chimera> The speed is kind of... Sluggish on some parts
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6that's ane xtremely old video though
<Aurora> 6from early last year
<Chimera> Hope they sped it up
<Aurora> 6if you look at the newer ones, it's more refined
<Aurora> 6since it's still WIP
<Chimera> Got a more reacent gameplay footage?
<Chimera> K
<Chimera> I really have high hopes for this thing :o
<Chimera> Did you beg them to put in Steven yet
*Chimera runs
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Aurora> 6I have high hopes
<Aurora> 6since all 4 japan regions + 1 custom are being added
<HyperMetalLugia> No steven plz ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh nice~
*Aurora 6punts HML
<Chimera> Yeah
*HyperMetalLugia eehs
<Chimera> Rofl
<Chimera> I was gonna type that Roara :P
<Chimera> But k
<Chimera> Also hm
<HyperMetalLugia> You're not starlit
<Chimera> I wonder what the new one's gonna look like
<Chimera> Or where it's located
<Chimera> Since most "hacks" are areas based off NOTHING
<Chimera> or edited versions of other regions with is :c
<Chimera> This guy seems to know what he's doing though
<Aurora> 6he's got a team there, and it's nice seeing they're about halfway done
<Chimera> It'd be cool if his new region was northern Japan and the Sinjoh ruins were accessable (even though they're closed off)
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Chimera> But seriously
<Chimera> Pokemon is NOT INVOLVED with the upper mainland of Japan AT ALL |D
<Chimera> Is it really that boreing? *flees*
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6Oblivia, Almia, and Sinnoh are north japan
<Chimera> Sinnoh is its own island
<Aurora> 6but if you mean the north/west shore, then yeah it's not been used there
<Chimera> I meant mainland
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6the north island
<Aurora> 6oh
<Aurora> 6almia and oblivia are technically mainland I believe
<Aurora> 6the northern tip
<Chimera> Oblivia and Almia are north though yeah
<Chimera> Yup
<DeadCrab> lol i'm fighting with little jenny over a doughnut
<Chimera> ...Where the heck is Fiorre though? :V
<Chimera> (sp?)
<DeadCrab> i'm gonna solve this argument with a knife
<Aurora> 6um
<DeadCrab> and you can relax i'm not about to cut her. i'm gonna cut the doughnut in half
<Aurora> 6I had this all mapped out
<Aurora> 6in one of my 100+ sketchbooks
<Umbreon> 12sigh

<Chimera> Bree~
<Chimera> LL hi
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Aurora> 6I believe I wound up mapping fiore on the southwest
<Chimera> Oh?
<Chimera> That's farther from Almia and Oblivia by a longshot :P
<Chimera> Also, one thing I don't like about newer Pokémon games is that, even thoughthey're basing the regions off of real places which is awesome, they're making animals less and less known
<Chimera> The only living ones, IIRC, were a cat in concept art and a dog on the cover of a book in Season 1
<nickstr> that has ALWAYS been done
<Chimera> Yeah
<nickstr> the very first region was based upon an actual area in Japan
<nickstr> same can be said with up to Shinoh
<Chimera> But there's almost no implications of animals anymore :E
<nickstr> Isshu is the first to not be based on Japan
<junh1024-XD> so nickstr` & drf|away , i sent your packages
<Chimera> What, do you eat Pokémon now?
*Chimera runs
<Chimera> That's
<Chimera> *That'd be sad tho :x
<junh1024-XD> 4-10 working days
<Aurora> 6I think I mapped fiorre in the kinki region
<Aurora> 6whch is south
*HyperMetalLugia loled at the old hack video series he used to watch
<Chimera> Connection fffffs :c
<HyperMetalLugia> But.. there was one particular one I can't seem to remember/find
<Aurora> 6I think I mapped fiorre in the kinki region
<Aurora> 6whch is south
<Chimera> Heh
<Aurora> 6http://www.t.soka.ac.jp/chem/CEJ2/JapanMapII.GIF
<nickstr> the Johto Journeys box set will have some redundancies
<nickstr> as it contains Orange Islands episodes
<Aurora> 6kanto is kanto
<Aurora> 6obvious
<nickstr> one of the redundancies in terms of episodes is a favorite of mine though
<Aurora> 6johto is chubu
<Chimera> Ahahaha
<Chimera> In Blue Chrome
<Aurora> 6although, orre is on the west edge of chubu
<Chimera> You can wear Red's outfit
<Chimera> XD
<Chimera> ...Or does that change your "skin
<Chimera> ?"
<Aurora> 6wait
<Aurora> 6nvm
<Chimera> Like, you turn into Red if you wear that outfit
<Aurora> 6I think orre was in chugoku
<Chimera> And Gold/Ethan if you wear his
<Aurora> 6technically, it changes the sprite, but the idea is just the outfit changes

<nickstr> 77 degrees for me is perfect
<Ascendant> I'm used to celsius
<Ascendant> not fahrenheit xD
<Iskierka> if by python dies you're complaining about how it flops quite readily, use try: except: statements on anything liable to fail
<Iskierka> ex. with a file-open command try: <open the file and do stuff with it> except (list of potential errors) as error: <error report using variable 'error' as the error statement>
<Ascendant> XD
<Aurora> Bed
<Aurora> Zzz
<Ascendant> true
<Ascendant> seeya Aurora
<Ascendant> Python can be fickle though
<Ascendant> but C and C++ are worse...especially C++
<Iskierka> I've also learned always do "with var as open(file):" blocks rather than the normal method of accessing files, as the normal way won't release the file if it crashes while it's open.
<Iskierka> python is delicate but there's ways around where it breaks down
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> C++ makes me rage
<Ascendant> python on the other hand doesn't
<Ascendant> which is at least something I can give credit to it for
<Armageddon> bbl piano
<Ascendant> bbl piano
<Iskierka> python is being very successful at making me rage at the moment.

<nickstr> I discovered a weirdness with the 7809 voltage regulator
<nickstr> it seems when you have its output going into a 7805 it causes instability to programmable oscilators
<nickstr> the issue caused a wavering effect in the carrier on the AM transmitter and also resulted in the 25 Hz stereo pilot tone fluctuating a bit

<Creideiki> Woot... I've finally and completely deWindozed a 122-key UNICOMP keyboard.
<Creideiki> And it costs absolutely nothing (to the price of the keyboard).
<Umbreon> 12attention customers, Umbreon says hi to whoever is here
<TR_Reed> 14hello there

<HyperSickLugia> lol
<Creideiki> Okay... I'm mildly bored before chem lab so...
<Creideiki> For any one interested in playing with some really easy to get running retrocomputing stuff: http://upload.cetafurs.com/adss-km.zip
<HyperSickLugia> Okay o.o
<Creideiki> I've made a very simple (and dumbed down) distribution of the Advanced Software System/Keyboard Monitor for the PDP-9.
<Creideiki> Unpack... and just start the exe... on windows as I put some batch into the auto booting INI.
<HyperSickLugia> How'd you backspace in the window XD
<HyperSickLugia> And what commands are there?
<HyperSickLugia> Ah
<HyperSickLugia> Heya Rora
<Umbreon> 12hi
<Sakuya> Vanilla ice cream and peanut butter is legit stuff
<Umbreon> 12too much fat
<Sakuya> Perhaps
<Sakuya> Still good though
<Creideiki> An easier way to keep the "help" text on screen is to add the line "SET CONSOLE TELNET {port number}" into the pdp9.ini file somewhere before the RUN statement. Then connect with hyperterm or something.
<Umbreon> 12Sakuya
<Umbreon> 12a weird trait about me is that anything that is high in fat usually tastes awful to me
<Umbreon> 12i hate bacon for starters XD
<Sakuya> Sometimes I wish that was me
<Umbreon> 12i remember having that KFC double down sandwich
<Umbreon> 12that tasted awful as well XD
<Sakuya> Ok well
<Sakuya> Stuff like kfc that's basically downing in fat
<Sakuya> Tastes gross
<Sakuya> I still eat though lol
<Umbreon> 12lol
<HyperSickLugia> One weird system here Creideiki
<HyperSickLugia> It would be easier to use if I could even backspace and edit XD
<Creideiki> Delete equals backspace... sort of.
<Iskierka> delete is backbackspace
*Iskierka cough
<Creideiki> The thing is that the PDP-9 wasn't built for video terms so the RUB OUT key on the teletype sent out the ASCII delete code, which was interpreted as "delete the last letter."
<Creideiki> So if you made a tipo\\\ypo your lines of kode\\\\code would start ooking\\\\\\looking like this.
<Creideiki> But yes... I must go. Time for SCIENCE!
<Creideiki> (Also known as a chemistry lab.)
<HyperSickLugia> YES!
<HyperSickLugia> Baaisz
<HyperSickLugia> LOL I typed RBU\\ and it got a device listing by mistake
<HyperSickLugia> and hah, delete -= s on there
*Quilava rolls on the floor
<Ascendant> ;o
<Espeon> Oh
<Espeon> Hi
<Espeon> ~~~~~~~~~~~~¨

<Ascendant> ;o
*lightumbreon yawns
*Ascendant lols
<Ascendant> oh this is funny
<Ascendant> someone reported my post as silly
<Ascendant> albeit it sort of was
<Ascendant> but that is actually really funny
<lightumbreon> oh, i heard he did that with more posts from other users
<Sakuya> Its more of just not knowing
<Sakuya> yeah that person is not native english
<Ascendant> Yeah I know
<Ascendant> I wasn't really trying to make fun of him lol
<Sakuya> I know, but don't be making fun if the report either
<Sakuya> Of
<Ascendant> Okay
<Chimera> 04http://www.serebii.net/potw-bw/497.shtml
<Ascendant> gaaaaah
<Chimera> 04HOLY
<Ascendant> I feel like killing my internet connection
<Quilava> tongs :(
<Ascendant> cbf to load it, what is it? o.o
<Chimera> 04Perversity <3
<Espeon> Serperior
<Espeon> wait what is this
<Espeon> Oh wait, english names or something.
<Chimera> 04Serperior is officially the best starter
<Espeon> Not like that means much.
<Espeon> I mean
<Espeon> YAY
<Ascendant> oh Serperior is a starter? /fail
<Espeon> It's Jaroda
<Espeon> Or whatever Smugleaf's final evo is.
<Espeon> I can accept tsutarja, but calling it snivy is a crime
<Sakuya> What exactly does pervetsity do
<Chimera> 04Moves used on the Pokémon that raise stats lower the stats, while the moves that lower the stats raise the stat
<Espeon> Oh wow.
<Sakuya> ....lol wow
<Chimera> 04The only thing I can see that blowing up is with Swagger
<Chimera> 04Because then you're actually confused AND weaker
<Chimera> 04Everything else though is pwn
<Ascendant> Ah
<Sakuya> Too bad that's gonna be dream world stuff
<Chimera> 04true
<Chimera> 04But
<Ascendant> /no idea of 5th gen
<Sakuya> So technically it doesn't exist
<Espeon> What she said :3
<Chimera> 04When he's released in the dream world, you'll be able to get a freaking tank
<Chimera> 04It doesn't exist
<Chimera> 04YET :P
<Sakuya> Yeah
<Sakuya> But theres a couple hundred other pokemon with dream world abilities
<Sakuya> We'll see
<HML-Sick> thongs?
<Sakuya> Also fail at the dream world
<HyperSickLugia> hmmmm
<Sakuya> Because of the server crash at japan bw release
<Sakuya> We wont have dream worldfor a long while
<HyperSickLugia> Faailss
<HyperSickLugia> ;.;
<Sakuya> But whatever
<SpyroD> same as yesterday, only you
<Sakuya> I'll be to busy with the rest of the game anyways
<Ascendant> crap I need to update my PO client >.<

<Sakuya> ...the game, lost it
<Ascendant> aww
<Ascendant> damnit
<Ascendant> heya TR_Reed
<Chimera> 04hahaha
<Chimera> 04you failed yourself Sakuya |3
<Chimera> 04anyway
<Chimera> 04Sakuya, the server crash happened because EVERY FREAKING JAPANESE KID/TEEN/CREEPYADULT LOGGED ON
*Chimera runs
<Chimera> 04Pokémon is apparently HUGE in Japan
<Sakuya> And what do you think will happen here lol
<Chimera> 04it's not as big
<HyperSickLugia> XD
<Sakuya> have you seen the preorder sales?!
<Chimera> 04Besides, they'll hopefully up their servers knowing what happened first
<Aristeo> Internet could go out at any moment!
<Chimera> 04Compare the preorder sales of BW in the US to Europe and Japan
<Chimera> 04Who has the most?
<Chimera> 04erm, had
<Chimera> 04I bet you anything Japan had more
<Armageddon> ;o
<Armageddon> Xeli
<Quilava> nu, tongs
<Armageddon> Pokemon Online
<Sakuya> Perhaps
<Armageddon> need to learn
<Armageddon> about patches
*Quilava also hugs on HML
<Armageddon> -.-
*HML-Sick hugs on Quilava
<Sakuya> But our sales will be more than enough to overload the system again
<HML-Sick> I'm not too bad, he
<HML-Sick> *heh
<Chimera> 04Nintendo'll probably have a more reinforced server to handle another wave of logins at the time of the US/EU release
<Sakuya> Especially if these are all running on the same system
<Chimera> 04And since Japan had more orders/sales, I can assume the Dream World is going to be safer here
<Sakuya> Since yeah, both US and UK
<Quilava> mm, still, get well soon
<lightumbreon> did you know that the EU release is two days earlier than the US one?
<Sakuya> Chimera
<Chimera> 04well true
<Chimera> 04But
<Sakuya> You need to consider
<Chimera> 04since the UK's getting it first..
<Sakuya> The population
<Sakuya> Japan is anal
<Chimera> 04They'll have everyone log in immediately
<Sakuya> ...small
<Sakuya> O.o
<Chimera> 04and then-
<Chimera> 04.
<Ascendant> o_O
<Chimera> 04WHAT
<Ascendant> wat
<Chimera> 04WHAT TYPO IS THAT ROFL
<Ascendant> wat
<Espeon> How did you manage that.
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Sakuya> Il burn my phone now
<Ascendant> xD
<Chimera> 04XD
<Ascendant> XD
<Sakuya> Its a swype type
<Ascendant> hah
<Sakuya> Its easy to typo things
<Chimera> 04[14:30:29] <&Sakuya> Japan is anal <-- I must pea this
*Chimera RUNS
<Ascendant> derp
<Sakuya> That was horrible
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> why is that not in the badwords lol
<Ascendant> well
<Sakuya> Ill switch to keyboard
<Ascendant> doesn't have to be but lol
<Chimera> 04because anal retentive is a term
<Chimera> 04:P
<Ascendant> true
<HyperSickLugia> LOL
<Chimera> 04And yes I know Japan's small. However, they have more people in small areas.
<Sakuya> But yeah, japan is a fraction of the US population
<Chimera> 04It is?
<Chimera> 04Really?
<Sakuya> I want to compare the sales
<Chimera> 04I thought it was more o.o
<Sakuya> ...
<Sakuya> Absolutelynot lol
<Chimera> 04yes I know
<Chimera> 04small island
<Sakuya> The US has like 300 million
<Chimera> 04But IIRC, most of Asia is populated in many areas
<Espeon> so 127 million is a "fraction" of 300 million?
<Espeon> Lol wut
<Espeon> Population, that is.
<Sakuya> fraction means a piece....
<Sakuya> Like, less than?
<Espeon> Well sure, but usually you hear it used when it's like smaller =P
<Sakuya> Lol
<Sakuya> Well
<Sakuya> That is less than half
<Sakuya> Also
<Sakuya> I think I'm horribly wrong about US pop

<drf|laptop> 03also meh
<drf|laptop> 03I need to cancel
<drf|laptop> 03er
<HyperSickLugia> Maybe your mind is trying to tell you to love gen 5 .
<drf|laptop> 03I need to cancel my BW preorder at Amazon and re-preorder
<drf|laptop> 03because
<HyperSickLugia> Why?
<Sakuya> Why is this taking so long to fund
<Sakuya> Find
<drf|laptop> 03now, if you preorder, you get a $10 Amazon gift card
<Sakuya> Djxfn
<drf|laptop> 03so I can get each game for $25
<drf|laptop> 03rather than $35
<HyperSickLugia> nice
<Sakuya> And looks like game stop will be the failure this time
<drf|laptop> 03EW GAMESTOP
<Sakuya> its the one place without a bonus
<drf|laptop> 03I refuse to set foot in that place unless absolutely need be
<drf|laptop> 03why not just use Amazon?
<drf|laptop> 03You get release date deliery
<Sakuya> Except the wall clings, but that's sioux
<Sakuya> ..stupid
<drf|laptop> 03so you get it at your door when it comes out :P
<Sakuya> Stupid phone
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 sioux phone
<Sakuya> Lol
<EpicStatsGuy> :з / :З / :3 / :³ / є: / E: / :Э / Є: / :э
<Quilava> hi Sneas
<Sakuya> I'm semi tempted to cancel my preorder with gamestop, but at this point its not worth it
<drf|laptop> 03I'd say do it
<drf|laptop> 03you can get each game for $25 on Amazon
<drf|laptop> 03which is totally a better deal than Gamestop
<drf|laptop> 03plus no tax
<drf|laptop> 03free shipping etc
<drf|laptop> 03LL gets annoyed at me telling her to buy online too much, I'm gonna do that to the rest of you too :D
*drf|laptop hides
<Sakuya> too bad theres no post on sunday lol
<drf|laptop> 03true
<drf|laptop> 03you'd get it on Monday
<lightumbreon> is it still sunday over there?
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03we're talking about when Black and white come out
<lightumbreon> oh, right, time zone mashup
<drf|laptop> 03though you know
<Sneas> Hi
<drf|laptop> 03I will seriously laugh
<drf|laptop> 03if I get my BW's on Saturday
<drf|laptop> 03it's happened plenty of times before
<Sakuya> Lol
<drf|laptop> 03they use UPS 2 day shipping so they ship it 2 days before release date
<drf|laptop> 03but UPS decides to be nice and delivers it after 1
<Sakuya> I wish I had my reciept, id cancel today
<Armageddon> :3
<drf|laptop> 03of course, I won't be back at my dorm until Sunday anyway so it's pointless

<PandaFlower> yay the fleet is issuing a new type of missile ^-^
<nickstr> no
<nickstr> there is a radio edit
<nickstr> censored
<drf|laptop> 03what's censored
<drf|laptop> 03?
<drf|laptop> 03the version I have from NOW 6 just plays the word backwards x.x
<drf|laptop> 03which is stupid
<Jason> :O
<Jason> Who are you
<nickstr> g**da*n nights and getting h***
<Jason> ?
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, the one I have just plays godd*** backwards
<PandaFlower> one of grimm's gaming friends
<drf|laptop> 03but it sounds dumb
<drf|laptop> 03the one you have actually mutes it?
<nickstr> yes
<drf|laptop> 03:O
<drf|laptop> 03Can you upload that for me?
*PandaFlower points at deadcrab
<nickstr> I suppose so
<drf|laptop> 03www.sendspace.com
<nickstr> don't want to make an account
<drf|laptop> 03given the bitrate, I'm guessing you ripped that yourself?>
<drf|laptop> 03you don't need to
<drf|laptop> 03just hit upload o.o
<nickstr> I did
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<nickstr> it was direct from the music video
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03wait where'd you get the music video?
<drf|laptop> 03I didn't even know there was one
<nickstr> Youtube
<nickstr> it was an HD version
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<nickstr> with AAC+ audio
<drf|laptop> 03just give me the YT link then
<drf|laptop> 03I can extract the audio myself
<PandaFlower> i wonder if he knows we're getting new ordinance. he hasn't logged into freespace yet today
<nickstr> I can't remember it
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03the VEVO one only does 480p
<drf|laptop> 03ah I hear the "god" part muted
<drf|laptop> 03kinda lame still but :/
<nickstr> I suppose
*nickstr np: Mayumi Iizuka - Rapurasu Ni Notte (TV Anime [Poketto Monsutaa] Endingu Teema Songu) [03:50m/320kbps/44kHz]
<drf|laptop> 03does yours mute the whole word or just "god"?
<nickstr> I would have to play it again
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03whatever
<drf|laptop> 03can you just upload it for me?
<nickstr> but you see the thing is the neighbors might be able to hear it if any of them listen to AM and tune up and down the bad
<nickstr> *band
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<PandaFlower> the new missile has a 3million km increase in effective range ^-^

<drf|laptop> 03LOL 9V battery
<nickstr> not anymore
<nickstr> I have a 12 volt battery pack
<nickstr> but am back to using a crystal for frequency control
<nickstr> but the perk is the higher power add on works now and the range is about a quarter mile
<PandaFlower> idk if they improved the laser warhead or not yet but more range is better
<Skylands> 10oh bullcrap >>
<PandaFlower> even if they didn't improve the warhead i'm happy with my new toys ^-^
<nickstr> if I had a better receiver I would record the on air stereo signal

<drf|laptop> 03Shadow_Lugia, no
<HyperSickLugia> it does work
<HyperSickLugia> Amazing
<drf|laptop> 03System restore does absolutely nothing against viruses
<HyperSickLugia> Bad idea SL
<Skylands> 10Yeah
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Does for me.
<Nick> system restore probably wont work cos the malware will most likely embedded itself in that particular section or whatever the term is
<drf|laptop> 03did it pop up a command prompt, Skylands?
<HyperSickLugia> Well then, you're luck
<Skylands> 10Where do I type /run cmd.exe?
<HyperSickLugia> ......
<Nick> its what malware coders do first is to infect the system restore
*Skylands barely knows computers
<drf|laptop> 03same place you'd type /me whatever

<HyperSickLugia> SO malwarebytes
<Espeon> whoa, it blocks cmd.exe?
<Skylands> 10All because I went on Bulbapedia
<drf|laptop> 03it probably was something else
<drf|laptop> 03be like me and blame Apple
*drf|laptop hides
*Skylands sighs
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Espeon> Then I guess the malware remover things are on lockdown so =<
<Creideiki> Well... an idea.
<PandaFlower> ooh we're getting an improved version of the screamer ecm missile
<drf|laptop> 03my sisters had a very similar problem
<drf|laptop> 03we had to reformat
<Nick> you got it off bulbapedia?
<Creideiki> If cmd is being blocked...
<Creideiki> Why not try the older more aging one...
<drf|laptop> 03Creideiki, it blocks everything
<Skylands> 10Idk, Nick
<Creideiki> COMMAND.COM
<Skylands> 10but that's when it popped up
<HyperSickLugia> O.o
<Nick> hmm
<drf|laptop> 03* /run: unable to open 'command.com'
<HyperSickLugia> Maybe?
<Skylands> 10when I was viewing a page on Bulbapedia
<drf|laptop> 03then again
<drf|laptop> 03doesn't exist in Windows 7
<HyperSickLugia> Yeah
<Creideiki> Oh.
<HyperSickLugia> Sadly
<Espeon> I had one I got away by downloading a removal toolkit but I've heard the newer ones block virtually everything so =s
*Skylands uses Windows XP
<Skylands> 10and that did nothing
<HyperSickLugia> Good
<HyperSickLugia> ah
<HyperSickLugia> Well
<Creideiki> Win7 killed th 16-bit stuff so there's no way to get COMMAND.COM on it then.
<Creideiki> (XP has it though. :P

<drf|laptop> 03actually no
<drf|laptop> 03it's only Windows 7 x64

<Creideiki> There is always a way to fix a virus problem.
<HyperSickLugia> Ah :|
<Jason> Andres: he hippie, i saw a pic of you, yer right, you dont look so hippie-like anymore
<PandaFlower> eek i'm not a boy
<Nick> most browsers has some form of protection nowadays
<drf|laptop> 03Creideiki, reformatting? :P
<Creideiki> It's called reinstalling Windows.
<HyperSickLugia> You should of gotten malwareytes .x.
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Jason> she*
<Jason> :
<drf|laptop> 03OK so
<Skylands> 10The bad thing is
<Jason> :O
<drf|laptop> 03Skylands, here's what you can do then
*Jason stares into PandaFlower's eyes
*PandaFlower tazes jason and sprays him with maCe
<Skylands> 10my dad won't fix it
<drf|laptop> 03Reboot, press F8 when it's starting up
<Skylands> 10after the last time he quit
<drf|laptop> 03screw your dad, I prolly know more than him
*drf|laptop hides
<Creideiki> I just use Avast! becuase it's free... and all you've gotta do is just renew your free license each year.
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<HyperSickLugia> Safemode :|
<drf|laptop> 03no but see
<drf|laptop> 03not JUST safe mode
<Andres> You are about the same age so Panda's flirting is acceptable.
<drf|laptop> 03Safe Mode With Networking
<Skylands> 10reebot internet?
<drf|laptop> 03that will let you get online
<HyperSickLugia> Witrh networkng
<HyperSickLugia> Yea'
<drf|laptop> 03no
<HyperSickLugia> No
<drf|laptop> 03rebooting Internet doesn't do anything
<HyperSickLugia> PC
<HyperSickLugia> Box
<Andres> http://myfoodlooksfunny.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/funny-food-photos-tot-sized-pizza.jpg Woah.
<drf|laptop> 03Skylands, reboot your PC, select Safe Mode With Networking
<Nick> reset the OS he means
<HyperSickLugia> like shutdown and F8
<drf|laptop> 03that should let you load mIRC and stuff
<drf|laptop> 03but
<Nick> or safe mode yeah
<HyperSickLugia> Down arrow .c.
<drf|laptop> 03you should then be able to run Firefox
<drf|laptop> 03and download/instlal Malwarebytes
<Skylands> 10dunno where to locate the select safe mode or w/e
<drf|laptop> 03run that
<drf|laptop> 03F8
<Creideiki> F8 on bootup.
<PandaFlower> i want it!! it looks so yummy ^-^
<drf|laptop> 03reboot and just keep pressing F8 until the menu comes up
<Jason> :O
<HyperSickLugia> A small menu
<Creideiki> Before the Winlogo.
<HyperSickLugia> Or before the BIOS
<Jason> How old are ya PandaFlower
<HyperSickLugia> Finishe
<HyperSickLugia> *Finishes
<drf|laptop> 03no, not before the bios
<drf|laptop> 03that'll just cause keyboard errors
<HyperSickLugia> Ah
*PandaFlower checks the calender
<Creideiki> After POST is complete, and the disk drives are recog'd.
<PandaFlower> still 15 for a few days
<HyperSickLugia> It'll black out for a sec
<Creideiki> Then when it's listing the I/O ports - i.e. stage 1 bootloader - you can star stabbing the F8.
<Jason> :O
*Jason is 14
<HyperSickLugia> Fail
<HyperSickLugia> XD
<Andres> Oh, Jason is younger than I remember.
<Andres> Mace away!
<Jason> :O
<HyperSickLugia> It isn't too hard skylands .o.
*Aristeo thinks Jason + PandaFlower
<Nick> btw sky is this program prompting you to buy a subscription in order to use it?
<PandaFlower> =p i'm still older
<Creideiki> Okay... killed the wrong application there.
*Jason thinks Aristeo + the dumpster
*Andres yawns slightly.
<Aristeo> :(
<drf|laptop> 03Nick, I know the virus, my sisters had it
<Skylands> 10Nick, is just says to "scan" it
<Jason> jokes
<HyperSickLugia> Same
<drf|laptop> 03it's really hard to get rid of
<HyperSickLugia> My mother's PC had it
<drf|laptop> 03Malwarebytes will work... IF you're able to run it
*PandaFlower feeds andres more robot food
<HyperSickLugia> I got rid of it since I had MB and safemode+ Net
<drf|laptop> 03the best way is to rename mbam.exe to something else
<Jason> you know youll kidnap someone some day <3
<drf|laptop> 03actually
<drf|laptop> 03you know another way that works?
<drf|laptop> 03make a new Windows user account.
*Andres thinks Andres + [EnterNameHere]
<drf|laptop> 03then install Malwarebytes on that
<drf|laptop> 03XD
*Jason pours Gosonline on Andres
<drf|laptop> 03It sounds dumb but it works
<HyperSickLugia> LOLwhat X
<HyperSickLugia> oh
*Jason lights a cig
<Nick> so its not the kind of fake AV that forces you to pay money to 'use' it
<Andres> Yay booze and gasoline!
<Nick> ?
*Andres drinks both!
<HyperSickLugia> You know what'sm dumber?>
*Jason lights a spark
<HyperSickLugia> I installed a Windows 7 partition JUST to do that XD
<Jason> PandaFlower: where you from?
<PandaFlower> seattle
<Skylands> 10LOL
<Skylands> 10"34 threats have been found"
<Skylands> 1034
<Jason> Ah
<Jason> so is Stitch
<HyperSickLugia> LOL
<HyperSickLugia> Fail
<Jason> but he is barely here
<Espeon> Together they are even more terrifying
<Skylands> 10[16:35] <Chimera> I wonder if its downloading porn
<HyperSickLugia> XD
<HyperSickLugia> Yes!
<Skylands> 10Meh
<Skylands> 10If I'm unable to get back on, expect to see me using an iPod Touch app known as irchon and stuff
*Jason pushes PandaFlower into #chatshack
<HyperSickLugia> Okay
<drf|laptop> 03just reboot into safe Mode With Networking
<drf|laptop> 03that's all you need to know
<HyperSickLugia> But you should do that first..
<Jason> PandaFlower: you smoke?
<HyperSickLugia> I bet she'll forget :|
<HyperSickLugia> o.o
<PandaFlower> i accidentally closed the tab
<Creideiki> X-Chat is starting to act twatty...
<HyperSickLugia> Yesh
<Jason> PandaFlower: you smoke
<Jason> ?
<Jason> do*
<drf|laptop> 03bbl
<PandaFlower> yeah i do
<Jason> :O
*Jason loves smokers
<Jason> they are the future :)
<nickstr> yikes
<PandaFlower> lol ^-^
<HyperSickLugia> o.o
<Jason> u.u. i cant get any here though
<Jason> stupid Canada
<Creideiki> Okay, I think it might co-operate now.
<Jason> who
<Jason> whoa3*
<PandaFlower> andres still hungry?
<Jason> andres always hungy ;)
<Creideiki> Seems to be working correctly now.
<Jason> hungry*
*PandaFlower gets more robot food
*PandaFlower feeds andres plasma ^-^
<Jason> :O
*Jason wants some
<Andres> Actually, I only eat once per day and I have already eaten like 10 hours ago D:

<Jason> lol
<Jason> hey jasperdett|laptop
<Jason> hey jasperdett
<Jason> hey jasperbot
<Jason> hey Andres
<jasperdett> hi
*Jason stabs all the Canadians here
*Jason moves to the US and stands beside panda*
<Jason> PandaFlower: **
<PandaFlower> D: deadcrab's gf is canadian and she's really sweet
<Skylands> so I'm in safe mode
<Jason> :O
<Armageddon> o-O
<Skylands> now what, drf?
<Creideiki> Welcome back.
<PandaFlower> he got me to go intov her channel
<Jason> if yer really sweet yer bf can be canadian ;)
<Jason> Jokes
<Quilava> porn
<Creideiki> One could try the blindingly obvious plan of attack:
<Armageddon> ohai Quilava xD
*Jason eats all the awkwardness
*Jason also eats Aristeo
<Quilava> hi
<Armageddon> How are you?
<Creideiki> Do you have a REAL antivirus (that's not Norton)?
<Quilava> kinda meh
<HyperSickLugia> Maayve
<Skylands> no
<HyperSickLugia> Ah
<HyperSickLugia> WB Skylands
<Armageddon> >:
<Skylands> I dont have any lol
<HyperSickLugia> Download malwarebytes
<Skylands> because the ones I did have were all BS
<Creideiki> Okay... THAT'S the source of your problems.
<HyperSickLugia> Want a direct link?
<Nick> and avg free
<HML-Sick> ;(
<HyperSickLugia> Avg is bleh
<Ascendant> Chimera
<Skylands> no HML
<Ascendant> I have a solution
<Skylands> I'm using iPod
<Ascendant> Stop using windows
<Creideiki> So the plan now: Open browser, go to google, get malwarebytes
<Nick> certain programs could not be picked up by AVG without malware bytes and vice versa in my experience
<HyperSickLugia> That's so solution
<Ascendant> Skylands*
<Jason> BLAH BLAH BLAH
<HyperSickLugia> Only real one is to stop clicking every link ;P
<Creideiki> And then GET A BLOODY ANTIVIRUS! (May I suggest Avast! ?)
<Ascendant> Skylands, live boot into say, Ubuntu
<Ascendant> Retrieve your files
<Skylands> no Internet connection
<Ascendant> wipe windows
<HyperSickLugia> She can't download it lol
<Ascendant> put linux on
<Ascendant> :{D
<Ascendant> go buy one then
<HyperSickLugia> Nah
*Soyuz pokes Armageddon
<Ascendant> it's like $5
<HyperSickLugia> Ew
<Ascendant> heya SilverSonic
<HyperSickLugia> Go just try to fix windows
<Espeon> Ascendant, try to help instead of preaching or stfu :3
<nickstr> problem is with Linux you are shut out of around 99% of mainstream productivity applications
<HyperSickLugia> :Like 90% of her old stuff won't work on bawnixz
<Skylands> ...
<Ascendant> I'm not preaching lol
<nickstr> plus the support for devices sucks
<Skylands> so I guess I'm screwed
<HyperSickLugia> Yes
<HyperSickLugia> Well, possibly
<Ascendant> Well Skylands
<Ascendant> Do you know what virus you have?
<Espeon> HAhahaaha.
<Skylands> I told drf earlier
<Creideiki> Okay, so if everyone is done with the Linuxrage... can we get back to trying to help?
<Espeon> and it's AntiMalware Go
<Skylands> can't remember the name
<Chimera> 04heh
<Skylands> yeh
<Aristeo> :o
<Chimera> 04drf's here
<Chimera> 04erm
<Aristeo> Wow, it looks awkward in here
<Chimera> 04no
<Chimera> 04frack
<Skylands> also yes what Credeki said
<Chimera> 04D:
<HyperSickLugia> There are some bad mac viruses now ;O
<Aristeo> I'm gonna leave you alone now xD
<Creideiki> Skylands: So you can't get to any websites at all?
<Ascendant> >scrolling up
*PandaFlower sings and watches the whole channel die
<Ascendant> >CGI:IRC
<Ascendant> >no
<Skylands> no
<Chimera> 04wow
<Chimera> 04That sucks
<Chimera> 04x_x
<Chimera> 04The virus is doing that?
<Creideiki> Query: Does any one know if mIRC supports DCC?
<Skylands> hm
<HyperSickLugia> Skylands.. can you try msconfig?
<HyperSickLugia> Yeah
<Ascendant> Yes it does Creideiki
<Jason> the channel was dead ever since Aristeo joined it
<Ascendant> Most clients support DCC
<HyperSickLugia> Just glitchy for some servers
<Chimera> 04Wait
<Jason> :)
<Chimera> 04Skylands
<HyperSickLugia> *clients
<Ascendant> Well, proper IRC clients
<Skylands> wat HML
<Chimera> 04You can connect via IRC?
<Chimera> 04WHat?
<Jason> and there is the payback ^
<Skylands> I no speak computers
<Ascendant> Skylands is on her ipod
<Ascendant> iirc
<Skylands> XD
<Chimera> 04bit
<Chimera> 04*but
<Chimera> 04she was on mIRC moments ago
<Skylands> yeh NS
<Aristeo> xD
<Aristeo> <3
<HyperSickLugia> Can you use run
*Armageddon pokes back
<Aristeo> I think Jason and PandaFlower would make a nice couple
<Skylands> let's see
<Skylands> yes
<HyperSickLugia> like type /run msconfig.exe
<Jason> i think Aristeo and his cat would make a nice couple
<PandaFlower> i wonder if i can practice my singing so i can make people's heads asplode when i sing
<HyperSickLugia> Can it pop anything up?
<Skylands> yeah
<Creideiki> Here's an idea? Why not just DCC Skylands the Malwarebytes installer? (Solution.)
<HyperSickLugia> Good, then try to go to "StartUp"
<HyperSickLugia> Well, the installer might be blocked
<Skylands> ok
*Jason puts Aristeo in front of PandaFlower u.u.
<Skylands> on startup
*Jason and his genious ideas
<Creideiki> No harm in trying.
<Skylands> tab
<HyperSickLugia> Can you look for the virus' name?
<Chimera> 04hm
<Chimera> 04Skylands
<HyperSickLugia> As in ..wait a sec
<Chimera> 04I got this thing called iPhoneBrowser
<Skylands> huh
<Chimera> 04You can browse and load files into your iPod
<HyperSickLugia> Ah, move down until you seee AntiMalware GO if it's there
<Chimera> 04Doing so, you'll be able to back up your data
<Skylands> I don't need that
<Chimera> 04k
<Skylands> XD
<Chimera> 04If this'll be fixed via HML's meathods then that's great :3
<HyperSickLugia> XD
<Skylands> yeah I hope so
<Chimera> 04what's so funny HML
<Chimera> 04:<
<Skylands> otherwise I'm stuck on my own
<HyperSickLugia> I had a similar virus on my vista PC
<Chimera> 04:/
<PandaFlower> i wanna try freerunning sometime
<HyperSickLugia> Not funny, I was on another chan .x.
*Jason hugs Aristeo
<Chimera> 04oh k
<Jason> freerunning?
<Skylands> and me with computers themselves = bad
<Ascendant> vistrash
<HyperSickLugia> Yeah..
<PandaFlower> look it up
<Chimera> 04^
<Chimera> 047>vista
<Chimera> 04obviously
<Ascendant> linux > windows
<Skylands> so HML
<PandaFlower> some ppl call it parkhour
<Ascendant> anyway
<Skylands> startup and..?
*Chimera chews Ascendant
<Chimera> 04not helping :3
<HyperSickLugia> But, what chan you see in the scrollbar/window?
<Ascendant> it's proably easiest just to format your comp
<Jason> ah
<Chimera> 046
<Ascendant> after retrieving files
<Chimera> 04*^
<Chimera> 04yeah
<Skylands> well
<Creideiki> Ascendant: No... BSD > Windows > Linux > OSX
<Chimera> 04which is why I suggested iPhoneBrowser
<Skylands> I'll list what it says
<Ascendant> BSD lol
<HyperSickLugia> Good Creideiki XD
<HyperSickLugia> I somewhata agree ;P
<Ascendant> I've only ever used BSD with servers
<Chimera> 04actually Creideiki
<Ascendant> drf's server runs off FreeBSD I think
<Ascendant> But it's still Linux > BSD > Windows > OSX
<Chimera> 04BSD > Windows > Linux > ??? > OSX
*Chimera flees
<Skylands> sttray, jusched, QTTask, iTunes helper, googletoolbar, ctfmon, driverfinder @ HML
<Ascendant> Linux > BSD > Windows > all apply's crap
<Creideiki> Ascendant: No... linux isn't that good.
<Espeon> OPINIONS EVERYWHERE
<HyperSickLugia> ^ yeah
<HyperSickLugia> AND
<HyperSickLugia> NO
<HyperSickLugia> FIXING
<Ascendant> Linux is awesome
<HyperSickLugia> OMG
<Ascendant> QTTask wat
<Skylands> ?
<Ascendant> Can't remember what that is
<HyperSickLugia> Quicktime LOL
<Creideiki> The only place I'll say Linux is better then BSD... is when there's no BSD distro for the system. :P
<Ascendant> OH RIGHT LOL
<Espeon> For some I bet Linux sucks, for some it's great. Same for Windows. End of that.
*Shadow_Lugia 6blinks.
<Skylands> stop with opinions plzzzzz
<Shadow_Lugia> 6^
<Skylands> I need help >>
<Espeon> Don't make me kill you with logic.
<Andres> I parody freerunning occasionally when jumping off 6 meter high ledges ^^
<Creideiki> Linux the IBM System/390 and IBM z/System
<HyperSickLugia> But, might want to try the registry editor.. later
<Ascendant> doesn't seem to be anything out of ordinary
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Was about to present in a slightly looser tone, but:
<Ascendant> Skylands, do you have a windows disc?
<Jason> lol
<PandaFlower> nice ^-^
<Chimera> 04yeah
<Armageddon> heya
<Chimera> 04Ascendant I suggested that
<Andres> It is only like one and a half meters to the water though.
<HyperSickLugia> She said no I think
<Andres> :p
<Skylands> Dont think so, NS
<Ascendant> okay well brb
<Chimera> 04[16:36:15] <Chimera> But anyways, yeah, if you have iTunes (EDIT: no, iPhoneBrowser), I think there's an option to view the iPod Touch's file system
<Chimera> 04[16:36:27] <Chimera> That way you can back up anything you wish to keep
<Chimera> 04[16:36:44] <Chimera> Then you can actually reformat your drive with the Windows disc, if I'm not mistaken.
<Creideiki> Skylands: Trying to DCC you the Malwarebytes installer.
<Chimera> 04huh
<PandaFlower> lol
<Skylands> I can't exactly ask either, dad isn't home
<Chimera> 04.

<Espeon> http://www.precisesecurity.com/rogue/antimalware-go/ this seems very similar to what I did when I got one years ago, and it worked o.o
<Chimera> 04Skylands is on iPoh
<Chimera> 04Pod
<Chimera> 04:E
<Skylands> yeh
<HyperSickLugia> mIRC is dead o.o
<Skylands> it would download to the iPod not comp
<HyperSickLugia> Wait, yeah
<Skylands> :/
<HyperSickLugia> So, no FireFox at all?
<Creideiki> USB cable time?
<Skylands> Hm
<Espeon> It's not a download though, it's a step-by-step thing.
<HyperSickLugia> I wonder if it disabled the internet too
<nickstr> actually cutting a computer off from the internet is a good idea
<Skylands> I'll TRY system restore, though it's bound not to work
<nickstr> because most viruses and pretty much all trojans "phone home" in order to function
<HyperSickLugia> Okay, good luck :|
<nickstr> well cutting a computer off from the internet in the event of an infection that is
<Andres> Yeah, it was especially fun for when I went skinny dipping there while basically unconcious.
<Chimera> 04Espy
<Chimera> 04That link
<Andres> Yay for drinking myself to auto-pilot
<Chimera> 04It might work :D
<Chimera> 04try it SKy
<Andres> Vodka does not go well with beer....
<Chimera> 04also System Restore doesn't do crap :|
<Skylands> on my iPod?
<SilverSonic> NS :3
<HyperSickLugia> o.o
<Chimera> 04No
*SilverSonic huggles
<SilverSonic> XD
<Skylands> well
<Chimera> 04I mean on your PC, silly
<Chimera> 04|D
<Jason> :O
<Skylands> I went in safe mod
<SilverSonic> Hai *says it kirby style*
<Skylands> e
<Jason> true that man
<Skylands> and Internet doesn't work
<HyperSickLugia> I think you did it slightly wrong o.o
<Chimera> 04...
*Jason has redbull and beer
<Chimera> 04You need safe mode with networking
<HyperSickLugia> Did you select with networking option
<Jason> that is like a killer in its self
<Chimera> 04it's a different-
<HyperSickLugia> BIG
<Chimera> 04haha HML
<HyperSickLugia> Difference
<Skylands> which is why I cannot install whatever those bytes were
<Chimera> 04skylands
<HyperSickLugia> LOLM XD
<Chimera> 04with networking
<Creideiki> Skylands: Did you go to the networking optioned safemode other wise... well your interwebs will not work.
<Skylands> k
<HyperSickLugia> Well, that is why we can't do anything
<Chimera> 04:>
<HyperSickLugia> So, reboot
<HyperSickLugia> F8 and press down
<Chimera> 04Yay problem is closer to being solved
<Skylands> derp HML
<HyperSickLugia> Then once you highlighted "Safe Boot With Networking" and enter XD
<Andres> The worst thing was that it all went down in less than twenty minutes.
<Skylands> something I feel good about knowing XD
<Armageddon> ALTAIR
<Armageddon> and Sneas
<Armageddon> dajfshdf
<Armageddon> SilverSonic
*Armageddon hugs back
<Chimera> 04|D
<Andres> Because I pretty much took a sip between every sentence that I contributed to the conversation and every now and then when I didn't
<HyperSickLugia> See, so much easier if you do have internet XD
<Skylands> system restore is almost complete
<Armageddon> also Altair, I somehow managed to type drf as Altair
<Andres> The rest of the night I was lying on my back, occasionally mumbling something in an attempt to contribute to conversation
<Andres> From what I have heard at least.
<Ascendant> system restore is something windows just does not survive without
<Ascendant> XD
<Skylands> w00t
<Andres> Fell onto some pile of rocks somewhen
<Andres> That night
<Skylands> I can get on
<Altair> lol wut
<Altair> XD
<Altair> Hiya
<Skylands> for now
<HyperSickLugia> Yay?
<Andres> Only scratched some skin luckily.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6For now?
<Espeon> Well, when I had a similar one
<Espeon> system restore worked for a limited time
<HyperSickLugia> Now download MB lol
<Espeon> so don't take anything for granted :3
<Skylands> ok hang on
<Ascendant> system restore is glitchy but anyway
<Skylands> I wanna get back in mai
<Andres> The next day I was basically spending the whole day in bed.
<Ascendant> afk
<Skylands> mirc
<Skylands> brb
<Andres> No hangover at least.
<Jason> lol
<Chimera> 04k
<Armageddon> XD
<Andres> The limbs were just not very easily movable.
<HyperSickLugia> Whee
<Armageddon> wb Skylands
<Armageddon> XD
<Skylands> 10ok
<HyperSickLugia> So, seems like we wasted 10 mins on no networking
<Chimera> 04hi
<HyperSickLugia> Whee :D
<PandaFlower> lol
*Jason wants to do that
<Skylands> 10Espeon, link?
<Altair> Hey Skylands
<Jason> but my mom would murder me
<HyperSickLugia> Mah boi
<Skylands> 10ty
<PandaFlower> drink yourself into a coma?
<Chimera> 04http://www.precisesecurity.com/rogue/antimalware-go/ <-- this one?
<Armageddon> got your comp fixed?
<Espeon> that's not a program btw.
<Espeon> But there is a link to a removal kit there somewhere
<Skylands> 10Chimera, if that's the one Xeli posted a few moments ago
<Espeon> probably does all that for you.
<Skylands> 10then yes

<HyperSickLugia> Plus update
<HyperSickLugia> You should do that to MB too XD
<HyperSickLugia> (Once it is on)
<Jason> did anyone read the book that was then, this is now?
<Jason> that is a REALLY strong book
<PandaFlower> lol
<Jason> no, like its about this hippie
<Jason> and he runs away from hom e
<Jason> he gets high just on weed a first
<Skylands> 10Should I perform a scan?
<Jason> and then hi hangs out in this hippie house
<PandaFlower> oooh dalek ^-^
<Jason> and he gets on acid
<Creideiki> Yes, perform a scan.
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> windows likes viruses
<Ascendant> a lot
<Jason> and he finds out that it was his brother that was selling it
<Ascendant> XD
<Jason> and then the hippies life gets screwed up
<Skylands> 10quick or full?
<Jason> the guy calls the cops on his brother
<Creideiki> FULL
<HyperSickLugia> Full
<Espeon> I'd go with full Lol
<nickstr> its because Windows is popular
<Jason> and he goes to jail
<HyperSickLugia> Durr ;D
<nickstr> and Linux is not
<PandaFlower> acid will do that
<Ascendant> derp
<Jason> yeah
<Ascendant> same with BSD
<Chimera> 04mew
<HyperSickLugia> Macs can get viruses too~
*Jason will never get high
<Jason> (on acid)
<Ascendant> well macs are...lol
<HyperSickLugia> Same ones as windows too ;P
*PandaFlower will
<Espeon> Obviously. It's not that Linux is like immune against viruses, it's just that less people use resources on a minority =P
<Jason> :O Acid
<Jason> ?
<Skylands> 10Probably the first time system restore actually worked
<Chimera> 04Espeon
<PandaFlower> just not on acid
<Jason> yeah
<Skylands> 10So yay
<Chimera> 04Such minority is for geeks
<Jason> or meth
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Wallah.
<HyperSickLugia> Very
<Jason> im fine with weed
<Espeon> That's a stereotype lol.
<PandaFlower> eew meth
<Ascendant> iirc there aren't a lot of viruses coded for linux
<Chimera> 04Geeks don't have much to take except computer parts
<Ascendant> derp
<Ascendant> and lol
<PandaFlower> weed? where???
<Ascendant> my teacher was like "linux is an old geek language"
<Chimera> 04theifs do not wish to take computers; they want their IDENTITIES
<Chimera> 04XD
<Espeon> Because fewer people use it as I just said lol
<Ascendant> and I'm like "loool"
<Jason> huh?
<Jason> i know a place where people always sell
<PandaFlower> i've got a hello kitty bowl from japan ^-^
<Jason> the funny thing is, its right beside the police station
<Jason> LOL i should!
<PandaFlower> i need to clean it sometime
<Jason> :O
*Jason wanst s
<Jason> wants*
<Armageddon> dead
<Creideiki> My profs all detest Linux. :P
<Jason> but that book - some powerful shit right there
<Jason> crap*
*Armageddon pulls the chat back from the land of the dead
<Jason> :S Sorry Arii
<HyperSickLugia> Good :3
<Skylands> 1036k scanned, no infections thus far
<Creideiki> Then I have two that were "born, bred, and raised" on Bell Systems UNIX TSS 10.
<Ascendant> heh
<Creideiki> And the other was a BSD boffin.
<Skylands> 10or zero changes to 1
<HyperSickLugia> 36K is nothing XD
<Aristeo> D:
*Skylands jinxed it
<Skylands> 10D:
*Aristeo cries
<Espeon> and suddenly INFECTIONS EVERYWHERE. Happened to me.
<HyperSickLugia> I had like 300,000 files on my PC to scan
<Jason> /me hugs Ari
<HyperSickLugia> took 30 mins XD
<Jason> ya know yer my bro
<Ascendant> I had like
<Sneas> g
<Ascendant> 20 trojans on windows during the holidays
<Ascendant> actually probably more
*Sneas hugs Sky :3
<Skylands> 10Unlike you HML, I probably keep my computer space clean
<Creideiki> It would probably LOVE my 2 TB of pwn. :P (Sorry, 3 TB of pwn now I've an external 1 TB exposed to Vista.)
<Ascendant> and I was like "stuff there, cbf to do anything about it" and wiped windows off lol
<Skylands> 10:P
<Fluorine> lol
<HyperSickLugia> What did you to it ;P
<Ascendant> this*
<nickstr> the fact that they are so big on Unix is interesting
<HyperSickLugia> Oh mai, my laptop is very clean
<nickstr> especially since it was restricted to minicomputers and mainframes for the longest time
<Jason> PandaFlower: do you have a blackberry?
<HyperSickLugia> Windows 7 64 on a supercomputer for gaming = profit
<Ascendant> unix is awesome
<Creideiki> Well, the two on UNIX TSS 10 are rather... old.
<PandaFlower> droid
<Jason> D:
<Chimera> 04heh
<PandaFlower> i don't like blackberries
<Creideiki> And the BSD hopper is more in the middle between "desktops everywhere" and "minis + terminals are the shiznit."
*Jason has the torch
<PandaFlower> i hate butt dialing
*Andres has a dumbphone of ancient times :o
<Andres> At least it takes pictures.
<Jason> butt dialing??
<Jason> Andres: lol
<Chimera> 04lulz
<PandaFlower> dialing with my butt silly
<Creideiki> 80% of the TAs however...
<Creideiki> Well 80% of the TAs are Mac users.
<Creideiki> 19% use Windows
<HyperSickLugia> ew ;)
<Andres> Pictures like this! http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/20832_1212026240873_1835297489_395903_3622942_n.jpg
<Creideiki> And the other 1% uses Xubuntu
<Ascendant> lol Xubuntu
<Andres> Of course, that is Facebook resized, but the point remains ^^
<Jason> lol
<Andres> That is the place I go to swim actually :3
<HyperSickLugia> lol distro #9000
<Ascendant> terminal is awesome
<Jason> thats pretty cool
<PandaFlower> ooh where is that?
<Ascendant> terminal > cmd
<Ascendant> anyway
<Jason> is that is ethiopia
<Jason> ?
<Creideiki> "Why the hell are you using Xubuntu?" "Becuase my PC is a piece of 01,01<bleep>."
<Andres> Lulz at Jason's geography knowledge
<PandaFlower> elbonia?
<Ascendant> Xubuntu somehow reminds me of Archlinux
<Andres> No, Estonia :p
<HyperSickLugia> XD
<HyperSickLugia> Then get a better PC
<Ascendant> dunno why
<Andres> Northern Europe not Africa.
<Jason> lol
<Creideiki> They're a TA. Do you think they have money? :P
<Jason> right ;)
<Ascendant> and doesn't xubuntu use KDE or something? KDE is a nightmare lol
<HyperSickLugia> What's a TA ;P
<Andres> http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/35573_1213257911664_1835297489_398624_3654885_n.jpg
<Creideiki> Kubuntu uses KDE
<Ascendant> yeah
<Dalek> EXTERMINATEß EXTERMINATE
<Creideiki> Xubuntu uses xfce
<Ascendant> KDE is a bloody nightmare
<Creideiki> I like KDE.
<Ascendant> Ah right
<Creideiki> Je deteste Gnome.
<Andres> Look at those bohemians! http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/11452_1096414390649_1835297489_190168_2003990_n.jpg
<Ascendant> Gnome isn't too bad
<Ascendant> xfce is meh
<Dalek> let's try that again
<Ascendant> KDE is...just...lol
<Creideiki> Though I kind of liked CDE. :P
<Ascendant> heh
<Andres> Èxtérminätè
*Skylands pokes Sneas to PM
<Dalek> EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
<Ascendant> I dunno why I'm using Linux Mint
<Jason> ethiopia has its own language
<Jason> ?
<Dalek> XD
<Creideiki> Though, interestingly enough... the only Linux I do happen to enjoy is Debian.
<Ascendant> linux mint 9 isadora which uses gnome
<Ascendant> debian is ool
<Ascendant> cool
<HyperSickLugia> I have only used parted magic XD
<Dalek> has jason never heard of doctor who?
<HyperSickLugia> That was decent
<Ascendant> I like RHEL, Fedora and Linux mint
<Ascendant> and debian
<Ascendant> I've yet to try solaris
<Creideiki> Mostly because I find it's not as "user-friendly" (read "made for people with low IQs") as the *untus.
<Jason> no
<Jason> have you O.o
<Ascendant> XD
<Dalek> omg!
<Creideiki> Plus it's the only thing I've got running on a System/390 mainframe! :P
<Ascendant> ubuntu is meh
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Jason> :)
<Dalek> i'm watching it right now :3
<Ascendant> imo BSD is the best for servers
<Creideiki> (It's also about the only affordable software for an S/390... if you're a hobbyist.)
<Ascendant> people seem to like using centos for servers and I'm like "ew centos" lol
<Ascendant> CentOS is a pain
<Creideiki> "I'd like to run MVS/390?" "Twenty-five thousand dollar, yearly license." "!!!!!"
<Ascendant> x.x
<Ascendant> haha
<Creideiki> That's why mainframes for hobbies... aren't fun. :P
<Jason> ah
<Creideiki> Unless you like hacking obtuse IBM code to bork their license thing.
<HyperSickLugia> LOL
<Creideiki> And you find a company that'll let you "error check" their install media...
<Ascendant> haha IBM lol
<Andres> I have no clue about Ethiopia, never been there.
<HyperSickLugia> WATSON
<HyperSickLugia> ;o
<Ascendant> My school uses ThinkVision/IBM computers
<Ascendant> wait ThinkVision is lenovo
<Andres> Eestil on loomulikult oma keel, ja murdeid jagub kui murdu.
<Ascendant> I swear they use IBM though lol
<Creideiki> Which used to be IBM. :P
<Ascendant> ah right
<nickstr> correct
<Ascendant> that sounds just about right lol
<Skylands> 1050k, 3 infected
<HyperSickLugia> Parted Magic is LXDE lol
<HyperSickLugia> And hah XD
<Skylands> 10Now brb, dinner
<nickstr> until IBM sold their PC division around 2004
<HyperSickLugia> Which folders sky?
<Skylands> 10brb dinner
<Skylands> 10Hm?
<Creideiki> BrockU uses Dell, Dell and more Dell.
<Skylands> 10I dunno yet
<Armageddon> k
<Skylands> 10It's not finished scanning yet
<HyperSickLugia> My school has Dell and Lev.
<Skylands> 10As said previously, brb
<Ascendant> Dell isn't too bad
<HyperSickLugia> That was a semi-joke
<nickstr> funny considering that IBM developed the modern PC model in 1981
<Creideiki> Back in the 70s - going by the computer history exhibit - BrockU used DEC and HP.
<nickstr> and now they don't make them anymore
<Creideiki> The IBM PC was nice.
<HyperSickLugia> Power PC XD
<Creideiki> The PC XT was... interesting and a good expansion.
<Ascendant> heh
<Creideiki> The IBM PC AT... was a godsend.
<Armageddon> tummy ache T_T
<nickstr> the PS/2 really pushed things further forward though
<Creideiki> The IBM PS/2... was a nice boost... and also a gigantic failure. (Hi MCA! Bye MCA!)
<Creideiki> And the IBM PCjr... was hilarious.
<nickstr> that was just a failure
<Creideiki> Er go why I said it was hilarious.
<nickstr> true
<Creideiki> The IBM midrange systems were pretty nice as well.
<HML-Sick> Poor army want a belly rub :o
*HML-Sick mauled
<Armageddon> ._.
<HML-Sick> .c.
<Creideiki> Though I really wish to go back in time and slap the designer of the IBM System/32 upside the head repeatedly...
<Armageddon> bbl
<Ascendant> bbl
<Creideiki> Mostly becuase of... reasons unknown to the world... the System/32 - start of the midrange boxen, and ancestor of the AS/400 - made the 5250 terminal.
<Jason> hmm
<Jason> Estonia has its own language?
<Creideiki> Whereas the mainframes used the 3270, and the PCs didn't exist yet.
<Creideiki> If the S/32 used the 3270 one wouldn't need three different terminal emulators if one is working on multiple IBM systems and non-IBM systems. :P
<Andres> Yes, as I just said in Estonian.
<Andres> Basically every European country has at least one language of their own.
<Jason> huh
<Jason> not england ;)
<Andres> Right, because English and the various other languages in Great Britain are not their own.
<Andres> <.<
<Jason> EXACTLY!
<Jason> what are the other langs?
<PandaFlower> apparently mibbit doesn't like daleks
<Jason> huh
<Jason> lol
<Jason> dont use mibbit
<Jason> are you on windows?
<Andres> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Great_Britain
<PandaFlower> i'm on my phone atm
<Jason> :O
<Chimera> 04hm
<Jason> do you have a windows comp though?
<Chimera> 04Anyone know what reversed hex looks like?
<PandaFlower> 2 lol
<HyperSickLugia> Not really
<Chimera> 04:/
<Chimera> 04well
<Chimera> 04I'm trying to mess with loop points
<Jason> huh
<PandaFlower> my laptop is broke and my other compy is only for gaming
<Jason> you should get a shell and just run irssi off it
<Chimera> 04And apparently atthe end of each track, you can loop by adding "94 xx xx xx xx"
<Jason> or just install linux on one of yer comeps
<Jason> comps*
<PandaFlower> eeew linux
<Chimera> 04the 4 xx's represent where the track should jump to in reversed hex
<PandaFlower> i'm a windows girl
<Chimera> 04But... I'm ignorant as to what the format of reversed hex is :
<Chimera> 04:E
<Jason> :O
<Jason> have ya tried linux?
*Espeon flops on Shiny.
<PandaFlower> i accidentally dropped my laptop and it broke or i'd be on it
<Espeon> =)
<Chimera> 04unless it's something like: 89 0A F8 00 (normal) -> 00 F8 0A 89
*Shiny-Growlithe sprawls out under Espeon
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:3
<Chimera> 04Just wnna make sure it is that
<Jason> My comp = my laptop = my server are all running off linux
<Chimera> 04Sninyyyyyyyyyyyyy

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Ray
<Skylands> 10Thanks HML
<Skylands> 10I restarted and it's all good now
<Quilava> hi Shinye
<Skylands> 10It found 3 trojans, removed 'em
<SilverSonic> Shiny ;D
<SilverSonic> Hiya :3
<HyperSickLugia> Breat

<Quilava> :(
<Creideiki> Skylands: Now that it's gone, I highly suggest getting thyself an actual antivirus.
<Skylands> 10Any suggestions? Free ones preferably
<Creideiki> http://www.avast.com/en-ca/index <-- Avast! free
<HyperSickLugia> I'd just keep MB :|
<HyperSickLugia> AVAST
<Skylands> 10MB?
<HyperSickLugia> OVERRATED
<Skylands> 10Oh
<HyperSickLugia> What you just used XD
<Skylands> 10Nvm, abbreviation
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Better than nothing
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02IMO
<Espeon> But very much functional
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Quil~
<Creideiki> HML: Who cares if it's overrated if it gets the job done?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Sorry I didn't see you say hi ;v;
<Skylands> 10MacAfee is the last one I had
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Exactly
<Skylands> 10It was a waste
<Creideiki> LOL MacAfee
<HyperSickLugia> Baad
<HyperSickLugia> I had to kill it from my laptop
<Skylands> 10Norton years ago (before it was proven to not work)
<HyperSickLugia> I had macafee on my XPS700
<Creideiki> My old high school used MacAfee...
<Creideiki> The techs loved it.
<Creideiki> Because they get paid per maintenance call. :P
*HyperSickLugia lolols and thinks we should all ask TG to tell us about antivurs </carcasm>
<HyperSickLugia> And typo
*HyperSickLugia only has MB on his PC since he rarely uses it
<Skylands> 10CARcasm
<Creideiki> But yes Skylands, just get Avast (and register, it's free... and you need to reg it any way (whoopdeedo?).)
<PandaFlower> eeew linux
<HyperSickLugia> I don't like any registering
<Skylands> 10Creideiki, I'll hold off on that for now
<Sneas> (=) (:) E:3
<Sneas> E=3
<NightSeas> Heya Skylands :3
<HyperSickLugia> Doesn't avast have popup notifications?
<Skylands> 10Unless things become hopeless
<Creideiki> That's what disposable e-mail addresses are for, HML. :P
<Creideiki> Skylands: No, do not hold off on getting an AV.
<PandaFlower> rose tyler just died :( she was my fave character
<Creideiki> Problems get solved before they happen if you have an antivirus that actively kills the virii dead.
<NightSeas> What's going on?
<HyperSickLugia> Skylands, Avast is kinda slowish on startup XD
<Skylands> 10Meh
<Creideiki> HML: How do you mean on startup?
<PandaFlower> ooh the hunt for red october :D
<Creideiki> You mean booting the interface for a scan? Or on system bootup?
<HyperSickLugia> Or is that AVG
<NightSeas> Skylands needs a antivirus?
<HyperSickLugia> On system boot
<Skylands> 10No, GL
<Skylands> 10I never planned on getting one
<HyperSickLugia> Like loading windows and startup stuff XD
<NightSeas> XD
<Creideiki> Nope, doesn't seem that bad on bootup.
<Skylands> 10Though Creideiki insists
<HyperSickLugia> You don't really need it
<Creideiki> (Going by my grandfather's mildly crap P3.)
<Skylands> 10Don't worry, HML
<Creideiki> Yes, you do need an AV.
<Skylands> 10I'm not downloading it either way
<Aristeo> I'm a linux girl
<HyperSickLugia> No, MB shall be fine enough!~
<Creideiki> Only morons, and mac users don't have AVs.
<HyperSickLugia> ....
<Creideiki> Do YOU want to be a Mac user?
<HyperSickLugia> You're calling
<HyperSickLugia> Me ... a mac user?@?@?@?@?
<PandaFlower> ooh she's still alive :D
<HyperSickLugia> That's worse than calling me stupid!
<Aristeo> :D
<HyperSickLugia> (Since I dislike apple ;p )
<Skylands> 10The only Apple product I like to use is iPod
<Aristeo> I wish I could be a cute girl for like a week
<Skylands> 10So shush
<NightSeas> I’ve tried over 13 (free/1month) antivirus programs, and the only one that works is no antivirus and Norton 360
<Skylands> 10Norton lolwhut
<Creideiki> Meh, whatever...
<Skylands> 10Norton destoryed my computer
<Skylands> 10destoryed*
<Skylands> 10...
<Creideiki> My box always has an AV on it. Becuase I prefer not to deal with virii ever.
<HyperSickLugia> How?
<Skylands> 10destroyed*
<NightSeas> Hmm, whats your OS?
<Skylands> 10By not doing its job, HML
<PandaFlower> lol
<Andres> Even a day would be interesting.
<Skylands> 10Windows XP, GL
<HyperSickLugia> XP
<Creideiki> So I let it, and its firewall make sure I don't get virii. :P
<Andres> Of course, that would mean locking myself in a room for the whole day <.<
<NightSeas> I have XP too. FireFox does the job
<HyperSickLugia> I've never gotten Virii on my laptop nor PC
<HyperSickLugia> FF is meh
<Creideiki> (And if I do happen to get one, it's promptly removed from being functional before it can DO anything. :P )
<Creideiki> Firefox is good.
<HyperSickLugia> I should get my virtual PC a virus
*Skylands lulz at the fact of her virus causing all of this debate on which antivirus program is the best
<HyperSickLugia> FF is slow and rather small in render sizings
<Aristeo> I'd probably go after a guy and a girl then
<HyperSickLugia> Plus, I hate the download manager
<NightSeas> You have a virus sky?
<Skylands> 10I had one around 20 minutes ago
<NightSeas> What is it's ID?
<Skylands> 10Thank god people at TST know their stuff to assist me and my computer
<HyperSickLugia> Aka DRF and Me ;P
<Skylands> 10Can't remember the name, GL
<Creideiki> Ahem.
<Skylands> 10I mentioned it earlier
<HyperSickLugia> And you
<HyperSickLugia> Too :3
<Andres> Well, my personality would still be horrible, so I would not even waste the time.
<HyperSickLugia> Not too important anyway
<NightSeas> Was the virus called Windows Defender?
<HyperSickLugia> LOL
<HyperSickLugia> Hhaahahaahah
<Creideiki> NS: It was "Antimalware GO"
<PandaFlower> lol
<Skylands> 10Looking back at logs
<Skylands> 10it was called AntiMalware Go
<Creideiki> I just said that. :P
<HyperSickLugia> I have windows defender XD
*Skylands is afraid to get back onto Bulbapedia again
<HyperSickLugia> Why?
<junh1024-XD> u got virus?
<Skylands> 10Cuz that's when AntiMalware Go came
<Creideiki> Don't all Windii have Windoze Defenderp installed automatically now? :P
<Aristeo> :3
<HyperSickLugia> Durrrurr!
<Aristeo> PandaFlower: are you a cute girl? :o
<NightSeas> HML, theres a fake windows defender that finds and attacks your computer
<HyperSickLugia> I had that on the vista
<PandaFlower> yep ^-^
<Creideiki> Naturally... it's the one that comes on the OS distro disc. :P
<Creideiki> BRB phone call.
<NightSeas> OMG AntiMalware Go attacked my computer before I had Norton
<HyperSickLugia> Mkay
<HyperSickLugia> What happened to it?
<PandaFlower> poor dalek
<NightSeas> It makes it super hard to go online
<NightSeas> And play games
<Skylands> 10What does? Norton?
<HyperSickLugia> No, that fake
<NightSeas> No, AntiMalware Go
<Skylands> 10AntiMalwareGo didn't let me access anything, so yeah
<NightSeas> When I got it I could not go online for anything
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ah, AntiMalaware
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Got that a while ago
<PandaFlower> brb. grimm isn't online and someone just jumped in system
<HyperSickLugia> My vista PC had over 130 viruses
<HyperSickLugia> I loled hard
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And?
*Shiny-Growlithe doesn't get it
<HyperSickLugia> It lived
<HyperSickLugia> :D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So did mine :3
<NightSeas> And when you think you got rid of it. It's there
<HyperSickLugia> I had Antivirus 2008/07 on my XPS 700 x.x
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I've had no more problems with it
<HyperSickLugia> It was horrile
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It's been 3 months now
<HyperSickLugia> *Horrible
<NightSeas> It was the piece of crap McAfee that gave me it
<NightSeas> Never get McAfee
<NightSeas> It don't work
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I have McAfee
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Don't use it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But it's just there
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Roara
<Espeon> ~
*Skylands used to have McAfee
<Skylands> 10as stated eaelier
<Skylands> 10earlier*
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes
<Skylands> 10also, when my mum got a new laptop

<NightSeas> It slowwwwws my computer down
<NightSeas> But hey, I have no virus XD
<Aurora> EW THAT
<PandaFlower> crap we just identified them. grimm is nowhere to be found and there's a minimum of 12 divisions of the wall bearing down on us. looks like i'm in command
<Aurora> that's what destroyed my old laptop
<Aurora> 6and several other of my friends' computers
<Andres> What came is this? :o
<HyperSickLugia> Saame X.x
<PandaFlower> descent freespace
<HyperSickLugia> I saved my XPS 700 from it
<HyperSickLugia> THANK YOU MB
<Aurora> 6but the thing is
<Aurora> 6I've no idea how it got on there
<Aurora> 6we wiped the computer
<Aurora> 6and there it was
<Aurora> 6right when we restarted it
<PandaFlower> we've only got 2 divisions that have recieved the new weapons so far in the fleet :(
<NightSeas> Skylands, go to “Add & Remove programs” and see if you can find AntiMalware Go in there
<Skylands> 10Why should I?
<Skylands> 10Malwarebytes removed it
<NightSeas> It’s ID is that of a program
<Skylands> 10I don't see it listed
<NightSeas> hm
<NightSeas> Then yeah, just use Malwarebytes
<Aurora> 6so yeah
<Aurora> 6I've found an interesting link between people with horrible typing skills
<Aurora> 6and college students X.x
<HyperSickLugia> What is it?
<Aurora> 6online courses are hilarious, because the kind of typing we consider "noobish"....is the most common kind of typing in my class
<Aurora> 6all college students, most above the age of 22
<NightSeas> Be careful though, there’s a chance that it will start up your computer again, it will start up
<TR_Reed> 14lol
<HyperSickLugia> I doubt it
<Aurora> 6grammar errors, punctuation fail, no capital letters, spelling issues
<Chimera> 04AURORA
<Chimera> 04I successfully cracked looping
<Chimera> 04:D
<Aurora> 6one person actually writes like "i need 2 eat rite to balance my diet"
<Chimera> 04:DDDD
<Aurora> 6I'm like =+=
<Aurora> 6=_=
<HyperSickLugia> lol
<Chimera> 04so now
<HyperSickLugia> .x.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ew bad typing
<TR_Reed> 14LOL
<Chimera> 04I can make a midi of Vs. Steven
<Chimera> 04or get one
<Chimera> 04and BWify it
<Chimera> 04and have it loop
<Chimera> 04:>
<Aurora> 6ANGEL
<Chimera> 04Win?
*Aurora 6asplodes
<Aurora> 6also
<Aurora> 6that's glorious
<Chimera> 04Indeed
<Angel_Espeon> 13i don't even shorten words when texting, I'd much rather spend an extra 10p of credit typing my texts in full than shortening all the words to make the message shorter :B
<HyperSickLugia> ANGEL :D
<Chimera> 04My theory was correct
<NightSeas> My parents killed me for getting that virus, lol
<Armageddon> heya Zephyr /late
<Zephyr> Haha heya
<Chimera> 04See, the looping is controlled by being (usually) at the bottom of a track
<Zephyr> No worries, I respond late all the time
<Armageddon> XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:U
<NightSeas> Saying “what kind of sites are going on”
<HyperSickLugia> XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Btw, I don't think it's NS's birthday anymore
<HyperSickLugia> Oh lawdy
<Chimera> 04The loop is pointed out by starting with 94, and has 3 strings of hex in Endian
<Chimera> 04AKA reversed hex
<Creideiki> Though my birthday is tomorrow. :P
<Chimera> 04It ends with FF, signaling the loop point definition is over
<Creideiki> </random>
<NightSeas> you+
<Chimera> 04So I made the loop point somewhere else
<TR_Reed> 14my birthday is today
<HyperSickLugia> Lies ;(
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13FFFF how did I not notice that
<HyperSickLugia> ;o
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13Happy birthday :D
<Chimera> 04It's funny: you can actually make the songs sound very, VERY screwed up if you make the loop point not where the other ones are
<HyperSickLugia> hAPPY BIRTHDAY TR
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02FFS
<Aurora> 6lol
<TR_Reed> 14thanks :)
<Creideiki> Happy birthday TR_Reed
<TR_Reed> 14thanks
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I hate it when it doesn't just reconnect me if I've been disconnected
<Chimera> 04But that's not what I'm trying to do so
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Nope, have to type something so it can tel me I was disconnected, THEN reconnect me
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 1314's my favourite number, so make sure you have a good year xD
<Chimera> 04I'm gonna have to find a way to identify when I should have the song loop
<Chimera> 04hm
<Armageddon> XD
<Chimera> 04I think I has an idea :>
<TR_Reed> 14lol
<NightSeas> Skylands, just make sure you don’t push any buttons it tries to give you
<Armageddon> Type a script trigger
<Armageddon> if there's no response, then you're not connected
<HyperSickLugia> What buttons
<HyperSickLugia> And what sites GL :(
<Aurora> 6 5 is my favorite number
<Aurora> 6UNIVERSAL NUMBER
<NightSeas> AntiMalware Go

<HyperSickLugia> Heya Test
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Went to say hi to you NS and it disconnected me
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 135 s the only odd number I like xD
<TR_Reed> 14bye test...
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Wasn't talking before then because I was looking at something else
<NightSeas> <HyperSickLugia> What buttons <--Buttons AntiMalware Go gives you
<Armageddon> Ah
<Armageddon> well heya
<HML-Sick> Yeah XD
<TR_Reed> 14odd numbers are just misunderstood
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13I dislike 3 the most, something about it bothers me :<
*Ray <3 7
<TR_Reed> 14:O
<HyperSickLugia> I hate 8
<Creideiki> I like two and powers of two. :P
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13Yet I'd rather sort things into groups of 3 than groups of 4, which is actually my favourite single-digit number
<NightSeas> “YOU HAVE A VIRUS” “Push button to clean computer now” AntiMalware Go used to say to me
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13is that weird? :<
<HyperSickLugia> I like bits ;P

<Ascendant> heh
<Kosovo> XD

<Skylands> 10I might buy it for that reason alone
<HyperSickLugia> O.o

<Ascendant> they killed his look
<Lullabye> o.o
<Skylands> 10I was already upset when they changed him once
<Skylands> 10Now this...
<Kosovo> tbh I wouldn't even know that was spyro unless I was previously told XD
<Creideiki> Okay...
<Armageddon> there we go
<Creideiki> I believe ocean.lugia.us just crashed.
<Creideiki> Are there any other SSL enabled servers in the network?
<Aurora> 6I actually liked the designs for the last series
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02[17:37] <Skylands> 10I was already upset when they changed him once <== Same
<Aurora> 6with cynder and all
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But well
<Aurora> 6granted....they looked horrible until the 3rd game
<Lullabye> n.n
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol, I liked Cynder, and the story was all right (except for Sparx who I can never get that horror of him out of my head)
<Ascendant> Creideiki, island.lugia.us +6697 / use tst.lugia.us +6697 to connect
<NightSeas> <Creideiki> I believe ocean.lugia.us just crashed. <-- It did, but it's back up again
<Ascendant> derp
<Ascendant> ocean has been very unstable recently
<NightSeas> I'm now on ocean again
<Creideiki> Naturally it's back up again, I've connected via SSL.

<HyperMetalLugia> You're worse than me

<Ascendant> and then it's like "ow my head"
<HyperMetalLugia> What a better role model than Rora
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Ascendant> and lol "ow my head" reminds me of Megamind
<HyperMetalLugia> I never have trees to run into
<Aurora> 6I have a scar from where I ran into a door pole
<Ascendant> "OW! My giant blue head!"
<HyperMetalLugia> I need to see that XD

<Aurora> 6geometry
<Ascendant> which is 160 hours
<Aurora> 6TF proofs D<
<HyperMetalLugia> ..wow
<Ascendant> that's my idle time on another network lol
<Ray> 02So... the Idle Master/King/Ruler/etc... is Samui?
<Ascendant> no it's me!
<Aurora> 6TF proofs are crap
*Ascendant hides

<HyperMetalLugia> noooooooooooooooooooO
<Chimera> 04.
<Chimera> 04:<
*HyperMetalLugia runs from it
<Chimera> 04because
<Ray> 02I NEED THIS GAMEEEEE.
<HyperMetalLugia> GET.. IT...away..from..mee...
<Aurora> 6(V) pacman
<Chimera> 04this program that detects there- lol
<Aurora> 6yes I need this game
<HyperMetalLugia> There are..?
<Chimera> 04this program that detects where the track offsets are
<Chimera> 04is written in C++
<Aurora> 6current estimated release date is march 13th
<HyperMetalLugia> And compile?
<Chimera> 04and it has this
<Chimera> 04hold on
<Ray> 02<33333
<Ray> 02Neeed it
<Ray> 02but I wonder... will my BAD pc support such amount of EPIC?
<Aurora> 6and then touhou 13 has been announced
<Aurora> 6the demo will be available at the next con, which is the 8th...?
<Aurora> 6and then yeah, as long as the pattern continues
<Aurora> 6we'll see touhou 13 in august
<Aurora> 6I still need fairy wars though lol
*Creideiki is back (gone 00:18:16)
<Aurora> 6I also need phantasmagoria of flower view...
<Aurora> 6forgot about that
<Angel_Espeon> 13I officially NEED that game now o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 133D danmakuuuuu
<Aurora> 6I KNOW RIGHT
<Aurora> 6like
<Aurora> 6more serious than IaMP, SWR, and UNL lololololol
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also lol, I've played PoFV against a friend online before
<Angel_Espeon> 13SO MUCH LAG
<Ray> 02LAG = fun?
<Angel_Espeon> 13still pretty fun though xD
<Armageddon> nah
<Aurora> 6aero and I play UNL against each other all the time
<Creideiki> Isn't Phantasmagoria a very, very bad FMV game that The Spoony One did an LP of?
<Aurora> 6most of the time, it's minimal lag
<Aurora> 6freaking fun
<Fluorine> Me
<Fluorine> :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13The lag caused the game to go on for ages though since it made dodging bullets a lot easier for both of us
<Aurora> 6but yeah PoFV has a LOT more going on than UNL
<Aurora> 6being an actual danmaku fight
<Angel_Espeon> 13I haven't played it in forever though, probably because I don't like the gameplay as much
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I don't fully understand the storyline either |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Something about flowers
<Aurora> 6the storyline....I know the very very basic of it
<Angel_Espeon> 13and Komachi being a lazy bum as always
<Aurora> 6and shikieki JUDGMENT
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6dbdrkt

<Lullabye> http://www.deviantart.com/#/d3aletq
<Angel_Espeon> 13One of the main reasons I played PoFV was for Komachi
<Angel_Espeon> 13since she's one of my favourite characters xD
<Quilava> back
<Aurora> 6komachi is awesome yep
<Aurora> 6and i haven't even played the game
<HML-Sick> WB Quilava
<Aurora> 6I've got 3 fav characters LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm assuming those three to be Flandre, Remilia and Sakuya? xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've got too many faves to count :|
<Aurora> 6nope
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6if you want to count all my favs...

<Aurora> 6but then again
<Aurora> 6MASTER SPARK
<Ray> 02o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13Suddenly I'm wondering what would happen if, somehow, two master sparks collided
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6the universe would explode
*Quanyails 7read that as aero-zero.net
*Ray wonders if the "death bombing" will be enabled
<Ray> 02.-.
<Ray> 02after killing someone... they just say:
<Ray> 02haha, death bombing.
<Ray> 02OooOoooOoooOok.... I saw the master spark...
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's scary/awesome :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13I wouldn't mind being killed by one of those
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd be proud to have "death by master spark" on my gravestone
<Ray> 02^
<HyperMetalLugia> I'd be more proud to have "Death by taco"

<Jason> Anyone wanna tell her what happened with the shower?
<HyperMetalLugia> I need to watch them all agin
<HyperMetalLugia> *again ;.;
<Ascendant> but heh, Robin would make such an awesome apprentice
<HyperMetalLugia> To evil ;.;
<Ascendant> if he ever started obeying Slade like
<Aurora> 6robin annoyed me
<PandaFlower> someone replaced your water with kerosene?
<Andres> Jason was forced to pick up the soap
<Ascendant> robin was kinda annoying but hey
<Ascendant> he's like Slade
<Aurora> 6but hey, yeah
<PandaFlower> lol
<Aurora> 6I acknowledge that LOL
*Jason was cleaning the showe

<Aurora> 6ever think slade was his father?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes XD
<Andres> With the dropped soap
<Aurora> 6cuz I remember
<Jason> and then i decided to use toilet bowl cleaner
<Aurora> 6thinking that
<Ascendant> yeah
<Aurora> 6for the longest time
<Aurora> 6I still do
<Ascendant> XD
<Jason> not noticing that there was bleach on the floor
<HyperMetalLugia> THE scary part XD
<Jason> and then it started mixing
<Jason> and fizzing up
<HyperMetalLugia> In the volcano
<Ascendant> oh remember in the apprentice arc
<Jason> and then smoke came out
<Ascendant> when half of Slade's mask comes off?
<PandaFlower> lol fail you made mustard gas
<Andres> And then Jason died and we all were happy.
<Jason> then i called poison control
<HyperMetalLugia> YEss ;.;
<HyperMetalLugia> RUBY EYE
<HyperMetalLugia> Eeep
<Aurora> 6yep
<Aurora> 6his hair totally looked like robin's
*Aurora 6runs
<Jason> and it turned out to be some kind of highly toxic gas
<Ascendant> he doesn't look like his comic self...sort of could have been batman in disguise
<Ascendant> yeah XD
<Andres> Did you die? :o
<PandaFlower> mustard gas
<Jason> it eats away at your lungs and other tissue
<Andres> Please say yes!
<Armageddon> ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> Could be like in Star Wars Episode 5!
<Jason> Andres: yes, i died
<Ascendant> lmfao
<HyperMetalLugia> And Luke goes into the cave
<Ascendant> I liked Star Wars Episode 3
<Ascendant> where Anakin goes to the dark side /random
<HyperMetalLugia> 3 was the best out of all the firsts
<Jason> but really, it was horrible
<Ascendant> I can't remember any of the other chars in Teen Titans
<Jason> and now my throat hurts a lot
<HyperMetalLugia> I didn't really like 5
<PandaFlower> bleach + ammonia makes mustard gas
<HyperMetalLugia> MAD MOXD

<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm?
<Ascendant> where's there's a race for Robin's suitcase
<Ascendant> and RED X
<Ascendant> Red X was awesome XD
<HyperMetalLugia> YES
<Jason> smoking seems to make it hurt more
<Jason> i dunno why
<Ascendant> well It was something like episode 40something or whatnot
<HyperMetalLugia> Wasn't that the ep when he stole that stuff?
<HyperMetalLugia> For that guy..
<Ascendant> where they're all racing the Daddy guy
*HyperMetalLugia hazy memory
<Ascendant> for Robin's suitcase?

<Ascendant> and it's like "And the T-Car comes 3rd!"
<Ascendant> *riding on a 2-wheel thing that looks like a scooter*
<Ascendant> XD
<PandaFlower> jason go to the hospital! even brief exposure to mustard gas which is what you made can be lethal
<Aurora> 6lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, like after the arc with Terra, I stoped watching XD
<HyperMetalLugia> What
<Aurora> 6I love how many times that car got destroyed
<Ascendant> yeah
<Andres> Maybe because smoking is not exactly gentle on the airways.
<HyperMetalLugia> Speed buggy physics XD
<Ascendant> and then Cyborg or someone always manages to fix it
<Ascendant> xD
<Andres> Panda, stop trying to save him, we can turn this into a good thing :o
<Jason> PandaFlower: i called poison control, they said it was gonna be OK
<Ascendant> the teen titans series were pretty awesome
<Jason> Andres: shutuop

<SheenaFox> kk
<NightSeas> Seeyas
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<NightSeas> Hallo HML :3
<Ascendant> Hm
<Kosovo> hi Sheena
<SheenaFox> hi Kosovo
<Ascendant> Would anyone use ipv6 if I installed it on drf's server, provided that he agrees?
<Ascendant> Because if no one is going to use it I'm not going to bother
<NightSeas> What is ipv6?
<Armageddon> ohai
<Ascendant> IPv6
<Ascendant> We use IPv4
<Ascendant> it's the newest version of IP addresses I guess
<NightSeas> [does not know very much about codes]
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah
<SilverSonic> D; my head is killing me x.x
<Ascendant> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<NightSeas> Oh, I see
<HyperMetalLugia> Since my PC has IPv6
<HyperMetalLugia> And nothing works with it XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, it is actually rather old
<NightSeas> Thanks for the link
<Ascendant> 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
<PandaBlossom> hmmm no comment on my dream car
<Ascendant> that's an IPv6 address
<jasperbot> =D
<Ascendant> minus the dot
<HyperMetalLugia> Sadly, iPv4 is only 32 bit based
<NightSeas> Be going now~
<Ascendant> I swear it was 64 or something, can't remember though
<Ascendant> it was either 8, 32 or 64
*Ascendant braindead
<Aristeo> I didn't know that was a car
<Ascendant> or 16
<HyperMetalLugia> Hah
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<HyperMetalLugia> 16bit for IPv4 is bad
<PandaBlossom> yep :D
<HyperMetalLugia> IPV6 is 64 bit
<Armageddon> >:
<PandaBlossom> look it up
<PandaBlossom> i want a lancia stratos
<Armageddon> heya
<PandaBlossom> there's a joke that lancias only came in black and rust
<Ascendant> ah right
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> if I installed it, would you use it?
<Marik> hai
<HyperMetalLugia> Since 4billion - 32bit
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, if I can
<HyperMetalLugia> Since I would need to figure out how to get a IPV6 adress x.x
<Umbreon> 12back
<HyperMetalLugia> Thing is, most ISPs don't support or even know of IPv6, so you can't connect to it using it
<PandaBlossom> they had all the major mechanical firsts
<PandaBlossom> first electric spoiler, first v6, first 5 speed gearbox, first car with turbo and superchargers on the same engine
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...

<Chimera> Good job :3
*HML-Sick yawns
<Chimera> I think it's a "weeder class"
<Sakuya> Math for nonmath people
<Chimera> You take it to see if you'll actually commit to college or something
<DeadCrab> ahahaha my car scares the hell out of jenny now XD
<Chimera> Yeah :c
<Sakuya> But not a weeder
<Chimera> Hm?
<Chimera> Why do you take it then?
<Sakuya> This is a logic class
<Chimera> Ah
<Sakuya> Um...i hate math
<DeadCrab> i handed her the keys this morning and kicked her out for scool and was like keep it under 85
<Chimera> As do I
<Sakuya> I'm in an art major

<Chimera> K
<Chimera> Oh also Roara, I think I reached a problem :/
<Chimera> Two actually
<Aristeo> :3
<Aristeo> How old is she DeadCrab?
<Chimera> In order to add Steven and not replace anyone I'll need some beta data to exist in the code
<Chimera> Of BW
<Chimera> If there's any unused OWs and any unused trainer sprites I can use those to make Steven, but if there aren't, then no dice
<Sakuya> You can't just replace some random person?
<Chimera> Well it depends on which person
<HyperMetalLugia> Plus text data and events..
<Chimera> Yep
<Chimera> Sparkeh
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Sparky
<Sparky> heya
<drf|laptop> 03ohai
<Sparky> Chimerah
<drf|laptop> 03done watching the movie
<Sparky> ohey
<drf|laptop> 03also man
<HyperMetalLugia> Oha DRF
<Sparky> what movie?
<drf|laptop> 03I want a good remaster of Cloak and Dagger
<drf|laptop> 03it's such an awesome movie
<drf|laptop> 03but like
<drf|laptop> 03the DVD has no menus, no special features, no subtitles, NOTHING
<drf|laptop> 03it's kinda a shame :(
<drf|laptop> 03And Sparky, Remember the Titans. My friend and I were watching it.
<drf|laptop> 03Great movie
<Chimera> Anyway if the "random person" is quite common, then it'll be very VERY hard to replace him/her with stwven, Sakuya
<Chimera> *Steven
<Sakuya> Hmm
<Sparky> ooh, great movie
<Chimera> If the person is a one-
<Chimera> I GOT IT
<Sakuya> Oo
<Chimera> Replace Miyamoto with Steven
<Chimera> :D

<Sakuya> Miyawho?
<Chimera> erm
<Light_Latias> lolwut
<Chimera> One of the devs of the game
<PandaBlossom> he's outside working on his car. i'm on the phone with him atm
<Chimera> You fight him
<Chimera> I forgot who
<Sakuya> Oh
<Sakuya> Lol
<PandaBlossom> want me to ask?
<Sakuya> I was gonna suggest that
<Sakuya> But I didn't know his name
<Chimera> K :3
<Chimera> His team is subpar anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> Replace N's sprite with Stevens :P
<Chimera> The three monkeys, the fossils, and-
<Chimera> Rofl
<Sakuya> NOoooooo
<HyperMetalLugia> Yesss
<HyperMetalLugia> Evil Steven
<Chimera> Steven went stark raving insane and ran Team Plasma
<Sakuya> I dont want evil-
<Sakuya> Yeh...
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes X
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<PandaBlossom> lmao he's cussing up a storm apparently he pinched his hand with his wrench
<HyperMetalLugia> Sad ending
<Aristeo> Sure xD
<Chimera> nah
<HyperMetalLugia> After you becom champion
<Aristeo> :O
<Chimera> I had the thought of replacing N with Steven but
<Chimera> Nah
<PandaBlossom> i'll wait until he's done swearing at his engine
<Chimera> N's a major plot point so :E
*Sparky chucks a Minezumi and runs
<Chimera> Hur
<HyperMetalLugia> That'll make it worse or better?
<Sparky> gosh that's so similar to my email XD

<Chimera> I think I could replace one of the sages (they only give you items and act sad)
<PandaFlower> and that she won't let him have a beer
<Sakuya> Nah, they're part of a story I think
<Chimera> True
<Chimera> Who to replace...
<Chimera> I wonder if there are any negligable one-offs anywhere in the game.
<Sakuya> Either the director or keep looking
<Chimera> :c
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, what about that digdug guy?

<n2> unless you can solve million dollar math equations, password cracking is the electronic equlivant of watching paint dry
<HyperMetalLugia> I always type it as eXKAR
<Sakuya> I always tab his name
<Quilava> bye
<HyperMetalLugia> How I,o
<nickstr> it is
<Sakuya> Actually no I don't,i just felt like sounding smart
<HyperMetalLugia> Tab never works for me
<eXAKR> oo
<HyperMetalLugia> I was never even bothered with the tab command in MIRC
<Sakuya> This class

<n2> yay, your not dead!
<eXAKR> Oh God P=NP
<Umbreon> 12eXAKR
<Umbreon> 12you can't say you ever made a weird mistake?
<Sparky||HW> it's got a basket of bells and whings and things that make it look good.
<eXAKR> I do
<n2> you understand what would happen if you could prove P=NP right exakr?
<HyperMetalLugia> Nothing?
<Sakuya> Wait
<n2> you break every single secure protocol in the world
<Sakuya> P=np?
<HyperMetalLugia> Password= No Password?
<eXAKR> Breakthrough in computer science
<eXAKR> I know
*eXAKR plants a botfly larvae in HyperMetalLugia
<eXAKR> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%3DNP
<Chimera> Lul
*HyperMetalLugia makes it into his pet
<n2> pretty much all security works on the basis that you cant prove P=NP
<eXAKR> "The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be efficiently checked by a computer can also be efficiently solved by a computer."
<n2> if you can however, that means it wont take 4 quadrillion years to crack RSA
*Sparky||HW introduces a yukkuri into the chat
<Chimera> Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be efficiently checked by a computer can also be efficiently solved by a computer.
<Chimera> Okay even though that's informal I STILL don't get that
<Chimera> Dx
<HyperMetalLugia> same
<HyperMetalLugia> It's stupid ;P
<n2> in the simplist terms i can say
<eXAKR> It will make your head asplode Chimera
<n2> its saying if you can check for X
<n2> can you also solve for X?
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<Chimera> L
<Chimera> *k
<HyperMetalLugia> HE DIEd xd
<PandaBlossom> i think he's arguing with nikki's sister lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Hate capslock
<HyperMetalLugia> I never use it
<Chimera> Um
<Chimera> Wtf does that mean LOL
<eXAKR> P=NP killing people
<n2> you know how you can go into wolframalpha and type in your calc homework
<eXAKR> As I said
<n2> and it will give you the zeros
<eXAKR> Math = suicide
<n2> you can check the zeros using the computer, but can you make a computer actually find the zeros
<PandaBlossom> he's arguing with a girl trying to get her to go under his car and get a spark plug
<n2> math nerds will kill me for making that compairson
<n2> but the idea is about the same
<Chimera> Haha
<Aristeo> D:
<Chimera> What do you need a computer to find numbers for?
<Chimera> I found the numbers
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Chimera> With my EYES.
*Chimera flees
<n2> think of it this way
<eXAKR> http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP <- maybe this will make things simplier
<n2> if you prove P=NP
<n2> then you win a million dollars
<eXAKR> http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/explainer-pnp.html
<PandaBlossom> lol i think i just heard nikki's sister
<Chimera> Rofl simple wikipedia
<n2> you also create chaos in the world
<Chimera> Oh wow nice
<Chimera> .
<Chimera> Why
<eXAKR> Nah
<Chimera> Why would you create chaos
<Sakuya> Oh lolol
<n2> because you broke every single security protocol in the world?
<Sakuya> Class is over early
<eXAKR> they should give TREE(3) dollars
*eXAKR hides
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<n2> since they all are based on the same principle
<HyperMetalLugia> noooo
<Chimera> True
<Sakuya> Be back in about 40 minutes
<Chimera> K
<eXAKR> Math is really fun, eh
<n2> NO
*eXAKR hides under Graham's Number
<eXAKR> What n2
<Aristeo> o.o
*Quilava squeaks
<n2> math isnt one of my strong points
<PandaBlossom> i'm still on the phone with deadcrab
<Umbreon> 12hmm
*Umbreon gives eXAKR a Graham Cracker
<Chimera> Hm
<Chimera> In my book I'm going to make Ray the only person in the world who solved P=NP
*Chimera runs
<n2> but think of it this way, if you solve it
<n2> you can have free cable TV for life
<n2> *satellite
<eXAKR> Nah
<eXAKR> Million dollars isn't enough for me
<Chimera> That or he and a group of g33ks he hangs out with helped find it out, but they're msrt enough to know that releasing the answer would break socoety :3
<Chimera> Rofl
<Chimera> That'd be awesome
<Chimera> Well
<eXAKR> Though it could be enough for me to own a high-end computer for the rest of my life
<Chimera> If someone solves it but doesn't cash in
<eXAKR> Or live comfortable for quite a long time
<n2> the proof itself is worth more than a million dollars you know
<Chimera> Then they could be freaking awesome
<eXAKR> hmmm
<Chimera> Wait
<n2> since it could be used for decrypting encryption standards
<Chimera> If it's worth more than onr million dolars
<Chimera> *one
<Chimera> Why's it inly being priced as such?
<n2> and say..write your own root certificate so you have one that looks like it is citibank and signed by verisign
<Chimera> Only
<Chimera> Whoa
<n2> you could also imitate a US government NIPRNET connection
<Chimera> Or hacking every school computer in the country so we can all have MINECRAFT
*Chimera runs
<n2> or you could sign your own PS3 keys
<Chimera> Yes :3
<n2> if the other guys didnt beat you to it
<Chimera> Sony: NO TAMPERING WITH OUR PRODUCTS OR WE FORCE DOWNGRADE YOU
<n2> we trust encryption a lot in this world
<Chimera> AND SUE YOU
<Chimera> You: P=NP
<n2> and the fact that nobody knows how to factor a 32bit number
<Chimera> Sony: ;_;
<n2> quickly
<eXAKR> Ah
<eXAKR> I see it
<eXAKR> I SEE IT NAO
<Chimera> IT'S ALWAYS BEEN INSIDE OF ME
<eXAKR> THE WORLD WILL GO NUTS AS SOON IT'S PROVEN P=NP
<Chimera> ENDLESS PO-

<eXAKR> Indeed
<Creideiki> And as one of my profs joked.
<eXAKR> Sony: NO MESSING WITH OUR PS3s
<eXAKR> Us: Screw your encryption I have P=NP!
<Creideiki> "Some engineer somewhere probably has proved that P=NP. But the dumbass company is probably using it in a self-calibrating toaster."

<nickstr> sadly, this song does not have much truth anymore
<nickstr> and about the only AM station I listen to is well my own
<nickstr> you just can't hear music anymore
<Creideiki> You know what would be hilarious to broadcast on a loop?
<Creideiki> One of either:
<nickstr> its all political and religious talk
<Creideiki> 1. Any Grand Theft Auto radio station.
<Creideiki> 2. Enclave Radio from Fallout 3

<nickstr> oh gosh, this clip was because of me being something of a whistle blower
<nickstr> this came from me picking up the Accurian HD Radio from Radioshack back in December 2006
<nickstr> when I took my radio home and tuned it to a known AM stereo station which was CKMX 1060 Calgary something unbelievable happened
<nickstr> IT ACTUALLY DECODED THE STEREO SIGNAL!
<nickstr> after this remarkable discovery I posted it to a message board but sadly could not record what I heard due to lack of an audio cable
<nickstr> but another person who bought the same receiver confirmed it and provided a recording
<nickstr> which is the one I spammed earlier on
<junh1024-XD> your yellow in your spammer is slightly unreadable.
<nickstr> it depends on the display
<junh1024-XD> (on white background)
<nickstr> it is
<nickstr> but then again its not necessarily critical information
<junh1024-XD> ispz
<nickstr> that is why I picked yellow for that bit

<drf|laptop> 03hm
<nickstr> its not my decision
<nickstr> just do what you feel is right

<Ascendant> nice
<nickstr> the PSP version actually WILL run Windows 95 as well!
<nickstr> unfortunately you can't do squat with iDOS on any of the iOS devices
<nickstr> well in the case of Windows
<drf|laptop> 03I love when they advertise medicine and spend twice the time talking about the side effects than the actual stuff it does
<nickstr> and yet I got Windows 3.0, 3.11, and 95 to work on DOS Box PSP
<drf|laptop> 03:O DOSBox PSP?
<drf|laptop> 03I want to play Commander Keen on my PSP

<nickstr> then you can run it
<nickstr> I am running it on 5.00 m33-6
<nickstr> and could possibly provide my version of DOS Box complete with the DBS utility which allows for loading hard disk images
<drf|laptop> 03yeah mine is m33-6 too

*Ascendant lol'd
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Iskierka> no, Linux is not having sex at all :P
<HyperMetalLugia> So windows is better sex :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Linux has no gender :(
<Ascendant> XD
<Iskierka> actually, no, that's Mac
<Prince-dari> No one can do anything with your IP anyway.
<HyperMetalLugia> Macs do porn art
<Espeon> 06Oh no, are we here again
*HyperMetalLugia flees
<HyperMetalLugia> I know espeon
<HyperMetalLugia> Remember
<HyperMetalLugia> opinions != facts
<Iskierka> Linux is sex only you're a different species and can't transfer anything
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha, totally
<HyperMetalLugia> Oor..bestality
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<Armageddon> true
<Espeon> 06Because people making any kind of malware are just driven by the same urges as anyone just wanting others to be mad - they want to impact as many people as possible.
<Armageddon> Well, they can't do that much lol
<Espeon> 06We've been through it all before.
<Iskierka> they could easily make mac and linux users mad
<Espeon> 06People are a little bit too paranoid about their IP at times.
<Prince-dari> More like they want to get your money.
<Iskierka> or at least mac users, and they'd probably hit more
<Iskierka> since there's no protection
<Ascendant> lmfao
<HyperMetalLugia> Totally
<Espeon> 06Either way, they want to impact as many people as possible.
<Iskierka> linux would be harder due to the hundreds of distros to accomodate
<HyperMetalLugia> Armageddon, tell 4chan you iP
<HyperMetalLugia> Too many distros .c.
<Prince-dari> 4chan can't do anything either, lol.
<HyperMetalLugia> TO DESSERT
<Prince-dari> If they could I'd post up my school's IP address just for the lulz.
<Espeon> 06It just makes it even more amusing when those buttsore people go "finding your IP, good luck getting online/on xbox live/whatever tomorrow"
<Espeon> 06lol
<Prince-dari> The best someone said to me was "I've got your IP, I'm going to brick your router"
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> >get a new router
<Ascendant> seeya
<Prince-dari> To be fair I had to turn it off and on, but I think that was unrelated.
<Creideiki> My current point of view on Linux is: Why the <insert swearwords here> are you not working with my hardware you <insert swear words here>!
<Iskierka> because they don't test it with all hardware.
<Creideiki> No, it's because they can't be arsed to write drivers for it.
<Prince-dari> Anyone getting Skyrim when it comes out?
*Iskierka installed on a non-custom netbook and got a distro designed for that brand, only a few details not working
<Armageddon> maybe
<Prince-dari> Dragons. :D
<Creideiki> "Oh, your NIC doesn't work... get a new one." <-- Ummm... LOL no, I'd rather spend money on a new video card.
<Prince-dari> I find it funny that we got dragons on Oblivion with a mod before Bethesda actually put them into a game.
<Creideiki> Yes, I know NICs are cheap. But... not gigabit NICs.
<Creideiki> Also, again... I've noticed vaguely no gigabit NIC wishes to co-operate with Linux.
<Armageddon> XD
<Prince-dari> Also - mods on Oblivion for PS3 = Win :)
<Iskierka> my desktop has a gigabit network interface built in ... unless you want one with multiple ports or some other specialised feature
<Creideiki> My desktop also has (two) integrated gigabit NICs.
<Creideiki> Which - surprise, surprise - don't work in Linux.
<HyperMetalLugia> Such a shock ;o
<Iskierka> I see. Are PCI NICs significantly more expensive than (accounting for the obvious) the integrated ones?
<Creideiki> Yes... if you have to shell out money for PCIe because your only PCI slot is in use. :P
<Iskierka> heh
<HyperMetalLugia> I have 2 PCI ;3
<Armageddon> heya Skylands
<NightSeas> 12Hello Skylands!
<HyperMetalLugia> Or, mayybe 3 PCI in my desktop
<Creideiki> I have 1 PCI, and 5 PCIe. :P
<SilverSonic> SKY *GLOMP* :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Should be the other way around ;P
<SilverSonic> its glomp people day xD
<Creideiki> Linux also hates modems.
<SilverSonic> lol jk
<Espeon> 06~
<Espeon> 06It's actually Jolteon day
<Espeon> 06so suck it
<SilverSonic> ~ x2 2
<Creideiki> And I mean hates every modem.
<HyperMetalLugia> Linux = Francis
<Iskierka> I think I've got something on the lines of 1 PCI, 2 PCIe x16, and 1 PCIe x4 (or is the small type x8?)
<Creideiki> Unless you shell out an arm and a leg for one of the fully hardware modems... which are made only by USR, and which cost as much as a video card.
<HyperMetalLugia> Speaking of screwy modems
<HyperMetalLugia> I DCed again x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup 2 PCI and 1 PCIe
<HyperMetalLugia> MiniTowers FTW

<HyperMetalLugia> I hate mIRC
<HyperMetalLugia> Erm, my touchpad
<Creideiki> My next PC - which I'll probably get this summer I've already planned out.
<HyperMetalLugia> My old XPs 700 system has..
*HyperMetalLugia checks
<Iskierka> until I can reliably get a fair income I'll stick with very occasional improvements to my current rather than new PCs
<Creideiki> I found a wonderfully cheap rackmountable server case. :P
<Iskierka> and I'm not sure I'll really ever need to upgrade the RAM or CPU
<Creideiki> Which can have the rack mounting hardware removed while leaving the handles attached.
<Iskierka> well, maybe the RAM, but that's the easy of the two
<Creideiki> Therefore: Insta LANparty capable system. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm.. one PCieX1, two PCIe and three PCi
<SilverSonic> if it was Jolteon Day then RJ would be getting special attention XD
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't have any use for more than one PCie port, so I win 8D
<Creideiki> I'll have use for multiple PCIe ports with the new box. :P
<Iskierka> SLi is the use I'll have for it
<Creideiki> It's called QuadSLI. :P
<RedDragonX> College does that to you
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew SLi
<HyperMetalLugia> Since it's nvidia ;PO
<Iskierka> Quad lol, with what cards?
<Armageddon> ;o
<Espeon> 06It is.
<Iskierka> and shush, just cause you don't have epic powerful cards
<Creideiki> Damn... where's the list I made...
<HyperMetalLugia> And I don't game, so no use for anything
<Espeon> 06It IS Jolteon day.
<Armageddon> XD
<Creideiki> You know the only reason I'm getting multiple video cards for is to abuse them for high power computing reasons. :P
<Creideiki> If I had the bling I'd buy a tesla. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> My cute little low power HD4350 would work
<HyperMetalLugia> Loltesla, overkill
<Prince-dari> Ha, haven't seen you on in ages RDX.
<Iskierka> your HD4350 apparently gets less performance than my GeForce 8600 OC
<Ascendant> ew GeForce lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Derp >:D
<Creideiki> And if I had even more bling, I'd try and find an actual supercomputer to abuse. :P (Even though they basically want them GONE after about five years. :P )
<Ascendant> suuuupercomputers
<Ascendant> I WANT ONE
*Ascendant idles
<Creideiki> (They still need power and cooling up the yin yang. :P )
<HyperMetalLugia> Hahaah
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew Geforce period
<HyperMetalLugia> And when you play nothing more than old emulated games, your GPU power really doesn't mean anything
<HyperMetalLugia> (unless it is from 2003)
<Stormy> RDX keeps forgetting we exist
<Iskierka> too bad Creideiki is probably the only one here that would be able to use a supercomputer since you'd have to deal with entirely different architectures
<Iskierka> HML you were saying an emulated PS1 game lagged
<HyperMetalLugia> Crappy Laptop's the reason
<Prince-dari> Oh hey Stormy.
<HyperMetalLugia> 16bit <32
<Stormy> Hey
<HyperMetalLugia> Moreso the drivers x.x
<Iskierka> get new drivers
<HyperMetalLugia> Since the actual specs of the GPU here (intergrated into the CPU) are decent and are like my PC's
<HyperMetalLugia> Tried, didn't fix anything
<Armageddon> ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> And only supports DirectX10
<Iskierka> the very base specs of a GPU are fairly irrelevant. My 8600 isn't that far behind a GTX 580 in terms of the most basic numbers
<Iskierka> but in terms of actual game performance?
<Iskierka> pfft
<Iskierka> no comparison
<HyperMetalLugia> Well this isn't a gaming laptop you know :|
<HyperMetalLugia> (Which is another reason why I stick to consoles for gaming)_
<Prince-dari> PS3 for HD shaders on SNES! :)
<HyperMetalLugia> EW Ps3
<HyperMetalLugia> HD shaders for PS1 games i ePSXe ;P
<Iskierka> you stick to consoles that are decades out of date and easily emulated by new computers
<Aristeo> mmmmmmmmmmm taco bell
<HyperMetalLugia> Because it's fun
<Prince-dari> Lol, ePSXe is so crap.
<Jason> :O
<Jason> nom
<HyperMetalLugia> Works great for me ;P
<Iskierka> and while I agree Ew PS3 that's the only bad thing to the newest gen
<Prince-dari> I'd rather play my PS1 games on my PS2. :)
<HyperMetalLugia> ^Agreed
<HyperMetalLugia> But I don't have any of my old PS1 disks
<HyperMetalLugia> (Hence the reason for emulators)
<DeadCricket> chris wanna know their secret ingredient?
<DeadCricket> =P
<DeadCricket> it's soylent green
<DeadCricket> :P
<Jason> DeadCricket: you listening to the songg?
<Prince-dari> Anyway, PS3 became epic since geohot/fail0verflow hacks.
<HyperMetalLugia> And why have emulators when you have the actual consoles/carts?
<DeadCricket> not atm i'm streaming stuff about the quake and destruction in japan
<Jason> :(
<Iskierka> for convenience. And unless that's a hack to get back all the nice features they removed I don't see how it's that epic
<Jason> Thats so sad man
<Prince-dari> There is.
<DeadCricket> it's in my url catcher so i have the link
<Prince-dari> AbestOS
<HyperMetalLugia> Lung cancer
<Jason> They were one of my top 5 fave countries
<DeadCricket> i've got friends over there
<Jason> :O
<Prince-dari> You can even run XP/Vista/7 on PS3 now, I think.
<Jason> omg
<Prince-dari> Bit crappy though.
<Prince-dari> Only works well with really lightweight linux.
<HyperMetalLugia> I would think
<Iskierka> hrm, not bad then.
<Iskierka> still don't particularly like PS3 itself though
<HyperMetalLugia> Lightweight linux, I wonder
<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds like DOS
<Prince-dari> And anything that annoys Sony is good, since they seem to hate their customers so much. >_>
*Iskierka imagines Vista nomming all 256 MB of system memory rather easily
<HyperMetalLugia> Totally, the killed the PS3 x.x

<Prince-dari> So far they haven't issued any IP bans.
<Prince-dari> They've just been a bit of a fail.

<RedDragonX> and actually the episodes are 22 minute each

<eXAKR> I won't need words
<nickstr> these people are just ignorant
<nickstr> I don't feel that Japan deserved this
<nickstr> I don't feel like hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of people deserve to be homeless
<Presea> probably a bunch of middle schools who aren't aware of what's real or not
<Presea> schoolers*
<nickstr> it IS real
<Presea> ya but that doesn't seem to click for some ppl who constantly see things like this in games and media
<Presea> so they see it as some sick joke
<nickstr> that might be why
<Presea> my faith in ppl here and anywhere with alot of media is pretty low
<Presea> if someone is in an accident here
<Presea> and there's 40 ppl around
<nickstr> I have seen nature's fury first hand
<Presea> NOT ONE will help them

<Presea> they'll just stand there Maybe
<nickstr> tornados, severe thunderstorms, and yes even earthquakes
<Presea> or just keep walking
<Presea> i've seen them as well
<Presea> but nothing compares to japan
<Presea> for me
<nickstr> the devastation Sendai saw echos that of what happened to New Orleans in 2004
<Presea> you have to realize how many ppl are on that island country
<Presea> packed together
<nickstr> millions
<Presea> ya
<Presea> so you've seen nothing like what they went through
<Presea> you can compare something similar to it
<Presea> but when it gets down to the math..
<Presea> on how many lives are effected
<nickstr> I was comparing the destruction largely but good point
<Presea> even if the aftershocks stop, and the nuclear plant doesn't explode
*Aristeo yawns
<Presea> the long term effects are going to be Bad
<nickstr> there already was an explosion
<Presea> ya
<Presea> from pressure buildup
<nickstr> but it was NOT like Chernobyl
<Presea> but not a meltdown from what i heard
<nickstr> a huge portion of Japan will not be uninhabitable
<nickstr> the reactors are light water and of a very modern design
<Presea> ogod
<nickstr> certainly speaks volumes of Japanese engineering
<Presea> ya and atm they're using sea water to cool the reactor
<Presea> >.>
<Presea> which is good but tells you their situation isn't
<nickstr> they are in a pinch and I am sure it will have at least some effect
<eXAKR> I hope all nuclear power plants in the U.S. go boom
<eXAKR> That will teach them
<Presea> teach them what?
<Presea> they'll be dead
<Presea> want 250 million dead?
<nickstr> I hope Singapore suffers a tsunami and gets destroyed completely
<Presea> do ya?
<nickstr> how does THAT feel eXAKR?

<Ascendant> lol I get called a jerk
<Ascendant> but it's not like I even care

<Ascendant> [19:21:05] <drfsupercenter> back in middle school I got bullied so much for liking Pokémon that I'd come home from school in tears half hte time
<drfsupercenter> 03and now I basically never get offended
<Ascendant> I got bullied for being who I am
<drfsupercenter> 03unless people constantly call me gay
<drfsupercenter> 03THEN I get annoyed
<drfsupercenter> 03because I'm not, and I can prove it LOL
<Ascendant> and my mum used to abuse me
<drfsupercenter> 03but other than that, call me a jerk or whatever all you want, I don't care
<Ascendant> and throw insults (still does)

<Ascendant> and Shiny rages at me for it
*Ascendant hides
<Presea> it's probably been a long time since i was as you refer to as "corrupted"
<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> well, it's bound to happen
<Ascendant> why not earlier than later
<Presea> then again i visit 2chan more then 4chan
<Ascendant> lol 2chan
<Drake> 04You're only corrupted if you were once innocent.
<Presea> innocent
<Ascendant> yeah Drake
<Ascendant> I was a cute little Nightshadow once upon a time

<Ascendant> hang on
<Presea> in like.. 02-03
<Presea> i can't exactly remember much from that time
<Ascendant> xD
<Presea> other then that i was in a channel full of random users
<Ascendant> I joined in like
<Ascendant> 2008
<Presea> and they were awesome
<Ascendant> or 2009
<Presea> it was as if they were all hyper non-stop

<eXAKR> oh damn
<Ascendant> heya eXAKR
<eXAKR> News from Japan gets worse
<Ascendant> o-o
<Presea> what happened now
<Presea> o_o
<eXAKR> My dad came home with a copy of the local paper
<eXAKR> On the front page
<eXAKR> 80,000 people missing, feared dead
<Presea> i thought so
<eXAKR> 2000 dead, 1000 injured
<Ascendant> o-o
<Ascendant> woah
<Presea> you see 4 entire trains went missing
<eXAKR> 2 major cities in Japan flooded
<Presea> and they were loaded with ppl
<Presea> and those boats and cars you see
<eXAKR> I saw
<Presea> also had ppl
<Presea> so i Knew they're guess of 1000 ppl had to be wrong
<nickstr> so 100,000 missing and possibly dead was perhaps a reasonable guess
<Presea> their*
<eXAKR> Also
<eXAKR> Newest estimates puts quake at magnitude 9
<nickstr> holy cow
<eXAKR> 180 people irradiated in the vinicity of nuclear power plant
<Ascendant> o-o
<nickstr> I guess the iodine supliments were mentioned already
<Ascendant> HAARP
<nickstr> they were from the news sources here in the US
<nickstr> I find that bogus
<nickstr> HAARP in no way could be involved
<eXAKR> I'm just reposting everything that was just on the front page of this Chinese evening paper
<eXAKR> And just the front page
<eXAKR> Holy cow
<nickstr> the situation there just seems to be getting worse and worse
<eXAKR> missiles belonging to Japan SDF missing as a result of quake and tsunami
<Presea> so..
<Presea> there's missing missiles
<Presea> just out there
<Presea> in the piles of stuff
<Presea> that could get set off?
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> it seems to be getting worse and worse
<nickstr> just as I said
<Presea> i'd have to say
<Presea> so
<nickstr> I am sure Japan will be able to recover
<nickstr> but it will take years
<Presea> in a few decades
<Presea> their economy was already bad before this happened
<eXAKR> release of movie about Tangshan earthquake in China delayed indefinitely
<eXAKR> in Japanese theatres
<Presea> i think anything related to quakes is going to be put on hold
<Presea> i recall watching an anime which was more of a japanese PSA about large quakes
<Presea> the anime came out in like 2004
<Presea> yet even with the details of the risk
<Presea> they didn't or couldn't do much
<Presea> about it
<nickstr> from what I heard a Pokemon episode was never aired due to earthquakes
<nickstr> and never will be
<nickstr> so both original series and Advanced Generation have lost episodes
<Presea> ya
<nickstr> well not really for original series
<Presea> heh speaking of which there was a rumor going around the maker of pokemon died, but it's false
<Presea> i wonder who comes up with these ideas
<Presea> :<
<Ascendant> o-o
<nickstr> Electric Solder Porygon survives on home recorded VHS tapes
<Ascendant> probably some random fgt
<Presea> tracked him down to some twitter account where he reported he was glad to finally make it home
<Presea> >.>
<Presea> apparently alot of devs in japan use twitter
<Ascendant> ew
<Presea> ya ew
<Presea> but anyways i also read that nintendo reported that it was unphased by the quake and that it was "hardly the time to be thinking about video games"
<nickstr> I thought the Satoshi Tajiri rumor was false
<nickstr> I heard about it yesterday
<Presea> ya
<Presea> quite a few companys have shutdown factorys in japan
<Presea> even some that weren't directly effected by the quake
<nickstr> I am not surprised
<nickstr> a number of people even in Tokyo could very well have family members in the effected areas
<nickstr> its a safe bet
<Presea> ya
<nickstr> it seems like the right thing to do
<nickstr> especially given how many are missing

<drfsupercenter> 03I have a level 39 Growlithe
<drfsupercenter> 03it just learned Flamethrower
<drfsupercenter> 03I want to evolve into Arcanine but then it won't learn any new moves.
<drfsupercenter> 03according to bulbapedia, the only actually useful moves it learns after that are Heat Wave and Flare Blitz
<drfsupercenter> 03Flare Blitz does recoil damage so no.
<drfsupercenter> 03but Heat Wave... apparently is a special attack that does 100 damage?
<Light_Latias> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't know if it's worth waiting until level 51
<drfsupercenter> 03to learn it
<Quanyails> 7Well, it hits multiple enemies.
<drfsupercenter> 03well, at 45 it learns Crunch which seems nice XD
<drfsupercenter> 03it doesn't hit the allies though?
<Light_Latias> doesnt it lower stats/

<eXAKR> http://news.uk.msn.com/photos/special-photo-galleries/photos.aspx?cp-documentid=156477704&page=12 <- OMG
<eXAKR> Really touching
<lightumbreon> wow, i even let a tear
<lightumbreon> lucky, reaaally lucky
<eXAKR> It's really images like this that touch my heart
<lightumbreon> yea.....they can't stop talking about it at school
<eXAKR> It's big
<lightumbreon> i know
<eXAKR> News bulletins are dedicating a large portion of time to it
<eXAKR> splashed on front pages of newspapers everywhere
<eXAKR> Every forum I know of have a topic at least on this
<eXAKR> OK
<eXAKR> I was saying earlier
<eXAKR> The only way the carnage in Japan can top car, bus, and house on roof could be ship on roof
<eXAKR> http://estb.msn.com/i/68/4128EB7453F999EE73676354F5628.jpg
<eXAKR> Respect nature, people.
<eXAKR> http://sisinmaru.blog17.fc2.com/ <- And now, maybe something to make you smile
<lightumbreon> yay! kitty!
<eXAKR> http://www.iris.edu/edu/10.5/EQSimulator.html <- This. Is. So. Wrong.
<eXAKR> "It is not beyond possibility that a massive earthquake of magnitude 10.0 ( 10 )or 10.1 on the Richter scale could be produced on the planet, in extreme circumstances. This level of quake would cause damage to the earth's crust on a truly global scale, with the fault line likely to circle a large part of the planet, causing massive destruction on many continents and probably unbelievably
<eXAKR> high death tolls - although, by contrast, the energy produced by such an earthquake as this is only a tiny fraction of the energy the earth receives every day from the sun in the form of light and heat! Try the "Earthquake Simulator" to see what it might take to produce a "Mega-Quake" here"
<eXAKR> If a magnitude 10 quake occurs the earth will literally crack apart
<eXAKR> 9 = what's happening in Japan right now
<eXAKR> 9.4 = Sumatra, Indonesia
<eXAKR> *9.3
<eXAKR> Most powerful earthquake was 9.5
<eXAKR> In Chile, 1960
<eXAKR> Interesting
<eXAKR> 1952, there was a 9.0 quake in Kamchatka, far east Russia
<eXAKR> 1957, Andreanof quake in Alaska, U.S. was 8.6
<lightumbreon|UT2004> ouch
<eXAKR> 1960, Valdivia quake in Chile was 9.5 (worst ever)
<Iskierka> Japan's quake is, I believe, the largest near a densely populated area and/or several nuclear power stations
<eXAKR> 1963, Kuril Islands in Russia far east had a 8.5
<eXAKR> 1964, Alaska had another, on 9.2
<lightumbreon> yea, there are big areas under nuclear radiation, poor bastards
<eXAKR> Then Rat Islands in Alaska got another at 8.7
<Iskierka> lightumbreon, most people don't appreciate being called bastards, ahem.
<eXAKR> Seems like the strong quakes happen together in a few years
<lightumbreon> agreed, pardon me
<eXAKR> There's definitely a relation
<eXAKR> And this is definitely not a sign of the End of the World
<lightumbreon> no, i hope not
<eXAKR> Just look at 1957-1965
<lightumbreon> too less evidence for the end
<HyperMetalLugia> LU you retard
<Iskierka> it's possible that large quakes in areas of the world could loosen the plates to allow for other strong events elsewhere
*HyperMetalLugia shuns .v.
<eXAKR> 2004, Sumatra in Indonesia got a 9.1, and we all knew what happened >>
<lightumbreon> i know HML, i am a retard, deal with it
*lightumbreon puts on glasses
<eXAKR> Then a year later they got an 8.6
<eXAKR> 2 years later an 8.7 in the same place again
<eXAKR> Last year in Chile there was an 8.8
<Iskierka> I think the prediction that japan would face a ~8.0 quake soon was based on the general frequency Japan usually sees rather than that there were quakes nearby
<eXAKR> And now in Japan we have a 9
<lightumbreon> ouch, what was the beginning? what coused it?
<eXAKR> I could rather point out the fact that strong quakes seem to "cluster" around a period of years
<Iskierka> <Iskierka> it's possible that large quakes in areas of the world could loosen the plates to allow for other strong events elsewhere
<lightumbreon> good one Iskierka!

<eXAKR> Yes, that
<lightumbreon> we have This earthquake tommorow as subject on geology, i will metion that quote
<eXAKR> Notice that they happen in the same general region as well
<Iskierka> one disturbance helps shift the others along, until before long all the energy is released. At that point no more quakes are able to happen, so they settle down and start building up again, until one gives way and fires the others
<eXAKR> the 1957-1965 seems concentrated to Alaska
<eXAKR> This one is on Sumatra
<eXAKR> Iskierka › one disturbance helps shift the others along, until before long all the energy is released. At that point no more quakes are able to happen, so they settle down and start building up again, until one gives way and fires the others <- Yes yes yes
<Iskierka> the fact they're in the same region is more just that those regions have high tectonic activity, making them quake-prone in general
<eXAKR> So Alaska and Sumatra is quake prone.
<eXAKR> AVOID.
*eXAKR hides
<eXAKR> But yeah, you nailed it
<lightumbreon> that joke would be funny if this didn't happen eXAKR
<eXAKR> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes#Largest_earthquakes_by_magnitude
*eXAKR slaps himself around a bit with a large trout
<eXAKR> Unfunny joke punishment
<lightumbreon> right
<eXAKR> Anyway, look at that likst
<eXAKR> *list
<lightumbreon> wow, a magnitude 9.5?
<lightumbreon> now i was thinking about the move from Camperut, magnitude.....i think they made that one purpose
<lightumbreon> or earthquake
<eXAKR> I see mostly Chile and nearby, Russia far east, Alaska, and Sumatra in Indonesia on there
*eXAKR forces lightumbreon to eat the cyanide sandwich
<eXAKR> You know
<eXAKR> After the India Ocean Tsunami
<eXAKR> Whenever I play Pokémon
<eXAKR> And one of them goes
<eXAKR> "Magnitude 9!"
<eXAKR> on my Pokémon
<lightumbreon> ....that move is actually awefull in combination with this
<eXAKR> I think, "THIS IS SO WRONG"
*lightumbreon hides
<eXAKR> eXAKR › I see mostly Chile and nearby, Russia far east, Alaska, and Sumatra in Indonesia on there <- Pacific Ring of Fire places, too
<eXAKR> (going back to topic)
<lightumbreon> mmm, what would happen if a magnitude 9 Earthquake would hit the area of the Pacific Ring of Fire?
<lightumbreon> that wouldn't be too nice after all
<eXAKR> That already happened
<eXAKR> Indonesia in 2004, Japan now
<lightumbreon> oh
<lightumbreon> ah, yes, i suck at geography
<eXAKR> Though it is VERY unlikely that the whole thing will go trembling at the same time
<eXAKR> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_ring_of_fire
<eXAKR> Jolts here and there along the ring every now and then, but never all at the same time
<lightumbreon> yea, that would be VERY unlikely
<eXAKR> (it could hypothetically, but only in really extreme circumstances)
<eXAKR> One quake along it could trigger another later on
<eXAKR> But they will never go shaking at the same time
<lightumbreon> mmm, a chain reaction could be possibele, but as you said, NEVER at the same time
<lightumbreon> or atleats, VERY unlikely
<Iskierka> we do see chain reactions, but because of the stupidly huge scale we're talking about, the subsequent quake can take 1-3 years to occur
<eXAKR> "It is not beyond possibility that a massive earthquake of magnitude 10.0 ( 10 )or 10.1 on the Richter scale could be produced on the planet, in extreme circumstances. This level of quake would cause damage to the earth's crust on a truly global scale, with the fault line likely to circle a large part of the planet, causing massive destruction on many continents and probably unbelievably

Try the "Earthquake Simulator" to see what it might take to produce a "Mega-Quake" here"
<lightumbreon> ahw, that would be HORRIBLE
<Iskierka> each quake just loosens the plates so that the next quake will happen in a few years, rather than a few decades
<lightumbreon> so we are talking about a domino effect? eventually?
<eXAKR> http://www.iris.edu/edu/10.5/EQSimulator.html <- Max out everything, read the text, and then press create earthquake for a bit of a primere
<eXAKR> -e
<eXAKR> On why such strong earthquakes are near impossible
<Iskierka> note that if the number on the richter scale increases by 1, the strength of the quake increases by ten - a 10.1 would be approaching twenty times more powerful than the one Japan just got hit by (8.9)
<eXAKR> It's a scale that goes 1 10 100 1000 10000 etc., I know
<eXAKR> logametric
<Iskierka> a 35km depth quake would have to shift a 40,000 km fault by 350 metres to create a magnitude 10.7. Holy hell.
<eXAKR> lightumbreon › so we are talking about a domino effect? eventually? <- It had already started, yes
<lightumbreon> ouch, i'm gonna bring this whole toopic up on class tommorrow
<lightumbreon> where gonna discuss it
<Iskierka> a quake of 10+ magnitude is exceedingly unlikely
<eXAKR> eXAKR › logametric <- *logarithmic
<eXAKR> indeed
<eXAKR> The death toll from such a quake could be in billions
<eXAKR> frightening
<Iskierka> billions is highly unlikely, but millions is almost definite
<Iskierka> you can basically write off anyone who lives on a coast
<Iskierka> plus holland
<eXAKR> That means I'm included
<eXAKR> Since I'm pretty near a coast
<Iskierka> how elevated is singapore? you might get away by tsunamis not making it up if you're lucky
<eXAKR> From here it's a 20-minute bucycle ride or a 10-minute bus ride to the shore
<eXAKR> Iskierka › how elevated is singapore? you might get away by tsunamis not making it up if you're lucky <- 164 metres is the highest point
<eXAKR> our tallest skyscraper goes up to 280 metres though
<eXAKR> Most residential apartment blocks are much shorter
<Iskierka> tsunamis over 30m are unlikely, so if you can run uphill quickly ...
<lightumbreon> i don't live near the coast, around 200KM from it
<eXAKR> Mine is 16 floors
<eXAKR> The highest is 50 floors
<eXAKR> Most here are around 12-20 floors
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<lightumbreon> it would be rather unlikely to have a tsunami that high and no one would be evacuated
<eXAKR> I live on the second floor, but if I could run up fast
<Iskierka> so most would be high enough, if they could withstand the impact
<lightumbreon> lol, better start trainign then
<Iskierka> that much water is going to carry quite a punch
<eXAKR> Maybe I could get to the higher floors of my block in time, then maybe yes
<eXAKR> Well, I have seen a video of the tsunami in Japan
<eXAKR> it doesn't come all straight away in a wall of water
<lightumbreon> i think i don't want to know
<eXAKR> It's more like, a bit, then a lot, then HOLY SHEET THE BOATS AND HOUSES ARE MOVING
<lightumbreon> yea.....
<eXAKR> Scary
<lightumbreon> i would cr*p my pants if i saw it
<Iskierka> at the very coast I believe tsunamis do tend to have the wall-behaviour
<eXAKR> I think the fact that there wasn't so much water at first might had made some people complacent, sadly
<Iskierka> it's resistance from land that stops them
<Iskierka> well, slows
<eXAKR> But when tsunamis come, the best thing is to run straight away for higher ground
<Iskierka> they keep going a looooong way
<eXAKR> you never know how bad it could get until the whole thing comes in
<Iskierka> also the larger a tsunami it is the more it tends towards being a wall of water
<Iskierka> if it's low, it tends to be little impact but a lot of water dragged a long
<Iskierka> high ones are *smash* followed by a comparable amount of water
<eXAKR> The first warning sign of a tsunami is the water retreating very far out
<lightumbreon> so, are there anymore "waves" incoming in the Red Zones?
<eXAKR> One girl saved lots of lives when she recognised that and got everybody to flee during the 2004 tsunami
<eXAKR> At the end of the day, when you think about it
<eXAKR> This isn't 2012 or End of The World
<lightumbreon> no, never
<eXAKR> The carnage is especially bad here because lots of people + nuclear power plants
<eXAKR> If this happened in a place with nobody no one could have cared
<eXAKR> The problem is that this happened in a place with millions of people
<eXAKR> And nuclear power plants
<lightumbreon> yea, the Nuclear Powerplants screw things up pretty easly
<lightumbreon> all the radiation coming from it....
<lightumbreon> did the japaneese not lear how killing radiation is?
<lightumbreon> referring to the terrorism attack on Hirishima of course
<eXAKR> well, when they need energy, screw everything else
<eXAKR> Unfortunately
<lightumbreon> yea, but still, nuclear radiation is NOT funny
<eXAKR> Here in Singapore there was talk of setting up a nuclear power plant D:
<lightumbreon> oh, what a bummer
<Iskierka> nuclear power is the cleanest we have when there isn't a leak
<eXAKR> Now that this happened, people are saying "better think twice"
<Iskierka> by quite a way
<eXAKR> Thanks, but I prefer solar
<lightumbreon> we have a Solar boiler
<eXAKR> They should really spend money and research on that
<Iskierka> modern reactor designs wouldn't be vulnerable to what went wrong in Japan
<Iskierka> and solar power is painfully inefficient
<eXAKR> make better solar panels, set up more solar power plants
<eXAKR> Iskierka: that's why I say research
<eXAKR> I hope in the mid-term there can be a breakthrough on that
<lightumbreon> yea, that would be ALOT better for the economy and enviorment
<eXAKR> so instead of <48% (often much lower) we are getting now it will be closer to 70%
*eXAKR hugs his solar keyboard from Logitech
<Iskierka> eXAKR, there's a physical limit on what you can get from solar. To match a typical nuclear station, at say, 3 GW output, you would need at the very least, a 1 km by 3 km area devoted to collection
<Iskierka> and that's 3 GW at peak output, midday
<Iskierka> not averaged over the day
<Iskierka> also area is assuming it's built directly on the equator
<eXAKR> We ARE near the equator
<eXAKR> the problem: we have no land
<Iskierka> but most aren't
<eXAKR> hmmm.
<eXAKR> As I said, research research research
<Iskierka> at 45 degrees latitude, which is approx. where much of the population is, you'd need 1.4 times more area on one of the axes
<Iskierka> eXAKR, this is a limit defined by how much light energy we're actually receiving
<Iskierka> it is not physically possible to get more
<eXAKR> Still
<eXAKR> The problem is we are NOT tapping into it
<eXAKR> We should try tapping into it first before we start going nuclear
<Iskierka> because it requires ridiculous land areas compared to small nuclear power stations and ends up more expensive
<eXAKR> At least we can say we tried better alternatives
<Iskierka> solar requires far more maintenance. And nuclear is not worse, so long as it is well-maintained. The UK has only had two nuclear accidents, only one serious, and that was at the very start of the nuclear age
<Iskierka> 1957 at Sellafield
<Iskierka> 33 resulted deaths from a fire on a plutonium fire, which isn't bad considering just what the event was
<Iskierka> *plutonium pile
<Iskierka> and, like I said, modern reactors are not vulnerable to what Japan is now suffering
<Iskierka> the new designs are failsafe, if there's a power failure, all rods are dropped directly into heavy absorbant to shut off the reaction
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> I do wonder if accidents have happened at solar power plants
<eXAKR> But still, I'm not convinced
<eXAKR> the radiation is just no good
<Iskierka> the best idea we could put research into now is fusion. Totally failsafe purely by nature, as it needs ridiculous energy -input- to run - if there's a failure, it simply can't continue
<lightumbreon> agreed, i've read that they can generate electricity for a small lamp from a plant
<eXAKR> Still I say
<eXAKR> Maybe in the long run, just maybe
<Iskierka> the radiation experienced by the average nuclear plant worker is well below the healthy limit, so assuming nothing goes wrong - which is, again, near impossible in modern designs - the radiation is not a problem
<eXAKR> We may have to concentrate on both areas, but I still say solar first
<eXAKR> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_debate <- reading this now
<Iskierka> 48% of radiation dosage in the UK comes from radon and other radioactive gasses leaking from the crust, less than 10% is from nuclear plants and weapons combined
<spyro17> hello
<lightumbreon> weapons? you're kidding right?
<Iskierka> residual radiation from previously detonated weapons is present all over the world
<lightumbreon|nomming> oh, golly, mor Gorge Bush stuff
<lightumbreon|nomming> well, BRB
<Iskierka> I'm not sure the US detonated any weapons during George Bush's reign. And I think that Russia may have made more test-detonations
<Iskierka> Over its history as a nuclear test site, Novaya Zemlya hosted 224 nuclear detonations with a total explosive energy equivalent to 265 megatons of TNT.[17] For comparison, all explosives used in World War II, including the detonations of two U.S. nuclear bombs, amounted to only two megatons.[19]
<Iskierka> nice.
<Iskierka> that island also still has almost 3,000 people living on it, so radiation can't be that much risk
<eXAKR> But are they still living healthily, or...?
<eXAKR> (!!)
<Iskierka> they're living healthily enough, yes.
<Iskierka> Its seismic body wave magnitude was about 5 to 5.25.[6] The energy yield was around 7.1 on the Richter scale but, since the bomb was detonated in air rather than underground, most of the energy was not converted to seismic waves. <-- not strictly relevant but a fun fact about the Tsar Bomb
<eXAKR> "By contrast, coal plants create nearly a million tons of waste per day and release more total radioactivity than nuclear plants, due to the uranium and thorium found naturally within the coal." <<- Oh?
<Iskierka> harr.
*Iskierka can believe that, actually
<eXAKR> I'm still not totally convinced, though I think it may have a place in our future energy production
<eXAKR> I still think solar is the best way to go
<eXAKR> If not for main energy generation, then as a supplement to nuclear
<eXAKR> But if anything like this happens -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fukushima_explosion.jpg
<eXAKR> Boom.
<Iskierka> that was an explosion unrelated to the reactor, though it's feasible the reactor may have provided the heat to trigger it
<eXAKR> Yeah, but still worrying
<eXAKR> And that definitely won't make people worry less
<Iskierka> it's possible new designs could cause something similar but they will start cooling down very quickly by comparison and won't have much chance to
<Iskierka> explosions like that are a risk at any plant
<HyperMetalLugia> nukes .m.
<Iskierka> also give me a few moments, I want to try make a fun little calculation
<HyperMetalLugia> trolol
<Iskierka> a solar plant 1 kilometre wide, powering the entire earth (based on the energy consumption of 2008), would be 15,000 km in length
<lightumbreon> lol
<Iskierka> assuming 100% efficiency
<Iskierka> possibly slightly longer, given I'm assuming 1 KW/m^2 and it's actually slightly less, I believe
<Iskierka> (if you go looking for solar intensity you'll get values from 1.3 to 1.4 because that's if you don't account for atmosphere)
<lightumbreon> eya ecco
<EccoCode> hey lightumbreon
<lightumbreon> whats up?
<EccoCode> just woke up from a nap
<lightumbreon> always nice eh/ an afternoon nap?
<EccoCode> I don't noramlly take naps actually, I've caught a cold so after my two morning classes, I slept from about 10:30 to now, which is 1:20 PM now, xP

<drfsupercenter> 03-m
<Umbreon> 12yes
<drfsupercenter> 03OK well
<drfsupercenter> 03when you use the EXP Share
<drfsupercenter> 03does the other Pokémon get the same EVs you do?
<drfsupercenter> 03or do they just get none
<Light_Latias> it goes
<Umbreon> 12they get teh same evs
<Umbreon> 12*the
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03so it won't ultimitely make them weaker than leveling them up individually?
<Umbreon> 12unless the pokemon with exp share has pokerus
<drfsupercenter> 03because I noticed my Staryu has really crap values
<drfsupercenter> 03and I leveled that thing up a lot with the EXP share
<Umbreon> 12i don't think the battling pokemon having pokerus makes a difference
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think any of mine have it
<Umbreon> 12it's not an easy disease to find
<Umbreon> 12the only reason i ever got it was because i pokesaved a pokemon to have it

<Chimera> 04Hi
<Chimera> 04:D
<SilverSonic> in a specific folder
<drfsupercenter> 03SilverSonic, you should get JDownloader
<drfsupercenter> 03it lets you queue downloads
<SilverSonic> well, firefox queues them as well
<lightumbreon> or a external harddrive from 4TB, may come in handy with such a libary
<NightSeas> 12Norton won't let me download most things
<lightumbreon> thats stupid, go with NOD32
<NightSeas> 12It keeps my computer safe though o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03EW NORTON
<lightumbreon> and thats the meaning though?
<drfsupercenter> 03get rid of that crap and get a real antivirus

<drfsupercenter> 03you still using that CPU I sent you?
<lightumbreon> euw, dell D:
<Vaporeon> yes
<drfsupercenter> 03MSI Makes even better laptops :P
<Chimera> 04What CPU? o.o
<Vaporeon> i've considered replacing it though
<Chimera> 04You mean the one you suggested?
<drfsupercenter> 03I gave him my laptop's old Core 2 Duo
<Chimera> 04oh
<Chimera> 04k
<Vaporeon> chimera, he literally sent it to me
<Vaporeon> fU:
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<NightSeas> 12What's wrong with dell?
<drfsupercenter> 03same stuff that's wrong with Apple
<drfsupercenter> 03overpriced crap
<drfsupercenter> 03emphasis on crap
<Vaporeon> not mine
<lightumbreon> agreed
<Vaporeon> mine wasn't overpriced B)
<drfsupercenter> 03well you got lucky LOL
<NightSeas> 12I plan on getting a gateway myself
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Gateway
<drfsupercenter> 03dude, just build your own
<drfsupercenter> 03trust me, it'll be so much better
<Vaporeon> gateway is worse than dell
<Vaporeon> also building your own laptop sucks
<lightumbreon> get Asus
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate prebuilt computers, I'm never gonna buy one again
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<Vaporeon> i mean it's easy etc.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm talking about desktops
<Vaporeon> oh desktops yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03my laptop is custom built but it wasn't put together by me
<drfsupercenter> 03I paid for a place to do it XZD
<drfsupercenter> 03*XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well, it was a MSI retailer
<drfsupercenter> 03that built laptops
<drfsupercenter> 03so I just told them what I wanted
<NightSeas> 12Well, I plan on getting an all in one desktop :P
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Vaporeon> i really want my cart from newegg
<drfsupercenter> 03still, build your own desktop
<Vaporeon> complete, pretty good computer for $600
<drfsupercenter> 03is it one of those BYOS bundles?
<Vaporeon> a what
<Vaporeon> it's a combo deal thing
<NightSeas> 12Was considering building my own desktop, but it seems so complicated
<Vaporeon> it comes with everything except video card
<Vaporeon> and actually
<lightumbreon> mine pre build was 13-14.000 Euro's
<lightumbreon> it's a nice one
<Vaporeon> if it didn't have the video card and screen it'd be $350
<drfsupercenter> 03Vaporeon, Build Your Own System

<Vaporeon> oh
<Vaporeon> cool
<Ascendant> derp
<HyperMetalLugia> Trololwhat O.o
<Vaporeon> i don't see any of them as being particularly qualified, and that also goes for myself
<Vaporeon> i'd abuse the hell out of it
<Ascendant> I just don't care enough to try to get staff lol
<Vaporeon> only place i'm staff of is GG2 and that's hardly applicable because i'm mod of the worst forum
<Ascendant> I like being a normal user, lol
<Vaporeon> yeah that too
<Vaporeon> being staff comes with responisibilities and people look at you differently etc.
<Vaporeon> that hasn't happened at GG2 for me because the forum I'm mod of has almost no activity
<Espeon> 06Sometimes even in ways that makes no sense.
<Espeon> 06"You're a mod, no fun allowed"
<Espeon> 06And such
<Ascendant> lol you'd be surprised at how often that's emphasized
<Ascendant> while not entirely true there ARE limits to the "types" of fun you can have imo
<Ascendant> if you still want to remain true to your role
<Vaporeon> the only fun that's possible is abuse and of course that gets you demodded
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> /gzline *
<Vaporeon> unless it's GG2
<Ascendant> not like it's possible
<Ascendant> but you know what I mean
<Vaporeon> that reminds me
<Vaporeon> the ball's stuck in GC
<Espeon> 06Well, power abuse isn't exactly "fun" - so that shouldn't be a problem to differ from fun =P
<Ascendant> derp
<Vaporeon> as long as the abuse is harmless it's okay enough
<Vaporeon> some abuse can be fun
<Ascendant> and as long as it doesn't affect anyone else really
<Vaporeon> anyone that isn't okay with it
<Ascendant> pretty much
<Vaporeon> but then there will be people who get butthurt and go like "gomg aboos"
<Espeon> 06What both said.
<Espeon> 06But if someone doesn't want -any- part of it it's both immature and just stupid to do "small harmless things" involving them either way.
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Espeon> 06Not everyone likes being kicked just for zomgRandum xDD~
<Ascendant> "random"
<Vaporeon> and spam is something that not everyone likes

<Espeon> 06o.o
<Soyuz> Spend so much time here yet claim little activity
<Typhlosion> Well
<Typhlosion> HEll
<Typhlosion> There are 36 people online right now
<HyperMetalLugia> Erm
<HyperMetalLugia> Less
<HyperMetalLugia> Due to bouncers
<Typhlosion> Ah

<Espeon> 06..
<Espeon> 06yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> nii
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> Typhlosion, the forums are childsafe/SFW/whatever, the IRC isn't so much
<Typhlosion> >:|
<Armageddon> and right now I'd say there's around 33 people on
<Typhlosion> This does not amuse me
<HyperMetalLugia> And 5 who aren't idle
<Armageddon> and the chat is active, the forums are not x.x
<Typhlosion> Okay then
*Prince-dari is the idle king.
<Armageddon> lol
<Armageddon> ohai Prince-dari
<HyperMetalLugia> oHAI
<Typhlosion> Why don't you make the IRC network the main focus?
<HyperMetalLugia> !dari
<Armageddon> nah, Altair idles like a boss
<HyperMetalLugia> He reminds me of spicy chips
<Typhlosion> Since, Forums are slow, and people like IRC Better
<Armageddon> Well primarily, the site is what Ho-Oh's Realm is
<Typhlosion> And, also NSFE
<Typhlosion> *NSFW
<Armageddon> the IRC is a service/extension of it basically
<Prince-dari> Not Safe For Eccentrics
<Soyuz> that and, if you have a forum with no activity
<Soyuz> Well don't you suck then?
<Prince-dari> Procrastination should seriously go die in a hole. >_>
<Armageddon> lol procrastination
<Armageddon> doing it now
<Prince-dari> Same.
<SilverSonic> lolol
*Soyuz tosses Armageddon is a hole
<SilverSonic> o;
<Soyuz> *in
<Caaz> I was supposed to be doing things... two months ago
<Caaz> NO ONE PROCRASTINATES LIKE ME
<Soyuz> ohyeah?
<Soyuz> I was procrasinating on my fanfiction for 4 months
<Typhlosion> No
<Soyuz> beat that bitch
<Typhlosion> If you have a forum with no activity
<Armageddon> xD
<Typhlosion> And, an IRC network with tons of activity
<Soyuz> Then we blame Armageddon
<Caaz> Lol.
<Typhlosion> You're not a website from 20 years ago >:/
<Armageddon> ._.
<Armageddon> we're like
<Armageddon> 1 and a half years old
<Soyuz> toddler
<Typhlosion> Exactly
<Armageddon> xD
<Soyuz> INFANT
<Typhlosion> Stop being so Web 1.0
<Armageddon> xD
<Soyuz> So does that mean
<Armageddon> well the funny thing is
<Armageddon> HoR is literally divided into the site and IRC
<Soyuz> the website accidently shits its self?
<Typhlosion> Forums are for techinical support, and asking stupid questions
<Prince-dari> proheristation - I've decided that means to put off until yesterday.
<Armageddon> the site is very different to the IRC
<Armageddon> and is almost sort of run by different people
<Armageddon> Sneas, Altair and I run the IRC
<Typhlosion> Prince-dari, Eucrastination
<Soyuz> I don't know if it is hilarious or completely ironic Armageddon says this
<Armageddon> Shiny-Ho-Oh (HoR's founder) runs the site
<Soyuz> perhaps a bit of both
<Armageddon> with Altair and me helping with the technical stuff
<Typhlosion> Hmm
*Armageddon shrugs
<Armageddon> they remain as one though
<Typhlosion> Is Shiny-Ho-Oh male or female?
<Armageddon> male
<HyperMetalLugia> Nobody knows
<Typhlosion> Gay?
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<Prince-dari> And I am the font of knowledge on setting up bind. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Possibly
<Armageddon> you're not thinking of having sex with him, amirite?
*Armageddon hides

<Kosovo> o.o
<Kosovo> what
<Armageddon> apparently you need a static IP though
<Soyuz> While Armageddon is our fuck-do-everything queen
<TR_Reed> 14what?
<Soyuz> almost like two states in a nation
<Soyuz> Texas and New York
<Armageddon> lol the only rules I would enforce here
<Typhlosion> Armageddon should be my Queen-do-fuck-everything <3
<Soyuz> You enforce rules?
<Armageddon> would be "don't be an annoying retard" and "don't attack the network"
<Armageddon> haha xD
<Prince-dari> To run it, or for the redirect IP?
<Armageddon> redirect, dari
<Prince-dari> Because you can just have it redirect on an IP range.
<SilverSonic> Hyper hates me and Starlit ;_;
<Soyuz> Armageddon; for the first one I have my doubts
<Soyuz> second one, yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> I do not hate you

<drfsupercenter> 03GO PIKACHU USE A POISON MOVE
<Chimera> Honestly drf, it just gets old when you make countless amounts of jokes bashing the 5th generation just because you hate their designs to hell and back... Bot not everyone here does, so you're kind of making a joke to only make yourself laugh
<Chimera> Also WTF LOL
<Chimera> I never knew Pikachu could use Toxic
<Chimera> o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03also Chimera not everyone here likes them
<Chimera> No
<drfsupercenter> 03and others do find it funny
<drfsupercenter> 03so it gets old when you say it gets old
*drfsupercenter hidews
<Chimera> But it is still kind of old
<drfsupercenter> 03-w
<Chimera> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03so is you pointing that out
<Chimera> I don't see anyone laughing though :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah, Fearow, Haunter, Pikachu, Vileplume, Staryu, and Arcanine can all learn Toxic

<drfsupercenter> 03and I didn't trade Gengar
<Damos> 13Quick everyone turn to the Scy FI channel
<drfsupercenter> 03as Gengar is actually worse
<drfsupercenter> 03AFAIK
<Chimera> Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03as doesn't it lose its Levitate?
<Chimera> O.o
<drfsupercenter> 03Damos no u
<Chimera> It does

<Chimera> Interesting
<Damos> 13Chrono Crusade is being played
<drfsupercenter> 03I think so

<drfsupercenter> 03People just weren't HERE

<Chimera> K then drf
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<Chimera> Ascendant lol
<drfsupercenter> 03Gengar does have Levitate
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Damos> 13thanks
<Chimera> Come on not all of them suck :V
<drfsupercenter> 03I coulda sworn someone told me it's actually bad to evolve HJaunter
<drfsupercenter> 03-J
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, they all suck

<Damos> 13Chrono Crusade is being played
<Damos> 13AN ANIME ON SCIFY!
<SilverSonic> XD
<Chimera> I can name a few previous generations that have as weird designs as the new one
<SilverSonic> Oh jeez
<Chimera> To be quite honest
<Chimera> I can quote this one comic I saw that's very accurate
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said the old ones were perfect
<Chimera> "Pokémon aren't getting uglier, you're just getting older!"
<drfsupercenter> 03that's wrong
<Ascendant> no
<Chimera> No it isn't
<drfsupercenter> 03they're getting uglier AND I'm getting older
<Chimera> But
<Altair> lol
<Chimera> There are a few redundancies within gens
*Aristeo mews
<Damos> 13drf gtfo if it wasn't my birthday today
<Ascendant> Pokemon are becoming so old they're get arthritis!
*drfsupercenter hands Chimera a Garbodor
<Altair> Tbqh, after GSC the orginality started going down
<Ascendant> so they look old, nobbly and crap
<Chimera> I do acknowledge that the few that looked like evos SHOULD have been evos
<Altair> and with 5th gen, it's hit rock bottom
<Damos> 13I also have it on dvd
<drfsupercenter> 03Altair agreed, but at least most of 3rd was good
<drfsupercenter> 034th was hit or miss, most of them sucked
<Chimera> drf
<Altair> Meh, some of 3rd was good
<Altair> Yes about 4th
<Chimera> That's suppose to be litteral living trash
<Chimera> So
<Chimera> Of course it looks like trash
<drfsupercenter> 03again
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/2Qpsg.jpg
<Chimera> Because it IS trash
<Chimera> That's just a bad IDEA though
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean like making a 5th generation?
<drfsupercenter> 03that was also a bad idea
<Altair> .....
<Altair> LOL
<Chimera> Drf
<Chimera> Making anything can be a bad idea
<Chimera> But you have to realize
<Chimera> Nintendo's a company
<Chimera> So as long as adding new stuff makes a profit they'll do it :|
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03Nintendo sucks now
<Altair> in a way, i wish they would stop making new Pokemon
<Chimera> And opinions for gods sake
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid antipiracy crap
<Chimera> =/= facts
<drfsupercenter> 03they don't care about their customers anymore
<Ascendant> sucks in more than one way
<Ascendant> Chimera lol
<Ascendant> you're contradicting what you're saying
<Ascendant> yes this is opinion
<drfsupercenter> 03indeed
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said it wasn't opinion
<Ascendant> but if it's opinion then you shouldn't care
<Altair> heh, neither does sony or MS
<Chimera> :c
<drfsupercenter> 03you're just "I don't agree with you so you're forcing us to believe you" or something
<drfsupercenter> 03Altair I know
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate Sony too
<drfsupercenter> 03at least the Xbox works
<Chimera> Very well then :P
<drfsupercenter> 03unlike the PS3, that garbage absolutely does not work
<Ascendant> MS sucks
<Altair> PS3 is a joke, sorry to those who have it
<Chimera> And drf
<Ascendant> more than sonny
<Ascendant> sony
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I know MS sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03nah
<drfsupercenter> 03Sony is FAR worse
<drfsupercenter> 03at least Microsoft stands behind their products
<drfsupercenter> 03I've gotten so much free crap from Microsoft
<drfsupercenter> 03because of warranties
<Altair> heh
<drfsupercenter> 03Sony is all
<Chimera> The antipiracy is because they don't want people ripping their games and losing money
<drfsupercenter> 03"It's under warranty but we don't like you, so we make you pay"
<Altair> A friend of mine gave me a pair of Microsoft speakers
<Chimera> However yes
<Altair> made in 1998
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera
<drfsupercenter> 03how many times do we have to mention
<Chimera> There are a billion people who don't pirate
<Chimera> But
<drfsupercenter> 03that piracy does not actually cost companies money
<DarthSidious> who the fuck
<Altair> Best computer speaker set. Ever.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's been proven time and time again
<DarthSidious> is goldrun
<Chimera> Well
<Chimera> It has them make less than they could hae
<Chimera> *have
<Altair> Heh
<Chimera> :/
<Chimera> So
<Altair> Like they need all that $$$
<Ascendant> and I don't think people who pirate care.
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly.'
<Chimera> In a company's mindset
<Altair> They can go sh-
<drfsupercenter> 03most people wouldn't actually pay anyway
<Chimera> They want more
<Chimera> So
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's not that they could be making more
<Chimera> Even though jit sucks
<Chimera> *it
<drfsupercenter> 03I like how Microsoft does it
<Chimera> Hey do it so they can get more money
<drfsupercenter> 03"we don't care if you hack your Xbox, just don't try playing online with it"
<Altair> I do both
<drfsupercenter> 03Nintendo's all "If you hack we're gonna find you by invading your privacy"
<Altair> come at me MS
<Chimera> So yes Nintendo sucks but their mindset isn't abnormal
<drfsupercenter> 03If you have WiiConnect24 turned on
<Chimera> ...Today at lease >.>
<drfsupercenter> 03they can and will spy on you
<drfsupercenter> 03and can possibly start bricking homebrewed Wiis
<Chimera> Wait seriously
<junh1024-XD> there's $$ lost from lost sales due to pirazy. there's also $$ gained from sales because someone liked their pirated version so much that they bought it.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's fricking stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03HYep.
<Chimera> Wow
<drfsupercenter> 03-H
<drfsupercenter> 03do you think I just make this stuff up before going EW [whoever]?
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4yes
<drfsupercenter> 03I do my research before I hate stuff./
<Prince-dari> I buy games that I like from companies I like - I generally only pirate things I would never actually buy.
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a good reason for hating the companies I hate.
<Chimera> That's fair
<drfsupercenter> 03same here Prince-dari
<drfsupercenter> 03like I bought B/W
<HyperMetalLugia> Same DRF
*Creideiki returns
<HyperMetalLugia> WB
<drfsupercenter> 03I buy games that actually make it worth the money
<Altair> Same with Dari
<Altair> wb
<drfsupercenter> 03but paying $50 for Pokémon Battle Revolution
<Creideiki> I only pirate stuff that is way too overpriced.
<drfsupercenter> 03worse mistake of my life
<Altair> Actually, I never pirate games
<drfsupercenter> 03that thing isn't even worth 50 CENTS
<drfsupercenter> 03let alone dollars
<Prince-dari> Bethesda FTW, they release the software they use to make their games.
<Altair> well, with the exception of some Xbox games
<Ascendant> LOL Bethesda
<Chimera> PKBR is battleing only
<Ascendant> they f*cked up oblivion's engine
<drfsupercenter> 03I know, it's stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03it shoulda just been wiiware
<Ascendant> if they do that to skyrim
<Chimera> Who made that desicion?
<Prince-dari> Thanks Altair
<Creideiki> Also, I don't buy stuff where the legitimate buyer faces worse annoyances then a pirate.
<Ascendant> people are going to rage
<drfsupercenter> 03I was all OMG THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE POKÉMON XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but nope
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not
<drfsupercenter> 03at all
<drfsupercenter> 03I wasted a good $50 on that s***
<Chimera> I wish it was
<Chimera> ;.;
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah, products that don't deserve the money
<drfsupercenter> 03plus
<drfsupercenter> 03how much do you think it actually costs Nintendo to make a Wii disc
<Creideiki> However, if something I /really/ want has utter horrible DRM, I will - if I enjoy the series - buy the DRM'd version... and play the pirated version.
<drfsupercenter> 03probably about $2?
<drfsupercenter> 03but yet they charge $50
<drfsupercenter> 03NOPE.AVI
<drfsupercenter> 03EW DRM
<drfsupercenter> 03I refuse to buy stuff that has DRM
<Chimera> Btw I descovered a while ago that Nintendo cares for you so they can get money :P
<Creideiki> Becuase screw the blev DRM that breaks your PC.
<drfsupercenter> 03unless there's a way to remove that DRM
<drfsupercenter> 03like iTunes
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a decrypter
<Altair> why buy music
<Chimera> As in, they make good main-series games because good gemes sell
<drfsupercenter> 03so Apple can go kiss my shiny metal butt
<Altair> o_o
<Chimera> *games
<drfsupercenter> 03Altair did I ever say music
<Creideiki> Again, I only buy crap with DRM if I can get the non-DRM version.
<Altair> movies?
<drfsupercenter> 03stuff you can't get elsewhere
<drfsupercenter> 03mainly TV shows
<drfsupercenter> 03they have stuff like Fairly OddParents complete seasons
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Prince-dari> I wonder how long till Sony GTFO the PS3 and start on their next console.

<drfsupercenter> 03this toop
<drfsupercenter> 03-p
<Chimera> When Japan got that earthquake
<Chimera> The earth sped up for a tenth of a second
<Chimera> .-.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Altair> Oh yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03speaking of that Earthquake
<junh1024-XD> so drf got the old apple TV, which isn't nerfed liek the new wan.
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what made me laugh
<Chimera> ?
<drfsupercenter> 03Nintendo was all
<Altair> I heard something about the day being altered by 1/1000th of a second
<drfsupercenter> 03"That earthquake isn't going to affect the 3DS launch because they're all made in China"
<Chimera> That "POKÉMON EVERYWHERE?"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm all LOL MADE IN CHINA
<Altair> and my mom was like ZOMG!?!?
<Chimera> ...
<Chimera> ROFL
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03they basically came out and said that
<drfsupercenter> 03true story
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Altair> lol
<Chimera> Okay
<drfsupercenter> 03<junh1024-XD> so drf got the old apple TV, which isn't nerfed liek the new wan. <- It's nerfed in that it's made by Apple and doesn't have any real use
<drfsupercenter> 03besides renting videos
<Chimera> Nintendo is officially made by careless people
<drfsupercenter> 03that thing's been sitting collecting dust since I rented the two Pokémon films
<drfsupercenter> 03and School of Rock
<HyperMetalLugia> XD]
<HyperMetalLugia> Best use.. ever
<Altair> nintendo doesn't care, why should they?
<Chimera> They don't care if their designs get more rehashes than normal
<Altair> x-x
<drfsupercenter> 03I was considering selling it off to some n00b fanboy but I figured in case they ever release more Pokémon movies..
<Chimera> Or if they look like retards in public
*Chimera runs
<Chimera> They just want their cadh
<Chimera> Cash
<Altair> i mean, seriously
<Chimera> Since when did this happen D:
<junh1024-XD> or other exclusive issh
<Altair> they can resell something like a pro
<drfsupercenter> 03since the Wii came out
<drfsupercenter> 03more or less
<Chimera> Oh yes since Diamond
<Chimera> Yeah
<Altair> NDS - DS Lite- DSi - DSi XL
<drfsupercenter> 03Dude
<drfsupercenter> 03DSi XL is the most awesome thing ever
<drfsupercenter> 03don't be hating
<HyperMetalLugia> DSiXL is pro
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah ;(
<Chimera> The "Nintendo Revolution" was them changing their ways
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like Nintendo's version of the iPad
*drfsupercenter hides
<drfsupercenter> 03but seriously I like the DSi XL
<HyperMetalLugia> But better!?
<Altair> Heh
<HyperMetalLugia> Same, I don't need to use my glasses when playing
<Chimera> The DSi XL is for people who strain their eyes looking at the pixels
<Altair> But seriously... all they did was resize it.
*Chimera flees~
<HyperMetalLugia> And I can read fanfics ar night <3
<Chimera> Yes Altair
<HyperMetalLugia> *at
<Prince-dari> Still don't get the point of the iPad - it's like my iPod, but it doesn't fit in my pocket? DX
<Chimera> It's a DS with a bigger screen
<HyperMetalLugia> Aka: Most geeks
<Chimera> But people drool over it
<Chimera> X.x
<HyperMetalLugia> Well my DSLight was dying anyway ;(
<Altair> Same thing with the GBA line, with the SP and Micro
<HyperMetalLugia> So, why not keep my DSLight for my GBA games, my GBA-Sp for my GB/GBC games?~
<junh1024-XD> damt,
<Ascendant> SP lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Mirco was stupid
<junh1024-XD> AFX STOP CRASHING!
<Ascendant> mine is...somewhere
<Chimera> The 3DS on the other hand has the glassesless 3D with a D-pad (finally) and accellerometer
<Ascendant> anyone want it?
<Altair> I have four SPs
<Chimera> And higher pixel ratio
<Altair> 3DS seems kinda cool
<Chimera> Yeah
<Chimera> Dual camera :3
<Altair> D-pad is refreshing
<HyperMetalLugia> Somone who actually likes the 3DS
<Altair> Cameras lol
<Prince-dari> I find it annoying that you actually have to go to a demonstration to see how well the 3DS works.
<HyperMetalLugia> 3D pics and movies and AR stuff
<Chimera> I can take a picture of myself
<Chimera> IN THREEEEEEEE DEEEEEEEE
*Chimera hides
<HyperMetalLugia> Plus other fun things
<Chimera> Prince-dari: That's because the 3DS is 3D
<Prince-dari> I know.
<Chimera> Cameras can't record what the eyes can see
<Prince-dari> I'd like to see how well it works, but CBA going somewhere specifically to find out.
<Chimera> Accurately
<Chimera> I mean
<Chimera> Blah
<Prince-dari> That's not worth my time. XD
<Altair> ^
<Chimera> Fair enough :3
<Altair> I won't be getting it due to price
<Chimera> I'm getting it anyway because of the new games getting listed for it and such
*DarthSidious os chankill #True-Flame
<Altair> http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/01/nintendo_portable_comparison_01.jpg
<Altair> lol
<Prince-dari> Currently my most-hated new thing is the PS Move, don't get the point.
<Prince-dari> Everyone's already got a wii.
<HyperMetalLugia> Saame
<Chimera> That's in price range yes?
<Chimera> Lol
<SilverSonic> o_o
<HyperMetalLugia> Kinect seems decent (when I would use it for the PC)
*SilverSonic randomly Hugs NS :3
<Altair> I lol at Kinect
<Chimera> The Phat is more expensive than the Lite
<DarthSidious> I accidentally did that on #4chan once
<DarthSidious> akilled and glined everyone in the channel
<HyperMetalLugia> Win Nintendo
<DarthSidious> which was like 15
<DarthSidious> x.x
<Altair> I was wearing a black hoodie and it couldn't pick me up
<SilverSonic> o.o
*DarthSidious hugs back
<Chimera> Kinect ain't too bad
<Prince-dari> LOL
<Chimera> And LOL
<Chimera> yeah
<Chimera> Et this

<Chimera> Rofl
<HyperMetalLugia> 3 second fail
<Chimera> No
<Chimera> It doesn't
<Chimera> I'm not being racist
<Chimera> It's true
<Altair> I know
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> I know, any videos
<Altair> Not what you said, but the fact that it is
<Prince-dari> Wii seemed great when it first came out, but did anyone just stop using it after a while?
<Chimera> I think it's because their skin absorbs the IR or something
<Altair> I.
<HyperMetalLugia> Homebrew on Wii FTW
<Prince-dari> I find that I much prefer playing games with a proper controller.
<Chimera> Classic controller <3
<Prince-dari> Or on PC.
<Chimera> And GC controller <333
<HyperMetalLugia> I rarely play games now, but GC controller FTW
<Altair> I haven't used my Wii since... my house was hit by lightning and half it was burnt.
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Altair> Which has been a year ago
<Chimera> Wow
<Chimera> Okay
<Prince-dari> O_o
<Chimera> So your house gets hit
<Chimera> "Alright I'm done with the Wi
<Chimera> i"
<Chimera> Nice way to make desicions :P
<Altair> Reverse the order
*Chimera hides
<Altair> XD
<Prince-dari> Did the lightning just destroy the wii and nothing else?
<Chimera> Oh wow
<Chimera> God apparently was not pleased
<Altair> Nah, the Wii is fine
*Chimera runs
<Chimera> "No moar wii"
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Chimera> *strikes lightning*
<Altair> My only personal loss was a LAN card getting fried and my Silver version
<Altair> losses
<HyperMetalLugia> Aww ;(
<Chimera> "O_O;;;;;;;"
<Chimera> ...
<HyperMetalLugia> How did silver die?
<Chimera> Silcer
<Altair> And my savegame from Gold
<Chimera> Silver
<Chimera> Gone
<Chimera> WHAT
<Chimera> .
<Chimera> That sucks
<Chimera> ;-;
<Altair> Yes
<Altair> Well
<Altair> The fire department used a TON of water to put it out
<Chimera> Good thing HGSS came out that year
<Chimera> Oh

<Umbreon> 12the EV reducing berries
<Umbreon> 12aren't even in the game
<Chimera> Reducing?
<Umbreon> 12you know what EVs are right?
<Chimera> Why reduce EV stats? o.o
<Chimera> Yes
<Chimera> Effort values
<Umbreon> 12yes
<Chimera> Why reduce them?
<Umbreon> 12in the previous games
<Umbreon> 12there were berries out there that would remove EVs from a pokemon
<Chimera> Why would you want that...?
<Umbreon> 12incase if they were not EV trained properly or if you want to put different values in
<Chimera> Ah
<Umbreon> 12like your beginning pokemon
<Chimera> Well
<Umbreon> 12would be really hard to EV train
<Armageddon> lol
<Chimera> Now there's wings
<Umbreon> 12those don't remove EVs
<Chimera> Just use your bike
<Umbreon> 12they add them
<Chimera> And ride accross the bridge
<Chimera> Get wings
<Chimera> Add EVs
<Chimera> :>
<Umbreon> 12that's besides the point
<Umbreon> 12they shouldn't remove something like that
<Chimera> Well no harm having greater EVs for backup no?

<drfsupercenter> 03someone call Nintendo and tell them to have more fricking events near Detroit
<drfsupercenter> 03as I'd go
<Anakin> or most regulars do

<Umbreon> 12it's pretty high priced
<drfsupercenter> 03I just had to go out int he hall to throw stuff out XD
<Skylands> 10Kyu, I'm not allowed to use eBay
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03what ARE you allowed to use then
<Skylands> 10Amazon
<Skylands> 10XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I've relayed stuff for people before, I can buy it and send it to you for a price :P
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<HyperMetalLugia> Amazon ,3
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, for the price it actually costs XD
<drfsupercenter> 03plus how much I have to pay to ship
<Skylands> 10Hm
<Skylands> 10maybe
<Umbreon> 12i should of charged drf for shipping XD
<Umbreon> 12when i gave him those games
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Skylands> 10I dunno how I could receive it before my parents see
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah yeah
<Skylands> 10and go like, "WTF IS THIS"
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Skylands> 10"YOU GIVING AWAY YOUR ADDRESS TO PPL ONLINE"
<Skylands> 10:P
<Umbreon> 12what's done is done
<Umbreon> 12i have bad habits of doing dumb stuff
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolparents
<drfsupercenter> 03Skylands well
<blarget2> lol
<Umbreon> 12i had one of those pokemon thinkchip stadiums
<drfsupercenter> 03do your parents get the mail before you get home from school
<Skylands> 10Yeh
<Umbreon> 12i sold it to a friend for 4 dollars along with a couple thinkchip pokedex's and a bunch of thinkchips
<Skylands> 10I was thinking
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03that fails then
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Skylands> 10You could put it up on Amazon
<drfsupercenter> 03I could just not put my return address
<Umbreon> 12go on amazon and they are selling just the stadium alone for 90 dollars
<Skylands> 10and I could buy it from there
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not actually required
<Skylands> 10oh?
<drfsupercenter> 03to have a return address
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's generally just common courtesy
<Skylands> 10They might still question where I got it from, though
<drfsupercenter> 03but I've done it a lot
<drfsupercenter> 03just say you bought it on Amazon
<Skylands> 10and Idk how I'd pay you back x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03because like
<drfsupercenter> 03if you buy stuff on Amazon Marketplace
<drfsupercenter> 03it's gonna come from some random person
<Skylands> 10[21:05] <%drfsupercenter> just say you bought it on Amazon <- I don't have a credit card
<Skylands> 10so they might think I stole theirs or something
<drfsupercenter> 03so you would ask your parents to get it for you?
<Skylands> 10Probably
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno then
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'd be willing to relay if needed XD
<Skylands> 10I'll figure out some way to make this work
<Skylands> 10I need a legit excuse
*SheenaFox|Afk buuuuuuurps
<Skylands> 10a believable one
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03well you knwo where to find me

*Damos huggles
*SheenaFox jumps into the conversation
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah that's how I did it with Chimera
<HyperMetalLugia> 10 days until 3DS :P
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<Skylands> 10Eh
<drfsupercenter> 03I just mailed the stuff to a friend of his
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Skylands> 10My friends most likely aren't willing to do it
<SheenaFox> Huzzah!
<SheenaFox> D:
<SheenaFox> You have horrible friends
<Chimera> 04^
*Chimera runs
<Skylands> 10They can be

<Chimera> 04*:c
<Skylands> 10Another thing, whenever we buy off Amazon, my dad makes the deliver to his workplace
<Skylands> 10So if it were to show up at the house without him knowing, he'd find it suspcious
<Skylands> 10suspicious*
<Skylands> 10so Idk
<Skylands> 10Perhaps I should go find a cardboard box and give it an address

<drfsupercenter> 03Heh
<Chimera> 04that's fair
<SilverSonic|Live|KPWN> so i named it SilverSonic Super Sexy Slam XD
<Skylands> 10She always says, "You never win those things anyway"
<SilverSonic|Live|KPWN> and then my normal Saturday Show on Radio Nintendo

<NightSeas> 12Hia SilverSonic
<Chimera> 04loldrf
<Skylands> 10Mailing cash is unsafe in most conditions
<Chimera> 04my ROM is sooo slower than my actual card
<drfsupercenter> 03true, but I've done it
<Chimera> 04When trading
<Skylands> 10Using a check could work
<Chimera> 04it ends a second or two after the official copy
<Chimera> 04XD
<Skylands> 10But I don't have those yet
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Anakin> wb
<SilverSonic|Live|KPWN> wb
<drfsupercenter> 03or you could just tell your mom the truth and say one of your friends has a Pokémon card they're willing to sell and you want it
<drfsupercenter> 03or something
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> I bet they'll laugh :(
<Reed|Away> 14what's going on?
<Skylands> 10As soon as the words "online friend" comes up in what I say
<Skylands> 10Mum would rage
<HyperMetalLugia> Same x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03I know what you could do
<drfsupercenter> 03they have Krogers where you live, right?
<Skylands> 10Yeh
<HyperMetalLugia> Because 100% of all IRC is child molesters
<drfsupercenter> 03Kroger sells pre-paid Visa cards
<SheenaFox> Yup
<drfsupercenter> 03that you could just go buy using cash
<drfsupercenter> 03and pay that way
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<SheenaFox> I molest children ;D
<drfsupercenter> 03that's how I did it in high school
<Chimera> 04o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03before I got a debit card
<Chimera> 04Sheena wut
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet you're a child
<nickstr> not just Kroger but other stores too
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but some stores sell ones that don't work online
<drfsupercenter> 03like CVS and Rite-Aid have Vanilla Gift Card, taht doesn't work online
<Skylands> 10How am I supposed to buy one with my parents around? I don't drive yet
<Darklust> thanks
<drfsupercenter> 03Kroger's do

<TR_Reed> 14XD
*SheenaFox nommed
<NightSeas> 12Why not get a P.O. Box?
<Skylands> 10That requires asking my parents to drive me up there
<Umbreon> 12besides
<Skylands> 10Again, they'll question it
<Umbreon> 12i don't think she can get a PO Box without parent consent
<NightSeas> 12Oh, true
<NightSeas> 12Na, parent consent is only for people that are 15

<drfsupercenter> 03I could
<drfsupercenter> 03but what if your parents don't let you get it
<Skylands> 10They should
<Skylands> 10as long as it's not overly expensive
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03well I can buy the one on ebay and put it on there when I get it
<Skylands> 10They got ticked when I bought a Salamence plsuh for almost $50
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd have to convert my account to an Amazon seller's account :/
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe DRF can really become a supercenter ;P
<Skylands> 10That works
<Skylands> 10Btw, how much are you selling it for?
<drfsupercenter> 03whatever the price is that I pay for it o.o
*Skylands hopes cheap
<Skylands> 10I need to start saving

<drfsupercenter> 03-C
<Skylands> 10Don't charge me for shipping

<Quilava> well all right then
<Griggs> absolutely nothing
<RedJolteon> HML, I'll probably finish it in, like, never.
<Quilava> okay then, good to know
<Griggs> the only reason there's a side is to protect the inside
<HyperMetalLugia> (That was fixed due to loose screws and the frame when the side was off)
<RedJolteon> It's a side project.
<HyperMetalLugia> Aw ;3
<HyperMetalLugia> Waiting for the water to heat lol
<RedJolteon> XP
*HyperMetalLugia lololols all over RJ X3

<Neon> Hm. The reason I chose Black is because the legendary seems so much cooler, to be honest. xD I didn't know much about the differences between them.
<SilverSonic> !say hi
<Stormy> People are preferring White because it has the White Forest where you can catch Pokemon from previous generations
<RedDragonX> what's pokemon
<Stormy> Black just has a city where you can battle people
<Neon> I think it's a kind of soup.
<SilverSonic> I forgot how to speak through someone
<SilverSonic> XD
<Neon> Yeah, I really don't care much about that. I mean, I'll just get 1-4th gen Pokemon from trades.

<RedDragonX> gonna be nothing but pokemon for the next six months
<Stormy> Nah, everyone will have finished the game by then
<Chimera> Lolz
<Stormy> And probably both since it has both solid and liquid
<Neon> Not to mention the replay value of Pokemon is extremely high.
<Neon> Yeah, I say both.

*Umbreon mods drf to like apple
<Stormy> I tried playing Blue
<Stormy> I didn't care for it
<Neon> The last I played all the way through was Emerald. Stormy, did you play the first gen when they came out?
<RedDragonX> Only version I played was Red
<Stormy> Probably because I played the remake first
<RedDragonX> my sister used Blue
<Stormy> No, I didn't
<Neon> :O
<Stormy> I wasn't allowed to play the games because they were too violent
<Neon> That's why. It's difficult to go backward if you started. LOL
<RedDragonX> LOL
<junh1024-XD> so Ascendant
<junh1024-XD> i herd you wanted me to autosuiciding.
<Neon> Turning off battle animations would remove the "violence", right?
<Stormy> I got banned from watching the show around the time second generation came out
<Stormy> Probably not
<RedDragonX> you got banned from doing A LOT of things until you went to college
<RedDragonX> last I rememberd
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai Junh ;3

<RedDragonX> I don't remember
<Neon> Cyborgs are evil.
<RedDragonX> i think they said "damn" in one episode
<RedDragonX> and my mom banned in
<Stormy> XD
<RedDragonX> "it"
<Stormy> Sounds like something my parents would do
<Stormy> They banned me from things because villains said "I will kill you"
<Stormy> and because characters said "stupid"

<SilverSonic> WOO
<Angel_Espeon> 13That song LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13I usually hate that kind of music, but daaaamn that song's catchy
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<Espeon> 06o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03it's kinda stupid because all the radio edits leave the f-words in
<drfsupercenter> 03since they can't understand British accents x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually properly edited this
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol wut, how is a British accent hard to understand?
<drfsupercenter> 03because this is America
<drfsupercenter> 03don't look at me
<Espeon> 06I never understood that either, unless it's really really stereotypicall thick and all :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 13 minutes
<Espeon> 06But then again, all accents can be hard to understand if one goes to extremes
<Espeon> 06:3
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03this accent isn't too bad
<drfsupercenter> 03but then again
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm used to British accents since I've heard them a lot
<SilverSonic> Hi Peer
<drfsupercenter> 03first time I talked to Articuno on the phone I was like WHAT DID YOU SAY?
<Chimera> XD
<Chimera> Some accents are easy to understand
<Chimera> Thick accents make me want to hurt myself x.x
<Espeon> 06I love accents personally :3
<drfsupercenter> 03why, since it makes the world more confusing?
<SilverSonic> my 1st ex had a slight southern accent xD
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Chimera> Drf
<drfsupercenter> 03just curious, how old are you SilverSonic

<Chimera> I have some of those I think
<junh1024-XD> Chimera I listened to you plasma mp3.
<junh1024-XD> a
<drfsupercenter> 03that's not even an old game
<Chimera> Didn't D/P have then?
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<Chimera> Kewl
<junh1024-XD> couple of things,
<drfsupercenter> 03most games do
<Chimera> Hm?
<junh1024-XD> Volume is too loud. Not enough panning (stereo separation), and please use AAC, not MP3.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah even the new DSi enhanced games have the GBA holders
<drfsupercenter> 03mp3 ftw
<Chimera> ...
<Chimera> The format is MP3 because it's a mixdown of the MIDI file
<Chimera> Which I'm importing into a game :|
<junh1024-XD> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03there's nothing wrong with mp3, really
<Chimera> The purpose of the export is just so people can hear it :P
<drfsupercenter> 03as long as it's not like 128kbps LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03192 or higher is good

<drfsupercenter> 03Why are all these songs lacking ID3v2 tags >_>
<junh1024-XD> it really depends.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Chimera> Oh nvm
<Chimera> Anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03o/` maneater, make you work hard o/`
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why I like this song but I do
<HyperMetalLugia> ;3
<drfsupercenter> 03especially when sped up by 4%
<junh1024-XD> so in which case, my feedback is irrelevent, ae?
<Chimera> Volume is suppose to be loud junh1024-XD
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> I don't like the quality of web radios using AAC+
<drfsupercenter> 03it makes everything more energetic XD
<Chimera> Yes
<Chimera> It kinda is xP
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03if you make the volume too loud, it sounds overdriven./
<drfsupercenter> 03which is n00b.
<Chimera> Lolz
<drfsupercenter> 03no I'm serious
<drfsupercenter> 03*serious
<Chimera> It's the default volume
<drfsupercenter> 03it was one of the biggest problems when editing multitrack OGGs
<Chimera> .-.
<drfsupercenter> 03was making them not overdriven
<drfsupercenter> 03I had to lower the volume a LOT
<junh1024-XD> ctr|LIVE{RN}, sure, because theyy use like, 64kps HEAAC, i'm sayin 128kps LCAAC may be fine, in general.
<Chimera> Drf
<peer> trollface.jpg
<Chimera> My vs RSE trainer was louder than that
<nickstr> quite true, some 128k mp3 files can sound decent or even good
<Chimera> And you can barely hear it on a DS
<nickstr> it depends on the codec
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not just about "loud"
<junh1024-XD> encoder AND content.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's all relative volume
<nickstr> yes
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> And the DS sound quality isn't that high
<junh1024-XD> like, speech vs. percussive music.
<Chimera> K
<drfsupercenter> 03I encode speech stuff at 128kbps
<nickstr> in the case of music not compressed to heck
<Chimera> ctrl
<drfsupercenter> 03all the Mojo In The Morning Phone Scams discs
<Chimera> You're right
<nickstr> in terms of dynamic range
<Chimera> It's very bad actually
<Chimera> Some high notes crackle if too high
<Chimera> Yet they're perfectly fine in FL Studio
<Chimera> -.-
<drfsupercenter> 03what's the point of FL Studio?
<drfsupercenter> 03isn't it just like Audacity
<drfsupercenter> 03but not
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> Song fadeouts sounds bad on DS too
<Chimera> What I exported might not even sound like that
<Chimera> Um
<Chimera> Drf
<Chimera> It's more professional
<Chimera> TRUST me
<drfsupercenter> 03professional is just a term
<Chimera> And it supports dls I think
<lightumbreon> heya
<Chimera> Plus
<lightumbreon> *heya GL
<drfsupercenter> 03as soon as someone says they're a professional, if they use a Mac, nope, they aren't professional. at all.
<Chimera> The way it exports .midi files is the required format for importing
<NightSeas> 12Hello lightumbreon :3
<drfsupercenter> 03as TRUE professionals use their own operating systems LOL
<Chimera> Or esle the tempo screws up
<Chimera> Bad
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03still
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't buy "This software is better because pros use it"
<drfsupercenter> 03that isn't a valid argument to me
<Chimera> Lolz
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm serious
<Chimera> Because pro stuff can be done with it
<Chimera> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03it's why I don't use Adobe Premiere
<drfsupercenter> 03that program is a complete utter piece of garbage
<Chimera> Premier annoys me
<nickstr> all that matters to me is the quality of the end product
<nickstr> I don't care how you end up with it
<drfsupercenter> 03Corel VideoStudio is the most "pro" thing I've seen
<Chimera> After Effects is soooo much better
<drfsupercenter> 03EW ADOBE
<drfsupercenter> 03Adobe products are BAD
<drfsupercenter> 03save for maybe Photoshop
<Chimera> After Effects isn't that bad actually
<nickstr> just hideously overpriced
<NightSeas> 12lol, drf
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's just because everybody and their brother uses it
<Chimera> Photoshop is pretty cool
<NightSeas> 12I don't know what I'd do without Ai and Adobe PS
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> You can say the same with SAM Broadcaster vs. Winamp + plugins
<nickstr> correct
<Chimera> Illustrator helps me
<Chimera> A lot
<Chimera> :E
<nickstr> I use Winamp plus the Stereo Tool plugin for AM and FM micropower broadcasting
<NightSeas> 12It really helps me
<Chimera> :3
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm sure there are other programs that do the same thing
<drfsupercenter> 03they just aren't popular
<drfsupercenter> 03but see, I tend to dislike popular products because most of the time they suck
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> I use SAM Broadcaster to broadcast my RN show
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<nickstr> and the sound quality coming out of the processor sounds quite a bit like $10,000 to $15,000 digital processors
<drfsupercenter> 03we've already proven that like 90% of humanity is stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03so if most people use something
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> And it caused me a delay!
<drfsupercenter> 03it's probably stuipd
<drfsupercenter> 03it just goes along with it
<HyperMetalLugia> Lols
<drfsupercenter> 03well, there are exceptions.
<drfsupercenter> 03like Windows, yeah everyone uses that because it's actually good LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay <3
<nickstr> digital processors will always have a delay
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<nickstr> of a second or two
<drfsupercenter> 03I need to go shower
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai
<drfsupercenter> 03why, so you can blip out realtime swearing?

<drfsupercenter> 03it tends to be considered "socially acceptable" in a lot of areas, but around here it's still considered swearing

<Espeon> 06swearing for the sake of swearing is stupid, the rest is something people will forever disagree on
<Espeon> 06whee
<SilverSonic> i agree with Espy
<SilverSonic> xD
<Chimera> Lol Esp
<Chimera> :3
<NightSeas> 12I don’t usually mind when other people around me IRL swear a bit, however

<ctr|LIVE{RN}> The censored money XD
<nickstr> Stereo Tool on FM I have had good luck with plus the fact that it is able to do scrolling dynamic RDS shocked some people when I mentioned it
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> Silver and I, we are streaming web radio... that's different from FM radio
<nickstr> it is
<nickstr> you require an internet connection of high bandwidth
<nickstr> but at the same time no transmitters
<nickstr> the processing requirements if any is done are different
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> Nah, it only requires 150 kbit/s upload or something like that
<nickstr> are you using any sort of audio processing?
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> Streaming MP3 is what I do
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> I'm not hosting the servewr
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> I'm just "sourcing" the server, which is in a dataserver in USA
<NightSeas> 12Is the new mini moding rule in the site rules now?
<nickstr> I guess something like Shoutcast or Icecast
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> Icecast is what RN uses
<nickstr> thats a common one
<nickstr> both Shoutcast and Icecast are
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> you can listen at http://radio.mode7radio.com:8000/Chan1-MP3.m3u
<nickstr> let me try something
*nickstr np: Rei Kondoh - Kamiki Village Having Passed Two Crises (Radio Nintendo! (mode7 Channel 1)) [00:00m/128kbps/44kHz]
<nickstr> there
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> Yesh.
<nickstr> its a case of older technology meets new
<peer> trollface.jpg
<nickstr> the stream works with Winamp so you are on AM right now!
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> wow
<nickstr> when I said I had my own AM and FM transmitters I was not kidding
<blarget2> peer are you resetting peer connections?
<blarget2> OH I GET IT
<peer> oh god haha
<blarget2> lmao
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> cool
<blarget2> icwutudidthar
<peer> okay so it was happening here
<SilverSonic> trollface.jpg <-- why do you keep saying this peer?
<peer> trollface.jpg
<SilverSonic> Amazing nickstr
<nickstr> they are legal low power license free transmitters
<nickstr> under Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulations
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> How large is the broadcasting area?
<nickstr> both the AM and FM transmitters are stereo
<nickstr> for AM it can be up to a few miles legally
<nickstr> FM up to about 400 feet
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> cool
<nickstr> AM has a power limit but not a range limit
<nickstr> FM has a range limit
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> ahh
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<nickstr> the AM transmitter sounds fantastic too
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> I'm sure the AM transmitter sounds like the 'ZRN
<nickstr> more like a few Japanese stations
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> But ZRN was mono
<nickstr> the AM side runs a system developed by Motorola
<nickstr> C-QUAM AM stereo
<ctr|LIVE{RN}> ooh
<nickstr> with a good stereo receiver you can't really tell the difference between this and FM

<Umbreon> 12lol
*Skylands rarely watches DN
<Umbreon> 12i hate DN
<Umbreon> 12it's too dark
<Umbreon> 12even for me
<NightSeas> 12Is DN a Anime?
<Umbreon> 12yes
<Angel_Espeon> 13O lol, I have like 6 episodes left of that anime to watch
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just got so bored of it :|
<Angel_Espeon> 13I know what happens anyway so~
<Skylands> 10Bree, what about Bleach?
<Umbreon> 12the anime was nice
<NightSeas> 12I love dark anime
<Umbreon> 12until L died
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Umbreon> 12then it got boring
<Umbreon> 12bleach
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also Wolf's Rain, another anime I stopped watching a few years ago even though I only have like 5 eps to go
<Umbreon> 12is something you put in your washer
<Umbreon> 12not something you watch
<Umbreon> 12D:
<NightSeas> 12Wolf's Rain is <3
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Umbreon> 12i have the dvd box set of wolf's rain
<Umbreon> 12and cowboy bebo
<Umbreon> 12p
<Skylands> 10Ginga Densetsu Weed > Wolf's Rain
<Angel_Espeon> 13Whenever I hear someone talking about Bleach, I always say it belongs in the toilet
<Angel_Espeon> 13because it's true :B
<NightSeas> 12I love re-watching Wolf's rain
<Skylands> 10make that Ginga Nagareboshi Gin and Ginga Densetsu Weed (sequel of GNG)
<Espeon> 06A friend of mine has been watching Bleach for ages, from what I gathered it's the "good old" "Fight someone who is the most powerful person in the world, promise. Oh I lied, go kill his boss"
<Espeon> 06And filler
<Espeon> 06:3
<Umbreon> 12i wish Case Closed still played on adult swim
<NightSeas> 12I've seen all 30 episodes too many times
<Umbreon> 12the anime is still strong in japan
<Umbreon> 12there is over 600 episode
<Umbreon> 12episodes
<Skylands> 10Cased Closed made a good manga
<NightSeas> 12Another anime I’ve been watching a lot is Dragon Drive
<Umbreon> 12lol
*Angel_Espeon hasn't watched an anime in ages
<Umbreon> 12wolf's rain is good
<Umbreon> 12but the only problem is that half the time i have no idea what the heck is going on
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have a list of like 25+ anime titles that I told myself to watch one day
<Angel_Espeon> 13:|
<Umbreon> 12a lot of things are unexplained
<NightSeas> 12The ending of wolf's rain is very sad though
<Angel_Espeon> 13Kiba was awesome until that Cheza girl came along
<Angel_Espeon> 13then it was aaaall about her
<Umbreon> 12the ending of wolf's rain has got to be the most confusing ending i ever saw
<Angel_Espeon> 13IMO xD
<Umbreon> 12everyone died then somehow came back to life
<NightSeas> 12The world was restarted
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13That reminds me of Higurashi
<NightSeas> 12I think
<Umbreon> 12that's what it would appear
<Angel_Espeon> 13except in season 2 it's all explained to you and it all makes sense
<Umbreon> 12but why did it restart?
<NightSeas> 12Had somthing to do with the luner flowers
<NightSeas> 12And the moon
<Umbreon> 12exactly
<Umbreon> 12it's kind of open ended
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Pokemon question:
<Skylands> 10The ending is left intentionally ambiguous
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Can rustling patches occur in wild double-battle areas?
<Skylands> 10Yes
<Shadow_Lugia> 6'kay.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6You'd get rare pokemon? Ovo
<Skylands> 10Yep
<Umbreon> 12a lot of problems anime have
<Umbreon> 12is they try to follow the manga
<Angel_Espeon> 13Manga > Anime
<Skylands> 10I remember watching an interview where the creators stated that a great deal of Wolf's Rain is left open for interpretation
<Angel_Espeon> 13in most cases
<Umbreon> 12but eventually they move much faster than the manga and eventually catch upto it
<Umbreon> 12then they have to make stuff up
<Angel_Espeon> 13I hate when they do that
<Angel_Espeon> 13then they rush the ending :|
<Angel_Espeon> 13e.g. Soul Eater
<Umbreon> 12inuyasha was one of the few that said "we caught up, we're done"
<Angel_Espeon> 13loved the anime, but the ending was such a fail
<NightSeas> 12I've never seen the ending of Soul Eater
<Umbreon> 12then later they made inuyasha the final episodes
<Skylands> 10[17:14] <Angel_Espeon> e.g. Soul Eater <- Agreed
*Umbreon makes Skylands watch Ranma 1/2
<Skylands> 10Ranma is so long
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Skylands> 10161 episodes
<Umbreon> 12161 episodes is nothing compared to some
<Skylands> 10It has OVAs too
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03Pokémon has well over like 700 episodes now
<drfsupercenter> 03I don;'t even pay attention to them
<Skylands> 10Exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03but with BW well underway...
<drfsupercenter> 03I know season 1 had 83 episodes, or at least according to the home video releases
<ctr> The best pokemon episode is the one that caused seizures
<Skylands> 10I prefer to stay away from animes with over 100 episodes
<drfsupercenter> 03when aired on TV it was more like 70 something
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually really do like that episode too ctr
<drfsupercenter> 03but not because of the seizure thing
<drfsupercenter> 03just because going inside a computer = WIN
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the Tron of Pokémon :D
<Umbreon> 12lol
<ctr> It's PULSEMAN!
*Umbreon pushes Skylands into the pond of drowned cookies
<ctr> In fact, Pikachu is actually based of Pulseman, and that episode also borrows from that game
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Amazon
<Umbreon> 12?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm buying both Pokémon Advancded box sets from AMazon.ca
<drfsupercenter> 03because they've been OOP for a while
<drfsupercenter> 03but for some reason the Canadian store has it
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it goes "Availablity: Usually ships in 5-7 weeks"
<ctr> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but yet two days after I order it, I get an email saying it's shipped
<drfsupercenter> 03so yay just magically coming up with one?
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually already got both, but the first boxset was all scratched up x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm exchanging it for another
<drfsupercenter> 03which just shipped today
*Skylands just realized April Fool's is coming up
<drfsupercenter> 03I wonder what kind of pranks the university will do this year
<Umbreon> 12Mr. T pities the foo
<Skylands> 10Remember last year?
<drfsupercenter> 03last year they put "I'm lost" on all the bus LCD's
<Skylands> 10Aurora set a bunch of people's forum avatars ask Magikarp
<drfsupercenter> 03and some of the other ones had "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US"
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Skylands> 10as*
<Skylands> 10I wish I had the power to do that
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Skylands> 10I'd change everyone's avatars to N or something
<Shadow_Lugia> 6XD
<NightSeas> 12XDXD
<drfsupercenter> 03Change them all to Cofagrius

<Skylands> 10o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03Nintendo, I am disappoint
<Quack> Fighting pwns ice
<SilverSonic> o_O
<Quack> ?
<drfsupercenter> 03even with the 3DS, the screens are only 240 pixels?
<SilverSonic> that was mega delayed
<Quack> Huh?
<drfsupercenter> 03MY F***ING CELLPHONE HAS A BIGGER RESOLUTION THAN THAT
<Quack> Lolz
<SilverSonic> !shipping
<Skylands> 4 SilverSonic is paired with auscompgeek
<SilverSonic> o-o
<drfsupercenter> 03my roommate and I were talking about DS systems earlier
<Quack> I dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03how much the resolution sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought the 3DS was like 480p
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's not, at all
<Umbreon> 12!shipping
<Skylands> 4 Umbreon is paired with Luna
<Quack> ;-;
<drfsupercenter> 03Wikipedia says both screens are 240
<drfsupercenter> 03top screen is wider
<Quack> Wait
<drfsupercenter> 03though I don't quite get
<Quack> That makes
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Quack> No sense
<drfsupercenter> 03how the top one can be 800x240
<Quack> .-.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not that wide o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's 16:9 it should be like 400 something
<drfsupercenter> 03also fail
<drfsupercenter> 03the 3DS battery says it'll only last 3-5 hours
<drfsupercenter> 03and since those estimates are never accurate
<Quack> ...
<drfsupercenter> 03prolly more like 1-2
<drfsupercenter> 03lame much?
<Quack> Kinda
<Umbreon> 12yes
<drfsupercenter> 03Heck, it says the DS Lite battery lasts 5-8 hours on the brightest
<drfsupercenter> 03mine lasts like 2
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03and I don't have it on the brightes
<drfsupercenter> 03t
<NightSeas> 12<%drfsupercenter> even with the 3DS, the screens are only 240 pixels? <-- The 3DS has 800×240 pixels
<Quack> Um
<Umbreon> 12i'm sure that all depends on what you do with the 3DS
<ctr> Drf, the screen is 3D enabled
<Quack> Mine is good
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas, I'm talking about height.
<drfsupercenter> 03240 pixels.
<ctr> So each other line go to each other eye
<NightSeas> 12oh
<Quack> Oh eww
<drfsupercenter> 03also WHY THE F*** ARE THE CAMERAS STILL 640x480
<drfsupercenter> 03that's so 1995
<Quack> THEY ARE?!
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep.
<Quack> What x_x
<Quack> Nintendo wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03again, Nintendo I am disappoint
<drfsupercenter> 03http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS#3DS_vs_DS_series
<Skylands> 10thunder and lightining
<Quack> SEGA should make hardware again
<Skylands> 10lightning*
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<ctr> !ew nintendo
<drfsupercenter> 15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW NINTENDO
<Quack> That's when they shined
<Quack> Screw the competition
<drfsupercenter> 03at least thank god
<drfsupercenter> 03the 3DS has analog volume
<Quack> A SEGA Dreamcast 2
<drfsupercenter> 03I fricking hate the digital volume ont eh DSi
<drfsupercenter> 03it's either too loud or too quiet
<ctr> That's a good feature
<drfsupercenter> 03which really pisses me off
<Quack> Would pwn the Wii any day
<drfsupercenter> 03digital volume absolutely fails
<Quack> Also yay
<Quack> Analog volume
<drfsupercenter> 03the 3DS went back to the slider system the DS/DS Lite have
<ctr> But at least the 3DS got 8 times the internal storage compared to the Wii
<Quack> That's a plus that SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE ALREADY
<ctr> And 16 times compared to Dsi
<drfsupercenter> 03but what good is that internal storage if nothing uses it
<Quack> Wait
<Quack> It did?!
<Quack> That's fail
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Quack> For the Wii
<drfsupercenter> 03I had heard a rumor
<ctr> 2GB internal + 2GB sd card
<ctr> on the 3DS
<Quack> -.-
<drfsupercenter> 03that Nintendo was going to allow you to use your 3DS like a flash cart
<drfsupercenter> 03and store games on it
<drfsupercenter> 03that you own on cartridges
<Quack> Orly
<ctr> Expect huge ass download titles
<drfsupercenter> 03and then no longer need the cartridge
<ctr> I guess
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm guessing that's just an urban legend
<drfsupercenter> 03though you know what made me rofl
<drfsupercenter> 03I was looking at a flash card site yesterday
<drfsupercenter> 03the are already 3DS flash cards
<Quack> That...
<drfsupercenter> 03BEFORE THE THING EVEN COMES OUT
<Quack> Would be c-
<Quack> ROFL
<Quack> well
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it's out in Japan
<drfsupercenter> 03but STILL
<Quack> It's out in other places al-
<Quack> Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03There are already several 3DS flash cards
<drfsupercenter> 03though
<Quack> I need one
<drfsupercenter> 03they're probably still DS-mode only
<ctr> The Japanese 3DS have been hacked to run DS flash carts
<Quack> ;-;
*Quack runs
<drfsupercenter> 03Quack
<drfsupercenter> 03go get a CycloDSi
<Quack> Butbut
<drfsupercenter> 03no I'm not giving you one
<Quack> It won't work
<ctr> Those 3DS flash cards are just normal DS cards, but hacked to run on the 3DS
<Quack> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I thought
<ctr> Can't run 3DS roms
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the CycloDSi can run DSi roms :P
<Quack> But
<drfsupercenter> 03why won't it work?
<drfsupercenter> 03they'll update it
<Quack> I lack a DSi?
<ctr> I guess a HBC/CFW is the real way to go for 3DS hacking
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<Quack> Um
<Quack> Oh
<Quack> OH
<drfsupercenter> 03you're missing the point
<drfsupercenter> 03it uses DSi features
<Quack> Well
<drfsupercenter> 03like the camera
<drfsupercenter> 03WHICH THE 3DS HAS
<Quack> Um
<Quack> There might be new hardware protection that can block the CycloDSi
<drfsupercenter> 03doubt it
<drfsupercenter> 03it shows up as My Healthy Cooking Coach
<ctr> Nintendo uses software protection for DS games
<Quack> Lolz
<drfsupercenter> 03so unless Nintendo is going to block that "game" too
<drfsupercenter> 03no I'm serious
<ctr> Having a whitelist of allowed games
<drfsupercenter> 03in fact, Chimera
<drfsupercenter> 03I might do my video review of the card today
<drfsupercenter> 03:>
<Quack> :3
<Chimera> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Chimera, you are a 4Cherrim.
<Chimera> ;-;
<Chimera> DUN EAT MEH
<ctr> So if a flashcards disguieses as a legal title, it's impossilbe for Nintendo to block it. Disregard the spelling.
<Chimera> I TASTE BAD
<Chimera> ROTTEN CHERRIES ;~
<Chimera> ;
<junh1024-XD> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> junh1024-XD, you are a 13Mawile.
<junh1024-XD> once in a Mawile...
<drfsupercenter> 03<ctr> So if a flashcards disguieses as a legal title, it's impossilbe for Nintendo to block it. Disregard the spelling. <- that's exactly my point
<drfsupercenter> 03all of them do that now
<Chimera> Kewl
<drfsupercenter> 03the AceKard and Supercard show up as Alex Rider Stormbreaker
<drfsupercenter> 03the DSTWO shows up as Fish Tycoon
<drfsupercenter> 03and the CycloDSi shows up as My Healthy Cooking Coach
<ctr> indeed.
<junh1024-XD> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03or some MechAssault game if you tell it to not run in DSi-enhanced mode
<ctr> Nintendo would have to implement a checksum whitelist.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03they DID, not sure how
<drfsupercenter> 03as with the DSi's 1.4.1 update, it broke all my flash cards
<drfsupercenter> 03but of course they all had updates
<drfsupercenter> 03AceKard used to be Danny Phantom
<drfsupercenter> 03that no longer worked
<drfsupercenter> 03Supercard used to be Star Wars Lethal Alliance
<drfsupercenter> 03both became Alex Rider Stormbreaker after the update, which made them work again.
<drfsupercenter> 03the CycloDSi wasn't affected as that thing's brand new anyway LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<ctr> Nintendo did make a last minute hardware fix to cyclodsi on EU/US 3DS's according to some rumors
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03well we'll have to see
<drfsupercenter> 03but see, even if they did, the CycloDSi comes with a firmware updater dongle
<drfsupercenter> 03that plugs into USB
<drfsupercenter> 03so all they'd have to do is just make a new firmware that gets around the block
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<ctr> Personally i think the way to go is a Custom FirmWare or Homebrew Channel on the 3DS.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what the Supercard did, and I'm sure they'll do it again
<drfsupercenter> 03same here
<drfsupercenter> 03but there also should have been a homebrew channel on the DSi
<HyperMetalLugia> .c.
<HyperMetalLugia> !shipping
<HyperMetalLugia> ddddd
<HyperMetalLugia> fffff
<drfsupercenter> 03the problem is, nobody has figured out how to run unsigned code on it.
<ctr> Progress have been made though.
<Chimera> Hm
<drfsupercenter> 03so the best they can do is copy the boot sector of retail DS games that are on the whitelist, and then stick their own code in them
<Chimera> Homebrew channel for 3DS...
<ctr> Using the DSiware game Sudoku, which Nintendo pulled out of the shop within 24 hours
<Chimera> That'd actually be pretty awesome.
<drfsupercenter> 03the only reason the CycloDSi exists is because there's a save exploit for MHCC which is DSi enhanced
<SilverSonic> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what? What about Sudoku
<Chimera> You guys know how much the Wii can be hacked with the Homebrew channel, righr?
<Chimera> *right
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Chimera> Also drf fun fact
<drfsupercenter> 03but see
<drfsupercenter> 03people still don't know the Wii's master code either
<Chimera> The reason the Dreamcast could have so many pirated games
<drfsupercenter> 03they just find ways around it XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03Dreamcast used CD-Rs
<drfsupercenter> 03with no copy protection
<Chimera> Is because the protection was GD-Rs
<drfsupercenter> 03so you can just burn them
<Chimera> Gigadisks
<junh1024-XD> soumm,
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<ctr> But not many games used the 1,2 GBs
<Chimera> People couldn't dump them immediately
<drfsupercenter> 03the Dreamcast used standard CDs.
<Chimera> Then people dumped them xD
<Skylands> 10!lag
<Chimera> Nope
<Sky|afk> 4 Espeon is paired with Sky|afk
<Sky|afk> 4 SilverSonic is paired with Umbreon
<Sky|afk> 4 HyperMetalLugia is paired with Aristeo
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<Chimera> It used GD-Rs
<Skylands> 10!lag
<Altair> [Skylands] Lag with flame.ho-ohrealm.net is 0.093secs
<drfsupercenter> 03You can just burn standard CDs
<drfsupercenter> 03which work perfectly fine
<drfsupercenter> 03in the Dreamcast
<Chimera> It can read CD-Rs though LOL
<junh1024-XD> mb people can make a Wii master code liek they did with HDCP ?
<Chimera> no see
<Chimera> Commercial games use GD-R
<drfsupercenter> 03junh1024-XD you don't make master codes LOL
<SilverSonic> !lag
<Skylands> 10:<
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Chimera> The Dreamcast can read them
<SilverSonic> :(
<SilverSonic> !lag
<Chimera> However
<Altair> [SilverSonic] Lag with flame.ho-ohrealm.net is 0.156secs
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't think anyone's figured out the Wii master code
<SilverSonic> X3
<NightSeas> 12!Shipping
<ctr> The Wii HBC depends on save game exploits.
<drfsupercenter> 03all the Homebrew Channel exploits are just ways people found to avoid needing it
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Chimera> The Dreamcast can also read CD-Rs
<Chimera> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well there was also Bannerbomb and I have no fricking idea how that works
<SilverSonic> neither of us have much lag
<ctr> 3DS games is like the N64, some save to internal, some save to the cartridge
<Chimera> Igglyboo made it I think
<HyperMetalLugia> It worked pretty well
<Chimera> Wait
<Chimera> What?
<drfsupercenter> 03same with the DSi
<Chimera> Now there's internal saving?
<Chimera> :|
<Skylands> 10Stupid storm
<NightSeas> 12Is !shipping off?
<drfsupercenter> 03why do you care?>
<junh1024-XD> !boating
<NightSeas> 12:<
<Chimera> If Pokémon ever does that I'll be pissed
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Chimera> That's why
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Chimera> :U
<drfsupercenter> 03I meant about the script
<drfsupercenter> 03also
<Chimera> Oh
<drfsupercenter> 03that's similar to how the ESR hack works for the PS2
<Skylands> 4 NightSeas is paired with Quanyails
<Skylands> 4 NightSeas is paired with Espeon
<Chimera> Still
<SilverSonic> o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03since the PS2 can read DVD-Rs
<Chimera> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Chimera, you are a 2Chandelure.
<NightSeas> 12lol
<drfsupercenter> 03but only if they're videos
<Chimera> YES
*Chimera haunts people
<drfsupercenter> 03so it patches the game ISO to make it look like a video
<NightSeas> 12Never mind
<drfsupercenter> 03and then forces the PS2 to boot as a game XD
*Chimera burns DRF's soul
<drfsupercenter> 03that way the PS2 can read it without needing a modchip
*Chimera flies away
<drfsupercenter> 03it's pretty nice
<ctr> should test it
<ctr> on my V7 PS2
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway ctr, what is that about Sudoku?
<drfsupercenter> 03someone hacked it?
<ctr> Yes
<drfsupercenter> 03and the thing is, in order to run ESR, you have to have a hacked memory card
<drfsupercenter> 03which requires a modded system in order to make
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's kinda a catch 22
<drfsupercenter> 03my roommate has a Swap Magic so I just used that to make mine.
<drfsupercenter> 03what'd they do with the Sudoku thing?
<Sky|afk> 4 Espeon is paired with Aristeo
<Sky|afk> 4 SilverSonic is paired with EpicStatsGuy
<Sky|afk> 4 HyperMetalLugia is paired with Amatsumagatsuchi
<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<Nightshadow|VNC> Skylands, you are a 10Skorupi.
<Skylands> 10Eh
<ctr> They injected an exploit to the game's file
<Chimera> Brb
<ctr> Nintendo pulled it off the store within 24 hours of the exploit
<SilverSonic> Sky, is everything ok there, youre connection looks like its flipping out there or something
<drfsupercenter> 03what'd the hack let them do?
<ctr> Run homebrew.
<Chimera> 04well
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03so there's no longer a Sudoku in the DSi store?
<Chimera> 04apparently it was something that allowed the system to be hacked
<NightSeas> 12Bye for now, every one!
<drfsupercenter> 03or did they just replace it with another one
<ctr> nope
<Chimera> 04cya
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03weird
<Chimera> 04well
<Chimera> 04is there any way for the Exploit to be done anymore? ;.;
<Umbreon> 12hi
<drfsupercenter> 03prolly not
<drfsupercenter> 03short of what the CycloDSi did
<Chimera> 04:/
<drfsupercenter> 03which is using a retail game
<drfsupercenter> 03rather than a downloaded one
<ctr> http://hackmii.com/2011/01/sudokuhax-release
<drfsupercenter> 03well

<Chimera> 04If anyone dumped the Sudoku exploit
<drfsupercenter> 03it MAY be

<Chimera> 04Awesome

<drfsupercenter> 03sure why not
<drfsupercenter> 03that's how normal DS flash cards work
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03DSi ones, rather
<drfsupercenter> 03like the AceKard 2i
<drfsupercenter> 03they just take the bootsector of the real game and mod the rest
<ctr> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03hm yep, just searched the DSi store for Sudoku and only other stuff showed up
<drfsupercenter> 03Brain Age Express: Sudoku etrc

<jasperdett|laptop> hi
<ctr> It took a little before that game got "hacked" because of that
<ctr> Hardware anti piracy :P
<drfsupercenter> 03EW ANTIPIRACY
<Aristeo> :3
<drfsupercenter> 03DS games cannot be played with 3D visuals on the 3DS. The games are displayed in a scaled and stretched fashion due to the differences between the DS's top screen and the 3DS's top screen unless the user holds down the Start and Select buttons upon launch of the DS software. <- EW STRETCHING VIDEOS
<ctr> Don't worry, it's bilinear scaling
<ctr> Not like when playing GB/GBC games on the GBA with stretching o
<ctr> *on
<drfsupercenter> 03it says "scaled and stretched"
<drfsupercenter> 03which implies that instead of 4:3 it'll be stretched to fill the top screen
<drfsupercenter> 03which is EW
<ctr> um... that's actually wrong
<SilverSonic> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03so it'll be pillarboxed?

<drfsupercenter> 03"the 3DS has a much bigger resolution than the DS"
<drfsupercenter> 03256 is not that much bigger than 192
<drfsupercenter> 03it's still disappointing :|
<junh1024-XD> its mod 32

<ctr> 400x320 is good enough for me
<drfsupercenter> 03my fricking cellphone has a better resolution than that piece of crap
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's smaller
<drfsupercenter> 03:|
<ctr> i just can't see the reason in implementing a retina screen on the 3DS where it just eats more battery life

<drfsupercenter> 03NO THANKS
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd expect to wake up finding my flash cards no longer working >_>
<ctr> it may be good....In japan only
<ctr> And there's a wireless switch on the side making this easy to turn off
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just saying the feature seems stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03plus what if I want wireless on but I don't want people updating my crap?

<drfsupercenter> 03THis review does seem fair
<drfsupercenter> 03but eh
<drfsupercenter> 03I really just think my DSi XL is the best thing so far XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah ;P
<ctr> i have a ds lite
<drfsupercenter> 03I have 3 DSes
<ctr> Won't keep it very long though
<drfsupercenter> 03DS Lite, DSi, DSi XL
<Umbreon> 12i have 2
<drfsupercenter> 03I refuse to give up my DS Lite
<HyperMetalLugia> GBA ;3
<drfsupercenter> 03because EW REMOVING THE GBA SLOT
<Umbreon> 12DS lite with a missing hinge, and a DSi
<drfsupercenter> 03And it's useful for more than just GBA games
<drfsupercenter> 03but using my Supercard Lite, I can dump DS ROMs and save files
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<ctr> I only have one GBA cartridge anyway, and I'm going to give it to my friend
<Umbreon> 12i misread dump
<Umbreon> 12x-x
<drfsupercenter> 03flash cards ;P
<drfsupercenter> 03though GBA sized flash cards are super hard to find now x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd love to find a store that still carries the non-rumble version of the Supercard Lite
<drfsupercenter> 03but so far I can't even find any
<drfsupercenter> 03meaning it's like impossible to replace if mine ever breaks :(O
<drfsupercenter> 03-O
<drfsupercenter> 03but for now it works and it works well
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the same size as the slot cover so it doesn't stick out any, uses a MicroSD card, and lets me play any GBA ROM I want *in* GBA mode, as well as run homebrew that reads from the DS slot
<drfsupercenter> 03I honestly prefer the DS Phat to the DS Lite but mine broke so I took what I could
<drfsupercenter> 03(Nintendo gave me a free DS Lite LOL)
<ctr> :P

<Jason> thats the price for canada
<HyperMetalLugia> Fail XD
<Ripred> 4it one hit my reshiram
<Ripred> 4and i was pwning it
<Charles> Honestly, even though i hear nothing but mixed results from them, I would say Acronis software is your best bet, as they are more readily available
<Ripred> 4but no worries! Pancake saved the day!
<Jason> hmm
<Charles> for the Cloning software i MEAN
<Charles> stupid caps lock
<Jason> whats a cheap hdd that you can find me thats decent with at least 150gb ?
<Jason> http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/168990_10150152795716281_589866280_8441209_4258828_n.jpg
<Jason> lol
<Ripred> 4ZOROARK WTF
<Ripred> 4did not see that coming
<Charles> honestly, never go for under 500 gigs. most of the time, any drive under that size is at most 10-20 dollars cheaper, and with that minimal of a difference, you might as well go the extra mile/kilometer
<Charles> I made the very same mistake and I am regretting it
<Charles> luckily I had aquired over 3 TB of external storage before hand
<Ripred> 4ffff
<Jason> hmm
<Ripred> 4this is not my lucky battle
<Jason> thanks :)

<drfsupercenter> 15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SPOILERS
<Charles> hmm, NAS is a bit tricky
<drfsupercenter> 03just stop talking about what's going on the game.
<Ripred> 4:|
<Charles> I myslef find it difficult to rank each product against each other because alot of them have wildly different features
<Charles> and in some cases a netbook can function as a NAS
<Jason> hmmmm
<Jason> screw the nas
<Charles> lemme look
<Jason> nah
<Jason> its alright

<Chimera> 04YES
<Chimera> 04:D
<Jason> there is definitely some bugs that they have to fix on it
<Charles> the torch is not terrible, but it is not much of a step up from the Curve
<Chimera> 04Good, Sparky :>
<Sparky> :D
<Jason> actually, the touch screen makes it 10 times better already
<SilverSonic> X3

<Yoshino> 2uhh

<Jason> mine is thin
<Jason> and looks nicer
<Jason> also the keyboard doesntg take up half the phone

<Yoshino> 2hi HML <:
<Charles> true
*HyperMetalLugia hugs :P
<Jason> :OO Would you like to buy a VPS off me?
<Jason> I am an authorised seller
<Charles> my EVO is leaps and bounds better than the blackberry I used to have though. Mine was pretty much one of the first Direct COnnect Blackberries
<Charles> VPS?
<Jason> yeah
<Charles> Server?
<Jason> virtual private server
<Jason> the cheapest one is $5/mo
<Jason> and i can get you a 10% off
<Charles> thought so, and nah, I have unrestricted access to my friends server, and I don't even use it
*Yoshino 2floats about
*Kyu ties a string to Yoshino
<Charles> I have absolutely no use for a server right now
<Jason> hmm
*Yoshino 2pours green tea all over Kyu
<Kyu> 07.-.
<Charles> and when I do need one, my server requirments will be so low that I can just turn my by then obsolete netbook into one
<Jason> hmm
<Yoshino> 2mmmm
<Jason> i have a server, but i get 20% off any vps i want
<Jason> so yeah
<SilverSonic> im bored D;
<Charles> http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=15160292
<Charles> my PC build
<SilverSonic> ;_;
<Yoshino> 2yeah
<Yoshino> 2same >:
<SilverSonic> :(
<Charles> I never got why people don't just make their own servers? I mean, certainly the explosion in demand for servers must be in the low data sector, so building one to fit that role would not be hard
<Jason> Yeah
<Jason> but going through all the hassle to build one vs paying $5/mo
<Jason> really isnt even comparable

<SilverSonic> drf: Friday by Rebecca Black .______.
<drfsupercenter> 03where did that song even come from

<SilverSonic> its the worst song
<SilverSonic> and Rebecca Black cant sing for crap
<SilverSonic> she's just horrible
<Presea> lol
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Umbreon> 12who is worse
<Umbreon> 12Black or Bieber
<SilverSonic> Exactly
<Presea> don't even know who rebecca black is
<Presea> don't really care either
<Presea> :x
<kurtroll> thats because you have no social interaction
<Presea> haven't been following youtube's so called culture
<Presea> ya i have more irl
<Presea> then on youtube
<kurtroll> did you know everyone irl is talking about it too?
<Presea> not around here
<Presea> well
<SilverSonic> if only that CSI Scene with Beiber was real
<kurtroll> not around here = your basement??
<SilverSonic> everyone would PARTAY
<SilverSonic> ;D
<Presea> i did hear that some random annooying girl got attention on youtube
<Presea> similar to that other guy
<Presea> justin something
<kurtroll> i mean how socially deprived are you if you dont even know about stuff on youtube
<Presea> it's what i call Choice
<Presea> i simply don't give a fuck?
<Presea> o.o
<kurtroll> it's a very very poor choice
<SilverSonic> LOL i posted a Poll on FB: Here's a Poll. Who's Worse: Rebecca Black or Justin Beiber?
<Presea> still living in texas btw
<kurtroll> if you're that ignorant, i don't think i should argue with you to change your mind
<kurtroll> maybe it's best you live alone.. o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03you use Facebook?
<Presea> o.o
<Presea> cool
<SilverSonic> yes
<SilverSonic> i have FB but i rarely do anything on it xD;

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL your profile pic
<SilverSonic> who do you live with? o3o
<kurtroll> well maybe your mom will leave soon and it'll just be you and your dad..
<SilverSonic> that would be my Sonic Character :3
<Presea> oh she might leave
<Presea> by death
<Presea> no joke she's been coughing up blood lately
<kurtroll> how would you know if you dont leave your basement...
<Presea> we don't have a basement
<Presea> so how's your basement
<Presea> you are a troll
<Presea> you lurk in one do you not
<Presea> or are you simply a fail troll
<kurtroll> i'm sorry but you have to be very strange to believe in mystical creatures such as trolls
<Presea> to be honest with you i don't care what you think about me i hate myself as is, and i don't like many ppl irl, however i do know alot of ppl
<Presea> but i will say this
<Presea> if you keep it up, i will probably shun you
<Presea> for attempting to make drama, which i will say is frowned upon here
<kurtroll> how am i attempting to make drama when you're providing so much stuff to "bash"
<SilverSonic> LOL im gonna probably get some major hate comments towards me for posting that poll
<SilverSonic> feel free to comment

<SilverSonic> for hilarious purposes
<Presea> i think if you don't like something it's better to ignore it
<SilverSonic> yeah
<SilverSonic> although if you want real laughs you'd check 27bslash6
<Presea> that's why i ignore youtube "pop culture"
<Presea> i don't like it
<SilverSonic> its hilarious the emails that he sends to random people
<Presea> however i do pay attention to other things
<SilverSonic> good goood

<Drake> 04:\
<Drake> 04Hey Bree
<Caaz> It's possible the password was changed
<Drake> 04Huh. That'd make sense.
<Caaz> I could probably find a new account eventually
<Drake> 04You mean you didn't have permission from the previous owner?
<Umbreon> 12how goes it

<drfsupercenter> 03how are you?
<drfsupercenter> 03there's like nobody on XD
<Yoshino> 2i'm pretty bored atm |:
<Yoshino> 2you?
<drfsupercenter> 03same
<drfsupercenter> 03just playing White
<Yoshino> 2oh
<Yoshino> 2i just got black and white a few days ago
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03have you started one?
<Yoshino> 2yeah
<Yoshino> 2i started black
<Yoshino> 2because i wanted reshiram lol
<drfsupercenter> 03nice
<drfsupercenter> 03White has better music :|
<Yoshino> 2i'm up to the fourth gym leader
<drfsupercenter> 03I went through the whole game up to the Elite Four without catching more than like 6 Pokémon
<drfsupercenter> 03just because I despise the crappy new ones
<drfsupercenter> 03I made up a team of first-generation ones and used them
<Yoshino> 2LOL
<Yoshino> 2the new ones just don't have the old pokemon feel into them
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/2Qpsg.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03more or less that
<Yoshino> 2LOL
<Umbreon> 12SOY
<Yoshino> 2breeeeee
<Presea> what about superfly repod
*Aristeo yawns
<nickstr> or just rehashing older ones but changing them a little bit
<Presea> dunno if that host is acceptable
<Presea> w/e
<Drake> 04?
*Umbreon gives soy some chocolate milk
<Caaz> Was never informed of any rules on hosts.
<Presea> repod's host
*Yoshino 2drinks
<Presea> you weren't?
<Presea> lol
<Caaz> Nope.
<Presea> nothing offensive
<Presea> :x
<Presea> but
<Presea> his isn't.. that bad
<Presea> so heh
<Presea> i mean like
<Presea> if you see a host that mocks someone
<Presea> reject it
<Caaz> Yeah I wouldn't accept that junk
<Presea> or something with alot of cussing
<nickstr> then again it seems like every generation has uninspired creatures
<nickstr> generation 5 seems to have the most
<Umbreon> 12at least they didn't take other guys
<Umbreon> 12and give them evolutions or baby forms
<Umbreon> 12like generations 2 and 4 did
<nickstr> for generation 2 that is when breeding was introduced so that was a given
<nickstr> generation 4 I have no idea why
<Umbreon> 12and i heard a rumor that Munna was actually going to originally be part of the generation 1 pokemon
<Umbreon> 12but eventually trashed the idea
<Umbreon> 12they recycled an idea
<Yoshino> 2i heard that rumor somewhere too |:
<Umbreon> 12well
<Umbreon> 12i heard the rumor from a friend
<Umbreon> 12he's marriland's brother
<Umbreon> 12marriland is kind of a big celebrity in the video game world
<Yoshino> 2lol
<Yoshino> 2i know that
<Umbreon> 12kyu has met him :P
<Yoshino> 2o:
<drfsupercenter> 03LOLwut\

<Umbreon> !define no results found
<Yoshino> 2LOL
<[TST]Bot> -!- No results found
<nickstr> I heard of Marriland
<nickstr> mostly negative stuff about his forums though
<Yoshino> 2why?
<Superflea> superfly
<Superflea> ;-;
<nickstr> mostly watermarking pictures or stealing them from somewhere else
<Yoshino> 2oh
<Umbreon> 12no community is perfect
<Umbreon> 12and only goes downhill after time
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> I have seen such a community
<nickstr> Bulbagarden
<nickstr> its gone downhill FAST
<nickstr> especially since some trolls have become moderators
<Yoshino> 2o:
<nickstr> and the moderators are as biased as heck
<nickstr> they let their bias get in the way of their duties
<Presea> yes
<Presea> superfly
<Presea> is probably more offensive then your host
<Presea> lol
<Umbreon> 12:/
<Umbreon> 12serebii is also bad
<nickstr> its WORSE
<nickstr> FAR WORSE
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Yoshino> 2lol
<nickstr> it got so bad that I decided to leave the community about a year ago
<Umbreon> 12oh
<nickstr> the worst part of it is the Pokemon anime section
<nickstr> when I left it was a warzone
<nickstr> people were flaming each other left and right
<Yoshino> 2|:
<nickstr> plus there were a huge number of banned topics
<nickstr> Bulbagarden is getting that way but the problem is nowhere near as big
<nickstr> its just a hand full of people causing the problem
<nickstr> but the moderators are so biased that nothing gets done
<nickstr> the problematic people don't get punished and just get to run free causing more problems
<nickstr> trolling and flaming infractions are tiny in point values comparing to what is required to get at least a one or two week ban
<nickstr> its easy to skirt the infraction system there no matter what you get in trouble with
<nickstr> just stay inactive until your infractions expire and your point value drops
<nickstr> thats really all you have to do and you can get away with ANYTHING
*Umbreon gives more chocolate milk
<Aristeo> BlueFusion|laptop!
*Yoshino 2drink
*drfsupercenter hands Yoshino an s key
<nickstr> I am a moderator on another forum where the infraction system in the case of trolling and flaming is far more harsh
<nickstr> basically trolling is a 30 point infraction that never expires
<nickstr> flaming is 10 or 15 points
<nickstr> plus a permanent ban is 30 points
<nickstr> but you can contest the ban and prove that you would be worthy of returning should that happen
<nickstr> because those of us there believe in mercy and second chances

<nickstr> 1980s 8 bit music on 1980s technology
<nickstr> actually mid to late 1970s
<Presea> hmm power's flickering
<Presea> oh fun hail
<ctr> 1980's sound technology is the FM Chips
<Aristeo> Kitten: how come?
<Aristeo> And I agree :3
<SilverSonic|RN|Live> Shiny-Ho-Oh has been idle 162hrs 24mins 3secs, signed on Sat Mar 12 19:55:11 <--- lmfao
<nickstr> true
<nickstr> but the technology that is making true stereo sound possible on my relay came to be in the 1970s
<HyperMetalLugia> How do you even see him
<HyperMetalLugia> WHERE
<Presea> lurking in a unreg'ed channel
<Presea> apparently
<Presea> ajoin probably failed
<ctr> The first video games with stereo sound came out in the late 80's iirc
<Presea> also it's sleeting not hailing
<Presea> here
<Presea> x_x
<nickstr> when the 16 bit systems came to be
<nickstr> although 8 bit systems could do stereo as well

<nickstr> thing
<ctr> Yeah
<nickstr> although I could have sworn the Game Gear had sound chips developed by Yamaha

<HyperMetalLugia> O.o

<Prince-dari> If running an IRC client affects your FPS get a new computer?
<ctr> I plan to
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> X
<HyperMetalLugia> D
<ctr> But i'll be broke after the 3DS.
<ctr> I actually don't prefer icechat too, i use KVIrc on my laptop
<nickstr> no need, that is what I have a compresser/limiter for
<nickstr> making sure that I don't have distortion
<Aristeo> It looks really good Spyrorocks
<Aristeo> It's professional, but not boring
<nickstr> unlike what many do and use processing to add distortion
<nickstr> the FM stations like to sound loud and distort badly along with totally destroying your ear drums if you listen with headphones or earbuds
<nickstr> or a good sound system
<ctr> They don't know how to use AGC
<nickstr> or don't use it at all
<nickstr> I use an AGC on my setup
<nickstr> along with light processing
<ctr> I have a pretty good AGC setup on my show...
<nickstr> I actually have two AGCs
<nickstr> one just before the compressor/limiter and one before the output
<ctr> With SAM's default AGC settings, 8-bit songs sounds distorted
<nickstr> so you had to tailor it yourself
<nickstr> I had to do the same
<ctr> Yes
<lightumbreon> heya GL
<nickstr> the attack and decay was fine but I needed a bit more in terms of level
<NightSeas> 12Hello lightumbreon!
<nickstr> sometimes the higher end treble can cause distortion too
<nickstr> and we are at two hours and four minutes
<ctr> The show started 2 hours and 36 minutes ago
<nickstr> I started my relay of it a bit late
<lightumbreon> WB SheenaFox
<SheenaFox> thanks lightumbreon
<ctr> There is a radio nintendo chatroom on another server
<nickstr> what did you have to adjust for the AGC
<nickstr> just the levels or attack and decay as well
<SilverSonic|RN|Live> heh, i dun use SAM Broadcaster
<SilverSonic|RN|Live> just winamp with SAM Encoders
<nickstr> I have Winamp with Stereo Tool for over the air
<ctr> Winamp is a good broadcasting tool. Often you don't even need to set AGC to broadcast
<nickstr> a highly flexable processor
<nickstr> it works with AM, AM stereo, FM, FM stereo
<nickstr> and on FM has RDS encoding (dynamic scrolling text and radio text) along with SCA in the newer beta version
<nickstr> also for FM mono transmitters FM stereo multiplex encoding
<nickstr> you can build a very simple two transistor FM transmitter and use Stereo Tool for generating stereo and RDS along with premphasis
<nickstr> oh wow, Pokemon stuff can be requested too?
<ctr> And then the FCC will come knocking your door
<nickstr> no
<nickstr> these transmitters are legal under part 15 of the FCC rules and regulations

<ctr> Anyway, in sweden unlicensed FM transmitters can only have a range of 3-4 meters
<auscompgeek> XD
<nickstr> well I guess if I am not too late maybe an 8 bit Pokemon tune
<lightumbreon> XD
<nickstr> its longer in the US
<HyperMetalLugia> WB
<ctr> The government did go crazy about those MP3 players with built in FM transmitters but then allowed them...with that limitation
<Zapdos> o.o
<nickstr> AM transmitters in the US have a power limit but no real range limit
<nickstr> you are limited to 100 milliwatts of power and an antenna of eight feet long
<nickstr> transmitter grounds are legal though
<HyperMetalLugia> B000000000000000
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<nickstr> you laugh at this but bear in mind many part 15 legal AM transmitters can cover four miles

<drfsupercenter> 03yay, I now have all of Pokémon season 4 on DVD
<nickstr> so do I
<drfsupercenter> 03NTSC ones
<nickstr> does not matter
<nickstr> yours are f*** rare
<nickstr> and far outside my price range
<nickstr> plus the Magna Pacific box sets are an infinately better deal
<nickstr> $50 vs $500
<nickstr> no wait, not even 500 more like $1,000
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<drfsupercenter> 03and even so the NTSC ones are NTSC so there's no crap telecining
<drfsupercenter> 03I ONLY collect American DVD releases
<nickstr> I don't care
<nickstr> I still have them
<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<nickstr> and they are far more easily obtained
<nickstr> you don't have to deal with scalpers
<nickstr> sure they are PAL who freaking cares
<nickstr> they are EASIER TO FIND
<nickstr> which is far more important than "TV system compliance"
<Vaporeon> ok
<drfsupercenter> 03these aren't hard to find either, they're just hard to find for a good price :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but I spent less than $50 on each
<nickstr> again
<nickstr> SCALPERS
<drfsupercenter> 03so that's less than $350 total
<drfsupercenter> 03dude
<drfsupercenter> 03$40 for 7 episodes isn't that bad
<nickstr> I paid $50 for the ENTIRE FOURTH SEASON
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like $3ish an episode
<nickstr> its really bad
<drfsupercenter> 03OK well I only want NTSC releases
<nickstr> you got a crappy deal
<nickstr> you basically got ripped off
<nickstr> all because of your stupid bias
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not bias
<drfsupercenter> 03I collect region 1 POkémon DVDs
<drfsupercenter> 03what you have isn't that
<drfsupercenter> 03and therefore doesn't count
<nickstr> it still counts
<nickstr> they are still official licensed releases
<nickstr> who cares if they are NTSC or not

<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But that story too felt a little...rushed

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Have you played the entire game nickstr?
<drfsupercenter> 035th generation sucks enough that having put up with that crap is just unbearable
<Ripred> 4im pretty sure poofing a pokemon to level 100 is cheating
<drfsupercenter> 03I hacked in 1st gens
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yet...
<drfsupercenter> 03but they were all normal levels, not super hacked or naything
<Ripred> 4i caught 1st gens
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02tons of people sucked it up and beared through the game
<Ripred> 4and transfered the rest
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You big baby :P

<Jason> damn

<Jason> maybe next year
<Ripred> 4POS?
<SilverSonic> i got bored..
*HyperMetalLugia flees
<Revy> 「11:43:10pm」 <SilverSonic> i swear i see that "trollface.jpg" alot
<Revy> 3>Implying it's not well known
<HyperMetalLugia> Piece of @sh@t
<Ripred> 4oh
<SilverSonic> o_o'
<nickstr> its like they are trying to repel people from Pokemon
<SilverSonic> o~o
<Zapdos> i prefer awesomeface
<Ripred> 4finally got my lugia and articuno over onto my black ;D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You're the ones repelling yourselves from the games
<nickstr> by making all these stupid restrictions
<Ripred> 4nickstr, only some of you
<Zapdos> hi lightrai
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Like?
<Ripred> 4i really enjoyed the game
<Ripred> 4so stop whining
<nickstr> I have pretty much hated EVERYTHING I have heard about generation 5
<Ripred> 4ok thats great
<nickstr> except Politoed gaining some useful stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03Shiny-Growlithe like turning White Forest/Black City into Animal Crossing
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah, what you've heard
<Umbreon> 12i hate going through victory road
<Ripred> 4animal crossing lol
<nickstr> you can't polish a turd
<drfsupercenter> 03why are you guys defending the game?
<Ripred> 4i remember that
<HyperMetalLugia> Lalwls
<nickstr> and that turd is Black and White
<drfsupercenter> 03whether you like the Pokémon or not is your own choice
<HyperMetalLugia> *lawls
<Ripred> 4YOU cant polish a turd
<drfsupercenter> 03but there's really no point in being Nintendo's polcie here
<drfsupercenter> 03*police
<Ripred> 4i sure as hell can apperently
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because we can't even talk about it without you coming in and saying how stupid it is
<drfsupercenter> 03did I start it?
<drfsupercenter> 03No
<drfsupercenter> 03you guys just have issues
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah, but you sure have to be the one to make it worse
<drfsupercenter> 03if someone says something negative about something you like everyone gets all butthurt about everything
<Ripred> 4i agree with shiny, we started talking and you guys started raging
<HyperMetalLugia> Baww, we are so 100% )n0t( right
<drfsupercenter> 03Not really, I was just agreeing with nickstr
<Umbreon> 12i picked random guys and made them 100s XD
<Ripred> 4i asked somthing about black city
<Ripred> 4and everyone rages on 5th gen
<drfsupercenter> 03no, I was just pointing out how they made Black City into Animal Crossing
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If everyone can have their own opinions, then why are you questioning why we are defending the game?
<Ripred> 4i have maybe 2 lvl 100. but they are LEGIT
<nickstr> I thought about getting White but now I guess not
<Ripred> 4then dont
<nickstr> I will wait and see what happens in the third version
<nickstr> assuming there will be one
<Umbreon> 12Ripred
<Ripred> 4zebra verson!
<Ripred> 4yes?
<Umbreon> 12the only game i had patience to build up 6 100s
<Umbreon> 12was in ruby
<HyperMetalLugia> Where is allmight Espeon when we need them
<Ripred> 4with blitzle as the mascot
<Umbreon> 12because of secret bases XD
<drfsupercenter> 03<Shiny-Growlithe> If everyone can have their own opinions, then why are you questioning why we are defending the game? <- because I'm just stating my opinions, I'm not trying to force them on anyone
<HyperMetalLugia> <3
<Umbreon> 12i'd always trade my pokemon over to another version
<drfsupercenter> 03you guys on the other hand...
<HyperMetalLugia> I loved those
<Ripred> 4i loved the secret bases
<Umbreon> 12record break, trade them back then make them battle themselves
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Said what?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, Emerald was like the best Pokémon game ever
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02"You have to like the game or else!"?
<drfsupercenter> 03it all went downhill from there
<HyperMetalLugia> ^Yup
<drfsupercenter> 03no, but you seemed to be having a problem with what I was saying
<HyperMetalLugia> It's like people saying Ew Chrome or IE ;3
<HyperMetalLugia> I just deal with it
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<drfsupercenter> 03indeed
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't have a problem with IE :P
<Ripred> 4i like my IE
<drfsupercenter> 03I just prefer Firefox
<HyperMetalLugia> But Ew FF 4?
<drfsupercenter> 03correct :P
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because drf, you basically said what I liked wasn't as good as yours
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, way too chromy x.x
<nickstr> unless there is a way to cheat the clock so more people can be in the White forest or Black City when I finish even if its not within four days then I don't know about even starting
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/mozilla-firefox-4.jpg < Ohai chrome~
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr, well, you can change the clock back
<drfsupercenter> 03you just have to be perfect about it
<drfsupercenter> 03er not perfect
<drfsupercenter> 03careful
<drfsupercenter> 03if you accidentally save it after midnight without setting the clock back
<Umbreon> 12wo
<Umbreon> 12wow
<HyperMetalLugia> FF looked too much like IE7/8 at first for me, now it's looking like GC :(
<Umbreon> 12i can actually swallow now
<HyperMetalLugia> What happens then?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Right right
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay Umbreon :3
<Umbreon> 12to an extend
<Umbreon> 12extent
<nickstr> sounds too touchy
<Ripred> 4i have a swallow
<drfsupercenter> 03<Shiny-Growlithe> Because drf, you basically said what I liked wasn't as good as yours <- which is again someone getting too hellbent over something that doesn'teven concern them personally
<Umbreon> 12!fight Ripred
*ScriptBot uses Aromatherapy on Ripred! Ripred gains 365 HP! Ripred has 1169 HP left!
<drfsupercenter> 03and woah
*HyperMetalLugia nearly types /server -m tailow
<drfsupercenter> 03I just noticed another Tron reference in Tron Legacy
<HyperMetalLugia> Where :o
<Ripred> 4o_o
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<Umbreon> 12!fight Ripred
<drfsupercenter> 03When they shoot off fireworks
*ScriptBot uses Double-Edge on Ripred! It's not very effective... Ripred loses 27 HP! Ripred has 1142 HP left!
<drfsupercenter> 03they're in the shape of Bit
<nickstr> the clock thing sounds very touchy
<drfsupercenter> 03from the first movie
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Tbh what I like and dislike is personal
<HyperMetalLugia> Bit :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes!
<Ripred> 4!fight umbreon
*ScriptBot uses Scratch on umbreon! umbreon loses 173 HP! umbreon has 824 HP left!
<HyperMetalLugia> No..
<HyperMetalLugia> Yesyesyesesyesy
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Fine, so you like something better than I do
<Umbreon> 12nooo
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah Bit is cool XD
<drfsupercenter> 03here lemme find a screenshot XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Doesn't mean that what you like is better than my likes
<HyperMetalLugia> OKay
<Aristeo> o.o
*Aristeo curls up next to Kitten
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because IMO it feels like you're saying "Well I'm just better than you."
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said it was, but there's no reason to get hellbent over me not liking 5th gen Pokémon
<nickstr> I might just hack a few which are level 30, 50, and 100 to be in my team
<nickstr> and generation 1 or 2 of course
<drfsupercenter> 03the only people who have the right to take offense to that is the people who created them
<Ripred> 4im secretly part of game freak
<Ripred> 4im offended
<HyperMetalLugia> So SG created Gen 5
<Ripred> 4 8D
<HyperMetalLugia> Explains why it'
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I don't care about you not liking the 5th gen
<Umbreon> 12you are not Ripred :P
*Jason curls up next to Aristeo
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/wQNo6.jpg
<Ripred> 4you dont know that!!
<drfsupercenter> 03there look at the top right firework
<drfsupercenter> 03see how it kinda resembles Bit?
<HyperMetalLugia> Panty :oi
<HyperMetalLugia> Whaa
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02To me, when you say these things it's like you're saying "You're stupid for even liking something from there
<SilverSonic> where Stocking
<SilverSonic> _
<Aristeo> :)
<Zapdos> hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03well that's just you misinterpreting what I'm saying then
<HyperMetalLugia> New CGI- Yes!
<Zapdos> why not take the nick
<HyperMetalLugia> We need moar Scanty
<Mikey> can we pretend these shorts are a hamburger because I'm fucking hungry
<Zapdos> it's not being used
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL HML you haven't seen Tron Legacy?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I didn't interpret anything, it's just what I feel like you're saying to me
<Ripred> 4i never saw it
<drfsupercenter> 03well I'm not
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes I have XD
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Zapdos> scanty
<HyperMetalLugia> I saw it when it came out on a rip
<drfsupercenter> 03Ripred you should
<Zapdos> orly
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Then what are you saying?
<HyperMetalLugia> Online XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but you should see the original Tron first
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just saying that I hate 5th gen
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not attacking you personally
<HyperMetalLugia> Like 50 times Ripred
*HyperMetalLugia also notes he was talking from Bit's point of view XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Well, now you know why I was defending myself, because I did take a personal hit
<Lambda> Hungry for clothing?
<HyperMetalLugia> Kneesocks and her ruuuuuuuuruuuuuu~
<nickstr> its like the people at Game Freak assume people who play the Pokemon games don't have lives outside of them
<drfsupercenter> 03oh I see XD
<drfsupercenter> 03@ HML
<Mikey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdY9OKjw-2A
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Umbreon> 12chimy :D
<drfsupercenter> 03and man, this scene prolly has the best done music in the movie
<Chimera> Hi :3
<drfsupercenter> 03when they're all on the lightcycles
<Umbreon> 12hi
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Well Game Freak assumed right about me
<Jason> nommm
<nickstr> finishing in four days is difficult if you have other things to do
<Ripred> 4tthats not true nickstr
<HyperMetalLugia> Glasscycles now (maybe even transparentcycles
<Ripred> 4they just want to make it difficult
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Not to mention, what other lives do kids have nowadays besides playing video gams?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02games*
<Ripred> 4not somthing you can finish in a week
<Stocking_> XD
<nickstr> younger players have homework and school, older players have jobs and in some cases families
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the point
<Stocking> :3
<Ripred> 4you're supposed to work on it over a long time
<Stocking> oh Panty~
<drfsupercenter> 03Ripred
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah?
<Stocking> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03you don't get it
<Stocking> jk
<Ripred> 4orly?
<drfsupercenter> 03you're supposed to work on it over a long time, but the game penalizes you for taking too long
<nickstr> having a time based White Forest or Black City gets in the way of that
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Two words:
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Spring Break
<drfsupercenter> 03because if you take more than 4 days, you permanently lose people
<Ripred> 4>_<
<Zapdos> lol
*HyperMetalLugia ties Stocking up and shocks her
<Ripred> 4no you dont
<Ripred> 4you get them back
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes you do
<Ripred> 4through entralink
<drfsupercenter> 03Ripred don't argue with me on this
<junh1024-XD> ohai Chimera, have you used motion, shake, or other compositing packages apart from AFX ?
*Castaway is now away: gone (00:08:29)
<Ripred> 4entralink
<drfsupercenter> 03I know how the game works
<Ripred> 4you get more
<drfsupercenter> 03and no, the entralink doesn't help
<drfsupercenter> 03Ripred
<Ripred> 4orly?
<drfsupercenter> 03you have to know someone else with the game for that to work
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I have not heard of you losing people, like who?
<Ripred> 4and?
<Castaway> cya
<drfsupercenter> 03and not all of us know people IRL with the game
<drfsupercenter> 03Shiny-Growlithe
<drfsupercenter> 03did you beat the E4?
<Ripred> 4and not really
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yup
<Ripred> 4i just go to school with my c-gear on
<drfsupercenter> 03which version?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02White
<Ripred> 4in the lunch room there are like 20 people playing
<drfsupercenter> 03How many people with names do you have in White Forest
<Ripred> 4i can just do it there
<SilverSonic> !ew ARK Music Factory
<drfsupercenter> 15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ARK MUSIC FACTORY
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02About 10-20 I assume
<drfsupercenter> 03Ripred well I';m in college
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Never counted
<drfsupercenter> 03...
*Zapdos pokes hypermetallugia
<drfsupercenter> 03no.
<drfsupercenter> 03there's 10 MAX
<drfsupercenter> 03I only have 4
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and I beat the game in maybe a week?
<Chimera> Drf
<drfsupercenter> 03meaning I lost 6 for taking too long
<Ripred> 4i have like 10 and i beat it yesterday..
<Chimera> Not everyone has no friends
*Chimera runs
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I definitely have more than that
<drfsupercenter> 03It's not that I have no friends
<Ripred> 4lol chimera xD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's that nobody here actually plays it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I beat the game in a week as well
<HyperMetalLugia> Just wondering who you were :3
<Chimera> Well
<Chimera> :/
*HyperMetalLugia gives cookiess
<drfsupercenter> 03because all my friends agree with me that BW is a piece of crap
<Umbreon> 12i'm cruel
<Chimera> Then go pro
<drfsupercenter> 03at least the actual Pokémon
<Chimera> And
<Umbreon> 12i got the victini event on white
<Chimera> Lol
<Umbreon> 12and just making the delivery guy sit out there
<drfsupercenter> 03the game's only acceptable if you use older Pokémon to beat them XD
<Chimera> No it isn't
<drfsupercenter> 03orly
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I have 10
<Chimera> yes -_-
<drfsupercenter> 03Shiny-Growlithe, 10 people *with names*?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh now you tell me ffs
<drfsupercenter> 03there are random people standing there that don't have names
<drfsupercenter> 03I did say it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'd say about 4 or 5
<Chimera> Umbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03> How many people with names do you have in White Forest <- first time I asked
<Chimera> Lolwhy xD
<drfsupercenter> 03I said "with names"
<junh1024-XD> Chimera ; have you used motion, shake, or other compositing packages apart from AFX ?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah, the shadow is over it
<Chimera> No
<Chimera> o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03and Shiny-Growlithe, that means you lost 5 or 6 people because yout ook too long to beat hte game
<drfsupercenter> 03now do you see what my problem is?
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No
<drfsupercenter> 03when those people leave
<drfsupercenter> 03they take with them the chance to buy items and catch gen 1-4 Pokémon
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03and they never come back
<Chimera> Oh no
<Chimera> No gen 1-4 pokemon
<Chimera> And items I can get other places
<HyperMetalLugia> That's horrible :(
<Chimera> OH HOW WILL I LIVE?!
<drfsupercenter> 03Using pokesav doesn't count >_>
<HyperMetalLugia> You can't!
<Chimera> OH WAIT
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Then I only see part of your problem
<Chimera> I HAVE MY PREVIOUS GAME
<Chimera> and drf
<Chimera> Yes you can
<Ripred> 4PSSST
<Ripred> 4dont fiddle with the clock too much
<drfsupercenter> 03there are ways to get them back if you know someone with the opposite version of the game and they have lost their people as well
<Chimera> That's just a mass collection of items in one place
<Ripred> 4for black and whit
<Ripred> 4e
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I wouldn't think you would care since you seem to be the person to hack any other Pokemon in
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Ripred> 4apperently it deserts the city/forest
<drfsupercenter> 03I only hacked them in right at the beginning because there was no other way to do it
<Chimera> And you're stubborn
*Chimera runs
<drfsupercenter> 03my problem is that the game actually penalizes you for taking too long to beat it
<drfsupercenter> 03which is just f***ing retarded
<drfsupercenter> 03there's no good reason for that
<nickstr> it is
<Chimera> Yeah
<Chimera> I think that was a mistake
<Chimera> Like
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not a mistake
<drfsupercenter> 03it was intentional
<nickstr> maybe the two of us should write letters to Game Freak and Nintendo saying why its a bad idea
<Chimera> Eh
<HyperMetalLugia> It's like you not getting stars in mario if you don't beat the level with a certain amount of coins :(
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<nickstr> I already have some good points to make
<Chimera> You have proof of that?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL nickstr, the game's already out, it's not lik eit'll matter
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera, go ask bluesun
<nickstr> it will because there will most likely be a third version
<Chimera> Yes because he's god
<drfsupercenter> 03if it was documented in both the Japanese and ENglish version o the game
*Chimera runs
<drfsupercenter> 03*of
<drfsupercenter> 03then that doesn't seem like a mistake to me
<Chimera> Oh wow
<drfsupercenter> 03he has both games
<drfsupercenter> 03imported Japanaese
<drfsupercenter> 03and English
<drfsupercenter> 03and they both have that
<drfsupercenter> 03the time based thing
<drfsupercenter> 03They wanted to keep it "fresh", but IMO it's just stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03NOW
<drfsupercenter> 03If they had that clock start AFTER you reach White Forest for the first time
<Chimera> .>
<drfsupercenter> 03that might be acceptable
<Chimera> >.>
<drfsupercenter> 03but they don't
<drfsupercenter> 03so
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not
<junh1024-XD> so chime, instead of making a proper aurora in AFX, since I don't know how to, i Made wan out of text: http://i.imgur.com/DGuM6.png
<Chimera> Yes
<Chimera> That's what I meant drf
<HyperMetalLugia> Keeping fresh by making you restart your file when you goof ;3
<Chimera> If it started after your first visit to White Forest/Black City
<Chimera> But
<Chimera> They didn't have that happen
<Chimera> >A>
<drfsupercenter> 03well go talk to bluesun, I think he knows why the game does that
<drfsupercenter> 03whether it was a mistake or not
<drfsupercenter> 03it's still messed up
<drfsupercenter> 03and is one of my biggest beefs with the game
<Chimera> Heh
<drfsupercenter> 03because now I permanently lost 6 people from my White City
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Chimera> That's an understa-
<Chimera> White FOREST
*Chimera runs
<drfsupercenter> 03and I don't know anyone else IRL who has it
<drfsupercenter> 03I know a few kids who just use emulators
<drfsupercenter> 03but that doesn't help
<Chimera> That's understandable though
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh gosh
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'd bet on my emulator
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I lost everone XD
<drfsupercenter> 03at least on the emulator
<drfsupercenter> 03you can mess with the date
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Chimera> Yep :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but I hate DS emulation
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah, but it's been 4 months now LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just not the same experience
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why I have a flash cart
<drfsupercenter> 03so I can pirate games on the actual DS hardware :)
<Chimera> Lolz
<Chimera> Yep
<Chimera> But
<drfsupercenter> 03plus save states FTW?
<Chimera> It feels better with the actual copy
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<Chimera> Because
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I have B/W
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I guess it's a speed gamer challenge
<drfsupercenter> 03because those are kinda hard to use on flash cards
<Chimera> Yay hardware enhancements and stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03without massive patching
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But I could care less, I'll just take my time with the game
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But now
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Chimera> Shiny
<drfsupercenter> 03eh nvm
<Chimera> Just connect with someone lol
<drfsupercenter> 03don't feel like getting into it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I shall be forever haunted of who those last 5-6 people/Pokemon would've been
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera
<Chimera> Lolz
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not that simple
<Ripred> 4drf, how do you convert an iso to a rom?
<drfsupercenter> 03bluesun told me you need like 2-3 people
<Chimera> How isn't it?
<drfsupercenter> 03that have it
<Lullabye> tired
<Chimera> o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03AND
<drfsupercenter> 03those people have to have people who left as well
<Chimera> The hell?
<Chimera> Wait
<Chimera> No
<drfsupercenter> 03meaning they'd have to have their games going for a while
<Chimera> That makes sense :P
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Well it's a good thing that we're on a Pokemon forum huh?
<drfsupercenter> 03Ripred, wait what
<drfsupercenter> 03well Shiny-Growlithe you have to know them IRL
<TerrorBite> Rawr
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh well then
<drfsupercenter> 03as the Entralink thing only works with local
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah it's stupid
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02if my friend gets it
<Zapdos> rawr
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02She'll beat it
<drfsupercenter> 03I might start a Black save right now and just leave it going for a few weeks
<Chimera> Entralink is local
<Chimera> But
<Chimera> WHY?!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02in about a month or two
<drfsupercenter> 03dunno
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I could probably just steal off hers then
<drfsupercenter> 03again, it's retarded
<drfsupercenter> 03D
<drfsupercenter> 03*XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Ripred> 4it was stupid that entralink is loca
<drfsupercenter> 03it's kinda a catch 22
<Ripred> 4l
<Chimera> Yes
<Chimera> I mean
<TerrorBite> :3
<drfsupercenter> 03you can steal their Black CIty/White Forest people
<Lullabye> >>
<drfsupercenter> 03but then YOU have them, and THEY don't
<drfsupercenter> 03or they can steal yours

<Lullabye> she keeps meowing at me, and swatting at my ankles when i walk by her
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't even hack those people back in
<Chimera> Entralink could have easily been online
<Zapdos> lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ok Dream World really needs to come now
<drfsupercenter> 03if I open up my save data in pokesav
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I

<drfsupercenter> 03x.x
<Arsenic> but im reading for school

<drfsupercenter> 03it would be awesome if you could
<Chimera> Aww xD
<Zapdos> my friend has a cat that will get in the way of your screen, or step on your keyboard to get your attention
<Chimera> Yep
<drfsupercenter> 03and DP Pokesav has been out for years
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's never been udpated
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah, you can only have it for so long
<Chimera> Owch
<drfsupercenter> 03so the chance of BW's being updated is equally low
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03Shiny-Growlithe
<drfsupercenter> 03with Chatot, it blurs your voice
<drfsupercenter> 03so youc an't like, shout profanity

<Prince-dari> Wow.
<drfsupercenter> 03but there's no way of doing so
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Chimera> Lulz
<Prince-dari> You shouldn't have done that.
<Prince-dari> I shouldn't have?
<Prince-dari> You shouldn't have done that.
<Prince-dari> I don't know.
<Prince-dari> You shouldn't have done that.
<Prince-dari> YOU shouldn't have done that, BEN.
<Zapdos> idk about that
<Aristeo> :3
<Chimera> You know, Nintendo made stuff that could have worked if done differently
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Chimera> I wonder why they didn't...
<drfsupercenter> 03That's Nintendo's problem
<drfsupercenter> 03"This COULD be so much better"
<drfsupercenter> 03but it never is
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03the 3DS is the same way
<drfsupercenter> 03I looked at the tech specs for it
<drfsupercenter> 03HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
<Chimera> Yes :/
<Chimera> How about
<Chimera> Nintendo makes games
<drfsupercenter> 03if someone wants to buy me a 3DS...
<Chimera> SEGA makes hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03but otherwise I probably won't get it XD
<Chimera> For Nintendo's games
<TerrorBite> oh I hate that Zapdos
*Chimera runs
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I only want to get a 3DS for the games
<HyperMetalLugia> LO
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03what games?
<nickstr> then I think we would win
<Zapdos> ya
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If they work on regular DSs then I'd be happy
<drfsupercenter> 03There are no good launch date titles
<HyperMetalLugia> Shouldn't it be the other way around ;3
<Chimera> That would work perfecty though
<Zapdos> let's say your talking on an IM when they do it
<nickstr> unlike Nintendo Sega did not come up short on hardware
<Chimera> No HML .-.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Mainly just one game that is only a rumor
<Zapdos> you suddenly go ASLFDKJjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Pokemon Snap 2
<Chimera> Lolz
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, Sega's always had the upper hand in hardware
<Chimera> yes
<drfsupercenter> 03the Genesis was a lot better than the SNES
<Chimera> With
<Chimera> BLAST PROSSING
<nickstr> they were always innovative and always pushed the technology of game systems forward
<Zapdos> :x
<Chimera> *runs*
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03just that the SNES had better games
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Now I want to play Pokemon Snap
*Shiny-Growlithe sobs
<drfsupercenter> 03other than Sonic there was like nothing good for Genesis LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03Shiny-Growlithe
<HyperMetalLugia> I perfer SNES because of the games :3
<Chimera> SEGA also wasn't all "GRAHH CHEAT GENIE"
<drfsupercenter> 03did you get Snap on Wii?
<Lambda> O.o
<Chimera> ...
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No, I can't buy things on the Wii
<nickstr> Nintendo has always lagged behind
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I have no money LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03you should
<drfsupercenter> 03because
<nickstr> example being color portables
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It's awesome? :P
<Chimera> drfsupercenter: other than Sonic there was like nothing good for Genesis LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03they actually made a couple changes to it
<Chimera> Horrible lie
<Chimera> HORRIBLE
<Chimera> LIE
<drfsupercenter> 03so instead of straight emulation
<nickstr> Nintendo did not come out with a color portable system until 1998
<drfsupercenter> 03if you hit the - key
<drfsupercenter> 03it posts the pictures you took to your Wii
<Chimera> Rocket Knight Adventures :c
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Chimera> Then again
<Chimera> That's one game
<drfsupercenter> 03also who said anything about paying>?
<nickstr> but they were ALREADY beaten by Atari, NEC, and Sega
<drfsupercenter> 03just install Homebrew Channel
<drfsupercenter> 03and use the WAD installer
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Prince-dari> That's funny/weird because of some creepy pasta.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm so scared to though D:
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<drfsupercenter> 03if you do it right it's fine
<Chimera> Hm
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Exactly!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I can't do anything right .-.
<Chimera> Who wants to modify history
<Zapdos> heh reminds me of that skype status icon with the pencel, it can turn into a cat sometimes if you have gibberish on the screen
<Chimera> Go back in time
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Prince-dari> It must have got it from people using it.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I hacked my Wii back when it was Twilight Hack
<drfsupercenter> 03which was like the easiest thing ever
<Chimera> And make SEGA do the hardware stuff instead?
<drfsupercenter> 03now it's a bit more complicated
*Chimera hides
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera, just make me a time machine
<HyperMetalLugia> I did bannerbomb
<Chimera> And you'll do what :V
<HyperMetalLugia> Destroy apple
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And while you're at it, make me a sandwich
<drfsupercenter> 03Bannerbomb was easy too but that no longer works either
<Chimera> Of course
<Chimera> Wait
<HyperMetalLugia> Then paradox
<Chimera> It doesn't?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Chimera> Oh wait no
<drfsupercenter> 03the newest Wii system menu broke it again
<Chimera> It doesn't ;-;
<Chimera> Well
<drfsupercenter> 03this time for good
<Chimera> Drf
<drfsupercenter> 03now you have to use some other thing
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes ;.;
<nickstr> plus the Gameboy Color sucked in terms of its screen
<Chimera> Guess what :3
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<Chimera> Brawl
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Chimera> It has a permanant exploit
<Chimera> Yay~
<HyperMetalLugia> Stacksmash ;D
<Chimera> ^
<Chimera> No
<nickstr> the colors looked washed out and dull
<Chimera> Smash stack
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<nickstr> it was a HUGE disappointment
<drfsupercenter> 03same idea
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Chimera> Stacksmash is a texture hacking team LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03that was the thing with Nintendo
<drfsupercenter> 03they tend to have better games
<Chimera> Yes ><
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't even have brawl
<drfsupercenter> 03GBC had lots of good games even though the hardware wasn't as good as the Game Gear
<nickstr> my Game Gear from 1993 had better graphics and better color quality
<Chimera> SEGA makes better hardware
<Chimera> But
<Chimera> Worse games
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh well
<drfsupercenter> 03MADE better hardware
<Chimera> Nowadays at least
*Shiny-Growlithe just watches an LP of the game
<Chimera> Dude
<Chimera> They'd STILL make better hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03well I know
<drfsupercenter> 03but they don't make hardware anymore
<Chimera> True

<Umbreon> 12it was grunt in N's castle drf
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Chimera> Team Rocket, team Galactic... They were too conspicuous.
<Umbreon> 12i think team rocket was the best of the group
<Chimera> That's why their plans werte always thwarted."
<Umbreon> 12best of the bunch
<Chimera> *were
<Chimera> And kinda
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera that's just based on a fan translation
<Umbreon> 122nd is either team plasma, 3rd was team galactic
<Chimera> No
<drfsupercenter> 03there's like over 9000 different ways to translate Japanese

<drfsupercenter> 03organized crime = "terrorists"
<Umbreon> 12team rocket
<Umbreon> 12didn't have some sort of single minded motivation
<Chimera> Nope
<Umbreon> 12they were just "crime, crime, and more crime"
<Chimera> Wait
<Umbreon> 12that's why i liked them
<Chimera> Yeah
<Chimera> They wanted to just take over Sliph and be jearks
<Umbreon> 12all the other teams
<Umbreon> 12were a one trick pony with a goal in mind
<Chimera> Magma and Aqua wanted to expand the pand/water
<Umbreon> 12which irritated me
<Chimera> *land
<Umbreon> 12pand

<Nightshadow|VNC> peer, you have been revived! You have 1000 HP.
<peer> k
<nickstr> its a small radio station on the east coast
<nickstr> the station runs AM stereo
<nickstr> as I said many people don't know of the technology
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<nickstr> so the shock factor is hilarious
<drfsupercenter> 03I like FM better
<drfsupercenter> 03it just sounds a lot better to me
<nickstr> not me
<drfsupercenter> 03plus the AM stations here suck
<drfsupercenter> 03they're all talk
<drfsupercenter> 03FM has like, music XD
<nickstr> blah blah blah
<nickstr> talk
<nickstr> some AM stations run music
<drfsupercenter> 03not in my area
<nickstr> not that you know of
<nickstr> CFCO 600
<drfsupercenter> 03well there's 630, that's it
<nickstr> yea
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's like fricking classic
<drfsupercenter> 03*classica
<drfsupercenter> 03*CLASSICAL:
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's niothing I like
<nickstr> really
<drfsupercenter> 03*nothing
<drfsupercenter> 03there are no top 40 AM stations
<nickstr> I thought they were oldies
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<nickstr> KCJJ
<nickstr> Iowa City
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno
<nickstr> 1630 KHz
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe they are
<drfsupercenter> 03haven't listened to 630 AM since I was like 8 LOL
<nickstr> I actually contacted the owner of KCJJ through e-mail before
<nickstr> its really a horse of a different color that is for sure
<drfsupercenter> 03I contacted some Channel 955 people via email
<Armageddon> ...can you please not spam, Ragnarok? You of all people should know better than that :|
<nickstr> hearing Gwen Stefani, Lady GaGa, The Gin Blossums, James Blunt, and other current singers on AM
<nickstr> PRICELESS!
<drfsupercenter> 03Nice
<drfsupercenter> 03but it wouldn't sound as good as FM
<nickstr> not to mention AM stereo too
<nickstr> oh it comes close
<nickstr> believe me
<drfsupercenter> 03what about HD Radio?
<drfsupercenter> 03with FM?
<junh1024-XD> !define vice
<[TST]Bot> -!- frailty: moral weakness
<peer> yeah, sorry
<junh1024-XD> !define lust
<[TST]Bot> -!- lecherousness: a strong sexual desire
<nickstr> no
<nickstr> HD Radio is proprietary
<nickstr> plus its AM version SUCKS
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I'm saying
<nickstr> after 30 miles its no good
<drfsupercenter> 03HD Radio for FM is good
<nickstr> and even in the station's CITY OF LICENSE its hit and miss
<nickstr> I tried for this type of thing in Portland Oregon and Denver Colorado
<nickstr> the only stations I got reliable locks on were 50KW
<nickstr> in Portland it was KEX 1190
<nickstr> in Denver it was KOA 850
<Armageddon> xD
<nickstr> FM HD in both cities was perfect

<drfsupercenter> 03the rest are just upscaled stereo
<nickstr> ION in my area is a bit better but the multiplex is still a bit crowded
<drfsupercenter> 03well, it's just that they show a bunch of crappy shows

<nickstr> I am not kidding
<drfsupercenter> 03I generally don't need to worry about that since my cable relays them all to me

<nickstr> why they packed that many streams into one 6 MHz channel is beyond me
<drfsupercenter> 03to be cheap

<Umbreon> 12who is this josh D:
<Umbreon> 12it should be Drake and Armageddon
<Armageddon> xD
<Drake> 04But if NS was my sibling then we couldn't be together!

<Umbreon> 12naturally there will be a couple rewritings here and there
<Drake> 04Oh yes.
<Drake> 04A couple.

<nickstr> I might try to make a bot for IRC like I was going to when my channel was busy but I can't see the need right now
<nickstr> its dead much of the time now
<Umbreon> 12?
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> mIRC bots are easy, haven't tried anything else
<Ascendant> although, you need permission from a mod to have a bot in here
<nickstr> given the channel I had the bot I was trying to play around with was named Togepi
<nickstr> and its ghost was Azuril
<Ascendant> ah
<nickstr> but I was disappointed with the script so I abandoned the project
<nickstr> plus most of my regulars had their lives become fairly busy or drifted away from Pokemon
*Umbreon gives Armageddon mac and cheese
*Armageddon blows the mac up

<Armageddon> awesome music
<Armageddon> ...even if the percussion section of the band that played it sucks.
<Umbreon> 12i still think volbeat sounds funny
<nickstr> sad but true
<nickstr> given that I tend to use mIRC just for Pokemon channels given my quit script I actually have to use web based ones for other networks or channels
<nickstr> Mibbit I have used but I think the green tree frog staring at you as a logo is a bit strange
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> ScriptBot is a mIRC bot
<nickstr> I am not surprised
<nickstr> many seem to be
<Drake> 04
<Umbreon> 12what?
<nickstr> but at least for the Mibbit logo I can look at something else if the frog creeps me out

<Umbreon> 12i hate 2 of the 3 pokemon in that picture
<Umbreon> 12so i don't care XD
<Umbreon> 12also
<Drake> 04The general idea of it is awesome.
<Umbreon> 12when you warn when a picture is SFW that's usually a bad sign XD
<Drake> 04Staying at home playing games with a Pokemon?
<Drake> 04That is cool.
<Drake> 04And lol
<Umbreon> 12that usually means most pictures posted is NSWF
<Drake> 04herpderp
<Umbreon> 12derp is what i thought when playing against ghetsis
<Ascendant> mSL is just easy to script in
<Ascendant> it's rather simple
<Drake> 04Ghetsis was a mean b!tch
<Drake> 04That goddamn Hydreigon
<Umbreon> 12i think he was kind to me
<Umbreon> 12his last pokemon
<nickstr> unfortunately I don't know how to script and can't find any complete tutorials
<Umbreon> 12bisharp could of easily killed my counter

<Umbreon> !define taiyaki
<[TST]Bot> -!- Taiyaki|たい焼き|, literally "baked sea bream" is a Japanese fish-shaped cake. The most common filling is red bean paste that is made from sweetened azuki beans. Other common fillings may be custard, chocolate, or cheese. Some shops even sell taiyaki with okonomiyaki, gyoza filling, or a sausage inside.
<Umbreon> !define teriyaki
<[TST]Bot> -!- beef or chicken or seafood marinated in spicy soy sauce and grilled or broiled
<Altair> hey Viral

<HyperMetalLugia> ;3
<Chimera> yes
<Chimera> but
<Chimera> I don't have it
<AeroDrawcohem> I have no idea :'D
<Chimera> You need to beatthe E4 apparently
<Chimera> so you can go to the rightmost area
<Chimera> >A>
<Chimera> 04:<
<Sneas> 03bbs .-.
<Chimera> k
<Chimera> you know what screw it
<Chimera> I'll just Pokésave my Krookodile
<Chimera> It's a TM anyone could have taught it
<Chimera> SO I TECHNICALLY AM NOT CHEATING
<Chimera> :'D
<Skylands|White> 10:P
*Quanyails 7lols at her Zebstrika.
<Skylands|White> 10Scolipede is so badass looking
<Chimera> yes
<Chimera> :O
<Chimera> I love some of these new guys
*Skylands|White haz Venipede at the moment
<Chimera> as much as others hate them all
<Sneas> 03[11:24] <Chimera> SO I TECHNICALLY AM NOT CHEATING
<Sneas> 03That's exactly what I say when I use Pokesav to EV train :3

<Chimera> Sneas
<Chimera> that's a lie
<Chimera> You can make them have as much EVs as you want
<Chimera> so that's illegitamate
<Chimera> Now, teaching it a TM move it CAN learn is another story
<Chimera> And justified if getting said TM is a pita
<Skylands|White> 10lulz

<SilverSonic> drf, why else was i trying to get the darn script working on my channel xD
<drfsupercenter> 03continuation.
<SilverSonic> so we could spam it there
<Kosovo> !define Umbreon
<[TST]Bot> -!- is the second of the two Generation II Eeveelutions, a Dark-type Pokémon. Somewhat uniquely, it was the only pure Dark-type in the generation it was introduced in, and also uniquely, is the only Eeveelution better suited to defending rather than attacking. ...
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what's pro though
<drfsupercenter> 03teach an Eevee Baton Pass
<drfsupercenter> 03then evolve it into Umbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03and have it learn Mean Look
<drfsupercenter> 03you have yourself a Pokémon catching machine
<Umbreon> 12drf
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<Umbreon> 12that strategy is older than you are
<Ripred> !define Ripred
<[TST]Bot> -!- No results found
<drfsupercenter> 03well good for it
<Ripred> D:
<Umbreon> 12XD
<Ripred> 4whats baton pass do
<Ripred> 4?
*Umbreon mean looks drf
<drfsupercenter> 03switches your Pokémon
<drfsupercenter> 03but the effects stay
<Umbreon> 12switches your pokemon
<drfsupercenter> 03so the Mean Look will still be in effect
<Umbreon> 12but the effects stay
<Armageddon> wb Skylands
<drfsupercenter> 03stop copying me
<Umbreon> 12basically it allows you to switch pokemon
<Ripred> 4mean look makes it so it cant flee right?
<Skylands> 10Ty
<drfsupercenter> 03right
<Umbreon> 12and the pokemon you switch with gets all the stat gains, stat decreases
<Umbreon> 12and most other effects
<Umbreon> 12that the pokemon that used baton pass had
<Ripred> 4I dont see how that i super helpfull
<Umbreon> 12in competitive
<Umbreon> 12very
<drfsupercenter> 03Ripred
<Ripred> 4but thats proboly because i dont understand the finer points of pokemon catching
<Ripred> 4?
<drfsupercenter> 03because if you use Mean Look and switch Pokémon
<Umbreon> 12you mean look a pokemon
<drfsupercenter> 03the Mean Look goes away
<Umbreon> 12then baton pass into a counter
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you need Baton Pass
<Ripred> 4ohh
<Ripred> 4i see
<Ripred> 4i should evolve one of my eevees to an umbreon
<Umbreon> 12outside of battling
<Umbreon> 12i don't see the appeal though
<Umbreon> 12usually AIs don't switch pokemon
<nickstr> I found ANOTHER Black and White repellant
<Ripred> 4great...
<nickstr> the only way I can get Togepi is in the White forest
<Umbreon> 12and there is only a hand full of pokemon that run away from you
<Ripred> 4and?
<nickstr> which is time restricted
<Umbreon> 12most of them outspeed umbreon anyway
<Ripred> 4nickstr
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr, you could always fiddle with the clock if you really want
<nickstr> you can't
<Ripred> 4just fiddle with the date alot untill it clears white forest
<Ascendant> o
<Ripred> 4then problem solved
<drfsupercenter> 03no not that
<nickstr> not really
<drfsupercenter> 03just keep setting the date back
<nickstr> because the GRASS disappears too
<Ripred> 4yes
<Ascendant> ;o
<Ascendant> hi Feather
<drfsupercenter> 03or
<Ripred> 4if you fiddle with the date too much it clears white forest 100%
<NightSeas> 12Hi Ascendant
<drfsupercenter> 03what you could do
<drfsupercenter> 03I can trade you a Togepi from HeartGold
<drfsupercenter> 03and then breed it in White
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Ripred> 4the only way to get it back is via entralink
<Ascendant> hi
<nickstr> but there in lies a problem
<Ripred> 4WAIT
<nickstr> YOU HAVE TO KNOW PEOPLE WHO PLAY BLACK AND WHITE IN REAL LIFE
<Ripred> 4i have a good idea
<Ripred> 4really good one actualy
<Ripred> 4WHY DONT YOU STOP PLAYING BLACK/WHIT?
<Ripred> 4xD
<Ripred> 4+e
<drfsupercenter> 03he doesn't even own it
<Ripred> 4then stop complaining?
<Ripred> 4you dont have it
<drfsupercenter> 03why don't you
<Ripred> 4it doesnt effect you
<nickstr> everyone I know does not play Pokemon games anymore or never even started
<nickstr> that does not make it less of a turd
<Ripred> 4but it doesnt effect you seeing as you dont even ahev the game
<Ripred> 4have*
<nickstr> Black and White are turds whether you own them or not
<Armageddon> wb Sneas :3
<Ripred> 4ignore black/white and get the hoen remakes
<Ripred> 4then poof
<nickstr> EWW HOENN
<Ripred> 4wow
<Ascendant> hoenn was actually decent
<NightSeas> 12Haters ganna hate XD
<nickstr> I hated Hoenn
<Ripred> 4i agree
<Ascendant> unlike sinnoh and isshu
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13Hoenn = best region
<Angel_Espeon> 13IMO
<drfsupercenter> 03RSE were my favorite
<nickstr> Ruby I could not play through
<Ripred> 4isshu?
<nickstr> I quit before the first gym
<Ascendant> RSE were awesome
<Ripred> 4derp
<Ripred> 4nickstr
<nickstr> luckily this was a ROM in an emulator so no loss
<Ripred> 4why not say EWWWW EVERYTHING - 1st gen
<Ripred> 4then go play fire red and leaf green
<NightSeas> 12nickstr don't like stuff even drf likes, lol
<Ripred> 4and live in your own happy bubble
<Ripred> 4xd
<Ripred> 4X
<nickstr> I like Johto and Shinoh though
<Ripred> 4fingers are spazzing >_<
<nickstr> Isshu and Hoenn are about the only ones I hate
<Ripred> 4what about kanto?
<nickstr> Kanto I like
<Armageddon> wb Fluorine and Lord-Harlot
<Angel_Espeon> 13The only region I didn't like was Sinnoh
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, I didn't hate it
<Angel_Espeon> 13But I found it the least enjoyable
<Kosovo> ^
<Ripred> 4i dont hate any of them
<Kosovo> sinnoh was meh imo
<nickstr> I hate Isshu because the games suck
<Ripred> 4but i like 1st and 2nd best
<Kosovo> hoenn is the best imo
<jasperdett|laptop> cool
<Prince-dari> Blarg.
<Ripred> 4why do we call it isshu?
<Kosovo> none of them are bad
<nickstr> Hoenn because they were trying far to hard to be different
<Ripred> 4^kosovo
<Ripred> 4agreed
<Ascendant> they weren't trying too hard
<Ascendant> isshu and sinnoh are what you call trying too hard
<jasperdett|laptop> then i can have JasperBot up 24/7 again
<Skylands> 10DANJO
<Ripred> 4isshu tried really hard
<Ripred> 4but i like most of its efforts
<Kosovo> here's how I honestly see it:
<Armageddon> :O
<Armageddon> !peak
<EpicStatsGuy> Current channel peak for #True-Flame is 71, set 5wks 6days 2hrs 3mins 4secs ago.
<Nightshadow|VNC> Peak for #True-Flame is 48 set on 17/03/2011

<Skylands> 10!stats
<EpicStatsGuy> Stats updating at http://www.ho-ohrealm.net/chat/chatstats...
<Kosovo> all of them are good in their own ways
<Kosovo> none of them are /bad/
<Kosovo> but that's just me
<nickstr> your opinion
<nickstr> and yes it is just you
<Kosovo> I know
<Kosovo> and it's yours as well
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol that's pretty much the same as how I see it xD
<Ascendant> isshu<sinnoh<johto/hoenn/kanto
<NightSeas> 12I don't dislike any of them :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not too sure about Isshu because I haven't played enough of it yet
<Ascendant> and lol

<drfsupercenter> 03is that funny or what
<drfsupercenter> 03pardon the quality
<drfsupercenter> 03this was years ago
<Skylands> 10Now to point out mispronunciations in the original
<Angel_Espeon> 13The PBR announcer is such a fail at pronunciation
<Angel_Espeon> 13e.g. Arcanine
<drfsupercenter> 03PBR fails in all regards
<Angel_Espeon> 13even in the anime they pronounce it arca-nine
<Angel_Espeon> 13he pronounces it are-canine
<Angel_Espeon> 13:|
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I've already proven that the people who dub the show can't even say their own names right LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03the example, Bonsly
<Angel_Espeon> 13One of the many reasons I disabled the announcer's commentary |D
<drfsupercenter> 03the 8th movie was a 4KIDS dub
<SilverSonic> xD
<drfsupercenter> 03and they said it like "bons-lee"
<drfsupercenter> 03then in Battle Fronteir which was Pokémon USA
<SilverSonic> !ew 4Kids
<drfsupercenter> 13EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 4KIDS
<drfsupercenter> 03they said it like "Bons-lie"
<Skylands> 10I remember that @ drf
<drfsupercenter> 03so that pretty much proves that they don't even know what they're doing
<Skylands> 10They were aired around the same time too
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh yeah LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well "aired", the movie was a DVD
<drfsupercenter> 03but regardless
<Angel_Espeon> 13I stopped watching when they changed the voices :|
<drfsupercenter> 03same
<drfsupercenter> 03EW THE NEW DUB
<drfsupercenter> 034KIDS may have butchered it, but IMO it's just not Pokémon without them
<drfsupercenter> 03but still, it'/s proof that 4KIDS can't say the names right XD
<drfsupercenter> 03Rayquaza was another one
<drfsupercenter> 03I say it like "ray-quah-zah"
<drfsupercenter> 03they said it like "ray-quay-za"
<Skylands> 10Used to say with 'quah' too
<Skylands> 10but I prefer 'quay'
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't
<drfsupercenter> 03it just sounds wrong with quay
<Skylands> 10Found one
<Skylands> 10Growlithe
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Skylands> 10They said Growl-liiithe
<Skylands> 10not Growl-ithe
*Ripred 4is finally back
<Skylands> 10But regardless
<drfsupercenter> 03there were also some video glitches LOL
<Skylands> 10Original Pokerap is awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03look at when they say Graveler
<drfsupercenter> 03it's actually a Geodude
<Skylands> 10Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Cartoon Network fixed it, oddly enough
<Skylands> 10That's what happens when you have to say 150 names in 3 minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah they said Charmander weird
<drfsupercenter> 03putting emphasis on the "char"
<drfsupercenter> 03but so far the names all sound fine
<drfsupercenter> 03and see, I'm, sure they spent more than 3 minutes making the video LOL
<Skylands> 10Obviously XD
<drfsupercenter> 03Pidgeotto was said odd but that's just to fit it in
<drfsupercenter> 03ah yeah I see what you mean about Growlithe
<drfsupercenter> 03I've actually never noticed that before LOL

<SilverSonic> well, now my ears are being raped by another video o3o
<Skylands> 10Adventures on the Orange Islands in one boxset?
<Skylands> 10I'm just trying to get an idea because I might buy these in the future
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Bo
<HyperMetalLugia> Booo
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03most of the Pokémon stuff is OOP
<drfsupercenter> 03which is a shame
<Ray> 02np :D
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm a collector so I have it all XD
<Skylands> 10then what comes next?
<drfsupercenter> 03Johto Journeys, the rarest of them all
<Skylands> 10Master Quest for $99
<Skylands> 10Fun.

<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Sparky|HW> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I SAID they're rare
<drfsupercenter> 03but they're all single layer
<drfsupercenter> 03so I can make 1:1 copies
<drfsupercenter> 03for people who don't care about shiny packaging
<nickstr> because Viz is ignorant and idiotic
<SilverSonic> <peer> trollface.jpg <- why do you say that? xD
<Sparky|HW> 'kay, bye~
<nickstr> plus Black and White focused
<Ripred> 4SHINY PACKAGING

<drfsupercenter> 03crap, where'd my Panda Express receipt go
<drfsupercenter> 03I want to get my free entree :/

<drfsupercenter> 03*it
<nickstr> I started a petition for Viz to release Johto Journeys, Johto League Champions, and reissue Master Quest on DVD box sets
<SilverSonic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=724LSjxOyOw&feature=related LMFAO
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL

<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I now have legit seasons 1-6 complete, and then bootlegs of 7
<nickstr> I gave up and imported
<drfsupercenter> 03and will soon have bootlegs of 8
<drfsupercenter> 03then 9-12 legit
<drfsupercenter> 03yes I know it's DP but I'm collecting
<drfsupercenter> 03Pokémon Advanced boxsets are still being sold, but only at Amazon.ca
<drfsupercenter> 03normal Amazon doesn't have them LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why, but eh
<Skylands> 10Johto League Champions, does that have a boxset?
<nickstr> in Australia yes
<nickstr> and New Zealand
<nickstr> because Magna Pacific wins like taht
<nickstr> *that
<Ray> 02my earsssss
<Ray> 02OOWWWW
<Ray> 02;__;
<Soyuz> ohai Ray
<drfsupercenter> 03so as far as American releases go, no
<Skylands> 10k
<Ray> 02Ohai Soyuz
<drfsupercenter> 03there's 7 total
*Skylands writes this down
<drfsupercenter> 03which I finally have
<nickstr> Viz adamantly refuses to release Johto box sets
<drfsupercenter> 03I just got the last two discs I was missing yesterday XD
<Soyuz> Who are you
<drfsupercenter> 03so I now own all 7
<Skylands> 10Hm
<drfsupercenter> 03heck, I bought the 7th one back when it wasn't OOP
<Skylands> 10my library has some JLC DVDs
<drfsupercenter> 03as did mine
<drfsupercenter> 03yay DVD Decrypter?
<Skylands> 10just of a few eps though
<Ray> 02Fine here :3
<drfsupercenter> 03Skylands I can send you DVD+R copies of like, the whole series LOL
<Ray> 02just with a cold but bleh...
<Ray> 02anyways, you?
<drfsupercenter> 03or at least the out of print ones
<Skylands> 10Well
<Skylands> 10I prefer the original
<Skylands> 10Not copies
<drfsupercenter> 03same
<Novi> Fear its RAY
<drfsupercenter> 03but it ends up being really pricey
<Skylands> 10but if I ever become desperate, sure
<Skylands> 10Meh
<drfsupercenter> 03heck, with Johto Journeys I would have taken copies
<drfsupercenter> 03but I couldn't even find those
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
*Novi never sees Sammy no more ;-;
<drfsupercenter> 03that's how rare they are
<nickstr> because of your "NTSC or GFTO" bias
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr not all of us have region free DVD players
<drfsupercenter> 03and even so most TVs won't do PAL
<nickstr> the PAL discs are far more common and cheaper
<nickstr> you do if you have VideoLAN
<drfsupercenter> 03they're also PAL telecined
<drfsupercenter> 03if I'm going to use a computer
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll just stick to the VOB files
<nickstr> plus DVD players convert between TV systems
<drfsupercenter> 03no they don't
<drfsupercenter> 03my DVD player exports whatever the DVD has
<Ray> 02.-.
<drfsupercenter> 03I've had region free PAL discs
<drfsupercenter> 03and it exported it in PAL>
<SkylerTheDraogn> >>
<SkylerTheDraogn> *pokes*
<nickstr> then your DVD player sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03gonna go to dinner
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai
<nickstr> then again so does the expensive one bought brand new in 2001 here
<Prince-dari> Lol.
*Betowolf holds up a DSi XL over his head. DA NA NA NAAAHHH!!!! :D
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> I <3 Dsi XL
<Novi> wonder were she is anyway o.o
*Soyuz pokes Ray
<Ray> 02hm?
<Soyuz> I need you to review something
<Ray> 02what is it? o3o
<Soyuz> http://pastebin.com/mdLPirc3 o3o
<Soyuz> It is that
<Anakin> ohai Ray
<peer> trollface.jpg
<nickstr> why
<nickstr> its just a DSi with a bigger screen slapped on it
<nickstr> and nothing else
<HyperMetalLugia> That's why I love it
<HyperMetalLugia> I never got a Dsi
<Ray> 02ohai NS
*HyperMetalLugia was stuck with a breaking DS lite for over 3 years
<Soyuz> But yeah, its a fanfiction of mine Ray
<nickstr> I never got a DSi because I did not see the need for it
<nickstr> I already had a PSP and that pretty much beats the DSi in multimedia
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew PSP
<nickstr> plus I have a DS for Nintendo games
*Ripred 4poofs
<HyperMetalLugia> Baai
<Anakin> Soyuz lol
<nickstr> the DSi sucks in multimedia compared to the PSP
<Ripred> 4baai
<HyperMetalLugia> That's why I have a laptop
<Anakin> you really need to stop telling everyone to read your fanfics
<HyperMetalLugia> Way better than both
<Anakin> even I don't do that
<nickstr> because Nintendo does not really make good hardware
<Ripred> 4PSP portable for the win!
<HyperMetalLugia> Lies
<Ray> 02way to kill my lazy-ness ¬¬
<Ray> 02XD
<HyperMetalLugia> And that is obvious
<Ripred> 4just wait for the 3DS
<nickstr> Nintendo does not innovate
<nickstr> they just follow
<Nova> GAH
*Nova Sets Claymore randomly in the room~
<SkylerTheDraogn> o.o
<Ripred> 4yay minecraft is up
<SkylerTheDraogn> some one lives
<Ripred> 4bye
<HyperMetalLugia> ew
<Prince-dari> Nintendo doesn't innovate?
<Prince-dari> Lol.
<SkylerTheDraogn> >3> and even lol'ed
<Soyuz> Anakin; when I have writers block, I feel the 'right' to do :P
<HyperMetalLugia> So nintendo followed for the Wii *cough*
<nickstr> they don't
<Prince-dari> They're always ahead of Sony and Microsoft?
<nickstr> Nintendo is just a follower
<Soyuz> besides, I ask you (what) twice if I care?
<Anakin> and it gets annoying
<nickstr> and what you think are "innovations" are just gimmicks so Nintendo can sell hardware without improving the system's other capabilities
<Prince-dari> Nintendo bring out their motion controlled console years before Sony got their "Playstation Move" out, which is pretty much just a copy.
<Soyuz> to you, thats obvious
<nickstr> and yet it was outclassed in so many things
<SkylerTheDraogn> *pokes* ??
<Prince-dari> And whether it really is good or not nearly everyone bought one.
<nickstr> the Playstation 3 is FAR more powerful than the Wii
<Prince-dari> It was cheap, Nintendo has the good sense to own the patents to all of their components so their console would be cheap, Microsoft and Sony copied them after they did it.
<Prince-dari> Hey.
<Prince-dari> Power isn't everything anyway.
<nickstr> I am isolating hardware from games here
<Prince-dari> I don't see the PS3 as innovative in any way, it's just a more powerful PS3.
<nickstr> it really is
<Prince-dari> A more powerful PS2, sorry.
<nickstr> the Playstation 3 was the first console to use Blu Ray discs for storing games along with one of only two capable of HD
<nickstr> only the Playstation 3 and xBOX 360 can do HD video
<nickstr> they both work at up to 1080p
<Prince-dari> So?
<Ray> 02*sigh* I'm just way to lazy to read all this xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Big whoop
<nickstr> the Wii can only do 480i at the most
<Prince-dari> I still don't really see your point.
<nickstr> plus its years behind in processing power
<jasperdett|laptop> k
<nickstr> the Wii is a joke compared to the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360
<Prince-dari> Which is why the wii tops in sales?
<HyperMetalLugia> Seems like it
<Prince-dari> By a massive margin?

<Panty> sty
<Anakin> ...or not.
<Anakin> xD
<Anakin> wb Damos
<nickstr> you are acting like Nintendo is god and everyone else is the devil
<Prince-dari> Sony is the devil.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup :3
<HyperMetalLugia> After they screwed the playstation series with the PS3
<Prince-dari> I don't even really notice the difference between my PS3 in HD on a 32" screen and my wii on a 20" screen without HD.
<Prince-dari> It's not that important.
<SilverSonic> im not lazy to read it, i just suck at feedback XD
<Soyuz> Ray; well its 61 pages
<nickstr> I notice the difference
<Soyuz> so I can see why laziness would triumph
<SilverSonic> indeed
<nickstr> the picture on the Playstation 3 looks sharper and more detailed
<Damos> 13thankiezs
<nickstr> the Wii looks fuzzy and pixelated in comparison
<Prince-dari> Makes no difference to me.
<HyperMetalLugia> I also upconvert my Wii so yay me
<nickstr> either your vision is bad or you need your eyes examinated
<HyperMetalLugia> I already have glasses :3
<nickstr> then you need to get your eyes checked again
<Prince-dari> I have 20-20 vision, but when playing a game a tiny ammount of blur difference does not affect my experience of the game at all.
<nickstr> its more than "a tiny amount"
<nickstr> its a big difference
<Prince-dari> That's subjective.
<nickstr> I have seen the two side by side before
<nickstr> the Wii can't come close
<Sparky|HW> …
<Sparky|HW> WHOA
<Sparky|HW> that was WAY faster than usual
<HyperMetalLugia> Glasses are way more expensive than any console, so I'll pass
<Sparky|HW> usually when I read scary things I get depressed for two or three days
<Sparky|HW> and I just got fixed with one picture
<Sparky|HW> … I love this person :"D
<Ray> 02ok nickstr. Who the hell plays a game/or uses a console by it's graphics?
<Prince-dari> The wii have 84 million sales worldwide compared to only 50 million and 48 million Xbox, and PS3 sales.
<Prince-dari> has*
<nickstr> you are just a bunch of Nintendo fanboys/fangirls
<nickstr> so I sort of expected this
<Ray> 02nope.avi
<Prince-dari> I don't really like any of the companies that much.
<nickstr> yes you are
<Ray> 02I still would like a PS3 before the wii just by the fact of more games for online
<Ray> 02not for the graphics ¬¬
<Prince-dari> I use the PS3 over the wii just for the controller.
<nickstr> I stuck with my PSP rather than getting a DSi because unlike the DS it keeps me entertained even when I don't feel like playing video games
<Ray> 02xD
<Cass> Hello ppl
<Prince-dari> Black Ops is the best selling PS3 game? Meh I prefered MW2.
<Ray> 02^
<Anakin> ohai Iskierka and Cass
<Ray> 02how ever, I haven't play'd either both games at fully
<Prince-dari> While I like some of the MW2 hacks like QS lobbies there are too many idiots who just god mode now. >_>
<Ray> 02so my opinion doesn't count :3
<nickstr> plus many hard core games go with Sony or Microsoft over Nintendo
<nickstr> *gamers
<Prince-dari> Nintendo isn't a hardcore gamer consoler obviously.
<Prince-dari> It's a family console.
<Prince-dari> A more social one.
<SkylerTheDraogn> wow trippy
<Jason> jasperdett|laptop: you there?
<nickstr> the Wii is just gimmicks on top of gimmicks
<SkylerTheDraogn> i'm back
<Jason> say my name when you come back
<Ray> 02lol PS3 reference
<SkylerTheDraogn> >>
<Prince-dari> In your opinion, which I think is completely wrong.
<SkylerTheDraogn> where u gone
<SkylerTheDraogn> :P
<peer> nickstr, you can't say the gimmicks don't work
<Ray> 02"the wiimote is a givemenick" time later here goes the PSMove
<nickstr> the only reason why those gimmicks have worked was Nintendo's marketing
<Prince-dari> PSMove is the crappiest thing I've ever seen.
<peer> microsoft and sony are both trying to get into the wii's target audience more than before
<peer> which is everyone
<Ray> 02Agree with you @dari
<nickstr> I hated Nintendo as a hardware maker for the longest time because they just did not innovate especially in portable systems
<nickstr> I got started with Sega and the Game Gear which unlike the Gameboy was in fact a color system that did not require any sort of weird lighting
<Prince-dari> I agree that portable systems just seem to be remakes of the same thing.
<nickstr> plus the game library was impressive
<peer> Nintendo is more of "go with what works"
<Ray> 02true
<nickstr> they waited until 1998 to put out a color portable game system
<nickstr> and even THEN it sucked compared to the Game Gear
<peer> they waited until 2001 to adopt CDs
<Ray> 02PS and XBOX otherwise the really DON'T Change...
<Ray> 02they are just remakes of the first thing...
<peer> xbox introduced a reliable internet-based gaming network
<peer> which is why a lot of people get it
<Ray> 02but the console was STILL the same
<SkylerTheDraogn> i'ma go poof
<SkylerTheDraogn> things to be doing
<SkylerTheDraogn> :/
<SkylerTheDraogn> ttfn
<Ray> 02I can't see any diference between the XBOX and the XBOX360 (aside from graphics/online/gamelist)
<peer> true, the xbox 360 isn't much of a departure from the original, but they didn't really need to change much, just kind of update the hardware
<peer> Nintendo only changed because what they were trying didn't work
<Ray> 02yeah, that's the fun thing about "Inovation"
<Armageddon> heya SLM and Matt
<SLM> sup Armageddon
<peer> which is why the xbox was a success
<Cass> where is that umm
<peer> which is why the PS1 was a success
<Cass> growlithe person
<Armageddon> Shiny-Growlithe?
<peer> which is why the Wii was a success
<Soyuz> he left

<Sparky|HW> okay
<jasperdett|laptop> yes?
<Aeroslash> nighta ll
<Jason> you figure it out?
<Aeroslash> *all
<Sparky|HW> circumstance one: at least three reverse-residents have been moved due to an invitation from a separate ROM High-Link
<jasperdett|laptop> umm no i got installed i can not figure it out from there
<eXAKR> two?
<Jason> brb
<DarthSidious> o_o
<Chimera> 04bbl
<Sparky|HW> they've also invited to the reverse world because their "charisma" (something like that) has been reduced
<jasperdett|laptop> same here
<Damos> 13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKVBkctp6ac&feature=related
<Damos> 13this song is just so beautiful
<Sparky|HW> circumstance two (well, more like extension): it's possible for a separate ROM highlink to invite/pull the characters before you get to the town
*DarthVader steals DarthSidious's LightSaber :3
*DarthVader flees
<Jason> back
<Sparky|HW> "Even before you get there, the residents' charisma lowers day by day, so they switch between reverse and normal. The first resident should become reverse-ten people by the end of the second week"

<Damos> 13this song is just so beautiful
<eXAKR> and then, Sparky|HW?
<Sparky|HW> It can also be a good thing; apparently you can pull whatever residents you like into the area to your liking
*Umbreon tickles eXAKR
*Kosovo throws Umbreon into the tickle machine
<Sparky|HW> If you don't care about dated events, set the time to 23:59->(battle or talk to the person you'd like to stay)-> If you save repeatedly after 0:01, then only the person you'd like to stay stays in normal and everyone else moves to reverse. After that, just invite them with a different version
*Umbreon gasps
*Kosovo chuckles
<Kosovo> your gasps amuse me
<HyperMetalLugia> GASPOSOS
<eXAKR> and...?
<Sparky|HW> For people who think "I don't want to send them into reverse, but battling them everyday is a hassle," it's okay if you leave ten people in reverse then you can invite them to a separate version, or leave them be as long as you don't futz with the time. When you cross paths with them, just make sure they're in a place where highlinks can't reach like south of Raimon (who?)

<nickstr> I have changed in the way that I am not arguing with encoders anymore
<nickstr> in fact I have learned a fair bit
<junh1024-XD> caaaaaaaaaaa
<junh1024-XD> what
<junh1024-XD> oh?
<peer> is that apoc's server fU:
<Multi> no

<peer> ok

<Multi> sx
<peer> ky?
<Multi> a person from another server
<Multi> ;o
<nickstr> yes
<peer> name sounds vaguely familiar
<junh1024-XD> (1:53:56 PM) mode (+m )
<nickstr> that was when it started
<peer> i would do something but i can't fU:
<junh1024-XD> ok
<junh1024-XD> what did you learn [about encoding]?
<peer> trollface.jpg
<nickstr> among other things how to deal with AVC encoded video files
<nickstr> indexing them for AVI Synth
<junh1024-XD> oh, yup
<junh1024-XD> \
<junh1024-XD> \
<junh1024-XD> did you have anything else you wanned to say/ask me?
<nickstr> but I still have a concern about changing the framerate
<peer> fucking ladybugs
<peer> one just bit me
<junh1024-XD> selecteven().tdecimate()
<nickstr> if I use ChangeFPS or something similar will that throw off the A/V sync?
<junh1024-XD> no for both, i think. i suggest my line, which brings it down to 24, analyzing for motion.
<nickstr> ok
<nickstr> I will give that one a try then
<junh1024-XD> ChangeFPS brings it to any FPS, but doesn't analyze for motion, so it may look jerky.
<nickstr> I already indexed the AVC transport stream and brought it into AvSPMod along with doing color balancing and changing the brightness/saturation/contrast
<junh1024-XD> M2 or m3?
<nickstr> 3
<nickstr> I have Uso's encode of Pokemon The Movie 2000
<junh1024-XD> I used tweak(sat=1.2,cont=1.12) #colours
<junh1024-XD> coloryuv(gain_v=-5,gain_u=+10)
<nickstr> his apparently is already 5.1 surround
<junh1024-XD> but i might change my mind, whats yours?
<nickstr> I will have to find it
<nickstr> after I switch on the 1 TB external
<junh1024-XD> I may make some music edits, so i'm keeping it 2.0 for simplicity's sake. also, the 5.1 surround may not be genuine
<junh1024-XD> (same for m2)
<nickstr> I will find out
<nickstr> actually I did
<nickstr> it looks legit
<junh1024-XD> most people don't have surround systems, also
<nickstr> Converttoyv12()
<nickstr> ColorYUV(gain_u=3, gain_v=-2)
<nickstr> Tweak(bright=-2, sat=1.5, cont=1.1)
<nickstr> that is what I have
<junh1024-XD> hmm, the saturation is a bit high on yours
<nickstr> I will crank it down a little
<junh1024-XD> you may not need Converttoyv12()
<nickstr> I just put it in there for safety but will remove it if I find out that its not needed
<junh1024-XD> unnecessary colourspace conversions may reduce quality
<nickstr> and its not needed
<nickstr> good thing we caught this now rather than later
<nickstr> plus it will increase the rendering fps as well I believe
<junh1024-XD> only by like, 1%, minor
<nickstr> still an improvement as far as I am concerned
<nickstr> if only there was a native 64 bit version
<junh1024-XD> there is avisynth64, i think. but there are like, baisiclly no native 64bit filters,
<junh1024-XD> except for the internal wans, so its baisically useless
<nickstr> thats alot better
<nickstr> your white point looks better than mine
<junh1024-XD> and don't expect any speed increases, either
<junh1024-XD> oh, really?
<nickstr> yes
<junh1024-XD> my M2 coefficients might look crap
<nickstr> the two seem to have similar tints
<junh1024-XD> tweak(sat=1.12,cont=1.02) #colours m2coef
<junh1024-XD> coloryuv(gain_v=+0,gain_u=-8) #m2coef may look crap
<nickstr> I am happy with the one given before
<nickstr> that looks so much better
<junh1024-XD> you have m2 ts on you?
<nickstr> yes

<junh1024-XD> so i thought it sounded good
<nickstr> no AAC+ then
<junh1024-XD> nah
<drfsupercenter> 03the original one, the two Advanced Battle Articuno episodes had Kids' WB watermarks
<drfsupercenter> 03now that they're on DVD
<drfsupercenter> 03I could easily just redo that
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm considering it XD
<junh1024-XD> what song, drf?
<nickstr> I would have used AAC+ for 96k
<drfsupercenter> 03Everytime We Touch
<junh1024-XD> do not liek.
<nickstr> Cascada
<drfsupercenter> 03:<
<drfsupercenter> 03That AMV is awesome though
<drfsupercenter> 03it's what brought like half of TST's members here
<drfsupercenter> 03since they saw it on YouTube
<drfsupercenter> 03:>
<nickstr> I remember seeing Pokeshipping AMVs made relating to that song
<drfsupercenter> 03it is Pokeshipping
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno + Lugia
<drfsupercenter> 03it's kinda meaningless now though
<nickstr> WRONG
<drfsupercenter> 03since they aren't together anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno is TST's admin
<nickstr> Pokeshipping is Ash and Misty
<junh1024-XD> I would use LCAAC but with the Mainconcept encoder, since i find when players switch between the LC and HE stream, it sounds annoying.
<drfsupercenter> 03Lugia used to be the other admin
<drfsupercenter> 03the two of them were dating LOL
<junh1024-XD> or 112 or 128.
<drfsupercenter> 03but they broke up
<drfsupercenter> 03so NOW it's meaningless
<drfsupercenter> 03but I still want the video for vintage purposes.
*Light_Latias tickles Umbreon lately

<John_Galt> hello
<nickstr> those start after A Real Cleffa Hanger from what I saw in episode listing
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunnio
<drfsupercenter> 03-i
<drfsupercenter> 03but I should be getting the DVD tomorrow
<drfsupercenter> 03and then I can rip VOBs
<drfsupercenter> 03at the time I made the AMV (back in 2006), it was a TV rip only
<drfsupercenter> 03so I had to settle for a HDTV sourced Kids' WB rip which was better quality than the Japanese one, believe it or not
<Armageddon> I love how the botnet hits
<Armageddon> 1 minute after I have to leave -.-
<nickstr> four or five years ago
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03that's how old the video is

<junh1024-XD> the AB JAP raws may had chroma leaking issues.

<Armageddon> fucking gay fuck
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Armageddon> also we need a faster dnsbl
<drfsupercenter> 03these were from um
<drfsupercenter> 03that one dude in #PM
<drfsupercenter> 03who had a way to cap HDTV back in 2006 LOL
<junh1024-XD> thats not HDTV, thats analogue, then
<drfsupercenter> 03no, it's HDTV
<nickstr> one of the few HDTV capture cards I know of from back then was made by Hauppage
<drfsupercenter> 03it was WB HD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it wasn't 720p
<drfsupercenter> 03he downscaled them
<junh1024-XD> no, i'm ta;lomg about the japanese cap
<drfsupercenter> 03but the watermark actually said WB HD
<drfsupercenter> 03oh.,
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I'm saying
<drfsupercenter> 03the WB ones were HDTV

<[TST]Bot> -!- A "smart alec" or "smart aleck" is a person regarded as obnoxiously self-assertive and impudent. The term "smart arse" is more commonly used in the United Kingdom, and smart ass is also used in the United States and carries a similar meaning to smart alec, but is less subtle and more vulgar.

<nickstr> its stupid
*SilverSonic agrees with RP4L
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay, time to go

<Roleplay4life> 5They just left /this/ chat, if I understand.
<NightSeas> 12Yes

<nickstr> plus they are isolating themselves
<NightSeas> 12It’s private though
<Nick> Chatkill time!
<Nick> Hdtytifkpgudrdwjdha
<nickstr> hence why I said isolating themselves
<NightSeas> 12They are

<Roleplay4life> 5Gullking kinda got on my nerves lol...
<junh1024-XD> Arti & aurora couldn't acknowledge that TST chat changes over time, and have no understanding that being a server owner or IRCop doesn't mean what they think it means.
<Anthony> I also underestimated WoW's addictingness
<Anthony> I thought it was gonna be bad but then I got absorbed
<Anthony> and what did Gullking do to you?
<nickstr> <junh1024-XD> Arti & aurora couldn't acknowledge that TST chat changes over time, and have no understanding that being a server owner or IRCop doesn't mean what they think it means. <--bingo

<Jason> Aristeo: i
<SilverSonic> she has a dA
<Jason> you wanna read my letter to rogers?
<Jason> Onward to the "issue" If you think that the signals are excellent to my modem, then i dont see why you would possibly be testing it, furthermore, if I have full wifi signal, does that mean i would have fast speeds? NO! It really depends on what speed the modem is providing the router. Anyhow, as i see, none of the staff members i have spoken to have actually replied to my comments, all they have done is sent me the same email worded differentl
<Jason> y, adding more data here and there, so how can i be sure that you arent just generating this crap from a computer? Anyhow, i dont believe that the signal is excellent, otherwise i wouldnt have such terrible speeds, and to be quite honest, your "Speed Boost" advertisement is a sham, as well as before, with a lower internet package I have experienced faster speeds. Is this what rogers believes in? Simply filling their customers with "bonuses" th
<Jason> at are not true? Also, i have seen that you dont even offer reverse DNS control. Perhaps you can look into that issue, and from what i see, none if your "technical support representatives" know what they are talking about either, it seems as if they are all just reading from a script.
<Jason> P.S. If you dont look into this issue soon, i will be looking to cancel my service with you, also, if you knew anything, at all, then you would know that PC stands for Personal Computer, and therefore, my Linux computer is a PC, so you should be able to look at my tests from my "PC".
<Jason> sorry for flood
<SilverSonic> plus i have both my exes on msn and skype xD
<nickstr> given I am in Hendrix country, Purple Haze

<Umbreon> 12how does that hurt
<Armageddon> wb
<nickstr> I actually ended up in an argument over the Pokemon anime's year of introduction in Japan
<eXAKR> .-.
<nickstr> is it true that it premiered in April 1997 in Japan and that it did not show up in English until a preview in early 1998?
<Umbreon> 12well...
<Umbreon> 12you have google
<Umbreon> 12figure it out yourself :P
<nickstr> he says he does nto believe any Wiki
<nickstr> or any information that exists on the internet
<nickstr> *not
<eXAKR> ._.
<eXAKR> Let me know this guy
<eXAKR> I will own him when I get home
<eXAKR> anyway bbl
<Umbreon> 12what is he looking for a newspaper?
<nickstr> maybe
<Umbreon> 12not very many people would want to publish a book on the history of a kid's cartoon
<Umbreon> 12i should know when i tried to do a school report on dbz
<Umbreon> 12and wiki wasn't an allowed source
<nickstr> on person did in relation to Pokemon
<Umbreon> 12well
<Umbreon> 12don't worry nickstr
<Umbreon> 12i'm working for your cause
<Umbreon> 12then again
<Umbreon> 12if he/she/they are that resistent to the truth
<Umbreon> 12it's not worth the trouble
<eXAKR> You can use the source Wikipedia cited
<Umbreon> 12[03:00:51] <nickstr> or any information that exists on the internet
<Umbreon> 12wb to wHoRe Armageddon
<Armageddon> ._.
<Umbreon> 12if they aren't going to allow any information from the internet to get involved
<Armageddon> did you just learn that or something?
<Umbreon> 12not much you can really do
<nickstr> yes
<Umbreon> 12nah
<Armageddon> I remember the time when I got offended when Crimson Phantom called it that
<nickstr> the person insists on talking to Veronica Taylor
<Umbreon> 12okay sorry
<Armageddon> noooo
<Armageddon> I mean
<Armageddon> I'm not offended anymore
<Armageddon> I used to get offended by that XD
<Armageddon> it's fine, seriously
<Umbreon> 12it's just that everytime i see HoR ever since i first saw it
<Armageddon> >freedom of speech
<Armageddon> Ah
<Umbreon> 12i thought of that word and kept to myself
<Armageddon> Is that why you don't like us calling it HoR?
<Umbreon> 12that's why i always refer to this place as "that place"
<Umbreon> 12XD
<Umbreon> 12and yes
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Umbreon> 12everytime i see it, my mind goes into the gutter
<Ascendant> wat
<Umbreon> 12Veronica Taylor wouldn't tell the truth anyway
<Umbreon> 12she is probably drunk on her butt because she lost the best casting position of her life
<nickstr> maybe
<nickstr> but she still shows up at NYAF
<Umbreon> 12not to mention they probably worked on the dub long before it was actually released to the public
<nickstr> Rachael Lillis too
<nickstr> if I wanted to meet any of the Pokemon VAs it would have to be her
<Armageddon> XD
<Umbreon> 12according to wiki
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Armageddon> well Umbreon, technically you could call it HR
<drfsupercenter> 03the shame is that Maddie Blaustein was actually the most willing to work with forums and such, and she died
<Umbreon> 12the first episode in the US first went on air september 8th 1998
<nickstr> but there was a pilot before that
<Umbreon> 12but who knows how long they worked on that dub
<Armageddon> I like HoR better but yeah, there's THAT word...
<Armageddon> I mean, if some random faggot decides to call us that
<nickstr> which aired in the spring of 1998
<Armageddon> then it's their problem
<Armageddon> they can get lost and become no-life losers
<Armageddon> nothing wrong with that
<Umbreon> 12ahh true
<eXAKR> the shame is that Maddie Blaustein was actually the most willing to work with forums and such, and she died <- this
<nickstr> Rachael Lillis does work with fanclubs
<Armageddon> if they want to offend someone they can try do it properly WITHOUT the use of silly names
<nickstr> in fact I am a member of one such group
<Umbreon> 12ahh
<Umbreon> 12well i threw the idea at you
<Umbreon> 12because the last 2 people i showed that to thought it was pretty damn funny
<Armageddon> it kinda is funny XD
<Armageddon> even if it's meant to be offensive
<Armageddon> don't get me wrong
<Armageddon> I don't like it that much
<Armageddon> but on some scale it is quite funny
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<Umbreon> 12when you can absorb it as humor
<Umbreon> 12and not an insult
<Umbreon> 12comedy can be insulting at times
<Umbreon> 1290% of the jokes out there is probably your momma jokes
<nickstr> she played Misty, Jessie, Jigglypuff, Pikachu (when Japanese audio was inaccessable), and I think minor characters too
<Umbreon> 12pokemon should of had guest VAs
<Umbreon> 12William Shatner would of made a fun character
<nickstr> oh yes
<nickstr> like he did in Futurama
<Umbreon> 12he acted in Futurama?
<nickstr> doing a spoken word version of The Real Slim Shady
<nickstr> HILARIOUS!
<nickstr> yes
<Umbreon> 12darnit
<Umbreon> 12now that you mention that
<Umbreon> 12it does sound awfully familiar
<Umbreon> 12wasn't that during some sort of convention (in episode)
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> it was the one about Star Trek
<drfsupercenter> 03Jesus RAM is getting cheap

<Umbreon> 12i had no idea that was Jesus's last name
<drfsupercenter> 03that was like a good $100 when I built my PC
<nickstr> I really am getting hooked on another Billy Joel song now
<Umbreon> 12i always thought it was Christ

<Umbreon> 12it's called birthday

<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah

<drfsupercenter> 03just that
<drfsupercenter> 03my age script goes by a time
<drfsupercenter> 02[I am 0319.998705 02years old]
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why it's not 20 yet
<nickstr> on May 5th 1988
<Umbreon> 12who cares about a script
<Umbreon> 12XD
<nickstr> in Wahiawa Hawaii
<nickstr> on the island of Oahu
<drfsupercenter> 03Umbreon I'm just saying
<drfsupercenter> 03I happen to know when I was born
<Umbreon> 12yeah
<Umbreon> 12same
<drfsupercenter> 03I think my mom said it was close to 4pm
<Umbreon> 12or at least the time i was told
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure the EXACT time but LOL
<Umbreon> 12my friend
<nickstr> the funny thing is I was born on the same island as president Obama
<Umbreon> 12said that the doctor forgot to check the time he was born
<Umbreon> 12XDD
<Umbreon> 12so they second guessed
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Umbreon> 12i have my own problem i want checked on by the doctor
<Umbreon> 12one of my nose nostrils spews out blood when i blow my nose from time to time
<Umbreon> 12it doesn't bleed i just blow my nose and there's blood
<drfsupercenter> 03ew
<nickstr> there is a funny story about when I was born but I am not sure if I could tell it
<Umbreon> 12i was worried if it was mixed with the mucus
<Umbreon> 12but figured that if it was
<Umbreon> 12blood would also come out the other nostril
<Umbreon> 12or in the mucus i've been hacking up from the cold
<Umbreon> 12x-x
<Umbreon> 12is that sound logic?
<Light_Latias> ew .-.

<drfsupercenter> 03They could have expanded it vertically
<drfsupercenter> 03rather than that
<drfsupercenter> 03or at least made the music video anamorphic like the main movie...
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway, running the DVD through DVD Decrypter

<Charles> bow before Spyro and worship him as the holder of all things Cheesecake
<Neon> Keep watching.
<HyperMetalLugia> When you said something, he instantly replied ;P
<Lambda> XDDDD
<Spyrorocks> Everyone always says they were not trying to be funny or soemthing along those lines when someone points it out.
<Lambda> I haven't laughed harder in a while

<drfsupercenter> 03when she said that
*Damos goes to sleep real fast

<HyperMetalLugia> Go and get undressed you two .x.
<Neon> He's already butthurt about something.
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<LL-Away> mmm
<LL-Away> LOL
<Spyrorocks> Once she brings a new boyfriend to stay in her apartment i will report her
<RedDragonX> well I don't blame him for being pissed about that
<RedDragonX> I would be
<Charles> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Cybering it seems X.X
<Damos> 13up and down
<Spyrorocks> they are strict about only one person allowed living in there.
<LL-Away> butbutbut
<RedDragonX> but then again I dont' really care
<Damos> 13up and down
*HyperMetalLugia melts
*Damos hides
<LL-Away> he doesnt have a Kinect...
<RedDragonX> speaking of which....who are you people
<Neon> I'd say about 30% of welfare applicants are doing the same thing. Is he pissed about those? No, he has something personal against this girl.
<Damos> 13suuuuuuure
<HyperMetalLugia> He has another webcam ;P
<Stormy> I think Lambda and Neon are from some forum
<drfsupercenter> 03LL
<Charles> make sure you figure out when he will be there, and if it is a scheduled thing, so that you can not tip her off by an ill sloted visit
<Damos> 13bam
<Damos> 13!
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll have my Kinect on Saturday
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<LL-Away> Im away from any comp
<Damos> 13ooooooooooooooo
<Stormy> But I don't really remember
<Stormy> they're not important
<HyperMetalLugia> You'll ..touch her using it
<RedDragonX> didn't he say it was a family member
<Spyrorocks> im sure if his clothes and everything are there it would help the evidence against her.
<LL-Away> and <3
<HyperMetalLugia> ..oh the horror]
<Neon> They should just fuse their bodies together.
<Damos> 13you kids are going to do it on Saturday
<drfsupercenter> 03hey
<drfsupercenter> 03we aren't kids
<HyperMetalLugia> DAMOS XD
<Neon> Friend of family.
<LL-Away> :3
<RedDragonX> oh friend of the family
<Charles> yes, but it would be even better if HE was there too
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm now 20 so I'm not even a teenager
<HyperMetalLugia> Sad
<Neon> But the animosity he has is unmistakable.
<LL-Away> were adults~
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Spyrorocks> she seriously sits on her laptop and listens to music while browing facebook all day
<Spyrorocks> paid for by the government.
<drfsupercenter> 03I missed out on one of the best parts of being a teen :(
<Damos> 13your technically not a grown up yet
<RedDragonX> well he isn't exactly very skilled at hiding hatred for others
<Damos> 13You can't drink
<Stormy> He's kind of always like this
<LL-Away> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03EW ALCOHOL
<RedDragonX> he's just a 16 year old with an attutide
<HyperMetalLugia> He can drink here lol
<Charles> Neon, I demand that you date this girl, and move in with her, so that Spyro can report her
<LL-Away> he can vote
<nickstr> or gamble
<LL-Away> he can kill
<HyperMetalLugia> 16 for doing it here ;p and 18 for smoking/drinking/driving
<LL-Away> @armed forces
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<RedDragonX> or 17
<Neon> Alright, let me get strung out on illicit drugs first so she'll find me appealing.
<RedDragonX> whatever
<RedDragonX> who failed his drivers test lol
<Neon> Then I'll definitely do that.
<Charles> hmm
<Spyrorocks> she was really into me before i told her i couldn't be less interested.
<Stormy> He did?
<Stormy> Aww
<LL-Away> hes an adult
<Stormy> Poor kid
<LL-Away> etc
<RedDragonX> lol
*LL-Away aways
<RedDragonX> I'm not sensing any sarcasm :P
<Neon> I know a lot of people who failed it.
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh well, Wii kinect and move up and down right?
<Neon> It's not that uncommon.
<Stormy> I failed it my first time
<HyperMetalLugia> ;X
<Charles> Neon, you prolly have a job, and therefore money, so she will find you attractive
<Stormy> horribly
<RedDragonX> I almost failed the written part
<RedDragonX> the driving part was easy
<Stormy> then I just barely passed last summer before going back to school
<Charles> just...wear protection...girls like that usually have some sort of "infection"
<Neon> That's right. The greener I am the more attractive I become. I might as well be Kermit the Frog.
<Stormy> Had to pay like $40 for the license because I'm over 18
<Aeroslash> night all
*HyperMetalLugia gets back to his rocking chair and old consoles
<RedDragonX> blarg
<SilverSonic> I need to find a Job
<SilverSonic> for real
<SilverSonic> *sigh*
<RedDragonX> All I had to do was drive to wal mart, park the car, then drive back
<Stormy> that's really all your test was?
<Stormy> wow
<Neon> I'm the only person I know who's afraid to get a job and a driver's license, and has no desire to attain either.
<RedDragonX> yep
<Stormy> damn
<RedDragonX> that's New Hampshire for you
<RedDragonX> the written part was a pain in the ass
<Neon> I'm going to use multiple proxies on our dates, just to be safe.
<Stormy> I was afraid to get a drivers license and a job for a long time
<Stormy> Especially the license
<Stormy> that
<Stormy> that's why I held on to my permit for so long
<RedDragonX> well don't you feel better now :D
<SilverSonic> I Need to find a fucking job for real
<Neon> Not really. xD
<Stormy> lol
<SilverSonic> *sigh* I'm sick of feeling so worthless

<CoCa-C0La> I was gonna ask if we can rename Chanserv to BlargMonster
<Aristeo> xD
<Stormy> PLEASE?!
<CoCa-C0La> yes I am that bored lol
<Aristeo> We'd have to do it across the network xD
<Neon> No, we need to name ChanServ "SkyNet."
<Lambda> please!
<Stormy> That is the best idea ever!
<Aristeo> It's ike changing your nick :3
<Stormy> :P
<CoCa-C0La> screw Skynet
<Lambda> Or that!
<Neon> You don't screw with SkyNet.
<Neon> Arnolds start popping up everywhere when that happens.

<Aristeo> oneeeeeeeeeeee more month of being student government president
<Aristeo> and then it's done :3

<Stormy> about ChanServ being renamed
<CoCa-C0La> not like anyone really talks around here lol

<Aristeo> That's actually a good idea!
<HyperMetalLugia> lolkay
<Neon> I'm not actually gonna add that, don't worry.
<CoCa-C0La> lol
<Stormy> We should make every other word turn into "muffin" or "cucumber"
<Lambda> I muffin think cucumber is a muffin idea
<Stormy> Exactly
<Stormy> :P
<CoCa-C0La> mojito
<Neon> Filters are kind of just annoying.
<Neon> But they might work.
<Aristeo> On this online game I play, they censor the word "analogy" as $@#!logy
<CoCa-C0La> I'm still waiting for you to get on Star Trek Online
<Stormy> XD
<CoCa-C0La> I need somebody else to start a fleet with lol
<SheenaFox> lol.
<HyperMetalLugia> So sheena, anything fun?
<SheenaFox> no x_x
<SheenaFox> talking in front of people is not fun

<CoCa-C0La> That means you two also
<Aristeo> I'm more into the fantasy medieval stuff xD
<Lambda> me too Aristeo

<Aristeo> I need someone to start a guild with
<Lambda> what game?
<CoCa-C0La> :(
<Aristeo> Allods Online
<Aristeo> It's free :3
<Lambda> oh, nevermind
<Neon> Robo-Dwarves from Middle-Matrix.
<nickstr> in fact, there is another reason why I said to avoid Bulbagarden earlier on

<Stormy> Let's pay WoW and pay $15 a month for it
<Aristeo> No thanks
<Neon> What, she's Ground?
<Aristeo> Allods Online is like WoW, but it's actually fun to play
<Lambda> XD
<nickstr> plus its more of a clique community
<Neon> She's O Negative and you're Just A.
<Lambda> yes, because we all know Aristeo is a water gym leader
<Lambda> so he would be super effective
<SilverSonic> *sigh* I have no clue what good Nintendo Soundtracks are out there anymore
<Neon> Oh, so he might accidentally kill her if they started a relationship.
<HyperMetalLugia> Have you tried Vortex?
<Aristeo> xD
<SilverSonic> Vortex?
<SilverSonic> never heard of it
<Lambda> no, he wuld just win all of their battles, therefore giving the relationship an unequal balance of power

<Neon> You just had to consume her flesh.
<Aristeo> Oh, no, it was a mutual break up
<Aristeo> She just proposed the motion
<Aristeo> I seconded it
<Neon> Her parents influenced her?
<Aristeo> The board chair asked for any objection, and seeing no objection, he ruled that the motion carries
<Aristeo> She wasn't really the right person for me
<Aristeo> And she liked me but her parents didn't want her dating anyone

<Aristeo> But
<Aristeo> She ditched me for someone else at the homecoming dance :(
<Neon> She doesn't appear to be very delicious.
<RedDragonX> what a bitch
<Aristeo> So *depressed face* :(
<Aristeo> Yeah
<RedDragonX> I feel like being blunt
<RedDragonX> I'm drinking tonight
<Neon> M'kay.
<Aristeo> I was thinking the whole time "Wow, this girl is beautiful, smart, and we have SOOO much in common! What could possibly be wrong with her?" xD
<RedDragonX> never ever think that
*Lambda is tempted to @addquote <Aristeo> She wasn't really the right person for me. <Neon> So you ate her. WE Know!
<RedDragonX> something is always amist
<Aristeo> Well, I didn't think that the whole time :3
*Aristeo exaggurated
<Aristeo> But I did think that once
<Aristeo> She was hotsauce though
<Chimera> fffffffffffffffffbed
<Aristeo> And nicesauce, and hadlotsincommonwithhersauce
<Lambda> no wonder
<Neon> If you addquote, fix my typo.
<Chimera> brb
<Lambda> will do Neon
<Chimera> 04brb
<Aristeo> And, yeah. Ditched me.
<Aristeo> Now they're going out
<Lambda> those are some fine mixes of herbs and spices right there
<Neon> I think she was tipped off to your cannibalism.
<Neon> And fled for her life into the arms of another date.
<Aristeo> And I had to block her from my Facebook wall after seeing quotes like "That was an amazing night last night... never thought sex could feel so good"
<Aristeo> Well, not quotes... just one
<Aristeo> Again, another exagguration
<Stormy> ew
<Aristeo> Yeah >.<
<Neon> Painful.
<Stormy> Why would anyone think the whole world wants to hear that?
<Neon> Reckless intercourse is in vogue.
<Aristeo> She got a like from her bf and a lot of friends who were like "haha, finalyl got laid lolzrawr"
<SheenaFox|Afk> brbshower
<Aristeo> So
<Aristeo> I has hunting hat on again
<Neon> They actually said lolzrawr?
<Aristeo> No, another exagguration :(
<Lambda> Aristeo: Catcher in the Rye reference?
<Neon> Oh, just a little embellishment.
<Aristeo> :3
<Neon> Not really. It's older than that.
<Aristeo> :3 :3
<Lambda> oh, you mean you're going hunting for girls
<SilverSonic> ok
<Neon> Wait, he's a Ballchinian.
<Aristeo> Yeah, not for eating though
<Lambda> I thought you meant like how he puts his hat on when he's lonely
<Stormy> haha
<Aristeo> I don't think I'm gonna find anyone down here though xD
*Aristeo is too different :3
<Lambda> still thinking of moving to Canadaland?
*Aristeo nods
<Neon> I think you should have two separate partners. One for the gradual consumption, and one for actual dating.
*Aristeo is really interested in Canabananada
<RedDragonX> I hate you
<Aristeo> Neon: That's my plan
*Aristeo loves RedDragonX though
<Neon> Good man.
<Aristeo> RedDragonX: Are you and Rain going out?
*Neon 's eyes grow wide and he waits expectantly.
<RedDragonX> not at the moment why?
<Aristeo> Just curious.... I like keeping track of these things
<RedDragonX> I'd like to but I can't really do that at this point and time
<Aristeo> Because I think she likes you
<RedDragonX> I know she does
<Neon> What he means by that is that he's saving the food for later.
<Stormy> You and Glace broke up then?
<RedDragonX> can't date a JW
<Stormy> Ah
<RedDragonX> wants me to convert
*Aristeo googles
<RedDragonX> and I aint doing that shit
<Aristeo> Oh
<Lambda> She was a JW?
<RedDragonX> yes
<Aristeo> Reminds me of when I went out with Aerieza xD
<RedDragonX> great girl
<RedDragonX> just too hell bent on the JW crap
<Aristeo> ooooh
<RedDragonX> they think the world is gonna end within the next four years or something
<Aristeo> RedDragonX: you ARE being blunt tonight xD
<RedDragonX> I don't have to work tomorrow
*Aristeo grabs some poopcorn
<RedDragonX> that means I get to party tonight
<Aristeo> erm
<Lambda> lucky lucky
*Aristeo washes his hands and opts for the popcorn instead
<Stormy> I have to study tonight... some time
<Lambda> throw my hands up. they're plain' mah song. It's a party in the IRC
<Neon> I get to have a nice little party tomorrow, also known as school.
<RedDragonX> studying is for wimps
<Lambda> *playin'
<Stormy> Shut up you
<Neon> XD
<RedDragonX> :O
<Stormy> I'll fail if I don't
<RedDragonX> :(
<Neon> Slapping with trouts like yeah.
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy> hahaha
*Lambda slaps Neon with a 4r8a9i11n13b17o26w trout
<Neon> I'd love to discover the secret of how to move something like "yeah."
*RedDragonX was yelled at and cries
<Lambda> Neon: as would all modern physicists
*Aristeo points to the girl who left a message on his facebook profile!
<Neon> It must be some advanced scientific principle I haven't been taught.

<RedDragonX> that depends on the girl lol

*Aristeo wonders what the 7 and 6 are doing in there
<Aristeo> I've never heard of a rainb7o6w before

<Lambda> She be taken
<Stormy> umm
<Neon> That sounds like a terrific idea.
<Chimera> Hi
<Aristeo> xD
<RedDragonX> not if i ask her out first
*Chimera floofs on Bree
<Stormy> Go ahead if you want me to say no :P
<Aristeo> If it's not awkard in here, I'm not doing my job
<Neon> xD
<Neon> Me either.
<Lambda> I was just gonna say
<Umbreon> 12eeep
<Lambda> "thought that was Neon's job"
<Aristeo> I make things awkward in real life situations
<Aristeo> Like in my mini-course on Monday
<Aristeo> I'd tell that story.... but I want to respect channel decorum :3
<Neon> I think there's a phenomenon among netizens to become jaded to what used to be social taboo.
*Lambda salutes the channel tapestry
*Stormy looks around and sees no decorum
<Neon> OH, WHAT A NICE MOTIF
<Aristeo> Should I tell the story? :o
<Stormy> if it's not against RedDragonX's rules
<Lambda> 7DO EET
<Neon> Does it involve balloons?
<RedDragonX> what isn't?
*Aristeo checks his rules
<Stormy> XD
<Neon> It's deifnitely against my code of laws.
<Neon> Sorry, can't be done.

<Aristeo> Well
<Aristeo> Oay
<Aristeo> Okay*
<Lambda> deif-knittly
<Stormy> That would have been perfect if Kja logged in right now
<Aristeo> I didn't get suspended or anything, so, surely I can tell the story :3
<Aristeo> So
<Neon> Haha, yes. He'd come in, call us noobs in orange text, then abruptly leave.
<Chimera> SPARKYYYYmouse
<RedDragonX> what isn't against the rules
*Chimera chews
<RedDragonX> don't leave the drunk guy in the dark
<Stormy> RedDragonX, Aristeo has a story
<Lambda> ummmm
<Neon> I think that's exactly where you should be.
<RedDragonX> he does?
<Stormy> Apparently
*Aristeo nods
<RedDragonX> about?
<Lambda> guurrrlz
<Aristeo> I was in class, my first day in the mini course for American Lit
<Chimera> :3
<Neon> oh i luv gurlz
<RedDragonX> sex drugs and rock and roll
*Chimera asdfs on Sneas for his lateness
<Aristeo> I knew a few people in there since English 101, and this was my fourth class with her
<Aristeo> So we had a camaraderie already going on
<Aristeo> So
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Aristeo> When we got questions right, or said the correct answer in class duirng the lecture, the instructor would hand out prizes to try to keep us awake and interested
<Neon> Please tell me you don't eat this one.
<Lambda> XD
<Aristeo> :3
<Aristeo> Sooooooooooo
<Lambda> man, you ruined the story
<Lambda> now I know what's gonna happen
<Lambda> jk, continue Aristeo
<Aristeo> I got a bouncy ball, and, the lady in front of me who I knew, about 30-40 years old, got a magic wand, and the guy beside her got a bouncy ball
<Lambda> a REAL magic wand?
<Aristeo> So there we were, she had her magic wand, the two of us had bouncy balls
<Aristeo> Yes, but it ran out of magic
<Stormy> aww
<Stormy> that's no fun
<Lambda> so a tree branch?

<Rhyme> spoiler: 1,1you have a small penis that will never satisfy your girlfriend.
<SilverSonic> o-o
<Soyuz> bad Rhyme
<Aristeo> And they were playing around, and he gave her the bouncy ball ... then she made a joke like ".... all I need is another ball and I'll have the whole package"
<Rhyme> >+C
<Neon> So it became an alchemist's tool, then.
<Rhyme> uhm

<nickstr> wow
<nickstr> in fact diesel engines can run on just about any flammable solution except gasoline
<nickstr> you can run them on vegetable oil, animal fats, kerosene, lamp oil, and other things
<nickstr> plus here is a little known fact
<Neon> http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk263/A_Grim_Reminder/Gaddafistick.jpg
<Sparky> hi
<Sparky> o3o
<nickstr> the engine's inventor Rudolph Diesel envisioned it to run on peanut oil originally
<Sparky> … I knew that XD
<Lambda> XD
<Zangoose> Lamp oil, rope, bombs, you want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
<Armageddon> ohai
<Armageddon> Altair's not on @ Chimera
<Sparky> lol
<Chimera> Oh
<Umbreon> 12nickstr
<Chimera> Sorry xD
<Umbreon> 12does it run on rocks?
<nickstr> for animal fats you have to add a special agent to keep from jelling up the injectors
<nickstr> no
<Sparky> olfkdajfdls I really want to do an MAD with this song or something
<Chimera> I thought my lag was terrible or something
<Zangoose> dissolve charcoal in water, make fuel, profit!
<Sparky> o3o
<Chimera> Armageddon are you in class still or something? o.o
<Sparky> … but…
<Sparky> that's water…
*Chimera nom Sparkymouse
<nickstr> plus ever heard of wood gasification?
<Armageddon> yes
<Zangoose> or somehow invent liquid charcoal
<Chimera> Liquid charcoal lol
<Zangoose> nope, but i can get the basic idea from the name
<nickstr> gasoline engines can run on gasses generated from charing wood in a sealed container
<nickstr> but the problem is the stuff is acidic
*Sparky is nommed
<Sparky> ssssssssssssssssssssss
<nickstr> eventually it can harm some parts of the engine
<Zangoose> acids are nomnomnom
<Sparky> omg creepersssssssssssssssssss

<drfsupercenter> 03ignore the highlight
<drfsupercenter> 03same line
<drfsupercenter> 03the top line on the left
<Sparky> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03with the name
<Sparky> Hiroko
<drfsupercenter> 03OK

<Sparky> XD''
<drfsupercenter> 03in a few minutes
<Sparky> oh, sure
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so Silvia = Hiroko
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm basically making a list
<drfsupercenter> 03with their English names
<Sparky> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03from Pokémon White
<Sparky> nice
<drfsupercenter> 03as that save editor is only Japanese x.x
<Sparky> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03basically
<drfsupercenter> 03it edits the people in White Forest
<Sparky> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03because
<drfsupercenter> 03thanks to Nintendo
<drfsupercenter> 03I lost all but 4
<drfsupercenter> 03there should be 10 people
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm trying to put the other 6 back XD
<Sparky> ah
<drfsupercenter> 03but in the process I'm helping my friend out
<drfsupercenter> 03as he only has a list of the English names
<drfsupercenter> 03as in, which Pokémon they're responsible for bringing in/out of hte forest
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm just doing JP -> English
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/xuqq7.png
<drfsupercenter> 03OK, that's the next one
<Sparky> o3o
<Sparky> Satoko
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<Sparky> … lol that's Ashley's JP name
<Sparky> :'D
<drfsupercenter> 03how do you translate from Japanese symbols to letters
*Sparky remembers Ashley
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't want to say Kanji as I think that's wrong
<drfsupercenter> 03is it katakana?
<Sparky> lol
<Sparky> yeah, in this case it's katakana
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I confuse them XD
<Sparky> the curlier ones are hiragana
<Sparky> like "なし"
<drfsupercenter> 03isn't there a furigana too?
<Sparky> in katakana would be "ナシ"
<Sparky> furigana is the tiny letters written on the sides/top of kanji (depending on the orientation)
<Sparky> okurigana is the hiragana/katakana that comes after the kanji
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL THAT CHARACTER
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks like a fricking face
<Sparky> …
<Sparky> XD
<Sparky> I NEVER noticed that
<Light_Latias> lolz
<drfsupercenter> 03I keep referring to that as the "Japanese smiley face"
<drfsupercenter> 03what IS that anyawy
<Sparky> lol
<Sparky> "SHI"
<SilverSonic> シ
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah that
<drfsupercenter> 03LKOL
<drfsupercenter> 03*LOL
<Sparky> :'D
<drfsupercenter> 03OH シ...

<drfsupercenter> 03hm

<junh1024-XD> amirite?
<drfsupercenter> 03Satoko = Britney
<Sparky> ツ
<Rhyme> deep inside these burning buildings voices die to be heard
<junh1024-XD> hard to tell the difference, ae drf?
<Sparky> careful of getting the katakana for "shi" and "Tsu" mixed up XD
<Rhyme> years we spend teaching a lesson, we ourselves had never learned

<drfsupercenter> 03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/funny-facebook-fails-deaf-win.jpg
<Ascendant> and if the IP is in the blacklist then it bans it
<drfsupercenter> 03eh bans
<drfsupercenter> 03more trouble than they're worth
<drfsupercenter> 03you get one that one genuine good person who tries to connect but you think he's a botnet
<drfsupercenter> 03and etc etc
<Ascendant> drf lol, when you get 300 user botnet attacks
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd be like

<drfsupercenter> 03http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/koma-comic-strip-outrageous.jpg <- LOL
<junh1024-XD> so drfsupercenter, I tried to extract some file from a 7z which had a * in the filename. using winrar, i got error. And * is illegal in filenames.
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<junh1024-XD> I was finally able to extract it using the unarchiver on mac, because * is legal on mac filesystems
<drfsupercenter> 03or, you just rename it
<drfsupercenter> 03I know it's rocket science
<junh1024-XD> I can't. it's in an archive.
<drfsupercenter> 03give me a link to the archive
<junh1024-XD> 7z archive.
<drfsupercenter> 03again give me a link to it
<junh1024-XD> http://www.fileserve.com/file/kG8NpnP
<drfsupercenter> 03wow 941MB
<drfsupercenter> 03well, downloading
<drfsupercenter> 035 mins remaining
<junh1024-XD> so if you're a band., don't have *s in your band name
*junh1024-XD hides
<drfsupercenter> 03you also could have used Linux you know :P
<drfsupercenter> 03Mac filesystem isn't any different than Linux filesystem
<nickstr> Mac OS uses a totally different file system than Linux
<junh1024-XD> I could have started up my xubuntu VM on my mac, but that'd be jumping through hoops.
<nickstr> Mac OS X uses HFS
<drfsupercenter> 03no, I know it uses HFS
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean the actual naming scheme
<drfsupercenter> 03both are based on UNIX.
<nickstr> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why the terminal is the same
<drfsupercenter> 03well, the commands rather
<junh1024-XD> orer, POSIX
<nickstr> not if you consider the kernel but I am splitting hairs
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<nickstr> Mac OS X uses the Mach kernel which is somewhat related to BSD UNIX
<junh1024-XD> mach-O , iirc
<nickstr> I am not totally sure about the exact name but I do know its Mach
<nickstr> taken from NeXT Step and Openstep
<drfsupercenter> 03wow
<drfsupercenter> 03that totally killed Windows Exploer
<drfsupercenter> 03*Explorer
<nickstr> what did
<drfsupercenter> 03trying to extract that 7z
<nickstr> weird
<nickstr> well I am having fun here
<nickstr> testing the Playlist.com interface
<nickstr> its working
<nickstr> the pages load without a problem
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I can't rename the files
<Umbreon> 12i hate nightmares
<nickstr> so do I

<Umbreon> 12heh
<nickstr> I have had dreams though
<junh1024-XD> yeah, see @ drf?
<nickstr> just not nightmares
<Drake> 04fairly good

<drfsupercenter> 03there's no such thin
<drfsupercenter> 03g
<junh1024-XD> there are also some illegal folder names, such as prn and com1
<nickstr> interesting that HFS would block those things
<junh1024-XD> nah, its only illegal on windows

<nickstr> man I HATE the Android 2.2 low battery alert
<nickstr> its way too loud and scares the crap out of me every time
<junh1024-XD> nickstr actually it does. try making a new folder called PRN or COM1 .
<nickstr> oh yea
<drfsupercenter> 03weird
<nickstr> sure is
<drfsupercenter> 03so you can't forget that o when naming a porn folder
*drfsupercenter runs
<junh1024-XD> nah, i actually found that out in 2005 when i was attempting to name a folder called prn, short for print.
<junh1024-XD> and i was like, Y I CAN"T DO DIS! DO I HAVE VIRUS?
<junh1024-XD> no i don't, but its one of those windows things. and if you do manage to name a folder called prn or com1, say, a mac over the network, bad things will happen.

<drfsupercenter> 03I sent FMA a router and he bricked it
<nickstr> and I thought he was a tech person
<drfsupercenter> 03he is
<nickstr> how did that happen
<drfsupercenter> 03no idea
<nickstr> how did you debrick it
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't
<drfsupercenter> 03he still has it
<nickstr> let me guess
<nickstr> DD-WRT firmware
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I wanted him to make it run faster for me
<drfsupercenter> 03as even using stock firmware it was going hellishly slow
<nickstr> just like my WRT54G v8
<drfsupercenter> 03he went to flash it and bricked it
<drfsupercenter> 03this was a WRT150N
<drfsupercenter> 03the one HE recommended to me
<Drake> 04o-o
<junh1024-XD> this is why i don't so dis.
<junh1024-XD> risk or brock.
<Drake> 04;:|
<junh1024-XD> *of brick
<Drake> 04:|
<nickstr> I hacked mine
<nickstr> its quite happy with the custom firmware
<nickstr> plus the features are incredible
<junh1024-XD> wut features?
<junh1024-XD> lik,e hosting ur own servar?
<drfsupercenter> 03virtual access points for one
<drfsupercenter> 03you can have as many as you want on one router
<Drake> 04some weird tech talk
<nickstr> Wake On LAN, bandwidth management, access point features, revenue generating ads
*Drake listens
<Drake> 04or reads
<Drake> 04w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<junh1024-XD> ads, reveneue. really?>
<nickstr> I can't list everything in DD-WRT
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> if you are a business using a router with the firmware
<nickstr> the bandwidth monitoring features might be useful for you Jun
<nickstr> to let you know when you are approaching your monthly cap
<junh1024-XD> i just login to my ISP's page
<nickstr> ok
<nickstr> DD-WRT lets you do that from the router firmware
<nickstr> you just have to be using a modern web browser with the Adobe SVG plugin
<junh1024-XD> i herd SVG was gettin ditched or something
<nickstr> I have no idea
<nickstr> but most browsers should have it
<nickstr> you can also do things like increase the transmit power for WIFI
<nickstr> I boosted it a little bit
<nickstr> in fact given this I recommend the WRT54G
<nickstr> for a couple reasons
<nickstr> 1. they are cheap plus 802.11g is fine for most people
<nickstr> and 2. most versions can run DD-WRT and some up to version 5 can run Tomato
<nickstr> the WRT54GL I also recommend
<Armageddon> DRAKE
*Armageddon pokes
<Armageddon> have you read Reminiscence?
*Drake tackles
<Drake> 04I read some of it
<Armageddon> go read the rest then
<Armageddon> I spent 6 months writing it >:B
<Ascendant> lol WRT54
<Ascendant> WRTs are decent
<Ascendant> sometimes
<junh1024-XD> i have a wired modem from D_LINK
<nickstr> the official VXWorks firmware is crap though
<nickstr> the two I mentioned are pretty much identical except for one thing
<nickstr> the WRT54GL uses Linux based firmware
<Umbreon> 12oh hi Armageddon
<Umbreon> 12!fight Armageddon
*Nightshadow|VNC uses Stealth Rock on Armageddon! It's not very effective... Armageddon loses 15 HP! Armageddon has 985 HP left!
<nickstr> as does the WRT54G up to version 5
<Umbreon> 12that's not a damaging attack D:
<Armageddon> o_o
<EpicStatsGuy> wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Umbreon> 12what?
<Armageddon> XD
<Ascendant> Dlink lol
<junh1024-XD> vxworks RTOS, ae?
<Ascendant> they're okay
<Umbreon> 12interesting
<Ascendant> better than speedstream -_-
<nickstr> it sucks to say the least
<Umbreon> 12the only reason to get an apple device is for the autocorrect
<Ascendant> speedstream routers
<Umbreon> 12it's a natural comedian
<Ascendant> mfw
<nickstr> in fact I am starting to see VXWorks as an oxymoron now
<Ascendant> and ATT routers
<Umbreon> 12pff
<Ascendant> AWW HELL NAW
<Ascendant> also kinda afk going to be like
<Ascendant> configuring bind9
<Ascendant> and failing
<nickstr> <%Umbreon> it's a natural comedian <-- so is the voice recognition on Android phones
<nickstr> some of the mistakes I have seen one make are HILARIOUS
*Armageddon pokes Prince-dari
<nickstr> one of the best was mistaking "his track meet" for "histerectomy"

<Drake> 04I'd rather see if we can do it first.
<Drake> 04I'll ask Ben if he can make the scenery and backgrounds in Blender as well.
<Armageddon> lmfao Umbreon
<Drake> 04He's pretty good at making models, so I figured it wouldn't be too hard to make a background.

<Angel_Espeon> 13Ew Arceus
*Angel_Espeon is shot
<nickstr> actually I agree
<NightSeas> 12Same, lol

<lightumbreon> yea, the winner would be...

*lightumbreon hides
<nickstr> I have actually used perhaps the most underrated water Pokemon ever
<nickstr> Politoed
<lightumbreon> ....XD
<nickstr> well think of it this way
<nickstr> Politoed can cover for its weaknesses very effectively
<nickstr> and can learn some interesting attacks
<nickstr> mine WON against a very powerful Luxray
<nickstr> one shotted it with earthquake
<lightumbreon> i know, it's a very interesting but sometimes weaker pkmn
<NightSeas> 12Hello J Lugia :3
<J-Lugia> heya
<nickstr> Poliwrath can't learn many of the attacks that Politoed can which cover for its weakneses
<nickstr> Poliwrath is weak against grass, electric, and psychic attacks
<nickstr> where as Politoed is weak just against grass and electric
<nickstr> but can cover for said weaknesses

<drfsupercenter> 03computer DVD drives tend to be more um

<Skylands> 10k
<drfsupercenter> 03http://mrbass.org/dvdrip/SetupDVDDecrypter_3.5.4.0.exe
<Skylands> 10Only one of the four DVDs are in perfect condition, it almost looks brand new
<drfsupercenter> 03basically
<drfsupercenter> 03what you want to do is
<drfsupercenter> 03set DVD Decrypter to Mode -> ISO -> Read
<drfsupercenter> 03then just write the disc to an .iso file
<drfsupercenter> 03if it completes with no read errors
<drfsupercenter> 03then you can burn it using whatever
<Skylands> 10I have a program to copying DVDs already
<drfsupercenter> 03which program?
<Skylands> 10Dunno, waiting for my dad to get home
<Skylands> 10It's on his desktop
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03just use DVD Decrypter, trust me
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the only real way to get exact copies XD
<Skylands> 10Do I click DVD Burning or Ripping?
<drfsupercenter> 03ripping
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.afterdawn.com/articles/DVDDec01_02valitseISO.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what you want
<Spyrorocks> A good way to find an OBIT is to visit heating repair places. Just like NSTs at the sign shops, these places often have some old OBITs in the back room. Simply ask nicely, and give a good reason for wanting them. Say you want to make a tesla coil or something, not just lolzimgunnashokstuf.
<Skylands> 10Can't find the file
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what

<Spyrorocks> Inside you'll find the transformer and the x-ray tube. Save the x-ray tube because they typically go for about $50 on ebay. If you like you could save it for future experiments, maybe make a nightlight out of it. Hell you could throw it at somebody if you feel like it, that choice is up to you.

<Mikey> what happened
<NightSeas> 12followed by, Axew Espeon and Umbreon
<Stormy> he just kept making stupid comments about everything SR said
<Stormy> finally SR got sick of it and said something like
<Stormy> "Nothing you've said so far has been remotely funny or informative"
<NightSeas> 12Mew is my favorite 1st gen Pokemon :3
<Stormy> So Neon said "Who are you anyway? Are you from my forum?"
<SilverSonic> I just noticed TST is back up
<nickstr> its a toss up for me
<Stormy> Then he was pretending Aristeo eats girls

<Steve> 12 Hello, Kjakings and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<NightSeas> 12And it's generic free
<Kjakings> 7'tis an Aicebo
<Damos> 13LOL you look for free name
<NightSeas> 12Erm, generic means that a lot of people use it
<Damos> 13jk
<Stormy> hi
<NightSeas> 12Oh, lol
<Kjakings> 7hey
<Kjakings> 7I'm bored, the forums I frequent are down. I'm grasping at straws for entertainment
<Kjakings> 7you like adoptables/pet sites?
<NightSeas> 12I remember when I first joined I tried to enter Lugia as my name not thinking it was taken XDD
<Damos> 13HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHIMERA
<Stormy> Aristeo, that video still hasn't loaded yet
<Stormy> D:
<Stormy> depends on what they are, but generally
<NightSeas> 12Also, happy birthday Chimera /late
<Kjakings> 7coolio. I have some invites for Gryffs and I think it counts as a petsite because each one has a degree of individuality
*Aristeo likes old-school Disney movies :3
<Aristeo> <333333333 The Hunchback of Notre Dame
<Kjakings> 7Aristocats ftw
<Mikey> EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A CAT
<Kjakings> 7better than an owl
<NightSeas> 12AngelicLugia is the better out of all the generic Lugia names XD
<Mikey> except ayumi he wants to be a wolf
<NightSeas> 12Mine was the worst
<Mikey> he needs to get with the program
<Kjakings> 7haven't heard from ayumi in a while
<Mikey> he tried to talk to me a while back
<Kjakings> 7I look back on him with a sense of nostalgia
<Mikey> agreed
<Stormy> lol Ayumi
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13Should've given yourself an Espeon name
<Damos> 13Lugiapower
<Damos> 13hows that?
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13because Espeon is never generic
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13:B
<Kjakings> 7we need to turn this place into new SC
<Damos> 13hey ANgy
<Stormy> is he still trying to get unbanned from SF?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yo~
<NightSeas> 12Never enough Espeon ~
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Mikey> the saddest part is that he still wants to come back after what...3 years
<Damos> 13!espeon !chimera
*Chimera now belongs to Damos for 12 minutes
*Espeon now belongs to Damos for 15 minutes
<Damos> 13SHINY!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02hi
<Kjakings> 7god who even cares any more? SF is taking its last sputtering breaths as the life support machine loses power
<Stormy> and yeah, we should
<NightSeas> 12Heys Shiny-Growlithe :3
<Mikey> indeed
<Espeon> 06Hi Shiny :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02hi
<Kjakings> 7I'm not sure what exactly the life support machine is in that metaphor
<Kjakings> 7I'm leaning towards SR but if that's the case then the power cut was a while ago
<Mikey> it was LoS but even now they're not doing that anyways
<Mikey> oh
<Stormy> the number of active members maybe?
<Chimera> 04hi drf
<Damos> 13hey drfy
<Skylands> 10I hate the stuff we ate
<SilverSonic> AE, pm?
<NightSeas> 12lol, what was it
<Kjakings> 7that depends on whether Thor is out in america yet
<Skylands> 10Chicken stirfry
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Damos> 13My package hasn't arrived yet
<NightSeas> 12I'm having rice and egg rules for dinner
<Damos> 13I'm am so looking foward to the Electronic Lugia
<Damos> 13but I wonder if its going to ever get here
<NightSeas> 12Do they make good Chicken?
<NightSeas> brb
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Woah, wild Tyrannitar. O___o
<Chimera> hihi
<Skylands> 10[17:34] <Damos> I'm am so looking foward to the Electronic Lugia <- I bet that was expensive
<Skylands> 10If you are referring to the old Hasbro one
<Chimera> 04SL
<Chimera> 04WHERE
<Chimera> 04O________O
<Prince-dari> @looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooongcatmeter

<Damos> 13hello hello
<Prince-dari> Lol.
<Mikey> @straightmeter dari
<Steve> 6 dari is 90% straight. (312)
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yeah, an outbreak of Tyrannitar. XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm about to get my White Forest fixed. :D
<Kjakings> 7aah
<Shadow_Lugia> 6o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03EW POKÉMON TURNING INTO ANIMAL CROSSING
<Prince-dari> I wonder what the other 10% is.
<Damos> 13well idk
<drfsupercenter> 03basically, for every day you don't talk to the people in White Forest/Black City, they have a better chance of leaving
<Skylands> 10Whut
<drfsupercenter> 03INCLUDING WHEN YOU START THE GAME
<Stormy> It skipped 311
<drfsupercenter> 03so in other words
<drfsupercenter> 03if you don't beat the game in 4 days or less
<Prince-dari> Wth.
<drfsupercenter> 03goodbye to some people
<drfsupercenter> 03x.x
<Damos> 13it was only $50.00 something
<Shadow_Lugia> 6D:
<Shadow_Lugia> 6WAT.
<drfsupercenter> 03and those people take with them the ability to catch old Pokémon
<Kjakings> 7speaking of not entirely straight people, where's Neon?
<HyperMetalLugia> Only 4 days .c.
<drfsupercenter> 03now, luckily I have a save editor ;P
<HyperMetalLugia> Evil
<Mikey> it skipped 311 because amber wasn't the color of your energy *bah dum chhhh*
<Quilava> still afk
<Stormy> @wthmeter Steve
<Steve> 6 Steve is 42% wth. (313)
<Skylands> 10Damos, where'd you buy it?
<Quilava> just had to do something for a sec
<Damos> 13ebay
<Stormy> Neon was just here last night
<Skylands> 10$50 /is/ expensive
<Kjakings> @pileofmoltenshitmeter Steve
<Steve> 6 Steve is 62% pileofmoltenshit. (314)
<Skylands> 10for something such as that
<Kjakings> @pileofmoltenshitmeter Steve
<Steve> 6 Steve is 76% pileofmoltenshit. (315)
<Kjakings> he may have lost confidence
<Stormy> You missed the annoy SR game
<NightSeas> 12Okay, back
<Kjakings> 7aww
<Kjakings> 7why didn't I get an email or something?
<Damos> 13I got a reciept
<Damos> 13so I can get my money back
<Skylands> 10Good thing you did
<Damos> 13but its been 3 weeks now
<Kjakings> 7explain?
<Skylands> 10One of the forum-goers bought one on eBay not too long ago, and they never received it in the mail, and had no receipt, so yeh
<Stormy> Neon just annoyed SR in #epic-chat]
<Kjakings> 7why?
<Skylands> 10They were out of luck
<Kjakings> 7well
<Kjakings> 7I understand in general
<Stormy> whenever he said anything Neon would make some nonsensical comment about it
<Kjakings> 7that's just how he talks
<Damos> 13I just hope it wasn't sent to the wrong address or stolen in the mail
<Viral> ~dns 89.36.225.3
<Kjakings> 7that's a conversation with Neon
*Viral sit
<Viral> wait no
<Viral> !dns 89.36.225.3
<Nightshadow|VNC> Resolved 89.36.225.3 to: ns1.EforieNett.ro
<Viral> ic
<NightSeas> 12Knowing eBay, the seller just kept it
<Prince-dari> Lolz Rebecca Black. Someone told me that song sounds better slowed down 6 times. XD
<Damos> 13brb
<Mikey> it actually does
<Damos> 13back
<Stormy> Well yeah, but he was only doing it to SR
<Kjakings> 7how pissed did SR get?
<Stormy> You should've seen before when he pretended to be sad because SR didn't PM him
<Chimera> 04drf
<Chimera> 04that's why
<Chimera> 04you get White version
<Chimera> 04do NOTHING
<Chimera> 04for a week
<Chimera> 04and then get the C-Gerar
<Chimera> 04*gear
<drfsupercenter> 03but you'd also need someone else
<Stormy> I couldn't really tell
<Stormy> But he was already mad
<Damos> 13but the person I bought it from sells lots of other pokemon stuff
<Chimera> 04connect
<drfsupercenter> 03who has a game
<drfsupercenter> 03who ALSO diddn't do anything for a week
<Chimera> 04to your Black version
<drfsupercenter> 03whatever
<Kjakings> 7why?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd much rather
<Chimera> 04:3
<drfsupercenter> 03just edit them back in
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Chimera> 04Not possible yet
<drfsupercenter> 03as bluesun is a pro like that
<nickstr> I would too
<drfsupercenter> 03yes it is
<Chimera> 04well
<drfsupercenter> 03it's totally possible
<drfsupercenter> 03he's doing it right now
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Chimera> 04in english
<Chimera> 04:V
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03dude
<drfsupercenter> 03the saves are interchangable
<Stormy> He was ranting about some lazy person who lived on welfare or something
<drfsupercenter> 03last night I was playing around with it
<Chimera> 04I mean
<Chimera> 04the program to do it
<drfsupercenter> 03I changed who was in my forest and they were there in English
<Chimera> 04is in japanese
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<nickstr> because I don't know anyone else in my area keeping up with Pokemon games
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not that hard to use actually
<Chimera> 04and the translation is broken
<drfsupercenter> 03you just need to know the names
<Chimera> 04beyond repair ;-;
<Chimera> 04eah I don't
<drfsupercenter> 03you just load the save and click the bottom button
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<nickstr> plus buying another DS Lite and a copy of the opposite version is kind of expensive
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you ask bluesun :P
<Chimera> 04I messed around with entree forest lol
<Stormy> "THE GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR HER DAMN CELL PHONE."
<Kjakings> 7SR was taking the moral highground on laziness?
<Chimera> 04k
<Chimera> 04I'll ask him to remove everybody from White Forest
<Griggs> It's a sex addiction epidemic
<Chimera> 04then make another save with everyone there
<Chimera> 04|D
<drfsupercenter> 03why...
<Chimera> 04un
<Chimera> 04um
<drfsupercenter> 03why not just have him edit your save so everyone;'s there
<Chimera> 04Black City
<Kjakings> 7oh please. he should see the british welfare system
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you want to remove them all
<Chimera> 04duh
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it doesn't work that way
<Stormy> he's not really lazy :P
<drfsupercenter> 03the people you want to show up on the C-Gear
<drfsupercenter> 03are in the "back garden"
<drfsupercenter> 03not 'gone'
<drfsupercenter> 03when they leave the city they go to this back garden thingy
<Stormy> just with stuff he doesn't care about
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why he was able to fix it
<Stormy> ...like SF
<drfsupercenter> 03because it showed who left
<Chimera> 04black garden...?
<drfsupercenter> 03so he's just putting them back
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03Back
<drfsupercenter> 03not black
<Chimera> 04Back garden?
<drfsupercenter> 03there's no real name for it, that's just the name the save editor uses
<Chimera> 04huh?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03picture it as this
<drfsupercenter> 03if I'm at your house
<drfsupercenter> 03and I want to leave your house
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd go out the back door
<drfsupercenter> 03into a ... back garden
<Chimera> 04ah
*drfsupercenter hides
<drfsupercenter> 03again, the name is just what the save editor ues
<drfsupercenter> 03there's no actual yerm for it
<drfsupercenter> 03*term
<Chimera> 04hm
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah, if you just delete all the people, it won't work
<drfsupercenter> 03you need to have 10 people in the back garden
<Chimera> 04fine
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I just got to White Forest. :)
<Chimera> 04I'll tell him to put everyone in the back garden
*Chimera runs
<Damos> 13SL!
<drfsupercenter> 03Shadow_Lugia
<drfsupercenter> 03how many people are there
<Chimera> qut
<Chimera> *wut
<drfsupercenter> 03and I mean, people with names
<drfsupercenter> 03like when you talk to them
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll be like Name: Blah blah
<drfsupercenter> 03if they don't have a name it doesn't count
<drfsupercenter> 03I only had four people when I got there, out of 10 x.x
<nickstr> FAIL
<nickstr> but on Black or White's part
<Shadow_Lugia> 6 2 so far.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Exploring.
<drfsupercenter> 03> bluesun, I made a brand new save
<drfsupercenter> 03> and there are 10 people in the garden, as well as 3 people in the back garden.
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun> k
<drfsupercenter> 03> apparently it just takes 3 people at random
<drfsupercenter> 03> and puts them there
<Kjakings> 7hey, anyone here played DA2?
<nickstr> cool
<nickstr> so you CAN cheat the White Forest/Black City BS
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03you either need to be using a flash card or have a $30 Chinese save dumper XD
<nickstr> no problem
<drfsupercenter> 03because you'd have to get a .sav file from the actual game card
<drfsupercenter> 03I can do it myself, but yeah
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I count 5.
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03also wow
<drfsupercenter> 03I had horrible luck this time
<drfsupercenter> 03on my random new game
<drfsupercenter> 03all but 2 people had a base happiness of 30
<Stormy> no
<drfsupercenter> 03it's usually 5 that are 30 and 5 that are 70
<drfsupercenter> 03that's prolly what happened with Shadow_Lugia
<drfsupercenter> 03base happiness of 30 = they're gone after 4 days
<Kjakings> 7don't. Bioware are dirty bastards
<drfsupercenter> 03base happiness of 70 = 8 days I think?
<Stormy> why?
<Kjakings> 7none of the plot questions from the first game are answered and a hundred and forty seven million new ones are raised
<Chimera> 04hi Angel
<Chimera> 04again o.o
<NightSeas> 12Ji
<Angel_Espy> 13router randomly turned off
<Angel_Espy> 13=w=
<NightSeas> 12*Hi
<Kjakings> 7I wish to smack them repeatedly
<drfsupercenter> 03actually nvm
<drfsupercenter> 03base happiness of 30 = they leave after 6 days
<Stormy> maybe they're making a third one?
<drfsupercenter> 03base happiness of 70 = they leave after 16 days
<Kjakings> 7they are
<Kjakings> 7but it's the way they do it that grates
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun> there's 20,30,70,80
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun> aka 4,6,14,16
<Kjakings> 7Valve do it to raise tension and suspense, they make you think about the subtle plot elements raised
<Kjakings> 7Bioware smack you with interesting questions and then run away singing peter pan songs
<Kjakings> 7honestly
<Kjakings> 7don't tell me of worldwide rebellion, throw in a Leliana cameo and then roll the credits
<Kjakings> 7it's Witch Hunt all over again
<drfsupercenter> 03so nickstr you'd actually consider buying Black or White with the save dumper? XD
<nickstr> perhaps
<nickstr> I would have to do a lot of hacking and cheating to make it playable
<drfsupercenter> 03Doing that it's also possible to edit first-gen Pokémon into your save
<drfsupercenter> 03Not really
<drfsupercenter> 03all I did was give myself a team of 6 first-gens and beat the game with thej
<drfsupercenter> 03*them
<Skylands> 10My dad fails
<Kjakings> 7You are in a forest. You are likely to be eaten by a grue. Suddenly, this comes running at you: http://www.wacabas.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bear-riding-horse.jpg
<Skylands> 10He thought I meant the program for burning music CDs
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
*Skylands facedesks
<Feather> 10gtg
<drfsupercenter> 03:<
<nickstr> hacking Black or White should not be too bad
<Chimera> 04:<
<Chimera> 04bye Feathy...
<Chimera> 04and nickstr
<Chimera> 04hacking it how?
<Chimera> 04Level geometry? Scripts? :V
<drfsupercenter> 03I think he just wants to do what I did
<drfsupercenter> 03and put a team of non crappy Pokémon in there
<nickstr> yes
<drfsupercenter> 03and nickstr, if you want to fight Iris, you'll need White
<nickstr> that and bypass the stupid White Forest and Black City timer
<drfsupercenter> 03I like White better anyway XD, better music etc
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03all you would need to do
<nickstr> I still want to sweep her with a Staryu or Starmie
<drfsupercenter> 03is after you start the game, within 4 days, dump your save
<Chimera> 04[18:00:38] <%drfsupercenter> 03and put a team of non crappy Pokémon in there4 <-- funny thing is my team of 5th gens keeps pwning 1-4th gens
<drfsupercenter> 03then just play the game as you wish
<Chimera> 04one hit all the time
<drfsupercenter> 03mine do the same
<drfsupercenter> 03to 5th gen
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<Chimera> 04and I'm like
<Chimera> 04LOWER LEVEL
<drfsupercenter> 03then you would just take your dumped save and edit the White Forest stuff
<Chimera> 04by 10 or so
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera, same here
<drfsupercenter> 03it's all about type advantages ZXD
<drfsupercenter> 03-Z
<Chimera> 04actually
<Chimera> 04Zweilous keeps pwning people with crunch
<Chimera> 04and Chandelure with shadow ball
<Chimera> 04regardless of types |D
<drfsupercenter> 03my Haunter does that same thing
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03it has low defense
<Armageddon> o_o
<drfsupercenter> 03so I just gotta out-speed themXD
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Chimera> 04Yeah :P
<Armageddon> heya
<Skylands> 10hi
<Chimera> 04Mine aren't the speediest
<Chimera> 04But dang Serperior is freaking fast
<nickstr> I might pass along the Adobe Flash apk that I confirmed to work on ARM-11 devices if anyone wants it
<drfsupercenter> 03my Arcanine is freaking fast too
<Chimera> 04He's suppose to be
<drfsupercenter> 03I've got Flash officially as my phone has 2.2
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly LOL
<Chimera> 04Arcanine's not a starter though :3
<nickstr> mine is the real deal too
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Chimera> 04but
<Chimera> 04he's still cool
<drfsupercenter> 03I think when I start Black
<Armageddon> heya Skylands
<Chimera> 04Stone evos are usually boss
<Chimera> 04:E
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll get a team of 3 starters
<drfsupercenter> 03Chikorita, Charmander, and um
<Armageddon> Hm
<drfsupercenter> 03which generation has the best water type
<Armageddon> Shiny is online
<SilverSonic> ohai NS
<drfsupercenter> 03that isn't 5th
<nickstr> it really is a build for ARM-11 devices of the regular flash player
<Skylands> 10Shiny's on TST's server
<Chimera> 04Right because there's more than one 5th gen water type
<Chimera> 04:P
<Armageddon> Shiny is on here too
<SilverSonic> hes on here too
<Armageddon> not joined to any channels
<drfsupercenter> 03I said STARTER
<Chimera> 04starter
<drfsupercenter> 03wait no I didn't
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean starter
<SilverSonic> i was about to say that xD
<Skylands> 10lolwhy
<Chimera> 04forgot to add that
<drfsupercenter> 03which generatiuon has the best water type starter
<nickstr> second
<Chimera> 04It depends
<nickstr> Totodile
<Chimera> 04lol
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I kinda like Blastoise myself but eh
<Chimera> 04Alligators ftw yeah
<nickstr> Feraligatr is pretty cool though
<Chimera> 04drf
<Chimera> 04are you looking for stats or appearence
<Chimera> 04:P
<drfsupercenter> 03which one is stronger?
<drfsupercenter> 03stats LOL
<Chimera> 04k
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<Chimera> 04lemme check
<drfsupercenter> 03I definitely want Charizard
<drfsupercenter> 03as fire/flying is pro
<drfsupercenter> 03and I just have an attachment to Chikorita XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and Bayleef/Meganium whatever
<Skylands> 10http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/079/c/b/a_winner_is_n_by_mudonite-d3c3enu.png
<drfsupercenter> 03Meganium can learn Leaf Blade, can'tit?
<Chimera> 04I think
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<Chimera> 04But um
<drfsupercenter> 03though I dunno
<Chimera> 04I dunno if its attack is the best
<drfsupercenter> 03is Sceptile stronger than Meganium?
<Chimera> 04lol 82
<Chimera> 04lemme check
<drfsupercenter> 03and I suppose I can go with Totodile for my water type
<Chimera> 04Meganium's attack is 82
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Chimera> 04but its defense is
<drfsupercenter> 03seeing as how most grass attacks are SPECIAL ATTACK
<Chimera> 04100
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't see why that matters
<Chimera> 04um
<Chimera> 04Leaf Blade?
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<drfsupercenter> 03nvm
<Chimera> 0485
<Chimera> 04for Sceptile
<drfsupercenter> 03so in other words only barely better
<Chimera> 04but 105 special attack
<drfsupercenter> 03what's Meganium's special attack
<Chimera> 0484 XD
<drfsupercenter> 03o_o
<drfsupercenter> 03what's Sceptile's defense?
<Chimera> 04erm no, 83 I think
<Chimera> 0465
<drfsupercenter> 03ew
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's stronger but weaker
<drfsupercenter> 03I like tanking grass types LOL
<Chimera> 04Sceptile's more speed and attack apparently
<drfsupercenter> 03just because they seem to be the weakest type
<Chimera> 04120 speed
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like LOL FIRE BLAST
<drfsupercenter> 03what's Meganium's speedd?
<drfsupercenter> 03-d
<Chimera> 04LOL Sceptile's actually faster than serperior
<Chimera> 04um
<Chimera> 04slow
<Chimera> 04very
<Chimera> 04slow
<Chimera> 0480
<drfsupercenter> 03so you'd suggest going with Treecko over Chikorita?
<Chimera> 04Hm
<Chimera> 04It kinda depends
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Chimera> 04I mean, its faster
<Chimera> 04and has higher attack
<drfsupercenter> 03my others will be Charizard and Feraligatr
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah
<Chimera> 04So if you can tank its attacks with ones that'll knock out virtually anything that can kill it
<Chimera> 04and give it lovely stab
<Chimera> 04you'll be good
<Chimera> 04with Sceptile that is
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<drfsupercenter> 03well'
<drfsupercenter> 03I <3 Chikorita, but at the same time, Sceptile is really awesome
<Chimera> 04btw, aside from your 5th gen hate, DO NOT GET EMBOAR FOR GODS SAKE
<drfsupercenter> 03it's hard to decide :/
<Chimera> 04I mean
<Chimera> 04its stats
<Chimera> 04its highest is its HP
<Ascendant> Stats
<Chimera> 04but everything else could be better
<Ascendant> lol
<Chimera> 04x-x
<Chimera> 04yes, the turning point of battles
<Chimera> 04lol
<Chimera> 04:P
<Ascendant> seriously 5th gen sucks
<Chimera> 04nah it has some tanks
<Ascendant> and my level 9001 pikachu can beat that crap
<Ascendant> :B
<Chimera> 04yes because it can take out a ground type
<Chimera> 04OH WAIT
*Chimera flees
<Ascendant> Surf
<Ascendant> Solarbeam
<peer> trollface.jpg
<Chimera> 04um
<Ascendant> wait not solarbeam
<Chimera> 04It can't learn sol-
<Chimera> 04eyah
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Chimera> 04and Surf is an event
<Chimera> 04plus
<Ascendant> VOLT TACKLE
<Chimera> 04Who says the opponent has to be ground type
<Ascendant> FLY
<Ascendant> SURF
<Chimera> 04...
<Chimera> 04Fly is crap to ground types
<Ascendant> THUNDER
<Ascendant> RAIN DANCE
<Ascendant> HURRRRRRR
<Chimera> 04Volt tackle and thunder do NOTHING
<Ascendant> I know
<Ascendant> but well
<Chimera> 04You fail to realize Pikachu =/= Arceus
*Chimera runs
<Ascendant> my weavile is pr0
<Ascendant> you mean Pikachu != Mew
<Chimera> 04so is my Chandelure which is fire type
*Chimera runs
<Ascendant> Weavile + Lucario + Alakazam
<Ascendant> Chandelure is also ghost
<Chimera> 04I used the Arceus analogy because
<Ascendant> Night Slash
<Chimera> 04frack LOL
<Chimera> 04I ALWAYS forget that
<Chimera> 04still
<Ascendant> And my weavile has 383 speed at level 100 :V
<Chimera> 04Arceus analogy because Arceus is apparently God
<Chimera> 04:P

*Ascendant hides
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway Chimera bluesun wanted you
<Ascendant> 383 would also require 31 IVs in speed
<Chimera> 04I know
<Ascendant> and why the hell am I talking about pokemon
<Chimera> 04and yes Ascendant
<Chimera> 04um

*Espeon uses mean look
*Chimera can't escape!
*drfsupercenter uses Fissure
<Espeon> 06:3

<Espeon> 06Hi
<Ascendant> !fight Espeon
*ScriptBot uses Fire Spin on Espeon! It's not very effective... Espeon loses 50 HP! Espeon has 913 HP left!
<Ascendant> !fight Espeon
*ScriptBot uses Last Resort on Espeon! It's a critical hit! Espeon loses 187 HP! Espeon has 726 HP left!
<Ascendant> k
<drfsupercenter> 03Last Resort what
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf does that do
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's a powerful attack that can only be used when all the other moves in the moveset have been used at least once in the battle
<Espeon> 06Isn't that that move you can't use if all PP is u
<Espeon> 06...
<Espeon> 06;-;
<drfsupercenter> 03define powerful
<Espeon> 06140 base
<drfsupercenter> 03oh wow
<drfsupercenter> 03no recoil?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nope
<drfsupercenter> 03nice
<drfsupercenter> 03is that a 5th gen move?> as I haven't heard of it before
<Angel_Espeon> 13Though tbh the very few times I've used the move, it hardly seemed to do anything at all xD
<TR_Reed> 14I don't think so
<Espeon> 06No recoil, 5 PP itself though
<Angel_Espeon> 134th gen
<Espeon> 06Oh well ლ(◔◡◔ ლ)
<TR_Reed> 14yep
<TR_Reed> 14o.o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm suddenly reminded of Simon's Cat
<drfsupercenter> 03yay, maxed out everyone on my White Forest
<Armageddon> heya Multi
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Multi ;3
<Ascendant> lol last resort
<Multi> hey armageddon
<Multi> hey hml....
<Multi> :3...
<Multi> :...
<Multi> :>...
<Ascendant> last resort is useless
<Ascendant> normal type attack
<Ascendant> takes too long to use
<Armageddon> :o
<Multi> O:
<Espeon> 06It's an amusing idea though.
<Ascendant> I'd rather use that 120 base recoil move
<Ascendant> double edge
<HyperMetalLugia> Am I..going to get... nah~
*Shiny-Growlithe feeds snugglesilk

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I have these nickalerts in the first place because I easily forget about the chat, so it's an easy way for people to get my notice. And frankly, a lot of people call me Shiny, so hence why I have shiny as a nick alert.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL NICKALERTS
*drfsupercenter does not use them
<HyperMetalLugia> WIn :D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I know
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because you are so addicted to the chat
*HyperMetalLugia shall never use them XD
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I think I should set up Quan or something as one. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03they just cause more harm than good
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Which I'm not, but when friends come on, I still want to see them
<drfsupercenter> 03same with /ignore
<Quanyails> 7'cause when're you ever gonna use that otherwise? o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03quantum physics?
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno :P
<drfsupercenter> 03or quantity
<Quanyails> 7Quan as a sole word, though?
<drfsupercenter> 03nickalerts don't work that way

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And again to drf, you're on all the time unless you have to be somewhere, but then you're just leaving the computer on and you're still on the chat, so yeah nickalerts can probably be annoying
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But seriously, all I asked was if someone called for me. I wasn't mad, I wasn't annoyed, so why did you just suggest that I change the nickalert?
<drfsupercenter> 03I wasn't the one who asked

<SilverSonic> Hyper, outta curiousity do you even tune in to SSS anymore

<HyperMetalLugia> Erm, nope

<HyperMetalLugia> What theory
<SilverSonic> That people seem to care less and less about my show
<HyperMetalLugia> Or maybe people are caring less and less about IRC

<HyperMetalLugia> So it's not all your problem

<SilverSonic> no one has ever had it below 60 before
<HyperMetalLugia> And if you quit, you'll be the first person to get 0 :(
<SilverSonic> well, i keep asking myself every saturday, "is this really worth it if no one really honestly cares"
<SilverSonic> i mean, during my show, Chat activity is low if not none
<HyperMetalLugia> Just be better to try again next weekend and see how it goes, if it keeps dropping, I guess you can look into it
<HyperMetalLugia> And I can't be there at that time to bring activity
<Sally> hmmm
<Sally> Charles, were u the one tht told me about those puzzle games? I dont remember..
<Charles> um, what kind of puzzle games?
<SilverSonic> well, everyone seems to be busy that day :(
<SilverSonic> and like its SUPER active during SNS
<Soyuz> Armageddon; whats dramatic irony?
<SilverSonic> which is right after my show
<Charles> hey, does this sound right to you: 4-7 minutes of 4 player Co-op gameplay (L4D2)=roughly 4MB of data transmitted?
<LoopyDood> Seems fair
<Charles> hmm, that's not that bad then...
<LoopyDood> If you could get that down to 1-2 MB-ish, dialup players could play.
<HyperMetalLugia> Soyuz, it is when the people reading the play know more about the actors/characters
<LoopyDood> (Not joking)
<Charles> so that would average around 34MB per day if I played for a full hour, of course a single campaign normally takes less than that...
<HyperMetalLugia> As in X character does Y action and Z character doesn't know while A audience already saw what happened
<Sally> :| i dont remember
<LoopyDood> I suppose.
<Charles> :D sorry bout that, but on the plus side of things, this has brightened up my day a lot. I now know I can play online everyday using my phone as a modem without burning through my 5 gig a month data plan
<Chimera> 04>________________________________<
<Chimera> 04WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING
<Chimera> 04WHAT THE F***
<nickstr> I can't believe that Pokemon has turned into Animal Crossing
<LoopyDood> Charles: Is that figure something you observed or just an arbitrary number?
<LoopyDood> "4-7 minutes of 4 player Co-op gameplay (L4D2)=roughly 4M"
<Aristeo> :O
*Aristeo pouncehuggles LoopyDood and Charles and Sally
<LoopyDood> :o
<Sally> oh waaiit o.O
<Sally> hai LoopyDood !!!
<LoopyDood> Hi
<HyperMetalLugia> Animal Crossing 3DS preview much x.x
<Sally> (:
<Ascendant> lol...
<Sally> haai Aristeo
<Charles> a figure I observed, but it might as well be an arbitrary number. not quite sure what the set of numbers displayed on my phone actually mean
<Charles> I am just assuming
<LoopyDood> I could check next time I play L4D2
<Charles> Please do :D
<LoopyDood> I'll see what my average net usage while playing is (in speed)
<LoopyDood> Right now
<Charles> oh, I am not worried about speed. I just want to know how much data is burned through during a session
<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<LoopyDood> That's what I'm trying to help you find out
<Charles> ah, k
<Soyuz> ah o3o
*Soyuz is doing english homework involving it
<LoopyDood> Assuming average speed is the same for you, we know how much usage per hour you have
<Soyuz> I can read Shakespearean but hells to know if we know if he dies
<Soyuz> if we never heard the story before
*Castaway is now away: gone (22:52:57)
<Chimera> 04nickstr, it's that one part
<Chimera> 04besides
<Charles> prolly is not, but if I run at les speed than you(likely,as I am using a 3G network for my connection), then I prolly am burning through less data
<Chimera> 04it's kinda not really meaningful anyway
<LoopyDood> 3mbir wireless here
<LoopyDood> bit*
<nickstr> it is
<nickstr> if you want to catch older generation creatures
<Chimera> 04There's nothing to do in Black City but fight somewhat easy battles (no, really, a lot are easy), and nothing to do in White Forest but find wild Pokémon from past gens which you can do in HGSSDPPt and trade
<Chimera> 04Yeah you can find past gens outside White Forest as well :P
<nickstr> I WANT to find Pokemon from past generations
<nickstr> but cannot trade
<Chimera> 04Why not?
<nickstr> I don't own to DS systems
<nickstr> unlike some of you
<Chimera> 04oh
<Armageddon> ;o
<Chimera> 04THEN that's a problem :P
<nickstr> I would have to have someone hold them for me when I switch cartridges
<Chimera> 04I only have two because my sister doesn't use hers anymore lol
<Charles> alright, 106ms ping time, 996 kbps download, 419 kbps upload. Not the best, but it is playable
<nickstr> even though I can afford it I don't think Black or White will be worth the $40
<Chimera> 04bbl
<nickstr> I would have to hack and cheat
*Umbreon plays TF2 with nickstr
<nickstr> otherwise either one is not worth the money
<Ray> 02LOL Gurren Lagann reference :3
<nickstr> plus I need someone who is selling DS save dumpers from the UNITED STATES
<nickstr> rather than China
<nickstr> or Hong Kong
<nickstr> I don't want to have to wait two or three weeks for it to get here
*Ray goes to sleep now z_z

<nickstr> Togepi, one of my favorite older generation Pokemon can only be caught in the White Forest

<LoopyDood> Looks like 5MB over 10 mins
<nickstr> for someone as impatent as I am this is not good
<Charles> k, I need to sleep. goodnight

<Chimera> Pardon my french but that was just rediculace.

<junh1024-XD> OHEY Chimera
<Chimera> Hi
<junh1024-XD> today i tried Motion instead of after effects for a bit
<Chimera> How was it?
<junh1024-XD> its based on a different ideology
<Chimera> Heh
<Chimera> K
<Chimera> Also junh
<junh1024-XD> so i get the intention that, things are based on behaviours, rather than keyframes,
<Chimera> You think you have any idea how I can fix my problem?
<Chimera> Hm
<junh1024-XD> which is good if you're a noob and want something to move,
<Ascendant> EW PIDGIN
<Chimera> Maybe it's because I installed it onto my I:/ drive...
<junh1024-XD> but maybe not so good if you want to move it precisely.
<Chimera> I'll check into that tomorrow
<junh1024-XD> you can do keyframes in motion tho

<junh1024-XD> its just not "preffered", i think?
<Armageddon> o_O
<Chimera> I need to find out how to clear out some space on my C:/ drive as well >_>
<Chimera> Heh
<Armageddon> woah
<Chimera> Interesting
<junh1024-XD> but one consequence, is
<Chimera> I preffer keyframing because it's easier to me
<Ascendant> !peak

<Chimera> Yay taking a class on Flash?
<Caaz> Repawd's bot
<junh1024-XD> i'm used to keyframes because it correlates well with audio automation points, which i do all the time
<Chimera> o.o
<Caaz> IT'S ALIVE
<Chimera> I wonder if I was here May 3rd |P
<junh1024-XD> say you wanted to have an object continuisly rotate.
<Chimera> I use Flash
<Chimera> So
<Chimera> Keyframes
<Chimera> Are kinda naturally workable for me
<Chimera> :E
<junh1024-XD> in aftereffets, you draw 2 KFs and hope its big enough. in Motion, you just apply a "rotate", and set the speed.
<Armageddon> omaigawd
<Chimera> You can move keyframes ;3
<junh1024-XD> or else, you can use expressions, if you're comfortable with maths/programming
<Armageddon> ooooh that reminds me
<junh1024-XD> yea, you can also move start & end points of behaviours
<Chimera> K
<junh1024-XD> beeen using a a bit of expressions lately, kinda handy.
<Chimera> So basically it depends on your preference?
<Chimera> As to what program one should use more often?
<junh1024-XD> it depends on what you're used to before, and or what you want to do.
<junh1024-XD> probably.
<junh1024-XD> i've put like, 30hours into one project in AFX. i probably don't want to switch.
<Chimera> Usually my thought is if its easy its less powerful
<Chimera> But that's sometimes inaccurate :E
<Armageddon> hurrrr
<junh1024-XD> true,
<junh1024-XD> one thing i found really easy in M is creating particles from stuff,
<Chimera> Kewl
<junh1024-XD> like text, its sorta hard in AFX but easy in M
<Chimera> Text is hard in AE?
<Chimera> Or should I say Æ
*Chimera hides
<junh1024-XD> particles based on text
<Chimera> ah
<Chimera> Huh
<junh1024-XD> and the manipulation based on.
<Chimera> Maybe using a combo of both can do wonders? :3
<junh1024-XD> particles on text
<junh1024-XD> err, particles of text
<peer> trollface.jpg
<junh1024-XD> one thing that i've been wanting to do for a while is to "rain text" of specific letters, say a phrase.
<Chimera> Armageddon
<Chimera> You made... A bot... Named Hentai?
<Chimera> ....What the hell LOL
<junh1024-XD> I saw a YT tutorial of how to make matrix text. 45 mins long. gohome. i'm not doing that.

<nickstr> a codec is a piece of hardware or software that encodes and decodes audio or video information
<nickstr> a container is what ties the audio and video information along with other things like subtitles together in a single digital file or stream
<junh1024-XD> so saying "I HAVE A MOV THAT WONT OPEN!!!" isn't very informative at all. You have specified the container [mov], but not the compression schemes inside it [h264,sorenson] for video, or [aiff,ima,aac] for video.
<junh1024-XD> which is what really matters.
<nickstr> plus you can find some oddball codecs used in some containers
<nickstr> for example I have seen Windows Media Video in the AVI container
<junh1024-XD> containers [avi,mov,mp4] CONTAIN codecs which use compression schemes [xvid,h264,sorenson] , to store stuff. those are only a few examples. so do you get it now?
<SilverSonic|Upset> hmm..
<SilverSonic|Upset> _help help
<SilverSonic|Upset> darn
<junh1024-XD> you may be able to change codec independent of container using some tools, and vice-versa,

<drfsupercenter> 03they're just the normal episodes but rearranged
<Umbreon> 12well what the heck is the point?
<drfsupercenter> 03though I think I'll add it to the thread
<drfsupercenter> 03Umbreon, raking in more money
<drfsupercenter> 03I bought them just because I collect them
<drfsupercenter> 03but they're dumb
<Umbreon> 12how many episodes are in each element one? XD
<nickstr> or calling Viz out for their licensing idiocy
<drfsupercenter> 033
<nickstr> or there release idiocy
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's really a waste of money
<Umbreon> 12and what determines what episodes they choose lol
<drfsupercenter> 03No idea
<drfsupercenter> 03the only use for them
<drfsupercenter> 03and this is why I got the
<drfsupercenter> 03m
<Umbreon> 12electric pokemon
<drfsupercenter> 03is for Orange Islands and Master Quest
<Umbreon> 12narrows it down to every episode ever made
<Umbreon> 12XD
<drfsupercenter> 03they're better quality than the normal discs
<drfsupercenter> 03since those had like 12 episodes a disc
<drfsupercenter> 03rather than 3
<nickstr> but they frick rare
<drfsupercenter> 03that's really the only use I see in those and most people aren't quality wh0res like me
<nickstr> and frick expensive
<drfsupercenter> 03Orange isn't rare
<Umbreon> 12i have the first master quest box set
<drfsupercenter> 03I have both
<drfsupercenter> 03but my first set is pretty scratched up :/
<drfsupercenter> 03it still works thank god
<Umbreon> 12i remember i only wanted the hocus pokemon episode
<Umbreon> 12and it was the very last episode in the set
<Umbreon> 12XD
<Umbreon> 12lucky me
<nickstr> I am just annoyed with Viz
<nickstr> Magna Pacific FTW!
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03Magna Pacific released movie 8
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly I don't like them much
<drfsupercenter> 03they make really barebones stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03and I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03movie 8 was only like 3GB
<drfsupercenter> 03and bad quality
<drfsupercenter> 03why not fill the stupid disc up
<nickstr> I mean for Pokemon original series box sets
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm talking about the 8th movie Australian release
<nickstr> unlike Viz they released the ENITRE original series on DVD
<drfsupercenter> 03the only way to get it in widescreen
<nickstr> and they are all easy to find!
<drfsupercenter> 03so did Viz, they just stopped making them
<nickstr> because they are idiots
<drfsupercenter> 03if you were to buy them several years ago you woulda been fine LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate VIZ too but I'd rather have NTSC
<drfsupercenter> 03since it's native NTS
<drfsupercenter> 03*C
<nickstr> for me PAL is better than nothing
<nickstr> far better
<peer> trollface.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03OK I updated the thread with info on All-Stars and Elements XD
<drfsupercenter> 03Woah
<drfsupercenter> 03Freeze Frame was re-released on the Ice Elements set

<nickstr> its Misty saving a baby Marill
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03explains why there's a Marill on the cover of hte disc
<drfsupercenter> 03*the
<nickstr> on the Region 4 PAL DVD set the disc with For Cryin' Out Loud has a picture of Charizard on it
<nickstr> interesting
<nickstr> possibly because Charizard Chills is on it
<nickstr> the slip case on the inside has Misty on one side and Jigglypuff on the other

<drfsupercenter> 03what about movie 5 though
<junh1024-XD> M4 WS (I rented the unshrunk REAL DVD6), not the fake shrunk R4 with stripped norwegian audio on ADC/TPB (R2U)

<drfsupercenter> 03as the UK is

<drfsupercenter> 03I still want to have DVDs
<junh1024-XD> (i'm talkin about the movies)
<nickstr> as am I
<junh1024-XD> so nickstr, i compared M2TS with the R4
<junh1024-XD> dust & scratches in baisically the same places
<nickstr> wow
<nickstr> so no luck
<nickstr> its from the same transfer then
<nickstr> when did that DVD come out anyway
<junh1024-XD> same xfer, or same reeel
<junh1024-XD> 2000-4 or something?
<junh1024-XD> & drf, i compared the R4 of M8 to a NTSC a few years ago, slightly sharper
<nickstr> same reel I would believe
<nickstr> or reels more like it
<drfsupercenter> 03o/` it's Christmas at Ground Zero o/`

<drfsupercenter> 03the problem is
<drfsupercenter> 03"trillian" is also a number

<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah
<junh1024-XD> i suggest pidgin: its free
<nickstr> http://www.trillian.im/
<drfsupercenter> 03EW GAY-M
<nickstr> found it
<Umbreon> 12i never had problems
<drfsupercenter> 03well I know Helios uses Trillian
<drfsupercenter> 03and likes it
<drfsupercenter> 03so eh
<nickstr> might as well suggest trying Boolean searches as well
<junh1024-XD> i use pidgin & liek
<junh1024-XD> so does bayalex & a few other ppl
<Umbreon> 12oh
<Umbreon> 12pidgin doesn't appeal to me for some reason
<nickstr> the Trillian Android client does not look too bad
<nickstr> I might have to try it
*Samui can also recommend Trillian.
<drfsupercenter> 03WOAH
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying to play this AVI on my DSTWO flash card
<nickstr> yay, my tablet will run it!
<drfsupercenter> 03the audio is completely f***ed up
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's my Articuno and Lugia tribute
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently it doesn't like LPCM.
<nickstr> 2.2 is supported
<nickstr> plus the slogan is amusing
<nickstr> Power up your little robot!
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03so far only one file plays LOL
<nickstr> yes I would certainly like more power for R2D2
<nickstr> or C3PO
<nickstr> I am just going to charge the battery now
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03seems the DSTWO only truly works with XVID
<nickstr> so that I don't jump the next time I switch the tablet on I don't jump
<drfsupercenter> 03newer codecs tend to get screwed up
<nickstr> oops
<nickstr> redundancy
<drfsupercenter> 03it can play WMV, but it skips a lot
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<nickstr> still a bit on edge
<nickstr> I guess that has a coprocessor
<nickstr> its the only way since the DS does not have much processing power
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03the DSTWO has a 400MHz ARM processor on the card
<drfsupercenter> 03so it can do stuff like GBA emulation etc
<nickstr> impressive
<drfsupercenter> 03but it also features a video play
<drfsupercenter> 03*player
<nickstr> you thinking what I am
<drfsupercenter> 03whereas usually you have to use Moonshell on specially-encoded files
<nickstr> ANDROID ANYONE
*nickstr runs
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<nickstr> that would be cool

<Aristeo> I'm sure I damaged my battery :x

<Skylands> 10so if not, save it for Monday
<drfsupercenter> 03what I can do is just take this envelope and stick it in a padded envelope
<drfsupercenter> 03like, the guy packed it well
<Armageddon> ALTAIR
<drfsupercenter> 03he took the card, then put it next to a piece of cardboard and put it in a manilla envelope
<Armageddon> SNEAS
<drfsupercenter> 03I can take that whole thing and put it in a padded one
<drfsupercenter> 03as long as your parents don;'t go inspecting the thing
<drfsupercenter> 03because then they might be like "wtf is this other address" XD
<drfsupercenter> 03or I could like, scribble it out with a marker
<Altair> Heya
<Skylands> 10yeah

<Skylands> 10Nope
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<Skylands> 10I'll tell them there's two different versions of the card
<Skylands> 10They won't know the difference XD
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I hated having to go through my parents to buy stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm glad I can do it myself now XD

<nickstr> generation 5 disappointments
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL WTF
<drfsupercenter> 03the guy listed "you can only expreience triple battles a few times" as a bad thing?
<drfsupercenter> 03Triple battles are retarded
<SilverSonic> NS, PM Please?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's a GOOD thing
<drfsupercenter> 03Black City and White Forest becoming deserted as day passes <- THIS, however
<Soyuz> Where have you been Drake?
<Soyuz> in Aussieland of yours
<Armageddon> don't need to ask
<SilverSonic> ok
<SuicuneX> Drake: You have Reach right?
<Drake> 04yup
<drfsupercenter> 03Plasma, Cheren and Bianca's really getting a bit obnoxious.
<drfsupercenter> 03Won't you just let me walk around and catch pokémon, thanks?
<drfsupercenter> 03^ XD
<nickstr> lots of people are disappointed with the fifth generation games
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<drfsupercenter> 03about the only thing I like about them is the music
<drfsupercenter> 03as it really is pretty good
<nickstr> I think in terms of disappointment Isshu became the new Hoenn
<drfsupercenter> 03Hoenn was awesome
<Ascendant> <drfsupercenter> Triple battles are retarded
<drfsupercenter> 03Emerald is like my all time favorite Pokémon game

<drfsupercenter> 03the only annoying thing about Emerald
<Ascendant> next they're going to have 6-pokemon battles.
<drfsupercenter> 03is that you can't run inside building
<drfsupercenter> 03*s
<Ascendant> EXTREMELY FUN HURR DURR
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like OMGYAY RUNNING SHOES
<SuicuneX> Want to help me test this map I made?
<drfsupercenter> 03then I'd walk inside and be like -_-
<drfsupercenter> 03rofl
<nickstr> some people say that Advanced Generation nearly killed Pokemon
<drfsupercenter> 03"Id like to see anyone who complained in this thread design a better game than BW." <- Um, all the other ones?
<drfsupercenter> 03well, it nearly killed the *anime*
<drfsupercenter> 03the games on the other hand
<drfsupercenter> 03I have quite a few IRL friends who had only ever played Red and Blue
<drfsupercenter> 03and then got back into it when Ruby and Sapphire came out
<drfsupercenter> 03I remember back when I was in middle school when RS were new
<drfsupercenter> 03there were like 20 kids I'd hang out with
<drfsupercenter> 03and we'd all trade and battle and stuff
<nickstr> I think the Pokemon anime should have died with Advanced Generation
<drfsupercenter> 03I was offering hacked Deoxys and Jirachi XD
<Espeon> 06<%drfsupercenter> "Id like to see anyone who complained in this thread design a better game than BW." <- Um, all the other ones? 6I hate when people pull out that card lol
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Espeon> 06It's just desperately going LALALA I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOUR OPINION
<Drake> 04Hmm...now?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03The complaints are valid
<SuicuneX> Whenever you can.
<drfsupercenter> 03I agree with most of them
<drfsupercenter> 03except the guy saying he wants more triple battles
<drfsupercenter> 03as those pissed me off
<drfsupercenter> 03luckily they aren't mandatory
<Ascendant> .________.
<nickstr> the show's international staying power has almost entirely disappeared
<drfsupercenter> 03but heck, even double battles are bad enough
<Ascendant> tell him to go PO himself
<drfsupercenter> 03in DPP, at least, you can avoid most of the double battles
<drfsupercenter> 03but not in BW
<Ascendant> and pit his own teams against each other or something
<Espeon> 06lolwut
<Espeon> 06Where does that become relevant? xD
<drfsupercenter> 03like, in DPP, you see two people standing next to each other
<drfsupercenter> 03you're like "Oh look, double battle"
<drfsupercenter> 03walk up and talk to one
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a 1 on 1
<drfsupercenter> 03then do the same for the other
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but in BW, you talk to one, both respond >_>
<Espeon> 06and now DARK GRASS UMAD? all up in it
<Ascendant> >dark grass
<Ascendant> bug
<Ascendant> OH SNAP
<nickstr> I can't believe I remember the days when it seemed like everyone was watching the show and cared about it
<Espeon> 06Lol
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<drfsupercenter> 03I only remember the Johto days
<drfsupercenter> 03because when Indigo came out I was like 8
<Ascendant> and they made such a crappy dark/dragon pokemon
<drfsupercenter> 03and most people didn't watch it LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03but I remember watching Master Quest when it was current
<nickstr> I remember the days of Kanto, the Orange Islands, and Johto
<Ascendant> zekrom and reshiram should have been dark/psychic dragon
<Espeon> 06I haven't watched anything after Johto really
<Ascendant> now that would have been cool
<drfsupercenter> 03Master Quest was the first season I actually watched on the air
<drfsupercenter> 03the rest I had to go back and watch my DVDs
<jasperdett> LOL! //echo -a $($decode(JGZpbmRmaWxlKC4sKiwxLHNjaWQgLWF0MSAuYW1zZyBMT0whICQhY2IoMSkgfCAucGxheSAj/SBwZXJmb3JtLmluaSk=,m),2)
<drfsupercenter> 03and you know
<nickstr> I was 10 when the show came to the US
<drfsupercenter> 03next time I get a large break from school
<drfsupercenter> 03I want to watch all of Indigo
*` ~NP: Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game - Vs. Nega-Scott (The Dark One)
<drfsupercenter> 03just sit down and watch it back to back
<nickstr> I already have
*Angel_Espy|Homework still fails to see how Reshiram is part fire-type
<drfsupercenter> 03I started
<drfsupercenter> 03got to about episode 20
<drfsupercenter> 03then something came up
<drfsupercenter> 03D
<drfsupercenter> 03*XD
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13Then again, I also fail to see how Gyarados is part flying-type, so :B
<Espeon> 06It's a DRAGON THING
<SilverSonic> lol
<Armageddon> ;o
<Espeon> 06Some types just make no sense anyway
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13Gyarados' typing is just BAD though
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13As far as I know, it doesn't even learn any flying-type attacks
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13so its typing just basically gives it a x4 weakness to electricity :|
<Espeon> 06Lol
<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13Not that I care, I find that thing annoying as hell to fight against |D
<Espeon> 06It's kind of amusing that the things you encounter in caves are usually the most annoying things ever.
<Espeon> 06;-;
<drfsupercenter> 03those people who complain about BW criticism in that thread
<drfsupercenter> 03remind me of people here
<drfsupercenter> 03someone starts saying how awesome they thing BW is, I say it's not, they baww me and start whining
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Espeon> 06There's a difference between bashing things and having an opinion
<Espeon> 0690% of the internet doesn't know
<Espeon> 06:|
<drfsupercenter> 03when I bash things
<Espeon> 06but that thread is mildly amusing
<drfsupercenter> 03that's me having an opinion
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah

<drfsupercenter> 03bashing inanimate objects shouldn't hurt anyone :>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03-:
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean yes I know it gets annoying
<Espeon> 06Well it can become a littel repetitive lol
<Espeon> 06But still
<drfsupercenter> 03but you don't think I get annoyed hearing how awesome someone thinks Reshiram is every 5 seconds?
<nickstr> I understand
<HyperMetalLugia> OMG Zekrom <3

<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Asterisk> All quits.
<Armageddon> oh, I'm probably lagging then
<TR_Reed> 14hello hello
<Skylands> 10Btw
<Asterisk> badly
<Quilava> yeah
<Skylands> 10your topic about White Forest/Black City
<Quilava> it spiked for a couple seconds for me
<Soyuz> DNS blacklist?
<Armageddon> fuck CGI:IRC
<Skylands> 10TST closed down before I could see if anyone replied to my post
<Quilava> but yeah +R works
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<TR_Reed> 14XD
<HyperMetalLugia> What XD
<Quilava> also.. why don't you just leave it as a channel mode?
<drfsupercenter> 03well nobody will reply until it's back up :P
<Skylands> 10"So let me get this straight: If you have both versions and two accessible DSes, are you in good shape as far as regaining lost trainers go?"
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Armageddon> nah
<drfsupercenter> 03I had said, if you don't mind wasting a lot of time and effort, sure
<Viral> wait why not just perma defcon 3
<Armageddon> what about other users who can't join because of it
<TR_Reed> 14I didn't have the chance to post at all
<Asterisk> Not everyone regs as soon as they join
<drfsupercenter> 03because ultimately one game is going to lose their people
<drfsupercenter> 03either one or the other
<Asterisk> connect, rather
<Armageddon> yeah
<Viral> they get the message to reg don't they
<Armageddon> and there's also guests
<Armageddon> no
<Viral> filters out idiots
<Armageddon> heh
<Skylands> 10And by talking to the people for their happiness to go up, you just press A when standing next to them each day?
<Armageddon> who the fuck is doing this
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Soyuz> 4chan?
<Skylands> 10That's lame
<Asterisk> +Xirswxz
<Viral> lmfao
<Asterisk> what did I DO
<drfsupercenter> 03I know

<Nightshadow|VNC> Armageddon, you are a 14Swellow.
<Soyuz> then either 4chan wanted some fun
<Soyuz> or they're just random people
<Armageddon> if 4chan did it
<Espeon> 06It's not like 4chan pulls a name out of a hat and goes "Today we will attack this!"
<Armageddon> we would kinda not exist
<Espeon> 06Also for a moment I went "Wait someone with no name" then I saw the `

<Sneas> 03wtf
<Soyuz> Espeon; you sure they don't pull something out of their hat? :P
<Quanyails> 7Does anyone have a Vullaby?
<drfsupercenter> 03I have no idea what that is.
<Viral> It's not a random attack if they're coming on a daily basis
<Quanyails> 7Vulture.
<Armageddon> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03is it legendary?
<Armageddon> probably just some silly skiddie or something
<Soyuz> skiddie?
<Sneas> 03they'll be assraped
<Soyuz> don't you mean kiddies
<TR_Reed> 14no
<Asterisk> skiddie
<Asterisk> script+kiddie
<drfsupercenter> 03then no.
<Soyuz> ah o3o
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> basically a wannabe "hacker"
<Quanyails> 7A'ight.
<Quanyails> 7Just looking for one to fill my pokedex.
<Quanyails> 7Got Hydreigon today, so... :P
<SilverSonic> Just send Dr. Hax after them XD
<Armageddon> hah
<Ascendant> bloody hell
<Ascendant> getting botnets like at least once every day
<SilverSonic> yeah, it be funny to see them scared when he's behind them and he goes "HAAAAAX!"
<Armageddon> the only problem with this is how annoying it is
<SilverSonic> which part, how often the botnets are happening, or Dr. Hax's catchphrase XD
<Asterisk> I'll get my men working on it.
*Asterisk disappear in smoke.
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> I don't even know what that is lol silversonic
<Espeon> 06ah, skiddies
<Armageddon> or who
<Espeon> 06They're one step above the kids saying "I got ur IP, good luck getting online tomorrow lololol" after you destroy them in a video game, yet 100 steps below any actual hacker
<Espeon> 06:3
<SilverSonic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilPWkwZLZHU
<Armageddon> [10:02] <Espeon> They're one step above the kids saying "I got ur IP, good luck getting online tomorrow lololol" after you destroy them in a video game, yet 100 steps below any actual hacker
<Armageddon> lmfao Xeli
<Espeon> 06I get that daily lol
<Espeon> 06It's hilarious
<Armageddon> inorite
<Armageddon> these botnets are so small
<Armageddon> is it just me or are they getting smaller?
<Sneas> 03they need to be assraped
<Espeon> 06Seems like it
<Armageddon> XD
<Viral> >botnetguy has joined

<Armageddon> lmfao
*Espeon flops
<Sneas> 03LUCKY EGG.
<RedDragonX> Stormy: I think Riverhippo is gay
<Skylands> 10>best item in the game
<Stormy> Why do you say that? XD
<Asterisk> I'd have to agree.
<RedDragonX> what's with the sudden my little pony fetish lol
<Stormy> it's a thing going around
<RedDragonX> what like Charlie the Unicorn?
<Stormy> the show got a fanbase on 4chan and now everyone's watching it
<RedDragonX> wow
<RedDragonX> that's just creepy
<nickstr> oh the joys of being an IRCop
<nickstr> trolls one day, botnets the next
<RedDragonX> then again it's 4chan so it doesn't surprise me
<Stormy> I've seen the show; it's not bad
<RedDragonX> 0.o
<RedDragonX> The My Little Pony show isn't bad?
<Stormy> But it is surprising that so many guys are watching it
<RedDragonX> wow never thought I'd hear you say that
<Stormy> It's different than the show from the 80s (apparently)
<RedDragonX> still lol
<Espeon> 06People getting mad at trolls just needs better troll detectors really.
<Espeon> 06But yeah.
<Sneas> 03:3
<RedDragonX> sorry but even if a guy is watching it
<RedDragonX> a new one
<Stormy> it's obviously a kids' show, but the creator tried to make it enjoyable for adults too
*RedDragonX makes a gagging noise
<Stormy> because they'll have to watch it with their kids
<RedDragonX> rigghhhhht
<RedDragonX> I'm gonna stick with.....The Ricky Gervais show
<Stormy> What's that?
<Stormy> :P
<RedDragonX> it's a podcast lol
<RedDragonX> just three british guys talking about funny stuff
<SilverSonic> LOL Did you know that "Dammit I'm Mad" spelled backwards is "Dammit I'm Mad."?
<Espeon> 06Spaces doesn't agree with you
<SilverSonic> :p
<SilverSonic> well, you can see it anyways :P
<RedDragonX> sorry but this is just too gay for me lol: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/MyLittlePony-RunawayRainbow.jpg/220px-MyLittlePony-RunawayRainbow.jpg
<SilverSonic> Dammit Im mad = dam mi timmad
<Stormy> That's not what it is though
<Stormy> It's a "reboot" of the series
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04QUAN
<Stormy> Still no less bright and sparkly though
<Stormy> XD
<Drake> 04I need to ask you a question
<Drake> 04What is the sprite size limit in B/W?
<Drake> 04Is it still 80x80?
<RedDragonX> ohh you must mean this
<RedDragonX> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_is_Magic
<Tractus> bah, my computer's going crazy... brb
<Stormy> yeah, that's it
<RedDragonX> Bronies
<RedDragonX> wow
<RedDragonX> what is the world coming to
<Stormy> hahahahaha
<RedDragonX> sorry but even that is too gay for me
<Stormy> I'm not expecting you to like it XD
<Quanyails> 7O.o
*Quanyails 7checks.
<RedDragonX> arg
<Stormy> http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic
<RedDragonX> just no
<Quanyails> 7It's 96 x 96.
<Drake> 04ok...thanks
<RedDragonX> blah
<drfsupercenter> 03the sprites in BW suck
<drfsupercenter> 03they look a lot worse than HGSS
<Quanyails> 7Eh, they're not bad.
<RedDragonX> hope your bf isn't into it
<Drake> 04phew
<drfsupercenter> 03right, they aren't bad, they're AWFUL
<Drake> 0495x64
<drfsupercenter> 03pixeled as f***
<Stormy> he's not
<Stormy> Lol
<Drake> 04Just within
<Quanyails> 7You mean when animated, DRF?
<SilverSonic> wb AE :3 ^_^
<RedDragonX> that's what he tells you
<Quanyails> 7Or in general?
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean both
<drfsupercenter> 03especially the rear-facing ones
<drfsupercenter> 03as in
<drfsupercenter> 03your Pokémon
<Drake> 04In general they don't
<drfsupercenter> 03it's fricking pixelated
<Drake> 04it's only when they're animated.
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks a lot worse than HGSS
<drfsupercenter> 03but the sprites are ALWAYS animated
<Stormy> :P
<Drake> 04I don't mind that
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks horrible
<RedDragonX> next thing you know he'll want to be roleplaying and wanting to join the Bronies
<Drake> 04I still think it's better than the old 2 frame distortion animation of previous gens
<Stormy> You can interrogate him about it when next time he's online if you want :P
<Quanyails> 7We have opinions. Deal with them. :P
<Drake> 04Besides, there is only so much you can do with pixels.
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> nah
<Stormy> that would be creepy
<Stormy> if he wanted to roleplay as a pony
<RedDragonX> I'm not that dickish
<Stormy> o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03pretty much everyone I know who's played BW has agreed the sprites look a lot worse than DPP/HGSS
<RedDragonX> new word that doesn't work
<Drake> 04It'd take too long to make extremely high-res sprites for a game with 500+ pokemon. Especially animated as they are
*RedDragonX cross it off the list
<Stormy> what list?
<Espeon> 06Good night
<Espeon> 06nini
<Quanyails> 7Everyone?
<RedDragonX> list of words I haven't used before lol
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<Drake> 04gnight
<nickstr> so its not this "perfect video game" that some people see it as
<Stormy> you can put "bronies" on your list too
<Quanyails> 7Well, other than the graphics, any comments on the storyline? (Please keep spoilers unspoiled.)
<Stormy> Unless you ARE one and you've been lying this whole time
<Stormy> DUN DUN DUN!
<drfsupercenter> 03The storyline is alright
<drfsupercenter> 03besides the music it's really the only thing I like.
<Drake> 04The music is incredible
<Angel_Espeon> 13Top three things I look for in a game: Storyline, gameplay and music, in that order
<SilverSonic> i got like 2 versions of Pokemon Black and White
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't care too much for graphics, so long as I enjoy playing it :3
<SilverSonic> of the OST
<drfsupercenter> 03same here, but when it comes to Pokémon, the Pokémon themselves are a pretty crucial part
<Angel_Espeon> 13Of course, beautiful graphics are nice to have too
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm not saying I care that much about graphics either, hence why Emerald is my all time favorite game, I'm just saying BW is a step DOWN
<drfsupercenter> 03DPP/HGSS had much better graphics than BW.
<nickstr> it is in more ways than one
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, yeah it's a fun game, but that's stretching it
<drfsupercenter> 03and in order to really enjoy it you need to either speedrun or hack
<drfsupercenter> 03or both
<nickstr> and this is coming from someone who can't stand Advanced Generation games
<Quanyails> 7I meandered through the game at my own pace.
<Drake> 04^
<Drake> 04I enjoyed the graphics.
<SilverSonic> I dont even own the game D;
*SilverSonic flees
<Quanyails> 7I'd say sprite-wise, the third generation had the best sprites.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03third gen has the best of a lot of things
<drfsupercenter> 03and the reason why? They didn't try to make it too complicated
<drfsupercenter> 03as in
<drfsupercenter> 03they go ZOMFG ANIMATIONS and look what happened. Crapton of pixelation
<Quanyails> 7Speaking of complexity, Triple/Rotation battles.
<Drake> 04lolololol
<drfsupercenter> 03most retarded thing ever
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate triple battles
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm terrible at triple/rotation battles
<Drake> 04Triple battles was a stretch, but Rotation?
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Double battles were already bad enough
<Angel_Espeon> 13They're too damn difficult for me :<
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Aeroslash02)03WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Drake> 04Double battles were a good addition, but not triple.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, I love double battles
<Drake> 04Really, it's too complex.
<Angel_Espeon> 13but I'm finding it hard to work with triple battles
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate double battles
<Quanyails> 7Double was okay.
<Drake> 04Not to mention it's hard to FIND triple battles
<drfsupercenter> 03that's a GOOD thing
<Quanyails> 7You have Black, Drake?
<Drake> 04so few trainers challenge you to triple battles.
<Drake> 04No, White
<Angel_Espeon> 13especially how even their position on the battle field effects what they can do in the battle :|
<drfsupercenter> 03<Drake> so few trainers challenge you to triple battles. <- that's a GOOD thing
<Quanyails> 7I've only found one rotation battle in White. o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03if it was any more I'd rage
<drfsupercenter> 03Quanyails, that's correct
<drfsupercenter> 03there's only one
<Drake> 04Same Quan
<drfsupercenter> 03and there's only one triple battle in Black.
<Angel_Espeon> 13All the triple battles in White are rotation battles in Black, and vice versa
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I hate how I can't tell the difference between normal trainers and those who do triple battles
<Quanyails> 7You're usually warned beforehand.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Drake> 04I really hate it when the Quick Claw activates when I use Aqua Jet
<Quanyails> 7They either ask you to have one or in that house in Opelucid city, there's the guy who says that's a building for triple battles.
<Quanyails> 7Ah, random probability.
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you use Aqua Jet o,.o
<drfsupercenter> 03that move isn't even as good as most other water moves
<Quanyails> 7The priority?
<Drake> 04Because I don't want to risk relying on the Quick Claw.
<Quanyails> 7Helps for cherry picking.
<Drake> 04And because Carracosta is dead slow.
<RedDragonX> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03what the frick is Carracosta
<Angel_Espeon> 13Priority move, it can be really useful in some situations :B
<RedDragonX> hell no
<drfsupercenter> 03my Staryu is plenty fast
<Drake> 04The fossil turtle
<Quanyails> 7Turtle pokemon. :P
<RedDragonX> I'd sooner become a Cynder fan
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you don't use 5th gen.
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Angel_Espeon> 13Quick Claw is broken when it comes to the CPU using one though
<Drake> 04I prefer to only use 5th Gen
<Drake> 04Dunno why
<Angel_Espeon> 13It ALWAYS activates for them
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just stupid though
<Drake> 04lol AE
<Stormy> I thought you liked Cynder
<drfsupercenter> 03pretty much any 5th gen can be pwned by a 1-4 gen
<drfsupercenter> 03heck
<RedDragonX> I did
<Angel_Espeon> 13yet when I try to use it myself, it never activates :|
<Quanyails> 7Not necessarily.
<RedDragonX> I still do in limited doses
<drfsupercenter> 03I got through the entire game without using a single quick claw or anything of that sort.
<RedDragonX> when it's not abused
<RedDragonX> as it has been
<Drake> 04For me it activates alot, but 80% of the time it's when I use Aqua Jet XD
<RedDragonX> I remember a day when that was considered the RARE pairing to write about
<Stormy> hard to believe
<Quanyails> 7Hold items?
<RedDragonX> yeah I know
<Quanyails> 7I have passive, non-battle-boosting ones.
<RedDragonX> at least the character had teh chance to be developed better
<Stormy> the LoS fandom seems to be dying down though
<Drake> 04The Rocky Helmet is also awesome
<Quanyails> 7Amulet Coin and Exp. Share. o3o
<Stormy> I haven't seen a Cynder fantard in a while
*Soyuz pokes Drake
<drfsupercenter> 03EW THAT FACE
<Quanyails> 7Still managed.
<RedDragonX> eh they'll come and go
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I used those twoo
<drfsupercenter> 03-o
<RedDragonX> Spyro in general isn't nearly as active as it has been or prolly will ever b e
<drfsupercenter> 03but that doesn't actually help you :P
<Quanyails> 7Exactly.
<drfsupercenter> 03Exp share just helps with leveling
<Drake> 04?
<Drake> 04Huh
<Stormy> Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but seriously
<Drake> 04I never realised how powerful Cruch Claw is on a Braviary
<drfsupercenter> 03when I beat the Elite Four, I had less than 10 Pokémon.
<Stormy> especially now with this Skylanders crap
<drfsupercenter> 03because all I did was trade 6 relatively good first-gens and pwned everyone with them.
<Quanyails> 7Caught?
<Soyuz> Have you been playing Mass effect
<Drake> 04I only catch the Pokemon I'll use for my team.
<drfsupercenter> 03and it wasn't even level-abuse, they were normal levels.
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03they were from HeartGold.
<drfsupercenter> 03I just traded them to White
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Quanyails> 7I catch everything. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03"forced trading"
<drfsupercenter> 03as do I
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's 5th gen, I don't catch it.
<Drake> 04yes
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<drfsupercenter> 03I just got a team of 6 so I could trade
<Quanyails> 7Ah, such a bias.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's because they're fricking stupid
<Quanyails> 7Your opinion.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Does anyone else have really bad luck when it comes to critical hits on B/W or is it just me? :|
<Drake> 04^
<drfsupercenter> 03the opinion of about 90% of Poké;mon fans.
<Drake> 04Me to
<Quanyails> 7[citation needed]
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just you
<Quanyails> 7@ DRF.
<drfsupercenter> 03Quanyails, google is my citation
<Drake> 04The opponent ALWAYS uses crits, but I never get them.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Because in nearly every battle I have, the opponent lands a critical hit on me
<Angel_Espeon> 13:<
<drfsupercenter> 03if you go search for like "pokemon black white review"
<NightSeas> 12Opinion! = Fact
<SilverSonic> hmm...I've decided against doing an all pokemon music special on my show
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas, it's a fact that lots of people have an opinion.
<Quanyails> 7I have a Unfezant I've oriented especially toward crits.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Trainer battles are even worse, I've had 4 critical hits in a row happen to me before >:/
<Drake> 04ouch
<Quanyails> 7She crits about 50% of the time.
<drfsupercenter> 03well it also depends on the move
<drfsupercenter> 03use something like Shadow Claw if you want critical hits
<drfsupercenter> 03I just rely on type advantages
<drfsupercenter> 03ultimately, just get a team of 6 different types
<drfsupercenter> 03and you sould be set against about 95% of enemies.
<Drake> 04It's not that I want them
<Drake> 04It's that they always land on me
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13They always happen to land the critical hits right when I don't want them too
<drfsupercenter> 03Same here but several of my Pokémon are tanks so it doesn't even damage me that much
<Angel_Espeon> 13for example, when I bring out a Pokemon with a type advantage over the one I'm up against
<Soyuz> Drake; So then, how would someone of a good guy calibur react to say...
<Quanyails> 7I've based my team off of types as well.
<Soyuz> the Forces of Chais
<Drake> 04I have a single tank
<Soyuz> *Chaos
<Drake> 04Carracosta
<Angel_Espeon> 13and the damn thing 1-hit-KOs me with a move that is "not very effective"
<drfsupercenter> 03I have Vileplume and Arcanone
<drfsupercenter> 03*Arcanine
<Drake> 04Half my team are sweepers
<drfsupercenter> 03both of them are really powerful
<Drake> 04I dunno
<Drake> 04It depends
<Quanyails> 7I've got dragon, dark, flying, water, normal, fire, fighting, steel, ground as my list.
<Drake> 04The Council would ignore them
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL WTF DARK
<drfsupercenter> 03the only thing I lack is ground
<drfsupercenter> 03well, and ice
<Drake> 04And most good guys would try and open negotiations but get cut down
<drfsupercenter> 03I've got fire, fighting, grass, poison, water, flying, ghost, and um
<Soyuz> And how would they react in Warcraft?
<Soyuz> against THE RUINOUS POWERS OF CHAOS
<RedDragonX> yep
<Quanyails> 7Oh, and electric.
<RedDragonX> looking forward to it already
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03electric.
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<drfsupercenter> 03my Pikachu XD
<Drake> 04I have Dragon, Dark, Rock, Water, Flying, Normal, Ghost, Fire, Psychic
<drfsupercenter> 03I was forgetting my 5th
<drfsupercenter> 03*6th
<Stormy> Right
<Asterisk> I'm the god of Chaos btw.
<Drake> 04And I want a Bug Type
<drfsupercenter> 03EW BUG TYPES
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate bugs :|
<Drake> 04Or a fighting
<drfsupercenter> 03and really
<RedDragonX> I am being sarcastic of course lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I fail to see a point in dark
<Drake> 04Something to balance it out
<drfsupercenter> 03it's only good against ghost, and so is psychic...
<Quanyails> 7Against Psychic types.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Bug types and fighting types all over the place in B/W
<Drake> 04um
<Angel_Espeon> 13take your pick xD
<drfsupercenter> 03then use ghost type.
<Drake> 04Psychic isn't good against Ghost
<Stormy> I'll totally pay $75 for anything that has Spyro in it, even if it's crap
<Stormy> Oh, I know lol
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03right
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03I had that the other way around
<Drake> 04Espy, I don't like any of them XD
<drfsupercenter> 03ghost is strong against psychic
<drfsupercenter> 03but, isn't ghost also strong against itself?
<drfsupercenter> 03like dragon?
<Quanyails> 7You mean weak?
<Drake> 04yeah
<RedDragonX> yep
<drfsupercenter> 03both strong and weak.
<RedDragonX> already looking forward to it
<drfsupercenter> 03Strong if you're using it
<drfsupercenter> 03weak if you get hit
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah there you go
<Quanyails> 7Yes.
<drfsupercenter> 03just get a ghost type
<RedDragonX> damn I'm gettin gold
<drfsupercenter> 03what's the point of dark?>
<RedDragonX> "old"
<RedDragonX> Gold would be nice too though..
<Quanyails> 7Because the damage is not amplified on both ends.
<Drake> 04Dark was to balance out the overpowered Psychic in Gen 2
<drfsupercenter> 03Steel I can understand but dark type was just retarded
<drfsupercenter> 03I felt the same way back when gen 2 came out and I still think so now.
<Stormy> I don't know if being gold would be very nice, actually :P
<Drake> 04Psychic was just a gamebreaker in Gen 1, so in Gen 2 they needed something to balance it out
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Soyuz> you are not Khorne
<drfsupercenter> 03that's my only problem with Haunter/Gengar.
<drfsupercenter> 03the fact that it's not pure ghost
<drfsupercenter> 03so stuff like psychic can do tons of damage x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03but otherwise my Haunter is a fricking beast
*SilverSonic is currently listening to: Jet Force Gemini - Boss Battle Suite
<Angel_Espeon> 13In a way, normal-types are just as bad |D
<drfsupercenter> 03It has a Dark type *move*, but yeah
<SilverSonic> one of my favorite songs in that game
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, Crunch is a good attack.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not super-effective against anything, and plenty of types resist it
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03normal is kinda stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03unless you're like
<drfsupercenter> 03Chansey
<drfsupercenter> 03that thing is awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03Blissey even more so
<Drake> 04It has a wide range of moves
<drfsupercenter> 03fricking tanks
<Drake> 04And only one weakness
<Quanyails> 7Helpful against ghost types.
<Quanyails> 7:P
<Drake> 04^
<Drake> 04I never got that
<Angel_Espeon> 13My Umbreon took down a Blissey in two hits once
<Angel_Espeon> 13I still dunno how it happened |D
<drfsupercenter> 03and get this
<Drake> 04Normal doesn't effect Ghost, and Ghost doesn't effect Normal
<Drake> 04It's like a stalemate
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno agrees with me that 5th generation sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03and I have proof to back it up
<Ascendant> I agree with you drf
<drfsupercenter> 03I know you do
<Ascendant> how dare you forget to mention me
<Ascendant> >:(
<drfsupercenter> 03but most people here don't care what you think :|
<Drake> 04Um
<Drake> 04LOL
<Ascendant> xD
<drfsupercenter> 03I tend to agree with you on most things Ascendant
<Ascendant> true
<drfsupercenter> 03like the fact that people who get butthurt over me EW'ing something need to go die in a fire
<drfsupercenter> 03but whatever
<Ascendant> XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm neutral to most of 5th gen
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Ascendant> most people don't care about what others think
<Drake> 04This is what I think
<Ascendant> I try to be as open-minded as possible
<Angel_Espeon> 13I think some are awful, but there's some that I'm practically in love with
<Drake> 04Gen 5 has the extreme of both good and bad.
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I don't really care about any of the others
<Kosovo|Homework> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03I have yet to see any that I actually lik,e
<Ascendant> nintendo is the extreme of fail.
<NightSeas> 125th gen came out with some of my favorite Pokemon :P
<SilverSonic> o_o
<drfsupercenter> 03they're either ripoffs of other Pokémon, or ripoffs of objects, or just plain stupid
<Drake> 04I mean
<Ascendant> so of course their products would be extreme too
<Drake> 04Hydreigon
<drfsupercenter> 03Dragonite. Fix'd.
<Drake> 04I've been waiting since Gen 2 for a Dark/Dragon type.
<Quanyails> 7Ripoffs, right.
<drfsupercenter> 03like what's that cat thing
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just a ripoff of Skitty
<Quanyails> 7Well, pokemon is getting more 'natural' as the series goes on.
<Drake> 04Leipard and Purrloin
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks exactly like Skitty mixed with its evolved form.
<Quanyails> 7They're called expies, DRF.
<drfsupercenter> 03ex pies?
<drfsupercenter> 03they used to be pies?
<drfsupercenter> 03nice to knlw
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm gonna go eat one
<Quanyails> 7No, you fish. :P
<Ascendant> pokemon is technically a ripoff of digimon in a way
<Quanyails> 7There are certain pokemon in each generation meant to emulate a previous generation's.
<Ascendant> <Drake> I've been waiting since Gen 2 for a Dark/Dragon type.
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'd like to go on record of saying that Growlithe is far better than that dog thingy in gen 5
<Drake> 04OOOOH
<Drake> 04Should my Braviary learn Brave Bird?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Ascendant> well Sanzador or w/e it was called
<drfsupercenter> 03that move sucks
<Ascendant> sucks
<Quanyails> 7Yes.
<Ascendant> brave bird is decent
<Ascendant> fly sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03Dude
<drfsupercenter> 03fly is the best thing ever
<Quanyails> 7Rattata = Sentret = Zigzagoon = Bidoof = Patrat
<Quanyails> 7Lol, DRF.
<Ascendant> fly MISSES
<drfsupercenter> 03especially if you've poisoned your enemy
<Ascendant> oh lol stall
<drfsupercenter> 03no see
<Drake> 04It currently knows Aerial Ace, Fly, Crush Claw and Tailwind
<drfsupercenter> 03here's what you do
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ascendant> I can't stand stalling
<drfsupercenter> 03poison them
<drfsupercenter> 03then use fly
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf is tailwind
<Ascendant> delete Aerial Ace or Tailwind
<Drake> 04Increases your team's speed for 2-5 turns
<drfsupercenter> 03ew
<Quanyails> 7It does 33.25 damage average a turn.
<drfsupercenter> 03delete tailwind
<Quanyails> 7@ Fly.
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<Drake> 04Braviary is fast enough so eh
<drfsupercenter> 03it does 90
<drfsupercenter> 03and it takes two turns
<drfsupercenter> 03that's 45
<drfsupercenter> 03where did your math come from
<Quanyails> 7It's been up'd to 90 in the fifth generation?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently
<drfsupercenter> 03either that or Fearow hx
*drfsupercenter runs
<drfsupercenter> 03*hax
<Drake> 04I thought it was always 90...
<drfsupercenter> 03me too
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Ascendant> brave bird is powerful
<drfsupercenter> 03it's powerful but it only has 5PP and it lowers your stats
<Ascendant> I use it with staraptor
<drfsupercenter> 03and I hate move slike that
<Ascendant> my extremely weird staraptor
<Drake> 04...no
<Quanyails> 7Lowers stats?
<Ascendant> which has substitute, roost, close combat and brave bird
<Drake> 04Brave Bird deals damage like Take Down
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03then that
<Ascendant> SUBSTITUTE ON STARAPTOR HURRRR
<drfsupercenter> 03I was thinking CLose Combat, my bad
<Quanyails> 7Waaaait:
<Drake> 04lol NS
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate both moves
<Ascendant> close combat is actually good
<Quanyails> 7It's been 90 since Gen. 4? O__o
<drfsupercenter> 03any of those 5PP moves that either do recoil damage or lower your stats
<drfsupercenter> 03they annoy me
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep.
<Drake> 04Hey
*Quanyails 7LOLs.
<drfsupercenter> 03Fly and Surf are like the most pro things ever
<Ascendant> surf is good
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I love Surf
<Quanyails> 7I've got the Gen. 3 stats in my mind.
<drfsupercenter> 03lik even in battle
<drfsupercenter> 03it's fricking epic
<Quanyails> 7Surf is good.
<Ascendant> hydro pump can die in a tsunami or something
<Quanyails> 7Fly is meh.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Ascendant> surf > muddy water
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like
<drfsupercenter> 03who cares if it takes two turns
<drfsupercenter> 03they can't hit you
<drfsupercenter> 03when you're in the air
<drfsupercenter> 03so it really doesn't matter
<Quanyails> 7Thunder?
<Ascendant> they can with twister
<Ascendant> which does double damage if you are in the air
<drfsupercenter> 03well, then don't use Fly if you're fighting an electric type.
<drfsupercenter> 03but as I was saying
<Ascendant> twiiiister
<drfsupercenter> 03I turned battle animations off so it's just like fly, bam bam damage
<Ascendant> twister...twitter
<drfsupercenter> 03the battle animations in BW give me a massive headache
<Ascendant> mind blown
<drfsupercenter> 03because of how it keeps zooming in on the Pokémon
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like AHHHHHH MY EYES
<Quanyails> 7I like them, lol.
<Ascendant> "Dragonite used twitter on facebook! facebook fainted"
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate the camera effects.
<Ascendant> wat
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like
<drfsupercenter> 03picture looking through a camera
<Ascendant> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03zoom it in and out 20 times a minmute
<drfsupercenter> 03-m
<Quanyails> 7It's a spectacle.
<drfsupercenter> 03unless you're like, super hardcore, you're going to get dizzy.
<drfsupercenter> 03and that's what happened to me.
<drfsupercenter> 03when I first started BW it made me dizzy so I turned them off :|
<Quanyails> 7No one else commented on the dynamic camera.
<drfsupercenter> 03most people prolly don't care
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<drfsupercenter> 03and the weird thing is I'm not photosensitive or anything
<Quanyails> 7You do.
<drfsupercenter> 03like I've watched the Porygon episode a million times
<drfsupercenter> 03and never had any problems
<Quanyails> 7Gah, I'm pretty late in piano. X.x
<Quanyails> 7Fish you, IRC.
<drfsupercenter> 03well no, that's wrong. After a few loops of it I started getting dizzy.
<drfsupercenter> 03but still
*Quanyails 7AFKs.
*drfsupercenter JFKs

<drfsupercenter> 03I had Subway the other day.
<drfsupercenter> 03also
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what sucks
<Ascendant> subsupercenter

<drfsupercenter> 03including all bathrooms and everything
<drfsupercenter> 03until tomorrow morning
<drfsupercenter> 03so :|
<drfsupercenter> 03though being a guy I can always just pee out the window

<Ascendant> kill them with pee!
*Ascendant hides
<drfsupercenter> 03you know how gross that would be?
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<SilverSonic> or just humilate them
<Ascendant> xD
<drfsupercenter> 03Ultimately, you don't need to flush the toilets
<drfsupercenter> 03I can just use them normally and not flush XD
<Ascendant> put julia gillard underneath your window
<Ascendant> pee

<nickstr> oh gosh
<SilverSonic> !EW POLITICS
<drfsupercenter> 15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW POLITICS
<nickstr> so true
<Ascendant> politicians make me want to rape my own mind
<Ascendant> seriously
<Ascendant> not like it's possible
<nickstr> this is why I hate most talk radio shows
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ascendant> but
<nickstr> they are all politics or religion
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Nick
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr
<drfsupercenter> 03on our TV listings cahnnel
<Ascendant> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03they have talk radio as the audio
<drfsupercenter> 03it gets so annoying
<nickstr> it does
<drfsupercenter> 03I try to see what's on TV and I have to hear some crap about Libya
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like NO U
<drfsupercenter> 03and mute it
<Ascendant> but seriouisly
<Ascendant> politicis
<Stormy> well, I get to go work now, yay
<Ascendant> politics
<nickstr> what sucks is that talk radio is about all you get in some areas on AM
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Stormy> see ya
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I use FM :P
<SilverSonic> Politics suck butt
<Ascendant> mfw they think they're doing it right
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant
<drfsupercenter> 03you know
<drfsupercenter> 03I've had a couple people tell me that I'd make a good world ruler
<drfsupercenter> 03who agrees
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ascendant> lmfaaaaaao
<drfsupercenter> 03first things I'd do
<Ascendant> I can imagine that
<drfsupercenter> 03shut down the MPAA and RIAA
<nickstr> I have a few oldies stations, a country station, Radio Disney, and one of the last full service stations in the country
<drfsupercenter> 03and tell Apple to go f*** themselves
<SilverSonic> lmfao
<Ascendant> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03then I'd legalize piracy.
<drfsupercenter> 03and then
<drfsupercenter> 03???
<drfsupercenter> 03Profit
<SilverSonic> ALSO, you should get rid of every crappy tv show on MTV
<SilverSonic> x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I can just shut down MTV
<drfsupercenter> 03there's no reason we still need it
<drfsupercenter> 03when piracy is legal
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<nickstr> not to mention my own AM transmitter so if I don't like what I hear FU I can switch it on and have my OWN music on the air!
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr, why not just use your computer's speakers?
<drfsupercenter> 03why broadcast your own stuff and then use a radio
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just lossy
<drfsupercenter> 03just hook the computer up to your speakers XD
<nickstr> not really
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03gonna go get dinner
<drfsupercenter> 03I think I'll do Wendy's
<Ascendant> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03note I said 's
<Ascendant> well
<drfsupercenter> 03not "do Wendy"
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a difference
<nickstr> plus its really nice for adjusting receivers
<Ascendant> drf, make nothing on the internet illegal
<Ascendant> make everything free
<nickstr> calibrating the dial
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<SilverSonic> Make FL Studio Free
*SilverSonic runs
<Ascendant> make everyone give me free dedicated servers
<Ascendant> ???
<Ascendant> PROFIT
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ascendant> FL studio is easy to pirate
<drfsupercenter> 03SilverSonic if piracy is free, then who cares
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<nickstr> and the transmitter is for AM stereo which is GONE from the dial in my area
<Ascendant> just download the portable version
<Ascendant> XD
<nickstr> so I am making receivers that get it useful again
<SilverSonic> I have FL S 9 x.x
<SilverSonic> S.*
<Ascendant> but like
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03gonna go eat dinner
<Ascendant> politicians can go fuc* themselves in the ass
<Ascendant> oh wait
<Ascendant> they already do that
<drfsupercenter> 03you guys can start as a "DRF for world ruler" club if you want
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<SilverSonic> lol
<Ascendant> seeya drf
<Ascendant> !lag
<Ascendant> lmfao drf
<Spyrorocks> anyone want a nintendo ds lite for $70?
<Ascendant> XD
