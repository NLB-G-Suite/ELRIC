<YokuPony> valoreins: please don't remind me of that song.....

<Barbetos|AtWork> TF2 has changed so much since I have played it. =\
<YokuPony> My gold died years ago :(

<Barbetos|AtWork> Or it could even be blasphemy. one of those
<YokuPony> epic song is epic
<Barbetos|AtWork> These head shots are amusing.
<Sylandest> YokuPony: epic music increases combat ability by a factor of 5
<Barbetos|AtWork> Who uses the back burner anymore?
<YokuPony> It does seem to be working.....sorta :\
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<|Discord|> GG wrek. We all did a damn good job
<Meanwhile> It would appear to be inappropriate music time.
<Starchaser> wow epic music
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<Sylandest> howdy, Meanwhile!
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol that scout got owned
<WingedCursee> i want to join this game :(
<YokuPony> 'sup meanwhile!
<Sylandest> this music makes me feel like i need to do something dramatic and important...
<Meanwhile> This music sounds like it's part of a post battle montage.
<GilDash> The new Tomb Raider is either going to be very good, or very crap. Too early to tell yet.
<Starchaser> the song is brothers in arms by the northern kings
<Sylandest> GilDash: welcome back! :)
<GilDash> Sylandest: I was watching you the whole time, just so you know. ;)
<RustyMeat> Hello Bronystate I regret to inform you that Eduard Khil the trololol guy has died has a heart stroke.
<Meanwhile> The new Tomb Raider will probably be very much like the old Tomb RAider.
<Wrek|Dusty> 05no its Dire straits - brotehrs in arms covered by northern kings
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I hope so...
<Meanwhile> Which'd be fine if Tomb Raider weren't old enough to be sibling.
<Sylandest> GilDash: y-you were? :$ I hope I kept you entertained
<Meanwhile> Seriously, what is it with the industry and milking franchises?
<Meanwhile> Is it /that/ hard to think of something new?
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I dunno, but I just want a nice adventure game.
<Sylandest> Meanwhile: lately, it seems that way
<Meanwhile> Nintendo are the worst offenders but everyone seems to be doing it.
<Jim> ohai everypony
<Meanwhile> Allo Jim.
<Sylandest> howdy, Jim!
<GilDash> Meanwhile: No one takes risk because... well, risk is risk.
<Tov|Christmas> Adventure Time is having a game on the DS soon.
<GilDash> Jim: Holla! :)
<Jim> Stayed up all night working on this school thing, so tired
<Meanwhile> Yeah no one takes risk because they can just make the same crap over and over and stupids will still buy it.
<Meanwhile> Which is the only reason anything Nintendo makes actually gets bought.
<Sylandest> GilDash: I was actually waiting for you to return before I went to wash up, hehe. I didn't want to be rude and leave you hanging
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Welcome to life. Have a pleasant stay. :D
<GilDash> Sylandest: Tsk, I'm sure I wouldn't have minded. :D
<Tov|Christmas> How dare Nintendo make sequels.
<Meanwhile> Nintend make nothing /but/ sequels.
<Sylandest> GilDash: just trying to be a gentlecolt, hehe :$
<GilDash> Sylandest: That does mean you can't procrastinate from washing up now though. :p
<Sylandest> GilDash: .....shoot. did not think of that consequence
<GilDash> Sylandest: Off you go... :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol dat FlutterSPY! poster
<Sylandest> GilDash: yeah, yeah, I'm going...bah, washing up...I'm plenty clean
<Tov|Christmas> Because Dillon Rolling Western, Pushmo, … aw fuck it. *ignores Meanwhile*
<Sylandest> brb in a little while, everypony
<Meanwhile> Nintendos main buisness plan is to remake Mario Zelda and Metroid and the fact that it's working is the really depressing part.
<GilDash> Sylandest: I'll make you messy later. ;)
<Jim> I think I'll join this tf2-y goodness
<Sylandest> GilDash: wh-what? *blushes* :$
<ehm> Meanwhile: that's what people ask for
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> GilDash lol sounds like something Princess Molestia would say :D
<GilDash> Meanwhile: To be fair, why would you expect them to do anything different when people buy them up?
<Meanwhile> People are stupid as fuck.
<Meanwhile> I hate people.
<GilDash> Sketch_Toku_Brony: You think Molestia is bad. ;)
<Meanwhile> Anyway, dinner time. I'll be back to complain more later.
<Meanwhile> Y'all have a good one.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Please do. :D
<Starchaser> call of duty will be the big one for the fanboys out there
<Tov|Christmas> Nintendo's only made 6 traditional 2D mario games in the past 25 years excluding the 2 coming out this year.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hm. I get the impression Meanwhile thinks people are stupid.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> GilDash 0_o oh god... lol
<Tov|Christmas> And Lets ignore Operation Rainfall which was all about 3 new hardcore Nintendo IPs
<GilDash> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I've been referred to as one before. And a godslayer, iff I recall correctly. ;)
<alexxm> i miss much
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> GilDash ah i see lol
<YokuPony> I like Nintendo, but Mario is my least favortie of their franchises
*GilDash snuggles Sketch_Toku_Brony.
<alexxm> how come YokuPony
<GilDash> I don't really do Nintendo, so it doesn't really concern me.
<derpy_pony> hey
<YokuPony> alexxm: I dunno, it just never appealed to me as much as Zelda or Star Fox
<alexxm> hey derpy_pony hows your day been
<derpy_pony> as if you'd care
<derpy_pony> how was yours?
<alexxm> i'm good derpy_pony and i do care what happened
<Tov|Christmas> Nostalgia is best mind control
<YokuPony> although I have to admit, I did like Mario Sunshine
<alexxm> do the differant weapons have differant effects

<Lil_B> GilDash has the Chainsaw fuel?
*alexxm gives Lil_B a matchate

<|Discord|> 10 hour videos are so pointless
<alexxm> Lil_B now why did yiu want us to give you weapons
*alexxm hugs Petrified_Discord
<Cypresswolf> :) gotta love slow mondays
<Lil_B> alexxm i didn't :/ GilDash just gave me some
<Bronysith> Cypresswolf: eeeyup
<Jim> Lil_B: Was that a Crocodile hunter reference?
<Dken2021> Cypresswolf mmhmm
<alexxm> hey Cypresswolf hows your day been
<Ascendant> urgh
<Lil_B> Jim yes
<Dken2021> allo Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> all the office had was a circuit breaker delivery, now they're trying to make stuff up :D
<Lil_B> GilDash did you get the Maniac Mansion reference?
<Lil_B> 8 min until Microsoft E3 Conference
<Cypresswolf> If necessary, they'll give me someone else's to do list :P
<Bronysith> Lil_B: woot?
<Dken2021> sounds like gibberish
<alexxm> Lil_B how long do these things usaully last
<Jim> For a few hours, don't they?
<Dken2021> I think one hour iirc
<Cypresswolf> Is this half life?
<Lil_B> alexxm as far as i know about 60-90 min i think
<Petrified_Discord> Idk I thought it was more than an hour
<Darkts3> Cypresswolf: no
<Dken2021> it's Deus EX
<Skylands> 10Ascendant should be in bed
<alexxm> thanks Jim Dken2021 and Lil_B
<Bronysith> Wrek|Dusty: how much depth and complexity does this game have?
<Petrified_Discord> Bronysith: 5 depths and complexities
<GilDash> Lil_B: Uh, no. No reference I'm afraid. :$
<Cypresswolf> I didnt know you could get a crowbar in that game
*alexxm hugs Petrified_Discord
<Jim> I'm pretty sure it has 6 complexities though
*Petrified_Discord returns hug
<|Discord|> miah he miah hoo miah haha
<Ascendant> I'm doing my music presentation
<Jim> was that a cat I heard?
<alexxm> now does anyone have any ROCKET FUEL for the SPACE SHIP
<|Discord|> alexxm: I do have a party cannon if that works
<Jim> Ask Nic Cage
<Lithium> dead?
<Bronysith> Wrek|Dusty: haha you tazed his ass
<Jim> Bronysith: So he's a bumtaze?
*Petrified_Discord wishes he could see the stream :/
<Lil_B> GilDash too bad, its a known (freaking old) reference, because in Maniac Mansion, you could get a chainsaw, but its empty, a year later the same people made another game, and on mars you could find fuel, but you couldn't take it, because "This Fuel has no use in THIS game"
<Bronysith> Jim: ba dum tish
<HyperMetalLugia> lols
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<alexxm> why can't you Petrified_Discord
<HyperMetalLugia> artistic
<Lithium> so....what game is this?
<Bronysith> Lithium: its deus ex
<GilDash> Lil_B: Is it a game of some kind? Sounds like an adventure or a horror...?
<Lithium> cool, thsns

<Magical_pablez94> GilDash: bwahbwahbwah
<Dermathil> But still. WHY THE CROWBAR. This is in the 2050s
<GilDash> Magical_pablez94: Wort, wort, wort.
<Radu> Magical_pablez94: Which is his favorite pony?
*Magical_pablez94 feels like a god
<Jim> Maybe it's a sonic crowbar?
<GilDash> Dermathil: Never underestimate the usefulness of a good crowbar.

<Dermathil> It has that OH SHIT feeling you got in S1 finale
<Damos> of course my car is smoking underneath. -_-

<Damos> after I just got an oil change.
<Lithium> shame it's gonna be mostly kinect stuff :\

<Skylands> 10Oh, drf
<Insert_cupc4ke> The problem with Kinect stuff is that its Wii stuff
<Lithium> Insert_cupc4ke: Except worse controls...
<Insert_cupc4ke> exactly
<GilDash> I just am not a fan of motion control in general.
<Meanwhile> And the problem with Wii stuff is it's Wii stuff.
<drfsupercenter> 03?
<Lithium> dead
<Lil_B> Meanwhile at least watching all the coverages by the Funny Internet People afterwards will be fun... less so the immensly Stupid debate on "Who WON E3 this year"
<Lithium> I think Rainbow Dash will win E3
<Meanwhile> For once I get what you're saying GilDash.
<Skylands> 10I have a question regarding Pokémon Conquest. At GameStop, if you preorder from them (pay $5 extra than Target, Best Buy, wherever), you get codes to unlock Pokémon in the game. Do you think those codes are unique like the BW Dream World Lucario, or?
<Tov|Christmas> I'm a little jealous of the Kinect. Wish the Wii would have something more like it.
<WingedCurse> mane6 will win E3
<Cobellanez> Hello everyone
<Dken2021> so...how bout that kinect?
<Insert_cupc4ke> Hello Cobellanez
<GilDash> Meanwhile: :O
<Dken2021> hallo Cobellanez
<GilDash> Cobellanez: Holla! :)
<drfsupercenter> 03Not sure
<Meanwhile> Allo Cobellanez.
<drfsupercenter> 03but LOL paying for games
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm gonna just get the ROM
<Lithium> kinect = DO NOT WANT!!!
<Insert_cupc4ke> Kinect could be good, its just not. Some of that Pc modded stuff was pretty cool
<Meanwhile> I still can't believe that the Wii U is actually a thing.
<Dken2021> agreed, the mods are the only cool thing the kinect has been given
<GilDash> The Kinect has... potential, I'll give it that. Yet, I'm still not interested. :D
<Skylands> 10I may ask GameStop sometime, but they may lie/not answer because they WANT you to pay the extra $5
<drfsupercenter> 03of course
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why I avoid that place like the plague
<Strange-Benhur> hello everyone
<Lithium> Kinect is basicly the Eyetoy but with crapper games
<WingedCurse> time to end this game?
<Meanwhile> Allo Strange-Benhur.
<Skylands> 10Actually
<Skylands> 10they'll probably be like, "I don't know" but really do :P
<tgl1992> Should be loading the livestream imo right now :p
<Insert_cupc4ke> The worst thing about Kinect is the terrible demonstrations with the kids
<Skylands> 10Since lying looks bad if they get caught
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<TrixieBaconMuffin> Ass-tazing ? must be wrek streaming
<Dermathil> oh btw guys
<Dermathil> Pro controller for Wii U. Discuss.
<MysticLugia> 12ah finally back, stupid amd 12,4 driver made my laptops card unstabl,e donwgraded back to much more stable 12.1
<Lithium> I like it :)
<Meanwhile> Ripoff.
<drfsupercenter> 03you can probably just hack the save anyway :P
<Dken2021> a dressed up dualshock
<Tov|Christmas> Nintendo is copying the 360 controller. Pathetic

<derpy_pony> fear was fun until I discovered the slomo mode...
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Challenge: pew pew, pew
<GilDash> Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Splinter Cell known for its stealth? :S
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrimsonPhoenix: It's always the point silly :)
<Skylands> 10Going to church to sing songs and worship someone/something I don't know much about or agnostic is a waste of time, that's how I view it

<MegaMoonShine> In trouble? CALL IN A FREAKING MISSILE WITH ONE CLICK!
<Lithium> GilDash: stealth....in modern gaming?
<Tov|Christmas> Yes, and Resident Evil used to be known for survival horror.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, the thing is, Voice command is unnecessary and unefficient
<Darkts3> "All your bases are belong to us"

<Kakumy> XBOX is getting bankrupt thats y they change it to a TV too..
<Strange-Benhur> DAT SONG
<SuperBrony64> 11,02kirzstryfe: Okay, I can say that isn't true. That's the same as saying Wii Owners that only own a Wii aren't gamers or PS3 owners who only own a PS3 aren't gamers.
<Moltres> Articuno I have no idea how to even start commenting on all the honeymoon stuff you know!
<Pwah> :D
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> but can it bake cookies?
<Ascendant> ARTICUNO
<twilight_sprinkle> RustyMeat: xbox:"fu** you"
<Moltres> there's just SO much to say and then asdf
<tgl1992> Too much sports, and I love sports

<Ascendant> [02:53:59] <~Articuno> Before you PM me, I am dead tired
<Darkts3> Nittany_Discord: IKR
<Ascendant> [02:54:03] <~Articuno> I can't think straight
<GilDash> kirzstryfe: Again, I only own an xbox for gaming. Wish it wasn't so, but am I going to be labled a none-gamer now? :p
<Yankee> why doesn't xbox just come with its own tv screen
<Kakumy> What if you have to pay for it....
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/homework-class-test-that-actually-sums-it-up-pretty-well.jpg
<mitamaking> Well if you own an Xbox just for sports, you are not a gamer
<Ascendant> you can't be as tired as I am ;_;
<Ascendant> it's 3am right now
<Darkts3> Kinect seems like a waste of money
<Meanwhile> Because everyone buys an Xbox to watch sports.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Some people only own one console
<Chrysalis> no gamer alive owns a wii
<NewDCD> 09,01Games, who wants em? Have some shitty sports!
<Ascendant> I'm still attempting to finish my music project
<Articuno> 12Well I dunno.. I haven't had any sleep since Friday >v>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's another E3 of sequels, motion controls, and Kinect.
<Ascendant> x_X
<Moltres> jetlagged
<Staraptor> 2You should sleep :<
<SirGanjalf> XBOX, destroy that tank!
<Moltres> that can really mess with you
<RustyMeat> THESE PEOPLE ARE SO PHYSICED
<Sylandest> GilDash: I dont have an Xbox, only a Wii. but I love it
<twilight_sprinkle> i find your lack of tennis disturbing
<Kakumy> Confirm you need to pay money to see this crap...
<TrixieBaconMuffin> X-Box , selfdestruct!
<Tov|Christmas> :( I only own a Wii and 3DS. I'm a convenient stereotype for anti-fanboys.
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: Disappointing, isn't it.
<Moltres> it passes after a few days, 'Cubo
<Moltres> :>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Woah
<Articuno> 12Yeh 11 hours is the biggest I've ever done >v<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I mean another GoW?
<Pwah> Yankee: ikr?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, that's the same shit as last year
<GilDash> Sylandest: Not a fan of the Wii, to be honest.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What did that lady say?
<Darkts3> OMG MUSIC
<Wrek|Dusty> 05i dont consider the wii as a console. i consider the Wii to be a home entertainment tool. sxbox and PS3 are jsut money whores
<Lithium> so basically, Microsoft is appealing to one group of people and one group of people only -_-
<Insert_cupc4ke> or games, but apparently Microsoft can
<Articuno> 12Lol Cubo ^^
<Kakumy> And paying...
<valoreins> so far no games that mindblows me...
<Meanwhile> Xbox, porn.
<CrimsonPhoenix> The exact same shit
<mitamaking> Napster?
<MegaMoonShine> Oh great...
<Darkts3> Nittany_Discord: it was going to happen
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's the same shit for 3 years.

<Ninjazz> Meanwhile: I actually hope it does that. :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I swear she said 'Yes you can'
<Kakumy> Oh can you put pony songs inside?
<NewDCD> 09,01a library of Ke$ha and Justin Bieber!

<CrimsonPhoenix> OH BOY
<Ascendant> and I damn, I dont' think I'm going to get much sleep today
<MegaMoonShine> it'll be more crappy pop songs
<Darkts3> NewDCD: IKR
<Sylandest> GilDash: I can understand that, hehe. The Wii is more for the Nintendo diehards than anything. And Admittedly, I bought it for Zelda, Super smash bros, and Metroid. also Red Steel. Thats about it
<twilight_sprinkle> NewDCD: YESSSS
<Jim> Yeah...nobody will care about that music thingy

<GilDash> Sylandest: Don't get me wrong, I think Nintendo is a better company overall. I just don't think they're worthy of the hightened respect they get.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Microsoft really knows gamers.
<ZombieBrony> Hmm, spend 50 euro for a fitness game or go outside for free. Tough choice

<GarrettBrony> Darkts3 that is every Call of Duty ever
<valoreins> i now wonder if everything is directed by Michael Bay
<NewDCD> 09,01they had Zork playable in the title screen of BO <3
<Kakumy> Treyarch is better than Infinity Wards
<DerpSurge> MORE FPS BULLSHIT
<ZombieBrony> Imagine if Gabe just walked in
<CrimsonPhoenix> BLOODY SCREEN SO REAL
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Kool aid on the screen is back :(
<Darkts3> DERP

<Ninjazz> GilDash: At first, IW fucked EVERYTHING up with MW3. BO was actually pretty decent.
<MegaMoonShine> Why did you do that?!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02NewDCD: Yup, Treyarch >> Infinity Ward
<Dusty_Nomad> I would kiss gabe newell cause he is Gay ben.
<Tov|Christmas> I wonder this game will be on Wii U?
<CrimsonPhoenix> also no Health bar
<pony_1471> pewpewpewpewp

<Lithium> 13 year old little Shitheads magnet-the game
<Ninjazz> So far... Not bad...
<Kandarihu> The first Black Ops was all told in flashback form, right?
<MegaMoonShine> Fuck aiming!
<SirGanjalf> Now do the barrel roll!
<Dusty_Nomad> I <3 Gabe newell cause he is a brony
<Midnight_Tempest> there is nothing good about CoD... nothing at all
<Invi> looks easy
<Dark_Horst> yeah, might've been a good idea to use that thing BEFORE THEY MADE THE FIRST OVERPASS???
<AlienEd27> he is going to fire a missile launcher while the vehicle hangs from the highway
<Acheron187> It won't be a bad game
<tgl1992> They should rename the CoD series to Michael Bay's Wet Dream 4.
<Radu> Carl on Duty: Black Cops 2.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02IF this game is coming out on the Wii U, I'm getting it on the Wii U >>

<GarrettBrony> mr anderson
<Acheron187> It just looks like everyother one
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Meh. I never gave Treyarch a chance with BO after they fucked up so badly with their previous games.
<SirGanjalf> prom night?
<Radu> Dat hand
<Jim> I'm not gonna buy this
<|Discord|> Call of Booty:Big !@#$% 2
<Hat> I like it but it's only good for one playthrough
<Lithium> BTW, When's the Sony Conference?
<Tov|Christmas> at the end of the day. CoD doesn't suck.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Well... As far as CoD goes I meant.
<CrimsonPhoenix> This looks like everything that made the FPS genre horrible
<Acheron187> I'm not buying this either
<Dusty_Nomad> Gabenewell is santa clause he made TF2 Free
<Kakumy> I'm buying because I can make Pony Emblems :P

<Acheron187> Kakumy: I Agree
<Tov|Christmas> Odd are, the Wii U version will just use the Wii U 360 controller.
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: i never could get into fps...it just didnt work
<Lithium> COD is Mediocure at best, What really rustles my jimmies is how it's praised by 13 year old C*nts who think it's the best think ever >_>
<Hat> This is set in the future
<Dark_Horst> somehow i'm absolutely unexcited
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Their demo is just him sniping?
<ZombieBrony> So in 13 years we will have all this tec?
<Dusty_Nomad> I play games with no crosshairs like a boss.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dark_Horst: Same.
<SirGanjalf> xray, really? And you thought modern shooters couldn't be more easy

<MegaMoonShine> Interest? I have none
<Pwah> I despise fps's!
<Dark_Horst> i also like how battlefield made the jump into the hightech future YEARS ago with 2142 and yet they praise this stuff as new and innovative
<Radu> CS is sooo last decade.
<GilDash> Sylandest, Ninjazz: I like RPGs and FPSs both. :)
<Meanwhile> In the interest of how many fucks you actually give about this game we're skipping to the last 5 seconds.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This game looks like ODST for some reason >>
<Kakumy> CSGO...
<Hat> 2142 was great
<DerpSurge> THE GAME GOT BORED OF ITSELF
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: yay! :D
<Lithium> Kakumy: If I were a realy brony, I wouldn't flaunt my love for greatness in mediocre crud....
<pony_1073> Call of Duty is boring

<ZombieBrony> The gun looks like it's from boarderland
<NewDCD> 09,01admittedly, I like the setting
<Dusty_Nomad> NOT CS
<Dusty_Nomad> CSS
<Midnight_Tempest> ODST was at least a good game...
<Dken2021> Y'know what I like to see in call of duty? the army fighting robots
<thespitfirecolt2> so whats the difference it looks like any other cod game
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah this look very slow-paced
<Dusty_Nomad> Counter strike source
<Ninjazz> NewDCD: Same here.
<Sylandest> GilDash: I'm an rpg whore...you should see my game shelf, lol
<Midnight_Tempest> this just looks fucking boring...
<Kakumy> Lithium: I'm just getting Black Ops 2 to make pony Emblems :P

<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: futuristic, focus on civilian areas, i see what you mean
<Cedridor> Okay, I need advice, my hater freind is going to watch an episode... Which one do I reccomend?
<AlienEd27> hey, anypony want to find a multiplayer game we could play?
<NewDCD> 09,01I think I'll get it if it really has branching paths
<Ninjazz> You know this look sactually pretty cool...
<Acheron187> Dusty_Nomad: I know which one you mean
<Kandarihu> I suppose that now that Portal 2 ended with Chell escaping Aperture Science, the time is ripe for a Half-Life/Portal crossover. How does shooting bullets through portals sound?
<soulrider95> AlienEd27: BF3?
<Lithium> So Intense!
<GilDash> Ninjazz, Sylandest: I do like a range of genres, but beat 'em ups and sports/racing aren't really my thing.

<AlienEd27> soulrider95 , sorry, i don't have it
<Dark_Horst> i have BF3. there are ponyservers. but they're always empty
<Sylandest> GilDash: I appreciate RPGs and fps', but sports and racing are definitely a no in my book, hehe
<RankWinner> And here I thought they would show some Dawnguard news considering they bought the rights for first release Skyrim DLC
<Dken2021> Scoot-Scootaloo but it's a videogame. . .

<Barbetos|AtWork> Nittany_Discord I wouldn't let the current state of gaming get you down though. This is not the first time that the gaming market went through something like this. Back before nintendo there was a lot of shovel ware.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> GilDash: I just took one long break. :$
<Radu> Dusty_Nomad: VA=Voice Actor
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64: I lold.
<Vordox> LAAAWL
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Challenge: I think Magical_pablez94 has the right idea, actually... ;)
<WingedCurse> failing on purpose?
*Midnight_Tempest noms kirzstryfe
*Lil_B buys expensive new Monitor, Turns the power to 50% because eyes hurt :/
<Invi> you hit a spider :(
<Dusty_Nomad> WhAat film is double d's VA
<kirzstryfe> 8,6:p
<Lil_B> hi Invi :D
<Meanwhile> "Microsoft Quality Control"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not shovelware now. It's zero innovation.
<Invi> hi Lil_B
<pyrocatboy> Midnight_Tempest Look it up on TVTropes.
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash: :D about what?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> GilDash: What idea is that?
<Radu> Dat face
<Midnight_Tempest> pyrocatboy: nah, too lazy to do that
<WingedCurse> superbrony64 failin on purpose?
<alexxm> what if i want spiders in my candy
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Challenge: Accepting you as a challege, silly. ;)
<GarrettBrony> mmmm Spider Candy
<SirGanjalf> Why the box is there, nothing goes in it?
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Malavolent> alexxm: Dunno how about you but I don't like candy in my spiders.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Kandarihu> Well, at least there's indie gaming.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nittany_discord the innovation can still be found from the IPs that are not apart of some corperate agenda atleast.
<Radu> LOL
<pyrocatboy> Midnight_Tempest http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/ssxtrickyps2_004-large_1052.jpg
<Ninjazz|Challenge> GilDash: I'm no challenge. :<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even with sequels, zero innovation.
<Magical_pablez94> REMIX 10
<Dusty_Nomad> YOU HIT SPIDERS CATCH CHOCOLATE
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Challenge: I disagree. ;)
<twilight_sprinkle> i kinda liked the fitness stuff
<Chimera> hi
<Midnight_Tempest> pyrocatboy: yeah, as i said... not interested in games like that, im an RPG buff... not a sports fan
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash: i have the right idea about what?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> GilDash: You're just trying to keep me from heading off arn't you? :)
<Pwah> blimp!
<GarrettBrony> OH THE HUMANITY!
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Magical_pablez94: I'm a challenge, apparently. :$
<GilDash> Magical_pablez94: Ninjazz being a challenge. ;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because innovation is risky, and major publishers can't afford risks, so major publishers can't afford to innovate.
<Dusty_Nomad> Guys chocolate or sweets?
<Vordox> HOW can we make this scene funny...?
<Invi> the sun looks pissed of
<Dusty_Nomad> Did did ya did did ya
<Magical_pablez94> Ninjazz|Challenge: GilDash ... i guess i hadn't :D
<Dusty_Nomad> Stop doing me
<PrincessLuna> I don't know what in the hell I walked in on
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Challenge: I'm not trying to do anything. You're letting yourself get distracted. ;)
<PrincessLuna> What in the hay are we watching?
<GarrettBrony> Donk
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs PrincessLuna

<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Which is why some Indie games are doing so well, obviously. :D
*PrincessLuna cuddles Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Challenge: Stop *being* distracted. ;)
<Meanwhile> To the mooooooooooon.

<Ninjazz|Challenge> Hey PrincessLuna.
<Magical_pablez94> REMIX 10!!!
*Ninjazz|Challenge stops being distracted
*PrincessLuna hugs GilDash
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And forcing crap like heavy DRM, online passes, and day one on-disc DLC turns people away.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This was a huge risk :)
*Dusty_Nomad goes to the moon then eats moon cheese and dies.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02And it succeeded :3
<Darkts3> lol E3's interest levels were Halo 4 and South Park
<Radu> Why SuperBrony64?
<Magical_pablez94> hi PrincessLuna :D how're ya today?
<Vordox> LAWL SuperBrony64
<PrincessLuna> Hey, how're you Ninjazz|Challenge ?
<Dusty_Nomad> Dammit ads in my face
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Nostalgi Remix 8? :P
<Dusty_Nomad> 185 Love? I dont care
<Dusty_Nomad> 18%
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Well, it's a weird game that might have turned off a lot of buyers, but instead, it was awesome and fun enough to draw a crowd.
<PrincessLuna> Magical_pablez94: hey pablez :) I'm good, how about you?
<Kandarihu> Well, this is why we need to vote with our wallets. If stagnation becomes a greater risk than innovation, the big companies are going to feel the pressure to innovate.
<alexxm> hey PrincessLuna hows your day been
<Radu> Oh
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Good, PrincessLuna. Doing that stupid ULTIMATE BRONY CHALLENGE, right now. :)
<PrincessLuna> alexxm: Hot T_T
<GarrettBrony> alexxm how is YOUR Day Been?
<Dusty_Nomad> WHATS THE ULTIMATE BRONY CHALLANGE?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not only stagnation. Exploitation.
<PrincessLuna> Ninjazz|Challenge: ultimate brony challenge?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I know the point of Rhythm Heaven is to be weird and different, but from a financial perspective, it was going to be a gamble I think.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because gamers are very exploited.

<RainBowJack> why is it every time i see family guy and hear Meg talk i hear Twilight?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not sure if any effort was put into the G3 ponies.
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Challenge: See, not it's not even me distracting you. ;)
<Vordox> The rescue of NINTENDO and why NINTENDO is still strong is cause of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_SPD
<alexxm> ah right thanks Lil_B sorry about that

<Dusty_Nomad> Pinkie pie needs to go to sugar cube corner and get me some chocolate
<prince-dari> Hah, welcome back SR.

<Malavolent> Ninjazz|Challenge: You either watch ponies 25 hours daily or you're not a brony!
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Wishing me luck, GilDash?

<Ninjazz|Challenge> Malavolent: Too much of a good thing is a bad thing.
<Dusty_Nomad> I don't watch MLP Daily but I hear its song everyday(Themes/remixes whatever)
<Ninjazz|Challenge> GilDash: Oh you... :$

<SuperBrony64> 11,02MLP is on Netflix
<Lil_B> Vordox Nintendo had a lot of losses in their income over the last year, because they were busy building the Nintendo Network+ Developing the WiiU + Building this Huge new Development Facility. Plus the Yen got very Strong and Nintendo transforms all their Profits Into yen, So they still got the same asmount of money, but it was just worth less
<Dusty_Nomad> Whats netflix :|
<Vordox> Air Rally? D:
<PrincessLuna> alexxm: Yes!!!!

<Om> Open those doors
<Darkts3> wow ded already
<Ninjazz|Challenge> TheRainbowDash: Indeed. :3
<Airpuff> AlienEd27: .... Want does not simply watch "too much" ponies
<CK|MoarDed> Oh good, more chest-high walls with cover based shooter scenarios. MY HOW RIVETING
<TheRainbowDash> The Medal of Honor Warfighter game uses the Frostbite 2 engine, am I correct?
<Darkts3> Ya
<ingwaz> yeah...with shades like these BUILT INTO YOUR FACE, you're ready for anything
<Darkts3> just said it
<Ponies47> Back :)
<Vordox> TheRainbowDash: Yes
<TheRainbowDash> I see...expecting a lot of bugs and problems then.
<CK|MoarDed> I kinda wish someone would make a FPS where you just tank the shit out of enemy bullet fire like you did back in the 90s, just to stir the pot some.
<RAWRity> LOOK HOW MUCH GREY WE CAN FIT INTO THE SCREEN!
<Airpuff> Da Choppah!
<DuskStarshimmer> So this is Dues Ex On stream?
<Darkts3> lol nice A.I
<CK|MoarDed> This "realism" crap puts me totally out of it.
<Dark92Enigma> I'm here!
<AlienEd27> well, I can't stand watching 480p mlp youtube uploads :'( i need quality ponies...
<TheRainbowDash> Yes, the graphics are amazing, but the new updated engine of Frostbite needs more stability.
<alexxm> hey Dark92Enigma hows your day been
<Vordox> OOH
<Vordox> COOL
<Vordox> Breaching options
<Airpuff> AlienEd27: then find some!
<CK|MoarDed> RAWRity: Behold, as you leave the grey ocean waters and enter the grey ruins in a dusky time of day!
<DuskStarshimmer> AlienEd27, I've got all 720p rips, they werent extrodinarily hard to find
<Dark92Enigma> DEUS EX machina REVOLULUTION
<Vordox> NOO
<Darkts3> lol THOSE OPTIONS
<Vordox> Don't go COD
<TheRainbowDash> Ugh, cliche slow motion shots again.:\
<CK|MoarDed> Medal of Honor: Modern Greyscale
<Tov|Christmas> We need more arctic warfare games. These desert shooters have too many colors.
<SirGanjalf> Aaaaand, here goes the only new feature
<Darkts3> oh god
*alexxm hugs Aliened27 i'll pm you some sites that have quality uploads
<cachi01> dem slow mo headshots lol
<Radu> Also, Valve confirmed Half Life episode 3 not coming out on E3
<Darkts3> Radu: omg
<CK|MoarDed> BULLET TIME OH SHIT THE ORIGINALITY'S KILLING ME
<AlienEd27> but I've done nothing else than ponies for three weeks 6_9
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm a little saddened, because Edvard Gil AKA Trolololo Guy died last night
<Radu> Darkts3: I said NOT
<Vordox> Destructible areas
<Litwick> fucking about on tumblr right now. DND.
<RAWRity> CK|MoarDed: behold, you're such a great soldier you need 4 HEADSHOTS to down an enemy
<Barbetos|AtWork> Valve is too busy with its hat wearing simulator.
<Darkts3> i didnt know MOH went Halo on us
<TheRainbowDash> Vordox: How original, they did that already with the Battlefield series.
<cachi01> oh the trololo guy died? damn :(
<CK|MoarDed> Ooooo, grey smoke/.
<CK|MoarDed> I've never seen a game with grey smoke when stuff blows up!
<Darkts3> cachi01: sadly yes... damn disease
<Insert_cupc4ke> is it just me or do these games just feel like americans going around killing natives now
<Acheron187> Cool your playin DEUS EX
<TheRainbowDash> Oh my Celestia, 50% of the fucking Medal of Game game is gray.:D
<Darkts3> HIS TROLOLO WILL LIVE ON
<TheRainbowDash> *Honor game
<RAWRity> my god. POKEMONE RED/BLUE HAD MORE COLORS.
<cachi01> medal of honor warfighter now thats an original name :l
<Acheron187> I myself have yet to play it
<Radu> :|
<CK|MoarDed> Medal of Honor: Nothing's Happening Yet
<Darkts3> WHOAA ORIGINALITY
<Ninjazz|Challenge> So, are you guys like watching TV and chatting about it here or something?
<Vordox> Whoa
<Vordox> Nice use
<NewDCD> 09,01MEDAL OF GENERICNESS
<AlienEd27> hmm, maybe i should continue my second playthrough of this game :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> Pre-render cut scene song is better than this pre render.
<CK|MoarDed> My god, using tactical drones?
<E3Surge> NewDCD: :D
<SirGanjalf> trololo guy = Eduard Khil, to be precise
<Om> Ninjazz|Challenge: Yes. And I don't even know.
<AJTheMightyGamer> hey everypony
<Barbetos|AtWork> Aussie!
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Om: No wonder... Thanks.
<CK|MoarDed> That way you can do what you should be doing, BEING A BADASS WITH A GUN WHO JUST SITS THERE.
<Acheron187> throw a box at the solidiers
<Obsidian> NewDCD: The graphics look good though
<Insert_cupc4ke> its sad when a robot with guns and a grenade launcher is boring
*Yellowquiet hugs AJTheMightyGamer
<TheRainbowDash> Ugh, more of tricking the consumer into buying the same game over and over again. Medal of Honor: warfighter, doesn't even look that good as of Battlefield 3, and even that game did not live up to my fullest expectations. I refuse to buy a similar game, for the sake of destroying my waller, EA.
<cachi01> shut up a robot is killing people in a realistic fps :O
<Radu> The trailer is kinda long
<Om> Ninjazz|Challenge: If you expected more form me. I feel sorry for you.
<Darkts3> its funny because the exact same thing is from Mw3
<Tov|Christmas> I am liking the smoke effects though.
<AJTheMightyGamer> um.... thank you for the hug Yellowquiet (hugs back)
<TheRainbowDash> Tov|Christmas: Yeah, same thing as in Battlefield 3.:\
<TheRainbowDash> Meh...
<Airpuff> Om: :D
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Om: No... I don't ever except much from you, man.
<Darkts3> Lol
<CK|MoarDed> Okay, we get it. The guns work.
<Insert_cupc4ke> multiplayer campaign?
<Darkts3> did a gun wielding robot get destroyed by a rock?
<CK|MoarDed> Now show us something....wait that's it?
<Om> Ninjazz|Challenge: Oh good :)
<Dken2021_> so the're robot?
<cachi01> okay shoot shoot and shoot got it
<Yellowquiet> AJTheMightyGamer : always a pleasur ;D
<CK|MoarDed> THAT IS IT?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> drones
<RAWRity> "Yeah"
<Radu> South Korea? Really?
*Ninjazz|Challenge pats Om's head
<Tov|Christmas> 1 reason I love ponies is to spite stuff like this.
<Darkts3> Dken2012_: no its a gun manning a robot
<TheRainbowDash> That was okay, at best.
<Darkts3> Dken2012_: err guy
<Vordox> No Swedish? With our Fifth best military in the world? WELL SCREW you EA:
<AJTheMightyGamer> what we watching?
<TheRainbowDash> Medal of Honor, eh..
<cachi01> omg 12 tiers how interesting
<Yellowquiet> DeusEx
<AJTheMightyGamer> ah
<SirGanjalf> Radu: Why not, maybe they have kickass special forces?
<Yellowquiet> i think
<Dken2021_> Darkts3 I want my army vs robots game :(
<Darkts3> OMG FROSTBITE 2 Give it GOTY
<CK|MoarDed> "No shooter is complete without a multiplayer" and by that we mean, no FPS is a game without a multiplayer, because you sure as hell won't get more than 4 hours of our half-assed attempt at single player.
<Ray> 02Well, got to go everyone
<alexxm> TheRainbowDash that war fighter name wasn't a joke right
<SirGanjalf> In fact, with a neighbour like that...
<Ray> 02Nini~
<Radu> Dat Linkin Park
<Darkts3> lol
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: It was not, it is the actual name of the next Medal of Honor game.
<cachi01> i liek linkin park :3
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma what do you think of that wwe are you serious thing

<Darkts3> OH GOD MORE SPORTS
<RAWRity> WARFIGHTER
<Dken2021_> and more EA sports
<cachi01> more sports :l
<alexxm> hey Gamer_Luna what have you been up to
<TheRainbowDash> Vordox: Yeah, EA steals stuff.:D
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Om: Well... I liked what I could remember. In comparrison, it really did feel more focussed on friendship.
<Gamer_Luna> Bananas
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> IT LOOKS THE SAME!!!
<alexxm> TheRainbowDash and people wonder why games will never be taken serriously by most of the media
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I've done everything in the game though, got no-alarm and no-kill in the same run, hard mode >.<

<Insert_cupc4ke> FIFA is a fantastic game
<RustyMeat> SO how about that game of thrones finale
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Airpuff: We've already have so much... I don't see how things can get better. Plus, we've already heard that MUCH of the original staff is leaving. I'm not looking particularly foward to it.
<AlienEd27> hmm, that's not my usual path :3
<CK|MoarDed> And that's why FIFA 13 will include Facebook this year
*Tov|Christmas sighs and begins to pirate Game of Thrones Season 2.

<Ninjazz|Challenge> Airpuff: I can be proven wrong. :$
<cachi01> more than 11 million?
<RAWRity> When's Facebook just gonna go ahead and buy EA?
<Insert_cupc4ke> Social networking with sports games makes a whole lot of sense
<Airpuff> Ninjazz|Challenge: i hope so :'(
<Darkts3> May God help us all
<cachi01> THATS OVER 10 MILLION
<CK|MoarDed> RULE NUMBER 1 OF FOOTBALL CLUB IS THAT YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT FOOTBALL CLUB

<AJTheMightyGamer> waiting for him to be spotted
<CK|MoarDed> Stop saying innovations.
<Tov|Christmas> Hasbro had its own brand of Legos. It never had a chance.

<twilight_sprinkle> i played first crysis and it was meh imo
<GilDash> Airpuff: I think I can handle this... one sec...
<Om> Airpuff: That really isn't any of my concern. Gotta obey orders and what not.
<Vivix> Crysis 1 was fun, didn't like the story but the gameplay was fun
<CriticKitten> YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SHOVE EM SO FAR UP YOUR ASS
<Airpuff> GilDash: ..Handle.. what?....
<Darkts3> Hat: thats because of piracy forcing them to go to consoles
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: THEY'RE TOTALLY GONNA DO IT.
<GilDash> Om: Omfee, if you do this, you have to replace Airpuff for me. ;)
<twilight_sprinkle> the story in first crysis was retarded and cliche
<Lambo> Tov|Christmas: Nah, just watching latest footage on youtube. I don't even know where the stream is
<Airpuff> Om: D:
<Hat> I still mess around with the North Koreans and super strength
<Irish_Pony> GilDash: Still! Like it was my fault that England killed 1/4 of our population :'(
<NewDCD> 09,01I hate the whole social aspect
<NewDCD> 09,01I mean
<NewDCD> 09,01I'm an antisocial fuckhead
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: You were the one who brought it up. I don't care. :D
<Om> GilDash: Sure, I'll take off your head too.

<Airpuff> GilDash: Phew. Safe. xD
<GilDash> Om: I haven't given you the axe yet. :|
*Soital throws a Latté to SS
<Tov|Christmas> That Sim City facebook seemed worth checking out
<Irish_Pony> NewDCD: Now I love you.......
<Soital> 12:D
<Lambo> Man, that trailer with the ship looked like it set up a Dead-Space Style Halo with a woman as protagonist. That would be an interesting change, actually
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: ULTIMA X, AND IT'S GOING TO BE ENTIRELY ON FACEBOOK. AND NEW DLC EVERY WEEK.
<CriticKitten> I CAN'T HOLD ALL THIS INNOVATION
<Jim> sneaky sneaky
<Om> GilDash: I have my own. Made it myslef.

<cachi01> YUNO Shamroc!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6so are we up to 8 or 9?
<Irish_Pony> kirzstryfe: 5
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: for wat?
<cachi01> Shane377: DAMN THATTAB FAIL LOL
<Vivix> NewDCD: You are right though, the more social and online aspects that are forced into SP games, the crazier the DRM and harder it is to play without internet
<Ponies47> Bronysith: what?
<GilDash> Om: I might just have to cover it in chocolate sauce. ;)
<Obsidian> Does Wrek have the Tranquilizer Rifle?
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: THE AVATAR NO LONGER KNOWS WHAT BRITANIA IS. HE ALSO NEEDS A 2 HOUR TUTORIAL ON HOW TO EAT.
<Shane377> cachi01: how is it a tab fail
<kirzstryfe> 8,6no, I know he's restarted at least 7 times, if not more
<Om> Airpuff: Oh, and I have a friend that would love to meet your soon to be headless body
<Airpuff> GilDash: You and that chocolate sauce.. xD
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: oh lol
<Shane377> cachi01: i tabbed u ddidnt i
<CriticKitten> Okay, time to go watch Microsoft's conference and see how badly they fucked up. I imagine it couldn't have been that much worse than EA....right?
<CriticKitten> ....right?
<CriticKitten> >_>;
<Airpuff> Om: ...... Wha...?
<Om> GilDash: The axe? Sure, why not.
<Tov|Christmas> RAWRity: What's a paladin?
<cachi01> Shane377: but i tried to tab you and i fail
<Lambo> Even Splinter Cell is getting streamlined. Desert? Future warfare? No more stealh, but more action? What is wrong with the industry

<Vivix> The industry is being raped by bad indie games and bad movies
<alexxm> hey Gamer_Luna what have you been up to
<Om> Airpuff: To give you an example, he killed chickens with his bare hands as a child.
<SirGanjalf> NewDCD: I think Blizzard just passed the line: You have to actually play multi, to play single.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6which Wrek failed to do
<kirzstryfe> 8,6and 8
<Vivix> I takled him out of it

<Alchemist> by the way, wouldnt it be a more accurate phrase to say you only die once? only living once includes being immortal, so in that case you have no reason to act irresponsibly.

<Bronysith> http://memegenerator.net/instance/21481709
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03If you express your love to someone else in the chat, you are doing excessive RPing, and you will fail...
<Gamer_Luna> Bye everypony :)
<ScootaChicken> Airpuff: Yeah, you're not RPing now. Bit like a murderer in court saying 'What! I'm not shanking anyone now!'
<Airpuff> GilDash: There is no argument really. just the RP haters claiming it to be strictly forbidden in all forms -.-
*kirzstryfe flails in chat
<Om> I like this music.
*Gamer_Luna Hugs Alicorn_Shane and Irish_Pony
<Bronysith> http://memegenerator.net/instance/21481939
<Meanwhile> RP isn't strictly forbidden, just restricted.
<GilDash> Airpuff: I'm not talking about it. That's my only line.
<ScootaChicken> Airpuff: That's because it fucking is.
<Om> In fact. I love this music.
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: <3
<SilverSonic> <Angel_Umbreon> chill o.o; <-- I am chill, but Jun seriously annoys me and he should take a hint an leave me alone.
<Airpuff> ScootaChicken: Lol its not. Read the rules over.

<Dark_of_Max> crashed
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Ok <3
<Bronysith> Wrek|Dusty: this is for you http://memegenerator.net/instance/21481982

<Vivix> Noone was moaning abou the rule though
<Om> Kissing and licking is definetly NOT okay.
<Tov|Christmas> maaan. I'm gonna miss Matrix 2 Rifftrax tonight.
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile How do you take the words right out of my mouth? Are you a wizard?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Way to intenify it.
<Alicorn_Shane> Airpuff: something wrong with my nick
<Vivix> They were moaning about the interpretation
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03If you're being a jerk, you're not cool :|
<Airpuff> Bronysith: i must say he is taking the crashes really good o.o
<kirzstryfe> 8,6the arguement is when people starting with the love RP, the licking, etc, you're forcing that on people that are here because this is NOT an RP channel
<|Discord|> Meanwhile: I just think that RP is too lengthy to be in reg chat servers.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Yeah, the argument is becoming more of an issue then the problem.
<Airpuff> Alicorn_Shane: Woot? How come?
<Meanwhile> I left my robe and wizard hat downstairs.
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03If you are moaning, you are not cool :|

<Vivix> Well, I get htat, it's awkward when people try to rp with you
<Aurora> then maybe
<kirzstryfe> 8,6there are quite a few RP channels on the network, and if you feel the need to express your love in character to someone, go to one of them, create your own, or take it to PM
<Aurora> ask him nicely
