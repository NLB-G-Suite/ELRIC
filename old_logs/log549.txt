<SeaponiesofLiverpool> the armadillo is the true god
<Nyst> So who made the original map to the place?

<Lightning-Quill> Het you are only to give hints not full blown stuff away
<Nyst> Oh cool.
<Dark92Enigma> NAAAAAAAAAAAO
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> they have obsidian though which apparently is really storng and take very long to break
<Kammerjunk> So according to the legends, I suppose the El Dorado must be pretty damn close to the largest gold mine ever.
<RosePetal> See how amazing we can work together.
<DSNesmith> this sounds like Pirates music
<Tassadork> Sundaysmile: it got wet. you know how wet cats are

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> sacrifice the gold to the gods
<DSNesmith> hey, he got the girl at least
<JESmith71> Or they should have waited the week and got the bigger boat that could carry it all
<Darkspine_Sonic_Pony> Bye bye my precious gold :'(
<Eagle3302> she got all wet
<FlaschenJoe11> why white clothes no react like in real live?
<Barbetos> Suddenly the horse is back
<Kammerjunk> Jim: To close El Dorado.
<SolairePony89> Jim: No time to get the gold off the boat I guess
<Freefall29> sex or gold.... hard pick
<Nyst> They'll probably end up with one or two pieces of gold left.
<Meanwhile> I'd be happy with that.

<RosePetal> Here they come.
<Kammerjunk> Gold is easier to come by than Chel.
<pony_4107> the horse is a lie
<Whiskra> why do the heroes never get the gold... every single movie or book where gold is one of the goals, they never get it
<MI9000> SERIOUS FACE
<Sundaysmile> evil goatee
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> its a matter of weight, the boat = not heavy and thus not enough to crash the cave
<Dark92Enigma> THE HORSE WILL LIVE!
<Pale_Horse> It's really for the best. The bottom dropped out of CGI-produced gold 3 years later... :P
<Eagle3302> wow he dead
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> he's so dead now

<otakon> Power_Of_Chaos_Emera: clear you cache, see if Flash is up to date and set local storage on the video to unlimited
<IshAztecPony> Nel Hooks
<Meanwhile> I have Men in Tights somewhere on VHS.
<Kammerjunk> Am I the only one who automatically tunes out whenever the credits roll? It's like they have that perception filter the Doctor used in the end of S3.
<otakon> fluttercry: he makes funny movies as it should be
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> did we have a Mel Brooks week?
<hen3ry> Is season 3 sneak preview next. *trololo*
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> fluttercry: that means we have a 4th wall that nees reinforcing andf guarding
<Mutterguy> All the main characters have their own animation team....odd
<IshAztecPony> Meanwhile I have it on dvd
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Mel Brooks is best pony.
<CountDoofus> I'll catch Robin Hood tomorrow. Past 2AM here, getting kinda tired.
<Narolas> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Not with some servers, mods and plugins, it's still fresh
<Saigneur> the first time i came here, i was playing minecraft, now i only chat xD
<Rookeealding> I know that's a trol and all but that would be awesome
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> GOD IM SO DRUNK
<Chrysalis> fluttercry he is awesome
<Freefall29> what's the next pony episode?
<Kammerjunk> Freefall29: Ponyville Confidential.
<SolairePony89> Yeah. Anything I can skip?
<Saigneur> hey CountDoofus
<MirrorImage> fluttercry: because they're good and they're funny and because Mel Brooks.
<pony_6467> :'(
<Captain_MasterBoss43> CountDoofus, hahaha your tired now...
<Ninjazz> http://derpy.me/XJL0Z
<Freefall29> love that episode
<_Dan> I miss my childhood
<Midnight_Fyre> I predict that by the end of the year we will have seen every Mel Brooks movie
<CountDoofus> Evening, Saigneur
<JESmith71> Hey if John de Lancie hates lying in the media, he must hate the CMC in this episode since they're the Ponyville version of Fox News in this episode
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> so we HAVE had a Mel Brooks week?
<Rookeealding> How come we haven't had any rumors on season 3 yet?
<Freefall29> diamond tiara returns.
<MirrorImage> heck, the only reason i'm here right now is because it's Mel Brooks
<fluttercry> 05,15PaladinDrunkenwolf Indeed. AND I SHALL LEAD THE DEFENSE! To arms my brothers! The 4th wall needs us!
<MirrorImage> Rookeealding: no
<Unnr> Ninjazz: Where did you find that?
<MirrorImage> other than minimum 13 episodes
<SolairePony89> Midnight_Fyre: And hopefully ever Monthy Python movie
<Freefall29> Midnight_Fyre: I hope next week we do blazing saddles
<Ninjazz> Unnr, a friend sent me it. :3

<Crossbone> Wow, this chat's so fast
<CountDoofus> Captain_MasterBoss43: Yeah, the middle of the night by being in Europe does that to you.
<SolairePony89> Freefall29: It's been done already
<JESmith71> ...maybe I should have waited for the episode to actually start before saying that
<Captain_MasterBoss43> Sumica: I've prv messaged you.
<Ninjazz> Om, once again... I'm okay with this.
<Rookeealding> I mean wasn't it this time last year that we started hearing rumors of season 2?
<Freefall29> what...
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wow. This film was SHORT.
<Saturn> 08,01WAFFLES!
<Midnight_Fyre> I think we did Blazing Saddles within the last 6 months
<hen3ry> JESmith71: gossip columnist isn't same as fox news. gossip lie about famous people because famous. Fox lie about everything because power.
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> Saturn: bring it on!!!!!!!!!!

<Captain_MasterBoss43> CountDoofus I live in Sweden egghead. -.-
<Om> Ninjazz: :D good
<Crossbone> Nope.
<Kammerjunk> The Road to El Dorado has a runtime of only 62:14.
<Crossbone> This is my first time here.
<SparklyWaffles> Yay, I get hug! ;)
<otakon> IshAztecPony: too late ate some already
<Freefall29> oh well. time for ponies
<DSNesmith> good movie, deserved better critical reception than it got
<MirrorImage> someone link Crossbone to the youtube of this chat reacting to Derpy Speaks
<CountDoofus> Captain_MasterBoss43: And I was supposed to know that how?
<otakon> Kammerjunk: wow really?
<mitamaking> I'm back

<Kammerjunk> otakon: Yup.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Wb mitamaking
<Captain_MasterBoss43> Wtf is happening to my chat?
<Dark92Enigma> BROMANCE
<Freefall29> I wonder if princess celestia would make a good president
<Eagle3302> Crossbone is my BRo, don't mess with him kay?
<otakon> DSNesmith: it was trying TO hard to be Disney and was a little more adult than it should have been
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> all my bromance
<Saigneur> hey GilDash
<Midnight_Fyre> I didn't really like it that much. Didn't hate it, but I wasn't too impressed
<alexxm> i'm good Saigneur on summer break from college now how about you
<Tassadork> Crossbone: new ep streams are an absolute blast. try to be here for them
<Crossbone> Haha
<IshAztecPony> otakon's sexy ass for A movie
<durger> Rookeealding, yeah but that was because of some leaks from TopDraw animation. they've been very carful since then
<GilDash> Saigneur: Holla! :)
<Saigneur> Irish_Pony FTW hi dude
<Crossbone> Sure will do
<Spectrum_Rush> so any way how've ya been Ninjazz
<Kammerjunk> DSNesmith: I love this film. I'm 16, so my idea of nostalgia is anything from 2004 and before.
<SolairePony89> Freefall29: NASA would be funded pretty well at least
<Eagle3302> New episodes :( that will take a while
<Tassadork> yeaah...
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, been better. How bout you? :)
<SparklyWaffles> *ties balloon to Saturn *
<Rookeealding> Sigh.. that is a shame... wish there was something rumor wise though
<Kammerjunk> So yeah, I watched this all the goddamn time.
<SolairePony89> Freefall29: If you know what I mean...
<Power_Of_Chaos_Emera> I can't wathc my little pony with this lagg :'( :'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
<mitamaking> New episode streams are not that great, too many chatters, good for me though, I don't have cable
<JESmith71> Well maybe Tara will leak more generic Twilight lines
<AlienWarhead> We'll new episodes eventually, they're working on it
<Rookeealding> It would put the fandom in a tissy
<Freefall29> SolairePony89: yeah. I know what ya mean. lol
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: Agreed. Plus the general mannerisms of the characters, which was the primary source of humor, kind of got annoying after a while
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> Rookeealding: well itll be all that more epic when i eventually comes to fruition
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: 'bout the same :$
<Unnr> Saturn + balloon = hover saturn?
<Narolas> I'm kinda worried that season 3 has only 13 episodes planned, it seems a bit short :(
<Freefall29> SolairePony89: that joke works better with princess luna
*Ninjazz hugs Spectrum_Rush ^_^
<mitamaking> So narrator time?
<SparklyWaffles> Unnr lol
<Lightning-Quill> I prefer to be Surprised
<SolairePony89> Freefall29: But why would Luna want to go to the moon?
<alexxm> i find i tend to get to much lag during new episode streams
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> Pony Time
<AlienWarhead> Narolas It might change
<DSNesmith> right, imma go do something till the mel brooks comes on
<mitamaking> Narolas: Number isn't confirmed yet
<Rookeealding> I wish they would anoucne more than 13 episodes at lwast
*Spectrum_Rush hugs Ninjazz back ^_^

<Whirlybird> POLICE BRUTALITY
<RyunosukeKnT> Bless you!
<Ninjazz> Bless you.
<Vordox> QUICK TRIVIA: When Robin Hood first comes across Ahchoo, he is being beaten by a group of soldiers, and Ahchoo says, "I hope someone is getting a video of this thing." This is a reference to the Rodney King beating in the early 1990s, when a group of L.A.P.D. officers beat a black motorist and a bystander captured it on video. The acquittal of the officers sparked the L.A. riots.
<pooorfluttershy97> lol

<SirGanjalf> *cue Running in the 90's*
<Vordox> QUICK TRIVIA: When Ahchoo first appears, he and Robin fight Prince John's knights with a style Robin calls "Praying Mantis". Praying Mantis is an actual martial art - a style of Kung Fu emphasizing grabbing your opponent and bringing him to the ground - but it is nothing like the slapstick techniques that Robin and Ahchoo use.
<CK|Basara> PRAYING MANTIS?
<Dark92Enigma> JUST DO IT

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Xcoder62> hahahaha,,, i got owned hahahaha
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> damnit i spilt my beer!!!!!
<Vordox> QUICK TRIVIA: Throughout the movie, a mole on the face of Prince John (Richard Lewis) changes position: it starts on his left cheek, then over to his right cheek, then his chin, then his forehead. It then goes back to the original place. This lampoons the mole on Alan Rickman's face in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. It's also a nod to the famous "I-gor's hump" gag from Young Frankenstein.
<Tovler> Didn't both Austin Powers and Love Guru had mole running gags?
<SpeedyBolt> Wow...
<SirGanjalf> Dohoho! That slaps me on the knee! :D
<Midnight_Fyre> Prince John wasn't really that bad. He just gets a bad rap due to the Robin Hood story and a bunch of greedy lords who forced him to sign a document
<SpeedyBolt> Worst fake bad news ever
<RosePetal> John is not amused.
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> Damnit vordox damnit

<Vordox> QUICK TRIVIA: The character played by Joe Dimmick, "Dirty Ezio", was originally written as "Dirty Harry" (Dimmick being a Clint Eastwood look-alike). But on that shooting day, Ezio Greggio, the Italian director, was visiting on the set and Mel Brooks decided to change the killer's name as a joke-homage to his colleague.
<Whirlybird> He was about to shoot him

<Maidwhile> Fillies and Gentlecolts.
<Vordox_in_Tights> QUICK TRIVIA: When the the crowd gives Robin the chop at the archery tournament, this references a tradition at the Florida State University sports matches. The chant is also sung when at FSU games. The chop was also, prior to this film, brought to more focus with the Atlanta Braves baseball fans adopting it to cheer on their team in the League Champion and World Series.

<SparklyWaffles> o-o
<ScootaChicken> Did go through an arm cutting emo MCR listening phase like half a year ago : P
<DocSane> Tovler: It's a very specifically early 20th century upper class accent.
<SpeedyBolt> Smarty Pants
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> lol

<SolairePony89> Methinks Applejack is overreatcting
<TheXIIILightning> Continuity!
<ScootaChicken> So yay I guess.
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Jim. Take care.
<RAWRity> Not ALL americans had that accent. It's a called a "mid-atlantic" accent, since it's not a natural accent, but rather one developed by wealthy americans who would spend long amounts of time in the UK, and thus it became a sort of hybrid of american and UK accents.
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> Jim dream of Ponies
<otakon> WHO THE HAY!
<Ninjazz> ScootaChicken, yay.
<ScootaChicken> Oh wait no, it was a year ago
<Bronysith> night Jim

<Nyst> Oh, yeah that makes more sense.
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> plot
<Ninjazz> Woo~
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<otakon> and then RARITY WANTED TO KILL.
<ScootaChicken> Anyway, bread.
<Shizuka> 13RAWRity: but accents are for poor people
<Celes_Chere> Idle gossip? Or-Bridle gossip.

*Dark92Enigma hugs Pinkie Pie
<tvoie> Hey, I still recognize some of these names!
<TheXIIILightning> We are? XD
<dinky> I was first xD
<Tovler> people in films had that accent. it should have been influential.
*otakon hugs Shizuka "How are you today?"
<Sumica> 00,10dash lost her wings in that pic
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wow dat face
<SpeedyBolt> MY LIFE IS RUINED
<Dark92Enigma> OH MY GOODNESS
<Icanhazponies> lololol
<Maid_Discord> 11,01You got your name in the paper Rainbow!
<otakon> dat look
<RAWRity> its association with the rich is most likely why they chose it for Rarity, as her prim and proper nature is very similar to those of the common mid-atlantic speakers.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Why would a pony need tail extensions...
<Divayth_Fyr> say it
<DocSane> No, you're not! She kinda is!
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> I'LL DESTORY HER!!!
<inkBot> I WILL DESTROY HER!

<Shizuka> 13but
<Ninjazz> Sad Rarity. :c
<Dark92Enigma> ET TU, BOBBY BLABBY----I MEAN GABBY GUMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<hen3ry> Rarity, would you like some hay with your scenery?
<otakon> Seriously, Tabitha St. Germain is one of the BEST VOICE ACTRESSES EVER
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<VioletGreySha> MORNING bronystate ponies :3
<RAWRity> It's also notable that Rarity's accent is an affected one, as neither Sweetie Belle or her parents, nor anyone else in ponyville speaks with it. This also fits her character rather well.
<Shizuka> 13but then we could see a pony doing the zig zag snapping thing
<Quick_Thinker> got to say they put it together petty easily
<CCCP> Ninjazz Rarity isn't sad
<MahBoi777> morning VioletGreySha!
<Maidwhile-Marion> Shizuka: How would they snap?
<Shizuka> 13exactly!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Et tu, Brute?
<otakon> Shizuka: true that would be hilarious, suggest it to MrPoniator
<Ninjazz> CCCP, she was. for like a split second. :T

<CCCP> oh i see
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> halo
<Dark92Enigma> The element of Generosity, everypony <3
<DocSane> RAWRity: Lauren Faust says that her orignal idea for Rarity was for her to speak with a fake British accent.
<SpeedyBolt> Yes.
<inkBot> Oh Rarity :3
<AlienWarhead> Yes
<dinky> YES! "4chan mark"
<AlienWarhead> Maybe
<Ninjazz> Rarity <3
<Riders> I'm out bronies. I've got a hankering for some BBC Robin Hood now. See ya later.

<otakon> bye Riders
<otakon> take care
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> Riders: dream of ponies
<DocSane> I need pictures! Pictures of Mare Do Well!
<Whirlybird> Rarity's accent being fake is a hilarious idea
<fluttercry> 05,15I want pictures! Pictures of SPIDERMAN
<RAWRity> DocSane: I like the mid-atlantic better. Fake brit accent would have made her less "fancy" and more "oh god stop speaking"
<Dark92Enigma> otakon Yes, that too
<PaladinDrunkenwolf> black mail was then canon
<otakon> FEELINGS? FEELINGS ARE FOR NAMBY PAMBY'S!

<Midnight_Fyre> They should just find some incriminating pics of Diamond Tiara
<AlienWarhead> Buck off
<Maidwhile-Marion> Shizuka: Be polite, be efficient, have a plan to kill everypony you meet?
<Irish_Pony> scoota has a wing boner :D
