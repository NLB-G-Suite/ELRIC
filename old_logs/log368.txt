<Fazana> I've seen F1 videos with pony references in
<LunarKing> no it hasn't
<CountDoofus> ... got owned by them too much
<Fazana> F2P TF2 is easy
<Fazana> Becasue all the F2P are nubs and easy to kill
<LunarKing> the place i live in is completley isolated from mlp, except for the mlp that comes on at 6:40 on tv3
<LunarKing> odd
<Fazana> Lol, wrek's a dobbr

<Wrek> 05CANT JOIN :c
<arrowtobroknee> Te only foreign dub I've heard is italian and french
<kieferle_> I'm searching for Jazzy_Hooves ist this the right channel ? Oh, hi by the way
<Jim> I'm norwegian and I haven't heard it o_O
<arrowtobroknee> Hello kieferle_
<CountDoofus> estonian opening theme... kinda weak (sorry)
<mario_pony> LunarKing: they all sound the same and like children
<LunarKing> yea
<DainbowRash> What the hay? Pinkie's ''Lots of fun'' in the opening has been translated to ''Charm of Magic''? :/
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<kieferle_> hi arrowtobroknee
<DainbowRash> In PL version of course.
<Fazana> Liaek cabbag
<LunarKing> as much as i saw in the comments they said that the voice actors were kids of some of our voice actors
<LunarKing> dunno
<LunarKing> i guess it's aimed towards kids cause they don't know about the fanbase yet
<Fazana> "They don't know about the fanbase yet" They don't know, DO THEY EVEN HAVE THE INTERNET!? The first bloody google thing you put in, expect a bloody pony
<LunarKing> dunno, i guess that's just me, they might know
<LunarKing> they might not
<Fazana> Sorry, I kinda spoke my mind there :o
<LunarKing> for some reason the saying that our prime minister said about acta about them eating seeds and not the ones you plant in the ground thing popped into my head
<arrowtobroknee> yay, moar fanfiction
<LunarKing> dunno
<PartyCannon> ooooh Adventure
<CountDoofus> opening theme in french pretty much the same as the polish one, Applejack = heavy smoker
<LunarKing> twilight is made of magic, can she win, uhh i dunno maybe?
<DainbowRash> xD
<Fazana> http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=531088 Lawl
<DainbowRash> Now I found an older version of polish dub. which had almost exact translation. I'm impressed.
<arrowtobroknee> I only know a few people aware of bronies, and that was through the scripted as hell kids react video. I don't think many people outside NA know what bronies are.
<LunarKing> NA?
<Fazana> Dead chat is dead
*PartyCannon knows a ton of UK bronies, and respectfully disagrees
<ScootaChicken> prince-dari: LordCelestia says prince-dari is his true love
<CountDoofus> *crit rocket*
<ScootaChicken> and by prince-dari he means Matt Smith
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<ScootaChicken> thought you'd like to know
<prince-dari> And then any message containing 'Matt Smith' was met with an auto-ignore by my client
<derpy_pony> good evening :)
<ScootaChicken> XD
<ScootaChicken> I love you dari
<Fazana> olololololol
<Cypresswolf> ah, destruction & mayhem :) Just what I need right now
<PartyCannon> prince-dari :3
<CountDoofus> suddenly sniper
<LunarKing> what does NA stand for?
<Vivix> North America
<PartyCannon> North America methinks
<LunarKing> kaay
<LunarKing> SWEET chili sauce :D

<CountDoofus> watching people play games is pleasant
<arrowtobroknee> TF2 is a great spectator sport
<LunarKing> the snow agains my window is being weird
<CountDoofus> oh wow, that song
<Fazana> 'dat song
<Cypresswolf> whats wrong with the snow?
<Fazana> It turns to ice once it has passed
<arrowtobroknee> is there a 13yr old on voice chat?
<Cypresswolf> cool
<Fazana> ice = a bitch
<Fazana> I feel offended
<LunarKing> it's snowing against the window and is making a weird sound
<Fazana> I know many a 13 year old with deepish voices
<Cypresswolf> like wind howling in the crack around a window?
<LunarKing> no
<mario_pony> Fazana: i'm 14 and my voice is berely going thru puberty it squeaks and my friends laugh at me
<LunarKing> like little particles bouncing off my window
<LordCelestia> 0,5HELLO EVERYONE
<Fazana> I'm 15, mine isn't exactly deep, but it ain't high either. Nothing we can control
<Jim> hi lc
<Fazana> Uh oh

<LordCelestia> 0,5No racism. >.>
<arrowtobroknee> Hello LC
<CountDoofus> hiya LordCelestia
<OneTrickPony> Hai LC
<Cypresswolf> freezing rain at the best of times

<Fazana> Yes, your faec
<LunarKing> MY MOUTH IS BURNING
<CountDoofus> anime... not so much :p conventions, depends on what's for sale :)
<mario_pony> oh god heartburn!

<Fazana> The first thing that's even close to a convention is Silverstone for the Brtish Grand Prix this year
<Fazana> Which I'm going
<LunarKing> is snipers pee poisonous?
<Cypresswolf> I tend to attend for new figmas and art auctions. and for the after dark panels :)
<Fazana> Snipahpiss tends to make crits happen
<LunarKing> ahh
<CountDoofus> the only convention in Belgium that's worthwhile is called F.A.C.T.S.
<Fazana> When someone is covered in it, minicrits occur
<Fazana> Which is 1.5x damage
<mario_pony> who here has ever had chili cheese fries from chubby's?
<LunarKing> im REALLY weird for a 16 year old
<Fazana> Don't worry

<Fazana> I'm a closet Brony, if my mates found out, I would be ruined :(
<LunarKing> i found mlp showed my friend, now he's also a brony :D
<arrowtobroknee> same. It's better to be a secret
<mario_pony> Fazana: why if they are your true friends that wouldn't matter to them.
<LunarKing> my other friend doesn't speak english so i didn't even try to show it to him
<Photon-Phoenix> but there's non-english eps
<Fazana> If you know people of this day and age, you wouldn't think that frankly
<LunarKing> yea
<Cypresswolf> May 25 and its local, if you're game, I'll make plans to go
<LunarKing> he's actually one person i wouldn't show it
<CountDoofus> my friends and co-workers know I'm a brony. most of them laugh at it, yet tolerate as well
<Fazana> Spaey
<arrowtobroknee> I'm slowly educating a friend in memes. Eventually I'll show him ponies
<CountDoofus> so... bunch of closet bronies
<LunarKing> am i the only one who actually like red papricca?
<arrowtobroknee> never tried it
<Fazana> Though
<mario_pony> Fazana: everypony in my school knows and they don't care they even get me mlp things sometimes.
<Fazana> I have susptions
<LunarKing> it sweet and juicy
<LunarKing> like an apple
<Wrek> 05love this server cause its brony friendly
<Fazana> I think one of my friends is a closet brony
<arrowtobroknee> I like apples
<LunarKing> whys that?
<arrowtobroknee> Theres loads of brony servers for TF2
<Cypresswolf> My coworkers know Im a brony, took me some 3 months to shut up about it during work hours :)
<Fazana> He makes references every now and then
<Fazana> I try not to :c
<arrowtobroknee> heh, rarity
<Fazana> I remember a science class
<CountDoofus> hmm., May 25th... my flight back home is on 27th from Amarillo. gonna see how far away those two cities are
<LunarKing> try to catch him in the act of being a brony
<Fazana> The teacher was like "Which animals evolved to develop hooves"
<Fazana> He said, "Unicorns and pegasi"
<LunarKing> laugh at him for a good minute and then tell him that you're also a brony, should make things fun
<Cypresswolf> How long are you visiting?
<CountDoofus> 17th till 27th
<mario_pony> who's that girl i hear she sounds HOT.

<ScootaChicken> StinkomanFan: that's quite depressing
<ScootaChicken> anyway
<Wrek> 05a carried a gal out of school all the way to the buss stop cause she twisted her ankle
<StinkomanFan> Not really, all store bought

<Polydunami> ScootaChicken: I'm single and quite available ;)
<ScootaChicken> alexxm: STOP MENTIONING IT ;___;
<StinkomanFan> >Ignored for mod's story of being cooler than me
<alexxm> sorry
<StinkomanFan> This is why I hated valentines
<ScootaChicken> Polydunami: inb4 any possible relationship between us will be illegal due to my underaged'ness
<StinkomanFan> Wish I was one of those poor gunned down saps in Chicago
<Dashie_Dashie|bamman> I love podcasts
<Yahooz> Valentines day at my school, or at least amongst my grade, is kind of a joke :p
<Polydunami> I didn't mean YOU ScootaChicken
<Polydunami> I was talking about irl
<Polydunami> ^__^
<Dashie_Dashie|bamman> Valentines day in general is a joke, to me atleast.
<StinkomanFan> We have a little game around school on Valentines day
<ScootaChicken> Polydunami: I think the same thing will apply
<StinkomanFan> All the girls wear hearts and have to ignore the boys
<Dashie_Dashie|bamman> It's my lifes mission to find a pegasister to be my woman.
<StinkomanFan> If they speak to them they lose 'em
<ScootaChicken> Mostly because I'm 14.
<mario_pony> so am i!
<StinkomanFan> So, it's essentially men trying to flirt with women tenfold
*Dashie_Dashie|bamman zing
<Yahooz> XDDDDD
<WubWubCanary> Holy crap. I hear VOICES.
<Yahooz> this podcast

<Polydunami> I am LOVING this picture so far
<WubWubCanary> And erryone else~
<alexxm> what are the voices telling you to do WubWubCanary
<Polydunami> Partly because Rarity
<StinkomanFan> I once won by asking women out, once they yelled at me they lost it all
<StinkomanFan> <3 Rarity
<RainbowJack> hey Wrek ?
<WubWubCanary> The voices are telling me to be all mushy. And THIS DRAWING WREK.
<CountDoofus> http://countdoofus.deviantart.com/#/d4pq1d0 I so apologize for the baaaadly drawn RBD

<Globetrotter> No
<Fazana> Damn
<ScootaChicken> looks do help, but they aren't the most important thing
<Polydunami> Also, are we describing our own looks now, PonyGirl_82?
<Globetrotter> No it isn't ScootaChickenm it's all about breasts, even if its a bloke, love me some man-boobs
<PonyGirl_82> Well my personality is certified insane :P
<mario_pony> PonyGirl_82: it's what's in the inside that matters

<Deathbat> Wow I'm not sure how to respond to that
<RAINBOWCRASH> CLASH
<RAINBOWCRASH> YES
<RSpanner> Kjakings, you just signed a deathwish
<Kjakings> 7Nobody ever is.
<RAINBOWCRASH> they went fire
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<KwakLad> Does anyone know the game wargasm?
<RAINBOWCRASH> no
<mario_pony> lol
<Kjakings> 7It's my preferred greeting to someone I haven't seen in excess of a month. Nobody ever knows how to respond
<Kjakings> 7The correct response, of course, is 'I got better'
<KwakLad> damn
<Deathbat> ...I see
<KwakLad> oh well
<Shizuka> 13ow.... wreeeek :<
<RSpanner> XD
<Midnight_Tempest> lolz
<Warmachine> heylook at that im back
<Kjakings> 7I'm assuming Yahoo told you about how to get here or it's an extraordinary case of serendipitous timing.
<RAINBOWCRASH> I'm going to play in a concert at 6:00 and I can't wait
<Warmachine> but probably not for long
<RSpanner> She hasn't a clue :L
*Mutterguy might need to redo spy training

<Cavy> Nahh.. I'm not in the closet about Ponies, anyway.
<Kjakings> 7...
<Kjakings> 7fucking mibbit.
<RSpanner> ha
<Cavy> I could care less about what people think of it, so.
<TOY_PON3> Hey everypony happy valentines day :)
<Kjakings> 7I'm not used to this shit any more.
<RSpanner> I'll get it one day
<mario_pony> Cavy: what do your friends think?
<Deathbat> I've only ever watched someone else play Saints Row 2 >.< useless information~
<RSpanner> ONE DAY ;_____;
<RainbowJack> happy vday toy
<mario_pony> hello TOY_PON3!!
<RAINBOWCRASH> happy V-Day
<moop> oh i still havent told my friends i was think tomarrow would work out should i?
<PrototypeX9000> Whats up everypony?
<TOY_PON3> moop :3
<Cavy> Half of em make fun of me. The rest are either Bronies, going to give it a chance eventually, or don't care too much.
<mario_pony> hello PrototypeX9000!!
<KwakLad> Wow lots of people coming on suddenly
<Kjakings> 7SR2 is good. the PC version is a pile of old wrinkled bollocks, but Volition are douches in general to PC gamers
<RAINBOWCRASH> hello
*TOY_PON3 bobs head to music
<KwakLad> Hello those that have just arrived
<RAINBOWCRASH> same here
<Cavy> But the ones that are messing with me tell me it's all in good fun, so.
<Kjakings> 7which is weird, because THQ love us
<Deathbat> Oh my..
*mario_pony does robot
<moop> TOY_PON3: :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 ( i never understood what this face meant)
<RAINBOWCRASH> haha
<RSpanner> :L
<Cavy> Sophomore year is...interesting...
<TOY_PON3> Um okay hi everypony that didn't say hi to me :P
<mario_pony> moop: it's a cat face i think
<RAWRity> so, the Blind Bags I ordered are on their way.
<PrototypeX9000> Hey TOY_PON3
<moop> hi TOY_PON3
<RAINBOWCRASH> no cat/butt face
<RAWRity> Let's hope the US Postal Service doesn't fuck this up.
<Deathbat> Dare I mention Skyrim?
<KwakLad> Hi TOY_PON3
<TOY_PON3> Hi RAWRity :)
<Cavy> Heya TOY_PON3.
<RSpanner> I'm getting comic software soon, so I can finally get crap done.
<mario_pony> awesome song is awesome
<Cavy> U.S. Postal Service <3
<KwakLad> what does sophomore mean?
<moop> mario_pony: nocats have wiskers
<TOY_PON3> Who's streaming?
<RAWRity> Cavy: no. fuck the USPS. so hard.
<RAINBOWCRASH> haha
<Cavy> It's a grade, KwakLad.
<mario_pony> Cavy: didn't they go out of business?
<KwakLad> Wrek is streaming
<TOY_PON3> Cool
<Kjakings> 7Nothing in Skyrim provides me any challenge any more. After Skuldafn whence I bound my favourite spells and weapons to hot keys and mauled my way through every mother fucker in that place fighting things is just a chore.
<RAWRity> mario_pony: almost
<RAINBOWCRASH> be right back
<TOY_PON3> brb lunch
<mario_pony> good to know RAWRity
<Deathbat> Do you play it on PC?
*PrototypeX9000 wondering how one is so good at sniping?
<Cavy> Oh, UPS, RAWRity?
<Kjakings> 7Yeah. Hotkeys.
<RAWRity> due in no small part to the people in charge of the USPS having no clue how to run a fucking business.
<Cypresswolf> my order still says has yet to be shipped. With the less than 3 hour sell out, I can see why they dont update my order status, I just hope it doesnt take any longer than an ebay shipment
<PrototypeX9000> in battlefield i suck
<Cavy> FedEx <3
<Deathbat> Ahh I've only ever played it on PS3
<Kjakings> 7I don't think there's enough buttons for hot keys on a console...
<RAINBOWCRASH> back
<RAWRity> Cavy: anyone other than USPS. They can go fuck themselves after what they did to my mom.
<Cavy> Anyway, Sophomore is basically your second year in High School.
<RAINBOWCRASH> nopony probably cares if i'm back or not
<mario_pony> RAWRity: what did they do?
<TOY_PON3> I wonder if I can join the game..
<Cavy> I only know them as UPS. Never heard USPS, are you not from state-side?
<moop> I CARE
<RainbowJack> whats this song callled?
*PrototypeX9000 cares
<Tarku> ohai RAINBOWCRASH
<RAINBOWCRASH> haha
<Deathbat> I didn't even know what I was doing!! Let alone thinking about hotkeys :|
*TOY_PON3 gives a damn
<RAWRity> Cavy: no, UPS and USPS are 2 different things.
<RAINBOWCRASH> wow well then thanks I guess
<Cavy> I figured. Not entirely sure of the latter, though.
<RAWRity> USPS is the United States Postal Service, and is run by the government.
<RAWRity> UPS is a competing private company.
<Cavy> Ah..Yea.
<mario_pony> AREA 51
<RainbowJack> whats this song called?
<Cavy> Eh, the way this country is being run at the moment, can't blame ya.
<RAINBOWCRASH> YEAH!
<PrototypeX9000> the government must go through ur things to make sure u r smuggling bomb or drugs
<RSpanner> ...stacey you have a ps3?
<Kjakings> 7Late in game becomes annoying if you're a mage. High mana cost of spells combined with low damage means I maxxed my smithing, got myself some dragonscale, a daedric sword double-legendary (97 base damage) with fire damage 31 and absorb health 21 enchantments and the mace of molag bal
<moop> USPS: upper super panda spacerocket
<PrototypeX9000> u r not*
<RAINBOWCRASH> awe massacre ended
<Cavy> Since Regan.
<Deathbat> Nah I played it at Matt's XD
<Deathbat> I only have a PS2.. still >_>
<RainbowJack> anypony know this song?
<Cypresswolf> Who among us hasn't had a fued with thier post office. I've been feuding with mine for years, starting when the person delivering on my street was bending limited matted art prints to stuff in the mailbox.
<Kjakings> 7hey my PS2 is still plugged into my TV
<Deathbat> I have no idea what you're on about Kjakings
<moop> HOLY CRAP I LOOKED UP AREA 51 ON GOOGLE MAPS AND SAW A UFO!!!
<Phase4> moop: no wai
<Cavy> U.S. is fine as is. Just corrupt politicians. A lot of work needs to be done, honestly. But Democracy, unlike communism, can work.
<mario_pony> moop: lol
<Cavy> Anyway, enough with Politics.
<alexxm> give us the link moop
<Deathbat> Still playing good old PS1 games on mine bwahaha
<Cavy> More Ponies.
<RAWRity> mario_pony: my mom worked for the USPS for 20 years, but because she was on limited duty due to an injury sustained on the Job, the essentially said "we have no work for you" and put her out of work. When she applied for disability retirement, they said it would take 3-6 months to process. It took them 19.
<TOY_PON3> brb
<RAINBOWCRASH> what that's funny
<RSpanner> I have a few consoles, but I haven't played a video game in ages
<moop> Phase4: i was trolling
<moop> :P
<Kjakings> 7I switched from playing a mage to playing a melee character, Stacey
<RAINBOWCRASH> brb
<RAWRity> so yeah, FUCK the USPS for everything they're worth.
<PrototypeX9000> r u 19?
<TOY_PON3> Wait is the server full?
<Phase4> moop: i was joking :P
<RSpanner> last thing I played was probably animal crossings or the sims 3 :L
<Deathbat> Haven't wii'd for a while.. hmm hmm
<Deathbat> Ah right
<Kjakings> 7you should get that checked out
<moop> Phase4: i know what you did last summer
<RSpanner> unless iphone apps count XD
<Deathbat> XD!
*PrototypeX9000 is just kidding
<rainbro> Actually.
<Cavy> RAWRity, no offense to your mom, but in reality, our Govenment thinks their are more important things to handle than your mom's retirement.
<RainbowJack> what was that song called?
<rainbro> I'll be back later.
<Cavy> It sucks, but that's their mindset.
<Phase4> moop: sit around in my underpants and browse the internet?
*TOY_PON3 wonders if the server is full
<RSpanner> omg, izzy's been going apeshit about me posting my status about my dad watching twilight :L
<Phase4> moop: its what i'm doing this summer too
<rainbro> Nah.

<PrototypeX9000> what a lag...
<rainbro> It's fine.
<RAWRity> Cavy: the government isn't in charge of what I'm talking about.
<Deathbat> Fabulous!
<moop> Phase4: how do you know? its in the future bye then the world could be taken over by Parasprites

<prince-dari> >dat old pokemon thing
<RSpanner> I HAVE A PHOTO OF KIERAN FOR YOU.
<TOY_PON3> Shizuka: Is the server full?
<rainbro> At least I think I am. :3
<Cavy> Not entirely educated on how that works.
<prince-dari> I remember that.
<Shizuka> 13le nope
<Kjakings> 7Bitch you need to register this channel- I WILL END YOU BITCHWHORE
<PrototypeX9000> i am looking at the stream correctly...is it really lagging that bad?
<moop> Phase4: your joking right its the middle of winter here !

<Shizuka> 13guys it's 13 people on a residential line .-.
<prince-dari> Long time no see guys.
<Phase4> moop: Australia mate
<rainbro> It might be because I'm only on the IRC channel and not the stream.
<Cavy> You're stuck here...FOREVER..
<RSpanner> kieran, you shouldn't ahve reminded me of him! XD
<Kjakings> 7*ahem* You need to register this channel, make it into a city of the bronystate

<moop> Phase4: I always wanted to go there
<prince-dari> ... Kjakings, you have to be shitting me, because I'm admin at a site called bronystate.

<RAINBOWCRASH> I'm going to be forever alone at this rate I'm to shy to talk to random people

<Athena> Uh guys... What happend when I was gone -~-
<TOY_PON3> moop: I know lol and yeah technically by law it is
<rainbro> I'm 17 and I see no appeal in 7 year olds.
<flutterSpin> Just because a 16 year old wants to be with a 21 year old doesn't make it right.
<moop> but the 17 year old is underage
<fillyfillyy> i think its still illegal though (of age person X under age person)
<TOY_PON3> Athena: I have no idea! *Medic voice*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well guys, See ya later~ Happy V-Day or love day or whatevers~ lova you all<3

<meh> that guy was blue
<Mutterguy> moop try using tab with names. a lot easire

<moop> i don't see any thing wrong with a 25 year old watching MLP FIM
<Mutterguy> *easier
<flutterSpin> Some countries 18 is legal limit, 17 with consent. 16 I think some countries may have some problem with it.
<TOY_PON3> ^
<fluttercry> 05,15woah, why are we talking about age of consent?
<meh> i know some countries where its like 12
<Athena> I dunno fluttercry~

<Phase4> fluttercry: i just tabed back and first thing i read was your line
<TOY_PON3> lol
<fillyfillyy> ummm TOY_PON3 im 15 i think one of my friends with a 20 year old is weird

<rainbro> Now wut?
<Rainbow> Fact: I'm a brony, not pegasister
<paradise92> soo guys quick question...i want to start streaming some random game...on which site should i stream (by which i mean twitch.tv and those kind of games) ??
<Cavy> Anyway, article I read was by Faust and basically commented on any steriotypes in the show.
<Yahooz> livestream
<Yahooz> keep it simple
*fillyfillyy blushes at rainbro
<Cavy> Ie: Rainbow Dash and her sexuality. It was quite interesting.
<rainbro> :3
<moop> theres a person at school and i can tell if it is a girl or a boy
<Cavy> http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/24/my-little-non-homophobic-non-racist-non-smart-shaming-pony-a-rebuttal/
<mario_pony> Cavy: go on

<Kabaka> Mutterguy: what
<Cavy> I'll quote it, if you like.
<fillyfillyy> TopHat: i landed on you in Yahooz game

<Rainbow> I'm gonna look for ponies
<Rainbow> Buh bte
<Mutterguy> n'awww
<Cavy> "Rainbow Dash has rainbow-striped hair because of her name and because she is very interested in sports, specifically flying. She is a tomboy, but nowhere in the show is her sexual orientation ever referenced. As we all know, there are plenty of straight tomboys in the world, and assuming they are lesbians is extremely unfair to both straight and lesbian tomboys."- Faust
<Rainbow> See you in 10 seconds flat
<Cavy> Sorry about the wall.

<rainbro> ...
<rainbro> Moop?
<rainbro> RAWRity?
<moop> yes?
<fluttercry> 05,15It would start Derpy, and involve Lyra and Bon Bon shipping
<rainbro> :D
<RAWRity> ya?
<Phase4> RAWRity: that could work either extreemly well or extreemly badly
<rainbro> I was getting ignored.
<fluttercry> 05,15star *
<Mutterguy> maybe only as a last hurrah episode
<rainbro> So I thought I was invisible.
<Metalrainbowdashchan> awwwww rainbro :(
<rainbro> Thanks guys.
<RAWRity> fluttercry: it would litereally be nothing but shouting memes at the audience.
<moop> sorry rainbro
<Cypresswolf> :)...there wouldnt be enough kid friendly content to air a 22 minute episode, moop
<Metalrainbowdashchan> everyone gives lots of love to rainbro :) <3
<moop> i think im always invisible so i say BOO! to scare people
<moop> Cypresswolf: but it would still be hilarious

*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames, then is hit with a train
<Mutterguy> :(
<Mutterguy> Medic!!!
<moop> :$ nopony ever uses this face
<RAWRity> generally speaking, letting fans take over a show doesn't end well, ebcause they latch onto certain things that THEY think are important, and ignore other elements that make the show what it is. That's what's happened with later seasons of the Simpsons. New writers being brought onto the show had a different idea of what the show should be after watching it, and it suffered in quality as a result.
<mario_pony> your face!
*Mutterguy runs to see if he's going to be ok

<TOY_PON3> LadyCanary|yay: Same here
<Placebo> LadyCanary|yay: Testing the water, as it were? :D
<MahBoi777> hey Phase4|Reading
<Phase4|Reading> ohai MahBoi777
<LadyCanary|yay> Exactly.
<NullRadix> killed is a harsh term, maybe you should go with "Mortally Distracted"
<StinkomanFan> Long story short mine went a LOT better than any other one
<TOY_PON3> Placebo you're not mad that I kissed another pony :(
<Placebo> TOY_PON3: I'm happy for ya, bro.

<MahBoi777> not bad.
<TOY_PON3> I couldn't afford some fancy restuarant :(
<Placebo> But I mean, you can't always take 'em to a 3 star restraunt.
<StinkomanFan> I've seen worse dates
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey, if she liked it, isn't that all that matters?
<Placebo> Better to see the real you off the bat, then spend 3 months getting to know a fake you, IMO.
<MahBoi777> ^^
<StinkomanFan> One couple was shot to death on one date
<StinkomanFan> Of course that couple was Bonny and Clyde
<Placebo> ^ Most unspecific homocide ever.
*TOY_PON3 is not sure to feel bad or sad
<Placebo> StinkomanFan: My Gf's great uncle (or something like that) Was one of the cops that caught and killed Bonny and Clyde.
<Everlasting_Joy> TOY_PON3 if you believe everything went well, feel happy instead.

<RAINBOWCRASH> I'm so freakin sad right now
<Sumica> 00,10did you at least set priortys to first eps?

<Kencolt> The bartender is now confused at the wide array of drinks, but serves the pony, who drinks, pays and starts to leave. But he's cuirous now.
<Midnight_Tempest> Shizuka... can you give me a hint as to what it is... through PM of course ^_^
<Mutterguy> helping with dishes, back sooon

<Hodiku> is it... gargoyles?
<Polydunami>
<TOY_PON3> ...
<Kencolt> And the pony replies- "Well, I've had a hard day. I NEEDED those drinks. You try to keep up with Twilight Sparkle sometime. And as for why they are all different, well..."
<Shizuka> 13thought sumica streamed gargoyles... and finished it
<Hodiku> oh
<Shizuka> 13or somepony was
<Midnight_Tempest> what... AND I MISSED IT! T___T *suicides*
<TheWyrm> Hello! Any pony artists around looking to make some quick cash? I'm hiring artists for some sketch comics, pay is per panel and in advance. Message me if you'd like to learn the details.
<Kencolt> "Corn. Barley. Rice. Wheat. The four basic food groups. I promised my mother i'd eat a serving of each every day."
<Polydunami> Just as planned ^__^
<Kencolt> 'Ba-dum-swwish.
<TOY_PON3> Kencolt: SWAG
<Sumica> 00,10You are welcome to stream any thing I ahve streamed Shizuka
<Ingwaz> RAINBOWCRASH: i get what you mean, it can get pretty lonesome sometimes. but, look at it this way, when you're without someone, its an opportunity to improve yourself. its hard to put in to words. Just because you dont have somepony now, does not mean you cannot in the future. The times of waiting will make it all the more important to you for when you do have somepony as well
<Midnight_Tempest> wall o' text
<TOY_PON3> dat wall of text
<Polydunami> Wait, whiskey comes from corn? Didn't know that
<Midnight_Tempest> whiskey is delicious
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Midnight_Tempest> so is scotch
<Shizuka> 13that's why they call it corn whiskey .-.
<Kencolt> Yes. yes it doesn except for rey whiskey.
<Midnight_Tempest> and bourbon
<MahBoi777> cider cider cider cider
<RAINBOWCRASH> yes but I'm shy and can't really communicate so...
<Midnight_Tempest> and vodka... rum... tequila...
*TOY_PON3 likes alcohol instead of beer
<Ingwaz> i have a habit of posting walls o' text i've noticed
<Kencolt> Ok.. the joke didn't fly, I guess...
<Polydunami> I like brandy myself
<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Tempest: You and me should go out for a drink sometime ^^
<Midnight_Tempest> yes
<Midnight_Tempest> yes we must
<TOY_PON3> :)
<RAINBOWCRASH> and I've improved my pesonality as best as I could except for the being shy part
<Midnight_Tempest> i will drink you under the table TOY_PON3
<Ingwaz> RAINBOWCRASH: not something necessarily wrong with that. you can work through that, or you can choose to be that. Nothing necessarily wrong with being shy
<TOY_PON3> <3
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Kencolt> All I see, by the way, is a pixelated Celestia. Who looks surprised. Guess we're still waiting on something.
<Ingwaz> theres a special somepony out there for you, the hard part is the waiting
<Genericblue> hello everypony, i see there is a new broadcast window
<Genericblue> i like the refresh button
<PrototypeX9000> Whazzup Everypony!
<Midnight_Tempest> TOY_PON3: remember when I said I stayed up for 4 days straight... I was drinking 80% of that whole stretch
<MahBoi777> I can't wait for da sax music
<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Tempest: Wow o.o
<Midnight_Tempest> it was fabulous
<RAINBOWCRASH> It's hard to talk to someone about to help when you're to shy to talk to someone ecpecially since this world is full of jerks and such
<TOY_PON3> yay more Futurama
<Midnight_Tempest> too QUIET!
<MahBoi777> huzzah!
<TOY_PON3> well I'm gonna go shower brb
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: Deja Vu :D
<MahBoi777> LOL
<otakon> huzzah moar Futurama
<otakon> lol
<Polydunami> Oh god
<TheDr> well goodnight you guys :)
<Polydunami> Zapp
<otakon> ohg od WHY!?
<PrototypeX9000> Goodnight TheDr
<otakon> night TheDr sleep well
<Polydunami> SO HOT!!!
<Polydunami> ^__^
<Ingwaz> RAINBOWCRASH: there are indeed a lot of jerks, but there are good people as well. its the good people that make it worth it. And just because you have trouble talking doesnt mean anything. speech alone isnt the only method of communication. Not everypony wants a talker for their special somepony. Some ponies like a talker like pinkie pie, some ponies like a shy one like fluttershy
<MahBoi777> gnight TheDr take care
<TOY_PON3> moar wall o text
<Polydunami> Goodnight Doctor
<TOY_PON3> Night TheDr
<Ingwaz> better get used to it toy_pon3, i do that a lot it seems
<Midnight_Tempest> i want an angry dome
<PrototypeX9000> I guess i'm a fluttershy
<otakon> dat dome o anger
<RAINBOWCRASH> that doesn't help me any but thanks
<Polydunami> Personality test says I'm Rainbow Dash
<Polydunami> wut
<TOY_PON3> Ingwaz: I don't mind you're a good consulant
<TOY_PON3> ^^
<RAINBOWCRASH> same here but i'm more of fluttershy
<TOY_PON3> consultant*
<Ingwaz> RAINBOWCRASH: What i'm basically trying to say is. you need to be okay with yourself. Theres nothing wrong with being shy. Some people seriously do prefer the shy ones over the talkative ones.
<Ingwaz> do you consider yourself an empathetic person rainbowcrash?
<PrototypeX9000> The shy people are normally the nicer people
<RAINBOWCRASH> I am ok with myself but I'm always sad on hearts and hooves day
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Ingwaz> or the crazy ones prototypex9000
<Kencolt> BBl-- I need to check a few things.
*TOY_PON3 is crazy
<TOY_PON3> :3

<Mutterguy> and i'm back!
<TOY_PON3> welcome back Mutterguy
<otakon> see ya later Kencolt
<Ingwaz> it does kind of suck rainbowcrash, felt that a few times today. But, just look towards the future rather than being condemned by your past

<PrototypeX9000> im just saying everyone i know...
*Midnight_Tempest turns into a pony and gallops aroudn the chat
<Ingwaz> wished i lived in equestria, for various reasons, one of which is to hang out with pinkie pie
*TOY_PON3 hops on Midnight_Tempest and rides him

<Midnight_Tempest> Sumica: im pretty sure the have coffee in equestria... but if not, take some coffee beans with you in case
<Sumica> 00,10I dont like coffiee, I prefer my caffeene cold
<TOY_PON3> Ingwaz: I usually make things awkward just to mess with the other ponies ^^

<otakon> Polydunami: he's streaming
<herostar> dat sewer
<Kencolt> It's really a close adaptaion tothe radio show. (Which at the moment, I do not have.)

<MahBoi777> stick yo finger down his throat?
<otakon> a drink OUT of a Vogon
<Kencolt> One of teh great scenes.
<Polydunami> Kind of jumpy, ennem?
<MahBoi777> mmmmm tasty
<otakon> um
<Ingwaz> that looks horrible...
<PrototypeX9000> um...
<otakon> blue twinkie with green paste?
<MahBoi777> it's an aquired taste
<otakon> apparently
<Ingwaz> ewwww
<herostar> LOL
<otakon> the Vintrassi
<Polydunami> So who's the main guy, if I may ask?
<otakon> hmm, don't remember them from the book tbh
<otakon> Arthur Dent
<otakon> the one in the robe
<Polydunami> Oh
<Polydunami> Right
<otakon> and Ford, the one in the pinstripe suit
<MahBoi777> robe beats suit
<otakon> so stunguns no good?
<Kencolt> The things about Dent is, he spends most of the series-- TV, Radio, and novels-- in a state of Not-qite there outrage and has every reason to do so. Oh, and he's probably the most important person in the universe, but...
<otakon> I'd take one for sure
<otakon> Kencolt: nice
<PrototypeX9000> dem sound effects
<Kencolt> Well, it's TRUE.
<otakon> so this is all JUNK to him?
<Ingwaz> lol
<otakon> no serioulsy
<MahBoi777> I'd take the psychic helmet
<Polydunami> I'm liking this so far
<Polydunami> dat towel
<otakon> I's take a stun gun
<otakon> do you
<herostar> i have a towell...

<Ingwaz> dont forget to bring a towel
<MahBoi777> take him out!
<herostar> i sleep with it cause it inspired me
<otakon> dem babel fish
<MahBoi777> put a fish in ur ear, lol
<Kencolt> Ford does know what he's talking about. Everyone else tendsto get a bit puzzled. Except Zaphod, who is kind of perma-puzzled anyway, but he's not aware of it.
<Mutterguy> there are many towels, but this onne is mine
<herostar> i want that fish!!!
<MahBoi777> eet is so tiny! eez funneh to me
<PrototypeX9000> u can uderstand anything people say that would be awesome
<otakon> crap

<Saturn> 08,01so, finally submnitted my essay
<Saturn> 08,018 hours late...
<Polydunami> Oh
<herostar> SuperBronie64
<Kencolt> You.. You didn't? Wow. It was a six episode TV epic, and was a genuine classic.
<otakon> Saturn: good on ya though
<Saturn> 08,018% i lost for tardiness
<otakon> Kencolt: enope
<Saturn> 08,01but at least it's done.
<herostar> SuperBrony64 next film....
<Ingwaz> only 8% lost, thats not so bad
<otakon> Saturn: it'll be fine, not a full A but it'll be fine
<Saturn> 08,01i like writing essays, except when i leave them to the last minute like this
<otakon> Saturn: don't do it again you silly Scot.
<herostar> SuperBrony64 you there?
<MahBoi777> SuperBrony64 needs tacos now
<otakon> hmmm
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i can still get an A, theoretically
<Kencolt> Didn't cover all the radio eps-- but did wind up selfcontained. With Scrbble.
<otakon> true, but I doubt your professor is that generous
<MahBoi777> Taco Time is completely understandable
<otakon> hmmm
<Polydunami> Well, SuperBrony63, is it an intermission or what?
<otakon> did he say he was going to get tacos?
<Saturn> 08,01also.. i kinda answered the essay question by saying "the essay question is meaningless"
<Saturn> 08,01which it was.
<Saturn> 08,01so f[yay]k that.
<Kencolt> What was the essay question?
<MahBoi777> otakon: he ALWAYS needs tacos, it's fuel
<otakon> indeed
<otakon> also
<PrototypeX9000> Don't diss the tacos...
<otakon> why did Vi go from Birthday to Empty?
<otakon> isn't Empty bad?
<Saturn> 08,01"Hacking and the unauthorised publication of private information have caused numerous shocks to society recently. Should these practices be encourages or discouraged, and why?@
<TOY_PON3|Zzz> otakon: I wonder..
<Saturn> 08,01it's a meaningless question, because it depends on context
<PrototypeX9000> which do you prefer soft or hard tacos?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm going to get such a bad mark for this essay...

<Polydunami> Hello there secrets

<PartyCannon> inb4 breach of confidentiality :D
<Kencolt> Well... I kind of thought that was the best way to answer...
<The_4th_Wall> Obviously they have the horn of the Unicorn, and The wings of a Pegasus, but do they have the strength/unusual dexterity of the Earth Ponies?
<MahBoi777> TOP SECRET??
<Kencolt> You liked it?
<Avillion> don don don

<MahBoi777> oh Top secret folder, what do you hold?
<Kencolt> Let me say this-- I do NOT want to get into a hoof-fight withe SCelestia.
<Mutterguy> *prowess
<The_4th_Wall> OH!
<Midnight_Tempest> minecraft... on noes...
<Polydunami> Here we go
<Polydunami> ...
<MahBoi777> minecraft
<PartyCannon> Ingots!
<Simon> Minecaft!
<diddutz> silly filly server O.o?
<MahBoi777> LOL
<The_4th_Wall> I wanna see a QR code show up on some Equestrian post or something like that on an episode
<Midnight_Tempest> and hes stuck
<MahBoi777> lol Simon, that was fast
<Polydunami> Hey ehrenthedragon, need a hand?
<Kencolt> But in general, the two known Alicorns-- Celastia and Luna-- are generally accepted in Fanon to epitomise the perfection of all three tribes. Faust, however says... They are a mystery. unknown, unexplainable...
<Polydunami> dem alicorns
<Polydunami> Such enigmas
<Placebo> Minecraft.
<Placebo> And my entire page crashed..
<Midnight_Tempest> she added the Alicorn because there was one in the G1 series of MLP
<Kencolt> In other words, we're NEVER going to get ANYBUCKING CANON about them. They just ARE.
<Polydunami> I love mystery in a mare ;)
<Placebo> Arguing about Alicorns?
<MahBoi777> the inner mechanisms of my mind are an enigma...
<Kencolt> Because they are Celestia and Luna. And we just have to deal.
<The_4th_Wall> LAUREN! Y U NO DEBRIEF ALICORNS?!?!
<MahBoi777> SB is frozen! quick get a heater!
<Polydunami> I can't decide if I like Celestia or Luna more
<Midnight_Tempest> in other words MahBoi777... the wheel is turning but the hamster is dead, right?
<Placebo> Wub woona :3
<MahBoi777> Midnight_Tempest: precisely
<Polydunami> I'm going to say yes on that one
<The_4th_Wall> niether can i
<Polydunami> ^__^
<MahBoi777> lol
<Midnight_Tempest> you know... i would play minecraft... if it wasn't so UNGODLY BORING!
<MahBoi777> teh silliness
<The_4th_Wall> Luna's adorable, but Celly feels...
<Kencolt> We're not supposed to know. We're not EVER supposed to know. They are Magical Princesses. That's all we NEED To know. And all they are likely ever to tell us.
<Polydunami> Boring? Really?
<The_4th_Wall> I kind of wanna say motherly.
<Midnight_Tempest> i find it boring
<Simon> game crash?
<diddutz> hax!
<Polydunami> Chunk error still?
<MahBoi777> it's beautiful
<Polydunami> THERE we go
<MahBoi777> Minecart racing!
<Kencolt> It's basically, Celestia can do whatever she wants-- unless it's the Element thing. And Luna can do pretty much the same-- although, I suspect, only with Celly's OK. Kinda on probation, but she seems OK with that.
<Mutterguy> server details?
<MahBoi777> fasten your seatbelts
<Polydunami> It's gonna be a bumpy ride
<Kencolt> Harmony is a greater power than even Celestia... but it seems it has found it's proper champions. Who, well... can be idiots, but that's kind of the point.
