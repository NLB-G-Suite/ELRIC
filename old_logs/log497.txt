<Spell-of-Gaming> Not a fan of the old Avatar.
<maid_killerpony7733> *dusts everyone*

*Spell-of-Gaming sneezes
*ponibas goes off to find Pigpen
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> You know what? I guess I'm not the only one who complains about the stuff that comes on the stream. But frankly, I'm not into Avatar. I might've been if I'd been around for the first episode. But continuity fails me.
<Skylands> 10Too much effort
<Comet> Damn zuko you scary
<Maid_Ponies47> Dusts Spell-of-Gaming

<drfsupercenter> 03I don't want them catching onto me LOL
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh boy here we go
<Barbetos> Zuko why not, oh I dunno, ask for some?
<Azuredragon> Does Avatar count as Anime?
<Comet> No women no children
*Maid_Edge dusts cachi_maid01
<cachi_maid01> Azuredragon: no
<Om-cookin> This is a good one.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Azuredragon: no
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> is anime on?
<CK|GW2> And that's how Zuko dies. :D
<drfsupercenter> 03no but anyway, fillitem can help if you just want the free slow shipping
*cachi_maid01 can bend dust
<ponibas> <- Not that particularly into it to care

<Bronysith> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: its a chocobo
<Bronysith> Kandarihu|BuddyBear: trololo
<drfsupercenter> 03weeeeeell

<Comet> I wanna watch thunder cats
<drfsupercenter> 03if your dad wasn't so paranoid I'd offer to add you as a shared-Prime-benefits account
