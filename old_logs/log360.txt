<Wrek> 05-.-
<Simon2> minecrafting
<Armageddon> 'night
<MirrorImage> yes, because you haven't beat minecraft if you haven't made a 1:1 scale model of ponyville
<tematric> and the moon
<Simon2> playing with my friends, do not care about the ending atm
<Phase4|NodeJS> microsoftemail.com << appears to be a scam domain, they just sent me two emails informing me of kinect for windows
<MirrorImage> ...and you're telling us this why?
<Phase4|NodeJS> two of exactly the same email
<Simon2> warning?
<Simon2> can't find the websit4e
<Phase4|NodeJS> donou, its 00:27. stuff seems important for some reason
<Simon2> *website
<MirrorImage> it's 08:27 here
<Phase4|NodeJS> lucky
<Simon2> 21:28
<Simon2> Phase4|NodeJS: I just realized when normal pony streams are up, it's 2:00am in your area
<Simon2> do you stay up or sleep?
<Phase4|NodeJS> stay up
<Phase4|NodeJS> its why i'm up now, adjusting a little for tomorow
<Phase4|NodeJS> today
<Phase4|NodeJS> tomorow
<Phase4|NodeJS> not a clue, to late for brain
<Phase4|NodeJS> early?
<Phase4|NodeJS> *derp*
<MirrorImage> surprised you didn't just get dari-trolled there
<Simon2> 6 messeges in 10 seconds = kick
<MirrorImage> yes, but lag tends to make it where it's more like 6/20 or 6/30
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<MirrorImage> otakon seems really good at getting unneccessary dari-kicks
<Phase4|NodeJS> maby its a super lag and i will get kicked by this lin
<Phase4|NodeJS> line'
<Phase4|NodeJS> hyh
<Phase4|NodeJS> huh'
<Simon2> why will dari lag?
<Dark_Horst> stream still paused?
<Phase4|NodeJS> just does
<MirrorImage> not sure, but the kick is based on the timestamps on dari's local machine
<MirrorImage> so if it lags and he gets a bunch of messages as a group
<Phase4|NodeJS> dari netsplits are allways fun
<Phase4|NodeJS> instakicks half the chat
<MirrorImage> then a set of messages that to us have a 20-second gap may have been held up and reach dari in a 5 second gap instead
<MirrorImage> yeah...
<MirrorImage> which is why i've been telling him his script needs more leeway
<Phase4|NodeJS> whats with the joins?
<Phase4|NodeJS> streams dead here
<ScootaChicken> hai thar guys :3
<MirrorImage> the british are coming the british are coming!
<MirrorImage> wait... you guys are all going to sleep right now, aren't you?
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<HeavyMetalDash> eeeenope
<MirrorImage> no... that's australia
<Kammerjunk> Nope.
<ScootaChicken> the British are coming?
<Kammerjunk> It's 14:35 here.
<ScootaChicken> Yes. Yes we are.
<MirrorImage> yeah, early afternoon
<Simon2> color/colour

<HeavyMetalDash> lol ogawd
<Kammerjunk> Get your minds out of the gutter.
<ScootaChicken> in every city and every town
<MirrorImage> inb4 wrek comes back and wonders wat the eff we're doing
<HeavyMetalDash> where else am I supposed to put my mind?
<Kammerjunk> The Swedish are coming?
<Jim> Brace yourself
<ScootaChicken> oh HeavyMetalDash I added you on skype
<Kammerjunk> HeavyMetalDash: In a fine suit and a top hat.
<ScootaChicken> my mind is in both.
<HeavyMetalDash> nice!!!
<Wrek> 05...
<ScootaChicken> my top hat is in fact, also a gutter.
<MirrorImage> "Hello my baby! Hello my darlin'! Hello my rag time gal~!"
<HeavyMetalDash> |I want a top hat now though
<Simon2> dat Wrek
<MirrorImage> ohai wrek
<Phase4|NodeJS> hai ScootaChicken
<ScootaChicken> suddenly Wrek
<ScootaChicken> oh god
<Kammerjunk> I wish I knew where to buy top hats.
<HeavyMetalDash> me too...
<Phase4|NodeJS> i leave for a bit and the chat starts without me
<MirrorImage> a costume store at a minimum
<MirrorImage> failing that, ebay
<HeavyMetalDash> but I want a nice one
<Phase4|NodeJS> what do you meen 'suddenly Wrek'?
<HeavyMetalDash> I want a freindship top hat
<ScootaChicken> Wrek showed up
<MirrorImage> yeah, wrek came back 2 minutes ago
<ScootaChicken> and then went back to lurking
<Kammerjunk> The Swedish -are- coming!
<MirrorImage> 07[08:36:10] <Wrek> 05...01
<Mortyirc> suddenly i need to watch the new episode
<MirrorImage> errr...
<MirrorImage> did that post in color?
<Jim> Resist that urge Mortyirc
<ScootaChicken> yes.
<ScootaChicken> Yes it did MirrorImage.
<MirrorImage> whoops
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<Jim> There's not long until satudray
<MirrorImage> didn't realize my clipboard pulled formatting
<Simon2> wait MirrorImage...
<Simon2> color?
<MirrorImage> i'm not using the BronyState client
<Simon2> how
<Simon2> ?
<MirrorImage> and id on't know - i just copy/pasted a line
<MirrorImage> and evidently it preserved formatting, including color
<Mortyirc> but this was the second quality fic i posted to fimfiction and no feature and bs like sundude and moonbro and a fic about trixie and Twi as lobsters get featured
<Mortyirc> its very discouraging
<Jim> Lobsters?
<Mortyirc> yes lobsters
<ScootaChicken> lobsters.
<Wrek> 05so bored...
<ScootaChicken> dear god.
<Simon2> Sweetie Belle - I'm so bored
<ScootaChicken> Wrek, you have an internet connection, and probably tissues.
<ScootaChicken> you know what to do.
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Phase4|NodeJS> wtf is happening here? every time i tab out a page of chat goes by while i'm not looking
<Mortyirc> im hoping it was just the awkawrd timeslot i got at 4 am eastern time, but i doubt it
<Phase4|NodeJS> must lose track of time when i'm tired
<Wrek> 05nah... dont feel like cloppin' scoot
*MirrorImage chooses to miss the point obviously
<MirrorImage> MicTheMicrophoneZero is going to do a dramatic reading of My Little Dashie
<ScootaChicken> meh.
<MirrorImage> that would qualify ScootaChicken
<Jim> Oh my
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Goddesses.
<Mortyirc> i dislike the EqD people
<Simon2> 3 screens, 1-Minecraft, 2-This & 3-TV
<Mortyirc> they are kind of jerks
<ScootaChicken> I'm at school so I don't have the boredom relieving abilities some do.
<Simon2> watching TVB pearl now, the movie is weird atm
<MirrorImage> such as... nah, not going there
<ScootaChicken> MictheMicrophone seems like a bit of a douche...
<Wrek> 05probably gona catch up my missed zero punctuation vids
<Wrek> 05then maybe play i dunno... wow or rift or any other mmo...
<Mortyirc> Scootachicken: he really is
<ScootaChicken> Mortyirc: I don't know too much about him, I've only listened to a couple of his songs and heard the drama about the episode stream donations
<Simon2> Wrek: can I add you on steam as friend?
<ScootaChicken> what other stuff has he done?
<Mortyirc> what drama would this be?
<Phase4|NodeJS> !cd
<Tom> Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 1 days, 1 hours, 46 minutes, 21 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)
<Phase4|NodeJS> :3
<Simon2> dat Tom
<Wrek> 05sure
<ScootaChicken> Mortyirc: he said he has a copy of the new episode that was leaked and would livestream it if he got donations so he could fly to BronyCon
<Mortyirc> -_-
<ScootaChicken> seems legit.
<Phase4|NodeJS> that sounds quite ilegal
<ScootaChicken> apparently he raised over a thousand dollars
<Phase4|NodeJS> this stream you could fudge through cause of the ads, he's directly asking for money
<ScootaChicken> although that's probably an exaggeration
<MirrorImage> ScootaChicken - $1700
<Lasharus> That's... insanely stupid.
<ScootaChicken> Christ...
<MirrorImage> evidently there were a handful of $100+ donations
<Lasharus> Humanity never fails to depress, doesn't it?
<Lasharus> *does it
<ScootaChicken> people evidently really like him...
<MirrorImage> hang on; he's posted videos about this
<ScootaChicken> I honestly can't see why
<Wrek> 05i'd hit im in the faic
<Phase4|NodeJS> inb4 the fbi raids his place
<Jim> People like him, but he shouldn't abuse his position by asking for donations
<ScootaChicken> I mean, he's an alright rapper but he's hardly the greatest brony musician
<Mortyirc> and whenever Mic livestreams he's such a dick
<Lasharus> Nah, SOPA didn't get passed. :P
<ScootaChicken> he doesn't even write his own instrumentals
<MirrorImage> alright, well evidently he's deleted the one video i was going to post
<ScootaChicken> MirrorImage: I'm at school, can't access videos
<Mortyirc> like one time he was making fun of this kid who insisted that he be a rolemodel for the brony community
<ScootaChicken> well, I can go onto youtube, but I can't listen to anything
<MirrorImage> Mortyirc - have you read the Fallout Equestria fics?
<ScootaChicken> Mortyirc: if the kid was being all high and mighty and generally douchebaggery about it I don't see what the problem is
<bear2229> hello\
<MirrorImage> ...
<MirrorImage> SPEAK of the devil...
<Dashie_Dashie> *sigh*
<Lasharus> That... was kinda freaky.
<ScootaChicken> daribot knows...
<Lasharus> No Dashie_Dashie, nothing to do with you. :P
<Dashie_Dashie> I just spent 8 hours of my sleep time repairing my xbox.
<Lasharus> Ouch.
<Dashie_Dashie> @_@
<MirrorImage> the questions stands though Mortyirc - have you read FoE?
<ScootaChicken> oh dear...
<Dashie_Dashie> Finally got my disc drive to work again.
<Mortyirc> Mirrorimage: Not yet
<HeavyMetalDash> huzzah!
<MirrorImage> well, there's your opportunity right there
<Jim> So much daribot
<Wrek> 05seriously this community has way too many douchebags
<HeavyMetalDash> meh
<Dashie_Dashie> what Wrek?
<Phase4|NodeJS> looks like a fanfic day for eqd
<Lasharus> Doesn't every community Wrek?
<Wrek> 05"top famous" people that is
<Lasharus> Oh, I see.
<pony_6109u> i agree
<MirrorImage> that's because we tend to cling on new material, and said 'douchebags' are the ones that pump out the most content
<Lasharus> Eh, that'll always happen.
<Simon2> like "first" commentor?
<Dashie_Dashie> I really need a gaming PC.. I don't want to spend another 8 hours fixing my xbox again -__-
<xcanox> "walks over to the walmart cashier and pulls out a gun, give me the ponies or somebody is gonna die"
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<HeavyMetalDash> I need more ponies!
<ScootaChicken> mind you, quite a few famous Brony musicians are pretty cool people
<ScootaChicken> AcousticBrony and Mandopony to name a few
<Jim> true ScootaChicken
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<ScootaChicken> although I don't really follow the drama about famous bronies that much
<Dashie_Dashie> MrPoniator is best famous pony.
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<ScootaChicken> I liek MrPoniator
<Lasharus> I don't much like his vids, if I'm honest.
<Dashie_Dashie> at least your honest lol
<HeavyMetalDash> they're okay
<Jim> I think he does a great job
<Simon2> Mrponiatoris sometimes good sometimes weird
<ScootaChicken> school and whatnot
<ScootaChicken> see ya
<Lasharus> I don't really like sexjokes. And most of his vids are sexjokes. :P
<ScootaChicken> I'm gonna go now guys
<Jim> Have fun ScootaChicken
<HeavyMetalDash> later Scoots
<ScootaChicken> >Have fun
<bear2229> bye scootachicken
<ScootaChicken> >at school
<xcanox> The only brony musician I've ever listened to is General Mumble.
<Dashie_Dashie> give or take the animations he does with all the exams, classes, and homework is pretty damn good.
<Phase4|NodeJS> later ScootaChicken
<ScootaChicken> what is this I don't even
<HeavyMetalDash> just do eet
<xcanox> rofl ScootaChicken
<Lasharus> Oh, he's GOOD Dashie_Dashie. I just don't find him funny. :P
<HeavyMetalDash> find a way
<Dashie_Dashie> He gets me to chuckle.
<Lasharus> That's why I said 'find him funny' :P
<Lasharus> It's not my style. No biggie.
<Jim> I like the references he tends to make
<HeavyMetalDash> omfg my inspiration came back!
<HeavyMetalDash> thank lambofGOD
<HeavyMetalDash> I gotta go
<Phase4|NodeJS> later HeavyMetalDash , be inspired
<HeavyMetalDash> bai everypony <3
<bear2229> bye heavymetaldash
<Jim> have fun HeavyMetalDash
<Dashie_Dashie> I find it funny that my xbox works better now then before it went all poo on me last night.
<Dashie_Dashie> I feel like such a nerd. :>
<Dashie_Dashie> 8 sleepless hours well spent if you ask me.
<Kammerjunk> But of course.
<Kammerjunk> I gave up on my XBox after my fifth RRoD.
<Dashie_Dashie> I've never had RRoD's just disc drive problems
<Dashie_Dashie> on both my xboxes
<bear2229> my xbox broke to :'(
<Wrek> 05if syndicate ends up origin only, i will steamroll EA HQ with BFG in hand, shoot and bumtaze my way to the director and throw him into the broodmothers womb.
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Kammerjunk> Bumtaze is best strategy.
<Phase4|NodeJS> inb4 its origin only and Wrek does badass rage
<Wrek> 05sure the game will probably suck
<Kammerjunk> It's a shame Origin is so terribly.
<Dashie_Dashie> Lol.
<Kammerjunk> terrible*
<Wrek> 05but atleast its syndicate "themed"
<Phase4|NodeJS> it is terribly
<Wrek> 05and thats enough for a nostalgia trip
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm waiting for RE6 :> and the RE for the 3DS
<Phase4> back to my normal nick, not doing alot of nodejs right now
<Wrek> 05the 6 in the logo looks like a giraffe getting a blowjob
<Simon2> EA is greedy
<Phase4> ^
<Simon2> plus the supports suck
<Dashie_Dashie> Plus their online servers blow ass too.
<Dashie_Dashie> BF3 anyone... owait.
<Simon2> always full?
<Wrek> 05but yeah i have started boycotting games are arent on par.
<Phase4> and this is all ignoring ea sports
<Dashie_Dashie> Their servers are down alot.
<xcanox> Hi Wrek.
<Wrek> 05so far ME3 and perhaps syndicate.
<Dashie_Dashie> oh haha, I just remembered that after I fixed my xbox, MLP was on the hub.
<Dashie_Dashie> the topping on the cake.
<Wrek> 05wow
<Wrek> 05i sure are on the negative side today
<Jim> Ponies
<xcanox> Wrek: I wish my grammar was as awesome as yours. :(
<Mortyirc> negativity brofhoof? /)
<Phase4> (\ brohoof stolen
<Mortyirc> well i guess thats negative too
<Mortyirc> :)
<Mortyirc> i mean
<Mortyirc> >: |
<xcanox> /( am i doin it rite?
<bear2229> nope
<Wrek> 05and great now xcanox is mocking me again. time to suicide.
<Dashie_Dashie> brb suicide.
<xcanox> Wrek: Are you gonna have yourself chopped up, put into a plastice bag, and thrown out of a car window? Cuz that's what I'm gonna do after I die! :D
*Jim stocks up on phoenix downs "oh boy"
*Phase4 hugs Wrek
<Dashie_Dashie> oh I just remembered, I can't suicide..
<Dashie_Dashie> spartacus is on tonight.
<Phase4> hugs make all things better
<bear2229> <3
<xcanox> Dashie_Dashie: Would your daddy be disappoint in you if you suicided?
<Dashie_Dashie> I'd just respawn.
<Mortyirc> Dashie_Dashie: y u suicide?
<Dashie_Dashie> ragequit.avi
<xcanox> Would your daddy be pride in you if you did a Sonic Rainboom?
<prince-dari> I drank 6 pints of milk today
<Mortyirc> my daddy would suicide if i mentioned a sonic rainboom
<Mortyirc> lol
<xcanox> The bones are strong in this one...
<Wrek> 05did you OD on calcium dari?
<prince-dari> XD
<Dashie_Dashie> prince-dari: I can't blame ya, milk is delicious.
<Kammerjunk> Milk is alright, I guess.
<prince-dari> Think it's 510% of the daily calcium
<ekips> heya all
<Dashie_Dashie> Cold milk > all.
<Kammerjunk> Milk is best used for tea.
<Jim> ohai ekips
<Kammerjunk> Heus, ekips.
<Jim> Cold milk is delicious alone
<Wrek> 05its ok dari, you'll jsut piss out the ammount the body doesnt absorb
<xcanox> Mortyirc: I can relate. I think it's a safe guess that unnatural items would come out of my parents' butts if they found out I'm a brony.
<Phase4> ohai prince-dari
<Kammerjunk> That's an interesting fact, Wrek.
<prince-dari> Ohai
<Simon2> hi prince-dari
<Phase4> i allways find it strange when someone i was awake to see go to sleep wakes up befor i go to sleep
<Phase4> timezones r confuse
<Mortyirc> Phase4 what the fuck did u just say
<xcanox> He said this:
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: That's because they realise that sleep is for the weak.
<xcanox> <Phase4> i allways find it strange when someone i was awake to see go to sleep wakes up befor i go to sleep
<xcanox> <Phase4> timezones r confuse
<Simon2> Phase4 timezone - 3 = Simon/Simon2 timezone
<xcanox> ^ that
<Kammerjunk> So they do it as little as possible.
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm still dissapoint that I haven't had a dream about hugging fluttershy yet.
<Dashie_Dashie> Y U NO WORK DREAMS?
<Phase4> ^
<Phase4> me too Dashie_Dashie
<xcanox> I never want to dream about ponies ever.
<Simon2> You can't control dreams
<xcanox> Because waking up would be too depressing.
<Kammerjunk> I^
<Mortyirc> same Dashie-Dashie
<Kammerjunk> Accidental I is accidental.
<Simon2> i = sqrt(-1)
<Wrek> 05lucid dreaming wants a word with you simon2
<Kammerjunk> Simon2: That too.
<Wrek> 05(yes its practicable)
<Phase4> dat imaginary ^
<Kammerjunk> But I didn't actually meen the square root of 1.
<prince-dari> No, 'i' is a letter.
<prince-dari> DO HO HO
<prince-dari> :P
<Kammerjunk> mean*
<Simon2> lol prince-dari
<Phase4> prince-dari: o u
<Mortyirc> O U
<diddutz> Simon2: e^i*Pi = -1 take that!
<Kammerjunk> I do dream about ponies.
<xcanox> I've never had a lucid dream. I came close once but I accidentally woke myself up. :(
<Kammerjunk> But I don't remember my dreams well enough.
<Simon2> I donno e & P ;A;
<Phase4> is it e^(i*Pi) or (e^i)*Pi
<Mortyirc> I usually wake up when i realize im dreaming
<Mortyirc> or go rape someone
<Wrek> 05my dreams are funnily enough in high FX HD
<Mortyirc> in the dream of course
<Simon2> the second one
<Kammerjunk> Mortyirc: wat
<Mortyirc> xD
<diddutz> Pahse4: e^(i*Pi) sry
<Kammerjunk> Dreams are best when you're sick.
<Simon2> I ain't old enough to understand much D:
<Phase4> wait
<Wrek> 05was protecting ponyville from giant wolves with samurai jacks sword. holy fuck the wolves were realistically bleeding and such
<xcanox> When I figured out I was dreaming, I jumped into the ocean and drowned in under five seconds. T_T
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: wat
<Simon2> Secondary 4 here, anyone?
<Phase4> diddutz and Simon2 just gave me different answers
<xcanox> wtf
<Mortyirc> wow Wrek thats fucking awesome
<Simon2> Phase4: wha?
<Mortyirc> give me your subconsious
<prince-dari> It's e^(i*pi) Phase4.
<Wrek> 05they even had organs
<Mortyirc> omg!
<xcanox> I killed my first lucid dream by having the lung capacity of a lego.
<Phase4> i'ma trust prince-dari, he has the banhammer so he must be right
<Kammerjunk> xcanox: I actually had a dream a bit like that. I was in the cloud-canyons with cloud-statues. Suddenly, a wild flood appears! Then an alligator was about to bite my leg.
<Kammerjunk> So I kicked it and woke up.
<null> Legos never drown. Your statement is invalid.
<Phase4> ohai null
<xcanox> Phase4: Wimp.
<null> Ohai
<xcanox> I challenge the banhammer!
<Dashie_Dashie> Oh fluttershy.. you're such a troll <3
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h2jbzoyNhk
<Mortyirc> I had a pony dream where i was a pony detective solving crimes in this big pony acaedemy posing as a student
<Mortyirc> rofl
<Wrek> 05the best part of that dream is that once the final wolf jumped me, we all walked the dinosaur
<xcanox> I fought the law and the law won.
<prince-dari> XD
<null> My brother has apparently become a hardcore torrenter so I can't even load the stream right now... sigh
<Dashie_Dashie> Wrek: O U
<Wrek> 05there is no stream
<null> Oh lol
<xcanox> lol null go into his room and sackpunch him until he stops downloading.
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: Only then will you realsie the truth.
<Phase4> xcanox: lol
<Kammerjunk> realise* goddammit
<Phase4> Dashie_Dashie: i love raritys face after fluttershy finishes
<Mortyirc> Dari, do u have the guts to try that again?
<null> Still, it makes me have terribly slow internet.
<Wrek> 05last zero punctuatiopn vid now
<Jim> There is no dinosaur.
<Dashie_Dashie> :3
<Wrek> 05goan do some chores
<Wrek> 05and if im bored
<prince-dari> Try what Mortyirc?
<Wrek> 05i'll stream whatever i will do
<Wrek> 05because its better than no stream at all amirite?
<Jim> Stream yourself doing chores
<Dashie_Dashie> I really hate when my dreams JUST getting good I hear a "TIME TO GET UP Trollface.jpg"
<xcanox> Wrek: Stream the first episode of Pokemon!
<Kammerjunk> Jim: That is a brilliant suggestion.
<Mortyirc> kicking xcanox. He says your a milk drinking swine!
<Mortyirc> inb4 im kicked xD
<xcanox> That's fantastic.
<Dashie_Dashie> inb4 I go to bed.
<Dashie_Dashie> owait.
<Dashie_Dashie> NIGHT.
<xcanox> inb4 another inb4
<prince-dari> It's weird when you wake up from a deram, and then fall asleep and resume the same dream.
<Jim> Good night Dashie_Dashie
<Kammerjunk> INB4 friday night.
<prince-dari> dream*
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: That's so trippy.
<xcanox> Don't you hate when you're having a good dream, and then your mom wakes you up?
<Dashie_Dashie> I should be on for BMN, not sure.
<Kammerjunk> I wouldn't know, really. I don't do drugs.
<Wrek> 05i do that all the time dari, though sometimes fails if i stayed awake for too long in between
<Simon2> in the dream, you don't think it's weird, but when you wake up, you do
<Kammerjunk> xcanox: Absolutely.
<Mortyirc> Prince-Dari: That only happens to me with nightmares and I hate it
<Mortyirc> The monster is like: Ohai Morty, remember me!? Kills
<Kammerjunk> I don't remember the last time I had a nightmare.
<Kammerjunk> Not even when I had the flu.
<Wrek> 05best part is when you are lyign there think ing a scenario, and as you drift asleep you dream what you were thinkign about
<Simon2> Did anyone had this experience where you continue your dream in real life for a short period?
<Mortyirc> Simon2: no
<Epona> I'm ready for the stream!
<Simon2> I hadonce
<Kammerjunk> Simon2: I think I know what you mean, ad yes.
<prince-dari> When you resume a dream after waking up, I still didn't remember that the dream was a dream though.
<Kammerjunk> and yes*
<Epona> prince-dari: Inception.
<Kammerjunk> I wasn't speaking Latin there. I just had a typo.
<prince-dari> Even though I knew it was a dream just a few minutes ago.
<prince-dari> It's weird.
<Mortyirc> that is weird
<Mortyirc> i can top that though
<Kammerjunk> I have never had a lucid dream.
<Kammerjunk> feelsbatman.png
<prince-dari> I don't remember any of my dreams any more Kammerjunk.
<prince-dari> :P
<Epona> Hey, have any of you, after watching a scary movie or something, felt like your dream was dark and heavy?
<Epona> It's not a nightmare, but just feels off?
<Kammerjunk> I remember mine very faintly for like, 10 minutes.
<Jim> I'm not sure that I've even had a dream, because I can only remember going to bed and then waking up
<prince-dari> The best dreams are the ones where it's something so mundane that when you wake up you genuinely think you've done what was in the dream
<Mortyirc> one time the last thing i saw in a dream was my babysitter, and when I woke up she was still in my vision. I could see my room, but she was floating there too. Then she faded away in blocks.
<prince-dari> >dream about brushing teeth
<prince-dari> >wake up
<prince-dari> >think already brushed teeth
<Epona> I like those dreams that don't make any sense after you wake up.
<Jim> Mortyirc: Ghosts!
<Kammerjunk> Epona: They're fun.
<Epona> Why is there no stream yet?!
<Wrek> 05worst dream this yeas so far: Im standing there at a sink, and im as thirsty as i have ever been, it was horrid. and i took out a glass and filled it. the water was perfect and ice cold. i drank adn drank and drank but the thrist never went away.
<Mortyirc> it was wicked weird. full on dream hallucination
<Wrek> 05so i keep drinking for a while
<Wrek> 05onyl to wake up and rushign to the ktichen for a glass of water
*Phase4 has never had a dream that made sense
<Wrek> 05cause i was still thristy when i woke up
<Jim> I've done that in real life, just drinking water, but still being thirsty, dunno why
<Mortyirc> Wrek I had that same dream, but always still needing to pee
<Phase4> honestly would not be able to explain my dreams, there conceptual things that dont fit in rational space
<Mortyirc> no it did not end with bed wetting
<Epona> Do you have any memories that don't make any sense, and you have no idea whether it was a dream or real life?
<Mikami> {08:00:25} <~Armageddon> nope Mikami
<Mikami> {08:01:12} <~Armageddon> so uh
<Mikami> {08:01:16} <~Armageddon> where do we come in?
<Mikami> you c- >'night
<Wrek> 05imagine someone crying in sinus curves.
<Mikami> god
<Mikami> dammit.
<Epona> Most likely, the memory is from your childhood.
<Jim> Sine curves are sad
<Phase4> my brain tends to dump stuff like that, if i had any i wouldnt remember now
<diddutz> Has anyone this weird one-second-Dreams where you dream you walk then trip and then wake up?
<Mortyirc> diddutz: yes i got hit with a snowball
<Phase4> i hate those diddutz
<prince-dari> I don't get why dreams have to be such trolls though.
<Phase4> and they allways happen in the middle of the night
<prince-dari> ALWAYS when something good is about to happen
<prince-dari> Wake up.
<Mortyirc> true
<Phase4> that has happened to me more than once
<Phase4> at least in the ones i can remember that had a rational end
<Epona> Well since there's no stream I'm going back to xcanox. D:
<xcanox> Pinged mahself. :3
<Mortyirc> lol i found that cute
<Phase4> i'ma go bet time now. gnight
<Phase4> bed
<Phase4> derp
<diddutz> sweet dreams Phase4 !
<Phase4> hopefully
<prince-dari> Cya Phase4

<xcanox> And that sexy nurse.

<Jim> The_4th_Wall: That drinking game is called "Alcohol poisoning"
<Yellowquiet> lol
<Yellowquiet> dat drink game
<The_4th_Wall> also known as suicide
*mario_pony is underage
<Dken2021> "Additionally, you must sing along with PINKIE PIE for the duration of the song or else finish your drink."
<Dken2021> but what if it's a new song?
*The_4th_Wall is a virgin

<The_4th_Wall> *ahead
<Inquisitor> "Whenever TWILIGHT SPARKLE uses her magic." alchaol poisoning before the second episode airs on the stream
<ekips> my stream senses are tickling
<bear2229> they are correct
<Simon2> alright... need to sleep early, I must attend tomorrow's movie night(morning)
<Inquisitor> what's dis?
<Simon2> goodnight guys
<Jim> good night Simon2

<Inquisitor> this rift?
<Yellowquiet> RIFT
<Dark_Horst> what's streaming?
<Jim> Dark_Horst: Rift
<Yellowquiet> no
<Dark_Horst> oh alright
<bear2229> rift
<Yellowquiet> is it rift
<Yellowquiet> ?
<Inquisitor> when my roomate was playing this it didn't look this good, @Wrek must have a good pc
<Jim> I think it is, he said he would be streaming it
<The_4th_Wall> Finish your drink whenever Princess Celestia speaks: A Bird in the Hoof or The Best Night Ever would kill someone
<bear2229> he said either rift or skyrim
<bear2229> and this is not skyrim
<Inquisitor> @Wrek... "EAT MAH BOOK!!!"
<Jim> I don't like the camera angle, but that I suppose is because we can't see the entire screen
<Dark_Horst> "read a motherfukcing book, scum"
<bear2229> i got to go be back in about an hour
<Jim> have fun bear2229
<mario_pony> you misspelled fucking Dark_Horst.
<Ingwaz|laptop> whats on stream atm? skyrim?
<Ingwaz|laptop> something?
<Ingwaz|laptop> dont recognize this game
<Dark_Horst> i'm sorry
<Jim> This is rift Ingwaz
<Inquisitor> it's rift
<Ingwaz|laptop> ahh, i see
<The_4th_Wall> Gonna play some Ace Combat
<Inquisitor> Mumorpugger
<Dark_Horst> so, what is it that makes rift good?
<The_4th_Wall> Anyone in here play Ace combat?
<Dark_Horst> is ther a pc version for ace combat?
<Inquisitor> all mumorpuggers - Right click, start kicking the enemy's shins, then they start kicking your shins, you keep kicking shins till one of you falls over
*mario_pony has never played anything besides a super mario game
<Inquisitor> never liked Mario
<The_4th_Wall> no, horst, there isnt
<mario_pony> how dare you.
<Dark_Horst> see, this is everything what's wrong with the gaming industry. console-exlusives
<Inquisitor> sorry, always been a Sega fan, always will be... since they don't make consoles anymore I buy nintendo, but on principle I don't buy Mario stuff
<Yellowquiet> "by the power of my math book !"
<The_4th_Wall> Ace Combat 6 was 360- exclusive, but the new Ace Combat Assault Horizon is for PS3 & 360
<Jim> Super Mario World was the theme of my childhood
<The_4th_Wall> Anyway, anyone play ace combat?
<mario_pony> i really liked super mario bros 3. that game ruled!
<Inquisitor> The_4th_Wall there's several games that didn't get ported to the ps3, that's the major in joke about ps3 not having any games
<Kammerjunk> Super Mario Bros. 3 was satanic.
<Kammerjunk> AVGN told me so.
<Kammerjunk> And then he fought his console with Nintendo accesories.
<Kammerjunk> accessories*
<Inquisitor> never really got into Ace Combat, to me a flight sim is best played on the pc
<Jim> suddenly, pixles
<Kammerjunk> A flight sim is best played with a joystick.
<Jim> ^
*The_4th_Wall started playing Borderlands instead
<Kammerjunk> I also play racing games with joysticks, but that's because I'm too lazy to go out and buy a wheel.
<Jim> I like borderlands
<Inquisitor> I liked the game similar to borderlands better... Dead Island
<mario_pony> yeah i saw that too Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Saw what? That I'm a lazy git?
<The_4th_Wall> Xbox 360, my gt is MetaMiek
<mario_pony> well i have to leve no bye everypony!
<Kammerjunk> See you.
<The_4th_Wall> Bai
<Inquisitor> Kammerjunk ya from Brittan?
<Kammerjunk> Not quite.
<Kammerjunk> Denmark.
<Inquisitor> ah, Kinda figured somewhere in europe
<Inquisitor> americans never use cool coloquials like "git" and "leg it" I wish we did
<The_4th_Wall> Just making runs on Crawmerax, if anyone wants to join me
<Kammerjunk> I like using those. I just do it on a whim, mostly.
<The_4th_Wall> send me a friend request, i'll add
<Jim> Do you have it on pc?
<Kammerjunk> We need more cross-platform games.
<Kammerjunk> VALVe did a good job with Portal 2.
<The_4th_Wall> 360
<Jim> awww
<Jim> I have borderlands both on pc and ps3
<Sammy> Hello
<Jim> but not 360
<Jim> Hi Sammy
<Sammy> What game is that?
<Jim> On the stream? Rift
<Kammerjunk> So I'm watching the first X-Men because I'm bored and the first 3 films are great.
<Jim> I know, they are, arent they :)
<Kammerjunk> And suddenly, I notice that Rogue's boyfriend looks scarily a lot like Robert Pattinson.
<Inquisitor> my 360 gamer tag is WoefulRequiem, though I don't have Gold so I wont be able to join most games :(
<Jim> The reason why I don't have the 360 is because of I don't use my consoles enough for the reoccuring costs for internet to be worth it
<PinkiePie101> *ahem*
<PinkiePie101> Gentlemen.
<Jim> ohai PinkiePie101
<PinkiePie101> Hello everypony
<bmacintosh> hello pinkie
<The_4th_Wall> I got that, woeful
<The_4th_Wall> Hi
<Inquisitor> I got a 360 spacifically for Warhammer 40k: Space Marine, and Silent Hill Downpour
<Jim> dat yay
<PinkiePie101> "The 4th Wall"
*The_4th_Wall is broken
<PinkiePie101> PINKIE PIE WILL BREAK YOU
<Kammerjunk> I still wish there was a mutant version of Martin Luther King, Jr.
<PinkiePie101> What game is this?
<Jim> That's rather spesific Kammerjunk, why?
<Inquisitor> Rift PinkiePie101
<PinkiePie101> Oh
<PinkiePie101> Holy shit a bear
<Kammerjunk> Jim: Because I'm watching X-Men.
<PinkiePie101> let fluttershy kick the bear's ass.
<Inquisitor> think I'mma play some Mass Effect 2... gotta beat it before 3 comes out
<Jim> have fun Inquisitor
<Inquisitor> thankie
<xcanox> Pinkie Pie is a maniac!
*Rainbowjack waves at everypony
<xcanox> Rainbowja- ?
<PinkiePie101> Hello Rainbowjack
<Kammerjunk> It is the opinion of the entire staff that Pinkie Pie is criminally insane-sane-sane-sane.
<Jim> ohai Rainbowjack
<PinkiePie101> Everypony...

<PinkiePie101> Hey Pegashy

<xcanox> We're aware.
<Pegashy> Couldn't resist
<Kammerjunk> A wild Wrek appears!
<Wrek> 05it may be borign to watch, but its better than no stream at all...
<PinkiePie101> I dunno why but I'm glad :D
<xcanox> Please don't spoil.
<PinkiePie101> I wont :3
<Kammerjunk> Pegashy: I pity you.
<Pegashy> ?
<PinkiePie101> Also someone made a youtube poop of it the day it came out :D
<Jim> dat shockwave crash
<Kammerjunk> I pity the fool who pre-watches episodes.
<Dken2021> for those who don't know, iTunes messed up the date it was supposed to come out, so people downloaded them and pu them up on youtube
<Pegashy> srry couldnt resist it :'(
<PinkiePie101> oh

<Inquisitor> ah it's the valentines episode this saturday... should be a good one
<PinkiePie101> I cant wait to see it streaming this saturday :3

<Wrek> 05seems like no one midns the stream, yay! normally there would be hate
<PinkiePie101> eeyup
<Kammerjunk> We don't celebrate Valentine's day in Denmark.
<Pegashy> Daaww
<PinkiePie101> It's friday for me
<Kammerjunk> Or, rather, not in my family.
<Kammerjunk> We do, however, celebrate birthdays tomorrow.
<Pegashy> I only got one card in my whole life :(
*PinkiePie101 gives Pegashy a valentines card
<PinkiePie101> nope.avi
<Kammerjunk> I've gotten none.
<DainbowRash> ^
<Jim> Well one is more than none
<Inquisitor> eh, I don't hate Mumorpuggers @Wrek, and I've never played Rift so I'm rather neutral although if it were Warhammer 40,000 Dark Millenium I'd shit a brick :P
<Kammerjunk> We don't celebrate Valentine's day in general, asides from a few coupl.es
<Kammerjunk> Flower stores love it, though.
<The_4th_Wall> I'm 22, and I've never kissed a girl
<Pegashy> I know this year I won't get one too :'(
<Dken2021> Valentines day is pretty much a small version of christmas, it got very comercialized and people expect nice gifts
<DainbowRash> I actually don't care.
<Rainbowjack> who is playing RIFT?
<PinkiePie101> The_4th_Wall: Same, but I'm 18 ._.
<Pegashy> But yeah I'm 11, but maybe cause I'm on high school I will get one xD
<Jim> Rainbowjack: Wrek is
<Jim> You're still young Pegashy, just wait.
<Kammerjunk> I'm 15, and I've kissed a person or two, but it's not something I care about greatly.
<DainbowRash> ^
<PinkiePie101> WATCH, AS THE GREAT AND POWERFUL PINKIE CHANGES HIS NAME!
<JappleAack> TADA!
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Dken2021> I kissed an ROTC girl once, but she asked me to, does that count?

<Jim> Are you a spyyy?
<derpy_pony> never seen rift before...is this one where you have to pay extra for decent equipment?
<Jiim> Yes, of course.
*Jim spy checks.
<derpy_pony> Valeo.
<TOY_PON32> HEY HEY HEY
<Mortyirc> apparently molestias is a word in spanish
<TOY_PON32> Holy fuck it is?
<Jim> And what does it mean?
<Mortyirc> idk
<Mortyirc> imma look it up
<Kammerjunk> Discomfort.
<Jim> To google translate!
<derpy_pony> copy and paste latin
<Kammerjunk> Molestias means discomfort.
<Jim> aha
<Mortyirc> LMFAO
<Mortyirc> it means problem
<Kammmerjunk> molestia = problem
<Kammmerjunk> so true
<Dken2021> would explain the root word
<Kammerjunk> He is Mi!
<derpy_pony> so it also means opportunity ^^
<DainbowRash> That suits it more.
<Kammerjunk> And I am Yu!
<Kammmerjunk> Yes, I am you
<DaiinbowRash> Ohai DainbowRash
<Mortyirc> Molestias, parasprites?
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: I don't copy-paste, so I can't do them fancy accents.
<Jim> Molestia = problem? Problem? = Troll, therefore Molestia=Trollestia
<derpy_pony> well, I do
<DainbowRash> Ohai.
<DaiinbowRash> I am you
<DaiinbowRash> and you are me
<Mortyirc> Jim that was best logic
<Kammerjunk> I can do the accents on my iPhone, but not on my computer.
<Jim> Spy around here!
<DaiinbowRash> WHERE?
<DainbowRash> Ok.
<derpy_pony> lots of running around in this game
<TOY_PON3> Well I gtg to school now so bye everypony
<Running_Around> Mhm.
<derpy_pony> where is the coke and the hookers?
<derpy_pony> or dragons and stuff
<Hooker> right here
<Jim> have fun TOY_PON3
<derpy_pony> oh...hai
<Hooker> okay guys I'm done being a spy
<Hooker> wait

<Hooker> I CAN'T CHANGE MY NAME BACK
<Hooker> FFFFFFUUUUCCCCKKK
<TOY_PON3> Will do
<Hooker> f5 time
<derpy_pony> once a hooker, always a hooker
<TOY_PON3> Indeed
<PinkiePie101> Nope.avi
<PinkiePie101> I was the spy all along.
<DainbowRash> I knew that.
<derpy_pony> the mutated fox looked at you funny
<Ponygirl82> so how come nothing is streaming in here right now. Just that videogame paused
<Jim> I thought it was a pony/fox
<funny> he did?
<Jim> O U
<Kammerjunk> fjaæ
<Rainbowjack> why is it so blocky sometimes?
<Kammerjunk> Whoops. Sorry.
<PinkiePie101> lol.
<Jim> Too much data for the stream to handle
<Kammerjunk> I accidentally my keyboard.
<Jim> therefore it goes blocky
<derpy_pony> tentacle spider
<Jim> in fight - proceed to mine
<Rainbowjack> does it cost money to stream?
<Kammerjunk> No, it's streamed from their own computers.
<Jim> Not sure, the adds should fix the cost
<derpy_pony> mips.tv is financed by ads
<PinkiePie101> ^
<Kammerjunk> Via sites like livesteam or mips.
<Suiseiseki> 03a
<derpy_pony> so feel guilty for having adblock installed
<Jim> derpy_pony: We all do it
<derpy_pony> It's unusuable with ads
<Jim> A dragon?
<PinkiePie101> eeyup
<derpy_pony> magic eruption
<PinkiePie101> magic *snort snort*
<derpy_pony> kill the dragon, save the world!
<PinkiePie101> NO
<PinkiePie101> SPIKE DO NOT WANT
<DainbowRash> That book beam so reminds me of Twilight.
<PinkiePie101> "Twilight"
<Jim> RIFT needs a pony mod, NOW!
<PinkiePie101> Sparkle.
<PinkiePie101> c:
<Kammerjunk> I can't see the word Twilight without thinking of Twilight Sparkle anymore.
<DainbowRash> Obviously Sparkle.
<derpy_pony> sparkly vampires
<PinkiePie101> Kammerjunk: Same here.
<Kammerjunk> To hay with the vampires, I have PONIES.
<Jim> I don't think about the vampires when I hear that word yet
<Jim> anymore*
<Jim> Be back shortly
<PinkiePie101> k, bai jim :3
<Ponygirl82> mines not streaming anything its just a paused image. I guess I should refresh?

<Link> hsdv

<PinkiePie101> *was thinking it kills you*
<PinkiePie101> FFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
*Rainbowjack jumps

<Kammerjunk> Laser shark? Not epic enough.
<PinkiePie101> YEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHH
<HoohCGI0223> can someone please help me
<HoohCGI0223> I forgot my password
<derpy_pony> a native tribal village
<Q> Your password to?
<Kammerjunk> It should be a guitarist on a dinosaur riding a shark with rockets and lasers.
<derpy_pony> kill them and steal all their gold
<DainbowRash> Laser shark? *thinks of Austin Powers movie*
<HoohCGI0223> for my bnc
<Rainbowjack> i feel like i am watching a ripoff from WOW
<Q> Try #znc
<Kammerjunk> When I hear Laser Shark, I think of Epicus Maximus.
<derpy_pony> yes, looks like just another clone
<HoohCGI0223> how do i join via mirc?
<Q> Ask there, someone's gonna look into it
<Q> ....
<Q> /join #znc
<PinkiePie101> When I hear Lazer Shark, I think of Lazer Shark.
<HoohCGI0223> or can I join from here too?
<Q> Yes, you can join from here.
<derpy_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pozlp_wnkRk
<DainbowRash> derpy_pony: Thanks :)
<PinkiePie101> lol.
<Kammerjunk> Also, Epicus Maximus had a nice callout to Tobuscus with the EPICOSITY title.
<Kammerjunk> I love it when I kill the chat.
<Kammerjunk> Chat is dead, long live the chat!
<PinkiePie101> XD
<PinkiePie101> brb*
<Jim> and I'm back
<DainbowRash> Lol.
<derpy_pony> there are just not enough people to comment everything
<Kammerjunk> Do it anyway!
<Jim> I might not be here for the first movie during BMN
<derpy_pony> it'S 10am or so on the east coast...and most of them went to bed only a few hours ago
<Jim> it's almost 5pm here
<Kammerjunk> I might not be here for the second film.
<PinkiePie101> back
<Kammerjunk> Because I really don't feel like being up all night.
<Jim> But, staying up all night is awesome
<Jim> I'll probably get home from a friend to 1 am, then I will be able to see both movies
<Ponygirl82> what game is this? It looks cool
<Jim> this is RIFT pony_4032
<Jim> oh my tab fail
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, but I have a party to ignore, a pony episode to watch, and a virtual wedding to attend.
<Ponygirl82> XD
<Jim> I mean Ponygirl82 of course
<Ponygirl82> lol
<PinkiePie101> LOl
<derpy_pony> on equestria radia is a show with live phone calls between 4am and 6am cet on sunday...the moderator is angry and slightly insane most of the time...and a fanatic rd fan...and people try to troll him...it's fun to listen to that
<derpy_pony> radio
<Jim> What's it called?
<derpy_pony> celestia radio...that was the nam,e of the station
<PinkiePie101> SAY WHA-

<PinkiePie101> Say what
<Ponygirl82> makes me wanna go play an mmorpg now
<derpy_pony> me too...but then I remember the mindless grind
<Jim> I hate that I get addicted to MMORPGs too quickly
<derpy_pony> and that I don't know anything about modern bots
<Jim> I don't have that problem anymore, because now I have a stronger drug: Ponies
<DainbowRash> That
<Sumica> 00,10lets see, early am, game I dont resonise, this must be Wrek.
<Jim> Oh hi Sumica
<Ponygirl82> eh I'm a very antisocial rper I just head off on my own and hack everything that moves to bits for XP and points, and ignore most requests to team up XD so really no point in playing those sort of games, might as well just play an FPS
<Kammerjunk> My ass has finally decided to eat my hand! IT HUNGERS FOR MORE!
<Ponygirl82> hey Sumica ^.^
<derpy_pony> kill it!
<Kammerjunk> I absolutely love RPing.
<derpy_pony> it looks evil
<derpy_pony> coward coward coward
<Ponygirl82> lol
<Kammerjunk> I spend hours on end to create a character.
<derpy_pony> now you will die
<Sumica> 00,10A wild mod has appeared *cue battle music*
<PinkiePie101> lI
<PinkiePie101> :O
<Ponygirl82> derpy you are very violent. I like it XD
<Jim> oh, wheres that from Kammerjunk, I know I have heard it before
<Kammerjunk> And that's not counting the backstory.
<PinkiePie101> Everypony
<Kammerjunk> Jim: Dr. Weird from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
<PinkiePie101> PO IS A BRONY! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fj4vDzgRLg
<PinkiePie101> :3
<Kammerjunk> But you might have seen the TF2 videos.
<derpy_pony> everything is better with lava
<Kammerjunk> Who's Po?
<Kammerjunk> Isn't that a Teletubbie?
<PinkiePie101> Kung-fu panda.
<Ponygirl82> oh well duh, Jack Black would be a brony, he has it written all over him
<derpy_pony> I am a pacifist, Ponygirl82
<Kammerjunk> Oh. Never watched it.
<PinkiePie101> He's like "I HAVE A POISON STRONGER THAN YOURS, AND THAT POISON IS CALLED FRIENDSHIP!"
<Ponygirl82> sure you are derpy ;)
<PinkiePie101> inb4 brony

<PinkiePie101> Also
<derpy_pony> seriously...on of the guys who bring a spider out into the garden carefully

<Starflash> Ohai everypony :3
<PinkiePie101> Hai Starflash
<derpy_pony> hi Starflash
<Sumica> 00,10Behold the Thermo......Stat!
<Jim> ohai Starflash
<Kammerjunk> Thermonuclear missile?
<Starflash> Soo how are you guys doin
<Kammerjunk> Tired.
<Kammerjunk> So tired.
<Starflash> Gonna sleep before BMN, Kammer?
<derpy_pony> wasting time in a pony chatroom
<Kammerjunk> Starflash: Heck no.
<Kammerjunk> Sleep is for the weak.
<derpy_pony> sounds like a good idea
<Jim> Time you enjoy wasting is not time wasted
<PinkiePie101> I'm bored. wat do
<Starflash> Sleep is for the weak, or the smart XD
<derpy_pony> enjoyment doesn't pay the bills
<Starflash> derpy_pony one does not just simply get a job
<derpy_pony> sleep is for the sleepy
<PinkiePie101> awake is for the awakey...?
<derpy_pony> having a job means humans around me all day long
<derpy_pony> naaaah
<PinkiePie101> because awakey sounds stupid
<Jim> Unless you work with animals
<derpy_pony> ok...animals are cool
<Jim> 'cause I'm pretty sure half of my co-workers are apes
<dashiee> you need a job in the zoo then :P
<PinkiePie101> :P
<Kammerjunk> Hey, Sub Zero's cool!
<derpy_pony> maybe the butchery would take me
<Kammerjunk> I'm wrong chatting like there's no tomorrow here.
<derpy_pony> my skills are useless in a zoo
<PinkiePie101> I love the new EQD banner :3
<Starflash> btws wuts this <_<
<PinkiePie101> RIFT.
<derpy_pony> rift
<derpy_pony> it's about clicking monsters to death
<PinkiePie101> ^
<Starflash> oh sure.
<Starflash> :')
<derpy_pony> stream failed
<PinkiePie101> DAT BUFFER
<Jim> well, he's killing crates now, not monsters
<Jim> Hmm, dat buffer
<derpy_pony> it's dead jim
<PinkiePie101> *2 hours later*
*Jim pokes the livestream
<PinkiePie101> still bufferin'.
<derpy_pony> ah
<PinkiePie101> nvm
<derpy_pony> now
<PinkiePie101> Right when jim poked it, it went back to normal o_O
<Jim> I iz wizard
<derpy_pony> magic
<PinkiePie101> JIM, YOU ARE AMAZING
<derpy_pony> jim shall be the new queen of bronystate
<PinkiePie101> or, the new princess >:3
<Jim> Fabulous darling
<PinkiePie101> Wait
<PinkiePie101> if his name is jim, why do you think he's a girl... o-e
<Jim> 'tis a joke PinkiePie101 ^^
<derpy_pony> pony society doesn't allow males in administrative positions
<Ponygirl82> Boys can't be princesses and queens too?
<PinkiePie101> oh ._.
<derpy_pony> so jim is princess now
<derpy_pony> just a formality
<Jim> Princess Jim is now canon
<PinkiePie101> no, he's a servant now >:3
<Kammerjunk> Equestria is so sexist against stallions.
<Ponygirl82> thats kinda sexist now I think of it.
<Ponygirl82> exactly Kammerjunk
<PinkiePie101> Meanwhile, in equestria...
<Ponygirl82> it's like Dark Elf society
<Ponygirl82> hmm....... Ponydrow
<PinkiePie101> WE'RE SEXIST AND WE KNOW IT
<Kammerjunk> I wouldn't know, I don't play the Elder Scrolls.
<PinkiePie101> *music*
<derpy_pony> haha
<Ponygirl82> mining love and happyness with their stallion slaves
<Kammerjunk> PinkiePie101: I see what you did there.
<PinkiePie101> :3
<Kammerjunk> You know what, I bet stallions don't have equal rights.
<Ponygirl82> but wait
<derpy_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTZE2M0XzU8
<derpy_pony> down with celestia!
<Ponygirl82> flaw in the whole Boys can't be royalty........
<Ponygirl82> What about Prince Blueblood?
<derpy_pony> he is a pawn
<derpy_pony> stupid like a brick
<Kammerjunk> He can't rule.
<Ponygirl82> he is a prawn
<Rain> prince blueblood is a Duke not a prince
<Jim> I saw a picture of a male baby Alicorn in some kind of magazine
<Rain> Lauren said so herself
<Ponygirl82> then shouldn't he be called 'Duke Blueblood'
<PinkiePie101> Or duke GREENblood >:3
<Kammerjunk> Rain: And Luna knows we'll take Faust's headcanon for fact.
<Kammerjunk> Like AJ's parents-
<Ponygirl82> Duke Bloodyannoying
<Rain> He is called Prince Blueblood because hasbro likes money and Duke wouldnt sell aswell
<PinkiePie101> OR RED BLOOD, OR BLUE BLOOD, OR YELLOW BLOOD
<PinkiePie101> OR-
<derpy_pony> he behaves like a turnip farmer, not like nobility
*PinkiePie101 explodes
<Kammerjunk> According to Faust's headcanon, AJ's parents are dead, Dave.
<derpy_pony> if he is the best male pony nobility has to offer...welll
<Ponygirl82> Aren't most RL royalty inbred anyway? Seems to me he portrays that perfect
<Ponygirl82> ly
<Rain> Well then, they are dead to me
<Jim> Alicorn prince: http://dash.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132872498044.jpg
<Kammerjunk> Rain: Exactly.
<Jim> Think it's from a french magazine
<PinkiePie101> Oh wow
<Kammerjunk> It is, Jim.
<derpy_pony> and there was this rumor...
<Kammerjunk> Surely, you can see the French.
<derpy_pony> but...no spoilers allowed here
<Rain> Blueblood is also not Celestia's brother. He is her cousin, 57 times removed
<Ponygirl82> Prince Blueblood is very much like a French person
<Kammerjunk> Quite.
<PinkiePie101> ima go to make videos and stuff.
<PinkiePie101> bai everypony
<Jim> bye PinkiePie101
<Rain> bye
<Globetrotter> Ayup everypony! It's half-term now!
<derpy_pony> hey
<derpy_pony> I remember you!
<Rain> ok then Globetrotter?
<Jim> hi Globetrotter
<Kammerjunk> Half-term what?
<Kammerjunk> Is it the Superbowl?
<Jim> Are you pregnant?
<Globetrotter> Holiday
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Globetrotter> A week long holiday
<Kammerjunk> I also had a week long holiday.
<Globetrotter> after half of a term of sixth form
<Kammerjunk> I call it school, though.
<derpy_pony> of course you will use the time wisely for your studies
<derpy_pony> like we all do
<Globetrotter> Yes
<Ponygirl82> of course
<Kammerjunk> Twilight would be upset if I didn't do my homework.
<Ponygirl82> ¬_¬
<Kammerjunk> I talk to her. She is the voice in my head.
<Globetrotter> I totally don't have like 5 skyrimnexus tabs open
<Kammerjunk> Well, one of them.
<Jim> finding any cool mods?
<Rain> Dear Princess Celestia, we totally dont use our time wisely.
<derpy_pony> I heard the creation kit has been published...anything cool already?
<Rain> PS: I didnt learn shit!
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: And I totally don't have 23 EQD tabs open.
<Ponygirl82> I think I must have derpy in my head then XD
<Kammerjunk> Luna darned fanfics taking all my time.
<Globetrotter> yes steam, I am totally 67 years old
<Dismo> 4 Hours untill the stream?!?!?!?
<Ponygirl82> hey don't you be damning Luna!
<Ponygirl82> 7 by the clock at the top
<derpy_pony> In my head I have modelling clay in all colors of the rainbow
<Dismo> I better go get some snacks soon.
<Globetrotter> almost 8
<Kammerjunk> Ponygirl82: I would never. I meant Luna darn it.
<Globetrotter> lol it's going to be too late for me I think
<Kammerjunk> And thus, Luna darned.
<DainbowRash> Lol
<Globetrotter> depends, though. Is it ponies in 7h 45m ?
<derpy_pony> it is airplane
<Jim> it's the movie
<Jim> !cd
<Tom> Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 0 days, 23 hours, 14 minutes, 56 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)
<Jim> under 24 hours until ponies :D
<Globetrotter> Thank you kindly Tom
<derpy_pony> ponies tomorrow...or...well...
<derpy_pony> tomorrow
<Ponygirl82> Very well then, continue with your darning. And be sure to darn ALL the socks, those ponies need them in this snow!
<WRITEity> still another 48 hours til we can talk about the new ep though.
<Kammerjunk> Tempus imperfectum, you know.
<Kammerjunk> It's magic.
<Globetrotter> Download ALL the mods!
<Rain> Dont do that Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> I'm sorry.
<Kammerjunk> Wait, do what?
<Globetrotter> What game is that I see on the stream?
<Rain> its hard enough already to keep myself from watching it
<Ponygirl82> darning
<Rain> please dont tempt me
<derpy_pony> I lost the fight, rain
<Kammerjunk> What did I do?
<Ponygirl82> darn = to mend holes in garments
<derpy_pony> in...like 0.7 seconds
<Ponygirl82> :P
<Kammerjunk> I just said "Tempus imperfectum" ._.
<DainbowRash> I watched it because I'll probably get lag spikes when 700 people get here.
<Rain> may have been unrelated to the 48 hours thing but
<Rain> [10:15] <Kammerjunk> It's magic.
<Jim> I am waiting until tomorrow before watching it
<Kammerjunk> Oh, no. Past tenses are magic.
<Rain> then I appologize ^_^
<Kammerjunk> My Latin Pony: Conjugations are Magic
<Rain> >_>?
<Kammerjunk> Yes.
<Rainbowjack> anyone going to the bronycon?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I wish.
<Globetrotter> Wait game is that]
<Jim> I wish I could
<Kammerjunk> I've said it before, and I'll say it again.
<Jim> That is RIFT Globetrotter
<Globetrotter> oooh.
<Kammerjunk> Anypony going to the BroNYCon in June, give Faust a BIG hug, will ya?
<Globetrotter> Is it a memorpugger?
<Rainbowjack> for me 2
<bear2229> hello everyone
<Jim> Globetrotter: Eeyup
<Kammerjunk> Salvê, bear2229.
<derpy_pony> hello bear
<Jim> hi bear2229
<Kammerjunk> Or should I say... HARRY?
<Rainbowjack> and anypony that is going to Bronycon I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO JELLLY
<Globetrotter> bronycons is in NY right?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, what I wouldn't give to actually meet Faust in person.
<Ponygirl82> I give up with this stream, I've refreshed who knows how many times and its still loading endlessly
<bear2229> yes
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: Hence the pun, BroNYCon.
<Rainbowjack> yes
<DainbowRash> I wish I lived in NY.
<Jim> I don't
<Globetrotter> yeah, I'm not getting from nottingham, england to NY, america anytime soon
<derpy_pony> you can fly to ny
<Jim> It seems like a way too huge city for my taste
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: I don't plan crossing the Atlantic either.
<Rainbowjack> cen you take me there derpy
<Rainbowjack> *can
<Ponygirl82> Fellow Brit! *Broohoofs Globetrotter* /)(\
<derpy_pony> probably not
<derpy_pony> sry
<Rainbowjack> lol
*Globetrotter brohoofs Ponygirl82
<Kammerjunk> Flying across the Atlantic is so bothersome, anyway. Almost as bad as jet-skiing or swimming across the Pacific Ocean.
<Globetrotter> Where you at Ponygirl82?
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, how did that end up on Google Maps?
<Rainbowjack> anypony here from Holland?
<Ponygirl82> Staffordshire ^.^
<bear2229> thesse people in the game must know alot about friendship
<Jim> Do ho ho, because friendship is magic
<derpy_pony> the british bronies should unite in a flash mob at some port and capture a ship...and then to america!
<Globetrotter> That's not that far from me Ponygirl82 . I'm in nottingham! Just a pop east of you.
<Rainbowjack> Fighting is magic is a cool game
<Kammerjunk> I wish friendship = magic^2.
<derpy_pony> this might work
<Jim> can't wait for fighting is magic
<Rainbowjack> Jim me 2
<Kammerjunk> I've never been a big fan of fighting games.
<Globetrotter> Depends on the game for me Kammerjunk
<Ponygirl82> I've never met any other British ponies where I live derpy, they are all a dour bunch who would rather dress like chavs and act like they are cool than love and tolerate because that is 'Gay' and thus intolerable ¬_¬
<Kammerjunk> I just end up mashing all the buttons, anyway.
<derpy_pony> did anyone try the mmorpg they presented at the last bronycon? I never hear anyone talking about it
<Jim> Will you make an exception with added ponies?
<Rainbowjack> No whats it called?
<Globetrotter> same over here Ponygirl82 But I managed to convert 3 of my friends!
<Kammerjunk> I've managed to accidentally convert some Russian guy I know over the Internet.
<Kammerjunk> I didn't even mean to.
<Jim> How did you manage that?
<derpy_pony> hm...join the chess club or anime club or something in the library...you will find them, Ponygirl82....in the places a chav never enters
<Ponygirl82> Yeh bloody British people need to get their tea thermos out of their bums and cheer up
<Kammerjunk> Quite.
<Globetrotter> The weather eh? So rainy and stuff. Depressing.
<Ponygirl82> Well its snowing up here Globetrotter
*Rain loves the rain
<Ponygirl82> cold enough to freeze your arse off
<Jim> Somehow it's raining here today, and I live in northern norway o_O
<Globetrotter> It's stopped snowing up here Ponygirl82
<bear2229> its perfectly sunny for me
<Globetrotter> Got a load of snow last weekend though
<Ponygirl82> hm must just be local then
<Jim> the roads are wicked slippery
<derpy_pony> it's getting dark here...sunset...the horizon is turning red
<Ponygirl82> my luck
<derpy_pony> where it shines through the clouds
<Globetrotter> lol snow is only good when you get proper snow
<Jim> the sun set aproxemately at 4 pm here
<WRITEity> ...WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW? http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz4qld9BEP1qezg8qo1_500.jpg
<Globetrotter> it's 430pm here Jim

<DainbowRash> I'm a zombie
<Turgle> Yeah, me too
<Deadgnr> What's up
<Ponygirl82> well I'm alright then, I have no brains for you guys to eat
<Kammerjunk|Who> You cannot brain today?
<Kammerjunk|Who> You have the dumbs.
<Ponygirl82> I cannot brain anyday
<Ponygirl82> i r baboon
<DainbowRash> I'm a vegetarian zombie.
<Ponygirl82> but plants don't have brains
<Dken2021> oh look, someone remembers a show I used to watcch
<Ponygirl82> I remember a lot of shows people used to watch
<Kammerjunk|Who> I don't.
<Kammerjunk|Who> If it's nostalgic to most people, chances are I didn't see it.
<Ponygirl82> bah young people
<Kammerjunk|Who> They were on TV.
<Kammerjunk|Who> I just didn't see them.
<Kammerjunk|Who> The only thing I've had to do with Pokémon was Pokémon: The First Movie back on VHS.
<Ponygirl82> bleh pokemon I never liked it much
<Kammerjunk|Who> I've never played Mario or Sonic.
<Turgle> me neither
<Frostfire> wut
<Dken2021> I have, does that make me a minority?
<DainbowRash> Not even teeny-tiny bit?
<Turgle> nope
<Frostfire> never played mario?
<Kammerjunk|Who> DainbowRash: Not in the slightest.
<Frostfire> i thought everyone's played that, but eh
<Turgle> oh wait
<Ponygirl82> I've played a little bit of Sonic and Knuckles which was okay but I always sucked at mario
<Turgle> i did play it one
<Turgle> once
<Kammerjunk|Who> The only thing I know about Zelda is what I saw in YouTube Poops.
<Dken2021> everyone's bound to have played mario in their time
<Dken2021> but whatevs
<Ponygirl82> oh ditto I've never played Zelda. I've played a ton of old games but none of the really well known ones
<Kammerjunk|Who> Dken2021: Not in any way, shape or form.
<Kammerjunk|Who> I have never held a Gameboy.
<Ponygirl82> you're like the AntiNostalgia Kammerjunk it's scary
<Dken2021> well at least you probably had a better childhood then others I suppose
<DainbowRash> I played 2 Zelda games. IMO better than Mario or Sonic
<Kammerjunk|Who> When I was a young boy, I read.
<Kammerjunk|Who> I read a lot.
<Frostfire> reading? whats that
<Ponygirl82> I read a lot too
<Kammerjunk|Who> I own a little over 700 books.
<Kammerjunk|Who> Somewhere in the attic.
<Frostfire> i jk i did read too, but probably not as much as others
<Dken2021> I use to have read books when I was little, then I had a gameboy
<DainbowRash> When it comes to reading, I'm pretty much like RD.
<Dken2021> but I still like to read from time to time
<Ponygirl82> most of childhood was spent playing original Doom though, like I said I like violent fps (well at the time it was violent. Nowadays your grandma could play it)
<DainbowRash> But if one story gets my attention, I can read it for hours.
<Kammerjunk|Who> DainbowRash: You like doing it, but you don't want anypony to know?
<DainbowRash> Kammerjunk|Who: Well, maybe except that part :D
<Ponygirl82> Aw I guess Rainbowjack left. Too bad
<Kammerjunk|Who> I like Rainbowjack. It's a good ship.
<Kammerjunk|Who> It's even second best ship to me.
<Ponygirl82> it is but I prefer PinkieDash
<Golakka> Im not too early am i?
<Kammerjunk|Who> Twixie takes first place to me.
<diddutz> too early for what?
<Kammerjunk|Who> Golakka: Just 4½ hours.
<Ponygirl82> for the stream yes Golakka
<alexxm> would borat be conserded an a or ab movie
<Ponygirl82> it says 6 hours and 36 minutes at the top
<Kammerjunk|Who> Oh, right.
<Golakka> Personally i think the Titanic is the best ship
<Kammerjunk|Who> I'm an idiot, sorry.
<DainbowRash> I'm not too fond of shipping.
<Kammerjunk|Who> The day doesn't end at 20:00.
<Ponygirl82> it's alright you can join me in my brainlessness
<Kammerjunk|Who> Silly me.
<Ponygirl82> no brain = safe from zombies
<Kammerjunk|Who> Golakka: I'm watching the Doctor on the Titanic now.
<Golakka> The christmas special from a few years bacl?
<Ponygirl82> oh that one, that was fun
<Kammerjunk|Who> Yup.
<Golakka> Really good episode if im honest
<Ponygirl82> David Tennant is my favourite doctor
<Golakka> ^
<Kammerjunk|Who> Tennant is sexiest Doctor.
<Ponygirl82> I don't think much of the new one at all
<Golakka> Im Scottish, so i have to agree, by law.
<Ponygirl82> lol
<Kammerjunk|Who> I'm with Dari on Matt Smith.
<diddutz> Someday we could watch Titanic II on movie night, if we add a C-Movie Section
<Ponygirl82> I'm 1/8th scottish does that count?
<Golakka> nah, Raise the titanic
<Kammerjunk|Who> I'm all Viking.
<alexxm> diddutz what movie would borat be
<Golakka> im 1/8th french :P
<Ponygirl82> Vikings are cool ^.^ I love their culture and mythology
<Kammerjunk|Who> alexxm: Out of any scale you throw at it.
<diddutz> idk never watched borat
<Golakka> Sascha Baren Cochen is banned from kazakstan "Upon pain of death"
<Kammerjunk|Who> If you use the entire alphabet, including æøå, it's worse.
<alexxm> ok
<Golakka> Why is battle pirates soo bloody addictive
<Dark_Horst> still?
<Kammerjunk|Who> Well, mIRC decided that I have an English keyboard layout, so I'm going to restart it.
<Turgle> nice
<Kammerjunk|Who> Information: You are all going to die.
<Ponygirl82> eh I'm bored again, I think I'll go draw something

<Saturn`> i think there's a network failure in the datacentre
<Saturn`> apparently, staff are working to fix the problem
<xcanox> Is there a stream going on?
<Saturn`> meanwhile, this means i don't have access to any of my coursework i'm working on
<Saturn`> time for the pub, methinks

*xcanox GTFOs
<Turgle> time for pub indeed
<Kammerjunk|Who> I'm hungry.
<Kammerjunk|Who> But I'm too lazy to go all the way downstairs and get some food.
<Saturn`> xcanox: there is, but i think it's gamestreaming
<Saturn`> Kammerjunk|Who: COME TO SCOTLAND AND EAT HAGGIS!
<Saturn`> you know it is the only way your heart will be free
<Kammerjunk|Who> You know, I've never had Haggis.
<Saturn`> and your hunger can be quenched
<Saturn`> it's actually damn tasty
<Kammerjunk|Who> I think I prefer some bread and a cup of Earl Gray.
<xcanox> Saturn`: oic
<Saturn`> earl grey + scones + jam
<Saturn`> + clotted cream
<Kammerjunk|Who> My mouth waters.

<xcanox> Kammerjunk: Orlly? Cuz I have you on record admitting that you don't know how to tie shoes.
<Kammerjunk> N- No you don't.

<Gumri> I realised something not long ago. Wrek sounds a lot like micthemicrophonezero.

<emangamer> I still have a house in orlando
<emangamer> but its being rented out
<Sumica> 00,10but then again I had friens that worked there so we went like every other day
<Gumri> I am trying to work out what we are talking about but it is proving hard
<ScootaChicken> Gumri: I'm not sure whether Wrek will consider that a compliment...
<emangamer> sumica, i know. i had a season pass so i went like twice a month
<Gumri> Not really a compliment or an insult, an ovservation.
<Rain> is Wrek using LS to stream or mips?
<xcanox> Kammerjunk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC7g3DawSgs
<Gumri> mips
<Sumica> 00,10wrek uses mips
<emangamer> but i must leave

<Sumica> 00,10have fun emangamer
<Kammerjunk> Oh, hey. Spongebob. Another show I never watched.
<Turgle> ^
<alexxm> hugs emangamer
<Gumri> mips is a pain because when you click it it sends you into the void of internet.
<Rain> so the stream is on black out atm right?
<Gumri> no there is a stream but not much on it.
*Rain is not sure if her school likes mips
<Rain> damn I wish he was using ls
<Rain> the campus likes LS
<xcanox> You know I couldn't believe my eyes, it felt so good inside, you said that you love me, oh yes you did, yes you did, yes you did.
<Gumri> I am just about to be brilliant!
<Gumri> I am going to ponify all of the holy grail!
<Midnight_Tempest> hai gaiz

<D1sc0rD> that is epic
<Rain> lol
<Midnight_Tempest> well... this is a slow day...
<MirrorImage> and the bridge of death went up yesterday i believe
<Kammerjunk> Gee, I wonder if I will get anything to eat tonight, or if I'll just stay up here because I'm a lazy git.
<xcanox> Kammerjunk: You gotta take a lace in each hand, you go over and under again. Make a loop-dee-loop and pull, and your shoes are lookin' cool.
<Rain> this campus hates mips so much that clicking on it doesnt even send me to another site
<Kammerjunk> ...Twelve. Twelve. Twelve. Twelve. Twelve.
<Gumri> :( there are no bronies on Xbox live atm
<xcanox> Gumri: Let's fix that problem.
<Kammerjunk> Apples. Oranges. Pears. Plums. Kumquats. Tangerines. Lemons. Limes. Avocado. Tomato. Banana. Papaya. Guava.
<Kammerjunk> Error. Error. Error. Fact not found.
<alexxm> heads up pony episodes down on youtube again

<Turgle> HD gifs
<Wrek> 05i return with garlic bread
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: You should have checked the "Show hidden files and folders" feature.
<Rain> General fact: Adolf Hitler's mother seriously considered having an abortion but was talked out of it by her doctor.
<Rain> and that is true ^
<Rain> also
<alexxm> how many pictures was it Gumri
<Rain> Wrek!!!!!!!!
<Dark_Horst> i wonder how the doctor felt in the war
<Rain> how have you been Wrek? ^_^

<alexxm> hey wrek
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi wrek

<Gumri> ohai Wrek
<Kammerjunk> We would probably not have this fandom.
<Turgle> lolwut
<alexxm> why
<Dark_Horst> no doubt about that, kammerjunk

<alexxm> lol
<Wrek> 05only works if you have it in one sentence cammer
<Rain> nope
<Rain> yep
<Radu> I don't know your voice silly
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, figures.
<Radu> You're reading this in my voice
<Radu> Ze classic one
<Kammerjunk> I kind of think -while- I type/speak, so I don't really plan ahead.
<Rain> Good news everyone! Not only did you this read in my voice, but you also this read wrong!
<Radu> mfw^
<Kammerjunk> I read what wrong?
<Radu> did you this read
<Kammerjunk> oh
<Rain> read it again
<Radu> this read
<Radu> mfw
<Rain> lol
<Kammerjunk> That was an experiment, IIRC.
*Midnight_Tempest walks around on the ceiling, like a baws
<Radu> Not sure if spider pig... or Poundcake
<Rain> or any peg that can fly
<DainbowRash> Anypony know the title of this tune?
*bear2229 just found out hearts and hooves day is already released
<Radu> I haven't seen a pegasus flying on the ceiling yet.
<Rain> you have seen RD flying upside down, no?
<Rain> Derpy too
<Wrek> 05DainbowRash, this is the whole 3 hours live concert of pink floyd
<Wrek> 05PULSE
<Radu> Doesn't mean she can walk on the ceiling
<Midnight_Tempest> best concert evah
<Radu> Everyflyingthing can fly upside down
<Kammerjunk> I fly upside down in WoW.
<Radu> Except planes.
<Kammerjunk> Luna bless consoles.
<Midnight_Tempest> planes can fly upside down... just not very well
<Mortyweb> http://poni.0au.de/story/10288/Fun-with-Slumber-Parties leave a comment, make my day
<Kammerjunk> Yay! More stories!
<Kammerjunk> BOOKS
<Radu> inb4someone says Molestia
<DainbowRash> Wrek: Thanks :)
<Kammerjunk> ...Sorry.
<Mortyweb> Radu, did you know molestias means problem in spanish?
<Radu> ...really?
<Radu> Me Gusta
<Mortyweb> yes really
<Kammerjunk> 'Molestias' translates to "discomfort".
<dashiee> i knew that earlier today
<Kammerjunk> So did I.
<Kammerjunk> But nopony will listen to me.
<Mortyweb> you know how when a pony video is taken down theres the red sad face that says "weve encountered a problem?"
<Mortyweb> when you switch to spanish it says hwjq kdk skq Molestias
<Radu> With dat :/ face
<dashiee> mortyweb : yes
<Mortyweb> well the first part is wrong
<Mortyweb> but it does say molestias
<Kammerjunk> Coincidentally, 'molestias' is also used by the "Lorem ipsum" thing.
<Rain> someone please take a screne cap of what Wrek is doing and link me so I can pretend that I am watching him draw
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<Radu> Have you ever dropped your cellphone into water?
<Kammerjunk> Actually, 'molestias' is in Spanish the plural of 'molestia', which means anything from problem to bother to annoyance to discomfort.
<Radu> mfw I dropped my phone into soup 2 months ago
<bear2229> coincidence i think not
<Kammerjunk> It derives from the Latin word of the same name.
<Scarre44> I think the name of this particular song is Shine On You Crazy Diamond.
<Kammerjunk> Id est, also molestia.
<otakon> hiya guys, what's up?
<otakon> Wrek drawing I see
<Kammerjunk> I think mIRC is using an English keyboard layout on me again.
<Radu> Ohai otakon
<Radu> £
<Kammerjunk> I'm just going to restart mIRC.
<Kammerjunk> Again.
<Midnight_Tempest> well... im gonna go, have some lunch... get some excercise and play some STO... laterz!
<Ponygirl82> and I'm back ^.^
<Kammerjunk> Testing, testing - æøåæøå
<Kammerjunk> tyay
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Welcome back Ponygirl82!
<Kammerjunk> yay*
<Ponygirl82> ty
<Radu> DAT SB
<Radu> Hi SuperBrony64
<Kammerjunk> So yeah.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02DAT RADU
<SuperBrony64> 10,02hai :3
<Wrek> 05hmm
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai Wrek :>
<Ponygirl82> drawing is fun, I can't do ponies though :C I suck at animals
<Kammerjunk> 'Molestia' has it's origins in the Latin word of the same name, meaning anything from trouble or annoyance to molestation or dislike.
<Altair> Hello everypony
<Radu> Hi Altair c:
<Rain> I cant see what you are drawing Wrek, but I am sure that it is Twi and I am sure that it is awesome
<Altair> Hi Radu
<bear2229> NO THE EVIL NAVIS
<Radu> Are you gonna finish the battle scene aswell, Wrek?
<Kammerjunk> So yes. Molestia actually means molestation. In Latin, the word for it is the same.
<Wrek> 05i have a shitload of work to finish
<Kammerjunk> Work is for the Wrek.
<Rain> so, how right was I when I said that guys?
<Kammerjunk> Radu: It's odd, really. In Latin, the word for molestation is the same as for annoyance and dislike.
<Kammerjunk> Rain:*
<Kammerjunk> Goddammittabkey
<Radu> Perhaps in the dictionary, molest has a reference to the Spanish word
<Kammerjunk> Which derives from the Latin word of the same name.
<ScootaChicken> ...I saw Altair.
<Altair> Hi ScootaChicken
*ScootaChicken glomps Altair
*Altair hugs ScootaChicken
<Rain> ok then Kammerjunk...? random much?
<Wrek> 05atleast pony isaac is turnign out alright

<Kammerjunk> Rain: Weren't you the one talking about it?
<Radu> Isaac, inb4 his twin brother Newton
<otakon> Wrek: this is a dead space crossover?
<Kammerjunk> I had to restart mIRC, so I can't see.
<Wrek> 05yes otty
<otakon> and hi Rain
<Genericblue> ok now nthis picture is badass
<otakon> Wrek: it's coming along nicely, your pony Isaac has improved greatly since last time
<bear2229> whats that arrow right next to issacs hoove
<Radu> Wait, look at the hooves.
<Radu> What's it saying there?
<Wrek> 05its a personal note
<Radu> Oh
<Wrek> 05says "fix it"
<Rain> Kammerjunk: I was the one talking about Wrek, drawing Twi and it being awesome. I cant see the stream but I am sure that is what he was doing
<Kammerjunk> Rain: Aha.
<Kammerjunk> It's all because of my silly tab key and my tendency to use it even for 4-letter names.
<Kammerjunk> Hay, I use the tab key when talking to Jim.
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Radu> Like mine C:
<Wrek> 05no one feels liek buying me heroes 6 on steam >.>

<Radu> Yup, nice concert right there
<unfoundbug> why do people always forget the "no spoilers" rule
<Kammerjunk> Say, Wrek, does this crazy piece of moon technology you call IRC have a system of limited banishment?
<Kammerjunk> unfoundbug: They don't read the rules.
<Ponygirl82> they wilfully forget it bug
<unfoundbug> oh god, 112 deviant art messages

<Radu> Is that Wembley Stadium?
<Ponygirl82> not my kinda music
<Midnight_Tempest> Pink Flyod, Pulse
<Ponygirl82> really?
<Kammerjunk> Roger Walters did a The Wall concert here in Denmark not long ago.
<Wrek> 05Pink floyd, PULSE at earls court 1994. the whole 3 hours of it
<Kammerjunk> Didn't go.
<Radu> mfw it looked like a stadium
<Ponygirl82> Damn nothing like their earlier stuff
<Inquisitor> eh, not a fan of pink floyd
<Kammerjunk> How is that even possible?
<Kammerjunk> Next I know, you'll be telling me you like Rebecca Black.
<Midnight_Tempest> damn... i cant stop crying... T_T
<Ponygirl82> I like Pink Floyd but eh, this song right now not my cup of tea
<Inquisitor> *shrug* not my cup o' tea
<Kammerjunk> Mmm... Tea...
*Kammerjunk drools.
<Ponygirl82> *offers MT some hotchocolate with marshmallows*
<Radu> Lol?! Same expression in 5 seconds
<Kammerjunk> No! I can't have tea now!

<Kammerjunk> And pizza is not right without cola.
<Kammerjunk> Radu: It's always tea time.
<Ponygirl82> pizza and tea go together awesomely Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Every wake moment is teatime.
<Inquisitor> and no way, I DO NOT like Rebecca Black, I forever curse the name of my friend that made me listen to that infernal song to ingratiate my brain cells to the knowledge of her existance... those are moments of time and cells I will NEVER get back
<Radu> It is? Well, if it's a stadium, I suppose it isn't a football stadium.
<Wrek> 05hey Kammerjunk, you live near helsingör?
<Kammerjunk> Inquisitor: So you forgot to get down on Friday?

<Radu> I wasn't pairing yooou, I was just mixing names
<Kammerjunk> I'm partial to prince-tennant.

*Kammerjunk raises his hoof.
<ScootaChicken> my dad got me into Classical music

<Wrek> 05and DIre straits ofc
<Kammerjunk> My dad basically rai-

<Ponygirl82> I did now Yellowquiet
<Radu> and mfw I can't close the kick note from SB
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I love Money for Nothing
<ScootaChicken> a friend of mine introduced me to Iron Maiden three years ago and I've been into old school rock/metal ever since
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the guitar riff is so godly
<SuperBrony64|NAP> 10,02You all can beat me with a hammer now for thinking Pink Floyd was the same as that girl singer named Pink
<ScootaChicken> Sultans Of Swing
<ScootaChicken> beastly song.
<Ponygirl82> nosey little wench likes sticking her face where it doesn't belong
<Kammerjunk> My dad couldn't accept that I did not like Pink Floyd or Queen or Ozzy Osbourne.
<ScootaChicken> Money for Nothing is great as well
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Another great song
<Yellowquiet> lol SB
<Kammerjunk> So I liked them.
<Wrek> 05my fav dire straits song ought to be telegraph road extended end solo version
*Amras0000 dislikes the video here.
<Midnight_Tempest> well... im gonna go get some excercise now... probably gonna listen to Pink Floyd while I do it too
*Kammerjunk throws a hammer at SuperBrony64|NAP.
*Amras0000 does not hear the audio
<Ponygirl82> ooh Dire Straits
<ScootaChicken> my favourite band is probably The Who mind you
<Yellowquiet> cya Midnight_Tempest
<Kammerjunk> Feel the Hammer of Justice!
<Sumica> 00,10good pick wrek
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Midnight_Tempest
<ScootaChicken> although that opinion tends to change every other day
<Wrek> 05yfw the lasers displllay the image of a moving cloud in them
<Turgle> saxy, you are so blinking today
<SuperBrony64|NAP> 10,02This song is making me feel emotions that I thought were locked away in my subconcious forever.
<ScootaChicken> aww bye Midnight_Tempest ^_^
*DainbowRash is amused with the lights
<Ponygirl82> Ha I like you guys you all have awesome taste in music
<Wrek> 05then try to focus on the lyrics SB
<Quill> this song is making me feel sleepy
<Kammerjunk> This song is making me hungry.
<Radu> I dunno why, but when I hear Kammerjunk's nick I think of hammers
<Kammerjunk> Or maybe that's the lack of food.
<SuperBrony64|NAP> 10,02Suddenly, buffer
<Hammerjunk> Yup.
<Midnight_Tempest> ill be back *you just read that as Arnold*
*Amras0000 turns up volume
<Hammerjunk> Radu: I can't imagine why.
<Radu> :O
<Ponygirl82> so sick of being the only rock fan in a town where everyone likes the crap masquerading as music that the wannabes on tv shows produce
*Amras0000 regrets turning off the mute
<Hammerjunk> Midnight_Tempest: I did, and I even read the last piece of text first.
<Wrek> 05Amras0000 is best troll
<Ponygirl82> how anyone can like that cacophony is beyond me
<Amras0000> I'm not trolling
<Amras0000> I hate this music
<Amras0000> quite literally
<Radu> Then don't complain, really.
<Wrek> 05which is why I will never respect you as a human being.
<Hammerjunk> Then mute and begone with you.
<Amras0000> :)
<Midnight_Tempest> stop complaining or leave
<Quill> xD
<Amras0000> fine
<Radu> We don't need to know you completely HATE this music, perhaps HATE is a strong word.
<Amras0000> I see
<Hammerjunk> You just really really really really really dislike it.
<Amras0000> I dislike the instrumentalisation
<DainbowRash> Dose lights :3
<Amras0000> I dislike the light effects
<Wrek> 05love and tolerate the guitarrs
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<ScootaChicken> David Gilmour <33333333
<Ponygirl82> I have it on mute I'm ashamed to say but in my defense I have a headache. I love Floyd and will listen to it later, but not in the mood right now. I am enjoying the pretty flashy visuals though XD
<Quill> let's not make a discussion of it. Not even a round of banter. let's keep it at a remark, and just move on with our lives, better people...
<Amras0000> I dislike the costumes
<Hammerjunk> Love the music. Be the music.
<Radu> For instance, I dislike Eminem.
<Mortyweb> im weak...i watched it
<Midnight_Tempest> we also dont need to know everything you dislike Amras0000
<Hammerjunk> Radu: Meh. His older works are alright at best. His newer, not so much.
*otakon holds the subject in fron of hime
<Amras0000> I'm a musician. I'm a percussionist. I really hate the percussion part in this piece
*otakon drops the subject and walks on
<otakon> c'mon
<otakon> just mute it if you don't like it
<Amras0000> I guess you have a point
<Midnight_Tempest> >_< ok... im out... love and tolerance levels reaching dangerous lows...
<ScootaGilmour> Imma do this now.
<Radu> Yeah, and what's your favourite genre? Rap? Hip Hop?
<Yellowquiet> Amras0000 you dislike it
<otakon> bye Midnight_Tempest see you later
<Quill> so yeah, what's this about the leak? What happened there?
<Wrek> 05you should have seen my dads face when I got him an 20GB SD card filled with PF, dire straits, queen and so on
<Ponygirl82> aw bye MT
<ScootaGilmour> bye Midnight_Tempest...
<Amras0000> Radu: mine?
<Radu> Yes
<Wrek> 05for the new car he bought
<Amras0000> 20th century art muic
<Hammerjunk> Amras0000: This is like that guy who kept telling me exactly how much he wanted to kill Trixie. I got the point at first, but dearly, my Frank, I don't damn a give.
<Amras0000> aka, classical
<Wrek> 05ever since then he's been cranking those speakers
<ScootaGilmour> Amras0000: we get it, you don't like Pink Floyd
<otakon> Quill: new ep was put on itunes early, Mic streamed it on his Livestream and it's up on YT now
<Amras0000> :)
<ScootaGilmour> if you dislike it, don't listen to it
<Sumica> 00,10did you bro hug wrek?
<ScootaGilmour> it's very simple
<otakon> ^^
*Ponygirl82 hopes she isn't in the doghouse for also having it muted because of having a headache
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nah, it's cool
<Amras0000> I really should agree
<ScootaGilmour> nope Ponygirl82
<Amras0000> It's just
<Quill> otakon: Well that was silly of him.
<Amras0000> that when I had PF muted
<Ponygirl82> I really do love Floyd <3
<Yellowquiet> ding
<Amras0000> I was accused of sinning
<Wrek> 05also *cough* Amras0000 is totally the 1%
<Amras0000> hence the discussion
<Radu> .1% *
<ScootaGilmour> Amras0000: people probably weren't being serious when you said that
<Inquisitor> here's a refreshing change, I said I didn't like it, I have it on mute, and I'm not discussing it...
<otakon> Quill: no it wasn't, he bought it fair and square and then streamed it. He got 2000 dollars in donations that night though to go to Bronycon
<Hammerjunk> I'm not quite sure you get the concept of a 'joke'.
<Wrek> 05Ponygirl82 its cool
<Hammerjunk> So hold on, I'll get it for you.
<otakon> okay, brb need to make my PIZZA
<Amras0000> I just like to take jokes literally, for fun
<Quill> yikes
<Yellowquiet> i love old music *.*
<ScootaGilmour> otakon, if we're suddenly talking about the micthemic drama, you and me are going to have a very long conversation...
<Ponygirl82> darn I want pizza T^T stupid paycheck not coming for another week. Stupid cupboard full of tinned crap :C
<Radu> So you're a troll
<ScootaGilmour> does anyone here like The Who?
<Radu> Who?
<Ponygirl82> I do!
<Rain> I do
<SuperBrony64|NAP> 10,02So yeah, this song needs to be one of my background themes everywhere I go.
<Hammerjunk> joke (noun): something not to be taken seriously : a trifling matter
<Rain> Im not a rabid fan
<ScootaGilmour> inb4 people who only know stuff of Who's Next
<Rain> but they are good
<Mortyweb> ohai SB64
<Amras0000> would anypone here be so kind as to PM me when the concert ends? Please?
<Hammerjunk> Sure.
<SuperBrony64|NAP> 10,02Ohai Mortyweb :3
<ScootaGilmour> sure Amras0000
<Amras0000> thanks
<Kammerjunk> If I remember it, that is.
<Radu> See you in 3 hours.

<Kammerjunk> I tend to forget stuff in 10 seconds flat.
<DainbowRash> I never really listened that much to PF. It sounds really good.
<SuperBrony64|NAP> 10,02I'm off to take my nap now after having this sound therapy O__O
<ScootaChicken> don't you dare SuperBrony64|NAP
<Ponygirl82> :C a fans a fan ScootaGilmour shouldn't scorn people just because they didn't have a proper rock upbringing and only just got to know most of the greats

<SuperBrony64|NAP> 10,02Pausing the stream right now should be considered a sin, but I need sleep before my class ;A;
<ScootaChicken> Ponygirl82: I'm not scorning anyone, I'm just saying that a lot of the people I know who like the Who only know stuff on Who's Next
<Radu> mfw ponified version of Pink Floyd
<Ponygirl82> can't you mute it and leave it running whilst you sleep?
<ScootaChicken> I don't really think its that much of a problem, just something I've noticed
<Wrek> 05posted that earlier radu
<SuperBrony64|NAP> 10,02The point is, pausing it in the middle of this song.
<Radu> Oh, really?

<ScootaChicken> Imma silly filly...
<Mateo> lol wth :/
<Mortyshotweb> lol Wrek don't play with my heart, if you don't write that I will
<Quill> that Tom, he sure does get around. A real highroller that one.
<Rain> or the plot of his fic if you will
<Radu> Then you haven't read MLD yet, George.
<ScootaChicken> I wrote a fanfiction of two ponies kissing each other
<Wrek> 05you are looking on the wrong places Georgelopez
<Kammerjunk> This sounds like Speak To Me.
<sampsoninc> why can't a fanfic be like a regular episode but better?
<Radu> Also, mfw my second name is also George
<Wrek> 05its breathe
<ScootaChicken> those two ponies were Gilda and Diamond Tiara
<Kammerjunk> Oh, yeah.
<ScootaChicken> yep.
<Kammerjunk> I just have Speak To Me/Breathe on my playlist
<ScootaChicken> Gilda is best pony.
<Baka-Neku> Rain: you here too love =O
<Radu> Gilda isn't a pony
<sampsoninc> those two ponies were mickey rooney and judy garland
<Kammerjunk> So I wouldn't know.
<Youngstrike> right...XD
<Radu> Tom is best pony
<Georgelopez> internet full of pony-fappers
<sampsoninc> rarity is best pony
<Baka-Neku> Young Tom is best pony
<Kammerjunk> ...Blueblood is best pony.
<Rain> I was here before I was there Baka-Neku
<alexxm> mick foley is best pony
<Mateo> wth did you drink last night?
<ScootaChicken> I wonder, are they going to be epic and play all of DSOTM now?
<Georgelopez> x D
<Wrek> 05as i said george, stay with us, forget the cloppers
<Mortyweb> http://poni.0au.de/story/9834/To-Catch-a-Predator%3A-Filly-Edition%21 Georgelopez
<Radu> Dem lights <3
<Mortyweb> thats not about ponies kissing
<Kammerjunk> Mortyweb: I read that one, it was fun.
<Mateo> Everyone of you desservers a kiss D :
<Turgle> Georgelopez: the internet is full of everything-fapper
*Wrek gives mateo a kiss
<Ponygirl82> I'm Twilight Sparkle according to that test XD
<Mortyweb> lol thnx kammerjunk
<Ouroboros> Hello.
<Georgelopez> kiss from a boy? lol no thanks
<sampsoninc> you mean flapper like the flapper women from the roaring 20s?
<Kammerjunk> Ponygirl82: Yeah, me too.
<Mateo> oh you homophobic e.e
<Kammerjunk> Which makes sense, she's my favourite pony.
<Georgelopez> hahaha dx
<Mortyweb> honestly, i wrote it to prove people like crap more than atcual good stories, but ive grown to love it too
<Wrek> 05Georgelopez, IM perfectly fine with homophobes, as logn as they are homophobes behind closed doors.
<Turgle> DING
<Kammerjunk> Followed by Trixie, but that's besides the point.
<sampsoninc> zuul
<Sumica> 00,10Reminds me of a bit from Cowboybebop now
<Radu> Wait, what's homophobia again?
<Georgelopez> im not homophobic, im just straight lol :/
<Rain> the fear of gay people
<Youngstrike> extreme closeupXD
<Radu> O
<Turgle> dahah
<Ponygirl82> ooh this is a bit psychadelic
<Mateo> then kiss me : /
<Turgle> love this one
<Radu> Heavy: KISS ME
<Kammerjunk> Radu: homophobia (noun): An extreme and irrational aversion to homosexuality and homosexual ponies.
<alexxm> am i high
<sampsoninc> weird, but it is artistic
<Georgelopez> straight = not gay = boy+girl
<Rain> normally it is a fear held by people that are uncomfortable with their sexuality
<Radu> Cheers Kammerjunk :D
<Mortyweb> its when you are like "hey fag! You like ponies? must be fag. pink shirt? must be fag. not a fag? must be fag. fag"
<Rain> and they may fear that a gay person can turn them gay
<Radu> Not a fag? Must be fag
<Kammerjunk> Mortyweb: You remind me of 4chan.
<ScootaChicken> homophobic people annoy me.
<Rain> or they are hardcore religious
<Radu> Seems legit
<Mateo> yea i know what straight means : /
<ScootaChicken> mostly because I have to deal with homophobes on a regular basis.
<Kammerjunk> Mortyweb: Were they have straightfags.
<Sundaysmile> the hell am I watching?
<Mortyweb> or they are already gay and they hate that they are gay so they hate on anything not masculine
<Georgelopez> pf.. whatever.. *kiss mateo^* e.e
<Turgle> dat bed
<Kammerjunk> Sundaysmile: Pink Floyd.
<Kammerjunk> Pulse.
<Kammerjunk> 1994.
<Sundaysmile> oooo
<alexxm> did the streamer get us high
<Mortyweb> um what just happened
<Mateo> puaj, get off u gay >: /
<Radu> Wait a second, is this a concert also streaming the music video?
<Radu> How badass!
<Wrek> 05you are watchign Pink floyd, PULSE: live at earls court 1994
<Georgelopez> hahaha x D
<Turgle> LOVE this video
<Ponygirl82> I admit with shame I have a bad habit of using the word 'gay' to mean 'lame' I really need to stop it. I am not homophobic and have many many gay and lesbian friends I view as equals but its a bad vocabulary thing
<Youngstrike> yea.....
<Radu> Tbh, I never swore IRL
<ScootaChicken> Wrek, are they going to play all of DSOTM?
<Mortyweb> ponygirl82: i hear ya. Its cultural brainwashing at its finest
<Turgle> well, i usually don't get offended if you use gay as lame
<Wrek> 05its all right Ponygirl82, no one here will take offence
<Wrek> 05Im sure
<Mateo> hm, actually, the word gay is better for insult than saying... idk "oh you straight dumbass" :/
<Georgelopez> lol
<Turgle> LOL
<Ponygirl82> its because my parents ARE homophobic and racist so I grew up with a lot of pisstaking about them and its kinda become ingrained. I'm trying to break the mould but its taking me a while
<Youngstrike> epic explotion!
<Radu> Because insulting the majority is like throwing yourself in a hellpit
<ScootaChicken> Ponygirl82: I do the same thing, and I'm bisexual so...
<Kammerjunk> Mateo: Which reminds me that people call me racist if I say "black man", but not if I say "white man".
<ScootaChicken> aww yeah, Time.
<Wrek> 05how to properly insult someone: insult their intelect in a way they themselves do not understand.
<alexxm> time
<Radu> xD
<Turgle> use sarcasm
<Turgle> ftw
<Kammerjunk> Use Latin.
<Mortyweb> mateo the problem is that gay is sometimes used to mean straight dumbass.
<Sundaysmile> or use insults from the 50's
<Mateo> hm yea right, todos ustedes son una manga de no saber español
<Ponygirl82> hm must turn sound on this UP it is pissing off my neighbour :D
<alexxm> my dad has the regaee version of this
<Georgelopez> jaj, yo te entiendo tontito
<Sundaysmile> goddamn chowderhead
<Georgelopez> lol
<ScootaChicken> Reggae version of Time
<ScootaChicken> I must have this.
<Mateo> damn, forgot you speak spanish e.e
<ScootaChicken> now.
<Kammerjunk> Insult someone's intelligence in Latin. Because you know what they say. Quidquid latine dictum sit, altum viditur.
<Ponygirl82> that dickhead knocks on the wall if I play any music at any volume at any time of the day
<Whiskra> I really wonder what's on the stream right now... so what is it?
<Ponygirl82> even if its like midday and really quiet
<Mortyweb> i have the dubpolka version of this in G major
<Ponygirl82> he's a total tool
<Kammerjunk> Oh yes, this song too.
<alexxm> yes it does actully exsit scootachicken
<Wrek> 05you are watchign Pink floyd, PULSE: live at earls court 1994
<Wrek> 05derp
<Ponygirl82> yet he blasts his Bob Marley at floor shaking volume
<Georgelopez> i am the only one who speaks spanish here :/? besides mateo
<Turgle> ding
<Shizuka> 13Kammerjunk: that which is said in latin appears profound
<Radu> Dat CTRL+V
<sampsoninc> to be honest, I actually like 90s CG better than some current cg because it wasn't trying to be all realistic
<Mateo> yeah....
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Exactly!
<ScootaChicken> alexxm: I need that in my life, right now.
<Ponygirl82> omg listen to him, throwing a tantrum now, screaming and hammering on things. Get a grip douchebag
<Mortyweb> George Lopez: Molestias
<alexxm> in fact my dad has the regaee version of the brick in the wall album i think
<Mortyweb> that is all
<sampsoninc> Did Pixar animate this?
<Mateo> If a ponny kisses an animal? is that zoofilic?
<Ponygirl82> I have to listen to ponystream with headphones because he throws a tantrum about that too
<Wrek> 05the lyrics are epic on this one
<sampsoninc> for 1994 this looks amazing
<Sundaysmile> techically it was trying to be realistic, it's just that people had lower standards back then
<Georgelopez> why the hell are you asking that?
<Kammerjunk> For example, if they call you something, tell them that "ne supra crepidam sutor iudicarat."
<Mortyweb> if a pony kisses a non pony its zoophilic
<alexxm> the alblum;
<Mateo> but they are animals anyways
<Wrek> 05told a douchebag at school he has an oedipus complex.
<Mortyweb> so are humans
<alexxm> the album's called dub side of the moon scootachicken
<Wrek> 05he replied with "thank you!"
<Mateo> maybe it will be furry
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: Lol.
<ScootaChicken> oh lawl Wrek
<otakon1> Wrek, kick otakon please
<Georgelopez> a human isnt an animal :/
<otakon1> I got dc'd
<Starflash> Hmm, Pity. can't sleep like this
<Georgelopez> its a human
<otakon> nvm
<otakon> I'm back
<Mortyweb> whats a human?
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: It's his own fault for responding like that, really.
<Wrek> 05there
<Mortyweb> and dont say a human -_-
<Mateo> hm actually, a human is a class of animal...
<Kammerjunk> He could've just studies more.
<Wrek> 05oops
<Kammerjunk> Lol, Wrek.

<Wrek> 05as far as I know the mareathon was goign to be streamed. but I wouldnt take my answer as final, bestw ould be to ask SUmica
<Mateo> what does the @ at the start of you nick means :/?
<Sundaysmile> it's christina agulera!

<unfoundbug> basically moderator
<Turgle> ^
<Sumica> 00,10It's in the newsletter wrek =p
*ScootaChicken noms kirzstryfe
<Radu> Amras, stop telling us you hate Pink Floyd, we got it, but stop bragging about it. I hate show off's.

<Wrek> 05w/e Sumica
<ScootaChicken> I can't wait for Us and Them
<ScootaChicken> shit's gonna be epic
<Radu> Wait, is this a YouTube video?!
<Wrek> 05if i remember shien on and us and them are soon

<Youngstrike> save your food!
<Radu> Icy.
*Turgle reads the newsletter. Again.
<Sundaysmile> doughnuts and candy floss at the ready
<ScootaChicken> Wrek, it sounds like they're performing Dark Side of the Moon in it's entirety atm
<nekohime1138> where is this newsletter?
<ScootaChicken> so if I'm right it'll be Money and the Us and Them after this?
<Radu> www.bronystate.net
<Wrek> 05maybe
<Wrek> 05im going of my memory rigth now
<alexxm> it should be emailed to you nekohime
<Wrek> 05too lazy to look it up
<Radu> *sniff* maybe
<PonyGirl_82> oh its fine, I forgot I put it on a timer so it turned off ages ago. Its just not cooked properly XD. Take 2 at making dinner
<Radu> Is this a Youtube video?
<Wrek> 05and tbo, its more exciting if its a suprise :D
<Wrek> 05i have the DVDs radu, do the math
<Radu> Hmm.
<Radu> Dat circle <3
<Wrek> 05MONEY
<Sundaysmile> CURRENCY
<PonyGirl_82> This is my FAVOURITE song <3<3<3
<Wrek> 05as performed by Pink FLoyd-
<PonyGirl_82> This should be Rarity's themetune XD j/k
<Sundaysmile> or Mayor Mare
<PonyGirl_82> lol yeh
<Radu> Rarity isn't rich.
<PonyGirl_82> she likes money though
<DainbowRash> I remember I heard that tune somewhere.
<Radu> Yes, but it's not canon
<Radu> ...yet
<Sundaysmile> technically Applejack likes it more
<kirzstryfe> 1,3haven't listened to this song in such a long time
<Radu> ^
<Radu> ^@Sundaysmile
<Wrek> 05rarity is a custom dressmaker, she makes more than any other of them
<PonyGirl_82> Applejack likes work whether or not it involves money
<Wrek> 05guaranteed
<PonyGirl_82> I'd love Rarity's job
<Radu> Only AJ and Rarity make money, and perhaps Pinkie from babysitting, but the other 3 don't.
<Wrek> 05also: epic sax guy
<Turgle> When I was a kid I used to watch this concert at least one time per week
<PonyGirl_82> I think Pinkie did it for free
<Turgle> and then I become a lighting guy
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Pinkie works at sugar cube corner
<Radu> Who knows, perhaps she gets paid a few cents per week
<PonyGirl_82> can you imagine if Derpy babysat the twins?
<Sundaysmile> would rather become a lightning guy
<Turgle> derpy +10
<Quill> Rainbow works on the weather team, doesn't she?
<Wrek> 05fluttershy may earn a buck from tendign peoples pets, probably vet student. twi is already a student. RBD works for the weather control
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Rainbow Dash is the weather pony for the town
<ScootaChicken> Money <3
<ScootaChicken> dis solo...
<PonyGirl_82> Twilight probably gets an allowance from Celestia
<ScootaChicken> David Gilmour is such a god
<Quill> actually, derpy would be good at babysitting twins, she could keep her eyes on both of them at once :P
<PonyGirl_82> she buys enough writing supplies to suggest she has money to spare
<Radu> So yeah, Twilight is the only pony not making money at all.
<Sundaysmile> Rainbow dash?
<Radu> Or, perhaps Celestia pays her for her friendship letters
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Twilight only gets her stipend if she covers all the plot points in her weekly letter
<Sundaysmile> well nevermind
<Wrek> 05she may also earn a buck from tending the city library
<WRITEity> Twilight has been mooching off welfare ever since she thought she contracted horn rot
<PonyGirl_82> Twilight = Student loan :P
<Sundaysmile> Twilight = moocher
<PonyGirl_82> lol even more fitting I got Twilight then :P
<Wrek> 05Sundaysmile you dont insult twilight with me around >:C
<Radu> Twi even loses money, as she has to take care of Spike too
<Sundaysmile> Wrek Twilight is my favourite pony
<kirzstryfe> 1,3baby dragon, tax credit
<unfoundbug> Pretty sure shell get loads off celestia
<WRITEity> Twi loses money because she checks out books to people without ever recording it.
<PonyGirl_82> oh yeh she probably makes Spike work to earn money for her
<Sundaysmile> and I'd find it funny of a alt arc where she's just a typical student
<Wrek> 05your faces when the goverment pays me to go to school
<Radu> Really.
<Wrek> 05true story
<Quill> same, Wrek ^^
<Radu> How much?
<unfoundbug> Go UK education system while its still running
<Wrek> 051050 a month in high school
<Radu> 1050 dollars?!
<Wrek> 05no, SEK
<unfoundbug> Jesus, thats a LOT
<Radu> Which means about...
<WRITEity> You know, once Twi gets her degree, she's gonna learn real fast that a liberal arts degree in Friendship means slim pickings when it comes to job prospects.
<Radu> 300 dollars?
<PonyGirl_82> eh I'm past school age or I'd get that too
<Sundaysmile> indeed
<Wrek> 05more or less yes
<Radu> Wow. 300 dollars per month. 10 dollars per day
<Radu> Not Bad.
<Wrek> 05as a collage it'd be more like 8000
<PonyGirl_82> currently on disability because I have severe depression and tried to kill myself so they said I'm not fit for work
<Radu> :O
<unfoundbug> WRITEity, very few degrees will mean anything in the current market
<WRITEity> depends on the degree.
<Sundaysmile> work related degrees do weigh more than a liberal arts degree though
<Wrek> 05PonyGirl_82 all i can say is hope life is treating you well atleast.
<unfoundbug> Masters in computer science, and still struggling finding even an interview
<Radu> Math Time! I'm so going to calculate the money you get during High School in Sweden
<PonyGirl_82> I'm getting better slowly Wrek. I haven't tried again in a while. Sometimes I still get real low but I'm managing
<unfoundbug> and we were supposed to be recession proof
<Midnight_Tempest> is back nowz
<Radu> Basically, 14400 dollars. Wowwwww maaan

<Radu> Uh, wow.

<Radu> Sweden's got a badass economy
<Radu> But from what?

<PonyGirl_82> Amras, do you have to antagonise, you're right you have a right to an opinion but you've voiced it now and continually rubbing it in people's faces is kinda rude. Why not just change the subject?
<Midnight_Tempest> it started snowing today for the first time in... a month i think

<Kammerjunk> BEN: "You know who isn't as good as Pink Floyd..." I stopped reading there.
<Radu> I think so
<Kammerjunk> Because the list is too long.

<Lucario> don't actually do it?
<NiGht[derp]> any pony remix sugestions?
<Bonbon4ever> All music is good except Justin Bieber.

<otakon> it's not bad, a LOT like TF2 actually
<PonyGirl_82> my Doom fics were about the multiplayer personas of this game as a team of space marines, but I admit as a girl I kinda wrote some girly shit about relationships, you know what young girls fanfics are like. It was like a Doom sitcom with monsters XD
<LunarKing> the stream is a bit behind
