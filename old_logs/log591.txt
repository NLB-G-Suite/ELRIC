<Shooeie> really?
<Discord> America is in debt 1 trillion dolars.

<ponyfromPR>
<otakon> they've been privatized
<RustyMeat> what kind of fucked contract is that
<Barbetos> Who the hell SIGNED that!?
<ArcherJoe11> Detroit is now Private Property.
<DocSane> Discord: Um, more like about $15 trillion
<Meanwhile> Barbetos: the mayor.

<VenHur96> Yo mad, brotah?
<derpy_pony> he ruined the city and dares to threaten the man who rescues the city?
<twilight_sprinkle> shiny walls
<Kandarihu> The makers of this movie are the usual Hollywood fans of big government, portraying a heavily privatized society as a crime-ridden dystopia.
<CK|Catnap> No, I take that back. He's like a slightly more competent Tracy Morgan.
<derpy_pony> black man is crazy
<Shooeie> Only 19 million?
<VenHur96> Shiny floor is shiny

<Darf14> That cop is a SPY!
<twilight_sprinkle> kid is mafia boss
<pony_9938> otakoni mean in real ime i cnow is a movie derp
<Kandarihu> Well, considering that OCP is a stereotypical major corporation, I wouldn't be surprised if they were behind Nuke, except that it's killing their own customers.
<Lawliman> The local bar used to have a pinball machine. I miss that damn thing.

<BronyInstrmntl|music> that reminds me, i have school work to do.....shit
<Midnight_Fyre> Truency is biggest priority for robocop
<ArcherJoe11> But OCP would profit from destabilizing Detroit. So they can justify their Delta City plan.
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: cause hes trying to avoid robocop im gussing?
<Shooeie> Shoot him
<Darf14> Buck the polic- *gets shot by Robocop*

<RustyMeat> so this great
<Kandarihu> From what I understand, the brain dies 3 seconds after the rest of the body, not 5 minutes. But taking that into account would've made this plot development impossible to write. Disbelief is suspended.

<CCCP> alexxm i know :P
<otakon> Distortion: it's control
<owloysius> get out the prosthesis?
<Spitfireisbestpony> :P
<Meanwhile> Distortion: Personal gain. And she's mentally unbalanced.
<StinkomanFan> Distortion because she's EVIL
<Darf14> Distortion: , because shes evil
<Underpony> I have a song stuck in my head and I'm trying to find out what it is but I can't remember any of the lyrics XD
<otakon> LEAVE IT
<Fou_Lou> Distortion: to crontrol him. Like the boy controls the girl with the drugs
<Vordox> ded
<DocSane> Truly, the dumbest scientist ever.
<Shooeie> Black guy so ded
<Meanwhile> Mayor you don't know anything.
<Barbetos> Now I want a cigar. Stupid movie!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder what happened to the cop they cut up way back.

<Sumica> 00,10they did the same thing they did to robocop Nittany_Discord
<Spitfireisbestpony> oh

<DocSane> Young Gordon Gecko, laides and gentlemen.
<owloysius> 37 million
<otakon> Spitfireisbestpony: we don't normally get requests here, it's whatever the streamers want to stream.
<Kandarihu> Control, control, control. The only decent human beings are the police, Robocop included.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They didn't show that IIRC.
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: I might skip that one. I don't know if I can stomach it
<otakon> Kandarihu: eeyup
<RustyMeat> lawl
<Distortion> just wants the 11 dollars
<otakon> oh shit
<Darf14> Thats a lot of monies
<otakon> WHY DOES HE NOT HAVE A BODY GUARD?

<Meanwhile> Mentlegen
<Distortion> This is real plastic!
<DocSane> That's like half a billion in gold
<CCCP> i would burn money if it was legal
<owloysius> now, kill robo cop
<otakon> CCCP: why?
<RaveBrony> Labels!
<Cypresswolf> Making a deal with Discord
<Meanwhile> You shut up. :I
<Shooeie> Now they ded
<otakon> Why do you have to label people?
<Squallken> here comes the robot
<Shooeie> Robocop 2
<StinkomanFan> Half a billion would let OCP make a portal to Equestria
<CCCP> otakon Cause Money is EVIL
<Cypresswolf> :) That wont end well
<Shooeie> Robocop 2.0
<otakon> CCCP: no, the single-minded pursuit of money is evil
<Barbetos> Optimus Primes.
<Barbetos> prime
<alexxm> everyone in that scene will die
<otakon> man, he's heavy
<DocSane> StinkomanFan: Knowing OCP, they'd stripmine it and enslave all the ponies.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But OCP would charge $1,000,000 per person per use.
<StinkomanFan> DocSane, true...
<Spitfireisbestpony> omg robocop 3.2
<Spitfireisbestpony> :|
<owloysius> i employ all your cousins

<otakon> okay
<Barbetos> The only good kid is a DEAD KID!
<RaveBrony> Cuz drugs!!
<otakon> to get drugs
<Spitfireisbestpony> :$
<ArcherJoe11> So the Psycho woman tries to control the drug addicted SUPER Robocop with Drugs, by WITHHOLDING them. She's not crazy, she makes Crazy!Twilight seem sane.
<owloysius> smart kid
<Spitfireisbestpony> :O
<DocSane> StinkomanFan: A world with precut precious gems just below the surface, and the only inhabitants are little horses. Fuck 'em!
<makoton> Dont do drugs, kids

<BronyInstrmntl|music> cleaned up detroit, by allowing drugs. a good job!
<makoton> Shit gets real now
*Midnight_Fyre thinks the kid has a point
<Distortion> Bad CGI
<Meanwhile> Whatever it is it's pissed.
<Thrackerzod> its yeh terminator
<Shooeie> Stop motion not cgi
<Meanwhile> And it's stop motion, not CGI
<CCCP> Distortion its not CGI
<twilight_sprinkle> well that was useful
<RaveBrony> Stop motion :$
<Midnight_Fyre> bad stop motion
<StinkomanFan> RUN RANDY JACKSON RUN!
<Kandarihu> The kid has no concept of business ethics. He certainly has no good role models, after all.
<CCCP> Its pretty good stop motion i think
<otakon> DocSane: honestly as long as it doesn't have long term detriments it wouldn't be that bad. No worse than liquor or cigarettes
<Darf14> CRUSH! KILL! DESTROY! SWAG!
<RaveBrony> pewpew
<XylemTube> for stop motion i find it rather Convincing
<otakon> CCCP: physical effects from the 80's are almost ALWAYS great
<RaveBrony> ded
<CCCP> otakon agreed!
<otakon> he's dead
<Meanwhile> Anything's better than CGI for realism.
<twilight_sprinkle> so many holes
<owloysius> Kandarihu: he's acting in the interest of his shareholders, and increasing profits.
<otakon> RUN FATMAN RUN!
<CCCP> Meanwhile YES!
<Meanwhile> Except maybe paper maché
<StinkomanFan> ROBOCRIMINAL
<CCCP> I AGREE
<Kandarihu> otakon, Liquor kills brain cells and tobacco coats the inside of lungs, though.
<Darf14> shoot first, ask questions later
<otakon> Kandarihu: yeah but if Nuke doesn't do that it's not nearly as bad
<ArcherJoe11> I remember the glorious Puppets from Starship Troopers.
<Lawliman> Weed > Liquer
<StinkomanFan> RUN FATTY RUN!
<Shooeie> ded

*Lawliman can't spell
<otakon> he didn't learn to take cover

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Uhh....
<Thrackerzod> Because its a legalised killer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can't follow it up.
<otakon> FIRST RULE OF TPS'S! TAKE COVER
<Midnight_Fyre> I never cared for stop motion, really. The only times I've seen it pulled off well is King Kong and some Harryhausen films (but only some of them)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Trying to make a Hammer Time joke.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Meanwhile: I'm pretty sure it honestly does
<CCCP> Meanwhile yes it does :3
<Darf14> wow, V2.0 is a jerk
<XylemTube> if this was Homefront, he wouldn't have gotten hit
<StinkomanFan> We need a Robocop fighting game
<Sumica> 00,10he's a mac
<otakon> Barbetos: Mecha Tank from FF6, although the actual mech was much more pedestrian looking
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: Try Robocop for NES :P a beat em up game
<otakon> He's nuclear powered
<Meanwhile> I like the nuclear symbol on it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tee Vee.

<Darf14> I cant let you do that Star Fox
<CCCP> XD
<StinkomanFan> otakon, it's close enough
<alexxm> its evil zordon
<Kandarihu> otakon, I never thought of it along those lines. Has Nuke ever really been established as a harmful substance? Or is it just a mental stimulant akin to some of the less harmful energy drinks?
<otakon> StinkomanFan: true
<RustyMeat> this is worse CGI then reboot
<CCCP> why do i think this is sooo funny?
<XylemTube> great!......ish

<owloysius> aaaagh
<Thrackerzod> ded
<Meanwhile> Cypresswolf: Now I am become Gigabyte, destroyer of systems.
<otakon> Kandarihu: from what we see, it's a mental stimulant. And the doctors said Kane's brain was clean. Apparently it has withdrawal symptoms and is highly addictive but besides that doesn't seem to do damage.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I loved how much 4th wall fucking there was
<RustyMeat> awwww yeah
*Vordox is looking away.
<CrimsonPhoenix> RustyMeat, are you saying Reboot had bad CGI?
<otakon> And then she was a robosexual
<JESmith71> This is why we relied on stop motion and other real effects back then since the CG sucked
<twilight_sprinkle> hawt

<Meanwhile> Robobuttfun.
<Kandarihu> Well, let's just say the commentary on here made it clear that people were soaking the stereotypes up like a sponge.
*CCCP huuggies Meanwhile
<Dark92Enigma> Rushed ending.....the humans were DUMBER than Robocop.........
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> :P
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Lol
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: S'called enjoying the movie.
<Dark92Enigma> Humans.....they don't think/10
<Dark92Enigma> lol
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> :D
<otakon> MaxTheBrony: with what? it looks like a slightly peeved Dash
<Meanwhile> Besides, did you see that robot punch?
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: as long as you know that are stereotypes.
<otakon> AND NOW FOR ATTACK OF THE CLONES
*otakon sighs
<CCCP> Meanwhile: no huggies? ;_;
<VenHur96> I like to give this movie a rating one step beyond/11
<Epicmetalbrony> @MAx I can see no ears, Also the eyes are too small for the classical MLP Fim style
<Meanwhile> CCCP: No.
*CCCP huggies otakon
<otakon> CCCP: Meanwhile does not hug, you should know this
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Robo Cooooooop
<CCCP> Meanwhile pwease! :(
<BronyInstrumental> i've still never seen star wars :)
<MaxTheBrony> Epicmetalbrony: Its the one hanging down
<MaxTheBrony> like sad ears
<otakon> suddenly chanting Robocop
<CCCP> otakon: i know :3
<Meanwhile> If I do hug, it's like Spyke from the X-men movie.
<Kandarihu> Fou_Lou, in the '60s and '70s, asians were consistantly treated as villains. If we were to watch a movie like that, and start talking about how all asians are evil schemers, it would be no less of a disgusting experience.
<Tovler> I missed a Kandarihu hissy fit. Oh well.
<Kandarihu> What? I thought he took me off ignore.
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu is basically chat's /that guy/
<CCCP> I love you!
<Epicmetalbrony> Good night everypony, gotta draw some ponies before its getting too early in the morning
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: Idunno. I really think I might skip Clones. The last movie was bad in a fun way. Attack of the clones is just . . . bad. 2.5 hours of boring annoyances, by far the worst thing to come out of the Star Wars franchise. I don't know if I can take it
<CCCP> I love you yes its true!

<Sabershy> Fluttershy!
<somepony_else> i don't really like the german voices
<Kandarihu> But on at least two occasions, I changed my nick while he's around. As far as I'm concerned, that's a ban evasion.
<otakon> oh look, THE SPEECH OF LUNA'S PEOPLE!
<Darf14> I hope he plays the worst voice overs
<Shooeie> Again no Latin?
<otakon> Shooeie: we JUST heard Latin
<Ryunosuke> that lip sync
<twilight_sprinkle> Shooeie: there were several latin songs
<Meanwhile> otakon: Nein, ich sprechen kleine Deutsch und sound totally happy about it.

<Midnight_Fyre> Kencolt: Pretty much, although technically both are spoken in Spain. One was considered more "elite" in the time of the conquistadors though, which is why the one carried over to the Americas was not the one spoken by the majority of Spanish
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> O___O

<Sumica> 00,10I was streaming, now Shizuka is
<Lunar_Brony> k thx
<cachi01> even freaking impossible difficulty is easy
<Meanwhile> Not exactly aware of legal jargon, what's the specification of a class action?
<BronyInstrumental> i would normally go to sleep now, because it's dumb not to but Sumica's streaming so i stay up until my eyes bleed. literally that happened once, it was 4AM
<CCCP> Lunar_Brony: Hai!

<Dark92Enigma> cachi01 Si pero me entere que Maggie Vera, la voz de Fluttershy canto esa cancion de ese episodio de cuando todas las 6 ponies obtienen sus Cutie Marks.....
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> :P Derp.
<Cypresswolf> There should be Derpy, there should be
<twilight_sprinkle> BronyInstrumental: did it hurt?
<BronyInstrumental> CCCP: i've been here the whole time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Valve is adding forced arbitration?!
<Midnight_Fyre> Attack of the Clones is by far the worst Star Wars film ever. I've tried to erase it from my mind and watching it again would be counterproductive to that end
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: sip en la bronymexicon
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 exactly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh fuck.
<BronyInstrumental> twilight_sprinkle: no more than staying up till 4AM would
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord nope as far as i could read
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not totally

<twilight_sprinkle> BronyInstrumental: i stay up until 4-5 am all the time :P
<cachi01> THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<Cypresswolf> Since we're on intermission - Has anyone heard of The Holder Series?
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile many people file the same claim under the same case
<Lunar_Brony> NOT THE BEES!
<Meanwhile> And here's Nittany to complain about the state of the...the...um...what's the word for like, group of things that are all similar and function the same kind of way in primal state?
<cachi01> THEY ARE IN MY EYEEEEEES
<BronyInstrumental> CCCP: no of course you can! Hi! :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> instead of everyone doing separedtly
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> OW THE STINGSSSS
<CCCP> :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Meanwhile: When a company adds a No Class Action rule, it means that you can't bring them to court under a Class Action Lawsuit unless they break a law.
<twilight_sprinkle> two BEEEEEEEEEEEEES or not two BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<JESmith71> I've been staying up real late for now, but that will end soon when school resumes

<Lunar_Brony> np
<Cypresswolf> a collection of 538 short stories decribing how to attain 538 items of demonic origin - quite a good read - moreso than the SCP descriptions
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: you quiero nuevos episodios para el siguiente mes o si no VOY A IR A MATAR A LOS MALDITOS DE DISCOVERY KIDS1
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My mind is blown.
<Meanwhile> Reading that sentence makes my brain hurt.
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 Y U RAGE?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> outlined a new required process whereby we agree to use arbitration or small claims court to resolve the dispute. In the arbitration process, Valve will reimburse your costs of the arbitration for claims under a certain amount.
<Lunar_Brony> In not-english?
<Meanwhile> I'll ask my sister, she knows law.
<cachi01> Lunar_Brony: LATIN DISCOVERY KIDS
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey at least even if you sue them they will pay you back the cost
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But they can choose the court, and pay that court to give whatever verdict they want.
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 oh\
<Dovah> ok so Ima tryin to buy minecraft (again) but the damn thing wont talk a credit card and why I try to use paypal its in friggen euros (im in us) can someone solve my delema?

<Quick_Thinker> school returns on the 14th for me time to show off the pony sawg i got over summer vaction :D
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: We've got to finish that Synapse game at some point.
<cachi01> ponyfromPR: NO
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> :O
<Shizuka> 13Dovah: Paypal automatically converts
*Lunar_Brony is a nerd
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01 empezando por: el especial de los sabados por la mañana (esos en que tu eliges el programa y ellos transmiten por dos horas) Sacaron a MLP FIM de la lista, mas no del canal (MAS LES VALE) yo tambien espero para el proximo mes
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reimbursement by Valve is provided regardless of the arbitrator’s decision <<
<ponyfromPR> ok :(
<VenHur96> Seriously, that guy should of been Doug Walker.
<otakon> KEEP IT ENGLISH PLEASE!
<otakon> or take it to PM
<Dark92Enigma> NO NOSTALGIA CRITIC?
<Lunar_Brony> otakon what about Engrish?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And statistics have shown that arbitration decisions go in favor of the company.
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, sounds like some sort of grimoire.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think by 90%.
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: no engrish
<Lunar_Brony> :O
<somepony_else> shoo be doo
*Tovler contemplates not eating pizza anymore forever.
<ponyfromPR> uh oh
<Ryunosuke> Shoo be doo
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> lolwut?
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> :D
<Dovah> Shizuka: so do I "link new debit or credit card" or "add money from your bank account"?
<Lunar_Brony> Tovler how could you even think that?
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: lo cambiaron de hora. envez the transmitirlo a las 10:00 como todos los dias lo transmiten a las 2:30
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not many people sue valve anyway ._.
<Ryunosuke> Shardz0fH3ll4386, wait till the end of Sumica's streams :)
<owloysius> what are we waiting for?
<Lunar_Brony> owloysius stuff
<Shizuka> 13Dovah: back when i bought i just entered the card directly
<Ryunosuke> owloysius, sea ponies :)
<Sumica> 00,10but Shizuka is streaming now Ryunosuke
<Midnight_Fyre> owloysius: Attack of the Clones
<Cypresswolf> Kandarihu: yep, interestingly, I found a youtube channel with several creepy pasta stories :) listened to them for hours last night
<Shizuka> 13it adds something like 1% for a conversion fee
<Shizuka> 13but it's all automatic
<Ryunosuke> :(
<Dark92Enigma> otakon Ok, bro relax........is it wrong that everypony from EVERYWHERE come here?
<cachi01> Cypresswolf: mrcreepypasta?
<Kandarihu> You know what? My privilege to be here is now in serious jeopardy. Until I can get this straightened out, I don't think I should be chatting here normally. I'm in a LOT of hot water here.
<Ryunosuke> well
<Dovah> Shizuka: whenever i enter the card the damn thing doesnt work
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: no but dammit textwalls in spanish are kind of aggravating
<Lunar_Brony> Kandarihu what did you do?
<Ryunosuke> I meant the frown in the fact that there probbably wont be sea ponies, not the fact that Shizuka is streaming :)
*Nittany_Discord 11,01sighs
<Lunar_Brony> sorry, I'm curious
<otakon> Dovah: did you work the shaft?
<Cypresswolf> Kandarihu: CreepyMcPasta
<Kandarihu> Harassing someone who has me on ignore.
<Midnight_Fyre> Kandarihu: How so?
<Lunar_Brony> Kandarihu :O
<Dovah> otakon: ..................................................
<otakon> Kandarihu: well just apologize and stop harassing
<cachi01> Dovah: this is what i did. i bought a gift code from mercado libre (mexican ebay) you should buy a gift code from ebay
<Ryunosuke> where was Luna when we found Gondor? :p
<Kandarihu> I changed my nick after I THOUGHT he took me off ignore.
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01 PM me bro/ mandame una PM, hermano hispano/latinoamericano
<ponyfromPR> Dovah: FUS RO DAH
<Kandarihu> otakon, this is WAY beyond apology.
<CCCP> :'(
<Darf14> no Derpy muffin is not a instrument...... Cupcakes is not a instrument either
<Cypresswolf> Kandarihu: Mr. Widemouth is a good one
<CCCP> poor dery
<Dark92Enigma> Los rabanos no son un instrumento tampoco
<CCCP> derpy*
<Lunar_Brony> Yes Derpy, muffin IS an instrument! STFU Squidward!
<Barbetos> Okay. I am ready for Star Wars Episode 2.
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Tbh, all I've ever heard you say is that you'll be in trouble. As opposed to actually saying anything...well, troubling.
<Barbetos> LETS DO THIS http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww303/DementedDSL/2012-07-31_20-22-41_884.jpg
<otakon> Kandarihu: dude how so? what did you do?
<Kandarihu> Apologizing for this simply means I want to get away with it.
<Ryunosuke> that buffer
<Dark92Enigma> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN
<ponyfromPR> i thought this was english only, idc if they speak spanish i understand but yah know....
*Meanwhile pats Nittany_Discord.

<BronyInstrumental> pass* dammit!
<CCCP> Chat needs moar trolls
<Kandarihu> Sure I would like to be able to convince him to take me off ignore. But changing my nick to something random that I know he doesn't have ignored and just chatting is way WAY out of line.
<Meanwhile> Np.
<Darf14> of course, Gondor was on the mood
<Darf14> *moon*
<CCCP> mood?

<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Shardz0fH3ll4386> Lol
<Ryunosuke> ALL THE BUFFERS
<Kandarihu> It's going to get even more complicated once Nittany_Discord gets his computer put together and starts streaming Steam games again.
<CCCP> i hear troubles on the way...
<Kandarihu> Midnight_Fyre, no excuse. No excuse at all.
<Meanwhile> Genuine shoutout or not though?

<Meanwhile> Exactly, still cool though.
<BronyInstrumental> CCCP: idk it's a referrance to something :D!
<makoton> We must construct additional pylons
<CCCP> BronyInstrumental oh lol
<Kandarihu> If it's more fun to refute my claims of innocence, or it makes people feel more free to find whatever excuse they can to hate on me, it would be "oppresive" for me to plead my innocence.
<RustyMeat> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: if anything, they might need other jedis more, so might as well send a padawan to protect her and hes a friend of hers

<otakon> Fou_Lou: they were sabers made of light...goddammit I hate these movies now. 1, 2, 3 shit on the lore of the original trilogy

<Meanwhile> Ryunosuke: Not with that attitude.
<RosePetal> Kamino, the planet that always rains.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: and they have *thousands* of planets
<SirGanjalf> I've got a LEGO minimodel of that ship
<Darf14> water! water everywhere!
<Ryunosuke> Its a storm planet, I need to make some Coolant!
<cachi01> i thought the lightsabers light came from a weird stone or mineral
<Shizuka> 13oh look, the planet where god had fun with the stretch tool in spore creature creator
<StinkomanFan> In the Lego Star Wars game we just skipped all that boring plot and moved onto this
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: would love it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: eeyup, lots to keep track of
<SirGanjalf> it's pretty cool
<cachi01> crystal*

<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And they all need a pair of Jedi at the same time?
<RosePetal> And now for our forecast- Rain and tons more of rain.
<Quick_Thinker> hm my favorie planet in hte universe is the one with the zombies
<Darf14> Jedi, welcome to Water World
<StinkomanFan> WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Shizuka> 13rain rain?
<Meanwhile> The Prime Minister of Kamino.
<Fou_Lou> otakon: actually its some kind of hot plasma if im right. and you can cotrol their output.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Also it's only a few hundred.
<Discord> HAS ANYONE EVER PLAYED STAR WARS REPUBLIC COMMANDO? THE BEST STAR WARS GAME EVER?!?!!?
<Quick_Thinker> yep
<cachi01> welcome to Zora planet
<Tovler> We could be watching Water World instead of this.
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka oh, now i get it
<SirGanjalf> Why the long neck?
<Ryunosuke> Rain is best weather
<cratorkid> i like these aliens
<Dark92Enigma> Oh, i forgot to mention that in the last movie (the I) They re-named the lightsabers as ''light swords''...............................HELLO??????????????????????????????
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: well seeing how theyre entire planets, yeah, at least a pair would be nice. and iirc,theyre thousands
<RosePetal> They is aliens.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Significantly less in the time period this exists in.
<Quick_Thinker> repbulic commando is not better then KOTOR thoough
<Fou_Lou> otakon: and whats so wrong of having some training sabers for the younglings at the academy
<Lunar_Brony> Tovler we should. You know why? . . . STUFF!!
<Shizuka> 13see... now we're getting something resembling a plot.... 40 minutes into the movie..
<RosePetal> It's a hotel.
<otakon> brb
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: No, it's only a few hundred.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: how can there be significantly less planets
<SirGanjalf> too... much... cgi
<cachi01> thats good news
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I have yet to see any appreciable plot, and I am disappoint
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka I'm trying to think of a plot joke, but this is Star Wars . . .
<RosePetal> So much WHITE!
<Dark92Enigma> Cliche #234: Relying too much on CGI
<Darf14> needs more bloom
<Quick_Thinker> has anyone played Jedi Outcast where you go to Yavin and get training on sabers and watch as teens use actual sabers to fight
<twilight_sprinkle> Apple aliens
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Because it's one galaxy, and the canon of Star Wars has only established a few hundred planets as canonical members of the Republic. :p
<Lunar_Brony> kirzstryfe you beat me to a plot joke
<Tovler> I gotta say, I'll be annoyed if the Oceans Trilogy doesn't get played before this summer event ends.
<SirGanjalf> iPlanet
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I'm always on the lookout for a good plot :3
<owloysius> what happened in the last 10 minutes?
<Darf14> these are the cleanest aliens in the galaxy
<cachi01> SirGanjalf: xD
<RosePetal> "And they will totally not betray you"
<Lunar_Brony> kirzstryfe then why are you watching Star Wars?
<Dark92Enigma> THE PLOT! IT DID NOTHING!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: there can be a lot more they havent shown
<SirGanjalf> cachi01: credit to twilight_sprinkle
<Tovler> space Italy
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts kirzstryfe's plot.
<RustyMeat> THis is so painful
<Discord> LOVE MADE ANAKIN GO EVIL
<RosePetal> Love story again.
<cachi01> god even the men alien has boobs
<StrayPony> Did these clone army payments just fall off the budget? clones aint cheap to feed!
<twilight_sprinkle> SirGanjalf: haw?
<Quick_Thinker> oh shut up handmaiden
<Obsidian> No one cares
<RustyMeat> HOW ROMANTIC TELL US MORE
<Dark92Enigma> TELL A STORY!!!!!!!!!!!!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6just because you can't see the plot doesn't mean I cannot :P
<twilight_sprinkle> SirGanjalf: oh nvm
<Meanwhile> kirz: This one's flat and bony.
<Kandarihu> Probably the most painful thing about Tovler having me on ignore is when he says something that I want to respond to.
<lollerguy> :c
<cachi01> COOL STORY SIS
<Fou_Lou> Discord: nope hate and fear made him
<RustyMeat> LIK MAI CUM
<Darf14> ugh love story, at least its a better love story than Twilight
<Tovler> Pokemon R/B had better dialog.
<RosePetal> I love da water. I love the flowers. Did I mention I love the water.
<RustyMeat> CREEPER
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: So lemme get this straight: you're giving this movie a pass on an absolutely idiotic decision because, and I quote, "there might be more" planets that Lucas hasn't bothered creating yet?
<Shizuka> 13now.. i dunno if you guys remember casino royale well, but isn't this the exact same balcony where that one guy is shot at the end?
<Meanwhile> AND SO ARE YOU.
<lollerguy> ugh
<Cavalluccio_> Sup cachi01 :p
<Discord> Fou_Lou If he hadn't met Padme he would not be evil.
<Tovler> I like shorts. They're comfy and easy to wear.
<cachi01> Fucking E.T for Atari had better dialogue!
<RosePetal> Really?
<spartan133t> OHH GOD NO!
<spartan133t> DONT!
<Ryunosuke> creeper
<SirGanjalf> and i mean EVERYWHERE *wink wink*
<spartan133t> OHH GOD DX
<cachi01> Cavalluccio_: hi!
<RosePetal> NO!
<cratorkid> dont do eeeet
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka it is?
<Meanwhile> You're soft. And smooth. And I want to rub you.
<spartan133t> WHYYYY D:?!
<Squallken> lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> oh god
<cachi01> PEDOPHILE
<RosePetal> Love make you EVILLLLL!
<Shizuka> 13missed opportunity for a record scratch there
<cachi01> PEDO
<spartan133t> YESH!
<Meanwhile> Be creepier Annie.
<Quick_Thinker> my god at least Han was good looking and quite bad ass (in the books his ship blew up and he fixed it twice)
<cachi01> PEDOOOOOO
<spartan133t> :D
<Barbetos> So. The leaders of the Jedi sense that there is something wrong with fate, that it is uncertain, after years and years of not being this way. Suddenly war happens, and they get a clone army dumped on them. At the very least they could sense the evilness in that somewhere? No? Okay.
<lollerguy> rape face activated
<Cavalluccio_> How you doin today ?
<SirGanjalf> dat face:D
<Discord> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL
<RosePetal> Let us KISS!
<owloysius> Shizuka: no, not really. Did that end with someone drinking motor oil, or was that you only die once?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: my opinions are idiotic then? bye, im done wasting your time with my idiocy
<Tovler> I missed the record scratch?
<Discord> CLONE BABIES
<cachi01> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL PEEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOOO
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I just want to establish that you're defending a stupid decision made by stupid people in a stupid movie primarily because you're putting total faith in Lucas.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<OtakuTom> The translation of Zero Wing was written better than this movie
<Squallken> lol
<Ryunosuke> OH COME ON
<Meanwhile> Nope.
<Lunar_Brony> no
<RosePetal> Too late.
<Shooeie> YA THINK
<owloysius> YODO!
<lollerguy> denied motherfucker!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Which makes no sense.
<Lunar_Brony> by "I'm sorry" he means "I regret nothing"
<Shizuka> 13star wars, continuing the tradition of letting powerpoint do your scene transitions
<Fou_Lou> Discord: thats a point. but its hard to tell what happend if they never met. he wouldnt probably a jedi and still a slave on tatooine
<RosePetal> Test tube babies.
<cachi01> HOW DID NATALIE PORTMAN ACCEPTED HIS SHITTY SCRIPT?
<StinkomanFan> ALL THESE EXTRAS HAVE NAMES
<Garretbrony> THX 1138
<CriticKitten> Clones: superior to droids, except when they're not
<RosePetal> She needed money man.
<Shamroc> Shizuka..and its the SAME ONE over and over again..
<Tovler> I like how you can press refresh a skip several seconds of this movie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, Valve has more to lose pissing customers off since they don't trade.
<StinkomanFan> ALL THESE EXTRAS HAVE NAMES
<Shizuka> 13StinkomanFan: amazingly, they're all named Gary
<RosePetal> I blame the economy.
<RosePetal> I love this soup.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: they mentioned many times throughout this film they dont have enough jedi.
<cachi01> Shizuka: Gary's Mod
<Darf14> clones! clones everywhere
<CriticKitten> That's right. They can make clones in only HALF a lifetime now!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They don't have investors to hold them when their PR goes south
<Quick_Thinker> so they all based off of jango so in a way he never dies
<Shizuka> 13oh my god cachi01
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: When?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01.
<cachi01> xd
<Shizuka> 13you discovered the secret!
<Tovler> Which is more iPoddy, This or Star Trek 2009?
<Shizuka> 13someone went around spamming the NPC tool!
<RosePetal> THIS.
<OtakuTom> Aperture Science decided to create their own test subjects instead of paying random passers by.
<Ryunosuke> "I think I'm a clone now, there's always two of me just hanging around"
<otakon> Republic Clone Trooper was a great game
<Darf14> The down side to these clones is that they have energy weapon skills of 0
<cachi01> THAT EXPLAINS IT!
<Discord> I love star wars republic commando. They should have made a second one.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: well i remember several times in the end, it was the reason they accepted the army.
<Lunar_Brony> I want to make a joke about housewives, but I'm not a stupid bastard
<otakon> that's it!
<Thrackerzod> Discord its being kicked arround
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: so you can raise a whole army in 10 years. why not
<kirzstryfe> 8,6what's the change?
<Quick_Thinker> NO TAKE THE ORIGNAL MUSIC OUT NOW FUCK YOU MOVIE
<RosePetal> Too late.
<otakon> OH GOD NOT MORE GODDAMN ROMANCE!
<RosePetal> NOOOO!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: They state that the Jedi cannot fight the entire clone army, yes. But that's because there are millions of droids. >_>
<Ryunosuke> jesus
<Obsidian> brb again
<cachi01> Fou_Lou: hitler ould y not them?
<Tovler> Jar Jar, save us from this monotone.
<Quick_Thinker> FUCK YOU TO THE CAVES UNDER CANTERLOT CASTLE
<Ryunosuke> Even Twilight's love story is better than this
<Dark92Enigma> OOOOOOOH I wonder WHO of all of them will turn EVIL, except for ALL OF THEM?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6./run adv dup
<otakon> Twilight is a better love story
<Lil_B> looks like a Final Fantasy Background
<cachi01> Ryunosuke: NO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Funny how the guy proving the "good guys" army is the same guy trying to kill him.
<Fou_Lou> cachi01: WHAT?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Thousands of Jedi still can't kill millions of droids in a pitched battle, as this movie (tries to) show.
<RosePetal> At least these people have emotion unlike Bella.
<Discord> JUST GET BACK TO THE FUCKING ACTIOAN
<Garretbrony> RosePetal say what you want about the prequal. Their Soundtracks are Awesome
<Darf14> Im in love... oh no.... Im going to the Dark Side~ :O
<Shizuka> 13she's wearing miniature beehives on her ears
<otakon> CriticKitten: hundred
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're putting a "No class action lawsuit" clause in their ToS.
<Shizuka> 13she heard it's all the buzz
<RosePetal> Where's the action!
<Quick_Thinker> for the love of god stop preaching
<otakon> CriticKitten: hundreds*
<Meanwhile> I don't think your acting lessons worked...
<Azura> who's steaming
<CriticKitten> otakon: I'm fairly certain it's thousands.
<Thrackerzod> Fasicism
<Azura> *streaming
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: since when there still theusands of jedis left. Try a few hundred
<cachi01> SHUT UP AND HAVE SEX
<Tovler> back away slowly...
<cachi01> i mean... lets get...
<Shizuka> 13suddenly
<otakon> CriticKitten: I'm fairly certain it's hundreds
<cachi01> to the war
<Shizuka> 13we're in the sound of music
<kirzstryfe> 8,6like every company is adding into their ToS now, because people get sue-happy at the drop of a hat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://store.steampowered.com/news/8523/
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord I can defend the movie, but I really don't care
<cachi01> yeah to the war
<Tovler> giant fleas!
<otakon> GET ON WITH IT MOVIE!
<Discord> Weird animal cow things
<Shizuka> 13LOOK AT ALL THE FUCKS WE GIVE ABOUT THIS ROMANCE
<CriticKitten> otakon: Got a source handy?
<RosePetal> Silly Padme, it's not winter yet. You can't wear earmuffs in the spring.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's true sadly.
<Quick_Thinker> someone wise hmmmmmmm WHY NOT PICK hhmmmmmm Princess Leia Organa
<Garretbrony> Shizuka also by fox
<Lunar_Brony> Get on with it.
<Discord> GIANT FLEAS
<otakon> oh look, surprise giant space fleas
<spartan133t> WTF IS THAT THING!?!
<Azura> cachi01: lol, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY PENIS
<Dark92Enigma> SUDDENLY CHASE!
<Thrackerzod> Shizuka well if it wasnt so damn fake
<cachi01> Azura: xD
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka I don't see any
<RosePetal> Let's frolic in the field.
<Meanwhile> Planet needs a bath...
<Lil_B> Push over the Cows
<RosePetal> Cgi.
<Squallken> your right this is the sound of music
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In part, our sue-happy culture brought it on themselves.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: according to wiki, there are 460 planets. even two jedi per planet is a lot
<cachi01> YES DED
<cachi01> YES"
<Ryunosuke> suddenly trampled
<RosePetal> ded?
<Dark92Enigma> OH NO, IS HE DEAD?????? I WONDER OF HE WILL SURVIVE LIKE ------------SON OF A BITCH
<Quick_Thinker> I HATE YOU ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
<Darf14> did he die?
<cratorkid> still a better love story the twilight :P
<Meanwhile> If only.
<Azura> finally
<Darf14> Troll
<Meanwhile> If only.
<RosePetal> He's not dead
<SirGanjalf> :(
<Lil_B> He's not dead... yet :|
<cachi01> then sex
<OtakuTom> I can just imagine...Vader, 20 years later, after the Empire is destroyed..."I should have worn a condom, then my kids wouldn't have defeated me."
<Tovler> Wookiepedia? What are those space fleas called?
<Dark92Enigma> NOT QUITE DEAD
<RosePetal> Rolling in the grass is FUN!
<Ryunosuke> anakin skywalker trampled, end of series
<shaggypenguin> i feel smexy today
<Meanwhile> Quick, flea thing, kill them both before they can keep taking up screentime.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Costing consumers and companies money over trivial matters.
<Quick_Thinker> hi thing from jurrasic park
<shaggypenguin> very smexy
<Shizuka> 13obi wan immediately fails a spot check
<Dark92Enigma> OH MY GOD
<RosePetal> Dinosaurs in Kamino.
<Lil_B> I like how they just hold the frame during the screenwhipe
<twilight_sprinkle> booba
<Discord> Sure ^^ -looks at obi oddly-
<cachi01> Quick_Thinker: pterodyctyl lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But without fair trail, companies can abuse the law to get their way.
<RosePetal> Boba Fett.
<Quick_Thinker> and fans stormed out of the theater in rage
<Lunar_Brony> cratorkid I can't believe I'm saying this, but yeah, you're right
<cachi01> dat Eeyup
<Meanwhile> Eeyup.
<Garretbrony> BOBA !!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Except criminal law.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6actually, they provide a reasonable arguement for the change
<lollerguy> shu
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<RosePetal> Hello Boba and Jango Fett.
<Darf14> Boba, the greates badass in the galaxy
<Dark92Enigma> BOBBA FETT
<cachi01> boba fett jango fett
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I appreciate that.
<Meanwhile> I like the weather.
<cachi01> lol boba
<RosePetal> So was his father.
<Tovler> ib4 young Han Solo shows up for no reason.
<OtakuTom> 1...2...JANGO!
<Shizuka> 13obi wan fails a detect bluff check... and another.... and another...
<otakon> CriticKitten: I was wrong, according to the books it was about 9000 before the Battle of Genosis and Order 66.
<SirGanjalf> Jenga Fett
<Shizuka> 13you know obi wan... just get a new d20... you suck at this
<otakon> Shizuka: mandalorian
<Ryunosuke> that mandalorian
<Tovler> Django Unleashed
<Quick_Thinker> man obi wan sucks at the D20 system
<RosePetal> The Fetts are badass.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6and most issues that would result in a class action would more liklely originate in a product, not in Valve's services itself
<Dark92Enigma> BOBBA FETT............is this KID????????
<shaggypenguin> my name is wat
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT THE FUCK?
<Discord> YES
<kirzstryfe> 8,6at least what I can think of
<otakon> Shizuka: they're immune to force mind skills
<shaggypenguin> my name is who
<Discord> YOU IDIOT
<RosePetal> Boba Fett IS the kid.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just feel betrayed.
<CriticKitten> otakon: Yeah I had thought it was a lot. According to this source I'm reading, there are 200 Jedi alone in the pitched battle later in this movie.
<Discord> AND IT'S BOBA
<shaggypenguin> my name is boba
<Quick_Thinker> yep Dark thats BOBA FETT YOU MAD?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<otakon> where is Bronysith?
<RosePetal> He's okay.
<Quick_Thinker> CUASE IM PISSED
<otakon> oh there he is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because jumping on the 'take power away from the consumer" bandwagon is more of an EA/Activision thing.
<Lunar_Brony> otakon beats me
<Discord> PFFFFFFFFT
<Bronysith> otakon: ping?
<RaveBrony> :D
<Discord> buffer
<cratorkid> that kids glare
<RosePetal> I didn't really care.
<Shizuka> 13boba fett.. less on screen importance than derpy.... ten times the popularity
<Lunar_Brony> ohai Bronysith
<cachi01> jenga fett?
<otakon> Bronysith: you watching Ep. 2?
<Shizuka> 13PREVIOUSLY ON DESPERATE HOUSEJEDIS
<Darf14> lol
<RaveBrony> LOL
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the jedi order is like the SS but religious
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol Shizuka.
<Bronysith> otakon: im finishing up dead money
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal: i KNOW......but i still feel angry.........as well as Quick_Thinker
<otakon> Shizuka: Derpy is the Boba of our fandom
<CriticKitten> Ah Jango Fett. His entire existence is hollow fan service.
<Quick_Thinker> a pleasure to meet a jedi hmm that means hes killed a few ( he did in the bount hunterr games)
<Darf14> time to GTFO
<Ryunosuke> FOCUS MOVIE, FOCUS
<CriticKitten> Dat dialogue
<Darf14> nope, my food!
<Kandarihu> Laser Diplomacy
<Meanwhile> Yoink.
<Discord> Dat showing off
<RosePetal> Dats my food.
<cachi01> yeah bitch ITS MINE
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> was that scene even needed?
<Tovler> if Derpy is Boba, does that mean she'll die in season 3?
<otakon> Atton Rand could show Jango a few tricks
<RaveBrony> Grumpy! :[
<Garretbrony> Ryunosuke ADHD IN SPACE: The Movie
<CriticKitten> VERY GRUMPLY
<lollerguy> fucking show off
<RosePetal> No!
<Lunar_Brony> I want to do stuff like that. I would never have to leave this chair again
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> UNWANTED SCENE
<OtakuTom> She's a senator, and personally knows Jedi...how does she NOT know what "aggressive negotiatons" are?
<Lunar_Brony> the floaty stuff
<otakon> WHO KNOWS OF ATTON RAND?!
<Quick_Thinker> why not use what you have i mean Twi use magic all the time to do such simple task such as turn a page or open a door
<Shizuka> 13hey lucas... mind having some lighting in this scene? can't see a thing capn
<Discord> JUST SHUT.. UP
<Lil_B> Wrek|Observiking funny comparison... Geroge Lucas said he got a lot of inspiration from WW2 Documents and footage... and that Palpetines rise to power is totally like Hitlers
<StinkomanFan> SHOWOFFY PRICK
<RosePetal> There's no point of this scene.
<Ryunosuke> otakon, I do

<Lunar_Brony> . . . THE MOVIE ISN'T HALF OVER?!?!?!?
<Reikim> More resurrections than DBZ.
<Lil_B> damnit, that short buffering was a good freeze-frame but I was too slow
<Shizuka> 13RosePetal: union break
<Darf14> This is the assassin were looking for
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Jim> hi Reikim

<RosePetal> No, but there's more action.
*Garretbrony glomps RosePetal
<Quick_Thinker> the singal is shit with this one
<CriticKitten> Yoda, the real villains are ABSURDLY OBVIOUS
<Dken2021> so has the movie gone anywhere after I 've been gone for 5 minutes?

<Marx> Ever authorize the creation of buffering? I hope not.
<otakon> SCREENCAP IT!
<lollerguy> welp
<Lil_B> I'm gonna use this :3
<Reikim> And that one time with RAWRity and otakon
<Fou_Lou> but i have to say. robocop 2 was better than this
<Quick_Thinker> the buffer-o-meter is OFF THE CHARTS
<Discord> OH COME ONE
<lollerguy> *sleep*
<ponibas> mace, best part of the movie

<otakon> Meanwhile: lol yes
<Dken2021> wow, this whole movie is filler
*Garretbrony glomps Shizuka
<Kandarihu> I think I got up to the point where Shizuka restarted the stream, but we seem to all be having the buffer
<GabeMoist> Obi-Wan's message to the council is buffering
<Shizuka> 13and lost connection on that one
<Reikim> Just hangin' out here while trying to write something and monitoring my Minecraft server =.=

*Discord leaves to catch a flight to hawaii for 5 months until it stops buffering
<Lunar_Brony> Thrackerzod read Garretbrony 's message
<RosePetal> I lost the movie picture.
<Thrackerzod> yup
<Reikim> DBZ: what Bleach tried to be, right down to the lack of planning on the author's side.
<Dken2021> oh thank goodness, though it was just on my end
<Darf14> Derpy must be in charge of Mips again
<Thrackerzod> Shizuka we may have something great here

<Dken2021> and we're back
<Lil_B> damnit...
<Discord> OH COME ON!
*Dark92Enigma Cause this is FILLER! (claps) FILLER TIME! an hour and a half is just too long for uncreative minds!!!!! WHOO-HOO!!!!
<Meanwhile> Getsuga is Ichigo's one actual technique.

<Meanwhile> Herp ALL the derp.
<Tovler> Blind, we are
<Quick_Thinker> yes you are vey dumb yoda
<Lil_B> another?
<Azura> Yoda really became blind at this state
<Reikim> Oh and here I assumed that wacking things with a sword constituted technique
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> lol now Yoda stares down the buffer xD
<RustyMeat> buffer monster strikes again
<Reikim> OH WELL
<ponibas> and ded again
<CriticKitten> http://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w467/CriticKitten/MaceWindubufferingcomcast.jpg <--- There we go. Seems fitting.
<Tovler> buffering, we are
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> SCREEN CAP
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol
<Shizuka> 13again..
<RustyMeat> yoda is dissapooint in buffer

<cachi01> http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24248021.jpg
<StormFox> LOL
<Darf14> Yoda is staring at the buffer circle :D
<Dark92Enigma> CriticKitten Win.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Funny how Bleached turned into DBZ during the Soul Society arc. They took a 5-episode arc and made it 5x as long.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*Bleach
<Dark92Enigma> THE BUFFER IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE
<Squallken> and I was about to use the "BAD ACTING" gig
<StormFox> no his thinking to himself 'If I think hard enough the buffer will disappear' X3
<applehoof> :[ Your going to play!!
<Lunar_Brony> somepony screenshot that and caption it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My brain broke again.
<CriticKitten> ....Yoda's face....
*CriticKitten screencaps again. >.>
<Darf14> dang forgot how to screencap >_<
<Garretbrony> Stop FILLER TIME. Cant Watch This OOOoOOOOO
<StinkomanFan> Look at that face
<Tovler> what's Yoda looking at?
<Reikim> Bleached: Sounds like a romantic comedy revolving around a dry cleaner's.
<StinkomanFan> That face of malice
<ponibas> Yoda: Stream, disappoint I am
<Lunar_Brony> how do you screencap?
<CriticKitten> It looks like he's constipated.
<RosePetal> Steams still broken.
<GabeMoist> Yoda: Why Buffer?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<Kandarihu> Yoda is using Force Buffering
<Lunar_Brony> RosePetal Steam or Stream?
<RosePetal> I think She's fixing it.
<Darf14> quick, somepony screencap it
<Lunar_Brony> Darf14 somepony did already
<RosePetal> I think someone already it.
<Discord> :[
<Darf14> yay :)
<Dken2021> have fun with it http://imgur.com/JGShc
<ponibas> fairly certain that we might read news articles about a young woman going bezerk in her local Comcast office
<Garretbrony> Tovler dat ashtray
<twilight_sprinkle> Darf14 Lunar_Brony press prnt scrn button then paste it in a program like paint or photoshop
<ponibas> berzerk*
<Reikim> That...that could actually work.

<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: but his eyes are closed!
<Reikim> Nah, I don't have the time.

<SirGanjalf> aww, that scene would fit even better
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder if the Fluttershy room will pick the same movies again?
<RustyMeat> hmmm?
<RosePetal> lol buffer jokes.
<Dken2021> Nittany_Discord and those are?
<Tovler> Garretbrony: actually it was the hologram projector and it just went off /buzzkillington
<Darf14> man you guys are fast at adding captions
<Marx> Man, We're getting some good screenshots.

<ponibas> Shizu, not your fault
<Darf14> thats ok Shizuka , blame Comcast
<Lil_B> how much of the movie is left anyways?
<GabeMoist> Buffer is a rogue agent
<Marx> Sounds like it Dken.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the viewers are having fun with buffer jokes with its being sorted ^_^
<RosePetal> An hour I think.

<Wrek|Observiking> 05see that line?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05dont cross it
<Ryunosuke> the buffer leads to the dark side
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, what ISPs are competing with Comcast in your area?
<Garretbrony> CriticKitten say this I am Tired of these MutherFucken Buffers on this Motherfucken Stream
<Lil_B> man... I don't think I will make it through the movie today if that keeps happening :(
<Shizuka> 13none
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i think kirzstryfe kame hame ha got cancelled
<Darf14> Yoda can sense buffer a mile away
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek|Observiking I C no line
<Shizuka> 13or rather
<Shizuka> 13it's comcast
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Comcast owns Minnesota

<AttacktheAndalite> What happened to stream?
<Reikim2> OH MY GOD
<Kandarihu> Is there anything stopping you from moving out of Minnesota?
<Reikim2> Is it five episodes later already?
<Lunar_Brony> AttacktheAndalite the Fire Nation attacked
<owloysius> Garretbrony: nah, saturn isn't there
<Kandarihu> AttacktheAndalite, Comcast happened to the stream
<kirzstryfe> 8,6:3

<Lunar_Brony> Barbetos what?
<Reikim2> Dat pacing like a geriatric octogenarian.
*Dovah extremely pissed of at father.
<Azura> -____________-
<Garretbrony> Shizuka I thought you lived in Japan
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/3ydTy.jpg
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohhh they changed champions already ... i was having fun with skarner
<Lunar_Brony> Dovah better to be pissed off than pissed on
<Shooeie> So Star Wars is canceled?
<Shizuka> 13if i did... i would have much better internet..
<otakon> Shizuka: is it nice there?
<Meanwhile> I'm always having fun with Nocturne.
<Barbetos> Lunar_Brony Clicked the wrong link in the newsletter and removed myself from doing any more surveys for movie night.
<Reikim> And I...kind of have fun with Morgana?
<Shizuka> 13in minnesota... no
*otakon hugs Shizuka "It's okay dear, shit happens"
<Garretbrony> Meanwhile I love you
<Lunar_Brony> Barbetos *cringes*
<otakon> Shizuka: well that sucks
<AttacktheAndalite> How is everyone able to catch these awesome buffer shots but I can't?
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/8sm8P.jpg
<Garretbrony> Shizuka Probably
<Reikim> I dunno, getting three Deathcaps gets old after the third or fourth time you do it :3
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: XD
<otakon> Meanwhile: lol man
<Barbetos> Why is that link even there? D=
<Dovah> I mean honestly? what the buck is so hard to undersand about useing a credit card to buy things online?????
<cachi01> exile!
<ponyfromPR> lol mines still buffering with a black screen :[
<otakon> welp, I'm off to try out Fall of Cybertron
<Wrek|Observiking> 05http://i.imgur.com/ywWxx.png
<Barbetos> For stupid blondes like me I guess.
<Tovler> Wow, … if any brony appears on the Jerry Springer Show...
<cachi01> mine is yoda staring at the buffer
<otakon> ping me when it comes back
<CriticKitten> Also which font is that you're using?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If there was a competing broadband ISP, Shizuka's family's internet bill would be lower.
<AttacktheAndalite> I've set up a buffer folder just for this
<Meanwhile> Two buffer images for the price of one. T'is an interesting one.
<CriticKitten> 's got a nice pop to it.
<Garretbrony> MEME incoming
<Meanwhile> Wrek: You got the untexted image?
<CriticKitten> Wrek: lol
<Reikim> Who's free right now? I'm too lazy to wait an hour for my client to patch.
<SayWhat> I'm runing low on pony fuel, I need to do something related to refill it D:
<Shizuka> 13indeed... $75 for 12/4 as is...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I bet it's why I paid less for faster internet in PA than Shizuka.
<Lunar_Brony> I use Shaw
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Meanwhile: dont think so
<SayWhat> Any stream going?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm using gragas
<Meanwhile> Wrek: Bugger. Alas.
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, if you're not bound to where you live, you should move to Chattanooga. Best ISP in the country is here, besides the lack of IPv6.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because Verizon was also in the area offering DSL and FiOS.
<Garretbrony> Shizuka lemme Guess Eden Praire Internet?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05what!?
<GabeMoist> We need an album of all the Buffering images
*AttacktheAndalite has a buffer joke folder on Chrome just for this
<Shizuka> 13north metro
<Lunar_Brony> hi SayWhat. Not AtM
<Wrek|Observiking> 0575 bucks could give you more or less 1gbit here >.>
<Meanwhile> I had a guy playing Gragas earlier, walked into turrets twice within the space of five minutes.
<Shizuka> 13further into the cities we could at least have DSL as a fallback
<SayWhat> Here's some words of the wise: Don't do Century Link
*Reikim facepalms
<Wrek|Observiking> 05outrageous
<CriticKitten> Century Link lol
<Ryunosuke> umm
<Reikim> It's really fun when you get someone with stun like Morgana
<Meanwhile> Ironically not a bad player, just horrible timing.
<CriticKitten> The only company possibly worse than Comcast
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Comcast was actually good to me at least in PA.
<SayWhat> Gotta go again D: Be back later
<ponyfromPR> lol yah
<Sumica> 00,10Shizuka, how far in?
<Reikim> Unfortunate
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess that branch operates differently than the MN branch.
<ponyfromPR> ok bye SayWhat
<Shizuka> 13a bit under an hour
<Shizuka> 13like
<otakon> nvm
<Lunar_Brony> Don't do Telus either. Customer Service gets you connected to Mongolia probably
<CriticKitten> 56 minute mark according to this buffer, Sumi
<Shizuka> 1355:00 or so
<Shizuka> 13or that
<GabeMoist> Sumica, 56:08
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0156:08 in Sumica.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6issue I had with LoL when I tried it was how you could chain stun for far too long
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's where the stream froze at.
*CriticKitten nods
<otakon> my goddamn 360 decided to dc itself for SOME reason at 97% dl
<RustyMeat> indeed
<FlareChaser> Hey Guys, I'm in Vancouver.
<FlareChaser> ._.
<Reikim> Only if your opponent is retarded, and only on some matchups
<CriticKitten> Rainbow Dash always buffers in style.
<otakon> I've been waiting 3 hours for a 2 gb download
<Dken2021> thank goodness for that timestamp
<Meanwhile> Stunlocking is a totally valid strat.
<FlareChaser> What should I do? ._.
<otakon> hiya FlareChaser how are you?
<Lunar_Brony> FlareChaser /)
<Ryunosuke> I pay like $25 for like 8mb dsl
<Dken2021> hai FlareChaser , how is it?
<Lunar_Brony> hi
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Verizon actually offers a no-cap internet.
<Garretbrony> FlareChaser hey thats where MLP FiM is Made
<cachi01> hi FlareChaser!
<Reikim> You have to either get a really good team or a really stupid opponent
<otakon> FlareChaser: eat some Canadian Bacon and wrestle a moose
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just hated their customer service.
<FlareChaser> Garretbrony, I know ._.
<Dark92Enigma> OK.....i'll be waiting for the movie to start again
<cachi01> FlareChaser: bring me some bacon
<FlareChaser> otakon, thats racist ._.

<Squallken> cool
<Garretbrony> I am in Neighbraska and the Internet is fine
<Tovler> Wow… nobody picked Inception for A movie. I'm suprised.
<Lunar_Brony> thank you Sumica

<Shooeie> yay
<kirzstryfe> 8,6stop pinging him or I'll start kicking people
<ponyfromPR> YAY
<Reikim> My problem that I always have with LoL is that as the game progresses I have a tendency to walk into roaming packs of three to five opponents.
<Shooeie> yay
<RustyMeat> I know
<Shooeie> omg
<XylemTube> yay
<RustyMeat> I wanted to hear whoah
<Shooeie> stop pinging him

<Kandarihu> Sorry about that.
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<cachi01> OH MY
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<ponyfromPR> the drama, it BURNS
<RaveBrony> Lol!!
<CriticKitten> Because that's clearly what that thing is
<Lunar_Brony> stupid love scene . . .
<RaveBrony> That oh my :D
<Nightflames> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten but collars are hot :P
<Lunar_Brony> DAAAAHHH!!!
<Reikim> After a certain point they start grouping up for teamfights
<otakon> TWILIGHT IS A BETTER LOVE STORY THAN THIS!
<RustyMeat> creepy
<Discord> LOL WUT?
<otakon> there I said it
<Darf14> anything he said
<Lunar_Brony> all dem pings is annoying!!
<Dark92Enigma> THE DRAMA! IT BURNS!!!!!
<ponyfromPR> lol
<Reikim> Usually, eh, past level 15 or so.
<Meanwhile> Tbh though I usually play against bots because in PVP my team is usually far more hostile.
*twilight_sprinkle slaps otakon
<cachi01> YES YOU CAN BUT YOU MUST'NT
<Meanwhile> ERMAHGERD WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK SMITE AND GO JUNGLE
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: what was that for?
<Meanwhile> Because I prefer laning.
<Garretbrony> otakon I know the Twilight x BigMac Fanfics are a staple of Romance Fiction
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: But collar dresses aren't. They look dumb, and can't possibly be easy to put on or remove.
<Meanwhile> REPORTEEEEEEED
<XylemTube> *Senators not allowed to fuck people*
<Reikim> I play bots when I feel like having fun.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon youve gone too far :I
<Dark92Enigma> Aww boo hoo.........let me play a sad song for you in the world's smallest violin!"
<Discord> WE WERE FARTHUR IN SUMICA
<Lunar_Brony> otakon I haven't read Twilight or seen the movie, so I can't say anything in reply
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: I'm sorry I HATE these goddamn parts
<Reikim> I play PvP when I feel like hating on annoying Brazilians who refuse to communicate.
<Sumica> 00,10that's nice.
<otakon> Discord: no we must SUFFER
<Garretbrony> Dark92Enigma leave that to John Williams
<Dark92Enigma> You are TEARING ME APART, PADME!
<CriticKitten> It's like she tried to pick the most S&M dress in her entire closet
<Meanwhile> Really, people in LoL get way too angry.
<Lunar_Brony> discord be happy the stream is up
<otakon> SUFFER WE MUST!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Discord yapyapyap
<Tovler> 177 kicks that's pretty impressive.
<Sumica> 00,10considder this a recap
<ponyfromPR> yay
<Meanwhile> Mordekaiser es numero uno. Huehuehue.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten eh, idk whats a collar dress, bit the one she has doesnt seem too bad
<otakon> And I haven't been spam kicked ONCE this evening
<Garretbrony> Live in a lie TImmy

<Dark92Enigma> Garretbrony: Of course.....

<Wrek|Observiking> 05otakon: that oculd be arranged
<AttacktheAndalite> inb4 otakon gets kicked just for shits an giggles
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: This one is the one I mean. It looks impractical and stupid.
<otakon> Wrek|Observiking: I said SPAM kicked
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: Congratulations.
<Lunar_Brony> otakon IMPOSSIBRU!!
<Reikim> I mean, it never was, but now it's just annoying.
<AttacktheAndalite> This is episode 2, right?
<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: eeyup
<Lunar_Brony> AttacktheAndalite eeyup
<AttacktheAndalite> okaaay
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten its not for being practical, is for..nights :P
<Meanwhile> otakon: http://i.imgur.com/kQXZW.jpg
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Remove the collar bit and it's a very pretty dress. With it on, I'm forced to ask how the fuck she puts it on.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05try now otakon
<Tovler> Our troops aren't born, Neo. They're grown
<Ryunosuke> inb4 more buffering
<Lil_B> could they have cloned a Je3di to make a Jedi Army?
<Meanwhile> Huehue.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That black dress? Not really that great.
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile I don't get it . . .
<ponyfromPR> i love clones my fav is one of the ones that didnt follow order 66
<Garretbrony> AttacktheAndalite why did Obiwan take laughing gas and LaxativeS?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten it is however dangerous adding that thing that connects the collar to the dress
<Saturn> 08,01Garretbrony?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: "Oh Anakin, I love you but we can't be together, so I'm going to tease you with my S&M slave collar dress instead."
<StormFox> you would think Discor XD
<otakon> Wrek|Observiking: not gonna fall for it.
<Lunar_Brony> ohai Saturn
<Garretbrony> AttacktheAndalite: for shits and Giggles
<AttacktheAndalite> Garretbrony: I don't know....

<Darf14> howdy Saturn
<Garretbrony> Hey Saturn

<Fou_Lou> Lil_B: interesting thought. But i doubt that wont work make much difference
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ye sadist >:3
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile, I don't get
<Lunar_Brony> all dem pings
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ...?
<otakon> hiya Saturn and yes I'm sure Wrek|Observiking no spamkick for me tonight.
<Garretbrony> AttacktheAndalite: for shits and Giggles
<Meanwhile> dari, you alive?
<AttacktheAndalite> Garretbrony: Ohhhhhh
<GabeMoist> Wrek|Observiking, I think you have that mixed up?
<Reikim> Also, when teammates ask for leash when I'm already set up on mid.
<AttacktheAndalite> Hai Saturn
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Well he has a lot of mommy issues....I mean wut. :DS

<CriticKitten> God I had a terrible dream that I was the star actor in a shitty Star Wars movie

<Lunar_Brony> Dark92Enigma dont' hurt yourself
<Discord> The screen keeps freezing on my end
<Dark92Enigma> THE ACTING! IT DID NOTHING!
<otakon> you know they had sex, her hair is down.
<Kandarihu> otakon, congratulations on not getting spamkicked.
<Discord> but the audio keeps going
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Creeper

<Lil_B> hi Spriggals

<ponyfromPR> so boreing
<Reikim> Heh, you're actually above me I think
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I just put in my lottery choice
<Reikim> Maybe
<twilight_sprinkle> Discord: mines fine, must be your computer glitching
<Meanwhile> I mean, I can jungle, but I don't like to.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05SeaponiesofLiverpool; yeah where have oyu been?
<cachi01> I WANNA BE A JEDI SO I CAN DREAM WITH ´PONYVILLE =D
<CriticKitten> Jedi don't have nightmares. Nightmares are forbidden.
<Discord> SO BOOORING
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its trilogy night
<otakon> Kandarihu: thanks but I'm sure Wrek|Observiking has it set to some ridiculous count, like 2 in 10 or some such.
<ponyfromPR> AGGHH :(
<ponibas> ddddddd
<Reikim> I'm only like level 15
<Meanwhile> It's bloody boring.
<ponibas> :p
<Dken2021> SeaponiesofLiverpool trilogies have bee nplaying this summer
*Dark92Enigma i knew i shouldn't left her in the first movie
<Discord> Sumica can you skip these parts?
<Reikim> I tried jungling with Lee Sin when he was free.
<CriticKitten> Very specific dream.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I've been making a half dozen pony songs
<Fou_Lou> otakon: lets count to find it out ^-^
<ponyfromPR> yay
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I don't have nightmares just very vivid dreams
<Reikim> It works, only I can't gank for crap because I don't have the runes to do it.
<SirGanjalf> Do Jedi dream of electric Gungans?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05^_^
<CriticKitten> "I saw my mother, she's in pain."
<otakon> Fou_Lou: have fun
<Dken2021> also, hai SeaponiesofLiverpool
<Spriggals> The only badass part in this episode is when the clones come in
<CriticKitten> YES YOU DO
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Hope my A movie gets picked
<ponyfromPR> electric gungans? :D
<CriticKitten> YOU HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE.
<Garretbrony> SirGanjalf only if they are replicant Jedis
<CriticKitten> >_>
<Meanwhile> Nocturne is great for jungling, which is what makes it doable, but goddamn it's just dull.
<StormFox> finally a fight scene
<Dken2021> Jango!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Dune (2000)
<cachi01> i dont have nightmares just dreams that are not nice and scary
<Kandarihu> SirGanjalf, Star Wars fans dream of electrified Gungans
<Lunar_Brony> Discord never complian about the stream. You know the consequences
<Fou_Lou> otakon: no you must count. youre the one wrek has a special rules for
<Ryunosuke> you can inform the counsel like you were told to you fool
<ponyfromPR> pew pew pew
<Darf14> Badass mode activated
<otakon> Fou_Lou: not a chance inn hell
<Wrek|Observiking> 05oh look i didnt knwo were were watching SWTOR gameplay
<CriticKitten> Oh hey I almost forgot this was Star Wars and there are lightsabers and fights in it
<Reikim> Nocturne's better going around messing shit up in lane.
<Fou_Lou> otakon: awww
<otakon> FINALLY THE MISSILE IS USED!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> would that be considered 1 movie or a trilogy?
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon is so loved he gets his own special rule.
<Tovler> nice, back aimin skills
<ponibas> He, got a problem with that, Wrek?! :p
<RustyMeat> KICK
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek|Observiking: thats some cool gameplay
<Garretbrony> otakon what about in Heavan?
<Reikim> I mean, he is literally one of the scariest champs to come up against alone.
<CriticKitten> I was just SO entranced by the political discussions and shitty love story
<Darf14> and not a scratch on the Jedi
<Dark92Enigma> THE RAILINGS! THEY DO NOTHING!
<RainRunner> Howdy.
<Meanwhile> Exacta
<otakon> Wrek|Observiking: now changet it back, I don't want to get spam kicked.
<Dken2021> SeaponiesofLiverpool well the trilogies haven't been user picked
<Lunar_Brony> hi RainRunner
<AttacktheAndalite> NEEDS MORE RAILINGS
<Darf14> This platform lacks railings
<Reikim> The only one worse is Shaco. *looks behind* AH SHIT RUN FLASHFLASHFLASH
<Wrek|Observiking> 05otakon
<Garretbrony> CriticKitten do you like Battlefront 2
<Tovler> My favorite fight scene. so much tumbling
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Dken2021> howdy RainRunner
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i never changed it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> would Dune (2000) be a trilogy or one movie?
<Meanwhile> He's a monster when you're by yourself.
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: its to get the girls in. You know twilight and stuff
<Discord> OH COME ON
<ponyfromPR> lol :D s true Dark92Enigma
<Lunar_Brony> all the railings jokes!
<otakon> Wrek|Observiking: you LIE! I do not believe you
<Shooeie> Stupid Jedi
<twilight_sprinkle> bountry hunter needs to learn to shoot straight
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Stupid Jedi, Mind Tricks are for kids
<Darf14> This is why you should install adequate railings
<Lunar_Brony> CUT THE ROPE
<StinkomanFan> They just grouped the seeing of the clones and the fight with Jango into one scene in the Lego game
<Lunar_Brony> THANK YOU
<Wrek|Observiking> 05try me
<XylemTube> BULLSHIT
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> how did that happen?
<Ponies47> I played TF2 for about 5 hours agian. DIDN'T I? -_-
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> guys does anypony know?
<StormFox> and he just jumped the shark
*ponibas tries Wrek
<CriticKitten> Obi-Wan is being pwned by a single bounty hunter. Do note these bounty hunters form the basis of the clone army. Yet we're expected to believe that the clones are roughly equal to the shitty droids Obi-Wan mows through,]
<Garretbrony> twilight_sprinkle where did you think all the stromtroppers got their aim from?
<RainRunner> The force
<otakon> fine going back to normal
<CriticKitten> *.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: he had a magnetic rope thing
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> would Dune (2000) be a trilogy or one movie?
<Lunar_Brony> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 it didn't
<Ponies47> and HEY EVERYPONY! :p
<Meanwhile> Very little is quite as distressing as the ability to mark you with a trail that makes him faster and allows him to clip through units. Besides his fear and the ability to absorb your initial spell and gain more attack speed anyway.
<Tovler> the force keeps his joints from dislocating
<twilight_sprinkle> Garretbrony: lol :D
<Dken2021> SeaponiesofLiverpool is it a trilogy?
<otakon> Why can't Boba's armor be that useful?
<Lunar_Brony> hi Ponies47
<Sumica> 00,10wrek we have kick bot now you know?
<Lil_B> ok, I finished my Surve for the lottery :)
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> So you can move objects at will withthe force but you cannot make yourself levitate?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> its a SciFi miniseries
<CriticKitten> So judging from these things, I conclude that power levels in Bleach make more sense than this film.
<Reikim> Really, he's better laning for a bit and then skulking off to assassinate people.
<Garretbrony> deja Vu
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: for each clone comes about 100 droids
<Tovler> dat useless light saber
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> full movie 6 hrs. long
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle: You were talking to Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2
<ponibas> who, fyi, doesn't reply to PMs :p
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> worst ship ever
<Reikim> Lane bot a bit, sneak off to blitz the mid, repeat.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I chose it as A movie
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> 8D
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ssssh
<Dken2021> SeaponiesofLiverpool oh, I don't know then
<Meanwhile> His ultimate is very mentally unfair.
<CriticKitten> Either that or Jedi observe the law of ninjitsu.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: orite, sorry
<Reikim> What does it do again?
<Discord> SeaponiesofLiverpool this movie is 6 hours long?!?!?!
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: the cost is probably the same.
<Bronysith> otakon: thank you sweet merciful sexy molestia. i finished dead money on very hard. hardcore
<Dark92Enigma> the LIGHTSABER! IT DID NOTHING
<Sumica> 00,10Kickbot: make me a sandwich
<otakon> Bronysith: yay
<Discord> Autotuned robot
<Ryunosuke> very inconspicous there annikin
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> well Lawrence of Arabia wasn't disqualified
<Ponies47> Did I really just clsoe the bucking chat by mistake? -_-
<twilight_sprinkle> this movie has cool sounds at least
<Sumica> 00,10oh guess it's off
<otakon> Sumica: what is Wrek|Observiking's kick setting?
<Lunar_Brony> no response?
<Discord> Autotuned robot
<Bronysith> otakon: i never want to see that place again
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> and its about as long
<Meanwhile> Shortens all enemy vision and removes their ability to see allied vision for the duration.
<Ponies47> *close
<Tovler> nice meticulous landing sequence.
<otakon> Bronysith: told you
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle: Nah, don't worry, it happens :)
<Lunar_Brony> kickbot: say something
<RustyMeat> um
<CriticKitten> Mos Eisley! You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
<Ryunosuke> uhh waht?
<XylemTube> DOWN IN FRON
<Dken2021> down in front!
<Ryunosuke> DOWN IN FRONT!
<Reikim> ...Oh shit.
<Discord> I can't see the subtitles!
<Fou_Lou> CrimsonPhoenix: the unual droid seen in ep1 is probably cheap as hell
<Sumica> 00,10FU subs
<Kandarihu> Phew
<Lunar_Brony> Kickbot is off? Aww . . .
<Discord> there we go
<Reikim> That's hell in a big teamfight.
<ponibas> no, it's on, you have to preceed with the :
<CrimsonPhoenix> is that so Fou_Lou?
<Bronysith> otakon: but i made 50k caps
<JESmith71> That Mega Man pony version
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Down in front, ponies! :p
<RosePetal> Back.
<Shooeie> He looks like a deadbeat
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Watto should have been voiced by Mel Brooks
<Fou_Lou> CrimsonPhoenix: damn. wron ping
<ponyfromPR> brb
<Dark92Enigma> Twilight used an invisiblility spell <----------
<Conyst> That's right Watto he is now a Cheddar Monk
<Ryunosuke> he has a beard?
<Sumica> 00,10oh right
<otakon> Bronysith: pfffft, I make 50K caps easy
<ponibas> I demand a Luna!
<RosePetal> That would have been funny.
<CrimsonPhoenix> no problem
<Fou_Lou> CrimsonPhoenix: ping -.- soryy
<Dken2021> he's grown a beard
<Sumica> 00,10:kickbot make me a sandwich
<BerryPunch> Sumica: Not a valid command, silly
<RainRunner> Looks nothing like the kid. Just sayin.
<Bronysith> otakon: i know. but omg that explosions
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord umm, okay. *lies down*
<CriticKitten> Oh, yeah.
<Reikim> If you try to flee by yourself, you run the risk of getting picked off hard.
<StinkomanFan> YER MOM
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love it when I get wrongping
<Lunar_Brony> yay! Kickbot!
<RosePetal> Wow, he hasnt aged since 10 years.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05my name a borat

<CrimsonPhoenix> don't worry
<owloysius> well, that's nedw
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i sold her
<Dark92Enigma> MY MAMA

<Dark92Enigma> SOLD HER?
<CriticKitten> Wrek: It was VERY NICE

<XylemTube> Save mama Luigi!
<Ryunosuke> Owen Lars?
<RosePetal> Married her.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I've been busy making pony music sorry uysg
<Meanwhile> During the time it's active Nocturne can hurl toward an enemy champion for a bit of damage.
<Dark92Enigma> MY CHILDHOOD....
<ponibas> Don't play with kickbot, his masters get angry
<Wrek|Observiking> 05mos isley
<CriticKitten> Except, you know, not there.
<RosePetal> TELL ME!
<Tovler> The time skip gave Watto a doughboy helmet.
<Dken2021> it's cool SeaponiesofLiverpool , nice to have you back

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hey guys, I bet you'll never guess what episode I picked.
<ponyfromPR> :D
<Discord> Sumica I don't get it either
<RosePetal> In space no one can hear explosions.
<CriticKitten> Sumica: No, seismic charges that create sound shockwaves.
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: its prolly not a shockwave of space itself, maybe of some material in the bomb
<Spriggals> Spaaaccceee

<CriticKitten> Well he's flying what amounts to a pre-Rebellion A-Wing so yeah he's kinda fucked
<twilight_sprinkle> 334:99 pm here

<Discord> Bass missile
*Lil_B hugs Dken2021 Lunar_Brony and Fou_Lou

<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat smart missile :O
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<ponyfromPR> Discord :D rofl

<Meanwhile> You write too much.
<RosePetal> Boom!
<Reikim> The only champ I truly fear more is Shaco.
<Sumica> 00,10you would think he would have flares to do that
<Dken2021> this is a clustered ring
<Saturn> 08,01i do, but not much, and not often
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Nice escape plan :D
<twilight_sprinkle> funny, in SW3 rockets couldnt do that. althto maybe droids had cheaper ones
<RainRunner> USE THE BRAKES!
<Reikim> I don't write too much.
<RosePetal> Lol.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> guys?
<ponyfromPR> SCREEEEEEEEE

<spartan133t> Wtf?
<CriticKitten> Sumica: That would make sense though.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat landing :O
<Reikim> I write not often enough, and I come up with too many ideas.

<Dken2021> SeaponiesofLiverpool aure why not?
<RAWRity> GUYS.
<RAWRity> GUYSSSSSSSSS

<Ryunosuke> hey RAWRity
<RosePetal> It's a trap!
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: wut
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :S
<Reikim> It took me three months to finally finish editing my fanfic entry for Bronystate.
<Bronysith> Wrek|Observiking: i have a zippo...but cant go to buck :'(
<Sumica> 00,10well he is the template for storm troopers
<ponibas> Wrek? zippo that someone can spare??
<Lunar_Brony> ohai RAWRity
<RainRunner> Mission Acomplished.
<Fou_Lou> TrixieMuffins: heaseeker. Luggage is hotter than asterois. MUCH hotter
<Darf14> Hi RAWRity
<ponyfromPR> hew RAwRity
<CriticKitten> ....as opposed to a usual amount of Federation ships?
<ponibas> did you want a zippo?
<Spriggals> Space balls
<Dken2021> lali-ho RAWRity
<Reikim> I could have gotten it done in a week. Nope, have to delay for three months because I don't even feel like it.
<Conyst> hello RAWRity
<ponyfromPR> lol
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Friendship is Witchcraft episodes for BMN pony episodes... yay!
<cachi01> hi RAWRity!!
<RainRunner> Hey RAWRity.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hope to hear some gypsy bard
<Reikim> On the plus side it worked out, but damn I wish I could've gotten it done earlier.
<hen3ry> well, space is infinite, matter is finite, so a usual amount of anything in the universe is zero per unit of volume.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yeah thinking of getting one with a custom engraving
<RAWRity> I'm watching the olympics atm. The Women's Gymnastic team is doing their Floor exercises. One of them just did her routine to Catgroove.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Man, I just realized that the Jedi Star Fighter you find buried in the sand on Star Wars: Rebel Strike is actually Obi Wans :O
<Ryunosuke> Uncle Owen
<RosePetal> Tiny house.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Like a bossette.
<Ryunosuke> C3po
<RosePetal> Hello C3PO!
<twilight_sprinkle> hen3ry: imo space isnt infinite tho
<cachi01> hen3ry: oooooooh............ wut?
<Dken2021> RAWRity lol
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> The US Woman's Gymanstics Team wins GOLD!!!!!!
<Sumica> 00,10bet they have pony ones wrek
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I'm pretty much the only pony that doesn't like friendship is witchcraft
<RosePetal> Master ANi.
<ponyfromPR> MAKAh
<CriticKitten> Your plating looks like shit, 3PO
<Dark92Enigma> OHAI C3PO!!!!!!!!
<Meanwhile> Alpha-Omega-Prime: You aren't.
<RAWRity> Not even kidding, it's seriously Catgroove.
<Discord> His voice sounds.... familiar...
<ponibas> if u can get the engraving donw there, i'll buy you a zippo and send it.. or you can let me know what you want engraved
<RosePetal> He reconized Padme.
<Darf14> This is the droid that were looking for
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica I've seen one around the internet
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, I hope I can find it somewhere on the internet.
<Tovler> lolympics
<CriticKitten> ....wait.
<cachi01> C3PO Bender edition
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: I'm sure you can.
<CriticKitten> WAIT
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Thank goodness someone else who doesn't
<XylemTube> oh boy, it's uncle owen
<RosePetal> I actually saw the guy who voiced C3PO at the stars wars orchestra.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: what?
<hen3ry> cachi01: Hitchhiker's Guide reference.
<cachi01> uncle owen FTW
<RosePetal> Much to Talk about.
<Fou_Lou> oh i see.
<CriticKitten> 3PO showed no indication of knowing who the fuck Owen and Beru were in Episode 4.
<Saturn> 08,01i have a massive craving for pizza right now
<twilight_sprinkle> has a newsletter been sent out?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Rawrity, US team wins gold... twitchy twitchy
<CriticKitten> But he lived on their farm for YEARS?
<cachi01> hen3ry: oh its been a long time since i saw that movie in netflix lol
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> make one
<RosePetal> They wiped his memory out, remember?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: his mind was wiped
<XylemTube> CriticKitten eeeeyup
<Lunar_Brony> Saturn dammit, now I want pizza except I'm broke
<Dken2021> CriticKitten continuity error?
<SirGanjalf> Dammit, now i want a pizza too
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: In ep 3 at the end, they make a quick line of saying they're gonna wipe his memory
<hen3ry> CriticKitten: his hard drive was reformatted. He had Windows Vista installed at one point
<twilight_sprinkle> Dken2021: his mind was wiped
<Ryunosuke> Fact: Tusken Raiders is the name of the sandpeople after they raided Fort Tusken
<Darf14> still hard to believe that Vader made him
<hen3ry> cachi01: dunno if it's in the movie, it's from the book tho.
<Lunar_Brony> SirGanjalf our minds think alike
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: funfact though: No mention of wiping R2's memory!
<cachi01> hen3ry: oh i havent read the book lol
<Spriggals> Inb4 corn on the cob
<ponyfromPR> they didmt wipe it.
<Tovler> R2 kept his memories.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> No....
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> b/c R2D2 is not a loudmouthed idiot
<cachi01> your mother is dead
<Darf14> hello plot hole
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I feel it....
*Dark92Enigma My son.....remember when i told you i would be a little dead the next time you would see me? THIS IS HAPPENING NOW........:'(
<cachi01> your father is dead
<RosePetal> I think they quickly mentioned about wiping the droids memories in episode 3.
<cachi01> your family is dead
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ....so...much ...bucks not given
<cachi01> your dog is dead
<Meanwhile> His parents are deeeeeeaaaaaad.
<cachi01> you are dead
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: they didnt. apparently astrodroids memory about such things is negligible
<cachi01> GAME OVER
<RosePetal> Your goldfish is dead.
<Darf14> your cat is dead
<Sumica> 00,10how is it in this dan and age a pizza guy cant find a place
<Meanwhile> Wombo combo
<Dken2021> more angst is a-coming
<spartan133t> OHH GOD!!
<ponyfromPR> NOOO FISHY
<RainRunner> Anakin is a little to wussy for me personally to relate to. Anyone else?
<Tovler> "I watched as your mother died" ~R2 in Episode 4.
<RosePetal> Anakin i love you...
<spartan133t> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: But that doesn't explain it away because he clearly has memories of events that happened pre-wipe. ._.
<Lunar_Brony> Darf14 *insert plot-joke-associated wisecrack*
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh gosh...
<Discord> Sumica, I dunno.
<spartan133t> WHY THE KISSING!?
<hen3ry> yup. Sandpeople killed his mom... and Saddam got captured by the Americans a few years ago. Both parents therefore are ded.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: such as?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: like what?
<CrimsonPhoenix> neighsayers Rina-Chan
<CriticKitten> On the other hand I'm investing too much thought into this movie.
<RosePetal> Because we needed more love scenes.
<Sumica> 00,10it's just like posraceing
<XylemTube> Spoiler alert: Pademe's new boyfreind is psycho
<Dken2021> more duel of the fatesZ!
<RainRunner> Dat music.
<RosePetal> Duel Of Fates.

<Darf14> yay Jawas
<Dken2021> corn on... the cob!
<RosePetal> Then it just stopped.
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: sounds nasty
<SirGanjalf> The prequels need more Maul
<RosePetal> Seems legit.
<Discord> Sumica what is playing next?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Man, Geonosis always gaves me the creeps...

<PinkiePieYoshi64> yay xD
<twilight_sprinkle> cool architecture
<Sumica> 00,10not a clue
<RainRunner> yay!
<RosePetal> Suddenly aliens showup.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I seem to recall him mentioning memories of individuals as far back as the Clone Wars in Ep 4, though perhaps I'm mixing him and R2.
<hen3ry> Damn Scientologists building their temples everywhere...
<cachi01> xd
<RainRunner> lol
<RosePetal> Factories.
<Ryunosuke> all the robots!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05no no theyre unitologists

<Alpha-Omega-Prime> That Dead Space refernce
<Garretbrony> Dracula! its Dracula
<Meanwhile> Christopher Lee is best pony.
<CriticKitten> Uh.
<Discord> Sumica, oh ok
<CriticKitten> Obi-Wan?
<RosePetal> It's the man with the golden gun.
<CriticKitten> Dooku was a Jedi remember?
<XylemTube> Dooko confirmed for worst villian
<CriticKitten> He knows you're there.
<Garretbrony> Meanwhile Wicker man

<Squallken> god i hate that Viceroy guy
<cachi01> dooku coonfirmed for stupid douche
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: force masking
<Discord> WHATS HIS NAME
<Dken2021> Jinzo?
<RosePetal> I thought the villain from Pound Puppies was worst villian.
<RainRunner> Count Dooku? Count D. Count Dracula.
<hen3ry> useless army, if the leader is any indication
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dang these ads
<Dken2021> Meanwhile at the legion of doom
<Tovler> Jinzo #7 to be exact
<Discord> What is the green guys name?
<StormFox> you know that WOULD be really cool if Christopher Lee was in a mlp for a moment :3
<RosePetal> Count Doouchie.
<Meanwhile> Dken2021: I hate being here. :I
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Only works if the individual in question is more powerful, remember? Dooku is significantly stronger than Obi-Wan.
<Sumica> 00,10PinkiePieYoshi64, get adblock+
<RosePetal> But Christopher Lee is awesome.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Count Dookie! *rolls in dookie*

<cachi01> Alpha-Omega-Prime: just because its all snowy doesnt mean its lost planet
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: who said so? if anything it would make sense that its harder to notice someone with a weak/weaker power
<RainRunner> yay
<RosePetal> Nobody hears it.
<RainRunner> Aw.
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: Whats the problem with dooku being a jedi? you can leave the order,
<Lunar_Brony> Discord Green Guy with the Radio Voice Thing
<Darf14> not suspicious at al

<cachi01> ded
<RainRunner> RustyMeat. Indeed.

<Wrek|Observiking> 05adblock+
<Lunar_Brony> Discord I dunno
<Meanwhile> Darf14: They tied her to some sticks. Not quite the same.

<Discord> RUN!
<RainRunner> Run! Fucking Run!
<CriticKitten> Fou_Lou: I know, I'm pointing out that there's no way Dooku can't know he's there when he's way stronger than Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan couldn't hide his presence from someone at that level.
<Darf14> quick, give her some food
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> That has nothing to do with it. They are on a Planet were the Necromorphs originated and you fight in a 3rd person way as well as Giant Necromorphs nearly lost planet size

<Dken2021> evening red_ony
<RAWRity> Fou_Lou: why should Dooku care if one of the Jedi Order has infiltrated his secret base and is going to reveal his secret plans?
<RosePetal> You don't say

<SirGanjalf> fear... anger... buffer...
<Discord> DOES ANYONE KNOW THE NAME OF THE GREEN GUY WITH COUNT DUKU WHO HAD THE RADIO VOICE THING?
<Dark92Enigma> Anakin was all like: ''MY MOM........ded...........my mom........ded.........now i get it, THIS REALLY SUCKS! I'M GONNA KILL SOMEPONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!''
<RosePetal> No.
<Fou_Lou> RAWRity: revealing the plans would probably end in a war. their goal.
<Kandarihu> Lunar_Brony,
<Dken2021> Discord no idea
<Lunar_Brony> Kandarihu what?
<twilight_sprinkle> Discord: google is an amazing thing
<Kandarihu> Freakin' heck. I meant to clear that, not send it.
<RosePetal> I feel like this is a trap.
<Discord> I've got a bad feeling about this.
<Garretbrony> Why didnt it ever occur to Obi wan or Anakin to ever call upon the Sea Ponies Kandarihu
<Lunar_Brony> Kandarihu oh
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S A TRAP
<RosePetal> It's a trap!
<Lunar_Brony> plb plb plb plb plb pbl
<RAWRity> Fou_Lou: There's a difference between starting a war with your enemy unaware of your army and power, and starting it with them forewarned and with time to prepare.
<cachi01> A TRAP IT IS
<RainRunner> He has been emotionally comprimised.
<Kandarihu> Garretbrony, wrong series. Sea Ponies are not canon in Star Wars
<RosePetal> Ani is mad.
<twilight_sprinkle> hey guys, i brought us a corpse!
<Meanwhile> Anakin was busy murdering masses of Tuskan.
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: So far as we know. D:
<Garretbrony> Well I am going now by Kandarihu
<SirGanjalf> "I brought you a package!"
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: goodie! i got a fire started

<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Sea ponies might have made this story better.
<hen3ry> I just killed hundreds of sand people. Padme, I am so hot for you right nao... oh wait, they cut that from the script
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I dunno, they might show up in that Animated Series for all we know.
<SirGanjalf> bye Garretbrony
<Squallken> Super Bad Acting coming
<Fou_Lou> RAWRity: but the war is only a tool to get the senator to its power. Dooku and the senator are on the same side.
<AttacktheAndalite> Bye Garretbrony
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: corpses taste good
<Dark92Enigma> NO
<cachi01> yo i brought your wife she just have a problem SHE IS DED
<Dken2021> seeya Garretbrony
<red_ony> ANGRY
<RosePetal> Never mentions his mother again.
<Spriggals> Im good at fixing things
<RainRunner> Seya Garret
<SirGanjalf> SAD
<Bronysith> SirGanjalf: i wouldnt say bad acting. he did fine with the shit lines given to him
<Conyst> Drink your blue milk Annie.
<Darf14> Glowing Hexagons... what do they mean? o_0
<red_ony> SAD
<CriticKitten> You couldn't what? Act?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: how do you know that Oo
<Meanwhile> Because you never visited.
<Tovler> Gungans kinda look like horses, so I disagree with the seapony hypothesis.
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01 :D
<hen3ry> good at fixing things. Never COULD get that respirator to work right.
<Lunar_Brony> Because life is a bitch
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: cannibalism perk in fallout
<RosePetal> Because you were too late.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> You were too late, Anikan...
<CriticKitten> "Why can't I violate the laws of nature?"
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: lol k
<Dark92Enigma> BECAUSE YOU WERE A TERRIBLE SON
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why did I have to kill an entire race?!
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<CriticKitten> Nope.
<RainRunner> I find this is a very chewed scene.
<cachi01> BELEAVE IT
<RosePetal> Also because you cannot violate laws of life.
<owloysius> well, i should be
<Ryunosuke> arrogance setting in
<CriticKitten> Nope. :D
<PinkiePieYoshi64> YOU NEVER CAME FOR HER!!!! You should have came a MONTH Sooner!
<cachi01> ANAKIN WILL BE HOKAGE BELEAVE IT
<Dken2021> idd he say that sand line at one point?
<Dark92Enigma> BELIEVE IT!!!-----Naruto
<CriticKitten> HOW IS IT OBI-WAN'S FAULT?
<StrayPony> ohhh, character development!
<Squallken> omg i hate this actor
<SirGanjalf> "Ugh... I'm SO angry right now i could scream"
<Dken2021> *did
<RosePetal> Stop blaming Obi Wan for this.
<XylemTube> such shit acting should be punished by incenaration
<cratorkid> weak throw
<CriticKitten> You are made of stupid.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Pain... anger... aggression...
<Dken2021> so much angst!
<cachi01> GENOCIDE!
<hen3ry> actually you missed a few, Annie.
<XylemTube> if i were pedeme i would run
<RainRunner> Whats that sandvich?
<Dark92Enigma> OH!, NOW IT'S HIS FAULT????? BLOW ME!
<Squallken> bad acting
<RosePetal> How did Obi Wan be jealous of Anakins wife? They never even ment.
<Tovler> he's walken-ing
<cachi01> AND THE CHILDREN?
<CriticKitten> It's Obi-Wan's fault I murdered an entire group of intelligent creatures!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: And of course, this is the point where he started becoming Vader. That's right. One of fiction's most awesome villains turns evil because he can't do something that is physically impossible.
<Darf14> IM ACTING!
<RosePetal> Even the younglings.
<Spriggals> Wait he killed the women?!
<StormFox> someone needs to smack that kid upside his vanilla ice's haircut
<GabeMoist> My Sand People are DEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
<Dark92Enigma> AND THE ACTING
<red_ony> best script ever
<Tovler> :((((((
<cachi01> noooooooooooooo
<twilight_sprinkle> those are some really nice teeth
<Ryunosuke> hate... leads to the dark side
<RosePetal> Everyone DEAAAADDDDDDD!
<Dark92Enigma> AND THE SAND PEOPLE
<Meanwhile> Careful Anakin your emotions are showing. For once.
<Lunar_Brony> ALL the acting!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :'( :'( :'( :'( :'( :D I mean... :O
<hen3ry> Padme is so turned on by genocide.
<AttacktheAndalite> Lunar_Brony: ALL the acting?
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: "emotions"
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: That's not as big of a betrayal as the one coming up.
<RosePetal> I'm AcTINg!
<Tovler> "to be angry is to be human"...
<XylemTube> padme should run
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: But emotion is forbidden.
<StinkomanFan> Subtlety? What's that?
<RosePetal> Padme you should run away.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Plank from Ed Edd and Eddy had more character.
<cachi01> ^
<RosePetal> So be bland as possible.
<cratorkid> ^^
<StrayPony> Gosh pame, ever think of telling anyone about this massacre?
<hen3ry> Plank was a great character.
<red_ony> these are some nice stones
<Reikim> Hm
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: oh I know, but still.
<RosePetal> This Plank is best character.
<StinkomanFan> PLANK IS BEST PONY
<cachi01> plank FTW
<Fou_Lou> RAWRity: still anni could have decided to spare the innocent sandraider thingys
<hen3ry> dat hoverwheelchair.
<CriticKitten> Goodbye to you too, random husband we'll never see again.
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: one does not simply show emotion
<cachi01> plank is best plank
<Tovler> Stump from Angry Beavers > Plank
<red_ony> :O I wanr a hover chair!! :O
<XylemTube> Meanwhile: unlike aniken Plank had actual character development
<RosePetal> We never see this Gravestone ever again.
<Kandarihu> Anger is a natural part of the human condition. But it's important to cope with anger responsibly.
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: I can act better than he can.
<Reikim> Are we still making fun of the second prequel movie?
<Sumica> 00,10you suck manikin skywalker
<Thrackerzod> ded
<Lunar_Brony> red_ony but then you'll end up like the people in Wall-E
<RosePetal> I mean it does not show up in the old movies.
<CriticKitten> I wasn't strong enough to violate the laws of nature.
<Spriggals> That was bad sumi
<Thrackerzod> hello everyone :3
<cachi01> DAFUQ ANAKIN YOU JUST STAYED THERE TO TALK TO HER
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile, I didn't know you were an actor :3
<hen3ry> You will fail again. Because you are made of fail.
<owloysius> how should i save your mom?
<Lunar_Brony> Reikim we will never stop
<red_ony> Lunar_Brony: Fine by me :P
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: I'm not, that's my point. :P
<Discord> wa?s that bender in the background
<Dark92Enigma> I wasn't strong enough ..............to ACT
<cachi01> ^
<Dken2021> hai Thrackerzod
<RAWRity> Oh hey, Swimming's up now. Let's see if Phelps and Lochte can stop fucking it up long enough to get a damn medal.
<CriticKitten> He's trying SO hard to act.
<Sumica> 00,10if only his mom had the highground
<RosePetal> I miss you mother. Well off to be Darth Vader.
<SirGanjalf> http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/meh.ro6341.jpg - *Annie
<twilight_sprinkle> r2 heard there was a party
<Kandarihu> XylemTube, you don't notice character development here? If Anakin doesn't have character development, then this movie doesn't have action either.
<Ryunosuke> wait
<Meanwhile> I wasn't strong enough to move my face in a way that looks like I care about what I'm doing.
<Ryunosuke> wait
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: :P It'd still be awesome to hear you act :3
<hen3ry> call-forward.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Annie!!! :D :D :D :D

<CriticKitten> MESA ALL SPARKLY GLOWY
*Kandarihu realizes that he just declared war on the entire channel.
<AttacktheAndalite> Where was Gondor when Anakin didn't show any emotions

<XylemTube> Overpowered Shield Droids
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S A TRAP
<RosePetal> Droidekas@ He's doomed.
<RAWRity> I can't wait for tomorrow: "From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!"
<Conyst> They also have the peace moon plans.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> wow, adblock actually works xD
<AttacktheAndalite> You now what sucks?
<CriticKitten> ....YA THINK?

<RosePetal> Follow your orders.
<Thrackerzod> lol
<CriticKitten> It's only one parsec away!
<AttacktheAndalite> Getting popcorn kernals stuck in your teeth.
<RosePetal> No, Listen to Mace Windu.
<CriticKitten> Let's keep ignoring what a parsec is!
<Sumica> 00,10less then a parcet away? we can make that in 12 miles
<RosePetal> Stupid Padme.
<RAWRity> So if Anikin hadn't decided to go hunting Sand people, Obi-wan would have died! :D
<GabeMoist> Only take about 3 years
<Tovler> Oh hoooo pretty sneaky sis
<hen3ry> It's just like the Kessel Run.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> So SHE WAS INVOLVED IN ANIKANS DECEIT!!!
<Ryunosuke> dont worry c3po... you'll hate it
<Thrackerzod> Shizuka can you show this movie again but without the filler, IE the credits
<Lunar_Brony> RosePetal smart, yet stupid
<RosePetal> U mad Mace Windu?
<Darf14> so far hes the cartoon Link and shes the cartoon Zelda
<Meanwhile> Who is that...

<Sumica> 00,10if only we had some one dumb to sugest this moronic plan to the councle
<Dken2021> man, jarjar's been silet throughout this movie
<Kandarihu> You know, I generally don't mind most of the CGI in this movie. But that ship is so constantly out of sync with Tatooine, it's outright garish.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> How can they NOT sense the Dark Side within Palpatine? :O
<XylemTube> PALPATINE'S BEHIND IT ALL
<hen3ry> Who's the biggest idiot in the Senate? Oh, hai Jarjar

<Kandarihu> Discord, this is my first time watching the prequels.
<RosePetal> Christopher Lee.
<Fou_Lou> PinkiePieYoshi64: hes hiding his dark side. and since hes pretty strong he can do it good
<RosePetal> Why don't you just kill him?
<Thrackerzod> Shizuka couldnt be worse than verizon
<cratorkid> twilight_sprinkle: no... THID IS SPARTA
<CriticKitten> You cannot hope to contend with the will of Saruman, Obi-Wan.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05dooku is the good guy here
<twilight_sprinkle> cratorkid: dont kick me D:
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek|Observiking he is?
<Discord> COUNCELER PALPITINE IS THE EMPOROR

<RAWRity> Shizuka: I think at this point we need to just assume "Derped" is Comcast's natural state.
<Discord> SPOILER ALERT
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Wow... DOOKU IS INNOCENT!?!?
<Discord> Too late?
<Sumica> 00,10shame shame, no spoilers
<Conyst> The peace moon is really a weapon.
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek|Observiking: he was probably lying to use Obiwan to either get power for himself or turn him to the dark side
<Darf14> no spoil please

<RainRunner> My brain is melting!
<Ryunosuke> uh oh

<Spriggals> Ass faces
<SirGanjalf> Oh, democracy... What hat thou become
<StinkomanFan> BOOO
<red_ony> squid face
<Shooeie> Jar Jar started this war I swear.
<CriticKitten> B....b.....BEEEEEEETRAYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL.
<Tovler> Yes, Of course. I trust him
<Tao> SORRY, I JUST CAME FROM #CAPSLOCK
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, agreed.
<cachi01> JAR JAR YOU FUCKING DUMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS
<Dark92Enigma> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> They all agreed to Jar Jar.... DA BUCK?
<RosePetal> Because of Jar Jar!
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Sumica> 00,10and jar jar began a war that lasted 20 years
<RAWRity> What Dooku doesn't know is that eventually there will be a 3D animated series that will make him look like the shittiest Sith since Asaji Vedris
<Darf14> Dam you Jar Jar! You Caused the Deathstar! :O
<SirGanjalf> ^
<CriticKitten> THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS FUCKED OVER BECAUSE OF FUCKING JAR JAR?!?
<RainBowJack> Jar Jar is like a Selarian
<AttacktheAndalite> Dammit Jar Jar!
<Fou_Lou> isnt dooku sidious apprentice in the clonewars?
<RosePetal> Yes!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Jar-Jar you idiot
<owloysius> the republic is sexy
<XylemTube> eeeeyup
<ponyfromPR> OHHHAHAHAAH
<hen3ry> no need for a vote.
<CriticKitten> BE-TRYAL.
<Tao> DO YOU NEED A FUcKING TERMINOUS-BOT OR NOT?!
<Reikim> Jar-Jar started the war? I don't remember this?
<RosePetal> Now we are DOOMED!
<CriticKitten> BETRAYED ME. :|
<SirGanjalf> And that's why Jar Jar is the worst SW character
<cratorkid> RainBowJack: absolutely worthless
<cachi01> JAR JAR YOU DOUCHE
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Fou_Lou: but dooku doesnt know that they are [spoiler]
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Jar Jar single-handedly began the downfall of the republic.
<RosePetal> That's why nobody likes Jar Jar.
<Darf14> well..... better start joining the rebel force
<ponyfromPR> lololol:D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: who saw that coming?
<Tovler> Hey, it's the yellow floating robot from Flubber.
<RainBowJack> cratorkid : you agree with me?
<owloysius> jar jar sucks
<Reikim> God dammit, Jar-Jar. Even when the writers make you competent, you fuck up.
<Spriggals> wow
<Discord> STUPID JAR JAR
<Conyst> Say hi to Lama Su
<Fou_Lou> Wrek|Observiking: what?
<GabeMoist> "The ability to speak does not make you intelligent"
<Sumica> 00,10why the rant Tao?
<cratorkid> RainBowJack: absolutly
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat cruiser...
<CriticKitten> Jar Jar Binks destroyed the Republic. My loathing cannot seethe out fast enough.
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Not sure if Ran Tao...
<RainBowJack> Jar Jar is new face of the Selarians
<StormFox> Do you all know that in the lastest star war books that Darth Vader KILLS Jar Jar XD
<cachi01> JAR JAR IS FUCKING GEORGE BUSH
<CriticKitten> That makes me so mad.
<hen3ry> I think that was written in to satisfy the Jar Jar haters, ironically...
<Kandarihu> From all of the toy ads and what little I saw of the animated series, I thought the Seperatists were villains in some way.
<RosePetal> And he killed the Jedis.
<ponyfromPR> :O
<RainBowJack> C3PO and R2D2 are the new GETH
<RosePetal> Well not really but kinda is responsible for order 66.
<Reikim> Kandarihu: They are, kind of. They're mostly being manipulated by [spoiler], though.
<Tao> There, caps lock off
<Tao> I guess
<SirGanjalf> StormFox: And that's another reason why Vader >>> Anakin
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Everyone's a villain in this movie.
<Discord> Sumica you should stream more, your streams are teh best :D
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Vader kills Jar Jar? THHHHHAANKKKK YOOUUUUUUUUU ANIIIIEEEE!!
<RustyMeat> C3po is the best actor in the movie
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Which is part of the reason it's somewhat stupid.
<StormFox> from what i heard yeah
<Kandarihu> Ah, okay.
<RainRunner> I'm Anakin Skywalker, and this is my favorite base on Geonosis.
<hen3ry> C3PO. Programmed to understand humans.
<RosePetal> R2 does not care.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Jar-Jar isn't a villain! I'm using the insanity plea here.
<SirGanjalf> EEDIOT
<StormFox> Jar jar was leading a revolt just before the New Hope movie. Darth comes in to deal with it :3
<Darf14> R2 doesnt give a buck
<hen3ry> Jar Jar was a patshy
<hen3ry> patsy.. grr.
<Meanwhile> Commander Shepard would've fixed this by now. But we would've hated the ending.
<Spriggals> wall people
<Dark92Enigma> DARTH VADER..........KILLS JAR JAR? THANK YOU, VADER, THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!
<Tovler> I can't sense moving walls
<RosePetal> I got a bad feeling about this.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Jar Jar destroyed the Republic. HE'S A BAD GUY AND HE SHOULD FEEL BAD.
<cachi01> the lego parody with han solo as a kid is better than the actual movie
<Sumica> 00,10hen3ry, programed by a 12yr old

<CriticKitten> Fun fact: There's a Robot Chicken sketch in which Darth Vader kills Jar Jar Binks. It's probably my favorite sketch of theirs.
<Tovler> I alway die at this part
<Reikim> CriticKitten: So, instead of being a bad guy, HE'S A STUPID IDIOT AND HE SHOULD BE STUPID.
<RosePetal> Jump off the convey line.
<Tao> Do you?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I just had a sudden memory when I used to play Lego Star Wars... Geonosis was a BIIIT---.... Why did my most trusted friend scratch my game? :|

<Darf14> Press X to not die
<Tovler> You can see her life flashing before her eyes. such good acting
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix the thing saberspark does?
<RosePetal> When did factories become so violent?

<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: Watching Hulk Hogan, Mr T and Bruce Campbell filling their taxes is more entertaining than this
<RosePetal> Spider Crab.
<Meanwhile> Welp

<CriticKitten> Okay random question, why exactly are they executing their enemies like this?

<CriticKitten> Hey imagine that, when you give your captives opportunities to escape, THEY FUCKING ESCAPE. If any of you are aspiring villains, dear bronies, learn the lesson of this film and just SHOOT your enemies.
<Tovler> He's got a bad feeling about this too
<Dark92Enigma> And there was much rejoicing..................Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

<RAWRity> Funfact: I can recite all the Harry Potter chapter titles, from beginning to end, by memory. That has nothing to do with this, but it's still more entertaining to read this post than to be watching this fight scene.
<Tovler> Why doesn't Viceroy Gunray have a ray gun?
<RosePetal> Mace Windu. AH YEAH!
<Meanwhile> Master Windu is not in the mood for you.

<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek|Observiking: finally, thank you.
<Dken2021> you're bluffing, nobody has that footage
<[SWAG]Haku> Jedi are not soldiers, they are peace keepers
<RosePetal> Boba Fett lived HE LIVED!
<Tovler> until they get erased from the Jedi archives
<SirGanjalf> Wrek: Do it.
<Conyst> A stalemate! We'll see who blinks first.
<RAWRity> Wrek|Observiking: PLEASE do that. PLEASE.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> My gosh, the Jedi's are HORRIBLE!!!!
<cachi01> dat voice
<Meanwhile> If the jedi all threw their sabres outwards from that circle they'd probably get most of them...
<RosePetal> They doomed!
<Lunar_Brony> You. Will. DIE.
<RosePetal> HOORAY!
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Or a force push
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Yoda came to save the day

<cachi01> hi XAX!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Speak in a logical sentence Yoda!
<Meanwhile> Allo XAX

<Darf14> send in the clones
<Quick_Thinker> hi XAX
<AttacktheAndalite> Evening, XAX
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: Talk properly he cannot.
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: in pure front strength, yes
<Dark92Enigma> SEND IN THE CLONES!!!!!!!!!!!!
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: what to do you shall not tell me!

<XylemTube> Nittany_Discord: give him credit. he's a green alien from a distant galaxy...and can speak english
<Ryunosuke> they... left them
<CriticKitten> Gunships are best choppas
<Quick_Thinker> okay to be honest that shiip does look cool
<XAX> Good ol' star wars episode 2 >_
<XAX> >
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Boba :'(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> >: (
<RosePetal> Alas poor Jango I knew him well.
<Shizuka> 13or predicate shall i put before subject
<Lunar_Brony> Yoda-fy puns we will.
<Darf14> poor Boba :(
<Sumica> 00,10still say we should have seen his head drop out of the helmet
<Quick_Thinker> sorry boba dont feel bad you can just clone one
<Shizuka> 13and gibberish will i spout
<Tovler> Jedi are no match for droidekas but clones are?
<twilight_sprinkle> its too bad is head didnt fall out, that wouldve been funny
<CriticKitten> Jango Fett: Pointless fan service, he was.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05we did sumica
<Meanwhile> Beating the bush are we.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05for a split second as it was cut off
<owloysius> Shizuka: do that you shall
<Sumica> 00,10no when the kid lifted it
<JESmith71> Much like Boba Fett
<Shizuka> 13annoying it very is, off it pisses me
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<RosePetal> We gotta destroy it.
<Jmo4267> >_>
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Suddenly an Invasion
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica that would prove slightly humourus
*Nittany_Discord 11,01Shizuka hugs
<Bronysith> confusing way Shizuka talks in
<CriticKitten> Shizu: lol
<Quick_Thinker> how did these ships make it through without anyone noticing
<Quick_Thinker> HOW
<Bronysith> Quick_Thinker: retard lucas
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Quick_Thinker: Bad Writers
<Lunar_Brony> Quick_Thinker 'cause Star Wars
<RosePetal> Illogical Dokus plan is to me.
<Sumica> 00,10oh the lack of humanity
<cachi01> jar jar of bitch a son he is
<[SWAG]Haku> Geonosia has a terrible space defense
<RAWRity> You know, Yoda's speech made sense in Empire, because it was clear the dude was senile and borderline insane. Here, it's just silly.
<twilight_sprinkle> the death star in the background
<CriticKitten> >there are too many
*XAX Nittany_Discord dusts
<Meanwhile> Oh the huge manatee.
<CriticKitten> >this war lasts for YEARS
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH
<Darf14> look prototype AT-AT's
<CrimsonPhoenix> MY
<CrimsonPhoenix> GOD
<Tovler> why is Windu yelling?
<RosePetal> Windu can yell if he wants to.
<[SWAG]Haku> Because of the wind resistance
<Meanwhile> Point in a random direction.
<Reikim> RAWRity: He's probably been senile and borderline insane for centuries. Nearly nine hundred, he is.
<RustyMeat> because hes samuel L
<twilight_sprinkle> Tovler: cause hes had it with these mother**** driods
<RustyMeat> he yells
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the clone army and stormtroopers are teh same
<Spriggals> Republic commando was best
<CrimsonPhoenix> I WANT TO POST A VIDEO
<CrimsonPhoenix> HARD
<red_ony> has yoda nailed his feet to that transporter?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tovler: He's Samuel L. Jackson!
<Bronysith> Wrek|Observiking: thats when i lost faith in star wars
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: and it's also excessive. He only used it occasionally in his dialogue in Empire and Return. In every fucking sentence, in here it is
<RosePetal> QUICKLY!
<Lunar_Brony> dat zoom
<Quick_Thinker> these clones have better aim then the stormtroopers man what happened to them
<[SWAG]Haku> Mace Windu, Summon the Avengers!
<Reikim> Wrek|Observiking: Stormtroopers are supposedly descended (in terms of aesthetics) from clone troopers.
<RosePetal> Captain Cody.
<Fou_Lou> Wrek|Observiking: but it seems they lost their aim in the years
<cachi01> Quick_Thinker: clones of clones
<red_ony> more implausible war machines! more!
<Meanwhile> Quick_Thinker: Budget.
<Sumica> 00,10they never had aim
<Lunar_Brony> Quick_Thinker training program got dropped
<RosePetal> Send in the droids.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: and the only good about said war is that we got Genddy tartakovsky to do show it to us.
<spartan133t> fireworks!
<RosePetal> Fire all the things!
<CriticKitten> Okay, honest question
<Darf14> Purple Missle! :O
<Tovler> Mr. Garrison's wheel-thingy of death
<Lunar_Brony> hmm?
<Meanwhile> Spess.
<Sumica> 00,10they were all cloned from jengo and well you saw how well he could hit obiwan
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01ALL things we will fire.
<RosePetal> No, we keep fighting.
<Spriggals> Arn't there clone ships in space right now?
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten go on
<Quick_Thinker> how are the graphical holo projecting this do they have senors in the ground or something?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> That Foreshadowing
<Lunar_Brony> dat Death Star
<CriticKitten> The Republic gunship is CLEARLY a superior model to the Empire's shit. AND it can deploy walkers more practical than the AT-AT.
<Squallken> Death Star
<CriticKitten> So....
<RosePetal> Your doomed anyway.
<Darf14> That is no moon
<RosePetal> Foreshadow.
<CriticKitten> WHY DID THEY CHANGE TECH?
<Meanwhile> RosePetal: You're*
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: the droids probably analyze and giv e feedback
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat Death Star...
<Conyst> The plans for the peace moon
<Quick_Thinker> and fans yet again raged in anger
<Lunar_Brony> CriticKitten 'cause Star Wars
<Reikim> CriticKitten: They had to cut back the budget post-war. They had a Death Star to build, you see.
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten Change Tech?
<Tovler> Hey, it's like that thing. This automatically makes it Star Wars
<RAWRity> Seriously, in the sea of shit that is the Prequels "Star Wars: Clone Wars" was the only thing of value, because it knew when to shut the fuck up and let the action speak for itself.
<RosePetal> Never enrage the fans.
<Sumica> 00,10change it? perhaps they just never deployed it
<Lunar_Brony> RAWRity somewhat
<RosePetal> The cartoon or the tv series?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica
<CriticKitten> Reikim: They own the galaxy. Literally everything. Can't they just say "build this" and it's built? >_>
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: And it wasn't afraid to stomp on Ki-adi Mundi's head.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: rebel tech Is empire tech in part, it was said so in one of the games
<CrimsonPhoenix> I have a video I want to share after the movie
<XylemTube> ep3 is the best of the 3 prequals easy
<Squallken> oh no you dont flying ball
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: they stole empire tech
<RosePetal> Which one is Captain Cody?
<cachi01> 115?
<Quick_Thinker> THATS RIHGT TAKE ONE DOWN BUT LET THE OTHERS FLEE SMART YOU ARE NOT
<Shamroc> RosePetal: i think the yellow one..
<Discord> The orange one RosePetal
<Tovler> Yay, they got a giant ball thingy
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> That was a bit Stupid
<RustyMeat> bad idead
<RosePetal> Okay.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: It's a mechanized planet. Even a galaxy has trouble dealing with that. Also, transportation and communication issues arising from managing said galaxy.
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten They dont "own" the galaxy. The Droids are merely a diplomatic solution, like the Jedi are. Then the droid manufactures became diplomats who sided with the federalists
<PinkiePieYoshi64> xOVER9000!!!!! Kill
<RosePetal> Red and blue bullets.
<XAX> spray and pray
<Sumica> 00,10it could have been worse. they could have had 3d tech for movies when this came out.
<Darf14> dang out of ammo
<RosePetal> There is no time!
<RAWRity> >rockets
<Kandarihu> [SWAG]Haku, laser diplomacy
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: It shows. The Republic uses fighters similar to X-Wings, the Jedi use starfighters akin to the A-Wing. My question is: Republic Gunships are clearly better than the shit they were using, why bother making TIEs
<RAWRity> >YOU HAVE FUCKING LAZERS
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Dont they have lasers????/
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, can I request a video after the movie?
<XylemTube> why no lasers?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> wth
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica O_______O
<CrimsonPhoenix> PLEASE
<Reikim> "We're out of rockets. That's kind of inconvenient to us but convenient to the action choreographers."
<Darf14> Y U NO Fire lazers?!
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Eurgh. 3D. The worst thing the film industry keeps doing.
<RAWRity> WHY WOULD YOU SWITCH TO ROCKETS WHEN YOU HAVE GOD DAMN LAZERS
<Tovler> we can't get him. He's on a scootie puff sr. not jr.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Yay
<Quick_Thinker> sucks to be her
<[SWAG]Haku> Lazers could be out of amm
<[SWAG]Haku> *ammo
<RosePetal> They probably are going to make the star wars in 3d because they need money. :|
<XAX> Padame fell out? Yay.
<Quick_Thinker> actually if he did he would be fine
<Kandarihu> Could be out of... light?
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Quantity vs. Quality. Also see the TIE Fighter games.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Use lasers, dumbass.
<Lunar_Brony> XAX LoLz
<Darf14> Sorry, run out of Lazers
<RosePetal> Listen to be Obi Wan.
<Squallken> I AM ACTING
<Conyst> Again
<CriticKitten> SHOUTING MATCH
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: idk, ive thought about that before. although im not sure that its the tech, might be the people
<Reikim> Lasers are deflected by shields, rockets are not.
<Fou_Lou> [SWAG]Haku: nobody is using lasers here
<cachi01> RosePetal: here in mexico we had 4D star wars due to its anniversary
<CriticKitten> RAWR RAWR RAW
<Lunar_Brony> she would put the ship down
<Sumica> 00,10she said she would blow me when this was done I dont want to miss that goddamit obi
<Dark92Enigma> Anakin, don't let your personal feelings get in the way! WE MUST FOLLOW THE PLOT!
<RosePetal> 4d is fine.
<XylemTube> Yoda is not amused
<Tovler> Lucas said, be loud and that should be enough.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: you rang?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05haha sumi<32
<RosePetal> Follow the plot.
<cachi01> RosePetal: IT WAS AWEEEESOME
<Quick_Thinker> lasers run out in the universe HOW NO SERIOUSLY HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF AMMO IN A LASER GUN TELL ME DAMNIT
<RosePetal> Okay.
<XAX> bring me your finest ship
<Buytoast> why is kermit talking ormally now
<Dken2021> Quick_Thinker batteries?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> O_O
<Lunar_Brony> Quick_Thinker 'cause Star Wars
<Reikim> CriticKitten: In the TIE Fighter games, they establish that TIEs are not supposed to succeed. Also, TIE Interceptors/Defenders are monstrous; they're the real threat hidden among the regulars.
<CriticKitten> Nope
<RosePetal> Time to fight Count Dooku.
<Quick_Thinker> that ship was only 2 days from retirement
<Meanwhile> Stupid
<Darf14> 2 vs 1, easy wi...... *facehoof*
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> that was stupid
<Squallken> lol
<XylemTube> Stupid asshole
<RosePetal> Fool.
<Dken2021> force lightning!
<Reikim> RUN AT IT THAT ALWAYS WORKS
<RAWRity> Quick_Thinker: what kind of shitty as battery only last 10 minutes in a fire fight?
<Conyst> Force Drain
<Fou_Lou> Quick_Thinker: no laser guns are used in the fight. with exeption of the ones that cut down the big starting ships
<XAX> Reikin: >it
<Darf14> He just pulled a Leroy Jenkins
<RosePetal> Still not an epic fight like Darth Maul.
<cachi01> CHIDORI
<CriticKitten> Obi-Wan confirmed for dumbass
<[SWAG]Haku> Quick_Think It could be that theyre not really lazers, but a type of bullet that doesnt exist in our universe(yet), and we just asume that theyre lazers since we have no other cool alternative
<Bronysith> RosePetal: darth maul was not epic fight
<StormFox> and this is again why we hate the boy and love Varder :D
*Tao drags Thrackerzod in and closes the portal quickly
<Dken2021> red lightsaber, that means he's evil right?
<red_ony> I hate the fight after this...
<RosePetal> Well the music was.
<Lunar_Brony> the cool Lightsaber
<Tovler> He's more burnt than Misty's bike in episode 1 of pokemon
<Lunar_Brony> Dken2021 eeyup
<Tao> muahaha
<Reikim> [SWAG]Haku: No, they're lasers. They're just useless 'cause shield tech.
<Shamroc> Tao...dude stop with the un-needed rp..
<XylemTube> I miss Misty :(
<RosePetal> We need some epic music.
<CriticKitten> Dooku is a lightsaber duelist, you IDIOT. Why would you try to attack him head on?
<ponyfromPR> drth vader vs luke is da best
<Fou_Lou> [SWAG]Haku: Blasters. Plasma projectiles.
<cachi01> rape time!
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<Bronysith> ponyfromPR: /)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> no rape jokes
<Meanwhile> Get used to being crispy Annie...
<ponyfromPR> just chillen in the sand
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Clones are nicer than humans...
<RosePetal> I miss Misty too. Pokemon is not the same anymore.
<Bronysith> LUKE VS VADER is best lightsaber duel EVER
<Quick_Thinker> man you think anakin would have been traineed in handling lighting force attacks
<Discord> I MISS BROCK
<Reikim> Quick_Thinker: He was too busy being ANGSTY
<Discord> HE WAS THERE, ALWAYS...
<CriticKitten> Oh hey, look, choreography.
<Discord> NOW HES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE DX
<RosePetal> Come one, some music would be good.
<Conyst> No cast Summon Giant Sand Worm
<Reikim> TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH
<Bronysith> oh hey Reikim
<RosePetal> Double the swords.
<ponyfromPR> Bronysith: /)
<Dken2021> dat dual-wield
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> you know obi wan you could just help
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Yet... Anikan still fails..
<PinkiePieYoshi64> LIAF
<Kandarihu> Suddenly, Anakin can duel wield.
<Darf14> Hes not good at 2 Sabers
<Reikim> Since when is Anakin trained in dual-sabers? No seriously, it takes years of training just to not cut your arms off.
<Sumica> 00,10odd place for cable that powers lights in the wall
<RosePetal> Obi Wan is injured.
<CrimsonPhoenix> how do you know when someone retweet you in twitter?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu apparently he cant, didnt last long
<CriticKitten> And then Episode 2 became Alone in the Dark
<Tovler> Well, at least Iris caught a Dragonite. Wait, what's going on?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Twirly flashy.
<Kandarihu> Or maybe he learned to duel wield.
<Dken2021> I see anakin leveled up the ninja job class
<Bronysith> Reikim: terrible writing my dear brother
<Lunar_Brony> Reikim 'cause Star Wars
<[SWAG]Haku> It could not be training, but just instinct
<RosePetal> He can't just get up and help him.
<Quick_Thinker> trying to make it looks as good as Empires lightsaber battle they are trying at least
<Ryunosuke> MY ARM
<XylemTube> you LOSE
<RosePetal> hIS ARM!
<Reikim> TAKE HIS ARM
<Yoru_kun> disarm
<Meanwhile> Und there goes his hand
<Fou_Lou> Reikim: natural talent. because its anakin
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim he cant, he immediately lost one of the two
<Reikim> TIS BUT A FLESH WOUND
<ponyfromPR> BOOp
<RosePetal> MY ARM!
<Squallken> YODA
<Lunar_Brony> Yoru_kun dat pun

<red_ony> ....
<PinkiePieYoshi64> OH SHII
<Tovler> MY ARM! You will pay for your BARBARISM!
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Very good point.
<[SWAG]Haku> Stop, Yoda time
<StormFox> epic fail part 2
<RoboGerbil> he has been disarmed
*Dark92Enigma Oh look! A hand!
<Dken2021> here we go...
<RosePetal> Now you screwed.
<Conyst> Dooku: I disarm him
<PinkiePieYoshi64> YODA IS ON THE SCENE!!!!
<Dovah> your arms gone! no it isnt!
<XylemTube> and here is where we take a great big shit on yoda
<ponyfromPR> DDAAAYYYYUUUM MMMMMMM
<[SWAG]Haku> Looks like Annie could use... a hand
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Count Deku
<RainRunner> Mortal kombat!
<Sumica> 00,10you know slice a big hole in the spacecraft he clearly plans to get away in.
<Dark92Enigma> YODA IS HERE!
<cachi01> SLAP DOOKU WITH YOUR ARM
<CriticKitten> Bitch, don't mess with Yoda.
<RosePetal> Just fight!
<Meanwhile> Totally not in the mood for your shit, Yoda is.
<JESmith71> Now here comes epic Yoda
<Dark92Enigma> SHIT'S GONNA GO DOWN
<Reikim> Yoda, just jedi-flip over and saber him to death.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> LOL just that?
<AttacktheAndalite> DIS GON B GUD
<CriticKitten> >trying to outperform Yoda with Force powers
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica but they won't. Why? 'Cause Star Wars.
<Reikim> That was anticlimactic.
<CriticKitten> An idiot, Dooku is
<RosePetal> Bring it on!
<XAX> AttacktheAndalite: you win
<Tao> THIS CHAT IS TOO FAST! I'M OUT!
<RustyMeat> NOPE
<Reikim> HADOKEN
<StormFox> if yoda is this awesome wonder how good he would be in his young years o_O
<PinkiePieYoshi64> OH SHIIII
<RosePetal> A fool Dooku is.
<Lunar_Brony> seeya Tao
<Quick_Thinker> THIS SCENE IS A TRAITOR TO THE CHARACTER YES?
<hen3ry> None of these Jedi ever seem to learn the Conservation of Sensei-fu. You always lose to the person who taught you (or taught your teacher).
<RAWRity> "Hey Anikin, I want to show you my new girlfriend here." "But all that's over there with you is my left hand!" ";)" "6_9"
<Thrackerzod> Reikim yodas saber stlye is godlike
<ponyfromPR> lol :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> This is getting a bit stupid
<cachi01> counter
<RainRunner> Two oldest characters have the most badass fight scene while the younger ones have nothing.
<Squallken> GO YODA GO :D
<ponyfromPR> dooku u mad bro? :D
<CriticKitten> Shizuuuu. Why does everyone in this film keep gripping the idiot ball? ;-;
<XylemTube> dooku is gonna get is asswhooped by a 600 year old alien
<Reikim> YODA KILL HIM
<RosePetal> Why can't you just light saber fight.
<Sumica> 00,10and with that power yoda has at least 25 more years of life left in him.
<Meanwhile> Und dann Yoda could fight.
<Reikim> KILL HIM YODA YOU BADASS GREEN DWARF
<red_ony> don't do it yoda...aaw
<RosePetal> Now we fight!
<Thrackerzod> yoda is a god
<Wrek|Observiking> 05or i dunno, combining the two?
<Conyst> It is obvious zis contest will not be decided bah our knowledge of... Force Arm-Wrestling, but bah our skills with ze lasair sword. En garde!
<RosePetal> AW YEA!
<Darf14> To be honest the 1st time I saw Yoda fight, I LOL'd
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Now this is a good fight
<Reikim> Sumica: Imagine him in his prime. My. God.
<Shooeie> Dam he can move
<Bronysith> This scene is just so.. so. so much FUCKING FAIL
<Lunar_Brony> technically, that is also the force IIRC
<Dark92Enigma> THE BUFFER IS WEAK IN THIS ONE
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek they do
<cachi01> dat YEAAAAAAAAAAAA
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith How?
<RosePetal> Go yoda!
*AttacktheAndalite walks around the chat "Popcorn, get your popcorn here!"
<Tovler> must. contain. laughter
<Dark92Enigma> FINALLY WE HAVE AN EPIC BATTLE!
<CriticKitten> Fun fact: NO ONE took this fight sequence seriously in theaters
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Note to self... never duel with midgits...
<twilight_sprinkle> yoda with battlecries lol
<RaveBrony> Oh snap
<RosePetal> *eats popcorn*
<Dark92Enigma> In this movie*
<Meanwhile> He's very spritely for someone who apparently needs a cane.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> This is just-The Beginning
<Lunar_Brony> AttacktheAndalite I will trade you a bucket for a muffin.
<RosePetal> COWARD!
<DocSane> Save us, CGI Yoda!
<Sumica> 00,10so much for not leting fealings control you yoda
<Kandarihu> So everypony's cool with Yoda fighting?
<Discord> Pickles.... Pickles..... Get your pickles..... Family recipe pickles...
<Meanwhile> Now fling that at hs ship.
<Conyst> I'll take some popcorn. Here's three bits.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: He uses the cane to throw people off. Yoda is just that badass.
<Derpy_Hooves> night everyone
<Meanwhile> Or...drop it.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: yoda is old. the appeal of yoda is that he is powerful even though he is little and old. when you are older, you are not physically powerful
<RosePetal> Yoda is badass anyway.
<Dken2021> night Derpy_Hooves
<AttacktheAndalite> Lunar_Brony: Done. *gives a muffin*
<DocSane> Some of us always wanted to see Yoda fight.
<Tovler> using CGI saved Lucas a bundle on strings
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Derpy_Hooves
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: it wouldve been better if it was a force battle
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Or grab his ship with the Force.
<XylemTube> Kandarihu: yes and no
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Use the gunship to kill him!
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Derpy_Hooves
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Which he could totally do.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> ?
<RosePetal> Why can't you shoot him?
<Quick_Thinker> USE BOTH HANDS YOU DUMB HANDMAIDEN
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Indeed.
<Lunar_Brony> AttacktheAndalite -_(\ I give you a muffin, you give me popcorn
<Discord> Dat solar surfer
<Lunar_Brony> plz
<Reikim> Cool ship design. Too bad it never resurfaces.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the sail of that ship keeps reminding me of of that star trek TNG movie
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: or use the force to throw a bomb onto his ship.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05whats it called
<RosePetal> Yoda is sad.
<AttacktheAndalite> >MFW I cut my thumb and just notices it
<hen3ry> trollda
<RainRunner> We need the matrix revolutions. Now that is an awesome battle.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten they cant grab ships, thats why too hard.
<ponyfromPR> lol:D
<CriticKitten> Insurrection, Wrek?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ah yes
<Wrek|Observiking> 05insurrection
<Tovler> lol, now he's old and slow again
<Meanwhile> RainRunner: Shame about the rest of it.
<twilight_sprinkle> *way
<DocSane> Wrek|Observiking: Star Trek: Burning Erection?
<Dken2021> ooh, have the matrix triligies b\played yet?
<Discord> Sumica after this can you play that game again?
<Sumica> 00,10they had one of those in DS9 as well wrek
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Weirdest Ship ever
<StormFox> mind giving me a hand :D
<Reikim> RainRunner: I find it amusing and appropriate that you refer to that movie as one battle singular.
<AttacktheAndalite> Lunar_Brony: My bad *gives you a giant bucket of popcorn* Butter?
<RosePetal> That's no moon.
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith Its called adrenaline, something even old people can use to perform under better curcumstances. Second, Yoda is the best Jedi when it comes to the force, hwe can use it to help him battle like that. The force isnt just about pushing and pulling.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat Buffer....
<AttacktheAndalite> >mfw said cut is starting to get feeling.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Yoda lifted an entire X-Wing fighter in his old age in Empire. :p
<RAWRity> Sumica: implying anypony gave 2 fucks about DS9
<Discord> Is dis da one with Grievous?
<RainRunner> Meanwhile, Reikim: well the movie was just one big climax to the trilogy.
<RosePetal> No.
<Dken2021> Discord nope
<RosePetal> 3rd one is.
<Reikim> [SWAG]Haku: But that's the very definition of a force! Unless you get into the four fundamental types.
<Sumica> 00,10it was good till the war RAWRity
<Discord> aww :(
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten an immobile xwing with no speed, and he barely lifted it up
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: but he is 2 feet tall, so to compensate he has to jump everywhere, and it just looks fucking stupid
<hen3ry> DS9 wasn't that bad. It paled in comparison to Babylon 5 tho
<Lunar_Brony> AttacktheAndalite nah, I'm fine. *sticks face in popcorn*
<AttacktheAndalite> Lunar_Brony: Don't choke on that
<RAWRity> Sumica: at least it was better than Voyager
<hen3ry> Voyager is when the series jumped the shark
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Leave Voyager alone.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Barely? He lifted it easily.
<Discord> So Sumica, you think you can play that space game thing?
<Reikim> "A force isn't just about pushing or pulling." Any physics majors here?
<Sumica> 00,10Kerbal? perhaps
<RosePetal> You have done well for a coward.
<Tovler> Voyager was awesome.
<somepony_else> oh look, it's the pope
<CriticKitten> HAI EMPEROR
<ponyfromPR> yay
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i find myself saying the same about the latest star trek redux
<Discord> Sumica: YES I love kerbal :D thank you!
<RosePetal> No.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05sure the first 2 seasons were dull and played on sex every episode
<[SWAG]Haku> The Definition isnt PUSHING and PULLING. Its a natural energy that Jedi and Sith can harness. It just so happens that the two most common ways of doing so is to push and pull
<CriticKitten> Seriously dude, get another robe, you're wearing THE SAME ROBE
<Conyst> Now to the Cheddar Monks
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> YOU DONT SAY YODA
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten he gave a exhausted heavy breath after he lifted it. and it wasnt flying
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but once the xindi wars errupted i enjoyed that show
<Discord> Sumica: I mean after the movie, of course.
<RosePetal> Captain obivious.
<RosePetal> Oh no....
<Tovler> "Agree, I" you mean, Yoda
<CriticKitten> Victory?
*Dark92Enigma Victory? Victory this is not. A cloud of darkness and POINTLESS FILLER hovers on the galaxy..............we have just enntered.........in the BATTLE OF THE FILLER CLONES!
<Discord> Master pokemon?
<oni_link> Whats on everypony?
<Tovler> Victreebel
<Conyst> General Yoda's Great Big Sith Hunt! Begun, it has!
<Tovler> Victini
<Darf14> They may won the battle, but they havent won the war yet
<Sumica> 00,10drop the movie title has
<somepony_else> dun dun duuuun
<Reikim> The Clone War? He named it before it started?
<RAWRity> >Order of jedi skilled at sensing evil and darkness
<RosePetal> But luckily we can just skip this, and go to the 3rd movie.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but ut seems to be only me that thinks so
<CriticKitten> Oh hey look, Star Destroyers.
<Bronysith> dan vs Sumica
*Dark92Enigma BEGUN THE FILLER WAR HAS

<RAWRity> >Can't spot Darth Sidius RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR FACES
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys

<Dken2021> hoq is the minseries the clone wars?
<CriticKitten> Star Destroyers.
<Reikim> Best part of this movie is the John Williams soundtrack. Let's not lie to ourselves.
<RosePetal> Greedo.
<Tovler> Suddenly, General Grievous appears.
<RosePetal> Darth vader music.
<Discord> ITS NOT GREEDO
<RustyMeat> WHAT
<Darf14> Prototype Star Destroyers
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> UNWANTED SCENE
<AttacktheAndalite> Yeah, that nick is getting feeling
<RosePetal> No, they get married.
<RustyMeat> WTF
<RAWRity> Dken2021: "Star Wars: Clone Wars" is fantastic. Star Wars: The Clone Wars is poop.
<Discord> ITS A GREEDO RACED PERSON
<XAX> and then this scene
<DocSane> And he marries her, because she's not like sand
<RustyMeat> WHY
<CrimsonPhoenix> seriously JanAnimations is WAY better than BronyDanceParty
<twilight_sprinkle> and then EXPLOSION
<hen3ry> Why they have to get married? Live in sin you two!
<RosePetal> You should have just ended with the clones.
<Meanwhile> At least they didn't feel the need to drag out this marriage.
<CriticKitten> Darf14: I don't recall nor care what model, that's my point. :p

<Quick_Thinker> hm didn't lukes have a a battery in it to charge mechial tools (it was talked about in the books)
<Saturn> 08,01vibrator?
<[SWAG]Haku> I saying this now; I enjoy the prequels much more the original trilogy. Althought the OT is the more loved one, the prequels are able to give us more action and adventure since its what made the OT possible. When I first watch the OT, I always wondered what Darth VAder use to be like, how the clone wars happened, and what other JEdi were like. The prequels answered those for me, why the OT were the ones who me me ask.
<RAWRity> XAX: the 3D clone wars is poop
<Meanwhile> Dat wall of text.
<CriticKitten> Sorry guys, just threw up in my mouth a little at the idea of Hayden nude and thrusting

<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: and just like that you lost someone who doesnt care for you
<oni_link> lol
<Reikim> Saturn: We were just talking about Annie's hand. He's got some special attachments on it.
<XylemTube> Genocide/10
<RosePetal> They were talking about the hand.
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Sing in draconic with it.
<Tovler> some of the worst acting and script ever.
<Conyst> Night everypony

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cratorkid: Right.
*Kandarihu puts his hand on PinkiePieYoshi64's shoulder.
<CriticKitten> Haku: The original trilogy is a Heroic Journey archetype. The new movies are generic action flicks.
<hen3ry> Preeeeeze?
<twilight_sprinkle> 8/10. its still better and more original than most of the modern stuff and its definitely enjoyable if you havent decided to hate it
<PinkiePieYoshi64> ACROSS THE STARS BY MUTHABUCKING JOH WILLIAMS/10
<DocSane> [SWAG]Haku: These prequels were a mess, crippled by an unlikable Anakin Skywalker than no one ever really likes.
<Tovler> Frank Oz directed that awesomely bad Stepford Wives remake.
<RosePetal> Mace Windu/10
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Kanarihu; HIya, what's up? :P
<CriticKitten> Haku: So it boils down to whether you wanted story or a bunch of pewpewpewflashboomzoom crap.
<Fou_Lou> night everypony
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: that also manage to completely fuck up the continuity and characters of the originals
<Dken2021> night Fou_Lou

<Wrek|Observiking> 056am
<Ponies47> Bye Fou.....
<Wrek|Observiking> 05wow
<Wrek|Observiking> 05no rest for the wicked
<RAWRity> Star Wars was originally, in a lot of ways, A western movie set in space.
<red_ony> CGI clusterfuck/10
<oni_link> both series didnt catch my attention
<Meanwhile> Go to bed Wrek.
<Reikim> God these strings. AND THAT BRASS SECTION. If music is sex then John Williams is an orgy.
<CriticKitten> Yeah, I'm still a bit sickened by the thought of Anakin breeding
<Sumica> 00,10at least you got pizza wrek
<Wrek|Observiking> 05true
<RAWRity> The prequels were reheated pop.
*Tovler checks to see if The Stepford Wives is A or B.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and some candy
<applewings> see ya brohhof
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Kandarihu: aww, thanks mate :) /)
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek|Observiking you got pizza? Lucky . . .
<Ponies47> Wrek: CANDY!
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith Hey, dont get me wrong, I love the OT very much, theyre some of the best films Ive ever seen, but they just made me wonder about how things got the way the were. The prequels showed us how everything happened and why. True, there were some mistakes made with the prequels, some I wish werent in them, but the fact remains that the reason Darth Vader was even Darth Vader was because he was too close to his emotions, all
<AttacktheAndalite> Reikim: Don't forget Hans Zimmer
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: with Natalie Portman no less.
<Kandarihu> Too late to show mom an episode of Macross /10
<hen3ry> No. If music is sex, then John Williams is the greatest pimp ever.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05btw saturn i hope you like licorice
<Meanwhile> Ew, liquorice.
*oni_link agrees with RAWRity
<Dark92Enigma> I'M SICK OF THESE MOTHERBUCKING SOAP OPERA IN THIS MOTHERFUCKING MOVIE/10
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<DocSane> Lucas was too obsessed with making each prequel match up thematically to its corresponding original movie.
<Discord> Sumica, does it let you skip the credits?
*Ponies47 Pokes Saturn
<ponyfromPR> :D
<Reikim> AttacktheAndalite: If you could get the two together, in one soundtrack, I would probably die and then come back as a god only to die again in Ragnarok while leading the forces of good to glory.
<AttacktheAndalite> Licorice is tummy
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: who are you?
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith And there are many toher things in them that showed how the emperor rose to power, something you have to admit wouldve made you wonder if the prequels were never made
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/3ydTy.jpg /10
<Lunar_Brony> ^
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: but nothing makes sense
*oni_link pokes Ponies47
<Dark92Enigma> SIR JOHN WILLIAMS/10
*Jmo4267 pokes oni_link
*Lunar_Brony throws a muffin at oni_link
<RAWRity> Lucas is proof that some creators NEED studio executives to keep them from doing stupid shit.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I don't mind Natalie so much, she has demonstrated that she CAN be a good actor with the right script. I honestly feel sorry for her being in the prequels, because her GOOD stuff will never be remembered over Padme.
<Sumica> 00,10nope i have no way of skiping the credits at all.
<AttacktheAndalite> Reikim: Hans Zimmer and John Williams did Kung Fu panda soundtrack. Also, the two together is a massive orgy of all scales
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek|Observiking: actually, i can't stand the stuff
*Ponies47 Pokes oni_link "HI!" :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith Tell me one thing that doesnt make sense. One.
<DocSane> The Jedi come off as such easily-duped pricks in these movies.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05salmiak?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> This music is just so beautiful.... after Duel of the Fates, I think this one is my second favorite :')
<Sumica> 00,10Once i hit play it must go all the way to the end before I can do any thing
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: and her rathe forgetable role in Thor as well.
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica whatev. Music ain't bad
<Tovler> hmm… Stepford Wives had a high budget, but it have a 5.1 on imdb.
<Reikim> AttacktheAndalite: ...Did they actually do that soundtrack? I'll have to listen to that movie properly now...
*Lunar_Brony throws a muffin at Ponies47
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek|Observiking: he's my favourite to'kra
<owloysius> what? licorice is tolerable
<AttacktheAndalite> Reikim: Yep. For the first and second movie as well
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: "i dont trust these people. i think something bad could happen any minute" Drinks tea
<Kandarihu> I honestly hope that Episode III tomorrow night won't be the Rifftrax version.
<Ryunosuke> ................................
<Lunar_Brony> licorice? Blech
*Ponies47 Nomes on Lunar_Brony's muffin
<Dken2021> hey, mind if I link a vidoe now?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Yeah, she's a good actor who has gotten dealt some good and some bad hands. Hayden though? Can anyone name a film he was great in?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05oh well you can use it as prank candy then (lol SG joke) cause its burning hot
<Ponies47> *Noms
*AttacktheAndalite wants some Twizzlers now
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek|Observiking: but no, i don't liek salmiak
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: he had a bad feeling about the ship yet he willingly drank tea which couldve been poisoned
*oni_link laughs because of Jmo4267 's poke and catches Lunar_Brony 's muffin
<somepony_else> licorice? yummi
<owloysius> as long as it isn't black licorice, that's disgusting
<Saturn> 08,01i've had the german version before
<Jmo4267> ;D
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: we'll provide out own Rifftrax!
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith well what do you want, attack them for no reason while being on a diplomatic mission?
<JESmith71> Unless they run it twice. Both original and Rifftrax
<StormFox> a rifftax version of Episode 3 o_O i SO want to see that :D
<Tovler> Leon The Professional.
<Ryunosuke> so... I finally took a look at Tara Strong's twitter page
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ill see what i can find
<PinkiePieYoshi64> AAWW SHIIZ, John Williams at his best right here :P
<Ryunosuke> all that bling
<Meanwhile> Spent all the budget on CGI, couldn't train half the cast. /10
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: the fact that he willingly drank the tea, which couldve been poisoned was retarded
<Kandarihu> StormFox, have you seen Episode III already?
<JESmith71> That's what they did with the other films during the trilogy feature
<Wrek|Observiking> 05worst case i bring plopp
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith as for the tea, jedis havent been known to get poisoned iirc, they might sense it or someth
<Reikim> AttacktheAndalite: Bullshit, I looked it up, it was Hans Zimmer and John Powell, whoever that is.
<CriticKitten> I'm legit curious, too.
<oni_link> Ponies47: how ya been dude? :)
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith Just because he has a bad feeling doesnt mean he knows exactly what will come. He can not see the future, merely predict that a bad event will 'soon' come to pass
<Saturn> 08,01oh oh!
<CriticKitten> Not even trolling. Can ANYONE name a film Hayden was good in?
<Saturn> 08,01can you bring me some mesmor?
<Tovler> I stopped caring about John William's after the Harry Potter theme
<Saturn> 08,01i *love* that stuff
<Discord> OMG
<Ponies47> oni_link: I'm good. How's about you? :3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i should be able to
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: and when tehy filled the room with poison. why not just leave the door closed for like 5 hours and then they will be dead
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Reikim: JOHN POWELL, DON'T KNO?!?!? That's like the John Williams of animated movies, mate!
<Dark92Enigma> look at that <.....
<JESmith71> There's that disclaimer again
<Lunar_Brony> WHERE?
<Saturn> 08,01i've not had it in *years* since my local swede left for greener pastures
<AttacktheAndalite> Reikim: Ohhh....oh yea that's right. I knew there was a John in there somewhere.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: but noooooo " they are probably dead now, so go in there and ffinsih whats left of them"
<Meanwhile> What is this vid with such terrible contrast?
<Reikim> PinkiePieYoshi64: Excuse me as I shrug.
<AttacktheAndalite> Reikim: But John Powell is just as good as them
<hen3ry> needs captions.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith they Did leave it for a while, but the jedi meditated and held out longer than they thought

<oni_link> darn derpy keyboard :P
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith Look, no matter what you think, answer me this; Do or dont the prequels make you apprecitate the OT even more so than possible without them.
<Dark92Enigma> so Adorable
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Reikim: John Powell is known for "The Incredibles", some of "Toy Story", "Rio" "How to Train Your Dagon" (he was nominated Oscar for this), and a few numberous films that are pixar Classics
<Kandarihu> Romanian Fluttershy doesn't sound gentle.
<oni_link> Ponies47: Its still not soon enough though!
<Discord> Could cook a fooden?
<Meanwhile> Hungarian Fluttershy'd eat all those animals.
<Ponies47> oni_link: Awwww. It will come don't worry
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: what? i hate the prequels cause it has nothing to do with the OT whatsoever
<Reikim> PinkiePieYoshi64: Okay, for How To Train Your Dragon, he gets my salute.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: i dont even know what youre referring to there
<XylemTube> Dagger of danak!
<hen3ry> to be fair, the last half of the song is not in Fluttershy's normal speaking mode.
<Meanwhile> Hungary, never waste food. You will eat pig feet and you will like it.
<DocSane> I like the Dutch one
<CrimsonPhoenix> Italian~

All I said was that I enjoy them more because they answered some things I had wondered ofr years. Its my opinion saying that the prequels, though not better in story, make good movies on their own.
<hen3ry> Yoru_kun: one is spoken in Portugal, the other in Brazil
<Kandarihu> TMK, there is no official Japanese dub, only a fandub.

<AttacktheAndalite> Night [SWAG]Haku
<Kandarihu> From my understanding, the Japanese tend to have a bad reaction to quadropeds. There is only ONE mecha franchise in which the robots aren't humanoid, and the Brony fandom has a limited impact there as well.

<cachi01> yep
<Alister> I love the way he says suit
<DocSane> Reikim: To be fair, it apparently overs any instance of an animal crawling into your engine and casuing damage.
<AttacktheAndalite> CrimsonPhoenix: yep
<Darf14> nope... not MLP at all *shifts eyes*
<Reikim> Yeah, looks too smooth for Gmod
<Lunar_Brony> "I could care less about my suit."

<Reikim> Dammit that's sad
<Kandarihu> I don't know. Maybe it's because of the GMod ponies getting made.
<Shamroc> souporcat: practical problems
<Polydunami> Umm, I KNOW that. Rainbow Road is a staple of Mario Kart games.
<Polydunami> I was wondering which version.
<souporcat> oh thanls.

<cachi01> one does not simply complete the rainbow road without falling
<Meanwhile> Dat spy.

<AttacktheAndalite> Why is everyone ganging up on Red Engie?
<XylemTube> lol he ded
<Polydunami> You can actually fall off Rainbow Road in Mario Kart 64. You just have to try hard enough :P
<oni_link> cachi01: it was really fun
<Reikim> I'm laughing for real, and that never happens
<superretroworld> cachi01: its a great game, but theres a little wall of stars on the paths so you wont fall off
<DocSane> Oh, I saw Ted tonight. That movie is hilarious.

<cachi01> i wanna watch ted!
<Lunar_Brony> I like this alot
<oni_link> DocSane: agreed!
<xtremetoxicguy> BEST PART

<Lunar_Brony> Doomsday
<Lunar_Brony> oh gawd

<Meanwhile> You have fucked up now.
<cachi01> Reikim: eeyup
<Sumica> 00,10woops

<cachi01> well shit

<Zephyr> *clap
<RainRunner> ^
<Thrackerzod> nuke XD
<AttacktheAndalite> Aw, fuck
<Lunar_Brony> I blame the BLU engi
<Kandarihu> I'd honestly like to see these SFM videos that are devoid of any of Valve's assets. But I'd probably have to pay for it, since the creators can legally charge for it.
<Meanwhile> Well.
<Alister> And that is why TF2 should never have tactical nukes
<Quick_Thinker> and not a single was said in the entire video
<Zephyr> i wonder how he did the smashed up map
*Reikim claps
<Discord> Sumica will you be playin kerbal again? I kinda want to know so I can stop annoying the shit out of you >.<
<XylemTube> Yeah! Fuck 2fort!!!!!

<AttacktheAndalite> *coughs and stretches* Thanks
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Same they should
<CrimsonPhoenix> I also learn that it's more than useless to request a video.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Nittany_Discord: they can only "Ponify" the oens that have had their SFM files released
<xtremetoxicguy> Things got serious
<Reikim> Four turrets? HAAAAX

<Quick_Thinker> where did all the swords come from?
<Lunar_Brony> I can't wait until "Meet the Pyro" gets ponyfied
<Thrackerzod> epic
<Kandarihu> Well, we know that Meat the Heavy was released. So we should be seeing Fluttershy freaking out over somepony touching her gun.
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait Heavy?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd think they'd make Pinkie a Pyro.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Big Mac
<Sumica> 00,10Big Mac is the heavy most the time
<CrimsonPhoenix> I mistook
<Ponies47> I forget. Watch pony is Pyro?
<Sumica> 00,10Some times fluttershy

<otakon> well they're getting better
<Ponies47> *Which
<superretroworld> :'(
<Kandarihu> Sumica, oh. I thought it was Fluttershy.
<otakon> OH SHIT
<xtremetoxicguy> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Who's Heavy then?
<DocSane> See, a clever animator would have kept the swords in their mouths and them on four legs.
<oni_link> Nittany_Discord: pinkie for pyro!
<Reikim> Pinkie is the Pyro, Fluttershy is the Medic, Mac is the Hoovy, etc.
<Quick_Thinker> ah shit fluttershy got disarmed
<CrimsonPhoenix> BIg Mac
<xtremetoxicguy> yay
<otakon> the hell?
<cachi01> O_O
<otakon> nice Twi
<Ponies47> Fluttershy is Medic
<Lunar_Brony> nice shot
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Big Mac's the heavy.

<Quick_Thinker> good job twi saved everyone
<xtremetoxicguy> GOOD ENDING!

<Thrackerzod> the machina dosnet use bullets

<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: spy is changling
*AttacktheAndalite hasn't played TF2 since the last disaster a few months ago.
<otakon> CAVE STORY CANNOT LAG UNLESS YOUR PC IS A DECADE OLD
<cachi01> XylemTube: and there is this button in the middle that gives you turbo
<Ponies47> AttacktheAndalite: Huh?
<Reikim> Polydunami: Are you actually serious about that? Because you might need a new computer.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Like yours?
<oni_link> otakon: lmao

<Ponies47> Wrek|Observiking: Care if I join in?

<scottish-geeky> cachi01: strem is on no more youtube links
<Reikim> DashWithRainbows: http://www.mlptf2mods.com/
<cachi01> scottish-geeky: yeah sorry lol
<Meanwhile> The Original looks like a crotch rocket.
<DashWithRainbows> Suddenly, Doom: TF2 version,
<scottish-geeky> cachi01: lolz
<AJTheMightyGamer> I find this really..... (misses mosqueto) DAMN IT
<DashWithRainbows> thanks a lot Reikim.
<Kandarihu> One question about the Pony/Class affinities. If Big Mac is the Heavy, who's the Soldier and Demoman?
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Spike and Zecora.
<Lunar_Brony> I would like to see Derpy as the Demo
<Discord> How did you get your rocket launcher to be held like that?
<cachi01> soldier should be the YEAAAAAAH pony
<Kandarihu> I was guessing Celestia and Luna, but that works too.
<scottish-geeky> cachi01: u like Manowar
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm i feel left out =/
<Reikim> Sumica: Where did the Luna Sniper model come from?
<Firelight> Still buffering.
<Firelight> -.-
<Firelight> NVM
<Discord> Sumica is that how that rocket is held?
<Lunar_Brony> Discord that one's called "The Original". Basically the same stats as the Rocket Launcher, except rockets fly straight down the cursor
<xtremetoxicguy> CANT FINISH QWOP MLP!!!
<Discord> Oh...
<cachi01> xtremetoxicguy: xD
<Quick_Thinker> hm any clue what the IP is?
<Lunar_Brony> Discord there's a reson it's called the "Penis Cannon"
<cachi01> CAAAAAAAAAAAAANNOOOOOOOOON PEEEEEEEEENNIIIIIIIIIIS
<xtremetoxicguy> I FEEL RETARDED
<Lunar_Brony> Quick_Thinker wish I could tell you
<scottish-geeky> thanks CrimsonPhoenix so far i like it
<Kandarihu> Nice spray, there
<Meanwhile> The Original still looks like a crotch gun.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is this a Doom TF2 mod?
<cachi01> looks like
<Discord> Sumica can I play with you?
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: Nah it's an actual weapon.
<Kandarihu> I'd like to think of it as a chest-mounted cannon
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: no its a real weapon
<otakon> OH HELLYEAH!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: its called the Original
<AJTheMightyGamer> OOOHHH! now i know
<otakon> THE OLD REPUBLIC IS NOW FREE TO PLAY!
<Quick_Thinker> and there was Ponies47 cameo
<Meanwhile> otakon: Welcome to five hours ago.
<Discord> Wrek what's the server password?
<Alister> Password ? But I wanna play :(
<otakon> Meanwhile: why? WHY DO YOU RAIN ON MY PARADE?
<Quick_Thinker> old republi BAH im skipping that
<Meanwhile> otakon: Because I caaaan.
<xtremetoxicguy> I feel like a winner when I play qwop
<Kandarihu> Hey, what otakon was saying is news to me.
<xtremetoxicguy> but mlp qwop, i feel retarded
<otakon> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/critical-miss/9834-Our-Little-Pony
<Poly|DoctorWho> Okay, back to watching some more Doctor Who.
<scottish-geeky> nooo pinky
<Discord> Wrek can you tell me the server password?
<Meanwhile> otakon: That's from seven hours ago.
<otakon> Meanwhile: damn you
<otakon> Meanwhile: DAMN YOU AND YOUR MUSTACHE!
<Meanwhile> otakon: Mind your caps.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I beat Dead Space 2.
<scottish-geeky> Meanwhile: caps u play fallout dont u
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The Original. Is that a new weapon?
<Meanwhile> scottish-geeky: Actually I dislike Fallout. I meant capslock.
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord it's been around for over a year now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: nah its old
<otakon> AH!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've never seen it used.
<Reikim> Time to download all the TF2 pony models to compliment my Touhou pony models.
<scottish-geeky> Meanwhile: ohh oki
<otakon> Bethesda got ahold of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. apparently
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm not sure if i should join
<Jmo4267> loldeadspace2
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: It never gets used cuz it's identical to vanilla launcher.
<otakon> HELL YEAH!
<otakon> NEW BETHESDA MADE STALKER!
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord it has the same stats as the Rocket Launcher, so I'm not surprised
<scottish-geeky> dead
<Meanwhile> Attack of the ten foot axe.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So it's a vanity launcher. OK.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: yup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pony models
<Kandarihu> My own interpretation of the Pony/TF2 afinitties, I guess would have Applebloom = Demoman, Scootaloo = Soldier, and Sweetie Bell as Heavy, unless Fluttershy is the Heavy, then Sweetie Bell = Medic.
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord if you want to put it that way, then yes
<cachi01> at least this rocket launcher goeas directly ahead
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01!
<scottish-geeky> PONY
<cachi01> BTW someone cosplayed as rainbow dash scout at bronymexicon
<scottish-geeky> ha Wrek|Observiking sur dos love twilight
<Jmo4267> Did you enjoy the Dead Space 2 ending Nittany_Discord?
<Pudge> Hi everypony
<Lunar_Brony> I like to snipe with a Strange Piss Rifle
<scottish-geeky> hia Pudge
<Lunar_Brony> hi Pudge
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was satisfying.
<Meanwhile> Lunar_Brony: You're a bad sniper.
<Pudge> I bring good news
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The boss was easy.
<Pudge> I got an interview :)
<scottish-geeky> Pudge: what
<scottish-geeky> Pudge: cook
<Reikim> Wrek rollin' with the Hoovy.
<scottish-geeky> Pudge: cool
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pudge: Awesome.
<Jmo4267> Yeah it is Nittany_Discord.
<cachi01> BRB IN 10 MINUTES
<Pudge> It's at an art store, if i get the job i'm gonna be stocking shelves and run a register
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hi Pudge
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The boss was easier than the last few rooms in the game.
<Buytoast> Dead Space 2?
<Reikim> It's nice knowing that I'm not the only one who uses the "ding" on hits.
<Jmo4267> Yeah, they could of done abit more effort into the last boss, but meh whatever. Hoping they don't let down on Dead Space 3.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I use the ding.
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile no, I'm a good sniper. I target scouts (cuz I'm mostly on 2fort), stupid engies, and the rest I cripple. I also like to troll other snipers.
<Pudge> I never finished dead space 1
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge, sweet. I wish I culd get an interview.
<AJTheMightyGamer> i also use the ding
<Jmo4267> Finish it nao.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think DS3 will be a letdown.
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile hell, my friend has a Burning Snaggletooth.
<Reikim> Jmo4267: Someone on here rants about Dead Space 3 a lot. Apparently they're dropping most of the horror element in favour of multiplayer?
<Pudge> i got stuck on the monster that follows you around the ship and you cant kill it
<Jmo4267> It probably will since they're practically getting rid of the horror aspect.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's an EA game. Expect it.
<Meanwhile> Lunar_Brony: If you use a Sydney Sleeper, you're a bad sniper.
<Buytoast> Dead Space was 2spooky, so they're making it an action game
<Jmo4267> 2spooky?
<Pudge> AttacktheAndalite: Definitely not easy in this day and age
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: It's going to be like a shadow-world version of Valve. All the threequels will be a letdown!
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge: I know. And I've never had an actual job a day in my life so fun times
<Jmo4267> Dead Space 3 is practically Lost Planet.
<Marx> Dat Sumica spray.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA put so much money into DS3 that they need to sell 5 million copies to break even. Morons.
<Jmo4267> ikr
<Pudge> AttacktheAndalite: It's so liberating when you get one because you have a steady cash flow
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: I think you're worse than me at this right now.
<AttacktheAndalite> Who or what is doing that adorable giggle?
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge: I know, right? My parents send me money every two weeks and it's 100 dollars, not enough to live off of
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ahh. K.
<Pudge> Sumica: so much lag
<Reikim> Wrek|Observiking: May I join to perhaps help Sumi?
<Pudge> AttacktheAndalite: definitely not, you should look around
<twilight_sprinkle> btw Nittany_Discord i know you won the motherboard, but have you fixed your pc yet?
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge: With gas and Internet and necessities and there's a convention this weekend that I plan on attending
<scottish-geeky> luna is cute pink
<xtremetoxicguy> yay, stream works now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hehe
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish I could get a job. I need to straighten some health issues out first.
<Pudge> AttacktheAndalite: oh what convention?
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge: RoundCon, a local one.
<AttacktheAndalite> Sumi, is that you doing that adorable giggle? Or is it Wrek?
<Reikim> Sumica: Because spy?
<Dovah> Night everypony
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, Dovah
<Pudge> Ah a SC convention
<scottish-geeky> nithgy Dovah
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge: Yep.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> night Dovah
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile one thing that pisses me off alot is when people say a Croc-o-Style sniper is a noob who can't headshot. That is not true. Many Croc-o-Style snipers ignore the downsides and use expertise with the jarate and quick recharge.
<Pudge> once I get the cash I'm definitely flying to bronycon
<Lunar_Brony> I am one of them
<xtremetoxicguy> Cream GRAVY!
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge: all my envy
<Lunar_Brony> there is no "Bad weapon"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay Sumica!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6GLOMP PILE ON Nittany_Discord!
<Meanwhile> Lunar_Brony: Too bad that being a noob who can't headshot is all it makes you.

<Shamroc> Meanwhile...sound like he said you have been found wanted
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: But that'd make no sense.
<Shamroc> Meanwhile...well i mean wanted like...as in the LAW wants you..
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Why would the law want him?
<Shamroc> for IDK fakeing to be a bloody noble?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he did say wanting
<Sabershy> Grean
<Meanwhile> Yeah but they don't know he's faking.
<Shamroc> i know but still its all illegal.....soo yeah i win in a sense
*Alpha-Omega-Prime fighting internal conflict
<Meanwhile> No you don't you've failed.
<Sabershy> :D
<Jmo4267> ROfl
<Meanwhile> You look...something.
<Jmo4267> The bible.
<Sabershy> Alpha-Omega-Prime: Is there anything I can help?
<Meanwhile> Wow he is not smooth at all.
<Meanwhile> Just say wonderful
<Meanwhile> Or gorgeous.
<Meanwhile> It's not hard.
<Meanwhile> Dingbat.
<Spriggals> Whats this?
<Sabershy> That prick...
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I don't think you would want to
<Jmo4267> Smacking my face against my desk.
<Alchemist> is that heath ledger?
<Jmo4267> Indeed it is.
<cachi01|CaveStory> dem dances i will never understand
<Meanwhile> Why yes, yes it is.

<Sabershy> Alchemist: Oh wow, that looks like him.
<Spriggals> I this that jousting movie or am I way off?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that music change
<Meanwhile> Spriggals: That's what it is.
<Alchemist> whats the title of this movie?
<Meanwhile> A Knights Tale I think.
<ponibas> A Knight's Tale
<ponibas> if it's the one I thinkit is..
<Spriggals> What would have made this worse if jackblack was there
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it is
<ponibas> justing + Heath Ledger
<ponibas> bleh
<Meanwhile> Von Douchebag is in a bad mood.
<Alchemist> hmm, not that high score on imdb
<Alchemist> lets see how good it actually is
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> who cares for imdb i like this movie :p
<Sabershy> That jelousy! YES LET YOUR BUTT HURT FLOW THROUGH YOU!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its a personal favorite of mine
<Meanwhile> She works for Nikey?
<Spriggals> Nikie?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05grew up watching it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek|Observiking same /)
<ponibas> lol, I was grown up when it came out :p
<Meanwhile> Wham.
*Alpha-Omega-Prime wants that armor
<Sabershy> Wrek: You got good tastes then. :)
<Merc_Xephos> hello
<Meanwhile> That so? I will break his face.
<therainbowvortex> hello everypony
<Meanwhile> Hahahaaaa
<Alchemist> Whiterun guard armour?
<Meanwhile> Trolled.
<Alchemist> looked like one from the back
<Sabershy> therainbowvortex: Hello...!
<therainbowvortex> hey so has any pony seen xxmoopy
<therainbowvortex> xxmoopyxx i mean
<Meanwhile> If we had it'd be obvious because he'd be making a nuisance of himself.
<HatchetRyda> morning everypony
<therainbowvortex> i never see him on any more ah well
<Meanwhile> Allo HatchetRyda.
<HatchetRyda> what we watchin?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05he got ihmself banned after several infractions
<AttacktheAndalite> HatchetRyda: A movie
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and if i recall correctly ban evaded
<Meanwhile> Of course he did, he was a muppet.
<Sabershy> HatchetRyda: A Knight's Tale, I think.
<HatchetRyda> AttacktheAndalite: ^_^
<therainbowvortex> dose any pony here like truesoul116
<HatchetRyda> thanks Sabershy
<Spriggals> somone is a fan of Twilight...
<therainbowvortex> he dose fanfic readings
<Spriggals> :3
<Sabershy> HatchetRyda: No problem. :)
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Spriggals: mhmmmm
<Meanwhile> He is /not/ smooth at all.
<Sabershy> I don't recall most guys being... "smooth".
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I'm not either
<therainbowvortex> dose any pony know of truesoul116 :) ps whats the movie
<Meanwhile> It's all in the words.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i keep accidentally closing it
<Meanwhile> therainbowvortex: Movie is A Knights Tale. Have no idea who truesoul is.
<Spriggals> If only lancers were that good in battle
<Sabershy> Um, Wrek: Are you downloading Minecraft?
<Alchemist> Spriggals: you mean an actual battle? I thought they didnt deploy those kind of units during an actual battle.
<Spriggals> Heck they used Lancers in the Napleonic era
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :D
<Jmo4267> So smart.
<Alchemist> Spriggals: interesting, they seem pretty useless. give them a sword or a bow with the horse and they are much more effective
<Sabershy> I hope I don't work tomorrow. :\
<Meanwhile> Battle lancers could pierce through armour. If you think that the tournament ones could still crack the stuff, pointed fighting lances would impale something fierce.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Shizuschlafen ~ Sleep well
<Meanwhile> I'm naturally biased for lances though, given one half of my family history.
<Alchemist> Meanwhile: yes, pierce anything...once. Then you have to discard the lance.
<Spriggals> I would think lances would be a one hit kill but you can only(god this love letter :L) use the lance once before pulling out your sword and wingin it
<Sabershy> Alchemist: Unless its Gae-bolg.
<Alchemist> I dunno what that is
<Meanwhile> My family motto is "Spears amongst our enemies" We were royal lancers. I have to hold face for the chargers.
<therainbowvortex> is it weird that i had a dreem where pinkie was real and i shot haters and antibronys with her party cannon
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> No that's the best kind of dream
<Shamroc> haha
<Spriggals> No homo
<Jmo4267> HAHA.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he happy
<Alchemist> therainbowvortex: chances are you watched too many pony before going to bed :D
<Spriggals> YESSSS
<HatchetRyda> bromance!
<Alister> therainbowvortex: Yes it is weird , attacking someone because of their opinion is weird and wrong
<Sabershy> If you surround yourself with enough stimulus of a certain theme, it should affect the subject of your dreams, therainbowvortex.
<Sabershy> We need to go deeper.
<Meanwhile> French flags are white on French soil.
<therainbowvortex> also pinkie ate all my candy :(
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> who else but pinkie
<Meanwhile> Jesus is English?
<Alister> idiots
<Spriggals> French and english are always going at it
<Alister> Jesus was black
<Spriggals> lol
<cachi01|CaveStory> jesus
<Alchemist> I've yet to have a pony related dream... If I come to that I'll know I have to cut back on the stuff.
<therainbowvortex> at lest it wasent the cupcake dream :O
<cachi01|CaveStory> i want a pony related dream :(
<Sabershy> Me too, but I haven't a lot of time with ponies. Not yet anyways.
<Spriggals> I haven't either, I think its because no else knows my little secret idk...
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I have them all the time
<cachi01|CaveStory> Spriggals: which one?
<Meanwhile> I generally don't recall dreams.
<cachi01|CaveStory> Alpha-Omega-Prime: you lucky
<Spriggals> That one
<therainbowvortex> i think im obseed with ponys yay? 6_9
<Alchemist> Meanwhile: I do, for about 30 seconds after waking up. then poof, the freaking sandman collects it.
<therainbowvortex> or is that a bad thing :S
<Sabershy> Your breasts...
<Meanwhile> Your breast. Great start there.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ....:S
<cachi01|CaveStory> your breasts!
<Jmo4267> I lol'd
<Alchemist> obsession is bad imo, no matter what you are obsessing about
<Spriggals> WRONG
<Spriggals> Shoo
<Spriggals> Shoo father
<cachi01|CaveStory> FUCKING CAVE STORY IM ABOUT TO RAGE QUIT
<Sabershy> Told off.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> cave story?
<Sabershy> harraser of parraser?
<Meanwhile> Your eyes shine like saphire under amber waterfalls, through the light of golden eve. Poetry isn't that hard.
<Meanwhile> Honestly.
<Sabershy> Anyways, on the dreams thing.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05for me poetry out of the blue is hard
<Spriggals> Niether do i
<Meanwhile> It's all in /sounding/ fancy.
<Spriggals> Neither*
<Spriggals> w.e
<Alchemist> Im bad with words too. Even if I have time to prepare for it.
<Sabershy> Normally, you need to be asleep to dream,
<Meanwhile> As long as you sound like you know what you're doing, you'll be fine.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I must have inspiration for me to write poetry. That is how I wrote one to my friend and girl I likd
<therainbowvortex> have any of yall seen brotown
<Meanwhile> Nice catch.
<Buytoast> what a bitch
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :S ow
<Alchemist> some women just want to watch the men burn
<Sabershy> Oh, I felt that.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ....cool
<Meanwhile> Changed her mind.
<Spriggals> Women...
<Meanwhile> Goddamnit woman,.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ^
<Meanwhile> And how I hate her.
<Meanwhile> Good answer.
<Sabershy> And oh how I hate her...
<Spriggals> I think he is just saying that so the action in bed is better
<Jmo4267> Oh snap.
<Meanwhile> Hahaha
<Shamroc> dead
<Shamroc> haha
<Shamroc> caught the foul helm
<Spriggals> ...and...here...we...go.
<Alchemist> send her to the moon
<therainbowvortex> every pony
<therainbowvortex> brb
<Meanwhile> I missed you as the wheat misses the scythe you infernal goblin.
<Spriggals> rolf
<Sabershy> Its a trap.
<Spriggals> all this for a virgin
<Meanwhile> May Lucifer piss in your wine and may the heavens open the torrent upon you when you attempt to bathe in their light.
<cachi01|CaveStory> for the virgins!!
<Aloha-Omega-Prime> ....
<Spriggals> Well I know in his mind "It was worth it."
<cachi01> oops wrong password
<Meanwhile> He's as blunt as his lances.
<therainbowvortex> hey my dad might be back soon so i might need to get off my family dont know im a brony

<Meanwhile> Ulric gets the ladies. Despite talking to one like he's talking to a sack of flour.
<TheRandomkid321> JOUSTING!
<Meanwhile> Seen smoother sandpaper.

<Meanwhile> That line sounds...kinda gay.

<OtakuTom> She will be mine...oh yes...she WILL be mine.
*Sabershy gently brings out a hammer and nails...
<Meanwhile> If she's not he's going to burn Paris.
*Flootahshy provides a cross.
*Aloha-Omega-Prime brings a wooden cross
<Flootahshy> :|
<TheRandomkid321> *ellipsis*
*Aloha-Omega-Prime puts away cross
<Flootahshy> :)
<Sabershy> Why, thank you Flootahshy! :)
<Flootahshy> I helped!
<Spriggals> Dat english accent
<TheRandomkid321> Terrible wetha eh?
<OtakuTom> So yea...I may return to Star Wars: the Old Republic...once they open up the Free-to-play option in November.

<Jmo4267> tl;dr wall of text.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Then the are oviously not your friends
<Spriggals> Are you in Highshool or what?
<TheRandomkid321> SUdden lag... WALL OF TEXT! Is this your doing?
<Flootahshy> Alpha-Omega-Prime speaks the truth.
<Shamroc> Meanwhile...meet moopys freind...
<Buytoast> why in the hell would you tell others you watch the show?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05highschool is jsut about survival
<TheRandomkid321> ANd also that's why I only have one friend and I dont tell him I'm a brony
<Spriggals> Yea
<Wrek|Observiking> 05you basically tell nothing to no one
<Spriggals> Yea
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek true dat
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: I feel my resovoir of uncaring continuing.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05last 3 years
<Sabershy> therainbowvortex: Er, oh wow. I can't help you other than tell you that high school is crap and you'll never see them again when you leave.
<Buytoast> that's like painting your ass red in the prison showers saying "oh boy, I hope it isn't sausage saturday"
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Well one of my "friends" thinks I'm gay for liking ponies and playing ponymon.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05you "may" be able to
<Shamroc> Meanwhile..indeed...
<Wrek|Observiking> 05depending on if you have a tight knit friend circle
<Meanwhile> Aye, in high school, you keep your mouth shut and try not to tread on anyone's feet.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05atleast in america
<TheRandomkid321> THis movie seesm good.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05casue that place be dangerous
<Meanwhile> And in England.
<Spriggals> You get friends Freshmeat year and hopefully they will stick with you
<therainbowvortex> they made school so bad i just totaly skiped school today and im gona tomorow and the next day
<Buytoast> ya blew it
<Meanwhile> England is hardly dangerous compared to America, doesn't stop you getting beat up in school though.
<MASF123|LeggoMyEggo> What movie is this?
<TheRandomkid321> theraibowvortex DO a sonic rainboom into their face.
<Sabershy> A Knight's Tale
<Wrek|Observiking> 05heck my firends cicrcle consists of 2 bisexuals, one a gamer gal. anotehr one that is an animefreak and into the kinkier stuff. and 3 cosntant magic the gathering players.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I don't get beat up. People for some reason or another olike and respect me
<TheRandomkid321> Is taht old fellow Ulrics father?
<Attack|Relaxed> Survival of the fittest=high school
<therainbowvortex> that an awsome idear
<Wrek|Observiking> 05all in all we are great friends
<Shamroc> Wrek|Observiking......sounds EXACTLY like my group of freinds last year....
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Alpha-Omega-Prime: i havent had bullyign problesm sicne i broke ones ribcage
<TheRandomkid321> inb4 Creepy dude murders ulric
<MASF123|LeggoMyEggo> ...quite a strange group of friends, Wrek
<Jmo4267> Oh that's always lovely.
<Spriggals> Wrek where m at everything is 1950's go with us or be shamed
<MASF123|LeggoMyEggo> But they are friends none-the-less
<Attack|Relaxed> My group of friends consists of anime fans and a few bronies. Mmm, the lulz that take place when we hang out.
<TheRandomkid321> His father died?
<therainbowvortex> the problem is that they say they hate them but they bring them up more then me a school :|:|
<Sabershy> Unfortunately, the latino community aren't as accepting of bronies as english.
<Meanwhile> As for the last couple years, you don't bully the dealer. We played cards all the time.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I've always held my cool because when I get mad I won't stop untill I hear bones break or lack of breathing.
<TheRandomkid321> Sabershy WHAT!? SAY WAHT!?
<Meanwhile> I'm inclined to ask how you can hear lack of breathing.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05then again the bullies back then were the soccer fanatics who were more or less the biggest pansies you could imagine
<Sabershy> Sorry, but the mexs, I hanged with, I was better off with my mouth shut.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i say soccer not to confuse you
<Spriggals> Everyone in my school is aiming for sex, not even sports
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Spriggals: you poor soul.
<Spriggals> xD
<Meanwhile> 16 year old pregnancy get.
<Alister> Spriggals: You could take advantage of that
<Sabershy> Alister: Don't encourage those types of ideas.
<Attack|Relaxed> Meanwhile, I think the new age for that is 14 or 15 now.
<TheRandomkid321> Current generations prime objectives. Sex Tobacco Alchohol Drugs sex and most prominent! Sex!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile so they aim for MTV ?
<Meanwhile> I hate the youth.
<therainbowvortex> the problem is that they say they hate them but they bring them up more then me at school maby they say i must be gay to like the show :|:|
<Spriggals> I remember Freshman year im 14 tell my friends I haven't had sex and they look at me like im crazy
<Wrek|Observiking> 05people rarely get accepting of anythign untill they are around 18+
<Alister> Sabershy: Because , of course , I was completly serious
<Meanwhile> I want to hit them with kayak paddles.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and by that time if they still ar ent
<Wrek|Observiking> 05there isnt much they can do about it
*Sabershy sighs
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and if they do
<Sabershy> Just saying.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well
<TheRandomkid321> Meanwhile I technically am a youth. But not the steryotypical youth.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05police ftw
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> My group of friends....I stopped hanging out with them after I started isolating myself from people
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the random youth?
<Flootahshy> That need to been on a plaque, Wrek.
<therainbowvortex> can you belive that every pony
<Meanwhile> Live to fight another day you loony.
<Alister> or fight for glory today
<Wrek|Observiking> 05what?
<Attack|Relaxed> Spriggals: More power to you by not giving in to peer pressure. By the time you graduate, there's probably some chick your age getting pregnant right now and possibly dropping out of school because she can't take care of herself and the child and her parents refuse to help her
<Wrek|Observiking> 05then you can find joy in the fact that the same gal was the one making fun out of you
<Spriggals> Oh there are 16 year olds doing that right now
<MASF123|LeggoMyEggo> Will there ever be a PotC5? I keep hearong rumors it is in production.
<Attack|Relaxed> Spriggals: I have no doubts about it.
<TheRandomkid321> There are 13 year old girls doing that right now!
<Flootahshy> PotC5?
<Spriggals> lol
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> My school was literaly full of losers. The fail percentage was 80%
<MASF123> Pirates of the Carribian 5
<Attack|Relaxed> TheRandomkid321: There are 11 year olds doing it right now, I bet
<OtakuTom> There's supposed to be a whole new trilogy, so there'll also be a 6th
<Wrek|Observiking> 05someone said this movie had a low score on imdb
<therainbowvortex> spriggals that hapaned to a relly close freind of mine now we never talk because she dosent want people judging her
<Wrek|Observiking> 05cant really get why
<TheRandomkid321> Attack|Relaxed ANd if it was possible I bet 6 year old girls would be doing it right now... Too far?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05must be the soundtrack
<Meanwhile> Probably.
<HatchetRyda> Attack|Relaxed: 11, really?!
<TheRandomkid321> The movie itself seems good
<Wrek|Observiking> 05TheRandomkid321: not really. the second pubwerty hits you loose control over such things
<Meanwhile> lose*
<Attack|Relaxed> TheRandomkid321: Not at all, with the way the media pressures girls to act waay older than their age earlier and earlier, it seems
<Wrek|Observiking> 05adn as a parent thinkign you have it under control is foolign yourself
<OtakuTom> It's a good movie, but for some reason it wasn't well received overall. I think it was the history buffs that hated how inaccurate it was.
<TheRandomkid321> That little bugger
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the best thing you can do is to provide your kid with a proper moral and ethical base. and hope that he or she can think for him/her self
<Attack|Relaxed> HatchetRyda: Yes. Middle schoolers.
<MASF123> OtakuTom, so there will also be a 6...
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Makes sense respect him for being a knight. Then when he is on a display treat him like crap
<HatchetRyda> Attack|Relaxed: thats just sad
<OtakuTom> MASF123: That's what I heard when the 4th came out.
<Attack|Relaxed> HatchetRyda: Mhm
<TheRandomkid321> Mayby this guy is the reason for the low ratin
<Meanwhile> Suddenly fresh produce.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and instead of bashing your 15 year old pregnant daughter support her and make her to think logically
<Sabershy> I like the speaker. He is pretty good.
<therainbowvortex> every pony i think im close to convetinf a freind into a brony
<TheRandomkid321> Yes throw food despite us being peasents and needing every small bit!
<MASF123> On Stranger Tides was good, however some people didn't like it.
<Attack|Relaxed> I have yet to see the fourth Pirates movie.
<MASF123> I admit is wasn't best of the series, but it was still enjoyable.
<TheRandomkid321> I loked the latest Pirate Of the Carribean movie.
<TheRandomkid321> *likdd
<TheRandomkid321> *liked
<Meanwhile> Heard the last one kinda sucked.
<Attack|Relaxed> Got one through three on DVD, but I need a new copy of each.
<MASF123> The Mermaids were the best part pf the movie, IMO.
<Meanwhile> Been avoiding it for the sake of my opinion on the series.
<MASF123> part
<HatchetRyda> Attack|Relaxed: why?
<TheRandomkid321> MASF123 :|
<therainbowvortex> i dont like the forth pirates of the caribiean
<Attack|Relaxed> HatchetRyda: Scratched.
<Shamroc> suddenly....he is a good guy...and...doing so just so he can kill the dude..
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> He is royalty?
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Eh?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc is not the same dude
<TheRandomkid321> Shamroc Spoilers much?
<Shamroc> oh damnit
<HatchetRyda> Attack|Relaxed: well i know what to get some one neeext~ :)
<Meanwhile> Oh right. Shamroc thought it was the douche guy
<Shamroc> ^
<TheRandomkid321> OFF WITH YA HED!
<Sabershy> Nice! I like fair and kind kings!
<TheRandomkid321> Or he really was just knighting him...
<MASF123> Wait, has anyone even seen the 4th film to judge it like that?
<Shamroc> TheRandomkid321: thought it was the douche...seting him free just so he could kick his ass later
<Meanwhile> Technically this is a prince.
<Spriggals> ...and then they were dead
<Attack|Relaxed> HatchetRyda, I wonder what it is.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05she doesnt look happy
<TheRandomkid321> inb4 he dies in thsi joust... It aint a spoiler if I am soeculating
<Sabershy> MASF123: I have seen it. It was good. Since the love triangle though was gone, I felt it was lacking a bit in the drama. However the action was amusing. :)
<HatchetRyda> Attack|Relaxed: *giggle* you'll just have to wait and see cutie
<Meanwhile> Cheating bastard.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> cheater
<Attack|Relaxed> HatchetRyda, d'aww
<MASF123> Sabershy the part with Jack being tied to a tree with Captain Barbosa was pretty funny
<TheRandomkid321> Wait he has an illegal weapon!
<Meanwhile> That guy just doesn't have the same kind of energy.
<Meanwhile> He hesitates and that makes him look awkward.
<therainbowvortex> some guys at school told me to go kill mysely and that i was going to hell and beter then me just because i was a brony :(:'(:'(:[:[
<MASF123> He should just kill them
