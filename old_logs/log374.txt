<Artemis> [22:36:14] <~Artemis> [18:40:23] <~Artemis> but Indie doesn't want them to
<Artemis> [22:36:20] <~Artemis> [19:55:56] <~Artemis> also note to self: Nathan needs to save Rhy sometime while she's trapped
<Artemis> [22:36:20] <~Artemis> [19:56:19] <~Artemis> note number 2: Rhy needs to do a cliche back-to-opponent, who runs up, and then she kills him in 3 hits
<ShinitaiHana> *covers ears*

<FlutterPie> Drug land 6_9
<CMTAAA> crap i puked all over my keyboard
<GLaDOS> It's Megan and Applejack!
<GLaDOS> :D
<Hazard3> it was great!
<Artemis> instead of Nathan + Leo rescuing Rhy
<ShinitaiHana> a Big Lipped Alligator Moment!
<Sundaysmile> and then we never saw them again
<Jesus> i;ll call you with this SEASHELL
<Tovler> an episode with Hippocamps would be nice.
<Artemis> And having Nathan kidnapped and Rhy with Leo just doesn't make sense
<SelfishMercury> yay... seafood
<pony_739> what's the countdown to?
<dshannon> let me sing you the song of my people!
<AnonyPony-EQD> wing boner?

<Buytoast> The Smurfs
<A11ectis> Dem 'shrooms/
<TeamDerpy> wing boners!
<Chaospony> How many people wanna bet that she calls the sea ponies again? If you think so say so.
<GLaDOS> The smurfs?
<dshannon> shrroooooooms
<pony_5924> ponies in wonderland?
<CMTAAA> are those mushrooms magic?
<Drake> 04SInce Nathan usually stays AWAY from enemies
<Sundaysmile> the drug baron!
<pony_5924> SUPER MARIO!
<AnonyPony-EQD> Nightmare moon?
<Hazard3> OMG
<AnonyPony-EQD> RAINBOW!
<GLaDOS> The night...shall last...FOREVER!
<Yellowquiet> my personal dealer ^^
<dshannon> hers eyes say eveything
<Tovler> That reminds me. That new Water Pony Pokemon became official this week.
<Sundaysmile> rainbow of darkness?
<Artemis> yeah
<A11ectis> IS that a condom?
<Artemis> and it just doesn't seem right either, Drake
<AnonyPony-EQD> yes

<AnonyPony-EQD> XD
<dshannon> wut
<AnonyPony-EQD> Lulz
<Hazard3> yes it is
<DeathPony> Thats Twilight's mod :D
<ShinitaiHana> Hipster Angle bunny...
<Tovler> Meg's hat is not a condom
<DeathPony> mom
<Chaospony> Rainbow of Darkness? It could just be the Cutie Mark Crusaders with a vacum dude.
<Drake> 04[19:55:56] <~Artemis> also note to self: Nathan needs to save Rhy sometime while she's trapped
<Egrus> BULLSHIT.
<Drake> 04I like this one though
<Hazard3> shut up angel
<GLaDOS> I'm imagining this guy as Celestia and Twilight as G4 Twilight.
<FlutterPie> NO!!

<FlutterPie> GIGGLE AT THE GHOSTIES!
<SelfishMercury> HA HA HA
<Jesus> srsly? ANNOTHER song?
<Artemis> I'd say she'd get into shitty situations
<Buytoast> ugh, a bug
<Sundaysmile> theres a song every 20 seconds in this movie
<Hazard3> XD
<SelfishMercury> needs more shit music imo
<Artemis> especially since she's more used to handling CQC rather than guns
<Buytoast> ahurhurhur
<GLaDOS> Rainbow of Light > makes a Rainbow > Elements of harmony > makes a rainbow
<Buytoast> peaCOCK
<Kid> Tom Bombadil?
<GLaDOS> :O THERE THE SAME
<Chaospony> I can't believe that I'm saying this but...NOT ANOTHER MLP SONG!!!
<Artemis> therefore it's even more likely
<Hazard3> this music is just crazy
<A11ectis> Save us John de Lance!
<Artemis> I forgot the exact scenario I had in mind
<AnonyPony-EQD> Rainbow dash?

<Artemis> lmao
<Tovler> I need to hear the Flim Flam brothers song to cleanse myself.
<Drake> 04Rhy: "...Fuck."
<SelfishMercury> bring back the sea ponies
<Egrus> This is more like fast talking than a song.
<Hazard3> the only thing worse than this is G3
<SelfishMercury> shoo be doo
<Jesus> who puts a rainbow in a flower pot?
<Noir> Rodger must have it.
<dshannon> ANGEL!
