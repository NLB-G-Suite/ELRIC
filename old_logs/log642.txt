<DSNesmith> then I can learn to say aboot
<Canadian_Brony> Chicks dig RD

<Silver_Spoon> but not as awesome as me :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, you mean Blackgryphon?
<sub06905> Shrek*

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Ponyinabox - Daring Do and Doctor Whooves Shorts
<CrimsonPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, why did this remind you of Shrek 2?
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: I really didn't see the point in the last movie.
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: The joker didn't die -- in fact, a lot of people have made fun of the fact that he should've gotten released along with everyone else in DKR
<richfiles> A firey steed... Twi, right! :$
<AJIsAwesome> *a point*
<Kimori> it just needed a needle to play
<Cades[phone]> wow
<Canadian_Brony> 3 was terrible, 4 was the worst but atleast it ENDED the series.
<Algol> the next year, he went to Reis' stand again, and he recognized my friend
<XylemTube> Rarity want's a high society prince and wonders why she ends up chasing Prince Doucebag
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: And I don't recall what you're talking about with the bandits.
<OohShiny> CrinsomPhoenix: the fairy singed it
<Kimori> It was a buck because of how hard it is to find a needle
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: how could he have survived that fall? plus he killed those people with the car bomb in the factory place
<Kimori> you need a good one too if you want it to sound good
<CrimsonPhoenix> OohShiny, I know she did
<kirzstryfe> nice
<lowfn> Bai everypony. Have a nice day.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: True. 3 was bad, but 4 shouldn't evem had existed IMO.

<VenHur> SlurryMoon: The FREAKING Mythbusters?! *gives taco suit* That's it, you're my new sidekick.

<otakon> AlienWarhead: in Arkham games she is
<HoodyNinja> Imagine, if only the Joker and Discord teamed up
<JESmith71> Tara only did Harley in Arkham City
<Algol> so did they reveal what it'll be?
<tSparx> AlienWarhead: Nope

<CrimsonPhoenix> Derpy_Hooves, not harley
<otakon> AlienWarhead: averted in this ep

<Petrified_Discord> "This is how it ends, Joker. No big schemes. No grand fight to the finish with the Dark Knight. Tomorrow, all the papers will say that the great Joker was found, blown to bits in an alley, alongside a miserable little nobody. Kind of funny. Ironic, really. See, I can destroy a man's dreams, too. And that's really the only dream you've got, isn't it?"
<Canadian_Brony> HoodyNinja just keep a close eye on 'em. They're too young to be drinking.

<otakon> Sumica: well every broken bone can heal...eventually
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: And he likes to flip it.

<Canadian_Brony> it's numerous bones
<Buytoast> getting crushed by a giant penny
<otakon> Sumica: well they are a tough bunch, maybe they survived
<OohShiny> Batman is worst than Jack Bauer
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: he already did
<Petrified_Discord> Sumica: Capitalism killed them
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why didnt he let the coin go?

<Algol> ADVENTURE TO SAXY'S HOPELESS QUEST TO HOOK UP WITH THE HOT VAs

<otakon> HoodyNinja: well did she look cute in them?
<XylemTube> Greese guns
<Algol> I MEAN, GET INTERVIEWS
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I forgot tha backstory, who is Harley again before she became Joker's sidekick?
<OohShiny> I wonder what kind of traps he would design if he was Jigsaw.
<HoodyNinja> otakon: Um, I'm not exactly if she
<Canadian_Brony> Set phasers to hug!
<KayBrony> I see no difference between this and the real life
<Yahooz> you shouldve stayed for bronypalooza
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> badum tsh
<HoodyNinja> is a girl that you would call cute
<OohShiny> ba dum tis
<Buytoast> a psychiatrist at arkham or something
<HoodyNinja> fail
<Algol> I would've
<Kencolt> The Joker. Much likemPinkie Pie, except actively criminal, homicidal, and totally the wrong kind of laughter. Hi, everyone.
<kirzstryfe> and the org... >.>
<HoodyNinja> SPLODING CARDS!
<Algol> but there was no way I could've gotten back home
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How do you put explosives in cards?
<Yahooz> Tara practically belly danced for us when Alex S played his set
<tSparx> HoodyNinja: I'm sorry, we live in the 21st century and you're a brony, someone's being a furry is no reason to be all creeped out and uncomfortable. (I don't know why I'm picking on you Hoody, I'll stop)
<otakon> hiya Kencolt you pop in WAY after BMN
<[SWAG]Haku> KayBrony I see one difference; the Host is actually entertaining
<HoodyNinja> Kencolt: HI
<AJIsAwesome|phone> Sorry, my internet died so I'm using my phone.
<Algol> but she's married
<Yahooz> the orgy was a rumor
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: coat them in explosive liquid
<OohShiny> well, Joker as Jigsaw
<Spectrum_Rush> Petrified_Discord: may have too show 'im that tomorrow i think his names just idling now
<owloysius> You laugh, you die?
<Algol> Saxy don't play dat game
<kirzstryfe> there's always an orgy
<Quick_Thinker> electric chaiir... yeah this was not very kid friendly
<kirzstryfe> if there's a con, there's an orgy
<Kencolt> otakon: Hd other things to watch-- I'll usually catch the Saturaday show.
<otakon> They laugh, he dies
<Quick_Thinker> and thats why it was awesome
<otakon> Kencolt: ah
<Algol> or at the veyr least
<owloysius> oops.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does Batman even have a sense of humor?
<Polydunami> I was busy the entire movie night :S
<KayBrony> [SWAG]Haku lol
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: You know the phrase, "It's Pinkie Pie, don't question it"? It's the Joker, don't question it.
<Canadian_Brony> Joker is dissapoint
<[SWAG]Haku> Here's how to kill Batman: Create an elaborate plan to bring out Bats, then while you explain your eveil plan, have a sniper take him out
<Spectrum_Rush> SpadeMagnes[R]: yes, yes he does
<Algol> some lonely desperate soul attempting to get one going
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Batman has a sense of humor?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I've never seen him laugh once
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx I just shorten it to "It's Pinkie Pie". That's all you really need.
<twilight_sprinkle> is Robin even alive at this point?
<Ryunosuke> she... giggled... at the ghosties
<otakon> HoodyNinja: well still if you don't like her just tell her. You shouldn't let the whole "furry" thing throw you off there if you *do* like someone.
<[SWAG]Haku> Batmans laugh is scary
<Buytoast> he laughed in the last episode
<XylemTube> oh boy
<Polydunami> You haven't seen Batman & Robin, SpadeMagnes[R]?
<OohShiny> lol
<Quick_Thinker> ah fuck
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: I usually just say, "Pinkie"
<Buytoast> when charlie scared joker
<owloysius> NO2!!!!!!
<Polydunami> Actually, that doesn't count as canon for me.
<HoodyNinja> tSparx: I told her I watched a show for little girls about ponies, and I think she's even more interested in me :/
<otakon> dat phonebook
<[SWAG]Haku> HAHAHAHAHAHA

<Quick_Thinker> HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHA DIE BATS
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So hwo did Joker kill Robin?
<KayBrony> LOLOLOL
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: if I may suggest, show the episode where Batman laughs, to show our viewers that Batman has a "sense of Humor"
<otakon> suddenly Catwoman
<superretroworld> HoodyNinja: you got lucky
<Ryunosuke> suddenly catwoman
<OohShiny> Cat Woman!
<[SWAG]Haku> AHAHA AHAHAHAHA

<Quick_Thinker> catwoment saves him huh
<Petrified_Discord> It's Feline Female!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Isnt cat woman a bad guy? Girl in this case
<Algol> I mean, what are Jennifer Hale and John DiMaggio doing at a Brony Convention?
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: he caught him and beat him up, and then blew up the building he was in
<Buytoast> she's both
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: Chaotic neutral
<Buytoast> or something like that
<OohShiny> SpadeMagnes
<Canadian_Brony> fail locking system
<Petrified_Discord> SpadeMagnes[R]: Anti-heroine
<Quick_Thinker> Spades shes free lance sometimes good some times bad
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> SpadeMagnes[R]: she's more Neutral
<HoodyNinja> The rock was still a better story
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: More chaotic good in TAS
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnet[R] she goes back and forth a lot
<SpadeMagnes[R]> She has a thing for batman doesnt she
<kirzstryfe> hanging out?
<Quick_Thinker> ahahhaahahahahahahahaahahhaha
<Kencolt> SpadeMagnes[R]: She's kind of both. SHe doesn't steal for profit somuch as a thrill... and he won't hurt the innocent.
<[SWAG]Haku> You know, all the villains are able to put up a fight against Batman, so what if... they all teamed up?
<Yahooz> for lolz
<OohShiny> SpadeMagnes[R]: she's an Anti-Hero, much like Vegeta and Shadow the Hedgehog
<[SWAG]Haku> Just to fight Batman
<[SWAG]Haku> No one else
<Quick_Thinker> Haku they did
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnet[R] Of course
<Quick_Thinker> it still fialed
<otakon> HoodyNinja: hmmm well all I can say is treat it like any other girl showing interest in you. You get to know her, you don't think it would work then call it off.
<HoodyNinja> [SWAG]Haku: I already tried that idea, got shot down
<Spectrum_Rush> SpadeMagnes[R]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman
<[SWAG]Haku> But what if they did it the right way?
<Canadian_Brony> PAWNCH

<thelonepony> yawn
<Ponies47> It's nearly 3:00 AM. I should of een sleeping a hour a go :$
<Ponies47> *been
<AdamTheDuck> Sleep is for the weak :3
<Moopy> wow really you had to say that
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<thelonepony> need moar coffe
<scout19_tf2> my god im tired
<Moopy> its like 3:56 over here
<DashWithRainbows> Silly people, you need to train your body to survive on low amounts of sleep.
<thelonepony> it's almost like 3:00 am
<scout19_tf2> yea but it 3 am over here
<DashWithRainbows> Pfft.
<DashWithRainbows> almost 9am
<DashWithRainbows> still awake
<flutterchu> hello everyone/hey satrun did you get my mseeage
<Moopy> im still staying up late still
<thelonepony> hi Flutterchu
<AdamTheDuck> Hello flutterchu
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: WAY ahead of you on that one :P
<Ponies47> Hey flutterchu
<DashWithRainbows> orly?
<Moopy> yup
<DashWithRainbows> done a week of no sleep yet Ponies47?
<DashWithRainbows> No caffiene either.
<AdamTheDuck> Now that's just unhealthy :P
<flutterchu> so my fanfic has been cancelled so im workig on a new one
<DashWithRainbows> Yep, too bad I still done it :3
<Moopy> wow dashwithrainbow just wow
<DashWithRainbows> if I done it for another week, I would run the risk of dying. 3-4 days without sleep causes you to have hallucinations.
<DashWithRainbows> Best week of my life.
<Moopy> :|
<thelonepony> i need food !
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: Nopr. Most I've done is 36 hours :$
<Ponies47> *nope
<flutterchu> my fanfic is about Tord going to equestria
<DashWithRainbows> Ponies47 I guess your body knows its limits then.
<DashWithRainbows> It took me 3 hours to actually fall asleep on that week.
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: BUCK THAT (squee)! I'm going to change that! :D
<DashWithRainbows> Don't say I didn't warn you.
<Moopy> lolz
<flutterchu> DashWithRainbows: i havnt slept in 11 day's so i wont be argueing
<DashWithRainbows> Also, it's best to do it when you have a week of nothing planned.
<Jmo> lol 11 days
<DashWithRainbows> Otherwise, school and other things will just wreck your energy supply.
<Moopy> school is boring
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: Oh like when I did the 36 hour thing? Everypony keept on telling me to go to bed. I didn't listen and 36 hours later. I crashed. HARD :S
<flutterchu> why do you have so many windows at once
<AdamTheDuck> why the depressing music Phase4 ? :(
<DashWithRainbows> Because he wants people to have feels.
<DashWithRainbows> Or he just likes the song.
<DashWithRainbows> can't blame him.
<Ponies47> Don't even get me started on how many times I have almost fell alseep in school -_-
<flutterchu> Ponies47: me neither
<AdamTheDuck> I like it, it's just I was in such a good mood :/
<DashWithRainbows> Ponies47 English class, form tutor is my English teacher. She was known to be the most boring teacher in the school.
<Moopy> heh i did that a couple times at my school to dude
<DashWithRainbows> I fell asleep pretty much every lesson.
<Lil_B> tell me about it... Friday, the last 2 school hours, Politics and Economy, with the most boring Teacher, who can't make anything sound interesting even if he tried (and he doesn't) ... so many people fell asleep
<Moopy> teachers are boring
<flutterchu> i was just trying to be hush now quiet now it's not my fault im tear drop
<Sabershy> Good... um, its night time here, so I guess it is good night?
<Ponies47> I think school is just plain out boring. I hate every single moment of it. My mom says that highschool are the best 4 years of your life. You know what I say to that? BULL(Squee)
<DashWithRainbows> You'll regret saying that later in life.
<Moopy> :D
<DashWithRainbows> I miss being in Year 9.
<Sabershy> POnies47: High school was fun; wait till you graduate to feel it.
<DashWithRainbows> And right now, I'm in my second year of sixth form.
<DashWithRainbows> CHERISH YOUR CHILDHOOD.
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: I am a freshman
<DashWithRainbows> I have no idea what that is.
<MASF123> Freshman is a 9th grader
<Lil_B> or the last theory lessong we had before we could finally start making actual work... 4 horurs of streight up pushing information into us via a Presentation... wwe call it mannheimer Funnel
<DashWithRainbows> Being English and being part of its educational system.
<Moopy> i think that every school in the world need to turn into a live video games instead of doing other stuff you know
<twilight_sprinkle> when i graduated high school i didnt feel anything but "FINALLY"
<DashWithRainbows> I assume 9th grader is basically year 9 or year 8.
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: Year 9
<DashWithRainbows> Ah. Yeah, seems about right.
<twilight_sprinkle> and i still dont miss my high school, and i never will.
<DashWithRainbows> The only thing I miss are the friends who weren't douchbags.
<DashWithRainbows> also, brb.
<Moopy> i hate my school so much it gets me into trouble alot and it makes me upset all the time cause i casued so much dramma in school
<Ponies47> Pfft. I didn't have any friends in middle school and seems like the same thing iss going to happen for high school :|

<AdamTheDuck> Yay lets participate as victims!
*sub06905 remembers Steve Jobs vs. Bill Gates :$
<Dark_Horst> sub06905: spamming a server with contact requests until it breaks down under the load
<Sonny> it's longer then 10 minutes :D

<JRP> 21/9/12
*sub06905 shall learn tonight
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: the 4chan "hacker's" favourite attack
<flutterchu> JRP: the season 3 premere
<MLP_Brovakiin> JRP: Quit spamming, it hasn't been anounced yet
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, yeah, they talk about that in this talk
<MLP_Brovakiin> I don't think
<Dark_Horst> aaaand there they are
<JRP> I'll laugh if I was right
<Sonny> Anonymous are awesome
<flutterchu> what the fuck is this
<Sonny> don't know
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: whats this vid called?
<JRP> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<JRP> There is the date
<Phase4> 00,02"DEFCON 19: Three Generations of DoS Attacks (with Audience Participation, as Victims)"
<Dark_Horst> thanks
<JRP> Unknown
<Kammerjunk> Well, at least they don't treat "Anoymous" as a secret hacker group.
<Kammerjunk> Because that's silly.
<JRP> Lies
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: that's becasue this guy probally actually knows what he's blabbering about
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<Phase4> 00,02this is a talk at defcon
<Kandarihu> I'm liking this Th3j3st3r
<Phase4> 00,02everyone there understands whats going on :P
<Kammerjunk> "skilled" Yup.
<JRP> Phase4 you know the date
<Phase4> 00,02i know the what now?
<Sonny> I love them
<Dark_Horst> pbs?
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, american tv station
<flutterchu> what the fuck is this some presentation at the whitehouse
<Dark_Horst> fucking kids
<Hoofsock> Feel free to message me I'm bored x3
<Sonny> Goverment websties are corrupt
<Phase4> 00,02flutterchu, no, defcon talk
<Kandarihu> Sort of a US Government owned TV station, but all the shows are viewer-supported
<Kandarihu> Er, not station, network
<MadSurge> I know nothing about coding... :(
<sub06905> ^
<MadSurge> But I'm happy that some people are addressing the problem of anonymous fucking around the web
<MLP_Brovakiin> If anything happend to bronystate I would cry :(
<Buytoast> don't worry
<flutterchu> this is a terrible and funny presentatoin
<Buytoast> it's not the season yet
<Kandarihu> MLP_Brovakiin, the website has been DDOS'd during episode premiers before.
<MadSurge> MLP_Brovakiin: you weren't here during Hurricane Fluttershy, were you?
<Ihop> fun times
<Moopy> Cans.wave.
<MLP_Brovakiin> MadSurge: Nope, I only found out about broynstate 6 weeks aago
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, to be fair normal trafic during an episode is like a ddos
<sub06905> wow
<Phase4> 00,02its gona get worse next seasion
<Prince_Blueblood> this network is pretty hardy
<Prince_Blueblood> if the web app doesn't work use a regular chat client
<Kencolt> That voice... it's like listening to a tech-savvy Rush Limbaugh.
<Phase4> 00,02been working hard to stop that, should have no downtime for season 3 if everything goes ok
<Moopy> hey have you ponies herd of radio graffiti?
<Ihop> that dosent hate you
<Kandarihu> You remember that incident with the premier of Hurricane Fluttershy, right?
<sub06905> like 3000+ people are going to tune in for season 3?
<Phase4> 00,02we had 10k viewers for the end of season 2
<flutterchu> STOP HITTTING BACK flutterchu
<sub06905> wow
<sub06905> 10k
<Phase4> 00,02its not going to be a smaller number for the start of season 3
<sub06905> 20k?
<MLP_Brovakiin> I have this funny mental image of the mods standing arounf the bronystate servers with fire extingishers on premere nights :D
<sub06905> the chat will be speedy during season 3
<Phase4> 00,02sub06905, i'm targeting at least 25k clients for the site
<sub06905> 25k.... now thats a lot tuning in
<Ihop> wants to learn about computers no math skills
<Phase4> 00,02dont think we'll get that many but it doesnt hurt to be capable of that
<MadSurge> Dat pic :D
<sub06905> ^
<Phase4> 00,02Ihop, you can get away without math usualy, you need to know the basic stuff of course
<Hoofsock> ._.
<Kencolt> The thing is, ponies from all over the planet want to see the premiere... but unless you have actual access to the HUB (which I do, yay) your only resource is ann online stream. And we're one of the more popular.
<sub06905> Mac OS, windows, and linux all at the same time
<Kencolt> As the community grows, so do the amount of bronies who just can't wait for the latest YouTube version. SO...
<Phase4> 00,02he's gona fumble around with this for a bit
<Phase4> 00,02vmware has broke on him
<Kencolt> In other words, as sensible as it may be for that guy in Madagastar on a 56K line with an old laptop to wait-- he wants it NAO.
<MadSurge> You know this video by heart, Phase4?
<Ihop> tfw you joind ponys to watch it burn from start to finish
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, not really, just seen it before
<Moopy> that looks like a hack
<Phase4> 00,02its a denial of service attack
<Phase4> 00,02blocks clients
<Moopy> oh well to me it is
<Hoofsock> Bored :3
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Phase4> 00,02LEARN
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Dark_Horst> a hack is an invasion of a foreign system. a dos is just throwing shit at a system
<JRP|temp> im famous
<flutterchu> im gonna go to bed bye
<Hoofsock> :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight flutterchu
<MadSurge> I don't wanna learn, but I respect Phase4 for being able to understand this :$
<Ihop> i like learning
<Ihop> lol windows 8
<Dark_Horst> gotta try that
<Phase4> 00,02windows 8 is vulnderable to this too
<Phase4> 00,02its bizare
<Ihop> cool
<Dark_Horst> well, microspft
<JRP|temp> fuck
<Dark_Horst> thy probably leave that loophole unplugged on purpose
<JRP|temp> I SEND ME LAPTOP TO GET FIXED IT AND GET IT BACK TO FIND THEY DID DIDLEY DICK
<Phase4> 00,02one day i want to get something on ms's network and run that attack
<JRP|temp> WAT A BLOODY JOKE
<Dark_Horst> we all know they want to controll what they sell
<Phase4> 00,02JRP|temp, LESS CANTERLOCK PLS
<JRP|temp> im so mad
<Kandarihu> So this Router Advertisement attack is really something that can't be used against distant websites?
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, its 'link local', can only be used on the local network segment
<JRP|temp> toshiba can suck my nutr
<Phase4> 00,02basically not past a router
<Kandarihu> I see.
<Kammerjunk> I guess that's why Microsoft doesn't really care.
<Phase4> 00,02its not hard to fix, infact it could probably be fixed by a 3rd party
<Phase4> 00,02this guy is from cloudflare, we use them for bronystate
<Ihop> lulzsec is weird
<Phase4> 00,02ohai pony_9568

<Phase4> 00,02i love how people didnt really have a problem with lulzsec until they attacked minecraft
<Phase4> 00,02its great the world works that way

<Ihop> captain router
*MaxTheBrony Eating a gigant warm sandwich with ham and cheese , yummy
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, he'd probably have trouble, the slorris attack is most effective against apache due to the way it works
<Kandarihu> I see
<Phase4> 00,02lighthttpd is somewhat better against it (thats what piratebay uses) and nginx is even better again
<Ihop> man i hate not knowing things

<applejack`> what's mean canonically?
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hey Bronysith
<Wrek> 05it means "It has not been shown or explained in the show, so we dont know."
<Bronysith> time for Shadow of The Colossus
<Bronysith> <3
<Sonny> Scootaloo needq an episode
<Sonny> :(
<Bronysith> APPLEJACK NEEDS A SONG
<Sonny> needs* >_>
<applejack`> xD
<Bronysith> thats the most top priority right now
<Sonny> yup
<applejack`> applejack don't have a song?
<mruczek> nope
<Sonny> :O
<Bronysith> y? cause ONE TIME CHARACTERS HAD THEIR OWN SONGS BEFORE APPLEJACK
<applejack`> please, i can read, so don't use shift/capslock
<applejack`> :)
<Wrek> 05what?
<Sonny> haha :p
<Sonny> Wrek how's the Viking pony comming along?
<applejack`> nothinng...
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bronysith: Damn right she does!
<Wrek> 05Sonny: havent continuedo n it today
<Sonny> ok
<SafariMonkey> Bronysith: It seems to me that 4 of he mane 6 have their own songs: All but Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash
<Bronysith> SafariMonkey: um
<Bronysith> rainbow dash had her own song
<Bronysith> it was a duet with fluttershy
<Sonny> No she had a duet I think
<Scottish_Brony> that's not her own song, is it?
<applejack`> in which episode?
<Sonny> not really he
<applejack`> with the animals?
<Bronysith> Scottish_Brony: yes it is
<MLP_Brovakiin> applejack`: May the best pet win, that one
<Bronysith> ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Sonny> yup
<applejack`> :)
<SafariMonkey> Bronysith: I guess that conts, she had lead part
<Scottish_Brony> if someone else is singing with them, it's not really their own song
<Bronysith> SafariMonkey: what do you mean you guess? OF COURSE IT COUNTS
<Wrek> 05ok Phase4: i burned memtest to a CD
<Wrek> 05gona boot from it next time i reboot
<Sonny> like "at the gala" that pretty much would include everypony
<Sonny> so yeah
<MaxTheBrony> I hope she get a own song
<Bronysith> Scottish_Brony: it is about her, and it is her song
<alexxm> so whos the better joker nicholson or ledger
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: Good idea
<MaxTheBrony> Ledger Imo
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Sonny> MaxTheBrony: I think if she doesn't the community will make one
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: Not their own song though
<MaxTheBrony> yeah maybe :)
<Jmo> Heath Ledger caught the darker side of the Joker
<Sonny> SafariMonkey: you got a point there
<Bronysith> no shuit
<Sonny> SafariMonkey: Still think they'll do it tough
<Bronysith> Find a pet is a duet of fluttershy and rainbow dash
<Bronysith> they share it
<Bronysith> it is THEIR song
<Bronysith> their own song
<Sonny> ye but it isn't about them is it?
<Sonny> It's about the pet for Rainbow dash
*Bronysith facehoof
<SafariMonkey> Bronysith: By that logic, yu could say applejack shared in at the Gala
<Bronysith> Sonny: it is about rainbow dash
<Sonny> yup
<Bronysith> Sonny: the song is about rainbow dash finding a pet
<Sonny> Bronysith: yes her pet that is
<Sonny> indeed
<Bronysith> so it is about rainbow dash
<Sonny> about a thing she does, not who she is or somthing personal
<Sonny> wich I think can't be included as 'the song of Rainbow Dash'
<MLP_Brovakiin> They all had their own verses in 'at the gala' but that doesn't count as a whoel song
<AdamTheDuck> Apparently you fail Phase4 :D
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, that seems to be the general consensu
<Phase4> 00,02consessus';
<Phase4> 00,02i cant spell
<SafariMonkey> MLP_Brovakiin: I was saying that
<Phase4> 00,02applejack`, dont use me tl learn how to spell
<Bronysith> by that logic Sonny then cheerliee has had her own song before applejack
<Sonny> did she sing?
<Bronysith> nope
<Sonny> oh god
<Bronysith> but the song is about her so she it is her song
<Bronysith> LOGIC!
<Sonny> well then it's her song
<Sonny> send me a link :p
<applejack`> what Phase4 ?
<Sonny> (private)
<applejack`> me?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Sonny> nono Bronysith
<Bronysith> i need to set some shit on fire
<MLP_Brovakiin> SafariMonkey: Sorry I was just AFK for a couple of seconds and didn't see you say that
<Bronysith> Wrek: any ideas on what i can set fire to?
<SafariMonkey> MLP_Brovakiin: It's fine. :)

<Random> max how do you do that?
<AdamTheDuck> I still have no idea what swag means :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> Also guys please i asked this already 4 times,no one knows what the b Movie is ? :|
<MLP_Brovakiin> Its a pun :D
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: the correct term is stolen loot
<MaxTheBrony> Random write /me and then waht you want to say
*PillowPoni wiggles from under MaxTheBrony and Jmo
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: the wrong term is sex appeal
<Random> oh k
<MasterChief> Bronysith : Go back and rip the poster off, spray it with deodorant and burn it in front of 5th grade
*Random test
<MLP_Brovakiin> Notlob is the best town :D
<Eulshy> this is a cool surf map
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, I've only heard it in crush kill destroy sway and in the phrase "ponyswag"
<Bronysith> MasterChief: the fact that little kids use the term SWAG pisses me off, little kids shouldnt be saying "I HAVE SEX APPEAL" thats how they get molestered
<Random> finland is the best meme almost:D
<Sergio_Scriptor> Bronysith: im prety sure they dont know what swag means :P
<MasterChief> Bronysith : "it's trendy nowadays". But in reality this is a method of making all kids "like" the same terms, beliefs and ideas.

*OohShiny sings along
<Twilight_Sparkle[NLR> i love this song, so cute <3

<Axel_Dash> daww fily twi

<MLP_Brovakiin> pony_1334: Get headphones

<Java> Your dad don't allow youto pony?
<OohShiny> daw
<rdibp> Sumica: /)
<JESmith71> pony_1334: Why not put in headphones so you can hear the audio?
<Ninjazz> Any filly is pretty damn adorable.
<Java> oh well
<pony_1334> I don't have headphones.
<Fat> O swag were hosting the Royal wedding again! :D
<XylemTube> Sumica: suddenly it feel like South Park. Waiting for the terrence and philip trailer
<AlienWarhead> :)
<JESmith71> That way you can watch the stream without him knowing
<PillowPoni|Phone> How are you banned from ponies?
<Ninjazz> But Twi has the priviledge of hopping around with her BBBFF. Which is pretty damn adorable.
<Noob709> Oh Shines, you fruit!
<JESmith71> Oh
<OohShiny> yeah sure, never had a single fight
<Lilly_Marley> i hear "fly okay"
<Sergio_Scriptor> i bet 50 bits in how we are not going to get any sort of revelation about S3 when the royal wedding part 2 ends :) anyone wants to counter-bet me ? :P
<Tailsy> this is why Friendship is magic is the most awesome kids tv show ever.
<rdibp> all backround fillys look the same in this show
<flutteryay> :'( my brother cried when i showed this to him i did to
<Sumica> 00,10she missed him so much she forgot about him due to the emotonal trama
<Kandarihu> If you're really against shows being supported by advertising, I hope you don't mind paying upwards of $500 a month for your cable bill, with U.K.-style licensing fees for broadcast TV.
<Bronysith> this is easily the best song of the finale
<Pinkapie> i dont think we will get any info either
<Safari|phone> bye BronyInstrumental
<OohShiny> :(
<CountDoofus> I haz no big bro :'(
*Ninjazz harmonizes.
<Jijonbreaker> All of the 3 S2 finale songs are good in their own way.
<OohShiny> I haz big sis
<rdibp> flutteryay: cried because of the song or cried because of its meaning?
<pony_1334> Because in the element of Applejack, he thinks it is gay and inappropriate.
<MLP_Brovakiin> I find allof the mane 6 fillys adorable apart from fluttershy, her legs are to long for some reason :/
<rdibp> :'(
<JT> nah This day Aria is better

<Pinkapie> everytime i see somebody say they hated an episode i feel like it's a sin if i do like it
<NullRadix> Kandarihu: I remember reading that cable TV was originally advertised with the lack of ads. Ads were added later
<flutteryay> cried because it reminds me of my brother who is GONE i cant see him anymore
<Tailsy> the way twilights back leg rotates in the end of that song.
<AlienWarhead> Java I hope she has a family
<rdibp> bff= brony friends forever

<Ninjazz> Kids don't know how to keep their eyes closed.
<Axel_Dash> who is the dance pony?
<Sergio_Scriptor> TUB LIGHT
<OohShiny> DocSane: she can teleport through rock, but one of the first laws of teleports is to think of the place where you want to go, and materialize on your mind
<FlaschenJoe11> I lived through that. It hardens the kids to pain!!
<Gunthler> "slip" it on >>
<Sergio_Scriptor> Axel_Dash: sumica's OC :)

<Ninjazz> Hey, SB.
<Wirisme> I see :|
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello SuperBrony64 :)
<Wrek> 05and i see no reason to read it
<YourLittleDashie> Wrek: Sweet Apple Masacre isn't that bad. Honestly, it's just overloading the reader with violence with no corralation
<Wirisme> Me neither
<Wrek> 05YourLittleDashie: that is my point
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai :3
<PinkieSpice> why are we watching this?
<Wrek> 05theres no reason to read it
<Sumica> 00,10YourLittleDashie, that is the defenition of bad
<Wrek> 05cause its jsut that
<PinkieSpice> Hey super. :D
<Kandarihu> I see. So the Starship Troopers comparison is purely logistical.
<MLP_Brovakiin> PinkieSpice: Why not?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Nah, she's just in the next county. Forty minute trip on the interstate.
<YourLittleDashie> Wrek: I'm just bored :|
<Kandarihu> That's a relief.
<YourLittleDashie> Sumica: LOL
<DerpyMuffins> We watching an MLG game?
<PinkieSpice> not a fan of starcraft
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: ah, a little less than a visit trip to my grandma
<YourLittleDashie> Apparently, there is a fanfic that is truly terrible: Momma Fluttershy
<Sumica> 00,10DerpyMuffins, you do know what MLG is right?
<DerpyMuffins> Yea why?
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: logistical?
<Jmo> Dat SuperBrony64.
<PinkieSpice> I have no idea what MLG stands for
<MLP_Brovakiin> YourLittleDashie: I would rather sit in perfect silence being exetremely bored then read that
<Sumica> 00,10MLG Game, think about that
<SuperBrony64> 11,02YourLittleDashie: Sounds like what the remake of Halloween did.
<PinkieSpice> except for my little game
<YourLittleDashie> MLP_Brovakiin: LOL
<JRP> SuperBrony64: pm
<YourLittleDashie> I actually wrote a grimdark fanfic... and it sucks
<CrimsonPhoenix> YourLittleDashie, Terrible how?
<YourLittleDashie> CrimsonPhoenix: IDK
<MadSurge> YourLittleDashie: try to rework it into a parody of grimdark :D
<Ninjazz> Oh wait. Momma Flutteshy. Diaper fic.
<YourLittleDashie> Ninjazz: Like Pattycakes?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: Eww pony poo
<Ninjazz> YourLittleDashie, Yeah?
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Dark, Mature, Pregnant Fluttershy
<Wirisme> I heard a description of CC, it just made me feel really sorry for RD
<Ninjazz> Ooooh.
<CrimsonPhoenix> meh

<Wrek> 05CrimsonPhoenix: it took the original starcraft ages and many patches to become as balanced as it is today. personalyl i enjoy sc2's competitive play alot more myself. the originals contains a lot of nostalgia sure. as for singleplayer i enjoyed sc's more. mainly cause you got it all at once. now they split it up too much and made it dull for the singplelayers.
<Gold_Demona> And the fact that they're taking so long to get the expansions out doesn't help. =/
<Wrek> 05dat silence i caused

<Jmo> My interest in HoTS died a few months ago. ;~;
<Obsidian> Hello DaringDerpy
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hey DaringDerpy

<Lil_B> I wanted to make a "Zombie" CD to listen too in my Car, so far I have 7 Songs from L4D2, but there still is so much space left on the Disc... what to put on?
<SpeedyBolt> So what is the point of this game?
<cachi01|phone> you thought i was going to murder someone.didnt u bronystate
<SpeedyBolt> Put Winter Wrap Up on it, and troll everybody that you drive by.
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: "There's a Zombie on the Lawn" from Plants vs. Zombies
<cachi01|phone> Liñ_B you should add the CoD zombies soundtrack
<cachi01|phone> Liñ_B*
<cachi01|phone> Lil*
<Eli> cachi01|phone: actually, no. murder using a knife is outdated
<cachi01|phone> Fuuuu
<Lil_B> good Idea, but I'm more going towards the "Feeling" of Zombie Songs
<cachi01|phone> Lil_B the COD zombies soundtrack is pretty good
<cachi01|phone> 115 feels like a zombie song
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone yes XD I saw it the first time you wrote it XD, I'm gonna check it out
<cachi01|phone> DO IT!
<Lil_B> a Pony CD... would be cool too XD
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: I have a pony CD. I listen to it quite often. :D
<cachi01|phone> Theres a site with all the brony music but i forgot its name
<Lil_B> the Driver I drove to galaCon with had 2 CDs of bronie Songs XD
<Eli> Ponies47: watcha doing? wanna play a round of TF?
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone eqbeats?
<cachi01|phone> Yeah i think
<Ponies47> Eli: TF2? Regular or MvM?
<Eli> Ponies47: regular?
<Ponies47> Eli: Just with red and blu team.
<Ponies47> Eli: No robots
<Lil_B> I guess I could also look into the HL and Portal Soundtrack, some Songs may fit as well
<Lil_B> silly Ponies47 such a mode doesn't exist anymore :P
<Eli> Ponies47: i know what regular means :) that questionmark was added due to insecurity and to ask what you would like
<Eli> Ponies47: never played MvM before...
<Ponies47> Lil_B: Oh it still does
<Eli> Ponies47: i just prefer PvP
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: HL2 has a pretty good soundtrack. As does Portal 2. Good ambient music. =)
<Ponies47> Eli: We can do PvP. :3
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona yes, and good Guy Valve released the fully Portal 2 OST as a Free Download :)
<Eli> ok
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: Yes! I love it. ^^
<cachi01|phone> Lil_B really? Awesome!
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona I think my fav is Cara Mia
<Eli> Lil_B: really? so i didn't have to download it illegally?
<Lil_B> Eli yes XD
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: Yesh. That one's right up there for me. I can't really pick a favorite, though. I also love Robots FTW. That one's just fun. :3
<Lil_B> also, the TF2 Soundtrack is also fully tagged as MP3 in teh TF2 Music Folder XD
<Jmo> Allegr0~
<Gold_Demona> Eli: lol, I got it illegally too by ripping it right out of the game. Then the fre soundtrack came out. XD

<DoctoDoctorWho> flutter_spin: the picnic gathering?
<flutter_spin> ^^
<flutter_spin> twisted tale
<Cades> anything new?
<Kandarihu> There was some controversy over the marines in Halo looking like Samus Aran. It got to the point where Retro Studios designed the story of Metroid Prime 2 around a bunch of similarly designed Galactic Federation Troopers who crashed their ship on an alien planet and then proceeded to die HORRIBLY before Samus arrived.
<Daygon> hi guyd
<Daygon> guys*
<Obsidian> Hello Daygon
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kandarihu: Metroid Other M?
