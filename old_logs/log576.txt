<Liokin> Meanwhile: Sucome to your attack lover and give me your OC image *tries jedi mind trick hand manuever thing*
<Meanwhile> Liokin: This isn't the OC you're looking for.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: I also have the Illustrator file, but it's in CS5 and I don't know if you have an older or the new version that came out.
<Bronysith> Liokin: you're doing it wrong
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Newer.

<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: So you have 6? Well you can open it but I don't know if you can actually work on it per se, but you can get the color scheme from it.
<Meanwhile> shana: Who knows.
<Chrysalis> fthats female
<banarsss> shana: It's female
<Meanwhile> Body type'd suggest it's female but I 'aint about to go check.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: That was the plan -lol
<shana> Meanwhile: I don't know who knows, that's why I am asking
<banarsss> shana: Look at the hips, they're pretty wide
<Kandarihu> shana, in MLP universe, female is default.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: http://attackwithhugs.deviantart.com/#/d574z54 This is the one I'm going for, and that's the color scheme of her/it/me

<Liokin> Shoo bee doo! =D
<Obsidian> Good evening everypony
<alexxm> i was not expecting this
<Alfopony> ^
<alexxm> hey Obsidian how you doing
<red_ony> I think they should at least reference seaponies in s3 :D
<banarsss> I was expecting this
<Liokin> Celestia I love my ringtone XD
<AttacktheAndalite> IT'S BACON AND APPLEJACK
<sub06905> well we should know this is Sumica's sign off video
<Liokin> Obsidian: Sup bro /)
<AttacktheAndalite> Evening, Obsidian
<Obsidian> alexxm: Not bad
<banarsss> Listen to that AUTHENTIC southern Accent.
<WhiteamenaDianeEgg> My house just got blasted with seaponies at 00:32am
<Kandarihu> I really don't want Sea Ponies in FiM. But so many fans are probably asking for it.
<String_Shredder> It's Bacon and Applejacks! (part of your balanced breakfast)
<Meanwhile> Bacon and Applejack.
<Obsidian> Liokin: (\
<Alfopony> cal on the sea ponies
*sub06905 wonders who next streamer will be
<AttacktheAndalite> String_Shredder: Bacon, Applejack and silly filles :3
<alexxm> why were they in the water in the first place
<Kandarihu> MEGAN guys! Friggin' MEGAN! It doesn't even sound like they're saying bacon
<banarsss> Why does Megan look like a cosplay version of Apple Jack?
<sub06905> Bacon and Applejack :P
<Syn_Virtu> so much laggggg
<AttacktheAndalite> Hey guys, the lost episode of the buffer show is on
<shana> who drew the vlc pony picture?
<MadSurge> banarsss: because G4 Applejack is basically ponified Megan :D
<sub06905> ^
<banarsss> MadSurge: Time to write some fan fic.
<Kandarihu> Does Megan run an apple orchard?
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: no, but she was a farmer
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: But yeah, it's up to him if he wants to be shipped. I'd rather not have a cinderblock to the head
<banarsss> Megan owns a truck though
<banarsss> good enuff.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: -lol well to be honest you should pick your ship.
<Kandarihu> Well, even if she doesn't, that's an interesting take on Applejack's design and an idea that they might've written around Marvel's trademark.
<Alfopony> curse u buffer
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Find your very special somepony gimme his picture
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: And you and him will do this *pause for dramatic effect* SHIP
<banarsss> Liokin: A brony dating a non-brony is like a Christian dating an atheist
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: It's on my DeviantArt. And he's a brony, too.
<shana> found it http://parallaxmlp.deviantart.com/art/My-Little-VLC-306123193
<Liokin> banarsss: A fine point you make sir. But as you can see attack's very special somepony is a brony.
<Chrysalis> i love that chrome OC thats linked on that page
<Liokin> banarsss: Therfore your logic has failed :3
<banarsss> Liokin: Oh. *puts pitchfork down*
<banarsss> Alright then.
<MadSurge> Okay guys, going to bed. Goodnight, see you tomorrow!
<banarsss> BYE SURGE
<AttacktheAndalite> banarsss: Why did you get the pitchfork?
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Let me have that link to your DA madame.
<banarsss> CALL ME maybe?
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, MadSurge
<NullRadix> Rest well MadSurge
<alexxm> bye MadSurge
<Liokin> MadSurge: Later bro /)
<banarsss> AttacktheAndalite: Because. I love pitch forks
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: http://attackwithhugs.deviantart.com
<banarsss> *Eats a giant stack of pancakes with pitchfork*
<Chrysalis> you guys seen tombstones new vid?
<Chrysalis> a song for Colgate
<banarsss> AttacktheAndalite: I think you need more pancakes yourself.
<banarsss> AttacktheAndalite: Pancakes make the world go round
<AttacktheAndalite> banarsss: I love pancakes~
<banarsss> AttacktheAndalite: I love pitch forks
<Eulshy> cone
<alexxm> Chrysalis is it good
<Bronysith> no stream....
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: -lol! Nice bf..
<AttacktheAndalite> banarsss: But you rarely need to bring one out unless it's an angry mob tie
<banarsss> AttacktheAndalite: Yeah
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: He reminds me of a friend I use to have.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: ^^ He was nervous about telling me he was a brony.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Not sure what ever happened to him. He kmoved one day. :/
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Aww :( I hope you guys still keep in contact
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Why? Im not ashamed to say im a brony. Im 6'5, black, and have a vioce that was gifted wit teh powah of a bass canon. -lol And although I am no monster. They dont know that....
<banarsss> Liokin: My friend told me he couldn't hang out with a dude who watches a little girl's show. And so I stopped speaking with him.
<Liokin> banarsss: IMO smart move on your part. If somepony cant except you how you are. Get rid of em'
<banarsss> Yeah
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Mmm bass cannon. But yes, he was nervous because he didn't know that I'm a brony. So when I told him I was all "I'm a brony too!" and it all fell into place from there~
<Malmortius> Its just buffering for me :(
<banarsss> Malmortius: LOL it's playing just fine for me
<banarsss> Malmortius: You're missing the video maaan
<shana> Malmortius: there is no stream at the moment
<Meanwhile> Everyday ahm bufferin
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: -lol yes bass canon >:3 I love how I appear. Cause Nopony ever expects me to be a brony. No pony ever would. -lol So I get to troll by nature :3
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: And D'awwww that is such a sweet story ~Sweetie Belle
<banarsss> Liokin: why is that Liokin?
<Liokin> banarsss: Why is what?
<banarsss> Liokin: Nobody expects you to be a brony. I think most average people don't expect men to be bronies
<banarsss> Especially grown men
<Chrysalis> suddenly so quiet
<Liokin> banarsss: I practically ooze masculinety. I love a challenege. IN FACT I have broken a guys hand arm wrestling. So the idea of me cuddling a Twi Plushie at night is a shocker to most.
<banarsss> Liokin: Ohhh XD. like the world's manliest brony
<Liokin> banarsss: :3
<banarsss> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNryNfvcQlY
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: His friends and family know. Well his sister does becase he's ordering 2 pony shirts for me and one of his friends is a brony as well so awesoome. I have a friend that I recently welcomed into the herd
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Sadly I haz no other bronys were I am. I dont mind though. I have you all on bronystate and thats enough.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Also what shirt??? I have the Twi one and A fluttershy and I want a DJ-pon3 but I have to find one.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: And that's all that matters! Where are you located, anyways?
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: The armpit of the world.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: alabama -lol
<Liokin> montgomery to be exact.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: One of them is a derpy shirt and I think the other one is Pinkie with a cupcake on her head.
<Eulshy> bored
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Aaaah. I live in South Carolina~
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Must have derpy shirt....
<oni_link> That feeling when you fall asleep wit your laptop on o.o
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: -lol well you will or probably already have seen me.
<oni_link> *with
<banarsss> Liokin: I'm pretty sure California is the arm pit of the world.
<oni_link> banarsss: What makes you say that?
<banarsss> Lol
<RAWRity> http://i.imgur.com/tIsc5.jpg
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: I go to parts of south california at times for my work.
<banarsss> It's california man
<banarsss> RAWRity: I love NEIL GAIMAN
<oni_link> banarsss: aannd?
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Which parts? I live in Columbia and Columbia is a wide area of the Midlands
<SirGanjalf> is stream off?
<banarsss> oni_link: Do you live there?
<Liokin> RAWRity: Nice. Now show me your sword! =D
<oni_link> banarsss: eeyup
<RAWRity> Liokin: later
<banarsss> oni_link: *takes hat off* *gives it to you* *Strolls away in my old chap suit*
<Liokin> -lol Everywhere I've been to columbia. IN FACT I will be in colombia in about....
<SirGanjalf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvUE77nTYfQ old but good
<oni_link> banarsss: what just happened? I got a hat at least. :D
<Liokin> RAWRity: Then I shall wait.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Ill be in colombia again in 2 weeks for metal work.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Whenn? Oh and SC is the armpit of ther world
<banarsss> oni_link: Hweh
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Nice :3
<banarsss> SirGanjalf: Valve needs Meet the Announcer!!
<oni_link> AttacktheAndalite: I think Nevada comes close :P
<RAWRity> the other thing I got today was this: http://i.imgur.com/0x6bE.jpg
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm
<AttacktheAndalite> oni_link: I think SC is. We're the laughingstock of the country.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: -lol i'll only be there for a few days but you'll no me if you see me. If you think its me run up to me and ask to see my shirt. I will be wearing fluttershy or twi :3
<AttacktheAndalite> AttacktheAndalite: Which part of Columbia and which days? I don't go out much except for classes and those are a t 6pm.
<oni_link> AttacktheAndalite: My condoloences
<oni_link> Im just making sure here but its buffer time right?
<SirGanjalf> banarsss: And miss Pauling and Saxton Hale. Hell, since they've made "Meet the Sandvich", they can as well made "Meet the..." of any weapon.
<shana> RAWRity: is that the dvd boxset?
<banarsss> SirGanjalf: YES
<AttacktheAndalite> oni_link: Yep. That chick who was Miss South Carolina for that pagent who answered that question on why people should read maps. Or was it why should people learn geography
<oni_link> AttacktheAndalite: yikes, almost forgot about that :s
<banarsss> SirGanjalf: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=D4YNrzTWyzY&NR=1
<AttacktheAndalite> oni_link: I don't think anyone could, especially the time it happened.
<Kandarihu> It would be awesome if Valve decided to bring back the modes related to civilians, announcing it all with a surprise release of a Meet the Civilian video.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Not sure -lol. Once they fly us out there we split up and work on several different things in several different locations. thats why I said you've probably already seen me randomly without knowing who I was. :3
<oni_link> AttacktheAndalite: I mean I wouldn't have remembered if you hadn't brought it up. We have tons of airheads here in California too. I think theres people like that anywhere though
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Its not like we could hang out or anything. After all I am going to be on the clock but if you should see me gimme a bro hoof -lol
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: I don't go out much, and I definitely don't go downtown much either. Were you at NashiCon sometime in April this year?
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: I shall if I do
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Sadly no. But I wll be at BUCK and a few other brony conventions coming up.
<Bronysith> all i see is Liokin and AttacktheAndalite
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Sweeeeet. RoundCoun is next month and there's going to bronies there, I know for a fact
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Well whenever I touch down I'll use my laptop and drop you a line on bronystate telling you were I am if you would like to come and see me -lol or if you'd like to sit and chat Id be more than happy to buy lunch for you.
<oni_link> le wild Bronysith appeared! FUUUUUUU, my box is full
<sub06905> dat singing announcer :D
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Sounds interesting i'll have to check in on it.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: You'd best hurry though. I'm sure pre-reg is over by now.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: I'll get on it asap.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: I know someone you might know.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Do you know "Jaxblade?"
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Um...I'm afraid I don't
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: One sec.
<Firelight> no one is streaming ATM?

<banarsss> Liokin: NICE
<Firelight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys8gg-NKdD0
<alexxm> nope no stream
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: I saw that part of the stream when it wasn't lagging.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: -lol I was there at brony con with him.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: I wasnt a celeb like him though.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD~ All my envyyy
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: -lmao atleast thats what he calls himself.
<alexxm> so when is season 3 coming out i figured it would be september
<Firelight> alexxm: Yeah it is.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Well he sent a call out for black bronys
<Firelight> alessm: First it was going to be in august.
<alexxm> thanks Firelight
<Firelight> Alexxm*
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: And I answered and he invited me and quite a few other black bronys to go with him.
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: You should come with us next time -lol
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Sweeet. If I had the money and didn't have school I would have gona
<banarsss> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP8Wmw0UpBg
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Noo no no He was a special guest we got in free cause we were with him -lol
<Firelight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ Oh my gos watch this video! <3
<oni_link> The way Jaxblade got into the show is just like me :D I was like alright, just a few more. Then I saw them all lol
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: School is important though. :3
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Sweet but I still had school and I'm not sure if my parents would have let me go
<banarsss> Liokin: Is it for blacks only?
<Liokin> banarsss: -lol no of course not.
<banarsss> Liokin: Oh
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Yeah I hear ya'
<oni_link> Firelight: I love those BlackGryph0n vids :)
<Firelight> oni_link: I know right? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wblE8YYLyQ0&feature=relmfu
<banarsss> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9-N16CkNs&feature=relmfu
<Liokin> banarsss: But that specific call out was for black bronys because its kind of hard for some black bronys to come out of the dark and admit there fandom.
<banarsss> Liokin: Oh, cause of stereotypes.
<Obsidian> Well I need to get going. Til nextime everypony.
<Liokin> banarsss: Yes and no.
<alexxm> bye Obsidian
<AttacktheAndalite> Bye Obsidian
<alexxm> so Liokin what games do you have on steam

<oni_link> Firelight: the one that started it all but i think that the Fluttershy one is my favorite :)
<Liokin> alexxm: Just TF2 on this specific PC
<Firelight> So wait.. Tara Strong is the voice of Poof from Fairly odd Parents? Hm.

<Liokin> banarsss: So they pick on us and what not for being different. Say that we pain ourselfves and call us gay and what not.
<Liokin> paint*
<alexxm> Liokin just ignore them thats what i do anyways
<Liokin> banarsss: It oesnt phase me personally. But for other more meek black bronys it kills them on the inside.
<Liokin> banarsss: And the point of the trip was to show them that they are not alone.
<Quick_Thinker> no stream? also hi everypony :)
<Liokin> banarsss: And Id say it was a pretty succesful trip -lol
<alexxm> hey Quick_Thinker how've you been

<Reikim> Boiled down to "twist and try not to hit something important"
<Kandarihu> There we go
<oni_link> oh its its stretched to fit now o,o
<Meanwhile> All I learned in martial arts is 'just hit them with a chair it's faster'.
<Firelight> \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Getting DP to work on this laptop involves not straining my PC.
<Calcos323> That ping's gonna get annoying
<Chuck> Wait 41 seconds for LOVE ME, or i maybe counted wrong.
<Petrified_Discord> I DO appreciate things that run and look better :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know how to get DP to work.

<Firelight> Sorry about that.
<Meanwhile> Personally I think martial arts training is a bit pointless without contact sparring.
<Vordox> AHAHAHA <3 THOSE crazy but lovable japanese people
<Vordox> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4824788_460s_v2.jpg
<Reikim> I learned a bunch of mostly-useless kicks. It was good for impressing people, though, until I lost all flexibilit.
<Reikim> *flexibility
<Kandarihu> Chuck, it;s the streamer's ping sound
<Reikim> Hear hear.
<Chuck> Kandarihu I know you egghead.
<Reikim> Well. It's useless for combat.
<Kandarihu> Sorry
<Meanwhile> Finally someone who gets that.
<oni_link> Vordox: ohhh man wtf? :D
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> ...
<Reikim> Martial arts training is really useful as a) an emotional outlet, and b) teaching kids discipline.
<Calcos323> FUCK
<Petrified_Discord> Streamchat
<Firelight> Be Right back.
<Meanwhile> Aye, but for practical defense it's pretty shocking.
<Firelight> Firelight is now AFK.
<Reikim> Useless.
<ponibas> dat mod chat
<Reikim> Might as well invest in better life insurance, really.
<Meanwhile> Because let's face it, no one was ever mugged by a guy in a predictable stance who made sure you were ready first.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You nosy-ass people.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p

<Meanwhile> The best defense you can learn is running.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that is nittany ping ?
<Kandarihu> It's looking unusually pixellated. Is it to be expected?
<Meanwhile> That is.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope I win that motherboard.

<Liokin> Nittany_Discord: Impressive sir.
<banarsss> Dark92Enigma: What n WORD?

<banarsss> Dark92Enigma: oHHHH babyyyyy
<Kandarihu> I have to say. That ping sound is speaking over whatever audio you're playing. It's way too obtrusive. And I'm not the only one who has a problem with it.
*Liokin loves Nittany_Discord
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Wth
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least the underflows are funny.

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: a bit pixellated, but okay :)
<Meanwhile> So flip it a lot.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Nittany_Discord: yeah, maybe a bit lowish framerate
<Chrysalis> its a little pixelated but otherwise fine
<Chrysalis> the pings a little distracting
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have FMLE settings set to low.
<Dark92Enigma> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: somepony else confused you with me (or is it vice-versa?) and tried to tell me (or you) what does the ''n'' word mean. that's what the hell is happening

<Spell-of-Gaming> What's a retsoup? Retarded soup?
*Spell-of-Gaming is not refering to the person. :3

<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: Apparntly everyone here isnt fond of Retsuprae
<Eulshy> Go luigi
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cause they critic let's play in a harsh way
<Eulshy> Luigi is the second best
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> Luigi numba-one
<CrimsonPhoenix> keyword being harsh

<Spell-of-Gaming> Nittany_Discord: Can you stream that... blend webshow thingy
<Meanwhile> A couple of guys mocking bad let's play's. Apparently.
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: Exactly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spell-of-Gaming: Will it Blend?

<Noob709> Crimson: That's all they do when it's a sordid bad lets play in general.
*Ryunosuke glomps Luna
<Kencolt> Somehow I suspect the guys ripping on this couldn't get nearly as far.
<Meanwhile> I expect they could do it in a much more enthusiastic, amusing manner though.
<oni_link> Kencolt: I dont think they say these things without reason
<BlazeAngel> Nittany_Discord: What if he tryed to blend a Fluttershy figurine, and he says "Will it blend?" Then Fluttershy rises from the ashes and he says "Nope."?
*Luna 07,01is glomped
<ekips> dafuq are we watching? :o
<Spell-of-Gaming> A Let's Play is different from a speedrun

<Firelight> Yeah.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He said Rainbow Dash.
<oni_link> Whoa

<Kandarihu> Alright. probably the only criticism I agree with is about the speedrunning.
<Noob709> ekips: You have no permission to do the math.
<Meanwhile> I thought he said "bash" personally.

<Ryunosuke> hows you doing Luna?
<Firelight> Wow.. I called it first.. I WIN
<Reikim> Meanwhile, how do I deal with a co-author who can't write that doesn't involve self-harm?
<Luna> 07,01busy as always Ryunosuke, how are you?
<Firelight> That.. Is.. Amazing.
<Ryunosuke> good good :)
<Meanwhile> Other people-harm?
<Noob709> Firelight: You're killing your audio by the chokehold. Are you alright?
<owlicious> Luna: do you like bananas?

<TheBelgianNotBelgian> viva lo pc
<MASF123> ...nah I ment now.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I would've liked the XBOX if I did have any interest in it.
<Dumorimasoddaa> All teleports, knockdowns and attacks that spike on the knockdowned
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01PC gaming is my future.
<sub06905> MASF123: what game?
<Dumorimasoddaa> Oh and my teleports knock you down
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless I buy the Android box.
<Meanwhile> Does your health pot cause knockdown as well?
<MASF123> ...i don't know just pick something
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not buying a PS4 or 720,
<oni_link> Nittany_Discord: wat??
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: pc gamer for life
<Dumorimasoddaa> Nope no HP pots
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: or wiiu
<Trollberry> NEWS FLASH! Vinyl doesn't always play dubstep and electronic music! she plays other music. she's a DJ so she doesnt always really make the music
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: no buying wiiu for you
<Meanwhile> All the LoL stuns last for like, 1.5 seconds because the damage to health ratio is preposterous.
<oni_link> Bronysith: WiiU :)
<Bronysith> oni_link: no!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01WII U is possible.
<MASF123> I have a feeling the Wii U may have everyone I know on it.
<sub06905> pc, xbox, sony, nintendo <3
<Trollberry> Rise against is the stuff!
<Bronysith> PC PC PC PC, super nintendo, nes, n64, ps2, ps1
<Bronysith> but anywho
<Trollberry> this aint rise against tho
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's Tele to, causes knock down, attack that works only on those knocked down activates next chain a knock down attack, another on knockdown hit
<Trollberry> this is Disturbed
<Quick_Thinker> Wii U im only getting becuase of ZombiU but hey i love nintendo
<Bronysith> some yaboh at my school said this. "Super mario bros is awesome for the super nintendo"
<Trollberry> dont point at meh bro
<Dumorimasoddaa> Big spike based on how many skills I have still on CD
<Bronysith> I said, "Um you mean Nes"
<Quick_Thinker> also ZombiU is in essence a rouge Like
<Bronysith> "Well NES and Super nintendo are same thing"
<Spell-of-Gaming> Bronysith: WHAT. o_o
<oni_link> Bronysith: I like all those things but i getting tired of current gen consoles...halo was the only reason i got an xbox. if they went back to pc releases, i wouldnt even bother
<Dumorimasoddaa> trip wire, tps to an knock downs when target is more than 100m away
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> god why didn't you killed him?
<adasdad> GERMANY
<MASF123> I never was a PC gamer, my 1st console was a NES after that it's been console after console for me.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Then you don't bother chasing when they flee and repeate
<Meanwhile> Boom.

<Quick_Thinker> and i thought it was a normal episode
*Bronysith gently and barely pokes Meanwhile
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A lot of why I don't want to buy the next gen consoles can be summed up by a Jimquisition vid.
<Kandarihu> Oh, I thought this was going to be the pony compilation.
<sub06905> ive seen this video :$
*Meanwhile slaps Bronysith with a cinderblock.

<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: "all we do is, backstab valve, hold out on whole games for dlc later at outragous prices, bribe game reviewers, and act like total dicks to our customers. why do they hate us?"
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's very nasty as a callable spike in a mostly pressure team
<Cypresswolf> Im seeing more games that make you register the darn game as soon as you install it? what is that about?

<Malmortius> If you guys could marry a girl in real life who had the exact same hairstyle and personality as a pony, WHICH WOULD IT BE?
<Dashierulez> no play youtube poop my little porno friendship with benefits.....
<Malmortius> RARITY FTW
<Spell-of-Gaming> adasdad: Actually, they said Origin is Facebook. what.
<Cypresswolf> PC games
<Dken2021> Malmortius idunno, be kinda weird
<WalkerPony89> somuchpony: You're gonna mute your computer?
<oni_link> Malmortius: dont make me choose :(
<somuchpony> no
<Dumorimasoddaa> For killing runners in capture games and picking off lone fighters.
<MASF123> Dat Ass
<oni_link> lol
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's got no stoping power
<Kandarihu> Is there any evidence around that EA is bribing game reviewers?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: we should make a reality show called "gamers strike back"
<WalkerPony89> Malmortius: Fluttershy or Twi. Probably Twi since our personalities are similar
<adasdad> I moved the recycle bin from the part of my desktop marked "rubbish" and reserved it for origin. the only reason i have itr is bf3.
<sub06905> would link a video, but stream is on
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: where we track down EA workers, and beat the shit out of them
<somuchpony> .me is ded
<Dumorimasoddaa> And while I have managed to 1v3 it was pure luck
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: Don't forget "Punish consumers in our war with used games" and "suck dev teams dry"
*somuchpony is ded
<WalkerPony89> Battlefield 4, anyone?
<MASF123> Bronysith, who would fund it? I sure as hell won't.
<oni_link> adasdad: and soon so will i :(
<Cypresswolf> Bought Roller Coaster 3 a couple weeks ago - a bit aged - but it wanted my address among other things - wouldnt let me play if I didnt answer all those damn boxes
<Dumorimasoddaa> 1v2 requires the second to be weak already
<Malmortius> Rarity would be best in real girl form. Dat pale skin and purple hair. MY FAVOURITE COLOUR.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: who is worse. PETA or EA
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, so you're advocating violence?
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> Best RCT is 1
<Bronysith> dumb question
*Luna 07,01revives somuchpony
*kirzstryfe noms on Luna
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: violence isnt the answer, it is the question. the answer is YES
<Dken2021> hai Luna !!
*Luna 07,01hugs Kirz
*Bronysith noms on kirzstryfe whom is nomming on Luna whom is nomming on me
*adasdad roleplays excessively
<oni_link> Malmortius: its a tie between Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash for me
<Luna> 07,01de noms have been trippled!~
<Meanwhile> In LoL you don't 1v2 unless the 2 in question will both die in a hit each.
*MASF123 gives Luna a Phoenix Down
*adasdad gives luna a falcon punch
<MASF123> *It did nothing....*
<tigher1001> a wild flutter rage appeared
<Dumorimasoddaa> More or less the case in GW
*Bronysith huggles Luna
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> or you play mundo
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> twillight is most likely to be gamer
<Meanwhile> The amount of /me in that chunk of chat is too damn high.
<Calcos323> Hey everypony!
<MASF123> Pinkie IS a gamer.
<Meanwhile> Mundo is a bastard.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Or are a fighter/dervish
<cratorkid> and fanfic writer TheBelgianNotBelgian
<oni_link> Calcos323: hi
<Kandarihu> You know, if you were to ask me who is worse between PETA and EA, I'd say PETA is worse. EA at least makes games that are of some value to some people. PETA is just a hate group.
<Dken2021> lali-ho Calcos323
<Dumorimasoddaa> With the right build
<tigher1001> play the video
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yes he is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry for the pause.
<Unnr|Laptop> TheBelgianNotBelgian: I always though RD would be most likely in the Frat-brother playing halo with the bros sort of way
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fixing the audio repeater.
<Dumorimasoddaa> A dervish an 1v3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Been fighting that all night.
<Calcos323> Peta is funneh
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Why laptop?
<Meanwhile> If you go 1v3 on LoL you might as well order your tombstone first.
<WalkerPony89> Kandarihu: PETA also kills animals. EA might be greedy, but at least they don't murder things
<Dumorimasoddaa> Cos your attacks hit up to 3 per swing
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> I'd rather play platformers than Halo XD
<sub06905> lol
<otakon> GET THAT LIST OUT OF HERE!
<Kandarihu> WalkerPony89, yeah. True
<Calcos323> explosions
<Dumorimasoddaa> And you can be super tankie
<Dumorimasoddaa> And just out pressure them
<MASF123> It's fine Nittany_Discord, I enjoy watching Pinkie stare at Aj's ass. :D
<Dumorimasoddaa> Well you might die
<Calcos323> boom
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is there a sound lag??
<oni_link> lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> no
<Dken2021> none at all nItt
<otakon> WalkerPony89: they murder creatively and ingenuity and imagination something the world is much more lacking for than cats and dogs.
<Calcos323> pow
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just on my end then.
<tigher1001> DARP
<Dumorimasoddaa> But you can lock 3 for I'd say a good 10 seconds at least
<tigher1001> DERP
<RainBowJack> your Twilight Sparkle evolveded into a Rapidash
<Dumorimasoddaa> Before you team can help
<sub06905> boom
<Meanwhile> Tanks don't do enough damage at high level for them to go 1v3 with anything bar maybe Fortune Teemo and Zhao at close range.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Dervish was always good for holding people up and making them focus on you
<Kandarihu> I think the audio is a split second behind the video.
<adasdad> atomic piano
<Calcos323> dick
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have to force a sound lag on my end to keep under/overflows from happening.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which cause those stutters.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Yup
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord:
<oni_link> wow
<Dumorimasoddaa> Very nice pressure
<oni_link> lol
<Calcos323> wow
*MASF123 understands not even the slighest of what he's talkng about.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really hope I get that motherboard.
<Kandarihu> Wow. Perfectly timed ping
<Dumorimasoddaa> My old PvP dream team
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile is either do damage or live long enough for your firends to assist
<RustyMeat> Micheal bay ponies?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> poor alistar Forevr CC
<Meanwhile> Unless you're Morde.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Was Dervish, monk, Necro/Mesmer, Assasin
<Dumorimasoddaa> 5man wild card
<Meanwhile> In which case walk in there and soak up everything.
<WalkerPony89> otakon: It isn't to such an extent that I would say that EA is worse than PETA. There are still plenty of creative games coming out nowadays. There's more uncreative crap, but still, EA isn't responsible for a majority of that
<tigher1001> magic.mov plz
<WalkerPony89> CENTER IT NOW

<Bronysith> tigher1001: we dont stream the .mov series here. so please stop
<adasdad> airpuff: I'm pingingyou for no reason!
<otakon> WalkerPony89: they are when they force developers to change their game idea's for the sake of "broadening the demographic".
<MASF123> Yaplap is awesome.
<Calcos323> Nittany_Discord: It would be an injustice if it didn't
<otakon> THE HELL!?

<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, I thought Spike.mov is safe for stream.
<Calcos323> Why'd you skip the drunk guy? That video's funny as shit
<Vordox> Apple.mov is th eborderline "valid" aye XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: That one as well.

<Lunar_Brony> I am calm. I'm wearing a wooden tie.
<Firelight> By everyone.. Again.
<Saturn> 08,01it's not your fault if it's not in the embed; but i can assure you, it's in the topic
<otakon> Saturn: where is it though? I'm looking where is the topic? screenshot please.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01superretroworld: We're not going to ban you, K?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6regardless, there was a major post on the front page for a few days last week otakon
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: http://test.du.cx/pics/sav4vA.png
<superretroworld> k, sorry bout that
<Rain> Saturn, what he means is he thought you said you put what superretroworld said in the topic. that is all
<kirzstryfe> 8,6and superretroworld, wasn't planning a ban, just the warning so it didn't lead to anything else
<Meanwhile> This entire discussion is goofed.
<Lunar_Brony> I'M WEARING A WOODEN TIE!
<berrygreyandbloodyte> isnt that a clop series (i have weird friends(
*MASF123 has no idea. :)
<Saturn> 08,01Rain: what? how does that even...
<otakon> Saturn: you do realize that no one using the embed can't see all that is what I'm saying.
<Unnr> If you want to see the topic in the embed, hover your mouse pointer over the top box
<ZappyTheUnicorn> I have no clue what's going on. :P
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: aye, i see now
<Rain> otakon, type /topic #bronystate
<otakon> yeah, you can see it if you do that
<Meanwhile> Rain: We going to tell everyone who joins the chat that?
<otakon> but how many know to do that offhand?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm going to talk to the admins about changing the chat embed
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> or hovering your mouse over the channel name
<Meanwhile> Inb4 something breaks.
<Saturn> 08,01because this flash client does my freakin' head in
<Saturn> 08,01it's broken, useless, and just... urgh
<otakon> something that causing banning should be first and foremost on that topic off the bat.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: well, it's in the topic
<Quick_Thinker> and thus ends Quick's little chat story of o-meters THANKS FOR READING :)
<Saturn> 08,01but the chat client doesn't display it properly
<Unnr> the lightIRC client is kinda crap, Saturn. the IRSI ajax version is better in many regards, but not as user friendly
<otakon> aye
<kirzstryfe> 8,6otakon, it's in the site rules, and it has been for a very, very long time
<sonicdude558> spi i i i i i i
<kirzstryfe> 8,6now drop it
<Lunar_Brony> I haven't been here 5 minutes and I'm stupidly lost
<ponibas> for people using the site to come into chat, maybe a banner onthe webpage itself.. iun all the theatre rooms
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: aye; i'd quite like to put Iris on
<Taeguk> bonk
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Lunar_Brony: its ok i've been here all day, and i'm lost
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, i think there's already an Iris embed, if one clicks the link
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Well, I need to get to bed. Night everypony.
<Meanwhile> Drop it like it's hot.
<otakon> night ZappyTheUnicorn
<Lunar_Brony> g'night ZappyTheUnicorn
<berrygreyandbloodyte> night
<Meanwhile> Bye ZappyTheUnicorn.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night ZappyTheUnicorn
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, ZappyTheUnicorn
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: if i kick you on lightIRC, you don't see the kick message, right?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6can't use Iris as the default, would cause issues
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<otakon> Saturn: no I see it
<Alpha-Omega> I think this is my least favorite episode
<otakon> Saturn: popup
<Quick_Thinker> still like how i was able to pull off an entire story based on o-meters and heck some people even particapated XD
<ZappyTheUnicorn> See ya'll later hopefully.
<Saturn> 08,01well, i'll look into a better way of doing it...
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yeah, I got that fixed Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<Vinyl_Scratch> You taking all the gramcatter! Lulz
<Lunar_Brony> Can somepony explain WTF everypony is talking about?
<adasdad> SUPER SPEED SCOOTCH IN
<Lunar_Brony> Please?
<oni_link> lol
<Meanwhile> I go to sleep like that.
<berrygreyandbloodyte> dat horrified face
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Lunar_Brony: spoilers
<Vinyl_Scratch> Haha that melody HAVN'T been heard before
<Yahooz> ...you can see channel topic in embedded anyway
<Lunar_Brony> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz DO NOT WANT!!!
<adasdad> rrmrmrmrmrmrrmmrm!
*Saturn 08,01sighs
<Yahooz> something aint right here
<Vinyl_Scratch> Shut up? WTH?!
<Quick_Thinker> Lunar_Brony long story short i made an entire chat story of o-meters like for instance an awesome-o-meter
<Saturn> 08,01okay, i'm going to log in using lightIRC
<Saturn> 08,01and put this to rest
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ok there seems to be a bit of miscommunicaton here
<Alpha-Omega> ha control lightning
<Lunar_Brony> Quick_Thinker okay . . . what about the IRC crap?
<Quick_Thinker> no clue
<hen3ry> This is not canon.
<Vinyl_Scratch> Oh its fanvoiced, well i thougt the voice's was weird.
<Lunar_Brony> /)_(\
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: the whole topic is there when you hover over it
*Lunar_Brony flails his arms around and screams like an idiot
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Saturn: not many ponies know that
<Vinyl_Scratch> CRUSH KILL DESTROY SWAG
<otakon> Saturn: yeah but how many people unfamiliar with lightIRC know to do that?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> welp im going to sleep
<berrygreyandbloodyte> ^
<otakon> night Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Dark92Enigma
<Ponies_Pony> to be fair, not many ponies know they are using IRC when using the light client
<berrygreyandbloodyte> night
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, it's not a very good UI design decision
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Lunar_Brony> sorry Dark92Enigma. Tab-fail
<otakon> Christ if you really want to nip this in the bud make a popup that says "PLEASE READ SITE RULES" for everyone that enters the IRC chat.
<Rain> otakon, wouldnt work for me :3
<hen3ry> it'd certainly promote people using external clients xD
<Vinyl_Scratch> ....
<Vinyl_Scratch> XD
<superretroworld> the fan voices are actually pretty good
<Vinyl_Scratch> ....
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: anyone entering a site should have the good sense to read the rules anyway. our rules are in handy bullet points, so ignorance really isn't a defence.
<Sumica> 00,10cant see the stream with an external cliant
<oni_link> :D
<Quick_Thinker> xd
<Vinyl_Scratch> XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Vinyl_Scratch> LOL?
<Yahooz> Pop out stream should work
<Quick_Thinker> book 1 oh shi
<hen3ry> Sumica: So? Spike theatre and real IRC client ftw xD
<Meanwhile> Saturn: If you have faith that newfoals will read the rules before entering chat, you're gonna have a bad time.
<Dark92Enigma> Lunar_Brony lol at least now you know
<Lunar_Brony> why am I still wearing this wooden tie?
<otakon> Saturn: so someone ignorant about something being an actual spoiler askign about it is subject to a banning?
<Vinyl_Scratch> XD
<Meanwhile> Newfoals can't ruleforce.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Go Celestia.
<Vinyl_Scratch> That made my morning...
<Sumica> 00,10guess you dont know how iframes work then
<AttacktheAndalite> inb4 Meanwhile makes a "Newfoals can't _____" joke
<otakon> iframes?
<superretroworld> otakon: are you against me or something?
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: Beat you to it.
<AttacktheAndalite> Dammit, I was late agaaaain
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: yes, because they should have read the rules.
<otakon> superretroworld: no I'm not.
<Lunar_Brony> I read the rules
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: see that biiig button at the top of the page that says "rules"?
<Yahooz> Saturn: on paper
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Do I need to stream G3 so people can stop arguing?
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord NO.
<adasdad> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<adasdad> lol
<superretroworld> k
<Meanwhile> Saturn: If you have faith that newfoals will read the rules before entering chat, you're gonna have a bad time. What part of that did you miss first time round/
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: YES
*SpadeMagnes[R] flips a table in rage
*Quick_Thinker suddenly a chapter-o-meter COMES FLYING OUT A WINDOW AND INTO Quick's lap RETURN OF THE O-METERS
<Rain> Nittany_Discord, I like g3.. :|c
<oni_link> its time for me to go. good bye and thanks Nittany_Discord for the stream
<kirzstryfe> 8,6considering nothing was actually linked spoiling anything, and nothing entered into the discussion spoiling anything, it's time to drop the subject, BOTH of you
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: well, that's their problem, not mine.
<otakon> Saturn: it doesn't matter if they read the rules or not in this cause. The point is asking about a subject that they DID NOT KNOW was a spoiler and getting banned for askign about it. It's not fair.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> DONT YOU FUCKING DARE
<sub06905> yes Nittany_Discord do ett
<adasdad> NONONONONONONONONO
<AttacktheAndalite> Nittany_Discord: Yes, please. I sense this argument going bad areas
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: any sensible person should.
*Lunar_Brony flails his arms around and screams like an idiot
<hen3ry> doit doit doit
<Derpy123> What is going on?!?!?
<oni_link> Bye everypony
<hen3ry> fire in the hole!
<Lunar_Brony> seeya oni_link
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: DO EET DO EET DO EET
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No problem oni_link
<Yahooz> i agree with kirz, the mods can settle with this issue. it doesnt need to be continued in here
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Pfft. You have too much faith in newfoals. "sensible".
<otakon> bye oni_link take care
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I swear to celestia...
<Dovah> bye oni_link
<AttacktheAndalite> Derpy123: nothing you don't want to get involved in
<AttacktheAndalite> Bye oni_link
<BlazeAngel> I'll pistol whip the next one who says Shenanigans!
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: well then, maybe a ban will instil sense in them.
<otakon> Meanwhile: please stop using the term newfoals, you sound like a hipster or some such.
<Rain> he has a point, Saturn. he didnt /know/ it was a spoiler. he thought it was fan made.
<Derpy123> Can I get a hug, Attack?
<adasdad> shenanigans!
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: first offence is only a 24 hour ban, remember
*AttacktheAndalite hugs derpy132
<Meanwhile> Saturn: More like "scare them away so they never come back"
*Lunar_Brony glomps Derpy123
<Alpha-Omega> But I do love you Fluttershy
<Derpy123> Me d'awws and feels slightly better
<Yahooz> Saturn: typically that leads to ban evades
<sub06905> Nittany_Discord: i demand ponies, g3 ponies
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ahhh i see people don't know when to stop arguing
<Yahooz> :p
<Meanwhile> otakon: Not until you correctly use "your" and "you're" in your sentences.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> is it a full moon tonight? 6_9
<Derpy123> Oh, I just Derped
<Saturn> 08,01we could keep on arguing this all night, but rules is rules
*SpadeMagnes[R] slaps sub06905 with a cinderblock
<Yahooz> *are
<Meanwhile> I have that problem a lot.
<otakon> Considering how MUCH fan content is created, it's sometimes hard to tell what's actually real and what's fan made at times especially in the cases of original animation and music.
<Saturn> 08,01if you don't like it, send us an e-mail.
<sub06905> ow
<otakon> superretroworld: sorry man, you're getting a 24 hour ban.
<Lunar_Brony> Saturn how about we switch topics, then? I'm wearing a wooden tie!
*SpadeMagnes[R] sets Lunar_Brony 's tie on fire
<Saturn> 08,01Lunar_Brony: is it because it already had a knot in it?
<superretroworld> otakon: didnt we already discussed this?
<otakon> ....
<Rain> Saturn, Im not saying that he didnt know that spoilers was against the rules. Im saying he didnt know it was a spoiler. He honestly thought it was fan made.
<Yahooz> This was a warning otakon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i know when to shut up most of the time, it's an useful skill
<Unnr> Saturn: It was a cut above.
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: The Epic Pie Time series is a goo example, though the voices are a dead giveaway. That's all I'm saying in this matter.
<Yahooz> it doesnt go straight to ban
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yeah, please don't feed into it
<Yahooz> as far as i know
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stop arguing, K?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> thta's why i'm talking here in the first place :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No-one's getting banned, K?
<Meanwhile> I know when to stop talking, but when it's debate-like, motormouth.
<MASF123> Let's just start all over again? Pweeze?
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when no one was getting banned?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord do spanis sea ponies

<Vordox> Rainbow Dash is coming, they are just fixing her up
<Meanwhile> Rain: Yeah but it's easier to call happy one Pinkie and Cupcake one Pinkamena, for sake of ease.
<Rain> Nittany_Discord, its because she is nowhere near done.
<otakon> but everyone this calls her Pinkie for short
<adasdad> rain: YOUR LOGIC CANT HJARMME
<Vordox> Thanks for streaming Nittany_Discord
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: likely she's the last to be completed
<Eddmario> I wonder if one of the updates that comes out after it's released will include custom characters...
<Malmortius> Did wrek ever finish his Rarity artwork
<otakon> thanks again Nittany_Discord
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord the pegasi would take the most time mainly because of their feathers
<cratorkid> yea , thnx for the stream Nittany_Discord
<otakon> Malmortius: more than likely yes, he's very fast.
<RAWRity> like how Applejack and Twilight were shown almost completed while Rarity and Pinkie didn't even have walk cycles yet.
<Lunar_Brony> RAWRity her and Fluttershy
<scottish-geeky> thanks for streeming Nittany_Discord
<Lunar_Brony> *or
*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord.
<Rain> ...
<WalkerPony89> I can't wait to see how they'll handle Fluttershy
<Lunar_Brony> Thank you for the always awesome stream Nittany_Discord. Have a good sleep!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry for the sound issues. I fought my audio repeater all night.
<Malmortius> I still dont know where raritys name comes from. I understand where all the rest come from.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01First time I had to use one.
*GabeMoist dusts Nittany_Discord's audio repeater
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord meh, I dont' mind
<Rain> Malmortius, rare jems. :|
<DJPON3> so. hmm...
<otakon> WalkerPony89: she'll fight like that one character from BlazBlue, with a "summon" per se.
<RAWRity> WalkerPony89: inb4 Flutter's stare is gamebreaking OP and she's banned from tournament play
*AttacktheAndalite hugs Nittany_Discord "It's okaay"
<Eddmario> WalkerPony89: Currently, she's OP. Except against herself. Probably gonna end up like the Pokemon trainer in Brawl...
<Malmortius> There hasent been much mention of gems where im up to ;p
<otakon> Malmortius: a rarity is just that, something rare.
<Malmortius> episode 11
<scottish-geeky> Nittany_Discord: dont worry abut the sound the sterm was awesome enways sleep well
<WalkerPony89> otakon: I've never played Blazblue, so I have no idea what you're talking about :P
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Fluttershy is more likely to be planned from tourney's because no one wants to see her get beat on.
<Malmortius> Yes otakon, but what does that have to do with raritys personality. Not that it has to, but it seems all the other names fit their character.
<MASF123> :(
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: I'd beat the hell out of Fluttershy, honestly.
<Lunar_Brony> Malmortius when you say something's a rarity, it's extremely rare and high valued. The term is often used to describe jems
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: agreed.
<otakon> WalkerPony89: well it's hard to explain, but she'll probably have a long range keep away character with long recovery times but high damage attacks.
<otakon> GEMS
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: it's GEMS
<otakon> not jems
*DJPON3 spins in circles :D
<otakon> Jem was a bad cartoon from the 80's
<GabeMoist> otakon, I could care less
<Meanwhile> otakon correcting someones spelling. What alternate universe did I just fall into.
<cratorkid> i plan on playing pinkie most
<Malmortius> I'm not a moron i know what rarity means :(
<Lunar_Brony> otakon YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO USE THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE.
<RAWRity> otakon: but she was truly, truly outrageous
<otakon> Meanwhile: correct GabeMoist
<WalkerPony89> otakon: Sounds like her kind of fighting style. If Fluttershy had to have one, that is
<Meanwhile> GabeMoist: couldn't*
<otakon> Meanwhile: he said "I could care less" XP
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile in the Meanwhileverse
<otakon> XD
<WalkerPony89> Lunar_Brony: It's otakon, he always uses that voice
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|: That place would be horrible.
<Malmortius> For example. rainbow dash, because shes quick and flys! Fluttershy, shes shy. But rarity? Hmm. Because.. she likes gems?
<hen3ry> Ever noticed how all serial killers have three names? If you want your kids not to be serial killers, don't give them a middle name
<Lunar_Brony> WalkerPony89 well in that case, I'll have to use my secret weapon . . .
<Lunar_Brony> The Capitol Accent!
<Meanwhile> hen3ry: I have 2 middle names. ...welp.
<GabeMoist> hen3ry, also, most criminals drink water
<GabeMoist> we should ban water immediately
<hen3ry> Yes! Ban water!
<Rain> otakon, what, can you see into his head? Maybe he can care less. How would you know unless you were some sort of self obsorbed ass that can read minds
<Malmortius> I'm naming my daughter Rarity. Its going to be awesome.
<DJPON3> will the stream continue tonight, or later today? :S im heading to bed if not :)
<otakon> Malmortius: she's a fashion designer whose big thing is using gems in her designs. She has an innate ability to find gems through magic.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i have 2 names and 2 last names ;o
<Meanwhile> T: well get you.
<RAWRity> http://i781.photobucket.com/albums/yy97/Daisy8809/meanwhile_in_belgium.jpg
<Malmortius> Oohh, that explains it otakon. the magic part of it.
<otakon> Rain: no, grammatically "I could care less" is incorrect.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Mfw that linked pinged me.
<otakon> Rain: that is what I was getting on about.
<RAWRity> otakon: not if they're saying the COULD, in fact, care less.
<Lunar_Brony> We flourish evary word we say, and roll any hard "er" sounds. "Happy Hungah Games! And may the Odds be Evah in Youah Favah!"
<Rain> Grammatically, you are being an ass.
<Rain> that is what I was getting on about.
<Malmortius> If you guys HAD to name one of your children after a pony, which would it be?
<scottish-geeky> Lunar_Brony: how are ya lad
<RAWRity> For instance, it's possible for me to care less about this chat, were I inclined to do so.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Luna
<GabeMoist> And the "could care less" discussion begins once again
<hen3ry> Lyra.
<RAWRity> Malmortius: Braeburn
<GabeMoist> Where's dari
<Rain> Malmortius, that is easy, Sparkles Fantastic.
<otakon> Rain: okay why is it when I correct someone I'm a ass, but no one says anything to Meanwhile when he undoubtedly corrects me?
<Meanwhile> GabeMoist: Opening things up massive. With leverage.
<hen3ry> Seems to be the least teasing-potential name in the series so far xD
<WalkerPony89> Malmortius: Mane 6? Because if it is restriced to Mane 6, then I hope to God my kid is a girl
<Malmortius> How about derpy, rain.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Because I'm allowed.
<otakon> Meanwhile: on what grounds and BEING BRITISH DOES NOT COUNT!
<Rain> Because I havent seen Meanwhile do it.
<otakon> Rain: you are blind then
<Meanwhile> otakon: On the grounds that you're always wrong.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: correct Rain
<otakon> he does it at LEAST once a goddamn day whil I'm here.
<Malmortius> So much hostility.
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|: About what.
<AttacktheAndalite> Malmortius: Oh god...uh...
<RAWRity> leave Rain Rain alone, otakon, or I'll tell shizu
<Lunar_Brony> scottish-geeky Oh deah, you sound an awful lot like Haymitch. Let me brighten you up a bit with spectaculah red lips and a matching nail polish. It's all the rave.
<Rain> No, otakon, I just dont spend much time around here, because I start hating everyone.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Rain is rarely looking at the chat.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: she didn't use an apostrophe
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon Meanwhile corrects everyone not only you :p
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|: Didn't see, cba to look.
<Rain> Spectrum_Rush| you can shove it.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: otakon's being mean to Rain Rain
<Malmortius> Stop arguing or ill have to talk about inappropriate things until i get banned.
<Meanwhile> And yeah, it's not just you otakon, it's just you /a lot/
<Spectrum_Rush|> :P
<RAWRity> Malmortius: knock yourself out, hombre
<otakon> Rain: well that sucks but the point is me jabbing fun at GabeMoist being incorrect in his usuage of the english language is nothing to get your knickers in a twis about eh?
<MASF123> OMFG I hate life....
<scottish-geeky> Lunar_Brony: umjust be cus i wera a man skirt (kilt) dosint mean i do lipstick or nialspolish
<cratorkid> oh hey Shizuka
<Spectrum_Rush|> I love you to Rain
<RAWRity> MASF123: don't get mad, get glad.
<scottish-geeky> MASF123: me to
<Malmortius> RAWRity: .. maybe later. I like you guys really :(
<Meanwhile> otakon: usage* twist*
<GabeMoist> otakon, I was more making a joke about when you and dari were arguing over that phrase previously
<otakon> THAT WAS A TYPO
<otakon> GabeMoist: yh and I was wrong then.
<hen3ry> I couldn't care less about people incorrectly saying that they could care less.
<Rain> I do not know you, Spectrum_Rush| and have not once implied that I love you >:|
<RAWRity> otakon: what's this about you putting knickers onto Twist?
<otakon> GabeMoist: I conceded defeat and dammit I'll start using it correctly.
*AttacktheAndalite hides before the chat erupts into total warfare
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: I don't like where this is going.
*otakon drags AttacktheAndalite out
<otakon> YOU'LL BE FINE!
<scottish-geeky> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBKBI7DOLHA
<Rain> also, otakon, I will get my "knickers" in a twist whenever I damn well please.
*Meanwhile clonks otakon with a cinderblock. "Stop capsing"
<Spectrum_Rush|> Rain: you're to serious, lighten up live a little, have fun
<Lunar_Brony> scottish-geeky I wasn't talking about that. At the veahy least, improve youah accent. It doesn't flow veahy well and sounds so rough.
<hen3ry> Remember, last time we let the grammar nazis rule a country, bad things happened.
*DJPON3 asks, "stream is ovah, just chat naow?"
<otakon> Rain: ouch, doesn't it chafe to walk then?
<Starflash> Happy monday everyone~
<otakon> :P
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|: Dude you are poking a tiger with a javelin, shush.
<RAWRity> otakon: leave rain's knickers to his/her own business.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: :(
<otakon> Her RAWRity
<Spectrum_Rush|> i didn't mean too
<Meanwhile> RAWRity is a her now?
<Lunar_Brony> Starflash Oh don't be silly, we 'aven't reached midnight yet.
<Rain> and then my ignore list grew three sizes that day
<AttacktheAndalite> Chat needs more Penn so I'll appropriately place this here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axWsbQhNCs0
<scottish-geeky> Lunar_Brony: cus my accent is fake mah boi
<otakon> no I'm telling RAWRity Rain is a her.
<RAWRity> according to otakon
<Meanwhile> Oh ok.
<hen3ry> yay christmas
<Derpdash> is stream dead?
<otakon> yes
<scottish-geeky> AttacktheAndalite: lol
<Meanwhile> I like Christmas.
<scottish-geeky> Meanwhile: haloween
<otakon> and then Rain ignored me for God know's what.
<Meanwhile> I like Halloween to.
<hen3ry> Halloween is about candy. Christmas is about presents. We need to combine them somehow.
<Meanwhile> otakon: It'd be presumputious to assume she's ignoring you.
<GabeMoist> I'mma go get cereal
<Rain> hadnt gotten to you yet, otakon, but Im working my way there.
<Meanwhile> Told you so.
<otakon> lovely, see?
<Capitol_Accent> AttacktheAndalite that was veahy rude of you to interrupt this friendly conversation with yoah profanitay.
<cratorkid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwrel&NR=1&v=Rai9SiBRv50
<Ryunosuke> hen3ry, actually christmas season starts around halloween anyway? -_-
<Eddmario> hen3ry That has got to be the most idiotic idea I've ever read. LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN GUYS!
<otakon> cratorkid: who is that?
<AttacktheAndalite> Capitol_Accent: One, I didn't say it, Mr. Penn did.
<hen3ry> Ryunosuke: only because of marketing. I'm waiting for it to start on Labor Day, personally.
<Dovah> I think im going to go now: night everypony.
<cratorkid> otakon: no fking clue
<AttacktheAndalite> Capitol_Accent: Two, I sense the chat might end up in flames so...
<Spectrum_Rush|> unless you've already ignored me, I am sorry Rain
<Ryunosuke> hen3ry, why wait, just make it a year round thing :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'd like to celebrate hallowen ... free candy :p too bad in here we only have the "day of the dead" but the food for that one is so good :p
<MASF123> Riiight...so I'll be going now. Not in a good mood. So See you all tomorrow.
<Eddmario> Probably the BEST YouTube comment of all time: http://cheezburger.com/6447562496
<Capitol_Accent> g'night Dovah. And may the odds by evah in youah favah!
*MASF123 leaves
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, MASF123
<hen3ry> oooooh.
<Meanwhile> Halloween is the only time I can creep around bushes at night carrying smoke bombs without seeming out of place.
<RAWRity> http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/528980_392688727447345_1169001288_n.jpg
<scottish-geeky> RAWRity: HA
<scottish-geeky> RAWRity: i see waht u did there
<Eddmario> Meanwhile: Halloween is the only time I can stalk people without getting arrested.
<Capitol_Accent> AttacktheAndalite oh, you should 'ave seen Katniss at the Seventy-Fouath Hungah Games! She is "The Girl On Fiah"
<scottish-geeky> Eddmario: no u just need to be carful
<Eddmario> RAWRity: I don't get it...
<otakon> RAWRity: i hate those plastic tubes
<hen3ry> Halloween is the only time I can stake people without getting... no wait, 2007, I forgot.
<Meanwhile> otakon: it's a series of tubes.
<AttacktheAndalite> Capitol_Accent: Niiice. I need to re-read the books. I only read the first one, though
<otakon> Eddmario: you've never cut the corners of your mouth on those freezie pop tubes before have you?
<Meanwhile> Scissors man, scissors.
<RAWRity> Meh, Hunger Games is okay, though I felt Catching Fire had a big problem of just being padding until we could get to the twist ending...which I saw coming from all the way back in the 5 chapter.
<Eddmario> otakon: Nope, because i'm not an idiot.
<Meanwhile> Hahahahaha
<Meanwhile> That is the best answer.
<Derpdash> Eddmario: What are you talking about, EVERYONE does.
<hen3ry> there is a fine, fine line between genius and idiocy. Or is that sanity, I forget...
<Eddmario> I always waited a few minutes so they'd melt a bit and suck up the juice
<otakon> Eddmario: yh, now. how about when you were 6?
<Derpdash> Eddmario: ...Then why freeze them?
<RAWRity> Eddmario: well that just defeats the purpose of freezin it in the first place
<Capitol_Accent> AttacktheAndalite Using the Capitol Accent around others can be somewhat difficult in text, but if two tributes from District Twelve can win the Hungah Games, I guess anything is possible! Except an uprising, that's just prepostrous!
<Meanwhile> I'm awake at 7:30AM talking about freeze pops. I've lost control of my life.
<Eddmario> Derpdash, RAWRity: I said a BIT, not all the way. Geeze, make sure you read something fully before you comment on it...
<Capitol_Accent> . . . why is my name Capitol_Accent?
<otakon> Meanwhile: took you awhile to realize that.
<Capitol_Brony> Much bettah
<Derpdash> Eddmario: Ahh...
<scottish-geeky> hial Scotland
<Dr_Fumbles> Hi everybody! ... so, was there movies played today?
<Meanwhile> otakon: In my defense I've been having fun in chat.
<GabeMoist> Meanwhile, such is life on Bronystate
<Meanwhile> Dr_Fumbles: There was not.
<Capitol_Brony> Dr_Fumbles not today, come back next week
<Capitol_Brony> *weekend
<Dr_Fumbles> phew... thx
<Meanwhile> GabeMoist: Only when it's calmed down a bit, too many people usually.
<Eddmario> You know it's true: http://cheezburger.com/6443004160
<Dr_Fumbles> Oh, and I also hate thos annoying plastic tubes
<hen3ry> conversation.subject=subject_chooser(rand(salt)+rand(sugar)); // Yeah, this will work.
<AttacktheAndalite> You know what tastes good? Put a popsicle in the mirowave, melt it and drink the liquid
<Eddmario> hen3ry Wrong tab I take it?
<Capitol_Brony> Eddmario I simply cannot stand this tension! Waiting for something is such a ridiculous thought, I want it NAAAAHHHHWWW.
<RAWRity> this chat needs some De La Soul http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3kgjzUsDeg
<hen3ry> meeeeebe.
<Meanwhile> Hey did the weather stop talking?
<Dr_Fumbles> So... is everyone buffering, or just me?
<Eddmario> Capitol_Brony: Here, have a YouTube comment to hold you over. http://cheezburger.com/6447562496
<AttacktheAndalite> What are you talking about?
<Meanwhile> Dr_Fumbles: Nothing's on atm.
<Eddmario> Dr_Fumbles: Just you. We're watching the Gray and White show!
<Dr_Fumbles> 6_9
<GabeMoist> We're watching episode 4786 of the Buffer Show, Bronystate's most popular program
<Capitol_Brony> Eddmario That was quite clevah, if I do say so mahself.
<Eddmario> This is the most boring game of Snake I've ever seen...
<Dr_Fumbles> The circle... it speaks to me...
*AttacktheAndalite sits next to Meanwhile and leans on his shoulder
<hen3ry> This whole season of the Buffer Show is overrated. I swear the writers phoned it in.
<RAWRity> inb4 Mips does what YT did and makes the buffeer circle into a Snake game
<Capitol_Brony> inb4 STREAM!!
<Dr_Fumbles> I love this part
<Eddmario> hen3ry: But when the show ended, you fealt like you connected with it
<AttacktheAndalite> hen3ry: A lack of creativity on their part. Such a shame.
<hen3ry> Actually I felt very disconnected.
<Dr_Fumbles> This part makes me crai ev3ry time :'(
<hen3ry> As if they somehow just weren't reaching me.
<RAWRity> and now, the Doctor Who anime http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt3qZYUPi2Y
<Capitol_Brony> Even the Fifty-Sevahnth Hungah Games were more intahresting than this.
<Meanwhile> Once upon a time, in the magical land of Bronystate. There was a buffer. And it buffered until the seasons changed, and the lakes dried, and life ceased to exist, and after the barren ball of rock that was a planet was consumed by the fire of it's nearest star, scattering the ash across the universe in a wave unfelt by the galaxy. And legend has it, that on the fringe of existence, it still
<Meanwhile> buffers.
<Eddmario> hn3ry: Well, at least they had the finale include an uncensored, unedited, unadulterated lesbian sex orgy
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, The whatnow?
<hen3ry> Eddmario: ... dem spoilers...
<GabeMoist> Yes, best doctor
<Capitol_Brony> I haven't a response to that.
<AttacktheAndalite> Eddmario: I don't even
<hen3ry> scuse me, I need to find summink to wipe the drool off my face with...
<Eddmario> hen3ry: Guess what? It turned out one of the women was a hermaphrodite, and ended up getting one of the other women pregnant
<hen3ry> .. and to barf in.
<AttacktheAndalite> Eddmario: Wait, how can they show that on cable TV?
<Meanwhile> Something clearly went wrong in chat while I was typing that...
<Dr_Fumbles> If you look real closely, you can see that there is no video playing
<Capitol_Brony> hen3ry Oh deah, not in here boy! This is mahogany!
<hen3ry> you're not thinking 4th dimensionally, Dr_Fumbles!
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile in the chat ehile Meanwhile was typeing
<Spectrum_Rush|> *while
<Eddmario> AttackAndalite: You got it on cable? I thought they only were allowed to have it On Demand...
<Dr_Fumbles> hen3ry: OF COURSE!
<RAWRity> but yeah, apparently some industrious Whovians made Dr. Who anime video
<AttacktheAndalite> Eddmario: I have satellite
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: did i ever tell ya i love your nick choice :p
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, it seems quite impressive so far
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|: You did not.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: well i do
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|: <3
<Eddmario> If you think about it, right now, someone is having sex
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: <3
<hen3ry> statistically speaking, those someones include your mom.
<Meanwhile> Eddmario: And someone else is eating a doughnut, what's your point.
<Spectrum_Rush|> OH SHNAP
<Capitol_Brony> I'm waiting for the Quarter Quell. Foahty-eight tributes last time. Now THAT was intahresting.
<GabeMoist> Meanwhile, and someone else is up at 4 in the morning making chocolate pudding because they've lost control of their life
<AttacktheAndalite> Eddmario: Please don't say that. It might actually be happening now....unfortunately she talks about it
<Eddmario> Meanwhile: And the catergory is, stuff Bronysith is doing right now.
<hen3ry> No, the answer is not "light urple."
<Meanwhile> Eddmario: Boring someone to death?
<Meanwhile> otakon did you fall asleep or something?
<otakon> no
<Eddmario> [You need a BronyState Gold Accoutn to view this comment]
<Capitol_Brony> I'm sitting in front on my computah while displaying my use of the Capitol Accent through typing. It is not as easy as you may considah it to be.
<Meanwhile> Talk more, I miss correcting you.
<Eddmario> [ERROR: anvklaew9o8$vnq#

<Capitol_Brony> [This will nevah be populah]
*AttacktheAndalite can think of a few days she wants to do right now
<AttacktheAndalite> things*
<hen3ry> Thursday is always a great day to do...
<hen3ry> oh
<Dr_Fumbles> I like to do Friday
<RAWRity> and then THIS made a very good case for scrapping the whole "ash as the hero" thing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2SA4GyXb2U&feature=related
<hen3ry> Friday's so lazy. She just lays back and expects you to do all the work...
<Capitol_Brony> I like trains.
<AttacktheAndalite> I meant things. Days came out by accient.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Inb4 eventually Ash is an old man in Gen like...37
<Dr_Fumbles> Ash? A hero? lol
<sub06905> This Spy Aria: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkGwqsrfEeI&feature=plcp
<hen3ry> AttacktheAndalite: Sure, you did. ;D
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: inb4 ash is still 10 in gen 37
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, Pokemon Special might've made a good Pokemon anime
*Capitol_Brony yawns
<Dr_Fumbles> Next season, he'll be 9
<AttacktheAndalite> Spectrum_Rush|: Actually I did.
<Lunar_Brony> I'm sick of the Capitol Accent.
<RAWRity> GabeMoist: I really, REALLY wish they had gone the route of the manga, and every new gen had a new protagonist.
<Dr_Fumbles> Anyone play PMD?
<Lunar_Brony> Dr_Fumbles wut?
<WalkerPony89> What's PMD?
<Dr_Fumbles> I was hoping someone would know...
<Lunar_Brony> my brain is operating on %01 maximum capacity
<Spectrum_Rush|> pokemon mystery dungeon
<Meanwhile> As always.
<Lunar_Brony> 01% ?
<Lunar_Brony> IDC
<Dr_Fumbles> Spectrum_Rush|: Thank You
<Spectrum_Rush|> :)
<WalkerPony89> Then no, I have not
<Dr_Fumbles> Why the hell did they skip gen 5?
<Lunar_Brony> I have never played a Pokemon game
<Lunar_Brony> in my entire life
<hen3ry> We couldn't handle 100%, Lunar_Brony. No one could. It'd be like suddenly having Derp-o-vision.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i love this pic http://derpy.me/eqa61
<Spectrum_Rush|> blasphemous :O
<Lunar_Brony> hen3ry it would be a change of scenery . . .
<Meanwhile> Very Day of the Dead.
<Lunar_Brony> buck it. I'm too tired to care
<hen3ry> If you borrowed my brain, it'd be like, dude, that's creepy.
<Meanwhile> That's the holidays name isn't it? I'm knackered and the more I look the more it doesn't sound right.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://violetmagician.deviantart.com/gallery/33225294#/d4da5wl
<Lunar_Brony> . . . why am I still wearing this wooden tie?
<Dr_Fumbles> If you borrowed my brain, I would die
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep pretty much
<Meanwhile> Dude, that stuff is awesome.
<Dr_Fumbles> Lunar_Brony: Wha... I don't even...
<hen3ry> Can a vegetarian cannibal eat people who are in a persistant coma?
<Lunar_Brony> seriously, I'm wearing a Dress Shirt, Dress Pants, and a Wooden Tie
<Spectrum_Rush|> you don't want to borrow my brain...
<Marx> Well, I'd show everyone what I've found to be the rival to the rapping dog, but... Wow it's bad.
*AttacktheAndalite groans in boredom. "I need chocolate, like now"
*Lunar_Brony throws chocolate chips muffins at AttacktheAndalite
<Lunar_Brony> happy?
<Dr_Fumbles> AttacktheAndalite: Did you say... Chocolate? .... CHOCOLATE!?
*AttacktheAndalite eats the muffins "Yes and no. Yes because it's something. No, because I don't have much money on me"
<Lunar_Brony> AttacktheAndalite they're free
<hen3ry> Chocolate does nothing for me. Not enough oestrogen receptors I guess.
<Dr_Fumbles> I don't require the nourishment of food
<Lunar_Brony> White Chocolate is delicious
<Dr_Fumbles> I agree
<RAWRity> so, you guys know how Digimon's anime was infinitely better than Pokemon's?
<otakon> it's not even chocolate
<otakon> RAWRity: except that movie
<RAWRity> otakon: that movie was Fox's fault.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: When it got around to Wargreymon power bombing everyone, yeah.
<Lunar_Brony> otakon so? It's made from cocoa butter, which is from the cocao bean

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> last way longer than i expected
<WalkerPony89> scottish-geeky: Nope!
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Woah...I mean, you pinged me out of my daydream for that?
<scottish-geeky> WalkerPony89: (\
<RAWRity> I occasionally enjoy metal, but I find a lot of it to be tired and monotonous
<WalkerPony89> scottish-geeky: /)
<hen3ry> I've got another year ahead of 8 am classes. Snot cool.
<Meanwhile> Agreed actually, I thought he was toast about five minutes after he showed up.
<Polydunami> I dunno about that, scottish-geeky http://tinyurl.com/c3uu796
<scottish-geeky> Polydunami: o har har
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yeah, except other than being annoying he wasn't breaking any rules
<Polydunami> I'm tired and slightly buzzed :P
<GabeMoist> 3AM here
<Meanwhile> Yeah but generally those're the sort who do something stupid quickly.
<scottish-geeky> Polydunami: ok
<RAWRity> I've probably showed this before, but a friend of mine made this with colored pencils: http://seanwd.deviantart.com/art/semi-truck-274994544
<kirzstryfe> 8,6he's been around before I'm pretty sure, but it was a couple of months back I think
<Polydunami> Your friend is fucking crazy :D
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, that's awesome
<AttacktheAndalite> RAWRity: Someone should hire your friend to do artwork, man
<RAWRity> AttacktheAndalite: that was actually a commission.

<GabeMoist> worst chess board ever
<scottish-geeky> Meanwhile: lol
<kirzstryfe> 8,6don't spam symbols scottish-geeky
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: that's an awful move

<Meanwhile> I want to play chess now. :I
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh relax kyrz this room is way more dead
*otakon waves goodnight to chat.
<GabeMoist> G'Night otakon
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: it would be the third space on the rook's row. So you'd be moving the pawn forward one space.
<Meanwhile> otakon: There's nothing to correct on there.
<Polydunami> I'm late, I'm late for a very important date!
<scottish-geeky> nite otakon sleep well

<RAWRity> GabeMoist: not if they're a good player.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well make a youtube playlist instead :p
<RAWRity> First rule of chess is to always assume your opponent will make the best possible move.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6have a few already from the request nights, but a few of those are meh for my tastes
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i yhougt it was " don't do anything stupid"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> thougt*
<Meanwhile> Go to bed already. :P
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, and they'll assume you make the best possible moves, so you respond by making the worst possible moves
<RAWRity> GabeMoist: except then they've got the advantage

<RAWRity> that's like saying "I'm fighting an expert martial artists, so I'll fight by pretending to have a seizure! That'll throw them off!"
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, that's when you get the upper hand by setting the chess board on fire
<scottish-geeky> [wklmjhe]JRP2234: bad idea
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> no its not
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> LIES

<OtakuTom> I'm learning that, too, SB
<Derpdash> how?
<Vordox> SuperSeaBrony64: I may get to you in a near future
<Vordox> :)
<SuperSeaBrony64> 11,02:O
*SuperSeaBrony64 hugs Vordox
<Vordox> It takes time to make a unique animation and desktop pony for each mod
<Vordox> So far 6 are done
<d3rb> just take a regular desktop pony, change colours, done. thats the cheat way
<Vordox> d3rb: I don't work like that, d3rb =P
<MadSurge> :D
<d3rb> i know you dont, yours are very good
<Vordox> A sec
<OtakuTom> Yea, but I want mine to actually do something related to me, like play a video game :P
<Meanwhile> Recolours are a little below the ponycreator in terms of originality.
<d3rb> lol i never said it was a good way to make em, just a quick way
<Invi> lol dat bird
<Invi> hay Yahooz
<OtakuTom> Hmmm...maybe it's about time I actually register the domain for the website I plan on making.
<Invi> OtakuTom what is that website about? ^^
<killerpony7733> looks like a glider
<OtakuTom> I plan on making a site where I do reviews of anime and video games.
<Derpdash> Mmmm.....i wub muffins <3
<killerpony7733> ded
<Meanwhile> That thing is fucked.
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Well if you haven't noticed..
<Vordox> All animations I do mostly are unique :p
<Vordox> http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/6375/compuv.png
<OtakuTom> Yea, I noticed that, Vordox :P
<Vordox> There
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Wow
<killerpony7733> :O
<Vordox> Guess which is which :P
<Vordox> Also
<OtakuTom> I didn't want to bother you about them, 'cause I knew you were making them for the mods.
<Vordox> I need to remodel Phase4's OC to make him more pony
<OtakuTom> I know 3 of them right away.
<OtakuTom> I know Wrek, Sumi, and Phase, 'cause I'm always around when they stream.
<Vordox> They are the only ones that can use their stream for their OC
<Vordox> :D
<killerpony7733> nilla, wrek, sumi, phase, scoots, nittany,
<Phase4> 00,02dat vi oc
<OtakuTom> The other 3...I wouldn't know off the top of my head, but I have some ideas
<Vordox> Nittany and Scootaloo and Violet Vanilla....They have issues with their computers
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Do i win?
<OtakuTom> ah
<Vordox> Yeah you won killerpony7733 :P
<killerpony7733> What does i get? :3
<Vordox> But yeah Phase4
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> Vivi on the left Phase4 on top Wrek in middle Sumica on right Scoot-Scootaloo in corner cold frost nittany bottom Vordox
<Vordox> I'll remodel your OC next time i get around to hi
<Vordox> him
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush|AFK: Yep
<killerpony7733> Vordox: :O usrs?
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|AFK: Sounds like a description of the worlds most unbalanced orgy,
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> Meanwhile: it does doesn't it
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Of course, my goal to try and not be bored of spriting before all mods have atleast 3 unique animations :L)
<Vordox> :)
<Vordox> So far, Wrek is the only one totally done
<Vordox> Heck, he has 10 animations
<Mutterguy> /outofcontext ^
<Vordox> More then enough
<d3rb> Phase4, this is not how you stay away from steam and save money :|
<Invi> Vordox that sounds like a whole load of work doing an animation
<Vordox> And then also
<Vordox> We have this offshot
<Vordox> http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/6510/standing.gif
<Vordox> Guess who =P
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Ok i lost the track of thought were you saying the mods OC's or that you will actually make me a OC sprite? :D
<Vordox> Invi. Whole load
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Bronysith!
<Vordox> A sec, let me show you Nittany's ONLY FRIGGING animation
<Meanwhile> Dat kick
<Vordox> This is Nittany's ONLY animation
<Mutterguy> So i 've arrived at a mention of 'unbalanced orgy'...
<Vordox> "Create a tornado"
<Vordox> http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6118/feedbackf.jpg
<Vordox> All those "borders" are one frame each
<Invi> Vordox no dusting? :D
<Vordox> Invi: Dusting?
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Nittany dusts a lot.
<Vordox> Invi: Oh that's later on for his Nittany's OC
<d3rb> thats awesome Vordox. alot of work
<Vordox> NIttany has 2, Nittany and Cold Front
<Vordox> d3rb: I only sprite when I have the itch =P
<Meanwhile> Vordox: you should do those on commission, you'd get swamped.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Swamped?
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> You have NO idea how many projects I'm juggling atm. :
<Vordox> :P
<Meanwhile> Vordox: The swamp has been doubled.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Yeah, and not to mention my current economy is making me only eat each other day
<Vordox> =P
<Vordox> Until College begins again
<d3rb> should makew that another project, learn to juggle for real
<Mutterguy> So everyyone here aiming to join the 16 mile club?
<Vordox> d3rb: After I got my Rhythm is Magic to work

*Mutterguy can't hear the engines...
<Mutterguy> oH YEAH....
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> what rules Vordox ?
<Derpdash> ohh now i get it
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, they're off :P
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush|AFK: Desktop Ponies sprites has "rules"
<ViolaGrey> mornin ponies~
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> k
<Vordox> On how they must be made
<d3rb> how many rules?
<Vordox> d3rb: Firstly, Only 2x2 cubes
<Vordox> (One example of this rule broken is Octavia's sprite and S2 Luna)
<Vordox> Where they use smaller pixels in bigger works
<Vordox> For the trained eye, those are eyesores. :
<Vordox> :p
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> that butt hurt feel
<d3rb> what unit does the 2x2 refer to>
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> Vordox: s2 luna always did look a bit weird to me
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush|AFK: It's the hair
<Derpdash> O.o
<Vordox> http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2747/sumicafeedback.png <--- This I love doing, recreating the "body" with no fill colours, make it look awesome.
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> Vordox: wait wouldn't that mean Celestia broke the rules to?
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush|AFK: Haven't seen that.
<Derpdash> DO A BARREL ROLL
<d3rb> it must be damn close if it doesnt, shes as big as luna
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> Vordox: really?, she part of standard DT ponies
<Meanwhile> You know this is way more epic with Power Ranger theme songs in the background.
<Vordox> So s Octavia
<Vordox> But meh, It's more of a "preference" now
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> Vordox: the cello right?
<Vordox> As long as it's not overdone, it's fine
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Is that kerbins version of australia your landing at? :O
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush|AFK: The arm holding the string instrument to the Cello
<Phase4> 00,02not sure
<Vordox> Check the pixels there
<Phase4> 00,02dont think kerbin has an australia
<Ilchymis> Please, Tuiles theme fits this nicely.
<Ilchymis> Guiles*
<d3rb> just look for a bunch of kerbin doing burnout in a commodor while drinking beer, thats kerbin australia
<Mutterguy> nah you want the theme bristish airlines used to use
<Vordox> But yeah, I've been doing sprites for about..
<Vordox> errr...
<Vordox> First time I ever made a sprite I think I was 8...
<Vordox> And then kept it as a hobby.
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> wow
<Vordox> So now I'm 27 so about 20 years. :P ish

<Chrysalis> cool
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: You play tribes ascend?
<Chrysalis> i may or may not bee hooked on that stretch those glutes vid
<Chrysalis> i tried it
<Chrysalis> couldnt stand the game
<Phase4> 00,02if that was a conversation
<killerpony7733> I guess how the game mechanics works puts some off
<Phase4> 00,02why were they facing foward
<Derpdash> *In-Game Logic Fail*
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Please try to save malik here,
<MadSurge> BOOM
<Chrysalis> you can actually save her here
<Chrysalis> but its damn hard
<killerpony7733> Depends on your firepower
<Chrysalis> shes dead
<Chrysalis> you NEED to kill the guy with the gas grenade
<Chrysalis> or shes as good as dead
<killerpony7733> Damn
<killerpony7733> He may not have enough firepower to beat them all in time
<Chrysalis> Phase4 go for the guy with the gas greneade shes dead if it goes off
<Chrysalis> killerpony7733 most of them dont actually do that much damage
<Aps> guys who here knows stuff about kittens?
<MadSurge> Let me guess, she's vital for the no-kill run?
<killerpony7733> Not really,
<Chrysalis> not vital for it
<Chrysalis> but shes been so much help
<killerpony7733> But you get alot of xp
<Meanwhile> Aps: yo.
<Phase4> 00,02which button is the typhoon
<killerpony7733> Uhhh

<killerpony7733> Well you can try
<Aps> Meanwhile, k
<killerpony7733> But explosives crates are there as a option
<Phase4> 00,02i cant remember which button it is though

<Pwnies> :D
<Pwnies> Me
<Lil_B> MadSurge lets all call upon the Sea-Horses XD
<MaxTheBrony> I have pony_9695
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<Pwnies> God that's awesome
<killerpony7733> More or less here
<DB_Brony> you mean the audio series?
<Derpdash> Confound these keyboards, they drive me to cut off human fingers!
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Shoo be doo!
<MaxTheBrony> The animated episodes is up to two episodesright?
<pony_9695> it needs to be its own show
<Lil_B> MadSurge call upon the seapony when you're in Distress
<MegaMoonShine> Hey, dudes! :)
<DB_Brony> yup, max
<killerpony7733> MegaMoonShine: Oi
<MegaMoonShine> What needs to be its own show?
<MaxTheBrony> Heya MegaMoonShine :)
<DB_Brony> MegaMoonShine!
<pony_9695> doctor whooves and derpy
<DB_Brony> :O
<MaxTheBrony> Dr.whooves , i think it would make an awesome episode atleast
*MegaMoonShine hugs killerpony7733 MaxTheBrony and DB_Brony
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Flyboy> confound these alarms! the drive me to run!
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah, that would be a great series
*DB_Brony hugs megamoonshine back
<pony_9695> two characters that we created
*MaxTheBrony hugs MegaMoonShine ^^
<pony_9695> the possabilities
<DB_Brony> well we half created Dr. Whooves
<pony_9695> we named him
<MaxTheBrony> We as in the brony community right=
<MaxTheBrony> ?
<Phase4> 00,02hack so hard i get achive
<Derpdash> i think they should have a Dr. Whooves episode in season 3
<killerpony7733> Not exactly' We named them due to the resemblence to a certain show and the other due to the internet
<MaxTheBrony> Derpdash: It still not to late for that :3
<Derpdash> and it has Dr. Who references and such
<DB_Brony> yeah. we = brony community.
<pony_9695> what the difference
<pony_9695> *whats
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: Fanon vs Canon=canon wins
<DB_Brony> DerpDash, i think the only thing stopping them from that is copyrights
<pony_9695> killer, yes
<DB_Brony> they were even cautious about using "Dr. Whooves" as a name.
<XAX> Nothing else in the world matters when i have a new chapter of Vinyl and Octavia: University Days to read.
<pony_9695> bitch plz hasbro doesnt need to start a doctor whooves thing
<pony_9695> we already did that
<Derpdash> :O)==, I have a Pinkie Pie Launcher, oyur argument is invalid.
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<killerpony7733> I mean the fanon vs canon thing extends to as far as how people think having a alicorn OC is ok
<XAX> Hasbro is an independent black woman who don't need no man
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<DB_Brony> :P)== BITCH! DERP LAUNCHER READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
<pony_9695> hell we could fix it up here and watch doctor whooves on this website
<pony_9695> if we asked for it
<Phase4> 00,02i have zero darts :(
<MadSurge> Only Lauren Faust is allowed to have an alicorn OC :D
<Derpdash> DB_Brony: Lets just call a truce and eat muffins, shall we?
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: You mean the fan made episodes?
<pony_9695> sure
<DB_Brony> yeah, but those are made by just one guy and therefore they take a while to make
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Yeah only allowed alicorn besides canon alicorns
<killerpony7733> I litterally facehoof everytime i hear or see a alicorn OC
<DB_Brony> DerpDash: waaay ahead of you
<pony_9695> and with some more views and a little sponsering we can really do this
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02i'm screwed
<MegaMoonShine> killerpony7733: I know that feel
<Derpdash> Phase4: Should've done a barrel roll...:'(
<DB_Brony> well....unscrew yourself
<RoboGerbil> killerpony7733: i dunno, nyx is pretty cute too but i totally agree
<DB_Brony> sorry that's all i got
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: Well no, Cause one thing is bronystate can't take money in anyway due to copyright things and what not
<Lil_B> damnit, the bass is to strong for my tiny PC Speakers :(
<killerpony7733> RoboGerbil: Nyx+
<killerpony7733> ?*
<MegaMoonShine> I like Nyx too :)
<nipa_> hi everypony!
<Derpdash> Hi nipa_
<DB_Brony> hey, nipa_
<pony_9695> no u mis understand, we already have people making episodes
<nipa_> : D
<alexxm> hey nipa_ how've you been
<MegaMoonShine> hi nipa_ :)
<pony_9695> they just arent well animated
<MaxTheBrony> :O I got the planet side Beta :D
<pony_9695> but we could fix that
<Lil_B> hi nipa_
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: You do realise money doesn't exactly solve that? the issue is more the skill of the animators and what not
<alexxm> yes destroy the walls
<DB_Brony> pony_9695: if the team at studio B could work on it.
<Lil_B> how far into the game is this?
<Meanwhile> Smash the system! fight the power! What are we talking about?!
<Derpdash> Phase4 - Punching holes in walls since whenever the fuck he felt like it
<nipa_> hahaha
<killerpony7733> Yes money gives them more free time to make them, But hardly helps them animate better
<pony_9695> well thats where the money comes in
<nipa_> money is everything!
<pony_9695> we pitch in and try and fund a animation team
<Meanwhile> an*
<killerpony7733> Plus possible chance of getting sued by hasbro for taking money to make something that is MLP FIM
<pony_9695> trust me there are many bronies out there with the skill
<Meanwhile> If the following word begins with a vowel the connective is an.
<pony_9695> its basically avertisment
<Meanwhile> No advertising in chat
<pony_9695> why would they sue
<Lil_B> Meanwhile but there are still some words where its strange, our english teacher said that it can be confusing in rare situations
<killerpony7733> But the thing that stops them is hasbro being able to sue them for using and making MLP FIM content etc
<Derpdash> ....Sometimes....I like to catch furry things with my arse cheeks
<XAX> wut.
<MegaMoonShine> O__________0
<Meanwhile> Lil_B: Some situations can be confusing in letters but it's largely about the sound produced.
<Derpdash> :P
<killerpony7733> and accepting money for it too
<Phase4> 00,02y u no recharge more than one battery :<
<Lil_B> Meanwhile lets just stick with the Poor Literacy is Cewl method :P
<Phase4> 00,02its incredibly anoying
<Meanwhile> Lil_B: Nein!
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Cause badly thought of mechanics
<Lil_B> Meanwhile DOCH!
<pony_9695> well think of it like this. we pitch in our own money to pay for something that is almost like advertisement for them
<Derpdash> ...yes
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, no, i think it works fine
<Phase4> 00,02but it should recharge more than one
<pony_9695> why in the hell would they sue us for that
<Meanwhile> Isn't there already the thankyou project for that?
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: Copyright laws, and the fact they are the only ones mean't to be able to make money from it etc
<pony_9695> and we wouldnt get any profit from it, we would just be creating a good show
<Phase4> 00,02how convenient that this guy stands on THIS part of THIS wall while smoking
<Phase4> 00,02meens i can do this
<DB_Brony> pony_9695: are we still talking about the dr.whooves thing?
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<pony_9695> yes
<Wrek> 05the mechanic would be completly acceptable had it recharged atleast 2, or all but very slowly
<alexxm> crush him
<Meanwhile> I have no idea /what/ we're talking about. I've just stopped playing LoL.
<alexxm> ded
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Wrek
<Derpdash> Poor guy he just wanted lung cancer :'(
<MaxTheBrony> and Heya Meanwhile
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: Accepting money of any kind to create something that has a copyright law on it and has not any permission to make said content from said show you can get your ass sued
<Lil_B> hi there wrek
<Dark_Horst> what doctor whooves thing exactly? did i miss something?
<MegaMoonShine> Ohai Wrek :)
<Meanwhile> Is it me or is chat rather laggy atm?
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Funding one and what not and how laws stop any way of funding a animation team from making them more frequently
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: there is always the possibilit of completely unrelated donations
<MaxTheBrony> How do you know if its lagging Meanwhile
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: so, who's wanting to fund hwat?
<DB_Brony> Meanwhile: must be you, chat's fine for me
<Meanwhile> MaxTheBrony: Mostly the sudden surge of messages every so often.
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: No no no the general idea of donating money for a team of animators to make fanmade episodes for dr.whooves for example
<Meanwhile> MaxTheBrony: partly because a message pops up saying "lag"
<pony_9695> hasbro is a kind and smart company, our funding would be for our self satisfaction. if they were to sue us then they would sue every one doing the same god damn thing im talking about
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: okay then
<MaxTheBrony> Are you still talking about Dr.Whooves O.o?
<pony_9695> on youtube i mean
<Derpdash> Dude that was like 10 minutes ago?
<Meanwhile> I recall reading somewhere that under certain conditions Hasbro would be forced to take legal action to maintain control of their IP. Can't remember what it was though.
<Dark_Horst> that door seems interesting
<MaxTheBrony> Is Phase going for no kill playthrough?
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: You do not know how a corperation works do you?, if someone seriously attempts to get funding or donations that involves money to make a actual type of episode or something they will do something about it
<Dark_Horst> you know, pepsing a single guy might be considered a litte overkill
<DB_Brony> one thing i don't get about hasbro though is why they don't use the youtube feature
<pony_9695> how would they possibly do that. buy some how tracing where all the money came from
<killerpony7733> Any corperation with a copyright on certain things will do everything to avoid anyone from profitting from their content
<JRP2234[Web]> fuck superman 64
<Dark_Horst> is that sumica playing?
<JRP2234[Web]> fuck it to hell
<JRP2234[Web]> busting my balls
<alexxm> so would the brony documentry john de lacies doing fall under this killerpony7733
<pony_9695> they have done the animation already and they didnt get sued
<MegaMoonShine> Dark_Horst: No it's phase
<killerpony7733> alexxm: Explain please,
<pony_9695> what im saying is we help make the animation better
<MaxTheBrony> If we give critique yes
<Dark_Horst> lol, dude got resist augs
<pony_9695> therefore giving us a better youtube show
<alexxm> killerpony7733 sorry i was unsure if de lancie was making money off of it?
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: The thing is hasbro will easily find out if a project with a team to make fanmade MLP FIM episodes are being funded by people
<killerpony7733> alexxm: Well if it's free thats alright, If it's not i still believe he can easily have gotten permission to do it
<alexxm> ok then
<pony_9695> no what they will find out is that a skill full animator with a nice pay cheak made a glorious youtube show
<Phase4> 00,02no fair
<Derpdash> i hate the ai of the enemies in this game
<Derpdash> theyre so...
<Phase4> 00,02Realy no fair
<Derpdash> robotic
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: As i said as long as no one funds them or donates money to them, and it's all made for free nothing is being broken. But if they are then hasbro will try to sue them
<Dark_Horst> they must have some kind of emp dampening in there
<killerpony7733> He should have gotten a stun gun due to how good it is
<MaxTheBrony> He has one
<MaxTheBrony> but he prob got no ammo
<Meanwhile> I've been watching this discussion for several minutes and I still don't know what the basis of it is.
<Phase4> 00,02Y U FAIL ME PEPS
<pony_9695> why if they are the ones who benefit from the free advertisement, you see youtube isnt just intertanment its also the biggest advertisement network ever
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<Derpdash> lol
<pony_9695> they wouldnt see it as copy right just more as a fanmade parody
<pony_9695> imean not as a copyright
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: That's just non related profit, They get it cause of adverts on the video else it's not a direct profit that comes only because of the video
<pony_9695> so thats how they will see this show
<Derpdash> wtf?
<XAX> You know what i can't wait for?
<pony_9695> i mean shed.mov and all that shit is well animated and they have a whole season
<XAX> Another Gigabit stream.
<pony_9695> no law sues
<XAX> He is awesome.
<Derpdash> XAX: Same here
<alexxm> i agree XAX
<shana> pony_9695: it's non profit and would probably fall under fair use
<Derpdash> shed.mov is disturbing though
<DB_Brony> Guys, Hasbro probably won't sue anyone for fanmade content with or without money. they haven't been doing that with artist commisions, so why start and in the process take a chance at losing a large part of your audience
<MadSurge> ^
<pony_9695> thank you brony
<killerpony7733> Well look at bronystate they can't take money or anything due to copyright
<DB_Brony> That being said, hasbro DOES HAVE THE RIGHT to sue others for making moneywith fanmade content
<MaxTheBrony> Do Bronystate need money?
<pony_9695> THATS BECAUSE BRONY HANDLES WITH REAL EPISODES
<DB_Brony> Bronystate get's paid in hugs
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: They always could, But they can't take it even if they wanted
<pony_9695> the have to be careful with that
<MaxTheBrony> Im sure "you" can donate to this site :O Why wouldnt it be possible?
<Phase4> 00,02y u guys no stand together
<Wrek> 05killerpony7733: you got it all wrong.
<Wrek> 05we could always charge and accept money
<Wrek> 05but it wouldnt be legal
<Wrek> 05but we could
<Wrek> 05the point here is
<Wrek> 05we dont
<DB_Brony> what wrek said.
<Wrek> 05casue we aint greedy fucktards
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Yes, and thats my point
<MaxTheBrony> But if we want to donate Can we do it?
<pony_9695> no bwrek we arent being greedy
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: As he said yes, But due them not wanting it and the law possibly coming down on them no
<MaxTheBrony> allright :)
<pony_9695> we are tring to see if starting a derpy and doctor whooves would work out
<pony_9695> i say it could be promising
<MaxTheBrony> Pony_9695 it has allready started , and it does work
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<killerpony7733> pony_9695: But the overall point i'm making is it's a god damn scary minefield of copyright and laws
<DB_Brony> I have a question. If all you guys did were gaming and art streams could you in that case accept money legally?
<killerpony7733> Do something wrong and you are sure to get in trouble
<Phase4> 00,02STAND TOGETHER DAMNIT
<MaxTheBrony> DB_Brony: I thought that too , because ppl on twitch and others can be donated too
<pony_9695> yes but cant we just try plus hasbro has always sided with the fans
<killerpony7733> DB_Brony: As it funds the site and what is being streamed which has copyright i do not think so,
<Wrek> 05you could donate to us if you wanted as we are already now
<Wrek> 05but the thign is
<Wrek> 05we dotn accept donations
<pony_9695> why would they disagree and sterr up it all up
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<DB_Brony> killerpony7733: but what part about gaming and art would be copyright?
<MaxTheBrony> O.o Be right back gotta Try PlanetS2
<killerpony7733> DB_Brony: I said if it funds the site, Then it's around the no part. If it just funds the person with what they make and what not maybe
<pony_9695> they still havent sued youtube and theres so much copy right in there already
<Wrek> 05that is where you are wrong killer
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Explain it to me
<pony_9695> how would this show be different
<DB_Brony> pony_9695: because all that copyright content on youtube is illegal
<Chocobunny> On what days do they send the newsletter?
<Wrek> 05streaming games and art on twitch for an example does not collide with the copyright law. streaming a movie does becasue it was covered under the copyright law. games were not (which they try to change now but fail)
<pony_9695> really but yet they have not been sued
<DB_Brony> and so would be the show....if the creators monotized off of it
<Wrek> 05so i can stream my lets play of X game and accept donations which could be used to fun anything.
<Chrysalis> and the postman just delivered Â£13000 worth of paper to my house
<Chrysalis> awesome
<DB_Brony> Thanks for answering my question Wrek :)!
<Phase4> 00,02Y U MAKE NONLEATHLE SO HARDE
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Lil_B> Chrysalis: with a Truck?! Or Gold Paper?
<pony_9695> brony you are making it seem like you dont trust hasbro to much
<killerpony7733> Wrek: That makes sense, Kinda where i was pointing to actually. Just that it can end up colliding funding the site directly and since it does stream copyrighted material
<Chocobunny> On what days do they send the newsletter?
<MaxTheBrony> Chrysalis: O.o why?
<pony_9695> they arent a bunch of sue hapy freaks you know
<Chocobunny> ded
<Chrysalis> MaxTheBrony my University certificate just arrived
<MaxTheBrony> Chrysalis: Nice :)
<Chrysalis> yup
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: on what? :)
<Chrysalis> Masters Degree in Computer Science with Games Development
<XAX> Chrysalis: You had me thinking a truck dropped off Â£13000 of plain A4 paper.
<shana> pony_9695: why don't you just ask hasbro if it is ok to do X
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<Chrysalis> XAX, it would take several trucks for that much paper
<MaxTheBrony> Chrysalis: Awesome :)
<shana> get permission from the legal department and your ready to go
<DB_Brony> Pony_9695: I know and I pointed that out, it's just that they have the right to sue and sometimes that's a possibility you don't want to take.
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: :O my favorite kind of egghead! :$
<pony_9695> shana im sorry but im not on speaking terms with hasbro
<pony_9695> what with being an anon and all
<Meanwhile> Implying Hasbro speaks to you.
<Meanwhile> Like the voice of god.
<shana> pony_9695: yeah I mean if we're talking about funding a team or something
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Phase4> 00,02dats enough deus ex for now
<Meanwhile> What is thy bidding oh Hasbro
<killerpony7733> Wrek: But yeah it's a minefield with it comes to copyrights and law.
<MaxTheBrony> +Phase4 thanks for streaming it :)
<Meanwhile> "Make more playsets
<DB_Brony> something makes me think that meanwhile is the voice of god...
<Meanwhile> Hasbro ha spoken.
<Lil_B> Chrysalis sounds good, where did you study it? There is nothing around here where you can Study something like this
<Chrysalis> University of Hull, UK
<pony_9695> hasbro would simple shrug it off as a fan made series
<Meanwhile> DB_Brony: God must be a miserable bugger.
<pony_9695> no sueing what so ever
<DB_Brony> OBOY
<Chrysalis> pony_9695 it depends
<Chrysalis> theres laws which means that if they are informed in a certain way
<Chrysalis> they have no choice but to sue
<Derpdash> KSP! KSP!
<shana> pony_9695: you don't know that
<Chrysalis> because americans have some of the stupidest copyright and patent laws in the world
<pony_9695> shana when has hasbro proved me wrong
<shana> pony_9695: you assume that's how they would react, but that doesn't have any legal standing
<Chocobunny> Oh crap.
<Derpdash> Dat Skype
<Chocobunny> Kerbal.
<Chrysalis> actually it is, thats why that had to cease and decists the plushie maker
<MaxTheBrony> D: I hate Howard Stern now and forever >: /
<Chrysalis> they have to do something
<pony_9695> they are reasonable people shana
<Chrysalis> or they lose their right to the IP
<DB_Brony> Pony_9695: well yeah Hasbro probably would do that, but you never know
<Chocobunny> On what days do they send the newsletter?
<Meanwhile> Perhaps this could be solved by, you know, talking to Hasbro.
<Derpdash> MaxTheBrony: Why?
<killerpony7733> Chocobunny: Around wednesday or thursday me thinks
<pony_9695> a fanbased animation series is common for them to accept
<DB_Brony> Yes, MaxTheBrony. can we change the topic to that now.
<Lil_B> Chrysalis yes, there was a ruling by a Judge latly ( I think it was in the Motorola Microsoft case) where the Judge said "The Amarican Patent Systhem is completly broken"
<MaxTheBrony> yeas!
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Eulshy> ugh, its to early for this
<mario_kitten> atleast he survived
<Chocobunny> This will not end well.
<Chocobunny> Not at all.
<Chrysalis> they have such a strong suiing culture its enforced by law
<Chrysalis> which is just stupid
<pony_9695> no
<DB_Brony> Pony_9695: a company accepting the animation doesn't make it any more legal.
<Chrysalis> an accident by definition has no blame
<Chrysalis> but you go there and you can sue just about anyone for it
<pony_9695> they have never sued anyone for fanbased animations ok
<Chocobunny> Pingas mark one.
<pony_9695> why start now
<Chocobunny> Great rocket of pingas is actually edoing well.
<Chocobunny> Scratch that.
<Chrysalis> Phase4 why launch an icbm?
<Chocobunny> Chrysalis: It's a recreated ICBM, named Pingas.
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, not the final build :P
<Chocobunny> Pingas mark 2 under construction, Phase4?
<Eulshy> .me Yawns
<Jim> Hi!
<Meanwhile> Hi Jim.
<MegaMoonShine> Hi Jim :)
<pony_9695> there is some hope
<pony_9695> we hade just as much hope getting derpy back
<pony_9695> but we did it
<shana> hasn't hasbro taken down certain self-made pony plush actions?
<pony_9695> she would have been delated
<Chocobunny> Phase4: You need a thingy-special machine. I forgot the name, but it autosteers the rocket after you go into space.
<Jim> I just tasted cod tounge
<pony_1762j> yes, more power
<Jim> it was...interesting
<Phase4> 00,02theres a mod for that
<Eulshy> to early
<Chocobunny> Phase4: It's not a mod.
<Chocobunny> It's in the vanilla game.
<DB_Brony> Shana: I heard that, but I think that was resolved and it was only a few in order to make sure that they keep the intelectual property or something
<pony_9695> the fans are important to hasbro and they would not want to hurt that connection
<pony_9695> it can work
<Phase4> 00,02Chocobunny, ?
<Phase4> 00,02i'd like that
<pony_9695> you just got to want it to work
<Chocobunny> Phase4: Go into advanced shizzle. It was a long time since I played.
<shana> DB_Brony: ok thats pretty nice then
<Lil_B> and there is one law (I forgot the exact description) that sais: If you don't prodect you trademark from people, than you loose that trademark (or something like that), meaning, when 10 different componys use your Trademark, and you do nothing about it, and an 11th company comes around that also uses this Trademark, than you have no right sueing them if you haven't sued the other ones (but I could be mistaken about the exact wording , I
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> woah the wall
<RoboGerbil> shana: from what i heard its only the peole trying to make a business out of selling multiples of the same plush
<Lil_B> well... my longest comment yet I think :/
<Eulshy> Way too early for me
<Chocobunny> Somewhere around here.
<Chocobunny> Woah
<Chocobunny> Is that in the vanilla?
<pony_1762j> chocobunny: SAS module
<Meanwhile> Dat wall of legal jargon.
<MadSurge> Chocobunny: that's not the vanilla! :D
<pony_9695> im tring to inspire some ideas not start a court war
<MadSurge> Hi Meanwhile :)
<Chocobunny> Phase4: S.A.S module
<DB_Brony> Pony_9695: It's similar to artists taking comissions. Whileillegal Hasbro allows them to do it and doesn't sue them. I'm pretty sure the same thing would happen with a fanmade animation.
<pony_9695> this is a simple idea
<Meanwhile> Allo MadSurge.
<Phase4> 00,02Chocobunny, doesnt pilot after you seperate
<pony_9695> which can be achieved simply
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Chocobunny> It does if you put it at the top.
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, it helps
<Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin> hmm
<Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin> ah good
<Jim> http://i.imgur.com/yyElB.jpg
<RoboGerbil> so... whos taking law advice from and internet chat room?
<pony_9695> you just have to work at it for it to succed
<Meanwhile> Jim: Pfft.
<Chocobunny> And I think the key for it was T, Phase4.
<DB_Brony> Jim: wat..............
<Eulshy> are those tiny moving fingys people or chickens?
<shana> RoboGerbil: it's called wisdom of the crowd
<MaxTheBrony> Is the new Mlp season cooming this August guys?

<Cypresswolf|Work> that looks awesome :)
<MegaMoonShine> Machanical space squid go!

<alexxm> why is there only one kerbal in it
<Phase4> 00,02success
<Derpdash> back to the ocean for him MegaMoonShine
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> shana: nasa actually tried to make a mmo space game a while ago, dunno howthat turned out
<SpringStingray> It's a new cockpit they added
<Chocobunny> That thing + smart squids = not good.
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, new version
<Phase4> 00,02i wonder
<alexxm> ok then Phase4
<Cypresswolf|Work> The other 2 are on leave for psychiatric puporses :)
<shana> twi_sprinkle_GS17: you mean moon base alpha?
<Mutterguy> So much for operation banana. looks like the fist stage di did the splits
<Eulshy> Are you actually trying to gte somewhere, or do you just launch rockets to watch them blow up?
<Mutterguy> *first
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> shana: hm, i forgot about that one, but im actually thinking of a different one
<SpringStingray> Eulshy: He's trying new designs :p
<killerpony7733> Eulshy: That's what sumica does though phase loves to do it a few times
<Chocobunny> Fisting.
<Chocobunny> Yuck.Ã¶
<Phase4> 00,02oh awesome
<Phase4> 00,02i can do some clever
<Mutterguy> c'mon common typo
<SpringStingray> Look out! He's changing .cfg's!
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> shana: it included exploring earth nasa stations and learning about them and how to run rockets i think, i read a bout it many years ago
<Chocobunny> OH GOD.
<shana> Phase4: oO what editor is this? looks gtk based
<Phase4> 00,02shana, geany
<shana> Phase4: thanks, looks pretty neat
<Phase4> 00,02its my fav editor :)
<shana> I am trying to get used to emacs
<shana> otherwise vim user :D
<Kandarihu> If NASA were to make an MMO, they might have to deviate from any sort of educational goals in order to make the game more familiar with players. I don't think they're ever going to be in a place where they'd primarily need couriers, assassins and hunters in space.
<MaxTheBrony> Kandarihu: Sounds reasonable
<Phase4> 00,02YHES
<OtakuTom> I see NASA and MMO in one sentence...I can't help but think of Moonbase Alpha...lol
<Phase4> 00,02i've made my old designs work
<Phase4> 00,02TRI
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<SpringStingray> You hacker you :p
<Phase4> 00,02its been too long
<dalekkahn> Phase4: What did you change in the code?
<Mutterguy> Kandarihu, maybe if academia was a bit more cutthroat? like the old Unseen Universityi
<Mutterguy> ?
<Phase4> 00,02dalekkahn, version = 0.15.2 to version = 0.16.0
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02aparently its not that somple
<Phase4> 00,02simple'
<DB_Brony> Kandarihu: implying Moonbase Alpha isn't a already the greatest Space MMO that will ever be released.
<SpringStingray> Was gonna say, it'll be uynstable
<Chocobunny> Wat
<SpringStingray> A rocket launching MMO couldn't be that bad
<killerpony7733> Dafuq
<Chocobunny> ded
<alexxm> spunds like a good idea to me
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, physics change
<SpringStingray> Have a player the owner of a SPace Program on their own planet, sending rockets and getting pieces from other civilisations
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<MegaMoonShine> That would be pretty cool
<Chocobunny> Right
<Chocobunny> Give this idea to Nasa.
<Kandarihu> Then again, with the rise of SpaceX and the need for government austerity, I can honestly imagine NASA being turned into a regulatory agency for a fledgling space travel industry. If NASA were to make an MMO on the side under this vision, I can imagine it to be a bit more like EVE Online or something.
<SpringStingray> Earn money for discoveries, building award winning rockets and having partnerships
<OtakuTom> So the endgame of a planet in Spore, but better?
<Chocobunny> And then we will have fun.
<SpringStingray> OtakuTom: YESH
<FlaschenJoe11> What did I just see while entering?
<SpringStingray> Except not space ships, more rockets
<Chocobunny> Spacestage of spore was fun.
<Chocobunny> I hate how many people say it is boring.
<d3rb> its science FlaschenJoe11
<FlaschenJoe11> The giant rocket danced like it was made of noodles
<SpringStingray> Chocobunny: Second stage and Space Stage were the best
<Chocobunny> SpringStingray: My favourite stages were cell, creature,civilization and space.
<Chocobunny> I hate tribal.
<alexxm> what was so bad about the tribal stage
<SpringStingray> Tribal was one of my least liked
<SpringStingray> Nothing really happened
<Chocobunny> Other than the Grox stealing my people.
<SpringStingray> Hot a what?

<Meanwhile> C-c-combo breaker.
<Liokin-Bot> Eulshy: Its a fun game. Your a giant robot. You have to keep your kid safe or you die. Simple as that :3
<killerpony7733> Liokin-Bot: Hiya bro /)
<Liokin-Bot> killerpony7733: Sup bro /)
<MadSurge> It's a shame the internet spoiled the big twist of the first game long before I played it :(
<SpringStingray> I didn't see much about the first game
<SpringStingray> I didn't even know there was a twist
<MegaMoonShine> I got the demo for the first one once
<MadSurge> SpringStingray: there's one, but I'm not telling :)
<Eulshy> Alright im trying to keep track
<SpringStingray> MadSurge: That's ok, I'm not boverelled :p
<Eulshy> bbut wtf?
<Meanwhile> Ded.
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Phase4> 00,02batman arkham asylum

<Phase4> 00,02:<
<SpringStingray> Phase4: GOD DAMN WINDOWS LIVE GAMES
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Fail. :/
<MegaMoonShine> U srs? :|
*Major pats Phase4 on the back "There there..."
<Phase4> 00,02its not even multiplayer
<MadSurge> Eulshy: Welcome to Rapture, a dreamcity made under the sea allegedly without a government.
<Eulshy> fun
<MegaMoonShine> Dat music
<Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin> oh if only Nittany was awake Phase4 ,he'd definetly have somethng to say
<MadSurge> Eulshy: things went to shit when they found a seaslug that secerned "Adam", a substance that enhances human brain and faculties and gives superpowers
<SpringStingray> Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin: I'm silently dyign over Windows Live Games
<Eulshy> again, fun
<MadSurge> Eulshy: It is a fun game in fact
<Liokin-Bot> Phase4: -lol did you pirate it??
<Phase4> 00,02Liokin-Bot, nope
<Phase4> 00,02it was cheap on steam
<Liokin-Bot> Phase4: If not just get the code from the box you bought it from. :3
<Phase4> 00,02and i've heard its epic good
<Eulshy> Break that window
<Liokin-Bot> Phase4: Ohhh. You need a product key?
<Phase4> 00,02Liokin-Bot, steam copy comes with code :P
<SpringStingray> Wait, it's on Steam, but still requires a Windows Live?
<Liokin-Bot> Phase4: Then just make a windows live account and save >:3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03HEY!
<MadSurge> Eulshy: also, long exposure to Adam makes you go insane and addicted. It became so bad they started using modifying little girls to recycle Adam from corpses
<Phase4> 00,02wow, i am very impresed by its engine
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I thought you were going to sleep, Phase-y >: (
<Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin> it is Phase4 best Batman game ever, not counting Arkham City
<Liokin-Bot> Phase4: I had the same issue with Lost Planet 2
<Phase4> 00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, not yet :P
<Eulshy> okay now it's kinda freaky
<Liokin-Bot> Eulshy: -lol wait till you find big brother
<Liokin-Bot> Eulshy: Little sisters arent so bad. :3
<Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin> Scoot-Scootaloo: its only like 10pm where Phase4 is, he's not a child
<Eulshy> Games i haven't played
<Phase4> 00,02allmost 11
<Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin> Phase4: 10:58 then
<alexxm> this was a good game
<MadSurge> Eulshy: and they gave them big robot things called "big daddy" to protect them. The protagonist of Bioshock 2 is the first successful prototype of these
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ah, he usually goes to sleep at this hour :S
<SpringStingray> alexxm: And then what haoppened?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Or maybe I'm just imagining things~
<alexxm> SpringStingray it still is
<ashka> yay, ordered a tab to draw ponies
<ashka> :D
<SpringStingray> alexxm: Then why saw "was"
<Eulshy> Again, games i haven't played confuse me the most
<MadSurge> ashka: Nice! What tablet?
<alexxm> SpringStingray i don't know
*Eulshy Inserts ticket
<SpringStingray> :p
<SpringStingray> You got me confused
<alexxm> sorry
<ashka> MadSurge: a trust slimline
<ashka> I have a friend which had that for 4 years, not a single scratch
<MadSurge> Nice!
<ashka> (it's 15x20 cm)
<SpringStingray> That's a sizeable tablet
<Meanwhile> Would you kindly knock the snot out of that Big daddy?
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: :D
<MadSurge> DED
<SpringStingray> He was one tough nut
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah!
<MadSurge> ashka: you can't post videolinks. Imagelinks are fine (unless it's movie night)
<ashka> oh okay
<Lil_B> I Stabbed and I cut...
<MegaMoonShine> O____________0
<Lil_B> ... the melon in 8 Parts
<ashka> here's a nice art http://obisam.deviantart.com/art/My-Little-Mane6-314984668
<MadSurge> ashka: for videolinks, you have to wait until there's no stream
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03How come no one harvests the little sisters? :\
<ashka> I see
<SpringStingray> Because that's heartless?
<Meanwhile> Blood sploicers.
<MadSurge> Scoot-Scootaloo: it's a loss of Adam on the long run
<Meanwhile> No hang on, in this one it's Splacers.
<MadSurge> DED
<Meanwhile> And he goes down to a golf club.
<alexxm> well that was quick
<Eulshy> i should get my blanket from the freezer
<Cypresswolf|Work> Scoot, I think that because its harder to be good in this game
<SpringStingray> Eulshy: You and your Summer :p
<MaxTheBrony> Heya guys :)
<MadSurge> The drill bumrush is the best attack in this game :D
<Eulshy> it'shooooooooooooot
<SpringStingray> It's COOOOOOLLLLD
<Liokin-Bot> -lol its adorable in a strange way cause theres this big robot thing walking around murdering people with an adorable little girl kicking her feet back and forth on his shoulder :3
<Eulshy> lucky yooooooooooooooooooou
<SpringStingray> my tootsies are freeeeeeezing
<MadSurge> Liokin-Bot: he'll murder you only if you menace the girl/directly attack him, so he's not too dangerous
<Phase4> 00,02wow, arkham asylum has incredibly fluid combat
<MadSurge> Phase4: it's a good game :)
<SpringStingray> Phase4: I heard that people were having issues with it, being glitchy
<MadSurge> OH COME ON
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02aparently its using the unreal engine
<Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin> just remember Phase4 don't button mash let it flow through you, don't rush and you'll be a master at complete combos
<Liokin-Bot> MadSurge: Its adorable really. Like if I carried aound sweetie belle while she leeched off of other corpses and I murdered other ponies. It seems psychtic. In a fatherly way :3
<Phase4> 00,02did not think it was capable of that but whatever
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Many games uses it
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin, i figured that quick :)
<Liokin-Bot> Psychotic*
<MadSurge> Liokin-Bot: yeah, it's creepy but also cute :D
<Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin> :) never shoulda doubted ya Phase4
<Liokin-Bot> MadSurge: I mean look at her shes just a tot :D
<Derpdash> Hey im back everypony! Who's streaming?
<MadSurge> Liokin-Bot: even the ones from the first game were cute, if not a little more creepy
<MadSurge> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Eulshy> Mmmm freezer blanket
<SpringStingray> Eulshy: When you're done with it send it here, might be warm once it arrives
<Liokin-Bot> MadSurge: -lol omg she even raises her hand like a little foal like she is saying "Up up" thats too cute -lol XD
<Liokin-Bot> hands*
<TheRandomkid321> Judging by this time One of my guesses for streamers would probably be Phase4 But I cannot see his OC anywhere so chanches are it isnt him.
<MegaMoonShine> Hey Derpdash :)
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, its Wrek
<TheRandomkid321> Okay
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: it's Wrek!
<Eulshy> meow
<Eulshy> its meow
<Derpdash> Hey MegaMoonShine
*Liokin-Bot pets Eulshy
*Eulshy Purrs
<TheRandomkid321> Bioshock 2... I have always wnated a minecraft map of that city.
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: it's a great game :)
<MegaMoonShine> TheRandomkid321: That... would be GENIUS! :O
<Thrackerzod> Hello everyone
<TheRandomkid321> Is Bioshock infinite ay good... It seems odd since it is set int he scy and not the sea
<Thrackerzod> DED
<Liokin-Bot> Thrackerzod: Sup bro /)
<MegaMoonShine> TheRandomkid321: It's not out yet
<MadSurge> ^
<TheRandomkid321> MegaMoonSHine Oh. Well id otn follow Bioshock.
<TheRandomkid321> *dont
<Thrackerzod> Liokin-Bot hey (\
<MegaMoonShine> TheRandomkid321: I don't either :D
<MadSurge> MR BUBBLES, NOOOO :'(
<TheRandomkid321> But it seems like a fun enough series
<Thrackerzod> ded
<TheRandomkid321> STory seems confusing though.
<MadSurge> Oh come on Wrek, melee the fuck out of him|
<TheRandomkid321> PIKACHUUU!
<Eulshy> Rape him?
<Thrackerzod> ded
<Thrackerzod> XD
<TheRandomkid321> WHy do you keep picking up that little... Thing!? Pedo much?
<mario_kitten> lol
<MegaMoonShine> >.>
<Liokin-Bot> TheRandomkid321: -lol it be his babeh! >:3
<Kandarihu> I have $16.13 left in my Steam Wallet, and not sure what to buy.
<Thrackerzod> TheRandomkid321 : its for a mission he has to protect her while she gathers adam
<Eulshy> Kandarihu: Buy me stuff
<TheRandomkid321> Today I found a secret minecraft 360 skin pack. Well not really secret but it not very known.
<Thrackerzod> GtheRandomkid321 grats
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: alternatively you can kill her to gather a lot of Adam right away, but in the long run it's a net loss
<TheRandomkid321> Are there any whale in game? Like you see from windows? Well by whales I also mean Collosal sea creatures in general.
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: no, but the Big Daddies sound like whales :D
<TheRandomkid321> madSurge That's good then. I get terrified of collosal sea creatures even if they dont look scary... So you could imagine what happened in that HL2 scene where the teleporter is malfunctioning...
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: still haven't played that one :|
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge it's in the first five minutes
<MadSurge> Yeah Wrek, that's the drill! Melee them all! :D
<killerpony7733> ^What a pun
<TheRandomkid321> I like this 50's music
<alexxm> 50s music makes everything creepier
<TheRandomkid321> :D
<Eulshy> Now i suddenly want my ;ower half warm, but my top half cold
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: *rimshot*
<TheRandomkid321> alexxm I think the oppisite
<Liokin-Bot> TheRandomkid321: Makes me want to play fallout -lol
<Eulshy> that turret really helps
<Kandarihu> See? Fallout doesn't have the monopoly on '50s music.
<TheRandomkid321> WHAT IS THAT GIRL THI NG DOING WITH THE CORPSE!?
<alexxm> taking adam from it
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> shes eating it!and then shes gonna eat me!
<MegaMoonShine> Oh my goooooooooooooooooooood! :O
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: -lol nooo shes like a mosquito :3
<TheRandomkid321> alexxm Adam? I have never played Bioshock before kay.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: i hate mosquitos >: (
<Eulshy> this game seems hard
<alexxm> ok then TheRandomkid321 it powers the stuff like lightning attacks
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: So you hagte small foals is what your saying?
<TheRandomkid321> Mosquito bites you... EAT IT! Take back what is yours!
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: So let me ask you this....
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Do you like bananas?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> TheRandomkid321: with interest!
<Eulshy> seems like a hard game
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: that may be possible, but to answer your question, ill ask this: do You like mmmbananas?
<TheRandomkid321> Seven eyes? Seven Horns? (if ya know what I mean)
<MegaMoonShine> O_____0
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> TheRandomkid321: wow, sounds horny
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: no no no so your a beeyatch...that likes mmmmmbananas??? right? *reaxches into bananana bag..
<Eulshy> Hard game is hard
*twi_sprinkle_GS17 quick draws a banana bag and presses the buttong before Liokin-Bot
<Kandarihu> twi_sprinkle_GS17, I'm alright with bananas. I don't love them and I don't hate them. It's cool
<MadSurge> Eulshy: it's more like Wrek always forgets to melee people :D
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Kandarihu: well thats good, then you wont miss them, ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
*Liokin-Bot "Well ill tell you were you can figure out your bananan love" presses button "ON THE MOOON"
<MadSurge> What would Celestia say if someone responded "meh"?
<Liokin-Bot> come come now little one. Thats enough draining blood :3
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> MadSurge: depends on her mood. the only thing that can really stop her is lack of banana bags
<TheRandomkid321> I am going to waste 70 dollars on this! https://content.ebgames.com.au/website/images/detail/157663_detail_v2.jpg BECASUE IDGAF!
<TheRandomkid321> Chat derp? Or has BIRDEMIC come!?

<TheRandomkid321> GOD! I am BEHIND! Brb REFRESHIN!
<Eulshy> Doesn't matter
<TheRandomkid321> By like 5 minutes
<MaxTheBrony> Heya everybrony :)
<Liokin-Bot> MaxTheBrony: Sup bro /)
<Sx963> hello~
<TheRandomkid321> Hello MAX!
<MegaMoonShine> Heya MaxTheBrony :)
<MaxTheBrony> Liokin-Bot: (\ sup :)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> hoi MaxTheBrony
<TheRandomkid321> OH SHOOP! I should have ben in bed AN HOUR AGO!
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<TheRandomkid321> Gtg everyone
<Sx963> see ya XD
<MaxTheBrony> Bye TheRandomkid321 :) Cya
<Eulshy> i fink i might fall asleep watching the stream
<Liokin-Bot> Ah hell.....alarm...
<MadSurge> ALAAAAARM-never happened :D
<Sx963> hey i assume it's brony64 streaming, what's he playing?
<Liokin-Bot> Sx963: Wrek
<MegaMoonShine> Sx963: Nope, wrek. And he's playing Bioshock 2
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Sx963: qrek is playing bioshock 2
<killerpony7733> ^What he said
<killerpony7733> they*
<Sx963> okay okay got it thanks XD
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> he be trippin
<MadSurge> TOO MUCH ALCOHOOOL
<Eulshy> That turret
<Sx963> i remember being genuinely bewildered when a friend tried to explain the story behind bioshock.
<Eulshy> Fings are dark and i cant see anyfing
<MadSurge> Sx963: it's a weird story ainnit
<alexxm> well nightmare fuel always work
<MadSurge> ^
<MadSurge> So quiet
<MegaMoonShine> O_______0
<MadSurge> JERK WREK :'(
<alexxm> why would you do that
<Eulshy> did he kill her...?
<MegaMoonShine> EEEEEEEEEVIL!
<MadSurge> LESS ADAM FOR YOU
*MadSurge considers only good endings canon
<Eulshy> ?
<MadSurge> Eulshy: yes he did
<Eulshy> awww
<Eulshy> the little girl was kinda cute looking
<MadSurge> Eulshy: that gives you immediately more Adam, but if you rescue them they give you extra Adam and powers that in the long run gives you more :)
<MadSurge> In the form of wrapped gifts, no less
<Eulshy> so, why did he kill her then, the latter option seems better in the long run
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> well wrek is rather impatient, that or maybe he didnt know that he could ignore the objective
<MadSurge> Maybe because it's not immediate, the manual just tells you "you get less adam if you rescue them"
<Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin> http://derpiboo.ru/53782 Und dann I killed the chat... with D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
<MegaMoonShine> X.X
<MadSurge> O__O that's one huge horn
<killerpony7733> Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin: Pffff try harder i got a heart of titanium
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i have no heart
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> *squidwardface*
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> how many times can you respawn?
<killerpony7733> Infinite
<alexxm> as many times as you need to
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> is there a downside?
<alexxm> nope
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: You cant die technically.
<alexxm> or if there is i forget it
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Achievements
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: not really, but it makes dying less threatening
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Some things have to be killed on first encounter for achievements. But aside from that no.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> wow, not often you see a game with godmode legitly
<killerpony7733> It's not godmode per say, But darn close
<MadSurge> ^
<MadSurge> Dying is still a hassle though
<killerpony7733> Atleast it doesn't give you a full on all ammo and the stuff again each time,
<MadSurge> ^
<MegaMoonShine> ^^
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> how does the game explain the respawning?
<alexxm> respawn chambers i think
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: reviving chambers
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> interesting
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Little sister take you there.
<MadSurge> The glowy tubes that function as checkpoints
<killerpony7733> uh no the things remake or repair someone who has a matching DNA that it says that is allowed to use it
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot:was that the girl he killed?
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yup. But theres more than one.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> so many siblings
<killerpony7733> Actually they aren't related any of them
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: The bugs are in several of them.
<MadSurge> Did he pick hard mode? O__o
<killerpony7733> Just pheromones that keeps them linked
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: bugs? those adam things?
<SirGanjalf> hello everypony
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yeah they just all are infected.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> hoi SirGanjalf
<MegaMoonShine> hello SirGanjalf :)
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Saw the little leech thing you crushed when you tore it out of ittle sister?
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Thats the bug.
<Liokin-Bot> SirGanjalf: Sup bro /)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: sounds like a fun world :P
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: too much Adam splices your brain and psyche into a mess
<SirGanjalf> LightTrooper105: (\
<SirGanjalf> Bioshock 2?
<MadSurge> Yep
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> SirGanjalf: si seniore
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: -lol well it should bring some comfort to you that you have ""Siblings" Who have your back :3
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: yeah, blood-sucking sibling ._. i wouldnt give her a piggy-back ride..
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: She will never hurt you. Because she wubs you :3 and thats no joke -lol your siblings really do care for you.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: ..and then you kill em :P
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: But you have to hurt her or eventually the adam will corrupt her and she will go nuts.
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: she only gets them from dead people, and Big Daddies aren't dead :D
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> MadSurge: are big daddies guys in suits?
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yup.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: are they human?
<MaxTheBrony> They are prisoners arent they?
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yup.
<MaxTheBrony> Forced to be in the suit
<MaxTheBrony> Or am i thinking space marines now xD
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: The suits bind them to the little sisters.
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: conditioned into being unstoppable monsters that protect little sisters
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> wow
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> such a weird game
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: But YOUR specific little sister you can never kill her you have to protect her. Because your linked. If she dies you will die.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> how do you even come up with this stuff
<MaxTheBrony> Fantasy ^^
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: spiritual successor to System Shock
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Well isnt this basically love in a nutshell? When you love something enough you kill for it >:3
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> one more question-whats the objective of the game?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> plot-wise
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Find your little sister and protect her forever :3
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: love is evil ._.
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: this game? Find your old little sister and bring her out of Rapture
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: If you dont find her your suit will shut down and you will die. Theres a life support system in the suit that keeps you alive.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: and you cant take it off?
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: LIFE SUPPORT
<MaxTheBrony> twi_sprinkle_GS17: i dont think so
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: If you take it off your body will fail
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: the protagonist is the first big daddy.
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Heart shut down lungs everything
<Eulshy> falling asleep
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> hm k, thx for explaining teh crazyness :P
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<MaxTheBrony> This game does have a lack of ponies tho dont you agree?
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: See how the other big daddy wont attack you when un provoked? Its cause he is your brother :3
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: you should try the first, it explains all about the city
<killerpony7733> Hey now not everything needs ponies,
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Liokin-Bot> MaxTheBrony: Yes it needs ponies.
<killerpony7733> Ponies 24/7 will really bore you in the end
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: wat a relationship :P
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> MadSurge: eh too much bloody murder for me
<MaxTheBrony> killerpony7733: True :) but now im in a pony mood so ^^
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: I see :(
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: -lol hey if it makes you feel any better. If I was a big daddy and you were my little brother. I would not kill you :)
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Liokin-Bot: yay ._.
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: Obviously, I just stick with the show and some pony related stuff to satisfy the need
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: -lawl
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> the other big brothers dont have life chambers?
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Nope
<killerpony7733> I really like wreks persistence
<Liokin-Bot> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Your a special one.
<killerpony7733> He just keeps on trying
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> killerpony7733: well, he is immortal pretty much :P

<Bronysith> megusta... http://www.deviantart.com/#/d58emp1
<Wrek> 05so far: the infinite respawns are silly. the hard difficulty is also silly. its not hard jsut repetitive sicne it was made with the infinite respawn in mind. guns and combat feel good except for soem sounds. aiming redcules are also silly.

<Chrysalis> hey
<Saturn> 08,01yo
<SirGanjalf> Chrysalis: The Portal 2 blog labeled it Wheatley, but as many of you are no doubt itching to point out in the comments section, the "in spaaaaaace" quote actually comes from the Space Core. Observant gamers, however, will note that the core depicted on the panel actually has Wheatley's distinctive circular "pupil" rather than the Space Core's hoop-shaped one.
<alexxm> how've you been Chrysalis
<SirGanjalf> so, yeah, who knows?

<derpy_pony> such a stream chat is ideal for a live let's play...we should do this one day

<TheKoreanBrony1354> TheKoreanBrony1354
<alexxm> so what now
<derpy_pony> the internet has accepted the pony master race. no more wars
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<derpy_pony> I accidentially bronified half my politics board
<Derpdash> What game is this and who's streaming?
<String_Shredder> derpy_pony: ew, politics
<Kandarihu> derpy_pony, cool
<derpy_pony> it's fun if you keep the idiots, partisans and narcissists out
<alexxm> is that good derpy_pony
<derpy_pony> I think it is
<String_Shredder> that sounds really hard to do, derpy_pony. Today it seems thatm everybody's corrupted.
<alexxm> well congrats on doing that then derpy_pony
<Bronysith> hotdiggedydemon
<derpy_pony> gtg, later :)
<Derpdash> What game is this?
<Bronysith> Derpdash: fluffly rainbows 2
<Wrek> 05Bronysith: behave
<Wrek> 05Derpdash: its SPAZ
<Derpdash> Oh ok thanks Wrek
<Derpdash> and lol Bronysith
<Barbetos|Atwork> ANyone here play ThreadSpace: Hyperbol?
<Bronysith> sorry
<shana> space pirates and zombies oO
<String_Shredder> Bronysith: I hinestly prefer Fluffy Rainbows 1 over the sequel.
<shana> sounds like firefly :D
<String_Shredder> *Honestly
<Bronysith> the rainbows were fluffier in the first one String_Shredder
*twi_sprinkle_GS17 slaps Bronysith for lying about the game name
<Hrafn> I approve of fluffy things
*Bronysith dodges twi_sprinkle_GS17 s lame excuse of a slap
*twi_sprinkle_GS17 watches as Bronysith stumbles onto the mine he planted
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> boom.
*Bronysith deactivates the mine before it boomed
*Bronysith eats the mine
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: youll still die for eating a mine, your stomach wont digest metal
<Bronysith> i have a lead belly perk
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> hey Bronysith have you heard...skyrim is better than morrowind
<killerpony7733> ^That is a pure lie,
<Bronysith> yup
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: your lie is bad and you should feel bad
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: tis the truth!
<killerpony7733> Most of the games before skyrim was generally better
<Bronysith> most?
<killerpony7733> Yeah, To about oblivion
<Bronysith> oblivion was great
<Bronysith> i loved it
<killerpony7733> Oblivion was good and stuff, Though morrowind and what not beat it by comparison
<Bronysith> well yea
<Bronysith> morrowind is alot less friendly....
<killerpony7733> Oblivion is better when compared to skyrim
<Bronysith> YES
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> skyrim is the king of all games in history
<Kandarihu> I'm kind of eyeing Fallout 3 GoTY edition, but Steam says it's not optimized for Windows 7. How much of a problem is this going to be?
<killerpony7733> Skyrim was a right step towards many game mechanics but not story wise and partially it's world
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> its best game in all the omniverses
<Bronysith> but teh combat in morrowind could be touched up killerpony7733
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: Yeah the fact you actually miss a point blank swing?, Thats where oblivion and skyrim do it right
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: i wonder if there is a mod for morrowind to touch up the combat though
<alexxm> compeutor derped had to restart it
<killerpony7733> Most likely is modding community was big for it i believe
<Bronysith> i heard there was an ak47 mod
<Bronysith> megusta
<killerpony7733> Oh god the gun mods for some of the TOS games
<Kandarihu> killerpony7733, you mean TES?
<killerpony7733> right,
<killerpony7733> :D
<Bronysith> i like morrowind cause you actually have to read where to go
<Bronysith> instead of hte almighty arrow to tell you where to go
<Bronysith> but it works in a game like fallout cause you ahve a futuristic device strapped to your arm
<killerpony7733> Yeah a very well done and immersing mechanic
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> reading on a monitor is bad for your eyes
<Bronysith> and no quick travel in morrowind. unless you take a boat or stilt strider
<Kandarihu> Guys, how "Not Optimized for Windows 7" is Fallout 3?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> its not like youre force to use quicktravel
<killerpony7733> Yep, Though for fallout 3 and FONV it can be understood
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: again
<Bronysith> futuristic high tech device on your arm
<Bronysith> i like how in morrowind you can be ambushed while resting
<Kandarihu> Dangit! I'm thinking of buying Fallout 3 GotY Edition, but I'm worried it might not work on my computer.
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: Same goes with fallout 1 and 2 during travel
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: i still need to play those
<Bronysith> still getting used to the combat system of those games
<Bronysith> but right now morrowind, new vegas and dead island have my attention
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: Seriously meeting a group of mutants or a patrol of ENCLAVE was god damn scary as a low ish level with no powerful weapons
<Kandarihu> I'mSorry. I'm not supposed to ask more than once. It's harrassment.
<red_ony> hey Bronysith How far into Morrowind are you? First time playthrough?
<Bronysith> yes
<Bronysith> first time play through
<red_ony> :)
<Bronysith> im working on thieves guild questline
<Bronysith> then ill do the main quest
<killerpony7733> Wait you can get a awesome waifu through that quest line Bronysith
<alexxm> hows that going fo r you Bronysith
<Bronysith> alexxm: oh it is fun, the stealing in that game is very interesting
<alexxm> Bronysith how's it intresting?
<Bronysith> it is not easy
<red_ony> I can only recommend you get morrowind expanded graphic mod and better bodies, better heads mod :)
<red_ony> to update the graphics a bit :)
<Bronysith> well i am going to play dead island right now
<Bronysith> fucking steam sales
<red_ony> :D have fun
<Kandarihu> The $20 I put into my Steam is basically the $20 I'd have put it at the beginning of the month. I wanted to do it early to get in on the Steam Sale
<Cypresswolf|Work> whats going on in the stream now?
<rdash> ^
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf|Work, Space Pirates & Zombies
<rdash> was about to ask the same thing...
<Cypresswolf|Work> :) I was close - thinking Space Invaders
<shana> Kandarihu: 'not optimized for window7' basically means 'you might have to tweak some settings and do some googling'
<rdash> Kandarihu: yeah, I don't recognize this game at all...
<MadSurge> Yaaay, Bridle Gossip in italian! It was cute :)
<Cypresswolf|Work> doing paperwork today - may or may not have to haunt a jobsite later

<killerpony7733> Check rules FAQ and stuff
<Bambi> rdash: This is the chat that generally has no relation to what's streaming, and half the time, nothing is streaming! Have fun here ^^
<Barbetos|Atwork> Its like 2.49 right now

<rdash> thanks Scoot-Scootaloo ;) I've been in here a couple times before, very briefely, but it was quiet like now...
<rdash> never really knew what was going on...
<shana> rdash: basically we chat here and watch stuff on the stream (games, movies, cartoons, webcam footage, music, etc)
<Barbetos|Atwork> Kandarihu actually I should say that no one plays. =\
<Bambi> shana: you missed out drawing, it is too popular to be in the etc. category!
<shana> probably could do a s/webcam footage/saturn life ^_^
<Kandarihu> Barbetos|Atwork, did you talk to Nittany_Discord (LOVE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) about this?
