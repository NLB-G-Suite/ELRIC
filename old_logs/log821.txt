<BroPony|ENGI> just...hiding
<twilight_sprinkle> for flutterfans http://soapie-solar.deviantart.com/art/Winter-s-Day-344881022
<legendary_brony> yes
<legendary_brony> HHHHHNNNNNGGGG
<Bronysith> flutterfags make up 90% of the fandom
<BroPony|ENGI> legendary_brony: you havnt seen HRNG yet
<MLP_Brovakiin> Nah, AJ is where it's at :3
<BroPony|ENGI> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: nah, i think there's more twilight fans, she usually has a bit of an advantage on polls
<legendary_brony> so your insulting 90% of bronies
<DerpyMuffins> How about something for Twilight fans?
<BroPony|ENGI> http://25.media.tumblr.com/6510ba2dc23bafce828ccd7c82e512af/tumblr_mfiwqm3yM01r1059xo1_500.gif

<legendary_brony> *head exploted*
<thelonecubone> BroPony|ENGI: can i have more apple frwitters?
<twilight_sprinkle> im just going through the last drawfriend
<Spell-of-Gaming> Twilight is the main character, though. :c
<legendary_brony> i ma going to draw my thing
<Spell-of-Gaming> There should be more polls that are, "Who is the best pony EXCEPT Twilight Sparkle?"
<Spell-of-Gaming> And some idiot manages to find a way to add Twilight Sparkle onto the choices.
*aniderp|bestcakeever falls asleep
<twilight_sprinkle> Spell-of-Gaming: because she is always best pony, even when ineligible :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> Twilight is most likely going to get most tropes
<BroPony|ENGI> i dont have a favorite pony
<BroPony|ENGI> i love them all
<BroPony|ENGI> equally
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is there a trope where "the main character is loved by most of the fandom"

<Stormy> I keep telling this to another person who always does that
<ThunderBreeze> That awful because i can't do anything without having stomach pain
<Stormy> If you want us to talk, come up with a subject
<Stormy> we're probably just idle because there's nothing to talk about right now
<legendary_brony> ....
<legendary_brony> *whistles*
<taoumi> o/`` racist barn raceist barn 1 2 3 4 o/``
<legendary_brony> 1234
<Spyrofan001> 6What do u guys want to talk about?
<Shizuka> 13in the absence of anything to contribute, bronies parrot the misheard lyrics of the previous episode
<BarbetosMyBananas> sai waaaaat?
<taoumi> eeeyup
<taoumi> it totaly sound like racist barn though :D
<Shizuka> 13no it didn't, it sounded like "raise this barn"
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<taoumi> well maybe to you Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13but our culture has degraded so much that people need to find inappropriate references in absolutely everything
<taoumi> mhmm
<Vordox> >.>
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> >_>
<Vordox> <_< Christmas Blows
<pot80> And here was me thinking it came from a pony thread sim fad
<legendary_brony> waht!
<Afflict> time to bring out the random topic generator
<taoumi> lol wat
<Brad__> and we are not all staring at the chat constantly, we are doing other stuff.
<BarbetosMyBananas> Meh. I wouldnn't take it that way. I doubt anyone even really knows what a racist barn is or what it means.
<pot80> you say what as a statement, not a question so I'm not sure how to interpret
<Vivix> saying: What. is common though
<BarbetosMyBananas> When I looked it up, some one compared a "racist barn" to an atypical barn. Kind of like WW2 propaganda against hitler, or the japanese.
<taoumi> wat is a statement. a statement of i don't even
<Vivix> yes, that
<Unnr> Shizuka: Of course, this assumes that this culture ever had a height to degrade from...
<pot80> Vivix: Yes but usually followed by a question mark to show it as a question
<Vivix> but it's not a questin in that case
<pot80> I know
<Vivix> usually it's emphasized by a punctuation rather than a question mark-
<pot80> I know
<Vivix> Then it is not usually followed by a questionmark
<Spyrofan001> 6What do u guys think about ducks?
<Vivix> as far raise this barn, I think it's too awkward to try to make it sound like racist barn because of the last syllable
<legendary_brony> IM. SO. BORED.
<pot80> I was just saying I did not know which way I should have interpreted the statement. Should I have expected a description of this what or just seen it as a statement of bamboozelment
<Vivix> but people have always done that, just look at malformed christmas song, it's nothing to whine about
<JRP2234|Zzz> SuperBrony64
<Afflict> ducks are awesome
<Vivix> songs*
<pot80> I'm not whining
<Vivix> not you, silly
<pot80> Oops
*Vivix strokes
<pot80> I'm too caught up in this post talk
<Vivix> post talk?
<pot80> *posh
<Vivix> aah
<Afflict> hey Neo
<Vivix> now everything sounds like Rarity in my head
<BarbetosMyBananas> Here is the comment I was talking about earlier, with link. "To me, the barn appears to have similar qualities to old, racist war propaganda. Here's an example: www.deutsche-schutzgebiete.de/webpages/Kriegs propagandaka... This is in no way to imply that I'm racist (I'm far from it), it simply caught my attention." sorry for the test wall.
<pot80> Great I ruin it with dreadfull spelling just as I approached the end of my dramatisation
<BarbetosMyBananas> text*
<Ponies47> Hey guys
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Ponies47
<Vivix> hiya
<pot80> Hey Ponies47
<pot80> how you doin?
<Neotyguy40> Hi
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Ponies47 ^-^
<thelonecubone> Hi Ponies47 :)
<BarbetosMyBananas> That comment is a great example though, in comparison to the song lyrics being the way they are. It was simply a matter of perspective, meant to be humorous. I wouldn't think on it to much.
<Vivix> myes, I can't hear it, but it doesn't bother me
<BarbetosMyBananas> I hear it only becuase it makes me laugh.
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> k question why doesn't Spyro beat up the pirates who capture him?
<JRP2234> wheres SuperBrony64
<JRP2234> GOD DAM IT MISSED HIM AAGIN
<Afflict> no clue
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> he should of falcon punched them
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> and ran away
<Stormy> because it was convenient for the plot that he didn't
<BarbetosMyBananas> He was never here.
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> still
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> stupid
<Stormy> in other words, lazy writing :P
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> oh great
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> lazy writing
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> hence why moleyair got caught
<Vivix> Ever
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> why not exhumor?
<MLP_Brovakiin> He is most likely serching pictures of funny cats on the internet listening to the sound of frollicking cows
<MLP_Brovakiin> *frollocking
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> he wasn't caught
<Stormy> I actually don't remember much about that game
<Stormy> so I can't help you there
<Stormy> :P
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> also why pirates?
<MLP_Brovakiin> *searching
<MLP_Brovakiin> >.>
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> they dont serve a purpose
<Stormy> so they could do a flying pirate ship level? Dunno
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> ugh krome studios
<Afflict> yeah they do
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> ur lazy
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> what purpose afflict?
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> other than they're the same enemies
<BarbetosMyBananas> wurds*
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> as the apes
<MLP_Brovakiin> *potato
<thelonecubone> :O

<thelonecubone> oh
<BarbetosMyBananas> I have never used this games benchmark
<BarbetosMyBananas> Oh wait. Yeah I have.
<pot80> The hd quality :O
<Afflict> Maybe they used them so they could have that level with all the floating ships?
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> yeah
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> also blundertails arent hard
<Afflict> Don't know if it was significant to the story though
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> as every1 thinks
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> they're easy
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> compared to executioner
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> and ravage rider
<pot80> Woooo shit is blowing up!
<shizumobile> Splosions: The Game
<Dark_Horst> BarbetosMyBananas: there's a hole in your link

<donutpop365> Well, I got a lock picking set :D
<Username> Nice
<donutpop365> As well as a teensy HID 3.0.
<Dark_Horst> my only gripe with this game is the lack of indoor areas
<Stormy> You missed a couple people :P
<BarbetosMyBananas> Sprint? I just grapple hook everywhere
<thelonecubone> donutpop365: well, welcome to the theives Guild >:3
<thelonecubone> thieves*

<Shizuka> 13music working?
<Dark_Horst> ya'll should see the final mission. no, i wont tell ya
<Dark_Horst> no music here
<Conyst> no on the music
<Username> Missiles everywhere and no music
<Shizuka> 13oh winamp screwed up again
<Dark_Horst> now it is
<Conyst> there we go
<Panda> I hear something.
<GilDash> Acid is better than bleach for getting rid of bodies anyway. >_>
<Shizuka> 13oh that's annoying...
<Shizuka> 13no winamp control while in game...
<Shizuka> 13oh well
<Panda> GilDash, just like all that chloriform? ;)
<Conyst> daaahh
<GilDash> Panda: I don't no nothing about that. <_<
<Sumica> 00,10no media control on fancy g15 keyboard Shizuka?
<Panda> Hm... I can has skype logs?
<Dark_Horst> got a g110. works
<Dark_Horst> before that, i had a g11
<Dark_Horst> worked too
<Dark_Horst> i miss my g11
<GilDash> G11... that's an experimental gun, isn't it?
<Panda> uh.... huh.
<Username> Yeah
<Dark_Horst> when it broke i wanted to get the same one. but scumbag logitech had stopped making it
<Username> and a keyboard
<GilDash> Fires caseless ammunition, I beleive.
<Sumica> 00,10cousin lets go bowling
<Dark_Horst> GilDash: heckler and koch, yes
<twilight_sprinkl|afk> dem physics
*AdamTheDuck throws his logic out the window
<twilight_sprinkl|afk> RUBBER CAAAAARRRR
<GilDash> Similar design to the P90, where the ammunition is loaded in 'sideways' and is turned to fire forwards.
<Conyst> It just shoots the entire bullet casing and all
<rd1985> sup
<Username> That more bullet per shot
<Dark_Horst> Conyst: caseless ammo has no casing
<GilDash> Conyst: Pretty much. It's "caseless ammunition."
<AdamTheDuck> That's 40% more bullet per bullet
*thelonecubone jumps out to feed on AdamTheDuck's Logic
<GilDash> Conyst: So technically speaking, there is no casing.
<rd1985> i buckin love this game
<pony_455467> hi!
<AdamTheDuck> Hello pony_455467
<thelonecubone> Ohai pony_455467
<Dark_Horst> also had this nifty recoil-absorbing barrel
<Username> Hello
<Dark_Horst> it would firre a three bullet burst and only recoil with the last bullet
<Panda> Wonder if the buggati is in this game.
<rd1985> talk about reckless
<Dark_Horst> they threw the rifle though
<Phase4> destructible trees?
<Dark_Horst> to much heat
<Username> I think it also uses a rail for ammo feeding, like the p90
<Phase4> what is this i don't even
<Sumica> 00,10rubber carrrrrr
<Dark_Horst> difficult maintenance
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, welcome to Just Cause 2
<Panda> "Crazy damn pedestrians." Uh...
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, please leave your logic and IQ beside the door when you enter.
<Phase4> Panda, to be fair they were on the sidewalk in a city with this guy around
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, NO :<
<Conyst> I know this game more as Josh Cause
<wipergone2> hi
<GilDash> Dark_Horst: Wasn't that because it fired so fast? Or am I thinking of metalstorm now?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai wipergone2
<rd1985> hi
<Panda> Very true, Phase4. And I see you are naked.... why?
<Dark_Horst> GilDash: metal storm is something entirely different
<Username> Josh Cause sounds great
<GilDash> Dark_Horst: No, I know that. I meant the "three shots, one recoil" bit.
<AdamTheDuck> Panda, Phase is always nekked 'cause he's a rebel
<rd1985> stop hangin carians
<Panda> Well that was mean.

<Petrified_Discord> So fab
<Panda> They would... what.
<twilight_sprinkl|afk> Phase4: daaaahling, you look faaabulous~
<Conyst> and he has no cause
<GilDash> Phase4: Who are you? Jason in his technicolour dreamcoat?
<AdamTheDuck> Dayum Phase4, why you so fabulous?
<thelonecubone> Phase4: nice colors~
<rd1985> oh no
<Dark_Horst> GilDash: metal storm does that by igniting three bullets at the same time. the g11 had a sliding barrel
<Panda> Something tells me shizu likes bondage.
<Panda> Kidding....
<Phase4> inb4 kick
<Panda> yup
<Sumica> 00,10ohdear
<Petrified_Discord> Oh look. A bus.

<Scoot-Scootaloo> Buses are LMG
<thelonecubone> prepare the Shizubus
<Petrified_Discord> Drive bus. Chaos +50.
<Barbetos> dat stunt
<DerpyMuffins> Bus don't fly silly
<Sumica> 00,10shizubusslines
<Dark_Horst> GilDash: the force would get absorbed by the spring until the barrel hits the back of the gun with the last bullet
<thelonecubone> Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo :)
<GilDash> Dark_Horst: Aye, but it was electronically fired, so it could actually fire 3 bullets so quickly the recoil didn't have time to affect you until they had been fired.
<Stormy> -_-
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Also, Happy Kwanzaa, everyone!
<Barbetos> She was just.. Hanging... Out?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo :P

<GilDash> You know, GTA was funny with the no friction thing, but this is funny *unmodded*.
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkl|afk: the game makes a poitn of "fuck physics, we got boom"
<Panda> Heel flip.
<Pepper> what is the objective you know the point of this game..
<twilight_sprinkl|afk> GilDash: yeah but this isnt as priceless as the no-friction in gta
<Petrified_Discord> So, um...where are alll the other cars? :/
<Sumica> 00,10out of gas

<Panda> These VA's
<Petrified_Discord> Silly informant. Americans are not tigers.
<JRP2234> cachi01|scribblenaut
<GilDash> The main character's VA is average. Everyone elsee is silly-stupid. XD
<twilight_sprinkl|afk> GilDash: yeah i remember a perfect no-friction moment in one of the vids, i hope i can find it and post here at some point, its just a must-see
<Dark_Horst> i'm pretty sure all these panauan voicesa re meant to be bad too
*wipergone2 slaps JRP2234 with a large trout
<GilDash> It's like they picked random people off the street and said, "You! Want to be a VA?!"
<Pepper> i would be surprised if that car exploded

<Dark_Horst> exaggeration
<Pepper> or was i.... nope
<the_real_pony_1604v2> WHAT?!?!?
<Pepper> OMG
<Gatamer> That noise
<Dark_Horst> being ridiculous is the whole point of this game. you notice that by how, for example, the health of bikes drastically decrease after ejecting so they can blow up as soon as they hit soemthing
<Pepper> XD get him!
<Sumica> 00,10ow
<the_real_pony_1604v2> did he just jump from 10 floors up, onto the roof of a car, not only not die but also cause no damage to the car
<rd1985> i hate that song

<Wrek> 05now each tiem i managed to beat oen and steal his gun
<Wrek> 05they never worked
<legendary_brony> dat car
<Petrified_Discord> It's times like these that make me wish criminals would take more of a parachuting rocket launcher wielding approach rather than simple robbery.
<texasboykc09> Wrek, ok?
<Wrek> 05so i kept geting gunless
<GilDash> Wrek: Who gave you this information? >_>
<Sumica> 00,10clearly the gun had one of those iff's on it wrek

<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Fingerprint protected triggers?
<Pepper> OMG
<Wrek> 05on a a deagle? on a 1911 colt?
<the_real_pony_1604v2> That’s because real agents use their bodies as weapons. Guns are just for intimidation
<Wrek> 05puh-lease xD
<Conyst> we must now steal a plane
<Dark_Horst> i once had a dream involving a very peculiar p90. it could shoot all fine and well. then there was that guy wo wouldnt be harmed by it. so i went "welp, looks like i need more boom". i then turned the gun around and fired from it's butt. that blew up half the town
<legendary_brony> this car sucks *sees a the same car but not damaged* now thats morelike it
<Pepper> what the...

<Pepper> whenever i added pepper he always added salt..
<legendary_brony> except bronies because an episode came out the next day so they refused to believe it would end

<rd1985> ya
<cachi01|scribblenaut> im a tiny baby!

*Bronysith takes Fenrir away <3
<cachi01|scribblenaut> Mike|Led_Zeppelin: objection. so far every wii U game is awesome
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> cachi01|scribblenaut: Will you be playing them a year after you get them?
<cachi01|scribblenaut> yes
<Fenrir> Mike|Led_Zeppelin: For kids? It's already got Assassins Creed 3, Darksiders 2 and Monster Hunter 3 is coming out on it
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> cachi01|scribblenaut: because that's how I am with every game I want.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I love these new nicknames peopleare going by! SOO MLG <3
<Kandarihu> SaxyPretender, indeed. And then they made Twilight Princess too.
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Fenrir: Is it toned down? or full game?
<Fenrir> Mike|Led_Zeppelin: Full game
<cachi01|scribblenaut> Fenrir: full game
<cachi01|scribblenaut> Mike|Led_Zeppelin*
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Fenrir: Hmmm
<Bronysith> Majoras mask>ocarina of time
<Fenrir> ^
<Bronysith> period
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> I might have to play this before I jump to conclusions then.
<Bronysith> end of story

<Gatamer> later
*Bronysith glares at cachi01|scribblenaut
<cachi01|scribblenaut> wind waker > oot > majoras mask
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Bronysith: BLASPHEMY
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> NOTHING BEATS OoT
<Fenrir> OoT was okay, but it was very story limited
<Bronysith> cachi01|scribblenaut: false, OOT made zelda possible for 3d, majoras mask is my favorite though
<Fenrir> Every character has a story to follow in Majoras Mask
<cachi01|scribblenaut> kill anyone you want with a chainsaw or whatever you feel like
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Fenrir: If you look deeper, there's more. It wasn't all up front about it.
<cachi01|scribblenaut> rated E for everyone
<cachi01|scribblenaut> i love scribblenauts :3
<eli> hmm
<thelonecubone|skyrim> cachi01|scribblenaut: still funny
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Fenrir: By that I mean in MM, the stories were easy to follow. In OoT, you had to look.

<cachi01|scribblenaut> Cypresswolf: mountani dew did a contest to name their new soda
<cachi01|scribblenaut> Cypresswolf: 4chan went to the rescue

<cachi01|scribblenaut> Cypresswolf: http://hypervocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/leaderboard.jpg

<twilight_sprinkle> i think it was dub
<mitamaking> What did they choose?
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> twilight_sprinkle: It was a code that voted asmany times as possible with as many IPs as possible
<cachi01|scribblenaut> Cypresswolf: and this is how it ended http://www.manolith.com/files/2012/08/mountain-dew-4chan.jpg

<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> jcelios: I know
<Bronysith> Mike|Led_Zeppelin: ahh yes, the daily "i want to $%$ inside of (pony name here)" thread
<jcelios> :>
<LadyCanary> Wait...
<DerpyMuffins> I'm still not used to Phase4 being a mod
<LadyCanary> This sound familiar
<jcelios> :<*
<jcelios> lol
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Bronysith: We do not speaketh of that here
<LadyCanary> OMG
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Octavia
<thelonecubone> DerpyMuffins: how so?
<LadyCanary> Well it's been a while since I've heard the Beatles!
<Bronysith> indeed
<DerpyMuffins> I've always seen Phase4 as a techy
<Cypresswolf> :3 sounds like beach music to me *dances around chair with drink in hand*
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> LadyCanary: Do you not listen to things you like?
*Phase4 will always be a techy at heart
<LadyCanary> I listen to things I like.
<LadyCanary> But I havent actually had a good long listen to the Beatles in a bit
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> LadyCanary: ah
*Bronysith casts agilao on Phase4 and suplexes him
<Bronysith> yay~
<thelonecubone> DerpyMuffins: He's still a Techy, Just that he's now Promoted
<DerpyMuffins> Umm Wrek, where is her bow gonna go?
<Bronysith> DerpyMuffins: in her hoof silly
<Cypresswolf> I'm glad its midnight and everyone is asleep or I'd look pretty foolish right now :P
<thelonecubone> DerpyMuffins: and he's open to new commands
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> That position is incredibly inefficient.
<DerpyMuffins> That has to be the best trolling Cello ever
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> DerpyMuffins: It's a bass, not a cello
<Bronysith> inb4 flame shit war
<DerpyMuffins> Not this again....
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Cello vs Bass war is a go.
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> brb
<DerpyMuffins> I'm just not gonna even start
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I just call it a "big string thing"
*Bronysith hides in vault 4324
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Wait, nv
<Phase4> i prefer Cello because i prefer the way it sounds, 'Bass' is a bleh word
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> I am thoroughly mistaken
<Bronysith> no...
<Phase4> though i think the canon is that it's a Bass
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> it seems that a cello has 4 strings.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SaxyPretender it's obviously an oversized Ukulele
<SaxyPretender> 0,14indeed
<Phase4> ^
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> I was thinking of a Viol, which has six.
<Bronysith> Mike|Led_Zeppelin: you do realize you contradicted the internet right?
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> It's a cello.
<Phase4> i think the fandom is over the cello vs bass war
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<thelonecubone> ^^
<DerpyMuffins> Although the end piece is too short
<Conyst> plus it's clearly a trombone<_<
<thelonecubone> oh, blachi is gone ;3;
<Phase4> Conyst, clearly
<ouo> http://dagobah.net/flash/my_little_destiny_generator.swf
<DerpyMuffins> Unless it's not even pulled out
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> If it were a bass, then the body would be larger than her.
<Phase4> isnt dagobah where luke went to find yoda?
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Due to mathemetized pony sizes
<DerpyMuffins> I think Obi said Dagobah system
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, Phase4
<thelonecubone> Phase4: yes
<ouo> thought same then i first was here
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Systems in star wars are named after the most prominent planet
<Phase4> so
<Phase4> how bout them ponies?
<Conyst> so
*Bronysith glompels Phase4
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Phase4: Totally overrated
*Phase4 hugs Bronysith back
<DerpyMuffins> I hope Wrek knows what an actual Cello looks like
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Now it's all about the Pocket Whales
<thelonecubone> DerpyMuffins, let the Artist do his work
<thelonecubone> :P
<Conyst> Is this Rhapsody that's being played?
<DerpyMuffins> Is that Vinyl on the other side?
<Bronysith> DerpyMuffins: shush or the imminent myriad truths will get to you
<Wrek> 05DerpyMuffins: what, my current placeholder isnt adequate? :o
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, looks like
<thelonecubone> Conyst: look at the bottom left
<DerpyMuffins> Sorry Wrek, just my OCD acting up
<Conyst> doh me
<Conyst> didn't even see that
<LadyCanary> Excellent power metal I must say
<ouo> http://dagobah.net/flash/know_your_destiny.swf - origin of this generator
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Wrek: It seems that the neck of the cello is in a rather odd position.
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, so you note the cello design and not the fact that wrek seems to be detailing things that will be obscured by it?
*Phase4 casts LOGIC
<DerpyMuffins> Obscuring?
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Phase4: Being a music nut like me changes your train of thought
<Conyst> There is no logic only Zuul.
<DerpyMuffins> The Cello is doing all the obscuring
<Phase4> s/Zull/Pinkie Pie/
*Bronysith holds Conyst by his ankles
<Conyst> Help they have my ankles!

<LadyCanary> Dont worry. its just Sith.

<KrazyNoobs> Mike: Redundant sentence is redundant
<Shizuka> 13as though 4chan produces anything original
<Scoot-Scootaloo> >Reddit
<Scoot-Scootaloo> >original
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Shizuka: 4chan creates 90% of internet trends
<Buytoast> did someone say...
<Buytoast> REDDIT?
<thelonecubone|Halo3> yes, Buytoast
<Shizuka> 134chan also creates 90% of crap
<Buytoast> how horrifying
<KrazyNoobs> 4chan is the reason for most memes
<ouo> crap == internet trends
<Shizuka> 134chan is the reason the general public fears the internet
<Buytoast> that's mostly /b/
<KrazyNoobs> Shizuka: I cannot disagree.
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Shizuka: What abou Rtten.om
<Shizuka> 13the rest of 4chan has sure done a lot to distance themselves from the cesspit that is /b/
<KrazyNoobs> My fav boards are /v/, /co/, /b/ and, of course, /mlp/
<Shizuka> 13oh wait, no they haven't
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> *Rotten.com
<Buytoast> not saying they aint
<Buytoast> just saying /b/ is what usually comes to people's minds

<LadyCanary> The relevance of those images.
<ouo> Bronysith so true
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/ZcN8I.jpg
<KrazyNoobs> 4chan makes the best memes, and then 2 months after 4chan hates them, the rest of the internet follows along.
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Bronysith: That is older than it's filetype
<KrazyNoobs> Except the whole bronynet got tired of gak in the first 2 commercials.
<thelonecubone> Bronysith: :D
<Mike|Led_Zeppelin> Bronysith: It's artifacts hurt my eyes
<LadyCanary> Wreky, when you get the chance, if you dont mind, could you play Gamma Ray? If you cant thats okay ^^"
<KrazyNoobs> Bronysith: to the fb idiots: You're leaving this planet, I'm staying!

<Phase4> 00,02videos are k then
<ThunderBreeze> No there's not so i guess you are more tolerent right?
<legendary_brony> no but earlier there was no stem and i got yelled at
<legendary_brony> *steam
<SpeccyRush> *stream
<RoboGerbil> legendary_brony: theres a difference when a stream is running and when one isnt
<legendary_brony> *STREAM
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.bronystate.net/rules/ well the rules are non-image links during streams
<SpeccyRush> and by the way legendary_brony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmgcjRu1s-8
<Phase4> 00,02it's lightly enforced, i tend to be more lax about it, but still a rule
<RoboGerbil> also note that the mods will kick you for whatever whenever anyway
<ThunderBreeze> I've got a kick the first time i posted a video during a stream so.
<Wrek> 05RoboGerbil: only if you're a twat :3
<RoboGerbil> gak
<RoboGerbil> 0.o
<legendary_brony> im not lying earlier someone yelled at me for putting a video whe there were no steam

<Phase4> 00,02seems like
<JRP2234> hmm
<JRP2234> g/-\k
<JRP2234> yesh
<Phase4> 00,02ThunderBreeze, the gist of the rules is don't be a jerk, anything else is a slap on the wrist (ie: kick) and we keep having fun
<legendary_brony> dont mine at night
<Wrek> 05someone try a lenny please

<legendary_brony> its not easy making 'good' stuff
<NocturnalBlade> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1tAYmMjLdY listening to this
<Heated> What is this slideshow about? or is it just random
<Buytoast> but apparently it's pretty easy to make garbage
<legendary_brony> it takes dedication and lots of hard work
<Buytoast> you know, since that video was a prime example
<legendary_brony> its better than what you would make
<CrystalPhoenix> Alright now for Non-stop climax mode
<sub06905|GBA> they still havent released children of the night i see
<sub06905|GBA> :I
<CrystalPhoenix> I had fun in Hard despite the difficulty so it shouldn't be too bad
<CrystalPhoenix> wait what?
<CrystalPhoenix> no Witch Time?
<Heated> If you don't like the video hen why are you wathcing it?
<legendary_brony> yeah
<Buytoast> it doesn't have to be better than anything i'd make

<legendary_brony> you have no good taste
<CrystalPhoenix> Rap battles are mediocre
<CrystalPhoenix> for simple laugh
<thelonecubone> ^^

<KrazyNoobs> I hate LPS because MLP only had 13 episodes because of it. :(
<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCrLMwDz5qE
<CrystalPhoenix> If you force yourself to like something you won't be critical and if you're not critical you'll sugar-coat the artist which will lead the guy to not improve
<Heated> How do you chnge tsxt color?
<KrazyNoobs> I hope Littlest Pet Shop doesn't go into a second season. If it doesn't, we may have 26 episodes in Season 4
<sub06905|GBA> mods only
<CrystalPhoenix> KrazyNoobs, actually MLP now has almost 62 episode up
<pony_666> anypony see that discords spose to be in episode 10

<pony_666> what>
<pony_666> ??
<Heated> I don't care how many episodes they're are as long as they are good I'll watch i.
<KrazyNoobs> What I mean is, Hasbro made them do 13 of LPS and 13 of MLP instead of 26 of MLP... at least if the 13 episodes are of better quality, its good.
<Buytoast> is that...
<Buytoast> A RULE VIOLATION?
<Wrek> 05pony_666: have you read our rules or FAQ?
<Mr_Kopple> no...
<CrystalPhoenix> KrazyNoobs, and I mean that you have enough MLP episode to enjoy the series
<Mr_Kopple> look out man
<Heated> Quality over quntity?
<KrazyNoobs> pony_666 YOu ruined everything for me.
<CrystalPhoenix> be lucky they actually give 13 new episode

<sub06905|GBA> KrazyNoobs, no t0 eps in
<sub06905|GBA> wait
<legendary_brony> what
<sub06905|GBA> :P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> what
<TamaRuhi> KrazyNoobs: wait? how come?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dont say that
<Mr_Kopple> im off see ya
<KrazyNoobs> They want to shorten the wait for the 4th season
<legendary_brony> why
<legendary_brony> sooooo.....
<KrazyNoobs> They should have made a 2 week interval between each episode so we would only have to wait 6 months instead of 8...
<CrystalPhoenix> KrazyNoobs, will you die when MLPFiM is over?
<RoboGerbil> you know the more new ponies they make, the more merchandise they can sell
<legendary_brony> they are making wait longer
<Kimori> me
<sub06905|GBA> so wait is the new episode coming up the 9th episode?
<Kimori> probably will be up another half hour, whats up?
<KrazyNoobs> CrystalPhoenix: MLP:FiM will never be over. If DHX Media and The Hub discontinue it, the bronies will still make their own episodes
<Afflict> nothing much, you?
<sub06905|GBA> !cd
<Tom> Episode 10 of season 3 "Spike at Your Service" airs in 2 days, 7 hours, 53 minutes, 52 seconds (Dec 29 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<AdamTheDuck> Did I miss anything while I was away? .-.
<CrystalPhoenix> KrazyNoobs, you're delusional
<Jmo> Nope, just a bunch of shit.
<legendary_brony> if ponies dint exist= boring old life
<Imadolphin> Hi everypony
<Kimori> was doing more unpacking today
<legendary_brony> hi
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Imadolphin
<thelonecubone> Hi Imadolphin
<Conyst> hello Imadolphin
<legendary_brony> are you a dophin?
<CrystalPhoenix> they cannot run new MLP episode forever, they will run out of ideas.
<Conyst> clearly yes
<sub06905|GBA> AdamTheDuck, depends were you here during the mod battle?
<legendary_brony> stop lying
<NocturnalBlade> ohai Imadolphin ^_^
<AdamTheDuck> sub06905|GBA, indeed I was
<Conyst> Just as I am a Conyst.
<Afflict> ah good
<sub06905|GBA> i prefer they end the show at a certain point so that we wont have shitty episodes
<KrazyNoobs> MLP:FiM will not be ending anytime soon, either. The Hub has gone from $350,000 per annum in 2011 to $37 million per annum in 2012, and now is the 8th most popular channel in America. MLP is responsible for well over half of this, so The Hub would not allow MLP:FiM to end. Plus, DHX Media wouldn't do that to our amazing fandom... even Hasbro would care, because they would lose money.
<AdamTheDuck> tl;dr
<thelonecubone> sub06905|GBA: agreed
<Jmo> 'amazing fandom' I lol'd
<KrazyNoobs> Although Hasbro is stupid... they would cancel G4 and make an all new G5 that is just like G3.5, and expect all of us to like it...
<sub06905|GBA> G4.5? anyone?
<sub06905|GBA> :P
<KrazyNoobs> Jmo: IS our fandom not amazing?
*aniderp|bestcakeever is dead floating in water
<Kimori> I really want it to be done already :/
<Jmo> It's horrible.
<Kimori> feels like its taking me months to finish
*RoboGerbil pokes aniderp|bestcakeever with a stick
<sub06905|GBA> every fandom thinks they're a grat fandom
<sub06905|GBA> great*
*KrazyNoobs throws a rock at Jmo
*JRP2234 slaps SuperBrony64 around a bit with a large trout
<KrazyNoobs> :D
<Afflict> Hopefully when you're done you can just relax
<KrazyNoobs> The chat, once again, has come to a standstill.
*Conyst stands on chat
*KrazyNoobs throws seaponies at the chat
<Conyst> It's not moving so I am safe
<CrystalPhoenix> But yeah I'll tip my hat to the guy that plays Bayonetta at Non-Stop Climax mode
*KrazyNoobs makes
*KrazyNoobs the chat
*KrazyNoobs move
*KrazyNoobs a little
<DaringDerpy> too much

<twilight_sprinkle> btw tf2 soldier rocket launcher physics are wrong
<Ponies47> I could play PS2 with them but I don't know how to play PS2 so I would just screw everything up XD
<thelonecubone> KrazyNoobs: if this was halo 3, you would've seen elites running around :3
<twilight_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: this is planetside 2, aka ps2
<KrazyNoobs> Never heard of it
<KrazyNoobs> Never seen Halo before either
<thelonecubone> D:
<KrazyNoobs> The only First Person shooter game I have every played is TF2.
<thelonecubone> you have not played PS2 nor halo?
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl
<thelonecubone> blasphemy D:
<twilight_sprinkle> physics are getting back at phaes
<RoboGerbil> lol it spawns upside down
<thelonecubone> Ponies47: and cus, this is a MMOFPS game
<thelonecubone> you'll get shot easily
<thelonecubone> depending where you spawn of course
<twilight_sprinkle> this game looks to slow to me
<twilight_sprinkle> *too
<twilight_sprinkle> walk for 20 minutes, get killed in 1
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: think of this game as TF2 but open world
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonecubone: nah its not tf2 at all
<thelonecubone> true
<AdamTheDuck> It's Battlefield in a sci fi open world
<RoboGerbil> hes only walking 20 mins cuz hes not spawning on the frontline
<AdamTheDuck> Now I shall resume doing science with Phase!

<Sanic_Rainbloom> WTTTTTTF
<XAX> science created windows 8
<eraykaan> (portal 2)
<Kazur> if you want science play Castlevania 64!
<XAX> i think sanic rainboom thinks all the theaters play different things
<XAX> if there were enough staff, that might be possible :p
<Ponies47> Yup
<eraykaan> Kazur: no. I'm talking about aperture science
<XAX> or
<XAX> they could embed a synctube playlist on one of them
<Kazur> And im talking about TOWER OF SCIENCE
<XAX> full of pone
<XAX> but they probably won't want to do that.
<eraykaan> Kazur: Rule 1#. Never question the pinkie logic
<Kazur> I think the streamr is slightly confused
<AdamTheDuck> For science!
<Kazur> This game is really boring if you dont have a team of friends on skype or something

<Gold_Demona> I do every once in a great while.
<KrazyNoobs> Kritzberg is 1 scrap
<KrazyNoobs> I used the nametag to call it "Strange Medigun", and he thought he was getting a rare item for a cheap price
<Jmo> So you scammed a child who obviously did not have full knowledge of what the trade consisted entirely.
<Jmo> You must feel so good about yourself.
<Jmo> Bravo.
<KrazyNoobs> He was crying on his mic whenever he died, he saw it coming.
<Wrek> 05And people wonder why peopel are assholes
<texasboykc09> ikr
<KrazyNoobs> I just don't think kids should use their mics
<AdamTheDuck> Just mute them >.>
<KrazyNoobs> He was using his big brother's account anyway
<AdamTheDuck> Is it that hard?
<KrazyNoobs> LOL
<Jmo> Mate, the point still stands.
<Jmo> You did wrong on your part.
<KrazyNoobs> I'm sorry I talked about it

<KrazyNoobs> To donate to my server, it is normally 8 keys per priviledge, so I gave him two priviledges, if that makes you feel better.
<Gold_Demona> If you're only doing this so we like you more, that's just sad. You should be doing it for your own conscience, not us.
<KrazyNoobs> I am
<KrazyNoobs> I don't care what you think
<Buytoast> The sins that stain your slate of life cannot be cleansed.
<KrazyNoobs> I just thought I should have given him something back

I asked him to give back the Kritzberg for the 2keys, although none of you witness me doing it, there was so much pressure applied to me. Forgive for doing it and mentioning it, now I have some 6 year old with admin priviledges.

<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 i did now add me
<KrazyNoobs> I've worked hard to be part of this community, but if I'm an admin on the TF2 server anyway, people automatically respect me, so I did what was right.
<JRP2234> been waiting 3 days
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: I will o3o
<Gold_Demona> If you hadn't scammed the kid in the FIRST place, KrazyNoobs, you wouldn't be IN this pickle.

<KrazyNoobs> Neither would I have been if I kept my mouth shut in the first place.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 den we play blops2
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: Awesome :D
<KrazyNoobs> I did everything, everyone on my server hates me, let's leave it at that. The kid has his metal + 16 key worth of admin priviledges, I ain't giving no more.

<texasboykc09> Havok, KrazyNoobs scammed a kid
<Havok> oh lulz

<KrazyNoobs> Havok: I scammed this annoying little kid, I was stupid enough to boast about it here, everyone raging against me, I overdo what I give back to him just so that everyone here will stop raging at me, people still hating on me on my own server.
<Jmo> Shut up and move on now.
<KrazyNoobs> I'm not going to revoke those priviledges anyway
<KrazyNoobs> He's having fun with them
<PoniesAsleep47> Point is you fixed it
<KrazyNoobs> And yes, Jmo, that would be a good idea.
<Havok> Idunno why
<KrazyNoobs> And I lost 16 keys.
<PoniesAsleep47> Drop the subject
<texasboykc09> PoniesAsleep47, you still here

<KrazyNoobs> PonyFan10154: There are strict rules here, trolls get banned, so we have none of them around.
<tak025> i never playd that game
<Lil_B> hello people :)
<Kandarihu> PonyFan10154, I suppose it seems like that should be a given rule, but not really.
<Phase4> XD
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Lil_B! :)
<PonyFan10154> ahh Trolls
<tak025> hi Lil_b:)

<Lil_B> oh, the lottery newpaper arrived
<Lil_B> and I forgot again which B Movie I wanted to enter >.<
<PonyFan10154> Anyone else have this Desktop pony thing?
<tak025> :P
<Gold_Demona> I do
<PonyFan10154> Yeah it slows down your computer a little bit though
<tak025> PonyFan10154 what?
<Lil_B> I have it but I don't use it
<Gold_Demona> I don't really see a difference in speed on my computer
<PonyFan10154> its this think I got from a youtube video where you can have ponies walking, flying, doing stuff on your desktop
<PonyFan10154> just to tak who dosen't know
<tak025> oh
<PonyFan10154> Yeah it's sweet
<tak025> we can put links here?
<Phase4> 270 damage XD
<Gold_Demona> I have my OC in my Desktop Ponies, so I sometimes have her walking around my screen. =)
<tak025> or the rules...
<Phase4> from one shot
<Lil_B> Well, it's 13:37 here... time to leet
<Phase4> tak025, image links yes
<Eli> Phase4: i have a 350+ ping -_-
<PonyFan10154> woah he talks
<tak025> oh okay ty
<Kandarihu> tak025, if a stream is going on, you can only do image links.
<KrazyNoobs> Gold_Demona: :)
<Phase4> Eli, sucks don't it :P
<Invoker> I have 193 ping lol
<Phase4> high ping is a problem with high speeds
<tak025> well ill read the rules
<PonyFan10154> SO if phase like a creator or something?
*Lil_B is now vacuuming
<Phase4> 400hp scout
<KrazyNoobs> tak025: That would be a good idea. It will be helpful
<tak025> no trolls i like that rule:)
<KrazyNoobs> tak025: Well... I am a troll on other places, but not here. They should change that to "no trolling"
<KrazyNoobs> And yes, I think that is a great rule.
<tak025> of course :P
<Kandarihu> You know what? I might honestly be one of the last Americans to profess to be "into" First-Person-Shooters, but out of 59 entries in my Steam Libary, 24 of them ARE FPSes.
<tak025> well gtg
<KrazyNoobs> It makes this place better, as other places are raided constantly by haters.
<tak025> bye everypony
<KrazyNoobs> Bye tak025.
<tak025> yeah u have reason
<tak025> cya all:)
<KrazyNoobs> cya!
<Gold_Demona> We get the occasional troublemaker looking to stir something up, but I like to have fun with those. =)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye tak025 :)
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight BronyState :P
<Gold_Demona> Night Ducky
<KrazyNoobs> Night AdamTheDuck
<Kandarihu> And yet of the 24 items in my Wishlist, only 3 of them are FPSes (Guns of Icarus, Fallout 3 and Fallout NV
<Kandarihu> )
<KrazyNoobs> I remember when I used to troll here . I am glad that changed, I enjoy being a part of this sub-community.
<KrazyNoobs> Plus, everyone is nice here
<Gold_Demona> We have our moments. :P
<KrazyNoobs> Gold_Demona: Yeah, kind of like an hour and a half ago, and sometimes, a few here argue about stupid stuff.
<KrazyNoobs> Gold_Demona: Mod wars are the best
<Gold_Demona> I've not seen one of those on here.
<Kandarihu> What happened an hour and a half ago?
<Gold_Demona> If they do have any conflicts, I imagine they take it to private chat.
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: Best if you didn't ask =/
<KrazyNoobs> Kandarihu: I was stupid enough to blurt out that I scammed a little kid on TF2, and everyone was raging at me to give it back. I did, but the people on the server that I was an admin of started raging at me.
<Jmo> Just couldn't keep quiet you could you.
<KrazyNoobs> I decided I would do what the nice people wanted instead of what the people who already hated me wanted.
<KrazyNoobs> Jmo: Jeez, I'm not starting the whole thing up again. It's solved.
<KrazyNoobs> It's been solved.
<KrazyNoobs> The kid is on my friends list.
<KrazyNoobs> End of story
<Kandarihu> So you only got in trouble when you tried to make things right?
<KrazyNoobs> Kandarihu: No, I was being stupid.
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: He tried to make things right after we trounced on him for gloating about it. :P
<KrazyNoobs> And I regret everything I did.
<Phase4> cant hit a minisentry XD
<KrazyNoobs> Silence...
<Gold_Demona> chat died
*KrazyNoobs throws peanuts at the chat
*Gold_Demona noms peanuts
<Kandarihu> I notice that Phase4 seems to be ... I don't know, overstuffing his rocket-launcher and flying or something.
<Phase4> yup
*KrazyNoobs looks for large trout
*KrazyNoobs doesn't have one
*KrazyNoobs slaps chat with a small salmon
<Kandarihu> KrazyNoobs, my slap of choice is a large seapony.
<Phase4> no one pushing blue cart :/
<KrazyNoobs> Kandarihu: I used to have a seapony, but I threw one at the chat a few hours ago.
<Dark_Horst> whats that soundtrack?
<Kazur> Hai guiz
<Gold_Demona> I throw muffins! 8D
<Dark_Horst> kinda sounds like makkon

*KrazyNoobs throughs spoon at the chat
<KrazyNoobs> Well, that's all I've got.
<Phase4> weeeeeeeeeeee
<KrazyNoobs> Yay, someone said something!
<KrazyNoobs> Somewhere, an Engie just yelled, "SENTRY DOWN!"
<KrazyNoobs> Hate it when I am an engie and I built a Sentry, I am hiding somewhere near the sentry, in a VSH server. Hale comes by, takes 30 seconds to destroy the sentry without being blown back halfway across the map, and then the engie yells "SENTRY DOWN", and my hiding place is exposed.
<KrazyNoobs> i get keeld

<weylin|Blarg> bye aniderp

<Phase4> it's REALLY anoying
<Havok> time to run :D
<Havok> Cya later buddehs :3
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye Havok :)
<JunkerKun_> Heya, guys!
<wipergone2> XD
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai JunkerKun_ :)
<JunkerKun_> MLP_Brovakiin: Kinda silent here =/
<MLP_Brovakiin> I know right :I
<JunkerKun_> MLP_Brovakiin: So, how have ya been lately?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good thank you JunkerKun_, how've you been? :)
<JunkerKun_> MLP_Brovakiin: Not bad. Mostly. =)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good to hear :)
<Kandarihu> Hmm, to buy Super Meat Boy or not?
<MLP_Brovakiin> I love super meat boy :D
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: DO IT FILLY
<MLP_Brovakiin> I never completed it though, it made me rage >.>
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: Sure, buy it. It good
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: But be ready to scream "FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU" a lot
<JunkerKun_> And I mean A LOT
<tak025> lol
<Kandarihu> The thing is, I recently did a tally of my budget and found that if every game on my wishlist goes -75%, I'll have just enough money to cover everything. Now there's not much chance of everything on my wishlist getting that, though. But I really want to save up for a controller after this.
<Kandarihu> Also, Super Meat Boy isn't among the games on my wishlist.
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: Controller?
<Kandarihu> JunkerKun_, you know, an ad-hoc game input. SMB seems to be built for that.
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: You mean GamePad?
<Phase4> thankfully only chrome has implimented sdch so far
<Phase4> this spec is silly complicated
<Kandarihu> JunkerKun_, controllers are also called gamepads.
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: Well, I hear that name very rare lately. It is called gamepad or joystic more often, since mouse too can be called a controller as well as trackball
<Phase4> i don't like some of this spec
<Kandarihu> Well, looks like one more game on my wishlist is too much for my little laptop. So long Dark Souls. That game would've killed me worse than most people who try to survive in that game.
<Kandarihu> So fine. I'm buying Super Meat Boy, then.
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: Mhm. My friend tried to play Dark Souls. I've never heard anything from him anymore
<Kandarihu> JunkerKun_, the only reason I'm taking Dark Souls off of my wishlist is because it requires a better GPU than what my laptop has.
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: I sure hope yours is not integrated in MB
<CrystalPhoenix> So I've just read an AMA of TheZam, also known as the OP of the first episode thread in /co/ two years ago.
<Kandarihu> Alright. It's done. I bought the game, but I'm gonna have to wait to get home before I can install it.
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: Good luck. You will need it
<Kandarihu> JunkerKun_, I think I can be persistant enough to beat it. But I really would appreciate a controller for this.
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<Kandarihu> So I probably won't be playing this game right off the bat. I have lots of other games on my plate.
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: I don't know. I'm more comfortable to play it on keyboard. Perhaps just because I always played this kind of games on it =/
<JunkerKun_> DerpyMuffins: Hey
<DerpyMuffins> Hey Phase4 nice stream
<Kandarihu> Now that Dark Souls is off of my wishlist, the most expensive game that's still on there is Trackmania United. Not sure if that's gonna be -75%
<Kandarihu> Then again, a full franchise pack for Fallout would probably hit me harder at -75%
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: How much is it at your place?
<Kandarihu> JunkerKun_, how much is what?
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: Fallout pack. How much does it cost
<JunkerKun_> ?
<Kandarihu> JunkerKun_, if it were the entire franchise going -75%, it would cost $19.95
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: Interesting - I don't have Fallout franchise pack in Steam...
<JunkerKun_> Only full Bethesda pack
<Kandarihu> JunkerKun_, hmm, true. It's not here either. I guess I could just call it a franchise pack if all the fallout games go -75%
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: Ah, now I get it =) Well, chances are quite low. Sadly
<SlenderManWoods> wow, this is an awesome server
<Kandarihu> JunkerKun_, has New Vegas ever been -75% off before?
<JunkerKun_> Kandarihu: No, I don't believe so. Not sure about Ultimate edition though
<CrystalPhoenix> http://simchick.tumblr.com/post/37222022732/reports-from-sim-child-services
<BarbetosMyBananas> wat
<CrystalPhoenix> pinball machines
<male_writer> Hey everyone. :)
<BarbetosMyBananas> Are awesome.
<Invoker> theres so many pinball machines
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya male_writer :)
<male_writer> Yep, pinball machines are indeed awesome! A classic arcade game that will last forever.
<CrystalPhoenix> I need 30 pinball machines
<Alchemist> dammit, 3rd time I fell asleep in my chair today
<CrystalPhoenix> Alchemist, maybe you need to rest
<Kandarihu> Well, it's time to get packed up to head for home. The kitties are gonna be glad to see us, and they'll smell our folks' dogs, I hope.
<Alchemist> CrystalPhoenix: I do, but its only 4 pm here.
<Alchemist> I had a terrible night
<CrystalPhoenix> Alchemist, just lay down a couple of minute
<Alchemist> and still have shit to do
<CrystalPhoenix> I say just a couple of minutes
<Alchemist> maybe youre right
<CrystalPhoenix> I can't speak for anyone else but for me just laying down feels soooooo good sometimes
<Alchemist> screw it, brbr gonna take a 30 min nap
<CrystalPhoenix> so good that you'll be ready to do stuff in a manner of minutes
<male_writer> That is all I need when I get sleepy is 30 minutes, or even a couple of minutes.
<JunkerKun_> CrystalPhoenix: I did that one day. And then woke up in middle of night, while remembering that I layed down at 5 PM
<CrystalPhoenix> wow what did you do?
<CrystalPhoenix> I mean what did you do to be that tired?
<JunkerKun_> Um... sleeping only 4 hours per day
<JunkerKun_> Whole week
<CrystalPhoenix> dude
<CrystalPhoenix> that's bad
<male_writer> Oh, gosh, that isn't much sleep at all
<JunkerKun_> Yeah, I guess I have to sleep more
<DerpyMuffins> Did Phase4 crash?
<CrystalPhoenix> 6 hours would be understandable
<male_writer> But with all the sleep I get, I still feel tired around 12 to 2 in the afternoon everday.
<CrystalPhoenix> male_writer, overslept
<male_writer> indeed i do sometimes.
<CrystalPhoenix> it's also good to wake up early
<CrystalPhoenix> and have some good breakfast
<male_writer> well, yea, that is true.
<DerpyMuffins> HAha breakfast
<JunkerKun_> Pft. Overslept. I was oversleeping when after week like this woke up at 6PM
<DerpyMuffins> Haven't had breakfast in years
<male_writer> Waffles is my choice of breakfast most of the time
<JunkerKun_> male_writer: Nah. I like sandviches better
<male_writer> Well, yea, me too. My choice of a good breakfast sandwich PB&J
<JunkerKun_> male_writer: And...I like it with ham...
<JunkerKun_> And some hot sauce maybe...
<male_writer> oh, cool.
<DerpyMuffins> Hot sauce?
<male_writer> Also, I wanted to wake up so not to miss an episode of my new favorite show.
<DerpyMuffins> Time zones baby
<JunkerKun_> DerpyMuffins: Chilli sauce
<DerpyMuffins> It helps if you're in the right time zone
<male_writer> That is true.
<DerpyMuffins> The strangest sandwich I've had is avocado and PB
<male_writer> Well, my favorite sandwich with PB on it is PB and banana
<male_writer> you know, out of all the food I have tried, I never tried an avocado
<JunkerKun_> male_writer: me neither
<male_writer> oh, okay. But with me, I do like to try all sorts of foods.
<SpeccyRush> http://derpiboo.ru/194608
<DerpyMuffins> What do you write male_writer?
<male_writer> oh, right now I mainly write poetry, but also I am currently working on a story. i am stuck on Chapter Five though, I got Writer's Block for the time being
<male_writer> oh, love that SpeccyRush.
<DerpyMuffins> I suggest giving Fimfiction a visit
<male_writer> Fimfiction or fanfiction?
<BarbetosMyBananas> http://i.imgur.com/shdVa.jpg
<DerpyMuffins> Ethier or
<Kandarihu> Well, this is it. I'll see you next time mom and I stop off at a McDonalds.
<male_writer> Speaking of fanfiction, I have been thinking of writing a fanfic of MLP, but with my character from my story I am currently writing.
<DerpyMuffins> I would refrain from adding OC until you know what you are doing
<male_writer> Welcome back DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> My browser crashed
<male_writer> I know how that is.
<male_writer> Thank you for that advice though DerpyMuffins about writing a fanfic. :)
<Eli> male_writer: would taht make it a HIE story?
<DerpyMuffins> No one likes those
<DerpyMuffins> And I mean NO ONE
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: yyep
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: also hi. liked your last chapter ;)
<DerpyMuffins> Of?
<male_writer> oh, okay. Well, then I would have to exclude my character then.
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: the thought that counts
<DerpyMuffins> Oh
<DerpyMuffins> I need to get off my lazy butt and write the next chapter
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: tell me about it...
<male_writer> If I may be honest, I have just started watching MLP a week ago, but I have got hooked on it now! :D
<Eli> i'm like "oh i'm gonna be producitve today!2
<Eli> "
<Eli> and < happens
<DerpyMuffins> To be honest writing MLP isn't that easy
<male_writer> Oh, okay. Well, I thought about writing a fanfic of another show that I absolutely love, but haven't figured out how to do it
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: eh. i just write. so far no one noticed that i sliped up and used "hands" in once chapter, and i'm not corecting it until someone notices
<JunkerKun_> DerpyMuffins: Not harder than writing CDRR =D
<Eli> one*
<ekips> ohai everyone
<male_writer> Hi there ekips
<male_writer> So if i decide to write a fanfic of MLP, make sure it isn't HIE, right?
<DerpyMuffins> Yup
<DerpyMuffins> Or anything like MLD
<Eli> male_writer: just think of something original (no HIE/Alicorns/hatefic) and you will get nice results
<JunkerKun_> What is HIE anyway?
<Ninjazz> Naw. Just make sure it's nothign contrived.
<male_writer> oh, okay. Human in Equestria
<DerpyMuffins> Humans in Equestria
<JunkerKun_> Ah, got it
<male_writer> And just asking, what is MLD?
<ekips> extremists have occupied a school in my city this morning O.o
<JunkerKun_> ekips: wut? O_o
<Eli> male_writer: actually HIE is pretty popular with the younglings on fimfiction, but i think most smart ppl can't stand it
<DerpyMuffins> You wanna know what's funny?
<DerpyMuffins> I had filly Twilight abused and got a like for it
<ekips> they want to open an "alternative youth centre"
<male_writer> oh, okay Eli. Well, what if the human in the story is a young child?
<DerpyMuffins> Still no
<Ninjazz> Wait. It's going somewhere.
<JunkerKun_> ekips: alternative... what now?
<Eli> male_writer: ... it's still a human in equestira. and that's soooo G1
<male_writer> oh, okay.
<Ninjazz> If it's not a young man, it's already more original.
<ekips> of course their request was denied, in reaction they occupied a school
<Ninjazz> Children in equestria are BARELY done.
<ekips> JunkerKun_ a place where kids can meet and evolve and stuff
<Eli> Ninjazz: and then ship with mane6 or princess
<male_writer> I read some fanfics on fanfiction where the child is usually a girl, and i like them
<DoctoDoctorWho> Whats going on guy's?
<male_writer> Hi there DoctorDoctorWho
<Ninjazz> Eli, we're talking children here...right?
<DerpyMuffins> We talking about fictions
<JunkerKun_> ekips: eeeeeeer.... like... kindergarten? Or school maybe? I honestly don't get it.
<DerpyMuffins> I just wrote a christmas spoof and got 50 likes for it
<Eli> ProTip: male_writer. Be carefull with mane 6 ships. They have quite the personality, and you can fuck it up fast
<DerpyMuffins> I did
<JunkerKun_> DerpyMuffins: I just wrote an engine for my Pony horror game and got nothing for it T__T
<male_writer> oh, okay.
<ekips> JunkerKun_ A youth centre is a place where kids and adolescents can meet up in their freetime to do fun activities. It's self-organized, so there are no adults
<cachi01|scribblenaut> morning everypony :)
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: the story from you i'm actually reading, is alternate universe. tehre you have liberties
<DerpyMuffins> Hai cachi01|scribblenaut
<DoctoDoctorWho> Well Im not DOING a mane six ship! So ha!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good morning cachi01 :)
<male_writer> Well, like I started with my other show, I will maybe write a poem for each character of the show.
<ekips> JunkerKun_ we have tons of them here, but of course not led by extremists/fascists
<JunkerKun_> ekips: Oh. Still don't understand how is capturing school can help =/
<cachi01> JunkerKun_: ponny horror game? nice!
<cachi01> pony*
<cachi01> JunkerKun_: what is it going to be about?
<ekips> JunkerKun_ it's the extremist's form of expressing their oppinion
<Eli> cachi01: ponies. who would have guessed?
<Ninjazz> You know...It kinda frightens me that we've gotten to the point where thinking that HiE automatically assumes it's a guy in equestra trying to bang all the ponies. A child in Equestria actually kinda sounds good.
<cachi01> Eli: lel
<JunkerKun_> cachi01: About Twi exploring strange basement
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone read about the farmer who milks Rarity?
<Eli> Ninjazz: sorry, but finding a good HIE story, is like searching for the hay in the needle pile
<cachi01> what if the child tries to do so
<male_writer> Well, most of the HiE fanfics has the Human being portrayed as evil I think.
<Ninjazz> Which they should.
<DerpyMuffins> Humans=evil
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: came across it. didn't read.
<Ninjazz> Eli, that I'll agree with. I avoid them usually.
<DoctoDoctorWho> DerpyMuffins: D:
<male_writer> The reason I asked child though is because my character from my story I am writing is a young child.
<Ninjazz> Too much of the same.
<JunkerKun_> male_writer: Meh. In my oppinion humans are either extinct in MLP world or just don't exist at all
<male_writer> Very true JunkerKun_
<Eli> male_writer: that would be nice, but it's more like "oh human. so sexy." and all ponies run after him like flies a piece of shit.
<Eli> which is a pretty acurate description
<DerpyMuffins> Mary Sue=bad writing
<Eli> DerpyMuffins: that too. yes.
<JunkerKun> Eli: and then poor human is slowly dying under their hooves
<DoctoDoctorWho> DerpyMuffins: wait for it...
<Eli> JunkerKun: I wish.
<JunkerKun> Eli: Becoming more and more like a pancake on pan
<male_writer> There is one fanfic on fanfiction about a soldier who is in Equestria
<cachi01> lots
<DerpyMuffins> A word of advice
<DerpyMuffins> Don't sexually abuse a filly and you'll be fine
<JunkerKun> DerpyMuffins: riiiiiiiiight
<male_writer> There is one fanfic that touched me, and that was a fanfic about the CT shootings, it wasn't bad or anything, it was just the mane 6 talking to the people of CT
<JunkerKun> DerpyMuffins: Because a hoof to the jewels is just not good
<DerpyMuffins> I have read fics where that happen
<cachi01> i used to follow a HiE fanfic which i lvoed. but then he started shipping with twilight, RD and fluttershy
<DerpyMuffins> Eww
<cachi01> ikr
<male_writer> Well, if I do a HiE, if i do, I won't pair my character off with any of the ponies.
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone read Milking the Milkmare?
<JunkerKun> DerpyMuffins: Nope. Last thing I've read is Silent Ponyville 3
<Eli> male_writer: i don't read "media fics" like that. where something is portrayed that's popular in teh media right now.
<DerpyMuffins> It's exactly what the title implies
<DerpyMuffins> You milk a pony
<DerpyMuffins> MILK
<cachi01> DerpyMuffins: milkmare of trottingham?
<male_writer> oh, i don't blame you Eli. That fanfic though was touching, especially Rainbow Dash's part
<Eli> male_writer: actually i don't get why people do HIE at all...
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<Eli> a human in equestria, for whatever reason, it makes NO sense
<male_writer> Well, like I said, I will start out by writing a poem for each pony, like I have done with my other show.
<DerpyMuffins> MLD pushed it
<JunkerKun> Eli: Because they want to be there or maybe just... of, buck it, I don't know
<DoctoDoctorWho> MARY SUE INBOUND! http://web.archive.org/web/20070808050826/http://www.salon.com/comics/comics4961223.html
<DerpyMuffins> Really pushed it
<cachi01> overrated fanfic
<DerpyMuffins> male_writer Before you write ANYTHING go read Background Pony
<male_writer> I will tell you what pushed it DerpyMuffins, and it still haunts me, and that is the whole Cupcakes thing
<Eli> I recomend writing something nice, with mayve one or two background ponies
<cachi01> DoctoDoctorWho: 10/10 :D
<Eli> maybe
<DerpyMuffins> Cupcakes were ehh
<cachi01> why would cupcakes push HIE fanfics?
<DerpyMuffins> Not the most grimdark
<cachi01> cupcakes was funny
<cachi01> dem puns lol
<Eli> male_writer: i read cupcakes just a while ago. stayed away from the hype. now that i read it, i have to say, it's not even good...
<Ninjazz> male_writer: actually i don't get why people do HIE at all... <- It's usually for self gratification and wish fulfillment, I'm sure. Sure some do it nice but it usually always comes down to gettin' with the ponies instead of seeing the scenario without romance.
<Phase4> 00,02http://elslowmo.deviantart.com/art/Funny-Faces-342333995
<male_writer> The video Cupcakes though is scary.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Phase4: XD
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wait, are you saying that there pony/human ships in HIE fics? Impossible!
<cachi01> i <3 cupcakes HD
<cachi01> u better get ready to die:3
<Eli> DoctoDoctorWho: naah that ain't possible
<cachi01> Phase4: LOL
<Eli> cachi01: cupcakes 4D. now with real time knifes and blood
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronies would never do that >_><_<
<cachi01> Eli: i would watch that lol
<male_writer> However, there is a pony video that I love
<male_writer> The Ponies Anthology II
<Eli> male_writer: Saber?
<Eli> ah ok. thought saber made those.
<Eli> haven't seen it yet
<male_writer> oh, you haven't seen The Ponies Anthology II Eli?
<JunkerKun> male_writer: Meh, I liked first one more
<DoctoDoctorWho> Has anypony seen my own latest fic?
<cachi01> iirc saberspark is the one who made the anthologies
<Eli> enope. I love reading. not much into that stuff
<DerpyMuffins> I've read it DoctoDoctorWho
<DerpyMuffins> Blueblood isn't really a jerk
<DoctoDoctorWho> DerpyMuffins: :)
<Saturn> 08,01afternoon all
<cachi01> hi Saturn :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ohai saturn
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Saturn
*Saturn 08,01is watching Fiddler on the Roof
<male_writer> DerpyMuffins thank you for telling me about fimfiction, I never knew there was sight for it to be honest.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Afternoon Saturn :)
<JunkerKun> Saturn: Hey!
<DoctoDoctorWho> DerpyMuffins: Actually I've posted a new one. I think it's really good.
<Saturn> 08,01fimfiction is great
<BarbetosMyBananas> I know right!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: Do you have an account?
<DerpyMuffins> Fimfiction is fixed
<male_writer> Well, I am going to add it to my favorites just like i did with fanfiction
<BarbetosMyBananas> Saturn you remember that fan fic about twi getting Shining Armor and Chrysalis' baby?
<BarbetosMyBananas> That person needs to update their shit!
<DerpyMuffins> Foal in the basket?
<BarbetosMyBananas> YES
<Uboa-San> Hey there!
<BarbetosMyBananas> That one was good.
<cachi01> hi Uboa-San :)
<JunkerKun> Uboa-San: UBOAAAAAA!!!
<cachi01> iirc the last thing i read was a clopfic
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Uboa-San :)
<male_writer> Has anyone read some of the stories/fanfics on deviantart? There is one that I was reading, I think called "A Dragon's Tale" about Spike.
<BarbetosMyBananas> Anyways I think Saturn is the one who was talking about it here, so I ended up reading it.
<Uboa-San> mfw uboa :O
<cachi01> yfw u
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: Do you have a fimfiction account?
<BarbetosMyBananas> The only deviant art one I have read was a fic about the mane 6 ending up in alternate universe where NMM won.
<BarbetosMyBananas> That one was pretty good, but the idea is a little cliche at face value.
<Uboa-San> What's something that is most memorable? Mine is Majora's Mask's Stone Tower Temple,
<DerpyMuffins> I think After that fateful night did it best
<male_writer> Well, the "A Dragon's Tale" is real good, it is about Spike trying to leave Ponyville so he won't hurt Twilight or any of the other ponies, but guess what?
<male_writer> There is going to be a war for him
<Eli> Speaking of good writers who have to update their shit: DawnFade said he'll do a christmas special...
<male_writer> Twilight and the others are going to fight for him to stay in Ponyville
<DerpyMuffins> I did a christmas special
<cachi01> male_writer: meh
<DoctoDoctorWho> *sigh* Well, Ill be right back. brb
<DerpyMuffins> male_writer Check my stuff out!

<BarbetosMyBananas> It looks like its for photos
<JunkerKun> There was a really shitty story about this
<male_writer1215> Thank you MLP_Brovakiin
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Window To Equestria - 3D Ponies Everywhere
<cachi01> BarbetosMyBananas: wat
<JunkerKun> One day we saw this and the price was 270000 rubles (about 9000 bucks)
<JunkerKun> Those idiots just added two extra zeros!
<JunkerKun> Imagine amount of bricks we shit when we saw this
<Uboa-San> brb gonna do uboa event
<Lil_B> uboa?
<Uboa-San> Yes.
<Lil_B> ... damnit why am I so attracted to old Synth latly :(
<Lil_B> Uboa-San whats the Uboa event?
<JunkerKun> Uboa-San: Uboa event? Like having a little crazy girl and screaming UBOAAAAAA! ?
<Eli> Lil_B: you have steam right?
<Lil_B> Eli yes...
<Eli> Lil_B: would you join us in an epic adventure of castle crashers?
<Lil_B> Eli would have to buy and download it first
<Eli> eh
<Eli> it's like 200 mb
<Eli> downloads in seconds
<Lil_B> that would be abou 10 min for me, maybe 20 min... I haver 1MB per 3 Seconds on max
<Uboa-San> Lil_B: It's in the game Yume Nikki, In Poniko's Room in the Pink sea, If you turn off the lights. There will be a 1/64 Chance that the Uboa Event will Occur, Poniko will be replaced by Uboa and an Distorted AAAAAAAAAAAAA Is played, if you touch uboa you will be teleported to a Place, The background shows some creature, Bleeding. The only way to escape is to Pinch Madotsuki Awake or by using the Medamaude Effect.
<Uboa-San> Got the Uboa Event going!
<cachi01> UBOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Eli> Lil_B: well the other guy i'm playing with will be online in 20 min. so that's just fine :)
<JunkerKun> Uboa-San: Yeah. I thought so. The same good old Uboa event.
<Uboa-San> Oh, and you cant escape the room if you do the Uboa Effect. Using the light switch only causes another Flash of Light
<Lil_B> Eli I looked at it and... I don't really want to pay 4 € for a Game I may only play once or twice :(
<Eli> Lil_B: that's cool. so i'm gonna gift it to ya
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: 4 euro?
<cachi01> Lil_B: do it.its an awesome game
<Lil_B> JunkerKun 4 Euro and 9 Cents
<Eli> cachi01: yeah it's down on 4 atm. totall worth it
<Uboa-San> In the room where the creature is bleeding, Uboa's face is Distorted
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Only 2 and half here D=
<Lil_B> JunkerKun 2 and a half what?... in which country?
<Eli> Lil_B: so are yo gonna buy it, or do i have to send it to you?
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Russia. It costs 101 rubles here which roughly equals 2 and half euros
<Lil_B> Eli that's a tricky question, I don't wanna waste my money, but I don't wanna waste yours eather :/
<Eli> I don't mind either way. haven't done any "random acts of generosity" in a while.
<Lil_B> JunkerKun dat strange Oo
<Eli> Lil_B: so i'm just gonna send it to you
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Nothing strange. Every game is cheaper in Russia, since they adapted cost
<Lil_B> Eli wait just one second
<Eli> ookay
<Eli> it's cheaper for me too atm. strong swiss francs
<Lil_B> Eli I would like to trade it than against one of my spare games :P
<Lil_B> Eli I can give you Portal or any Half life 2 game
<Eli> Lil_B: portal 1?
<Lil_B> ... I even have a giftable copy of TF2
<Lil_B> Eli yes
<Eli> Lil_B: i was just about to buy that :)
<Lil_B> well, goinna trade it than :P

*Lil_B hugs Panda
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Panda! :)
<Panda> We need you on our home plannet, Lil_B. You are the only one who can save us.
<Lil_B> Panda what?!
<Panda> Kidding, wondering if you are busy is all.
<BarbetosMyBananas> I just had some one come in trying to buy a keylogger <<
<Eli> woooho. good trade
<BarbetosMyBananas> "Its just so I can keep track of everything on my computer."
<BarbetosMyBananas> Yeah right.
<GilDash> BarbetosMyBananas: Nah, he seems totally legit.
<Panda> BarbetosMyBananas, I keylogged my computer before. So I could figure out who was using it.
<Lil_B> Panda not really busy, for the next 20 mins
<BarbetosMyBananas> Panda Yeah. I have seen it used for that too. Not even sure where you could get a "legit" keyloging device or software
<MadSurge> Lil_B! Panda! :3
<Eli> Panda: and then we're gonna have an epic adventure of Castles and Crashes
<Panda> Lil_B, I see. ^^ What time is it there anyhow?
<Eli> Panda: it's 5pm
<Lil_B> Panda 17:13 in middle Europe
<Panda> BarbetosMyBananas, its also a good way to catch gf's in lies. >.>

<Lil_B> Eli derp
<Panda> GilDash, you don't drink coffee.
<Lil_B> Panda I don't know in whcvih >Timezone Reikim is :/
<GilDash> Panda: There's more to caffeine than just coffee.
<BarbetosMyBananas> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAFjgpuWREM
<Lil_B> like coke... or diet coke... or coke zero...
<GilDash> Caffeine's in chocolate, after all.
<Panda> Lil_B, he is an hour ahead of me iirc.

<DerpyMuffins> Whatsoever
<DerpyMuffins> Just a car and gun
<Agrold> yeah, I was a bit dissapointed about that too
<Agrold> but I really liked some other parts of it tho, like the car and his background story. Not gonna spoil anything for those who haven't watched it yet
<GilDash> I actually liked that about Skyfall. All the gadgets were getting boring.
<Agrold> but the only kind of gadget in this was... a tiny radio:P

<GilDash> CCharmanderK: Don't tell me... he's a guy, right?! :O
<MLP_Brovakiin> both his names begin with a 'J' :O
<CCharmanderK> In the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, each JoJo is called as such because their names can be shortened to "JoJo".
<[Alpha]> grr if no morepeople come into work i'm going to start watching Adventure Time
<CCharmanderK> Like Jonathan Joestar, Jotaro Kujo, and Giorno Giovanna.

<DaringDerpy> and the one with the books
<jcelios> DaringDerpy: Ghosties
<DaringDerpy> oh ^^
<Panda> Kirzstrife.
<Panda> Ghosties is the one with the bandages.
<CCharmanderK> And the green-maned one is Sumica's OC.
<DaringDerpy> kirzstrife...he's studying?
<CCharmanderK> Which is weird.
<CCharmanderK> Since Sumica is a dude.
<DaringDerpy> sumica's is famous
<Panda> Is Sumica really a dood?
<jcelios> CCharmanderK: is he... really though? Can you prove it?
<GilDash> CCharmanderK: Never heard of R63?

<CCharmanderK> Sorry, Sumi. We were discussing your pony OC.
<killerpony7733> Sumica Indeed. However is it correct what i said? that your R63 OC wears a goth skirt and top?
<jcelios> pretty sure its not a maid outfit
<Sumica> 00,10not goth no.
<DaringDerpy> ohai Sumica
<GilDash> No, Nittany is the one who wears a maid outfit.
<Sumica> 00,10not maid either. just generic realy
<Panda> It's not a maid outfit. Who would wear a maid outfit at the beach.
<CCharmanderK> Specifically, we were discussing why your OC is female.
<killerpony7733> Aaaah that clears it up.
<GilDash> Panda: Nittany.
<DaringDerpy> oh, right, that was nittany
<Sumica> 00,10and the one with books and trident is Val

<CCharmanderK> EVURYNYAN

<killerpony7733> Panda Wut? :D
<Sumica> 00,10but my best frined lives there DaringDerpy
*DaringDerpy back to darker than black
<Panda> Kipkat07_Scarf, I mean.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Panda: de'whaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Panda> Kipkat07_Scarf, horrible experience when I was 5. Nothing to talk about.
<CCharmanderK> AH WEESH AI WUH A BARHD.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Sumica: but I live in america
<GilDash> I knew someone at primary school who had a phobia of horses and ponies. We had to go on a field trip that involved walking through a field of them. He wasn't happy. XD
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Panda: ah. I see.
<Sumica> 00,10I had a bad encounter with a horse as a kid, I still like them
<DaringDerpy> Sumica: ok, we only burn down the swedish king's house
<caligulasAquarium> WHUT DIID U SEEEEED

<Kipkat07_Scarf> Sumica: sounds... wait, huh?
<caligulasAquarium> :D
<Sumica> 00,10no it failed but it did fream me right the hell out at the time
<[Alpha]> I don't like cold hands :I
<Kipkat07_Scarf> my mom thinks I dont know how to use the touchpad on my computer because I prefer using my wireless mouse and cant understand why I prefer using a mouse. >_<
<Kipkat07_Scarf> MUM, Y U NO UNDERSTAND LAPTOPS
<pony_160> hi there
<[Alpha]> It's just preference and feel maybe
<Panda> Kipkat07_Scarf, this is because parents have an intellegence so high that they cannot comprehend simplicity.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ohai
<DaringDerpy> she prefers to work with the touchpad?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Panda: ex-fucking-actly except for the high part. I constantly teach her stuff about politics, history, computers, science, logic, etc.
*BladedWings glomps AttackWithHugs "Ohai" ^_^
<Kipkat07_Scarf> DaringDerpy: I believe so..
<Panda> Kipkat07_Scarf, t'was sarcasm.
<AttackWithHugs> I've been spotted! :O
*Kipkat07_Scarf failed.
<BladedWings> AttackWithHugs: that you have ^_^
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I must go to Skyrim to avenge this failure
<DaringDerpy> A horse bit me into the finger when I was a kid. Tried to feed it with a carrot. These beasts have huge teeth. But it made no damage, didn't break the skin. I didn't even scream at it, but it looked to guilty and unhappy. :(
<Sumica> 00,10My fave is the parent asking you to come look at something on laptop.
<[Alpha]> I prefer having something in my hands to draw with. My stylus designed for ipad works on computer screen as well as laptop touchpads.
<DaringDerpy> -to +so
<Sumica> 00,10cause you know they could not have just broughtit to you
<[Alpha]> Sumica: I love that
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Sumica: exactly why I dont let my mom use mine.
<Panda> Sumica, I am glad I am like Scootaloo; no parents.
<Panda> For that very reason.
<Panda> Well, other reasons as well.
*Kipkat07_Scarf gets into his C-130 and flies away to Skyrim
<Kipkat07_Scarf> byeeeeeeee
<Sumica> 00,10I like my parents but yeah I am glad dad is a technophobe.
<Sumica> 00,10cause mom hears things and gets all freaked out
<[Alpha]> My parents are getting worse. they call me from upstairs from their cell phone to the downstairs house phone to have me do stuff for them or ask me something.
<Saturn> 08,01scootaloo has parents
<Saturn> 08,01AJ doesn't
<Panda> Saturn, you know what I mean xD
<DaringDerpy> scootaloo sleeps in the treehouse
<Saturn> 08,01Kipkat07_Scarf: pfft, C-130? what you need is an E-3
<Sumica> 00,10such as the thing a few months back where the FBi was turning off the DNS they had set up to counter act the effects of a long dead virus
<NekoC> HELLO!
<Sumica> 00,10so mom calls me up freaking out that she wound have internet any more cause the FBI is turning it off

<DaringDerpy> hm...

<DaringDerpy> I always wished I have none
<Saturn> 08,01DaringDerpy: that first pic of scoots sleeping in the clubhouse reminded me of this (really fucking sad) fanfic: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/10/story-final-dream-of-filly.html
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Saturn: didnt scoot read that on stream one day?
<Saturn> 08,01did he?
<Saturn> 08,01i have no idea
<[Alpha]> I'll have to remmeber the name. Can't read these at work.
<[Alpha]> remember
<DaringDerpy> thanks, saturn. I'll read it
<DaringDerpy> and then the chat froze again
<[Alpha]> So....
<DaringDerpy> this blue sidebar button thing freezes all the time. and the whole applet with it
<jcelios> So sew buttons and be a tailor!
<[Alpha]> applet?
<DaringDerpy> the webchat
<jcelios> thus is lightIRC
<DaringDerpy> hm...
<Sumica> 00,10you know, I rather like this guys car. http://screensnapr.com/v/ZqTWp8.jpg
<Panda> Needs more Rarity.
<[Alpha]> freaking sweet
<Panda> In fact, I dont see Rarity there at all.
<Panda> Blasphemy.
<GilDash> Lack of Spitfire. Disappoint.
<jcelios> Theres always the other side :)
<Panda> Spitfire is worst pony >.>
<DaringDerpy> twilight as sniper?
<GilDash> I object stringly to that.
<Panda> Strongly* you mean?
<Panda> If you object "stringly," its weak and will blow away in the wind.
<Ryunosuke> Strawberry Cheesecake is possibly the best thing ever invented :)
<GilDash> Disregard Panda; aqcuire Spitfire.
<[Alpha]> http://derpy.me/4eBH-

<Ryunosuke> uhhhhhh
<Panda> GilDash, your spelling is off today hun.
<Ryunosuke> sumica
<GilDash> Panda: I blame Sweetie Bell. She's being a useless dictionary today.
<Ryunosuke> there is a better one :)
<DaringDerpy> can't read this fanfic without dictionary. too much advanced vocabulary
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: i think i've seen that in person
<Saturn> 08,01it was at GalaCon

<GilDash> Where the hell does that tie disappear to? O_o
<Panda> GilDash, dont think too hard. It's a pony after all.
<GilDash> Overthinking is my forte though.
<Panda> That it is.

<[Alpha]> I have a new favorite show (besides My litle Pony) Dan Vs.
<CCharmanderK> The new seasons from season six onward have been awful.
<CCharmanderK> Season five had its moments.
<BroPony|PYRO> i've only seen 3 minutes of Dan Vs. is it good?
<Catalan_Brony> have there been more than 5?
<Catalan_Brony> lawl
<Snow> you know what has to get better?
<CCharmanderK> But you just can't beat SpongeBob seasons 1-4.
<Snow> Dutch voice acting.
<[Alpha]> Yes I find it freaking Hilarious
<CCharmanderK> There have been nine seasons of SpongeBob so far.
<Snow> IT IS TERRIBLE
<CCharmanderK> Seasons six-nine of SpongeBob have been awful, though.
<xles> Can't be as bad as current swedish voice acting. =(
<Snow> you do not want to hear ANY good show in dutch voice overs
<Snow> or Movie
<CCharmanderK> The last "awesome" SpongeBob episode was the one where Krabs retired and the Krusty Krab was reformatted into the Krabby O'Mondays.
<Snow> that is just terrible
<CCharmanderK> Hey, the SpongeBob movie fucking owned.

<CCharmanderK> Hey, who here has a favorite episode of SpongeBob?

<mitamaking> CCharmanderK: Off the top of my head, the one that spoofs Game of Death
<Bronysith> uh

<Catalan_Brony> that was the latin spanish opening.

<CCharmanderK> Brace for impact.
<CCharmanderK> ATLANTIS SQUAREPANTIS.
<BroPony|PYRO> mitamaking: that was a really good one
<CCharmanderK> That was one hour of sheer pain.
<BroPony|PYRO> CCharmanderK: it wasnt...bad
<mitamaking> I don't recall Atlantis being that bad
<mitamaking> Oh I know the best..... The Krusty Krab training video
<BroPony|PYRO> ^
<BroPony|PYRO> YES
<CCharmanderK> BroPony|PYRO: Unfunny jokes, horrible songs, bad CG, shit pacing...
<BroPony|PYRO> CCharmanderK: ok it was that bad :P

<BroPony|PYRO> every t.v show out there gets worse over the years
<CCharmanderK> mitamaking: And THAT is why it's so bad. There is literally nothing memorable about it. It's an overall painful bore.
<BroPony|PYRO> the simpsons, big bang theory, family guy, american dad ect
<[Alpha]> What about House?
<mitamaking> BroPony|PYRO: My Little Pony?
<PonyIshBest> what are we talking about?
<BroPony|PYRO> [Alpha]: A moment of silence
<BroPony|PYRO> mitamaking: No, that will last a long time

<Lyra_Heartstrings> ive seen all these pictures about 10 ten times now
<Ryunosuke> its the offline online
<Afflict> why does my phone vibrate for no reason?
<Ryunosuke> umm offline slideshow :p
<Alchemist> the two shooting stars as AJ's parents was a really nice touch in the last ep imo
<Ryunosuke> that brings up a question though
<Ryunosuke> applebloom? :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> And then when she see's me she'll have never seen me before and if she's never seen me before that means she'll assume I dont have any friends and if I dont have any friends that means I'm sooo lonely and that'll make her sad so she'll go and throw a secret surprise party just for me and introduce me to everypony in ponyville!
<DoctoDoctorWho> And then I'll have lots and lots of friends!
<Alchemist> Ryunosuke: what about her?
<Lyra_Heartstrings> i wonder if that pony eating bacon pic represents BaconMane
<Ryunosuke> well all of it
<FashizzleInYoNizzle> Because the phone wants to go in no mans land
<DoctoDoctorWho> That or she call's the royal gaurd, either or.
<Ryunosuke> Lyra_Heartstrings: it is
<FashizzleInYoNizzle> MLP in CrYENGINE 3: http://www.crydev.net/viewtopic.php?f=311&p=1094147#p1094147
<DoctoDoctorWho> That eye thing chasing SB64, does that remind anypony of Hermaus Mora?
<Lyra_Heartstrings> i think that the pony drawing a dragon represents Wrek
<Ryunosuke> reminds me of a pokemon :)
<Ryunosuke> it is :)

<FashizzleInYoNizzle> I wished someone happy birthday right here: http://www.crydev.net/viewtopic.php?f=126&t=103600
<Afflict> So is it an actual game or just a movie?

<[Alpha]> I forgot the song already
<Bronysith> taoumi: yea, but they fucking half assed it
<Amu-chan> XD
<taoumi> lol yeah they did
<Bronysith> and put their heart and souls into one time characters songs
<Stormy> even ask dari
<Bronysith> like flim flam or cadance
<Bronysith> god i hate the studio
<Saturn> 08,01is what me?
<FashizzleInYoNizzle> lol
<String_Shredder> A picture.
<String_Shredder> http://i.imgur.com/CsVAL.jpg

<Saturn> 08,01ah, no, that's otakon
<Lil_B> hello String_Shredder and SafariMonkey
<Saturn> 08,01also, who made that?
<Saturn> 08,01because that is very mean
<String_Shredder> I don't know. One of the regulars.
<SafariMonkey> Hey Lil_B
<SafariMonkey> :P
<SafariMonkey> Tab fail?
<Bronysith> taoumi: yea, again, put their heart and soul into songs that are meant for shite characters, yet make sure the songs for already established ones suck
*Lil_B hugs SafariMonkey
*SafariMonkey hugs Lil_B back :3
<Saturn> 08,01racist barn was an uncalled for song
<[Alpha]> Maybe they plan on making more with Apple Jack?
<Saturn> 08,01i don't know why it was in there
<Saturn> 08,01it didn't add anything to the episode
<Saturn> 08,01i blame hasbro's meddling
<Bronysith> Saturn: so applejack fans would shut up about her not having a song
<String_Shredder> Also, this: http://i.imgur.com/ioosZ.png
<Afflict> My phone wants to go to no mans land again
<Eli> right Sarurn? it was so racist
<DerpyMuffins> The first and last of Applejack songs
<Lil_B> finally got around getting Metropolis in HD >.< , also just bought the Humble Bundle 7, I wanna play Closure, I heard that game makes you feel very uncomfortable
<Saturn> 08,01it sounded like a song that was just there to fill up a soundtrack CD
<Saturn> 08,01to appeal to younger viewers
<Bronysith> Saturn: again, the studio hates applejack
<Lil_B> I hope Hasbro releases the Episode earlier again so I may download it before it airs, I wanna have the episode when the meetup starts
<FashizzleInYoNizzle> hahahaahaahahhahaaahahahahaahha
<DerpyMuffins> This show is meant to appeal to young viewers Saturn
<FashizzleInYoNizzle> the phone wants to go to Lil' Joey'
<Eli> does anyone here play magic the gathering?
<Bronysith> Saturn: they hate her and everything that has to do with her
<Alchemist> who hates what?
<[Alpha]> I'm still listening to the cuti mark crudaers song :P
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, the song kinda came out of nowhere and stole some episode time
<Afflict> wut
<Stormy> wut
<Stormy> haha
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: not sure if you're joking or if you actually believe that
<Afflict> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535
<DerpyMuffins> It was an excuse to finally give her a song, that's it
<Stormy> it's funny
<Bronysith> Saturn: of course they hate her
<Stormy> because I was going to say "wat"
<Stormy> but for some reason I said "wut" instead
<Eli> Bronysith: they aren't all like you
<Afflict> lol
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: okay, that just doesn't make sense from just about every perspective i can think of
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Eli> Bronysith: hating everything, i mean
<Bronysith> Eli: i dont hate everything
<Lil_B> but honestly, a song appearing out of nowhere to steal episode time... I felt like this with both songs in the Premiere too... well, one reason I didn't like the S3 Primere anywhere :/
<FashizzleInYoNizzle> wut
<Saturn> 08,01i know one thing Bronysith loves
<scout19_tf2> :O
<[Alpha]> http://cheezburger.com/6920229888 speaking of AppleJack
<Eli> Bronysith: sure sounds like it though... everytime i'm on at the same time as you are, you're just hating on something else. why not apreciate the good things?
<Lil_B> he likes to take people to bed
<XAX> Saturn: That program you mentioned about a month ago to play Doom with multiplayer, chocolate doom, can be used to play doom2 on win8 .-.
<Lil_B> like Tommy Wiseau likes to "let's go home"
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: you do realize that there was another season 3 letter right?
<[Alpha]> I didn't make this
<Saturn> 08,01XAX: awesome
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: i know, but whoever did was so wrong
<Saturn> 08,01seaosn 3 letter?
<Saturn> 08,01oh right
<Saturn> 08,01friendship letter
<[Alpha]> Happens a lot on that website
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: cause that website sucks
<Phase4> 00,02i don't know why people bother buying cooking oils
<Phase4> 00,02just buy a bunch of bacon and cook things in the fat
<wipergone2> Phase4: hi
<Alchemist> Applejack's letter is just a bunch of curly lines. Illiterate peasant!
<Phase4> 00,02it makes for REALLLY delecious bacon
<Eli> Phase4: ... that is genius
<DerpyMuffins> That is very unhealthy Phase4
<[Alpha]> I get a luagh every now and then but mostly devianart gives me better laughs
<[Alpha]> laugh
<Phase4> 00,02DerpyMuffins, why?
<Saturn> 08,01in my headcanon, celestia gets a lettergasm every time she receives one from twilight and her friends
<DerpyMuffins> To cook everything in bacon fat?
<Lil_B> what I found funny about Win8 is, that the VLC Player Team made a Kickstarter to raise money for the development of the Win8 Version of the VLC Player, while
<Bronysith> Saturn: sounds about right
<Phase4> 00,02not everything, just things you'd use olive oil for otherwise
<Eli> Saturn: I don't even wanna imagine your headcanon
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, they made a kickstarter?
<Lil_B> while Microsoft didn't include the Media Player in the basic Version of Win8 because "people can just use the VLC Player instead"
<Lil_B> Phase4 yes, just a sec
<Alchemist> Phase4: like rescuing squirrels that got stuck in drain pipes?
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<[Alpha]> http://cheezburger.com/6912533504
*Bronysith glomps Phase4 into Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: bacon fat is worse for you than olive oil
<Phase4> 00,02they DIDNT in include a media player
<Eli> Phase4: though, olive oil is plant oil, not animal fat. it's healthier
<[Alpha]> I like this one
<Saturn> 08,01it contains more saturated fats
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, but is so delecious
<Saturn> 08,01true
<Saturn> 08,01very true
<Saturn> 08,01hey Phase4, what do you look like?
<Saturn> 08,01i just realised i have no idea
<Phase4> 00,02plus it's cheeper than oil
<DerpyMuffins> He is an Albino
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, overweight with too much beard
<SuperBrony64> 11,02uggh...I'm so full...

<Lil_B> Phase4 yeah, I just checked it, some Win8 Version don't come with the Media Player installed... the one thing the generall Dum,b User who doesn't know much about PCs liked about Windows is, that you could just put in a CD or DVD, and it would play what's on it :/

<Lil_B> Phase4 no wait, I read it wrong, some versions don't include Medfia Player by default, but the ability to play DVD natifly got removed , because it was too expensive to buy the licenses for the decoders, same for Streaming services... however, you can buy the decoders with the "Pro Pack" ... or just get VLC Player :/

<Lil_B> Eli looks like the Black Mesa Sign
<Lil_B> Ok, the Movie Titles were managable, but these ones are too extreme for me
<Eli> Lil_B: tehy are nerdy. at least i know the Ark of the Covenant...
<Lil_B> Bundeslade is way better of a word xD
<Lil_B> "is a way better word" - fixd
<Eli> Lil_B: i prefer to have a general knowledge of a lot of things than knowing everything about a single subject
<Lil_B> I mix both
<Eli> goooood it's not jakie chan

<ThunderBreeze> Hi
<Lil_B> Eli ikr xD
<Lil_B> hi ThunderBreeze

<Eli> Lil_B: that harry potter music in the back
<Lil_B> Eli and Darth Vader Theme...
<Eli> Lil_B: it is sooo german... srly? Bohlen and Bernd?

<Eli> Lil_B: i know right? I sometimes hit KIKA on at 1 am and watch it for hours
<Lil_B> Eli yeah, used to do that too : ) I hope they will finally show his New-Years speech again
<Eli> that would be epic. i'll watch out for it
<Lil_B> Eli if not, youtube
<Eli> yep
<Eli> my best friend is over at my plaace for silvester, and he loves him too :)
<Eli> ein Ess-cape... epic
<Lil_B> Eli "Generally we can say, that the coming year will not be better than the previous one, it can only get worse and it will, therefore, I highly reccomend you get yourself a shovel, dig a hole, and sit in it... a very deep hole" I mean... KIDS TV for Kids under 12 years! xD
<Eli> Lil_B: he always brings epic stuff like that
<Saturn> 08,01this is fun
*Bronysith puts Saturn in a blanket
<Lil_B> mmm... ok, need to PM that...
*Saturn 08,01snugs the blanket
<Eli> Lil_B: srly, he should get translated and brought on the hub
<Lil_B> Eli nahh, way to "dark", "unfunny" and "depressing" for american audiences,
<Lil_B> But perfect for 18-30 year old people xD... cxue it just after MLP
<Eli> Lil_B: probably... but we love our little depressed bi-polar Bernd
<Lil_B> yeah :)
<Lil_B> I actually got a Present for someone in the UK, a copy of "Dinner for one" I heard it never ever aired in the UK
<Eli> Lil_B: really? can't imagine that. we watch it every year
<Lil_B> Eli well, british comedy made in germany... seriously, all the people you here laughing in that Scetch are german
<jcelios> Saturn: Do you have anymore bug porn? :$
<Eli> i haven't sat with my family to watch it for years tho... don't even know if they have an accent anymore
<Cypresswolf> :) I'm glad the holidays provide a short work week - It's like I'm on vacation

<Lil_B> Eli yeah... I think Mime would be the right word
<Eli> Lil_B: welp. english is hard sometimes.
<Eli> Lil_B: and i'm not being sarcastic here
<Saturn> 08,01english is a bitch of a language
<Saturn> 08,01Dutch is quite easy
<Saturn> 08,01German is moderately hard
<Saturn> 08,01i love German poetry
<Lil_B> Eli yeah :/
<Eli> Saturn: actually I find english quite easy compared to any other language i know more or less
<Punkie_Pue> Saturn, what is your native language?
<Saturn> 08,01Punkie_Pue: english
<Saturn> 08,01i'm from Scotland
<Lil_B> I heard Russion is rather hard, and the most hard language to learn would be icelandic
<Lil_B> My english teacher is from scottland
<Punkie_Pue> Do you know any other languages?
<Saturn> 08,01German and a bit of Dutch
<Saturn> 08,01but i'm not as fluent in German as i used to be
<Saturn> 08,01and even then, i wasn't all that fluent in it
<Saturn> 08,01but i could get by
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: That sounds like a nice brew - let me know how it tastes, will you? :)
<Punkie_Pue> The reason I ask is I have entertained the idea of learning german.
<Eli> Saturn: well, if you want to practice: i'm here :)
<Saturn> 08,01Punkie_Pue: doo eeet!
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: i might try and skype you and Lil_B
<Eli> Punkie_Pue: it's not really worth it, in my opinion. but go on
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: I heard of a new local whiskey brewed here in Houston - Rebecca Creek
<Eli> Saturn: sure
<Bronysith> Saturn: lets do a 4 way call
<Punkie_Pue> I was thinking the same, not being worth it.
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: you know german?
<Eli> Bronysith: do you speak german?
<Bronysith> Saturn: oh nvm then >.>
<Cypresswolf> Haven't tried it yet, I'll get me some this weekend
<Saturn> 08,01heh
<Lil_B> Punkie_Pue german is ok, and actually more doable if you know english
<Punkie_Pue> thats good to know.
<Punkie_Pue> living in the us, i tink spanish wold be more useful.
<Punkie_Pue> think
<Punkie_Pue> would
<Eli> Saturn: add me on skype if you want. can't promise i'm often online, but the name would be "eli.brony" i guess

<Lil_B> Saturn when you travel North from Thüringen than you probably won't get that near to me :(
<Saturn> 08,01Socks: who is that?
<CCharmanderK> Yeah, who is that?
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: well, i'm willing to travel anywhere

<Saturn> 08,01Socks: i have no idea what that is
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Socks :)
<Socks> Great indie game, won some awards.
<kidzrul732> hey bronies I'm watching The Avengers on dvd with my brother, father and my other bros mordo and rigs! WAZZZUP?!
<Socks> Ohai MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Bogy> so.. when is the next stream? or other ways... will there be a other stream until friday night and when?^^
<Rex_Mundi> *puts Socks on Saturn*
<CCharmanderK> kidzrul732 Who is this and why is he acting five?
<Socks> I suppose Steven Hawking also lives in my home town so there are more exiting people to meet I suppose :P
<kidzrul732> The avengers is a movie
<Socks> But I thought it was cool
<JE_Smith71> Bogy: It's random when there are streams outside the scheduled ones
<Bogy> okay :)
<CCharmanderK> kidzrul732 I know that, dingus. I wanna know why you're acting like a five-year-old.
<kidzrul732> I'm not I'm just hanging out
<Lil_B> Saturn well, I'm checking atm how far it would be
<Cypresswolf> My beer list is getting very long :D so many brews to try, so little time :)
<CCharmanderK> You came in here with a ton of bad grammar and a random blurb of something that had no relation to what we were talking about.
<Saturn> 08,01Socks: ARE YOU KIDDING?
<Lil_B> ... I sense a Browser-derp coming up again...
<Saturn> 08,01i'd LOVE to meet stephen hasking!
*Bronysith puts on Socks
<Saturn> 08,01he's just the most amazing man!
<CCharmanderK> And you topped it off with WAZZUP.
<Saturn> 08,01*hawking
<Eli> SafariMonkey: he really is
<Socks> Saturn: Nope I live in cambridge, saw him in an elevator my friend used to play with his kids as a child :P
<SafariMonkey> :P
<Saturn> 08,01he's... i don't even know, i think i'd explode if i met him
<Saturn> 08,01he's one of my all-time heroes
<CCharmanderK> That's the kind of thing I associate with 12-year-old AOL users.
<Cypresswolf> Once I've had enough of Texas's micro brews, I'll tour the other 49 states, and the THE WORLD!
<kidzrul732> The avengers KICKS ASS!
<SafariMonkey> Tab fail, Eli? :P
<CCharmanderK> No offense if you are.
<Lil_B> I 'd like to send a Mail to Steven hawking about some unanswered qquestion that didn't get answered, from his book
<Socks> Come to Cambridge, I think he still lives here.
<Socks> Probably :/
<Saturn> 08,01he does; i think he still lectures at cambridge
<CCharmanderK> I agree that The Avengers is a fantastic film. But you're going about talking about it the wrong way.
<Eli> SafariMonkey: yeperl
<Cypresswolf> :3 I'm such an alchy :D
<Socks> Probably, I don't check :P
<Saturn> 08,01Cypresswolf: waht'd you drink?
<Eli> SafariMonkey: i tabfail at least once a day or i don't feel good
<Socks> All the best people are from Cambridge
<Saturn> 08,01Cypresswolf: also, i can guarantee i'm worse
<kidzrul732> whatever, I'm just gonna keep watching the movie
<Saturn> 08,01or, at least, i was at one point
<CCharmanderK> I love that we have at least three different conversations happening at the exact same time. :P
<Socks> Steven Fry, Hugh Laurie, The goodies and half of the pythons from around here.
<CCharmanderK> ^ See?
<Saturn> 08,01well... prince william went to my uni.
<Saturn> 08,01harumph.
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: It's probably more natural for him to meet digitally, given his condition and method of communication. But that would be awesome, yeah. Too bad his M-theory doesn't stand up to the test.
<Socks> XD
<Cypresswolf> Lately - Johnny Walker, Budweiser, Smirnoff, Margarita, Gentleman Jack, and ... what did I have at the Texans game...Crown Royal and something 7
<Socks> Prince William is duke of my town :P
<Socks> My Cousin's Cousin had dinner with him :P
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: aye, also a shame about black holes
<CCharmanderK> Teri Hatcher is my second cousin and I met the mailman from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood once. :/
<Lil_B> my Idea is, Light maybe is the fastest thing in the Universe, but it's speed should not be statest as the speed Limit of the Universe, according to e=mc² it would ben that , if there would be something that has less mass than a quantum of light, it woul be faster than Light
<Eli> Saturn: and Albert Einstein went to my school. but it's not really something to brag about
<Cypresswolf> All that since sunday
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: aye; einstein did really poorly at school
<GabeMoist> light has no mass
<Eli> Saturn: he didn't
<Socks> I don't really know anybody, I happen to live in a place where awesome people live.
<Eli> Saturn: that's butll
<Saturn> 08,01GabeMoist: but it does have momentum
<Eli> bull*
<Socks> Eli: He wasn't that interested though
<Cypresswolf> the only standout on that list is the Johnny Walker
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: In case you haven't looked into it, The Grand Design is a huge tautology.
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: one of his teachers called him a "lazy dog" in his report card
<Eli> Saturn: german school counting system is teh revers one of the swiss system. when his marks lookd bad for a german, in switzerland they look like the best stuff
<Eli> Saturn: it makes no sense but it's true
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: i've not, actually
<Eli> note: i hate our school system
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: ah, okay
<Cypresswolf> There's still some Cider brews in the liqour store I've been wanting to try - and next moth - Saki :)
<Saturn> 08,01Einstein was dyslexic
<Saturn> 08,01so is Anthony Hopkins
<Eli> Saturn: there's many degrees of dyslexia. i have it to
<Eli> too*
<Lil_B> GabeMoist it has, otherwise the equalation e=mc² would't work because you would have to devide through zero when you reform it to c=root(E/m)
<Socks> A lot of people are dyslexic
<Eli> Saturn: i still love reading more than most people
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: i have very slight dyslexia, but mostly i have ADHD and PDA
<Eli> Saturn: same same
<Socks> Anyone have Dispraxia?
<Socks> Coz I do :(
<Socks> Sad tings
<Dismo> Considering I almost chopped half my finger off, and I have half a month work, I guess I finally have time from Bronystate. :"3
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: well, technically it doesn't have mass, but it has energy, is affected by gravity, and has momentum
<Cypresswolf> There's got to be a brew of the week for each year - must look that up - If I don't find it, Patent Pending!
<Saturn> 08,01Socks: my brother has really bad dyspraxia
<Saturn> 08,01he literally writes like a 4 year old
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: Well it is. BAsically it boils down to saying that because the gravity exists, it created a universe to affect, which itself caused the existence of gravity. Not quite that simple, but it's that kind of thing.
<Bogy> it's 2:17 a.m. and im not tired but bored... do a stream! xD
<Dismo> AW, sb64
<Socks> Saturn: My sister is 5 and her handwriting is better than mine :/
<Eli> Saturn: actually writing about our disorders on here is kinda sad... can we move on?
<Saturn> 08,01Socks: i'd give you a dyspraxic high five, buyt we'd both miss and fall off our chairs
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight everyone! :)
<Socks> XD
<Socks> Bye MLP_Brovakiin
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: A quote from the book: "Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist."
<Socks> Eli: What would you rather talk about? Ponies?
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: That's its premise
<Eli> Socks: eh why not. ponies are better than my sad disfunctional life
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: i'm not sure how seriously to take that
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: Let me know if you ever decide to visit the states, specifically Texas - I know quite a few place with great local brews :)
<Socks> Eli: So which pony is best pony?
<Eli> Socks: Luna of course
<Socks> :O
<Eli> Socks: stupid question
<Saturn> 08,01Dismo: is your finger okay?
*Socks huggles fluttershy
<Eli> Socks: oh you would get along well with a friend of mine
*Saturn 08,01would probably kill himself if he lost any fingers
<Socks> All my love for Fluttershy :P
<Eli> flutters fanatics...
<Saturn> 08,01life without being able to play the cello anymore wouldn't be worth living.
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: It's basically a combination of that and the anthropic principle. Both of them I find to be ridiculous and ultimately tautological.
<Socks> She is just so cute!
<Eli> Saturn: i can't properly move half of my left hand
<Socks> And probably the most likely to kill somepony ¬_¬
<Socks> But mainly cute :)
<Mr_Kopple> evening all
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: what'd you do to it?
<Eli> Saturn: blocked nerves or something
<Lil_B> hello Mr_Kopple
<JE_Smith71> There is no best pony it's all just personal preference
<Eli> Saturn: woke up with it
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: One more thing! You can't visit Texas and leave without trying REAL BBQ - I'll tell you a local secret if/when the time comes :)
<Saturn> 08,01wow, how odd
<Socks> brb
<Saturn> 08,01Cypresswolf: sure!
<Lil_B> Food is, biside the language, the most iconic thing a Country has to offer :)
<Shizuka> there is a best pony
<Shizuka> her name is vivi
<Eli> Saturn: yeah it doesn't really help when i'm gaming or writing. it's also pretty much the reason i never capitalize anything
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka! i had another dream about you!
<Saturn> 08,01and it wasn't dirty!
<Eli> Shizuka: that's not how you spell Luna
<Saturn> 08,01you were in a forest and kept screaming for something and digging, then we were in a mine and you were trying to open a door
<jcelios> sounds like minecraft
<Lil_B> If I had to show a guest from anopther country our local food... I don't know... Handkäs mit Musik or a Schnitzel
<Saturn> 08,01the door led to this blue room that was somehow also my bedroom, and there was this blue glowing piece of cobalt
<Shizuka> don't trust doors
<Saturn> 08,01it was the most beautiful colour i'd ever seen
<Eli> Lil_B: give him Würste
<GilDash> Sounds like a dirty dream. Mines are always filthy, right?
<Eli> Lil_B: Currywurst
<Lil_B> Eli xD Presskopp
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: Another interpretation is that the laws of nature exist outside of the universe and created the universe. But that doesn't really kelp either, as you're just pushing causality back a step.
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: hells yeah currywurst!
<Eli> Lil_B: uhhh Kartoffelsalat! best german dish ever
<Lil_B> Eli Currywurst :P naahhh wi sinn hier nett im Ruhrpot!
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: aye, exactly
<SafariMonkey> Anyway
<SafariMonkey> </rant>
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: we get that here too; but the german version is better
<Eli> Lil_B: Bierbraten? also pretty good
<SafariMonkey> Ah. Kelp. :P
<Saturn> 08,01bierbraten, yum
<Saturn> 08,01knackwurst
<Lil_B> but it also depends where y<ou get it, Kartoffelsalat changes from North to South
<Burning|Grey|> Saturn; your dream sounds a bit like something from the Cuil Theory xD
<Saturn> 08,01Burning|Grey|: what's that?
<Burning|Grey|> Saturn; i think its about the posibility of the osibility
<Burning|Grey|> posibility
*Socks is back in the clurb so put yo hands urp
<Burning|Grey|> or something
<Lil_B> and then Flash died, at least it was just a few secs...
<Burning|Grey|> Saturn; its a video
<Saturn> 08,01i love it when #bronystate is talking about interesting things like tonight
<Kandarihu> Hey guys, I finally made it back home.
<Saturn> 08,01it gives me faith that our userbase hasn't just descended into a bunch of bronysiths
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<Eli> Saturn: german dishes?
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: i love rottkohl and leberkãse on bread
<Burning|Grey|> Saturn; xD fair enough
<JE_Smith71> Streams up
<Eli> Saturn: no wait i hate Currywurst. And Leberkäse. and everything
<Socks> Who's streaming?
<Eli> Saturn: >_><_<

<Socks> Dat truck is mlg
<Saturn> 08,01it's made with chocolate, oats, and coffee
<adasdad> aah, sweden.
<adasdad> that explains it.
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: I just read your comment on Rotkohl and even though I'd never heard of it, immediately knew what it was. O.o
<Saturn> 08,01and apparently, wrek makes really good negroballs
<Saturn> 08,01so i really want to taste his balls.
<Lil_B> aniderp|bestcakeever what's with it? I preordered it today :)

<aniderp|bestcakeever> well im gonna order it sometime this week
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: ERMERGERD YOU'RE PSYCHIC
<jcelios> all of the gangs are assholes in this game
<Lil_B> aniderp|bestcakeever yes, the Limited version with leather cover and Golden edge-pages
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: just know lots of languages
<adasdad> well, they are gangs
<jcelios> "freedom fighters"
<shizumobile> A beeg price
<shizumobile> With beeg amerikan teevees
<Barbetos> Don't trust him!!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> where you order it?
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: In scandinavia, negro (e.g. negara in Faroese) is generally not at all offensive
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: aye
<jcelios> besides gangs can be reasonbile people ^.^
<aniderp|bestcakeever> its llike 20 dollar
<kully6745> does serdadu mean waifu in indonesian
<Saturn> 08,01negro isn't all that offensive here iether
<SafariMonkey> Yeah
<jcelios> anti-matter matter interactions
<Saturn> 08,01is it offensive in the US?
<Bronysith> Saturn: apparently
<jcelios> Saturn: Technically no, in pratice probably
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: Dunno, UK here too
<Kandarihu> I would like to formally apologize for voting for Assassin's Creed II over this in the Community's Choice sale. If I waited a while and saw this game on the stream, I would've voted for Just Cause 2
<Barbetos> this is ula with panao tech support
<adasdad> NEWTON ROLLING IN GRAVE
<Bronysith> Saturn: apparently we owe black people for when we had them as slaves...
<Lil_B> ... Negrto would probably kinda offensive in some peoples twisted minds of our society :/
<adasdad> TAP HIS CORPSE FOR ENERGY
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: Actually, it's more correctly translated "nigger" usually, but tha's not offensive either
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: really? last i heard "nigger" was *very* offensive
<Barbetos> well.
<Barbetos> enemies out side of mission area
<Barbetos> thats cute
<NullRadix> might depend which side of the atlantic you're on
<adasdad> lol
<KrazyNoobs> hai guise
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: No, I mean it's not offensive there, certainly no more than negro is here
<Lil_B> We had a Cancellor who opened a speech in Afrika with the words "Ladys and Gentleman, dear Niggers" (in german) Appearently nobody took it as something offensiuve... except the Media of course ...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Lil_B: really? wow
<adasdad> wut
<adasdad> so buggy
<Bronysith> Saturn: it is offensive down in USA, yet the blacks call themselves that all the time, but as soon as a white guy mutters "nigger" oh dear...
<Lil_B> Sketch_Toku_Brony was inb the 80's I think
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah i see
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: I know it's offensive here, it's just it's not offensive there just like the f word is like "crap" in europe in terms of vulgarity
<kully6745> ustream is back on
<KrazyNoobs> I see we are discussing the magical n-word! :D
<jcelios> necromancy?
<KrazyNoobs> :)
<adasdad> jcelios! shame!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> NNNBananas?
<jcelios> :( sorry
<Socks> Nanotechnology?
<RoboGerbil> necromancy is definitely a magical n word
<Socks> Science is Magic
<Saturn> 08,01one of the only words that offends me, pretty much thte only thing that offends me, is the word "paki"
<Saturn> 08,01because i was teased using it as a kid
<Lil_B> Well, bye everyone, I need to got to bed :)
<RoboGerbil> whats paki?
<Socks> Night Lil_B
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> cya Lil_B
*Lil_B hugs Socks Sketch_Toku_Brony Eli and Saturn
<Socks> RoboGerbil: A derogitory term used against those of eastern origin, mainly used in the uk... I believe
<jcelios> I always thought it was just short for pakistanie
<Socks> Not for use in public, it's a word with a history
<Socks> Like Gollywog, It is a word that needs to vanish.
<KrazyNoobs> Who here has seen BoonDocks?
<kully6745> may Princess Luna guide you through the world of elated dreams Lil_B
<Socks> Not good :(
<adasdad> discord approves of this game's scoring system
<Socks> ^
<Snowden> what is ging on and what is this game?
<Socks> Stuff
<adasdad> snowden: discussing racial terms, just casue 2
<KrazyNoobs> I'm going to go check for the weekly spoiler. brb. :)
<Socks> An aweful lot of awesome stuff
<adasdad> cause*
<KrazyNoobs> And no, I'll keep quiet about it
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: I think that would have to depend on whether it is used with malintent. I mean, was it offensive to you when Prince Harry used it in what appeared to be a friendly, non-malicious way?
<adasdad> INFINITE AMMOS
*Socks doesn't even want to know the title of the next ep
<Snowden> racial terms :( bud Just Cause 2 :D
*Socks would appreciate the shushing
<Barbetos> Socks anyone could use the command to make it show up
<adasdad> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
<Barbetos> You should of not said anything
<Socks> D:
<Bronysith> Saturn: thats why i really dont like america, so much hypocracy...hippocracy? i dont know T~T
<Barbetos> Surprised no one has done it yet.
<Snowden> Barbetos: dont tempt them
<Socks> America just had to be different with it's spelling
<Barbetos> you might want to not stick around here at all if you don't even want to know the title.
<Socks> Meh, it doesn't matter that much :D
<KrazyNoobs> YOU ALMOST HIT FLUTTERSHY! :[
<Snowden> America is America.
<Socks> I see the title just before watching it anyways
<jcelios> ...
<Snowden> thats about all there is to say
<adasdad> HURHURHUR IT STARTS WITH A LETTER BETWEEN A AND Z
<jcelios> SNAPE KILLS CELESTIA
<adasdad> AND THE PHYREXIANS INVADE
<Socks> Spoiler alert snape kills trinity with rosebud
<NullRadix> wait... I thought Snape was luna's father?
<Snowden> applejack is really a pegasus
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: yeah, it was
<adasdad> nullradix: she is, and luna is celestias daughter...
<Eli> adasdad: do you play magic on steam too?
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, I don't like the double standards that go on in my country either. All I can do is try to deal with my own and call out other people who are using it without shame.
<Saturn> 08,01as i say, the only reason it was is because it was a word that i associate with my own experiences of being bullied as a kid
<Snowden> whos playin', btw?
<adasdad> eli: nope :\
<Kandarihu> Snowden, Shizuka
<Snowden> coolio
<Socks> Saturn: I agree with you, it's a word with a very dark history :(
<Eli> adasdad: aww... you should get it it's cheaper atm
<adasdad> Y SO MUCH HAX
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: Yeah, I can sort of understand that. (not fully, as I never went through it myself)
<adasdad> infinite ammo rpg op nerf pls
<Snowden> WHA-poom
<Kandarihu> The whole N words privilege is a blatant double standard. Either non-black people should be allowed to say it, or nobody.
<Socks> Just Cause 2 is like a game where all the hax are turned on at the start
<Socks> Kandarihu: Don't go there, just saying.
<adasdad> ^
<Socks> Please :'(
<Snowden> Tis' be sensitive territory
<Socks> No one will come out of it looking good
<Snowden> also, *ride of the valkeries*
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: And I know how hard it is when you're bullied over stuff like that, I had a hard time culturally in my first school over here 4 years ago, and was bullied because of that.
<adasdad> for some reason, the map reminds me of bionicle
<Socks> ^
<jcelios> I got my dad a nosehair trimmer for christmas :P
<Barbetos> All dem km
<Socks> jcelios: XD
<adasdad> LOGIC
<Kandarihu> Socks, I almost never come out of ANYTHING looking good.
<Snowden> one might say its a... Bye-plane
<Saturn> 08,01i was mostly bullied in primary school for being indian
<TrixieMuffin> *flight of the bumblebee*
<Barbetos> tuk tuk boom lol
<adasdad> tuktuk boom ius best vehicle
<Bogy> oh.. i got banned from 4chan for 3 days...... :D
<Saturn> 08,01but i was bullied when i was in boarding school for a year (secondary) for being Scottish ( i was in an english school)
<Snowden> lol wut
<Socks> Once I went up as high as you could go in this game, jumped out of the helicoptor, got back in, started up the engine and flew away and it was well epic :P
<Barbetos> lol
<Barbetos> NICE
<Barbetos> dat ai
<Bronysith> Saturn: well i got stabbed in the arm for reading
<adasdad> ?
<jcelios> damn literates!
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: :(
<Barbetos> Did your reading material also get stabbed?
<Socks> Saturn: You went to boarding school! Ouch :(
<Saturn> 08,01people are stupid
<Socks> ^^^^
<KrazyNoobs> ^
<Socks> SO MUCH ^^^^^
<Saturn> 08,01Socks: i loved being in a boarding school, mostly
<KrazyNoobs> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<adasdad> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<Snowden> Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
<Eli> Socks: boarding schools are great
<Socks> Saturn: I can't even stand the idea of them, but I'm sorry you were bullied :(
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: Huge culture shock, small village in Africa to a town in the UK... It showed pretty quickly, and some people decided they didn't like that I talked funny, acted weird, and was smarter than them.
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: That, what you said back there, was the smartest thing I have heard anypony say... EVER
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a very independent person, and being in a boardin school when i was 14 was the first time i could really explore that
<Barbetos> People are stupid? Or inteligent enough to make it hurt? The brain?
<Saturn> 08,01well, 13/14
<Uakh_> shit happens...I got bullied on an island because I was born on the continent...and on the continent I was considered "weird" because I had lived all my life on said island. fml
<Bronysith> Saturn: indeed, i was reading chronicles of narnia in 8th grade, and this bitch comes up and snags the book out of my hand, so i ask "give it back please" she says "no i wanna see it," so i snatch it back and she fucking stabs me
<Bronysith> goddamn i hated middle school t~T
*Socks didn't mean to force his views about boarding schools on anyone else, I am very sorry.
<adasdad> bronysith: with what?
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: I went to boarding school from (UK) year 4 to 8, in senegal
<KrazyNoobs> It was in Year 6 that kids suddenly became a jerk to me.
<Socks> I don't like the idea of not being able to get out of a boarding school. Feeling trapped in, scares me :(
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: wow, why wer eyou there?
<Snowden> i spent school years k-3 in a k-12 school overseas learning new words
<Uakh> sup Phase4
<Phase4> ohai Uakh
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: You don't know the story? Ah.
<Sumica> 00,10bleh, so tired
<Uakh> long time no see :D
*Bronysith glomps Phase4 into Sumica
<KrazyNoobs> hi sumica
<Socks> Phase4: So, you're a mod now.
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: i do not, no
*Ponies47 sits on Sumica's head
<adasdad> GOTTA GO FAST
<Phase4> Socks, i'm a mod now :P
<Snowden> walking around at the speed of DIAGNOL
<Socks> Phase4: Nice one :) COngratulatibitorianies or some such
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: I grew up in Senegal, West Africa, until I was 13
*adasdad ponies 47 on head's sumica
<String_Shredder> "well i got stabbed in the arm for reading" Don't you dare fucking read on my turf again. Don't fuck with the Reading Rainbows, bitch!
<Socks> String_Shredder: Were you assulted by twilight?
<Bronysith> String_Shredder: T~T
<Uakh> SafariMonkey: nice, do you like speak fancy and stuff ?
<adasdad> this is MY book, and I'M GOING TO CUT YOU!
*Bronysith suplexes String_Shredder into hot fudge
<NullRadix> String_Shredder: fanfic about why rainbow dash was previously afraid of reading?
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: I guess that's the basics of it. (Oh, and my mum's faroese and my dad's cornish)
<KrazyNoobs> lol dem doors
<KrazyNoobs> :D
<adasdad> silly car, you aren't a bird
<Socks> I whip my doors back n' forth
<Sumica> 00,10just 2 more days of this shift and I am done
<adasdad> was that a typo?
<Snowden> possibry
<Uakh> Phase4: do you think I will actually ever get -b from #geek ? It's getting old you know.
<SafariMonkey> Uakh: Yeah, I'm fluent in fancy (speaking age ~8-12)
<KrazyNoobs> Wall-E won the movie A? That was my last week selection
<Yahooz> yes he is
<KrazyNoobs> Wall-E is actually a good movie, despite the normal stuff being crap.
<Socks> We're watching Wall-E! nice!
<Socks> <3 Wall-E
<KrazyNoobs> Pixar makes awesome movies.
<Socks> ^
<Uakh> haven't watched wall-e yet
<Phase4> Uakh, i think it was a perm ban, i'll ask if you want
<Sumica> 00,10meh, most the actors seemed too robodic
<Bronysith> Socks: ill be working, i wont be able to watch high budget animation T~T
<Uakh> when is it again ?
*Bronysith suplexes Socks into laundry
<Uakh> Phase4: thx
<Uakh> still don't know why I was banned tbh
<Snowden> firetruck stops for no car
*Socks stabs Bronysith out of pity
*Bronysith heals his wound and raging lions Socks
<Bronysith> yay~
<Socks> Uakh: U was banned :(
<KrazyNoobs> Pixar still makes awesome movies, despite the other kids-movie companies surrendering to unfunny potty humor and being unoriginal.
*Socks dodged
<Uakh> outside of big-K being pissed for having a bad day
*Socks doesn't like potty humour, tis lazy
<KrazyNoobs> Dreamworks has lost every single bit of its goodness over the 15 years.
<Socks> HTTYD was good...
<Bronysith> KrazyNoobs: last good movie was shrek 1
<KrazyNoobs> ^
<Kandarihu> Sumica, how is your shift going to affect your streaming of BMN?
<SafariMonkey> Uakh: BTW, by fancy I mean French: I'm using applejack's translation.
<KrazyNoobs> How to train your dragon, i would have to admit, was good.
<Bronysith> KrazyNoobs: even then they ripped off aladdin
<Uakh> when's Shrek 5 coming out ?
<Uakh> SafariMonkey: I got it
<Sumica> 00,10It wont effect BMN
<Bronysith> Sumica: *affect
<Uakh> I'm mostly fluent in fancy myself
<Bronysith> ?
<Socks> THere's a fifth one T-T
<SafariMonkey> :P
<texasboykc09> hello everypony
*Bronysith huggles Socks "i know that feel"
<KrazyNoobs> Uakh: Only Shrek 1 was good, the sequel (2) was not as good, 3 and up were crappy in my opinion.
<Snowden> there making an Enders Game movie
<KrazyNoobs> Despicable Me was also pretty damn good.
<Socks> HTTYD!
<Bronysith> Snowden: that book was fucked up beyond belief
<Socks> How to train your dragon for those who can be bothered to type
<Eli> KrazyNoobs: i hope 2 gets just as good
<Uakh> KrazyNoobs: hence why I was asking. Bad movies are like a train wreck. Watch The Son of the Mask for instance
<texasboykc09> is Shizuka streaming
<KrazyNoobs> Eli: Nope, Dreamworks always f---s up on sequels.
<Kandarihu> So what then, Sumica? Will you just have a playlist running automatically?
<Snowden> Bronysith: yes, but i want to see how they transfer it to the movies, cuz, yo know, dead 8 year olds and such
<Eli> KrazyNoobs: let me hope. if they fuck up HTTYD 2 i'm gonna bomb them
<Socks> Snowden: Da whut...
<Sumica> 00,10no, the shift wont start till almost midnight
<Uakh> HTTYD?
<Cypresswolf> texasboykc09: who else is capable of such carnage? :P
<KrazyNoobs> SON OF THE MASK... worst movie ever.
<Bronysith> Snowden: "meet ender, an 18 year old who all his life wanted to join the military" problem solved
<Uakh> KrazyNoobs: I have it on DVD ! :D
<Bronysith> Snowden: only japan can get away with killing people under the age of 15
<texasboykc09> Sumica, what shift
<Bronysith> Snowden: see, evangelion, and lots of other animes >.>
<Socks> Sumica: Are you too old for this *pfft* shift :D
<Barbetos> Shizuka are we there yet!?
<Barbetos> D=
<Kandarihu> ...oh. I totally forgot to factor in that Sumica's in a different time zone from me. :P
<Socks> Oh I am hilarious
<KrazyNoobs> But really, Son Of The Mask has no audience, as it is innapropriate for little kids, and the people who are allowed to watch it will find it annoying and stupid.
<Barbetos> Oh god. That place
<Barbetos> I alway seem to get stuck there fighting in this game
<Snowden> Bronysith: Ender is played by Asa Butterfield, from Hugo and the Boy in striped pajamas, so i think they are sticking with fairly young
<texasboykc09> Sumica, will you be here for the new ep.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Have any Ponies Influenced You Personally?

<Sumica> 00,10I personalt wont
<KrazyNoobs> or not
<Sumica> 00,10but that wont stop me from remote streaming it
<Bronysith> Snowden: aight, but you know, they might change cause of that recent shit that happened in america >.>
<Snowden> Bronysith: true, but i have a little hope
<KrazyNoobs> The only bad movie that Pixas has ever made was Toy Story 3.
<KrazyNoobs> *Pixar
<KrazyNoobs> Toy Story 2 was good for a sequel.
<KrazyNoobs> But my fav will always be 1.
<Bronysith> of course
<Sumica> 00,10but what about toystory 4
<Barbetos> u gawt a france in me!
<Bronysith> KrazyNoobs: even then toy story 3 is better than any dreamworks movie
<Sumica> 00,10the quest for more franchising
<Socks> KrazyNoobs: Da fuq u sayin'!
<Uakh> KrazyNoobs: really ? I found it enjoyable. I heard the only bad pixar ws actually the-one-with-the-scottish-girl-I-just-can't-remember-the-name-of
<Bronysith> Snowden: seriously, whats with america and shit going down? schools being shot up and all that shit T~T
<KrazyNoobs> Sumica: Are they making that? I haven't seen any commercials, because in Australia, movies are like 6 months behind 'murica.
<Kandarihu> Brave?
*Socks cried during toy story 3 TWT
<KrazyNoobs> Uakh: brave?
<Barbetos> Brave
<Sumica> 00,10it's still in development hell
<Socks> Cars 2 is worst
<Barbetos> Yeah. I did not watch it
<KrazyNoobs> cars 2 was horrible.
<KrazyNoobs> i'm sorry
<KrazyNoobs> it was
<Barbetos> I never watched cars 2 either.
<Socks> Brave was a commercial flop wasn't it?
<Barbetos> Sumica Duke Nukem Forever?
<KrazyNoobs> I should just say that Toy Story 1/2, Monsters Inc., the Incredibles and Wall-E are my favs by Pixar.
<Socks> No wonder they're doing sequals now :(
<JRP> Moo
<Snowden> Bronysith: Who knows? Not only is the incident itself bad, but the publicity is even worse. the 26 people who died did not include the wife, then theres Videogames, and god knows what else
<Uakh> Brave had a bow. Bows are cool. Only thing that held me back from going to my local theater to watch it was the flak critics gave it.
<Bronysith> Snowden: of course they had to shoehorn in "videogames are bad" bullshit excuse
<Snowden> also, IMDB has confirmed that Toy Story 4 is announced
<Socks> What else can they do with the series?
<CriticKitten> Sumi: And hopefully it stays there. Toy Story 3 was a perfect cap to the trilogy. >_>
<JRP> O shit
<Socks> It finished
<Socks> ENDED!
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, these sorts of things happen in other countries too. It's just that it doesn't get the media circus unless it happens in countries like America. I guess mass killings get media coverage in Japan, too.
<Sumica> 00,10so I have come to the conclusion just cause 2 takes place in the island that tropaco takes place in
<Snowden> Bronysith: appearently he liked Mass Effect 2 days earlier, which *cough* explains everything *cough*
<Barbetos> that was AWESOME
<Socks> Done with it ended really well
<Bronysith> Snowden: cause you know, every american is a good person but was "easily infulenced by something else to turn them into coldhearted killers, videogames do this all the time" or how about "possessed by satan"
<KrazyNoobs> I very much dislike when a "big movie" company remakes classics. (ie Alvin and the Chipmunks)
<JRP> SuperBrony64: moo
<CriticKitten> Alvin and the Chipmunks? Bleh.
<Snowden> Bronysith: also, the media thought it was his brother for the first week and a half or something
<Bronysith> Snowden: but as soon as they are muslim or outside america, they are cold blooded people who deserve to die, why dont they blame the shit in iraq on video games? its bullshit
<CriticKitten> First one was bad enough, why did people go see it enough to merit a sequel? D:<
<Uakh> KrazyNoobs: that's like when a video game company makes a game of a movie...sometimes it's good...sometimes...
<KrazyNoobs> ET
<KrazyNoobs> Atari
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> hey does any1 know how the process of corrupting cynder came about?
<KrazyNoobs> :[
<Cypresswolf> I like how she glides effortlessly through the trees :D
<Uakh> no
<Barbetos> Everyone should buy Just Cause 2.
<Socks> The HP games were ok
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> like did they just put her in the beam
<Uakh> ET is taboo
<Bronysith> Snowden: america cant just accept that kids are bullied like hell or that the parents suck or something cause "everyone is a great person" T~T, god i hate this countries logic
<Barbetos> Becuase Just Cause 2 MP is in development
<RoboGerbil> this game is way over the top
<Barbetos> And when it finally releases...
<KrazyNoobs> E.T, the game. That was the game that ran Atari out of business.
<Bronysith> Barbetos: i need to get windows 7 to play just cause 2 T~T
<AdamTheDuck> RoboGerbil, over the top? Nevah.
<Snowden> Bronysith: America is America, home of free speech and free guns
