<Dman> "Pokémon is actually set in an alternate universe where Japan used its Pokémon to win World War II. After that the government began harvesting the natural resources of other countries, which is how everything is so technologically advanced and free."
<Dman> "Nobody speaks about it because it would ruin the illusion of a perfect utopia. Since it was the war to end all wars, fighting is highly looked down upon which is why people have Pokémon battles instead. "
<Dman> "Remember Lt. Surge? He betrayed America by giving Japan access to its power grids, in exchange for safe passage to Japan. "

<JackiePie> Do you have delicious cookies set on your browser?
<AllisZero> Godballs
<AllisZero> Bluetooth is a pain
<Spazturtle> Forgot LotR stream was tommorow
<Efreet> It's tracking you. Your internet knows too much. Eliminate it, Closet_Brony.

<AllisZero> I think the only reason it is still what it is
<Nostalgia> 7i'm gonna try guildwars 2

<Dermathil> >mfw the nostalgia critic review of Duck Tales cemented my memories of the episodes I got on VHS
<KShrike> But not here :P
<Daz> it looks like doom from googleimages
<LightDasher> safebooru
<SillyNilly|Sketch> It works for Google Documents, e621.net and Ponibooru.
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Bronibooru as well maybe, I haven't tested it out yet.
<LightDasher> !link http://safebooru.org/index.php?page=post&s=view&id=136396
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<Daz> well i'll try deus ex at some point

<Rodman> Muppets, hell yeah!
<Dermathil> either pokemons or Duck Tales!!!!
<KShrike> I mean, I am always nervous to click ponibooru links...
<Nuclear> ?!?!
<Daz> both sound good to me
<Dermathil> eeeyup
<Rodman> Rocko's! Play Rocko!
<Dermathil> Duck Tales was very good back in its time
<KShrike> safebooru could easily contain nsfw that hasn't been pulled down yet.
<Spazturtle> yay
<Rodman> Pokemon
<Rodman> I'mokwiththis.jpg
<JackiePie> Safebooru, still with upskirt!
<KShrike> unless it works differently.
<JackiePie> ;)
<Dermathil> You'd be okay with Duck Tales too I think.
<LightDasher> even then, I wouldn't be looking for those images on safebooru
<Daz> i'mveryokwiththis.jpg

<MrPoniator> And look who posted it there
<Spazturtle> OMGYAY
<Rodman> PUNCH IT!
<Dermathil> >mfw we missed the TEAM ROCKET EPISODE
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Yup. It's a nice animation.
<Rodman> DAT CAP!
<Spazturtle> EP3: Ash Catches A Pokémon
<Rodman> Headshot
<Dermathil> where be episode two?!
<Spazturtle> "Ash, Pikachu and Misty have entered the Viridian Forest. Ash has spotted a Caterpie and thrown a Pokéball at it. Capturing it, Ash is overjoyed at his first catch. Misty, however, hates bugs and screams every time it comes near her."
<LightDasher> I was drawing a picture of Rarity wearing Litchi's outfit
<MrPoniator> The character select thing got deleted when someone posted it around the time it was posted on EqD
<MrPoniator> Which I can agree with, since it was flippin' 7MB swf for something so simple
<Spazturtle> I cried when butterfree left
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> same
<AllisZero> How about when Charizard left?
<LightDasher> what did It do?
<Dermathil> Q_Q
<Rodman> Not only when Charizard left, but what he did when he decided to stay.....
<Spazturtle_> How dare flash crash on me
<MrPoniator> Eh, just some character select flash I made mimic BlazBlue's own
<Rodman> SRS Q_Q
<Dermathil> >yfw Charizard came back in one of the moview
<Dermathil> *movies
<LightDasher> ah
<LightDasher> the wheel of fate is turning
<Rodman> The first one methinks
<Tiles> Oh hey, new celebrity.
<Rodman> Never to be seen again
<MrPoniator> Who?
<Dermathil> nah
<Tiles> Yoohooo, MrPoniator ;p
<Dermathil> not the first movie
<AllisZero> I swear, I think I can prove that the hotter the girl is, the stupider she gets
<MrPoniator> :U
<Spazturtle_> "Finally arrived in Viridian City, Ash is cornered by Officer Jenny who asks why he is carrying Pikachu instead of having it in a Pokéball."
<Dermathil> I think it was the 3rd movie
<MrPoniator> Do I get 'em fillies now?
<Lawdee> Gday
<Tiles> And to think I knew you when you were a wee fcoal.
<Tiles> foal(*
<MrPoniator> Heh

<Rodman> WAZ DAT IN YOU POKET!
<KShrike> It's another one of those "set in the future" ones... ugh...
<KShrike> I can't read those ever. Every time, I feel like I'm forcing myself to read it.
<Rodman> In retrospective
<Dermathil> OOOH YEAAAH
<KShrike> Not his, I haven't read his yet
<Rodman> Ash's voice actor is terrible
<Lawdee> I've been told i'm good at writing but I shall never do it out of free will :s
<Spazturtle_> "cannot be replaced" dosn't he get a new one at some time?
<KShrike> But those kinds of fics.
<Dermathil> SUDDENLY MISTY
<Tiles> I was watching it, then I noticed the name.
<Dermathil> yes, Spaz.
<Tiles> "MrPoniator! I know the guy!" xD
<Dermathil> But only with a better model.
<MrPoniator> Haha
<KShrike> Read my first "Human in Equestria".
<Tiles> Wish I was famous :3
<KShrike> I had to force my way to read half of it, and it was rewarding because the second half was kind of good.
<Tiles> But the only thing I'm moderately famous (if famous at all) is my winter wrap up cover.
<MrPoniator> Well, some might recknognize me even further if I post my old nick here, but I'll choose not to

<MrPoniator> Laters
<GGgala> it took him four days? what was he /doing?/
<Spazturtle_> Dumb pidgey
<Nostalgia> 7got hold up in the dungeons
<Dermathil> he had special tastes in pokemon... care.
<Rodman> Just like Ash, he found gurls in the forest.
<Rodman> Then he took his time
<GGgala> wait, the three birds, and.... what?
<Dermathil> >mfw
<Dermathil> lawl
<Daz> haha
<Rodman> Oh Oak, you card
<GGgala> Ash's Mom gossips faster than light apparently
<Rodman> Dat dialogue
<Spazturtle_> One more question, are you a boy or girl?
<Dermathil> HAHAHA
<ShadTheCrazed> I'm downloading more poni, along with some awesome game tracks.
<RainBroDash> WHO'S STREAMING THIS
<Dermathil> Sathi
<MrPoniator> What game tracks?
<RainBroDash> 10Sathi you are a god
<Rodman> Dash was busy
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Hello ShadTheCrazed
<ShadTheCrazed> Xenoblade.
<LightDasher> I have so many desktop ponies running around I can't see my screen
<Dermathil> PIZZA
<GGgala> ...how can Oak see that? the camera isn't facing it!
<Daz> Now now RainBroDash
<MrPoniator> Xenoblade interests me a bit
<Rodman> HIS PIZZA!
<ShadTheCrazed> SillyNilly|Sketch: Yo.
<Dermathil> SMOKEY
<Nostalgia> 7magic I aint gonna explain shit
<RainBroDash> 10ITS PIKACHU
<MrPoniator> But I really need to finish some games first before buying new ones
<Dermathil> YAY KOFFING
<Rodman> Ninja Misty, out of fucking nowhere
<RainBroDash> 10GODDAMN YOU
<Daz> Suckas, it's always chuck norris
<Lawdee> Damnit lunasta
<Spazturtle_> Funny think is that in a latter season you see that his pokédex recorded seeing that pokemon
<Lawdee> Why are you always in front of me
<ShadTheCrazed> MrPoniator: Like beating Gaycheese in Pokemon B/W? o wo
<Lawdee> I just have to spend some time here and I'm in front of him :D
<Rodman> She's got some muscles to have been going around carrying that thing
<MrPoniator> I haven't played Pokemon since Ruby
<Dermathil> >yfw he don't 'til the end of S2
<ShadTheCrazed> Oh.
<Ali1017> He wasn't that hard.
<RainBroDash> 10>yfw the GS ball was never followed up
<Lawdee> I haven't played any pokemon since diamond
<Rodman> Lvl 1 Pikachu, OF COURSE HE'S NO GOOD YET!
<ShadTheCrazed> I can agree that 4th gen pretty much sucked.
<Dermathil> eeeyup RBD
<RainBroDash> 10oh god, so much Pogeymans
<Daz> lvl5 *
<Dermathil> It should have
<MrPoniator> I just kind of dropped out after Ruby
<Rodman> Lvl 5?
<Rodman> Goddamn Ash
<ShadTheCrazed> But the good thing about it is the new game mechanics that changed Pokemon forever.
<Ali1017> 5th gen wasn't that great, the names really slacked in B/W
<Rodman> You suck balls
<Daz> hahaha
<Ali1017> Way to short in my opinion.
<ShadTheCrazed> Ali1017: I can relate. I still buy the games, none-the-less.
<ShadTheCrazed> *rainbow dash shrug*
<Dermathil> >yfw no black outfit yetters
<MrPoniator> Funnily enough I still enjoy the heck out of Monster HUnter
<Dermathil> MEOWTH
<Ali1017> I have every copy of the RPG, just B/W felt, lacking in places.
<GGgala> dat steam chat
<MrPoniator> Which is essentially just like Pokemon, in that it's just rehashes itself over and over
<Rodman> >Has radar systems connected to the city's PSA system
<Rodman> >No air force
<Spazturtle_> I a latter EP you can hear James saying "4Kids are the devil"
<ShadTheCrazed> Yeah.
<ShadTheCrazed> I plan on making a game when I learn how to make video games.
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Rodman> Which ep is it?
<ShadTheCrazed> Hopefully it'll have a few Brony references in it.
<Rodman> Spaz?
<Spazturtle_> Can't remember
<MrPoniator> Gotta get back to work with a game o' mine now that the flash is done
<Ali1017> It was far to linear, no real places to explore, and a lot of pokemon with horrid stats or bad movepools.
<MrPoniator> I'll likely put some brony references to it through hidden objects and dialogue
<Dermathil> TAKE THE STAFF
<ShadTheCrazed> Indeed.
<Rodman> >Not interested in electric rat
<Rodman> >Follow same kid for ten years
<MrPoniator> Since I just found out that the artist buddy of mine also likes MLP, so I'm sure he doesn't mind, lol
<CogWeaver> test
<CogWeaver> test test
<Dermathil> Koffing is such a dunce
<MrPoniator> And how we already put an obscure Phoenix Wright reference
<CogWeaver> test
<MrPoniator> testy test?
<JackiePie> Shad what kind of game are you planning on making?
<Rodman> Koffing be derping
<Lawdee> It works
<GGgala> PIKA POWER
<ShadTheCrazed> Here's an example of what I mean: "My sword? Could be about twenty percent cooler."
<Lawdee> I think
<Closet_Brony> From ponibooru to DevART
<ShadTheCrazed> JackiePie: 3D platformer adventure game.
<JackiePie> nice
<RainBroDash> 10pikapikachuchu
<Daz> KOFFI http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/halolz-dot-com-pokemon-koffing-coffee-comic.gif
<Closet_Brony> WHAT?
<ShadTheCrazed> If possible.
<Rodman> I'm pretty sure that can classify as animal torture
<Closet_Brony> Only one pic?
<Dermathil> PEWTER CITY
<RainBroDash> 10lol dman
<Rodman> I don't remember Pewter
<Lawdee> Awesome
<MrPoniator> I'm working on an adventure puzzle platformer in Flash, a couple of visual novels in Unity, and a hybrid of 2D RPG and 2D fighting games sometimes
<Dermathil> dat pidgey
<ShadTheCrazed> Cool.
<GGgala> Rodman; it's the city RIGHT after Viridian
<Rodman> He's like FUCK THIS SHIT!
<Dermathil> RATATA
<ShadTheCrazed> Hopefully I can fit a combo system in my game, though.
<Dermathil> >mfw I remember it
<Rodman> Hey, haven't played a Pokemon game in ages
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<Dermathil> STARI
<GGgala> it's the Rock Gym of course :p
<MrPoniator> If you just dedicate yourself to it, I'm sure you can
<Dermathil> *STARY
<Daz> Dermathil: reminded of this: http://jamesbnyc.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/ratatatata.jpg
<Rodman> RATATA, USE THE FEAR TACTIC!
<ShadTheCrazed> With a few special combos only for certain colors of swords.
<ShadTheCrazed> Here's an example of what I mean:
<RainBroDash> 10dat trash talk
<Dermathil> lol Goldeen
<Rodman> She'll kill them with the sheer WTFness
<GGgala> >"warming up"
<GGgala> >"looking like an idiot to stall"
<Rodman> DAT INNUENDO
<ShadTheCrazed> Say you recolored your sword to be light blue with a few different colors along with it. Rack up enough combos and you can cause something like a Sonic Rainboom, only smaller, and with knockback force.
<Dermathil> PIKA PIKA
<Rodman> And that dumbass
<ShadTheCrazed> But not exactly like one.
<Dermathil> AHAHAHAHAHAHA
<MrPoniator> Coolio
<Spazturtle_> Warming up a warter pokemon seems like a bad ider
<Rodman> Unless you're making Sushi
<RainBroDash> 10I wanna do a nuzlocke run of a pokemon game now. But what to play
<Dermathil> POKEMON YELLOW
<Daz> nuzlocke? can only be RBY RainBroDash
<ShadTheCrazed> The main character of said game is a 13-year-old who is known as Andre, but his nickname is Shad.
<Daz> :D
<RainBroDash> 10I was tempted to go for emerald for the lulz
<Daz> Yellow indeed, Dermathil
<Rodman> How the fuck does that even work?!
<Closet_Brony> http://static.reddit.com/ads/usb-flash-drives1.jpg Jesus with a Sharpie.... I dunno whether to be excited of terrified
<RainBroDash> 10but RBY sounds like a plan
<ShadTheCrazed> Andre is like, the me I wish I was.
<Daz> Doo eet!
<RainBroDash> 10I think I'll go for yellow :D
<Daz> I'll confess i've never done a nuzlocke run though : /
<Dermathil> RBD, STREAM IT
<Rodman> Koffing just jizzed himself
<Daz> but if I were to, it would be Blue
<RainBroDash> 10my upload is way too low here at my dad's
<RainBroDash> 10I'd do it at my mum's house
<Daz> : /
<MrPoniator> Heh, I never understood reddit that much
*GGgala just looked up what 'nuzlocke' means
<RainBroDash> 10Might start streaming some lets plays of pokemon if the demand is there xD
<RainBroDash> 10GGgala want a link?
<GGgala> ohh
<GGgala> i got it
<RainBroDash> 10I can upload the extended rules for it
<GGgala> http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nuzlocke_Challenge
<GGgala> ? extended?
<Rodman> How all those morons just survived, I have no idea
<Rodman> PIKACHU! MURDER IT!
<Closet_Brony> That looks like a pic I would've tooken while unconcious
<RainBroDash> 10There are like up to 15 rules that you can include/exclude if you feel like making it harder
<PK_Sleep> Help convince me that I'm going to kick my class' asses today
<Closet_Brony> Explanation of that : Magicsnortsnort.avi
<RainBroDash> 10but unfortunately I don't have my old /tr/ folder on here
<Daz> Everybrony: Anyone ever played Dwarf Fortress?
<PK_Sleep> 50 minute biology lecture, 90 minute network security lab (absolutely terrified about), 2 hour biology lab
<Rodman> Guilty here Daz
<RainBroDash> 10just remembered I'm not on my desktop PC XD
<Daz> I haven't btw
<Closet_Brony> PK_Sleep: You're gonna kic your classes asses!
<RainBroDash> 10I haven't
<Daz> Rodman: is it good?
<ShadTheCrazed> Andre explores his home planet along with his father, and they bothj end up making new friends, along with enemies. The ultimate goal, however, is to discover the truth about said planet.
<PK_Sleep> yay
<Rodman> I'll tell you this much
<Rodman> Holy. Shit.
<Spazturtle_> gota bo be back latter
<Rodman> I mean, its very simple looking
<RainBroDash> 10cya spazturtle
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Rodman> But the gameplay is extremely hard (atleast for me)
<ShadTheCrazed> He makes new friends and new enemies along the way, as something deep inside the planet threaten's the universe's existence.
<GGgala> crap, i got cut off
<ShadTheCrazed> *threatens
<RainBroDash> 10rodman apparently it has an absurd learning curve
<Closet_Brony> Downloads done... time for some dungeons of Dredmor... LAter everypony
<Rodman> So if you play it, you might want to start with a small map or something of the sort
<ShadTheCrazed> Can he save the universe, along with still being able to uncover the truth about his planet and ancestors? Find out about 20 years from now.
<Dermathil> let's watch duck tales for the nostalgia factor!!!
<ShadTheCrazed> Oh ho ho ho.
<Rodman> Though one of my friends is quite good at it and apparently likes to flood the map with magma to kill all the enemies while his dwarfs are safe underground
<Rodman> Don't ask
<Daz> Rodman: i've heard it's the most complex game ever, and pretty much 100% of visuals has to be imagined through the ASCII so using imagination - that's my kinda game! I've yet to play though
*Dermathil gos to shave
<Rodman> Your kind of game eh
<Rodman> Then I take it you're also a fan of Paradox games, right?
<Daz> paradox?
<GGgala> http://www.paradoxgames.com/ Daz
<SillyNilly|Sketch> !seen Ivan2294
<DerpyBot> SillyNilly|Sketch: The last time I saw Ivan2294 was Sun 17 Jul 2011 10:17:05 AM CEST

<FallSilently> Well that was an excellent movie.
<Daz> by 'my kind of game' i didn't mean i've played before, but rather, I like that sorta thing. like getting 'emotionally attached' to essencially what is data :P and imagining a huge world happening at once
<GGgala> that's the paradox games i could find
*FallSilently was watching Moon
<Daz> uumm
<Daz> http://www.paradoxplaza.com/

<Rodman> Those guys basically specialize with grand-strategy games Daz
<Daz> GGgala hmm. maybe cuz i'm 'google.es'? eyedunnolol
<FallSilently> Soon, we shall outnumber the full mods. Then, we shall be unstoppable.
<Daz> i see Rodman. but no, i've never really played that sorta game, it just sounds like a game i'd like. I'm no gamer, trust me :P i barely played much
<Balloons> Oh no :O
<EdwardNewgate> NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW!
<Lawdee> Waaagh I'm bored
<RainBroDash> 10aaah Daz I have 24 pokemon ROMs on this pc. I'm stuck for choice again now
<Dermathil> YAY THE DUCK TALES
<RainBroDash> 10;____;
<Rodman> Daz
<Rodman> You might want to read this then
<Rodman> http://lparchive.org/Paradox-Hohenzollern/
<FallSilently> You should watch Moon. It's a great movie. I'll show you where to download it:
<Balloons> Now it is even :)

<Rodman> But I guarantee, its awesome
<Lawdee> Fudge my typing today
<Daz> okie
<Lawdee> I blame my cat
<FallSilently> He's waiting for me to !moon him.
<Rodman> And reading the after-action report is lolz-worthy
<RainBroDash> 10But Daz I could be playing Emerald 386! It's a version of Emerald where all 386 pokemon appear in the wild, and it's slightly harder
<Dermathil> wasn't there a Duck Tales Movie?
<FallSilently> Yet I am benevolent.
<Balloons> Now we have 6 ops and 6 half ops. Nice and Organised :)
<FallSilently> For I know he'll do horrible things to me if I do.
<Lawdee> Aha
<Rodman> That moron is ruining equipment
<Daz> ...RainBroDash i remember that...was very good ... Hmm ... Emerald 386 with /strict/ rules will be a legendary Nuzlocke
<Rodman> And commiting murder
<Lawdee> Now you can
<Lawdee> 't
<Lawdee> Fudge
<Balloons> :D
<RainBroDash> 10aah i don't know ;__;

<Daz> YES! RainBroDash yes
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Yay?

<RainBroDash> 10Dman I'll keep you updated, screenshots when something important happens
<RainBroDash> 10This is gonna be great:)
<Daz> Make sure to dramatise the story! your feelings, what was around you, your pokemon's emotions, everything!
<Dermathil> lawl
<Dermathil> visual joke
<Rodman> And do tell which pokemons you'll be using
<Daz> as the story goes, we'll see which ones are used :P
<Dermathil> wait,
<Dermathil> isn't yellow the easiest
<RainBroDash> 10for nuzlocke? Maybe
<Dermathil> due to getting the other three starters?
<Daz> sorta yea... you're given pokemon. but still! it'll be such an experience!
<RainBroDash> 10ah shit yeah didn't think of that
<RainBroDash> 10hmm
<Daz> RainBroDash, i don't mind if you do, infact i'd say do it! your first nuzlocke
<Daz> 1 poke per gym, PLUS the free ones u're given if you want. OR the free ones count as the 'pokepergym'
<RainBroDash> 10I've done nuzlockes before, mainly of emerald
<Rodman> If its your first, go easy on yourself then
<Daz> either way, i'd say yellow first
<Daz> well up to you then
<RainBroDash> 10I've done fire red, silver, emerald I think
<RainBroDash> 10silver was great
<VampirePrincess> hey i made it in!

<^Scootaloo> Okayz
<^Scootaloo> Leave it like that
<^Scootaloo> :3
<CogWeaver> :P
<Dawn> They actually re-released the game because people were unable to beat the game.
<CogWeaver> there, leave it like that
<Aristeo> rawr!
<SladeJT> ?
<ShadTheCrazed> I'd just give all the mane six a giant group hug with my giant hands. <3
<CogWeaver> o_O?
<RainbowDash> Aww come on, I wanted that topic to last longer than that.
<Dawn> If they are three feet tall, and 1/3 as wide as that..
<Locke> Challenge accepted game!
<Dawn> You would need 12 foot arms.
*Balloons has changed the topic to: Celestia is Awesome :D
<Tiles> Topic war? :\
<SladeJT> What game?
<Tiles> You guys are better than that.
<VampirePrincess> mew....
<JackiePie> Hi
<ShadTheCrazed> dawn: I can fix that.
<Tiles> Ok so you aren't.
*VampirePrincess hugs ari
*ShadTheCrazed adds rubber to my arms
<CogWeaver> it wasn't a full blown WAR
<VampirePrincess> hihi
<RainbowDash> It was just a brief joke anyway
<CogWeaver> it was more of a skirmish than anything
*Aristeo hugs VampirePrincess back
<Aristeo> How's you?
<Dawn> So I just watched Rocky Horror Picture Show...
<Locke> Devil May Cry 3. I will defeat you!
<ShadTheCrazed> Well, I think I'll try to eat something with my sore throat, and work on Luna the Absol.
<VampirePrincess> okies. just waiting for cookie to wake up
<Aristeo> Cookie?
<JackiePie> Soup is good for a sore throat
<VampirePrincess> my man.
<VampirePrincess> :)
<Aristeo> oooooh
*Aristeo rubs her eyes sleepily
<SladeJT> Anyone ever have a really weird idea that they just have to get out as much as possible?
<Aristeo> erm
<Aristeo> his*
<VampirePrincess> lololololol
<CogWeaver> uh...?
<Aristeo> That's what happens when you RP girl characters
<VampirePrincess> lololololol
<AllisZero> I'M NOT GONNA CRY AT WORK
<SladeJT> <-- had like 2 hours of sleep so sorry if sound weird or confuses
<AllisZero> FUUUUUU
<VampirePrincess> hey i'll bbl goin 2 hang with a friend
<FallSilently> Where did the idea that Derpy lives with Carrot Top come from?
*Taggerung is in the same boat as SladeJT
<VioletVanilla> L3
<Dawn> That's OK. I'm still a little hungover.
<Dawn> Darn pony drinking game.
<VioletVanilla> Silencio in the bushes o3o
<AllisZero> http://miburl.com/QLAG3B
<AllisZero> That's just sad
<AllisZero> And awesome
<AllisZero> But
<AllisZero> Daw'd
<EdwardNewgate> You are now Rainbow Dash
<EdwardNewgate> What's the first thing you do?
<CogWeaver> good thing I don't drink
<VioletVanilla> I create a sonic rainboom right above your house! :3
<EdwardNewgate> <3
<EdwardNewgate> I'd join the wonderbolts
<EdwardNewgate> Then make Spitfire mai waifu
<RainBroDash> 10I'd
<SladeJT> How long did you stay up, Taggerung?
<RainBroDash> 10hmm
<VioletVanilla> RAINBRODAAAAASSSHHH!!!! <33
<RainBroDash> 10AAH
*VioletVanilla ponypounces RainBroDash
<RainBroDash> 10I mean HAI
<Dawn> Good plan, Cog.
<AllisZero> That comic was just
<Dawn> Stay above the influence.
<AllisZero> I don't now, a mix-match of emotions I wasn't prepared for
<AllisZero> Especially at work lul
<CogWeaver> oh
<RainBroDash> 10also brb reading that comic
<CogWeaver> right...yeah, that's what I meant...
<CogWeaver> >.>
<VioletVanilla> Otay~
<Taggerung> SladeJT: Too late, of course XD. Would not have if I had known the tree loppers were coming today
<CogWeaver> yeah, I'm a perfectly normal pony like the rest of you...that drinks water...and...other normal fluid...like things...for drinkning...
<FallSilently> Damn it, every day there's a new brilliant Octavia picture on Ponibooru.
<CogWeaver> it's because Octavia is best pony
<FallSilently> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/49617
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about artist:briskby Octavia cello
<CogWeaver> (don't tell Applejack I said that >.> )
<Taggerung> "<%FallSilently> Damn it, every day there's a new brilliant Pony picture on Ponibooru." Fixd
<MrPoniator> I shall make a horrible one to break the cycle!
<Dawn> Octavia got like two seconds of screen time.
<Dawn> How has she captured my heart?
<SladeJT> Somehow stayed up till 5 am, hit the bed, woke up a few hours later. *zombie mode*
<Balloons> !mail Applejack Cogweaver said he likes Octavia better
<DerpyBot> Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
<Balloons> :D
<CogWeaver> O_o
<CogWeaver> I...
<SladeJT> Damn I still think of Oktavia von whatever from Puella Madoka whenever I see that name.
<CogWeaver> You...
<CogWeaver> why...
<CogWeaver> *twitch*
<SladeJT> Because they're evil?
<RainBroDash> 10Yeah that comic was good:3
<CogWeaver> !moon Balloons
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Balloons!
<CogWeaver> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!!
<Balloons> :<
<EdwardNewgate> I quite enjoyed seeing Spitfire not in her uniform <3
<RainBroDash> 10and I guess if I were RD for a day, I'd just fly around screaming WOOOO XD
<RainBroDash> 10that too
<Balloons> !seen Applejack
<DerpyBot> Balloons: The last time I saw Applejack was Sun 14 Aug 2011 01:55:18 PM CEST
<CogWeaver> Octavia is a terrible pony, Applejack is best pony
<CogWeaver> there, happy?
<Dawn> Dang. That's messed up.
<AllisZero> Urgh
<AllisZero> Since I was 10 years of age
<Dawn> Stand by what you say, Cog! Don't waffle.
*CogWeaver snuggles with Applejack*
<AllisZero> Stories of people growing up, maturing, growing old, etc, have always struck a chord with me
<CogWeaver> I am standing by what I say, Applejack is best pony
<RainBroDash> 10Why's that? D:
<Balloons> Celestia will always be the best, in my opinion.
<CogWeaver> that's just because she's the ruler
<AllisZero> I guess since I was really young I understood that life is fleeting and that time doesn't wait for anyone
<CogWeaver> you're just trying to get on her good side, Balloons
<Taggerung> !link Pony_Joe
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/44628
<CogWeaver> expecting to get some reward from her from loving her so much
<Balloons> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/49169?search=celestia
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about Princess_Sealestia The_Legend_of_Zelda Wind_Waker celestia legend_of_zelda (and 2 more)
<Balloons> This made me laugh :D
*AllisZero emos up the whole place
<RainBroDash> 10nawww:3
<RainBroDash> 10but yeah, I get what you mean, but react in a completely different way
<FallSilently> Oh yeah, I still have to complete that game....
<FallSilently> I got to the final boss about two weeks ago and just forgot to beat him.
<RainBroDash> 10like, I'm not afraid of getting old and stuff, but I'm a strong believer in having a good life, not slaving away trying to give you a good chance at a better future
<RainBroDash> 10tl;dr I've never grown out of being a lazy kid
<Balloons> Windwaker? Yeah, i really liked that game.
*CogWeaver has never played any of the Zelda games all the way through, he's only played Ocarina of time part way through*
<RainBroDash> 10well, maybe not lazy, but not caring about the future at least
<RainBroDash> 10one of the by-products is laziness
<FallSilently> Never got bored of the sailing. People always seem to hate that but I loved it.
<SladeJT> Windwaker!
<SladeJT> All the Zelda games had their pros and cons but I really loved WW.
<AllisZero> That's exactly the opposite of me
<AllisZero> I guess it's, itself, a biproduct of being in a family of people with ruined lives and being thought of as the last beacon of hope
<SladeJT> Sailing bugged the Hell out of me but it was only the beginning of 'sailing adventures'...
<SladeJT> Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, Sonic Rush Adventures...
<RainBroDash> 10I'm the last beacon of hope
<SladeJT> Damn the boats!
<RainBroDash> 10for my family at least
<FallSilently> Aye....
<RainBroDash> 10everybody in my family is kinda in ruin at the moment financially, and trying desperately to pick themselves up
<EdwardNewgate> That's deep bro
<RainBroDash> 10my sister was hopeful, but she messed up her first year of uni, re-took it and then had a child and had to drop out
<RainBroDash> 10so it's all on me ;D
<AllisZero> So it's a question of how each of us takes that responsibility
<JackiePie> hey
<RainBroDash> 10But I guess that's why I'm insanely happy all the time at the moment, because I can't bear to try and take the strain, they all pile it on me and I still cruise through life
<RainBroDash> 10exactly
<Colgate> hihello
<RainBroDash> 10you're taking it sensibly and seriously, and every step of the way I'm -just- scraping through and trying to make it as enjoyable as I can on my way
<AllisZero> Too seriously maybe, and that's probably why stories like these depress the crap out of me
<AllisZero> Now that I remember I think the first time I realized this really was when I turned 10
<Lilfut> so i have a question about cave story
<RainBroDash> 10Well yeah, but on my end I've had a history of craziness and anger problems, because the stress really got to me at some points.
<Lilfut> if i get the booster 0.8, i have to reset to access sanctuary, correct?
<AllisZero> Suddenly it struck me, "Whoa, my age isn't in the single digits anymore"
<RainBroDash> 10ha really?
<AllisZero> Yep
<MrPoniator> Yep
<RainBroDash> 10I can't really remember anything that far back
<MrPoniator> You get a better booster if you manage to make a certain jump with the first one after a Balrog fight
<RainBroDash> 10The one thing I do remember is telling my best mate (when I turned 11) that I thought since he was turning 13 soon he might end up finding a new group of friends and leaving me in the dust a bit
<Lilfut> but does 2.0 get lost forever?
<RainBroDash> 10but those fears were silly and short-lived, he's still the best friend I've ever had :P
<AllisZero> I know how you feel, I think everyone's had that fear before
<AllisZero> But I'm that guy, the one who disappeared and left his friends behind
<MrPoniator> You get 2.0 if you don't take 0.8
<RainBroDash> 10I guess I did that, but not by choice
<Lilfut> GRRRRH
<AllisZero> I haven't had real-life friends for eight years now, due to a number of factors, including cultural and emotional
<AllisZero> Oh yeah neither did I
<RainBroDash> 10I was in boarding school until the age of 17, and I was forced to leave :P
<MrPoniator> It's a mistake I'm pretty sure everyone does on their first try if they don't read FAQs or something
<RainBroDash> 10well, I turned 17 in the holidays between moving from boarding to normal schoo
<RainBroDash> 10school*
<Dawn> It's a jump to the left. Then a jump to the right.
<RainBroDash> 10I've hardly spoken to any of them since
<AllisZero> Gotcha
<RainBroDash> 10oh wow just realised it's a week until my birthday
<RainBroDash> 10that went fast
*RainBroDash 10will be 19
<AllisZero> Yeah, few weeks till mine
<AllisZero> But I'll be 25 :p
<RainBroDash> 10same difference ;D
<Nostalgia> man i'm old
<AllisZero> welcome to the club
<Taggerung> Hey Sketchy_Sounds!
<RainBroDash> 10I'm not old, but I've not really done much with my life so far:
<RainBroDash> 10:P*
<AllisZero> Neither have I.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yo
<AllisZero> I have a degree, about 9 months work experience and that's it
<RainBroDash> 10At least you have a degree:D what is it in?
<AllisZero> Information engineering tech, kinda like computer science for dummies
<RainBroDash> 10rightyo
<RainBroDash> 10I'm taking Physics with a Foundation Year beforehand
<RainBroDash> 10hopefully I can do well enough in my first year to get onto a Masters course, who knows
<JackiePie> What's up?
<AllisZero> I dropped out of my master's course, it was stupid
<AllisZero> Teacher could hardly speak english, the class book was a book HE was writing WHILE doing the class
<RainBroDash> 10aahhhh
<RainBroDash> 10well that's just lame :/
<Dumori> sounds fun
<GGgala> wow, a textbook still being written
<AllisZero> He'd have new revisions of the book every week or so
<GGgala> that's a new one
<RainBroDash> 10ha
<GGgala> hope the tests weren't a moving target, too!
<AllisZero> I didn't need the credits either
<AllisZero> No tests, only research papers
<AllisZero> I might have to go back for a master's at some point, but right now I'm hardly motivated enough to get my certs
<Sketchy_Sounds> Not much
<Sketchy_Sounds> Irgh, my eyes are derping. I keep seeiog things blurrily
<Xiagu> Oh lol yep, I messed that up
<Xiagu> >suddenly Cave Story
<Xiagu> also it's SO HARD to make that jump, and if you fail you can't get back up and have to get the Booster 0.8 unless you reset
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Story: Near Death Experience (http://tinyurl.com/3oyvne3)
<SillyNilly|Sketch> For a second there I was worried. I thought somepony got hurt. Silly me.
<SillyNilly|Sketch> It's just a story.
<Xiagu> SillyNilly|Sketch, that was my reaction too
<Xiagu> Room's quiet. http://imgur.com/kwfcc
<Sketchy_Sounds> !seen Octavia
<DerpyBot> Sketchy_Sounds: The last time I saw Octavia was Thu 25 Aug 2011 09:37:44 AM CEST
<Sketchy_Sounds> lol Xiagu
<Dawn> Mods asleep. Post something other than ponies.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Post !ponies?
<ValtheJean> morning everyone
<Lukish> lol
<Ali1017> Mods aren't asleep, we're watching you right now.
<Dawn> Dang.
<SillyNilly|Sketch> >.>
<Dawn> Better put away my NPR links.
<AllisZero> Morning ValtheJean
<Ali1017> :p
<Purist> you can't keep me from not posting ponies!
<FallSilently> http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/Mods2.jpg
<Ali1017> I was only stating that we aren't asleep, not that you can't post something that isn't about or has ponies.
<ValtheJean> If I should happen to randomly go offline, it's because my apartment building is possibly shutting down the internet for the day
<Purist> mods never sleep
<ValtheJean> if that's the case, I'll make the trip to the library
<Dawn> I was joking about that one pic.
<ValtheJean> abusing free wifi ftw
<Dawn> Mods asleep, post ponies.
<Dermathil> ohai Val
<AllisZero> Haha
<Dawn> But in here, it would be the opposite.
<Dawn> Mods asleep, post something not pony related.
<FallSilently> Just replace all nouns with ponies and you're good to go.
<ValtheJean> howdy dermathil
<Dawn> Ponies just ran to Pony Pony.
<RainBroDash> 10haha, and yo valthejean
<ValtheJean> and how are you two today?
<Dawn> Doesn't work.
<ValtheJean> bah! Ohai RBD :P
<Dermathil> so Sathi didn't stream the L4D2 game
<RainBroDash> 10<3
<Dermathil> ?
*RainBroDash 10is great either way
<ValtheJean> there was a L4D2 game?
<Dermathil> yeah
<Taggerung> Painting Ponies with my Pony in paint tool Pony
<AllisZero> Man
<Dermathil> Killed the most infected
<FallSilently> Maybe if you also replace all verbs with ponies.
<ValtheJean> grats :P
<AllisZero> That rainbow dash comic really brought me down
<Dermathil> (500 kills)
<AllisZero> Like, completely
<ValtheJean> I'm tempted to say "what comic" but I don't want to be bummed out! I just woke up!
<RainBroDash> 10really not sure if it will live up to people's criticisms, but here's a clip of my favourite band covering a classic. Dunno if it might perk your mood up a bit AllisZero:)
<RainBroDash> 10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU2c5BdSg9M
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Incubus - Let&#39;s Go Crazy (Live at Late Night) [Hormoaning].avi" - "incubus performing lets go crazy live at late night."
<Dawn> Ok. Let's do that with this test sentance.
<AllisZero> I shall watch it in your honor
<Dawn> "I just ran to City Hall."
<ValtheJean> ooo00ooo a taste of RBD's music?
<ValtheJean> I shall listen to it naogh!
<Dawn> Pony just Pony to Pony Pony.
<Xiagu> ponies just ponied to ponies
<Xiagu> pony up
<AllisZero> >Retrospective
<FallSilently> "I" pony NOT a pony.
*AllisZero even more depressed now
<MrPoniator> God damnit
<RainBroDash> 10They just made a new album this summer :D
<MrPoniator> Am I secretely planing already a new ponified opening
<RainBroDash> 10I thought it was the end of incubus :<
<RainBroDash> 10BUT NO THEY LIVE
<RainBroDash> 10meep
<MrPoniator> I thought I'd use my last summer days better
<ValtheJean> lol
<Dawn> Buck it. Let's also turn all adjectives and adverbs into pony. Why not?
<FallSilently> Anyhow, I need to eat or I shall starve and you'd all be robbed of my magnificence.
<RainBroDash> 10wasn't sure whether to link the studio version or the live version, but that should do :P
<MrPoniator> Hmm
<FallSilently> So I must depart but only for the briefest of breaths.
<Taggerung> Anyhow, I need to pony or I shall pony and you'd all be ponied of my pony....how's that?
<AllisZero> That's a good song
<Dawn> You missed a few nouns and verbs.
<RainBroDash> 10hence my usage of the word classic :P
<AllisZero> Not much my style, but I have shit taste
<Purist> replace everything with pony
<MrPoniator> Pony, pony pony pon pony.
<ValtheJean> now now Allis
<RainBroDash> 10Not my style either really, but Incubus can really play anytihng
<Purist> there you go
<RainBroDash> 10anything*
<ValtheJean> music is too varied for anyone to have shit taste
<MrPoniator> It's like Pokemon talk
<ValtheJean> except for people who like mainstream rap
<RainBroDash> 10^
<Dawn> Anyhow, Pony need to pony or pony pony pony and pony'd all be ponied of pony pony.
<ValtheJean> they can go fuck themselves
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<AllisZero> Haha
<ValtheJean> :D
<AllisZero> My youngest brother
<Dawn> Wait, I missed "be".
<Dawn> I fail.
<AllisZero> Sometimes I'll go upstairs and I see a classic song

<AllisZero> That's been remixed, mutilated and covered with the about 50-word vocabulary of rap artists these days
<AllisZero> And I frown.
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> ung....THIS comic
<ValtheJean> I'm sorry, I don't buy it
<AllisZero> Yeah val, that comic.
<ValtheJean> it's playing too much on trying to be sappy
<ValtheJean> ironic that they used music from UP
<ValtheJean> come on, has anyone ever speculated that she might NOT be cut out for the wonderbolts?
<ValtheJean> and that maybe she has to...I don't know...WORK for it?
*ValtheJean rages
<Dermathil> Valthejean
<GGgala> >implying she isn't working for it
<Dermathil> I wouldn't be surprised if they actually pull that one in one of the episodes
<ValtheJean> she just sits there waiting for it to happen!
<ValtheJean> she doesn't even DO her regular job!
<GGgala> yes she does, she just procrastinates.
<ValtheJean> and she only likes showing off to people
<ValtheJean> let's not forget the whole "I am in no way a team player"
<Torrent> http://youtu.be/KoLCOc3lo6E?t=4m33s
<GGgala> well she shouldn't join /now/ obviously.
<RainBroDash> 10valthejean be crazy :D
<Dermathil> Valthejean, she'll have to learn. That's why character development exists.
<AllisZero> In the context of the comic, it doesn't matter how she gets in
<ValtheJean> well, that's why these things now tick me off
<GGgala> seriously, >implying the comic implied she didn't have to work her rump off
<Dermathil> She is flawed and will have to iron those flaws out if she really wants to get in one day.
<ValtheJean> yeah sorry, but based on the extremes I've seen with RD fans, I doubt it
<ValtheJean> to GGgala that is
<Dermathil> And I'm fairly sure that if she does join them, either she'll have to choose between her friends and the wonderbolts as a test of loyalty or it will mean the end of the show
<GGgala> ...huh?
<Dermathil> Due to the group breaking up
<GGgala> what do her fans have to do with anything
<ValtheJean> and sure, if they develop her into a CHARACTER as opposed to a Mary Sue then sure
<Dermathil> The fans don't make the canon, Valthejean.
<ValtheJean> I'd be all for it
<ValtheJean> not what I was saying
<ValtheJean> I meant fans like the creator of the comic
<Dermathil> You're complaining about the fanon RD, not the canon RD.
<Dermathil> the canon RD still has a lot to learn and a lot of flaws to fix through multiple seasons
<ValtheJean> pretty much
<ValtheJean> though my only problem with canon RD is that the writer's never actually have her learn anything
<GGgala> so... you're assuming you can read the comic maker's mind?
<Dermathil> Did you read Fallout: Equestria, ValtheJean?
<ValtheJean> which isn't a character issue more than a writing issue
<Dermathil> ValtheJean, she might have to in S2
<ValtheJean> and no, I don't read fanfics
<ValtheJean> period
<Dermathil> ah.
<ValtheJean> well I'd be fine with that
<ValtheJean> I certainly don't HATE RD
<ValtheJean> I just hate the massive amounts of love she gets for little to no reason
<ValtheJean> other than "she's drawn vewwy vewwy pwetty"
<Dermathil> She looks cool, that's all.
<Dermathil> She's laid back and doesn't afraid of anything.
<AllisZero> I'm not the biggest fan of RD but the comic has no mention whatsoever of anything other than her getting into the Wonderbolts
<Dermathil> That's how people see her.
<RainBroDash> 10aah, it's a beautiful day and I have the windows wide open, listening to incubus while fully clothed in bed. This is bliss right here
<ValtheJean> lol Rainbrodash I've gotta say you're the bomb, I've been trashing RD for like, a full 20 minutes and no kicks :P
<GGgala> prince-dari's probably asleep then.
<Lawdee> I'm back
<ValtheJean> I assumed as much
<Lawdee> did anyone miss me
<Lawdee> Probably not
<RainBroDash> 10that's your opinion bro, some people are just born wrong ;)
<Colgate> I DID
<GGgala> >dari's asleep. trash Rainbow Dash
<Lawdee> :D
<ValtheJean> ouch
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<ValtheJean> <34
<ValtheJean> <3*
<RainBroDash> 10<3 naawwh it's a fair point
<Lawdee> So, what's been going on
<Colgate> nothing
<ValtheJean> mfw the apartment shuts down my internet right during a Caramel discussion
<RainBroDash> 10she's a bit weak in terms of character development so far, but then again, I'm obsessed with colgate and apple fritter for no apparent reason, so I can't talk
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> well see, I view those kind of fanons a bit differently
<ValtheJean> liking a mane character should be based on what is presented in the show
<ValtheJean> as they actually have air time
<ValtheJean> love for a background character is just innocent fun really
<ValtheJean> filling in the blanks, so to speak
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<ValtheJean> plus, if your voice gets loud enough, it might catch on :P
*ValtheJean sacrifices a lamb to appease the FiM Gods
<Wrek> 5...
<Dermathil> I actually don't even know what pony I like the more.
<ValtheJean> one day Caramel...one day...
<Closet-Brony> I made A raeg comic today...
<Dermathil> I'm starting to wonder if Rarity is higher in my list than I actually think she is
<MrPoniator> :U
<AllisZero> I don't think character development is a big thing in this show, most episodes seem pretty isolated apart from the pilot ones
<Closet-Brony> http://themetalvinylproject.deviantart.com/#/d47s961
<Closet-Brony> ^comic^
<RainBroDash> 10I think if all of the BG ponies were given full character development, Vinyl Scratch would be my most favourite because of who she is, the DJ pony with the electric blue hair. My kind of filly
<AllisZero> Maybe it will be from one season to the next
<ValtheJean> isolated in terms of plot maybe
*AllisZero is late for the discussion, which has obviously moved on
<MrPoniator> lol
<ValtheJean> but the characters definitely progress
<ValtheJean> just look at Fluttershy
<Closet-Brony> you like?
<MrPoniator> What game is that?
<Closet-Brony> Dungeons of dredmor
<MrPoniator> Yeah, that was pretty funny
<ValtheJean> over the course of the season, she becomes more and more "assertive"
<Closet-Brony> HAlarious game
<ValtheJean> until it finally explodes when she goes a bit TOO far
<MrPoniator> Never played it myself
<Dermathil> She actually shows her darker side.
<Closet-Brony> It's on Steam for 5 dollars
<Dermathil> I'm really questionning Rarity's position in the bottom three.
<AllisZero> Yeah, that's a good point
<ValtheJean> there was a thread on ponychan about this I really liked
<MrPoniator> Unless it's for Mac, I'm afraid I can't get it
<Purist> wine~
<ValtheJean> basically, they came up with this medical term
<Dermathil> Also don't forget that RD has had the least screen time out of the mane six
<MrPoniator> Well, if it works on that
<SillyNilly|Sketch> I lol'd at that comic and I don't know why.
<ValtheJean> in which a pony faces a situation which conflicts with their cutie marks
<ValtheJean> I.E Fluttershy scaring animals, or Pinkie losing friends
<Dermathil> yeah
<Closet-Brony> SillyNilly|Sketch: Because you can? :3
<ValtheJean> which essentially causes them to have literaly breakdowns
<Dermathil> that's basically a Mental Breakdown
<ValtheJean> wow my grammar
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Yes!
<ValtheJean> but you get the point :P
<Dermathil> That's how I call these moments.
<Sharksky> Lawdee. :3c
<ValtheJean> t'was an interesting read
<Closet-Brony> Huzzah! People like the comic
<Dermathil> Such as when Twi in Swarm of the Century can't fix the problem
<ValtheJean> because it's a very captivating world building idea
<Closet-Brony> I already posted it to Bronies.memebase
<ValtheJean> when you live in a society where a single identity defines who you are and your place in this earth
<Closet-Brony> Like.... submission >_> thing
<ValtheJean> losing said identity can be traumatizing
<Lawdee> damn memebase
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Lawdee> I dun like it
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Now I must know what an Eave of Muffins is. What is it and what does it do?
<ValtheJean> at least, this is what I'll be presenting to my writing club when I introduce the show to them :P
<Dermathil> hahaha
<Closet-Brony> Eave of Muffins was the location name I was in
<Sharksky> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaves
<Dermathil> Where is Rarity in your mane 6 ladder, Val?
<Closet-Brony> Each room in the dungeon has a different name
<ValtheJean> hmmm
<Dermathil> She did have a LOT of character development
<ValtheJean> to be fair, I try not to have these sort of ladders, as I enjoy all of the characters (I view them all as an essential combination)
<ValtheJean> with that being said
<Lawdee> Today wasn't that busy
<ValtheJean> if I had to make a lit
<ValtheJean> list*
<ValtheJean> Rarity would probably be the #1
<Lawdee> I'm actually here without having to do something else :D
<ValtheJean> mostly because I think she's had the most development as far as a character goes
<ValtheJean> plus the situations she faces are entertaining to me
<Closet-Brony> Is....is that a good thing? >_>
<Dermathil> Dog and Pony show comes to mind..
<ValtheJean> indeed
<ValtheJean> I especially like the element of her character relating to boys
<Lawdee> Yes it is?
<ValtheJean> because, I don't see her as some manipulative witch
<Lawdee> Yesterday I was here while I was probably supposed to do something else
<Closet-Brony> Okay... just checking
<Dermathil> She's generous.
<ValtheJean> she was simply raised under the assumption that men and women act in certain ways
<ValtheJean> and has grown accustomed to being treated like a lady
<RobotPinkie> ohai bronies
<Dermathil> Valthejean, did you play the fallout games? I don't remember if you already answered that question before
<ValtheJean> and in addition, because she receives so much attention, she's a bit oblivious to Spike's feelings
<ValtheJean> howdy Robotpinkie
<ValtheJean> I played one of them a while ago
<ValtheJean> can't remember which one
*RainBroDash 10waves at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0E7rWt_t0w
<Dermathil> alright.
<RainBroDash> 10lol
<RainBroDash> 10I failed to copypaste robotpinkie's name
<ValtheJean> lol
<Dermathil> Just sayin', Fallout: Equestria doesn't have the mane 6 as the mane characters
<RainBroDash> 10so apparently you can have another incubus song?
<ValtheJean> lol
<RobotPinkie> Just type "Robo" and hit tab :P
<ValtheJean> well even still Dermathil, I wont read it
<RobotPinkie> and hey RainBroDash
<ValtheJean> I can't bear to read fanfics
<RainBroDash> 10yo:3
<B-Man> Ponies have influenced my decision making.
<RainBroDash> 10why? :P
<ValtheJean> it may be elitist of me, but I'll be damned before I subject myself to such nonsense
<RainBroDash> 10D:
<B-Man> Causing me to get a muffin instead of a danish at a gas stop
<Dermathil> >yfw I still want to cry rivers when I think of the latest chapter, 12 hours after reading it
*RainBroDash 10hides in a corner
<B-Man> Chocolate chip
<RobotPinkie> Well, some of that nonsense is pretty good...
<ValtheJean> lol, I'm sorry Rainbrodash
<ValtheJean> I just really doubt that Robotpinkie
<Dermathil> If you were to ever read a single fic, I'd recommend FO:E.
<RobotPinkie> I mean there's a lot of crap, obviously...
<RainBroDash> 10hehe, its fine dude, I thought the same not too long ago
<Taggerung> Petrol station muffins...getting close to baked bads thar sir!
<ValtheJean> honestly I wouldn't like FO:E dermathil
<Dermathil> Just because of the fact that it is over 440 000 words long and is very well written.
*RainBroDash 10enjoys a lot of the cheesy shipfics, because he's a crazy motherfucker
<Dawn> I hate muffins.
<ValtheJean> I don't like the idea of crossing ponies into a dark apocalyptic world
<B-Man> Not that bad, actually.
<Dawn> inb4 !moon
<Dawn> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Dawn!
<B-Man> Muffins are cupcakes without frosting.
<Dermathil> I understand that, Val.
<ValtheJean> I have plenty of other sources for my depression needs
<RobotPinkie> I'm not a fan of shipping, but to each his/her own
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<ValtheJean> but ponies are my stimulant of happiness :P
<ValtheJean> heh, well I can agree with the first part Robotpinkie :P
<RobotPinkie> I'm a drug called ponies
<Dermathil> Want anything stronger than anything you already got for depressive thoughts, read it.
<RainBroDash> 10RainBroDash is RainBroDash's source of happiness
<Dawn> There. Happy?
<Closet-Brony> Chocalate muffins
<Dermathil> It is just so darn powerful.
<RobotPinkie> If you try it once you will POMF
<ValtheJean> now that I think about it, I'd prefer reading a fanfic (not clopfic) over seeing shipping
*Dermathil is feeling his eyes watering again.
<ValtheJean> heh, there are very few things in this world that can make me shed a tear
<ValtheJean> perhaps it's because I traded my soul to the devil centuries ago
<Dermathil> Oh, then you'll cry rivers.
<RainBroDash> 10I couldn't live if I didn't have me. Me and I, we're like best buddies to the end
<ValtheJean> or maybe I was always a cold heartless bastard :P
<ValtheJean> lol
<RobotPinkie> I was banging seven gram ponies, that's how I roll
<ValtheJean> inb4 Rainbrodash is shipped with himself
<RainBroDash> 10rofl
<RobotPinkie> oh wait that came out wrong...
<B-Man> How was your trip?
<Dermathil> Even cold heartless bastards cry when reading FO:E. It has a few VERY cheap shots.
<RainBroDash> 10also ValtheJean I couldn't be shipped with me, I love me too much
<ValtheJean> lol
<Dawn> It wasn't bad.
<Dermathil> (cheap shots being cheap as in they hurt as hell inside reading them, not that they're actually cheaply written)
*RainBroDash 10has become horribly narcissistic over the last few months, it's great.
<RobotPinkie> I dunno
<ValtheJean> eh, again I doubt that it'd move me derma
<B-Man> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around B-Man in a tight embrace
<Dermathil> Don't knock it 'til you try it.
<RobotPinkie> I love parts of myself :P
<firelight> good morning everypony!! =)
<RobotPinkie> moderation in all things.
<Dermathil> Because I though I wouldn't cry either.
<RobotPinkie> ...except ponies, ponies are the exception to that
<Nickel_Scream> morning!
<Parchment_Scroll> Morning, Firelight.
<Satheria> 7omg omg omg
<Dermathil> Until I reached a specific chapter that pulled at a few sensible strings.
*Parchment_Scroll is up at completely the wrong time of day. :(
<RobotPinkie> ohai Satheria
<RainBroDash> 10I stumbled home drunk to my mother's house one time a couple weeks ago, and my mum wondered what the noise was. She found me staring in a mirror giggling wildly and going 'oh my god man. Never change, you fucking ROCK' and giggling more
<ValtheJean> A wild sathi appeared!
<RainBroDash> 10I was literally pointing at my reflection going I LOVE YOU BRO
<RobotPinkie> Haha
*ValtheJean throws masterball
<B-Man> It's nearly noon.
<B-Man> My time.
<ValtheJean> and lol RBD
<Closet-Brony> It's always the wrong time of DAY
<Parchment_Scroll> Same here. But I usually work nights.
*RainBroDash 10is insane, but the best kind of insane
<Satheria> 7Ohai :P
<Parchment_Scroll> The past couple of days have made my sleep schedule all wonky.
<RobotPinkie> I do that too whenever I look into my pants, RainBroDash
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<RainBroDash> 10oh lawdy~
<ValtheJean> what he doesn't mention is all the ladies cower in horror :P
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<Dermathil> Dashite?
<Dawn> Out of curiosity, can anyone see a PMV set to this song? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRLdhFVzqt4
<RobotPinkie> lolol not too far from the truth, ValtheJean :P
<RainBroDash> 10I've been like that looking in the mirror recently, even though i've got more weight to lose, I'm starting to look/feel relatively trim
<Dermathil> Anybody here knows the game Shattered Horizons?
<ValtheJean> eenope
<RainBroDash> 10^
<ShadTheCrazed> My profile on my mom's laptop is now about 20% cooler.
<Dermathil> darn.
<ShadTheCrazed> Apple Jack theme for Google Chrome. :D
<RobotPinkie> I need to work out more...
<ValtheJean> man...I'm not sure what to do...should I just go to the library now or wait and see if it wont happen until later?
<RobotPinkie> I know what it is, Dermathil
<Dermathil> You're basically astronauts shooting eachother in Zero-G
<firelight> I just saw this video on youtube and well my sister is still crying and my tears came to me XD
<Dermathil> nice, RP.
<firelight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gtwq6RM9Og&feature=feedf
<RobotPinkie> ...because I think you linked me to it a couple of weeks back :P
<Dermathil> aaah
<B-Man> I've got a Twilight Persona for Firefox. :P
<RobotPinkie> it's the one where you got an awesome kill ratio?
<Closet-Brony> I remember this comic....
<Closet-Brony> WAIT! It'S DIFFERENT!
<Closet-Brony> *sits for a minute*
<Dermathil> total KDR for the entire game account is 1.5
<Dermathil> but I usually do 40+ kills per game now
<Dermathil> usually with a KDR of 10+
<ShadTheCrazed> All I could find for Google Chrome as an Apple Jack theme.
<RobotPinkie> That's pretty good
<ShadTheCrazed> So I used it.
<Dermathil> Just that shitty early games balances it out
<ShadTheCrazed> Freakin' beautiful.
<Dermathil> http://stats.shatteredhorizon.com/stats/playerStatistics.action?playerId=78053
<Dermathil> dat be stats
<Crainy> my little ponies!
<RainBroDash> 10RobotPinkie If you believe you need to work out more, then do it :P I can't really say much, since when I started losing weight I was in this wonderful equilibrium between crippling self-loathing and inexplicably strong self-loving. Weight loss is a strange thing
<firelight> dawn that is the sound track of fallout equestria
<RainBroDash> 10You kinda have to be in the right mindset, but you can't control it
<Dawn> Sheoot.
<Crainy> hi fellow bronies
<RainBroDash> 10I just -happened- to have the perfect balance to start losing shedloads of weight XD
<Dermathil> btw. I'm pretty sure you'd like the game, Val.
<Crainy> fellow bronies, listen up!
<Crainy> i need your aid again
<RobotPinkie> Yeah
<ValtheJean> oh?
<RobotPinkie> I walk a lot more than I used to
<Closet-Brony> huhwha?
<Crainy> where can i find a good download link for all the MLP Season 1 Episodes in 1080p?
<Dermathil> The problem being there are almost nobody playing it anymore
<Dermathil> though
<Dawn> I assume you want them for free.
<Dawn> So buying them off itunes is a no-go.
<Crainy> well
<Dermathil> Game was great and very daring
<Crainy> ofc
<firelight> oh... thats not easy
<RobotPinkie> Like I got temporary problems with my knees, and that's when I decided I couldn't be such a lazy bastard :P
<Dermathil> but wasn't popular
<Crainy> WAIT
<Crainy> they are on I-Tunes?
<Dawn> They are.
<ValtheJean> well I might look it up at one point
<Crainy> how much?
<Closet-Brony> I dunno about 1080p... but i know a place where they are <_<
<Dawn> $2 an episode.
<Dermathil> due to the fact that it is in space and you gotta check your 360 degrees on all three axis
<Crainy> mmmhh
<Lilfut> youtube
<Lilfut> derpyhooves.com has downloads, mostly 1080p
<Lilfut> but not all
<Crainy> cool
<Crainy> thanks
<Crainy> you know
<ValtheJean> so I had a *fun* interaction with my new roommate
<Crainy> im loading them from YT right now
<Parchment_Scroll> Kewl, need more eps for PMV stuff.
<Crainy> but they sometimes have that stupid hub logo and so on
<RobotPinkie> It's much harder to train when you've got studies though, RainBroDash
<Crainy> i dont like that
<RainBroDash> 10RobotPinkie, I just disliked all of the discomfort, whether it came from social anxiety (I'm a really anxious person), or genuine physical discomfort like chafing. I hated being overweight
<Lilfut> missing 4-12 except 8 in 1080p
<Crainy> seeing how i want them for a special kind of MLP video
<ValtheJean> so I'm moving in, and as I'm unpacking and whatnot he arrives.
<Lilfut> crop out the bottom
<ValtheJean> we start chatting it up, all that jazz
<Lilfut> messy, but it works
<Crainy> naah
<ValtheJean> and at one point I mention I'm a rather huge internet nerd
<Crainy> thats cheap
<RainBroDash> 10and robotpinkie I started losing weight while I was studying my last few months of A-Levels, to get into Uni. Not the hardest studies, but I found it bloody hard
<Colgate> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6577296/My_little_pony__Friendship_is_magic_season_1_1080p
<ValtheJean> of which he replies that he's all tolerant and "each their own" kind of person
<ValtheJean> so there, I'm going "cool beans"
<Colgate> there, all episodes in 1080p :P
<Dermathil> alright, leaving now.
<ValtheJean> and proceed to hang the MLP Comic-Con poster
<RainBroDash> 10cya dermathil
<Lilfut> i stopped using torrents when we got a dmca notice for spore
<RobotPinkie> Well, yeah RainBroDash, but I mean I might have to settle for just the walks for now.
<Dermathil> Cyall when I'm back from my 3 hours class!
<ValtheJean> see ya later dermathil
<Crainy> i love you colgate
<RobotPinkie> later Dermathil
<ValtheJean> he goes a bit silent for a while...and then goes back to work
<Lilfut> i think it was because of seeding
<Colgate> lilfut, get a program called ipblock
<Closet-Brony> YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE
<ValtheJean> awkward, but that isn't even the best part
<RainBroDash> 10well robotpinkie I still don't have much muscle mass, so at the moment all my exercise is fine from just doing pressups and situps
<Lilfut> i dont wanna risk it dude
<ValtheJean> the next morning, he walks up to me
<Nickel_Scream> Colgate: sorry I don't love you. You're nice, but I'm an aquafresh man.
<ValtheJean> and says:
<ValtheJean> "I'm not trying to imply anything, but last night I had a dream that you were a cross-dresser and tried to seduce me"
*RainBroDash 10is waiting with bated breath
<Dawn> I'll stick to Jack.
<RainBroDash> 10LOL
<Lilfut> my dad is going to murder my face if we get dmca'd again
<Dermathil> LAWL
<RainBroDash> 10ahaahahaha
<Dermathil> alright, leaving.
<ValtheJean> >mfw: >.<
<Dawn> Then pirate off someone elses network.
<Crainy> for Spore: the game?
<RainBroDash> 10xD N'awww ValtheJean that's hilarious
<Nickel_Scream> how areyou getting DMCAd?
<RobotPinkie> Oh wow ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> his subconscious hates me >.<
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Lilfut> i torrented spore
<Lilfut> and ea sent charter a dmca
<Crainy> well
<Crainy> thats an obvious one
<Lilfut> and charter called us about it
<RobotPinkie> Well as long as it's not too conscious :P
<Crainy> Spore was overprotected by EA
<ValtheJean> lol
<Colgate> without using any sort of protection I'm assuming
<Colgate> thus, you were a low hanging fruit
<ValtheJean> to be fair, I probably broke out the posters a little TOO soon
<Lilfut> i still dont wanna fuck with it
<Dermathil> yeah you prolly did
<R2-D2> mmyeaah maybe
<ValtheJean> life was much simpler as a closet brony :P
<RobotPinkie> I look forward to the time when you tell me about his brony conversion story :P
<R2-D2> also wrong tab>.>
<RainBroDash> 10^me
<ValtheJean> lol, I dunno about that
<Colgate> /shrug, your loss
<AllisZero> Lol
<Crainy> Lilfut
<ValtheJean> I'm not too big on the whole "converting" people thing
<Lilfut> i dont pirate, the only reason i torrented spore was because i lost my cd key
<RainBroDash> 10I'm hiding everything pony
<Crainy> how much did you have to pay?
<Lilfut> i didnt
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I have a Pinkie Pie on my desk during Physics class.
<Crainy> but?
<Lilfut> it was a warning
<RobotPinkie> Only the immigrant kids talk to me, olololololol
<ValtheJean> well, this is a rather extreme religious university
<Crainy> mhm
<AllisZero> Bigots, bigots everywhere, RobotPinkie
*RainBroDash 10refuses to comment on the word religious
<ValtheJean> so heh...maybe if they start getting on my nerves about jebus I'll start converting them :P
<RainBroDash> 10>.>
<MrPoniator> I mostly pirate games that are unavaible
<Nickel_Scream> Why would you torrent something if you lost your key?
<MrPoniator> At shops or otherwise
<Nickel_Scream> You could just get a new key without downloading the game.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, ouch, that does change things a bit, ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> lol, tis a good stance Rainbrodash :P
<Torrent> leave me alone D;
<Lilfut> i could, but my disc was also scratched
<RainBroDash> 10I'm not embracing the pony at all during University. As strange as it is, I'll have a hard enough time making a great new circle of friends without going HAI GUISE PONY TIEM?
<Nickel_Scream> aaaah
<Lilfut> i hadnt played spore for 2 or 3 years
<RobotPinkie> I'll comment on religions for you, RainBroDash !
<RainBroDash> 10yeaah no
<RainBroDash> 10:p
<RobotPinkie> They're all equally valid!
<RainBroDash> 10I refuse to discuss it
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<ValtheJean> lol
<firelight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InGTiCDBPZI&feature=related ... o-o
<ValtheJean> my desire to wear pony shirts overpowered my "no, don't tell people you gigantic moron"
<RobotPinkie> Nah but seriously, I get along with pretty much everypony.
<AllisZero> I say we let people believe in whatever they want, so long as they don't push their beliefs onto the rest of us
<AllisZero> IN other news
<MrPoniator> lol at the best comment
<AllisZero> dat comic man, dat comic
<RainBroDash> 10meh :O
<RobotPinkie> also hi AllisZero, before I forget :P
<RainBroDash> 10meh:P*
<RobotPinkie> what comic?
<ValtheJean> the comic has been mentioned!
*ValtheJean rages
*RobotPinkie goes to EqD
<AllisZero> Hi RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> ...I still don't get what comic... :P
<RobotPinkie> Sea ponies?
<ValtheJean> meh, it's the comic about RD being a wonderbolt
<Sathi> 7suddenly
<Sathi> 7a wild stream appeared
<RobotPinkie> ahhhh
<Sathi> 7get it while it's hot
<ValtheJean> QUICK!
<RobotPinkie> Nice!
*ValtheJean throws masterball
*RobotPinkie pounces Sathi's stream
<AllisZero> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/comic-memories.html
<AllisZero> That, RP
<ValtheJean> hmmm, it says offline to me
<ValtheJean> nm
<RainBroDash> 10whatcha streamin?
<RobotPinkie> Oh... that's kinda old, also why are people raging over it? :P
<AllisZero> I just saw it, that's why
<AllisZero> And then ValtheJean went full horseapples
<ValtheJean> I said it before, but just to make sure I don't look like an ass, if I suddenly disconnect it's because my apartment complex is doing maintenance on our internet connection
<RobotPinkie> lolol oh okay
<ValtheJean> oh which I will then run my ass to the Library >.<
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<ValtheJean> and yeah, what AllisZero said :P
<RobotPinkie> lol may I ask why?
<ValtheJean> oh dear
<RobotPinkie> I mean I don't mean to stir up crap or something
<ValtheJean> nah it's fine
<Colgate> ohey, I have XP open, wonder how long it has been like that -.-
<ValtheJean> the only thing that legitimately makes me angry is shipping
<RainBroDash> 10:<
<ValtheJean> but yeah as far as the comic goes
*RainBroDash 10hides in the corner again
<ValtheJean> basically, it just brings to mind a lot of the senseless love for RD when she has so little character development
<RobotPinkie> I thought it was cute, though way too sappy or something
*ValtheJean ends rant
<RobotPinkie> I can understand that, ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> RINNNNNBARRRRRRDOSSSSSHHHH....the sidekick of DURRRRRRRGARRRRRRR
<RobotPinkie> Kinda wish they'd do more with Dash than just "I love to win at everything!"
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> this is going to get confusing fast
<AllisZero> Makes her sound like a very simple character
<AllisZero> Well, actually.. she is a very simple character
<ValtheJean> pretty much
<RobotPinkie> I think that we'll get to know more about everypony's personality in S2
<AllisZero> RD is the epitome of the talented fictional character for whom things come easily
<ValtheJean> I would hope so
<ValtheJean> *cough* Mary Sue *cough*
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<RobotPinkie> so what are we watching, even?
<ValtheJean> Kennen and Kel
*RinBarDosh 10doesn't care for your mere sub-standard ponies
<AllisZero> Truth be told I like all of them
<RinBarDosh> 10We're watching Kenan and Kel?!
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I think all the ponies are pretty much awesome
<RobotPinkie> though I do have preference for some
<ValtheJean> O_o
<RinBarDosh> 10aslfkjnag my stream isn't going to work ;___;
<Crainy> so guys
<Crainy> i have a question
<Colgate> I have answers
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: MLP Online Botique Demo (http://tinyurl.com/3rr4p49)
<RobotPinkie> wtf MLP Online demo?
<ValtheJean> MUFFIN?
<Crainy> great
<ValtheJean> MUFFIN
<Crainy> but actually
<Crainy> the question is stupid

<Nickel_Scream> http://www.buzzom.com/2011/03/social-networking-sites-attracts-more-users-than-porn-sites/
<Crainy> thats what i was going for
<Nickel_Scream> there you go.
<Colgate> Sethisto played UO? win
<Crainy> social networking sites
<Crainy> NOT facebook
<RobotPinkie> PRISON RIOT!
<CHAENNE> hey, are we all wathcing the same thing?
<Nickel_Scream> alright
*Kitten sighs
<Nickel_Scream> but still
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<Aristeo> Yes Kitten?
*Aristeo hugs Kitten
<RainBroDash> 10if it's in that box on the left, then yeah :P
<Nickel_Scream> facebook is a social networking site, and its somewhat synonymous with social networking
<Colgate> also, that is going by hits, and not bandwidth
<RobotPinkie> oh wow there are new shirts :O
<Rinbardosh> 0ohai Red guy
<Nickel_Scream> yeah I got that point confused.
<CHAENNE> because i'm quite confused as to why the hell i'm looking at a demon prisonguard
<Nickel_Scream> But still, hits are worth more than bandwidth
<RobotPinkie> http://www.welovefine.com/img/p/663-1572-large.jpg
<Sathi> its a old show
<ValtheJean> lol
<Crainy> also
<Nickel_Scream> because each hit is a person, versus bandwidth were one pornhound could take up a lot more of the number
<Crainy> soon
<Crainy> MLP will be Number 1
<Colgate> hit != person
<RobotPinkie> That one's pretty nice...
<MrPoniator> I've never used facebook or similiar sites, heh
<RainBroDash> 10Cow & Chicken :D
<Crainy> me neither
<Crainy> but i have used Ponies
<Nickel_Scream> then you two are luddites.
<Nuclear> Me neither also...
<Nuclear> ?
<CHAENNE> "pork butts"?
<RainBroDash> 10oh wow this brings back ridiculous memories
<Nuclear> What!?
<Nickel_Scream> Come into the modern effing world and use a social networking site.
<Crainy> NUCLEAR LAUNCH DETECTED
<CHAENNE> this is strange
<Colgate> I don't like social media sites
<RainBroDash> 10it is.
<Nuclear> PFFFFT
<Nickel_Scream> They're pretty cool, and useful for organizing things and keep in contact.
<Crainy> you know whats also pretty cool?
<Colgate> I only use them because some people I know can only be contacted through them because they never check their email asdf
<Nuclear> Facebook is nothing but a drama site.....
<Nickel_Scream> colgate: man, why dont you drop that BS and get to whitening teeth?
<Crainy> PONEIS
<Nickel_Scream> <3
<Crainy> fuck
<MrPoniator> Nickel, tell me a reason to do so, when all my friends and buddies have either IRC, Skype or MSN, and I'm in contact with them, in real time, every day?
<Crainy> i mean PONIES
<B-Man> So what do you think the odds are that EqD will hit 40 million before Sept 17th?
<B-Man> >_>
<B-Man> :P
<RobotPinkie> lol I love this show, but they still show it on CN here sometimes.
<Crainy> its possible
<Nickel_Scream> mr: because I doubt literally every one of your friends doesnt have a facebook.
<Crainy> i guess
<Rinbardosh> 0Now THIS is WAY better than Rocko's modern life
<RobotPinkie> and my personal favorite CN show, Courage the Cowardly Dog
<Crainy> uhm
<Parchment_Scroll> It'll hover at 39,999,999 until the episode airs.
<Taggerung> Nuclear: This
<RainBroDash> 10anyway gonna go potter about the house, maybe grab some munch
<Crainy> alot of my friends dont have facebook
<ValtheJean> ah, Courage was a good show

<RainBroDash> 10be back in a little bit
<ValtheJean> see ya later Rainbro :P
<Sathi> i'll look for courage

*Gilda flicks her fringe feathers.

<RainDancer> Due to the prevalence of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic in the United States f America and beyond, a team of sociologists are taking a surgery as to why country that the colloquial term "brony" can apply to, and why.
<Colgate> a surgery?
<RobotPinkie> oh wow
<RainDancer> (Pardon my Anglic, ist y first language.)
<Gilda> Huh? Why country?
<Parchment_Scroll> http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer/equestriadaily.html
<Barry> Hi
<Parchment_Scroll> Has breakdown by what countries those of us who've given Owlowysius stats claim, gender, age, etc.
<Colgate> Parchment_Scroll: ?
<RobotPinkie> hey Barry
<ValtheJean> howdy barry
<Rinbardosh> ohai
<Colgate> well, I wouldn't trust those stats
<Parchment_Scroll> It's a start.
<MrPoniator> Could you eloborate the question, Rain?
<Colgate> considering most people put down Equestria for their country :P
<Gilda> You mean a "study," not a "surgury?"
<Parchment_Scroll> Are you saying they're.... LYING?
<Lawdee> What what WHAT
<Lawdee> why am I still not in front of lunasta
<Lawdee> ffffff
<Lawdee> Dammit
<RainDancer> ...Probably. XD
<Colgate> you don't spam enough

<Parchment_Scroll> RainDancer wants to know what country bronies are from.
<RobotPinkie> so awesome
<Lawdee> I really overuse "awesome" don't I
<Lawdee> But the word awesome is just so awesome
<RainDancer> Me? Germany. Breslau.
<RobotPinkie> I love how he constantly smells his finger...
<Parchment_Scroll> I keep trying to get on the "language of their own" list. :P
<ShadTheCrazed> I don't care what anyone says, Gummy the Krookorok, Guile the Machamp, Luna the Absol, GLaDOS the Porygon2, and co will tear off all of Tennessee.
<ShadTheCrazed> >:D
<MrPoniator> Too bad I can't talk in german anymore
<Nuclear> I always try to say something different too bad my vocabulary is quite limited :V
<ShadTheCrazed> *up
<MrPoniator> I used to be somewhat good with it
<Sathi> 7ValtheJean: PM
<Colgate> I'm not sure how Owloysius got the age data
<CHAENNE> sorry my computer overheated
<Lawdee> I'm good with the german accent
<Nuclear> *GULP*
<Nuclear> Age huh.....
<Lawdee> just not the language.
<Lawdee> Wait, age?
<RobotPinkie> welcome back, CHAENNE
<Parchment_Scroll> @Colgate: You can give him your birthdate.
<Parchment_Scroll> I'm the oldest one in his DB, apparently.
<Colgate> yeah, there's an age section
*Parchment_Scroll is a fogey.
<Nuclear> Phew!
<JackiePie> fogey?
<JackiePie> as in old?
<RainDancer> H'okay. So, if folk could just type what country they're in? I'll log this section of chat for review.
<CHAENNE> is this the same show?
<Larscis> I glanced at "fogey" and saw "Fogerty." Not sure why.
<Parchment_Scroll> Republic of Texas. :P Technically a country. Marginally. Alternatively, the United States of America.
<Colgate> RainDancer: /who #EquestriaDaily
<Lawdee> I'm in the Nethelands
<Lawdee> Netherlands*
<MrPoniator> Lol wat
<Colgate> then just read off the domains, usually lines up with country
<MrPoniator> Saunaland on the country list
<RainDancer> Colgate: Zhat data is a tad circumspect
<MrPoniator> Finland has a nickname now!
<Lawdee> also, <Colgate> RainDancer: /who #EquestriaDaily
<Lawdee> Yay for needless pinging
<Colgate> whenever I get pinged, my system speaker beeps
<Colgate> and I have an awesome system speaker
<RobotPinkie> It's "I Am Weasel", and it's part of "Cow & Chicken"... at least at this point, it was later made into its own stand-alone show
<Nickel_Scream> whenever I get pinged I pong.
<Parchment_Scroll> Mine makes the Windows "Ding" sound.
<Sathi> 7Alright guys semi afk.. will try to switch shows as they end

<Rinbardosh> >.<
<Nickel_Scream> uuuhg bleah
<Nickel_Scream> *bleach
<RobotPinkie> second best cartoon of all time! ...or almost, anyway
<AllisZero> I liked it for what it is but it's the feelings it brought to the surface that kinda give me the chills
<Nickel_Scream> Gilda: so you're either a guy trying to pretend girlitude or a girl hiding from randy nerds.
<Colgate> well, you were either from ireland, or connecting through a proxy in ireland, /shrug
<Parchment_Scroll> Won't work. You're Irish, which translates to "awesome" in my book. :P
<RobotPinkie> I can see why
<Parchment_Scroll> @firelight: Good start. I think you can work a bit more at making it feel more like the Bleach OP, but that's mee.
<Gilda> Is there really a third option there, Nickel?
<AllisZero> Reason being I've always been very conscious about the passage of time
<Parchment_Scroll> Er, "me."
<rachel> i'm half irish, does that count for anything?
<CHAENNE> just as a reminder, tomorrow(friday) at 7:00?
<RobotPinkie> Then don't play "Passage" :P
<Nickel_Scream> Gilda: Yes.
<RainDancer> Gilda: Erin go bragh! ^_^
<AllisZero> Passage?
<Nickel_Scream> Gilda: Your a transexual whose experience a form of freedom in a place where people dont judge by apperarnce but by thoughts.
*Colgate starts chewing a minty stick of gum.
<Nickel_Scream> Colgate: you're a terrible representitive, gum is bad for teeth.
<Parchment_Scroll> Erin abu!
*Gilda stares
<RobotPinkie> EST, CHAENNE, I'm pretty sure
<CHAENNE> 7 eastern is like 9 pacific, right?
<Nickel_Scream> that is the 3rd option.
<Colgate> but it is minty!
<Gilda> I'm also a griffon in a room full of crazs ponies.
<AllisZero> nope
<RobotPinkie> dunno exactly
<AllisZero> 7 eastern is 4 pacific I believe
<Gilda> crazy*
<Parchment_Scroll> Hey, I resent that remark!

<RobotPinkie> man, power rangers was awesome... I'd forgotten so much about it
<RainBroDash> oh, well fair :D

<B-Man> If there was a portal to Equestria, I'd immediately try to hang with Twilight first.
<Blums> Lol colgate
<RobotPinkie> Holy fuck, that was an awesome reverse shot right there
<Sathi> 7dat throw
<Parchment_Scroll> Why is Pinkie Pie kicking the crap out of that chimney?
*HaysforPonies is now hungry for bacon.
<Blums> it says fourth wall on it
<RainDancer> I'd try to get a job as Royal Hoof-Shiner. *sagenod*
<Gilda> It's a fourth wall, dude
<RobotPinkie> I mean with the off-balance stumble and everything, that is SERIOUSLY brilliant
<Parchment_Scroll> Ah.
<Parchment_Scroll> Oh, it's frickin' labeled.
<Blums> technically applejack should be invisible in that picture
<Parchment_Scroll> *facehoof*
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<RainBroDash> 10i swear they used the off-balance stumble so much

<RobotPinkie> in shots filmed in reverse? :O
<BillyColt> ergh, I just wish I could make this better.
<BillyColt> Also it seems /co/ doesn't like fanfic discussion
<RobotPinkie> It really adds a lot believability to the shot, like Bruce Campbell's reverse acting in Army of Darkness.
<Nickel_Scream> why is AJ made of purple gravity?
<Gilda> Dark matter.
<Blums> she should be made of dark matter, but that tends to be invisible
<Nickel_Scream> also why is rarity a marshmellow? and why does twi have baconhair?
<RobotPinkie> lol >believability
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<RobotPinkie> I just realized I said that about something in Power Rangers... FFFFFFFUUUUU
<HaysforPonies> They identify with them the most.
<Blums> alot of people thing rarity looks like a marshmellow and... idk about wi

<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/21195
<RainBroDash> 10:D:D
<HaysforPonies> Rarity is seen as a marshmellow by her white legs and their detail
<Octavia> 14Jeez, this show is cheesy as all hell, but I used to love it when I was little.
<MrPoniator> I wonder how many tries it takes till it links either one of my gifs on ponychan
<HaysforPonies> At one point, Twilight's hair resembles purple bacon. The internet ran with it.
<Plorf> &
<Blums> oh XD
<RobotPinkie> It's still fun... cheesy but fun.
<RaZor> I never watched it, living in Sweden and all that shit
<Octavia> 14Delicious cheesy fun.
<RobotPinkie> oh you're Swedish too, lol
<GGgala> >never escalate a battle unless Rita force you;
<GGgala> well that explains it.
<RainBroDash> 10hai RaZor :P
<HaysforPonies> Rainbow Dash has an awesome house. An Olympus themed cloud house in the sky that leaks rainbows.
<RobotPinkie> It actually aired on TV here, RaZor :P
<RobotPinkie> that robot is such a racist stereotype....
<Nuclear> I agree
<Nuclear> Biggie Smalls agrees as well!
<Gilda> Pfft.
<RobotPinkie> Yay, more Power Rangers!
<Nickel_Scream> if you could get a smooch from anypony, who would it be?
<Gilda> Yeuch!
<Nickel_Scream> hahah
<HaysforPonies> Fluttershy.
<Gilda> Gross, man!
<Nuclear> ?
<Nickel_Scream> what about boy ponies gilda?
<Gilda> His lips'd be pretty swollen by the time he'd get them back!
<RaZor> Yeah, it probably aired, but I never watched it
<RainBroDash> again, no worries from me
<Sathi> he seems passionate about it
<Parchment_Scroll> Wait, so you'd remove his lips, beat the crap out of them, then GIVE THEM BACK? Talk about insult to injury!
<RainBroDash> ^
<RobotPinkie> Well it was pulled after the second or third season, I think... Some kid was killed by other kids, and they blamed it on Power Rangers.
<Sathi> 7i'm sure you guys can handle it
<Gilda> All I'm saying, paper dude, is don't try it.
<RobotPinkie> I blame shitty parenting, but what do I know? :P
<Sathi> 7or do you want me to put it off?
<RaZor> Well I was born '92, did it still air by then?
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<FluffyWuffs|Drawing> good day evrypony
<Parchment_Scroll> Don't worry.
<Octavia> I'm on the fence, but I missed a good bit of his interview too.
<RainBroDash> 10RaZor is my age :D
<RobotPinkie> Oh, lol, you were probably too young when it aired, then
<Nickel_Scream> You seem grumpy gilda. want a hug?
<RaZor> Yeah, '92 is the best year
<Parchment_Scroll> I'd say "no" is a pretty safe bet there.
<RobotPinkie> >mfw I'm a decade older than RaZor
<RainBroDash> 10ftw
<Gilda> Grumpy? Gilda? Please.
<RainBroDash> 10like it matters or anything :P
<Octavia> 14Jeez, you guys make me feel old.
<RobotPinkie> lolol really, Octavia?
<RainDancer> Y'all just ain't cool enough, methinks.
<Octavia> 14Ya rly
<RobotPinkie> You're even older than me? :O
<Octavia> 14 92... younger than my little sister. :P
<RaZor> My sister is born '94
<RaZor> December 31st
<RainBroDash> 10my sister's older than me. I'm the youngest
<RobotPinkie> I'm curious now, how old are you, Octavia ?
<Parchment_Scroll> Says someone who uses "methinks" in casual conversation.
<Nickel_Scream> I'm pretty cool.
<Nickel_Scream> I own a bow tie
<Octavia> 14 26 in less than a month from now.
<Nuclear> Pffft
<Parchment_Scroll> Bow ties are cool.
<Lawdee> And then I was back
<RobotPinkie> Oh wow... now I feel old again....
*Parchment_Scroll hoofs Nickel_Scream a fez.
<Sathi> 7i'm older.. *shy voice*
<Nuclear> I own an entire nuclear stockpile
<Nuclear> Sup Lawdee!
<Octavia> 14dat tiny spaceship
<Larscis> Next up: Gilda races and F-35 Lightning II. For more on this, we go now to the F-35 construction and testing facility in Marietta, Georgia
<RobotPinkie> I'm betting you're still younger than me, Sathi :P
<Octavia> 14And lol
<Lawdee> Nothing at all....
<Nuclear> Pffft
*Gilda 's eyes narrow
<RobotPinkie> Though I guess I wouldn't know...
<Nuclear> That F-35
<Rinbardosh> ohai Power Rangers
*Sathi 7fluttershies
<RobotPinkie> I'm 30... I feel ancient...
<RainDancer> Pfft.. F-35? Saturn V would be more challenging.
<Octavia> Well, I do like the word "yessums".. lol
<Lawdee> Brb
<Larscis> Well it was either that or the P-51 we keep in the hall closet
<Nuclear> Would get smoked by a SR-71/A
<Rinbardosh> @pony Ocatavia's wafiu forever

<Lawdee> lol
<Nuclear> LOL
<RaZor> Oh god not Twist
*RobotPinkie meows at Sathi
<Nuclear> And I'm pretty sure
<Larscis> Nuclear: In a straight line and after the in-flight refuel.
<MrPoniator> Out of nowhere
<MrPoniator> VIC VIPER
*Sathi 7meows softly
<Nuclear> No one could keep up Saturn V....
<RobotPinkie> So... much older than me?
<Nuclear> Oh yeah...
<RobotPinkie> lolol I know, that's probably an insensitive question...
<Octavia> 14Twist?! Ugh!
<Octavia> 14@pony Octavia's real waifu
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Octavia's real waifu is 7Scoota6loo
<RainBroDash> 10*ahem* No get is better than this fail->win:http://i.imgur.com/dgnSy.png

<AllisZero> Whoa
<Sathi> 7nothing more, nothing less
<AllisZero> I thought I was pretty old.
<RainBroDash> 10RobotPinkie wasn't the Blue ranger the gay one?
<AllisZero> But I'm glad I found some older bronies to hang out with.
<RobotPinkie> Even better, RainBroDash :3
<RainBroDash> 10ikr :D
<RainBroDash> I lol'd
<RainBroDash> lol'd so hard
<Rinbardosh> Obviously Green Ranger is best Ranger
<RainDancer> Hmm.
<RobotPinkie> Me too, AllisZero
<Sathi> he's a winner to me
<RainBroDash> 10Teal Ranger is best Ranger
<RobotPinkie> well, I'm glad so many cool people like FiM :3
<RainBroDash> ^
<RobotPinkie> You mean Green Ranger?
<RainBroDash> 10nah I mean Teal Ranger
<RobotPinkie> if so, sure, but he's not on until next season :D
<RainBroDash> sounds like a fair answer?
<Hipster_Brony> im gonna withhold judgment til i read the full transcript
<RaZor> By the way, I'm pretty sure I had an interview scheduled for about now
<RainBroDash> alrighty
<RainBroDash> 10yeah the last one ran over a teency weency bit
<Rinbardosh> http://knowyourmeme.com/videos/14829-supercut-movie-clich%C3%A9s
<RainBroDash> 10we'll be with you very shortly <3
<RaZor> Yeah, because I need to eat something too
<Octavia> Yeah, I missed some of his interview as well.
<Blums> gilda vs voyageur 2 in a race?
<Blums> to jupiter?
<RainBroDash> gonna say when he'll find out and stuff?
<RobotPinkie> Stream's derpin' for me though... :(
*ValtheJean is running
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<RainBroDash> 10<3 n'awww
<Rinbardosh> Would you guys consider Rollerball(1975) an A or B movie?
<RainBroDash> 10checking it up 1 sec
<Sathi> interview is on the forums
<ValtheJean> haha! No wai! It's Power Rangers! :D
<Sathi> next candidate coming in now
<RainBroDash> 10" In the future there will be no war. There will only be Rollerball."
<RainBroDash> 10errr tbh sounds B to me
<RainBroDash> 10:P
<Rinbardosh> It's a great movie, the remake sucks though
*Aristeo nods
<ValtheJean> this is my childhood right here
*Aristeo hugs Kitten
*ValtheJean nostalgias
<Aristeo> WHat kind of tattoo do you want?
<RobotPinkie> I'd say remake is B, original is A, really...
<Octavia> Was he the one from the other day?
<RainBroDash> 10fair enough
<RainBroDash> 10it sounds like 1984 with a sillier sense of focus
<Sathi> we rescheduled this one yes
<RobotPinkie> but I guess it's not entirely clear cut... like Running Man
<RainBroDash> 10i need to brb quick
<Rinbardosh> mfw http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/166/048/earthquake08232011-neverforget.jpg?1314228190
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<Octavia> 14Lmao
<RobotPinkie> We will rebuild!
<ValtheJean> lol
<RobotPinkie> stream's not derpin' for anyone else?
<Rodman> HAI BRONIES!
<ValtheJean> looks good to me
<ValtheJean> hello Rodman
<Rodman> Its derpin a bit for me
<Rodman> Hi ValtheJean
<Hipster_Brony> read interview and voted
<Rodman> AWWW YEAH, BONE AND SKULL!
<RobotPinkie> hey Rodman
<Rodman> Hi RobotPinkie
<ValtheJean> Not the hugs! NOT THE HUGS
<RobotPinkie> IT BURNS!
<Rodman> Who's streaming this?
<ValtheJean> lol, is anyone reminded of the Animaniacs parody of Power Rangers?
<RobotPinkie> Sathi is streaming
<Rodman> I don't remember it
<Rodman> Mind linking?
<Sathi> can someone take over?
<Sathi> I nearly broke my neck
<Sathi> bleeding and all that
<ValtheJean> sure lemme find it
<RainBroDash> 10..Are you okay?

<ValtheJean> you beat me to it :(
<Sathi> i'll clean and fresh up
<Hipster_Brony> we can take over, go take care of yourself
<RobotPinkie> I'm sorry :(
<Rodman> Sathi, just letting you know, the stream is lagging
<Rodman> Although I don't know if its only for me
<ValtheJean> it might be your internet connection rodman
<RobotPinkie> For me too
<Rinbardosh> mfw vultures in her hat
<RobotPinkie> and I think it's veemi that does it
<Octavia> o.o
<RobotPinkie> again, I can watch youtube at 720p with no lag... :P
<ValtheJean> hmm
<RobotPinkie> so it's probably some bottleneck at Veemi, might be a difference depending on where it's streaming to or something.
<Rodman> Ah, well I guess that makes sense
<Rodman> DAT WB-BOT!
<RobotPinkie> oh well, it's derpin' little enough that it's still fun to watch, now
<RobotPinkie> ...and when I say that, stream freezes completely, lol
<ValtheJean> lol
<Rodman> Oh irony
<ValtheJean> wait a minute
<ValtheJean> WAIT A MINUTE

<ValtheJean> and he had his flute :P
<Sathi> banged my head against the balcony door
<RainDancer> Hoya, User!
<Rinbardosh> Hey kids, playing with a giant bug is not cool
<Octavia> 14Ouch
<RobotPinkie> Yeah but I think he's on much later in the season, or season 2 maybe...
<User_8144> I'm new to ED.
<ValtheJean> ah
<GumballCrash> anyone know where I can get a massive pile of MLP music, official or fanmade, preferably in one giant file?
<CrossBreeze> And I'm here finally. How's he doing so far?
<RobotPinkie> also I think he switches color at the end of season 2 or so
<GumballCrash> my iPod needs some friendship and magic
<RobotPinkie> It's been a while, so I don't remember all of it, lolz
<rachel> not the latter
*Rinbardosh realizes he didn't finish the Fallout Equestria chapter last night'

<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<firelight> yees
<firelight> yes!
<User_8144> I dunno the link
<rachel> got about an hour of pony music on my iphone now, but it was all collected piecemeal usually via links on youtube videos
<GumballCrash> argh
<RobotPinkie> POWER GLOVE!
<GumballCrash> someone's gotta make like, a top 50 playlist/torrent
<ValtheJean> I'd laugh if someone just walked up "POWER CARPET BOMB BITCHES"
<rachel> to get you started: http://tindeck.com/users/PinkiePieSwear
<rachel> these are good
<ValtheJean> and then they all died
<GumballCrash> good start indeed :-D
<Sathi> We had a perfect 1st interview
<Sathi> it's on the forums already
<Hipster_Brony> you ok, sathi?
<rachel> played them now far more often than the last three radiohead albums (all paid for), and i consider(ed) myself a big radiohead fan. :-}
<Rinbardosh> I know that feel Bromine
<Sathi> a bit dizzy but okay
<CrossBreeze> Alright, I'll go check it.
<rachel> ponies have undone me
<Sathi> and in pain.. but I guess that's normal if you bleed
<Hipster_Brony> you might want to go to a doctor and get checked out
<ValtheJean> Dance Zim dance!
<Hipster_Brony> you might have a concussion
<Rinbardosh> Wanna hear a joke about Nitric Oxide? No
<RobotPinkie> I keep thinking Kamen Rider would do a much better job at fighting monsters.
<Sathi> I will tomorrow
<RobotPinkie> unless Den-O...
<Hipster_Brony> >sexy as hell
<Octavia> 14lol
<Sathi> heh yea lol don't know what so say next :P
<Rinbardosh> Is Silicon the same in Spanish? Si
<GumballCrash> I never thought I would do it, but I legally supported ponies by buying the season off iTunes
<GumballCrash> not a penny wasted IMO
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Music: Diamond Dog Mines racing theme / Pinkie Party Anthem / WWU Trance (http://tinyurl.com/3merhrl)
<rachel> i *would* buy it off itunes given half the chance, fo rthe same reason
<RainDancer> User_8144, do you know how to change your nick?
<Hipster_Brony> say pics or it isnt true :3
<ValtheJean> oh dose chem jokes :P
<rachel> in fact when the official mlp twitter account just invited me to i replied fairly instantly with why i can't. don't suppose they'll get the hint any more now than in the past though

<ValtheJean> lol
<Octavia> 14He doesnt sit right with me. And I'm not entirely sure why...
<Octavia> 14Hes a little bit of a suck up, but most are. :P
<Hipster_Brony> i like that he has mod experience
*CrossBreeze continues to wear his unimpressed face until he becomes more confident.
<Hipster_Brony> but his availability isnt great
<Octavia> 14Val raped with his application and interview. lol
<Hipster_Brony> and he has the same problem as dermathil, he is just generic and unimpressive
<ValtheJean> lol, Zordan looks like Charle's Foster Kane
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, val's was great
<Lawdee> Dammit hey jude, why did I decide to learn you one evening before im supposed to know you
<Octavia> 14Yeah, I'm noticing hes a bit on the generic side
<Lawdee> Whatever :3
<RobotPinkie> I guess a bit
<Lawdee> Whats going on in threw wheels of bronydom
<Sathi> you guys want to inform Val straight away or wait till after the weekend?
<Octavia> 14Up to you guys, I'm fine either way.
<CrossBreeze> Hmm... I don't see any reason to put it off. Might as well give him some time to learn how it all works.
<Sathi> yea but since Dari is not around till monday
<Hipster_Brony> lets inform him, but wait til next week to mod him
<CrossBreeze> ^
<Sathi> ok
<Octavia> 14That works.
<Hipster_Brony> cuz its gonna be hard to get him fully trained for tomorrows show
<Sathi> true
<Octavia> 14Indeed.
<RobotPinkie> Yuna summons Titan
<Octavia> 14My first one. I'm nervous.
<ValtheJean> She's going to need Yojimbo for this!
<RobotPinkie> wait, he's not even in that game...
<Sathi> 7Sorry guys I had a little accident at home.. will visit the doctor tomorrow to be on the safe side

<Hipster_Brony> btw sathi, 2 things

*CrossBreeze pats Octavia on the back.
<CrossBreeze> It's real simple, you'll get the hang of it, no prob.
<Hipster_Brony> 1. do you have the movie downloaded yet?
<Sathi> 7I was walking with the cat litter box and did not notice the many cables on the ground..
<ValtheJean> :(
<Fooby> I'm a little confused as to why EAD is more active than here :U
<Fooby> Where'd you all go
<RobotPinkie> owowow
*ValtheJean hugs Sathi
<BitZero> To the abyss.
<crono_flash> Hope your ok Sathi
<Sathi> 7I banged my head against the balcony door and I got wounds on my leg and elbow
<RobotPinkie> Tripped with the box, I take it.
<Fooby> That sounds terrifying
<Blums> maybe everypony went to EAD then
<Fooby> unless the abyss leads to Equestria
<Sathi> of course
<Sathi> :)
<ValtheJean> well I hope everything turns out okay
<RobotPinkie> oww, I'm sorry to hear that Sathi
<Nuclear> Hey FallSilently!

<AllisZero> Doing horrible
<ValtheJean> :(
<AllisZero> Not only dat comic, but I just read part of the plot for Titanic from Cracked
<ValtheJean> what's wrong allis?
<ValtheJean> ah
<Locke> Who agrees with me that this would be a good battle song for Raindbow Dash
<AllisZero> TALES OF OLD AGE ABOUND
<Locke> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8SL6ooUHoo&feature=related
<RainbowBrisk> i think it's a better battle song for Noel :P
<Hipster_Brony> >inb4 might give a warning for image 4
<Locke> I am aware
<RobotPinkie> argh, I wish I knew how to make the stream not derp
<VioletVanilla> Good to hear! ;D
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<Locke> I just think it woild fit dash too
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Blazblue OST - 04 Bullet Dance
<VioletVanilla> Except for Allis o:
<Octavia> 14inafter
<Locke> Late derpy bot is latte
<RainbowBrisk> doesn't sound very dashy to me.
<RainbowBrisk> it sounds fast, but then again all the bb songs do
<Sathi> game over
<RainbowBrisk> my favorite bb song was condemnation wings
<Octavia> 14Image 4 is the easy one too

<AllisZero> I'll go home, watch some ponies

<NightFlare> darn
*CrossBreeze facedesks
*RobotPinkie parties
<AllisZero> I knew I should've stopped hours ago
*VioletVanilla partied with RobotPinkie
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, the only thing that could make it worse is if it had visible genitalia, srsly
<CaptainCog> !seen KnightLight
<RobotPinkie> Though AllisZero, srsly, don't play that game I linked you to, then...
<RainbowBrisk> i never liked Red Line
<ValtheJean> lol Allis, we've gotta get that frown upside down!
<CaptainCog> oh right, durr
<RobotPinkie> It's NOT going to help at all
<Sathi> 7another doctor :P
<Octavia> 14Mhm
<CaptainCog> she's being upgraded
<RainbowBrisk> but i never liked...well anything about Arakune
<NightFlare> hey cog
<ValtheJean> LET THE PONY PICTURES BEGIN!
<VioletVanilla> I know what this needs. . .
<VioletVanilla> A PARTYYYYY!!!
<RainbowBrisk> i got to know pretty much every character in BB since i played it so much
<RobotPinkie> YAY PONY PICS!
<RainbowBrisk> mind you, i wasn't good with every character
<AllisZero> Yeah, I kinda don't want to play it
<Locke> I play Carl mostly
<RainbowBrisk> but i understood how every character played
<ValtheJean> dat Pinkie :D
<RainbowBrisk> except Arakune
<RainbowBrisk> he's always been foreign to me.
<Octavia> 14Though I understand what he means by high tolerance, as I do too. Because of that I have to set personal judgment totally aside and make sure I'm following the rules closely.
<RainbowBrisk> i main Tao and Rachel
<Blums> ponies.
<RainbowBrisk> mostly Tao
<RainbowBrisk> i alt everyone else depending on my mood
<RainbowBrisk> mostly Tsubaki and Ragna
<RobotPinkie> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnsky58NdW1qincmao1_500.jpg
<Locke> Carl and Rachel. I use Toa whenever I fight Noel or Nu
<RainbowBrisk> but then everyone alts Ragna because Ragna is easymode.
<ValtheJean> dawwwwwww
<RobotPinkie> That might help, though
<AllisZero> Dawd
<Blums> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/49642 Nooooooo!
<Locke> It's more like Ragna is simple and everyone else is complicated.
<Hipster_Brony> this guy is a no to me
<RainbowBrisk> yeah
<RainbowBrisk> that's what i mean
<CrossBreeze> Obvious no to me.
<Locke> I mean most fighting games don't have characters with these unique abilites.
<Octavia> 14Besides the image portion, I was just unimpressed as a whole.
<RobotPinkie> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpf3ijJ88V1qincmao1_500.jpg
<Octavia> 14Felt bland.
<RainbowBrisk> like the drives?
<RainbowBrisk> well
<Rinbardosh> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/list/000/037/435/28845116.jpg?1264295317
<VioletVanilla> FIRE ER
<VioletVanilla> TO THE MOOOOON
<AllisZero> That's a very well done picture
<Locke> Well I mean. Not many fighting games has a character that's two characters.
<AllisZero> The coloring, sharing, I like it
<RainbowBrisk> BB has a name for them, so they SEEM more diverse than they are
<RainbowBrisk> yeah Carl is out there
<rachel> argh, beeping!
<MrPoniator> Oh, BlazBlue talk?
<RainbowBrisk> but Tao sorta plays like people from other fighting games and Ragna plays like Sol and Jin plays like Ky
<Locke> What I really mean is most fighting games the characters are more unifrom.
<RainbowBrisk> et cetera et cetera
<RainbowBrisk> see i'd agree with you that you're right, per say
<RainbowBrisk> but
<MrPoniator> Tao sorta plays like... Who?
<Dashite> Oh hey! VioletVanilla is around!
<RainbowBrisk> eh i dunno
<Hipster_Brony> >mfw interviewing, ship-teasing and spidermanning at the same time
<Locke> Like a feleica?
<Sathi> Alright re-inviting Val in
<RainbowBrisk> never played much GG so can't think of an example
<RainbowBrisk> but
<MrPoniator> I can't think of any other game than Arcana Heart
<RainbowBrisk> no
<Dashite> Haven't seen you in awhile.
<ValtheJean> alrighty, let's see if this'll cheer you up allis
<Sathi> you guys ready?
<Hipster_Brony> k
<RainbowBrisk> not felicia
<Locke> Nah
<RainbowBrisk> hsien ko
<RainbowBrisk> a bit
<VioletVanilla> DASHITE!!
<MrPoniator> because that series has a dedicated dash button
<Hipster_Brony> eeeeeeeyup
<RobotPinkie> ohey Dashite
<RainbowBrisk> anyway
*VioletVanilla ponypounces Dashite
<RainbowBrisk> i think that if you get really in depth
<Locke> I was going to say a bit more like Jon Tolbain's dash move
<Octavia> 14Eeeeeeeeenope
<RobotPinkie> what's that? More Luna?
<Octavia> 14Kidding, lets get to it
<RobotPinkie> http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lp7gv2piyU1qincmao1_500.png
<RainbowBrisk> there are tons of fighters way deeper than BB
<ValtheJean> howdy dashite
<Dashite> Hey people.
<MrPoniator> Yeah, there are
<Rinbardosh> more woona
<RainbowBrisk> but on it's face, BB seems more diverse in it's characters
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/5024b34c21b8b56635b1916d218624d9.png
<Sathi> 7ValtheJean: PM
<Rinbardosh> ohai Dashite
<MrPoniator> Guilty Gear being among the most technical there is
<RainbowBrisk> mind you, i think BB is the best fighting game series
<Locke> Jon Tolbain is one oif my favriot fighting characters ever.
<RainbowBrisk> at least it's my favorite
<RainbowBrisk> so i'm not knocking BB :P
<Locke> Werewolf WITH Nunchucks!
<RobotPinkie> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jyHlQRtdqF4/TfruyHoHuBI/AAAAAAAAGBY/duLZ6wulHpY/s1600/25127+-+0r0ch1+drunk+luna+princess+spike.png
<RainbowBrisk> lol
<MrPoniator> But yeah, GG and BB
<MrPoniator> Some of the most diverse fighting games there are
<Locke> They only reason I don't want another Darkstalkers is becuase Capcom has been making everything in 3D
<Dashite> Poor Spike. :D
<AllisZero> Moe luna
<RainbowBrisk> mvc2 and 3 have a pretty diverse cast
<Dashite> Deus Ex finally arrived.
<RainbowBrisk> by virtue that they have so many characters
<MrPoniator> True
<Locke> I know 3d is easier to make, but 2d fighters don't feel right with 3d characters.
<Locke> They feel slower.
<RobotPinkie> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-houston-were-coming-home.jpg
<FallSilently> 3D isn't bad. The 3D updates of both Street Fighter and MvC are both excellent.
<Locke> Meh
<RobotPinkie> Aw fuck, that was the best one, too...
<MrPoniator> But heh, MvC2 is laughable, seeing how the characters are ridicilously unbalanced
<RobotPinkie> chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-houston-were-coming-home.jpg
<MrPoniator> But can't really balance a fighter with that big roster
<Hipster_Brony> dat cliffhanger sathi
<RainbowBrisk> mvc2 is also ridiculously complex and deep.
<Octavia> 14Indeed indeed :P
<RainbowBrisk> with horrible character balance
<RobotPinkie> lol wish I knew which images work and not...
<RainbowBrisk> but known for having some of the best fighting mechanics ever
<Locke> I think they all felt better with 2d characters. MvC3 and Street Fighter 4 felt a lot slower than previous games.
<VioletVanilla> O:
<RainbowBrisk> SFIV is not a slow game.
<VioletVanilla> @Dashite: Lemme play it? ;3
<MrPoniator> I've just come to it that I enjoy SNK and ArcSys fighters more than Capcom
<FallSilently> Street Fighter IV is a deliberately slower game than SFIII but get two fast characters like Yun and Ibuki together and the speed outmatches any 2D game. So it's not down to technical limits.
<RainbowBrisk> it seems a bit slow until you get into it.
<Locke> then again it's been a long time sense I played Street fighter 3.
<RainbowBrisk> it's faster than SF2
<RainbowBrisk> 3 i'd say is comparable.
<Locke> Main point is. I just liked the 2D better.
<RainbowBrisk> anyway
<RainbowBrisk> i gotta go
<Dashite> Sorry, but I've got first dibs. I've have people attempting to spoil me all week with story details and "Haha! I'm playing already! See, if you'd just ordered on Steam you could have been playing too! :p"
<RainbowBrisk> i think i left my wallet at this diner i went to
<RainbowBrisk> and i have to find my fucking walle.
<RainbowBrisk> wallet*
<RainbowBrisk> which is worrying because i have no idea where it is
<MrPoniator> SFIV's speed doesn't bother me that much, but rather the stiffiness, seeing how BB/GG/Arcana Heart/etc give more freedom for the character to move around
<VioletVanilla> >:
<Locke> hat might be what I'm thinking off.
<RobotPinkie> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/152/c/5/luna_and_space_core__colored__by_frankier77-d3hu0j4.jpg
<VioletVanilla> I understaaaand~
<firelight> No I had lunch yet and already the 3
<VioletVanilla> The meanies shouldn't do that to you though. . .
<Octavia> 14We have one more today dont we?
<RobotPinkie> Oh you know you love Luna
<FallSilently> The characters can feel a bit stiff. I definitely think Ryu looks floatier than his 2D versions, especially when doing his hurricane kick.
<VioletVanilla> ^ Love it RobotPinkie~
<Locke> I also like fighters with a lot of three movement. Like Dissidia.
<EdwardNewgate> dat insult
<VioletVanilla> but where are her socks? c;
<RobotPinkie> :P
<Locke> *free
<Sathi> nope
<Sathi> we're done
<FallSilently> It's been a few years since I gave GG a go. I'll have to get it off my brother next time I see him.
<Octavia> 14Oh, last was the third.
<RobotPinkie> Socks are off! http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpbqtbES4Y1qincmao1_500.png
<Sathi> We are out of candidates :D
<MrPoniator> I've been playing GGXXAC+ occassionally with a couple of buddies
<Octavia> 14Thought we were just finished the second. :P
<MrPoniator> Need to learn dem Baiken combos better, though
<Octavia> 14See what happens when you come in late? lol
<Locke> Well Today I plan to start playing as Ultimecia
<MrPoniator> And timing Baiken's mat and inputing tk srk give some frustration at times
<CrossBreeze> So... what's that, six new mods total?
<Octavia> 14Loooooooooots of mods
<FallSilently> Hellew
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony that looks best in socks
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that looks best in socks is 7G5ild15a
<Locke> I would love to see Sega make a cross over fighter
<RobotPinkie> Missed such a great opportunity, Steven....
<Octavia> 14lol
<Locke> If only for the virtue of having Sonic and Bayonetta fight
<Sathi> well we need looooots of mods
<CrossBreeze> Doubling the mod team in ten seconds flat.
<VioletVanilla> @pony The pony that adores Octavia
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that adores Octavia is 5Doctor Whooves
<Sathi> Btw CB & Octavia
<EdwardNewgate> @pony Pony that hates Dari
<FallSilently> Sega's characters tend to be too cuddly for a serious crossover.
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Pony that hates Dari is 12Spit8f7ire
<Octavia> 14Yessssss?
<Sathi> can you PM Sprinkles on the forums?
<Sathi> He needs info for the about section
<crono_flash> @pony The pony that is most like House is
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that is most like House is is 5Little Strong7heart
<Octavia> 14Ah, yeah.
<Octavia> 14He asked me about that.
<Sathi> just a friendly reminder
<RobotPinkie> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lo9ydtmj5Z1qincmao1_500.png
<Octavia> 14I gave him info, but I think he left. lol Will do.
<Locke> Who said it had to be series
<Locke> *serious
<RobotPinkie> I wish that were a wallpaper instead...
<Blums> sonic= around the speed of sound. Bayonetta= FTL fighter
<Blums> wot?
<Barry> What do you think of this piece of music?
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwORu4adPxw&feature=related
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "KH2-Tension Rising-Nightmare Remix" - "This is a remix from Kingdom Hearts 2 I made. Enjoy fans! Also if you want to download it, give me yuor e-mail address and I&#39;ll send it over!"
<FallSilently> Well... you did mention Bayonetta....
<Locke> Fighting game logic
*CrossBreeze sighs.
<MrPoniator> Solid Snake fighting Mario, no logic needed
<CrossBreeze> I thought I already gave him that in the skype.
<Locke> Exactly
<Blums> XD
<Sathi> I think he missed it
<CrossBreeze> I'll do it on the forums.
<Sathi> thanks
<FallSilently> SSBB isn't exactly a serious fighter.
<CrossBreeze> yep yep.
<Locke> I repeat
<Locke> Who said it needed to be serious
<Barry> @pony the pony who hates socks
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony who hates socks is 6Spik3e
<Locke> as long as the fighting is good it doesn't matter.
<FallSilently> I prefer serious fighters.
<MrPoniator> Mixing up "serious" as in "grimdarkey-ish" or "competetive"?
<RainbowBrisk> competitive
<RainbowBrisk> SSBB is a party game.
<VioletVanilla> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12VioletVanilla is 7Ste6ven Mag7net
<Locke> that depends
<Barry> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Barry is 13Pinkie 4Pie
<FallSilently> That's what I'm getting at.
<Barry> I'm a party pony
<RobotPinkie> sounds a lot like boss music
<Locke> It's generally a party game.
<VioletVanilla> It is
<Locke> But some players make it very serious
<Firestar778> OMG U HAVE TO SEE THIS
<RobotPinkie> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12RobotPinkie is 7Ste6ven Mag7net
<Firestar778> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkxLzKC3RlM&feature=related
<Barry> It's a remix of one
<RainbowBrisk> people take it seriously
<FallSilently> I can totally see a Sega fighter but it would never be up there with Street Fighter.
<RobotPinkie> Nice.
<RainbowBrisk> but people take My Little Pony seriously too
<MrPoniator> I thought you meant as in dark-ish, how you said about Bayonetta, Fall
<RainbowBrisk> and it's not a serious thing
<Firestar778> U HAVE TO
*Locke takes all his gaming seriously
<Locke> You should see me play mario party
<RobotPinkie> though... how can we both be him?
<RobotPinkie> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12RobotPinkie is 10Trix11ie
<RainbowBrisk> well i dont think people are scrambling to sign up for mario party at evo
<MrPoniator> And well, with crossovers it may not be necessary to have it very deep and complex
<RobotPinkie> Nowai
<FallSilently> It would need to be somewhere between Smash Bros and MvC. Sega does have serious IPs like Virtua Fighter, but most of their stuff is more Nintendo-ey.
*VioletVanilla ponypounces RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> Ship me with myself, now!
<RobotPinkie> :P
<VioletVanilla> Trixie be my fillyfooler~ :3
<Locke> Doesn't mean it can't be a serious fighting game
<MrPoniator> I find Virtua Fighter rather boring to play, though
<Firestar778> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkxLzKC3RlM&feature=related
<Locke> It just means have the characters won't be serious
<FallSilently> I don't play Virtua Fighter myself.
<Firestar778> !Muffin
<Locke> *half
<RobotPinkie> Does that mean Steven Magnet is pouncing me?
*EdwardNewgate ponyglomps VioletVanilla
<RobotPinkie> That could hurt... a lot
<MrPoniator> But yeah, Sega will likely try to mass-appeal with a more simple pick-up-and-play style
<FallSilently> Well, if half the characters aren't serious, then it can't be a serious game ;)
*VioletVanilla ish ponyglomp'd by EdwardNewgate
<MrPoniator> If they ever make a crossover fighter
<VioletVanilla> Helloooooo Edwaaarrrrddddd~~ [:
<Locke> Serious characters and serious game are two different things
<EdwardNewgate> ohai Violet

<ValtheJean> that is true
<ValtheJean> that is very true
<RobotPinkie> and look at what I said above...

<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that's most likely to be inside the Rainbow Dash disguise just to get close to VioletVanilla is 15Sweetie 6Be13ll6e

<VioletVanilla> Oh dearie me. . . .-.
<Octavia> 14I still have to look at Razors again, but I will.
<SummerRain> lol Atomic is sleeping?
<FallSilently> Does Celestia ever actually use Magic, actually? Neither uses their horns much.
<VioletVanilla> I'd rather be with RobotPinkie D;
<SummerRain> at this hour?
<Barry> @pony the pony who will be shipped with Edwardnewgate
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony who will be shipped with Edwardnewgate is 15Rari6ty
<FallSilently> I dunno where in the world Atomic is.
<EdwardNewgate> That actually sounds pretty cool
<SummerRain> he never sleeps now, he's usually at work right now..
<FallSilently> Might be early there.
<WhatPayne> I know! I've been watching that show for almost six months and only now realized that... Heck I even made huge fanart with Celestia in it
<Daz> @Pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Daz is 7G5ild15a
<RobotPinkie> It's only because I'm Trixie :P
<RobotPinkie> hey Daz
<VioletVanilla> <33 How'd you know?
<Locke> ...
*SummerRain headche headche
<Barry> So, what is DMan's preferred name now?
<Locke> You drew them and still didn't notice
<Sumica> lo all
<WhatPayne> Yes... yes I did...
<Daz> Hi, RobotPinkie. And Barry - My real name is Daz, i just used 'dman' for a while, but it's Daz
<ValtheJean> hello sumica
<RobotPinkie> No one can escape the psychic powers of the Great and Powerful Trixie, VioletVanilla
<EdwardNewgate> ohai Sumica
<Barry> Hi Sumica, and ah, Daz
<RobotPinkie> hey Sumica
<Barry> What did you think of my LoZ/MLP story?
<Sumica> heh, countducula eh?
<WhatPayne> I mean I realized that as racial lines go they do not belong to particular one group
<Daz> So how are ya Barry?
<VioletVanilla> Heheheh~
<Barry> I'm good
<SummerRain> :p chat is rather boring right now
<WhatPayne> Earth Pony/Unicorn/Pegasus
<DerpyBot> *derp*
<SummerRain> not as many active users
<RobotPinkie> I'm nostalgia-ing so hard right now...
<FallSilently> I think the unofficial term is "alicorn."
<VioletVanilla> So are you going to use those powers on me Pi-- Trixie? ;3
<SummerRain> see ya guys
<Barry> from what?
<SummerRain> have stuff to do anyways
<FallSilently> See yah later!
<SummerRain> may be back soon
<SummerRain> either really soon, soon..
<Barry> @pony Pinkie Pie really
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Pinkie Pie really is 2Princess L10una
<RobotPinkie> @pony RobotPinkie's secret identity
<Steven_Magnet> 6 RobotPinkie's secret identity is 5Chief Thund11erho15oves
<SummerRain> or a little later
<WhatPayne> Now that I think about it they are perfect leaders, representing all three types and whatnot
<RobotPinkie> ...oh no :(
<VioletVanilla> D;
<ValtheJean> RobotPinkie has always been Chief Thunderhooves
<RobotPinkie> I hope you still love giant muscular buffalo
<ValtheJean> he was the year before that
<ValtheJean> and the year before that
<FallSilently> Well, I dunno about "perfect" leaders....
<Blums> except earth ponies are kind of the base
<ValtheJean> and the year before that...
<RobotPinkie> and the year before that
<Barry> ENOUGH!!
<RobotPinkie> and the year before that
<Locke> I remember before MLP people called them Pegacorns
<Blums> pegasus = everything an earth pony can do +wings and cloud manip
<WhatPayne> ... This awakes some obvious questions...
<Blums> unicorn= everything an earth pony can do +magic
<Barry> The "year before that" thing just gets old, fast
<RobotPinkie> You don't love buffalo, VioletVanilla? :(
<EdwardNewgate> 0and the millenia before that
<EdwardNewgate> 0and the millenia before that
<ValtheJean> yeah, that's why I stopped :P
<FallSilently> Hopefully they'll think up something that makes earth ponies unique in S2.
<RobotPinkie> That is so racist!
<Blums> alicorn is the term for a unicorn's horn
<Barry> millenia is the plural form of millenium
<Blums> yeah, and have it be something significant
<FallSilently> At the moment they have some special bond with the ground or nature or something but it's never made clear.
<EdwardNewgate> 0no u
<RobotPinkie> lol
<ValtheJean> lol, that is one trippy sarcophagus
<RobotPinkie> Barry is the plural for millenium?
<Kitten> Ari, a star, butterfly, or an inspirational word.. it'll be a smaller one not big and bulky, but cute and petite
<WhatPayne> What would happen if say normal Unicorn and Pegasus ponies would have offspring?
<Barry> Millenia is
<Sathi> 7Looks like House will be a bit later
<RobotPinkie> Well he said "no u", so...
<VampirePrincess> ????
<VampirePrincess> hiya kitten
<Barry> @pony Princess Celestia really
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Princess Celestia really is 5Snai10ls
<Blums> 50/50 chance im guessing?
<Kitten> hi Vampy
<Barry> How does that one work?
<Daz> Barry - I'm very sorry, I haven't read them yet. I just got back from the police station, and i'm, well not to bore you but my mother's losing custody over my and my father's gaining it. i've been busy, but i said I'd read it. I'm sorry. If it's ok, I'd like you to link it to me in a PM, and i can give you a running commentary of what I think of it. Again,
<Locke> yep
<Daz> i'm sorry for not having read it yet.
<VampirePrincess> how ya been?
<Locke> That or the gender rule
<Kitten> and talking about a tattoo i want
<FallSilently> At the moment the fandom seems to accept that a foal's offspring is random. Derpy (pegasus) has a unicorn daughter. Berry Punch (earth) also has a unicorn.
<Kitten> decent, u?
<WhatPayne> So there are hereditary laws in working there?
<ValtheJean> :(
<Barry> That's fine. RL comes first
<RobotPinkie> @pony The biggest troll in all of Equestria
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The biggest troll in all of Equestria is 0,1Z1,0e0,1c1,0o0,1r1,0a
<ValtheJean> I'm sorry to hear that daz
<Locke> not really
<Crainy> so..
<RobotPinkie> That is so racist, Steven...
<Crainy> hi Fall
<Barry> @pony ValtheJean really
<Steven_Magnet> 6 ValtheJean really is 8Flutter13shy
<MrPoniator> Some fandom-based ones only so far
<Crainy> hi Blums
<VampirePrincess> excited. my man is coming to see me. :)
<Daz> Barry - but I said i'd read it. link and PM please :P
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Blums> hi crainy
<Daz> Whatever ValtheJean don't sweat it! ^_^
<Kitten> congrats
<GGgala> ohai Daz--whoa. hope you're okay
<ValtheJean> I-I'm fluttershy? Oh...um...okay...if that's alright with you
<Kitten> but i'm jealous :P
<Crainy> =)
<Crainy> BEST COMMUNITY EVA
<VampirePrincess> lol, sry?
<Crainy> i cant stress it enough!
<RobotPinkie> Ow, I'm sorry Daz
<ValtheJean> well, either way, internet hugs go out to you
<Daz> GGgala, dude, it's fine. In fact, some people (sathi, dari to name a few mods :P) knew this
<WhatPayne> Or is there some rule that even if unicorn and pegasus would have offspring they would only inherit only one characteristic?
<FallSilently> I'd be happy with the random theory. Makes Darwinism less of a threat.
<Daz> ¬_¬ ok seriously now, i don't want your pity, and i'm handling it more than fine, but uh thanks aniways RobotPinkie
*ValtheJean hugs daz
<FallSilently> Unless both parents are the same type, I guess.
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<FallSilently> So far, the show has only shown single-type families. The Apples are all earth, the Pies are all earth etc.
<VampirePrincess> crap i g2g. see ya'll mon or tues.
<Sathi> 7dat tune
<RobotPinkie> not questioning your ability to handle it, Daz, I was just hoping you're doing fine
<FallSilently> Both families are earth, and both families are farmers. Guess that reinforces the "special bond" thing.
<ValtheJean> they stayed with him
<Daz> I'm fine, thank you RobotPinkie. I have set aside time JUST for fluttershy brushie tomorrow ! (FINALLYYYYYY)
<RobotPinkie> Nice :D
<ValtheJean> brushie brushie brushie
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<CogWeaver> TROLL CHECK! *floods room with a wave of lava two pony-heights tall*
<RobotPinkie> wallop
<FreezeFrame> And campus Wi-fi is finally set up.
<CogWeaver> >_>
<CogWeaver> <_<
<RobotPinkie> hey FreezeFrame
<CogWeaver> wellp, no trolls here :I
<FallSilently> Neat troll check. Only the trolls survive.
<WhatPayne> I hope season two touches on this subject...
<ValtheJean> hello freezeframe
<RobotPinkie> might do Pinkie Pie tonight
<RobotPinkie> ...not in that sense, Jesus, you pervs
<rachel> seems unlikely
<RobotPinkie> :P
<rachel> unless they want to make sure they think interracial relationships are ok
<ValtheJean> lol, looks like you were the only one to think that :P
<FallSilently> It's 2011. They're pretty okay.
<rachel> from canon, we only see pure-breds. from fanon it looks like wings are recessive and horns are dominant :-)
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Story: Stolen Harmony (http://tinyurl.com/3djyolz)
<rachel> FallSilently: quite; it's kinda, if they want to nail it
<RobotPinkie> Every waking moment, Val :P
<WhatPayne> It bothers me because I just spent last year studying biology and am interested.
<rachel> as an official stance lest certain people take to presuming otherwise
<ValtheJean> O_o
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<Daz> O LOL RobotPinkie
<FallSilently> Hey Sketchy, you just missed SummerRain.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ach well
<Guest98341> whopss
<Guest98341> wrong channel
<ValtheJean> dat wordplay
<FallSilently> Well that was a nice chap.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm only dropping by briefly before I head home.
<EdwardNewgate> 0ohai Abott and Costello joke
<RobotPinkie> Haha
<ForeverOdin> Hola everyone
<FallSilently> Hellew
<AllisZero> I would kiss Fluttershy on the forehead and stroke her mane until she went to sleep
<RobotPinkie> Who's on first?
<AllisZero> I'm just saiyan
<Larscis> My goldfish claims to be an affront to nature.
<Daz> not that i'd judge you :P aaaaniway it's gonna be weird taking a shower, where I plan to simultaneously get fluttershy's hair wet (dat multitasking, cuz of hot water) (NO F U IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT)
<crono_flash> Waka waka
<RobotPinkie> me too, AllisZero :3
<rachel> moving to other room; may come on from there. i think i'm stuck here though so i'll probably set it up on my proxy at the weekend… :-)
<rachel> !moon
<AllisZero> Daz, hermind?
<ValtheJean> ~You would not believe your eyes, if 10,000 fluttershy's~
*^Stargazer walks in the door with a bag in his mouth containing cherry coke, a pie and a dozen chocolate chip cookies... Is content for this weekend off =D
<rachel> dammit isn't she here?
<FallSilently> You crazy people and your work internet access. I work in a bank. We don't have 'net access so the concept is strange to me.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Wow DerpyBot was slow welcoming me
<Larscis> Also, happy Kiss and Make Up Day.
<Guest98341> didi someone contact me?
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm on my phone :p
<RobotPinkie> Showering with Fluttershy? Sounds like a solid plan!
<Guest98341> did*
<Daz> ~flew in the room as you....went to bed?...forgot lyrics xD
<^Stargazer> not even a phone with internet access?
<FallSilently> Here in Ireland, it's National Potato Day. What a bloody cliche.
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, rachel!
<Daz> RobotPinkie I NO RITE!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Anyway
<AllisZero> I went to sleep*
<ValtheJean> lol
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Locke> Bayonetta just quoted Viewtaful joe
<ForeverOdin> Wow, go Derpy ha
<Daz> ah thanks AllisZero i only know the ending off by heart
<Locke> This game does a lot of refrences.
<FallSilently> We have restricted internet access but for security reasons it only accesses the bank net.
<Daz> ~Cuz i'm obsessed with ponies so it seeeeeeeems~ :3
<^Stargazer> Bayonetta? as in the character from the game?
<Guest98341> oh
<Locke> "Whaddaya buyin? I heard that in a video game once"
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'mma vanish for now, will be online properly in about half an hour.
<ValtheJean> gotta admit, that song is a great lullaby :P
<Locke> Yeah
<Daz> It's awesome!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Later folks!
<^Stargazer> I liked that game, and that remix of fly me to the moon
*ValtheJean is totally going to sing it to his firstborn child
<AllisZero> I gotta admit, I use it as a lullaby...
<RobotPinkie> Myeah
<AllisZero> I've been listening it to constantly before going to bed
<CogWeaver> :I
<ValtheJean> eh, screw that I can't wait. I'll sing it to my niece the next time I sing her
<RobotPinkie> lolol mfw everybrony does
<ValtheJean> see*
<^Stargazer> I feel sorry for the one fearless in one of the boss battles that gets attacked yet never bothers Bayonetta herself =/
<Daz> it's on par with IBRINGDALULZ music, and pony swag, and 'times are a'changing brony' and uh taht new one...yea there's a load of really good fansongs :3
<^Stargazer> *itself
<RobotPinkie> Eeeeeeyup, agreed
<RobotPinkie> haven't really listened to the first guy you mentioned though
<AllisZero> havent listened to any of them
*^Stargazer laughs at the picture of rarity using applejack as a polo horse lol
<CogWeaver> that was an odd picture
<RobotPinkie> but a lot of good fansongs, that's truth
<Daz> RobotPinkie: i g2g dinner now, but when i return i'll link ya my fave fansongs
<Daz> Dinner bai bai all
<ForeverOdin> Haha oh yea

<^Stargazer> I never liked any of the weapons I got in that game after I got the shotgun for her feet and the Katana for her hands
<RobotPinkie> brb, going to put conditioner in Pinkie's hair and get it wet.
<Sumica> sounds like someone pulled a channel swap to get that song.
<Locke> unless I don't get it till after the third chapter
<rachel_> hm
<Locke> Becuease I can't wait till I unlock the ice skares
<^Stargazer> I think he makes them when you get the disk, then you need to buy them don't you?
<Locke> yeah he made the Saruba
<Locke> I just can't find the darn menu to equip it
<^Stargazer> If I could remember I'd tell you... I have the game in my room somewhere ( need to return it to his boss though, is kind of done with the game lol )

<EdwardNewgate> 0Wow, was not expecting that in Fallout: Equestria
<ValtheJean> lol, the tragedy of male bronies: No female hair tools :P
<AllisZero> Baaaats, bats on my face
<AllisZero> Heeeelp

<RobotPinkie> Bats?

<papyruspony> and he fences
<ShadowMane> 'It's never Lupus'
<SummerRain> sounds awfully familiar
<SomeFrenchBrony> It's a brony, who's french
<SummerRain> no kidding.
<Blums> there will never be an episode 3
<papyruspony> well i know no one so i can't help you there
<Blums> instead they're making the third game
<ValtheJean> oooooooohhhhhhh
<ValtheJean> so THAT'S why he needed 5k
<ShadTheCrazed> Maybe Gaben's watching ponies!
<RobotPinkie> I heard that they might use lupus on House, but only for the last episode
<ShadTheCrazed> PONY UPDATE FOR EPISODE 3!
<Blueshade> THis vid explains what happened to episode 3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZaY1jV96jI
<HaysforPonies> I would be okay with a full 3 instead of Episode 3. I would be annoyed to have waited for years just for a 5 hour game.
<AllisZero> Rofl
<^Stargazer> what, pony update for episode 3?
<Blums> there was a "pony farm" in a pit in portal 2
<AllisZero> You guys know
<AllisZero> That
<AllisZero> This chatroom might get me fired one day right
<ValtheJean> :(
<ShadowMane> If I had that bike, i'd buy myself a short-spear and put it in the holder
<AllisZero> I haven't gotten shit done all week!

<RobotPinkie> That's... not good
<AllisZero> BUt it's all so worth it.
<EdwardNewgate> 0and we'll still be here for you

<papyruspony> i might have also kinda said in a screamoish voice my little pony
*ShadowMane is now a superhero
<ValtheJean> does that mean Silvermane is your arch-enemy?
<Daz> Ohai House. and is this a 4th silvermane variant?
<Dermathil> Ohai everybrony
<ShadowMane> of course not. Silvermane is my son, sillys
<ValtheJean> howdy dermathil
<RainBroDash> 10so ShadowMan is now arch-nemesis of SilverMan
<Daz> Sup bro!
<ValtheJean> Father son is a good hero villain combo :P
<GGgala> ohai Dermathil, wb Daz
<Blueshade> Applebloom: Scoota Scootaloo , where are you? We got some work to do now
<Daz> Ty GGgala
<Dermathil> Class ended 30 minutes early
<Daz> hot dogs went down nicely :3
<ValtheJean> nice
<ShadowMane> so Silvermane would have to be the superhero that eventually discovers that I was one of his foes for years and it causes drama
<Daz> Dermathil: what class?
<ShadTheCrazed> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozDvkBe2rdg
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Pinke Pie can&#39;t decide.

<Daz> ...wth is that
<Dermathil> The class is for people who are new to College

<Cracky> except myself
<RobotPinkie> stream's really derpin', gonna have to download to watch this with you guys...
<ValtheJean> 51....k?
<Daz> halp. i got 2 urgent ones to read, and then i'm back t obacklog. i guess ... shouyld I put it 3rd?
<ValtheJean> that's the length of a short novel
<Dermathil> yes Val
<AllisZero> Lol house
<EdwardNewgate> 0Valthejean It took me forever to read
<Dermathil> shows you how much content there is in there.
<ValtheJean> no, it shows the lack of organization
<Dermathil> The entire fic is still incomplete and is over 440k long
<User_3202> haha I just started watching season 1
<Daz> is it well written thou?
<Dermathil> NOPE Valthejean.
<ValtheJean> he needs to cut that back, big time
<Blueshade> It's awesome
<Dermathil> Valthejean, maybe that's because it is the equivalent of 4 chapters?
<EdwardNewgate> 0Val the God of Writing
<Sathi> 7troll
<User_3202> I fully agree 100%
<Blueshade> OI
<Cracky> yes
<Daz> ValtheAuthor
<Dermathil> ValthePen
<ValtheJean> 50k is about the length of a short novel
*Octavia pounces on Sketchy_Sounds. PONY.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I have returned
<Cracky> especialy the part where there are ponies!
*Sketchy_Sounds is pounced!
<FallSilently> yay
<Dermathil> 100 pages?
<Blueshade> pony pony pony pony pony
*Sketchy_Sounds hugs Tavy ^^
<EdwardNewgate> 0Also, how can you say that if you haven't even read it?
<Blueshade> HAHA
<ValtheJean> lol, these nicks....are somewhat filling my ego trip :P
<RobotPinkie> Man, that conditioner really helped Pinkie's hair
<User_3202> pwnies :D
<ValtheJean> because the first rule of editing
<ValtheJean> there is always something to cut back
<Blums> mo ponies
<RobotPinkie> @brushiebrushiemeter RobotPinkie
<Steven_Magnet> 6 RobotPinkie is 83% brushiebrushie. (1517)
<ValtheJean> 50k for a single chapter is excessive
<RobotPinkie> True.
<Daz> ValtheGreat, ValtheMaster, ValtheVisionary :P
<GGgala> yeah, if Fallout: Equestria were put into conventional publishing rules, it would be split into multiple books and form a series/
<Daz> @brushiebrushiemeter Daz
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Daz is 42% brushiebrushie. (1518)
<GGgala> but it's not in conentional rules, it's online.
<HaysforPonies> Pooooooniiies.
<Daz> D: RobotPinkie teach me the ways!
<Dermathil> yeah, GGgala's right.
<EdwardNewgate> 0Valthejean, after reading it he probably did cut back a lot
<ValtheJean> yeah, but it's why I'll never read fanfics :P
<AllisZero> Hm
<Daz> :O it's THAT big?
<User_3202> Ponies forever
<RainBroDash> 10ValtheImpaler
<Dermathil> yes Daz
<ValtheJean> but keep the nicks coming, I haven't NEARLY gotten my ego fed enough :P
<Blueshade> Before FIM: I hate ponies with a passion, After FIM: I F&%KING LOVE PONIES!
<ValtheJean> ooo0oooo
<RainBroDash> 10(mine was best)
<ValtheJean> the Impaler
<AllisZero> Whoa, I had 44k words halfway through the first chapter of my noveru
<ValtheJean> I like that one
<Blums> owlowlicious should record the number of times pony is mentioned
<ValtheJean> Rainbrodash wins a gold star
<Daz> oh gawd...dare I read it. hey um Dermathil / EdwardNewgate what if i've never played any fallouts? still worth reading?
<RainBroDash> 10:D:D:D:D:D:D:DD
<Dermathil> Yes, Daz.
<AllisZero> What fic are you guys talking about though? Fallout Equestria?
<Daz> (ValtheDigger) (Dermathil just punched the air)
<FallSilently> Before FIM, I also hated ponies. After FIM, I continue to hate the ponies I hated before FIM.
<Cracky> Before FiM: I am afraid of ponies, they will eat me!
<GGgala> RANDOM BRONY TRIVIA: the author of /Fallout: Equestria/ , Kkat, is actually female
<Daz> ok...Dermathil it's 3rd now in my list :P
<User_3202> nanananananana ponies!
<RobotPinkie> It's not really that hard to put conditioner in a pony's hair, Daz
<Blums> I went back and watched some pre-fim and stuff and it was ok. wasnt too bad
<EdwardNewgate> 0You'll miss out on a bunch of the allusions, but it'll be worth it
<RobotPinkie> just make sure you rinse it out completely :P
<FallSilently> I did likewise. It was terrible.
<User_3202> Lol pre fim is awkward
<Blueshade> Ponies before fim are just horrible and ugly
<EdwardNewgate> 0mfw I should
<Dermathil> Fallout just helps you see some of the early plot points further in the story
<Daz> so i should put conditioner in, but not much, and then wash it out?
<EdwardNewgate> 0should've known that
<RainDancer> Yes
<rachel> slightly awkwardly, theylook more like actual ponies
<Blums> ponies arent FIM cute in real life you know
<Daz> will shampoo do? (i THINK there's conditioner somewhere but not sure)
<ValtheImpaler> next time Dari tries to troll me, imma just be like: "I WILL IMPALE YOU WITH MY TOOTHBRUSH!"
<Blueshade> I know
<papyruspony> i have an intense love for fim ponies
<FallSilently> Not even the real-life unicorns!?
<RainBroDash> 10ValtheImpaler: http://www.donlinke.com/images/Vlad/vlad_tepes_big-x01.jpg
*Dermathil notices Val's toothbrush is dulled
<User_3202> yeah they're just so cute
<Daz> ValtheImpaler: YOURS IS THE BRUSH THAT WILL PIERCE THE TROLLS!
<ShadowMane> Daz, RobotPinkie... wtf are you talking about
<rachel> fim ponies are proportioned a bit more like bobble-headed llamas, tbh :-}
<RobotPinkie> I don't think so, Daz, hair's clean when it comes out of the box
<Blueshade> FIM reminds me of Sonic when the characters don't look like there real world cunterparts
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<User_3202> >_>
<Blueshade> Clunterparts I mean
<RobotPinkie> Conditioner makes it easier to brush, that's all :P
<Daz> ShadowMane: hair styling
<Blueshade> counterparts
<Blueshade> dope
<rachel> phew, got there
<FallSilently> THANK you
<papyruspony> fim reminds me of all thing good in the world
<ShadowMane> i see that. but... for what
<Daz> oh ok then RobotPinkie. i guess i'll try it. i found a goodish method for Shy , so gonna try tomorrow
<RobotPinkie> Ponies, ShadowMane :P
<Daz> also RobotPinkie what do you use to dry hair?
<Blueshade> MLP: MEN LIKE PONIES. FIM: FAUST IS MASTER
<ShadowMane> i presume toys
<Dermathil> a hair dryer.
<ValtheJean> lol....wow...random disconnect
<Daz> ShadowMane: pubic hair (!) No seriously wth did you think we were on about if not Ponies? :P
<RobotPinkie> Right now? lol a low energy light, I have no hair dryer
<ValtheJean> I guess ValtheImpaler even impales himself!
<User_3202> lol +1
<Blums> faust isnt the head hauncho anymore
<ShadTheCrazed> Blueshade: YES
<RobotPinkie> I'd use a hairdryer, though it's a bit risky
<papyruspony> i know =(
<ShadowMane> Daz, honestly, i've heard weirder conversations on here
<ShadTheCrazed> Yeah. D:
<Daz> but Dermathil is a hair dryer better than just light? why risky RobotPinkie ?
<Cracky> http://blakgryf.deviantart.com/art/Hypno-Pinkie-251679054
<Daz> ShadowMane irk
<Daz> ikr *
<ShadTheCrazed> Oh well, the drug spread good enough for it to be good.
<Blums> besides, she's working more on her Galaxy Girls
<ShadTheCrazed> They're on a drug called Lauren Faust.
<RobotPinkie> Well if you get too close with it the hair can start melting
*ValtheJean wishes he had a pony to discuss brushing strategies
<Daz> D:
<Cracky> ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNO-PINKIE!
<Daz> and ValtheJean go get one!
<ValtheJean> well...I have the McDonald's Rainbodash
<RobotPinkie> the pony can't tell you when it's too hot
<FallSilently> Be right back. I have a budgie that needs to be put to bed.
<Blueshade> Would the show still go on it's constant path of awesome without Lauren
<rachel> faustian bargains have been made!
<ValtheJean> well, I'm waiting for more accurate merchandice
<ValtheJean> dise*
<Daz> also RobotPinkie my dad odesn't mind driving to ToysRUs tomorrow ... i'm getting Rainbow Dash (and rainbow flash) tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<ValtheJean> jeez
<RobotPinkie> I figure as long as you keep it at a bit of a distance it's fine.
<Blums> yes blueshade. and she's still on the team btw
<Daz> i wish it could RobotPinkie :(
<AllisZero> o.o
<User_3202> yesterday I found out MLP:FiM is produced in the city where I live
<RobotPinkie> yay Daz!
<Daz> YAY!
<Blueshade> excellent
<ValtheJean> but I will say that the pack from Target with all the different characters looks interesting
<Blums> you live in the phillipines 3202?
<Daz> buy eet ValtheJean
<RainBroDash> 10woohooo~
<User_3202> lol no canada
<ValtheJean> Can't find it
<Cracky> Aha, another one!
<Daz> too loud, RainBroDash xD
<ValtheJean> unfortunately they don't sell it online
<Blums> MLP FIM is animated in the phillipines and voiced in vancouver
<Blueshade> South Florida dude
<User_3202> Ah
<Daz> "[Grimdark][Shipping][Adventure][(Black)Comedy] "0_0
<papyruspony> ponied
<EdwardNewgate> 0Daz, everypony's in blackface
<RobotPinkie> also I've heard a LOT weirder conversations than hair styling discussion here.... :P
<JackiePie> Hi
<User_3202> they're also produced near the bad part of town
<Daz> ValtheJean be a hero and buy them in person, and not with autocheckout
<papyruspony> hello
<Daz> EdwardNewgate: :O
*ValtheJean is too scurred >.<
<Blueshade> HI
<Cracky> I can see it from where I live
<User_3202> like 3 blocks away from where crack dealers are
<rachel> i expect a lot of the primary animation is done in-house and they outsource stuff like background characters. hence derpy, lyra et al, so it works!
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<Daz> scurvy!
<User_3202> >_>
<User_3202> yeah almost all cartoons do that
<ValtheJean> Reverse trolling!
<HaysforPonies> So some guy in another country could have been responsible for Derpy XD
<Daz> hey ValtheJean dunno if you've heard my story of my 1st purchase but ... well, i left the shop, got in the car, and got out the car to go back in
<RobotPinkie> Subpoena is such a weird word... like how it's pronounced.
<Daz> also about 5 times in the shop i walked over to pink area, to MLP, and away again...
<rachel> HaysforPonies: and will probably never get the credit
<User_3202> Lol I dunno, I feel derpy was more of an inside job
<ValtheJean> lol
<Blueshade> Sonic Paradox is filled with bronies
<ValtheJean> did you end up retrieving the sacred artifacts?
<Blums> well all he did was screw up some eyes
<ValtheJean> lol
<Blums> the fandom created her personality
<papyruspony> this is true
<ValtheJean> dat soundboard sathi, dat soundboard :P
<EdwardNewgate> 0mfw
<VioletVanilla> LOL
<AllisZero> I want that soundboard!
<VioletVanilla> LOCO IN THE COCOA~
<HaysforPonies> Haha, a guy has a bad day and decides to draw Derpy with stupid eyes to give himself a laugh. Then it ends up being taken.
<RobotPinkie> I am definitely loco in the coco
<rachel> Blums: we reward enough other artists for serendipity
<AllisZero> I want it now
<Daz> I've only had an adrenaline rush (where it's not 'butterflies' but properly intense BZZZING through your body) a few times. a few horror games, themeparks, and sometimes at swimming competitions :3. but I had it there...when I saw the MLP toys...and saw myself in the pink aisle D:
<Daz> ValtheJean: it's an experience
<ValtheJean> lol
<User_3202> Still better than disgruntled artists at Disney :D
<ValtheJean> I'll bet
<Daz> twas horrible i was all 'wtfamidoing'
<papyruspony> i love the word serendipity
<RobotPinkie> AllisZero: http://kyrospawn.deviantart.com/art/MLP-FIM-Soundboard-alt-V5-2-244757196?
<HaysforPonies> Disgruntled artists with Marvel comics were beautiful.
<Daz> but then when i went into the car and got myself POWAH'D UP
<RobotPinkie> I THINK that's probably it...
<User_3202> disney bought marvel, they're friends now :P
<Daz> i ran back in, grabbed fluttershy, and stood there LIKE A BOSS genuinely, at the till, about 3 dads with kids looked at me, at my hand, and then ಠ_ಠ at me
<ValtheJean> ahahaha
<ValtheJean> I mean, sorry that happened. But god that must have been awkward
<Daz> i walked on, gave to man at till, who also ಠ_ಠ at me, and then gave him my 8 euros and walked out. Oh man, it's just ... an experience! go buy them ValtheJean !
<Daz> ValtheJean: to tell the truth it was awkward as fuck, but 2nd time in...i was BAWS.
<ValtheJean> lol...I dunno if I could
<Dermathil> Daz, I got no idea if a hair dryer is useful.
<papyruspony> you don't know that it might be a hostile takeover
<Daz> ok Dermathil i felt nothing. no shame
<RobotPinkie> It's very baws to buy ponies
<Daz> ("i felt nothing. no shame" was for ValtheJean )
<ValtheJean> lol, I'm too concerned about purchasing up in a very...very...odd state
<^Stargazer> miss all the good cartoons disney had in the 80's and 90's... heck even their real old stuff
<Daz> ikr RobotPinkie
<Dermathil> CALL THE DECONTAMINATION TEAM
<RobotPinkie> OH NOES
<papyruspony> i am in a state of agreement
<FreezeFrame> I would not feel shame in buying ponies, but that's because I just don't worry about that sort of thing.
<Daz> it's lupus. DO ho ho
<Dermathil> lawl
<RobotPinkie> THANKS FOR THE CANCER!
<Daz> FreezeFrame: so I thought. but then ... the pink aisle ... FIM ... Dat huge adrenaline rush ... D:
<AllisZero> RobotPinkie: Thank you!
<ValtheJean> Hey man, I literally JUST got to the phase of buying FiM t-shirts
<FallSilently> Okay, the bird is in bed, y'all can be cool again.
<ValtheJean> I'm not ready for in-person purchases yet :P
<Daz> no, AllisZero, thank /you/
*RainBroDash 10has no merch at all
<FreezeFrame> I don't buy much right now, though. No moneys.
<Blueshade> lol, this vid compares 3.5 rainbowdash with fim rainbowdash http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwyIR598a_s&feature=related
<Daz> RainBroDash needs to go and buy some.
<ValtheJean> RBD: :(. DO IT FILLY
<RobotPinkie> for the soundboard, or the cancer, AllisZero? :P
*Cracky realizes he actualy has direct LOS from his house to studio B

<ValtheJean> I BOUGHT ONLINE STUFFZ!
<User_3202> lol East Hastings?
<^Stargazer> rainbow dash always dressing in stlye... I found out where that reference came from finally lol
*ValtheJean is still pretty pissed off about the FiM dvd only having 2 episodes
<Cracky> from across the burrard inlet
<Daz> don't buy ponies online, go to a shop and pay for them face to face with the checkoutperson.
<RobotPinkie> I haven't gotten to the stage where I buy MLP shirts
<AllisZero> The soundboard haha
<RobotPinkie> because it's expensive to import :P
<User_3202> nice
*Daz awaits a 1080p release with extras and no watermarks. ONE CAN DREAM
<Sumica> What about a dvd
<ValtheJean> fair enough robotpinkie
<ForeverOdin> Gahh! It burns
<Daz> Sumica: there was a dvd with a set recently, but had only 2 episodes in it
<ValtheJean> Sumica: They released a dvd, but it only has 2 episodes on it
<ShadTheCrazed> THE G3.5! IT BURNS!

<User_3202> I was just in North Van yesterday :D
<EdwardNewgate> 0ohai mom and dad
<Blums> Scootaloo will show us games to play~
<Blueshade> Now a hilarious comparison with Pinkie Pie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y0w9g7CN1c&feature=related
<Roy> Yo could anyone explain me why the heck when i'm logged in my google account the chat doesn't work?
<Daz> GIIIIIIIIGAAAAAAAA. BRUUUUUUUUUUSH. IMPAAAAAAAAAAAALEEEEEEEEEE. http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110419021257/deadliestfiction/images/b/b8/G-L_-_Giga_Drill_Breaker.jpg
<HaysforPonies> As soon as I saw the video and G 3.5 Dash, a suddenly disgusting taste touched my tounge.
*Dermathil uses a very powerful magnet on the trident to disarm valthejean
<ValtheJean> awwww, I can't see the image :(
<firelight> firefly is the mother of rainbow dash ?
<Daz> aww...
<Sumica> Think I will wait on a box set, dont think I can work up the nerve to go buy 13 dvd's one at a time.
<Daz> aniways it's just 'giga drill breaker' from gurren lagann, an Anime
<Roy> nope.avi
<ValtheJean> The magnet is grafted onto my arms, it only serves to pull you into my killzone :P
<Sumica> it's R lee!
<ValtheJean> trident*
<ValtheJean> not magnet
<Daz> Sumica: it's a one off dvd in a toy set, there's not '2 eps per dvd'
<ValtheJean> ah
<Roy> Btw i'll burn your god damn house down WITH LEMONS!
<User_3202> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/548f7a52-9334-4593-9aeb-ac140b389390.gif
<Sumica> oh, it's a teaser
<Roy> alright anyone knows where can i find me some furries?
<AllisZero> Oh god the sky is falling outside my office
<Roy> gotta check something out ;)
<ValtheJean> yeah, I mean. I want to give Hasbro my money, but they've got to reach me half way
<ShadTheCrazed> Firefly was killed and her brain was taken out, improve, and put into Rainbow Dash
<AllisZero> So much rain
<ShadTheCrazed> *improved
<Daz> yea Sumica. it's all 'have toys, have dvds, watch us on Hub'
<Blueshade> along with her wings
<Roy> Rainbow Dash is basically Buttercup+Bloo
<Dermathil> sudenly, death
<Daz> ikr ValtheJean. now go buy ponies :3
<Sumica> what is rain?
<ValtheJean> lol
<Roy> and a little of sonic if you want to compare it to that
<Dermathil> the patient has deceased
<ValtheJean> I will say this much
<ValtheJean> if they made a Caramel toy
<Roy> oh and let's not forget her goofy personality
<Dermathil> I'm sure he died
<ValtheJean> shutupandtakemymoney.jpg
<Blueshade> sonic is probably RD's father for all we know
<User_3202> all ponies are goofy lol
<Roy> like damn that goofy persona when she first meets twilight or messes around with just guards
<Daz> is there a colgate toy?
<Sumica> it's 120 outside I wont see rain for a long time.
<Roy> just makes me wanna snuggle the crap out of her
<ValtheJean> there would not be a force on earth to prevent me from purchasing that Caramel
<Daz> 120 farenheit?

<Daz> MW2 is ridiculously overhpyed by little kids all overt he world. on the other hand, it is stupidly blindly hated because of this and seen as a horrible game. NO U says i! The campaign was explosive and awesome, and the multiplayer is hella fun! Dermathil, WHAT SAY YOU? http://mygeekblasphemy.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/10257aragorn4.jpg
<ValtheJean> I'm more fond of inb7, but that's just me :P

<RainBroDash> 10<4
<rachel> i'm not kidding, it really has lodged in my head
<Daz> ValtheJean: why is it hated then?
<ValtheJean> it's hated because it's just another shooter clone with nothing to add
<RobotPinkie> I'm more for inb1337
<EdwardNewgate> 0or rather
<Roy> I still like to think Luna was playing video games on the moon

<Roy> amen to that, brotha
<ShadTheCrazed> ^
<Daz> ah. well now ValtheJean it is indeed just another shooter, but it's fun IMO. but hey! that's like my opinion man ^_^
<Daz> as I said i really rarely play vidya
<User_3202> *brony
<^Stargazer> till we find out Discord is a human =O lol j/k
<rachel> is ok in some fan stuff, but yeah, should stay out of the show
<Daz> inb9 the 9 9
<Sketchy_Sounds> om nom nom
<^Stargazer> I didn't mind aspects about g1, like the drawing style was fine
<ValtheJean> fair enough
<Blueshade> Or that Celestia extinct humans
<AllisZero> I played the MW2 campaign once, skipped Black Ops
<ValtheJean> but I still hate it :P
<ForeverOdin> Bahahaha @ Twilight Sparkle saying to Celestia "Do you have ANY idea who you're [bucking] with?"
<AllisZero> Will play 3 for sure though
<User_3202> ???
<Blueshade> G1 was decent for girls but G3 is the worst
<Daz> blops was all 'WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN MASON' 'ALL MUST DIE' and 'FUCK MY HEAD'. that right there sums up blops ; )
<RobotPinkie> lol I haven't gotten MW2 yet
<RobotPinkie> too expensive
<ValtheJean> deh musickz....it calms me
<RobotPinkie> fucking activision...
<FreezeFrame> Okay, got more stupid orientation stuff, back at 8-ish
<FreezeFrame> (it's 5 here)
<RainBroDash> 10cya FF
<Daz> naw blops was a fun to play campaign too! only played it once though, but on veteran (I don't often play vidya, but when I do http://troll.me/images/the-most-interesting-man-in-the-world/i-dont-always-but-when-i-do.jpg It's on hardest possible settings)
<ValtheJean> see ya later freezeframe
<RobotPinkie> oh, bai FreezeFrame
<Dermathil> >yfw the EA-powered Origins has in its TOS a clause that allows EA to basically take any and all info about your computer, including what websites you visit, what stuff you download/install, and then can sell the info to 3rd-party providers. Also, you can only say no to that clause by not installing the program.
<Octavia> 14Ugh, now I'm so damn pissed off.
<Blueshade> I Want a Derpy, Bon Bon and Lyra Spinoff
<Dermathil> Now you tell me EA ain't a bunch of A-holes.
<Daz> y u Octavia ?
<RainBroDash> 10whats up octavia?
<RobotPinkie> I would never tell anyone that EA isn't a bunch of assholes...
*ValtheJean hugs Octavia
<ValtheJean> lol yeah, I think it's common knowledge that everyone hates EA
<AllisZero> EA has pretty much ruined any spontaneity in games
<Daz> ValtheJean, The hugs one! :3
<Octavia> 14Apprently my friends stupid mom cant wait 5 damn minutes for me to get back from the post office to give me a ride
<Blums> Pony sitcom?
<RainBroDash> 10D:
<ValtheJean> there is not a force on Earth more powerful than brony hugs!
<^Stargazer> CMC probably have the best chances of a spinoff
<Octavia> 14So now I have no damn ride to the store.
<RainBroDash> 10sux
<Dermathil> yeah, but now they will make it so that everybody who will play Battlefield 3 will see their privacy invaded even worse than even facebook could ever do.
<Blums> it would probably be more derpy and carrot top
<klaxa> eeyup
<Daz> Octavia: Run. I'm serious. Run.
<ValtheJean> @Octavia: :( I'm sorry to hear that
<RobotPinkie> aw
<Roy> So tell me, guys...Why are you naked?
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony that would gladly give Octavia a ride

<ValtheJean> I'd offer to drive you...but I neither live near you nor have a car :P
<Blueshade> We don't normally wear clothes
<Roy> alright here's the real question ;P
<Trixxy> Anyone play this pony game on deviantart yet?
<Octavia> 14I aint running 4-5 miles in no 100 degree heat
<Blueshade> What game
<Dermathil> the small kid is having ASTHMA
<ForeverOdin> Links?
<Trixxy> With Fluttershy and Rarity
<Daz> 100 degree what? farenheit?
<RobotPinkie> :(
<Roy> Who's chasing you o_O seriously...i've got like this owl staring into my soul for like 3 hours straight
<Dermathil> he's having a crysis

<RobotPinkie> lolol 100 degrees celsius would be boiling....
<AllisZero> >Dad gets cancer
<RainBroDash> 10daz it's not going to be 100 degrees C is it XD
<Dermathil> Also, the the biker
<Trixxy> Can't figure out how to do anything in the room
<Octavia> 14lol
<ShadTheCrazed> Roy: Owloysious exists IRL! He's trying to take you into Equestria!
<ValtheJean> lol, I love that they keep faking out
<ShadowMane> RainBroDash, it's only 212. You can handle that
<ShadTheCrazed> TAKE ME WITH YOU!
<Roy> Yo don't go all fanatic
*RainBroDash 10can handle anything
<ValtheJean> phfff, I live on the sun, you have no right to complain :P
<RainBroDash> 10because
<RainBroDash> 10he is
<Roy> i know you like to live the dream
<Daz> "100 degrees Fahrenheit = 37.7777778 degrees Celsius" Now, i'll have you know I run 8KM (8 kilometers = 4.97096954 miles) erry day at 1pm in spain - in 50 degrees celcius, (50 degrees Celsius = 122 degrees Fahrenheit) So it's possible. Do it Octavia >_<
*ShadTheCrazed takes a breath
<RobotPinkie> *brushie brushie*
<Octavia> 14Just so pissed she had to leave RIGHT when I was gone that whole 15 minutes
<Daz> DOSH! GRAB IT WHILE YOU CAN!
<ShadTheCrazed> Yeah, I bet nearly everone here wants to go to Equestria.
<Octavia> 14She couldnt go any other time, it HAD to be in that 15 minutes
<RinBarDosh> 10lol daz

<Cracky> ShadTheCrazed: I'd go with
<Daz> ShadowMane, orly? well, i've survived 5 months of it, and survived the worst (55 celcius is worst it got)
<Sonic_the_Brony> I would be a pony in equestria. But I would rather be a dragon
<Nuclear> !nuke
<Nuclear> ?
<Sumica> I would say try doing that runing in death vally but I recall spain is mostly desert too.
<RobotPinkie> wow, spain is hot
<ValtheJean> well, sorry to hear that Octavia :(, let me browse through my pony folder to cheer you up :P
<RobotPinkie> I remember going to Turkey in the summer
<RobotPinkie> 40 degrees in the shade
<User_3202> MLP ETFs Standing Tall
<RobotPinkie> lots of water was had
<Daz> RobotPinkie you betcha :P
<rachel> bit disappointed with the stargate equestria trailer. probably expecting and visualising too much :-}
<Daz> hmm ShadowMane what do you mean though about killing?
<RobotPinkie> and yeah we stayed in the shade as much as we could, then...
<ValtheJean> Derpy and Dinky always cheer me up! http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/130793898615.png
<ShadowMane> if the body's internal temperature reaches 105, your brain cells start dying

<RinBarDosh> 10PLAWT TWEEST
<FallSilently> The lack of new blood in the clips available is really starting to show.
<Roy> alright i'll change some other persona...cause this guy is dieing...and going back to sleep

<Daz> ShadowMane - During, and for like 20 mins after, i sweat that my whole top either gets LITERALLY soaking wet, or i take it off...i take it off ofc :P
<Daz> Dermathil: wat
<Dermathil> EEYUP
<ForeverOdin> Ha Ghost...

<Daz> but but y

<Daz> I dun wanna buy 'speshul edishan' for no reason >8^(
<Dermathil> Valthejean: they are pulling it out of their stores.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Those were some awesome chips
<Dermathil> They are not going to sell the game at all.
<DinkyTroll> I drew another mascot picture for a club at school.
<DinkyTroll> :P
<Daz> wat.
<RobotPinkie> wtf?
<Daz> so it's not 'sold out' but 'pulling oUt'???!?!?!?
<Dashite> What?
<rachel> it's actually impressed me that every time it seems people start saying, we've exhausted the material, someone manages to pull out something new from even the tiniest detail and turn it into something engaging
<Dashite> Last I heard they were only removing the OnLive codes from the boxes.
<RobotPinkie> So they're stealing from consumers, and when people point it out they stop selling the game completely?
<Sonic_the_Brony> Pony Spin! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2gwTWkjujQ
<Dermathil> yes Daz
<Dermathil> Dashite
<Daz> http://www.chilango.com/media/2011/02/09/wtf-indeed.jpg
<ValtheJean> that...ung...
<Dermathil> EEEEYUP
<ShadowMane> RobotPinkie, they aren't stealing at all, as they are removing from non-sold merchandise an item not included in the sale's price
<ShadowMane> but it's still a dick move
<Daz> RobotPinkie: teach me some swedish =D if you want
*ValtheJean hates the politics of capitalism
<ForeverOdin> Darn, expected Dead or Alive (the band). Still interesting
<ForeverOdin> Oh, there it is, in related links.
<Sonic_the_Brony> Twilight turned into a giraffe in this scene http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2SIgoDX4Q&feature=related
<Dermathil> Valthejean, would you prefer something worse?
<RobotPinkie> Yes, it is, ShadowMane. It's part of the package. I got a code to get Portal 2 on steam when I got Portal 2 for PS3, removing it is removing part of what I'm paying for.
<Dashite> ShadowMane, if it's put in the box by the publisher, it's part of the package.
<ValtheJean> no, I'd prefer something better
<SubtleStuff> Hey guys, how do i revive Einstein?
<Mongoose> Hey Pony Folk
<ForeverOdin> Hello Mongoose
<Sonic_the_Brony> put his brain in a robot
<RobotPinkie> lol what do you want to learn, Daz?
<Cracky> He returneth from the graveth!
<ShadowMane> The publisher is not the retailer. A store can purchase any product, alter it however they wish, and resell it altered as long as they give notice to customers that is has been altered
<Daz> eyedunnoh RobotPinkie :P
<ForeverOdin> Also, gogo gadget Extendo-Neck!
<Daz> hmm actually
<SubtleStuff> Michio Kaku or Albert Einstein?
<Dermathil> Valthejean, any suggestion for a better system?
<Sonic_the_Brony> LET"S DIG UP PONYVILLE AND PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE?
<Sumica> I dont think they toled people till some peopel called them on it.
<Dermathil> And by better I'm sure it rules Communism out.
<ValtheJean> yes, Valthejean as Supreme Overlord
<Sonic_the_Brony> wait wut
<Daz> how do I ask for beer, and what is the word for 'running' :P
<Daz> and what is 'pony'
<Daz> xD
<Daz> ValtheSupremeOverlord
<ForeverOdin> What's going on? >_<
<ShadowMane> True communism would be impressive to say the least, but humans will never accept such a political scheme
<Dermathil> Valthejean, Alright then. I'm going to send you all of my taxes and everything I buy. because the boss always has the biggest workload.
<FallSilently> That was probably Roy.

<ValtheJean> This calls for an impaling festival!
<Daz> ...sure
<RobotPinkie> They acknowledged it only after complaints were made, ShadowMane. Doesn't sound like they gave any notice.
<Dermathil> >yfw I find your personal informations and impersonate you.
<Daz> lawl
<ShadTheCrazed> JackiePie: We should just take anti-bronies, and PUSH them somewhere else!
<ValtheJean> hah, you wish you could impersonate me
<RobotPinkie> lol the word for "beer"... that's hard to pronounce
<ShadowMane> Was the coupon advertised on the package, Pinkie?
<User_3202> One day I'm talking with investment bankers and the next day I'm talking with bronies >_>
<Dashite> Gamestop is trying to throw their weight around and they can do it in this instance because Square Enix is small enough that they can do so.
<ValtheJean> I am an enigmatic cog in a far greater clock of mysteries
<JackiePie> How about that cliff over there?
<ShadTheCrazed> Sure!
<ShadowMane> >Square Enix
<ShadowMane> >Small

<Dashite> Comparatively.
<ShadowMane> perhaps
<Cracky> If I ever become quardraplegic like Hawking, I don't want microsoft sam as my voice, I want a pony soundboard

<Cracky> That's jsut something that had to be said...
<Cracky> Mayeb it shoudl go in my will?
<Sonic_the_Brony> JackiePie that Idea can get us all killed!

<Dashite> And Dermathil, Square Enix has recalled the product, so it's not Gamestop doing this on their own.
<JackiePie> Uhhh....*acts like Patrick getting hit by the confused ray*
<ShadTheCrazed> You know, I find Bronies a lot better than anti-bronies by doing some research. Wanna know why?
<FallSilently> Welcome back.
<JackiePie> Yes
<FallSilently> ponies.
<Retsamoreh> Because ponies.
<Retsamoreh> It's always because ponies.
<RobotPinkie> lol that's a very literal translation, Daz

<ShadTheCrazed> Bronies are a group that most of their kind will help support. Most of us are very friendly, unless otheriwse.
<RobotPinkie> "En öl, tack" would be correct
<Mongoose> I don't enjoy pennies
<ShadTheCrazed> *otherwise
<JackiePie> Yup
<Dashite> Also, "GameStop said this morning it does not want to promote its competitors. "We pulled the coupons because, like all retailers, we prefer not to promote our competitors and their competing offerings and services in our stores," Yet they still sell steamworks games. O.o
<JackiePie> It's how it should be

<RobotPinkie> but you'd probably say "en stor stark", Daz, meaning a big glass of "strong" beer.
<ShadTheCrazed> Anti-bronies are a group against ponies, but are not a group. Most of them won't support each other when it comes to hating ponies, and will moan at anything pony-related.
<ValtheJean> Tru fuggin dat Daz! Tru fuggin dat!
<Daz> ...strong beer? I like the sound of that :P
<User_3202> ?
<ValtheJean> NONE CAN ESCAPE THE WRATH OF THE IMPALER
<SummerRain> wow what losers.
<Cracky> I read moan as moon there
<JackiePie> What about people who like ponies, but behave in a anti-ponyish fashion?
*Daz is stroking, caressing, and BRUSHIEing ValtheJean's ego :P
<User_3202> nanaimo?
<Sonic_the_Brony> Even Adult Swim fears bronies
*ValtheJean 's ego is getting large
<Cracky> nanaimo???
<ShadTheCrazed> In short, my conclusion comes to that Anti-bronies are the complete opposite of Bronies.
<Cracky> what about nanaimo/
<Cracky> ?
<ValtheJean> wow...I just realized how that sounded
<Daz> oh god
<RobotPinkie> ...
<User_3202> Is RDN nanaimo?
<ShadTheCrazed> Nanaimo? ._.
*Sathi 7tames ValtheJean ego
<ValtheJean> okay, let me rephrase that...
<Cracky> uhh

<Daz> ValtheLegendary my personal fave i'd say
<SummerRain> Skeettchhyyy

<FallSilently> Shocking, isn't it?
<Daz> although ValtheImpaler is good

<ValtheImpaler> wait...how am I the impaler again?
<ForeverOdin> What ever floats their boat, I ersonally never got into it. o.o
<DracoDei> By my definition of "Furry", yes, every Brony is a Furry.

<SummerRain> dats me
<ValtheImpaler> lol, why is it always Mr Breezy with RBD?
<DracoDei> SummerRain: Alternatively, such characters themselves.
<SummerRain> sorta
<RobotPinkie> I think it's save to say ValtheImpaler wins this one...
<FallSilently> That's... not the definition of a furry.
<Daz> who's, um (almost afraid to ask), giving me undying love, RobotPinkie ?
<SummerRain> oh well.
<Sonic_the_Brony> Two types of ponyfans would explain everything http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbdupCmaGiM&feature=channel_video_title

<Xiagu> ypi cam
<firelight> i don't gonna read that -.-
<Xiagu> you can't change the world by changing definitions

<RobotPinkie> :(
<SummerRain> weeeeee
<RobotPinkie> I lost
<Daz> :(
<ValtheImpaler> Existence thinks, therefore he denies!
<Xiagu> defining ``furry'' differently will not change who considers themselves a furry and who doesn't
<ExistenceTheDenier> 3>House getting his rocks off
<ExistenceTheDenier> 3Lol
<ExistenceTheDenier> 3So true Val
<firelight> summer!!! =D
<SummerRain> huh?
<Daz> If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to deny it, does it exist?
<ValtheImpaler> :P
<DracoDei> SummerRain : I am NOT lecturing, I am DEFINING. [/Rarity+Twilight Hybrid]
<RobotPinkie> I deny your existence, and substitute my own!
<ExistenceTheDenier> 3Not at all.
<User_3202> how long has flankbook been offline?
<SummerRain> ohh this morning i did NOT like summer rain one bit
<ValtheImpaler> it turns out that everything is just like the angels
<ValtheImpaler> nothing exists without being observed :P
<ExistenceTheDenier> 3Also sorry Daz, you dont really exist either.
<Xiagu> User_3202, it's pretty iffy whether it's online or not
<SummerRain> DracoDei: i have no clue what you're talking about. yes i said it but i wasnt talking to you.
<User_3202> :(
<Daz> but ExistenceTheDenier if no one is around to deny it, they aren't denying an existenc eof something, there for there IS no existence of something, there for it doesn't exist :P
<Daz> (dat troll logic)
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony most likely to be brushie brushied by Daz
<SummerRain> i had to take the bus this morning to school
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony most likely to be brushie brushied by Daz is 15Sweetie 6Be13ll6e
<ValtheImpaler> he denies your trolling denial
<DracoDei> Xiagu: But it might serve as a preventitive measure to keep people from jumping to conclusions about what someone means when they use the term.
<SummerRain> so at the bus stop, at five in the morning
<Daz> ...I must go buy. RobotPinkie are there CMC near you?
<FallSilently> I love rain.
<SummerRain> its POUNDING down rain
<SummerRain> lightning and thunder
<RobotPinkie> Nope, unfortunately not yet
<Xiagu> DracoDei, only if people actually give a crap about your definition as opposed to what they've picked up in their heads
<FallSilently> Sounds fantastic. Really, I'd love that kind of weather.
<Daz> imma go as I said tomoro for RD, but 's far as i'm aware we only got the 2 sets you know. what u got? just mane 6 individually?
<SummerRain> and i didnt have an umbrella :/
<Daz> any more?
<ExistenceTheDenier> 3ValtheImpaler You talking Shrodinger here?
<ForeverOdin> Ever since I started school, the rain has stopped here. I miss it already. >_<
<SummerRain> i sat there and i got so soaked, i was still wet by the end of the day.
<RobotPinkie> yeah I just got the mane 6 individually thus far
<ForeverOdin> ...As it begins to thunder. O_O
<Xiagu> if we were going to have a long discussion, it would probably be worth saying what each person means when they use the word (without arguing over whose definition is `right')
<FallSilently> I despise umbrellas. As a tall person, I take my life into my very hands when it's raining in town.
<RobotPinkie> I'll get more though :P
<ValtheImpaler> eh, was kinda thinking that. But mostly because I can't get that damn Dr. Who episode out of my head :P:
<RobotPinkie> just not right now
<ExistenceTheDenier> 3>Obviously the bicycle police.
<SummerRain> yeah well it was unexpected
<Daz> RobotPinkie: i don't even have 4 of the 6 :( I NEED TWI
<Cracky> so User_3202, you checked otu the group?

<Cracky> umbrellas are cool
<RobotPinkie> oh alliszero
<ShadowMane> Twilight Sparkle... is a fritter?

<Daz> O U house
<SummerRain> thats the only thing i didnt like about the storm
<Sonic_the_Brony> Peter Parker went to a research facility to take pictures until A RADIO ACTIVE PINKIE PIKE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND BIT PETER PARKER BY THE BUTT. Thus giving him new super pony powers, thus becoming PONYMAN.

<Ghosties> 4Well, here I am!! : D
<SummerRain> i'd love to play the drums
<Leonon> Cajun accent? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwbUCI9bEvA
<Pyroh> Russian accents sound kick ass
<Cracky> My accent is not russian
*ShadowMane wanted more blue
<Cracky> though I am part Russian
<Cracky> my accent bears no trace of it
<Denied_Existence> 3Sorry, I dont remember asking for blood...
*EdwardNewgate wants more green
<Sumica> Oh god, the color it burns my eyes
<ValtheImpaler> okay...having trouble finding my flashdrive. I *promise* you I will email you the progress sathi
<Pyroh> LOL try talking to a cape islander like myself
<Denied_Existence> 3Mabye it was on my shopping list?
<Happy_Mask_Salespony> You've met with a terrible accent haven't you?
<ValtheImpaler> also ohai ghosties
<Pyroh> We have so many slangs
<Dermathil> LOL
<Pyroh> its ridiculous
<RainBroDash> 10oh god, Ghosties is here
<Marshmelon> Cracky: was that a pun?
<Daz> Hey Ghosties will you be at LOTR marathon?
<RainBroDash> 10I mean HAI GHOSTIES
<SummerRain> TGIF tomorrow. DX school really does bum me out and scare me.
<RobotPinkie> ohey Ghosties
<ShadowMane> Oh you, Ghosties
<Ghosties> 4I hope, Daz
<Marshmelon> 15:46 Cracky: My accent BEARS no trace of it
<Ghosties> 4But, you know, there's a hurricane close to my position
<Cracky> Marshmelon: Are you saying i have a BEAR accent?!
<Pyroh> You know what we say here instead of yes?
<SummerRain> one of the teachers i am terrified of. i fear her and heck yeah show respect to her
<Pyroh> Eyah!
<RobotPinkie> @pony Ghosties' soul mate
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Ghosties' soul mate is 6R12A3I9N8B7O4W 11DASH
<RainBroDash> 10lolwut
<Ghosties> 4Annnnnnnd, I dunno if the cable will hold up
<Daz> : / and rainbrodash trolled you with it with Steven_Magnet :(
<EdwardNewgate> OHSI-
<Pyroh> Try to sound that out to the best of your abilities
<Cracky> I sound nothing like a bear!
<RobotPinkie> aw
<Ghosties> 4But I'm fine with my soul mate being Rainbow Dash
<Happy_Mask_Salespony> ROAR
<SummerRain> i say Eeyup. Big Mac would've wanted that.
<Ghosties> 4After AJ, she's my choice
<RainBroDash> 10eww
<Happy_Mask_Salespony> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYUUUP
<RainBroDash> 10AJ
<EdwardNewgate> Oh another brony who likes AJ
<RainBroDash> 10why would you do that
<Cracky> I always say Eyup, always have...
<Pyroh> No, its ALOT thicker than Eyup
<EdwardNewgate> We must be 1 in a million
<Ziltoid> inb4 mod war
<RobotPinkie> AJ is awesome, stfu hater :P
<RainBroDash> 10another misguided brony*
<Pyroh> Like 10 times more hard to understand
<Cracky> with just one E though
<Ghosties> 4AJ is down to earth, practical, sensible, honorable.
<Daz> yay AJ
<Pyroh> And we call rope, Popaleen
<Happy_Mask_Salespony> Try to talk western with that voice bro
<Ziltoid> dude
<Pyroh> For some reason :/
<Denied_Existence> 3Sorry, not an AJ fan...the accent doesnt really register as interesting when you hear an accent all the time
<Daz> "Faithful and Strong" too, Ghosties
<Ghosties> 4I do too, DE
<Cracky> My accent is entirely unique
<Denied_Existence> 3And all those other traits I see daily
<Ghosties> 4I live in Southeaster NC, remember?
<Marshmelon> To bears
<Mongoose> My accent is "normal"
<Ghosties> 4So, the accent is everywhere
<Mongoose> which no accent really is
<Daz> Wat. ok um AJ is awesome, got that? :P
<Denied_Existence> 3(Also, I am the element of loyalty myself so....)
<Pyroh> There is no such thing as Normal
<Pyroh> To anything
<Cracky> The first question nearly everyone asks me is "WHere are you from"
<Mongoose> yep
<firelight> i don't have accent ... i think
<Cracky> when meeting me in person
<RainBroDash> 10eww what is with this love for AJ
<Marshmelon> I had a good standard, eastern coast, announcer, non-accent, very perfect speech
<Ghosties> 4But still, AJ would be my first choice for qualities in a wife
*SummerRain glomps HotCocoa
<RobotPinkie> You see this? This... is my PONY! YOU GOT THAT?
<Cracky> THe only exception I can think of is "WHat's your favourite pony?"
*HotCocoa is glomp'd, snuggles SummerRain
<Denied_Existence> 3.......
<SummerRain> you le-left me alone, is this cold, harsh world..
<Ghosties> 4Then it'd be a tie between Twilight/Rainbow Dash
<Marshmelon> Now I'm gaininga southen/cowboy
*SummerRain shivers and rolls into a ball
<Ghosties> 4Rarity would honestly be last
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Ziltoid> cone
<Ghosties> 4Fluttershy would be high up, though
<Daz> AJ: here and RD are like the 2 fittest ponies (and i guess maybe big mac? cuz of farm?) but yea she's sporty, my kinda girl. honest, so won't lie to you in a relationship, so stronger relationship. Hard working / knows pain (g2 get up earli for work / lives off farm). C'mon AJ isa wesome pony!
<Pyroh> Ah teeya son
<EdwardNewgate> Spitfire is best wife
<Ghosties> 4Maybe make Twi/Dash a triple thread

<Ghosties> 4I mad?
<RainBroDash> 10that was so funny
<Mongoose> She's here with me right now
<RainBroDash> 10the translation tool was literally godlike
<Ghosties> 4I was actually joking about the "hating" part
<Mongoose> I'm letting her watch....
<Mongoose> whatever it is she likes

<Ghosties> 4Trixie?
<Colgate> Cracky: I do must of my coding in C, so I don't have fancy nullable types -.-
<RobotPinkie> Wow
<ValtheImpaler> Sit down on this sofa Ghosties. Why don't you take a seat? Tell me about these anger issues you've been having :P
<Ghosties> 4Loving someone other than herself?
<Cracky> Colgate: Of course you do!
<Denied_Existence> 3Bleh
<Cracky> jsut return 0
<RobotPinkie> That's quite a get, Ghosties
<Colgate> that is my false
<Sumica> Oh now Val is trying to be Sigmund.
<Cracky> it's also null!
<ValtheImpaler> Dah! If I vere Sigmoond I vould be tawlking vith zee accent!
<Ghosties> 4Nurse, I think Dashite has split personality disorder too. Give him a strong does of an anesthetic to calm his jittery mind
<RainBroDash> 10>strong does
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<Ghosties> 4Nurse, I believe mein spelling is off today
<Dashite> Wait what?!
<Dashite> What did I do?
<Colgate> well, I did think of a way it would work but... it is kind of messy
<Dermathil> But wouldn't that require a psychological follow-up instead, doctor Ghosties?
<Dashite> I haven't don't anything!
<ValtheImpaler> Hmmmmmmm Ghosties. I Zink I zee seh prowblem here. I believe zis is caused by your love of ein mozher!
<Dashite> I'm innocent!
<Cracky> just use an enum
<Colgate> well, that's the smart way
<Marshmelon> Computer genders?
<Cracky> or a pointer to a bool
<Colgate> I'm talking ridiculous work arounds
<Ghosties> 4Indeed it would, Dermathil. *slaps on latex gloves* That's why it calls for a more...thorough exam
<Sumica> Time for some frontier psychology
<Cracky> lol, bool pointers
<ValtheImpaler> dat mouse is cute
<Marshmelon> Pokey Pierce, an attractive colt.
<Cracky> or a struct
<Ziltoid> inb4 dead rat
<Dermathil> (>mfw House was godly that moment)
<Dermathil> DAT HEAD
<Ziltoid> DAT HEADA TITL
<Cracky> I hate programming without templates/generics
<Colgate> well, bool wasn't in C until C99, so you can't rely on it to be in every compiler, although nearly every one has it now
<Denied_Existence> 3OH GOD GHOSTIES
<Cracky> ok, char then
<Cracky> same difference
<RainBroDash> 10I love this guy
<Cracky> a pointer to a single char. :P
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Dermathil> Just let that idiot die already. He obviously wants to die very, very young.
<Dermathil> The patient is all yours then, doctor Ghosties.

<Dermathil> SUDDENLY
<Ghosties> 4SHE'S GOT THE HIVS NOW
<Sumica> thanks ass
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<Colgate> well yeah, then change the value to 0/1 for M/F, or null the pointer if other, but that leaves a small memory leak
<ValtheImpaler> "This is the last time I help an HIV patient"
<Cracky> or get abusive with preprocessor metaprogramming
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony that now has HIV
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that now has HIV is 7G5ild15a
<RobotPinkie> I'm okay with that.
<Dermathil> THe patient is now to be banned from the hospital for being a big fucker.
<ValtheImpaler> @pony the pony Gilda got it from
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony Gilda got it from is 8Bo12nB13on
<rachel> if you need more than two values then bool is wrong
<Ghosties> 4Seriously, that's one of the reasons why I would NEVER work with HIV patients
<Cracky> I'm not sure how, but i'm sure there's something you can do
<Colgate> rachel: yes, we know
<Pyroh> Uhhhhhhhh
<Cracky> abusing the C/C++ preprocessor is my favourite
<rachel> well, what's with even debating it?
<Sumica> I totaly saw that CSI where the dude killed a chick with hiv and the spray got em in the face.
<Pyroh> I hate fish!
<Pyroh> Stupid mother......
<RobotPinkie> Yeah it seems kinda scary like that...
<Colgate> we're just being nerdy and thinking of stupid things we could do
<Dermathil> >yfw I met someone with SIDA. Didn't touch him but he made a pretty good speech
<ValtheImpaler> We're not just sure
<ValtheImpaler> we're HIV+
<RobotPinkie> Just talking to, hugging etc. someone who has HIV isn't a problem.
<Dermathil> eeeyup RobotPinkie.
<RobotPinkie> However standing close to someone with HIV who is coughing up blood....
<RobotPinkie> I wouldn't want to do that, no :P
<Cracky> I can never remember exactly waht you don't have in C that you do have in C++ though...
<Ziltoid> no pills here
<Ziltoid> pills here
<ValtheImpaler> grabbin pills
<Colgate> a lot of stuff -.-
<Sketchy_Sounds> Any semblance of an idea of what's happening.

*RobotPinkie hugs Apple Bumpkin
<HaysforPonies> Fluttershy.

<rachel> fluttershy
<Cracky> Does the fluttershy say "Yay" ?
<Marshmelon> (I can't figure out how I should have phrased that, so Just did the best I could)
<Marshmelon> No
<rachel> it must say yay
<Marshmelon> Just standard plushies.
<Barry> Let's play Operation: Bricks edition! Where you're bricked every time you touch the sides
<rachel> hm
<rachel> still fluttershy
<Sumica> For extra fun operation use a carbattery instead of the normal battery.
<Cracky> Does the rarity say "Wahaha!"
<Marshmelon> You can rip her open and stuff a soundbox in her
<Marshmelon> Lol, no
<Barry> that reminds me of a sick episode of 1000 ways to die
<Colgate> Fluttershy
<Cracky> Rip open Fluttershy?!!??! YOU MONSTER!
<Sumica> that the battery fishing one?
<Barry> A guy set up a cow's heart to a car battery just so he could... you know
<HaysforPonies> I don't think I could cut open Fluttershy. Wouldn't have the heart.
<RobotPinkie> ORLY NAO?
<ValtheImpaler> ubercharge?
<Mongoose> I would kill a man for the Fluttershy plushie
<Sumica> lol
<Barry> needless to say, he died
<Mongoose> Seriously, I would pull a man's heart out for it.
<Denied_Existence> 3No ValtheImpaler MOOOBERCHARGE
<Blums> fluttershy?

<Blums> http://askpinkaminadianepie.tumblr.com/post/9382370603
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about HEY, WHO POSTED PONIES?
<ValtheImpaler> that wins :P
<Cracky> What if the man's heart... WAS the fluttershy plushie!
<HaysforPonies> Hahahaha.
<Barry> And then there was one where this guy had a meteor shoot through him
<Sumica> thought you were talking of the guy that tryed fishing by throwing a truck battery in to the lake wile in a metal fishing boat.
<Mongoose> then I would keep it
<Cracky> I wish my heart was fluttershy
<Marshmelon> Would you buy a Rarity, if it weren't a contest between the two?
<Cracky> Best... Organ... EVER!
<HaysforPonies> I know the person that does the AskPinkamina. Very strange person.
<Denied_Existence> 3Small lake

<Cracky> use CamelCase
<Cracky> the solutiopn to all of life's problems
<Marshmelon> You can ... yeah. Wait, what? What's "camel case?"
<RobotPinkie> It's just some Google Fu :P
<DesertRose> anyone find themselves being ripped off when you finaly realise that manufactures of memory storage units measure, as an example: 1 gigabyte as 1,000,000,000 bytes
<ValtheImpaler> that rhymes with ponibooru!
<Mongoose> Did I guess right johnsey?
<Cracky> CamelCase: ThePenIsMightierThanTheSword
<Shosties> 4D:
<johnsey> all wrong :) thought you'd look at my hostname

<Mongoose> I'm going to try to keep this PG as possible
<RobotPinkie> I don't think either of those was on ponibooru, ValtheImpaler

<Marshmelon> "Applejack... Apple?"
<DesertRose> for every gigabyte of memory advertised your losing 73.7 megabytes
<ValtheImpaler> Oh I know robotpinkie, I was just pointing out a random rhyme :P
<Shosties> 4robotpimkie. WHAT DID YOU SEARCH
<RobotPinkie> aw this was last House ep?
<Mongoose> Use your tea bag to keep my tea cup full with tea, and lick your lolipop because I enjoy candy.

<Dermathil> waitwut^
<Cletus> is everybody here from europe?
<Cracky> anwyays, technicaly a gigabye is 1,000,000,000 bytes :p

<ValtheImpaler> does anyone else think Hasbro needs to have Pinkie's VA sing that song?
<Marshmelon> Pen: Change your name to "MightyPen"
<ValtheImpaler> because mfw Pinkie becomes to new Rick Roll

<Ziltoid> what song?
<ValtheImpaler> Ziltoid: Denied_Existence's link

<RobotPinkie> you might have to scroll down a couple of pages to find some images, Shosties
<the_pen_is_mightier> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, the_pen_is_mightier!
<Cracky> and we are supposed to use the term that sounds like a bad lisp: "gibibyte", to refer to 10737341824 bytes
<Ziltoid> eeeeee=nope
<DesertRose> technacly yes
<johnsey> yay SI units
<Cletus> If you type !moon, do you get kicked?
<Colgate> not always
<johnsey> Cletus: try it? :)
<Marshmelon> Derpy: She's so commanding
<Cracky> but, realisticaly...
<Marshmelon> Dominating, even.
<Cracky> 902 bytes in a kilobyte
<Cletus> two people did it?
<Mongoose> Lose yourself in the coma of the way you lie because you'll be in the pursuit of happiness and hail mary
<Cletus> and they got kicked
<Ziltoid> wut
<johnsey> that's a pretty low sample size

<JackiePie> The end
<DesertRose> because its anoying when an advertised 8 gig memory stick is actualy 7.45 gigs
<johnsey> you can't draw any conclusions from that
<Mongoose> I am a rapper
<johnsey> here, check this out

<firelight> that was necessary ? -.-
<Marshmelon> firelight, you still around?
<Colgate> dat plot
<Elky> the rainbows make me cry
<Marshmelon> Oh, I guess so
<Octavia> johnsey is always neccessary
<firelight> yes
<johnsey> i'd try that a few more times for higher confidence!
<Marshmelon> (mod abuse...)
<Cracky> firelight: You were UNNECESSARY!

<Marshmelon> Are you registered?
<Ghosties> 4She's giving her battle cry
<GGgala> she done got the diabeetus

<ValtheImpaler> probably that dad's convertible :P
<Colgate> /nickserv info fireligh
<Dermathil> Dat wasn't a battle cry. That was someone crying for their mummy!

<Marshmelon> baw.
<Marshmelon> do I have to?
<DesertRose> i could realisticly sue the company i just bought my new HDD from for 6.86% of the costs for the hard drive
<Dermathil> A Battle cry sounds like dis: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
<NightCat> 7So Pete & Pete anything else?
<ShadTheCrazed> Guys, try to say you watch the show for the deep, big plot.
<ShadTheCrazed> *oh ho ho
<Colgate> GL with that Desert, I'm sure it has been tried before
<DesertRose> !link plot
<Marshmelon> DesertRose: did they sell it to you advertising it as 1000000000000000(etc) bytes?
<Octavia> a simple /whois will show registration

<Marshmelon> +1
<Marshmelon> Omg yes
<Ziltoid> we talking cartoons?
<Marshmelon> Anyway
<Elky> anyone read the life and times of scrooge mcduck?
<DesertRose> advertised in gigabytes, when memory is measured in multiples of 1024, not 1000. i could actualy win a lawsuit
<Marshmelon> Why did firelight quit...?
<RobotPinkie> I'll probably go to bed after this episode, though. :(
<Razyn> We not talking. We typing.
*BitZero facehoofs
<Colgate> well, I wish you luck Desert
<Ziltoid> well
<Ziltoid> semantics
<Ghosties> 4Hell yeah, Pete & Pete! : D
<Lets_Scootabuse> D:
<DesertRose> but why would anyone even try
<Marshmelon> Desert: doesn't that mean you got MORE bytes?
<Razyn> Ziltoid, I love arguing about them
<ValtheImpaler> well, I'm always fond of Invader Zim :P
<BlacklightShining> who came up with the storage-measured-in-powers-of-ten stuff anyway?
<Marshmelon> HOLY SHIT
<DesertRose> no-one did
<Marshmelon> A little bird just flew down and landed on my laptop screen
<Marshmelon> I thought it was a moth at first.
<Shosties> 4RobotPinkie I was afk moving to my bedroom from the lounge
<Colgate> HDD manufactures probably
<Sharksky> Marshmellon: Wat.
<JackiePie> It probably wants to tweet
<Marshmelon> Yeah
<Shosties> 4also I do already have that pic
<Shosties> 4:3
<Sharksky> Hehehe.
<ShadTheCrazed> Marshmelon: IT'S FLUTTERSHY'S MESSAGE SAYING SA PORTAL TO EQUESTRIA HAS OPENED!
<Marshmelon> @Sharksky, I mean, "Yeah"
<RobotPinkie> Aw, I'm not awesome, then :(
<ShadTheCrazed> *saying a
<Marshmelon> Sheesh, JakiePie
<JackiePie> What?
<DesertRose> memory is measured in the powers of 2
<Ziltoid> Animaniacs
<ShadTheCrazed> Take me with yoooooou!
<NightCat> 7Cartoons & series
<DesertRose> not ten
<BlacklightShining> ^
<BlacklightShining> 2^ *
<NightCat> 7everyhing is welcome
<Sharksky> 3^
<Cletus> !neptune
<JackiePie> Sorry for making a joke?
<Sharksky> 4^!
<BlacklightShining> but DesertRose, who came up with that?
<Marshmelon> Shad: I wish. Except I squealed and hte dog chased it awat
<Colgate> 2^x
<Marshmelon> *away
<DesertRose> the greeks?
<Marshmelon> Actuallyt
<Shosties> 4also Robotpinkie I'm going to bed after this ep too I think
<Marshmelon> I'm going to pursue it.,
<BlacklightShining> *facehoof*
<Marshmelon> bbNever
<Elky> >not staying up until 3 am every day to watch cartoons
<Elky> >in 2011
<BitZero> Considering how bytes work, it makes sense for it to be a power of two.
<DesertRose> the greeks were the first to use number systems in multiples of two's because it was the simplest
<BlacklightShining> who came up with this crap idea that storage should be measured in powers of ten?!
<RobotPinkie> lol
*RobotPinkie hugs Luna
*Luna 7likes to be hugged
<ValtheImpaler> wooooooooona
<DesertRose> marketers
<ShadTheCrazed> Hmm... I think I just heard voices coming from outside. Sounds like... a portal!
<RobotPinkie> It's the law
*ValtheImpaler hugs Luna
*Razyn 0hugs Luna~
<BlacklightShining> ^5 exactly
*johnsey bytes BitZero
<BlacklightShining> oh, wow
<ValtheImpaler> FOR THE LUNAR REPUBLIC!
<DesertRose> and technacly its not, its just marketed that way
<BlacklightShining> just so they can make more money, huh?
<Cracky> I prefer powers of 16
<BitZero> Ouch.
<Shosties> 4elky I'm suffering from allergy symptoms, meh
*ShadTheCrazed looks outside. "HOLY CRAP! A PORTAL! Something seems to be coming out of it..."
<Elky> oh, what're you allergic to?
<DesertRose> powers of 16 is also found uder the powers of 2
<Shosties> 4It'll be hard enough to keep up with my exercise regime, I wanna do that then pass out asleep
<Elky> fun?
<BlacklightShining> but 1,024 isn't a power of 16
<Shosties> 4I'm allergic to cats
<ValtheImpaler> he's allergic to love
<ValtheImpaler> QUICK, LOVE HIM
<DesertRose> the base power is 2
<RobotPinkie> I'm allergic to grass pollen
<Shosties> 4XD
*ValtheImpaler hugs Shosties
<Elky> me too, but only very slightly
*Shosties 4oh noes! I'm dying!
<Marshmelon> It's gone
<Colgate> BlacklightShining: I think he meant all powers of 16 are also powers of 2
<ValtheImpaler> awwwww....no kitties?
<Cracky> Who cares about 1024
<Marshmelon> I feel sick now
<ValtheImpaler> but I wub deh kittehs!
<Cracky> people only think it's important becasue it's clkose to a power of 2
<Cracky> er
<Cracky> 10
<Luna> 7me too
<BlacklightShining> Cracky: 1,024 is important
<Cracky> 1024 is IRRELEVANT!
*ValtheImpaler misses his cat
<BitZero> 2056 is where it's at.
<BlacklightShining> no it's not!
<Marshmelon> Like
<Elky> me too, which is why I put up with the itching eyes and nose
<Razyn> 0Kittens are awesome!
<Marshmelon> Like I just missed my chance
<Luna> 11Cats are awesome
<Luna> 11I fixed that for you
<DesertRose> we use 1024 because it has the higest common divisibale power/thing
*Luna 11purrs
<BlacklightShining> because each _byte is 1,024 times the next lower _byte
<BlacklightShining> i.e., 1 TB = 1,024 GB; 1 GB = 1,024 MB; etc.
<Marshmelon> Horribly crushing. Also, my stomach in squeezing.
<Colgate> 8 is the only number that matters!
<BlacklightShining> 9.9
<Marshmelon> Just awful.
<Ghosties> 4Whoa
<Elky> silly Luna, you're not a cat!
<Razyn> 0...HNNNNNGH
<Colgate> because that is the minimum addressable size
<DesertRose> you can divide 1024 by 2 right down to 1 perfectly
<Ghosties> 4Sath is using Silver's color
<Marshmelon> Colgate: tell that to Cirno (9)
<Cracky> That is purely a cultural connotation
<ValtheImpaler> dun dun duunnnnnn
<Cracky> colgate is right
<Cracky> yes
<Luna> 11Eeeeeyup
<Cletus> I never liked Cirno
<RobotPinkie> Luna can be anything she likes
<BlacklightShining> DesertRose: same with any power of two
*Luna 11nods in agreement
<Colgate> cirno?
<Cracky> DesertRose: that happens eithe every pwoer of 2
<Marshmelon> I never played... um, that game
<DesertRose> yup.
<Ziltoid> >give you up
<RobotPinkie> >let you down
<Shosties> 4Elky my allergies are quite bad, and I also have asthma. So when I come to my dad's house (2 cats) I get symptoms like itchiness everywhere and pain in my teeth, with the standard cold symptoms too. I can hardly breathe when I'm here, and it takes me like a week to recover when I get home too >.>
<Luna> 11NEVER
<ValtheImpaler> :( Shosties
<Elky> ugh, that's rough
<Colgate> who is cirno?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Cracky> 4 398 046 511 104
*ValtheImpaler hugs Shosties again
<RobotPinkie> Ouch, Shosties
<ShadTheCrazed> I don't care what anypony says: Row Row fight the powah would best fit as Pinkie Pie's theme.
<Marshmelon> So
<Razyn> 0Shosties... Sad story bro...
<Elky> do you react allergically to other pets too?
<DesertRose> thats why we use bytes in the form of the powers of 2 and not 10.
<Denied_Existence> 3>Green penis
<DesertRose> its easyter to divide
<Shosties> 4nope, i have a dog too :D
<Cracky> yes
<Shosties> 4I love my dog so much
<Cracky> but we youse it in multiple ten powers of two
<BlacklightShining> wow, Cracky!
<Elky> at least you can have that
*Shosties 4misses his dog when he's at his dog :P
<BlacklightShining> hang on a sec
<Colgate> because powers of 2 are incredibly easy to work with on computers :D
<Marshmelon> Um
<Shosties> 4>at his dog. At his dad's*
<Elky> even though cats are way better :P
<Shosties> 4dogs > cats
<Marshmelon> ShadtheCrazed, you were making that up, right?
<Luna> 11CATS > DOGS
<DesertRose> 2^10 = 1024
<Shosties> 4my dog > cats
<RobotPinkie> cogs > dats
<Cracky> becasue multiple ten powers of two fit nicely within our preconcived notions of the importance of ten
<Shosties> 4my dog > all cats
<Ziltoid> MOPE
<Ghosties> 4Um
<Elky> pirate cats > ninja dogs
<Marshmelon> With my whole bird scenario?
<Ghosties> 4Dogs>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Cats
<Ghosties> 4times infinity plus 2

<Shosties> 4ikr.
<Trixxy> till pony
<BlacklightShining> 4398046511104 = 2^42
<BlacklightShining> whew!
<ShadTheCrazed> I'll have to do a ddeper investigation!
<Octavia> equestrian math, it is so magical, base on hooves, powers on top o/~
<Shosties> 10I'll get pics of him when he comes and huggles me when I get home
<Elky> that dog is all like 'Somebody fetch me a nipple'
<Sharksky> 2 to the Power of Trixie = Great and Powerful Trixie.
*Octavia fails at making a funny.
<Sharksky> That is how I see math now.
<RobotPinkie> Thanks
<johnsey> haha
<ShadTheCrazed> Well, portal closed, but I did see a hoof stick out before it closed.
<RobotPinkie> now I'm not as confused anymore
<BlacklightShining> lol
<BlacklightShining> …!
<ShadTheCrazed> Darn it, I thought I found something good.

<ShadTheCrazed> Gonna eat dinner. Gonna do more investigations laters.
<RobotPinkie> bai Denied_Existence
<Elky> BUT WHY
<RainBroDash> 10cya D_E
*BlacklightShining is sad because the portal apparently doesn't do conversions
<DesertRose> still getting ripped off every time we buy a memory module or something
<Elky> bye
<Ghosties> 4Red spy? Me? Never :3
<ValtheImpaler> later denied!
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> see ya
<RainBroDash> 10oh u :3
<BlacklightShining> …at least not going FROM Equestria
<Cracky> Octavia: Prime marks represent now add the series up!
<Colgate> pretty sure memory is sold in powers of 2
<BlacklightShining> there's a very small chance that it might still do so going TO Equestria
<DesertRose> nah
<BlacklightShining> Colgate: now always
*johnsey shifts BitZero to the right
<Cracky> no
<BlacklightShining> I've seen 500 and 750 GB hard disks
<Colgate> that is hard drive space... not memory
<BlacklightShining> oh
<DesertRose> a marketed 8GB USB drive is actualy 7.45GB
<BlacklightShining> rihg
*BitZero shifts himself to the left
<BlacklightShining> t
<Colgate> memory = RAM
<BlacklightShining> DesertRose: nope
<johnsey> BitZero: I think you're missing some bits there
<BlacklightShining> it's 8 GB BUT
<Colgate> bitzero is now a power of 2 larger!
<Cracky> it's sold in powers of 1.9952
<Colgate> unless he overflowed
<Colgate> then he is smaller!
<VioletVanilla> Oh RainBroDash ;3
<BitZero> It's quite fine, johnsey.
<DesertRose> its not 8GB, its 8 billion bytes
<BlacklightShining> when you format it, some —NO!
<BlacklightShining> —space is reserved for…uh…
<DesertRose> no its not
<BlacklightShining> I'm not sure what exactly
<Colgate> I was surprised how much space an ext4 file system took
<Cracky> BlacklightShining: nope
<Plorf> I love this
<Plorf> http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss143/Plorf/learningismagic.png
<Cracky> that's 'cause it's ext4
<BlacklightShining> DesertRose: 8 GB = 8,192 MB
<DesertRose> the rest of the memory you thought you bought never existed
<RobotPinkie> owowowow
<BlacklightShining> …what
<RobotPinkie> It's painful watching House sometimes
<Octavia> sandisk is terrible about hiding things on their usb drives
<Colgate> cat /proc/meminfo
<johnsey> damnit i just accidentially stuck a hoof in my eye
<Marshmelon> Whose?
<Colgate> nope, definitely power of 2 for memory
<Elky> mistakes are SRS BSNS
<Marshmelon> Whose hoof?
<LightDasher> Wouldn't that hurt more than a finger?
<Colgate> at least my RAM is -.-
<johnsey> mine
<Cracky> Cross my heart and hope to fry, stick a DIMM slot in my eye!
<Marshmelon> I'd even be okay as a human in Equestria.
<DesertRose> 8GB = 8192MB, 8 Billion Bytes = 7.45GB, my 8GB drive, stated by my PC, has a 7.45GB capacity
<BlacklightShining> I wouldn't
<Colgate> a DIMM slot eh? ripping it off of your mother board? -.-
<Marshmelon> It can be done
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
*Mongoose gnaws on johnsey's hoof

<johnsey> Mongoose: oh i'm not sure you want to do that, considering where it was before my eye...
<Marshmelon> Sounds like Fluttershy...
<Marshmelon> The yes.
<johnsey> actually
<johnsey> nevermind
<RainBroDash> 10so good XD
<BlacklightShining> DesertRose?
<Marshmelon> "Actually...

<RainBroDash> 10XD
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<GumballCrash> mmm ext4
<Marshmelon> Mongoose: Guessing game!?
<johnsey> Mongoose: you will say yes
<Colgate> not sure on the actual size of the drive, since it isn't my drive and I no longer have it -.-
<Marshmelon> Is it, "OHM NOM NOM"!?
<MrPoniator> You never get exactly what you're being advertized
<Marshmelon> MrPoniator: that's why you su.
<Mongoose> "That makes me want to gnaw it even more"
<Marshmelon> *sue
<Mongoose> and what not
<DesertRose> ok, my "250gb" hard drive laptop; 250 million bytes, or about 238GB in true capacity, including whats being used by the file system
<Cracky> Most of the time filesystem space is included in the size of files, at least on NTFS
<BlacklightShining> …oh
<Colgate> Cracky: it is for me too
<johnsey> Mongoose: actually i was slicing chilis
<redd> Fluffywufs
<Mongoose> Oh
<Mongoose> I enhoy chilis
<redd> whatcha up to
<Mongoose> I also enjoy them
<MrPoniator> It's just "cooler" to advertize with the capacity rounded up
<Octavia> 14Yayy~
<BlacklightShining> …wow, seriously?
<Colgate> I should get another HDD now that I think about it, this one is getting full :/
<Octavia> 14My friends mom came back and gave me a ride.
<Cracky> i need another too
<DesertRose> hmm
<RainBroDash> 10woot :D
<ValtheImpaler> hurray!
<Colgate> only ~65 GB of free space
<RobotPinkie> Nice, Octavia!
<Cracky> only 122GB left
<Razyn> 0Yay~?
<Octavia> 14lol
<Mongoose> Nothing will stop me from gnawing hooves
*BlacklightShining only has ~25 GB of space left
<Cracky> I no longer delete files, I buy new hard drives
<johnsey> oh nice, 3TB disks have gotten cheap, now that you mention it
<Cracky> it's actually cheaper
<Luna> 11wb
<DesertRose> everythings cheaper
<Colgate> they under 200$ now?
<BlacklightShining> argh!
<Dermathil> MUSIC POST
*Mongoose has 2 GB left

<Mongoose> no wait
<Mongoose> 7 Gb
<BlacklightShining> 3 TB disks!
<BlacklightShining> why?!
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Music: Luna(Trance/Dubstep Remix) / Trees of Gold / Always The Moon (http://tinyurl.com/3o7uvoc)
<DesertRose> got 4GB ram cards for £15 each, 1366MHz kingston ones
<KShrike> I hate haters who are hypocrites (Though not direct hypocrites)
<GumballCrash> 3TB disks: because I need room for ponies
<Colgate> /home/rabbit/MyLittlePony 42,100 items, totalling 48.6 GB
<BlacklightShining> why can't they just stuck to powers of two?!
<johnsey> Colgate: depends on the current exchage rate..uhm..
<DesertRose> everythings cheaper
<Cracky> I need a new power supply to run more disks though
<Octavia> 14Yay, Luna welcomed me back. Best day. <3
<Colgate> I'll just look it up on newegg
<Razyn> 0I hope it's better than that other Luna deubstep...
<DesertRose> but then again i did get those ram cards tax free
<johnsey> $170
<BlacklightShining> all these 750 GB and 3 TB stuff is annoying the heck out of me
<Cracky> 3TB: $129.99
<Marshmelon> `Colgate: Your username is 'rabbit'?
<Colgate> yes
<Cracky> err, $129.98
*BlacklightShining 's username is TC
<Cracky> gotta get two of those
<Cracky> and RAID em
<Owloysius> Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
<BlacklightShining> oh, the stats
<BlacklightShining> I keep forgetting about themm
<DesertRose> would probably be cheaper to buy an internal HDD and also get a HDD caddy
<Colgate> 130$ for a 3 TB HDD, what?
<Cracky> eeyup
<BlacklightShining> what!
<Colgate> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822145493

<Octavia> 14Do'h!
<Colgate> but alas, it is time for...
<ValtheImpaler> PONIES WITH SOCKS
<RainBroDash> 10so far the trancey part, not toooo bad
<GumballCrash> the current wave of 3TB drives worry me

<Marshmelon> Hey, dat music post.
<Cracky> I should also buy an SSD
<Cracky> or five
<FluffyWuffs> I always have bad experiences with Hitachi drives.
<FluffyWuffs> they always fail :[
<Marshmelon> Later colgate|nap
<redd> whats a terrabyte?
<GumballCrash> could be worse, you could have a Maxtor
<DesertRose> everythings always so god damn expensive in the UK
<FluffyWuffs> terrabytes are 1000gb
<Cracky> lolmaxtor
<redd> WOAAHH
<FluffyWuffs> Maxtor's are horrible
<redd> 1000gB?
<DesertRose> NO, a 1TB is 1024GB
<BlacklightShining> FluffyWuffs: 1,024 *
<GumballCrash> and seagate buying maxtor is why i won't buy seagate ever
<Razyn> 0Frantic Keyscratching. Always funny.
<Cracky> I once had a Maxtor drive physicaly disintigrate on my
<BlacklightShining> 2^

<redd> WWOOOOAAAHHH
<Cracky> it jsut turned into a whirly blender of hard drive SHRAPNEL
<Marshmelon> redd, do you do any music stuff?
<FluffyWuffs> segate & western digital are my preferred HDD's
<redd> way more thn needed
<DesertRose> well actualy yea....1TB is 1 Trillion bytes
<BlacklightShining> …
<redd> i play gutar
*BlacklightShining facehooves
<GumballCrash> I vouch WD for reliability, if only because
<redd> why
<BlacklightShining> TB SI *
<Marshmelon> just asking
<johnsey> TiB that would be
<GumballCrash> 420mb WD HDD. Manufacture date April 1994
<BlacklightShining> or * 1,024 GB
<Cracky> FluffyWuffs: Good man, I'm also all for Seagate/WD
<GumballCrash> still running strong today.

<Luna> 11http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-derpy-invades-your-windows.jpg
<Octavia> i sent a 500gb WD back to them for repairs, they could not repair it and did not have that model anymore so they sent me a 1TB as a replacement.
<Cracky> I like the seagates a bit better I think
<DesertRose> hmmm
<Marshmelon> Well...
<johnsey> Octavia: eeyup that happens quite often
<RobotPinkie> >mfw I need to reboot right now...
<redd> time to get my code on!
<redd> brb
<Marshmelon> Consider me offline.
<Octavia> i was like <3u
<Luna> 11why?
<Razyn> 0Why?
<FluffyWuffs> seagates really are good now, compared to the older models
<RobotPinkie> sound's shot, headphones out of batteries. :P
<DesertRose> a 3TB hard drive costs £120 here in the UK, thats over $190
<DesertRose> after the exchange
<RobotPinkie> brb
<Razyn> 0Sounds always shot.
<LightDasher> !flip

<FluffyWuffs> I'll stick to raid
<Cracky> GumballCrash: long a go
<RobotPinkie> Oh there I am again.
<FluffyWuffs> since the economy accidentally itself
<GumballCrash> clearly
<ValtheImpaler> lies
<Razyn> 0I shall be off for awhile as well. See you all in 15!
<Cracky> when the US uneconomied
<GumballCrash> welp, at least not all is lost
<ShadTheCrazed> Well, my research on the portal has cme to an end.
<Cracky> i LIKE TRIPS TO THE us A LOT MORE NOW :P
<ShadTheCrazed> *come
<Cracky> oops, caps
<RobotPinkie> cya Razyn
<ValtheImpaler> see ya razyn
*GumballCrash lives in a US state without sales tax!
<Shadowmane> hmm, still no sign of any of those kids. Oh well.
<FluffyWuffs> :P
<FluffyWuffs> wat
<GumballCrash> VAT, to all our UK bretheren
<LightDasher> man I just cleared out my email and I keep thinking I delete a reply ;^;
*Octavia 's state has crazy taxes.
<LightDasher> but I don't want to send again incase they haven't replied
<ShadTheCrazed> Seems it was just a failed attempt by Trixie, and not Twilight Sparkle.
<GumballCrash> Taxachusetts?
*Cracky thinks of HST
<FluffyWuffs> lol, 70% of Americans are probably still blaming China
<ShadTheCrazed> Sorry guys, no portal to Equestria yet.
<RobotPinkie> >greeted by Luna desktop on reboot
<RobotPinkie> So nice.
<Elky> >Luna
<Elky> >not Applejack
<Cracky> A portal to equestria will probably be in the form of a matrix-like mind plug thing
<Octavia> oklahoma/arkansas, i live in one and work in the other. state and federal taxes on pay, sales, and income.
<DinkyTroll> Donitz, you on?
<GumballCrash> ouch
<RainBroDash> 10>AJ
<RainBroDash> 10get out
<Donitz> yes
<FluffyWuffs> :/
<RobotPinkie> >Same wallpaper as Sathi
<RobotPinkie> lol or
<RainBroDash> 10also stream is derping so hard
<RainBroDash> 10assadmgagf
<RobotPinkie> >same wallpaper as Luna
<ShadTheCrazed> But hey, at least I got to witness it! Couldn't get a recording, though.
<Elky> >having a bad connection
<FluffyWuffs> I just try to avoid living next to the rich
<Elky> >liking Rainbow Dash
<johnsey> it's a wonder people actually live in other states if they pay less in one state
<Elky> related?
<BlacklightShining> when a portal to Equestria is made, it needs to automatically convert to pony when you go through it
<ShadTheCrazed> /joke
<RobotPinkie> inb4 kick
<Octavia> johnsey, family house
<Elky> just asking, since I'm not experiencing any derping
<Octavia> i miss alaska, no sales tax at all.
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<johnsey> yeah but typically people tend to jump through all kinds of hoops in order to avoid taxes
<RobotPinkie> lol stream's fine for me right now
<ValtheImpaler> same
<RainBroDash> 10no it's all my connection
<RobotPinkie> wasn't earlier, though, so...
<RainBroDash> 10I know that
<Octavia> i am reversed, honestly. i would avoid taxes living in arkansas
<RainBroDash> 10I'll speedtest for you
<RainBroDash> 10just because I like it when people feel sorry for me :3
<GumballCrash> tax avoidance is fine. Tax evasion...well
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<GumballCrash> they'd better pray I never get a job at the IRS. Or I will find them.
<RobotPinkie> 0.1kbps down, 0.01kbps up
<Marshmelon|C_M_O> Shad, is there some reason why a portal by Trixie is unfavorable to a portal by Twilight Sparkle?
<Octavia> i have to pay almost twice throughout the year, get most of it back, and i have to file my gas receipts to get most of it back
<Elky> uh...
<DinkyTroll> Well, your SoTB characters are being used in RP.
<DinkyTroll> :P
<DinkyTroll> Just FYI
<BlacklightShining> DinkyTroll?
<BlacklightShining> O.o
<BlacklightShining> o.O
<Donitz> nice
<MrPoniator> A new flash, that's going to be 1320 frames long, and at 24fps that equals to 55 seconds, though the main animation ends around 40sec mark already.
<MrPoniator> Personal deadline: Have it done before September 1st (University starts etc).
<Octavia> i actually get 60% of my gas costs to and from work because i travel over 50 miles a day and my truck is considered a work expense
<MrPoniator> >Oh boy here we go.jpg

<RainBroDash> 10oh wow
<FluffyWuffs> I know, the one with gaming?
<RainBroDash> 10this is the best one ever
<FluffyWuffs> yeah it's actually outdated

<FluffyWuffs> good to follow
<Luna> 11dat grade f
<Octavia> johnsey, if i get this new job, i will be over the luna-populated moon happy, otherwise i am just doing it to survive.

<ValtheImpaler> lol
<Cracky> i learned how to sew today
<Cracky> was humming that the whole way through

<FluffyWuffs> if you want better tutorials for game-coding in java, probably just youtube a couple videos
<RobotPinkie> F-, even, oh wow
<johnsey> Octavia: keeping my hooves crossed for ya
<FluffyWuffs> or google
<Charles> my dog is going blind, so it is only a matter of time before we lose her
<Ghosties> 4Chase, just fuck her already
<RobotPinkie> I thought F was the lowest...
<Octavia> johnsey, thank you, dear :)
<Dermathil> better than grade G+
<FluffyWuffs> thenewboston should have something on it probably
<Sally> pets shouldnt be allowed to get sick or die
<Charles> no, they should'nt :(
<FallSilently> Going for a new job? Well best of luck to you.
<Cracky> Man, I just can't stand java...
<Sally> :c
<RainBroDash> 10my upload is better than my d/l
<RobotPinkie> My connection is pretty solid, my ISP just doesn't like competition...
<FluffyWuffs> I haven't stuck my nose in it yet, so I can't really judge
<RobotPinkie> ...so that's why I'm going to switch to a slightly friendlier ISP
<Marshmelon|C_M_O> ShadtheCrazed: I know, but you said it was "just" a portabl by Trixie, and not Twilight Sparkle
<Charles> I just wish we did not get german sheperds all the time, they are the most loveable dogs ever, but they also have a high risk of something, anything really, going wrong with them
<GumballCrash> ugh java
<Luna> 11Do eeet
<Solarstorm> hm, are the fanfics available in .mobi or epub format anywhere?
<RainBroDash> 10it's just the cables here

<ShadTheCrazed> Marshmelon|C_M_O: I have a tendancy to say "just" all the time.

<Marshmelon|C_M_O> Also, DinkyTroll, What is "SoTB"
<Sally> :o really? i didnt know that
<Charles> yeah

<Spazturtle> my average is 5.55/0.85
<FallSilently> Yes, so I'm informed.
<FluffyWuffs> congrats :D
<RobotPinkie> There's not much choice in Stockholm, it's all very fast.
<BlacklightShining> I thought they weren't looking for any more mods…
<Spazturtle> The UK is number #100 on the top 100 faster countries
<FallSilently> Think of me more as a special victim.
<FluffyWuffs> seeing a few new ones here and there
<Elky> 22/4 here
<RainBroDash> 10UK internet on average is balls
<FluffyWuffs> meh
<Ghosties> 4Fuck that shit, fuck his shit up House
<FluffyWuffs> If I'm ever a mod, I'd probably be very power-hungry...
<BlacklightShining> 7. I wanna be mod! Well, by asking that anywhere on PonyChats you are one step AWAY from ever becoming one, aha! Currently we are not looking for mods, but if we’ll ever be in need we will be contacting potential candidates - if you are active and nice’n’swell, it may be you.
<ValtheImpaler> dat ending
<Ghosties> 4Whack him with your cane
<RobotPinkie> like my mom out in the middle of nowhere has 8/2 or something

<ValtheImpaler> GINGERS HAVE SOULS
<herospirit> Got to go eat. :0
<SladeJT> WHAT
<SladeJT> Why is that thing so infamously popular anyway?
<Cracky> Less infamously popular
<Ghosties> 4L.O.V.E this show
<ValtheImpaler> NOT THE NIGHT-LIGHT
<Cracky> more popularly infamous
<Ghosties> 4It is quite honestly the epitome of the 90's for me
<Spazturtle> Never seen it
<Elky> it looks fun so far
<FluffyWuffs> ?
<FallSilently> A combination of being early and being graphic.
<FluffyWuffs> that was a fast nap colgate
<Dermathil> Wait, this is a 90s SHOW?!
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Colgate> ~25 minutes
<SladeJT> And messed up - wait that's still graphic.
<Locke> Becuase apperantly everyone is a wimp who can't handle some gore.
<GGgala> Dermathil: y u so surprised?
<Ghosties> 4I found some great music through this show
<Dermathil> >mfw I originally thought it was a 70s show
<FluffyWuffs> did you dream about toothbrushes during those 25mins?
<FluffyWuffs> :3
<Spazturtle> Today I bought the S Club 7 cd
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<Ghosties> 4Fun fact: I used to really dislike this show as a kid
<Dermathil> due to the mom's haircut
<Cracky> NOT when it's Rainbow Dash's gore!
<Locke> Honestly it's a gorey story. Nothing else really.
<GGgala> heh
<Ghosties> 4Most likely because I just didn't get it
<Ghosties> 4But now?
<FluffyWuffs> I swear, I'll turn this pony into a fanon
*Locke fails to see how that chainges anything
<FluffyWuffs> watch me!
<Ghosties> 4Dear lord, I completely get it. I resonate with it
<Cracky> It's more colourful
<Locke> True
<Cracky> you can really "paint the walls" with it
<SladeJT> I can handle cartoon/fiction gore. It's when I can picture it vividly in my mind and (eventually due to my stupid imagination) place myself in either position...
*Locke claps
<DracoDei> To anyone who knows about the earlier generations: Gem-eyed ponies (whatever they were called) visually creepy? Yes or No.
<Colgate> FluffyWuffs: actually, I didn't dream at all, which is weird for me
<SladeJT> Yes
<FallSilently> Oh god yes
<redd-coding> looool
<Locke> Well I have to look a sableye an a regular basis so probably not that muc
<SladeJT> Their eyes were gouged out and replaced with FRICKING POINTY STONES.

<FallSilently> I thought those were cataracts.
<Dermathil> SAY NO AGAIN, I DARE YOU I DOUBLE DARE YOU
<Cracky> Rainbow dash doesn't actualy have a mane, she simply has access to potent illusionary magic
<ValtheImpaler> I like that the others are still frozen

<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Michael Arellano vs. Alex S. - Luna(Trance/Dubstep Remix)
<mib_j0ds81> OM SO ECITED
<Locke> name for who?
<FluffyWuffs> they might not even bring her back in s2
<Marshmelon|C_M_O> Shad: it's not great
<ShadTheCrazed> This is sheer greatness.
<Marshmelon|C_M_O> I listened to it
<Marshmelon|C_M_O> No
<Marshmelon|C_M_O> The original was greatness
<redd-coding> hello shad
<Marshmelon|C_M_O> This promises betterment of the song
<Marshmelon|C_M_O> Doesn't do anything better.
<johnsey> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/48486

<ShadTheCrazed> The original is better, yeah.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about vinyl artist:NarbeVoguel vinyl_scratch dj_p0n3 djp0n3 (and 1 more)
<Marshmelon|C_M_O> Just moves the verses around.
<Locke> What about "Kiss my ass pony"

<DesertRose> !link griffon

<Dermathil> They are certainly Princess Luna's most favored subjects
<Charles> well Sally, genetic issues usually mean that it is a predisposition to failure. they could give your dog a new kidney, but that would likely fail as well.
<GumballCrash> I forsee much excessive speeding in my future
<Charles> I think
<FluffyWuffs> Cause I don't want that nick
<redd-coding> dude
<DesertRose> I like my nick
<Luna> 11Indeed they are
<redd-coding> fluffywuffs
<Sally> oh :(
<GGgala> they will be spared when the Lunar Revolution comes
<redd-coding> pm me
<FallSilently> Probably because I've had my fill of ostentatios canon characters to roleplay.
<Locke> Super pony beat isn't my favriot
<Shaico> I need to post here more.

<FluffyWuffs> yeah, get an irc client
<Plorf> I have Colloquy
<FluffyWuffs> flash client has many setbacks
<Plorf> it is a Mac thing

<Dermathil> best recipe to stay awake.
<noa> there
<BlacklightShining> Colloquy has some bugs and flaws
<Blums> flash client looks clean though
<BlacklightShining> and it hasn't been updated in forever
<BlacklightShining> but other than that, it's good

<BlacklightShining> Adobe might kill Flash

<Plorf> why
<BlacklightShining> I heard something about that…
<Spazturtle> Dermathil I like a -30C shower
<BlacklightShining> I dunno
<Elky> but it definitely would involve coffee
<BlacklightShining> maybe because it's a resource hog?
<Dermathil> eeeeeeeyup Spaz
<FluffyWuffs> Adobe 'almost' killed flash
<BlacklightShining> maybe because it's buggy?
<BlacklightShining> *shrug*
<FluffyWuffs> yes
<FreezeFrame> Hate orientation stuff.
<FluffyWuffs> flash is still buggy
<FluffyWuffs> but not as bad
<Dermathil> also, stay away from alcohol.
<Octavia> i wonder
<FluffyWuffs> still, always good to spam ctrl+s
<GGgala> wow these kids are tripping balls
<Dermathil> That thing makes your system slow down.

<Dermathil> eeeeeeyup
<BlacklightShining> not under Lion!
<BlacklightShining> ^.^
<redd> ?
<FluffyWuffs> psh
<Cracky> The problem with Flash isn't Flash. The porblem with Flash is People using Flash wrong!
*BlacklightShining considers spamming command+S to be deprecated now
<BlacklightShining> it'll die soon

<BlacklightShining> Lion is the next major release of OS X
<Blums> pffft lion. Get one of those room sized computers and a crate of punchcards

<DesertRose> yup
<FluffyWuffs> even MLP is done with flash

<Sally> ah
<Blums> well html5's video tag doesnt seem to work as well as flash on my comp
<Plorf> I don't think there needs to be a war.
<BlacklightShining> Versions FTW!
<Colgate> Flash accelerated the internet big time, however, we need to go past flash now and move on
<BlacklightShining> now, the next thing we need
<DesertRose> were old enough to not have a flame war....
<GGgala> i'm just gonna assume the nineties camcorders were super expensive
<DesertRose> we are better than that
<Dermathil> Eh
<BlacklightShining> is a branch-type Versions
<GGgala> it was a dark age
<Plorf> And if not old enough, that at least mature enough.
<Octavia> LOVE and TOLERATE.
<DesertRose> yes.
<Spazturtle> (Yes she does)
<Plorf> the brony community is better at avoiding arguments than most
<FluffyWuffs> isn't Html 5 still being tested?
<Cracky> Flash is great for stuff like making youtube work
<Dermathil> eeeeeh
<Octavia> FluffyWuffs, yes
<Manearion> Hello everrone!
<Dermathil> She's way too cheesy.
<Cracky> HTML5 is beyond testing
<Manearion> I am back!
<DesertRose> Im guna love and tolerate the shit outa you, whether you use Mac,PC or even Linux
<Cracky> but it's still slow to adopt
<unicr0n|gone> html5 is in use already
<Dermathil> She should've used the HEALTH CARE card instead.
<Cracky> things take time
<FluffyWuffs> hrmp, I haven't noticed
<Blums> kinda like IPv6 but I still have an IPV4
<User_1824> Linux may be pushing it a bit...
<Dermathil> eeeeh
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<mbulu> I've seen Flash lag like hell on good machines. It needs to be replaced.
<unicr0n|gone> its getting hardware accelerated on most browsers now

<Cracky> it still has some uses
<FluffyWuffs> Flash needs to be made better
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<johnsey> geekshed's IPv6 support is still broken
<DesertRose> By the time you have head of it, it is already being marketed/incorporated into systems
<Cracky> it jsut needs to not be sprayed over everything
<GGgala> bwahahah
<unicr0n> flash still fills a niche
<Dermathil> You still haven't tried catching the Most legendary of all fanfics!!!
<Razyn> 0Shadowmane what are you talking about?
<johnsey> so annoying!
<unicr0n> nothing else does vector on the web really
<Colgate> that's another thing, IPv6, why didn't we do this switch years ago!
<BlacklightShining> ^
<Cracky> We are moving towards technological specialization
<Cracky> in the "old days" everything on the web was html
<Cracky> now there are many technologies with their own niches
<Sketchy_Sounds> "Overspecialise and you breed in weakness. It's slow death."

<Blums> we might aswell jump the gun and go to IPv16
<ValtheImpaler> hoo boy...that episode about not sleeping...made me rather sleep
<Ghosties> 4Whoa
<ValtheImpaler> sleepy*
<herospirit> ohai Elky
<Ghosties> 4Max Headroom
<ValtheImpaler> and it isn't even night tim
<ValtheImpaler> time*
<BlacklightShining> v16?!
<Blums> doesnt exist
<Ghosties> 4Man
<BlacklightShining> wait
<Ghosties> 4I forgot about that guy
<Elky> me too val
<ValtheImpaler> welcome back hero
<mbulu> wut
<FluffyWuffs> v16!!! holy ****
<Alpha_Renegade> what up internet people
<BlacklightShining> if v4 has 4 billion addresses
<GGgala> can't help but think of the trippy TV-hijacking Max Headroom guy
<herospirit> Thanks Val :]
<Cracky> no
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Sketchy_Sounds> IPv6 is initially going to mean all kinds of hell as suddenly every IP ban everywhere is rendered meaningless.
<Cracky> ipv6 will be enough
<Cracky> if it's not enough, we haev bigger problems
<BlacklightShining> and v6 has 4 billion ^ 4 addresses
<Dermathil> actually, about not-sleeping. I think just watching a livestream nonstop would keep me awake.
<Elky> oh, and if possible, requesting gargoyles
<mbulu> IP bans never worked well
<redd> PYROH YU NO ON???
<ShadowMane> Spazturtle, lol Pokedex
<BlacklightShining> then how many addresses would v16 have?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Cracky: "640KB is more than enough for anyone."
<DesertRose> Graphine....superconductivity at room temperature....another example of a scinetific breakthrough that you only recently hear about yet was discoverd ages ago
<BlacklightShining> O.O
<FluffyWuffs> the number of ips with ipv6 is very rediculus...
<ShadowMane> Dermathil, I'll get around to it, I swear. Past Sins is on the list as well. Lots to do
<Cracky> Sketchy_Sounds: Do you realize how "big" ipv6 is?
<Dermathil> I hope FO:E is higher than Past-Sins.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I do, yes.
<FluffyWuffs> BIG
<Spazturtle> I thin i'm going to go watch futerama now, bye
<Cracky> we will run out of physical materials for buildign stuff before we run out of ipv6 addresses
<FluffyWuffs> thats how big
<Dermathil> What other fic has 250 readers all at once on the Googledoc?
<FluffyWuffs> nuffsaid
<ValtheImpaler> see ya later spaz
<FluffyWuffs> your arguments
<FluffyWuffs> are invalid
<Sketchy_Sounds> Don't underestimate the human race's ability to use up all of an available resourse.
<Dermathil> SMURFS!!!!
<Dermathil> THE OLD SHOW!!!!
<Blums> mining mercury =D
<Sketchy_Sounds> **resource
<Cracky> We will use up all of the other resources first
<BlacklightShining> pony --FTW
<BlacklightShining> your arguments are invalid
<Razyn> 0Smurfs has 250 readers at once...?
<Dermathil> ...
<Dermathil> no
<Dermathil> FO:E
<Cracky> Ipv7 might make sense when we become a large interstelar society...
<ShadowMane> eeewwwwwww
<BlacklightShining> ^
<herospirit> OH NO
<GGgala> Smurfs Classic?
<Dermathil> Smurfs are giving me an enormous rush of nostalgia tho.
<interior_gummy> hey everypony
<herospirit> Smurfs are invading
<FluffyWuffs> Cracky: the future is already here
<ValtheImpaler> howdy gummer
<Blums> even if we make nanomachines?
<ValtheImpaler> gummy
<ShadowMane> why would we watch a show where the only female was a trap placed by the main antagonist
<GGgala> is Are You Afraid of the Dark in here?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Naa, we'll just recycle the IPv6 addresses when the sun consumes Earth and we move to Mars.
<ValtheImpaler> man....my spelling is atrocious today
<DesertRose> nah
<Dermathil> POWER RANGERS
<interior_gummy> hey, wanna watch nostalgia critic?
<herospirit> POWER RANGERS
<Dermathil> MMPR
<DesertRose> by that time we will have cracked faster than light travel
<GGgala> lawl, Beatles cartoon
<GGgala> OMG XENA
<ShadowMane> we should watch Batman, that animated series
<interior_gummy> wat?
<Blums> I think we're closer to nanomachines than FTL..
<interior_gummy> YES
<Dermathil> I'd best request moar Duck Tales if possible
<ShadowMane> white fang? what's that
<Sketchy_Sounds> ^
<Dermathil> The show was awesome.
<interior_gummy> i've wanted to see that batman cartoon for a while
<BlacklightShining> http://www.xkcd.com/865/
<DesertRose> mhm
<Blums> lol that comic
<herospirit> butbutbut Power Rangers :[
<Cracky> We are closer to everything else than FTL
<Elky> .
<BlacklightShining> FTL FTL
<interior_gummy> one of the best kids' cartoons of the 90s (2nd after animaniacs)
<ShadowMane> lol mfw i'm nostalgia'ing every other show
<Dermathil> >robocop
<Elky> bah, we watch enough gokaiger as it is
<interior_gummy> speaking of, HOLY CRAP ANIMANIACS
*ValtheImpaler has the entire batman animated series on dvd. You jelly?
<herospirit> Go go pony rangers
<DesertRose> hehe
<ShadowMane> mfw Animaniacs. I miss that show
<Dermathil> WHERE ANIMANIACS
<Cracky> Only Pinkie Pie poseses true FTL
<BlacklightShining> aw, nopony likes my jokes

<Dermathil> TTZ
<Dermathil> THE TWILIGHT ZONE
<interior_gummy> they got away with so much crap
<redd> i jus t dont get them
<Razyn> 0The Twilight Zone. O shit
<Sketchy_Sounds> I liked it, Blackie
<Dermathil> yay Duck Tales
<interior_gummy> they made a joke about giving prince a handjob
<redd> lol
<DesertRose> FTL is just a theory....like flying was a theory in the 1800's
<interior_gummy> and it got tv-y
<GGgala> interior_gummy: NOPE
<redd> yo
<BlacklightShining> *weak smile* thanks
<redd> how do i register?
<Razyn> 0Wasn't it fingering Prince?
<ValtheImpaler> Duck Tales WOOHOOO
<Dermathil> they did Razyn.
<GGgala> interior_gummy: that was assplay
<Blums> So we're closer to tunneling into other universes, building dyson spheres, harnessing ZPE, and other such things??
<BlacklightShining> /nickserv register [password (no spaces) ] [email address]
<interior_gummy> something like that
<DesertRose> only pursued by madmen and people with deathwishes
<Dermathil> Luna, my request for Duck Tales still stands.
<BlacklightShining> FOUR SPATIAL DIMENSIONS!
<interior_gummy> i vote animaniacs
<BlacklightShining> PORTAL TO EQUESTRIA!
<interior_gummy> if it's there
<DesertRose> YEA!
<Blums> pinkie resides in the fifth
<BlacklightShining> we'll get all that…and THEN FTL?
<Luna> 11Alright who wants DUCKTALES?

<Cracky> Blums: yes
<Luna> 11:p
<Dermathil> (I know)
<Aya> me
<Luna> 11that's 2
<Cracky> Seeing those things are theoreticaly possible :p
<Octavia> 14Why not? lol
<Dermathil> (Just to show the fact I wub that show so darn hard back in the day)
<Luna> 11that's 3
<BlacklightShining> what, what I said?
<ValtheImpaler> sure, let's go with ducktales
<Cracky> Especialy the Dyson Sphere one
<Luna> 11looks like we got a winner
<interior_gummy> eh, fuck it
<BlacklightShining> oh
<ValtheImpaler> I'm in the mood for nostalgia :P
<Dermathil> YAAAAAAAAAAY
<interior_gummy> ducktles
<Blums> yeah thats the most likely one
*Dermathil is nerdgasming oh so hard.
<Nittany_Tiger> What show did I miss?
<Blums> but if we can somehow find a way to enlarge a wormhole
<herospirit> They've goooot, a Friendship and a force that you've never seen before! They've gooot, the Elements to morph and to even up the score! Noooooo, Poooooo, -ny can take them down! Harmony lies on their SIIIEEEIIIEEEIIEEEIIIEEEIIIIIIDE!!
<interior_gummy> i was raised on dexter and johnny bravo myself
<BlacklightShining> tunneling into other universes
<BlacklightShining> Equestria first! ^
<herospirit> GO GO PONY RANGERS!
<Luna> 11any ep?
<Blums> maybe we can send FTL television broadcasts
<Luna> 11we had 6 eps of pony rangers
<BlacklightShining> and we need to develop a technology to convert people to pony
<DesertRose> we exist in our own dimension. we can create smaller dimesnions within out own, but cannot explore outside of our dimension
*Razyn 0brohoofs interior_gummy
<ValtheImpaler> ~life is like a hurricane here in Duckberg~
<FluffyWuffs> ftl?
<Cracky> i want a Matrioshka brain dedicated to computing the mind of pinkie pie
*BlacklightShining is not going to be happy as a human in Equestria
<FluffyWuffs> for the loss or faster than light?
<redd> ?
<Efreet> hnngh
<Dermathil> Luna, Is there the episode where there was that duck that got stuck in a 1-wheeled power armor?
<DesertRose> FTL = Faster Than Light
<Cracky> Converting people to pony is relativwely easy, compared to FTL
<Luna> 11No idea lol
<FluffyWuffs> Pinkie Pie IS Ftl
<Dermathil> oh wait
<FluffyWuffs> nuff said
<interior_gummy> and i watch those shows again and realize how much stuff they got away with
<Luna> 11it's not like I memorize all this
<Dermathil> an episode with BUBBA
<Nittany_Tiger> Hurricane.
<BlacklightShining> Cracky: really?
<herospirit> You lie Luna
<Cracky> all you need is mind-machine uploads and you're halfway there
<herospirit> We know you memorized this.
<FluffyWuffs> or gene fusions
<BlacklightShining> umm…
<DesertRose> theorecticly, FTL is just breaking outside the bounds of our own dimesnsion....
<Cracky> Then you just need to find a way to download into a pony
<Blums> Or you could engineer a pony body and transplant the brain within five minutes
<ValtheImpaler> inb4 Pinkie "WHEEEEE" gets replaced with Ducktale's "Woohoo
<Dermathil> what's the title of the E10? that I see bottom of list?
<BlacklightShining> …umm…
<DesertRose> Transvering a conciousness into another living body
<Cracky> AND THEN!
<interior_gummy> alternatively, let's try and survive a full episode of g3.5 ponies
<FluffyWuffs> a pony irl would probably freak me out...
<DesertRose> transfering*
<ValtheImpaler> NO
<Luna> 11Robot robbers
<BlacklightShining> …umm…
<Luna> 11we had tat one
<Dermathil> ah
<Blums> yeah fluffywuffs, the massive eyes would be
<ValtheImpaler> SATHI ALREADY TROLLED US WITH G3.6
<herospirit> ...
<ValtheImpaler> 5
<Blums> problematic
<Cracky> Pinkie Pie comes to life!
<Dermathil> look lower in the list
<Plorf> oh god
<BlacklightShining> …umm.
<Luna> 11and you all loved it
<BlacklightShining> wait
<Razyn> 0I'm up for some torture. Throw on some 3.5
<Plorf> real life pinkie pie would...
<Plorf> not exist
<BlacklightShining> what about the magic?
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<FluffyWuffs> XD
<DesertRose> a pony's brain could not contain a human concience,
<interior_gummy> I HOPE WE HEAR A STORY FROM CHEERILEE
<herospirit> I am brave. I third G3.5
<Cracky> Suficiently advanced technology...
<ValtheImpaler> more than Heman? Sure :P
<Dermathil> the G3.5 will only be after Duck Tales
<BlacklightShining> wouldn't the whole thing be impossible in this universe?
<FluffyWuffs> ponies are suddenly series business
<interior_gummy> RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYOLE
<ValtheImpaler> but nothing is better than UNI THE FUCKING UNICORN
<BlacklightShining> inb4 new Equestria Daily post notice
<DesertRose> it would probably overload and the brain would...you know....die
<Blums> just put a little tractor beam in the horn
<ShadowMane> you guys...
<Razyn> 0Yes~?
<Nittany_Tiger> What about Charlie the Unicorn?
<Cracky> I'd liek to be the man who unleashes Pinkie Pie upon the world
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Sepia Tock: Adventures of the Ponyville Clockmaker (http://tinyurl.com/3fzpcfb)
<Dermathil> ffff
<ValtheImpaler> not even close Nittany
<redd> i want a big macintosh episode... do yall?
<interior_gummy> FUCK YES
<DesertRose> Theres nothing in the laws of physics that says magic cant exist....
<Blums> if he's an interesting enough character
<DesertRose> atleast not that i know of
<Dermathil> And now people didn't let one of the great episodes I remember be taken.
<Razyn> 0muuuuuuuuuuuute
<herospirit> Three votes for G3.5! That would mean something if this was a democracy. :P
<BlacklightShining> …true
<interior_gummy> fun fact: you can't swim in coins, you'd just crash and di
<interior_gummy> *die
<BlacklightShining> but then, why haven't we discovered it yet?
<Dermathil> EEEEYUP
<redd> cool
<herospirit> This song is addicting.
<FluffyWuffs> I'd like more screen time for big mac
<interior_gummy> oh no
<Sketchy_Sounds> We have. We just call it science.
<FluffyWuffs> and derpy
<interior_gummy> it gets in my head again
<ValtheImpaler> lol interior, I saw that college humor vid :P
<jasperdett> :D
<redd> just wanted to know if you guys wanted an epsode too
<Dermathil> YES
<BlacklightShining> uh-uh
<redd> yeaj
<Efreet> Disregard physics, become pinkie pie
<Blums> and someday science will progress enough that we can have something like magic wands
<redd> yeah, and like, more male characters
<BlacklightShining> science |ˈsīəns| noun
<BlacklightShining> the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment:
<DesertRose> because it doesnt reside in our known universe
<FluffyWuffs> More screen time for Lyra and Bon bon too
<Dermathil> I GOTTA WATCH THE EPISODE WITH THE LITTLE PINK DUCK IN THE BASKET
<DesertRose> doesnt mean it cant exist
<BlacklightShining> the systematic study of
<Blums> there will be no pony couples
<Blums> ever
<Nittany_Tiger> Most everyone in that show are dogs.
<herospirit> I'm a young adult sitting in my basement watching Duck Tales
<FluffyWuffs> lol
<herospirit> I have lost at life
<DesertRose> what about Mrs and Mr Cake?
<Blums> because this is a kids show
<Dermathil> or what about the hindentenic episode?
<Cracky> Mr and Mrs Cake
<Blums> well theyre married
<Cracky> You are WRONG
<Cracky> I WIN
<BlacklightShining> Blums: not in the official show
<redd> there
<interior_gummy> i wonder who the villain is? :P
<redd> im register
<ValtheImpaler> herospirit, that's not how you spell epic win
<BlacklightShining> but in the fan…
<herospirit> I lost so hard, that I have won.
<Sketchy_Sounds> A lot of what we take for granted nowadays would be considered magic barely even a century or two back.
<FluffyWuffs> FANON>YOUR ARGUMENTS
<Razyn> 0That's the spirit
<DesertRose> YEA^
<DesertRose> we can dream cant we?
<Blums> XD
<herospirit> @pony the pony is the richest duck in the world
<interior_gummy> scrooge mcdemo
<Dermathil> (a titanic joke with hindenberg spin)
<herospirit> Awww, still broken.
<Nittany_Tiger> That old duck guy could run Activision.
<ValtheImpaler> no he was fixed
<DesertRose> and anything cannonial we dont like we can shun....just like religeon shuns the big bang theory
<ValtheImpaler> but Denied banned him :P
<ValtheImpaler> after Steven acted very unruly mind you :P
<herospirit> Steven is gone... FOOOOOREEEEEVEEEEEER.
<BlacklightShining> heh
<DesertRose> and allot of other science stuff
<Sketchy_Sounds> Heck, I found it mildly disconcerting at one point some months back when I first tethered my phone to use as a modem. I tethered it via Bluetooth. So it was sat there, no physical connection to my PC. And the phone had no physical connection to the internet. And yet I had net access.
<jasperbot> hi there
<Nittany_Tiger> :<
<BlacklightShining> lol
<Blums> bringing modern tech back into the 50 BC period =D
<Sketchy_Sounds> And I was like WHAT IS THIS SORCERY
<BlacklightShining> oh dear Luna
<Dermathil> WAAAAAH
<ValtheImpaler> my eyes!
<Luna> 11shitty ep..
<DesertRose> hehe
<Dermathil> WHO IS THAT PINK
<Luna> 11switching
<GGgala> wait, didn't we see this ep before?
<ValtheImpaler> they are seizuring!
<Nittany_Tiger> It's Bobby Koduck!
<Blums> maybe from a nearby tower?
<Luna> 11and fixed
<interior_gummy> the two richest people in the world are scottish ducks?
<GGgala> they make a bet and there's a sailboat made entirely of solid gold?
<Sketchy_Sounds> I mean yeah, I know how it worked and all, but it was still bizarre to do.
<Blums> XD
<DesertRose> hmm
<Sketchy_Sounds> You know what else is freaky?
<interior_gummy> SPOILER ALERT: scrooge wins
<Sketchy_Sounds> Wireless charging.
<Dermathil> .....
<herospirit> DAMNIT GUMMY
<interior_gummy> but he only makes 1 coin, and the other guy makes 0
<herospirit> GUUUUUMMMMYYYYYY
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's done by magnetic induction loop.
<Blums> Well its not like its constantly radiating electricity into every direction
<DesertRose> what was bizzar for me was getting a lightbulb to light up without a power source....dunno how the fuck it happened still
<mbulu> wireless charging is old
<ValtheImpaler> Millionaires making $0 in two weeks
<ValtheImpaler> mfw
*Luna 11aims her kickboot at gummy
<Dermathil> Valthejean, that's only out of nothing
<herospirit> I watch this show FOR THE PLOT, Gummy!
<GGgala> if there's one thing that makes DuckTales, it's shocking plot twists like those!
<Sketchy_Sounds> And it's weird as hell, because it's like, a device just starts charging within a certain proximity to a thing.
<BlacklightShining> Blums: tower?
<interior_gummy> eww, what's great about duck asses?
<Blums> yeah
<interior_gummy> horse asses are better for some reason
*Dermathil slaps interior_gummy hard.
<BlacklightShining> mbulu: then how come I still need to plug in my MacBook Pro?
<BlacklightShining> Blums: ?
*GGgala looks at ShadowMane. Then turns to look at SilverMane. Double-takes.
<herospirit> ASS.
<Dari> Ha ha ha
<Dari> It works
<Dari> Amazing
<Blums> the wireless charger
<GGgala> what happen
<ValtheImpaler> O_o
<herospirit> AEIOU
<SilverMane> ShadowMane?
<interior_gummy> i trolled
<SilverMane> SHADOWMANE!?!?
<ValtheImpaler> let this be their final battle
<SilverMane> I'll kill you if you don't get out of here right now old man.
<ValtheImpaler> QUE THE FF END BOSS MUSIC
<GGgala> too late Silver!
<BlacklightShining> >observe no reply from mbulu
<BlacklightShining> >conclude no valid reply exists
<mbulu> just because something is old doesn't mean it's practical
<Dermathil> >yfw that is middle-east and not south america
<SilverMane> he's gone. Good.
<interior_gummy> dem stereotypes
<SilverMane> No one should interact with shadowmane
<ValtheImpaler> well that was a boring boss fight
<BlacklightShining> oh
<Blums> after all, we still havent cracked cold fusion
<GGgala> oh hey, it's the random featureless rocky mountains and plateaus from the Road Runner/Coyote toons
<herospirit> What is this Shadowmane creature we speak of
<BlacklightShining> I thought you meant practical applications of wireless charging have been out for a while
<Blums> or controlled fusion for that matter
<BlacklightShining> :P
<herospirit> Inform me
<mbulu> no worries
<GGgala> is this pauper-dari?
<ValtheImpaler> dari awake at this hour?
<SilverMane> don't worry about it herospirit
<Dari> Well, I'm in France now.
<Cracky> cold fusion is a funny term
<DesertRose> fusion is beyond our own plannet
<interior_gummy> dat quicksand
<Cracky> it does'nt really mean anything
<Luna> 11viva la france!
<Dermathil> DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARI
<ValtheImpaler> what is Dari doing with those Cheese-eating surrender monkeys? :P
<Dermathil> WAT
<DerpyHooves> hey guys

<DerpyHooves> would you like to see how
<Dermathil> lawl
<Sketchy_Sounds> You know what else is weird
<Blums> i know but we can do it here too
<GGgala> pauper-dari, something terrible has happened! somebody /kicked Steven_Magnet for no raisin!
<interior_gummy> did he say "get a room"?
<Dari> >mum describes my suit as a pimp suit
<DerpyHooves> I see
<Sketchy_Sounds> Light apparently being able to provide propulsion.
<Dari> I'mokaywiththis
<ValtheImpaler> steven insulted denied's honor :P
<Blums> also cold fusion is possible, just fuse anything heavier than iron at room temp
<FallSilently> Anyhoo, Is time for me to being going to bed.
<BlacklightShining> (DerpyHooves: I think that's a reply to a message posted before you joined)
<Blums> yeah that is weird sketchy XD
<DerpyHooves> I know
<Cracky> Or jsut use electrical confinemt fusion, that's "cold"
<Colgate> Sketchy_Sounds: doesn't seem weird to me, does light have energy and or mass? then it can
<Mongoose> I'm gonna go
<SilverMane> durrgan?
<Dari> I win.
<FallSilently> I'll see yiz all upon the dawn of the new morn.
<interior_gummy> i think that dog might want gold
<Mongoose> See you guys another time
<Sketchy_Sounds> I remember reading about that recently and being all "...the crap."

<Dermathil> @pony Steven_Magnet
<DesertRose> well....for fusion to start naturaly, you need allot of hydrogen...and i mean allot.....for there to be enough energy to start the reaction, and then you need a continuous supply of fuel to keep it going. without the extreme amount of mass its near impossible to keep a fusion reaction stable
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Steven_Magnet is 8Sapphire 12Sh11or12es

<Dermathil> What?
<DerpyHooves> watched it to see all the hubbub
<Dari> SilverMane: In France, no Durrrrgurrrrrr
<ValtheImpaler> :P
<DesertRose> Light is a photon, it has mass
<BlacklightShining> >joke “hubbub”
<Sketchy_Sounds> Colgate: True. Of course, light is a crazy-ass thing anyway, what with it being a wave and a particle and doing all sorts of other weird stuff it shouldn't be able to.
<Dermathil> lawl
<Blums> Well no desert you just need to put enough pressure on or excite the hydrogen enough that it fuses
<interior_gummy> interior_gummy is Twist
<Octavia> 14WB Dari :P
<SilverMane> Dari, no French Durrgurr?
<Dari> Thanks
<Cracky> photons do not have mass
<Dermathil> FOOORE!!!!
<Dari> I don't have FME installed here
<Dari> Nor did I bother transferring the save file to this laptop.
<DesertRose> just a posotive electron....
<Dari> :P
<Cracky> uhhh
<Cracky> you are thinking of positrons
<Cracky> not photons
<DesertRose> ahh crap
<Octavia> 14@InFrancemeter Dari

<Steven_Magnet> 6 France is 26% French. (1521)
<Octavia> 14The other 44% is back home. :P
<SilverMane> k...
<Blums> what would they do with a fusion reactor anyways? they'd probably still use it to heat water to turn a turbine wouldnt they?
<Cracky> and DesertRose fusiuon has little to do with mass
<Cracky> except in the case of stars
<Luna> 11so what's next after this ep?

<Dermathil> O____O
<herospirit> Unless someone tells me otherwise, I'm assuming Silvermane tried some Black Magic. Silvermane was removed from his or her body, and the one he or she inhabits now is a shell of metal and biologically crafted fake skin. Silvermane's body was left, mangled and bleeding, to the demon Silvermane had accidentally summoned.
<SilverMane> i'm bored and moderately something or other. where is my shi- story partner?
<interior_gummy> if fluttershy lived in a tree and then ate a bonsai, would it be treeception?
<GGgala> o_0
<Dari> Sister probably wants to talk to her boyfriend on FB.
<Dari> So I'll be going.
<Octavia> 14Awww
<Blums> so its not going to supply a bajillion times more energy per reactor than fusion
<interior_gummy> confound that sister
<Dermathil> tell her to use her cellphone
<Luna> 11later Dari
<Blums> i mean fission
<SilverMane> herospirit... wow. just wow. No. Shadowmane... is my father
<ValtheImpaler> awwww
<DesertRose> to create a stable fusion reaction you need allot of energy, in stars that evergy comes from the shere mass of the hydrogen
<herospirit> It now inhabits his or her old body, stalking the soul that used to inhabit it's body. It is now known as Shadowmane.
<Dari> Cya
<ValtheImpaler> was good to see you dari
<Octavia> 14See ya Dari
<DesertRose> Fission is splitting atoms
<GGgala> cya Dari
<Cracky> Blums: the idea is not OMG massive ENRGY, the idea is OMG, cheap fuel
<DesertRose> and harvesting the energy
<interior_gummy> but bye dari
<FreezeFrame> That's a cool idea, though, herospirit.
<Blums> well yeah theres that
<herospirit> @correctmeter Herospirit's Shadowmane story
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Herospirit's Shadowmane story is 43% correct. (1523)
<SilverMane> (yfw I stole it)
<DesertRose> Fusion is slamming two atoms together to make a new atom
<Ali1017> Oh the days of Sim City 2000, how I miss the fission power plant.
<herospirit> Steven was off by 57%
<GGgala> i keep reading ShadowMane as SlenderMane for some reason...
<Blums> desert rose fusion releases more energy than it takes to induce it =P otherwise fusion would be moot
<SilverMane> (i'm stealing that idea)
<Blums> well.. for everything up to excluding iron at least
*SilverMane is the son of Slendermane. It's canon now
<herospirit> I'm cool with that. B]
<interior_gummy> THEE GOLD
<Blums> once you start the reaction the problem is making it go at a steady controlled rate
<GGgala> SilverMane: OH GOD
<GGgala> what have i done
<Vinylle> hey hey
<DesertRose> urg am i getting fusion and fission mixes up again?
<Blums> hi
<herospirit> POLYTICIANS.
<SilverMane> Hey, nice camera you have there.
<ValtheImpaler> so it was -14% right then herospirit? *trollface*
<Blums> no you arent desert
<DesertRose> fusion = stars, fission = reactors....right
<herospirit> :[
<DesertRose> yea
<Vinylle> I wish Cheerilee was my teacher for all classes
<ValtheImpaler> >: D
<DesertRose> that would be awesome
<herospirit> wait, it's negative percent?
<Blums> I hope we hear a story from cherilee
<herospirit> That means.... Shadowmane isn't the demon.....
<GGgala> >.> wh-what camera...
<BlacklightShining> (DerpyHooves: The thing is, there was already a conversation going on. From my experience on IRC, if you try to introduce a topic to a channel when there's already a conversation going on, ponies tend to ignore you.)
<BlacklightShining> (just saying)
<herospirit> SILVERMANE IS.
<Vinylle> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<Vinylle> yes
<Vinylle> yes
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Vinylle in a tight embrace

<herospirit> D:
<interior_gummy> randomdash?
<SilverMane> (shhh, stop trying to blow my cover herospirit)
<GGgala> i missed the rainbow dash, aw
<BlacklightShining> me too
<Blums> me three

<Vinylle> Derpy was obviously
<Vinylle> the best at blowing bubbles
<Author> Hello people I have possibly met before but was not properly introduced to!
<Blums> maybe its for bubblewrap?
<herospirit> Seman Chip badges? THE FUCK, SCROOGE
<GGgala> solid gold sure is shipworthy!
<SilverMane> are they using gold as planking?
<Blums> Hello
<GGgala> >GOLD SAILS
<DesertRose> cutie marks are not to be taken literaly
<SilverMane> wow, cloth gold
<GGgala> ur doin it rong
<Octavia> 14Indeed
<SilverMane> Rarity must be on board
<interior_gummy> so are we watching g3.5 ponies for the lulz after this?
<ValtheImpaler> duh, EVERYONE knows gold is not only buoyant but is the best material to make armor out of :P
<BlacklightShining> ^
<herospirit> I sure hope so gummy
<SilverMane> ^
<Vinylle> Why?
<DesertRose> because somehow wanting to always win a race means a rainbow lightning bolt
<Vinylle> Applejack ha apples
<Vinylle> and she bucks apples
<DesertRose> with afew exceptions
<herospirit> Furry lads, get me a cannon bowl!
<GGgala> actually... we eshould stream Marble Hornets sometime
<BlacklightShining> DesertRose: you know the Sonic Rainboom?
<Vinylle> She is RANBOW DASH
<SilverMane> ^
<Nittany_Tiger> How did they melt the gold in order to shape it?
<Blums> well cherilee has flowers or something and shes a teacher so..
<Vinylle> lightning rpresents speed
<Vinylle> and she can FLY
<Vinylle> so the cloud
<SilverMane> I haven't watched Marble Hornets in forever
<ValtheImpaler> magic Nittany :P
<BlacklightShining> it's when you go really fast (lightning-fast) and you get a rainbow
<GGgala> gotta come up with a playlist
<herospirit> WHAT
<BlacklightShining> *shrug* makes sense to me
<Dermathil> There needs to be a MLP-Duck Tales crossover
<GGgala> it's still running, isn't it SilverMane?
<herospirit> Firearms in children's cartoon, Ftw
<Vinylle> speaking of Rainbow Dash
<SilverMane> GGgala, probably
<GGgala> ...there are PATCHES in their SOLID GOLD SAILS
<Vinylle> I read the story "Cupcakes" yesterday
<BlacklightShining> no, ShadTheCrazed is not Rainbow Dash
<Cell> Hey, you guys see the new season 2 opening?

<Blums> somepony should write a happylight story named cupcakes
*GumballCrash facehoofs
<Vinylle> It was the most disgusting thing I've ever read
<herospirit> So, do we now have an official Shadowmane origin story?
<Vinylle> I almot puked
<SilverMane> Shadowmane is my father
<herospirit> NOPE
<SilverMane> that's all there is to it. He's a pegasus like me
<herospirit> NOPE.

<Dermathil> LOL, A PP IN A BARREL
<Ziltoid> omg david tennents hand
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<herospirit> That was troll level emotionless
<HaysforPonies> Imagine how much shipping fics are there with ponies and some character of another franchise.
<Ghosties> 4At least the older brother actually looked frightened
<herospirit> Troll 2 level
<Razyn> 0Oh you can see it.
<ValtheImpaler> it's a hole you retards!
<Ghosties> 4Oh man
<Ghosties> 4I miss this show
<herospirit> That riddle is pretty fucking easy
<Ziltoid> So whats this show?
<SilverMane> beat feet
<GGgala> beat fet
<Dermathil> actually, what about antimatter?
<GGgala> ...crap
<Ghosties> 4Are You Afraid of the Dark
<herospirit> "Are You Afraid of the Dark"
<Nittany_Tiger> Antimatter has mass.
<SilverMane> antimatter has mass, i do believe... wait, or is that darkmatter
<GGgala> with a question mark on the end, though.
<Nittany_Tiger> Could be photons.
<SilverMane> right, antimatter it the unweight
<Dermathil> Nittany_Tiger, one of the theories of antimatter is that Antimatter has negative mass
<SilverMane> THE AnSWER IS NOTHING
<GGgala> plus, antimatter doesn't make it lighter .it makes it explode
<SilverMane> ^
<Razyn> 0 444-4444
<Ziltoid> I dont remember this episode
<Nittany_Tiger> Actually, not really.
<herospirit> I am matter, I am antimatter, I can see your future, I consume time, and I will consume you!
<Razyn> 0Would Americans really get the 4 reference?
<Dermathil> HE SPARKLES IN THE DAYT
<SilverMane> matter and antimatter react when in contact to destroy each other, releasing the energy contained in their mass
<FreezeFrame> It's 555-5555 in the states. ;P
<GGgala> welcome to the taxi of rape
<FreezeFrame> Or 867-5309
<Sharksky> I need some wallpapers that are larger than 1600 by 900. Anyone got any Luna ones that fit that criteria?
<Razyn> 0Oh u
<Ziltoid> OH MAN
<Nittany_Tiger> Antimatter won't make things explode except if it meets it's opposite.
<interior_gummy> still on the same show?
<Ziltoid> DAT REVEAL
<Dermathil> Yes it will, Nittany.
<herospirit> SERIOUSLY. FORTY YEARS?!
<herospirit> NO ONE GOT IT IN FORTY FUCKING YEARS
<SilverMane> aaah
<Ghosties> 4Still no emotion on the kid's face -_-
<herospirit> Troll 2 Level scream.
<Dermathil> Antimatter and Matter negates eachother and turn into energy.
<Ghosties> 4God, put him out to pasture
*Dermathil has pepperspray.
<Razyn> 0Someone dies every day? The fuq?
<Nittany_Tiger> But the particles have to be the same.
<SilverMane> Nittany_Tiger, matter is matter, so matter and antimatter are the only two things that exist. therefore, if they contact each other, big badda boom
<Razyn> 0Forty years, a death every day?
<Nittany_Tiger> Read particle physics.
<Nittany_Tiger> Standard model.
<SilverMane> a proton is a proton, whether it is in copper, iron, carbon, or sodium
<herospirit> IT'S A FUCKING HOLE DAMN IT
<Ziltoid> lol
<Dermathil> A CHAINSAW THAT'S CUTTING ONE HALF OFF
<herospirit> HORRIBLE HORRIBLE ACTORS

<Dermathil> WEED

<ValtheImpaler> inb4 he's denied
<Sharksky> Thanks, BlacklightShining! ;D
<Vinylle> Yes DinkyTroll I do.
<Nittany_Tiger> The meth lab blew the house up.

<GGgala> Ghosties: Vink was also the villain in the episode with the Evil Pinball Game, wasn't he?
<BlacklightShining> when I refer ponies to Google
<BlacklightShining> I don't just refer them to Google
<Unidentified34643> What is Applejack holding? http://i53.tinypic.com/2ep1pqv.png
<Ghosties> 4Possibly
*Dermathil would've thumbed WAY down.
*Vinylle pukes all over DinkyTroll
<Ghosties> 4I know he was also in the Soup episode
<ValtheImpaler> ^
<SilverMane> do they ever deny anyone?
<BlacklightShining> I google it myself, add parameters, and then send a link
*DinkyTroll takes off the costume she had just incase.
*DinkyTroll walks away.
<Ghosties> 4I think they only did the voting for the original cast members
<ValtheImpaler> I'm guessing no since they let THAT GUY in :P
<Ghosties> 4Until the later recast
<Vinylle> because it was the moust disturbing disgusting thing I had ever read in my life

<ValtheImpaler> did SOMEPONY say clowns?
<ValtheImpaler> http://thelifestream.net/wp-content/uploads/dissidia_artwork_kefka.png
<Dermathil> I hope this is about ghosties.
<Dermathil> If it ain't, I be disappoint.
<Ghosties> 4Real clowns are just that, they're sarcastic assholes
<Ghosties> 4I love it
<SilverMane> i wonder what metal blend that powder is. probably has copper or sodium. nah, not sodium, that only reacts with water
<Dermathil> House is a clown then.
<AllisZero> Hey again guys
<herospirit> There is only ONE crazy clown I will abide, and that is GAMZEE. http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/137/8/3/gamzee___the_killing_honk_by_kenjisartdump-d3gc90q.png
<Nittany_Tiger> Clowns are nothing against violent updrafts.
<ValtheImpaler> phfff, that isn't a clown

<DinkyTroll> To be quite honest, Vin.
<Ghosties> 4That isn't a clown

<herospirit> I couldn't see it Ghosties. :[
<Luna> 11oh god IT back then gave me the creeps
<ValtheImpaler> there is only one clown that legitimately freaks me out
<Octavia> 14WHAT A THING TO SAY!
<ValtheImpaler> but fortunately he's dead
<Ghosties> 4Well, at least Sathi knows who Pennywise is
<Nittany_Tiger> Don't spoil It for me!
<AllisZero> Bwahaha I love this paradox
<herospirit> And pennywise isn't a clown, he's a *ShotForSpoilers*
<Luna> 11eeeyup
<Nittany_Tiger> I've never seen it.
*Sidestroke is tripleglomped apparently
<AllisZero> I'm inside a virtual machine, remote-desktop into my PC at work, which remote-desktops into my server
<Lets_Scootabuse> :s
<Ghosties> 4For the sake of suspension of disbelief, he is a clown
<Sidestroke> Lol like the topic.
<AllisZero> I should remote from the server over to my home PC and see what happens
<Sidestroke> LS?
<Luna> 11suddenly geekytalk

<Ghosties> 4Strangely enough, Pennywise spans multiple Stephen King stories I think
<RainbowDash> ...
<Nittany_Tiger> BMN selection idea!
<Sharksky> >Scootabuse
<Sharksky> Why.
<herospirit> Oh fuck. It's this clown. THIS CLOWN
<redd> helo
<SilverMane> NOT THE TICKLES
<Luna> 11DOINK
<Dermathil> LOL
<DinkyTroll> Every Scootabuse picture I've seen was 100% pointless.
<Sharksky> Hi redd. :V
<RainbowDash> First off, Scootabuse is not allowed here.
<Ghosties> 4At the least, he's considered one of the most powerful entities in his universes
<Dermathil> SHE's CAPTAIN AMERICA's DAUGHTER
<herospirit> This episode FREAKED ME THE FUCK OUT when I was little
<GGgala> FEE BS
<Nittany_Tiger> Pennywise in Shawshank Redemption. Lol.

<AllisZero> Goosebumps by any chance?
<herospirit> Chicken again!?
<Ghosties> 4And Goosebumps is also great
<Ghosties> 4But I still say Are You Afraid of the Dark is much better
<Plorf> why is scootaloo abused, anyway
<Plorf> what is the function
<Nittany_Tiger> It is?

<Ghosties> 4Now I like this idea
<Ghosties> 4Have arrows pointing in the right direction that leads to more arrows
<herospirit> MOST UNSAFE RIDE EVER
<Sketchy_Sounds> It basically arose from people asking Faust if RD would ever become like a big sister to Scoot, to which Faust said Dashie is an only child and also probably would have been ill behaved to younger siblings if she had any.
<Ghosties> 4Pointing in completely different directions

<herospirit> If this show was about a Clown who stole a child's nose on a dare, and the child followed him to get it back, we'd STILL think the clown was the villain.

<Cracky> you can synthisize O2 on mars
<GGgala> less shitty acting
<DesertRose> not yet
<ValtheImpaler> lol
<DesertRose> and not on a massive scale
<Cracky> by 10B
<herospirit> And then everyone pissed themselves
<Trixxy> mars for sure has oxygen in Total Recall
<Cracky> we have CO2 burning candles already anwyays
<Ziltoid> oh she mad
<EdwardNewgate> YOU GON DIE
<DesertRose> nope....it has ice
<GGgala> dat unreliable narration
<Trixxy> Well it gets hot
<Nittany_Tiger> Remember kids, only you can prevent forest fires!Q

<Cracky> But pressurized cities? easy as pie!
<Dermathil> mwahahahaha
<GGgala> the sensual, delectable soup
<Ziltoid> Doll episode is creepy as fuck
<User_8360> it seems as if that people never log off or uit, just put themselves in a status of sleep
<Cracky> mars also has an atmosphere made of CO2
<Tobi> Guys... Do what I do...
<DesertRose> what portal?
<GGgala> Ziltoid: the one with the dollhouse?
<Razyn> 0Can we watch Tales From the Crypt?

<Cracky> sweet
*herospirit brohoofs back
<EdwardNewgate> I loved Freakazoid
<DesertRose> :D
<Barry> 22, will be 23 this October
<EdwardNewgate> and Invader Zim
<herospirit> Edward has got taste
<Ghosties> 4shows today are too gentle
<Luna> 11Ghosties
<SilverMane> turning 20 next month
<Ghosties> 4They're too homogenized
<DesertRose> its in alpha...which means you die if you use it....usuakly
<Tobi> Hold on...
<Luna> 11Did you see the mirror ep?
<redd> what episodes are in store for season 2 though?
<Nittany_Tiger> I miss 90's cartoons.
<herospirit> Ghosties speaks the truth
<DesertRose> dunno
<Cracky> good ones
<Nittany_Tiger> 28 here.
<Ghosties> 4I probably have, Sath
<ValtheImpaler> mfw there's a horror episode in FiM
<redd> but will it blend?
<Ghosties> 4But I don't really remember it
<EdwardNewgate> Honestly, I was watching South Park with my dad at the age of 8 though so...
<Razyn> 0They're steadily getting more... Brutal?
<Luna> 11Well this is the soup ep
<Ghosties> 4Well

<Ghosties> 4Adventure Time is a great step
<SilverMane> inb4 saw
<Nittany_Tiger> Precursor to Saw.
<Barry> Wait, VtI, there is?
<herospirit> Really Val...? I honestly hope so
<ValtheImpaler> South Park isn't disturbing, it just pushes buttons of gross factors
<DesertRose> beyond that, complete secret
<redd> darn
<Nittany_Tiger> I want to play a game.
<EdwardNewgate> I actually really enjoy Regular Show
<DesertRose> its a damn good thing if you ask me
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, maybe, back in their earlier days
<redd> what r first two episodes description
<Dermathil> NUTSHOT WITH THE SNAKE
<Ghosties> 4But South Park really became about satire
<Tobi> Okay...
<ValtheImpaler> true
<Ghosties> 4And yes, that's Neve Campbell
<herospirit> South Park switches from hilarious to utter shit every other season, imo.
<Tobi> That wasn't a good Dimension...
<GGgala> "what scares you is the python between your legs!"
<DesertRose> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/season-2-episode-1-return-of-harmony.html
<ValtheImpaler> it'll be interesting to see where they were going with this mid-season finale
<DesertRose> seaon 2 stuff
<EdwardNewgate> The episode where the goldfish is killing everybody scared the shit out of me as a kid

<Cracky> It's slightly less than the consequence for using bloodless magic.
<Pizzicato> 'cause that would also work, but it's not as effective as showing everyone your shir.
<Pizzicato> t
<OctaveSauce> are all of the episodes from books?
<Nittany_Tiger> Why can't we see part 2?
<Spin> Well very much so yes
<Luna> 11because..it's not there

<EdwardNewgate> He's gonna shove some coal up her ass
<Razyn> 0*Thump*
<OctaveSauce> wow she is a pro
<Efreet> No. I'm a Knight who says Ni.

<herospirit> Santa is a Ninja Wizard, and he doesn't appreciate murder dampening the christmas cheer

<SilverMane> well shit, she's locked outside
<Pizzicato> I only know that 'cause I've been playing FFXI forever and there some spells that have the suffix Ichi, Ni, and San.
<OctaveSauce> woman
<SilverMane> a man, killing women
<GGgala> ah, so Santa is a serial killer
<Thetrollside> olol
<herospirit> I wish I didn't fucking curse so much
<Razyn> 0Well well well
<Efreet> I know most of the numbers. I remember all of them from my LOTE classes.
<Pizzicato> Parchment_Scroll: No, he's doing this http://xkcd.com/16/
<Thetrollside> KNEW IT
<EdwardNewgate> Oh hi Razyn
<OctaveSauce> of course
<SilverMane> he should have suffocated by now
<Spin> I used to be pretty into anime so I know random things in Japanese
<Efreet> Ichi, Ni, San, Shi(Yon), Go, Roku, Nana(Shichi), Hachi, Kyuu, Juu.
<Luna> 11okay that creeped me out
<Luna> 11lol
<Pizzicato> I have taste so I never really got into Japanese.
<Razyn> 0Hi Eddy. I've been here for a while~
<Parchment_Scroll> :D I love that XKCD, but I will quote anyway, Randall be damned.
<Pizzicato> Japanese animation*
<Thetrollside> OH SHI- axe is gone :O
<OctaveSauce> it's santa, come to fuck your shit up

<Efreet> Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
<GGgala> I'm telling you dude,
<GGgala> Santa Claus is gunning you down!
<SilverMane> lol[
<Pizzicato> Yea anime's rubbish and I think most people like it 'cause it has the 'anime' tag attached to it, not because they're well made films and shows.
<herospirit> SANTA CLAUSE IS COMING
<herospirit> TO TOWN.
<Razyn> 0The streaming service, Luna. it was x and some other letters
<Luna> 11xbmc

<herospirit> slow.
<Tobi> Hey...
<herospirit> Slueslow.
<Tobi> I like anime...
<Thetrollside> silver are you sure nobody can rename to trollestia? 8D
<Spin> I beg to differ I've found plenty of good shows
<Coconutswallow> Anime is just as much hit and miss as anything else.
<SilverMane> never said they couldn't
<Octavia> Pizzicato, 'if you cant say anything good, dont say anything at all', i tend to follow this within reason.
<Tobi> There are some crap ones but it was better then what was on TV...
<Thetrollside> i didnt mean you
<Thetrollside> dman it
<Pizzicato> Yeah what Coconutswallow said.
<Plorf> So guys
<Parchment_Scroll> I do not have a stats quote yet. :(
<Spin> go watch Highschool of the dead and call that rubbish shows the shit
<Plorf> Imagine the worst you've ever been in trouble
<Plorf> And look at this
<Plorf> http://i.imgur.com/87LHd.jpg
<Pizzicato> But there's a huge contingent of people who like anime just 'cause it's from Japan.
<Trollestia> drat, it;s claimed
<GGgala> Daz it!
<Trollestia> nick Silvermane
<OctaveSauce> FINISH HIM!
<Pizzicato> Oh, oh Plorf. That looks brutal.
<Octavia> someone accidentally nasa
<Coconutswallow> Well there are those. But there's also a lot of people who like things cause they have ponies in them....
<Tobi> I would rather see Luffy punch the crap out of a SeaKing then watch a fat guy eat on TV...
<herospirit> -->Don't turn your back on the body
<Spin> so hate those people not the show
<Luna> 11pro tip ^
