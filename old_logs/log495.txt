<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original script had a much darker ending. After Stansfield shoots Leon, Mathilda performs the grenade ring trick and opens her jacket to reveal the live grenades. It was changed by Luc Besson, fearing that the audience would not accept Mathilda's transformation from innocent girl to crazed juvenile killer. Besson had never intended such a transformation for
<Silverscreen> 1,11the character.

<Ponies47> DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMED!
<Kandarihu> Yeah. When some of us are lagged but I'm not, it something the mods can fix by turning down the bitrate. When I get lag on my awesome ISP, it usually means it's a problem with the streaming service.
<pony_2949> i had no stream issues at all, not even a single lag during whole movie
<derpy_pony> no panic! all rumours about a radiation leak are lies!
<CCCP> sergio_scriptor: oh cool! :D

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah i was hoping for the Monty Python Intermission music lol

<SaneSurge> :3 Derpy

<SlurryMoon> 3Hello everypony! We have five new bronies in need of help. We’re hoping to raise $2500 collectively for them, so please come by and help these great people out.
<SlurryMoon> 3First up we have Krill from Ask Queen Chrysalis. Krill recently lost her job, can’t afford internet, and is in danger of having nowhere to go.
<SlurryMoon> 3Next we have TJ Carson of Ask Pirate Dash. He lost his job a month ago and is currently living on unemployment. He has a wife and 3 year old child and really needs the help.
<SlurryMoon> 3Bitter Frost’s mod (link to mod blog) was also fired unexpectedly. She doesn’t have a permanent place to stay and currently only making money off of commissions, which isn’t enough to live on.
<SlurryMoon> 3Then we have FlavinBagel of Ask Gamer Ponies who was also fired and needs money for rent next month. He is currently unemployed and looking for work.
<SlurryMoon> 3Finally, Leigh of Ask Fizzy is behind on bills is and can barely support herself and her fiancé. All of these are really great people and it would be awesome if we could help them all out.
<SlurryMoon> 3We will be streaming all week starting on June 9th at 6 PM CDT and ending on the 15th at 6 PM CDT. Get ready to have some fun and contribute to a good cause!
<SlurryMoon> 3For this fundraiser, the ones you are donating to: Ask Queen Chrysalis, Ask Bitter Frost, Ask Pirate Dash, Ask Gamer Ponies, and Ask Fizzy’s blog authors, will be giving out commissions to the five people who donate the most. They’re only doing one commission each and you must be in chat for when we announce the winners this coming Friday at the end of the event if you want a chance
<SlurryMoon> 3to win. Highest donor gets first pick of artist and so on. So, keep donating for a chance to win and help out a good cause!
<SlurryMoon> 3And not to mention, besides our wonderful blog artists, there will be some more special guests making an appearance for your entertainment. We will have Bree Faith (voice actor of Pinkie in the Epic Cupcake Time series), ROBCakeran53 (author of My Little Dashie), the staff of Everypony Sings, and Saberspark. So come by, watch some streams with our guests, have fun, and remember to donate
<junh1024-XD> my system says my i3 has got 4 cores, even though it's only got two real cores irl.
<SlurryMoon> 3to a good cause! Thanks!

<Lighty> 06still, appriciated :3
<Silverscreen> 1,11I would like to add that the user of Ask Berry Punch/Ask Ruby Pinch/Ask Colgate has recently suffered some run of bad luck as well. They aren't a part of BronyFunds, but they deserve some love as well.

<Very_Silly_Filly> Britain is a drag for decent money atm.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know you want it, so that's why I put it up there.
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: then you don't owe them any loyalty.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> well im gonna play MGS cya in abit everypony CRAB BATTLE!!

<Very_Silly_Filly> I love how I always manage to sneak one last message before they mute us
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The US only seems to help the rich and powerful.

<Judge_Holden> Nittany_Discord: well the UK aint much better at the moment
<alexxm> bye Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Alchemist> Nittany_Discord: whatever you do, dont go to Hungary :)
*FlareChaser is moving to the UK
<Biglaw> Nittany_Discord Canada has free health care!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I could afford it, I would be headed to Denmark or Sweeden.
<Very_Silly_Filly> You can at least live on Benefits in England
<Michael> reality is cruel :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*Sweden
<Judge_Holden> Why dont we all move to Australia?
<FlareChaser> Nittany_Discord: wait, come to Canada :|
<Ponies47> Walks back away Silverscreen
<Meanwhile> Very_Silly_Filly: Which still sucks.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Judge_Holden: It's censored
<PONY> I want to move to Canada or UK... Only thing I need is a job.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I heard Canada was corrupt as well.
<FlareChaser> Silverscreen: is there any Canadian mods? :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Meanwhile: Yeah, but wer're still holding out fine
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: seems that way, like they NEED help
<Silverscreen> 1,11I honestly want to move over to the UK. At least they aren't f*cking pansies when it comes to homosexuality.
<Biglaw> PONY Plenty of opportunity in Canada
<Judge_Holden> Very_Silly_Filly: Crap, forgot that.... ok, what about New Zealand?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I suggest Canada
<Kandarihu> Good things are happening in America. I'm not sure how long it'll take before you see it. But I'd advise you to stay in America. And keep on not depending on the government.
<FlareChaser> Nittany_Discord: only in Alberta :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> Dunno.
<diddutz|triestosleep> We need more richfags in the brony community
<Bjornfot> We've had gay marriage and full LGBT equality since like 2009.
<otakon> Biglaw: if your Canadian, otherwise you gotta marry
<sergio_scriptor> FalreChaser: im european (from portugal) and let me tell you stay the hay away from here,all the countrys are falling with the european economic crisis :( you would be better of in australia
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: like how? non homophobes or something? i dont like homophobes
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'd say discover an island and all bronies live epeacefully on it
<FlareChaser> otakon: you're*
<PONY> Biglaw: that is my goal, I've been going through Immigarition stuff lately...
<Wrek> 05heck even the dept scrub program here gives enough money for house food and basic clothing Bjornfot: we sure can laugh ourselves lucky
<Very_Silly_Filly> If I ever had the money, I would just live on an island
<otakon> Judge_Holden: NO, the envirionmenta AND the flora/fauna want to kill us all
<FlareChaser> :3
<Bronysith> Very_Silly_Filly: id just make a portal to equestria
<Hrafn> yeah, Sweden is pretty good when it comes to gay rights :3
<Bjornfot> yeah Wrek, but then we do also have the highest taxes in the world
<Biglaw> PONY Well I wish you the best of luck, and that you succeed
<Silverscreen> 1,11The US is full of homophobes, and even worse yet, they have power in government.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The #1 thing that broke the straw was voluntary ISP snooping. I hate how our attempts to fight for internet freedom are for not when those seeking to control can buy their way around laws.
<otakon> Hrafn: yay Sweden!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Britain treats gays like they do normal people
<Judge_Holden> otakon: Hmmm, good point. In that case why not New Zealand?
*MahBoi777 goes to Canada
<Very_Silly_Filly> In theory anyway :P
<RyunosukeKnT> Silverscreen: I oppose that statement
<otakon> Silverscreen: buck the homophobes, assholes.
<PONY> LOL
<otakon> lol
<SaneSurge> :O
<otakon> the hell?
<desertman2> Nice video
<Michael> dun dun dunnnn
<sergio_scriptor> Silverscreen : " Vote a gay president in 2084"
<ace> lol
<Biglaw> Canada is best pony
<ace> :O
<FlareChaser> There is no Canadian mods?! :'(
<otakon> FlareChaser: well, Dermathil is Canadian
<Ponies47> BRB gonna go get some popcorn
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RIAA: SOPA and PIPA defeated? Oh well. We paid the ISPs to snoop traffic anyway.
<otakon> but he's not a mod
<PONY> Biglaw: I'm in no hurry, but Canada does seem one of the places I want to live in for few years
<Litwick> Meh, at least Canada has universal health care, doesn't revolve solely on religion, and has legalized gay marriage, and given them equality rights. Unlike America.
<otakon> brb need a drink
<Michael> now b movie :$
<MysticLugia> 12well, I´m sure I would have gotten a better laptop with this price right?
<FlareChaser> I MUST FIND PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN ALBERTA...yes...I must find them..mwahahaha...
<Biglaw> PONY Canada IS one of the most Diverse coutries in the world! *and the 2nd largest*
<RyunosukeKnT> hopefully the movie wont derp
<Kandarihu> Universal health care isn't a good thing. It comes at the price of huge taxes.
<otakon> Litwick: ah, good old empirical America where if you don't have it you'll never have it.
<Vordox> Let's see how the stream goes with Veemi. <<.
<Alchemist> Hungary also has universal healthcare but I would rather chop my leg off than go to a hospital...
<PONY> Biglaw: I know.
<sergio_scriptor> currently the only real habitable country in europe that its not in economic crysis is switzerland
<Lighty> 06possibly, but the powerhouses from now start above 550? i think
<RyunosukeKnT> that sub
<otakon> Kandarihu: we've already got huge taxes on people who can't afford it while the filthy rich pay the lowest they have in decades
<FlareChaser> if someone does move to Canada please move to Alberta, its lonely here :'(
<Litwick> Like seriously, half the states in America legalize horse fucking, but can't comprehend why 2 men or women can marry because of a "5000 year old book" that's pretty much shit plastered on paper.
<alexxm> winning
<Silverscreen> 1,11@Nittany_Discord: Then they are sued for violating the privacy rights agreement that are part of the deal when you click "I agree to the terms and conditions"
<otakon> sergio_scriptor: all the swiss banks obviously
<PONY> Biglaw: UK would be nice too, but the job situation is bad.
<Airpuff> Let the games.. begin!
<Judge_Holden> GUIZ I KNOW!! We all move to FINLAND!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> charlie sheen
<FlareChaser> I swear, I'm the only Brony in my town.
<Litwick> Now that I've got that out of the way, it's sheen time.
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: then again the hgih taxes arent a problem once the universal healthcare and otehr universal things get into practice
<otakon> Judge_Holden: sounds good
<twilight_sprinkle> i didnt know he was in this
<Michael> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Those things are quite one-sided Silver.
<SaneSurge> Was there a part one to Hot Shots? :D
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Ok, let's stop with the religious and political debate before it becomes a flame war
<Silverscreen> 1,11good idea.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Agreed.
<Wrek> 05aaw but iw as having fun
<otakon> kirzstryfe: it's not, it's finances. but good idea
<Vordox> Auup
<Ghosties> 04Let's just enjoy the movie, shall we?
<desertman2> Yes, there was
<Michael> sup
<Judge_Holden> aye, the Sheen transcends mere politics and nationality
<Biglaw> kirzstryfe I'm liking the colurs
<otakon> brb
<PONY> kirzstryfe: I've been quiet this time
<Yokupony> agreed
<Biglaw> colours*
<Vordox> I HAVEN*T LAGGED YET! I AM HAPPY!
<Silverscreen> 1,11I love this movie. :D
<Kandarihu> The upper class are the ones who pay the greatest proportion of their own income in taxes, though. We wouldn't have an employment problem if the rich actually were charged fairly.
<RyunosukeKnT> that iraqi dictator
<Alchemist> ahh LLoyd Bridges. Boy I loved his movies :D
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Let's hope the Trivia is awesome fun as well XD
<MysticLugia> 12well, I wasn´t allowed to buy on over 400
<FlareChaser> kirzstryfe: we were talking religious? I honestly didnt see any religious speak...

<SaneSurge> HMMM who might this dictator be? :D

<sergio_scriptor> dem latin gameshows
<RyunosukeKnT> that beer
<Judge_Holden> what i find so heartbreaking is that this type of Spoof is dead now... al that remains is the fucking Zeltzberg shite
<RyunosukeKnT> hungry nomad :)
<twilight_sprinkle> i like this more than strike commando
<Ponies47> Biglaw: Popcorn is never complete without butter :(
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: even if they have a high income and even greater tax, the "ricH" would still have more than enough to live on. its a matter of greed
<sergio_scriptor> Judge_holden : today its all crappy parodies like epic movie :(
<Biglaw> Ponies47 agreed
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Saddam's refrigerator contains items such as: Hungry Nomad (Hungry Man) Microwavable Milk carton advertising "2% Camel Milk", "Olde Iraqi Beer" and "Falafel Helper". When Saddam makes a sandwich he seals it with, not Saran Wrap, but "Saharanrap".
<Vordox> XD
<Biglaw> wow

<Michael> is epic
<Kandarihu> I like to pick One Piece Movie 10 for A movie and for the B movie, it's a somewhat trollish surprise. Nothing offensive, though.

<sagas> yay for cheesey action movie sequence!
<icybeauti> targets...
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the sequence which displays an on-screen body count tally, the movie boasts an ostensibly higher number of deaths than Robocop (among other famous shoot'em ups). Miguel Ferrer, who plays Harbinger in this movie, also starred in Robocop , and ended up 1 out that film's 30 strong body count. Actual body count is 114, which is still more than Total Recall and
<Silverscreen> 1,11Robocop combined.

<Pinkies4thWall> GarrettBrony: Yesterday was PONYDAY. Today it is PONYDAY
<GarrettBrony> Tuesday is Email Fellow Bronies Day
<WallDives> and thus the time loop begins again...
<RyunosukeKnT> the moral of this story is this: Yesterday is History; Tommorow is a Mystery; but today is a gift, that is why it's called the present :)
<Litwick> IT SOUNDS LIKE A FUCKING WAR ZONE WHERE I AM
<Ghosties> 04NO YOU FOOL

<otakon> Big_Macintosh_1992: she IS the Element of Magic you know.
<NommyDash> Nittany_Discord: Yeah, like the friendship scrolls system.
<otakon> dat hoof to the mouth
<cachi01> RyunosukeKnT: nooo the moral of this is time travel can buck your day. but nice message :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Ghosties: but then the world would explode, cause then nothing wouldve made twilight end up with the time spell
<EggWhite> Now we watch the episode over and over again in an infinite loop :)
<Big_Macintosh_1992> otakon: i know... still
*Pinkies4thWall calms Ghosties down and gives him ice cream
<otakon> STILL looks awkward

<Eddmario> Nyria: Can someone translate this to our language?
<NullRadix> RainbowcrashNBurn: NSMB:U now has online multiplayer! bad news, its completely random and you can't turn it off (ala Dragon Souls if I recall the game correctly)
<Viri> 14why am I still awake

<RainbowcrashNBurn> VenHur96: the wii U controller has built in mic i think
<NullRadix> as I recall, I was told in Dragon Souls people randomly join your game, and mess with you. It's always on DRM and you can't turn it off so the game is unplayable for new players
<sagas>
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!

<Ponies47> OK WHAT I ALL IS TALK ABOUT A LYRA PLUSHIE!?!
<d3rb> Saturn: that link :D
<Flutters> no. i'm too lazy to move from my position
<sagas> Saturn: Only because it resulted in many humorous things and showed we dont hate
<Aeina> so what's with the lyra plushie? Did I miss some context?
<d3rb> the mugger one is the best
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: have u seen it?

<MahBoi777> I won't
<Critchleyb> saturn: When and if john de lancie confirms hes coming to buck he'll be in that 20% cooler buffet right? ^.^
<RainbowcrashNBurn> the whole plushie thing annoyed me, lyra is one of my, (if not THE) favorite background ponie(s) for me
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What's the deal with the Lyra plushie?
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: It can be used for ANYTHING
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: you'll just have to look it up lol
<Simon> oh gawd not THE lyra plushie
<sagas> SuperBrony64: Big ordeal about a plushie with a hole in its but intended for a penis.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> the use the maker clearly intended sickened me :(
<otakon> SuperBrony64: no idea to be honest
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Fine :|
<The_Si> It's an impractical oven mitt.
<otakon> sagas: please tell me that this is not a real thing....
<Flutters> I's a uni
<Simon> otakon: it's real
<sagas> otakon: It is
<Saturn> 08,01Critchleyb: nope
<Flutters> its a horn cozy
<RainbowcrashNBurn> otakon: sadly, it is
<Aeina> did someone actually make one? or is it just drawings?
<Critchleyb> saturn: :'(
<MahBoi777> there ya go, it's an oven mitt lol
<otakon> :( Oh God why....
<Saturn> 08,01when we announce him officially (once we have confirmation of some other things) we'll make that clear on the site
*Big_Macintosh_1992 just learned about this "lyra plushie" and wishes he hadn't
<Critchleyb> alright coolio
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> Hey ask me a best pony question guys
<CCCP> Big_Macintosh_1992: LOL
<Saturn> 08,01all the 20% Cooler tickets are sold now anyway
<sagas> SuperBrony64: Non-bronies found out about it and tried to use it as fuel to hate us. Bronies didnt really give a fuck and took it rather humerously
<Critchleyb> yeh
*MahBoi777 pats Big_Macintosh_1992 on the back
<Saturn> 08,01so it's not like we're suddenly changing something
<Critchleyb> naro, just wondered
*Randomnerd facepalms at the Lyra Plushie.
<CupcakeWarrior> I would buy a SuperBrony64 plushie, but without the hole of course :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Stylish~
<Critchleyb> narp even
<sagas> Its not really a big deal, Big_Macintosh_1992
<PartyCannon> DAT BATTLE
<Flutters> WE MEET AT LAST
<Litwick> I'm actually kind of indifferent to the Lyra plushie.
<Simon> Lyra Plushie, if you think about it, it can be funny
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm tired of this game now :3
<otakon> OH DEAR GOD WHY IS THAT A REAL THING?!
<Randomnerd> SuperBrony64: What do you think about the Wii U?
<CrimsonPhoenix> WHAT
<sagas> Who really cares about the plushie. To each their own
<Big_Macintosh_1992> sagas: i know.... just not what i was expecting
<Simon> otakon: it just happens
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tired of Mario?
<Randomnerd> otakon: I know!
<Saturn> 08,01Litwick: if people want to think of ponies sexually, that's their own business. personally, i don't see anythign wrong with it.
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> big mac is that you its moopy dude
<otakon> SuperBrony64: but you could have WON
<sagas> SuperBrony64: :D
<PartyCannon> SB Translation: RAGE QUIT :3
<RainbowcrashNBurn> sagas: what the non-bronies forgot, is that every fanbase has people like that, whether people like it or not
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Randomnerd: Love it ^_^
<d3rb> its not funnt, its hillarious
<SaneSurge> Play something else! :D
<Ponies47> O_O OK NOW I KNOW WHY WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.
<Aeina> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: I would totally buy you an Allie Way plushie
<Flutters> Dat windows error
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowcrashNBurn: exactly
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: yea lol
<sagas> To each their own
<Aeina> There's a R34 of everything, no exceptions
<otakon> Saturn: well, except its CLEARLY not meant for that and someone twists it into being that.
<Saturn> 08,01i bed even homestuck...
<Saturn> 08,01*bet
<Simon> Aeina: you dun say
<Litwick> Litwick: I said indifferent. Meaning I don't honestly CARE about the Lyra plush.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I LIEK ALLIE WAY :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> of course even homestuck
<Randomnerd> homstuck has buckets, I'm sure.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02And Derpy too :3
<otakon> Anyway
<SaneSurge> :O King of the Hill time?
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: people do that with *everything*, though
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Dats (squee) up.
<otakon> LET US MOVE ON
<NullRadix> Why does everything explode?
<sagas> otakon: It is meant for that. It said so in the sellers description
<otakon> Saturn: they shouldn't
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: why not?
<SaneSurge> SuperBrony64: Derpy <3
<Randomnerd> I AM EXCITED FOR THE WII U
<SuperBrony64> 11,02ME TOO :D
<Derpy_H> yay :3
<VenHur96> I was washing the dish of my lunch, then I founded out NSMB Wii is over. aw well.
<otakon> sagas: okay, I meant Ponies IN GENERAL. I know THAT thing was meant as a .........doll.
<Randomnerd> It promises many ways to pass the time with frineds!
<PartyCannon> Randomnerd IKR?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://imgur.com/gallery/2i6oJ
<Simon> otakon: the world just happens, you can't control it
<Randomnerd> Friends you have magical friendships with.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i should put down the chainsaw
<PartyCannon> I've already got some cash saved for it
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm excited for, but skeptical of Wii U to be honest.
<otakon> Simon: true
<Saturn> 08,01because you are stumped.
<GabeMoist> My goodness Saturn, I never knew the Lyra plushie was so useful
<sagas> otakon: Oh. Well to each their own. As long as they arent hurting anyone, let them have their plushie
<Derpy_H> Derpy_Hooves you must DIE
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: same here, only bit im disappointed in is *shudder* Nintendoland, but thats clearly the wii sports of Wii U
<MahBoi777> not sure what to think of the Wii U
<SaneSurge> Eeyup
<GabeMoist> I'm gonna buy one now
<Saturn> 08,01GabeMoist: ****THE MORE YOU KNOW
<CupcakeWarrior> MahBoi777: Its awesome
<Saturn> 08,01hey derpster
<otakon> Saturn: I'm sorry, I don't really mind the fanart that impedes on that territory bc I don't go looking at it. But an ACTUAL plushie made for this is just...........too far.
<Critchleyb> Your just sombody that i used to know...
<Randomnerd> Everlasting_Joy: It will probably be lousy at first, since it will have too few games.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: why?
<Simon> otakon: Nothing is always too far
<sagas> otakon: Like I said, to each their own
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> Hey guys do you think i should chug this root beer thats sitting by me over here?
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: why should you care what people do in their bedrooms to dolls?
<SaneSurge> 12 MILES AN HOUR? :O
<VenHur96> Never watched King of The Hill before.
<Everlasting_Joy> Randomnerd: It's not the short time I'm worried about.
<Flutters> HAHA
<Saturn> 08,01it doesn't harm anyone, so let them have their fun
<MahBoi777> CupcakeWarrior: have they said what it would cost yet?
<CupcakeWarrior> Nope
<otakon> Saturn: I don't care what they do, just DON'T FRIGGIN TELL ME ABOUT IT. I don't ask for the info, so DON'T GIVE IT TO ME.
<Saturn> 08,01so long asthey don't rub it in our faces
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> should i do it?
<MahBoi777> ah
<killerpony7733> Saturn agreed
<Saturn> 08,01figurative, or literally
<ScootaChicken> If otakon cared about the shit I do in the comfort of my own bedroom, he would probably hug me.
<drfsupercenter> 03http://imgur.com/gallery/AG90B
<Flutters> what is this
<otakon> ScootaChicken: huh?
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> give me a yes or no
<Saturn> 08,01ScootaChicken: i want an otakon hug too :(
<MahBoi777> oh no he didn't!
<sagas> otakon: Well others found out about it and spread it. Not the seller. Blame them
*otakon hugs Saturn "There"
<Critchleyb> i want muffins
<otakon> sagas: aye
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> if i should chug this root beer
<Derpy_Hooves> i LOVE this episode
<otakon> OH GOD THIS EP
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: as i say, no-one's rubbing it in your face
<otakon> Derpy_Hooves: me too
<otakon> Saturn: yh good point
<Flutters> well i'm going elsewhere. bye
<Saturn> 08,01because that would be kinda messy
<otakon> 5th or 8th time and yet SHE'S A TEACHER.
<Derpy_Hooves> but i HATE peggy
<otakon> brb need a sammich
<MahBoi777> mah back
<otakon> Derpy_Hooves: I think she's a great character
<sagas> Derpy_Hooves: Why do you have to hate anyone?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> im happy that ACIII is coming to Wii U, although the reason why is a bit hard to put into words :S
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> ok here i go no more bets
<Flutters> bye guys
<MahBoi777> Derpy_Hooves: u are not alone
<otakon> I'LL TAKE THE JUNK FOOD!
<Derpy_Hooves> he dissed the lawn O.O
<Randomnerd> Mmmm junk food.
<sagas> I could never loose a hundred pounds
<Litwick> :D
<otakon> you NEVER insult a Texan's yard
<Randomnerd> sagas: I'm trying to lose 15 -_-
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> YEEAAAAHHH i did it
<Randomnerd> 100 pounds would kill me.
<Everlasting_Joy> If I lost 100 pounds, I'd be loosing organ mass as well.
<FillyFlam> "Wednesday" is a freaking weird word.
<Aeina> So I didn't really follow E3 (and I haven't for quite a few years)... is the Wii U intended to be their next console generation or some sort of peripheral?
<sagas> Randomnerd: 15 isnt that hard! You can do it!
<Randomnerd> sagas: thank you :)
<otakon> sagas: I'd be in my supposed weight range if I did, but I put NO faith in BMI bullshit
<MahBoi777> Everlasting_Joy: Lol
<Randomnerd> FillyFlam: It comes from "Wotan's Day"
<Derpy_Hooves> otakon that's a false stereotype about us texan's, our BIGGEST stereotype is: "Everyone from texas wears a cowboy hat"
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Aeina: console, huge grahpical upgrade from existing Wii
<otakon> he has NO ass
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> hey admim i just chuged the whole root beer here
<Big_Macintosh_1992> lol
<Ponies47> I'm gonna go take a shower. BRB :)
<CCCP> dat ass
<SaneSurge> otakon: do you know any Texans? :D
<CupcakeWarrior> dat plot
<otakon> Derpy_Hooves: oh
<Litwick> To quote Jitterbug Jive "HE CAN'T SHIT!"
<otakon> SaneSurge: Derpy_Hooves is a texan
<xmasskills> ewww
<sagas> otakon: I can agree with that. I have a high BMI, but im very muscular
<Randomnerd> otakon: I know a Texan lady. she was awesome :)
<Aeina> ah, and I gathered from the online reactions to E3 that MS and Sony didn't announce anything of much note, ok :P
<otakon> sagas: I'm fairly muscular
<Shamroc> BEER GUT
<SaneSurge> BEER
<otakon> sagas: I'm stout
<Randomnerd> She's a mortician, which is kinda weird.
<FillyFlam> Randomnerd: I know. But it's one of those words where if you say it a thousand times really slowly, you're just like "...wut"
<ScootaChicken> Derpy_Hooves: Don't mind otakon, he's a bit racist to everyone.
<MahBoi777> LOL
<otakon> brb need a sammich
<sagas> Yes, shoes are fake feet
<Randomnerd> It's a misunderstood job, like practicing Law.
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> hey guys whens the broadcast going to start we have been sitting and chating for like a minute
<Derpy_Hooves> Scootachicken: i really dont care, im not as stuck up ass most texans are ..>
<sagas> silicone ass implants
<Derpy_Hooves> as*
<Big_Macintosh_1992> lol
<MahBoi777> balance things out
<Randomnerd> What part are you from, Derpy_Hooves ?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Aeina: MS announced something that is clearly a rippoff of the wii U controller, and Sony announce a smash bros ripoff
<Derpy_Hooves> San Antonio
<Derpy_Hooves> central texas
<Randomnerd> I think most big states have bad reputations as being stuck up.
<SaneSurge> BIG BUTT :D
<Randomnerd> California, NY and Texas.
<sagas> HANK HAS A FAT ASS!
<Randomnerd> Derpy_Hooves: The lady I knew was from that area, German and Mexican.
<sagas> Ha @aol.com :D
<MahBoi777> ahhhh
<SaxyPretender> 0,14wait, people think of NY as stuck up?
<sagas> Well ill be dipped
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I thought our schtick was we're rude and pushy
<Randomnerd> SaxyPretender: Look up "Newt Gingrich Subways"
<ScootaChicken> SaxyPretender: I thought your shtick was that you said 'Cwoafee'
<sagas> its deflated
<Derpy_Hooves> i mean, yeah our biggest stereotype is :Everyone from texas wears a cowboy hat", but unless the rodeo is going on, you will never see me wearing a cowboy hat >.>

*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts SaxyPretender
<SaxyPretender> 0,14o_o
<SaneSurge> ASS
<Derpy_Hooves> but that stereotype is somewhat true
<sagas> Derpy_Hooves: The fact that youde wear them anytime says enough
<Marx> :D
<xmasskills> buttboobies
<Aeina> I think that's only in the media, when they want to portray someone from texas
<sagas> is this Maid Hour?! :)
<Derpy_Hooves> i mean if you go to west texas, litterally EVERYONE is dressed as a cowboy
<sagas> Oh damn

<sagas> Wood Chips instead of grass?! :O
<CCCP> Derpy_Hooves: thats cool :P
<MahBoi777> propane emergency??
<sagas> Do not light any matches
<Randomnerd> The stereotype about New Yorkers makes even less sense, as half of the people in the state are not from NYC.
<Derpy_Hooves> so yea, in west texas, that sterotype is 100% true, which makes me feel glad im in central texas
<MahBoi777> I've only been to Arlington
<sagas> Derpy_Hooves: Texas is still Texas
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> sup every pony
<sagas> Hobbyists?

<Chains> OC?
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> i watch it sometimes
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, but for a keyboard to cuase that?
<nickstr> no power going to it at all
<FlareChaser> Honestly, this animation is wasted on shomething like this, it could be used for something more action-y.
<sagas> Ponies47: Show?
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<kirzstryfe> 8,6if requests were being taken, we'd let everyone know
<DaringDude> Sumerpan ish best hero Omiright?
<MahBoi777> so many animes, lol I love it
<Chains> I have an OC!
<EggWhite> Ok I was just playing Magicka for the #bronyfunds stream.
<drfsupercenter> 03I think what happened was it put my computer in some sort of hybrid sleep mode, and the only way I could get out of it was to hit reset
<FlareChaser> me too! :D
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> just put it on real qick
<drfsupercenter> 03but even then, reset button shouldn't mess with CMOS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01DaringDude: Yes.

<otakon> pony_3xxMoopyxx: don't push mods to do something, they do this as basically a favor.
<HoboAddiction> I think this show is a little too crazy, even for me.
<MahBoi777> DaringDude: of course Lol
<RainbowcrashNBurn> WHY does he still not have his shirt?
<nickstr> it might have been something else
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol

<FlareChaser> http://flarechaser.deviantart.com/ to victory!
<drfsupercenter> 03as I'm in the middle of writing a paper
<Avis> WHY would you even touch something with power going still, it makes me afraid of hurting it possibly
<drfsupercenter> 03and would have been pissed if it erased it
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> ok sorry jeeze
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03Avis I used to be a noob and fried my PSU
<drfsupercenter> 03when I was like 12
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought it was fun to spin the PSU fan with a paper clip
<Avis> Ohhhh
<Avis> Ok
<nickstr> sometimes its necessary for performing tests
<drfsupercenter> 03until I touched the metal and it fried
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<nickstr> but there are specific points for doing so
<DaringDude> At first i thought she had put bOmbs under their seats XD
<otakon> pony_3xxMoopyxx: yeah, never make demands of people that do this for free.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, I've tested PSUs
<MahBoi777> BOMBZ?
<MahBoi777> u want it?
<EggWhite> Is Angel Beats good? I haven't had the chance to watch it.

<sagas> im kina lost...
<DaringDude> www.bronystate.cOm
<HoboAddiction> sagas: don't know, don't want to know :P

<DaringDude> mfw i first tried hot cheetos
<otakon> Shizuka: and THAT explains it. MIDDLE OF THE SERIES MADNESS.

<Bronysith> ty Ponies47
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: i've never heard of it
<RyunosukeKnT> that looks yummy
<otakon> when death isn't a issue it always drops down to pain
<Pistols> Anypony see me on the table?
<Saturn> 08,01last anime i streamed was that one with the Grim Reaper
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i want more epic slapstick causing flying chairs
*MahBoi777 grabs a pistol and eats it
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: but..but..you downloaded it for weeks, and then streamed the first ep, you were busy preparing for exams at the time
<sagas> Saturn: Which one?
<otakon> RainbowcrashNBurn: I think it comes in waves
<Shizuka> 13it gets better
<nickstr> those require 40 watts of power to iluminate
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: i don't think i did
<Shizuka> 13but it also gets extremely emotional
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: eh, that animes just brilliant imo :3
<FlareChaser> Saturn: ..er...I'm thinking Soul Eater.
<VenHur96> RainbowcrashNburn: I do wonder if that's an running gag in the anime?
<otakon> Shizuka: why middle ep though?
<HoboAddiction> Does it ever make any more sense?
<otakon> Shizuka: or did I miss the first eps?
<Shizuka> 13cause i streamed 1-4 before :3
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: actually, i seem to remember downloading something like that, but i don't think i even streamed it
<Purple`Prose> Can we watch Redline again?
<otakon> HoboAddiction: this is the middle of the series
<Saturn> 08,01Purple`Prose: no, we cannot
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: im so confused right now. i Know you streamed the first ep
<otakon> Purple`Prose: that's Sumica's territory
<Purple`Prose> aw...
<Chains> I think I should check my e-mail... I've been avoiding Rope...
<otakon> Saturn: don't tell him that, Sumica might decide to stream it again.
<HoboAddiction> Even so, I doubt it would even make sense if I myself made it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: shouldnt you still have it on your pc?
<superretroworld> that was pretty good
<Rope> YES YOU HAVE, Chains!
<otakon> suddenly invasion?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://imgur.com/gallery/iUYZ5

<Shizuka> 13no one reads the bottom of the screen where it tells you
<RainbowcrashNBurn> at*
<otakon> Shizuka: they switched his gun arm in that shot
<pony19124> xP
<RyunosukeKnT> Mutterguy: thats why I said kinda :)
<Shizuka> 13megatron?
<otakon> Shizuka: yeah,
<Comradinski> Quick question - when does the Care Bears show air on The Hub? Is it the 23rd?
<Shizuka> 13they tend to play a bit loose with which arm his tail is on or whether he's got the tail or a normal arm
<otakon> Dinobot? HOW?
<otakon> Shizuka: ah
<RainbowcrashNBurn> last time i saw dinobot....he sacrificed himself?
<Shamroc> otakon....I'll give you a hint....its a rifftrax
<Shizuka> 13somehow, megatron cloned dinobot
<otakon> WOW
<nickstr> nice
<Shizuka> 13he did it before, and the clone didn't have dinobot's sense of honor
<otakon> HOW do you clone a ROBOT?
<otakon> Shamroc: also, nice.
<Shizuka> 13now he's done it again but with transmetal II tech
<MahBoi777> otakon: with science
<otakon> MahBoi777: SCIENCE!
<superretroworld> Comradinski: actually i think the first episode may have already been aired
*otakon dons his labcoat
<Comradinski> Hrm

<mutterguy_> the current one lacks Dinobot's grace and humor and intelligence.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> laser vision?
<otakon> OUCH
<Shamroc> CANT TURN OF LAZER
<otakon> RainbowcrashNBurn: well he DID have eye lasers as his primary long range weapon before, this one jsut seems more powerful

<Alister> otakon: Great , I just bought Mass Effect 1 and 2. Imma tap dat *gets shot*
<Kandarihu> kirzstryfe: There is no S4 of Beast Wars. After this is S1 of Beast Machines in which they do return to Cybertron.
*Alister is dead
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> Heh i like the auto turrets with the lights on
<otakon> Alister: nice, do you have ME3 already?

<Alister> otakon: I don't care about the ending , Mass Effect 2 and 1 feel like real sci-fi stories. the 3 feels like some overdramatic JRPG story

Yes siree, Willy Wonka scared the hell out of me as a kid.

<superretroworld> nothing is best pony
<otakon> SaxyPretender: ALL THE FUNDING
<Shizuka> 13saxy... are you okay?
<GabeMoist> FUND IT WITH THE WHITE HOT FURY OF A THOUSAND WONKAS
<sonicrainboomer259> another random fact: it was SUPPOSED to be over 8000,further proving that dbzkai is loyal to the manga
<SaxyPretender> 0,14SO VERY OKAY
<SayWhat> It's the CCCP!
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> but charlie is the only onone who gets out of bed alot
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol
<otakon> sonicrainboomer259: eeyup, but over 9000 is JUST SO EPIC.
<Kencolt> Back in the day, many SF fans postulated that Willy Wonka was actually a Time Lord. Seriously. Fandom can be odd.
<Ghosties> 04Obviously Neil would be a much better Wonka than Depp and Saxy knows this
<GrimGallop> Bah, this headset is nearly dead. I'm off to see if I can find something less stupid to use for sound output.
<Stallion_of_War> That Agustus isn't that fat by today's standards
<Phase4> 00,02* SaxyPretender has kicked SaxyPretender from #bronystate (BUSTAH WOLF)
<Phase4> 00,02XD

<otakon> OH GOD
<The9001thPony> he's a spy.
<kangaroojac> what about ps2
<Litwick> SO MUCH PURPLE
<SayWhat> I think I'm gonna play Kirby Airride now
<Phase4> 00,02Violet is secretly a building
<Kencolt> It was mostly because this movie came out during Tom Baker's run-- and the eccentic clothing just seemed.
<The9001thPony> SWAG.
<sagas> I liked Depp as Wonka :(
<CK|GW2> And he was saying how I hadn't done my research about the Wii U, right?
<Shamroc> i like runts
<otakon> Kencolt: eeyup
<The9001thPony> shamroc, runts?
<Ponies47> HEY KIDS WELCOME TO THE RAINBOW FACTORY! :)
<The9001thPony> the fruity hard candys?
<Alister> YEAY
<CK|GW2> Except later in that same post, he states that the Wii U uses 4 tablet controllers
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> why is he walking so slow?
<CK|GW2> NOT SURE IF BEING TROLLED
<Shamroc> The9001thPony: the candy that looks like fruit
<sonicrainboomer259> i'm gonna go play minecraft later
<otakon> pony_3xxMoopyxx: just watch
<Midnight_Fyre> Gene Wilder=Awesome
<d3rb> 4 tablets?
<pony_3xxMoopyxx> Fine
<d3rb> i thought it was only 2?
<The9001thPony> Shamroc: That candy is awesome. :3
<Kencolt> At lleast he's using thye cane properly.
<Shizuka> 13aaaand at halfway through the movie we finally have a line from wonka
<SayWhat> Lol Cane troll
<Ghosties> 04COMBAT ROLL

<otakon> CK|GW2: this is the Rifftrax of WWATCF.
<otakon> DO A BARREL ROLL
<CK|GW2> d3rb: It is only 2. It was never 4.
<CK|GW2> >_>

<d3rb> ah....okie dokie :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14MENUDO
<AJ> |Discord|: i love the guy who played wonka
<otakon> Shizuka: Gene Wilder is best Wonka
<CK|GW2> Which is why I am wondering if this guy is trolling me or not.
<Midnight_Fyre> come to me, children
<superretroworld> gene wilder is best pony
<sub06905> Do a Wonka Roll!
<otakon> CK|GW2: he was trolling
<|Discord|> AJ: He sounds like a pedo. No offense
<fapplebloom> "Welcome to my chocolate factory" is what i say to my hookers
<Litwick> And the Pogs.
<sagas> Why out of all the people in the world are the winners white?
<superretroworld> sub06905: :D good one
<otakon> sagas: the 70's is why
<otakon> sagas: now just ENJOY THE MOVIE
<SayWhat> Do a Sweet Roll!
<Stallion_of_War> Now that I think about it... I think Wonka might actually BE a Timelord
<Stallion_of_War> That explains it!
<CK|GW2> You can't say "durr 4 tablets" and "do your research nub" in the same post, that should theoretically create a singularity of stupidity that would extinguish all life in this universe.
<Stallion_of_War> His factory is a TARDIS!
<sonicrainboomer259> who-else has seen autarch of trololo on top ten game endings by joshscorcher
<otakon> Stallion_of_War: Gene Wilder would make a great Timelord
<SayWhat> YOU'RE DED
<sagas> otakon: I was just wondering. Didnt know the 70s were so afraid of minorities
<otakon> CK|GW2: we're lucky then
<Ghosties> 04RAPTURE!
<Litwick> See, I love Gene Wilder as Wonka. AND YES, I WANT TO SEE GENE AS A TIMELORD
<Midnight_Fyre> Wonka is dead. Roll credits
<The9001thPony> lol
<Ghosties> 04Welcome to Wonka's RAPTURE!
<otakon> Litwick: too bad he's dead :(
<Randomnerd> sagas: 1) the 70s, 2) if there are kids in the developed world who can only afford one Candy Bar a year, the developing world is probably screwed.
<Litwick> otakon: He's what?
<CK|GW2> otakon: That won't stop him.
<otakon> Litwick: dead :(
<kirzstryfe> 8,6gatorland >.<
<SayWhat> The way the door opens is against fire safety regulations
<Shamroc> lol
<Litwick> otakon: Y-you're joknig right?
<otakon> I'VE BEEN TO GATORLAND
<Derpy_Hooves> welcome to gaterland~
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: I don't think he's dead
<sagas> Randomnerd: Asia and South America?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14speaking of Disneyworld, apparently my grandma told me the very first time I saw Mickey, I was in total awe, on the verge of tears
<CK|GW2> He's Gene Wilder. If given the part of a Timelord, he'd just come back to life to accept the role.
<otakon> the chilidogs there are DELICOUS
<Shizuka> 13when do we get to the rides?
<superretroworld> wonka wasnt excited when meeting charlie
<Derpy_Hooves> call me what you want, but i laughed at the chocolate tunnel scene
<VenHur96> Welcome to Willy Wonka's Wheel of DOOM!
<Alister> SayWhat: Do they have those fire regulations in Germany ?
<sagas> one creepy mother fucker
<Midnight_Fyre> Gene Wilder is still alive
<Kencolt> Remember -- the Doctor Lies. SO does Willy Wonka.
<otakon> HE IS ALIVE!
<Shamroc> HAND STOLE MAH HAT
<SayWhat> Alister: Probably
<Phase4> 00,02nothing dangerous, except all that dangerous stuff that happens later
<otakon> I AM SO GLAD TO BE WRONG!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Wonka ToS
<SayWhat> Alister: However, they're German
<Randomnerd> sagas: I mean in this wonka-world. There are people who can afford luxury items in the developing world in our world. Not enough, of course :(
<Alister> SayWhat: Pics or it didn't happen
<otakon> GENE WILDER IS ALIVE BUT RETIRED
<Nyria> Terms and conditions~
<SaxyPretender> 0,14be lucky we don't have a ToS like that =P
<The9001thPony> nothing dangerous but being sucked up a giant chocolate pipe, running out of air and dying, SEEMS LEGIT WONKA. :d
<Shizuka> 13pff
<Shizuka> 13no one reads the rules we have now
<superretroworld> this parts scary

<kangaroojac> can you pause it when he does that meme pose
<Derpy_Hooves> call me what you want, but i laughed at the chocolate tunnel scene
<superretroworld> hey guys, whats the biggest lie on the internet?

<Ponies47> Randomnerd: I LOVE LOVE LOVE CANTERLOCK! :D
<sagas> yay closet!
