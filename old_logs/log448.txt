<mario_pony> CCCP: did you finish those errands?
<CCCP> dat OmegaMetroidBrony
<Dermathil> btw guys, wasn't Canada Banned before?
<Canada> CCCP: yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like, these bugs are obviously flying around... dunno if they're just stupid or what, but it's like they wanted to "challenge accepted" and see if any of them didn't get crushed by my windshield wipers
*OmegaMetroidBrony is too socially backwards to throw parties
<CCCP> mario_pony: ummm not even close
<PinkiePieFTW> nice try omega.
<Canada> Yes. I was perma-banned.
<PinkiePieFTW> you can't get out of this.
<Canada> But now, I'm NOT! :)
<MahBoi777> mario_pony
<Dermathil> Canada: you appealed? Or is this a Proxy?
<DaringDude> wrek likes accesories :3
<PinkiePieFTW> party tiem nao.
<Dermathil> ANSWER THE QUESTION
<CCCP> mario_pony: but i did add to the picture!
<WallDives> if you are perma-banned, why are you here? that defeats the "perma" part.
<Ponies47> Ok here's a good question. WHAT IS THE BEST MOMENT OF SEASON 1 OF MLP FIM?
*OmegaMetroidBrony is hella not good at the socialising
<BlueFlare> 02wouldn't they just fly off when you went to drive away? |D
<Canada> Neither. I'm really f:Oking confused.
<mario_pony> MahBoi777

<CCCP> Canada: how did you get banned?
<Dermathil> Canada: GET OUT BEFORE THEY SEE YOU

<hen3ry> best moment of season 1? "LOVE ME!" :'(
<WallDives> its like there not being "one" in highlander, IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE!
<Dermathil> CCCP: he did shit that was warranting a permaban.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dermathil: Modern mainstream games are a joke nowadays.
<Dermathil> Ponies47: people need to know more about that topic. That game needs to be punished for using such insulting tactics.
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: I couldn't take more than 10 seconds of that video
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord: DON'T YOU SEE THE ANGLES THEY USED
*Gunthler agrees with Nittany_Discord
<Ponies47> Dermathil; What?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Ubishit is a horrible publisher anyway.
<Dermathil> Ponies47: watch the video.
<Ponies47> Dermathil: Nope.avi
<DaringDude> Nittany_Discord: but but assasins creed :'(
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: rage, RAGE FOR ME! I WISH TO FEEL YOUR ANGER!
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord: Ubisoft isn't a horrible Publisher. Activision and EA are. Ubisoft is better than them.
*DeathStar hugs Ponies47 for no aparent reason
*otakon feeds off of Nittany_Discord's anger
<twilight_sprinkler> hey otakon what movie is this
*Gunthler noms DeathStar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubishit invented the worst DRM in history.
<Saturn> 08,01i love to see you grin!
<Dermathil> Ponies47: just do it. It won't kill you.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: shaddup, that joke is old
<Ponies47> Hugs DeathStar back
<Saturn> 08,01i love to see you beam!
<Ponies47> Dermathil: Nope.avi
<Gunthler> Saturn: <3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's enough reason for me to hate them.
<otakon> Saturn: how is your Smile coming along?
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: never heard of that movie
<flutter_spin> Come on every pony smile smile smile
<Saturn> 08,01the corners of your mouth turned up, is always pinkie's dream!

<Gunthler> Saturn:
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: maybe on thursday
*SunderlandPony89 feeds off of otakon's rage
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft still likes it.
<Gunthler> Saturn: Dat Smile song :D
<WallDives> all I'm going to say is on disc DLC is garbage, and thats my 2 cents.
<hen3ry> My cauldron is preheated and I have you.... wait, wrong sing.
<otakon> Dermathil: eeyup, nothing like a game people have been pining for for 4 years and they can't play it half the time
<Saturn> 08,01Gunthler: http://test.du.cx/smilething.mp3
<Dermathil> Ubisoft doesn't PREVENT you from playing your single player if the SERVERS ARE FULL
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Modern mainstream games suck anyway.
<Dermathil> Ubisoft is not that harsh.
<Midnight_Tempest> cant we just say that all publishers are evil and shit, and get on with something else more interesting?
<Dermathil> THose who still say that and praise Diablo 3 are hypocrites.
*DaringDude wubs assasins creed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not all of them are bad.
<flutter_spin> Yeah. I guess I still have 2 hours I can go back to my fic
<SunderlandPony89> Nittany_Discord: I was gonna say...
<DeathStar> Saturn: it's so pretty
<Gunthler> Saturn: Whats all this then? :d
<Saturn> 08,01Gunthler: i was messing around with my field recorder
<Midnight_Tempest> whatever... im not getting into this...
<flutter_spin> I just wish I didn't spend the entire day out. I only had time to watch Season 4 reboot and then I had to leave again
<Dermathil> YES PUTLOCKER GAME OF THRONES IS UP. BYE ALL!!!!!
<WallDives> So, dat B/W 2.
*DeathStar dances on Midnight_Tempest s head
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just the big ones that get away with large amounts of consumer abuse.
<flutter_spin> Maybe I should see the new episode of Legend of Korra online
<SunderlandPony89> And the smaller ones tend to be idiots
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord: none gets away under my watchful eye.
<SunderlandPony89> Case in point: THQ
<Midnight_Tempest> *sighs*...
<MahBoi777> flutter_spin: splendid idea
*Dermathil punches SunderlandPony89
<DaringDude> will there b more streaming?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01THQ. EA. Sony. Activision.
<Dermathil> HOW DARE YOU INSULT THQ
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Everytime I have to leave it's either sleep of being called upon as the seapony who lifts heavy things
<Dermathil> THQ IS GOOD GUYS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01THQ uses on-disc DLC.
<Dermathil> THQ IS GOING BANKRUPT BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING GOOD STUFF.

<Gunthler> Scoot-Scootaloo: I don't get it 6_9
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That strummed a few heartstrings
<otakon> Dermathil: I must admit that chick is attractive however
<Dermathil> SunderlandPony89: That was a bad commercial move, I admit. Doesn't change that THEY HOLD THE DARKSIDERS FRANCHISE AND THE WARHAMMER 40K LISENCE
<DeathStar> Scoot-Scootaloo: dat reference :D
*DaringDude liks Scoot-Scootaloo's link

<Midnight_Tempest> THQ is still a shit company... doesnt matter if they make Warhammer 40k...

*Scoot-Scootaloo loves Astronomy

<DaringDude> SPACE MARINES!
<WallDives> Om: I see.

<Dermathil> Saints Row 3 is not a good game.
<DeathStar> Scoot-Scootaloo: it loves you too
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Saints Row 3? Not enough replaty value IMO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I lost my case else I would take a pic.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03lol :D
<Kosoveon> thanks
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: AND the Metro license. And, from the info I've seen of the Metro: Last Light, they are tearing at an otherwise amazing franchise

<RainbowBlits> Omlet?! where?!
*otakon hands Midnight_Tempest a muffin......that is also on fire.
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: And they are shoving unwanted multiplayer into a game that didn't need it in order to try to pick up some CoD morons, and doing God knows what else to make the game appeal to the "mainstream" audience. Ugh.
<WallDives> never mind its buggy as hell.
<Dermathil> What game are you talking about SunderlandPony89?
*DaringDude spins in a cirlce then sits down

<SunderlandPony89> Nittany_Discord: At least Valve has survived untouched
<Dermathil> SunderlandPony89: I had heard it had suffered the same fate as Stalker 2.
<WallDives> I remember when EA used shapes as a logo.
*DaringDude never cried really as a child
<Dermathil> So you understand how happy I am.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01E3: Sequels and motion controls.
<Psudopod> Eeew motion control

<RainbowBlits> why wont teh sho load?:S
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: Pretty sure the game is/was gonna come out this holiday season
<otakon> RainbowBlits: no stream atm is all

<HatsuneMikuFan> otakon: I know right
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: don't be depressed!
<WallDives> otakon: tbh, i kinda dont, since my contribution is to their NHL and soon FIFA series.
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: Reminds me of an EA centerd episode of Extra Credits
<Ponies47> Feels like dancing
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: eeyup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Caring about gamers is good when you actually make them.
<Ponies47> Dances
<Om> "EA, its in the game"
<Dermathil> I'm happy about that. I had read stuff that was saying that due to THQ's financial problem they had cancelled Metro Last Light.
<RainbowBlits> oh right *derp*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Instead of doing nothing but selling them.
*Gunthler gives DeathStar a dancing Derpy

<BlueFlare> 02Suddenly I’m feeling restless
<DeathStar> Gunthler: srsly where do you get all these?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: and trying to nickel and dime their customer base for everything they could.
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: I can't imagine why they would considering how well Metro 2033 did
<WallDives> and remember when Square put out good games?
<otakon> EA is Jenny and the Wimp.
<Gunthler> DeathStar: My back pocket :D
<HatsuneMikuFan> The only game I like to play today from EA is SSX and some Battlefield
<otakon> WallDives: yeah, good times man, good times.
<WallDives> instead of cookie-cutter RPGS? Inafune was right.
<Kimori> do you have a bad connection?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03FIFA <3
<SunderlandPony89> WallDives: No. Because JRPGs suck. Trololo...

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01THW is going bankrupt, and they deserve it for using online passes and on-disc DLC.
<teh_Tharassan> fifa?
<WallDives> and this is coming from a Phantasy Star child, I didnt play a FF until I was in Middle School.
<otakon> WallDives: Lost Oddyssey was technically cookie cutter but dammit it was GOOD cookie cutter.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*THQ
<NightSeas> 2Yeah, Spyro is pretty awesome
<Gunthler> DeathStar: Eeyup. :D
<Dermathil> SunderlandPony89: it didn't do as well as other titles. Still, it did better than HOMEFRONT
<otakon> WallDives: but 13, and 13-2 are just......egh.
<Googer12> I don't have a bad Internet connection.
<WallDives> Lost Odyssey was okay.
<RainbowBlits> Any brony here have a youtube account im looking for some brony's i can friend
<WallDives> FF6 and FFT are my favorite FFs.
<Ponies47> RainbowBlits: I do
<teh_Tharassan> X is best ff
<RainbowBlits> Cause none of mah other friends aprove :p
<RainbowBlits> sweet!
<WallDives> when Aeris/th died, people cried, I laughed at them, cause Alis did the same shit years earlier.
<HatsuneMikuFan> RainbowBilts: I have two. One to watch vidoes and one to post
<otakon> teh_Tharassan: it's good, but 6 and 9 are my favorites
<teh_Tharassan> otakon: 9 was kinda boring to me sadly...
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: That's not saying much actually :P. And Metro 2033 deserved to do much better than Homefront. Deserves to do better than... hell, a lot of games actually
<WallDives> still have my SNES copy of 3/6 and instruction manual.
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord: So they deserve to go bankrupt for ONE infraction? You're INSANE. THQ didn't use on-disc DLC for Darksiders, Metro 2033, ANY of the Dawn of War (1 and 2) or Space Marine. So CALM DOWN.
<otakon> teh_Tharassan: eh, I liked it.
<otakon> WallDives: nice
<WallDives> teh_Tharassan: 9's appeal was from its references to prior FFs.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They still use online passes for MP titles.
<Dermathil> um
<WallDives> if you had started at 7 like almost everyone had, you'd have been rightfully lost.
<RainbowBlits> My youtube account is XGruNtpwnEr117X go ahead and friend meh :p
<drfsupercenter> 03ugh, I swear something on my Facebook is broken
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And how do you know they didn't use on-disk DLC for those titles?
<drfsupercenter> 03it keeps showing that I have an unread message even though it doesn't show which one is unread
<BaconMane> 0,5Don't advertise your stuff here please
<drfsupercenter> 03I read all my messages
<Dermathil> last I heard, Space Marine and all of the Dawn of War (1 and 2) DON'T.
<drfsupercenter> 03(both present and past tense)
<Pissed_Tempest> Space Marine is a crap game...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01>Uses online passes, >Deserves to go bankrupt. >No sympathy for online pass-using publishers.
<WallDives> ok, I'm kinda mad now.
<Ingwaz> i need to rant for a quick second.
<SunderlandPony89> Pissed_Tempest: That it was. Forced multiplayer was the main reason for its downfall
<Ponies47> You mad WallDives?
<Dermathil> Nittany: I know, I got preorder on space marine and had to download the necessary files. as an extra update.
<WallDives> Ingwaz: shoot.
<BlueFlare> 02odd
<panda> This convo is interesting :D
*BaconMane puts a muffler onto Ingwaz
<WallDives> Ponies47: not about anything here.
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives I've just finished watching Over The Limit......
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA is circling the drain for similar shit.
<Dark92Enigma> Hi Everypony!
<Dermathil> You know, the update that is pretty DAMN BIG
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back
<panda> Dark92Enigma: herro :D
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: No Ace crusher. I'm VERY pisssed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Plus the nickel and diming they do.
<Pissed_Tempest> also, only listing games from the Warhammer 40k universe doesnt make a publisher good...
<BlueFlare> 02I really wouldn't know what would do that
<Dermathil> and Nittany_Discord, ONE MISTEP IS NOT ENOUGH.
<Ingwaz> i find it baffling that my youngest sister has elected to be a vegetarian. she does not even like most vegetables. she does not eat a proper amount of food each day, or get the proper nutrients. she counts calories to the extreme. AND SHE WANTS TO STUDY DIETARY NUTRITION
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They've used online passes for years.
<SunderlandPony89> MFW EA was awarded worest company in America
<SunderlandPony89> worst*
<Dermathil> GIVE ME PROOF DAMNIT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Since shortly after EA started.
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives IKR? He didn't do anything! He let Big Show do all the work!!!!!!
<drfsupercenter> 03probably getting two messages at once
<WallDives> Ingwaz: has your sister taken steps to prove that this is what she wants to do?
<Ponies47> BUCK! I gotta go! I have to go to bed! But I don't wanna. Anypony wanna sing me a lullaby?
<drfsupercenter> 03or like, while I'm already reading a message
<MahBoi777> Ingwaz: heh siblings lol
<drfsupercenter> 03another comes in
<drfsupercenter> 03and since I see it instantly it's not marked as read
<drfsupercenter> 03or something
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: how about that Savage shout out during Punk/Danielson?
<panda> Ponies47: alright NIGHT NIGHT
<SunderlandPony89> Ingwaz: How old is your sister, man? She sounds quite young
<drfsupercenter> 03but I wish it would tell me what message so I could just hit "mark as read">_>
<Dermathil> A sizeable chunk of my gaming library is filled with THQ titles, NEVER had to use an online pass.
*Gunthler gives Ponies47 a Fluttershy
<Dermathil> NEVER.
*panda sings Ponies47 a lullaby
<PrincessLuna> episode 11 of season 2 finished!
*SunderlandPony89 sings gets Fluttershy to sing Hush Now Quiet Now to Ponies47
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<Ingwaz> WallDives: shes kind of in the wind about it. thats another thing i found absolutely baffling...she lacks the drive or ambition to do anything herself. she wants to be babied pretty much as much as possible
<drfsupercenter> 03dafuq
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives I couldn't help but shout OOOOOOOH YEAH!!! DIG IT?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dermathil: http://derpy.me/XKUCL
<drfsupercenter> 03I click "search for unread messages"
<Ingwaz> SunderlandPony89: i believe shes 19
<drfsupercenter> 03says no results
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: SR3?
<Pissed_Tempest> THQ is a SHIT COMPANY... even if they go bankrupt, Warhammer 40k games will be made... so WHO HONESTLY GIVES A FUCK!
<BlueFlare> 02FailBook
<panda> Ingwaz: you are talking about your sister no?
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord: anything that's not Homefront?
<Ingwaz> MahBoi777: the saddest part is, i'd consider her the smarter of my two younger sisters...the other one...good lord i could go on about her for ages
<WallDives> Ingwaz: then this is possibly a phase, and the best that can be done is to show that this may not be whats best for her. after that, I dont know.
<Ingwaz> panda: yes
<Dermathil> Because you know how much Homefront matters in anything right?
*Gunthler doesn't care about the arguing
<WallDives> Thats what I've done with my sisters, though, and most of the time, it works.
<SunderlandPony89> Ingwaz: Then she comes off as pretty immature
*DeathStar hugs Pissed_Tempest calm down silly filly
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives btw in less than 2 hours, (sigh) it'll be one year since Macho Man passed away (looks at the time) 1 hour left.....
<Gunthler> DeathStar: O_O
<MahBoi777> Ingwaz: that bad?
<panda> Ingwaz: well... ive learned thats what sisters do. she doesnt use the "im a female so I can get what I want" thing does she? cuz thats what my sister does
<Vordox> Since someone spoke about Blazblue before, forgot who... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DzSL7mbcoI&feature=BFa&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ !
<Dermathil> Pissed_Tempest: the problem is, WHO would publish them after that? I've heard talks that if THQ falls, They go straight in EA's ARMS.
<mario_pony> Pissed_Tempest: why u pissed? :(
<Ponies47> Is sung to bye Sunderlandpony89, panda, and Fluttershy.
<Ingwaz> WallDives: another thing that baffles me about her, i've tried that. i've told her its not healthy, she does not listen. she literally just shuts it out, ignores it and acts like she knows whats best even though she has no research to back it up
<Dermathil> Would you prefer seeing EA getting their hands on Warhammer40K?
<Ponies47> OK BYE!
<Dermathil> I don't.
<WallDives> Ingwaz: then she has to shoot her own foot.
<Dermathil> I definitively DONT
<MahBoi777> bye Ponies47!
<BlueFlare> 02try refreshing cookies?
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: That's a scary thought acctually. New metro titles in the hands of EA would most certanily be destroyed
<Ponies47> Falls asleep
<mario_pony> bye Ponies47
<panda> Vordox: hehe i know pretty much all of those :D

<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02i liek poniez ^-^
<Om> WallDives: I've done that with a paint ball guna few times
<Ingwaz> WallDives: we were hoping she would do that when she moved five hours away to go to a distant university...she came back just as bad as before
<drfsupercenter> 03uh, why would it have to do with cookies?
<MahBoi777> ohai SB
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: honestly? This week is far worse than that for me. Savages death is tragic, but...

<drfsupercenter> 03I could log in on another browser and it would still do it
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Ohai :3
<Dermathil> SunderlandPony89: That's why we need THQ. They are one of the better alternatives.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ohai SB64
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives: And Christian became IC CHAMP! (With no buildup towards his new face persona)
<Vordox> panda: Then face me.. I find almost NO people here in Sweden who can beat me in Blazblue. :( Hate winning easy tournaments
*DeathStar dances on SuperBrony64|AFK s head "that dosent look afk"
<dalekkahn> Could anybody tell me when Avatar, legend of Korra is streamed normally ?
<WallDives> Ingwaz: then I have nothing else, I dont know.
<Ingwaz> panda: she does get away with that, my father is soft
<Pissed_Tempest> Dermathil: anyone would be willing to pick up the license... THQ doesnt even make the games, Relic does... a Canadian company... so you trying to defend a publisher that makes money by putting their name on the box is just dumb...
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: ikr?
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives that's why i sighed
<panda> :( I dont have it on my ps3
<Gunthler> SuperBrony64: I thought of you mooing when I saw some cows today :D
<BlueFlare> 02dunno. Cookies can do weird stuff like that
<Ingwaz> WallDives: normally i don't want to punch people...but extreme ignorance just angers me...
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: The less of two evils I guess :\
<panda> Ingwaz: oh wow... i bet he is hard on you though huh?
<teh_Tharassan> Hmm bronycon, whos going?

<Dermathil> Pissed_Tempest: I know Relic does the fking games. What I say is that EA IS WORSE THAN THQ.
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives I cried when i found out he passed away...we all did......
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll try in IE,w here I don't keep cookies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Keep going Dermathil?
<panda> Vordox: not sure if you seen it but I dont have it on my ps3 :( i always play at a friends house
<WallDives> Ingwaz: it does to, and its why I'm out of contact with most of my family.
<Ingwaz> panda: eh, hes not a complete hardflank, but he does expect more from me than he does of her. thats just the way he was raised
<MahBoi777> dalekkahn: saturday I think, but I dunno the time
<Vordox> panda: Oh XD
<SunderlandPony89> teh_Tharassan: If I had the large amount of money it would require to go, I would. But alas, I'm poor
*Gunthler pokes SuperBrony64
<Dermathil> Also Nittany, I'm surprised. It seems EVERY SINGLE GAME that I have from THQ doesn't have any of those things they are accused of.
<Pissed_Tempest> Dermathil: EA set the standard for being crap... everyone else is trying to reach that level... deal with it
<Dermathil> Meaning They mustn't have pushing them.
<panda> Ingwaz: hm... protect the girls and man-up the boys?
<dalekkahn> Thanks MahBoi777 :D. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for it
<drfsupercenter> 03interesting

<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<BlueFlare> 02yep
<MahBoi777> no prob:)
<BlueFlare> 02thought it was cookies
<Spell-of-Gaming> If I'm not mistaken
<drfsupercenter> 03well I can delete any cookies involving facebook
<Ingwaz> panda: pretty much. when i was a young teen, i mowed the lawn in the very hot summer heat for years, neither of my two sisters ever did it for a full summer
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't want to clear all of mine as LOL having to login to sites
<panda> Vordox: sowwy :(
<Ingwaz> panda: he always ended up doing it for them half the time
<Dermathil> Pissed_Tempest: Incorrect. Not everybody is. They need to lower their standards to make their ends meet because EA is money grabbing so much. Otherwise you wouldn't even have GoG.
<Spell-of-Gaming> THQ published a G3 My Little Pony game. Am I right?
<Vordox> panda: No worries. =3 Only found 3 people who can beat me, barely here in Sweden. Perhaps go to Jap and try rookie. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Until THQ stops using online passes (and on-disc DLC), I will wish them a swift death because trash publishers like them need to go.
<SunderlandPony89> Ingwaz: I know that feeling. My sister doesn't do ANY chores; I gotta do them all. At least I get paid for mowing the lawn :D
<panda> Ingwaz: sorry, but I hate fathers like that... they just give into the stereo types
<drfsupercenter> 03fixed
*Gunthler pokes DeathStar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Major publishers period need to go. They ruined gaming.
<BlueFlare> 02nice
<Dermathil> Besides, THQ didn't push online passes on the Warhammer title games. So either they are VERY specific on what titles they want them on (SURPRISINGLY) Or the developpers are pushing for them too.
*DeathStar dances on Gunthler s finger
<Ingwaz> SunderlandPony89: well, shes been cleaning on her own a bit, so i don't begrudge her the chore part. i was just showing what it was like growing up
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives I remember he was also in a Dexter's ''Dial M for Monkey'' episode.....RASSLOR. that one when he voiced an intergalactic wrestler bent to take on all comers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Except for Space Marines, modern Warhammer titles have been PC exclusive.
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: I vaguely remember that.
<Ingwaz> MahBoi777: btw, late response, yes the other sister is that bad, completely mind boggling bad
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't need an online pass for PC games.
<SunderlandPony89> Ingwaz: Ha. I wish my sister cleaned up after herself. The amount of times I've had to clean her messes are to damn high. She's 19 years old too
<Dermathil> Space Marines didn't need an online pass.
<mario_pony> hey you!!
<DerpStar> Hey everypony!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No used games marked to milk.
<DeathStar> hi DerpStar!
<SunderlandPony89> 'Ello DerpStar
<WallDives> hi DerpStar.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi DerpStar
<Dermathil> Oh, so because you play games on console, EVERYONE should suffer?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ohai DerpStar
<Om> I have a good sister...
<Pissed_Tempest> you know what... im not arguing this shit anymore... im fucking tired of it, THQ is shit... EA is shit, Ubisoft is shit... they are all SHIT... a few good games per company, doesnt make them a good company... im fucking done...
<Dermathil> How considerate of you Nittany.
<mario_pony> Hey You!
<Gunthler> GilDash:
<MahBoi777> Ingwaz: lol, dats okay, I got a younger brother and sister, the sister is trying to lose weight, and the brother is just flat-out evil.
<panda> Vordox: oh, did you ever play guilty gear?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dermathil: I guess you love bad business. EA-like publishers like that. People that will defend bad business practices.
<Dermathil> I don't mind if Console games need online passes. That's what happens when you use hardware that's preventing the industry to use the cutting-edge technology to its fullest potential.
<Vordox> panda: Used to do, JAM FTW
<DerpStar> Oh most brothers are evil MahBoi777
<MahBoi777> hey DerpStar!
<panda> Vordox: jam was my main and Zappa was back up ^^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And people like that are why major game publishers abuse the hell out of consumers.
<mario_pony> MahBoi777: she hot?
<BlueFlare> 02also
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because everyone takes it and defends the practices.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So people will half a brain suffer.
<Vordox> panda: Bah zappa, everyone knows that Jam was the one and only. ;D
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord, EA and Activision can go to hell. Ubisoft is borderline. THQ is trying to do good.
<Ingwaz> MahBoi777: losing weight is the youngest sisters reason for watching her calories so much. she fails to understand that because she watches them to such an extreme, shes basically starving herself and her body will hold on to everything she gives it. she wont even eat vegetarian corn dogs because they have 150 per dog rather than 120-140 calories per vegetarian chicken patty
<DerpStar> Is my net slow or is there no stream ATM?
<BlueFlare> 02you should totaly submit that to failblog
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: Lolwut:D
*BlueFlare runs
<WallDives> DerpStar: no stream.
<mario_pony> ikd :P
<Dermathil> Besides, I love how you lump every publisher in the same bag.
<mario_pony> oops
<BlueFlare> 02totally*
<mario_pony> *idk
<DeathStar> Dermathil: no stream
<Ingwaz> MahBoi777: i also understand the brother part...my older brother was a jerk when we were kids...
<DerpStar> :(
<panda> Vordox: yeah, but it was hard getting off her super specials mid fight, especially if someone was one you, but zappa could pull of his spirit release thing when ever :D
<Ingwaz> fortunately he did grow out of it a bit, hopefully yours will too
<Kandarihu> The problem is, do you choose to buy a game that you really want to, if the terms of the publishing is abusive?
<Dermathil> Next you'll say Valve needs to go bankrupt because Steam is also partly-DRM.
<drfsupercenter> 03nah
<Vordox> panda: Well Jam wa sa hit and runner. ;)

<WallDives> GilDash: hi, bye, and sorry.
<GilDash> WallDives: Sorry for what? :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Online passes are for milking. Nothing else. It's punishing people for buying used because they don't have the money to buy new like publishers want.
<panda> Vordox: hehe :) I used to use Sol as well ^^
<panda> GilDash: aww byes :(
<WallDives> GilDash: if you dont remember, thats for the better. night.
<Vordox> panda: Sol was an arse. ._.
<GilDash> WallDives: Why, did you do something to Om? :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not to pay servers or to not steal from poor devs.
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord: you do know that used sales are also VERY bad for the developper, right?
<WallDives> No.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Too bad.
<GilDash> WallDives: Well, whatever.
<Dermathil> Because they recieve exactly 0% of the cut?
<drfsupercenter> 03God dang it Sonic 4.2
<GilDash> Night guys. :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Publishers: "Used = Piracy"
<drfsupercenter> 03stop sucking so much

<drfsupercenter> 03these bonus staegs
<panda> Vordox: haha i know which is why I used him in tournments, I knew his astral heat death touch :D
<drfsupercenter> 03*stages
<drfsupercenter> 03are obnoxious as frick'
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Doesn't make cutting parting of the game out right.
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: Woah woah woah, you're gonna defend publishers when it comes to used games?
<SunderlandPony89> Night GilDash
<BlueFlare> 02that they are
<WallDives> Om: considering him/her, its actually a logical jump.
<Om> Night none-the-less GilDash
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If they want more new game sales, stop making the new product undesireable.
*panda glomps GilDash ill see you tomorrow? ;)
<GilDash> panda: Yeah, you will. ;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like, no DRM or microtransactions.
<Om> WallDives: Still...I don't like it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or always-on DRM.
<panda> woot!
<Dermathil> SunderlandPony89: in certain cases, yes. When it is because the Developper needs the money that comes from their cut from new sales, yes.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or something buggy.
<GilDash> Now, really. Night! :D
<Ingwaz> well, i do feel a bit better after ranting a bit. so thanks to those who listened
<panda> :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Make the game cheaper or worth the $60

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And make the paid copy worse than the pirated version.
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord, you are going way too hardcore. That's like saying "WE NEED TO KILL ALL HUMANS BECAUSE WE ARE POLLUTING THE PLANET." Things can CHANGE, no need to murder everyone involved.
<Om> WallDives: Right. I'll keep that in mind.
<Kandarihu> You know what those publishers should do? Just make their games use decentralized online multiplayer and distribute patches over bit torrent. Bandwidth problems solved.
<Ingwaz> huh? worse than the pirated version?
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives: if you can't Skip it....then you´ll have to wait until the end of the dodgeball episode.
<panda> Nittany_Discord: well... the gaming industry is shit :( which is why I pirate then buy XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*better
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: In that case I'll agree. For games like Lolipop Chainsaw that really need the sales, I'll defend the need for new copies of games like that to be sold. Should of pointed that out when you first brought up used game sales though
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, do I want to leave trollish comments for people who use instagram?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Legit copies are already worse then pirated copies mostly.
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: I know what cartoon it is, I cant see it right now though, I have other things running.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because of on-disc DLC and/or online passes.
<Aurora> 6like everyone else who comments about instagram
<Aurora> 6cuz you wont be the first

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dermathil: as far as gaming publishers and that industry goes, it's only going to get worse with the current people involved.
<mario_pony> hi Dan
<Spell-of-Gaming> :)
<panda> WallDives: its out already????
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord, the DEV TEAM is partially responsible for the content. The Publisher gives the funding and in exchange gets a part of the sales and limited oversight of the project to make sure their money is invested well. When a game is shit, the developpers are partly to blame. The Publishers are not the only ones at fault.
<Dan> :) <3 thank you everypony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because most are short-sighted and greedy.
<WallDives> panda: in Japan. American version is this fall.
<SunderlandPony89> Dan: A new brony? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsddzah7p9w&list=FLMiKyfpd2YMs-0bb-hnzcFA&index=5&feature=plpp_video Welcome to the herd!

<panda> WallDives: id there a patched english version
<Dan> yes I am a new brony
<Dermathil> Question: Nittany, do you believe Bethesda should also go bankrupt because of their business practices?
*DeathStar dances the welcome dance on Dan s head "WELCOME BRONY!"
<Ingwaz> Dan: welcome to the herd
<WallDives> panda: not yet, but there will be a legit one soon, and i'm sure there will be a english playthrough of it soon, if it isnt out already.
<SunderlandPony89> mario_pony: That was mean :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bethseda doesn't have bad business practices.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No online passes.
<MahBoi777> SunderlandPony89: That's mah horse!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No on-disc DLC.
<panda> WallDives: i will check around and see if anyone patched it already, should I link you?
<RainbowBlits> http://www.youtube.com/user/XGruNtpwnEr117X?feature=mhee
<Dan> thank you kindly, I hope you all treat me well
*MahBoi777 hits SunderlandPony89 with a chair
*SunderlandPony89 slaps MahBoi777 "That's MY horse!"
<Dermathil> Brink and Rage?
<Ingwaz> Dan: as a new brony I believe you will find that we are generally very welcoming here. so if you see a conversation that interests you at all, please jump in, we wont think anything bad about it
<mario_pony> MahBoi777: lolwut
<WallDives> panda: not really, I'm willing to wait.
<Ingwaz> MahBoi777: NO THATS MY HORSE!
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Dermathil> Are you saying there was nothing bad involved with Brink and RAGE?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rage is id.
<panda> WallDives: aww okies :D
*Ingwaz whacks MahBoi777
<drfsupercenter> 03Pokémon 2000 gets blocked worldwide by ShoPro, but the first movie doesn't
<Dermathil> ID is the developper.
<drfsupercenter> 03I think the third will be fine too given that my AMV didn't get blocked
<Dan> okay, Ingwaz ^^
<Dermathil> Wikipedia lists Bethesda as the publisher for RAGE.
<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: Brink just sucked though, and Rage was OK
<MahBoi777> Ingwaz: NO WAIT, IT'S MAH HORSE!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think iD put the online pass in.
*drfsupercenter made a YT channel from the German server and is going to upload as many full Pokémon movies in HD as possible
<Dan> these live streams are every week?
*MahBoi777 smacks Ingwaz
<WallDives> Dan: there's streams most of the day, just not now.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Brink didn't have an online pass that I'm aware of.
<Dermathil> OH, SO NOW THE DEVELOPPER IS TO BLAME WHEN IT COMES TO BETHESDA.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Dan: These livestreams are everyday!
<Ingwaz> MahBoi777: no, its my horse!
*Ingwaz punches MahBoi777
<Spell-of-Gaming> t
<MahBoi777> :D
<Dan> oh ok cool :D
<Pissed_Tempest> honestly... still talking about this shit? really?
*SunderlandPony89 wacks Ingwaz's with the SS otakon
<DeathStar> Dan: everyday meaning whenever a mod feels like streaming
<Dan> what time are they usually on?
<Dermathil> You are saying it yourself. There are times when the Developper is the one who puts the DRM and stuff like that on. Isn't always the Publisher.
<Dan> oh so there's no particular schedule
<Dermathil> EVERYONE IS TO BLAME.
<twilight_sprinkler> ^
<Ingwaz> Dan: generally there is somebody streaming something. its pretty rare that we actually stream ponies, thats usually saved for the weekends
<WallDives> Dan: not really.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Dan: 24 hours a day!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You have a point.
*twilight_sprinkler blames everyone
<DeathStar> Dan: exept on brony movie nights every friday
<Pissed_Tempest> congrat Dermathil... everyone is to blame, can we finally drop this shit? please?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And as much as I would love to engage in this SRS, I must go eat bread
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I know as far as THQ is concerned, they are the behind their online passes.
<alfye> just got here from sweeties mansion its a pretty good fic:)
<MahBoi777> it's all mah fault?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I mean go to bed~
<WallDives> Scoot-Scootaloo: just bread?
<Dermathil> But the Developpers are not rich enough to fund the game development cycle without help.
<twilight_sprinkler> Scoot-Scootaloo: woooo, bread, the food of gods!..and college students
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Scoot-Scootaloo
<WallDives> oh. night then, Scoot-Scootaloo.

<Dan> I love you guys already
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because gamers and devs are getting tired of publishers.
<RainbowBlits> WHOO!
<Dermathil> THQ's business practices may not be picture-perfect, but it doesn't change the fact that they are still doing better stuff than EA and Activision.
<Ingwaz> lol, if you're a brony, you'll probably fit right in Dan
*SunderlandPony89 thinks Freedom Fighters 2 is in desperate need of a kickstarter
<RainbowBlits> Any one else wathing epic pie time at this moment?
<MahBoi777> Dan: you'll love eet here lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry, but I'll never defend a publisher that uses online passes.

<TheRainbowDash> Rainbow: Yeah, I am working on my story now, only a few more minutes until I am finished!:)
<DeathStar> Pissed_Tempest: no need for that just burst into flames
<Dermathil> Ingwaz: that's because they got a few millions from it and are making a new point-and-click adventure.
<SunderlandPony89> Nittany_Discord: 100% of the original ones?
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: we talk about this too much, can we not do this again please?
<Rainbow> TheRainbowDash: You're making a story?!
<MahBoi777> Ingwaz: Wait no! it's your horse it's your horse! lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision won't give serious funding or attention to any game that doesn't have "Call of Duty" in the title.
<Ingwaz> Dermathil: wait wait wait, welovefine, the clothes selling website right?
<Pissed_Tempest> i dont want to burst into flames... i just want this shit to stop...
<Rainbow> Nittany_Discord: LOL
<Ingwaz> MahBoi777: ah ah ah MahBoi777, thats not how it goes

<emangamer> Pissed_Tempest: calm down deep breaths

<BlueFlare> 02[21:09] <%drfsupercenter> Pokémon 2000 gets blocked worldwide by ShoPro, but the first movie doesn't <-- they think there's too many Lugia fans already
<Spell-of-Gaming> :P
<Dermathil> Prototype 2 was seen as a major release. Activision pushed it a HELL of a lot.
*BlueFlare flees
<MahBoi777> we're arguing?
<twilight_sprinkler> World of warcraft: call of paladin duty
<DeathStar> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: nothing just dance~
<MahBoi777> lol
<Ingwaz> Dermathil: oh how i wish i could throw money at games like fighting is magic and legends of equestria
<Dermathil> Also, Diablo 3.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have them, but you don't have the numbers for failed kickstarters.
<Ingwaz> Dan: are you aware of the main pony related sites that most bronies use?
<twilight_sprinkler> call of diablo 3 duty
<Dermathil> Nittany, I was asking you to find them.
<RainbowBlits> winter wrap up winter wrap up!
<Dan> no I'm not Ingwaz
<Dermathil> Besides, Activision funded Diablo 3, didn't they?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't easily fetch the number of games turned down by publishers.
<Dermathil> (It isn't a CoD)
<RainbowBlits> dont judge me
<Ingwaz> Dan: i'll pm you then and inform you

<SunderlandPony89> Dermathil: It's nearly as large as a CoD game though
<MahBoi777> WOO Songz
<twilight_sprinkler> i wish they would remake evil genius, i loved that game
<drfsupercenter> 03(Japanese name for VIZ, who owns the copyrights to Pokémon)
<Dermathil> SunderlandPony89: doesn't matter. Nittany said ONLY Cod gets funding.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i sense alot of h8 in this arugement
<drfsupercenter> 03I might disupte the claim for lulz, since they really can't do anything to me
<DeathStar> Dan: try equestria daily it has all the pony news

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision didn't lend a cent to Blizzard for Diablo 3.
<DeathStar> alfye: yes
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol DeathStar yes Dyslexic <_< >_>
<Dermathil> They spent it nonetheless
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> SunderlandPony89: im already on the darkside

<MahBoi777> SunderlandPony89: Lol, how strange
<Dermathil> They were already leaching off of CoD while they were leaching off of Guitar Hero. They showed they can leach off of two games at once.

<WallDives> emangamer: probably not.
<Dermathil> They aren't doing that with CoD because they saw that doing it too much causes it to die
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I want to end it.

<MahBoi777> tis good
<Vordox> otakon: He can't...XD
<Maid_Luna_of_War> I wish I had that superpower
<SunderlandPony89> Vordox: YES! YES! YES!
<Maid_Luna_of_War> Powers of Chaos :)
<SunderlandPony89> Vordox: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VheAwZBuQ&list=PL61FB9F68B20BB8D4&index=12&feature=plpp_video
<Dken2021> how does his neighbors put up with him during recrding?
<Kimori> I picked up this view master handheld game
<MahBoi777> Yaplap has a voicebox of steel
<Dan> fire is my favorite bending
<Vordox> MahBoi777: Not for long XD
<Ponies47> BUCK YEAH YAPLAP! :[
<Sally> what's that?
<DeathStar_> sitting is my favorite type of bending
<Suinide> Ohs
<Kimori> Do you remember those things that had this wheel where it had small pictures on it
<Maid_Luna_of_War> Dan - I like how Iroh was all "Lightning is serious business. Only great masters can use it." and now friggen EVERYPONY can lightning bend
<MahBoi777> Vordox: lol, it will be so sad once he loses his voice
<Dan> ikr Maid_Luna_of_War
<Kimori> and you would stick it into this thing that you would look in to view it?
<Dan> same with metal bending!
<Kimori> its called a view master
<MahBoi777> infinite Energy
<Ponies47> http://www.redbubble.com/people/lcpsycho/works/7806620-this-aint-a-shirt Then what is it?
<Suinide> Mhm
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvNLjOuYSFQ&feature=channel&list=UL <-- The classic one that STARTED IT ALL XD
<Maid_Luna_of_War> Well, Lynn is Toph's daughter
<Kimori> well the difference with this thing I found is that it has an lcd screen inside it
<Dan> there are other metal benders though
<Sally> ooooh
<MahBoi777> Amon is just an evil badass
<SunderlandPony89> Welp, that gave me a headache. AND I HAVE NO REGRETS
<Vordox> SunderlandPony89: XD Check the one I just posted.
<Suinide> Lol
<Sally> :p
<Cooldude> It's half past twelve in the afternoon here.
<Kimori> http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Tandy/3D.htm
<Maid_Luna_of_War> Even if Lynn Beifong is an older lady, she is oddly hot...
<Kimori> thats what it looks like
<Ponies47> BUCK YEAH I WUB YAPLAP! :[
<Dken2021> not going there. . .
<Vordox> "AT THE GALA AT THE GAAAALAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIH!"
<SunderlandPony89> Vordox: I didn't even know he did the opening! :D
<drfsupercenter> 03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/funny-graphs-the-only-reasonable-explanation.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03:D
<Dan> actually, I don't think that's lightning bending, but just being able to course lightning through their bodies. That's why Iroh couldn't teach Zuko how to make lightning, but he knew that firebenders can always just learn how to manipulate lightning thrown at them
<Sally> didnt tandy make the armatron?
<Ponies47> YAPLAP BETTER DO THE FU*KING DAY ARIA! :[
<Dan> maybe that explains it
<Vordox> The gala song he did is...OH MY fricking god. XD
<Dken2021> Ponies47 he has
<Ponies47> *THIS
<DeathStar_> Ponies47: he did
<Kimori> umm I dont know
<Maid_Luna_of_War> Dan Mako and the others at the power factory where bending it
<Ponies47> WHAT!
<Viri> 14lol
<Viri> 14I disagree
*Viri runs
<Viri> 14ALSO
<SunderlandPony89> Righto, I gotta get some sleep
<Dan> yeah but were they creating their own lightning or just manipulating it?
<Viri> 14!weather cologno monzese italy

<Vordox> Ponies47: Want a better ideea..Activate the SOUND Caption XD

<Shamroc> FlareChaser: doing fine
<Kimori> woah
<Maid_Luna_of_War> Wire works just as well as a body
<VenHur96> -sigh- It's kind of sad no one's steaming.

<Biglaw> Alrighty FlareChaser
<Sally> :O they sell for 50+
<Biglaw> Hello pony_7774!
<Kimori> It was missing everything from what I remember
<MahBoi777> hello pony_7774
<Sally> the toys and such?
<Kimori> it was just the base and the crane
<Dan> I wonder if it would be illegal to lightning bend in that one bending sport
<Biglaw> http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg
<jesus> hello
<Sally> interesting
<Maid_Luna_of_War> Pro bending
<Kimori> the batteries were left in it
<Kimori> it had a ton of leakage
<MahBoi777> hi jesus
<pony_7774> lol at that picture. xD
<Sally> hmm
<DeathStar_> hi jesus
<jesus> how you guys doing?
<DeathStar_> good
<MahBoi777> Sumerpan is greatest hero
<Kimori> thats interesting though
<Sally> well next time you see a cheap one you can prob make a profit off of it
<Kimori> didnt think it really had any value
<Sally> yeppers
<Biglaw> I like Iron Pan
<jesus> i just made a rainbow dash plushie
<MahBoi777> doing great jesus, and u?
<Litwick> Wow. All the mods are asleep.
<Kimori> I don't really do the buying and selling stuff though
<Sally> i've seen some go for 80
<Shizuka> 13am not
<Biglaw> Or Smider Pan
<Kimori> I use to a while back
<TheRainbowDash> Yay! My story is now visible on the site!
<Kimori> but nowadays I just buy to keep
<Dan> oh it's called pro bending? I gotta pay attention lol
<Biglaw> TheRainbowDash congratulations!
<TheRainbowDash> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/25881/Fluttershy-Starring-In%3A-Shy-of-My-Own-Kind
<Sally> yeah, i was getting it for my bf.
<Litwick> You're obviously sleep-typing Shizu.
<TheRainbowDash> There it is, if you are interested to rea it.
<Vordox> Hai Shizuka .
<TheRainbowDash> (read)
<Kimori> you were? why?
<jesus> nice
<Shamroc> Shizuka.....you never did answer the question i asked you in game...
<Shizuka> 13which
<Maid_Luna_of_War> Dan: My theory is that Aang's non-bending middle son is Amon
<junh1024-XD> Viri, by definition, if humidity goes over 100%, it has to rain.
*Biglaw eats a pound of sugar
<Sally> he had one as a kid & wanted to get one and display it
<Kimori> ohh
<Viri> 14o.o
<Shamroc> Shizuka: the one if you think im an annoying asshole or a fun guy..
<Viri> 14really?
<pony_7774> pinkie pie eats twenty pounds of sugar a minute
<Shizuka> 13oh, you are a good person~
<Kimori> that sounds like what I probably wouldive done
<Shamroc> WOO!
<Biglaw> ?
<Dan> Maid_Luna_of_War: wow that's a pretty bold claim. Hm, but it actually makes sense
<Sally> yep. wish it wldve worked out.
<Viri> 14I remember reaching the 90% sometimes, with a sun that was as hot as the hell xD
<Kimori> well if I ever find one ill let you know
<Sally> he later told me that he cld have easily replace the wire...*after* i sent it back of course
<junh1024-XD> well, that's what you perceive

<Biglaw> Bai
<Dken2021> have fun FlareChaser
<FlareChaser> I'll still be in the chat, ping me if you need me.
<junh1024-XD> you feel hot because your sweat can't evaporate that well
<Maid_Luna_of_War> 1. Katara and their daughter are both waterbenders, so they have that connection. 2. Aang would have had to spend a LOT of time with Tenzin
<Kimori> I always seem to find the unusual stuff
<Dken2021> hey FlareChaser
<VenHur96> I usually think fanfics, to me, are kind of boring to read through..
<Sally> What kind of store was it that you went to?
<DeathStar_> FlareChaser: I need you to dance with me!
<Kimori> some 2nd hand store
<Kimori> its like goodwill
<pony_7774> I personally like the readings better then reading for fanfics
<MahBoi777> FlareChaser
<pony_7774> uh..I think it was Mic the Microphone zero's reading of My little Dashie that made me cry xD
<Kimori> they use to have better stuff before but now its rare to find something actually good there

<TheHoodyNinja> panda: We had ladybugs in my kindergarten class as pets, and i was the only one who was like "What the ever-loving fuck?"
<TheHoodyNinja> Ponies47: Changeling!
<superretroworld> TheHoodyNinja: well that explains everything

<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh, wait, I mean parents
<twilight_sprinkler> how is it offensive
<panda> me as well TheHoodyNinja, but... i was understanding enough to know that everyone has their own likes
<Dken2021> it's offensive to my brain
<crazypony> so much squinking
<TheHoodyNinja> Dken2021: No, we had ladybugs tho, and I thought it was completely pointless
<Spell-of-Gaming> Squink usually means the crossing of eyes, I think.
*TheHoodyNinja squinks until his arms explode

<TrixieMuffin> isnt that squint ?

<Ninjazz|Depressed> Can't handle that amount in this mood.
<Polydunami> Goodnight otakon ;)

<twilight_sprinkler> gudbai Shizuschlafen
<BaseballJenkins> Night Shizuschlafen! Sleep well!
<Sebiale> ugh
<TheHoodyNinja> Ive seen bigger
<TheHoodyNinja> YOU FAIL
<Sebiale> What's up with the ladybigs?
<Midnight_Tempest> honestly... whenever Val streams, i dont say shit about anything... its just easier than way...
<Dken2021> so is this the climax?
<TheHoodyNinja> Stop singing and work on the party
<Midnight_Tempest> also, if you dont like something... dont say you dont like it, just dont watch the damn thing...
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I've learned it's just best to just go do something else for a while...
<BaseballJenkins> Spike is awesome in this. :3
<Sebiale> Spyro? Is that you? Is this what he does between games?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Until Val plays that awesome robot game.
<Polydunami> It's Spike
<Polydunami> Seriously
<BananaJenkins> Lol.
<BananaJenkins> ikr
<Dken2021> well act I was useless
<TheHoodyNinja> Ninjazz|Depressed: Is Ereuka 7 in that game?
*TheHoodyNinja puts hand down
<Kandarihu> G3 Spike really reminds me of one of the Koopa Kids.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Actually, I believe so, TheHoodyNinja.
<BananaJenkins> *Crickets*
<Sebiale> A millenia old baby dragon?
<Sebiale> lol?
<TheHoodyNinja> G3 spike is a fatass
<Kandarihu> MILLENIUM DRAGON
<BazookaJenkins> Lol.
<crazypony> G3 Spike reminds me of Barney
<BazookaJenkins> PINKIE RAISE
<TheHoodyNinja> crazypony: but is g4 spike that looks like him...
<Dken2021> they're being fancy?
<TheHoodyNinja> OF COURSE Lyra comes in on the finger discussion
<Sebiale> How do ponys do the "pinky-finger sip"?
<Sebiale> ponies*
<BazookaJenkins> idk...
<Polydunami> Rule Britannia in a kids show?
<Polydunami> Wow
<crazypony> history lesson!
<FlareChaser> oh god mods.
<TheHoodyNinja> A song about proper tea ettiquit...
<FlareChaser> WHY
*TheHoodyNinja ragequit
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hey, Flare.
<Dken2021> allo FlareChaser
<BoffinJenkins> The ladybugs will eat my liver...
<TheHoodyNinja> 28% remaining
<Sebiale> I give him proprs for the singing voice.
<FlareChaser> I have a feeling the mods actually like this.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Just Val, I hope.
<Sebiale> Sassy aren't they . . .
<TheHoodyNinja> LYRA!
<Dken2021> I bet there's another one of these hidden around the net somewhere
<Kandarihu> In my grand fanfic concept, G3 is the distant future of G4. So how about G3 Spike and G4 Spike being one and the same... and serving as a historian of the great pony war that happened when he was young.
<crazypony> those ladybugs are overly girly
<Sebiale> Alice's tea part involved psychotic individuals . . . intentional reference. :P
<TheHoodyNinja> I used to rip the wings off of ladybugs when i was 4
<TheHoodyNinja> now i know why
<Ninjazz|Depressed> lol
<Ninjazz|Depressed> You crazy, man.
<BrownieJenkins> Lol, ikr
<Polydunami> Last time I was here, I was given a lecture on the mutation of the definition of brony by Ghosties
<Sebiale> Sew and Sew?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Oh, you were here for that, Polydunami?
<Wrek> 05hey folks
<Ninjazz|Depressed> How he went on about... Sethisto?
<Sebiale> RD and Scootaloo?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hey, Wrek!
<BookJenkins> Ohai Wrek
<Wrek> 05gona get me some coffy and another hours of rest
<Dken2021> lali-ho Wrek
<TheHoodyNinja> hi Wrek welcome to hell
<Wrek> 05and shit
<Polydunami> I was the one who prompted the lecture in the first place, Ninjazz
<panda> Wrek: kk :D
<Wrek> 05then maybe work some more on spitfire
<Polydunami> Also, hey there Wrek :3
<panda> Ninjazz|Depressed: well... hopefully you feel better
*RainBroDash 10licks Wrek
<Bronyjenkins> :3
<Sebiale> Those ladybugs are stage hogs.
<Wrek> 05TheHoodyNinja I was already there
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Ahhh, I don't think I recall all the details, Polydunami.
*TheHoodyNinja pulls RainBroDash off of Wrek
<Kandarihu> I wasn't here for that. How was the attitude surrounding previous generations?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> panda: I will. Just this day needs to end on a better note. Thanks for caring, man. :)
<Dken2021> ok, screw it, I'm heading to bed there's so much G3 I can only take
<BronyJenkins> The legs....
<panda> Ninjazz|Depressed: so problem, anything for a pal /)
<TheHoodyNinja> panda: what happen?

<Ninjazz|Depressed> Gnight Dken2021. Take care!
<panda> Dken2021: night night
<Ninjazz|Depressed> panda: Screw that man. *hugs*
<BronyJenkins> :3
<Polydunami> Basically, the mods are getting fed up by the idea that fans are trying to become better than each other
*panda hugs Ninjazz|Depressed "hehe"
*BlueFlare pets drf
<Polydunami> Rather than simply trying to enjoy the show
<Dken2021> night all of you, enjoy the G3
<Spell-of-Gaming> The G3 socks are scarfs
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Yeah, I remember that talk, Polydunami.
<BronyJenkins> Fans are doing that?
<TheHoodyNinja> Polydunami: every fan better than me lol
<Polydunami> Don't think like that. Seriously
<Vinyl> Hello
<panda> BronyJenkins: yeah... some of them. not us though
<Polydunami> Hey Vinyl :)
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hey, Vinyl!
<TheHoodyNinja> I aint done shit for community
<TheHoodyNinja> hi Vinyl
<BronyJenkins> Thank god we aren't. xD
<Ninjazz|Depressed> You don't need to, man. Just being you on this chat is one thing.

<BronyJenkins> Swag spike is best spike.
<Polydunami> Speaking of disco, we lost Robin Gibb today
<Vinyl> Test
<TheHoodyNinja> This is actually entertaining
<Polydunami> Wait, is that disco?

<BronyJenkins> I'm hiring Swag Spike for a night club.
<panda> dat sir mix a lot
<Ninjazz|Depressed> TheHoodyNinja: Why can't you use your ninja powers, man? :D
<crazypony> G3 spike is now the new Vinyl Sratch
<Polydunami> We actually lost Donna Summer a few days ago too... so disco has taken a big hit
*BronyJenkins is turning into Swag Spike
<panda> shake your cutie... hm....
<TheHoodyNinja> Ninjazz|Depressed: Who do you think taught me my skills, runs in the family
<Ninjazz|Depressed> So apparently Guile's theme does go well with this. :D
<Swag_Spike> :3
<Ninjazz|Depressed> TheHoodyNinja: Good point...
<Kandarihu> If your laptop is configured any way like mine, it won't run all the way down to 0% before automatically shutting down.
*panda glomps Swag_Spike XD
*Swag_Spike glomps panda back. :3

<Golakka> Sleep with one eye open Kriel_Pony
<Polydunami> If one of those things were there when I woke up... I'd think someone was wearing a costume and trying to murder me :O
<Swag_Spike> Well, I liked Swag SPike and his rap, and the rest is actually standable.
<panda> Swag_Spike: well... to be honest I dont mind... if I can get used to the SOS i got this in the bag
<Caramel> 2,14 you can't call yourself a brony if you don't enjoy this

<Golakka> This is me right now
<Golakka> http://images.smh.com.au/2009/08/17/682806/jets-420x0.jpg
<DB_Brony> JRP2234: I'll contact the milk carton company immediately
<Spell-of-Gaming> What the
<crazypony> G3 rolled
<Kandarihu> Something like that happens to me too.
<Kandarihu> Okay. Zalgo roulette. I stop the stream on...
<JRP2234> police are looking for her
<Tassadork> still better than g3 live?
<Golakka> G3.5 sweetiebelle is horror
<Kandarihu> NORMAL eyes!
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Dafuq is my brain doing?...
<panda> Caramel I ADMIT IT!!!!!!!! JUST STOP!
*Golakka dares Caramel to show soem G3.5
<MahBoi777> jesus how horrifying...
<Ninjazz|Depressed> HA! YOU LOSE panda!
<Ryunosuke> ya, had to shut that down :)
<Polydunami> Golakka, who?
<DeathStar> JRP2234: has she ever come on here?
<Golakka> caramel = val i belive :s
<Kandarihu> You know, I don't think this is going to get the people who hate Eureka 7 to like it more.
<EonMastor> sure it will
<Midnight_Tempest> so... we are still getting trolled... cool, cool...
<panda> Ninjazz|Depressed: no, i didnt loose!
*MahBoi777 gets into feetle position
<Googer12> Hello.
<Googer12> Anybody there?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> panda: You gave! You gave! :D
<crazypony> nyan cat
<panda> Ninjazz|Depressed: my life is more important!
<Kandarihu> EonMastor: this is torture. It only hardens the victims against the whims of the torturer.
<Ryunosuke> okay toss up question, which would you rather see, Battleship movie + Star Wars Ep. 1-3 3d or G3 ponies? >:)
<Polydunami> This isn't TOO bad...
*Tassadork does some stuff while scootaloo finishes her seisure
<DeathStar> oh mighty mod Caramel please deliver us from this monster
<thegt90> what did i return too
<Kandarihu> Oh, I tried the Zalgo roulette and came up with Zalgo
<EonMastor> enough torture, and the victims will crack
<hen3ry> THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS!
<Ninjazz|Depressed> panda: You lost then. :P
<MahBoi777> DELIVER US
<panda> Ninjazz|Depressed: no... you loose... you are risking your life
<crazypony> *cries* MAKE IT STTOOOOOPP
<Ninjazz|Depressed> panda: I has stream muted. :P
<Golakka> Dammit, I dont need a headache before i start a new job
<DaringDude> what did i come back to
<EonMastor> it will never stop
<DaringDude> :O
<Kammerjunk> I can see clearly now, the rain has gone.
<DaringDude> oh shit
<MahBoi777> RUN DaringDude!
<Kandarihu> If the victims are confined, they will say anything that the captors want in order to make the torture stop. In an interrogation, this can result in unreliable information.
<panda> Ninjazz|Depressed: as do I, but.... the image... burning my retinas
<Pinkies4thWall> WOOT
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 I NEED U ASAP
*DaringDude runs like hell
<DB_Brony> I feel ALIVE!
<Midnight_Tempest> oh Caramel... u so silly with the trolling...
<DaringDude> Pinkies4thWall: how do u live through this
<Kandarihu> However, we are not confined here. And I'm supposed to be sleeping. And so is my computer.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> panda: That's why you stare directly into chat... Do not give it... POWER.... RESIST...
<Ryunosuke> all those host closures :)
<MahBoi777> @﹏@
<Ryunosuke> and there goes saturn
<Polydunami> And there goes Saturn
<Polydunami> Yeah
<crazypony> *whimpers* ...make it end...
<Kandarihu> This is aesthetically offensive, but not morally offensive, so I have no reason to stick this out. Good night everypony. I'll see you in the morning, when someone decent is streaming.
<Kandarihu> One more Zalgo roulette.
<Ryunosuke> o/
<Polydunami> See you Kandarihu :)
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Gnight Kandarihu. Take care and sleep well.
<crazypony> bye Kandarihu
<MahBoi777> gnight Kandarihu!
<Kandarihu> I'm going to keep doing the roulette until it ends on normal eyes
<Ninjazz|Depressed> And pray Scootaloo stays away.
<Kriel_Pony> Goodnight Kandarihu
<Midnight_Tempest> i find this suitable punishment for people that complain during streams... i think it should be played everytime someone bitches during the stream
<Kriel_Pony> Midnight_Tempest: I just mute it and watch Anthology
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Midnight_Tempest: And have people like you and I get punished in the process?
<MahBoi777> I love the streams
<Polydunami> Oh my
<crazypony> i'm laughing and screaming at the same time
<DaringDude> thank gawd
<Midnight_Tempest> Ninjazz|Depressed: its the price we have to pay...
<MahBoi777> awwwwww
<Kandarihu> Midnight_Tempest: the problem is, this is punishing EVERYONE, including the people who were perfectly content earlier. And you have to admit that this is heavy handed.
<crazypony> yay
<DaringDude> its over!!!
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Midnight_Tempest: It's too steep...
<MahBoi777> Huzzah!
<Polydunami> Did I say something?
<RyunosukeKnT> hello applebloom, the 80's called :)
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Ey... This I can live with.
*MahBoi777 glomps DaringDude
<Midnight_Tempest> Kandarihu: there is a solution... turn off the stream, or mute it... problem solved
*DaringDude ish glomped
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz|Depressed: Actually I like this one
<EonMastor> yay, I am now officially a brony
<DaringDude> oh hai there buddy
<Golakka> My mind, Its full of fuck
<Caramel> 2,14 a solution some people find incredibly difficult
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Aye, Kriel_Pony.
<MahBoi777> I'M SO PROUD TT_TT
<RyunosukeKnT> well shit, now I have to go watch that video
<Golakka> Atleast it seperates the weat from the chaff Caramel
<RyunosukeKnT> to youtube!
<Midnight_Tempest> indeed Caramel...
<hen3ry> There are still fiv... four lights.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I'd think that you get used to it by the amount of times you show it, Val.
<Golakka> The torture was worth it for this :P
<Kandarihu> And this doesn't help for people who were waiting for Caramel to stream something else.
<MahBoi777> spin spin spin spin
<Caramel> 2,14 you're implying I was trying to fix anything

*panda bows to Caramel, "I offer you my soul"
<Kriel_Pony> can't... look... away....
<Ninjazz|Depressed> She's... hypnotizing...
<Kandarihu> A lot of people believe you were trying to fix the attitude of those who were complaining about Eureka 7, right?
<Midnight_Tempest> go AppleBloom go! get that tail!
<Polydunami> Umm
<Golakka> Oh sweet jesus
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<Modeabel> OH GOD
*Golakka fastens his seatbelt again

<Kriel_Pony> goddammit! heh
*Ninjazz|Depressed sighs
<Golakka> I want to get off mister bones wild ride
<Caramel> 2,14 I stream whatever I desire. And if I desire to stream this, I will. It's as simple as that
<crazypony> *laughs insanely*
<panda> AH!
<Kriel_Pony> Hmmm... still got Anthology qued up...

<panda> Caramel: well... you are the mod after all
<Polydunami> Huh?

<Modeabel> OH NO IT'S NOT WORKING
<Caramel> 2,14 rather than feel some god damn sense of entitlement towards people who spend countless hours of their time to provide FREE entertainment

<panda> Ryanier128: haha drinking makes me sleepy though
<Kriel_Pony> I SHOULD go to bed now, but... I will probably be here until my laptop gives out
<Ryanier128> panda I guess it's different for everypony. Mind you, I got drunk on my 18th birthday, so . . .
<panda> Kriel_Pony: aww :( but then we wont know when you are gone :(
<panda> Ryanier128: :) I've never really been dunk >.>

<Ryanier128> panda lucky bastard
<Kriel_Pony> I am allergic.
<panda> Kriel_Pony: :)
<Kriel_Pony> I actually break out in hives when I drink.

<hen3ry> Eddmario: not sure what you mean, but i found it with a google search.
<Eddmario> I mean was is JJ who created them?
<hen3ry> maybe not sure
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I don't think JJ does Pixel Art.
<Eddmario> Specifically, where did they come from?
<panda> SIMON!
<panda> aww missed it
<Tassadork> I cannot get over how over the top every single vanilla attack is in this game
<Kriel_Pony> Eddmario: I think he thought yo meant where did they come from on screen
<Ryanier128> panda never tried that before, I should write that down . . . Ritz or Soda Crackers?
<panda> Ryanier128: ginger snaps ^^
<Eddmario> I know Cteno was created by pony R34 artist Slugbox
<Tassadork> 'the fate of my soul rests on bashing this mook'
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Ohhhh Snap! :D
*Ninjazz|Depressed is getting more tired.
<Ryanier128> panda ugh, never mind. My stomach just doesn't agree with ginger
<panda> Ryanier128: well, when you are drunk it will XD
<Kriel_Pony> panda: doesnt your stomach tend to get less agreeable when drunk?
<MahBoi777> must stay awake =_=
<Cave_Tempest> people that are tired should sleep...
<panda> Kriel_Pony: yes, with other things. Its like when you are sea sick or car sick. eat some ginger snaps or drink ginger ale and it will take away that feeling
<Eddmario> The person currently streaming should stream some Megas XLR episodes one night.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> NEVAH!

<Kriel_Pony> crazypony: Night!

<Ninjazz|Depressed> Flare, you're here?

<Ryanier128> FlareChaser . . . I don't know if I'm repelled or attracted to that pic . . .
<FlareChaser> panda: why the sad face? me and Colgate talked about it and we're all happy.
<MahBoi777> I don't have nightmares often, but when I do they're quite random
<Ryanier128> FlareChaser nevermind Samantha just slapped me across the face
<Kriel_Pony> Major_Frank: Try having a dram about ritual scarification and then having your arm be numb where the cuts were and backing up that claim.
<panda> FlareChaser: :( i just know she didnt want it to end that way ^^
<Major_Frank> Thanks for the tip Kriel_Pony will try :)
<Kriel_Pony> Major_Frank: Not trying to be depressing or anything. Sleep really jsut isnt pleasant for me.
<FlareChaser> panda: alas, I didnt either. but me and Tavi are happy now ~<3

<Kriel_Pony> CrimsonPhoenix: Well, thank you! I don't really know you very well but I think I like you too. I generally like people. Glass half full type.
<Ghosties> 04Yes, I suppose that makes sense Kriel
<Ghosties> 04In any case
<Midnight_Tempest> there are no sane people here... at least im not sane, i could snap and try to hunt you all down at any moment :)
<BlueFlare> 02was jk XD
<Ghosties> 04Does anybody here have Steam
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh yeah I haven't introduce myself, where are my manners
<Midnight_Tempest> i do Ghosties
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I got Steam.
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: I do, in fact.
<Ghosties> 04Does anybody here have Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic through Steam?
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: i do

<Saturn> DaringDude: haha, dat implying i actually went to sleep.
<Vinyer> gah going to be another hard and boring night
<DaringDude> lol
<Ghosties> 04Well then
<Ghosties> 04I'm shit out of luck

<Ninjazz|Depressed> I'm freakin tired as hell...
<DaringDude> wait what? o////o
<Midnight_Tempest> how so Ghosties? trying to find someone that can tell you how to mod it?
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz|Depressed: Any reason you can't sleep?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Kriel_Pony: Just me fighting it off. Not really.
<Saturn> 8,1DeathStar: i'm always naked

<Saturn> 8,1under my clothes, especially
<DaringDude> oh my o////o
<DaringDude> O U Saturn
<DeathStar> Saturn: oh my O////////O
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Why you don't have clothes under your clothes?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Fix the problems.
<BlueFlare> 02I was, it wouldn't have gone anywhere near him xD
<Midnight_Tempest> clothesception
*Saturn 8,1hugs Ninjazz|Depressed
*Ninjazz|Depressed hugs Saturn back
<Kriel_Pony> what about clothes under underclothes?
<DaringDude> chastity belt?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Wait... Am I in danger?
<Saturn> 8,1looks like somepony got a visit from the Depression Clown
<Kriel_Pony> Still naked under that.
<DeathStar> Ninjazz|Depressed: I think Saturn likes being naked though
<Saturn> 8,1i love being naked
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Ahahah. I see you noticed.
<Saturn> 8,1except when i'm cold
<Kriel_Pony> DeathStar: Who doesn't?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Thanks for that.
<Saturn> 8,1which is most of the time
<DaringDude> when i was younger my parents couldntt keep my clothes on me XD
<Saturn> 8,1i don't think my internal heating system works too well
<Ghosties> 04<Midnight_Tempest> how so Ghosties? trying to find someone that can tell you how to mod it? <-- Well see, I downloaded the Brotherhood of Shadow mod and patch and while it took me a while to find the TSL Patcher I did and got everything squared away...or so I though
<Ghosties> 04*thought
<Vinyer> it should have
<Ghosties> 04Truth is that about a minute or so after I load my game it doesn't just crash my game, it doesn't just exit the software
<Vinyer> according to my sources, the only part of the country (besides alaska and hawaii) that wouldn't have been able to see it was the east coast
*DaringDude sleeps on that wall of red text
<Ghosties> 04It shuts my whole damn computer off
<Ninjazz|Depressed> O_O
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Daayuum.
<Ghosties> 04I know
<Midnight_Tempest> hmm... wow... thats one hell of a bug
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: Hmmm. And it is only in KoTOR wit hthe mod?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Indeed.
<Ghosties> 04And nobody has reported a problem like that
*Ascendant slaps Kyu
<Ghosties> 04Yes, with the mod
<Ascendant> go fix the stats page
<Ghosties> 04Everything else is operating normally
<Kyubree> 07do whatnow?
<Ghosties> 04But the mod looks like it installed properly and everything
<DaringDude> well night everypony nd Ghosties hope u fix dat problem soo :)
<Midnight_Tempest> strange... do you have the most up to date version of the mod?
<DaringDude> soon
<Ghosties> 04My game doesn't look any different
<Ghosties> 04Doesn't run slower or lag or anything
<Kriel_Pony> night DaringDude
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Gnight DaringDude! Take care. Rarity. :|
<Ghosties> 04And yes, I have the most up to date version of the mod
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: When does it crash?
<DaringDude> zzzz....
<Kyubree> 07uh
<Ghosties> 04About a minute or so after I load my game
<Kyubree> 07how
<Kyubree> 07o3o
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties... can you tell me the version number of the mod?
<junh1024-XD> o3o
<Kriel_Pony> Okay... have you tried going different directions or using different loads for that minute?
<Saturn> 8,1DeathStar: have you ever destroyed a planet/
<DuskStarshimmer> can I get a hug in here?
*Saturn 8,1hugs DuskStarshimmer
<DeathStar> Saturn: <.< >.> nooooo

*Kriel_Pony hugs DuskStarshimmer in an awkward stranger way
<DuskStarshimmer> xD
<Ascendant> ._.
<Kyubree> 07I can only change the pages that have an edit button |D
<DeathStar> Saturn: darth vader made me :'(
<DuskStarshimmer> just kiddin,

<Ascendant> http://www.lugia.us/forum/help-and-feedback/user-stats-page-is-relatively-messed-up-for-me/msg293500/
*DuskStarshimmer bear hugs all who hugged me
<Ascendant> You should have enough permissions to modify pages in the admin panel on the SMF forum
<Kyubree> 07oh
<Saturn> 8,1DeathStar: so what you're saying is that Darth Vader... *sunglasses*... is your father?
<Saturn> 8,1YEAAAAAAAAAAH
<Kyubree> 07THAT stats page
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Ghosties> 04@Midnight_Tempest: Appears to be 1.0
<Ascendant> I can fix the IRC stats page myself
<Ascendant> Since that's under my jurisdiction
<Saturn> 8,1DuskStarshimmer: are you okay?
<Ascendant> And speaking of that
<Ascendant> I should actually go fix it
<DeathStar> Saturn: yes that's exactly what I'm saying...(anijoke chicken pic here)
<DuskStarshimmer> I've just configuered my very own Unreal IRCd, :D Now I get to play with all sorts of neat intercommunicatory mumbo jumbogous things
<BlueFlare> 02see, that's where drf lives
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<Onyxia> mornin bronystate
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: then that might be your problem...
<DeathStar> anti*
<DuskStarshimmer> Saturn, I assure you I am just peachy.
<Saturn> 8,1DuskStarshimmer: awesome
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hey Onyxia!
<Saturn> 8,1Ninjazz|Depressed: are you okay?
<Ghosties> 04If that is indeed the case then why hasn't it been updated :/
<Saturn> 8,1i mean, obviously, you're depressed
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Could be better, Saturn.
<DuskStarshimmer> or right sleep, always right when I want to code; Goodnight BronyState
<Saturn> 8,1but is there anything i can do to help?
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: try this, this is supposed to be the v1.07 patch for it... http://derpy.me/zVGdQ
<Saturn> 8,1night DuskStarshimmer
<Vinyer> no
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Nah, man. I just need some time to cheer up is all. :)
<Vinyer> he lives in michigan
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: should be some patch fixes in there
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Gnight DuskStarshimmer!
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Take care.
<Ascendant> Ah yes Kyu
<DuskStarshimmer> thanks Saturn! Your way better then the ops on eqd; Brony state is just soo much better than eqd
<Ascendant> I was correct
<Ascendant> The % stuff shouldn't be showing
<Ascendant> It's an easy fix
<Kriel_Pony1> Bah... stupid lockup... once again have th 1...
<Ascendant> oh wait
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Wow. We're better than EqD now.
<Ascendant> actually yeah
<Saturn> 8,1IT'S OFFICIAL
<DuskStarshimmer> Deffo Ninjazz|Depressed, this place kicks EQD's arse
<Saturn> 8,1WE'RE BETTER THAN EQD.
<Midnight_Tempest> wow...
<Ninjazz|Depressed> HUZZAH!
<Midnight_Tempest> better than EQD...
<DuskStarshimmer> Yay my oppinion is arbitartilly official!
<Midnight_Tempest> we need a party
<Midnight_Tempest> right now
<Ascendant> the "# posts" part shouldn't be showing
<Ascendant> that's what is screwing it up
<Ghosties> 04Thanks for that Duskstar
<DuskStarshimmer> Party? But i was gunna sleeeeeep
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Damn this chat and its low participants.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> WAKE UP!
<DuskStarshimmer> Quality over quantity Ninjazz|Depressed
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Oh. I see.
<DeathStar> Saturn: I perfer bronystate but I can't say it's better because they arnt for the same thing....
<Midnight_Tempest> i should be in bed myself... but im not tired yet, i will be soon though
<Onyxia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tigQMK-P9kk&feature=related check this you

<Onyxia> i said check this you O_O wta
<DuskStarshimmer> I only compare unlike things, why else compare things?
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: I got kicked for a bit there. any progress?
<DuskStarshimmer> Brony state is like television, and eqd is like the newspaper
<DuskStarshimmer> television wins every time
<DuskStarshimmer> untill the internet.
<BlueFlare> 02oh
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I can see the comparrison.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> And you know... I don't go to EqD NEARLY as much as I come here.
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: hope what i sent you helps the problem...
<Phase4> finaly at home
<DuskStarshimmer> yeah and EQD chat is always dead or borin g
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hey, Phase4!
<DuskStarshimmer> here its always lively and alive
<Kriel_Pony> I still check EQD, you know, daily.
<Kyubree> 07yeah
<ResonantWaves> o_____o how are you everypony!
<Kyubree> 07still trying to find where that is lol
<DuskStarshimmer> I only went ot eqd for the chat, but sicne i got an irc client I have no need for their silly ajax/flash thing
<Ghosties> 04I appreciate the link, but it appears it was an outdated patch and the one I used on the mod is the most up to date one
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7Z0apgiCZU anyone else remember this?
*DuskStarshimmer awkwarly hugs ResonantWaves and leave the room, saluting 'goodnight'
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Ohey ResonantWaves!
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Cya DuskStarshimmer!
<Phase4> ohai Ninjazz|Depressed
<Ascendant> Actually
<Phase4> later DuskStarshimmer
<Ascendant> That should be there
<Kriel_Pony> goodnight DuskStarshimmer|out
<Ninjazz|Depressed> :)
<Ascendant> But it's a <span>
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> anyone remeber code lyoko?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Yes, I do.
<Phase4> i saw a little of it
<DuskStarshimmer|out> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, hell yes
<Kriel_Pony> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Yes, but not much
<DuskStarshimmer|out> but i must go to sleep, talk to me in 10 to 12 hours
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Go to sleep DuskStarshimmer|out! :D
<DuskStarshimmer|out> fine
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> man i loved that show
<DuskStarshimmer|out> fine!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> if you remeber the Code Lyoko then http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3_pmn2r8yY&feature=related
<DeathStar> night DuskStarshimmer|inso
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: ok... well... this Brotherhood of Shadows... is it just that or is it also the Solomon's Revenge mod?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Theres a fifth season coming out in October
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> and apparently its not just cgi theres live action as well
<Ascendant> hm
<Ghosties> 04Solomon's Revenge mod
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Live Action?...
<Ninjazz|Depressed> No thanks.
<Phase4> windows! y u screw up clock so bad
<Dusk|Alseepish> Audiose Phase4!
<Kyubree> 07I've gone through most of the options
<Kyubree> 07all I can find is a check box that enables/disables user stats |D
<DeathStar> Phase4: use this clock http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2507/
<Phase4> XD
<Kriel_Pony> DeathStar: It is always accurate.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> shhh that blasphemy in these parts
<Ninjazz|Depressed> The joke is that Dash is always shipped! :D
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: ok... Solomon's Revenge... lets see here... and try this patch for it http://derpy.me/fl98t
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: should make it v1.1
<Phase4> DeathStar, XD
<Ascendant> It's not an option
<Ascendant> You have to edit the CSS files
<Phase4> DeathStar, i actualy thought that would be the ponies or party clocks, and i'd find the images except mlfw's search appears to be broken right now
<Ascendant> I'm trying to find the exact problem atm
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz|Depressed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7Z0apgiCZU
<Ascendant> and god the hooh theme CSS files are messy as hell
<Ascendant> http://www.lugia.us/forum/Themes/ho-oh/css/index.css
<Ascendant> dat spacing
<Saturn> 8,1i don't think i'll ever find love in this shitty shit hole of a town
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Nostalgia does not help my mood, Shane.
*Phase4 hugs Saturn
<DeathStar> Phase4: it's better when it's not expected :)
<Midnight_Tempest> i know that feel Saturn...
<Ghosties> 04Tempest, that's the original patch that I downloaded
<Saturn> 8,1if i was younger, maybe
<Phase4> DeathStar, true dat
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: damn...
<Ghosties> 04So it should be completely up to date now
<Saturn> 8,1but St Andrews is not the place for someone in their mid 20s
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Time to move?
<Ghosties> 04And apparently nobody has experienced the same problem I have...it's maddening
<Saturn> 8,1it's a place for kids and freshers
<Ascendant> Kyu
<Ascendant> I found it
<Ghosties> 04I just want to breathe some damn life into my game but for some reason I can't -_-
<Ascendant> Search for .activity_stats li div.bar span in the index.css file
<DeathStar> Saturn: that's sounds weard because I live in st andrews but in NZ
<Saturn> 8,1Midnight_Tempest: well, the obvious solution here is for us to hook up.
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: Normally I would ask for your system specs but since KoTOR is pretty old I will asumme you are set
<Ascendant> and change -1820C0Bem to -1000em
<Saturn> 8,1DeathStar: i'm in the Scottish one
<DeathStar> Saturn: yeah I guessed
<DeathStar> Saturn: maybe you should try this one :)
<Saturn> 8,1DeathStar: well, the obvious solution here is for us to hook up.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> lol
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, my system can run the game just fine
<Ninjazz|Depressed> O U Saturn! :D
<DeathStar> Saturn: of corse
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: the only problem i can really think of is... it might be a conflict with steam as well...
<Ghosties> 04I'm just trying to figure out why in the hell it turns my whole laptop completely off
<Midnight_Tempest> Saturn: maybe... maybe...
<Ghosties> 04But then why would it completely shut down my computer?
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: So, ruling out hardware because it is only the one game, and it is shutting down the whole computer, which is... extreme, in the best of cases. Have you tried some of the easy fixes, like running in compatibility mode?
<Ghosties> 04No, I haven't considered that
<Saturn> 8,1loveless and lonely? hook up with Saturn.
<Ghosties> 04I wouldn't know how, Kriel
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> this video is a perfect example of me after i get killed by someone in a video game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cspLMB0OjM0&feature=plcp
<Kriel_Pony> What OS?
<Saturn> 8,1marriage gone to pot? hook up with Saturn
<DeathStar> Ghosties: it's not over heating you computer is it? (I may be wrong)
<Ghosties> 04Windows 7
<Saturn> 8,1game crashes your whole machine? hook up with Saturn.
<Kyubree> 07I should probably also ask how to get to index.css in the first place lol
<Ghosties> 04No it can't be, it's only for that game
<Ascendant> er sec
<Ninjazz|Depressed> lol
<DeathStar> Saturn: it's the solution to everything
<Saturn> 8,1indeed
<Ascendant> Go to Configuration -> Themes and Layout
<Ascendant> Then Modify Themes
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: Okay, with seven, right clikc on the link to the game (Or maybie steam, I am admittedly not sure, I dont use steam a whole lot)
<Saturn> 8,1except an overabundance of hooking up
<Ascendant> I have no idea which themes have that screwed up
<DeathStar> feel like beer grills? hook up with Saturn
<Ascendant> So you'll most likely need to go through all of them
<BlueFlare> 02Ohai NS
<Saturn> 8,1better hook up with Saturn
<Ascendant> I would also suggest copying everything inside the file
<Phase4> ok, that should start in a second
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: either way, right click, properties, compatibility, then click the mark for "Run in compatibility mode" for windows XP
<Phase4> there we go
<Ascendant> before editing
<Ghosties> 04Hmm, alright, I'll give it a try
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: it might be a windows 7 problem... i know Kotor doesnt like it at all
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Stream is up, Phase4.
<Kriel_Pony> Some older games run better if windows is running what basically comes down to an emulator of an old OS
<DeathStar> Saturn: new brony state meme away!
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Oh I see you aleady knew that.
<Ascendant> Anyway, have fun Kyu, tis' the index.css file, I'm going to shower then piano, will be back in 1-2 hours
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I can see that meme happening.
<DeathStar> Ninjazz|Depressed: I may accedentlly force it :)
<Ninjazz|Depressed> :D
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Either way, NEW MEME! WOO
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH MY GOD
<DeathStar> need a new meme better hook up with Saturn
<CrimsonPhoenix> BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL
<BlueFlare> 02seeya NS
<Kriel_Pony> Never played this game
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Stream lagging better hook up with Saturn
<Phase4> ?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Oh no no no no! Just saying. :D
<Kriel_Pony> people complaining better hook up with Saturn
<DeathStar> Phase4: confused? better hook up with Saturn
<Ninjazz|Depressed> lol
<Phase4_> is the stream actualy lagging or is it a joke?
<dshannon> oh snap
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Joke.
<XAX> mah chat
<Kriel_Pony> Phase4: Joke
<XAX> iz on he screen
<XAX> :D
<XAX> lolol
<DeathStar> Ninjazz|Depressed: ok lets not over do this right away
<Ninjazz|Depressed> DeathStar: Yeah. :D
<Kriel_Pony> over doing it? Better hook up with saturn
<Ghosties> 04You know, I wonder if Steam doesn't like cheating in Kotor
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Stean doesn't like having fun.
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: Still no luck?
*junh1024-XD f2k Utah Symphony Orchestra - March (6chFLAC@3467kbps, 60.98mb/2:27)
<Phase4_> i'll just take a photo and then go collect the money
<DeathStar> Ninjazz|Depressed: or people might get annoyed like with otakon shipping
<Phase4_> nothing will go wrongf
<Phase4_> wrong'
<Ghosties> 04Because when I downloaded Solomon's Revenge it came with a save that's right at the Sith Academy where the beginning of the mod takes place
<XAX> Phase4: play soem tf2 later :D
<Ghosties> 04And it has a "Cheat" message typed across the picture of the save
<Ninjazz|Depressed> DeathStar: But you see, otakon doesn't like it... Saturn on the other hand...
<Ghosties> 04And I actually can't find the option to run Kotor in XP
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: that could be a problem... though i didnt think the Kotor was VAC protected...
<Kriel_Pony> Ah
<DeathStar> Ninjazz|Depressed: true but he might get anyed by thing pings after a bit
<Kriel_Pony> Gimme a minute, gotta boot up my desktop where I have steam
<Kriel_Pony> ill see if i can find that for you
<Kyubree> 07right
<Kyubree> 07so that doesn't fix it
<Ninjazz|Depressed> DeathStar: Very true, very true. Should we stop?
<DeathStar> Ninjazz|Depressed: not stop just space them out a bit
<Midnight_Tempest> Ghosties: were you able to run Kotor before installing the mod?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> DeathStar: Right. Let's just chill out for now and wait for the best moments.
<Phase4_> HE"S FINE
<Phase4_> whoops caps
<dshannon> lol
<dshannon> facepalm
<DeathStar> why is the pig guy so bad at fighting?
<Ghosties> 04Yep, I was able to run the game perfectly
<DeathStar> YAY!
*DeathStar gives Ghosties a congratualatory muffin
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: Okay, so it looks like compatibility mode is run for Steam itself, not the game
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hey DeathStar Don't you dare talk bad about Pey'j
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: So, exit steam, then right click on the steam icon
<DeathStar> CrimsonPhoenix: oh ok sorry :'(
<Ghosties> 04Alright, and then?
<dshannon> and she put that thing where?
<Phase4lA> Cadelac.XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> in her computer
<Ninjazz|Depressed> :O
<dshannon> -_-
<Ninjazz|Depressed> It's Meanwhile again!
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: Select properties
<DeathStar> dshannon: in her back pocket like a cartoon charictor
<DeathStar> *but spelling
<Ghosties> 04Okay
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: There should be a Compatibility tab
<dshannon> wait wait wait....isn't that ff7 stuff there?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> bbl. Got to get something to eat.
<DeathStar> cya Ninjazz|Depressed
<Midnight_Tempest> hmm... see, i have the problem of Kotor not running on my PC for some reason...
<Kriel_Pony> cya Ninjazz|Depressed
<Phase4_> hmm, audio bug seems to have fixed itself
<Phase4_> how's the sound btw?
<DeathStar> Midnight_Tempest: kotor not running on your pc? better hook up with Saturn
<Midnight_Tempest> DeathStar: hmm... nah... would rather hook up with you *winks*
<DeathStar> Midnight_Tempest: oh you
<Ghosties> 04Alright, I'm in compatibility
<Midnight_Tempest> DeathStar: cant blame a guy for trying...
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: In the tab or set in compatibility mode?
<DeathStar> Midnight_Tempest: actually you can because he chose to try...but anyway...look a game
<Ghosties> 04In the tab?
<Phase4_> huh, camera wont work there
<Midnight_Tempest> DeathStar: ouch...
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: Okay. about a 3rd down the page there should be a check box
*DeathStar hugs Midnight_Tempest "you know your wubed"
<Ghosties> 04Run this program in compatibility mode for:?
<Kriel_Pony> Ghosties: yup. Click that and set the dropdown to windows XP
<Kriel_Pony> SP3 should be fine
<Ghosties> 04Hokay
<Kriel_Pony> okay. When you run it, it should run in XP compatibility mode
<Ghosties> 04Done
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> OMG stream? whose streaming?
<Ghosties> 04And that *should* work, yes?
<Kriel_Pony> hopefully
*Ghosties sighs
<Phase4_> should i play the minigasme?
<Ghosties> 04Man, I hope so
<Phase4_> minigame'
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> whose playing?
*Phase4_ is

<Phase4_> looks safe

<junh1024-XD> depenz if they DDoS and hammer you

<Ascendant> idk
<Ascendant> it should be able to handle quite a bit
<Twi_Fi> huh
<Twi_Fi> yay
<Ascendant> why is this?
<junh1024-XD> 'i'd say 33,333 browses? assuming 3MB per visit
<junh1024-XD> of visiting and viewing a few pages
<BlueFlare> 02I just was comparing free hosting to paid
<BlueFlare> 02most free hosting is 100GB
<Ascendant> well 100GB should be able to handle quite a lot of visitors
<Ascendant> but free hosting is crap
<Ascendant> why would you use it
<Twi_Fi> <_<
<Twi_Fi> >_>
<Twi_Fi> Pigman is just trying to get eaten.

<XAX> Ghosties: What did that game do to you to put you in such a mood? :(
<Ghosties> 04Was I yelling at a fucking brick wall or something?
<Ghosties> 04Huh?
<RaveBrony> Ghosties: Oh damn.... >.<

<Phase4_> Ghosties: what happened?
<XAX> ^
<Ninjazz|Depressed> You guys weren't here when Midnight and Ghosties tried to get Kotor working?
<Twi_Fi> nope
<Twi_Fi> At least I wasn't.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> He's trying to get a mod working. So far, it's only been turning off his computer on initiation.
<alexxm> first i've heard of this Ninjazz|Depressed
<Ghosties> 04Is Kriel still here?
<Ghosties> 04I wanna chew his fucking head off
<Ninjazz|Depressed> No, man. He left.
<dshannon> ?
<Vordox> Ghosties...
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Vordox> Listen to Smile Smile Smile
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> And I guess good for him too...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> shh Vordox
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Why? Was his advice shit?
<alexxm> the hell did he do Ghosties
<dshannon> lol phase has no comment
<Oatz> Watch the Massive Smile Project PMV that BronyDanceParty made
<Ghosties> 04He told me to run the game in compatibility mode, and I almost lost my fucking hard drive because of him and his advice
<Oatz> impossible not to smile
<Ghosties> 04I am so goddamn pissed right now
<RaveBrony> Holy hell...
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I'm sure he didn't mean no harm, man.
<Ghosties> 04I get that
<Ghosties> 04But it doesn't mean that I don't want to just wring his neck
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Aye.
<Ghosties> 04AND WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE FUCKING MODS
<Ghosties> 04HUH
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Sleeping, I guess.
*Ghosties is about ready to fucking kill somebody
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Sumi and Saturn are asleep for sure.
<alexxm> kill all the rats
<Twi_Fi> O_O
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> SuperBrony64|Zzz: is asleep
<Ghosties> 04I feel like motherfucking Val
<Ghosties> 04Ready to set someone on fucking fire
<Ninjazz|Depressed> You can kick me if that helps! :)
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Twi_Fi> Ninjazz|Depressed: NOOOOOOOOO
<Vordox> Did you lose anything Ghosties?
<Ghosties> 04I'm not sure yet
<Ghosties> 04My computer was very slow upon reboot
<Vordox> Do a scan and things. =/
<Ghosties> 04I don't have any virus protection though
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Shit. Sounds more serrious than I thought.
<Phase4_> ah, thats a shortcut
<Oatz> Least your OS wasent lost
<XAX> Antivirus
<Vordox> Meant a scandisk
<XAX> Who needs it?
<RaveBrony> Oh damn >.<
<Phase4_> Ghosties: avast, its one of the best free ones
<Vordox> To check for damage
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Aye. Checking for damage might be a good first step.
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Ghosties> 04I don't know HOW to check
<Phase4_> Ghosties: as for slowness, download process explorer, its a free thing from microsoft, much better than task manager
<Vordox> Ghosties, Press Window + R
<Phase4_> it'll show you whats stealing cpu power
<XAX> Ghosties: so what actually happened when you started the game with compatibility mode on?
<Vordox> Bah forgot the short command
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Okay... Before we get Ghosties computer in deep shit again. Make sure you have Windows 7 before you start giving him advice and what not.
<Vordox> brb
<Ghosties> 04It ran for a bit and then system shut down again
<Ninjazz|Depressed> You know, maybe that mod ain't worth it...
<Ghosties> 04So then I tried to boot the system again
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Ghosties> 04And then it shut down almost immediately
<Ghosties> 04So then I turned it on *again*
<Phase4_> ah, that sounds like a detached cpu cooler
<Vordox> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/156571
<Ghosties> 04And then before I could read the safe text it shut down *a.g.a.i.n.*
<Phase4_> it should shut itself down before it dies
<Ghosties> 04So at that particular point and time I'm freaking the fuck out
<Phase4_> Vordox: its a hardware porblem
<Ghosties> 04Bells are going off in my head, "WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!!!!!"
<Vordox> Ghosties: How long was it cooled down to reset the FLASH mem?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> lol
<Ghosties> 04I DON'T FUCKING KNOW
<Ghosties> 04I'M NOT COMPUTER SAVVY
<Ghosties> 04SAVVY?
<Vordox> Hmm
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Okay dude.
<Wrek> 05i say kill its power
<XAX> You make angry situations humorous Ghosties.
<Ghosties> 04Well no shit
<Wrek> 05open the case and see if its warm
<Vordox> Same wrek, cool it down.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Did this start after trying the mod to work?
<Ghosties> 04Do..what?
<Wrek> 05note what parts are the warmest
<RaveBrony> ^
<Ghosties> 04My entire computer is hot
<Ghosties> 04Well
<Ghosties> 04Not all of it
<Wrek> 05yes but the source, need to find the source
<Ghosties> 04Only the left half is hot
<Ghosties> 04I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
<Ghosties> 04SPEAK ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER
<Wrek> 05skype then?
<RaveBrony> :o
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> :O
<Ghosties> 04Listen to me

<Ghosties> 04Do not
<Ghosties> 04Fuck with me
<Ghosties> 04Right
<Ghosties> 04Now
<Ghosties> 04I swear to fucking god, I will ban your ass
<Ghosties> 04I have already lost my goddamn computer once
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Ghosties> 04I don't want to lose it again
<Wrek> 05instead, do as I say. unplug any power if you havent. and open the case
<Ghosties> 04What are you talking about
<Wrek> 05the lid on the side of your computer case
<Phase4_> its a heat problem most likley
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Doesn't he have a laptop?
<Ghosties> 04Yes, I'm using a laptop
<RaveBrony> ^
<Wrek> 05oh even better
<Wrek> 05what brand?
<Ghosties> 04Gateway
<TrixieMuffin> hey im back , had a powercut for repairs on the complex earlier .... why are you in danger of loosing your rig ?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Somehow this song is fitting so well...
<Vordox> Ninjazz|Depressed: Musics in Beyond GOod and Evil <3
<Wrek> 05do you know the exact model type?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hey TrixieMuffin.
<Trixie> Hey Everypony
<alexxm> hey TrixieMuffin hows your day been
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Vordox: It's great! :)
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hi Trixie.
<alexxm> hey Trixie hows your day been
<Twi_Fi> Hello Trixie and TrixieMuffin.
<Trixie> Goood
<Wrek> 05like "gateway super ninja turtle 5"
<Phase4_> Ghosties: let it sit for ~20 minutes and then turn it on again
<TrixieMuffin> my day 's been cleany uppy because no power and nothing betterto do!
<Phase4_> if it lasts longer your cooler has died
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, hello everypony. I'll only be on for a while.
<Ghosties> 04Will you all listen to me
<Trixie> Hey TheRainbowDash
<Wrek> 05only if you listen to be ghosties
<alexxm> hey TheRainbowDash hows your day been
<Ghosties> 04I have run this computer multiple times for very long periods of time
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Duck in cover, TheRainbowDash.
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Ah, going good, and you?
<TheRainbowDash> (ducks in cover)
<Ghosties> 04Not once has it EVER done anything like that, and it only does it when I install a mod on Kotor
<RaveBrony> Hey TheRainbowDash :)
<alexxm> i'm good TheRainbowDash
<Trixie> (ducks lazor)
<Trixie> victory
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Trixie: shhh
<Twi_Fi> Hello TheRainbowDash.
<Vordox> It was a memory leak then, that caused an overheating.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> TheRainbowDash: shhhh
<Ghosties> 04And even the other times when I booted it back up after Kotor killed my laptop, it didn't fuck up anymore until I tried to run Kotor again
<TheRainbowDash> (is quiet)
<Ghosties> 04It's too coincidental
<Trixie> kotor?
<Ghosties> 04Way too coincidental
<Ghosties> 04It has to be the mod
<Ghosties> 04Has to be
<Ghosties> 04Only Kotor destroyed it
<Vordox> Do not uninstall Kotor yet
<Wrek> 05did it run fine without the mod? then yes most likley the mod
<Ghosties> 04Yes, it ran just fine without them od
<Ghosties> 04*the mod
<Trixie> TheRainbowDash you said when you got back we will gonna have good hoof fun rember?
<alexxm> Ghosties no offense but how about not installing mods
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Didn't it forced your computer to turn off? Must have caused some damage here and there.
<TheRainbowDash> Trixie: Oh, I remember...(winks*
<Ghosties> 04Trust me, I won't be installing mods for Kotor ever again
<Wrek> 05you aint helping alexxm
<Trixie> (winks)
<alexxm> sorry Wrek
<Wrek> 05ok now
*RaveBrony bonks alexxm on the noggin
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Let's all take a moment to breath here...
<Ghosties> 04I've even uninstalled the game from my computer
<Wrek> 05we know that something probably overheated due to the behaviour
<Ghosties> 04If it overheated, it came from the processes of the mod
<alexxm> bye guys
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> bai alexxm
<Phase4_> later alexxm
<Wrek> 05or memory. anyways. was the crashign instant?
<Wrek> 05like
<Wrek> 05run the exe and boom
<Ghosties> 04No
<Wrek> 05good
<Ghosties> 04I run the game, game loads, I play, two minutes later *system dead*
<Phase4_> Wrek: tell me when you want to take over, i'll try get to the next save point
<Vordox> How do you mean "System dead"
<Ghosties> 04Like
<Ghosties> 04Dead
<Vordox> Shut down?
<Ghosties> 04Not "game crashes"
<Ghosties> 04Not even shut down
<Trixie> .....
<Vordox> O.o
<Wrek> 05my best guess right now would be to let the laptp atleast reach room temperature
<Ghosties> 04I'm talking just "dead"
<TrixieMuffin> Frozen screen no more reaction ?
<Ghosties> 04No
<Ghosties> 04Dead
<Ghosties> 04As in
<Ghosties> 04The whole computer suddenly shuts off
<Ghosties> 04No shut down, no nothing
<Ghosties> 04Just off
<Vordox> Ah...
<Phase4_> leeave it off for 20 min
<Phase4_> if that doesnt work then its more serious
<Ghosties> 04...I'm not turning this off
<Ghosties> 04NOt right now
<Wrek> 05dont set a time limit Phase4
<dshannon> ......
<Vordox> Ghosties: You need to cool down the circuit.
<Wrek> 05it needs to cool as low as possible
<Ghosties> 04I'm on my laptop right now, and it's fine
<Vordox> Or it'll most likely melt by now.
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Trixie> What are u guys talking about
<TrixieMuffin> i dont get the difference between shut down and shut off ?
<XAX> Read ._.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> SHUSH
<Vordox> Trixie: Circuitary damage
<RaveBrony> Trixie: Ghost got a mod for Kotor and it messed up his comp
<Ghosties> 04Listen, please, you're fucking scaring me right now
<Ghosties> 04My computer has never had this problem
<Ghosties> 04It only started with the mod
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Calm down, Ghosties. Just calm down.
<Vordox> Ghosties: And that's why you should let it cool off. It's the faster and safer way.
<Ghosties> 04THEN STOP FUCKING TELLING ME MY GODDAMN COMPUTER IS GOING TO FUCKING MELT
<dshannon> it might just come with age
<Vordox> IT HASN'T MELTED YET.
<Ghosties> 04STOP
<Ghosties> 04FUCKING STOP
<Vordox> It's still functional, as you notice.
<Ghosties> 04I don't want to risk it
<Ghosties> 04Do you understand
<Ghosties> 04I'm scared
<Wrek> 05ok so the laptop is currently on?
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Wrek> 05and its not acting up yet?
<Ghosties> 04No
<Wrek> 05get rid of the mod asap, once it is gone. let your computer rest and cool down.
<Wrek> 05no uneccesary risks you know
<Wrek> 05and as in rest i dont mean just let it stand there, i mean beign completly off.
<Phase4_> Ghosties: its not going to melt
<Wrek> 05from what you have told me.
<Phase4_> theres a tempreture sensor on the cpu
<Ghosties> 04I did, I got rid of the mod
<Wrek> 05nice.
<Wrek> 05now what I would do would be to turn off the laptop so that the extra heat caused by the mod is gone
<Wrek> 05since it seems to be out of the danger zone, 10-20 minutes would suffice
<Wrek> 05(danger zone as in not shutting down on you again)
<Ghosties> 04Wrek's what's an IFO file
<Wrek> 05The IFO file type is primarily associated with 'DVD Info File'. An info file associated with a .VRO video file. The .VRO file contains the video stream and the .IFO file contains various scene and timing information. This is different from a .VOB file where that information is included in the file. Several manufacturers use .VRO/.IFO files. If present, the file VIDEO_TS.IFO consists of
<Wrek> 5control and playback information for the entire DVD. VIDEO_TS.IFO is known as VMGI (The Video Manager Information file). This file is required to be present on a DVD-compliant disc.
<Ghosties> 04So then it's nothing dangerous?
<Wrek> 05Other applications associated with file type IFO:
<Wrek> 05BioWare Aurora Engine (Information File) by BioWare Corp.An IFO file is a module InFOrmation file. Every NWN module (.MOD or .NWM) or savegame (.SAV) is an Encapsulated Resource File (ERF) that contains an IFO file called "module.ifo". The IFO file type is in BioWare's Generic File Format (GFF).
<Ghosties> 04Okay...alright
<Wrek> 05its liek ESP for skyrim
<Wrek> 05the general file format of the game engine
<Wrek> 05oh right
<Ghosties> 04Wrek
<Ghosties> 04Listen to me
<Ghosties> 04I'm going to turn my computer off soon
<Ghosties> 04But
<Ghosties> 04I want you to be on skype
<Ghosties> 04Seriously
<Ghosties> 04Please
<XAX> And we're back. Hope all goes well with the computer Ghosties.

<Phase4_> i found another bug
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Not good, XAX...
<Wrek> 05ill be here and probably drawing
<Twi_Fi> The parting of the red sea.
<Ghosties> 04I want you to keep looking at Skype

<doughnutjoe> I wonder how the wonderbolts get into their suits...
<Om> Ninjazz|Depressed: Yes, "whatever"
<CrazyCherry> Ninjazz|Depressed: I'm just teasing him...:)
<Kammerjunk> doughnutjoe: Magic.
*Kammerjunk snortsnort.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Inb4 YouTube becomes too mainstream and almost everyone switches to Nico Nico Douga. :P
<doughnutjoe> but they aint unicorns...
<Kammerjunk> YouTube -is- too mainstream. Google Videos is where it's at.
<BlueFlare> 02Ascendant knows everything
<Ninjazz|Depressed> CrazyCherry: You like to see him squirm, don't you? :$

<CrazyCherry> Kammerjunk: You made Youtube Look bad.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Oh, you know deep down that they really do love you somewher in their toying ways.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> doughnutjoe: And why is that? :S
<Kammerjunk> At first, that voice made me think of Miracle of Sound for some reason.
*CrazyCherry hugs Kammerjunk.
<doughnutjoe> Ninjazz i don't know she works and does some mental health shit
<Ascendant> ?
<Twi_Fi> Seems legit.
*Kammerjunk hugs CrazyCherry back.
<Ascendant> Hey
<Ninjazz|Depressed> doughnutjoe: I don't think I'm on that level, yet. -_-
<Ascendant> I don't mind windows /that/ much
<Ascendant> I just prefer linux
<CrazyCherry> Twi_Fi: I know.
<Om> Ninjazz|Depressed: I sure hope not, then they have more emotional compultion to do it further...
<doughnutjoe> she tells me she works with "Depressed people" or something
<drf-Droid> that's what I mean
<drf-Droid> but anyway
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Om: Well, there has to be a reason... Right.
<doughnutjoe> If you go you get a free stress ball :$
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: That could be any work environment.
*CrazyCherry nuzzles Ninjazz|Depressed so he wouldn't be depressed anymore.
<doughnutjoe> but the stress ball....
<Ninjazz|Depressed> As tempted as I am to remove |Depressed from my name, I sadly can't. That would be lying. :(
<Kammerjunk> I have a pair of stress balls that you twist around each other in your hand. It's relaxing as hay.
<Twi_Fi> hay
<Om> Ninjazz|Depressed: I'm sure they have their reasons... And now you have me thinking about what is worse...
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<Ascendant> lolwut?
<Ascendant> I use windows
<Ascendant> for gaming
<doughnutjoe> what have i done...
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Om: What is worse?...

<Om> Ninjazz|Depressed: Give me an hour and I may come to a thesis.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Thank you anyway, CrazyCherry. I do apprecaite the help though. :)

<GilDash|BLT> Ninjazz|Depressed: Hush now, quiet now, it's time to go to bed. :)
<Airpuff> Ninjazz|Depressed: Might you enjoy Sweetie Belle's version better? xD

<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|Depressed: Go to bread.
<Lil_B> hi everyone... man I'm tired D:
<Om> Ninjazz|Depressed: Is that suppriseing?
<Kammerjunk> Ave, Lil_B.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: go to bed? o.o
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Om: Just a tad.
<Twi_Fi> yaplap's version would be best.
<Twi_Fi> And hello Lil_B.
<Om> Ninjazz|Depressed: Fine then, stay up and rot your brain
<Lil_B> Airpuff no, or i can't sleep at night XD
<Airpuff> Lil_B: ooh its the middle of the day? >.<
<Giger4444> Staying up is not good for you. Ive done it many times and I spent half year being miserable.
<Lil_B> Airpuff yes, i just came back from School XD, its 4pm here
<Kammerjunk> Ditto.
<Kammerjunk> I'm tired anyway.
<drf-Droid> >English teacher from last semester using an iPad in student lounge
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Dammit, GilDash|BLT. Look at what you've made the chat become.
<Airpuff> Giger4444: no way, i've been sleeping 4 hours a night for half a year and i feel great! xD
<GilDash|BLT> Ninjazz|Depressed: Go to bed, go to bed, go to bed! Go to bed, go to bed, go to beeeeeeeed!
<Om> Its 7am here woOOoooOO
*Ninjazz|Depressed sighs
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Very well.
<GilDash|BLT> Ninjazz|Depressed: Good. :)
<Airpuff> Ninjazz|Depressed: its up to you xD
<Kammerjunk> Actually, it is possible to go with sleeping 20 minutes every 4 hours, but it's not a good idea.
<GilDash|BLT> Ninjazz|Depressed: It's not like we're going to disappear. :D
<teh_Tharassan> ...
<teh_Tharassan> says u
<GilDash|BLT> Kammerjunk: I know, and it's 15 minutes.
<Om> I might.
<Airpuff> Ninjazz|Depressed: you can change your nick to stay up further ;)
<Airpuff> xD
<Giger4444> Airpuff: yet... :) Last semester there were many occasions when I slept about 12 hours per week, many times I've been up for 2-2 and a half days straight
<Kammerjunk> Close enough.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Eh.
<Airpuff> Giger4444: same here xD
<Giger4444> Airpuff: This semester my productivity just flatlined
<Ninjazz|Depressed> My bed is looking really comfy all the sudden.
<Lil_B> Kammerjuk its also possible to just sleep between 4-5 hours a day... but nobody will make me do it
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I guess it won't hurt.
<Airpuff> Giger4444: not mine =S Guess thats the diffrence xD
<GilDash|BLT> Why is no one sleeping and then complaing about how crap they feel? :D
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: The thing is that you don't go into REM instantly.
<Giger4444> Airpuff: I envy you :D
<Airpuff> Giger4444: all my friends say the same xD
<teh_Tharassan> *gives Ninjazz|Depressed a fluttershy to sing him to sleep*
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Can I keep her?
<twilight_sprinkler> my douchebag roommmates prevent me from sleeping
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Anyways.
<Airpuff> Gives Ninjazz|Depressed a cup of black coffee.. xD
<Om> I slept good, and I'll do it again
<Ninjazz|Depressed> You win, GilDash|BLT.
<teh_Tharassan> Ninjazz|Depressed: HELL NO!
<Dken2021> Ninjazz|Depressed, how long have you been up for?
<drf-Droid> LOL, Skydroid, apparently Bill Nye will be visiting Ohio State University tonight
<twilight_sprinkler> last night one of those idiots was watching a movie and eating popcorn from a loud bag last night
*GilDash|BLT hugs Ninjazz|Depressed.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Dken2021: Almost 48hrs.
<GilDash|BLT> Ninjazz|Depressed: Night night. :)
<twilight_sprinkler> in the bedroom
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Night.
*Airpuff hugs Ninjazz|Depressed Good night then ^^
<Giger4444> twilight_sprinkler: you live in a dorm?
<teh_Tharassan> night man
<Dken2021> good lord man, get some rest
<Twi_Fi> twilight_sprinkler: :D
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, Ninjazz|Depressed.
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkler: That's why you need to get back at them.
<twilight_sprinkler> Giger4444: yep
<Dken2021> nighty Ninjazz|Depressed, hope you feel better soon
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkler: Put HCl in their food.
<Lil_B> Did all of ou made a Competition about staying awake?
<twilight_sprinkler> Kammerjunk: theyre assholes, we dont talk to each other at all, its not a friendly atmosphere
<Om> Stop talking to Ninjazz, or he wont leave!
<Twi_Fi> Goodnight Ninjazz|Depressed, may you no longer be depressed.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: i guess its a natural instinct xD
<Giger4444> twilight_sprinkler: that sucks. I couldnt live like that. After a while decided to get a job and rent an apartment :)
<Wrek> 05wait
<twilight_sprinkler> Kammerjunk: and its not that theres hate as far as i can tell, just very self-absorbed people
<Wrek> 05here's a song that will make this image worse
<DaringDude> this song is weasome
<Airpuff> ... as ong?
<Airpuff> a song*
<GilDash|BLT> I've done 48 hours before. I was convinced everything was moving out of the corners of my eye. :D
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkler: Well, put HCl in their food anyway.
<DaringDude> the pretender remix
<Airpuff> Lol GilDash|BLT xDD
<DaringDude> awww
<twilight_sprinkler> Kammerjunk: lol
<teh_Tharassan> ...
<Giger4444> GilDash: for me it felt like I was tipsy. Euphoric as hell.
<twilight_sprinkler> Kammerjunk: whatll that do
<Lil_B> Airpuff i just find it strange that it doesn't matter when i go on, there are always the same people on XD ike they NEVER sleep XD
<Dken2021> I think the logest I stayed up was 28 hours
<Dken2021> *longest
<Om> I can sleep in almost any position, so I havent ever stayed up longer than 25 hours.
<GilDash|BLT> Apparently this is my theme song here. :D
<Airpuff> Lil_B: xDD Ofc.
<twilight_sprinkler> Giger4444: i wont be living in a dorm next term either, this term i had no choice, its the rules
<DaringDude> Om awww
<DaringDude> Omm lucky u
<GilDash|BLT> Giger4444: I wanted to kill everything that talked to me. :)
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkler: Ooh! Or I know! Get two vials and fill one with HCl and the other with ammonia. Then put the two vials over a door and when they open, the vials will crash to the ground and mixm, creating a toxic gas.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: I sleep a regurarly 4 hours a week on normal weekdays and like 6 hours in the weekends xD
<Dken2021> twilight_sprinkler ah, freshman?
<twilight_sprinkler> Dken2021: yeah
<Kammerjunk> mix*
<Dken2021> I hate freshman rules
<DaringDude> Airpudd :D nice i got 5 hours last night
*Dermathil yawns
<twilight_sprinkler> Kammerjunk: lol dem chemical weapons. makes me wish i knew chemistry :P
<Om> DaringDude: Aye, slept though minor earthquakes, fire alarms and rock bands alike
<Litwick> I got 6.
<Lil_B> Airpuffs ~5in the week ~8-10at weekends XD
<Airpuff> DaringDude: thats alot o.o
<GilDash|BLT> This song is not helping my feelings for Spitfire over there. =_=
<Dken2021> they try to make you more social with everyone, even if you don't want to
<Nerom> Good afternoon everypony
<Dken2021> hai Nerom
<Dermathil> eh. I managed to sleep my full 8 hours on weekdays due to sleeping early.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: i hate when i forget the time though.. and i get like 2 and a half hour of sleep. xD
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkler: They're not even that hard to get. HCl is a swimming-pool chemical and ammonia, you can probably get in a grocery store.
<GilDash|BLT> Nerom: Holla! :)
<DaringDude> lol Om yeah i am a pretty heavy sleeper as well im sleep like a log at times
<Twi_Fi> Hello Nerom.
<twilight_sprinkler> Dken2021: not the freshmen i live with, minus one of them. and i dont like to be social either
<Sylandest> morning, everypony!
<Phase4> >this song
<OtakuTom> So yea, I'm just listening to the stream...what in the world are we listening to now? ^^;
<Phase4> >on a my little pony fan site
<Phase4> seems logical
<Twi_Fi> Hello Sylandest.
<twilight_sprinkler> Dken2021: that one minus however is extremely in social in our room tho
<Sylandest> morning, Twi_Fi! :)
*DaringDude glomps Phase-4 no good reason
<Giger4444> thats not very effective, it wold produce mostly ammonium-chloride
<Dken2021> morning Sylandest
<Lil_B> Airpuff my plan for the next holiday seoson: Stay up 1 hour longer than the previous day untill you reach the original sleep time XD
*Phase4 hugs DaringDude back
<Sylandest> morning, Dken2021! :) how are you today?
<DaringDude> :)
<Airpuff> Lil_B: xD
<Giger4444> not to mention that you would need about -20°C to liquidify ammonia
<Om> The chat is picking up.
<Dken2021> alright Sylandest, and you?
<Airpuff> Lil_B: I think ima ... I'll try get some more sleep as i move out.. but not before i move out.. it feels like im loosing so much time when i do xD
<Airpuff> Wrek: Okei... Band name and song Now pleaaase?! xD
<GilDash|BLT> Now you've all mesured up with your sleepign hours, how many of you have done it *without* caffeine? :)
<Sylandest> Dken2021: good, letting my laptop download World of Warcraft at the moment
<Litwick> suit tries?
<Kammerjunk> Giger4444: Doesn't it freeze at -77.7 C?
<Sylandest> GilDash|BLT: only a few hours a best, lol
<Om> GilDash|BLT: I don't drink caffine.
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, I made a mistake when I said "liquid".
<Lil_B> I don't drink Coffee and rarely Cola
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Me i dont drink coffee that much raelly xD
<DaringDude> me neither
<GilDash|BLT> Energy drinks count guys! :D
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Tea is the ultimate... coffee.... xD
<Giger4444> Yes, but it stays in gaseous form till -20
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: No energydrink either.. =s
<DaringDude> never had an energy drink...
<Kammerjunk> Right-o.
<Lil_B> I'm crazy, I don't do Drugs i don't drink Alkohol, I don't Smoke I don't drink Coffee...
<GilDash|BLT> I seriously know someone who was convinced that energy drinks had no caffeine in them until I pointed it out. =_(\
<Om> -_-
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: xD
<Dken2021> wat
<teh_Tharassan> this chat needs more ponies http://mlfw.info/f/1535/
<Giger4444> he mustve thought it was homeopathic :D
<DaringDude> Lil_B: me neither if u dont count as trying any of those as actually doing them
<Om> Energy drinks have about 4 different types of caffine
<Giger4444> and sugar. thats the other kicker.
<GilDash|BLT> ~Ariels in the sky / When you you lose small mind you free out lives~
<drf-Droid> >hot girl walks up and sits next to me on couch
<GilDash|BLT> And tourine. :D

<drf-Droid> :<
<Giger4444> I hate energy drinks
<Giger4444> latte or tea for me
<GilDash|BLT> Meh, they taste like crap. Good for Jagerbombs though. :D
<Om> Anything with an "ene" sound at the end, is a type of caffine.

<Twi_Fi> Hello Malavolent.
<DaringDude> i feel like i get so much better at drawing watchin this streams sometimes
<Airpuff> Sylandest: i hope youre not one of the ones who put like 5 spoons of sugar in the tea and still call it tea... xD
<Espeon> <Lighty> >Teacher gives me a 9 for a ICT thing i used a DA thing for <- a 9? what is the system like there, just from curiosity
<Twi_Fi> I hate doing this, but I must, goodnight everypony!
<Lighty> 0610 = 100%
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: No, that's me. And who uses spoons anyhow; tip it in from the container! :D
<Dermathil> ROAR
<Giger4444> Am I the only one who dont put ANY sugar/sweetener in tea/coffee?
<OtakuTom> Monster Rehab. It's a non-carbonated energy drink made from tea and lemonade. It doesn't taste like an energy drink, and on top of that it's only 20 calories for a whole can.
<Lighty> 061 = 10%
<Lighty> 061 is lowest 030
<Espeon> oh ok
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Omg ._.
<Dermathil> I'll be back in 5-10 minutes
<Kammerjunk> Well, I have to leave in 10 minutes, so I need to get ready.
<BlueFlare> 02oh
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Talk about ruining a good cup of tea -.-
<Espeon> like our system just we are 1-6, 6 being the highest x3
<Malavolent> OtakuTom: A healthy energy drink? I don't believe it.
<Lil_B> The Problem is that I'm currently in an apprentenceship in chemestry, but In germany... i would so like to explain some things right now, but my vocabulary is so limited in the technical part XD
<BlueFlare> 02then how is a 9 a bad thing?
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: What? There's only so much that tea can be saturated by at any time. :)
<BlueFlare> 02XD
*Airpuff glares at GilDash|BLT
<Lighty> 06it was DA/TST related
<DaringDude> there is a saturation limit
<Om> You drink sugar GilDash|BLT
<Lighty> 06teacher told it to class
<Airpuff> Yeah Om, GilDash|BLT just put sugar in hot water xD
<DaringDude> i just love drinking straight sugar
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: My physics teacher said so, and he's fucking awesome, so fuck you. :p
<BlueFlare> 02oh
<Espeon> ohdear
<Giger4444> Lil_B: same here. Though reading a few international articles and wikipedia helps :)
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Idc then your physics teacher is dumb! xD
<Sylandest> Airpuff: I tried that once...
<Om> Airpuff: I don't like agreeing with you on things >.>
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: For the record, I don't drink tea anyway. :)
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: Well, he *is* crazy, but the best are. :)
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: just say so ._.
<OtakuTom> I wouldn't neccessarily say it's 'healthy', since it still has all the same things that normal energy drinks have (taurine, caffeine, etc), but in terms of calories, it's way healthier than the others, and it doesn't taste like crap like the zero-calorie diet energy drinks.
<Malavolent> Guys, you would really drink sugar in water?
<teh_Tharassan> im going to play sum Tribes ascend later ponys
<Airpuff> Wrek: ... Band name!!!:'(

<GilDash|BLT> I am going to find images with a smile on my face before I loose it. :)
<Lil_B> Malavolent yes, but not much
<GilDash|BLT> I am going to ignore that spelling mistake too. :)
<Om> GilDash|BLT: Stop being confuseing.
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: say wuut? xD
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Well, then I need to drink gallons of water :D
<Airpuff> Om I think GilDash|BLT Loves Discombobulating ya xD
<Malavolent> And if I survive that (and I probably won't), I'll be skinny!
<TrixieMuffin> If you eat lots of icecream your body will burn fat to heat it up too.
<Sylandest> Malavolent: be careful not to do too much at once
<GilDash|BLT> Here. Fruit squash: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(drink) :)
<Giger4444> I think there is too much broscience here now :)
<GilDash|BLT> Honestly. :D
<Lil_B> Malavolent IF YOU WANT TO BURN CALORINES LIKE THAT IT#S MORE EFFECTIVE TO HUG AN ICEBLOCK
<Sylandest> TrixieMuffin: I can't eat ice cream...:(
<Om> Airpuff: I noticed, your no better in my opinion
<Lil_B> Malavolent sorry for caps
<Airpuff> Om: I never claimed that ;)
<GilDash|BLT> Malavolent: Or you could walk an hour a day. That's good exercise. :)
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Oh my god... Roadtrip to Antarctica?
<Om> GilDash|BLT: I blame it on america for my lack of knowlage
<Malavolent> GilDash|BLT: I'Ve walked 3 hours or so today, don't worry. :)
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: ... Physical movement?.. EEEW xD
<Giger4444> Walking is good indeed. I tried running but my knee cant stand it...
<Airpuff> I prefer sitting.
<Airpuff> But walking works..
<Airpuff> xD
<Lil_B> GilDash|BLT Blasphemy. Muscles is only more weight on your body
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: Hey, for my old job I used to walk 5 miles everyday. :)
<Airpuff> Lil_B: You cant say that, depends wether or not you are fat. xD
<Malavolent> GilDash|BLT: That must be unpleasant in hot temperatures.
<Sylandest> Airpuff: oh come now, its not so bad...*looks to see he has to go to kitchen to get a drink* ...I won't make it...
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: 2.5 miles of a 13 mile journey, then back again. :D
<Airpuff> Shesh GilDash|BLT ..
<GilDash|BLT> Malavolent: It's unpleasant in cold temperatures. I get abnormally warm from exercise. :(
<Airpuff> Sylandest: Wat? xD
<Sylandest> Airpuff: I was making a joke about physical movement and being lazy...lol
<Airpuff> Sylandest: sorry to lazy to understand it xD
<Malavolent> GilDash|BLT: Following that logic, it must be worse in summer, isn't that correct?
<Sylandest> Airpuff: I rest my case :D lol
<Airpuff> Ahaha
<Litwick> My internet froze with TLT's remix of the Smile Song. No complaints there.
<Giger4444> bachelor lifestyle rules: if its out of reach it could be at the other side of the earth as well.
<GilDash|BLT> Malavolent: Yes. And today the temperature is over 10 C. Which means I struggle. :D
<Airpuff> Litwick: seems legit
<Sylandest> Giger4444: good rule to live by
<Om> There's blood on my hand, I wonder how that got there...
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: xD You use a bike i hopee?
<Malavolent> GilDash|BLT: You're not from US, are you?
<Sylandest> Om: :O
<TrixieMuffin> I tryed not eating . Went 5 days on water alone , then i got bored , didnt exercise or anything though!
<GilDash|BLT> If I am not moving in a room I want no more than 18 C. If I am moving, fridge temperaturs please. :)
<RustyMeat> >got bored
<Wrek> 05this sogn is so random
<Lil_B> Om lick it. It may be ketchup
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: xDDD
<Sylandest> GilDash|BLT: so following that, does that mean you like the winter?
<Om> Lil_B: Its not.
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: No. I walk the whole thing. Bikes are too much of a hassle.
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: .. seriously.. bikes are to much of a hassle? xD
<Malavolent> Stream is a bit behind. it's actually funny :D
<Giger4444> GilDash then I presume you live in a large city?
<GilDash|BLT> Sylandest: Very much so. Snow makes it inconvenient to drive though. :(
<Om> Airpuff: Blasphomy!
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: I lived in Yorkshire. Everything was on a hill which meant STAIRS everywhere. :D
<GilDash|BLT> Back in a sec. ;)
<BlueFlare> 02!Pokemo
<BlueFlare> 02!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> BlueFlare, you are a 5Aggron.

<ScriptBot> BlueFlare, you are a 7Bonsly.
<BlueFlare> 02also
<BlueFlare> 02hai Espeon~
<Sylandest> Airpuff: I hate stairs..my entire college campus is a hill...lol
<Om> I like rideing bikes >_>
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: I mean.. avrage cycling speed compared to walking is redicolus.. its like 5-10 times faster.. xD
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Juuuust so ya know.
<Airpuff> x)
<TrixieMuffin> Winter , or rain , preferably at night , thats when i can stand to be outside . As long as i dont see too many people around , people just ruin it for me!
<Capn_Gavn> one of the unis im applying to is at the top of a massive hill
<Om> Unless you bike at 30mph downhill
<necroshadow123> lol im at school and using this epic win school didn't block it
<Airpuff> ... Wrek the fuck is this song? xD
<Lil_B> TrixieMuffin gun solves Problem
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: Irrelevant. I'm still waiting for trains too, and my walking speed is 5-7 miles an hour.
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Gun doesn't make it rain, silly.
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Still it is faster.. xD
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: 'Sides, why waste money on a bike when I can *run*? :D
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Beacuse its faster -.
<Lil_B> Malavolent depends on how big they are
<Om> Runing is hard.
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: Yeah, but I've got the times between two trains to wait for too. So it really doesn't matter at all.
<Malavolent> Lil_B: I like where this is going.
<GilDash|BLT> Om: Running is easy. :)
<Espeon> oo
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: I guess you're right if you're raking trains xD
<Om> GilDash|BLT: it hurts my soul!
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: FUCKING TRAINS! :D
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: "I LIKE TRAINS!"
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: They're NEVER on time. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: You should try the busses where i live..
<Malavolent> Damn, I wan't to ride train to my school, or everywhere else.
<Giger4444> And they are filthy and smelly
<GilDash|BLT> Om: It hurts my shoe soles, but that's about it. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Its like.. the first one doesent show up... neither does the second one.. and after 45 minutes three coems in a row?... the fuck..
<Om> GilDash|BLT: Heathen!
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: No, you should try the buses where I live now. :D
<Lil_B> Malavolent China had a problem with a giant Snowfall, because they tried to let the snow fall controlled by shooting the clouds... normaly that actually works and China isn't the only country doing that
<Giger4444> rammstein?
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: Same. Only we're on a half hour schedule, so miss one and you've waited an hour. -_-
<Airpuff> Giger4444: nope this is either nowegian or sweedish
<Malavolent> Lil_B: They shoot the clouds and the snow begins to fall? How does that even work?
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: xD
<TrixieMuffin> Id like to have an umbrella that makes it start to rain whenever i open it! speaking of wich , i still havent gotten myself an Umbrella Corp. umbrella, and i want one !
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: And they are always Stuffed with people too i guess? -.-
<Om> This sounds like someone is screaming the final countdown
<Airpuff> Om its a sweedish metal band for what i understand.. of what they are.. "singing" xD
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: The last time I was on one there was some fat guy who smelt of death. I considered just hopping off and waiting for the next one. :D
<Lil_B> Malavolent they also can do it with rain, so it doesn't grow into a giant storm. I don't know... they just kinda activate them i think :/
<Om> Airpuff: Ah.
<Giger4444> This sounds like a guy who is trying to pass a kidney stone.
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Know that feel >.>
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Damn Chinese, cheating mother nature.
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: There's alwaus this woman with her walker.. and she starts crying each time she gets on in fear of the bussdriver starting to drive before she has sat down -.-
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: FFS, right. :D
<Om> Let er fall!
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: thus it always takes like 5 minutes for her to get on ._.
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: ALWAYS!
<TrixieMuffin> You "seed" the clouds with small particles , so the watervapor can condense onto them and form droplets or snowflakes depending on temperature , thus controlling where and when it rains instead of having to wait for critical mass!
<Lil_B> Airpuff make some noises when she enters to let her think he hes about to drive XD
<Malavolent> Airpuff, GilDash|BLT: I'm glad I don't live wherever you two live.
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: We never had any regulars when I used it. There was always *one* of them anyway. :D
<Airpuff> Lil_B: Seriously man.. i dont wanna stay on that stuffed bus longer than i have too.. plus then i would have to call the ambulance -.-
<GilDash|BLT> Malavolent: Well, I live in Wiltshire, which is in England, which is nowhere near Airpuff I'm guessing as I'm fairly sure he's in America. :D
<Espeon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Espeon, you are a Tyrogue.
<Lil_B> Airpuff i can releate to that :/
<Espeon> !eonget
<ScriptBot> 4Espeon just got a male 6Espeon
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Well this damn woman ALWAYS gets on in rushour... xD
<Airpuff> Rush*
<Giger4444> Im off to cook some dinner. Bye all!
<VioletGreySha> DAT raubtier nice Wrek :D
<Espeon> cloning.mkv
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: America? No I live in Norway
<Om> Rushour are good movies
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: Well, that's still foreign. :D
*GilDash|BLT is not racist at all.
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: There's a reason i understand the sweedish lyrics of this song xD
<Airpuff> .. Somehow.. they dont make that much sense.. xD
<Om> Airpuff: It has lyrics?
<Malavolent> GilDash|BLT: Oh, poor you. There is always cold weather in England, isn't it?
<Airpuff> Om eeyup ... somehow -.-
<Om> Airpuff: I think you're lieing.
<Airpuff> Malavolent: Try norway xD
<Airpuff> Malavolent: colder here xD
<Malavolent> Airpuff: But you're vikings and stuff, a small winter can't be that much of a problem to you.
<Om> What is this one saying.
<Airpuff> Malavolent: It's alaways nice to exit the door in the morning in - 30 Celcius -.-
<GilDash|BLT> Malavolent: Well, not cold per se, we just complain about it more. :D
<Airpuff> Malavolent: well i guess.. i never close my jacket unless it is - 20 or lower
<GilDash|BLT> Malavolent: AS for me, I prefer sub-zero remperaturs apparently. :D
<Malavolent> GilDash|BLT: That actually makes sense.
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: I'd love to live somewhere as cold as that. :)
<Lil_B> Airpuff true Scandinavians Heat themselfes up on an ice block!
<Malavolent> Airpuff: I guess you get used to cold temperatures.
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: ... well its not that good xD
<Malavolent> From that viewpoint, mine country is the worst.
<BlueFlare> 02!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> BlueFlare, you are a 3Sceptile.
<Airpuff> Malavolent: Yeah i guess...
<BlueFlare> 02bbl
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: I can go in a storm at -14 C during gale force winds with a t-shirt and be fucking WARM. How does that work? :D
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Donno -.- same as me..
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: Soaked to the skin too. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Maybe not that bad.. xD
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Still -14 is normal here..
<Airpuff> At winter ofc.
*Magical_pablez94 dries his mane while he's coming out from the shower..."oh, Hello everypony! how's your day been?"
<Malavolent> Wrek: Why does Spitfire have that green sparkle in her eye?
*Lil_B mutes Stream, puts o some C64
<Airpuff> "me stares at Magical_pablez94 YOU ARE NUDE!
<Om> Coldest weather I was in was...In celcius would be eh...
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: Yeah, I'm mad. When I did kettlebelling in Yorkshire before I moved, during winter I would steam like a mofo. Like, you could *see* the steam pouring off of me.
<GilDash|BLT> Airpuff: Like a fucking kettle. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Hate that T.T
<Airpuff> GilDash|BLT: Happens to me when i take of my jacket xD Looks like a bloody superhero of sorts xD
*Magical_pablez94 "i know Airpuff ... hope i didn't shocked ya...:)"
<Airpuff> Magical_pablez94: Ofc i dont mind ;)
<Airpuff> xD
<Airpuff> .. Seriously.. these lyrics xD
<Wrek> 05fuckign wings
<Airpuff> Wrek: Tell me about it.. working on my RD .. its a fucking pain xD
<Om> In celcius the coldest weather I have been in would be I think -70ish
<Malavolent> They have deep meaning, don't they?
<Airpuff> -70.. what? xD
<Airpuff> celcius?....
<Airpuff> Malavolent: super deep...
<Airpuff> xD
*Magical_pablez94 keeps dring his mane and sits down "uff..."
<Om> Well it was -46 degreese F
<Om> Simple math in the mornin hurts my head -_-
<Malavolent> Google is useful...
<Magical_pablez94> i love having showers...:)
<Lil_B> how was the Formula for F in C again ... i forgot
<GilDash|BLT> Magical_pablez94: Would you like me to towel you off? ;)
<Malavolent> I tried googling how many Celsius is -46 Farenheit.
<Om> Well 0 C is 32 F
<Malavolent> It is 229 Kelvin.
<Kid_Cobalt> Wrek: Hard to make detailed wings with ponies huh? When there bodies are generally supposed to be smooth.
<Phase4> interesting wings
<Sylandest> GilDash|BLT: and here I thought it was going to be a quiet morning...lol
<Airpuff> -43 Celcius Om xD
<GilDash|BLT> Malavolent: I can work with Kelvin. :)
<RustyMeat> Farenheits is a silly thing
<Phase4> Malavolent, good to know
<Om> Airpuff: Math is hard
<Phase4> 0 c is 273 k i think
<GilDash|BLT> Sylandest: Goddesses forbid it! :D
<Lil_B> -43 °C is more realistuic XD
<Airpuff> Yep.
<Sylandest> GilDash|BLT: haha! :D
<Phase4> celcius and kelvin are the same thing with different zeros
<Airpuff> Om: Depends, you do alot of assigments?
<GilDash|BLT> Phase4: I know. :)
*Magical_pablez94 raises his front hooves letting GilDash|BLT do what she wants to do
<Malavolent> 0 K is –273,15°C if I recall correctly.
<Airpuff> Om: if you work alot it gets easy.. somehow xD
<Lil_B> Phase4 273,15 but don't want to be nitpickly here
<Airpuff> Malavolent: seems right
*GilDash|BLT towels off Magical_pablez94, humming as she does so.
<Om> Airpuff: Oh yes SOMEHOW
<Airpuff> Om: don ask me.. im not good at maths anyways xD
<Phase4> Lil_B, :|
<Malavolent> Airpuff: I remember it begins at absolute zero temperature and goes up.
<Airpuff> Anywayss!! Dinner brb peeps xD
<GilDash|Laundry> I'mm be back in a sec. ;)

*Lil_B hugs Phase4 back
<Dermathil> Dohoho ninja cameo on stream!
<Malavolent> Oh stop it, you!
<Dermathil> mwahaha
*Om continues claping
<Malavolent> Om: You're embarrasing me :$
*Magical_pablez94 smiles at GilDash|Laundry humming
<Lil_B> "Skate.or.die...skate or die... skate or die.. die dddiediedie...
*Om debates if he should clap more
<Malavolent> Anyone else finds themselves turning heads as Wrek turns the picture?
<Sylandest> Be back soon, everypony, gonna step out to buy something I need
<Malavolent> Sadly, I can't turn my head 360 degrees.
<Om> No, that would be silly
<Wrek> 05hows that?
<Malavolent> I think the size is right.
<Lil_B> looks better then mine
<Wrek> 05color contra faic?
<Magical_pablez94> Airpuff: btw i'm a pony so i'm almost always naked :D
<Om> It looks really good. Oh and you moved the shadow good
<Kid_Cobalt> Wrek: I love yhe shading, the colors all seem perfect. But doesnt she have hilights going all the way through her tail?
<Om> Magical_pablez94: Yes you are.
<Magical_pablez94> Om: ok?
<Om> Magical_pablez94: Okay indeed.
<Om> I never know how to draw wings...
<GilDash|Laundry> I can't draw for shit. :D
<Malavolent> GilDash|Laundry: Neither can I, but I'm learning.
<Om> GilDash|Laundry: That is because shit don't need anything drawn for it
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: Well, I'm not doing that either. :p
<GilDash|EqD> Om: :|
*GilDash|EqD noogies Om.
*Om is unsure if noogie is better or worse than hug/glomps e_e
<Magical_pablez94> Om: it's incredible how pegasus wings are similar to human hands... just give a look at arts and u'll notice that.... five feathres attached to a rigid part...
*GilDash|EqD brushes Om's mane.
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: I'd like to draw something beatiful. Long way to go.
<GilDash|EqD> Om: Brushie, brushie, burishe... :)
<Magical_pablez94> Om: and the middle one is even the longest...
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I'd like to draw something that looks like something. :D
<Om> Magical_pablez94: I have disected a chickens wing befiore
<Lil_B> I'm staying in the chat, but I'm currently searching for some ZX Spectrum Art, to get all the colours
<Magical_pablez94> Om: *poker face* i eated one :D
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: Yeah, that's a good achievement too.
*Om curses brushies
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: :D
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I'd like to draw my OC. :D
<Wrek> 05the way i draw hair eliminates the highlights
<Kid_Cobalt> Wrek: hmmmm.....Then superb.
<Om> I only draw in pencil sooo...I cant do what wrek does anyway
<Lil_B> one does not simplo go to Deviantart without expecting Ponys in the "Recent Pictures" Part
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash|EqD: yeah me too... i'd like to have different hands so that they'll do what i say them...:D
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: I wonder why I don't have my OC yet.
<GilDash|EqD> Magical_pablez94: I'd like to have a different brain so I can think straight. :D
<Om> Malavolent: You and me both.
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I have an OC but no damned colour scheme. :D
<Malavolent> Om: I personally dislike OC ponies with really dark or crazy colors.
<Om> Malavolent: Huza! Someone else!
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: See, I like Luna and Thunderlane, and they're both darker ponies.
<Malavolent> Like really, every second one is a pony avatar of Satan.
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: Well Luna is princess of night, so it makes sense.
<Om> GilDash|EqD: Their colors are fit, and are still quite light colors.
<Malavolent> Bud almost all the other ponies are made in bright colors.
<Magical_pablez94> i tried to draw my OC thousands of times GilDash|EqD without one single success...
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: Yeah. I know what you mean though. I don't like pitch blacks and the like either. :D
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: Well, I'm glad I'm not the only one.
<GilDash|EqD> Magical_pablez94: Well, I'd just like to draw her so I can get my mind's eye on her... ;)
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: They just look so... wrong. :D
<Om> Malavolent: I agreed with you too...
<Phase4> this is me, 5.5 hours from when i need to wake from class, not going to bed
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash|EqD: :D
<Malavolent> Om: I know, sorry I didn't mention you :(
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: " Like they came out of this world. "
<Om> Malavolent: Tis kay, just yanking your chain
<crazypony> nice background Wrek
<Malavolent> Who gets the reference, kids?
<Phase4> my bad, 6.5 hours from class
<Phase4> either way
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash|EqD: my OC pony was pretty easy to do... i just used the pony generator....:D:D
<Om> Magical_pablez94: I felt so limited with the generator
<Dken2021> same here
<Dken2021> not enough hair styles
<Malavolent> I would make my OC pony from scratch, should I make one.
<Om> Aye
<Magical_pablez94> Om: yeah me too, expecially on da mane type, but i'm adaptable:D
<Om> Magical_pablez94: Fair enough.
<Malavolent> I'm fed up with OC's with recolered Fluttershy hair.
<Om> I would link some of my "art" but they would just look even worse next to wreks soo. That won't happen.
<Malavolent> Om: Link them anyway, it's not a competition.
<Om> Malavolent: Is always a competition.
<Phase4> how does applejack do her hair?
<Malavolent> I only wanted to make you feel better.
<Om> Phase4: Magic?
<GilDash|EqD> Om: Why do artists always hate their work? I'm a writer mind, so I'm of the same mind. :D
<Phase4> Om, earth pony : /
<Dken2021> earth pony magic of course
<Om> Malavolent: I apriciate that. But I be a pecimist.
<Om> Phase4: Yes she is. Earth pony magic
<Phase4> lol Dken2021
<teh_Tharassan> hello im back :)
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: Same here. I'm writing some story and while I think it could be better, my friend described it as "Epic".
<Dken2021> hai teh_Tharassan
<teh_Tharassan> is this german metal?
<Phase4> she's got hair ties in both her mane and tail, how does she do that
<Om> GilDash|EqD: That is because my stuff is actualy bad soooo
<Om> Phase4: Mayhaps big mac does her hair?
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: Goddesses do I get good ideas. The moment they're on paper or written down though... :D
<Litwick> Anyone find it wierd how Magmar is the SPITFIRE Pokemon?
<Phase4> Om, i cant imagine big mac working a hair tie
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: True dat.
<Dermathil> Hey Phase4
<Phase4> ohai Dermathil
<Om> Phase4: And that is why I propose the idea. Not likely, but possible.
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I think that's why I let myself come up with all these ideas, but never actually sit down and try to write them all out... I'd have a fuckign novel length book full of just ideas if I did that. :D
<Om> Litwick: Sexy Magmar?
<Dken2021> magmar has an odd shaped head
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: I don't really think about ideas, I just ride the bus and suddenly I get an idea how the story should continue. I don't bother writing it down too. :D
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I've got 8 years worth of ideas in this head spanning some 25+ works. Only half of them are fanfics. :D
<Dken2021> it's good to write your ideas down, that way you won't forget
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: You write a lot, don't you?
<GilDash|EqD> Dken2021: I can't write them down, that's my problem. :)
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: Not at all. :D
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: That, again, is the problem. I'm good *when* I write, but I don't. :D
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: You could be a fanous writer one day. If you weren't so lazy. :D
<Om> GilDash|EqD: I wish I had that problem.
<necroshadow123> should i be on here during class
<Om> necroshadow123: yes.
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I'm not sure if it's because I'm lazy... or scared. ;)
<ACS13123> so...HI :)
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: Scared of what?
<Dken2021> hai hai ACS13123
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: A lot of the ideas I have feel so big, that I don't know how to tackle them.
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: Hey, I've always wanted to write a Fantasy/Reality genre book. At least, I'm trying to do it.
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I keep feeling like they have to compare to the most well-known works in terms of quality and the like, despite having no real experience into the art. :D
<necroshadow123> lol ok Om
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: You've got to start somehow.
<Airpuff> Okei im back =O
<Dermathil> GilDash|EqD: I know that feel
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: If Twilight could get published, your story can be even better.
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I've got some 10 novel ideas in my head, a lot of them fleshed out. How I've managed to keep them distinct and seperate from each other over 8 years is weird. :D
*Om gumbles along with the music
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: Yeah, I guess so. :D
<Om> Airpuff: You left?
<Airpuff> Om Eeyup dinner
<Om> Airpuff: Didn't notice.
<Airpuff> Om Well gee thanks T.T
<GilDash|EqD> Om: Why on earth would you clamour for Airpuff. You're not feeling lonely, are you Ommy? ;)
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: I think about one long story, I guess it would be long as LotR, if I wrote it all down.
<Airpuff> GilDash|EqD: xD
<Om> GilDash|EqD: I can get lonely if I want to >.>
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I have several that length... -_-
<F22skyhunter> sup guys
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: Well, they'll all go to waste, if you won't use them somehow.
<Dken2021> hai F22skyhunter
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: You can just take a few ideas from other stories and then write a whole new one, where all the ideas will be in.
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: I know. It's frustrating. I need to find a way to just do it instead of worrying about it.
<necroshadow123> who else is scared about telling their freinds that your a brony/pegisister
<Malavolent> Somewhere I've read that comfort is the biggest enemy of mankind.
*Dken2021 raises hand
<Om> necroshadow123: No friends, so it was quite easy.
<GilDash|EqD> necroshadow123: Yeah, right here! :D

<GilDash|EqD> Wrek: Nice. ;)
<GilDash|EqD> Very nice. :D
<GilDash|EqD> Too nice! :$
<Om> I agree
<Malavolent> You've got a typo in description, just saying.
<GilDash|EqD> Confound these ponies, they drive me to... things... :$
<Dermathil|AFK> *Nicely
<Airpuff> GilDash|EqD: ..... those things.. xD
<Om> GilDash|EqD: Oh, sensor now eh?
<Malavolent> My inner Grammar Nazi is satisfied :

<GilDash|EqD> Airpuff: Yeah... things... :D

<Wrek> 05I cnt TYEP LOL
<Dermathil|AFK> BACK IN 5 MINUTES
<Malavolent> But I still wonder, why does Spitfire have a green sparkle in eye, does a green light shine at her?
<Om> GilDash|EqD: Threat agnowlaged.
<GilDash|EqD> Om: :)
<Wrek> 05you figure it out
<Om> Green with envy!
<Malavolent> Why envy?
<Malavolent> She is the last pony to be envy I think.
<GilDash|EqD> Malavolent: Obviously she knows she can't handle RD. ;)
<GilDash|EqD> Fortunately I'm always around. :D
<Malavolent> GilDash|EqD: IF you think so :D
*Om facehoof

<GilDash|EqD> Wrek: Symbolism isn't really my thing, until it is. :D
<EccoCode> Morning everyone.
<Malavolent> Don't tease me, I'm thinking!
<Om> GilDash|EqD: You don't say?
<Malavolent> But yeah, I guess changeling is the most probable option.
<GilDash|EqD> Om: You'd be surprised how much symbolism I try and throw into my stories. Problem: Unless I know of it beforehand, *I'll* miss it. :D
<Derpy_Ctrax> People, tell me good brony music :#

<Om> GilDash|EqD: Axidental symbolysm? Seems Lagit
<GilDash|EqD> Om: They're accidental until I realise them. Once I do realise them they usually cement or repel in my mind. It's a mindfield game. :D
<Malavolent> Whoa, that Fluttershy.
<Om> GilDash|EqD: Your games, they scare me.
<Sylandest> I'm back, everypony!
<FlareChaserxOctavia> I already saw the Spitfire photo, no need to link! :P
<Dken2021> hai Sylandest, again
<GilDash|EqD> Om: These are just the opening games. ;)
<Sylandest> howdy, Dken2021!
<Malavolent> Crap, I'm chatting here and I can't manage to do all the things I should do.
<Malavolent> I'm out, see ya later.
<Dken2021> seeya Malavolent
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: games? I like games!
<GilDash|EqD> Sylandest: Not my games. ;)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hello everybody
<GilDash|EqD> "Hold me / Thrill me / Kiss me / Kill me..."
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: oh, you mean those games...:$
<Dken2021> haai CrimsonPhoenix
<GilDash|EqD> Sylandest: Aye. ;)
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: well, do what you will. I've obtained the game disc I needed, so I'm happy with whatever happens, lol
<Om> Hence, why they scare me.
<Kid_Cobalt> Wrek: All in alll nice work. Will you be drawing more or is that all for today?
<GilDash|EqD> Sylandest: My games are physical, dear Sylandest. ;)
<Wrek> 05dunno
<Wrek> 05maybe
<Om> GilDash|EqD: You don't need to spell it out... More than you already have.
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: meep!
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Awesome :P
<FlareChaserxOctavia> I'm playing WoW right now :/
<Sylandest> FlareChaserxOctavia: I had to go purchase a new disc to play WoW
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Sylandest: ah, alright.
<Dken2021> oh cool diablo 3
<Om> FlareChaserxOctavia: You cant ship with Octavia, that is ilegal >.>
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Om: Who said I listened to the government? :|
<teh_Tharassan> lol
<Dken2021> octavia? but I thought you and colgate had a thing?
<Om> FlareChaserxOctavia: Who said that was the goverments law?
<GilDash|EqD> Om: But Octavia is some damn fine. ;)
<Litwick> Dken: He broke up with her.
<Om> Aye. She is.
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Om: who said I was going to listen to any laws?
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: so aside from the obvious, how are you today? lol
<Litwick> WHICH MEANS I CAN MAKE MY MO-I'm joking.
<Dken2021> well not sure how you break up with a cartoon pony, but whatevs
<Om> FlareChaserxOctavia: >_>
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Om: well, its true.
<GilDash|EqD> Sylandest: Same old, same old. ;)
<Wrek> 05wut
<Om> I take it lazers hurt.
<GilDash|EqD> Om: Lasers.
<Om> GilDash|EqD: That is what I said. Lazers
<Wrek> 05effing lazers
<GilDash|EqD> Om: Stop it with the z. It's wrong.
<FlareChaserxOctavia> LAZEERRRZ
<Dermathil|AFK> WREK BEAT ERROR 37!!!
<Dermathil> HE DID IT
<Dermathil> TROLOLO
<Om> GilDash|EqD: Something you don't like about lazers?
<Dermathil> And now for something completely different. HOLY HELL. 30 degrees celsius outside.
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: so by same old same old, you mean teasing everypony possible? lol
<Dermathil> Current exterior temperature of 86 farenheit.
<Dermathil> IN MAY.
<GilDash|EqD> Om: Laser stands for "Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation." There is no "Z". Stop it. :)
<Dermathil> THIS IS UNHEARD OF.
<Googer12> Hello.
<GilDash|EqD> Sylandest: Pretty much. I think I might have to do something to Om if he doesn't keep quiet.
<Dermathil> GilDash|EqD: The z comes from the way it is verbally spoken.
<Om> GilDash|EqD: But those arent Light, they made of deamon stuffs. So Lazers
<Googer12> Hiya everybody.
<GilDash|EqD> Dermathil: Laser is an acronym, not just a word.
<GilDash|EqD> Om: I will do things to you.
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: oh dear, what did Om do?
<Dermathil> GilDash|EqD It is still in the dictionary
<GilDash|EqD> Sylandest: Argue back. :D
<GilDash|EqD> Dermathil: Go and bring me this dictionary and prove it.
<Dken2021_> I think my cousin's internet hates me
<Om> GilDash|EqD: You cant hurt me I haz LaZers!
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
*GilDash|EqD sucks on Om's ear.
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: oh no, that never works...I remember too well, lol
<Dermathil> And besides, LANGUAGE EVOLVES. So Laser will eventually become Lazer.
<Dermathil> http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/laser
<Dermathil> THERE'S YOUR DICTIONARY
<Dermathil> MERRIAM-WEBSTER
*Dermathil gloats and laughs diabolically
<Om> Disreagard sucking aquire LAZZZZERS!
<GilDash|EqD> Dermathil: And nowhere on there is it spelt "lazer."
<Dermathil> SLANG
<Dermathil> LAZER IS SLANG
<GilDash|EqD> Sorry if I seem harsh on this, I was threatened with violence by the physics teachers. :D
<Dermathil> The language is NOT a static thing, but a living organism! It evolves and will eventually become lazer, its own word.
*GilDash|EqD licks the inside of Om's ear.
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: it's ok, it happens to all of us
<GilDash|EqD> Dermathil: Not if I can help it. :)
<Dermathil> The same evolutionary process that turned Thou into You
<Dermathil> You can't GilDash.
<Om> D-disreagard l-licking. And Keep! LAZER!
<Sylandest> Dermathil: I wouldn't underestimate GilDash|EqD
<Dermathil> Sylandest: You wouldn't underestimate ME.
<Sylandest> Dermathil: I haven't yet, lol. I never underestimate anypony
*GilDash|EqD kisses Om on the mouth to shut him up.
*Om turns head away "Lazer!"
<Dermathil> But you are. For I am not underestimating him. Lazer will eventually become a word on its own. Compare Ye Olde English and modern, international english. Or The many french dialects before Napoleon grouped them all together and said that the Parisian french was the only true french.
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: you're a persistent one, lol
<Dermathil> (Or a more modern example, Canadian french and European French.)
<GilDash|EqD> Om: There's only going to be so much lower that I can kiss. ;)
<Sylandest> Dermathil: in that case, I apologize. And you make a good argument there
<Dermathil> Language evolves constantly.
<GilDash|EqD> Dermathil: It does, but not Laser. :D
*Om ponders threat and weighs the pros and cons...."Lazers...are still better than lasers"
<Sylandest> Om: GilDash|EqD pounce incoming in 3...2...1...
*GilDash|EqD kisses Om slowly down the neck.
<GilDash|EqD> Sylandest: What good timing. :D
<Sylandest> GilDash|EqD: I have my moments, lol :D
<Dermathil> As of the present you are correct. But in the long term, one can realistically predict that the word will change with time into Lazer due to how often it is used by those who do not know the correct written form of the word.
<TrixieMuffin> as L.A.S.E.R. isnt just a name , but short for Light Amplified somethinorwhatever it will remain as is
*Om is now very silent
<GilDash|EqD> TrixieMuffin: Thank you. :)
<GilDash|EqD> Om: I thought so. :)
<Om> LAAAAAAaaaaazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzerrrrrrrr!
<Dermathil> Incorrect, TrixieMuffin. The acronym is the most used form of the expression, so in the dictionary it is considered a word in its own right. A word whose definition fits the full form of the acronym.
<Dermathil> Language is not a static construct. The rules of grammar get revisions every few years.
<Dermathil> Some words are removed from dictionaries and replaced by new ones.

<Sylandest1> I refuse to believe that anyone who is willing to try and draw something will fail. Art is art no matter what. GilDash|EqD, Lil_B, both of you have already succeeded because you have tried. You're better than me in that regard at least
<WallDives> pony_3241: rules. read them.

<Lil_B> I terms of Art I'm only cabiple of simple Pixel-Art (i can't even make a Desktop pony) and in terms of music I'm mostly Chiptune, but it mostly sounds..."OK for your first time"
<Lil_B> Can I post some samples and get Feedback?
<Lil_B> did my chat die?
<Sylandest1> GilDash|EqD: Have you sat down, with a pencil or pen or whatever have you, and drawn something, even remotely with shape or form? yes or no?
<WallDives> Well, if you try 0 times, you have a 0% success rate.
<Sylandest1> Lil_B: feel free to, i will provide feedback
<GilDash|EqD> Sylandest1: Once upon a time. I doubt I've improved since then. :D
