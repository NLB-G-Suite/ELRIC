<Phase4-> twilight calls her a unicorn
<Ingwaz> Wrek|Observing: probably right...i wish they had just left her a unicorn, it makes much more sense that way since we know not all royalty are alicorns because of blueblood
<Meanwhile> I don't recall Twilight calling her a unicorn, iirc she just reffered to her as a princess.
<Twi_Fi> Phase4-, yes, she does.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> WHERE DOES SHE CAME FROM
<Radu> Equestria
<Ingwaz> actually i think she does call her a unicorn
<Wrek|Observing> 05no fuckign allcaps.
<Phase4-> ^
<Twi_Fi> I remember Twilight refering to Cadence as a unicorn.
<Ingwaz> when cadance is using her magic to spread love in the flashback, i think she refers to her as a unicorn
<Phase4-> ^
<Phase4-> and another time iirc
<Ingwaz> however, alicorn is not an actual word, so its possible that alicorns are just called winged unicorns
<Meanwhile> Not really something I was paying attention to tbh
<Ingwaz> well, alicorn doesnt actually mean winged unicorn i mean
<Twi_Fi> True, an alicorn could just be a type of unicorn.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Yeah, noone seems to remember that alicorn is a fan term...
<alexxm> has the name alicorn actully been used on the show
<Meanwhile> Who knows, perhaps season 3 holds the answers to the infinite Alicorn questions.
<Ingwaz> alexxm: no
<dishwasher_EXTREME> I only know why they call the winged ponies pegasi
<Twi_Fi> Why was alicorn chosen, by the way?
<Phase4-> not sure
<Wrek|Observing> 05all-corn
<Spectrum_Rush> since no video link are allowed i will post this on why i think they Made Cadance an Alicorn http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/170875
<Ingwaz> Meanwhile: i think our best bet for universe information would be from the creators of the show, not the actual show
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Twi_Fi: because fans
<Wrek|Observing> 05its rather logical really
<Wrek|Observing> 05take unicorn.
<Wrek|Observing> 05remove uni
<Spectrum_Rush> read the comments in link to understand
<Wrek|Observing> 05add all
<dishwasher_EXTREME> pegasus
<Wrek|Observing> 05allcorn
<Meanwhile> Ingwaz: Implying there isn't some kind of connection there between the two?
<Wrek|Observing> 05replace the l with i for a smoother word
<Meanwhile> And because allcorn sounds like a pizza topping
<Twi_Fi> It seems too forced to me.
<Ingwaz> Meanwhile: i'm saying i doubt they'll bog down the show with pony lore to that extent when lets be honest, theyre still targetting the show at kids, not us
<Ingwaz> we just happen to love the show regardless
<Twi_Fi> It makes sense to think of alicorns as winged unicorns.
<Phase4-> the other name thats used is pegacorn
<Meanwhile> I dunno Ingwaz I'd say they leant more toward us in season 2.
<Phase4-> but imho thats a stupid name
<Twi_Fi> Yeah, pegacorn sounds worse to me.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> PEGICORN
<Twi_Fi> Hence, why I stick to alicorn despite my misgivings.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Lets call them magic
<Radu> Indeed, Meanwhile http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-bronies-change-everything.jpg
<Wrek|Observing> 05all-in-one-corn
<Airpuff> =O true
<dishwasher_EXTREME> the word pegasi come from the mythical horse 'pegasus' isn it?
<Radu> Mmm, corn
<Radu> Indeed^
<Phase4-> Radu: makes you think
<Airpuff> Yeah it does
<Phase4-> the image i meen
<Wrek|Observing> 05pegasi is the pegasus for many
<Ingwaz> Meanwhile: disagree, if they had, there would have been blatantly obvious fan nods everywher, not just somewhat hidden. i think theyre still just sticking with faust's ideal that shows for kids can actually have a story line and things that adults like
<Meanwhile> If they can just mention that Blueblood and everyone else of that kind of rank are just put there for the sake of politics and have no actual relation to the princesses I'll be happy.
<Wrek|Observing> 05its whats its called... prula?
<Wrek|Observing> 05prural*
<Ingwaz> plural
<Floris> Different kingdom.
<Meanwhile> Ingwaz: I'd say Derpy's entire existence is one big fan nod.
<Wrek|Observing> 05plural**
<Lasharus> Nice try Wrek|Observing. :P
<Airpuff> I agree Meanwhile x)
<Lasharus> Got there in the end though :P
<Radu> Oh my, I'm so glad Blueblood was forgotten
<dishwasher_EXTREME> pegasus is one of the most well known fact in acient greek mytholigy
<Ingwaz> Meanwhile: indeed it was, i'm not saying theyre not reaching out to us, just that theyre still making it with the kids in mind for the most part and us after that
<Wrek|Observing> 05another theory could be that theres a set of allinonecorns in each kingdom.
<Wrek|Observing> 05equestria being the capital kingdom
<Floris> I don't, since he did appear in a episode. :p
<Wrek|Observing> 05due to sun & moon control
<Lasharus> I think you're beginning to push the term 'alicorn' a bit Wrek.
<Lasharus> Could be me.
<Wrek|Observing> 05what gave that away?
<Commander_Shepard> Shepard is damn coward
<Ingwaz> Wrek|Observing: i think the problem most have with her being an alicorn is that alicorns, as far as we know, are immortal, which brings up issues since a unicorn and an alicorn are marrying
<Airpuff> =o
<Wrek|Observing> 05which once again makes its much more logical that candence originalyl was intended to be a unicorn
<Airpuff> Maybe she used magic?
<Floris> Yerp.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Cadence doesnt look to be immortal, since she was definately younger in the flashback
<Meanwhile> ^
<Lasharus> Truth.
<Wrek|Observing> 05immortal does not mean unkillable
<Ingwaz> Wrek|Observing: faust said herself that cadance was originally suppoed to be a unicorn
<Airpuff> We're not getting anywhere discussing this xD
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Id say its more logical to assume that only Luna and Celestia are the special immortal kind
<Lasharus> But it does mean unaging Wrek|Observing.
<alexxm> perhaps shes a particully young alicorn then
<Wrek|Observing> 05it just means that you wont die of natural casues
<Floris> Let's just say Alicorn's are very rare -The End.
<Lasharus> And Cadance has verifiably aged.
<Glitch|School> luna controls the moon, celestia controls the sun and cadance was left in charge of twilight /bad pun
<Meanwhile> She could be immortal, but she's also young.
<Lasharus> Oh for-
<Lasharus> Glitch|School, I may have to hit you for that :P
<Meanwhile> Where'd she come from?
<Ingwaz> indeed it does not, but it would be difficult to be married to someone who presumably will outlive you by a thousand years unless theyre murdered
<Wrek|Observing> 05one could argue that she will age and grow. but never die
<Airpuff> Ahaha, she's in charge of love if one is forced to pick something and set her as an Alicorn
<Wrek|Observing> 05which is the true meaning of immortal
<Glitch|School> Lasharus, come at me brony!
<Lasharus> Wouldn't that make Celestia and Luna... well, unaging then? Because otherwise they'd be kinda degenerate by this point. :P
<Ingwaz> usually immortals stop aging at some point though
<Lasharus> Point taken and noted Ingwaz.
<Kandarihu> Growing up and growing old are different things. In mortal life forms, the latter starts when the former is almost done. Not so with Alicorns.
*Lasharus slaps Glitch|School. You did ask for it.
<Airpuff> Well... Celestia is over 1000 years old.. isnt she? xD
<alexxm> at least Airpuff
<Airpuff> Luna too for that sake.
<Floris> If not older.
<Ingwaz> it could potentially be like the asari, but even their natural life span is only 1000 years, they do eventually die of natural causes
<Ryunosuke> Season 1 luna vs Season 2 luna :)
<Airpuff> Since she was trapped on the moon for 1000 years
<Radu> I'd say she is 2012 years old, tbh
<Meanwhile> We have no idea how old the royal sisters are, but damn old at least.
<Wrek|Observing> 05probably candence will grow to be large or simmilary large to luna & celestia. but that will take some time
*Glitch|School slaps back
<Lasharus> Ow.
<Floris> Season 2.
<Ryunosuke> I mean look at the difference :)
<Meanwhile> I forgot Luna was IN season 1.
<Ingwaz> Wrek|Observing: i hope not...it would cause me some concern if she was fully immortal
<Meanwhile> For about, 40 collective seconds.
<Kandarihu> Well, Luna never grew to Celestia's stature.
<alexxm> season 2 luna has more of a personality is season 2
<Lasharus> That's because you're silly Meanwhile.
<Meanwhile> :3
<Twi_Fi> I want another Luna episode.
<Wrek|Observing> 05meh, candence was a fluke that grew wings. she wont become older than any other unicorn.
<Wrek|Observing> 05a freak of nature
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I like Luna and Celestia being special, and alicorns other than them just rare
<Wrek|Observing> 05due to inbreeding
<Lasharus> Let's go with that Wrek|Observing.
<Lasharus> Cadance is a mutant. Moving on.
<Airpuff> It was so epic in season two.. dont remember the name of the episode.. "The voice of the royalties xD
<Kandarihu> Royal Canterlot Voice
<Lasharus> Uhoh.
<alexxm> canterlot voice
<Airpuff> xDD
<Ryunosuke> Luna Eclipsed
<Randomnerd> EXTREME READING
<Airpuff> Loved that one ahaha
<Ryunosuke> and it was "the Royal Canterlot Voice" :)
<Lasharus> Wow, no actual all-caps.
<Lasharus> I am faintly astounded.
<Airpuff> True, remember now =O
<Lasharus> (3...)
<Lasharus> (2...)
<Lasharus> (1...)
<Derpy_at_work> http://i164.photobucket.com/albums/u7/Phantomdarklover/30minutechallenge.png dat ladycanary
<Radu> Ponies
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Power reading
<Kandarihu> Oh, you're right, Lasharus. It's THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!!!!!
<Airpuff> Cute =o
<Lasharus> There we go Kandarihu, thank you.
<Spectrum_Rush> Cadance was Twi's foalsitter, Twi remembers her as pretty much an awesome one. it was discovered a long while before the finale that Lauren Faust was a babysitter for a girl named Chrissy, she drew for Chrissy pictures of horses as seen in the video. Lauren remembers this, and i think the production crew decided to honor this heartwarming development by making Cadance an alicorn as a canon Fausticorn. http://www.ponibooru.org/po
<Wrek|Observing> 05hi Derpy_at_work
<Lasharus> Ye GODS Spectrum_Rush.
<Twi_Fi> I need to see Luna more before I can rank her on my list of awesome ponies.
<Wrek|Observing> 05you tried to reach me yesterday?
<Spectrum_Rush> sorry
<Derpy_at_work> hai
<Spectrum_Rush> but i needed to get my opinion out
<alexxm> hey Derpy_at_work hows your day been
<Lasharus> Quite all right :P
<Lasharus> I just didn't expect the sudden wall.
<Lasharus> Hey Shizuka.
<Wrek|Observing> 05Shizuka!
<Ingwaz> Spectrum: lauren was not reminded of her baby sitting time until well in to s2 i believe. by then the finale story would most liekly already have been in production
<Meanwhile> Well, let's just wait and see. Canon seems to have a way of bringing our theories down on our heads.
<Kandarihu> Derpy_at_work: that's one cute OC
<Twi_Fi> Apology not accepted, espicially with the 404 image.

<Randomnerd> Bye Ingwaz
<dentidiot> shepard is a one man army here
<Xanbreon> In conclusion, this essay sucks, just give me a fracking A or ill cut your balls off
<Airpuff> I dont get.. why dont they hit his head? xD
<dentidiot> cos
<Twi_Fi> Crap, it just hit me that there will be no new pony episode this weekend.
<dentidiot> aliens
<Randomnerd> Okay, why didn't anyone tell me there's an "insane" mix of "For the New Lunar Republic"? DX
<Meanwhile> Because they're videogame AI
<Ascendant> XD
<Meanwhile> A duuuuuuh
*Twi_Fi is sad.
<Xanbreon> A conclusion is a quick summery of your main points, and what you think your actual answer to the question asked is
<dentidiot> its ok we'll live
<alexxm> theres always reruns Twi_Fi
<Airpuff> Hahaha, its like.. I can see his helmt... SHOOT THE ITEM HES HIDING BEHIND x)
<dentidiot> we got movie night
<Randomnerd> Twi_Fi: Time to read fanfics!
<Radu> I know, but I still don't know if I should buy it or not. I mean, I'm afraid for the imperfections
<dentidiot> its wierd how the enimes dont go next to him!
<Glitch|School> here a t-shirt is $25 shipping cost another $25 plus taxes a 30% of the total
<Airpuff> I hope you guys have heard the Brony songs...?
<Xanbreon> As i have explained that emma is a biatch and that hanging with friends is for pussys, I conclude that emma is a <censored>
<CountDoofus> Which ones? there's so many
<Airpuff> I guess you have...
<dentidiot> eyup
<Radu> Like, the colours being sightly off
<Meanwhile> dentidiot: would you really run out of cover in an attempt to get next to the guy trying to shoot you?
<Airpuff> For example Discord..
<dentidiot> maybe
<Xanbreon> Im not even sure which word I got kicked for
<Xanbreon> :(
<dentidiot> yesh discord!
<Airpuff> Epic. Shit. Ftw.
<Airpuff> xD
<Meanwhile> Nuke to the face.
<Commander_Shepard> lol
<alexxm> yep
<Wrek|Observing> 05ima gona place an order on WLF. and see the total price.
<dentidiot> buy us some presents wrek
<Radu> It'll be around 40 bucks, Wrek
<dentidiot> pwease :)
<Ascendant> last word
<Xanbreon> Ah
<Xanbreon> Bugger
<Airpuff> Do it for the community! xD
<Radu> Since you're a few countries away from me
<Wrek|Observing> 05thing is i dont like any of them
<CountDoofus> I love listening to Discord Days, that Demon Days spoof
<Twi_Fi> There should be a lottery when movies and episodes are picked for movie night, where someponies can win prizes.
<dentidiot> woo
<alexxm> like what Twi_Fi
<dentidiot> is it country locked though?
<xles> I wish that transatlantic shipping wasn't so goddam expensive, especially from the US... Curse you WLF, why do you have to reside in the US?!
<Radu> Also, there's the promo code EQUESTRIA10 for a 10% discount
<Radu> on WLF
<xles> Radu: Good to know!
<Twi_Fi> alexxm: t-shirt, drawing, pony toy, candy, anything.
<Radu> But 10% on a $25 T shirt is only $2.5
<dentidiot> is it for any country twi_fi?
<Twi_Fi> alexxm, obviously nothing expensive.
<CountDoofus> Oh wow, Twilight Sparkle hats
<Airpuff> ... That IS 2.5$... Think of all the treasures you can buy *-*
<alexxm> wouldn't the candy be out of date if it has to be shipped to another country Twi_Fi
<dentidiot> two things from poundland xD
<Radu> I'm camping WLF, waiting for another 25% discount soon
<xles> I have guestimated that I need to spend at least 100 bucks US on merch in order for a WLF order to be worth it for me. To balance out the shipping expense that is. =/
<Twi_Fi> Yeah, I didn't think it through.
<Radu> xles, where do you live?
<xles> Radu: Soviet Sweden.
<Radu> Soviet Sweden?
<Airpuff> Lol Soviet sweeden.. xD
<Radu> Oh, Sweden
<dentidiot> sounds legit
<RX-78-SweetieBot> spiders.txt
<Twi_Fi> I want prizes though.....
<Airpuff> ... Sweedes...
<Radu> The shipping for T Shirts in Europe is about $15-$25
<Airpuff> Makin jokes of us norwegians! D=
<Wrek|Observing> 05tjenare xles.
<dentidiot> :O
<Twi_Fi> Shipping would make it impossible.
<xles> Wrek|Observing: Tjofläns!
<Spectrum_Rush> speaking of Sweden
<Wrek|Observing> 05norr eller söderöver?
<xles> Wrek|Observing: Haningetrakter, söder om Stockholm.
*Spectrum_Rush Swedish Spitfire~melts
<dentidiot> lol
<Wrek|Observing> 05you have my condolences.
<Wrek|Observing> 05norr om gävle FTW
<Meanwhile> I'd point out the English only rule if I were brave enough
<Twi_Fi> I should read My Little Dashie tomorrow.
<Airpuff> ... xD
<Radu> Good luck, Twi_Fi!c:
<Airpuff> ...
<Twi_Fi> I keep putting it off.
<Airpuff> Yeah. Best of luck
<Spectrum_Rush> Do It Filly
<Airpuff> It is brutal.
<dentidiot> remeber tissues
<Radu> Wrek, how much did the shipping cost?
<xles> Meanwhile: Yeah, it is a tad rude of us isn't it.
<Wrek|Observing> 05havent found one i like
<dentidiot> tell it to shut up
<xles> I want myself the fluttershy bag... Sooo baaaad.
<Radu> O, I thought you were just checking the shipping price
<Renard> utf-8 encoding in my irc client: check
<Ascendant> okay 1202 words
<Ascendant> finally done
<Ascendant> now to format the stupid thing
<Wrek|Observing> 05whats the point if i dont like any of them? no reason to buy then
<Radu> Perhaps there'll be one released soon
<xles> I think I'll acquire myself some funds to get all kinds of various merch from various places and ship it all via jetcarrier or something... We'll see.
*Xanbreon claps
<Espeon> 06Make the conclusion a "tl;dr: drugs are bad, m'kay" or something for bonus points.
<Meanwhile> Mr wizard! Get me the hell out of here!
<Espeon> 06Also hi

<Airpuff> Theres a cool sweater with Big mac on it xD
<dentidiot> er robot shepard?
<Airpuff> Ofc.. might not be on the page, you're on though
<Twi_Fi> hmmmm
<xles> I'm not really big on t-shirts myself... I use them as under shirts. Proper dress shirts ftw. But hoodies are ok.

<Xanbreon> Drugs are not bad! >;3
<CountDoofus> I really like that Trixie nouveau on WLF, but being the nit-picking prick won't allow me to buy it because "Powerful" in french is "Puissante" and not "Incroyable"

<Chezne> telling a smoker to give up smoking is like telling us to give up ponies
<Digitalis> it would be hard to break that habit
<BronyState> hi
<Digitalis> just ask my parents
<xles> I also need to acquire myself a steady source of income. Easier said than done unfortunately. =(
<Radu> Well, there are pills for giving up smoking
<Radu> Not sure if they actually have effect, though
<xles> Radu: There are pills for ponies too. The red one.
<Radu> xles: Oh, you
<xles> =D
<RAWRity> Well, for people who are looking to ween themselves off smoking. I'd suggest trying to use E-Cigarettes

<Wrek|Observing> 05yeh

<alexxm> whats the name of this pony Wrek|Observing

<Wrek|Observing> 05last resort will be karlshamn/krona
<DJ-PON3> Hey wrek nice music :)
<Radu> You can borrow some money from banks

<Wrek|Observing> 05its a policy i have
<DJ-PON3> Hi everypony!
<Wrek|Observing> 05never take loans i can guarantee i will survive

<Radu> Wrek, are you still working at that game thingy?
<Radu> With guns, zombies, etc.?
<Wrek|Observing> 05Filosofie kandidatexamen.
<Wrek|Observing> 05Huvudområde: Utveckling av digitala spel.
<Wrek|Observing> 05Bachelor of Science
<Wrek|Observing> 05Main field of study: Digital Game Development
<Wrek|Observing> 05to answer field of uni
<xles> Cool.
<Radu> Are you still working for that game company?
<Renard> Beware Wrek, though way ahead. Everyone wants to be in the games industry those days.
<Wrek|Observing> 05yes i do radu, but thats on my free time. and its royalty based. indie game is indie game yaknow.
<Radu> Oh, I see
<Rainbow--Dash> Hey Wrek|Observing I got paint sai :) now all i need is a windows pad so i can draw better than i currently can, currently my drawings look like the show I WANT MORE THAN THAT I can draw much better with pencil so im going to get a pad :)
<Rainbow--Dash> What type do you suggest?
<Wrek|Observing> 05introus 4.
<Wrek|Observing> 05its a gem
<Radu> I always get about $30 on my birthday, since I'm still a teenager
<xles> Wrek|Observing: I've heard rumors regarding the tips on the intous 4 pen being somehow crap compaired to the 3 pens. Wearing out faster and whatnot. Anything you can comment on?
<alexxm> hey Rainbow--Dash hows your day been
<Radu> xles: Dat interview
<Rainbow--Dash> oh just fine :)
<Wrek|Observing> 05the tips wear a bit faster
<Wrek|Observing> 05but since they are easely replaced
<Sundaysmile> Hey ponypeeps
<xles> Radu: Haha, I'm just curious. I'm looking into tablets myself, and hearing such rumors tend to make you wonder.
<Radu> Indeed.
<xles> Wrek|Observing: What's the price on the replacements?
<alexxm> hey Sundaysmile hows your day been
<Sundaysmile> super
<Sundaysmile> though I noticed a wierd thing with the chat
<Wrek|Observing> 05havent had to buy any since it came with 10 replacements
<Sundaysmile> it only works if I use popout
<Digitalis> the bamboo fun ones are a good starter tablet for those who haven't used one before, the price for it isn't that bad though
<Radu> Also, you can get a 10% discount on the T Shirt with the EQUESTRIA10 promo code, just saying. It's just about $3 economy, but any bit matters
<Wrek|Observing> 05and so far ive only worn down 1
<Digitalis> and replacement nibs and such isn't that much i believe also
<Wrek|Observing> 05Radu: i based with that one
<xles> Wrek|Observing: Oh. Well fair enough then. I shall worry about the issue no further. Thanks. =D
<Radu> Oh
<Rainbow--Dash> Wrek|Observing the introus does look good however do you know of any nice ones where you can see the screen because that could be a big problem for me...
<Wrek|Observing> 05Rainbow--Dash: you jsut gotta get used thats all
<Rainbow--Dash> ok then :P
<xles> It's not entirely unlike learning to work a computer mouse rather than a light pen. ....Somewhat antiquated analogy perhaps, but valid, i think.

<xles> RAWRity: Or a type writer.
<RainBowJack> i have to go everypony
<RainBowJack> bye for now
<xles> Bai RainBowJack.
<RAWRity> Oh lord, with the way I type, I shudder to think how I'd do with a typewriter.
<alexxm> cya RainBowJack
<xles> oh
<Shizuka> 13hey folks, just want to let you know we've deployed a fix for the chat embed refresh button
<xles> Wacom has released an intuos 5 series... When did this happen?
<PonyImp> is anyone else having problems with youtube? Like thumbnails taking FOREVER to load (they're black for like 30 seconds before they load) and the banner on the home page never loads
<Digitalis> it wasn't too long ago i believe xles
<alexxm> did the stream just go to a black screen for anyone else
<Digitalis> sadly I'll never afford it T_T
<PonyImp> Anyone? Youtube? Loading thumbnails properly?
<xles> Anyone have any experience with the 5? I think I have to go read some reviews, now I'm all curious. =O
<RainbowCupcakeBath>
<Rainbow--Dash> YAY FALLOUT :)
<RAWRity> dat duckface http://derpy.me/kSX-E
<Phase4-> dat new vegas
<Phase4-> Wrek: aquire a hat
<PonyImp> ....................Anyone at all... literally all you have to do is open a browser and go to youtube...
<Digitalis> ah god that intuos 5 looks so damn sexy... i must have one!
<xles> Oh and btw, Rainbow--Dash if you reeeaaally want a display in your graphics tablet, IIRC the wacom cintiq line has that. Don't quote me on that though.
<Phase4-> PonyImp: little slow but they worked
<Phase4-> try ctrl+f5
<PonyImp> They work eventually, but do they appear all black forever before they finally load?
<Phase4-> yeah
<Digitalis> Yeah xles its cintiq
<PonyImp> what about the ad banner, did it load for you?
<Phase4-> youtubes probably changed how they work
<Digitalis> but be warned they are expensive
*Phase4- has adblock
*Phase4- should have been in bed 5 hours ago
<MahBoi777> lol
<Onyxia> hi everypony
<PonyImp> How about logging in
<Rainbow--Dash> xles XD omg 1500 pounds
<MahBoi777> hi Onyxia
<PonyImp> It won't load the log in page, comes up with a cannot find page style error
<Phase4-> PonyImp: already logged in
*Tarku hugs Phase4-
<alexxm> hey Onyxia hows your day been
<Phase4-> give it a minute, they're probably updating the site right now
<xles> Rainbow--Dash: pfft, you can't even get half a decent zeiss cine prime for that.
<Rainbow--Dash> lol
*Phase4- hugs Tarku back
<PonyImp> This was happening last night too though
<Onyxia> alexxm: helped a friend with his homework and now im free kinda
<xles> Rainbow--Dash: Do I win the "most expensive hobby I can't afford to have" award now?
<PonyImp> Ya I click sign up and I get "Web page is not available"
<Phase4-> PonyImp: what browser are you using?
<Rainbow--Dash> im thinking im going to get a bamboo tablet for a little more than 50 pounds :)
<PonyImp> It happens in ALL of them
<PonyImp> chrome, firefox, internet explorer
<Phase4-> all of them being...
<Phase4-> ah

<Digitalis> hell yes

<Phase4-> sry, typo. http://accounts.google.com/
<pony_335403> yeah...Fallout
<Wrek|Observing> 05who else can kill roaming ferals from logn distance with a varmit rifle? :P

<PonyImp> "Web page is not available"
<flutter_spin> ...where is the name "Sumica" from?
<Rainbow--Dash> I HAZ THE ALIEN BLASTER :)
<pyrocatboy> Hello everyone.

<RankWinner> Hello people!
<DJ-PON3> lol
<alexxm> yea PonyImp
<PonyImp> takes forever to load or doesnt load at all, every other website is just fine
<Shizuka> 13there's a 90% chance the problem is on your end
<flutter_spin> google is broken, yeah
<alexxm> hey RanjWinner
<DJ-PON3> twilight :)
<RankWinner> What's the problem?
<PonyImp> how is it on my end if EVERY other website loads just fine?
<alexxm> hey RankWinner hows your day been
*RankWinner puts tech wiz hat on.
<PonyImp> this website loaded fine, tera's website loaded fine, every help website i've tried to find loads fine
<flutter_spin> google is back.
<RankWinner> Fine thanks, your alexxm?
<pony_335403> pwnd
<alexxm> good RankWinner got some producers for a propety show coming to have a meeting with my mum today
<RankWinner> PonyImp, have your tried pinging websites that don't load?
<RankWinner> Nice, good luck =D
<PonyImp> how do you do that
<RankWinner> Press the windows key and R
<RankWinner> Then type cmd and press enter
<Litwick> Im loving this music.
<RankWinner> In the cmd window that opens type in 'ping' followed by the url of the websites that won't load, followed by -t
<alexxm> hey Litwick hows your day been
<Litwick> It's 9 AM where I am Alex. I haven't gotten to my day yet.
<alexxm> right sorry Litwick
<pony_335403> again...again and again
<PonyImp> could not find http://accounts.google.com
<pony_335403> HEADSHOT
<RankWinner> Hmm... that's... odd
<PonyImp> there
<PonyImp> everyone try to go to that website
<Litwick> I'll have to mute this stream for a little while I catch up on a Nuzlocke run I've been rreading.
<PonyImp> tell me if it loads
<Commander_Shepard> who is streaming?
<RankWinner> Nope, doesn't seem to work
<RankWinner> Well
<PonyImp> HA it's not just me!!!
<PonyImp> >:D
<RankWinner> It's HTTPS and my internet is odd
<RankWinner> One second, need to take pvn/proxy off
<Krakass> FO:NV doesn't have bullet drop?
<RankWinner> I stand corrected, it does work.
<PonyImp> https://accounts.google.com/ManageAccount
<PonyImp> you can try that one too
<RankWinner> Still HTTPS
<RankWinner> Actually, that could be it
<PonyImp> doesn't work at all
<Lonlymare> You could try using your range finders,
<RankWinner> Try going on any secure websites (such as Amazon login or Yahoo)
<Lonlymare> the three lines below your crosshair scope
<xles> Neat review of the intuos 5 if anypony (such as Rainbow--Dash) is curious, even if they are a billion dollars or so: http://deligaris.deviantart.com/journal/Wacom-Intuos-5-Touch-M-Review-290143233
<Renard> I think every game needs Twilight in their HUD.
<RankWinner> Do any websites with https load?
<Lonlymare> use the bottom one.
<Lonlymare> it's for longest range
<PonyImp> amazon's login loads just fine
<PonyImp> and its https
<pony_335403> http://halotheme.deviantart.com/art/Cadance-and-Me-298290837
<Airpuff> Oo Fallout
<Airpuff> ... that song...
<Airpuff> Who's playing??
<RankWinner> PonyImp , type 'ping accounts.google.com -t' into comand prompt and press enter.
<Randomnerd> Going to the dentist to visit colgate.
<Randomnerd> Later!
<Lonlymare> Sumica: your not even hitting use your range the lines below the crosshair are for differint ranges i would recomend the second one. for this range.
<Airpuff> xD Gl x)
<PonyImp> request timed out
<Digitalis> Well it seems I got my boyfriend into ponies, Mission Accomplished on my part. I've fufilled my duty.
<Krakass> Enjoy your root canal Randomnerd
<Lonlymare> you bad bad bad sniper you!
<PonyImp> RankWinner: all requests are timing out
<Airpuff> I really... hate that song.. remember when i played Fallout.. it kept on playing... again... and again... and again.. >.>
<pony_2507> that texture bug
<RankWinner> PonyImp are you at home or on another network like a public WiFi place?
<PonyImp> home
<Airpuff> Cant hit it with the sniper... why not pull my pistol xD
<RankWinner> Back to basics then. Have you tried restarting/changing browser?
*RankWinner prays
<pony_2507> :D noob
*RankWinner prays PonyImp is not using IE.
<PonyImp> I told you i've tried ALL browsers on it
<Digitalis> ewww IE
*Digitalis gags
<PonyImp> IE/Chrome/Firefox (im using chrome now)
<Fool> ,
<Fool> hello
<RankWinner> Have you tried restarting your router?
<Airpuff> ... .... The browser.. whose name should not be mentioned..
<Dark92Enigma> I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!
<PonyImp> How do >_>
<RankWinner> First, what country/region are you in?
<PonyImp> US
<RankWinner> If your in the UK with BT I can help, if not then... er... search online for it
<Dark92Enigma> FINALLY, i'm done with my homework
<pony_2507> that aim
<Airpuff> Hes going to die xD
<Airpuff> Ah.. maybe not x)
<Dark92Enigma> How is it going, everypony?
<PonyImp> doesn't google have like.. a help phone #
<Lonlymare> If you can't aim don't play FPS XD
<Airpuff> Seriously.. headshots take one bar.. xDD
<Mr-Dismo> .... He's using bullet guns on reavers
<pony_335403> gain...and again...and again...thats the spirit
<Rodonies> Brought another non-brony to this irc :D
<RankWinner> See if there's a 'Restart' button on it (NOT RESET), if not and if searching gives you no decent answers just unplug the router, wait a few minutes and plug it back in
<Rodonies> Fool
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hoy Bronies
<Fool> yes?
<Lonlymare> use the shotgun at least >.>
<Airpuff> =O *clop clop clop* He killed it! =D
<Airpuff> After a while... -.-
<RankWinner> PonyImp it would be preferable to call your ISP and ask them if there are any problems in your area (doubtfull considering what you described) and if there is a specific way to restart your router.
<Dark92Enigma> DED
<Lonlymare> Vats it
<Airpuff> Fallout
<Airpuff> New vegas =O
<Lonlymare> Be all badass and melee it
<pyrocatboy> Lonlymare: He never uses VATS.
<Airpuff> Why dosent anyone stream something cooler.... like... like.. hm.. FUS RO DAH! Skyrim.
<Airpuff> Or somethin like that xD
<Lonlymare> because skyrim is a solo experiance.
<Airpuff> .. might be true..
<Airpuff> What about Amnesia then?
<Airpuff> ;P That would've been cool.
<RankWinner> Thera are four Simon's on right now...
<Lonlymare> not as fun to watch i find,
<PonyImp> I pretty much give up
<Airpuff> Hmpf.. might be true =s
<PonyImp> It just can't be me, it's only google and google related sites
<Airpuff> Lol.. four simaons xD
<PonyImp> every other part of the internet works
<Lonlymare> Anyother idea i need to shoot down?
<Airpuff> good nobody takes my name =O
<Lonlymare> :D
<RankWinner> It could be a setting getting messed up in your hosts file, although that would be next to impossible
<RankWinner> What Antivirus do you have?
<PonyImp> nod
<Airpuff> .... I mean.. Fallout is alright.. but this country music is killin me xD
<Meanwhile> Ooh. Fallout.
<twilight_sprinkle> the music seems fitting
<RankWinner> Hmm... firstly go to.. er...
*RankWinner scratches head.
<Lonlymare> turn off the sound play your own music
<RankWinner> One second
<Airpuff> It is.. but still dosent make it cool! xD
<PonyImp> If I had a connection problem, the entire internet would have issues, not just one site ran by the same servers/company
<Dark_Horst> Airpuff: that's the fallout trademark athmosphere. you should hear the radio in fallout 3. THAT'S a jam
<Meanwhile> Needs more rad scorps.
<Airpuff> ._. I hate the radio xD
<pyrocatboy> Airpuff: This is folk music, not country.
<pony_3654> PonyImp, have you tried using the google DNS servers in your router?
<pyrocatboy> 17
<Lonlymare> Sumica needs a real gun >.>
<Lonlymare> or a melee,
<Meanwhile> Sumica isn't streaming.
<Airpuff> >.> I thought it was.. .. country.. sounds.. like coutry-ish for me o.o
<RankWinner> PonyImp it is possible that certain Google related IP's/DNS' have been blocked
<Lonlymare> I thought Sumica used twilight sometimes
<PonyImp> blocked by who
<pyrocatboy> 18
<Meanwhile> Nah, Sumica uses fleur.
<Lonlymare> I said twi sometimes :L
<Krakass> And Meanwhile "uses" Trixie
<Dark_Horst> dude, how can you hate the radio? wzhat can possibly be more awesome than shooting raiders to bits while listening to butcher pete by roy brown?
<Meanwhile> Wrek uses read-a-book Twilight.
<RankWinner> Your firewall, ISP, Antivirus, the Hosts file
<Airpuff> xDD
<Lonlymare> oh this is wrek?
<pyrocatboy> Airpuff: This is pre-country. Back when it was good.
<RankWinner> Speaking of that go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
<RankWinner> Open the hosts file in a text editor and see if anything to do with google is on there
<Lonlymare> WREK GET A REAL GUN.
<Lonlymare> :)
<RankWinner> Or anything at all for that matter
<PonyImp> And why after over 4 years of having a pc would it just randomly block it
<Airpuff> Yeah yeah.. I'm not saying it's bad.. i judt dont like it T.T
<Wrek|Observing> 05there should be a set of graves here around...
<PonyImp> idk where host files are
<Lonlymare> Oh. the graves thing?
<Krakass> They're in the cemetary
<Lonlymare> Wrek|Observing: your going for the item in the graves?
<RankWinner> It should be in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
<pyrocatboy> Airpuff: I just wish there was some Johnny Cash.
<pony_3654> your ISP might have service blocked google for some reason. it could be some malware on your computer screwing with your host file. there could be any number of reasons
<Krakass> cemetery*
<Meanwhile> Dem frags
<Airpuff> Cash would've been deacent yeah.
<RankWinner> If you are using Windows 7, I'm not sure where it is on other OS'
<Lonlymare> :D I remember the item in the graves being very good Wrek|Observing i remember needing to climb up a hill then going down to find it
<Lonlymare> hope that hels
<Lonlymare> helps*
<PonyImp> yaaa there are about 3000 folders in the directory you linked
<Wrek|Observing> 05no need to help me
<RankWinner> Errrrr
<RankWinner> Wut
<PonyImp> in system 32
<twilight_sprinkle> dont be an AJ.
<Airpuff> Have you guys seen "Goodbye my friend" flash??
<PonyImp> there's a billion folders
<RankWinner> Oh
<pony_3654> just search for a file called hosts
<RankWinner> Go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
<pyrocatboy> Airpuff: Yeah, imagine having Ring of Fire playing while
<RankWinner> Just press d and look for it
<PonyImp> hosts
<Krakass> FYI the graves are in the ground.
<Airpuff> x) Epic
<Airpuff> Btw Pyro, how do you link peoples names? =S
<Krakass> You type their name Airpuff
<Meanwhile> Krakass: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/243/964/2c6.png
<LightTrooper105> im back
<Lonlymare> type part of their name then tab
<Airpuff> pyrocatboy really?
<Airpuff> lol
<PonyImp> i have the hosts file open
<RankWinner> What does it show?
<Airpuff> Didnt work i think
<PonyImp> "# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.#"
<LightTrooper105> I see Twi on the screen and FO:NV so I assume Wrek is playing
<pyrocatboy> I just type in the name and use :
<pony_3654> there shouldn't be too much in that file on a home computer
<RankWinner> Is there anything after that?
<Airpuff> Ooo Okei xD
<PonyImp> "This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one# space."
<Airpuff> pyrocatboy: so now it worked maybe
<Airpuff> ._.
<PonyImp> then it shows examples
<pyrocatboy> Yes. Yes it did.
<Airpuff> Oh? It did? xD
<RankWinner> Are there any not hashed out (#) comments?
<Krakass> The colon isn't necessary. Just the name.
<PonyImp> just local host
<Krakass> Wrek, from what I was reading online there is no bullet drop.
<RankWinner> Well, at least we know that isn't the problem.
<pyrocatboy> Krakass: Its a habit.
<Lonlymare> Krakass: They should add it then :P
<Krakass> POA=POI
<RankWinner> I guess that now the only thing you could do is look around your firewall/antivirus settings
<RankWinner> And if that fails then try calling your ISP
<Lonlymare> good shot.
<pyrocatboy> 18
<Meanwhile> Did anyone else hear "woopwoopwoopwoop" in their head when that ghoul was coming?
<Lonlymare> Just you
<Airpuff> xDD
<twilight_sprinkle> zombie zoidberg?
<PonyImp> i've actually had a virus scan going on in the background
<Meanwhile> \)v3v(/
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey everypony
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ooh, Fallout Vegas
<Meanwhile> Allo Very_Silly_Filly.
<Airpuff> Yeps x)
<Krakass> Hello Extremely_Silly_Filly
<pyrocatboy> ello silly
<Lonlymare> Wrek is trying to find the graves.
<Airpuff> thats a funny name xD
<pyrocatboy> 19
<RankWinner> I doubt a virus scan could affect your internet connectivity, however it could be a problem. Wait for the scan to finish and try again
<pyrocatboy> BOOM HEADSHOT!
<pony_335403> thats a silly name
<Very_Silly_Filly> Suprised you don't know me anywhere, you new?
<RankWinner> In the mean time you could call your ISP and check to see if anybody else has called in for a similar problem.
<pyrocatboy> 20
<pyrocatboy> BOOM HEADSHOT!
<Airpuff> Im new o.o
<Airpuff> Yeah
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ahh, okay, *Wonka pose* Explains it all
<Airpuff> If you were talking to me >.<
<Krakass> PonyImp, do you have another computer available to test the internet connection? Or even a phone with wifi?
<PonyImp> Yes, the computer in the other room does the same thing with google sites
<Renard> What did you unplug
<Lonlymare> only twenty in lockpick?
<Lonlymare> and 14 in science.
<Lonlymare> :P
<Meanwhile> Why pick locks when you can shoot bitches?
<Wrek|Observing> 05implying you are famous Very_Silly_Filly
<RankWinner> Yeah, PonyImp try calling up your ISP and asking them for help
<Airpuff> Science.. you know none =c
<pony_3654> malware can easily screw with your internet connection. there is actually an FBI DNS server running right now that was put into place after a Malware generating company was taken down. they had to create a DNS server because if they didn't 100k+ people all over the would would have lost internet
<Lonlymare> Because picking locks leads to more shit more shit leads to shooting bitches :DP
<Lonlymare> :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's not implying I'm Famous, Wrek|Observing I'm implying I'm a reg. ;)
<Meanwhile> Very_Silly_Filly: I don't remember you.
<pyrocatboy> 21
<Airpuff> Reg? =s
<Very_Silly_Filly> Meanwhile: Fazana
<Meanwhile> NOW I remember you.
<Lonlymare> I seen filly ONCE.
<pony_3654> that is why I asked if you have put google DNS servers into our router. to see if it is a DNS problem or not
<Lonlymare> :P
<Meanwhile> Very_Silly_Filly: why the name change?
<Very_Silly_Filly> My pops has been growing suspicious of my bronyism
<MelaPonie> pony_3654, sounds like one of those malware things that change where your browser looks to find the internet
<RankWinner> If I remember correctly (I probably don't) that was through changing the hosts files and they are fine for PonyImp
<Airpuff> Very_Silly_Filly: Dosent matter if youre "famous" or not, nice to meetcha xD
<Very_Silly_Filly> He hates bronies more than I hate sprouts.
<Airpuff> Omg! That gasstation!!! I remember that one xD
<Meanwhile> How old're you Very_Silly_Filly?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I am 15 and 3 days old :)
<pony_335403> when you have problems with you internet..come to brony state
<Airpuff> =O 3 days of pure age. xD
<RankWinner> xD I'm 16 and 1 day old
<Meanwhile> Then realistically the answer is "Deal with it"
<PonyImp> It's the only place I knew to go D:
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, it was my birthday on Tuesday
<Very_Silly_Filly> So I mean 2 days
<Krakass> I'm 10 years and 105834 days old.
<Krakass> Or something like that.
<Digitalis> o.o
<Airpuff> ô.o
<RankWinner> PonyImp the only thing you could try is using a mobile phone or another wireless device that you could use to check those websites
<Very_Silly_Filly> Krakass: Wouldn't that make you over 1 thousand years old?
<Digitalis> O_O
<PonyImp> I actually tried on my phone, but it went to the mobile site
<Krakass> Very_Silly_Filly, Celstia is my cousin.
<Airpuff> that would need to be like 365000 right?
<Airpuff> x)
<RankWinner> There will usually be a way to go to the main site, something like a link at the bottom
<Very_Silly_Filly> Shaddap, I'm exaggerating
<Meanwhile> 19 years old.
<Krakass> 365250
<Airpuff> Ahahaha
<RankWinner> Or you could try going to the mobile site on your computer
<Krakass> A year is 365.25 days long
<Meanwhile> And probably shorter than all of you.
<pony_3654> well, if the computer in the other room is having the same problem then it isn't a problem with your computer but a problem with your router or ISP. crack your router and enter 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 into the DNS server slots
<Krakass> Meanwhile, they facial hair compensates.
<Krakass> the*
<Meanwhile> True.
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's 365.249999999999999999(and a million more 9's)4 actually
<Krakass> The chicks probably don't even notice you're shorter than them once they see it.
<Very_Silly_Filly> As metoers in the past have screwed the time up
<Meanwhile> Har de har har.
*RankWinner cough.
<RAWRity> Philosopher: "If a tree falls in the woods, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" Hipster Philosopher: "Yes it does, and I bought it's first EP...ON VINYL
<RAWRity> "
<Airpuff> Let us all pick up a fan and slow down the earth!!!!
<RankWinner> The earth slows down naturally because of the moon and other planets anyway.
<OtakuTom> Hi everyypony!

<RAWRity> Varyan: al I can think of there is Ophelia in Hamlet drowning.
<Dark92Enigma> Krakass Dial ''e'' for Enigma
<Krakass> What do you mean no nudity?
<Airpuff> Varyan: Pretty suggestive dotcha think? xD
<Krakass> She's barely covering herself.
<Airpuff> And... no nudity? xD
<Very_Silly_Filly> IMO, I fail to see how it's sexy
<Airpuff> She IS nude o.o
<Varyan> Well, no dutity is a bad choice of words
<Meanwhile> Beggin yer' pardon but they don't normally wear clothes.
<Krakass> She's entirely naked.
<Varyan> Ok no genitalia better ?
<Shirtless_Tempest> ponies are always naked
<Airpuff> Now that's better. xD
<Krakass> Meanwhile, you and Trixie are nudists?
<Ninjazz> A bit suggestive though... But no problems on my end.
<Meanwhile> Shaddup Krakass.

<Krakass> He carries a reloading press with him.
<Meanwhile> What does that rifle shoot? bbs?
<stalker_oo> oh shit those fing eeeyyes
<stalker_oo> ;__;

<WallMaster> idle curiosity, but whats the hardest game you (anyone) has played?
<Very_Silly_Filly> That one shoots 12 gauge I think
*Trixie Lick Meanwhile
<Very_Silly_Filly> The other one shoots 357

<Very_Silly_Filly> I think....:s
<Uakh> easy
<Ninjazz> Personally, Varyan. I thought it was good but pushing it a tiny bit.
<RankWinner> Chat exploding, if this is actually being typed then I'm refreshing.
<Uakh> does it have cell shading ?
<pyrocatboy> Trixie: -hugs back-
<PonyImp> why couldnt it have killed walmart related sites
<WallMaster> anyone else?
<Uakh> and a claw
<Viri> 14today I ran for about a km without stopping because my bus was in late and I was in a hurry
<Shirtless_Tempest> very true, prince-dari. Those are the best of all Prince of Persia games.
<Wrek|Observing> 05Varyan: please read the rules at the rules tab.
<Wrek|Observing> 05:3
<Varyan> Yeh but if I get a warn I better stop :p Don't want to make anyone angry

<Phase4-> and you missed it
<PonyImp> it wants the cookies. ALL THE COOKIES
<Krakass> There are rules under the rules tab? Who would have guessed.
<PonyImp> in return of my youtube
<RankWinner> I missed Episode 3 release?
<Krakass> PonyImp, bypass the router entirely
*Phase4- wants this soundtrack
<Uakh> prince-dari: I enjoyed PoP 2008 more than sands of time or warior within tbh
<Digit|Celebrating> Wait there are rules?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Krakass: Huh, since when!?
<Digit|Celebrating> well shit.
<Uakh> don't ban me for that D:
<Very_Silly_Filly> (Yes, I've always known that)
<Phase4-> which soundtrack is this song in
<PonyImp> My ISP said something about running the internet directly from the modem or something.. idk
<RankWinner> PonyImp, just out of curiosity, what is your internet speed?
<Krakass> Very_Silly_Filly, I don't know. I still haven't gone to that page.
<prince-dari> Which one is the 2008 one?
<Dark_Horst> rules? really? no wai!!
<Uakh> the one with cell shading
*Trixie cinderblocks Very_Silly_Filly
<PonyImp> idk how to do any of that, ima wait for my tech support to get home :p
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sands of time isn't it?
<Phase4-> pony_335403: you'll have a router betwene you and the internet
<Phase4-> *derp*
<Uakh> that's only called "Prince of Persia"
<prince-dari> Oh fuck no
<drfsupercenter> 03why was your bus stop 1km away?
<Phase4-> i ment PonyImp
<Phase4-> so many anons
<prince-dari> A friend told me about that one.
<Airpuff> Man i wanna post a video..... -.-
<prince-dari> Apparently they totally fucked it up.
<Shirtless_Tempest> the movie?
<Uakh> you can't know unless you've played it
<RankWinner> Oh god
*RankWinner palms face.
<Dark92Enigma> WallMaster.........Tough call...does Spongebob: Battle for Bikini Bottom count? No.......Syphon Filter? Marvel Vs Capcom I? Street Fighter EX2 Plus? Scooby Doo and The Cyber Chase?...............NO WAIT, I GOT IT...GTA SAN ANDREAS!!! IT's so Awesome, and yet, i still can't get past it......
<Uakh> and personnaly I liked it a lot
<RankWinner> I forgot to ask this
<PonyImp> :( This sucks, this whole situation has shown me how little I actually know about networks n stuff
<RankWinner> PonyImp are you on wireless?
<Very_Silly_Filly> prince-dari: Never listen to other people, unless it's REALLY obvious.
<WallMaster> EX2+ and MvC1 wasnt hard.
<Phase4-> PonyImp: never too late to learn
<Airpuff> PonyImp: Whats wrong?? =s
<Very_Silly_Filly> That's how I get through life
<PonyImp> uh, i have an ethernet cable in my pc for the internet
<RankWinner> Ah good
<PonyImp> so i guess wired
<Shirtless_Tempest> ded
<Airpuff> Thats good... *-*
<LunaTheBeloved> Afternoon everypony
<WallMaster> for me, Tower of Druaga.

<Uakh> and PoP 2008 is at like $5 on Steam iirc
<Krakass> Wrek got wreked. Boom, headshot
<Ninjazz> LunaTheBeloved, welcome.
<Lonlymare> lol SUDDENLY RADSCORP
<RankWinner> Basically... take the cabe out of your router and plug it into your wall
<Phase4-> i must go to bed
<prince-dari> I trust my friend's opinion when it comes to PoP
*Digitalis pokes Shirtless_Tempest
<Uakh> maybe $10
<prince-dari> He loves it too
<pony_335403> dat song
<prince-dari> Completed SoT on a dance mat.
<Varyan> In my country internet providers just offer rippoffs
<WallMaster> I love and HATE that game.
*Phase4- has to eventualy wake for uni tomorow
<Phase4-> night everyone
<RankWinner> The problem there would be that your landline phone might fail a bit and so might your internet
<Uakh> yeah, but SoT was completely different
<Ninjazz> Gnight Phase4-!
<Uakh> tbh they're not the same game
<Ninjazz> Take care.
*Shirtless_Tempest gives a manly squeak and glomps Digitalis.
<WallMaster> night Phase4-.
<RankWinner> Night Phase4
<prince-dari> And just from looking at the game I can tell I hate it.
<Airpuff> Night Phase
<prince-dari> Prince looks stupid
<Uakh> the gameplay, art direction and backstory are totally different
<prince-dari> Some weird head bandana thing
<Very_Silly_Filly> prince-dari: Doin't talk about yourself :P
*Digitalis glomps Shirtless_Tempest back "hey guess what?"
<Ninjazz> Sounds like Sands of Time is a must play.
<Uakh> you can use another skin like SoT
<PonyImp> Btw, what's up with the twilight sprite reading at the side > _ > ???
<Shirtless_Tempest> Digitalis: what? cake?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Desktop ponys
<RankWinner> CAKE?!
<WallMaster> CAKE?
<Uakh> and you get used to it anyway
<Lonlymare> Pony shes cloping :P
<Krakass> PonyImp, it's part of the ponymark identification system.
*RankWinner is dissapoint.
<Varyan> I got those desktop ponies for myself too :p
<prince-dari> It looks all weird and cartoony too
<Ninjazz> PonyImp: She's Wrek watermark and favorite pony.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Midnight_Tempest: Remember, I stole all your cake
<prince-dari> Fucking stupid
<Uakh> it is weird and cartoony
<RankWinner> What does?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Don't judge a game on it's graphics.
<Uakh> but in a good way
<Airpuff> I wounder.. is it possible to "finish" Tetris?
<Ninjazz> Well, my brother liked it.
<Digitalis> No even better, I managed to convince my bf to watch an episode of MLP, instead he just finished watching 2 and is gonna watch about 4 more in about 40 mins :D
<prince-dari> Sorry, but I really don't like it when they radically change a good game series like that.
<PonyImp> .. is it a steam related thing or is it just for the video recording?

<prince-dari> It's not the same game in any way.
<prince-dari> It's something different.
<Lonlymare> My desktop pony (not that I am a streamer) Is octavia.
<Shirtless_Tempest> Digitalis: nice
<prince-dari> And I hate it.
<RankWinner> Arrr what game are ye' even talking about?
<Digitalis> I'm still freaking out now xD
<prince-dari> Because it's got the same name as something I like.
<ShadowSparkle> ...
<Dark92Enigma> WallMaster EX2 and MVC were hard........ON THEIR HARDEST DIFFICULTY (for me, at least)
<prince-dari> And has nothing to do with it.
<RankWinner> Syndicate..?
<Krakass> PonyImp, they put it there so you can tell who is streaming.
<Airpuff> So.. much.. talking *-*
<Ninjazz> RankWinner: Prince of Persia
<Varyan> Best game ever for me is still Warcraft III. Got 3000 playing hours on it <3:D
<PonyImp> oh
<pablez94> hi everypony! how are ya?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey RAWRity look http://i50.tinypic.com/2eqgpbm.png
<RankWinner> Ah, thanks for telling me xD
<Airpuff> O.o
<prince-dari> This is like Spyro Skylanders.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pissing hell? 3 THOUSAND!?
<PonyImp> :( They should have a steam mod that lets you put a pony watermark in your games anyways...... rofl
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: saved.
<Ninjazz> CLASH!
<Lonlymare> PonyImp: Most of the streamers use a desktop pony. so they can be identifyed. Wrek use twi Sumica uses flur Shizuka uses Roseluck
<Renard> Dat Caravan Palace
<prince-dari> I wouldn't call that a Spyro game, Spyro 1/2/3 were so good, then that thing has the same name, but just looks like a giant shit on my childhood to me.
<ACS13123> dat song...
<Trixie> Dat plot
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity /)
<MakerDusk> lol prince-dari
<RankWinner> Dawww my highest game time is probably GMod at something around 1,700 hours
<Very_Silly_Filly> Haha,
<MakerDusk> yes, spyro went down hill
<Varyan> First n second spyro were da best
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: (\
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wow, I feel better now
<MakerDusk> simply to ruin our childhoods
<Lonlymare> LOL DYNAMITE!
<Very_Silly_Filly> My highest played game is L4D2 with 250 hours
<Lonlymare> Wrek|Observing: you so oldschool :D
<Renard> prince-dari, worry not for the developers feel the same about this game
<PonyImp> :( I just searched for desktop ponys and it set my antivirus off
<Radu> This tune.
<Ninjazz> TF2 with 450 hrs
<Radu> This tune is epic.
<Trixie> Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT !
<Viri> 14drf, I take 2 bus
<Uakh> I dunno, I just consider PoP 2008 as a different game. If you take it independantly it's pretty good. But yeah it has hardly anything to do with the SoT trilogy
<prince-dari> Everyone wants to ruin our childhoods Maker. :<
<MakerDusk> XD
<Renard> they were told to apply the Spyro brand to a project of their own
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi Trixie
<Very_Silly_Filly> prince-dari: I blame CoD
<MakerDusk> so true
<Trixie> :)
<Viri> 14the first one was in a huge late
<Ninjazz> I blame CoD...
<pablez94> hi everypony! how are u?
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Uakh> though you HAVE to agree that it can't be worse than the latest PoP
<drfsupercenter> 03y u no have parent drive you
<Ninjazz> pablez94, welcome.
<Lonlymare> PonyImp: Desktop ponys is perfectly safe your antivirus must suck use avast.
<Trixie> Hi pablez94 Welcome
*Trixie licks Ninjazz
<PonyImp> Can anyone link the safe website to download the desktop pony app?
<Ninjazz> Oi.
<Varyan> Well tbh WC3. Iv'e owned it since it's release and I still play atleast 5 hours a week. My record was 2 years ago during Winter holidays. 300 hours in 3 weeks XD
<Digitalis> Oi the licking
<Trixie> XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> The series has made everyone graphic hungry, and how can they keep playing such a repetetive game, which gets the same thing with better graphics under a new title every year
*Ninjazz rolls newspaper and bonks Trixie
<pony_335403> if you cant kill with bullets...use dynamite
<Ninjazz> Don't lick me.
<Renard> PonyImp, sudo apt-get install desktop-ponies
*Trixie Cinderblocks Ninjazz
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Ninjazz> Ow.
<Renard> … i wish
<prince-dari> Very_Silly_Filly: CoD for the campaign
*pablez94 "finallt someone herad me!!" licks Ninjazz and Trixie
*Trixie licks Ninjazz
<Ninjazz> Argh!
<Lonlymare> PonyImp: http://www.desktopponies.com/
*Renard licks Trixie
*Trixie Licks pablez94
<Ninjazz> Two licks at the same time?
<Varyan> I only bought MW3 for the survival mode XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> Not for me, I even hate the campaign because it's just so repetitive,
<Ninjazz> Ehhh. Not bad, I suppose.
*Trixie lick renard
<PonyImp> Renard: what??
<Shirtless_Tempest> CoD is such a boring series now... like most FPS games
<pablez94> Ninjazz: eeeeyeep
<prince-dari> MP is fun too, though I still like MW2 MP the most.
<Uakh> CoD ewww
<Dark_Horst> so does his whole gameplay so far consist of using low-level firepower to kill high-level critters
<Dark_Horst> ?
<PonyImp> woot ty lonleymare :3
<Viri> 14^^;
<Ninjazz> CoD4 FTW!
<Ninjazz> Best one.
<Viri> 14how are you? :3
<Very_Silly_Filly> Dark_Horst: No, Wrek is low level
<prince-dari> I don't know why people expect the games to be so radically different though, how can an FPS based on modern warfare vary that much?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ninjazz i must remember you that you are indirectly getting lick by Meanwhile too
<Shirtless_Tempest> CoD FTL...
<Dark_Horst> Ninjazz: correction: the only good one
<Uakh> CoD went downhill after CoD5 WaW
<prince-dari> Other than in its storyline, which it does
<MakerDusk> XD
<Lonlymare> Dark_Horst: No Wrek is apperintly low level and does not have some of the better guns yet.
<MakerDusk> it's doesn't
<Varyan> Ninjazz: Best one yes but it also had the most freaks ^^
<MakerDusk> that's the point
<drfsupercenter> 03the usual
<Renard> PonyImp, just use an OS for real men with some decent package management, whichever you choose. (trollin')
<Ninjazz> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Huwhat do you mean by that?...
<MakerDusk> you like the genre
<Very_Silly_Filly> prince-dari: All they do is make a few new maps, add like 2 new weapons and add like 1 perk
<Airpuff> Whats Desktop Ponies? o.o
<prince-dari> I know, but what do you expect them to do?
<Viri> 14D:
<Krakass> Renard I hate you so much. You lie.
<Ninjazz> Varyan: And what do you mean by that?
<Viri> 14don't worry, I'll be more active here from the next week, I swear
<Very_Silly_Filly> And 1 a year is obviously money hungry
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ninjazz trixie and meanwhile o guess you can make the connection
<prince-dari> New weapons, new maps, new storyline, new perks, what more are you asking for?
<Dark_Horst> Lonlymare: well yeah, he IS shooting the higher tier ones
<Ninjazz> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: O_O
<drfsupercenter> 03did I say it had anything to do with you?
*drfsupercenter runs
<prince-dari> It's meant to be a continuation along the same theme
<Renard> Krakass, let's bring desktop-ponies into the Debian repositories!
*Ninjazz shudders
<MakerDusk> prince-dari: better graphics and physics!
<Varyan> Ninjazz: Well it had just much more hardcor eplayers
<Shirtless_Tempest> the point of an FPS is to shoot everything... now adding a storyline to that, that is actually compelling and good... thats what i look for
<prince-dari> Or they wouldn't just be called MW1, MW2, MW3, etc.
<MakerDusk> also, better AI
<Krakass> I'm way to lazy to do anything like that.
<Ninjazz> Varyan: But for good reason!
<Krakass> But it'd be a good idea
<PonyImp> It doesn't seem like there's enough visual feedback when you shoot things in fallout, kind of makes combat feel boring.
<Ninjazz> It was awesome!
<prince-dari> Well, TBH I think CoD graphics are all worse past MW2
<prince-dari> MW2 still had best IMO
<Lonlymare> Dark_Horst: because he thinks this is how to level fast :P it's better to kill lower levels faster then repetedly ddie to higher levels. personally his weapons suck too.
<Viri> 14x3
<WallMaster> I dont play many shooters..
<Very_Silly_Filly> But that's the thing, I can understand one per 3 years or so
<Ninjazz> TBH CoD graphics is just Quake 3 with added visuals.
<Viri> 14I mean, I will be more avaiable to talk :3
<Very_Silly_Filly> But there's too many games in short time
<RAWRity> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3oek3t/
<Dark_Horst> you know, ir eally doubt the exp gain and pison glands from these are worth the enormous ammo-amounts
<prince-dari> Can you blame them if every year people continue to buy the game?
<drfsupercenter> 03heh whatever
<Varyan> Biggest problem in modern FPS games. You don't get to play with people on the same level as you
<MakerDusk> XD
<prince-dari> Hardly their fault if people are willing to buy it
<drfsupercenter> 03I need to go turn in some forms
<drfsupercenter> 03so that I can host my radio show tomorrow
<Uakh> Portal 2 is best FPS. Period.
<pony_562425> Hi guys
<prince-dari> Ain't no supply without demand. :P
<WallMaster> dari, with dat common sense.
<drfsupercenter> 03the usual blah blah I won't swear on the air etc
<Ninjazz> I rent the new CoDs now.
<Viri> 14oh?
<HyperMetalLugia> hmmm
<Viri> 14you have a radio show? :D
<Dark_Horst> ded
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm going to
<drfsupercenter> 03first one will be tomorrow
<Viri> 14about? I hope ponies :DDD
*Viri runs
<drfsupercenter> 03NO.
<Very_Silly_Filly> True that, but because it's so frequently released, hardly anything gets added.
<prince-dari> In CoD your level doesn't matter much
<Viri> 14:P
<drfsupercenter> 03Thank god it's not a talk show or I'd spend my 2 hours ranting about how much I hate bronies :D
<HyperMetalLugia> heyas DRF
*TrixieBack lick PonyImp Ninjazz prince-dari MakerDusk Very_Silly_Filly Airpuff Varyan TheGreatAndPowerfulT Krakass Shirtless_Tempest Dark_Horst <WallMaster XD
<prince-dari> You usually get the best guns from level 5 or something anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> how is your droid 4
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drfsupercenter> 03but nah, I'm going to just be playing music
<Varyan> Nah best FPS is still plain old Paintball with friends. Gets your ass of the chair and you have much more fun
<drfsupercenter> 03and it'll be 80s and 90s dance music
<Digitalis> o.o
<MakerDusk> TrixieBack: why you highlight people?
<RAWRity> I've noticed: CoD is pretty much just a contest to see who can hit the trigger first.
<Viri> 14I'd love to open a radio channel too
<drfsupercenter> 03and yes HML I'll be sure to play the Safety Dance at some point
<Viri> 14but I live in italy
<Viri> 14= siae
<Digitalis> haha you poor souls, being licked
<Shirtless_Tempest> i was licked... HUZZAH!
<prince-dari> Not really RAWRity.
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's not like MY station or anything
*Ninjazz rolls newspaper and bonks TrixieBack
<Airpuff> Very_Silly_Filly: Wat? xD
<drfsupercenter> 03this college has a radio station
<TrixieBack> :) I licked everypiny:)
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's entirely student run
<TrixieBack> *pony
<Ninjazz> Don't lick everypony.
<prince-dari> If you're good you can turn to shoot people even if they're shooting at your back
<prince-dari> Or if they're bad.
<drfsupercenter> 03so all you have to do is be like "hey I go here and like music, can I have a show?"
<prince-dari> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03and just pick an open time slot XD
<Dark_Horst> hey Wrek|Observing , find the crashed vertibird and attack the robots there. it will be fun
*TrixieBack LICK NINJAZZ!
<LightTrooper105> CoD focus more on Close Quarters so speed and fast reaction much be there
<Viri> 14= a "company" that, other than all the crap they do, they also say "WELL WELL YOU WANT TO HOST A WEB RADIO? YOU MUST PAY US LOL"
<Ninjazz> Don't...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Varyan: I would do paintball, but mum won't let me because my brother was almost killed in paintbalk
<drfsupercenter> 03oh this isn't web radio
<Uakh> I have poor aiming skills, I have to play medic or pyro in TF2 :<
<drfsupercenter> 03it's actual FM radio
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/x9yCl.jpg
<Varyan> TrixieBAck: I just came back from a work-out session and haven't showered yet. Better wash your tongue :p
<Viri> 14D:
<MakerDusk> TrixieBack: I'd recommend not highlighting a network admin like that, simply because we do have a few evaders that like doing that >_<
<Viri> 14how do I listen to you then :((
*pablez94 licks twice evrerypony
<TrixieBack> :O
<drfsupercenter> 03online stream
<prince-dari> Very_Silly_Filly: Almost killed in paintballing, wut?
<Very_Silly_Filly> So instead, I do racing
<TrixieBack> ok
<Digitalis> AH no licking!
<Digitalis> dammit now it burns
<PonyImp> GUYS
<drfsupercenter> 03but it broadcasts in FM, and just has a secondary online stream :P
<Ninjazz> Shizuka: Dot plot? :S
<PonyImp> OH MY GOD GUYS!!!!! YOUTUBE IS WORKING!@#$!@$r#!@
<Very_Silly_Filly> prince-dari: He broke his rib, and it just missed his lung.
<WallMaster> youtube wasnt?
*TrixieBack molest Ninjazz

<Ninjazz> Oi.
<drfsupercenter> 03I gotta figure out what order I want to play these
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/apr/26/tor-rips-rulebook-digital-rights-management?newsfeed=true
<Varyan> Very_Silly_Filly: How can you almost be killed in paintball ? The worst injury you can get is loosing your eye if you're dumb enough to take off your mask
<Ninjazz> You ain't no Molestia.
<Shirtless_Tempest> youtube wasnt working? you can see all the f:oks i give on this blank piece of paper...
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<MakerDusk> prince-dari: we've all done stupid things while paintballing
<HyperMetalLugia> FreetheEbook!!
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<MakerDusk> my worse was the moltovs at the bunker >_<
<drfsupercenter> 03Tor, the world's biggest science fiction publisher and home to authors including Orson Scott Card, <- Tor is also an anonymous p2p network
<Dark_Horst> Very_Silly_Filly: sounds like he fell. you can fall everywhere. paintball didn't dot it
<drfsupercenter> 03which is the first thing I thought of
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Very_Silly_Filly> I wasn't there, but according to him, he wasn't wearing proper chest armour
<MakerDusk> seemed like a good idea at the time
<Dark92Enigma> PonyImp YES, it worked since i came back an hour ago
<prince-dari> You don't need chest armour for painballing
<prince-dari> They just bruise
*TrixieBack molest Ninjazz
<drfsupercenter> 03also wtf?
<MakerDusk> prince-dari: of course not
<drfsupercenter> 03JK Rowling's recently launched ebooks, sold exclusively from her site Pottermore, are already DRM-free. <- I could have sworn I saw ads on Amazon's front page for Kindle editions...
*Ninjazz rolls up newspaper and bonks TrixieBack
<MakerDusk> but if you play with us, you might need something flame retardant
<prince-dari> I just don't get how he managed to get that badly hurt though
<PonyImp> RankWinner: ITS FIXED =O
<Ninjazz> Don't molest ponies.
<Viri> 14lol
<Dark_Horst> Very_Silly_Filly: paintballs can't cause any more damage than superficial bruises.
<TrixieBack> :)
<Krakass> Just gain weight. Then you don't need chest armor.
<RankWinner> PonyImp =D Good! What was the problem?
<Viri> 14why would you put DRMs on books o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03because people are stupid?
<drfsupercenter> 03and put DRM on everything
<Ninjazz> Okay, Wrek. That was just silly :D
<LightTrooper105> ^
<PonyImp> RankWinner: It started working on it's own! I just went and tried again and now it works
<LightTrooper105> using a shovel what a great idea :D
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I argue so strongly against Skylanders and such as that's a whole new type of DRM that's even more obnoxious than the current kind -_-
<Ninjazz> Attack radscorps with a shovel? GENIOUS
<RankWinner> Fair enough xD
<Magic> hello everypony
<Digitalis> works everytime.
<Shirtless_Tempest> ded
<Varyan> Very_Silly_Filly: He probably lied. I've been hit in the chest with a paintball-shotgun at close range without protection and all I got was a huge bleeding bruise. Something else happened and he just found the best lie to tell
<MakerDusk> prince-dari: do you think moltovs are against paintball rules?
<LightTrooper105> hello Magic
<WallMaster> hi Magic.
<MakerDusk> if so, whoops
<PonyImp> Also, desktop ponies are AWESOME :D Good news x 2
<RankWinner> Out of curiosity what is your internet speed PonyImp?
<pablez94> hi Magic
<Very_Silly_Filly> You never know, that's possibly the caase
<Ninjazz> Magic, welcome.
<Viri> 14?
<Magic> wats up
<pyrocatboy> Dark_Horst: The paintball could have been frozen or something.
<Viri> 14what's that about?
<PonyImp> How do i check that
<Ninjazz> Wrek is getting piiiiiiiised.
<prince-dari> MakerDusk: As in a petrol bomb? O_o
*TrixieBack Molests Magic
<drfsupercenter> 03you have to buy these plastic figurines in order to "unlock" parts of the game >_>
<MakerDusk> prince-dari: the one and only XD
<PonyImp> all i know about my internet speed is, it's not dial up :P
<prince-dari> O___O
<Viri> 14oh right
<MakerDusk> we were drunk at the time
<Very_Silly_Filly> Petrol bombs, wouldn't that be illegal in public?
<MakerDusk> Very_Silly_Filly: probably
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm fine with them releasing collectible figures but the fact that they're *part* of the game that you *have* to have
<RankWinner> PonyImp go to http://www.speedtest.net/ and begin the test
<drfsupercenter> 03is just stupid
<prince-dari> Damn, I need paintball with you guys' rules.
<Viri> 14well, I remember Path of Radiance, a GC game about Fire Emblem
<prince-dari> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03and therefore I'm going to hate it like it's Satan :P
<KwakLad> Trixie: are you friends with Meanwhile?
<Viri> 14you had to buy the GBA games in order to unlock some levels
<RAWRity> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/36fkux/
<Viri> 14:P
<drfsupercenter> 03what about Path of Radiance
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<MakerDusk> medi-pack all the way \o/
<drfsupercenter> 03I pirated that
<drfsupercenter> 03and it still worked
<drfsupercenter> 03::P
<Very_Silly_Filly> The point is, he broke his rib, and it missed his lung JUST
<drfsupercenter> 03*:P
<RankWinner> The big one in the middle, not the adds to the side or the top
<Varyan> Still frozen the paintball wouldn't do that. I'm a really stupid guy and have tried alot of stupid stuff and I tell you. It's impossible to be hurt any othe rway than falling and being shot in your eye
<drfsupercenter> 03OK well
<Trixie> KwakLad: eeyup Why?
<drfsupercenter> 03adding *Extra* functionality is fine
<Viri> 14you must buy gba games to unlock some levels xD
<MakerDusk> there was this bunker... you basically needed grenades
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ribs can puncture your lung, and cause it to bleed inside it, which is fatal
<MakerDusk> so we improvised XD
<Krakass> I don't know. Flamethrowers are illegal in most states. I assume a molotov cocktail wouldn't be either. The use of it might be, aka arson.
<drfsupercenter> 03but you literally cannot beat Skylanders without buying the figurines
<Shirtless_Tempest> paintball + molotov's? hell yeah, that sounds wicked
<drfsupercenter> 03which is STUPID AS F**
<KwakLad> it suprises me while you have that name Trixie :p
<Dark_Horst> pyrocatboy: i still doubt that would break a rib. it takes a lot more mass behind an impact to do that
<PonyImp> RankedWinner: 15.5 mbps DL speed
<Krakass> Very_Silly_Filly, it can be fatal. But not very likely.
<Dark_Horst> the force would have to be spread over a larger area than a paintball is in diameter
<Viri> 14ah o.o
<Very_Silly_Filly> Even when someone has pretty crappy bones? :s
<RankWinner> o__o and upload?
<Trixie> KwakLad Does he not like trixie
<Viri> 14also brb cooking
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't even care about the game itself, it's just a retarded concept that I won't support
<Viri> 14I don't eat since yesterday's lunch
<drfsupercenter> 03brb myself, going to turn in these papers
<PonyImp> .85 mbps
<Krakass> Dark_Horst, F=MA so it could be heavy or fast
<RankWinner> Freaking US and your fast internet speeds =/
<Very_Silly_Filly> DED
<Varyan> What you want to do is bring a riot shield to paintball events. In my club it's allowed as long as you only carry a pistol as weapon :D
<KwakLad> not at all, and quite the oposite Trixie
<Ninjazz> I shall be playing L4D2 with my brother. Anyone of you is welcome to join us.
<Airpuff> Omfg!! Desktop ponies.. i pressed GIVE ME PONIEs... and so.. i got about 112 ponies on my screen........
<fops> good morning ppl :)

<WallMaster> morning, fops.
<fops> how are you all today
<RankWinner> Dear god no, some parts do but the UK is horrid
<Trixie> KwakLad: We do get involved in a lot of rope shenanigans ;)
<Varyan> Airpuff: You've got to zero all pnies and then select those you want to keep
<PonyImp> RankedWinner: 22 ping
<Dark_Horst> Krakass: that would require a very precise hit though
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm not a fop :c
<RankWinner> Urgh
<Dark_Horst> very low chances
<KwakLad> o.O?
<Ninjazz|L4D2> Trixie: Bondage you mean.
<RankWinner> I pay like £15 a month ($25 a month) for my internet and it sucks
<Krakass> I believe South Korea has the fastest average internet
<Ninjazz|L4D2> ^
<PonyImp> idk how much we pay
<RAWRity> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35ckrm/
<MakerDusk> Very_Silly_Filly: the biggest risk in paintball is falling
<Dark92Enigma> Here's my sunday best....................PROTON CANNON
<Ninjazz|L4D2> They pride themselves on it.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I thought it was Sweden
<Trixie> Ninkazz|L4D2 : No you need some mind bleach
<Krakass> I pa y $45/month for 30 down 5 up
*SlurryMoon waves to chat

<Professor> Hello.

<Magic> hey
<MakerDusk> Celestia, I want to go paintballing now
<Ninjazz|L4D2> Airpuff: Ain't she great? ;)
<Varyan> Fastest internet ever is an old lady in norway. She can actually download a full 3 hour hd movie in 1 min. It's an experimental connection<3 I want it
<Airpuff> .__.
<Airpuff> Lovely
<Dark92Enigma> WallMaster in which sense.....badass or just bad? (I'll understand)
<KwakLad> Trixie: what rope shinanegans do you mean then?
<Krakass> Varyan, I believe they removed that as the test was over.
<Airpuff> Had to cancel the whole program xD
<WallMaster> Dark92Enigma: as in "not good in Mahvel".
<MakerDusk> first Sunday I get off after I start working again... I'm putting a team together
<KwakLad> yay dari bot is back, Very much appreciated prince-dari
<prince-dari> :>
<MakerDusk> think I want to do some milsim
<Trixie> KwakLad: Meanwhile doesn't like them last time I got our son involved
*SlurryMoon glomps Dari
<SlurryMoon> 3We all love him :)
*prince-dari hugs SlurryMoon
<Varyan> MakerDusk: Where do you live ? MAybe you can join my event ? It's in 2 weeks. 1000 people will come + 2 tanks + objective gaeplay and other fun stuff
<Ninjazz|L4D2> My new found love for dari-bot is slowly growing.

<PinkiePry> Hello everypony. :)
<Varyan> MakerDusk: Then you better get a plane ticket XD I live in Europe ^^
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello PinkiePry
<Ninjazz|L4D2> PinkiePry, welcome.
<WallMaster> hi PinkiePry.
<Magic> hey pinkie
<MakerDusk> Varyan: shame, I usually play on a private course built by a contracting team
<Trixie> KwakLad: (not real son)
<KwakLad> Trixie: you didnt?
<KwakLad> hang him?
<MakerDusk> it's a straight mashup of the call of duty maps
<Trixie> KwakLad : Maybe, maybe not
<SilverSonic|Android> Hello!
<MakerDusk> the only fees involved are your own gear, and the steaks
<Varyan> MakerDusk: Only eben in North America I've ever been to was the 2010 D-Day paintball event. I ended up with bruises all over my damn body
<Varyan> event*
<PonyImp> omg desktop ponies are so legit rofl
<KwakLad> so your son is dead but that might not be how it happened Trixie?
<MakerDusk> Varyan: I bet it was fun though
<Airpuff> xD Just dont let them invade your screen like they did to me xD
<Glitch> Kwadlad just so you know i'm bot dead
<Airpuff> Omg. The "Angel" is just fantastic, Just have to love the stare it gives ya x)
<Magic> wat u mean
<Trixie> KwakLad : Why so you think he is dead?
<Glitch> not*
<Varyan> MakerDusk: Fun as hell. Though At some point the temperature was 38°C (gotta convert that) butit was reaaaallly hot
<Trixie> lol
<WallMaster> Varyan: 100 F.
<Lonlymare> Wrek should get This Machine.
<Lonlymare> :P
<Lonlymare> seems t fit his play style
<Varyan> I still wonder why U.S. use Fahrenheit, Miles and other measurings like that XD
<thisguy> hi
<KwakLad> Trixie: just notions, i guess i was wrong since hes talking to me, hi Glitch
<Trixie> ;)
<Varyan> and some other countries too
*Ninjazz|L4D2 coughs
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh, I know this place

<thisguy> oh you siily filly
<Lonlymare> Or since he seems tyo like one handers..
<Lonlymare> Vance's smg.
<MakerDusk> Varyan: we use metric in canada >_<
<MakerDusk> we aren't savages!
<MakerDusk> :p
<pyrocatboy> :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Varyan: Britons use Miles too
<Trixie> Poor Glitch is not dead -hugs-
<WallMaster> officially, the U.S. uses metric too, just not in practice.
<Varyan> MakerDusk: Horay, anotehr reason to love your country :p
<LightTrooper105> well im off to bed night everypony!
<MakerDusk> we're not savages, we're just quiet
<Viri> 14back

<Varyan> Yeah and the Britons even drive left ... ^^ Silly people
<MakerDusk> and our elections such
<MakerDusk> *suck
<Airpuff> Da'w
<Magic> lol
<MakerDusk> there is history behind that
<thisguy> Da'wwwwww
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hay
<Varyan> My country is awesome except one thing. 80% of the population is racist
<Very_Silly_Filly> We've always driven left
<MakerDusk> since the french invented the standard, briton and the states vowed never to accept it
<Varyan> and intolerant
<Very_Silly_Filly> Varyan: Are you spanish?
<KwakLad> Shizuka: thats a lie, Friendship is Witchcraft clearly states that none of the mane 6 like spike
<Varyan> Nope from luxembourg
<thisguy> kwakland give me a high five
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ahh, so I presume spain is about 90% politically incorrect?
<KwakLad> (\
<MakerDusk> you know... paintballing with a bunch of germans in a war reenactment....
<MakerDusk> that would be boss
<Very_Silly_Filly> MakerDusk: Don't worry, you worry when you race petrol cars that belong to a Russian
<KwakLad> oh you said five, sorry thisguy i only have 4 hooves and if i use all of them it wont be ery high, ill be on my back :/
<Varyan> Spain is just ... no comment. I went there even in Madrid NO FUCKING ONE was able to speak single word in english. I had to use my broken knowledge of spanish to do everything
<MakerDusk> XD
<Wrek|Observing> 05varyan: stop beign entitled
<Ninjazz|L4D2> Not going to Spain then...
<thisguy> lyra!!!!!!!
<MakerDusk> here it's english, french, and whatever the natives speak
<Airpuff> Its time to make.......... DE MAGICKS!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ninjazz|L4D2: That's a steriotype
<PonyImp> How did you get twilight to sit in 1 spot with 1 continuous animation?
*Ninjazz|L4D2 checks Spain off check list
<Wrek|Observing> 05english speakers in general are very very entitled that everyoen should know english
<Varyan> What does entitled mean if I may ask ?
<Ninjazz|L4D2> Well either way...
<Varyan> English is my third language :p
<Very_Silly_Filly> Expectant, methinks? :s
<MakerDusk> Varyan: that by right every one else should know their language
<Kammerjunk|School> BREAKING NEWS: Archery declared best and most relaxing sport ever, participants rejoice!
<KwakLad> Wrek|Observing: im glad you qualified as 'in general' and not 'all english speakers'
<Very_Silly_Filly> I plan to learn Russian, my friend is teaching me
<Magic> cool
<Lonlymare> Wrek needs bigger guns :P
<MakerDusk> I still have to get around to learning german
<KwakLad> i hate only knowing english, i require more german
*MakerDusk shall make an effort after he learns ruby
<pablez94> sings along!
<thisguy> i love this song
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pops said he learned Russian in school, but he has forgotten the whole damn language
*ACS13123 sings along also!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Right
<MakerDusk> the thing that scares me is that we are the international communitiy that posseses the intelligence to realize all of this
<Very_Silly_Filly> I've been putting it off enough
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm off to get cake and other food
<Magic> i think knowing more than 1 language is cool
<MakerDusk> one day we'll have to take over, or let idiots run the world
<ACS13123> Very_Silly_Filly: Any muffins?

<Ninjazz|L4D2> I believe so, ACS13123.
<PonyImp> I don't wanna screw up the normal one though, can i duplicate a pony ?
<Ninjazz|L4D2> :$
<Litwick> This one strange game.
<Varyan> Maybe. I always use the mane 6 so i'm not really very proficient with it
<ACS13123> Ninjazz|L4D2 ive sent a friend request
<Glitch|School> Bored, calculus(spelling optional) class is boring
<Stallion_of_War> Ponies add me on steam? :(
<foxinator> brony q: how do you get your friends, who are completly against mlp, to watch it or atleased shut up about it beeing girly?
<foxinator> is there a brony steam groupe O.o if not we have to make one
*pablez94 dances
<FleetFox> Nothing interesting happening?
<Ninjazz|L4D2> Accepted, ACS13123.
<Stallion_of_War> foxinator THOU SHOULDST USE THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE ON THY FRIENDS
<Varyan> foxinator: Get them stoned or drunk then watch it. Worked for 2 of my friends
<Airpuff> xD
<foxinator> xD is there an app for the voice? would be very nice
<Varyan> foxinator: Though true friend shouldn't be that quick to judge ^^
<Ninjazz|L4D2> Alright. Now I am actually playing.
<Stallion_of_War> :(
<Memme> I bought this game yesterday! : D
<foxinator> i have made one of em brony and 1 watched the pilot the onthers wont stop call me jane :p
<Varyan> Please Canterlocks sounds even better ^^
<alexxm> i miss much my internet had to go down
<Glitch|School> nope nothing right now D:
<FleetFox> :(
<foxinator> lol drastic music change
<Stallion_of_War> If I bought this game... I could rename it Foal Out: New Pegasus :)
<ACS13123> foxinator the music changed?
<Memme> Stallion_of_War: Nice idea!
<Varyan> Worst thning is when you enjoy something you know is really stupid. For example I really like Dolan comics though I'm ashamed
<RustyMeat> lawl
<Airpuff> Stallion_of_War: Seems legit xD
<RustyMeat> Dolan
<RustyMeat> goofy pls
<pyrocatboy> 22
<Stallion_of_War> Varyan plz... dln cmics?
<foxinator> it did right? its all weared now
<Memme> It's a SWEDISH SONG!
<Memme> YAY!
<pyrocatboy> 23
<Airpuff> Yep >.>
<PonyImp> Varyan You can duplicate. Just make a copy of the pony's file, rename the file, then open it and go to the pony.config in the new copied file, and change the name value to "Rainbow Dash Idle" or something
<Bronysith> hiyas everypony
<Varyan> Yes. Dolan comics. MAke me laugh but I still wan tto kill me everytime I read one
<foxinator> dashy is only the 4th most loved pony at eqd
<foxinator> ;(
<Kammerjunk|School> Dolan is the worst meme ever.
<Bronysith> ha
<Airpuff> Whos the most loved?
<foxinator> twilight
<pyrocatboy> 24
<Airpuff> =O
<Bronysith> wait wat
<foxinator> than pinkie
<Bronysith> TWILIGHT
<Stallion_of_War> Was it just me or did Dashy give Fluttershy a kiss in the finale?
<Bronysith> she did
<thisguy> TWILIGHT!!!!!
<foxinator> the finale was so epic
<Varyan> Nah to me worst memes are stilla ll those Torres and Football posts. SO many reposts
<Memme> thisguy: I KNOW!
<Bronysith> the finale wasnt epic
<Bronysith> it was LEGENDARY
<foxinator> i sat on the floor yet i fell of my chaire O.o so epic
<Airpuff> xD
<Stallion_of_War> So... does that make Dashy cannonically a lespony?
<thisguy> it was the best thing ever
<prince-dari> Does the finale have a bad character, or is it like S1 finale?
<Airpuff> No.
<foxinator> dashy ant no lebo !
<pyrocatboy> 25
<WallMaster> prince-dari: there is a villian.
<RustyMeat> oh hai prince-dari
<Airpuff> No matter what.... Dashie will always be 20% cooler than the others ;P
<foxinator> dashy is most epic pony

<MakerDusk> but spoilers are fun!
<Viri> 14they upload their episodes on their website
<Wrek|Observing> 05MakerDusk.
<MakerDusk> they force everyone to be on their game XD
<Kammerjunk> Spoilers are bad and you should FEEL bad.
<alexxm> what the hell is dolan Kammerjunk|School
<Viri> 14you can watch them for free
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: Bad.
<Stallion_of_War> "Spoilers" - River Song
<Varyan> Depends. Only thing I want to be spoiled about Is my dinner tonight
<RustyMeat> Kammerjunk pls
<FleetFox> alexxm, you never wanna know
<MakerDusk> lol, I'm actually threatened with akills all the time for spoilers XD

<foxinator> weared oftopic q: i dont rly like my nick now that i've found out some other guyS alrdy ue it... how do i get an original new one? about 20% cooler than this one will do
<Varyan> I've been terribly spoiled one. A guy I know ALWAYS managed to know the content of Harry Potter books 3 months in advance. he kept telling me what ahppened :[
<ACS13123> alexxm: THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING!!!!
*pablez94 licks alexxm for 22.5 seconds
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, by making you watch ads and crap
<MakerDusk> prince-dari: I don't even want to think about what would happen to the poor idiot who send a global spoiler
<Viri> 14you can skip them o.o
<Radu> Ponies
<Stallion_of_War> I have a funny feeling that Season 3 will have Twilight Sparkle in it... just a guess though :P
<prince-dari> Ahahahaha
<MakerDusk> they'd probably be shunned from all that is pony
<prince-dari> Hung, drawn, and quartered I should expect
<Radu> Also, note: Every two parter has a villain.
<drfsupercenter> 03you can also block them with an ad blocker
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's not my point
<RustyMeat> lol.
<ACS13123> NO!
*Stallion_of_War dat giant lizard thing
<ACS13123> XD
<Stallion_of_War> ohh you dead
<foxinator> did s1 stop in a 2 part?
<RustyMeat> no
<Radu> Nope
<Varyan> My wish for Seaon 3. More Discord and more effin Luna
<foxinator> hmm
<Stallion_of_War> Gala was 1 parter and had no villian
<Dark_Horst> ah yes, the cowboy repeater
<MakerDusk> I'm pretty sure that person would be hunted by many different millitaries
<Chaosit> more Luna yaaaay!
<Dark_Horst> nice rifle. if the sights just werent so crappy
<ACS13123> BOOM HEADSHOT!
<twilight_sprinkle> did he find the grave?
<Radu> My only wish for S3: Ponies
<MakerDusk> hell, there might even be a Join Pony Task Force created for the purpose XD
<WallMaster> my only wish for S3: no humans.
<Chaosit> i hope S3 won't be T&J
<foxinator> luna is cooler than celestia
<Airpuff> Stallion_of_War: Fluttershy seemed like a Villian at times xD
<Radu> T&J?
<foxinator> shed.mov :p
<Chaosit> tom&Jerry
<Airpuff> You're giong to LOVE ME! xD
<Kammerjunk> Vivat Nox!
<Varyan> But Lyra wants to meet some humans so badly ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> i bet fluttershy was the evil mastermind of all villains all along
<Airpuff> xD
<prince-dari> S3, short for S3a ponies
<prince-dari> :>
<prince-dari> SOON.JPG
<RustyMeat> lolno
<twilight_sprinkle> imagine S3 ending: Betrayal of Fluttershy
<ACS13123> Airpuff: No its "Your, Going to LOVE ME!!!!:["
<Dark92Enigma> I had seen an earlier message a week ago ''the anti-spoiler time limit should be expired in an hour'' It wasn't my intention to spoil anything, I'm sorry........but i don't know anything about season 3, period.
<Airpuff> xDD
<WallMaster> Pony 24? that doesnt sound bad..
<Dark_Horst> my wish is that they make a three-parter. with less ads. 40 minutes isn't nearly enough room for all the awesome they crammed in there
<Krakass> I found out that in one of the middle episodes of S3 Twilight Sparkle rides a motorcycle and jumps over a shark tank with it.
<twilight_sprinkle> pic or gtfo
<Dark_Horst> some parts of the finale just felt so rushed. the disappearance of the royal guard, the celestia bossfight
<Varyan> Oh yeah and I want moar Derpy again. We need her
*pablez94 "btw can i still hug ya right?" hugs alexxm
<ACS13123> Fish in Equestria: IT IS NOW CANON! :D
<RustyMeat> oh man
<RustyMeat> celestia
*alexxm hugs pablez94 sure
<Stallion_of_War> So, Celestia is in charge of the Day, Luna is in charge of the night, and Cadence is in charge of Twilight
<MakerDusk> and the realization that we're in a pony drought sets in...
<Dark92Enigma> Again, i'm sorry, can i get back in character now?
<foxinator> what movie is up tonight?
<Varyan> Hahaha saw that post XD
<ACS13123> Stallion_of_War: Nice Pun :P
<CadanceTheBeloved> No movie tonight foxinator
<WallMaster> old pun is old.
<foxinator> lol
<alexxm> what is your character Dark92Enigma
<Airpuff> Its tomorrow =P
<twilight_sprinkle> S3 finale: Celestia is imprisoned, and the mane 6 get the elements of harmny, and then at the end Fluttershy is shown standing on a cliff, looking into the distance, laughing maniacally-and queue anime end credits music
<Dark_Horst> Stallion_of_War: ...it all makes ense now

<Dark92Enigma> alexxm OK, let's start with the cutie mark....Broken heart or Cross?
<prince-dari> To change another user's nick, GO GO GO ULTIMATE IRCOP ABUSE! XP
<Dark92Enigma> GO GO GADGET DO SOMETHING
<Stallion_of_War> one's own nick must be unbendable?
<MakerDusk> ya... we dropped anything that would let us do that
<Radu> Too bad RD Cutie Hat is $22
<prince-dari> Hahaha
<Stallion_of_War> otherwise one's nick will become corrupted?
<alexxm> not sure perhaps the broken heart over a cross Dark92Enigma
<foxinator> i want a t-shirt but i'm 16 and i cant randomly tell my parents, hey i'm a brony buy me a t-shirt so i can get bullied at school
<Radu> I'd buy it if it was cheaper
<MakerDusk> some with the module that let us puppet you guys >_<
<MakerDusk> *same
<prince-dari> Well, the urge to troll would be too great.
<prince-dari> :P
<LunaTheBeloved> Back
<Krakass> Admin's that don't abuse their power? What kind of world is this?
<Krakass> Admins*
<MakerDusk> it's a pony network, Krakass ^_^
<Icy> foxinator: same :D but still i bought some :D
<MakerDusk> it's a different type of place
<RankWinner> Ahh that brings back memories of good ol' times on GMod being a Admin...
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: youre new here, arent you
<alexxm> i rember when i got killed by ants in fallout
<MakerDusk> twilight_sprinkle: I'm older than the network is
<MakerDusk> I'm just not usually noticed
<foxinator> a hat i could do... :p
<Icy> u can get t-shirt whit RD cutimark 18$ :D
<foxinator> a t-shirt is to obviuos
<Radu> Icy, source?
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: thats odd, this place isnt any dif
<Icy> Radu: google Brony T-shirt and 1 link :D
<Radu> 1st link?
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm OK, check......next thing the leg warmers would be red with broken hearts in it too......what's the thing HBK carried to the ring? I mean before the Cowboy hat and t-shirt......
<Krakass> Not to seem like a complete and utter noob, but is there an easier way to rejoin when I'm kicked?
<Radu> Oh, cheers
<MakerDusk> 9,02at this rate I should choose an unreadable colour combination >_<
<MakerDusk> :p
<Krakass> I like that color combo
<Radu> inb4kick/ban
<Wrek|Observing> 05hmm
<Krakass> Perfectly readable.
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm i mean what was he wearing......i forgot the name
<Radu> Nice colour combo, but you're not allowed to use coloured fonts
<twilight_sprinkle> the color is blinding
<Wrek|Observing> 05my script should have autokicked, gona have to look into that
<Radu> xD
<Wrek|Observing> 05:3
<prince-dari> Wrek|Observing: You can't kick IRCOps
<prince-dari> :P
<alexxm> not sure i'm more familar with the newer stuff but i think so Dark92Enigma
<Wrek|Observing> 05radu
<Wrek|Observing> 05use colors
<Radu> Uhm
<MakerDusk> Wrek|Observing: did you not just notice prince-dari trying to kick me and then getting kick
<Krakass> 
<Icy> HERE is the link for pretty cheap MLP stuff http://www.redbubble.com/shop/brony+t-shirts
<MakerDusk> I then had to op him >_<
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: is immortal
<Wrek|Observing> 05damned ninja krakass
<prince-dari> But you can still ban them
<prince-dari> :P
<MakerDusk> actually...
*prince-dari doesn't get kicked this time
*prince-dari wins
<Radu> Uhm
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: if you cant be banned either, that will be epic
<MakerDusk> we can join channels regardless of keys, modes, and bans
<twilight_sprinkle> ahah
<twilight_sprinkle> OP
<Radu> ?
<Shizuka> 13and you never abuse that power do you
<prince-dari> Can you talk in the channel though?
<twilight_sprinkle> i would :3
<prince-dari> When +b or +q?
<MakerDusk> how else would we deal with staging channels on the network for botnet attacks
<pyrocatboy> 26
<Radu> 12inb4kick
<MakerDusk> prince-dari: I opped you, I could always give myself voice
<Radu> I need some practice, my friends
<MakerDusk> or even remove the +q with the same command
<MakerDusk> but all that is besides the point
<twilight_sprinkle> +q creates a field of E=k*q/r^2
<Litwick> anyone wanna play a game of Kid icarus with me?
<Magic> wat is that
<Floris> Hello everyone.
<prince-dari> So first we wait till services die, then we kb you and see how you do without operserv. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Magic *snort, snort*
<Krakass> Hello Florist
<Derpy-Master> hi floris
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello Floris
<MakerDusk> twilight_sprinkle: you'd be dealing with a BVP so you need a differential, not a general solution :p
<Aircrafter> Hey there Everypony! Wrek streaming F:NV?
<pyrocatboy> 27
*MakerDusk is a physicist, after all
<Magic> hey
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: wtf is a BVP?i know of no such acronym
<ehm> general IRC and IRCop info, for anyone interested: http://irchelp.org/
<Krakass> pyrocatboy, what are you counting? His kills?
<MakerDusk> boundary value problem
<Dark_Horst> ...why is his scope not waving? i could've sworn that sciope waved when i played
<Dark_Horst> ...or did it?
<foxinator> so apart from the fail urly on, what movie is it TOMOROW ?
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: besides, E is just a description of the field at some point r, i dont need potential for that :3
<twilight_sprinkle> for a point charge
<pyrocatboy> Krakass: One hit kills that I've seen.
<MakerDusk> twilight_sprinkle: you said a field
<MakerDusk> those eq'ns are different
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: yeah, electric field of a point charge
*MakerDusk was just being a know it all
<Dark_Horst> foxinator: it's all there on the homepage in a beautiful poster pic
<foxinator> what if i'm lazy? :p i'll go chek it out
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: lol what formulas are different, i only named one :P
<Dark_Horst> good boy
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: but yeah, yay physics ^^ so many engineers/physicits here
<MakerDusk> Shizuka: I've actually used more oper commands today than in the last few months >_<
<ehm> dat electromagnetism _-_
<Krakass> Magnets, how do they work?
<twilight_sprinkle> dats more simple electrostatics :3
<Magic> well see yall later everypony
<Aircrafter> Dat Album Name: Sexy Smooth
<foxinator> no idea how i closed the chat doing that :p
<MakerDusk> twilight_sprinkle: the network is littered with them ^_^
<Krakass> See ya Magic
<alexxm> cya Magic
<Aircrafter> Later Magic.
<MakerDusk> isn't it wonderful?
<foxinator> c u
<twilight_sprinkle> Krakass: the electrons in the body all have the same rotation directionand speed which allows their magnetic fields to add which creates a magentic field around the body
<pyrocatboy> Magic: C U
<Magic> bye
<LunaTheBeloved> Bye Magic
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: i wouldve thought theyd be busy working :D
<MakerDusk> taking over the world: step 1, global communications network check
<Krakass> twilight_sprinkle, so is that how friendship also works since Friendship is Magic?
<twilight_sprinkle> then again, im here :D
<foxinator> would there be like a mlp fim marathong close to the beginning of s3?
<foxinator> marathon*
<MakerDusk> step 2: recruit management
<MakerDusk> check
<Krakass> 3. ????????????
<alexxm> i guess so foxinator
<pablez94> gotta go 2 eat cul8r
<twilight_sprinkle> Krakass: i guess you could say that, idk
<alexxm> have fun pablez94
<Aircrafter> 3: Make sure there is Cake?
<foxinator> can't hardly wait alrdy
<Krakass> 4. Profit
<MakerDusk> step 3: intelligence gathering
<Aircrafter> Wow. No Mercy.
<twilight_sprinkle> that would be a lot of people to hire
<MakerDusk> http://ponychat.net/2012-04-21_map.html check
<twilight_sprinkle> it wouldnt be secret
<RankWinner> It doesn't have to be
<twilight_sprinkle> yah i saw that map
<foxinator> woow
<twilight_sprinkle> a severe lack of eastern russian ponies
<RankWinner> Tell the average person that you're making a team to take over the world and I doubt they'd take you seriously
<twilight_sprinkle> also no antarctica ponies
<MakerDusk> twilight_sprinkle: you saw a single set of data
<MakerDusk> we have much more ;)
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: Oo
<Krakass> MakerDusk, that's just based on ip geolocation right?
<foxinator> lot of german/belgian/ whathever is in my neighberhood
<alexxm> the hell happened here it looks like more of a hellhole then everywhere else
<MakerDusk> it is
<Krakass> So in all likelyhood I'm both people in my town then.
<MakerDusk> lol, I'm not even sure which set was posted in the end
<Aircrafter> Is Wrek just killign everyone that he comes across?
<Aircrafter> killing*
<drfsupercenter> 03Darn, I need to find someone in the San Antonio area that can record HDTV
<drfsupercenter> 03by Saturday
<MakerDusk> the network one, or the bronystate viewers one
<alexxm> what do you mean Krakass
<Krakass> alexxm, http://ponychat.net/2012-04-21_map.html
<MakerDusk> Krakass: all duplicates were removed
<pyrocatboy> 28
<pyrocatboy> BOOM HEADSHOT!
<MakerDusk> and since it tracks by IP, it puts the flags in the same places for people useing the same ISP
<twilight_sprinkle> a brony i nthe middle of the atlantic ocean :D
<ehm> Krakass, answering your rejoin question, on xchat type: /set irc_auto_rejoin on ...but channel mode +J prevents rejoining for 3 seconds
<MakerDusk> to get more accurate, we'd have to triangulate in on your position
<Krakass> Thanks for that answer ehm.
<MakerDusk> taking the equipment into account
<alexxm> ded
<twilight_sprinkle> we need some antartcica bronies, otherwise the haters will escape there once we take over
<Krakass> Wow, you guys did your homework.
<ehm> Krakass, to auto-rejoin with +J, you'd need a simple timer script.
<alexxm> don't worry twilight_sprinkle we'll nuke it if haters go there
<foxinator> great idea
<MakerDusk> well, I am a physicist
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: that would flood the world
<Dark_Horst> did you guys know that there's a battlefield 3 server in the antarctica?
<twilight_sprinkle> or at least raise water level
<foxinator> lol
<MakerDusk> me and a few of my buddies could probably whip something up ;)
<alexxm> what do you mean twilight_sprinkle
<foxinator> we bronies can handle some wtare
<foxinator> water*
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: if we nuke antarctica the ice will melt
<twilight_sprinkle> drowning and suffocating are the worst ways to die :(
<Aircrafter> Wouldn't they just die then anyway?
<Krakass> The last physicist I heard of doing their homework was wondering if a nuclear bomb would ignite the atmosphere...
<MakerDusk> twilight_sprinkle: rendering the atlantic impassable
<alexxm> sorry i thought you said alaska twilight_sprinkle
<foxinator> lol my little ponie
<twilight_sprinkle> MakerDusk: i just hope it doesnt crack and melt and kill everything
<MakerDusk> which would help us initially solidify our infrastructure
<Aircrafter> If they're in the middle of one of the most Inhospitable areas in the world....

<Dark_Horst> you know what would be a good idea? the gamer ss(schutzstaffel, in this case). they protect gamers from filthy subhuman cheater-scum and throw them in tutorial camps. there they have to play games on hardmode without cheating until their brains drip out of their noses and they die
<Bronysith> Wrek well if ur bored then yea w/e

<CriticKitten> Welp I'm gonna be fired at the end of the school year. Yay.
<MahBoi777> bye Anotherguy
*Ninjazz patrs CriticKitten on the back
<Sylandest> why is that, CriticKitten ?
<MahBoi777> that sucks.....or does it?
<CriticKitten> My district just voted to make major cuts in spending.
<CriticKitten> Among those cuts is the firing of 80 teachers.
<Sylandest> CriticKitten: ooh, that would do it
<Ninjazz> Dat economy.
<CriticKitten> And the closing of two schools.
<Ninjazz> Damn!
<HyperMetalLugia> Lols
<Digit|Skyrim> man that freaking sucks D:
*Sylandest hugs CriticKitten
<Sylandest> you'll find something
<CriticKitten> And firing every single teacher aide, and several janitors and special ed teachers
<OmegaMetroidBrony> DAyum
*pyrocatboy eats CriticKitten
<TheRainbowDash> (hugs CriticKitten):P
<CriticKitten> Oh, but we're still going to pay the superintendent FOURTY THOUSAND DOLLARS more than her predecessor
<Dark_Horst> Wrek be fucking shit up
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Yet I thought the gov't liked spending money?
*alexxm hugs CriticKitten
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/173987
<RX-78-SweetieBot> oh my
<TheRainbowDash> Dark_Horst: The Wrekonater....cool..:)
<Sparkle-Pone> Thank you TheRainbowDash! :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh DRF= http://i.imgur.com/PhBKH.png :D
<CriticKitten> So we're going to overpay her and just fire over a hundred people on staff instead. Makes sense right?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Then again the uneducated masses are easier to control
<TheRainbowDash> Sparkle-Pone: Sure, no problem...:)
<MahBoi777> so much sense
<Sylandest> CriticKitten: its never been said that governments make the best choices
*pyrocatboy eats Sparkle-Pone
<Sparkle-Pone> no good, I have too many holes to be filling
<CriticKitten> It's not governments, it's the school board for this district. Administrators will never vote to lower their own pay, they'll just fire teachers instead and keep raking in six figure incomes
<alexxm> wat Sparkle-Pone
<Wrek|Observing> 05soon done dear
<Sparkle-Pone> not sure
<DairyCannon> The Wreking continues :)
<CriticKitten> Anyways, oh well. So I found that out today from the teacher's aide for our math department, who is pretty much like "meh, I'm not even full time minimal wage anyways"
<MahBoi777> huzzah for destruction
<Dark_Horst> the wrek SEES!
<Dashie_Dashie> Here, have some music. http://youtu.be/o39VDFPTzow
<OmegaMetroidBrony> BoS = East caps
<TheRainbowDash> DairyCannon: I just sent the Wrekonater to the battlefield...after 30 minutes, see out victory.:)
<CriticKitten> (yeah, picture that, you can make as much as a teacher's aide as you can at McDonald's, go figure)
*pyrocatboy eats DairyCannon
<twilight_sprinkle> whats an in-house test? as in "in-house test about the addctiveness of tobacco"
<CriticKitten> (really shows how much we care about education)
<otakon> I'm back
<otakon> what's Wrek|Observing playing now?
<TheRainbowDash> Welcome back otakon! (waves)
<otakon> looks like Starcraft 2
<OmegaMetroidBrony> oh hai otakon
*pyrocatboy eats otakon
<otakon> hiya OmegaMetroidBrony
<Sylandest> CriticKitten: I'm sorry that you got the short end of the stick here. We support you, if it means anything! :)
<MahBoi777> hey otakon
<otakon> pyrocatboy: don't do that, I'm covered with pionous spines
<Rainboom_Crash> hello everypony
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03GG NO RE
<Wrek|Observing> 05Scoot-Scootaloo
<CriticKitten> Sylandest: "Officially" I'm not fired yet.
*pyrocatboy eats OmegaMetroidBrony
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03eeyup!
<DairyCannon> Hey pyrocatboy don't eat too many chatters or else you'll get a wicked bad tummy ache! Hehehe, SWAG.
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: you lose?
<Sylandest> CriticKitten: Irregardless, we still got your back
<OmegaMetroidBrony> One does not simply ingest an Omega Metroid
<CriticKitten> But I'm the only one in my department without a classroom of my own, and the only one without experience beyond this (my first year) so I'm by far the easiest to fire.
<lolol> Wrek|Observing: i think i know the answer to this, but can i play SC2 with you?
<CriticKitten> Oh, and wanna hear more awesome news about this?
<Sylandest> CriticKitten: might as well give us all of it. What else?
<TheRainbowDash> CriticKitten: Umm...sure, ok...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I could almost taste the sarcasm off of that sentence
<Digit|Skyrim> i tasted it too
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: what do you teacheth?
<pavarkian> delicious, eh
<CriticKitten> So our district has a required limit of 32 kids. Classes can't be bigger than that.
<TheRainbowDash> OmegaMetroidBrony: The fresh print of sarcasm on the print of words...:D
<CriticKitten> Which is already too large but I digress.
<CriticKitten> So with them firing so many teachers, they realized it'd be hard to make that mark.
<CriticKitten> So what are they gonna do? Why, they'll just get rid of class size restrictions of course!
<pavarkian> of course
<CriticKitten> Say hello to 40-kid classes!
<Sylandest> CriticKitten: Daaang
<pavarkian> I was in one of those once
<Digit|Skyrim> Damn!
<twilight_sprinkle> hello 40-kid class
<MahBoi777> DANG
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damn!
<TheRainbowDash> CriticKitten: Geez man...:O
<alexxm> serriously
<Sylandest> CriticKitten: That's just not right
<MahBoi777> that's an army
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot you hear from kenne and UnfoudBug today about a game tomorrow clearing Gold?
<MahBoi777> lol
<TheRainbowDash> You'll see kids as far back to their desks of a mile away...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I don't think any teacher that isn't strict as BUCK could handle that many kids
<alexxm> theres about 12 people in my college class
<MahBoi777> they're gonna rebel
<TheRainbowDash> It is too much for any teacher to experience through...
<alexxm> too much
<Digit|Skyrim> ofc they will MahBoi777
<CriticKitten> Yeah. It's not. But then I'm supposed to support the party that's doing this.
<Invi> I was once in a 38 kids class in the 5th school year
<OmegaMetroidBrony> My teachers can hardly handle the class sizes in my school.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> So many god damn "Class Clowns" in some
<TheRainbowDash> Ingwaz: The biggest sized class that I was in was maybe 25 and that's it...:)
<CriticKitten> Now if you want to do "lecture-sized classes" for high school, hey, go for it. But don't expect them to succeed when you're doing that.
<TheRainbowDash> And it wasn't even too bad either.
*pyrocatboy eats Ingwaz
<MahBoi777> most people we've ever had in a class is 10-15
*alexxm pokes pyrocatboy with a stick
<OmegaMetroidBrony> 30 plus is a nightmare
<Invi> wut? lol what a dream MahBoi777
*pyrocatboy eats the stick

<CCCP> Kammerjunk: it makes me soo happy that i dont have to make sense
<TheRainbowDash> Alright another question. What game that will be released this year feels like the biggest bust/waste of money to you?

<flutter_spin> :( I want to play Starcraft 2, but I'm more of a vs computer type of guy

<Chimera> [16:23:04] <GerbilSoft[derp]> now this could either mean one of two things:
<Chimera> [16:23:10] <GerbilSoft[derp]> 1. biden was quoting teddy roosevelt
<Chimera> [16:23:12] <GerbilSoft[derp]> 2. obama's black
<TheRainbowDash> Ok, another question. If you had only one game to play for the rest of your life, what will that be? (say maybe you're on a deserted island or something like that)
<Kammerjunk> MahBoi777: Yus wai!
<Litwick> Does anyoen want to play Kid icarus Uprising with me?
<pavarkian> skyrim

<MahBoi777> ball in a cup is better than paddleball
<pavarkian> mhmm
<pavarkian> ikr
<NightSeas> 2"the president has a big stick"
<NightSeas> 2that could be translated in quite a few ways :x
<drf|class> yay computers :P

<Magic> mlp mmo sounds fun
<MahBoi777> :D
<drf|class> also LOL

<Aurora> 6controller(s), cables, etc
<pavarkian> nice
<drf|class> basically everything
<drf|class> I literally
<Chimera> <GerbilSoft[derp]> “I promise you, the president has a big stick,” Biden said, “I promise you.”
<Chimera> <GerbilSoft[derp]> now this could either mean one of two things:
<Chimera> <GerbilSoft[derp]> 1. biden was quoting teddy roosevelt
<Chimera> <GerbilSoft[derp]> 2. obama's black
<Activate_The_pootis> You know what I would like? A haryr potter RPG made by bioware.
<drf|class> took it out of the box and hooked it up
<pavarkian> hmm
<pavarkian> thatd be cool
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Do you have a mic? ._.
<TheRainbowDash> Activate_The_pootis: That would be cool...:P
<flutter_spin> So I finally finished my fanfic in ... well, written expression form
<pyrocatboy> Kammerjunk: eeyup -watches Sputnik float by-

<pavarkian> spanning all secen books?
<flutter_spin> The ending is awesome, totally
<Kammerjunk> XAX: I have two. Why?
<Wrek|Observing> 05em girefers
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: hmmm... Probably tetris (no joke)

<pablez94> we're sorry tto twi! http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/174045
<TheRainbowDash> Ok, another question. What game was the biggest dissapointment to you?

<Yahooz> CCCP: inb4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhHAuMep748
<drf|class> I can part with it
<Kammerjunk> TheRainbowDash: Spore. I had hoped for much more.
<pavarkian> is that a good or bad thing
<Aurora> 6cool
<drf|class> like I said, I'm baiscally replacing that with an older model that can play PS2
<drf|class> the one I'm looking at on eBay
<drf|class> comes with a controller and remote
<Aurora> 6that'll work cuz I'm gonna have 3 gamers in one apartment next semester
<drf|class> so I could give away mine
<drf|class> XD
<Chimera> nice, Roara
<flutter_spin> I remember drifting off into my mind and thinking of the ponies visiting me in my bedroom. Then I realized that they wouldn't be wearing any clothes and.... then I freaked out and thought of something else
<drf|class> er not remote, nvm
<Chimera> speaking of games
<Kammerjunk> XAX: Oh, right. I don't actually get wasted on whiskey, I just get tipsy, maybe slightly drunk.
<CCCP> Yahooz: wut is this? :)
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Yahooz, you know no video links during a stream
<Chimera> tomorrow my school is having a part

<TheRainbowDash> Kammerjunk: Yeah, I meant to say Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 or something like that...
<pavarkian> makes more sesne
<Kammerjunk> >YFW Black Ops 2.
<XAX> CoD4: the only MW game that was made with PC players in mine at all.
<XAX> In mind*
<Magic> ah call of duty
<Kammerjunk> The stone, it calls to me, and now I see the things the stone has shown to me: A rock that spoke a word (An animated mineral, it can be heard).
<CCCP> I think Lyra broke up with Bon Bon
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ?
<MahBoi777> Call of Duty is okay
<TheRainbowDash> Ok, another question. What is the first game that you played?
<Midnight_Tempest> CoD, the only FPS game that i would buy to only throw the disk into A BLENDER
<pablez94> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/174037
*pavarkian is watching animaniacs
<flutter_spin> Starcontrol 2
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: wow, really?
<Yahooz> TheRainbowDash: Super Mario World 3 ofc
<FillyFlam> Super Mario 64.
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: i hate that game that much, yes
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Super Smash Bros
<CountDoofus> First game? Hmmm... Either Tetris or Super Mario Land (Game Boy)
<Yahooz> for the GB advance
<CCCP> COD is soo over rated it has be come under rated. Seriously its NOT THAT BAD
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: before it became annual I like it
<Midnight_Tempest> StarControl 2 is the greatest game ever made
<MahBoi777> I like Battlefield and Halo
<otakon> CCCP: agreed, it's just bc it comes out every damn year
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Midnight_Tempest, wouldn't setting fire to your wallet essentially accomplish the same thing?
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: After CoD 3, it just went oatmeal. Seriously, who brings a crossbow to a war?
<Magic> metal gear
<pavarkian> I as well MahBoi777
<flutter_spin> ^^ I know you love it Midnight
<TheRainbowDash> For me, it would have to be Sonic from the Sega Genesis. (or some form of that)
<Midnight_Tempest> kirzstryfe: true, and i wouldn't have to say i bought CoD
<otakon> Kammerjunk: Rambo
<CCCP> otakon: i will agree it is getting old
<Aurora> 6hahah this works out. my parents were gonna get one for my birthday I think, but now I can have them buy the games while I get a cheaper PS3
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: i would
<otakon> CCCP: it's becoming the new Madden
<FillyFlam> Anyone going to war before like 1400.
<XAX> One of the things that made COD bad in the first place was the fan base :l The other thing of course, was the fact they bring one out every year.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dat 37 gold bar feeling
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Allow me to rephrase: Who brings a crossbow to a war and isn't Arnold Schwarzenegger?
<CCCP> otakon: i know what u mean
<pavarkian> yearly releases of a shooter really doesnt work...
<FillyFlam> And after like...god knows when.
<otakon> XAX: Halo MP players are worse in general
<pavarkian> LIES
<Aurora> 6plus the main game I want and can start out with, it's pretty dang cheap so yep
<pavarkian> says the fan boy
<pablez94> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/174015
<otakon> XAX: damn twitchy little kids foul mouth bastards
<LonelyPony> XAX: I agree completely, the fanbase is filled with utter retards
<Kammerjunk> New CoD games aren't about war, it's about appealing to the general teenager.
<flutter_spin> Extra Creditz new video is "Harassment" and they really touch on Xbox Live badmouthing
<Aurora> 6we can discuss payment tonight, I'm pretty sure this will work out
<LonelyPony> Unlike The MLP: FIP Fanbase :D
<otakon> flutter_spin: I should watch it
<pablez94> WTF?!?!?!?http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/174015
<drf|class> I think mine has a 80GB hard drive for what that's worth
<drf|class> OK
<Wrek|Observing> 05finally it goes well
<MahBoi777> pavarkian: lol, not all of them are, but there are a few
<Aurora> 6oh that's plenty fine
<pavarkian> ah
<LonelyPony> fip? lol fim*
<pavarkian> true
<XAX> otakon: I don't own any "current gen" consoles. I am safe from IQ-draining 12 year olds. Huzzah!
<drf|class> I can prolly go home this weekend and get it, since nobody else uses it LOL
<Aurora> 6I wouldn't need one of those ridiculously big ones
<Aurora> 6kk
<drf|class> I still can't convince my sisters to stop using the DVD playert
<drf|class> -t
<pavarkian> hmm
<drf|class> even though we have an HDTV
<drf|class> so whatever XD
<TheRainbowDash> And final question.....what was your views on the show My Little Pony before you became a brony, and when did you become a brony?
<Aurora> 6yeah no rush to send it, I want it before summer but I wont be able to play much until then due to final projects
<TheRainbowDash> (talking about Friendship is Magic)
<drf|class> well, I dunno how much longer this guy is going to have the first-gen one for sale so the sooner the better LOL (though obviously I can just buy that one first)
<Sumica> 00,10so this is a twist on the zombie map
<XAX> I take back my previous statement. I DO own CSS. that has enough little kids on it to make one rip thy hair out :l
<flutter_spin> Season 2 Episode 4 went live, but I started watching from the first episode onward
<Kammerjunk> TheRainbowDash: Nothing at all. I wasn't even one of the "neutrals" on the pony threads, I just scrolled past it.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nothing really. I just kinda wandered in to it.
<pavarkian> I liked it, but I hadnt seen it... and I became a brony truly, when I came upon bronystate >_>
<pyrocatboy> TheRainbowDash: Yu-Gi-Oh: meh. And around July.
<Aurora> 6no I mean, I'll pay you tonight
<CountDoofus> Pretty much the same as everyone else, no? "MLP? Seriously? That's for little girls!" But the more good things I heard about it, the more intrigued I got, and figured, eh what the hell.
<drf|class> oh
<drf|class> cool
<Aurora> 6you don't need to send it immediately if you don't want
<drf|class> well it's at my house
<drf|class> and I'm here LOL
<Aurora> 6well then
<flutter_spin> Anything that has me engaged, where the lines of mere educational or entertainment ends, has my attention
<Aurora> 6send it :'D
<drf|class> But ideally like, Monday
<Aurora> 6thats fine
<drf|class> is when I could send it
<Magic> well i watched all the episodes
<Bronysith> CountDoofus i just watched hotdiggedydemons .mov and i became intrigued
<MahBoi777> TheRainbowDash: lol, I didn't really have an opinion on the show or the people that watched it, became one in September
<FillyFlam> I didn't really give it much thought, but I figured I might like it if I tried it. And it was in like...November of last year. Just before Sisterhooves Social, I think.
<drf|class> I gotta talk to my mom about coming home, but I haven't gone home since Easter so she won't care
<drf|class> god, the only bad thing about having a Friday night radio show]
<drf|class> is I can't leave before like 10
<drf|class> :/
<pyrocatboy> I jumped straight in.
<Magic> but didnt know bout bonys
<flutter_spin> When Fluttershy didn't make the jump in "Dragonshy", I actually jumped out of my seat to try and catch her saying "NO!!"
<XAX> TheRainbowDash: I try to have a neutral opinion on EVERYTHING before I try it myself, so before I watched the show, and someone told me about bronies, I just thought "Meh they can do what they want :l"
<flutter_spin> ...yeah... that kind of show
<pavarkian> I was introduced to it by one of my friends...
<CCCP> Is love in bloom?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> damn equestria10 does not work anymore for welovefine
<Magic> until a couple of vids pointed it to me
<CountDoofus> Odd thing is, I've never seen anything MLP related until I started watching it. Suddenly after that, I can't find anything that ISN'T related somehow.
<CCCP> ^
<pyrocatboy> My first encounter was hearing of The Stare.
<Magic> true
<pavarkian> I probably never would've watched MLP if I hadn't been friends with certain people
<Magic> lol
<CCCP> Actually thats not 100% true 4 me
<flutter_spin> Oddly enough, it was about the same time I saw the Teens React video.
<Kammerjunk> CountDoofus: My family got a new TV once. We then noticed just how many TVs were shown on TV.
<flutter_spin> I said "eh, I'm not doing anything else"
<deadeagle> SWEET SC2!
<Very_Silly_Filly> eh, as in Canadian? :P
<MahBoi777> I converted my friend, and he found bronystate and showed me it
<pavarkian> hmm
<flutter_spin> eh as in "uneven scale hand animation"
<CountDoofus> TV-ception?
<NightSeas> 2well, atleast it's not a midnight show
<CCCP> I first heard of it when i was on a website and every one had pony avatars and i thought it looked really stupid.
<flutter_spin> or the famous "two hands upside in the air"
<pablez94> THAT MAY GET TWI AND AJ FANS UPSET DON'T WATCH IF U ARE http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/173990
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's my own fault I',m brony
<drf|class> they don't have them that late
<Very_Silly_Filly> I heard sandviches song
<deadeagle> SCREW ROTMG IM WATCHING THIS
<NightSeas> 2ah
<drf|class> I think the latest ends at 11
<Very_Silly_Filly> I wanted to know the original
<drf|class> I took the 7-9 slot
<Very_Silly_Filly> My face: Dear god.
<Kammerjunk> It wasn't even the enormous fanbase, nor what it produced or the rate it did such, that dragged me into the show. It was chance, really.
<drf|class> there was like a 10-11 and from 6-10 was open
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: tell u moar
<drf|class> so I was a total jerk and took the middle so anybody else who wanted a 2 hour show is SOL :D
*drf|class runs
<drf|class> nah that's not hwy
<CCCP> us*
<drf|class> *why
<pablez94> hilarious :http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/173990

<Kammerjunk> CCCP: u wot m8
<MahBoi777> CCCP: and yet here you are, lol no regrets
<XAX> What dragged me into the show was some rand on my steam friends list :l
<NightSeas> 2XD
<drf|class> I just figure 7PM is a good starting time, so I can eat dinner first
<drf|class> as bah no food or drink allowed in the booth
<Magic> i started with the dark version
<Magic> magic mov

<MahBoi777> *sniff* not bad indeed
<kirzstryfe> 1,3CCCP: live or dead?
<CCCP> lol dead
<otakon> I've got a fair bit of PSN cash atm just going to waste

<CCCP> It was really sad
<alexxm> i just feel odd about pony r34 cause you know they are horses pablez94
<CCCP> idk why any one would want to
<MahBoi777> me neither
<deadeagle> nuuuuu
<Cobellanez> Mineralz looks different then i remember
<CCCP> I can still smell the fucking formaldehyde
<otakon> Also, Fluttershy in a style reminescent of Tetsuya Nomura
<BronyJenkins> Oh. It's getting late. I'll be back in the middle of the night. G'Night for now.

<CCCP> ohai Saturn
<MahBoi777> hey Saturn
<pablez94> alexxm: we even know that's it's IMPOSSIBLE to get into equestria but we still try to go into it
<Saturn> 08,01i'm being all diligent and Getting Shit Done
<Saturn> 08,01(for one)
<flutter_spin> oh hey otakon. P3 was good, but it was very emo. Yes, FES is a good version
<Saturn> 08,01*once
<alexxm> hey Saturn what you been to
<Cobellanez> Good for you Saturn
<pavarkian> hmm
<pavarkian> I thought things seemed strange Saturn
<RaveBrony> Woah, i leave for a bit and then a wild Saturn appears! O_O
<otakon> flutter_spin: it's THE version to get, and 10 for a direct download is WAY cheaper then a used copy is
<MahBoi777> lol
<pablez94> btw please borrow me a bit of grammar, alexxm
<flutter_spin> otakon.... whichever version that allows you to be a girl. I always wanted to try that version
<otakon> flutter_spin: PSP
<alexxm> so RaveBrony any updates on if ponysquares working RaveBrony
<otakon> flutter_spin: well, you can play as [SPOILER] in The Answer
<alexxm> sorry for double ping
<alexxm> sorry pablez94
<RaveBrony> alexxm: Its fine, it only pings once :) and uhh...i dont remember my log on :D
<pavarkian> oh, as spoiler, cool
<pablez94> alexxm: ?
<flutter_spin> Well I never really finished P3. I never got around to it. $10 is $10, but it would be hard for me to return to the game.
<RankWinner> Just for the record, http://derpy.me/Wn0mA eye colour is quite close to red
<ehm> pavarkian, yes, Bill Clinton played sax in middle school band and famously played it on the Arsenio Hall late-night talk/comedy show in 1992.
<ryaxnb_> celestia is awesome
*RankWinner just realised chat was scrolled up.
<alexxm> yea i get this message when i try to log in RaveBrony Cannot connect to the database: Too many connections
<otakon> flutter_spin: well, I already have P4(got it on sale brand new for 8 bucks! what a DEAL!)
<ryaxnb_> best ideal monarchy character
<ryaxnb_> thank you hasbro for forcing her into the show
<pavarkian> mmk ehm
<RaveBrony> alexxm: Maybe its under attack :(
<ryaxnb_> leading good writers to work hard to make an illogical character type work :)
<otakon> flutter_spin: I had P3 for awhile, then I traded it in when money was tight. Was hoping to get it again.
<RaveBrony> give it time....
<RaveBrony> :\
<Digit|Skyrim> NUUUUUUUU!!
*Digit|Skyrim flips over table
<ehm> pavarkian: Also, Nathan Rugger, voice of Skippy Squirrel and Baby Plucky, was the one to suggest adding that lyric to the theme song.
<flutter_spin> yeah, its hard for me to decide. I just borrow from my cousins
<alexxm> i know just checking if anyone else got that RaveBrony
<pavarkian> hmm ehm

<RaveBrony> Arent Alicorns immortal and stuffs?
<pavarkian> yeah RaveBrony
<kirzstryfe> 1,3RaveBrony, the alicorn = immortal thing is fanon, they've never said in the show that all alicorns are immortal
<Light_Latias> 12bbl foods
<flutter_spin> ^
<iammrcrap> alexxm good, we're taking SATS this week so I get off school early
<RaveBrony> But Celestia is in Granny Smith's filly flashback :o
<pablez94> dunno why but i really like this pic:http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/173498
<Cobellanez> So?
<WallMaster> long aged isnt immortal...
<flutter_spin> Well, it COULD be they live a long time
<Dken2021> they never said it though
<alexxm> hope it goes well for you iammrcrap
<Cobellanez> Celestia is older than Granny Smith
<pavarkian> so, how is it that celestia and luna have lived for thousands of years?
<RaveBrony> Celestia must use ALOT of beauty products :D
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Celestia and Luna are immortal, but not -all- alicorns are explicitly immortal
<flutter_spin> Or at the very least... elf-like
<pablez94> omfg crashing message!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3being an alicorn could be a genetic mutation, like albinoism
<pablez94> sorry
<pavarkian> mhmm
<LunaTheBeloved> Not much activity in here tonight?
<GLaDOS> lol
<RaveBrony> kirzstryfe: Ooooh, ty for clarifying :) But Faust is also immortal too :3
<pablez94> dunno why but i like this pic : http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/173498
<Dken2021> sometimes I hate when fanon tries to be canon, really confusing
<RX-78-SweetieBot> not really
<flutter_spin> Then again, Faust was surprised they made Cadance as an alicorn
<RX-78-SweetieBot> was dead most of yesterday too
<pavarkian> thats nice Dken2021
<LunaTheBeloved> Hmmmm...
*LunaTheBeloved pies everypony in here

<RaveBrony> flutter_spin: Really? :o
<CCCP> One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, rock
<GLaDOS> They probably made her an alicorn to go with the action, at times she needs to fly and at times she needs to use magic.
<flutter_spin> yeah, I can pull up the link here in a moment
<RaveBrony> Faust ws dissapoint or just surprised?
<RaveBrony> *was
<pavarkian> both?

<NightSeas|Art> 02Angel*
<CCCP> otakon: already did formaldehyde sucks too much to go away
<otakon> kenne: odl
<RAWRity> As far as Lauren Faust leaving as executive producer, it was because she couldn't handle the workload of running the show full time, and she was burning out.

<PwNIES> Hello
<Cobellanez> Hey Biglaw
<RaveBrony> Hey Biglaw :)
<WallMaster> hi Biglaw.
<Ingwaz> Mr-Dismo: its not rude, all he asked was when would someone else stream. if he doesnt feel like watching a game that wrek is playing, its a legitimate question
<Dken2021> lali-ho Biglaw
<alexxm> hey Biglaw hows your day been
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm just got out of my self imposed-exile (not really, i was asleep and i needed some sleep) LOL how you've been
<pony_6558> starcraft..... i haven't played that game in ages
<alexxm> good Dark92Enigma
<Dken2021> oh nighty night pablez94, take care
<PwNIES> I wonder how is this match gonna turn out :D
<alexxm> cya pablez94
<flutter_spin> well, Starcraft 2 has only been out here recently

<LunaTheBeloved> heheh
<PwNIES> Recently
<PwNIES> In just 2-3 years
<pablez94> bye bye
<alexxm> cya pablez94
<PrincessDismo> Ingwaz: That IS rude, How do you think someone feels when they hear that, Grow up. He can pause the stream and go watch other stuff. No excuse. It's plain rude.
<CCCP> idk y sum people dont like 4chan http://derpy.me/VPxbi
<PwNIES> :I
<PwNIES> omg
<CCCP> bye pablez94
<PwNIES> that was an easy win
<Biglaw> Days been good
<Dken2021> CCCP lol
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm what were we talking about? OH yeah, what if HBK Shawn Michaels would've been a pony.....
<CCCP> :)
<Ingwaz> PrincessDismo: it would have been rude had he worded it rudely, he only asked when someone else would be streaming
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
*pablez94 licks alexxm at least as much as he can in da 8 hours he satyed online
*CCCP hugs Dken2021
<Ingwaz> its not different then asking when a different show would be on
*Dken2021 hugs back
<otakon> STOP TALKING WE CAN HEAR YOU FROM THE SHADOWS!
<Biglaw> So what should I draw everypony?
<Calcos323> Hey everypony!
<otakon> Biglaw: Gummy
<otakon> hello Calcos323, Ingwaz, Biglaw, Dken2021
<Ingwaz> PrincessDismo: and telling me to grow up when i have done nothing to attack you, insult you, belittle you or anything of that sort is rude
<alexxm> hey Calcos323 hows your day been
<Biglaw> otakon okie dokie lokie
<PwNIES> You should really scout dude
<Dark92Enigma> the chat failed......yet again.
<Dken2021> Biglaw ever had a crack at a final fantasy character? specifically cecil harvey?
<pablez94> LOVE YA ALL BRONIES. cu 2morrow.
<pyrocatboy> Biglaw: Pirate Queen Celestia!
<CCCP> :)
<Calcos323> alexxm: Very good, just got mah paycheck
<Dken2021> ohai otakon
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Biglaw: Pit from Kid Icarus as a pony
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm you're still there
<alexxm> yea Dark92Enigma
<Biglaw> I am drawing gummy :)
<PrincessDismo> Ingwaz: And it's rude. Nomatter HOW it's put it's rude, He does NOT need to say that at all. Wrek is streaming and whe he's done he's done, You don't need to ask that. Nobody is forcing him to stream.
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm we were talikng about HBK being a pony
<alexxm> yea Dark92Enigma
<PwNIES> Anyone here doesn't play starcraft?
<Dken2021> hbk?
<Ingwaz> PrincessDismo: there is nothing wrong with just asking when to expect someone else to stream, he didnt even say that he didnt like wrek's stream. you're just jumping to conclusions without knowing his reasoning
<Calcos323> I don't play Starcraft. I suck at it
<alexxm> i don't PwNIES
<WallMaster> I dont play starcraft.
*OmegaMetroidBrony doesn't play StarCraft
*RaveBrony has never played starcraft >.>
<PwNIES> ic
<PwNIES> lol
<flutter_spin> My bro and I played Starcraft 2 for a good 6 months
<Dark92Enigma> Dken2021 SHort for Heart Break Kid
<pyrocatboy> PwNIES: I don't
<alexxm> shawn micheals Dken2021
<flutter_spin> We got really good, but we both hated pvp
<PwNIES> lol that drop
<PwNIES> wait
<Calcos323> PYLONS
<deadeagle> fail drop?
<Dken2021> oh the wrestler..
<PwNIES> Was it a drop?
<Cobellanez> I downloaded a pack of pony socks but ITS NOT A CHALLEN GE when everyone uses mono :s
<Cobellanez> songs
<PrincessDismo> Ingwaz: He made a link, Someone told him not to, then he asked. That's what I seen, I'm walking away now, If it were SuperBrony64 streaming and he had linked and asked that I would be making a huge scene unless I were banned. So let's count our blessings and agree to disagree.
<Cobellanez> SONGS not socks
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm OK we got the hat, we got the front legwarmers, do we need pants?
<Cobellanez> Although
<PwNIES> dude scout with 1 or 2 probes
<deadeagle> pwnies: probably i dont really think they can get there otherwise
<Cobellanez> Downloading pony socks wouldn't be too bad
<alexxm> probable Dark92Enigma
<PwNIES> He probably on 4 base now
<PwNIES> with tanks
<flutter_spin> I think he is working his fingers off trying to keep up with the expansion
<PwNIES> research blink -.-
<PwNIES> continue ur upgrades
<deadeagle> blink stalkers
<flutter_spin> build a mothership! :P
<PwNIES> :I
<PwNIES> I highly recommended getting some robo units
<ScootaChicken> Good evening fillies and gentlecolts.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Evening ScootaChicken

<Dark92Enigma> OK alexxm what color? Cause if it's DX, then the legwarmers would be green, the pants would be black with the green DX symbol.....what would be his regular outfit color?
<flutter_spin> yeah, this isn't going to go well
*WallMaster shrugs
<Dken2021> O U
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Ridley

*otakon pats ScootaChicken on the head
<Dark92Enigma> Dken2021 : This was for yesterday, Squarepants
<ScootaChicken> Although I think Trixie likes short things, given that she's in a relationship with Meanwhile.
<ScootaChicken> I'm awful...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :D
<otakon> ScootaChicken: yeah, he is a short bugger
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Pfff
