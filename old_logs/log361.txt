<Ghosties> 04Dear Viewers:
<Ghosties> 04We have come to the decision of making a test, or experiment, if you may, this week regarding our chat configuration. The test consists of keeping the so-called 'Mane 6' rooms closed for streams outside of the live episodes as well as other special events. Our reasoning for such an action is all for the sake of better moderation, in order to bring you a more pleasant stream interaction

In other words, as the main BronyState Channel would be the hub for discussion in these occasions, the discussion could be better organized and kept free of trolls or other unsavory elements. However, we've heard complaints about this system, which is why we would like to hear your opinions regarding it. We assure you that this decision is merely in an experimental phase at the

<McScootaloo> 00,03Mare-A-Thon starts at 6:00 am EST!
<ThefunhasbeenDOUBLED> Please
<Meanwhile> I was drunk in public at 15. You guys are weird.
<Shadowmere> oh yeah!
<ThefunhasbeenDOUBLED> No dubstep...
<Robi> STAAAAOOOORT PREASH NAO thx
<Lucid> I just have no desire to do much drinking. Besides, my parents would skin me alive if I did. Especially my dad
<SadieMeowsalot> How are you all at present ?
<otakon> StinkomanFan: I don't think I've ever HEARD Prince before
<Swifty> Well i'm stupid, my headphones were unplugge
<McScootaloo> 00,03Ninja'd -_-
<FireLight> ...the hay is with that poster art?
<SpikeIsBestPony> Isn't there movie night tonight?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i had a bass, but i dropped it
<K_A> That's pretty hardcore. I don't know too many kids who get up that early.
*Big_Jakeintosh is 27 drinks constantly
<Lucid> Same here BronyKing
<IshBestPony> Question for Luna, how long until I can vote for A movies again, and can I still vote for B movies and ponysodes?
<DocSane> Got a new PC case that looks like stereo equipment.
<Simon2> lol
<Swifty> OH PLEASE DUBSTEP PLASE
<LordCelestia> 0,5Tovler: Got a problem with young mods?
<isegrim> i just found out that the mare-a-ton starts at the same time as the ACTA protests in germany
<otakon> HEY!
<K_A> I'll get on as soon as I can.
<mario_pony> hey Ghosties my favorite color is red so you'r my favorite!
<Tovler> Being Drunk is bother overrated and underrated.
<Midnight_Fire> but does it end at 10:00 for HaHD?
<Rainbowjack> WHAT hay is Ghost doing here
<otakon> I ahve a concern!
<Monkey_Zombie> ONLY 12 HOURS TO GO!
<FireLight> when does the new episode air?
<pony_8454> Being from Europe... that's in just under 9 hours, right?
*Big_Jakeintosh also not ashamed of it
<Meanwhile> Lucid: funny that, my dad was smoking weed not 3 hours ago.
<BronyKing> im not alone yay
<Dermathil> Tovler: I have been pushing for Apocalypse Now and Cube since the first lottery.
<prince-dari> Meanwhile: Yeah, but we're from the UK.
<pony117> wht times the movie?
<LordCelestia> 0,5I'm completely silly when i want to be, but completely serious when I need to be.
<Dermathil> hey dari
<Ghosties> 04I'm so glad I could be your favorite color, lol
<prince-dari> So. You know.
<OhioBronyShow> My shiow's fanon was destroyed...
<Meanwhile> dari I know but come on!
<StinkomanFan> I'm staying up all night. Just to see if this place ever dies before the ponies
<DeadlyDerp3> We must start, TALLY HOO!
<Dashie> o god the chat is dead for me again *braces for sudden flood of messages any minute now*
<richfiles> My opinion on the chat ISSUES are clearly known already... This is pure insanity. It's impossible to follow the movie AND a chat that is this INSANE at the same time. It ELIMIANTES any reason to even COME here for brony movie night
<otakon> IF MANECHAT IS CLOSED TOMORROW, HOW WILL POST SHOW GO DOWN?
<ScootaChicken> If I didn't completely fail the interview I would have been the youngest mod here
<Tovler> LordCelestia: Indeed. You're not mature until you're 25.
<Big_Jakeintosh> What can i say I LOVE beer
<ScootaChicken> but I did.
<Spazturtle> Who has seen the next movie
<prince-dari> Hey Derm, gratz on the pony ep.
<pikorar> My favorite color is rainbow.
<prince-dari> :P
<K_A> So what got the mods to change their minds? I thought they were originally just doing the new ep.
<ScootaChicken> so yarp.
<DSNesmith> it doesn't, StinkomanFan
<IngloriousPony89> 6:00?! Christ, man! No way I'm getting up that early!
<DSNesmith> I did that once
<Meanwhile> Also dari, you stole my Gondor line.
<DSNesmith> it wasn't fun
<DocSane> Which fanon? This show blows up fanon on a weekly basis.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> StinkomanFan: i'm with you !
<Tovler> Dermathil: Ok, I must've thinking of someone else.
<rem-dog> I have seen it
<Dermathil> LC: but what happens if you want to be silly while you need to be serious?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not even for ponies?
<LordCelestia> 0,5It works out.
<B0X0R> thats 5:00 for me
<pony117> Twi told derpy too?!??
<Shadowmere> is the next movie called Top Secret or do they just dont want is knowing what it is
<Meanwhile> Then you be real quiet.
<otakon> IngloriousPony89: but you MUST! you must, you MUST!
<IshBestPony> How long do I have to wait before I can vote for A's again, and can I still vote for B's and Ponies?
<ThefunhasbeenDOUBLED> Can the mods please open up the other rooms...?
<StinkomanFan> I need to work on my fanfic anyway
<McScootaloo> 00,03My favorite color is Gardevoir!
<DSNesmith> I pulled a 36-hour day for the season 2 premiere
<DSNesmith> worth it

<SayWhat> Just watched the top secret preview, it blew my mind
<Nicool2cool> dont saly thiat i have to get up at 5
<prince-dari> :P
<IngloriousPony89> No way. My sleep schedule must not be tampered with!
<Nicool2cool> in the mornig
<pony_7359> this is better
<Stormpony> What? Chat will be shut off during Pony live streams? But that's the best thing about Bronystreaming is the commentary/reactions. :(
<DeadlyDerp3> It's Called Top Secret :P
<GabeMoist> My favorite color is ponies
<Simon2> Gold & orange here
<LordCelestia> 0,5Silly filly; i wouldnt be here if I was too silly ^_^
<ScootaChicken> LordCelestia: I can never tell with you
<brusselsprout> Oh thank Celestia, it's slowed down a little...
<Lucid> My favorite color is bacon

<pony_7359> Xatu is best pokemon
<ScootaChicken> a bacon flavoured enigma
<pikorar> My favorite color is invisible.
<K_A> I always go on #bronystate, personally. I see it as the central hub for conversing, instead of breaking it up based on favorite pony.
<McScootaloo> 00,03Yes, the pokemon.
<DocSane> Top Secret was even better than Airplane
<[SWAG]thehated5689> ha... mane chat
<Tigereye> what's the delay on the movie tonight
<pony_8454> Stream it straight into our dreams...
<MistarFish> Gardevoir is second best pokemon next to wailmur
<Dermathil> Any idea whether there'll be any auditions soon?
<Goldenbreeze> My favorite color is clear
<Lucid> Bacon <3
<Nicool2cool> PLAY
<mario_pony> i have to wake up at 7am yaay~
<otakon> isn't it more trouble to do announcements on EVERY channel tomorrow fro everything?
<ThefunhasbeenDOUBLED> My mind is full of chat:P
<Tovler> it's odd knowing people who think Jackie Chan adventures is nostalgia
<Nicool2cool> I WANT MOVIES

<LunaTheBeloved> Anything in the 90's and late 80's is nostalgia for me
<Defcon> grey is the only color worthy of my favortism!
<otakon> think about that
<FireLight> buizel my favorite
<Lucid> I should totally be a mod. I would be best mod ever. Just sayin'
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i prefer bronystate chat over mane6 rooms, but its a bit harder to keep up with chat now
<Kammerjunk> Nothing is nostalgia for me.
<OhioBronyShow> So, what I miss when I was gone?
<SayWhat> The first shiny pokemon i ever saw was a raticate
<By-tor> Twilight uses Hug & Tolerate
<otakon> ANIMANIACS is 19 YEARS OLD
