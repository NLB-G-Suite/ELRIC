<Radagast> :8
<Rohan> That's a hueg fish.
<Applejack> it's del lago
<General_Hazard> Huh, I don't remember him sounding so squeaky as a halfling
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when a halfling was drowning?
<Purple`Prose> That's one hell ofa fish, mate
<Dat_Pon-3> wait thats gollum?
<GabeMoist> Fish of Sauron
<Rohan> SUDDENLY RING
<LunaTheForgotton> SHINY......
<ThunderDash> Where was Gondor when the ring was found again
<ThePretender> DAT FACE
<lordpie> hi guys
<Gollum> 11One's Gollum/Smeagol, the other is a random hobbit.
<Aragorn> 8o hai radiance
<CriticKitten> Well at least I almost died with a shiny object in my grasp.
<Turtaguin> hi
<Radagast> So... shiny... MUST KILL!!
<Arwen> Where's radiance?
<Aponymous> I lose fish, but I FINDS A SHINY!
<Meanwhile> Dem ears.
<fluttershy> ew
<GLaDOS> Does anyone think it would be cool if this guy became gollum instead of Smeagol?
<lordpie> lol
<Smeagol> 6One's Gollum/Smeagol, the other is Deagol.
<Blazanax> Looks like shit.
<Elky> what became of the dwarves' rings?
<Aragorn> 8shes here, arwen
<Nittany_Tiger> It's a golden band thingy.
<crono_flash> Random Trivia: The opening scene - in which Smeagol discovers the Ring and starts on the slippery slope towards ultimately becoming Gollum - was actually directed by Fran Walsh. Originally it was set to appear in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, immediately after Frodo first revealed Gollum's real name.
<Spazturtle> Where was gondor when Smeagol killed his brother?
<LunaTheForgotton> Shiny...
<Fish_of_Sauron> I started everything
<Rezo> inb4hobbitviolence
<Aragorn> 8i see all :)
<Arwen> Ohh fun

<GLaDOS> Fish_of_Sauron Oh dear.

<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when midgets were fighting?
<Fish_of_Sauron> POKE HIS EYES OUT
<Applejack> They lack the element of loyalty...
<Blazanax> Rough sex.
<Rohan> OH GOD NOT THE EYE GOUGE ATACK
<Sirius_Black> 10not bad shadowlurker, you?
<McKay> *wave* Hello everypony!
<LunaTheForgotton> spoiler:thats Gollum
<CriticKitten> Man, this is intense.
<scooot> this doesnt make any sense. Hobbits are resistant to the ring's power
<Elky> well, certainly better than just tossing it into a stream
<Dat_Pon-3> i really don't get what this ring actually does whats its purpose
<ThePretender> Sirius_Black? COMBO BREAKER
<ThunderDash> ring is shiny, therefore it is worth killing people for
<ThunderDash> LOGIC.
<The_Si> Suplex him
<shadowLurker> my internet seems slow...
<LunaTheForgotton> Hate detected
<Vinesnap_The_Ram> there's no way this is going to end well.
<Mazoot> thats why you should use lube
<GLaDOS> thump
<General_Hazard> Rapidly press Square!
<GLaDOS> thump
<DuskShine> Smeagol is probably very weak willed.
<GLaDOS> thump
<sotha> Ring used Frenzy on humanoids. It was super effective.
<ThunderDash> PRESS X TO NOT DIE
<Applejack> :C
<CriticKitten> It is the beating of his hideous heart!!!
<shadowLurker> lagy as hell
<Rohan> THERE IS NO SQUARE BUTTON ON THE KEYBOARD
<LunaTheForgotton> Fire the friendship cannon.
<General_Hazard> *cue God of War theme*
<CopperCogs> They aren't quite hobbits
<GLaDOS> PRESS X DAMMIT
<fluttershy> just killed his best bud.
<Aragorn> 8clearly smeagol isnt the element of loyalty
<Darf14> are we watching the movie on a different stream?
<Dark_Horst> nope. not laggy
<CopperCogs> they're something in between
<Nittany_Tiger> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
<desertman2> There's []

<Darf14> Thanks :)
<DoctorDoom> is this the extended version?
<MeteorVenture> that's addiction folks
<Arwen> Mr. Black, why so Sirius?
<GLaDOS> Question: Who among the Mane Six sould be most likely to fall under the Ring's influence?
<LunaTheForgotton> Totally worth it
<Rohan> PREEECIOUUUS
<Galadriel> 7yes it is
<Sirius_Black> 10Y U DO DIS ;____;
<ThePretender> Rarity
<DoctorDoom> awwwww yeaaaaaahhhhhh
<HaysforPonies> Oh hey, just a few minutes in.
<Rohan> D:
<Pegacorn> Totally Rarity.
<adamater> rainbow dash
<LunaTheForgotton> Dat ring
<DuskShine> Rarity, definitely.
<Elky> Twilight, definitely
<Rohan> GOOOLLLUUMM
<sotha> GLaDOS: Rarity
<Arwen> I need to be cleaning my room...
<ThunderDash> Rarity
<Ham993> Twilight Sparkle
<Spazturtle> GLaDOS Apple Jack
<sotha> Or maybe Twilight
<GLaDOS> I would say Rarity
<Blazanax> Oh shit, headphone-rape.
<CriticKitten> Yeah, why did they distrust me? I only killed a guy. ;-;
<The_Si> Poor bastard.
<HaysforPonies> I just finished laundry.
<Sirius_Black> 10also >go to type shift-w, press ctrl-w and kill page
<LunaTheForgotton> Rarity in 5 years
<Elky> Twilight would think she'd do the right thing with it
<fluttershy> :S
<PrincessCelestia> noo!
<Pegacorn> OHGOD
<Aponymous> Fluttershy. >_>
<GLaDOS> How about the least likely to?
<HaysforPonies> Fishie om nom
<Fish_of_Sauron> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Radagast> Or Fluttershy
<DuskShine> Pinkie Pie would probably be the one least affected by it, though.
<Rohan> CATFISH
<Rohan> D:
<Meanwhile> Someone give that man a toothbrush
<Elky> and slowly start using it for evil
<Applejack> Fluttershy???
<Pegacorn> WTF
<Applejack> nooo!!

<Rohan> WHAT IS THE SUN?
<Applejack> :C
<Arwen> OM NOM NOM
<Meanwhile> Tree sounds?
<ravus> hello bronies!
<MLP_Punk> How could the ring affect a pony, they don't have any fingers
<Elky> Applejack? Nah.
<The_Si> Yay
<Applejack> =3
<Dark_Horst> crackhead
<DuskShine> They have ears.
<Radagast> The feel of a woman
<MeteorVenture> he's more of a shut-in than i am
<GLaDOS> MLP_Punk a bigger ring
<LunaTheForgotton> kill it with fire
<Arwen> Fish sandvich is credit to team!
<HaysforPonies> Ring is a hell of a drug
<sotha> MLP_Punk: The ring changes size for the wearer.
<Darf14> Evolving, Smeagle is doing it wrong
<ThePretender> some have horns
<Ham993> The ring can change size
<CriticKitten> You forgot the sound of trees? Here's a hint, it sounds something like Treebeard
<PrincessCelestia> typical basement dweller
<ThunderDash> prrrecious
<WhatPayne> lol
<everfreenights> about time it let me in!
<Meanwhile> Critickitten it sounds like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH?
<sotha> Mmmmmmmm. These are some good muffins I'm eating.
<everfreenights> GREETINGS EVERYONE
<Legolas> 3Devolving, Smeagol is doing it right.
<DuskShine> Given that the ring can change sizes, I don't think it would mind gaining a hook and latch to fit on somepony's ear.
<Galadriel> 7heya everfreenights
<everfreenights> so how much did I miss?
<Pegacorn> ......No Bjornfort in sight.....we are safe.

<Vinesnap_The_Ram> yea man!
*Aragorn 8is trying to get some action
<HaysforPonies> Pity sex
<Ham993> Caring about the ring for himself does not = neutral. It makes him a selfish bastard
<DSNesmith> Eowyn's whispering every line, Aragorn has an elf-boner now
<ValtheJean> You know, normally I'd feel sad for Eowyn. But she ends up hooking with Faramir, who's way beeter than some crappy ranger :P
*Eowyn 14denied Aragorn said action
<Dat_Pon-3> well hes on neither side
<CriticKitten> I had a dream, it told me to take my clothes off for you

<Scottyloo> I have a dream!
<mib_emj9h7> I think Aragorn might deserve some action after saving her entire country
<ThePretender> I thought she ended up with Eomer?
<Smeagol> 6Smeagol = good; Gollum = bad; Split personalities are fun!
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when Eowyn was frigid?
<DuskShine> Well, I... I apologize, Pinkie_Pie. For whatever it is I said.

<Ham993> Epic brass
<NewDCD> 9I know it was one of you
<Darf14> Man, a emergency beaker job must suck
<scooot> there is nobody to light it!
<rainbow_dash> soooo manyyyy beaconsssss
<GabeMoist> It must suck to have to bye the guys who have to wait by the beacons
<DSNesmith1> fucking beacons how do they work
<ravus> man, lighting those beacons must be the worst job in middle earth
<General_Hazard> So cool, oh my gorsh
<maxaminus> But before the beacons get there, someone invents the telegraph
<CopperCogs> Needs more beacons
<Elky> especially when it's clouded
<fluttershy> lol
<DuskShine> For the love of Luna...
<DSNesmith1> every one of the guards at these posts slept with the guard-captain's daughter
<Radagast> New Zealand has beautiful mountains
<Meanwhile> ^
<Matt-> It must be a pain to reset the beacons though
<DuskShine> I think it might actually be Firefox derping on me, not my connection.
<CopperCogs> Needs a beacon under the throne
<SilverMane> NewDCD, I wish it was me
<GabeMoist> The beacons are lit!
<Aragorn> 8they should really just get a plan with unlimited texting
<DSNesmith1> GONDOR CALLS FOR AID
<ThePretender> XDDDD
<Ersatz> ...Dusk Shine, what would the male Luna be anyway?
<Biske> New Zeland, y u so beatiful
<Pegacorn> I'M IN THE BUNKER
<ThunderDash> There we go, it's back. 8D
<DSNesmith1> where was-
<Matt-> Getting all that wood up a mountain must be hard
<General_Hazard> OH well!
<DuskShine> I... don't know.
<The_Si> THERE WAS GONDOR.
<Rohan> Yes?
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Oh shit
<DuskShine> That's a tough question.
<Blazanax> Brohan will answer.
<DSNesmith1> where was gondor when we rode to their aid?
<PrincessCelestia> bronies will answer for eqd!
<ThunderDash> so THAT'S where Gondor was
<CopperCogs> so it literally lights a fire under the Rohanian king's butt
*Eowyn 14is all worried
<ValtheJean> @Aragorn: They don't even answer your facebook messages, what makes you think they'll text you? :P
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Cavalry about to come in
<General_Hazard> FOR BROHAN! FOR GONDHORSE!
<DSNesmith1> EQD calls for aid
<Applejack> Male Celestia is Solaris...Male Luna is...dunno
<Aragorn> 8Valthejean: okay.jpg
<fluttershy> lunis
<Ersatz> That's probably why s/he isn't in that fic.
<ValtheJean> lol
<Meanwhile> And Bronystate shall answer.
<CriticKitten> And WAR
<Riders> How will Rohan answer
<Darf14> Go king of a small down, go save a city that's 20X your size
<SilverMane> Male Luna... Nocturn?
<Matt-> DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Purple`Prose> Noctis
<CopperCogs> Nocturn
<Radagast> Mordor has already taken Mast3rlinkx
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Brohan
<Darf14> I mean town not down *facehoof*
<Gandalf_The_White> 4That's clever
<DSNesmith1> male luna= discord? :0
<SilverMane> NEIN
<CopperCogs> NO
<Applejack> hmmm...nah
<fluttershy> lunis XD
<General_Hazard> Whatever, bitch
<Scottyloo> Twilight screws up a spell and she turns into discord!
<DuskShine> Nocturn is a possibility.
<SilverMane> DSNesmith1, fear the wrath of the Luna Republic's Legion
<Pegacorn> BOOM
<Blazanax> YOU HAVE MY SWORD
<DSNesmith1> has twilight ever cast a spell without botching it?
<The_Si> Nope.
<DSNesmith1> lol
<Ham993> *takes sword* Thank you, now run along.
<PrincessCelestia> And my Ponies!
<DuskShine> Meriado?
<DSNesmith1> Merry's face
<DSNesmith1> Time for ponies
<[ger]Brony1> inb4 the nazgul-king got killed because of a grammar error
<ThePretender> Meriado...also a good name
<The_Si> Now fetch me my ale.
<Ersatz> Nocturn isn't technically moon-themed, so much as night themed...
<Meanwhile> FILTHAY
<sotha> Filthy, just the way he likes it.
<Blazanax> I like them fully armed and filthy.
<Ham993> Merry is Scootaloo to Theoden's RD
<Nocturnal> Yeah
<ThePretender> agreed
<Purple`Prose> Tsukiyomi?
<Applejack> lol wut
<CriticKitten> Dewm
<The_Si> These namby pamby battles.
<ThunderDash> DOOM
<HaysforPonies> Riders of Brohan
<DSNesmith1> BRONIES
<CrimsonRisk> 0DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
<DSNesmith1> OATHS YOU HAVE TAKEN
<[ger]Brony1> Gimli is already RainbowDash
<ThePretender> man, I love the Battle of Pelannor
<CopperCogs> So that fic's the equivalent of Full Life Consequences
<sotha> Oats you have taken!
<Meanwhile> Dat cavalry spam
<The_Si> HAVE AT 'EM LADS
<ThunderDash> LET US GO FIND GONDOR
<Pegacorn> MWAHAHAHAHAH.I'M STILL IN YOUR BUNKER LEGOLAS
<Radagast> >Tsukuyomi is overpowered
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Helm's Deep is still one of my favorites
<Smeagol> 6Dat sound
<Smeagol> 6Oo
<scooot> raptor squeek
<CrimsonRisk> 0pretty much, copper
<Gandalf_The_White> 4But I didn't get to see it T_T
<DuskShine> Wow.
<Pinkie_Pie> Sounds like a squirrel
<Radagast> was that Larry King?
<Ersatz> Dubstep orc says "wubwubwubwubwub"
<CopperCogs> Helms Deep is awesome
<Smeagol> 6Clever Orc...
<ThePretender> same here Gandalf
<CriticKitten> Well, this defense is going well.
<DSNesmith1> EQD is under attack
<DuskShine> According to Behind the Name, the majority of names with the word "moon" in their meanings are female.
<Darf14> there getting there ass kicked
<Legolas> 3Pegacorn I don't even care at this point.
<HaysforPonies> Too much trolls, not enough mods
<PrincessCelestia> noooooooooooo!
<[ger]Brony1> Aboutish CopperCogs. But i read a weirder one on a picture. That one ended with "Then Twilight was tree"
<fluttershy> owned
<DSNesmith1> Artemis is technically gender neutral
<CopperCogs> SNIPER FAHR
<Ersatz> The moon has traditionally had feminine connotations, Dusk.
<Nightshade> hammer time
<Dashite> I heard Ahnuld!
<DuskShine> I never knew a crater-covered rock in the sky could be so... feminine.
<CopperCogs> ...
<Ersatz> It makes it rather hard.
<Applejack> @DuskShine makes sense
<rainbow_dash> b.a. dragon thing time
<CrimsonRisk> 0That's because the moon goddess was traditionally female.
<Blazanax> MODS
<Legolas> 3Besides, I will just tell Bjornfot where you are if he comes.
<Rezo> Morgoth has air superiority
<mib_1f569e> her comes super ntroll
<Smeagol> 6WYVERN ATTACK
<PrincessCelestia> where are the mods!
<CriticKitten> Run away!
<Dark_Horst> for the best trained soldiers of the fucking kingdom, these guy's sure get pwned by a bunch of orcs
<DSNesmith1> moon, monthly cycle, you fill in the blanks
<ThunderDash> FALL BACK TO MINAS TIRIIIIIIIIIITH
<CopperCogs> It's almost an art in itself, when you get to that much fail
<Ham993> Not in Japan
<ValtheJean> I think the raid just wiped
<[ger]Brony1> Reinforce the towers with archers
<DSNesmith1> RETREAT
<wanderer> retreat!
<CrimsonRisk> 0Another reason bronies are so obsessed with Luna, even though they don't know it: Priestesses of Luna went around fucking everyone.
<Meanwhile> Didn't beat the enrage
<The_Si> RUN AWAAAAAAAY
<Radagast> RETWEET
<CrimsonRisk> 0IRL
<ThePretender> scramble the fighters!
<Darf14> Dang riders! Come down here and fight!
<DSNesmith1> fall back to the fanfic section!
<Blazanax> The mods are banning the bronies.
<Radagast> get the word out!
<ValtheJean> God damn tanks! They didn't hold the aggro!
<Ersatz> Well Japan is rather silly, compared to the rest of the world.
<DSNesmith1> Media has fallen
<CopperCogs> STAB
<DuskShine> We could go with Rakesh.
*Pegacorn hides under a sheet in the bunker
<Aragorn> 8lolwut crimsonrisk
<DuskShine> It's Indian, but male.
<The_Si> Victory.
<ThunderDash> STAB
<Legolas> 3CrimsonRisk WAIT WHAT!?
<[ger]Brony1> inb4 Release the prisoners!
<The_Si> *TF2 Music*
<Ham993> Silly? I think you mean amazing.
<Azz> porky the pig
<DSNesmith1> the time of the troll HAS COME
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Man
<Blazanax> The age of ponies is over.
<VegasSUbie> Double tap
<PrincessCelestia> the time for the trolls has come
<Applejack> NOT THE TROOOLLS
<Radagast> >mfw Tsukuyomi isn't in Okami
<Meanwhile> Dat face.
<fluttershy> dats nasty
<Gandalf_The_White> 4That orc's got some SERIOUS Bells Palsey
<The_Si> You got a little something on your face, sir.
<CopperCogs> Unnecessary Violence!
<General_Hazard> The time of the ManBearPig has come
<WhatPayne> Oh my god, what's wrong with your face?
<ValtheJean> inb4 Gandalf puts on his raep face
<Darf14> Oh crap, the trolls are winning
<maxaminus> Ugliness = status
<DSNesmith1> good mod coppercogs :P
<Radagast> I'll get you next time gadget. Next time.
<shadowLurker> 0I. Hate. That Face. So Hard
<The_Si> Good Ol' J.R Orc?
<HaysforPonies> Wilhelm
<ThunderDash> WILHELM
<DSNesmith1> WILHELM
<Ersatz> Wilhelm!
<Rezo> Wilhelm!
<desertman2> more Wilhelm
<Crickhollow> Wilhelm
<General_Hazard> WILHELM
<Applejack> yay
<GabeMoist> Ohai Wilhelm
<Nightshade> weeeeeee

<Legolas> 3WILHELM SPAM
<Gandalf_The_White> 4DO NOT FEAR, FELLOW LADS
<wanderer> WILHELM
<maxaminus> Wilhelm!
<Gandalf_The_White> 4FOR GANDALF WILL SAVE YOU
<Radagast> I thought Lord Wilm of Helm died in the last movie.
<DSNesmith1> LOOK
<The_Si> They got Wilhelm!
<HaysforPonies> Shiny
<DSNesmith1> SETHISTO!
<Dashite> WILHELM WILL SAVE US!
<Purple`Prose> TURN UNDEAD!
<General_Hazard> RAMESES. LET MY PEOPLE GO
<DSNesmith1> HE'S HERE
<Blazanax> GTFO
<DuskShine> Gandalf, did you summon that dramatic music?
<Gollum> 11USE THE FLASHLIGHT!
<The_Si> NO HOPE.
<Matt-> CAn't they just walk around minas tirith and destroy everything else, therefore forcing all their soldiers to fight them in the open and not in a massive castle?
<Amino> That spell needed to be a rainbow
<Meanwhile> Paladin mage outta nowhere
<ThePretender> Gandalf used Flash. Super effectve.
<Darf14> Trolls hate the light
<ValtheJean> Gandalf used epic choir boy music
*DuskShine wants to learn that spell.
<ThunderDash> I wish I could summon dramatic music just like that
<ValtheJean> it was super effective
<mib_1f569e> use don't fdeed the trolls
<shadowLurker> 0Gandalf used flashlight. It's supereffective
<Madadude> One does not simply walk around minas tirith
<CrimsonRisk> 0I can't find anything to back it up, but I was told there used to be two main pagan gods, traditionally. The sun god was male, the moon god was female. And the moon goddess was the god of fertility and sex.
<Radagast> Both Masterlinkx and Mast3rlinkx are gone ;-;
<Pegacorn> MWAHAHAHAHAH!YOU WILL NEVER FIND ME
<ValtheJean> lol, I like where you're going anon
<DSNesmith1> we have been defeated, but the war is not yet lost
<Ham993> Gandalf used castrato.
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Did I mention I could summon disembodied voices of little boys?
<PrincessCelestia> the bronies are saved thanks to gandalf.
<ValtheJean> Gandalf used: "Love and Tolerance"
<DecapPony> Hai guys!
<DSNesmith1> They've taken all the youtube videos down, and ponibooru has fallen!
<Meanwhile> How creepy
<[ger]Brony1> Gandalf Wake
<lordpie> you dare to bring holy ligh to may lair... you must die!
<DSNesmith1> they've taken the road to /b/
<Radagast> It's not 2 days ago, how long ago was it?
<DSNesmith1> and then the pass of cirith /v/ngol
<Meanwhile> It means they're fucked
<Gollum> 11Means the 'pider gon' get them.
<Darf14> King is not pleased
<Radagast> My SON!! I'm so glad you're ALIVE!
<Meanwhile> Steward

<CriticKitten> He's gone full Pinkimena
<ThunderDash> LEAVE ME.
<WhatPayne> What link?
<Pinkie_Pie> Come back in the chat Elky
<DuskShine> Maybe it's their version of Pinkie Sense?
<Meanwhile> My eyes they burn with my lack of sleep
<Radagast> what link?
<Gollum> 11Gandalf_The_White: They're all bipolar
<General_Hazard> STILL climbing
<CrimsonRisk> 0Oh wow, I didn't know you guys were so afraid of sex. My bad.
<ValtheJean> @Gandalf_The_White I blame inbreeding. You know the middle ages was rank with it
<The_Si> He wants pictures! Pictures of Boromir!
<Gollum> 11and what valthejean said
<Dashite> Gandalf_the_white, they all have ear infections. It's affecting their balance.
<Radagast> *clicks* tl;dr
<WhatPayne> I have no time for links, watching LOTR
<ValtheJean> Gollum: :D
<Smeagol> 6Crimson, stop breaking rules, maybe you won't get kicked.
<fluttershy> i thought they weregoing on stairs.
<Smeagol> 6We have a no links rule. >>;
<Dark_Horst> YOU CALL THOSE STAIRS, YOU SICK FUCK?
<LunaInSocks> Best part coming up
<HaysforPonies> He's warning him about those stairs
<desertman2> What stairs
<DuskShine> I warned you about those stairs, Frodo.
<Darf14> These stairs suck
<CrimsonRisk> 0I don't mind being kicked. Sorry. Didn't know.
<DuskShine> I told you, dog!
<DSNesmith1> come to meeeeeeeeee
<Blazanax> COME TO SMEAGOL
<CriticKitten> Those stairs are poorly designed, who's the engineer who made them? No guardrail or anything?
<Radagast> eff stairs
<TwilightSparkle> Wish I didn't have to scroll down to comment so I can see the movie
<fluttershy> its a bloody cliff
<Nightshade> shiny things change people - fact
<Dashite> Why doesn't Gollum just throw them off the cliff?
<Radagast> psych
<Legolas> 3Smeagol And that link pretty much r34
<Whiskra> and there's still troops marching out of that citadel down below
<ValtheJean> @Dashite: Because then he has to go get the ring back :P
<Meanwhile> Smeagol kicked his ass that one time
<Ham993> Called him fat, that's what
<DSNesmith1> I kinda wanna click that link now
<DuskShine> You could try having two windows open, one with the stream running and one watching the chat.
<[ger]Brony1> Because then he would have to climb all the way down to get the ring.
<Meanwhile> Fat one
<CrimsonRisk> 0Not even!
<Dark_Horst> goddammit frodo, grow some grey shit in that log of a head of yours
<Radagast> Where'd all these fat insults come from?
<DuskShine> Alternatively, zoom out.
<WhatPayne> DuskShine, I have three.
<Matt-> Gollum could have gotten the ring and killed both of them SO EASILY right there
<Meanwhile> You dumb frodo?
*Gollum 11has been doing what DuskShine said
<DSNesmith1> frodo is not a clever hobbit
<ThunderDash> FAT HOBBITSES
<CrimsonRisk> 0Do it, DSN. It's just a bunch of words. No pics.
<Azz> his virginity?
<Radagast> There were hardly any in TT
<Legolas> 3I don't need religious sex guides in my chat thank-you-very-much
<General_Hazard> LOTRivia: The Lord of the Rings trilogy became the most nominated film series in Academy Award history with 30 nominations, surpassing both the Godfather trilogy (28) and the Star Wars franchise (21).
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Damn, Smeagol passed the speech check
<VegasSUbie> He is only here to troll kick the parasprite!
<fluttershy> sam vs gollum is my fav part
<WhatPayne> Movie, Chat and Photoshop
<Nightshade> i swear frodo is derped
<Gandalf_The_White> 4I'm impressed
<Radagast> Fat Tricksy
<The_Si> Sam looks fine. Healthy.
<CriticKitten> And obviously he's more trustworthy than my friend for several years
<Blazanax> TROLL THEM ALL
<CrimsonRisk> 0SORRY! I was only trying to back up the thing I said about Luna!
<Meanwhile> Know gardener whole life, listen to thieving little schizo
<Legolas> 3Eh, he got a lucky roll.
<DSNesmith1> the trolls are confiding
<CrimsonRisk> 0Jesus christ
<DuskShine> I must break you.
<Nocturnal> I'm a natural 20 beast
<Aragorn> 8I MUST BREAK YOU
<Radagast> Ivan Drago
<DSNesmith1> smeagol rolled a 20
<Darf14> He really hates Wizards
<lordpie> so white
<ThunderDash> Steward of Gondor has totally hit Level 4 *somewhat doubts anypony will get the reference*
<GabeMoist> Pippin wasn't thinkig
<Matt-> Is there any black actors in this trilogy?
<Meanwhile> Fool of a took
<TwilightSparkle> too much white
<General_Hazard> LOTRivia: According to the cast commentary, although Lawrence Makoare was the person in the Witch-King's costume, his voice was later performed by Andy Serkis (also playing Gollum).
<Dark_Horst> you weren't thinking anything. like usual
<CopperCogs> For some reason I can only think of Monster Hunter Tri when I see the nazgul
<HaysforPonies> Stuck in the waiting room
<Radagast> The Starwars prequels had more white.

<scooot> dat pink
<Smeagol> 6Dat pink square
<Ziltoid> pink rectangle
<ThunderDash> pinkbox
<Blazanax> that purple block
<Ham993> That's like how Vader was played by like, what, 4 different people in one movie?

<Meanwhile> Monster hunter was awesome.
<ValtheJean> Yeah, Smaug wasn't no pushover

<Meanwhile> Was,
<CopperCogs> eh hold that thought, Monster Hunter IS awesome
<Ham993> Spoiler: No he won't.
<Applejack> Why "was"?
<Radagast> Fealty? eewwww
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when Monster Hunter was awesome?
<ValtheJean> @Dashite : Phfff....technicalities :P
<Applejack> i agree with CopperCogs
<The_Si> With Liberty and Justice for all.
<Darf14> He goofed up the speech
<fluttershy> amen
<Radagast> speallcheck say fealty is a word
<DuskShine> Yes, you will be rewarded.
<Ziltoid> kissy kiss
<DuskShine> You could say your reward will be... eternal.

<sotha> Father of the week, every century.
<fluttershy> yes best parts are here!
<ThePretender> but right actor
<Darf14> Oh I see, i you put a number sign at the beginning it creates a link, that must be inconvenient
<Ham993> He's an awesome dad to one kid, horrible to the other. On average... he's a pretty okay dad.
<Scottyloo> And then he falled
<Matt-> Denethor is more honest than Applejack is
<sotha> Don't forget your armor.
<Dashite> CriticKitten, beaten by half a second. :p
<DuskShine> I haven't read the books in a long time. I really ought to buy them again and get to that.
<ValtheJean> @Ham993 he sent his other son to his death
<Spazturtle> #just #realised #i #can #use #hash's #to #colour #my #text

<Spazturtle> kick'd, back in 10 seconds flat
<PrincessCelestia> noooooooooooo!
<Scottyloo> Instead of pushing him off..
<fluttershy> no!
<GabeMoist> Away with you Lambas
<HaysforPonies> Trollin
<Nightshade> Goddamit Gollum you and your shinanigans
<[ger]Brony1> Nooooooooo! Not the bread.
<Whiskra> I remember when I saw this scene at the movies for the first time, it was so sad :(
<fluttershy> so sad
<Elky> well I think using it for #emphasizing is more tasteful
<Applejack> >=C
<CriticKitten> Dude, that bread was delicious. D:
<ThunderDash> FAT HOBBIT.
<Meanwhile> SNEAKING?
<General_Hazard> XD
<Matt-> FAT HOBISSES
<DuskShine> He doesn't sneak, Sam! What do you think he is, a spy?
<Smeagol> 6And I think that you shouldn't use it at all.
<desertman2> Those aren't even numbers
<Smeagol> 6End of story.
<[ger]Brony1> Fat hobbit is funny
<Radagast> SneaKINGASS usual I see
<Blazanax> SNEEEAAAAAK?
<Amino> SNeakers gonna sneak
<HaysforPonies> SNEEEEK
<GabeMoist> Sneaking
<Matt-> SNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEKING
<The_Si> Secret ways that are painfully obvious.
<Dashite> Smeagol should change his name to Sauron.
<ThunderDash> U MAD, FAT HOBBIT?
<Darf14> I don't see [hidden] above his head so he wasn't sneaking....oh nevermind
<HaysforPonies> Problem?
<CriticKitten> Smeagol confirmed for ninja
<Meanwhile> Hat fobbit
<Aragorn> 8SnooPINGAS usual i see
<Elky> smeagol but that's boring
<Radagast> Skinny Tricksy Gollum
<The_Si> This is a SNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEKING mission, Snake.
<fluttershy> frodo is a heavy sleeper
<DuskShine> I bet Smeagol has an Unusual Conniver's Kunai.
<desertman2> It's not that dark
<Radagast> !
<[ger]Brony1> There are no cardboard-boxes on top of the mountain to sneak.
<CopperCogs> Anyone know how to get a hold of MrChess from Synchtube?
<The_Si> Problem, stupid fat hobbit?
<[ger]Brony1> The fat one ate it
<Scottyloo> Smeagol is a closet bread addict
<DuskShine> >Crumbs on his jacket.
<Ham993> Gollum is such a ham in this scene.
<Applejack> Jesus...Loyalty doesn't exist in this movie...
<ThunderDash> jacketses
<Meanwhile> Doesn't eat it, can't have taken it. DAT LOGIC
<GabeMoist> HE TOOK IT
<Whiskra> oh snap

<Nocturnal> Man, I'd throw that little fuck off the cliff right there
<fluttershy> :(
<DuskShine> How did those stay on that cloak the whole time?
<Rezo> Sam is just an asshole. A good thing Smeagol looked RIGHT THROUGH IT
<General_Hazard> XD Frikkin' fat hobbit
<ThePretender> Gollum-flavor ham?
<ThunderDash> ELEMENTS OF RINGBEARING
<HaysforPonies> Sam, you are my best friend, which is why I don't believe you over gollum
<Meanwhile> PAWNCH
<Gandalf_The_White> 4But it's good he wasn't thrown off
<Rezo> dat ground & pound
<HaysforPonies> RAAAAAGE
<Madadude> Sam is the real hero of the series
<fluttershy> poor sam.lol
<Dashite> Applejack, they don't have Rainbow_Dash
<Aragorn> 8gotta hand it to gollum, he can take a beating like no other
<The_Si> Gollum's thinking "Woooooorth it"
<Gandalf_The_White> 4If Sam had killed him, then who knows how the story would have ended
<ThePretender> as much as Ben Linus
<HaysforPonies> We already rested!
<Matt-> Frodo has a 2 in Intelligence
<DuskShine> Rainbow_Dash is here too?
<ThePretender> and just as deviant
<Darf14> Sam has a short temper
<Meanwhile> gollum can take a punch like a bus.
<TwilightSparkle> that anger
<[ger]Brony1> o.O
<Galadriel> 7we never know
<Applejack> i guess so

<Ham993> LISA NEEDS BRACES
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Frodo is simply the protagonist, Sam is the hero
<The_Si> LISA NEEDS THE LOAD.
<ThePretender> well, if Gollum died earlier...I guess the story would've had a bad ending,seeing what Frodo does later
<CrimsonRisk> 0Huh huh huh, he said load
<Aragorn> 8gross, starlight

<Meanwhile> No sam. I trust this gangly little crackhead.
<GabeMoist> HE'S A LYRE
*Aragorn 8nudges crimson risk and giggles
<[ger]Brony1> Gollum = Middle-Earth Machiavelli
<ValtheJean> Frodo is the element of Backstabber
<Ham993> You gotta share the load... you gotta care the load...
<Galadriel> 7poor Sam..
<CriticKitten> I can obviously trust him way more than you, Sam! D:<
<HaysforPonies> He's Lyra?
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Sad moment

<Dashite> Samwise has left the fellowship.
<Nightshade> frodo why you so gulliable!
<DuskShine> Samwise is best friend.
<HaysforPonies> Fancy helmet
<General_Hazard> He's too stupid to know any better :( It's like Of Mice and Men
<Radagast> They love the troops
<ValtheJean> Faramir is about to raid ICC with a party of lvl 60s
<Ham993> Don't worry, Rudywise. Your time to shine will come.

<Radagast> They can barely contain themselves
<Darken_Skye> isn't that the little girl from the first film?
<CopperCogs> STEP ON THEM ALL
<Spazturtle> I would have put the ring in a lead box
<[ger]Brony1> Send out the last defenders of your city to get killed to punish your sun = GRANTED SUCCESS
<General_Hazard> FARAMIR> I LOVE YOU
<Radagast> Gray... thingy
<CriticKitten> Faramir! Don't do it! We love you. ;_;

<Madadude> Gandalf uses love
<Meanwhile> That guy from 300

<Meanwhile> I have no idea what his name is

<Meanwhile> But he's in 300
<ValtheJean> @Dashite I WILL KILL YOU
<CopperCogs> Yeah the storyteller

<HaysforPonies> Octavia is responsible for all the music. All of it
<Dashite> Radagast, yup, he's got more than 300.
<Dark_Horst> fucking westfold faggots
<CopperCogs> Only 6000?
<Meanwhile> I brought more soldiers than you.
<Madadude> He wanted over 9000!
<wanderer> not enough bronies
<CopperCogs> NEED MORE MAN
<DuskShine> Until Celestia raises the sun.
<Darf14> 6000, man they sure cheeped out on the army bills
<Ham993> I hoped for less than half of you half as well as I should like
<CriticKitten> Dude, Saruman had 10k, 6k is pretty damn good
<PrincessCelestia> need more bornies.
<Blazanax> We must convert more bronies.
<VanHohenheim> justin?
<HaysforPonies> Youtube was blown up by the trolls
<PrincessCelestia> bronies I mean.
<Vinesnap_The_Ram> is it not working for anyone else?
<Dashite> CriticKitten, and all of these 6000 are mounted.
<Applejack> we must post ponies
<HaysforPonies> We have no more.
<Meanwhile> Let us go to the Halls of G1
<fluttershy> orlando!
<WhatPayne> Yeah, why is it that there are so few Bronies here compared to last night?
<[ger]Brony1> The ponies are restless
<Azz> Hey Matt
<Whiskra> CriticKitten Sauron's got 200 thousand so 6k is not much to come with
<scooot> HEY LETS SET UP A CAMP NEAR PATH OF THE DEAD
<Radagast> Road to the Denmark
<CriticKitten> @Dashite inorite
<VanHohenheim> craka says
<DuskShine> I'm guessing they're busy, Payne.
<Darf14> That road leads to the 80's Ponies
<[ger]Brony1> No one returned from the G3.5
<rainbow_dash> evil mountain :O
<Nittany_Tiger> Evil mountain is evil.
<ThunderDash> Clearly, this is a good idea
<HaysforPonies> Evil mountain. It has an angry face on it and all.
<Dashite> Darf14, worse. It's G3.5
<WhatPayne> Busy having fun?
<Meanwhile> Mountain of G1
<PrincessCelestia> inside the mountain is g3.5
<Matt-> For the very last scene in the movie, even though Jackson had the take he wanted, he kept doing the scene again, and again just to delay the official end of filming
<Meanwhile> The rainbow of darkness lies within
<Gollum> 11EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL!
<Sumica> Ravenholm
<ThePretender> mountain of seaponies
<HaysforPonies> G3.5 is scarier
<Azz> what does cracker say?
<ValtheJean> oh god
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Except, you know, G1 was pretty decent
<ThunderDash> SHOO BE DOO
<ValtheJean> I just thought of it

<Gandalf_The_White> 4LEMONS
<Aragorn> 8lolno, ghosties
<Radagast> Middle Earth is hell. Every other location is evil.
<General_Hazard> LOTRivia: According to a magazine article, Peter Jackson hated the Army of the Dead; he thought it was too unbelievable. He kept it in the script because he did not wish to disappoint diehard fans of the book trilogy.
<ValtheJean> inb4 Army of the Dead..."Shoo be doo"
<Darf14> G3.5!! There doomed if they go in there
<CriticKitten> Pft. 200k? So why worry about numbers then if you've already got no shot? XD
<Aragorn> 8G4 are only good ponies
<Ersatz> Combustable lemons.
<Radiance> I hear the ponies in G1 are all brain dead and need teh little girl to think for them.
<HaysforPonies> That grin
<Radagast> We need more evil mountains in real like.
<Legolas> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/345.png
<Madadude> careful there
<Meanwhile> HOW IS THAT UNBELIEAVABLE?!
<fluttershy> lol happy face
<The_Si> noob.
<Elky> G1 is pretty cool
<DuskShine> I duno, G1 is tolerable to me.
<Gandalf_The_White> 4@Aragorn: Well...at least the pilot was
<Radagast> There go her intestines
<Gollum> 11That's what she said
<Nittany_Tiger> All those inuendos.
<Meanwhile> A MAGIC RING IN MIDDLE EARTH DOOMS THE WORLD AND UNDEAD ARE UNREALISTIC?
<Radagast> YO, SMITHY
<Dashite> G1 > G3.5
<Gandalf_The_White> 4I admit, I liked the pilot of G1
<Aragorn> 8they look ugly as hell
<Sumica> dudes a danger to him self and others
<Elky> G1 > G4
<Elky> umad?
<CriticKitten> ....you know, if they're lacking in troops, they could always call on the sea ponies.
<ThePretender> dat methaphorizing
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Ugly is purely subjective
<Ham993> Wizards, goblins, a giant eyeball that wants to rule everything... nope, ghosts are unbelievable
<Meanwhile> SHOO BE DOO
<Aragorn> 8lolno elky
*Eowyn 14uses logic and love
<CopperCogs> cause he's short
<Matt-> G 3.5 Was just fucking disgusting
<The_Si> Who sends baby to fight?
<Legolas> 3Don't talk about G1 or DCD might go all SEA PONIES on us...
<[ger]Brony1> Use the force, Obi-Wan
<ThunderDash> SHOOP SHOO BE DOO
<shadowLurker> 0a pile of dog poop>G3.5
<sotha> She's really talking about herself.
<Radagast> I fight for my friends
<CopperCogs> and your a woman
<ValtheJean> Eomer: "Get back in the kitchen"
<Dashite> Elky, trollin' trollin, trollin'...
<CopperCogs> NO FIGHTING FOR YOU
<HaysforPonies> Merry is so Scootaloo. That childish joy of feeling cool
<WhatPayne> Pfft. Women

<Gandalf_The_White> 4It had decent content and story
<Matt-> elky the fuck?
<Aragorn> 8SHOOBIE DOO SHOO SHOOBIE DOO
<Elky> legolas: I'dbeokaywiththis
<Gandalf_The_White> 4So?
<Gandalf_The_White> 4That was just one aspect of the pilot
<DuskShine> Where was Gondor when we called upon the sea ponies?
<Eowyn> 14SHOO SHOO BE DOO!
<Gandalf_The_White> 4And that ruined it for you?
<Rezo> dat chauvinism
<Gandalf_The_White> 4For shame, if so
<Vinesnap_The_Ram> this makes so much sense.
<Sumica> Still dont see what is wrong with Seaponies.
<Legolas> 3Wait...what?
<ValtheJean> I'm calling it now, Army of the Dead is LotR Sea Ponies
<HaysforPonies> Big cliff don't trip
<Whiskra> Bet Discord'll be a seapony

<The_Si> "IT WAS GRAT"
<Radagast> I hate it when I love stuff from G1.
<TwilightSparkle> No no sea ponies

<Radagast> "Who is, you is, Applejack"
<CriticKitten> ....suddenly I want someone to take the audio from Sea Ponies and transcribe it onto the Army of the Dead scene, ValtheJean
<Darf14> Sea Ponies are ok
<Legolas> 3NOT LYRA
<Matt-> I didn't know the MLP franchise existed until Physics Brony
<Gandalf_The_White> 4That's because DCD knows most people hate sea ponies
<Madadude> ping
<ValtheJean> @CriticKitten I'm telling ya, it'll happen
<Gandalf_The_White> 4HAHA

<Gollum> 11HOLY FUCK!
<Spazturtle> what?
<Ham993> AAAAAAAAHHH
<Rezo> And then the stream exploded
<Nightshade> perfect timing
<Ersatz> Aragorn killed the stream!
<Rezo> Twice.
<Gollum> 11that was awesome.
<HaysforPonies> So did it land on the ground or what?
<Meanwhile> WHERE WAS GONDOR?
<wanderer> lol
<Theoboldi> that's all, folks
<Turtaguin> DDD
<Gandalf_The_White> 4EVERYTHING WAS ALL A DREAM
<Gandalf_The_White> 4But yeah
<Gandalf_The_White> 4GREAT timing
<Gollum> 11THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME!
<Legolas> 3inb4 too much spam
<Gandalf_The_White> 4As soon as he wakes up "the end"
<Eowyn> 14Inafter lots of spam
<Eowyn> 14Mmmmm spam...
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Anyways
<Gandalf_The_White> 4We're working to get this figured out
*Gollum 11is laughing for real right now
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Please remain patient
<Smeagol> 6We wants it... we needs it... we must have the stream...
<Gollum> 11oh, that timing was too perfect.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when the timing was awesome?
<crono_flash> take all the time you need to fix the stream
<Darf14> LOL, it went off line when he woke up! Perfect timing!
<The_Si> RINGCEPTION *BWOOOOOOOOONG*
<scooot> THE SUSPENCE
<Nittany_Tiger> My hand is a dolphin!
<sotha> Well, I went out to prepare supper when Gollum framed Sam with the bread. Would anypony mind telling me what has happened since then?
<lordpie> oh man
<TwilightSparkle> That was kinda cool.
<ThunderDash> > Stream explodes
<Dashite> GONDOR WAS WHERE GONDOR WAS DAMMIT! IT CAN'T MOVE!
<ThunderDash> > Chat follows shortly afterwards
<Blazanax> And then they all fucked.
<HaysforPonies> Pippin did a sad song while douche king showed bad manners.
<[ger]Brony1> We beta-tested season 2, sotha
<ValtheJean> @Sotha: Shit got fucked, and little people sang songs
*Radagast reads that Brief History of Religious Sex link.
<Ham993> Stuff happened.
<Riders> Hopefully it'll run more smoothly on my computer when it start back up
<Meanwhile> WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN GONDOR COULDN'T MOVE?
<HaysforPonies> Faramir is sending everyone after the orcs
<Madadude> That was fucking awesome timing though
<scooot> Where was Gondor when gondor was where?
<Dashite> DAMMIT MEANWHILE! :p
<HaysforPonies> Merry has an awesomeface when he gets geared
<Darf14> Where was Gondor when the movie went off line at the right spot
<Meanwhile> WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN I WAS DAMNED?
<Xaneco> aeiou
<The_Si> At this rate, come 7am GMT, my parents are going to find my withered husk and catch the start of the credits.
<HaysforPonies> Aragorn had a dream then the dream ended as soon as the dream ended
<Blazanax> john madden
<Nittany_Tiger> My hand is a dolphin!
<WhatPayne> Should this be any other place I'd be pissed, but here Bronystate the stream dropping is just as fun as anything else.
<Dashite> Darf14, Gondor ceased to exist because it's fictional and without the stream there was no Gondor.
<HaysforPonies> stream*
<ThunderDash> DREAMCEPTION
<herospirit> Can I have a link to the stream? Sorry.
<Gollum> 11Guys, consider this an intermission while we try to figure out what happened.
<Meanwhile> My eyes hurt
<Nightshade> i need caffine MONSTER TIME
<lordpie> ok
<herospirit> Oh, is it just overall down?
<Darf14> Good words of wisdom Dashite
<GabeMoist> How much left in the movie?
<Ham993> But intermission is supposed to happen right when they call for Grond!
<Meanwhile> We can't trust an intermission with an unspecified time limit!
<HaysforPonies> Well time for drink
<ThePretender> woohoo, no classes tomorrow!
<sotha> So the stream going offline worked as a kick for Aragorn?
<WhatPayne> It's almost 4am here.
<scooot> oh, its Drawfriends time then!
<Meanwhile> How will i know if i have time to grab some caffiene?!
<sotha> caffeine
<Nocturnal> Faith
<sotha> mmm

<Meanwhile> That takes time!
<Smeagol> 6The technical problems are being worked out, everypony.
<shadowLurker> 0mmmm, caffeine....
<Meanwhile> Time i may not have!
<CrimsonRisk> Have some rum
<Smeagol> 6One moment please.
<Meanwhile> RUM?
<[ger]Brony1> Well, then i will continue to write my fan-fic.
<Meanwhile> MY RUM IS GONE
<CrimsonRisk> RUM!
<General_Hazard> LOTRivia: Elijah Wood is noted for his ability to stare fixedly in front of him for ages without blinking, which came in very useful for the scenes where the comatose Frodo was wrapped up in Shelob's web-like cocoon.
<Spazturtle> Drawfreind is good today
<Meanwhile> WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN THE RUM WAS GONE?!
<WhatPayne> Take your time. It's almost morning anyways.
<crono_flash> Why is the rum gone?!?!?!
<Nocturnal> Take some ground up coffee, put it in your mouth and swish it around with some water
<HurricaneIrene> 3*TROLOLOLOLOL*
<Eowyn> 14Fcuk der trololol
<Gollum> 11DUE TO OUR STREAM SERVER COMPLETELY SCREWING US OVER, WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH THE STREAM.
<Smeagol> 6I'm just going to clarify that this is because the hurricane has caused problems with Veemi servers. We have NO control over this, and it will be up again momentarily.
<Legolas> 3Like Irene said
<Legolas> 3TROLOLOLOLOL
<Pippin> 10Stream dun goof'd
<Ham993> No time for that, just grab a bag of coffee beans and eat them like candy.
<sotha> How about a nice cup of tea?
<Gollum> 11The huricane screwed up Veemi, and Veemi is screwing up BMN.
<sotha> Just a moment! You can’t leave a tea party without having a cup of tea, you know!
<WhatPayne> Damn hurricanes, they should be outlawed.
<shadowLurker> 0CONFOUND YOU, IRENE
<Darf14> Dam you Hurricane, trying out preform Katrina!
<PrincessCelestia> Darth Vader: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

<Radagast> inb4 hundreds of Goodnight Irene puns
<DuskShine> Gollum, don't beat yourself up over this.
<Ersatz> Which means you're lying. And liars get imprisoned. Then banished. Then imprisoned in the place they were banished to.,
<Reaver21> Irene is about to get the stare from Fluttershy.
<Meanwhile> You want some cake?
<Dashite> FOR THE NEXT 3 HOURS, SIT QUIETLY AND WE WILL CONTROL ALL THAT YOU SEE AND HEAR.

<Radagast> Screw that. I'll play my own personal Return of the King and sync it here.
<ThePretender> I have no luxury of multiple windows
<DuskShine> Oh crap.
<Ersatz> Why'd Aragorn have to stab the camera guy anyway
<Radiance> 0I was actually watching the movie on one computer and chatting on the other.
<Nightshade> fuck yea kebab

<Meanwhile> Dashite outta nowhere.
<Dashite> Reaver14, YES
<fluttershy> hes probably BLACK
<Ersatz> Dusk, let me impart to you a word of wisdom from Celestia... Solaris himself.
<Ersatz> "Run."
<Reaver21> Wait, we're streaming from FRANCE!? :wut:
<fluttershy> XD
<Radagast> Everyone assumes Discord will look like male NMM
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile 7 stones = 98 pounds. I guess I do weigh more.
<General_Hazard> TWO WINDOWS IS THE NAME OF THE GAME
<Dashite> Meanwhile, outta no where? Bah! I've been here the whole time!
<Turtaguin> blub blub
<Darken_Skye> I was watching it on DVD an keeping it synced with the stream
<Radiance> 0Dischord is going to be like the adults in the old Charlie Brown comics where you never really get a full view of him.
<PrincessCelestia> I hope discord will be black and red evil.
<Rezo> Discord will be an amorphous spirit
<shadowLurker> 0Is the secondary stream working for you, guys?
<desertman2> no
<Sumica> no
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile But you're still adopted
<Dashite> Nope

<CrimsonRisk> I am your host, the man they call ghost
<Ersatz> Discord will be various shades of pastel pink and represent G3.5 metaphorically.
<Radagast> Discord will sing a pony version of Toxic Love
<PrincessCelestia> oh crap.
<WhatPayne> oh that new one works
<crono_flash> The .co.cc stream is up
<PrincessCelestia> now that will be awsome
<DuskShine> >Music at the new stream.

<Reaver21> Gollum, is the link you posted supposed to be to a paused screen?
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile Did you hear something? It sounded like your bed calling your name. yes it says, "Meanwhile....come to me....sleeep in me......"
<PrincessCelestia> Discord is one of the main reason why im hyped for season 2!
<desertman2> yes
<Eowyn> 14Yes, the movie is paused atm

<Dashite> That's so not michael bay.
<Radagast> Michael Bay directed The Rock.
<Biske> michael bay?
<hunty> michael bay shouldnt present anything
<General_Hazard> LOTRivia: In the scene when Denethor attempts to burn Faramir on the pyre, the pyre could not truly be on fire because Gandalf's horse would not go near it. To solve this, the crew reflected a real fire onto a pane of glass in front of the camera so that it looks as though the pyre is burning.
<Dashite> He would have called it Friendship is Explosions.
<rainbow_dash> that white tree is b.a.
<DSNesmith> There is no hope... for ponydom

<DSNesmith> Where was Gondor when this movie was fucking epic?
<Gandalf_The_White> 4With the plight of the army being washed away, BronyState sweeps through the city cleansing it of filth and stupidity
<TheRealGabeMoist> Final tally
<MrPeddington> everyone knows Legolas is a glass cannon and Gimli is a fighter/carry, naturally he'll pick off more small fry
<DSNesmith> EQD is saved

<Gandalf_The_White> 4Wait, did Eowyn die?
<Soarin> dat D:
<GLaDOS> Maenwhile that...wont be....neccesary....
<TwilightSparkle> noo?
<Dark_Horst> who was that?
<Lyra> spam no
<HaysforPonies> I normally am annoyed of P Jackson slowmo deathscenes but....:(
<Legolas> 3Welp, sorry Eowyn, I guess your dead
<CrimsonRisk> WAT
<DSNesmith> did she died?
<HaysforPonies> This one gets me
<wanderer> what about the theoden?
<rainbow_dash> overdramatic
<Eowyn> 14:(
<DSNesmith> inb4 liv tyler song
<CrimsonRisk> I thought she lived
<ValtheJean> nah, she just hurted herself
<Meanwhile> You'll get my name right eventually GLaDOS.
<Gandalf_The_White> 4....I thought Eowyn lived >.>
<General_Hazard> WHAT. HOW DID SHE DIE
<CrimsonRisk> Man I haven't seen this movie inforever, I forgot EVERYTHING
<ValtheJean> remember, she has to marry Farmir :P
<Riders> I think he was trying to convey an emotion of some sort
<herospirit> WELP, best set her on fire!
<ValtheJean> Faramir*
<Nightshade> magnets killed her
<ThePretender> she inherited her dad's singing ability
<TheRealGabeMoist> She stabbed the Witch King
<Silverscreen> 11The same, Gandalf_The_white
<Dark_Horst> i'm confused
<Soarin> ever had a shield shatter while your using it?
<GLaDOS> .....Neamwhile?
<Aragorn> 8same, crimson
<Ham993> DON'T BE SO QUICK TO CALL HER DEAD
<GLaDOS> WeanMile!
<GLaDOS> Neamnile?
<ThunderDash> She lived in the book, yeah
<HaysforPonies> Is this why Faust never got to do Season 2?
<Darf14> Dang magnets, they can kill now
<Sumica> she lives, this is one of those cut parts
<Dashite> Gandalf_the_white, she did.
<GLaDOS> MEANWHILE!
<Whiskra> like hell she dies
<Aragorn> 8last time i saw this movie i was high off my ass too
<Gandalf_The_White> 4I like how it's Aragorn that helps her, not her brother
<Meanwhile> There we go GLaDOS.
<MrPeddington> yeah, I remember reading in the book she just needed medical attention because of the deep rooted poison for coming so close to a nazgul
<DSNesmith> Eowyn will live, but she's not going to be the producer on Season 2
<Legolas> 3OH WAIT
<matt2> I think the director wanted a less dramatic "No" but he couldn't be bothered filming it again
<TwilightSparkle> Tragic Tragic...
<Lyra> YFW season 2 is meh
<crono_flash> She just under the effects of the Witch king
<Legolas> 3MABYE SHE IS ALIVE
<LoquaciousofHerd> Aragorn has more ranks in first aid.
<The_Si> Homer is not important!
<Legolas> 3D'OH
<ValtheJean> @Gandalf_The_White the reason is that Aragorn was a master healer
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Well, he IS a ranger
<Whiskra> so this is what they filled 1 extra hour with?
<Gandalf_The_White> 4WHOA
<Gandalf_The_White> 4FARAMIR
<Dashite> Aragorn is a ranger. He has Heal as a class skill.
<[ger]Brony1> And so, folks, Lauren Faust became just a counseling producer.
<Gandalf_The_White> 4AWESOME
<DuskShine> Damn it, DSNesmith, now season two of Lord of the Rings is ruined.
<DSNesmith> >yfw in the books this scene is longer than the battle
<maxaminus> <boing>
<General_Hazard> Phew... for a second there I thought this movie was going to be stupidly dramatic for no reason...
<ValtheJean> lol...I wasn't lying :P
<Darf14> Over 1000 people died and her death is more important, I guess royalty gives you that kind of attention
<Gandalf_The_White> 4We need moar Faramir in this film
<Ham993> And herbalism
<The_Si> So near yet so Far.
<ThePretender> oh hai there Faramir
<The_Si> amir.
<HaysforPonies> Scoot scootalooo
<herospirit> YO MERRY, WHERE YOU AT
<Lyra> @gandalf_the_white YFW season 2 isnt as good as season 1
<Dashite> DSNesmith, and that's why I had so much trouble with the books.
<Berry_Bubble> They all die??
<GLaDOS> CAN I PLEEEEASE GIVE ONE MORE TEST MODS?!?! PLEEEASE????
<DSNesmith> it's your pippin!
<DuskShine> Merry is pretty badass for a hobbit.

<Lyra> BOIL HIM MASH HIM STICK HIM IN A STEW
<Darf14> Heart surgery, your doing it wrong
<Aponymous> Sam leveled up
<DSNesmith> beggin your pardon but they haven't
<DSNesmith> BROMANTIC STARE SCENE
<Ham993> I, um... shared the load...
<HaysforPonies> Sam just countertrolled all of Mordor
<ThunderDash> POTATOES
<Xaneco> owned
<ThunderDash> SHARE THE LOAD
<DSNesmith> I thought I'd... lost you....
<Legolas> 3Loyalty +6
<Sumica> "frodo will you marry me"
<GLaDOS> ThunderDash SHUT IT
<Darf14> About dam time Sam gained a level, now he is at level 5
<Radagast> SHARE THE LOAD
<Applejack> xD
<DSNesmith> share the loaaaad
<Dark_Horst> yeah alright, give the crackhead his crack
<Ziltoid> Sam.
<General_Hazard> Sam's too stupid to have the Ring take him over
<Ersatz> Load load load load load
<Madabrony> SHARE THE LOOOOOOOOOOAD
<Meanwhile> Indeed GLaDOS i do not, my grasp of science is pathetic before your own, in terms my poor fleshy brain can understand, how much science was done?
<HaysforPonies> You're welcome!
<Nightshade> nothin at all, nothing at all, nothing at alllll
<Xaneco> *eats the ring*
<DuskShine> I don't know if Sam ws hesitating because of Frodo's obsession or because the ring was tempting him.
<wanderer> Sam shares the load
<herospirit> ALL THE SCIENCE
<ThePretender> both?
<DSNesmith> share the..... loading..... loading....
<Radagast> So that wheezy sound is the ring being tempting?
<Dark_Horst> dat boy chest
<DuskShine> Was it both?
<The_Si_BadGui> Feels good bro
<Gandalf_The_White> 4It was probably both, DuskShine
<HaysforPonies> White Hobbit's burden
<thunderhooves> this is a metaphor for marriage
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile 124,385,396,106,863,285,175,089,294,342.12 SCI's of Science,
<Applejack> i agree with Gandalf DuskShine
<Soarin> yeah what would the orcs think
<Blazanax> One cannot simply walk into Mordor naked,
<Lyra> >implying one can walk through mordor
<DuskShine> Makes sense.
<General_Hazard> ALMOST THERE
<Ziltoid> How much is left?
<Meanwhile> That's an awful lot of science GLaDOS.
<PrincessCelestia> its 4chan
<HaysforPonies> Oh hey Discord
<DSNesmith> >mfw a conversation is going on inside the conversation
<PrincessCelestia> or....
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Darf14> There's the 4chan Server

<Ham993> This is not gonna help with Treebeard's whole hobbit/orc confusion
<[ger]Brony1> lol at the helmets
<Dark_Horst> nice beak
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile in terms of Science, that's actually comparatively little
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Mordor = Moot's home
<Madabrony> So many anonymous!
<mib_5zyzsy> the trolls
<Radagast> Moar Door say "MOAR"
<thunderhooves> orcs be stylin
<Madabrony> ITS HIM
<DSNesmith> "We did it Mr. Frodo... we made it to the third book... and it only took us over half the third movie."
<Madabrony> THE MODS!
<GLaDOS> MOOT!

<Soarin> quick pretend to be bird men
<Aragorn> 8o hai sauron
<HaysforPonies> Nice mask
<desertman2> It's an Oblivion gate!
<Meanwhile> Be reasonable GLaDOS, i am small and i think in small terms.
<Darf14> The eye of MOOT!
<The_Si_BadGui> They got the "Special" Orc armor.
<Lyra> that one sunny spot in back is /f/
<Eowyn> 14He lost his contact lens
<Scottyloo> Frodo: We're SoL, oh well, lets go back to the shire and piss around with the ring
<PrincessCelestia> There in the heart of 4chan.
<DSNesmith> moot is dead, sauron is the final boss of the internet
<bronytastical> maybe you can steal saurin's contact lense
<Smeagol> 6Aren't you a little short to be an Orc?
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Welp, time to give my thoughts on our strategy again
<shadowLurker> Souron is the king of /b/
<HaysforPonies> He lost his signal
<Applejack> Psychic powers!!
<PrincessCelestia> Or maybe Suaron= internet hate machine
<Ersatz> Suddenly, Han Solo is an orc
<ThePretender> Smeagol, you win
<Dark_Horst> gimlie, sitting on a throne
<Dark_Horst> lika a boss
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile very well. Think of the number I told you, and multiply it by 352,457,374,948. THAT is how much Science I do DAILY.
<Blazanax> Over 9000 Anonymous.
<Smeagol> 6So much weed in these movies.
<Ham993> And not a single f*ck was given by Gimli.
<DuskShine> On the one hand, we've won the battle.
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Oh well, my bad
<HaysforPonies> Gimli just wants to drink and smoke.
<DSNesmith> cool story gandalf
<The_Si_BadGui> He doesn't mean to be cruel, he just wants a damn smoke.
<Darf14> over 10,000! That's a lot of people that go to 4chan
<Meanwhile> Well aren't you something special GLaDOS.
<DuskShine> On the other hand, the ring is in Sauron's territory and his army is in a prime location to snatch it up.
<DuskShine> ... yeah, we're doomed.
<HaysforPonies> Time to troll 4chan
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile Yes, I am.
<DSNesmith> counterraid time
<Riders> Smeagol = How else would you unwind from shit this serious
<Eowyn> 14I would need a lot of weed to get through all this too

<TheRealGabeMoist> What are we waiting for?
<Silverscreen> 11what are we waiting for?
<Blazanax> The final pony raid of /b/.
<PrincessCelestia> To get rid of hate in the internet, they must destroy 4chan once and for all!
<Spazturtle> Darf14 4chan gets ~5mil unique hits a day
<Aragorn> 8ITS A TRAP
<Eowyn> 14Gimli is all for it
<Smeagol> 6Let's all go get banned! =D
<CaptCrunch> Gimli = Leeroy Jenkins?
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile Yes, I am *ERROR* Irony Core Malfunction, (please reboot)
<Darf14> There over LV 80, the main characters will be fine

<Smeagol> 6DuskShine, let the mods handle it.
<Meanwhile> Mods handle all things.
<DuskShine> Sorry.
<Legolas> 3SamWise=SamFisher
<Smeagol> 6Especially since you gave the link we're trying not to give.
<[ger]Brony1> Then Gimli and Legolas killed the two hobbits. THE END

<Biske> yes
<Galadriel> 7yes it is
<Meanwhile> Well GLaDOS you missed some exceptionally stealthy hobbits and the phrase "FILTHY MAGGOTS"
<Shiggy> yes
<Radiance> 4chan mods sucks because they're practically chosen at random.
<Lyra> i why
<ThunderDash> need moar cardboard box
<DSNesmith> why, yes it is
<Nucklechuts> One does not simply QWOP into mordor.
<why> Everyone say why
<DuskShine> Not sure why, but I don't remember anyone answering so... *shrug*
<Darf14> I regret discovering that name by accident!
<Azz> why?
<DibromYAY> frying panXD
<herospirit> WHY
<Nucklechuts> Needs more "!"
<Nittany_Tiger> What.
<Lyra> what?

<ThunderDash> i think the ring might have turned into lead
<DSNesmith> SAY WHY AGAIN. SAY WHY ONE MORE GODDAMN TIME.
<[ger]Brony1> That stupid ring just weights 5 gramm, you pussy.
<Darf14> Dam it all!
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile ARE YOU BUCKING KIDDING ME, THAT WAS MY FAVORITE GOD DAMN PART, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

<Meanwhile> Sorry GLaDOS, but don't neurotoxin the messenger.
<HaysforPonies> Celestia is channeling hope.
<GLaDOS> ENGLISH MUTHERBUCKER DO U SPK IT?
<shadowLurker> sam, use cardboard box and porn, that always works
<DSNesmith> shipping scene
<Nittany_Tiger> Random lightning bolt!
<LoquaciousofHerd> Woo! Mordor naked guild run!
<Riders> Trilogy = Tri = 3
<herospirit> ALRIGHT CHUMS LETS DO THIS
<Ham993> Loads... they shall be shared.
<Nucklechuts> One does not simply run naked into Mordor.
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Sam, finding beauty in everything
<herospirit> LEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY
<Gandalf_The_White> 4He's like Fluttershy
<DSNesmith> sauron has a terrible detect hobbit skill
<ThunderDash> SHARE THE LOAD
<herospirit> JEEEEENKIIIIIINS!
<thunderhooves> TRI= 9999992637
<desertman2> They have searchlights?
<Applejack> -.-
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile I would never Neurotoxin you
<Eowyn> 14Dat spot light
<DuskShine> Samwise is still best everything.
<HaysforPonies> *The prediction of what the 4th chan War will be like*
<Nucklechuts> Just kidding.
<Smeagol> 6So... who are Frodo and Sam?
<Shiggy> they need to find the red key for the gate
<General_Hazard> Water...
<Blazanax> OUT OF PONIES
<Sumica> work that sack
<DSNesmith> need... reaction images....
<HaysforPonies> Frodo=Applebloom, Sam=Dinky
<Nucklechuts> The 4th chan war shall not be like that.
<mib_asimty> OH MY GOODNESS THE STREAM IS ON
<DSNesmith> "there's a few derpy images left."
<mib_asimty> DRINK FRoDO DRINK
<Smeagol> 6Not what I meant.
<Nucklechuts> This battle has tactics.
<The_Si> Work that shaft.
<HaysforPonies> Oops.
<Meanwhile> I consider myself exceptionally privalaged GLaDOS.
<wanderer> Sams a total bro
<General_Hazard> :(
<CrimsonRisk> Frodo = The bearer of the one ring. Where the fuck have you been for the past 6 hours, Smeagol?
<Ham993> Frodo and Sam are hobbits
<Smeagol> 6I meant if this entire thing is like the battle of ponies and 4chan.
<Eowyn> 14Cue sad music
<Darf14> There's one tactic for all battles....CHARGE!
<Nucklechuts> Exactley.
<ThePretender> I wanna be Sam
<ValtheJean> oh right
<Silverscreen> 11CrimsonRisk: Down a big hole.
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Sam is Fluttershy
<[ger]Brony1> And the hobbits are the 4 CMCs
<ValtheJean> inb4 the Mouth of Sauron
<CrimsonRisk> lol
<Nucklechuts> There would be even less intelligent tactics.
<GLaDOS> Smeagol Frodo = Lauren Faust, Sam = Jayson Thiesen
<TwilightSparkle> ham993 no.. really?
<Shiggy> a bromance at its finest
<Gandalf_The_White> 4That's my impression
<ValtheJean> = my favorite cut scene
<Soarin> its like they are all controlled by Total War AI
<Applejack> Let's get those Trolls!!!
<Smeagol> 6Sounds good to me, GLaDOS.
<CrimsonRisk> Frodo = Artic Tempest
<Legolas> 3Well I think sam is the element of Loyalty
<Ham993> Yes, it's true!
<mib_asimty> Good pathfinding for hobbits
<Nucklechuts> A question:
<ThePretender> I though Eowyn was Faust
<Legolas> 3Therefore RD for me
<HaysforPonies> Dman how much does that weigh now.
<CaptCrunch> Who is Daniel Ingram?
<DSNesmith> and Gollum is the author of Cupcakes
<Nucklechuts> What is the next movie to be livestreamed?
<Smeagol> 6And Gollum is... the writer of the fic we shall not name.
<Shiggy> STUKAAAAA

<DSNesmith> inb4 negotiations....
<shadowLurker> I liked that moment in the game
<DuskShine> Wait, Merry was the one who sang an impromptu song, right?
<ValtheJean> or not
<Meanwhile> Turrets have amazing orchestra skills.
<HaysforPonies> Pippin was the one that sung
<Nucklechuts> =_=
<ValtheJean> or yes! I was right@
<DSNesmith> LET THE LORD OF 4CHAN COME FORTH
<Meanwhile> FORRRRTH
<[ger]Brony1> Can Sauron come out to play?

<Ham993> Aragorn's sounding... irisher than usual
<Xaneco> oh... my.......
<Soarin> and once again here is a example of Total War games Diplomacy
<Darf14> Dang, it takes way to long to login into 4chan
<mib_5zyzsy> one does not charge into morador
<thunderhooves> is that the voice of sauron?
<DuskShine> So Merry is Scootaloo, Pippin is Sweetie Belle, Frodo is Apple Bloom, and Samwise is Dinky?
<DSNesmith> so who's this guy in our internet war

<Rezo2> I love how their tiny army is totally cool with letting itself get surrounded.
<Meanwhile> SONS OF GONDOR, OF ROHAN.
<Nucklechuts> That does not mean I am a mindless troll.
<Soarin> Turret: are you still there~?
<General_Hazard> LOTRivia: The runes on the helmet worn by the Mouth of Sauron, when transliterated, say "Lammen Gorthaur". Lammen means voice, and Gorthaur, which is mentioned in the Silmarillion, means Dread Abomination, another title by which Sauron was known. The complete phrase, "Voice of the Dread Abomination", identifies the speaker as the Mouth of Sauron.
<Shiggy> Lulzsec is on their way
<Lyra> Luna will save us
<GLaDOS> herospirit those are not ponies, those are horses
<ThunderDash> I beat the internet, the last guy is really hard
<Radagast> *drawn its gays*
<Nucklechuts> I frequent /tg/, not /b/
<ThunderDash> *hit*
<General_Hazard> LOTRivia:The scene where Aragorn's army assembles in front of the Black Gate of Mordor was shot in a desert that was used by the army as a training field. Because it was still littered with mines and bombs that hadn't gone off, the army had to sweep the field with metal detectors to make the danger for the actors and extras acceptable at least.
<Radiance> Aha I don't think starlight is watching chat, you're correct ^_^

<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> like a boss.

<Ersatz> Fool of a Took
<ThunderDash> y u no approve
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> that was the human town before there
<Silverscreen> 11In the meantime: Shire folk acted as shirefolk, doing nothing special and nothing of much importance
<shadowLurker> Yo, check out that epic armour!
<HaysforPonies> Big pumpkin
<whizzbang> because friendship IS magic, that would be like saying friendship and friendship
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> Bree.
<GLaDOS> Blazanax lol
<YusukeKomiya> things will never be the same
<The_Si_BadGui> Legolas prevented the Scouring.
<Shiggy> WHY IS MOVIE NO END
<DuskShine> They can't exactly have the scouring of the shire when Saruman and Wormtongue are both apparently dead, right?
<thunderhooves> small pumpkin
<DSNesmith> deep looks between all the hobbits....
<LoquaciousofHerd> Wormtongue and Sauroman should be in charge here.
<DSNesmith> this scene is so sad
<ThePretender> oh right...
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> not in the shire
<Sumica_2> And they all were bored as hell
<DSNesmith> they'll never be the same
<The_Si_BadGui> Oh and I guess this is Ending 3?
<Radagast> Act 3 of 4 of this movie ending.
<Gandalf_The_White> 4Partying just isn't the same anymore, you know : /
<LoquaciousofHerd> Big fight, hobbit's kick ass ... then Wormtongue kills Sauraman.
<Shiggy> LOL
<ValtheJean> and thus Peter Jackson removed the main theme of the entire book, which COMPLETELY takes out the entire point
<General_Hazard> Well... now what?
<Silverscreen> 11Must feel strange being around people your own size.
<Xaneco> they need pinkie there to cheer em up...
<Madabrony> DRINK TO FRIENDSHIP
<shadowLurker> "Hey, guys, let's go kill some dragons sometimes"
<thunderhooves> WHY IS EVERYONE SO SHORT
<Ham993> Pumpkin.
<Gandalf_The_White> 4After nearly losing our lives multiple times, singing just isn't very fun
<HaysforPonies> So we saved the world....now what?
<TwilightSparkle> A toast to friendship
<ThePretender> wait, what was it, ValtheJean?
<Radagast> the ending is halfway finished
<YusukeKomiya> ya score with the bar maid

<Ersatz> >mfw all the hobbit's curly hair deflates.
<Dark_Horst> see? that's what cobb felt like while getting into routine again after a lifetime in the abyss

<mib_0nz8tg> SAM WINS
<Ziltoid> AWWWW YEAH

<General_Hazard> YAY SAM!
<Darf14> That proves it, hes not gay
<Madabrony> FUCK YES
<Ceasar> the next morning
<Riders> Look at Sam pretend he's straight

<Darken_Skye> "We have heard tell that Legolas took Gimli Gloin's son with him because of their great friendship, greater than any that has been between Elf and Dwarf. If this is true, then it is strange indeed: that a Dwarf should be willing to leave Middle-earth for any love, or that the Eldar should receive him, or that the Lords of the West should permit it. But it is said that Gimli went also out of desire to see again the bea
<Darken_Skye> uty of Galadriel; and it may be that she, being mighty among the Eldar, obtained this grace for him. More cannot be said of this matter."
<thunderhooves> best ending ever
