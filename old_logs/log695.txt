<Dr_Fumbles> Meanwhile: I live in PA, home of nothing and a cultural wasteland
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Meanwhile, I'm just mimicing your personae.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How can one be in the middle of nowhere if you don't know where nowhere is?
<Meanwhile> I do enjoy being in the middle of nowhere, but it's not exactly swimming in cake shops.

<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Sumica, SB and Shizka know how to bake... Meanwhile, maybe you should add an S to your name.
<Meanwhile> How do you bake a cake, it's something like add eggs flour sugar whip until frothy apply heat then sprinkle with sugar.
<Meanwhile> Or is that how to prepare lobster.
<Dr_Fumbles> Meanwhile: You forgot the lemons... and optionally worms
*ASoftFluffyThing is confused.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Leeeeeroooooy
*Panda|DrawingandStuf pets ASoftFluffyThing

<Dr_Fumbles> I like to think that every numbered pony is the same red and black OC
<Barbetos|AtWork> mfw Meanwhile asks if the internet is serious.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03UeITHT9H8
<ASoftFluffyThing> Chat needs some random
<Moopy> Hey whats the name of that video were the spy disgise as woody from toy story?
*ASoftFluffyThing searches Youtube for random
<Meanwhile> I like to check, if I'm trying to make someone cry then that's fine they can go cry but if I'm not trying to and they do anyway I feel kinda bad about it.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is bomberman music random enough?
<Dr_Fumbles> Moopy: Give me a sec
<Moopy> ok
<Barbetos|AtWork> Meanwhile: understandable
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Meanwhile, I come from an mentaly and physically abusive home, you'd have to try harder than that to make me cry.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I guilt trip myself way to much to be an ass hole on the internet
<Jmo> nemnemnemnemnem
<Barbetos|AtWork> It ruins all my fun
<Meanwhile> It was just an expression Panda, I just want to make sure you're not genuinely bothered.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Meanwhile, nothing bothers me.
<Meanwhile> See this is what I look like when I care about your feelings.
<Moopy> just send me the link when your done searching it up ok
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meanwhile: A somewhat likeable person?
<Dr_Fumbles> this one? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoB_MDSkHms
<Meanwhile> No, the same unlikeable person just I'll ask every so often if you're bothered.
<Moopy> let me see
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Did Meanwhile just grow a heart? Or is this a facade? Tune in next time to Bronystate.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Have some giant dancing scuba men thing.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3Nt0iAu3qwhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3Nt0iAu3qw
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meanwhile has no heart
<Moopy> eeyup thanks dude
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its just a void
<Meanwhile> On the internet I don't have the luxury of reading your facial expression so I have to straight up ask.
<Dr_Fumbles> Moopy: np

<Dr_Fumbles> Love that vid
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Meanwhile, normally I am emotionless.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> So that wouldnt help you either.

<Meanwhile> Well Panda you sound like a right misery.

<ASoftFluffyThing> Dr_Fumbles, like what? This is Bronystate, work doesn't exist outside of this place.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Everyone knows this <3
<Dr_Fumbles> Lol, so true
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Meanwhile, wouldn't have it any other way.

<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srPUmJF3Lis Play this over and over till stream starts
<ASoftFluffyThing> Jmo, I never liked Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 angry mob
<Jmo> aw :(
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> ASoftFluffyThing then your childhood kinda sucked...
<Meanwhile> ^
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> ASoftFluffyThing: THat's fine.
<Jmo> Each to their own
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hmDZz5pDOQ This stream needs more Monty Python
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> Different views for different people. :)
<Dr_Fumbles> Everything needs Monty Python
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> oh hai AJIsAwesome :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda|DrawingandStuf, I never liked it because my little brother would beat me to the TV every Saturday morning and played that.
<AJIsAwesome> ohai, Panda|DrawingandStuf. :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Same with Power Rangers.
<Moopy> That shits loud dude
<Jmo> Ah siblings.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Though I'd rather watch TMNT than Power Rangers any day
<Meanwhile> Mighty Morphin' über alles.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> ASoftFluffyThing, so you never gave it a chance because of sibling rivalry?
<Kurra> this entire channel is siblings XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda|DrawingandStuf, yeah just about.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I am fail.
<Dr_Fumbles> Kids WB was my childhood... then the CW happened
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Don't say that. :D
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> ASoftFluffyThing, ^^ If I did that I wouldnt like ponies.
*SpadeMagnes[School] humms the Monty Python intermission theme
<Kurra> :O imagine if we were all siblings! We'd be the biggest pony generation! And we'd have really weird and fun family reunions!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda|DrawingandStuf, true :3. But my god Power Rangers annoyed me. My brother had just about all the action figures
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Kurra, and many food fights over who is best pony.
<Meanwhile> If you were all my siblings I'd disown you.
<Moopy> YEAH TOAST!
<Kurra> Food fights ammagosh so fun except it wastes food
<Jmo> Nemnemnemnem
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Meanwhile, hence why you are alone.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> UUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<puffmuffins> hi
<ASoftFluffyThing> He had one that was like 2 feet tall. I think that made me say "I'm not gonna even acknowledge Power Rangers anymore"
<Meanwhile> I have an actual sibling, she's a bigger bitch than I am.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, puffmuffins. :)
<Dr_Fumbles> ASoftFluffyThing: you and I must have similar tastes in TV
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> ASoftFluffyThing, its fine.
<Meanwhile> Which is ironic, because she's also like 3 inches shorter.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meanwhile: I find that hard to believe
<Meanwhile> You have no idea.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Meanwhile, heh, challenge accepted. I've dealt with FAR worst than you.
*SpadeMagnes[School] throws the Monty Python rabbit into the chat
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> smelt, whats the dare today?
*ASoftFluffyThing has never seen Monty Python
*AJIsAwesome runs and panics
*ASoftFluffyThing inb4 more angry mob
<smelt> um.....
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Never seen it either.
<Jmo> Neither have I Fluffy
<smelt> darn ive been spotted!
<Meanwhile> My sister entertains herself by looking for people on facebook that post "Waa I'm so fat" type stuff and then comments with "Yeah, yeah you are. Fucking fatty."
<smelt> flee!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Get on with it!
<Dr_Fumbles> Meanwhile: They deserve it
*ASoftFluffyThing should get to expanding her music playlist
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Meanwhile, thats it? thats childs play. How about syphoning sugar into a gas tank so that the car becomes bricked.
*Dr_Fumbles doesn't hat fat people, just the self loathing type
<Meanwhile> That's nice Panda I literally do not care at all.
<Dr_Fumbles> *hate
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dr_Fumbles, then you'll hate me <3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zPeccbnvdo Needs more Green Greens
<Kurra> why are we even talking about the mean things people do? :/
<Dr_Fumbles> ASoftFluffyThing: I could never hate you
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kurra: Because boredom
<ASoftFluffyThing> And lack of random shit
<Jmo> weeeee
<Dr_Fumbles> Kurra: because we're humans
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Kurra, seeing the extent of Meanwhile and his family :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> So I'll post something from Japan
<Kurra> ....
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Run! It's godzilla!
<Meanwhile> Actually due to international copyright laws, it is not.
*Kurra notes that apparently all of you have forgotten pony, at least overtly.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Still we should like it is godzilla!
<ASoftFluffyThing> HOLY FUCK I FORGOT!

<Meanwhile> Rarity is a mule.
<ASoftFluffyThing> GigabitHarmonie but...Pinkie is best pony
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> RARITY IS BEST PONY
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> No exceptions!
<Meanwhile> Also, I hope there's an actual Halloween stream at the appropriate time. At least something I watch better have some horror movies on it.
<Meanwhile> Rarity is best mule.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda|DrawingandStuf, nice way of spelling Pinkie. :3
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Meanwhile, but you outrank her.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> ASoftFluffyThing, but pinkie is second :<
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda|DrawingandStuf, but she's pink!
<GigabitHarmonie> CGI madness.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> ASoftFluffyThing, I know, but I like off white and purple...
<Jmo> nomnomnom
<AJIsAwesome> Double Patty Midnight Madness!~
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda|DrawingandStuf, I like pink :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> Though my OC in my head is a light blue for some reason
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't know why
<TheMaster> oh hey, its sonic
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ponies, I must go because school. Bye bye~
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, ASoftFluffyThing. :)
<GigabitHarmonie> Bye ASoftFluffyThing! :)
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs everyone <3
*GigabitHarmonie hugs back tight.
<Kencolt> That's not how you use a cane.
<Kencolt> Oh, wait-- that's supposed to be a sword.
<killerpony7733> Dat face
<MadSurge> DAT FACE
<Meanwhile> It doesn't surprise me that Kencolt knows the proper way canes work, since they were only just implemented when he was in school.
<Nerom> That smile
<AJIsAwesome> GigabitHarmonie: Thanks. :D
<Nerom> ... rapy rapy time
<killerpony7733> Haha
<Kencolt> Meanwhile: I know why they work because I have an artificial hip and walk with one. :P
<Meanwhile> Kencolt: I should've made that joke instead. :P
<MadSurge> :O GigabitHarmonie is streaming? :$ how wonderful!
<otherness> hey all
<Kencolt> Meanwhile: I'm not joking.
<Meanwhile> Kencolt: Oh I know.
<GigabitHarmonie> MadSurge: Yes, my friend! :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, otherness. :)
<GigabitHarmonie> Howdy otherness!
<otherness> whats this then? ^^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hoo biy...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *boy
<Kencolt> And for the record--having worn one from time to time, that's not how a sword should properly be worn either. To unstable.
<Meanwhile> Kencolt fought in the crusades you know.
*SpadeMagnes[School] facehoofs
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Seems legit
<Kencolt> Meanwhile: Actually-- not quite as silly as you might think. I used to be a member of of the Society for Creative Anachronism, a medieval recreation organization. I was, back then, a rather respected minstrel.
<Meanwhile> Kencolt is best minstrel. Now canon.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Pfff
<PONYPOWER> Like a BOSS
<MadSurge> The statues are like "this is the silliest fight ever"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I never understood the whole vampire hates garlic thing
<Nerom> SpadeMagnes[School] garlic has purifing properties
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Story hijacking!
<Kencolt> SpadeMagnes[School]: Old European/Middle eastern belief. Garlic was considered to have healing and purifying properties, there fore, by connection, should be good against the undead and/or the evil.
<Kandarihu> Man, I wish I could be watching this now

<J_E_Smith71> And now he can't focus on the test
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, I went over my backlog looking for an instance of you pinging me and I couldn't find it.
<J_E_Smith71> Sucks when you can't control that sort of thing
<AJIsAwesome> ShyBetaFemale: I just screencapped an image of Urkel a while back on the stream. Take a look. :D http://i.imgur.com/9ez0f.jpg
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu I am impressed by that devotion. You are forgiven just for that.
<Silver_Spoon> he's gonna fail the test because he can;t concentrate
<CountDoofus> Aaaaand there's the drawback.
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, thanks. lol
<ShyBetaFemale> hahaha AJIsAwesome looks like he needs a haircut :P
<J_E_Smith71> Maybe Steve should apply for taking the test alone in an isolated room
<AJIsAwesome> ShyBetaFemale: You should've heard the music Giga played during it. :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How long would you last if you could read minds?
<RaveBrony> Hah :D
<ShyBetaFemale> SpadeMagnes[School]: i have multiple voices going on in my head at any given time, i think i'd be ok :P

<Alchemist> well gonna go back to xcom
<AJIsAwesome> I meant Panda|DrawingandStuf. :3
<Jmo> plan
<Alchemist> lurk mode activated
<Blako> in java you dont have to take care about memory freeing, but in c++ you have to (except is if you are using vectors, what I do)
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> AJIsAwesome, nah, I'm sure she learns it at level 100 :3
<Blako> *exception
<sonicandmario85>
<Bronysith> Shizuka: and now i look for more Asuka pics for you
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony btw
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Shizuka wants to learn sleep talk but can only learn four moves
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Delete a move?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Bronysith. :)
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Y
<Shizuka> 13shizu forgot sleep well and learned sleep talk
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> xD
<AJIsAwesome> Shizu can learn as many moves as she wants. :3

<MadSurge> Shizuka: http://anime2.kokidokom.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/asuka-rei.jpg you and Vivi :3
<Meanwhile> You'll probably be waiting a while.
*SpadeMagnes[School] throws a master ball at Shizuka
<Blako> and java doesn't give you so low-level freedom, but it will point out dumb mistakes more easily, because what is mistake in Java can be some weir technnique in C++

*AJIsAwesome smacks the ball
<Blako> *weird
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Damn
<AJIsAwesome> No.

<sonicandmario85> BUT YOUR A RARE POKEMON!! D:
<Lyra`> I DO :D
<AJIsAwesome> "You don't have enough badges to train me!"
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Shizuka I assume I used the wrong "Stack Trace"?
<Shizuka> 13panda got it~
<Blako> I think it is better to start in C++ than in java, because the code in c++ is more clear I think
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> WOO HOO!!!!
<Cades> ah ok
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> C++ teaches you real skills.
<AJIsAwesome> Panda|DrawingandStuf: Where was that from? :P
<Blako> hi Spyrorocks
<Cades> haha
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> AJIsAwesome, it has to do with programing
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> HOW MANY POINTS DO I RECIEVE?
<AJIsAwesome> Then I got nothing. :3
<AJIsAwesome> Panda|DrawingandStuf: ALL the points!
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> D:
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Go Missingno.!

<ShyBetaFemale> i'm on the pursuit of happiness and i know, everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
<ShyBetaFemale> hey
<CountDoofus> Haio Sumica
<AJIsAwesome> ohai, Sumica. :)
<ShyBetaFemale> i'll be fine once i get it, i'll be gooooood
<alexxm> how are things Sumica
<Cades> Well you guys know more about programming than me, so I guess I'll listen to you
<sonicandmario85> Sumica:HI DERE!
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Shizuka -__- only 2? How I trade it back for wub and call it a day :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Pikachu aim for the horn!
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: It's nice. :3
<Blako> it is better to start learning with multiplatform libraries, so your apps can be used on other OSs
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmvm8zW0toE&feature=related
<Cades> yeah
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/43a9fb35981ded60d870f3454ab95d08.jpg
<Blako> but of course for the basics you can use standard libraries. when you head on GUI, you have to choose some good library for it
<Vordox> <.<
<AJIsAwesome> >.>
<Vordox> Oy, Phase, may I try do something not legal?
<Vordox> I have a hunch of a possible exploit that may exist.

*SpadeMagnes[School] plays the Song of Storms

<Vordox> Hai Sumica.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNwjUWKP18c

<Vordox> Mind I try a possible exploit(It's about account usage)
<Blako> and there is one important rule generally in programming: reusability of code
*Bronysith puts Sumica ontop of Chrysalis_
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Glory to the Changling nation
<Chrysalis> what just happened?
<CountDoofus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX0PVZwvxQQ
<Cades> oh
*SpadeMagnes[School] plays the Song of Double Time
<Blako> so you don't have to do the same code again and again in all your projects
<Vordox> I guess not.
<Sumica> 00,10bah NLR is the supperior nation
<Blako> so for example I have my own library, where I can create window with one line :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fine, Glory to the NLR and the Changling nation
<Sumica> 00,10I think phase is alseep Vordox
<Chrysalis> All hail the NLR
<Vordox> Sumica: Ah dang, I think I found a way around the "Identify" yourself system
<Vordox> So I can take any account, but not being kicked for it
<Blako> so I don't have to do the preparation of the library all the time for every project
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fus ro dah
<Vordox> (Of course, without logging in)
<Lyra`> Sumica! a guy asked me out, and to a fancy resturaunt too!
<Sumica> 00,10that would probably be best reported to the IRCop level
<Lyra`> i get to wear a pretty dress :3
<Cades> ah thats good
*Bronystate advises against that Vordox
<bicyclerepairman> wat
<Vordox> Bronystate, whut?
<Blako> but for the beginning in console you don't have to bother with this
<Vordox> Sumica: Alright. But I need to test it, and that means being in this chat with a fake account name.
<Lyra`> XD
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Lyra` D: dat lucky guy!
<Vordox> Of course, testing to see if it's work as planned, or not.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Are we there yet Vegeta
<Shizuka> 13should report it to #help
<Lyra`> hey, bronystate, how about we go back to my place, and we play video games :D
<Vordox> Shizuka: It's actually so easy even I am suprised .>.>
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Are we there yet
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Lyra` :D
<Sumica> 00,10and well yeah you could always do that Vordox so long as the peroson dont have nick enforce on
<Vordox> Nick Enforce?
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Vordox change your nick to Panda and you will see
<Vordox> Ok
<Shizuka> 13oh.. yeah that's just nick enforce >>

<Vordox> There we go.
<Shizuka> 13yeah but that's ghost
<UnFoundBug> but you dont need to be a mod :D
<Shizu> 13try nicking to shizuka
<Sumica> 00,10well that is ghost, not the same as nick enforce
<Shizu> 13that will bump you off the nick
<Blako> c++ and java are similar (and both are OOP), so If you learn one, you should be able to understand the other one in many things
<Vordox> >.>
<shizuka> O_o
<Vordox> I got Dced right now
<bicyclerepairman> better than kicking, actually
<AJIsAwesome> Did it work?

<Vordox> You ned to have Enforce on to not being able to get it
<Vordox> Yep

*RDash5000 catches waddle dees and throws them back
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if you learn C++ your skills will transfer over to other languages though, which is the case once you know one language well.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Waddle Dees are adorable
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> C++ teaches you good habits.
<Chrysalis> also, chanserv wont op unless your identified
<Chrysalis> and with autokicks on colours

<turtlegod98> yes i do say
<Shizu> 13make your own channel silly

<Stallion_of_War> Are these people prisoners?
<prince-dari> Shizuka: "An Anti-Social Behaviour Order or ASBO ( /ˈæzboʊ/) is a civil order"
<prince-dari> From wiki
<Shizuka> 13mfw
<Saturn> 08,01a metanym is using something associated with something else to describe that thing
<Dark_Horst> Stallion_of_War: community service
<prince-dari> So it's Order because it's a 'civil order', apparently.
<Stallion_of_War> So they are!
<Shizuka> 13but...
<Saturn> 08,01like calling the newspapers "the press"
<Shizuka> 13if they're antisocial...
<Shizuka> 13what are they doing forming an order?

<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i do!
<MadSurge> Bronysith: that's what I'm saying
<RaveBrony> Is a love bite the same as a hickey?

<turtlegod98> wtf?
<Buytoast> ahahaha
<RaveBrony> A hickey occurs after sucking on part of the skin hard/long enough :D
<Panda|AFK> turtlegod98, a hicky is when you suck your's or anothers skin to the point where the blood pools right under the skins surface. It's kinda like a bruise.
<turtlegod98> o god
<AJIsAwesome> turtlegod98: A hickey, is a bruise or bruise like mark caused by the kissing or sucking of the skin, usually on the neck or arm.
<Lil_B> can someone give me a quick copy and paste of the text pinged me a few sec ago?
<pony_7233> hello brony people

<killerpony7733> Sumica Capping is 100 per so it's pretty good but if you do alot of vechicle fighting and what not or actually just generally kill what you can but in my case tanks and air.
<Sumica> 00,10but it's worth it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> sumica who won the movie last week
<Dark_Horst> thing is, i'm usually a medium distance players
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I dont seem to do well on the killing bit
<Dark_Horst> and the jackhammer looses surprisingly much killpower on medium ranges
<RDash5000> 250mW enough that it will hurt if it hits your skin
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> who won the movie lottery

<killerpony7733> Sumica I used some 40-60 certs already and i'm already around back at my 55 point so i'm recovering on every front quick. So again this system is really really a good one
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> watch the episode from a different angle if you will

*Serenity has a wet mane
<RDash5000> AH-LOOM-IN-UM
<thisguy> i'm gonna take a shower too soon
<sonicdude558> man Serenity that must be a nice shower
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> a loo min kne-um
<Shizuka> 13that i'm aware of it was always "aluminum", the brits only changed it to "aluminIum" so the other -ium elements wouldn't laugh at it
<Serenity> thisguy: HEAT!? We're freezing our tits off in Britain
<Everlasting_Joy> :)
<sonicdude558> Serenity, do you think wet manes are *pun alert* manestream?
<Dark_Horst> funny, usually there's an i before the um in those words
<Wrek> 05aliminium
<Wrek> 05for the swedes
<thisguy> well, maybe the word "wet" i guess
<Dark_Horst> germany says aluminium too
*Serenity shoots sonicdude558
<taoumi> in ermerica we don't use that silly extra i
<Phase4> Shizuka, i've never been sure which is which, its a strange word either way
<Serenity> taoumi: You don't use the u's
*sonicdude558 dodges the bullet like a bawss :3
<Dark_Horst> silly brits, forgetting letters
<Serenity> Grrr
<Shizuka> 13serious btw, i'm pretty sure when discovered it was named "aluminum", but scientists later changed to "aluminium" because other elements end in -ium
<thisguy> using a hammer to cut. your argument is invalid
<Serenity> Colour. Honour, Alluminium,
<Phase4> alumoluum
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> did-u-know you cannot by hand reflatten a crumbled up peice of aluminum without breaking it?
<Wrek> 05even better
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm going to take off. I have a favor to attend to.
<Shizuka> 13yeah but phase you fry shrimp on barbies so :3
<sonicdude558> HI SPEED GLUING
*RDash5000 gets hit by Serenity's bullet

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> do we have any famous brony chemist?
<Sumica> 00,10squick time
<Shizuka> 13Dark_Horst: you only say that cause you know it as aluminium
<taoumi> :D tuttie fruutie
<Colt_Brovakiin> Serenity: /) !
<Shizuka> 13AFTER the name change
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: yep
<RDash5000> THERE'S HOPE
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> we should name a mineral/element Bronium
<Serenity> SeaponiesofLiverpool: There's Chrysalis, he knows a bit, but Alchemist is our scientist
<Shizuka> 13we murricans honor the traditional pronunciation
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Brony-um
<Conyst> The spray on skin graft is interesting
<killerpony7733> Sumica Also i have sniped atleast over 10 if not more enemy aircraft out of the sky with my tank today :D
<Serenity> Sorry for pinging ya both
<MecidTheGermanBrony> What's this
<Chrysalis> The earliest citation given in the Oxford English Dictionary for any word used as a name for this element is alumium
<MadSurge> Shizuka: strontium is a very unfortunate name :D
*RDash5000 agrees with SeaponiesofLiverpool
<Phase4> Shizuka, and yet donuts instead of doughnuts
<thegt90> thats a small sample
<Shizuka> 13we pronounce it le-zhure, you pronounce it lie-zoo-re-ay
<Serenity> Shizuka: Honour* :P
<Shizuka> 13we say erb and you say HHHerb
<twilight_sprinkle> looks tasty
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> okay how do you pronounce louisville
<killerpony7733> Sumica I need no AA cannons i got a 105mm cannon to take out aircraft :D
<Phase4> srsly, that really gets me, donut looks like its pronounced 'do-nuts'
<p4ngya> this is creeping me out D:
<Shizuka> 13loo-ee-vill
<MecidTheGermanBrony> What is this
<Serenity> And you complain for us missing out letters :]
<Chrysalis> it was suggested as aluminum but regected in the same year
<RDash5000> doughnuts are made of dough. not "do"
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> yay! me too
<Shizuka> 13but you can't take my word for it because minnesota is screwed up
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> some pronounce it louis-ville
<Shizuka> 13how would you pronounce "wayzata"
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> whinne-sota
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: I thought it was spelled "Doughnut"
<RDash5000> way-zahtah
*Phase4 hugs Mega_Milk
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Mega_Milk> :3
<Shizuka> 13ready
<RDash5000> :(
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, that is how its spelt, the us gets it wrong
<AJIsAwesome> test.
<Shizuka> 13why-zet-uh
<Shizuka> 13dead serious
<Phase4> wat
<Serenity> Shizuka: Sounds australian
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: -lol
<Shizuka> 13nicollet avenue in minneapolis, "nick-o-let" even though it's obviously french
<Serenity> Did the aussiegrits make that metal up?
<Shizuka> 13hamline avenue is "ham-lin" not "ham line"
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> pronounce didgeridoo
<RDash5000> hippopotomonstrosousquipadeliophobia
<Shizuka> 13but then the minnesotan accent makes "bag" and "tag" rhyme with "vague"
<Serenity> didger ree doo
<alexxm> so whats being made here
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I want a hippopotamus for x-mas
<Phase4> Shizuka, o_O
<Shizuka> 13also dead serious
<RDash5000> PRONOUNCE hippopotomonstrosousquipadeliophobia
<MadSurge> Shizuka: so it's baeg and taeg? :D
<Conyst> http://derpy.me/VAjkf
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Phase4> RDash5000, i'd rather not, my tounge may fall out
<p4ngya> how do they say bagel?
<Shizuka> 13same as always, "bay-gul"
<RDash5000> hippopotomonstrosousquipadeliophobia is one of my favorite words ever
<Serenity> BAEGUHL
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hippo-poto-monstr-sou-squi-padel-lee-oh-phobia
<Shizuka> 13but yeah, minnesotan is a very distinctive accent, pretty much any time you have a "midwestern" character in, say, a pixar flick, it's some actress from around here doing very heavy minnesotan
*RDash5000 gives SeaponiesofLiverpool a brohhof /)
<Shizuka> 13thankfully i don't have it, i was born in illinois and moved to arizona at a young age and then up here when i was ten, that kind of forces accents out of you
<MadSurge> rdash: the hell, is that a phobia of hippos? :D
<twilight_sprinkle> o_o
<Colt_Brovakiin> Meh, I am just going to stick to my formal british accent and hope it is all right :P
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> if you know the basics of a language you can read everything horribly
<MadSurge> RDash5000: ^
<turtlegod98> i like corn
<RDash5000> MadSurge: its the fear of long words
<twilight_sprinkle> COORN, ON THE COOOB

<RDash5000> yup
<taoumi> CORN ON THE KABOB
<Serenity> Right, time to get my favourite cereal for supper
*CriticKitten has been stuck in the Midwest since birth :P
*Shizuka 13pulls out a lightsaber
<Dark_Horst> lightsaber is best can opener
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<RDash5000> Serenity: do they have american cereals in britain?
<MiceAreCute> can someone give me a download link to the seapony lyra desktop pony that used to be on here all the time?

<J_E_Smith71> ...I wish I could get one of the mods to rip that and show that as a random video...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Canadian_Brony: he can still kick most normal pples asses, and his "loss" against bruce lee was scripted. Both chuck AND bruce admitted that chuck would win in an actual fight
<sub06905> J_E_Smith71: all of my wut :D
<J_E_Smith71> Conyst: It's from Alyas Batman en Robin, one of those weird forgein superhero films

<DoctoDoctorWho> MaconBane: Bane of all Macon's existance?
<Canadian_Brony> DoctoDoctorWho although Chuck is an amazing fighter, and I never watched the fight between him and Bruce, my statement remanes unphazed. I'm also not that big of and Indy fan, so you haven't really said much to deter me.
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: boo

<Shizuka> 13therefore, show

<XylemTube> Hello!
<Shizuka> 13tuurtle tuurtle
<DaringDerpy> the rearrangement looks more efficient
<Canadian_Brony> hi XylemTube
<LunasGuard> thats nasty *cleveland*
<Conyst> Then he stole it all.
<Kandarihu> This reminds me of an episode of Cowboy Bebop where a girl was using Feng Shui to escape a hit & run (among other things)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, XylemTube. :)
<DarkStratos> lol
<DarkStratos> fail
<Conyst> hello XylemTube

<Kandarihu> There's also that episode of Sealab 2021
<XylemTube> ohh! looks like penn and teller!
<PeachStreak|happy> shit if I leave and don't talk for 30 minutes my internet is off
<Shizuka> 13fact penn, pinky toes were invented for the sole purpose of seeking out things to smash into so that you know they're there
<J_E_Smith71> DarkStratos: Nope
<Conyst> I agree with the toe thing.
<DjOctavia> Fire?!
<DarkStratos> Shizuka: ha I know right?!
<DaringDerpy> moving nothing is a brilliant business model. I'll do this too
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh wow
<DarkStratos> lol color causes medical issues?
<CrimsonPhoenix> COLOR KILLS
<AVS619> red colors stimulate hunger
<Conyst> I stubbed my toe hard on concrete once.
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka sounds like an average day in my life
<DarkStratos> red ie color of love, is BAD
<StinkomanFan> Sooo... Would Penn and Teller be Unicorns or Earth Ponies? Being magicians and all.
<DjOctavia> She's actually thinking blood...
<Kandarihu> I once stubbed my pinkie to so bad that I swear it bruised up for a while.
<LunasGuard> red=blood=bad?
<XylemTube> suddenly i feel hungery
<Canadian_Brony> hit ALL the corners!
<Shizuka> 13they'd be earth ponies
<Shizuka> 13they don't need that fancy magic to do their stuff
<DaringDerpy> red keeps the evil spirits away
<Conyst> they would be earth ponies
<Shizuka> 13remember, 80% of magic tricks are not magic, technically they are sorcery
<AVS619> what...
<DjOctavia> It's all a game to him.
<DarkStratos> Be the Earth ponies that all Unicorns hate because they mock them
<Canadian_Brony> cosmic . . . volleyball . . ?
<p4ngya> cosmic volleyball, seems legit
<LunasGuard> ^ ?
<Kimori> Anyone around?
<Kimori> Cades Amu-chan Adjeca1
<weeping_pegasi82> cosmic volleyball? I prefer the cosmic fish
<Kandarihu> DarkStratos, there is no racial animosity among the pony tribes.
<NullRadix> psh, have to be proper about it. You forgot voodoo and witchcraft
<Shizuka> 13also yes teller talks
<DaringDerpy> Kandarihu: because the ranking order is clear

<DerpyMuffins> Teller talks?
<Canadian_Brony> yeah
<AVS619> $23
<DaringDerpy> fort lauderdale?
<Shizuka> 13also
<Canadian_Brony> Penn and Teller appear in a Bill Nye episode, and Teller says "Science"
<Shizuka> 13his legal name is now just teller
<CrimsonPhoenix> 115?
<DerpyMuffins> Really?
<Shizuka> 13yep

<StinkomanFan> Donut Joe, good guy :)
<Canadian_Brony> 1 hour?
<Conyst> I prefer Joes
<Kencolt> The only Feng Shui i ever really paid attention to was the RPG. QWhich, by the way, was awesome. You have to love a game with a difficulty number for disarming a nuclear missile in mid flight while riding it-- and it's possible to pull off.
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<Shizuka> 13oh my
<Shizuka> 13sounds like a perfect match for paranoia

<DaringDerpy> she looks slightly drugged
<DarkStratos> holy crap that chest..
<StinkomanFan> I personally prefered Kartar's room :)
<AVS619> ditto
<Buytoast> all three hundred and sixty degrees
<Kandarihu> Well, there's also the SNES RPG Chaos Seed in which Feng Shui is a gameplay mechanic.
<StinkomanFan> She could feed all of africa with that chest!
*LunasGuard is rubbing his temples

<Kencolt> To be fair, there are more than one school of Feng Shui.
<StinkomanFan> So Barbetos, Would Spike Sparkle work for a male?
<LunasGuard> my brain IT HURTS!!
<DjOctavia> apple bloom can be a better help than those guys.
<Canadian_Brony> Teller yelled!
<Dken2021> I'd hate to go for these guys for my room, my room's never the same in a month
<Canadian_Brony> Does that count?
<Buytoast> ha
<DaringDerpy> he will hate his parents
<Buytoast> wait

<DarkStratos> nice aim
<XylemTube> The best water I've ever had was pumped straiht out of a spring
<Buytoast> hell, i've been using the same bottle for my water for some time now

<Shizuka> 13it depends on the city really
<DarkStratos> is the taste THAT bad?
<DjOctavia> b is filled with amoebas
<Kandarihu> Ah, right. If it's not interstate commerce, it's unconstitutional for the federal government to do anything to regulate.
<Canadian_Brony> Filter your tap water.
<DarkStratos> one is lemonade
<Shizuka> 13i've had well based water, gets pretty metallic

<J_E_Smith71> DarkStratos: Because he's his partner in their magic act, their a duo
<Conyst> DarkStratos: Teller does alot just doesn't talk much.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> no its american
<Canadian_Brony> wait, this is talking about Big Brother? The totally stupid show that nobody watches because it's about stupid people doing stupid things and doing it so bad it's obviously staged?
<The_Awesomeness> yeah go fanatic but next time kill more people
<Dj_Cyber-4G> if it was brittish i would have probibly heard of it
<The_Awesomeness> sirs its to crowded
<J_E_Smith71> Canadian_Brony: No the other kind of Big Brother
<Canadian_Brony> J_E_Smith71 . . ?
<Conyst> Absolute chaos
<J_E_Smith71> Big Brother is watching you...
<NocturnalBlade> ok, i'm a juggalo and that clown was creepy XD
<Cades> yeah I'm here
<Canadian_Brony> what "other kind" of Big Brother?
<Barbetos> Derp.
<Barbetos> Yeah.
<Cades> just doing some stuff
<DarkStratos> I was born on september 11th, though not 2001
<CriticKitten> And they called it The Patriot Act! ....wait.
<Conyst> The one from Codename KND
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Have you read 1984?
<Barbetos> I need more booze.
<Barbetos> And cigs.
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome nnope
<Barbetos> Not nearly drunk enough for this
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: That's what they are talking about.
<Kandarihu> As wrong as this was, I haven't heard any better ideas. I heard WORSE ideas being sold as better, but I didn't hear anything better.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> big brother... its like saying "FUCK YOU!" to the topic
<Canadian_Brony> ok
<Shizuka> 13that depends on what the definition of "is" is
<DerpyMuffins> American politics
<The_Awesomeness> fuvk the patriot act
<DerpyMuffins> So confusing
<naturesfury> dose any1 here even cared what bill clinton did?
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: like most things the motive was good, it was intended to improve communication between agencies, but then spiraled way out of control
<Conyst> nope
<DaringDerpy> alcohol during a tv interview?
<J_E_Smith71> Canadian_Brony: the term "Big Brother" has entered the lexicon as a synonym for abuse of government power, particularly in respect to civil liberties, often specifically related to mass surveillance.
<Sylandest> btw, Shizuka, ty for stream ahead of time. Its a good wrap-up to my day :)
<Kimori> ok
<Dj_Cyber-4G> EWW AMERICANS im jokeing i LOVE(hate) AMERICA AND ITS INHABITANTS (i do love them)
<CriticKitten> And now the Patriot Act allows the government to imprison US citizens without a reason indefinitely! Thanks Obama. :D
<Maid_RainBow> so does that mean the have SOPA?
<Shizuka> 13this one is pretty good
<Canadian_Brony> J_E_Smith71 ooooh, THAT makes sense. Thank bro
<RaveBrony> I can tell :o
<Dj_Cyber-4G> while i was in New York for a week, i beat the shit out of 8 muggers
<DarkStratos> yep that camera is very subtle
<Dj_Cyber-4G> with a rock
<naturesfury> would never gess that thing on top of the van was a camera
<Maid_RainBow> DAT act sounds more like SOPA act
<Dj_Cyber-4G> and a broken bottle
<Canadian_Brony> BSS. I thought it was "BullShit Stuff"
<AVS619> BullShit Service
<Barbetos> Not the terrorist pickle
<Canadian_Brony> or that
<Barbetos> They taste bad.
<Kandarihu> Indeed. There's nothing wrong with improving communication between agencies. But it's hard to determine what's not far enough to be effective and what's too much and infringing on basic liberty.
<Shizuka> 13just like killzone..
<RaveBrony> Hah
<Barbetos> Its just like it
<DarkStratos> watch the people steal the car
<RaveBrony> Jesus

<RaveBrony> Canadian_Brony: So...for you its porn now? O.o
<Shizuka> 13and then there's THIS asshole

<Dj_Cyber-4G> yep
<DarkStratos> ha
<Kandarihu> Then again, that's no surprise.
<Barbetos> Everyone is an asshole
<CriticKitten> So basically this entire staged skit can be boiled down to "YOU HAD ONE JOB"
<Buytoast> slightly
<Canadian_Brony> RaveBrony I'm not legally entitled to answer that.
<CriticKitten> "slightly"
<NocturnalBlade> :D
<RaveBrony> Canadian_Brony: Lol :D

<Kurra> Tonight, an Obama telemarketer called me and I just told TO THE MOON and hung up :3
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: okay. Just wanted to say that NewDCD was here yesterday.
<Canadian_Brony> Sabershy or atleast say "hi" and ask how they are
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<Canadian_Brony> FFUUUUUUUUU-
<Sabershy> >_>
<Eddmario> Kurra: Nice...
<Jmo> Creative.
<AJIsAwesome> What is?
<Kurra> I don't like any candidate very much really, but I signed up for the do not call list...
<Eddmario> And of course my computer mouse died on me tonight...
<Canadian_Brony> I could've scratched 2 off my list in a single weekend..
<Kurra> and it's not really creative, I shoulda sent them to the moon with a crate of bananas
<Petrified_Discord> Abe Lincoln for president
<Eddmario> Good thing I have a laptop and the mouse was just a wireless one
<Kencolt> Kurra: Sadly, the Do Not Call list doesn't exclude political calls or surveys. Why, I really don't know.
<Eddmario> So, creative mode came out today for the xbox version of Minecraft...
<Jmo> lolxbox
<AJIsAwesome> lol Jmo

<Eddmario> I tried remaking the cabin from Evil Dead, but the xbox version doesn't have placable mob spawners in creative mode yet...
<DashWithRainbows> Joomay Daru will not be pleased with that.
<Jmo> Ahahahaha
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: What do you mean by "taking me to bed", exactly? :S
<Canadian_Brony> completely forgot about this

<Jmo> Weak chav.
<Eddmario> Sorry if I have grammatical or spelling errors. I had to turn my laptop's touch pad back on since my wireless mouse died on me. Not the batteries, the actual mouse just stopped responding.
