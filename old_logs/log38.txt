<drf|laptop> 03this being a "Pokémon fansite" is somewhat irrelevant given what goes on here most of the time
<nickstr> true
<HSX> It'd also be trolling if you go to a <censored> channel and post <censored> sucks
<HSX> Lols
<HSX> What did I miss though
<HSX> Um
<HSX> You're the only one talking about Family Guy.

<Ivan2294> So, what apout quests
<SilverSonic> just block: My Little Pony, FiM, and Friendship is Magic :p
<HSX> OMG no it isn't

<HSX> No it didn't
<drf|laptop> 03so that you don't realize it
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Shaico> idk why, they just have likable personalities
<drf|laptop> 03<HSX> It'd also be trolling if you go to a <censored> channel and post <censored> sucks
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have sworn 2 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
<Shaico> Rochelle and Coach suck
<drf|laptop> 03that's what you said
<Ivan2294> Coach should be AJ
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<HSX> I typed NOTHING OF THE F***ING SORT

<HSX> Ever hear of majority rules)
<HSX> *?
<drf|laptop> 03I did
<drf|laptop> 03why
<Mongoose|Postal2> lol
<Ivan2294> AJ = Coach Twilight = Nick Pinkie Pie = Ellis Rarity = Rochelle?
<HSX> That'e why when you're talking about family guy and nobody else cares you're sol
<Shaico> No way
<SilverSonic> Hey I like Family guy kthx
<SilverSonic> :P
<Retsamoreh> Trixie = Rochelle
<Nightmare_Moon> I would, that's not how you treat your goddess.
<Shaico> Rarity is too good for Rochelle
<HSX> If everyone else likes Family Guy except one person then HE'S sol
<Shaico> Rochelle has no personality, so hard to decide
<Ivan2294> We are using main characters
<Retsamoreh> so
<Mongoose|Postal2> uhh
<Ivan2294> Rochelle is kinda bland
<Retsamoreh> Rochelle is a parasprite
<Shaico> Rochelle should be a background pony
<HSX> Same with you and other people when some other people like some of Gen 5.
<Ivan2294> So Trixie wouldn't fit her
<SilverSonic> well, i think Mods do what they want </sucking up but being honest>
<SilverSonic> :P
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Mongoose|Postal2> Thats what I was going to say.
<Light_Latias> or she, Chime
<Nightboomfer> Derpy?
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<HSX> Mods who do that don't deserve to be mods
<Ivan2294> Main characters guys
<drf|laptop> 03not to mention
<HSX> Yes I know LL
<Ivan2294> Come on
<Shaico> no Rochelle has no character
<HSX> He is faster to type than She
<drf|laptop> 03when's the last time I talked about Family Guy on here before now
<drf|laptop> 032 months ago?
<drf|laptop> 033?
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<HSX> By a letter yes xD
<Ivan2294> Rarity would be who then?
<Shaico> it can't be decided
<drf|laptop> 03I need to go
<SilverSonic> She?
<HSX> K
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Ivan2294> Fluttershy woudl be who?
<Shaico> Rarity would be uhhhh

<Nightboomfer> They got sent to the moon
<Shaico> So many people left
<Nightmare_Moon> Yes I love netsplits
<SilverSonic> Ĺ
<Ivan2294> Derpy has more personality that Luna
<Nightmare_Moon> It's how IRC trolls people with bad modems
<John316> what is netsplit?
<Flamerunner> i think Moondust would fit for Nightmare Moon
<Shaico> I don't have any problems with anypony in MLP
<Shaico> At all
<Light_Latias> at times
<Ivan2294> Me neither
<Light_Latias> :|
<Shaico> I literally do not hate anypony
<Ivan2294> But Luna is overrated
<Shaico> they are all lovable :D
<Light_Latias> not ALL the time mind
<Ivan2294> Same
<Ivan2294> I LOVE ALL OF YOU
<Nightboomfer> Even Snips/Snails?
<SilverSonic> so its not fact :P
<Ivan2294> FORCED CUDDLE
<Mongoose|Postal2> The only ponies i dislike is Snips and Snails
<Scarlett> Same. They all have good and bad points to me.
<Shaico> Yep even Snips and Snails
<Shaico> But I love them the least
*Ivan2294 forces a group hug between everyone
<ZekeS|AFK> John316: what we see as one irc channel is supplied by members from many irc servers
<Mongoose|Postal2> awwwww
*Shaico can't breath.
<ZekeS|AFK> John316: a netsplit occurs when some of those servers disconnect from each other
*Retsamoreh dies from being sucked into the group hug
<SavagePlatypus> wat up everyone :D
*Flamerunner kicks Ivan nuts
<Nightboomfer> hi
<HSX> Fiiine xD
<HSX> He acts like a child
*Ivan2294 hugs so tightly it creates a condensed black hole
<John316> okay
<Mongoose|Postal2> Ivan nuts sound good.
<Flamerunner> http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png LOOK AT ME.
<Mongoose|Postal2> in a non sexual wayu
<HSX> And has an immature additude to things of his dislike
<Mongoose|Postal2> way*
<HSX> Better~? :3
<Ivan2294> Okay
*Ivan2294 lets go
<sketch> lol
<Light_Latias> acts spoiled >.>
<Light_Latias> WAY too often
<Klondike> Hello folks.
<Scarlett> hey
<Mongoose|Postal2> hey
<John316> hi hi
<Ivan2294> AJ = Coach Rarity = Zoey Pinkie = Ellis Twilight = Nick Rainbow Dash = Francis
*Light_Latias sighs
<Shaico> Ivan nuts
<Shaico> lol i just got that
<Light_Latias> he's a pain
<HSX> Yus
<Light_Latias> but he's MY pain
<HSX> :c
<Light_Latias> :P
<HSX> Rofl
<John316> Fire solves all problem
<prince-dari> Don't worry, I'm not planning on stealing him from you.
<Shaico> Even a house burning down?
<HSX> Ooookay xD
<HSX> He just needs to wise up
<prince-dari> Yet.
<Steelion> hey there everypony
<Ivan2294> yes shaico
<prince-dari> Soon.jpg
<Ivan2294> Because it gets rid of the burning house
<Shaico> The burning house is the problem?
<John316> no house no problem
<Shaico> Or is the burning the problem?
<Ivan2294> Exactly
<Shaico> What if you are thirsy?
<Ivan2294> The burning stops after the house is burnt down
<Chimera> Wut
<Chimera> pd wat
<Chimera> owo
<sketch> oh noes, perspective argument
<Steelion> burn it with the lemons
<Shaico> come up with a clever solution to quench my thirst using fire
<Steelion> soz wrong meme
<Klondike> So our solution to a burning building is blowing up the building next to it.
<Mongoose|Postal2> yes
<Ivan2294> Okay
<Ivan2294> Hold on
<Retsamoreh> In the end, it's a genius plan.
<John316> well you dies and no longer haz thrists!!1!
<Klondike> Alright, I think I know where you're going at.
<Steelion> shaico, if you die in a fire, you are no longer thirsty
<prince-dari> Oh, was I saying that out loud?
<MoronSonOfBoron> In the end, Retsamoreh?
<MoronSonOfBoron> Nothing ever ends.
<Shaico> Dammit Steelion
<prince-dari> :P
<Steelion> dang
<sketch> oh sure it does Moro
<Steelion> beat me to it
<Ivan2294> There is a giant bottle full of water and you use the fire to melt the plastic, thus releasing the water and quenching your thirst
<sketch> I believe Stephen Hawking defined the begining of time as the first event that influenced the events after it
<Nightboomfer> I want a gummy figurine
<sketch> so the end of everything would be the last event that influenced anything
<Ivan2294> So logically we can do stuff
<Shaico> Ok then how about if our goal was to extinguish a fire?
<Ivan2294> Just not influence ANYTHING
<sketch> fire would eventually burn itself out with no fuel
<oscarMIKE> sup bronies
<MoronSonOfBoron> Well, Ivan
<MoronSonOfBoron> We ARE in this chatroom here.
<sketch> no events would follow
<MoronSonOfBoron> heyoooooo
<Shaico> i hate you guys
<Klondike> Deprive it of oxygen.
<Ivan2294> Wait what?
<Retsamoreh> I hate us too, Shai.
<Steelion> ditto
<Klondike> Love myself, better than you.
<Ivan2294> What are you talking about MoronSonofborn?
<Mongoose|Postal2> i love you shaico
<Ivan2294> I LOVE EVERYONE
<Shaico> I love you too Goose.
<Shaico> Somewhat
<Klondike> And I love Lee Carson Jr.
*Ivan2294 does another forced hug
<MoronSonOfBoron> >implying that being in this chatroom is an entirely meaningless activity
<John316> There are many definitions of immortality. for example, you can live as long as the universe last... or you can make sure the universe only lasts as long as you do
<Scarlett> That is a lot of love
<Nightboomfer> I tolerate everyone
<Steelion> ditto ^_^
*Shaico uses fire to solve problem.
<Shaico> Hurhurhurhur
<Ivan2294> Wait what?
<DuskBright> 0hmmm.
<Steelion> lol
<DuskBright> 0lets wake up DCD
<Shaico> The problem is your hug
<sketch> lol Nightboomfer
<Ivan2294> I DON'T GET IT
<MoronSonOfBoron> Never mind, that went over people's heads
<Shaico> so I burnt your arms
<DuskBright> 0with ponies
<drf-Dro64> wtf
<Shaico> and you let go
<Klondike> There are two things I hate in this world. People who are ignorant of other peoples cultures and the Dutch.

<Klondike> That's a nice everything you got there.
<Ivan2294> Anyone take Nukes seriously though? Ever?
<Shaico> oh is this topic nukes now?
<eXAKR> CLICK IT
*eXAKR RUNS
<Klondike> Duke Nukem should be taken seriously.
<Ivan2294> No idea who you are talking about Shaico
<Ivan2294> And I don't care
<Retsamoreh> I take nukes seriously when you are talking about them seriously.
<Shaico> lololol
<Ivan2294> BECAUSE MAVERICKS WOOOO
<Ivan2294> Okay back to nukes
*John316 swears revenge on all dolphins and whales
<sketch> that's a good answer
<drf-Droid> no.
<Klondike> Woooo! Spring Break.
<Retsamoreh> As they are currently one of the most powerful weapons in the entire world.
<Lambda> Haha
<John316> forget you ocean mammals
<Shaico> wait nukes right?
<Shaico> KOREAN WOOWOWOWOWOW
<Ivan2294> Lets talk about Nukes seriously and see where it heads.
*Outline gets John316's reference :)
<John316> Thanks
<Klondike> No. Friendship is the most powerful weapon.
<Ivan2294> Who here thinks Israel has nukes?
*Shaico also get's the reference
<drf-Droid> anyway I should sleep
<drf-Droid> bye
<sketch> I don't - they would have at least tested one if they did
<DJMidli> they do and don't
<prince-dari> LOL
*Shaico and is lol'ing that he got the reference.
<Retsamoreh> Well, I personally respect nukes in the "The Stand" scenario.
<sketch> but they are close
<sketch> (probably)
<Klondike> I loved The Stand.
<DJMidli> israel has some borrowed from the states.
<DJMidli> and its bombing only.
<Ivan2294> Some say they worked with South Africa on nukes
<prince-dari> Also, on that page.
<Ivan2294> South Africa did have 6 at one point.
<prince-dari> Scroll down a bit.
<sketch> That's a good point DJ, that makes sense
<Neon> That's a Neon original.
<prince-dari> Look at the first few images.
<SilverSonic> lmfao
<prince-dari> You'll probably know when you see it.
<SilverSonic> heh Drf isnt that stupid to click a troll link :P
<Retsamoreh> How do you borrow a nuke?
<Ivan2294> All I know is that North Korea better die soon
<DJMidli> although that was 10 years ago. the might now own their own.
*John316 has been to South Africa before
<sketch> and sorry, for some reason I was not thinking Isreal - they do I imagine. Iran is what I was thinking of.
<Ivan2294> North Korea has a few, only a few, nukes now
<Ivan2294> But that won't last forever
<Neon> And then I said "Let my people go."
<Shaico> YES hahahahhah!
<Shaico> I got McDonalds to deliver some food to me!
<Shaico> hurhurhur
<Ivan2294> how?
<Nightmare_Moon> I just facehoofed so hard. All the new nightmare moon art popping up on Ponibooru and not a single Nightmare Moon account. Screwit, I took it.
<Shaico> i called them
<Shaico> and asked for a delivery
<sketch> good lord this is an IRC chat, this is the first time I've been in an IRC chat in like... seriously 6 years
<DJMidli> israel has 80 apparently...
<Shaico> They got delivery over where I am
<DJMidli> and they are their own
<Nightmare_Moon> sketch, irc is the greatest chat protocol in the world
<DJMidli> so not borrowed from the states.
<sketch> Oh I agree
<Flamerunner> Well ponies i gotta get goin'
<John316> <3 IRC
<sketch> shows how much I chat, to be honest..
<Shaico> im gonna be going in and out of this chat
<Ivan2294> We need to kill North Korea
<Flamerunner> SEE YA TOMORROW
<Shaico> gonna finally finish L.A. Noire
<Ivan2294> BADLy
<Flamerunner> and yes
<Flamerunner> KILL COREA :D
<MoronSonOfBoron> No
<MoronSonOfBoron> We need to Love and Tolerate™ Korea
<Ivan2294> By we I mean everyone
<Ivan2294> no
<sketch> Tolerate the hell out of North Korea ;)
<Klondike> Hit it with a stick!
<Ivan2294> Seriously, we are techincally still at war with them.
<Flamerunner> HIT IT WITH A CROWBAR™
<prince-dari> LOL
<John316> Pinata
<prince-dari> Also on that page: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0HZhM_CrSg
<prince-dari> John Cleese FTW
<Nightmare_Moon> I wouldn't have joined EqD chat if it never made the switch to IRC, to be honest
<DJMidli> Interesting.
<Ivan2294> And south korea NEVER even signed an armistice
<John316> How I make ~ over my n?
<DJMidli> Israel will disarm its nuclear stockpile when there is peace in the middle east.
<Flamerunner> spanish keyboards only
<Flamerunner> ñ
<Flamerunner> ñññ
<DJMidli> so pretty much never. but its a nice gesture on their part lol
<Flamerunner> ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ
<Flamerunner> hahhahah.
<Flamerunner> you mad
<Klondike> That'll never happen. lol
<Flamerunner> Ñ
<Kasatania> hay guise
<sketch> I imagine I wouldn't stick around if it wasn't Nightmare - but then I haven't used a java chat or something similar in nearly as long
<Ivan2294> So we don't even need to sign any paper work, just send in the marines or army or whatever
<sketch> but I remember them being SLOW
<MoronSonOfBoron> Mac keyboards have easy non-English character access
<John316> do alt codes work here
<MoronSonOfBoron> Yes they do, John
<Ivan2294> North Korea better die by the time I am dead
<sketch> yes Θ
<Nightmare_Moon> Plugin based chats are simply awful, sketch.
<MoronSonOfBoron> Simply AWFUL~
<[zZz]ekeS> Nightmare_Moon: I could have shown you how to use normal IRC w/ EWC :p
<MoronSonOfBoron> I just imagined Rarity as a software designer
<sketch> I believe it, glitchy, laggy.. etc
<[zZz]ekeS> Wouldn't fix the crashing 3x days
<Neon> I lost a little respect for John Cleese when he said he was "too busy" to help write a sketch with the Whitest Kids U' Know.
<Ivan2294> How to kill north korea, discuss
<Nightmare_Moon> [zZz]ekeS, no. Java based, flashed based and other nonsense based plugins are terrible terrible things.
<sketch> I cannot get my mind to wrap around rarity designing software
<Balloons> No let's not Ivan
<Ivan2294> Fine...
<Nightmare_Moon> They have memory leaks incredibly impressive for a plaintext based application.
<John316> regedit
<John316> +rarity
<prince-dari> I don't know what that is.
<MoronSonOfBoron> Thread by thread, coding it together
<Ivan2294> Well I'm tired.
*John316 fails at code
<Ivan2294> Also that actually works
<Ivan2294> Lol
<Neon> It's a comedy troupe with a show.
<Ivan2294> Bye
<Ascendant> I forgot that I set that
<Ascendant> !define test
<[TST]Bot> -!- A procedure for critical evaluation; a means of determining the presence, quality, or truth of something; an examination, or experiment.
<Neon> They're hilarious and absurdist, just like Monty Python was.
<sketch> well.. at least her code might be legible. Linebreaks and commented nicely
<Ascendant> o_O
<Neon> Yet he won't help out an up-and-coming generation that started out just like him.
<MoronSonOfBoron> Comment line, perfect documentation saves you time
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<NightSeas> 12Hello Ascendant
<Ascendant> hi
<Klondike> ...yay.
<John316> the only coding I know is visual basic and I use it for excel spreadsheet calculations. like the time i wrote a macro to calculate derivatives and such
<sketch> which I'm sure is why my C++ teacher liked to take off so many points for sloppy looking code and poor documentation.... O.o
<DSD> 4Skylanders needs armor
<sketch> I doubt I know any coding anymore. Like any language... if you don't use it.. etc.. etc
<MoronSonOfBoron> Checking in another project file, step outside, this sync might take a while
<Icy> Haha no
<DSD> 4Why?
<MoronSonOfBoron> Mind those specification details, even though she's more concerned with sales
<sketch> um.. so anyway, since this chat seems to have slowed... Nukes right? Yeah.. they... :)
<John316> Always bet on the duke
<John316> there is a captain planet character named Duke Nukem
<sketch> Really? lol, cool
<Shaico> What?
<[zZz]ekeS> yep
<sketch> I mean cool in the probably geekiest/ 90's cartoon way
<John316> http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/7862/dukenukemmosc1a.jpg
<[zZz]ekeS> Which is why it's Duke NukEm now instead of Duke NukUm like in the very forst gane
<sketch> heh, crazy
<Shaico> I don't like the game at all.
<Shaico> Duke Nukem forever is a huge dissapointment
<MoronSonOfBoron> But it IS huge, yes?
<John316> MONKEY PAW!!!
<LimeyD> Ehhhhhhhhh
<sketch> I kinda want to play it.. I don't expect the graphics to be any good
<sketch> or really the engine to be at all solie
<sketch> >>solid
<Shaico> it's repetive
<Shaico> and boring
<sketch> but I kinda want there to be a humor and feel that brings it back to Duke 3d days
<sketch> but I've heard the same Shaico - kinda a shame
*John316 should have known better than to wish for the release of Duke Nukem forever using the magic monkey paw
<Shaico> yeah. i liked the opening a bit
<Shaico> you could control your piss and stuff
<Wierdplatformer> so true John
<Shaico> but the rest of the game bored me
<Wierdplatformer> PAAAAWWWWWW!
<John316> lol
<sketch> sad
<BiiiiigMacintosh> Mornin' everypony
<Balloons> morning.
<John316> evenin'

<DuskBright> 0Sprinkles is back?
<Mongoose|Postal2> sounds hot
<BiiiiigMacintosh> o.o;;
*John316 plays ponypolka
<Shaico> i mean i'm eating McDonald's Big Mac
<Shaico> Silly
<Ray||MH> 02the..heck?
<Ascendant> ?
<sketch> lol
<Ghosties> 4I thought Sprinkles was going home
<Mongoose|Postal2> still hot
<Shaico> meh needs to be hotter
<John316> Look coffee
<John316> ^its hot
<Shaico> but too lazy to put the burger in the microwave
<Nightmare_Moon> microwave? D=
<KenjiBeast> Evening now everypony
<KenjiBeast> So my mom threw away my rarity brushable
<Nightmare_Moon> What o.=.o
<John316> A microwave is a low quality radar system
<Ali1017> you DID go dumpster diving for it right
<Ray> 02also Hi NS~
<[zZz]ekeS> KenjiBeast: any particular reason?
<Ascendant> heya
<sketch> O.o
*Ascendant stares away at Ray
<Ali1017> it's rarity, THINK of the whining
<KenjiBeast> She was like "Oh, that's garbage"
<Armageddon> !peak
<EpicStatsGuy> Current channel peak for #True-Flame is 71, set 18wks 5days 8hrs 14mins 21secs ago.
<Nightshadow|VNC> Peak for #True-Flame is 46 set on 05/06/2011
<Armageddon> derp
<Balloons> o.O
<KenjiBeast> Garbage man comes around on fridays
<MoronSonOfBoron> Did you come to your lady's rescue?
<Nightmare_Moon> Pfft, I'd hate to image what she would do if she saw you with a Pinkie Pie brushable
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<KenjiBeast> I'll just pretend she's avoiding Gummy's after birthday party
<Nightmare_Moon> *imagine
<sketch> eh, you should just sing the theme while brushing it, it's fine ;)
<KenjiBeast> I'm considering getting a full on pinkie pie plushie to replace my dear rare
<John316> I have enough nerd credit to get away with liking whateva
<MoronSonOfBoron> My Little Toy Story
<Ali1017> what, and invoke the beast called Pinkamena
<Nightboomfer> When does the garbageman come?
<John316> without people thinking its strange for me
<Nightmare_Moon> My parents still cant' believe I watch 'a show for little girls' They're fooling themselves if they think that's all it is.
<{SV}Matt> 18 weeks
<{SV}Matt> god damn
<{SV}Matt> :O
<{SV}Matt> almost 19 weeks
<Archfiend> XD
<Nightboomfer> If he hasn't come yet, the trash can probably hasn;t been emptied yet
<Archfiend> That was the spambot attack though
<Icy> idk
<Archfiend> and that reminds me
<John316> start playing minesweeper all the time. and use your keyboard only.
<Mongoose|Postal2> Everyone thinks that about us
<KenjiBeast> Garbage man comes in the afternoon when I was out @ wal mart
*John316 can beat intermediate mode in 10 seconds flat.
<Lambda> hey, Mikey or prince-dari
<prince-dari> ?
<Lambda> either of you know who Dexter is
<Mikey> huh
<Mikey> no
<prince-dari> Dexter from where?
<Lambda> #bronies
<Lambda> he's been there all day
<prince-dari> Oh, no, he turned up here sometime.
<prince-dari> I said "hey", but he left immediately.
<Lambda> huh, weird
<John316> kidding. my best time was closer to 60 seconds on intermediate. 3 seconds on easy and 170 seconds expert
<widlyWham> yo everypony!

<Lambda> :(
<Mikey> oh yeah I hate that
<Lambda> your mom decided against it?
<Mikey> one year I won a blue scorchio
<Lambda> Woah
<Lambda> that would be awesome
<Mikey> yeah I still have it
<Mikey> it's fairly big
<Lambda> should dress it up like my scorchio
<Lambda> :P
<Mikey> I should take a pic of it sometime
<Nightmare_Moon> God damned netsplits -.=.-
*John316 watches the minesweeper movie trailer
<John316> @__@
<John316> NETSPLITS ~
<widlyWham> ?
<Nightmare_Moon> Hurray! Netsplits
<John316> servers are disconnecting from one another~
<widlyWham> ah
<Mikey> and yeah I didn't get to go; like I said I mostly wanted to go just to see my friends...I'll see the same people next week, but that feels so far away still
<Leafeon> i see

<Lambda> At least you'll get to see them though
<Lambda> oh no
<Lambda> D:

<Mongoose> yo
<John316> woah, tons of posts in like a fraction of a second!
<Nightmare_Moon> These servers don't handle netsplit too well do they?
<John316> Can anyone hear me still? raise a hoof if you can
<BiiiiigMacintosh> I'm...seeing this o.o That was interesting...
<MoronSonOfBoron> People are shallow, sensationalist cads who operate on sweeping assumptions and ill-formed opinions
*John316 is alone in here
<Mongoose> hey buddy
<sketch> Sure MoronSonofBoron, but a person is not :)
<Chromadancer> gah
*John316 so alone on his side of the netsplit
*BiiiiigMacintosh raises a hoof in response, belatedly.
<Lambda> pushed like in a mosh pit?
<SirSprinkles> 6Look! A parasprite! :p
<Mikey> yes
<Sprinkleberg> D:
<Sprinkleberg> but but
<Sprinkleberg> :(
<Mikey> seattle crowds are fucking wild no matter where I go
<Sprinkleberg> i guess you havnt noticed me at all then haha
<SirSprinkles> 6If you're going to use the name, expect to be called one.
<Lambda> ha, I can beleive it
<Mikey> and aiden gets fairly rough I need to cling onto my spot during wall of death so I don't die
<SirSprinkles> 6I noticed you right away.
<SirSprinkles> 6You've been nickchanging all day.
<MFW> ok then :(
<Lambda> D:
<MFW> xDD
<SirSprinkles> 6It's my job to watch the chat, sillyfilly.
<Lambda> I'd be terrified in a place like that
<Lambda> I get nervous in malls...
<Mikey> ...XD really?
<MFW> Mr sprinkles i do have to say that i have enjoyed your stream for the past...
<MFW> hmm
<Lambda> I'm not good with people
<MFW> yes
<Lambda> or crowds I should say
<Mikey> MY LIFE http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwbMtL-dz1A
<Lambda> where I grew up there's no such thing as a crowd
<Lambda> ever
<SirSprinkles> 6Over 24 hours. Except the short 5 hour break I took. And then the end now.
<MFW> yessir i have been enjoying it ever since
<MFW> except this morning
<prince-dari> I love mosh pits. XD
<Mikey> actually now that I look at that video I've seen better wod videos of their shows
<MFW> are YOU gonna stream next week? :D
<Mikey> but I've seen aiden 8 mil times so I'm used to their regular activities they do this every show
<prince-dari> We had 2 wall of deaths when my friend was playing with his band somewhere.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll likely do Saturday, I think.
<Mikey> there was only one show that they didn't do it at and I think it was because it wasn't very crowded
<MFW> nasjdgkasg
<MFW> ill be there
<SirSprinkles> 6But I'm pretty sure DCD is doing Friday.
<MFW> ahaha
<prince-dari> Someone spilt water all over the floor so everyone was nearly falling over/falling over all the time. XD
<MFW> well then..today and yesterday was fun
<MFW> ill see you next week :D
<Mikey> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Of course.
<MFW> cya~
<Mikey> this video looks better
<Mikey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYDrb7cJhOI
<SirSprinkles> 6G'night.
<Mikey> I never participate but it's amazing to watch in person, I usually try to get front row spots so I turn around and watch
<Lambda> D: that looks scary as ****
<prince-dari> Lawl, it's fun.
<prince-dari> Some guy stood right in the centre just beforehand.
<prince-dari> So we crushed him. (:
<Mikey> XD dari is hardcore
<prince-dari> Haha, hardly. XD
<prince-dari> The guy who went to stand in the middle was.
<Mikey> :P
<Archfiend> ohai Darklust
<prince-dari> Seems as though you get to see a lot of awesome people playing though Mikey.
<Mikey> yeahh
<Mikey> aiden is the only band I usually see that does wod's though
<Mikey> MY DREAM IS TO CROWDSURF ONE DAY
<Mikey> /shot
<prince-dari> Hahaha. XD That'd be cool.
<Mikey> omg so
<Mikey> when I saw snowing a week or two ago
<Mikey> there's no stage no barrier
<Mikey> and I got shoved right into the singer dude
<Darklust> hullo
<prince-dari> LOL. XD
*Cqis pokes Aristeo's channel again!
<Mikey> I had to move I was worried that if I kept getting pushed into them I'd fuck up their sound or equipment
<Archfiend> ;o
<Aristeo> o.o
<Mikey> I have a pic on my cellphone one minute I'll link it
<Mikey> it's like just the dude's head
<Mikey> and nothing else
<Cqis> Well I got booted the first time, so I had to see if it would happnen again
<Mikey> http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/246835_1785419201242_1412375489_31619858_7524022_n.jpg
<prince-dari> Wow, that's pretty close. XD
<Aristeo> :d
<Aristeo> :3
<Mikey> yes that was crazy
<Mikey> that was a really cool venue too
<Mikey> it was like
<Mikey> just a basement
<Cqis> lol
<Mikey> I swear someone that worked there lives there
<prince-dari> I've seen one totally underground venue.
<prince-dari> That was pretty cool.
<Mikey> when I filmed for algernon cadwallader after snowing's set I was in the back standing on the back of a couch leaning against a mattress
<Mikey> and there were like bike parts scattered all over the place and before the venue they were serving homemade tacos or w/e
<SilverSonic> ;o
<prince-dari> Lol, wth.
<Ghosties> 4SIRSPRINKLES!
<Mikey> http://www.last.fm/music/Algernon+Cadwallader/+images/41850837
<Mikey> not from the same show but that's pretty much what it looked like
<Mikey> 6 foot tall teenage boys > small female that just wants to film
<Mikey> :C
<prince-dari> :o
<prince-dari> Filming must be difficult.
<Mikey> depends on the venue and the people
<Alucard> fuck
<prince-dari> Looks fun though.
<Mikey> I don't usually film every show I go to
<Alucard> I hate when I leave my scrollback up
<Archfiend> ._.
<Alucard> like a few hours
<Archfiend> lmao
<Mikey> I mostly film a band called me vs myself who i've made a couple videos for and I'm starting to film other local friends as they begin to play more shows
<Mikey> other than that it's just random whether I decide to or not
<sketch> grabbing and strumming are entirely different levels of articulation though
<AgnitioExMachina> Just discovered a precursor to Nintendo Wars
<sketch> so is manipulating a bow for the strings and strumming, lol
<AgnitioExMachina> They're still selling it too
<prince-dari> I'd give an arm to go and see CoB, that'd be so damn awesome.
<sketch> but it is interesting to think about
<AgnitioExMachina> http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/452/Battle+Isle+2.html
<Mikey> who
<cyrilthepony> strumming would be easier for the pony
<cyrilthepony> theoretically
<prince-dari> Children of Bodom.
<AgnitioExMachina> Looks great but I'm not buying
<Mikey> ah
<Umbreon> 12don't stare at me D:
<sketch> I guess strumming wouldn't be that hard.. managing the frets though? I guess no harder then on cello
*SilverSonic stares
<cyrilthepony> no, easier
<SilverSonic> .-.
<cyrilthepony> because you wouldn't have to be as precise with the fingerings
<cyrilthepony> cello and other non-fretted instruments require you to be RIGHT on the point in order to produce the in-tune note
<prince-dari> Are they too heavy for your taste?
<sketch> makes sense
<twentypercentcooler> hmm
<Mikey> yeahh from what I've heard
<sketch> so theoretically I suppose, yeah, easier
<Mikey> I listen to a lot of different things but that's not really my area
<prince-dari> Ah right.
<prince-dari> Rage Against The Machine, or Bullet For My Valentine?
<cyrilthepony> I have a slight obsession with wings, so my OCpony would have to be a pegasus, but I play bass guitar so that of course is part of it
<cyrilthepony> Thanks for the aid :)
<AgnitioExMachina> Fuck OC
<Mikey> if I had to choose an altogether favorite genre it would be late 90's/early 00's "emo"
<Mikey> nahh
<John316> well its like asking how rarity can get pruny hooves from staying in the bath too long
<cyrilthepony> ;_;
<dapples> good evening, equestria
<cyrilthepony> evenin
<cyrilthepony> true

<Mikey> these are my jams :P http://www.last.fm/user/Mikehsaur/library
<cyrilthepony> twas a funny joke tho
<dapples> just listened to the npr thingy
<dapples> blarg
<twentypercentcooler> ....
<cyrilthepony> I love that episode... oh there was an NPR thing?
<Fooby> All this media stuff isn't that big a deal.
<dapples> not angry, just annoyed that its once again the MOM'S BASEMENT jokes
<AgnitioExMachina> Yep, NPR bashing
<Fooby> That's how it is with all things internet-related
<twentypercentcooler> meh, haters gonna hate
<AgnitioExMachina> But it was probably a local affiliate
<DJMidli> fyck i know dapples
<Fooby> Anything ever. *shrug*
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes?
<dapples> I actually listen to npr more than any radio station, and i've always liked wait wait
<Ghosties> 4Sup?
<[zZz]ekeS> Looked that way from the transcript AgnitioExMachina
<SirSprinkles> 6Not much
<AgnitioExMachina> yep
<Mikey> or for alphabetical order http://www.last.fm/user/Mikehsaur/library?sortBy=name#p1
<dapples> certainly better than that stupid whatdya know program
<Ghosties> 4Cool
<prince-dari> Ok, thanks.
<DJMidli> It's either homophobia, reactionist THEY MUST BE PEODS, Moms basement jokes, Unemployment joke.
<Ghosties> 4So how do you think the stream went?
<AgnitioExMachina> dapples, relax, it's some local retards doing an opinion section
<Lambda> as for me, I like folk/indie rock sort of stuff
<AgnitioExMachina> Yep
<Ghosties> 4Earlier today, I mean
<SirSprinkles> 6Good, except for the LAG
<Mikey> same
<Ghosties> 4How was the lag in ST this time?
<Lambda> but I like tons of other music too
<John316> ah, I should go check out the EqD homepage for updates. brb
<Nightboomfer> Was I banned or did I have a bad internet connection because if I was banned then I am truly genuinely sorry and would somepony please tell me what I did wrong so I don't continue to do it?
<cyrilthepony> the unemplyment thing bothered me actually. I don't think I was tempted to quit my job to obsess over anything
<Lambda> that's just what I like the most
<Mikey> exactly haha
<AgnitioExMachina> Real NPR reporters actually know that there are more bizarre things that isn't worth bashing
*prince-dari spies ponies on Mikey's page.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was about as bad as after I had fixed it last time.
<cyrilthepony> Nightbooomfer: it was a netsplit not worries
<Ghosties> 4Man
<John316> chat was just glitched
<AgnitioExMachina> Night, it's the chat
<dapples> i'm not deeply offended or anything
<AgnitioExMachina> yep
<TurniBrony> What a shame.
<Lambda> you have pony music?
<Fooby> I'm more worried about the comments section about the NPR thing.
<Nightboomfer> Okie dokie loki
<Lambda> awesome!
<SirSprinkles> 6Though some ponies think it kinda added to the video, so that's funny.
<Fooby> Fon Shaolin's back. -.-
<Ghosties> 4Hey, it's Turni
<DJMidli> TBH the homophobia is aggrivating the heck out of me and shows how muche the USA has issues with gender identity. In canada we pretty much don't give a fuck about tomboys nor do we care about sensitive men.
<SirSprinkles> 6SUDDENLY TURNIBRONY OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE!
<dapples> its just obnoxious when things you like cross and one has to say something about the other
<Mikey> XD
<Fooby> I remember that guy back from the "Open Letter to the Brony Community" post.
<TurniBrony> Allways.
*John316 jane316
<Fooby> Guy's a crazy-good troll.
<Ghosties> 4So, Turni, do I dare ask if you're finally satisfied with how we run the BMN?
<DJMidli> Nightboomfer chat just had connection issues.
<dapples> i was talking to a friend recently about how ridiculous is it that girls can like transformers but guys can't like ponies
<Nightboomfer> I actually do have gender identity issues. It's completely unrelated to my pony love. and who is hating on us now?
<AgnitioExMachina> Which guy?
<TurniBrony> Do you?
<DJMidli> Nightboomfer NPR radio
<dapples> no one's hating on us, just the usual durr hurr nerds thing
<DuskBright> 0time for chat.
<Ghosties> 4...that's a good question, Sprinkles?
<AgnitioExMachina> I have no gender identification issues
<cyrilthepony> I'm pretty confident I'm a man, but hey, MLP has a great world and characters
<cyrilthepony> so
<cyrilthepony> *shrug*
<cyrilthepony> that and the art style is <3
<sketch> whoa whoa.. npr thing.. crazy... must go find
<AgnitioExMachina> I'm actually a pretty good example of a man liking a cutesy show
<Fooby> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/npr-bronies-and-great-and-powerful.html
*Jane316 is secure
<TurniBrony> I never really had a problem. Just had a problem with some of the movies. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Destroyerbaby> I'm pretty confident I'm a woman, but I'm not girly by any means, and I'm secure in that too.
<DJMidli> Nor do I, my girlfriend and friends know im a fan of the series. there response was OHU. because they know im quirky so it didn't surprise them
<Ghosties> 4Well, I'm glad that everybody is finally happy...to an extent
<Mikey> Your musical compatibility with KingLambda is Very High
<Mikey> Music you have in common includes MANSIONS, Aiden, Circa Survive, Anarbor and The Swellers.
<dapples> my fiancee teases me about it, but she doesn't really care
<TurniBrony> Actually went out and bought Starship Troopers afterwards because I really liked it.
<Mikey> I saw the swellers a month or two ago with bayside
<cyrilthepony> My girlfriend is okay with the idea
<Nightboomfer> I am gradually converting my friends to pony
<Lambda> Woah, cool
<prince-dari> People can think and say what they want about us. I couldn't care less.
<Mikey> ...in fact I've seen all listed bands live
<Mikey> ahahah
<Destroyerbaby> I got my boyfriend into MLP. And at least one of my friends.
<cyrilthepony> I'm not exactly the "manliest" guy anyway
<Lambda> I think I only have one song of theirs
<Destroyerbaby> F*ck stereotypical gender.
<AgnitioExMachina> I weight train fyi
<AgnitioExMachina> lol
<Destroyerbaby> Srsly.
<Ghosties> 4I have to say, I was thoroughly entertained the entire time I watched it and I hate Sci-Fi/Action combinations
<BiiiiigMacintosh> How's the saying go? "Love and tolerate the sh*t outta them."
<Nightboomfer> It's getting tougher to love and tolertate everyone...
<cyrilthepony> I actually want to wegith train
<cyrilthepony> I'm sick of my damn gut
<Destroyerbaby> It's always tought, boomfer
<dapples> i'm trying. its very tough
<Destroyerbaby> tough*
<AgnitioExMachina> cyril, you'd need more than just weight training btw
<dapples> i've spent my whole life convinced everyone is an asshole
<Destroyerbaby> But that's the point, kinda.
<AgnitioExMachina> Weight training only increases metabolism
<dapples> which is why this fandom appeals to me. i'm sick of being so negative
<AgnitioExMachina> aerobic exercise burns calories
<TurniBrony> Even if I'd still debate over that whole "picked as a B-movie" thing. But was too entranced by the chat.
<AgnitioExMachina> and fat
<Destroyerbaby> Negativity is more work
<cyrilthepony> Agnito: well if I weight train I'd shift my entire diet and stuff
<cyrilthepony> also, cardio is necessary
<AgnitioExMachina> But weight training only speeds up your digestion and shit
<Jane316> All i ever do is run
<SirSprinkles> 6I could see B-movie due to some of the acting, not much else.
<sketch> yeah, weight training will not really help with weight loss immedietely, it'll actually bulk you first
<AgnitioExMachina> No shit cardio is neccessary lol
<Jane316> for exercise
<cyrilthepony> I do the bodybuildling method of weight trainging
<cyrilthepony> so like
<cyrilthepony> yea
<AgnitioExMachina> sketch, which is one reason why I picked weight training
<Nightboomfer> The show has actually helped me evaluate how I see my friends and now I really do try to see the good in everything
<TurniBrony> I mean. It isn't much diffrent than your regular Hollywood blockbuster.
<Ghosties> 4It was pretty damn hammy
<Jane316> is running alone okay for exercise?
<Destroyerbaby> :)
<AgnitioExMachina> MANLY FUCKING SQUATS
<cyrilthepony> SQUATSSS
<sketch> lol
<cyrilthepony> oh god
<Destroyerbaby> Boomfer: I think that's awesome.
<AgnitioExMachina> HHHNNNNNGGGG
<Destroyerbaby> Agnitio: LOL\
<cyrilthepony> My equipment is in teh basement
<cyrilthepony> and like, I have to crall up after a good session
<sketch> yeah, if that's what you are after, for sure
<Destroyerbaby> Urgh, exercise.
<TurniBrony> And last time I checked. The "B" in B-Movie didn't stand for "blockbuster with a million dollar budget" :P
<cyrilthepony> for real
<AgnitioExMachina> I also haul wood
<cyrilthepony> *crawl
<SirSprinkles> 6Especially DAT DEATH SCENE
<AgnitioExMachina> Since I am in the middle of nowhere
<Ghosties> 4JOHNNY I'M DYING
<Destroyerbaby> I just eat healthy and walk everywhere, that's my exercise.
<AgnitioExMachina> more like a forest
<Ghosties> 4JOHNNY I'M DYING
<cyrilthepony> yea, that would be good
<Ghosties> 4JOHNNY
<cyrilthepony> except I don't
<Ghosties> 4I'M DYING
<cyrilthepony> so I need to like... burn calories
<SirSprinkles> 6AND IT FLEW REAL LOW
<sketch> but as far as weight management.. I used to run about 5-7 miles every few days.. key word.. used to
<Nightboomfer> I walk everythwere too. Not having a car has its advantages
<prince-dari> ^ I love you
<AgnitioExMachina> heh
<cyrilthepony> I aslso work at a bagel shop
<Mongoose> baagel
<Mongoose> bagel
<AgnitioExMachina> FREE BAGELS
<AgnitioExMachina> lol
<Mongoose> bageel
*Jane316 has a desk job and little time for exercise
<cyrilthepony> yes.
<sketch> and I swear.. you do that and you can eat anything you want.. as much of it.. all the time..a nd not gain anything
<Ghosties> 4That one scene made it B worthy in my opinion *nodnod*
<cyrilthepony> Free bagels
<Nightboomfer> I work at a place that sells cookies, caked, and brownies
<Destroyerbaby> Yup! Not paying for gas, for one.
<AgnitioExMachina> I know benefits lol'd
<Nightboomfer> I decorate cakes and stuff
<TurniBrony> The stream didn't do justice to the effects either. :P
<Destroyerbaby> Whhhhaaat? Sweet!
<Ridley> Huh.
<Nightboomfer> also free cookies
<Ridley> Hi.
<AgnitioExMachina> I do enjoy sweets every now and again
<prince-dari> And it flew real low...
<dapples> i could not work at a bagel place
<twentypercentcooler> bagellls
<AgnitioExMachina> Nothing wrong with that
<dapples> i would weigh a million pounds
<twentypercentcooler> haha
<Destroyerbaby> lol
<sketch> mmm bagels
<Mongoose> Bag Gel.
<Destroyerbaby> A million pounds vs. free bagels? Worth it.
<Nightboomfer> I am like Fluttershy with Pinkie Pie's job
<Mongoose> Still sound good?
<DuskBright> 0JOHNNY I'M DYING is best death scene
<dapples> nice mongoose
<Jane316> why do seagulls fly over the sea?
<Ridley> NEW TOPIC: Bronies In The Media
<twentypercentcooler> bagels with strawberry cream cheese, BAM\
<AgnitioExMachina> Jane, to get to the other side
<dapples> Community?
<AgnitioExMachina> dohoho
<Mongoose> I put my gel in this bag
<Destroyerbaby> Ridley, you missed when that WAS the topic :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Well EXCUUUUUUUUUUSE MEEEEEEEE for getting the HD version when it was the only one I could find.
<Jane316> Because if they flew over the bay they'd be bagulls
<Ridley> D'oh
<SirSprinkles> 6We don't pirate here.
<Destroyerbaby> lol
<Jane316> Bagels
<Ridley> Ah well. It sorta makes me a sad pony.
<TurniBrony> Yarr
<Destroyerbaby> I understand *hug*
<prince-dari> We don't?
<prince-dari> Ok.
<twentypercentcooler> haha
<DuskBright> 0I don't?
<AgnitioExMachina> baygulls
<cyrilthepony> I'
<AgnitioExMachina> silly
<Nightboomfer> Eventually, I think they'll get tired of it and we can continue in peace. After all, there are entire communities of adult male barbie doll collectors
<cyrilthepony> I'm like pinkie pie with pinkie pies job
<SirSprinkles> 6Not if we have the ability not to.
<Ridley> :3 Thanks.
<Destroyerbaby> But the thing is, journalism is full of crazytalk, and y'can't let it get you down/
<Jane316> yes
<cyrilthepony> except bagels
<Mongoose> Backgal
<Mongoose> Back gal
<Ghosties> 4YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE
<sketch> so, is this NPR thing like a "you should check this out" or is it a bunch of "huuurrr duuuur geeeeks" kinda thing?
<prince-dari> So you bought it?
<TurniBrony> It was really the lag that did it in. ;P
<Jane316> why were the little strawberries crying?
<SirSprinkles> 6It was via sites you sign up for.
<Jane316> Because they were in a jam
<Ridley> NPR probably wasn't either
<Fooby> http://www.npr.org/2011/06/18/137261565/bluff-the-listener
<SirSprinkles> 6The lag was because it was HD.
<Fooby> There's the transcript.
<cyrilthepony> not... loading
<cyrilthepony> argh
<AgnitioExMachina> I'm going to try and download this game
<AgnitioExMachina> http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/972/Gloriana.html
<TurniBrony> Hope you can find Dead Heat. Because one day...
<twentypercentcooler> I just lost a friend from childhood cause of my love for mlp, pretty awesome, you are close friends with a guy since the age of 7, and 12 years later, he finds out I like mlp, and he is like: Wow, you're pathetic, were not friends anymore
<AgnitioExMachina> It's a bunch of trashing, sketch
<twentypercentcooler> > . >
<AgnitioExMachina> I don't count it as real NPR reporting
<Fooby> Are you serious? D:
<Ghosties> 4Turni's all about that Dead Heat, I've seen him talk about it in almost every thread and stream XD
<Ridley> That's no good, twentypercentcooler
<cyrilthepony> twentypercentcooler: how shallow
<Ridley> Sprry dood
<Jane316> thats too bad
<TurniBrony> Allways.
<Nightboomfer> sadness... how could a friend of yours hate you for having a hobby
<AgnitioExMachina> twentypercent, just tell him that if he can't handle new ideas
<cyrilthepony> I'm sorry man
<Fooby> Your friend's just like Gilda. :l
<Jane316> *sad
<twentypercentcooler> yeah he raged on me for like 10 minutes then left
<AgnitioExMachina> he shouldn't even try new things
<cyrilthepony> >_>
<cyrilthepony> Did you spam him with ponies?
<TurniBrony> It's the best undead-buddy-action cop movie I've ever seen.
<cyrilthepony> that can annoy people
<Ridley> So once he's cooled off, make him watch
<twentypercentcooler> haha, nah
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways I'm charasmatic enough not to worry about that shit
<Nightboomfer> I don't see how your personal choice in hobbies has anything to do with him, or how it would make him rage *hugs*
<cyrilthepony> okay, well hope he cools off and doesn't keep being such a bucket
<AgnitioExMachina> And one less "friend", fine with me
<sketch> it is interesting to hate someone because of an isolated hobby.. and pretty weak
<AgnitioExMachina> got plenty of "friends"
<sketch> thanks for the transcript by the by
<Ghosties> 4undead buddy action cop movie?
<cyrilthepony> I'm too zany for people to care
<Shaico> lol u guys r forever alone
<Ghosties> 4So it's like Rush Hour...but with zombies?
<cyrilthepony> even my GF was like "and?"
*Jane316 doesn't worry about losing friends he doesn't have
<cyrilthepony> :P
<Ridley> Of course, you can always get new friends, Pinkie-Pie style.
<Fooby> sketch: Not a problem
<TurniBrony> Pfft. It's better than Rush Hour. :p
<twentypercentcooler> well, one thing I have realized, is that he tries to act like some big macho guy, and he always forced me to wear certain clothing and look a certain way when he and a few other friends went out places
<Ridley> Got a bag of flour sitting around? How about some rocks?
<Ghosties> 4Hey, Rush Hour was good
<twentypercentcooler> some big issue on his own self image, now he sees me as a threat to that I guess
<Nightboomfer> That really says a lot about him
<TurniBrony> Rush Hour didn't have Vincent Price.
<AgnitioExMachina> twenty, well looks like he had a self image problem, then
<cyrilthepony> >_>
<DJMidli> tbh If thats all it took for him to stop being friends with you. he wasn't a good friend to start with.
<Ridley> That's sad. He NEEDS some friendship
<cyrilthepony> sorry to be mean, but he sounds like a tool
<prince-dari> But it had Jackie Chan.
<dapples> no offense to your friend, but honestly f that guy
<prince-dari> :P
<cyrilthepony> un tool him
<Ghosties> 4>doesn't know who Vincent Price is
<TurniBrony> Or undead.
<twentypercentcooler> lol
<twentypercentcooler> yeah
<DJMidli> I have friends who are working for politicians and they didn't give a fuck when i told them i liked MLP.
<Fooby> Like I said:
<Fooby> Such a Gilda
<AgnitioExMachina> Nah, he's not confident in his manhood
<AgnitioExMachina> That's basically it
<dapples> i understand not getting it
<Ghosties> 4And yeah, it had the smiling Jackie Chan who just wants no trouble from anyone
<AgnitioExMachina> He's not straight enough
<Ridley> -snrk- manhood
<DJMidli> well they found it odd and went "lol serious?" but yeah
<Mongoose> lol
<AgnitioExMachina> To understand being secure in it
<dapples> but actively rejecting your friendship because of it, that's nonsense
<Jane316> maidenhood?
<cyrilthepony> right
<TurniBrony> In a groundbreaking role.
<Ridley> It'll die down!
<Ridley> I hope...
<cyrilthepony> maidenhood makes me think of bad fanfics I read when I was younger
<cyrilthepony> oh boy
<DuskBright> wait.... what movie are we talking about?
<AgnitioExMachina> I can joke about being a faggot but I know what I am and still get lolz
<twentypercentcooler> what fails is that another friend of mine (also good friends with thi guy) is fine with me watching mlp, BUT....Around him, he sides with tool friend and joins in the rage, > . >
<Ghosties> 4Rush Hour
<AgnitioExMachina> lol twenty, you in middle school?
<TurniBrony> But yeah, I liked Rush Hour.
<AgnitioExMachina> or some shit? lol
<Jane316> the difference is ide
<Archfiend> SILVERSONIC
<twentypercentcooler> Im in College bro, XD
<Jane316> from man
*Ascendant slaps Ray
<AgnitioExMachina> I'm in college too brah
<Ghosties> 4But hey, at least we get to see Se7en
<twentypercentcooler> I know right? childish behavior on their part
<Ridley> Dangit, I can't get sucked into staying awake any longer!
<Ghosties> 4next week
<Fooby> That's ridiculous :l
<Destroyerbaby> Yes you can Ridley
<AgnitioExMachina> But I don't know about any guys that act like they're in middle school
<prince-dari> Which I hadn't heard of until today, lol.
<AgnitioExMachina> Highschool maybe
<Jane316> joooin usssss
<AgnitioExMachina> Fuckers text in class lol
<cyrilthepony> College eh?
<dapples> i love how your friend is basically gilda
<dapples> YOU'RE DORKING UP THE SKY TWENTYPERCENT
<twentypercentcooler> EXACTLY
<Destroyerbaby> I don't even have middle school where I'm from lol
<AgnitioExMachina> But the fuck do I care?
<Fooby> I've gotten lucky so far. Someone saw my Fluttershy background on my phone and said "...really? REALLY!?"
<Ridley> Love to all, though I know you little. G'night bronies! I'm sorry I stayed away for a month
<TurniBrony> Se7en is good.
<AgnitioExMachina> It's their problems
<Fooby> "Just... just... why?"
<AgnitioExMachina> see ya Ridley
<Fooby> And I said "why not?"
<prince-dari> Still, I bet if I realed off "MUST SEE" films for long enough, you guys wouldn't have seen them all. :P
<Fooby> And then we've stopped discussing it since.
<dapples> adios ridley
<Destroyerbaby> Bye Ridley!
<Nightmare_Moon> And then there was new Nightmare Moon art http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25866

<twentypercentcooler> Today was awesome though, I had a punch of MLP art drawings with me at church, and everyone thought it was awesome and there was not one negative comment on me liking mlp, so YAY
<TurniBrony> Try us I guess.
<twentypercentcooler> XD
<prince-dari> I didn't have a list of movies in mind.
<Destroyerbaby> I wish I could go to the San Diego con
<Nightboomfer> I have a fiend who has said he specifically hates "cute girly things" but he still loves me and invites me to stuff. I spam ponies sometimes as a joke to annoy him, but he has no problem with me as a person. That's how I know he's my real friend
<Ghosties> 4>_<

<Destroyerbaby> ahh
<Lambda> from people I haven't seen since I was tiny
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways I also know guys who've volunteered at Comicon and shit
<AgnitioExMachina> I've never gone to it though
<Destroyerbaby> I'll be going to the FanExpo in Toronto in August, but that's about it.

<AgnitioExMachina> TOLERATE being the keyword
<Nightboomfer> just found this out

<Destroyerbaby> I adore homosexuals.
<Mikey> I don't know why there's such a big deal about people getting harrassed on facebook by their schoolmates...IF THEY'RE BEING RUDE JUST DEFRIEND THEM GOSH DON'T BE A PUSSY ABOUT IT
<TurniBrony> Pass
<sketch> girls who like ponies? <- lol they happen
<Destroyerbaby> But then, I'm biased
<Nightboomfer> I figured you'd want to know
<prince-dari> You've never seen it?
<lolwutman> e
<prince-dari> Wow.
<Lambda> yeah
<lolwutman> hey guise
<Ghosties> 4I've seen it
<twentypercentcooler> HAI GUIZE
<cyrilthepony> Oddly enough, my girlfriend is not a fan
<cyrilthepony> then again she's not huge into cartoons
<TurniBrony> I'm not big on martial arts flicks. :P
<Destroyerbaby> hi lolwutman
<dapples> mine either, cyril
<AgnitioExMachina> Although I support equal rights for those of a...different sexual preference
<prince-dari> But...BRUCE LEE!
<cyrilthepony> Fancy that!
<AgnitioExMachina> I wouldn't want to live with one
<Nightboomfer> ...yay
<AgnitioExMachina> Just me.
<Destroyerbaby> It's an acquired taste - cartoons I mean
<Nightboomfer> :(
<cyrilthepony> or a taste from childhood
<prince-dari> Groundhog Day
<sketch> my wife is (and don't think I'm creepy old by that statment, we are both in our 20's
<Jane316> where does asexuality fit in?
<TurniBrony> Yes.
<Ghosties> 4Nope
<Lambda> did I ever tell you about the time when I was going through deleting all my friends who I didn't even know, and then one of them adds me again and sends me a message "weren't we friends on here once?"
<Destroyerbaby> your wife is what? a fan?
<Mikey> B B B BUT SHES THREATENING TO HAVE S3X W/ MY BF THAT I'VE BEEN GOING OUT WITH 4 1 WEEK AND WE'RE MEANT TO BE WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO???? stop being a whiny little bitch and get over it?
<sketch> >>is a fan that is
<sketch> indeed
<lolwutman> asexuality-not intrested in fucking at all
<Mikey> XD no you didn't
<AgnitioExMachina> eh?
<dapples> i have friends like that
<Jean316> right
<TurniBrony> You should see it. It's really good.
<Balloons> ..
<AgnitioExMachina> I'm somewhat asexual
<cyrilthepony> sketch, heh
<Lambda> XD exactly
<prince-dari> Yeah, it's good.
<lolwutman> :P
<AgnitioExMachina> Just not that great
<cyrilthepony> I used to think I was asexual
<Destroyerbaby> Well Agnitio, I'd rather tolerate/somewhat support than hate
<DuskBright> Ghostbusters.
<Lambda> but yeah, she was a classmate of mine who I never really talked to much
<dapples> i don't get it, but if I weren't in a committed relationship i'd probably be a huge slut
<Ghosties> 4Seen it
<Destroyerbaby> asexuality is crap.
<AgnitioExMachina> Yeah, I tolerate and somewhat support
<prince-dari> Seen that.
<TurniBrony> *cough*
<DuskBright> who hasn't
<sketch> amusingly enough, I'm bisexual, or was before I was married.. I suppose I'm functionally straight now
<rememberme> if you are going to mencin asexuality go to after dark
<Mikey> SHE'S CALLING ME MEAN THINGS AND I'M INCAPABLE OF CLICKING THE "UNFRIEND" OR THE "BLOCK" BUTTON BECAUSE I'M STUUUUPID
<TurniBrony> Erm. Me.
<prince-dari> You serious Turni?
<Destroyerbaby> lol
<sketch> asexuality is.. interesting to me
<prince-dari> NO WAY! O_o
<TurniBrony> Eyup.
<sketch> in an academic way
<DuskBright> oh good lord
<Lambda> or another translation
<DuskBright> you have to watch it!
<Nightboomfer> I'm pansexual. Like Jack Harkness level.
<Lambda> I JUST WANT EVERYONE'S ATTENTION
<lolwutman> i support all sexualities(striaght here)
<Jean316> this topic is now after dark?
<Ghosties> 4Actually, I've only seen snippets of it
<Mikey> yeah
<dapples> i don't really understand pansexuality? explain?
<Mikey> DEFEND ME
<DuskBright> think of the gigantic twinkies!
<TurniBrony> See?
<sketch> lol "look at that.. it's beautiful." "jack... that's a poodle"
<prince-dari> What?
<Mongoose> not really
<Mikey> BE AT MY EVERY BECK AND CALL PLEASE :'(((((
<prince-dari> O__________________o
<Destroyerbaby> pansexuality = attraction/potential to love any gender
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways I'm about to try the game Gloriana on DosBox
<Mongoose> they are not talking about detil
<DuskBright> lol
<dapples> how is that different than bisexuality?
<lolwutman> isn't that bisexuality?
<Mikey> hey so
<Mongoose> detail
<AgnitioExMachina> Pan such a crazy goddess
<Nightboomfer> I like boys, girls, gender-fluid, transgender, genderqueer, intersexed
<cyrilthepony> pansexuality..... _>
<Nightboomfer> etc
<Jean316> Ponies?
<Mikey> on these question answer things that this guy put on your page
<prince-dari> The film is older than me and I've seen it.
<Ghosties> 4Dan's been in better films
<Balloons> New topic Ponies.
<Ghosties> 4Akroyd
<Mikey> should I put a comment on one of them going BILLY LUV CHAS
<Ghosties> 4Steroids
<Ghosties> 4guy
<Ghosties> 4man
<Mikey> just to see what happens
<Ghosties> 4person
<AgnitioExMachina> Yep
<Fooby> Hi there Balloons
<Mongoose> uhhhh
<Destroyerbaby> whereas nightboomfer has it right in that pan is more than just biary
<Destroyerbaby> binary*
<Lambda> XD
<Mongoose> Yeah lets talk about ponies
<TurniBrony> Like Trading Places?
<Mikey> or is that one of your actual friends
<Balloons> Hello Fooby
<Lambda> I just deleted them all
<Lambda> :P
<AgnitioExMachina> Discuss Roman and Greek gods
<Mikey> oh XD
<sketch> sooo yes, ponies
<Jean316> so ponies are pony-rific
<cyrilthepony> Lets float
<Lambda> this guy actually is
<lolwutman> wat
<Ghosties> 4Exactly, AND the one movie with David Spade
<twentypercentcooler> ponies yay
<Lambda> his name isn't billy though
<lolwutman> PRIMUS FTW
<Ghosties> 4Tommy Boy
<twentypercentcooler> so heres something I wonder
<Destroyerbaby> lol alright then
<DJMidli> cyrilthepony mine either, but she is more tv sitcoms then cartoons. although she wants me to take her to an anime convention badly xD
<dapples> did I get muted?
<sketch> opinions on the hardest pony to draw?
<Lambda> he was always a... troublemaker
<Jean316> pony-tastic
<Mikey> B00LLY
<TurniBrony> Haven't seen that.
<sketch> I'm curious on that one actually
<twentypercentcooler> Fluttershy, her parents named her fluttershy, but.....
<sketch> 'cause Rainbow dash gives me trouble
<twentypercentcooler> what if she wasnt shy?
<Lambda> I wonder if he's hiding from someone so's using a different name
<twentypercentcooler> did her parents somehow know she would be shy?
<Destroyerbaby> Celestia is the hardest I think.
<cyrilthepony> DJMidli hahaa! that's hilarious to me. My GF rather stay away from my convensions haha
<Mikey> troll account
<Mikey> :P
<twentypercentcooler> What if they named her flutterbold, lol
<sketch> ah, that would be a hard one, could agree there Destroyer
<Lambda> Haha, or maybe that too
<Nightboomfer> Maybe they thought she'd be a fluttershy, or wanted her name to rhyme with butterfly
<sketch> never attempted it (yet) I'm sure it'll be a pain
<Lambda> I dunno though
<Jean316> it was a self fulfilling proficy
<twentypercentcooler> hmmm
<DJMidli> cyrilthepony oh yeah she's interested in the nerd subculture . she wants me to take her to the anime store and to a rave :P
<Lambda> he also wasn't always the brightest bulb...
<cyrilthepony> ncie
<cyrilthepony> :3
<TurniBrony> I'll get around to Ghostbusters sometime, I promise. ;P
<cyrilthepony> *nice
<Nightboomfer> *shuttefly I mean
<Lambda> but deep down he was a good guy
<lolwutman> maybe they get a unicorn to see le future for every childpony
<DJMidli> cyrilthepony im gonna kill two birds and invite her to the convention im spinning at xD
<Fooby> I want to go to a rave some day
<Lambda> even if he did do dumb things sometimes
<sketch> it is interesting that their names are sorta prophetic
<Nightboomfer> Rainbow Dash always dresses in style!
<prince-dari> Never seen Trading Places.
<lolwutman> OH GOD NOT G1
<prince-dari> Or Tommy Boy.
<DJMidli> Fooby you should they are loads of fun :3
<twentypercentcooler> I am a glowsticker but have never been to a rave, haha
<Ghosties> 4I won't promise. I tried playing the Ghostbusters game and I disliked it
<sketch> makes me wonder if they don't get their names until thier personality develops
<cyrilthepony> Djmidli: sweet! I was wondering if you were a legit DJ or not haha
<Jean316> your new pony name is... DiesHorribly
<prince-dari> But it's a classic.
<prince-dari> :P
<Mikey> why are teenagers stupid
<Ghosties> 4The Ghostbusters game is a classic? Has it only been out for about 2 years?
<cyrilthepony> I wish Solo shows were easier for non-djs :<
<prince-dari> No, the film.
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<TurniBrony> >Implying games based on movies are any good
<Ghosties> 4Meh
<Lambda> because they have too many hormones and if they don't know how to control them it ends up killing their brain
<Destroyerbaby> Jean, that's kind of a hilarious name in it's implications.
<Fooby> ...does that say "Not" Spike or "Hot" Spike?
<Ghosties> 4>goes off to find a list of movie-based games
<lolwutman> im a dj, but not rly that famous
<Mikey> I'll actually rephrase that
<Nightboomfer> I could see how her parents would name her Rainbow Dash after seeting her mane
<TurniBrony> Besides Jurrasic Park.
*Jean316 stole the name from the comic Goblins
<Destroyerbaby> Kinda hard to be a famous dj.
<lolwutman> eyup
<Nightboomfer> and Twilight Sparkle is probably named after her mother
<lolwutman> eyup
<Destroyerbaby> Competition and whatnot.
<DJMidli> cyrilthepony I am indeed a legit DJ. i spin for anime conventions. http://www.megaupload.com/?d=V80ZM7TF
<mib_5nx97u> lol
<Mikey> why are teenage girls so stupid that they think everyone is going to treat them like a princess and they're worried about being alone forever if they're not with someone at age 16
<mib_5nx97u> the genesis one?
<Mikey> why
<Mikey> why are they all stupid
<TurniBrony> Yup
<mib_5nx97u> i actually like playing as the raptor
<mib_5nx97u> it was awsome
<lolwutman> now imma wondering if i should change my stage name to vinyl scratch
<Ghosties> 4SAw
<Ghosties> 4Saw
<Lambda> yeah, in that case I never knew
<twentypercentcooler> legaly?
<cyrilthepony> DJmidli: Nice, cool beans :)
<Nightboomfer> Which makes me wonder if Twilight Sparkle's dad is named "Sparkle" or som ething
<twentypercentcooler> or nick
<mib_5nx97u> have you played the sequel to that game? it's really wierd
<Ghosties> 4was fun, I actually really enjoyed Saw
<Lambda> teenagers always confused me in that way
<mib_5nx97u> and you can double jump...
<Fooby> I don't think it's a last-name situation.
<lolwutman> *high fives DJmidli*
<Lambda> I was the forever alone type back then
<TurniBrony> Sequal was really fun too.
*Mikey is reading dumb little teenage girl tumblr blogs about how awful their life is because they don't have a boyfriend that will sacrifice fucking EVERYTHING for them
<twentypercentcooler> why does Rarity have no last name? haha
<Lambda> but nobody ever knew because I never talked about it or whined about it
<Ghosties> 4Oh, and Goldeneye
<mib_5nx97u> yeah
<Ghosties> 4Goldeneye is the classic exampl.e
<twentypercentcooler> or secondary name, whatever
<Ghosties> 4*example
<cyrilthepony> Cuz she's too rare
*DJMidli brohoofs lolwutman
<Mikey> I WANT MY BF 2 GIVE ME HIS COAT IN -20 DEGREE WEATHER
<cyrilthepony> hoihoihoihoih
<mib_5nx97u> i also like agent under fire
<twentypercentcooler> haha
<TurniBrony> I wouldn't know.
<mib_5nx97u> =(
<Flamester> 3 syable rule.
<Jean316> maybe she does but never mentions it outside of legal documents
<Mikey> yeah I'm like that lambda, I don't normally whine about it
<Mikey> except to you guys
<DJMidli> I'm also the guy who did the MLP:FiM panel at Anime North ^^
<Fooby> Would the same be said of Fluttershy or Applejack?
<Mikey> b/c you guys are my bffs
<twentypercentcooler> ohhh
<Ghosties> 4Eh, I didn't like Goldeneye either
<twentypercentcooler> true
<prince-dari> How many examples does it take to exceed "the exception that proves the rule"?
<lolwutman> cool
<Lambda> :D
<Nightboomfer> Applejack Apple?
<Lambda> :D at being your bff
<Ghosties> 4As many as needed?
<twentypercentcooler> oh wait, thats right
<mib_5nx97u> infinite
<Fooby> They never officially say that.
<TurniBrony> Atleast 9000
<lolwutman> MLP is definitely not popular where im at
<prince-dari> Nice and specific.
<twentypercentcooler> well, apple family, apparently
<lolwutman> so far, i only know 3 other bronies in my country
<mib_5nx97u> or extreemly vauge
<Destroyerbaby> Anime north! No shit.
<Mikey> :P
<Lambda> not at you feeling like I used to
<Destroyerbaby> I keep wishing I'd gone to that.
<DJMidli> eyyup
<Mikey> yeah I know
<Lambda> :P
<TurniBrony> Starship Trooper had a game based on it.
<lolwutman> not a big anime fan, but okay
<TurniBrony> Halo. ;P
<Lambda> I may be derpy but I'm not insensitive
<Lambda> :P
<Mikey> XD
<Lambda> the derpiness comes with being a dude
<Lambda> we're all a bit dumb
<DJMidli> more netsplits?
<Destroyerbaby> I live about 45 minutes outside of Toronto, but I'm not into anime, so this is a problem lol.
<Ghosties> 4Hah, Halo
<prince-dari> Emotional depth of a teaspoon.
<mib_5nx97u> i love halo
<Lambda> yep
<Jean316> yes netsplits
<Lambda> :P
*prince-dari remembers that line from Harry Potter. XD

<Ghosties> 4Eh, strokes for different folks
<Jean316> will MLP be at CCI?
<Destroyerbaby> Ah well, there will be other T.O. meets.

<TurniBrony> Strokes for diffrent folks. That's what she said.
<mib_5nx97u> >_>
<Mikey> it's like SHUT UP YOU'RE STUPID
<prince-dari> Of course I can't without an Xbox.
<Lambda> with guys, we're either hungry, mad, or thinking about some stupid trivial thing
<mib_5nx97u> yeah that'll do it prince
<Ghosties> 4There actually was a Starship Troopers game XD

<Lambda> *_*
<Destroyerbaby> What's that?
<Lambda> sideways smiley face!
<Shaico> the ending of L.A. Noire
<Shaico> Finally

<Mikey> so now with all the girls wearing their stupid fake frames I gotta hope I don't look stupid with my REAL glasses that I ACTUALLY NEED
<Lambda> im uriginul
<DJMidli> yep
<Jean316> hahaha
<mib_5nx97u> and the general slipping of the finger
<mib_5nx97u> transitioning
<Jean316> your mind is a silly place
<Destroyerbaby> My cousin lives right in the middle of where it happened
<Destroyerbaby> Mine certainly is
<mib_5nx97u> and dragging finger across the keyboard once in a while

<Nightboomfer> good luck\
<Destroyerbaby> Good luck lolwut!

<Mikey> XD
<Destroyerbaby> Heh, chances would be slim anyway

<DJMidli> K
<DJMidli> let me rephrase that
<Jean316> what is vamp?
<Lambda> oh I know why my dog was doing that
<Nightboomfer> I'm getting Flutter/Twilight. More pockets!
<Destroyerbaby> Twilight is.... I love her, but she's a bit too normal for me to like her best.
<Nightboomfer> Secret but fun
<DJMidli> "Im a huge TWILIGHT SPARKLE, the purple pony from MLP FiM series..fan"
<Lambda> "Bitch, I'm trying t sleep, turn your music off!"
<DJMidli> is that better Kiniest
<Lambda> that's what he was thinking
<prince-dari> "Mr. BURBANK: They say they love the show for its excellent animation and subtle references to that other hallmark of high school celibacy, "Dungeons and Dragons.""
<Mikey> XD
<mib_5nx97u> lol
<Kiniest> Sure.
<Jean316> purple is best color Donatello
<mib_5nx97u> yeah
<Kiniest> Whattteeeeeeeeeeever you say.
<Nightboomfer> I don't even associate the word Twilight with vampires anymore
<Jean316> does machines
<Kiniest> Wait...
<mib_5nx97u> i was just listening to it
<Nightboomfer> Rainbow Dash is cool but rude
<Kiniest> So this show cured you of that?
<prince-dari> It has references to Dungeons and Dragons (I'm only vaguely aware of what that is, some kind of board game?)?
<Destroyerbaby> If so: YAY
<Nightboomfer> Pinkie Pie is a party dude
<Jean316> pinkie pie is a
<mib_5nx97u> not sure at all
<Jean316> ninja'd
<mib_5nx97u> i was questioning it too
<Nightboomfer> it did. This show is the best thing to happen to vampires in a while
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Destroyerbaby> God I hate the twilight series.
<Destroyerbaby> So, so much.
<Kiniest> Pinkie Pie first came off as a normal overly excited cartoon character
<Jean316> Fluttershy /Rarity leads?
<Kiniest> And my perspective changed.
<Mikey> there's also those teenage girls who say stuff like
<prince-dari> Ah well, what did I expect from media? XD
<Kiniest> Did anyone have an unfair idea of Rena Ryugu from Higurashi at one point?
<Nightboomfer> Magic Friendship Little Ponies, Magic Friendship Little Ponies, Heroes on four hooves, Pony power
<mib_5nx97u> yeah, its unfortunate that bronies are easy to make fun of =(
<Mikey> "YOURE TOO YOUNG TO THINK THINGS WONT BE OKAY" even though they're FUCKING TEENAGERS NOT GRANDPARENTS and then the next thing they talk about how awful everything in their life is
<prince-dari> Meh, who cares.
<Jean316> nope always thought they were ALL being manipulated
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> hypocrites
<Kiniest> I thought Rena was a normal yandere.
<Jean316> but did not suspect alien virus
<TurniBrony> I care
<mib_5nx97u> me too
<mib_5nx97u> it's kinda hurtful
<TurniBrony> Ok, not really.
<mib_5nx97u> kinda though
<Jean316> grammar bad now that sleepy
<Kiniest> I'm about to post the best song in the world.
<TurniBrony> FOX NEWS
<mib_5nx97u> i just people would actually be informed abotu it
<Destroyerbaby> I'm ready to be impressed
<mib_5nx97u> instead of the love-to-hate thing
<sketch> Indeed
<prince-dari> I'm more on the side of "and not a single fuck was given that day".
*Jean316 uses the power of HEART
<mib_5nx97u> ah
<Kiniest> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpWfAiz1RC0
*Kiniest runs
*Jean316 removes the R from his power

<Nightmare_Moon> I've heard TROT.... 40 times today?
<Kiniest> Oh god

<Kiniest> Um, I'm going to not get hit or scolded
<Nightmare_Moon> I must be going mad!!

<Nightboomfer> This...can't be serious
<DJMidli> its serious
<TurniBrony> Nah. I'm just kidding. :P Never played D&D.
<DJMidli> its basically where the tween music is going
<Lambda> I just unfriended someone who is guilty of a lot of the stuff we were talking about and it was annoying me
<sketch> I don't think it's a parody.. I hoped to god it was at first
<DJMidli> which means when these tweens grow up
<TurniBrony> Really like Baldurs Gate tho.
<DJMidli> OH GOD
<Fluttershy_RP> ...

<Ghosties> 4I am currently playing Doom II though
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, it's a tabletop game where the world is basically as controllable and adaptable as the DM wants it to be.
<TurniBrony> But I know that you can cast Magic Missile at The Darkness.

<Lambda> makes no sense to me

<Lambda> Is it bad that when I see muscular guys I instantly think "what a douche"? http://tosh.comedycentral.com/blog/files/2010/11/i-like-turtles.jpg
<Ghosties> 4So yeah, Turni reminded me of that PMV
<Mikey> uh oh one of my friends just sent out she apparently broke her nose tonight at that show :CCC
<Mikey> um that depends
<Lambda> D:
<TurniBrony> Saw one with FF1 characters.
<Fluttershy_RP> It's not a bad song, I was just in a joking mood with Devin Fox, this is a good one.
<Mikey> that guy does look like a douche
<Mikey> but not all big dudes are dbags
<Lambda> maybe not always
<Lambda> but I did for him
<Lambda> no they aren't
<Lambda> I just think it for guys that look like that guy
<Mikey> yeahh
<DJMidli> John316 I mentioned that it reminds me of Jean Michele Jarre and Yellow Magic Orchestra..some of the first pioneers of Electronic Music
<Ghosties> 4Got a question, anybody like Duke Nukem?
<John316> ah cool
<NightSeas> 12Hello SheenaFox
<Destroyerbaby> And I mentioned I wasn't indie enough to enjoy it ;)
<SheenaFox> hi NightSeas
<TurniBrony> Yes.
<prince-dari> Why does he look like a douche? O_o
<SheenaFox> How goes the day? |D
<SheenaFox> Or...night

<Lambda> I don't even know
<Lambda> but something about him does
<Ghosties> 4Trust me, just watch it
<Lambda> I can't place it
<prince-dari> I prefer not to judge people till I talk to them.
<prince-dari> I know a couple of Fluttershy guys who are massively tall and quite athletic.
<DJMidli> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk6o4GWFIV8 Yellow Magic Orchestra - Rydeen
<TurniBrony> Oh lord
<Mikey> I'm like you most of the time dari but you can't always help but judge people on appearance sometimes even if your opinion changes later on
<Lambda> yeah
<DuskBright> deskslam. dangus interwebs
<Mikey> like I know at least 50% of people that see me are probably like
<Mikey> "what a blind hipster douche"
<John316> WELP. Its 2AM here. I best be off to sleep iffin I'mma gonna go to Church in the morning or something
<Fluttershy_RP> The storm is ending!
<Destroyerbaby> Yay!
<Ghosties> 4See? Pretty awesome huh?
<John316> later folks
<Mikey> like a few weeks ago I was in mcdonalds and this grown man with his kids started laughing at me and he said IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU??? across the whole room and everyone turned
<Nightboomfer> byebye
<DuskBright> Argh. My internet makes me not know what's happening
<DuskBright> I like original duke
<DuskBright> and duke 3D
<DuskBright> oh my
<Destroyerbaby> It's 3 am here, I should probably do the same in a few
<Mikey> I was pissed
<Lambda> I try not to judge people without knowing them, but with some people I just can't help it
<NightSeas> 12Good ^^
<Nightboomfer> it's 3 am here. I am going to enjoy Luna's beautiful night
<Mikey> people question it all the time and I don't really care but you don't have to be a dick about it honestly
<Fluttershy_RP> It's 2 AM, but I'm waiting for the storm to be gone.
<DJMidli> ^^^^
<DJMidli> make sure luna feels loved.
<Destroyerbaby> Yay night!
<Lambda> I think with that picture I posted earlier he just has an air of cockiness about him
<Mikey> exactly
<NightSeas> 12Been drawing a lot of art
<Ghosties> 4It's Duke Nukem singing the Ducktales theme song!
<Fluttershy_RP> DJ, did that YTP make you feel better?
<Destroyerbaby> I do love my sleep, but we had such a pretty moon recently...
<DuskBright> Jon St. John?
<TurniBrony> It was something.
<NightSeas> 12Most of it has been fail art though XD
<Nightboomfer> The summer sun celebration's in 2 days anywya
<Destroyerbaby> What's happening for that?
<Nightboomfer> (Aka the summer solstice)
<Ghosties> 4That actually wasn't Jon St. John, but some guy who used to visit the fightingamphibians site
<DJMidli> Fluttershy_RP mildly.
<Destroyerbaby> I meant pony-wise, if there were any events plannedor anything
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> If you say so.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Ray> 02There, Fixed.
<Ray> 02now z-z
<Fluttershy_RP> Good, because he made a 2-3 minute video of Justin Bieber.
<SilverSonic> D;
<Fooby> :v
<SilverSonic> nuu
*SilverSonic huggles Ray goodnight
<NightSeas> 12And you, Sheena?
<SilverSonic> Nighty Night Ray~
*Ray||ZzZzZ hugs back
<SheenaFox> Pretty good
<Nightboomfer> I dunno. If I had more Brony/Pagan friends I'd plan a party.ritual
<DuskBright> why do you hate me internet?
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02Night~ ^^
<DuskBright> why?
<Ghosties> 4People heard his voice and everyone unanimously thought that it was amazing he sounded just like Duke. So what did they do? Ask him to sing the theme song from Ducktales
<Fooby> ...speaking of Bieber, has anyone done a Bieber PMV?
<Fooby> I'm afriad to look
<Fooby> afraid*
<DuskBright> I think I might be in teamspeak with that person
<Destroyerbaby> Pony pagans. Now there's a thought.
<[zZz]ekeS> Baby, baby, baby ooooh
<DJMidli> Love the night, it makes luna happy: http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=Luna+love+the+night#/d3h2fbc
<Lambda> Mikey, that's horrible
<Lambda> I would've punched that guy in the face
<Nightboomfer> I know like 1 or 2, but they live a bit aways from me
<Lambda> if he said that about me
<TurniBrony> Fightingamphibians.
<Mikey> yeah well
<Nightboomfer> the whole love and tolerance thing goes really well with paganism
<Fluttershy_RP> Well.
<Mikey> big black man vs me
<TurniBrony> I get it
<Lambda> oh
<Mikey> who do you think would win
<Ghosties> 4:P
<DuskBright> lol
<prince-dari> Also, I hope you told that guy that he was a sad old man who should go and wallow in his own pitiful existence before he gets too old and fat, and dies miserable and alone when no one loves him.
<NightSeas> 12Good night Ray :3
<Fluttershy_RP> DJMidli, does a certain hate for JB need to be satisfied?
<Lambda> yeah, if it were a bigg guy I would've been too afraid to
<Lambda> :P
<TurniBrony> Is this Battletoads?
<Destroyerbaby> Theoretically it goes well with a lot of religions. It's in practice where things go awry.
<prince-dari> If he hit you, he would be going to jail.
<Mikey> I almost felt like pulling the race card though but I knew it was wrong so I didn't @___@;
<prince-dari> Room full of witnesses.
<Mikey> either way
<Lambda> he was a jerkface either way
<Lambda> another reason I like small towns
<Destroyerbaby> JB?
<Lambda> people are USUALLY nicer than that guy
<Lambda> until rumors come around
<Mikey> yeahh
<Lambda> rumors spread like... something that spreads
<Mikey> mostly people are nicer about it if they ask
<Mikey> one of my friends is kind of rude about it though
<Mikey> but I'm too nice to tell him to stop it
<DJMidli> DAT SETUP... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxqEv-Rcx0&feature=related
<Ghosties> 4Fightingamphibians is a pun for Battletoads, yes
<Ghosties> 4I've only been to the site once, though
<TurniBrony> Shoulda gone with CombatAmphibians tho.
<Lambda> the worst I ever get is occassionaly I hear people whispering "Is he SERIOUSLY wearing a Star Wars/Pokemon t-shirt?"
<Ghosties> 4Maybe, but I doubt they'd change it now
<Mikey> XD
<DJMidli> DJMidli yes. the song needs to be done in a aggro dubstep tone with a voice clip of "STFU" mixed in
<Nightboomfer> and know I know what the Katyanagi twins' act in Scott Pilgrim was based off of
<Mikey> that's so normal around here
<Lambda> but when I hear that I feel like this...
<Nightboomfer> *now
<Lambda> http://bdadv.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/haters_gonna_hate_10.jpg
<Nightboomfer> <---Dork
<Destroyerbaby> That's the thing I really miss in older stuff: BASS
<Mikey> XD
<Lambda> my sister hates my Pokemon obsession
<Mikey> :C
<Lambda> "Embarrasses her"\
<Mikey> oh that reminds me
<DJMidli> aye
<prince-dari> When they make the MLP shirts in men's sizes that'll be me. XD
<Mikey> are you gonna collect the pokemon toys from mcdonalds?
<Lambda> it's like pfft, what I like shouldn't reflect on you
<Lambda> Yes!
<Lambda> when does that start?
<TurniBrony> Also. You gaiz
<Lambda> did it already?
<Mikey> it's already started
<Ghosties> 4What
<Lambda> Sweet!
<Lambda> McDonald's tomorrow it is
<TurniBrony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jus4GsEkSIQ
<Mikey> it began friday here, at least, it might be different for you
<Lambda> guess what!
<Mikey> so far I have pikachu and reshiram
<Mikey> what
<Lambda> I watched Pokemon this morning on TV?
<Ghosties> 4Of course, how did I not see this coming :/
<Lambda> :D
<Mikey> oh lol I did too
<Mikey> the new series?
<Lambda> the B&W season is actually pretty good from what I saw
<TurniBrony> It was bound to happen eventually.
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> I saw the Snivy episode :D
<Mikey> yeah I guess
<Ghosties> 4Bigolo
<Ghosties> 4Detective
<Ghosties> 4Bigolo
<Lambda> I've been pronouncing Snivy wrong :<
<Mikey> that cilan character needs to quit making those food puns though it was getting on my last damn nerve
<TurniBrony> With a w.
<Lambda> Yeah, he's annoying
<Lambda> I like how they use the in game music
<Mikey> ITZ A RE$IP33 4 FR!3ND$H!P!!!!!!!!!1111!1111!1111!!111
<Ghosties> 4This makes me pine for Escape From New York
<Mikey> I love the snivy episode
<Lambda> it would be so much better if it was Ash Brock and Misty....
<Lambda> yeah me too
<Mikey> ITS HOW I FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE IN HALF AN HOUR /foreveralone
<TurniBrony> Why so?
<Ghosties> 4I dunno really...I think because I wanna see Kurt Russel being the man that would later inspire the creation of Solid Snake
<Nightboomfer> Celestia's crown fits on Spike the Dragon's head
<Nightboomfer> royal coup
<Lambda> Woah
<TurniBrony> Haven't seen it?
<Lambda> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/070/3/5/HATERS_GONNA_HATE_VII_by_iNegacion.jpg
<Mikey> wow
<Ghosties> 4I have actually
<prince-dari> Any pokemon other than the originals with Brock, Misty, and Ash, meh.
<Ghosties> 4And I enjoyed it, even if I did lose track of where the film was going halfway after the movie was over...
<Lambda> none will ever be as good as the originals
<Mikey> at least when brock cooked and made food puns he was wearing a lacey doily apron
<Mikey> which made up for it
<Lambda> XD yeah
<Lambda> My quit message
<Lambda> :P
<Destroyerbaby> Urgh, so tired. I think it's time for me to quit.
<Nightboomfer> goodnight
<TurniBrony> :P
<TurniBrony> Seen the sequal?
<Destroyerbaby> Night everypony
<DJMidli> man it died in here
<Ghosties> 4No, I haven't. I probably should though
<Flashgen> hi people I don't know
<Fooby> Hello there
<DJMidli> hi Flashgen
<DJMidli> you know now us
<Lambda> O.O
<Flashgen> I don't know anyone named "now us" but if you say so
<Lambda> Mikey
<Lambda> check out this shirt
<Lambda> I need it O.O
<Lambda> http://shirtoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/haters-gonna-hate-snivy.jpg
<Nightmare_Moon> And then I exploded with sad http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/169/6/7/artist_training_ground_day_23_by_egophiliac-d3jag0t.jpg
<TurniBrony> You could say it's basicly the same movie. But with alot more action, and one hell ofa ending.
<Mikey> hahha
<Mikey> that's awesome
<Ghosties> 4Does it star Kurt Russell?
<TurniBrony> Ofcourse.
<Flashgen> :(
<Ghosties> 4Then it's worth seeing
<TurniBrony> It is.
<BiiiiigMacintosh> ;_;
<Ghosties> 4I'll admit, I do like some action films
<Ghosties> 4But overall, I just can't get into the ones released today
<[zZz]ekeS> Nightmare_Moon: can you tinyurl the link?
<Nightmare_Moon> You can't just doubleclick it [zZz]ekeS?
<TurniBrony> :P I have no problem with the recent ones.
<Nightboomfer> ;_;
<TurniBrony> Machete from last year might be the best action movie I've ever seen.
<Mongoose> Who would even be mean to derpy?
<DuskBright> I'm beginning to give up on trying
<Nightboomfer> D'awwww
<[zZz]ekeS> Nightmare_Moon: my phone's ssh client's url scanner doesnt like linebreaks :s
<Ghosties> 4Machete, I know what you're talking about
<DuskBright> dangus internet
<Ghosties> 4Had that guy...
<Nightboomfer> Silver spoon, diamond tiara, gilda, trixie
<Nightmare_Moon> Ah, phone, ew. hold on
<Nightboomfer> snips, snails
<Mongoose> True
<Ghosties> 4I can't remember his name :(
<Fluttershy_RP> Thunderstorms?
<Lambda> thank you deviantArt for ruining my childhood
<DuskBright> Machete wasn't bad... I didn't care for bits of it... but it was generally good
<Fluttershy_RP> On MY dad's fathers day?
<Mikey> ?
<Lambda> http://www.deviantart.com/#/d32fam3
<Mongoose> still, derpy is so damn loveable.
<DuskBright> quentin tarantino (no idea how to spell his name lol)
<Fluttershy_RP> :[
<ZiggyStardust> http://goo.gl/9aLoc
<Mikey> ew
<Mikey> manboob
<Mikey> ;C
<Lambda> XD yeah
<Fluttershy_RP> You Pegasus ponies better STOP this storm right now, you should be ashamed!
<Nightmare_Moon> http://tinyurl.com/3npnmux here you go
<TurniBrony> Didn't have Tarantino. Tho he may have had a hand with producing or something. I dunno.
<Mongoose> 3
<[zZz]ekeS> :s
<Ghosties> 4Speaking of Tarantino, I did wanna see Inglorious Bastards
<SirSprinkles> 6AMAZING MOVIE
<Lambda> :D
<Lambda> the yay song came on my iTunes
<DuskBright> SOOO GOOD
<Lambda> for the record
<DJMidli> actually we need some fathers day images ponified.
<Fluttershy_RP> Everyone, Mongoose shot me yesterday
<Fluttershy_RP> I barely made it.
<TurniBrony> I'll take your word for it.
<Lambda> this song sounds epicly amazing in sorround sound
<Mongoose> She broke my heart
*Fluttershy_RP tears up
<Lambda> *surround
<[zZz]ekeS> (on a side note I really should add that autotinyurl script, but I'm not sure I want every link that pops up in irc sent off)
<Ghosties> 4Why hello Sprinkles :3
<Lambda> ...or however you spell that
<Ghosties> 4Lurking in the chat, are we?
<prince-dari> You got it right the second time.
<Ghosties> 4And I guess you never saw it, Turni?
<Lambda> okay
<TurniBrony> Nope.
<Fooby> Tiny URL makes it impossible for me to see what site I'm going to :c
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<Fooby> I like knowing beforehand if I'm clicking on a link to an image, a youtube video, a fic, etc. before I click it.
<TurniBrony> Some just slip by. :P
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<Fluttershy_RP> I made a dragon cry.
<prince-dari> Anyone have a favourite film?
<Ghosties> 4So what are you hear for this night, Turni? There's no stream, just here to chat?
<Ghosties> 4*here
<Fluttershy_RP> Deal with it.
<Ghosties> 4Jacob's Ladder
<Ghosties> 4My most favorite film of all time
<TurniBrony> The Machinist or The Shining.
<Nightmare_Moon> I should be in bed by now, It's morning somewhere in the. And I have a cosmos to thank tomorrow.
<TurniBrony> Also. Yes, just seeing if there was someone here.
<prince-dari> Hmm, I don't have a favourite, I've seen too many to really decide, and there's not one that I say I really enjoy watching so much more than any other.
<Shaico> where's the fun in that Fooby
<Ghosties> 4The Shining, I can't take the movie seriously when Nicholson continuously makes hilarious faces throughout the film XD
<TurniBrony> Well I could. :P
<Ghosties> 4Give it time, dari, you'll find a movie that'll probably blow your socks off
<SweetieBelle> xm28e4
<TurniBrony> Probably the only horror movie that has ever given me the chills.
<prince-dari> Hmm, I don't really see that happening, I don't have a favourite of anything really.
<TurniBrony> And I saw Jacob's Ladder after you guys talked it up so much in a thread a while back. :P
<Nightboomfer> who's still up?
<Mongoose> Fluttershy...
<Mongoose> make me a women
<Ghosties> 4What did you think, Turni?
<ST_Falcon> i am
<Nightmare_Moon> So, I'm off to bed now. Good Morning everypony, enjoy your waking hours.
<TurniBrony> Predicted the twist off-hand. :P
<ST_Falcon> Night, moon.
<Ghosties> 4Twist aside, what did you think
<Nightboomfer> Man, I am up late if Nightmare Moon goes to bed before I do
<TurniBrony> Eh... Dissapointing. Besides the solid opening.
<Nightmare_Sleeping> the sun is currently rising somewhere over the middle of the atlantic.
<ST_Falcon> You are still not as terrifying as the combination of Ribbons Almasy and Grace O'Conner.
<TurniBrony> Which had a great atmosphere. And I thought the rest would be like that.
<ST_Falcon> But then, that combination is more terrifying than many things.
<ST_Falcon> such as every single monster on Dr. Who.
<TurniBrony> But it wasn't. :P Then there was this whole "for the critics" religious symblism stuff. :p
<SweetieBelle> Well thats nice, it put my password in chat instead of the window... Well, wont be using that one again. BTW, it is already changed
<Ghosties> 4Well, yeah, the movie is based heavily on religion and symbolism
<Ghosties> 4What did you think of the "scary, creepy" stuff? Or how about the hospital scene?
<Fooby> I don't think anyone here would plan on breakinginto your account anyway :s
<TurniBrony> The hospital scene was pretty good. But the rest wasn't exactly scary or creepy.
<TurniBrony> Someone said it inspired Silent Hill. So I also went into thinking there would be a lot of "otherworldiness" and stuff like that.
<SweetieBelle> I agree, but.. best be sure :P
<Fooby> I don't blam eya'
<Fooby> blame*
<Nightboomfer> sho'nuff
<SweetieBelle> I had to re-register with a different, dedicated addy anyways :) (made it for the blog/login for the site)
<Ghosties> 4Nah, though that scene and the special effects of the creatures and atmosphere, as well as cinematography, did have a tremendous affect on Silent Hill as a series
<TurniBrony> And that silly fasthead stuff. :P
<Ghosties> 4If you want "otherworldiness," go watch the actual Silent Hill film
<Fluttershy_RP> Oh
<SweetieBelle> This is the best fandom I have ever seen, I am proud to be part of it
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, the whirring head effect was really prominent in the Silent Hill series.
<SirSprinkles> 6The Silent Hill movie was really good. IMO
<Ghosties> 4You can just get out Sprinkles >:I
<Nightboomfer> I love you too
<TurniBrony> I shall stick with The Machinist. ;P
<SirSprinkles> 6Never seen it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, MAKE ME GHOSTIES
<Ghosties> 4Neither have I, actually
<Ghosties> 4You think I'm gonna kick you, don'tcha?
<TurniBrony> I suppose it is kind of like Jacob's Ladder in some ways.
<SirSprinkles> 6I think you CAN'T
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm ADMIN currently, remember?
<Ghosties> 4I BET THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO
<prince-dari> Lol, you can't kick him.
<prince-dari> He's an admin.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(eXAKR02)03WB* - <eXAKR> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon-Punching bendy buses!
<Ghosties> 4...Oh yeah!?
<SweetieBelle> ^_^
<prince-dari> Oh.
<TurniBrony> Just make out allready. ;P
<Nightboomfer> This really is an awesome/weird fandom.
<prince-dari> Didn't even see Sprinkles had posted.
<prince-dari> XD
<Ghosties> 4You know, a few people the other night did say Sprinkles and I had a RD/AJ relationship thing
<Mongoose> yes it is
<SirSprinkles> 6...did I miss this?
<SirSprinkles> 6What?
<Ghosties> 4You were there, Sprinks -_-
<SirSprinkles> 6I was not paying attention then. XD
<Ghosties> 4-______________________-
<SirSprinkles> 6O-o
<SweetieBelle> As a woman, to me, there is nothing manlier for a man to be himself, even if he loves MLP, and express himself in that.
<SirSprinkles> 6I blame insomnia/hunger
<TurniBrony> I wouldn't be surprised if you guys were married.
<Mongoose> open the door
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<TurniBrony> For 25 years.
<Mongoose> get on the floor
<Isukra> 12eXAKR~~
<Ghosties> 4We're not, he lives all the way up in PA while I live in NC
<Ali1017> T.T <---Manly tears
<prince-dari> Lies.
<SirSprinkles> 6Silver lives in PA.
<prince-dari> They live together.
<SirSprinkles> 6And Hipster is in OH IIRC...
<Ghosties> 4Hipster is in Ohio, Silver and Sprinkles are in PA (albeit opposite sides of the state) and I live in NC
<Ghosties> 4North Carolina
<SirSprinkles> 6Where's DCD and Peanut?
<SirSprinkles> 6...and Bristle?
<Ghosties> 4DCD is in Paname?
<Ghosties> 4*Panama
<Ghosties> 4I know he's not in America
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/0b1AI.jpg
<Nightboomfer> The show itself has helped me evaluate my own friendships. And I try to be as joyful as possible... and I'm really starting to take this whole Love and Tolerate the shit out of you thing seriously
<Ghosties> 4I dunno where Peanut and Bristle
<Ghosties> 4is
<SweetieBelle> I would only be worried if I found an inflatable pony in the shed with a wedding band on its hoof :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, it's Panama
<Ghosties> 4Speaking of which, did Bristle even make it to the streams this weekend?
<Nightboomfer> what if it was Fluttershy?
<SweetieBelle> Then I would steal her for myself!
<SweetieBelle> ;)
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't believe so.
<TurniBrony> He's not as dedicated as I am.
<TurniBrony> :P
*SweetieBelle has to duck to the supermarket, back soon
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, dedicated that you were on our most wanted list for about two weeks
<TurniBrony> ;D
<TurniBrony> But you see I'm really not a bad man.
<Nightboomfer> Am I the Highlander?
<TurniBrony> I have the best of intentions.
<TurniBrony> Besides. I'm probably off that list by now. :P
<Ghosties> 4Yes, well, at least now we finally found a system that works
<prince-dari> I think if you're off the list, there isn't a list any more. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6No, there's one pony I've been watching.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, there's not exactly a "people us mods are finding annoyances with" list anymore
<SirSprinkles> 6Won't say who.
<Ghosties> 4It was all pretty much Turni : /
<Ghosties> 4Why Sprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6Because I don't want word spreading.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll tell you later, maybe.
<TurniBrony> Someone had to champion some sort of "oposition" ;P
<Ghosties> 4Dude, you know you're not supposed to keep secrets from other mods : /
<SirSprinkles> 6Then mod chat.
<Ghosties> Alright
<Ghosties> So what's the deal
<SirSprinkles> It really should be obvious that I'm watching this guy who's been nickchanging constantly.
<Fooby> I wish XChat supported ctrl-tab
<SirSprinkles> He's a bit of a troll.
<Ghosties> Sprinkleburg?
<SirSprinkles> Normal nick he goes by is MFW
<SirSprinkles> Yeah, he used that.
<Ghosties> I thought it was him
<SirSprinkles> He also used Brony_Hipster
<Ghosties> It looked like he was annoying you earlier today
<SirSprinkles> And one other nick.
<Ghosties> Besides the constant nick changing, what's the big deal?
<Ghosties> It's not like he's insulting anyone or trying to cause mischief
<SirSprinkles> He trolls a bit with each nick before changing.
<Ghosties> Can you give me an example how?
<SirSprinkles> It's little things that slowly add up, mostly.
<prince-dari> He also used BroDashRain
<prince-dari> As a nick.
<prince-dari> When we had a user called RainBroDash.
<SirSprinkles> But he uses the nickchanging as a way to make it seem like it's not the same person for those who aren't paying attention.
<Ghosties> So he keeps trying to divert attention away from him
<SirSprinkles> Like I said, I just have my eye on him for the moment.
<prince-dari> I remember a couple weeks ago we had a spambot called "Derpy" in the chat. >___>
<SirSprinkles> But yeah.
<TurniBrony> And I never really had a problem with the mods. Just the lack of creativity some of the bronies had with their choices. :P
<SirSprinkles> I remember that aswell.
<prince-dari> Why someone would drop a spambot in our chat I have no idea. :
<Ghosties> 4Well, Turni, you know that taste is purely subjective
<TurniBrony> Sure, sure.
<Ghosties> I dunno. If the guy continues to make a ruckus, then kick him. If he continues to cause mischief then ban him
<Ghosties> 4Dude, Turni
<SirSprinkles> That was the idea.
<Ghosties> 4Come on
<TurniBrony> But I wanted to see something I hadn't seen before. :P
<SirSprinkles> I think I actually warned him earlier...
<Ghosties> 4Not the mods' fault
<Ghosties> Did he keep up?
<TurniBrony> Like I said. I never ever once blamed the mods.
<prince-dari> I don't know why most mods seem to make a big deal out of kicking people.
<Nightboomfer> goodnight
<Nightboomfer> er, morning
<prince-dari> I don't see why you shouldn't get a kick automatically for talking too much.
<Shaico> just watched the NPR radio
<SirSprinkles> I warned him right before he left for the night.
<Ghosties> 4You mentioned something about "bribing the mods." Don't think that didn't go unnoticed
<Mongoose> How was it?
<prince-dari> That's the way IRC is mostly, and you can just rejoin straight away.
<Fooby> Watching radio
<Shaico> It wasn't as bad as I thought
<Nightboomfer> I used to love NPR
<prince-dari> It's not as though it's a BIG thing.
<Ghosties> 4You sounded awfully trollish a few times
<Nightboomfer> it seems kind of like a cheap shot
<TurniBrony> That was a joke, lighten up.
<Mongoose> I did not watch it.
<Mongoose> what did they say?
<Fooby> NPR just wants to fit iiin
<SirSprinkles> I'm hesitant because we get some ponies that don't know how IRC works and don't know how to rejoin.
<Shaico> except the part where they assumed that every brony is over 20 and unemployed
<Shaico> and yes, i obviously meant heard it.
<prince-dari> They can always refresh the page.
<Ghosties> That's true, IRC isn't exactly the most well known chat system
<Ghosties> 4You pissed Hipster off pretty badly
<SirSprinkles> 6Myself as well.
*^Fluttershy is drunk
<Fooby> Fluttershy D:
<SirSprinkles> 6It was, whether being a joke or not, a question of our integrity.
<prince-dari> Besides, you could add into the rules how to rejoin channels after a kick, so then if they don't know, it's their own faults. (:
<TurniBrony> It was not.
<SirSprinkles> True.
<Mongoose> I never thought that Fluttershy would drink.
<Ghosties> 4We do try to maintain an attitude of professionalism and Hipster and maybe Sprinkles saw it as an attack
<Shaico> she has before
<Shaico> in that one fic
<Fooby> daterape
<Ascendant> ohai
<Shaico> yep
<prince-dari> I'm a fan of not treating stuff on the internet as SRS BIZNIZ.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> eyo :3
<prince-dari> So I didn't really care.
<FlutterAwesome> perhaps that's why she's turned to animals instead?
<Ghosties> Yeah, we could tell them how to rejoin
<lightumbreon|mibbit> now getting tosti's
<Shaico> mfw there are two fluttershys here
<Shaico> :o
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<Mongoose> ....
<Mongoose> One broke my heart.
<Ghosties> 4And that dari is why you're the chatroom :P
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i like Grandma's Tosti's
<FlutterAwesome> meh just came in
<prince-dari> You could even add it into the kick message I suppose.
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Cqis> *Pokes Aristeo*
<Shaico> wtf why is the face cross eyes
<Aristeo> :o
<Shaico> eyed*
<Shaico> :o
<TurniBrony> And why would I question your integrity when I don't really know you guys. Especially not then.
<^Fluttershy> No... no... I just came back from one of Pinkie's parties.
<Mongoose> I am daed
<Cqis> ahh you are still awake
<Ghosties> We should probably at least tell people about it by visiting the rules. Then again, we do that every BMN
<Mongoose> I am dated
<^Fluttershy> ...Pinkie tried a 21 and older type party.
<Shaico> R.I.P Mongoose.
<Mongoose> I am dot
<TurniBrony> Face it, you took it all alittle too seriously.
<Mongoose> I am dedddd
<Shaico> I am God.
<FlutterAwesome> I see...
<Mongoose> deadddaded
<Ghosties> 4It just seemed really distasteful to those guys
<Mongoose> doddead
<Mongoose> didid
<Shaico> duuuuuude
<Shaico> uhhahahah
<Mongoose> I am dud
<Mongoose> edud
<Shaico> im dude

<Mongoose> I am board
<Mongoose> I am a Board
<Mongoose> I eat bored
<Shaico> i like skateboaaaard
<FlutterAwesome> i am broad
<Mongoose> brode
<Ghosties> 4The only real problem that was bugging me is that it made you seem like you were constantly complaining about what people picked, and that's not fair.
<Mongoose> rabk
<Shaico> i am blood
<Shaico> i drink blood
<Mongoose> I am share magic
<FlutterAwesome> i sniff blood?
<Shaico> I am Twilight Princess
<Ali1017> what is this place, filled with so much spammmm
<Mongoose> I am ali
<Shaico> What is this, that stands before me?
<Mongoose> ail ms
<Mongoose> broadali
<TurniBrony> Well. Eventually I got some stuff that I hadn't seen that I wanted to see. :P
<Balloons> ...?
<Shaico> Ohhhh NOoooooOooO!
<Shaico> dunnn
<Shaico> Duuuuuuuu
<Shaico> Bummmmmmmm
<Chromadancer> *tabs in* So what's going on in---omfg the spam
<^Fluttershy> That's kinda annoying.
<^Fluttershy> <_>
<Shaico> < o >
<FlutterAwesome> don't look at the Flutters
<FlutterAwesome> wadn't me
<Ghosties> 4And that's why I'm glad everybody is finally, for the most part, on the same page
<Shaico> ¬¬
<Mongoose> don't lock mod
<prince-dari> Anyone sending as many messages as is required for a kick anyway is pretty hard.
<Mongoose> mode
<prince-dari> Other than due to lag (which very rarely happens).
<Shaico> ∆
<Mongoose> angletri
<Ghosties> I don't know what you mean
<Mongoose> magnlethetri
<TurniBrony> Still. You guys and B movies. ;P
<Shaico> ∆
<Shaico> ∆   ∆
<TurniBrony> Well. Picked a winner this time, atleast there's that.
<prince-dari> Personally I'm fine with any criticism you have, as long as you don't repeat it too much.
<TurniBrony> Saw a clip of it. :x
<Shaico> ∆
<Shaico> ∆ ∆
<Shaico> srry just triforcing here
<Ghosties> 4A winner?
<Mongoose> macktheblacktackshatfacktherackfracktnorkcackcrack
<TurniBrony> The pig movie.
<Ghosties> 4Are you seriously calling Spider's Web a winner?
<Balloons> Sigh* just how bored are you guys?.
<Ghosties> 4*scratches head*
<Ghosties> 4*shrugs*
<Mongoose> Insanly
<Shaico> I dunno
<TurniBrony> I can't argue it's status this time. :P
<Shaico> that's how bored i am
<FlutterAwesome> It's pretty empty
<Shaico> This chat always seems to have lots of people
<Shaico> but no one talking
<Shaico> ever since the new chat
<Fooby> New chat?
<Ghosties> 4You can think Tacowiz for that one. I was there for the selection thread for the first BMN and Tacowiz was dying for it to be chosen
<Shaico> i mean, the new transition
<Shaico> idk how to describe it
<Fooby> Ohh.
<Fooby> The swap to IRC
<Shaico> Yeah
<Mongoose> yeah
<Shaico> wonder what's going on
<FlutterAwesome> people are sleeping?
<Shaico> before there were like 20 people in a channel, but each one was talking
<TurniBrony> It's really short though.
<Unidentified35434> Oh, wait.
<Unidentified35434> I get it.
<Shaico> 58 people here, and only 6 talking
<TurniBrony> 50 minutes or so.
<FlutterAwesome> hmm
<Ghosties> 4Have you seen it already? Oh, a clip
<Unidentified35434> The server's not identifying me properly. I better check my server info on my client.
<TurniBrony> And saw the running time. :P
<^Fluttershy> I'm talking
<RainbowSmash> mm... nah
<^Fluttershy> Hello Dash.
*Shaico declares the new topic shall be "Discuss Fluttershy's perfect match."
<TurniBrony> You could really play a extra pony ep in the end.
<^Fluttershy> I think my perfect match is a tree.
<^Fluttershy> I want to be a tree.
<Shaico> lolwtf
<FlutterAwesome> A tree is fun.
<Shaico> i mean pony
<Mongoose> Tree is wood
<Shaico> What did the tree say to the bartender?
<^Fluttershy> A tree is just as beautiful a forest creature as the little bunnies running around <3
<Shaico> I wood like a beer please.
*BlankFlankBrony wanders back in
<^Fluttershy> Oh, all the little forest creatures.
<Shaico> Wasup BFB
<FlutterAwesome> Don't forget the little creatures indeed
<Ghosties> 4We'll figure out what to do later in the week. If anything, I'm actually happy it's so short. I'm usually exhausted by the time the BMN is over and if we can shorten the actual event then I'm all for it
<BlankFlankBrony> Not much... just doing some end-of-day stuff before calling it a night.
<B-Man> Wait.
<B-Man> Why the hell is the server telling me...
<B-Man> Hm...
<prince-dari> Lol fail.
<FlutterAwesome> o.o?
<Ghosties> 4Wut?
<Shaico> well if going in a dead chatroom is in your list of end-of-day stuff, go ahead and check it off the list.
<Ghosties> 4WELL I GUESS TURNIBRONY DECIDED TO LEAVE
<Shaico> We are deader than a cadaver.
<Ghosties> 4The jerk >:I
<^Fluttershy> I-I'm dead?
<B-Man> I swear, I'm gonna get this fixed so I can auto identify.
<FlutterAwesome> more dead my good friend
<B-Man> :/
<prince-dari> Think he crashed maybe.
<B-Man> ...
<prince-dari> From the quit message.
<Ghosties> 4Eh, oh well
<B-Man> There's no reason that password should be incorrect.
<Ghosties> 4You saw how he left?
<prince-dari> [09:08] * TurniBrony (mibbit@36cd2766.246a3fd8.dhcp.bluecom.no) Quit (Read error: Operation timed out)
<Ghosties> 4Huh, neat
<B-Man> Okay.
<B-Man> There we go.
<Mongoose> Mongoose always dresses in style.
<B-Man> Apparently I have to tell Konversation I'm using nickserv as the service to identify...
<B-Man> Cool.
<prince-dari> I have a voice.
<prince-dari> You guys don't. :P
<prince-dari> :P
<eXAKR> lol I just watched the MLP:FiM episode Pinkie Keen
<Ghosties> SirSprinkles, he's back
<MFW> aww
<eXAKR> Twilight Rapidash
<prince-dari> You want a voice?
<Ghosties> 4I can speak just fine dari
<eXAKR> and Princess Celestia dropping out of nowhere from the sky
<eXAKR> oO;
<^Fluttershy> RarityxApplejack/Rainbow DashxPinkie Pie/Twilight Sparkle x Trollestia/Me x Spike.
<Ghosties> Sprinks, main room
<eXAKR> How?
<^Fluttershy> Is that acceptable?
<prince-dari> I doubt he'll say much, not many people left. :P
<B-Man> Hm...
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Ghosties> Good point
<prince-dari> Twilight Sparkle is evolving!
<B-Man> Okay, so that didn't work as I thought.
<B-Man> Just had to test real quick.
<B-Man> And now I'm in for a while.
<FlutterAwesome> for some reason
<^Fluttershy> I'll ask again
<eXAKR> The last bit where Spike was about to send the letter to Princess Celestia via magic
<^Fluttershy> RarityxApplejack/Rainbow DashxPinkie Pie/Twilight Sparkle x Trollestia/Me x Spike.
<Mongoose> y6es
<FlutterAwesome> I see RarityxRD working
<^Fluttershy> IS IT ACCEPTABLE?
<eXAKR> When she just drops from the sky. takes it, then flies off
<eXAKR> oO
<FlutterAwesome> I dunno why though
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ohai !eXAKR
*eXAKR now belongs to lightumbreon|mibbit for 20 minutes
<prince-dari> Hey mib_5rubc6.
<B-Man> I've got auto identity going, and that's all that matters.
<Hektor_breaker_of_ponies> Oh that reminds me I have a friend and she is always complaining about there never being any RarityxRD fanfiction.
*lightumbreon|mibbit feeds his eXAKR Tosti's
<B-Man> I like Poseidon Project and The Sun Is Tired right now.
<B-Man> Can't wait for more.
<B-Man> Well, can...
<B-Man> Y'know, figure of speech.
<eXAKR> oo
<FlutterAwesome> I really wanna start a fanfic
<FlutterAwesome> but I just can't seem to find the inspiration for one
<Malt> Kinda the same for me.
<prince-dari> Fairly Odd Parents?
<lightumbreon|mibbit> eh?
<lightumbreon|mibbit> the reference or what?
<prince-dari> Welp, just the three of us.
<Fooby> OH
<Fooby> Oh oh oh I can help
<prince-dari> Actually no, I was just saying it for no reason.
<Fooby> >Rewatch old episodes
<Fooby> >notice animation error or odd background detail
<Fooby> >make a conspriacy out of it
<Ghosties> 4Just like old times
<Fooby> >instant fanfic.
<Fooby> BAM
<prince-dari> Regular users are asleep POST WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT!
<FlutterAwesome> lol
<Ascendant> lol fairly odd parents
<prince-dari> Rainbows! :D
<Fooby> Hang on.
<Fooby> Let me grab a screenshot,
<Fooby> 'cause this is is how a friend and I are going to co-author an AWESOME fic
<prince-dari> It's a trap!
<prince-dari> Oh whoops.
<prince-dari> I always forget to turn these things off.
<Ghosties> 4True
<lightumbreon|mibbit> hehehe
<Ghosties> 4I post in reds
<eXAKR> Suddenly.
<eXAKR> Princess Celestia
<eXAKR> Also
<eXAKR> Congratulations! Your TWILIGHT SPARKLE evolved into RAPIDASH!
<lightumbreon|mibbit> my butt hurts from these stupid chairs at my Granma's PC X.x
<Ghosties> 4Oh, now you're just showing off
<prince-dari> :P
<lightumbreon|mibbit> and take note, HP Keyboards suck, badly
<eXAKR> Change them
<eXAKR> Use a Logitech
<eXAKR> Or an IBM Model M
<Fooby> Do you remember this scene from A Bird In The Hoof?
<Fooby> http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q120/leaf_on_wind/whatarethosedoingthere.png
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i use a ZBoard, a gaming model, the best out there
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<FlutterAwesome> yeah I remember that
<prince-dari> I tried a random kick.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> but my grandma is stubborn and gets these crappy ones :/
<prince-dari> I'm the only person I can kick.
<SweetieBelle> FiM = Avatar perfection with more <3 ^_^
<prince-dari> Except I've tried it 4 times and it's only tried to kick you Ghosties. O_o
<Fooby> Why does Fluttershy have the Gala dresses D:?
<prince-dari> Oh, I can't even kick myself.
<SweetieBelle> I think it suits her
<prince-dari> Random kick, but it 12 tries for it to try and kick me with only 3 of us on here.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Ghosties> 4Dari, I would kick you but you're the hobo of our chatroom that we feel sorry for. That, and you ARE the chatroom, I can't kick you!
<^Fluttershy> Eek!
<FlutterAwesome> hmm...
<prince-dari> Take a note.
<prince-dari> XD MFW
<SweetieBelle> Hehe, timing
<TurniBrony> I am terminated?
<prince-dari> You left ages ago.
<Hektor_breaker_of_ponies> why wouldn't she?
<FlutterAwesome> An idea is forming...
<lightumbreon|mibbit> XD MFW?
<Hektor_breaker_of_ponies> Doesn't Rarity show up in her GGG dress at the tea party?
<FlutterAwesome> but I don't think I can make a story with it
<Ghosties> 4And Turni returns
<TurniBrony> I never left
<Shaico> it doesn't show rarity's dress i think
<TurniBrony> THEN WHO WAS FONE?!
<prince-dari> [09:08] * TurniBrony (mibbit@36cd2766.246a3fd8.dhcp.bluecom.no) Quit (Read error: Operation timed out)
<prince-dari> It was only 17 minutes ago, apparently I'm just going crazy.
<Shaico> i think Fluttershy has them for safe keeping o3o
<Fooby> You're doing it wrong.
<prince-dari> My Face When
<TurniBrony> Guess it kicked me out for inactivity or something.
<Fooby> I started that -- rationalizing.
<Fooby> If you want a fic idea,
<Fooby> MAKE A CONSPIRACY OUT OF IT
<Fooby> And so I did.
<TurniBrony> idk
<Fooby> FLUTTERSHY THE MASTER THIEF
<SweetieBelle> I want to write a Battlestar Galactica/MLP crossover.. RainbowDash would be a perfect Starbuck
<lightumbreon|mibbit> right.....
<Fooby> Also you can't take it 'cause it's mine :c
<prince-dari> Your connection just lagged too much so the server kicked you I suppose.
<eXAKR> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/108/766/MLP_Books_4.jpg?1301091345
<^Fluttershy> Yeah...
<FlutterAwesome> Well I can do something about Fluttershy's hidden past.
<^Fluttershy> I have her dresses.
<TurniBrony> I guess.
<prince-dari> Though normally when that happens you'll get "Ping timeout 120 seconds".
<^Fluttershy> She keeps bothering with me.
<^Fluttershy> W-what hidden past?!
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i have a book here
*^Fluttershy looks around suspiciously
<lightumbreon|mibbit> it's awesome, no, epic
<Shaico> The best fic is a good fic.
<Shaico> True stroy
<FlutterAwesome> Don't worry, I have no idea as of now.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> it was expensice, aroun 67 Euro's
<Fooby> You'll think of something.
<prince-dari> Why so much?
<TurniBrony> Maybe it was custom styled to fit my personal needs.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> History, Legacy & Legend, Duke Nukem Forever, Art From The Vaults
<SweetieBelle> I strongly recommend this to all writers.. http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter.html
<lightumbreon|mibbit> because the special edition was expensive
*lightumbreon|mibbit runs
<Fooby> What does it do? .-.
<TurniBrony> So.
<prince-dari> I dunno, maybe they changed the default timeout message for this network, though I've never seen any other networks which give message other than that for a ping timeout.
<FlutterAwesome> Apparently
<SweetieBelle> Its a novel writing program, basically, information storage.. best to have a look, its the best I have seen.
<FlutterAwesome> you can make chapters with it
<SweetieBelle> Storyboard, character bios... the lot
<SweetieBelle> and yes
<eXAKR> DNF
<eXAKR> Duke Nukem Forever
<SweetieBelle> Then I convert to ebook formats (epub usually) using Calibre 2
<lightumbreon|mibbit> yes
<eXAKR> The game that took 14 years to develop
<lightumbreon|mibbit> great game, ot the best, but still epic
<SweetieBelle> I take fics from here on my ebook reader :)
<lightumbreon|mibbit> yes, it came out not too long ago
<lightumbreon|mibbit> already beated it :P
<FlutterAwesome> I prefer to write things as I feel it
<FlutterAwesome> then break it up and edit it
<prince-dari> I heard a lot of people were disappointed with it.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> those don't know what a real game is
<lightumbreon|mibbit> those where alot of CoD fanatics
<SweetieBelle> Its good for that
<lightumbreon|mibbit> only because Gearbox helpt Develop DNF
<SweetieBelle> I ended up swapping chapters and things with stories I have written
<prince-dari> Sweeping generalisation FTW.
<eXAKR> They were like
<lightumbreon|mibbit> Gearbox also made Modern Warfare 2
<eXAKR> Duke, I am disappoint
<SweetieBelle> Scenes, you can check who is in what chapter and things.
<SweetieBelle> 1.9 meg
<lightumbreon|mibbit> the game was epic
<lightumbreon|mibbit> not the best game, but worthy of a place in history
<TurniBrony> So. What's up?
<prince-dari> Nothing much for me.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> tommorow is the first day of school for me since i fell sick, i want to know what everyone thinks of DNF
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i want to laugh, i'm gonna quote them too xD
<SweetieBelle> What is yWriter?yWriter is FREE to download and use! No registration, no time limits, no expiry.yWriter is a word processor which breaks your novel into chapters and scenes, helping you keep track of your work while leaving your mind free to create. It will not write your novel for you, suggest plot ideas or perform creative tasks of any kind.
<TurniBrony> And apperantly the rest is doing their best Fluttershy impression.
<Ghosties> 4I'm watching gameplay for Duke Nukem 3D
<SweetieBelle> Sorry if this is classified as spamming, itll be the last msg
<SweetieBelle> Organise your novel using a 'project'.Add chapters to the project.Add scenes, characters, items and locations.Display the word count for every file in the project, along with a total.Saves a log file every day, showing words per file and the total. (Tracks your progress)Saves automatic backups at user-specified intervals.Allows multiple scenes within chaptersViewpoint character, goal, conflict and outcome field
<TurniBrony> >Can't buy Duke Nukem Forever because my stationary is busted. ;_;
<TurniBrony> What a world.
<^Fluttershy> "It will not write your novel for you" I lol'd
<Ghosties> 4I have the demo for DNF, but I never finished it
<SweetieBelle> Hehe
<TurniBrony> Maybe I should try the demo.
<TurniBrony> Cause playing FPSes on a laptop is hella rad.
<Ghosties> 4Haha, I'd only play Doom II :D
<Ghosties> 4My laptop isn't meant for gaming
<FlutterAwesome> Well I do have a pair of unfinished stories somewhere in my notebooks
<TurniBrony> Neither is mine. Don't have a mouse either. :P
<eXAKR> bbl in a bit
<Ghosties> 4I thankfully do have an external mouse so I can play Morrowind on
<lightumbreon|mibbit> k'
<Ghosties> 4There's just no possible way to play a FPS without a mouse, I don't see how it's humanly possible :S
<SweetieBelle> Ditto
<SweetieBelle> One I start writing.. I cant stop
<ST_Falcon> It's starting that's hard.
<FlutterAwesome> That and finding another scene to switch to
<Libri> Oh, cool.
<Libri> Mono.
<FlutterAwesome> you know you have the main idea down
<TurniBrony> It is. But it's so awkward that it pretty much ruins it.
<^Fluttershy> One I start
<^Fluttershy> OoOOooOoOOoh.
<SweetieBelle> Thats why I like ywriter. I keep a bio on all the characters, when I think of a storyline, I browse, extrapolate and see what I can do from there
<Libri> I'll give it a try.
<SweetieBelle> :D Fluttershy at a desk writing, getting excited, so adorrrable!
<FlutterAwesome> ditto
<SweetieBelle> "yay"
<Libri> I'm using a personal wiki to keep track of that shit right now.
<FlutterAwesome> lol
<Libri> But having everything in one place would be cool.
<SweetieBelle> Mmm, thats a good idea
<TurniBrony> I sure did have fun trying to play Fallout New Vegas on the laptop.
<SweetieBelle> I watched Sonic Rainboom last nite, :D Fluttershy cheering, I almost fell off my chair laughing
<SweetieBelle> :o Story idea.
<User_3202> WW
<TurniBrony> Couldn't bother with it. :P Shame, since it's a terrific game.

<applebloom> ANY1 A GIRL HERE?
<SirSprinkles> Yeah, because half ops can't kick half ops
<DJMidli> Im from outside the US
<SweetieBelle> Mm, it did for me.. they might be invisible to the OS

*SweetieBelle raises a hoof again
<sklar> so its 4:50 here how bout you
<prince-dari> But ops can kick ops.
<SirSprinkles> Yep
<TurniBrony> 10:49AM
<prince-dari> Makes no sense.
<sklar> where do you live
<PaintSplash> @DJMidli :Canada...is it cold there, like right now?
<MiddaySparkle> Tch, Canadian riots aren't as good as SAmerican soccer riots.
<PaintSplash> I've been thinking of picking up and moving there...for many reasons....one being I despise summer...
<applebloom> G3 IZ BES.. BAD
<TurniBrony> Norway
*SweetieBelle ish an aussie girl ^^
<applebloom> ALL OF U LOVE G3
<sklar> Ahh the hunt begins:)
<prince-dari> Lawl John Cleese. Classic.
<applebloom> ALL OF U
<TurniBrony> Where it almost seems at times like I'm the only brony. :P
<PaintSplash> Long Island is famous for humid, never ending summers...at least now a days.
<MiddaySparkle> I need a clever name for Pinkie
<DJMidli> PaintSplash most of our cities still have summer. unless you go further up north.
<Flashgen> in what contex?
<Flashgen> context*
<MiddaySparkle> something like my previous names
<prince-dari> You're only an hour ahead of me Turni.
<DJMidli> PaintSplash 85% of us live within 300km of the US border. you have to be one of the 15% that doesn't for lack of summer
<prince-dari> Have you not slept yet?
<SweetieBelle> A pet name, or nickname? Affectionate, general?
<MiddaySparkle> Plentity, MiddaySparkle, RainbowSmash, FlutterAwesome
<DJMidli> now granted our "Summer" is still shorter and not as hot as lets say..neveda
<sklar> yes
<PaintSplash> Well...I was hoping for a cooler summer...
<MiddaySparkle> It's all June Gloom here in LA
<PaintSplash> than where I currently reside...
<Flashgen> uhhhhhhh
<sklar> got up at 11:00 haven't rested once
<applebloom> bye
<TurniBrony> Well. I woke up at 22:00 or something.
<applebloom> cya all
<Ali1017> naptown, nuff said
<MiddaySparkle> gnite/day
<sklar> thats one right
<sklar> no wait
<Libri> Well, yWriter seems like a useful tool... But it's ugly as hell.
<TurniBrony> Ten
<MiddaySparkle> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH IDEA
<sklar> thanks i'm a dumb american her derr
<Ali1017> *plays Rarity's IDEA soundboard*
<TurniBrony> :P
<sklar> so whats it like in norway
<DJMidli> PaintSplash and no right now where i live in ottawa on average gets up to a high of 75-85 and feels like 90-100 with humidity.
<PaintSplash> I guess I sund kinda dim, I certainly didn't mean that Canada doesn't have summers...just shorter or generally cooler ones I assumed...depending on where you were.
<Ali1017> well, was it taken alrady
<DJMidli> the humidity is ottawa specific however as we live in a valley
<TurniBrony> Same as in any other places. Only it's in the future
<sklar> damn mind blown
<DJMidli> PaintSplash not really. we get used to hearing crazy things about americans opinions on our weather.
<SweetieBelle> Its productive though :P
<DJMidli> including I apparently live in an igloo year round :P
<Ghosties> 4Well, I'm going to bed. It's been fun everybody, I'll see you all later
<Quicksilver> cool (pun intended)
<TurniBrony> o/
<prince-dari> Night Ghosties.
<sklar> love you ghostie
<DJMidli> which Id have to move like 700KM further north to do.
<TurniBrony> How do you guys do that?
<Ghosties> 4No homo
<PaintSplash> I guess I live up to being a clueless american then.
<sklar> maybe
<Ghosties> 4No
<prince-dari> Do what?
<TurniBrony> The name thing.
<sklar> okay
<Ghosties> 4<3
<PaintSplash> At least I don't automatically claim Canda as AMerica's hat and the like.
<prince-dari> The...Name thing?
<sklar> what does that mean
<SweetieBelle> Hehe http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic
<TurniBrony> Name shows up in a diffrent colour and links to their posts on the chat.
<sklar> no the cat face thing
<Ghosties> 4Aw, I hope I didn't make sklar feel bad
<prince-dari> I think that only happens on mibbit when you write out the full nick of someone who's in the channel.
<sklar> bawww you hert my feellings shacky
<sklar> i'm shacking right now for some reason
<TurniBrony> Like Ghosties, sklar, prince-dari
<prince-dari> Yeah.

<PaintSplash> erm...morning...i guess
<Ghosties> 4*shakes head* Alright, now bed. Good night everybody
<prince-dari> Cya.
<sklar> wait
<FlutterAwesome> TVT is the evil Wikipedia
<DJMidli> PaintSplash no you didn't your's was an honest mistake. :P
<sklar> since thiers like no one here can i use colors just this once
<FlutterAwesome> Instead of suckering you in with curious information
<prince-dari> I have to turn the script off.
<FlutterAwesome> I'd live somewhere with short days
<FlutterAwesome> but the cold always gets to me
<TurniBrony> How do I shot colours?
<prince-dari> Bitches still can't handle my rainbow text.
<sklar> 3but now skylar has the colors all your base belong to meeeeeeeeeeeee
<PaintSplash> Such a climate doesn't foster larger cities and suburbs to crop up.
<sklar> 3go to colors pick sjhdkjsadhfasdjksdh ohhhohohoho fffffffuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkkkkk
<PaintSplash> I would think
<prince-dari> There's an option underneath the text box in mibbit I think.
<TurniBrony> Black text for the lulz
<FlutterAwesome> hey as long as there's a way to get food easily and there's electricity and the internet
<FlutterAwesome> I'd be alright
<TurniBrony> Or not
<PaintSplash> It just gets hot as all hell here...and everyone loves it....except me.
<sklar> 4it just turns it back to white
<prince-dari> Default background is white.
<prince-dari> So black text = white text on a black background.
<PaintSplash> So I get to listen to everyone love summer..and bitch about our brief winter...
<sklar> 4because white is suporiero

<TurniBrony> 6I don't see a name on this colour?
<FlutterAwesome> once at the Grand Canyon, but it was almost all melted

<SirSprinkles> 6I don't care if they post color when nopony is here, as long as it's not mine.
<PaintSplash> Well, its a beautiful thing if you enjoy it.
<sklar> 6why?
<SirSprinkles> 6Because I had to EARN this purple.
<sklar> 3oh counter doge to green bitch
<PaintSplash> We are lucky if we get 2 or three big storms a year...
<PaintSplash> but at least it sticks arounf
<TurniBrony> 4What? Did you have to kill a lion with your bare hands? :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I became a mod in the timespan of a week.
<sklar> 10and i earned isanity bitch
<BlankFlankBrony> Snow: lovely to look at, annoying to walk through, hate shoveling it.
<prince-dari> I just went *ENGAGE LURK MODE*

<FlutterAwesome> When I was at the camp
<FlutterAwesome> we had to walk through the snow to get to the cabin
<PaintSplash> I live in a complex, so aside from my car, the complexe shovels the walk...of course if I lived in a house, I'd get a snow blower.

<sklar> 7then we drink in his honor
<PaintSplash> When I was 4 we had a blizzard, I was dressed up and sent out to play with my brothers, and I literally could only take 2 steps at a time before falling over.
<Fireant> Jesus.
<PaintSplash> My brothers had to keep picking me back up.

<sklar> 7guy
<DJMidli> SweetieBelle Our dog tried treating it as swimming.
<sklar> 7prince-dairy is in another castle fuck you toad
<DJMidli> also I love the snow.
<ST_Falcon> You want snow? Come to Montana in January
<PaintSplash> My dog would continually dive into the snow face first...always had a little snow pile on her snout.
<DJMidli> ST_Falcon or i could be where I am, in canada. which is yaknow further north :P
<sklar> 7nn
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<ST_Falcon> All the fucking snow you could ever want. You'll never want to see snow ever again
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<SweetieBelle> Hehe, my dog kept trying to jump on top of it, leap out, fall back in.. Yet when she is in water, she tries to dig holes in it. Stands there, uses one front paw, pushes water aside, then the other front paw..
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7n
<sklar> 7well that solved nothing
<DJMidli> Im canadian ST_Falcon,
<sklar> 7hmm
<DJMidli> "to much snow" is not a term I can compute
<DJMidli> because theres no such thing :D
<DJMidli> I also lived in the german alps where it would snow 40-60cm a day in some cases.
<ST_Falcon> Well, you have it tempered by the fact that you live in Canada.
<sklar> 7talking to myyself in a sing song voice even as i write this here
<ST_Falcon> Which has things besides methamphetamine and despair.
<sklar> 7why didn't you hear my callllllll
<sklar> 7oh whyyyy yiyiiy
<FlutterAwesome> Despair?
<PaintSplash> @DJMidli I share your opinion.
<DJMidli> we have pot and lack of jobs.
<FlutterAwesome> In Canada?
<sklar> 7I thuoght you hold me dearly
<ST_Falcon> No, MONTANA has despair and meth.
<PaintSplash> @DJMidli and you are now 20% cooler to me.
<ST_Falcon> And drunk driving.
<sklar> 7but in the end i guess you didn't feel that way
<sklar> 7but thats okay
<PaintSplash> and no speed limits?
<DJMidli> I snowboard too which also helps with my love of snow
<DJMidli> PaintSplash why?
<ST_Falcon> Pick two and ha ha YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE
<ST_Falcon> Also I hope you like tornadoes
<sklar> 7because i will rise like a phionex from the ashes
<FlutterAwesome> It's good to be in Cali
<PaintSplash> "to much snow" is a term you can't compute.
<Fireant> Pfff
<Fireant> In mah land we fight polar bears with bare hands and eat raw seal meat to survive.
<ST_Falcon> Basically, don't come here.
<FlutterAwesome> all we got is trampy stars and more illegals at the Home Depot than in the back of the squad cars
<sklar> 7and then i will rise once againnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
<sklar> 7but i won't hold a gruge

<DJMidli> PaintSplash and just generally talked about general things
<Archfiend> !stats
<EpicStatsGuy> Stats updating at http://www.ho-ohrealm.net/chat/chatstats...
<Seedybest> I KNOW I got it from this site, and it's a remix of Giggle at the Ghosties
<Isukra> 12Ascendant is a nerd D:
<Seedybest> Any idea where it came from?
<PaintSplash> I guess that was pretty straight forward huh?
<lightumbreon|mibbit> Isukra:
<NightSeas> 12Good night everyone :3
<DJMidli> how does it sound.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> Ascendant will eat you if you say that too loud
<lightumbreon|mibbit> Gnite GL :3
<DJMidli> basey, technoey, housey?
<prince-dari> BANBANBANBANBABANBAN
<FlutterAwesome> drummy?
<PaintSplash> I'm sort of half asleep, I should have assumed.
<Seedybest> Pretty basey
<Isukra> 12lol
<Iskierka> most people here are going to be nerds, they're spending a significant amount of their time on the internet on a poo
<Iskierka> *pokemon chat
<Isukra> 12what
<prince-dari> On a poo?
<prince-dari> Impressive typo.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ^
<Isukra> 12Iskierka, help me find a name that isn't too much like yours
<Iskierka> enter is too close to backspace
<DJMidli> it keeps the lyrics intact or are they chopped up kinda?
<PaintSplash> Sounds like alot of fun though.
<sklar> 7are you there prince-dari or have you left me all drappy
<DJMidli> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uv6XLHJYL8
<Seedybest> Mostly intact, but it loops parts of it a lot
<prince-dari> I'm here.
<DJMidli> hmm.
<sklar> 7leaving me cold and unhappy
<prince-dari> Also WB Turni.
<Iskierka> why can't you find one yourself? I'm terrible for names
<TurniBrony> My internet herped and derped.
<DJMidli> tbh if you have MU, upload the track, and ill be able to ID it in 10seconds flat.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> we noticed...
<sklar> 7godammit norway guy you have made me cry
<DJMidli> cause I'm CONSTANTLY keeping up to date on the remixes xD
<Seedybest> Maybe it would be easier if I just uploa- Yep.
<DJMidli> (comes with the territory of being a DJ)
<sklar> 7it was simply suppose to the prince and I
<prince-dari> O_o
<Seedybest> How many times have you been asked to drop one of these remixes on an unsuspecting club?
<TurniBronyStolenIdentity> Suddenly.
<TurniBronyStolenIdentity> How do I change my name back?
<DJMidli> None yet. I don't spin at clubs
<DJMidli> I HAVE been asked to spin at a MLP themed rave however.
<Seedybest> Tonnes or loads?
<sklar> 7come on I've said weirder things in this song
<Seedybest> They have MLP themed RAVES?
<DJMidli> a promoter in ottawa is getting one together.
<DJMidli> but no not normally.
<DJMidli> given the sucesss of the fandom she's trying to find a venue etc etc and get something pulled off.
<TurniBrony> Maybe I just got cloned like in the 6th Day.
<sklar> 7for are bronie love is strong
<Seedybest> I'm all the way at the bottom of Australia
<Seedybest> Fewer people = fewer bronies, probably
<Seedybest> Here's the song, by the way

<TurniBrony> The movie of the day was Death Wish 2
<DJMidli> Oh torrents..ohu
<Seedybest> What I'd love is an MLP sew-on patch
<Seedybest> Because brutalising leather is awesome
<TurniBrony> Now that rape scene was awkward I'll tell you

<Isukra> 12no
<Seedybest> Yeah, I've been in there looking for boots
<TurniBrony> Or something.
<Isukra> 12your RP character is really unfair and has no weaknesses, virtually impossible to beat
<prince-dari> Am I the only one who doesn't understand RPing?
<sklar> 7ohhh thats mean but a little funny
<Isukra> 12that is a bad character
<Isukra> 12hi prince :)
<lightumbreon|mibbit> as Temporal, Yes, unbeatable
<Isukra> 12exactly so bad
<DJMidli> yeah i can't believe its sitting at 1.4gb now
<TurniBrony> And no way would I ever watch Death Wish 2 with someone else. :P
<lightumbreon|mibbit> when i'm not....erm, it couldn't be worse then ^^;
<drf|away> 03*WB02(eXAKR02)03WB* - <eXAKR> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon-Punching bendy buses!
<sklar> 7no thats a movie for lonsome time
<TurniBrony> Was awkward enough to watch alone. :<
<Seedybest> SweetieBelle, probably wouldn't be too hard to make one, eh? Just layer up some fabrics, bit of glue and BAM. Done.
<Isukra> 12hi eXAKR
<Espeon> 06lolgodmodding
<prince-dari> Why's it awkward?
<sklar> 7should have been postpone
<SweetieBelle> Or get soft leather, have it embroidered
<sklar> 7and made into a super dome
<Isukra> 12!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Isukra for 8 minutes
<Seedybest> Good point
<Isukra> 12Espeon can godmod me all he wants
<sklar> 7where i could rome
<SweetieBelle> Then you have the freedom to download a graphic to the machine
<Isukra> 12he's worth it :3
<Seedybest> What would you pick for the image, though?
<Jen> Hi, Bronies!
<prince-dari> I tried RPing once, I just felt stupid. O_o
<sklar> 7and make some fome
<Ascendant> <censored>, I <censored> hate friends who think you're nothing but...another person.
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have sworn 1 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
<lightumbreon|mibbit> actually, my RP char has weaknesses, evan as Temporal :3
<prince-dari> Hey Jen.
<sklar> 7but who has the phone
<Seedybest> Something subtle like 20% cooler or just full on Pinkie Pie mid-skip?
<Isukra> 12lightumbreon|mibbit
<TurniBrony> Why is Death Wish 2 awkward?
<sklar> 7and will they pick up
<prince-dari> Nothing but another person?
<Isukra> 12you need more than 1 weakness to make a decent char
<lightumbreon|mibbit> you want to know them?
<prince-dari> You are nothing but another person. O_o
<Isukra> 12unless it's a very obvious and large weakness
<TurniBrony> Sevral minute long rape scene.
<Ascendant> Friends are special people.
<Jen> Ah.
<sklar> 7becuase i'm crying in a cup
<prince-dari> Friends are just people I like who like me.
<prince-dari> They're still just people.
<Guest8042845> Bedroom scences in general are pretty awkward.
<Ascendant> They're not just strangers who are there to be laughed at and killed.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> erm...it includes floof, hugs, tickling, and freinds
<sklar> 7just trying to tell you to shut up
<Ascendant> They're people. But not JUST another person.
<prince-dari> Strangers are still just people. O__o
<lightumbreon|mibbit> most stupid weaknesses ever :/
<sklar> 7and i'll strut up
<sklar> 7gett on in the ruff
<TurniBrony> Bedroom scenes I have no real problem with. :P
<sklar> 7just in you and me in the buff
<Espeon> 06In fact one stereotypical weakness is worse than no weaknesses if you ask me. And Ascendant if you're nothing but another person to them... then they're not really a friend o.o
<Ascendant> Friends aren't just some random person. They're someone you know and that you should be able to trust, not end up in tears over some <censored>.
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have sworn 2 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
<sklar> 7making it tough
<SweetieBelle> :D I saw someone wearing a 20% cooler shirt yesterday too :P
<SweetieBelle> Maybe the MLP FiM logo
<Espeon> 06I would say you're swearing for the sake of it, but I'll just pretend it doesn't happen :P
<sklar> 7but we like it rough
<Ascendant> argh crap, I'm going to get off before I cause any more trouble, sorry
<Isukra> 12lightumbreon|mibbit
<Isukra> 12those aren't really weaknesses at all
<Ascendant> I don't need to cause drama
<Seedybest> Maaaaaybe
*Espeon hugs Ascendant
<Guest8042845> Can I ask an administrator if there is any way I can make an account on the chat?
<Espeon> 06Just take care, alright?
<Isukra> 12take care Ascendant
<prince-dari> You can register a nickname.
<Isukra> 12hope you feel better :/
<prince-dari> That way no one else can steal it.
<sklar> 7and it'll make you tough
<lightumbreon|mibbit> bye Ascendant >:
<Guest8042845> And how may I do that? (Thanks for your help!)
<prince-dari> First type /nick the_you_want_here
<Seedybest> Oh cool!
<Seedybest> https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEZtWExHMmNNWXBDWTMzR1JUbGxrN1E6MQ
<sklar> 7like i said you and me in the buff
<lightumbreon|mibbit> and Isukra, more weaknesses: Shaving off floof, and i think you remember that one.... D:<
<sklar> 7but now that time is over
<Isukra> 12not really a weakness
<sklar> 7i guess was just a pushover
<Isukra> 12you grew the hair back in like an hour
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ...
<lightumbreon|mibbit> 2 days ;.;
<SweetieBelle> :D
<Isukra> 12and it didn't cause you any real distress
<sklar> 7and like a rover
<Espeon> 06wouldn't you end up rather super-poofy after say, 10 days then? o.O
<prince-dari> I think that nick might already be registered Jen, because it changed your name to Guest8042847 automatically.
<Isukra> 12that harmed your abilities to fight or injure you
<prince-dari> So you need to choose a different one.
<Guest8042847> -le sigh-
<FlutterAwesome> OoOoh pretty...
<Guest8042847> Thanks for your help, though.
<sklar> 7you left me their
<Isukra> 12we are having 2 different definitions of weaknesses going on here XD
<Guest8042847> I know just what I want.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> well, there is one
<sklar> 7with a blank stair
<sklar> 7ohhohoohoho
<sklar> 7whoohooho
<SweetieBelle> Waaant

<prince-dari> Ok.
<sklar> 7just leave me to die
<Isukra> 12my definition of a weakness is something that is really effective against you, giving you a large disadvantage in a fight if such thing is used against you.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> if i remember correctly, Distortion of a time space continium over the Temporal orb at Temporal hill, and using that absorbed power against me, should kill me
<Isukra> 12whats yours? XD
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i just said it
<sklar> 7stabed me in the eye
<lightumbreon|mibbit> DX
<prince-dari> Now type: /msg NickServ REGISTER Passwordhere Emailhere
<sklar> 7but make it'll make you fry in the end
<prince-dari> I think on this network it sends you a confirmation email.
<prince-dari> With a code to complete the registration.
<DJ-Midli> so just read the nightly wrapup
<Isukra> 12you're not a dialga
<DJ-Midli> the story about the guy whos mother threw out his ponies
<Isukra> 12you're an umbreon :P
<DJ-Midli> his rarity* cause "it was garbage" wow.
<DJ-Midli> heartbreaking
<BlankFlankBrony> I jawdropped when I heard about it.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i killed a Dialga
<sklar> 7but still i cry
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i was the last Temporal Descendant in line
<lightumbreon|mibbit> so, :3
<eXAKR> http://applejack.sourceforge.net/ <---
<eXAKR> Applejack
<Espeon> 06I don't really have any established "character" or anything anyway soo :P
<Espeon> 06No
<sklar> 7and i die a little inside
<Espeon> 06It has applejack
<Espeon> 06Just npo
<eXAKR> Helping people solve their Mac problems
<Espeon> 06no
<Isukra> 12lol
<eXAKR> Ohhi
<eXAKR> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to eXAKR for 16 minutes
<eXAKR> !isukra
*Isukra now belongs to eXAKR for 17 minutes
<SweetieBelle> Maybe the mother was jealous of Rarity
<Espeon> 06I should add pony, all the pony names and others to the part of my script that limits what people can make me say
<Espeon> 06because HAH
<sklar> 7as i contemplate sucide
*Espeon flops
<sklar> 7but nooooo!
<sklar> 7 i am strong
<Jenemmy> :DDD
<eXAKR> Espeon
<Iskierka> rp characters don't necessarily need explicit weaknesses. they just need to not be all-powerful and behave realistically
<eXAKR> What are you doing?
<sklar> 7i will rise once again like a phoenix from the ashes
<Espeon> 06Not much at all.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> agreed Iskierka, Lightumbreon isn't the most powerfull oe
<lightumbreon|mibbit> Lightlugia and G-1 are :P
<Espeon> 06And that's true enough Iskierka
<Iskierka> from what I hear you're still pretty bad for being too powerful, but there's always far worse
<Isukra> 12the way i see it
<sklar> 7jenemmy do want to join in my song
<BlankFlankBrony> lol Could be.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> but G-1 is a prick, he's always bragging
<Isukra> 12we all have strengths and weaknesses irl
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ^
<sklar> 7it will make us strong
<Isukra> 12if you make a character with no weaknesses whatsoever
<DJ-Midli> lol
<prince-dari> [11:18] <eXAKR> Helping people solve their Mac problems | LOL it actually is. Why is it named after a pony? O___o
<Isukra> 12you aren't being very realistic
<DJ-Midli> tbh i have a feeling it was more of the sterotyping bs.
<Iskierka> but not necessarily explicit ones
<prince-dari> Weakness: Death
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Pjony> " Quotes like the one at the start of the Wired interview that everyone keeps blasting us with are exactly what they are looking for. " hmmmh?
<Isukra> 12we all have explicit weaknesses as well irl
<DJ-Midli> Mother either thought her son was gay, or into girly things and knee jerk reacted in an attempt to force-mold her son into what she wanted
<Jenemmy> Alrighty, What song ARE you singing?
<Espeon> 06About to say Weakness: Bullets or something like that @dari xD
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i have a weakness irl
<Isukra> 12something we keep to only ourselves because it could cause great harm if that info got into the wrong hands
<Jenemmy> All I have been hearing is pain and gibberish ^^:
<prince-dari> We do
<sklar> 7because i've been making up a song since 5:48 or somethong
<prince-dari> ?
<DJ-Midli> Pjony he's talking about the "Self-medicates by watching ponies"
<FlutterAwesome> Holy crazysicles, Valve has brony employees? I respect them 20% more now.
<Iskierka> almost everyone has a weakness from their past; a realistic character has a decent history, so they'll have some vulnerability in that way
<SweetieBelle> Pretty common sadly, especially in these times and as teens find themselves, become their own person..
<sklar> 7so i got else to put on
<sklar> 7 but i will go on
<lightumbreon|mibbit> agreed
<Jenemmy> Okey Dokey Lokey!
<Iskierka> but that's not something that would be an explicit weakness, in my eyes
<Jenemmy> And when the sun shines
<sklar> 7keep us strong
<BlankFlankBrony> I like the Gorden Freemane avatar.
<prince-dari> I don't have some specific weakness IRL.
<Jenemmy> The light hits my eyes
<lightumbreon|mibbit> most common one around here, I THINK, should be being teased with being so damn awesome, referring to the interests here
<Jenemmy> Painfully.
<sklar> 7and you got sing along to your song
<Jenemmy> But you know this whole thing is wrong.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> *most common interests
<Jenemmy> You and me, and me and you.
<Jenemmy> The whole world needs your additude.
<Espeon> 06But completely randomly but still related
<Isukra> 12if your character is made specifically for battling though
<Espeon> 06the ones that I get annoyed at the most
<Isukra> 12there needs to be some sort of big weakness
<Jenemmy> So stand up and fight, get back your rights.
<Espeon> 06are the ones who for some reason has to try to "win" any roleplay
<Espeon> 06xD
<Iskierka> a character made specifically for battling should be balanced, yes
<Isukra> 12why do you think in pokemon
<sklar> 7take flight
<DJMidli> ditto
<Isukra> 12there isn't a pokemon that has like 500 of each stat
<Isukra> 12and has no weakness
<Jenemmy> Get rid of the cold and heartless nights.
<FlutterAwesome> agreed
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ^
<Isukra> 12because it'd be too powerful and everyone would use it
<Jenemmy> (Wow, never thought I'd get this far)
<Espeon> 06usually there's some glass cannon shenanigans going on if they have high stats for sure
<DJMidli> also Pjony it doesn't help that it states hes unemployed.
<Espeon> 06in attack, at least
<Jenemmy> Woaaaahhh
<Espeon> 06you get what I mean
<Espeon> 06you can't have your cake and eat it too, etc
<Jenemmy> Wooo-ooo-aahh-ohhhh.
<DJMidli> which is where fox decided to stretch the truth like crazy and say we are all seeking welfare because where "addicted to pony"
<lightumbreon|mibbit> my characters bio isn't anything of pokemon at all, it's a giand and brilliant mixture of differrent games, sometimes referring to other games, beings
<sklar> 7whhhhhhhhhhhooooooooooahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Jenemmy> Go with the flow.
<Isukra> 12i know
<Isukra> 12i'm just giving an example
<prince-dari> But the saying always told me you CAN have you cake and eat it? D:
<Jenemmy> Unlock the code.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> and of course, powerfull things, maybe even religions
<Espeon> 06I never understood it anyway
<Espeon> 06I mean if you have a cake
<sklar> 7just enter the mode
<Espeon> 06why not eat it?
<Jenemmy> Think about the world drowning but you're afloat.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ^
<Isukra> 12XD
<SweetieBelle> Small minded people have to apply derogatory stereotypes and insults to make what they dont understand fit into their pathetic little worlds.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> GLaDoS will get pissed .-.
<DJMidli> tbh I'm not worried because so far all of the hate has been from non reliable news sources or ones with absolutely no journalstic integrity.
<Isukra> 12well what if you bought the cake for someone else?
<Espeon> 06well then it's not your cake
<Espeon> 06kinda
<prince-dari> Well lots of saying don't make sense when you take them out of the context of how they were originally formed.
<Isukra> 12for like their birthday party or something
<Isukra> 12well it's your cake until you give it to them
<Espeon> 06Yes
<sklar> 7so go to the goat
<Jenemmy> ...
<prince-dari> In fact most tend not to make sense until you actually look at their origins.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> cake and RP's
<Isukra> 12"Then" it's their cake
<lightumbreon|mibbit> main cassarole of the day
<Jenemmy> Empty the moat?
*BlankFlankBrony nods
<Pjony> riiight, cause being unemployed is compareable across the pond to eating babies
<Jenemmy> Stand around, watch 'em gloat.
<SweetieBelle> Nope, dingoes eat them.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> agreed prince-dari, i worked a very long time to complete the orgin of my character, like 2 á 3 months
<Jenemmy> Get on the boat, and take of to-
<Jenemmy> ANYWHERE
<DJMidli> correct.
<Jenemmy> I SAY ANYWHERE~
<SweetieBelle> I ride around in a kangaroo pouch so the dropbears dont eat me.
<Jenemmy> Mmmmmm
<DJMidli> if you're unemployed in USA your worthless pathetic etc etc etc.
<Jenemmy> Mmmhmmmmmmm~
<lightumbreon|mibbit> how better it is worked on, hom much more fun it is to use the Character
<lightumbreon|mibbit> *how
<prince-dari> I was talking about sayings, but I agree with whatever you're talking about too. XD
<sklar> 7but stop right there
<DJMidli> and god forbid you apply for welfare you scum sucking lazy government abuser.
<SweetieBelle> Living in a trailer park spending every cent you get on drugs and living on food stamps
<DJMidli> yep.
<sklar> 7cause i'm no normal mare
<DJMidli> as the stereotype goes.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i know right xD
<Isukra> 12XD
<Jenemmy> (It's all you, I'm clueless)
<prince-dari> "You can't have your cake and eat it too -- One can't use something up and still have it to enjoy. This proverb was recorded in the book of proverbs by John Heywood in 1546, and is first attested in the United States in the 1742 'Colonial Records of Georgia' in 'Original Papers, 1735-1752.' The adage is found in varying forms: You can't eat your cake and have it too. You can't have everything and eat it too; Eat your cake and have the crumbs in bed with you, etc. ..."
<sklar> 7cuase i've got the stare
*SweetieBelle packs her stuff and moves to Equestria
<sklar> 7that will put you in despair
<prince-dari> Eat your cake and have the crumbs in bed with you?
<prince-dari> Interesting.
<DJMidli> Just come live in canada.
<Seedybest> Take a punt, how many bronies do you think there are in Melbourne?
<SweetieBelle> I know one other.
*lightumbreon|mibbit lost track .-.
<Pjony> Ok I get that kinda about the self-medication thing
<Iskierka> because the crumbs are just as good as the original cake was
<SweetieBelle> But, there has to be more..
<Isukra> 12o-o
<DJMidli> Notice how no canadian news has bashed MLP yet
<DJMidli> SweetieBelle 100-200 at least
<Pjony> but the first quote-quote is imo pretty damn great
<SweetieBelle> I haven't seen any Australian news do that either
<SweetieBelle> And when FiM show here...
<SweetieBelle> I know all op shops have been cleared out of ponies >.<
<sklar> 7if you don't work as a pair
<Espeon> 06Oh
<DJMidli> Austrialia and Canada are practically brother/sister when it comes to how we act.
<Espeon> 06have the cake as in already eat it?
<Espeon> 06well I guess that makes more sense o.O
<Isukra> 12you can have your Espeon
<Isukra> 12and eat it too
<SweetieBelle> So I have heard
<Isukra> 12well
<Isukra> 12maybe just because you have your cake
<Espeon> 06o3o
<sklar> 7(got anything or i'm going to say something stupid)
<Isukra> 12doesn't mean that the right chance hasn't happened yet
<Isukra> 12you can't eat cake and drive a car for example at the sametime
<SweetieBelle> When I was travelling some Canadian tourists said that AU was just like being at home, minus the snow
<Isukra> 12you have to wait to get to the house or where ever you are stopping
<sklar> 7you will never escape this flare
<DJMidli> yep. all my friends who have vacay'd came back saying the same thing.
<Isukra> 12you can't eat your cake in a no eating cake zone
<Isukra> 12however i have never heard of such a zone XD
<sklar> 7and i got no(dammit)
<DJMidli> and we had an aussie who immigrated here, same thing. "its like australia, minus the crazy animals, minus the rugby and minus our good beer"
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i won'tr obey the rules in a no-cake zone
<sklar> 7i got nothin lets start with something new
<Isukra> 12lol
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i'll just eat mine :3
<Sneas> 03777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777
<Isukra> 12then they steal your cake
<lightumbreon|mibbit> the cake is MINE, not theirs, so :3
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i will eat it before it is stolen
<Isukra> 12well they take the cake away from you and make you throw up whatever you ate
<prince-dari> STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!
<prince-dari> Nobody breaks the law on my watch!
<Isukra> 12XD
*lightumbreon|mibbit coughs
<prince-dari> I'm confiscating your stolen goods, now pay the fine, or serve your sentence.
*lightumbreon|mibbit eats his cake in one big bite
<lightumbreon|mibbit> what? i've got nothing
*prince-dari implodes.
<Seedybest> I'd love to see some kind of military-style patch for the show
<sklar> 7well had good run so its over of course until i do it again
<prince-dari> That's funny, because next week we are watching Se7en.
<sklar> 7so what now
<SweetieBelle> I have my own place (Rental market is stupid here atm) am doing classes and stuff.. so cant even go on holidays atm >.<

<Isukra> 12fine
<lightumbreon|mibbit> why did you do that?!
<sklar> 11so its come down to this an Mexican stand-off
<Isukra> 12the saying only makes sense to those who obey the law
<sklar> 11nobody wants to pull the trigger
<prince-dari> Don't be an hero.
<sklar> 11but i've got to
<sklar> 11its been to damn long

<sklar> 11the fight lasted many a hour but hey eventually saw there differences and became good friends except norway guy FUCK HIM
<Plasterduck> What do you mean running out?
<Ascendant> The law is nothing. It's just words to restrict what we do.
<sklar> 11wtf are guys doing
<SweetieBelle> I havent seen them all.
<SweetieBelle> Up to 17
<Archfiend> I feel like I've just broken every bone in my body.
<Plasterduck> Are you taking your time so they last longer?
<SweetieBelle> Yep
<SweetieBelle> Ill probably be through them tomorrow though :-/
<lightumbreon|mibbit> or keeping us from doing stupid things
<Plasterduck> Slow down, otherwise you'll be left with fanfics, pmvs and art to last you until the next season
<SweetieBelle> Ive been reading fics anyway

<Plasterduck> wouldn't that spoil later episodes?
<SweetieBelle> Not offshoots

<Plasterduck> alright
<SweetieBelle> I have a couple of weeks off starting next week
<Espeon> 06Considering how many of us humans think and act, it's pretty much needed :P
<SweetieBelle> I can always watch it all again :)
<Jenemmy> Oh my.
<Jenemmy> I have been on this whole time.
<Jenemmy> Silly me.
<Jenemmy> Leaving random windows open.
<Jenemmy> I also just noticed your name sidebar turns red when you are typing.
<Jenemmy> I was on Equestria Daily P:
<Jenemmy> lolwat
<sklar> 11NORWAY guy is the guy who left
<eXAKR> No law = Somalia
<Jenemmy> Ah.
<sklar> 11he lives in norway so i call him norway guy
<lightumbreon|mibbit> No Law = pretty much the end of social life, and maybe the world
<lightumbreon|mibbit> like, you CAN go around killing people, and get away with it
<lightumbreon|mibbit> doesn't make sense :/
<Ascendant> That's the point.
<Ascendant> Freedom.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> too much freedom can be a problm
<lightumbreon|mibbit> some people will abuse it
<lightumbreon|mibbit> and with no law, say that 75% of the world WILL abuse it
<lightumbreon|mibbit> maybe more :/
<sklar> 11hello
<Ascendant> People will have to learn to be independent and not rely on others.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> and then? what will happe if everyone will go around killing everyone?
<lightumbreon|mibbit> it would be total chaos
<Ascendant> That is the point, lol.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> the law is needed to keep humanity in control, to but it bluntly, that is
<Ascendant> If freedom is outlawed, then only outlaws have freedom.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> that isn't really what everyone wants at the moment
<SweetieBelle> Wish I could sing like SweetieBelle's voice actor
<lightumbreon|mibbit> if that happens, like i said, chaos
<Espeon> 06I get what you mean, but I can't say I agree. In an optimal world laws wouldn't be needed, but this world is quiiiiite far from optimal :P
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ^
<Jenemmy> No offense, but it takes you an awful long time to type, doesn't it?
<sklar> 11yes
<Ascendant> Technically yes, because everyone has different opinions.
<sklar> 11but i can type helluva lot
<lightumbreon|mibbit> everyone his/her opinion
<lightumbreon|mibbit> that makes us human
<lightumbreon|mibbit> or something :/
<Espeon> 06Humans are super-protective about their opinions, add violent behavior and a lack of laws and there might be freedom - but I wouldn't say it's a good kind of freedom.
<sklar> 11i mean I've done what usually takes at least takes like a hundred people
<lightumbreon|mibbit> that is the whole point
<lightumbreon|mibbit> wheps
<lightumbreon|mibbit> got to go
<lightumbreon|mibbit> off to Home
<Isukra> 12lol
<lightumbreon|mibbit> cycling from grandma to home, takes aprox. a hour
<Ascendant> There has to be a balance.
<sklar> 11okay maybe extragtion but still
<lightumbreon|mibbit> BBL by then :3
<Isukra> 12a funny way to think of it though
<Isukra> 12is that if there werre no laws
<eXAKR> I just watched the entire Fox News brony thing
<Isukra> 12how many criminals would there be?
<eXAKR> I think my head is now flat from all the facepalming, headdesking, etc.
<Espeon> 06see ya LU
<Espeon> 06It's fox news
<Espeon> 06and it's the media
<Espeon> 06they like scandals
<lightumbreon|mibbit> faux news
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ew
<Isukra> 12show me the car fax
<Espeon> 06And yes, there has to be a balance
<eXAKR> I thought that Anonymous stuff and ObamaBashing was bad enough
<eXAKR> This
<Isukra> 12!exakr
*eXAKR now belongs to Isukra for 15 minutes
<Espeon> 06and until we learn to keep that on our own without laws holding our hand (read: never), then removing them would lead to quite a bit of oddness.
<eXAKR> Makes me want to jump train platforms
<Espeon> 06I'm not sure if they have but if not, I'd love to see Fox News do a report on furries.
*Espeon dies
<Isukra> 12don't die
<Isukra> 12eXAKR would never forgive me
<Espeon> 06It would be so facepalm-worthy I bet
<Ascendant> oh god no
<Ascendant> [21:00:27] <%Isukra> a funny way to think of it though
<Ascendant> [21:00:31] <%Isukra> is that if there werre no laws
<Ascendant> [21:00:32] <eXAKR> I just watched the entire Fox News brony thing
<Ascendant> [21:00:37] <%Isukra> how many criminals would there be?
<Ascendant> That is the point though
<Espeon> 06hell they would probably screw up a report on trains or something
<Espeon> 06and inb4 "no laws, no criminals"
<Ascendant> the law defines what crime is
<Ascendant> lmao time
<Ascendant> ing
<Ascendant> timing
<eXAKR> What
<Espeon> 06That reminds me of a troll physics strip where he reduces crime rate by burning the laws
<Espeon> 06I must say that arguement is in my opinion silly :B
<Ascendant> ._.
<Ascendant> Well
<Ascendant> Right and wrong is defined by opinion alone
<Jazza> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/130811898765.png
<Ascendant> Whether something is socially acceptable is an entirely different thing
<Jazza> Bored, browsing pony images
<Ascendant> Now that is defined by law
<Espeon> 06well yeah, social norms can control things to a certain extent but
<sklar> 11okay got to go to sleep maybe i don't fucking know so goodnight or Goodrich thats what the damn correct thought it was i mean how the fuck did my jumble of leaders look like goodrich fuck you correction system i may be bad but not that bad i mean what bullshit ah fuck i just saying whats in my head like anyone gives shit we right so horrable crappy today th
<Ascendant> In a way, laws are the "Majority Rules"
<Espeon> 06no actual laws (no matter how flawed laws can be) still would lead to more chaos than anything else.
<Balloons> i'm trying to find a good screensaver atm.
<Ascendant> But yes, that's true.
<Espeon> 06Well I'm sure the majority of us doesn't want it to be totally okay that someone stabs your best friend to death, right?
<Ascendant> As I said there has to be a balance
<eXAKR> Which was the MLP:FiM episode with the baked bads
<Ascendant> Well true
<eXAKR> I need to make a reaction picture to that Fox News video
<Ascendant> But in a world without laws
<eXAKR> Using a shot of Pinkie's sick face
<Ascendant> Everyone would have to learn to fight for themselves
<Ascendant> Survival of the fittest
<eXAKR> Ascendant: yeah
<eXAKR> Again, Somalia
<sklar> 11that it dosent matter what you right unless your a grrammar nazi then fuck you and shit what am i even thinking about i guess i should stop wrighting but i don't care i do what i want south park
<Espeon> 06See, I get what you mean and all but still.
<Ascendant> definitely not a perfect world, per se
<Ascendant> not ideal either
<Espeon> 06Well nothing is perfect or really ideal
<Ascendant> That's true
<Archfiend> bbl
<Ascendant> bbl
<Espeon> 06Alright
<sklar> 11i some times think would i have sex with a pony and then i'm like maybe no i don't know i guess i see as more of a love thing maybe if i grew to know one well enough maybe i would eventually trie
<sklar> 11i mean if you love some thing enough why shouldn't you i what
<sklar> 11i got to go to sleep
<sklar> 11soooo bye bn bn bnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnvc
<Jazza> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/130832566775.png
<sklar> 11byye love bronie
<Mimezinga> hi there, can i ask something? what is the fuss about fox news and bronies?
<Jazza> I don't know
<Jazza> Don't watch Fox News
<Jazza> Google it?
<Mimezinga> i tried to find something googling it but i found just a lot of rant
<Jazza> Hmmm
<SweetieBelle> That crap shouldnt be allowe to be called news though
<JackiePie> They aren't
<SweetieBelle> Maybe it makes bronies feel self conscious
<Mimezinga> yeah, like this, but i still miss the facts
<JackiePie> Only called news by Faux
<JackiePie> The problem is our society is still so homophobic, men displaying any level of femininity or interest in female things scares them.
<JackiePie> This wouldn't be an issue in Japan.
<Mimezinga> japan has a different way of dealig with these things...
<JackiePie> How so?
<Mimezinga> here in italy it's not a good idea beeing homo and proud of it, especially in some specific cities
<Mimezinga> oh i think it's just a different cultural approach
<Thaluka> The fuck did all this "bronies are umeployed" shit come from?
<Mimezinga> in verona, italy, the approach was actually a beating to death
<Mimezinga> can't remember the year, but not that much ago
<Jazza> God damnit, I hate when news shows and the shit decide to have a report on something like this. Happened to planking and it died.
<Thaluka> The Fox segment with the Baby Man only?
<Jazza> Excuse the language
<SweetieBelle> I am glad the world is changing.
<SweetieBelle> Being a brony is less of an issue for me, being female.
<JackiePie> Mimeezinga what about the Visual Kei bands?
<JackiePie> Are they just considered like Marilyn Manson here?
<Mimezinga> don't even know who they are
<Mimezinga> googling
<JackiePie> If religious people stopped being so childish about homosexuality this wouldn't be an issue.
<JackiePie> Look up Malice Mizer
<JackiePie> Hi
<Mimezinga> well, now... that's just bad taste...
<SweetieBelle> I believe people often like to put others down to make themselves feel better.. pretty pathetic, and that wont change anytime soon
<JackiePie> really, but they're so pretty?
<JackiePie> lol
<JackiePie> Sweetiebell I've been having an issue with such a pathetic person at DerpyChat for the past week.
<Mimezinga> really, i can't even say what they are... exhibitionists, i guess?
<SweetieBelle> A pony doing that? :(
<JackiePie> how do you pm here?
<SweetieBelle> type /msg name message
<GordonFreeman> Bonk.
<JackiePie> Yup
<JackiePie> got it!
<JackiePie> What's up Johnsey?
<JackiePie> lalala
<Mimezinga> mh, nightly round up brings weird news.... valve was conquered by the magic of friendship...
<Anonpony> indeed! this is encouraging
<JackiePie> Wuts valve?
<johnsey> JackiePie: not much
<GordonFreeman> GABEN
<Mimezinga> well, if we are lucky they'll put some pwnies easter egg here and there...
<GordonFreeman> GABEN PONY
<GordonFreeman> THE FATTEST PONY EVER
<Thaluka> Valve make anything besides Portal and TF2?
<GordonFreeman> Hat Simulator 2*
<Mimezinga> they run steam and on a certain level encourage indie productions....
<JackiePie> I woke up with one of those headaches that feel like someone lodged an ice pick in your brain.
<JackiePie> It's going away I think.
<GordonFreeman> I always wake up with a hangover.
<Thaluka> I hate Steam =/
<JackiePie> It's not from drinking though
<Mimezinga> why?
<Thaluka> Had to get it just to play Empire Total War....OFFLINE
<Mimezinga> why you hate steam, i mean
<Mimezinga> oh ok
<Mimezinga> even dawn of war 2 requires steam
<Anonpony> Steam is very useful but also annoyingly intrusive and restrictive
<Thaluka> You can pirate games, and run them without Steam, but if you buy them legit you have to screw around with it
<Anonpony> the worst are those games that need you to be running bot Stam and Live, bah
<Mimezinga> actually, i can live with it, because i'm saving some bucks trough steam store
<johnsey> !mbox read 1
<JackiePie> That's like rewarding you for piracy.
<JackiePie> ARRGH
<Thaluka> Yes
<johnsey> wrong channel
<Gordon_Freeman> It's either that or Microsoft.
<SweetieBelle> JackiePie: So did I.. what a way to spoil a night of dreaming about ponies :(
<JackiePie> Funny thing when I went to bed I was dreaming of ponies, and I was like "I have been spending too much time on brony chat"
<Mimezinga> well, actually i don't pirate games.... so i'm happy when they are cheap
<Anonpony> fanfic binge last night... running on very few hours sleep today
<Gordon_Freeman> I buy games and then remove the DRM from them.
<JackiePie> I'm going to the mall at noon.
<Mimezinga> it's a hell of a work, i buy them when they are cheap and just installe them from steam and play
<Mimezinga> i don't even need to check for patches
<JackiePie> lol I never thought of that!
<Wlah> horses have saddles so humans can ride them
<Wlah> ponies have ... saddles..? because.. it's fashionable? wut?
<JackiePie> Like fashion has ever made sense.
<Wlah> but where'd they get the idea in the first place? :I
<Mimezinga> look, ponies usually are naked
<Anonpony> true dat, fashion has a logic all of its own
<Mimezinga> a saddle is an improvin in any case
<JackiePie> Horse shows, I imagine
<Anonpony> convergent evolution
<Mimezinga> *improvement
<SweetieBelle> Somewhere to put saddlebags :P
<Wlah> aren't that just shown as straps in the show?
<Mimezinga> and actually theyr dresses are cute, so it's ok
<SweetieBelle> Theres even pony saddles on Secondlife for the bronys there
<Thaluka> Some types of saddles are lingerie
<JackiePie> So are the human avatars wearing saddles, or are people wearing them as ponies?
<SweetieBelle> Ponies from Bronyville can wear them :P They are merely fashionable. (Theres proper pony avatars)
<JackiePie> I'm not surprised about lingere saddles, people will find a way to sexualize almost anything on the internet
<Thaluka> Even in the show, Spike is going through Twilight's drawers and grabs a blue frilly saddle out of one
<JackiePie> lol
<JackiePie> What episode did that happen in?
<BiiiiigMacintosh> Sweet freedom...morning everypony. ^.^
<JackiePie> Hi
<Thaluka> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw8dBLlf3lo
<Thaluka> 10:17
<Thaluka> Oh she left =/
<eXAKR> http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=7123.0
<eXAKR> See my reply
<JackiePie> I had a browser derp
<JackiePie> Hi
<BiiiiigMacintosh> Welcome back
<JackiePie> Thanks
<Espeon> 06seems like it's time to taskkill firefox first .-.
<Espeon> 06And you're totally not being the kind of "brony" that people find obnoxious by posting pony reaction images. totally not.
<lightumbreon> back
<lightumbreon> i had to break in into my own house
<lightumbreon> key wouldn't fit
<lightumbreon> lucky i know HOW to break in :P
<Espeon> 06~~
<eXAKR> I smell sacarsm
<eXAKR> Seriously, not all bronies are like what Fox is saying
<eXAKR> I could say a sizable number of them are normal people
<Sneas> NS
<Espeon> 06Of course not
<Espeon> 06Fox always finds the most extreme example of anything
<eXAKR> Espeon
<eXAKR> I posted pony images only because it concerns ponies
<eXAKR> If it's something else, it may or may not be ponies
<eXAKR> Depending on how suitable the image was
<Espeon> 06I know that, it was somewhat sarcastic :P
<SilverSonic> UGH more pony talk x.x
<lightumbreon> ohai SS
<SilverSonic> why cant that crap fad die already
<lightumbreon> O.o
<lightumbreon> chill out...please
<SilverSonic> ;p
<eXAKR> Who? Me?
*SilverSonic slaps eXAKR around a bit with a MASSIVE WRENCH!
<Wlah> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25745
<SilverSonic> him? yes.
*SilverSonic flees
*lightumbreon facepaws
*BiiiiigMacintosh snickers.
<SilverSonic> ;D
<eXAKR> I forgot SilverSonic was on my ignore list
<SilverSonic> ;p
*lightumbreon sights
<lightumbreon> SILVER, eXAKR
<lightumbreon> GET ALONG
<lightumbreon> NOW
<SilverSonic> Nou
<lightumbreon> BE FREIND
<lightumbreon> SHARE COOKIES
<SilverSonic> -caps
<lightumbreon> i f*cked that up, didn't i?
<SilverSonic> mhmmm
<Jazza> Is it just me or is it weird singing "everyone" in Winter Wrap Up
<Ascendant> wat
<Ascendant> eXAKR, do tell me you know that a brony is technically a pony furry, amirite?
<Archfiend> hey Sneas
<Wlah> ahhh the ultimate showdown in pony version http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo&feature=player_embedded
<eXAKR> Dunno
<eXAKR> You know, I was thinking
<Jazza> OMG
<eXAKR> All of the MLP:FiM main characters have jobs
<SilverSonic> --.-
<eXAKR> Except Twilight, who's a student
<Wlah> apple optimus prime WIN
<eXAKR> So Fox News cooking that up... yup, no sense
<Caaz> WHY YOU NO HI ME.
<Caaz> I am unimportant.
<Caaz> I see how it is.
<Caaz> FINE.
*Caaz idles.
<eXAKR> Rarity has her own boutique, Pinkie works in the cake shop, Applejack on her family farm, Fluttershy kind of runs her own animal shelter, and Rainbow Dash is mostly in charge of the weather.
<Espeon> 06and this is relevant to anything why?
<SilverSonic> ^
<Ascendant> Oh, look at my care cup. It's empty.
<lightumbreon> xD
*eXAKR fills it with water
<SilverSonic> XD
<Ascendant> water != care
<eXAKR> Now you will care
<SilverSonic> ;p
*eXAKR replaces it with care
*SilverSonic drinks the water and spits it
*SilverSonic RUND
*SilverSonic RUNS*
<eXAKR> ...
<Espeon> 06I mean sometimes I feel like people do not use a pony channel just because they enjoy people complaining about it
<Espeon> 06I can see the appeal personally but
<Espeon> 06Because tears taste delicious, but still
<Espeon> 06And i did not say that's the reason, it just sometimes feels like it ;P
<eXAKR> Maybe because not too many people know about it
<Ascendant> eXAKR, no matter how hard you try you're not going to get me to care enough to actually bother to join you.
<eXAKR> Join me as in what?
<Ascendant> I will respect that you like ponies, but please, stop trying to rub it into everyone's face...
<Ascendant> Not everyone cares about ponies, k?
<eXAKR> ...
<Espeon> 06He's not exactly rubbing it in everyone's faces I'd say, but I get what you mean still :P
<Sneas> Rape
<Archfiend> ohai Caaz
<Caaz> Yay.
<Ascendant> Well, not rub
<Ascendant> But shove it, literally
<eXAKR> there has to be a more obvious pony channel
<BiiiiigMacintosh> This...this is awesome. XD
<eXAKR> #ponies
<eXAKR> prince-dari
<eXAKR> You there?
<eXAKR> Ascendant
<Ascendant> Do it, I really would prefer if you guys talked your stuff in there instead of here >:
<Espeon> 06I do think that someone interested in it and such should be making it though
<Archfiend> xD
<eXAKR> You find this annoying why?
<Sneas> Jt
<Ascendant> What Xeli said, and eXAKR
<Espeon> 06And I'm personally not annoyed o.O. The only thing a little bit odd is that sometimes things are posted as if everyone cares about it.
<Ascendant> It's not so much as MLP being annoying but as to the people who like it being annoying
<SilverSonic> ^
<Ascendant> And I basically find what Xeli finds odd annoying
<Ascendant> The ponies being posted as if everyone in the whole wide world actually cares
<Espeon> 06I mean, maybe it could recruit more forum-goers to join irc too, there's quite a few pony people there..
*Espeon hides
<Ascendant> lmao
<Gordon_Freeman> I eat crowbars.
<eXAKR> well
<eXAKR> Ascendant, you got to admit it's explosively popular
<eXAKR> I see a classic in the making
<SilverSonic> which it shouldnt be
*SilverSonic runs
<Espeon> 06¨No one denies that it's popular
<Plasterduck> At least you'll never have an iron deficiency
<eXAKR> Along the lines of Pokémon, Looney Tunes, Tom & Jerry, etc.
<SilverSonic> No.
<Ascendant> Yeah, well, we're not denying it
<SilverSonic> Just No.
<eXAKR> It will die down, but will remain as a classic
<Ascendant> But that doesn't mean that everyone cares
<eXAKR> sigh
<Espeon> 06It's the way that sometimes youtube links and equestria daily or whatever they're called-links are posted as if this IS #ponies.
<Ascendant> The thing is, you're posting the pony stuff just like everyone in this channel cares about it
<SilverSonic> I really dont think it will go with those cartoons
<SilverSonic> maybe something more low level
<SilverSonic> ;p
<eXAKR> I don't know who doesn't care about it!
<Ascendant> I don't.
<eXAKR> I know SilverSonic is one
<Ascendant> drf doesn't
<Espeon> 06And see, I'm not saying that ponies shouldn't be allowed in this channel.
<Ascendant> I'm pretty sure only prince-dari and you kind of care
<Espeon> 06But it's obvious that there's enough content to be shared that a channel for it is pretty much natural.
<SilverSonic> just keep the pony talk to a very very minimum
<Ascendant> derp
<eXAKR> SilverSonic
<eXAKR> It WILL become a classic
<eXAKR> Annoying as it may be
<SilverSonic> NOT with those cartoons
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, lol
<SilverSonic> if im being honest it doest deserve to be in the same group as those ones
<eXAKR> I see this as going through the same phase as when Pokémon got too popular and the hating started
<Ascendant> At the moment I think drf and you and HML
<Ascendant> Need to tone the pony hating down too
<Ascendant> I'm going to do that
<SilverSonic> oh christ
<Ascendant> But seriously, just join #ponyhaters or what not
<Ascendant> Start a bloody war between #ponies and #ponyhaters or something
<Ascendant> :D
<SilverSonic> lmao no...just no.
<eXAKR> I'm not that stupid
<Ascendant> I know you aren't
<Ascendant> I was kidding
<Espeon> 06I'm not even pony-hating. I can appreciate the production value and the positive things of the show, I've tried watching it, but I did not get hooked or interested whatosever o3o
<Espeon> 06That is all I have to say from my viewpoint anywho
<SilverSonic> EW THAT FACE
<eXAKR> I simply love the humour and some of the characters
*SilverSonic RUNS
<Espeon> 06And /me flops is seriously programmed into my muscle memory :<
<eXAKR> SilverSonic you are being really annoying, I hope you know that
<SilverSonic> re add me to ignore?
<lightumbreon> eXAKR, SS
<eXAKR> You call me annoying, but you need to look at yourself in the mirror first
<SilverSonic> oh god not again
<lightumbreon> stop discussing, please
<Ascendant> Okay, shut up
<Espeon> 06SS you're the reason there are pony fans who are like "every forum is ponychan"
<lightumbreon> ^
<Espeon> 06the reactions
<Ascendant> Derp.
<SilverSonic> >.>
<SilverSonic> im not the only one that hates it as much as me
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, I have made it clear that you are unfunny, you try too hard (even more than me), and so on
<Ascendant> But really
<Espeon> 06Even though I wish that the ones who think like that should DIAF but that's another story
<Ascendant> You can be cool when you're not being those things
<Ascendant> ;p
<eXAKR> DIAF?
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> die in a fire
<SilverSonic> NS you're not funny half the time anyways
<Ascendant> @ eXAKR
<Ascendant> SilverSonic that's the point
<Ascendant> Read what I said
<Espeon> 06die in a fire, not literally of course but I find the "pony spammers" extremely obnoxious.
<Pori> hi?
<Ascendant> lmao
<eXAKR> Those are too far, yes
<Espeon> 06Yes
<lightumbreon> everyone just shut up! pony chatter is not illigial or something in #Silverwings, but ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, ok, i'm not a hater or anything, but people find this annoying, there is a seperate Channel for this, if needed, USE IT, do not go around annoying the living crap out of everyone, END OF RANT
<SilverSonic> o-o
<Espeon> 06It all just comes down to
<eXAKR> But it's not like I'm spamming ponies to the point of Cubing or anything
<eXAKR> and oO
<Ascendant> lightumbreon lol
<eXAKR> You have to admit
<Ascendant> That was a bit extreme
<eXAKR> People have crossed ponies with EVERYTHING.
<BiiiiigMacintosh> 'lo there.
<Espeon> 06All I'm really saying is that I don't see why there's not a #ponysomething channel. I mean, it would be more fun discussing ponies with like-minded people without all the complaints and such.
<SilverSonic> >_>
<eXAKR> Almost
<Espeon> 06The pony fandom is certainly
<Espeon> 06creative
<Espeon> 06no doubt .-.
<eXAKR> The problem is, not too many people going there
<Pori> 8D
<eXAKR> #bronyclub or otherwise
<lightumbreon> then i'll go there!
<lightumbreon> rant against me
<Pori> whassup?
<Espeon> 06Well the people who do not care about the links doesn't count as people in this regard (if you get what I mean), so not like there's more people here :P
<lightumbreon> no problem, as long as nothing goes to #Silverwings of it
<Espeon> 06But I will totally agree that people blow up too easily at the very mention of ponies
<Espeon> 06Now lets just flop over and continue our day~~~
<eXAKR> *coughsscough*
<lightumbreon> yes Espeon
<SilverSonic> >_>
<Wlah> this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo&feature=player_embedded
<Ascendant> I think that's really enough, eXAKR
<lightumbreon> ^
<Ascendant> SilverSonic isn't really wrong lol
<eXAKR> I'm done
<Ascendant> Everyone has their own opinions
<lightumbreon> but too extreme opinions
<lightumbreon> or overly expressing them
<lightumbreon> is annoying
<lightumbreon> and stupid :/
<Pori> lol
<Ascendant> That tends to happen a lot
<eXAKR> bbl getting chips
<Ascendant> k
<eXAKR> funny, I dreamt I still have some potato chips in the freezer last night
<eXAKR> But it's empty when I checked
<lightumbreon> brb, going to get a snack
<Espeon> 06That reminds me of a dream I had as a kid to be honest
<Espeon> 06I dreamt I had this toy, and when I woke up and realized it was a dream I sadface
<Espeon> 06d
<Espeon> 06:P
<Espeon> 06yay realistic dreams?
<lightumbreon> ^
<lightumbreon> o laughed
<Espeon> 06I prefer the insanely surreal ones though
<Ascendant> I have some...interesting ones.
<eXAKR> I once dreamt I had a Lugia plush
<eXAKR> which I really do want
<SilverSonic> The only person who i know that has a ton of plushies is RJ
<eXAKR> And (PONY CONTENT WARNING) last night I dreamt of MLP:FiM figures that are aimed at adults
<eXAKR> oo
<lightumbreon> i once dreamed i had a lifesize one of those plushies, those BIG lugia ones
<eXAKR> Also I found a bag of chips stashed in my home
<eXAKR> :D
<Espeon> 06I got all the wrong images in my head now
<Espeon> 06Anywhoooooooooooooooo
<lightumbreon> i want a lifesize plush Lugia, that would be epic
<eXAKR> what
<SilverSonic> <%Espeon> I got all the wrong images in my head now <-- lmao
<Ascendant> "BIG". My mind.

<lightumbreon|devghfwyejgfdoiuw> i borked my internet
<lightumbreon|devghfwyejgfdoiuw> on purpouse :P

<Balloons> Hello. Masterweaver
<lightumbreon> :3
<SilverSonic> :3
<Masterweaver> Hey there.
<gingerale-> Dear gog. Everything is dubstep. D: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMtcqfQNd2Y&hd=1
<Masterweaver> What is dubstep anyway?
<Masterweaver> Slang for "Remixed into dance music?"
<Masterweaver> Or something more specific?
<gingerale-> It's kind of like two step but more british
<Masterweaver> ...See, if I had legs i might be a litle more knowledgable about your human dancing.
<gingerale-> <3
<gingerale-> Then again I think two step is British too.. Uhh..
<Masterweaver> I'm blank over here.
<gingerale-> It's to electronic dance music what garage punk is to rock music.
<gingerale-> ^^
<SilverSonic> i haz 2 floofcats :3
<gingerale-> Just British
<SilverSonic> lets add a bird
<SilverSonic> !isukra

<Masterweaver> I listen to music for the music, not the genre.
<gingerale-> So? The genre describes what the music is like

<Espeon> 06Hi :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13<3
<gingerale> Labeling things makes communication easier.
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai :3
<gingerale> But it doesn't mean one thing only has one label
<gingerale> One piece of music can be of multiple genres

<Zirman> BEST SONG EVER!
<Jazza> I like that song, but hate the original
<JackiePie> Hi
<Pure_Hatred> Zirman: whcih song is that?
<Zirman> Equestria girls :3
<SweetieBelle> My ringtone :D
<Pure_Hatred> o
<Zirman> Your not a bronie till youv heard it
<Jazza> I showed that to my female friend. She couldn't watch it all :3
<Daffodil> It's too adorable. I can't not-smile while listening.
<Pure_Hatred> Jazza: embarrasment? :p
<Zirman> GO BRONIES!
<SweetieBelle> http://equestriagirls.com/
<Jazza> BRONY POWER
<Daffodil> eeyup.com
<Zirman> Also i heard Katy parry made a parody of that song
<Balloons> she did?
*Jazza adds these sites to his pony bookmarks
<Pure_Hatred> . . . . .
<Dashie|semi-AFK> Yeah she did
<Dashie|semi-AFK> It's called California Gurls
<Daffodil> Yeah. Sad, really. A supposedly talented musical artist taking material from FiM.
<Dashie|semi-AFK> It's far from as good as Equestria Girls
<Daffodil> Supposedly being the key word.
<Jazza> I want more pony websites
<Daffodil> Press the eeyup button again.
<Daffodil> And again.
<Daffodil> And again.
<SweetieBelle> Everythings better with ponies
<Jazza> I've already clicked it a few times
<Jazza> Mooooar
<Pure_Hatred> ... there are no words to describe how much I hate the "so I herd %orig artist% made a parody
<Pure_Hatred> But then I hate everything
<Pure_Hatred> So meh
<Jazza> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10906236/Pony/Characters/Big%20Macintosh/bigmac_013.png

<Pure_Hatred> ~yay~
<Daffodil> http://ganton3.deviantart.com/art/INSTANT-PINKIE-PIE-Flash-211492930
<Zirman> Sorry
<Zirman> had internet probs
<Daffodil> I'm excited for instant Celestia. If it's her saying "Gotcha", I'm so using that in my everyday life.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> http://goo.gl/91PLi

<Jazza> SO AWESOME http://ganton3.deviantart.com/art/INSTANT-RAINBOWDASH-Flash-211317101
<Zirman> Why :(
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Jazza> Zirman you're a bit late
<Zirman> i know
<Zirman> Still
<Jazza> Yeah
<Zirman> I was jsut hoping
<Jazza> I disappoint it
<Zirman> *sigh*
<Zirman> Hey quick question
<Zirman> Are they really making derpy a charater
<Jazza> She is
<Daffodil> Kind of.
<Zirman> No i mean like for season 2
<Jazza> She has been since she was found by fans
<Jazza> I'd say she'll be there
<Zirman> Someone said that derpy was going to be an actual charater
<Daffodil> From what I understand, they're going to use a pony of the same color and stuff as a character
<Daffodil> Not sure what her name will be or if her eyes will be derpy.
<Zirman> Uhh duh
<Barry> Hi, Dari
<Zirman> DERPY
<Jazza> They WILL be Derpy
<Zirman> IS
<Jazza> Or rather they MUST
<Zirman> DERPY
<Zirman> no excuses
<Zirman> no questions asked
<Jazza> I tried watching http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul5yF5vAR9M but couldn't after I heard the water monster... I haven't played that game in a while
<Zirman> what is that game?
<Jazza> Amnesia The Dark Descent
<Jazza> I recommend it
<Dashie|semi-AFK> I shall see you guys in approximately
<Dashie|semi-AFK> ONE hour.

<LoLZorZs> You have no idea
<Angel_Espeon> 13it was 11:48am

<RandomlyWeir> yeah!
<RandomlyWeir> Ok
<Angel_Espeon> 13How about you both learn to tolerate each other
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<RandomlyWeir> so, i put author name and description.
<eXAKR> I won't even care anymore
<RandomlyWeir> Hi line
<NINJAPWNY> oh snap
<Outline> Hello there Weir.
<RandomlyWeir> *high5es*
<NINJAPWNY> an active mod!
<Angel_Espeon> 13And take him off ignore, because that's just silly IMO :P
<RandomlyWeir> Dunn dunn dunn
<Outline> Oh now I wouldn't go so far as to say that :P
<RandomlyWeir> e.o
<eXAKR> He's off
<Soarin> Huh what
<Soarin> oh
<Soarin> im back
<Soarin> i think i fell asleep
<Soarin> i think
<RandomlyWeir> Wat?
<Soarin> im not sure
<Soarin> Hi :)
<RandomlyWeir> Ok, retreats
<Damos> me?
<Angel_Espeon> 13And I think you both need to apologise to each other
<Outline> 'ello there Soarin.
<NINJAPWNY> awww
<Angel_Espeon> 13since you've both obviously done something to upset the other
<Soarin> S'goin on outline
<NINJAPWNY> one less at the par-tay
<Angel_Espeon> 13and we can't have longlasting tension between people, can we? :3
<Soarin> Care to join the par-tay
<Soarin> We have games
<Soarin> and butterbeer
<Soarin> and pie :D
<Soarin> and other assorments
<Outline> Nothing much. Evening. Peaceful. Complete lack of activity.
<Outline> What about on your end?
<Soarin> Long day
<Soarin> Lots of flying
<Soarin> Wings are tired
<Soarin> So i went on here
<UxieLover> 11Hey!
<UxieLover> 11I'm no longer doing pink, plus I removed the numbers from my nick
<Damos> what wrong?
<Soarin> Thats bout it
<eXAKR> All I ask from him is to be less annoying, and learn to tolerate MLP:FiM
<Damos> who was on ignore?
<eXAKR> It's here to stay, like Sonic, Pokémon, etc.
<NINJAPWNY> so its evening over there outline
<Outline> Makes sense. This is as decent a place as any to crash.
<Soarin> But i gotta go later to see my grandpa
<Soarin> Fathers day and all that
<NINJAPWNY> there's barely anyone up over here
<Espeon> 06That's one thing MLP has down, love and tolerance
<Soarin> I didnt crash here
*Espeon flops
<Soarin> I landed
<Outline> Whereabouts is "here" for you Ninja
<Outline> ?
<NINJAPWNY> america
<NINJAPWNY> eastern US
<Outline> Ah.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Tell that to him the next time you see him then :3 Hopefully he'll realise his mistakes and apologise for overreacting to things he doesn't approve of
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll make sure to talk to him myself if he doesn't
<Soarin> As for me im breaking the foruth wall
<Angel_Espeon> 13but on the other hand, maybe it'd be wise for you not to post as much MLP-related content as you have been doing
<Soarin> And derpy has already done that
<Soarin> Along with breaking my computer screen -_-
<Angel_Espeon> 13since I've seen people telling you to stop
<Saphyer> wazzzup?
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<UxieLover> 11DSD?
<eXAKR> Maybe
<Soarin> Nothin much bro
<NINJAPWNY> its a...party
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<eXAKR> I do get obsessed at times

<Saphyer> wanna be friends?
<HyperMetalLugia> So what
<Soarin> PAR-TAY
<Saphyer> ...
<Soarin> Sure why not
<Saphyer> good actor Sorin
<HyperMetalLugia> If someone doesn't like your obsession, don't obsess ;p
<NINJAPWNY> it didnt seem very lively

<NINJAPWNY> so i downgraded
<eXAKR> Like != Obsession, I know
<Saphyer> ikno
<Soarin> Dont forget it bro

<Saphyer> soooo
<Soarin> So?
<Saphyer> do u actually have a mlp fim OC?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I understand, but just try to keep it to a minimum so it doesn't annoy others, 'kay? :P
<eXAKR> They will run its course
<gingerale> So
<eXAKR> K
<Soarin> first time on this site
<gingerale> Luna having a musical number in se2. Would this be awesome? Y/Y
<Soarin> so i have no idea what that is
<lightumbreon> good, problem solved :3
<Soarin> im not even sure how to sign up
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe
<Saphyer> yeah
<Saphyer> how do u sign up?
<Soarin> so
<Angel_Espeon> 13If you really feel the need to post lots of MLP-related content, you could go to the MLP channel and talk about it there :3
<Soarin> do explain what an mlp fim OC is
<Saphyer> ok
<Ali1017> no signing up, you just register your names
<Angel_Espeon> 13The MLP fanclub on the forums works too
<Soarin> Oh
<Soarin> K
<Damos> guys just make up with each
<Soarin> makes sense
<Damos> other

<eXAKR> This isn't active enough D:
<Saphyer> i have one
<Ali1017> basicly a fan made character
<Saphyer> his name is Saphyer
<Soarin> Lemme guess
<Saphyer> yup
<Soarin> ya
<Ali1017> i have one to, named Ali
<eXAKR> Problem is that the channel isn't active enough :(
<Soarin> I want one
<HyperMetalLugia> We could just send him to #Nobodycares ;D
<Soarin> But im not the best at names
<Saphyer> u kan make one
<HyperMetalLugia> Well find more MLP cultists then
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Soarin> Its just the names
<Saphyer> yeah
<Soarin> i can never think of good names
<Angel_Espeon> 13HML, you're not helping :P
<Saphyer> Saphyer is a pegasus
<Soarin> other than jackson or somethin
<HyperMetalLugia> Sorries :<
<Saphyer> little brother of FlutterShy
<Outline> Well... what are your character's defining traits?
<Soarin> I'm a pegasus
<HyperMetalLugia> Have fun with him AE then XD
<Soarin> I know that much
<Soarin> Still need a name
<Soarin> colour
<Ali1017> Mine's a Unicorn
<Outline> I mean personality, likes, dislikes...
<Saphyer> Saphyer has a crush on Rainbow Dash
*HyperMetalLugia is in a bad mood anyway, will idle
<Ali1017> use a pony genorater then
<Soarin> Oh great
<Saphyer> w w w w wait
<Soarin> Ok
<Outline> Basically, take the most notable from those, and craft a name around that.
<Soarin> gimme idea for a name
<Ali1017> who doesn't have a crush on Dash
<Saphyer> theres a pony generator?!?!?!?!!?/
<Archfiend> goodnight
<DSD|sleep> 4Hey
<Soarin> WUT
<Saphyer> I LOVE RD!!!!!!!!!!
<Soarin> SEND!
<Angel_Espeon> 13eXAKR, encourage other MLP fans to join you there when you see them :3
<Soarin> Ok
<Soarin> Uhhhh
<Dashie|semi-AFK> Wow okay
<Ascendant> goodnight
<Soarin> Lemme think
<Saphyer> ok
<Ali1017> there's two that i know of, 1 being better than the other
<eXAKR> K
<Angel_Espeon> 13Goodnight Ascendant ~
<Espeon> 06When a channel isn't active enough it does not need to be kept on life support with random links, be it floof, ponies or butts. It needs conversation. And good night Ascendant :3
<Espeon> 06Advertise it on the forums a bit (in PM's or profiles), maybe some of the pony people there will try IRC then :P
<Soarin> I like flying fast, i know that
<Soarin> dang
<Soarin> so
<Ali1017> *rummages* hang on, i'll find my character
<gingerale> I have a whole bunch of original characters. But I haven't named them since the players will mostly do that.
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Soarin> what about this pony genertor?
<eXAKR> \I think one reason why I'm so into this is that such a good cartoon, with good character design (and I don't mean by just their looks) and such good humour and storytelling hasn't come along in a very, very long time
<eXAKR> Anyway
<eXAKR> Espeon
<Saphyer> idk
<eXAKR> I will take your idea
<HyperMetalLugia> Nii
<Fireant> Hello ruffians!
<Ascendant> Well eXAKR, I think the people who have seen it know that and either agree or disagree
<ZekeS> Good afternoon Fireant
<NINJAPWNY> ah!
<Soarin> link to pony generator plz
<Ali1017> oh hello fireant
<NINJAPWNY> another mod!
<Angel_Espeon> 13I understand, I like the show myself :P
<Soarin> if there is a link
<lightumbreon> nighties Ascendant
<Ascendant> The people who don't will make the decision themselves
<Saphyer> wait
<Saphyer> this Soarein person
<Saphyer> yur actually a real person?
<Barry> Hi Dash
<Ascendant> Either you prompt them or your don't
<NINJAPWNY> and i have no idea what my pwny would look like
<UxieLover> 11Like the new me?
<eXAKR> Understood
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's the spamming of MLP-related content that's one of the main reasons I don't like the fanbase so much
<Ali1017> there's a link to one on EqD somewhere, under the games search
<eXAKR> I won't force them
<Ascendant> Pretty much what Angel_Espeon
<Ascendant> said
<Saphyer> mine is a Sapphire pegasus
<Saphyer> his mark is raindrops
<Saphyer> b5br
<Soarin> damn
<eXAKR> Just as long as they don't force me not to like the show, I will leave them alone
<Outline> oh, hey there Fireant.
<Soarin> i wish i was good at pony makin like that
<eXAKR> I won't shove it down their throats either
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm sure no one will do that, everyone has a right to like whatever they want after all
<Soarin> AH HA
<Soarin> i think i got a name
<Soarin> i think
<Soarin> Citrus?
<Soarin> i dunno
<UxieLover> 11I've removed the numbers from my nick-name, plus I've become blue.
<Soarin> something to do with fire or the sun
<Outline> That's a viable name.
<Soarin> thats what im basing it around
<Soarin> viable?
<Jazza> Pony generator? There's a create-your-own pony flash tool
<Ascendant> goodnight anyway
<Outline> Decent. Workable.
<DSD|sleep> 4Nice
<Soarin> can i have a link to that PLEASE!
<Espeon> 06Yeah Angel_Espeon , not everyone realizes that :<
<Ali1017> ugh, make me look for it, fine, give me a few mins

<Revolver> If anything, money for school supplies.
<Nickario> oh
<Shaico> his parents suck. that's my theory
<Ray||Homework> 02So you'll have to wait for the next show. Hosted by Green Yoshi later today.
<Nickario> whoops sorry xD
<Revolver> And the field of work for such people isn't.... uh... TOO vast.

<DSD> 4The way i have seen it it looks like they are trying to make different pages for teh games
<DSD> 4AS seen on the SL page
<Revolver> Freaky is in Equestria After Dark.
<Revolver> Here is for non-sensical stuff.
<NINJAPWNY> yea
<Revolver> Like NINJAPWNY for example.
<DSD> 4Also someone needs admin
<DSD> 4So we can fix it up
<NINJAPWNY> w00t
<Retsamoreh> Yesterday we were talking about nukes.
<Revolver> or sensical stuff, join Equestria Study.
<NINJAPWNY> speaking of which
<Revolver> *For
<DSD> 4You take care of being an admin hopefully you can get it faster
<User_9568> Equestria After Dark? Another website I never knew about?

<Revolver> Yesterday there was a war.
<Revolver> ^ A chatroom.
<NINJAPWNY> i have yet to see the flood of duke nukem pwnies since the game came out
<Revolver> The banhammer was even brought out.

<gingerale> I like Study <3
<NINJAPWNY> hey, fireants busted out the banhammer like 3 times since ive been on
<NINJAPWNY> that things frikkin mjolnir
<Revolver> For sensical stuff, but with acting, join RP.
<UxieLover> 11Yeah, but (with the exeption of Honey Marsh) all the old worlds in SL are the same as the classic ones.
<Fireant> I am also thinking about fourth...
<Revolver> Chzo Mythos!
<Revolver> Like Cthulu Mythos, except with VOWELS.
<gingerale> Y is a vowel
<UxieLover> 11I follow the story.
<gingerale> Sometimes
<Revolver> Shut it.
<gingerale> ;_;
<NINJAPWNY> but he shows up late to meetings?
<Revolver> He barely shows up to meeting at all.

<Revolver> Dude, get a name.
<User_9568> One Last Day just made me laugh my butt off
<Aurora> 6I said no comment to sheena
<Revolver> This 'user' crap is annoying me.
<Fireant> Fanfics; 95% of them are utter shit, unreadable, self-inerts, or simply dumb.
<User_9568> nah, too lazy
<SheenaFox> hi Angel :D
<Fireant> 5% howver, are pure gold.
<Revolver> Nevermind, I got to go for an hour.
<lightumbreon> i was too slow with the ^
<Ali1017> finding them, is the challenge
<lightumbreon> :/
<NINJAPWNY> like CUPCAKES
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Revolver> Memories of days Long past was good.
<User_9568> I go by the star rating

<NINJAPWNY> theres a reason its legend
<User_9568> I read the higher rated oned
<Roleplay4life> 5Okay that was weird. xD; Sorry guys.
<Fireant> Cupcakes is utter shit. Boring, senslessly gory like american splatterhouse.
<User_9568> the human in equestria one, "Stuck" is my favorite
<Roleplay4life> 5I accidentally closed the Channel window and was like !!!!!!!O:
<Fireant> All the Six-Stars are worth the reading. Most of 5-Stars too, however not always.
<Aurora> 6lol
<Roleplay4life> 5AHEM ANYWAYS.
<DSD|Wikimaker> 4Wiki
<lightumbreon> i said, being floofed is a good thing
<DSD|Wikimaker> 4Also i'm not sure they know we are here
<DSD|Wikimaker> 4if they do they might be on
<Roleplay4life> 5So is anyone stateside doing anything nice for their dad today..?
<lightumbreon> i gave him aftershave
<lightumbreon> but i once trolled him on fathersday
<Fireant> Also, I am sad, WE are sad, that whenever anyone throw the topic "Fanfics" it takes less than 10 second to somepony mention Cupcakes.
<User_9568> Yeah that's true, but man am I addicted to TheGoldenCrowbar's Dr. Whoof fics
<lightumbreon> i gave him pink underwear

<lightumbreon> *socks
<Fireant> ^^
<Roleplay4life> 5I gave my dad a card and a book about all kinds of guitars and basses, 'cause he's cool like that. I marked the Rickenbacker 4001 Bass and he was like, "D: I want thaaaat"
<Fireant> NINJAPWNY, only for troll.
<User_9568> Cupcakes, never read it
<Roleplay4life> 5LOL
<Fireant> I ban trolls.
<gingerale> If someone really thinks there should be a feminine version of the word "Brony" could it just be "Bronie"?
<Roleplay4life> 5PINK SOCKS XD
<NINJAPWNY> and EVERY time someone brings it up, i am going to mention it
<User_9568> I think it should be Sisney XD
<Fireant> User_9568, you may - its not badly written. It's only senseless and therefore, yawny.
<NINJAPWNY> trollface.jpg
<Fireant> Not for long Ninja.
<Roleplay4life> 5Apparently my gift was more like torture though because it's a book about all the guitars used by pros he'll never be able to afford. xD;; Nyeeeh.
<Fireant> I must now tell you that you are on mods black list.

<Roleplay4life> 5Okay, well I'm going to grab some lunch. Back in a bit.
<Hamcha> Chanserv's a good guy, uh?
<Raphael> So no discussion on any other subjects aside from banning?

<ZekeS> Ponies with banhammer cutie marks?
<NINJAPWNY> YES
<Retsamoreh> Oooh you get a present if you're on the good-guy list?

<Angel_Espeon> 13I assume it is, anyway
<Retsamoreh> I caught a few of them when I first watched them.
<Retsamoreh> Like Scootaloo's random missing wings.
<Free> It's Flash, there's going to be errors.
<Hamcha> Yeah Fireant, like if i didn't know that the owner of the chan has actually the mode +i set, so we can't see him.
<Espeon> 06I guess I am in the equalient o.o
<Raphael> god, I can't believe I missed those
<Hamcha> +invisible :yup:
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 10 minutes
<Hamcha> ..that was really bad, i apologize
<Aurora> 6ok
<Hamcha> and i apologize for not having a rim shot ready.
<Nickario> hey roara
<Aurora> 6anyone know what a grade card is
<Raphael> so anyone else going to say anything at all or did everyone freeze?
<NINJAPWNY> no
<Shaico> Stop
<NINJAPWNY> i am here, as always
<Shaico> Hammatime
<User_4456> I just joined this soo...
<NINJAPWNY> NO
<Shaico> change your nick
<Raphael> you're not missing much
<Retsamoreh> I'm here. I'm normally silent.
<Hamcha> Raphael: SubZero did a nice work, didn't he?
<NINJAPWNY> but deadly
<Shaico> /nick to change
<User_4456> Oky dokey
<NINJAPWNY> loki
<Shaico> /nick "username"
<Raphael> I was gonna say Batmare missed out on catching Mr. Freeze
<NINJAPWNY> good job
<Shaico> lol no u put your username you want in that field
<username> XD
<Hamcha> i bet that was Fireant.
<NINJAPWNY> now ur slightly less anonymous
<Raphael> I sense trolling to come along XD
<Shaico> you're half the name of a guy we know
<Shaico> oh great
<Nero> There we go.
<Shaico> phew
<Nickario> from pokemon you mean?
<Raphael> darn, that was anti-climactic
<Shaico> i was worried for a sec. Do you realize how hard it would be to talk to you.
<Nickario> o-o
<Fireant> Hamcha, why would you assume so!
<Shaico> "hey i know a's grandaughter"
<Aurora> 6no, from college lol
<Nero> Yeah, XD
<Hamcha> Someone should be at least SOP to do that.
<DSD|Wikimaker> 4Spree
<Angel_Espeon> 13I haven't heard of one before, sorry D:
<Aurora> 6exactly
<Aurora> 6I haven't even heard of it
<Aurora> 6and
<Fireant> Nope.
<Aurora> 6I'm supposed to have one faxed to my college tomorrow
<Fireant> OP is enough.
<UxieLover> 11Done with Dark Mine
<Fireant> ;) See?
<Fireant> ZekeS is having his trollfun :p
<Nero> So wahddya guys normally talk about here?
<NINJAPWNY> EVERYTHING
<Dashie|semi-AFK> Ponies.
<NINJAPWNY> pwnies
<Nero> Okay...
<Raphael> keep it PG yo
<NINJAPWNY> yea, we're not into clopping
<Nero> Suicidal Ponies?
<Raphael> little child comes in "Mommy what are these peoples talking aboot?"
<Nero> Or is that not PG? =S
<Aurora> 6heck
<NINJAPWNY> depends
<Aurora> 6GOOGLING what it is doesn't even help
<NINJAPWNY> do the mods have to dust off the banhammers?
<Nero> Hmmm....
<Fireant> PG.
<Nero> ^?
<SillyNilly> Banhammers are sanitized frequently. Please keep it clean
<eXAKR> Grade card
<Raphael> Mom "MY CHILD HAS SEEN TOO MUCH! GET AWAY FRM HER!"
<Fireant> Strict PG for you.
<eXAKR> A card that records your grades?
<Fireant> And you.
<Fireant> And all of you.
<SillyNilly> Oh hi
<Aurora> 6yeh but that could be anything
<Nero> Hi
<Aurora> 6they say it's unofficial
<Shaico> if you want more "naughty" stuff, go to "EquestraAfterDark"
<NINJAPWNY> ohai
<Shaico> but it's dead now
<NINJAPWNY> yea
<Raphael> is that a website?
<NINJAPWNY> but normally its the wild west in there
<Nero> I remain confused.
<Shaico> It's another channel
<Aurora> 6but does that really mean I can just print out my grades from my college's online system
<Raphael> EquestriaAfterDark?
<Aurora> 6that seems horribly...not official
<Shaico> /join "Channelnamehere"
<gingerale> #EquestriaAfterDark <-- Double click it
<Shaico> or do that
<Raphael> dear god, the horror!
<Raphael> the things they are saying in there!
<Raphael> it's unnatural!
<Nero> Whaddafu-
<Raphael> it's unethical!
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd make a table with my subjects and put my grades in, print it out and send it to them o3o See what happens from there
<Aurora> 6I have an issue with that last part xD
<Aurora> 6tomorrow is the deadline lol
<Fireant> Well.
<NINJAPWNY> yea!
<Fireant> That is why EAD is EAD.
<Fireant> And minors or persons with barely scratched sanity should stay... right,*draw an X* here.
<Nero> Ya see, EAD is only used in EXTREME cases of... (Trying to think of PG word)
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, it's their own fault for not explaining what exactly a grade card is~
<NINJAPWNY> clop?
<Shaico> inb4 ninja kicked
<Nero> XD
<Aurora> 6I knowwwwww ;-;
<Mongoose> Yo
<Nero> YOU MUST -
<Shaico> hah jk the PG here means no EXCESSIVE swearing and stuff
<SillyNilly> Adult oriented chat, pretty much.
<Nero> Ohhh, ok
<NINJAPWNY> yea
<Nero> *YOU MUST DIE
<Shaico> i can still say horny once in a while here and won't get kicked.
<NINJAPWNY> we're professionals here, dangit
<RandomlyWeir> hai
<Shaico> Fireant I know what you're thinking

<IceMane> YOU CANT IGNORE THIS!
<Fireant> Oh my.
<disney> its me disney
<Fireant> Muted channel.
<Fireant> How sad.
*DSD|Codemaster 4pulls out his code gun
*DSD|Codemaster 4charges it
<Fireant> People, less spamming, fast-enters and "LOOOOOOOOOL", more actual conversation.
<Nero> Cool
<Ray||Homework> 02Hi~
<Nightboomfer> ...yay
<NINJAPWNY> *gasp*
<RandomlyWeir> uh?
<RandomlyWeir> what did you...
<Shaico> >Fireant talking to himself
<Shaico> entertaining
<NINJAPWNY> the chat death choke
<NINJAPWNY> +m
<Retsamoreh> If you had to take any one from the mane six on a dangerous adventure, who would it be?
<DJMidli> IceMane oh hi
<Nightboomfer> Twilight Sparkle
<RandomlyWeir> did he ignored everything?
<Shaico> Rainbow Dash
<RandomlyWeir> Fluttershy
<Nightboomfer> she'd be pretty knowledgeable on most things and have powerful enough magic to stop it
<DJMidli> honestly i wish you tards would stop typic in constant bold like Nero and RandomlyWeir...
<Nero> Might i ask why RandomlyWeir always speaks in bold?
<RandomlyWeir> BEcause i can
<NINJAPWNY> cause hes that awesome
<DJMidli> it honestly screams LOOK AT ME IM IN BOLD LOOKIT ME I NEED ATTENTION LIKE TRIXIE
<Shaico> because he wants attention
<Nickario> lol pateish xD
<disney> gyarados and snorlax are battling
<RandomlyWeir> *deal with it*
<Nightboomfer> Therefore the best course of action would be to ignore him
<Retsamoreh> To answer my own question, Pinkie Pie.
<Nero> DJMidli i was testing to see if it worked.
<Nero> I thought Bold would have been restricted to mods
<The_Great_And> f
<WindBlown> What's going on here?
<The_Great_And> dammit
<DJMidli> ponies
<NINJAPWNY> pwnies
<WindBlown> except ponies :P
<Nightboomfer> Pinkie would make even the gloomiest adventure into a fun time
<Lucas> And so.
<Fireant> We don't do such restrictions.
<Lucas> Anyone doing fine here?
<RandomlyWeir> ._.
<Fireant> We are easy going bunch, we are.
<RandomlyWeir> yeas
<Retsamoreh> No, I need Pinkie Pie so I can break the laws of physics.
<Retsamoreh> Duuuh.

<WindBlown> What is the forth wall anyway?
<Nightboomfer> the audience

<WindBlown> Engage?
<Ray||Osu> 02DS Taiko > Osu's Taiko.
<Retsamoreh> Apparently the Twilight Sparkle zone is a zone where nopony talks.

<Nickario> CONFOUND THOSE COLLEGES, THEY DRIVE ME TO DRINK!
<WindBlown> :D
<DSD|Codemaster> 4http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Elite_Enemies
<DSD|Codemaster> 4thats how those work
<Nightboomfer> Pony Star wars. I'm thinking Twilight as Luke, Angel and Spike as R2 and 3Po, Rainbow dash as han
<Nightboomfer> Rarity as leia
<Marnax> oooh.
<Nightboomfer> Applejack as Chewbacca?
<Aurora> 6lol
<disney> old disney is awsome
<Marnax> Secretly, The Marnaxes join the rebel alliance.
<Fireant> Cool idea.
<Nickario> I liked the old mill short
<Fireant> Celestia should be the Emperor(ess)
<WindBlown> and Luna vader?
<Fireant> Yupyup
<disney> i like wall.e do u?
<WindBlown> meh...
<WindBlown> Luna is bad again
<UxieLover> 11Good idea!
<Lati> 12any pixar film is great
<Fireant> Vader wasn't bad
<Nightboomfer> Nightmare Vader
<Fireant> Watch the movie.
<Lati> 12'cept I wasn't a big fan of cars
<WindBlown> hahaha xD
<WindBlown> tbh
<WindBlown> I have only seen the first one, I'm not realy the one to talk about SW
<Nightboomfer> Maybe Fluttershy as Chewbacca and Applejack as Lando Calrissian
<Nickario> I liked cars! D: but it was the only pixar film that didn't win animation oscar as far as I know
<Fireant> And Lyra should be Jabba
<Nightboomfer> Pinkie Pie as Admiral Ackbar
<Fireant> As she is a chubby pony.
<Lati> 12it was okay, the sequel does look much better but I'm just basing that on its trailer
<Aurora> 6I actually am very dissappointed with what they're basing their sequel on
<Aurora> 6I actually liked cars
<Aurora> 6this second one...
<Aurora> 6just
<Aurora> 6no
<Lati> 12xD I'm not too bothered about it
<Lati> 12But I can't wait for Monsters inc 2 <3
<Nickario> I know roara kind of a odd direction they're taking it
<DJMidli> Nightboomfer wouldnt zecora work better as lando calrissian, given the race
<Aurora> 6I can't talk though
<UxieLover> 11The template's not quite finished yet, did you know?
<Nickario> spies and stuff? o-o still seeing Micheal Caine as a spy might be the closest I'll ever see him becoming James Bond
<Aurora> 6I didn't expect much for Kung Fu Panda 2, that's one of my favorite movies now
<Nightboomfer> I meant as far as character interactions go
<Nickario> Micheal Caine is win
<Nightboomfer> I think Zecora would make a good Yoda
<Fireant> Actualy I agree.
<NINJAPWNY> i think big mac as chewbacca
<Nightboomfer> lives in the woods, a weird way of speaking, in tune with nature
<disney> how about the inpossibls
<Fireant> Zecora - Yoda
<Chimera> 04Roara
<NINJAPWNY> trixie = boba fett
<Chimera> 04yes Cars 2 sucks :|
<Aurora> 6eh?
<Nightboomfer> that's perfect
<Aurora> 6wait is it out?
<Chimera> 04no
<Lati> 12owo
<Chimera> 04but the concept
<Chimera> 04is horrific
<Lati> 12xD
<Fireant> Indeed!
<Aurora> 6 10:56	Aurora	I can't talk though <-
<Aurora> 6I haven't seen it
<Aurora> 6I wont judge
<Aurora> 6but from what I know, i'm not thrilled
<Chimera> 04They're taking a racer and putting him in Japan
<Fireant> However.
<Chimera> 04yeah me neither
<Fireant> We lack one main role.

<NINJAPWNY> pwny...AWWWAAAY!!!
<Roleplay4life> 5I probably won't go see Cars 2. I wasn't impressed at /all/ with the first one and the second seems very "lolwut?" to me.
<Fireant> I am so, so tempted.
<Aurora> 6I loved the first one
<Fireant> But I will stop myself.
<Aurora> 6until my family nominated it as the official family movie
<Aurora> 6and we watched it over a hundred times in less than two months

<Roleplay4life> 5It was?
<Lucas> and caps
<Angel_Espeon> 13My mum was using the TV yesterday .w.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I saw it was on though
<Gordon_Freeman> Needs more cake.
<Lucas> so go to the RP room
<Angel_Espeon> 13We watched Karate Kid instead |D
<Lati> 12Yeah I saw a bit of it, I'm not sure which channel though
<Aurora> 6Karate Kid was an awesome movie
<Roleplay4life> 5The original was~
<Angel_Espeon> 13We watched the remake, not the original
<Revolver> Okay.
<Aurora> 6I never saw the original
<Aurora> 6I love the new one
<Roleplay4life> 5D8
<Roleplay4life> 5NEVER?
<Revolver> Wait, YOU got sidetracked?
<Aurora> 6never
<Lucas> SOeone took my laptop...
<Revolver> Ah-hah hah hah hah hah.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've never seen the original either LOL
<Roleplay4life> 5You mean you've never seen the famous "wax on, wax off" scene!?
<Angel_Espeon> 13but yeah the remake is <3
<Revolver> Who?
<Roleplay4life> 5xD;
<Lucas> little sis
<Roleplay4life> 5I wasn't too impressed with it.
<Roleplay4life> 5But I am this STICKLER for original versions bleh bleh bleh
<Lucas> Now I'm using the main comp
<Roleplay4life> 5Unless it's like a planned series or something.
<Roleplay4life> 5That's why I will try to avoid watching dubbed movies if I can.
<Flamerunner> Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar.
<Roleplay4life> 5It kind of reminds me of going to see a movie based on a book without reading the book first, y'know?
<Nero> Faaammmiiiineeee
<Roleplay4life> 5(Yet another thing I try to avoid.)
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't read books |D
<Lurkingear> so we talk bout ponypocalypse?
<Roleplay4life> 5D:
<Flamerunner> i would join the ponies.
<Flamerunner> :D
<Roleplay4life> 5I read obsessively. xD; It's the only reason my writing doesn't stink completely.
<Lurkingear> i mean what Nero said
<disney> i can't stop talking about TKL
<ZekeS> Nice one coz
<Coz> 10 seconds flat
<Lurkingear> cuz of his name? Coz?
<SillyNilly> RBD would be proud
<Ali1017> /)^3^(\ SO AWESOME
<Nero> "would"?! SHE IS ALIVE
<ZekeS> Coz: Actually, it was exactly 10 secons betwen his hjoining and the /mode +b
<Roleplay4life> 5Lol why?
<Roleplay4life> 5Because it's pretty much the greatest animated movie EVER?
<Nightboomfer> win
<Lati> 12tkl?
<Lurkingear> pwny
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh wait what
<Roleplay4life> 5I misread that as TLK
<Roleplay4life> 5xDDDDD
<Roleplay4life> 5OOOOPS
<Lati> 12LOL
<Roleplay4life> 5I dunno what TKL is
<Lati> 12Neither do I owo
<Roleplay4life> 5Well I do know that TKL is a company that can customize instrument cases. Pretty sweet stuff actually.
<Roleplay4life> 5But I assume that's not what disney is talking about. =P
<Nightboomfer> So I think the FiM box set is actually a warning about the apocalypse.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Narcoleptic dogs on TV
<Angel_Espeon> 13;w;
<Espeon> 06That's just sad :<
<DSD|Codemaster> 4Thanks
<Lati> 12maybe it was meant to be TLK
<Nightboomfer> The four ponies included are Pinkie, Twilight, Applejack, and Celestia (and spike)
<Roleplay4life> 5Maybe.
<disney> cuz i love TLK so much :)
<Ali1017> i for one, welcome our new pony overlords
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4Page mode
<Lati> 12xD
<Roleplay4life> 5OOOHHH SO YOU /DID/ MEAN TLK. xD
<Roleplay4life> 5Okay.
<Lucas> Ok
<Nightboomfer> I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. (Celestia)
<disney> the lion king
<Roleplay4life> 5It really was a groundbreakingly amazing film. <3
<Nero> So which pony would be which horseman?
<Lati> 12for some reason I enjoyed it's sequel equally with the first movie
<Roleplay4life> 5I still love it~
<Nightboomfer> Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword.
<TheFiveMarnaxes> *Later* <Ali> *Hurriedly tears down 'All hail Celestia poster*
<Roleplay4life> 5Nyeh. It was all right. /shrug
<Mongoose> I am going to go
<Angel_Espeon> 13I saw the sequel before the original o-o
<Nightboomfer> When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.
<Roleplay4life> 5Really? xD
<Lati> 12If I remember, I think thats one of the only disney movie sequels I liked
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah, I had a VHS tape of the sequel and didn't buy the original until much later xD
<Nero> Soooo, War = Rainbow Dash Conquest = Celestia
<Nightboomfer> And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
<Roleplay4life> 5For like a month when I was a toddler I watched TLK twice a day for a month or two, and then for about three more months I was watching it daily. xD Oh gawd I loved that so much.
<Roleplay4life> 5I'm surprised the VHS tape didn't wear out.
<Nightboomfer> Famine= Pinkie Pie
<Nero> 1 more...
<Nightboomfer> Pestilence= Fluttershy
<Angel_Espeon> 13When I was little I was obsessed with Tom and Jerry xD
<Lati> 12LOL I was like that with fox and the hound!
<Nero> Gothya
<Nightboomfer> because of parasprites
<Nero> Nice.
<Lurkingear> Nero, y u so bold!
<Lurkingear> ?
<Nero> Hmmm...
<Nero> Better?
<Flamerunner> Let's get down to bisness
<Flamerunner> to defeat
<Flamerunner> the huns
<Lati> 12and Anastasia <3
<Lurkingear> dare they sent me bronies
<SillyNilly> No, the carebears
<Nero> huns = ?
<Aurora> 6omg anastasia
<Aurora> 6yeah, not disney, but awesome movie nonetheless
<Lati> 12Agreed :3
<Lurkingear> when i asked for colts
<Flamerunner> Nero... you never heard of huns before?
<Nero> Sadly not.
<Flamerunner> what's your grade in history?
<Nero> -7
<Nickario> I thought the begginig of that movie was a bit dark o.o
<Flamerunner> ...
*Flamerunner facehoofs
<Nickario> what when all the soviet revolutionaries come for anatasia...
<Roleplay4life> 5I can't say I remember that movie.
<Roleplay4life> 5But I've seen so many it's nuts. D:
<Fiddler> do any of you wear horseshoes?
<Nero> Yep.
*Lurkingear facehoofes as well
<TheFiveMarnaxes> I just found Halo xover fics
<Aurora> 6yeah that movie is really dark, but still so good
<Nero> PLated with the souls of the fallen.
<Fiddler> facehoofs must hurt
<Roleplay4life> 5I saw /The Fighter/ last night too. SUCH AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE. Boxing, yeaaaaaaah~
<Lurkingear> they really do
<Nero> Yeah, thats why i don't do them.
<Roleplay4life> 5WELTERWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WOOORLD~
<Roleplay4life> 5<3
<Lurkingear> thats why i wear magnets as horseshoes
<Nero> ?
<Lurkingear> somehow they hurt less...
<Roleplay4life> 5Anyone else seen it? It won a few Oscars and was nominated for a bunch more.
<Aurora> 6I actually do want to see that one
<Fiddler> they use MAGIC
<Espeon> 06That movie was great o3o
<Espeon> 06So see it. Yeah.
<Roleplay4life> 5It was really good but it's not exactly for the faint of heart, I'd say.
<Nero> Binded with the souls of the fallen?
<Lurkingear> is there any mormon pony that can explain?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I haven't even heard of it
<Angel_Espeon> 13;;
<UxieLover> 11Same here!
<Nero> MORMONS MUST BURN IN THE FIRES OF HELL.
<Fiddler> mormons are ok people
<Coz> Lets not get onto the topic of religion, as it just starts flamewars
<Fiddler> terrible people at a bar though
<Coz> !muffins
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Roleplay4life> 5You should totally check it out.
<TheFiveMarnaxes> I just found a Halo/Office fic.
<Ali1017> !muffins
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Roleplay4life> 5It's got Christian Bale in it, and of course he's fantastic. Very different role for him, though. Looks like he lost a /lot/ of weight for the part.
<Lurkingear> muffins!!!!
<Angel_Espeon> 13...Who? |D
<Coz> Why hello derpybot
<Lurkingear> are they made of oatmeal?
<Aurora> 6^
<ZekeS> Uh oh, derpybot lives
<Coz> !seen derpybot
<DerpyBot> Look into my eyes.. 6_9
*DerpyBot puts her front hooves on Coz's shoulders.
<Roleplay4life> 5He was in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.
<Angel_Espeon> 13But boxing doesn't sound all that appealing to me, so I'll need to be convinced to watch that one xD
<disney> wh so i can't talk about lion king?
*Lurkingear this requires popcorn
<Angel_Espeon> 13Haven't seen any Batman movies either LOL
<Aurora> 6no one said you couldn't
<ZekeS> !mail Lurkingear Muffins!
<DerpyBot> Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
<Aurora> 6we're just talking about other things
<ZekeS> !help
<Lurkingear> yay?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Heck, I never even saw Titanic until last year
<Nickario> o.o
<Roleplay4life> 5Well it's not /entirely/ about boxing. A lot of it touches on other things, like family problems, drug abuse, etc.
<Coz> !seen zekes
<Coz> noooooooooo
<Coz> derpy why
<Ali1017> why must you leave
<johnsey> she'll be back
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh yeah, and Bale was also in 3:10 to Yuma and Terminator Salvation.
<Lurkingear> hey! these are english muffins!!!
<Roleplay4life> 5As well as The New World (as John Rolfe).
<Angel_Espeon> 13Never heard of any of them .w.
<Roleplay4life> 5Awww maaaan. D: Gotta get you to a Blockbuster Video!
<disney> nobody likes lion king
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah I'm very in-the-dark when it comes to movies LOL
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4tired
<Roleplay4life> 5Or at least scavenge Youtube, lol.
<SillyNilly> Fancy..
<Aurora> 6I think we just had a discussion about how most people adore lion king
<Ali1017> and so lurking was trolled by derpy
<Roleplay4life> 5You could probably find all of those movies in parts there.
<Aurora> 6but we're not gonna talk about it all day
<Roleplay4life> 5Inb4 ^
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6wKhdO7R0&feature=related Nightmare Moon's theme
<Roleplay4life> 5This is Chat, after all. One topic never lasts. xD
<Lurkingear> D:
<UxieLover> 11Yeah, it's getting late here in Australia
<Roleplay4life> 5Haha, Angel_Espeon, you remind me of my friend. I was chatting on MSN with her (we were planning a get-together) while watching The Dark Knight and I guess she's only been to the movie theatres like.. five or six times in her LIFE. I was like, "Whoa, no way! D:"
<Lurkingear> anypony up for some Civ5?
<Ray||Osu> 02brb, bath~
<Roleplay4life> 5And she /works/ at the Imax theatre inside the local zoo.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I haven't been to the cinema very much either |D
<Nero> NO
<Nero> PLEASE NO
<Aurora> 6Harry Potter
<Aurora> 6in two weeks
<Roleplay4life> 5YAY
<Aurora> 6 3
<PsychicKid> wtf
<PsychicKid> i'm missing 10 coins on cool, cool mountain
<Aurora> 6 4
<Roleplay4life> 5So far off. ;~;
<Aurora> 6lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13I think I've been to the cinema about 5-7 times in total
<Roleplay4life> 5I go to the movies at least two-three times a year.
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I've said this before, but i lost track of the HP series after the third one xD
<Roleplay4life> 5But I'm really picky and will research the heck out of a movie before seeing it in theatres since they're so expensive. x__x
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've seen some parts of the newer movies, but never seen any of them in full
<disney> and 20 people dislike lion king cuz its one of the old moves
<Roleplay4life> 5I read all the HP books, starting with the fourth (the previous three I discovered all around the same time) within days of their respective releases.
<SillyNilly> Have you checked the slide?
<Espeon> 06brb food~~
<PsychicKid> Got the slide
<PsychicKid> Made it all in one pass
<PsychicKid> Ok I found them lol
<Aurora> 6I'm there like 5 times a year
<SillyNilly> Secret area in slide?
<Aurora> 6but this year may hit 10
<Roleplay4life> 5I'm sure more than 20 people dislike TLK. ^^;
<PsychicKid> There are none in the secret area
<SillyNilly> Cool
<HyperMetalLugia> I started HP when it first came out :P
<PsychicKid> But now I can't find the 8th r
<PsychicKid> red coin
<Roleplay4life> 5Roara, really? Haha.
<PsychicKid> fml
<SillyNilly> Been a long time since I played SM64
<SillyNilly> Good times
<Ali1017> wow, SM64, thst's old
<SillyNilly> Oldy but a goody
<Roleplay4life> 5HML but I think I was eight or something by the time the third book came out.
<Aurora> 6I've already gone twice for X-Men, Twice (gonna be 3 probably) for Kung Fu Panda, once maybe twice for harry potter when it comes out
<Ali1017> 64 or the DS remake?
<PsychicKid> 64
<Roleplay4life> 5Actually I don't remember. Let me chuck.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<Roleplay4life> 5**check
<Aurora> 6I can't remember back past may though, what came out
<Roleplay4life> 5Hey Damos~
<PsychicKid> I'm trying to go for 120 stars + all coins in all 15 levels
<Damos> hey Rolly Polly
<PsychicKid> It sucks on some levels cuz some coins can fall off the stage
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4art for games is always good
*Damos huggles
<Ali1017> i achieved that
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4Thats my fav part
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4oh and music
<Roleplay4life> 5Let's see, I would've been 5 when the first HP book came out.. so...
<Damos> roll again
<PsychicKid> OH right
<PsychicKid> The ski lift thing
<Aurora> 6I got that book the day after it came out
<Aurora> 6I'm STILL into it
*Angel_Espeon 13has a ham, cheese and pickle sandwich o3o
<PsychicKid> 154 coins get
<Roleplay4life> 5Hm.. I probably started reading around 1999 or something. Maybe 2000 and then in time for the release of the fourth book, because I remember when my dad came home with it and I was like "OOO: MUST READ NOW".
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4Also it shows alot
<lightumbreon> xD
<lightumbreon> my perfect Sandvich combo:
<lightumbreon> Ham, Cheese, Pickles Mayonaise, Curry and onion
<Damos> lol
<B-Man> Just how many coins are there between the 15 levels (and the bonus stages, for that matter?)
<Aurora> 6when the 7th book finally came out
<Aurora> 6I was in my room
<Aurora> 6for 3 days
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4It seems that they did alot of armor
<Roleplay4life> 5I was in my room for two days.. 'cause that's how long it took me to finish. xD
<Ali1017> i don't keep a stable count of how many there are total
<Ali1017> just the one's you need 100 for
<Roleplay4life> 5I got it at midnight the day of release (release party at the library, yeaaah xD) and just basically slept as little as possible, ate as little as possible, and just READ.
<disney> Aurora whats yur fav chcarater in TLK?
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Aurora> 6I was crazy about that book
<Aurora> 6I LIVED BY FILTERING FOOD FROM THE AIR
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4more then we thought or they added
<Aurora> 6no in all seriousness though, it was awesome
<Roleplay4life> 5I think it's funny that there were big release parties at the local library for the last few HP books but not for any of the Twilight books. (; Says something about them..? /shot
<Aurora> 6um..
<Roleplay4life> 5Mmhm. Ditto there. (Inb4)
<Aurora> 6I actually am not that crazy about Lion King
<Aurora> 6I don't have a favorite character
<Damos> where
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4Looks like they might have had four ready
<Aurora> 6I've gotten sick with obsessions about it, so while it's a good movie, I'm meh about loving it to death
<Roleplay4life> 5I mean "ditto" on that phrase.
<Nightmare_Moon> Hello hello hello, how are all the fillies and colts today?
<Damos> oh
<Damos> sorry
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't have a fave TLK character. I LOVE THEM ALL. <3 But I like Scar. Freaking amazing.
<PsychicKid> 2000 something
<Roleplay4life> 5And the one Hyena voiced by WHOOPI GOLDBERG. 8DDD
<Aurora> 6I guess it would probably be the hyenna-
<Aurora> 6yeh
<PsychicKid> in all 15 levels it's 2092
<Roleplay4life> 5(But she's my hero.)
<Aurora> 6I loved that lol
<Aurora> 6I LOVE her voice
<Aurora> 6so much
<PsychicKid> plus bonus/extra stages and the few in the castle that don't count towards the total, 2672
<Roleplay4life> 5I watch The View every morning just for her. xD; /pathetic
<Roleplay4life> 5And I got into Star Trek: The Next Generation because of her recurring guest character.
<Damos> I think my fav in that movie is zazo
<Roleplay4life> 5She is truly awesome. |D
<User_9787> bleargh
<Damos> zazu*
<Roleplay4life> 5So lulzy. xD

<Silver_Heart> I'm here on a crusade to find inspiration to write AppleDash Fanfiction. >.>
<Roleplay4life> 5He even thought to collaborate with the Hyenas! Of course in the end /no one/ was happy but eh, system's a system.
<Silver_Heart> And to talk about ponies.
<Aurora> 6villains are popular
<Aurora> 6LIKE LORD SHEN
*Aurora 6barraged by bricks

<xDaFreakshowx> Ponies Ponies Ponies.
<Roleplay4life> 5GIOVANNI <--- Most epic villian ever in Pokeymanz xD
<Nightmare_Moon> Well today is father's day and I have a huge family so... when food rolls around you won't see me until later tonight.
<xDaFreakshowx> O SHHHHHI-
<Roleplay4life> 5HE'S NOT VILLAINOUS
<Roleplay4life> 5HE'S JUST GREEDY
<xDaFreakshowx> Hey fireant.
<xDaFreakshowx> sup?
<Roleplay4life> 5AND MISUNDERSTOOD
<Roleplay4life> 5o^o
<UxieLover> 11Yikes. I's 4:15am! Night, DSD!
<Revolver> Nightmare Moon's relatives besides Celly?
<disney> but he was mean to zazu and sarabi
<Revolver> Must see.
<Nightboomfer> Blueblood
<Aurora> 6well yeh
<xDaFreakshowx> Blueblood = son?
<Aurora> 6that's kinda what villains DO
<xDaFreakshowx> PARADOX! wooooooos
<Roleplay4life> 5That and his mom was too busy holding together the Japanese Mafia to take care of her son and then she was like "O HEY GIOVANNI MY DEAR SON HERE'S TEAM ROCKET KTHXBAI".
<Revolver> He's a duke.
<xDaFreakshowx> h*
<Revolver> Isn't he?
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4Night
<Roleplay4life> 5(Okay I'm done.)
<xDaFreakshowx> He is PRINCE blueblood.
<xDaFreakshowx> Celestia's Nephew
<Silver_Heart> He's a Royal Pain.
<xDaFreakshowx> which means that Luna...
<Silver_Heart> As Rarity put it.
<xDaFreakshowx> oh god...
<Silver_Heart> >.>;
<Nightmare_Moon> Blueblood's a sham, he has no royal blood
<disney> and the whole pride
<Nickario> isn't giovanni italian?
<UxieLover> 11See ya later!
<xDaFreakshowx> oh...ok
<xDaFreakshowx> :p
<Nickario> cos thats a italian name xD
<Roleplay4life> 5Lolol I have no idea.
<Silver_Heart> Lets ship Blueblood and Big Macintosh.
<Pjony> and Rarity says he is Celestia's Nephew, but according to Faust he is just some distant cousin
<Silver_Heart> >.>
<Roleplay4life> 5I have this idea that maybe one of his parents was Italian and the other Japanese, like maybe his dad was.
<Roleplay4life> 5(The latter.)
<xDaFreakshowx> distant cousin..ahhh
<Nightmare_Moon> I would say I'm speaking in terms of rl... but everypony knows rl is a myth, there's no such thing as humans
<Roleplay4life> 5But I dunno anything about Giovanni's father. Maybe his mother killed him. O__o;
<xDaFreakshowx> XP
<Silver_Heart> Humans? I'm just a pony stuck in a human suit.
<Roleplay4life> 5She's never given a name though, just "Madame Boss".
<Silver_Heart> The zipper broke off. e.e'
<Nightboomfer> I once saw a naked pink ape with its cutie mark printed on a tunic on its chest
<xDaFreakshowx> Becareful what you say...

<xDaFreakshowx> >>
<xDaFreakshowx> ...
<BronyMike> The Ultimate Orgy? Yeah, lots of people have said that, I never actually watched it.
<xDaFreakshowx> And THAT is the kind of quote Fox News wants.
<Roleplay4life> 5Never really appealed to me, I don't know. And like I said I don't know it very well.
<xDaFreakshowx> ~_~
<Aurora> 6I like Ben 10
<xDaFreakshowx> oh hold on...can this IRC handle symbols?
<disney> its funny when gwen tell ben a duffies
<Aurora> 6I'm amazed we're discussinf this lol
<Silver_Heart> O.o
<Aurora> 6but only the first episodes
<Nightboomfer> Hey Fox news I have a pony waifu and I brush her hair every day also I hate the military and I hate America and Freedom
<Silver_Heart> It can handle ponies.
<Silver_Heart> So maybe?
<xDaFreakshowx> To the character map!
<Aurora> 6after a while, it got stupid
<Roleplay4life> 5Hmm. Like so many things... xD;
<BronyMike> Man, I sure do love going down to the park with my ponies, picking up little girls, tying them up in my van, and forcing them to sing the show's songs with me.
<Nightboomfer> Also I am on disability and I'm an immigrant
<Kosoveon> hi Nick :)
<BronyMike> And I'm an antipatriotic Atheist.
<Espeon> 06Nom
<lightumbreon> erm disney, i'm having a hard tim understanding what you'r saying, and i believe i'm not the only one, could you please mind it? i think it's not even allowed to speak like that (check the MODT or site rules)
<xDaFreakshowx> that is homosexual?
<xDaFreakshowx> and burns bibles
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't really watch much TV besides broadcast dramas and a few cable dramas. I haven't seen an animated series in yeeeeears.
<ahaugen> I vote democrat!
<Silver_Heart> >.>
<BronyMike> And born out of a mixed-race family
<Silver_Heart> I vote for Applejack + Rainbow Dash fanfiction.
<BronyMike> Appledash is probably the best ship.
<disney> i lik the origino
<BronyMike> Though something I'm surprised I haven't seen yet:
<Nightboomfer> Oh... I have informed opinions of my own, and vote according to policy!
<BronyMike> Spikejack
<Silver_Heart> I like Trixie+Twilight.
<Roleplay4life> 5Like I'll watch Fringe, everything on USA Network, I'll be watching Falling Skies on TNT tonight, Leverage on.. ah.. what is it, TNT?, Modern Family, The Middle, etc..
<Nightboomfer> Fluttershy x Everyone just because it's adorable
<BronyMike> Thing is, Spike+Applejack actually seems like it could happen.
<Aurora> 6TV shows?
<Silver_Heart> Spike's too... Spike.
<Roleplay4life> 5^ Yes.
<Silver_Heart> >.>
<Aurora> 6I'm a CSI/Criminal Minds/NCIS junkie
<Silver_Heart> Plus the show shipped him with Rarity.
<Silver_Heart> xD
<lightumbreon> O.o
<Nightboomfer> Spike/Apple Bloom?
<lightumbreon> NCIS is awesome
<Silver_Heart> ...
<Roleplay4life> 5I like NCIS but I don't watch any of those regularly. xP
<Aurora> 6yep
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here :P
<BronyMike> Yes, but it's clear Rarity isn't into him, I'm thinking he'd work with AJ. See,
<lightumbreon> i watch it everythime
<Roleplay4life> 5All my favourites from this year got canceled. :C
<Aurora> 6I found the first two seasons at target for 15 bucks each
<Aurora> 6had to buy
<lightumbreon> my mom always slaps me like gibbs does by Dinozzo
<lightumbreon> xD
<Nightboomfer> Found this thread on Ponychan http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35823453.html
<Aurora> 6lol
<Roleplay4life> 5V. The Event. No Ordinary Family. The Cape. ALL. CANCELED. ;^;
<Aurora> 6my family tends to slap each other around like that too
<Silver_Heart> Rarity isn't into anyone except herself, but given her experience with AJ in Season 1, it's possible to ship AJ and Rarity together... granted, they're like Yin and Yang.
<Aurora> 6oh
<Roleplay4life> 5LOL. xD
<Aurora> 6and i have an accurate counter for HP7
<BronyMike> At the end of Ticket Masters, Spike runs out with his ticket all giddy and whatnot, then acts cool in front of Applejack, who just kinda brushes it off. Then there's the whole "ho-ho, there, lover boy" bit in Diamond Dogs
<xDaFreakshowx> щ(°д°)щ
<Nightboomfer> "Shut up and kiss me, you idiot!"
<xDaFreakshowx> YES!
<xDaFreakshowx> muhahaha!
<Aurora> 6cuz thats the same day a contest entry is due
<xDaFreakshowx> it works!
<Aurora> 6 3 weeks, 5 days
<Aurora> 6:D
*Aurora 6runs
<Roleplay4life> 5I think literally every broadcast Scifi got canceled except for Fringe. All of them.
<Aurora> 6best breakfast ever: bowl of reeses ice cream
<disney> and i lik upgrade he's alosome
<Roleplay4life> 5But I've been recently getting into MTV's (yes, MTV) Teen Wolf. It is a really, /really/ good show. You wouldn't believe it on MTV but it IS. Fantastic Dramedy/Action/Scifi.
<BronyMike> So wait, how the hell do I register a name on this thing?
<Roleplay4life> 5AND IT'S PRODUCED BY THE GUY WHO DID CASTLE. Well, co-produced.
<Aurora> 6we were watching teen wolf in the break room at work
<Aurora> 6I only saw the first 5 minutes of the opening pilot
<Silver_Heart> I'm a proud bronie... infact, this is my ringtone. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GFpFNBqj2M
<Aurora> 6so still dunno much aout it
<Silver_Heart> X3
<Roleplay4life> 5(As well as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine but uumm... xD; Yay Rene Echevarria.)
<Roleplay4life> 5Roara, I think it's worth checking out.
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6WHAT at that last name
<xDaFreakshowx> :P
<Roleplay4life> 5Echevarria?
<Aurora> 6my best friend at work, that's his last name
<Roleplay4life> 5Really?
<xDaFreakshowx> ∞
<Roleplay4life> 5How 'bout that!
<Nightboomfer> I'm OK with shipping. The girls seems roughly college-age, and even if they're not into other fillies, College could lead to more experimentation
<Aurora> 6I was JUST talking to him about how i've never ever ever heard that name before
<Aurora> 6like, yesterday
<Aurora> 6cuz here in my town, we have mainly common names
<Nightboomfer> :/ IJMO
<Aurora> 6WEIRD
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah, I pretty much idolize R.E. He's a really good writer and has done some epic screenplays.
<Silver_Heart> IJMO?
<Silver_Heart> o.o
<Nightboomfer> just my opinion
<gingerale> Oh yeah
<gingerale> Genderspecific names! Brony = male, Bronie = female. :B
<Nightboomfer> I usually use filly and colt
<BronyMike> filly-brony/colt-brony?
<xDaFreakshowx> ∂x/∂t t²+x³ = ???
<xDaFreakshowx> you have ten seconds.
<Nightboomfer> aeiou
<Silver_Light> Refresh button ate the chat.
<BronyMike> and then brony itself is gender-neutral otherwise?
*Aurora 6chucks a spoonful of ice cream at RP's FACE
<Silver_Light> So wait, there's a term for a girl fan?
<BronyMike> Nope.
<Roleplay4life> 5o-o
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> http://goo.gl/Y4Jtr
<BronyMike> Likewise, there's no term for a boy fan.
<gingerale> Yeah, usually brony is gender neutral
<Roleplay4life> 5Lolwut?
<Aurora> 6dunno
<Aurora> 6I'm eating some
<gingerale> For males and females of all age
<Aurora> 6felt like FLINGING
<Roleplay4life> 5I want sooome. D:
<BronyMike> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo
<Roleplay4life> 5 /scrapes off of face
<Silver_Light> I want a few t-shirts, mostly with just Rainbow Dash's and Applejack's cutie marks.
<BronyMike> just 'cause y'know I like whoring out my vids
<Silver_Light> Or with the character on them.
<Silver_Light> But no desire to collect the toys or anything.
<Roleplay4life> 5Why would you fling ice cream anyways? It's so priceless and delicious IT MUSTN'T GO TO WASTE.
<BronyMike> I think Dash's mark is the most recognizable symbol of bronydom.
<Silver_Light> I'd buy a DvD set of Season 1. X3
<Fireant> Why three times?
<Nightboomfer> I got some of the Brushable ponies the other day
<Silver_Light> Even if I have access to it on Youtube.
<Silver_Light> >.>
<Fireant> One set is enough.
<Aurora> 6I have a ton all to myself
<Aurora> 6I DO WHAT I WANT
<Silver_Light> X3 is a face.
<BronyMike> SO BRONIES I FORGOT PINKIE PIE WAS IN MY POCKET ALL DAY
<Roleplay4life> 5Oohhh. xD
<Nightboomfer> to share with your friends
<BronyMike> HER MANE'S A FUCKING MESS
<Fireant> No, its not. Its an EX with a number three.
<xDaFreakshowx> wait...
<Nightboomfer> isn't it usually?
<Roleplay4life> 5I have to force myself not to eat more than I truly want/need.
<Silver_Light> Do they have an Applejack toy?
<BronyMike> God she looks like she's been in a war zone
<xDaFreakshowx> her mane is always a mess
<xDaFreakshowx> ...
<Silver_Light> Like, by herself?
<Silver_Light> >.>
<Nightboomfer> yeah
<Nightboomfer> no hat though
<Nightboomfer> unless you get deluxe applejack
<Roleplay4life> 5So I get a small little cup and put ONE SCOOP in and then store it in the back of the freezer, hidden away so it's a challenge to get more.
<Nightboomfer> or the barn playset
<Silver_Light> I'd get one of Dash and Jack, but only cause they're my favorites. :P
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13YES IT'S FIXED
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13I'll be back in a few minutes
<Roleplay4life> 5O:

<Silver_Heart> Caps?
<Silver_Heart> O.o
<xDaFreakshowx> No excessive caps
<johnsey> caps are alright if you use them sparingly and where it matters
<xDaFreakshowx> Like when i did the Y U NO because that's how you do it properly ;)
<xDaFreakshowx> Chicken tastes like....chicken...How boring.

<Angel_Espeon> 13Ahaha, I went to my bluetooth folder to find the photos I just took and found myself laughing at a picture of my friend pulling a derp face that I forgot was in there
<MPR> exponential doesn't mean literally exponential in all cases.
*Angel_Espeon is easily amused

<Revolver> Hey, he was complaning, not me.
*Muffin_Overlord_Derpy feels violated because of caps lock
<Silver_Heart> Pinkie Pie drives Gods to drink themselves drunk.

<xDaFreakshowx> Dr. Whooves becomes canon.
<Silver_Heart> Ponies.... in tiiiiiiiimmmmmeee!
<Revolver> Can you make me explode with awesome twice?
*Aeroslash understands that feeling to both of those comments
<Snowball> Nope
<Snowball> 3 time!
<xDaFreakshowx> Yerp
<xDaFreakshowx> 4 time
<Silver_Heart> I predict more breaking of the 4th wall in Season 2.
<Roleplay4life> 5But it's been /years/ (at least a couple) since I made it to the top 10. ;w;
<Revolver> Next thing we know, Memories of Days Long Past will happen.
<Nightboomfer> Rainbow dash has a coming out story, Rarity moves to canterlot, Applejack has a coming out story, and Spike Becomes a Dragon with a beefy arm
<Revolver> With all this time.
<Aeroslash> ahh
<Lucas> Wth
<Lucas> sftre
<Revolver> :l
*Aeroslash never has
<Lucas> are you guys doing?
<Roleplay4life> 5But I don't have that many posts in the forums because most of them are in the RP board, which doesn't count. :C
<Revolver> RD can't be gay. It's against children's show rules.
<Lati> 12This is going to sound really stalkerish
<Lord-Blazer> Besides, that's fanon assumption
<Roleplay4life> 5So um yeah. But I should probably post in the forums more because I have been a member since freaking FEBRUARY 2007.
<Nightboomfer> I'm just paraspriting
<ninjapwny> i think shipping in general is against kids show rules
<Revolver> Hello, Logic.
<Aeroslash> I don't have many posts either
<Snowball> What?
<DJMidli> no, there are definately relationships in kids shows.
<xDaFreakshowx> Nope.
<Revolver> Come to give us all a harsh lesson?
<Aeroslash> not even 200 and I've been a member since Dec. 2008
<xDaFreakshowx> :o
<Lati> 12But for some reason I remember a few names from .co.uk (I was mainly a lurker back then) and I'm sure you were one of the names I remember
<DJMidli> cripes man, the hub summer promo has two cartoon charas KISSING
<Roleplay4life> 5My username over at .co.uk was Unipaluverno2.
<Roleplay4life> 5(Don't ask.)
<Lati> 12ah maybe not you then
<ninjapwny> OSNAP
<DJMidli> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjBViIt-y8
<ninjapwny> hide ur wife
<Roleplay4life> 5I ONLY posted in the Roleplay boards. xD
<ninjapwny> hide ur kids
<Lati> 12something like that
<Lati> 12haha XD
<DJMidli> so no, shipping is NOT banned in childrens shows
<Lord-Blazer> hide yo logic
<Imagination> :3
<Revolver> Yeap.
<Nightboomfer> just Gay shipping
<Aeroslash> I love how RP boards don't count but forum games do XD
<Lati> 12I knew about this website ever since I got the internet, I just didn't join for a long time and got more active lately XD
<Snowball> No ogic for you
<Nightboomfer> which is really hypocritical
<Revolver> But MLP has the 'Edumucation' tag.
<ScriptBot> New Peak for #silverwings is set on
<Roleplay4life> 5That's where I met Dallin (Pikachu_Gunner or some variation of that) and Icester, I think that was his username there too. And LiveToPlay2005 (I think that was Tanner's username on the old site).
<Ghosties> 4MY CONNECTION TIMED OUT, WAT DO
<Lucas> Lol, I ust noticed that Logic exited and Imagination entered XD
<Lati> 12Livetoplay is a familiar name
<Lord-Blazer> DJMidli: My main problem with shipping is just when it's done with fanon assumption using stereotypes about tomboys :/
<Revolver> lololololol.
<Snowball> It gives people morals about kindness oh who am I kidding? PONIES!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Roleplay4life> 5Ugh, Aeroslash, I wish the RP boards /did/ count (as opposed to the Forum Games) but eh, I'm sure there are reasons.
<Imagination> What?
<Ghosties> 4Oh, haha, I thought people were active in the thread. Well, I feel like a klutz. Oh well, goodbye everybody
<Revolver> You focus on Fluttershy too much.
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah, Tanner, Dallin, and Icester all quit around the same time. For a while we all were on our own forum but we had issues getting new members (i.e. getting them to stick around) so it died a year or so back.
<DJMidli> Lord-Blazer tbh at least the fan-fiction writers break down gender barriers.
<Snowball> No...
<Imagination> Everything is possible with IMAGINATION
<Revolver> You just said Kindness.
<xDaFreakshowx> :o
<Lati> 12Thats a shame
<Revolver> That's Fluttershy's thing.
<xDaFreakshowx> Imaginaaaatttion
<Roleplay4life> 5We still keep in touch on DeviantART though. Tanner has met Icester, and last year Tanner and Dallin went to Japan together.
<Revolver> Leave some for the rest of us.
<Lucas> Not logic, how so ever, XP
<Lord-Blazer> I'll give you that, DJ, but it just bothers me when they use stereotypes and magically label RD as being a lesbian
<Roleplay4life> 5(...Or was it two years ago..? I dunno.)
<Snowball> So If I said honesty you think I foucus on Apple Jack?
<Imagination> I'm not a dust rag :<
<Revolver> Same here.
<xDaFreakshowx> well we can agree on one thing
<Lati> 12Either way at least you guys are still in contact ^^
<xDaFreakshowx> Gilda is lesbo
<DJMidli> Now the question is, do you have an issue with RBD being a lesbian if done in a gender-neutral manner?
<Roleplay4life> 5Mmhm.
<Revolver> That would be odd, Snowball, but probably.
<Lati> 12brb, checking on bath
<xDaFreakshowx> I have no issue.
<Lord-Blazer> I wouldn't have an issue
<Roleplay4life> 5Sure~
*Roleplay4life 5waits around.
<Retsamoreh> Issue with what?
<Snowball> Problom?
<Lord-Blazer> But it's the community itself that's labeling her as a lesbian, using very retarded reasoning
<Revolver> DJ, probably. It's annoying that she's percieved as a Lessie in general.
<Revolver> And some people that watch this show aren't gay.
<Revolver> SOME people.
<xDaFreakshowx> SOme...
<Revolver> *Such as myslef*
<Nightboomfer> I don't see her as that, much more than I percieve other ponies. Though I wonder what's wrong with her being a lesbian?
<Revolver> *Myself*
<Fireant> Okay.
<Fireant> Read the topic guys.
<Lord-Blazer> There is nothing wrong
<Lati> 12Okay it's fine, back ^_^
<Imagination> Hey, Not even I would like everyone. some.. *whimspers*
<Lord-Blazer> Just saying that the reasoning used is bad
<DJ-Midli> Fireant too far off PG?
<Fireant> DO you see the PG mark in it?
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh hey, cool.'
<ninjapwny> hey theyre being very professional about it
<xDaFreakshowx> We are treading on thin ice gentlement
<Roleplay4life> 5I actually have a PM to reply to on the forums, soooooo BRB. xD;
<xDaFreakshowx> men*
<Lord-Blazer> I do, Fireant and this has been a very civil discussion about the show
<Revolver> I thought the PG mark was just to prevent clopping.
<xDaFreakshowx> change of topic is in order
<Snowball> Mentlegen?
<Lord-Blazer> No insults has been thrown around
<DJ-Midli> right i forget, this uses the american definition of PG not the rest of the world.
<Fireant> It's not so far off, but please, contain it within the borders.
<Revolver> GentleMentleMen.
<DJ-Midli> Fireant I will ^^
<Lati> 12Okay dokey :3
<Revolver> Okay.
<Revolver> I'll try.
<Snowball> Mrph Mmmmmmmmmmrph!
<DJ-Midli> also anything said after my last post I missed.
<ninjapwny> yea how about using the japanese version of PG?
<DJ-Midli> the one where i said we are in agreement
<Nightboomfer> Why isn't that PG if straight couples can discuss.... whatever. Topic changing
<xDaFreakshowx> Gentlemen? *packs mouth full of cigarettes*
<DJ-Midli> No Id say using the "Euro-Canadian" definition
<Revolver> Japanese would allow clopping, would it not?
<ninjapwny> heck
<Chimera> 04I just had 8 eggs
<Chimera> 04|D
<ninjapwny> there'd be a lot more
<xDaFreakshowx> Them japanese.
<xDaFreakshowx> :I
<xDaFreakshowx> so crazy
<Revolver> :l
<Snowball> All I can tell you about zis next procedure is it's EXCRUSIATING!
<ninjapwny> did u see the story that they came up with poo steaks?
<Revolver> lolwut
<xDaFreakshowx> wait what/
<xDaFreakshowx> ?
<Revolver> Yeah, what?
<xDaFreakshowx> and some of revolvers response as well
<Revolver> I dun get it.
<ninjapwny> http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/06/17/japanese-scientists-create-meat-from-poop/
<xDaFreakshowx> what?
<Revolver> Oh.
<ninjapwny> seriously japan
<xDaFreakshowx> the
<DJMidli> what.
<Revolver> I see.
<ninjapwny> WTF
<xDaFreakshowx> fuck?
<DJMidli> DAMNIT JAPAN
<Snowball> I don't want to go to Japan now
<Revolver> I haven't wanted to go to Japan since January.
<ninjapwny> and the worst part?
<ninjapwny> they had a test panel TASTE TEST THEM!
<Snowball> It tastse lick cotton candy?
<Nightboomfer> What I wonder is if Bronies are supposed to be about love and tolerance, why is discussing gender and sexuality in a rational mature manner not considered PG? Am I overreacting here, or is there a stigma about exposing children to the fact that gay people exist?
<Revolver> :o
<ninjapwny> oh we're waaaaay past that
<ninjapwny> current topic: japanese poo steaks
<Nightboomfer> now we're talking about eating poo
<Revolver> This is America.
<Common_Sense> To late o save this chat room now....
<Revolver> We can't allow that for some reason.
<ninjapwny> but seriously
<DJMidli> Nightboomfer it's Fireant being sensitive and using the American definition of PG instead of the Euro-Canadian defination
<ninjapwny> poo steaks
<xDaFreakshowx> I
<xDaFreakshowx> Just
<xDaFreakshowx> threw
<xDaFreakshowx> up
<xDaFreakshowx> in
<xDaFreakshowx> my mouth.
<DJMidli> Nightboomfer rules are rules and we have to follow them regardless.
<Revolver> And I hate Lesbians not because they're gay, but because they take all the hot chicks for themselves.
<Fireant> Nightboomfer, overreacting you are, but on other things - I didn't told you to stop the discussion, but reminded gently to keep it withing the borders. Just to be on a safe side here.
<ninjapwny> omg
<ninjapwny> its a full scale flame war
<Revolver> JK, I don't hate them.
<ninjapwny> man ur battlestations people

<Snowball> "Die Welt ist voller Überraschungen und Möglichkeiten. So gehen Sie feststellen, Chancen und nehmen die Überraschungen Kopf auf!" -Alex Sapp 1996- I feel like Hitler now...
<DerpyBot> *derp*
<Revolver> Lolwut
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Lucas> Whose pony do you like?
<Revolver> You were talking the same year you were born?
<Revolver> Lucas, this implies Slavery.
<Revolver> Again.
<Snowball> I feel like Hitler because I'm motovating.....in German....
<Lucas> Salvery?
<Aeroslash> hi Quan
<Lucas> How so?
<Lucas> preferences aren't by force.
<Lucas> nor action
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Aero.
<Revolver> WHOSE pony do you like?
<BlankFlankBrony> Try using "which" instead of "whose"
<Lucas> words are words.
<Revolver> You asked WHOSE.
<Lucas> Sorry, wrong word then.
<Revolver> Is possesive noun.
<Snowball> Ilike Lauren Faust's ponies
<Revolver> RD is my favourite.
<Revolver> Obviously?
<Snowball> Fluttershy
<Revolver> *shrugs*
<Revolver> CogWeaver's favourite is Applejack.
<BlankFlankBrony> Hard to choose... I say Scootaloo, by a wingtip.
<Retsamoreh> Pinkie Pie.
<Revolver> Out of the Mane cast?
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<BlankFlankBrony> Too close to pick.
<Quanyails> 7Is it possible to do multi battles over wi-fi in Pokemon?
<Snowball> Least favorite? Rarity
<Revolver> Who?
<Aeroslash> umm, no
<Aeroslash> not that I know of
<Revolver> I mean, give me both.
<Revolver> Rarity is awesome.
<Flutterbro> Fluttershy, obviously.
<Revolver> Still at the bottom of my list.
<Revolver> But awesome.
<Snowball> I dislik her because she is a fashonist and a Drama Queen
<Revolver> Actually, she's at the bottom competing with Fluttershy for fifth place.
<Revolver> RD is in first, obviously, but Applejack is trailing not too far behind in Second.
<Revolver> Then it's Twilight, followed by Pinkie Pie.
<Revolver> Then, as I said, Fluttershy and Rarity competing for Last.
<Snowball> Einhorn is German for Unicorn
<Revolver> We realise this.

<HeinousActsZX> does anypony think that the negative attention recieved from the press will continue?
<Tenaris> http://kyojiogami.deviantart.com/art/Rainbowsnails-189105162?q=boost%3Apopular%20Mlp%20fim%20snails&qo=6
<ZekeS> HeinousActsZX: what do YOU think
<xDaFreakshowx> !help 3
<xDaFreakshowx> :P
<twentypercentcooler> meh, the press will always be negative
<CogWeaver> Most likely, HeinousActsZX
<Nightboomfer> Yes, but it'll die down just as quickly if we don't give them the reaction they want
<twentypercentcooler> cause almost all media is negative or tries to find the negative for the most part
<Silver_Heart> What about murderers?
<Silver_Heart> People who actually, y'know, hurt people?
<Silver_Heart> Go put some press on them. e.e'
<HeinousActsZX> I think it's gonna get worse before it gets better...
<Nightboomfer> they want to view us as immature manchildren. If we don't respond, they will stop because there's no more news stories
<NightSeas> 12Wb
<Silver_Heart> That's not the way it works Night.
<drfsupercenter> 03just got back from a NASCAR race
<Silver_Heart> You respond, then it must be true, if you don't respond, it's just further proof that there's something to hide, so it must be true.
<drfsupercenter> 03also, Angel_Espeon
<drfsupercenter> 03Comment posted.
<drfsupercenter> 03Hello, Trainer!
<drfsupercenter> 03We have successfully verified that your account qualifies for the Eevee Evolution promotion! We will contact you in the next few days with instructions on when and how to receive your Eevee Evolution on the Pokémon Global Link.
<drfsupercenter> 03Thank you again for your patience in regards to this issue. We appreciate it!
<drfsupercenter> 03Sincerely,

<CogWeaver> test !help
<CogWeaver> !help
<CogWeaver> okay, good
<CogWeaver> nevermind then
<johnsey> CogWeaver: ?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I got that too
<Angel_Espeon> 13It made my day :P
<HeinousActsZX> I just don't want to end up like the furries: Normal people who are constantly ridiculed.
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<Nightboomfer> Remember when Gamers were under attack by the press?
<CogWeaver> Just makin' sure one couldn't make DerpyBot endlessly send messages to herself
<twentypercentcooler> gamers are still attacked by the press I think?
<Nick> wait did you guys STILL not get your eevelution from DW? o0
<Nightboomfer> Gamers took that attention and starting giving back to the community, making sure that everyone knew that they were gamers.
<Nick> I got mine the second day!
<drfsupercenter> 03Nick, the thine broke
<CogWeaver> But I can see that she's loop-proof
<johnsey> ah yeah i tried to prevent that, although it does react to unkown ! commands.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nah, stupid error thought we weren't qualified
<Nick> the thine?
<drfsupercenter> 03*thing
<CogWeaver> oh really?
<CogWeaver> !as;fd
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah same
<Nick> right so a programming error?
<CogWeaver> ah, well it only goes *derp* 6_9
<HeinousActsZX> I'm just afraid is all
<johnsey> yeah
<CogWeaver> I don't think that's a problem
<drfsupercenter> 03Like I said, the thing broke./
<Nightboomfer> yes, but no one seriously believes that gamers are bad anymore. Maybe those who are so set in their ways they can;t accept them, but the public at large is now more open
<HeinousActsZX> but i might be overreacting
<RainbowCrash> hey everybody
<Nightboomfer> hi rc
<sketch> howdy
<RainbowCrash> everypony*
<RainbowCrash> lmao check out some of my new art http://physicallypossible.deviantart.com/#/d3jcshq
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Anypony else find themselves addicted to that Pony Touhou?
<RainbowCrash> yes LQ!
<Unidentified1052> say
<Unidentified1052> appe
<Unidentified1052> apple
<Lightning_Quickhoof> At least I know I'm not alone.
<johnsey> oh, typo in the welcome message
<sketch> pony Touhou?
<RainbowCrash> yesh
<johnsey> i guess no body ever reads it lol
<twentypercentcooler> HAHA RC, EPIC
<HeinousActsZX> On a different note, anyone going to the Connecticon?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> That MLP vs. Starcraft 2 Bullethell
<RainbowCrash> ty!
<B-Man> So as I posted on the FB bronies page: ProFB open bronies.
<HeinousActsZX> I want to organize a brony thing, but I don't know anyone else.
<RainbowCrash> most epic on MLPvSC2 Rainbow Dash
<B-Man> It's like having an infinite supply of man cards.
<B-Man> :P
<Nightboomfer> Maybe we can do a worldwide brony thing, or we can all release videos about the community. Make our arguments sane and rational
<twentypercentcooler> hmm
<HeinousActsZX> Will people listen?
<sketch> I doubt that they will
<sketch> nobody respects most any subculture even still
<HeinousActsZX> Yeah...
<Nightboomfer> If enough of us do it, it's like anonymous
<sketch> except possibly gamers
<Nightboomfer> they may not respect us, but they'd listen
<twentypercentcooler> if we all release videos and whatnot, it would be another one of those things the public will see as "those crazy people trying to make themselves seem normal"
<twentypercentcooler> just saying
<disney> haha
<twentypercentcooler> its how the public sees those kind of things
<disney> :D
<RainbowCrash> thats trie
<RainbowCrash> true*
<disney> :P
<Nick> hi disney
<sketch> of course, I guess anime has largely become more acceptable as well.. so possibly *shrugs*
<twentypercentcooler> hm
<Nightboomfer> All right, sorry. I'm just trying to throw ideas out and see what sticks
<HeinousActsZX> If people would just watch it, even if they didn't like it, they'd realize why WE like it.
<Lati> 12It said I had to wait until early july or something
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Now then. Back to Pony Touhou.
<HeinousActsZX> But that's too much to ask...
<RainbowCrash> im gunna DL rite now
<disney> haha lati:D
<sketch> Maybe, I've had some friends watch it. One says he can't stand it - but he does have odd tastes in things. Others get bored
*CogWeaver is bored*
<sketch> but in general, I suppose most don't hate it, or really see any reason to hate on it (much)
<Nightboomfer> One of my friends just hates cute, girly things in general, but he says he can see its appeal
<Nightboomfer> I showed him flutterrage
<sketch> heh, nice
<Silver_Heart_> That's better.
<sketch> I think the first few episodes are some of the best to show really. Show started off kinda epic
<Nightboomfer> Yeah, I would probably not have been hooked if I hadn't watched episodes 1 and 2
<HeinousActsZX> Really? I prefer the "Slice of Life" episodes.
<ST_Falcon> The CMC episodes have something going for them in that they actually portray the characters as KIDS.
<RainbowCrash> *opens Pony TouHou ZIP*
<Nightboomfer> Yeah, I love how realistic the character interactions are
<sketch> I think sonic rainboom was the first episode I saw. Liked it well enough to try out more
<ST_Falcon> Rather than miniature but somehow wiser adults.
<disney> Lati i said hi
<ST_Falcon> It actually admits that yes, kids are dumb.
<sketch> I could see that Falcon
<Lati> 12Hi? I swear that says "haha" XD
<Fiddler> i saw the first episode first
<Lati> 12but hello anyways :3
<ST_Falcon> I haven't actually SEEN that in a show before, as far as I can remember.
<HeinousActsZX> I started with Bridle gossip. When the ponies reacted to Pinkie's singing like normal characters would, I knew I would love it.
<Fiddler> didnt like it but i stuck through
<sketch> how old are the mane cast supposed to be anyway? I remember reading somewhere that rarity might be as old as 20 or so in human terms
<Nightboomfer> I think they're roughly college age
<Unidentified1052> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_lL9F4wiOQ&feature=feedlik
<RainbowCrash> google time
<sketch> Dog and Pony show almost killed me (I think it was the 3rd episode I saw)
<BlankFlankBrony> Sounds about right, Night.
<Tenaris> http://pinkiepie.bronibooru.mlponies.com/data/834e74f493a8dc19e5217d3ed4f288ba.jpg
<sketch> but Rarity does eventually grow on you
<sketch> or me anyway *shrug*
<Nightboomfer> Twilight is doing independent study, Rairty, Applejack and Pinkie all have jobs
<HyperMetalLugia> Sky~
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<Fiddler> the mane cast are 40 years old
<RainbowCrash> lwlz
<Fiddler> they need to be taught FRIENDSHIP
<RainbowCrash> seriously? 40?
<Silver_Heart> No.
<Silver_Heart> e.e'
<CogWeaver> Fid, that's converted to human years, which is nothing to go on in this show
<RainbowCrash> oh lmfao xD
<CogWeaver> Faust said that they were within the range of 18-22
<Nightboomfer> I know plenty of humans in their 20s who need to be taught friendship
<sketch> ah, cool Cog, seems about right
<CogWeaver> I think she said that Twi was specifically 18 or so...
<HeinousActsZX> So... uh, favorite pony songs? mine's Winter Wrap up
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=7123.msg270194#msg270194
<CogWeaver> At the Gala
<RainbowCrash> mine too
<Nightboomfer> WWU and at the Gala
<drfsupercenter> 03I seriously want to hurt someon e
<RainbowCrash> 8-bit version ftw
<drfsupercenter> 03for assuming that news article came from FOX News
<drfsupercenter> 03because it didn't
<Nightboomfer> and giggle at the ghosties
<sketch> Winter wrap up is pretty cool. Haven't listened to a lot of remixes though
<Fiddler> they are 40.. we must accept the fact that they female man children who know nothing of social interaction!
<sketch> thought Equestria girls was pretty funny
<RainbowCrash> l fiddler
<Nightboomfer> also Flutterguy's version of Evil Enchantress
<RainbowCrash> lol*
<drfsupercenter> 03people are all "OMFG YOU IDIOT YOU WATCH FOX NEWS?" and I'm like, no, I watch a station called WJBK
<CogWeaver> Fid...wtc?
<Fiddler> i know things
<sketch> lol
<CogWeaver> Faust said it herself, they were within the 18-22 range
<HeinousActsZX> Equestria Girls was awesome 'cause of the shout-outs. Had me in tears.
<xDaFreakshowx> :o
<Fiddler> thats even worse
<sketch> it was actually pretty well sung too, honestly (Equestria Girls)
<xDaFreakshowx> What's worse?
<xDaFreakshowx> My face? Indeed.
<CogWeaver> aww
<xDaFreakshowx> <|:B derp. Selfburn'd.
<CogWeaver> :(
<Fiddler> they are 40 year olds who ACT LIKE 18-20 year olds!
<RainbowCrash> ...i liked equestria girls
<CogWeaver> *facepalm*
<HyperMetalLugia> GOOD JOB DRF >:(
<RainbowCrash> lmao
<Nightboomfer> Things MLP has redeemed for me: The words "Twilight Sparkle", california gurls, and the my little pony franchise in general
<Nightboomfer> also animation'
<RainbowCrash> like*
<CogWeaver> no, Fid, she said their ages WERE IN ACTUALLITY 18-22
<xDaFreakshowx> "Ow, I burnt myself!"
<Barry> Hey, Sprinkles
<Fiddler> link?
<Barry> Hey, Dust
<CogWeaver> one sec
<RainbowCrash> ?
<Barry> Dusk*
<Barry> sorry
<CogWeaver> it's one of the notes or whatever in her DA account
<CogWeaver> lemme find it
<drfsupercenter> 03I edited my post with some links to verify that I didn't just make stuff up
<RainbowCrash> WTF i wanna play pony touhou but it keeps crashing -_-
<wurfless> All we can definitely confirm is that Fluttershy is a year older then pinkie pie
<sketch> speaking of academic things about the pony.. I don't quite get why Twilight has a seperate singing voice talent
<RainbowCrash> lawlz
<SirSprinkles> 6...XD
<HeinousActsZX> Yeah, the animation is the best I've ever seen in a cartoon, Bar none
<sketch> I thought Tara Strong could actually sing pretty well on her own right
<Nightboomfer> And Pinkie Pie's birthday is a day after Gummy's
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, I think people are just bored when they bash Fox, I don't really mind/care about it :P
<Fiddler> my view of the mane cast is now horrible
<xDaFreakshowx> Well because Animators stepped up to Flash OSX awww yeeaaaahhh
<Nightboomfer> They probably record multiple episodes in a row and don't want to damage her voice
<Silver_Heart> Gummy needs to be shipped with someone.
<Fiddler> atleas we still have derpy
<Silver_Heart> Gummy Shipped with Macintosh.
<Silver_Heart> >.>
<xDaFreakshowx> what?
<Fiddler> GUMMY X GILDA
<sketch> that makes sense Nightboom, she does have a ton of lines
<Nightboomfer> Gummy x Angel?
<xDaFreakshowx> lolwut?
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't watcn FNC
<drfsupercenter> 03I just watch WJBK local news
<drfsupercenter> 03and those guys are good XD

<wurfless> oh god, bwahaha
<Silver_Heart> What have a done?
<Silver_Heart> X3
<xDaFreakshowx> Gummy x Gummy...wait..what?
<Barry> I've got a fan fiction I want to post on EqD, but I want someone to look it over before I do. Would any of you mind?
<xDaFreakshowx> Derp.
<RainbowCrash> lol
<xDaFreakshowx> I derp'd
<Nightboomfer> Gumberg is my otp
<BlankFlankBrony> lol
<RainbowCrash> im still laughing at gummy x macintosh x3
<Fiddler> gummy knows what the mares want
<Silver_Heart> Gummy is absolutely adorable... some of the best part of that episode is Gummy's random antics.
<RainbowCrash> xDD
<Silver_Heart> Like bouncing around on a balloon.
<Nightboomfer> Gummy x Bucket of Turnips
<xDaFreakshowx> ha
<HeinousActsZX> Can we all agree that Lyra X Bon Bon is adorable?
<wurfless> Gummy x Rocky
<xDaFreakshowx> Gummy x Rocky
<xDaFreakshowx> aww
<xDaFreakshowx> you beat me to it
<wurfless> haha
<RainbowCrash> hah
<wurfless> great minds...
<Unidentified1052> wat
<Kovigary> hy
<xDaFreakshowx> lolwut*
<RainbowCrash> i can see it in a fan fic now
<disney> i just look up on lugia merchandise and i saw lugre lugia plush toy and its so huge and i want it if i can
<Fiddler> i want to read these fics
<disney> :D
<Nightboomfer> I wish the Pinkie Pie toy came with Gummy
<B-Man> You know, I was thinking about that NPR thing.
<sketch> >>goes to go grab an alcoholic refreshment. On that note though, I imagine BigMac has some mean distilled cider around there somehwere..
<RainbowCrash> gummy carresed rocky`s coarse hair as if she had some...blah blah blah
<HeinousActsZX> What about it?
<Fiddler> uhh
<B-Man> I think it would've been awesome if the caller had been like "I know about this because I am a brony myself!"
<xDaFreakshowx> There is a fanfic on FF.net where that is the case.
<B-Man> But what can ya do.
<B-Man> Luck of the draw.
<xDaFreakshowx> "Guardian of Equestria" last chapter
<wurfless> "Gummy admired his grizzled chin and rugged good looks..."
<xDaFreakshowx> human wants a drink and big mac points him to the back of AJ's apple cart
<Fiddler> wah?
<xDaFreakshowx> and it has hard cider
<Fiddler> this is getting freaky
<Nightboomfer> Eeyup
<xDaFreakshowx> it is
<xDaFreakshowx> ...
<Nightboomfer> Apple mead is extremely delicious
<xDaFreakshowx> Time to change topic.
<xDaFreakshowx> so...
<xDaFreakshowx> Ponies.
<xDaFreakshowx> How do they work?
<xDaFreakshowx> Magic?
<Nightboomfer> They are made out of gel and balljoints
<sketch> mm applemead
<Silver_Heart> >.>
<sketch> I imagine they do work on some kind of magic basis.. even earth ponies.. on that note
<Silver_Heart> Gummy + Princess Celestia.
<RainbowCrash> wow lots of bronies on dA like my FOX news pony pic lmao
<sketch> not even speaking about Pegasi and flying... wingspan and bone issues.. etc. Answer: magic
<SirSprinkles> 6I will I guess.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm bored stiff.
<RainbowCrash> and my other awesome artwerks!
<Fiddler> why are we speaking if fox?
<RainbowCrash> http://physicallypossible.deviantart.com/#/d3jcshq have you seen my pic yet?
<sketch> RainbowCrash, DA pony groups are good at mobbing new art, it's kinda fun
<Barry> http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7091680/1/Gokus_Strangest_Adventure This is it.
<Lunies> guysguys
<RainbowCrash> yes yes it is
<Lunies> I just saw a lightning bolt
<Lunies> INSIDE a rainbow
<SirSprinkles> 6>Goku
<SirSprinkles> 6lol wut?
<Nick> o-o
<Nick> wow
<Barry> It's an MLP/Dragonball x-over
<sketch> I have art that I really think is better.. but the first pony pic I do... bam, 100 favorites in 1 day, O.o
<Barry> Goku's a kid
<disney> i love lugia and simba<3:)
<RainbowCrash> you probably do i just started yesterday
<sketch> (no, not than you, relative to the pony pic I did)
<Nightboomfer> Ponies are made out of a gelatinous bacterial stack than can adjust to any situation, but must remain fixed around a cartilagenous skeleton comprised of full-range balljoints. A cutie mark is a localized section of bacteria created when a pony's special talent activates laten genes in their brain chemistry
<sketch> sorry, worded that wrong there :)
<User_9692> Ok I got a question. Princess Celest raises the sun over Equestria, and Luna raises the Moon. However Equestria is only a country. As stated by Twi. So how does one country of ponies have the right to rule of the moon and the sun? and only be a small country of ponies?
<SirSprinkles> 6XD wow
<CogWeaver> holy hay, walls of text!
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJERbX6XCJQ&feature=related
<Nightboomfer> Hollow Earth
<RainbowCrash> lol its cool
<Chromadancer> welcome princess celest
<disney> lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllliooooooo
<Nightboomfer> Maybe the pony world isn't really as big as our world
<Fiddler> p_n_
<sketch> Maybe ponies are the dominant species on the planet, and they are localized in equestria
<sketch> like a one-world-beneficial-dictatorship
<disney> >:(
<User_9692> Ok but that doesnt explain the size, How big is the country? It seems rather small seeing as they dont usual have dragons?
<ST_Falcon> MAZIN KAIZER
<Nightboomfer> n_ w_r_ n_t d_ing th_t ag_in
<RainbowCrash> ok well im gunna do some summer chem homework i really wanna get an
<sketch> indeed.. and if there were a lot of dragons you would think they would be the dominant species
<CogWeaver> User_9692: it's because it's a show, and while we're allow to overanalyze it all we want, that doesn't mean that it has to make sense in entirety
<Chromadancer> ____ ___'_ ___ _____ ____
<User_9692> Theyre seem to be a land or lands of dragons in which dont live in Equestria
<RainbowCrash> A to get the new kyocera echo
<Fiddler> y_s w_ _r_
*Chromadancer shot
<sketch> remember your stoichiometry :)
<Nightboomfer> I wonder how they eat and breathe, and other pony facts
<sketch> enjoy RainbowCrash
<RainbowCrash> lol
<Nightboomfer> (la la la)
<CogWeaver> Exactly, Nightboomfer
<disney> what?
<RainbowCrash> sketch i hate electron configurations!
<Barry> I'm mostly into crossovers
<RainbowCrash> xD
<sketch> lol
<User_9692> Seeing as one dragon when sleeping can possblie cover the country in smog
<Skylands> 10

<xDaFreakshowx> Stoichiometry!
<xDaFreakshowx> YEAH
<xDaFreakshowx> orbitals!
<RainbowCrash> i was in class and they were teaching it i was just like o.o
<Barry> It's not my only crossover, either
<xDaFreakshowx> p orbital is my waifu
<xDaFreakshowx> :B
<RainbowCrash> this makes...no...sense

<disney> helo
<CogWeaver> not-so-Fun-Fact: this has nothing to do with ponies

<CogWeaver> NOW
<RainbowCrash> ya it does!
<sketch> p oribital is my waifu is about the geekiest joke I've heard all day... and I laughed entirely too hard about it
<xDaFreakshowx> p stands for pony
<xDaFreakshowx> duhhh

<sketch> chemistry has to do with nearly everything :)
<xDaFreakshowx> Pony orbital
<RainbowCrash> yes
<Fiddler> q is for pony
<xDaFreakshowx> this statement is false.
<xDaFreakshowx> :)
<RainbowCrash> we must make a ponyodic table of elements
<sketch> except possibly gravitation... and maybe like unified fileds
<sketch> >>fields
<CogWeaver> this has no clear, direct relation to ponies
<CogWeaver> :P
<xDaFreakshowx> :P
<User_9692> So is there another nation of Ponies other than Equestria?
<CogWeaver> possibly
<Nightboomfer> wherever zecora comes from
<BlankFlankBrony> I've seen a ponyodic table of elements... dunno the link, though.
<xDaFreakshowx> yeah...
<Fiddler> some place
<RainbowCrash> twilightadium sparkite <- First ponyodic table element
<xDaFreakshowx> Pony equivalent of africa
<User_9692> So does Celestia and Luna rule them?
<disney> is someone is talking to me were is verebody
<xDaFreakshowx> hmmm
<xDaFreakshowx> idk
<RainbowCrash> Celestiadium
<xDaFreakshowx> THAT is a question
<sketch> You would think they would. "NO SUN FOR YOU!"
<RainbowCrash> imon a roll here
<RainbowCrash> lunadite
<User_9692> Seeing as she raises the sun only for Equestria?
<RainbowCrash> erm
<Fiddler> selfish ponies
<User_9692> ARe there other GOdlike Ponies or races?
<Fiddler> they need to learn the magic of friendship
<RainbowCrash> Rainbaidium Dashite
<Nightboomfer> maybe when she brings the sun back down, it's over in pony africa
<sketch> heh
<User_9692> Like is it a passing of the torch?
<Ray> 02Idle, like me
<BlankFlankBrony> Solar relay?

<sketch> enjoy rc
<xDaFreakshowx> Maybe...
<RainbowCrash> oh i will -_-
<User_9692> So did Luna cause a disruption across the entire planet? with the relay?
<Nightboomfer> Equus Sapiens Unicornus
<sketch> Maybe Celestia had to fill in on both relays
<xDaFreakshowx> Equus Sapiens [Unicornus]
<xDaFreakshowx> subrace...
<User_9692> Ponies evolved from Humans!
<xDaFreakshowx> :o
<sketch> I dunno.. they might be like dog breeds
<User_9692> Its the Future!
<Nightboomfer> then they'd be Homo Equus
<xDaFreakshowx> lol...Homo...*snicker snicker*
<User_9692> THis is the World of the future!@
<sketch> (the different subspecies I mean)
<xDaFreakshowx> old 6th grade joke is old.

<Kosoveon> ^
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Kosoveon :3
<sketch> Speaking of Eeyup, I love me some Big Macintosh
<sketch> I hope he gets more lines
<Nightboomfer> Jake sully, we're sending you to a mysterious planet. We call it Equestria, and in order to run with the natives, we have designed a specially made avatar for you
<Joshaloo> im in the process of turning a friend :P
<Fiddler> you guys are my VERY best friends
<Joshaloo> ponies in 3D?! :O
<Nightboomfer> ILU too fiddler
<CogWeaver> an Avatar remake with ponies??
<sketch> neat. As long as it's well done 3d and they don't do a "The last Airbender" on it
<sketch> god it was terrible
<CogWeaver> that...actually sounds like it could be pretty cool...
<PresentPerfect> hey, ponies, what's shakin'
<Joshaloo> 1/10 ive never seen such bad reviews lol
<Nightboomfer> what a twist!
<Ray> 02OoT Normal, or OoT3D?
<disney> who has watched bolt?
<sketch> exactly... dang you M. Night. twistalon
<Nightboomfer> M Night Shamylan's cutie mark would be a reel of film twisted in the middle
*Ray glomps Kosoveon
<Joshaloo> haha
<PresentPerfect> Night Twist is a cool pony name :V
*CogWeaver is so bored, he's tired, and is so tired, he's bored. It's a vicious cycle...*
<Nightmare_Moon> wingzero
<CogWeaver> ?
<PresentPerfect> all your moon are belong to us?
<CogWeaver> no
<CogWeaver> just no
<sketch> put some headphones on and pandora it up while you watch over us Mr Cog. It'll ease the hours
<sketch> lol... all your moon. I see what you did there
<CogWeaver> d...did you just call me "Mr Cog"...???
<CogWeaver> lolwAT?
<ST_Falcon> The moon is out!
<sketch> perhaps -.-
<sketch> heh
*ST_Falcon charges the satellite cannon.
<Fooby> Oh god what is this Derpybot D:
*CogWeaver fires the orbital friendship cannon at ST_Falcon's satellite cannon*
<sketch> ahem, let me correct that: Cogweaver, to make no assumptions
<Nightmare_Moon> So.. I've taken over Ponibooru as Nightmare, next stop, Ponychan.
<CogWeaver> mmk
<CogWeaver> have you taken EqDaily yet?
<PresentPerfect> haah?
<Nightmare_Moon> Yes
<Nightmare_Moon> I've teken EqD's comments and IRC
<Nightmare_Moon> *taken
<CogWeaver> mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
<CogWeaver> k
<ST_Falcon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3e3mzsL4Ks&feature=related
<disney> hey who's not talking anyone
<PresentPerfect> I don't think this quite counts as a 'takeover'
<PresentPerfect> I mean, you're here
<PresentPerfect> but that's about it
<sketch> lol.
<User_9354> This is probably often asked, but does anyone have any idea when Season 2 is supposed to air?
<CogWeaver> True, Present
<SirSprinkles> 6Looks pretty good. I'll probably keep reading it when more is written.
<Silver_Heart> December.
<Silver_Heart> That's what I've been told.
<PresentPerfect> I thought it was earlier than that, Septemberish
<User_9354> Dang, that's a long time to wait.
<CogWeaver> you're gonna have to take over Fireant or Zeke or Seth if you're gonna take over IRC
<User_9354> But thanks
<sketch> I think they just started animation
<CogWeaver> they have
<sketch> so I would assume -at least- late fall
<CogWeaver> just started
<Kosoveon> hi Angel_Espeon :3
<Kosoveon> and hi Ray :D
<PresentPerfect> I'm kind of nervous about season 2 :S
<Silver_Heart> O.o
<Silver_Heart> What?
<User_9354> What's the process? Do they animate first, or do all of the speaking?
<PresentPerfect> I've been dunking my brain in all this awesome fanon
<Silver_Heart> Is it up on youtube?!
*Kosoveon needs to rest for a while...isn't feeling well
<Kosoveon> I'll be back on in an hour or so
<PresentPerfect> and then to go back to canon...
<CogWeaver> they expected to air the first episode around mid-late october
<Nightmare_Moon> I call it a successful takeover. No other nightmare moon has really stood up to challenge my nightmare moon-ness. I suppose people don't like playing villians. Funny when you think about it, I was quite pathetic as a villian. My galaxy mane was cool though.
<PresentPerfect> they may very well screw up things like... Luna
<sketch> I don't think staff has been shaken up that much, besides Lauren anyway, who still had some say in Season 2
<Aeroslash> have a good rest, Kos
<Ray> 02'k~
<sketch> I hope Luna is done well
<PresentPerfect> Galaxy mane is sweet, yes
<sketch> that character has potential.
<Kosoveon|Away> thanks
<Kosoveon|Away> and be back in a bit
<CogWeaver> Cosmos' galaxy mane is cooler
<CogWeaver> and he's a good guy
<CogWeaver> so :P
<PresentPerfect> well, enjoy your takeover. we probably have muffins.
<Barry> Thanks
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ Cone2

<drf|laptop> 03in all honesty
<CogWeaver> no, only applepie
<Articuno> 12Where from?
<drf|laptop> 03just google "[name of game] nds rom"
<Articuno> 12Just tell me the site you're looking at
<HyperMetalLugia> 1. Buy a game 2. ROM Dump 3. Profit
<HyperMetalLugia> But eh
<drf|laptop> 03I use google.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;>
<CogWeaver> because applepie is the best pie
<CogWeaver> just as Applejack is the best pony
<sketch> that is tough to argue
<sketch> that is also tough to argue
<Articuno> 12Google just brings me rom sites which suck
<Articuno> 12The two I found gave me crap roms
<drf|laptop> 03not really
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03what games?
<drf|laptop> 03because
<PresentPerfect> shy pony is best pony :|
<drf|laptop> 03you might need to update AKAIO for them to run
<Articuno> 12Just Art academy
<drf|laptop> 03the ROMs themselves might be perfectly fine
<Wunderbar> ok
<Dashie|semi-AFK> Capitalization and punctuation.
<CogWeaver> meh
<Free> ooh.
<drf|laptop> 03try downloading the newest AKAIO from their site
<Articuno> 12both were blank when I tried to run them, just a white screen
<Articuno> 12Ok :>
<sketch> I'm a sucker for a tomboy with freckles I guess
<PresentPerfect> speed and accuracy!
<CogWeaver> I'm too tired, thus bored/bored, thus tired to care, Dashie
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03I think the ROMs are fine
<drf|laptop> 03that sounds like a software problem
<Lucas> COG.
<disney> articuno do u like bolt?
<CogWeaver> yeah Lucas?
<Articuno> 12It's one of my fav films
<drf|laptop> 03EW MILEY CYRUS
<drf|laptop> 03All I have to say about that
<Articuno> 12Like I care about the voices
<drf|laptop> 03I refuse to watch any movie with her in it
<Lucas> If you see Rev, use my name to make a ding for me so I know he's here...
<drf|laptop> 03I totally care about the voices
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol
<SilverSonic> Lmao of course drf would say that
<Articuno> 12She's not in it, only her voice is
<drf|laptop> 03it's why the new dub of Pokémon sucks
<HyperMetalLugia> He's so obvious
<drf|laptop> 03because the voices suck
<CogWeaver> mmk
<drf|laptop> 03therefore, VAs matter
<drf|laptop> 03and they matter a lot
<Articuno> 12It ALL sucks
<HyperMetalLugia> Subtitles?!
<Articuno> 12The whole dub, the script, everything
<drf|laptop> 03not the original voices
<drf|laptop> 03no way
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes, the new anime sucks :x
<CogWeaver> or I'll just have DerpyBot send you a message
<drf|laptop> 03but yes
<Articuno> 12The original is for 2 year olds lol
<drf|laptop> 03the new anime sucks anyway
<Free> Fancy.
<CogWeaver> but yeah, I will
<drf|laptop> 03Black and White/Best Wishes/wtf it is
<drf|laptop> 03that show sucks horribly
<Articuno> 12They all do

<Articuno> 12No offence but NASCAR means nothing to a Brit LOL
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03let me put it this way
<drf|laptop> 03only people who sponsor a car can enter the pit
<HyperMetalLugia> Just like how no Americans care about BBC?
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<sketch> by the by, and hoping this does not step too far over PG. Crown and Cherry Dr Pepper really is quite good
<Articuno> 12Probably lolz
<Articuno> 12brb sorry
<drf|laptop> 03BBC is cool
<HyperMetalLugia> I know :>
<drf|laptop> 03but the only cool stuff on it is Top Gear
<HyperMetalLugia> BBC world news
<drf|laptop> 03because EW THE AMERICAN TOP GEAR
<Lucas> Ok thnaks
<HyperMetalLugia> And top gear, fine :P
<HyperMetalLugia> BBC-A ftw
<drf|laptop> 03I want BBC America HD :(
<drf|laptop> 03however
<HyperMetalLugia> I have it
<drf|laptop> 03it's not really ftw
<drf|laptop> 03because
<drf|laptop> 03PAL to NTSC conversion
<HyperMetalLugia> But...it is blank :|
<drf|laptop> 03= BAD
<HyperMetalLugia> I know, PAL X.x
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03there's not'hing wrong with PAL
<Nick> I wouldn't let you touch what? o0
<CogWeaver> !derp
<drf|laptop> 03in fact it's better quality than NTSC
<drf|laptop> 03But
<HyperMetalLugia> Slow
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<drf|laptop> 03I want the show in its NATIVE format
<drf|laptop> 03HyperMetalLugia
<CogWeaver> !muffins
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<drf|laptop> 03NTSC is 24fps
<drf|laptop> 03PAL is 24
<drf|laptop> 03*25
<disney> i love beverly hills chihahauha and the2and one<3
<Nick> and HI ARTI :)
<twentypercentcooler> Muffins?
<sketch> !muffins
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<drf|laptop> 03that whole 30fps thing is just a technical term, movies and the like are 24

<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Dashie> !muffins

<twentypercentcooler> muffins
<HyperMetalLugia> Well how confusing then
<twentypercentcooler> the heck is this nonsense?
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<CogWeaver> don't spam DerpyBot with muffins...
<drf|laptop> 03basically all you need to know is
<drf|laptop> 03original format is the best
<PresentPerfect> wat
<disney> its a disney moveis
<drf|laptop> 03so for BBC, that's PAL. Therefore BBC America, which is NTSC = bad
<HyperMetalLugia> Including if it is NTSC :P
<Dashie> Congratulations Cog.
<Dashie> You win.
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't really notice anything really bad
<CogWeaver> ...
<HyperMetalLugia> But eh, conversion is bad anyway I guess
<drf|laptop> 03Yes, it lets me watch BBC, but so do torrents
<Fooby> Wait, muffins?
<HyperMetalLugia> But why waste disk space and bandwidth ;p
<CogWeaver> no muffins
<CogWeaver> only pie
<Fooby> Someone explain to me what DerpyBot is :U
<Dashie> !pie
<HyperMetalLugia> Though I do use a proxy to watch BBC live/iPlayer XD
<Dashie> Oh hey it worked.
<drf|laptop> 03because I have disk space to spare?
<HyperMetalLugia> Much safer :>
<PresentPerfect> a bot
<CogWeaver> Fooby, just type "!help" for assistance on DerpyBot
<Fiddler> will someone hug me?/
<Fiddler> please?
<Starlancer> yo
<Dashie> !hug
*PresentPerfect hugs Fiddler. "What's up?"
<twentypercentcooler> So awesome, saw this little kid pass by with friends and their parents, now imagine this in the most high pitch little boys voice you can, like the most cute voice you can imagine of a little 6-7 year old: "REALLY? I MET SOMEONE THAT DIED ONCE TOO!"
<Fiddler> yay
<Fiddler> thank you
<BlankFlankBrony> !help

<Nick> wait what Arti
<Articuno> 12^v^

<Articuno> 12When I tried to get rid of them before you wouldn't let me >v>

<Articuno> 12*sigh* Nevermind, you didn't read up XD
<johnsey> i guess i still need to add some spam protection nevertheless
<Articuno> 12Um Because he's my friend maybe??
<CogWeaver> so does DerpyBot have any kick/ban capabilities?
<johnsey> like, only 2 muffins per minute
<Nick> I am but I can't see what it is specifically you're talking about xD

<FlutterAwesome> I want some popcorn...

<Tirek> I was causing eternal night when you were just a filly
<twentypercentcooler> kettle corn
<Unidentified4829> grrrr
<PresentPerfect> back in my day, eternal night lasted longer'n just a few hours! *waves cane*
<Nightmare_Moon> Not you, NightmareMoon, the one that came in half dressed and possibly drunk from some party.
*BlankFlankBrony passes popcorn around and starts making kettle corn
*Tirek unleashes the rainbow... of Darkness!

*twentypercentcooler desides to make some hurricane corn
<PresentPerfect> someone may have registered the nick, Unid
<Lucas> :D
<twentypercentcooler> I PRAY you all know what that is
<Luna> j
<Nightmare_Moon> We have a Luna, and every other manecast character regged
<Luna> yay
<Tirek> Hey, Nightmare moon, you're looking like a fine filly. Let's make this night last forever
<PresentPerfect> can't say I've heard of it, twenty
<ZekeS> o_o
<Lucas> HOGGING EVERY MANECAST NICK IS NOT FAIR
<twentypercentcooler> Hawaiian popcorn, popcorn with nori and Japanese crackers
<twentypercentcooler> all blended into one
<twentypercentcooler> ^ ^
<PresentPerfect> that does not sound appetizing D:
<Unidentified21188> If that guy changes my name ONE MORE TIME, i am leaving
<Nightmare_Moon> No Tirek, I have no plans to let sister drag her pets out all the way to Everfree castle again, just to get blasted by rainbows, again..... for a third time.
<twentypercentcooler> ...
<twentypercentcooler> haha
<FlutterAwesome> oooh that sounds tasty
<FlutterAwesome> pass it over
<CogWeaver> we have too many Nightmare Moons here
<PresentPerfect> of course, I prefer my popcorn salted, no butter
<PresentPerfect> or with caramel
<PrincessLuna> yay
<Tirek> Yeah, that happened to me once. Never use a rainbow of darkness against a rainbow of light
*BlankFlankBrony starts making a popcornucopia
<twentypercentcooler> now what doesnt sound appetizing, is that stupid SPAM POPCORN, they sell at the hawaiian tourist traps
<twentypercentcooler> > . >
<Tirek> also never threaten to kill Spike the Dragon in front of your henchmen
<twentypercentcooler> my gosh, Spam flavor popcorn?
<CogWeaver> eww...
<PrincessLuna> But IF you change it one more time,bye
<disney> what is it?
<Nightmare_Moon> PrincessLuna: you can't stop the nickserv, its there to prevent users from impersonating who they're not.
<PrincessLuna> .........
<Nightmare_Moon> Nopony is changing your name.
<HeatWave> It's also automated.
<PrincessLuna> Good
<Lucas> Lol ain't that the truth
<PrincessLuna> h

<PrincessLuna> that was fun
<Nightmare_Moon> Not really, impersonating a mane character badly can result in your forever shame and hatred.
<twentypercentcooler> haha
<Nightmare_Moon> Like the drunk at a stagparty with a lamp on their head.
<twentypercentcooler> shunned forever
<Tirek> Too true, unless you thrive on pain and hatred...
<Tirek> mwhahahahaha!
<twentypercentcooler> oh gosh

<HeatWave> Whoops.
<Tirek> that's fricking weird
*CogWeaver is so tired, he's bored, and is so so bored, he's tired...*
<PresentPerfect> I keep my levels up by battling spiders constantly

<twentypercentcooler> I ended up on the ground covered in random burrito and I was like: THE HAY?
<PresentPerfect> so the low-level stuff can't take me down so easily
<twentypercentcooler> No, could have been poison haha
<CogWeaver> AH NOEZ
<CogWeaver> MAH LAPTOP IZ GONNA DIE SOON!
