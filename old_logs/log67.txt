<RainBroDash> I used to dwell too much on getting my happiness online. I've started spending more time online since ponies, mainly because of BronyState, so I guess that's not a great thing, since I've stopped going out friday and saturday nights now >.>
<Light_Latias> 12I wish Danny was around to see that joke D:

<Dman> 0w
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<May> 14I don't see anything that says battle
<RainBroDash> In fact, come to think of it I've really neglected some people since BronyState D:
<Dman> 0apokalipse, y ... you know what i'd rather not say
<Skylands> 10Uh
<Sathi> 7told you it was hard

<Espeon> 06No one says it has to be competitive.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> ok first off i'm sorry
<RainBroDash> ABOUT WHAT? ;_;
<RainBroDash> (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
<Espeon> 06If anything I'll probably end up trying to make veeon teams or something silly like that :p
<May> 14I just did what I normally do for Pokemon lol
<HuffytheMagicDragon> being an ass and spamming linkz
<Skylands> 10A team full of Espeon only
<RainBroDash> wat
<Skylands> 10Glorious
<Espeon> 06That would be unfairly overpowered though.
<Espeon> 06:U
*Espeon dies
<HuffytheMagicDragon> I got banned remember/
<Skylands> 10lmao
<HuffytheMagicDragon> ?
<May> 14Okay so, note to self

<Kyu> 07o3o
<Sathi> 7told you its hard :P
<Espeon> 06but it's
<Espeon> 06Flareon

<Espeon> 06LOL slenderman-inspired mob much?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> its on my wall on facebook

<HuffytheMagicDragon> anyway they'res also this great vid on youtube called [MMD] Possibly the 3rd most retarded thing you've seen today?
<Kyu> 07and of course I like Flareon too

<Dman> 0huffeh
<Pegacorn> @RobotPinkie:Why did you say "rape imminent"?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> THAnkz i just commented
<RobotPinkie> to the "OMG!HUFFY!" :P
<Aurora> 6you could teach it retaliate
<Aurora> 6make it a decent mid-battle pokemon
<Dusky> Back

<Dman> 0yes, why
<Kyu> 07lol
<HuffytheMagicDragon> quite
<Pegacorn> At the time?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lived by the sea
<Sathi> 7woeii finished it
<Sathi> 7with the german guy
<Pegacorn> ohai Sathi
<HuffytheMagicDragon> frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called (Sumthin
<Sathi> 7ohai :)
<Dman> 0nice
<May> 14I hate night time in Minecraft

<May> 14actually now

<May> 14not a jungle
<Dusky> You gott slammed in a ungle?
<Aurora> 6just wait till it rains lol
<Dusky> O.o
<May> 14I hate rain
<May> 14I can't see anything for fish sake
*RainBroDash is about to throw away 30L worth of empty 2L bottles of pepsi max
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i could imagine coach and louis running a pharmacy
<Aurora> 6and monsters are free to roam lol
<HuffytheMagicDragon> damn
<Pattyrick> Back
<May> 14wb
<RobotPinkie> Can you play with PC players if you get L4D for the 360?
<May> 14also, the terrain my world happens to be in
<RainBroDash> Nope
<Pegacorn> inb4 PILLZ
<Pegacorn> FOOTBALL!YEAH!
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta take some of my things back upstairs.
<May> 14it's like some stupid island thing
<May> 14island hopping
<May> 14everywhere
<RobotPinkie> damn
<Dman> 0robotpinkie, nah
<Dman> 0yea...
<May> 14There's pools of water, and the jungle stuff, then random cows/sheeps
<May> 14I found a pig, but I killed it hoping for some pork
<May> 14It didn't work
<Pattyrick> Baaaaahhhhh
<RainBroDash> Microsoft tested PC vs Xbox for multiplayer gaming, but PC players destroyed Xbox players so hard (even in casual vs casual) that it wasn't a viable system to implement
<Aurora> 6yeh some pigs wont give pork
<Pattyrick> Thanks May
<Dman> 0rainbrodash - dat MW2 video
<Dusky> Go smash the walls for pork!
<RobotPinkie> Well, yeah, but L4D is cooperative, right?
<Dusky> Castlevenia reference
<Dman> 0'oh my gooood. oh my gooood! he's such a wallhacker. JUSTLEMTEKILLYOU#
<Dman> 0hahaha
<RainBroDash> and since multiplayer fps is like the 2nd biggest money earner in gaming, that makes it not worth it to do it at all
<May> 14I think it's amazing that the human can use its bare hands to take down trees and break holes in the wall
<May> 14I wouldn't be able to do that
<RobotPinkie> Sony allowed it for Portal 2, though.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i got cut by an ice cube a few days ago, and therefore i am mortal
<Dman> 0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnZvrjv1_JI
<Dman> 0view. profit with lulz.
<Kyu> 07I can.
<RainBroDash> yeah robotpinkie, but imagine the crying on the forums if only certain games got xbox-pc link :P
<Pegacorn> i'm back
*Kyu flees
<Dman> 0robotpinkie - more like valve did it but yea
<Pattyrick> Lol, bootlegged Android tablet :P
<Kyu> 07granted, it has to be really young trees and thin walls
<May> 14Lol Kyu
<Kyu> 07but still
*Kyu flees louder
*Sathi 7prays for a weekend sale on killfloor
<RobotPinkie> Well Valve did the implementation, but that's kind of useless if not allowed.
<RainBroDash> robotpinkie that was steam-sony doing a collab though to help each other. Xbox Live is a much more singular entity, since it's a subscription service that costs, and stuff
<Dman> 0Sathi - friend gets it for like 4$ offer, then says its good so i get for 20, then summer sale and it's 5 again
<Link> !espeon
<Link> :3
*Espeon now belongs to Link for 17 minutes
<Dman> 0WHY MEEE
<RobotPinkie> And I don't really see much crying on PS3 forums over Portal 2
<HuffytheMagicDragon> and stuff
<Dman> 0also, sathi, i love that game nad it runs fine! : P
<RainBroDash> Sathi it was so cheap before, you really missed out ;P
<Pegacorn> Xbox 360 sucks in my opinion.
<Sathi> 7yer I know
<RainBroDash> oh god, console war here we go
<Sathi> 7instead I got left4
<RobotPinkie> lol I love all consoles.... except the Wii :P
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i got the old one and itz SO AWESOME
<Dman> 0Wii is best teehee
<Sathi> 7wii follow up looks interesting
<RainBroDash> No consoles suck. There.
<Pegacorn> I don't like the Wii either
<HuffytheMagicDragon> right There
<Dman> 0Wii U mad?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> .
<Barry> The Wii is pretty good
<RobotPinkie> Wii U looks cool.
<RainBroDash> The Wii doesn't suck. All the games since 1 year after release suck
<Pegacorn> All of them have things that the others don't.
<Barry> Even Mario Galaxy 2?
<RainBroDash> also: the new zelda should be released on gamecube not wii :P
<interior_gummy> eh, most of the good wii games are the ones made by nintendo itself
<RobotPinkie> Well, Wii is pretty much for first party titles, as far as I'm concerned.
<RainBroDash> and yeah barry I dislike both mario galaxys
<Barry> Won't happen
<Dman> 0rainbrodash, wat
<interior_gummy> mario, zelda, smash bros, etc
<Dman> 0metroid!
<RainBroDash> dman, they suck. just face it
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i like crimson skies
<RainBroDash> :P
<Pegacorn> I don't like Mario Galaxy.Mario is overrated nowadays.
<Barry> Skyward Sword requires the Wii Motion Plus
<interior_gummy> i'll get a 3ds when more games come out for it, excited for paper mario
<Pegacorn> Nintendo Power sucks nowadays.
<Dman> 0Rainbrodash, how bout no. MG1 beat COD4 in reviews
<Dman> 0ofc, reviewers suck but he
<RainBroDash> >implying reviews mean shit
<Dman> 0Nintendo Magazine, in UK. and it's awesome
<Dman> 0Thats what i said rainbrodash
<Dman> 0but eh i like 'em
<RobotPinkie> lol
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i upgraded all planes and now i got excess like 54 upgrade tokens after beating like 3 times
<Barry> They do
<RobotPinkie> Pony console wars!
<HuffytheMagicDragon> wait a sec
<RainBroDash> Also: WHY DID THE WII PAPER MARIO SUCK SO HARD ;_;
<RobotPinkie> I think Pong was an awesome game console.
<Barry> All reviews are is word of mouth that something is going to be either good or bad
<Dman> 0the nintendo sixtypony is the best nintendo
<Pegacorn> They just say:"OMG it Nintendoh so it awsum." or "OMG nut Nintendoh so it sukz."
<RainBroDash> The N64 one - GREAT. Thousand Year Door: AMAZING. Oh, sick, a good Wii game since Twilight Princess, sweet OH NO WAIT THIS SUCKS
<Dman> 0that's a magazine for ya
<RobotPinkie> I mean the accuracy you got with the pong controller is unrivalled even today!
<Barry> By the way, Nintendoh is a fan-created flash episode
<Dman> 0RainBroDash

<RobotPinkie> Also not to stoke the flames, but Pong > Space Invaders
<RainBroDash> if people didn't know RBD is a zelda fanboy: http://i.imgur.com/izGg7.png
<Pegacorn> I was talking about Nintendo Power's noobish fanboy reviews.
<Barry> Zelda games are great, well, most of them. I will admit they dropped the bball with TP
<RainBroDash> zoom in on the gamecube :3
<Barry> ball*
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol pong
<RainBroDash> I gree barry, but I liked the game anyway
<Dman> 0ok found just uploading to the world wide ponyweb
<RainBroDash> agree*
<Razyn> Nice Battlestation, RBD
<Barry> They cut out a lot of stuff that would make the game unique
<Dman> 0Razyn wait till you see the ninjamote
<RainBroDash> Suddenly, Razyn. and ty :>

<RobotPinkie> both are awesome
<HuffytheMagicDragon> Oot?
<interior_gummy> my favorite game is still super mario world
<RobotPinkie> Ocarina of Time
<HuffytheMagicDragon> dat new one/
<Pegacorn> I think OoT is boring(again,just my opinion)
<Dman> 0>what is OoT >yes i know what a videogame is.
<Barry> WW was good actually, but could have been better if they didn't try to stay within the assigned release date
<RainBroDash> Fukken LOL Dman
<Barry> If they had pushed it back, they could have made it better
<Dman> 0yo rainbrodash imma let you finish and all, but http://i.imgur.com/klDsI.jpg
<Barry> or worse
<Razyn> Dman: http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s213/qinop/1311547878419.jpg
<Barry> we won't really know
<Dman> 0lol razyn
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I see very few flaws in WindWaker
<HuffytheMagicDragon> still awesaome digrahm
<Dman> 0WW is amazing
<HuffytheMagicDragon> world wars/
<RobotPinkie> Only thing that's kinda shit is one of the bosses
<Barry> Maybe, but they could have done without the triforce quest

<Hipster_Brony> 8the person who was a security guard is a no too, because he said his dad worked in an office
<Pattyrick> Yay for creepers
<interior_gummy> lemme try a lie...
<french> lets just wait and see if he says anything - if we are saying this is all a troll, then yeah, he was a pretty big troll. But if it's just us misunderstanding, or not giving him the chance to explain at the very least, then I for one would feel like a massive douche...
<Pattyrick> The Minecraft kind
<RobotPinkie> I'd just hate to accidentally attack someone if it turns out to be true, no matter how implausible.
<interior_gummy> turns out i am barack obama's illegitimate son, but he paid me not to talk
<Dman> 0if he doesn't respond in any way, i guess he was a troll
<Dman> 0yea robotpinkie same
<RainBroDash> french hence my stance. Ignoring him is a good idea :L
<AlCapony> What are we talking about now?
<french> (turns out the 51 yr old was half royal... was kim royal?)
<Dman> 0alcapony - kim fluttershy possibly lying

<Glacymr> 12no wonder XD
<NightSeas> 12lol
<RobotPinkie> I've just started studying welsh :3

<Dave_BroZilla> Which part of Canada, Pegacorn?
<Dman> וואָס איצט גייז?
<RobotPinkie> hebrew?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02...
<Pegacorn> @Dave_BroZilla:Quebec.
<RainBroDash> the only welsh word i know: Lifft
<Glacymr> 12wb
<SilverSonic> :o
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Pattyrick> Wb xD
<Dman> i know yr is 'the'
<interior_gummy> when you google "the best pony is" on google images, the first to come up is pinkie pie
<Dman> and bus is 'BUS
<Ziltoid> lies
<RainBroDash> pegacorn donc tu parles francais? :D
<RobotPinkie> my favorite welsh word thus far is ystafell
<Dave_BroZilla> Figured as much, aha. Quebec City? Montreal? St. Donat?
<Pegacorn> You RainBroDash
<Dman> Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, a railway station on the island of Anglesey in Wales, is the longest place name in the Welsh language. 51 letters long in the Welsh alphabet, the name can be translated as "St Mary's church in the hollow of the white hazel near to the rapid whirlpool and the church of St Tysilio of the red cave". How
<Dman> ver, it was artificially contrived in the 1860s as a publicity stunt, to give the station the longest name of any railway station in the United Kingdom.
<RobotPinkie> It's crazy hard to pronounce
<Dman> Wat, welshmen, just wat
<Pegacorn> @Dave_BroZilla:Province of Quebec
<Ziltoid> what
<Pegacorn> *province
<Dave_BroZilla> You so sly
<RainBroDash> je l'ai pris a l'ecole, mais je ne le parlais depuis quelques quelques mois >.>
<Dman> The longest word in the Swedish language is according to Guinness World Records Nordöstersjökustartilleriflygspaningssimulatoranläggningsmaterielunderhållsuppföljningssystemdiskussionsinläggsförberedelsearbeten (130 letters). It means "Northern Baltic Sea Coast Artillery Reconnaissance Flight Simulator Facility Equipment Maintenance Follow-Up System Discussio
<Dman> n Post Preparation Work(s)." Since two words are written together to form new words, multiple words can be put together to make even longer words.[citation needed]
<Dman> What now robotpinkie?
<RainBroDash> (@pegacorn, that was)
<Ziltoid> queleues queleues
<Pegacorn> C'est correct RainBroDash.
<RobotPinkie> Ystafell is hard to pronounce, Dman
<NightSeas> 12wB
<Dman> at least french is fine
<Dman> The longest usual word in French is anticonstitutionnellement (25 letters), meaning "anticonstitutionally" (in a way which is not conforming to the constitution).
<RobotPinkie> It's like... ridiculously far from how it's spelled
<Dman> WTF TURKISH
<Dman> Muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmişsinizcesine	Like you would be from those we can not easily/quickly make a maker of unsuccessful ones
<RainBroDash> Pegacorn, so my french wasn't too bad? :3
<Dman> that ONE WORD means THAT?
<Dave_BroZilla> Blagvak in Gobbledogook
<Dave_BroZilla> Means pickaxe to Goblins
<RobotPinkie> haha
<Pegacorn> Nope RainBroDash,in fact,it was great
<Glacymr> 12there
<Glacymr> 12made a small modification
<Dave_BroZilla> Antidisestablishmentarianism
<Dave_BroZilla> Longest word in English language
<Dman> dave_brozilla
<Dman> wrong
<Dave_BroZilla> grargh
<Dave_BroZilla> whhyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

<Dman> Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
<Dman> is longest english word
<Aurora> 6to what
<RobotPinkie> Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is not a real word.

<interior_gummy> if she can draw them on the spot, yes
<Aurora> 6I checked the "new posts since your last visit"
<Aurora> 6nothing there
<Dman> black dynamite would win, unless ponies
<interior_gummy> and she has the combined powers of pegasi and unicorns
<thetrollside> what if she already has them drawn?
<Dave_BroZilla> But nunchuks
<RobotPinkie> Then I'd say Faust, because ponies.

<Dman> Razyn u so slow pony

<HuffytheMagicDragon> equestriadaylightsavings.com
<InsertCupcake> hi NewManiac
<TGPFluttershy> Hello NewManiac!
<RainBroDash> 10espylacopa the thing is that a lot of people mistake things like GMT and BST, and you have to assume that when people say GMT they mean 'British Time at the moment'
<EspyLacopa> Just because people use it interchangeably doesn't mean it's correct.
*Pegacorn looks downwards and sees a gian Gummy-bot
<EspyLacopa> I don't assume.
<Pegacorn> *giant
<RainBroDash> 10Yes but you have to realise that a lot of people do
<EspyLacopa> They say GMT, that's what I'm going with.
<RainBroDash> 10And stop being so high and mighty about it >.>
<HuffytheMagicDragon> go gummy go gummy it ur birthday!
<Combustiblelemons> What RBD said.
<EspyLacopa> That does not mean it's correct though
<interior_gummy> 0it's not my birthday though
<RainBroDash> 10Exactly. So realise a lot of people get shit wrong man
<Apokalipse> He never said it does
<HuffytheMagicDragon> arrogance!
*RobotPinkie Mecha Gummy fizzles and stops suddenly, his left eye pops out and thumps into the ground.
<RainBroDash> 10and WORK with it
<InsertCupcake> If im honest theres not many instances where I am confronted with GMT cos people just say 11 oclock
<EspyLacopa> Bah.
<Pinkamina> lol
<Combustiblelemons> It was my birthday 9 days ago D:
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol interior
<Pinkamina> lololololololololololol
<EspyLacopa> I'm not about to make mistakes just because everyone else wants to.
<InsertCupcake> it would be silly to say GMT in england in everyday conversation
<HuffytheMagicDragon> to bad then its ur unbirthday
<RobotPinkie> Ah damn, I was sure I fixed that. :(
<scatr> aaaaaaaaaaa veryy merry unbirthday to you!
<scatr> (now in my head forever)
<NewManiac> It's been a while since I've been here, so I need to ask: will we be playing random music behind a GIF of Gummy dancing this week?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol mad hatter
<InsertCupcake> 1000 spins
<Combustiblelemons> Unbirthday is death?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> yes
<Combustiblelemons> Idk >.>
<HuffytheMagicDragon> gummy dance
<RainBroDash> 10EspyLacpoa congratulations. You're smarter than 90% of the population :P now in order to become smarter than 95% of the population you need to realise that 'being right' isn't always as important as 'working fluidly with all the people who aren't always right' :D
<scatr> unbirthday = every day that isn't your birthday
<Apokalipse> no, an unbirthday would be a day that you weren't born on
<RainBroDash> 10also: typo in your name due to fast ragetype :D
<Apokalipse> ahh ninja'd
<HuffytheMagicDragon> OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhh
<RobotPinkie> Now your undeathday, that's a special day in any pony's life.
<Pegacorn> Hum.Looks like RobotPinkie is awake.
<Combustiblelemons> And then RainBroDash became my favourite mod.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> clockchaos
<RobotPinkie> Usually happens slightly before a zombie apocalypse.
<Apokalipse> he wasn't your favorite mod before? Blasphemy
<Combustiblelemons> meh they were all equal
*Pegacorn is now on the ground,looking downwards at RobotPinkie

<InsertCupcake> Well we were getting burned earlier for not greeting Bronies
<Combustiblelemons> A-movie*
<Ayralynn> I missed last week
<interior_gummy> 0no, it's the b movie
<EspyLacopa> RainBroDash: It doesn't bother me as much that you're getting it wrong, it's that youre doing it intentionally. To me, it feels like you're insulting everyone
*Pegacorn punches RobotPinkie in DA FACE
<EspyLacopa> gah
<ValtheJean> oh lol
<Ghosties> Yep
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i got banned last week
<Combustiblelemons> sounds terrible :/
<RobotPinkie> Hey! Why you do that for?

<Combustiblelemons> Forgot the real B movie D:
<EspyLacopa> stupid enter key

<HuffytheMagicDragon> :/ it haunts me
<interior_gummy> 4Sprinkles kicked (not here yet)
<Apokalipse> Evil dead III is the B movie
<Combustiblelemons> ....and the pony eps too. I think one was best night ever.
<Razyn> Now Pegacorn, that's not very nice.
<Pegacorn> Ok,i'm sorry RobotPinkie
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol soccer again
<EspyLacopa> It's like, "Oh, they can't learn it, I'll just dumb it down for them so that they don't have to."
<Dashite> Oh right...
<Dashite> It's movie night tonight.
<Dashite> That would explain the 60+ people.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> naw rly?

<RainBroDash> 10EspyLacopa it wasn't ME who got it wrong. The one person who got it wrong, got it wrong. I will tell them that they got it wrong. Both you and I know the difference between GMT and BST dude
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<nickstr> there is one some people might mistake for Quagmire
<HuffytheMagicDragon> rly?
*Pegacorn looks around and sees that the radius of the nukes made the world look like Fallout
<junh1024-XD> Interior Crocodile Alligator
<InsertCupcake> NO WAI!

<junh1024-XD> I drive a Cheverolet Movie Theater
*junh1024-XD hides
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol crop circles1
<Combustiblelemons> Cant tell if espy is trolling... ...or serious.
*Silverscreen 11just says EST and lets others translate the time. :P
<RobotPinkie> Fallout: New Ponyville
<RainBroDash> 10Nopony is insulting anypony. One mod made a mistake, essentially akin to a typo. I will help them get it right next time :P
<Dman> Lol silverscreen. but like so many are UK viewers
<HuffytheMagicDragon> keeptrollingtrollingtrollingtrolling
<Razyn> Silverscreen: like a baws
<RainBroDash> 10Silverscreen mfw I bet you don't actually use EST in summer. You use EDT
<Ayralynn> I found the list: Evil Dead III, then Winter Wrap-up, then sonic rainboom, then across the universe
<Dman> RainBroDash it's all so confusing!
<Pegacorn> brb
<HuffytheMagicDragon> what across universe bout?
<ValtheJean> howdy from San Diego UK viewers!
<Dman> why can't we all use just one time?
<Combustiblelemons> Yay sonic rainboom!
<InsertCupcake> Im in England and I just say 20 past 11
<nickstr> the center of my ghetto boombox came out of a GM vehicle
<RainBroDash> 10Ayralynn the list is on the 'HOME' link at the top and bottom of the page :D
<Silverscreen> 11RainBroDash: mfw I don't know the difference. 6_9
<Dman> and people be waking up at 2am and bed at 8pm, and stuff, but still
<RainBroDash> 10ValtheJean HOWDY! :D
<nickstr> as far as I know it could have been a Chevy
<EspyLacopa> Dman: Because the earth is round.
<Combustiblelemons> Idk, I'm going to sleep when across the universe comes on.
<EspyLacopa> :P
<NewManiac> Yay! Across the Universe is on of my favorite movies!
<ValtheJean> :D
<Dman> EspyLacopa but it would work!
<Dermathil_Windsor> I dun' think I'll be capable of watching Army Of Darkness. I got a 11yo in the room I am in who wants to play Rock Band
<Combustiblelemons> Sounds terrible.
<interior_gummy> 0i wonder how many times "yay" will be spammed at the beginning of sonic rainboom
<RainBroDash> 10@EspyLacopa look at what silverscreen said. A lot of people just don't -know- so don't hate them for it, ok?>
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i say it like digital its six twenty five
<AlCapony> :|
<Apokalipse> Combustiblelemons... but you've not even seen it yet
<Combustiblelemons> over 9000?
<TGPFluttershy> inb4 "yay~"
<thetrollside> HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE STAND MUSICALS?!
<ValtheJean> inb4 yay becomes the new toot :P
<InsertCupcake> many yays if its anything like monday
<Dman> dermatihl_windsor - there's a kid in the room who's playing on the wii and wants me to wear headphones ^_^
<HuffytheMagicDragon> yes over 9000
<Combustiblelemons> I get bad vibes from movie names.
<NewManiac> Huffy, Across the Universe is like Mamma Mia. But with the Beatles.
<RobotPinkie> I predict that the beginning of sonic rainboom will earn a +m rating...
<Combustiblelemons> this one seems questionable
<Dman> rainbrodash hate police now?
<Dman> 0_o
<EspyLacopa> RainBroDash: They aren't the ones that annoy me.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i never saw mama mia
<Pegacorn> ok i'm back
<Ayralynn> So will the song for winter wrap-up
<HuffytheMagicDragon> but thankz
<Flutterpeanut> NYAN
<Apokalipse> That has to be one of the stupidest things I've heard in the last 10 minutes
<Dman> (Silverscreen PM)
<scatr> are we counting the film version of mary poppins as a musical, or is that stretching it too far?
<ValtheJean> oh god, the implications of winter wrap up! Obviously by winter they mean "cleavage" and wrap up they mean "orgy"
<Razyn> Pegacorn, good. Now try to use your Alicorn magic to fix the world.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i learned the simple WWU on the piano in two days
<NewManiac> Huffy, Mamma Mia is a musical made up of songs from Abba.
<RobotPinkie> So how many awards did Winter Wrap Up win for "best song ever"?
<interior_gummy> 0clevage orgy?
<interior_gummy> 0yay
<ValtheJean> yup :P
<Apokalipse> lol
<interior_gummy> 0best song in the show is at the gala
<InsertCupcake> Also spam of 'PLOT' and 'Flank'
<Combustiblelemons> naw winter wrap up is number one.
<TGPFluttershy> brb
<interior_gummy> 0cupcakes also
<Dman> WWU is best episode
<InsertCupcake> NAw Giggle at the Ghostie
<Ayralynn> I prefer art of the dress
<HuffytheMagicDragon> and the bananas pointed at the melons in the grocery papers are suggstive too
<Razyn> gummy, how do you manage to misspell Cupcakes that badly?
<NewManiac> At the Gala is best song.
<RainBroDash> 10EspyLacopa well no-one here is the kind that -does- annoy you, since they just don't know the difference. And from one person who knows to another, I'd say you should think about what the person probably means, instead of being pernickety and/or correcting them. It's alright to be helpful though :>
<RobotPinkie> naw, "Twilight is my bestest friend"
<interior_gummy> 0i could just scream
<RobotPinkie> or "you gotta share"
<HuffytheMagicDragon> ffreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnddddddddsssssssss

<Pegacorn> ARMY OF DARKNESS CRUSADERS YAY!
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, when i get about 10 or so stories written by the various authors here, I'll compile them into a single thingy and upload them somewhere. I'll probably use an edited version so that it can be more universal.

<Sol> Lovecraft, what?
<GabeMoist> I want one
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That's WHY people like her, Elky. People enjoy *giving* her a personality, wishing she was in the series more, and inevitably flipping their shit when she gets a personality in season 2 that clashes with their ideas.
<NewManiac> 4 college students on our way to an old, abandoned, cabin in the woods!
<HuffytheMagicDragon> flesh noaw thats legit

<TGPFluttershy> Alright, Random Trivia time. This movie was released in Japan on the same day the first chapter of "BERSERK" was released. As a result, Kentaro Miura was accused of copying the idea of Ash's automail. In response he claimed it was a very unusual coincidence and that he took the idea from that German knight who had an automail as well.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: 1.	The magic words "Klaatu Barada Nikto", that Ash has to speak when taking the book, were taken word-for-word from The Day the Earth Stood Still - In "The Day The Earth Stood Still" alien visitor Klaatu (Michael Rennie), utters the words to his guardian robot, Gort, to calm him when the robot blindly defends his master against humans.
<thetrollside> so what do they do when people die?
<Silverscreen> 11these Magic words that Ash said (Klaatu, Barada, Nikto) are also the names of three aliens on Jabba the Hutt's barge in Return of the Jedi
