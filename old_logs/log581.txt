<Fou_Lou> ah i see
<Ryunosuke> more feds
<Shooeie> Isnt there something above R?
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, I think I heard the F word enough for the MPAA to mandate an R rating. Then we have a huge explosion with a contrived lack of casualties.
<TheHoodyNinja> Fisheh_Fish: lol fuck that
<Ryunosuke> inb4 they are ded

<Darf14> X I think or NC-17
<pony_8487> nazi xD
<Kandarihu> It used to be X, XX, and XXX. It all got simplified to NC-17
<Fisheh_Fish> If you use the word fuck over 2-3 times, it's usually R
<crazypony> what does NC-17 mean?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> The sewage near the payphone....
<otakon> Kandarihu: um no, XXX is pornography
<Ryunosuke> ...
<owloysius> crazypony: nopony 17 or under can watch
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No children under 17.
<Fisheh_Fish> No one under 17 permitted crazypony
<otakon> Kandarihu: XX is single person pornography
<Darf14> No Children under 17
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We streamed one movie with that rating ever.
<Kandarihu> I see.
<crazypony> thx :)
<otakon> Kandarihu: X is just full nudity and implied sexual content.
<XAX> otakon: Seems fun.
<Darf14> come to think of it, I never seen a NC-17 rating in theaters
<lowfn> No children under 120
<Fisheh_Fish> I saw one Darf14
<SirGanjalf> dat German accent(foreshadowing?)
<TheHoodyNinja> otakon: you know this how?
<otakon> Darf14: it's usually stuff that is very violent.
<Fisheh_Fish> I think it was Drag Me To Hell
<otakon> TheHoodyNinja: old HBO late-night specials
<derpy_pony> in america and arabia, mere nudity is pornography
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't many theaters show NC-17.
<Hrafn> Drag Me To Hell was really funny :P

<Kandarihu> IIRC, the rule is that in order for a movie to at least have a possibility of anything less than an R rating, there must be less than 4 uses of the F word, and none of the instances being used in a sexual context.

<Eli> the other 3 are so good it hurts comparing them to the 4. one
<derpy_pony> everyone wants g3 ponies
<ponibas> HungryForChicken, just no
<Kandarihu> If we're watching Die Hard 4, and it's the worst in the movie, are we also watching Star Wars 1?
<JESmith71> What happened to the "There were only 3!" rule you guys had for Indy and Star Wars?
<Eulshy> Yes G3 ponies
<ponibas> lol, dat death
<lowfn> Why was I kicked?
<TheMaster> there is no such thing as the star wars prequels. that was a terrible, terrible nightmare
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: tarwars 1-3 is next week if im not mistaken
<ponibas> you said give u ponies or death
<Kandarihu> Fou_Lou, I see.
<Eli> no G3 ponies!
<Dark92Enigma> Gimme STAR WARS followed by Family Guy special, followed by Robot Chicken Star Wars special!
<ponibas> he kicked you and said "ded"
<FairysHuff> Kandarihu Oh god no. Not even GOD could sit through Phantom Menace and not go insane. O_o
<lowfn> :D
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: but since they dont exist. no movies next wee :-P
<Vordox> Saturn: Do you enjoy games that has alot of text?
<derpy_pony> I liked this scootaloo baby scene. Maybe we can watch it for a while
<TheMaster> instead of showing the prequels why not play the redlettermedia plinkett reviews
<red_ony> Fou_Lou: Really? If so what other series are they going to pair it with=
<Agrold> Can we have G3.5 then, if not G3?:P
<RivaLz> I wonder how much ppl would hate me if i say g3 where my favorite ponies
<lowfn> Sumica your silly.
<Fou_Lou> red_ony: robocop
<ponibas> G1 ponies are only ponies!
*lowfn dusts Sumica's toes again
<Eulshy> Fact: We will get G3 ponies if they decide to give us ponys, or worse,
<Dark92Enigma> AND this is why i never wanted to see it on 3d
<HungryForChicken> Fox news bad!
<Sumica> 00,10funny thing is it dont matter what client you use. it says why you were kicked.
<red_ony> Fou_Lou: AWESOME...well the first one is...the rest doesn't exist...
<Eulshy> Much worse than G3
<Sumica> 00,10Faux news?
<ponibas> sumi, even web client??
<FairysHuff> Sumica If star wars 1-3 is next week I'll be skipping Phantom Menace.... its sooooo bad
<Sumica> 00,10even web says why

*Surnica pokes Sumica
<TheMaster> there was only three movies.
<Vordox> Glomp = Rugby tackle with LUUUUVEEEE
<Kandarihu> Eli, 1-3 are the prequels
<Dovah> Pop quiz everypony: What is the question to the answer of life the universe and everything?
<TheMaster> There is no such thing as a star wars prequel
<XylemTube> fox news may be bad, but at least they think it's better than terrorisim
<Eli> :(
<TheMaster> 42
<Fou_Lou> Eli: no to EP1-3 original is 4-6

<TheMaster> I for one support the showing of the Plinkett Reviews of the prequels directly after showing each one
<Jim> yay, intermission
<Kandarihu> For the millionth time! FOX News isn't hating on us! It's just one little show on their network!
<Fou_Lou> timer is missing
<ponibas> i know, i was lookkingfor de kick
<lowfn> There should be an irl brony theater
<Wrek> 05fox network can die in a fire
<Eli> this is probably the best intermission i've seen in ages^^
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: was there a new thing on Fox about bronys?
<Jim> lowfn, That would be madness in a cinema
<ponibas> oi
<LadyCanary> Amen Wrek.

<Caumen> Hello there
<HungryForChicken> who was in the flame war on 4-chan?
<lowfn> I wonder if thered by any copyright issues with opening up a brony theater irl
<ponibas> jst a few
<Sumica> 00,10countless
<FairysHuff> Kandarihu That would be nice but unrealistic. The entire system is infected to it's core with the disease of corruption. You'd have to burn it all down and start again.
<ponibas> yep
<Jim> HungryForChicken, Implying there's been only one flame war on 4-chan
<Kandarihu> Fou_Lou, you must've heard about it before already. Greg Gutfeld, host of FOX News' watershed comedy show Red Eye is not too fond of us.
<lowfn> WE NEED V
<HungryForChicken> i know jim
<ponibas> Original V!!!
<HungryForChicken> hi
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: i just have seen the little thingy with a guy and a girl talking bad about bronys. is it that bit?
<Kandarihu> FairysHuff, one party is completely corrupt, and has convinced everyone that the other party is even more corrupt (even though there are good parts of it)
<lowfn> V for Vendetta... one of my favorite movies
<Conyst> wait you mean there is a time 4-chan doesn't have a flame war?
<Spectrum_Rush|> we're seeing VI today >_>
<Darf14> yes
<HungryForChicken> V for vegeta
<ponibas> i meant the series "V" but that movie is great too
<Darf14> VVVVVV
<Lil_B> ^
<FalonSquirreltamor> Darf14: great game^^
*ponibas remembers the 5th of Novemeber
<FairysHuff> Kandarihu I'll believe that when politicians stop taking bribes from big business.

<Spectrum_Rush|> Sumica: ya forgot start
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: lol. was there more than on instance with Fox news and bad brony press?
<FairysHuff> This music is making me want to play Ghost in the Shell on my PS2

<Alpha-Omega> Totally random but Gameloft is making a My Little Pony game for IOS devices and Android phones
<Kandarihu> Fou_Lou, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if Greg Gutfeld were compelled to revisit us since we took it so personally.
<Ponies47> Hye Pudge :)

<Meanwhile> Sumica: How come the old intermission is up?
<Ryunosuke> nope sumica
<Pudge> Oh are we back to using the old intermission?
<Kandarihu> FairysHuff, one such good politician pretty much killed a treaty that would've given control of the oceans to the U.N.
<Starchaser> dammit sumica
<HungryForChicken> ponibas: ?
<Kandarihu> Sumica, good one.
<Alpha-Omega> That is all I need to say goodbye

<Ryunosuke> all those client closures
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: ok i see then were probably talking both over the same instance. Talk bad about us -> get Shitstorm. Talk justified-> get a nice drawing of you as a pony ^-^
<Kandarihu> It causes the bowser to go back one step in it's history!
<ponibas> HungryForChicken, you linked a youtube vid.. dats a no no

*TheGreatAndPowerfulT still has equiped the Prussian Pickelhaube
<Obsidian> ArcherJoe11: No it was Derpy

<FairysHuff> Episode VI return of the Buffer ^_^
<Bronysith> so
<Ponies47> Scoot-Scootaloo: We watch Episode Six then It's a Trap :P
<Lil_B> Greedo didn't actually get shot
<Bronysith> anyother regulars getting dark souls for pc next month?
<Dovah> BUCK!
<Kandarihu> Han Shot First. If Greedo Shot First, Han would be dead.
<SlurryMoon> 3can't do anything about the buffer guys, sorry
<derpy_pony> the empire lost. it's all these ponies fault. and the liberal's.
<Dictonary> I gotta go! bye everypony!

<HungryForChicken> otakon: oh ok. thanks :D i like this one
<Conyst> Greedo never even fired
<Jim> I don't know, because GW2 is released the very next day
<Darf14> I shot first
<Obsidian> Bye Dictonary
<Sumica> 00,10i see no buffer
<SlurryMoon> 3in fact there shouldn't be a buffer

<derpy_pony> I had buffer
<lowfn> derpy_pony: And Obama's
<Dark92Enigma> SlurryMoon It's better than no movie
<Jim> and I know I WILL be busy playing that above anything else
<Calcos323> SlurryMoon: Can you lower the mst3k ponies just a little bit?
<ArcherJoe11> ponibas: Correct. I have the theory Greedo was working with Solo, since Han shoots the table and greedo smuggles himself later out and lives of his collected money.
<Obsidian> SlurryMoon: No buffer here
<FairysHuff> Sumica I'm getting lots of buffer
<Vordox> Im having tremendarous Visual lag, and sound skips
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> no money right now, also don't think i'll be able to run it also GW2 is calling me more

<FairysHuff> Good night everypony. The movie is unwatchable on my end so I think I will go beddy byes. *Hugs chat*

<Whiskra> he has the dark side inside of him!
<Ryunosuke> that slave outfit
<kirzstryfe> all it would've taken is one organized team really
<Squallken> slave outfit FTW
<kirzstryfe> with everyone else just wandering around doing whatever
<Meanwhile> That's all it takes in most PvP tbh.
<LadyCanary> The original cosplayer.
*Dark92Enigma will buy a slave outfit soon
*Spectrum_Rush| POMF
<Meanwhile> It's when you get two teams against each other that stuff gets fun.
<Darf14> He is now a LV85 Jedi
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No maid outfit?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat wakeup
<FouLou> Darf14: hes a sith
<Darf14> oh SNAP :O
<Eulshy> His face
<Lil_B> FouLou I wish I were in a bigger city, I would have done Computer science as well, but chemistry isn't bad eather
<Pudge> Luke lukes like a sith lord
<Pudge> looks*
<Lil_B> FouLou how long did you study?
<Dark92Enigma> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN
<Jim> What is really neat, is that WvW will be ranked, like a tournament-ish, so the winning teams will fight winning teams
<FouLou> Lil_B: long enough...
<Jim> therefore, all the good servers will fight other good servers
<otakon> .... goddammit it figures
<Meanwhile> That's clever.
<Lil_B> FouLou oh Oo
<Darf14> He activated Jabas Trap Card
*Dark92Enigma jaawa aaakwa haiigi waikkki nipple pinchy
<Dark92Enigma> lol
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damn buffer
<Zanon> hes with thrall
<otakon> I don't know if it's Slurry's connection, my connection or the movies themselves but EVERY Star Wars movie has been nothing but lag for me.
<Pudge> not the rancor pit
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S ANOTHER TRAP
<SlurryMoon> 3it's not my connection guys
<Meanwhile> Also, need to set it up so everyone on here plays the same server.
<Eulshy> RANCOR!
<SlurryMoon> 3it's mips today
<FouLou> Lil_B: im happy when its over and im finally done.
<otakon> SlurryMoon: it only happens when you stream though.
<Bronysith> Sumica: what are you doing in the movie?
<Jim> indeed
<Calcos323> I'm having little trouble
<Pudge> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<Kandarihu> I was sure Luke was ready for the trap door
<JESmith71> Sumica said that there's Mips issues
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat monster
<SlurryMoon> 3a lot more peole are telling me that they have buffer issues
<Lil_B> I have zero buffer and I have crappy connection too :(
<Jim> A neat feature they have, is guesting
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica is a Rancor?
<MaidWhite> Cute!
<Pudge> SlurryMoon: So it's on other mips channels as well?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah as i said, refresh a bit and it clears up
<Ryunosuke> nom nom nom
<Lil_B> FouLou who isn't :P
<Jim> so if a friend of your play on another server, he could play on your server, as a guest
<Vordox> I'm having all the issues. :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mmm. Pork.
<Calcos323> Those squeals that the pig does are horrifying
<Darf14> Hes hungry for bacon
<otakon> SlurryMoon: sorry, I'm not trying to complain it just happens. I'll stop.
<Eulshy> It's a good fing i've seen this movie, i can just peice shit together
<Lil_B> Vordox chacke the Computer
<Whiskra> now for the dessert
<FouLou> Lil_B: lol
<kirzstryfe> smart
<SlurryMoon> 3but I don't think there's anything I can do
<ponibas> sumi, ive refreshed like 8 yimes
<Jim> He can do everything that you'd normaly do, except use the tradingpost I guess, also no WvW
<Vordox> Lil_B: I'm an educated IT Personal with heavy focus on hardware and Software, and internal Windows Coding and program knowledge
<Lil_B> shacke*
<Vordox> It ain't my computer :P
<SlurryMoon> 3I live in Texas, if you don't live near enough to me and have a bad internet, that may be the problem
<kirzstryfe> considering they've had 5+ years to plan and polish, it's going to come out very well I think
<Dark92Enigma> Calco323 not as annoying as Willy's whinning from ''Free Willy''
<otakon> SlurryMoon: makes enough sense
<Lil_B> Vordox shacke Yourself
<Pudge> screen shotted that
<Calcos323> Dark92Enigma: True dat
<Conyst> No Luke use the door
<Sumica> 00,10it's hit or miss ponibas
<Dark92Enigma> No Luke.....use the back door
<Sumica> 00,10I refreshed 5 times and it's fine now.
<Dark92Enigma> No Luke......use the trap door
<Whiskra> Luke used Rock Throw!
<ArcherJoe11> Not The Rancor!!
<Ryunosuke> he ded
<Whiskra> its super effective
<noname> ded
<Bronysith> nooooooo Sumica is ded
<Dark92Enigma> No Luke.......IT'S A TRAP
<Darf14> KO
<pony_9154> Pffft use the force silly
<Eulshy> Luke uses Rock Throw
<SlurryMoon> 3That's coming from Sumica, who never gets issues
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Impaled.
<Pudge> I've played online with people in austrailia and didnt have issues
<SlurryMoon> 3today, mips is having trouble obviously
<derpy_pony> poor little guy...
<Lil_B> Vordox or shake your Cable provider
<kirzstryfe> still not sure which server I want to set up on though, will wait to see the final list
<Darf14> :'(
<Vordox> Diss random scene
<Vordox> :D
<derpy_pony> :(
<Lil_B> all the Emotions
<Bronysith> Sumica: why u have giant door impaled in you?
<xboxedd> poor fat guy
<ArcherJoe11> I feel sad for the beasttrainer and his rancor.
<Conyst> His only friend is dead
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's Chief Manboobs.
*ponibas refreshes 10th time
<Obsidian> It was his best friend
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol
<Whiskra> oh my dear little murder monster... woe is me :(

<Sumica> 00,10my back itched

<Calcos323> Poor Fluttershy-man...
<Bronysith> Sumica: what would dick jensen use...
<Vordox> 1 refresh = Stream not working. :P at all
<Eulshy> That bad huh
<Jim> mhm
<Conyst> Together again for the first time
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, dumpster
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: Dick Jensen's Rod.
<derpy_pony> just shoot them in the face
<Jim> I'm thinking of playing on The Far Shiverpeaks, because my brother will be playing there
<Lil_B> Vordox Blame flash... because Flash is garbage :P
<Meanwhile> All powerful? It's a big thing in the ground. It doesn't even move.
<Sumica> 00,10kill every one and loot all things Bronysith
<Dark92Enigma> Conyst In years
<Darf14> 1,000 years of digesion, plenty of time to escape
<twilight_sprinkle> Luke needs to work on his speech
<eleanorawesome> He will suffocate before 1000 years
<Lil_B> ohai Phase4
<Dark92Enigma> Kill manboobs.....then he will join him
<ponibas> I jumped in a sarlac pit ones..
<Dark92Enigma> WAIT WHAT?
<Darf14> R2D2 is now a bar
<ponibas> once* .. wow
<Sumica> 00,10If jaba realy wanted to torture them he would make them go colect the two datacrons .
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rockin' blue elephant.
<Pudge> you'd die of hunger before 1000 years are up
<twilight_sprinkle> ponibas: and howd it go?
<Whiskra> I don't want to imagine the smell of the waste resulted from 1000 year old food...
<Bronysith> Sumica: you played TOR?
<Dark92Enigma> wOW i have issues
<ponibas> omg.. those datacrons succkkkeeddd
<Eulshy> Sumica, lol
<Dark92Enigma> lol
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Sumica: that game, never again
<Sumica> 00,10Yeah
<eleanorawesome> lol that too
<derpy_pony> indiana jones
<ponibas> I fell to my death.. i got to respawn :p
<Lil_B> I loved the Blue elephant Games on newgrounds
<Bronysith> Sumica: i played it for a while...then i got hooked on ponies
<twilight_sprinkle> Pudge: maybe youre fed a bit by the sarlacc
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> servers make any diference aside from the people playing there ?
<ponibas> PaladinDrakkenwolf, you played TOR?
<Kandarihu> 2 Datacrons, what's that a reference to?
<Conyst> Soon he shall see a big blur blur
<twilight_sprinkle> ponibas: lol you mean in force unleashed?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ponibas: yeah for barely a month before quiting
<kirzstryfe> have one set Euro and one set NA
<ponibas> Kandarihu, Star Wars: The Old Republic
*Dark92Enigma this is MY HOMELAND, motherbucker
<Kandarihu> Ah, okay
<Dark92Enigma> lol
<Jim> Well, there will obviously be a difference in the World vs World thingy
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> giant anus in the desert
<derpy_pony> pirate execution
<owloysius> familiar
<ponibas> twilight_sprinkle, nah, TOR
<eleanorawesome> yummy
<Bronysith> Sumica: actually watched ponies for the first time whilst downloading TOR on my new pc. I had a maxed out assassin loved it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I thought it a Force Unleashed reference (though there was no Tatooine level in FU).
<Wrek> 05that creature must swallow one hell of a lot of sand
<Jim> Also, some servers may have higher populations than other
<Mandelbrony> why does that thing need teeth?
<kirzstryfe> and then there'd be a ping difference depending on where the actual servers are, but aside from those 3 things, not really
<twilight_sprinkle> ponibas: ah cool. do you like Tor?
<Dark92Enigma> MEG? is that you?
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<Meanwhile> Oh yeah ofc, EU and NA servers.
<ponibas> PaladinDrakkenwolf, my subs still active, but I only log in like once every couple weeks
<Eulshy> Those teeth, they don't look like their very well positioned
*Dark92Enigma ba dum tss
<lowfn> I like that thing shes wearing for some strange reason... Hmmm I wonder why... ;)
<ponibas> twilight_sprinkle, I do, but none of my friends play anymore.. lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: there was a fight vs boba fett on tatooine, at least on the psp version, it had a sarlacc
<Jim> A person playing on a EU server could guest to a NA server
<Jim> so it'd be fine
<Conyst> Nittany_Discord: there was if you kill vader in the first game
<Squallken> Pay back time :)
<Mandelbrony> jabbas boned
*Eulshy Nods
<Meanwhile> Oh that's cool.
<Mandelbrony> jabbas boner
<twilight_sprinkle> ponibas: they got tired of it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll have to go back to FU.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Been a while since I played it.
<Lil_B> wow... I had exactly oine Lego-Model of a Ship as a kid, and its the one Luke is standing on right now... I didn't even knew what Starwars was back then -.-
<twilight_sprinkle> ker-spin!
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: force unleashed?
<Darf14> there now ******
<Kandarihu> WILHELM SCREAM

<Meanwhile> Wilhelm.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> woot
<Calcos323> WILHELM
<ponibas> twilight_sprinkle, kinda started when no one could decide on a side to play..
<Dark92Enigma> WILHELM SCREAM
<Eulshy> damit, buffer
<red_ony> they really should have handcuffed him...
<Sumica> 00,10nooooooo not wukhelm
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: ahh. you mean god of war with lightsabers...
<red_ony> now look at the mess
<Mandelbrony> what as wilhelm named after?
<lowfn> I love how we are obssesing over the Wilhelm Scream
<kirzstryfe> I think my main toon will be an Ele though
<Pudge> Boba nooooo
<Squallken> bye bye
<Dark92Enigma> BOBBA NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<FouLou> lowfn: once you know it you can never overhear one
<Jim> I will play a guardian
<twilight_sprinkle> ponibas: kk, im just curious if a friend of mine should try it
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Boba Fett, away!
<Ryunosuke> whump
<Bronysith> BURRRRRRP
<Obsidian> fail
<StinkomanFan> RIP Boba Fett, he died before we knew him

<owloysius> om nom nom
<Conyst> no Boba don't go!
<Fisheh_Fish> Ded
<noname> fail
<Darf14> Nooo Boba! ..... RIP :(
<Kandarihu> Go Leia!
<Sumica> 00,10what a cheap death for such a cool guy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Into the pit you go.
<Pudge> Boba es ded
<twilight_sprinkle> he diddnt die
<Meanwhile> Whatever the tank class is. I've had enough of rogueing.
<Bronysith> ill play it
<ponibas> twilight_sprinkle, no harm in trying.. It's free up to level 15 now
<Jim> There is no tank
<Lil_B> I never noticed that Boba just got killed by exident...
<kirzstryfe> didn't try that, but I've never really liked melee classes
*Dark92Enigma Bobba Fett: ''I'll be back on the Robot Chicken STAR WARS special''
<Jim> There is no healers
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ANOTHER WILHELM
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat tongue
<Jim> There is no dps
<lowfn> red_ony was*
<Bronysith> we playing on EU servers or American servers?
<ArcherJoe11> StinkomanFan: Boba lifes. He appears in Jedi Academy!!
<Conyst> No Boba lives
<twilight_sprinkle> Boba didnt die, altho hes not shown again in the movie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well so far i only played necromancer
<kirzstryfe> that's the great thing about it, you're you, heal your own damn self :3
<derpy_pony> kinky
<lowfn> WILHELM
<ponibas> omg.. spoilers!
<Whiskra> And people think Derpy is an overrated character among fans... Boba Fett had only a few minutes of screentime then died
<Meanwhile> Oh that's right Guild Wars did weird things with it's classes.
<Lil_B> whats the Whilhelm scream?
<Eulshy> he escapes digestion
<Jim> I find it quite awesome
<twilight_sprinkle> ponibas: yeah but the question is whether itll get old eventually, wouldnt wanna waste money for nothing
<Meanwhile> I think my brief stint of the original consisted of being an Assassinrangermage.
<Pudge> i see no spoilers
<kirzstryfe> really funny when the giant dragon turns to 1shot the clothy standing too close :3
<StinkomanFan> LANDO NO
<owloysius> nah... applejack is overrated. She has one appearance in the pilot ans gets so many fans.
<Darf14> Its having one heck of a buffet
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> rape
<kirzstryfe> I played Ranger for most of the original
<ponibas> pudge, not movie wise.. but story line wise
<Pudge> NOOOO LANDO
<Sumica> 00,10these gunners must suck at lootship.
<twilight_sprinkle> Whiskra: he did get some screen time in the prequels tho
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B listen to an overused scream in this movie that goes like this AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaahhhh!
<FouLou> Lil_B: look it up at wikipedia. its a wiedly used scream. its even used in todays movies
<owloysius> she took over the derpy episode with a ridiculous side story
<Fisheh_Fish> LANDO :'(
<ponibas> lootship.. lol
<Eulshy> skip, skip, skip, palys for 3 secs, buffer repeat
<Darf14> No Lando!
<kirzstryfe> will likely have an Ele, then either an Engi or Ranger
<ponibas> "I'm on a boat!"
<Bronysith> if i get guild wars 2
<otakon> ouchie!
<Lil_B> FouLou: Dark92Enigma thanks
<Bronysith> i am going with what i know best
<otakon> He just wanted a friend!
<Bronysith> heavy melee
<lowfn> I wonder if someone has a fetish for Jabba the Hutt
<Jim> The classes are Ranger, Elementalist, Necromancer, Mesmer, Guardian, Engineer, Warrior
<twilight_sprinkle> no the imps, his eyes!
<otakon> poor Sarlacc
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B hold on: i'll give you a link
<Conyst> trust me I can't see
<Jim> Did I forget something?
<Wrek> 05i can guarantee it
<Pudge> lowfn: That's...disturbing
<otakon> lowfn: sadly probably so
<Jim> Thief
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01lowfn: I'm sure someone does.
<Mandelbrony> i do
<otakon> MY MECHANO HAND!
<Bronysith> well
<lowfn> Thats humans for ya
<Wrek> 05everything has a fetish for it
<twilight_sprinkle> kerpush
<Bronysith> warrior it is then
<Wrek> 05atleast 1 person in the world
<Kandarihu> Derpy had a few seconds of screen time in every cameo she had over 52 episodes. Boba Fett had a story-relavent role in several continual minutes in about 6 hours of movie time.
<Darf14> I think someone out there does lowfn
<twilight_sprinkle> r34
<StinkomanFan> I like big women but not JABBA big
<Wrek> 05guaranteed
*ponibas has earned the achievement "I'm on a boat (10 man)"
<Bronysith> anything where i get a giant ass sword
<Bronysith> or something
<Meanwhile> Does GW2 have the same kind of mixed-class mechanic that GW has?
<derpy_pony> lowfn: if it exists...
*Bronysith megusta face
<Mandelbrony> tentacle rape and slug combined into one
<Sumica> 00,10waht is that rope tied to?
*Dark92Enigma is about to get banned
<otakon> Kandarihu: so it works out about the same?
<Jim> It doesn't
<Fisheh_Fish> StinkomanFan: Fat bottom girls make the rockin world go round
<kirzstryfe> it's more based on your weapons
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: don't do it!
<Jim> You play one class, that's it
<Conyst> I can fly wait no I can't
<twilight_sprinkle> ponibas: pffft, not even heroid? laaame
<allponiesarebestponi> hey hey hey
<Lil_B> Wrek well, that the second definition of r34, everthing canm be considered a fetish
<Kandarihu> otakon, yeah
<kirzstryfe> each weapon has skills associated with it
<twilight_sprinkle> *heroic
<Jim> your skills are based of which combinations of weapons you use
<XylemTube> lol he ded
<Spectrum_Rush|> Sumica: plot
<Zawan> that reminds me have they chopped off any hands yet?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They blow up over the sarlac?
<Obsidian> Noooooo. Max Reebo!
<Pudge> well i guess jabba just gives you more cushion for the pushin
<Dark92Enigma> otakon ok i won't........i just have another idea
<ponibas> twilight_sprinkle, we... were in a guild that tried to be both hardcore raiding nad "family style"
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Starwars? :D
<Jim> So if you equip a sword for mainhand, you get three skills associated to the sword
<Mandelbrony> where was the millenium falcon kept all this time?
<Bronysith> well
<Dark92Enigma> DAT SOUND QUALITY
<Bronysith> cant wait to try it
<lowfn> Zawan: Eeenope
<RAWRity> Bonjour
<Jim> then there are two skills that's associated to what you equip for offhand
<ponibas> twilight_sprinkle, it didn't work for kicking people out of raids who didn't pay attention or come prepared
<Lil_B> Aloa RAWRity
<allponiesarebestponi> soo we watching ponies watch star wars
<Sumica> 00,10good thing he had that gloce just siting there

*Dark92Enigma Why do we need Bea Arthur?............................SILENCE!
<LadyCanary> RAWRity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Pudge> John Williams everypony
<Obsidian> I like this music
<Jim> But if you equip, say a 2 hander sword on a guardian, you get a different skillset than you would have gotten on a warrior
<LadyCanary> :D
<allponiesarebestponi> this song says we are the bad guys
<Conyst> hello RAWRity
<Calcos323> RAWRity getting more hello pings than I ever have
<RAWRity> Mandelbrony: Vader lost everything but his right hand, actually
<Bronysith> ahh
<twilight_sprinkle> John Williams ftw
<Bronysith> sounds interesting
<RAWRity> LadyCanary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
<lowfn> Why is Pinkie bowing to that guy
<LadyCanary> ^^
<RAWRity> I had a terrible day!
<Bronysith> but
<Dark92Enigma> SIR John Williams everypony
<Bronysith> dark souls is going to have my attention
<JESmith71> The songs says "Here comes Darth Vader walkin' through the door, he kicked Luke Skywalker 'cross the floor"
<Bronysith> with it being hard
<kirzstryfe> Ele has one of the most convoluted weapon sets though >.<
<Conyst> It's Darth Twilight
<Mandelbrony> RAWRity, i meant luke. vader cut his hand off?
<RAWRity> Mandelbrony: yes.
<twilight_sprinkle> dat laugh
<lowfn> No Twilight is Leiah

<Zawan> at the end dosent he lose 5 limbs total?
<allponiesarebestponi> glad to be back after 4 hours
<lowfn> And fluttershy is Yoda
<Mandelbrony> imagine yoda and pinkie pie hangin out
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damn buffer
<Jim> I found it kind of complex, because of all these elementals you swap between
<Whiskra> yoda
<Wrek> 05SlurryMoon: will there be more family guy after this? :3
<allponiesarebestponi> yoda it is
<Dark92Enigma> JESmith So, Much WIN
<SlurryMoon> 3yes, of course
<kirzstryfe> yeah, and you have to level out each set per element
<RAWRity> Today I got to spend 8 hours driving back and forth across town and waiting in long lines, just so I can be sure I can actually pay for school.
<SlurryMoon> 3and I have the torrent
<Wrek> 05yeeeey!
<Squallken> and yoda just justs sick
<Conyst> No you're not old at all.

<SlurryMoon> 3so it will be a quick transition
<owloysius> yay
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> 900 years old
<Fisheh_Fish> Lol
<Jim> Do you have to do that for every weapon
<lowfn> Yoda is 900?
<Jim> I didn't try the ele that far
<Darf14> Hes almost as old as the Doctor
<Dark92Enigma> OVER.......900 years old
<ZappyTheUnicorn> 900 years old....wow.
<kirzstryfe> yep
<Mandelbrony> does yoda know luke is vader's son?
<allponiesarebestponi> yeeeey who said that
<Conyst> He's 900 years young.
<Dark92Enigma> D'aaaaaaaw
<Jim> oh my
<Whiskra> I think Yoda really is an amazing puppet... so well done
<lowfn> Darf14: I was going to say that :(
<Jim> Lenghty process I'd believe
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Twilight
<otakon> RAWRity: well at least it's done and you can watch the stream. My net seems to be fighting with Slurry's net atm I can't watch worth a damn.

<Wrek> 05the force has kept him alive untill he has performed his final task
<Reactor> "Twilight is upon me"
<Darf14> sorry lowfn :(
<twilight_sprinkle> he wants to dream of Twi
<Wrek> 05to make sure luke has a chance agaisnt the sith lord
<Meanwhile> Probably to encourage thinking hard about what you want to do.
<Reactor> Get her off then!
<allponiesarebestponi> oh god twilight why you kill yoda
<twilight_sprinkle> i hope he isnt talking about the vampire stories
<kirzstryfe> so 15 skills between all of the weapons, times 4 elements
<Vordox> Wrek: Scumbag force.
<TehBrony> NO YODA
<lowfn> Hes almost as old as The Doctor
<Conyst> Run from those movies Yoda!
<lowfn> :$
<Jim> I just stuck to my greatsword and sceptre and shield on my guardian
<Darf14> Yoda will live on in spirit
<twilight_sprinkle> lolno you aint
<RAWRity> otakon: I don't know, my stream seems to be jerking around too. This green guy's lines keep coming out as gibberish.
<StinkomanFan> VADER
<Mandelbrony> does yoda know luke is vader's son?
<otakon> RAWRity: -__-
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> only have an axe and a dagger :p
<kirzstryfe> yeah, people will tend to pick a set they like and stay with it
<Obsidian> Mandelbrony: Yes

<Mandelbrony> oh lulz, nvm
<twilight_sprinkle> Mandelbrony: yes, he was told at the end of 5th
<otakon> Mandelbrony: um that was the HUGE climax at the end of Empire.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dunnnnnnn
<kirzstryfe> not sure how necro will play, it seems they completely reworked the class
<Conyst> Of course Yoda knows he knows all except proper grammar
<Calcos323> cHAT DERP
<RAWRity> otakon: know, he's asking of YODA knew
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i wonder if it could be called the biggest climax of cinema history
<LadyCanary> No kissy face, RAWRity. Sad faec

<Lil_B> C3POs Face reminds of the machine -Human in Metropolis
<Kandarihu> That's no moon, it's a GANMEN!
<JESmith> Mandelbrony watch Sonic Adventure 2 then if you want to see a moon blow up
<Eddmario> Random fact: They didn't know if Harrison Ford was gonna play Han Solo again, so they froze him in Empire
<Squallken> not your mom
<CriticKitten> She was also a bit whiny
<kirzstryfe> there will probably be one
<Ponies47> MORE Computer derps! :[

<Dark92Enigma-RED> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Jim> I'm gonna try to get ingame as fast as possible and reserve Celestia or Luna
<Jim> or the lulz
<Dark92Enigma-RED> (just quoting the line)
*Fisheh_Fish eats popsicle
<kirzstryfe> if you have the first game, if you make a character with the name it reserves it
<kirzstryfe> for the first 24h after launch
<otakon> um
<Darf14> huh offline?
<Dark92Enigma-RED> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
<Eddmario> What if a dude dated, married, and had kids with some chick, and he eventually found out she was his long lost sister?
<otakon> the broadcast is offline for me
<Mandelbrony> shit dood, mindbuck
<otakon> Eddmario: someone did
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> inb4 servers overload can't access for 3 days
<Eddmario> otakon: Refresh
<CriticKitten> But she ends up sucking at the Force :D
<otakon> Eddmario: it was weird
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> :p
<Dark92Enigma-RED> You're crazy!
<Darf14> THere we go, just hit the play button
<Dark92Enigma-RED> lol
<Meanwhile> "Oh really because at first I thought you meant C3PO"
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> otakon: xD
<Mandelbrony> incest? incest
<PsychoticDoc> this stream service is just aweful
<Jim> Well, since you had to have two word or more names in GW, nobody has one word names reserved
<Obsidian> Even when you kissed him?
<Eddmario> otakon: Really? I remember hearing about someone who didn't know his wife was a dude for almost their entire marriage
<Dark92Enigma-RED> (pause for dramatic effect........) DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
<Meanwhile> Oh yeah, I liked that.
<HungryForChicken> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEICE OF SHI- i..i..i mean the stream
<otakon> Eddmario: well there was another where the guy was related.
<Meanwhile> Actual naming convention instead of "Macgooberfour"
<Dark92Enigma-RED> And my mother knew it........
<Kandarihu> We have two refresh buttons right now. The button on Veemi, the button on Bronystate, and those of us who use external IRC clients can safely use the button on our browsers.
<otakon> HungryForChicken: refresh
<Obsidian> HungryForChicken: Refresh
<Squallken> sick
<otakon> not like it matters
<kirzstryfe> I think they've planned for that actually TheGreatAndPowerfulT :p
<allponiesarebestpony> there i had to use a new name
<otakon> bc goddammit STILL LAGGIN
<Mandelbrony> is there a 'shit' equivalent for ponies?
<Lil_B> http://i.imgur.com/4pTOp.png
<Eddmario> Press the big blue button that says "Refresh" under the stream
<HungryForChicken> oh.. thanks otakon
<Jim> Guild wars names have always been quite more on the role play side
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> diablo try to plan for it :p it did not work
<Dark92Enigma-RED> Mandelbrony: Shoot
<WalkerPony89> otakon: It's smoothed out for me FYI
<SirGanjalf> Mandelbrony: or hay
<Obsidian> Lil_B: lol
<owloysius> fun fact: the blue button and f5 do the same thing thanks to javascript
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Lil_B: :D
<otakon> WalkerPony89: yeah it's still lagtastic
*kirzstryfe has more faith in ArenaNet than Blizzard at this point
<Jim> ^
<Meanwhile> ^^
<otakon> for me anyway but hey, it's always just me
<Zawan> Lil_B: danm that was fast
<Eddmario> Random bit of trivia: Harrison Ford HATED Han Solo
*Dark92Enigma-RED i feel sexfual attractiher toward my brot
<Kandarihu> owloysius, F5 is a bad idea for anyone using an embedded client.
<Mandelbrony> do they say 'bucking' in the show?
<allponiesarebestpony> why is my original name not working
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehhh probably you are right
<BlazeAngel> Hi everypony.
<Obsidian> Hello BlazeAngel
<Eddmario> Mandelbrony: Only when referring to AJ's job.
<kirzstryfe> considering they halved the number of servers from the first 2 beta weekends, upped the number of players, and still had no major issues?
<owloysius> i know.
<Lil_B> Zawan I see no reason why it should have taken long :/
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ATAT
*Dark92Enigma-RED I feel sexual atrractions toward my brother (fuck my keyboard)
<Fisheh_Fish> yo BlazeAngel
<Mandelbrony> Eddmario, they need to change that
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> question ? do the character i made last week stays or i have to make another ?
<CriticKitten> Oh hey look
<kirzstryfe> have to start over for the launch
<Dark92Enigma-RED> WAS THAT SO HARD TO SAY
<Dark92Enigma-RED> ?
<CriticKitten> An even LESS practical place to use an ATAT
<Jim> You must start from scratch
<Eddmario> Dark92Enigma-RED: I'd see a therapist for that...
<kirzstryfe> that's the usual way of betas though
<Zawan> Lil_B: its just that was your first reaction
<Mandelbrony> shit dood
<Calcos323> Dat mole on his face
<BlazeAngel> Hey, kirzstryfe, you there?
<SirGanjalf> shoot did
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He had a rod.
<Dark92Enigma-RED> Eddmario I'm mocking Leia, bro
<owloysius> Dark92Enigma-RED: I'm not really into keyboards
<Kandarihu> allponiesarebestpony, wait for your nick to time out. Then you can switch back to it.
<Jim> I had a level 55 guardian after the second beta weekend
<Eddmario> Dark92Enigma-RED: *that's the joke*
<StinkomanFan> Also, impound his ship
<Meanwhile> What's the max level?
<kirzstryfe> they wiped the server I played on the first weekend >.<
<Jim> 80
<Meanwhile> Gutted kirz.
<allponiesarebestpony> thanks Kandarihu ill just use the for now
<XylemTube> Point lightsaber Directly at son's face
<Dark92Enigma-RED> owloysius i was mocking Leia, btw
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I miss when this was cool before the prequels.
<owloysius> i know
<Eddmario> ...The stream lag is just messing with us, picking the most hilarious moments to pause at
<Pudge> Vader isnt such a bad dude
<Lil_B> So son... lets repeat all the Father-Son Activitys we couldn't do over the last 20 years
<Obsidian> Um yeah...... lets not bring up the past. Too many bad prequels.
<kirzstryfe> wasn't too bad though, was only in mid-20s I think, was enjoying it and not trying to power level
<Jim> A neat thing is, there is almost no level curves
<kirzstryfe> and I had work
<Jim> so every level takes about the same amount of gameplay
<Dark92Enigma-RED> FINAL BATTLE INCOMING......
<allponiesarebestpony> jar jar
<kirzstryfe> and there's not much dead time with all of the side stuff going on
<Pudge> EPICNESS INCOMING
<PsychoticDoc> why does everyone hate the prequels?
<SirGanjalf> DA POWAH
<kirzstryfe> can just play and have fun, then hit level before you even realize it
<Eddmario> Obsidian: Unless you're counting the newer Clone Wars as well, then there was only 1 bad prequal *cough*Attack of the Clones*cough*
<allponiesarebestpony> JAR JAR
<Jim> I got to level 15 in PvE
<Reactor> PsychoticDoc: Most think they aren't as good as the old ones.
<Jim> then I ONLY did WvW after that
<Kandarihu> PsychoticDoc, two words. One of them is Jar and the other is Jar
<PsychoticDoc> they are all good in there own way people can just chill
<SirGanjalf> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4O5ePAq4nVU/SXtt7xUA5GI/AAAAAAAAA8s/ooaEh3b9I3A/s320/dark+side.jpg
<Pudge> I mean come on people, you cant beat the pod racing scene from ep 1
<Pudge> can you?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jar Jar gave Palpatine complete control of the republic.
<Obsidian> Kandarihu: Dont forget the "midichorians"
<Jim> It's a real cool thing, that you could actually level from 1 to 80 solely from playing PvP if that's what you like
<Meanwhile> Does PvP grant xp?
<Jim> yes
<FouLou> SirGanjalf: probaly made of ewoks
<Eddmario> Pudge: Don't forget the epic battle at the end too!
<Lil_B> Episode 1 is still the only Star Wars Movie I own
<Fisheh_Fish> ^
<Meanwhile> I always hated PvP in WoW.
<GabeMoist> Everything is Jar Jar's fault
<Jim> And Everyone is bumped up to max level to make it more fair
<Eddmario> Here comes the scene where Han cops a feel
<Jim> The PvP in GW is awesome
<Pudge> Eddmario: that was good too. I mean really if you get past Jar Jar it's a solid movie
<Darf14> Theres always a back door
<JESmith> Pudge aside from the bad announcer commentary
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so can we blame Jar Jar and not me? >.>
<Calcos323> Secret entrance fun
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Secret.
<kirzstryfe> it's always been max level, difference is skills and skill
<Mandelbrony> 'secret'
<owloysius> back door fun
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SaxyPretender: Maybe.
<Meanwhile> It looks it. I think the objectives is what makes PvP fun. WoW PvP is too small.
<Darf14> Its a Secret for everybodu
<WalkerPony89> A "secret entrance"
<Pudge> We all hate Navi from OOT and that game is still considered the best game
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Scret Back Door Fun
<WalkerPony89> Giggity
<SirGanjalf> FouLou: Good, because Wookies are a bit CHEWY
<Darf14> *body*
<Ponies47> I hate my computer -_-

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spanish alien?
<WalkerPony89> Wrek: I beat ya to it
<Lil_B> Pudge I never minded Navi, that fucking Owl is what sucks
<Darf14> That tingling sensation..... I smell a Meme :O
<StinkomanFan> OH CRAP
<Gaston> its a trap
<PinkiePieYoshi64> OMG, JUST IN TIME FOR THE BATTLE Endor Battle :D
<owloysius> Pudge: hey! hey! listen! watch out! listen!
<kirzstryfe> is the nice thing with GW, most of the gear difference is purely aesthetic
<SirGanjalf> Admiral Ackbar is best admiral
<Meanwhile> Back in the day AV could go on for hours.
<Calcos323> Wrek: I already got it typed in so I can be ready
<WalkerPony89> Wrek: To the inb4 I mean :P

<Gaston> its a lap
<Gaston> dance
<owloysius> it's a map!

<Darf14> Meme spam incoming! Get in your nearest spam shelter!
<Meanwhile> Collecting bits off dead players to turn in for npc buffs and the like.
<Mandelbrony> its a fap
<Calcos323> It's a fap!
<otakon> it's a cap!
<Eddmario> Pudge: People don't realize Jar Jar fills the same role in the prequals as R2D2 and C3PO did in the original trilogy: Comedy
<JESmith71> Pudge, the podracing would have been better without that stupid announcer
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> its a slap
<Calcos323> Mandlebrony: ninja'd
<Lil_B> It's A Wrap! Thats Right A Tasty wrap with fresh Ingridiences, only here!
<crazypony> it's a tap
<Meanwhile> Where it took some actual effort to capture a tower.
<Shizuka> 13oh look, teddy bears
<WalkerPony89> Wrek: I didn't think it was neccesary. Everyone should known what I meant by "trap"
<ZappyTheUnicorn> It's a tarp.

<Eddmario> otakon: That's why he's hilarious!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Shizuka *hugs*
<Barbetos> Shizuka don't take one home, they smell like rotten cabbage
<Darf14> Stop that teddy bear
<Meanwhile> Now everyone steamrolls across the map and picks everything up on the way. The most tactics you get are a couple of people defending a flag. And then getting crunched.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Shizuka.
<Mandelbrony> everyone! after him!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Stop it's Ted again!
<SirGanjalf> It's a trapezoid! http://www.film.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/zoidberg.jpeg
<otakon> Eddmario: no he's practically a goddamn stereotype.
<FouLou> Eddmario: problem is c2po and r2 exist in the prequels. thus rendering jar jar obsolete
<owloysius> this isn't exciting enough
<owloysius> they need to play card games
<Shizuka> 13careful men don't go past the blue screens
<Eulshy> WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> barrrel roll
<Lil_B> I would have loved to see this guy taking off his helmet and throwing it onto the ground in anger
<Mandelbrony> snap his neck
<Ryunosuke> that oldest trick
<Darf14> :D
<Meanwhile> Welp.
<Obsidian> lol
<ZappyTheUnicorn> :D
<JESmith71> FouLou espically since R2 is a Swiss Army Knife in the prequels
<Calcos323> What a dumbass
<allponiesarebestpony> really

<SirGanjalf> LEEEEERROOOO-ah, nv,
<FouLou> JESmith71: LOL
<SirGanjalf> *nvm
<Mandelbrony> that base was really small in battlefront 1
<Eddmario> The only difference between the VHS and the DVD releases of Jedi is the ghost of Anakin at the end...
<Shizuka> 13star wars 6, early proof lucas was going insane and should no longer have been allowed near scripts
<Wrek> 05i bet they would keep the small vent tube in the new design aswell
<Eddmario> Well, that's all I noticed anywhere
<Meanwhile> Destroy the Death Star. And then Destroy it again.
<otakon> Shizuka: why do you say that?
<kidzrul434> bronies I have a confession to make
<Calcos323> Shizuka: Huh?
<Meanwhile> Can you do that? can you destroy the Death Star twice?
<otakon> kidzrul434: you don't like ponies huh?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yes kidzrul434 ?
<Obsidian> yes kidzrul434
<kidzrul434> I never really cried reading MLD but it did make me sad
<ZappyTheUnicorn> kidzrul434: What?
<SirGanjalf> Meanwhile: Death Star prooves that you CAN explode twice
<SaxyPretender> 0,14actually, there's a reason for that
<Eddmario> kidzrule434: You clop?
<Meanwhile> SirGanjalf: proves*
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> okay
<Barbetos> otakon .... empire defeated by a bunch of 3 foot bears? YOU SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS!?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01kidzrul434: So. MLD didn't phase me.
<Jim> I saw a video of 5 people sucessfuly defending a tower against 50 people in GW
<Obsidian> kidzrul434: that it?
<Pudge> kidzrul434: I didnt cry either but it still made me cried on the inside
<Calcos323> kidzrul434: No biggie, I didn't cry either. It did make me feel like shit for days, though
<Wrek> 05kidzrul434: meh, many people didnt cry whe nreading it.
<Jim> because they actualy used tactics
<Pudge> cry*
<Wrek> 05they jsut got a feel
<otakon> kidzrul434: dude I didn't cey either. you want to feel real emotions, read Fallout: Equestria
<PsychoticDoc> i listened to dead island theme and read dashie, still didnt cry
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the guy who helped with the scripts for ANH and ESB left and didn't work on RoTJ
<Meanwhile> MLD is a dull story.
<otakon> hiya SaxyPretender
<SirGanjalf> *grammar hammered* ouch
<Fisheh_Fish> I cried, cuz I'm a sucker for sad good byes
<ZappyTheUnicorn> kidzrul434: Yep. It made me depressed, but I didn't cry.
<allponiesarebestpony> i type slow and i would like to reply to some ponies
*Eddmario has not read My Little Dashie, and doesn't plan to
<Shizuka> 13sir i think you need to look into oil of olay
<otakon> Bronysith: the ST's can't hit the broadside of a spacebarn
<Calcos323> Personally, I found The Things We Leave Behind to be a FAR better sadfic
<otakon> Shizuka: it's from the lightning burns
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I should stream a match with Robcakeran again.
<JESmith71> Barbetos, I know the Ewok cartoon probably doesn't count, but the Ewok kids managed to stop the Empire before in that show as well
<Shizuka> 13someone to get that face stretching thing from star trek insurrection, he needs one
<Meanwhile> otakon: He's just uglu.

<HungryForChicken> HappySparkle: jeremy theres alot of people saying things so your gunna hae to keep looking for my name
<otakon> mitamaking: oh god really?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Darf14: Stuff them. No loss.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, that sad feel when they were supposed to have made Battlefron 3
<Kandarihu> If they get stuck in a body, they do a lot of damage to the internal organs. It's entirely possible that a Stormtrooper's uniform is made out of a material that can repel blasters or all kind of commonly used weapon. If, by the complexity of the material's design, it's useless against arrows, so be it.
<mitamaking> otakon: What I have heard
<Liokin> Dat lando
<HappySparkles> Took me Awhile to find it on My Playstation 3 :s
<otakon> mitamaking: wow that is sad.

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> SaxyPretender: ;_;
<otakon> ArcherJoe11: lol
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender: Ok, that sounds stupid.
<Darf14> They need Star Fox to help them fight
<WalkerPony89> SaxyPretender: They had some gameplay footage too, don't forget ;_;
<Shizuka> 13yeah but Kandarihu we see troopers get killed, not injured, killed, by glancing blows to an arm with that armor

<Eddmario> *heared
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm doing OKAY, ArcherJoe11. How about you?
<Spectrum_Rush|> SaxyPretender: one day...
<otakon> Shizuka: yeah I always noticed that, why have the armor it it doesn't even work to stop glancing shots?
<mitamaking> Why would killing an evil man make you evil, the jedis killed a lot in the prequels?
<Calcos323> pew
<XylemTube> He caved :(
<Kandarihu> Maybe the Stormtrooper armor is only useful against the vacuum of space, then.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn: Maybe as a mod (if it isn't copyright-blocked).
<Squallken> Tarzan Wookee :D
<Ryunosuke> that tarzan yes
<otakon> Saturn: hiya man, what's wup?
<Calcos323> mitamaking: It's because he's killing in anger

<ArcherJoe11> Not bad. Had Press visit at work today and got 2 free days now.
<Dark92Enigma-RED> Shizuka Um.......everyone in the Star Wars Universe are idiots including the fans? (sorry for asking three times)
<StinkomanFan> I want those hats
<mitamaking> Eddmario: Darth Maul
<otakon> Meanwhile: like my net?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SaxyPretender, not Saturn.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Your net doesn't even cover the hope part.
<SirGanjalf> uhm, couldn't you shot him?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Eddmario> mitamaking: They never killed him for revenge.
<Shizuka> 13and if it DOES, it's a blaster projectile with some mass (as light only would exert no lethal force) and small size traveling at extremely high velocity... if the armor blocks that but can't block an arrow traveling at many magnitudes less speed and a much larger surface area..
<Pudge> dat tab fail
<Darf14> That AT-ST is a SPY!
<Kandarihu> Poor AT-ST
<Dark92Enigma-RED> MY LEG
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dem legs
<mitamaking> Eddmario: What do you call that Obi Wan did to Maul?
<Meanwhile> otakon: In a fight between your internet and a stormtrooper, for once, the stormtrooper would win.
<Shizuka> 13like i said right around here you can see lucas going insane :3
<Mandelbrony> light still produces heat
<Eddmario> mitamaking: Killing him because Maul was a SITH?
<Pudge> insane with inspiration
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wookies liek Cookies :D
<Shizuka> 13ja but this is visible light
<Mandelbrony> lasers dont have mass, yet the can kill
<Meanwhile> Too bad he wasn't crushed by that fairground ride last week really Shizuka.
<Shizuka> 13infrared generates heat
<XylemTube> lol he ded
<mitamaking> Eddmario: Why couldn't he do it before his master was killed, he did it with anger
<Darf14> that cartoon logic
<owloysius> Ewocks really like ........ socks
<Eddmario> I wonder what does AT-STs would count as at an I-Pass area...
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Boom! Head strangle xD
<Darf14> Here comes Tom!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Infrared is hear really.
<Fisheh_Fish> Dem logs
<Kandarihu> Poor AT-ST
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I hated Logs on Star Wars Battlefront :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*heat
<otakon> okay how much did those logs weigh?
<mitamaking> The stuff the ewoks are doing would work I think
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> how does it explode?
<Meanwhile> Why did that explode?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> fail
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Curse you logs!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My brain is broken again.
<SlurryMoon> 3why does everything explode..
<XylemTube> derp
<Shizuka> 13why did it explode just from falling over
<otakon> Meanwhile: no idea
<Shizuka> 13moreover, why can't it get up?
<otakon> SlurryMoon: Baynium
<SuperBrony64> 11,02They should really remake these movies.
<Shizuka> 13it's a dumb design
<Meanwhile> Wood! My one weakness!
<Lil_B> yes he got it...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SlurryMoon and Shizuka. Because movie.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Shizuka: They wanted to show off with their budget
<otakon> SuperBrony64: BLASPHEMY!
<Fisheh_Fish> Yay
<mitamaking> SuperBrony64: joking
<Eddmario> The AT-STs have the same flaw as that robot from RoboCop: Can't use steps
<WalkerPony89> Shizuka: Movie physics
<PinkiePieYoshi64> xD
<FouLou> Shizuka: things always explode when they fall over ^-^
<Barbetos> Falling over had to be a consideration in the design of those damn things... Why would that make it explode?
<Eddmario> Also, Han just copped a feel
<SirGanjalf> dem lines
<Emocakes> ~yay~
<Darf14> Dont give George Lucas any ideas SuperBrony64
<PinkiePieYoshi64> That yay was perfect!
<Mutterguy> Oh youSB
<Dark92Enigma-RED> D'awwwwwwwwwwww
<JESmith71> Shizuka because they were carring explosives and nitro in it?
<XylemTube> <3
<JESmith71> I dunno
<Liokin> Shizuka: Same reason fruit stands always show up in car chases. Movie logic. Fall over = Explode
<Squallken> lol wookee
<Shizuka> 13i'm totally overlooking the mst3k mantra as our border ponies would have us but come on guys
<Pudge> chewie to the rescue
<Shizuka> 13admit it, star wars has issues :3

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tables. Boxes.
<XylemTube> I can see Luke and Vader on Jerry Springer for some reason
<TrixieMuffin> Those are some pretty elaborate traps for an impromptu change of plans after the main plan failed. Ewoks sure work fast.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everything.
<otakon> Shizuka: I honestly think you and the other mods should do your own commentary(audio) for one movie.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Wb Ponies47
<Obsidian> We know, we just dont care that much
<Eddmario> Shizuka: It's a series that sarted in the 70s. EVERY movie back then had issues
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Star Wars: A New Hope 3D
<owloysius> Nittany_Discord: no, just the barrels, i think
<Shizuka> 13someone tell vader his lightsaber isn't in his hand
<otakon> TrixieMuffin: yh same thing I was thinking.
<Calcos323> otakon: HOLY HELL FUND DAT SHIT

<otakon> Shizuka: why not?
<Meanwhile> otakon: she'll say no anyway. Deal w/ it.
<Shizuka> 13you underestimate my paranoia
<Mandelbrony> do lightsabers have handguards?
<Zawan> Luke: I have the high ground!
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat backflip
<Eddmario> SuperBrony64: Well, when Phantom Mennace 3D was announced, they said they'd do that with ALL 6 films...
<otakon> Shizuka: just use a voice changer dear.
<Darf14> to be honest, 3D makes me crosseyed :P
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Yes.. Vader... use your hatred...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14as in they're planning to release all the SW movies in THREE DEEE
<JESmith71> But we won't get IV in 3D until II and III. Booo!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> SaxyPretender: NOOOOOOOOO
<Dark92Enigma-RED> At least the lightsaber battle made up almost everything <--------
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Someone should tell the two of them that those lightsabers are just effects added in during post production, they aren't really in a 'To-The-Death' sword fight.
<otakon> damn you lag!
<mitamaking> This isn't a bad good vs evil discussion
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Shizuka> 13that needed more railings
<CriticKitten> Definitely.
<JESmith71> Yeah they're really hitting each other with reflective sticks
<Spectrum_Rush|> indeed
<Eddmario> JESmith71: Episode III would be awesome in 3D. 3D might be one of the ony ways II can be redeemed.
<Shizuka> 13course they have a bottomless pit over there without railings
<Meanwhile> 3D is shit.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Do you really want Lucas to screw with the original trilogy more?
<SirGanjalf> FINISH HIM

<Mutterguy> i thought Star wars was in Chronic need of more railings
<FouLou> whats the railing thingy anyway?
<Spectrum_Rush|> SuperBrony64: how can the railings do anything , when there are none
<Dark92Enigma-RED> MORE RAILINGS, MORE RAILINGS!
<Meanwhile> 3D has been shit every time the industry has tried it, and it's shit now. I can't wait for it to die.

<Meanwhile> Well this isn't really a trench, this one is still being built and has a massive exposed part.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> there goes the dish
<GabeMoist> NOT A SCRATCH
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Well, It was in the blueprints...
<otakon> SuperBrony64: lol
*Dark92Enigma-RED cracks his neck.....by accident
<OtakuTom> Yea, I remember doing this level in Rogue Leader...the outside of the Death Star was easy, the tunnel/trench was a huge pain.
<Shizuka> 13they wouldn't possibly try the same tactic twice
<RainBowJack> okay there goes the radar
<mitamaking> The shield covered the weakness

<DixInfernus> It seems to be a rule that the minimal cup size of anime/manga females is a C cup, unless the character is supposed to be "flat"

<VenHur96> I googled up this "Eikan" thing...my life wasn't the same.

<Dr-Hooves> anyone here got minecraft?
<Vordox> That's not low life, lowfn
<DixInfernus> ...I have this curious desire for an Ambrosia apple.
<TheRandomkid321> Cereal is delicious... Almost as delicious as sandvich
<Vordox> That's just hungry
<noname> lowfn: thats natural
<lowfn> Vordox: I said lowfey now lowey
<Vordox> Thought you meant lowlife
<Vordox> Sorry
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dr-Hooves: I, technically, have it
<Vordox> I do not speak AMERICANAANNASalalalalaroflolomg
<lowfn> lowfey is describing something to be similar to lowfn
<Dr-Hooves> is it a cracked version?
<noname> Dr-Hooves: I do...
<Vordox> Aaand how would people know this lowfn ?
<TheRandomkid321> Anime again? Wow.. You'd think this place is ANime State... I know it aint just ponies but damn there is ALOT of anime.
<Alpha-Omega> I think I'm going to change my name to nips
<lowfn> Vordox: Idk, Cuz my names lowfn?
<lowfn> :$
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: YEAH, who would have thought people who LOVE A PONY CARTOON would enjoy OTHER cartoons?
<Vordox> ;)
<superretroworld> just curious, this is based on the book right?
<Vordox> superretroworld: INdeed
<noname> Vordox: theres other cartoons than ponies? :O
<Vordox> Suddenly correct English Subtitles
<Vordox> :D
<OtakuTom> Plus the fact that we're kinda between seasons right now, so there's not really much to show.
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox I just aint a big fan of anime... it aint that bad but... A little feminine at times... Look whos talkign someone who watches a show about pink, talking ponies.
<HatchetRyda> noname: surprising right?
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Inded.
<superretroworld> k, then i better not watch it, i think the book will be better
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: Ironic, ain't it?
*lowfn goes downstairs to eat cereal since hes lowfey like that
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: Ainme has ALOT of tastes to offer
<Nips> ha
<Vordox> Depending on your preference, you just need someone to help you find your choice
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox It's just too random for me... I dont really like random things...
<noname> HatchetRyda: impossible, I can't accept this.
<Dovah> We should watch hellsing or berserk sometime.
<Vordox> Shounen, Shounen-Ai, Bischounen, Eechi, Boke, Seinen, etc etc.
<OtakuTom> There's anime out there that isn't random.
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: What do you like for stories?
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: Genre wise?
<Vordox> oO.o
<Vordox> DAT EPISODE NAME
<Vordox> OH SH*T
<TheRandomkid321> Oh wow I thought someone would point out me not liking randomness and y name being Random kid... Vordox I like comedy and action.
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: Comedy and action...
<Vordox> What comedy?
<OtakuTom> Comedy and action...hmm...
*Nittany_Discord 11,01puts Vordox in lolita cosplay.
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox Australian comedy...
<DixInfernus> I missed the episode name.
*Vordox strikes a loli pose.
<DixInfernus> Went to grab cereal.
<Alpha-Omega> What happened to the sub?
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: An easier way of identifying it? :)
<OtakuTom> DixInfernus, the episode title is Run Marie Run
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Vordox, you are so kawaii.
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox an a## load of swears...
<Vordox> You mean moe, right?
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: Ass load of swearing casual comedy wth Action... Hmmm...
<noname> dat brushing
<TheRandomkid321> HOW ARE THYE TALKING LIKE THA- Ugh I'm fine absolutly fine...
<Vordox> What do I feel like BECK Would be a godo choice...
<Vordox> But I think it's TOO real for your taste. :P
<OtakuTom> My immediate thought is Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, but it's definitely too random...lol
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Indeed, I think TheRandomkid321 would enjoy casual story, probably crime related.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't think we could stream P&S due to content.
<Vordox> What about seriousness, TheRandomkid321 ?
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox Yeah my favorite book series is like that. Kinda
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Errr... Panty and Stocking is NOT exactly banned here. :P
<Vordox> Figured so much TheRandomkid321
<TheRandomkid321> Its got an even ammount of COmedy, Crime, And Seriousness
<Vordox> But got any ideas, OtakuTom?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Uggh...vegetarians...
<OtakuTom> I wasn't suggesting for stream. Vordox and I are thinking of a show that TheRandomKid321 would like to (hopefully) change his general opinion on anime.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I read about the show. Seems very NSFW.
<TheRandomkid321> I would eat it
<Vordox> OtakuTom: I think he's not ready for Panty and Stocking
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321 is too "innocent" to understandd P&S
<OtakuTom> Yea, probably not...lol
<TheRandomkid321> Vegens...
<Alpha-Omega> that's a lie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's me as a kid.
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox I bet you not...
<Vordox> So far, Comedy, Crime, Serioussness.
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: Trust my sense of anime. :)
<Vordox> What abotu supernatural, TheRandomkid321 ?
<Meanwhile> Dat deer grave.
<noname> ^
<OtakuTom> hmmm...I wish I had my anime catalogue with me here...I've got a veritable buckton of it :P
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox Urr not really.
<noname> ping ping ping
<Meanwhile> Di-di-ding
<Vordox> Gotcha, that removes quite a few.
<DixInfernus> Wait... she scowled at the little girl... for making a grave?
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Crime, Serioussness and Comedy...
<TheRandomkid321> quadriple ping!
<Emocakes> DIDIDIDING
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Closest I can think is Seinen version then.
<OtakuTom> How about Case Closed?
<TheRandomkid321> Dat pissed off wranger
<OtakuTom> (Detective Conan)
<TheRandomkid321> Souless
<Vordox> Case Closed, you mean Conan?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Entertain Minime.
<TheRandomkid321> HOW IS HIS LEGS LIKE TAHT!?
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Aha. Might be, But I think it's too "kiddo" for TheRandomkid321
<OtakuTom> It took me a minute to remember the japanese title
<OtakuTom> So now I've jumped to the other end of the maturity spectrum :P
<Meanwhile> Welp, g'night everypony.
<P4ngya> I think I'd recommend Baccano to TheRandomkid321
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Even if it contains detective and murders, It's a good start, Shounen brings the action, and there's Crime, minor comedy...
<noname> Night Meanwhile
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox The books I read have graphic murder and sex scenes in them ;)
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Actually, it may be a good start. And the anime is also going on atm.
<Meanwhile> Though I can't really consider 6:30AM as night...
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: I know... Give him that suggestion then. :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Title theme drop.
*lowfn is back, he was out of damn milk and is too lazy to buy some so he just drank some water
<noname> Meanwhile: close enough :P
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: It's still a good song :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Aye :3
<Vordox> MOOOOUNTAAAAAAAAAAAUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
<Kencolt> OK. I have no idea what this is... but what the hay is Captain GLoval from Macross doing in it?
<TheRandomkid321> pointless montage... Uh... Huh
<Vordox> Kencolt: Geesus how old are you Ke...Oh right :P
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: It's not pointless.
<DixInfernus> hahaha, that's what I was wonderingsince last night Kencolt
<Alpha-Omega> pointless filler
<OtakuTom> It's a 39 episode series, there's bound to be some filler
<TheRandomkid321> ^^
<Vordox> You people think this is a filler? XD
<Vordox> inb4 relevancy
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox yes... Bet seeing how you are probably an anime fanatic...
<lowfn> No I think the camera panning to the sun is a filler
<TheRandomkid321> OH WOW!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww. The little maid hurt herself :<
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: Anyway, Me and OtakuTom recommend Detective Conan anime. :)
<OtakuTom> I'm sure it's got relevancy, but I'm just stating that there's bound to be filler at some point if it lasted 39 episodes.
<TheRandomkid321> NOT DANGEROUS AT ALL!
<Vordox> It has the genre you may enjoy TheRandomkid321
<Alpha-Omega> try watching inuyasha and not getting pissed off about filler
<Vordox> LAWL poor King
<lowfn> CHEW CHEW PUFF PUFF (spam it x9001 times)
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox I bet you I wont but eh..
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Putt-Putt is in this show?
<Vordox> DAMNIT KID
<DixInfernus> ....How far....
<Kencolt> So anyway-- what is this?

<Eulshy> SHE SMOKES
<TheRandomkid321> I like trains....
<Roxsnow> Hello Vordox.
<OtakuTom> Alpha-Omega, how about Naruto? About half that series was filler (before they did the jump to Shippuden)
<lowfn> Shes going to go the wrong way
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: I guess OtakuTom may have a good place where you can view it, TheRandomkid321
<lowfn> LEFT

<Vordox> DAT SONG
<Spectrum_Rush|> well that sucked, plugin failure then router craps out -_-
<OtakuTom> I'm trying to think of where it would be available...
<TheRandomkid321> Vordox I only hate anime because my worst enemy loves it.
<Vordox> OtakuTom: anime44 has a pretty good selections
<Kencolt> What show IS this?
<Sumica> 00,10you would think she would have notice things like that
<OtakuTom> I've never been to anime44
<SuperBrony64> 11,02And now this entire episode is them walking and singing...it's not a Disney movie everypony.
<Vordox> TheRandomkid321: Same with ponies? :P

<Vordox> BAD LUCK VILLIAN
<HatchetRyda> king is strong lol
<Kencolt> This is ann untenable position.

<TheRandomkid321> FILLER!
<OtakuTom> Vordox, what do you think of Shikabane Hime? Not so much comedy, but it's got some great action.

Strong also voiced the African American boy in the Ball in a Cup advertisement in "The Fat Guy Strangler".
