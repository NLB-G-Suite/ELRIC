<Darcy> Chocolate rain, you guys
<btown> so... 1 more week for the conclusion?
<Antarctic> thanks
<acedis> is this live from the hub too? The rerun?
<Silverscreen> Way to go Crusaders. You just unleashed an age-old-evil upon equestria.
<Frostys_Den> TBH on its own, its only a 2 star ep. if the conclusion is good, It can hit probably 4star, but not 5star status.
<Trainguyxx> o)o new opening is it not?
<mib_g2ut6y> Fuck yeah.
<mib_speumb> oh there is theme song:D
<SlurryMoon> I think that The CMC's fighting caused Discord's return
<lolstaz> so the CMC brought dischord back to life?
<Hoofington> next week
<TonySki> flutterbitch
<Euponytor> You can all have DISCORD as your cutie mark
<Chief_Rampancy> ZERO LAG IS BEST LAG
<lolstaz> NOOOOOO
<Ayasu> Flutterbitch *nodnod*
<mib_64g9wg> Cool and unusual punishment

<Epic_Mount> Thanks for repeating it!
<Marfikent> seems so
<Kencolt> Yess.
<The_Mole> i saw snails... where was snips
<DashWithRainbows> dat theme
<Athenor> My guess is that Ep. 2 airs next week, as it is a weekly show.
<mib_0vh4qw> lol
<Grundle> I approve. Discord is a fucking sweet villain.
<Eggmaster2029> the opening is the exact same?
<mib_l4ltuh> Eeyup
<Ayasu> And yeah, wait a week.
<MrBear97> I still want to see + hear luna's voice
<Bronydude> that was just amazing
<mib_8malsw> thats a bit gay
<celebrir> xtreme lag!
<mib_0vh4qw> when is this on youtube?
<mib_pz9mdy> there are going to be soo many memes from this one episode
<Lunafanatic> i hope that next episode wont have the lag
<AllisZero> Why did I start drinking this early if it wasn't to watch two episodes?
<The_Mole> i must have missed him
<mallam> y the theme song b teh same?
<Metostopholes> Ah, my steam stopped
<VanillaBean> Cheerilee's students dwindled in numbers..
<princessspring> I made it!
<mib_sqr166> guess so
<Eggmaster2029> i thought it would be different
<Firetaffer> WOH GUYS! WHERE IS LUNA? SHE'LL FIX THIS!!!
<Epic_Mount> I was terrified I would miss it when I couldn't get through.
<ValtheJean> nope
<acedis> I thought the stream switched over to a recording
<powderedlightning> Y TWICE PUT THE FREAKIN SECOND PAR
<Chex> So it looks decent so far but
<mib_ev1g6k> thanks for doing a rebroadcast guys
<mib_q2z8uz> Flutterbitch is now a meme
*Epic_Mount hugs
<rubenflonne> CmC did it, figures
<powderedlightning> T
<Thedumplingz> no new theme song?
<Pinkamena> I am seriously disappointed by the lack of Pinkamena
<AllisZero> Damn it

<Bendyrulz> they're replaying it on another thing and it's being nice to me
<Admiral_Ackbar> Okay, time for me to go to sleep.
<Blendtec> ponies in town looked different in the opening
<Shyfluttershy> Is someone streaming the other episodes? I can't get them here...
<DashWithRainbows> he was there
<prince-dari> If I get lag it goes when I refresh the strema.
<MrBear97> Cuz' lets face it, she's mentioned at least four times
<Chex> I'm not liking the title dropping
<UK_brony> i wonder if the episode is ALREADY available to download.
<KidA> Well good thing it's replaying. I couldn't watch the intrp
<mib_es9bhb> Is this the first episode?
<Celestianspirit> i love it

<Sean> What did I miss?
<The_Flyin_King> They need derpy hooves
<SBaraban> It's on right now
<bar> really, it was so fast, I thought the beginning sequence was meant to be a dream
<Llamaq> No, it's just the first episode
<thomsonr> its raining poop
<lonelypony> so we missed it?
<Flameshy> hahahaha
<SBaraban> if you're not poor.
<Kencolt> That's assuming Luna is even involved.
<mib_n5zb1d> yep part two is on the 24th
<a041744> U FAIL
<RoboPlop> You know things are bad when the failsafe spell fails.
<The_Flyin_King> or is derpy hooves the villain?
<celebrir> Why does it shows part1 again for me?
<r0ninKai> I'm having some shit here on my end
<Wolfur> i thought this was a double episode??
<mib_65freu> :3
<desertman> this is also ep1
<FreezeFrame> Rainbow saluting is the best thing ever.
<r0ninKai> lagging like hell!
<Strigoides_> Refreshing youtube furiously
<Winterwing> XD Pinkie Pie!
<Drakmoth141> Seriously about the lag?
<MASTERLINKX> ALL MY PONIES
<Rider> minus the tech issues with the new player and the laggy chat, this went pretty decently
<thatoneguy> eh
<Daginni> No, you didnt miss it. It's rerunning
<Bendyrulz> 6becuase there's no part 2
<NewDCD> 9stream's stabilized
<Cranberry_Scotch> All we saw was the statue cracking, shattering
<SBaraban> WOW THAT DID ALOT, TWILIGHT
<ProfesorRod> re-run
<AdamHammer> i didnt necessarily get how discord escaped either
<EpicSaxPony> It does that for everyone.
<a041744> Same episode back to back
<thatoneguy> its probably on youtube
<SuperBrony64> Pinkie Pie is happyâ¦nothing new to report
<mib_0vh4qw> im lagging too
<Q> Pegasus master race is proven. Discord had to force it on RD and FS
<Dark_Horst> ai kink<
<RAWRity> celebrir because that's what's on
<VanillaBean> rawr
<gangplankgalley> wait, the next episode is next week?
<BagofShenanigans> It's sad that I knew this room would be the least crowded
<MissingPony> Dat: The show already played first episode, this is an immediate rerun.
<bishojo_kitsune> Same here!
<Soup_or_man> jeez, the pacing is kind of ridiculous, but i suppose it's kind of unavoidable with the limited time they have for the episodes
<Ratlan> Anyone notice how her book wasn't being damaged by chocolate milk rain?
<mallam> pinkie gets fat
<Cranberry_Scotch> not shattering*
<mib_p2hkgd> I thought Discord looked a little like Yaridovich xD
<gangplankgalley> fuckkk
<Dark_Horst> pinkie
<The_Mole> nope... part 2 airs in a week
<Drakmoth141> earth?
<AdamHammer> ya
<mib_juf0hy> hm
<Drakmoth141> hehehe
<Natleyn> Bendyrulz: No colors, please.
<mib_0vh4qw> AHH
<AdamHammer> lol
<DumbRock> so... failight sparkle, cornjack, umbrellity, flutterjerk, pinkie pig and...
<MASTERLINKX> this episode was delicious
<TyeDyeBrony> We have seen episode one once, and now again for reference. TIME TO COMMENCE ART MAKING.
<mib_n5zb1d> whelp, onto mincraft
<lonelypony> when?
<Lunaros> I gtg, thanks for the epic times :D
<Nyst> The stream is most certainly not stabilized! I still can't get in!
<Nomikos> Discord is like some awesome cross between Q and Sheogorath
<Bendyrulz> 0: okay:
<MantisToboggan> it's a shame your stream didn't work :(
<celebrir> Wont it show part 2 today?
<The_Flyin_King> Bunny is slenderman?
<mib_0vh4qw> hey
<Kahrn> yes, next week
<Tsuki> The hub hates us.
<Ratlan> Nooooo
<Kahrn> same time
<mib_0vh4qw> minecraft?
<DashOrCrash> The hub is trolling us with a repeat of part 1
<FwriedWrice> deezert
<mib_ackjc1> when will be hte next ep ?
<DumbRock> something for rainbow...
<Q> No explanation for thwyt eh CMC was fighting at the start though
<The_Mole> discord's voice seemed to work well
<vteck9> Welp I going to sleep. Been up for over 24 hours.
<MantisToboggan> now to wait for youtube
<mib_0vh4qw> YEAH
<AussieRainbow> slendbunnies
<DashOrCrash> rather than part 2
<KidA> They promised a lot more Luna in this new season. With a season opener as amazing as this I don't think the second episode will be missing any Luna
<mib_juf0hy> thats ridicolous
<Antarctic> the other rooms are more crowded? but rarity is best pony
<Ratlan> Popcorn for small animals is bad, BAD
<KidA> And socks
<BagofShenanigans> part 2 comes out in a week.
<mib_0vh4qw> minecraft pwnes
<FreezeFrame> Discord forced it on Fluttershy and couldn't actually make RD Disloyal
<Spectrum> seriously. those bunnies are FUCKED UP
<cloudy_sparks> IITTTSS RAINING MEN
<hero_spirit> NEVER GIVE UP. NEVER SURRENDER.
<KidA> Yeah
<AdamHammer> i agree mole
<Daniel> æ¨å¥½
<mib_juf0hy> or however thats spelled
<RoboPlop> To the balloon!
<PinkyPyro> next week?
<princessspring> epic fast reader
<arrakiz> this episode is seriously wicked...
<mib_g4pb6y> enderbunnies
<mib_0vh4qw> LAG ALG ALG ALGLAGA GALGALGAGL
<catwich> godd damnit i fell asleep and now i just got back up xC
<vteck9> Have fun everypony
<Blendtec> spike has acid reflux, looked like that hurt
<rasc> They were fighting because of Discord, I think
<Windy> The whole thing seemed to work well.
<Holygriever> NEVER GIVE UP. NEVER GIVE IN.
<Chief_Rampancy> COTTONDASH
<Srake> They learn a lesson this early in the ep then just forget it
<AussieRainbow> lenderrabbits
<Windy> I was surprised.
<DashOrCrash> ah well, Ima go nuke egypt
<EpicSaxPony> Nope because fuck you dedicated fanbase.
<gangplankgalley> yeah, i watched this on tv first, when i saw it was the same episode i raged
<BagofShenanigans> Ha, slenderbunnies
<Euponytor> RoboPlop: *batman spinning sound*
<catwich> fuckkk
<SBaraban> DELICIOUS COTTON CAND CLOUDS :D
<Pinkie_Pie2> Next episode is next week??
<mib_dskixh> I wonder
<mib_dskixh> WHERE IS LUNA
<brony4life> lol derpy would be the villian for this
<brony4life> but no
<thomsonr> its poop
<The_Flyin_King> Did they use up all their budget on this?
<AussieRainbow> enderrabiits*
<MissingPony> FreezeFrame: In a way, he did make RD disloyal.
<KanyeEast> its weird seeing celestia acting less godlike
<DashOrCrash> or maybe china...
<brony4life> it's back
<Holygriever> WON'T STOP THE MUSIC, COZ I'M GONNA WIN!
<mib_juf0hy> two parter, two episedodes, wat do, show first twice
<MissingPony> To her friends.
<hero_spirit> I'm guessing next week, but it's just a guess
<Ayasu> lol Enderbunnies
<Bendyrulz> 0Rarity is underrated, Antarctic
<Jon> Well.I say that was an interesting opening episode.
<Windy> My expectations, while low, were exceeded.
<Tsuki> Same time?! Dang, I dunno if I can do this every week. xD
<APPLEBLOOM> OMG
<r0ninKai> I blame Discord for this lag!
<Holygriever> DUSTY ROADS, ALL THE WAY!
<DashOrCrash> (civilization 5)
<mib_2jiie9> http://ponycountdown.com/ to keep track of the next episode
<APPLEBLOOM> IM WATCHING EP 1

<GaruuSpike> Chocolate raaain
<Octavia> 13Okay guys, enough with the caps
<SBaraban> THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN'T DO IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER
<Winterwing> PACING?! THAT'S... OOC?! But it's canon now! GAH! MY HEAD!
<mib_p2hkgd> I still have no idea how Discord made all the ponies act different.
<Nomikos> he divided RD's loyalties
<Srake> IS LUNA DISCORD! *GASP*
<Buckbeak> I WANT MY MLP
<SAFR_> Flutterbitch was wonderful
<DandyLion> Celestia included Luna a lot when she was talking, so that's a start
<Grundle> Celestia being trolled = holy shit
<thomsonr> discord
<SBaraban> Umad.
<mib_xp2odw> No luna in season 2? woe is me
<Zed_> Discord had to tap into their more deep-seated fears to manipulate them.
<Dark_Horst> fuck endershit
<NewDCD> 9Natleyn: after the episode
<SuperBrony64> APPLEBLOOM: I feel for you.
<Holygriever> LEAVING THE PAST BEHIND US, YEEEEEEEEEEEAH!
<Zed_> Except Rarity.
<brony4life> hopefully more luna in part 3
<lonelypony> where is come back on??????
<Lunafanatic> ive noticed we havent seen luna yet...
<mib_p2hkgd> Was it hypnotism?
<Antarctic> haha
<SBaraban> *Paces*
<mib_u3tjk9> why did it repeat?
<cloudy_sparks> MEN MEN
<Ayasu> Take care all. =P
<Windy> He's super powerful.
<KidA> Yeah
<Lunafanatic> this sucks!
<thomsonr> hes a troll
<arrakiz> oh yeh badass celestia incoming
<mib_xtsfjm> laag
<Holygriever> Ok, enough with the caps.
<Lucid294> Or part 2
<Natleyn> Sweet.
<Dark_Horst> endermen are just pussie ass versions of the slenderman
<DumbRock> princess uselesstia
<Drakmoth141> Stop skipping...
<AdamHammer> somethin like that
<brony4life> *part 2
<RoboPlop> She at least gets a mention.
<princessspring> Tyranny song
<Natleyn> MECHAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Lyokowarirtitan> start with china or their infrastructure will kill you
<MantisToboggan> they reaaally rushed the premise of the story, hopefully the next part has more room to breath
<Lunafanatic> season 2 needs more luna!!!
<gangplankgalley> or derpy
<Holygriever> *behaves*
<RAWRity> what's so OOC to be pacing when in danger?
<Buckbeak> i dont get hub :(
<Jon> I like what he did with rarity
<EpicSaxPony> Inb4 discord's in the windows
<mib_74jvvs> kinda too much action for 22 mins imo >,< too fast
<The_Mole> well i know where im going to watch the second season XD
<Bendyrulz> 0^
<BTTB> GUYS
<Flameshy> why is there still no Luna
<Chief_Rampancy> CELESTIA IS SO ANIMATED
<mib_g4pb6y> My god discord rules putsburg
<Hobbes> Only saw half of the show. NOOOOOO. Gotta watch aain
<BTTB> LISTEN
<Windy> He's as powerful as Celestia.
<Grundle> Luna at least got a mention
<thomsonr> trollcord
<Jon> Complete greed.
<Octavia> 13lol Too late!
<DashOrCrash> If we don't see luna, I'll have to have a "word" with the Hub
<LiquidWolf> 0everypony is being trolled
<APPLEBLOOM> ?
<DeniedExistenceMob-1> Well at least Fluttershy won!
<The_Mole> i dont have tv so... HERE!
<GaruuSpike> HUB, I am disappoint :|
<mib_0ey09e> and then I got rid of my sister
<APPLEBLOOM> OMFG IM SO HAPPY
<APPLEBLOOM> <.3
<Cranberry_Scotch> If not stronger
<HoMM> I disagree
<Nittany_Tiger> Stream is failing on my PC.
<BTTB> What if in part 2
<Windy> Just opposite energy
<APPLEBLOOM> <.....3
<lolstaz> I LOVE PONIES GUYS :'(
<KanyeEast> makes sense rainbowdash is a loyalist to the monarchy
<HoMM> this is very good
<Antarctic> perhaps because this theatre is less crowded, the chat and/or stream is smoother also?
<mib_apjo2b> When is episode 2 comming on?
<Drakmoth141> gangplankgalley: how can Derpy be in the first 2 episodes already? XD
<KidA> He must be Trollesia's long-lost half-brother :O
<Pinkamena> Grundle: That's better than 75% of season 1's episodes if not more
<mib_0vh4qw> My little Fony
<SAFR_> I will sit in this chair until a week passes for the next episode
<Pinkamena> -_-
<NewDCD> 9AFTER THIS EPISODE: Mazinkaiser SKL followed by the two Gurren Lagann movies
<DumbRock> hey... where is spike?
<DashOrCrash> and I will be speaking with bombs.
<SBaraban> Yeah, Garuu, too many commercials
<mallam> no celestia is trolling again she can probably destroy him in 10 seconds flat
<CradeElcin> Luna namedrop but she is not there
<FwriedWrice> think next week
<Holygriever> I said I was stopping... :(
<Dark_Horst> NEXT WEEK
<Windy> Right?
<Cranberry_Scotch> Remember, it took both princesses to take him down the first time
<Dark_Horst> HAHAAAAAA
<DannyBrony> So early... but ill do my best to watch these new episodes.
<The_Flyin_King> Finally
<Euponytor> it's a weekly show
<Andreasfr> next week
<KidA> [Discord}

<The_Flyin_King> New bad guy, lets bust the elements of harmony
<VanillaBean> Give the animators a break.. You'll see her soon, don't get your tail up in a knot.
<SBaraban> Indeed, crade
<mib_apjo2b> NEXT WEEK?
<Kahrn> Celestia's tail flowing 'forward' as she walks looks weeeird
<prince-dari> INB4 horn glory hole
<mib_juf0hy> probably powerfuller than celestia since it was her+luna and the elements the first tome
<Grundle> So, guys.
<mib_apjo2b> ;-;
<desertman> Why are we muting so often?
<FwriedWrice> eyup
<mib_speumb> the thing i want the most in season 2 is derpy hooves and luna
<EpicSaxPony> I didn't even bother to go on Ponychan last night
<mib_juf0hy> time*
<CradeElcin> why cant she be there? :(
<mib_0vh4qw> DISCO-rd
<Bendyrulz> 0Spike was devoured by Discord
<Hellspawn> 0lol error sound
<MASTERLINKX> poni
<Grundle> I think this is my new favorite episode.

<Arfiol> CHOCOLATE RAIN
<Graffy_Hooves> hahahaha horn glory hole
<Arfiol> SOME STAY DRY AND OTHERS FEEL THE PAIN
<mib_p2hkgd> It just seems kinda lame that he forces them to act one way instead of letting them choose for themselves.
<BTTB> Guys, what if in part 2 the CMC come back and save the day
<mib_apjo2b> Will episode 2 come on here?
<shadowLurker> OK, where is Luna?
<Rider> DCD for the win!
<Nittany_Tiger> Crap.
<FreezeFrame> Celestia definitely used laughter
<Lucid294> chocolate rain
<eggmaster2029> indeed
<Euponytor> CHOCOLATE RAIN
<Hobbes> the commercial weren't a big deal. At least they allowed the streaming
<eggmaster2029> incoming
<Dark_Horst> look, they got lore-telling stained windows
<Zed_> CHOCOLATE RAIN
<The_Mole> well discord seems to be older than both princess celestia and princess luna, so...
<CradeElcin> HOLD ON
<NewDCD> 9Celestia Wingboner
<mib_sllin0> LOL
<BagofShenanigans> Chocolate rain...
<brony4life> chocolate rain
<SuperBrony64> Lol Pinkie
<disbdu> The ponies are Belmonts, aren't they?
<eggmaster2029> THERE YOU GO
<Ratlan> Wait, so it took the powers of two incredibly powerful ponies AND the Elements of Harmony to defeat Discord, and Celestia believes 6 small ponies can?...
<mallam> pinkie pie...
<Drakengarde> Hahahahah!
<a041744> Atleast Luna got a mention
<Dark_Horst> bitches are LEGENDS now
<AdamHammer> lol that would b awesome
<green> Pinky makes a good point
<SBaraban> She?
<eggmaster2029> SOME STAY DRY
<Pinkamena> I'm actually a little disappointed by Discord
<Nomikos> Princess Celestia is using the Robocop-model security system, I see
<arrakiz> why there is no luna?!
<mib_p3yit2> queue the "Chocolate rain" meme...
<princessspring> Pinkie pie be evil
<CradeElcin> ETERNAL CHAOS comes with CHOCOLATE RAIN!! you guys!

<Poots> the music is pretty awesome you gotta admit
<Grundle> Whatever the opposite of disappointed is.
<NewDCD> 9stream has stabilized
<Yoshi> celestia used... a glory hole

<APPLEBLOOM> omfg
<Chex> Now it just references stuff
<rasc> honestly*
<RoboPlop> So it really is airing twice in a row?
<Waifles> I'm pretty amazed that Pinkie Pie isn't taking this thing a bit more seriously
<The_Flyin_King> and i bet pinkie pie is going to sing a reference to it
<mib_h4g3qs> RD should have been super competitive and confrontational, then got angry and left by climbing
<Dark_Horst> well chex, have you EVER SEEN q?
<Pinkamena> that alone makes him passable
<mib_ssuaj1> lol i missed the beginnning

<mib_iwaoz9> BECAUSE ITS THAT GOOD
<mib_kirgl5> we gonna have to wait until next saturday for episode 2 ?
<RAWRity> I especially love how Fluttershy's encounter was just like how trolls go against the "love and tolerance" stuff.
<Plobadob> -.- retarded American kids adverts...

<Sean> I came in about the time they were dealing with the chocolate rain
<Kammerjunk> Sooo... Next week, same time?

<Pinkamena> no evil laugh, none of that
<Winterwing> If you need me, I'll be outside with Pinkie Pie!
<The_Mole> well.... that commercial isnt good
<Drakengarde> Great, why the hell do I imagine Pinkie now voiced by Tay Zonday?

<vraiment> next episodes airs next week
<SmokeyTreble> for people that missed it the first time

<Holygriever> Screw the elements, I want my pegasi back.

<Grundle> The evil laugh is part of what makes him awesome, he's an over-the-top cartoon villain
<Sen> I'm with WinterWing
<TappTapp> alright, I'm gonna go try and calm down
<Winterwing> Dumb... I will have my revenge!
<vraiment> XDDDDDDDD +1 SAFR_
<Lapper> its Fluttershy not flootershai
<KanyeEast> I liked the reference, it was oblique enough that it wasn't obvious to anyone who wasn't familiar with the meme
<TappTapp> stay cool bronies
<Flootershai> when is part two?
<mib_kirgl5> man such a looooooonnnnnnnnggggggggggggggg wait

<mib_p8rbik> MORE LIUNA NOW!
<filleg> BABIES

<DashOrCrash> Much of what he says is like what I always say
<mib_2dmb1o> I missed it... eugh.
<KidA> Well. That was completely worth the months of wait. I'm out
<Euponytor> crib life
<APPLEBLOOM> OMG
<Pinkamena> Flootershai: Next week
<Sen> I lost the game!
<Drakmoth141> im dissapointed in season 2 here...the stream keeps skipping and lagging D:<
<SeriousSeal> Everybody is comingin..
<Dark_Horst> discord, behaves like q, has the abilities of q, speaks like q and sounds like q due to having his actor speaking him
<Euponytor> IT'S A GOOD LIFE
<filleg> I must have
<mib_ykbmft> its tearing thier friendship apart
<thomsonr> yand got an essay
<btown> Flutterguy V2 voiced by Tay Zonday
<MeteorVenture> crib life + G3.5 = ????
<APPLEBLOOM> CRIBLIFE..
<Euponytor> >anthony fremont
<The_Mole> that commercial... walmart black friday rage... o.o
<MASTERLINKX> this is quite the awesome season premier, now we must wake 7 days.
<SeriousSeal> it makes me mad
<Lasharus> They're bloody scary. :P
<rubenflonne> next week
<KidA> Seeyas
<Scootaloo> U GUYS MAD? I RELEASED DISCORD
<Rare> Zatheyll: I like it
<Octavia> 13Testin something. :P
<APPLEBLOOM> THATS SO CREEPY
<jayands> discord watches the Internet.
<mib_p2hkgd> They repeat it because the Hub is showing the first episode twice in case some people missed the first one.
<mib_juf0hy> wait
<Poots> crib lief awwww yeeeah
<brony4life> bratz babies?
<MASTERLINKX> wait*
<RadicalEdward2> im out too
<mib_k0spia> OH MY GAWD I DON'T WANT TO WAIT

<bron4eva> Go Daniel!!! You make lauren proud!
<Cranberry_Scotch> Luna was just mentioned this episode
<Bendyrulz> 0Give is Luna or give us death!
<Winterwing> Serial! Luna could have been the one to explain all of that!
<ButtonMasher> Thanks for the stream and company bronies! Now I have to spend time with my RL friends :P
<Nyst> American television. They have ads because attention spans are shorter.
<VanillaBean> Lapper: There's a user here named Flootershai, silly.
<mib_2bs2g4> I can tell you right now no little girl would buy a discord toy, ony bronies would.
<RAWRity> so what's everypony's opinion on discord?
<thomsonr> and classmates laugh
<ButterBowl> never seen babies like this
<jayands> and waits.
<Bendyrulz> 0us*
<mib_pqyl62> CHURRO RAIN
<Hellspawn> 0BORN UGLY
<Nittany_Tiger> Why so many +m?!
<The_Flyin_King> How'd they lose the elements of harmony this time
<mib_juf0hy> we are allready watching reruns of season 2
<KanyeEast> basically this is where Q went after next generation
<SBaraban> Hey Y'all, Sniggidy Diggidy
<Dark_Horst> discord is the exact q from star trek
<Jon> Question?The stream isn't working on co.cc and I can't get into a room on the main site.
<vraiment> so awesome
<mib_h4g3qs> Flutterrude
<Graffy_Hooves> uggghhhhh cribe life commercial >.<
<Drakengarde> YPT/YTMV of that...
<DerrPouf> More like Cripples
<Jon> What do I do?
<mib_v2zk9p> ///
<The_Flyin_King> I read a comic where they broke them
<Sen> Great villian
<Hobbes> thats why its two parts. Ot'll be all resolved next week
<Pinkamena> anyway I'm going to X out the stream now, I've got music to listen to
<DashOrCrash> I have to agree that making sense is kinda boring.
<Cyl> I liked friday afternoons. I was already awake. I don't want to wake up for pony
<Bendyrulz> 0seems legit
<Winterwing> He's awesome!
<bron4eva> @Cranberry. I know... MORE Luna!
<mib_2bs2g4> lol
<BagofShenanigans> I think he's high
<Octavia> 13To test something.
<mib_ev1g6k> epicness
<Calamity> Part 2, Y U NO COME FASTER?!
<mib_kirgl5> *In Applebloom voice* I WANT IT NOW!!!!!!!!
<The_Lobe> I really liked this ep, but I kinda wish they saved the story for a movie
<The_Mole> hah
<DashOrCrash> GRAPES
<mib_mspmqo> lol
<thomsonr> and discord statue cracks
<Windy> Right?
<mib_p2hkgd> I'm okay with this
<Blazingstorm> Whoo! season 2!!!!
<hero_spirit> So... Discord = god of trolling?
<CrainyGB> discord might be the best villian yet
<Scootaloo> DONT CALL ME THINGS I DONT KNOW THE MEANING OF
<mib_2bs2g4> we devoted
<HoMM> is part 2 in a week?
<Arfiol> The hub endorses baby prostitution.
<HoMM> FUCK
<The_Flyin_King> applejack lost it in a bet, and rainbow dash lost them both in a bit
<Plobadob> No, I have never seen babies like this, and I don't want to EVER AGAIN
<The_Lobe> Felt rushed
<prince-dari> CHURRO!
<mib_6p5hz2> I CANNOT SEE.
<The_Flyin_King> *bet
<Drakengarde> Only time will tell!
<LiquidWolf> 0man, this episode was worth staying up all night for it
<Winterwing> But NMM looks WAY cooler!
<Wizzardess> Definitely worthy of villian status.
<Multifish> I can't believe she's actually been mentioned OUTSIDE of the first episode!!!
<Dark_Horst> these guys knew what they created when they hired jogn de nancy
<broHooves> its lagging a lot. my computer fails
<The_Flyin_King> "I hate losing"
<EpicSaxPony> Discord is best whateverdafuqheis
<flutterdouche> you would think a statue of everything you stand against would be in a safer place
<Sean> There's only one episode of Season two though :P
<Windy> But does Hasbro understand their real target audience?
<vraiment> Or maybe during the whole seasone?
<Vis> I always enjoy troll villains
<Holygriever> I don't like Rarity being broken that easily.
<Seirei> is the amount of ads normal for american tv?
<SBaraban> Also, this is actually live.
<KanyeEast> he must have gotten bored waiting for John Luc Picard to show up
<Hobbes> yes part two is next week
<mib_sllin0> wow, i thought LAST week was long...this week will kill me
<Grundle> Bonus points for the writers if it turns out Celestia had the elements hidden away all along
<mib_0vh4qw> BIITBOOOX
<Xerlith> He looks weird, but definitely beats NMM in terms of villainy.
<mib_l0b2p0> Discord=Q
<Buckbeak> how do i watch?
<SBaraban> I applaud you, BronyState.
<rubenflonne> quite
<Seirei> it's like every 5 seconds
<desertman> yes it is
<thomsonr> I WANT PRESS DOUGH
<bishojo_kitsune> they're in denial
<jayands> I agree, Wolf
<SeriousSeal> I wish we could pause the video without missing anything...
<HoMM> aaaaaaaaaaaa
<mib_0vh4qw> PENIS
<BagofShenanigans> Hey! it's edible play-doh
<Jon> Yes.This is normal.
<sangaire> OMG get back to the danm show!
<Chex> wow what the heck ponychan
<AllisZero> Okay, I need to go learn to bake cakes so I can make a Fluttershy-decorated birthday cake for myself
<flutterdouche> especally if it contained everything you stand against
<mib_l0b2p0> Hence a mega Troll
<SuperBrony64> Pinkie Pie would love this toy!
<Blazingstorm> so um
<Windy> HA!
<powderedlightning> DAMN COOKIES
<Lasharus> Of course not Sangaire.
<blablabla> does ad i america are always so short?
<SAFR_> Oh yeah
<Sen> Great voice
<Tsuki> Yes.
<HoMM> @serious just turn off audio
<Scootaloo> CHOCOLATE RAIN
<SBaraban> No, Seiri, HUB is just being a dick.
<jayands> lol grundle
<Chex> How many S2E1 threads do we need
<bron4eva> @Windy: Look at this, of course they do! This episode is awesome-packed
<Graffy_Hooves> Nyst we have ads because companies life money. lots of money
<prince-dari> There's no lag, if you have lag try the LQ version
<Winterwing> He just wants to have fun! 8D
<mib_h4g3qs> Rarity resisted more than pinkie...
<HoMM> as good as pausing basically
<Kencolt> Hey-- it lasted longer than the moon did, give some credit.
<DumbRock> actually, luna wasn't mentiones in the first episode
<RainbroChillington> omgomgomgomg
<vraiment> Yeah SeriousSeal I have to go to the bathroom
<ButterBowl> It wouldn't be pretty in a cell
<mib_65freu> he plays on there biggest weakness though
<mib_0vh4qw> no1 cares ads
<Buckbeak> y is the broadcast offli
<princessspring> Yummy
<RAWRity> the voice reminds me of the old school villains from the Disney animated films.
<Blazingstorm> the elements arent the crown and necklesses
<Whiskra> THIS IS THE ANSWER TO HOW PONIES ARE MADE
<SAFR_> There weren't any new songs in this one
<RainbroChillington> best episode ever
<Bendyrulz> 0fuck off ads
<thomsonr> I WANT TO SEE IT MAKE CUPCAKES
<HoMM> and then turn audio back on
<mib_lh33fz> So.. we have to wait a whole week long?
<Lasharus> It's the US, they need a 1:1 ratio of commercial time vs airing time.
<mib_0vh4qw> no1 cares -.-
<Windy> I KNOW!
<SeriousSeal> i dont wantto miss te video
<Windy> That was EPIC!
<LordCelestia> If cookies are my god damn friends then im eating my god damn friends
<mib_juf0hy> damnit im half hoping theyll run pt2 after this
<RainbroChillington> I KNOW!
<AdamHammer> lol
<mib_0vh4qw> haha
<ProfesorRod> I'd rather puddles of chocolate milk than ads
<ProfesorRod> CHURRO!
<Nittany_Tiger> This actually seems quite many than normal.
<EpicSaxPony> PRESTO
<AdamHammer> agreed
<HoMM> ya do what I said
<mib_l0b2p0> that's next episode
<mib_6p5hz2> I couldn't even see it...
<mib_2bs2g4> Of course the rarity room only starts working after I had to watch it on tv -_-
<thomsonr> I JUST WANT PRESS DOUGH\
<mib_i19s3i> i would never describe a cookie as "pleasy"
<glitch> is it over? It's over isn't it?
<BagofShenanigans> Isn't he played by that one dude from Star Treck?
<hero_spirit> If we put Discord and Q in the same room...
<Natleyn> mfw region specific commercials
<RainbroChillington> Discord was the perfect G-Rated villain
<Wolfur> i watch on a different stream as this one isn't working anymore :(
<DashOrCrash> Someone should make a picture of Discord making a trollface
<Lasharus> Nobody knows WHY, but it's astonishingly annoying.
<brony4life> oh god don't say that lasharus
<Blazingstorm> they just represent them
<hero_spirit> What would happen.
<mib_sllin0> refresh stream
<Geron> Wow, am what I watching now a tv commercial? Its... stupid.
<Wizzardess> Yep.
<ButterBowl> Did anyone else see derpy?
<Antarctic> he is a ham
<Winterwing> GIVE ME CHOCOLATE MILK OR GIVE ME DEATH!
<Poots> "It's real food!"
<Multifish> We are now in for six and a half months of ponies...
<HoMM> discord wins
<mib_0vh4qw> this baking kid
<mib_pqyl62> Pillsbury Doughpony?
<mib_i19s3i> yea, Q
<Drakengarde> ...I actually thought that was all Play-Doh or something at first.
<brony4life> they will take you seriously
<VanillaBean> wait a minute, THAT PLAY DOUGH IS EDIBLE?!
<sangaire> god danm! japanese tv doesn't even have this many ads in a day that they have showed so far!
<Blazingstorm> absolutely
<vraiment> who's Q?
<mib_0vh4qw> XD
<MASTERLINKX> never
<DashOrCrash> that would be all kinds of win
<desertman> I figured someone would join with that name
<HoMM> gg no re
<SuperBrony64> *calls number*
<mib_sllin0> if broadcast is off
<mib_es9bhb> In america, it seems people assumes kids are retarded
<Lasharus> Why not? It's pretty much accurate Brony4life. :P
<Windy> yes it's over.
<Antarctic> he is also pretty lulz
<VDandMori> FChan?
<Bendyrulz> 0Q or whateever
<mib_l0b2p0> Magic
<Lucid294> Place your bets here. How long until it gets put on Youtube?
<bron4eva> I was squeeing! I, a 19 year old male, was squeeing for the first time in my life.. God, it was so beautiful.
<The_Flyin_King> Rainboom shots are for true russian vodka drinkers.
<mib_es9bhb> by default
<Ratlan> Well, he's a decent villain, but the ponies seem too stupid for what they fall for. Fluttershy was the only one who he couldn't trick.
<FAH> Q from Next Gen
<DumbRock> where did the secret butt fun go?
<Poots> "Watch out! They're E-bumpin!"
<Windy> Epic.
<princessspring> Slender pony already covered that
<mib_q99xvp> So, what do you guys think of discord?
<mib_mcyqgi> just press play again
<LordCelestia> WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY.
<SBaraban> I'm watching this while my TV is on HUB. Inception anyone?
<Grundle> I thought play dough was always edible?
<Nittany_Tiger> Hasbro loves commercials.
<mib_me322n> wtf is going on???
<Maerarde> a'
<glitch> NNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!
<PercyVee> Discord *is* Q. It's just like watching him on TNG.
<VDandMori> 4Chan
<eggmaster2029> masterlinkx?
<BronyFromAustralia> omg
<powderedlightning> BG MUSIC MAKES MY EERS BLEED
<RAWRity> multifish I'M SO HAPPY
<Tsuki> Y no ponies, press dough?
<merrik> hahah press dough (presto) i seee what they did there
<TheBanteringBrony> AH WANT PAHRT TEW NAO
<RainbroChillington> I squeed so much
<EpicSaxPony> How many eps in this season?
<APPLEBLOOM> GOD DAMMIT WHY CANT I GET THE HUB ON TV
<prince-dari> The broadcast is online.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Like I said before, compared to the months waiting for this episode, waiting just a week at a time for the rest is a pittance
<DerrPouf> Nobody noticed Mortak Dashbat?
<Kahrn> Its been done dash
<thomsonr> i want to be on the game of life
<arrakiz> he's Q
<APPLEBLOOM> :(
<Drakengarde> I'm thinking at least by the end of the day.
<MASTERLINKX> yes?
<vraiment> I don't go down there
<KanyeEast> it'll be on youtube within the hour
<jayands> I was
<mib_82ikkb> Brony State liiiiiiiiiiives!
<RAWRity> 26
<Lasharus> He looks ridiculous, but his look makes sense. His VA is fantastic.
<mib_xk44gc> i missed it?
<Celestianspirit> discord is awsome
<RoboPlop> Fits the show well.
<Winterwing> Poor Fluttershy...
<Scootaloo> I released Discord. Umad?
<arrakiz> that says all
<Kytoidomos> putcho game face on
<mib_0vh4qw> lucid-umm2 weeks
<Xerlith> Fluttershy's encounter was the best.
<DashOrCrash> ...oh
<mallam> 26 i think
<Wizzardess> Discord got rid of it.
<The_Mole> wonderful :)
<Euponytor> discord is just plain "Give the target audience nightmares"
<ButterBowl> too bad
<BronyFromAustralia> 24
<Windy> yes
<DrWhooves> Is the episode being replayed right now?
<brony4life> you're right lasharus *cries in corner*
<jayands> it*
<mib_iwaoz9> I like Nightmare Moon has a villain
<mib_2bs2g4> I agree Rainbrochillington, Discord is best villain.
<FreezeFrame> Yes, Percy, yess
<RainbroChillington> while I was nice and warm under my TS and Princess Celestia throw blanket
<Hellspawn> 0i live in germany
<DashOrCrash> to google images!
<Winterwing> NO FAIR FOR FLUTTERHSY!
<SBaraban> Derp.
<Rider> I wish they built up Discord's appearance instead of just dumping him onscreen but so far, I approve.
<AdamHammer> lol my friend says its a lil off scince its not faust
<SuperBrony64> Pony Time again!
<RainbroChillington> yes
<FreezeFrame> No, there's 26

<LeD> anyone knows how long they will be replaying it?
<APPLEBLOOM> DISCORD
<APPLEBLOOM> WHAT AN ASSHOLE
<mib_h5g8wk> He's in full Q mode here
<mib_juf0hy> not faust?
<mib_sllin0> Pony Q
*LordCelestia LOVES THIS PART
<AdamHammer> yes
<SAFR_> It would be like Zathura, as Discord and Q would merge into one
<Bjornfot> making sense is for pussies
<brony4life> love the laugh
<GaruuSpike> Q is a person in star trek who massively trolls the starfleet captains
<mib_0vh4qw> LOL
<Marfikent> and we will never see him again after ep2
<Kytoidomos> OH SHIT IT'S STARTED? OH NOOOO
<Blazingstorm> *sjudders*
<Windy> Does she?
<LeD> because I still haven't seen intro...
<eggmaster2029> you're in one
<mallam> 2 of them are the first 2
<jayands> ooooh yayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa yayaya
<RAWRity> Fluttershy is the personification of "love and tolerance" in that scene.
<mib_0vh4qw> disco ord
<Winterwing> Awesome vilain voice! 8D
<Euponytor> the wall art thing
<Jon> Also I love this part.
<xJenx> BACK FROM WATCHING LIVE.
<bishojo_kitsune> A spell only you can break? but it's like your horn
<FreezeFrame> The Discord 2-parter was done by the full S1 crew, while the other 24 were later.
<Windy> i thought she was out completely.
<Rare> Well, have a nice week everypony, see you next Saturday
<FwriedWrice> wonder when flankbook will be back up. I wanna post s**t
<SAFR_> hurray for replay

<AdamHammer> faust still writes it?
<VanillaBean> sjudders
<AllisZero> >YFW when the Hub has its highest ratings in history after this episode.
<mib_q99xvp> his laugh = epic
<glitch> hang on one sec, you start it again by pressing play?
<mib_iwaoz9> No, we wont
<thomsonr> dicord + troll = trollcord
<mib_l0b2p0> Did you miss me Jean Luc. I missed you
<SuperBrony64> Jon: Go under the Theater section
<mallam> first two are about discord
<Zatheyll1> Applejerk, Traitor-Dash, Flutterbitch, Rockity, now only missing Pinkie's
<mib_p2hkgd> Okay, the next episode will be on next Saturday.
<Dark_Horst> and still people wonder why he gets gonnected to q
<a041744> jon, type /join #roomname
<green> Discord doesn't need to make sense rider
<Blazingstorm> creepy stained glass discord...ugh
<RAWRity> Discord: YOU MAD PONY?
<Grundle> Yeah, he's basically playing Q
<Bynji> toomp
<xJenx> IT'S GLORIOUS :0
<mib_65freu> oh shit that 3d camera turn !
<GaruuSpike> He got bored and dimensionwarped to Equestria to troll the ponies
<vraiment> a kinda of robot?
<mallam> the rest are like normal episodes
<Dark_Horst> after hearing THIS?
<Zed_> Discord > All of the Chaos Gods.
<RoboPlop> Well for all we know, he gets turned to stone again.
<Bendyrulz> 0are they going to replay it after this?
<RainbroChillington> yeah she still writes sometimes
<mib_ny39ib> Celestia is pissed
<mib_lh33fz> But where is Luna?
<xJenx> I JUST WATCHED IT LIVE ON TV.
<mib_iwaoz9> They will defeat Discord and he wont be seen again
<mib_ci9coy> There's only room enough for one troll in Equestria
*SBaraban I LIKE THE PART WHERE CELESIA HAS WINGBONERS
<FreezeFrame> I believe this was supposed to be the S1 finale originally.
<RainbroChillington> she just stepped down as exec producer
<RAWRity> Fluttershy: No, not really
<AdamHammer> oh ok
<mib_p2hkgd> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<mib_2bs2g4> One question, what does he mean by "he doesn't turn ponies into stone"
<eggmaster2029> xd
<Sen> Celestia looks kinda pissed
<flutterdouche> more like distroll amirite?
<mib_l0b2p0> Dr. Whooves Vs Q
<RainbroChillington> But there's more than just her as exec producer
<The_Flyin_King> Discord is like halaster.
<mib_0vh4qw> yeah
<reddawn> faust was still the producer when this one was made
<DashOrCrash> Now he just needs to troll them by giving Twilight the powers of the Q
<Lucid294> Hmm, Pinkie Cry?
<APPLEBLOOM> i like how celestias hair moves even when theres no wind and shes not moving
<a041744> Discord is best villiam
<APPLEBLOOM> :3
<Dic> I love how Discord = Q, they got the perfect voice actor for it. Same kind of role =D
<mib_sit025> I miss Tarterus
<SBaraban> Hey, Y'all, Sniggidy Diggidy
<ProfesorRod> CHURRO!
<ProfesorRod> DumbRock, yes, she was
<ProfesorRod> Luna and Celestia defeated Discord
<Kytoidomos> Discord was turned into stone
<Nomikos> You think in such three-dimensional terms, Princess Celestia. How boring you've become
<Winterwing> No it wasn't, Freeze
<RainbowDash42> NO LESBIAN JOKES
<Sol> hi
<DashOrCrash> (temporarily)
<Lyokowarirtitan> rainbow dash proof glass

*SBaraban IM NOT TACKY
<SuperBrony64> OBEY.
<mib_9v3t8f> They're saying he's mean, he said that atleast he doesn't turn people to stone
<brony4life> tacky windows
<xJenx> Urrite.
<mib_sit025> Too bad its now lost to the warp
<mib_fpyik8> WHY IT KEEP STOPPING
<mib_ny39ib> But Pinkie is mad not sad
<RainbroChillington> yeah
<brony4life> tacky clouds
<Lucid294> Also, Rockity, FTW
<mib_mspmqo> Discord is /b/
<DashOrCrash> until she refuses the power, and saves the day
<mib_9v3t8f> you're welcome
<SeriousSeal> I'm tacky...
<brony4life> i see a pattern
<Winterwing> THey jsut had the first two episodes of season 2 done at the same time as the finale
<Dark_Horst> the hell is halaster
<mib_9v3t8f> BECAUSE YOUR NET SLOW
<Skydream> GOD SAVES FLUTTERSHY
<desertman> Well, time for me to check TvTropes.
<Axeldeath> Hai everyone
<mib_fpyik8> D:
<SBaraban> TEEHEE
<RainbroChillington> he doesn't turn them to stone
<Graffy_Hooves> de magecks
<Blazingstorm> although he does have all of the good qualities of an evil vvillan
<Winterwing> *They just*
<mib_1l29at> hes looks much better in the the windows than in person
<green> he also watches MLP
<mib_4b804l> FUCK THIS WON'T WORK
<The_Mole> it was lagging when i first got in here
<eggmaster2029> time for me to check dikekike
<KanyeEast> it sounds like lancey is having a good time
<mib_2bs2g4> Celestia is horrible, she put her sister in the moon and turned discord into stone.
<RoboPlop> Didn't Pinkie head outside?
<Rider> Is "turned to stone" going to become the new "banished to the moon"
<mib_sllin0> LOL
<APPLEBLOOM> lol
<Lyokowarirtitan> that face
<Blazingstorm> pinkie pie is soo crasy
<RAWRity> according to Jason, this was always meant os the s2 opener, but they were working on it on during s1
<EpicSaxPony> Walkman lol
<LanserT2> moooon walk
<APPLEBLOOM> dancing on twilights head
<RainbroChillington> OH COME ON
<vraiment> Pinky loves secretelly Discord
<mib_sllin0> ya
<Waifles> that moonwalking animation is hilarious
<Jon> Possiblly.
<Lyokowarirtitan> that fluttershy face
<RainbroChillington> DISCORD WAS EVIL
<thatoneguy> lol
<mib_p2hkgd> >They were both evil
<Maeni> Pinkie and Discord would get a long pretty well <3
<bar> Gosh I did NOT understand this episode
<brony4life> lol was he doing running man on her head?
<RainbroChillington> AND SO WAS NMM
<TwentyPrcntLessCool> dat moon walk
<thatoneguy> trollesetia
<mib_sit025> I wonder if the Farseer will return
<ThePretender> inb4 Celestia dubbed by Picard
<Lunafanatic> i lold
<Lyokowarirtitan> shall be my desktop
<Srake> Spoiler: Pinkie Pie is an agent of Discord.
<xJenx> Applejack is best Discordified.
<SmokeyTreble> she totally did
<RainbroChillington> >.<
<Grundle> Can't wait to see how this is resolved, and what implications it may have on the rest of the season
<mib_0vh4qw> pinkie is a TROLL
<interior_gummy> pinkie is best pony
<Euponytor> THAT's what that was
<MrChang> its not moonwalking
<NoPony> That's why she's called Trollestia.
<Blazingstorm> well duh
<Euponytor> THE RUNNING MAN
<RainbroChillington> Though I do love luna
<MrChang> its the running man
<DannyBrony> Pinkie Pie! Your so insane...
<flutterdouche> I need that gif of Discord shuffling
<bernd> moonwalk
<mib_572jjt> GASP
<Sola> Is this the BronyState server?
<TyeDyeBrony> @lovemeter Pinkiepie Discord
<mib_9v3t8f> Discord is awesome
<Wrek> 05thepretender omg yes
<SAFR_> that needs to be in a PMV too, Discord dancing on Twilight's head
<ProfesorRod> Pinkie x Discord OTP <3
<bar> The plot seems to have walked into a dead END
<Scootaloo> Lol discord doing the running man
<Bendyrulz> 0lol dancing on Twi's head
<SBaraban> Discord is a dick. I mean seriously.
<mib_q99xvp> "He's standing on your head!!
<Antarctic> ya i almost expected pinkie to separate from the pack
<BlueFlurries> I will be forever indebted to whoever makes a gif of Discord on Twi's head
<Sen> Is it wrong of me to think that Celestia is kinda hot?
<mib_lh33fz> Rainbow Dash all the way
<Axeldeath> Aww shit
<LiquidWolf> 0discorddancingontwilightshead.gif
<Lunafanatic> Celestia! Y U so serious?!
<Bendyrulz> 0no
<TyeDyeBrony> dang how'd that thing work?
<mib_avpbwe> what up bronies
<turncoat_pony> yes she is
<bar> I do not see any resolution
<DashOrCrash> I just got an Idea!!!
<DeathXP> I can't wait another week for episode two.
<AdamHammer> i feel that discord should also have been sent to mars
<The_Flyin_King> Everfree forest once again
<Flameshy> lol XD
<Windy> Discord is like "Q" from Star Trek.
<The_Si> Captain Jean Luc Celestia.
<thomsonr> we should place part 2 right here
<xJenx> lol
<thatoneguy> lunas cool
<mib_lh33fz> Teh maze!
<Whiskra> This episode is all Discord's.I think it's a shame that he'll be defeated next week to never return to the show. Before I would've been fine with this, but Discord is such a good character already they could and should make more episodes with him
<SeriousSeal> This episode is scary.. >_<
<mib_sit025> nope.avi
<AdamHammer> it farther than moon and everything
<DashOrCrash> Luna will show up and save the day!
<vraiment> it's a great villain
<ProfesorRod> no
<RainbroChillington> I'm between RD and TS
<Blazingstorm> i cant believe
<RAWRity> Seriously, this guy has an absolutely AWESOME voice. Fucking love him.
<Dic> Omg
<Cranberry_Scotch> Well, to be fair, Luna was being controlled by her super-powered evil side and Discord is just evil
<NewDCD> 9TyeDye: the bot is not active
<mib_9v3t8f> He IS q
<brony4life> it's totally running man NOT moonwalk
<thomsonr> nope.avi
<EpicSaxPony> Nope.avi
<SBaraban> 13HEY, TWILIGHT SPARKLE HERE
<vraiment> very good done
<mib_juf0hy> woah
<The_Flyin_King> oh
<The_Si> OF THE USS CANTERLOT.
<Dic> Celestia Song
<Grundle> I dunno
<brony4life> luna does moonwalk
<eggmaster2029> i want download link
<APPLEBLOOM> celestias
<Axeldeath> I want to watch this from the beginning
<SmokeyTreble> wha? totally not a labyrinth
<RainbroChillington> if you've read Past Sins, you probably love luna and TS
<DandyLion> Moonwalking Discord on Twilit's head = Me like
<DashOrCrash> she gets to be the hero this time!
<APPLEBLOOM> celestia
<FluttershyFan> first time this showed, it wouldnt even load, now on this replay i get no lag at all
<TyeDyeBrony> -_-
<bishojo_kitsune> what if she turned luna into stone
<mib_juf0hy> yeah hes alot like q
<mib_ci9coy> Be a annoying prankster? Turn into stone for 1000 years Trollestia
<vraiment> I didn't expected so much
<Windy> Sje
<mib_9v3t8f> Discord's favorite...is fluttershy
<Jon> I kind of hope hes at least mentioned
<APPLEBLOOM> JUST HELP THEM DAMMIT
<Flameshy> why must episode 2 be so far away
<The_Mole> the fate of equestria... is in your hooves
<Pinkamena> DashOrCrash: I want to believe
<Lasharus> Did Celestia just knight Twilight?
<AdamHammer> lol
<Bjornfot> >MFW THE LABYRINTH IS PLAYSET
<Grundle> Can't imagine the second episode living up to this one
<Unstoppabl3> HEYO
<green> I think fluttershy was right, they should have just went home
<thatoneguy> yeah lol
<Winterwing> She be trollin
<hero_spirit> Discord is just awesome.
<AllisZero> DashOrCrash: I actually think it's very likely
<Arfiol> I think I'm in love with discord
<Windy> She's just like "Nope"
<Spectrum> so why did she only knight twi?
<Dark_Horst> and now twilight is SIR twilight
*LordCelestia PONY RANGERS, MOVE OUT!
<mib_0vh4qw> haha
<powderedlightning> TITLE DROP
<LuckyLeaf> Excelent pointing of the obvious Twilight[
<GaPTrixie> yeah that gif would be hilarious, him doing a moonwalk on her head
<SBaraban> 0Derp
<Nomikos> hey, we don't know. maybe he'll be purified by the elements of harmony and become twilight's #3 assistant
<Winterwing> Not willing to help
<RainbroChillington> he is Q
<hero_spirit> SO AWESOME
<mib_enw2ei> Again?
<bar> Does Discord have a purpose?
<Lunafanatic> so do i!
<APPLEBLOOM> spolier=she looses her wings
<mib_iwaoz9> Celestia is so pointless
<thomsonr> twilight: its in the laberingh
<mib_9v3t8f> My little ponies...
<vraiment> Trollesta have been overthrown
<princessspring> poof
<RainbroChillington> he's the same voice actor
<Maeni> Discord just needs to be less mean spirited, then he and Pinkie would be the best pair evar
<thomsonr> nope.avi
<DumbRock> Twist and turns? OMG, it's Twist's fault!
<Blazingstorm> i cant believe RBD did that...
<bar> is he really completely evil?
<xJenx> lmfao
<Discord> Time to have fun ^_^
<mib_h4g3qs> Luna should come and save the day
<mallam> derp
<Windy> Yeah
<Drakengarde> Hedgemaze =/= labrynith
<brony4life> naked dash
<mib_e79pg0> NO MORE WINGBONERS
<APPLEBLOOM> spolier=they loose their horns
<mib_0ey09e> I hope they put in some kind of easily escapable Arkham equivalent
<Windy> Epic win
<DashOrCrash> She totally deserves that kind of thing
<thomsonr> AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
<ProfesorRod> discord is an A-grade troll
<xJenx> You gauise
<APPLEBLOOM> yep
<LordCelestia> DISCORD!
<RoboPlop> Remember, her cutie mark is the sun.
<mib_g4pb6y> rule 1 never cheat a hedge maze
<Waifles> Just think, all the Luna Fans are probably gonna treat Discord like he is some victim too
<AdamHammer> hes the same voice actor as q?
<Unstoppabl3> DOOD
<Jon> I'm curious at what the elements will do to him.
<mib_9v3t8f> THE FATE OF EQUESTRIA IS IN YOUR HOO-someone said that already
<Spectrum> No
<KanyeEast> Q wasn't a villian all the time on star trek, maybe he'll just stay on as Q did in trek
<MooMinded> Now where's the pony called turns?
<mib_9v3t8f> yes
<mib_juf0hy> is it the same voice actor for realz? thought i recocognized it
<ProfesorRod> I LOVE HIM!
<mib_0vh4qw> refresh time
<Nittany_Tiger> Everyone becomes a filthy earth pony!
<Kahrn> Hee twilight is adorable there
<mib_g4pb6y> it will kill you
<AllisZero> Twilight is cute when she's desperate
<mib_9v3t8f> Slow much?
<powderedlightning> DOPEY...DONT U MEAN DERPY
<BagofShenanigans> Discord reminds me of something you'd read about in the Phantom Tollbooth...
<Unstoppabl3> U THERE YAMI?
<RainbroChillington> oh calm down fluttershy
<Spectrum> Discord is an S-grade troll.
<mib_9v3t8f> Yes yes
<RoboPlop> She can't necessarily do anything else.
<The_Flyin_King> Applejack is the best ever in this case
<jayands> @bar, he's chaotic neutral
<mib_9v3t8f> It's him
<RAWRity> I LOVE THIS GUY
<RainbroChillington> you suck at flying anyway
<Unstoppabl3> DHBSHBFF
<VanillaBean> Funny how there's less lag now after half of the population here depleted
<flutterdouche> Then everyone was earth pony
<Hobbes> rauty & twilights little dance is the belt. lOL
<Blazingstorm> so regarding their reactions here
<Discord> And it was
<AdamHammer> lol
<LuckyLeaf> Are female knights also called "sir"?
<Winterwing> XD I like how Twilight had a more girly reaction than Rarity had! XD
<MrChang> kayne
<mib_juf0hy> haha eeeepic
<mib_l0b2p0> I think Discord was put there just to kill the Trollestia meme
<mib_ev2s0m> when did the brodcast start
<Nyst> Q was never a villain
<Zed_> Maybe he'll think they're just that fun and fix everything then pop in every now and again for giggles.
<Bendyrulz> 0those ponies need some more Red Bull
<mib_65freu> great evil laugh :3
<The_Mole> twilight went in a panic like pinkie when she thought there were bats on her face...
<interior_gummy> so we have liarjack, rainbow dodge, pissy pie, hoardity, and flutterbitch
<Jon> Q was just a prick who was basicaly god
<Ponynigma> Well that was fuckin' awesome you guys, haven't stayed up that late for something in quite some time.
<Maeni> Sheogorath :3
<thomsonr> MAI WINGS
<mib_q99xvp> troll Discord lol
<The_Mole> hah
*LordCelestia Where have you hidden the god damn elements discord!
<AdamHammer> i love this guy
<mib_pqyl62> being "purified" by the elements of harmony bans you from returning to the show
<The_Flyin_King> Applejack is the best earth ponys ever.
<SBaraban> 0Hey, Octavia, I was warned by dari. No need to kick.
<Maeni> his voice even reminds me of Sheogorath
<rivets> Discord broke Fluttershy, there is no forgiveness for this
<mib_p2hkgd> So now Rainbow Dash doesn't have wings due to the story, not because of artist mess-ups.
<thomsonr> YO HORN MA HORN
<Jon> ...Not a villain but just...kind of a prick.
<EarthTwighlit> Aww crap, no horn
<Dark_Horst> dunno
<vraiment> LOL
<GraffyHooves> it wasn't the moon walk it was the running man
<DashOrCrash> far less than half is gone
<thatoneguy> lol
<Lunafanatic> i think would react the same way as twilight and rarity if lost my horn
<EarthTwighlit> =P
<Lucid294> I love Discord. Shame we'll only see him in one more episode
<Drakengarde> No, they're called lady
<EpicSaxPony> I wonder how long it will take for someone to put this on Youtube.
<mib_9v3t8f> BAAAAAATS
<mib_65freu> bad touch
<ChipThe3rd> Douchecord.
<mib_h4g3qs> Nightmare moon Vs Discord
<MrChang> get yo booty into D&P
<mib_9v3t8f> BATS ON MY FACE
<Blazingstorm> shouldnt twilight and rarity have each other's reactions?
<Ratlan> I'm a Luna fan, but I'd like to see Discord punished worse than before.
<mib_sit025> its like Calvin Ball
<Kytoidomos> discord is pimp
<brony4life> female knights are "dame"
<Dark_Horst> ARE there female knights?
<Nyst> If he wanted to do anything villain-y, there'd be no way to stop him
<AdamHammer> i was expecting something like luna, like vengeful
<mib_mspmqo> we could have chocolate rain if they dont defeat discord...
<ProfesorRod> trololol
<mib_mcyqgi> i'm just waiting for picard and the enterprise to show up
<DashOrCrash> there was around 7-8 hundred
<Dic> Jon: And this doesnt match Discord how? XD
<Sol> Awwwwwww sheeee
<Maeni> I wonder if Discord has his own realm of madness
<xJenx> AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
<The_Flyin_King> Most skilled
<BagofShenanigans> A labrynth is a no flying zone :E
<mib_9v3t8f> Ooooh discord is saucy with her
<HolyCookie> No magic? but he can use it?
<Winterwing> Rarity rears, while Twilight looks like there was mice on the floor or something! XD
<mib_f9q14p> why is mine laggin so much?
<mib_q99xvp> yeahh
<brony4life> like "dame" judy dench
<AdamHammer> but i like this much better
<mib_9v3t8f> i thought FS was hsi fav
<Rider> Q was an annoyance but not a villain
<DashOrCrash> now there's 624
<HolyCookie> thats not fair...
<mib_mspmqo> i hope discord wins next episode
<VanillaBean> Well yeah, half is an exaggeration
<Spectrum> it's probably already up.
<FwriedWrice> omgomgomg my slow mind just connected it. Discord is the same actor as Star Trek's Q. Dam I'm slow
<SBaraban> 0SPOILERS: THEY DON'T HAVE EACH OTHER
<Octavia> 13Well;, I did
<Drakengarde> *shrug* Meh
<vraiment> I think Nightmare it's more powerful
<mib_juf0hy> discord could totally be the same q as in tng
<VanillaBean> But you get my drift
<Nomikos> i think Discord being impossible to /permanently/ defeat wouldn't be a bad moral for the show
<RAWRity> the best villains are always the ones who invade the heroes' personal space
<FAH> JUST BURN THE HEDGES! BURN THEM!
<tehepikbrony> thats what i was thinkin
<Discord> I'll tell you after everypony completes my next game
<Jon> I know
<The_Flyin_King> The most skilled earth pony is applejack, everypony else has magic or flying
<mib_0vh4qw> he a retarded mutant.
<mib_9v3t8f> It's lagging on mine too
<LuckyLeaf> Discord cheated. But then again, he is a being of chaos... or is it confusion?
<Grundle> Well, I'm approaching 24 hours of no sleep. Night, everypony. Text hugs and bro hoofs all around.
<Ratlan> Nightmare wasn't a real villain
<hero_spirit> Trollestia only fought him because she new she couldn't be top troll while he was around.
<EarthTwighlit> lol
<Waifles> Divide and Conquer
<Winterwing> BS!
<GaPTrixie> it looked moonwalky but you're probably right
<mib_9v3t8f> because you no have 10 mbps
<Octavia> 13No colors, you know better.
<brony4life> look at pinkie
<Spectrum> ^
<thomsonr> FAIL
<Vis> trololol
<Arfiol> Well, he is a troll...
<mib_lh33fz> owned..
<Bunni> HOW DO I WATCH THIS FROM THE BEGINNING
<Dark_Horst> YOU NOTICED THAT JUST NOW?
<Antarctic> gotta be a sonic zone or summat
<tehepikbrony> too late
<mib_p2hkgd> OH LOOK, THEY'RE NOT TOGETHER NOW DOHOHOHO
<LuckyLeaf> denied
<flutterdouche> Psyke!
<jayands> The third rule is, if this is your first night, you HAVE to play
<SlurryMoon> Discords a cool cat..... pony, dragon, thing
<Kencolt> well.. I'm out already seen, and finally after 20 hours, getting sleepy.
<thatoneguy> hopefully luna is on the next episode
<mib_0ey09e> Janeway was more villanous than Q
<DashOrCrash> *brohoof*
<AdamHammer> separation!
<mib_avpbwe> 0 lag bitchs
<LiquidWolf> 0poor Fluttershy... again
<mallam> lol fail so much for together
<shadowLurker> NO
<Blazingstorm> TOGETHER!oops...
<Euponytor> pinkie is TRAPPED
<AdamHammer> its super effective!
<Lunafanatic> *brohoof*
<mib_9v3t8f> you have 1 mbps more or less
<Tsuki> Night Grundle!
<Dark_Horst> it's been all over ponobooru fopr DAYS
<Sol> Discord: nope.avi
<a041744> TV tropes sure updates fast :D
<Zed_> Draconaquis
<RoboPlop> Joan of Arc was a knight, right?
<Cranberry_Scotch> Mine won't even start

<Srake> Applejack is not a good liar...
<Winterwing> Dem plots! XD
<IkeJager> This is Pinkamina Ultra-Lite
<mib_9v3t8f> DarkROOK IS WIN

<Euponytor> this part is pure Needful Things
<Dark_Horst> didja see that ground?
<The_Mole> i think i got it
<mib_juf0hy> Hm, i guess what happens is that he makes them doubt a little bit and then hypnotizes them after "cracking their armor"
<The_Flyin_King> Applejack is honest though
<flutterdouche> GOD I LOVE DISCORD
<SBaraban> 0Derpy Hooves is said to return in season 2 according to one of the animators on the show. She has gained a scripted-character status rather than an arbitrary background pony, and she is considered a "Where's Waldo"-type challenge for the fans
<VanillaBean> I wonder how Discord will convert Twilight.
<FreezeFrame> Oh, Flutterbitch's voice?
<shadowLurker> yeah, because before AJ never lied...
<Arfiol> Trololol
<thatoneguy> oh rarity you bitch
<SBaraban> 0inb4 boulder

<brony4life> bye
<Daginni> Now, off to watch THE LION KING in theaters, I swear I am such a kid at heart. :P
<KanyeEast> you know, thinking about it. maybe nightmare moon got her idea of trying to discourage the mane cast FROM disord
<TwilightSparkle> oh and mods you rock!!
<RoboPlop> I wonder where those elements of harmony came from then.
<ProfesorRod> as a kitsune I can vouch to that >:3
<The_Lobe> Bronystate is credit to team
<Maeni> what does OTP mean?
<NickelSpecter> hi
<Lasharus> Thanks for the hard work for this stream BronyState. Very much enjoyed it :)

<jayands> mfw*
<Antarctic> i will stick to rarity theater
<Owlowiscious> Hoo!
<MASTERLINKX> i wonder if they'll play it twice next week too
<DashOrCrash> I still think that Space CoreXSpace is best pairing
<CharCustomZakuPony> It just ended
<ThePretender> I'm glad that I could watch the repeat with BronyState, it's just not the same without you guys.
<LeD> 2-3 Hours and we have this online on YT
<Soup_or_man> now to read a hundred forum pages about this episode :p
<Sol> Lyra is overpowerred
<SAFR_> She's really more of a bitch
<filleg> Lol
<The_Mole> longest week? im reminded of the week before bioshock was released
<GaPTrixie> she seemed to think things were already out of hand but maybe she just didn't want to be corrupted by Discord
<filleg> xD
<Antarctic> otp is one true pairing
<mib_5r0n57> it's now midnight
<ProfesorRod> One True Pair
<Owlowiscious> Hoo hoo

<The_Mole> that was what it was like for me...
<SmokeyTreble> Nah, Trixie is appropriatelypowered
<mib_lh33fz> But this is moar inportend
