<Kencolt> Like I said, after having my hip replaced, well, I figure if I can get past that you'll be okay! <3
<dshannon> oh shiiiit
<Meeplord> :)
<TheOrwellianBastion> The thought of having a hip replacement scares me
<Dynamic_Brony> Not the Chainsaw
<TheOrwellianBastion> Do they actually cut into your thigh and remove the bones?
<RoboGerbil> random kung fu skills
<Meeplord> Wait WHAR'
<DeadlyDerp3> Well, 40 minutes in this 30 minute program, he finally transforms

<Dynamic_Brony> RE4 got interesting

<DeadlyDerp3> Does that make me cyborg?
<Kencolt> Not really-- I was totally unconcious when tyhey did it.
<Zappy> Kencolt: Wow, that doesn't sound pleasant at all.
<PinkiePieCopy> Wait, he was made into a cyborg IRL?
<NewBLACK> 09,01WHY DIDN'T THIS HAPPEN IN MY RE4 PLAYTHROUGH

<Dashie_Dashie> NewBlack, are you the one that has Fist of the North star >_<?
<PinkiePieCopy> Screw this...
<Kencolt> DeadlyDerp3: Actually, this is a regular tyhing, for kids in Japan to call older teens "Big Brother" or "Big Sister" even if notrelated.
<DeadlyDerp3> Please, I wanna watch something in english
<DeadlyDerp3> ...It's stupid -3- The japanese are STUYPID
<Dynamic_Brony> Totally forgot about my Science Fair tomorrow

<dshannon> DeadlyDerp3 you're stupid and ignorant
<DeadlyDerp3> You are stupid and Ignorant :P
<PinkiePieCopy> DeadlyDerp3: So, since they ivented anime and manga, our ponies would not exist
<PinkiePieCopy> If they were not here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Soo...Japanese zombies.

<TheOrwellianBastion> and Manga is awesome
<alexxm> and thank them for than TheOrwellianBastion
<TheOrwellianBastion> I am forever grateful to the Japanese for Anime.
<Dark__Horst> the japanese in this room is reaching critical levels
<PinkiePieCopy> DeadlyDerp3: Yous hould be greatful. Without japanise, NO PONIES.
<Meeplord> Im not a big anime fan
<DeadlyDerp3> ...When does his bike ever get involved with a fight?
<TheOrwellianBastion> Even though it was an american cartoon that inspired the creation of Japanese Anime
<Dynamic_Brony> :);):D:(:O
<DeadlyDerp3> I WAS KIDDING
<DeadlyDerp3> Jeeezz
<PinkiePieCopy> Meeplord: Ponies are anime
<otakon> brb
<Dken2021> wasn't ponies american made?
<Meeplord> ik
<RoboGerbil> cant comment on the action as well, gotta pay attention to the movie, the subtitles and the chat room
<Kencolt> Kamen Rider is a TOkusatsu series based on works by Ishinomori. It's now quite the same as Super Sentai, adapted here as Power Rangers.
<DeadlyDerp3> Friendship is copyright of friendship American :P
<Meeplord> Its bout the only anime I watch
<PinkiePieCopy> Dken2021: The style of ponies is anime
<TheOrwellianBastion> Scrooge Mcduck Inspired the creator of Astro Boy
<alexxm> pull my finger
<CriticKitten> <PinkiePieCopy> Meeplord: Ponies are anime <--- lolno
<Meeplord> Used to watch Naruto LONG time ago
<DeadlyDerp3> He was drawing tentacle hentai :P
<RoboGerbil> quick the subway phones rining
<DeadlyDerp3> OH SNAP< WENT THERE
*PinkiePieCopy falcon PAWNCHes CriticKitten
<Meeplord> lol
<PinkiePieCopy> Don't correct me. I'm right and you celestiadamn know it.
<RoflBot> hehe
<DeadlyDerp3> Another furry
<LadyCanary> ...Holy CRAP.
<RoboGerbil> lol falco
<CriticKitten> Except you're not
<Shisno-brony> wtf
<PinkiePieCopy> I am
<Dark__Horst> BIRRRRRRRRRRRD
<otakon> and then big bird mosnter
<CriticKitten> That term refers to Japanese animation.
<Kencolt> Actually, from a Japanese perspective, all animation is Anime.
<Zappy> OHAI Mutant!
<DeadlyDerp3> "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
<CriticKitten> Ponies are not Japanese.
<kenne88> dat backround face
<DeadlyDerp3> ...I don't see anything
<NewBLACK> 09,01this show, a furry holocaust?
<RoboGerbil> all the homies say ho and the girlies wanna scream
<PinkiePieCopy> They use the STYLe of anime
<CriticKitten> That's irrelevant.
<alexxm> well the subway molesters are getting creative
<TheOrwellianBastion> Without Carls Bark, An american animator, Anime wouldn't exist.
<DeadlyDerp3> "Bwwwl"
<CriticKitten> By your logic, Avatar is anime too. >_>
<TheOrwellianBastion> Avatar is an anime
<DeadlyDerp3> "Huh? Let me paint that, QUICK"
<Dark__Horst> BIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRD
<CriticKitten> (and before you say it, no, it's not anime either)
<TheOrwellianBastion> Avatar, THE LAST AIRBENDER.
<TheOrwellianBastion> YEAHHH
<DeadlyDerp3> "AAAAeeee"
<Ajack_85> where is gonzilla when we need him
*PinkiePieCopy punches CriticKitten
<Dark__Horst> aaaarglblblblblbl
<Zappy> The light, it burns!
<DeadlyDerp3> That's just silly :P
<PinkiePieCopy> By your logic, nothing is anime
<CriticKitten> lolwrong
<Kencolt> Actually, Tezuka, was more influenced in his style with earlier Disney works.
<DeadlyDerp3> OKAY GUYS
<DeadlyDerp3> Let's just agree anime is awesome :P
<TheOrwellianBastion> but without DISNEY, anime wouldn't exist
<Zappy> anime is anime. 6_9
<PinkiePieCopy> CriticKitten: Ponies use a remix of anime, or manga.
<DeadlyDerp3> ...and the guy with the tissue robes is right
<CriticKitten> You're not getting it.
<TheOrwellianBastion> Kencolt:
<CriticKitten> The style is irrelevant.
<kenne> mfw you can only take pictures for gamerpics with classic cam :[
<CriticKitten> The location is.
<RoboGerbil> anyone else buffering horribly?
<TheOrwellianBastion> Pshhh
<PinkiePieCopy> Anime is a type of drawing
<PinkiePieCopy> so is manga
<Kencolt> I am-- buffering on this episode seems to be rather ahrsh.
<Dark__Horst> somehwat. it's a bit laggy
<alexxm> am i the only one who finds this hilarious
<PinkiePieCopy> You do not get it CriticKitten
<CriticKitten> The term is generally used to refer to animation of a Japanese origin, which ponies are not. :p
<Zappy> RoboGerbil: a couple lag here and there...
<otakon> Kencolt: same here.
*PinkiePieCopy punches CriticKitten
<PinkiePieCopy> SHUT UP
<CriticKitten> No, you're using the fancy art terminology rather than the normal person terminology.
<TheOrwellianBastion> Word usageIn Japan, the term anime does not specify an animation's nation of origin or style; instead, it serves as a blanket term to refer to all forms of animation from around the world.[17][18] English-language dictionaries define anime as "a Japanese style of motion-picture animation" or as "a style of animation developed in Japan
<DeadlyDerp3> except the giant Eagle right there, No nothing suspicous
<alexxm> he was dressed as a eagle
<PinkiePieCopy> We do not need adictionary
<PinkiePieCopy> We need
<PinkiePieCopy> PONIES
<RoboGerbil> lol no reporter would say monster on tv
<Kencolt> Although Aniime styles wander ALL OVER THE PLACE, so trying to define it stylistically is implausible.
<CriticKitten> Regardless, I'm curious where the Japanese style of art is present in ponies, myself.
<jffry890> whats this now?
<DeadlyDerp3> "AAAH"
<Shisno-brony> bronies im new to this. in 2 days and 23 hours will be new MLP episode ?
<DeadlyDerp3> So the furry eagle is a Disney Representative?
<jffry890> no friday movie night
<jffry890> no new episode for 2 weeks
<kenne> no just friday stream
<DeadlyDerp3> Trying to elimenate Japan?
<PinkiePieCopy> In their eyes, CriticKitten
<TheOrwellianBastion> Big eyes are not exclusive to Anime, since it was borrowed from an American cartoon. Therefor Ponies is not anime.
<CriticKitten> Last I looked, it was pretty much based around ordinary Flash-style artwork.
<Zappy> Shisno-brony: new episode on Saturday.
<RoboGerbil> here comes the pervert kidnapper
<PinkiePieCopy> WHO CARES
<DeadlyDerp3> Well, this ain't stupid :P
<kenne> Zappy: yeah i thought so too
*Kipkat07 is back from his after skool nap
<TheOrwellianBastion> PinkiePieCopy: But the style of the eyes was borrowed from a disney cartoon.
<Dark__Horst> jffry890: i think you've got your weeks confused, the ponyless weekend is over and ther will be an episode this saturday
<TheOrwellianBastion> Therefor it is not anime
<CriticKitten> You'll have to explain that, since the eyes do NOT remind me of anime and I watch quite a bit of that.
<Zappy> Hello Kipkat07. Had a nice nap?
<DeadlyDerp3> ........................................ANIME IS DISNEY, AND DISNEY IS ANIME
<dr-whooves> damn this looks like porn
<Kipkat07> eeyup
*Snuffsis[A] is now away - Reason : Auto-Away after 30 minutes
<dr-whooves> just got dafuq is this
<NewBLACK> 09,01...who gives a shit. Animation is animation.
<CriticKitten> Unless you intend to argue that expressive eyes are anime.
<CriticKitten> :p
<PinkiePieCopy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3abMUH_P1E&feature=player_detailpage is my reaction to CriticKitten and I's argument
<DeadlyDerp3> Well, this is just getting STUPID
<CriticKitten> DCD: Agreed, personally.
<Tovler> In America, Japanese Animation is anime, and I'm speaking as an American
<RoboGerbil> lol furry fight
<NewBLACK> 09,01"Anime" is a shortened way of saying "Animation". SO YEAH.
<otakon> eeyup
<DeadlyDerp3> Well, that was fast
<TheOrwellianBastion> My reaction to this whole conversation about Anime http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3y3QoFnqZc

<RoboGerbil> state of the art right there
<DeadlyDerp3> Nice to include the evil organ player in the back there :P
<CriticKitten> PinkiePieCopy: You really need to chill
<Meeplord> Back
<PinkiePieCopy> CriticKitten: NewBLACK said anime is short for animation, making MLP an animation
<PinkiePieCopy> Argument won
<Zappy> Do I need to say it? SCIENCE.
<DeadlyDerp3> You don't need to say hello to the victim
<RoboGerbil> we brought the girl for our bukakke fest
<CriticKitten> You're getting offended over a simple disagreement.
<CriticKitten> It's kind of childish.
<PinkiePieCopy> Explain how i'm offended
<Mutterguy> Godzira?
<CriticKitten> Relax and just have fun with it. :p
<Meeplord> That organs gettin annoyin
<Meeplord> lol
<TheOrwellianBastion> ROFL
<DeadlyDerp3> Playing missle comand in the background :P
<CriticKitten> Wasn't aware we were arguing. Pretty sure I was discussing how the term is generally used, I dunno what you were doing but I was just enjoying a discussion.
<RoboGerbil> hes got LSD?
<TheOrwellianBastion> DeadlyDerp3: Missle command is awesome
<Meeplord> pillz here
<TheOrwellianBastion> DeadlyDerp3: I could spend 10 hours on missle command
<Zappy> Supa Computa!
<Mutterguy> I was afk for a bit.. what's going on??
<PinkiePieCopy> CriticKitten: I SHALL PROOVE I WON THIS VIDEO WITH A PONYMON BATTLE
<DeadlyDerp3> ...Why does he need to kidnap people who would volunteer for this?!
<Meeplord> WHOS THAT PONYMON
<DeadlyDerp3> and with a falcon, no less!
<Meeplord> ITS :[
<RoboGerbil> now thats a high def tv, oh wait its just displaying text
<CriticKitten> See, perhaps that's the problem.
<Mutterguy> is this japanese Johnny 5 is alive?
<Shisno-brony> this movie just :D
<alexxm> because it amuses him DeadlyDerp3
<CriticKitten> You're overly concerned about "winning" an opinionated discussion on IRC.
<DeadlyDerp3> ...Well, it amuses me...by making me cry in hate :(
<CriticKitten> Just chill, bro. :p
<DeadlyDerp3> "dwaaaaaahhaa"
<PinkiePieCopy> I still want a ponymon battle

<Capn_fisty> Drawfriend!!
<DeadlyDerp3> "This is a FREE fansub will be right back"
<CriticKitten> RoboGerbil: What good will a wet t-shirt contest do when ponies are wearing t-shirts?
<Mutterguy> why then.. does she have a sticking plaster on her head
<RoboGerbil> who said anyhting about ponies, critickitten, i was commenting on the feed
<Kencolt> Historically, drowning yourself was a popuar way to commit suicide in Japan, since for centuries most Japanese did not know how to swim. True history!
<CriticKitten> Pft.
<Mutterguy> oh it's gone.. I swear she had one
<DeadlyDerp3> She was only in the water for a few minutes
<CriticKitten> But my comment was better when you assumed it was ponies.
<CriticKitten> It meant that people were making mental pictures of Twi in a wet t-shirt.
<CriticKitten> (have fun with that one!)
<Mutterguy> Screw the girl! I have money!
*Phase4 is back

<kenne> Dken2021: yeah...sounds like they are finally running out of colors
<Jim> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urnUYQt-9bc
<Tovler> I hope Black and White 2 is a sequel and you get to play as N (a character who is clearly high-functioning autistic and must be censored)
<Dken2021> and for some reason black kyurem and white kyurem are separate pokemon and not forms
<OneTrickPony> today has been derpy :P
<Dken2021> ohai there OneTrickPony
<Jim> I haven't really followed Pokemon after gold/silver, were they any good after that?
<Jim> ohai OneTrickPony

<Tovler> Derpy should sing a pony version of the Humpty Dance.
<Beach_Creamz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk&feature=related
<Ingwaz> Jim: to my knowledge, up to black and white thye were good, black and white had crappy pokemon but apparently a really good story
<Dken2021> 3rd gen changed the game engine a little, 4th gen changed it alot (and was slow), and 5th gen changed the pacing of the story
<Tovler> Jim. If you're in to battling, then the game is better than ever. If you only care about the story, then No.

<Jim> chat derped
<Yahooz> Mfw Phase4 and Phase5 are two different people
<Dken2021> am I'm hipster enough to only have played Cool boarders 4?
<Phase5> I am Phase4's father
<Jim> Phase4's father, are you space?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I played Army Men! I am the 133735t hipster!
<Yahooz> Phase5 is Phase4's son
<LadyCanary> Filthy, scummy HIPSTERS.
<Yahooz> obvi
<Phase5> I guess that makes more sense
<Yahooz> lol Hipsters
<Kipkat07> My responce to Derpy being cancelled: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WRXcqLufmI&feature=related
<Yahooz> Fun Fact, Being hipster is conformist. WHAT NOW!!
<Jim> When being hipster becomes mainstream, what's a hipster?
<Kipkat07> fun fact: the stamps in Isreal are 100% kosher
<Yahooz> Exactly
<Dken2021> a neo hipster
<Phase5> thats just being ironic
<Tovler> Yahooz: You can believe what you want to believe. I'll believe my own thing.
<LadyCanary> I find it funny that so many people wear those big hipster glasses without the lenses to look cool.
<Yahooz> Yeah that is always hilarious to watch
<TopHat> lol I wear those as a joke
<LadyCanary> Sucks for them because then you can poke em in the eyes easier for being so stupid.
<Kipkat07> i like hipsters. they stand for originality
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I know this band called Santana. You probably never heard of them~
<Jim> I'm so hipster that I am conformist of irony alone
<Yahooz> T_T
<TopHat> I walk around with them and make hipster jokes all day
<Kipkat07> indie rock?
<Jim> Hipster jokes are fun ^^
<CCCP> Hipsters are fine.
<Dken2021> "What if majority of bronies are just hipsters and only watching the show ironically?"
<LadyCanary> The kid I like wears hipster-esque glasses. But he actually needs them to SEE.

<Yahooz> so a hipster walks into a bar... but then walks straight out when everyone already knows about it
<Kipkat07> lool

<Tovler> Gentrification and urban gentrification refer to the changes that result when wealthier people ("gentry") acquire or rent property in low income and working class communities.

<MahBoi777> NOONE TAKES MAH FOOD:|
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: well, I'm sure it's porbably been brought up already, but the problem some may have had migth have been because of RD's dialogue.
<Placebo> LadyCanary: Is "derp" even a verb?
<IngloriousPony89> airin6ixx: Son, I am dissaspoint
*fillyfillyy is disgusted by mario_pony " TopHat will you take care of that lil filly for me"

<LadyCanary> It can be.
<mario_pony> Placebo: yes it is!
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtKlSy1O5GY What did I just find?
<RAWRity> Derp has no boundaries.

<RAWRity> Placebo: it will be in the form of a censor bar
*MahBoi777 throws a star at mario_pony
*TopHat throws the remote at mario_pony
<Tovler> Terry Crews has less boundaries than Derpy.
<MahBoi777> *troll face*
<TheHoodyninja> Derpy can see into your SOUL!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> or just the dialogue as a whole ?
*Placebo throws MahBoi777 at mario_pony
*Derpy_Hooves catches the star
*mario_pony dodges
<sirwilliam> derpy can see into your soul!
*TheHoodyninja wonders where my star is
<MahBoi777> u cannot dodge me, I am huge
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: eeyup. While I disagree, the way RD's dialogue was delivered, it could be interpreted that she was in some way "bullying" Derpy.
<airin6ixx> My atempt on my friend failed. I guess ill try my GF
<fillyfillyy> TopHat: are you not gonna take care of mario_pony for your special somepony?
<sirwilliam> im on a phone its a miracle im even typing this fast...

<IngloriousPony89> So much action between filly, TopHat, and mario
<Jim> Faster than the speed of poni
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> interesting~ yet unlikely ~
<RAWRity> personally, I just see it as somebody who knows how Derpy is, and RD just not being the most patient of ponies, but I can understand how somebody might come to that conclusion.
<Tovler> Nopony drops anvils like Derpy
<sirwilliam> it helps that im on a good phone with a qwerty keyboard
<Jim> The science show.
<fillyfillyy> but now you have to go get it...wait i get to see you walk away... ok go ahead and throw everything at him and get our stuffs back TopHat
<mario_pony> TopHat: now i have a remote
<flutter_spin> ..... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bxTWWl2g5Q&feature=channel Where have you been? I'm moving that link upfront!
<IngloriousPony89> If only all of the idiotic parents that complained about Derpy shared your thoughts RAWRity.
<RAWRity> I still feel that altering the scene as they did was unnecessary and a detractment from the show and the scene, but at least I can sort of play devil's advocate to some degry.
<TheHoodyninja> Jim: oh i get it, cuz Drops a piano on Twilight!

<fillyfillyy> ummm RainbowJack im kinda with my wifu right now
<TheHoodyninja> I has a gay cousin, im cool with anything
<Gunthler> guys how do i know if its tornado weather, thats what im fearing :(
<mario_pony> IngloriousPony89: maybe you could just go in and just buy the toys?
<RainbowJack> aahhh
<Polydunami> Gunthler, where do you live?
<MahBoi777> I can't disarm it!
<Gunthler> MO
<Polydunami> Oh
<flutter_spin> $1.75 for just the toy
<sirwilliam> simply tab into weather.com...
<Gunthler> really close to the Kansas state line
<Polydunami> Just wondering, I know nothing about tornado weather
<IngloriousPony89> mario_pony: You can actually get just the toy without buying anything else?
<TheHoodyninja> Gunthler: Well if you look outside youll see a giant black spinning funnel, thats when you run
<fillyfillyy> hey TopHat meet my friend RainbowJack
<IngloriousPony89> In the meal I mean
<sirwilliam> youll be good if anything ugly comes up
<mario_pony> IngloriousPony89: yep i think
<flutter_spin> IngloriousPony89: yes
<SaxyPretender> 0,14storms? that's definately Nittany_Discord's territory
<Ingwaz> yeah, when the toys are released at mcdonalds, i will be buying several of each one
<RoflBot> we're going to watch raiders of the lost ark at friday ^^
<MahBoi777> Polydunami: allow me to explain *ahem*
<TopHat> hello RainbowJack
<Polydunami> No need
<IngloriousPony89> And MACHETE! God I cant freakin' wait!!
<Polydunami> Reallly
<flutter_spin> But I think you can only buy max 2 per day
<RainbowJack> hello there tophat
<IngloriousPony89> Best. Move night. EVER!
<MahBoi777> Polydunami: I insist
<fillyfillyy> umm RJ he isnt just tophat he is TopHat
<flutter_spin> That's ok, they are releasing 2 per cycle
<Polydunami> Don't
<Jim> I hate it when my chat derps
<MahBoi777> Tornadoes occur when cold dry air moves above warm moist air. Cold air is more dense than warm air so the cold air drops and the warm air rises. The cold air falling is similar to the water in the bathtub draining.
<fillyfillyy> tophat is just a hat TopHat is TopHat
<flutter_spin> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rB9MENyufkc/T0v1Fy2OeTI/AAAAAAAAgx4/NIGRH08t51E/s1600/1.JPG
<RainbowJack> TopHat sorry i just woke uo and its 5:30 here
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> use mirc ?
<sirwilliam> that toy rstriction, pricing, and other toy factors very wildly across different mcds
<MahBoi777> It creates a cyclone effect. Tremendous volumes of hot and cold air equalizing creates tremendous winds.That is a pretty unscientific answer.
<fillyfillyy> 11:30 here
<flutter_spin> well ok, http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/more-in-depth-look-from-canadian.html is a better link
<TheHoodyninja> Well my laptops about to lose power and the charger wont work right now so good night everyone
<MahBoi777> gnight TheHoodyninja
*TheHoodyninja passes out
<sirwilliam> wow that sucks gnite
<IngloriousPony89> Goodnight TheHoodyninja
<Jim> night TheHoodyninja
<Polydunami> As far as I know, MLP only airs on TreehouseTV in Canada
<Polydunami> We don't get The Hub
<flutter_spin> kitty! :_)
<MahBoi777> EGAD
<Jim> I don't have the hub over here either
<RainbowJack> was TOY_PON32 on today or last night?
<sirwilliam> i just got the hub at my house.
<Ingwaz> flutter_spin: i worked at a mcdonalds for about 3.5 years some time ago and i never heard that we could only sell a certain amount of toys per day to a person
<mario_pony> i can get the hub but my mom doesn't want to !
*Jim shrugpony
<MahBoi777> nope TT_TT
*RainbowJack hugs Jim "me 2"
<flutter_spin> Sry Ing. It might only be if the toy is popular...
<Polydunami> And I don't really think TreehouseTV is a very good network if it has to censor the word 'loser' in its shows
<mario_pony> sirwilliam: luvky
<Ingwaz> lol, well flutter_spin with the mlp toys, you can bet they'll be quite popular
<mario_pony> sirwilliam: *lucky
<sirwilliam> i even expanded my cable package just to get the hub
<TopHat> oh sorry
<TopHat> I'm here
<IngloriousPony89> Well this is a first. It's thundering at the end of winter.
<flutter_spin> My mom was a manager at Mcdonalds. She told me they had to limit the toy selling sometimes
*fillyfillyy falls asleep on TopHat's shoulder
<MahBoi777> my bulldog be chewin on mah foot......I've taught you well.
<mario_pony> sirwilliam: we have to do that too it's just my dosn't want to pay more
<Gunthler> scaredddd
<TopHat> you did that
<Ingwaz> i could get the hub, but its an extra $8 a month for me, and money isnt something i have a ton of, not to mention i dont get to pick which episodes i want to watch on tv
<Polydunami> Dang it, I live in Vancouver where most of the cast is based. We should at least have The Hub as an option
<Gunthler> :l
<MahBoi777> hello Gunthler
<sirwilliam> i did it because im in charge of cable at my house
<flutter_spin> Just watch on bronystate :P or when Xyro uploads 1080p
<mario_pony> sirwilliam: seriously why?
<Polydunami> That's what I'm doing nowadays
<Ingwaz> flutter_spin: could very well be, but, if i go in early in the morning during breakfast time, then go back in after my classes are all finished at around 4:30, i doubt they'll know its me
*fillyfillyy snores really loud on TopHat s ear
<MahBoi777> he who has the remote controls all
<Placebo> I ate to much ;.;
<TopHat> O_o
<sirwilliam> i live with a brother and friend
<TopHat> loud
<Jim> The great holder of the remote control is all mighty
<mario_pony> sirwilliam: lucky
<Polydunami> I'm here on BronyState because I can't watch the new episodes live anywhere else
<Ingwaz> and its mcdonalds, theres far too many of them around as is, i can always go to one thats probably at most, a mile away
<Polydunami> Well, I can, but I like it here
<sirwilliam> so we call the shots together
<flutter_spin> yeah. I just know it as a possibility. I don't know the rules of McD
<Jim> All you have to do is asking them if they'd be willing to sell some of their toys
*RainbowJack hugs Polydunami
<Polydunami> Umm
<Polydunami> Hi?
*Polydunami hugs RainbowJack back
<IngloriousPony89> Where do you live Ingwaz? The closest McDonalds here is 15 miles away
<Ingwaz> i plan on getting a couple of sets of the toys, one for myself, and possibly sell a set or two as a collection
<Polydunami> Oh my
<MahBoi777> Don't stop me noooowwwww
<fillyfillyy> (dreams of TopHat having enough gentlycoltly courtisy as to take me up to a bed so im not sleeping on the couch but of course its just a dream)
<Placebo> I have a McD's within walking distance >.>
<CupcakeWarrior> So were talking about the mcdonalds toys then?
<TopHat> subtle hint
<IngloriousPony89> Eeyup
<Polydunami> MahBoi777, that reminds me of a genius movie
<Randomnerd> Friday, yeah?
<Ingwaz> IngloriousPony89: i prefer not to say generally, but i know theres a mcdonalds a few miles from my university, and another one maybe 8 mintues away from that one
<mario_pony> oh god that creepy guy from that show CDC was showing us is still in my screen
<Jim> The closes McDonalds is a 600 kilometers drive from where I live
<MahBoi777> Placebo: u lucky boi
<sirwilliam> i would probably buy both the transformers and ponies because theyre both relevent to me.
<Randomnerd> Frideh, Frideh, gotta get down on Frideh
*TopHat carries fillyfillyy up to HER bed
<Polydunami>
<LadyCanary> o3o
<Placebo> >saxy music
<Ingwaz> Randomnerd: its not friday
<Randomnerd> Ingwaz: so they're out now?
<LadyCanary> ...Ohhh myyyy Placebo.
<fillyfillyy> ('subtle' hint to other ponies)
<Ingwaz> Randomnerd: what? when did i say that?
<flutter_spin> I drive to work. I pass 3 McDonalds. It is a 10minute drive.
<MahBoi777> (\/) (o,,,,o) (\/)
<Placebo> Don't look!
<Polydunami> The closest Mickey D's to where I live is about 2-3km away
*Placebo covers LadyCanary's eye
<Polydunami> Maybe 4km
<Polydunami> And I don't give a damn
<Randomnerd> Whatever.
<MahBoi777> THE HORROR
<Randomnerd> I'll get 'em next week.
*fillyfillyy stirs in TopHat s arms but doesnt wake up
<Ingwaz> there are no mcdonalds near where i live, but i go to uni 5 days a week, so i can get it before or after class
<CupcakeWarrior> My nearest mcdonalds is a five minute walk
<Polydunami> The thing is, I prefer food over McDonald's
<MahBoi777> hey Cupcakeman
<Ingwaz> i dislike mcdonalds...
<herostar> hey guys, im recording for youtube. can anyone do a livestream soon?
<Polydunami> Actually, I remember having their fries in China
<Ingwaz> their food is generally disgusting
*RainbowJack sincker "oh boy TopHat Fillyfillyy seems to be asleep
<Polydunami> They were not greasy in the slightest
<IngloriousPony89> That one McDonalds is probably the only one within a 40 mile radius. Jesus, I really do live in the middle of nowhere :P
<mario_pony> brb gotta help mom with her homework
<CupcakeWarrior> I dont think mcdonalds is even food
<IngloriousPony89> ^
<herostar> odd chat for a video for youtube.. perhaps i was unheard?
<CupcakeWarrior> Its probably just sewage
<Ingwaz> IngloriousPony89: i live in a pretty small town area myself, i just go to a university in a slightly more populated town
<MahBoi777> it's not, it's genetically modified
<Polydunami> Hey herostar, give it your best shot
<flutter_spin> herostar: We don't usually have stream going right now. Mostly we talk about random stuff, like the McD MLP set
<herostar> GUYS SAY HI TO YOUTUBE
<MahBoi777> genetically modified sewage
<Polydunami> Hi guys
<IngloriousPony89> I'm reminded of the Spongebob episode where the Krusty Krab is bought out by a big corporation who "improve" the resturant CupcakeWarrior
<Ingwaz> SWEEET storm siren!!!
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: it's food, and I like it everyonce and awhile.
<Gunthler> Hai YouTube
<MahBoi777> Hi YOUTUBE
<Ingwaz> i do love me a good storm
<sirwilliam> google #mcdstories for lols
<otakon> hiya YT, herostar why are we saying hello to Youtube?
<Jim> Point A, where I live, point B, nearest McDonalds http://g.co/maps/fqrkz
*Polydunami fails at doing the worm
<herostar> not fully sure
<otakon> your recordin this aren't you?
<MahBoi777> because youtube made me dinner once
<herostar> needed to test bandicam.
<mario_pony> hi
<IngloriousPony89> WHAT'S UP YOUTUBE?!
<Ingwaz> jim, you're better off that way, mcdonalds is unholy
<otakon> Arby's!
<otakon> is BETTER!
<Polydunami> Jim, I envy you
<otakon> by FAR!
<IngloriousPony89> Chick-fil-a or Subway
<Bluestrom_S> hello again bronystate
<mario_pony> subway
<DeadpoolDash> still no streams
<herostar> now to show off on flashflashrev
<mario_pony> hi Bluestrom_S
<IngloriousPony89> Hai Bluestorm_S
<Jim> ohai Bluestrom_S
<Cypresswolf> Chick-fil-A
<Polydunami> Hi there Bluestrom_S
<otakon> GOD! I love their Chicken, Bacon and Swiss sandwiches so GOOD!
<Polydunami> ^__^
<sirwilliam> otakon:freakin this!
<Tovler> Chick-Fil-A supports anti-gay marriage so I can't eat their. *goes to McDonalds*
<Cypresswolf> whats up everypony
<Tovler> *there*
<Bluestrom_S> hi Cypresswolf
<otakon> Tovler: hmm, I did not know that. You mean they are against gay marriage, correct?
<Jim> ohai Cypresswolf
<mario_pony> hi Cypresswolf
<Polydunami> You'd be surprised to hear this: Denny's has delicious food in Canada
<Cypresswolf> But they have the BEST sweet tea <3
<otakon> Denny's has good food ANYWHERE Polydunami
<CupcakeWarrior> Damnit, now im hungry
<IngloriousPony89> Where'd you find this out Tovler?
<otakon> me too
<MahBoi777> I shall return
<Polydunami> Right
<Cypresswolf> and those waffle fries ^_^
<Randomnerd> Tovler's right.
<otakon> damn it all
<Tovler> :'( And those waffle fries
<otakon> we only have sphaghetti
<Ingwaz> otakon: chick-fil-a is a restaurant owned by christians and they believe in christian values even when at work, so yes, i would imagine they oppose gay marriage
*Jim is getting hungry from all this food talk
<Randomnerd> It's owned by the Church of Latter Day Saints, to my understanding.
<flutter_spin> http://www.yogadork.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/themcrib-mcdonalds.png That is all.,
<otakon> Ingwaz: so, they wouldn't hire homosexuals correct?
<Jim> 404
<Ingwaz> Randomnerd: i dont believe that is correct
<otakon> that is fucked up
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<otakon> if true
<mario_pony> i support gay marriage but i just don't want them doing their bussines in public
<Ingwaz> otakon: actually, i dont know, i dont think they wouldnt
<Tovler> Same goes for Papa Johns too, but Corporations tend to be right wing, so what would I expect?
<IngloriousPony89> Well I'm sure the option of listing sexuality on the application would be there otakon
<otakon> yeah
<IngloriousPony89> wouldn't*
<IngloriousPony89> Sorry :P
<Polydunami> I don't really care about gay marriage meself
<otakon> it's discrimination against NOTHING that has anything to do with the job.
<Randomnerd> Ack, the Owner is SBC.
<otakon> Eh, I don't care. They aren't hurting anyone, let them get hitched
<Randomnerd> Sorry 'bout that folks.
<Tovler> It'll illegal to discriminate over race, religion, etc as of now.
<sirwilliam> brb making hot dogs...
<IngloriousPony89> If they want to be as miserable as the rest of us, go right ahead
<Randomnerd> Mormons get enough flak, I don't wanna make it harder on 'em lol
<otakon> Tovler: yh, but for how long?
<CupcakeWarrior> Gay marriage just became legal where I live, I believe
<otakon> IngloriousPony89: EXACTLY!
<Cypresswolf> I dont go to resturaunt based on their beliefs, I go because I think they're food is good.
<Polydunami> Indeed
<otakon> I've said it once, I'll say it again. As long as you don't hurt other's or yourself, do what you like with your life.
<otakon> That's my motto.
<mario_pony> um....
<RainbowJack> nobody seen TOY_PON3?
<mario_pony> nope
<otakon> um, not recently no
<CupcakeWarrior> nope
<otakon> he was on yesterday, why?
<Polydunami> Humans have an unfortunate tendency to hurt each other, though
<mario_pony> he was here yesterday why?
<Jim> I think he was on yesterday
<otakon> Polydunami: yh
<CupcakeWarrior> As long as hes not dead, its fine
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EY3SQfWhPs&t=1m45s
<Polydunami> What does that mean?
<Polydunami> yh?
<Cypresswolf> anyone ever try those taco truck meals? :) Houston has a bunch of those driving around, get several on our job sites.
<IngloriousPony89> Never even heard of that Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> Some of those, mainly the Woodlands area, has some great ones
<Tovler> otakon: In response Obama forcing christian hospitals to cover birth control, some republican proposed a bill… wait I'm thinking of something completely different.
<Polydunami> What does yh mean, otakon?
<mario_pony> yeah
<CupcakeWarrior> Cypresswolf: The ones in my town are pretty good
<otakon> Tovler: yh, but they are assholes. God forbid women have the option and choice to do what they want with their bodies....
<otakon> Polydunami: yeah
<Polydunami> Oh
<otakon> it means yeah
<otakon> I am Pro-Choice
<mario_pony> Polydunami: i just said that!

<Cypresswolf> their basically mobile fast food, some have a wide array of meals, tex mex, burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, drinks - everything short of alcohol, lots of sugary snacks :)
<Polydunami> I was only clueless on the 'yh' part
<Jim> Well, I'm going to bed.
<otakon> Cypresswolf: sounds good.
<Tovler> If birth control is banned, then viagra and vasectomies should be banned too.
<Jim> Good night everypony

<LadyCanary> xD
<Polydunami> What I meant was I didn't realize you gave me the answer
<kirzstryfe> 1,3so yeah, gonna call time out on this convo before it gets out of hand
<Ingwaz> otakon: its pretty unwise to bring up politically controversial arguments
<Ingwaz> ahh, thank you kirzstryfe
<mario_pony> Polydunami: oooo
<otakon> okay
<Tovler> Well, we're all in agreement so there's not really an argument per se.
<Cypresswolf> Depending on the area, they're hit & miss. worst I had was a job site several years back, I got this burnt mush, took me off those trucks for 7-8 months
<otakon> yuck
<mario_pony> okay so i was playing god of war 3 and.....
<Ingwaz> Tovler: i do not agree, i am simply choosing to not voice my disagreement so there will not be an argument
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe question ? can one talk about RF the song ?
<flutter_spin> http://megabronyupload.deviantart.com/gallery/34941800#/d4pbrw5 And now for Intermission

<IngloriousPony89> mario_pony: You're mom had an :O face?
<mario_pony> IngloriousPony89: wut?
<Cypresswolf> Baytown had a good one, included beef liver as a meat choice, nice culinary experience. It was great, the texture I wasn't prepared for - gritty like sand, but the flavor was wonderful
<IngloriousPony89> Shocked face
<mario_pony> IngloriousPony89: yeah
<Polydunami> I don't think that means what you think it means

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01[23:29:43]	SaxyPretender	storms? that's definately Nittany_Discord's territory <- Yep. Did I miss severe weather chat?
<mario_pony> Polydunami: what do you mean?
<CupcakeWarrior> mario_pony: Your mom watches you play video games?
<IngloriousPony89> I'm lucky that my mom is really lenient(probably spelt that wrong)with my interests. Games and ponies included :D
<flutter_spin> YES TOV! I love that vid
<BritishBrony> Man, can't spell. Good mornng everypony.
<Cypresswolf> I havent gotten anything from a taco truck since I started doing deliveries, never on the job site when they pull up
<Polydunami> you're = you are
<LadyCanary> I want a taco.
<flutter_spin> I used to play that during college
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, Nittany
<LadyCanary> And a good snuggle. >3<
<IngloriousPony89> Good morning for you BritishBrony. It's night for me :P
<mario_pony> CupcakeWarrior: no she was just in the licing room talking on the phone while iwas playing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Damn.
<Tovler> flutter_spin: you're welcome ^_^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14somebody wanted to know if the weather they were in was tornado weather
<flutter_spin> I still have it favorited somewhere :P
<mario_pony> CupcakeWarrior: *living
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: you'll be pleased to know that the storm sirens just sounded in my area and i hear thunder
<Ingwaz> i do so love a good storm
<Tovler> I thought it was Michael Jackson singing the chorus when I first heard this.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tornado sirens?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01checks SPC.
<Cypresswolf> If you happen to spot one driving around, theyre easy to spot, look like a box RV, with a menu usually on the right, has TACO in huge letters on the back
<IngloriousPony89> If it's tornado sirens you might want to consider taking cover somewhere. Just a suggestion
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: just the generic storm warning siren, it does not seem like tornado weather
<Ingwaz> IngloriousPony89: appreciate the concern but i live in an area that is known for being hit by tornados every year, right now, this just looks and sounds like a thunder storm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why would you have a siren for regular thunderstorms?
<Polydunami> Indeed
<IngloriousPony89> Quite odd
<Cypresswolf> Go for a flour tortilla, chicken or beef - cant go wrong, cilantro, cheese, some green sauce - you have the perfect taco!
<mario_pony> i have officially passed all of them except ghost of sparta and chains of olympus
<Ingwaz> you dont have a siren for when weather is getting severe?
<CupcakeWarrior> Hurray for living in the NW so no tornadoes!
*DeadpoolDash so the wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub can happen for all
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01State College doesn't have sirens period.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even though we can get tornadoes. We're just not tornado-prone.
<Ingwaz> perhaps its just that i live in a smaller town area, we have a storm siren that sounds any time the weather gets severe
<IngloriousPony89> I've never even heard of sirens for severe weather Ingwaz. Only ones for tonadoes.
<Polydunami> All we get in Vancouver is a storm warning on the Weather Network
<TopHat> tornados, or Canada.... hmmmm, I'll take tornados
<Cypresswolf> Taco Bell? Pfft :| they wouldnt know genuine mexican cuisine if it bit them the *ahem*
<IngloriousPony89> I'd take Canada personally
<BritishBrony> :3
<Ingwaz> well i can assure you, i have heard this siren many many times, and many times it is just for a good thunder storm
*DeadpoolDash THIS IS A TEST OF THE GIANT VOICE SYSTEM!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sirens in general are just to warn you that bad stuff is happening and to tune to weather stations and radio.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even then, you should keep one on.
<Polydunami> Yep
<mario_pony> nopony makes a taco like meicans and i should know
<LadyCanary> To be honest, Im freaking terrified of those things.
<BritishBrony> YES,
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: then i fail to see why you're so surprised bythis siren
<LadyCanary> Just the sound of it just makes me nervous and I start to shake. I dont know why.
<IngloriousPony89> LadyCanary: Me too. Tornadoes scare the shit outta me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because warning sirens usually go off for tornado warnings.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'd like to be near a tornado
<LadyCanary> Not the tornados.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like, see one in person
<LadyCanary> The sound of that emergency broadcast system.
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: is now SaxyTornado
<Ingwaz> perhaps your area is unique or mine is, because it regularly goes off
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I saw two tornadoes last year. One almost struck me and the people I was with.
<flutter_spin> Tornado Siren? That is when my mom gets the camera and goes outside
<Polydunami> SaxyPretender, you and me both
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And that one I think was max-rated.
<IngloriousPony89> Oh God that's horrid LadyCanary. Hate that sound SOO much
*DeadpoolDash the bees noooooo not the BEES!
<Ingwaz> and sax, tornados are exceptionally powerful, i enjoy the raw display of power, but theyre very dangerous
<mario_pony> how do you spell read like after you read a book?
<SaxyTornado> 0,14ah
<Ingwaz> -.-
<CupcakeWarrior> dat SaxyTornado
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They sure are dangerous, and fast.
<RAWRity> mario_pony: read
<Polydunami> mario_pony, it's read
<mario_pony> the past tence of read?
<mario_pony> reall wow
<RAWRity> mario_pony: eeyup, it's read
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My first tornado came from a storm that developed a low-level rotation within 10 minutes.
<Ingwaz> indeed, ive had tornados go very near my house, even had one take our trash can and throw it across the street
<Polydunami> It's always read, but past tense it's pronounced like red
<DeadpoolDash> past and present tense read is same, just pronounced differently
<mario_pony> thanks guys!
<Ingwaz> mario_pony: english is weird like that...
<RAWRity> it's all read. I read that book. He reads a book. They will read.
<Cypresswolf> I've only experience being in range of a tornado once. While I was attending Brenham in 2009, we had the whole campus close, I didnt have class that day anyway so I didnt know what was going on. :P All I know was it was windy. Stayed in my apartment all day.
<DeadpoolDash> reed and red
<IngloriousPony89> I'm guessing you live in the tornado alley area Ingwaz and Nittany

<Ingwaz> i think i live in one of the far edges of it, we regularly get hit by tornados, but usually theyre not extremely damaging, still pretty bad usually

<Polydunami> I remember when Liam Neeson was Jean Valjean

<LadyCanary> How the FUCK is that something to be defended.
<Dashie_Dashie> how I miss 4chan..

<Cypresswolf> its a twisted world
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14Because it's completely okay if that's "the way someone is"
<Ingwaz> RAGINGPretender: fgc?
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: put is a past tense
<LadyCanary> May I throw a shoe at this perfect and harass the person with a shoe?
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: well you see, when you're a mysoginistic asshole, it's easy to justify being a cock rocket.
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14fgc = fighting game community
<mario_pony> so what is the present tence of put?
<Polydunami> RAGINGPretender, I completely sympathize with you
*DeadpoolDash ...
<Ingwaz> ahh i see, someone being a douche then?
<Polydunami> And wholeheartedly
<flutter_spin> funny, yet ... kind of gross
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: I don think there is one
<RAWRity> Well, the kids who shot up his high school in Ohio the other day was"just that way". Doesn't excuse the whole killing people thing.
<Polydunami> afk
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14there's a reality show/tournament going on to promote Street Fighter x Tekken (ugh)
*DeadpoolDash the people who play most games in a competitive way are kind of dicks in general, FYI
<LadyCanary> ....
<LadyCanary> DeadpoolDash: My exboyfriend.
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14and there's two teams, one for SF and one for Tekken, each with a coach
<mario_pony> RAWRity: it's in th news right now
<MahBoi777> LOL
<LadyCanary> He got pissed at me because I didnt get the controls right.
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14and on each team, there's one female player
<LadyCanary> And I didnt know the movesets. WOW BIG DEAL.
<Phase4> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/140407 not sure if this was posted here but its cool
<kirz|art> 1,3I mash da buttonz!
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14now, the SF coach is Alex Valle, a true professional
<MahBoi777> that's stoopid. LOL
<flutter_spin> Wait a second. This is your playlist? *keeps watching*
*DeadpoolDash mashing buttons is the best moveset
<mario_pony> RAWRity: also this story of this girl who got in a fight ang got punched in the forehead then died the next day
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: thats...wow. I've heard worse reasons to get mad at a significant other, but I can't seem to think of any atm.
<Phase4> kirz|art: did that work?
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14the Tekken coach, Aris...is a complete creeper
<LadyCanary> He was an asshole.
<CupcakeWarrior> Mashing buttons is the only way to win fighting games, imho
<kirz|art> 1,3so LadyCanary, did he know the moveset or did he just mash the button? :3
<LadyCanary> Oh no he "knew"
<Ingwaz> RAGINGPretender: sexual harassment panda
<LadyCanary> Or at least I think he knew so he could be cool.
<mario_pony> RAGINGPretender: tekken i love that game!
<MahBoi777> you can't work the controls?? THAT'S IT we're through!
<LadyCanary> But still, Im no professional, I love playing for fun.
<MahBoi777> *jackie chan face*
<mario_pony> Ingwaz: lol
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14>use Team Tekken stream camera to film certain body parts of female player on his team
<LadyCanary> And I have a strong appreciation for character design and moveset.
<flutter_spin> TotalHalibut ^^
<LadyCanary> ...

<CupcakeWarrior> Oh...my
<Ingwaz> ahh...so he needs a good beating then RAGINGPretender
<LadyCanary> ...
<MahBoi777> wait wut, lol
<Phase4> work or play video games?
<mario_pony> i don't care as long as theres a good storyline
*kirz|art has a feeling he wasted an innuendo token
<LadyCanary> As a female, that kinda ticks me off.
*DeadpoolDash most guys would just be happy their girlfriend even wants to play games
*IngloriousPony89 is wondering how long is takes for this conversation to drift to Fight is Magic territory
<Ingwaz> IngloriousPony89: already thought about that
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14she took 5 days of that and quit yesterday
<LadyCanary> ...Shit.
*CupcakeWarrior is entertained by this convo
<MahBoi777> ikr?
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14and there are actually people defending Aria
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14*Aris
<flutter_spin> I instantly thought of Mane6: Fighting is Magic
<flutter_spin> but I'm distracted by Ing playlist
<RAWRity> as a human being, that REALLY ticks me off.
<LadyCanary> Seriously, oggling at a female characters breasts is one thing, but to actually make comments about it? On a LIVE show? Pathetic.
<Polydunami> Same here
<RAWRity> Seriously, you don't do that. You just fucking don't. To anybody.
<MahBoi777> it IS pathetic
<mario_pony> RAGINGPretender: it would suck if he was found beaten up in a dark alley the next day
<IngloriousPony89> Woah what show was this??
*RainbowJack wonders if TOY_PON3 will be back
*DeadpoolDash I blame reality based entertainment. Completely ruined TV programming and is ruining interweb programming
<LadyCanary> I'll admit, I'll make jokes about the female character's boobs, but never on a LIVE show. It's only as a joke.
<flutter_spin> What was that really odd video I found about that very topic
<Gunthler> ok everypony, imma fall asleep now. night.
<IngloriousPony89> Deadpooldash: Basically Jersey Shore?
<LadyCanary> Night Gunthler.
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14and there were people putting her, THE VICTIM, on blast
<IngloriousPony89> Night Gunthler
<LadyCanary> ....
<Polydunami> Okay, that part ticks me off the most
<Tovler> =_=
*DeadpoolDash even before Jersey Shore
<LadyCanary> Is LadyCanary gonna have to choke a son of a bitch?
<IngloriousPony89> Again, what show was this?
<MahBoi777> gnight Gunthler
<flutter_spin> Naw, I better not post it. Just add more fuel to the fire.
<Polydunami> I absolutely despise the part where people blame the victim
<LadyCanary> ^
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: I will help you. With gusto.
<MahBoi777> LOL
<LadyCanary> The poor girl.
*DeadpoolDash basically the second MTV stopped playing music videos was the beginning of the end
<RAWRity> And this is why we can't have nice things.
<IngloriousPony89> Among other reasons
<LadyCanary> Reality killed the music video star.
<flutter_spin> http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/418412 hehe, the video was saved in my Newgrounds Folder
<mario_pony> well goodnight everypony it was fun chatting with you all.:)
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14later mario_pony
<IngloriousPony89> One last time, and not to incur even more rage, what show was this that y'all are talking about??
<LadyCanary> Nice mario_pony!
<CupcakeWarrior> Gnight mario_pony
<Tovler> nite, mario_pony
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14IngloriousPony89, the show is called Cross Assault
<IngloriousPony89> Night mario-pony!
<flutter_spin> My brother works for Newgrounds, so he sometimes posts stuff to me
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14it's a series of streams
<RAWRity> no, the general acceptance of douchebaggery and immaturity amonst geek culture is pretty much the main reason we can't have ncie things. Like how we can't have a God of War game without Kratos fucking the Goddes of Love into unconciousness while 2 lesbians get off to it.
<Polydunami> Buenas noches mario_pony ^__^
<Polydunami> He's gone
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14oh yeah, the worst part?
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14this guy was like

*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<CupcakeWarrior> You know, its fun to watch Saxy raeg
<LadyCanary> >implying every Fighting game has to do with sexual harassment.
<Polydunami> I call shenanigans on this fogy
<IngloriousPony89> And of course it's IGN too
<flutter_spin> *sigh* Why does this remind me of the brony who got a hug at bronycon?
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14was like "Wait, I can't have Street Fighter without sexual harrasment?"
<LadyCanary> FUCK.
<RAWRity> RAGINGPretender: as long as his ilk are allowed to get away with it, that's sadly true.
<LadyCanary> Pardon my language.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: there's not a fucking thing to pardon.
<Midnight_Tempest> angry LC is angry
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14I LOVE fighting games as you guys know
<Ingwaz> LadyCanary: what have we told you about speaking fancy?
<flutter_spin> pleaseeeeee use mlp swearing
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14but, the community needs SERIOUS work
<otakon> LadyCanary: keep doing it!
<Ingwaz> lies RAGINGPretender, you wouldnt play BB with me
<MahBoi777> BUCK?
<RAWRity> Fuck that guy. In the ass. With a cactus. Until his farts ECHO.
<LadyCanary> ^
<Midnight_Tempest> lolz
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14I'm sorry Ingwaz ;___;
<MahBoi777> OW DAYUM
<Ingwaz> uhhh RAWRity why would that cause his farts to echo?
<CupcakeWarrior> Whoa RAWRity calm down!
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: turn his sphicnter into a CAVE.
<IngloriousPony89> Even if it doesn't that means the torture wouldn't stop.
<MahBoi777> @_o
<IngloriousPony89> Make an example outta him
<Ingwaz> you seem to have an unhealthy amount of knowledge on this subject RAWRity, is there something you would like to tell us?
<flutter_spin> I have no idea why I instantly thought of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1JG4cycd4w
<Tovler> Derpy is against the spirit for friendship but twisting a bear's neck isn't?
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14unfortunately, the fighting game community has a notion of being a "boy's club"
<Cypresswolf> *smacks everypony on the forehead* You could have had a V8! :P Like Me :)
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: let's just say I'm not allowed back in New York anymore, and leave it at that.
<MahBoi777> flutter_spin: Thank you so much:D
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14so the few female players that do play get shit flung their way to no end
<LadyCanary> :/
<LadyCanary> How unfortunate...
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14yep
<Polydunami> flutter_spin, I'm sorry to do this, but I was just reminded of this clip
<Polydunami> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0BUysglCZA
<Tovler> fat girls get it the worst.
<Polydunami> Welcome to the weird part of Youtube
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14also, RAWRity can't come see us NY people ;___;
<CupcakeWarrior> dafuq Polydunami ?
<LadyCanary> o3o
<Polydunami> Exactly
<flutter_spin> uggggh. That clip. Never did like it.
<MahBoi777> Polydunami: IF PAC-MAN WAS A HUMAN
<CupcakeWarrior> Also Polydunami, dat music
<Polydunami> Yeah
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14and here's the kicker, Kotaku posted an article about this whole incident
<RAWRity> That's a lot of how it is amongst the FPS community. It's pretty much impossible for a female player to come into a game without getting hassled out the wazoo. Even if it's not anything derogatory, it's always "OMG, a girl! with like, lady parts!"
<Polydunami> Those are actually bees
<IngloriousPony89> Reminds me of a Youtube video RAWRity. Ill try to find it
<MahBoi777> not the bees!
<Polydunami> Wait, what's so special about a girl with lady parts?
<RAWRity> RAGINGPretender: Fuck Kotaku. Fuck Gawker. Fuck Gizmodo. Fuck all of them and their nerdbaiting horse shit.
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14the president before me posted it in my school's fighiting game club FB page
<Ingwaz> RAWRity: what are these..."gurls" you speak of?
<OneTrickPony> :3
<flutter_spin> *had to refresh

<CupcakeWarrior> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfmPREbTd8&feature=youtu.be
<flutter_spin> whoa now. I know gawker sites have gone way downhill, but its my source of gaming news
<LadyCanary> What pisses ME off mostly, is that some girls feed into the whole sexism, as in how they just take sexy pics of themselves with a controller and say OMG YEAAHHH I PLAY WOW LOLOL. Want a freaking medal? UGH. You dont have to be an attention whore...girls get enough shit in places of the gaming community.
<Ingwaz> hey RAGINGPretender, http://i41.tinypic.com/21niq8z.jpg
*kirz|art cheers LadyCanary
<MahBoi777> WOO
<IngloriousPony89> I think most of those girls aren't really gamers themselves LadyCanary.
<flutter_spin> I play on the trying to be sexy = not sexy
<OneTrickPony> do none of the mods want to stream right now?
<kirz|art> 1,3owait, girls can't play games and aren't on the internet, forgot that for a second :3 >.>
<Polydunami> CupcakeWarrior, that is awesome
<IngloriousPony89> They play a few rounds of MW3 and think there gamers
<Polydunami> I love freaky stuff myself
<RAWRity> As I recall it, a few months ago, a reporter for one of Gawker's sites posted a long ass speal about how this guy she went on a date with was a total loser because he as a former M:TG player. The site got a record number of hits for the month.
<LadyCanary> No. They arent. I dont make a big deal that I play vidya games, I just have a normal conversation with guys OR girls about said game.
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14oh yeah, THAT debacle, RAWRity =_=

<CupcakeWarrior> Ohai Shizuka

<flutter_spin> http://kotaku.com/5888979/witness-the-gloriously-annoying-marriage-of-ocarina-of-time-and-my-little-pony I still can't believe they posted that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I only want to play online games with friends now.
<RAWRity> That's whot those sites do. They post shit to piss people off and gain more views, and thus more ad revenue.
<IngloriousPony89> Trolling is entertaining I guess
<MahBoi777> >.>
<Ingwaz> RAGINGPretender: dont forget to put on your serious face http://i40.tinypic.com/2ia7ats.jpg
<kirz|art> 1,3sorry, had to play that card for the fun of it <3
<Polydunami> Trolling is kind of fun, tbh
<RAWRity> Gamer Girls may have been pretty uncommon 20 years ago, but nowadays, there's TONS of femals gamers. And people need to stop acting like they aren't there, or that they should be objectified.
*RAGINGPretender puts in his Groucho Marx glasses and his Gummi hat

<otakon> night kirz|art sleep well
<IngloriousPony89> RAWRity: That reminds me of something I heard. I dont remember when, but the head of advertising for a game OK'd to have a female character be on the ads wearing not so appropriate armor because it was the only real thing they could advertist due to the game being to lackluster.
<Gluepop> NIGJT
<Gluepop> NIGHT
<Polydunami> Goodnight Derpy and kkirz ^__^
<otakon> night Derpy_Hooves sleep well
<IngloriousPony89> Night Derpy!
<kirz|art> 1,3I'm not leaving, other ponies are :p
<CupcakeWarrior> By any chance RAGINGPretender, do you play Blazblue?
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14yep
<RAWRity> It's the same thing with Comic companies. They keep targeting 15-year-old boys, yet fail to realize that THAT EXACT DEMOGRAPHIC IS THE MOST HATED AMONGST EVERYONE ELSE. And when you try to play a game or read a comic book, and have so many cheesecake and ass shots thrown in your face, it gets to the point where you feel insulted.
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14^
*LadyCanary hugs RAWRity. All the yes.
<otakon> IngloriousPony89: probably something like Evil Zone from the PS1 days. I actually like that one.

<Polydunami> Hey kirz, I thought you said you were going to bed
<kirz|art> 1,3one reason the Tomb Raider reboot looks interesting, actually giving character to the character
<LadyCanary> ^
<Polydunami> But then I realised other ponies were
<Gluepop> AWESOME LINK INGWAZ
<otakon> RAWRity: good point. I don't mind that stuff, but for God's sake don't overdo it.
<IngloriousPony89> I gotta get to bed despite this interesting conversation. Goodnight y'all!
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgYnWtCC-Xk WHy Fluttershy? Why must you sing one of my favorite songs of all time?
<Tovler> 15 y/o boys don't even have money.
<otakon> nigth IngloriousPony89 see you on the battlefield!
<fillyfillyy> RAWRity: umm im a 15 year old boy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh hi~ whats going on ?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> night IngloriousPony89 ~
<Ingwaz> flutter_spin: dr. mario has awesome music
<Gluepop> lol
<fillyfillyy> are you saying they shouldnt target me
<Polydunami> You just missed a raging Saxy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> really ?
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14yep
<CupcakeWarrior> eeyup
<kirz|art> 1,3we're raging on the subject of women stereotyped in video games and on the internet, care to weigh in? :)
<MahBoi777> so much rage
<Ingwaz> always play as dr. mario on super smash bros melee
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> :O
<IngloriousPony89> And I think Bayonetta actually handled making a sexy character not be sexist pretty well. Not perfect, but the developers did a pretty good job
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14agreed
<Ingwaz> IngloriousPony89: they opennly admitted it was to make it sexy
<RAWRity> fillyfillyy: that's exactly what I'm saying. The average 15 yo boy is imature, and just interested in explosions and tits. This doesn't make for an enjoyable game or story for anybody else.
<Ingwaz> they just gave it good gameplay as well
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14Bayonetta's character seemed to be pretty independant
<Gluepop> RAINBOW DASH IN MATRIX http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tReXtRiW7dI
<kirz|art> 1,3but I like explosions :(
<MahBoi777> I LIKE EXPLOSIONS
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14also, to those wondering if I play Blazblue or not: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UGh-3eAtY8
<otakon> IngloriousPony89: agreed, if only for all that damn hair though.
*Shizuka 13doesn't look at explosions
<Gluepop> :P
<Shizuka> 13like a cool pony
<RAWRity> If video games and comic books want to stay relevant, they have to realise that they aren't going to be able to profit soully off of teenage boys. They have to GROW UP.
<RAGINGPretender> 0,14I'm the Bang player XD
<kirz|art> 1,3that's because Shizuka is a badass pony
<fillyfillyy> RAWRity: are you saying i only like explosions and tits? cause i dont im not really the average 15 year old boy
<IngloriousPony89> And now I'm off to bed. Ciao!
<Gluepop> KABOOM
<Cypresswolf> *thinks about joining in conversation...* nope. I come here to escape all that stuff.
<MahBoi777> chow!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> taokaka is best fighter i'm not taking a no for answer
<otakon> Shizuka: eeyup that makes you cool. until you get blown back by the shockwave and end up in the hosptial for contusions, a concussion and broken limbs....
<otakon> damn it
<fillyfillyy> RAWRity: im not immature bro
<otakon> My chat derped, brb
<Shizuka> 13pff, buddha mode
<RAWRity> fillyfillyy: I'm not saying you are. I'm saying that that's the kind of mindset they market towards, and that just isn't the audience for games anymore.
<RainbowJack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qzbuQWYTnc just love this beat
<LadyCanary> Yaaay Saxy~
<kirz|art> 1,3can I rub your belly for good luck? :3

*LadyCanary nuzzles Shizuka
<CupcakeWarrior> RainbowJack: dat plot
<otakon> damn it what I miss?
<Gluepop> cool song
*Jaketehsnake has returned!
<Tovler> It's fun to apart of a demographic that is never marketed towards.
<RainbowJack> CupcakeWarrior: yeah
<otakon> Shizu is getting hugs, what awesome thing did she say?
<RAWRity> Because seriously, it gets downright embarassing when you're reading a comic, and suddenly get a fullpage spread of Wonder Woman's ASS, in lovingly detailed lingerie.
<kirz|art> 1,3she was being Shizu
<otakon> oh
<Shizuka> 13bread zeppelin
<MahBoi777> welcome back Jaketehsnake
<Cypresswolf> Im going to sleep. Midnight is close, and deliveries start early tomorrow. Goodnight :)
<Gluepop> AND LYRICS

<otakon> kirz|art: Powergirl, 'nuff said.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SaxyPretender never learned how to play with the Scruffy Old Man ~
<SaxyPretender> 0,14actually, Power Girl's character is usually well developed
<otakon> SaxyPretender: so is her chest.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc
<Polydunami> Rarity! <3
<LadyCanary> I reaaaally dislike Power Girl.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/x1TH6.jpg by wonderful dcd~<3
<otakon> Which is exposed all the damn time
<RAWRity> kirz|art: and the ones that aren't are quickly being dragged back (See: New 52 relaunch)
<LadyCanary> OMG.
<Gluepop> NICE
<LadyCanary> Shizuka that is FABULOUS
<kirz|art> 1,3I believe Power Girl is one of the New52 getting the axe
<flutter_spin> Powerpuff Girls? what? oh.. sry, my mind went elsewhere
<otakon> Shizuka: that is awesome, I should really congratualate NewDCD on that later on.
<Gluepop> aww gtg :( night
<Polydunami> I love Rarity for some reason
<otakon> flutter_spin: no, Powergirl
<otakon> night Gluepop sorry to see you go
<Ingwaz> SaxyPretender: you seemed like you were dropping yoru combos in that video, nervous?
<Tovler> The girl with the white shirt?
<otakon> screw it
*otakon hugs Shizuka
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, I generally can't hold my combos, but yeah, i was nervous too
<LadyCanary> Read Animal Man's New52. It's pretty darn good.

<emangamer> night otakon
<otakon> night fillyfillyy come back soon, sleep well!
<RAWRity> Power Girl can actually be interesting when she's got a decen writer behind her, but yeah, her costume is completely shameless fanservice. WHY DOES SHE NEED A CLEAVAGE WINDOW?
<kirz|art> 1,3I'm a Lantern fan myself, though I've been getting Dark Knight as well
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and thanks LadyCanary, I'm hoping i can do well in at least SCV
<LadyCanary> ^-^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night emangamer Sleep Well ~
<fillyfillyy> OMG PING from MOD!!!! SaxyPretender you made my day/night
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<fillyfillyy> lol night nows
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sleep well ~ fillyfillyy ~
<CupcakeWarrior> This chat needs more ponies
<otakon> RAWRity: she doesn't. i'm not saying it's not nice to look at but even to me it seems a bit shameless. First time I saw the character design I thought "Must be fanwork..must be..."
<kirz|art> 1,3that reminds me, I need to stop by the comic store tomorrow :)
<Polydunami> I'm usually skeptical about fanservice in my entertainment
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I haven't read comics in aaaages
<otakon> I don't mind fanservice
<SaxyPretender> 0,14too broke to buy ;___;
<Tovler> I don't know. I've only heard that cleavege gets sweaty and it's nice to have some air [/talking_out_of_ass]
<otakon> But too much breaks it
<Polydunami> Indeed
<RAWRity> otakon: apparently she's getting a new costume. I believe with less blatant fanservice.
<CupcakeWarrior> fanservice is best service
<LadyCanary> I could lend you one of mine, Saxy.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i demand more derpy ducreux pics about pony songs ~
<LadyCanary> Animal Man New52.
<otakon> RAWRity: inb4 lots of inbetween the legs shots
<flutter_spin> http://warpout.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Barier-287555713 Is still an awesome pic. I'm sorry. Were you guys saying something?
<Polydunami> Indeed
<kirz|art> 1,3fanservice with no substance, fastest way to turn me off of a series/game/comic/person/etc
<LadyCanary> ^
<RAWRity> Fanservice CAN be done well. I think that One Piece generally pulls it off well, though it can be distracting. And GTO did a fantastic job of making the fanservice comical and part of the plot.
<Polydunami> Same here, kirz
<Tovler> Fanservice reminds me that I'm an animal with basic instincts.
<otakon> RAWRity: agreed, but damn it all if Edo doesn't like his Big Girls it seems....
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: I LOVE GTO.
<Polydunami> One Piece is so wacky
<RAWRity> But generally in comic books, you get tons of upskirt and bondage shots for females.
<Polydunami> I love it
<otakon> I love One Piece
<LadyCanary> Indeed he is a Great Teacher <3
<kirz|art> 1,3glitter's nice to look at, but doesn't do much for you at the end of the day
<LadyCanary> This is why the anime club at my high school was crap.
<otakon> fave character
<RAWRity> Onizuka is Best Teacher
<Polydunami> For me, One Piece wins over Bleach and Naruto
<otakon> FRANKY!
<RainbowJack> Ladycanary : great Teahcer Onizuka
<otakon> ^^^
<Polydunami> Oh, And GTO
<LadyCanary> Yes <3
<CupcakeWarrior> I really need to watch more anime
<applejack096> LOL
<flutter_spin> I don't know. I never really bothered with any of those anime series
<otakon> Polydunami: you know why? NO FRIGGIN FILLER! EVERYTHING IS IMPORTANT!
<Tovler> yay. new chapter of Bleach tomorrow
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh right
<flutter_spin> And how many episodes of Bleach are there /sigh
<otakon> flutter_spin: the manga, go for the manga!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Kubooooooooo
<Polydunami> otakon: there was filler in One Piece
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/Yj2XM.png
<flutter_spin> I don't like reading.
<RAWRity> Anime Club at my high school had a really bad knack for showing fanservicey shows. Especially Green Green and Maburaho
*kirz|art noms on Dashie_Dashie
<LadyCanary> Who played GTO in the english version?
<LadyCanary> I cant remember...
<Tovler> Soul Eater? Oh dammit. Its a new chapter of Soul Eater Not.
<CupcakeWarrior> Is it wierd that I only watch english dubs?
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: Steve Blum?
<otakon> Polydunami: not really, everything has importance. Every character introduced has development. I mean hell, look at Colby(spelling) from Ep.1 showing up just before the great war and all
<Polydunami> I mean the anime
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: no, there's plenty of peopl who just prefer dubs.
<otakon> Probably Steve Blum
<otakon> Polydunami: yh, maybe a little
<Polydunami> The One Piece anime had filler, but it was entertaining
<Polydunami> G8, for one
<otakon> G8?
<Polydunami> It's after Skypiea
<otakon> ah
<RAWRity> I never watched much of the One piece anime, because I was introduced via the 4Kids dub. Oh lord.
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: Ah yes!
<applejack096> Hi guys! 4th day on bronystate today! Im in England and its 5 in the morn i cant get to sleep cause im ill so i went on brony state im missing skool YAAY!:D
<RAWRity> that fucking 4Kids dub.
<LadyCanary> You're right
<otakon> RAWRity: DO NOT MENTION THAT BLASPHEMY!
<flutter_spin> My mom used to buy me Sonic comic books. I still have like 30 of them in the garage. I just never really liked reading in general.
<applejack096> lol
<Tovler> One Piece was so awesome that the 4kids dub made me want to see more.
<Polydunami> Hey applejack, which year?
<otakon> applejack096: well welcome! you walked into animation discussion!
<applejack096> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> For some reason, I used to love the dub of Sonic X
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: If I remember correctly, they had Steve Blum and Wendy Lee do like, half the voices on the GTO dub.
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, it's applejack096!
<otakon> RAWRity: the intro alone is shameful enough.
<AttackWithHugs> Hello, applejack096
<Tovler> Those super-old sonic comics might be worth something
<otakon> indeed
<LadyCanary> I think so RAWRity: I must watch it agaaaaain. Because HE BREAKS DOWN THE FUCKING WALLS
<applejack096> Polydunami im 12 and in yr 7

*CupcakeWarrior revives otakon
*TopHat is also dead......
<otakon> Photon-Phoenix: what bear thing?
<RAWRity> Yo-ho-ho, He took a bite of gum-gum!
<otakon> ARGH!
<RAWRity> otakon: just take a bite of gum-gum and you'll be fine!
*otakon tackles RAWRity "SHADDUP!!!!"
<Dashie_Dashie> DO HO HO
<LadyCanary> Dum dum has gum gum?
<RAWRity> Photon-Phoenix: he means Chopper.
<otakon> Chopper is a deer
<otakon> NOT a bear
<Dark__Horst> thiws hurts me, and i don't even care about one piece
<Tovler|Sleep> I thought he was a Tanuki
<Photon-Phoenix> he turns into something that resembles a bear
<Photon-Phoenix> when mad
<otakon> Actually, we haven't even SEEN a Bear Zoan type
<LadyCanary> Or a manbearpig.
<Dark__Horst> naw, that's a deer
<RAWRity> I especially love how they couldn't figure out anything for Nami's part. "An L-A-D-Y Nami's not shy"
<otakon> Photon-Phoenix: it's an empowered human form.
<RAWRity> otakon: Oda's obviously saving it.
<Polydunami> If Oda can come up with a candlewax power...
<otakon> RAWRity: yeah, likely. There is that one bear martial artist but he's not a Zoan.
<RAWRity> otakon: there's also Kuma

<otakon> RAWRity: he's got a bear motif, but he's Devil Fruit is Paw-Paw, a Paramecia type.
<Photon-Phoenix> Pirate Rap vs. Dragon Ball GT Step into the Gran Tour
<RAWRity> otakon: I know, but he still counts as a Bear. As fluttershy would say "He's a Bear"
<otakon> Photon-Phoenix: neither
<otakon> RAWRity: eh, he's a cyborg.
<RAWRity> Photon-Phoenix: I'll take "Rock The Dragon" any day.
<Tovler|Sleep> How can a paw print power be any threat?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i see a lot of one piece talk ~ but it needs moar ponies http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7dRL_hLlLI

<RAWRity> Even though DBZ was full of boring filler, that damn opening got you PUMPED.
<otakon> RAWRity: eeyup
<LadyCanary> DRAGON DRAGON RIDE THE DRAGON
<Photon-Phoenix> Dragon ball GT's opening made my brain shut off
<LadyCanary> Oh rock.
<Tovler|Sleep> Shouldn't paw pads just absorb stuff?
<LadyCanary> My bad~
<RAWRity> Especially the stock screams in their. And that guitar riff!
<Photon-Phoenix> so all I remember is the parapara brothers and that retarded robot
<RAWRity> Photon-Phoenix: People actualy watched GT?
<Polydunami> See, we Canadians got a different opening song
<Photon-Phoenix> noe
<Photon-Phoenix> nope
<CupcakeWarrior> I watched GT and I hated it
<Photon-Phoenix> I saw 5 eps max
<otakon> Tovler|Sleep: enope, not in this case. It reflects anything with the same amount of force that is applied. You want a clip?
<Tovler|Sleep> Nope, still no new Bleach chapter
<LadyCanary> Bleach might be ending
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it is
<RAWRity> really, in terms of where the series should have ended...I think that once Goku beat Piccolo Jr. it should have wrapped up.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this arc is the last one
<Polydunami> Kubo Tite wants to make his final arc epic
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: It's just started its last arc this month.
<CupcakeWarrior> I did like the GT opening theme though
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> this one is for otakon and RAWRity http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoDdRR16pOk
<Tovler|Sleep> ending in 3.5 years
<LadyCanary> Well whaddaya know.

<Phase4> Guys, protip: on youtube theres a button labled share, click it and it will give you a short link that doesnt include the playlist
<Photon-Phoenix> or
<Photon-Phoenix> only copy until it says &
<Tovler|Sleep> I need to go read Gintama. I only watch the anime.
<Phase4> that allso works but the share one is shorter
<Polydunami> Gintama is hilarious
<Phase4> and theres less chance of copying to little
<Photon-Phoenix> youtu.be/rV_0n5gp1fE
<Photon-Phoenix> ?
<Photon-Phoenix> that one?
<RAWRity> you know what Manga everybody should read? Berserk.

<otakon> RAWRity: too depressing for my tastes tbh.
<Photon-Phoenix> then just type out youtu.be and copy the V= tag
<Polydunami> Hey RAWRity, that manga won't sit well with some ponies
<CupcakeWarrior> I only WATCH the anime not read them
<applejack096> i read and watch
<RAWRity> Berserk has, hands down, the best art I've ever seen in a manga.
<AttackWithHugs> Tovler|Sleep: Whaaaa?
<RainbowJack> i just love this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MVgreWeEek
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seqVdo__xgM&feature=related ... oh my word? What I click?
<CupcakeWarrior> I hate manga for some reason
<Tovler|Sleep> My Little Dashie is reminding me of those poignant and sad anecdotes from Gintama.
*Midnight_Tempest cowers in a corner from what he saw and heard
<RAWRity> I prefer to read the manga. Sometimes I'll watch the anime, but with long running titles, I dent to opt for the source material.
<LadyCanary> Well, Im off to bed everyone. Have a great day/night all! I love you all
<otakon> night LadyCanary sleep well dear and see you soon I hope!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night LadyCanary ~ Sleep Well ~
<CupcakeWarrior> Good night LC
<Polydunami> Goodnight LadyCanary ^__^
*otakon hugs LadyCanary goodnight
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later LadyCanary
<RAWRity> wait... Vampire Knight is still going on? Dafux?
<Polydunami> I'm currently trying to get through Skip Beat
*LadyCanary hugs everypony. Goodnight!
<Tovler|Sleep> The only reason I'm in to Bleach is because the manga chapters take 2 minutes out of my life a week.
<Polydunami> And yeah, we still have Vampire Knight
<RAWRity> I've heard good things about Skip Beat
<Polydunami> Me too
<CupcakeWarrior> Bleach is waaaay too long
<Midnight_Tempest> Bleach is the new DBZ
<Phase4> does anyone know how long it takes that confirm thing to come through from paypal?
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: and yet it doesn't take long to archive binge at all.
<CupcakeWarrior> Bleach is actually longer than dbz i believe
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: no, you see DBZ at least had decent fights. Bleach doesn't even have that anymore.
<Midnight_Tempest> its gotta be double the episodes at least
<Tovler|Sleep> The way Bleach is drawn, I'm able to tear through each chapter like a flipbook
<Polydunami> One Piece is probably going to be twice as long as Dragonball
<Polydunami> Probably being the keyword here
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: not quite. Dragonball's manga ended at 520 chapters. Bleach is at about 480 atm.
<Tovler|Sleep> One Piece take like 10 minutes to read each chapter.
<Shizuka> 13http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/qah4g/something_is_happening_on_the_official_baldurs/
<Shizuka> 13TINFOIL HATS GO
<Polydunami> It's called substance
*DeadpoolDash and now anime is being discussed
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: I am talking about the anime
<Midnight_Tempest> DBZ was maybe around 300 eps... Bleach has gotta be almost 400 maybe 500... havent watched in over a year, maybe 2
<Photon-Phoenix> One Piece will go as long as it needs to because One Piece ends when he gets to the grand line
<otakon> Shizuka: you always break out the tinfoil hats...
<Midnight_Tempest> aliens
<Photon-Phoenix> well, wants to
<Shizuka> 13but i have reason this time
<CupcakeWarrior> The worst anime I have ever seen is Girls Bravo
<Shizuka> 13ACTIVITY ON THE BALDURS GATE WEBSITE
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: with the shitload of filler DBZ had, put with Dragonball and GT, it's still longer.
<otakon> QWAT!?
<otakon> WHAT?!
<otakon> :P
<Tovler|Sleep> Aw. I loved Girls Bravo
<Midnight_Tempest> what? Baldurs Gate, seriously?
*otakon puts on a tinfoil hat
<CupcakeWarrior> It had way to much fanservice and cliches
<otakon> Okay, that is reason enough for it
<RAWRity> Photon-Phoenix: he's already in the grand line. It'll end when he reaches the end of it, and becomes the Pirate King.
<Phase4> Shizuka: http://baldursgate.com/ so the music wasnt allways there?
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: Eiken, it was hentai but it wasn't.
<Shizuka> 13no apparently this is very very recent
<otakon> link please?
*DeadpoolDash Justice League Doom was pretty good
<otakon> I missed it
<Shizuka> 13like within hours recent
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: True dat
<flutter_spin> midnight? ugh. I turned into a pumpkin!
<Phase4> oh woah
<RAWRity> If you think Girls Bravo is bad...WATCH IKKI TOUSEN. Jesus christ that anime...AND IT'S STILL GOING ON. FOR TEN SEASONS.
<Phase4> Shizuka: look at the source
<RAWRity> *Five seasons
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity: GT should never have been made... it wasnt even canon to the series
<SaxyPretender> 0,14really?
<RAWRity> sorry.
<Polydunami> Oh dang it, chat is breaking again
<Polydunami> Hold on
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Oh god that show is terrible
*DeadpoolDash ikki tousen is great
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...yfw I actually wanna see Ikki Tousen >.>
<Polydunami> Okay
<SaxyPretender> 0,14;____;
*DeadpoolDash and queen's blade
<Phase4> INCOMING TEXT WALL FROM THE SOURCE OF BAULDERS GATE WEBSITE
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: well, seeing as Toriyama contributed to that series, its cononicity is debateable.
<otakon> RAWRity: Ikki Tousen? I couldn't get past eh english dub
<Phase4> <!-- February 28, 2012 --><!-- Shadowy Figure- Raise Dead : Infinity Engine --><!-- For years, I clung to the memory of it. Then the memory of the memory. --><!-- And then... it returned. Better than it was before. --><!-- Pore over the tapestries and works of art hanging from our walls if you wish, Child of Bhaal... perhaps you will find a clue. But patience, ah... patience would reveal it all. -->
*Shizuka 13is reading the page quote in the sing songy voice of the prophets
*Midnight_Tempest doesnt watch anime anymore cause its all the same and BORING... for the most part...
<Tovler|Sleep> I like the Bakemonogatari, Zetsubo Sensei, Maria Holic type shows.
<RainbowJack> would NewDCD like this one ? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_995585&v=TxtRj40K3p0&src_vid=Fj3auvTX8xE
<CupcakeWarrior> I liked Queens Blade only for the character that shot acid out of her tits
<Shizuka> 13my body can't even handle it right now
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: In the first 3 episodes alone. There are, no joke, nearly 200 SEPARATE PANTIE SHOTS.
<otakon> DeadpoolDash: yh, but at least Queesn's Blade actualy has character development. And huge bazooms.
<Tovler|Sleep> I don't know what genre to call dialog driven anime.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I know
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> boulders gate really ?
<Phase4> <!-- As the silver moon waxes and wanes, so too does life. -->
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I once a trailer for it in my younger, immature days
*DeadpoolDash but seriously Black Lagoon is so awesome
<CupcakeWarrior> FUCK Ikki Toussen
<Polydunami> Anime is only a medium for many genres of entertainment to be portrayed
<otakon> Cattleya is my fav, I love a girl who can swing a huge sword:)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dem innuendos
<Midnight_Tempest> SaxyPretender: arent you still immature?
<Tovler|Sleep> :( Towa no Quon has ended.
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: there are shots of the girls from behind where you CAN STILL SEE CAMEL TOE.
<RainbowJack> Dance in the vampire bund was a cool one
*DeadpoolDash she swings lots of big things
<otakon> RAWRity: not surprising
<RAWRity> Do not fucking watch Ikki Tousen. It sucks ass.
<RAWRity> it's PAINFUL
<otakon> I know
<Midnight_Tempest> that why i liked Queen's Blade... unnessecary pantshots .///.
<Tovler|Sleep> Sekirei is better than Ikki Tousen
<otakon> I couldn't even get through the FIRST EPISODE
*RainbowJack loves Zero No tsukiama
<otakon> and Iw as like "hmm, this could be good"
<otakon> but I was HORRIBLY wrong
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, I'm still relatively immature, but not to the extent I was ages ago
<RAWRity> like, not even so bad you can laught at it. So bad you feel you need to take a shower to cleanse yourself.
<RainbowJack> have to go guys
<Tovler|Sleep> Ikki Tousen was so boring to me. I don't know why
<CupcakeWarrior> Ikki Tousen was so bad I almost puked
*DeadpoolDash manyuu hikenchou is neat
<RainbowJack> bye bye
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: unless you're never seen a girl in real life, you'll hate it.
<otakon> RAWRity: I'd rather watch Tencho Tenge
<CupcakeWarrior> And it was only the first episode
<Polydunami> I'm genuinely skeptical when it comes to gratuitous fanservice in my animes :)
<Tovler|Sleep> Manyuu Hikenhou bored me too.
<otakon> DeadpoolDash: isn't that the one where breast expansion is used as fighting style or something?
<Polydunami> WHAT!?
<otakon> yeah
<CupcakeWarrior> To love ru has tons of fanservice
*Midnight_Tempest actually has a model of Menace from Queen's Blade .___.
*DeadpoolDash ....maybe....
<otakon> it's WEIRD
<Tovler|Sleep> Seikon no Qwaser rocks my socks!
<Polydunami> Hang on, afk
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...we're venturing into strange territory
<otakon> yeah
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I suggest we turn back
<otakon> agreed
<kirz|art> 1,3SH-BAM. *insert PG-13 sign*
<otakon> Even I shall not plumb those depths
<CupcakeWarrior> PONY TIEM
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
*otakon puts out Midnight_Tempest
<CupcakeWarrior> Please
<Midnight_Tempest> i will go to those dirty dirty depths... but on my own time...
<Tovler|Sleep> Michiko to Hatchin, is basically Samurai Champloo but with girls.
<RAWRity> But if you want a "quick" viewing expericence of genuinely disturbing fanservice, look no further than Eiken. It has 2 characters riding, no joke, a banana bost...down a slide of chocholate sauce.
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: why don't you change your nick to constanly burnign?
*CupcakeWarrior goes to watch Eiken
<RAWRity> also, there's a 10 year old girl who has THE LARGEST BREASTS IN THE ENTIRE SHOW.
<kirz|art> 1,3ok, seriously, time to change the topic
<otakon> RAWRity: twelve year old, 112cm, NOT her height
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: don't fucking do it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...ooookay
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: cause im not always burning... sometimes im inert
<Tovler|Sleep> Eiken is just 2 ovas
<RAWRity> otakon: I know.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14t-t-topic change
<otakon> okay!
<RAWRity> Tovler|Sleep: and yet it's still awful.
<otakon> how about
<otakon> MUFFINS!
<Midnight_Tempest> c-c-c-c-combo breaker
<otakon> you fav, NOW!
<Shizuka> 13ACTIVITY ON THE BALDURS GATE SITE
<Shizuka> 13CONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE GO
<otakon> Chocolate Chip!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<otakon> Shizuka: remake?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ALIENS DID IT
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> new game
<Midnight_Tempest> new baldurs gate game... or remake?
<otakon> God I hope a remake
<kirz|art> 1,3inb4 GODAMMITDARIBOT
<RAWRity> Shizuka: if it's anything like what happen with the Refused site a few years back. It won't be till 2015 that you actually get any news.
<otakon> GODDAMNITDARIBOT!!!!
<Tovler|Sleep> What's a Bolder Gate. I can't participate!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> can i hope for remake and new game ?
<Midnight_Tempest> i couldnt get into that game... too slow and i hated the THACO armor system
<Shizuka> 13AD&D rules were pretty dumb
<otakon> Tovler|Sleep: old school D and D rpg from when Black Isle was GREAT
<RAWRity> another manga with way too much fanservice (or rather, Manwha): Ragnarok
<Shizuka> 13getting a 3.5e baldurs gate would be great
<otakon> Shizuka: negative AC is good, makes 0 sense
<Midnight_Tempest> D&D 3.5 is apparently best, but i never played that version
<Shizuka> 134e... i guess that would be okay if they got all the team together
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: basic d20 ruleset, very uniform
<RAWRity> IIRC, first level magic users in AD&D had a total of 1 spell.
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont mind 4th, cause im a noob to D&D... but i enjoy it so much
<Shizuka> 13yeah... to hit armor class 0... WAT
<otakon> RAWRity: eeyup, and a CAT could kill them
<Polydunami> Okay, there are lots of manga without gratuitous fanservice so let's shift the conversation that way
<RoboGerbil> Ad&D armor and THAC0 vs the d20 system are really very similar
<Ingwaz> well...that was fairly pointless
<Polydunami> Or other ways too
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> bronysate need an oficial team for tf2, left 4 dead and some other games ~ so everyone can go mod vs viewers or something like it ~
*DeadpoolDash GANTZ was different
<RAWRity> So if you wanted to be a high level magic user, you had a learning curb as steep as the fucking grand canyon.
<otakon> Shizuka: it's easy, add a -AC to hit it, and subtract a +AC to hit.
<Ingwaz> just trekked in a slight drizzle for about 20 minutes to find the source of a noise that sounded like a car horn, thought maybe somebody wrecked. Get to the area where the noise is coming from...and it stops
<Ingwaz> and then it starts to rain in earnest
<Polydunami> Okay, I'm gonna go and get a quick meal
<otakon> Ingwaz: creepy man, did you call the cops to report it?
<RAWRity> anyway, it's late. Glad I could discuss gratuitous panty shots and sexism with you all! G'night!
<Polydunami> I'll be back in a few minutes
<Bluestrom_S> did anyone get a "CONGRADULATIONS" from youtube?
<otakon> night RAWRity sleep well.
<Midnight_Tempest> i want to play some D&D with people T__T... i miss doing that...

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Midnight_Tempest legendary deathclaw then ?
<Midnight_Tempest> i was playing Old World Blues and fighting those trauma harnesses and one of them said 'Hey! Who turned out the lights?'
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: lol

<Ingwaz> Silver_Streak: dont worry about it
<Bluestrom_S> I didn't hit a link or anything I just typed the name worng and got that
<Bluestrom_S> no my computer didn't say anything
<Bluestrom_S> I'm using chrome
<otakon> Bluestrom_S: run a scan
<Midnight_Tempest> legendary... deathclaw... DO NOT WANT!!
<Ingwaz> what antivirus do you use Bluestrom_S?
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: Legendary Cazador is WORSE!!!!
<Midnight_Tempest> T_T
<Midnight_Tempest> i know
<AttackWithHugs> Anybody knows where I can find MLP stickers without having to buy a coloring/activity book?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Midnight_Tempest ohh come one killing those is part of the fun ~
<Bluestrom_S> I don't have one :(
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: also, Legenday Bloatfly can kill in 2 hits...

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> jajajja
<RAWRity> http://i13.mangareader.net/berserk/307/berserk-823725.jpg
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wait hahaha
<Midnight_Tempest> i just killed the legendary bloatfly without getting hit
<Polydunami> Okay, that German guy was incredibly idiotic
<Silver_Streak> lol good advice
<Silver_Streak> stfu
<Silver_Streak> love that vid
<Polydunami> Let your hands do the talking
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: I had a level 35 guy with max endurance, armor, and relevant health perks and he died bc the damn thing exploded on him.
<Bluestrom_S> is zone alarm still good? I used to use that to warn me
<Silver_Streak> ..... no you let your tongue do the talking Polydunami :P
<Polydunami> :3
<Silver_Streak> ehehehe
*MelaPonie licks Silver_Streak
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: i killed it from a distance with an anti-material rifle at level 29
<Silver_Streak> OMG MELA WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY EW EW EW EW EW EW
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: yeah, me too but the explosion is Mini Nuke big
*MelaPonie licks Silver_Streak again
<Silver_Streak> AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH MAKE IT STOP EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
<MelaPonie> because something tastes good...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> legendary cazadore was annoying because i was going melee
<Silver_Streak> I DON'T TASTE LIKE CUPCAKES
<otakon> Silver_Streak: get used to it, also beware of nommers like kirzstryfe
*MelaPonie nibbles on Silver_Streak
<Wrek|Observing> 05lessen the allcaps.
<Ingwaz> Bluestrom_S: i suggest you download the following programs, all of them are free, avast antivirus, malwarebytes anti malware, super antispyware and spyware blaster
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: really? cause i was never touch by the explosion... i was also above it and in a tunnel
*MelaPonie nibbles on Silver_Streak's paw
<Silver_Streak> :( it's the royal canterlock voice... i'm having fun.
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: that's why, I had to get into the room with it
<Silver_Streak> Mel stop wrek ruined the fun...
<Midnight_Tempest> oh, lol
<otakon> Silver_Streak: Wrek|Observing doesn't like allcaps, best listen to him
<Ingwaz> avast is a fairly good free antivirus, malwarebytes is made to get rid of the particularly nasty viruses, and the other two programs get rid of spyware which tracks what you do on your computer
<Polydunami> It doesn't translate well in the chat room
<MelaPonie> who did what?
*DeadpoolDash http://youtu.be/L-Ui5Suk7q0 ...click if you dare
<Wrek|Observing> 05that excuse never works, feel free to continue, but dont effign allcaps 4 sentences in a row
<otakon> DeadpoolDash: so help me.
<Silver_Streak> you already pooped the party might as well not play anymore..
<Silver_Streak> :(
<Polydunami> Okay, that's not the only way to have fun now
<Silver_Streak> that was the worst killjoy in the world...
<Midnight_Tempest> i think i remember only coming across 2 legendary monsters in F:NV... the bloatfly and... radscorpion? i think...

<Rain> why do they all ask you to 720p? do they get money for it or something?
<AttackWithHugs> Do they have any pony vids for Spyro music?
<AttackWithHugs> Rain: 720p is hi-def
<Midnight_Tempest> still... New Vegas wins the creepy fight with the Vashta Narada ref...
<CupcakeWarrior> Rain: 720p is HD
<Rain> I know that
<Rain> but why do they care so much that you watch it in that?
<CupcakeWarrior> HD looks good thats why
<AttackWithHugs> Mainly because it looks better. But sometimes it takes a while to buffer on that setting
<emangamer> Rain: because it actually has higher sound quality in HD
<Silver_Streak> lol dat pinkie
<Rain> not in my experiences but w/e
<MahBoi777> if I cud make just one suggestion about lag lol http://youtu.be/ZcP9jiCbakw
<AttackWithHugs> Same applies to 1080p but it makes my videos lag by a second
<homage> This is so peaceful 0.0
<Midnight_Tempest> the quality in sound between 480 and 720 is hard to tell sometimes
<CupcakeWarrior> These kinds of video must take a while to make
<emangamer> Rain: very few songs do, but I've seen a few where it REALLY does make a dif
*Rain shruge

<Placebo> Horseapples. They're offering them a job, and a 100k.
<MahBoi777> Placebo: it would reveal their secret identity
<Phase4> Placebo: internet cred
<DeadpoolDash> hey jackasses, put your heads in the cockroaches and have an interview

<RanDT1> ROFL
<RainBroDash> 10WOT
<Placebo> WTFBerserk: What's going on?
<Placebo> The Meme one is the best.
<Dashie_Dashie> da faq?
<Mutterguy> it's late.. we're bored. no new episodes
<dshannon> -_-
<Phase4> gtfo
<WTFBerserk> So, it's late at night here, aye? I like to consider myself an intelligent individual.
<Snuffsis> Mutterguy: It's early. But still bored. :/
<Mutterguy> it's late for me
<WTFBerserk> And being intelligent means being aware of ones surroundings, correct?
<Kencolt> We wait for the next pony. And, well...
<WTFBerserk> Well, I come from a place where people are incredibly...
<WTFBerserk> bad.
<dshannon> -_-
<Placebo> I have the weirdest stick boner right now.
<Kencolt> No. Being inteligent does NOT mean being aware all the time.
<Phase4> so much wut
<applejack096> wtf just happened
<WTFBerserk> So over the years, I've come to the conclusion that "good" people are hard to come by.
<RainBroDash> 10pachelbel :D
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol dat Mario Bros. theme
<Mutterguy> that's wisdom. Gary gygax said so.
<WTFBerserk> More specifically, good girls.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02He did it with the horn :3
<Snuffsis> haha
<Dark__Horst> unicorn barf
<Snuffsis> Awesome relaxing music
<GrimGallop> True. Wisdom governs your power of perception.

<Capn_fisty> Ahhh yeah, time for noodle sammich
<WTFBerserk> And I'm sick of seeing guys and people just...
<Placebo> Catchphrase is best catchphrase.
<WTFBerserk> throwing their lives and chances away.
<dshannon> okay then.......
<WTFBerserk> Or better yet.
<WTFBerserk> Sick of dumb girls.
<Kencolt> Then look around. Nothing is certain. Everything is possible.
<Kencolt> OK. Define dumb.
<Wrek|Observing> 05SB: meme one if you please.
<Placebo> ^^^^^^^6
<RainBroDash> 10Nothing is true, everything is permitted.
<WTFBerserk> You know, the girl that continuously goes for the idiots, the scumbags, the...
<Snuffsis> You an assassin?!
<WTFBerserk> looks.
<RainBroDash> 10:O
<Kencolt> In other words, the one who isn't you. There's really only one way to deal with that... and simply, deal with that.
<WTFBerserk> I get that.
<Placebo> I love blue.
<Snuffsis> Maaaaaaam
<BronyinJapan> fav ep
<WTFBerserk> And honestly, that's better than "Oh she's out there, man. There's that girl just waiting for you to come along, sweep her up, and shtuff."
<Kencolt> It's entirely possible you may be making the same mistakes you consider them to be doing. There's no such thing as a perfect ANYTHING.
<Snuffsis> Red is awesome
<dshannon> -_-
<ThatsAShinySky> Hey y'alp.

<WTFBerserk> I am under the belief that "Nice guys finish last."
<Snuffsis> nice landing
<dshannon> what
<Kencolt> Or, for that matter, different mistakes. Which you are not aware of. If you were aware-- well, you wouldn't be making those mistakes.
<Placebo> These faces.

<WTFBerserk> Okay. Anyone who's actually wanting to talk to me, I guess message me. :3
<dshannon> how does this help get the internet back....
<GrimGallop> What.
<Kencolt> I am under the belief that "I shall live my life with love and tolerance", and I did that LONG before the show ever existed. To me, life is NOT a race.
<Rain> win
<Starflash> Kencolt, welcome to the club of satisfied people.
<Wrek|Observing> 05not that im not listening WTF, jsut that im unable to respond
<Placebo> ^
<Placebo> It's 4:30 in the morning, I shouldn't be giving relationship advice.
<WTFBerserk> Basically, I believe that, as a "nice/good" guy, I have no chance in hell in getting a girl.
<Dashie_Dashie> which one has the dashie face?
<Phase4> wot
<Phase4> Fffuuuuuu
<WTFBerserk> And I am utterly close to giving in to..
<Kencolt> I'm 54, have bad teeth, a damaged nervous system and an artificial hip. And I'm okay with that.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Here's the best one
<WTFBerserk> Bad thoughts.
<Wrek|Observing> 05i dunno the name of it
<Placebo> Mmm, slurpies.
<RainBroDash> 10WTFBerserk honestly all I did was just turn around and say 'fuck the world' because I realised I was so much better than 98% of the people :D. I mean I have no advice aside from that I personally learned that people fucking suck, and you've gotta remember you're the best guy evar and shit
<Placebo> RainBroDash: Dat ego :o
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I thought I was your favorite ;____;
<Kencolt> No, WTF< what you believe is You can't get the HOT POPULAR GIRL. Been there, done that, and the HPG is rarely worth it.
<WTFBerserk> I actually HAVE done that.
<RainBroDash> 10placebo, uJelly :D
<WTFBerserk> In terms of fucking the world.
<Placebo> RainBroDash: You know me so well! :D
<RainBroDash> 10so then what's the problem?
<Wrek|Observing> 05srsly SB, play the dashie face one before you stop these
<WTFBerserk> I'm just having a problem staying that way.
<Phase4> tripple chrimeacide?
<Kencolt> Ther's hope for him yet.
<RainBroDash> 10what's the problem with it?

<WTFBerserk> And to be honest, I did try going for the 'hot popular girl', or moreso the 'hot indecisive popular cunt'.
<Placebo> Greatest.

<WTFBerserk> I get that, Ken, but it's just so frutstrating and depressing seeing all the girls you've crushed on, the girls you never knew you had a chance with, all go through horrible things.
<Dark__Horst> we just hafta watch all of them
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Pony time
<WTFBerserk> And then have nothing you can do about it and just... basically sit there ina sort of stasis.

<valoreins> i got a college assignment, i'm gonna draw a derpy reference in that assignment :p
<Kencolt> Snuffsis-- since this was WRITTEN for the Italian version of FiM, unlikely.
<Snuffsis> Sometimes it feels like Dari is a bot, he just spams EQD posts. :/
<RainBroDash> 10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOT3pmynZlY do eet f0gg0t.
<Placebo> I'm not even sure what the song is, but I want to download it.
<Dark__Horst> i just read that aslan in narnia got played by liam neeson.... dude....
<Snuffsis> Kencolt: Well it certainly sounds EXACTLY like one of the songs we listened to. :P
<MASF123> Let me help you out of your chair, Grandma!!! GRANDMA, what was it liiiike? To live on the holiday sign? That day I awoke from under my bed, I heard unknown voices screaming. LIIIFE'S IIIIIINSAAAAAANE

<RoseyPony> hehe thats awesome
<Starflash> RainBroDash It's expanding O_O
<WTFBerserk> So no happily married guys here? xD I imagine it'd be just a little odd for a man like that to be watching... this.
*RainBroDash is having an ubiquitous moment
<Placebo> WTFBerserk: There are a few.
<MASF123> No...not married. T_T
<Mutterguy> it's like the pure essence of jigglypuff
<Phase4> ...ghost rider sequel
<Phase4> why???
<Phase4> ad's on tv here
<Snuffsis> I'm married to Fluttershy, so watching MLP FIM is the only time i get to see mai waifu
<dshannon> ....so tired now
<Kencolt> Heh. I've had relationships in my youth-- good ones. Never actually would up married, and a good thing too -- I'd probably make (As my sister once said) a great father but a rotten husband.
<RainBroDash> 10OH NO
<WTFBerserk> Hm.
<RainBroDash> 10uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<MASF123> Eww...@Snuffsis
<dshannon> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<dshannon> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<dshannon> okay then.......
<RainBroDash> 10aeiou
<Phase4> here comes another chinese earthquake
<Kencolt> But more than a few Bronies are married, and happy, and well, successful in the marry thing.
<GrimGallop> o.o

<dshannon> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<RainBroDash> 10uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Dashie_Dashie> Snakes? SNAKES!
<RainBroDash> 10SNAAAA-KE
<Snuffsis> MASF123: Got a problem ?!
<Dashie_Dashie> aaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<dshannon> -_-
<RoseyPony> O-o
<MASF123> No, it is just gross is all Snuffsis
<dshannon> okay then.......
<WTFBerserk> Well, my question is, is it really true that... women, once they've matured and such, once they've "had their fun", it may or may not b a little more difficult to procure a morally decent person of a wife?
<dshannon> -_-
<Dashie_Dashie> brbrbrbrbrbrbbrbrbrbrbr
<WTFBerserk> Basically, this:
<WTFBerserk> Does "being good" really pay off in the end? From all I've seen, all being good gets is a fucked up vagina and an unfaithful wife. Good guys finish last, eh?
<RoseyPony> Derpy :)
<MASF123> Lalalalala
<Snuffsis> WTFBerserk: It's been proven that being a douchebag makes you more succesful in life, so take what you will from that fact.
<Dashie_Dashie> WTFBeserk, This is why I have stayed out of a relationship for 3 years now.
<RanDT1> Hmmm we haven't been la la la ed in a while Sb
<Snuffsis> (on average)
<Dashie_Dashie> almost 2 years out of highschool, still no girlfriend.
<Dashie_Dashie> I'mokwiththis.jpeg
<Kencolt> THAT, WTF, is a question that we are not really qualified to answer. We're NOT a philosopher's guild. We're not a romance advice service... we're a pack of lunatics (at times) who follow two ideas...
<Snuffsis> I'm 23, last girlfriend i had was about 7 years ago. T_T
<MASF123> Atleast you had a girl
*applejack096 is bored and wants to be talked to she is ill and missing school
<WTFBerserk> How've you coped?
<Placebo> I like to think it boils down to where your looking.
<Snuffsis> I got my right hand
<MASF123> Art of the dress
<Snuffsis> That's how i 've coped
<Placebo> Snuffsis: TMI, man.
<Dashie_Dashie> No girlfriend, No drama, No problem.. well that's how I see it seeing as every chica where I live causes Drama.
<Dashie_Dashie> my last ex-girlfriends BFF almost stabbed me
<Snuffsis> I don't really need a girlfriend to be happy.
<RanDT1> DAWWWW!!!!
<Placebo> ;.;
<Dashie_Dashie> because I broke up with her friend -__--
<Kencolt> One. Love and Tolerate. Friendship-- in life can be magic. and it's not a BAD idea to be a decent person. And two- Hell YAEH, ponies can be awesome. Take from that what you will.
<MASF123> True, women do have their downfalls too
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Since it is the 29th...
<Phase4> who's read the fanfic where luna comes to ponyvile and then stuff happens and then the mane 6 + luna form two bands and compete?

<applejack096> daaaaaw
