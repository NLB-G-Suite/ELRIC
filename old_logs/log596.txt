<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The 8-bit Universal logo at the beginning of the film was Edgar Wright's idea; it was then designed by his brother Oscar Wright, the concept designer and storyboard artist on the film. The logo seen in the final film was actually only a first-draft. It was not yet considered finished when test screenings began, but audiences reacted so positively to it that it
<Silverscreen> 1,11was decided that no further work need be done.
