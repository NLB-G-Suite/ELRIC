<SilverSonic> im on android on my desktop via logmein
<fillyfillyy> but SB is a mod and reg on LS so there is only 10 people over there
<Armageddon> apparently the year 8/9/10s and others have been telling the year 7s to stay away from me
<Armageddon> because I'll "scare the shit out of them and enjoy it"
<Armageddon> nice SilverSonic
<tematric> doesn't chanserv have a kick all command? just use it to narrow the list down

<Armageddon> I'm not /that/ scary IRL
<tematric> does anybody use the livestream chat?
<Armageddon> apparently I also walk around glaring at my laptop screen
<Drake> 04You're not actually
<Armageddon> with a "I'm going to kill anyone who talks to me" expression
<fillyfillyy> yes
<Armageddon> exactly
<Simon2> yus
<Armageddon> which is why I don't see why people think I'm scary
<Drake> 04In fact you actually look rather meek
<Armageddon> pretty much
<Drake> 04Probably because you're tiny
<Drake> 04Tiny little NS
<Armageddon> hah
<Armageddon> yet I'm a black belt in taekwondo

<Armageddon> doing to an anal parent sending you to tutoring
<Drake> 04Doesn't mean I can't mindlessly hate it.
*Drake continues to hate Maths
<Armageddon> I actually don't mind most of maths
<Armageddon> just not anything to do with geometry
<Drake> 04I despise it
<Armageddon> or co-ordinate geometry
<Armageddon> http://www.a-levelmathstutor.com/chainrule.php
<Drake> 04With a passion that can burn through time and space
<Armageddon> nah
<Drake> 04I simply have yet to harness it's full potential
<Armageddon> its
<Armageddon> Drake
<Armageddon> I have to write a 1000-word creative writing piece
<Armageddon> with some form of relationships inside it
<Drake> 04That's easy
<Armageddon> mmhm
<Armageddon> I have no inspiration atm though
<Armageddon> which means it's not easy
<Drake> 04I'm not sure if I should re-write mine.
*Drake headdesks
<Armageddon> Well
<Armageddon> I'm planning to do something about Rhy/Nathan/Leo
<Drake> 04I figured I'd use Monday's emo-ness and turn it into a story
<Drake> 04OH SWEET
<Armageddon> I just don't know what
<Drake> 04Make them go to a theme park
<Armageddon> essentially it IS a relationship
<Armageddon> nah
<Drake> 04Then get into trouble
<Armageddon> you did that
<Armageddon> I need to think of something else
<Drake> 04Then Rhy and Nathan fall on each other
<Drake> 04and it's awkward
<Armageddon> maybe I'll get them to go to a sweet shop
*Drake runs
<Armageddon> Rhy'll get high
<Drake> 04yessssssssssss
<Armageddon> dunno
<Armageddon> it's autobiographical
<Armageddon> must involve a real relationship
<Armageddon> has to be a completed story
<Armageddon> explores insights into the relationship
<Armageddon> displays creative writing skills
<Drake> 04wat
<Drake> 04autobiographical
<Drake> 04why
<Drake> 04By "relationship" does it mean lovey-dovey or any sort of relationship?
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04If it's the latter, do you and the Hensh
*Drake RUNS
<Armageddon> it doesn't have to be about myself
<Armageddon> and
<Armageddon> FUCK NO
<Armageddon> it's any sort of relationship
<Drake> 04Do May and I then
<Armageddon> fuck no
<Drake> 04That would be amusing
<Armageddon> I'll just do Rhy/Nathan/Leo
<Armageddon> since that's TECHNICALLY real
<Armageddon> because they're essentially me, you and Xeli
<Armageddon> and we have a relationship of sorts
<Drake> 04sweet
<Drake> 04Just say you used alias' due to sensitive information
<Armageddon> yeah
<Drake> 04aliases
<Drake> 04alias'
<Armageddon> I was planning to do that
<Drake> 04w/e
<Armageddon> autobiographical though
<Armageddon> anything that entails?
<Drake> 04We all fucked at some point
<Armageddon> hah
<Drake> 04Start at how w first met
<Drake> 04we*
<Armageddon> it's 1000-1200 words
<Armageddon> which is technically easy for this genre
<Drake> 04Write a lemon
<Drake> 04About us and Xeli
<Drake> 04But in all seriousness do us three
<Armageddon> what I'm mostly concerned about is the creative writing thing
<Armageddon> ...
<Drake> 04Start with how you met Xeli
<Armageddon> I'm handing this in to my english teacher
<Drake> 04Then how you met me
<Armageddon> I'm sure he wants to read lemons
<Drake> 04And what we we've been through
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> it's 1000-1200 words
<Drake> 04Not too hard
<Armageddon> I can't write /that/ much in that many words
<Drake> 04Just don't expand upon the details
<Armageddon> fuck, you know how much I struggle with short stories
<Armageddon> and I need details for this
<Drake> 04And cover "introduced me to 4chan" with "showed me wondrous new sights"
<Armageddon> I'm concerned about the "showing not telling" thing though
<Armageddon> hell no
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04Help me then
<Armageddon> what
<Drake> 04I need to write a creative writing piece
<Drake> 04excess of 600 words
<Armageddon> write a drabble
<Armageddon> but urgh
<Drake> 04Either about "Going Home," "The Best Summer Ever," or with the opening line "Everywhere they went people seemed to chat with them"
<Drake> 04It needs to be about a journey
*Drake headdesks
<Armageddon> that's easy
<Armageddon> write a drabble
<Armageddon> how about you write mine and I write yours :D
<Drake> 04Hmm
<Drake> 04Tempting
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> I'm more suited to what you're writing
<Armageddon> I can think of a few things with going home
<Armageddon> or the last opening line thing
<Drake> 04So
<Drake> 04Autobiographical
<Drake> 04About relationships
<Drake> 041000-1200 words
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> I'm not sure we should
<Armageddon> since technically school rules and misconduct shit
<Armageddon> but it'd be fun
<Drake> 04How would they find out?
<Armageddon> >internet
<Drake> 04That's why we don't post them on the internet
<Drake> 04:I
<Armageddon> hey I knoooooooooow
<Drake> 04But I dunno
<Armageddon> I'll write about our bowling experience
<Drake> 04I'm not sure what relationship to write from your perspective
<Drake> 04YES
<Drake> 04DO IT
<Armageddon> not sure /how/ to write it though
<Drake> 04And now I have 9 more exercises to do
<Drake> 04by Friday
<Drake> 04fuck me
<Drake> 04at least this stuff is easy
<Drake> 04"Evaluate: -2 + 3"
*Armageddon fucks Drake
<Drake> 04GEE I DUNNO
*Drake cums
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> 1!
<Armageddon> dunno Drake
<Armageddon> it needs to have a real plot
<Armageddon> so the bowling thing is a bit hard
<Radu> ?
<Armageddon> and I have a feeling this should be the sort of thing which has ZOMG WRITING SKILLZ instead of humourish dialogue
<Placebo> ohai Radu
<Radu> Hi Placebo c:
<Armageddon> which is /not/ fun
<Placebo> http://www.livestream.com/superbrony64
<Placebo> Link to the stream.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Thanks for tuning in everypony ^_^
<Jim> Good morning everyone
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Morning Jim
<Drake> 04"The difficulty portraying the magnitude of my nervousness was beyond mortal comprehension. Using the phrase "my knees were shaking" would be the understatement of the millenium. The bridge seemed longer than anything I'd ever seen before, and the people that crowded around me like ants on their daily commute had not the slightest inkling of the anxiety that shook me to my very core."
<Drake> 04That was easy.
<Placebo> Bed time, Sb?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02FOOD TIME
<Placebo> oh. rite.
<Placebo> It's already 1:40.. your an hour late.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:<
<Placebo> Go eat your tacos. You deserve 'em.
<Armageddon> well
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You're mah friend :3
*Placebo hugs
<Armageddon> my teacher was like
<Placebo> And get your sibling to go to sleep.
<Drake> 04I hate how I can't pull off Purple Prose when I write seriously like I can when I don't even try.
<DoctorTimeyWimey> ...
<Simon> Mah Boi
<DoctorTimeyWimey> No
<Simon> Now this chat is active again
*Polydunami is going to a funeral tomorrow
<Polydunami> Busy day
<Placebo> Sorry to hear that.
<DoctorTimeyWimey> I feel like I'm at a pool and adult swim just ended.
<Jim> Oh, take care Polydunami
<Placebo> I miss the old Adult swim pool commercials :$
<Placebo> wrong face >.>
<DoctorTimeyWimey> I miss the old adult swim
<Polydunami> I'm gonna go and rest up for the big day
<Placebo> Sealab 2021? lol
<Placebo> Polydunami: Sleep tight. Hope everything goes smoothly.
<Armageddon> "the leaves fell forlornly as the wind howled through the branches, and rain poured in torrents, drenching the figure huddled beneath the tree, her legs drawn to her chest in a withdrawn demeanour. tears cascaded down her cheeks, washed away by the heavy rain and sinking into the soft mud like a tremendous weight."
<Armageddon> and then he was like
<Armageddon> "the girl was sad"
<Polydunami> Everything will be fine
<Drake> 04Why are you always so depressing
<Polydunami> I'll be back
<Drake> 04XD
<Placebo> mfw my roommate sounds like a motorboat
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm going to stram some TV shows :3
<Placebo> yay
<Drake> 04That's actually a good contrast
<Armageddon> and then he was like "which one's better? the first one is showing and the second is telling but they both have the same meaning"
<Armageddon> and well the first one was similar to his but I can't remember what he said so I just made that up
<Armageddon> and yeah it is
<Armageddon> so basically
<Drake> 04Have a really profligate paragraph, then next paragraph have a single, simple line like that
<Armageddon> this is about writing SKILLZ
<Armageddon> eh
<Jim> Why do I always forget my headset at home? ^^
<Drake> 04JUXTAPOSITION
<Armageddon> true
<Armageddon> but still
<Armageddon> I'm going to write this in 3rd person
<Armageddon> can't stand 1st person
<Drake> 041st person is alright
<Drake> 04But I hate anything other than past tense
<Drake> 04I can /somewhat/ do present tense
<Drake> 04But not very well
<Armageddon> present tense is HARD
<Armageddon> but it's really effective if you can pull it off
<Drake> 04MMM
<Drake> 04Goddamn caps
<Armageddon> Peace.
<Armageddon> It is the very epitome of the world that young Dantius Palpatine lives in. He knows not to take it for granted, for it is a lost concept amongst the beings of the galaxies, but Naboo is one of the planets that treasures it, and keeps it safe in the confines of its knowing mind. His homeworld is a peaceful planet indeed; war has never been seen before, at least not on it.
<Armageddon> But of course, Dantius has seen war. He has seen it destroy entire planets, and ravage the once beautiful landscapes that encompassed their very cores. The battle-weary warriors who sought refuge on his planet were always granted refuge and promised safety amongst its beautiful green fields and clear blue skies.
<Drake> 04AAAAAAAAAAH STAR WARS FANFICS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Drake> 04Yes I remember this one
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04You wrote it
<Armageddon> that's old
<Armageddon> I barely got halfway through the first chapter
<Armageddon> present tense isn't my style
<Armageddon> too hard
<Armageddon> past tense and present tense are very different
<Armageddon> anyway Drake
<Armageddon> I think I have an idea

*Placebo watches
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Go to http://www.livestream.com/sillyfilly123
<Placebo> Did we break bronystate?
<Drake> 04but hey
<Drake> 04Continue
<Armageddon> Basically
<Jim> Hmm.. My internet is too poor to view the stream it seems. If it's up that is
<Armageddon> Rhy is upset and depressed and runs away and hides in a cupboard and mopes
<Armageddon> while Nathan and Leonard try to find her
<Jim> No wait, I just got it
<Drake> 04:O
<Drake> 04Why is Rhy upset
<Armageddon> dunno
<Armageddon> I'll decide that later
<Armageddon> I am apparently writing this in present tense
<Drake> 04LEO CALLED HER FAT
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> She listens to their footsteps as they echo through the corridor.
<Armageddon> The cupboard is full of dust and grime and mould and it makes her sneeze but she is too afraid to and she just doesn't want to be heard or seen. The darkness inside is comforting and a safe haven from the prying eyes and ears of the world outside, but the constant fear of that one comfort taken away from her is oh-so-terrifying.
<Phase4> ohai
<Armageddon> er
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai
<Armageddon> need to fix the last sentence
<Armageddon> but that's what I have so far
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Go to http://www.livestream.com/sillyfilly123
<Placebo> ^
<Jim> ohai Phase4
<Drake> 04The first sentence needs more commas
<Armageddon> probably should have a being in the last sentence
<Armageddon> no Drake, I intentionally left no commas to make it have a rushed effect
<Phase4> awww, still on the livestream
<Drake> 04ah
<Armageddon> like you read/say it in one breath
<Armageddon> to make it sound like she's on the verge of panic
<Armageddon> thus all the and's
<Drake> 04nicely done
<Armageddon> xD thanks
<Drake> 04I need to put more techniques like that into my writing
<Drake> 04I'm too rigid in my style
<Armageddon> haha
<Armageddon> The cupboard is full of dust and grime and mould and it makes her almost sneeze but she is too afraid to and she just doesn't want to be heard or seen. The darkness inside is comforting and a safe haven from the prying eyes and ears of the world outside, but the constant fear of that one comfort being taken away from her is oh-so-terrifying. It is quite musty inside.
<Armageddon> last sentence
<Drake> 04Show don't tell
<Drake> 04:I
<Armageddon> it's just like zomg serious and then suddenly "it's musty"
<Drake> 04But eh
<Drake> 04hah
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> dunno
<Drake> 04And
<Drake> 04As a question
<Armageddon> it's already implied that it's old
<Drake> 04How old is Rhy because she sounds really young here
<Drake> 04Just the language used
<Armageddon> dunno
<Armageddon> probably 7 in this
<Drake> 04H-uh
<Drake> 04Didn't realise they knew each other as kids
<Armageddon> this is a severe exaggeration of me snapping in china 2-3 years ago
<DoctorTimeyWimey> everyone say SuperBrony64 2:30 c:
<Drake> 04:/
<Placebo> SuperBrony64: 6:30 c:
<DoctorTimeyWimey> ...
<DoctorTimeyWimey> NO D:<
<DoctorTimeyWimey> Placebo: You are not my friend.
<Placebo> :(
<DoctorTimeyWimey> You are the weakestlink, goodbye
<DoctorTimeyWimey> :O
<HeavyMetalDash> make me!
<Jim> ohai HeavyMetalDash
<Armageddon> XD
<HeavyMetalDash> hey Jim whats goig o?
<Armageddon> 'twas silly really
<HeavyMetalDash> *on?
<Jim> Sitting at school, not having any classes for a cupple of hours
<Drake> 04You still wanna tell me about it so I don't worry?
<JettStream> sounds neat
<Simon2> lol
<HeavyMetalDash> damn it's like four in the morning over here :D
<Simon2> It's 6pm
<Placebo> ^
<JettStream> 11 am
<Armageddon> it was nothing Drake
<Armageddon> I just got pissed and threw a tantrum
<HeavyMetalDash> I was pretty much just checking in on everypony but chat seems dead and I'm kinda tired from working all night :P
<Armageddon> then locked myself in the bathroom/toilet
<Phase4> http://www.livestream.com/sillyfilly123 << sb's streaming here, i need to reboot. brb
<Drake> 04Using the word "snap" doesn't ooze confidence, but I'll take your word for it.
<JettStream> well goodnight HeavyMetalDash
<Jim> Going to sleep now then?
<HeavyMetalDash> lol yeah I'm thinking i'll try despite my avid and relentless insomnia
<HeavyMetalDash> I kinda wanna play my gee-tar but I'll wake the neighbores if I do...curse my limited options!!!
<Jim> Haha :D
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> yay Drake
<Armageddon> She shivers with fear as the 'thump-thump' of footsteps draw ever closer. She can feel her heart racing as they are silenced, then there is another 'thump', and then more silence. There is a loud clattering of pots and pans and then a curse and the feet move away and she releases the breath she didn't realise she has been holding.
<Armageddon> "Come on, Nathan, Rhy isn't here. She probably ran outside."
<Armageddon> She shrinks back as the deep baritone voice cuts through the silence in her mind, and then perks up as the next voice replies. "I know she's here, Leo, I saw her come in. I know Rhy well, she'll be in here somewhere. The question is where."
<Armageddon> might change the last sentence in that first paragraph that I posted just then
<Armageddon> don't really like it
<Armageddon> and I don't really like that paragraph but eh
<Drake> 04change "and" to "as"
<Drake> 04?*
<Armageddon> ah
<Armageddon> well, as isn't that suited for that sentence
<Armageddon> I'll probably rewrite it
<Armageddon> and lol Xeli's voice as baritone
<HeavyMetalDash> well I'm off for a few hours to try and sort things out it was nice talking with you all even if it was a short lived experience :)
<Armageddon> I just can't really be bothered to list it as something else
<HeavyMetalDash> goodnight
<Jim> good night heavy
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> Still
<Armageddon> it's amusing
<Armageddon> I've worked out a semi-storyline
<Armageddon> Rhy is pissed at Leonard and ran and hid somewhere
<Armageddon> and then Leo and Nathan go to find her
<Armageddon> Leo goes outside to look because he thinks she isn't in the kitchen/cellar/whatever but nathan looks
<Armageddon> and then Rhy thinks about it, gets angry, squashes a bug against the wall and thus revealing her position
<Armageddon> 'it' being the series of events that occurred beforehand
<Armageddon> and then Nathan finds her
<Armageddon> she tries to hit him
<Armageddon> but eventually calms down enough to talk
<Drake> 04'naaaaw
<Armageddon> XD
<Espeon|School> oo
<Placebo> Sleep tight everyone.
<Armageddon> hm Drake
<Drake> 04You ARE capable of writing something cute
<Drake> 04Also hi Xeli
<Armageddon> what could Leo have said that would have offended Rhy?
<Armageddon> hah
<Armageddon> I'm capable of a lot of things
<Armageddon> doesn't mean I like doing them though
<Jim> good night plac
*Armageddon slaps Drake
<Drake> 04I dunno
<Armageddon> need to go in a minute
<Drake> 04Rhy is roughly 7 here so
*Drake avoids
<Drake> 04D:
*Drake hugs
<Armageddon> She can imagine Nathan nodding and Leonard going outside, and thinks that the latter ought to have tried harder to find her. After all, he had told her that she shouldn't
<Drake> 04Maybe Leo looked at her diary?
<Armageddon> oh yeah
<Armageddon> that's a good one
<Armageddon> and it relays the fact that my mum once looked at something private of mine
<Armageddon> so it makes sense in relations to real-world stuff
<Armageddon> thanks Drake
<Drake> 04No prob
<Armageddon> After all, he had gone into her room and taken her little book of all-her-secrets and then read it and then laughed.
*Armageddon removes the laugh bit
<Armageddon> After all, he had gone into her room and taken her little book of all-her-secrets and then read it and taken it again.
<Armageddon> that's a bit better
<Armageddon> as little sense as that makes
<Drake> 04XD
<Phase4> It Worked!
<Jim> What worked?
<Armageddon> She wants the little book back with all its pretty drawings and stickers but Leo won't be giving anything back after he has taken it.
<Phase4> fixing windows from linux
<Armageddon> the last part is a bit weird Drake
<Armageddon> any suggestions?
<Armageddon> damn tense
<Phase4> i ran the recovery image in qemu and set the vm's hard drive to mine
<Drake> 04XD
<Jim> ooh, neat
<Armageddon> Oh no, she knows that Leonard has it and will keep it until she gives him what he wants which she does not know about and would not like to know about.
<Drake> 04"She wants the little book back with all its pretty drawings and stickers but Leo won't be giving anything back after how she acted/after he takes it."
<Drake> 04Not sure
<Armageddon> hm
<Armageddon> I'll figure it out later
<Drake> 04:/
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Now Playing: Futurama
<Phase4> futurama is on here too
<Armageddon> But oh, she so wants the little book back!
<Armageddon> The fly's remains hit the wall.

<dashiee> hello everypony
<Jim> ohai dashiee
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi.
<Radu> Hi dashiee
<Kammerjunk> Avê, dashiee.
<dashiee> broadcast offline :(
<Jim> Oh lawd, I found that gummy bear. 32000 calories o_O
<Kammerjunk> But seriously. I liked the conversations in #Twilight_Sparkle D: And now it's an invite only room.
<dashiee> invite only room?
<Radu> Really?!
<Kammerjunk> It says so to me in the console.
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - the pony rooms are being turned off during the week
<Jim> Yeah, according to the news letter it will be so FOREVER. Except for during the new episodes stream
<MirrorImage> not enough moderators to cover them all
<Kammerjunk> ForEVEEERRRR
<Kammerjunk> I thought that was why they hired new mods?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, well. The conversations weren't always THAT good, anyway.
<Thunderpony> Why can't i go into the twilight chat?
<Radu> Nah, like 4-5 of the old mods were inactive
<MirrorImage> yes, but they didn't hire enough mods to cover 7 different channels 24/7
<Thunderpony> I'm stuck in the main chat
<pony_3583> When does streaming start again?
<MirrorImage> Thunderpony - Pony Chats are turned off during the week now
<Kammerjunk> Thunderpony: Apparently, the Mane 6 are invite-only except for new episode streams.
<MirrorImage> pony_3583 - when one of the streamers finally wakes up
<Thunderpony> :[ WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
<Kammerjunk> Radu: Speaking of which, where IS Vi anyway?
<MirrorImage> there's not enough moderators to cover 7 different channels
<MirrorImage> so instead, those 6 are being turned off and everyone gets shunted here during the week
<Turgle> eeeeeyup
<Radu> Meh, the Mane 6 rooms were awkwardly quiet
<Thunderpony> Why not just have 1 mod for each?
<Radu> At least the RD room
<Thunderpony> And when that mod goes to sleep turn the room off
<Kammerjunk> I remember some quite good conversations in the Twilight room at BMN.
<Thunderpony> Hmm
<Kammerjunk> For example, we ended up talking about the nature of the universe for some reason at that film with John Coffey the Magical Black Man.
<Jim> Atleast activating them for BMN would be nice
<dashiee> well its twilight room they all need to be wise in there :P
<otakon> hello bronystate!
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, otakon.
<Jim> hi otakon
<Radu> Hi otakon
<Turgle> hi otakon !
<otakon> damn
<otakon> it MUST be slow
<dashiee> hello otakon
<otakon> hi guys
<Jim> What must be slow you say?
<Kammerjunk> When I was a child, I had a fever. My hands felt just like two balloons.
<TOY_PON3> Hi everypony
<Kammerjunk> Now I've got that feeling once again. I can't explain, you would not understand this is not how I am.
<Kammerjunk> Avê, TOY_PON3.
<TOY_PON3> Kammerjunk: I love that song
<TOY_PON3> :3
<Kammerjunk> Indeed.
<Jim> ohai TOY_PON3
<Kammerjunk> Though my favourite in the album is still The Trial.
<otakon> hiya TOY_PON3
<TOY_PON3> I'm going to school today! :)
<otakon> um
<otakon> yay?
<Kammerjunk> I just came back from school.
<otakon> I don't have school no more
<Jim> I got home a while ago
<otakon> I miss it
<Radu> ^
<TOY_PON3> I'm a junior :/
<dashiee> i hate school :(
<Kammerjunk> I'm not sure if what I'm in would be elementary school.
<Jim> I might be conscripted into the army this autumn
<TOY_PON3> I don't hate it, I just hate homework
<TOY_PON3> Big difference
<Kammerjunk> I have no idea for how long elementary school goes on, nor what high school is about.
<Kammerjunk> Here, we just go to one school for 10 years, and then we're free to choose.
<TOY_PON3> US schooling is just confusing
<TOY_PON3> Trust me I'm from the US
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - elementary school typically consists of up to either 5th or 6th grade (year 5/6), depending on the district
<Jim> I've never really understood the American school system
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: Ah, thanks.
<TOY_PON3> Jim: Like I said, too complicated.
<TOY_PON3> What the school system in the US wants is for all of us to become Professors but not all of us want that.
<TOY_PON3> IMO that is
<Kammerjunk> I'm going to finish primary school this year, and then I plan to attend HTX.
<otakon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7HrijDkfHc&feature=player_embedded#!
<Kammerjunk> Which is a lot simpler, in my opinion.
<otakon> watch that and laugh your ass off
<TOY_PON3> I feel pretty bad sometimes though..because while most students nowadays hate school and such kids in Mexico or some other foreign place would beg to be given school
*TOY_PON3 deeply thinks
<Radu> ^
<Radu> So true
<moop> ;'(
<dashiee> i hate school but also i will hate it if i stay home the whole year
<MirrorImage> TOY_PON3 - the problem with the American School System is that it tries to teach you EVERYTHING
<TOY_PON3> dashiee: We all have our opinions my friend
<MirrorImage> when 1) not everyone wants to know everything and 2) not everyone needs to know everything
<moop> just finished MLD
<moop> :'(
<Radu> Don't spoil please
<TOY_PON3> MirrorImage: That's so true
<moop> i won't

<Discord> So far.

<otakon> um Krakass that might be a bit much
<Discord> *lead
<Sumica> 00,10pushing it a bit there Krakass
<ofna01> we should make a Bronystate group on steam
<MahBoi777> that's.....strange
<Radu> I wrote TF2 first c:
<otakon> ofna01: there is I think
<Sumica> 00,10we have one ofna01
<Dermathil> ofna01: we have one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't even view the image because of a mature filter.
<ofna01> link nao
<otakon> yh
<Dermathil> It has been around for months
<Fazana> Basically a cream pony with aliens coming out the cutie mark
<otakon> Krakass: if it's something like that, screen it by one of the mods first
<Fazana> Just contains slight gore
<otakon> that's borderline
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Any images with gore is a no-no here.
<otakon> just blood spatter really
<MahBoi777> indeed
<otakon> but rules are rules
<GLaDOS> Someone removed the options on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvgUisrDwyh9dGk2V0RJWVIyVlV4RVdVV3NCS0ozaWc#gid=0
<otakon> and they NEVER stopped using that line
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What?
<ofna01> am i missing.....an eyebrow?
<otakon> "Am I missing.....an eyebrow?"
<MahBoi777> lol
<Dermathil> can I add a suggestion on the list?
<otakon> it's Adam's catchphrase
<Fazana> I think I heard this one
<otakon> Jamie's became "Quack damn you!"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Freezing the list.
<Fazana> Yes, I heard this myth many a time
<ofna01> yeah XD
<unfoundbug> hi
<Sumica> 00,10nah his catchphrase is I reject your reality and substatute my own
<ofna01> BOOM HEADSHOT
<ofna01> :3
<unfoundbug> ooh mythbusters
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No offense, but everyone's screwing with it.
<unfoundbug> stream will be watched
<otakon> Sumica: true, but it's not his
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: sorry, I was trying to vote on the wrong bit at first
<unfoundbug> ahh this one was alright
<HeavyMetalDash> ^
<otakon> if there was ever a zombie outbreak
<otakon> these guys would be set
<ofna01> get a bucket of pennies
<ofna01> and dump it off
<Fazana> Get a bucket of gold
<Fazana> and drop it :)
<otakon> they have enough firepower and inventions for it
<ofna01> and keep it
<ofna01> ota
<unfoundbug> ota, your gonna get kicked again
<Radu> Basically, TF2 got 3 votes
<otakon> unfoundbug: why?
<ofna01> first place i would be heading is to to adam and hamie
<otakon> that's ofna01 posting all that
<ofna01> jamie*
<unfoundbug> ah, 5 not 6
<otakon> in 10 seconds
<unfoundbug> one more message and dari would of cuased rage
<unfoundbug> are you counting now?
<otakon> um no
<otakon> but they're spaced out enough I don't have to worry about it for the moment
<Krakass> I was going to vote for battlefield
<ofna01> hell no
<unfoundbug> what is there a vote on?
<ofna01> battlefield is boring for livestreams
<Fazana> Jamie is bemused
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll likely take Battlefield off. I'm not a fan of the game honestly.
<ofna01> /)
<Fazana> Battlefield and CoD - parp
<Sumica> 00,10*pat pat* that's great
<ofna01> -_-
<Radu> Do what you want, Nittany
<Dermathil> I support taking Battlefield out of it...
<Radu> ^
<ofna01> ---_---
<otakon> ofna01: agreed, spawn, immediately die from super sniper
<ofna01> yep

<Radu> xD
<otakon> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've rarely had fun in a BF game.
<ofna01> only reason i play BF3 is for vehicles
<Dermathil> When you live comment and are very good it can be fun,
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Steep difficulty curve.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: bad company 2 was fun
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't like i.t
<Dermathil> but otherwise it sucks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01More rage than fun for me.
<otakon> BF: BC 2 was a GREAT game all over for me
<otakon> I should get it again
<ofna01> bf3 wasnt very good
<otakon> but I'm afraid the MP is dead by now
<ofna01> Assassins Creed Brotherhood,now THAT'S a good game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Honestly, Battlefield's MP has not been friendly to me.
<otakon> never played it
<ofna01> same here nittany
<Dermathil> Nittany, replace Battlefield with Super Meat Boy in the list pl0x
<otakon> no
<otakon> please NO
<ofna01> nope
<otakon> NO MORE SMB!
<ofna01> happy wheels

<ofna01> HAPPY WHEELS
<otakon> Sumica: agreed so MUCH
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I rage less over SMB than BF:BC2.
<Radu> QWOP gives rage
<unfoundbug> SMB streams are pretty good if a mic lets you hear the rage
<Dermathil> Sumica: SB sucks at it. You should so watch me.
<Fazana> Happy wheels - meh

<RAWRity> prince-dari: because dammit, that computer generated grease just doesn't taste as heart-attacky
<prince-dari> Can you eat holographic food? :<
<RAWRity> prince-dari: yes, but it won't do anything for you.
<Silver_Rush> i wish
<prince-dari> :<
<MahBoi777> holographic food= weight loss program
<RAWRity> Also, how awesome would it be to have video games on the holo-deck?
<Silver_Rush> lolol
<derpy_pony> they don't even have a full surveillance system on a warship?
<Silver_Rush> ahh yea tetris forever
<derpy_pony> everybody could board them
<RAWRity> derpy_pony: that's pretty much how the Enterprise works most of the time.
<Sumica> 00,10Holodeck would be the end of mand kind
<Krakass> Eww
<prince-dari> >go to holodeck
<derpy_pony> and yet they rely on eyewitnesses
<prince-dari> >make enterprise within holodeck
<prince-dari> >go into holodeck enterprise holodeck
<Vulgrim> really?
<Sumica> 00,10they did that one
<Silver_Rush> yo dog i heard you like holodecks
<RAWRity> prince-dari: and thus, we finally can make a real-life inception.
<prince-dari> They did? Aww. :<
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Shizuka> 13vgeeeeeeer
<prince-dari> >go to holodeck

<Shizuka> 13>go to vger holodeck
<Morty> anyone else hearing an annoying click?
<Shizuka> 13>play pool with ponies
<Rainbowjack> there following Ponies
<MahBoi777> die happy
<RAWRity> oh you KNOW if holo-deck existed they would make a pony mod for that in an instant.
<prince-dari> Isn't there an episode where stuff in the holodeck becomes real?
<alexxm> well i just got my provisional license
<MahBoi777> there's a pony for that
<RAWRity> but just imagine, racing games in the Holodeck.
<RAWRity> prince-dari: several
<Sumica> 00,10voyger did that alot
<Rain> so whats up everypony?
<MahBoi777> hey Rain
<Silver_Rush> i know whats going on
<Silver_Rush> alians
<Vulgrim> I wish they played a random episode of ponies
<Silver_Rush> aliens*
<Shizuka> 13well you had the doctor way later
<prince-dari> So why can't you make Earth, then make the stuff in the holodeck real?
<Sumica> 00,10also great idea dari, make equestria in a holodeck
<Shizuka> 13i can only think of a couple times where holodeck characters got out
<Vulgrim> awesome idead
<alexxm> not much just got my provisonal licencse
<Vulgrim> idea*
<MahBoi777> I'm not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens
<derpy_pony> he's a sleeper! shoot him!
<RAWRity> which mean we've essentially figured out how to create life in the future. Star Trek has killed off God. WOOT!
<Sumica> 00,10the stuff that they make real still pulls from the replecator supplys
<Pegashy> Yoooow :)
<Pegashy> back :3
<Silver_Rush> no
<MahBoi777> wb Pegashy
<RAWRity> but again, with proper energy supplies, WE CAN CREATE LIFE ARTIFICIALLY.
<Silver_Rush> no replecators pleaassee
<Rain> so, is there a show on? if so who is the host?
<alexxm> how come they never did a doctor who crossover
<Shizuka> 13ohhh this episode~
<derpy_pony> we will build better, improved gods
<Jim> Sumica is streaming Rain
<Pegashy> Gonna get a snack :D
<otakon> hiya Shizuka!
<RAWRity> alexxm: because that would futz up continuity something awful.
<derpy_pony> and wage war against them
*otakon hugs Shizuka
<derpy_pony> this will be fun
<Jim> ohai Shizuka
<Morty> dat yay
<Shizuka> 13it wants the coffee nebula all to itself
<MahBoi777> hi Shikuza
<RAWRity> also, Q would killed The Doctor for funzies.

<Sumica> 00,10suddnly ECH
<MahBoi777> robuts
<Shizuka> 13dammit man i'm a doctor not a captain
<prince-dari> >put doctor in command
<prince-dari> >computer is now in command of itself
<prince-dari> >Skynet
<prince-dari> >end of world
<Sumica> 00,10lawl
<Jim> haha
<Rainbowjack> >Terminator
<MahBoi777> lol
<RAWRity> now, here's a realy question: Who would win between teh Borg and the Daleks? EXTERMINATE vs ASSIMILATE
<Sumica> 00,10nice catch Dari
<Rainbowjack> >end of the world
<unfoundbug> prince, he gets some SERIOUS control later
<Shizuka> 13^
<Starflash> fortunately, doctor is 1,9324% human because magic
<Shizuka> 13much later but yeah
<derpy_pony> the borgs can build an assimilation singularity
<derpy_pony> the daleks can time travel
<Sumica> 00,10yeah when he gets to be a red shirt and charges the phontonic cannon
<derpy_pony> daleks win
<prince-dari> RAWRity: Kind of hard to say, but of course I'd say daleks, because <3 Doctor Who.
<RAWRity> you hear they're talking about making a new Star Trek TV series?
<unfoundbug> bad ass weapon ftw lol
<alexxm> did this series ever get a movie
<unfoundbug> photonic cannon doesnt emitany signatures
<Jim> Yes it did
<prince-dari> And because daleks are a match for time lords, and time lords are the most OP thing in the universe.
<Morty> clicking in stream is annoying
<MirrorImage> alexxm - i don't think... it did Jim?
<Rainbowjack> we<3ponies Mare-a-thon i would like to see that
<Sumica> 00,10Dalics would roffle stomp the borg unless they manage to assameulate one
<Jim> Well, not Voyager I think
<RAWRity> as I recall it, only TOS and NG got movies
<Morty> magneton
<Paarthurnax> its going to be the best Saturday morning ever

<Kammerjunk> See, this is why I love this fandom.
<Stallion_of_War> SHOOT HIM NOW
<otakon> damn
<Stallion_of_War> WHILE HE'S DISTRACTED

<Stallion_of_War> Both of them!
<Stallion_of_War> Shoot EVERYONE!
<otakon> and she's dead
<MirrorImage> "Wait... Klingon?"
<Kammerjunk> This fandom pumps out content faster than I can read, and it's fantastic,
<Sundaysmile> I like how in this nobody cares about the background extras
<Stallion_of_War> Teleports are instant.... no time???
<MahBoi777> Kammerjunk: ikr?
<Paarthurnax> background extras? What am i looking for?
<unfoundbug> kammer, it can be annoying to try to keep up when deadlines loom
<Sundaysmile> yet in mlp, there's speculation and TONNEs of backstory even for ones that don't have names
<Silver_Rush> it was the red shirt
<Sumica> 00,10no time I have to make a death speach
<otakon> and then she was human FOREVER
<MirrorImage> Stallion_of_War - the way Teleporters work, in theory it has to superheat your body to several million degrees farenheit...
<MirrorImage> ever heard of a System Shock check from dungeons and dragons?
<Kammerjunk> unfoundbug: But then afterwards, you have so much to read!
<otakon> eh, I liked her when she was half breed
<Kammerjunk> I love reading!
<otakon> ah
<unfoundbug> not really, i tend to find work gets forgotten as the reading takes over
<Paarthurnax> All this is reminding meof Galaxy Quest
<alexxm> ah the status quo
<otakon> eeyup
<Rainbowjack> she never gets rid of that part of her
<Kammerjunk> Well, on to the incomplete 19-chapter sequel.
<Kammerjunk> This is going to be a fun evening.
<Sundaysmile> now she'll be that quirky hybrid we all know and love
<Sumica> 00,10it's supposed to Galaxy quest is a paridy of Trek
<Stallion_of_War> Why does Chakotay get less gray hair as he gets older?
