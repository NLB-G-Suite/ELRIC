<Enterprize> cheers wolfman
<Ascendant> windows is quite crappy in general aspects anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I use Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03since I use a CableCard and record premium stuff
<nickstr> Linux has a huge number of faults
<Ascendant> it's slow, bloated etc.
<Silverscreen> 14nice.
<nickstr> but then again Windows also has its faults
<Ascendant> yes it does
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes, and if you haven't entered for next week's selection, feel free to do that now
<twilightboy> I love you man
<Silverscreen> 14I love the 8-bits.
<SirSprinkles> OH GOD 8 BIT
<nickstr> Mac OS also has its faults
<Ascendant> linux and windows both have their ups and downs
<Ascendant> lol macs
<SummerSong> 0YES <3
<SirSprinkles> >most played song on my iPod
<Ghosties> 4Art of the Dress, nice

<twilightboy> GOD!
<twilightboy> WINTER WRAPUP
<twilightboy> !
<Ascendant> it's purely opinion
<nickstr> it does not matter what you use
<Ghosties> 4STOP GANGING UP ON ME
<nickstr> they will all have problems
<Ascendant> bashing is a matter of opinion
<twilightboy> does anyone else get goosebumps from the songs in the show?
<Ascendant> linux is my OS of preference
<nickstr> I can't live in a Linux world
<SirSprinkles> DCD? Where be you?
<Ascendant> I've learnt to
<nickstr> my hardware will not allow it
<Ascendant> ah
<repsaj79> I've gotten a few from Eurobeat Brony's remixes.
<nickstr> my TV tuner card is not supported
<nickstr> because Video4Linux is an immature and stalled project
<Enterprize> I am really pleased with the BGM too
<Ascendant> V4L is really crap.
<SummerSong> 0oh hai spring
<nickstr> which is going nowhere fast
<twilightboy> lol
<MeteorVenture> i don't get goosebumps much.. i just smile so hard it impairs my hearing (true story)
<NewDCD> 9I'm here
<NewDCD> 9a bit tired but yeah
<twilightboy> winter warpup!
<Lunarian> I did a few times yesterday, but I was watching with the fan on and windows open.
<twilightboy> wrapup*

<twilightboy> poor twilight
<Enterprize> >winter warpup
<Enterprize> s
<Enterprize> sounds good to me!
<Ascendant> I can't be bothered lol
<Ascendant> and I probably can't either
<Ghosties> 4DCD, can we get you in the mod chat?
<nickstr> you will have to
<nickstr> in order to get me to run Linux exclusively
<nickstr> until then I am happy with 64 bit Windows
<nickstr> and its over all superior hardware support
<mib_gl8c76> this is amaizing but I need to go to sleep because is 6 am in Poland and I spent all night before computer.
<twilightboy> UHN TIS
<SummerSong> 0Well, Im off too, thanks and see everypony later!

<SirSprinkles> 6I'm going to get kicked constantly for colors since I'm not on script yet, but I don't really care. XD
<GreySmoke> What if, for just a gag, somepony up high gave derpy her own episode for S2?
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL I can't be kicked because dari's only halfop

<Enterprize> I just had an idea for a picture!
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles, didn't you request that earlier?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<eXAKR> Install 32-bit Windows 7 on my VirtualBox, install it there, and then swipe the executable from there
<GreySmoke> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGSmdOlRokM
<SirSprinkles> 6I was also the one who requested the dinosaur ytp
<eXAKR> But now I can't find the app
<SirSprinkles> 6Argh. GreySmoke's video is buffering

<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah. But what else is new.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari and his crazy awesome text.
<Ghosties> 4And now all that's left, besides Enterprize, is the idles that probably forgot about the stream
<MtChar> Cool
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<SirSprinkles> 6Odd, somepony's on auto away after only 18 minutes.
<SirSprinkles> 6It usually waits an hour.

<SirSprinkles> 6I know dari is watching. Always watching.
<Ascendant> I prefer VMware over virtualbox
<SirSprinkles> 6Hello dachi
<dachi> Howdy, did I miss the movies?
<SirSprinkles> 6Unfortunately so.
<dachi> awe, my bad.
<eXAKR> But VMware = payware
<SirSprinkles> 6They started nearly six hours ago, for future reference as to when they start.
<drfsupercenter> 03VMWarez isn't
<drfsupercenter> 03as it's warez
<junh1024-XD> what about parallels?
<dachi> Good to know. Always on friday correct?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<eXAKR> ...
<Ghosties> 4Sorry dachi, but you can enter into the selection thread currently on /oat/ at ponychan and if you're selected you can then choose a movie or mlp fim episode...whichever you were picked for
<Ghosties> 4Oh, and yes, every Friday at 7 PM EST
<eXAKR> Ah!
<eXAKR> Found the app I was looking for
<dachi> Cool, thanks. I'll be sure not to miss the next one.
<eXAKR> Now let's see if the developers updated the installer in the meantime
<SirSprinkles> 6And make sure to watch the main thread once it gets put up so you know when everything is starting, in case you don't want to watch specific parts of the stream.
<Kosoveon> night all
<eXAKR> If not I'm going to plop in my 32-bit Windows 7 into VirtualBox and grab it from there
<dachi> Take care everypony. I'm going to finish my ATG submission for EQD
<dachi> Next time
<SirSprinkles> 6G'night!

<SirSprinkles> 6And now it's gone.
<SirSprinkles> 6Weird...
<Ghosties> 4It signifies when you've been away and there's been more talking
<MtChar> Seems like youre having trouble deciding whether to get some free penis or not
<Ghosties> 4At least in the chat anyways

<Ghosties> 4You deserve a sgon
<Ghosties> 4*song
<Ghosties> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5TXyJlEMc
<SirSprinkles> 6I freaking love this song.
<Ghosties> 4You're like my second in command, Sprinkles
<SirSprinkles> 6Mods are now pirates. XD
<Ghosties> 4Mah second mate
<Ghosties> 4Er
<Ghosties> 4first mate
<SirSprinkles> 6yep.jpg
<Ghosties> 4But yeah, pretty much. I thought it was awesome that you knew what I was talking about earlier today
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm just amazed I got the lyrics right.
<Ghosties> 4Did you know of Alestorm?
<SirSprinkles> 6I always want to say Diddle dee dee instead of Fiddle dee dee
<Glacymr> 12kk
<SirSprinkles> 6I had heard of them. Originally heard the song from that one kids show.
<Glacymr> 12!exakr
*eXAKR now belongs to Glacymr for 14 minutes
<SirSprinkles> 6Name currently escaping me.
<Ghosties> 4Lazy Town
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah. That.
<Ghosties> 4I only know because I looked up the original today
<SirSprinkles> 6Their video for it is entertaining.
<SirSprinkles> 6As well as being a frequent meme in the local area.
<Ghosties> 4I thought it was a pretty awesome song in general, even without Alestorm's touch
<Ghosties> 4Pirates are a general meme in your local area?
<SirSprinkles> 6The VIDEO is.
<SirSprinkles> 6Pirates are too, but in wider area.
<SirSprinkles> 6We legit have people that dress up as pirates or ninjas randomly.
<Ghosties> 4Lol nice
<SirSprinkles> 6I actually used to work at a Halloween store. Dressed up as a pirate every day for work. Was awesome.
<Ghosties> 4Sweet

<Ghosties> 4That's why I asked you to get internet as soon as possible because we get together fairly often

<Ghosties> 4And I don't know if Ponychan implemented a new word filter...why do you ask?
<eXAKR> that
<SirSprinkles> 6It looks like mfw is being wordfiltered, though I haven't tested
<Chimera> 04um
<Chimera> 04okay?
<drf|laptop> 03no, it's not okay
<SirSprinkles> 6The picture to the left depicts my reaction to these proceedings
*drf|laptop runs
<SirSprinkles> 6To that.
<Ghosties> 4Weird
<Chimera> 04liar.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
<drf|laptop> 03also that link you posted
<drf|laptop> 03didn't load
<drf|laptop> 03at al
<drf|laptop> 03*all
<drf|laptop> 03but that's probably fine
<Chimera> 04?
<drf|laptop> 03it didn't load,.
<Ghosties> 4Well, as I mentioned, I opted for you to be a full op but I guess everyone has to "pay their dues" I suppose
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm fine with it.
<Ghosties> 4And once more, it's just us
<Ghosties> 4In a chatroom
<Ghosties> 4with *dari*
<SirSprinkles> 6He's here... always here...
<SirSprinkles> 6CURSE YOUR AFK
<Ghosties> 4Indeed, he's quite the lurker
<eXAKR> One of my sister's friends on Facebook is saying she's listening to Justin Bieber right now
<eXAKR> ._.
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to find an mp3 for You Are A Pirate
<Chimera> 04eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<eXAKR> The only worse thing could be if she;s listening to Rebecca Black

<Ghosties> 4Yes you do
<Ghosties> 4If you have YouTube to MP3 Converter then that works perfectly
<SirSprinkles> 6I can get one easily, but not now... don't feel like looking for it.
<Chimera> 04eXAKR
*Chimera brofists
<Ghosties> 4Ah
*eXAKR brofists back
<eXAKR> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_(Rebecca_Black_song) <---
<eXAKR> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_(Rebecca_Black_song)#Critical_reception <- this part specifically
<Chimera> 04After reading the harsh reviews of "Friday", Black said that "those hurtful comments really shocked me." Ark Music offered to take the video down from YouTube, but Black refused the offer, saying that she did not wish "to give the haters the satisfaction that they got me so bad I gave up."[62] Black's father has accompanied her in public to guard against potential accosters.
<Chimera> 04lolwow
<Chimera> 04"Those hurtful comments really shocked me" Well people suck.
<SirSprinkles> 6;-; I want my applebloom trip...
<Chimera> 04And if they don't like something 90% of the mwill send death threats.
<Chimera> 04*them will
<Ghosties> 4How many tries so far, Sprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6 70 billion
<Ghosties> 4You are a brave man, Sprinkles
<SirSprinkles> 6I am determined to get this trip.
<SirSprinkles> 6I feel like kicking people...
<Ghosties> 4Eh, it's not my say. You are in control of your own destiny now
<SirSprinkles> 6lawls
<SirSprinkles> 6Just gonna kick mpd
<Ghosties> 4I think at the least you can kick Enterprize too. He's sleeping, after all
<Chimera> 04bbl
<Ghosties> 4There we go, you're becoming a regular pro at this!
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not hard.
<Ghosties> 4Look, I'm trying to be a mentor of sorts. If you keep devaluing my mentoring you're just gonna ruin the whole experience >_<
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6But it's so fun!
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles, you're like the punk protege
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm too hyper to be.
<Ghosties> 4I'd say wise cracking, but I'm a bit of a wise cracker myself
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles, you're like the Bat to my Kenshiro
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6What were the movies the first week? Wasn't it just Superman IV?
<Ghosties> 4I do believe so, yes
<Ghosties> 4It was just Superman IV but we had a pre-show and ponies after
<SirSprinkles> 6I thought so.
<SirSprinkles> 6I thought for a second I was just being spacy... Oo
<Ghosties> 4Spacy? Nonsense
<Ghosties> 4Unless I'm being spacy oo
<Ghosties> 4..nah
<SirSprinkles> 6I should probably get home and get to bed...
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, go sleep. You're a mod now and that means you have *in a deeply dramatic voice* RESPONSIBILITIES!
<SirSprinkles> 6FULL LIFE CONSEQUENCES
<SirSprinkles> 6So Monday?
<SirSprinkles> 6Though I'm sure I'll be on before then.
<Ghosties> 4Generally Monday, yeah. Keep an eye on the Mod Discussion thread on /chat/ however because that's when one of us will let others know what we're talking about or when we're meeting here
<SirSprinkles> 6Is it currently up? If so could you bump it so I can watch it?
<Ghosties> 4I'll check to see if it's up
<Ghosties> 4Here, it's not the "new" Mod Discussion thread but it should suffice for now
<Ghosties> 4http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/188267.html
<Ghosties> 4When you sign in as a "mod" for the thread (if you decide to post) make sure that you put a # and then your name next to it in the Subject box
<SirSprinkles> 6Got it, ty
<SirSprinkles> 6Heading off now.
<SirSprinkles> 6G'night.
<SirSprinkles> 6AND G'NIGHT TO YOU TOO DARI SINCE I KNOW YOU'RE LURKING!
<Ghosties> 4Goodnight Sprinkles, sleep tight. See you soon.
<SirSprinkles> 6You too. XD
<Ghosties> 4And now
<Ghosties> 4It's just lonesome old me
<Plasterduck> eeyup
<Ghosties> 4Woah, I'm not alone anymore
<Plasterduck> That would appear to be the case
<Ghosties> 4Indeed
<Ghosties> 4Welcome to the chatroom
<Plasterduck> mhmm
<Plasterduck> I'm usually in #mylitlepony
<Ghosties> 4Ah, didn't know about that channel. I may check it out some time

<Umbreon> 12oh
<Umbreon> 12so that's an HP gage?
<Armageddon> if you have less HP you usually lose
<Armageddon> yes
<Armageddon> 30/936 is my HP (30)
<Armageddon> 185/232 is yours
<Umbreon> 12what determines how much damage is done
<Revy> weaponry!

<Armageddon> and shields, boots, etc.

<Aurora> 6 124% in my health class
<Chimera> 04if you write a script to append text to ANY text box
<Chimera> 04if you make a text box with letters in it, only letters within that text box will be able to be appended.
<prince-dari> Lol wrong.
<prince-dari> You need to embed the font...
<Chimera> 04Which means you need to have a text box with all the keyboard characters- this means lowercase and capital letters
<prince-dari> :P
<Chimera> 04not wrong
<prince-dari> No, you're wrong.
<Chimera> 04because it just hap- what

<prince-dari> Oh wow, what you've got so far is really good. I like your animation, nice and smooth.
<Chimera> 04C:
<prince-dari> I've never been so good at the graphics side of things, I tend to be better with the script aspect.
<Chimera> 04let's team up
<Chimera> 04because I suck at scripting
<Chimera> 04and I want to make this interactive |D
<prince-dari> Well I'd be glad to help in any way I can.
<Chimera> 04I'll credit you for all the scripts, even the ones I did x3
<Chimera> 04YES
<Chimera> 04thanks
<Chimera> 04so let's take this to PM shall we?~
<prince-dari> Sure.
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o

<SirSprinkles> 6Hello Rotwang
<Stormy> Quack|2?
<Stormy> You around?
*Lambda slaps Quack|2 with a 4r8a9i11n13b17o26w trout
<Stormy> It's another one of these stupid troll accounts
<Stormy> http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4932.html
<Neon> I think LOLOwl from OFF is a troll account.
<Lambda> yeah that's gotta be a troll account
<Lambda> have they posted at all?
<Lambda> Neon: who's LOLOwl?
<Lambda> I don't think I've seen them at all
<Espeon> 06~
<Lambda> oh yeah I have seen their posts
<Lambda> interesting fact about LOLOwl I just noticed
<Lambda> May 31st: "I'm the one who's gonna die tomorrow."
<Lambda> June 1st: "I'm the one who will die today just from the mere fact that I'm afraid my boat will sink."
<Lambda> has not posted since June 1st
<Lambda> what is that supposed to mean?
<Lambda> trying to see if anyone notices his/her "death"?
<lightumbreon> Gnita all
<Lambda> not: I do not actually beleive he/her is dead, this was just something I just noticed
<Angel_Espeon> 13I saw a group of like 20 men cycling down the street completely naked earlier today
<Neon> Yeah, I noticed that also. Kind gave me the chills.
<Lambda> I took it as a joke
<Lambda> but if not, that's pretty creepy and sad
<Espeon> 06what
<prince-dari> Hm.
<Chimera> 04Espy~
<Chimera> 04also wtf
<Neon> He/she isn't really dead, I can tell.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I can only assume it was for charity or something, since other weird things were going on today too xD
<Chimera> 04Yesterday someone was outside mowing the lawn
<Chimera> 04in his underwear
<Chimera> 04|D
<Neon> Vying for attention like most of the members.
<Chimera> 04We saw it in our bus
<Lambda> yeah, that was what I thought too
<Chimera> 04He flipped us all off LOL
<Espeon> 06sounds weird
<Espeon> 06yet amusing
<Neon> It's funny. Sometimes I feel like the loneliest person alive, but I'd never do what some of these people do to make people notice them.
<Chimera> 04You would, Espeon
<Chimera> 04|D
*Glacymr slides Espeon onto his back
<Glacymr> 12!espeon
*Espeon still belongs to Global for 6 more minutes
<Lambda> most of them are pretty young though, aren't they?
<Lambda> a lot of what they do seems like childish ways of getting attention
<Neon> That's also true.
<Neon> Maybe I'm just too private of a person to understand.
<Lambda> trust me, I don't understand why they do it either, the just seem immature in their methods of attention seeking
<Espeon> 3[6!6espeon vars 4reset3]
<Espeon> 06nope
<Neon> They need some good ol' fashioned child abuse, is what they need.

<prince-dari> Nick: Eeyup.
<HyperMetalLugia> NO WE DO NOT
<Neon> Oh, I figured out why she might not have been on. She's probably vacationing on a boat, which would explain why she hasn't been on.
<HyperMetalLugia> THat was a negative response
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> which is what she meant by "My boat will sink"
<prince-dari> Trollestia would be proud.
<prince-dari> :P
<Lambda> I see
<Angel_Espeon> 13no

<SirSprinkles> 6He should know that Rarity is the best in the mane cast.
<prince-dari> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6And if Peanut was paying attention he'd agree!
<prince-dari> But he's not, so Rainbow Dash is best pony. >:)
<prince-dari> Or is Derpy best pony? :o
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope, if you venture outside the mane cast, and into bg ponies, it's Lyra.

<Bakphoon> I'm going to host the server
<Bakphoon> But, I'm busy farming hooks since I seem to get the dropped like crazy
<MajinMew> i only ever got two in 36+ hours of playtime
<MajinMew> The Hook is a component used to craft Grappling Hooks. It is dropped rarely by Skeletons and Dead miners
<MajinMew> You can "farm" them in the Cavern layer if you build an area with platforms that lead straight to you. A Water Candle will make the Skeletons spawn more often, which can help. Skeletons have a 1:300 chance of dropping a hook.

<NightSeas> 12Don't know if it would be considered primary, but here's the link: http://greatlugia.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d35dn5j
<Quanyails> 7Okay. o3o
<Steve> 12 Hello, Quack|2 and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<NightSeas> 12It’s signature look is the red streaks on it, giving it it’s name.
<NightSeas> 12Also, line art in picture not made by me XD
<Steve> 12 Hello, Quack|2 and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Damos> I want to make a line art
<Freyskol> Vaporeon.
<Freyskol> Or Garchomp./
<Quanyails> 7Or?
*Quanyails 7needs primary ones. o3o
<Freyskol> Well, I go by two different names.
<Freyskol> So I technically have two primarys :P
<Quanyails> 7Well, that won't work. :/
<Freyskol> Aww :p
<Damos> wait whats a pokesona?
<Quanyails> 7A persona that's a pokemon. :P
<Damos> persona?
<Damos> person?
<NightSeas> 12XD
<NightSeas> 12A persona (not a typo) is a make believe character that is suppose to represent someone, should I say.
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 2weird
<Damos> oh
<Damos> you mean like a hybrid?
<Freyskol> I guess Garchomp would be more likely.
<Quanyails> 7Nope.avi @ Damos.
<Quanyails> 7Like an avatar. :P
<Quanyails> 7If you get that. o.O
<Damos> ohhhhhhhhhhh
<Quanyails> 7Garchomp; got it.
<Quanyails> 7Not in the icon sense. :P
<Quanyails> 7The 'representative' sense.
<Damos> can I have a pic?
<Damos> can you* show* me a pic
<Damos> thats better
<Damos> XD
<Quanyails> 7http://quanyails.deviantart.com/art/Quanyails-Character-Sheet-158554050 <-- you mean, like my character sheet?
<Damos> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<NightSeas> 12I’ll give you a example Damos. Arti’s persona would be a Articuno.
<Damos> oh
<Damos> okay
<Damos> sory
<Damos> sorry*
<Damos> hmmm I'm still having trouble of what mine would be
<NightSeas> 12No need to say sorry XD. I used to have no idea what one was either.
<Damos> XD
<Eevee> k
<NightSeas> 12Hmm, why you asking for pokesonas Quanyails?
<Quanyails> 7It all started in 2009 when I got a Dratini in-game. :P
<Quanyails> 7For some reason, I decided to name that Dratini after Kyu. :P
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Quanyails> 7Then I got the Dream World Espeon.
<Quanyails> 7Then I got the Dream World Vulpix --> Ninetales.
<Quanyails> 7You can see where this is going?
<NightSeas> 12Yes XD

<Ascendant> because that's what mum's do

<Ascendant> don't worry
<Ascendant> I hate my mum too :D
<Chimera> She just kicked me off
<Chimera> And locked the door
<Chimera> Even though I'm not doing f***ing anything tomorrow
<Chimera> And I got a compiler error in Flash.
<Chimera> But does she let me fix it? No. She forces me out of the room and tells me to turn my computer off.
<Chimera> >_>
<Chimera> Honestly what does it matter to her if I sleep late or not? It doesn't affect her *at all*
<eXAKR> For what? D:

<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Chimera> Only when she wants me to do something and I say no.
<eXAKR> Both of you need to understand each other more
<Chimera> She doesn't even let me have a choice; it's only "I'm the parent and you do what I say."
<Chimera> Am I the only one who gets MAJORLY P!SSED OFF from that?
<eXAKR> Yeah, a dictator parent >>
<eXAKR> Somewhat like my mum as well
<Chimera> Both of them are.
<Chimera> Drives me INSANE.
<eXAKR> families with parents like that are never healthy
<Chimera> What really drives me up the wall is that almost all the time, she doesn't tell me why I should do something.
<Chimera> It's just "because I said so."
<Chimera> And no my family is not at all healthy.
<Aurora> 6I don't really understand dictatorship parents
<Aurora> 6cuz I'm compliant with whatever my parents say
<Aurora> 6I never talk back
<Chimera> I pretty much despise my sister
<Chimera> Cya Roara :/
<Chimera> But still
<Chimera> My dad acts like a jerk and my mom wants her way all the time.
<Kryo> fail?
<eXAKR> Seems like my parents
<Quilava> hi
<Kryo> hi
<Kryo> why fail NS?
<Chimera> And she's a hypocryte, according to my reacent understandings.
<Kryo> u talking about my name? if u are, i know i typed it that way :P
<eXAKR> I think they need to understand that, while they ultimately have our best interests at heart sometimes, we have free will ourselves too
<eXAKR> let us make a few mistakes, else we never learn
<Chimera> She agreed to her friend Nancy about how kids shouldn't respect their parents because they're parents.
<Chimera> You earn your respect no matter who you are.
<eXAKR> Indeed
<Chimera> But you know what she says when I fight back?
<Chimera> "RESPECT ME."
<Chimera> F*** no.
<eXAKR> A bit like my mum
<eXAKR> She's a bit of hypocrite at times
<Armageddon> XD
<Chimera> Oh and this is rich
<Chimera> When I got home one day she locked the door apparently
<Chimera> To the playroom
<eXAKR> >>
<Chimera> I was able to push it open
<eXAKR> And then?
<Kryo> http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/253742_206181236090619_100000962322868_563446_6343164_n.jpg
<Kryo> XD
<Kryo> i lol'd so hard at this
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm glad my boyfriend's mom is cool
<Chimera> But then when she gets home she goes "WHY did you pick the lock?! I locked it for a reason! >_>"
<Roara|Touhou> 6I've had enough of lunatic parets
<Chimera> I didn't pick the lock
<Roara|Touhou> 6for one life
<eXAKR> My dad's usually the lunatic when I was young
<eXAKR> He was... violent
<Chimera> I tell her that the door could have just been pushed open
<Chimera> She says "BS."
<Chimera> I RECORD me pushing open a locked door
<eXAKR> My mum, less so, but when she gets mad she's violent as well
<Chimera> She watches the video and goes "Oh SHUT up!"
<eXAKR> ...
<Chimera> So yeah I'm done with my family.
<eXAKR> My parents are seperated
<eXAKR> So now I only have to deal with my dad on a daily basis
<Chimera> I wish I was seperated from my parents.
<Chimera> Two more years...
<eXAKR> He's not violent now, but he has... hygiene issues.
<Chimera> Too more freaking years...
<Chimera> Ew
<eXAKR> Yeah
<eXAKR> I have learnt to deal with it mostly
<eXAKR> I just retreat to my room and set it up as a complete living space for myself
<eXAKR> And keep it clean
<eXAKR> and ban him from coming in
<eXAKR> It's really bad when you are a clean freak like me
<Chimera> Lulz
<Chimera> But ugh
<Chimera> I really WANT my mom to not be so psychotic
<Chimera> Like
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol boyfriends
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol parentds
<HyperMetalLugia> *parents
<Chimera> I don't really just want to leave the house knowing I left behind my family being insane
<Armageddon> ohai Zephyr
<Chimera> I want to leave with something GOOD to look back at
<Zephyr> Hiya!
<Chimera> Even if it was just one or two good years.
<Chimera> But nothing can be simple. -_-
<HyperMetalLugia> I go against everything my parents say that I don't agree with ;p
<eXAKR> Life's like that
<eXAKR> sigh
<HyperMetalLugia> if it doesn't fix something, then i'm not going to let it happen
<Armageddon> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Or at least happen their way .v.

<UxieLover1994> I'm able to destry all the Dark Gems in Lost Cities without needing the 24 Light Gems. I know a way to get through the Sunken Ruins without going into the toxic lakes.
<DSD|Sleep> Man one more light gem and one more dakr gem and i'm done with listing everything here

<DSD|Sleep> is how come there all these eggs?
<DSD|Sleep> What happen to the Year of the dragon?
<UxieLover1994> I've already beaten the Sorceress
<UxieLover1994> About the eggs, I'm unsure
<UxieLover1994> Maybe they are going to be idle for the next ten years?
<UxieLover1994> AHT takes place two years after YotD
*Ascendant glares at Ray
<DSD|Sleep> Maybe
<DSD|Sleep> Also whats funny is Ember is in more games then Flame
<DSD|Sleep> Yet tehy both only come in once

<UxieLover1994> So, you've already met up with Flame, eh?
<DSD|Sleep> Naw i can't get the Dark gem near SGT Byrd

<prince-dari> User submitted information.
<Cynder7> 6What do you mean?
*SilverSonic awakens finally x_________________________x
<prince-dari> It probably wasn't very good out.
<prince-dari> Then when it guessed wrong people would type what they were thinking of.
<prince-dari> Possibly adding questions it could ask to determine what you are thinking of.
<prince-dari> So now it's pretty good.
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Icydragon> Ah yesssss
<prince-dari> Ponies?
<Icydragon> Ponies aren't sexy so no

<prince-dari> I wouldn't start with either of the first two episodes if you're serious about watching any of them.
<Icydragon> 12Eh too late....
<prince-dari> Never mind, it's just they give a bad impression of what the rest of the episodes are like.
<Icydragon> 12What is this?It's just.... cute.... I'd rater watch lulzy cats
<Cynder7> 6Wha?
<prince-dari> You should watch dragonshy, that's a pretty funny episodes.

<prince-dari> LOL, I'm sure that still happens in some places.
<Icydragon> 12And why are Spyro fans so messed up?You guys are starting to act like sonicfags
<UxieLover1994> 13Isn't this ment to be an IRC for the Spyro series?
<Icydragon> 12Pfft rarely
<prince-dari> No more messed up than it's always been here.
<prince-dari> Unless you've forgotten about our 'marriage'. :P
<UxieLover1994> 13Well, maybe we should talk about Spyro-related stuff! ;)
<Icydragon> 12Shut up, I was experimenting
<prince-dari> Hahahahaha,
<prince-dari> Sure, whatever.
<UxieLover1994> 13Er?

<Icydragon> 12Well... kinda still am, I prefer girls
<prince-dari> Right.
<UxieLover1994> 13Girls? You mean the normal ones or the gross ones?
<UxieLover1994> 13We women have feelings too, y'know!
<Icydragon> 12Wha?I didn't say girls in a disrepsectful way... if you were offended
<UxieLover1994> 13Oh, sorry
*Cynder7 6lols at the sight of a pic.
<UxieLover1994> 13Anyway, I'm just going back on my game for a moment, before any of you gross me out of the Pride Lands

<prince-dari> I won't say anything else since it'd be hypocritical when I don't think you should bash MLP before having tried it.

<Icydragon> 12prince-dari: I have, but I just can't stand it or anything else on hub, I only like transformers prime.
<Icydragon> 12Well it may not be on hub in the uk idk
<prince-dari> Like I said, first two episodes aren't a good judgement of the whole thing.
<prince-dari> We don't have the Hub in the UK.
<prince-dari> But ponies are coming to CN sometime.
<lightlugia> ohai
<prince-dari> This video is still epic.
<Icydragon> 12Fine fine I'll give it a chance, idk maybe I'm judging it cuz it's a girly thing
<prince-dari> As I said maybe you should watch Dragonshy or something, if you don't like it, fair enough.
<Damos> hey nicky
<Icydragon> 12Ok, I don't like ruining stuff for other people by just hating it

*drf|laptop is kinda pissed
<drf|laptop> 03I think I broke a brand new $250 motherboard
<lightlugia> ouch
<lightlugia> wich brand?
<Damos> oe
<drf|laptop> 03Gigabyte
<lightlugia> ....
<lightlugia> let it be
<drf|laptop> 03it's like THE most hardcore motherboard for LGA1156 ever
<drf|laptop> 03...LOL what
<drf|laptop> 03you don't like them?
<lightlugia> ....what?
<drf|laptop> 03I like MSI myself, but unfortunately MSI doesn't make a board that good
<drf|laptop> 03dude
<drf|laptop> 03it has 10 SATA ports
<drf|laptop> 033 PCIe x16t
<drf|laptop> 03-t
<drf|laptop> 03it's awesome
<lightlugia> ok...
<drf|laptop> 03and the hting is, LGA1156 is kinda dated now
<lightlugia> i still go for Asus
<drf|laptop> 03so it's hard to find them
<lightlugia> :3
<Damos> just be glad it wan't an apple product
<drf|laptop> 03I have no problem with Asus
<lightlugia> agreed
<drf|laptop> 03Damos, if it was, I would break it intentionally
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Damos> I agree
<lightlugia> Asus is my personal Favourite brand for Motherboards
<UxieLover1994> 13Scar defeated!
<drf|laptop> 03MSI is my favorite
<lightlugia> i figured
<drf|laptop> 03but Gigabyte isn't bad, I've used one of their boards and it works fine
<drf|laptop> 03why
<lightlugia> heh
<drf|laptop> 3Mainboard Vendor: MSI
<drf|laptop> 03;P
<lightlugia> you said it yourself
<Icydragon> 12I enjoy fighting scar.... but the Mysterious figure was just amazing to beat
<lightlugia> ever heard of Medion?
<UxieLover1994> 13I'll say!
<drf|laptop> 03only from you
<lightlugia> it's a dutch brand
<lightlugia> but they're fine
<UxieLover1994> 13Twilight Town's next! I cannot wait to visit Space Paranoids!
<Icydragon> 12How did I do it the first time?!?!
<drf|laptop> 03and man, this laptop cooler works pretty well
<drf|laptop> 03LL and I might be able to have kids someday now :D
*drf|laptop runs
<lightlugia> but the motherboard ventilators go like...4 years, then they're dead
<UxieLover1994> 13Huh?
<drf|laptop> 03but nah, that whole "using laptops on your lap is bad" thing is kinda bogus if you ask me
<Icydragon> 12Beat MF
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<lightlugia> ...
<lightlugia> right...
<drf|laptop> 03the heat on mine comes out the back
<drf|laptop> 03which is my leg
<drf|laptop> 03not that part
<lightlugia> ...
<drf|laptop> 03maybe if your laptop has fans in the front
<drf|laptop> 03it might make senes
<drf|laptop> 03but eh
<drf|laptop> 03*sense
<UxieLover1994> 13Try to remember!
<lightlugia> mine fans on the bottom
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm happy, 'cause the next Party Member is Tron!
<lightlugia> and the back
<Icydragon> 12I got his health bar half way down then I got lucky
<Icydragon> 12I love how this guide I read said it's just luck beating him
<drf|laptop> 03mine is just the back right
<drf|laptop> 03no fans on the bottom
<drf|laptop> 03I've also read reports saying that it's sitting in that position with your legs together that's what's bad
<drf|laptop> 03in which case all the coolers in the world won't help you
<lightlugia> heh

<prince-dari> Nothing. 0Just when you get close, and you think it's safe, that's when he strikes!

<Cynder7> 6I'm pretty sure I read something like that somewhere..
<DSD> 4Also Dark Spyro is said to be in it
<UxieLover1994> 13It said you get three
<DSD> 4I heard somewhere they where going to be like 10$ us a pop
<prince-dari> 1....0.....2...3....4....5...6...7...
<Cynder7> 6And you get the little models of them and they can be used to save your game or something and then connect it so some other console and be able to load your game..
<UxieLover1994> 13I just hope Stealth Elf is not the only female...
<Icydragon> 12What if I wet mine when I take a bath with it?
<Cynder7> 6I don't even know who Stealth Elf is.. :P
<DSD> 4Icy ....
<UxieLover1994> 13She's the ninja from the tralier
<prince-dari> I don't get why you'd want extra characters that are essentially irrelevent to gameplay, if they're free maybe, but to pay for them?
<Cynder7> 6Then you can hold a funeral for it.
<DSD> 4Dari it's like DLC
<Cynder7> 6Indeed..
<Cynder7> 6DLC?
<prince-dari> DLC usually adds something to gameplay.
<DSD> 4I figure they might be 2 to 4 $ a pop
<prince-dari> Not always, but the worthwhile ones do.
<DSD> 4Dari new characters new gameplay
<Icydragon> 12DSD: So it's like a scam to waste your money
<prince-dari> Add new areas, new things to do. Not just a new character for the sake of a new character.
<Cynder7> 6Shame the site doesn't have much to see..
<Cynder7> 6:O
<UxieLover1994> 13I just hope it will be good...
<DSD> 4Maybe
<DSD> 4I think it will

<DSD> 4But i'm a true spyro fan
<UxieLover1994> 13I am too!
<Cynder7> 6Same.
<prince-dari> Hahaha, look at all the dislikes on that video.
<Cynder7> 6I do like how they used Thunderstruck.. :3
<prince-dari> Looks like the game has some critics. :P
<UxieLover1994> 13Yeah, I'm angry with them!
<Cynder7> 6:P
<UxieLover1994> 13With the haters, of course
<DSD> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePT8PtPzRaM&feature=channel_video_title Uxie
<prince-dari> Cynder7: Good music, I'm not sure about the game though. :P
<DSD> 4This is the vid that pawns
<Cynder7> 6Aaah,I saw the Stealth Elf.. :P
<Cynder7> 6Yep.. :P
<Icydragon> 12I like to refresh rebecca blacks video and watch the dislikes go up
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<UxieLover1994> 13Aura's already shown me it.
<Cynder7> 6Is it me or does Spyro sound like Bugs Bunny in the first few seconds? o.o
<DSD> 4He does
<prince-dari> But I actually like Bugs Bunny.
<Icydragon> 12Rings!?RINGS!?
<UxieLover1994> 13At least he's no longer voiced by Tom Kenny
<prince-dari> What were you saying about sonicfags? LO
<prince-dari> :P*
<Cynder7> 6What's wrong with Tom Kenny? D:
<Icydragon> 12I hate them with a passion
<DSD> 4Maybe now he'll be a real dragon with no english
<DSD> 4Uxie you a hater
<Icydragon> 12I liked Tom Kenny as Skids and Wheelie
<prince-dari> I'd give this game a chance, but I really don't like the look of this game.
<Cynder7> 6I basically like him and Elijah most as Spyro voices..
<UxieLover1994> 13I never said I hate him...

<prince-dari> The original Spyro games were so popular, I don't see why they felt the need to completely change everything.
<Quanyails> 7Why are they all even? o3o
<Icydragon> 12I think tom Kenny did spyro best
<prince-dari> Luck.

<HyperMetalLugia> See
<Quanyails> 7Yay!
<UxieLover1994> 13Yes, he did!
<DSD> 4Dari after the thrid game then what?
<DSD> 4It's not like they could have kept going
<DSD> 4It would have gone ot the ps2 sooner or latter
<Icydragon> 12I'm I the only one who find a hero's tail extreamly boring?
<DSD> 4then GC xbox GBA
<DSD> 4Yes Icy
<prince-dari> Spyro 1 and 2 were the best.
<DSD> 4It's just you
<prince-dari> I would've like more like them.
<Cynder7> 6Yeah but they could've continued with something similar to the trilogy for PS2 and then on..
<Icydragon> 12prince-dari: agreed
<UxieLover1994> 13Insomiac games sold the seires so they can do the Ratchet & Clank seires
<DSD> 4Dari yes but i think the new one might also be
<DSD> 4Consoles move on
<UxieLover1994> 13Right
<DSD> 4We can't have the ps for ever
<Cynder7> 6I hate it when they get rid of all the original characters..
<prince-dari> What is it FF14 or something now? Never played that series of games but they still seem to be going pretty strong.
<DSD> 4Yea that
<DSD> 4Yes
<DSD> 4But they don't stick with the same person
<Icydragon> 12Anyone here know if the playstation store is up?
<DSD> 4I think it is
<prince-dari> So? I bet they don't reboot the game and make it completely different every couple of games.
<Icydragon> 12I'm too lazy to go get my ps3 right now
<UxieLover1994> 13I'd check, but my PSP does not have interent
<UxieLover1994> 13I mean internet
<DSD> 4I'd check but mine died
<prince-dari> Meh, who cares about PSN when you've got homebrew.
<DSD> 4Yea did you hear about the new 3DS?
<UxieLover1994> 13Yes, I did
<Icydragon> 12I really don't but I'd like to download ad hoc party so i can play online with da pap
<DSD> 4No getting games
<Cynder7> 6Wow..I see everyone's PS-objects are in great shape.. o.o
<DSD> 4Mine is
<DSD> 4A dead shape
<prince-dari> Mine's fine.
<UxieLover1994> 13I've only got three PSP games
<Icydragon> 12once I get a 3ds that's it, i don't care about nintendo 3dsi xl now with a coffee maker
<Cynder7> 6Whatever.. :P
<Cynder7> 6"I want my RPL back please,pl0x,whatever.."
<DSD> 4So if Spyro could be redone like any of it's gmaes which one would you like it as?
<UxieLover1994> 13Great. The Gullwings!
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<prince-dari> Spyro 1 or 2.
<Cynder7> 6Any of the first three..
<UxieLover1994> 13Cutscene
<Cynder7> 6:P
<Icydragon> 12The Gullwings are hot, and so is Roxas
<UxieLover1994> 13lol Rikku!

<UxieLover1994> 13Almost there!
<DSD> 4Who would you want in it from any game if they could be in it?
<Icydragon> 12what?
<UxieLover1994> 13Bentley! I can imagin him boxing a yeti in front of Sora!
<Cynder7> 6Not sure about who exactly but probably original characters..
<UxieLover1994> 13Bentley is playable in the third game.
<UxieLover1994> 13lol Experiment 626!
<Icydragon> 12Stitch?
<Cynder7> 6Sheila was quite fun.. :P
<UxieLover1994> 13Yes, Stitch!
<DSD> 4Yea
<UxieLover1994> 13Sheila would be a good character as well!
<DSD> 4Although i would like Cynder in a game like that
<UxieLover1994> 13Wow! Tifa!
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm unsure about Cynder

<Aeroslash> I live in northern Minnesota, so that explains why

<prince-dari> I probably won't be able to make the next few movie nights as I have exams pretty much non-stop for the next couple of weeks, and I'll be on holiday for a week after that.
<prince-dari> I can probably leave the computer on though.
<prince-dari> I'll add something to the script so mods can be added and removed and it can be turned on/off.

<Quanyails> 7Hey, Nick.
<Nick> hi Quan
<SirSprinkles> 6At this point, if he parasprites again, I'm going to report him, otherwise, he's being ignored.

<ScriptBot> Aeroslash, you are a 4Stunky.
<Aeroslash> o.o
<Aeroslash> I'm not a smelly purple skunk....
<Ghosties> 4I think we should make him a mod. I mean shit, he's more avid in the BMN more than any other brony out there. Maybe it would make him more complacent
*Aeroslash sad faces
<Emmi> zomg
<Emmi> noez
<SirSprinkles> 6And have constant arguments within the mods?
<Emmi> kitten :((
<Ghosties> 4*sigh* You're right...
<Nick> god I'm nearly finished
<Nick> but dang I'm sick of doing this college work now
<HyperMetalLugia> Burn i
<HyperMetalLugia> t
<SirSprinkles> 6But I must say, you know you're doing something right when you start getting haters. Just means we're getting somewhere.
<Ghosties> 4I'm conflicted. I mean, I appreciate that Turni is standing up for difference of opinion and all that but we have a set structure AND it's not biased. Anybody can pick whatever the fuck they want, so he shouldn't be so damn bitchy about it every week
<Nick> no I need that to earn a degree D:
<SirSprinkles> 6Exactly. Like I told him. I have no issue if he's trying to be constructive, but at this point he's just bitching about it every week.
*Angel_Espeon goes on DW
<Angel_Espeon> 13I haven't been on this in ages
<Ghosties> 4To be fair, I do feel like Darken may have been influenced by the rest of us though.
<Angel_Espeon> 13and wow, after I got 1 dream pal I've suddenly had a lot of visitors
<ScriptBot> New Peak for #SilverWings is set on
<SirSprinkles> 6We should put some rules down on that to make sure people don't crazy post every time somepony gets picked.
<Ray> 02o-o
<Ghosties> 4I don't think we should go that far. Though, I humorously suggested that we slap a "EVERYBODY HAS DIFFERENT TASTES" text on the rules
<prince-dari> Lol, suddenly ferris wheels everywhere.
<Ghosties> 4Still, I'm gonna stop influencing people to pick something. I feel kinda like shit for pushing Darken to pick something else
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo Dari
<Ghosties> 4The chatroom notices us
<prince-dari> Hey. :P
<SilverSonic> o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<SirSprinkles> 6I didn't really try to influence anypony, though I did jokingly suggest SWHS for the bad movie, knowing it would never be picked anyway.
<Ghosties> 4Even if we were just joking, there were a few people (myself included) that said we didn't want to see what Darken was originally going to pick. That in itself is pretty biased
<SirSprinkles> 6I honestly think we should make it so that once the person who's name is called shows up, no suggestions. After they pick, sure, but not while they're thinking.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, that may work. I have no qualms about that
<SirSprinkles> 6But getting everypony to stop may be difficult the first few times around.
<Ghosties> 4I just don't want any inconsistencies with what the mods have laid down or in what we've said
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, but to be fair, it would just make it more consistent, since we already have the rule about posting your movie in your entry post.
<Ghosties> 4That's true. And see, that would clear up ANY lingering doubt over what you'd pick. You put what you want to see in your post. If your name is chosen, then we show it. End of story
<Ghosties> 4In fact
<Ghosties> 4Why DON'T we just switch over to that?
<Ghosties> 4That way, if the guy isn't there to respond it wouldn't matter because he's already made his choice
<SirSprinkles> 6Because it could make us seem biased during picking.
<prince-dari> Why?
<SirSprinkles> 6As well as there being multiples showing up so some movies would have larger chances from the getgo.
<Ghosties> 4Bleh, there's no catchall fix here
<SirSprinkles> 6No system is perfect.
<prince-dari> If you have a choice in mind when you first post then whether you say what it is you want to see then or later it makes no difference?
<prince-dari> Most poeple seem to know what they want already as they often say so in their post anyway.
<SirSprinkles> 6But they shouldn't be in the first place.
<prince-dari> What difference does it make?
<SirSprinkles> 6But my mane problem with it is it may make the picking seem biased, causing more of an uproar.
<SirSprinkles> 6It makes little difference, I just don't want the bias argument later on.
<SirSprinkles> 6It would be a heck of a lot harder to disprove than this, so... yeah.
<prince-dari> What is the bias arguement?
<SirSprinkles> 6If every picked movie is known, even though we're using a RNG or whatever, people will start to assume that we are simply picking whatever movie in the list we most want to see.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<prince-dari> Stream the random pick live. :P
<Ghosties> 4We'd have no way to disprove it
<SirSprinkles> 6...dari I love you.
<Ghosties> 4I don't know if DCD would be down for that
<SirSprinkles> 6True...

<prince-dari> Hmm...I'll just try some different things out then.
<prince-dari> The rainbow text rapes your eyes. :P
<Silverscreen> 11Rainbow text is cool text.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey Hipster
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yo
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster.
<Ghosties> 4Hello Hip
<Ghosties> 4ster
<Silverscreen> 11Hello, Hipster.
*Silverscreen 11pokes Hipster with a stick.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, how do you do that?
*prince-dari says "What, this?"
*SirSprinkles 6pokes Hipster
<SirSprinkles> 6Just "/me"
<Hipster_Brony> 8where it's like 3rd person
<bbl> 03difiigfin
*Hipster_Brony 8testing
<Hipster_Brony> 8me gusta
<Ghosties> 4*claps* good job
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Silverscreen> 11oh hey, I understood that spanish word.
<Ghosties> 4Since I honestly don't think we're gonna get anyone else in the chat, let's just go ahead and get started
<Silverscreen> 11So, what is it that we gotta talk about?
<Hipster_Brony> 8my roommate is a spanish major, so i know a bunch of basic spanish
<Silverscreen> 11I failed spanish in high school.
<Ghosties> 4We need to discuss the movies. Talk about how they are being picked
<prince-dari> I was going to take Spanish - ended up doing Economics instead.
<prince-dari> Fun, fun fun.
<Hipster_Brony> 8what about them, ghosties?
<Silverscreen> 11Oh yeah.
<Ghosties> 4Since Turni has brought it to our attention -so-many-times-, I think it would be a good idea to discuss how movies get picked
<Silverscreen> 11I honestly have no problem with how we've been doing it. Just because one person doesn't agree with it doesn't mean we need to change. Don't fix what's not broken.
<Silverscreen> 11So far, all the movies we watched fit the peramiters of the (albiet lenient) guidlines we set.
<Hipster_Brony> 8my reaction to it: http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b197/FinalValkyrie/Pinkie_Pie_haters_gonna_hate.gif
<SirSprinkles> 6I honestly just feel that the people who are chosen, once they're chosen, are instantly pressured by everypony else in the thread.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes, sprinkles, i agree with that
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles and I talked about that earlier
<Hipster_Brony> 8i will put something in the OP about that next week
<Silverscreen> 11Indeed. I noticed it. But that had no impact on my selection. B)
<prince-dari> If you put your movie choice beforehand it removes that, surely?
<Ghosties> 4Once someone is picked and said they are there, no one should be allowed to post or, at the very least, not try to influence
<Hipster_Brony> 8the problem with that is when we get duplicates
*SilverSonic flails about
<prince-dari> I don't see why that matters.
<junh1024-XD> Magikarp much/
<Silverscreen> 11Prince-Dari: But then it can seem like we're being biased when we choose the movie selection.
<Ghosties> 4The other problem with that is that people may think the mods are just choosing whatever they want from whatever was put in the posts
*Aeroslash blinks
<prince-dari> I thought people thought it was biased anyway?
<Silverscreen> 11choose the person posting, I mean.
<Ghosties> 4Only Turni REALLY thinks it's biased
<Silverscreen> 11I never heard of that. We've only had a mod choose the movie twice so far, and that was just the past two weeks.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if people honestly start thinking it's biased, i will screencap the results and post them
<SirSprinkles> 6I think we should put the selection thread up a day early, and then stream the selection live on Friday after the movies. No way for anyone to say it's biased.
<Hipster_Brony> 8hmmm
<Ghosties> 4We'd have to talk to DCD about it
<Ghosties> 4He's the streamer, after all
<Silverscreen> 11The streaming thing sounds good, but I don't think we should put the selection up a day early.
<Hipster_Brony> 8although honestly, I think we're spending too much time addressing the criticisms of one guy who is clearly just upset that he never gets picked
<SirSprinkles> 6Agreed, Hipster.
<Ghosties> 4Hold on, I think he has some validity in what Turni's saying though
<Silverscreen> 11Now that I think about it, the streaming idea could ensure that the people ARE there when their name gets called.
<Ghosties> 4He being turni
<SirSprinkles> 6But while we're on it we may as well figure out the best course of action for the future.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like the idea of doing the selection during movie night
<Ghosties> 4Turni just wants to see different films get picked and I am thankful that he is standing up for difference of opinion. However, I absolutely agree that he's just being bitch about everything mostly
<Hipster_Brony> 8it would also give people an incentive to stick around for the whole thing
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly we could eliminate the thread entirely.
<prince-dari> Also that way you could have people say movies beforehand. No way they can call bias, and that eliminates what you were talking about with people feeling pressured.
<SirSprinkles> 6We could use the sidelist during the movie night.
<Ghosties> 4But what if the selection thread divides interest?
<Hipster_Brony> 8I'm trying to think of logistics of how to do it
<SirSprinkles> 6How to do what?
<Silverscreen> 11Logistics.
<SilverSonic> XD
<Ghosties> 4If we have the selection thread air during the film, that'd be even more chance for people to influence what others want to see.
<Hipster_Brony> 8doing the selection during movie night
<SirSprinkles> 6Not really Ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> 6We could set it to mute, and give the chosen person voice.
<Ghosties> 4...
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Ghosties> 4Wait
<Hipster_Brony> 8we could put it up before movie night, tell people during pre-show announcements that its up
<prince-dari> Or you could let them give a movie choice when they submit their entrance to the 'raffle'.
<Ghosties> 4How would the person get to vote without being completely washed away in a storm of posts?
<Hipster_Brony> 8and do the drawing after
<Hipster_Brony> 8mute the channel
<SirSprinkles> 6Mute the chat, give the person voice.
<Armageddon> o_O
<Ghosties> 4Can we do that, Sprinkles?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<Ghosties> 4Oh, well
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, we can, Ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> 6One moment, will demonstrate.
<Ghosties> 4There's the solution for that I guess.
<conjure> hello
<SirSprinkles> 6Hello conjure
<conjure> hi
<prince-dari> I thought the problem with saying what movie you want with your submission was that people would say we chose the movie and it was biased? If we streamed it live, then surely it would make no difference if people say what movie they want with their submission?
<SirSprinkles> 6True, dari.
<prince-dari> You can't be pressured into a choice you've already made.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it's just another thing I would rather not deal with, dari
<Hipster_Brony> 8people asking if this or that movie is acceptable
<Hipster_Brony> 8incomplete entries
<Hipster_Brony> 8it would make it so much more work on my end
<SirSprinkles> 6Who knows how to give voice?
<SirSprinkles> 6So I can demonstrate.
<Ghosties> 4Oh yeah, and, if the person comes up with a film that isn't appropriate we'd have to stream it at a later date and then try to find the guy and ask him for a different film
<Hipster_Brony> 8whereas right now i just log the names into a word file and paste them into a list randomizer
<prince-dari> Need an op to do it though.
<SirSprinkles> 6Somepony give the other me voice
<Silverscreen> 11I can't read the whole name.
<Silverscreen> 11there we go.
<SprinklesTheSecond> Tada
<Silverscreen> 11and chanserve help saves the day...for me.
<SirSprinkles> 6And there you have it.
<Ghosties> 4Wait, what?
<Chimera> 04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHkiyuqsfIc <-- This is epic.
<SirSprinkles> 6The channel is muted.
<Ghosties> 4Ohhhhhh
<Ghosties> 4I see
<SirSprinkles> 6But we gave voice to somepony.
<Ghosties> 4Alright, well, at least that problem is solved
<Silverscreen> 11And voice is gone.
<SirSprinkles> 6Once they select, we remove voice, and go on.
<Aeroslash> :O
<Silverscreen> 11When on mute, only Voiced people and Mods can speak.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, another thing to talk about
<Ghosties> 4But, I still think that we may divide interest if we have the selection thread going at the same time the stream is airing. Oh well, I guess that's a risk we'll just have to take
<Hipster_Brony> 8I want to set up a listserv for BMN
<Aeroslash> indeed, this is epic
<prince-dari> You can't set up services on a network you aren't running.
<Silverscreen> 11?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties, it only takes like 5 seconds to enter the selection thread
<DarthVader> O_o
<Hipster_Brony> 8but anyway
<SirSprinkles> 6And most people will likely do it during the preshow.
<Hipster_Brony> 8how do we do a listserv?
<jasperdett> humm
<Silverscreen> 11What's a listserv?
<Hipster_Brony> 8does anypony know?
<SirSprinkles> 6Uh... dari?
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver, it lets us mass email the people who opt into it
<Armageddon> o-o
<Silverscreen> 11oh,like with The Daily /oat/
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<luna> 09,01O00,01-o
<Silverscreen> 11....I haven't a clue.
<Ghosties> 4What is the purpose of the listserv?
<Hipster_Brony> 8it would make it so that people wouldnt have to rely on seeing the ponychan thread every week to know what movies and such
<Hipster_Brony> 8basically, it would give us a reliable way of disseminating information to people who want to come
<Ghosties> 4Ohhhh, so we could just send emails out to people that have entered into the selection threads
<SilverSonic> ohai you 2
<Silverscreen> 11Yep. It'll be really useful for regulars, especially when the threads get swamped by /oat/ and /chat/ nonsense.
<Ascendant> lolwut
<Ghosties> 4Very nice. As you said, it'll filter out all the bs
<SirSprinkles> 6Why does shutterfly still have voice?
<Silverscreen> 11oh, my bad.
<Armageddon> ohai
<Hipster_Brony> 8well that and it would allow us to notify people of the schedule, any changes we make and tell them when the pre-show is starting
<luna> 09,01o00,01hai 09,01y00,01ou 09,01200,01
<Silverscreen> 11We could even put Sethisto and ARGH on the list to keep them updated as well.
<Armageddon> derplesurge
<Hipster_Brony> 8exactly
<Silverscreen> 11....in fact. We could ask ARGH how he does it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Though ARGH is supposed to be having issues with writing the daily /oat/ soon.
<SirSprinkles> 6But we could put his correspondents on the list, so, whatevs.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, ARGH is trying to make a team for The Daily /oat/
<Ghosties> 4True
<Silverscreen> 11True, but since both Hipster and myself will be helping to pick up the slack for ARGH, that won't be a problem.
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgg86krmZb0&feature=related < Win
<Chimera> 04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7lEIcK7cJU <-- this is just as epic
<prince-dari> Since I'll won't be on much/at all for the next few weeks/month just thought I'd say that I added some commands for the colour bot.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, getting our stuff in the daily /oat/ shouldn't be a problem since 2 of the BMN mods are working for it now
<Hipster_Brony> 8infiltration complete
<prince-dari> !colscripton !colscriptoff to turn it on and off, !addmod to add people to the list, and !remmod to take people off it.
<prince-dari> So !addmod namehere or !remmod namehere
<Silverscreen> 11Nice. Thank you, Dari.
<Ghosties> 4Oh, Silver and Hipster got selected to join The Daily Oat?
<Aeroslash> true that, Chimera
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster's going to monitor /chat/ and /oat/ for stories. I'll be collecting from everyone and publishing the thread.
<Ghosties> 4Awesome guys! I was thinking of asking to join myself but decided against it
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, actually im on /chat/, /collab/ and EQD
<Silverscreen> 11oh. Still, we're part of it, which is cool.
<prince-dari> Well gratz on that you two.
<Hipster_Brony> 8indeed
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, so we need to look into how to do a listserv
<Silverscreen> 11So basically we need to find somepony who knows how to work Listserv.
<Hipster_Brony> 8herd mind
<Silverscreen> 11or look into ourselves, like hipster said.
<prince-dari> Got that already. :P
<Silverscreen> 11I was about to google it myself.
*SirSprinkles 6was in the middle of googling it
<Silverscreen> 11I think that derpy email thing lets you use listerv. It's how ARGH does it.
<prince-dari> INB4 all of you.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> ehow one is probably better.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think its funny how i was never involved with stuff when i was in high school and im not in any campus organizations in college
<Hipster_Brony> 8and now i have all these pony related things that i do
<Hipster_Brony> 8BMN, the daily /oat/, etc...
<Ghosties> 4Same here, Hipster
<Silverscreen> 11Ditto. It wasn't until my last two years of school did I really get into anything.
<SirSprinkles> 6I had... D&D Club... doesn't really count much.
<Silverscreen> 11Actually...not entirely true. I had the drama club until then..
<Silverscreen> 11Then I had the HP club the last two years.
*Armageddon pokes Altair
<Silverscreen> 11I'm a nerd.
<Ghosties> 4...I was also in the Poetry Club my freshmen year of high school (though I left after the second meeting)
*SirSprinkles 6points to "D&D Club" It's okay Silver, we understand
<Hipster_Brony> 8i literally never joined a single club in high school
<Hipster_Brony> 8the most i have gotten involved in college is writing one article for my campus newspaper
<Ghosties> 4Are you a writer, Hipster?
<prince-dari> Ehh, school clubs very big or popular in the UK in general.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<prince-dari> +aren't
<Ghosties> 4Fucking awesome man
<Hipster_Brony> 8i write for an NFL Draft website right now
<Hipster_Brony> 8unpaid of course :(
<Ghosties> 4Are you an intern for the NFL?
*SirSprinkles 6hasn't had a job for five months.
<Hipster_Brony> 8im a journalism minor too
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm a bum!
<Hipster_Brony> 8nah, i wish
<Hipster_Brony> 8im interning for my school's football program though
*Silverscreen 11never had a job. unless one counts working concession stand at baseball games and wrestling tournaments.
<prince-dari> SirSprinkles: So actually you're the man sitting in the corner who lives at that internet cafe place? :P
<Ghosties> 4I've worked three jobs in my life
<Hipster_Brony> 8i am jelly, silver
<Ghosties> 4:O
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope, he's more of a bum than me.
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles IS the bum at the cafe
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<SirSprinkles> 6He's the HOMELESS kind of bum.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm the JOBLESS kind of bum.
<SirSprinkles> 6I think he actually has a job...
<Hipster_Brony> 8lets see how many jobs i have had in my life
<Hipster_Brony> 8worked at pizza hut
<Ghosties> 4I'm an English major, Hipster. My current minor is in Sociology, but I may change it to Philosophy
<prince-dari> What so he's just thinking "I'll save on rent". XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I would lose count as to how many jobs I've had.
<Hipster_Brony> 8was a scene director for a haunted house at Lambeau Field
<Hipster_Brony> 8worked in the campus post office my freshman year
<Hipster_Brony> 8worked custodial at the university of wisconsin for a summer
<SirSprinkles> 6Am I the only one that would crack up if one of the other mods showed up right now?
<prince-dari> I have yet to work being that I am still in secondary school (or highschool for you Americans :P).
<Silverscreen> 11I busted my rump trying to find a job before moving to campus. Hell, From my consession stand work, I figured I'd be more comfortable working in one of the dingy fast food places. But no. Either they wouldn't call me, or if I called them, they'd tell they meant to call and say I'm not right for the job.
<Ghosties> 4Why would you crack up, Sprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6We've already finished the discussion.
<Ghosties> 4We have?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i currently call high school students to recruit for the university
<SirSprinkles> 6It would seem so.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i worked maintenance at a laboratory last summer
<Ghosties> 4Sorry I wasn't very responsive this meeting. I was distracted quite a bit
<Silverscreen> 11Did you get to play with chemicals?
<Silverscreen> 11Chemicals are fun.
<Hipster_Brony> 8now im an intern for my school's football program
<Hipster_Brony> 8nah
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was stupid shit like filling the brine tanks with salt
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was a terrible job
<Hipster_Brony> 8so I have had 7 jobs already and i'm only 20
<Silverscreen> 11The one that upset me the most is when I applied for a job at Sonic. Waited eight fucking hours at this job fair thing they had going on. They didn't choose me because I let it slip that I left for school in 3 months.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah, yeah
<prince-dari> Hey, you still have yet to tell my why 20 is the worst age.
<Ghosties> 4He answered you dari
<Ghosties> 4I think
<prince-dari> When?
<Ghosties> 4More responsibilities, yeah?
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari, you guys can drink at 18, so its not for you
<Hipster_Brony> 8old enough for responsibilities, not old enough to drink
<prince-dari> My sister's already 18, so I'm fine. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6not old enough to be taken seriously in the world
<Ghosties> 4I'm old enough to drink and I don't drink XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8eh, to each their own
<Silverscreen> 11Age and its pros and cons Depends on where you live.
<Ghosties> 4How old is everybody?
<SirSprinkles> 6 20
<Silverscreen> 11 19
<prince-dari> I'm 15.
<SirSprinkles> 6We've been over this I think.
<prince-dari> Probably.
<SirSprinkles> 6HOLY FARKING FARK DARI
<Hipster_Brony> 8im a little worried about going to bars now though
<Ghosties> 4 23
<Hipster_Brony> 8Ohio just passed a law that makes it legal for people to carry loaded weapons into bars
<Ghosties> 4Damn, I'm the oldest mod here at the moment :/
<Silverscreen> 11good for you. :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think DCD is older though
<prince-dari> Well, I suppose that makes me the youngest.
<Ghosties> 4And holy crap at dari
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, DCD is 29 I think
<prince-dari> Lack of responsibilites is fun, I will admit.
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, it does, Dari.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah dari, i though you were like 17 or something
<Hipster_Brony> 8i wish i was a kid again
<Ghosties> 4Dari's a freaking minor minor
<SirSprinkles> 6I thought you were 17-18... Oo
<Hipster_Brony> 8being an adult blows
<Ghosties> 4Indeed
<Ghosties> 4Don't ever grow up dari
<Ghosties> 4Seriously
<SirSprinkles> 6*get taken to neverland*
<prince-dari> Haha, if I had a choice in it maybe I wouldn't. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6*be a kid forever*
<Silverscreen> 11Yep. 19. No drugs. NO alchohol. Refuse to so much as touch a cig. Very few parties. Didn't even go to prom. My life is rather dull.
<SirSprinkles> 6*realize neverland doesn't have ponies*
<SirSprinkles> 6:(
<Ghosties> 4I agree with Silverscreen though
<Ghosties> 4I refuse to touch alcohol or drugs
<Ghosties> 4or even cigarettes
<Hipster_Brony> 8this video sums up my feelings on adulthood: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5gw0qUPxgU
<prince-dari> Cigarettes, meh. Alcohol I see no problem with if it's not to excess.
<Silverscreen> 11I guess I wouldn't mind it just for a hands-on experience (drugs and alchohol, not the cigs), but I know how much of an addictive personality I have.
<SirSprinkles> 6 20. Have smoked weed. Used to drink daily. Used to smoke daily. Used to go to parties constanly. Went to prom with two dates.
<Hipster_Brony> 8cigs are terrible, i cant stand them
<SirSprinkles> 6I gave them up.
<Silverscreen> 11Billy Madison?
<SirSprinkles> 6Took me forever to quit.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i drink fairly frequently, but i dont like beer
<Hipster_Brony> 8indeed silver
<SirSprinkles> 6I still drink.
<SirSprinkles> 6But not frequently.
<Silverscreen> 11very nice.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have smoked weed a few times, i liked it
<SirSprinkles> 6Never go to parties anymore.
<Silverscreen> 11The only booze I drink is a single glass of whine every year for New Years.
<SirSprinkles> 6I still smoke, but I never pay for it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would probably do it more often if i had the opportunity
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much Hipster. Cherish your youth, for as long as humanly possible
<SirSprinkles> 6I've smoked people up enough times that they'll smoke me up every now and then.
<prince-dari> I only drink at parties really, sometimes at meals with my parents.
<Hipster_Brony> 8let me tell you
<Hipster_Brony> 8one of the greatest experiences of my life was smoking pot at Pitchfork last year and watching Delorean
<Silverscreen> 11I wouldn't mind drinking. It's actually getting drunk that I'd like to avoid.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was like the happiest moment of my life
<Silverscreen> 11Delorean? As in hitting 88 and seeing serious shit?
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Hipster_Brony> 8nah, they're a spanish synthpop band
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't smoke weed much anymore. If anything I'll smoke red magic, since it's legal and like, six times as strong.
<prince-dari> I love Back to the Future.
<Silverscreen> 11ah
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC_hcOtYv9E
<Hipster_Brony> 8delorean
<Hipster_Brony> 8its pure bliss even without drugs
<Silverscreen> 11I see the pic and I instantly think WHIP IT!
<SirSprinkles> 6 6:08 That's a lot of my time to devote to a song.
<Silverscreen> 11this song is freaky.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it will make you happy
<SirSprinkles> 6This song already makes me feel high.
<Silverscreen> 11I know, right?
*Silverscreen 11gives derp eyes.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it has a weird effect on me
<Hipster_Brony> 8on start grinning oddly when i listen to it
<Hipster_Brony> 8i
<SirSprinkles> 6Is that image moving?!
<Hipster_Brony> 8why did i write "on" there
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont think so
<Silverscreen> 11because you're high?
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to get glasses...
<SirSprinkles> 6I used to have contacts...
<SirSprinkles> 6But they got stuck in my eye, started getting infected, and I had to go to the ER.
<Silverscreen> 11anyone stay up so late that the computer screen images start to swim in front of your eyes?
<SirSprinkles> 6The day before my b-day, too.
<prince-dari> Hmm, sounds nasty.
<SirSprinkles> 6I've stayed up on ponychan for two allnighters straight.
<SirSprinkles> 6Never again.
<SirSprinkles> 6I was a pony.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i cant stay up past midnight much anymore
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Hipster_Brony> 8it fucks me up too much for work
<prince-dari> Your brain must have melted.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was like Double Rainbow Syndrome, only reality.
<Silverscreen> 11They say that Fatigue gives the same effects as getting drunk.
<Hipster_Brony> 8my brother once was up for 47 hours for school
<Hipster_Brony> 8he said he was hallucinating rain by the end
<SirSprinkles> 6Everything was the wrong color.
<SirSprinkles> 6NEVER AGAIN.
<prince-dari> I had some weird thing going a couple of weeks ago.
<prince-dari> Slept a bit during the day stayed up all night for my exams the next day.
<prince-dari> Didn't feel tired until after I got home, so it went fine.
<prince-dari> And I didn't forget anything I revised because I didn't go to sleep that night.
<prince-dari> Worked out kind of well.
<Silverscreen> 11I only managed to stay up a full 24 hours once. And that was because I was determined as hell to beat Sonic Adventure.
<prince-dari> Speaking of which, I should probably get some sleep, need to get up in a bit over 6 hours.
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz dari
<SirSprinkles> 6 6 hours of sleep
*SirSprinkles 6has insomnia
<Silverscreen> 11I discovered I can go about the day on only 4 hours of sleep.
<SirSprinkles> 6 3-4 for me
<prince-dari> Well I'll talk to you guys in what, a month? Bye.
<Silverscreen> 11any less and I'm screwed.
<Hipster_Brony> 8see ya dari
<SirSprinkles> 6...a month? Jeebus.
<Silverscreen> 11See you around, Dari.
<SirSprinkles> 6See ya Dari.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have trouble functioning on less than 7 hours
<prince-dari> Cya (not actually leaving the room BTW)
<EpicStatsGuy> <Drake> I'm angry.
<Silverscreen> 11of course you aren't. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6THE ROOM
<SirSprinkles> 6*brain melts*
<Silverscreen> 11TOMMY WISEAU'S ASS!
<Silverscreen> 11*brainbleach*
<SirSprinkles> 6CAN NOT UNSEE
<Silverscreen> 11Naval sex. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6lobotomy.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> 8DAT ASS
<Armageddon> :o
<Silverscreen> 11Random thought, if someone requests a movie we've already watched, we'd just watch it again anyway, right?
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://archive.no-ip.org/images/co/thumb/0240/64/1299431379567s.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would say no
<SirSprinkles> 6If it has been deemed being long enough, I don't see why not.
<Hipster_Brony> 8at least not yey
<legend_knight_234> michelle
<Hipster_Brony> 8yet*
<SirSprinkles> 6Not for a few months.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont want to watch The Room every other week
<Silverscreen> 11So, say, at least a month in between watching said movie?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd say a three month limit.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would say even longer, actually
<Hipster_Brony> 8i want to get people watching more than just the ones we would expect
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Silverscreen> 11Alright.
<Hipster_Brony> 8 3 months seems reasonable
<Hipster_Brony> 8also
<Silverscreen> 11That means either we need to keep track of what we watch.
<Romeo|Pikmin2> http://i55.tinypic.com/fve4i9.jpg
<Romeo|Pikmin2> 8D
<SirSprinkles> 6I've been keeping a list.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think eventually we should have a "best of" marathon
<SirSprinkles> 6I agree, Hipster.
<Silverscreen> 11Good. 'cause my memory's shit.
<SirSprinkles> 6Like how Ghosties said one weekend we should do the LotR trilogy over three nights.
*Quanyails 7meeps.
<Ghosties> 4WHAT
<Ghosties> 4What about me?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like that idea
<Ghosties> 4Oh yeah
<Ghosties> 4We should
<Hipster_Brony> 8it all depends on when DCD's schedule would allow for the best of thing though
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, that's going to be our little End-Of-Summer special event.
<Ghosties> 4Also, I think 6 months instead of 3 months would be better
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would say we should wait quite a while with that

<Hipster_Brony> 8im cool with that ghosties
<HyperMetalLugia> Also known as the Zekrom/Resh battle theme
<Ghosties> 4A half a year since there's soooooooo many films in existence anyways
<Hipster_Brony> 8do you guys know if theres a mid season break in pony episodes, or do they just go straight through?
<Ghosties> 4I'm not sure
<Silverscreen> 11Was there a break last season?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dunno
<Hipster_Brony> 8i didnt start watching til march
<Silverscreen> 11I don't know either. I watched all on Youtube.
<Ghosties> 4I also started in March
<Hipster_Brony> 8at any rate
<SirSprinkles> 6The only break was the one on April 1.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if theres a midseason break, we could do the best of then
<Ghosties> 4How would we pick the best of?
<Ghosties> 4Mod vote?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, mod vote
<Silverscreen> 11I'd say Mod vot.
<SirSprinkles> 6Def mod vote
<Silverscreen> 11vote*
<Hipster_Brony> 8superman IV is a shoo-in
<Silverscreen> 11So far, I'd have to say Supes IV, Holy Grail, and The Room.
<SirSprinkles> 6One pick by each mod?
<Hipster_Brony> 8that was our 1st movie, after all
<Ghosties> 4Well, in that case, I already say that Fistful of Dollars should definitely be in. Flute and barrel in jokes for the win
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, let's not get ahead of ourselves
<Silverscreen> 11right.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, yeah.
<Ghosties> 4True
<Hipster_Brony> 8there's going to be a shitload of movies between now and then
<Ghosties> 4But I like the idea that each mod picks one film
<Hipster_Brony> 8and we're gonna have to only pick a few
<Hipster_Brony> 8i agree with that as well
<Ghosties> 4Cool
<Silverscreen> 11That's a good idea.
<Ghosties> 4Man, who knew the BMN would turn into such a project
<SirSprinkles> 6Look at me and all my good freaking ideas.
<Silverscreen> 11SirSprinkles: there's a difference between a break and a dry season. This is the latter.
<SirSprinkles> 6What?
<Silverscreen> 11<SirSprinkles>: The only break was the one on April 1.
<Silverscreen> 11Late response.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, that was the only time there was no ponies, is what I was saying.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have been calling it this "The Great Pony Drought of 2011"
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> Hi
<Hipster_Brony> 8oops
<Hipster_Brony> 8this*
<WontBeUsed> haven been on here for a WHILE
<Ghosties> 4The break inbetween seasons is The Great Pony Drought of 2011. I like it
<Hipster_Brony> 8i cant tell if it caught on, or if somepony else came up with it too, but i have seen it used other places
<Silverscreen> 11I just call it a long ass wait.
<WontBeUsed> it seems that Im the only one on right now or something. :
<WontBeUsed> :/
<legend_knight_234> is that you
<Chimera> 04yes
<Hipster_Brony> 8my thread killing was once again successful, this time, intentional too
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35612214.html
<SirSprinkles> 6Already saw it.
<Silverscreen> 11Epic.
<Ghosties> 4Nice
<Ghosties> 4Anybody wanna tell me how the Keldeo thread ended?
<HyperMetalLugia> no?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i can
<Hipster_Brony> 8he got banhammered
<Hipster_Brony> 8again
<Silverscreen> 11Keldeo's permabanned....again....and the thread was deleted.
<Hipster_Brony> 8claims it wasn't him
<Silverscreen> 11of course.
<Hipster_Brony> 8probably lying
<Hipster_Brony> 8lots of drama
<SirSprinkles> 6He's made the claim before
<Silverscreen> 11But IP states otherwise, according to RDmod.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Spike mod told everyone to save the picture and use it to troll him
<Ghosties> 4Wow. Seriously, Keldeo
<Revy> Ryan take better screenshots
<SirSprinkles> 6And if it wasn't him, why would he care?
<Romeo|Pikmin2> No you
<Ghosties> 4Was he not already permabanned?
<Revy> seriously
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, according to him, he's trying to get the mods to give him a 2nd chance
<SirSprinkles> 6...hahahahaha. No.
<Ghosties> 4nope.avi
<Hipster_Brony> 8but there is 0 chance of that happening
<Silverscreen> 11According to some, he's been trying to get the ban lifted for "Good reasons"
<Hipster_Brony> 8i mean
<Hipster_Brony> 8whats the point of a permaban if it isnt permanent
<Hipster_Brony> 8?
<Ghosties> 4At least that one thread on meta didn't have to do with Keldeo, thank god
<Hipster_Brony> 8are you talking about the one where haackula was bitching?
<Silverscreen> 11what was haack bitching about?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, and Sweetwater too
<Ghosties> 4Sweetwater and Haackula were upset that someone had been banned
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Light_Latias10) 11WB10»11•. 10- * Light_Latias gets herself covered in white stuff oxo <Light_Latias> drf, you got your...your, flower ALL over me D: <Chimera> WAT, LL, Stop going into the glue factory
<Hipster_Brony> 8he was complaining about the mods banning somepony
<Silverscreen> 11ah.
<Ghosties> 4Both Haack and Sweetwater were shouting INJUSTICE!
<Ghosties> 4and CORRUPTION!
<Hipster_Brony> 8was calling the mods corrupt
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya LL :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8generally insulting everyone
<Hipster_Brony> 8im pretty sure he got banhammered for it eventually
<SirSprinkles> 6Haack's such a troll I generally ignore anything he says.
<Hipster_Brony> 8agree sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4I loved that Haack was getting sooooooo upset though, it was pricelss
<Ghosties> 4*priceless
<Hipster_Brony> 8my favorite post was one by sweetwater though
<Silverscreen> 11I generally like Haack, despite him being a parasprite.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was something to the effect of:
<Light_Latias> hiya x-o
<Hipster_Brony> 8"im not trying to start a flame war, im just trying to prove how corrupt and unfair the mods are"
<Silverscreen> 11....wow.
<Ghosties> 4I'm not trying to do anything.....but the mods are evil
<SirSprinkles> 6...so he wasn't trying to start a flame war, he was trying to start a mud fest.
<HyperMetalLugia> What happened this time :<
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> ?
<Silverscreen> 11Hey, did anypony else see that stupid thread made by Hal last night?
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was generally a stupid thread
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<SirSprinkles> 6Where he "gave advice"
<Light_Latias> a long day lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8im kind of mad at myself for getting involved
<Light_Latias> and lol
<Silverscreen> 11Talk about an ego.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh god
<Hipster_Brony> 8that one
<SirSprinkles> 6Somepony said it didn't work for everypony.
<Ghosties> 4My favorite post was by Haack when he posted the rage face and was like: NO HE WAS *NOT* LYING!!!! You could tell he was clearly upset, it was hilarious
<SirSprinkles> 6Instant RAGE
<Light_Latias> "this time"
<Armageddon> brb class
<Revy> 3>8pm
<Armageddon> >10am
<SirSprinkles> 6I think I've been generally upset ONCE in my time on ponychan, and that was today.
<Silverscreen> 11I know. He seemed cool about it, until somepony (don't remember who) said "Just accept that your advice isn't the holy grail" or something.
<Armageddon> actually I was in class an hour ago
<Hipster_Brony> 8was it turnibrony?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Ghosties> 4What was it Sprinkles?
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Ghosties> 4Well
<SirSprinkles> 6The post with the listed numbers.
<Ghosties> 4Turni likes to bitch
<Ghosties> 4a lot
<Revy> fuck timezones
*junh1024-XD np: Black Eyed Peas - The Time (Dirty Bit) m4a@256kps
<Silverscreen> 11Listed numbers?
<Hipster_Brony> 8not gonna lie, i was really upset when he talked about paying us off
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know it was a joke, but still
<Silverscreen> 11wait, what?
<Silverscreen> 11I missed this thread.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was a combination of that, and that he called us soft. I went full rage mode.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's in the discussion thread.
<Hipster_Brony> 8he was saying he wanted to pay us off to pick his movies
<Silverscreen> 11Tell him to fuck off.
<Silverscreen> 11I don't play that corruption bullshit.
<SirSprinkles> 6Basically did.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i honestly considered banning him from BMN forever for that post
<SirSprinkles> 6I warned that if he parasprited more on ponychan I'd call a mod on him.
<Ghosties> 4Again, Turni just likes to bitch because he doesn't like what other people pick for their choices
*Silverscreen 11needs to find the new discussion thread now.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was funny that sprinkles and i both posted lists telling him off
<SirSprinkles> 6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/216598.html
<Hipster_Brony> 8ill post for you silver
<Hipster_Brony> 8nm
<Silverscreen> 11Thanks.
<Chimera> 04Hi LL :3
*SirSprinkles 6was on the thread already
<Light_Latias> hai Chime
<Silverscreen> 11Pardon me. I may be late to it, but I'm going to take my gloves off for this guy.
<SirSprinkles> 6You can clearly tell where I go from being in a good, polite mood, to being pissed.
<Ghosties> 4I wonder if it was too much, but I was kinda upset that he announced to us that he wasn't going to be there Friday
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver: dont
<Hipster_Brony> 8we told him off already, he'll just keep at it if feed him
<Silverscreen> 11I don't mind when people say they won't be their. That's their choice. But if they start downtalking about it just because they don't like the choices, that's when I think something needs to be said.
<Silverscreen> 11Alright.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's been handled for now. If he keeps up, he'll get reported. I already told him that.
<Silverscreen> 11there*
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Ghosties> 4Hah
<Ghosties> 4Oh yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8and honestly, if he pulls anymore shit in our threads, he's ban on sight from BMN
<Silverscreen> 11If he ever comes.
<Ghosties> 4I remember he called me soft a week ago
<SirSprinkles> 6Agreed.
<SirSprinkles> 6Called me soft this week. I flipped. I don't take shit.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i can put up with a lot of shit, but i will not have someone like him questioning my integrity or professionalism
<Armageddon> XD
<Silverscreen> 11Seriously, what evidence does he have about calling us soft? I'm logical, but I'll bomb anyone who gets on my bad side.
<Ghosties> 4Well I'm not gonna RAGE if he calls me soft, I'll be the bigger man and keep my cool. It's just that he didn't see what the big deal is with nudity or excessive violence
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Quanyails> 7LL?
<Quanyails> 7Your character is primarily a Latias, right? :P
<Silverscreen> 11ah.
*Light_Latias nods
<SirSprinkles> 6I didn't RAGE, I kept my cool. I just did so in a more... threatening manner.
<Silverscreen> 11so that's what it was about.
<Light_Latias> why do you ask? and hai
<Ghosties> 4Thing is
<Ghosties> 4Turni never once really got upset
<Quanyails> 7Hello, too.
<Ghosties> 4So I'm not gonna get upset over him either
<Silverscreen> 11Considering our judgement on it, I don't see us being soft at all.
<Quanyails> 7And I'm collecting data.
<Quanyails> 7Of primary pokemon personas. :P
<Eevee> hai
<Ghosties> 4And I know you didn't Sprinkles
<Light_Latias> oh
<Silverscreen> 11I mean, we watched Evil Dead which is packed with violence, and we watched the room which has (horribly done) sex scenes in it.
<Light_Latias> interesting o.o
<Ghosties> 4But
<Ghosties> 4We let people know about the content in advance
<Light_Latias> and hai Eevee
<Silverscreen> 11Which isn't being soft, it's being cautious.
<Ghosties> 4There ARE minors on the site, and even though I'm sure just about everyone is desensitized to violence and nudity, I'd rather be professional than stupid
<Silverscreen> 11Right. Not to mention that the last thing we need is to be chewed out by someone's over-moraled mommy or daddy for streaming stuff like that without them knowing about it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8exactly
<Ghosties> 4Bingo
<Hipster_Brony> 8there was actually somepony in the thread who said he left during the room because he was underage and it wasnt appropriate
<Silverscreen> 11I wanted to give him a big gold star.
<Ghosties> 4That's awesome
<Light_Latias> "I've got a person in my closet"
<Silverscreen> 11I saw that post.
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles, you're not upset are you? I didn't mean to offend you if I did, bro
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<SirSprinkles> 6Like I said, takes a good bit to upset me.
*Light_Latias lols
<Quanyails> 7By the way, Eeve?
<Quanyails> 7Eevee*
<Silverscreen> 11I easily get upset if someone tries to go after me on a personal level. Otherwise, I stick with my logical thinking.
<Eevee> +=20.18.39=+ <Light_Latias> "I've got a person in my closet" <-- sounds about right
<Quanyails> 7"the unforgettable sense of being" <-- I've heard that in multiple places. Where's it from?
<Eevee> what
<Eevee> how did bolb
<Eevee> lsda;kjf
<Eevee> i hate you me
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Eevee> it's from a song
<Eevee> bold*
<Eevee> also
<SirSprinkles> 6The only real way to get to me is on a personal level, which is why I reacted as I did when he called me soft.
<Eevee> yeah song
<Quanyails> 7All right.
<Ghosties> 4Alright, I just don't want any bad feeling between us man. I like you, you're mah pony pirate ^_^
<Eevee> i've been using that for years
<SirSprinkles> 6Yar Har
<Light_Latias> didnt Xeli have that in his profile at one time?
<Silverscreen> 11YAR!
<Eevee> it feels odd to say that to be honest but it's true :V
<Silverscreen> 11BY CELESTIA'S BEARD!
<Ghosties> 4I need to read that comic
<Ghosties> 4I've only seen the beginning
<SirSprinkles> 6Suddenly viking pirates.
<Silverscreen> 11That's a comic? o.O
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i thought it was only those 3 or 4 panels
<Silverscreen> 11I thought it was a one-time gag pic.
<Eevee> +=20.21.47=+ -NickServ- Eevee is the unforgettable sense of being
<Hipster_Brony> 8eh, im not really a comic kind of guy
<Ghosties> 4I've seen that it's a comic, but I could be wrong? Sprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm pretty sure it's a comic.
<SirSprinkles> 6From what I hear from my brony friends around here.

<Silverscreen> 11I am dissapoint.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dissapoint indeed.
<Silverscreen> 11The first one was the best. The other two were good in that they kept a decent plot going in each. The fourth one....bleh.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not surprised in the least.
<Hipster_Brony> 8damn
<Hipster_Brony> 8i cannot find a good "secret butt fun" pic anywhere

<Silverscreen> 11With all the "DON'T LET CHILDREN SEE IT" going on these days, it's a damn miracle that phrase occured.

<Silverscreen> 11I want another pizza, but the pizza place is closed on Sunday.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm IN A CAFE. People are eating all around me.
<Silverscreen> 11SirSprinkles: I've lived off of Ramen and water the past month.
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to get paid so I can get some.
<SirSprinkles> 6That's what I've been eating mostly.
<SirSprinkles> 6For the past five months.
<Silverscreen> 11I put Adobo in mine.
<Silverscreen> 11I put Adobo in everything anymore.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have a large stockpile of soup, chef boyardee and easy mac
<Silverscreen> 11I fucking love Adobo seasoning.
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's only 1:36am ~
*Quanyails 7takes a deep breath.
<Ghosties> 4I have a SECRET BUTT FUN pic on my laptop but I don't know how I could get it up here in the chat
<Hipster_Brony> 8plus there is a subway across the street and the chipotle chicken and cheese is the $5 footlong of the month
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to get paid so I can get all my cheap food.
<Angel_Espeon> 1312 hours from now, I'll be doing an English Language exam |D
<Quanyails> 7I'm gonna be up writing an hour's worth of biology for a fakemon. O_o
<Silverscreen> 11ghosties: use Tinypic.com
<SirSprinkles> 6Last week I lived off a giant box of poptarts.
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o Dedication
<Quanyails> 7Creativity, more like. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6$5 for a box of 18 packs of poptarts.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, and i inexplicably have a shitload of bagels here
<Silverscreen> 11I live a good fifteen minutes away from anyplace other than the college's cafe, which is expensive as hell.
<Quanyails> 7Wanna see a preview of what the fakemon is? :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8im not entirely sure how they got here
<SirSprinkles> 6My dad buys bagels constantly. They never last the day.
<Silverscreen> 11Fifteen minutes, by driving.
<Chimera> 04Wuan
<Silverscreen> 11DO you have cream cheese?
<Chimera> 04*Quan

<Quanyails> 7Wow, nice job.

<Silverscreen> 11Because the Pegasi ponies told you it would?
<Ghosties> 4Thanks Sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4Er

<Chimera> 04so yeah
<SirSprinkles> 6Cream cheese = pure win
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was looking for just the screencap of the dog tho
<Ghosties> 4Hmmm
<Hipster_Brony> 8its cool though, i just used a small one
<Ghosties> 4Wait
<Ghosties> 4I may have that
<Silverscreen> oh DAMNIT
<Silverscreen> The page refreshed on me again.
<Silverscreen> stupid.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i love how this show has all these submemes
<Chimera> 04Like the way I kinda combined B/W's graphics with the pre-DS interface, Quan?
<Chimera> 04:P
<Hipster_Brony> 8im still trying to make the flute one of them
<Silverscreen> 11lol, Clint flutewood.
<Chimera> 04hi sheeeeeeeena
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.taalmusicals.com/images/20110429_63503am_flute6holes.jpg
<SheenaFox|Afk> |D
<SheenaFox|Afk> hi Chimera
<SheenaFox|Afk> sorry but brb, dinner

<Ghosties> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=35ipz0y&s=7
<Ghosties> There you go, Hipster
<SirSprinkles> 6Clint flutewood will kill you with barrels.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and as pissed as i was at turnibrony, i loved that he kept putting HEE HEE HEE HEE in his posts
<Silverscreen> 11That damn laugh.
<Hipster_Brony> 8awesome, thanks
<SirSprinkles> 6BMN does have a lot of submemes...
<Ghosties> 4Not a problem :)
<Ghosties> 4WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER
<Ghosties> 4that's one
<Hipster_Brony> 8theres the wall repair vision too
<SirSprinkles> 6CAMERAMEN ON MOTORCYCLES
<Silverscreen> 11Major props for DCD for the cool music overlays he did with The Room.
<Silverscreen> 11EVIL CAMERAMAN!!!!
<Hipster_Brony> 8CLIMAX TIME!
<Hipster_Brony> 8Captain Marvelous
<Ghosties> 4I was getting a littttttttle frustrated however when DCD kept stopping the movie to play more music over it
<SirSprinkles> 6Just a bit.
<Quanyails> 7Late, Chimy, but I was AFK>
<Armageddon> ;o
<Ghosties> 4I thought the first time was excellent, but then it started getting annoying
<Silverscreen> 11that was a little annoying.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was awesome the first time. Not the tenth.
<Ghosties> 4Exactly, Sprinkles
<Hipster_Brony> 8agreed
<Chimera> 04k
<Hipster_Brony> 8we should do a test screening in the future for stuff like that
<Hipster_Brony> 8so we can work it out ahead of time
<Chimera> 04so yeah
<Chimera> 04Like?
<Ghosties> 4Perhaps
<Ascendant> stare
<Ascendant> !nick ScriptBot
<SirSprinkles> 6Only for REALLY bad movies though.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
*Chimera stares at Ascendant
<SirSprinkles> 6Don't want to take away from movies that are actually good/funny on their own.
*Ascendant glares back
<Hipster_Brony> 8for sure
<Ascendant> ;D
<Chimera> 04lol glare |3
<Silverscreen> 11yeah. The guile's theme thing was hilarious.
<SirSprinkles> 6O HAI DANNY
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was disappointed he didnt play baker street until the post show though
<Silverscreen> 11OH HAI SPRINKLES!
<SirSprinkles> 6New BMN meme is.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its the perfect sex scene music
<Ghosties> 4>mfw the kid's name is actually Denny
<SirSprinkles> 6ULTIMATE BROHOOF
<Ghosties> 4That annoyed me to like no end when we were watching The Room
<Silverscreen> 11ULTIMATE BROHOOF!!!
<Hipster_Brony> 8i always thought it was danny
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have watched that movie like 5 times and always thought it was danny
<Ghosties> 4Nope, it was Denny
<SirSprinkles> 6I thought it was Danny too...
<Silverscreen> 11I thought I heard an "e" in there.
<SirSprinkles> 6Curse you and your bad accent!
<SirSprinkles> 6OH HAI DOGGY
<Silverscreen> 11lol that scene.
<Quanyails> 7Pre-DS interface? *late*}
<Hipster_Brony> 8considering how generically named all the characters are, i would have thought it would be danny
<SirSprinkles> 6So how's your sex life?
<Quanyails> 7The font might need to be changed. :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8right after that part
<Silverscreen> 11How wooden can one's acting be?
<Ghosties> 4I just like to watch you guys
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD should have played the Flutterguy "I don't want to talk about it" clip
<Silverscreen> 11I swear, I saw absolutely no emotion from Wiseau through that whole movie.
<Ghosties> 4It wasn't JUST the acting, the personalities were creepy too
<SirSprinkles> 6The Fatality when he killed himself was pretty awesome.
<Hipster_Brony> 8even his end of movie tantrum was strangely calm
<Quanyails> 7And you might need to expand your audience for that flash.
<Silverscreen> 11Hara Kiri.
<Ghosties> 4Denny was like the overbearing landlord who "just liked to watch" Lisa and Johnny have sex
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would have lol'd more if it we're "HEADSHOT" from unreal tournament
<Hipster_Brony> 8i played that game so much when i was a kid
<Hipster_Brony> 8were*
<Silverscreen> 11Hara Kiri is the MK term for suicide. :D
<Silverscreen> 11*themoreyouknowstar*
<Hipster_Brony> 8unnecessary apostrophe
<Ghosties> 4Actually
<Ghosties> 4Silver
<Chimera> 04Hm?
<Silverscreen> 11o.o what?
<Chimera> 04And what's wrong with the font?
<Quanyails> 7I can see this becoming really popular, seeing how well it's done.
<Chimera> 04Wow
<Chimera> 04Thanks :D
<Quanyails> 7Well, the 'pokemon' one in particular; it's rather squished.
<Ghosties> 4*pulls out nerd glasses* Hara Kiri wasn't originally from MK. Hara Kiri was the term that old samurais and shoguns called a honorable suicide in feudal Japan
<Chimera> 04Ah
<Chimera> 04I made them squished for a reason
<Silverscreen> 11But it's still the term MK uses for the suicide moves.
<Chimera> 04so the curser could fit
<Ghosties> 4*pulls up suspenders* And in MK Deadly Alliance, Kenshi was the only character to have a true "Hara Kiri"
<Chimera> 04It's readable at least, though.
<SirSprinkles> 6*took three years of Japanese* I couldn't stop but twitch my eyes at that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8good lord
<Silverscreen> 11I remember. He did the whole *sword to gut* samurai death.
<Hipster_Brony> 8somepony made a gen 1 appreciation thread on /oat/
<Hipster_Brony> 8KILL IT WITH FIRE!
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Silverscreen> 11KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!!
*Silverscreen 11gets the napalm
<Ghosties> 4*wears pocket protector* And Hara Kiri isn't pronounced "hara" but "harry" and Kiri is pronounced "karry"
<Ghosties> 4Or carry
<SirSprinkles> 6WRONG
<Silverscreen> 11....so you pull a Harry Carry? Sounds like a creeper.
<Chimera> 04and by pre-DS interface, I meant the lack of a bottom screen
<Ghosties> 4Well, dear Sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4Your rebuttal?
<SirSprinkles> 6That's the poor English mistranslation.
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<SirSprinkles> 6It actually is "Hara Kiri"
<Chimera> 04And how, like the GB, GBC, and GBA, the moves' stats are listed on the right, while the selectable moves on the left.
<Ghosties> 4Not how I've seen it
<Chimera> 04Btw like that arrow effect I made?
<Ghosties> 4*shrugs* Hell, I don't particularly care anyways
<Steve> 12 Hello, Aristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Hipster_Brony> 8Fun fact, Harry Caray was a broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs, the most pathetic franchise in baseball
<Quanyails> 7Arrow? O.o
<Aristeo> rawr!
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz Hipster
<Chimera> 04K
<Chimera> 04When you get to "What will Snivy do?" press "Z" on "FIGHT"
<Hipster_Brony> 8I'm a Brewers fan
<Chimera> 04make sure you click the flash, though
<Quanyails> 7Oh, Z?
<Chimera> 04because it won't register your key press unless you do |D
<Chimera> 04yep
<Quanyails> 7Computer logic tells me to press Enter.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it's legally required that I hate the Cubs
<Hipster_Brony> 8but even if it wasn't, I would still hate them
<Chimera> 04Game logic says Z
<Chimera> 04:P
<Quanyails> 7Mention that in your description. o3o
<Quanyails> 7Computer logic says Enter. D:
<Chimera> 04k
<Chimera> 04So, like it?
<Quanyails> 7And after you press Z, do you have to refresh to reset it?
<SirSprinkles> 6Not a huge fan of baseball myself.
<Ghosties> 4I'm not either
<Ghosties> 4Though, I will admit that I watched the World Series while I was in high school and I was absolutely THRILLED that the Red Sox won
<SirSprinkles> 6I have nothing against it, I just don't care for it.
<Chimera> 04there added
<Chimera> 04yes lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like all sports
<Quanyails> 7An annoyance. :P
*Silverscreen 11returns from watching all MK: Deception Hara Kiris
<Hipster_Brony> 8except nascar and golf
<Chimera> 04pressing "X" or pressing "Z" again will bring you to a "That's all folks!" screen.
<Hipster_Brony> 8which arent even really sports
<Silverscreen> 11I watch any sport that happens to be on the tv when I turn it on.
<SirSprinkles> 6Nascar is not a sport.
<Chimera> 04Because again this is not finished.
<Armageddon> bbl
<SirSprinkles> 6Golf is barely a sport.
<Chimera> 04Nor is it really a game atm |D
<Silverscreen> 11Nascar is a waste of gas.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would argue that neither are sports at all
<Ghosties> 4@Sprinkles: Don't say that around where I'm at >_>
<Silverscreen> 11Golf is a leisure activity.
<Hipster_Brony> 8golf is a game
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't say that around where I'M at.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I'm in PA
<Hipster_Brony> 8nascar is just retarded
<Ghosties> 4People like Nascar in PA?
<SirSprinkles> 6Quite a few people, unfortunately.
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, they doe.
<Silverscreen> 11do*
<Quanyails> 7I love all the details you put into it. :O
<Ghosties> 4Wow
<Silverscreen> 11My dad was a Dale Earnheart fan.
<Hipster_Brony> 8never would have guessed
<Ghosties> 4And here I thought it was just in the South
<SirSprinkles> 6PA is pretty much where it ends.
<SirSprinkles> 6NY and NJ not so much.
<SirSprinkles> 6But for some reason PA likes it.
<Quanyails> 7The pokeball (opening), the background gradient, the pokemons' animations, moves, etc.
<Silverscreen> 11Seriously, can you imagine how much gasoline we'd still have if Nascar didn't exist, though?
<Hipster_Brony> 8Nopony I know in Ohio likes it
<SirSprinkles> 6My dad is a HUGE fan of Nascar.
<Ghosties> 4@Silver: My dad still IS a Dale Earnhardt fan. One of the biggest ones I know, actually
<Chimera> 04yes
<Chimera> 04I have an eye for detail :3
<SilverSonic> kk
<SilverSonic> o3o
<Hipster_Brony> 8i regularly troll nascar fans IRL when i see them
<SirSprinkles> 6THEY'RE MAKIN A LEFT TURN!
<Silverscreen> 11Think about it. Five hundred laps with twenty cars. Not to mention all the fuel that's spilled durring fillups AND the driving.
<SirSprinkles> 6Twenty? Ha.
<Ghosties> 4It's not just twenty
<Silverscreen> 11At minimum, SirSprinkles.
<Silverscreen> 11At minimum.
<Ghosties> 4There's about 43 out there
<Silverscreen> 11I've seen races dwindle down to only twenty, hence, it's the minimum. :P
<Ghosties> 4Eh, that is a good point. By the end, there's only about a handful left
<Silverscreen> 11I don't get the appeal of watching a race either.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not lately. Anymore there's a lot more safety involved.
<Silverscreen> 11It's just a bunch of douchbags driving in a circle.
<SirSprinkles> 6Most cars make it through the race.
<Ghosties> 4I'm waiting for the day when Nascar races are peeled back to about 10 a year
<SirSprinkles> 6The only real appeal in it is the betting.
<Hipster_Brony> 8idk if any of you guys read the onion but...
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.onionsportsnetwork.com/articles/nascar-awards-driver-50000-for-homophobic-comments,20611/
<Ghosties> 4Nah, I'm not a fan
<Ghosties> 4But I'll read it
<Hipster_Brony> 8the onion is sheer brilliance
<Silverscreen> 11lol at how The Onion caused a huge Facebook war with a Harry Potter story.
<Hipster_Brony> 8they do that all the time too
<SirSprinkles> 6lol The Onion is hilarious.
<Hipster_Brony> 8people constantly mix up their stories for real ones
<Ghosties> 4Hah, it was pretty decent
<Ghosties> 4I'm generally not a fan of sports in the least
<Ghosties> 4There's only one sport that I actually like and keep up with (usually)
*Silverscreen 11is thinking of having his own personal Brony Movie Night tonight...
<Ghosties> 4If you could call it a sport, I know some people don't
<Silverscreen> 11...or tomorrow night, considering how late it is already.
<SirSprinkles> 6brb
<Ghosties> 4Your own personal BMN?
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSoIuUfwZdxLQYqBWWdIrA0qDR94ZU4F4CXkK6ifwNsUEZAZV8S&t=1
<Silverscreen> 11Well, a little movie thing for me to enjoy. Whatever you want to call it.
<Ghosties> 4@Hipster: Skateboarding, I've been a big fan since I was a kid
<Silverscreen> 11Skateboarding is a cool sport.
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kpowqoR2Wn1qzma4ho1_400.jpg
<Silverscreen> 11I used to bowl.
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats better
<Silverscreen> 11used to.
<Ghosties> 4Unfortunately I can't skate at all >_<
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah, not a big fan of "extreme sports"
<Hipster_Brony> 8i pretty much tune out everything thats in the x games
<Chimera> 04chat died XD
<Ghosties> 4The X Games vibe is pretty fucking douchy, but I don't particularly pay attention because I just want to see how the skaters do
<Silverscreen> 11I only watch the x-games to watch the carrot top Shawn White snowboarding.
<Quanyails> 7Derpworm is what I think of when I see my fakemon. O_o
<Silverscreen> 11....why do my posts silence this place?
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Ghosties> 4That's another sport that I also like, I'm sooo looking forward to the new SSX this year
<Hipster_Brony> 8at least your posts on Ponychan don't like mine do
<Silverscreen> 11Not true. I've seen several really good threads die when I post.
<Silverscreen> 11Then again, I have a bad habbit of leading into an RP.
<Ghosties> 4WOAH
<Hipster_Brony> 8do ALL of them die when you post though?
<Ghosties> 4Where did Sprinkles go?
<Hipster_Brony> 8he said brb a few mins ago
<Chimera> 04heh
<Ghosties> 4....oh yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8when i post in a thread, one of 2 things happens
<Hipster_Brony> 8 1. it instantly kills the thread
<Quanyails> 7(It is based off of an earthworm... partially.)
<Hipster_Brony> 8 2. people ignore whatever i wrote and continue as though i never posted
<Chimera> 04lul
<Ghosties> 4Whenever I post in a thread, it's rare
<Ghosties> 4I mostly lurk Ponychan
<Hipster_Brony> 8i try and post frequently
<Silverscreen> 11I'm a little in between. I'll lurk when nothing interests me, then I'm ignored if the thread's moving too fast.
<HyperMetalLugia> Earthworm Jim?
<Quanyails> 7Nope. o3o
<Hipster_Brony> 8trying to get to know more people on the site by posting as much as i can
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I'm posting more and more lately. Though, I don't post in /oat/ much
<Ghosties> 4Yesterday, I was involved in a combat thread though, that was fun. AND, in the same thread, someone drew an OC pony for me.
<Ghosties> 4I was pretty freaking happy about it ^^
<Silverscreen> 11You know what really annoys me? When I get to know someone in places like this, then they randomly vanish into oblivion.
<Ghosties> 4I'll never vanish Silver
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont think ive had that happen to me yet, fortunately
<Silverscreen> 11inb4 elderscrolls reference.
<Ray> 02Kosoveon~~~~
*Quanyails 7gives her earthworm the move Nasty Plot. :3
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Kosoveon> Ray~~~~
<Ghosties> 4....
<Ghosties> 4I thought of Elder Scrolls
<Kosoveon> What's up~~~~
<Hipster_Brony> 8prison is back from his ban
<Silverscreen> 11who?
<Ray> 02Homewooork, like usual xD
<Hipster_Brony> 8hes the guy that haackula and sweetwater were stirring up shit about
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was a bill nye the science guy thread
<Silverscreen> 11Wait, so the ban was a temp ban?
*Ray plays with Kosov(e)o(n)'s tail
<Hipster_Brony> 8and he posted some stuff that was a little bit racist and some sexually explicit stuff
<Kosoveon> Same
*Kosoveon huggles
<Hipster_Brony> 8he got a 3 day ban for it
<Kosoveon> have like 3 projects due this week x.x
<Silverscreen> 11Eh, a bit excessive, but still, it was only temperary.
<Ghosties> 4INJUSTICE
<Ghosties> 4CORRUPTION
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, even some of the mods acknowledged that it was a bit much
<SirSprinkles> 6Back on this topic?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think one of them implied he had been posting inappropriate stuff on other threads
<Quanyails> 7Long list of potential moves is loooong.
<Quanyails> 7And I feel the same way, Kosoveon.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, cuz the guy who originally got banned is back now
<Quanyails> 7Four projects, actually.
<Silverscreen> 11he's not stirring up shit is he?
<SirSprinkles> 6oh joy.
<Ghosties> 4Lol Sprinkles comes back to Haack and Sweetwater
<Hipster_Brony> 8nah
<Hipster_Brony> 8he actually wrote a big long post on /meta/ apologizing for the stuff that got him banned and for haack and sweetwaters actions
<Silverscreen> 11That's awesome.
<Ghosties> 4FUCK YES
<Altair> derp

*Ghosties 4is going to /meta/ to read the post
<Ghosties> 4*claps* that was a pretty awesome post by Prison
<Hipster_Brony> 8some dude on 4chan is trying to start a "long term" raid on Ponychan and failing miserably

<Silverscreen> 11When will they realize that 1: We can see their threads when planning to raid us and 2: We'll love and tolerate the shit out of them no matter what?

<Ghosties> 4they're a laugh
<Silverscreen> 11I find it hilarious that he's referring to us as a cancer.
<Hipster_Brony> 8the whole thread is just a giant exercise in fail

<Ghosties> 4Holy fuck, it's like 4chan NEVER learns
<Hipster_Brony> 8immediate influx of bronies
<Hipster_Brony> 8i also enjoyed this post:
<Hipster_Brony> 8Ponychan has a video game board? Maybe I'll go there to actually discuss VIDEO GAMES
<Ghosties> 4Bronies respond to trolls and parasprites through love and tolerance, the fuck is /v/ smoking
<Silverscreen> 11Friendship is Magic is a fantastic show and almost everyone who actually likes cartoons should enjoy it. But the fandom is terrible. Note that this is no different from most other good things.
<Silverscreen> 11An interesting assessment.
<Silverscreen> 11And, surprisingly, quite true in most fandoms.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I saw that same post Hipster
<Ghosties> 4See, I don't mind that post Silver brought up
<Ghosties> 4Because I do think the fandom is flawed
*Armageddon blinks
<Armageddon> ALTAIR
<Silverscreen> 11Agreed. We can be excessive in some things, but that's what happens when you have something you're really into.
<Hipster_Brony> 8theres certain things i like, certain things i dont, but as a whole, i love the fandom

<Silverscreen> 11Ponychan's reaction thread.
<Ghosties> 4 4chan's /v/ is supposedly raiding ponychan or some shit
<Ghosties> 4but /v/'s so goddamn disorganized most of the time to do anything other than become distracted by shiny objects or bicker amongst themselves about who's gaming dick is bigger
<Hipster_Brony> 8im so glad i never got into 4chan
<Silverscreen> 11I really didn't see anythign about them wanting to raid us.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i lurked on /b/ once or twice, but thats it
<Silverscreen> 11All I saw was them bitching about ponies being in /v/

<Silverscreen> 11I read that as sarcasm.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, thats not how i took it
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties, why did you just explain what's going on?
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (drf|laptop10) 11WB10»11•. 10- (5:30:26 AM) drf|laptop: and he was like "Dr. Flaptop? // and I was like ... that's a separator
<Ghosties> 4What do you mean, Sprinkles?
<Silverscreen> 11Judging from other posts, half of /v/ talks about anything but video games.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dunno.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i took it to mean that he wanted people to raid ponychan long term to generally make it a shitty place to post
*Silverscreen 11reads Ponychan's reaction thread now.
<Ghosties> 4I said what I said about /v/ because it's usually true. There's way too much infighting for them to ever actually organize to do something
<SirSprinkles> 6I must say, we really shouldn't be posting ponies there if it does tick them off. It's like we're asking for a raid.
<SirSprinkles> 6And yeah, /v/ is incredibly disorganize.
<Ghosties> 4Someone from /v/ asked us to not raid their board since they weren't going to raid Ponychan
<Ghosties> 4But, alas
<SirSprinkles> 6I saw.
<Ghosties> 4I do believe someone posted Ponychan overthere
<Ghosties> 4And so there's a couple threads on /oat/ that are pretty 4chan like
<Ghosties> 4Especially the "newfoals can't whatever" thread
<Quanyails> 7Uh, question:
<Ghosties> 4And everyone's posting the Triforce
<Quanyails> 7Where is potassium most found?
<SirSprinkles> 6It's... bleh.
<HyperMetalLugia> Bananas?
<Hipster_Brony> 8but posting ponies =/= raid
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly the rivalry, if you can even call it that, between ponychan and 4chan just needs to stop.
<HyperMetalLugia> And baked potatoe
<HyperMetalLugia> Tons of potassium there :P
<Ghosties> 4There's a rivalry?
<Hipster_Brony> 8its not even really a rivalry though
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not.
<Ghosties> 4I just thought they were insecure fags that didn't like FiM
<Quanyails> 7Isn't that sodium?
<SirSprinkles> 6Just, for lack of better word on my part.
<SirSprinkles> 6Basically, Ghosties.
<Silverscreen> 11It's because of you dumbasses who keep bringing it up why people spam ponies. Jesus I don't even watch the show but when a picture of a colorful cartoon can send up in a raging fury, they have pretty much the perfect trolling tool to hold over you tools like the OP. Just ignore it and most of them will stop spamming it. Or will continue to post reaction imag
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Hipster_Brony> 8its pretty much some assholes on 4chan that try and raid us from time to time and fail miserably
<Silverscreen> 11This.
<HyperMetalLugia> Not sure, but the skin might have it o.o
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, thats pretty much right
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, pretty much.
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/food/potassium-foods.htm < Here
<Ghosties> 4And look, in that same /v/ thread over there, they're fighting amongst themselves
<Ghosties> 4AGAIN
*Emmi pokes Aristeo
<Aristeo> :D
<Aristeo> Hi!
<SirSprinkles> 6Not surprised.
<Quanyails> 7Ooh, beans.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Ghosties> 4And why exactly would it be such a horrible, life-altering thing for them to post on those boards? People do it with anime shit all the time, why not ponies. Pretty sure you just aren't secure enough in your masculinity to accept someone else posting ponies on "your" board, so you have to act like a 7 year old who thinks he just got cooties
<Ghosties> 4This was someguy's response to a hater on the board.
<Hipster_Brony> 8tee hee
<SirSprinkles> 6Basically.
<Hipster_Brony> 8that was me
<SirSprinkles> 6Nice.

<Hipster_Brony> 8what was the deal with that anyway?
<SirSprinkles> 6I love how the "typical thread on ponychan" image one guy posted was one of Hal's fail advice threads, which nopony really likes.
<Ghosties> 4Are you on /v/, Sprinkles?
<Ghosties> 4Oh, here's the pic
<Quanyails> 7Yeesh, what's with my fakemon and decomposing?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, I'm on /v/
<Ghosties> 4and I have no idea Hipster. I think it's just 4chan being completely retarded again
<Ghosties> 4http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2cdzyq0&s=7
<Silverscreen> 11I'm actually posting logical replies. See how much flame I get for it.
<SirSprinkles> 6...what post is you just now?
<SirSprinkles> 6Three just popped up.
<Ghosties> 4Silverscreen, is that your post about Hal's thread?
<Ghosties> 4As a frequent poster on Ponychan, I can say that that thread was dumb as shit and just some attention whore trying to brag about what awesome people skills he has. The rest of the thread was basically people telling him to fuck off and not be a giant faggot
<Ghosties> 4Was that you?
<Neon> WAH
<SirSprinkles> 6lol chat window just refreshed itself
<Silverscreen> 11nop, that wasn't me.
<Quanyails> 7Well, good night.
<Ghosties> 4Probably Hipster then
<SirSprinkles> 6If you looked up the site information, you'd find that you were in /oat/, a section of ponychan dedicated to randomness. /pony/ is where the serious discussion is held. Please do the research before you try do bash something.
<Silverscreen> 11That one is mine.
<Hipster_Brony> 8wasnt me
<Silverscreen> 11also:
<Silverscreen> 11You do realize that the first example you gave (somepony) was from the show itself, right? So it wasn't the fandom that did that. The second one, however, we happily accept.
<Ghosties> 4Well, whoever's post that was that I put in here is awesome
<Hipster_Brony> 8i lold
<Hipster_Brony> 8wait
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think i was responding to the wrong thing
<Hipster_Brony> 8im so confused
<Ghosties> 4Huh
<Hipster_Brony> 8that thing you posted ghosties
<Hipster_Brony> 8that was me
<Ghosties> 4I think someone on /oat/ is trying to stir up trouble on /v/
<Ghosties> 4Good job, Hip. For someone who never visits 4chan, I can truly say that you could pass as one of them (what with the lingo and all that bullshit)

<Silverscreen> 11:D
<SirSprinkles> 6You sir, win.
<Ghosties> 4I wasn't a part of that drama thread on Ponychan, though I most certainly was around for the lemon thread
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah. that thread was insane.
<SirSprinkles> 6Waiting for their responses...
<Silverscreen> 11I could tell it was serious from one thing: He gave a specific time.

<Ghosties> 4For two reasons
<Ghosties> 4One because it was from a /v/irgin, and two because he's paraspriting his own board

<Ghosties> 4"But I am better than you"
<Lambda> I'm lost
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, that was me again

<Neon> Oh, were you expecting there to be rhyme or reason behind all that?
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> or at the very least behind the "WAH"
<Ghosties> 4Stay salty Hip, you're doing your chan proud
<Neon> WAH is just a generic expression of frustration, I guess.
<Lambda> ah
<Neon> Then I got bored so I formed something to go with it.
<Lambda> why so frustrated?
<Neon> Life is suffocating me.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i try my best
<Lambda> that's not good
<SirSprinkles> 6This whole thing is just hilarious.
<Neon> Nah, it's cool. I'm sort of getting a high from the asphyxiation.
<Lambda> you should make it better so it isn't suffocating you
<Lambda> oh, okay
<Sneas> 03Yes I recommend it :3
<Neon> Well, I punched Life's jugular. It backed off for a bit.
<Neon> Then I reached for a bag of Fritos and it started strangling me.
<Neon> Snuck up while I was off my guard, ya see.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i almost wish there were more pony hatred threads like this, im having fun

<SirSprinkles> 6And it's only 1 day, with an appeal.
<Hipster_Brony> 8how do people know that?
<SirSprinkles> 6I assume the anon that posted that it was was a mod.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah, ok
<Hipster_Brony> 8it always confuses me when they post mod stuff without their mod tags
<Hipster_Brony> 8which is more often than not
<Hipster_Brony> 8just had a thought
<Hipster_Brony> 8we should encourage people to use this place as general pony-related chat during the week
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm honestly surprised we haven't.
<Ghosties> 4Silver was trying to get something like that off the ground
<Ghosties> 4Like a channel dedicated to chatting with bronies
<SirSprinkles> 6Only problem would be that people could create trouble without a mod around.
<Hipster_Brony> 8that could be an issue i suppose
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<SirSprinkles> 6Especially since most of us are same timezone.
<Ghosties> 4There'd have to be mods around all the time
<Jason> Midd_Knight: !!!!!!!!!!
<Ghosties> 4So you're talking about having bronies from different timezones at different times
<Midd_Knight> Heya J.
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, to be perfectly honest, people can do that now
<Midd_Knight> How goes it?

<Hipster_Brony> 8if they wanted to
<Jason> I need to do somethings that I cant do here

<Ghosties> 4I don't know
<Neon> You missed the promo for the WAH season finale.
<Neon> It's gonna be intense.
<SirSprinkles> 6If the place got a good bit of traffic throughout the week, it would mean spammers and trolls.
<Mikey> what's wah?
<Stormy> Don't ask
<Stormy> :P
<Silverscreen> 11ponychan bronies know how to handle spammers and trolls on their own. They've proven that already.

*Silverscreen 11pokes Princ-dari with a stick.

<Hipster_Brony> 8we need more half ops anyway, so we should try and get somepony from Europe
<Silverscreen> 11but most of the Europe bronies are snoozing by the the time we really have anything going on.
<Hipster_Brony> 8I mean, I can hold down chat from 2 PM to 11 PM
<Silverscreen> 11I'm available all day sans 12-5
<Neon> ^ Good advice
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly, I don't have any real time restrictions, seeing as I don't have a job.
<Hipster_Brony> 8but you can't do it overnight
<SirSprinkles> 6I can, actually.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think thats where we have the biggest problem
<Hipster_Brony> 8so like what times?
<Silverscreen> 11Overnighting things?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd be bored to tears, but I could.
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles can, but what about sleep sprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm up until like, 6 in the morning every day anyway.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm always awake by 9
<Hipster_Brony> 8im up at 7, but i have to go to work
<SirSprinkles> 6Only problem is it would kill my personal life.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, i always forget other people have personal lives
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, patrolling a chat would kill my personal life as well
<Kosoveon> hi aurora
<Ghosties> 4Since I have classes this summer and all that
*Silverscreen 11is available from 9-12 then from 5-2
<Ghosties> 4And I should really come out of my room at some point >_>
<Neon> What if... computers... ran things?
<Silverscreen> 11What's this "Personal Life" thing you're talking about?
<SirSprinkles> 6look, an anon
<Silverscreen> 11:P
*Silverscreen 11pokes mib_i54urz with a stick
<Hipster_Brony> 8so if we were to do it now, we would be unmoderated between 2 and 9 am, pretty much?
<Silverscreen> 11Yep.
<Silverscreen> 11Unless we set up a board about getting Euromods for it.
<Silverscreen> 11er, thread, not board.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Ghosties> 4There's a problem with leaving the room unmoderated though
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, we would be getting mods for those hours
<Hipster_Brony> 8im just trying to think what hours we need to fill
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, I can cover whenever.
<Hipster_Brony> 8For the next 2 months at least, Ponychan is pretty much my personal life
<Silverscreen> 11So far it isn't a problem, but that's because there's nopony here.
<Hipster_Brony> 8I don't want to ask you to mod from 2-9 am though
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats not really fair to you
<SirSprinkles> 6Honeslty wouldn't be difficult.
<Ghosties> 4Here's how I see it, if you leave the room unmoderated for anybody then while paraspriting may not be an issue, what if somebody gets smart and tries to find out about the brony state mods room and shit
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can create a new mods room then
<Hipster_Brony> 8honestly we just have to create a new room that only we know the name of
<Ghosties> 4On that topic, we should really create a room that wouldn't be so easy to crack
<Ghosties> 4Brony State Mods is way way too obvious
<SirSprinkles> 6...anon in the room.
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, we have to change it now
<Ghosties> 4>___________________________________________________________>
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties, just PM us the name you want to change it to
<Ghosties> 4yEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT. i HONESTLY DID NOT SEE THE RANDOM ANON UP THERE
<SirSprinkles> 6...now the anon leaves
<SirSprinkles> 6I pointed out the anon as soon as they joined.
<Ghosties> 4Oh shit
<Silverscreen> 11interesting.
<Hipster_Brony> 8honestly not a big deal
<Hipster_Brony> 8we're alone now, so we dont even have to PM
<Hipster_Brony> 8what should the name be?
<Ghosties> 4Well, at least now we can finally come up with a new room ^_^;
<Ghosties> 4Flutes and Barrels?
<Silverscreen> 11Dunno. I'm getting too tired to think of a name right now.
<Silverscreen> 11we could have a floating room.
<Silverscreen> 11meaning we change it every week.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not a bad idea.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, might as well go with that
<Silverscreen> 11decide during mod meetings what the name is, based ont he week's movies.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I'm fine with that
<Hipster_Brony> 8#Flutewood
<Hipster_Brony> 8join it now

<DSD> 4to the far left moves slowly to the right
<DSD> 4It looks like a red dragon
<DSD> 4Now it's not the black griffon but it looks more like a red dragon flying
<DSD> 4That or it's a flying croc
<DSD> 4Maybe a lizard or a hippogriff
<UxieLover1994> 13At least we can get all 32 within' days.
<UxieLover1994> 13The over-hating of a new game has really shown how much people have changed...
<DSD> 4Yea
<DSD> 4Well i'm not sure about the figures
<DSD> 4They maybe days apart maybe weeks or a complete set
<DSD> 4They also may do so different stuff
<DSD> 4For all we know they might do a dark spyro and spyro set
<UxieLover1994> 13E saih: We could get all 32 at the same time, because nobody would want them. (This is a joke)
<DSD> 4Really i think you might be right
<DSD> 4Anyways in the vid Spyro is seen talking to gill grunt and trigger happy
<UxieLover1994> 13Yeah, I estimate that only 5% of the fans of the classic games would buy the game and toys! And two of us are right here!
<DSD> 4But it doesn't look like talking
<UxieLover1994> 13Maybe they don't talk?
<DSD> 4Maybe
<Cynder7> 6Hell yeah! Cloudy Domain music! Now I wanna play AHT.
<DSD> 4Or he is just shaking his head at trigger happy being crazy
<DSD> 4WB Cynder
<Cynder7> 6Thx :P
<DSD> 4:p
<UxieLover1994> 13I just showed a video for the E3, but almost everyone hates the new game
<Cynder7> 6Basically I'm gonna watch another video but I'm just taking a small break.. :P
<Cynder7> 6*watches*
<Cynder7> 6Is it me or does the whole thing kinda sound like Spyro 1 and 3,where in 1 the dragons got frozen and in 3 they got banished..?
<DSD> 4Yea
<DSD> 4But it is sorta like the old games
<DSD> 4Hm my game isn't working
<UxieLover1994> 13Only 42 out of over 450 like the new game!
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm horrified!
<DSD> 4Yea
<Cynder7> 6Spyro looks even uglier in this video.. :P
<DSD> 4Hopeful i am that it pawns all of them
<Cynder7> 6Idk but something just tells me this game'll be at least better than the previous ones..
<UxieLover1994> 13Yep. All those haters are not true fans...
<UxieLover1994> 13 44 good, 433 bad
<Cynder7> 6Honestly I've kinda gotten over Spyro in the past two years but still..If anything new and good comes out,I'd be more than willing to play it..
<Cynder7> 6D:
<DSD> 4Whats funny is the day i looked up to see if they had a new spyro game not long after you pinged me uxie
<UxieLover1994> 13Yeah, it is! :)
<Cynder7> 6No doubt all the negative stuff is coming from the fact that Spyro looks shitty..
<Cynder7> 6Or basically not all but most of it..
<DSD> 4I like the idea of a two player Spyro but you can also pvp
<Cynder7> 6I'm so happy that SC is alive again! :D
<UxieLover1994> 13Yeah, he looks bad, but does it really matter?
<DSD> 4I mean it really shows right there how much time you put into it
<Cynder7> 6Same..Online would be pure awesomeness..
<DSD> 4Yea
<Cynder7> 6It seems that it does matter to quite a few.. ._.
<DSD> 4Yea
<DSD> 4But i like how in most games doing pvp fights don't really matter
<DSD> 4Here it's all about the levels you put in
<Cynder7> 6Maybe they dislike the fact that now they made Spyro a toy or something..,think the whole storyline seems rather lame.. -.-
<UxieLover1994> 13UPDATE: 46 fans, 458 haters!
<DSD> 4I don't know
<UxieLover1994> 13Why can't the haters grow brains?
<DSD> 4I think i like the idea of a toy of Spyro
<Cynder7> 6I hope the levels are really huge areas..
<DSD> 4Where you can play off game or on game
<DSD> 4With friends or without
<Cynder7> 6I'm not sure about how much I like it.. :P
<DSD> 4:p
<Cynder7> 6Can Spyro fly in this game? Like he did in DotD?
<DSD> 4Fly like free fly mode?
<DSD> 4I'm not sure
<UxieLover1994> 13I've made up plenty of Spyro stories (from the classic series). Why not make it into a TV series that takes place after Shadow Legacy?
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..
<DSD> 4But he has been seen to hover and fly around
<Cynder7> 6Why did they cancel the movie?
<UxieLover1994> 13That's what Activision should also do to keep the old fans
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..It'd be cool to have the flight again..
<UxieLover1994> 13Because of the new game
<Cynder7> 6Ah.
<UxieLover1994> 13That's why
<Cynder7> 6Was the story going to be all the TLoS?
<UxieLover1994> 13I think so
<DSD> 4Yes
<DSD> 4I think it was going to be all of the games in one
<Cynder7> 6I wonder what extra stuff they'd put in the story..I mean,even if you put all the cutscenes together and some fighting stuff,it still won't be much..
<UxieLover1994> 13If I could, I would make a small show with the classic Spyro characters for YouTube use. Maybe Activison would hire us to put it on TV and keep the fans, while they continue with the new game
<DSD> 4It would make about a hour long film
<UxieLover1994> 13Also, a comic book on the classic games would do, as well
<Cynder7> 6That'd be fun :3
<UxieLover1994> 13I've got ideas that could be possible if we had permission and money...
*DSD 4thinks a story about Red before Spyro would be nice
<Cynder7> 6Oh yeah..iFail..I was thinking more about the scenes of TEN and didn't think much of the time of the others..
<UxieLover1994> 13You mean a prequel to AHT?
<DSD> 4Yea theres maybe about an hour in each game
<DSD> 4Yes
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..
<Cynder7> 6Aaah,Red's awesome..
<DSD> 4I want to know more about red from his point of view
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay! We should also have a side-story on some of Spyro's friends, such as Bentley or Sgt. Byrd
<DSD> 4Right
<UxieLover1994> 13Yeah, I also wish I could se how Red became evil
*DSD 4wonders if Uxie is really going to do this
<DSD> 4If you are count me in.
<UxieLover1994> 13I could draft the stories. Once I've written about five, we'll get to the next step: animate it
<UxieLover1994> 13I would be voicing Bianca, Elora, Greta and maybe some CotDs
<Cynder7> 6CotD?
<UxieLover1994> 13Who would you voice?
<UxieLover1994> 13Character of the Day
<Cynder7> 6AH
<Cynder7> 6*Ah
<UxieLover1994> 13Negitive comments are getting worse!
<Cynder7> 6D:
<DSD> 4D:
<Cynder7> 6Just a few more months till they're all proven wrong!
<DSD> 4 4months
<Cynder7> 6Guess we'll have to wait till then.. ._.
<DSD> 4I wish there was a dragon news site
<DSD> 4That hosted Stuff about Spyro
<DSD> 4like the game fan art work
<UxieLover1994> 13Yeah, but until the game's released, it will be four months of negitive comments and anti-Spyro bullying
<Cynder7> 6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADnZrhFAmm4&feature=channel_video_title :3

<Aurora> cuz it's gonna take a lot more than just walking in
<UxieLover1994> 13Thanks! :)
<eXAKR> Ich.
<eXAKR> Do get it seen as soon as possible
<eXAKR> I'm worried about that
<Aurora> 6I know lol
<eXAKR> It might be something serious ><
<Aurora> 6everyone is saying the same thing
<Aurora> 6parents mentioned tonsils might need to be removed
<Aurora> 6which is fine by me, I've lost 7 pounds in a week and a half
<Aurora> 6because it takes me an hour to eat a meal that should take 10 minutes
<eXAKR> Wow, that must be painful
<eXAKR> Could it be infected tonsils?
<eXAKR> Then again, you could be in a lot of pain if it was that
<Aurora> 6yeah it doesn't hurt
<eXAKR> http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003115.htm
<Dark_Shadow_dragon> 4:)
<Aurora> 6add this to my long list of problems lololol
<eXAKR> Allergies eep
<eXAKR> I think I might be starting to become allergic to mint
<Aurora> 6allergies, temp low blood sugar, a heart that decides to have random spaz moments
<eXAKR> I can't use any mint-cooling shower foam without feeling tight afterwards
<eXAKR> And a heart that spazzes?
<eXAKR> No good
<Aurora> 6nope
<eXAKR> Well, for me I have my teeth and my disgestive system messing with me all the time
<eXAKR> Now it's constipated ><
<eXAKR> Oh yeah, and skin problems as well
<eXAKR> eczema, dry cracking hands, etc.

<Aurora> 6it's so random that it would be nearly impossible for doctors to monitor
<Aurora> 6without having something on me 24/7
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> Could be related to your swallowing
<eXAKR> Might be your nervous system spazzing, or something
<Aurora> 6nah
<eXAKR> Tell your doctor about it,
<Aurora> 6my heart's done this for a couple years
<Aurora> 6swallowing is recent
<eXAKR> When did the heart problem start? And how?
<Aurora> 6like i said
<Aurora> 6I don't know
<Aurora> 6heck for all I know, it's not the heart itself
<Aurora> 6it basically feels like a muscle twitch
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> Maybe a chest x-ray or something might reveal something

<eXAKR> And Roara, you still there?

<Mikey> I WISH I was playing pokemon stadium 2 but there's a bee in the house
<RedDragonX> yah
<SilverSonic> Cruz's song sucks
<Mikey> so I fled to the back and I'm stuck here til my mom gets home
<Lambda> D:
<Icydragon> 12Imposter!?!?!
<prince-dari> Nah, he's a hallucination.
<Mikey> because FUCKING DOUCHEBAG DOWNSTAIRS left the sliders wide open last night and let a shit ton of bugs in the house
<prince-dari> We worked this out ages ago.
<Mikey> last night there were flies everywhere
<Mikey> he was like LOL OH I WAS JUST STANDING ON THE DECK FOR A FEW MINUTES
<Mikey> WELL is it THAT FUCKING HARD TO SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND YOU
<prince-dari> The real RDX went to work for Pepsi and couldn't come back because he was so ashamed.
<RedDragonX> yep
*prince-dari trololololololo
<Light_Latias> lol
<RedDragonX> what he said
<Mikey> I still wouldn't even care if there was still a fly or two in the house but NO I am not dealing with bees
<Ghosties> 4Wait, how do we create a fixed room with a password?
<prince-dari> Are you alergic to bees?
<Mikey> no.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think we have to register it somehow
<Mikey> but I'm not taking the chances of getting stung
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can ask DCD when he gets in here
<prince-dari> Lawl.
*Light_Latias hmms
<Mikey> hell, I might be, I don't know because I've never been stung.
<prince-dari> I don't get why people are so scared of them, they don't sting you if you don't bother them.
<Icydragon> 12D:
<Light_Latias> the new Raving Rabbids looks interesting <late>
<SilverSonic> I'm losing faith with Ubisoft )=
<Icydragon> 12I thought it was coke?
<RedDragonX> it is lol
<Mikey> well it freaks me out to even see them and you all know how extra wimpy I am about EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE
<RedDragonX> he's just screwing with you
<prince-dari> You are? O_o
<Mikey> in 4th grade I was afraid of the sky and being open near the sky with nothing to hang on in case I got sucked up into the atmosphere
<Ghosties> 4True
<Mikey> go ahead laugh
<Light_Latias> lol
<prince-dari> Sounds pretty cool.

<Ghosties> 4Yeah?
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kpowqoR2Wn1qzma4ho1_400.jpg
<TheRunningDCD> and because of it I wasn't going to be able to stream this past Friday?
<TheRunningDCD> it got postponed. AGAIN
<Ghosties> 4Man
<Hipster_Brony> 8lolwut
<TheRunningDCD> either for next Monday or next Friday.
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats awesome tho
<TheRunningDCD> that means I will be able to stream Friday
<Ghosties> 4That test just ain't ever gonna get taken :'( Poor test
<TheRunningDCD> so no problems there
<TheRunningDCD> that brings me to our next point
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have never had a test get postponed twice
<SkyRyd3r> Me?
<SkyRyd3r> I've been
<SkyRyd3r> Somewhere
<TheRunningDCD> actually I think the professor just didn't communicate well and she meant it would't be either of these Saturdays
<TheRunningDCD> but still
<TheRunningDCD> I'm available this Friday
<Hipster_Brony> 8continue...
<TheRunningDCD> anyways
<TheRunningDCD> BronyState Intermission is going to occur before the Mario movie, since it's our B-Movie
<SkyRyd3r> Somewhere North
<SkyRyd3r> o-o
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, so after the 1st pony episode?
<drf-Droid> oh isn't that ironic
<TheRunningDCD> if I can put the finishing touches on the Ace Combat Squad
<TheRunningDCD> that will be this Friday
<TheRunningDCD> if not
<Silverscreen> I'm using mIRC, so I won't be changing the color of my text.
<drf-Droid> I'm going like twice the speed limit to get here in a hurry
<Ghosties> 4Speaking of which, what do you think of Assault Horizon, DCD?
<drf-Droid> and my sister isn't even ready
<May> 14Well, you should stay here
<May> 14more
<May> 14okay
<May> 14you canadian
<Guest5239104> I need to talk to my damn internet provider. That's the third time today my internet stopped working.
<TheRunningDCD> I'll try to fight Astray man-to-man in Blazblue, since I noticed Ragna has color palettes I like to call "Rarity Ragna", "Applejack Ragna", and "Pinkie Pie Ragna"
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver is getting trolled by the internet
<TheRunningDCD> and I main him so yeah
<Ghosties> 4DCD, what did you think of Assault Horizon; the new Ace Combat?
<TheRunningDCD> also Ghosties: Project Aces hasn't made a _bad_ game yet, so I think that will probably be the case. Whether it's a good entry to the AC Franchise, we'll see when it's out
<Guest5239104> And for some reason the chat in Bronystate kept resetting on me.
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Quanyails> 7MAY
<Quanyails> 7*late*
<Ghosties> 4I dunno...I don't like the new direction for the series with this game.
<Ghosties> 4It feels way too much like Call of Duty BUT WITH FIGHTER PLANES!!11
<TheRunningDCD> that's not necessarily a bad thing, if handled right
<TheRunningDCD> I mean
<TheRunningDCD> so long as they don't change the _atmosphere_ of the game
<TheRunningDCD> as in, the moody music
<TheRunningDCD> and the inmersion
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi sprinkles
<May> 14QUAN
<Ghosties> 4The music is almost always good
<May> 14HI
<TheRunningDCD> it always is
<Ghosties> 4As well as the immersion
<Quanyails> 7How've you been?
<May> 14okay
<May> 14Sheena
<May> 14just
<TheRunningDCD> I just mean the whole ambient I guess
<Silverscreen> Hey, sprinkles.
<Ghosties> 4But I really liked the world they had with the older games
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey guys
<SheenaFox> o3o
<May> 14just
<SheenaFox> just
<May> 14whyyyy
<SheenaFox> what
<drf-Droid> EW THAT FACE
<SheenaFox> what happened? XD
<SheenaFox> o3o
<drf-Droid> EW THAT FACE
<Ghosties> 4It felt almost magical, or anime-ish but with a military spin on it
<May> 14the existance of das boot
<SheenaFox> o3o
<TheRunningDCD> oh, Strangereal?
<Ghosties> 4Now, it just feels realistic *shrugs*
<drf-Droid> EW THAT FACE
<TheRunningDCD> I'm not too worried about that
<TheRunningDCD> because of Joint Assault
<SirSprinkles> 6Using friend's comp, so typing is kind of screwed up.
<TheRunningDCD> which takes place in the real world
<Ray||Homework> 02Angel_Espeon, Your Forum Signature
<SheenaFox> I still don't understand that commercial o3o
<May> 14just
<Hipster_Brony> 8wait a minute, why did "the official wingboner thread" get stickied on /oat/?
<drf-Droid> why are you trying to get me to press my up arrow? yes my phone has one
<May> 14its just
<Ray||Homework> 02CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN <3 ~
<May> 14just
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<SheenaFox> CHEN?! O3O
<drf-Droid> EW THAT FACE
<TheRunningDCD> also keep in mind that that's why I'm not too worried is because the Real World games are not numbered
<Ghosties> 4I never played Joint Assault...I just hope that the old canon isn't tossed away
<drf-Droid> ...LOL, You Spin Me Round is on the radio
<SirSprinkles> 6I miss anything?
<SheenaFox> lol o3o
<Ghosties> 4Right, I hope that at some point we'll see Ace Combat VII
<drf-Droid> YOU SPIN ME ROUND LIKE A RECORD BABY
<Ghosties> 4Not really Sprinkles
<Steve> 12 Hello, Aristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Silverscreen> They're talkking about video games right now.
<SirSprinkles> 6Cool.
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's one of the many Touhou banners I made out of boredom one night |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've got like 16 others
<drf-Droid> ALL I KNOW IS THAT TO ME, YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR LOTS OF FUN
<drf-Droid> er youre
<TheRunningDCD> so I think they might go Numbered Games: Strangereal; Subtitle only: RW
<drf-Droid> '
<SheenaFox> Well it's Touhou, so it's cool o3o
<Silverscreen> Sorry in advance if I sound a bit like a douche. My good monday slowly went sour.
<drf-Droid> EW THAT FACE
<SirSprinkles> 6I passed out, Silver. Do I win the bad Monday competition?
<Ghosties> 4Don't worry about Silver
<Ghosties> 4And DCD, I hope you're right
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol drf, you're starting to sound like a broken record o3o
<Jerry> May!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Jerry glomps a May
<Hipster_Brony> 8i had a great monday, up until one specific moment
<Jerry> Long time no seey!!!
<Jerry> see*
<drf-Droid> so are you with that face
<Jerry> and
<Jerry> DRF
*Jerry glomps a drf
<Ghosties> 4Eh, I'm having a bleh Monday
<Jerry> drf, have you heard that iOS5 their copying android's notification thingy
*Jerry waits for drf to rage
<drf-Droid> nope
<Hipster_Brony> 8my boss told me i was the best intern they have ever had at the football program and gave me a polo that only the coaches have
<SheenaFox> hi Angel o3o
<drf-Droid> implying I actually care what apple is stealing this time
<Jerry> o.o okays
<drf-Droid> they've been at it since the 80s, nothing new
<Silverscreen> awesome.
<Jerry> I'd never expect them to steal other people's ideas
<Ghosties> 4That's awesome, Hip!
<Hipster_Brony> 8then when i was riding my bike home from the stadium, it fell off my shoulder and got caught in the spokes
<Silverscreen> Yikes.
<Ghosties> 4The Polo didn't get ripped, did it?
<SirSprinkles> 6Ouch.
<SirSprinkles> 6...wow, Ghosties. XD
<TheRunningDCD> same here. Well, my days tend to get screwed when my mom pops up and starts getting annoying, but whatever
<TheRunningDCD> in any case
<Hipster_Brony> 8no, its super sturdy, but it has rubber all over it
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Sheena xD /late
<TheRunningDCD> I wish to know what's the situation with TurniBrony
<Hipster_Brony> 8from the tire
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<SheenaFox> XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8ill take it
<Hipster_Brony> 8he has been paraspriting the shit out of our threads
<junh1024-XD> everyone steals from everyone else
<drf-Droid> Jerry, watch Pirates of Silicon Valley
<junh1024-XD> get over it
<drf-Droid> yeah
<Ghosties> 4o.o wut Sprinkles?
<Hipster_Brony> 8he constantly complains about the movies, called us soft and implied we were corrupt
<TheRunningDCD> pour example?
<TheRunningDCD> oh right
<TheRunningDCD> that guy
<Jerry> o.o whats that
<TheRunningDCD> well
<HyperMetalLugia> I loved that movie :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Nothing, Ghosties.
<drf-Droid> a movie
<Ghosties> 4Corrupt? Is he too spouting INJUSTICE
<drf-Droid> yeah
<TheRunningDCD> I'd say we better let him continue instead of downright banning him
<drf-Droid> OK, bbl
<TheRunningDCD> for the following reasons:
<Hipster_Brony> 8im not going to ban him yet
<Ghosties> 4o.O
<TheRunningDCD> a) We have no control over Ponychan, and he'd continue posting and paraspritin' even worse.
<Hipster_Brony> 8but i told him that he needs to stop with his constant criticism
<Hipster_Brony> 8if he does that, i will report him
<TheRunningDCD> b) He might start going around saying shit about us that could make us lose viewers.
<TheRunningDCD> c) He's basically harmless
<Hipster_Brony> 8he literally does nothing on the thread but complain about the movies and criticize the mods
<TheRunningDCD> Let the Chihuahua yip
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, i agree
<TheRunningDCD> we should just give him a stern talking to, I'll take care of that
<TheRunningDCD> that way people WILL see that this is just some obnoxious fuck
<Hipster_Brony> 8hes harmless, but i hate that he messes with the the thread every week
<SkyRyd3r> <May> 14you canadian <-- Yes, I is Canadian.
<SkyRyd3r> :)
<TheRunningDCD> but if we were to ban him for that, we'd be basically giving the unarmed man a rocket launcher
<Ghosties> 4I still think he has some valid points
<Ray||Homework> 02<Angel_Espeon> 13it's one of the many Touhou banners I made out of boredom one night |D
<Ray||Homework> 02<Angel_Espeon> 13I've got like 16 others <-- Give me the Flandre one.... I know that you made one. plz?
<HSX> 04Sky :D
<Jerry> drf: kay, I'll check it out
<SirSprinkles> 6It's the way he expresses those points that's the problem.
<Ghosties> 4Or rather, I appreciate his interest in difference of opinion when it comes to films; the guy likes Videodrome, after all
<Ghosties> 4But yeah, he's getting to the point that he bitches and moans
<Hipster_Brony> 8i agree with some of the points, but he is an asshole about most of them
<May> 14lol anyways
<May> 14I'm addicted
<May> 14to this stupid commercial
<Angel_Espeon> 13http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t190/xxHarmonyAngelxx/flandrebanner1.png
<TheRunningDCD> let him keep bitchin' and moanin' until HE truly gets out of hand, so people realize he brought this upon himself
<Silverscreen> I don't mind the criticism, ghosties. It's that he doesn't give them as opinions, he expresses them by bitching at us. Not to mention that he's also paraspriting the mods.
<TheRunningDCD> like which points?
<TheRunningDCD> also
<SirSprinkles> 6I agree with some aswell, which is why I suggested the live streaming of the picks to rule out pressure.
<May> 14omg
<May> 14no
<May> 14i want that
<TheRunningDCD> don't some of the Color Schemes look like certain ponies to you? http://www.giantbomb.com/blazblue-continuum-shift/61-28321/all-images/52-371507/ragnacolorchart/51-1548200/
*Ray||Homework hugs Angel Tightly
<Ray||Homework> 02Thx~
<Ray||Homework> 02In reward
<TheRunningDCD> if the Intermission is by playing Blazblue
<TheRunningDCD> which should I pick?
<TheRunningDCD> AJ Ragna, Rarity Ragna, or Pinkie Ragna?
<Ghosties> 4Right Sprinkles. And DCD, I said I just appreciated his difference of opinion. He's not afraid to speak up, I like that. But his opinion is becoming obnoxious now. He's been moaning about the BMN for the past two weeks
<SirSprinkles> 6Rarity
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've got a banner of Yukari, Kaguya, Utsuho, Remilia, Sakuya, Satori, Suwako, Yuyuko, Aya, Flandre, Koishi, Nazrin, Chen, Sanae, and two of Reimu
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<May> 14can I have a Remilia one?
<Ghosties> 4AJ Ragna
<Ghosties> 4Honestly, DCD should just play as Taokaka. She's the best character anyways
<Hipster_Brony> 8dcd, he made points about how we were basically getting the same kinds of movies every week because people felt pressured to pick ones that everyone would like instead of what they liked
<Angel_Espeon> 13http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t190/xxHarmonyAngelxx/remiliabanner.png
<Silverscreen> A point we've constantly went against when people got to choose their movie.
<TheRunningDCD> which we really can't do anything against
<Silverscreen> hell, the rolling guarenteed that didn't happen.
<Ghosties> 4And he's kinda right, too. But that's why we're doing the voice only command during the live stream and picking the winners during the BMN
<TheRunningDCD> Voice-Only Command?
<Angel_Espeon> 13the Remilia banner is one of my least favourites, actually |D I might try to make a better one the next time I'm hit with boredom
<TheRunningDCD> oh
<TheRunningDCD> OH
<TheRunningDCD> I see what you mean
<Silverscreen> The mute setting
<TheRunningDCD> however
<Creideiki> Hello everyone.
<TheRunningDCD> there IS a problem
<Ghosties> 4?
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, it's something we have talked about
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Creideiki :3
<TheRunningDCD> only Registered Nicks can be given voice
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i thought of this today
<TheRunningDCD> or at least I think so
<Silverscreen> nope.,
<SirSprinkles> 6I used my unregistered secondary yesterday.
<TheRunningDCD> that sounds like a good idea
<Silverscreen> We tested it with an unregistered nick yesterday.
<Silverscreen> Only Mods need to be registered.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we already have kind of a problem with people in europe not being available for the selection because of the time change
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, we should be fine with people picking their choice during the stream
<Hipster_Brony> 8it's going to be that much worse if we do it after the stream
<SirSprinkles> 6How about around a half hour before?
<Ghosties> 4Luckily, we got dari for a mod and he's a Brit brony
<Silverscreen> but half of the eurobros aren't even awake for the event.
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Hipster_Brony> 8we're trying to change that though
<Jerry> Creideiki!
<Jerry> hai :3 long time no see
<Creideiki> Hiya
<Hipster_Brony> 8unfortunately, dari just went to sleep
<Ghosties> 4We could do the drawing live during the preshow
<TheRunningDCD> nah we should do it
<TheRunningDCD> between movies
<TheRunningDCD> as in
<Hipster_Brony> 8but he said he knows how to stream
<Creideiki> A bit of my awesome nerd awesomeness was rather... damaged the other day.
<TheRunningDCD> during the Intermission Period
<Hipster_Brony> 8he could be our european streamer
<Silverscreen> I have a question.
<Armageddon> p+p
<Armageddon> o-o
<Ghosties> 4Eh, if you think it would be best. But yes, Dari could be our euro streamer
<Silverscreen> Other than the minor confusion, what was wrong with rolling for the movies?
<TheRunningDCD> yeah
<TheRunningDCD> Brony Movie Night East is a thing I've wanted for it to happen for a while
<Silverscreen> I mean, the only reason why we changed it is because our threads were moved to /chat/
<Silverscreen> but now that it's back in /oat/ we could simply make it another roll game.
<Quanyails> 7Porque?
<Ghosties> 4Rolling was an absolute mess though. Everyone was trying to roll for trips and it was generally a push and shove contest
<Novi> mrewwwo
<TheRunningDCD> but Roll Game has the same problems
<TheRunningDCD> not to mention that now that I know how to GET
<TheRunningDCD> I would be getting Trips all day erryday
<Creideiki> My KSR-33 Teletype has become a massive write-off...
<Creideiki> And slightly biohazardous.
<SirSprinkles> 6Roll game just wasn't the greatest plan there was.
<SirSprinkles> 6New system is 20x better.
<SirSprinkles> 6IMO
<Silverscreen> SIrSprinkles: Sans the whole corruption and suggestion thing.
<stefan> Aristeo:
<stefan> Aristeo:
<stefan> Aristeo:
<SirSprinkles> 6Hence why we'd be doing it during the stream now.
<stefan> I need you
<Aristeo> o.o
<stefan> where are you?
<Aristeo> kk
<stefan> Ok
<Aristeo> o/
<stefan> well
<stefan> everything has gone to chaos on my server
<SirSprinkles> 6Every system has kinks to work out initially.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if people accusing us of corruption becomes an issue, i will screencap the thing i use for it and post
<Ghosties> 4Exactly, this way we can get rid of the whole "bias" bs
<TheRunningDCD> okay people
<TheRunningDCD> the question is this
<Silverscreen> IMO, I think we should do it on Saturday if we want to do it in the chat. This'll give everypony a good time to get on since Saturday is usually a slow day, and it won't take away from the stream.
<TheRunningDCD> when should we make the Roll?
<Ghosties> 4By way of streaming the drawing live we can finally get rid of all the corruption calling
<Ghosties> 4Roll?
<Aristeo> Jason?
<TheRunningDCD> during Intermission, Preshow, or at the end of all of the menu?
<TheRunningDCD> well
<TheRunningDCD> not roll
<TheRunningDCD> the drawing, then
<Ghosties> 4You mean the draw?
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, here's the thing
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would want to do it at the end to give people an incentive not to leave early
<Hipster_Brony> 8but
<Hipster_Brony> 8most of the eurobronies wouldn't be able to stay up that late
<SirSprinkles> 6Saturday just seems like a lot of setup for such a little thing. I think we should do it afterwards or during intermission since we're already set up, and again, incentive not to leave early.
<TheRunningDCD> Intermission show, then
<Lambda> Alright Sony
<Lambda> convince me to buy a PS3
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Hipster_Brony> 8here's what we should do then
<Ghosties> 4So, we do the drawing during the intermission. Sounds good
<Hipster_Brony> 8on friday, i'll put up a thread on /oat/ to enter
<Lambda> XD
<Silverscreen> So when does the thread go up?
<Silverscreen> oh.
<Hipster_Brony> 8friday morning that is
<Hipster_Brony> 8and we can let people know during pre-show and during the pre-movie announcements
<Silverscreen> I just thought of something.
<Lambda> "Now my editor friends tell me nothing makes their day like a controversy. My answer to them: You're welcome"
<Lambda> in regards to the PSN incident
<TheRunningDCD> also
<Silverscreen> If TurniBrony ever wants to give his choice of movie, he'd have to watch some of the show if we continue to use this.
<TheRunningDCD> better make sure Seth posts the Brony Movie Night news on Friday
<Lambda> now he's apologizing to everyone else
<Hipster_Brony> 8for sure DCD
<Lambda> :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8i'll make sure to ask him to post on friday
<Ghosties> 4That's a good point, Silver. Turni would actually have to show up
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver: trollface.jpg
<Ghosties> 4Do you think Turni would finally stop complaining if he won a drawing?
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope.avi
<Silverscreen> nope.avi
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://cdn3.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/098/410/original/1297321717120.gif?1297327490
<Ghosties> 4COMBO BREAKER
<Ghosties> 4dammit, hip >_<
<Hipster_Brony> 8u mad?
<Silverscreen> Hipster: How about I web your shit?
<Ghosties> 4i ain't even mad
<Ray> 02o-o
<SirSprinkles> 6How are we doing with the listserv, btw, since I've been noticing a lot of people coming in a day or two late that I guess can't READ that it's on a Friday, not to mention all the people that show up immediately after the showing thinking it's just about to start.
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/meh.ro6205.jpg
<TheRunningDCD> >just saw the Luna toy
<TheRunningDCD> THE HORROR
<Silverscreen> THERE'S A LUNA TOY?! o.o
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh god, even our chat isnt safe from a spiderman derail
<Hipster_Brony> 8the hasbro toys suck massively
<SirSprinkles> 6If you can call it that, Silver.
<Ghosties> 4That picture...*shudder*
<Hipster_Brony> 8celestia is always pink for some reason
<Ghosties> 4Those proportions ARE NOT RIGHT
<SirSprinkles> 6God I hate this keyboard... >>;
<stefan> Aristeo: You there?>
<Silverscreen> Yeah, I heard that, for some reason, Pinkie comes with a fucking bunny instead of Gummy.
<Aristeo> I'm here
<Aristeo> Your server is okay
<Jason> Yeah, I know
<Ghosties> 4KITTY GOES ON BACK
<TheRunningDCD> Hipster some are pretty decent
<Ghosties> 4You mean those toys?
<Jason> just no ports are binding
<TheRunningDCD> the AJ toy is pretty okay
<TheRunningDCD> but this
<TheRunningDCD> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/5825b745be2902d374bc8e4c4423e2df/20681%20-%20celestia%20luna%20toy.png
<Jason> and its all messed up
<TheRunningDCD> is pretty OH GOD WHAT
<Ghosties> 4Like Twilight has a cat
<Aristeo> Looks okay to me
*SirSprinkles 6has Pinkie. Disappoint that no Gummy.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, those are the ones. Twilight has a cat, and Dash has the turtle
<Jason> try to run: /home/stefan/inspircd/inspircd
<Jason> run it
<Silverscreen> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmabalWDIv1qcoci5.jpg
<Silverscreen> .....
<Silverscreen> yeah, no.
<Hipster_Brony> 8the custom stuff is always much more well done though
<Hipster_Brony> 8like this: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e0aUHfpu9dY/Te08g8kR8dI/AAAAAAAAFhE/GmgHA-ufw3A/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> 8pink celestia: do not want
<SirSprinkles> 6So, again, where do we stand on the listserv?
<Ghosties> 4...Why is Luna one of the previous gens and Celestia a re-color?
<TheRunningDCD> also
<Silverscreen> No idea where we are with the listserv.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, [spiderman i dunno lol pic]
<TheRunningDCD> the admin for the channel I mentioned, Hipster, is on now
<TheRunningDCD> how about I talk to her aboot this?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i still think we should try and run this one though, it would be smaller and a little more "intimate" for lack of a better word
<Hipster_Brony> 8people would know each other more
<Silverscreen> We don't outsource. :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8it would be a lot of people that come to movie night, so people would get the joke when we post a pic of a flute
<Hipster_Brony> 8stuff like that
<TheRunningDCD> it definitely won't be "smaller"
<Ghosties> 4The listserv is sending emails and notifications to other people, right?
<TheRunningDCD> considering this gets like 200 visitors
<Silverscreen> Ghosties: Yes.
<stefan> yeah
<TheRunningDCD> the other gets like 80 on a good day
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, Ghosties.
<stefan> Im here
<stefan> sorry, did I time out again?
<TheRunningDCD> still feels kinda dickish
<Hipster_Brony> 8i doubt we will get 200 people for regular chat though
<TheRunningDCD> this is kind of their turf
<Ghosties> 4Ah, okay ^_^
<TheRunningDCD> so yeah
<Silverscreen> wait, what?
<Hipster_Brony> 8whats wrong with having multiple pony chat sites?
<Silverscreen> Are we talking about moving to a different server or something?
<Ghosties> 4Are we doing another channel?
<Hipster_Brony> 8no
<SkyRyd3r> Hey HSX :)
<Hipster_Brony> 8well
<Hipster_Brony> 8kind of
<Hipster_Brony> 8so we brought up using this site as general chat last night
<Silverscreen> Right.
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD is saying we should basically merge chat with the IRCHighway channel for my little pony
<TheRunningDCD> at least for the GENERAL chat
<Silverscreen> yeah, how about no?
<Hipster_Brony> 8so we wouldnt be hosting it
<TheRunningDCD> this would still be the movie night chat
<Silverscreen> We're already catching shit from 4chan and the like for invading them with ponies.
<TheRunningDCD> but otherwise, the General Chat would stay in the General chat
<Hipster_Brony> 8no no
<Ascendant> o-o
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver
<Hipster_Brony> 8this is the MLP dedicated channel on IRC
<Ascendant> wat
<Hipster_Brony> 8we wouldnt be invading anyone
<TheRunningDCD> the channel that, incidentally, I am a regular on
<Ghosties> 4All it would take is for some wiseguy to leak it to 4chan
<Ghosties> 4And oh boy
<Ghosties> 4You wanna talk about a shit storm
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats what mods are for
<TheRunningDCD> fun fact: #mylittlepony is known to 4chan, they just don't visit it
<Ghosties> 4I think we'd be pressing our luck, but hey, maybe it'll work
<TheRunningDCD> it was mentioned in today's general thread, actually
<Hipster_Brony> 8but i do want to use this site for chat
<Hipster_Brony> 8outside of the general movie night that is
<TheRunningDCD> how about this? I'll tell her about this, and ask her to come here
<Ghosties> 4As I've mentioned before, I wouldn't be able to moderate the chat all the time.
<TheRunningDCD> if the case is that, I'll add another widget to the site
<Ghosties> 4That's asking for a lot
<SirSprinkles> 6Though it will take a while to get this site up and running for that purpose, Hipster.
<TheRunningDCD> linking to that channel
<TheRunningDCD> which can be used as general chat
<Silverscreen> We don't neccisarily need the site for this, Sprinkles.

<Silverscreen> The site is merely to host the Movie Night event.
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, we basically have moddig covered except for like 3-9am
<Hipster_Brony> 8if i remember correctly
<NightSeas> 12:P
<SirSprinkles> 6But some shifts only have one mod.
<SirSprinkles> 6What if they can't do a day.
<Silverscreen> Right. I'm always up and on by 9 in the morning.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we need to recruit more mods anyway
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can check with dari next time he is on
<HSX> 04Anyone remember me being disappointed by the Pandora?
<Ghosties> 4Do you guys think we'll need more mods for a general chat?
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz he can mod overnight stuff since he's in england
<HSX> 04I TAKE THAT BACK.
<HSX> 04The device runs my games so smooth.
<HSX> 04:'D
<Hipster_Brony> 8probably one or 2 at least
<HyperMetalLugia> How expensive is it o.o
<Ray> 02O-o
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Silverscreen> Ghosties: Only for when we aren't available.
<Quanyails> 7What's this Pandora I've been hearing?
<May> 14fangirl script works again
<HyperMetalLugia> !fangirl
<May> JAPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
<HyperMetalLugia> <3
<HyperMetalLugia> !fangirl
<May> EXCALIBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR!
<HyperMetalLugia> !fangirl
<May> FLANDREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
<HyperMetalLugia> Boo
<May> 14boo you
<Light_Latias> May oxo
<Light_Latias> hai
<Quanyails> 7Ooh, that script!
<Quanyails> 7I miss it. :3
<Quilava> squeak.
<Quanyails> 7!fangirl
<May> HIBARIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here :3
<Quanyails> 7Ah, nope.
<Quanyails> 7!fangirl
<May> PRUSSIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
<SheenaFox> w00t prussia
<SheenaFox> wow Aero
<AeroDracohem> haythar
<Ghosties> 4*shrugs* At least we have dari over the in the UK like Hip said. He can mod for when we're asleep. Finding mods that can help us with the workload would be advantageous...but where are we gonna find mods that actually WANT to mod the chat? We were lucky to find Sprinkles
<SheenaFox> you just missed flandre
<Light_Latias> Aero too
<Quanyails> 7Question: What's 3:00 PDT in EST time?
<RedDragonX> PS3 is great if you want a blueray player and a good gaming machine all in one
<Light_Latias> laaa
<SirSprinkles> 6:p
<AeroDracohem> FLANDRE?
<AeroDracohem> D':
<May> 14uhm
<May> 14PDT?
<Lambda> yes, but I don't see the point in buying it when it hardly has any good games that I can't already play
<May> 14Whats that?
<Quanyails> 7Pacific.
<Lambda> the uncharted series is really it for me
<SheenaFox> pacific daylight time
<May> 14oh
<May> 145 PM maybe
<Quanyails> 7Okay. o3o
<RedDragonX> well then if you are an abscent gamer don't invest in such things
<RedDragonX> Personally I got it for GTA4
<HyperMetalLugia> I thought it was +3 hrs o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Odd
<RedDragonX> and a few good games after that
<Lambda> yeah, I could play that on my 360
<RedDragonX> and I'll need it for KH3
<Lambda> KH3 is coming out?
<May> 14I don't know
<Lambda> I need to finish the first two yet
<May> 14I don't normally check what time it is in New York
<RedDragonX> not for awhile
<RedDragonX> it's not even announced yet
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, hopefully we will get Bristle back soon
<HyperMetalLugia> I normally check almost every timezone xD
<Lambda> good, I have time :P
<RedDragonX> they can't start work on it until they're done with Final Fantasy whatever number they're on
<May> 14I pay attention only to Aussie time
<Lambda> 13-2
<May> 14normally
<Lambda> a sequel to a sequel
<RedDragonX> yeah whatever it is
<Lambda> XD
<RedDragonX> eh
<Hipster_Brony> 8i've been keeping an eye out for potential new half-ops too
<Silverscreen> We're doing good so far, with 200 bronies in the room and the turbo chat only appearing now and then, and in the past five weeks we've only had a total of 8 bans. so starting the chat off wouldn't be too difficult. As we watch the chat, we can keep an eye out for other potential mods. It'll be easier to spot them when they're on for more than eight hours for one night.
<RedDragonX> until then they'll release Dream, Drop, Distance on 3DS to bridge the gap
<SirSprinkles> 6lawls
<RedDragonX> still gonne be about 3 or 4 years though
<Lambda> I'd like a 3DS, but not until it either drops in price or more games come out
<Lambda> as of right now I'm only really interested in the Ocarina of Time remake
<RedDragonX> Well I never got a DS so I just got the 3DS so that I could run both
<Ray> 02HML, what time is over hereee~ ?
<Lambda> ah, that's good thinking
<SirSprinkles> 6Once we cover that odd morning shift it shouldn't be a huge issue.
<RedDragonX> I got Pokemon Soul Silver and Platinum to go with it
<Lambda> I should've done that actually
<Lambda> I got my DS first last year
<RedDragonX> and KH ReCoded
<HyperMetalLugia> -1:30 from here
<HyperMetalLugia> So 8:18pm?
<HyperMetalLugia> Roughly
<Ghosties> 4So you're saying we could monitor the general chat for potential recruits...yes
<Silverscreen> exactly. And that morning shift is basically just for the Eurobronies, seeing that just about everyone in the USA will be snoozing at that time.
<Lambda> oh, boo a sports game
<Lambda> no need for me to pay attention for a little while
<Lambda> :P
<Silverscreen> Yep.
<RedDragonX> what sport game?
<Hipster_Brony> 8and honestly, i think one or 2 mods can handle chat in here, we won't be getting 200 people just for general chat
<Lambda> NBA 2ksomething
<SkyRyd3r> Quanyails
<RedDragonX> oh
<RedDragonX> yeah I don't play those
<SkyRyd3r> Pacific is 3 hours behind Eastern
<RedDragonX> cept Madden once in awhile
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly if dari could cover that we'd be good. Though we won't be able to ask him for a while.
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Lambda> graphics look pretty amazing
<SkyRyd3r> So it would be 8:48 here, and 5:48 in Pacific
<May> 14six then
<Quanyails> 7So 6:00?
<SkyRyd3r> Since I'm in Eastern
<Hipster_Brony> 8its gonna be more like 30-50 at most i think
<Lambda> but sport games don't really intereest me
<Quanyails> 7Thank you, Sky.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah :P
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<SkyRyd3r> No problem :)
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari was just on earlier tonight
<RedDragonX> well
<Hipster_Brony> 8hes asleep now though
<RedDragonX> it's fun in a group
<Lambda> Hey Stormy
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo
<Ghosties> 4That's true, it would just be a place for people to hang out if they wanna discuss ponies. I honestly don't see it getting more people than the BMN
<RedDragonX> but by yourself it's boring
<SirSprinkles> 6So much for being away for a month.
<Ghosties> 4Like Hip said
<Silverscreen> A good point. There aren't that many people who are into IRC, so it's not like this place will be packed with them.
<Kyro> :P
<Stormy> Hey
<SkyRyd3r> Gahhhhh
<SkyRyd3r> Bored.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and you have to think, we get 200 people for movie night because it's pretty heavily publicized and it's on a specific night and time, with movies being shown
<May> 14draw
<Light_Latias> whee glitches
<SkyRyd3r> Say wha
<Hipster_Brony> 8with none of those things, fewer people will show up, and they will be spread throughout the week
<SkyRyd3r> I can't draw
<SkyRyd3r> I could never draw
<May> 14excuse me
<SirSprinkles> 6My only concern is if one of us needs a day off and it would leave the chat uncovered for a period of time... though my schedule is incredibly flexible if informed in advance.
<May> 14GO DRAW
<May> 14NOW
<SkyRyd3r> How can I draw if I can't draw
<SkyRyd3r> :P
<Ghosties> 4Also, if we find mods for the chat we could recruit them for the BMN. Then again, we may not need anymore mods for that
<RedDragonX> but yeah get to work on the first two or you will have no idea what's going on :P
*May is going to go to Canada and hunt you down
*SkyRyd3r blinks
<Hipster_Brony> 8we could use more half-ops i think
<Hipster_Brony> 8especially the way this is expanding
<Silverscreen> I think hipster is right.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we got 150 even with basically not having an EQD post
<May> 14well
<May> 14go write then
*Quanyails 7is slightly tired, and slightly satisfied with another fakemon. O_o
<SirSprinkles> 6I agree with Hipster.
<Silverscreen> Four full OPs, who are almost always available, pretty much covers that base.
<Quanyails> 7Even if it's a derpworm. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Can your next fakemon be a coffee mug?
<Hipster_Brony> 8in the question i put in the pinkie poll, 55% of people said they had hadn't come to BMN, but are interested
<HyperMetalLugia> Mugshot *shot*
<Quanyails> 7Ah, nah.
<Hipster_Brony> 8think about that
<Quanyails> 7I'll probably be revamping Taigar's details.
<Hipster_Brony> 8 55% of ponychan
<Ghosties> 4But let's remember, this is Summer. Everyone is mostly available for moderating. Fall will be a completely different story when school gets back into full swing
*SirSprinkles 6will probably still be available whenever in fall
<Silverscreen> That's why they'll only be half ops.
<Hipster_Brony> 8let's deal with fall when it comes
<Ghosties> 4But alright, let's give the general chat a test run
<Ghosties> 4I definitely wanna see how it'll turn out
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, we still have the issue of the un moderated morning
<Hipster_Brony> 8at least til we find out if dari can do it or not
<SirSprinkles> 6And with him being busy for a while, it may have to wait.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I guess we'll just wait for now
<Hipster_Brony> 8dcd, are you still here?
*Silverscreen went to the mods room, there are no mods. returns here.
<TheRunningDCD> so
<TheRunningDCD> we should basically start working on Movie Night East
<Silverscreen> We do a test run of using this for General Chat
<Silverscreen> We keep an eye out for other potential half-ops
<Silverscreen> And we start doing the drawing durring BMN's intermission.
<Ghosties> 4But we're not gonna do a test run until dari returns, yes?
<Jerry> QUAN
<Jerry> YAILS
<Jerry> LIEK HAI :D
<SirSprinkles> 6And we find out about the listserv
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes, the listserv is a must
<Silverscreen> Oh yeah, and the listserv.
*Jerry pokes a unactive chat
<SkyRyd3r> I can't write
<SkyRyd3r> How can I write when I can't write?
<Hipster_Brony> 8we need to get that figured out, because it will be a HUGE help
<Silverscreen> I think I brought this up last night, but couldn't we just use the Derpy Mail for listerv? That's what ARGH uses, isn't it?
<Bronypeanut> 13I'M
<Bronypeanut> 13HERE
<SirSprinkles> 6We could always just ask ARGH about it.
<Ghosties> 4Hi Peanut
<Silverscreen> Hi, Peanut.
*SkyRyd3r pokes May with a tablet pen
<SirSprinkles> 6...fashionably late, Peanut?
<Jerry> SkyRyd3r: there will be cake if you finish writing/drawing :D
*Jerry SHOT
<Hipster_Brony> 8fashinably afk more like it
<SirSprinkles> 6lawls, jk. Hey.
*May dies
<Bronypeanut> 13Yeah
<Bronypeanut> 13Sorry
<Bronypeanut> 13<3
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<May> 14you can't write
<May> 14you must be playing some cruel joke
<SirSprinkles> 6I was fashionably late. Showed up right before we got serious.
<May> 14I hate it
*Jerry revives May
<SirSprinkles> 6justthatawesome.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> 8or should i say "enjoyment I anticipated experiencing after performing said activity"
<Bronypeanut> 13I had some business to do IRL
<Bronypeanut> 13Graduation shit
<Hipster_Brony> 8no problem
<SkyRyd3r> May
<SkyRyd3r> Believe when I say
<SirSprinkles> 6Speaking of which, we basically done? I need to head out to get food before this store closes.
<SkyRyd3r> I suck at writing now
<SkyRyd3r> Art, I'm meh
<SkyRyd3r> But writing
<SkyRyd3r> I can't even write a paragraph without raging
<Hipster_Brony> 8go ahead sprinkles
<Silverscreen> Wal-mart's open all night. :P
<SkyRyd3r> Oh well, doing art now =\
<SirSprinkles> 6Wal-mart's too far to walk.
<SkyRyd3r> But it sucks
*May flails
<SkyRyd3r> So I'll rip it up once it's done
<SirSprinkles> 6My friend gave blood today, so we can't walk far.
<SkyRyd3r> :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, I'm gonna head out then. Later everypony.
<Silverscreen> That reminds me, I'm giving blood tomorrow. *sets alarm*
<Silverscreen> Bye, Sprinkles.
<Ghosties> 4See ya Sprinkles
<SirSprinkles> 6I was going to give blood. I'm horribly afraid of needles. I passed out. lulz
<SirSprinkles> 6And with that, I'm out.

<Hipster_Brony> 8bye sprinkles
<Hipster_Brony> 8im way too much of a pussy to give blood
<SkyRyd3r> Ugh, tablet </3
<SheenaFox|Afk> I'm going to wash down my dinner with butter, brb
<SkyRyd3r> This 6-year old piece of junk hates me
<SkyRyd3r> .....
<Ghosties> 4I don't like to give blood either
<SkyRyd3r> Sheena, you haven't changed a bit.
*SkyRyd3r runs
<AeroDracohem> das boot
<Ghosties> 4But I'm not afraid of needles
<SkyRyd3r> Oh noes

<SheenaFox|Afk> k brbfor REAL
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh
*SkyRyd3r puts Aero in the age-worn bunnysuit
<Silverscreen> This'll be the first time I actually gave blood, but that's because I used to be on medication.
*SkyRyd3r teehees

<Ghosties> 4I hope everything goes well for you Silver

<SkyRyd3r> Did you all forget about it!?
<SkyRyd3r> Wow
<Hipster_Brony> 8should i put the selection entry thread up on thursday instead to give people more time?
<SkyRyd3r> I feel so old
<SkyRyd3r> :S
<May> 14you are old
<May> 14hee
<Bronypeanut> 13Uh wait

<SkyRyd3r> x-100
<SkyRyd3r> :D
<Bronypeanut> 13I don't follow along with this stuff very well
<SkyRyd3r> Which would be a negative
<SkyRyd3r> ....
<May> 14this means you are a fetus
*May pets the fetus
<Ghosties> 4We're doing Young Frankenstein
<Ghosties> 4And
<Hipster_Brony> 8young frankenstein and super mario bros
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Silverscreen> What pony episodes? I forget.
<AeroBunneh> delishus fetus
<Hipster_Brony> 8you should watch the discussion and mod threads
<Hipster_Brony> 8over a barrel and party of one
<TheRunningDCD> okay guys
<May> 14you would say that
<TheRunningDCD> this might be what we will do
*SkyFetus kicks around
<TheRunningDCD> we will use this chat as a general chat, okay
<HyperMetalLugia> atr
<HyperMetalLugia> Wat
<Aeroslash> O.o;
*May hushes the fetus
<TheRunningDCD> but we will link the other channel in the topic, 'kay?
*AeroBunneh puts SkyFetus in a pickle jar
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew
<Silverscreen> What other channel?
<Hipster_Brony> 8...ok
<Hipster_Brony> 8why?
<May> 14are logic = no
<May> 14*our
<Armageddon> hi
<SkyFetus> We go waaaaaaaaay back
<SkyFetus> It's an old-
<SkyFetus> old-TSTer thing
<SkyFetus> :P
<SkyFetus> Goddarn my keyboard hates me
<TheRunningDCD> because the other channel is better for general chatting as well
<TheRunningDCD> plus, it's common courtesy
<Ghosties> 4But we're still using this as the BMN chat, yes?
<TheRunningDCD> nobody has to stick to a single IRC, after all
<TheRunningDCD> yeah
<TheRunningDCD> we are
<May> 14yeah
<May> 14very old
<May> 14like five years old
*May leaps across the room
<Ray> 02<SilverSonic> christ almight, how many bloody shooter games are being made x_x <-- Over 9000 FPS games
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, slightly off topic, but !!RainbowDash said he is probably going to come to a BMN eventually
<Ghosties> 4Oh, awesome
<Hipster_Brony> 8we wont know its him though, unfortunately
<Silverscreen> what other channel?
<Hipster_Brony> 8the IRCHighway one
<Ray> 02[/late]
<SkyFetus> I've been with TST since like...2005, back when lugia.co.uk was still young
<SkyFetus> :P
<AeroBunneh> omgyes
<AeroBunneh> I remember .co.uk
<SkyFetus> .co.uk was the bomb
<AeroBunneh> then there was the whole move thing and stuff
<SkyFetus> Where Arti and Lugia were like super crazy
<May> 14the crazy five were da bomb
<SkyFetus> o_o
<SkyFetus> Yeah I remember the move
<May> 14hey
<AeroBunneh> active RPs back in the day :'D
<SkyFetus> I didn't join lugia.us until like September 2007
<May> 14where is arti?
<SkyFetus> Aero
<SkyFetus> Get this
<SkyFetus> RPing in the shoutbox
<SkyFetus> THAT WAS UBERRIFIC
<AeroBunneh> XD
<SkyFetus> Arti is
<SkyFetus> I dunno
<SkyFetus> o_o
<SkyFetus> But yeah RPing in the shoutbox
<SkyFetus> When we all pretended to be legendaries
<SkyFetus> That was epic fun
<TheRunningDCD> fun fact
<May> 14omg or when
<TheRunningDCD> we're all in IRCHighway
*SkyFetus grows 100 years older
<Silverscreen> I get that it's courtesy, and no offense to the server or the channel, but, it's not like every single new channel here has to pay homage to it. I mean, that's what the chat is for anyway, making your own channels for others with your interest. I'm not trying to be a prick, I'm just stating my opinion on that.
<TheRunningDCD> if you want to visit it
<May> 14when your awesome story was still being written
<SkyRyd3r> LOL
<AeroBunneh> YOUR STORY
<May> 14I loved checking TST everyday
<May> 14just for it
<AeroBunneh> IS IT DEAD? D:
<SkyRyd3r> I WAS READING THAT STORY TODAY
<May> 14OH AND THE RPS
<SkyRyd3r> LOL
<AeroBunneh> RPs WERE AMAZING
<SkyRyd3r> I'm sooooooo pumped to write it again
<AeroBunneh> DO IT
<SkyRyd3r> When RP forum was live
<TheRunningDCD> Silverscreen: because making another general chat for basically the same topic in the same Server seems like overkill, yet we're doing it.
<TheRunningDCD> Might as well link it
<SkyRyd3r> That was bomb
<SkyRyd3r> But yeah
<SkyRyd3r> I feel like writing
<SheenaFox> then draw
<SkyRyd3r> .......
<SkyRyd3r> BUT I DON'T WANNA DRAW, I SUXX.
<TheRunningDCD> plus, fun fact: they still link to the /b/rony IRC even if the /b/rony IRC no longer links them in their topic
<AeroBunneh> NUUU
<May> 14y'know what
<SheenaFox> then wash it down with some butter
<TheRunningDCD> it's basically because it helps the fandom stick closer together
*SkyRyd3r slaps SheenaFox around a bit with a fish
<AeroBunneh> and mayo
<TheRunningDCD> don't think to hard about it
<AeroBunneh> don't forget the mayo
<Silverscreen> Alright.
<SheenaFox> and beer
<May> 14ohgawd
<May> 14OOH YAH
<SkyRyd3r> I'm on a diet people
<SkyRyd3r> Well
<SkyRyd3r> Sort of
<AeroBunneh> DAS BOOT
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, i know nothing about chatrooms
<TheRunningDCD> we just have to add to the topic
<May> 14DAS BEER
<TheRunningDCD> "Plus, make sure to check out #mylittlepony as well!"
<Ghosties> 4...Yeah, I'm just letting you guys talk amongst yourselves because I don't know chatrooms well either ^_^;
<Hipster_Brony> 8this might be the 1st chatroom i have ever visited on a regular basis
<Hipster_Brony> 8hell, i dont even im
<TheRunningDCD> basically whomever clicks on that channel link
<TheRunningDCD> visits the other channel
<TheRunningDCD> so yeah
<Kyro> NS!
<Ghosties> 4Same here, Hip. I do AIM a bit though
*Kyro tackles

<Ghosties> 4Well
<Silverscreen> ...I'm going to shut up about my past personal problems now.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, that can be potentially dangerous; especially through RPing. No offense, Silver.

<Ghosties> 4Something about RPing tends to bring out different personalities and attitudes in people

<Ghosties> 4And not in the proper sense of character either

<Hipster_Brony> 8maybe the fact that they're using different personalities and attitude http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/trollface.jpgs
<Silverscreen> oh, none taken. I learned my lesson.

<Bronypeanut> 13I can't RP well.
<Bronypeanut> 13At all
<Hipster_Brony> 8accidentally pasted it in front of the s
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Bronypeanut> 13Acting unlike myself is
<Bronypeanut> 13...
<Bronypeanut> 13Out of the question
<Bronypeanut> 13:P
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont rp at all, ever
<Ghosties> 4I've only RPed three times on Ponychan, and two of those times were RPing in a Silent Hill thread
<Hipster_Brony> 8just seems...
<Silverscreen> I RP, but my character always ends up acting like myself.
<Hipster_Brony> 8idk
<Hipster_Brony> 8unnatural
<SkyRyd3r> I see some guy passing out
<SkyRyd3r> And talking about beer
<SkyRyd3r> eggs
<SkyRyd3r> and bacon
<Ghosties> 4RPing in itself can be fun
<Bronypeanut> 13The only RP
<Bronypeanut> 13I've done
<SheenaFox> and sugar and cinnamon
<Bronypeanut> 13is that uh
<Bronypeanut> 13Ship with Rarity Sauce
<Ghosties> 4You get to be other people and act, which is something I've wanted to do for a while
<Silverscreen> I saw that. It was interesting.

<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Caaz> Timmi is the person who is born every day.
<Bronypeanut> 13Well.
<Bronypeanut> 13If I had more OC of a peanut pony
<Silverscreen> i guess the fact that one of my hobbies is acting kinda helps.
<Bronypeanut> 13I'd post with that.
<Bronypeanut> 13 90% of my ponies folder
<Bronypeanut> 13= rarity
<AeroBunneh> and buter
<AeroBunneh> butter
<AeroBunneh> I read that as butler lol |D
*Silverscreen has a folder for each of the mane cast, celestia, a big ass one for both luna and twilight, and one for Trixie.
<Silverscreen> oh, and the CMC
<SheenaFox> XD
<Silverscreen> I think Applejack is the one I post the least of.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have 3 subfolders of my /oat/ folder
<Armageddon> bbl
<Hipster_Brony> 8hipster glasses
<Hipster_Brony> 8spiderman
<Hipster_Brony> 8rainbow dash
<Silverscreen> Of course, she's my least favorite pony, so I guess it makes sense.
<Hipster_Brony> 8everything else is an unorganized mess
<SilverSonic> OFFICIAL: NGP is known as PSV = Playstation Vita
<Silverscreen> I was considering loading up on spiderman pics, but I don't like to derail on purpose, so I leave it to others.
<Ghosties> 4I just have a pony folder *shrugs*
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Hipster_Brony> 8i might have more spiderman pics than pony pics lol
*Silverscreen is organized when it comes to his files.
<Ghosties> 4I have a dedicated pony folder, a normal folder, and a wallpaper folder
<Hipster_Brony> 8i try not to derail with spiderman except in certain circumstances, but i use it as a general reaction image pretty frequently
<TheRunningDCD> I have all my shit sprawled around
*TheRunningDCD is NOT organized since he just doesn't give a shit
<Hipster_Brony> 8especially "nope", "come at me bro" and "how about i web your shit"
<Silverscreen> two of which you frequently use in BMN chat as well. :P
<SkyRyd3r> Talking about butlers?
<SkyRyd3r> That reminds me of a certain british Lugia
<Ghosties> 4That come at me bro pic is disturbing
<AeroBunneh> butlersss |D
<SkyRyd3r> Too bad he isn't on here anymore
<SkyRyd3r> As far as I know

<eXAKR> Tablet
<eXAKR> Pen, I know

<eXAKR> Hmmm
<NightSeas> 12Hmm, might be pushing too hard
<eXAKR> Could be
<eXAKR> I sent in a support ticket to Wacom
<Aurora> well if it's wearing the tablet down, that's insane
<eXAKR> Waiting for their reply
<Aurora> pen tips, those wear down and that's normal
<eXAKR> Yeah
<eXAKR> The tablet surface is not supposed to wear smooth that fast, no?
<NightSeas> 12I have a wacom, and so far, I have not seen any wear
<Aurora> ^
<Aurora> what do you mean by wear though
<NightSeas> 12@me or eXAKR o-o

<eXAKR> An ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE VERSION of Rebecca Black's Friday
<eXAKR> Sung without autotune
<eXAKR> And she actually can sing!
<eXAKR> It's a miracle!
<eXAKR> Autotune ruins songs.
<junh1024-XD> they can use autotune even on live concerts
<eXAKR> Eeek
<NightSeas> 12Lol, her real voice is a lot better
<eXAKR> She should try singing other songs
<eXAKR> She could try jazz
<eXAKR> Fly Me to The Moon
<eXAKR> Maybe
<eXAKR> I think she might do I Believe I Can Fly well too
<junh1024-XD> ahahahaha
<miiburd> her voice is kind of bothersome
<eXAKR> You know what
<eXAKR> She should ditch ARK
<Ascendant> my fingers are freezing off
<Ascendant> so is my face
<Ascendant> it's so coooooooooold
<eXAKR> Find maybe an indie label, or someone who doesn't use autotune
<eXAKR> Let her undergo a few years of training and such
<eXAKR> Then write GOOD songs for her
<eXAKR> She has the potential
<eXAKR> But unfortunately Friday ruined everything
<miiburd> well she knows how to sing
<miiburd> which is nice
<miiburd> but not terribly important in the grand scheme of things
<Silvernite> Freezing...
<miiburd> face
<Ascendant> it's freezing down here
<Silvernite> tell me about it XD
<Ascendant> Australia?
<Silvernite> Yup, Melbourne to be exact

<Silvernite> I'd much rather be in hot weather right now ^^
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> so cold it's not even funny
<Ascendant> but damnit, give us snow if it's going to get this cold :|
<miiburd> how cold is it?
<NightSeas> 12Winter in june :)

<Armageddon> hey, I'll share ;p
<Armageddon> and he was like like "Everybody should have a WoW account."
<Armageddon> and heh
<Armageddon> yesterday I was like "You tried to run me over with your car!" (in reference to something what happened about a month ago)
<Armageddon> and he was like "No I didn't. If I did, it wouldn't have been 'tried'."
<Drake> 04Oh I recall that

<Armageddon> because I was only wearing the taekwondo clothes + belt
<Armageddon> out the cold air
<Drake> 04ohshit

<Drake> 04would be hell frozen over.
<Drake> 04/bad joke
<Armageddon> It wasn't that bad after I ran around half the school
<Armageddon> for 5-10 minutes

<Armageddon> just wanted to bug him
<Armageddon> and then he ninja'd out of nowhere
<Armageddon> and scared the living daylights out of me
<Drake> 04Because bugging people who can run you over with a car is a wise decision.

<Armageddon> wat
<Armageddon> The only awesome science teacher is Kulesz
<Armageddon> and I haven't had him since year 7 ;-;
<Armageddon> I hate science anyway
<Armageddon> going to drop it when I get to year 11
<Armageddon> what about you, Drake?
<Armageddon> it's mostly because I've been failing in science since year 8 ;x
<Drake> 04I'm dropping it for 11-12
<Armageddon> :D
<Armageddon> ^5
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Espeon> 06And kind of not here right now, but hi :<
<Armageddon> heya and bye >:
<Armageddon> I need to go now too
<Drake> 04I'm going to do Extension English, Advanced English, Mathematics, Software Design and Development, Industry Technology - Multimedia, and either IPT or just IT
<Armageddon> but yeah Drake
<Drake> 04:<
<Armageddon> niiiiiiiice
<Armageddon> you're doing SDD too?
<Armageddon> and FUCK NO
<Drake> 04I think I'll go with IT because it's more practical
<Armageddon> DO NOT DO IPT
<Drake> 04lol
<Armageddon> DO NOT
<Armageddon> trust me it sucks
<Drake> 04IT has a more practical aspect to it, so I'm more "hands on"
<Armageddon> I went through a year of hell
<Drake> 04I need experience.
<Armageddon> just do SDD
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04I'm definately doing that
<Armageddon> I'm going to do Unit 4 maths, unit 2/3 english, SDD, mind and morality
<Armageddon> not sure what else at this stage
<Drake> 04Although the SDD teacher is thinking of changing our first topic from HTML coding to fucking LEGO Mindstorms crap.
<Armageddon> oh and music extension
<Armageddon> LOL Lego mindstorms
<Drake> 04We did that this year and it was terrible.
<Armageddon> I did it for mindquest
<Armageddon> in year 6
<Armageddon> it was pretty awesome
<Drake> 04I hated it.
<Armageddon> but we did it in year 8 for inno
<Armageddon> it was shit.
<Drake> 04I hated the drag-and-drop thing.
<Armageddon> it's a shithole
<Drake> 04I would've preferred 'regluar' coding, like how we're doing Java script now.
<Armageddon> lol javascript.
<Armageddon> I don't know a lot about javascript
<Drake> 04Hey, sir said it's the closest thing to C++ coding so I'm all for it.
<Armageddon> I know some of the syntax so ye-
<Armageddon> what the fuck.
<Armageddon> why do you want to learn C++?
<Drake> 04My friend said something about that's the coding video games are created with.
<Armageddon> C++ is a motherfucking assraping buttshiting titlicking cocksucking bitchface
<Drake> 04Naive as it sounds.
<Drake> 04wow
<Drake> 04And here I thought you'd reached your profanity limit for one sentence.
<Armageddon> I'm serious
<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04Prove me wrong.
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> but seriously
<Armageddon> some games are made in C++
<Armageddon> imo python and C are more popular
<Armageddon> if anything, learn C or python
<Drake> 04I'll check them all out.
<Armageddon> python is easy
<Armageddon> it's a good language to start with
<Armageddon> and it's pretty powerful
<Drake> 04K
<Armageddon> anyway, bbl piano

<eXAKR> was such a chore
<Ascendant> tell me about it lol
<eXAKR> 24 sites
<Ascendant> >30 IRC networks, 15 sites
<Ascendant> hurpaderp
<Ascendant> then again I could just get on mIRC and /scon -a ns set password newpassword
<Ascendant> so that's easy but I tend to use different passwords for every network
<eXAKR> Apple ID, Google ID, deviantART, flickr, Windows Live, CNet, Springpad, SimpleNote, Last.Fm, Opera Link, LiveJournal, Skype, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, commenting account on a blog network called Gawker, the jobs directory website I use, three forums (including Lugia.us), Pokemon Global Link, IMCDB
<eXAKR> Oh, I missed Dropbox
<eXAKR> I use the same password for every site
<eXAKR> If one is compromised, all is compromised
<eXAKR> I could love different passwords but my memory is fail

<eXAKR> Oh yeah, I also use a different password for my NickServ (which is the same across all networks) and that IdleRPG as well

<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Hm
<MajinMew> yeah some guy who had to skim it or whatever
<Espeon> 06inb4 not confirme
<Armageddon> when i first saw it I was like "uh is this guy advertising cactuses on 4chan or something"
<MajinMew> rofl
<Armageddon> cacti*
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Spyro seems to be running slowly
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4FPS is lucky to have a 1
<Damos> um why do I need a registered nick To join this channel
<Damos> ?
<UxieLover1994> 13Thanks, but how do I record gameplay?
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Maybe my comp is lagging
<MajinMew> the console and skyward sword are obvious
<MajinMew> Damos, +R was on
<Damos> dang
<UxieLover1994> 13My computer sometimes lags
<Armageddon> there was a small attack
<MajinMew> ssb4 is like
<Armageddon> nothing more/less
<MajinMew> expected
<Armageddon> xD
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Well not that i tried it (Note pcsx2 right now is lag) but my gba has a record button
<UxieLover1994> 13I'll give it a try soon
<MajinMew> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=nLhrgVJr
<MajinMew> whole thing
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4in the meantime i'll get those images
<UxieLover1994> 13I've found something for KHII (I don't know if it's a glitch), and I want to show it on YouTube
<MajinMew> also ssb4 will have pit, mario, link, kirby
<UxieLover1994> 13It's about the Drive Forms
<Espeon> 06and then CONFIRMED FOR SSB4 started all over again :p
<MajinMew> and maybe a sin and punishment thing
<UxieLover1994> 13I've accidently found it in Timeless River a few months ago
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4?
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Well i was gonig to be done after the GBA's but i had seen the artowrk in AHT as jpg
<UxieLover1994> 13Activate a Drive Form, then go into an area where your allies walk around as NCPs. You will be back in your normal form (don't forget some worlds have you change forms) and your bar is full
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Wow
<UxieLover1994> 13It is!
*Dark_Shadow_Dragon 4must kill all jpg
<UxieLover1994> 13That's right
<UxieLover1994> 13If I could, I'd record it to show you how it works.
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4ok
*Dark_Shadow_Dragon 4gets out his scythe to destroy all jpg
<UxieLover1994> 13But two problems: I'm unable to record (but what oui said earlier could change this), plus I don't like what Sora's Drive Forms look like in Space Paranoids
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Ah
<UxieLover1994> 13Valor, mostly. I activated this form a few months ago in this world, and I was shocked (I've seen the sequal when it was in cinemas late last year)
<DSD|Killingspree> 4Yea
<DSD|Killingspree> 4Dang lag
<UxieLover1994> 13I tried to activate Tron's limit, but I accidently hit the Left in the D-pad, and since Goofy was the other active Party Member, Valor it was
<Armageddon> zzz
<UxieLover1994> 13I activate Limits manually
<DSD|JPGKillingspree> 4Ah
<DSD|JPGKillingspree> 4Off to kill some JPG
<UxieLover1994> 13Be back soon, and don't forget to remind me of E3 when it starts!

<Steve> 12,7Hail Steve, the fabled Englushmen *Awesomesauce*
<UxieLover1994> 13Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure
<aggelos_the_dragon> i heard it sucks
<UxieLover1994> 13Ignore all those haters. They are not true fans
<DSD|E3> 4It looks good
<UxieLover1994> 13;)
<prince-dari> It looks bad.
<prince-dari> :P
<aggelos_the_dragon> i like the old spyro games for ps1.i first played them when i whas 1 years old and i still play
<UxieLover1994> 13Again. haters are not fans
<prince-dari> You can't just say "ignore anyone who disagrees with me, they are automatically wrong".
<prince-dari> I'm entitled to my opinion.
<prince-dari> I think it looks bad.
<aggelos_the_dragon> im not a hater i love spyro more than annyone
<UxieLover1994> 13So does most of the other "fans"
<DSD|E3> 4aggelos_the_dragon me to
<aggelos_the_dragon> yeah
<UxieLover1994> 13What are you going to do: vandalise the wiki's page for the game?
<UxieLover1994> 13I don't want that
<prince-dari> Have I done that? No.
<prince-dari> Did I say I was going to do that?
<prince-dari> No.
<UxieLover1994> 13But there is currently a 99% chance
<aggelos_the_dragon> are you arguing?
<UxieLover1994> 13No
<DSD|E3> 4Yes
<DSD|E3> 4they are
<aggelos_the_dragon> oh fuck
<prince-dari> Do you honestly think that I care at all about your wiki, much less enough to actually do anything?
<DSD|E3> 4Like a married copule
<DSD|E3> 4DAri wow man
<UxieLover1994> 13I hate haters of the game. People who hate SSA hate the whole series!
<UxieLover1994> 13That's my though!
<DSD|E3> 4Shes right
<DSD|E3> 4Don't hate
<aggelos_the_dragon> she?
<prince-dari> I'm not a 'hater', I just don't like the look of this new game.
<prince-dari> I don't hate it just "BECAUSE", I have my own reasoning.
<aggelos_the_dragon> yeah i believe that the only fans of spyro are the ones who love the first 3 insomniacs spyro games. because they are the originals
<aggelos_the_dragon> and there wont be more like them
<DSD|E3> 4You never know
<DSD|E3> 4Uxie is a girl
<aggelos_the_dragon> i wish they were more spyro like the first ones
<UxieLover1994> 13Yes, I am a girl
<UxieLover1994> 13The seires was once popular: now there are more haters than fans
<UxieLover1994> 13They ether became fans of Ratchet & Clank or took drugs
<UxieLover1994> 13That was sarcasom
<UxieLover1994> 13DSD and I are planning on doing a fannon series for YouTube. GA is involved, as well
<UxieLover1994> 13It will be baised on the classic series
<aggelos_the_dragon> you have to do that uxie
<UxieLover1994> 13I just hope we get the copyright from Activision to continue it and please fans
<aggelos_the_dragon> i hate ratchet and clank
<prince-dari> I am a 'fan' of the original 3 games (more so the first 2). You call everyone 'haters' just becauase we don't like the look of this new game?
<UxieLover1994> 13I LOVE that series!
<aggelos_the_dragon> yeah prince is right
<DSD|E3> 4GA?
<UxieLover1994> 13True fans love ALL games! Faux fans can love any game. New fans love the new games
<UxieLover1994> 13GastrodonAmy. She's a... friend of mine
<prince-dari> UxieLover1994: Hahaha, you make me laugh. That's the opposite of the truth.
<DSD|E3> 4I love all the games
<prince-dari> Fans usually get pissed off when the slightest thing doesn't go the way they want it to.
<aggelos_the_dragon> i didnt said i dont like the legend of spyro games i just want to say that they are different am i right uxie?
<UxieLover1994> 13DSD and I are true fans, Prince and Aggelos are faux-fans
<prince-dari> You be trollin'.
<UxieLover1994> 13Yeah
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm NOT trolling. I'm an admin at the wiki!
<aggelos_the_dragon> and im not a faux fan(whatever that means)
<prince-dari> It's some crap she made up to troll people with.
<UxieLover1994> 13Faux-fans are haters of the new game
<UxieLover1994> 13I heard that!
<prince-dari> Heard what? :o

<prince-dari> At least if you're going to insult someone do it properly, calling someone gay isn't an insult, if you're 17 I'd have thought you'd have grown up enough by now to realise that.
