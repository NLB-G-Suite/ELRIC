<AJIsAwesome> I never saw 13 as a bad number.
<Maid_RainBow> twilight_sprinkle : i think there will be more
<Yahooz> Shizuka: viewers. Not chatters
<Mutterguy> Well ifi t's not true then the Hub is gonna look silleh and shiall hear from mah lawyer >:(

<Shizuka> 13keep in mind that was over the course of the hour
<TheRandomkid321> When S3 is streamed us regulars need to stay together. Which is why they have all those separate rooms. IMO of course.
<Shizuka> 13or rather, by hour is the finest detail we could get
<Maid_RainBow> Shizuka : can you play Curtins from peterGabrial?

<Maid_RainBow> OMG Shizuka
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<Mutterguy> 0.o
<AdamTheDuck> Where is Nittany? XD
<Shizuka> 13shinji whined way too much for me to like him
<Vordox> Shizuka: In which version?
<Shizuka> 13both
<twilight_sprinkle> shinji whined while asuka got slaughtered to shreds, so i cant really like him after that
<Maid_RainBow> 0_o o_0
<Shizuka> 13in rebuild he went after rei and let asuka get a bridge dropped on her
<Shizuka> 13so he still sucks
<SirGanjalf> dude looked like a lady
<Vordox> <.< I thought you liked him way more in the second when he had some balls.
<Sylandest> night, everypony
<Vordox> Shizuka: Err... Isn't that a spoiler...?
<Sylandest> bed time for me
<Jmo> night
<Maid_RainBow> Shinj is the Bitch of Asuka
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Sylandest
<Sylandest> thank you for the stream, Shizuka. It was most peaceful and relaxing
<TheRandomkid321> I have started reading SURVIVE THE ZOMBIE OUTBREAK. God I hope when iot happes I am a carrier.
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Sylandest
<thelonepony> night Sylandest
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, /)
<Vordox> SO!
<Vordox> Anyone doing any Pony Games around her?
<Vordox> Here*
<TheRandomkid321> AdmaTheDuck (\
<Mutterguy> Woo go patient group Zero!
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: elaborate "doing"
<AdamTheDuck> Glad to see I'm not the only one preparing for the zombie apocalypes XD
<Vordox> "Creating"
<Vordox> Is that Asuka? <.<
<Jmo> How to spell AdamTheDuck.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i think quick_thinker wanted to make a game, but he was just starting learning programming for it so
<Shizuka> 13is me
<Vordox> O.o
<Shizuka> 13from high school anyway
<AdamTheDuck> Apocalypse?
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> Shizuka: *Prays to see you on stream someday*
<Jmo> There we go.
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Jmo> Good job diddums.
<Vordox> Shizuka: You got to go to a Con ONCE in your life!
*AdamTheDuck gives Jmo another lick
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Hmm, which code?
<Jmo> Get off meh
<TheRandomkid321> Well tomorrow is either school or excursian in which Iget the day off for I am not going because my class is full of buckwits. They bully me :(
<Vordox> Shizuka: are you that shy? :(
<Shizuka> 13yup
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: c++
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Oh mai, hardcore games
<Shizuka> 13bad experience with internet people in the past
<Vordox> Shizuka: I can understand that...
<Arcane> O:
<AdamTheDuck> So there isn't going to be a Shizucon? :<
<Arcane> Meeting people from the net has gone good for meh, Guess im just lucky
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: yah i guess, i dont think he knew what he was getting into though, but itd be cool if he managed to do it
<AdamTheDuck> But I want a plush pyro...
<Shizuka> 13so a random art that someone did for me in school is the closest anyone ever gets
<Vordox> Shizuka: But it shouldn't stop you from going where you want in real life, with new people or not. History is history, but you should learn from it, no?
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Hope so! C++ makes you able to make ANY game
<Mutterguy> blue eyes and pink heair should narrow it down a bit :P
<Shizuka> 13including the best game of all
<Shizuka> 13troubleshoot dat error
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: isnt visual c++ different though?
<Vordox> Shizuka: :D I'm not sure...
<TheRandomkid321> So I went on omegle finally... It was something like this... Penis... Penis... Fake breats... penis... Small Penis... Fake Penis.... Oh finally oh wait. They skipped me....
<Shizuka> 13Mutterguy: hasn't been pink in years
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Nah, C++ is c++, unless you think of the other codes, c and c#
*Mutterguy shrugs
<Shizuka> 13naturally blonde
<Vordox> Shizuka: Dem clue...
<Jmo> >.>
<Shizuka> 13so blonde hair blue eyes narrows it down to... about half the girls in the country
<Vordox> Shizuka: I'll visit you someday. :)
<Mutterguy> yep
<Vordox> Just randomly saying it, heh.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: hm ok. i forget, whats the difference between c++ and c#? i remember that the the # actually stands for 4 pluses
<Shizuka> 13C# has nothing to do with the Cs
<TheRandomkid321> computer about to die. I'll be on later.
<Shizuka> 13it's microsoft's spawn
<AdamTheDuck> Bye TheRandomkid321
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: C = Base Coding, C++ = Easier to code, C# = Easiest. Or something.
<Vordox> Basically, interface changes.
<Mutterguy> oh so the sharp is basically a window
<Red_M> ...
<Mutterguy> -pane
<twilight_sprinkle> my programming teacher explained what the ++ standed for, and he said that c# means c++++ but iforget why
<Vordox> Interface
<Phase4> Vordox, C++ is an extention to C, C# is a completely different language thats designed to look like C++ while internally being closer to java
<Vordox> Easier to code in C3
<Vordox> c#*
<Vordox> Well it's still inspired by eachother, so I see them as Sequels.
<Shizuka> 13C# does intermediate bytecode run on a VM
<Phase4> its 'easier' because of what Shizuka said
<Shizuka> 13C an C++ go to machine code
<Phase4> damnitninja
<Arcane> java is like a death mechinec_c
<Vordox> Native Machine code...
<Vordox> I want that knowledge.
<Shizuka> 13okay
<Shizuka> 13sec
<Jmo> Code is mentioned, Phase pops up.
<Phase4> memory is automatically managed in java and C#
<Phase4> Jmo, ikr!
<Shizuka> 13http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html do that
<Jmo> We now know how to summon him.
<Shizuka> 13buy the book if you want the rest of the VM implementation
<Shizuka> 13totally worth it
<Arcane> bb
<Shizuka> 13i built mine in gmod so :3
<Vordox> How about no Shizuka :P Not yet.
<Maid_RainBow> Shizuka : I love this song sinds you played Myst i believe
<Vordox> I love one thing about all these damn engine codes, Phase4
<Shizuka> 13Vordox: http://i.imgur.com/30EGP.jpg but it's awesome
<Vordox> The easier it is, the more restricted it is.
<twilight_sprinkle> im actually trying to code something in c++ right now, but its not working right, not a hard program though..
<AdamTheDuck> Shizuka, can you set up the fireplace.mp4 thingy again? :3
<Vordox> I'm WAY over my head already in Coding, Shizuka. I'm a game designer, I'm not supposed to do it yet, unless I really have gone full steam into a code.
<Phase4> Vordox, it's a tradeoff, javascript makes ui work INCREDIBLY easy but it is fully async, some things are easier to do synchrynously
<Vordox> Phase4: I know...
<Jmo> Not even saying please, tsk tsk AdamTheDuck.
<Vordox> Phase4: I hate it... That's the thing I'mr eally pissed off lately.
<AdamTheDuck> Yay \:3/
<Vordox> So many engine, so less functionanility
*AdamTheDuck huggles Shizuka
<Buytoast> that reminds me
<Buytoast> i still have to figure this list shit out
<Phase4> Java/C# manage memory automatically, but you lose pointers, a bit of performance, and are forced to use the object based structure
<Buytoast> it's starting to piss me off
<Mutterguy> 22 inch monitor makes an alomst reasonable sized fire place
<Arcane> Omg I got a ad for "Russian Girls love AMERICANS!" v_o
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02o3o
<Vordox> Phase4: <--- Prefers the object structure, and not the Class Structure.
<Jmo> Damn so many people getting angry lately.
<Phase4> Buytoast, each 'node' in a list has a pointer to the next node
<Panda> SB
<twilight_sprinkle> Arcane: the asian one is better :3
<thelonepony> NewSuperBronyU: Moo :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O3O

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, NewSuperBronyU. :)

<twilight_sprinkle> which makes derpy run on screen
<Shizuka> 13there's more but i don't wanna dig through my repo atm
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: FiM++ which is an imaginative code
<Phase4> Shizuka, i was just off to pastebin to write that down and add functions :P
<Panda> SB ; A ; I dont have my car yet though D:
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You have declared your variables O3O What is your next bidding master? o3o

<Phase4> Shizuka, he's probably got to write a class though, c++ teachers want that for some reason
<Vordox> So Shizuka! You love making music, is there a chance I may get to commission your music for a future game?
<Shizuka> 13nope
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: Okies, maybe tomorrow then ;~;

<Vordox> I know the feel...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Shizuka is one with everything.
<Phase4> Shizuka, dat feel
<Vordox> How there's a structure in learning...

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The structure of learning in US public schools is as follows: Step 1: Were they 1 min late? DISCIPLINE Step 2: Was their homework not in cursive? DISCIPLINE Step 3: Was the assignment done correctly but not in pencil? DISCIPLINE Step 4: Did that student just contradict my opinion about the yellow car in the novel representing depression instead of sorrow of the main character? AWWWW
<Panda> why do people use that word

<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck ignore that your name was in there >.<
<Invi> Lil_B, but isn't iron oxyde red?
<Mutterguy> Uhh i think carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are pretty important...
<Invi> Lil_B, copper is green
<Lil_B> Invi yes, but nobody said that iron is in the plants in form of oxyde
<Lil_B> AND, maybe the green is just the dominand color, have you even seen leafes turn red in the Fall?
<Moopy> hang on a sec i need to recycle my bin on here

<Invi> *rot
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: you are just learning my son soon you be wise like i!
<Lil_B> Invi no, leafes have multiple colors, it's just that when the Chlorophyl fades away, all the others become more visible
<Moopy> Hey how come Klumzeedragon hasn't been in the chat? its been like weeks from now
<NENUDJUS> what makes Chlorophyl green then

<DaringDerpy> then probably not, I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie. in the newsletter is a link where you can propose movies, in the lottery one of them is drawn
<Mutterguy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRbVsUTud-0&feature=related >.> not abridge sadly

<Starflash|Break> Throw in the oil, fire, deep fry stuff. easy :)
<DashWithRainbows> no tanks, eye'm kay.
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: Google isn't helping ;_;
<DashWithRainbows> It should help with basic deep frying...
<ScootaChicken> Starflash|Break: So just an ordinary saucepan then?
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i'll bring the stream back up again
<BaconMane> 0,5yey
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: what are you streaming anyway, I've never seen it before
<Lyra`> damn right you will Saturn
<Lyra`> or youre going to have a bad time
<Starflash|Break> Tbh, I don't have a deep fryer. So I just throw oil in a frying pan and it works pretty much the same once you've got the hang of it :)
<Jmo> Misfits o.o
*StinkomanFan continues cuddling Lyra`
<Dark_Horst> sound we have
<Dark_Horst> but no video
<Starflash|Break> we have sound
<Starflash|Break> but video no.
<Starflash|Break> o.o
<Starflash|Break> der it is
<ScootaChicken> Starflash|Break: So you don't need a deep fryer>
<ScootaChicken> *?
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: it's Misfits
<Starflash|Break> uhm, I don't. Ionno how big those wings are.
<MadSurge> Hey BaconMane! :)
<Hat> What show is this
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: Thank you my lord.
<CrimsonPhoenix> You know
<doctor_whooves127> so can someone do a run down of the powers that have been reveiled?
<Starflash|Break> but for regular size stuff, I guess a frying pan is enough ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01what are we deep frying?
<Starflash|Break> buffalo wings.
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: enough of that lord stuff, please
<CrimsonPhoenix> it would be interesting to have one that has the same curse as Lyra from background pony in there
<Saturn> 08,01it's starting to piss me off
<Hat> '
<BaconMane> 0,5this guy's creepin'
<Buytoast> don't do it man
<Starflash|Break> Saturn, you are kinda lord-level awesome, though. :)
<Hat> Where can I put show suggestions
<Buytoast> DON'T DO IT
*StinkomanFan finally clings to BaconMane
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: But sir!
<MadSurge> Saturn: you're so modest :)
<Saturn> 08,01Starflash|Break: <3
<BaconMane> 0,5yey cling
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: i'm also awesome
<Dark_Horst> oi shite
<ScootaChicken> Saturn: I'm trying to deep fry chicken wings, asking the chat for help.
<BaconMane> 0,5Deep fry yourself
<ScootaChicken> I don't own a deep fryer, which complicates things a bit.
<MadSurge> Saturn: yeah, I agree with Starflash|Break there
<Starflash|Break> ScootaChicken, what oil were you plannin to use?
*Bronysith licks Saturn
<ScootaChicken> Starflash|Break: Dunno, whatever's lying around
<Starflash|Break> olive is kinda expensive for the amount needed to fry in a fryin pan
<ScootaChicken> I was gonna pop in some butter as well
<ScootaChicken> Just for good measure
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, would you mind if I link a thread with a bunch of pictures?
<Starflash|Break> Oh, don't put in any water though :l
<Hat> ScootaChicken, put a few bottles of gasoline in the kitchen sink and throw your chicken wings in. Hover a blowtorch above the sink to heat it up BUT DO NOT SET IT ON FIRE. Easy chicken wings
<Apokalipse> ScootaChicken cooking? I wouldn't trust you with a spoon
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: what... kind of pictures?
<Starflash|Break> I tried that once to increase the amount, and then my wings got soaked
<BaconMane> 0,5Wait, are these guys in prison?
<Starflash|Break> that's pretty messed up
<Saturn> 08,01BaconMane: they're doing community service
<BaconMane> 0,5Oh
<ScootaChicken> I'm just gonna casually ignore Hat.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, mouth turn upside down screenshot from the actual show
<BaconMane> 0,5I was wondering why they're walking around free
<ScootaChicken> So Starflash|Break, how much oil do you reckon I'll need?
<ScootaChicken> I'm only gonna do like 10 or so
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's so sily and yet so hilarious and interesting
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: okay
<BaconMane> 0,5lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://boards.4chan.org/mlp/res/4907097 guys seriously this is hilarious
<Hat> Don't worry, my grandfather did it with an old car battery
<Lyra`> holy crap
<Apokalipse> Scootachicken. Get loads of oil and set it on fire. Then use water to kill the fire
<Starflash|Break> Well, I always manage with a 0.5 - 1 cm layer of oil
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: I only mean to show you the utmost levels if respect master!
<Lyra`> hes got a power :o
<Starflash|Break> not as much as you normally use in a deep fryer, I guess
<Lyra`> that sounds made up.
<ScootaChicken> Aight
<Lyra`> just saying.
<BaconMane> 0,5The bodies? DId theses guys murser some people??
<Starflash|Break> A guy, yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<Hat> Snowflake's upside down mouth
<ScootaChicken> So should I just put some oil into a saucepan, put it on the oven and then put in the chicken wings and wait?
<Lyra`> they murdered EVRYPONY

<Saturn> 08,01BaconMane: thye did

<ScootaChicken> What would I need a spatula for?
<Starflash|Break> Flip the snacks? ^_^ you arent literally deep frying them

<ScootaChicken> Alright, that seems decent enough.
<ScootaChicken> LET'S DO THIS
<Starflash|Break> GL
<Starflash|Break> and tbh
<Starflash|Break> I think it tastes better than deep fried ~_~
<Starflash|Break> and you don't get shitty oil
<Starflash|Break> so that's cool
<Saturn> 08,01BaconMane: 1 so far
<BaconMane> 0,5So how come they say "bodies"?

<Jmo> Just a bloody trout.
<StinkomanFan> I'd actually have prefered Tales from the Crypt, or The Twilight Zone
<Apokalipse> It's a large trout though
<DoctoDoctorWho> StinkomanFan: where's my mummy
<CrimsonPhoenix> For me it's basically this; while movies in theaters are more accessible and popular, I think the true talents goes into play as it take more skills in plays to bring the characters alive and LIVE at that.
<StinkomanFan> The Twilight Sparkle Zone!
<CrimsonPhoenix> and if you ever get to one it's just something bigger than a simple movie
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix I agree, takes more skill to act live
<ASoftFluffyThing> Why does everyone here slap with the large trout? What's wrong with the other fish?
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's why I do enjoy plays more than movies in theater
<Jmo> What other fish?
<StinkomanFan> Maybe even Courage the Cowardly Dog, or The Outer Limits
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't know, cod? Sea bass? Shark? Stingray?
<StinkomanFan> "We control the horizontal."
<Jmo> When mIRC implements another fish, I shall use it.
<StinkomanFan> "We control the vertical"
<Jmo> Till then, large trout will supply my needs.
<Jmo> :>
<SirGanjalf> I used to have a herring and cut trees with it, but then i lost it
<Lil_B> Chat you have to decide for me!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Holy shit, I found a mineshaft!
*Jmo pats ASoftFluffyThing
<Lil_B> Should I get up and get some Cotton Candy or not?!
<Dken2021> ASoftFluffyThing prepared to get lost and resort to digging up
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lil_B, yes. Because you know you want to
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dken2021, I am prepared. and since I'm playing on peaceful mode, NO MOOOOOOOBS!

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Woke up to pretty intense storms this morning.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thought I was going to be hit by a tornado.
<Dken2021> wow, that bad huh?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nah. The storms weren't warned. It was a small QLCS. Decent lightning with it, though.
<DoctoDoctorWho> the best day of my life is when I get C&C 3 and find out how to participate in stream against a mod
<ASoftFluffyThing> I know that feel, Nittany_Discord. It's really scary if it's in the midle of the night
<Jmo> I love storms. They're relaxing.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jmo: same, /)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I did some storm chasing when I was in grad school.
<Jmo> only in America.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hoh my god alll this cooooooal and lava
*ASoftFluffyThing is afraid of thunderstorms
<SafariMonkey> Does anyone know how to use the "Bone weight copy" script? The documentation seems lacking.
<StinkomanFan> Nittany_Discord! Stream some SCARY STUPH!
<SafariMonkey> Sorry wrong channel again
<Jmo> Tsk tsk
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Someone else is trying to set up a stream.

<DoctoDoctorWho> Defence f*** yeah
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Yep but one superweapon and master a cluster of energy plants usually takes care of that to allow me to rush

<VenHur> Hello everypony!

<DoctoDoctorWho> DashWithRainbows: A turtle vs turtle, I usually curbstomp all the AI's once my armies get up to full steam so it'll be nice to see which turtle stands strong in the face of the opposing warmachine
<Jmo> hm
<DashWithRainbows> Well, if I'm fighting AI, I either steamroll or rush for resources.
<StinkomanFan> SCP the movie sounds... pretty cool actuallu
<StinkomanFan> Evenmoreso if it's directed by Ed Wood or his modern day equivilent

<Sumica> 00,10ep 7 of second gig we finaly get to the main arc
<MadSurge> Sumica: the villains of the series?
<Tervicz> It's a trap!
<DashWithRainbows> personally, I'm not really bothered because I don't care. It's the others that you should worry about.
<MadSurge> Yaaaay

<Jmo> Pom pls.
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Sumica> 00,10that guys face is freaky
<CriticKitten> I'm noticing a serious problem I have with this series. This entire sequence is trying very, very hard to minimize the amount of animation it has to perform at once.
<StinkomanFan> You should see her gold metals from the Bedroom Olympics
<DashWithRainbows> :>
<DashWithRainbows> kk
<Jmo> ;D
<cachi01> DaringDerpy: STFU AND TAKE MY MONEY
<Jmo> good DWR.
<Lyra`> dfv0\
<Lyra`> what are we watching
<CriticKitten> Look at how many times it cuts to a guy just blankly staring without even speaking, or how often the person speaking isn't moving in ANY other way. Not so much as a blink or twitch.
<Lyra`> ZOMG! they need to make a fallout 3 anime!
<Lyra`> OH EM GEE
<CriticKitten> The characters are so lifeless and freaky. ._.
<VenHur> DaringDerpy: ALL OF MY MONEY! ALL OF MY GODDAMN MONEY!
<cachi01> DaringDerpy: WHERE CAN I BUY IT?
<Sumica> 00,10they wrote the name of the portal gun wrong on the box
<Reactor> CriticKitten: Animation is HARD
<AnFo> :>
<VenHur> DaringDerpy: YEAH, WHERE?!
<Wrek> 05ohai
<DaringDerpy> they cost circa $150 per piece. for making blue light and portal sounds. toys r us has them
<CriticKitten> Reactor: Too hard to bother with basic human functions? Then maybe they shouldn't draw humans. :p
<VenHur> Sumica: ...It's...fake?
<Shamroc> ohai Wrek
<cachi01> Sumica: uhmm nope the name is correct
<Reactor> CriticKitten: I agree
<DaringDerpy> hi Wrek
<cachi01> its atlas ASHPD
<CriticKitten> OH FUCK IT'S ZOMBIE HEATH LEDGER
<Sumica> 00,10hai wrek
<StinkomanFan> SPEAKING of that, has Equestrian Innovations released anything new yet?
<VenHur> Well...it looks real to me, it even has the Valve Logo....
<cachi01> ^
<Sumica> 00,10i know it's real but they did't use the full name of the gun
<Saturn> 08,01wheeeee
<cachi01> but i thought ASHPD was the fulll name
<VenHur> Well, we know that's it real, BUT...
<Silver_Soother> cachi01: I thought so too.
<VenHur> Can it fire portals?
<cachi01> VenHur: will it blend? that is the question
<killerpony7733> Wrek Gonna play PS2 later tonight?
<DaringDerpy> http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=13164765 it's real
<Silver_Soother> cachi01: (insert a catchy little tune)
<DaringDerpy> and of course it can fire portals
<Sumica> 00,10guess that is the offical name
<Wrek> 05not as much as yesterday. got a meetign at 8 tomorrow
<Tervicz> Bulma?
<Sumica> 00,10could have swarn they never said portal in the name in the first game
<CriticKitten> See? Look how often there's only ONE thing moving on the screen at a time. One guy turns his head, one mouth moving, everything else is totally still. Or at times, there's nothing moving at all. It's incredibly freaky.
<cachi01> DaringDerpy: i already know what i want for my bday besides the OUYA
<DaringDerpy> hehe
<BaconMane[LC]> 0,5Well i honestly prefer someone not just walk in after seeing the channel name in a video
<Silver_Soother> Sumica: I thought it was referred to as the Apperture Sciene Hand-Held Portal Device in the first game, at least once.
<VenHur> But can it fire portals? I'm skeptic...
<Chrysalis> ohai Wrek
<BaconMane[LC]> 0,5Nothing personal, it's just how it's usually been.
<CriticKitten> Omg, two things moving at once, don't have a seizure there animators. XD
<VenHur> If it can, then ALL OF MY MONEY, VALVE!
<DaringDerpy> hope you have fun with it, cachi01 :)
<cachi01> i will :3
<Ponies47> Well ok then. If you want me to leave just kindly say so and I won't come back
<VenHur> Aww...it's just an action figure replica...
<cachi01> Ponies47: just stay xd
<DerpyMuffins> What we watching?
<Silver_Soother> DerpyMuffins: Ghost in the Shell.
<thelonepony> Ghost in the shell
<Ponies47> cachi01: You did the same thing as me
<cachi01> yep
<cachi01> :3
<thelonepony> damn it
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: :D
<Sumica> 00,10that guys face is so freaky
<cachi01> but i already had the ide of the room's name
<cachi01> idea*
<VenHur> Still, I take the portal gun, even if it just an action figure, and that i'm too old for toys.
<Silver_Soother> thelonepony: :3
<DerpyMuffins> This is kinda creepy
<Mega_Milk> yeah....messed up face guy doesnt sit with me right....
<VenHur> Well, mind you, i'm still young at heart!
<MadSurge> Did a bobcat run over that guy's face?
<StinkomanFan> "Oh, don't mind how I look. I just got into a knife fight with Commander Shepard."
<cachi01> growing up is fro pussies!
<ScootaChicken> Woah woah woah back the fuck up
<Sumica> 00,10You have to grow old but you dont have to grow up
<CriticKitten> Incidentally, making an abridged series of this show should be easy. The lip-flapping is done for you
<ScootaChicken> Why the fuck are there new people in here
<ScootaChicken> ELSIE
<ScootaChicken> WAT R U DOING
<BaconMane[LC]> 0,5Not my fault o/
<ScootaChicken> ELSIE
<ScootaChicken> STAHP
<DerpyMuffins> Im stil an 8 year old at heart
<Apokalipse> It is all your fault bro
<MadSurge> Sumica: wise words
<BaconMane[LC]> 0,5ok yes my fault
<BaconMane[LC]> 0,5but whatevs
<ScootaChicken> You got Sumi to stream them vidyas.
<DerpyMuffins> So is my grammar
<Sumica> 00,10any animation can say the same CriticKitten
<Mega_Milk> she didnt blink through that whole speech segment....
<CriticKitten> 'tis true. But it's especially easy here, where there aren't other actions accompanying the lip-flaps.
<DerpyMuffins> That face is so creepy
<CriticKitten> Usually you have to snip a segment short to avoid showing the character doing things. Here? Just let it ride. :P
<CriticKitten> Oh, hey, a new low score. Brilliant. -.-;
<CriticKitten> Now I think they're just trolling me, scoring low on their tests on purpose just to make me feel bad.
<BaconMane[LC]> 0,5bleh
<cachi01> ScootaChicken: cause why dafuq not
<ScootaChicken> IT VIOLATES THE STATUS QUO ASFJAJCAJFOJ
<Sumica> 00,10be worried when they start scoreing in the negitive.
<Mega_Milk> ha
<BaconMane[LC]> 0,5Newfags r worstfags
<CriticKitten> I'm already worried, because I'm grading Calc tests and they're making Algebra mistakes

<MadSurge> Hey bluemane!
<Apokalipse> ...would it make me feel as if I sniffed paint?
<DerpyMuffins> The freaky guy dies right?
<Apokalipse> That also makes you lose brain cells
<Apokalipse> ...err, or so I hear

<Sumica> 00,10when we can do it in explosions
<DashWithRainbows> I don't know.
<bluemane> Hey! MadSurge and thelonpony alexxm|colt! things are good thx hbu?
<DashWithRainbows> Ask Bronysith.
<Dken2021> amen!
<DashWithRainbows> He seems to have sniffed a lot of paint as a child.
<StinkomanFan> "Here's a slide show from my vacation."
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Which is fine, except when 90% of the show is exposition.
<Apokalipse> I don't want to he's Bronysith
<DashWithRainbows> I think you mean paint thinner though.
<MadSurge> bluemane: They're good, yeah :)
<alexxm|colt> i'm good bluemane
<CriticKitten> I love the show, but it's still pretty jarring in retrospect. :P
<MadSurge> CYBERJESUS
<Sumica> 00,10lawl
<bluemane> thats good CriticKitten
<Apokalipse> Well it is more vaporous
<StinkomanFan> I didn't know Jesus was a fan of Daft Punk

<MadSurge> ARGH lag again
<CriticKitten> Lot of hanging on my end.
<StinkomanFan> ...Is he in a boxing ring or something?

<Ninjazz> Invi, not to my knowledge. That shiny + only means he makes important announcements.
<Invi> Ninjazz, oh wait, he was the technician or kinda like that
<Shizuka> 13phase is our cache guru
<Stallion_of_War> I'd have a stream for going up, and a stream for going down, and a third stream just for shoooooooowwww
<Ninjazz> Techie eyup.

<CriticKitten> Shizu: I know that song. Not sure if good or bad. ._.
<Shizuka> 13saturn is our hosting guru, he pays for our domain and space
<Ninjazz> Oh so he's the got to guy for when the site drops?
<StuffCrusader> cool
<Shizuka> 13not really, it's managed by cloudflare so drops are generally derps on their end
<Ninjazz> I didn't know that Saturn pays for the place. :O
<Invi> ^
<cachi01> http://derpy.me/yQPEO
<Stallion_of_War> Shizuka: I belive the origional is "yiddle diddle diddle diddle diddle die" or something
<Ninjazz> Oh. But he manages the site while it's under heavy load?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> does that make otakon bronystate mascot shizu ?

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> 2d lieutenant Maid_cord in the war againt dust
<Panda|Drawing> Nittany_Discord D: dood thats awesome!
*Bronysith puts DashWithRainbows in a locked room with molestia
<Kurra> wait what?
<cachi01> 2nd Lieutenant that sounds so awesome lol
<DashWithRainbows> Yeah, no.
<Ryunosuke> Ninjazz, no, its a job
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz yeah, who else is going to be in charge of checking the weather systems?
<flutterchu> hugs Jmo
<Ninjazz> In the Air Force, though? o_O
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz this is the Air Force he's talking about
<Ryunosuke> basically a weather officer is the weatherman for the air force
<DashWithRainbows> Also, Sith, you'll need to put a capital letter when writing a name.
<Panda|Drawing> Nittany_Discord, when are you gonna go in for evaluation?
<Ninjazz> ( '__') I still don't get it.
<Jmo> ew hugs, so touchy touchy.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't know Panda|Drawing.
<DashWithRainbows> TheGreatAndPowerfulT nu
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz the Air Force is in charge of all the planes and other flying shit. Do you think it would be a good idea to have a multi-million dollar aircraft fly out into unknown weather conditions?
*adasdad slaps trout around with large jmo
<Ninjazz> The only thing jaymoo likes touching is a large trout. He keeps it in his grip at all times.
<Ryunosuke> http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2010/04/steve-carell-weather-report.jpg -- what Nittany_Discord will be doing basically :0

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Listened to music while I did it.
<Lunar_Brony> sounds like me writing a fan-fic
<Lunar_Brony> or three
<Ninjazz> And still focused?!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Focusing was a challenge.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And being overwhelmed was as well.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I listen to music when I have to work. It makes it easier.
<Ninjazz> Dayum right. Especailly with music playing.
<Jmo> Off to bed I go, woop.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn wanted to see my OC in a dress. There's four pics.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Back when Maid Hour was popular.
<Panda|Drawing> before the fire nation attacked
<Ninjazz> Back then. :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Before the RP nation attacked.
<Lunar_Brony> we ALL know what happened to Maid Hour, though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I canned it.
<Serenity> Nittany_Discord: Heh, good times.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Silently.
<Ninjazz> And painfully.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> When we had to write essays in social studies, my teacher wrote "their" and "there" on the board. I was going to tell her to write "they're" also, but I was too lazy
<Lil_B> Invi don't know "Well... there was something we should have done already" I don't know what, maybe a long big routine check
<Panda|Drawing> Nittany hung up his duster in silence.
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<Lunar_Brony> I miss being dusted with a brick :(
<Lil_B> Invi btw. I'm currently upÃ¼ again with my search for a name >.<
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dusting was funnn
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah, but it can get awkward.
<Ninjazz> I was only in it for the wax.
<Lil_B> Well... the RP Guys went somewhere were Maid Hour is 24h
<Ninjazz> I let you all have your dust.
<Ninjazz> Lil_B, COUGH COUGH.
<Invi> true
<Lil_B> Ninjazz yyerp, exactly
<Panda|Drawing> Lil_B hehe good riddance?
<Ninjazz> COUGH COUGH COUGH.
<Lunar_Brony> WHAT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Everyone including me was starting to take maid hour too far to where it was 3 and 4 hrs.
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz what do you want?
<Lil_B> Panda|Drawing help me, whats riddence? I don't know what that means :/
*Invi gives Ninjazz some coughing medicine
<Ninjazz> I want a damn sandwich, Lunar_Brony.
<donutpop365> Sorry everypony, I missed Friday movie night :P
*Panda|Drawing gives Ninjazz, dammmit Invi
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Ninjazz: *sandvich
<Ninjazz> I an't no heavy.
<Invi> Panda|Drawing, :D
<Panda|Drawing> Ninjazz is heavy
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz too bad, BerryPunch isn't active. Besides, you need to be a mod for her to call you silly for making an invalid request.
<Lunar_Brony> silly
<Invi> Ninjazz, how heavy are yu? ^^
<Ninjazz> 230 lbs. Hah Murikan system.
<Lunar_Brony> 140 pounds
<Ninjazz> People keep mistaking me for a football playinger. >_<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wow. I'm only 206.
<Lil_B> Ninjazz use Metrics!
<Ninjazz> NEVER!
<Invi> 70kg, that's normal
<Ninjazz> MWAHAHAHAHA.
<Serenity> I'm lighter than you all
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I used to be 230 when I graduated high school. Never again.
<Invi> Serenity, how do you know?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> because he's a conformist. Real hipsters sue customary.
<Serenity> 54 kg with a BMI of 19.4
<Kawaii_icybeauti> use*
<Invi> Serenity, then you are smaller though ^^
<Lil_B> I'm always between 70 and 80 somewhere
<Lil_B> kg that is
<Serenity> Invi: Only 5"2'
<Lunar_Brony> I don't use metrics for weight, unless I'm doing scientific calculations in which grams is standard.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Going to the Air Force will get my BMI to ideal instead of over.
*Panda|Drawing used to be 250 before he started skating >.>
<Invi> Serenity, that doesn't tell me athing cuz I'm not 'murican ^^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I started walking and running one or twice a day.
<Serenity> I'm not either!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I eat less.
<Serenity> How dare you
<Ninjazz> Air Force doesn't require much physical training though, right?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I cheerlead. It's literally the only sport I can do.
<Serenity> Also, that's the standard way of measureing someone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't know.
<Serenity> 5 foot 2 inches.
<Invi> Serenity, it is? never heard of it
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I'm about 5ish
<Ninjazz> You'll probably spending more time in air craft than on the ground, so probably.
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz depends, probably. You need to be fit if immediate evacuation is required
<Serenity> Also, doesn't help that I'm thin as hell
<Kawaii_icybeauti> You europeans and your metric system......
<Lunar_Brony> Kawaii_icybeauti hey, we use metric up north too
<Ninjazz> Lunar_Brony, well, THAT yes. Can't be physically inapt in the the armed forces and what not.
<Lunar_Brony> atleast, we're supposed to
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: Sorry, canadians too. And happy thanksgiving to you!
<Lunar_Brony> Kawaii_icybeauti thank you! I completely forgot about my awesome long weekend.
<Lunar_Brony> I can sleep in tomorrow!
<Invi> me can'tz
<Ninjazz> 5am.
<Panda|Drawing> XD
<Ninjazz> I should think about bed soon.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: I'm getting it a little later on. My social studies teacher actually left school because she's canadian and went to celebrate. We have columbus day tomorrow, so I can sleep in too!
<Lunar_Brony> yeah . . .
<Invi> Ninjazz, soon as in 12h? :D
<donutpop365> Hi AJIsAwesome|Asleep "Can't hear ya, I'm asleep"?
<Ninjazz> Invi, close to that, yes.
<Ninjazz> Also, I've defeated joomay.
<Lunar_Brony> seems legit

<thelonepony> Dark92Enigma: good right now :)
<Bunny_Striker> Dark92Enigma: I got a splinter in my foot
<Ponies47> Hey Dark92Enigma
<AJIsAwesome> Bunny_Striker: Ouch.
<Dark92Enigma> well, i'm at my parent's house, taking care of everything while they're asleep..........had a great Movie night yesterday
<Dark92Enigma> Bunny_Striker: awwwwwwww
<Dark92Enigma> despite the bad B movie
<Dark92Enigma> that's why i enjoyed it
<AJIsAwesome> It was bad, but not WMC bad. :D
<Kandarihu> I didn't hate the B Movie as much as I probably should've.
<Bunny_Striker> WMC?
<Dark92Enigma> Bunny_Striker: my cousin had the same trouble
<AJIsAwesome> Worst Movie Clause.
<Bunny_Striker> ohh
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: It's not a TERRIBLE movie, but down right dissapointing
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Pretty much.
<AJIsAwesome> It got a Wine Spritzers/10 for me.
<Kandarihu> I generally focus all of my capacity for hate for the truely evil things that threaten all the good things in this world.
<Bunny_Striker> I love B movies, they make me laugh
<Bunny_Striker> at how crappy thet are
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Same here.
<Dark92Enigma> it had some buildup, fantastic animation but that's the only redeeming things about it........Oh, the Villain is pretty good, but had LITTLE TO NO SCREENTIME
<Dark92Enigma> Bunny_Striker: I'm gonna take on B movies like that
<Kandarihu> Oh yeah. This is the raciest thing that 4Kids ever put out. References to alcohol and death are heard in it. And there's even multicolor STROBING.
<Dark92Enigma> Like VENOM, Darth Maul, and............any villain
<Kandarihu> Did the IRC explode with ZUUL during the A movie?
<AJIsAwesome> yep. :D
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: EEEEEEEEEEEEYUP
<sonicandmario85> hello :3

<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: Did they end up bonding?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu, you did? Sorry about that
<Kandarihu> ASoftFluffyThing, no trouble
<sonicandmario85> AJIsAwesome:whats that?

<cachi01> +k
<taoumi> i come in and there's a party goin' on right here
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: Basically what I mean is, did they get along fine? :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, taoumi. Welcome to the party! :)
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, that's normal for this series.

<thelonepony> thanks GigabitHarmonie for the tunes :)
<Kandarihu> Oop. Never mind. I guess I'm not.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Thanks for the tunes and stream, GigabitHarmonie
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: Yes, it is......but although it's supossed to be a movie, it left me dissapointed because the pacing is the same (i don't know if the japanese version is better, but i guess it is)
<Dark92Enigma> Thanks GigabitHarmonie !
<Dark92Enigma> brb
<Kandarihu> I'm not sure about the pacing or the silence, but in the original TV series, the music is better. But that should go without saying.
<cachi01> thx GigabitHarmonie :)
<Kandarihu> Er, original as opposed to the dub.
<GigabitHarmonie> :)
<sonicandmario85> AJIsAwesome:also the red ones are responsible for killing one of the chickens because they kept pecking it those red ones were pecking everyone in the eye now we have 12 of them
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: Aw, man. That sucks. :(
<sonicandmario85> the one that died was a younger one then them
<sonicandmario85> it might have been from it being cold in there so we put a blanket on the cage now its warm in there

<Sumica> 00,10so what is the point of this?
<Shizuka> 13you'll see
<cowvarkian> Sumica: theres a point?
<Shizuka> 13the overall point is we have to melt the butter statue of the black buddha
<Arcane> Sumica to burn your eyes
<AdamTheDuck> There's always a point.
<alexxm|colt> so was this game any good
<Shizuka> 13to do that, we block certain tunnels to direct heat
<StinkomanFan> You get a cookie. It is old and crumbly and all the chocolate chips fell out.

<Saturn> 08,01this kinda reminds me of Myst and The Daedalus Encounter
<Sumica> 00,10ah ok

*AdamTheDuck already likes this song because of the title XD
<oni_link> lmao
<linsett> If only all drummers were as enthusiastic as this one.
<CriticKitten> Arcane: GvG? Bah. Lamesauce on rye. People love to brag about GW1's PvP system, but honestly it was really really bad. >_> The fact that they had to constantly rebalance every single profession and so many skills, and yet it's STILL broken makes that rather clear.
<oni_link> This song, it shall be my theme when my beard gets as bushy as the singers
*weegee2062 sings smile smile smile

<weegee2062> stop looking at me
<Spitfire> is Shizuka still streaming?
<CriticKitten> Arcane: And honestly? The PvP was probably the one thing GW1 could hold over GW2, simply because of how limited the PvP is.
<oni_link> Saturn: SMOKE. Are you smoking yet/.
<Arcane> CriticKitten I loved GvG so much, Most orignal PvP system to date. My guild and I win nearly every tourny on FA server It feels really weak now
<oni_link> ?
<Ponies47> Spitfire: Nope. Saturn now

<Shamroc> hai hai Saturn...
<Polydunami> Oh my, it's a pony

<weegee2062> it's a time machine
<Saturn> 08,01because it's bigger on the inside
<CriticKitten> Arcane: Whereas in GW2, I jumped into WvW and with no experience whatsoever, I killed 58 people despite everyone in the Guru forums claiming that Rangers are so terrible.
<Polydunami> This is the opposite of a thunderstorm: the thunder comes BEFORE the lightning
<Saturn> 08,01and it makes funny noises
<cachi01> Saturn: how much storage does TARDIS has?
<cowvarkian> I've seen a few episodes of this

<Saturn> 08,01well, for most things
<cowvarkian> Saturn: mine has 500 GB...
<StinkomanFan> This is pretty much a british HEROES
<CriticKitten> Arcane: That's indicative to me that actual skill finally trumps that sort of elitist skill-build shit in this game.
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: WE'RE HARDDRIVE BROTHERS
<Saturn> 08,01/)
<Sumica> 00,10500gb, so tiny

<Sumica> 00,10so if you call a flashlight a torch, what do you call torches?
<cowvarkian> Sumica: torches?
<prince-dari> What's the difference?
<Shizuka> 13flaming sticks
<cachi01> Sumica: sticks with fire
<prince-dari> They're both torches
<Kurra> See, this is why the rest of the world makes fun of the US...
<Sumica> 00,10see that's just confuseing
<prince-dari> We use context to work things out
<cowvarkian> Sumica: yes, it is
*Saturn 08,01hugs Shizuka
<prince-dari> But that's too complciated for America, for some reason.
<prince-dari> :P
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: apparently it is
<prince-dari> If a torch is on a wall
<prince-dari> It's clearly of the firey stick variety.
<StinkomanFan> So the sentance "Daring Do carried the torch." Could mean EITHER in England?! :o
<Kurra> Hey Prince-Dari....
<Sumica> 00,10bullshit dari.
<weegee2062> he take
<prince-dari> XD

<prince-dari> If you can't work out what a writer is saying, they're just bad at writing.
<weegee2062> sorry no
<cowvarkian> Kurra: whats a vlueberry
<prince-dari> Simple as that
<Sumica> 00,10emergency flashlights
<Kurra> blueberry. blueberry.

<prince-dari> In which case you'c call it an emergency torch
<StinkomanFan> Sooooo which is Daring Do carrying?
<weegee2062> throw random stuff at him
<Kurra> cowvarkian, partly comes from an Applebloom mlfw pic
<prince-dari> It's not that hard to make it clear to whoever's reading what you mean.
<prince-dari> If you can't do that, then you're a terrible writer
<J_E_Smith71> Well the Simpsons Halloween Special for this year is coming on. Let's see how they managle the once great special.
<Sumica> 00,10or you could just have a workd for it and leave no room for doubt
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: its a light that flashes, so its a flashlight
<Sumica> 00,10word
<J_E_Smith71> IT sounds like they're doing a 2012 type story this year
<prince-dari> Well, they don't usually flash.
<prince-dari> They're usually constantly on, or constantly off.
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: emergency ones do
<prince-dari> Hence 'emergency torch'
<weegee2062> lolk
<afterburner> ixoc
<prince-dari> Not just 'torch'

<cowvarkian> StinkomanFan: yes
<prince-dari> So you name all of a thing after a function that only some of the thing have?
<twilight_sprinkle> a flashstick
<weegee2062> a flaming flashlight
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: I don't know, maybe they all did it in the beginning
<cachi01> a flaming light and a flashstick
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: and now only some of them don't
<Kurra> And YOU name everything after something that is based on a flame and not incandescence or fluourescence or diode radiation?
<cachi01> ok dafuq is happening
<Kurra> fffffs
<Dovah> prince-dari: torch/tÃ´rCH/Noun:	A portable means of illumination such as a piece of wood or cloth soaked in tallow or an oil lamp on a pole, sometimes carried ceremonially.
<cowvarkian> cachi01: we're arguing about arbitrary names
<Sumica> 00,10early models did indeed flash.
<weegee2062> yes
<prince-dari> Dovah: Yes, it's caleld American English.
<cachi01> cowvarkian: i mean in the stream
<StinkomanFan> We're trying to figure out WTH Daring Do is carrying
<Sumica> 00,10some sill have the breaker on them to cause them to flash
<prince-dari> called*
<cowvarkian> cachi01: misfits, british TV show
<prince-dari> English definition would include flashlight as a secondary meaning.
<Kurra> prince-dari, are you really really trying to--
<cachi01> cowvarkian: YEAH I KNOW but the were suddenly pawnching that guy while bowling
<oni_link> Installing Skype woot woot
<StinkomanFan> Imagine "Heroes" but British and everyone's an Asshat

<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> No, it isn't.
<Kurra> twilight_sprinkle, come again?
<cachi01> Dovah: nope
<prince-dari> American English is pretty vastly different to English.
<twilight_sprinkle> not That vastly
<cachi01> Dovah: thats like saying Latin spanish is the same as Spain Spanish
<weegee2062> call the money police
<Ponies47> God Canterlot Gardens was so much fun
<Sumica> 00,10just tell dari you could care less about his english.
<Ponies47> I loved every minute of it

<Saturn> 08,01what do they call a sheep tied to a lamppost in Wales?
<prince-dari> You guys are never going to stop me from complaining about it though

<cachi01> Saturn: wut?
<Saturn> 08,01a leisure centre
<cowvarkian> Saturn: do tell
<weegee2062> oh god i'm sick that shene was not good for me
<cowvarkian> Saturn: hah
<cachi01> Saturn: lol
<Saturn> 08,01sorry for the pause, i couldn't remember how to spell "leisure"
<cowvarkian> Saturn: wait... I'm partly welsh in a strange way
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: and youll never stop people from calling fire sticks torches, and football called soccer:P
<prince-dari> But I wouldn't still be me if I didn't try.
<cachi01> but soccer is real football
<cachi01> u damn murricans stole the name!
<cowvarkian> cachi01: well obviously
<Kurra> Okay for every UK person in here who's being all adversarial about language: I'm American. I don't have any angsts or irritations about cariances between American English and UK English, or other parts of UK culture, but it SURE IS ANNOYING that you start bringing up things about American-usage words. -.- I don't know what Americans did so wrong!
<weegee2062> knife
<Dovah> http://www.thefreedictionary.com/torch http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flashlight according to that a "torch is not reffered to as a flashlight but a flashlight can be reffered to as a torch.
<cowvarkian> Kurra: we did everything wrong
<RAWRity> Kurra must be new here
<weegee2062> people are really !#@$ed up these days
<Saturn> 08,01i once asked a Welshman if it was true that they shoved the sheep's back feet into their wellies to stop them getting away
<Dovah> Nevermind, i scrolled down :P
<twilight_sprinkle> its clarity vs old tradition of words. i go for clarity
<Saturn> 08,01he looked at me aghast, and said "of course not! then how would we kiss 'em?"
<Sumica> 00,10i agree with the football thought, i think hand egg is funny.
<oni_link> hand egg XD
<cowvarkian> Saturn: >.> not sure if serious or just being an asshat scot
<cachi01> hand egg LOLXD
<twilight_sprinkle> hand egg would be fine with me if thats what they called it :D
<weegee2062> window
<twilight_sprinkle> still, murrican footbal is actually somewhat interesting, has quite a bit of strategy to it
<oni_link> ^
<Sumica> 00,10why do scots wear kilt's. Cause sheep can hear a zipper 3 miles away.
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: its pretty boring
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: i'm just being an assbutt
<weegee2062> EXTERMINATE
<Saturn> 08,01ha!
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: strategy?
<oni_link> Sumica: :D
<cowvarkian> hah
<Saturn> 08,01i'd not heard that one!
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: football is more fun to play
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: murrican football is plain boring
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: when i saw it, i thought it was quite interesting to watch. as for football, i dont like it, imo its boring and half the matches end in 0-0
<weegee2062> give me 1000000000000$
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: yes, strategy.
<weegee2062> da wubs
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: whatever you say, george.
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: yeah im not a fan of football either. but its more fun to play soccer than playing hand egg
<Sumica> 00,10US football was silly a few weeks back when they had to use replacment ref's cause the real ones were on strike
<cowvarkian> cachi01: lolwut hand egg
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: again, not for me
<weegee2062> i want handeggs
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: both are dangerous to play too
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: i got kicked in the nuts so many times in high school football..
<twilight_sprinkle> *shivers*
<oni_link> My friends are Packers fans and they would not shut the hell up >.> I do agree that the whole fiasco is ridiculous though
<Eli> pff she puked...
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: which is why I don't play sports
<Eli> i never puke from throwing up
<weegee2062> eat the money
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: i play tennis, tis a good sport
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: hah, tennis a sport
<weegee2062> dead
<weegee2062> rape
<thelonepony> she OD
<Eli> cowvarkian: ouch. now that just hurts
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: now thats just dumb.
<prince-dari> What do you guys think of rugby then?
<cowvarkian> Eli: well, its a sport as much as table tennis is a sport, and I consider it to be one, so yes, it is a sport
<oni_link> dont they know that theyre supposed to leave them face down?
<twilight_sprinkle> ive never seen a rugby match
<oni_link> death by vomit
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: was just playing the role of the dumb american
<Eli> cowvarkian: you have obviously never played real tennis then
<Sumica> 00,10never watched enough Rugby to figure out the rules
<cowvarkian> Eli: Not very well
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: no youre just being ignorant, tennis is actually very popular in america
<weegee2062> i have the ball hit me in the head
<Sumica> 00,10most games look like a moshpit
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle is right
<Eli> cowvarkian: and fuck it's exshaustin
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: didn't I convey the message that I actually think that tennis is a sport
<prince-dari> Rugby has some weird rules, you get the feeling that the players don't know half of them
<prince-dari> The main one is just don't pass backwards.
<prince-dari> That's pretty much all you need to know
<prince-dari> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: you did, and now im saying youre wrong about americans being like that.
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: heh... ok
<weegee2062> um...k
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: what about no murder
<oni_link> those were some weird shoes
<Sumica> 00,10so it's ice hocky minus the ice and sticks
<weegee2062> wanker realy
<Eli> cowvarkian: now you're just trollin... human rights are usually in the rules included
<prince-dari> Hah, I guess so Sumica
<cowvarkian> Eli: its rugby though...
<Eli> cowvarkian: -.(\
<cowvarkian> Eli: Yes, I know
<Sumica> 00,10I used to be in to hocky till they cancled it for like 3 years due to a strike
<cowvarkian> well, this is amusing me quite well...
<Dovah> .
<twilight_sprinkle> ,
<Arcane> oni_link did the other pokemon player leave?
<weegee2062> one ring to rule them all
<cowvarkian> one ring to find them
<oni_link> Arcane: i dont think so
<oni_link> Im not much of a sports fan in general but I think Hockey and American Football (hand egg) would be fun to watch
<weegee2062> oen ring to umm.. make muffins
<prince-dari> I tried watching American Football once
<Arcane> KK bb
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: did you die?
<prince-dari> It would have been fine except they stopped every 2 minutes
<weegee2062> i ate it
<Sumica> 00,10they have to leave time for advertisments
<prince-dari> Might have been because it was the Superbowl, but they played 2 minutes, then talked for 2 minutes at the previous 2 minutes
<Eli> prince-dari: so it's like hokey in switzerland
<oni_link> I think baseball is the most boring sport to watch
<twilight_sprinkle> golf
<weegee2062> taake another car
<cowvarkian> oni_link: I think that ice skating is the most
<oni_link> that was my second choice twilight_sprinkle
<oni_link> cowvarkian: I dont even consider that a sport >.>
<cowvarkian> oni_link: I don't either
<weegee2062> DRUGS:O
<oni_link> cowvarkian: /)
<prince-dari> Well ice skating is more in lin with something like gymnastics
<prince-dari> line*
<RAWRity> prince-dari: that's the basic flow of US football, but it was certainly exacerbated by it being the Super Bowl, since that's usually when coaches take long periods of time to decide on plays.
<oni_link> yup dari, my point exactly
<cowvarkian> oni_link: (/
<weegee2062> what
<weegee2062> WHAt
<cowvarkian> weegee2062: magic
<weegee2062> wut
<Starlight_Phoenix> what show is on the stream?
<prince-dari> Misfits
<cowvarkian> that
<Starlight_Phoenix> Whats it about?
<cowvarkian> Starlight_Phoenix: super powers fucking up peoples lives
<Starlight_Phoenix> like heroes?
<weegee2062> do you belive in magic in a young girls heart
<cowvarkian> Starlight_Phoenix: only much more dark
<cowvarkian> well, sortof
<prince-dari> Much more dark?
<oni_link> weegee2062: D:
<prince-dari> Ehh
<cowvarkian> the characters are just dicks
<cowvarkian> tbh
<prince-dari> I'd say they're just different styles
<Sumica> 00,10how do you get more dark then cuting peoples heads off to get there powers?
<prince-dari> This is more 'real life' people with super powers, somehow.
<prince-dari> That's how I see it anyway
<cowvarkian> Sumica: meh, different styles
<Sumica> 00,10so heros with out genre savvy
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: dark isnt always gore though
<Buytoast> this still british heroes?
<Eli> we should watch Rocknrolla
<Sumica> 00,10we already have
<cowvarkian> Sumica: maybe instead of more dark, just "everyones an asshat"
<Saturn> 08,01btw
<Shamroc> oh my so much de-sync between sounds and show Saturn..
<Starlight_Phoenix> so he has the power of hindsight?
<cowvarkian> Starlight_Phoenix: basicly
<Sumica> 00,10rocknrolla was wreks pick for the birthday specal thing we did for luna and him
<weegee2062> both :D
<cowvarkian> guy in black jacket... best description ever
