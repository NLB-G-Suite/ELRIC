<Xaiden> LOL
<hen3ry> CriticKitten: because sexy creepy
<Shamroc> Saturn: didnt know you were into that stuff

<Eulshy> I gave that bitch a truck, bitches love trucks
<operatorpony2> buffering
<Fou_Lou> why does the left thing explode oO?
<Xaiden> Nittany_Discord: No really? I couldn't tell
<CriticKitten> Michael Bay was like "OH GOD THAT WAS HOT"
<Sapphire_Breeze> yes

<CriticKitten> lol
<SirGanjalf> :D
<operatorpony2> Kinky
<Method_Fish> I lied
<CriticKitten> Pwned
<otakon> dat bend
<Eulshy> lies
<Kipkat07_USAF> dat bttf scene reference
<otakon> well, that's new
<CriticKitten> ....um.
<Marx> It bulled a Buford.
<Xaiden> Is that a reference to that movie where he said he would kill that one person last?
<CriticKitten> Wait.
<operatorpony2> sEXY ROBOT
<AdamTheDuck> lies everywhere...
<CriticKitten> This is the NEW model right?
<operatorpony2> Id have sex with it
<otakon> Xaiden: don't think so
<SirGanjalf> yep
<Eulshy> Real metal plus liquid metal
<GarettBrony> Kipkat07_USAF which scene
<Kipkat07_USAF> Xaiden: yay!! you figured it out
<otakon> operatorpony2: it would kill you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't catch the anon's IP.
<Marx> Yep. Appears to be a T1000.
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: yep
<Kipkat07_USAF> GarettBrony: the deleted one
<GabeMoist> Ahnold!
<Xaiden> ARNIE IT'S ME JOHN
<Marx> I'll get the Ice Beam.
<Tassadork> thought this one was a T-X
<otakon> Eulshy: basically think T-1000 over a T-800 chassis
<CriticKitten> Why is the new model using a metal skeleton when the last model's all-liquid-metal structure is CLEARLY superior?
<Xaiden> Happy reunion time!!!
<Sapphire_Breeze> no
<otakon> Tassadork: that is T-X
<Tovler> or seduced me?
<SirGanjalf> NO.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chatzilla's /ban does IP, then nick if the IP isn't there.
<Xaiden> Eeeeeyup POOOOW
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Fou_Lou> Marx: nope. seems to be a mix between a normal metal skeletton and a t-1000
<operatorpony2> no
<Ponies47> Here we go agian
<Eulshy> Fank celestia he dun die
<SirGanjalf> Why this scene is so funny?
<otakon> CriticKitten: because it can make weapons bc of it's endoskeleton, best of both worlds.
<SirGanjalf> NAOW
<operatorpony2> they should SPAM termiantors to the past tio zerg rush John
<otakon> like that
<Eulshy> oh gof
<CriticKitten> .....oh.
<otakon> ouchie
<ponibas> ohcrap
<Eulshy> that pulse shot
<CriticKitten> Okay, that seems legit.
<SirGanjalf> ouch
<Vinco> Hooray for physics
<Sapphire_Breeze> we should watch back to the future some time
<Barbetos> Okay bye everyone. Going to do some karaoke with friend
<otakon> THAT is why it's not just a T-1000
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She has wepon
<otakon> bye Barbetos have fun!
<Obsidian> Sapphire_Breeze: We did
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: she IS weapon
<Whiskra> why did they keep reprogramming inferior terminatiors to protect the ones who needed to live?
<BRONY_4_LIFE> awsome
<Saturn> 08,01WEPON
<ponibas> no cop notices trcuk drive by with no door
<ponibas> legit
<Xaiden> If her arm could do that, getting a hand job from her would be wonderous
<otakon> Whiskra: only one's they could get ahold of
<Sapphire_Breeze> Obsidian: when
<CriticKitten> ....
<Kandarihu> Maybe they can't hack the better Terminators.
<Fou_Lou> Whiskra: because it hard to come by good terminators
<AdamTheDuck> Xaiden lolwut
<CriticKitten> And no one notices this girl?
<Obsidian> Sapphire_Breeze: Earlier
<CriticKitten> Seriously?
<operatorpony2> Xaiden: I hope she would stick her pinkie.. or more up there
<Sapphire_Breeze> ahhhh
<Eulshy> key finger
<otakon> Kandarihu: T-X was new, only one made
<ponibas> i think i've seen this effect in Fast and the Furious
<CriticKitten> ....she's....hacking the car....?
<otakon> CriticKitten: the police computer
<GarettBrony> she must be calling the CW
<Ponies47> My mom says I should shut off my computer. NEVER -_-
<Eulshy> oh god she told the robot
<otakon> and cellphone is is done
<Obsidian> Damn you At&T
<Xaiden> Ahhhh shit the Lady Bitch found her
<Sapphire_Breeze> lol
<otakon> DAMN YOU VERIZON!
<operatorpony2> LOL brick cell phone
<operatorpony2> Nokia
<CriticKitten> ....
<CriticKitten> Uh.
<otakon> okay HOW did she do that?
<CriticKitten> Wat.
<Kandarihu> I mean, taking out a T-800's main CPU and modifying it makes sense. The T-1000 is one distributed computer. If the T-X is one of a kind and on Skynet's side, it's kind of out of reach.
<hen3ry> hax
<Sumica> 00,10autobots roll out
<CriticKitten> That's kind of not possible.
<TrixieMuffin> thats not how cars work
<ponibas> Barricade and
<SirGanjalf> Now that's a stealthy vehicle...
<ponibas> damn u Sumica
<JESmith71> Hey Sumica, since SuperBrony showed the BttF ride at Universal, do you think you could show the T2 show (Or maybe just the Cyberdyne commerical that played at the preshow?)
<GarettBrony> Mr Freeze!
<Sapphire_Breeze> now he wakes up
<Xaiden> Okay, I said before that the Terminator from the Second movie was cheap, but dat car shit is just plain unfair
<CriticKitten> THIS NEW ROBOT IS THE MASTER OF STEALTH AND SUBTLETY
<otakon> Kandarihu: eeyup, the official comics had a "test" for the T-X where it fought a T-1000 to the death
<Eulshy> DON"T FORGET SEXYNESS
<Saturn> 08,01this film sure moves slowly...
<Sapphire_Breeze> get off
<otakon> at least he didn't kill him
<GarettBrony> Xaiden at least T2 was good
<operatorpony2> dat shotgun
<killerpony7733> Saturn: Yeah T3 was a bit good at drawing things out
<otakon> it's a slow burn
<Sumica> 00,10nice driveing
<Xaiden> SHADDUP
<Xaiden> SLAM
<ponibas> oops
<otakon> damn
<Marx> Now look what you made him do!
<Saturn> 08,01car stopped
<Sumica> 00,10why you stop at green light
<ponibas> shot him!
<Kandarihu> Distracted Driving can be deadly
<otakon> drive goddammit
<ponibas> shoot hhiiiimmmm
<Tovler> Cursing for dummies, it seems.
<otakon> oh goddammit
<otakon> and then THIS HAPPENS
<otakon> wait for it
<Xaiden> No one in them
<CriticKitten> .....
<otakon> there it is
<Eulshy> oh god
<Whiskra> dont give a damn about his car
<ponibas> hahahahahaha
<tigher1001> dem 8-bit ponys
<Sumica> 00,10sorry it was the smalliest tow truck we had
<otakon> :)
<Eulshy> she has optimus at her disposal
<Kandarihu> Whiskra, it's not his car. It belongs to the company that he works for.
<Kandarihu> It's his livelyhood.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tag team.
<otakon> brb laundry check
<Sumica> 00,10pinball, go for the highscore
<Eulshy> og fuck
<CriticKitten> This entire sequence CAN'T HAPPEN. Cars don't work that way. :|
<Xaiden> Dayum
<operatorpony2> FLeur is ditracting my viewing...
<Eulshy> samich
<Xaiden> DAYUM
<CriticKitten> SO STEALTHY
<tigher1001> WHAT THE HELL
<ponibas> we know... willing suspensioni of deisbelief
<Method_Fish> That destruction

<Petrified_Discord> What if Fleur is sexy robot from the future sent to kill us? :O
<CriticKitten> THIS ROBOT IS SO STEALTHY
<Obsidian> Of couse she hits gas canisters
<tigher1001> what is this movie
<Sumica> 00,10CriticKitten you think it gives a shit about stealth?
<Tovler> what of the odds of the explosion truck being their?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cars can't be controlled be machines.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, yeah.
<GarettBrony> ponibas I dont think i'm willing to suspend my disbelief anylonger
<Eulshy> break EVERYTHING
<GabeMoist> This is a sneaking mission
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even the way this lady did it.
<Xaiden> I've done more damage in GTA IV in like 5 minutes, this is notin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She'd have to build a way to steer the cars.
<CriticKitten> Sumica: It kind of should, since that's its primary function. The robots were designed to look human to blend in with them, remember? >_>
<tigher1001> what movie is this
<Method_Fish> T3
<Xaiden> tigher1001: Terminator 3
<operatorpony2> Nittany_Discord: modern vehilces have aCPU
<Xaiden> Dat hook slap
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Otherwise they could just cover a TANK in human skin and send that back.
<Tovler> this city made of cardboard and explodium
<Sumica> 00,10primay mission is to kill him I think that over rides blend in with target in sight
<Kandarihu> Well, it's doing a great job of blending in, isn't it? >_>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But not automated steering.
<tigher1001> ohh in that case ima leav cause i dont want spoilers
<hen3ry> suddenly residential
<Kandarihu> Sumica, good point
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: That is a vferyu very disturbing mental image.
<Xaiden> CriticKitten: That would be interesting, human tank
<GabeMoist> squee
<Whiskra> toot
<Sapphire_Breeze> sqee
<Petrified_Discord> Damn that truck has horsepower.
<Sapphire_Breeze> yay

<Xaiden> Dat grab
<Obsidian> Yay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumi
<SirGanjalf> Tank covered by human skin? eww
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Difference is that in T1, Arnold generally wasn't trying to make himself public. This one gives zero fucks.
<Sumica> 00,10I think they gave up the liveing tissue bit with t2
<otakon> SirGanjalf: yeah ew
<Xaiden> He gone
<Whiskra> donk
<Eulshy> oof
<Major> splat
<Sapphire_Breeze> lol
<Obsidian> Ohi
<otakon> Sumica: yeah good point, HOW did the T-X and the T-1000 get through?
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: Doesnt really matter because she can change look at will.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> hahahha
<otakon> DUELING VEHICLES!
<Xaiden> Dat Driving skill
<Saturn> 08,01this film is very comical
<Petrified_Discord> Oh than you Ahnold.
<BRONY_4_LIFE> t3 is 20% cooler now
<GabeMoist> geddout
<SirGanjalf> Don't worry, it's me Arnold.
<otakon> Saturn: you haven't seen anything yet.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Arnie has a big car now.
<Sumica> 00,10teamkilling bitch
<operatorpony2> god his lines are horrible, so is his acting
<Kandarihu> This movie isn't very dialog heavy, I notice.
<Xaiden> she teamkills 1 more time, it's a ban
<Xaiden> XD
<pony_5433> needs more rainbow dash
<otakon> okay, just how UNSTOPPABLE is a truck like that?
<Eulshy> dance pony
<Obsidian> operatorpony2: And yet we will still watch him
<Whiskra> its a miracle that lady in the back is not half dead yet at the very least
<GarettBrony> i think arnold is compensating so for something
<Xaiden> otakon: Pretty bucking unstoppable
<operatorpony2> Obsidian: he is/was atotla Dbag ofa govinator
<GarettBrony> jaguar noise
<otakon> GarettBrony: he's got muscles bigger than you head, not likely
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I heard a jaguar.
<Sumica> 00,10he axed her to let him drive
<Eulshy> dance pony dance
<CriticKitten> For_Lou: All the same, this is sort of against her design protocols. :P
<Xaiden> did anyone just hear a cougar?
<Marx> So have they explained why these Terminators exist? Ah heck, this is already potential for a new timeloop.

<SirGanjalf> They programmed him to use cheesy one-liners?
<Tovler> OOOOOOO
<otakon> ASK THE MYTHBUSTERS TIME!
<Obsidian> Screw Phisics
<Dashite> Dat CGI
<GarettBrony> otakon well it sure looks like it
<CriticKitten> That....but....
<Kencolt> GUess she got hung up.
<Sapphire_Breeze> t2 was was better
<Sumica> 00,10he is the "t1t S"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They admitted that more parts flew from that truck than existed on the truck.
<Xaiden> SirGanjalf: Guess 13 year old John taught Future John somethign
<CriticKitten> That cable can't POSSIBLY be that strong. ._.
<Eulshy> t0 was best
<GarettBrony> Sapphire_Breeze you said it
<Kandarihu> Marx, yes
<Sumica> 00,10the snark model
<operatorpony2> Her outit is terrible
<Marx> So after breaking everything and alerting the military...
<CriticKitten> ....
<otakon> GarettBrony: he was Mr. Universe back in the day. and from exercise NOT steroids.
<Petrified_Discord> Alright. Time to blend in.
<CriticKitten> >grabs head forcibly to check for brain trauma
<CriticKitten> Yep!
<Eulshy> now you feel like a douche

<GarettBrony> otakon I know that I was just making a joke
<Xaiden> Unable to comply with bitchy backseat drivers
<hen3ry> 405 freeway. No traffic. Hax.
<CriticKitten> So this model is designed with the exact same appearance on every single robot.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> oh i get it cause he cant self terminate
<otakon> GarettBrony: ah
<CriticKitten> Think about that for a second.
<SirGanjalf> dat desert
<operatorpony2> hen3ry: the interent is down thats why
<otakon> and she did that for 50 miles
<Tovler> yep, she's gonna in this whole movie.
<CriticKitten> It means the primary goal of "blend in with humans" is STUPID.
<otakon> Secondary targets
<Eulshy> The pony dances again, it is fun to watch
<operatorpony2> the ymake babies
<CriticKitten> Because they look the same damnit. ._.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They located him the last two times.
<Kandarihu> Except that the model is played by a human actor who is aging.

<Phase4> 00,02bit to dubstep for me but i like the rest of it
<ducky> k i am out of game
<prince-dari> Ah, that's good alexxm
<Kandarihu> Good morning, prince-dari
<BlazeAngel> prince-dari, say, May I ask you, Phase4 is a bit busy.
<Cypresswolf> more heavy rain coming in the next 30-45 minutes
<Bronysith> Cypresswolf: that is a good game/movie
<ducky> oh the ps3 game
<Bronysith> suddenly r34 pic lol
<Cypresswolf> That'd be the perfect game to play right now :) but I dont have it
<Bronysith> WHO SAW that sublimal r34 pic?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wat?
<sub06905> ?
<ducky> your right but i dont have a ps3 :D
<BlazeAngel> prince-dari, May I ask you a question?
<Bronysith> BlazeAngel: you just did
<prince-dari> Go aheaad
<prince-dari> ahead*
<BlazeAngel> Shaddup Bronysith.
<Cypresswolf> *uses mind to manifest game from nothing* - ow...my head :(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SFM confuses me
<BlazeAngel> prince-dari: What feelings do you get whilest streaming? Stuff like anxiety?
<alexxm> what is SFm Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<prince-dari> Nah, it's more like "Chat reactions, make them cry, trololol"
<prince-dari> <:
<ducky> i think sorce film maker
<BlazeAngel> prince-dari Well, okay. Anything else?
<prince-dari> I don't really get what you want me to say?
<alexxm> thanks ducky
<Cypresswolf> -_(\ that accomplished nothing but pain
<prince-dari> I enjoy streaming, I like to share shows that I enjoy with others
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alexxm: Source Film Maker
<alexxm> thanks Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<prince-dari> It doesn't make me feel anxious, why would it?
<BlazeAngel> prince-dari, Fine, new question. What in the name of god is going to happen when this place gets deserted.
<sub06905> prince-dari: you planning to stream G3 live agian if someone asks for ponies when you stream?
<Bronysith> im going to go to toys r us sometime to buy some pony toys
<Bronysith> just ask "Hey where are the pony toys?"
<Phase4> 00,02so whatya think?
<Phase4> 00,02masterpiece eh
<alexxm> Bronysith make sure not to bring any spaghetti
<Sylandest> Phase4: a blessing from the gods
<Phase4> 00,02lets see if i cant find where these models are
<Barbetos|Atwork> Phase4 what did you replace the gun with?
<sub06905> Phase4: u deserve an emmy
<Phase4> 00,02Barbetos|Atwork, error
<Barbetos|Atwork> lol You should replace it with a pony Phase4
<BlazeAngel> Would anyone play TF2 with me? :3
<BlazeAngel> Or maybe some GMOD?
<ducky> Phase4 can you replace the heavy whit a pony ?
<Cypresswolf> Storm in like you own the place and demand they take you to the ponies or you'll Friendship them so hard, they won't ever look at magic the same way :[
<prince-dari> BlazeAngel: What do you mean when it gets deserted? Everything ends at some point, and so will the site, but I don't really understand your question, when the site shuts down, it shuts down, people would still be able to join this chat room, but if it's 'deserted', there wouldn't be anyone here anyway
<Phase4> 00,02ducky, i dont know
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: you should do a reversal role with the Minigun and Heavy
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<BlazeAngel> Damnit prince-dari, I was asking a question, not starting a debate! ;(
<sub06905> and you shall call it Meet Sasha
<ducky> i like that idea Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<prince-dari> I don't understand your question.
<Cypresswolf> I mean the toy stores - of course :) (>_>)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: and replace all the ppl with guns too in the background :3
<prince-dari> When it's deserted, it's deserted, nothing happens
<XAX> sub0609: that would be funny.
<BlazeAngel> prince-dari: Simple, what will you do in your spare time on the internet when this place dies/
<sub06905> :$
<prince-dari> Oh, me personally.
<Cypresswolf> rain's picking up again -_- yay
<prince-dari> I don't know, rattle around the internet as I always have. :P

<Phase4> 00,02i'm tired if you cant tell
<oni_link> Bronysith: thats my mentality with games
<oni_link> Phase4: i would be too
<Bronysith> oni_link: those who disagree with that rule are false gamers and should not be playing
<Cypresswolf> Amen! to that Bronysith
<ducky> BlazeAngel i am ready
<Sylandest> Phase4: id say you've earned your rest, if you desire it
<BlazeAngel> ducky: I need a min.

<sub06905> needs moar pinkie
<Cypresswolf> Sell incomplete video games *coughFABLEcough*
<oni_link> Bronysith: my friends are Xbox fanboys and when they see me play TF2, they talk crap. they also ask why it doesnt regenerate. I want to slap them in the back of the head when they downtalk games based on looks and what is not in the norm. also, they talk crap when i play older games (8bit era, etc.)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> lol i turned on 'this is war' song just as all the derpyus appeared
<Bronysith> oni_link: but older games are the best ones! super mario bros is one of my fav games of all time
<oni_link> whoa, flight of the bumble derps
<ducky> derp
<Sylandest> XD
<sub06905> health regeneration? why not just ask for ammo regeneration
<MadSurge> oni_link, my hat goes to you sir :F
<Sylandest> I can't hold all this derpy
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> song: TO FIIIIIIIIGH -and then all the derpys appeared
<Crono_Brony> Mother of celestia... so many derpys.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> *fight
<oni_link> Bronysith: I know right? I just dont know why they dont get it.
<Cypresswolf> Inb4 Derpy crashes stream
<sub06905> http://i1100.photobucket.com/albums/g404/sub06905/177pinkies.png
<MadSurge> SO MANY DERPY :D
<oni_link> And thanks MadSurge. to what do i owe this pleasure?
<Bronysith> oni_link: i used to think if it was non realistic and poor graphics. the game sucked. then i played final fantasy 7
<StinkomanFan> ALL THE DERPY
<Bronysith> oni_link: that is when my entire thing on gaming changed forever
<MadSurge> For talking about old timey shooters where you couldn't pussy out your way by hiding
<Bronysith> TO DEUS EX
<oni_link> MadSurge: to the classics! * raises glass*
<Phase4> 00,02:<

<Crono_Brony> DEAR GOD... 2000 DERPIES... THAT WOULD BE EPIC
<oni_link> Bronysith: mmm FF7. I honestly had a revelation when I played Castlevania 3.
<MadSurge> Do 1000 Dashes then :D
<alexxm> how many ponies do they let you have on screan at once
<ducky> Phase4 then not over 9000 ponys
<sub06905> 1000 sonic rainbooms
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah
<Bronysith> oni_link: but ff7 had horrible graphics but great game overall
<Phase4> 00,02i havent installed the vb component
<Phase4> 00,02because screw vb
<Bronysith> oni_link: btw i am playing deus ex right now. horrible graphics as well but a great game
<Cypresswolf> I want to get a super computer, install desktop ponies, then keep adding more until it crashes just to see how much pony it can handle
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, there are a lot of graphics mods
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: it still won't be enough ponies :D
<Phase4> 00,02dx11 renderer that looks good + new models and textures should work well
<Cypresswolf> :) Nope
<Crono_Brony> Cypresswolf: it could probably handle about... 10 of everypony. XD
<oni_link> Bronysith: Yeah, I can see that but i guess it never bothered me that it didnt look so good. also I havent played Deus Ex.
<Phase4> 00,02Cypresswolf, my pc is limited by the softwares efficency
<Phase4> 00,02which is very poor
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 gldesktopponies

<Lil_B> ha... ha... ha.... Sarcasm...
<Sundaysmile> indeed
<Sundaysmile> even MacGuyver looks young
<alexxm> conviently earth like
<Eulshy> lights
<Liokin> Sumica: Yup. Im not sure on time wise. But i've been here for awhile now -lol
<Eulshy> Marines
<Barbetos|Atwork> Back sides?

<SimGretina> This reminds me of Red Alert
<SimGretina> ʸᵃʸ﻿
<ImmaPonyLuvr> what movie is this?
<Lil_B> Not the Military!!!!!!
<Barbetos|Atwork> He wants a full on front side service!
<Alchemist> Richard Dean Anderson got really fat I heard.
<Eulshy> STARGATE, what is stargate?
<Lil_B> Everything but the Military!!! They do everything wrong!!!
<Sundaysmile> Cover 360 degree angles!
<Liokin> Sumica: You've already seen the ending and everything right? you mean finish it over stream?
<appledash6> what's this movie called and about?
<Barbetos|Atwork> Eulshy its a fence.
<prince-dari> I've never seen a lot of these early eps
<Sundaysmile> Fire EVERYWHERE!
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Liokin
<appledash6> 6_9
<Barbetos|Atwork> Shaped like a star.
<Eulshy> Now, i'm preety sure it's a gate
<Sumica> 00,10also want to see the "new" ending
<ImmaPonyLuvr> duh duh duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Eulshy> But i've never seen this before
<SimGretina> it looks so reeeeal
<Liokin> Sumica: Ok, -lol I wanna hear what nittany has to say about the ending when you finish it. Should be good for a few lawls
<Sumica> 00,10the early eps are good dari
<Eulshy> or heard of stargate
<SimGretina> :I
<Lil_B> I would like to know what kind of Material this actually is
<Saturn> 08,01ah, season 1
<Saturn> 08,01where all the music was actually done on real instruments
<SimGretina> stand back i'm going to try science
<Saturn> 08,01this is one thing i hate about the times we live in
<Eulshy> scinece
<Sundaysmile> when they had a good budget for a tv show
<Sumica> 00,10ah a new top 10 vido
<ImmaPonyLuvr> anypony here a girl? ^.^
<Sumica> 00,10I will have to look at that later
<ducky> yay i love the new EQD post
<Exowave1> I don't know what we're watching...
<Eulshy> I wish
<Sundaysmile> Stargate SG1
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Stargate?
<Saturn> 08,01it's so much cheaper to use synth orchestras now that hardly anything, even relatively big budget series, use real orchestras anymore
<Exowave1> Oh, thanks.
<Saturn> 08,01it's such a shame
<Alchemist> wow, he really let himself go: http://derpy.me/9TGIQ
<Saturn> 08,01because you lose so much
<Lil_B> question... why is this stargate on this Planet in the Middle of Nowhere?
<ImmaPonyLuvr> this is scary D:
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it's a shame Saturn
<ImmaPonyLuvr> lol
<pony_8326> alguien que hable español?
<Alchemist> Saturn: I think even Hans Zimmer uses synthetics
<Saturn> 08,01ImmaPonyLuvr: 80% of the scariness is the music, i think
<Sumica> 00,10so much is invested in sound that peole often over look it
<SimGretina> boom
<Saturn> 08,01and with a synth orchestra you jsut wouldn't get that
<ImmaPonyLuvr> @Saturn yeh ur right XD
<Liokin> Alchemist: Sheesh the after years werent great for him. :/
<Saturn> 08,01which is why i realyl, really hope that if there's ever an MLP film, it'll have a real orchestra
<Sumica> 00,10ever seen any of the voice off pony eps Saturn?
<Sundaysmile> almost sounded like the music from predator
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: i haven't, actually
<SimGretina> they're actors
<SimGretina> omg
<ImmaPonyLuvr> they should put night vison gogles on the carma so we can c everything XD
<Eulshy> i really doubt it will have one
<Sumica> 00,10You should check them out some time
<Sundaysmile> real orchestra plus MLP songs
<SimGretina> Stargåte
<Sumica> 00,10it's amazing how much sound work they put in the show
<Saturn> 08,01Sundaysmile: next semester, i'm going to see if i can call in a favour with an orchestra i'm involved with and have them play somethign pony
<ImmaPonyLuvr> @Sumica yeh its so awesome! but nothing can beat the muisc in mlp
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> so Dark
<Sundaysmile> Set up a recording session for that one
<Saturn> 08,01i will
<Sumica> 00,10I was talking about the music in Mlp ImmaPonyLuvr
<Sylandest> Saturn: that would be awesome
<ImmaPonyLuvr> oh lol fail
<Saturn> 08,01i do audio engineering, so that was the plan
<Lil_B> Saturn I recently found outn that the Guy who makes the opening orchestration son some of the MLP Episodes, also makes the Backgroundmusic for Poun Puppies, but he isn't credited in MLP
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i presume you're not talking abotu William Anderson?

<ImmaPonyLuvr> you should play minecraft with the pony mod!
<RD36> minecraft!
<Eulshy> Terraria
<MadSurge> Watch out for the Reapers!
<derpy_pony> you should play dwarf fortress...it's like sims, but every few days some clay golem or dragon or whatnot attacks your sim house...and you can weaponize everything ^^
<OMB|Brinstar> That sounds like fun
<ImmaPonyLuvr> derpy_pony: awesome XD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> dem Reapers
<Chrysalis> ohai ME
<derpy_pony> the only drawback is that the gui is...rudimentary at best
<Dark_Horst> i tried dwarf fortress. they're not big on beginner's help
<OMB|Brinstar> lol
<derpy_pony> nope
<Dark_Horst> also, i couldn find a texture pack i liked
<derpy_pony> but there are youtube tutorials now
<derpy_pony> I prefer pure ascii
<Barbetos|Atwork> Ugh whats wrong with his face!?
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6158504192

*Chrysalis cuddles MadCanary
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: you know we will
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ND|Nap you are seeing maids in your sleep ?
<Chrysalis> TheGreatAndPowerfulT you sound supprised
<ND|Nap> 11,01No maids.
<MadCanary> It wont help. It wont bring him back to me.
<Liokin> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: They could probaby just like splash some water on me or throw a clump of dirt to reveal me. But no. go for the jarate :<
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis oh god i can transmit sound on internet chat ? i'm going to be rich ...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis :p
*Liokin dusts ND|Nap

<Xaiden> This guy needs to give me lessons...

<Litwick> MadCanary, if he treated you like that, he doesnt DESERVE you.
<Meanwhile> A pony probably.
<Chrysalis> ND|Nap unknown atm
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> MadCanary needs more hugs
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT hugs MadCanary

<MadCanary> He treated me like an angel.
<MadCanary> But then camp started.
<Liokin> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: :<
<Pudge> So how long have you all been here?
*Liokin hugs MadCanary
<Litwick> Meant to say if he ended the relationship like that. Cant fucking stand cheaters.
<MadCanary> He didnt cheat.
<MadCanary> He's very trustworthy. Always kept his word, never bullshitted.
<killerpony7733> Pudge: I think since sometime in 2011 i don't remember i became alot more active later past 2011
<Shamroc> Litwick....somthing is telling me you arnt really helping..
<alexxm> i've been here for a few months Pudge
<Dark92Enigma> Hello, everypony

<Shamroc> hello Dark92Enigma
<Xaiden> MadCanary: How long have you to been related? Also, how long have you known him before?
<Pudge> Oh because you all seem to know each other :S
<HatsuneMikuFan> LoGaN: I'll get online now and accept
<Meanwhile> To be frank Shamroc not a lot can help that scenario.
<Dark92Enigma> i missed last night's movies...........
<alexxm> hey Dark92Enigma how have you been
<Chrysalis> pudge were all friends here
<Xaiden> MadCanary: Sorry, I meant together, not related... :$
<Dark92Enigma> because i had SERIOUS TESTS FOR TODAY
<killerpony7733> Pudge: Obviously you get to know people when you have been around enough
<MadCanary> Well...I met him last summer in camp near early August.
<LoGaN> it says im offline but i set it so it says that when i watch mlp HatsuneMikuFan
<alexxm> did they go well Dark92Enigma
<MadCanary> We spoke a lot, got to know each other, and then we got together in April.
<Xaiden> MadCanary: Okay,
<Pudge> Yeah I guess:)
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm yes they did..........did they show NC after the movies?
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: yeah i guess...i just think that brining up memorys...well just seems a little.....well yeah.....

<Dark92Enigma> alexxm The top 11 F*** YEAH Movie themes
<alexxm> i don't know Dark92Enigma i was only here for the back to future movie
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: It's called the try-hard dilema. The harder you try to help the worse you make it.
<Chrysalis> huh, this songs making me sleepy
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm which was awesome, i can tell because i've seen it several times
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> calling it now, he's drawing... a pony
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> :p
<Shamroc> Meanwhile..thats why i woulndt try and make it better...just attempt to make it not get worse
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Ikr
<Xaiden> MadCanary: When you were talking with him between August and April, was it face to face, on a chatroom, video chat, or anything else
<Shamroc> also...song choice...not the best right now..
<Marx> The training instructor in SF64 3D has one heck of a deep voice.
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm do you want to know what's the top F*** yeah movie theme song, or you want me to give you the link?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh Fuuuu.... http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/118421-BioWare-Making-Free-to-Play-Ultima-RPG
<MadCanary> More chatroom than face to face. But then face to face incresased
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma i saw the video but just not on here
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol
<Xaiden> MadCanary: Hmmm... Only thing I can think of right now is that he just wasn't willing to commit to a relationship,
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm you did?? Let's say the top 1 F*** YEAH theme in 3-------2-------1---
<RX-78-SweetieBot> So it'll be f2p but p2w

<Liokin> Shamroc: What you mean "US" I fear no man >:3
<MadCanary> He's terrified Shamroc. NEVER PRESSURED HIM. Never asked this fucker for a ring. Never got jealous.
<killerpony7733> Pudge: That's pretty cool looking
<Meanwhile> MadCanary: Has he any experience?
<zanon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-3wp2VVhKQ
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm In the credits. Between the runner-ups, he tried to mention ''Also Sprach Zarathrustra'' but he said ''2001''......
<Shamroc> zanon: please no video links during a stream
<MadCanary> Meanwhile: He's had gfs in the past, but a while back. Its his first relationship in a while.
<Pudge> killerpony7733: Thanks I gave the design to my friend and he made it for me. :)
<Meanwhile> MadCanary: Any idea how those ended?
<Xaiden> MadCanary: Age is also a factor, if you both are in your early teen years, then you'll need to be patient
<MadCanary> Nope.
<MadCanary> Im 19.
<Pudge> because I lack any sort of artistic talent :$
<MadCanary> So is he
<Xaiden> MadCanary: Ahhh

<zanon> even my pops. i converted them all

<Meanwhile> Overreaction.
<Pudge> zanon: you made your pops a brony?
<Rave|Laptop> :D
<zanon> Aye and my mother.
<Pudge> zanon: that's quite a feat. I would never reveal my secret to anyone i know :D
<Pudge> irl that is
<Chrysalis> Shamroc i must disagree, to hurt someone as awesome as Canary
<Chrysalis> a swift end is a fitting punishment
<Meanwhile> I'm inclined to point out that you're blowing hot air Chrysalis.
<Rave|Laptop> Im kind of glad im the only one in my family thats a brony... it makes it "my" thing, lol
<Shamroc> Chrysalis: swift end?
<|Discord|> Chrysalis: I swear I have see nyou before...
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile, of course

<zanon> heh i have no shame of what i like heck even my brother and his kids, slowly converted em all. showing them the music, the show n art and at the same time showing them the meaning. ^.^

<Pudge> zanon: if my friends found out I probably wouldnt have friends anymore :'(
<thegt90> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5548/
<zanon> but then nothing beats sitting down with your children and watch a show you all like
<Liokin> killerpony7733: -lol same as always.
<|Discord|> Pudge: Then they are not your friends, real friends like you for who you are
<HatsuneMikuFan> Pudge: True friends wounld not judge on what you like
<HatsuneMikuFan> would*
<Pudge> idk maybe i'm just paranoid
<|Discord|> Pudge: I know that feel bro.
<zanon> well maybe my age. right now im in a phase where all that matters is what my wife thinks of me.
<ECP48> Is Wrek still at it?
<|Discord|> ECP48: Eeeyup

<Kandarihu> Alright, it's done. I have Terraria.
<Reikim> Hm
*Reikim claps
<Reikim> Congrats
<Pudge> I think I'll go download that
<Pudge> its only 4 bucks
<Derpy_Hooves> Wrek
<Marx> Sounds goos Kandarihu. That game is pretty good.
<Marx> good*
<Reikim> Four bucks. That's a deal and a half.
<tehepicbrony> i has minecraft so me no need it
<Reikim> Lies
<Barbetos> Ello
<Pudge> minecraft isnt on steam is it?
<Wrek> 05em pings
<Reikim> Minecraft and Terraria are different experiences.
<Derpy_Hooves> Wrek
<Kandarihu> Terraria is $2.49
<Barbetos> Yes!
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Rarity or Twilight
<Marx> I have Minecraft AND Terraria.
<Barbetos> Oh! that reminds me!
<Barbetos> I could get a new server up for Terraria potentially.
<Derpy_Hooves> Wrek: i forgot what ponies you chose :I
<Fou_Lou> Will there be a movie on Stream somtime tonight?
<Derpy_Hooves> again
<tehepicbrony> no minecraft can be downloded at minecraft.net
<Wrek> 05read the hostory on skype
<Barbetos> It could be the bronystate terraria server, if you think you guys would want it.
<Derpy_Hooves> okay~
<Wrek> 05it has a function for that
<Pudge> Fou_Lou: Shizuka said she MIGHT stream salvation
<Reikim> Minecraft is about creepers being an ass while you try to shelter from everything. Terraria is a bit bigger on exploration than building.
<thegt90> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5381/
<Fou_Lou> Pudge: anything on when?
<Pudge> no
<ND|Nap> 11,01Barbetos: Cool.

<Pudge> PORTAL 2 IS 5 BUCKS
<Kandarihu> Is there a limit of 4 people logged into a server at any one time?
<Fou_Lou> Pudge: Thanks.
<Barbetos> ND|Nap you play Terraria?
<zanon> Ill be back quickly I must help wife or she will smite me
<Reikim> Kandarihu: If it's Terraria, then no.
<ND|Nap> 11,01No, but we could do Bronystate servers.
<Meanwhile> zanon: But smite only works on minions.
<Sumica> 00,10So it's bamby with only one horn right Litwick
<ND|Nap> 11,01I have the game though.
<zanon> after all shes the unicorn of the house. darn magic XD

<Litwick> ITS BAMBI AFTER A HUNTER SAWED OFF ONE OF HIS HORNS.
<Kandarihu> Oh no! They're making an offshoot with the exact name that I was going to give to my meta-scifi epic that I was developing for a while. I guess I'm going to have to find another name for it.
<Reikim> Fou_Lou: Pony Fantasy 6. Is this for real? Because I might just explode.
<tehepicbrony> portal 2
<PonyXCeed> lovely
<Pudge> steam is freezing :(
<Litwick> Thats a badass OC. Whose is it?
<Pudge> but yeah portal 2 fgor 5 bucks

<Kandarihu> It's not like I was calling it Starbound from the beginning, though
<Pudge> STEAL
<Pudge> too bad my computer cant run it
<Jim> that's a steal, but I already have it ^
<Pudge> HEY
<Meanwhile> Wombo combo!
<Jim> that ain't falco
<Pudge> hey what gives
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> CALLING IT its either Colgate or Lyra
<tehepicbrony> i love skyrim but im waiting till dawngurd comes out for pc
<Fou_Lou> Reikim: Sure. Phoe from EQD is doing a lets play on her youtube. And waching someone play grows a desire to play it for myself
<Pudge> i just got kicked for no reason :'(
<PonyXCeed> me to tehepicbrony
<Jim> you sendt more than 6 messages in less than 10 seconds
<Pudge> that was an accident
<Meanwhile> It's an automated response.
<Kandarihu> Man, I'm digging this music from Wrek, but Terraria awaits. Sorry
<Reikim> Fou_Lou: Does it do anything new, or is it just a surface hack?
<Eulshy> hry
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> wait might be Shizuka
<Sumica> 00,10da hell
<Sumica> 00,10wrek are you still on 5 in 10?

<Pudge> tehepicbrony: How
<Kandarihu> Running first launch
<tehepicbrony> mai friends ps2 dosent work so he hooked me up
<Fou_Lou> Reikim: Im not that into FF6 since i only plaed it as kid on my psx with limied english knowledge. But every character is a pony and the Story is ponified too. and theere seem some game mechanic changes
<Wrek> 05...no
<Pudge> tehepicbrony: did you get FFX?
<Fou_Lou> Reikim: Stronger magic and not all characters are able to learn magic anymore. for example
<Sumica> 00,10odd, wonder why I kicked em right after you did.
<Meanwhile> Sumica: didn't let the timer reset?
<Pudge> Sumica: I'm sorry dont kick me again :'(
<Reikim> Fou_Lou: With or without espers? On that note, how does the esper mechanic work?
<Wrek> 05mfw Pudge didnt realize its automated
<Meanwhile> Sumica: I mean, it's been happening to otakon for months.
<Sumica> 00,10it's a bot Pudge
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<PonyXCeed> gnight

<Rave|Laptop> Random question. How good a game is Terraria? O.o
<Pudge> final fantasy 10
<Derpy_Hooves> Wrek: are you drawing the ten ponies for the project?
<Sumica> 00,10otakon also has crap slow internet.
<Meanwhile> Very true.

<Derpy_Hooves> oh cool
<Sumica> 00,10half the time he spams cause he lags out
<Fou_Lou> Reikim: i have no real idea about that. Espers can only be equipped by unicorn because they can only use magic
<tehepicbrony> one sec...
<Reikim> Fou_Lou: Makes sense enough. The downlaod button on the website won't work for me.
<Derpy_Hooves> Wrek: ok good, i was about to say, the artist cant start til the background is done
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Sumica: then rages and ends up spamming some more :D
<Sumica> 00,10yeah

<Fou_Lou> Reikim: read. you have to klick two links on the left bar. Just the artists and other staff member credits
<Sumica> 00,10it's a good thing we dont use the auto ban part of that script any more
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Silly Filly otakon
<Pudge> tehepicbrony: FFX is the best game on the PS2
<Meanwhile> Sumica: You'd have to unban otakon ten times a night.
<Shizuka> 13who ist the pony on stream
<Reikim> Luna danced crazy!
<Pudge> Sumica: Yeah I woulda been banned on accident
<Jim_> d'aaw so cute

<Ponies47> Sumica: I think it's bacon mane
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> you're probably right Sumica
<Ponies47> *BaconMane
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bronysith: Yesh :3

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Anypony know if the Radeon 7850 is good for gaming?

<Sumica> 00,10nah it's just for word processing
<Meanwhile> But SuperBrony64, you're a casual. You don't belong on there.
<zanon> yerp brony 64
<CriticKitten> o.O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:<
<Meanwhile> You'll be eaten alive.
*Reikim gives Meanwhile a smack upside the head
<Reikim> Fool. How else will he learn?

<xxMoopyxx> ha ha
<Marx> Hehehe. Just changed the track on Mechbeth.
<Lunar_Brony> I need a new computer
<Meanwhile> I like Chess Titans.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I liek Meanwhile :3c
<CriticKitten> Wait, someone mention Terraria? That game's quite a lot of fun, totally worth the deal price atm.
<Sumica> 00,10screw that, real men play extream paint brawl
<Meanwhile> Aww, I like you too SuperBrony64.
*SuperBrony64 hugs Meanwhile
*Meanwhile hugs SuperBrony64 back.
<CriticKitten> Honestly it's worth full price even, so the deal price is REALLY good. >_>
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> from SuperBrony64 's guess the game ost earlier i dont think hes acasual Meanwhile
<Sumica> 00,10I have Terraria, SuperBrony64 gifted it to me then never played with me >_<
<Lunar_Brony> I like Combat Arms *braces himself*
<Reikim> Speaking of Brawl, I finally got my hands on a new copy. WHOOOOO
<Rave|Laptop> Sumica: You can play with others on that game? O.o
<CriticKitten> Daw! I would play with you Sumi, but I'd need to make a new dude. My existing dude has too much phat loot.
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: yeah work it!
<CriticKitten> Rave|Laptop: Yep!
<Sumica> 00,10wait is baconmane still an Alicorn?
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> i'll play terraria with ya sumi
<Rave|Laptop> :O
<Marx> Area 6. Now it gets serious.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I secretly wub Sumica but I could never gain the courage to play games with him...he's too good for me...
<TheHoodyNinja> wth is he saying?
*Sumica hugs SuperBrony64
<Rave|Laptop> Meh, $2.50... cant go wrong with that, i guess ill buy it :P
<AdamTheDuck> is steam summer sale on yet?
<CriticKitten> But SuperBrony64, don't you see....that isn't the way to deal with fears at alllllll?
<Lunar_Brony> Marx my favourite level in Starfox 64
*SuperBrony64 hugs Sumica back O////O
<DJPON3> thinking about playing Cry of Fear...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I don't think laughing at Sumica will help me...
<Sumica> 00,10nah actaly I forgot I had that game, shortly after SB gave it to me one of our cool viewers here gave me Win 7 and I never got around to installing it again.
<Lunar_Brony> SuperBrony64 don't laugh AT Sumica, laugh WITH Sumica
<Reikim> SuperBrony64: The trick is finding the right game. You've got to find a game that Sumi can't play.
<Lunar_Brony> see what I did thar?
<Rave|Laptop> :D
<xxMoopyxx> The song sounds like dragon force
<Sumica> 00,10I am not lauging at you, I am laughing near you.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SEE. It's always about the size of gifts and the amount of money ;A;
<Sumica> 00,10nah super win 7 was just so i could stream better.
<TheHoodyNinja> Lunar_Brony: no :'(
<CriticKitten> SuperBrony64: The trick is to laugh WITH your friends, silly filly. Games are instantly made more fun when played with friends. Two Best Friends, anyone? :3
<DJPON3> CriticKitten YEAH
<ZappyTheUnicorn> CriticKitten: /)
<CriticKitten> (\
<Lunar_Brony> TheHoodyNinja I didn't mean to send that. I reached for the backspace, but this stupid laptop keyboard is stupid and I hit enter
<RaveBrony> Meh, im gonna be on this laptop all night, might as well change my name back :P
<SuperBrony64> 01,04I will destroy those who oppress me o_____o
<Sumica> 00,10god the times when my sound would crap out like 30min before a new pony ep
<Lunar_Brony> SuperBrony64 U mad bro?
<Meanwhile> Dat SuperBrony64 red text.
<Sumica> 00,10I was starting to think pony eps was gonna give me ulcers
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts SuperBrony64
<RaveBrony> O_O
<CriticKitten> Rave|Laptop: Yeah, honestly it's even worth it at full price. For two and a half bucks it's a steal.
<Reikim> SuperBrony64: Untrue, actually. "Value" is an arbitrary measurement. Good hard work can contribute to the value of a piece. I get away with gifting my friends pictures that I spend maybe a couple hours drawing and never inking.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> O_O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Cupcake tiem ^-^

<TheHoodyNinja> all this songs sound the same to me :/
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: You FOOL. Names have POWER.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No DayZ yet.
<xxMoopyxx> Hey djpon3 did you ever make a movie yet?
<RaveBrony> YES!! Finally i get to hardcore watch Wrek draw the eyes! :$
<Vordox> So that's Baconmane?
<Vordox> Looks...mareish

<CriticKitten> Nittany: Wait until it's one of the specials.
<Sumica> 00,10Silly nitt, you should not be looking at steam
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: No, you don't have the right names yet. You'd need one of the Primal Words for that.
<Sumica> 00,10you need to be thinking about fixing PC
<DJPON3> .-.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<CriticKitten> What to vote for a sale next....maybe Trine 2.

<Bronysith> so good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0150% of MW3. That's very rare.
<Lunar_Brony> dayum
<Lunar_Brony> that's good
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: All men have an inkling of the Truth, buried deep within the subconscious under layers and layers of what we call "progress".
<Sumica> 00,10well not sure Lunar_Brony, I presume it's Baconmane as a r63
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: ... nope still dont know
<Bronysith> definetely looks like... did that just blink?!
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> considering the Cutiemark
<Marx> Beat the crap out of Area 6. Now let's see how Star Wolf fares...

<Bronysith> Marx: i loved star fox 64
<xxMoopyxx> Do it again i wasn't looking
<TheHoodyNinja> Lunar_Brony: did you hit your computer with a stick?
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: Buried though it is, there is the smallest kernel of the Primordial in all life, without which we would not exist.

*Meanwhile hugs Nittany_Discord.
<DJPON3> *bit pony game up on EQD, if I remeber correctly...
<xxMoopyxx> what deathklok
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Okay, which variety of hell do you want? The kind written by a Brazilian who has some good ideas but English as a second language, or the one by an American college student who can't tell plot and characterization from Twilight and probably has never seen a grammar book in his life?
<DJPON3> *8Bit

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Get a 30% Trade Bonus at GameStop when you fund your Steam Wallet
<Sumica> 00,10Vash the pony?
<Reikim> Meanwhile: http://derpy.me/B8Bhb This is the one by the Brazilian. I've taken a shot at the first and second chapters, and then there's a run of chapters I can't be bothered to get around to dealing with before I pick up again. And even when I do edits, sometimes the author goes right back in and undoes them, so I'm not entirely sure why I even bother.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Bronysith i could get rid of my xbox games and use them for steam ...
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ahhh okay thats good
<RaveBrony> Rarity! :$
<Sumica> 00,10Rarity the stampeed
<Bronysith> deus ex rarity?
<xxMoopyxx> No dude don't get rid of your xbox man
<CriticKitten> RARITY
<Meanwhile> Sumica: stampede*
<Meanwhile> Dat Trigun.
<Bronysith> xxMoopyxx: it is terrible. pc gaming all the way
<Sumica> 00,10fucks i dont give them Meanwhile. I know you meanwell but yeah.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Reikim> Meanwhile: http://derpy.me/Pbg4X This is the other one. Rampant character derailment and OC Sue-ness abound, enough that I've actually convinced the author to let me go back and retcon sizable portions. I'm still in the middle of it, so after about chapter 8 the badness really kicks in, including an incest rape scene that makes me cringe every time I think of it.
<xxMoopyxx> wow bronysith just wow
<panda> Nittany_Discord :( may i talk to you for a second?
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bronysith: Xbox is good too
<Meanwhile> Sumica: If I stopped correcting people because they didn't care I'd never correct anyone.
*Reikim kicks a wall
<Marx> Alright. I think Star Fox 64 3D is pretty good. It may not be exactly like the original, but it is a good remake.
<Reikim> Dammit why'd I sign up for this.
<Meanwhile> Reikim: Good grief what exactly /did/ you sign up for?
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Betareading. It's complicated.
<Meanwhile> Reikim: Sounds like a headache.
<xxMoopyxx> Yesss this is awesome song the doom songs
<Tassadork> hwagh! just finished conducting SIM surgery...
<Reikim> Meanwhile: The second one gave me control over one of his other stories because his cowriter dropped off the face of the planet. It's the only reason I'm still around.
<Tassadork> http://www.solutios.com/simcutting/
<Reikim> Meanwhile: I still have to argue with him so the OC antagonist doesn't become a Gary Sue.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01panda: 'sup?
<Ponies47> BUCKING COMPUTER! :[
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She should have RARITY!
<Meanwhile> Reikim: Why don't you push a boulder up a mountain, it'll be easier.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> I'll brb in a couple of hours.
<Ponies47> Ok then Zap......:(
<Reikim> Meanwhile: I think I might have a masochistic streak.
<RaveBrony> LEft so wuickly D:
<RaveBrony> *quickly
<Vordox> Lady in Blue?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wut! my internet now actually allow me to have the stream adn download to a decent speed.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and*
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Example: "We'll have the antagonist (who is, by the way, extremely powerful) massacre thousands! And then he'll kidnap the hottest, most powerful girl on the cast! And then she'll fall in love with him! And then he'll turn good (no word on how)! And then he'll live to have many babbies!
*Reikim headdesks, hard
*Meanwhile bangs Reikim's head on the desk.
<Meanwhile> I don't know if I want to ask how you found your way into that, Reikim.
<Reikim> If the story did not have potential I would have quit long ago. As is, I'm planning to hijack it thoroughly.
<Marx> Final Score: N64 Mode, 1367 Hits, Wingmates never downed, 19 extra Arwings, 6 medals earned, earned $87,488.
<xxMoopyxx> Wow really
<Marx> I've gotten over 1500 in the past.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: He's not the one writing it, and the last guy was pretty competent as well. I'm just going to have to hijack the entire thing out from under him.
<Meanwhile> Reikim: for the best really.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Considering his idea of character development had more in common with spontaneous combustion, it's the best thing that could ever happen to the story.
<Meanwhile> Reikim: 7th line first chapter 2nd story, should be marksman.
<Sumica> 00,10oh I go to get a drink and come back to what looks like cute twi reading
<AdamTheDuck> awwwwwwwwwwwww she's so adorable
<RaveBrony> Geez, Wrek, how do you get so good?? :[ Not only with the pictures look, but also the speed!
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Bear in mind, this is one of the ones I got around to fixing. And I did it while half-asleep so as to preserve my sanity.
<RaveBrony> I spend a damn HOUR get the Outline of my pictures done! :D
<RaveBrony> *getting
<Ponies47> I am a terrible artist :s
<AttacktheAndalite> ^
<RaveBrony> I blink and a whole new pic is on the screen, rofl
<Sumica> 00,10RaveBrony, draw all the time is probably what he would tell you.
<Sundaysmile> or read a book
<Reikim> RaveBrony: It's a damn old cliché, but it's the truth. Practice hard, practice often, practice until your fingers hurt.
<Meanwhile> Reikim: This is something to be done in the day, not 1AM.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> practice till ya eyes bleed
<Yahooz> ...ohey Wrek is back ^_^
<Sumica> 00,10Well I have heard people ask wrek the same question enough time I can probably answer most of them for him =p
<RaveBrony> Sumica: More than likely :\ but GOD i give up after 3 hours of getting nothing done! :D
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Skip ahead to Chapter 9 or maybe 10. 1am is the only time I'm able to deal with it.
<RyunosukeKnT> I see Wrek is back! Heya
<RaveBrony> Yepyep
<Tassadork> ahh, holey cow. got a new phone... not realizing it wanted a smaller SIM card than my old one...
<Reikim> Meanwhile: If I still had the original manuscripts I'd show you just how bad it was. I deleted that shit as soon as I could.
<Marx> So will there be any movies or special showings later tonight?
<Meanwhile> Reikim: Some things are best left unsaid.
<Ponies47> I once tryed to draw Pinkie Pie. I WAS AWFUL! D:
<Ponies47> *IT
<RyunosukeKnT> also, I feel my diabetus approaching :)
<Tassadork> but it turns out that you can cut regular sim cards into mini sim cards. so I got scissors. ... and broke my sim card =/
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ponies47 so ?
<Marx> Btw, the streamer is doing good with the drawings.
<Sumica> 00,10smaller sim card? wth would they change simcard size
<Tassadork> because apple decided they wanted it to be smaller, basically
<imnobrony> aj-huh
<Tassadork> and everyone else followed suit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ponies47 you are still better than all the people that don't even try it
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Sorry, sorry, just blowing off steam...anyway, don't feel compelled to actually read it. It's just a relief to have someone who sympathizes, for once.
<Sumica> 00,10odd
<Phase4> 00,02FFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU (summer sale started)
<Ponies47> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: It looked nothing like her. Her mane was just awful.
<Sumica> 00,10oh hi Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02my wallets gona feel this one
<Meanwhile> Reikim: S'all good.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ponies47 again so ?
<Tassadork> so then I cut away even *more* of the card... and it started working in the new phone
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Sumica

<AdamTheDuck> is this the part where we love and tollerate imnobrony?
<Vordox> Oh right you're not a brony but you come here? XD

<Meanwhile> Reikim: Nah check it you have to lift and drop, not swing. It's all in the heave.
<Vordox> So you tbe NOBRONY are not annoying as a brony?
<Vordox> I sense doublestandards
<Wrek> 05there we go

<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> I like traaaaaaiiiins!
<Meanwhile> Thanks Wrek.
<oni_link> imnobrony: hmm... that sounds like one person and youre using that one person to judge a whole group.
*Rain throws the cinderblock at Reikim
<Ramdomguy> then why are you here response to *imnobrony*

<imnobrony> Vordox: BECAUSE THEY NEVER SHUT UP ABOUT THEIR STUPID "PONY" OBSESSIONS
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Rain> hahaha, Wrek
<Rain> ok then
<Reikim> imnobrony: Ponyponypony
*Bronysith licks imnobrony
<Vordox> imnobrony: How much ponies or bronies have we talked about since you came here?
<Yahooz> Do so
<Meanwhile> imnobrony: That's a generalisation.
<Derpy_Hooves> imnobrony: you are totally a brony
<oni_link> hmm... right. we are here talking about steam.
<killerpony7733> imnobrony: and that's all you can use to justify your hate?
<Rain> didnt your mother ever tell you not to play with your food, Wrek?
<Bronysith> imnobrony: ALL HEIL LAUREN FAUST
<Wrek> 05imnobrony: i hate brony haters, casue they never shut up about their brony hating obsessions
<Yahooz> Guys stop feeding the parasprite
<Lasharus> That's nice imnobrony. You're also on a brony chatroom. Somehow there appears to be an error of judgement here. :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> imnobrony live by example and shut up :p
<oni_link> Bronysith: /)
<Vordox> Dat reversel, Wrek :P
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Wrek: I aprove.
<Bronysith> FOR The luna republic!
<Xaiden> What's on the Summer Sale?
<Yahooz> lets Wrek handle this
<Derpy_Hooves> imnobrony: if you hate bronies, why are you here? or are you secretly a brony? :3
<AttacktheAndalite> Lasharus: The troll doesn't know any better.
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Yo, you're the reason we get a bad rep.
<imnobrony> ALL THEY THINK OF IS PONIES!PONIES!PONIES!
<Derpy_Hooves> imnobrony is tottaly a brony
<Bronysith> i think of pie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i think he is a brony ^
<Wrek> 05all they think of is to hate bronies hate bronies hate bronies
<imnobrony> NO SHOW HAS EVER BEEN SO FREAKING POPULAR
<Derpy_Hooves> imnobrony is tottaly a brony
<Vordox> Yeah this guy is not even trying, no effort, Kick him for a few hours, Wrek?
<Reikim> imnobrony: My mind is divided into six segments: one for each of the Mane 6. So I suppose you're right.
<Wrek> 05only 1 show before has been so polular (trekkies)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> seee totally a brony
<Lasharus> But then, I rather suspect your entire existence is an error of judgement imnobrony. I don't go in for all that love and tolerance claptrap. I go in for treating idiots like idiots. You are an idiot, ergo, I will look down upon you. Though I'd need a microscope.
<Vordox> Wrek: Nah, you forgot Star Wars. :P
<oni_link> imnobrony: as an example, we are talking about steam sales at the moment. dont know if youve been paying attention.
<Bronysith> imnobrony: why dont you go ahead and tell us your fav pony
<Wrek> 05ah right
<Derpy_Hooves> imnobrony is a brony just doesnt want to admit it :3
<MahBoi777> sounds like it
<Meanwhile> Strange place to hang out really.
<Bronysith> Derpy_Hooves: we all go through that stage i think
<imnobrony> Bronysith: Well,b4 i turned against it was derpy
<Vordox> Wrek: Before that however...No clue really about any other bigger communities.
<oni_link> Bronysith: *chris hanson's voice* why dont you go ahead and have a seat?
<Xaiden> Why would he waste his time here if he wasn't a brony?
<Derpy_Hooves> imnobrony is a brony just doesnt want to admit it :3
<Vordox> imnobrony: Turned what?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh hai Derpy_Hooves haven't see you in a while :p
<Bronysith> imnobrony: you know who derpy is. therefore you are a brony
<imnobrony> TURNED AGAINST THE PONY REVOLUTION!
<Wrek> 05what i find hilarious is that he foudn this place, which is the least "PNIES IN YOUR FAIC" place of all the fan sites i know :P
<Lil_B> hi everybody
<AttacktheAndalite> Aww, how cute. He's using caps.
<MahBoi777> hi Lil_B!
<Yahooz> bye im
<Reikim> imnobrony: CAN'T STOP THE REVOLUTION BRO. YOU CAN'T STOP PROGRESS.
<TheShadowQuill> Hello, my friends!
<Vordox> Wrek: Well that's cause we're bronies who care. :P
<Bronysith> AttacktheAndalite: not even the royal canterlot voice
<Yahooz> ...to late
<oni_link> Wrek: haha so true. :D
<Lasharus> At any rate, amusing though it is to once again note my mind's superiority to most people like this, I think I'll now proceed to bed.
<Lasharus> G'night guys.

<Reikim> Wrek: All right, hint taken.
<Xaiden> Whiskra: What pony is that? Looks like a Bald Rainbow Dash
<Lil_B> Vordox I finally figured GIMP out I think... but for now I still have one question XD
<Bronysith> hmmmm. should i be playing me2 or deus ex?

<Cypresswolf> Ponies in a heavy snowstorm - There! That's perfect
<Bronysith> oni_link: cause sonic is dead. he was replaced by his retarded cousin
<Reikim> Whiskra: Isn't that a bit morbid?
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> sawnic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek draw rule 63 Nittany_Discord :p
<oni_link> Bronysith: the truth hurts :(
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/wlxME.png .-.

<killerpony7733> Shizuka: Dayum
<Yahooz> dat Shizuka
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Before vacation. He started on it.
<TheShadowQuill> Shizuka: Nice OC
<oni_link> Bronysith: i think generations was a step in the right direction though
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/dmTJp.jpg wrek finish?
<Yahooz> ...maybe? https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54493344/Yahooz_OC.png
<Bronysith> oni_link: nope
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord where i was when wrek was drawing that ?
<Bronysith> oni_link: the right direction would be 2 shot gun blasts to his brains
<oni_link> Bronysith: yikes.
<Ryunosuke> new... sonic?
<AttacktheAndalite> http://attackwithhugs.deviantart.com/art/Attempt-0-314320360
<oni_link> It was fun for me. i liked it
<Reikim> Bronysith: Now that's just not nice. Besides, Sonic's cartoon incarnations have always been rather motor-mouthed.
<Ryunosuke> not always
<Meanwhile> Sonic needs to jump in a vat of hydrochloric acid.
<Ryunosuke> just the majority of
<Bronysith> and now off to me2
<TheShadowQuill> I have a good OC, but I am too lazy to draw it.
<Bronysith> to destroy the collectors and what not
<Reikim> All this violence against cartoon animals :<
<Ryunosuke> Sonic X was... meh...
<Meanwhile> Gotta go fast.
<Ryunosuke> that was the last sonic cartoon I watched
<oni_link> Meanwhile: and why do you feel so strongly ?
<Lil_B> Well, not much going on now for me here or on the Stream, I think I'll leave (have to sleep anyway XD)
<TheShadowQuill> Ryunosuke: What about Sonic F, an abridged version?
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, Lil_B
<oni_link> Ryunosuke: 4 kids...
<Lil_B> bye everyone, see you in ~9-10 hous
<Reikim> Ryunosuke: I'm referring mostly to the old, old cartoons. SatAM and Adventures.
<Meanwhile> oni_link: Because I watched my beloved Megadrive game warp and twist into the abomination it is today.
<Ryunosuke> I prefer to read the Archie Sonic comics
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bye Lil_B
<Meanwhile> Bye Lil_B.
<Vordox> Hai Lil_B
<oni_link> Meanwhile: so you didnt like the Dreamcast era?
<Meanwhile> oni_link: I couldn't get a Dreamcast/
<TheShadowQuill> Bai, Lil_B.
<Ryunosuke> SatAM wasnt ... terrible, it had flaws, but wasnt bad
<HatsuneMikuFan> Anyone up for L4D2?
<Reikim> My favourite Sonic game was Adventures 2. *waits*
<Lil_B> bye AttacktheAndalite HatsuneMikuFan Meanwhile Vordox and The_Browncoat :)
<TheShadowQuill> Reikim: Okay,
<Vordox> erm bye
<Lil_B> btw Vordox why didn't you answer :(
<Ryunosuke> the last sonic game I seriously played. was sonic 3 & knuckles
<Vordox> i got back
<oni_link> Reikim: It was fun. I miss the Chao gardens
<Reikim> Huh. No flames. That's odd.
*Reikim waits some more
<oni_link> Ryunosuke: so no 3d for you.
<oni_link> ?
<Ryunosuke> 3d sonic....
<TheShadowQuill> Whose OC is this?
<Major> so who is Wrek drawing? :P
<oni_link> Reikim: I dont see why youd be flamed
<Ryunosuke> 3d sonic just .... doesnt sit well with me
<Lil_B> Vordox OK XD, I just wanted you to know that I can work with GIMP now, but there is still one question left, but I'll ask you about that later
<killerpony7733> He's drawing Nittany_Discord me thinks
<Vordox> :D
<TheShadowQuill> I must say, Wrek, you are an amazing artist.
<Reikim> oni_link: 3d vs 2d Sonic is always a bit of a heated topic, especially when you get older gamers like we have around here.
<oni_link> Ryunosuke: but why exactly?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: There (s)he is.
<killerpony7733> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ikr? hes freaking amazing
<Reikim> Ryunosuke: But it wasn't really BAD until Shadow the Hedgehog.
<killerpony7733> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: wrong ping
<killerpony7733> TheShadowQuill: mean't that towards you :P
<oni_link> Reikim: Im a fan of both. grew up with a genesis and snes but honestly dont get why the hate is so strong towards 3d.
<Ryunosuke> I grew up with Sonic 1-3&K +Sonic CD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd hate to see it rushed, though.
<Reikim> oni_link: It's Shadow the Hedgehog, which was closely followed by Sonic 2006.
<Ryunosuke> everything else just seems...
<TheShadowQuill> I know it is Nittany_Discord because of MAID HOUR
<Ryunosuke> flavour of the year type
<oni_link> Reikim: those were bad. and sonic heroes imho.
<Ryunosuke> following the trend of Mario 64 and Zelda: OoT
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Ocarina of time is dah best Zelda game evah
<Reikim> Ryunosuke: Everyone tried to jump into the third dimension. It was really inevitable. Some hit a wall, other didn't.
<oni_link> Ryunosuke: i can understand mario but zelda is up for debate.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> this you Nittany_Discord ? R63?
<TheShadowQuill> Reikim: I succeded
<RaveBrony> Damn it....how does he get his strokes perfect on the first try :'(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is.
<TheShadowQuill> (succeeded
<Reikim> Segueway time!
<Reikim> Bronies, what is your favourite Zelda game?
<TheShadowQuill> RaveBrony: Because he is awesome like that.
<killerpony7733> RaveBrony: Talent and exprience
<Shamroc> soo what did shamroc miss?
<oni_link> Reikim: OOT
<AttacktheAndalite> Reikim: Never played a Zelda game
<oni_link> AttacktheAndalite: :o
<Ryunosuke> again, like Reikim said, everyone jumped on the bandwagon, some made it, like sonic and zelda, some hit a brick wall, like sonic
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Reikim: Wind Waker, cause sailing.
<killerpony7733> RaveBrony: Oh and hardware
<MahBoi777> AttacktheAndalite: a bit late, but I like your drawing :D
<zanon> im back
<oni_link> hello zanon
<Ryunosuke> *Mario and zelda, not sonic and zelda
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> ^^^ Wrek's livestreaming
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: It's horrific <3
<Reikim> Personally, my favourite Zelda is Twilight Princess, though I love all the 3d Zeldas to death.
<MahBoi777> AttacktheAndalite: NO, it looks fine^^
<AttacktheAndalite> Hai CupcakeWarrior
<Ryunosuke> my favorite, is either Minish cap, or LtP
<oni_link> Reikim: me too. how did you feel about skyward sword?
<oni_link> Ryunosuke: LtP was amazing. i honestly cant sit down to play Minish cap
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: That's the colors of my OC and that's what she looks like. So far I can only do headshots. Full body sketches end up being butchered and rage-quitted.
<Reikim> oni_link: I enjoyed it thoroughly. I felt it struck a nice balance between the TP and WW styles. And it also provided a definitive start point for the timeline, so I fan-gasmed hard.
<MahBoi777> AttacktheAndalite: Ah, I see lol
<Sumica> 00,10wreks true pasion, wings and manes
<zanon> ooh wrek who is dat?
<oni_link> Reikim: I felt it was a great start and now we have an official timeline due to it. :) the music really got to me too. the orchestrated fairy fountain made me shed manly tears
<TheShadowQuill> zanon: Nittany_Discord OC
<zanon> ahh hehe
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: I try and try and say "Fuck this shit" and rage to myself while looking at other artists' work and crying on the inside.
<Reikim> oni_link: Man, Ballad of the Goddess. Absolutely beautiful piece of music that captivates the feel of the entire game.
<Reikim> AttacktheAndalite: This is good. Builds CHARACTER.
*oni_link hugs Reikim
<oni_link> so true.
*Reikim hugs oni_link back
<AttacktheAndalite> Reikim: Nah, that's not even my best. I haven't gotten there yet.
<BRONY_4_LIFE> hey everypony
<oni_link> yay :) brb, gonna raid my fridge
<zanon> i raided the fridge already
<Meanwhile> I like this song.

<Pudge> Hey everypony I'm back, Wrek still drawing?
<zanon> yep
<MahBoi777> AttacktheAndalite: don't do that, your drawings are very good!
<BRONY_4_LIFE> it looks a little dodgey
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: What little drawings I have on there. I can't wait till I'm able to afford a tablet. Make it easier because right now I'm using a mouse from a desktop and a mouse on a laptop.

<Pudge> Reikim: Jenka's nightmare?
<TheShadowQuill> SparklyWaffles: Remember when everyone tried to eat you?
<Lunar_Brony> What is Wrek drawing now?
<Reikim> Pudge: Unofficial sequel. Even harder than Hell.
<TheHoodyNinja> Muffin0: because corporate greed ruins many good companies

<Ryunosuke> I'll tell you why EA sucks donkey balls
<TheShadowQuill> SparklyWaffles: Dark days... there was a war, I am still traumatized...
<Ryunosuke> Ultima 9: that is all
<TheHoodyNinja> ooooooh~ NCIS is on!
<Meanwhile> Ryunosuke: Does anyone really need to be told why EA sucks nowadays?
<SparklyWaffles> TheShadowQuill: :c
<BRONY_4_LIFE> what war
<BRONY_4_LIFE> their was a war
<cratorkid> Mufdfin0 they buy out great developers and give them tight deadlines and force them to make terribly overhyped games
<Lunar_Brony> Who is Wrek drawing?

*AttacktheAndalite catches some bacon
<SparklyWaffles> WOO, BACON PARTY

*Canadian_Brony runs away
<LadyCanary> ScootaChicken! :3
<zanon> beep beep beep
<Liokin> ScootaChicken: Scoots!
<TheHoodyNinja> LadyCanary: ... y u no has pants?
<LadyCanary> :| The Black Canary wears no pants.
<Canadian_Brony> hi ScootaChicken
<oni_link> SparklyWaffles: well... Ive seen worse :D youll definitely live. just apply some more bandaging and if needed a tourniquet above each major wound.
<LadyCanary> Do not question the motives of my waifu
<SparklyWaffles> Canadian_Brony: -_(\
<Yahooz> gah that must have been a pain to pose all dem angles LadyCanary
<Meanwhile> No time for pants, there's evil afoot!
<MahBoi777> hi ScootaChicken and LadyCanary
<oni_link> Meanwhile: EVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL!!!!!!
<SparklyWaffles> oni_link: Thank you, Doctor!! :D
<TheShadowQuill> Meanwhile: Then put on shoes!
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: They're pretty good, they're fairly good Scottish pop punk.
<xxMoopyxx> No not pinkamena diane pie
<Liokin> Meanwhile: Ha! nice.
<LadyCanary> Actually, it was on this moving pedastil, Yahooz
<ScootaChicken> Quite similar to the Buzzcocks
<Meanwhile> No time for shoes either!
<ScootaChicken> Their new album is great.
<oni_link> SparklyWaffles: My pleasure :P
<Yahooz> LadyCanary: oooooh. that most certainly helps XD
<TheHoodyNinja> Meanwhile: Feet arent evil!
<TheShadowQuill> Meanwhile: Underwear?
<Meanwhile> Time for underwear. If only to not put you to shame.
<RAWRity> Pants are for lesser superheroes...or just super heroes in general. For whatever reason (see: fanservice) most super heroines get sent into battle wearing glorified lingerie
<oni_link> TheShadowQuill: Thats if he remembered :D
<TheShadowQuill> oni_link: LOL
<TheHoodyNinja> Meanwhile: She has time for make up :/
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity Pants are for squares!
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: The boobage effect.
<Pudge> OH MAN
<TheHoodyNinja> holy shit is this supposed to be spawn?
<RAWRity> Canadian_Brony: are you saying batman is a square?
<Pudge> it's murderous pinkie :(
<oni_link> TheHoodyNinja: Gotta look sexy for the big fight
<TheShadowQuill> Canadian_Brony: Sponges are for bobs
<TheShadowQuill> CLOUDFLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEE
<oni_link> TheShadowQuill: What is this?? I dont even :D
<AdamTheDuck> does wrek have an art page on deviantart or something?
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity no, I'm quoting some old show I can't seem to remember the name of
<TheShadowQuill> Stream died
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<SparklyWaffles> :(
<Canadian_Brony> TheShadowQuill refresh
<TheHoodyNinja> TheShadowQuill: whens the funeral?
<TheShadowQuill> STREAM LIVES ON
<zanon> its because i was not allowed to eat waffles
<SparklyWaffles> zanon :o
<Xaiden> Ohh hey this looks nice
<TheHoodyNinja> damnit i had my someone died shirt ready
<TheShadowQuill> zanon: Were they sparkly?
<Canadian_Brony> hi Xaiden
<Xaiden> Hi
<Xaiden> ^^
<TheHoodyNinja> all the badass
<TheShadowQuill> WHOA
<TheHoodyNinja> oh hello Xaiden
<RAWRity> but serioiusly, even when super heroines get somewhat modest costumes, they STILL find ways to objectify them see: Power Girl's boob window
<zanon> welll whats wrong with waffles covered with glitter?
<oni_link> just had the best chocolate cupcake and I dont even know what brand it was :(
<Xaiden> what's he doing now?
<SparklyWaffles> I bought edible glitter and poured it on waffles. I live to my name every morning, now!
<TheShadowQuill> oni_link: First world problems
<SparklyWaffles> TheShadowQuill: xD
<oni_link> TheShadowQuill: bahahahahaha
<Xaiden> SparklyWaffles: That's commitment
<Canadian_Brony> oni_link hope it wasn't made by . . . *gulp* HER
<SparklyWaffles> Canadian_Brony: Does "HER" have a name?
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: you ever listened to a band called Accelerators
<TheShadowQuill> Canadian_Brony: Who is *gulp* HER?
<TheHoodyNinja> SparklyWaffles: they have edible glitter?
<cratorkid> sweet Sweedish house mafia
<TheHoodyNinja> SHIT!
<Xaiden> SparklyWaffles: Pinkimenia Pie i think
<Meanwhile> SparklyWaffles: Does she look like a bitch?
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: oh goodnes... me too. O.o the taste and texture was beyond normal
<SparklyWaffles> Xaiden: Yeah! 'Course they do!
<Reikim> RAWRity: I'm pretty sure there was at least one boob-less superheroine. Give me a second to try and remember.
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Yeah, they're alright.
<TheShadowQuill> THIS IS AMAZING
<oni_link> Reikim: powerpuff girls :D
<SparklyWaffles> TheHoodyNinja: Yes. xD
<TheShadowQuill> Wrek, what will you name it?
<RAWRity> Reikim: doesn't even have to be boobs. A lot of 'em also get gratuitous ass shots.
<Xaiden> Hey why are you looking at 6 year old's tits
<Canadian_Brony> SparklyWaffles TheHoodyNinja you know what? I'm going to stop talking it because the story's concept alone scares the sh*t outta me
<SparklyWaffles> Canadian_Brony: WAT. I'M CONFUSE.
<oni_link> so edible glitter, how is it?
<Xaiden> I can't tell which Pinkie is more creepy, Cupcakes Pinkie Pie, or this one <<
<TheHoodyNinja> SparklyWaffles: I tied a shirt to my face and put my hood up on my hoody so i looked like a ninja
<RAWRity> then of course there's panels where they're put in horribly awkward or uncomfortable positions to look sexy: http://beyondthebunker.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/starfire-1.jpg
<TheHoodyNinja> then went to school
<TheShadowQuill> Meet the Pinkie Pyro.
<AttacktheAndalite> this pinkie looks like a biker.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Assless and boobless. I know there's at least one. It was in a weird short series I read once.
<Canadian_Brony> Xaiden as much as I care, there is no difference
<oni_link> Xaiden: I think this one is badass, but Cupcakes Pinke is way creepier
<Xaiden> LAWL
<TheHoodyNinja> Blade?
<TheHoodyNinja> Is this supposed to look badass or is it a reference to something?
<TheShadowQuill> My Name is Skrillex.
<cratorkid> The ShadowQuill its not minky its pinkamena
<cratorkid> pinky*
<Canadian_Brony> TheShadowQuill and I never use ductape
<Xaiden> wait did this guy draw that Pinkie Pie <<
<cratorkid> no pinkamena
<TheShadowQuill> Silence is golden, duct tape is silver.
<Xaiden> Lo
<oni_link> duct tape... i am confused
<cratorkid> trolol
<Canadian_Brony> TheShadowQuill ductape is awesome, bro
<Canadian_Brony> oni_link look at my name
<Xaiden> You put duct tape on someone's mouth if they won't shut up
<TheHoodyNinja> I use electrical tape
<zanon> yumm scootanoodle soup is so tasty
<RAWRity> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/558264_2269053182543_1188484944_n.jpg
<TheShadowQuill> I LIKE DUCK TAPE
<cratorkid> mr bean likes ponies
<Canadian_Brony> TheShadowQuill I was being sarcastic
<TheShadowQuill> RAWRity: Mr. Bean
<TheHoodyNinja> this looks so badass
<oni_link> hmm...
<Bluestrom_S> is Wrek playing SHM again?
<oni_link> 6_9
<TheShadowQuill> Michael Bay directed this picture
<Canadian_Brony> Bluestrom_S he's drawing
<Bluestrom_S> very nice drawing indeed
<cratorkid> shm is sweedidh house mafia, a music group
<TheHoodyNinja> TheShadowQuill: fuck that Wrek did this
<cratorkid> and yes he is
<TheShadowQuill> What will this be called
<zanon> i want that jacket .. on me
<Canadian_Brony> TheShadowQuill the picture that will haunt my dreams
<RAWRity> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s480x480/552402_2266748604930_867905148_n.jpg
<TheShadowQuill> I could pull of that jacket
<Reikim> RAWRity: Aha. I found it, among my Free Comic Book Day pile. However, it's not a "traditional" superheroine. It's a girl who gets contracted by an angel to kill monsters, a bit like Buffy only darker and edgier. Completely flat-chested, no ass-shots.
<Bluestrom_S> glad to see something new keep them coming wrek
<RAWRity> Reikim: who published it?
<oni_link> RAWRity: hahahahahaha
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity, out of curiosity, how come you don't like Green Day?
<TheHoodyNinja> ScootaChicken: What.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Dark Horse, according to the cover.
<TheHoodyNinja> someone doesnt like Greenday
<TheHoodyNinja> :o
<TheHoodyNinja> eh
<ScootaChicken> TheHoodyNinja: It's understandable.
<ScootaChicken> I know plenty of people who don't like them, and with good reason.
<TheShadowQuill> TheHoodyNinja: IDK
<oni_link> i dont either. not newer greenday at least
*cratorkid nods
<TheHoodyNinja> whatever, i got by music
<Canadian_Brony> I like "Holiday"
<TheHoodyNinja> my*
<Canadian_Brony> and "American Idiot"
<TheHoodyNinja> ^
<TheShadowQuill> I can /me all I want
<ScootaChicken> I personally really like them, but I can completely understand what people have against them.
<TheHoodyNinja> Im amurican
<ScootaChicken> Pfft, American Idiot
<TheHoodyNinja> american*
<SparklyWaffles> 'MURICA
<ScootaChicken> Overrated song.
<ScootaChicken> It's probably the third worst song on the album : P
<Canadian_Brony> ScootaChicken look at my name
<TheShadowQuill> TheHoodyNinja: I am Earthican.
<ScootaChicken> Canadian_Brony: Doesn't add to it's merit as a song/
<TheHoodyNinja> lol
<ScootaChicken> Or lack thereof.
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: I feel that their music, even in the early years was mediocre at best, and that as they've continued their career, they've only gotten worse and mroe phoned in, yet continue to be viewed as good representatives of punk music. I also hate how many imitators their success has led to, further diluting the punk scene with heartless, soulless acts only in it for the money.
<TheShadowQuill> TheHoodyNinja: I am a normal human who does normal human things.
<cratorkid> ^
<AdamTheDuck> TheShadowQuill But then what is considered normal if we're all different?
<Canadian_Brony> ScootaChicken I like the song by itself, but I find it funnier when I consider my nationality
<RAWRity> the fact that they haven't even made a remotely "punk" album in over a decade doesn't help matters.
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: now see, i never viewed them as a punk rock band
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: That's fair enough.
<ScootaChicken> Although the stuff on Kerplunk is pretty good.
<TheHoodyNinja> therefore i never expected it from them
<TheShadowQuill> AdamTheDuck: I brush my normal human teeth. This is a normal game you are witnessing.
<Saturn> 08,01# i really am so happy/ your smile fills me with glee #
<cratorkid> save th world
<Canadian_Brony> hi Saturn
<killerpony7733> Saturn: Hiya saturn
<Saturn> 08,01# i give a smile, i get a smile / and that's so special to me #
<Saturn> 08,01ehy all!
*AttacktheAndalite hugs Saturn
*Canadian_Brony smiles
*Saturn 08,01bounces around the channel
<Reikim> RAWRity: Unfortunately, other than that, everything else I got from Free Comic Book Day is either kids' stuff, strange stuff or, as you've noted, women with the most common superpower.
<TheHoodyNinja> I dont like bands per se, i just like music
<zanon> Its a sega saturn
<sub06905|Sleepy> well that was a good nap :$
<ScootaChicken> Although to be honest RAWRity, whilst I'll admit I like them a lot, I definitely wouldn't see them as an example of punk music.
<panda-store> Saturn O____o
<TheHoodyNinja> if a band makes good music, i like them, but not all their songs
<ScootaChicken> If someone was trying to get into punk music, I wouldn't recommend them Green Day.
<ScootaChicken> Or at least, not Post Nimrod Green Day.
<Canadian_Brony> TheHoodyNinja same. The only exceptions would be Simple Plan, ABBA, and ELO
<TheShadowQuill> What the hay happened to Saturn? Did anyone spike his drink?
<oni_link> ScootaChicken: exactly
<RAWRity> TheHoodyNinja: neither do i, but like a lot of stuff, the general public heard a word, applied it to something they thought it fit, and fucked it up. Like how people think MCR is emo, or that "screamo" equals anything with screaming.
<Canadian_Brony> TheShadowQuill Saturn drank Spike?!?
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: thats not screamo?! holy crap!
<cratorkid> whos gunna save the worlds
<TheShadowQuill> Canadian_Brony: Exactly.
<TheHoodyNinja> What is screamo then?
<Canadian_Brony> cratorkid Canadians
<ScootaChicken> Their aesthetic aside, I don't really understand why people call MCR emo.
<TheHoodyNinja> cratorkid: ninjas
<TheShadowQuill> TheHoodyNinja: Rebecca Black.
<sub06905|Sleepy> is this Rarity?
<Elements> SO EPIC :D
<TheHoodyNinja> lol
<cratorkid> CAnadians
<Shamroc> oh hello Saturn...how is you this fine day?
<cratorkid> THEY GOT THIS
<ScootaChicken> I mean, if you take the time to listen to their music, it's hardly representative of the genre as a whole.
<oni_link> sub06905|Sleepy: tis pinkie
<LightningDashFast> hey everypony
<RAWRity> TheHoodyNinja: orchid, Pg. 99, Comadre, Saetia
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> OOOHMAYGOD!
<Kandarihu> Alright. I think I'm ready to try playing online. But I'm going to be using a hardcore character.
<Reikim> RAWRity: To be fair, to be even able to distinguish between anything other than "pop" takes years of experience that most listeners aren't going to get.
<TheShadowQuill> sub06905|Sleepy: Why would you think that?
<ScootaChicken> I mean, Teenagers is a fucking 12 bar blues rock song/
<LightningDashFast> Pinkamena
<sub06905|Sleepy> nope its Apllejack :P
<Pudge> Pinkamena Murder Pie :S
<Reikim> RAWRity: Example: anything electronic these days is apparently dubstep. I had to explain to a friend the other day why he was actually listening to trance.
<RAWRity> Reikim: or rather, it takes some actual research, rather than somebody looking up a band's genre on wikipedia.
<TheShadowQuill> This is Derpy
<LightningDashFast> GOOD LOOKING PINKAMENA<3
<TheShadowQuill> Or Trixie
<RAWRity> silly fillies, this is Braeburn, obviously.
<sonicandmario85> hello :3
<TheHoodyNinja> Nope its luna
<TheHoodyNinja> im right your all wrong
<RAWRity> TheShadowQuill: no, this is not my car.
<Kandarihu> So, is there a Bronystate Terraria server?
<sonicandmario85> god damit pinkamena XD

<killerpony7733> FlareChaser: /)
*TheHoodyNinja has not played deus ex machina
<AttacktheAndalite> killerpony7733: aw. okay :3
<LightningDashFast> (\
<TheShadowQuill> I can't help but notice a lot of Wrek
*SparklyWaffles rummages through everyone's medicine cabinet
<TheHoodyNinja> or knows what it is about
<SparklyWaffles> I NEED MEDICINE!
<TheShadowQuill> drawings have leather jackets
<FlareChaser> killerpony7733: (\
<LightningDashFast> the future of equestria
<Vordox> HAHAHAA
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Think he should have wings due to the icarus metaphor of the game?
<FlareChaser> Brohoofs all around~ /)
<Vordox> Deus Ex Wrek. :D
<AttacktheAndalite> Who's Garkellar?
<TheShadowQuill> Do you want to know the meaning of life?
<Reikim> Ahaha, is that a ponified Adam Jenson? I approve so much.
<LightningDashFast> Upgrade enhancements for everyponi
<TheHoodyNinja> TheShadowQuill: whatever makes you happy, that is the key
<Vordox> Fun Fact: I am playing that right now :P
<LightningDashFast> I have the game too
<TheShadowQuill> TheHoodyNinja: The real meaning is... wait for it...
<TheShadowQuill>
<SparklyWaffles> TheShadowQuill: :o
<LightningDashFast> Icarus refrence ftw
<TheShadowQuill> Should I repeat that?
<FlareChaser> Fun fact: Deus Ex is a good game.
<TheShadowQuill>
<killerpony7733> LightningDashFast: Hehehe ikr?
<LightningDashFast> (\
<SparklyWaffles> TheShadowQuill: WHAT
<TheShadowQuill> SparklyWaffles: Is your mind blown?
<TheHoodyNinja> TheShadowQuill: so your like nothings?
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Will you be uploading the quick sketches?
<Reikim> Icarus, son of...forgot his name.
<SparklyWaffles> TheShadowQuill: Mind=blown
<Pudge> be right back
<Reikim> Flew too close to the sun, and the wax on his wings melted, leading to his untimely death.
<killerpony7733> Icarus son of daedalus i think
<TheShadowQuill> TheHoodyNinja: No, for some reason, it keeps coming up blank!
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: What?
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: Just recapping the Icarus story for those who haven't heard it. I can go into more detail, if you'd like.
<RaveBrony> What is he drawing now? :O
<LightningDashFast> Deadelus
<LightningDashFast> ....
<killerpony7733> RaveBrony: Adam jensen pony
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: Adam J- you should know this :|
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: no i know what your talking about, just have no idea why you bring it up
<TheHoodyNinja> TheShadowQuill: well what is it?
<TheShadowQuill> qwertyuiop asdfghjkl zxcvnm and that is the internet alphabet!
<LightningDashFast> Coming from Twilight Sparkle technologies
<Vordox> If you get this drawing done Wrek...Make sure it goes to EQD.
<TheShadowQuill> TheHoodyNinja: Okay... here it is... it is quite simply...
<TheShadowQuill>
<TheHoodyNinja> :|
<LightningDashFast> lol
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: Deus Ex: HR had a lot of Icarus symbology. It's actually quite well-developed. The "wings" could be a metaphor for augmentation. Sarif is Daedalus, and Adam is Icarus.
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: There's actually a lot of symbolism in that game, if you look close enough.
<TheShadowQuill> TheHoodyNinja: What? I am trying to type it!
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: again, ive never played that game or game series, i dont even know
<TheShadowQuill> TheHoodyNinja: Watch:
<TheShadowQuill>
<TheShadowQuill> See?
<Reikim> TheShadowQuill: Are you ninja-pinging?
<TheHoodyNinja> TheShadowQuill: the answer of life is not nothing
<LightningDashFast> I could actually see Twilight Sparkle making augmentations
<Wrek> 05lets see
<Wrek> 05i think i could make this look good
<Wrek> 05in time
