<TROctavia> Did anyone else get a Kingdom Hearts vibe from the nightmare doors scene, or is it just me?
<CriticKitten> Well, wait, before I rip this thing down....here's what I think would make it WORK.
<NocturnalBlade> Scoot-Scootaloo: so much MLG lol
<CriticKitten> Well, rather, here's what I would do with it.
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Scoot-Scootaloo: just one of those meh days
<Stallion_of_War> Dashie_Dashie: No, it'd be more like "Every day I'm buf **************"
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten go on
<CriticKitten> Sombre turns out to be the guy who corrupted Luna into NMM, for one.
<DerpyMuffins> Everything is MLG with you Scoot-Scootaloo
<CriticKitten> That way it ties the existing material in.
<Silver_Spoon> hrmmmm...wrong one, but right intent. Sorta
<MirrorImage> TROctavia - actually, i find that scene rather inspiring for a one-off encounter in a D&D sesion
<WinterSpeed> Everyday I'm bu(insert buffering circle here)
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten because of the spell that made the empire disappear for 1000 years?
<moon-pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZHwGnGrm_k
<Rommulus> the book is dark, a darker gray that is and from what I can see is twilights cutie mark on it
<Stormy> o.o
<AdamTheDuck> Enjoy some music everyone as we wait for a stream to pop up agian .-. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9vDcxviKQA
<[SWAG]Haku> Thats another thing
<Stormy> I see we had a few new people
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Anyways people, Gigabit and Allegr0 will be working with me on some days for the Celestia Radio/Bronystate collab show every week for the new episodes
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> CriticKitten: wanna bet fanfics would be better than Lauren's writers?
<PaRappaTheRapper> Come on, buffer!
<[SWAG]Haku> If the empire went away for 1000 years, would Celestia know ALOT about it?
<Afflict> yep
<Pegasister> soo slow
<DRHUnleashed> geez, buffering
<Pegasister> D:
<Quick_Thinker> i see the usuals are still here allthough now we have some new people
*Kurra QQs and hugs ponyfolk
<fluttershyfan99> i'm new!
<[SWAG]Haku> Her and Luna were suppose to have been ruling long before then
<AdamTheDuck> Hello there Kurra
<Ryunosuke> princess luna was also exiled for 1000 years...
<hen3ry> Everything important happened 1000 years ago. No exceptions.
<Pegasister> im new :D'
*thelonepony hugs Kura :3
*AJIsAwesome hugs Kurra :)
<flutterchu> so what is Celestia raido? is it a chatting website?
<WinterSpeed> BUFFER
<flutterchu> 8radio
<flutterchu> I MEAN RADIO
<[SWAG]Haku> But she was there for Sombra exile
<fluttershyfan99> can i get a hug :(
<Quick_Thinker> flutterchu its a radio site
<CriticKitten> Then I'd have Sombre manipulate Equestria through various individuals they've seen before, like Gilda or Trixie, and show up at the finale in a culmination of various small plot threads to tie together as this big showdown between Twilight and Sombre.
<Time> EVERYTHING IS 1000
<WinterSpeed> Celestia Radio is a radio
<Ryunosuke> and we dont know how long the crystal kingdom was around either
<flutterchu> Quick_Thinker: what does that mean?
*Kurra fluffs thelonepony :>
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten WRITE IT
<Stormy> I always feel bad for younger fans who think they're going to get game companies to accept their ideas...
<DRHUnleashed> do we get moar carl sagan after this?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> In case y'all are confused, Bronystate is NOT leaving! Those two are :P
<Quick_Thinker> its just like pandora it plays a ton of songs
*thelonepony attaches to Kura :>
<Quick_Thinker> most are brony related
<Ryunosuke> well perhaps she exiled herself to escape sombras spell?
<Kandarihu> Buffer Rock is in the HOOOOUSE TONIIIIIGHT, everypony just has a bad time. Circle's gonna make us LOOOOSE our MIIINDS, we just want to see mods.... STREAM THAT
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Lol, who really thought Bronystate was leaving
<TROctavia> I liked 'em enough to follow them after hearing them once
<CriticKitten> I'd also have the "dark magic" thing play as a corrupting force. Its use slowly corrupts the user. This could explain why Luna became NMM, she was trained to use Sombre's dark magic and overused it and thus became evil.
<Dark_Horst> did anyone else just fell off the xyzzy game again?
<WinterSpeed> we just wanna see mods...(buffercircle)....stream that
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Quick_Thinker> oh yeah and i wish to mention MY GAMESTOP $#%#ed UP AND DELIVERED MY BLACK OPS 2 IN THE MAIL :D
<CriticKitten> I'm crossing my paws in the hopes that Trixie's upcoming return will play into that.
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Quick_Thinker: the real problem is you preordered Black Ops 2
<AJIsAwesome> I could also see Twlight almost becoming corrupted because of said dark magic.
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten I was teriffied when Celestia used it on that one crystal in the start
<Ryunosuke> that actually makes sense, seeing what I have from sombras magic
<Kandarihu> WinterSpeed, nice touch
<Quick_Thinker> i love it when those fools screw up
<superretroworld> GigabotHarmonie: Allegr0 sorry to cancel the show :(
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: I'll join you.
<DerpyMuffins> Domo you still streaming?
<twilight_sprinkle> also, how bout dat dark magic twilight? that was total win
<Domo> DerpyMuffins: Nope
<Quick_Thinker> i've already played zambies and BUCK its awesome
<Kurra> When Twilight did dark magic and uncovered that staircase, I got flashbacks of Metroid Prime 2.
<Kinixys> Cards against humanity died agin.
<WinterSpeed> ZAMBEHS
<fluttershyfan99> so what is going on with the lack of streem... i'm new
<CriticKitten> I'd like to see Trixie come back, wielding Sombre's dark magic in an effort to regain her lost dignity. She takes over, but gets defeated, and this helps reveal the possibility that NMM was created by Luna's own misuse of dark magic, which results in Luna beginning to train Twilight.
<Shizuka> 13Patience ponies.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<CriticKitten> That's what I'd hope for, anyways.
<[SWAG]Haku> ^^^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> fluttershyfan99: because no one is streaming yet :P
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> well we're ppl so we dont have patience
<fluttershyfan99> got it
<Quick_Thinker> got a random idea WHO WANTS TO PLAY A GAME OF PRETEND YOUR ZXY :D
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten why do you make me agree with you?!
<Quick_Thinker> i'll go make a game room
<fluttershyfan99> will there be streaming soon?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: nah i dont think shes evil enough for that
<CriticKitten> Because I have good points and I think them through. :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> anyways guys, I am off to bed~ Night y'all!
<PaRappaTheRapper> bye people.
<AJIsAwesome> Night Scoot-Scootaloo. :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I love you all <3
<Dashie_Dashie> Shizuka, anymore stream shenannigans tonight?
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Scoot-Scootaloo
<thelonepony> night Scoot-Scootaloo :)
<[SWAG]Haku> twilight_sprinkle he just said alot of stuff leading into it
<TROctavia> The scene with Spike crying over leaving twilight.. Is that something that was previously alluded to in a past episode, or was that perhaps a bit of fan-generated extrapolation prior to the premiere?
<LunasGuard> this is for those like gak so much http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/311199_496978033666490_53153234_n.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^^
<Quick_Thinker> we got enough GAK as it is
<twilight_sprinkle> [SWAG]Haku: into trixie being evil? i dont feel like shes that evil in any case
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I dunno. She's been publically humiliated in front of an entire town by this one filly. And then a dark force shows up and offers her revenge....
<Quick_Thinker> shes just a show off not really evil
<CriticKitten> And offers to teach her "real magic"
<fluttershyfan99> i don't have enough gak
<CriticKitten> Magic that she can use to show up that filly that outclassed her
<Zamer> Anyone want to join me in Board Game Online http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
<Lightning> oh good god i just saw the GAK post on EQD
<CriticKitten> I think it'd work very well, actually.
<sub06905> http://i.imgur.com/CR3wi.jpg
<sub06905> :>
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: meh, not very original in any case. plus trixie doesnt seem like the majorly evil type, she seems more like just an arrogant pony is all,not pure evil
<CriticKitten> It's a pretty classic revenge story. The sort that turns someone who is just generally unlikable into a TRUE antagonistic villain.
<Dark> DERP
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> sub06905: :D
<superretroworld> Lightning: uh oh
<[SWAG]Haku> twilight_sprinkle something tells me you havent seen the poster yet
<TROctavia> She needs to lose the show facade
<Quick_Thinker> okay just created a game in pretend your Xyzzy come on in and play PASSWORD IS Brony http://pyz.socialgamer.net/game.jsp
<TROctavia> to become truly evil
<Dark> 6_9
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I dunno. She clearly didn't learn from her prior engagement and basically swore revenge, albeit in a comic relief way.
<twilight_sprinkle> [SWAG]Haku: the __ vs __? i saw that today nfortunately. but still, i dont think it would be right to make her so evil, i dont feel its in character
<[SWAG]Haku> She was in 1 episode
<CriticKitten> I think it'd be a nice change of pace actually
<[SWAG]Haku> All we saw was that she liked to brag
<TROctavia> No villian is villianous while simultaneously caring about how others think of her
<TROctavia> her/him, either/or
<Quick_Thinker> oh yeah and my limit of players is up to 20
<CriticKitten> Instead of having villains who are villains because its FOR TEH EVULZ, it'd be nice to see a villain who you could reasonably sympathize with.
<Zamer> just created a game in Board Game Online Open to Everyone http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten Like NMN?
<[SWAG]Haku> NMM
<Dark> CLAP DEM CHEEKS
<AJIsAwesome> ......
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: im not even sure shed be brave enough for something like that, plus her hate seems pretty concentrated. unless they go with the whole "blinded by hate" but then again, a character like hers seems more like a character whos just insecure rather than more evil
<Dark> :D
<TROctavia> Idk if I really sympathize with NMM as much as I would if it were Luna in Luna form
<CriticKitten> And Trixie's case is one where you could potentially sympathize. Sure she was a braggart and arrogant, but she also got shown up in public and basically reduced to a national laughingstock overnight. Her life and career could have been ruined.
<Afflict> yeah I kinda felt bad when he left
<[SWAG]Haku> Nightmare Moon just wanted some attention, Discord was just following his nature, Chrysalis was doing her duty as queen
<MrPie309> Does anyone have a pair of bag shoes?
<MrPie309> Cause i lost mine
<CriticKitten> Mind, I don't like Trixie, but if they played that angle, I would respect it.
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten Actually, she was only humiliated in one town, and we have seen nothing to say otherwise
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: i like trixie actually, shes my third favorite pony. plus we already had a blinded by revenge pony, that would be NMM, doing it with trixie would be repeating itself
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Hard to say, we never really got to see that much of her.
<CriticKitten> Haku: Aye, but that's my point.
<[SWAG]Haku> twilight_sprikle NMM wasnt blinded by rage, she just wanted some attention
<CriticKitten> We don't know how the events of that night played out elsewhere.
<TROctavia> I like any villian that has the protagonist by the berries at least once to the point where deus ex machina is the only obvious way out for the audience
<Lightning> CriticKitten: that and her whole house cart thing got stepped on
<Time> And now... Gak on loop. http://www.gak-is-back.com/
<Lightning> so she has nothing now
<CriticKitten> Maybe when that story spread, she became a national laughingstock and her career was basically over. I could see them play that up.
<Dark> *90% of her watching*
<[SWAG]Haku> She was atraveling magician in a trailer...
<[SWAG]Haku> Im pretty bsure she didnt have much of a reputation
<twilight_sprinkle> [SWAG]Haku: id say its more rage. wanting attention doesnt drive you to take over the world. it was rage caused from lack of not so much attention, but love towards her creations
<CriticKitten> Since they didn't actually tell us what happened to her afterwards, we have no way of knowing.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: still, in any case that scenario is very similar to NMM one
<Afflict> hey Shibaru
<CriticKitten> Haku: Again, we don't know. I'm pointing out that for such a strangely beloved character, very little is actually known of her. Mostly it's inferred. :P
<[SWAG]Haku> I want a villain who's a villain because they have to be, because they have no other choice
<CriticKitten> Or based on fanon which has been stamped out before.
<Dark> 6_9
<TROctavia> i feel like
<sir_> hai every pony
<CriticKitten> So really, they could do a lot with her. I could see the "becomes a villain" angle.
<Pegasister> anyone read dark esquestria before?
<thelonepony> Hi sir_ :)
<twilight_sprinkle> i suspect that if trixie comes back, the most that mightve happen is shell go overkill, and end up repenting
<TROctavia> bronies have loved things b4 knowing much about them before
<CriticKitten> It'd be fun to watch in any case, if they do it right.
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten Dude, Im on your side here
<twilight_sprinkle> *might
<Quick_Thinker> 9 people in my game of pretend you Xyzzy COME ON IN password is Brony
<CriticKitten> I'm hoping it goes beyond that.
<twilight_sprinkle> i think we have enough villains, i dont trixie to become one. id rather she stay the way she is, and maybe have an insecure side revealed
<Zamer> Join if your bored and want to play a fun game http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
<DerpyMuffins> You guys remember this morning?
<DerpyMuffins> 3k people here
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Yep.
<DerpyMuffins> Now just 200
<thelonepony> eeyup
<CriticKitten> Because let's be honest, if Sombre is going to be a big playing force in the world....he needs to, like, do stuff.
<[SWAG]Haku> twilight_sprinkle Yeah, again, the poster... pretty sure she's about to cross the line between Villain and Antangoist
<thelonepony> peace and quiet =w=
<superretroworld> Derpy_Hooves: 3000? your shittin me?
<Zamer> nope
<CriticKitten> Corrupting former antagonists would be a fun way to go about that.
<DerpyMuffins> Just goes to show you, people are willing to unite to watch ponies
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: Tab fail. :)
<Zamer> Derpy is telling the truth
<DerpyMuffins> 140
<twilight_sprinkle> [SWAG]Haku: still seemed like more antagonist to me, although i tried not to look at it too close
<Derpy_Hooves> wha?
<DerpyMuffins> 10 more and I get a cookie
<Lightning> Quick_Thinker : whats Xyzzy
<CriticKitten> Not to mention it would teach a valuable lesson that applies to the real world.
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: Someone tabfailed.
<Dark> *80% of her watching*
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: whoops :D
<DerpyMuffins> Nothing Derpy_Hooves just another tab fail
<[SWAG]Haku> I really wanted a redemption episode for Trixie...
<DerpyMuffins> It's up to 140
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol picture Sombra as Ansem while listening to this :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Gf2Xbwbts
<Quick_Thinker> lighting i'll put the link up basically its apples to apples for THE INTERNET (it has bad word and sexual puns YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
<Quick_Thinker> http://pyz.socialgamer.net/game.jsp
<Zamer> 10 More People Welcome to join http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
<[SWAG]Haku> Like a sorta "Ponies change over time, and can even the worst of ponies can ebcome friends" thing
<CriticKitten> Namely, you should try to be kind even to those who stir up trouble, rather than trying to embarrass them. If you're not careful, you may create your own "villain". It's something that comics do quite a lot actually.
<CriticKitten> With villains being born out of good intentions gone bad.
<CriticKitten> Or just downright bad situations in general.
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten Im no longer agreeing with, but merely nodding my head
<Pegasister> ._. Why is nothing playing????
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> CriticKitten: sooo Trixie is Twilight's Venom? :D Twilie's Spider Mare! :D
<DRHUnleashed> beardfucking
<AJIsAwesome> :S
<Pegasister> :[
<CriticKitten> Hey, it'd be fun.
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten like a Sad Villain; a villain who has no other choice but to be a villain
<CriticKitten> I like it better than "Trixie comes back, does exact same dickish things and is beaten again, then leaves" anyways, which is likely what will happen. >_>
<CriticKitten> A rehash of the original episode would just be lame. I'd rather her return be DIFFERENT.
<[SWAG]Haku> ^^^
*[SWAG]Haku nods head
<superretroworld> CriticKitten: awww i was hope she would change her ways :S
<Quick_Thinker> her return is probely having her pissed off
<Quick_Thinker> i mean she pretty much got banished from Ponyville
<superretroworld> hoping*
<TROctavia> From that picture on eqd, i think its more of a struggle to beat her
<TROctavia> than the current ep
<Quick_Thinker> and dont even forget the previews we got from the ending of S3
<CriticKitten> That's why I'm rooting for Sombre manipulation subplot. :P
<thelonepony> ohai NocturnalBlade :3
<[SWAG]Haku> I dont want a the ponies to struggle with Trixie, I want Trixie to struggle with the ponies
<WinterSpeed> SombrA
<Pegasister> .-.
<[SWAG]Haku> I wanted her to come back and get redemption
<Zamer> Are you feeling mad, are you feeling glad, do you wish you could have something to gloat to your fellow friends, well look no futher and come play Board Game Online http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
<CriticKitten> Because a) it makes Sombre less useless; b) it means potentially more Luna screentime; c) it'd be a BIG step up from the stories of before
<superretroworld> [SWAG]Haku: i want trixie to beg twilight to forgive her
<[SWAG]Haku> Hell no
<WinterSpeed> SOMBRA
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone see the journal at the end?
<[SWAG]Haku> No begging from Trixie
<TROctavia> come join Zamer
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: I did.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> I hope she returns maybe manipulated into doing BUT redeems herself and become friends or at least a friend/rival character IF she were to be approached by one of the princesses maybe? idk but i do wanna see at LEAST turn good in the end :$
<WinterSpeed> IT IS SOMBRA
<[SWAG]Haku> Just her coming back, maybe still a bit arrogant, and sacing the day somehow
<Zamer> Haku superretroworld how about you two settle this in a game
<Zamer> :P
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka, Sumica, Domo: I'
<J_E_Smith71> Whoops
<Shizuka> 13wat
<J_E_Smith71> I screwed that up
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku doesnt feel like playing a card game
<flutterchu> anonymus asked: how much wood can a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood. my answer (if there's no spaces that means im talking really fast): wellfirstofallwhatthef**kisawoodchuckandwhydopeoplehavetotellmethesekindofquistionsitjus'tsirritatesmetoseethatpeoplehavechangebecause, sotheansweris1,000,0000,00000,000000,00000000becausethewoodchuckisreallyChuckNorrisandhewouldnotevengetCLOSEtothathewouldgoalotfartherblahblahblah

<Pegasister> Derpy Hooves nothing is playing on my screen
<superretroworld> Zamer: battle till the death?
<thelonepony> what>
<Zamer> it's a board game
<DerpyMuffins> Dat spam
<Shizuka> 13flutterchu: Do not spam. You know better.
<CriticKitten> I would be fine with a redemption ending. I just want her return to not just be random dickiness because REVEEEEENGE.
<thelonepony> what?*
<Zamer> there is lots of death
<[SWAG]Haku> flutterchu the actual answer is 7 pounds
<Buytoast> goddamn
<DerpyMuffins> You are not new flutterchu
<Zamer> and muffins
<DerpyMuffins> Expectations
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: I see what you mean.
<Quick_Thinker> come on in guys we got 12 people in this game need only 8 more password is Brony http://pyz.socialgamer.net/game.jsp
<CriticKitten> If it ends up being poorly written, I'll only hate her character more than before, and nothing of value will have been served by her return. >_>
<[SWAG]Haku> A wood chuck would 7 punds if a wood chuck could chuck wood
<flutterchu> Shizuka: but that's a sentance...just with no spaces.......which means im talking real fast
<Zamer> http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG Everyone come join we need a few more players
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh
<CrystalPhoenix> What's next? Mafia wars?
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<TROctavia> stream pleases
<CriticKitten> Or, in other words: if a former antagonist has to return, it's best if the return actually serves a purpose.
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<[SWAG]Haku> serves a purpose about friendship
<CriticKitten> And also I want more Luna, so yeah. This subplot needs to happen. :|
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol now i kinda wanna Trixie as Twi's Garry Oak :D
<[SWAG]Haku> The whole "some people can change for the better" actually ha shappened to me
<[SWAG]Haku> One of my best friend was a complete dick in middle school
<[SWAG]Haku> and now I love him like a brother
<pony_2630> play some youtube poop
<[SWAG]Haku> Why not do that with Trixie?

<AJIsAwesome> I would like to see more of Celestia as well as Luna. Maybe some backstory of the two, perhaps?
<Allegr0> I'm going to log off for the night, but I just want to thank all of you for being the best muthafuckin' pixels you can be
<CriticKitten> So yeah, bring on the Sombre subplot. Do eet, writers. Do. Eet.

<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka Allegr0 GigabotHarmonie Sumica and to any other staff: Today's been such a hectic day for everyone. The troubles trying to keep everything in working order during the premiere, the goof ups with Dari and EMN, the emotional round with Allegr0 and Giga moving their show to other places. It's such a heavy day and I'd like to thank you all of the time and effort you guys all do to give us this good free entertainment.

<dinomaster626> bye
<dinomaster626> GAK
<J_E_Smith71> Saturn: Again like I said, you did a good job on the all the prep work you did this week. Site ran normal and smooth during the episode, aside from the stream and chat bits that were out of your hands (And the stream buffers were the ones I usually get so it wasn't out of the ordinary for me)
<Quick_Thinker> only thing i had an issue with was the chat but i heard you removed it to save the site from crashing
<Scootaloo_Pie> hi
<Dashie_Dashie> Now.. is there ANY way to play the MLP Game that Gameloft made, without a mobile device?
<[SWAG]Haku> Chickled pie sounds really good right now
<J_E_Smith71> Here's hoping we're good to go for smooth sailing for the rest of the season
<[SWAG]Haku> *chicken
<Punkie_Pue> Dashie_Dashie: You maybe able to run android in a virtual machine

<DaringDerpy> good morning :)
<thelonepony> Hi DaringDerpy :)
<Punkie_Pue> Do you guys think the gak meme is going to stick around for a while?
<sub06905> hopefully no
<[SWAG]Haku> no
<NullRadix> Punkie_Pue: as long as people keep giving it attention
<Punkie_Pue> I really hope not.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DaringDerpy. :)
<[SWAG]Haku> therehave been other non pony memes in the fandom before, but they all died shortly after
<Punkie_Pue> Dashie_Dashie: Message me if i can help.
<J_E_Smith71> The chat did act weird when the side rooms were first opened (It was telling me to install Flash) But when I got it working I was good
<DaringDerpy> Punkie_Pue: it will...just as chuck norris jokes, your mother jokes, arrow to the knee jokes....some idiot will always find it funny
<Punkie_Pue> thats reassuring.
<Pegasister> Has anyone written a fanfic based on MLP : FiM??? I Hve :D
<CriticKitten> I hope it doesn't stick around. Gak isn't all that funny by itself.
<DerpyMuffins> I been writing a fanfic

*DaringDerpy is a mix of swedish merchants, dutch rural nobility and lusitian native farmers

<[SWAG]Haku> I remember otakon winning just a couple weeks ago
<Cipher> 0,14holy shit, there's going to be a new Morel Orel special on Adult Swim
<otakon> weak?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hope Shining gets his horn checked ou- wait....:D
<otakon> bullshit SIlver Bullet is weak
<Pegasister> o.o
<thelonepony> really?
<Stallion_of_War> Now I feel like voting for The Wrath of Khan for movie night.
<thelonepony> Bullshit :I
<otakon> it's probably the best Steven King movie ever
<[SWAG]Haku> Cipher eeyup, Beforal Oral
<Punkie_Pue> Sorry to sound like a total newb, but how do i cast my vote?
<[SWAG]Haku> Im going to put Bionicle 2 Legends of Mrtru Nui as my B film in the lottery
<MrPie309> It's the show wher i walk around...and stuff
<DaringDerpy> Punkie_Pue: you have to get the newsletter somehow...in there is the link to the survey
<[SWAG]Haku> Punkie_Pue Subscirbe to the newsletter

<[SWAG]Haku> to sunscirbe
<Punkie_Pue> Thanks. I am not subscribed. Ill get on that.
<[SWAG]Haku> *subscribe
<[SWAG]Haku> Youll get the newsletter in your email weekly, before thursfay
<[SWAG]Haku> I say we all put the same movies in
<[SWAG]Haku> that way, if one of us win, we all win
<DaringDerpy> communist!
<brohoooooooooof> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klELzRprnsQ :D
<Stallion_of_War> Can we vote KHAN?
<[SWAG]Haku> As an A or B?
<fleskywood> HALLO ALL
<fleskywood> SFDG
<fleskywood> DFG
<fleskywood> J
<fleskywood> anyway
<Stallion_of_War> Wouldn't KHAN be an A movie?
<[SWAG]Haku> Then maybe
<fleskywood> dabummmsitt
<DaringDerpy> I won two times to far. Silence of the lambs and Leon. The crowd was pleased.
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku has only ever won once, in the winter
<[SWAG]Haku> twas revenge of the nerds, the b film
<Stallion_of_War> I won Luna Eclipse once
<brohoooooooooof> i like discord
<DaringDerpy> what is the full name of the movie, Stallion_of_War?
<CrystalPhoenix> I won The King's Speech
<[SWAG]Haku> everyone was thanking me for picking that film
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDaKZ6X1oxE&feature=g-vrec
<CrystalPhoenix> I believe it was well received
<PrincessLuna> ohai all
<[SWAG]Haku> I think the lottery is bias somehow
<Stallion_of_War> Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
<Stallion_of_War> I think
<Shizuka> 13which was yours haku?
<thelonepony> Hi PrincessLuna :)
<[SWAG]Haku> Revenge of the Nerds?
<Shizuka> 13oh yes
<Shizuka> 13our best b
<Shizuka> 13evar
<PrincessLuna> how are you tlp?
<[SWAG]Haku> XD
<Gak_is_kinda_back> i thought we where doing a 24 hour streem?
<Slendy> :)
<CrystalPhoenix> Gak_is_kinda_back, who told you that?
<DaringDerpy> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/ 7.7/10 for wrath of the khan....would be one of the better b movies
<Shizuka> 13i mean maybe clue or space mutiny come close but nerds was definitely our best b
<[SWAG]Haku> Now I want a bionicle film to be the b film
<Shizuka> 13mask of light plx
<[SWAG]Haku> Shizuka nice to hear tha :)
<DaringDerpy> space mutiny is awful....except the car chase scenes
<Stallion_of_War> I liked MST3K the best
<Shizuka> 13only one i know of but i remember liking it
<[SWAG]Haku> Mask of Light or Legends of Metru Nui
<[SWAG]Haku> 1 or 2
<[SWAG]Haku> hmmm
<[SWAG]Haku> hard choice
<brohoooooooooof> CRUSH KILL DESTROY SWAG
<brohoooooooooof> :|
<[SWAG]Haku> Light started the film series, but legends, in my opinion, was better
<CrystalPhoenix> also....now that Background Pony is over, what should I read?
<[SWAG]Haku> the first 3 bionicle films are on youtube
<[SWAG]Haku> Cant find 4 anywhere though
<AdamTheDuck> Oh my Bionicles?
<[SWAG]Haku> I bought on demand for my 16th bithday
<DRHUnleashed> i have the first 3 bionicle movies
<AdamTheDuck> Oh man, so many memories!
<[SWAG]Haku> Eeyup
<[SWAG]Haku> I got all 6 Ignikas, one of the best groups
<DRHUnleashed> and a ton of bionicle sets
*AdamTheDuck lost all his bionicles ;~;
<VenHur> What you guys talking about with the dark magic thing?
<AdamTheDuck> I think I still have the first movie on tape though XD
<DRHUnleashed> or at least bionicle parts and sections
<[SWAG]Haku> I have thw 2nd on VHS, and the 3rd on DVD
<Very_berry> The new "hero factory" ones suck, i like the old ones.
<[SWAG]Haku> Hero Factory's been around only 2 or 3 years and they already getting their onw tv series
<NT|TF2> 11,01Nothing is being streamed.
<[SWAG]Haku> not cool bro, not cool
<DRHUnleashed> agreed
<flutterchu> [SWAG]Haku: what's a hero factory?
<[SWAG]Haku> A down grade of Binicle
<[SWAG]Haku> *bionicle
<[SWAG]Haku> Binocle was about warriors in a different universe, about the 6 great protectors working together to overcome evil. Hero Factory is exactly like it sounds
<flutterchu> [SWAG]Haku: what's a bionicle?
<Zamer> superretroworld hey retro you alive?
<superretroworld> Zamer: yeah
<[SWAG]Haku> flutterchu one of LEGOS greatest things
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> [SWAG]Haku: lol so the Bionicle's Toa were the Elements of Harmony :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Basically, yeah
<Decipher> 0,5heehee
<CriticKitten> I liked the original Bionicle.
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Decipher
<[SWAG]Haku> Alone, they werent all that great, but together, they kicked major ass
<Zamer> just letting you know your turn is about to be back up
<CriticKitten> They started getting too complicated and silly though.
<[SWAG]Haku> Not really
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> same here i still have all 6 of the original :3
<CriticKitten> With some of their powers being a bit absurd.
<[SWAG]Haku> the more complicated, the better
<Dashie_Dashie> oh god..
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAVyY-Xhtbg
<CrystalPhoenix> Dashie_Dashie, you're late
<Punkie_Pue> A responce https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEWoQTEjLak
<J_E_Smith71> Speaking of Hero Factory here's a simple video with some guy using the toys to tell a story. I know it's not much but this fellow does the best he can: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYyQxXvwFs&list=PL94394ADBC01F651B&index=7&feature=plpp_video
<J_E_Smith71> Though it's a series so I don't know which part to show
<VenHur> So, um...who loved the Dark Magic concept?
<Zamer> superretroworld your turn is ready
<DerpyMuffins> Pure awsomeness if you were here earlier http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYW2GmHB5xs&feature=g-wl
<[SWAG]Haku> Seriously, how badass was this shit? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZbCsJttSyE
<CrystalPhoenix> you guys know what I want to see on stream?
<Punkie_Pue> how did we like season 3 episode 1 I left right after the stream
<Punkie_Pue> 1+2
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I found it okay.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Not great, but not bad.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<CrystalPhoenix> It had great moments
<Punkie_Pue> I felt the same way. I was little disapointed we didnt see derpy
<pony_6585> Hello:)
<CrystalPhoenix> it's really the villain that is the main downside
<Punkie_Pue> I did like how everypony got a good amount of airtime
<twilight_sprinkle> i particlarly liked that eyjey had more screen time, and a certain pink one had less.. i also liked that spike played a big role
<thelonepony> what ayejay said :3
<CrystalPhoenix> even though I thought he was okay
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Punkie_Pue: Well, Derpy's not really mansatory in an episode.
<J_E_Smith71> It was okay, I think Sombra was the letdown for mos folks
<[SWAG]Haku> brb
<J_E_Smith71> I heard Derpy was there
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Also, I love the fact that Rarity got some pretty good screen time.
<Lijielong> Celestia shot a lot of lasers this episode. Perhaps she was compensating for something?
<Punkie_Pue> All the ponies did.
<J_E_Smith71> Cadence's dramatic faint...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night everyone.
<redraptor369> I loved the gravity spell:)
<CriticKitten> I thought it was sort of poor in the context of prior episodes. But still not BAD and it could be redeemed if it is used well later in this season.
<AttackWithHugs|Zzz> Night, Nittany_Discord
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, Nittany_Discord. :)
<NocturnalBlade> nite Nittany_Discord
<Derpy_Hooves> J_E_Smith71: shopped
<Punkie_Pue> redraptor369: i oved tht part
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Nittany_Discord
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Nittany_Discord
<CrystalPhoenix> but nothing
<Punkie_Pue> night Nittany_Discord
<CrystalPhoenix> beats this moment http://i.imgur.com/38VvT.gif
<HoodyNinja> Ello Ponies
<J_E_Smith71> Derpy_Hooves: Haven't looked into it yet just heard it
<Lijielong> It's ok twilight, you've just doomed us all
<Lijielong> *faint*
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I do love the pun at the end with AJ and Rarity, though. :D
<Punkie_Pue> Awesome gif
<thelonepony> night Nittany_Discord
<Punkie_Pue> What was the pun again?
<Cipher> 0,14so Toonami's been leveling up
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> How so?
<Lijielong> pun?
<Cipher> 0,14they've brought back Tenchi Muyo
<Time> :P
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> NIce!
<Cipher> 0,14and Inuyashi
<HoodyNinja> CrystalPhoenix: Cadenza-pult
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *Nice
<Lijielong> Also, Pinkie-Palooza is now canon
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> say did Shining's horn get fixed at the end? cant remember
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Anyone here ever seen Cyborg 009?
<thelonepony> Nice :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Yep, the curse was broken.
<Punkie_Pue> Sketch_Toku_Brony: yes
<Lijielong> http://sylrepony.deviantart.com/art/Pinkie-Palooza-270556406
<redraptor369> Go Cadance dart!!
<CriticKitten> They brought back Inuyasha?
<NocturnalBlade> CriticKitten: eeyup
<CriticKitten> Didn't that show get played to death already? XD
<HoodyNinja> You mean OG Twilight?
<AttackWithHugs|Zzz> Welpl, heading off to bed. Night, and don't kill each other.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, AttackWithHugs|Zzz. :)
<NocturnalBlade> nite AttackWithHugs|Zzz and we will try not to lol
<CriticKitten> I love it, but still, I think they've shown the season like twenty times
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I'll try not to. :D
<Lijielong> I'm just wondering, has there been any MLP villain that's lasted more than two episodes?
<thelonepony> Night AttackWithHugs|Zzz :)
<HoodyNinja> latas AttackWithHugs|Zzz
<Punkie_Pue> more than 2?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Not as of yet, Lijielong.
<Punkie_Pue> I dont think so.
*AttackWithHugs|Zzz hugs AJIsAwesome|Busy, NocturnalBlade, thelonepony, HoodyNinja, and ruffles Jmo
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87AxVZekZcE
<HoodyNinja> Lijielong: Trixie
*AJIsAwesome|Busy hugs AttackWithHugs|Zzz back "Take care" :)
*thelonepony noms on AttackWithHugs|Zzz :3
*Jmo nuzzles AttackWithHugs|Zzz
<Jmo> Night Fluffeh :3
*HoodyNinja is hugged
<AttackWithHugs|Zzz> Night Jaymoo
<Lijielong> Can't really call Trixie a villain
<J_E_Smith71> Sombra could come back
<HoodyNinja> That villian sucked
<Lijielong> Not when compared to NMM, Discord, or Chrysalis
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I hope he does.
<HoodyNinja> Other than that, great premier
<thelonepony> HoodyNinja!!!!!
<J_E_Smith71> His horn broke off before he exploded, and he can work magic with the detached horn
<HoodyNinja> thelonepony!
<HoodyNinja> I've been here :I
*thelonepony hugs HoodyNinja :3
<Lijielong> and another demonstration of Celestia's astounding ineptitude
<Zamer> superretroworld
<J_E_Smith71> Or his horn was all that was left
*Kurra soooo fulllll
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Also, the whole "dark magic" concept is still a mystery.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> We also know that Celestia's capable of it (as well as Twilight), which brings up some interesting questions on what Celestia knows about magic.
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome|Busy: They kinda set themselves up for a consistent theme with the new season, maybe it will gt explained
<CrystalPhoenix> what caught my interest was the book Luna pulled out at the end
<HoodyNinja> ^
<Lijielong> She knows how to shoot lasers
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrystalPhoenix: Same.
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVMuMZ2bILU
<Lijielong> that seems about it
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I wonder what that book is/contains.
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Busy, what got me curious was the logo
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> What was it?
<Punkie_Pue> I wonder if the episodes will related to previous ones. Seeing as we have as short season
<Punkie_Pue> more so than before
<Shizuka> 13a proper arc would be nice
<CrystalPhoenix> hold on
<Shizuka> 1313-ep anime does it all the time
<Shizuka> 13maybe they caught on
<twilight_sprinkle> also, spike technically saved the world. i think thats pretty awesome
<Punkie_Pue> Shizuka: Well said
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Maybe this season will be one big arc season.
<Shizuka> 13we won't know til next week anyway
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: Agreed. Spike got a lot of love.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Wait
<HoodyNinja> I love spike
<AdamTheDuck> Spike \:3/
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this.
<HoodyNinja> Spike is awesome
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Hc3II0Akw
<Lijielong> I love how Shining armor just hurled his bride at spike
<HoodyNinja> Spike will kill you for fun
<Lijielong> that automatically redeems him
<DerpyMuffins> 2 episode down, 11 to go
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Shizuka: Are you fine with us discussing this or do you want us to wait till tomorrow?
<Shizuka> 13go forit
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ok.
<twilight_sprinkle> Lijielong: wouldve been interesting if he missed and threw her into a wall
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome|Busy: No one's said a thing so far :I
<Shizuka> 13we're discussing when the spoiler blanket should fall
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Got it.
<Lijielong> Nah, she would have glided away
<Pegasister> i hate instagram stalkers -.-
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> One thing I never knew was that Cadance was originally going to be a unicorn.
<HoodyNinja> I thought Luna would secretly travel to help Twilight Sparkle, since she wasn't entirely convinced of her ability
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SLMA4Yy8g4
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone wonder HOW Sombra raised to power?
<Punkie_Pue> I just realized i forgot the rule about spoilers
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DerpyMuffins: Me.
<Punkie_Pue> Sorry
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Busy, http://i.imgur.com/7HQPN.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> i think itd be best if spoilers werent allowed til its shown ehre again, imo
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> twilight_sprinkle: agreed lol about time they made Spike epic :D
<CrystalPhoenix> please describe the content of the logo
<Shizuka> 13last season it was usually sunday morning, i forget if we bumped it down to after euro movie night when we re-air
<Shizuka> 13which btw we'll be working on that tomorrow <<
<Lijielong> I thought so too. What's up with the cold shoulder Luna gave Twi?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrystalPhoenix: Stars and swirls? What abou-
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> WAIT
<CrystalPhoenix> exactly
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
<Shizuka> 13yeah reddit's been that far for hours :3
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: And you still haven't seen it so i feel dirty giving it away in front of you
<CrystalPhoenix> indubitably AJIsAwesome|Busy
<Shizuka> 13eh, i never care about spoilers
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome|Busy: that more oreos are required?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<HoodyNinja> I don't see beards on that book :I
<Buytoast> not too much to spoil
<Shizuka> 13unless you sat down and typed out the entire episode, i know there's more than people tell me
<flutterchu> OBJECTION http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX7N7YtPfL0
<Buytoast> just a bunch of mary sue shinanigans
<DerpyMuffins> Inb4 Twilight becoming Alicorn is canon
<Shizuka> 13everyone knows rosebud is his sled, how many people know what the rest of the movie was
<HoodyNinja> That would be terrible
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Shizuka: you spoiled the movie for me
<Shizuka> 13*IF* they're building a twilight training arc, it will necessarily be fleshing out a lot about luna in the process
<twilight_sprinkle> twilight should stay unicorn, but become ruler
<Pegasister> I hate instagram stalkerssssss D:
<Shizuka> 13quite likely as a response to the previous two seasons doing nothing with luna
<Pegasister> ._.
<pony_insertnumberher> Bruce Willis was dead Aerith Dies Soylent Green is people It was actually Earth She's actually a dude
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> has anyone Operation Stranglehold or its sequel A Better Tommorow? pretty good stories plus some Metal Gear Solid 3 references :D hope to see Crab Battle soon
<Pegasister> im so random
<Pegasister> xD
<Shizuka> 13wait which is that last
<Buytoast> purple magic is probably going to become the next queen horse
<Shizuka> 13it was earth is planet of the apes, which is she's a dude?
<twilight_sprinkle> purple horse is MLG

<twilight_sprinkle> 42!
<HoodyNinja> >.>
<HoodyNinja> <.<
<Shizuka> 13if it gets choppy does it stutter or does it just show a lower framerate?
<twilight_sprinkle> it was choppy?
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Quick_Thinker> not seeing a stream currently Shizu
<HoodyNinja> I don't pay attention to the crysis streams :I
<Shizuka> 13well at least at the finale
<Shizuka> 13some of the water effects had it chugging down around 15fps
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ...ok thats just stupid! :D
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, i dont remember im afraid
<CrystalPhoenix> since we can still post spoilers http://youtu.be/ewpMsy2x75I
<Rex_Mundi> Hello everypony!
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh, I wasn't there for that stream then
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Rex_Mundi
<Quick_Thinker> i refreshed and still no stream drat
<Shizuka> 13i ask because i'm not sure how often gta4 holds above 30fps, especially if dxtory is latched on
<thelonepony> Hi Rex_Mundi :)
<Shizuka> 13so dunno if it would be choppy or if you would see the same framerate i do
<HoodyNinja> CrystalPhoenix: Wait, the ep is out, how is it spoilers?
<HoodyNinja> Oh wait
<HoodyNinja> Nvm
<twilight_sprinkle> oi hoodi, u r so dum :I
<HoodyNinja> oy Rex_Mundi, how goes life
<Rex_Mundi> goes life good!
<HoodyNinja> shuddap spriggles im smartur ten u
<Punkie_Pue> What was our favorite song in the episode?
<Rex_Mundi> Can we talk about the season 3 commercials?
<twilight_sprinkle> okay u convinsd me ;~;
<thelonepony> oi' stop startin' you two :I
<HoodyNinja> GAK
<CrystalPhoenix> Punkie_Pue, the reprise of the test song
<Buytoast> none of the songs were particularly good
<DRHUnleashed> gak gak gak
<twilight_sprinkle> the twi one was cute as hell though
<HoodyNinja> oy stop moderating tehlownponeh
<Rex_Mundi> Buytoast: Crystal fair is excellent
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh
<HoodyNinja> Do you think Twilight was prepared?
<twilight_sprinkle> when i saw the twi song originally, i thought it was about her failing an actual test, which i thought wouldve been a great lesson
<Punkie_Pue> Twilight was not prepared!
<[SWAG]Haku> for a test, yes, for a saving the world ordeal, no
<HoodyNinja> Those songs were... eh
<thelonepony> oi' stop startin hoodienhja
<NocturnalBlade> HoodyNinja: to blow up her house? hell yea :D
<pony_insertnumberher> She wasn't prepared for this~
<Quick_Thinker> oh boy
<HoodyNinja> Neh
<HoodyNinja> Once I start I can't stop
<thelonepony> :I
<twilight_sprinkle> wel start stopin hoodi :I
<HoodyNinja> >:I
<twilight_sprinkle> :K
<HoodyNinja> okay spriggles
<HoodyNinja> i will
<HoodyNinja> ...
*twilight_sprinkle speech 26
<Quick_Thinker> failure happens sometimes would make a great lesson for the show
<HoodyNinja> I can't believe this isn't old yet
<Punkie_Pue> What isn't old?
<[SWAG]Haku> what isnt old yet?
<HoodyNinja> Quick_Thinker: It hasn't?
<HoodyNinja> Yet*
<Schi> how long has it been since "gak" was relevent in the chat?
<CrystalPhoenix> but the lesson in this double episode was self-sacrifice
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: yeah thats what i thought. i thought itd be about her just blatanlty failing a test with no excuses, and learning to accept it. imo thats a very important lesson
<[SWAG]Haku> about 13 hours
<[SWAG]Haku> The lesson wasn't very well played
<Schi> then it must be safe
<HoodyNinja> Who else hated the villian?
<CrystalPhoenix> also best Crystal Pony http://fav.me/d5kpaff
<Rex_Mundi> So can we talk about the season 3 commercials or is that spoilers?
<HoodyNinja> I hated this guy more than Chrysalis
<[SWAG]Haku> HoodyNinja I got into this earlier about how he wasnt a good villaian
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: spoilers for future eps no
<HoodyNinja> [SWAG]Haku: He's not
<J_E_Smith71> Rex_Mundi: Don't mention a certain Pinkie moment
<[SWAG]Haku> HoodyNinja I know, I said he wasn't
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrystalPhoenix: I have that saved as my favorites. I do have to say, her crystal design was fantastic.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol cant believe Shining getting his magic cut off by those crystals ALREADY someone made a joke fic of it being somekind of Horn Transmitted Disease from Sombra...WTF?!
<Rex_Mundi> Nor certain equine companions of Celestia I take it as well
<Quick_Thinker> so any pictures of Crystal MAne 6?
<J_E_Smith71> Quick_Thinker: Yep, use the MLP Wiki
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Ya don't seem too busy o_O
<[SWAG]Haku> But if Sombra just got more lines, screen time, and actual participating with the mane 6, he would have been cool
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> HoodyNinja: Just came back to see what chat's doing.
<Punkie_Pue> I need to this again. I don't remember half the episode.
<Punkie_Pue> see
<HoodyNinja> Eh, he coulda used some more lines, but I don't like his design or his voice
<thelonepony> Get back to work AJIsAwesome|Busy >:I
<twilight_sprinkle> ok lets see if this fails again
<Quick_Thinker> Haku Sombra would have more screen time its just the shield was kinding of blocking all of it
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :<
<flutterchu> im back, i just hope everyone's done talking about...it.......
<Rex_Mundi> [SWAG]Haku: Maybe Sombra will come back?
<[SWAG]Haku> One of my biggest tics about the episode was it all being some sort of test
*twilight_sprinkle slaps AJIsAwesome|Busy around a bit with a large trout
<[SWAG]Haku> Yes, Rex_Mindu, me and someone else talked about this
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ;~;
<[SWAG]Haku> What if Sombra secretly controlled the rest of Season3 so that he could show up in the season finale
<HoodyNinja> [SWAG]Haku: Yes, "Okay Twilight, if you pass, good for you, if you fail, everyone you know will die"
<twilight_sprinkle> say AJIsAwesome|Busy remove your busy for a sec pls
*thelonepony smacks twilight_sprinkle with the chancla >:I
<CrystalPhoenix> HoodyNinja, let me guess you want him to have this kind of design http://i.imgur.com/N10sI.png and have him speak in a mexican accent?
<[SWAG]Haku> HoodyNinja I said almost the exact same thing
<HoodyNinja> Twould be better
*twilight_sprinkle slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
*AdamTheDuck slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large thelonepony
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol i LOVE the Assassin's Creed/Season 3 banner :D
<AJIsAwesome> :<
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: hm ok thanks :D
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<HoodyNinja> Ew, what smells?
<Rex_Mundi> *huggies AJIsAwesome*
<HoodyNinja> It stinks in here
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: u
*AJIsAwesome hugs Rex_Mundi. :)
<Quick_Thinker> well im glad im not getting slapped
<[SWAG]Haku> I didnt want a goofy villain, we got discord for that, but nor did I want a pony who just didnt get what they deserved, like NMM
<HoodyNinja> No, no, we need more lemon pledge
<[SWAG]Haku> I wanted an actual villain, someone whos evil just to be evil
<HoodyNinja> So, you wanted more chrysalis?
<Quick_Thinker> ^ thats a cliche villian
<Rex_Mundi> [SWAG]Haku: Few good villains are evil just to be evil
<[SWAG]Haku> Chrysalis wasnt evil, she was doing her duty as queen
<Quick_Thinker> crysallis i didnt find evil she needs to feed her people or else they die
<Shizuka> 13from what i hear the new villain wasn't really much of a character at all?
<Buytoast> nope
<Shizuka> 13just shows up to provide plot tension?
<Shizuka> 13promptly defeated?
<Quick_Thinker> kind of really no choice on chrysis part
<[SWAG]Haku> Shizuka You got that right
<Buytoast> he was The Lich King mixed with Smokey the Bear
<CrystalPhoenix> Megabyte was evil cause he was program to be
<Shizuka> 13that's why chrysalis was better
<HoodyNinja> Taking over a country instead of living like you've always lived? Seems kinda evil
<pony_insertnumberher> pretty much
<CrystalPhoenix> and DANG is he a great Villain
<[SWAG]Haku> Here's the Order of Villains
<Rex_Mundi> Shizuka: More like sauron in that he is trying to come back but just cant due to circumstances
<[SWAG]Haku> Discord
<[SWAG]Haku> Nightmare Moon
<[SWAG]Haku> Chrysalis
<Shizuka> 13yes chrysalis kind of comes out of nowhere at the end of part 1 canterlot wedding, but that she was there is plausible
<[SWAG]Haku> Every other antagonist form the show
<Buytoast> Captain Sombrero
<[SWAG]Haku> And at the bottom is Sombra
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol We need Elements of Harmony NOW! *MMPR theme* http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-92oEeb_lgis/T7AYiRxG30I/AAAAAAAApnk/P1vRGzlcSxk/s1600/185270+-+artist+needsmoarg4+g1+g1_to_g4+Green_Ranger+masquerade+Power_Rangers.png
<HoodyNinja> Buytoast: :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Sombra HAD potential, he was an actual evil guy!
<Shizuka> 13if they're setting this guy up to be a recurring problem, and the episode titles through december really don't suggest it much, they haven't started on the right foot
<Quick_Thinker> plus Discord and Chrysi had more of a Backstory this one we have no clue why he is evil they just say "HEART AS BLACK AS NIGHT"
<thelonepony> Buytoast: :D
<JRP2234> wow 4000 people was insase
<JRP2234> insane*
<[SWAG]Haku> But the way he was presented just wasnt very good
<CrystalPhoenix> Chrysalis had no Backstory whatsoever
<CrystalPhoenix> and Sombra had one
<[SWAG]Haku> Quick_Thinker Actuall they had little to no background
<HoodyNinja> Chrysalis was a pretty good villian, I just think she was overrated
<Shizuka> 13luna was part of the core mythos of the world in episode 1, discord was an escaped villain, chrysalis was a spy that spent a whole episode building herself up
<[SWAG]Haku> Discord was a spirit of chaos turned to stone by Celestia and Luna
<[SWAG]Haku> THATS HIS ACTUAL STORY RIGHT THERE
<Shizuka> 13i'm talking just in portrayal in the show anyway
<Rex_Mundi> Tirak was Tirak, and had Dragons 'n stuff
<[SWAG]Haku> Chrysalis was a Twist
<HoodyNinja> BTW, was Sombra defeated by Celestia and Luna?
<CrystalPhoenix> Sombra was a unicorn filled with hatred
<Shizuka> 13for all three of them they existed in the world and were more slowly brought in
<Quick_Thinker> Hoody no Spike defeated him
<DerpyMuffins> You guys are taking things way too seriously
<Zamer> Anyone up for a game of Board Game http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSLU
<[SWAG]Haku> He was defeated by them 1000 years ago
<Quick_Thinker> SPIKE
<DerpyMuffins> Lighten up
<[SWAG]Haku> but then he came back
<TROctavia> another game pls
<[SWAG]Haku> This is PONIES
<Shizuka> 13this guy seems to have come from nowhere just to provide tension for this opener, even if he returns later in the season
<Buytoast> Admiral Sombrero "Smokey LeRogue" Smokeyton was locked away by the two queen horses
<CrystalPhoenix> though that's one thing that does get on my nerve
<CrystalPhoenix> why 1000 years?
<[SWAG]Haku> We NEED t take it seriously
<DerpyMuffins> Dont you think you are overthinking this a little bit?
<CrystalPhoenix> it's always 1000 years
<HoodyNinja> Quick_Thinker: No, in the beggining, when Celestia is explaining the Crystal Empire to Twilight, there is an image of the princesses defeating him
<Zamer> Whose up for a Extremely fun game all are welcome to join Board Game Online http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSLU
<Quick_Thinker> oh you mean the past
<HoodyNinja> Discord was more than 1000 years
<Quick_Thinker> i tohught you mean who defeated him at the end
<TROctavia> Come join it guys, everyone dies of Aids and such
<Shizuka> 13it's always 1000 years, nice round number that ensures the general population won't remember
<HoodyNinja> Discord never had a time period
<[SWAG]Haku> The empire dissapeard 1000 years ago, before Luna went dark, and Celestia still knows almost nothing about the empire
<Shizuka> 13face it, how many of you know what went on in 1000 AD
<[SWAG]Haku> King Arther, the crusades
<HoodyNinja> Shizuka: Do you?
<[SWAG]Haku> etc etc
<CrazyHippie> Hi guys!
<Buytoast> people weren't washing their hands and were executed for questioning the church
<Buytoast> BAM
<CriticKitten> I'm betting that there were things happening in 1000 AD.
<HoodyNinja> That was more 12th century
<Rex_Mundi> Shizuka: Uhh.... Hawaii was first setteled... Roman empire was falling...
<sonicdude558> hello CrazyHippie
<CriticKitten> Things and stuff.
<Quick_Thinker> 1000 AD a bit much
<Mutterguy> there was that war that happened in 1066
<JRP2234> GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK
<Zamer> 8 Spots left for Board Game Online come join now http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSLU
<CrazyHippie> Hi sonicdude558.Are we just making cospiracies?
<Shizuka> 13but you get the idea
<JRP2234> Why you obsesed with gak
<sonicdude558> idk whats going on
<[SWAG]Haku> But from what we know, Equestrua wasnt much different 1000 years ago
<Rex_Mundi> GAK
<JRP2234> All i see is GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK
<Shizuka> 13except for people that study history, the general public nowadays doesn't know what happened 1000 years ago
<sonicdude558> I am going to say this
<sonicdude558> FUCK
<sonicdude558> GAK
<J_E_Smith71> HoodyNinja: I think Chyraslis had the element of suprise on her side too, we knew about Sombra and expected a bunch from him. Chrys on the other hand we weren't expecting at all so when she was revealed we were so exicted over her (Just look at the reaction vids, everyone was like HOLY CRAP NEW VILLIAN), plus the Changeling fight was epic
<CriticKitten> Why would you want to do that, sonicdude558?
<HoodyNinja> Spike didn't defeat Sombra, he delivered the crystal heart :I
<[SWAG]Haku> Shizuka Celestia said no one knew about it, but Celestia WAS THERE
<twilight_sprinkle> the only reason chrysalis was plausible is because they gave her the OP abilitty to transform into anyone
<Phase4> 00,02is there anything on stream?
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Shizuka> 13not atm
<Buytoast> nope
<twilight_sprinkle> i hate it when shows d othat..
<Quick_Thinker> which in turn Hoody allowed him to be defeated
<Rex_Mundi> My guess is that there were/are tribes of ponies besides the 3 that made Equestria.
<[SWAG]Haku> When the Empre WENR AWAY
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: Yes, but he was one of the main contributers of saving the empire.
<Shizuka> 13thought of doing gta4 but it's raining pretty good here
<sonicdude558> who pinged me
<Zamer> Shizuka you should play Board Game Online :D
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 moo
<Shizuka> 13i've played before
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: Moo o.o
<Quick_Thinker> u do GTA 4 can i join :D
<Buytoast> i guess you could say that Captain Sombrone's plan...
<Quick_Thinker> i have it on steam
<HoodyNinja> BTW what was up with Cadence being called "The Crystal Princess" at the end? Am I the only one who caught that?
<Buytoast> WENT UP IN SMOKE
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 check your skype
<[SWAG]Haku> ^^
<nick> YEEEEAAAAHHHHH
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: :D
*Ponies47 Noms on SuperBrony64 's head
<CrystalPhoenix> I say that Shinning is the true hero http://i.imgur.com/38VvT.gif
<CrystalPhoenix> I'll never get tired of that gif
<JRP2234> lets all hug phase4
<LunasGuard> well nite everypony
<Buytoast> it's probably just more mary sue set up HoodyNinja
<sonicdude558> after all these years...
*JRP2234 hugs Phase4
<HoodyNinja> Buytoast: Yes, but what for?
<Punkie_Pue> amazing gif
<NocturnalBlade> CrystalPhoenix: best throw ever...of all time :D
*SuperBrony64 is nommed on D:
<Rex_Mundi> My timeline. Medieval equestria- Kingdom of Equestria- Discord takes over- Celestia and Luna become new Rulers of Equestria after thery defeat Discord- Luna is banished- Luna is freed (modern period)
*sonicdude558 throws 50 chewable twi plushies into the chat
<Buytoast> to make a royal coronation toy event or something
<sonicdude558> flutterchu this is for you
<CrystalPhoenix> HoodyNinja, Cadence IS the crystal princess if that wasn't obvious enough
<Buytoast> anything that sounds impressive can sell sell sell
<CrystalPhoenix> cutie mark, hair
<flutterchu> sonicdude558: why>
<Buytoast> and they could make a queen cadance toy line and shit
<flutterchu> 8?
<[SWAG]Haku> The whole episode was just poorly written, I think we can all agree on that
<J_E_Smith71> It would have been a better twist if Shining had been been possesed by Sombra at the beginning and Sombra was using Shining as a vessel
<Buytoast> with king armor
<flutterchu> */
<flutterchu> *?
<Buytoast> really it's all about how much they can milk out of the concept
<HoodyNinja> [SWAG]Haku: I liked how it was written, just not the villian
<Punkie_Pue> That would felt like the royal canterlot episode
*flutterchu noms on twi plushie
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Please don't talk about Season 3 episodes until 24 hours have passed after their air time.
*flutterchu nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom

*flutterchu noms on 11 more
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: So pictures aren't allowed either?
<[SWAG]Haku> Like how the songs really didnt match the episode at all
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsAwesome: No.
<AJIsAwesome> OK.
<[SWAG]Haku> The Test song was about a test that wasnt really a test
<AJIsAwesome> *Ok
*flutterchu f**king noms on all of them
<Rex_Mundi> Also, Bronycon is moving to Baltimore Maryland... Great, i have to drive ever further to get to Bronycon!
*flutterchu nom nom nom nom nom nom

<DerpyMuffins> Cya everypony
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Final warning, please stop talking about the episode that aired this morning.
<[SWAG]Haku> And the test wasnt a test because it was about saving the world instead of getting a grade
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, DerpyMuffins. :)
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64: We've been talking about with Shizuka (who hasn't seen it) for the past 30 mins and she didn't say anything
<sonicdude558> bye DerpyMuffins

<Quick_Thinker> J_E dont argue with an admin it wount end well
<Shizuka> 13because dari crashed
<sonicdude558> dari hari wari mari
<[SWAG]Haku> The villain was poorly wriiten, we hardly got any thing about friendship at all since it was about Twilight and not about togetehrness
<MakerDusk> arguing with admins never ends well
*flutterchu nom nom nom nom nom nom
<MakerDusk> one warning and then termination
<MrPie309> sauce
*flutterchu swalloes
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: True, but we still have the rule in place.
<[SWAG]Haku> A lot more things than that, I cant name them all off the top of my head
<Shizuka> 13fair enough
<MakerDusk> we also remember issued warnings
<Quick_Thinker> Haku the focus of the lesson was on Twilight not exactly her friends
<sonicdude558> ¿ʇı ʇǝb
<CrystalPhoenix> Welp
<HoodyNinja> [SWAG]Haku: Yes, but the test could be used to set up Twilight for later things, and the Royal Wedding was about Twilight too
<nick> in b4 spike is an alicorn
<Rex_Mundi> MakerDusk: Wow, who knew the Bronystate admins were powerful enough to send a terminater... Is Bronystate Skynet?
<CrystalPhoenix> discussion is over
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's to protect those who haven't see it yet.
<Shizuka> 13maker is a tx
<sonicdude558> Someone call the Doctor! someone has swallowed a plushie!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Next message about the episode is getting a 24 hour ban.
<JRP2234> yay
<sonicdude558> :O
<[SWAG]Haku> HoodyNinja But the wedding didnt have anything to do with friendship, this whole thing was suppose to involve her firends, bu they all became background ponies
<HoodyNinja> The ep was good
<Mutterguy> OMG SB being srs!
<Punkie_Pue> Has anyone played the MLP game from gameloft?
<JRP2234> listen to him or be huged for a year
<Punkie_Pue> It any good?
<MakerDusk> there is currently a large group in #derpibooru that have had their warning... patience, Dusky, patience
<Shizuka> 13one minor gripe about this keyboard, delete key seems to get stuck
<sub06905> i liek it :3
<Derpy_Hooves> what are we talking about? o3o
<sonicdude558> Has anyone played the MLP game from your mom?
<Shizuka> 13not stuck and repeating, just stuck down
<[SWAG]Haku> And you even said so yourself HoodyNinja, "If you fail the test, Twilight, everyone dies."
<Shizuka> 13but hey backspace works and the volume control works, i'm happy
<sonicdude558> protip
<[SWAG]Haku> What kind of test is that?!
<sonicdude558> Ctrl A selects a
<sonicdude558> all
<pony_4704> hello
<AJIsAwesome> [SWAG]Haku: We should move on.
<Rex_Mundi> Imagine if Season 3 DIDDN'T have ponies?...
<sonicdude558> herro pony_4704
<AJIsAwesome> *from the topic
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64
<Rex_Mundi> It would be the Discord and Spike show...
<Ratlan> Sounds like a wacky sitcom
<otakon> So anyone download the new ep yet?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<sonicdude558> no
<sonicdude558> I want a iTunes rip :P
<Mutterguy> Don't forget the pets or the buffalo or or Griffons and diamond dogs
<otakon> Rex_Mundi: hmmm it wouldn't be MLP then it would be ...ML...
<CrystalPhoenix> I believe I'll wait for the iTune rip

"But she's my friend," she mumbled."Think how many more friends you will have when my glory shines across Equestria!" the World's Largest Custard insisted. A thin pink glaze bubbled and cracked across its surface.Gummy blinked, but

<Alchemist> They should add a sunday driver mode, where cops pull you over for breaking basic laws, like running a red light, speeding etc.
<DaringDerpy> you drive like a woman
<Emil> twilight_sprinkle: That also works.
<Native-Warrior> FUCK U ROMAN
<Alchemist> wanna go bowling?
<Emil> Ey cousin!
<Emil> Wanna go bowlin g?
<turp> gak
<twilight_sprinkle> lolwut, im pretty sure they dont show anything from america in serbia
<thisguy> ah hell no :|
<thisguy> you did not just mention the name :|
<Native-Warrior> >:I
<Native-Warrior> >:(
<DaringDerpy> serbia doesn't know about al bundy?
<Native-Warrior> :l
<Native-Warrior> :/
<Native-Warrior> >:/
<Native-Warrior> :)
<Native-Warrior> :f
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont know about el bundi either
<Alchemist> yeah, eastern europe is stuck in the stone age...
<twilight_sprinkle> serbia in particular blames the west for everything
<twilight_sprinkle> people raised there are grown to become nationalistic
<Alchemist> I thought they blame croatia for everything
<Shizuka> 13Native-Warrior: Do not spam.
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: croatia, albania, and the west
<thisguy> and none of "that" which must not be spoken
<thisguy> :|
<DaringDerpy> well, nato attacked them, bombed their infrastructure, slaughtered civilians, armed terrorists
<Emil> Dat screen.
<Native-Warrior> So when do we get some more pony stuff?
<AJIsAwesome> Native-Warrior: Go to youtube for that.
<twilight_sprinkle> well, serbia commited genocide against croatia
<Emil> Native-Warrior: There are other things you know.
<AdamTheDuck> Native-Warrior, eww ponies >.>
<twilight_sprinkle> and also against albanians i think
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies, gaaaaaaaaay
<Emil> AdamTheDuck: IKR, who watches stuff like that?
<DaringDerpy> everyone committed genocide in this war
<Emil> AdamTheDuck: Imagine if there were like grown men watching it too!
<Native-Warrior> Isnt it supposed to be playing 24/7?
<Alchemist> Yeah I think in the conflict the serbians were the aggressors, but Im not really sure.
<DeathStar> DaringDerpy: well it is a war... that's what they're all about
<AJIsAwesome> Streams, yes.
<AdamTheDuck> Native-Warrior, 24/7 ponies? Oh my
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies. no.
<AJIsAwesome> They stream when they feel like it.
<Emil> ^
<Native-Warrior> Weird
<thisguy> ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: well asking them sure wont help, theyll never admit to it
<AdamTheDuck> Native-Warrior, Why aren't there ponies on the stream?
<AdamTheDuck> We dont stream My Little Pony all day every day, because not all bronies want to see My Little Pony 24/7. We show FiM-related material plenty of times throughout the week. Bronystates main goal is to provide entertainment for all bronies.
<Emil> Ask for ponies, get G 3.6
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9emjalsOsE
<DaringDerpy> DeathStar: not really...it was a proxy between russia and nato...fueling the ethnic tensions was not necessary...but they did it
<AJIsAwesome> What AdamTheDuck said.
<Native-Warrior> Ooohhh I see.
<Native-Warrior> Fair enough.
<turp> gimme summa dat ParagonX9
<AdamTheDuck> Also I suggest you read http://www.bronystate.net/faq/ and http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<thisguy> speaking of G3. i'll never get that image out of my head
<Native-Warrior> How the fuck does a Russian sound like a rastaman?
<thisguy> dont ask x.x
<AdamTheDuck> Not so much FAQ, but rules are a must.
<thisguy> ooh, impossible game OST :)
<Native-Warrior> this is an honest question
<pony_2630> killa ll athe niggers
<DeathStar> DaringDerpy: I'm to tired to talk about this stuff ^^; but the bottom line is all wars suck and are best avoided
<Afflict> and while we're on that topic http://soundcloud.com/sadhudubstep/gangnam-style-sadhu-remix
<twilight_sprinkle> its funny, if you doubt that a serbian is telling the truth, he immediately assumes youre a croat or albanian
<Kimori> lol
<DaringDerpy> kk
<Kimori> I just needed to watch something to perk me up
<thisguy> dem blood tire marks
<Emil> I have problems hearing what he's saying.
<Emil> Just me?
<twilight_sprinkle> the serbian government just forces nationalism, serbs that are smart enough to overcome it are pretty nice people, they say its hard to live there if you dont agree with the nationalism
<Cipher> 0,14well, I'm headed off to bed
<Cipher> 0,14good night everyone and enjoy the stream
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Cipher
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Cipher

<Alchemist> good night Cipher !
<moobull69> !topic
<Alchemist> I havent actually met any serbs and I havent been there yet, just passed through it so I cant really have a first hand opinion about this

<PrincessMolestiaWHOD> GOODNIGHT!

<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: serbs also seem very nice, until you disagree with them. them all shit breaks loose
<OneTrickCrystalPony> Hai everyone^_^
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, OneTrickCrystalPony. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: at least on matters ive mentioned before, its just their government that makes them be very defensive
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai OneTrickCrystalPony
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi OneTrickCrystalPony
<Alchemist> twilight_sprinkle: well I would assume that is true for any country
<Jmo> All these people with Crystal in their name.
<Jmo> So creative.
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: well not to this extent, their extent is rather frightening
<twilight_sprinkle> creestal jaymoo
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 is a cow
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Stormy season premiere was alright.
<Alchemist> twilight_sprinkle: disagree with a hungarian about gypsies, disagree with an american about social healthcare etc. And remember its quite different onlline than in person.
<DeathStar> JRP2234: no he's a pony. he's just a very confused pony
<turp> nightgood
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: i agree about the online thing, but like i said, even the serbs that arent nationalistic say so
<Alchemist> twilight_sprinkle: every country has its sensitive topic
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: i know, im just discussing the serbian government
<DeathStar> hmm... I wonder what a new zealanders sencitive topic is...
<Alchemist> DeathStar: dunno
<DeathStar> people thinking we're aussies is probably it! :P

<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<Canadian_Brony> Jeez dude, do you not know the term "Sleep"?
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Sumica : do rest please
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, ^ for your own good.
<Canadian_Brony> or "Rest"? "Relaxation"? "Doing absolutely nothing for the hell of it"?
<Sumica> 00,10Unfortunatly I am past the rest phase, need to carry on till I would normaly sleep now cause my body thinks it's time to be up
<AdamTheDuck> Pfft, screw your internal clock
<AdamTheDuck> just rest.
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Sumica : just take it easy please
<Sumica> 00,10all i would end up doing is laying down till I would normaly sleep
<Canadian_Brony> better than on-and-off sleep with freakin' cold symptoms. Stupid flu shot...
<Buytoast> your eternal clock can wait
<Alchemist> its not good. Waking up at 6 in the evening throws you off balance big time
<Sumica> 00,10I cant force my self to sleep early
<Buytoast> you can with nyquil
<Buytoast> or a very large mallet
<Sumica> 00,10only think that will knock me out requires a prescription
<Time> cone

<Zack> Hey Sumica! Lets go bowling!
<SpeccyRush> most of you are thinking sumi is insane, but you would be wrong
<Sumica> 00,10dont need meds for that
<Canadian_Brony> The f-word can be very misleading to a teenage mind.
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Sumica and horny nah never
<Buytoast> you know what they say
<Afflict> night
<Buytoast> A pill in the mouth makes your mind travel south.
<Kimori_NapTime> night
<Alchemist> Buytoast: roofies?
<XAX> Didn't ArchieV do a remix of BBBFF?
<Canadian_Brony> many people did a remix of BBBFF
<Mistress_RainBowDash> XAX : dont know but i hope he does
<Canadian_Brony> and every other song in MLP with lyrics
<Zack> Dj WUBS will be coffiee equivilent
<XAX> I swore he did. Apparently he took down all his pone music, though.
<XAX> I'm almost certain he did one. Pretty sure it was one of the first BBBFF remixes after the episode...
<Canadian_Brony> well, you know what they say
<Canadian_Brony> "x"
<Canadian_Brony> "x everywhere"
<Zack> Borning stream is boring

<AdamTheDuck> That's the symbol for VCL
<AJIsAwesome> pony_4908: Doubt it.

<Shizuka> 13he crashed off after the b movie
<Shizuka> 13apparently he still isn't around
<AJIsAwesome> So he doesn't know?

<AJIsAwesome> Yep. :D
<Malavolent> Weaklings.
<Malavolent> We don't need them.
<Amu-chan> It has to be, since I don't know of a connection between Donkey Kong video games and Aki Toyosaki...
<Afflict> Well they both exist, so there's a connection
<Malavolent> !cd

<naturesfury> o havent played this this in a looong time
<Jmo> ojeez Sins of the solar empire. Always wanted to check this out
<AJIsAwesome> When will you be streaming the recent S3 premiere since dari didn't?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Sumica
<Jmo> No questions for you Ayejay.
<AJIsAwesome> :<
<Jmo> :>
<AJIsAwesome> ;~;
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: I love that ptfo means so many things
<AdamTheDuck> Pass the fuck out?
<SpeccyRush> more or less
<AdamTheDuck> I know it by "play the fucking objective".
<Jmo> Adam you know nothing.
<Jmo> :>
<Buytoast> please the fat overlord
*AdamTheDuck slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Buytoast> punch the fat orangutan
<Buytoast> so who's playin Spore
<AdamTheDuck> Buytoast, Sumi is playing Sins of a Solar Empire
<Buytoast> guess they ripped off that last level of Spore
<Afflict> back
<Jmo> SoAE came out before Spore.
<Jmo> So point made invalid.
<Amu-chan> Welcome back!
<naturesfury> actually that was his 1st planat he found :(
<Jmo> SoSE*
<Afflict> thanks
<Buytoast> just because something was made first doesn't mean it can't rip off the thing made after it
<Jmo> Oh yeah cause they totally wanted to steal content from another game.
<Afflict> I've been thinking about starting a spyro blog
<Amu-chan> Oh?
<Afflict> Dunno if I should
<Afflict> I'd probably just post spyro fanart and about other stuff going on in the spyro community
<Amu-chan> Ah.
<Afflict> I might just do it and see how it goes
<Afflict> It would help though if the spyro community was more active
<Amu-chan> Yeah... Sometimes it's hard to validate starting something like that if there isn't an incredible amount of activity within the community it relates to.
*AdamTheDuck rolls around ded chat
<Afflict> I think it would be kinda fun though, if I had some followers
<AJIsAwesome> :D
*XAX would rather not roll around, because he's in he'd and he just made it
<XAX> he's in bed*
<XAX> : |
<SpeccyRush> XAX you're drunk go home
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Amu-chan> Yeah.
<XAX> SpeccyRush: XD that was le funny
<XAX> I am home.
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Shizuschlafen
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, Shizuschlafen. :)
<Amu-chan> Anywho, I'm going to head off now, if I don't go watch any anime now, I'm risking starting a streak of two nights in a row without watching any anime!
<Afflict> haha night

<Phase4> 00,02wonder if it was intentional
<Mr_Anybody> dat patrick
<AJIsAwesome> They've already made remixes of it.
<Cypresswolf> :) Ignorance is bliss as far as gak goes - glad I didn't take my computer to the meetup afterall - weren't that many outlets in that room anyways
<AJIsAwesome> THey've even made a Winter Gak Up. :S
<Mr_Anybody> i wonder if gak was the fastest meme to be created?
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe it is.
<Mr_Anybody> seriously it was just yesterday
<Mr_Anybody> .-.
<Phase4> 00,02not even 24 hours
<AJIsAwesome> ^

<Mr_Anybody> WHY WAS I FORCED TO HAVE EARS?!

<Maxwell_Cat> And you got up on the stage and danced
<Jeremias> WHERE ARE THEIR EYES?
<Gold_Demona> That sounds like Trixie's VA
<Mistress_RainBowDash> RD looks like shes a sleep
<ACS13123> Good morning Sweet Berry... I SAID GOOD MORNING YOU B- I mean...
<aniderp> derpy where are you?
<Jeremias> How do they BLINK
<Maxwell_Cat> DERP
<TheRandomkid321> Is it odd that seeing real life mangled corpses (from war) doesn't effect me at all? Even when their brain is showing? I should probably see someone about this.
<Jeremias> How do those costumes function?!
<Maxwell_Cat> CUZ THEY CAN
<aniderp> we say good morning >.>
<Invi> I wonder how much they get paid...
<Maxwell_Cat> MORNING
<Dj-Luna> they creepy
<Maxwell_Cat> IT IS MORNING
<Kencolt> Apparently the wearers manipulate both the mouth and the eyes. And yes, it's creepy as HELL.
<Tervicz> I wonder if someone could get Tara Strong to dress like that
<Mistress_RainBowDash> WB sumica
<Maxwell_Cat> CREEEEPEEEEEEER

<Gold_Demona> I'll give them this much, at least the mouths and eyes are moving on the costume.
<Jeremias> This is horrbile
<Mistress_RainBowDash> *claps*
<Kencolt> Someone had to choreograph this. That is a sad sad thing.
<Maxwell_Cat> Were...there two rds?
<Kandarihu> I swear. This gives me the scary idea of recreating this in Source Film Maker.
<Dj-Luna> i agree luna is best pony
<Jeremias> We aren't really watching this all, are we?
<ACS13123> Huh...
<Gold_Demona> I remember as a kid being disappointed that costume characters never moved their mouths when they spoke on stage shows.
<Rainbow> IM THE BEST PONY
<Maxwell_Cat> they kissed...
<alexxm> that is not rarity
<aniderp> doesnt look like rarity
<Maxwell_Cat> Bye rarity...

<Zawan> oh i return to THIS
<Invi> when the camer is too close, you can see, their eyes are derp
<Invi> *camera
<DaCakeofObst> there is no derp where there's poneh
<TheRandomkid321> THis is the only thing that's keeping me from crying. ON THE VERGE OF TEARS! And I need to go to bed. But if I'm not distracted constantly.
<Gold_Demona> Is she supposed to be Wind Whistler?
<Hisin> what in the flying fuck is this
<Invi> lol Hisin
<Rainbow> MLP G3 or sumfin'
<Invi> Dem Ladybugs are silly
<aniderp> he said pickle
<Invi> yay Pinkie Jazz
<aniderp> squink
<Gold_Demona> Squink
<DaCakeofObst> GAK
<Cypresswolf> and all the parents in the audience look bored to tears
<Hisin> GAK
<TheRandomkid321> Well I should probably leave instead of crying to you people more. You probably think i'm lying about being sad anyway.
<Rainbow> GAK?
<Hisin> Gak is back!
<DaCakeofObst> GAK everywhere
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Caramel DAT PUN!!
<Invi> what if a squink is a pinkie sense combo?
<DaCakeofObst> you can frrrt it!
<ACS13123> GAK!?
<aniderp> no
<aniderp> i dont want to
<Hisin> Looking at the parents forcing themselves to smile and pretend to enjoy this is amusing.
<Invi> Damn i lost the game
<DaCakeofObst> :D
<Mistress_RainBowDash> I HAVE DONE IT
<Hisin> Dammit you made me lost the game you ass
<aniderp> i lost the game
<DaCakeofObst> i just won the game
<Zack> :'( Poor costumes
<Cypresswolf> Im thinking about whiskey in a glass - I dont care if its 6 am
<Kandarihu> I'm not playing "The Game"
<Zack> :P Good actors
<Invi> Kandarihu, you are and you just lost it ^^
<Hisin> If you know what the game is at some point you're always playing it... for lif
<Snow> hi everyo- oh this again xD
<DaCakeofObst> positively pink!
<Hisin> that is the rules
<pony_2153> what the fuck am I watching
<Rainbow> G3 ponies
<Mistress_RainBowDash> DAT PLOT!!!
<alexxm> pony_2153 pony hell
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Sumica : indeed
<Invi> hay Lil_B
<DaCakeofObst> It's time for a PAAAAAARTEY
<Lil_B> hey Invi :)
<Mistress_RainBowDash> SPACE doesnot excites
<Mistress_RainBowDash> its 2 hours
<Snow> i may be a nolife, but on the app im level 49 now ^^"
<Lil_B> this is actually better than the G4 Life action Stage Performance they did somewhere once
<DaCakeofObst> one does simply not perform MLP live
<TheRandomkid321> I almosty forgot. Tell flyboy that I'm sorry if you see him on. I would appreciate someone doing so. But who would want to do something for me. Little old me who everyone ignores. Who everyone uses their tiny little brain to torment till they are on the verge of suicide. YES BTW A FEW DAYS AGO I PUT SCIZZORS IN A POWER SOCKET AND IF IT WASN'T FOR MY FRIEND I WOULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW!
<TheRandomkid321> Sorry sorry.
<Snow> Lil_B: talking about that is like talking about that one club
<Kencolt> pony_2153: It's called the "World's Biggest Tea Party", a live-action stage musical kigurumi extravaganza based on G3 for the most part.
<Lil_B> Snow which one club?
<Hisin> Does anyone ever feel bad for the people in the costumes at children's parties.
<Invi> no
<DaCakeofObst> nope, they are cool
<aniderp> they kissed
<Invi> they get paid for it
<Snow> Lil_B: the one that starts with a F
<Mistress_RainBowDash> aaaahh that Nuzzle
<Invi> why does she always whistle? does she have a obsessive-compilsion disorder?
<DaCakeofObst> unicormia?
<Kandarihu> Raising a child from her infancy changes a person. Those of us who have never been parents might not be able to understand.
<Hisin> No she is just the pony equivalent of a redneck
<Lil_B> Invi this Pegasus always Whisles in G3, because she's a Pagasus, and Birds and Stuff...
<Snow> sounds legit.
<Kencolt> Ithink her name is WindWHISTLER?
<Invi> Lil_B, so... it's a genetic obsessive-compilsive disorder :D
<aniderp> cookies
<Invi> dat poor bird...
<DaCakeofObst> come rainbow, let's make some cupcakes :O
<Mistress_RainBowDash> No coffie for pinkie
<Kandarihu> Well that pegasus wasn't whistling.
<Cypresswolf> I think Pinkie has way too much sugar as it is
<Hisin> I might get hate for this but fuck it.... Any pony stuff that isn't MLP has a 90% chance of sucking.
<Invi> dat song was pretty catchy
<DaCakeofObst> it's all mlp
<TheRandomkid321> I just need to go okay? Before I do something that will damage my reputation any more. ust remember tell Flyboy i'm sorry.
<Snow> its just isnt FiM
<DaCakeofObst> maybe not fim, but definetely mlp
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Hisin : a chance of GAKing
<Hisin> by mlp i mean the show
<Kandarihu> DaCakeofObst, Pony vs Pony isn't MLP
<DaCakeofObst> flyboy, some random guy is sorry
<Snow> i hope GAK can make it.
<Welsh_Pony> Pinkie asking rarity for streamers
<DaCakeofObst> GAK is BAK
<Cypresswolf> Hisin: well, now - but prior to G4 ponies were popular enough to still get renewed series
<Lil_B> well, the Trailer for the Nerd Movie looks Promising
<Eli> hey guys
<aniderp> it has been around for years
<Eli> aand what the hell is that?
<Invi> Lil_B, wreck it ralph?
<Cypresswolf> Hasn't the gak commercial been running since at least september?
<Lil_B> Invi nope Angry Video Game Movie
<Gold_Demona> I remember wanting gak when I was a kid.
<Mistress_RainBowDash> gak is Broken
<aniderp> but but but i dont know how -whistles-
<Lil_B> hey Eli !
<Invi> Lil_B, nice
<aniderp> :\
<Snow> dat pun spike
<Invi> the Ladybugs are Spike's bitches ^^
<Eli> hey Lil_B. haven't seen you at the premiere. where you there?
<Kandarihu> Maybe DaCakeofObst is watching the HUB all day and night long and had a nice long break from seeing Gak ads until now.
<Hisin> Well yes but because little girls enjoyed them little girls have no sense of good entertainment or bad but i don't blame them for that
<DaCakeofObst> spike gets all the bitches
<Cloudchaser> dat blood on my keyboard
<aniderp> nooo
<Snow> uhmmm
<Snow> i know this song? o.o
<Zack> Spike reminds me of dragon tails
<aniderp> not this song :<
<aniderp> IMA LITTLE TEAPOT
<aniderp> >..
<Hisin> I'm just saying that before FiM mlp was stuff only little girls and their mothers could enjoy
<Rainbow> MY EARS!
<aniderp> ow my head
<Lil_B> Eli hes, but stayd in 2 other rooms mostly with regulars, the Main Rooms are to crowded :/
<Invi> CO/ teapod
<Eli> and Sumica this pains me greatly... i really^2 hope bronies will never get to join in that
<Jeremias> How long left?
<DaCakeofObst> little girls enjoyed, their mothers had to :D:D
<Cloudchaser> tell me when its over please
<aniderp> after this im taking pain meds
<Invi> Cloudchaser, noh
<TheRandomkid321> Yep. No I'm defenatly leaning this time... Just forget I was ever on here tonight okay? Just forget everything I said.
<Eli> Lil_B: well we were on the special room for the regulars
<aniderp> -clings to cloudchaser-
<Lil_B> Eli which one?
<Snow> this reminds me, even thou its not related to g3, i still have a g1 video tape somewhere
<Eli> #bronystateregulars
<Kandarihu> Well I think that maybe parents were desensitized to their kids' stuff by parent-friendly stuff like Sesame Street.
<Snow> EVERYONE
<ACS13123> Invite ALL the ponies
<Snow> Swag.
<Rainbow> SHES GOT THE SWAG!
<DaCakeofObst> everyone is there... except spike :D
<Lil_B> Eli aww, that one xD I wanted to get in there too, but I forgot the correct name >.< I was in the spike chatroom
<aniderp> pony fun
<Kandarihu> But then again, I hear that Sesame Street was retooled based on a study about children's learning, and it's all about repetition now.
<Jeremias> This is even worse than Firendship is Magic live
<Dark_Horst> i just heard pony porn
<Dark_Horst> i feel bad
<Snow> its more enjoyable then that other one
<aniderp> when the episode comes on im in twilight sparkle room
<Mistress_RainBowDash> that boy was Caramel
<Mistress_RainBowDash> HEHE
<Kencolt> Jeremias: Consider the source material.
<DaCakeofObst> i wish the real show had that many songs
<Mistress_RainBowDash> hes loves him?
<aniderp> sunny daze
<Snow> i still want Caramel on my app!
<Kandarihu> Jeremias, this is better than the Live show of FiM. This has production values to it. the FiM live show is cheapsauce
<aniderp> is a filly in fim
<Lil_B> Dat Post Office
<Invi> bye everypony. keep Pink :D
<DaCakeofObst> i think there are more songs in this show than in complete S1
<Snow> :O lucky guy!
<Hisin> Sesame isn't much of a show as it is a reprogramming system to train little american chirldren to be the perfect workers. Supported by the fact its funded by the government
<Lil_B> bye Invi !
<Hisin> its a conspiracy i tell you
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Caramel i want to be your friend
<Snow> im busy building vynils and fluttershy's house atm
<aniderp> pokemon taught me words like paralysis
<aniderp> and paralyze
<Mistress_RainBowDash> hehe
<Rainbow> caramel?
<Snow> suddenly Caramel
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Caramel in stream
<Rainbow> DA WHY ARE YOU ON STREAM
<Kandarihu> Hisin, so an absense of Sesame Street would open the door to them growing up to become entrepreneurs?
<Sumica> 00,10you can add me on the pony app too
<Mistress_RainBowDash> he lost the grass seeds agian
<Snow> can you type it in chat?
<Lil_B> aniderp and Guillotine
<Rainbow> HES GONE!
<Sumica> 00,10Chace_sumica
<OppahHanSolo> ValtheJean
<aniderp> pony app?
<Snow> lvl 49 here :P
<Jeremias> Caramel flash
<Brights> What did i just walk into
<aniderp> whoa
<DaCakeofObst> positively pink fun!
<Lil_B> how good is the Pony app? is it that game we saw?
<Snow> im Lafka on the app
<aniderp> how they do that?
<Gold_Demona> The best... show... ever... @_@
<Zack> back legs are fake
<DaCakeofObst> O RLY?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<Hisin> This makes me realize how terrifying Fim would be if it was real.
<Zack> front legs are real
<Rainbow> That what I really looked like B4?
<Lil_B> hi Nittany_Discord
<Jeremias> Zack: NO WAY
<Hisin> is that berney?
<Hisin> barney*
<Snow> RAINBOWS DARLING
<aniderp> i need a new laptop then i can get bunch of things i cant on this
<Kandarihu> I wonder if it's coming out on PC. I don't have a smartphone and I don't want one.
<Jeremias> Total hype
<Rainbow> WHAT?
<Hisin> pretty sure that is barney's cousin or some shit
<aniderp> since it shuts off sometimes..
<DaCakeofObst> just get a simulator for android
<Zack> spike is about...15 years?
<Gold_Demona> I could see it being a facebook game
<aniderp> i have an ipod touch..
<Zack> pony times 7
<Kencolt> They have emulators for PC's to fake a phone?
<Brights> it looks like a facebook game from a screenshot i saw is it
<Gold_Demona> Cuz from what I've seen it plays like a lot of facebook games
<aniderp> pinky in thr air!
<Lil_B> I was thinking... I wanna make an OC called Guillotine
<Gold_Demona> I'd be okay with it if they made it a facebook game.
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, I'm avoid Facebook for about the same reason I'm avoiding smartphones.
<Brights> Facebook games are bad
<aniderp> royal sound
<aniderp> now its not
<Kencolt> Zack: THIS version of Spike is about.... 3450 years old, give or take +- 100. But he's taken a LOT of long naps.
<Lil_B> Kencolt at least to run several Apps and Games of phones
<Gold_Demona> I'm addicted to facebook games... o_o
<aniderp> i cant play fb game anymore i guess since this laptop :\
<Kencolt> And the kid tries to drink the card.
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona thats... bad :/
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Caramel do you still have that tea cup?
<Snow> Sumica: you sure its that name? i cant seem to find you.
<Brights> thats what they are made for but they are bad
<DaCakeofObst> china? in what region of equestria is this?
<Hisin> When my mom discovered the internet she got addicted to a facebook game called Petville and wasted nearly $200 on it.
<Snow> Caramel what level are you?
<Brights> I think the main reason i hate face book games is the energy system
<Snow> im lvl 49
<Zack> they said china
<Brights> the worst part is that stupid energy system
<DaCakeofObst> what is that app you all talk about?
<aniderp> pluto is a planet
<Zack> it is not canon anymore
<aniderp> we were taught it was a planet when we were kids so
<aniderp> it will be a planet forever
<DaCakeofObst> it's no planet
<aniderp> i know but
<Lil_B> look, at least 5 min since I saw the last Pony...
<Hisin> I hate "Free-to-Play" games that have stuff you can buy in-game because in the end its saps more money from you then a game that you pay for straight up.
<Hisin> which is why i hate mose facebook games
<Rainbow> Pluto?
<Snow> same here
<aniderp> they taught us it was a planet
<Snow> i need him for a quest
<Snow> im Lafka
<Snow> :D
<Brights> and then it was changed
<aniderp> yes
<Gold_Demona> That app sounds exactly like a typical facebook game. You get stuff for adding lots of friends (or nlock with actual money)
<aniderp> will be a planet in my mind
<Gold_Demona> unlock*
<Kandarihu> Hisin, I like Free to Play games. I don't have lots of money to spend anyway, so I learn to generally make do without.
<Snow> i need 90 gems for rarity D:
<Gold_Demona> The fun has been doubled!
<GAKMAN> Good lord what is this
<Hisin> My problem with that is with the "Free-to-Play" games you can barely do anything unless you pay
<aniderp> scootaloo why?
<Brights> Free to play the way DotA 2 and LoL do it is the best
<Hisin> they usually severely restrict you in till you buy their membership or whatever
<DaCakeofObst> there are some f2p which are not p2win, like LoL
<Snow> razzledazzle
<Kandarihu> Hisin, I have only played a few F2P games that are really like that. Those are the worst of the f2p.
<DaCakeofObst> the last time i checked, DotA2 was p2p
<GAKMAN> its free brah
<Brights> no its not
<Kencolt> GAKMAN: The World's Biggest Tea Party, a G3 based live action musical made specifically for kids. And to it's credit, the kids apparently LOVE it. Us, on the other hand...
<Kandarihu> Then again, the absolutely worst case of it was something that I spared myself the indignity of trying to play it.
<Brights> you could pay for a bate key but you dont need to
<pony_305> ;)
<RainbowRemiXx> WTf is this!!!!1111
<Tervicz> Ok, guys... Here's a thought of mine: Is Spike for Twilight Sparkle as Sam was for Frodo?
<Zack> When does it end
<aniderp> is it over?
<Zack> I dont like disco
<DaCakeofObst> it's 27,99 on steam
<RainbowRemiXx> o__o
<Gold_Demona> Would it earn me a lynching to say that I don't hate this?
<GAKMAN> Ah man Badass Spike
<kami> o_O
<Snow> rainbowdash is a mix here between rainbow dash and rarity
<Snow> in here*
<pony_305> hello I from Russia
<aniderp> disco dash
<Hisin> I thought spike was just severely friendzoned
<pony_305> :)
<Kandarihu> Some game that plays like Legend of Zelda, but it if you play it without paying into it, you're a ghost that is LITERALLY unable to physically interact with ANYTHING
<RainbowRemiXx> Disco Dash???
<RainbowRemiXx> wtf
<RainbowRemiXx> :D
<aniderp> why
<aniderp> ;_;
<Rainbow> IS THIS ABOUT ME?!?!?!

<Vordox> That moment
<Mistress_RainBowDash> BACON!!!
<Gold_Demona> Firefly is almost as good a flyer as Lunchpad
<Snow> XD
<Snow> Hello
<Vordox> Suddenly, pegassus
<Kencolt> This is the same time that created Transformers, about an invasion of robotic life-forms determined to experminate all organic life, and G.I. Joe, about a open war between a multinational elete military organisation and a rabid self-described terrorist group who's only agenda was world conquest. By those standards this is kind of mild.
<Vordox> And talking
<aniderp> firefly
<Rose`> meow
<Rose`> where you going?
<Kencolt> Same people, now that I think about it.
<Jmo> Hrm
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Mount that pony
<Vordox> <---- I think.. this is kidnapping?
<Rose`> firefly telling people to ride her
<Lil_B> and thusly Real Pony was forgotten forever and Megan was never seen again
<Dark_Horst> in case you dont know, firefly was actually spposed to be in FIM. but they didnt get the license, so they changed her color scheme and name
<Dark_Horst> guess into whom
<Lil_B> Vordox well... she was willing I guess
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Song INC
<Gold_Demona> Ah! So Sandy Duncan played Firefly :D
<Rose`> and they just leave that pony behind
<Snow> a friend of my roda a horse once without a saddle
<Vordox> What happened to the apolcalypze?
<Snow> rode*
<ACS13123> WE only have a month to live guys
<Rose`> LOLING
<Dark_Horst> in fact, the only pony in FIM which they have the license for is applejack
<Snow> he was talking high pitched all day
<ACS13123> Its nearly 21 December
<Dark_Horst> the others were supposed to be pre g4 characters too
<Lil_B> "laughing quite out loud" lqol
*Gold_Demona wanted to be Megan as a kid...
<Kencolt> Dark_Horst: They had a lot of the names still, but... well, there was stuff.
<DaCakeofObst> i can live without google if it really happens
<Vordox> So where you taking me?
<Gold_Demona> Sandy Duncan is best pony
<Vordox> TO MY WORLD
<DaCakeofObst> this was megan everypony, she was here to help us
<Kencolt> well, I've seen this a half dozen times in as many months-- I need to weed my WoW garden. ^_^ Laters.
<Brights> wow great first impression of their world
*Kencolt waves
<Gold_Demona> lol, Megan comes to help the ponies... Promptly gets captured. :D
<Snow> well

<pony_3981> she going to call from a mountain
<pony_3981> like to see them try
<Kandarihu> pony_3981, I'm guessing that the merger/acquisition talks that Hasbro is having with Disney is so that Hasbro can acquire rights to all elements of the G1 cartoons.

<Zamer> Got a Xyzzy game open password pony
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good afternoon everyone :)
<RainbowAsh> Obzezzed, I think I read something about MLP not being on telly in the UK, I could be wrong though.
<Zamer> Ponies aren't shown on tv outside NA
<RainbowAsh> Hi MLP_Brovakiin
<Snow> ooooh my... are you kidding me?
<Snow> i cant believe the internet...
<RainbowAsh> Zamer: Of course they are. Haven't you seen all the dubs?
<Obzezzed> Damn it! America always gets the best things :'(
<aniderp> not always
<Lil_B> Zamer we have them in Yourope, there are Official Versionsd in Asia and SAerica too
<Obzezzed> Pop Tarts, BronyCon, ComiCon, Think Geek
<Obzezzed> but mainly the Pop Tarts
<Zamer> yea it slipped my mind when i typed that
<Zamer> plus i got disctracted by the smell of bacon
<Obzezzed> XD
<aniderp> everywhere gets ramen right?
<aniderp> ramen is awesome
<Zamer> http://pyz.socialgamer.net/game.jsp Room for 6 Pass is pony
<Gold_Demona> aniderp, Do you mean REAL ramen, or the cheapo-deluxe kind?
<aniderp> uhh
<aniderp> any xD
<Obzezzed> Ramen?
<Gold_Demona> I wanna try real ramen someday. :3
<Gold_Demona> Ramen noodles
<Snow> Ramen Darling!
<Obzezzed> What is that?
<aniderp> the store stuff is a cup is the cheap?
<aniderp> really salty..
<Zamer> it's cup noodles
<aniderp> but its not bad
<Obzezzed> oh, Pot Noodles
<aniderp> but really salty
<Gold_Demona> aniderp, Pretty much any ramen you can buy in America. :P
<Gold_Demona> That's the cheap stuff
<Obzezzed> they have a bad reputation here XD
<aniderp> except them chinese places
<Zamer> i stopped eating them when i found out the chemical they use to preserve the noodles have a direct link to cancer
<aniderp> i wanna go back it was good food
<Gold_Demona> Isn't Ramen Japanese tho?
<[KOR]Leuk_Jin> well
<aniderp> chinese/japanese i think
<RainbowAsh> Does anyone know if the second episode of LPS is on youtube or anywhere?
<Obzezzed> the thing about noodles is that you need to get the exact right ones otherwise they taste so bad
<Gold_Demona> Zamer, Umm... If you listen to media at aqll, EVERYTHING has a link to cancer.
<Gold_Demona> Literally. Everything
<Gold_Demona> Everything causes cancer
<Alchemist> LPS?
<aniderp> so i could have brain cancer?
<aniderp> from my laptop?
<Zamer> lol Gold_Demona
<Lil_B> Zamer can you give me the name of the Ingridiance?
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, for of cancer causes cancer. ;)
<Gold_Demona> I remember at one point they said Coffee causes cancer
<aniderp> and headphones/earbuds
<RainbowAsh> fear
<Hisin> I got assburgers instead of cancer
<Gold_Demona> Friggin coffee
<Lil_B> does suizide cause cancer?
<Obzezzed> can someone explain this Gak meme please!
<Hisin> its not even a meme its some retarded shit we all say for no paticular reason
<Zamer> I forgot what's the wax is called let me see if i can find it
<RainbowAsh> Lil_B, depends on the method, but general rule of thumb is that the cancer doesn't get worse if you are successful
<Hrafn> Obzezzed: during the broadcast of Crystal Empire, there were a lot of commercials for this gooey stuff called gak
<Gold_Demona> Because of this, I don't believe anything that says "this stuff causes cancer".
<Obzezzed> I wonder if gak causes cancer
<Lil_B> RainbowAsh guess I found my new Hobby hopefully it's something I can get good in, to inspire people
<Snow> air is deadly, it only works so slow it needs at least 80 years to work
<Hisin> the sun causes cancer so be very afraid
<aniderp> drawing causes cancer? pft wont beleive that
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, because a favorite beverage of yours was once claimed to cause cancer you don't believe anything causes cancer anymore?
<Gold_Demona> You know, 100% of people who breathe air eventually die. >.>
<[KOR]Leuk_Jin> sun causes skin cancer > Celestia causes cancer
<Obzezzed> no, Ultraviolet light from the sun causes cancer
<Hrafn> breathing actually is bad, oxygen breaks down the cells over time :P
<Hisin> i think you're on to something gold
<Zamer> That's why I love Luna you can't get cancer from her
<[KOR]Leuk_Jin> same!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay.
<Gold_Demona> RainbowAsh, No, not just that. It's that they do this sort of thing with EVERY consumable product
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless you get moon cancer.
<Zamer> there is no such thing as moon cancer
<Obzezzed> o.O
<Obzezzed> :P
<Hisin> Oh by the way guys did you know immortality is possible there are immortal jellyfish and sea creatures we actually have no idea why people age
<aniderp> well the chat i mod is being good so..
<Hrafn> also, even without sunlight, you're usually exposed to low levels of space radiation
<aniderp> lets check the other one..
<Gold_Demona> They suddenly say "This causes cancer" and then some months later they turn around and say "this stuff's GOOD FOR YOU" and then they turn right back around and say "THIS STUFF WILL MAKE YOU FAT STOP CONSUMING IT!!!"
<Jmo> I question who brought this topic up.
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, well, it's a promising line of research for uncreative (and morally bankrupt) researchers: Just feed lots of some product to rats and see if they get sick more often than a control group.
<Snow> Hisin: we do not age, we are slowly being decomposed
<aniderp> all good
<Zamer> All we are doing is using physical bodies to interact with since we lost access to our spiritaul link to the universe
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: the reason they say that almost any food causes cancer is to avoid lawsuits (see the lawsuits won by the people who got cancer from smoking and they sue the tobacco companies for not making this risk clear).
<Hisin> well snow at least we know its possible to stop that decomposition
<Gold_Demona> RainbowAsh, Yeah, but they flipflop their results around so much, it's impossible to believe any of it.
<Snow> you really start to decompose after your 25th lifeyear
<Hisin> we just need to figure out how
<aniderp> is it possible that i can get taller?
<Zamer> damn Snow I don't want to be decomposed in 3 years
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist, People can win lawsuits for anything, so that doesn't really surprise me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Snow: Morbid.
<Zamer> it's because the legal system is a joke
<aniderp> im 5'0, a female and 20
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So I've been dying slowly for 4 years. Wish I would hurry up.
<Snow> Morbid? ._.
<ACE> HI!]\\
<Gold_Demona> SNow: That's depressing. I'm 28. :<
<aniderp> i bet im shortest one in the room
<Hisin> By the way MLP is deadly did you know 100% of bronies eventually die?
<Zamer> HAHA I WILL LIVE ON FOREVER 22
<Hisin> true satistics
<Zamer> Did you know water is bad for you
<Snow> but its true, your cells regenerate much slower after your 25th lifeyear
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, the results flipflop because interesting statistical blips, i.e. something like coffee causing cancer, that more scientists caffinate their rats in order to see if the result remains stable with larger experimental groups. It's a part of the scientific process and the end results should be rather trustworthy.
<Hrafn> I'm also 28, almost 29 :P
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: I know, I just say that of course food in general dont cause cancer, companies try to protect themselves by slamming this on every product.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wish I was 20 again.
<aniderp> my god..
<aniderp> next year i will be 21!
<Zamer> and plus you also got to factor in when both sets of research studies were created
<aniderp> legal drink age for america
<aniderp> >.>
<Snow> you know what we need?
<Zamer> Ponies
<aniderp> zelda?
<RainbowAsh> More ponies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Miss college. Miss learning.
<Snow> someone who omes back from the dead and says there is a heaven and hell
<Hisin> I'm 16 so by the time i'm middle aged they will probably figure this immortality stuff out, umad 20 year olds?
<Jmo> Oh god don't start that topic.
<Zamer> you mean Kakarot
<Gold_Demona> RainbowAsh, Ooooook, what exactly are you trying to explain? O_o
<Zamer> or Yusuke Yurameshi
<Zamer> or Ichigo Kurosaki
<aniderp> time machine
<Alchemist> Snow: there was a case like that recently.
<Snow> Ichigo?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Snow: People with near-life experiences claim seeing heaven and hell.
<Snow> i prefer Renji
<Gold_Demona> DOn't you mean near-death, Nittany?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: isnt it the same thing? :9
<Hisin> People who claim seeing heaven or hell were already religious to start with so there is a bias
<aniderp> one time when i was in elemntry school
<Zamer> actually Alchemist there have been several cases that have been reported
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, that early results are sometimes misleading, but if a claim has been thoroughly tested, it is a good idea to trust it, because in the end science works.
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist, No, because near-life means you're already dead. =/
<Snow> Nittany_Discord: those cenarios are mostly hallucinations
<aniderp> people said down there was mudslides and that xD
<Zamer> actually not true Hisin some weren't religious to begin with
<Hrafn> I had a near-life experience when my computer broke down and I couldn't get online
<aniderp> lol mudslides in hell
<Alchemist> Zamer: I know I just remeber a recent one where the subject was a well known neurologist
<Hisin> but most of them where zamer
<Gold_Demona> RainbowAsh, Yeah, but what I'm saying is they always let the results out too early before they have the final conclusive word on it.
<Hisin> most stories are from already religious peopkle
<Gold_Demona> So the media's word on it is always changing.
<Kandarihu> Alchemist, yeah. I dsedomething about that too
<aniderp> i dont like being in a church..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Scientist claim they are hallucinations caused by brain cells dying.
<Zamer> But the fact that some weren't proves that religion isn't a factor for it
<aniderp> in my head is like stay calm stay calm
<Alchemist> I like where this conversation is going :D
<Snow> i need living evidence before i believe in heaven/hell/reincarnation
<Hisin> when the majority is religoius it IS a factor
<[KOR]Leuk_Jin> Just give me more pony vidieos
<Zamer> yet then how would you explain the non-religious experiences then
<Alchemist> hallucinatins
<RainbowAsh> Zamer, the non-religous people are still aware of religion and have some semblance of popular ideas of the afterlife.
<Hisin> human senses aren't perfect and people don't always tell the truth them ost likely situation is that some people just say these stories for attention
<Snow> i say, when your dead your dead, done
<Alchemist> not that different like being on drugs. Doesnt mean the things one see while on drugs are truew
<Gold_Demona> you're
<RainbowAsh> Bring out you're dead
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> yore
<Gold_Demona> yor?
<aniderp> you know what is really sad?
<aniderp> fb drama :|
<Snow> but thats my opinion, it doesnt really matter :>
<Zamer> That's a good arguement RainbowAsh since religion has been around for almost the entire human history in some form or fashion, which was mostly used to control humanity by using fear
<Gold_Demona> YAR
<Hisin> Anyway i would believe your senses like sight and hearing aren't perfect when you're near-death...
<ShiningArmor> sup guys
*Gold_Demona puts on an eyepatch and hat.
<RainbowAsh> Zamer: True. On the other hand, oncontrolled humanity is usually anything but humane.
*Snow puts up a wooden leg
<Snow> on*
<Kandarihu> Zamer, you judge the people in the past too harshly
<aniderp> -puts up metal arm-
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kFhPVAhV_o
<Gold_Demona> YAR dead!
<Alchemist> I dont think the earlier tribes were that different.
<Snow> AVAST ME HARTIES
<Alchemist> We are quite controlled now and we kill each other just the same.
<Hisin> My stance on religion is that it was useful for maintaining laws and order in the past but that it is now unneccessary in the modern era
*Gold_Demona pokes the chat with a plastic scimitar.
<Snow> plastic eh?
<Snow> hold on
<Gold_Demona> Yup plastic
<Kandarihu> Hisin, I see the internet and I do not see order.
<Gold_Demona> I could also use a foam one, if you'd rather
*Snow pulls sword off the wall
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Bronysith
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hi aniki
*Gold_Demona pokes with a foam scimitar instead.
<Snow> here, tajke this steel one.
<Zamer> Actually Kandarihu It's not that I judge them too harshly, its that humanity at it's core has always been evil, religion was created to help control the masses which has been proven multitudes of time in human history, to keep those in said religion from knowing the truth
*Bronysith licks Gold_Demona
<Hisin> Order in the real word and order in a place where you do not need to face as much consequences for your actions are completely different monsters
<Gold_Demona> ohai Bronysith
*Snow gives Gold_Demona a steel sword
<Bronysith> all of this religion talk makes me want to bust Sumica s nuts
<Gold_Demona> :D
<Gold_Demona> Why?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't Bronysith.
<Vordox> inb4 Shizuschlafen pings after that link
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: right, ill go for his shins
<Gold_Demona> Why?
<Bronysith> you ever hafve abusted shin? doesnt feel good
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, but why?
<Gold_Demona> Why even do it?
<Gold_Demona> Why even think it?
<Alchemist> Zamer: it didnt make us less "evil" (btw what exactly is evil). People at their core are NOT evil. We are tribals. Always were. If we did things that benefits only us and not the tribe, the tribe would've outcast us/ got rid of us, just like now with prisons.
<Snow> ok SUBJEC CHANGER ACTIVATE
<Snow> whats everyone's fav anime?
<Gold_Demona> How about them ponies, huh? :D
<Bronysith> HEYKIDSWANNASEEADEADBODY?!
<Sylandest> morning, everypony :)
<Bronysith> oh you mean that shit premiere Gold_Demona ?
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Sylandest
<Starflash> Heya, Sylandest.
<Alchemist> okay, sorry, I'll stop
<Hisin> my favorine anime right now is "K"
<Jmo> Sylandest <3
<Hisin> yup just K
<Snow> K?
<Bronysith> i enjoyed NGE alot
<Bronysith> i dont know why
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith, Why you always gotta be so nasty about everything? :<
<Sylandest> howdy Gold_Demona, Starflash. Jmo, <3
<Hisin> check it out http://www.animefreak.tv/watch/k-online
<Dark92Enigma> My favorite anime starts with a K too
<Gold_Demona> My favorite aqnime is Lupin the Third
<Snow> lol
<Snow> mine too
<Gold_Demona> anime*
<Snow> mine is kuroshitsuji
<Snow> and wolfs rain is number 2 for me
<Hisin> My favorite anime of all time is mirai nikki that was beast
<Gold_Demona> I like Wolf's Rain, but the ending confused the crap out of me.
<Hisin> or future diary whatever you like to call it
<Kandarihu> Zamer, we really are basically evil. And there's no way that humans can ever be like that. But we are not a collective, we are individuals. We grow up and are influenced by the environment around us. And also the consequences of what we do.
<Snow> Gold_Demona: you want it explained?
<RainbowAsh> Bronysith, I liked it for all the pseudoscience and general forebedoing
<RainbowAsh> Bronysith, foreboding
<Gold_Demona> Snow: Sure.
<Hisin> What is evil? Is it harming fellow human beings competing and caring only for yourself? because that is how nature is
<alexxm> hey guys
<Hisin> its called survival of the fittest
<RainbowAsh> How are you alexxm?
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo alexxm
<RainbowAsh> Hisin: I think you might have misunderstood Darwin
<alexxm> i'm good RainbowAsh you?
<Hisin> i know what darwin meant
<alexxm> sup Gold_Demond
<alexxm> sup Gold_Demona
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, I am fine. ^^
<Snow> Gold_Demona: Kiba failed to get into paradise, so he died because the world was making a ice age. after that the world was reborn and new people lived on it.
<Alchemist> Hisin: its not. Pisons are full of people like that.
<Alchemist> *prisons
<Snow> Gold_Demona: it all started over.
<Hisin> We don't compete with every other human being but we compete against other groups
<Gold_Demona> Snow: That sucks. :<
<Hisin> groups outside of our groups
<Hisin> like other countries
<RainbowAsh> Snow, Gold_Demona: More to the point, Wolf Rain is showing one out of maybe many periods that are separated by ice ages.
<Snow> Gold_Demona: its like that profecy told, when wolfs return to the earth the end is near.
<Gold_Demona> But all the dudes we grew to love died for nothing. T^T
<Snow> thats why the ending is sad.
<Snow> D:
<RainbowAsh> Hisin: That's sociodarwinism, which has little to do with what Darwin actually was all about
<Gold_Demona> I like sad endings, but not meaningless ones. :C
<Snow> *checks facebook* *sees disturbing picture* FUUUUUU
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, wrong. In the next iteration there were these flowers everywhere, so there was progress.
<Gold_Demona> hm
<Hisin> Well maybe i made a bad connection you guys know about john locke and thomas hobbes john believed humans naturally work together thomas believes we naturally compete
<Hisin> i side with thomas obviously
<RainbowAsh> Hisin: Darwin was all about how species change and adapt through environmental pressure, i.e. evolution. Evolution can be explained why some species prefer to live in groups and other solitary, but he doesn't say either is better or mandatory.
<Snow> wasnt the subject animes? ._.
<Snow> XD
<Gold_Demona> I like turtles :>
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, think of the anime as only a short moment in a much larger story that plays out over many generations.
<Hisin> nah not really it was originally this
<Snow> Gold_Demona: if you like sad endings you should watch Kuroshitsuji
<Gold_Demona> RainbowAsh, My issue is that the ending of the characters we got to watch wasn't a satisfying one. =/
<Hisin> What i was trying to say is that i believe that humans and animals naturally compete and kill eachother to survive cynical i nkow but that dosen't make it any less valid
<Vordox> http://soundcloud.com/simgretina/dear-luna-acapella
<Vordox> <3
<Snow> Gold_Demona: http://www.watchanimeon.com/anime/kuroshitsuji/ this one
<Jmo> I'm curious Snow, do you watch anime in english or dutch subs?
<Hisin> BRB
<Snow> english subs
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, I think that might have been the point. It's a really well done tragedy.
<Jmo> Ah fair enough. Good stuff.
<Snow> there ARE no dutch subs
<Jmo> Huh, go figure.
<Jmo> Sorry to hear that.
<Snow> ywhy?
<Snow> yegnlish is better
<Jmo> T'was just curious, tis all.
<Snow> XD
<Zamer> DUB VS. SUB WARS BEGIN!!!
<aniderp> sub is better
<aniderp> SUB
<Jmo> Yeah yeah Snow >_>
<Gold_Demona> Depending on who does the dub, I like both dub and sub
<Snow> yJmo, i prefer japanese dub with english sub
<Gold_Demona> dem y's
<Jmo> She is doing it on purpose.
<alexxm> just saw the season 3 opener
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Snow> >_> <_<
<Zamer> Snow it's not Japanese dub if it was created in Japan
<Kencolt> Snow: Um... There are no Japanese dubs for Japanese shows-- that's the native tongue.
<Gold_Demona> I still haven't seen the premiere yet, so no spoilers!
<bronii> there are probably japanese dubs of japanese shows for the hearing impaired
<Gold_Demona> Zamer, It technically IS a dub since that's part of their animation process.
<Zamer> well Gold_Demona you better hurry because the 24hour lift will be over in 33minutes and 63minutes respectfully
<Snow> Kencolt: uhmmm, you know a better name for japanese spoken shows then?
<Gold_Demona> Zamer, huh?lift? lift of what?
<pony_9747> АХАХААХАХХ
<Zamer> the no talking about S3 first two episodes
<Kencolt> Snow: Yes-- back in the day when it all started, we called it Raw.
<Zamer> it's a 24 hr for bronystate
<Gold_Demona> ah
<Kencolt> As in Raw Japanese.
<Gold_Demona> Oh I'll watch it today, don't worry. Wanna wait until husband gets home though so we can watch it together
<Zamer> and no Dubbing is when you are using a different language outside the original
<Zamer> you're thinking of Raw
<Gold_Demona> Zamer, Nonono. I mean the technique they use.
<Kencolt> I've been involved in this forever. Or at least to you kids it might as well be forever.
<Gold_Demona> Zamer: They make the animation first and record the voices ontop of it. That's called dubbing
<Gold_Demona> Zamer, I think you're confusing the word "dub" with "translation/localization"
<Snow> if i may be honest, i sometimes find english dubs better then raw >_> <_<
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: Not in Japan. In Japan that's called Voice Acting.
<Gold_Demona> You're not getting what I mean. ><
<Gold_Demona> I don't mean the acting
<Gold_Demona> I mean the process of putting the sound to the video. In other places they record the voices first and then animate to it.
<Vordox> >.>
<Vordox> <.<
<Gold_Demona> In Japan they dub it.
<Kencolt> Snow: I agree with that. Some dubs have been amazing-- and get certain jokes off far better than the original-- at least in cultural terms. And the Slayer dubs are known for epic gags.
<Zamer> Gold thats not dubbing
<Gold_Demona> That's literally what the process is called.
<Snow> ermagerd
<Snow> so many pony tumbler jokes are about GAK now
<Snow> :D
<Zamer> I give it until Next Week's Episode
<Zamer> to see if Gak lasts another week
<Snow> i tell you
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: Not in Japan it's not. It's called Voice Acting. Japan is famous for "Who the heck cares about lip-synch?" It's only a concern on other cultures, really.
<Snow> GAK is the smooze in disguise
<RainbowAsh> Zamer, if the gak commercials return we might be in for a gooey season
<Zamer> i lost count on how many times the gak commercials were on the air yesterday
<Gold_Demona> Oh nevermind...
<Snow> RainbowAsh: that pun...
<Snow> EVERYONE, GAK IS THE SMOOZE! :O
<Kencolt> And any more Gak jokes and I'll start floaming at the mouth.
<Zamer> Calling S3 Finale Smooze Returns with twice as many Gak commercials
<RainbowAsh> Zamer: The finale will be the intro followed by fiftyeight minutes of gak
<Gold_Demona> Nobody's getting what I mean, so I'm just gonna drop it. >=/
<Zack> Thankyou discord
<Zack> When will it be up again?
<Jmo> O U Dema.
<Snow> sudden silence
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup
<fluttershyftw17> is anyone else not getting stream?
<Gold_Demona> There is no stream
<Snow> i still have that creepy snips on my streambox
<fluttershyftw17> ok good
<Zamer> I ate the streamer
<Snow> i ate Zamer
<Gold_Demona> Also Snow, Gak is only Smooze if it's purple. :P
*Gold_Demona wants purple gak now
<Snow> it exsists
<Zamer> there is purple gak
<Gold_Demona> I know, and I wants it

<Gold_Demona> I remember wanting gak when I was a kid
<Zamer> these kids today don't know the wonders of our childhood
<Zamer> but they do get to live through the tortures of Furby
<Zamer> at about 6x the cost
<Hypercynder> hello
<aniderp> furby...

<aniderp> but its expensive
<aniderp> the new furby
<Zamer> Furby the toy Everyone wanted then after 10minutes you realized it was the worst mistake of your life

<Zamer> blame Hub for playing it after every other commercial the otherday
<Tailsy> GAKA GAKA

<aniderp> they are named
<Zamer> i lost count after 2 hours
<Zamer> you mean 2016 Tailsy
<thelonepony> Zamer: true
<Kencolt> Zamer: What normallyhappens is local cable providers oberlay at least a few of those commercials with local ads-- as is normally intended. What we saw was raw HUB cast, so no breaks.
<Tailsy> Zamer: oh. iwouldn't know beacuse i'm not american
<thelonepony> and i had a Huge Headache from that comotion /)_-
<artist> guys, what's gak?
<Zamer> no Kencolt we had breaks and i mean during the commercials on the station not in the chat

<thelonepony> no u
<Zamer> i wish i could find a free Ruby glitch in the app so i could buy Celestia
<thelonepony> :3 jk
<Kencolt> Basically, it's snot to play with. That's pretty much how it was marketed in it's original incarnation. Also, it can fart. That was a major selling point back in the day. Seriously.
<CrimsonPhoenix> What if Zelda was a gril http://www.geekosystem.com/dad-rewrites-zelda-for-daughter/

<aniderp> caught it and was shaking
<Zamer> inb4explosion
<Stormy> it was like 65F yesterday, really rare in the middle of fall
<aniderp> saved bunch of times after
<spyrofan001> i bet
<Zamer> Funny Fact was Zubats and Ratata was always in B1
<Kimori> What idea did you have?
<Stormy> Ever thought of just making a fan game, spyrofan001?
<Kimori> and hi Stormy :]
<Zamer> Just the Main Character was too dumb to enter the sewers
<Stormy> Hey Kimori
<aniderp> its a boy
<aniderp> i may sr a few times
<Zamer> kill it for a horrible IV'd ♀
<Zamer> strange the alt code worked that time
<spyrofan001> its about spyro and his mate you chose out of cynder or ember and you get to play as there kids and them and ignitus tells spyro hes his father and i will use some of my OC's as chracters
<Snow> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my6yGp-oGf8&feature=related such an epic cover

<pony_702> anypony ever figure out that theres a setting on youtube that you can speed up and slow down videos
<aniderp> omg..

<Kimori> They wont because Skylanders is their main focus

<Dark92Enigma> I just found out something........is it possible that Crystal Empire ripped off the plot to the Dark Crystal? (1982)
<Stormy> I think I spelled it wrong
<Kimori> :D
<Kimori> speaking of Blako..
<Gekoncze> hi all
*Dark92Enigma YouTube comment*
<Hypercynder> no
<Stormy> But yeah, you wouldn't have to make the game yourself
<Kimori> hi Gekoncze
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, Dark Crystal?
<Stormy> Just get a few programmers who like your idea and would be willing to help you
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: 1982 movie
<Dark92Enigma> hold on
<Gakmakster> gaK gaK gaK
<spyrofan001> i wrote a story called the truth and posted it on FF.net Im spyrofan001 on there also
<RainbowRemiXx> god dammid .__.
<Gekoncze> i sense "make" and "game "word here
<thelonepony> >:I
<Hypercynder> yes
<aniderp> lax ..
<Zamer> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal dat plot
<Stormy> Gekoncze: We're talking about spyrofan001's game idea
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: we've SEEN THIS MOVIE HERE

<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: remember those muppets a la NeverEnding Story?
<Gekoncze> oh

<Rainboom> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BdXzuJbh_8 MLP FiM in this Chevy commercial
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, you're implying that I'm always paying attention to Brony Movie Night
<Gekoncze> btw Blako was my previous username
*Dark92Enigma On another planet in the distant past, a Gelfling embarks on a quest to find the missing shard of a magical crystal, and so restore order to his world.
<Hypercynder> hypercynder
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: :$ not neccesarily......
<Dark92Enigma> sorry
<Dark92Enigma> just my good memory
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352620861387.png
<spyrofan001> its about spyro and his mate (U chose from Cynder or Ember) and u create there kids and play as them through there life and ignitus admits hes spyros father
<Dark92Enigma> anypony remember that film?
<Gakmakster> >_>;)
<Gekoncze> interesting idea
*Dark92Enigma oh, great.....was the movie so forgettable for you that this GAK commercial stole the camera? :|
<spyrofan001> check out my story and leave a raview with whatever you think heres the link'
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/vMV15.png http://i.imgur.com/hCexY.jpg Say what you will about the premiere of season 3 but may thunder strike me if it didn't have adorable shots.
<Dark92Enigma> it was a great movie
<artist> what does gak have to do with mlp?

<artist> no
<thelonepony> Hi StinkomanFan :)
<Dark92Enigma> i know Doug Walker doesn't do the NC anymore, but i wonder what does he think of the GAK on his facebook
<artist> CrimsonPhoenix: i watch them on youtube :P
<aniderp> naughty nature
<aniderp> i like
<aniderp> good stats
<StinkomanFan> Ohey, we got a new guy?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai StinkomanFan :)
<Gekoncze> I can't see the link
<aniderp> i was here since yesterday
<Zamer> artist they played the Gak Commercial which is a product from Nickolodeon about every other commercial while showing 2 commercials for Gak back 2 back each time
<CrimsonPhoenix> StinkomanFan, pretty sure we have plenty of new guys
<Zamer> for the entire day
<aniderp> girl*
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zamer, 4 commercials
<CrimsonPhoenix> back to back
<artist> Zamer: gak
<Hypercynder> :)
<alexxm> so what did you guys think of the season opener
<aniderp> not this again
<artist> gak gak gak
<thelonepony> >:I
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gak, Gak glow in the dark, gak priner, gak
<Zamer> they only did all 4 commercials once
<Zamer> every other time it's been two commercials at once
<CrimsonPhoenix> alexxm, I thought it was fine and Somrero has caught my interest
<aniderp> time for genescent
<StinkomanFan> "HASBROS BEST THING EVER"
<spyrofan001> ya
<spyrofan001> i was randomly lessioning to music one day and it popped into my head
<spyrofan001> heres the link to my ff.net
<spyrofan001> http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7862276/1/The-Truth
<spyrofan001> sorry my internet went out for a min
<spyrofan001> leave a review of whatever you think
<spyrofan001> i also started a roleplay forum on FF.net called The legend of Sj and friends roleplay
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: THAT's another point in the season's premiere favor. We've got more newbies in Bronystate
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gak was around when I was a kid.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fun stuff. It's also an effective dirt magnet.
<Dark92Enigma> Nittany_Discord: REALLY?
<Zamer> Sombro was mainly used for his backstory tyranny and then used to reenact the fear for the Crystal Ponies to make sure they didn't revive the Crystal Heart
<spyrofan001> its about spyro and cynders frist son (my OC Sj(Spyro.jr))
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<aniderp> k im good now
<Dark92Enigma> why it wasn't a meme BACK THEN and not RIGHT NOW!???? :|
<Zamer> less internet involvement
<Kencolt> Dark92Enigma: Because Ponies.
<artist> gakgakedy gak gak gak
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The internet barely existed back then.
<StinkomanFan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgQ60DoNRJs
<Zamer> back then it was still used for porn
<Zamer> now it's used for ponies
<Dark92Enigma> Nittany_Discord: true.....but when was it made?
<Zamer> back in the 60s
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0190's.
<Zamer> oh Gak or the Internet?
<Dark92Enigma> Zamer: yes....there was SOME backstory for King Sombra, but little screentime
<Dark92Enigma> besides, how did Shining Armor got infected?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Daniel Ingram and Meghan McCarthy Interviewed
<Dark92Enigma> we've NEVER SEEN HOW
*Dark92Enigma EXPLAIN MOVIE!
*Dark92Enigma EXPLAIN!!!!!!!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think the episode should have had more time to explain that.
<Zamer> he didn't really get infected, Sombra used some glowly stuff that nullified Shining Armor's magic
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01S2's opener suffered from being a bit short.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Despite being two episodes.
<Zamer> but he and eeveryone else was healed at the end
<BlackRose> what are we talking about...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, http://youtu.be/j4j02VTiFQE?t=9m16s
<artist> GAK, GET IT NOW!
<aniderp> remember when season 2 came out?
<Stormy> I wonder why so many new people have been finding this forum in the past few days
<Zamer> and Dark92Enigma it's to much adult content to have been aired
<spyrofan001> are u talking about my forum?
<aniderp> season 2 came out on my 19th birthday
*Ponies47 explodes
<Stormy> No, spyroforum
<aniderp> september 17th..
<aniderp> was awesome :D
<Gakmakster> ive been waiting for an hour for this to load, what am i forgeting, am i forgeting anything?!
<Stormy> lots of new people joining
<Rainboom> My friends Bday is on Brony Appreciation Day im jealous :c
<spyrofan001> Wow
<Ponies47> Rainboom, :c
<Stormy> I just approved a request to join the fan art group
<spyrofan001> i found it when i was looking for spyro stuf
<Ponies47> My birthday is in December X_X
*Rainboom is drinking a lot of flat soda and it spilled on me 2 times so far
<thelonepony> my birthday is tomorrow :3
<aniderp> sr for genesect time
<Dark92Enigma> Nittany_Discord: yes, but Discord had enough screentime. and he had an epic voice.......then again, looking back, the S2 finale set the bar sky-high, so it's hard to top off
<Rainboom> thelonepony: :O!
<thelonepony> :3
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: thanks :)
<Rainboom> SOMEPONY ORDER THE BASS AND PARTY CANNON FOR TOMORROW!
*Rainboom calls DerpyMail
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01S2 finale did set the bar high.
<Gekoncze> there are still a lot of Spyro fans on the internet. I was surprised how many spyro fans I found on mlpforums
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And S3 hasn't reached it yet.
<Ponies47> Ohai Nittany_Discord
<spyrofan001> look up chibi spyro its cute
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Ponies47.
<StinkomanFan> There should have been less songs and more explinations.
<Dark92Enigma> Zamer: adult content? you mean the movie, or the s3 premiere?......
<Zamer> can we all agreed that the best part of the 2-parter was Twilight running on stairs
<spyrofan001> ive been a spyro fan sence i was born
*Rainboom "Hello?" "I would like to take an order for the Party Cannon and the Bass Cannon please?" "Alright that will be 400 bits" "Ok bye!"
<Kimori> Are you serious?
<Gekoncze> really?
<Dark92Enigma> Zamer: OH WAIT
<Zamer> and Dark92Enigma S3 Premier with Shining Armor vs Sombra
<Kimori> Gekoncze thats funny, btw why are you on the mlp forum?
<artist> s3 wasnt as great as i thought it would be tbh
<Zamer> let's just say not for the young at heart
<StinkomanFan> The S3 premeir had a cut scene of Spike and Rarity in bed.
<AzureIllusion> Twilight can now control gravity, she's way overpowered now.
<Dark92Enigma> Zamer: YEAH, i don't wanna know how Shining Armor got infected (sorry for realizing it too late) :D
<Zamer> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/nWLF8.jpg
<Gekoncze> I like the show
<aniderp> be good stats genesect
<Verspa> Is anyone buffering?
<Zamer> SR gene fTW
<Zamer> sadly we couldn't do that for the Therian formed Kamitro
<Rainboom> I didn't like King Sombra he was BORING and his design was a little cheesy I mean he didnt even give a reason why he took over its just the character only to make the plot
<thelonepony> No stream atm
*Dark92Enigma Hello, welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger, can i take your order?
<aniderp> getting worse sorta
<Stormy> Did you watch the new episodes yesterday?
<Gekoncze> and I like improving my communication skills
<Zamer> Yes I would like a Good Burger with nothing on it
<Dark92Enigma> Rainboom: granted he looked like a Sailor Moon Villain reject
<ShadowQuill> My goodness... SLAVES...
<spyrofan001> ive always loved spyro
<Gekoncze> not yet, I watch only few episodes a month, now I am in the middle of session 2
<ShadowQuill>
<Rainboom> I guess all he wanted was slaves and/or the Crystal Heart? :/
<Stormy> Ah
*Dark92Enigma NC: (in response to Edward) no, but you can take this [middle finger] AND SHOVE IT UP HARD
<Zamer> What if Sombra only wanted the Crystal Heart because he lacked one
<Stormy> I won't spoil anything then :P
*Dark92Enigma Good Burger review reference*
<Gekoncze> ok
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rainboom, he's a dictator
<spyrofan001> im trying to draw spyro but i keep messing up XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's generic but all he wanted was an empire to rule over
<CrimsonPhoenix> and have power
<aniderp> bad bad bad
<Gekoncze> I remember myself trying to draw spyro, but it was always ugly
<Zamer> CrimsonPhoenix we only heard one side of the story and we all know how tabloids are
<Stormy> I'm always drawing little dragons on stuff
<Stormy> But I'm still not any good at it
<Rainboom> Discord and Chrysalis are my two favorite reasons (I have a reason for Discord but for Chrysalis shes just plain awesome xD)
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: i wanted him to say he wants to rule the empire and then EQUESTRIA so i can say OF COURSE!
<Rainboom> villians*
<Octavia6666> hi
<aniderp> come on gensect be good >.>
<thelonepony> Hi Octavia6666 :)
<Zamer> also Celestia and Twilight using "Dark" Magic
<spyrofan001> same here
<Zamer> I call shenanigans
<Dazerio> Meow
<Octavia6666> :P
<thelonepony> aniderp: inb4 bad stats
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zamer, magic powered by hatred
<Stormy> I'm terrible at depth; everything just starts to look weird when I try to draw anything but a side view
<aniderp> i keep finding bad stats
<Rainboom> Zamer: Yeah and in the end of the episode Luna was carrying this dark thing it was probably a book for her kind of magic for Twilight
<spyrofan001> im terrible at tailblade and wings
<Stormy> Wings are really hard. >.>
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rainboom, in my opinion that book pretty much hinted Starswirls the bearded
<killerpony7733> I'm still interested in a rumor that was confirmed by the creators. Cause if they seriously mean't it theres gonna be a huge damn shit storm when the ball drops
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/148742
<spyrofan001> Who likes my game idea?
<spyrofan001> and ya
<Dark92Enigma> Then again, King Sombra turned out to be the SAURON of the series: we barely know anything about him, we want more development for him, so we make our own plot for him
<Stormy> I'm sure there's probably some good tutorials on deviantart
<Dark92Enigma> LOTR reference FTW*
<Zamer> I'm still going by my inplausible theory that Twilight becomes Starswirled the Bearded and gets locked in the past
<Kimori> I like the idea, would be nice to see Spyro and Cynder again
<spyrofan001> anyone have a facebook or twitter?
<Kimori> But keep in mind there were a lot of fans that hated the LOS series
<Kimori> which is a shame :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, and Sauron was kinda cool
<Zamer> what rumor killerpony7763
<Stormy> Me being one of them. Sorry :(
<killerpony7733> Zamer Not sure if i can bring it out
<Kimori> no hard feelings stormy :]
<Zamer> message it to me then
<spyrofan001> Thats why i made it so u can chose from cynder or ember
<Stormy> I mean I didn't _hate_ it... but I didn't really like it either
<Yahooz> ah, finally
<Zamer> i probably heard it but forgot
<Gekoncze> I think it is good idea, but I would need to have more info to say it on 100%
<Yahooz> its died down to a reasonable amount
<spyrofan001> im trying to get help with it
<Rainboom> The only things I wanna know right now is Star Swirl the Bearded's history and why he's so imporant and what did Celestia mean when she told Twilight that she will be 'moving on to her next level of her studies"
<spyrofan001> anyone have a twitter?
<Gekoncze> only FB
<Stormy> Nope
<aniderp> im gonna scream if these are bad stats
<naturesfury> idea* what if twilight is starswirls ancestor
<spyrofan001> I have both
<Stormy> I kind of have an irrational dislike for twitter
<Rainboom> DUN DUN DUUUUUNN
*aniderp rages
<Stormy> I have facebook though....
<Gold_Demona> naturesfury, ancestor?
<spyrofan001> i kinda like twitter but i rarly get on it
<Dark92Enigma> Rainboom: maybe......future plot for season finale? :O

<Zamer> I'm still calling she gets trapped in the past and becomes the Starswirled the Bearded of Legend
<Rainboom> Or maybe Celestia
<Rainboom> 's grandfathers

<aniderp> ewwww
<thelonepony> what?
<aniderp> throw out
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai DaringDerpy :)
<Lunac> Dark92Enigma no-one knows. what we;ve been told of series 3 realy des sound like they've made the hollywood sequel mistake of aking what waspopular and making it more so wihout reason.
<[SWAG]Haku> I picked Revenge of the Nerds some months ago, it won, everyone loved it. Everyone who saw it agrees it was the best B film shown yet
<DaringDerpy> oh, this one
<Lunac> Can there be such a thing as a good -movie?
<Lunac> B-movie
<Jmo> Domooo~
<Domo> Jmo: -poke- ouo
<Zamer> Shizuka(?) or Saturn said we redeemed ourselves this week with the best Pixar and Best Gore movie
<Lil_B> well, my new house has no Telephone or Internet access until 1st of Dec
<Jmo> How're thou?
<DaringDerpy> every b-movie should be good. but bad people always choose poor movies
<Bronysith> im voting for either clerks 2 or jay and silent bob strike back
<Domo> Jmo: Good and you?
<[SWAG]Haku> Lunac Again, Revenge of the Nerds
<Jmo> I am good.
<Domo> thats good ouo~
<MaxTheBrony> Im off playing some Ac3 be back later ^^
<Lil_B> now my PC has to stay at my old room, I guess home is not always where 127.0.0.1 is
<Jmo> Indeed.
<Lunac> I mean the B-movie classification not the B-movie choices.
<alexxm> Bronysith my b movie choice is the castle of caglistro
<aniderp> im ok now.. i had an oreo
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<thelonepony> Hi RaveBrony :)
<[SWAG]Haku> Lunac Oh... wel of course. Whats good is all about preference. B film are simply films with low budget, so by the that logic, great films of old can be B film; like some of the old Dracula films, Creature of the lack lagoon, The Giant Claw
<Domo> Hi RaveBrony ~
<[SWAG]Haku> etc etc

<Lil_B> the Gak meme is too stupid in too many ways... I was there yesterday, put I guess the Chatroom I was In was smart enough to ignore it
<Yahooz> People hate on Gak because its the one thing that doesnt have to do with ponies
<Gakmakster> i think gaK is funny, though i only learned about this meme yesterday, god i hope it doesnt become as popular as the famous saying, "trololololololol"
<Yahooz> ./)_-
<Gakmakster> Yahooz: nice
<Lil_B> Gakmakster it only started yesterday

<DaringDerpy> /mlp/ was full of gak. reddit created a /r/gak subreddit with dozens of threads in less than 30 minutes
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352652730991.gif
<Dark92Enigma> Yahooz: that double facehoof....:D
<Lil_B> DaringDerpy and My little Brony on memebase got flooded with Gak
<Dark92Enigma> Yahooz: reminds me of Spongebob
<Gakmakster> Lil_B: thats what i thought, epecially since a gaK commercial went on twice in a row

<CrimsonPhoenix> http://askmlcblobs.tumblr.com/post/35489199250/original-characteeer-donut-steal-1
<Dark92Enigma> So GAK got to be a meme.......but FRYING THE COKE isn't????
<Lunac> I havre to admit I probably enjoyed watching chrysalis beating Celestian to the floor a little too much.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and then the chubbies made Sombra better
<Chrysalis> Lunac ikr
<Lunac> Also tempted to dub highlander over it.
<Dark92Enigma> Yahooz: ok, i'll leave you alone :$
<Lunac> Chrysalis :)
<aniderp> omg
<pony_2043> лпоп
<aniderp> -salutes to chrysalis-
<Yahooz> ENGLISH MOTHAFUCKA
<thelonepony> ^
<Yahooz> DO YOU SPEAK IT?
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma to be honest, back when this Review cam,e out, I thought to myself , that this somehow doesn't sound right to me
<pony_2043> Idiot...
<aniderp> i thought someone was chrysalis here so.. i kept with this name
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chrysalis, is best queen
<Lunac> The only queen in MLP
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lunac, shhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Lunac> What?
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: what review, again?
<CrimsonPhoenix> she doesn't know that
<Lunac> i think she does
<Lunac> it is kind of obvious
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: sorry, i'm usually forgetful about some things, but not in others
<Dark92Enigma> :$
<Cypresswolf> :) meetup's over so next week, I'll be here in chat - there are other episode meetups around Houston, but I dont know where yet or when for that matter
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma I'm thinking about which one it was >.< it was toigether with Lupa >.<
<Lunac> I also like the fact they are keeping Luna;s appearnce to a minimum it limits the chances they will ruin the character.
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: SIMON SEZ

<Gakmakster> will someone make a meme out of this, omlp, instead of omg (oh my god), you say omlp (oh my little pony). or just give feedback on it
<Jmo> dabi bot is worst bot.
<Lunac> pince-dari why the double post?
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352641853430.png
<Lil_B> the reason Chrysalis is the only Queen in Equestria is because of the writing and advertising :) "Princess" is for good and nice Characters, and "Queen" mostly gets used for evil characters
<CountDoofus> The "We don't talk about S3E1+2 yet" still in effect?
<prince-dari> Lunac: Two different posts were made
<TROctavia> or osc for oh sweet celestia
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B the reason you mixed both reviews is because Dennis Rodman is in both movies
<Lunac> Lil_B Are you suggesting Celestia is NICE?
<Yahooz> ...so much to learn
<Yahooz> ...so much leeeeeeearn
<Lil_B> Lunac well, they wanna advertise her as nice to the Kids
<Lunac> Celestia is a troll, lazy, and constantly keeps her sister down.
<Dark92Enigma> and thank you Lunac! :)
<Gakmakster> Celestia is nice.... to an extent. theres always the dark part of youtube... (princess mol-estia)
*Dark92Enigma hugs Lunac
<Lunac> she is as crazy and corrupt as she should be after a full reich, (1,00 years).
<Yahooz> hey guys,
<Lil_B> Oo when wqas the last time she kept Luna down? xD
<Yahooz> want to be enlightened?
<Lunac> Aww thanks Dark92Engima *hugs back8
<Lil_B> Lunac you don't know what "reich" means right?
<TROctavia> lol, reich.
<Lunac> Lil_b modern defintion 1,00 year reich, nazi germany
<Lunac> yeah I wen there
<TROctavia> which was the Third Reich
<Lil_B> Lunac nope, Raich is simply the german word for "Empirere" ... litrteraly 1:1 Translation
<Gakmakster> yesterday morning, i woke up to my alarm clock, which i forgot to turn off for the weekend, and i couldn't sleep, i was too excited

<RaveBrony> Invi: Hahaha, i wouldnt doubt it :D
<Rex_Mundi> About time we saw enslaved ponies though, that happened all the time in G1. Ever hear about how the Gewle eyed ponies in G1 got those eyes?
<Invi> Rex_Mundi, wat?
<TROctavia> Gewle eyeed ponies?
<FlutterMEDIC> hey guys
<Invi> hay FlutterMEDIC
<TROctavia> hello
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
<thelonepony> Hi FlutterMEDIC :3
<aniderp1> hi
*thelonepony hugs FlutterMEDIC :3
<FlutterMEDIC> anything going on?
<Rex_Mundi> In G1, there are a few ponioes with red gems for eyes, and in a comic book you learn that they have those eyes because they were slaves working underground and their eyes died, so they replaced them with magic gems that allow them to see again when they got free.
<aniderp1> nope
<thelonepony> Nothing much
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> The episode felt like a 1980s G1
<FlutterMEDIC> what episode?
<Invi> Rex_Mundi, wow hmm
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> yesterday a lot happened
<Lil_B> I liked the Greek Design of the Crystal Empire
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> me too
<TROctavia> Is it me, or..
<FlutterMEDIC> lost here, need information
<Dark_Horst> ...just in case you've been wondering if there'S an image about spike raping king sombra, there is. if anyone needs me, i'll be bashing my head into a wall ofer there
<TROctavia> did that empire seem extremely small?
<FlutterMEDIC> Dark_Horst: welp, that killed the mood
<Rex_Mundi> TROctavia: My guess is that every settlement other than the capital was destroyed.
<Dark_Horst> ther was a mood?
<TROctavia> That would make sense
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352655275980.jpg
<aniderp1> ok..
<aniderp1> im gonna try to watch old mlp//
<FlutterMEDIC> CrimsonPhoenix: nice
<DoctoDoctorWho> I guess you could say the economy, "went under.
<FlutterMEDIC> aniderp1: isnt as bad as you think
<Socks> CrimsonPhoenix: :D
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Maybe the empire was bigger back then
<aniderp1> i took pain meds earlier
<Lil_B> and did anyone noticed that the white parts in the pupils of these Ponies weren't rounded like normal, they had corners that made them looked like they were shaped like Rupees or other kinds of Gemstones
<aniderp1> i get sick when i watch the old
<TROctavia> Also, the castle looked like it was rather useless other than a few rooms
<aniderp1> trolloa roola
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait
<aniderp1> umm
<CrimsonPhoenix> why am I Crimson
<FlutterMEDIC> Lil_B: well, they are CRYSTAL ponies
<CrystalPhoenix> there we go
<TROctavia> Lil_B, yeah they had hexagonal thingies
<FlutterMEDIC> nice
<DoctoDoctorWho> Come on that was funny
<Lil_B> FlutterMEDIC yes, and I think thats a nice touch :)
<aniderp1> before that..
<aniderp1> pony gangnam style
<Lil_B> TROctavia glad someone else noticed :)
<CrystalPhoenix> Lil_B, I noticed it from the DVD cover that was up for pre-order a while ago
<FlutterMEDIC> btw guys, sometime today i'm leaving for Calgary, Canada to attend a funeral, so wish me well
<CrystalPhoenix> http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dl3R3XEdL._AA1500_.jpg
<aniderp1> what
<Lil_B> CrystalPhoenix haven't seen it :/ I tried to stay away from all the spoilers xD
<aniderp1> is my only reaction
<Lil_B> We wish you well FlutterMEDIC
<FlutterMEDIC> CrystalPhoenix: dat RD hair
<CrystalPhoenix> and seriously one would need to be blind for not noticing it
<CrystalPhoenix> FlutterMEDIC, Rainbow Ventura
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I like her main
<Jmo> ERMAGERD DAT MAIN.
<FlutterMEDIC> i think Twilight's suits her though
<TROctavia> Why.. are there only four with the hex eyes?
<Lil_B> and the City Layout was kinda like Twilight Sparkles Cute-Mark :3
<CrystalPhoenix> TROctavia, good question
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> she is hexed, hexed
<Lil_B> ... ssometimes I wonder if I follow the background too much.,..
<CrystalPhoenix> maybe a fault in design
<DoctoDoctorWho> And you all said cadence wasnt a real alicorn, hah.
<aniderp1> trying to find it..
<aniderp1> the old one
<TROctavia> maybe they just forgot halfway through making it
<aniderp1> runaway rainbow episode?
<aniderp1> crystal princess?
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> notice the stadion http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_9V4-6UAOzU/UCacR1O_qlI/AAAAAAAA0DM/Ug9y9matKSc/s1600/312_l08_ext_crystal_empire_downshot_with_stadium.jpg
<DoctoDoctorWho> anyone think the crystal ponies still looked cute even when they were depressed?
<Zamer> still resembles a giant snowflake to me
<CrystalPhoenix> Diamond_Tiara_2012, it's where the jousting happens?
<FlutterMEDIC> Diamond_Tiara_2012: huh, didnt notice that
<HoodyNinja> Ello Brownie state
<Rex_Mundi> See look, red eyes http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT40d7npB8UxVsVOaWx0gr1DoxTyMGz6SMOBZQx975sgj7zppy5oPNIIH8Glg
<FlutterMEDIC> CrystalPhoenix: no, the jousting took place outside
<HoodyNinja> Who picked finding nemo? I must love them
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> that 80s pony
<aniderp1> its a game..
<CCCP> Hello
<TROctavia> It's layed out as if they all worked in the center hub, but there's nothing there for ponies to work with!
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
<FlutterMEDIC> hi CCCP
<RaveBrony> HoodyNinja, it says it on the page :D
<HoodyNinja> ello CCCP

<HoodyNinja> RaveBrony: Sorry, forgot to read :P THANK YOU
<Lil_B> now that I look at it... the houses in that City look rather ... Cave Man like... in comparison to the Main Castle-Tower-AlienSpaceship
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai! :3
<RaveBrony> Hey CCCP! :$
<RaveBrony> HoodyNinja: Np, glad you like it :)
<Lil_B> Hi thar CCCP !

<HoodyNinja> 'Lo
<CCCP> RaveBrony good just watched the new episode
*thelonepony hugs HoodyNinja :3
<CCCP> hi thelonepony
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> grouphug
<RaveBrony> Awesome! :3
<HoodyNinja> Bronystate makes me lethargic
<aniderp1> another game..
<HoodyNinja> CCCP: Thoughts?
<CCCP> HoodyNinja i liked it :3
<TROctavia> excuse me for a second, looking up lethargic..
<HoodyNinja> Villian?
<Rex_Mundi> You know what I dislike? People saying that Celestia is Twilights mother figure... she has a mother already, Celestia taking over that role is kinda creepy.
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> 5/5 from me
<HoodyNinja> TROctavia: Lazy
<DoctoDoctorWho> Did the crystal ponies have crystal unicorns and pegasi too? I dont remember seeing any.
<Zamer> no
<Rex_Mundi> Only Crystal earth ponies
<HoodyNinja> Maybe the crystal ponies are a race of their own
<aniderp1> only see the new episode for that..
<Zamer> pure earth excluding mane 6 shining armor spike and Candance
<TROctavia> eh. im too lethargic to look up lethargic
<CCCP> I liked the songs :3
<HoodyNinja> Songs were meh
<DoctoDoctorWho> So theyre a different race of pony entirely.
<HoodyNinja> Hated the history song
<HoodyNinja> HORSES
<TROctavia> I liked the reprise of Failure Success at the end
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> horse jokes
<HoodyNinja> ^
<xles> Crystal Empire = Only earth ponies, yet their armor for jousting has holes for wings.
<CCCP> TROctavia same
<aniderp1> i found something
<aniderp1> diferent
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> liked the reprise version too
<jerry2600> what was luna holding?
<HoodyNinja> A book with stars and swirls on it
<Zamer> a starswhirled the bearded book
<Rex_Mundi> DoctoDoctorWho: Nah, they are just normal Earth ponies that become crystalized because of the heart
<aniderp1> princess promenade
<CCCP> I liked the reprise verson more actually
<DoctoDoctorWho> xles: they were prolly relics from the old pegasi warrior culture
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Starswirl episode I guess
<jerry2600> @Zamer: ah thanks
<xles> DoctoDoctorWho: Possibly. =)
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<aniderp1> oh god..
<HoodyNinja> Oi DerpyMuffins
<thelonepony> Hi DerpyMuffins :)
<TROctavia> hello
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> good evening
<HoodyNinja> How goes it?
*Socks hugs DerpyMuffins
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai DerpyMuffins :)
<aniderp1> them small fairy ponies
<DerpyMuffins> Back to the usual crowd I see
<HoodyNinja> Maybe >_><_<
<CCCP> Hello DerpyMuffins
<Rex_Mundi> Are we allowed to discuss the new race that were shown next to Celestia in one of the season 3 commercial, or is that too much of a spoiler topic?
<DerpyMuffins> Any S3 spoilder not shown yet is bannable
<CCCP> How many people were on here yesterday?
<DerpyMuffins> 3.4k
<Rex_Mundi> But is it a spoiler?
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
<Zamer> they obviously came from the human realm
<thelonepony> ^^
<CrystalPhoenix> That's a good question
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> humans in Equestria!
<HoodyNinja> No
<xles> Rule of thumb; All future events are spoilers.
<HoodyNinja> Just, no
<thelonepony> HoodyNinja: /)
<cowvarkian> so what about discussing what pinkie did to her face
<CrystalPhoenix> since we don't know ANYTHING about them and it was shown pretty much worldwide
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> all my no for HiE
<HoodyNinja> If its on a commercial, i dont' think it should be a spoiler
<Rex_Mundi> Megan and Applejack could get rescued by Seaponies.
<cowvarkian> bacon and applejack
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Shoo be doo
<Zamer> they said there will be no seaponies in S3 though
<cowvarkian> Zamer: who are these they
<HoodyNinja> It was great
<Alchemist> HoodyNinja: they considered the enite Ep1 a spoiler though 8 minutes was released of it
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: Im pretty sure crystal pony is another pony race, as earth ponies "defining characteristic" is that they have a deeper connection to the earth. thats what allowed them to be such good farmers in the olden times. CP's seem like a jack of all trades culture center instead of converted earth ponies.
<J_E_Smith71> Well it's been 24 hours we can talk about the first two eps now I think
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> tons of fun
<HoodyNinja> Holy text
<cowvarkian> batman
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> that wall of .txt
<DerpyMuffins> We should double check with the mods
*HoodyNinja shines the batsignal
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> check the checklist
<DoctoDoctorWho> Phase not here, :(
<cowvarkian> >.>
<CCCP> dat feel when there are only 11 episodes left of this season
<Rex_Mundi> DoctoDoctorWho: Nay, I like the idea that there are only 3 races of ponies (Alicorns dont count), having Crystal ponies be a 4th race would ruin that... whats next, Seaponies? Flutterponies? Breezies?!
<xles> Also it's worth noting that the highlights in the eyes of the crystal ponies isn't round, it's a polygon.
<HoodyNinja> Ugh, have to go to the MUSEUM today :S
<RaveBrony> :(
<cowvarkian> HoodyNinja: what's so bad about museums
<CCCP> HoodyNinja what kind of museum?
<TROctavia> lack of ponies, cowvarkian
<HoodyNinja> cowvarkian: I have to go with my family
<Alchemist> Anyways, we didnt get to know much about the crystal ponies did we?
<SafariMonkey> Hey guys!
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> only 11 but all that worth
<HoodyNinja> CCCP: The sucky kind
<Prince_Blueblood> enjoy your family while you have them.
<HoodyNinja> Oi SafariMonkey
<aniderp1> the sea ponies song and fma xD
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
<Prince_Blueblood> they won't be around forever
<cowvarkian> yay, dark foreshadowing
<HoodyNinja> Prince_Blueblood: My family is crazy
<Rex_Mundi> Alchemist: Something tells me that we will learn more about the Crystal Ponies in future episodes. I also hope we havt seen the last of Sombra.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: It wouldnt ruin it, I infact like the crystal ponies and dont think they'll go farther if they know whats good for them.
<Prince_Blueblood> like what kind of crazy?
<CCCP> HoodyNinja :I i like museums
<HoodyNinja> Rex_Mundi: I do
<Prince_Blueblood> My grandmother is literally crazy
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Im love trains
<spyrofan001> hi cynder7
<Prince_Blueblood> she's a fundy but I still love her in a weird way lol
<HoodyNinja> Prince_Blueblood: The kind where we'll probably get kicked out for
<cowvarkian> Prince_Blueblood: mine is getting there
<Prince_Blueblood> ah
<spyrofan001> hi Cynder7
<MrPie309> bahhh
<cowvarkian> humbug
<DoctoDoctorWho> Prince_Blueblood: Im making a fic about blueblood, huh.
<Prince_Blueblood> that's nice
<cowvarkian> brb
<HoodyNinja> CCCP: Its a cheap museum, similar to a museum built into a house
<spyrofan001> Hi Kimori
<TROctavia> Oh, those are boring
<Alchemist> this sums up Sombre pretty well http://theflashguy.deviantart.com/art/The-Confrontation-S3-spoiler-337043511
<CCCP> HoodyNinja oh :/
<Rex_Mundi> I just think that Sombra has more potential and should be developed a bit more before he is gone forever, I also want Nightmaremoon to return somehow.
<HoodyNinja> All they have is a few basic science experiments
*DoctoDoctorWho train hits Diamond_Tiara_2012
<CCCP> Alchemist O_O
<Alchemist> What?
<CrystalPhoenix> inb4 Sombrero will become the fan favorite at the end of season 3
<Rex_Mundi> Alchemist: :D
<HoodyNinja> Alchemist: I laughed
<thelonepony> Alchemist: :D
<HoodyNinja> inb4 CrystalPhoenix gets shot
<aniderp1> sea ponies song xD
<cowvarkian> sombrero vs gak
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> inb4 Sombre does not return and another
<aniderp1> oh god
<thelonepony> cowvarkian: Sombrero wins
<HoodyNinja> This reminds me, I have a sombrero
<CrystalPhoenix> http://www.deviantart.com/#/d5kr320
<TROctavia> Who says you can't make a gak sombrero?
<cowvarkian> thelonepony: none can defeat the mighty gak
<thelonepony> D:
<Chrysalis> You do know the first ep is still under spoiler rules?
<thelonepony> :I
<Prince_Blueblood> I'm not a fan of sombrero
<HoodyNinja> CrystalPhoenix: HNGH I need to see that
<CrystalPhoenix> Chrysalis, 24 hours has passed
<Prince_Blueblood> too dark
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> none can stop the smooze
<Saturn> 08,01sombrero was not a proper villian
<Saturn> 08,01Tom had more personality
<thelonepony> ^
<HoodyNinja> ^^*
<TROctavia> lol
<thelonepony> :D
<cowvarkian> sombrero is best S3 villain so far
<Rex_Mundi> Gak is the Smooze. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CnOysetlQw
<Prince_Blueblood> that isn't saying much
<HoodyNinja> cowvarkian: TRIXIE
<cowvarkian> Prince_Blueblood: thats the point
<Alchemist> Rainbow Dash is best villain in S3 so far
<Prince_Blueblood> lol
<Cynder7> 6Hello ^^
<Alchemist> She was just evil and a douche for jousting with Fluttershy
<Saturn> 08,01sombra comes from the spanish for 'shadow'
<Rex_Mundi> Saturn: Latin
<HoodyNinja> I thought it was spanish
<Saturn> 08,01same root, obviously, as sombre, a shadowy mood
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01La sombra
<Saturn> 08,01and sombrero, a hat that casts a shadow
<CCCP> lol
<TROctavia> I suppose sombrero therefore has something to do with shade
*HoodyNinja dances around a sombrero
<TROctavia> there we go
*Saturn 08,01is stephen fry
<J_E_Smith71> Sombra De Amigo
<HoodyNinja> I have no idea who that is
<DRHUnleashed> mexican hat dance
<Saturn> 08,01fat, gay, and knowlegable
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Cute cenera
<CrystalPhoenix> Saturn, does that mean King Sombrero can be canon?
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<Alchemist> Are we talking about Stephen Fry and language? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7E-aoXLZGY
<DoctoDoctorWho> Anypony think the CP's still look cute even when they're depressed?
<spyrofan001> whats up?
<HoodyNinja> ^
<cowvarkian> Saturn: >_>
<Chrysalis> Saturn is stephen fry?
<CCCP> DoctoDoctorWho yes :3
<Chrysalis> awesome you in the enxt v for Vandetta then Saturn?
<xles> I'm not sure you can make canon ponies not cute.
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: I could buy it
<Lil_B> ohi Saturn and Alchemist !
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> depress CP too cute
<Alchemist> hi Lil_B !
<aniderp1> i think i found the one you were talking about
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
<Prince_Blueblood> I didn't watch the first ep yet, is there any mention of that ugly princess skyla thing?
<CCCP> Is It breaking rules if you talk about the episode? :S
<HoodyNinja> Lil_B: Oy, why you so little?
<Prince_Blueblood> no
<Prince_Blueblood> 24 hour rule
<Lil_B> amd hi DoctoDoctorWho MLP_Brovakiin and cowvarkian
<Saturn> 08,01not anymore!
<Zamer> China why you fail http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/560590_454040897967208_640508748_n.jpg
<cowvarkian> Saturn: good to know
<HoodyNinja> I loved the ep, hated the villian
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hiya Lil_B :3
<Yahooz> he doesnt violate it by 3 hours
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
<cowvarkian> Zamer: that seems fake
<CCCP> I was happy when Spike sang :)
<Prince_Blueblood> I'll take it that there's no ugly skyla
<Rex_Mundi> Prince_Blueblood: Maybe Cadance will have a daughter this season?
<Lil_B> HoodyNinja because, I'm not the greatest :3
<HoodyNinja> I was happy when spike did something
<Yahooz> Prince_Blueblood: nope
<Prince_Blueblood> ah good. at least not yet.
<Prince_Blueblood> lol
<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: Spike singing made me laugh out loud :D
<Yahooz> no spoilers >_<
<CCCP> MLP_Brovakiin hehe
<xles> hmm... I have this feeling I was supposed to talk to Saturn about something.
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Spike sang OMG!
<CCCP> Yahooz you hvn't seen it?
<TROctavia> The line of "share of licks" + spike ballerina dancing made me lol.
<Yahooz> i have
<Prince_Blueblood> I haven't seen it either I just don't care
<Yahooz> but hes ... forget it
<Prince_Blueblood> spoilers haven't really made episodes any less enjoyable for me yet
<Lil_B> I was confused when Twilight used the Gravity Spell... with all these sparks I was thinking that this might be harmful for her hoofes
<DoctoDoctorWho> I think its safe to use the EoH again now
<Yahooz> Prince_Blueblood: no but literally, saying spoilers here gets you banned
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Gravity fall spell
<HoodyNinja> Lil_B: HAX
<CCCP> Lil_B yeah seems like it must of hurt
<Yahooz> no questions asked
<Cynder7> 6Not much,just playing on the PS3 and stuff :P
<Rex_Mundi> Anyways, I belive the title of 'Prince' and 'Princess' is simple Equestria tittle for any lord or lady (possible only ones related to Celestia and Luna), thats why Prince Blue Blood and Cadance have those titles.
<Cynder7> 6You?
<HoodyNinja> SPOILERS: Future S3 eps will have ponies
<Alchemist> Lil_B: I was more annoyed how she refuses to use teleportation when it would actually be really convenient.
<MrPie309> I need help naming my town in minecraft what shall i call it (its all snow)
<Verspa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWG0KLSJi8g&feature=plcp
<mitamaking> Crystals........
<Rex_Mundi> HoodyNinja: What if they dont have ponies?
<CCCP> HoodyNinja what if they didn't?
<mitamaking> rarrrrrrgghhh
<spyrofan001> lessioning to muisc
<HoodyNinja> Alchemist: I think teleportation works like yuou have to see or know your destination
<Lil_B> Alchemist yeah :/ at fiurst I thought "well... why dodn't you just teleport yourself up there?!"
<aniderp1> pinkie and minty darling
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> My little dragon
<aniderp1> oh god xD
<spyrofan001> *music
<HoodyNinja> You can't just whisk yourself off to someplace you dodn't know
<aniderp1> pinkie and minty holding hooves <3
<Rex_Mundi> The Spike and Discord show
<Stallion_of_War> I was surprised that Shining Armor didn't run into the Snow Monster from Hoth, what with him being dressed up as Han Solo and all.
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> S3 needs Minty
<aniderp1> remember
<HoodyNinja> ^
<aniderp1> that live show
<Alchemist> HoodyNinja: when she was trapped after retrieving the crystal heart she teleported herself outside of the black crystal cell
<HoodyNinja> I wouldn't mind
<aniderp1> pinkie x minty
<Noert> Hi ponies
<J_E_Smith71> Wait a second, is the episode encore going to be moved today sometime?
<Noert> Hi SB64 :)
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
<HoodyNinja> Alchemist: She had seen/ could see outside the ring of crystals
<mitamaking> Celestia was behind Sombra, heard it here first
<Rex_Mundi> Diamond_Tiara_2012: If Miny is in g4, it would make the Old-School pony fans very happy, like what happened with Blossomforth.
<Cynder7> 6:O What you listening to?
<Alchemist> HoodyNinja: couldnt she then teleport a few flights of stairs higher?
<Stallion_of_War> Celestia knows Dark Magic cannonically now; this pleases us.
<Noert> What's on?
<thelonepony> not much
<thelonepony> just discussion
<thelonepony> :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> As far as I've seen, s3 was okay. The only complaint I have is we did'nt get alot of characterization on sombra. That however, does not make him bad. As far as sombra goes, I say 6.5/10
<HoodyNinja> Alchemist: I'm pretty sure its dagerous to, or took more energy than the gravity spell
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> just a blank screen
<mitamaking> I don't know what to make of dark magic, it could go bad
<Alchemist> HoodyNinja: or what you are saying is she can teleport to places she have seen at least once?
<Lil_B> Stallion_of_War AND sher taught Twilight too :P
<Lil_B> she*
<thelonepony> Diamond_Tiara_2012: No, The Buffer Show is on:3
<Noert> Ah
<alexxm> mitamaking thats why it's called dark magic
<Saturn> 08,01so i just got the numbers for the premiere from our analytics
<VenHur> Hello everyone...that premire the other day REALLY was crazy, huh?
<Rex_Mundi> Its Canon, Twilight know dark magic now as well.

<thelonepony> Saturn: Wow :O
<TROctavia> This commercial I'm watching on the Golf Channel is about a girl named Cadance.. my god..
<Alchemist> HoodyNinja: that actually makes sense :)
<HoodyNinja> Pff 17k
<Lil_B> Saturn and how many had the wedding again?
<mitamaking> Did that beat the wedding?
<Spyrorocks> this guy is selling a ps3 on craigslist that works but sometimes it shows a red light for $20... wonder if i should pick it up and try to fix it...
<Saturn> 08,01that's the highest viewer count we've ever had
<VenHur> Over 16,591 Bronies?!
<Alchemist> I dont think so.
<mitamaking> nice
<Stallion_of_War> So wait, Twilight's Voiced by Tara Strong, and she knows dark magic... - http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/096/a/3/twilight_raven_by_projectzuel-d4v7nmj.png
<Alchemist> Wedding was about 20k, no?
<VenHur> YES, THE FORCE IS BECOMING STRONGER EVER DAYS!
<CCCP> Gak
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: what date was that?
<VenHur> *every
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> over 16,000?
<HoodyNinja> Saturn: Crystal ponies be popular
<mitamaking> Stallion_of_War: :o your right
<Rex_Mundi> Hey guys, Pinkie Pie has her own episode. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KKfym7NuoE
<Stallion_of_War> Is Twilight's middle name Raven?
<HoodyNinja> Stallion_of_War: I want one, how much
<Cynder7> 6:O
<CrystalPhoenix> welp I just sudenly got a Stephen Fry adoration
<spyrofan001> I dont know if you should
<Stallion_of_War> It's not my art; I found the link
<Cynder7> 6I guess it would be worth a shot..Idk..
<mitamaking> Twillight is Raven confirmed
<Lil_B> Saturn good question : (
<Stallion_of_War> Twilight R. Sparkle?
<spyrofan001> it might be
<Alchemist> Saturn: wedding was at april 21th
<Zamer> Ponies have middle names?
<CrystalPhoenix> Twilight Raven Sparkle
<VenHur> Stallion_of_War: Hillarious and interesting since Twilight and Raven are voiced by the same actress.
<CrystalPhoenix> Now I want twilight to yell her magic words
<VenHur> Tara Strong.
<TROctavia> Yes
<Alchemist> I mean 21st
<Alchemist> dammit
<Lil_B> Saturn April 21, 2012

<TROctavia> Pinkamena Diane Pie, right?
<HoodyNinja> CrystalPhoenix: PONY FRIENDSHIP CANNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<CCCP> Goodbye everyone
<Stallion_of_War> I wonder if Tara uses her maiden name as her middle name or if she uses something else.
<Zamer> Azeroth Metrenos Zenthos
<thelonepony> bye CCCP :)
<HoodyNinja> Pinkamena Responsibility Diane Pie
<VenHur> Rex_Mundi: You...son of a Rick Ashley!
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> cya
<Lil_B> bye CCCP
<Stallion_of_War> It's Lyn, nevermind
<HoodyNinja> latas CCCP
<TROctavia> lol
<Spyrorocks> worst case I smash it and get $20 worth of fun.
<Cypresswolf> With those numbers - Season 4 25,000 uniques viewers! I'm writing that number down, putting it somewhere safe (pony drink recipe book) and this time next year, we'll see if Im right
<Spyrorocks> best case I fix it and give it away to a friend or something because i dont care for console games
<Alchemist> Wow, Tara Strong is only 159 cm tall?
<aniderp1> idk if i found the episode..
<HoodyNinja> Cypresswolf: 50 bucks if you are
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Noert :3
<aniderp1> but princess rarity
<thelonepony> :O
<Cypresswolf> HoodyNinja: writing that down too :)
<mitamaking> Cypresswolf: Depends on how good the rest of season 3 is, but with a Trixie episode....
<HoodyNinja> :$
*thelonepony Hugs SuperBrony64 :3
<HoodyNinja> TRIXIE
<aniderp1> and crystal carriage
<SuperBrony64> 11,02o.o
<Rex_Mundi> Ponies dont all have family names, and these are not part of the ponies names. For example, Twilights first name is twilight, and her last name is Sparkle. But her family name isnt Sparkle. Applejack just has 1 name, but her family is the 'Apple' family.
<Lil_B> hey thar SuperBrony64 !
*SuperBrony64 hugs thelonepony back :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Lil_B: Hai :D
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, when was the last time you streamed something?
<mitamaking> Keep an eye on the numbers for episode 5 this season, I am expected Canterlot Wedding numbers there
*thelonepony gives SuperBrony64 cookies :3
<HoodyNinja> Rex_Mundi: Oh no, pony culture. I'll get the aspirin
<Punkie_Pue> Hello
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: what about the Cakes?
<VenHur> If Celestia also known Dark Magic...then I hates to see what's her mother's magic are.
<Stallion_of_War> Canterlot > British Royal Wedding
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrystalPhoenix: Couple days ago I think O~O
<thelonepony> Hi Punkie_Pue :)
*SuperBrony64 noms on the cookies :3c
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, can you be a bit more precise please?
<HoodyNinja> Punkie_Pue: Hai :3
<TROctavia> Pound Cake.
<thelonepony> :3
<Stallion_of_War> What was Cup Cake's maiden name?
<Ryunosuke> SuperBrony64, hows the wiiu countdown :)
<HoodyNinja> Cake family
<Alchemist> so Sumi finally decided to have some sleep already? :D
<mitamaking> Let me just say, season 3 may be just a bit darker than the first 2
<Stallion_of_War> or would that be filly name?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrystalPhoenix: When I streamed Pacman Championship Edition DX
<spyrofan001> ok
<HoodyNinja> I think Pinkie Pie and the Cakes are related
<HoodyNinja> Pie and Cake
<Stallion_of_War> YAH DARKER SEASON!

<JamesClydesdale> The 5th episode already came out?? I haven't even saw the 1st episode of the season 3 :c

<HoodyNinja> Silly SB, S3 isn't over yet
<rally153> Want me to do it again :D
<Noert> Lol dat SB
<Cynder7> 6xD
<VenHur> SuperBrony64: ...We haven't even finished the season.
<aniderp1> no
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, I'm curious about you opinion
<rally153> 3:
<spyrofan001> im thinking about game ideas that should be made but will not be
<thelonepony> SuperBrony64: But we havent seen the rest of the season ;3;
<pony_7777> it hasnt even started yet
<Alchemist> Yeah, MLP sucks, all hail Littlest Petshop!
<mitamaking> Also, come on bigger role for Spike this season
<Noert> Trolling silly foals ;)
<Stallion_of_War> King Sombre = Lost Smoke Monster?
<JamesClydesdale> I haven't even seen the 1st episode :c where can I find it? :O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The show has already jumped the shark after only two seasons.
<HoodyNinja> Alchemist: Is that any good? I didn't catch it
<VenHur> All hails Twilight Barkle!
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 I think the franchise redeemed itself with Season 5
<CrystalPhoenix> to be honest the more I watch the premiere the more I love it
<Alchemist> HoodyNinja: me neither, though I'd like to.
<thelonepony> SuperBrony64: But we havent seen the rest of the season ;3;
<Cynder7> 6I've done that too x)
<HoodyNinja> SuperBrony64: You're not much of a "Super" brony
<mitamaking> HoodyNinja: He is 64 though
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo :3
<JamesClydesdale> is the first episode on youtube?
<Punkie_Pue> Lol
<Cynder7> 6Brb,need to kill a Bat Drone..
<VenHur> SuperBrony64: Well, it DID jumped over the shark, but can it jumps over Mount Everest?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02HoodyNinja: ;~;
<Punkie_Pue> Yes
<Rex_Mundi> CrystalPhoenix: Yeah, once you dont have the ubnreasonable expectations that Discord and the Royal wedding made, its easier to enjow.
<Stallion_of_War> Oi! I liked the premier.
<Ryunosuke> the problem I have with bronies, myself included, is that we are comparing Sombra to Discord, we are comparing any villian, to JOHN DELANCY being Q :p
<CrystalPhoenix> JamesClydesdale, indeed
<mitamaking> JamesClydesdale: yes, just go find it
<HoodyNinja> :3
<Lil_B> HoodyNinja you mean super "brony"

<VenHur> Punkie_Pue: THEN IT'S THE GREATEST MASTERPIECE OF MY HAPPY MISERABLE LIFE!
<spyrofan001> i wish they would make games people think of
<mitamaking> Ryunosuke: Chrysallius(sp) made it out okay)
<Chrysalis> JamesClydesdale yup
<HoodyNinja> Lil_B: I don't know...
<Stallion_of_War> Why does everypony hate the premier so much?
<JamesClydesdale> okay
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The premiere was OK, I just hope there's a Derpy episode :3
<VenHur> ^
<JamesClydesdale> Thanks guys, and bye!
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, there won't
<HoodyNinja> TRIXIE EP
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Later JamesClydesdale!
<mitamaking> Stallion_of_War: hype, same thing happened to me with the wedding
<thelonepony> what Sb said :3
<CrystalPhoenix> and stop putting Derpy in the high pedestal
<pony_7777> i hope theres a princess only ep
<VenHur> ...Discord episode? [fangirl squees]
<Verspa> Discord episode? SHIT!
<mitamaking> pony_7777: So a Twillight episode
<spyrofan001> but theyy wont which sucks :(
<Noert> I hope there's Octavia ep
<thelonepony> pony_7777: i hope it's a luna Episode
<Lil_B> Season 5 was best, writing by Michael Bay and Uwe Boll, starring Tommy Wiseau. It couldn't not fail
<CrystalPhoenix> princess only episode would make more sense
<HoodyNinja> CrystalPhoenix: I hope there's a Derpy ep :C
<Alchemist> People hated the premiere? thats news to me. I thought most people were okay with it. I think it was pretty good apart a few annoyances.
<Punkie_Pue> Venhur: I was responding to something else
<Ryunosuke> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Stallion_of_War> Magic Fillies episode coming
<CrystalPhoenix> Octavia episode would be horrible
<Ryunosuke> NEXT WEEK
<Ryunosuke> :p
<CrystalPhoenix> HoodyNinja, there won't
<Rex_Mundi> I love how it was Berry punch randomnly in the stand rather than Derpy, what was she doing there?! http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/5224/crystaljousting.png
<Stormy> that's why you learn to make games and make it yourself. :)
<Noert> What
<Noert> How dare you
<VenHur> CrystalPhoenix: Something's missing...
<RobotdragonX> EY everypony
<Ryunosuke> iirc next week at 1030 is a new episode as well
<Alchemist> People usually make the mistake of overanalysing this. In the end we are talking about a kid's show, not fraking Inception
<Verspa> Chrystal Ponies.....Everywhere
<VenHur> What could it obviously be...
<CrystalPhoenix> WHAT THE FUCK
<pony_7777> like a luna episode where they show her doing stuff in the palace and talking to celestia and stuff
<CrystalPhoenix> How is Berry Punch in there
<HoodyNinja> Berry, go home
<CrystalPhoenix> wat
<mitamaking> So did anypony ever find Derpy?
<Ryunosuke> I will say this
<HoodyNinja> You're drunk
<CrystalPhoenix> Berry Punch is the new Derpy
<CrystalPhoenix> it's official
<Punkie_Pue> I looked and didnt see her
<HoodyNinja> No, no
<VenHur> GO HOME BERRY PUNCH. YOU'RE DRUNK
<Cypresswolf> Berry Punch heard legends of crystal pony brews?
<HoodyNinja> We need more lemon pledge
<Ryunosuke> after s3 ep1-2 Cadence makes a HELL of a lot more sense than when we seen her at the wedding
<aniderp1> people made minty x pinkie vids
<thelonepony> VenHur: to late, HoodyNinja already said it
<thelonepony> too*
<SuperBrony64> 11,02imma moo \:3/
<pony_7777> who wants a luna ep?
<HoodyNinja> QUAAAAAAAAAAAACK
<thelonepony> Mooooooo
<mitamaking> Still don't know why she was princess Candace in the wedding
<VenHur> Moooo!
<CrystalPhoenix> Ryunosuke, there was something odd with her to begin with
<sub06905> suddenly a wild SuperBrony64
<Cypresswolf> Me! memememememememe
<Stallion_of_War> Does Prince Blueblood rule over a kingdom of lawful good Vampires then?
<thelonepony> or better yet....
<CrystalPhoenix> with the Hair and all
<Verspa> GUYS!
<thelonepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4XAVxhlwGQ&feature=related
<thelonepony> :3
<mitamaking> Forget moo, GAK is BAK
<spyrofan001> thats what im thinking about doing ut i dont knoe how i would be able to use spyro
<Verspa> AT WIKIPEDIA
<Ryunosuke> mitamaking, apparently she is the princess of the crystal kingdom?
<Verspa> HOLY SHIT!
<Alchemist> Ryunosuke: and I love that it seems the writers already knew what they were gong to do with her character.
<Verspa> FUCK! TRIXIE APPEARS AND THIS TIME SHE WINS THE FUCK OUT OF TWILIGHT
<VenHur> sub0605: WILD MILTANK APPEARED
<mitamaking> Ryunosuke: They just found that out now though
<Spyrorocks> if you don't make money off of it, they would probably allow it.
<sub06905> VenHur, :D
<Stormy> they don't care as long as you don't try to sell the game
<CrystalPhoenix> Ryunosuke, apparently? SHE IS there's no denying that
<spyrofan001> true
<Stormy> It's like fan art
<TROctavia> links or it didnt happen
<Stallion_of_War> Twilight becomes the Avatar this season too, apparently.
<thelonepony> Verspa: let's not talk about future episodes, pls :S
<Stormy> It's technically not allowed but no one cares about it
<CrystalPhoenix> even one of the crystal ponies said it
<Verspa> Mkay
<Lil_B> well, bye everyone, see you all toimorrow :)
<RobotdragonX> i liked king sombra, he seemed like a sentient monster.
<TROctavia> bai b
<thelonepony> Bye Lil_B :)
<Ryunosuke> well true :p
<HoodyNinja> I don't think they should concentrate on Twilight too heavily :S
<CrystalPhoenix> RobotdragonX, YES THANK YOU
<Ryunosuke> it still makes it apparent :)
<Stallion_of_War> RobotdragonX: Smoke Monster from lost
<VenHur> It's not long until the fire nation attacked, Stallion_of_War.
<mitamaking> I get that she is the Crystal Princess now, but she wasn't at the wedding
<Alchemist> CrystalPhoenix: not to mention that her cutie mark is actually the crystal freaking heart :D
<RobotdragonX> CrystalPhoenix ur welcome
*Lil_B hugs TROctavia and thelonepony :)
<Ryunosuke> mitamaking, how do we know she wasnt?
<RobotdragonX> cool design as well
<CrystalPhoenix> Alchemist, that as well
<spyrofan001> then im going to make it but not sell it for money for fun
<Ryunosuke> she was just "a" princess
<mitamaking> Ryunosuke: Are they showing it out of order?
<Ryunosuke> but didnt specify of what :)
<Stallion_of_War> For awhile I sort of though the whole Chrystal Heart thing was a metaphore and they we're going to power up Cadance's butt.
<Ryunosuke> I think hasabro/hub is trolling us :p
<HoodyNinja> That... would be interesting
<Stallion_of_War> Since her cutie mark is the crystal heart and all
<Alchemist> What is a powered up butt looks like?
<VenHur> I wonder if dark magic is very limited and dangerous...
<RobotdragonX> Stallion_of_War i lold
<HoodyNinja> VenHur: WE MUST HARVEST THE DARK ECO
<mitamaking> VenHur: Well it nearly drove Twillight and Spike nuts
<MadSurge> Ohai Bronystate :)
<Rex_Mundi> Yeah, I think 'Prince' and 'Princess' is simply Equestria title for lord and lady. Celestia is only "Princess" because there can be only 1 queen and she doesnt want to seem more important than Luna.
<Alchemist> Hi MadSurge !
<Stallion_of_War> VenHur: If we can even slightly bring Raven from Teen Titans into this, given Twilight shares her VA, then yes; yes it is.
<HoodyNinja> Ohai MadSurge
<CrystalPhoenix> I also notice how in the episode it use a double dimension play
<RobotdragonX> HoodyNinja eco freak >:p
<CountDoofus> Haio MadSurge
<HoodyNinja> Stop being on fire
<Ryunosuke> from what I gathered, and thought about, and makes the MOST sense, is that Cadence went into exile when sobra cast his... disappearing spell on the crystal kingdom
<Klumzeedragon> Hello eveyone~ :)
<thelonepony> Hi MadSurge :)
<TROctavia> hello
<RobotdragonX> Hoody ninja oh wait that was supposed to be another face..
<HoodyNinja> ello Klumzeedragon
<Ryunosuke> that would explain why celestia knew alot about it, and why cadence was there in the first place
<thelonepony> Hi Klumzeedragon :)
<mitamaking> Ryunosuke: That is a background story they really should have mentioned if true
<HoodyNinja> Long time no see
<CrystalPhoenix> by that I mean like when Twilight was searching for the heart she used Hatred toward a crystal to reflect a dark world
<VenHur> Tara Strong also voices lesser known characters.
<Stallion_of_War> SWEET CELESTIA!
<DerpyMuffins> Hey SuperBrony64, you gonna wait in line for a Wiiu?
*thelonepony nons on Klumzeedragon and MadSurge :3
<Rex_Mundi> Ryunosuke: I dont think Cadance is long lived like Celestia and Luna.
<HoodyNinja> STOP POSTING IM TRYING TO READ
<Stallion_of_War> CRYSTALS IN THE NORTH! LAST OF THE CRYSTAL PONIES... CADANCE IS SUPERMAN!
<Alchemist> Ryunosuke: but that was 1000 years ago, and when she was babysitting twilight she seemed to be in her early teens (if that makes sense)
<VenHur> Ember from Danny Phantom, Timmy Turner, and Hello Kitty.
<RobotdragonX> with all that sh*t happening no wonder luna decided to go vigilante style....
<spyrofan001> for free
<mitamaking> VenHur: You will remember her name
<CountDoofus> Wasn't Luna in the moon 1,000 years ago?
<Klumzeedragon> thelonepony: Do I taste good? :D
<CrystalPhoenix> then at the bottom she used love to the dark crystal at the door leading to the staircase
<thelonepony> Klumzeedragon: Yes :3
<Rex_Mundi> CountDoofus: This was before she was banished
<HoodyNinja> 1000 years is a rough estimate
<Alchemist> CountDoofus: maybe she was cast out after defeating Sombre.
<mitamaking> CountDoofus: Another thing, think Sombra's rise had to do with Nightmare Moon
<Ryunosuke> however Luna looked like a filly in ML:P premier and grew up by the time of luna eclipsed :)
<TROctavia> Wait.. was she in the moon or on the moon?
<CountDoofus> *In* the moon.
<TROctavia> so did she experience the 1000 years?
<mitamaking> The Mare IN the Moon
<HoodyNinja> Ugh, pony theories
<RobotdragonX> i thought the mane six turning into crystal ponies was pointless. its not even 30 SECONDS!
<TROctavia> or was in like, a few seconds to her
<HoodyNinja> This makes my head hurt
<HoodyNinja> K, I gots ta leave
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DerpyMuffins: Yesh, but I'll have to wait in line the morning of, there's not going to be a midnight launch for it at my GameStop :/
<HoodyNinja> See yalls lata
<Stallion_of_War> The Sillouette Celestia and Luna from 1000 years ago should have looked different.
<mitamaking> RobotdragonX: It's a......... Rarity...;p
<TROctavia> bai
<VenHur> One thing we don't know is WHY whould Celestia banished her sister to the moon in the first place. And no, it's not the bananas.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Cya TROctavia
<CountDoofus> Probably some kind of cryogenics going on there.
<DerpyMuffins> Cya TROctavia
<Klumzeedragon> Dat SuperBrony64.
<sub06905> SuperBrony64, go there super early to be first in line?
<RobotdragonX> mitamaking i see what u did there.....
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Later HoodyNinja :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:)
<CrystalPhoenix> mitamaking, that quote from AJ has spark my shipping sense
<TROctavia> I meant bai HoodyNinja* o.o
<VenHur> See ya TROctavia.
<Alchemist> VenHur: yeah all we know is that Luna "went nits"
<DerpyMuffins> SuperBrony64 Saturday right?
<spyrofan001> Hummm.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
<CountDoofus> VenHur: DO YOU LIKE BA- *slap*
<Alchemist> *nuts
<CrystalPhoenix> sub06905, Pinkie will be there first
<Ryunosuke> extreme jealousy?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02sub06905: I go there at midnight to wait in line :3
<sub06905> CrystalPhoenix, :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DerpyMuffins: Sunday morning
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: :3
<sub06905> pack a tent SuperBrony64 :3
<CountDoofus> Wonder if we'll get to see more of the Crystal Empire.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Pinkie Pie will beat meh :<
<Gekoncze> hi Afflict
<VenHur> That or Freakazoid.
<Afflict> hey
<CrystalPhoenix> CountDoofus, that would be nice
<TROctavia> 2nd is the best though
<CrystalPhoenix> maybe a vacation stop and all
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Crystal Empire didn't exist, it's like Wyoming
<sub06905> SuperBrony64, pinkie will get all the Wii U's
<CrystalPhoenix> but I doubt they will do that
<Klumzeedragon> Pinkie Pie will be first and take all the systems.
<CountDoofus> Oh, that's another thing. If it's a Crystal EMPIRE, then why was it KING Sombra and not EMPEROR Sombra?
<Stallion_of_War> I'm still looking for the Fortress of Solitude in the premier...
<RobotdragonX> why hasnt there been sombra shipping yet.....i know its just a day after but come on, this is a big fandom....
<spyrofan001> hi
<TROctavia> Lol, Wyoming.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02sub06905: But...but...I has preorders ;~;
<Stallion_of_War> CountDoofus: Same reason it's not Emperess Cadance?
<CrystalPhoenix> CountDoofus, heh blame the writer
<mitamaking> CountDoofus: Illusion of not having that much power
<VenHur> CountDoofus: Good point...
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: because he wasn't the legitimate ruler, duh
<Rex_Mundi> The Crystal empire proves that nations of ponies exist besides Equestria. Im wondering that if the 3 tribes of ponies that made Equestria werent the only pony tribes and that there may still be tribes of ponies that havnt joined Equestria yet and are still distrustful of each other and Equestria.
<Ryunosuke> tbh CountDoofus, emporer and king are synonomous :p
<Alchemist> This is from S1E1. Thats all we know why Luna got banished: the younger sister became resentful and was jealous that under Celestia(daytime) ponies were happy and busy, while she could only rule the night.
<Klumzeedragon> CountDoofus: Because Higharchy.
<CountDoofus> RobotdragonX: Ship Sombra with Gak!
<sub06905> SuperBrony64, Pinkie doesnt know the meaning of pre-orders
<CountDoofus> Also, dem pings.
<CrystalPhoenix> RobotdragonX, because he didn't leave a huge impression
<SuperBrony64> 11,02sub06905: ;A;
<RobotdragonX> CrystalPhoenix ouch :(
<sub06905> :>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Then...she'll have to meet an unfortunate fate o-o
<RobotdragonX> CountDoofus lol
<CrystalPhoenix> also I could imagine King Sombra being the G4 smooze
<CountDoofus> Sombra: "RAWR I'm here!" *ponies: place Crystal Heart* Sombra: "Aw, maaaaaan."
<mitamaking> CrystalPhoenix: Have you seen the necklace?
<VenHur> So if Celestia and Luna rules the day and the night, who controls time and space then?
<VenHur> And no, i'm NOT pulling a Pokemon here.
<sub06905> SuperBrony64, implying you dont meet an unfourtante end first
<mitamaking> VenHur: Dr.Whooves
<sub06905> :>
<Rex_Mundi> So there wont be a new intro for seasoin 3? Or will there be a first show after the premire episodes like last season?
<Stallion_of_War> VenHur: Time Turner/Doctor Whooves
<CrystalPhoenix> mitamaking, not closely
<VenHur> Of course...
<CountDoofus> Cosmic Matriarch.
<Alchemist> VenHur: maybe time and space isnt controlled, its just "is"?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02sub06905: Moo o-o
<TROctavia> Alchemist, heresy.
<sub06905> moo :3
<RobotdragonX> CountDoofus i have retur-OH SH*T *ded*
<Rex_Mundi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo13WMTQJ84
<Alchemist> TROctavia: dont burn me at the stake.
<mitamaking> CrystalPhoenix: If it is what I think it is it is a continuing story
<TROctavia> Lol we good
<VenHur> Rex_Mundi: You...son of a jackal!
<mitamaking> G3 is canon in G4 now :)
<Stallion_of_War> King Sombre(ro)?
<TROctavia> Next step
<TROctavia> make G4 Canon in G3
<CountDoofus> Season finale: Twilight's studies will allow her to become an alicorn. I'm calling it.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek cookehs \:3/
<RobotdragonX> im starting to think the gak meme came from here...didnt it...
<VenHur> Was that face's G1 or G3...
<VenHur> My guess HAS to be G3, isn't it?
<Jmo> Correct RobotdragonX
<TROctavia> possibly
<VenHur> RobotdragonX: Correct.
<RobotdragonX> oh gosh *lols*
<pony_743> Have you watched any of the G3 cartoons?
<mitamaking> CountDoofus: Well it is pretty obvious now
<VenHur> Inb4 Bronystate becomes more well-known for the Gak Meme.
*thelonepony gives SuperBrony64 cookies :3
<Alchemist> hell no
<sub06905> no
<TROctavia> Dat Pinkie face.. if i was a lot younger, that'd of creeped me out
<RobotdragonX> sumerpan vs the GAK
<Rex_Mundi> CountDoofus: NO! I hate the idea of Twilight becoming an Alicorn, that would bring her to Mary Sue levels.
<CountDoofus> Any FiMfiction on fimfction with Gak in it gets you permabanned as well. Talk about a short fuse :)
<sub06905> i prefer summerpan
*SuperBrony64 noms on the cookies :3
<DerpyMuffins> First thing you gonna play SuperBrony64?
<thelonepony> VenHur: ..... Never >:I
<pony_2269> fagit
<Lunac> Hello SuperBrony64 Not seen you for a while.
<VenHur> Play Superman 64 from Titus!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DerpyMuffins: New Super Mario Bros. U :D
<VenHur> Oh.
<sub06905> :>
<Invi> hehe they found derpy in that episode yesterday ^^
<DerpyMuffins> Of course
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Lunac: You too o.o
<mitamaking> Invi: Where?
<Alchemist> Invi: in the premiere?
<Invi> ja
<Alchemist> Invi: coz thats a lie
<mitamaking> If you say the opening
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yeah, she's in it
<Invi> http://cheezburger.com/6755188992
<RobotdragonX> i drew sombra marrying that one purple maned crystal pony.......cuz i can.
<sub06905> dat ban
<Alchemist> Invi they just found a grey pony showed from the back
<CountDoofus> Rex_Mundi: I don't like the idea either. But there have been plenty of signs. It might just happen.
<Invi> Alchemist, from the side
<thelonepony> sub06905: who got ban?
<mitamaking> WEll dang
<Invi> Alchemist, with yellow eyes and mane ^^
<CrystalPhoenix> Invi there we go
<Rex_Mundi> Although, if Celestia becomes anormal pony for an Episode and twilght becomes an Alicorn Ruler in the day, and she messess up royally because she cant handle it... it would be entertaining.
<VenHur> Invi: MISSION ACOMPLISHED, DERPY IS SAVED
<sub06905> thelonepony, not sure but a ban has been made
<CrystalPhoenix> NOW I SHIP DERPY WITH BERRY PUNCH
<Alchemist> Invi: but no confirmation of derped eyes.
<Invi> Alchemist, well believe it or not ^^
<CrystalPhoenix> Alchemist, oh come on now
<CountDoofus> Butbutbut... grey coat, blonde mane...
<mitamaking> Rex_Mundi: I would much perfer watching Celestia be a earth pony
<Rex_Mundi> Im still wonder how and Why Berry Punch is there?
<Cynder7> 6Hey ^^
<CountDoofus> Changelings.
<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, travelling buddies
<Alchemist> Did she even have wings?
<mitamaking> That is Derpy
<spyrofan001> whats going on everyone
<TROctavia> Got drunk and wandered off
<pony_743> watching season 3 episode 2 now
<RobotdragonX> i feel like sombra may have been a anakin skywalker of the crystal empire. corrupted by evil and stuff..
<mitamaking> Rex_Mundi: There was cider
<Rex_Mundi> Alchemist: No, Berry Punch is an Earth pony, theres no reason for her to be there... she just IS.
<Ponies47> Bye everypony
<Punkie_Pue> Bye
<CountDoofus> Later Ponies47
<Gekoncze> I'm just programming at the moment
<sub06905> bai Ponies47
<thelonepony> Bye Ponies47 :)
<TROctavia> bye ponies47
<RobotdragonX> bai Ponies47
<Punkie_Pue> We'll miss you!
<VenHur> RobotdragonX: Wait, wait, wait. Corrupted? By evil? ...Oh shit, Twilight must NOT overdose the dark magic!
<TaintedSapphire> nothing here eithe?
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: I was talking about the grey pony they think is Derpy
<RobotdragonX> VenHur oh crap...
<Rex_Mundi> Twilight gets seduced by the dark side.
<spyrofan001> prgogramminng what?
<mitamaking> Rex_Mundi: We can only hope
<mitamaking> In a storyline sense
<sub06905> twilight gets seduced by darth vader?
<RobotdragonX> ^i lold
<thelonepony> ....
<pony_7777> and destroys the jedi using dark magic
<RobotdragonX> the end!
<mitamaking> I mean look at me, I am hoping for continuing stories, a darker outlook, in a show for 5 year old girls
<Rex_Mundi> You guys thing the gates of tartarus would open and let monsters out? As well as whatever big bads might be there.
<VenHur> Inb4 Twilight goes chaotic in an future episode.
<Gekoncze> just some small 3D editor, I have it as my graduation project
<CountDoofus> Though the door showing a character's biggest fear was a nice touch.
<Klumzeedragon> Watch, she absorbs all the evil and ends up bringing in every villian theyve faced so far. :U
<spyrofan001> o thats cool
<mitamaking> CountDoofus: Don't you want to see the other mane 6's
<Cynder7> 6:O
<TROctavia> all this talk about darkness
<RobotdragonX> Klumzeedragon thats the idea ive had FOREVER about the series finale!
<Rex_Mundi> I want to see Celestia talk in the Royal canterlot voice. shit be epic.
<TROctavia> This is what i see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzqaeKTqWCI
<CountDoofus> A Discord/Chrysalis/NMN/Sombra hybrid... By Celestia's beard...
<Stormy> I just got done programming... decided I'm going to put off the rest until later
<mitamaking> TROctavia: That's my favorite game
<Klumzeedragon> RobotdragonX: You know what they say about great minds right?
<Rex_Mundi> How about an epic pony war? War... war never changes...
<Gekoncze> it can do only some basic stuff at the moment, but I'm going to improve it a lot and use it afterwards
<furi> ohai
<RobotdragonX> Klumzeedragon yep
<TROctavia> mitamaking, it's got such a great storyline on top of the great gameplay
<CrystalPhoenix> TROctavia, better video http://youtu.be/MzxQ61b-gOo
<Alchemist> Interesting fact. Tara Strong's birth name is Tara Lyn Charendoff
<Alchemist> I didnt know that.
<RobotdragonX> darkness
<Klumzeedragon> CountDoofus: I don't think Sombra is dead. His horn flew off into unknown area, Im sure he's going to just regenerate.
<RobotdragonX> darkness
<Punkie_Pue> Darkness.
<CountDoofus> Klumzeedragon: Dr. Whooves Style! *does a silly dance*
<Rose`> Revelations
<pony_743> I can see a 2 hour villian throwdown
<Rose`> there was a revelation that i had!
<Rex_Mundi> Im wondering how much pony-like creatures are counted as ponies, are there Unicorn-zebras for instance? Zorses?
<Rose`> champagn with grape wine is delicious
<pony_7777> what do u guys think was the dark book luna held at the end of the premiere
<Klumzeedragon> CountDoofus: Something like that. :P
<CrystalPhoenix> pony_7777, examine the logo carefully
<CountDoofus> pony_7777: Necromancy!
<Klumzeedragon> pony_7777: The royal check book.
<mitamaking> Rex_Mundi: What about Donkys?
<CrystalPhoenix> it has two stars and a swirl
<RobotdragonX> pony_777 "the avengers initiative."
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Rose` what you been up to?
<mitamaking> pony_7777: Something about stars and swirls, where have we heard taht before
<Rex_Mundi> I think Twilight becoming an Alicorn (except if its for like, just 1 episode and then back to normal), would be a shark-jumping moment.
<CountDoofus> The Hulk in Equestria... Ho boy.
<RobotdragonX> ^
<spyrofan001> ok
<CountDoofus> One Fluttershy Stare later: "Ohai Bruce."
<RobotdragonX> mitamaking well that will be an odd episode
<RoseLove`> lace underwear for me
<Klumzeedragon> CountDoofus: "Puny pony."
<RoseLove`> *men
<RoseLove`> wtf?
<alexxm> CountDoofus that can only end well
<CrystalPhoenix> oooooh....
<CrystalPhoenix> carefull everyone
<Alchemist> If they add Starswirl I will be very pleased. I wanted to see more lore in S3, and it might be the case.
<CrystalPhoenix> there are fake screenshot roaming loose
<Rex_Mundi> Id like an episode where the mane6 temporarily change races, Id like to see Twilight become a pegasus, Rainbow Dash dealing with being an Earth pony, and what chaos Pinkie can wrote with a Unicorns horn.
<CountDoofus> alexxm: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8u7px_GzWQ
<VenHur> I can sums up Kingdom Hearts as a whole in one word.
<RobotdragonX> aw boy..

<Zamer> ALL HAIL THE BUFFER GODDESS AND ALL HER BUFFERING BEAUTY
<Wrek> 05i liek them because even if they bring you your views. they present some facts in biased light that makes you think. and on some points they actually are right. i persoanlyl dotn agree with everything they say
<Wrek> 05but beats watching jersey shore
<Rex_Mundi> cowvarkian: Objectivism= Anti-religion, Anti-government, pro-capitalism, anti-charaity
<Spyrorocks> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=4tQZmooQc28#t=1079s
<Cypresswolf> anything beats watching jersey shore
<Rex_Mundi> Cypresswolf: true
<Cynder7> 6I like how the guy crashes and then just picks up his bag and walks off like nothing happened..
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: yeah, I know
<TROctavia> Well
<DerpyMuffins> So basicly Wrek got banned for showing opinions
<Rex_Mundi> Is Jersey shore even still on?
<VenHur> Since the begining of time, mankind had evolved from a cell...Scienctists called it...The Gak.
<Cypresswolf> G3.6 > Jersey Shore
<TROctavia> Honey Boo Boo and Jersey shore are close
<Rex_Mundi> Derpy_Hooves: naw, the episode he showed was about porn
<thelonepony> Rex_Mundi: they cancel it :3
<Wrek> 05so it had some cut shots with tits
<DerpyMuffins> Tab fail
<Deacon> DerpyMuffins or basically, something people were too immature to handle
<Wrek> 05ie jsut aas movie night tends to have
<DerpyMuffins> 141
<Wrek> 05but no matter now
<Zamer> so how long are you banned for Wrek?
<Wrek> 05anotehr 7 days
<DerpyMuffins> Til the 18th
<VenHur> Ah, Jersey Shore (the location, not that horrible abyssmal show), full of arcades, stuffed animals, etc.
<Rex_Mundi> 7 days
<Alchemist> till this sunday right?
<Cypresswolf> I think JS finally got expired or cancelled, I dont care which
<Wrek> 05but yeah
<Afflict> So is that basically the same as dragons den?
<Wrek> 05theres a reason behind there not being as much streams lately
<Spyrorocks> Afflict, yeah
<Rex_Mundi> Did anyone actually like that show? It seams that everyone hated it.
<Spyrorocks> usa version
<TROctavia> what is it?
<Zamer> midterms
<Spyrorocks> theres a canadian dragons den too
<Spyrorocks> and a UK one.
<Cypresswolf> my brother watched it quite a bit
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: if nobody did it wouldnt get this far
<VenHur> Out of all the modderators I've missed, it had to be Silverscreen and DCD.
<Lunac> How does the streaming work?
<Rex_Mundi> Nobody liked this, but it got made. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymKLymvwD2U
<Zamer> we offer a virgin sacrifice to the Buffer Goddess and pray for a streamer
<Lunac> sarifice time!
<Lunac> ;)
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: check the likes vs dislikes. It seems those who watched it mainly liked it.

<Gekoncze> it is also in czech, here it is called DayD
<Lunac> TROctavia it's supernatural law.

<anonymous> oh snap rarty got trolled
<cuddly_kittehs> ahhahaha
<Jageman> having visitors to the crystal empire seems at odds with the the fact that nopony knew anything about it
<RoseCat`> god speed
<anonymous> except for celestia and luna
<cowvarkian> Jageman: well, maybe everyone knew about it 1000+ years ago
<VenHur> Ooh, Shizuka's playing GTA IV.
<cowvarkian> maybe everyone forgot about it
<VenHur> I had a hunch she'll be streaming.
<Jageman> then celestia would have known about the crystal heart
<cowvarkian> Jageman: she gave twilight the task to find it
<Jageman> and told cadence about it
<RoseCat`> im all out of wine
<cowvarkian> Jageman: I dont know, it was contrived enough
<RoseCat`> and this is a problem
<cuddly_kittehs> im losing so hard
<alexxm> is there a stream?
<cowvarkian> Jageman: Maybe she didn't tell cadence
<DerpyMuffins> RoseCat`stop, seriously
<cuddly_kittehs> Wait, question; Aren't the crystal ponies thosands of years old?
<cuddly_kittehs> HAVE THEY NEVER AGED?!?!
<RoseCat`> theyrw made of crystal
<cowvarkian> cuddly_kittehs: yeah, but they're aging stopped for some reason
<anonymous> cowvarkian: she knows about the empire but not evrything about it
<cowvarkian> *their
<DerpyMuffins> RoseCat`another bottle of wine won't solve your problems
<cowvarkian> cuddly_kittehs: they were asleep or something, who knows
<flutterfan99> gak
<cuddly_kittehs> T_T
<Jageman> Why would she risk the lives of the main 6, cadence, shinning armor, and an entire empire to teach twilight a lesson?
<DerpyMuffins> Shizuka stream
<anonymous> cowvarkian: thye have been banished to somewhere

<VenHur> Oh.
<anonymous> lol
<J_E_Smith71> Whoops
<RainbowAsh> So, I wonder if the streamer is a focused, responsible individual who will use as little force to reach his objectives. Or whether he is like me and each mission will include hiding from police to and from the location because of some unneccesarry bloddbath
<Lunac> What GTA has been on before?
