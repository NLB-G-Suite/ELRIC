<semc> there's lots of rooms, but only the main channel has people talking, and no one is on the livestream
<LadyCanary> I've got a lot of junk in my house, and I want to eat healthy, but the junk calls me
<kirzstryfe> 1,3swearing a little is ok, as long as it's not derogatory towards anyone else
<rainbow> oh
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and allcaps is seen as spamming
<semc> and irc doesn't like firefox for some reason

<Dark_Horst> back in my wow days, shinedown was my farming companion
<Kammerjunk> fluttershyfan158: Well, I'm fairly certain Deadmau5 isn't actually named Deadmau5, so it makes sense for Vinyl to have a stage name.
<Phase4> allso i should be going back to my work
<semc> okay. that's weird, but it seems to work
<Pon_Jovi232> CarefulDashie

<ArcherJoe11> I didn't know that and was sad
<Everlasting_Joy> kirzstryfe sorry about that, I posted before I caught your message.
<MahBoi777> Pon_Jovi232: it's gonna be a gud movie
<rainbow> make an acc and send me your acc name so i can send it a friend request
<Pon_Jovi232> Agreed
<Dark_Horst> say wrek, how did you end up on the mouse as a drawing tool anyways?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol, trust me, I've got too much to do without starting up an mmo now ;)
<ofna01> god damn wrek
<ofna01> your a good artist
<vteck9> I am great. I managed to convert one of my real life frieds into a brony. One more for the herd
<Chocolate> i managed to convert my older brother into a brony
<MahBoi777> vteck9: /)
<fluttershyfan158> im gonna cry TT_TT
<rainbow> but this is a sorta chill mmo
<Chocolate> hes my only true friend
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know what this Derpy discussion is about, and dearly, my Frank, I don't damn a give.
<Wrek> 05Dark_Horst, a very agile wrist
<Dashie> I got two people to become part of the herd, but the third failed
<rainbow> you can easily play on the side and make progress
<Everlasting_Joy> Dashie not everyone survives the conversion process.
<Chocolate> @dashie that poor lost soul
<Kammerjunk> Dashie: I've apparently accidentally converted some Russian guy I know over the Internet.
<fluttershyfan158> the herd..sounds like a country band
<Dashie> I was so close though D:
<vteck9> MahBoi /)
<Dashie> kammerjunk: lawl
<Pon_Jovi232> 2 outta 3 aint bad Dashie
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<richfiles> I'm gonna nap for an hour before work, and charge my tablet... Gotta start on Fallout Equestria and Our First Steps one of these days! :$
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe, I've tried to do an mmo casual before, doesn't work for me
<Kammerjunk> Well, it's a 66.66, repeating of course, percentage of success.
<rainbow> wrek can u paste some of these songs to the chat so i can get get them
<Dashie> Pon_jovi232: it was more the fact that the third is my bestest friend and I was so close to converting him, all he neded to do was actually watch the episode like he said he would
<MahBoi777> Kammerjunk: better than nuthin, lol
<Chocolate> im one for one , so i guess i have highest rate?
<Kammerjunk> 'Course.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3just use your instincts on it Morty :p
<richfiles> And I need to DL the ebook version of Dangerous biz... I hear that is mandatory reading.
<KwakLad> I have played so many mmo's before they really have got far too samey now
<Pon_Jovi232> At least you tried
<kirzstryfe> 1,3that too
<rainbow> kwak
<Tarku> What software do you use to draw Wrek
<rainbow> uve played runescape?
<Kammerjunk> Most of the people I got to try watching the show are too close-minded. They've already decided that they don't like the show before they try it.
<Wrek> 05rainbow, jsut sub to my spotify xD
<Wrek> 05illustrator Tarku
<rainbow> i dont think u get it
<KwakLad> thought by NerdCubed's description of strar trek online you dont need to grind thankfully... but star trek is pretty nerdy
<Tarku> thought so :)
<Dashie> kammerjunk: most people are like that because of 1st gen
<MahBoi777> Kammerjunk: my friend was the same way, lol
<Everlasting_Joy> Kammerjunk isn't it sad watching them say "I don't like it!"
<rainbow> this one is really original
<richfiles> Also... Sadness for the :P situation... We wub woo!
<KwakLad> and i have played runescape
<Chocolate> @kammerjunk everyone who has even mentioned it too me is that way
<rainbow> its been around since 202
<rainbow> 2002
<Kammerjunk> Everlasting_Joy: Quite.
<Kammerjunk> Dashie: Yeah, makes sense.
<Dashie> MLP is the only series where first gen is worse than the later gens
<Morty> i think ive got them, im just trying to be careful not to spam known vernacular like darling, awesome, and sugarcube while not competely ignoring them
<rainbow> kwak
<otakon> and then the stream started to crash hard
<rainbow> add me and we'll play?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I tried out star trek when it first came out, wasn't impressed with their release product
<Everlasting_Joy> Dashie you clearly haven't heard of G3.
<otakon> so relaly
<Kammerjunk> I quite like Tennant more than that 9th Doctor.
<KwakLad> i have played rune scape i liked it for a while and then just got bored
<MahBoi777> we're goin down!
<otakon> who IS that pony?
<rainbow> kirz
<Dashie> Everlasting: actually no I haven't :)
<rainbow> its star trek
<Chocolate> dashie i cryed myself to sleep after watching some earlier episodes
<Jim> Tennant is the best doctor in my opinion
<Kammerjunk> G3? What's that?
<Kammerjunk> never heard of it.
<rainbow> of course it will prolly be boring
<Dashie> everlasting: would you care to enlighten me
<Everlasting_Joy> Dashie, look into it. . . with shielded eyes.
<Dashie> Jim: that's an exception
<MahBoi777> Kammerjunk: generations
<sonicrainboomer259> hour to movie night =3
<Dashie> Jim: david tennant will always be best
<KwakLad> hmm STO is free now so i might give it a try, but study, i must, i wanna get into uni this year
<fluttershyfan158> hello?
<Kammerjunk> MahBoi777: Yeah, I know. I just wish I didn't.

<Everlasting_Joy> Dashie, I'll send you this link to this guy's review of all the previous season.

<Chocolate> kammerjunk terrible, just terrible
<richfiles> G3 might be bad... But DO READ "The Third Generation" It's awesome, and explains G3 with Discord! LOL! :P:D
<Dashie> Jim: but technically he wast 1st gen as they had a 10-15 year gap and it became the first series
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the design wasn't bad, but it was extremely repetitive
<NullRadix> *sigh* computer games...

<Derpysparklz> :D cant wait for the next ep!
<Cypresswolf> Fallout New Vegas download time remaining - 13 hrs 34 minutes ^_^
<My> I also have that problem Dashie :(
<Mega> How I do that reply thingy D:
<My> What reply thingy?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> mega it just needs the other persons name in it
<Mega> The thing where it displays a sound too
<[SWAG]thehated5689> it doesent even matter mega
<Mega> Oh
<Mega> Lets see
<Dismo> Mega
<Mega> My Hai
<Mega> Nope
<Mega> :c
<[SWAG]thehated5689> where it mega it is in the sentence
<Dashie> You know what, if it's for a Dashie plushie I will risk my man card!
<Mega> Dismo Hai
<Jim> Mega: when a name is said, it is automaticly highlighted for them
<shutterfly> indeed good sir
<Dismo> THERE :3
<Dashie> Time to splash the cash! >:D
<Chocolate> mega mega mega mega
<karmathewolfie> I'm making my popcorn 49 minutes early.
<Inquisitor> Onts Onts Onts
<Chocolate> and a sound is made
<Jim> wub wub wub
<Chocolate> mega
<My> I don't hear any sound
<Ictiv> Whelp.
<Ictiv> Indeed
<fluttershyfan158> if you had a machine that would make any cartoon,videogame, fictional character real..which pony would u make real?
<EspyLacopa> Vinyl Scratch?
<Mega> You kicked me out :c
<Cypresswolf> Who's that pony?
<alexxm> wait is this dub step
<[SWAG]thehated5689> whelp?
<My> No
<Chocolate> alexxm the worst thing ever
<Derpysparklz> I have seen every episode so far but have never really been much of the community till now. Is there something like a formal joining ceremony???
<Dismo> Mega, Also. You can start typing someones name and press Tab and it makes it the name most similar to what you have so far.
<otakon> brb
<Jim> I would think this is classified as electronic music, not dubstep
<Dashie> fluttershyfan: Rainbow Dash, applejack or fluttershy
<alexxm> no not that i know of
<shutterfly> when i flail my head back and forth in the shower and yell, it sounds exactly like dubstep
<Mega> Dismo: IT WORKS o3o MAGIC!
<Yellowquiet> thats defntly no dubstep
<My> Real dubstep = Coki, Loefah etc. NOT Skrillex
<[SWAG]thehated5689> alexxm dubstep is a genre of music focused on the bass perspective and is under much contreversy
<alexxm> ok
<Derpysparklz> okay cool
<Ictiv> [SWAG]thehated5689: I'm surprised you don't recognize this word
<Dismo> For example Choc+ Tab would make it automaticly ping Chcolate
<Pon_Jovi232> Vinyl?
*String_Shredder dumps Derpysparklz into bucket of his own blood "welcome to the herd"
<Inquisitor> hurk
<Chocolate> if you want to hear REAL dubstep, just go get an MRI

*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord's head.
<Chocolate> DarkMysteriousBat: hello!
<ThunderChaser> Germany: nearly 1 AM !!
<Kammerjunk> I'm assuming a lot of electronics are involved.

<Iggy> 15 minutes until what?
<Dashie> o hai emeraldchocolate
<deathfire365> does this video follow physics or we cant do this irl
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: I'd blame LordCelestia, but I'm scared of him.
<graypaw> Itd be so cool if this was a real machine.
<Cavy> Ah, gotcha. I'm a Tenor 2, Chocolate.
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: Someone probably posted a link to channel somewhere
<Iggy> what did I miss?
<NullRadix> someone posted the regular channel earlier
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> YEASH IT LOOPS!!!!1EFCF CXDFGGD JFC
<Meanwhile> I meant in Bronystate
<NullRadix> *shrug*
<otakon> I'm a baritone
<shutterfly> wow i havent heard this in forever
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Morty> me too otakon
<Kammerjunk> Not a darned clue.
<ScootaChicken> I'm not sure what my vocal range is meant to be O_o;
<Chocolate> EmeraldChocolate: your name includes my name!
<StinkomanFan> Go punch them in the head
<otakon> Iggy: not much stream is just getting ready to start
<Kammerjunk> I blame Seth.
<DinkyHooves> I saw this on ponibooru earlier... http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/f0ad1053c21d819a01cfba2fdc8c9b57/124082%20-%20derpy_hooves%20Ferris_Bueller.jpg
<NullRadix> new bloods in the main channel? only 6?
<Cavy> Yay. Again. Listen at the end part, and you'll hear Dash sings Soprano...Was quite suprised.
<LordCelestia> 0,5>_>
<ScootaChicken> although last time I checked I could go from bass to tenor
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Milord!
<Meanwhile> Why would I punch them in the head.
<NullRadix> when we're posted on EQD like every week?
<otakon> ScootaChicken: I think your a tenor tbh from hearing yoiu.
<Kammerjunk> Fine evening, isn't it?
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> I HAVE SO MANY CHOICES!!!!!!
<Cypresswolf> http://www.ozfoxes.com/fauxpas.htm - Been reading this comic for about 10 years. About retired animal actors & thier misadventures. Today's strip was awesome! ^_^
<DinkyHooves> and now can't help but picture Derpy singing Twist and Shout
<EmeraldChocolate> Chocolate, shall we be buddies?
<ScootaChicken> but I lost my voice something awful a couple weeks ago
<StinkomanFan> maybe
<ScootaChicken> and its not really come back
<Dashie> cavy: I'll make sure to do that
<Meanwhile> It's quarter to midnight. I can't tell if it's fine or not.
<EmeraldChocolate> ohh RubyChoocolate.
<Dashie> otters are awesome though
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yes.. i mean maybe.. no? uhmm
<Ictiv> NullRadix: Well it is possible to eventually run out of possible new bloods
<Chocolate> EmeraldChocolate: for sure
<otakon> Cypresswolf: HAH!
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Shh, we need to appease the Lord.
<Pi> woah
<Cavy> It's strange. You'd think Fluttershy would sing Soprano, to be totally honest.
<Phase4> Cypresswolf: that is awesome
<Spazturtle> Is the stream flashing grey for anyone else?
<Phase4> i heard nyanb
<otakon> did anyone suddenly hear Nyan?
<Phase4> nyan;
<Wrek> 05back with nachos donuts rumncoke
<Pi> noup
<NullRadix> Ictiv: nonsense, we just have to step up assimilation
<DinkyHooves> Fluttershy is a Bass
<Meanwhile> Who?
<EmeraldChocolate> id like the cricket :)
<StinkomanFan> So anyway, Pinkie Pies just lining the wall through the hole in YOUR computer screens!
<otakon> nice\
<Phase4> otakon: yup
<arrowtobroknee> I heard the first few bar of nyan cat
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: HIM. LordCelestia.
<alexxm> yea for me it is
<mooponi> how does one recommend a movie for stream?
<Frequency> I'm fairly certain fluttershy is crazy. As she seems to keep all those animals hostage.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Wrek: I want that now ;A;
<otakon> Spazturtle: enope, try refreshing
<ThunderChaser> this stream is going till 10am for you? Well that's 4pm for me :D I can see the new Episode tomorrow afternoon!
<NullRadix> also, given that we can get THOUSANDS in here for new episodes, and movie night usually caps around 200... we got room
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> Quite ppl Lunas sleepin! this goes 4 you two fluttershy and Dash!
<Ictiv> NullRadix: But what when we assimilated every creature in the universe?

<GarrettBrony> Just cuz
<StinkomanFan> I wanna know, what you are feeling
<pikorar> That ship is so mesmerising.
<Lucid> Something bugs me about the one thing with really long legs. For some reason, something tells me that that's not a good configuration
<JoseDiscordio> cause they aren't ponies
<[SWAG]Haku> seems legit
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Who's to say where Gondor was?

<Space> so they kill a race out of fear?
<nlr_trooper> 'cause internet is dumb
<Phase4> confound my biology, brb
<Trancek> here's what I find weird: in the early parts of the film these aliens are trying to kill Cale straight up
<StinkomanFan> *Spike's
<derpy_pony> this ship is much cooler than any titan could ever be...steal this one
<RainbowcrashNBurn> so...who is the bad guy? humans look like a threat needed to be stopped again
<Ictiv> Most feared people is all of existance, chillaxing in a nebula
<Kurra> D: streamdeath
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<otakon> Beep Boop son
<BEN> ThefunhasbeenDOUBLED: Anastasia is a good movie, but HORRIBLY inacuaret
<Ohfour> The new and improved death star
<RoketLauncha> Sounds about right, Space .
<semc> seriously, what's beeping
<otakon> Beep Boop
<[SWAG]Haku> Santoro
<GarrettBrony> Fluttercry plan a course to gallerfray
<Tovler> This movie to too predictable to need spoiiing

<Dinozar415> Aren't you a little short for a Drej?
<AJIsBestPony> Don't touch my ding-a-ling!
<ThefunhasbeenDOUBLED> That's what makes it so good :P
<derpy_pony> lag
<DeadlyDerp3> She died :(
<semc> i keep looking for pages or my name, but i don't see anything
<ben1994> zaaaap
<[SWAG]Haku> Let watch Doctor Whoo
<pikorar> Take any frame from this movie and it would make an awesome desktop background.
<Dashie> phaseshaps ftw
<[SWAG]Haku> ves
<Ohfour> Space makes beeping noises, didn't you know that?
<NxPaqu> I got yo bitch
<ThefunhasbeenDOUBLED> Looks like they constructed additional Pylons
<Lman2> I've seen enough hentai
<Lucid> That's...cool
<semc>
<DSNesmith> it'd be awesome to live on a planet inside a star nursery
<Dorky> I'm I the only one who thinks that the ship looks like a crown?
<JoseDiscordio> most movies are inacurate
<Pon_Jovi232> wheeeee
<Town_Drunk> have sex for us now puny humans
<Parasprite_Bite> guess not
<IshBestPony> Tovler still no spoiling
<ben1994> lol
<otakon> RainbowcrashNBurn: apparently the Dredge, they wiped out humanity for no apparent reason
<StinkomanFan> Giant Tron-like energy beams
<TOY_PON3> this is sooo messed up
<bigrony> no:'(
<Djambi> I remeber doing a project on the frozen seas of Titan when I was in Highschool. It was awesome.
<DSNesmith> you'd have a nebula for your night sky
<DinkyHooves> MASTER Control
<Dermathil> also I can't stop laughing at the fact that the effing ENERGY BEINGS are afraid of less advanced species. If there's one thing Stargate taught me, it is that ENERGY BEINGS are supposed to be EXTREMELY STRONG and immortal.
<Saikon> WHY DIDNT WE?!
<RoketLauncha> How could this happen.
<sonicrainboomer259> yhis is cool but im here for ponies
<[SWAG]Haku> Set the phasers to HUG

<Midnight_Tempest> snu snu!!!
<Athena> This reminds me of the lost city of atlantis
<Space> they are bad. they are killing us so we don't POSSIBLY become evil
<pinkiepancake> the quickening
<Meanwhile> Oh yeah that's a nice trade off
<otakon> Dermathil: they're thinking ahead
<Lucid> Maybe one day
<DeadlyDerp3> "Space MUSIC!"
<RoketLauncha> Dermathil, this isn't Stargate.
<stallion10123> how much?
<DeadlyDerp3> "Do a dance!"
<graypaw> seems like it hurts
<sonicrainboomer259> he's dieng
<Placebo> pikorar: you're right o.o
<Meanwhile> keep your bleedin' nebula.
<UnFoundBug_> why do we never use hostile energy beings as a batteries?
<derpy_pony> spaaaaace
<zackoroth> and shindlers list
<GarrettBrony> Set phasers to Fun
<pikorar> Naturally.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That ship needs a wipe with an anti-static cloth.
<Colt_of_Personality> Who said the animation was bad?
<StinkomanFan> Equestria's in the afterlife anyway
<Djambi> nice landing
<NxPaqu> dat fall damage
<Parasprite_Bite> its like treasure planet but theyre trying to save the human race, not find treasure
<Town_Drunk> energy beings are afraid of da water
<Ictiv> DSNesmith: Unless you can build a shield. if you HAVE the technology
<DeadlyDerp3> "he has LEARNED"
<Dinozar415> So the Drej are just REALLY paranoid?
<irondaveh> spore voices
<JoseDiscordio> tough love baby

<Hazard3> true
<Ictiv> no
<Dandelo> I've been searching for this movie for, like, ten years.
<Trancek> he needs to if he hasn't already

<sonicrainboomer259> she's a slut.it's na fact!
<pikorar> Someone should do a pony spinoff of everything.
<The_Asian_Brony> lol
<TyeDyeBrony> sudden uninspired romance
<KernelCobb> why are alien races always so diverse? humans at least have the same amount of eyes
<Lucid> The chick looks pretty generic, just sayin'
<GarrettBrony> Sexy scene
<irondaveh> he's thinking of ponies right now, and she has no idea
<Ictiv> I mean if atleast we would vote for Good ones
<otakon> Behemoth1984
<[SWAG]thehated5689> im with meanwhile on that one
<TOY_PON3> DinkyHooves: That is win
<Soupjuice> equestria is blown up? i think not
<DSNesmith> coem on, you know you want to watch it
<Meanwhile> Because horror movies are boss.
<Hazard3> lol
<AJIsBestPony> Everything should be ponified

<The_Asian_Brony> i texted u
<Trancek> do you remember his reason?
<Phase4> inb4 twilight wins and it gets wmc'd

<LunaTheBeloved> If Twilight wins I'll kill myself
<StinkomanFan> Or a Western
<detour> :[ cock blocker
<DSNesmith> last good horror movie we saw was House
<Saikon> It's not a post apocalyptic sci fi movie without a love interest
<Dark_Horst> fuck your romance kale, I'M the shepard here
<Hazard3> I think that Canterlot needs to be glassed by the covenat
<Meanwhile> I think I put Alien down for this week
<Hazard3> covenant
<Lucid> Twilight? Who would vote for that?
<DinkyHooves> She has Twilight's hair
<Tovler> This movie's pacing is eerily similar to The Last Airbender movie.
<Phase4> house was horror?
<DeadlyDerp3> "Thbis is the ICE of TAGReen Hpjhpho"
<Dermathil> Also, WHY DO THEY LET HIM KEEP THE RING
<StinkomanFan> or a Buddy Cop film!
<Lman2> The cordata stanata mocada
<Athena> I know the universe like the palm of my hand
<Colt_of_Personality> probably because it has a big cult following and he likes it to a degree
<DSNesmith> you're no good, you're no good, you're no gooood
<Phase4> it looked like a comedy
<GarrettBrony> Middle finger = Distil falagial meridian

<Parasprite_Bite> this movie is so 90s its still screaming ORANGE SODA!
<Ictiv> and the gangster Romeo
<pikorar> No, it's because of his sexual appeal.
<KernelCobb> sonic rainboom
<zackoroth> maybe the blue guys can see the future and know humans will try to blow up the rest of the universe so they are tryinig to stop that from happening
<herostar> bwoashi
<[SWAG]thehated5689> nvm
