<Judge_Holden> FillyFlam: lawl
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Natalie Portman's parents were extremely worried about the smoking scenes in the film, and before they allowed Natalie agree to appear, they worked out a contract with Luc Besson which had strict mandates as regards the depiction of smoking; there could only be five smoking scenes in the film, Portman would never be seen to inhale or exhale smoke, and [SPOILER]
<VioletGreySha> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: THE FEQU?

<Angel_Umbreon> 13You know I just look up the wiki to help describe them to you, right? xD
<Flutters> oops
<pony_2363> reminds me of my old neightbourhood
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the scene when Stansfield (Gary Oldman) 'interrogates' Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco), Oldman smells the father, and gets extremely physically close to him. According to Badalucco, he had no idea that Oldman was going to smell him, nor that he was going to get as close as he did. Badalucco says that in the film, his look of discomfort during the scene
<MI9000> hits little girls and tells them not to smoke
<Silverscreen> 1,11is completely genuine, as he felt decidedly intimidated by Oldman, and the physical proximity between the two made him very nervous.
<Aponymous> Peace Lilly.

<Ghosties> 04"Stop smoking cigarettes!" I get the feeling that her parents demanded that line be in there

Reno claims that for Léon, the possibility of a physical relationship with Mathilda is not even conceivable, and as
<Silverscreen> 1,11such, during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Mathilda to be emotionally in control of the scenes.

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to Patrice Ledoux, Luc Besson planned Léon as filler. At the time, he had already started working on The Fifth Element, but production was delayed due to Bruce Willis's schedule. Rather than dismiss the production team and lose his creative momentum, Besson wrote Léon. It took him only 30 days to write the script, and the shoot lasted only 90 days.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Ironically, Léon is now generally considered to be a far superior film to The Fifth Element.

<owlicious> Sumi: WHOA!
<FillyFlam> alexxm: Well I didn't say a stink SHOULD be raised about it. Just I'm surprised that one wasen't. Not many people who would complain about such things would make the distinction of "he didn't want it," I don't think.
<Randomnerd> Leon will be very annoyed if you kill his banker.
<IshSexyPony> SunderlandPony89 still the idea is that if not for that he'd do her

<Elondras> LEON is French = FAIL
<Darkts3> Scoot-Scootaloo: IKR

<|Master-Derpy|> dang i need help : i cant get on main chat : #bronystate can sum1 help?
<diddutz> professional/10
<turtlegod98> 9.8/10 because of creepy 14 year old wanting to snog with a grown up.
<Big_Jake-intosh> IshSexyPony: trollface.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> durger: b movie also happens to great!
<Pajaro> 4 pedophiles out of five.
<Dermathil> yes, Scoota. Best Movie Clause.

<Ninjazz> Best Movie Clause? :S
<SayWhat> It got 99 points, but it just missed 1~

<Scootaloo_94> sur wooden
<Doormen> Ah
<Ghosties> 04But I never saw it all the way through
*Meanwhile hugs SaxyPretender.

<durger> Parrt Duex~
<biophr34k> oh yea, gnight everypony
<baka52> Leon 2:Return of the plant
<Meanwhile> Damn straight ScootaChicken.
<JESmith71> Wait the lotto's tonight it says on the main page Lotto June 8th
<MrPoniator_Laptop> What movie next?
<twilight_sprinkle> bye biophr34k
<HiImSpike> g2g evrypony
<d3rb> wmc.....does not apply to this movie
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Night biophr34k.
<SayWhat> See that? I was SWAT 7
<Dermathil> We need to watch more Luc Besson movies.
<twilight_sprinkle> bye HiImSpike
<Renard> Also, symlinks allow for a lot of silly stuff in Linux / Ultrastar. I got Giggle at the Ghostlies in japanese, as an extra, running with a 720p background video, and taking only a mere 30kb extra space on the hard drive
<ZappyTheUnicorn> See ya HiImSpike.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Yeah, but it makes no sense in terms of her character. the entire movie showed she was a complete f*cking psycho shaped by her situation of living in a sh*t family.
<Big_Jake-intosh> ok pizza time be back in a few ^_^
<Darkts3> MrPoniator_Laptop: a rambo parody
<Midnight_Fyre> He made the most of his death
<Renard> Love it
<Calcos323> There really should be a Best Movie Clause
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Its something, Part Deux
<RankWinner> Well, sleepy time now. Nightie night people, it's only 10 past 2 in the morning
<Sumica> 00,10Clean/10
<RyunosukeKnT> MrPoniator_Laptop: I am next, requested by Hot Shots: Part Deux
<IshSexyPony> Matilda to Leon: I'm underage and want to make babies with you
<owlicious> |Master-Derpy|: click on bronystate. You get sent to a side channel by default
<RyunosukeKnT> :)
<Spectrum_Rush> never have i been for creeped out by a little girl before now
<|Master-Derpy|> nope
<Meanwhile> Hot Shots: Part Deux.
<Prick> that plant there...it wont be a tree it probably gunna grow like a fern
<Soupcan> they need to make a movie of plant.
<|Master-Derpy|> thats the prob
<AJ> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=6GggY4TEYbk
<Kandarihu> The lottery is already closed! What gives?
<AJ> oh shit
<SayWhat> Nah but seriously... Q/Potato
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: theres more to her that just craziness
<MrPoniator_Laptop> kk
<|Master-Derpy|> it dont work
<Calcos323> Hot Shots: Part Deux is one of my favorite comedies
<Soupcan> it will be epic
<owlicious> no idea, then
<AJ> wrong link
<turtlegod98> howard the plant
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> Okay, even though I do like Season 1, the animation is a bit "flat" (especially in the background) and the writing, while okay, really isn't at its most polished. I really think Season 2 was an improvement, overall, despite more hit and miss writing.
<Pajaro> it's a copmedy?
<Calcos323> Makes me laugh every time
<ScootaChicken> Dare I say, otakon x Matilda?
<Pajaro> *comedy
<TheLaughingMan> I think, I have a new favourite film. 10/10
<Judge_Holden> So we get a perfect movie, 2 great pony helpings, and a dump truck of Charlie sheen. Today tis truly a good day
<|Master-Derpy|> refreasg=nope
<Soupcan> the adventures of howard the plant
<applewis> what movie is this?
<SunderlandPony89> AJ: STill an awesome link
<SayWhat> Wait! The credits ddidn't say who the plant was? He was a FINE actor!
<sonicdude558> Leon
<RX-78-Grimlock> ScootaChicken: no
<owlicious> try /join bronystate? You're using bronystate.net chat?
<CCCP> AJ: :|
<Ninjazz> Good movie, derpy_pony!
<K_A> Sorry to complain guys, but that's not fair to those of us who work full hours during the week.
<flutterfan2> PART 2 PANTS REVENG
<Dermathil> Applewis: Léon: The Professional.
<Randomnerd> I can hardly wait for tomorrow's lottery
<Svettponny> TheLaughingMan: I have to agree.
<Pajaro> next is a comedy movie?
<K_A> Unless there was notice in advance.
<Sumica> 00,10a vine actor?

<Pale_Horse> Ah, the didtant time before Charlie Sheen completely lost his mind...

<flutterfan2> PONITIME
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> Oh. I don't even LIKE the early season 1. Too dry.
<Darkts3> Like a Virgin lol
<MI9000> i feel really sorry for leon
<Soupcan> plant: the next hitman
<Pajaro> i love bronystate.
<Kandarihu> Why is the lottery already closed? I wanted to squeeze it in at the last minute!
<Judge_Holden> Pale_Horse: "existed"
<|Master-Derpy|> leave all chaannels then get ased to pick a channel : i put #bronystate [# is already there] but just rejects it
<SteveCharb> oh kewl am I just in time for the pony episode?
<Ninjazz> XAX_: Broken again.
<Svettponny> I'm still a little speechless. I can see why the movie is as recognised as it is.
<SayWhat> Plant was hot!
<durger> The Ticket Master. Keep a lookout for Rarity's wonky unicorn horn
<Meanwhile> I want to know why The Matrix trilogy wasn't in the newsletter.
<SunderlandPony89> otakon is best badass french penis
<Dermathil> SteveCharb: you missed one of the best movies ever streamed.
<sagas> Plant is best actor
<Comet> Theres one problem now.........THE CHATS OVER POPULATED
<Pale_Horse> I have a man-crush on plant now.
<Om> The shape of Leons heart, is a sploded shape.
<|Master-Derpy|> nope and im using bronystate.net
<[Dashie]> if he was a cleaner dosnt that make the little girl.... a maid
<sagas> Comet: How so?
<sonicdude558> PONIES
<Dances_With_Discord> Plant will always be in our hearts *Bows Head*
<Soupcan> wheres plant the movie?
<ScootaChicken> Matilda to Leon: Hey, I'm underage, and this is crazy, I'm Natalie Portman, so lets make babies?
<otakon> lol
<Kandarihu> Best Hitplant
<Judge_Holden> Comet: I say we cull the weaker chatters!
<otakon> ScootaChicken: eeyup
<Prick> what about Puppet Master, thats my favorite
<Pajaro> i want an appendage that leads me to gemstones.
<Bjornfot> Hey guys, I finally found a person who has Bacteria Fetish!
<Silverscreen> 1,11Aside from the ending, I thought it was an awesome and well done film. Especially one that only took four months to make.
<DocSane> Honey wagon?
<owlicious> no id
<Bjornfot> http://thetheologianscafe.xanga.com/762379308/half-eaten-sandwich/?page=1&jump=1525455900#1525455900
<sagas> Plant should get his own sequal
<otakon> ScootaChicken: THAT WAS NATALIE PORTMAN!?
<Ninjazz> This movie is brilliant. Everthing down to the music.
<SirGanjalf> Max Playnt
<Dermathil> Comet: far from it. This chat has PLENTY of breathing room. This ain't a pony ep stream.
<owlicious> idea*
<IshSexyPony> otakon aren't you mad that Sunderland keeps calling you a penis
<SteveCharb> Dermathil: just got home from 10 hour work day... feet so tired I'm limping
<SayWhat> sagas: I would have to agree, his emotion... his flare... he was fantastico
<|Master-Derpy|> yh same
<Phase4> |Master-Derpy|, and clicking #bronystate doesnt work?
<Meanwhile> otakon: You're slow as molasses aren't you.
<|Master-Derpy|> no
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Ghosties> 04And now everyone, time for me to grab something to eat
<otakon> IshSexyPony: eh, it's a term of endearmenat at this point
<Ninjazz> Silverscreen: That's amazing! :O
<MI9000> THAT TOOK ONLY 4 MONTHES TO MAKE???
<RanYakumo> Just found out there's a legitimate newspaper called the Hindustan Times.
<Mozdoc> One special effects guy for this entire film? He must've been busy.
<Meanwhile> In fact I think you'd lose to molasses.
<sagas> SayWhat: A true actor. A master of his craft
<Everlasting_Joy> Prince of mash potatos?!
<CCCP> i wish life was a silent movie
<mitamaking> I think the ending shows that Leon is badass that he even saved a broken as hell girl
<IshSexyPony> Bjornfot damn you
<Dermathil> "Chevalier KAMEN" is Kamen rider I think
<ScootaChicken> otakon x molasses
*[Dashie] food is for the weak
<otakon> Meanwhile: first time I've seen this movie in whole(mostly).
<Meanwhile> Come to think of it otakon, I think glaciers advance faster than you.
<Judge_Holden> the plant later went on to play Treebeard and the Rape tree from Evil Dead
<EggWhite> I'm gonna get some milk to eat
<SayWhat> sagas: I know you can't tell this but... he was actually kinda hot
<RX-78-Grimlock> Otakon is still thirsty
<Shamroc> ScootaChicken: bad bad
<turtlegod98> it's 2:14 in the morning.
<RanYakumo> MI9000: Yup. And it was made while another film was stuck in development hell. Ironically, this flim is better remembered than the other one.
<Prick> arnt we speedy for 4 monthes
<otakon> RX-78-Grimlock: nope
<ScootaChicken> Shamroc: I'm such a rebel.
<MI9000> LEON DOSNT SLEEP HEWAITS

<IshSexyPony> otakon Venus as a Boy
<SteveCharb> ahoy thar m'bronies
<Silverscreen> 1,11It took him only 30 days to write the script, and the shoot lasted only 90 days. Ironically, Léon is now generally considered to be a far superior film to The Fifth Element.
<Pajaro> HIPPIIIIIIIIIES
<Ramirez> Let's all go to the lobby...
<Midnight_Fyre> Bjornfot: dafuq?
<DocSane> The other one being the fantastic Fifth Element
<Meanwhile> Species have gone extinct faster than otakon's thought process.
<SunderlandPony89> IshSexyPony: At least I'm calling him badass
*ScootaChicken puts on sunglasses and leather jacket whilst playing a guitar riff
<owlicious> Phase4: |Master-Derpy| oh, the problem is that he is banned from #bronystate
<Pale_Horse> I can imagine Plant leaping through a plate glass window dual-wielding pistols in slow motion as an explosion goes off behind him and doves fly around him in the background...
<SteveCharb> how's everyone doin tonight?
<Judge_Holden> also does the Alien Trilogy start tomorrow?
<Silverscreen> 1,11120 days. 4 months.
<owlicious> look at the ban list
<turtlegod98> good film
<|Master-Derpy|> y?
<Dermathil> Indeed. Even though the 5th element is a GREAT movie.

<owlicious> Phase4: i wish for the day we have a derpy side room

<|Master-Derpy|> er so i havnt even been on jappleack 2 day let along on the whole of this website
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol XAX
<SteveCharb> DocSane: I picked this episode :P
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> ...I don't like this episode. I mean it's OKAY, but it's really not that eventful. I think "Feeling Pinkie Keen" was, for me, when the show picked up, because it went from a freakin' hilarious episode to something really dramatic and exciting, and did it WELL. The notice of everyone's favorite mailpony really sweetened the deal for me.
<Distortion> Trollestia's conception
<AJ> Meanwhile: oh shit.. yea im RPing the aftermath of cupcakes with sarah
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Oh... not of course. The ticket one, eh. Meh.
<CCCP|LURKINGMOFO> Bjornfot: umm lol
<MI9000> THEY DONT HAVE MONTHES!!!!
<Reikim> alexxm: Fairly good. Also I got here just in time for ponies 1, so bonus..
<Judge_Holden> And thus was unintentionally born the concept of Trollestia
<alexxm> so we go from assassins to ponies

<otakon> IshSexyPony: not if I become a mod first and BAN BJORK QUOTES FOUREVER!
<Calcos323> Comet: You aren't alone, man
<Meanwhile> AJ: Who the fuck is Sarah.
<Everlasting_Joy> Boing boing boing :).
<MI9000> DAT SPIKE FACE
<derpy_pony> didn't watch ponies for a while
<Reikim> Twilight hopping is adorable.
<sonicdude558> :P
<Dances_With_Discord> Spikenot amuzed
<Randomnerd> My dear Twilight Sparkle, You need to get laid. Your devoted teacher, Princess Celestia.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Woodenshy|Facebook_a: This episode is rather important, as it sets up 2 other episodes, including the finale.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I'm kind of in the mood for some Transformers now...
<RanYakumo> Look, CONFLICT.
<DocSane> AJ is awfully excited about the gala
<owlicious> that's too unlikely of a coincidence.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> spike isnt a friend hes a man slave
<otakon> Reikim: that's a given
<mitamaking> By the way Applejack gets first dibs on the ticket
<Ninjazz> Dermathil: It's not laziness if it's intentional. :D
<K_A> You know
<AJ> Meanwhile: Inet girlfriend trololo
<Reikim> otakon: You will never be a mod.
<Svettponny> I think the early episodes are good as well, in their own way. There's not denying the whole feel of the show changed over time though.
<Comet> The theme is the girliest part about the show
<otakon> Reikim: says you
<IshSexyPony> take note of my last post SunderlandPony89
*SayWhat noms on Pop Tarts.
<mitamaking> Spike did skip the Gala
<HowToFryChicken> Nice, but do they blend?
<pony_300> Celestia: Has five friends; send two tickets
<kidzrul434> look again the tickets are now diamonds
<AJ> DocSane: yes i am
<Dermathil> Doesn't feel like it is intentional though.
<Mozdoc> Look Twilight, here's the bane of your existance. One ticket for you, and one for one of your five friends.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Silverscreen: whats the other ep
<alexxm> spike is not impressed with your shennigans
<Meanwhile> AJ: Uhhuh. She on here?
<inkBot> wouldn't twilight have known if spike had gone? O.o
<SteveCharb> SunderlandPony89: man if it turned out to be a specific date, bronies would schedule grand galloping gala conventions all over the world
<Reikim> Hey mods! Will otakon ever be a mod on here?
<ScootaChicken> It sounded like she just sed 'glaaaaaad sex!'
<MI9000> I REALLY NEED THIS PONIES
<K_A> I used to find the theme way too poppy for my tastes before I started watch MLP. Now I whistle it to myself. I am way too easily influenced.
<AJ> Meanwhile: not on regulars
<mitamaking> Dat consistancy
<EggWhite> Berry Punch is going to the gala?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Alicorn_Prince_Shane: The one with the GGG dresses.
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> THOSE BACKGROUND PONIES THAT STAND AND BLINK AND DO NOTING
<HowToFryChicken> Irony - only Applejack has a legit good reason to be there.
<Distortion> Fail, rich have snobby tastes
<AJ> Meanwhile: but yea on bronystate
<RaveBrony> inkBot: True.... O.o
<SunderlandPony89> SteveCharb: I want to know what year it is in Equestria. That'd be freakin' interesting
<otakon> dat saggy old hip
<SteveCharb> saggy old hip
<RX-78-Grimlock> Reikim: Otakon will only be french, a penis, and still thirsty.
<K_A> Their farm is always falling apart, I swear.
<IshSexyPony> otakon you'll have to face an...Army of Me
<Meanwhile> AJ: Uhhuh. What's her nick?
<DocSane> Granny Smith looks close to death there.
<Renard> http://i.imgur.com/NuGMF.jpg
<RaveBrony> ^
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Silverscreen: ahhh kk
<Reikim> RX-78-Grimlock: Sounds accurate.

<RaveBrony> Renard: What is that? O.o
<Ninjazz> AND CELESTIA IS NOT A TROLL. She sent those for Spike and Twilight.
<otakon> RD is a SPY?
<Calcos323> fapping
<|Master-Derpy|> wow i wonder who got me banned 4 something i dodnt do
<Svettponny> Dat smile
<SayWhat> Woah, I just noticed an error in the newsletter O_O
<SirGanjalf> busy, nappin
<MI9000> Applejack has the waaaaaay better reason to go
<ScootaChicken> otakon was a mod for like 10 seconds. He was the worst mod ever. Even worse than Saxy.
<turtlegod98> ARE YOU A SPY?
<Mozdoc> Applejack would give up Bucky McGilligudy? Isn't that one of her hindleg names?
<pony_300> Ashleigh Ball overhears Asheleigh Ball talking about the GGG
<AJ> Meanwhile: trololo i think its cacence
<Reikim> otakon: You have no banmallet.
<RaveBrony> Oh RD... =_(\
<ScootaChicken> SaxyPretender: <3
<Darf14> RD can sleep just about anywhere
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> Silverscreen: I actually like Suited for Success. And the early episodes have an odd tone, I don't think it found its niche yet. Not as good as the latter half.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hey
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: 0_o trololol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hey
<RyunosukeKnT> RD = Blue spy
<mitamaking> Sorry Applejack gets first dibs
<otakon> ScootaChicken: I didn't KNOW I was a mod.
<SunderlandPony89> IshSexyPony: xD Troll otakon!
<AJ> LYRA
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's mean
<HowToFryChicken> "Imma friend of Sara Connah"
<Meanwhile> AJ: Cacence hm.

<mitamaking> Ditzy
<Ninjazz> Dat Selfish RD. -__(\
<Pajaro> dat lyra
<SunderlandPony89> I was busy... fapping
<otakon> SaxyPretender: ask him if he's OKAY....
<Pale_Horse> Ohai Derpy.
<SteveCharb> SunderlandPony89: I imagine that having a fo real godhead ruler would technological advance much quicker than on Earth
<ScootaChicken> SaxyPretender: I blame you for everything ^_^
<IshSexyPony> otakon you can't possibly hope to defeat a....Dancer in the Dark
<SirGanjalf> Derpy
<kidzrul434> I AM A BANANA!
<HowToFryChicken> derpy <3
<Derpy_Hooves> ME
<Distortion> No one wants to watch RD in the dead of night
<SirGanjalf> Lyra
<Shamroc> Shiny
<Midnight_Fyre> SunderlandPony89: It is the year 1000, since they started counting dates after Celestia seized total power for herself
<fluttercry> 05,15Shut up RD nobody cares about you
<pony_300> dat STRUT
<Steelninjapony> LYRA
<Reikim> What's mean Saxy?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Hey, ScootaChicken, ARE YOU OKAY
<K_A> Renard: Why you no & that command?
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Ikr.
<alexxm> so she crashes the performance
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> and derpy has underped eyes
<Ninjazz> fluttercry: indeed.
<flutterfan2> HOLD ON twi's brother is a geniral of the roral gards why hasent she been to the gala?
<HowToFryChicken> But what about the T-P0N1?
<RX-78-Grimlock> XD
<Calcos323> No, Rainbow Dash, the cops would throw you out
<sonicdude558> lawl
<RyunosukeKnT> that derpuy
<Svettponny> So awesome it can't be shown on screen.
<ScootaChicken> SaxyPretender: XD
<Steelninjapony> DERPY
<RivaLz> Dat Face Expressions!
<SteveCharb> rd just flashed everypony
<RyunosukeKnT> derpy
<EggWhite> They have spectator seats at the Gala?
<otakon> IshSexyPony: oh God make it stop...........oh wait I don't like Bjork so I have NO idea what you're on about.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Silverscreen: the first time i saw u in Bstate i saw it at Starscream
<AJ> Meanwhile: but right now shes Twi
<Darf14> That RD one hit KO move
<RyunosukeKnT> and lyra
<pony_300> what is buccaneer blaze
<Kandarihu> And at the Gala, she merely gets to meet them... briefly. Then she watches as they ignore her.
<mitamaking> Is it any wonder Twillight was the only pony I didn't hate early on
<HoboAddiction> Plot holes. Plot holes everywhere!
<SayWhat> Buccaneer Blaze... clearly too incredible to be shown on screen
<Randomnerd> Funfact: Soarin is a Lt. Colonel in the RCAF
<MI9000> that for some reason creates a giant explosion?
<JESmith71> Derpy before she was derped on purpose
<kirzstryfe> considering I'm seeing bans for both your current IP and the one that falls under jappleack, I'm inclined to think you know
<ROHKARA> The writers didn't pick up on Derpy until later on
<SteveCharb> the filly flash is NSFTV
<Randomnerd> ...Evidently.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol insert Danger Zone theme
<Soupcan> nope
<Pajaro> a rainbow among thunder
<Silverscreen> 1,11You thought my name was Starscream?

<IshSexyPony> otakon I'm talking about....Human Behavoir
<K_A> This must've been written before the Sonic Rainboom was invented as her greatest move.
<Pale_Horse> I would like to see Derpy get inducted into the Wonderbolts in a future Ep. and have RD get all envious over it. :P
<Meanwhile> AJ: It's Princess_Molestia isn't it.
<SteveCharb> the Filly Flash is NSFTV
<Distortion> Shining armor didn't exist then:$
<XAX> nice spam brah
<Renard> K_A, because I want to this the live log in the terminal (in order to check for any potential media errors)
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol this pony ep is so funny when u play satisfaction in the bg
<otakon> SteveCharb: that WOULD cause a atmospheric disturbance I'm sure.
<AJ> Meanwhile: yes, yes it is
<DocSane> EggWhite: Apparently they do. The Wonderbolts mention that they'd just completed a show.
<turtlegod98> o yeah?
<Om> My mom hates cartoons. But she is watching this with me cuse she is bored :D
<SunderlandPony89> SteveCharb: I'd say that Equestrians have less technology then us. I mean hell, they still have steam trains and whatnot
<otakon> HOFFWRASSLE!
<Pajaro> HOOF WRASTLE
<Reikim> I just had an idea. Maybe Celestia started the Gala the year after the NM incident, in order to help deal with nightmarish memories.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Silverscreen: yesh then i saw it as silver scream then Silverscreen
<K_A> Renard: Oh, it doesn't output to stderr?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> :D "A chance to **** the Wonderbolts!"
<Meanwhile> AJ: Well, good to know your rp habits actually have positive results.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Om: New brony? New brony.
<Darf14> lol
<RivaLz> RD would win...see "Fallweather Friends"
<Svettponny> Ashleigh Ball must feel really confused considering how often she needs to argue with herself. :>
<Dan_> omg how could I miss this!
<kidzrul434> sorry I was just too excited
<RivaLz> xD
<drbrony> Hello, I am sad.
<Distortion> Both fail horribly
<DocSane> Second season had a bad habit of forgetting that these are quadrapeds.

<Yokupony> dat face
<SteveCharb> SunderlandPony89: they have magic, it seems like they have rougly the same level of technology, but their dependence on magic and eco-friendly philosophy have resulted in there being no power grid

<Reikim> otakon: How so?

<ScootaChicken> otakon: It's the only thing she does though, she's Shy. Sure, it's in her name and that's her personality, but then that just shows the writers created a flawed character (and not in the good way).
<sagas> dat stare
<K_A> But Galaga's a pretty cool game, Spike.

<mitamaking> Silverscreen: I prefer what she makes later
<otakon> Wow, Rarity suddenly went lesbian
<sagas> Silverscreen: I can relate
<owlicious> You'll be the belle of the ball, the star of the show, i'll be the pony everypony should know
<otakon> Bronysith: that sucks, good show.
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: People have wild ideas about you :P
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> Can I say that G1 is the second best series behind G4?

<SteveCharb> otakon: ...that wasn't a 2008 democratic primary reference was it?
<ScootaChicken> otakon: I'll agree with that, I just think she's less likeable than the rest of them. Add that to being the least developed, and tada! Fluttershy is worst pony.
<K_A> And then Twilight dies of overeating.
<SayWhat> Woodenshy|Facebook_a: I disagree, I liked G3
<EggWhite> Dem eyes
<SirGanjalf> FOOD
<Randomnerd> Celestia just wanted Twilight to get a date!
<Bronysith> otakon: same thing

<Reikim> ScootaChicken: Please let's not discuss this.
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> I saw the G1 pilot and it was pretty good. Despite the songs being Big Lipped Alligator Moments (save for 1) and the pacing is pretty poor, It's still good. Megan's kinda hot...:s

<DashWithRainbows> geez.
<DocSane> (Seriously, she's the personal protoge of the leader of the land. She can comp them a few tickets.)
<ScootaChicken> RX-78-Grimlock: If you were a lemon, I would put you on my shelf and cherish you like I cherish all my lemons.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Group Hug
<SayWhat> NO SHIT SHERLOCKSHY
<Distortion> Docsane : Best lesson ever

<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> Oh yeah, the endings really seem thrown in. Example: Celestia: "What'd you learn twilight?" Twilight: "I learned about X"! Celestia" Very good Twilight. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. SHE. APPEARS.
<inkBot> that she sends an extra ticket to spike after sending the other 6 supports my hypothesis
<Calcos323> HOW ARE THEY DOING THAT
<Reikim> ...Okay, I'm going to need someone to teach me how to mod.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Blaze
<owlicious> "This piece of paper is a ticket" - Trollestia

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> w8 how is the ticket flying about Aj
<Darf14> aww its over :(
<Reikim> I'm setting up a room so I can move annoying flame wars off of manechat.
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: lol
<owlicious> Spike has a crush on rarity. don't ban me for spoilers
<Crippler> wait....HOW IS AJ HOLDING THAT TICKET?!?!?!
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: IF one listens to the first letter sent, it's formally written and addresses subjects in general, clearly not written or sent by Celestia herself. Hence why only two tickets were sent, as it was a part of a mass invitation list.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Intermission Time!
<sagas> fluttercry: it exists
<Judge_Holden> Dark92Enigma: uhhhh what dat mean?
<otakon> SteveCharb: A little of both I think
