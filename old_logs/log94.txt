<Pegacorn> dat wall
<Barry> sure, you get maybe a minute screentime max right now...
<lyra> barry... );
<SilverMane> You mean she's not? Next you're going to say Trixie isn't part of the Mane 7, Barry
*desertman2 groans at the bad pun
<Combustiblelemons> they're still rioting?
<Barry> only appearing in one episode is not enough to be a "mane" character
<Ghosties> 4Guys
<lyra> i am everywhere
<Barry> Lyra and Bonbon have more luck becoming part of the "mane" 8 than Trixie does
<Ghosties> 4I wanna post the ending credits theme in the main chat
<Sathi> 7and that's how equestria was made.
*Umbreon throws korn at ctr

<ctr> the command is quite obvious
<Sumica> Did't you see the comic?
<RobotPinkie> Mmmm, ponies
<lyra> because why is there a back rest if we arent supposed to use it?
<AllisZero> So
<Barry> Is that just the posture you find most comfortable?
<Pegacorn> Gilda is the ONLY character WORTHY of being deemed the Griffon Francis.
<Sumica> Those backrest are there for a reason so she's gonna use em.
*Umbreon throws waffles at Pattyrick
<SilverMane> The MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE APPROVES OF THIS EPISODE
<Barry> true

<Bjornfot> manstache
<Barry> lol
<InsertCupcake> oh dear Sumica

<interior_gummy> waluigi has best mustache
<Pattyrick> No, it can't be
<Sathi> 7found mojito does that count?
<Pegacorn> MANSTACHE

<[ger]Brony1> I mostache you a question.
<Kosoveon> it's coffee laced with floof
<AllisZero> I love when Twi laughs
<Barry> Nah, Wario has best mustache
<prince-dari> I'll get something to drink then.
<Umbreon> 12it's not true
<Sumica> where is your mind at?
<DragonRage> Waluigi DOES have the best mustache.
<Pattyrick> It must be hot chocolate
<Umbreon> 12it's impossible!
<Combustiblelemons> that's what happens in friendship is magnets sumica
<AllisZero> So we're drinking?
<Pegacorn> I NEED NO MOUSTACHE TO BE AWESOME.
<Dashite> Sathi, it counts more than coke which is all I have.
<DragonRage> It's perfect for twirling.
<AllisZero> Are WE DRINKING?
<[ger]Brony1> And Evil makes it all compleeeete
<Ignaesia> Freddie Mercury has the greatest moustache

<Pegacorn> Trixie sucks so much.
<[ger]Brony1> And suddendly Celestia came down and squashed Snips and Snails under her hooves.
<Combustiblelemons> IMAD pegacorn.
<RobotPinkie> Trixie says it. I believe it. That settles it.
<AllisZero> With her awesome magic
*MirthTinker sniffles a bit, tickled by the feathers *SNEEZE*
<Pegacorn> Not you Sathi.
<Barry> If she gets drunk by drinking every time she sees herself, she's either a lightweight, or the cloning machine went haywire again
<Pattyrick> Aww
<interior_gummy> i can do anything better than you
<Ignaesia> Sumica intentional, she actually does have ability. The moral is about natural skill vs actual skill
<Combustiblelemons> I can't keep up with the drinks
<AllisZero> Can't they find a better word to describe it?
<SilverMane> Huh? Oh sorry Tinkerbelle. Bless you... I was, err, a bit distracted.

<Ignaesia> Trixie is brilliantly written, she actually does try to fight off the ursa where any other character like her would turn coward and run
<Combustiblelemons> 10/10 for dashie
<DragonRage> And this is where Trixie just gets mean-spirited.
<lyra> see right ther ;E

<DragonRage> Pinkie isn't scared. She's confused.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm tired of people complaining that their request didn't get played when it's against the rules.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm going to get pizza. BRB.
<Kosoveon> where you want something really bad but when you get it you get sick of looking at it XD
<SirSprinkles> 6So I'm not playing requests this week.
<FreezeFrame> I doubt it, Brony1
<Pegacorn> Brony1,umad?
<Sumica> Oh I read about that game a bit ago.....I think.
<FreezeFrame> Not all dating sims are Hentai
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll pick up requests probably after LotR.

<[ger]Brony1> I don't know, i am gusta or not
<AllisZero> I'm ok with that
<Bjornfot> Yes, it's gonna have porn.
<Pegacorn> LOTR already?
*EspyLacopa wonders if reverse psychology would work on SirSprinkles
<FreezeFrame> Ah, never mind.
*InsertCupcake is getting into this song
<AllisZero> If you get people to translate the character's personalities accurately
<SirSprinkles> 6Because it's been a while.
<DragonRage> SirSprinkles, you should not play a video wherein Rainbow Dash is awesome, set to the song "Don't Stop Me Now".
<AllisZero> It'll be great success

<FreezeFrame> Brony1: It's been done in real life
<Pegacorn> Ellis is a brony?
<Pegacorn> Cool story bro.
<AllisZero> Indeed. It's even more fun when you're in a position of power of sorts and people aren't allowed to give a shit what you like or not in their respect for you
<FreezeFrame> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_broadcast_signal_intrusion is the coolest example
<EspyLacopa> ....Imagine if you broke into the principal's office of a large school and played this on the intercom.
<EspyLacopa> For the /entire school/
<Combustiblelemons> And that is why we need a brony president/prime minister
<SilverMare> *shaking her head* Tinkerbelle... can we get out of here? Not that i don't love this song, but i don't feel right after... you hit me again.
<EspyLacopa> How many lurking bronies would it lure out?
<Sumica> I did somthing small scale like that at work using the bluetooth enabled projectors in the conference rooms.
<EspyLacopa> Awesome.
<Pegacorn> YOU ARE TEARING TINKERBELLE APART SILVERMARE!

<prince-dari> The point is they acknowledged us, and dedicated something specifically to us. How many fandoms get that. :/
<prince-dari> Not many.
<RainBroDash> 10^
<RainBroDash> 10BUT NIGEL MADE IT BETTER
<SilverMane> ^
<Polarfire> ^
<prince-dari> ...
<Kosoveon> ports don't count for me
<Kosoveon> remakes do :B
<Ziltoid> ^
<SilverMane> dammit RainBroDash
<lightumbreon> 06ima off for bed
<RainBroDash> 10lol. Dem arrows
<RainBroDash> 10WIN
<lightumbreon> 06Gnite all
<Ghosties> 4That may be...I just don't like the song
<RainBroDash> 10I WIN

<Kosoveon> night lu
<interior_gummy> kyrospawn is epic
<Ray> 02Nini~
<Sathi> 7so cute <3
*RainBroDash 10WINs
<DragonRage> My Little Thornberries: Friendship is BLARGHARAGH?
<prince-dari> You guys make me so sad. They gave us something that good, and you like the horrible defaced version better.
<RainBroDash> 10^
<RainBroDash> 10ff
<RainBroDash> 10it's not horrible
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, the Nigel thing hurts my ears
<RainBroDash> 10it's even better
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane go die
<Polarfire> Don't worry dari I didn't like it either
<AllisZero> Fluttershy is adorable even when she's evil
<EdwardNewgate> >implying we all like the "defaced" version better
<Ghosties> 4"horrible" and "defaced" are purely subjective of your opinion. RainBro and I believe Nigel made that song bearable
<Ignaesia> Pinkie's epic laugh
<SilverMane> Mai Waifu, WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?
<interior_gummy> I HAVE AWWIVED
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane I said go die <3 But I didn't mean it
<RainBroDash> 10oh shit, interior_gummy time
<[ger]Brony1> Photo Finish is second-best pony after Trixie
<Ignaesia> DA MAJICKS
<SilverMane> I have half a mind to take this belt off right now. to show you ALL of my <3
<prince-dari> They did deface it.
<prince-dari> >mar, disfigure
<EspyLacopa> ....Heh, Avatar: Friendship is Magic (Avatar the Airbender) pic.
<prince-dari> They changed it beyond recognition
<Ghosties> 4Again, how can you deface something when it's already shit :/
<EspyLacopa> Fluttershy giving the Facestealer Koh the Stare.
<DragonRage> Dari, y'all being kinda melodramatic there.
<RainBroDash> 10No. They made it what it deserved to be. A godly shimmering image of wonderment
<ValtheJean> um...technically Ghosties that means Equestria Girls was shit
<prince-dari> Ghosties, you're missing the meaning of the word if you ask that question. :P
<SilverMane> THE MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE APPROVES OF THIS VIDEO
<FreezeFrame> They gave something to a fandom known for doing such things.
<[ger]Brony1> THE GRRRRRRRRREAT AND POWERRRRFULL TRRRRRRRRRRIXIE!!
<FreezeFrame> They knew what they were doing.
<SilverMane> also, MirthTinker, my little Minx, what say you?
<DragonRage> Guys, guys, guys. The Great and Powerful Trixie.
<mib_hwq3xe> The Great And Powerful Trixie, Eh?
<Sumica> so is this boast busters in a nutshell?
<Polarfire> Valthejean: that's what he means
<Sathi> 7heh
<Sathi> 7yes
<DragonRage> Pretty much, Sumica.
<Ignaesia> yep
<interior_gummy> naked trixie
<Ghosties> 4What I'm implying is that Equestria Girls, to me, is shit. Defacing is implying that you made it bad, and I'm saying how can you make it bad when it's already bad
<desertman2> So what are we doing right now?
<SilverMane> watching random stuff
<FreezeFrame> post-show
<SilverMane> and bitching
*AllisZero grabs pitchfork

<prince-dari> Oh God.

<ValtheJean> EspyLacopa: FUND IT
<[ger]Brony1> Like the First Doctor said in 'Three Doctors': "This is my replacement? A dandy and a clown?" And MS is both in one person.
<RainBroDash> 10EdwardNewgate, I think Matt Smith has brought a great new dynamic to the show, and has made the show accessible to a wider audience
<Sathi> 7eeeeh
<AllisZero> Wohoo~
<prince-dari> Oh God.
<prince-dari> Seriously?
<prince-dari> How fucking...
<prince-dari> God.

<interior_gummy> i'm american, never watched dr whooves
<interior_gummy> *who
<Ignaesia> I agree RainBroDash, I use the same argument as to why the Wii is the best console ever made
<ValtheJean> RainBroDash: eh...I would argue against that. Considering a majority of the world is filled with incestuous idiots
<Ziltoid> dat typo
<prince-dari> LOL Ignaesia.

<interior_gummy> dude, it's only 8 pm where we are
<SilverMane> indeed it is
<prince-dari> It'll probably take you something like 10 minutes to get to where I am SilverMane.
<EdwardNewgate> After watching Dari play, i'm seriously thinking about playing it
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, i grind a little bit; i like maxing skills asap
<SilverMane> what takes you so long is that you read outloud to us
<EdwardNewgate> and with those wonderful accents
<interior_gummy> http://hammeroftruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/michele-bachmann-eating-a-corndog.jpg

<RandomViewerWhoIsntRBD> testing
*Drake throws bricks at Angel_Espeon
<Sathi> 7oh no
<DragonRage> ... best Rick Roll ever.
<desertman2> It's not a rickroll
<mib_oxo5xs> Leet Street boys version is better
*Nick protects Angel_Espeon
<desertman2> We weren't told that it was something else
<SirSprinkles> 6Leet Street Boys are pretty awesome.
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<DragonRage> I actually saw this come up in a topic on ponychan.
*Drake watches as Nick gets pelted with bricks
<Polarfire> suddenly, sprinkles
<Lucid> Pony roll then
<Polarfire> :O
<DragonRage> And yeah, it was a rick roll there.
<DragonRage> My point is
<SirSprinkles> 6But I'm playing this one, so, since it's related to me, it's 20% cooler.
*DragonRage is okay with this.
<shiggy> why are the ads on here considered "malicious" by my AV?
<desertman2> Misleading the viewer is what makes a "roll"
*Sathi 7has adblock
<SirSprinkles> 6...that's wrong.
<SirSprinkles> 6So, so very wrong.
*DragonRage points to his previous comments.
<Sathi> 7oh well..it included ponies
<Sathi> 7all good
<Lucid> Yeah, I'm okay with this as well

<GGgala> Dermathil: >mfw i thought it was 52 minutes
<Nittany_Tiger> I love it when one of the characters flips out.
<Dermathil> isn't it at 9PM EST?
<GGgala> i thought 9:30 Eastern
<Dermathil> >derp then
<GGgala> video has been removed by the user?!
<Shiggyz> i love it when one of the characters says "my little pony"
<Sathi> 7WAT!
<GGgala> >by the user
<GGgala> >not Hasbro?
<Nittany_Tiger> Better than removed by a dick corporation.
<Shiggyz> hasbro is a dick?
<desertman2> or by a troll
<Sumica> dat bass
<Nittany_Tiger> Sry.
<Nittany_Tiger> Most of the stuff I listen to is owned by dick corporations (like WMG, UMG, Sony, EMI, and the like).
<Shiggyz> so...i guess this is a song about how to get rid of trolls?
<Nittany_Tiger> Hope it gets rid of copyright trolls.
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder how much copyright trolling I could get away with.
<Nittany_Tiger> ?
<Shiggyz> none?
<Nittany_Tiger> No. YT bows down to copyright claims w/o question.
<Nittany_Tiger> Due to fear of lawsuits.
<Riders> In honor of tonights presentation: http://2ch.so/mlp/src/1313417880277.jpg

<Riders> FLOOTERSHY!!
<everfreenights> ZE MAGICKS
<Barry> Hallo again
<Dashite> OMG! HELLO BARRY!
<Nittany_Tiger> Dashite speaking dat CW.
<Dashite> I'm speaking what now?
<Nittany_Tiger> Continuous Wave.
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Nittany_Tiger> The amateur radio term for Morse.
<Dashite> Oh
<everfreenights> SPEED DASHER
<Nittany_Tiger> I actually don't know morse, but have an amateur radio license.
<Dashite> I don't know it either.
<Shiggyz> does anyone know morse?
<everfreenights> nope
<Nittany_Tiger> Some hams still use it.
<Shiggyz> morse is just an old wives tale
<Dashite> The extent of my morse code knowledge is ... --- ...
<Nittany_Tiger> Last time I turned my ham radio on, I caught a broadcast in morse.
<Riders> What YTP is this?
<Nittany_Tiger> It wasn't on a frequency range parsed for morse, though.
<desertman2> What's this video called?
<everfreenights> Has anyone else noticed that "the teddybears picnic" sounds eerily familliar to the witches castle theme from banjo kazooie?
<Nittany_Tiger> If there are any ham bronies here, my callsign is K4NTT.
<Shiggyz> lol censored
<Riders> Doug!!
<Sumica> those eyes
<Riders> What is love
<Shiggyz> lol, clicking on random videos?
<Dashite> Love is like, you know, when you meat someone and you don't want to kill them.
<Riders> Shadowbolts of the Damned
<Dashite> Also, Suda51 ponies!?
<AllisZero> So I just got the BEST
<AllisZero> Chinese fortune
<AllisZero> EVER
<Sumica> Feh locked up on me.
<Shiggyz> what?
<everfreenights> what was the fortune?
<AllisZero> "For true love? Send real roses preserved in 24k gold!"
<Shiggyz> lol
<everfreenights> BAHAHAH
<Shiggyz> I once got a fortune cookie that was empty
<everfreenights> thats brilliant
<AllisZero> Me too Shiggyz, it was during my bad-luck-week
<everfreenights> this sounds familliar
<Riders> What A CARTOON!!
<Vaporeon> 12Hi Solistlugia
<everfreenights> THATS IT
<AllisZero> happens every month during crescent moon
<Solistlugia> Hi Vaporeon
<SheenaFox> o3o
<Nittany_Tiger> Ahh.
<everfreenights> ohai removed video
<Nittany_Tiger> That song.
<desertman2> removed by user
<Vaporeon> 12o3o!
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Sheena?
<everfreenights> THIS SCENE
<Wrek> that song, where's it from!?!?!??
<DragonRage> Man, I miss the days when most of what was on Cartoon Network was awesome.
<SheenaFox> Quan?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Do you know how often Aero D. comes on IRC?
<Wrek> cant remember
<Nittany_Tiger> I miss the 90's.
<AllisZero> Oh god
<MirthTinker> Megas XLR
<SheenaFox> Almost never LOL
<everfreenights> 2 stupid dogs...ah the memories
<MirthTinker> wait
<SheenaFox> She actually just left my house
<Shiggyz> dragonrage, when was that?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm.
<Nittany_Tiger> Aren't many good shows on now.
<MirthTinker> I missed the beginning, but Megas XLR was awesome anyway
<Sumica> 2 stupid dogs is back on CN
<Nittany_Tiger> Spongebob is going to crap.
<DragonRage> The 90s, pretty much.
<Sathi> 7that's so cute... but its WROOOOOOOOOOOONG
<Nittany_Tiger> There is some stuff on CN.
<everfreenights> I know! its such a breath of fresh air, OH, and they have classic looney tunes on CN now too
<SheenaFox> The only way to contact her now is probably through me, Roara (thoguh she's busy atm), skype, or fb
<Shiggyz> idk
<SheenaFox> She barely comes on here now
<Riders> 2 names. Gendi Tartokofski and Craig McCracken
<Nittany_Tiger> Nick is all about live-action teen shows with fake singers.
<Sathi> 7we have boomerang here ;)
<[ger]Brony1> Pinkazoid?
<Sathi> 7classic cartoons
<Shiggyz> the new looney tunes kind of sucks
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<everfreenights> but they are also showing classic looney tunes
<Shiggyz> thats cool and stuff
<crono_flash> how is the new thundercats?
<everfreenights> so its not completley bad, although I agree, the new looney tunes show sucks
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Tell Aero to check my scraps on dA for Zexion's Lexicon. :>
<Sumica> I like the league of super evil for the short amount of time it was on CN
<Shiggyz> but idk that new show with bugs and daffy as roommates is really dumb
<ReticentSmolder> think about it this way, current cartoons are marketed to TODAY'S generation of kids, it makes sense that we wouldn't enjoy it as much as the ones that were made for /us/
<everfreenights> I liked it too, shame it was canceled
<Riders> The new Thunder Cats is good, but not as great as it could or should be
<AllisZero> You know that Friendship is Magic appeals to the kids of the 90s when almost every crossover has a 90's theme to it
<Drake> 04Few people in the Cali group ever jump on IRC anymore
<crono_flash> I may watch then Riders
<Nittany_Tiger> The new Looney Toons Show is too grounded in reality.
<Dermathil> Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers!!!!
<everfreenights> league of super evil wasn't half bad
<Sumica> L.O.S.E was funny
<AllisZero> ... there you go, I just proved my point LOL
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Nyeh?
<DragonRage> It's not just the cartoons that were aimed at us, even the older classics were amazing compared to most of today's cartoons.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6More than half do. ovo
<Nittany_Tiger> Instead of all over the place and random like the old cartoons were.
<Drake> 04that's few to me
<Nittany_Tiger> I like random comedy.
<AllisZero> No, I don't disagree.
<crono_flash> LOSE was good, but I still prefer Storm Hawks
<Riders> It needs to relax its pacing a bit but it is fun. I personally thought Symbionic Titan was better though.
<AllisZero> The new cartoons are just stupid funny, not witty funny
<Drake> 04And where's May
<everfreenights> MAD on cartoon network isn't so bad
<Drake> 04She should be on
<Drake> 04And I need to talk to her
<AllisZero> >Swat Kat
<AllisZero> s
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder if MAD TV is still on.
<Sumica> storm hawks was intersting
*DragonRage is still angry about what happened to Swat Kats.
<crono_flash> CN MAD is hit or miss, but its entertaining.
<[ger]Brony1> It's about DAMN time!
*Dashite now has an urge to play Duke Nukem.
<Nittany_Tiger> Sad how DNF met a bad end.
<AllisZero> AHJAHHAA
*crono_flash says Swat Kats was great
<AllisZero> FUCKING PERFECT
*AllisZero agrees
<DragonRage> I keep hearing that DNF was painfully disappointing. =/
<Dermathil> Don't get near it Dashite, it is a trainwreck of doom
<Shiggyz> yup
<[ger]Brony1> Yes, DNF sucked.
<AllisZero> It was
<Nittany_Tiger> I never played the full game, but I did play the demo.
<Dashite> Dermathil, I own the Balls of Steel edition
<Dermathil> a painful, trainwreck of doom.
<AllisZero> I couldn't stand the first level.
<Nittany_Tiger> The demo was nice.
<[ger]Brony1> It would have rocked like TEN YEARS ago.
<Sumica> I like how ZP covered DNF
<Dermathil> I feel your pain then Dashite.
<Vaporeon> 12derp
<Riders> The last truly great cartoon that I was in love with was The Spectacular Spider-Man, and Disney screwed the pooch on that in North America causing its cancellation
<desertman2> It's not just because of the insanly long wait?
<ReticentSmolder> its no surprise DNF did poorly considering it hit so many development stumbles. It was outdated at its conception and struggled to keep up
<Dashite> I feel no pain. :p
<Shiggyz> gearbox wasted their time on that game
<Nittany_Tiger> But the full game looks like soft-core porn, and I'm not a fan of porn.
<Dashite> DNF made money
<Shiggyz> LOLOLOLOL
<Ziltoid> ^
<AllisZero> Just because it's a DN game
<desertman2> Yay!
<Ziltoid> this again
<crono_flash> Pinkie and the Brain!
<everfreenights> robots yet?
<[ger]Brony1> Trashware makes more money than Vaporware.

<DragonRage> >Pokemon battle theme
<Nittany_Tiger> It's why everything is a sequel nowadays.
<Dashite> Pretty much. However now it's back in people's minds and they can make a new Duke game from scratch.

<everfreenights> did anyone else ever find it odd that for being a super advanced race, the Daleks have NO visible way of uprighting themselves if someone tips them over?

<Dashite> No
<Barry> The Simpsons?
<TenthDoctor> 9Ghosties: I'm not streaming just animu though. We also stream Megas. There's also the fact that we don't go Kawaii Desu, and if I will stream anything outside Robots it will be Hokuto No Ken
<Wrek> ^^
<DragonRage> Yer a wizzard, Twilight.
<TenthDoctor> 9then again Kenshiro is as awesome as a Mech
<Ghosties> 4Well

<ctr> Nighty night all
<Dashite> Someone say Pony Obama? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7rf1hJEy91qcqvepo1_500.jpg
<eeverfreenights> and lord of the rings is next week?
<Ghosties> 4@TenthDoctor: DAT OTAKU RANT
<DragonRage> I can't remember how long ago this movie was released.
<Sathi> 7yes
<eeverfreenights> woo!
<TenthDoctor> 9NO GHOSTIES NO
<DragonRage> Wasn't it back during the turn of the century?
<TenthDoctor> 9I hate that word
<Wrek> oh bunbaskets... then ill just go wit ha ponified bill engwall
<crono_flash> Didn't we watch episode 2 of all those series except Megas last week?
<TenthDoctor> 9can't they say Anime Fan or something?
<TenthDoctor> 9Otaku sounds so retarded
<Ghosties> 4u mad bro?
<Ziltoid> lawl
<Riders> Dashite = Surprisingly more tastefull than I would have thought
<TenthDoctor> 9as in, not "has a medical condition retarded"
<Denied_Existence> OH HI
<desertman2> DCD: Will there be robots next week?
<TenthDoctor> 9but "it's idiotic" retarded
<TenthDoctor> 9yes
<Dashite> Wrek, I think you've got me on that one.
<TenthDoctor> 9there will be robots
<TenthDoctor> 9every week
<DragonRage> Whenever I see the word "Otaku" I think "oh taco".
<Denied_Existence> Nobody told me we were streaming today.
<Ghosties> 4Every Saturday
<DragonRage> If I weren't having pizza tonight...
<TenthDoctor> 9Otaku pretty means: "lifeless geek" in Japanese and tends to have very negative connotations
<Ghosties> 4Um
<Ziltoid> Robots all the time
<desertman2> I guess next week I will have to stay up all night
<Denied_Existence> Ghosties WHEN DID YOU CHANGE DAYS!?
<Ghosties> 4We have euro streams every Saturday...?
<Denied_Existence> OH DUH
<interior_gummy> woah, still here?
<Dashite> DAT AD!
<TenthDoctor> 9so it's kind of stupid for people who like Japanese stuff taking a Japanese word which pretty means "psycopathic manchildren" and label themselves as such
<Ziltoid> dem horses
<DragonRage> ... so basically otaku is to japanese what the word "trekkie" means to anyone who isn't a trekkie?
<Denied_Existence> Wow, I am stuuuuuppiddd
<interior_gummy> so, NOW can we do requests? ;D
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, DCD's about to switch over to his stuff
<eeverfreenights> meh, i'll play some minecraft till things start up
<Denied_Existence> What we watching?
<Riders> TenthDoctor = And yet Americans wear it like a badge of honor. What does that say about us
<TenthDoctor> 9DragonRage: only WORSE
<interior_gummy> is this preshow for robots?
<Barry> For those who are wondering, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was releaed as a fil in 2001
<prince-dari> Eugh, friends.
<Barry> film*
<RainBroDash> 10Kawaaii desu ne~>
<prince-dari> One of the most awful programs in existence.

<RainBroDash> 10?*
<Denied_Existence> Also Ghosties, y'all ever going to schedule me an interview?
<prince-dari> Oh God RainBro, don't do that.
<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> :P
<Ziltoid> there goes prince-dari again
<DragonRage> Oh gods, 2001.
<Ziltoid> hating on everthing
<DragonRage> And yet it feels like yesterday.
<Riders> Nice
<interior_gummy> 3so will this be a warn or a kick (experimenting)
<prince-dari> MASTER OF PUPPETS
<prince-dari> YES
<Ziltoid> lawl
<Dermathil> lawl gummy
<interior_gummy> 0twas a kick
<prince-dari> Back when metallica were good..
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> It cut it off.
<prince-dari> GOD DAMN
<Ziltoid> that I can agree with
<desertman2> I see the auto-kick script is still active
<DragonRage> So question: Can we change our names again, or is it just a mod thing?
<Dashite> No name changes.
<desertman2> Just logout
<Denied_Existence> Will SOMEPONY tell me if my email is even still there!?
<StupidSexyDCD> 9you can't unless I set mode to +N
<Dashite> +N is still on.
<StupidSexyDCD> 9so it's better if you just type /quit
<DragonRage> Ah.
<StupidSexyDCD> 9change it
<StupidSexyDCD> 9and get back in
<DragonRage> Not mad, just curious.
<Riders> Quick Internet. Give me Village People ponies
<StupidSexyDCD> 9allow me to explain why
<StupidSexyDCD> 9you see
<Ziltoid> AHHHH
<BlackStar> I love this song :D
<You_cant|U_Mad> You can't because of this:
<StupidSexyDCD> 9if people could change their names here freely
<StupidSexyDCD> 9we'd be getting
<ggfsd> sdfg
<DragonRage> ... ah.
<Denied_Existence> .....
<Dashite> Riders, will this do? http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4616858391_ff2d6a1078.jpg
<DragonRage> Basically, retarded spammers ruin everything.
<THESENOTICESALLTHETIME> 9so yeah, basically it forces that for changing their name
<Denied_Existence> OH GOD
<Polarfire> OK WE GET IT XD
<THESENOTICESALLTHETIME> 9the viewer will have to type /quit

<Denied_Existence> GRAAAAAHHHHHhh
<nickstr> and yet you listen to rap
<RainBroDash> 10I'm a creeper. :D
<drfsupercenter> 03I listen to the RADIO
*Denied_Existence sighs.
*King-Dari 9's Random Trivia: this is the most underrated Gundam series ever. EVER. It came right after Gundam Wing, which, being the (overrated) success it was, made Japan be "over-Gundam'd" and they ignored this show. And yet, it's probably the best Traditional Gundam show
<drfsupercenter> 03where they don't swear :P
<Princess-Dari> 13that you are
<Shosties> 4D_E, I believe you were sent an email with an interview time. Plox check it
<Shosties> 4if not, we'll reschedule
<Shosties> 4it's cool brony
<Princess-Dari> 13exactly
<Shosties> 4we don't hate you
<Sumica> oh right she was yelling
<Shosties> 4we wub woo
<Denied_Existence> Shosties TO YAHOO DOUBLE TIME
*King-Dari 9BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY GUNDAM SERIES WHICH COMPLETELY LACKS EMO. And the only series in which Emo COULD have been more than justified
<Ghosties> 4Denied_Existence, PM
<Denied_Existence> TEN HUT!
<nickstr> still
<nickstr> its crap er rap
<Darken_Skye> Oh hey, NewDCD I tracked down a working Hero Legend torrent if you want it
<mib_oxo5xs> Press R to reload
<drfsupercenter> 03I like it
<drfsupercenter> 03I like the beats, just not necessarily the lyrics LOL
<Princess-Dari> 13suddenly lag
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why I have a huge collection of instrumentals
<Princess-Dari> 13:(
<ReticentSmolder> L2 fps
<King-Dari> 9Jamil Neate: What happens when you fuse Amuro Ray, Bright Noa, and Quattro Bajeena into one character. EPIC AWESOME
<DragonRage> He just realized the downside to using the new Soldier weapon.
<RainBroDash> 10Welp, I've run out of money to fund my large porn obsession
<Shosties> 4HAHAHA
<Riders> Do Space colonies still exist in this continuity?
<RainBroDash> 10Time to drink my own piss.
<desertman2> no
<Princess-Dari> 13ahahaha
<Shosties> 4brilliant
<King-Dari> 9Riders: they do exist
<Wrek> sense, nothign else makes it!
<eeverfreenights> well thats a bit unfair. problems should be solved with robots. not guns
<King-Dari> 9Riders: this is actually pretty much: "What would have happened if a Zeon Expy actually managed to do MULTIPLE Colony Drops in a single swoop"
<RainBroDash> Ohai waifu. <3
*RainBroDash 10is now in teal
<mib_oxo5xs> You are tearing me apart duudes
<Denied_Existence> Oh, welp...shit
<nickstr> stil
<Shosties> 4missed the email?
<nickstr> EWW RAP!
<Shosties> 4tis cool brothaa. I guess you want a new interview time?
<King-Dari> 9JAMIL PUNCH
<Sumica> wow my japanise is getting better I can almost keep up with the story with out reading it now.
<eeverfreenights> then why the hell was she reading their minds?
<Denied_Existence> I guess you DID send me an interview date...I SHALL PROCEED TO SLAP MYSELF REPEATEDLY
<Shosties> 4lel :D
*Denied_Existence slaps himself.
<Riders> King-Dari = But they weren't all dropped. There are still some out there? That means that only Earth is post apocalyptic.
*Denied_Existence slaps himself again...
<Shosties> 4xD
<Shosties> 4<3
<drfsupercenter> 03You don't even like the PokéRap? :P
<King-Dari> 9Riders: still some out there
<eeverfreenights> GIANT ROBOT GUARDS EVERYWHERE
<RainBroDash> 10Stream keeps dropping for me.
*Denied_Existence slaps himself a THIRD time...
<RainBroDash> 10;____________________________________________________________;
<King-Dari> 9hold on guys
<King-Dari> 9restarting the stream
<nickstr> that one is ok
*Denied_Existence bashes his head against the keyboard...
<nickstr> its just the mainstream stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't like ALL rap
<King-Dari> 9we're live again
<King-Dari> 9that should solve it
<drfsupercenter> 03but there's some I do like
<Shosties> 4hey D_E bro
<Ghosties> 4D_E, we'll put you down for another time then
<drfsupercenter> 03Eminem is one of few rap artists I like, really
<Denied_Existence> Oh dammit, now i have qwertyuiop on my face...
<Shosties> 4imma pm you 1 sec
<drfsupercenter> 03and that's for a couple reasons
<drfsupercenter> 031. He's from Detroit which is local to me
<King-Dari> 9pressing play
<drfsupercenter> 032. He actually talks about real stuff, not how high he gets and how many girls he sleeps with
<nickstr> and he curses like a sailor
<drfsupercenter> 03not in the ones I listen to LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I like songs like Mockingbird and When I'm Gone
<ReticentSmolder> so much lag
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<King-Dari> 9everyone else can see it okay?
<desertman2> yes
<eeverfreenights> yeah
<Ziltoid> everything is fine
<roxsnow25> I'm getting lag but I can see it
<mib_oxo5xs> Kill guards to get hired - makes sense
<eeverfreenights> man, must be tough economic times if you have to go through THIS to get a job
<King-Dari> 9well it IS a postapocalyptic wasteland
<Shiggy> derp
<King-Dari> 9it's basically Fallout Meets Gundam Minus the Emo
<RainBroDash> 10Is you're with your waifu, then the stream starts up, and King-Dari is streaming, and someone says "Hey get away from mai waifu", then you ask RainBroDash who it was, and they say it was Ghosties, but Shosties ate Ghosties, THEN WHO WAS STREAM?!
<RainBroDash> Clearly it must have been SirSprinkles.
<eeverfreenights> oooh, gundams in fallout would be awesome!

<Aeroslash> I remember when I first came on here
<Aeroslash> everyone thought I had taken AeroD's name
<Riders> And that's why we love it
<Butterscotch> It turns everything mecha on its head and spins it like a top.
<Aeroslash> it took forever to prove it was a unique name I made up
<SilverMane> MFW ENGLISH
<Kelvin> why do you put it to japanise?
<Ziltoid> Megas is all about"LIL GIANT ROBOTS"
<desertman2> That was english

<Ziltoid> spiderese is best fanfic
<NewDCD> 9because Ena is obviously Maid Fluttershy
<Butterscotch> We have a bot that shamelessly mentions new fanfics every now and then.
<Kelvin> 0spiderses was funny
<Stargazer> dead
<Ziltoid> Prince-dari is a robot
<Butterscotch> Prince-dari is the second best robot.
<Shiggy> 0spiderses is a literary piece of art
<Butterscotch> Best robot is Megas.
<Ziltoid> Only a robot would find Matt Smith unsexy
*Kitten yawns
<Kelvin> 0"an den the spat all of spikes vital fluid bak in den he waz betta den he was best friens with de spiderses"
<ReticentSmolder> agreed, Megas is like a Moeblob of mechs...but awesome
<NewDCD> 9GUYS WE NEED MORE GRAVITY
<prince-dari> Only a blind deaf man could find Matt Smith sexy.
<Shiggy> 0the subtle allusion to 17th century expansionist theory is amazing
<Butterscotch> This is why you build your giant gravity robot out of dark matter.
<Stargazer> best robot is either giant robo or iron giant
<Shiggy> 0its is expertly woven into the very fabric of spiderses
<desertman2> They keep coming up with new weapons every episode
*Dermathil starts to dance in merry joy.
<Ziltoid> that doesnt make any sense

<SilverMane> Prince-Dari? Atheist? With that sexy of a voice? Only a GOD could have given you such a gift
<Shiggy> 0mostly because i feel that organized religion has caused more harm than good

<Butterscotch> I wrapped myself up in bandages because of this robot!
<Sumica> how did he not see that?
<Insane_Lugia> !attack Insane_Lugia Insane_Lugia Rest
<ScriptBot> 12Insane_Lugia uses 12Rest on Insane_Lugia! It's not very effective... Insane_Lugia still has 478 HP left!
<Insane_Lugia> lol screw it
<Insane_Lugia> night
<Shiggy> 0nomnomnomnonmom
<NewDCD> 9Dorothy Hax
<Ziltoid> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Sumica> Gas still dose not work like that
<Ziltoid> HOW IT GET BURNED?
<Ziltoid> HOW IT GET BURNED?
<Stargazer> and batman defeats scarcrow
<NewDCD> 9Schwartzwalt? More like GETTER-2 HEAD
<Ziltoid> Well shit.
<Shiggy> 0robots dont work like that
<NewDCD> 9Giant Robots, duking it out under the city
<Sumica> Compliance
<Armageddon> [14:48:44] 18<Drake> 04when I'm thinking about my stories at night I can always think of the right words to say
<Armageddon> [14:48:55] 18<Drake> 04But when I actually get to writing them they always slip away...
<Armageddon> inorite
<Riders> Dat mellow showtime
<Butterscotch> I just realized.
<Butterscotch> This model city is inside the city.
<Drake> 04ADAMANT
<Drake> 04There
*Drake headslams
<NewDCD> 9DAT PUN
<Shiggy> 0shit, this sounds a lot like the Godzilla music
<NewDCD> 9CITYCEPTION
<Armageddon> XD
<SilverMane> her arms are flapping as she runs. weird
<Butterscotch> Dorothy is racist.
<Lantar> impossiboru
<Sumica> that like one of those you will not rape me mauntras?
<NewDCD> 9also I like the mech design of the enemy robot
<Riders> Action!
<Drake> 04Also question: Would someone be able to walk on a fractured leg?
<prince-dari> Lulz.
<Drake> 04ignoring pain and etc.
<prince-dari> Dat Dynasty Warriors tailer
<Armageddon> Sort of
<Armageddon> it'd hurt like shit
<Butterscotch> It's like a zombie robot.
<Armageddon> and would be very unstable and wobbly
<Drake> 04Perfect
<Drake> 04But I suppose a properly broken leg is out of the question?
<AllisZero> YES
<AllisZero> YES YES YES YES YES
<Sumica> man it's fast
<Stargazer> popeye the mech
*AllisZero twi spams
<Purple`Prose> Just in time for Big O
<AllisZero> I think I found the perfect compliment to my design
<SilverMane> oh NewDCD: Dragons can be Dracos, Diamond Dogs can be Crystal Dog-Fighters, Griffons can be Blade-Hawks
<Lantar> Hunter jump attack
<Butterscotch> Roger, you're destroying the city! Wait, it's just a model. Nevermind.
<Yuzuru> worst case with a broken leg would be a crutch
<Yuzuru> it wouldn't be possible for it to be broken AND walked on
<Purple`Prose> FIRE ZE MISSILES
<Yuzuru> best case..
<Sumica> big bada boom
<Butterscotch> Giant Compression Blast Punches.
<Griggs> .:00:53:52:. <Drake> Also question: Would someone be able to walk on a fractured leg?
<Butterscotch> Head Lasers.
<Butterscotch> Barrages of Missiles.
<SilverMane> lol Sumica, dat 5th Element reference
<SilverMane> i think
<Butterscotch> is there anything Big O can't do?
<Sumica> correct
<Griggs> Bandaging the bone tightly would help a lot
<NewDCD> 9you're missing the Inside-Arms gatlings
<Butterscotch> Those too.
<NewDCD> 9and the hook/anchor chain thing
<Shiggy> 0its needs to be about 20% cooler...
<Drake> 04hmm
<Griggs> Even so, even hairline fractures can render to limb useless sometimes
<Lantar> And hundreds of innocent people are dead or homeless. Nice work Phoenix
<Sumica> the war of the worlds brand lasors too
<Butterscotch> No side
<Griggs> But a properly broken leg would be unable to stand on, because it's just that, broken.
<Drake> 04In this case the character is trying to carry an unconscious person home on his back
*Drake changes it to a large gash on his leg
<Griggs> Just have him drag his leg.
<Drake> 04Keep in mind it's a four-legged character so...
<Yuzuru> 1 leg out of 4 = no problem
<Butterscotch> Man, I could watch this show forever.
<Yuzuru> tbh
<Griggs> Indeed, and a large gash would be more dangerous
<Yuzuru> if it was a front leg then yes
<Yuzuru> but.
<Riders> Enough Mecha worship. Now for the DEMOLITION!!!
<Griggs> A large gash on the back to side of the leg actually, femoral artery.
<NewDCD> 9also what does Du Vont mean, anyways?
<SilverMane> k?
<NewDCD> 9also before Megas I got to shut off the stream for a second
<NewDCD> 9gotta adjust quality
<Ziltoid> Do want
<Riders> Do want in a german accent
<Purple`Prose> Bring...back...my...ghost...
<SilverMane> my god, those titles are delivered perfectly
<Sumica> there is somthing you want to not hear over the phone
<Shiggy> 0got that game booster
<Yuzuru> bcuz bleed out and die
<Drake> 04hmm
<NewDCD> 9back live
<Lantar> Call spirit medium
<Yuzuru> i think thats what you told me
<Griggs> Right, Yuzuru
<Yuzuru> I THINK.
<Griggs> If the femoral artery is wounded, you bleed out in minutes.
<Drake> 04So a fracture on the back hind leg would be fine, although I assume he'd be left with a limp?
<SilverMane> Y7?
<Griggs> Essentially, yes.
<SilverMane> wtf...
<SilverMane> Oh, this show
<Butterscotch> And now, best robot.
<SilverMane> this show never made much sense to me
<Purple`Prose> Dude is so chill
<SilverMane> then again, I never liked mechas
<NewDCD> 9the only show 4chan unanimously loves
<Drake> 04ok awesome
<Drake> 04thanks guys
<Riders> MEGA SLUSH!
<Griggs> Look at it like this, a broken leg means the bone is literally broken, a fractured leg means the bone is literally fractured
<Griggs> It can still be used, but too much strain, and snap.
<Yuzuru> then it becomes broken leg
<Yuzuru> !?
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<NewDCD> 9MY CAR CAN GO INTO SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Drake> 04ah

<Dashite> Vinyl Scratch and Rainbow Dash are tied at 2 apiece for moderator favourite pony and not a single vote for Octavia. Thoughts?
<Dashite> Make that a three way tie with Twilight Sparkle.
<Octavia> Oatmeal! And yeah, me sad. :'(
<Octavia> Everyone knows deep down they luv me. ;)
<Dashite> I'd probably appreciate you more if you didn't remind me of how horribly I did in my music classes. :/
<Octavia> Awww, I'm sorry. Keep practicing! Maybe you can still get the hang of it.
<GGgala> stupid... internet... grah
<Dashite> I haven't played an instrument in 9 years now.
<Octavia> It took me many many years of diligent practice and work to become so good.
<Octavia> Ouch.
<Octavia> Playing is such fun. And can be nice and relaxing too.
<Dashite> I stopped when music was no longer a required class.
<Octavia> Ahh.
<Octavia> I'm talking irl too, since I do play the violin, cello, drums, and DJ a little irl. lol
<Dashite> Heh
<Dashite> I sorta played the flute for 3 years in elementary school because it was the smallest instrument and therefore the easiest to carry home for practice.
<Octavia> I've always just been really musical. I cant remember a time I wasnt drumming on anything I could find.
<Dashite> And of course then I never bother to sign it out.
<Octavia> Ahh, the flute. Nice. I've played the flute a tiny bit, but not enough to be good at it.
<Octavia> I actually didnt evne play instruments much in school. I mostly played outside of school.
<Octavia> Well, I'm out for tonight. Have a goodnight everypony.
<Dashite> Later!
<Polarfire> sleep?
<Polarfire> pfft.
<Polarfire> I'll sleep when I'm dead.

<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I still don't get the tablet hype, but whatever
<Pattyrick> I'll high five you
<Dashite> Once a day
<Polarfire> >_>
<Zoroark> I considered an ipad at one point but this was $200 cheaper I think
<Pattyrick> It's more for convenience, portability, and leisure than it is a full-on computer
<Polarfire> I'm just asking based on something I heard awhile back
<Pattyrick> Do you know any stats?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you get a netbook.
<Zoroark> ?
<Zoroark> Specs?
<Pattyrick> Yeah
<GGgala> what was the something?
<Zoroark> Oh god what I'd this my I RC client id is accidentally itself
<Dashite> That Sprinkles isn't actually human.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm a robot.
<Polarfire> and that he sleeps for about 3 hours, once a week.
<Pattyrick> What? 0__o
<SirSprinkles> 6I sleep like, once every other day usually... like, max.
<SirSprinkles> 6And even then it's only for 4-6 hours.
<Polarfire> wow.
<Zoroark> 7" screen, 1.0 ghz nVidia Tegra CPU,,
<Polarfire> How do you do it?
<Zoroark> uh.
<SirSprinkles> 6Insomnia.
<Polarfire> oh.
<Zoroark> Also mycursor isn'toving right like it should
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, actual insomnia, not the "I live on the internet and have no life" kind.
<SirSprinkles> 6Though I have that too.
<Zoroark> what.
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Polarfire> I understand.
<Zoroark> I also can't see most of my text.
<Polarfire> and lol.
<Dashite> I can pull off that first kind, but I don't think I could do it for any extended period of time.
<Polarfire> Can you function on that little sleep?
<Pattyrick> Does it run Android?
<SirSprinkles> 6When I go to try to sleep, it takes me at the very least two hours.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I've gotten used to it..
<Zoroark> 1GB ram, 8 gb rom with micro SD card slot
<Zoroark> yes
<Pattyrick> Ok
<SirSprinkles> 6Your brain needs 2 hours of a certain level of sleep per day to function properly.
<SirSprinkles> 6I get it all at once when I sleep.
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, I go immediately into it.
<Zoroark> My first Android device.
<Polarfire> hmm, that's interesting.
<SirSprinkles> 6So when I first wake up, I'm a lot more attentive than some people are most of their day.
<Pattyrick> Also, drf, did you read what I said regarding tablets?
<Polarfire> So anything below that, you (as in anyone) are brain-dead pretty much?
<Zoroark> The thing is, I really mostly wanted to try the Android platform more than anything
<SirSprinkles> 6Pretty much.
*Dashite is a zombie if he's forced to get up early
<drfsupercenter> 03yes I did
<Zoroark> which is why I got this tablet
<SirSprinkles> 6It's the type of sleep you get right before you start dreaming.
<SirSprinkles> 6And that's why, Dashite.
<drfsupercenter> 03<Pattyrick> It's more for convenience, portability, and leisure than it is a full-on computer
<drfsupercenter> 03> that's why you get a netbook.
<SirSprinkles> 6You're body's used to getting that type of sleep at that time of day.
<Pattyrick> I'm interested as well, but Android devices aren't quite as readily available as in the US
<NightSeas> 12Back
<Zoroark> I'd much prefer something like an iPod touch but there aren,'t really any android devices like it.
<Pattyrick> Wb GL
<drfsupercenter> 03EW IPOD TOUCH
<Polarfire> So, what are the other 5 hours of sleep for?
<NightSeas> 12Thanks :3
<Polarfire> *6
<Zoroark> I mean that aren't contract phones.
<NightSeas> 12drf
<Polarfire> (based on an 8 hour sleeping schedule)
<SirSprinkles> 6No. Idea. Probably just your brain preparing for it...
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug*
<NightSeas> 12Just look at a iPad and say that to it
<Zoroark> I liked my iPod touch to be honest.
<NightSeas> 12It's not going to care. At all
*Polarfire is going to try that
<SirSprinkles> 6Since, normally your brainwaves go through a few different stages when sleeping, and that last stage before you start dreaming is what you NEED.
<Pattyrick> I like my iPod touch, but iPhone (while a lot more expensive) has some great improvements
<SirSprinkles> 6I highly recommend you don't.
<SirSprinkles> 6Ever.
<Polarfire> awww..... -_-
<SirSprinkles> 6You miss too much and it will FUCK with your mind.
<Pattyrick> 3G capability is probably the biggest advantage
<SirSprinkles> 6People wonder why I'm a little bit nuts.
<SirSprinkles> 6That's why.
<Zoroark> But I can't get a contract phone.
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Polarfire> You don't seem nuts to me? atleast not online.
<NightSeas> 12Every phone has 3G now days XD
<Polarfire> In fact you seem like one of the more sane people here.
<drfsupercenter> 03there's nothing remotely good about an iPhone :|
<Zoroark> no they don't
<Zoroark> mine doesn't
<SirSprinkles> 6That's mostly because I have outlets for the crazy.
<Pattyrick> You should come over here and get an iPhone without one :P
<drfsupercenter> 03some even have 4G :P
<Zoroark> it's a tracfone
<Zoroark> also 4G isn't 4G
<Pattyrick> 4G isn't developed yet
<NightSeas> 12Any phone that is capable of having the internet has 3G
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, but it's faster 3G :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I've learned to control it, since I've been doing it for YEARS.
<Dashite> It's not a sleep schedule you want to try to have. It really gets to you after a little while.
<Zoroark> Nightseas, nope.
<drfsupercenter> 03no./
<Pattyrick> It's available, but not widespread enough for everyone to be able to use it
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, I can't sleep well at all.
<drfsupercenter> 03it may not be true "4G", and I agree that it's just cellphone companies being evil and forcing people to try to upgrade, but it still exists
<drfsupercenter> 03and it is fast
<SirSprinkles> 6The only time I really sleep well is when I CRASH.
<Zoroark> Mine can get on the internet and it doesn't have 3G
<NightSeas> 12Well, if it's a smart phone at least
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, this is my ...fourth? all-nighter this week.
<drfsupercenter> 03>wi-fi
<Zoroark> Mine "firs" under "smart" phone
<SirSprinkles> 6But I function just fine as far as work goes.
<Zoroark> fits*
<NightSeas> 12What OS does it have?
<Zoroark> my phone can't get Wi-Fi
<Dashite> My sleep schedule is completely shot because I tend to stay up way too late which is allowed because I don't really have anything I need to be doing during the day right now.
<Pattyrick> Apple works with developed technologies (although here in Italy even 3G is unreliable xD)
<SirSprinkles> 6As long as you're getting something...
<drfsupercenter> 03Apple is a pile of crap
<Zoroark> Java.
<drfsupercenter> 03they don't even let third party developers have a say
<NightSeas> 12Give it up drf :p
<drfsupercenter> 03why don't you
<Pattyrick> Please
<Polarfire> wow, sprinkles. That's insane, man.
<Zoroark> Depends upon your definition of "smartphone"
<SirSprinkles> 6I know the problems with how I live... =/ I have to take in a lot of B vitamins, it really helps.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, the running joke is I'll be dead before I hit 30, the way I live.
<Polarfire> D:
<SirSprinkles> 6I get no sleep, I chain smoke, I used to drink... a lot.
<NightSeas> 12How old is your phone Zoroark?
<Pattyrick> Yeah drf, let's just agree to disagree and talk about something less arguable :P
<Zoroark> uh, a few months.
<Polarfire> I've never smoked before. Don't really plan to.
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<Zoroark> :V
<Pattyrick> What kind of phone?
<Zoroark> it's a prepaid phone
<Zoroark> LG something.
<Dashite> If anything I think I might be getting too much sleep. It's just way too easy to roll over and go back to sleep in the mornings and I end up more tired after doing so that I would have been if I had just got up in the first place.
<Pattyrick> What carrier?
<NightSeas> 12lol patty XD
<Zoroark> tracfone.
<Pattyrick> Never heard of them
<drfsupercenter> 03I have
<drfsupercenter> 03they're crap
<NightSeas> 12I have, they're pretty good
<Pattyrick> :|
<drfsupercenter> 03Zoroark
<Polarfire> I did that the first half of the summer, then I started getting an averave of about 6-7 a night and I've found that is the ideal amount for me.
<drfsupercenter> 03you should look into VIrgin Mobil,e Prepaid
<Zoroark> Not my decision.
<drfsupercenter> 03I helped my friend out there, you can buy an Android smartphone for $200 and get unlimited talk/text/internet for $25 a month.
<Zoroark> Parents etc.
<Zoroark> Hold on restarting client.
<Pattyrick> I personally prefer simple, prepaid phones to smartphones
<NightSeas> 12lol
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<NightSeas> 12Ever heard of prepaid smartphones?
<drfsupercenter> 03Smartphones are actually really useful
<drfsupercenter> 03prepaid is dumb
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, never stay up more than 60 hours at a time, and I really don't even recommend even 48 to be honest.
<Pattyrick> Brb
<junh1024-XD> like running out of battery quicker!
<NightSeas> 12k
<drfsupercenter> 03with Android, it's possible to hack some stuff and basically get free 3G without actually paying for it.
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Polarfire> so, no 72 hour challenge?
<SirSprinkles> 6I am NEVER staying up the 106 hours again.
<SirSprinkles> 6I will DIE.
<Dashite> Ouch
<Polarfire> I was going to try that next weekend.
<SirSprinkles> 6I hold the ponychan record, last I checked.
<Polarfire> And sprinkles
<Polarfire> Holy fuck!
<Polarfire> 106 hours??
<Dashite> I think the most I've done is around 40 hours.
<SirSprinkles> 6The hallucinations. THE HALLUCINATIONS.
<Zoroark> Okay now I can tell what I'm typing.
<NightSeas> 12Well, Virgin Mobile gives you all the free 3g data you want
<SirSprinkles> 6OH MY GOD THEY WILL HAUNT ME FOREVER.
<Pattyrick> Fault that be ;)
<Pattyrick> Or wait, nvm
<Dashite> That was bad enough. I can't imagine staying up more than twice that.
<SirSprinkles> 6My brain was fried.
<SirSprinkles> 6For like, three days afterwards.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was BAD.
*Polarfire pats Sprinkles
<Zoroark> I do like this tablet though.
<SirSprinkles> 6The hallucinations were just... horrible.
<NightSeas> 12Welcome back Zoroark :3
<Zoroark> Seems nice.
<Zoroark> Thanks.
<Polarfire> I really hate to ask, but its got me wondering. what hallucinations?
<SirSprinkles> 6Especially considering I walk everywhere.
<NightSeas> 12Anything acer is nice
<Pattyrick> I like usefulness of smartphones, but I want a phone as a phone
<Pattyrick> Not a small computer as my phone
<Zoroark> uh
<SirSprinkles> 6You start getting hallucinations as soon as 40 hours, though for some people it takes a bit longer. Mine kicked in at 50, and got worse, and worse.
<Zoroark> huh.
<NightSeas> 12I want a computer that can act as a phone :)
<Pattyrick> Wb Zoroark
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL NightSeas
<drfsupercenter> 03you can do that.]
<NightSeas> 12I know
<SirSprinkles> 6I was talking to an imaginary spider for the last 7 hours.
<Zoroark> what the hell
<drfsupercenter> 03ever heard of those mini PCI express cards that you can put in laptops that give you 3G anywhere?
<drfsupercenter> 03then just use Google Voice.
<Zoroark> my client is reconnecting
<SirSprinkles> 6And I'm not talking a small spider.
<Pattyrick> That being said, they have introduced a lot of technology that makes calling better
<Zoroark> while I'm connected
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm talking a spider the size of a table.
<Zoroark> what is this
<Pattyrick> What client do you use?
<SirSprinkles> 6That much time without sleep will fuck you up.
<Zoroark> AndroIRC.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm still not the same as I was. I'm a bit more, jumpy.
<NightSeas> 12That sounds pretty awesome @drf
<Pattyrick> Hmmm
<Dashite> >talking to a spider the size of a table
<Polarfire> you walk everywhere as in you don't drive?
<Polarfire> like to work and stuff?
<Dashite> "OMG, please don't eat me!"
<Zoroark> I just kind of picked something and went with it
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't drive because my car is broken down.
<Pattyrick> That would be cool drf, but
<SirSprinkles> 6And work isn't that far away.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's like, an hour walk.
<Zoroark> It hasn't messed up like this before...
<Armageddon> oh god not
<Armageddon> -t
<SirSprinkles> 6Which, for the area, is nothing.
<Pattyrick> Perhaps one of the main reasons I prefer tablets to netbooks/laptops is the trackpad and keyboard
<drfsupercenter> 03tablets don't actually have keyboards.
<drfsupercenter> 03and I hate trackpads
<SirSprinkles> 6No, Dashite, I was talking to the spider as in having a conversation... I don't remember what most of it ended up being about.
<drfsupercenter> 03give me a real mouse any day fo the week
<drfsupercenter> 03*of
<Dashite> I think an hour walk in any direction except north east would take me outside of town.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was at the point that I realized I was talking to an imaginary spider that I went FUCK THIS IMMA SLEEP NOW.
<Pattyrick> Tiny, inaccurate trackpad that has to be scrolled a million times to get your mouse where it needs to be
<SirSprinkles> 6And the fact that it took me seven hours to realize that says something.
<Zoroark> I'm probably going to take this thing back and get a new desktop with the money
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you use an ACTUAL MOUSE
<drfsupercenter> 03I know, groundbreaking, right?
<Pattyrick> and tiny keyboards on netbooks
<SirSprinkles> 6brb have to restart comp
<Pattyrick> And what does a mouse require?
<Polarfire> ok
<Pattyrick> Flat, stable surface
<drfsupercenter> 03a USB port, which all netbooks have?
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<drfsupercenter> 03not if you have a laser mouse
<Caaz> greenist.
<Pattyrick> Not always accessible while on the go
<drfsupercenter> 03you can literally use that on the back fo your hand
<drfsupercenter> 03*of
<Armageddon> XD
<Pattyrick> Still, if you don't have a very good surface, a mouse is useless
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<Pattyrick> It's much easier to just tap
<Armageddon> 09,08Hi Caaz, how are you?
<Pattyrick> Or swipe
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually use the surface of my laptop for a mouse LOL
<Zoroark> vhcgfgfdstyuhghui
<Ascendant> 09,08EYERAPE
<Zoroark> berb again
<NightSeas> 12Hi Ascendant XD
<Caaz> feelin like OJ Simpson.
<Caaz> Been accused of a crime, and I'm not sure if I actually did it or not.... but i'ma go with not, cause that's easier
<junh1024-XD> thank ghed inane lugia isn't here, ae?
<Pattyrick> Sure, touchscreen keyboards aren't accurate if your hand isn't perfect
<Armageddon> o_O
<Pattyrick> Or great for that matter
<Pattyrick> But it's convenient
<Pattyrick> Easy
<Caaz> crime would be using all 40kb/s of this connection while my aunt tries to play her stupid game.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03what you should get, then
<junh1024-XD> apart from trackballs which I can't use because my hand shivers,
<drfsupercenter> 03is one of those hybrid netbooks/tablets, where the screen flips around and can be used as a full touch screen
<{SV}Matt> what kind of stupid game?
<junh1024-XD> trackbuttons are the most annoying thing.
<Pattyrick> That would be convenient
<Caaz> uhh. It's like the fairy bubbles game on neopets...
<drfsupercenter> 03they do make them
<drfsupercenter> 03my friend has one
<Caaz> Cept it's not on neopets
<junh1024-XD> these iny quarter-inch thingies on some laptops
<Zoroark> ?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's called a Lenovo Ideapad I think
<Pattyrick> Any recommendations?
<junh1024-XD> they take forever to do anything
<Pattyrick> Ok
<Zoroark> I've basically been using this tablet for all the things I used to use my iPod touch for
<drfsupercenter> 03a method to test a hammer?
<Zoroark> To me it just feels like a bulkier version of a phone, minus the phone
<Pattyrick> You've owned an iPod touch, right drf?
<junh1024-XD> iPod touch is not a method. Smash it on the ground day is a method.
<junh1024-XD> get it right (tm)
<drfsupercenter> 03I've used one, I would never buy one
<Pattyrick> Zoroark, which iPod touch gen so you have?
<drfsupercenter> 03if someone gave me one, I'd either destroy it or sell it
<Zoroark> 1st and 4th
<Pattyrick> Ok
<Armageddon> ew
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not cool with the whole "only one button" thing
<drfsupercenter> 03you know how inconvenient that is?
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, sure, virtual buttons are fine, but when the app FREEZES, you're kinda up the creek without a paddle
<Pattyrick> There are 4 buttons, drf
<drfsupercenter> 03no.
<Zoroark> not particularly
<drfsupercenter> 03there's just the big one
<drfsupercenter> 03volume doesn't count
<Zoroark> top button
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean power?
<Pattyrick> Yes it does, it's a physical button
<Zoroark> power/sleep
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, but if it freezes, those buttons don't do anything
<drfsupercenter> 03and I mean, at least with my phone, I can take the battery out if it freezes that badly.
<Zoroark> hold down both, obtain reset
<Pattyrick> Same with any device
<drfsupercenter> 03no.
<drfsupercenter> 03iPods don't have removable batteries
<Pattyrick> If any device freezes
<drfsupercenter> 03not unless you happen to carry around a set of screwdrivers with you
<Pattyrick> Big deal
<junh1024-XD> HOLD THE POWER BUTTON
<drfsupercenter> 03that doesn't always work
<drfsupercenter> 03I knew someone with an iPhone, that thing froze, and we tried holding down power for like 20 minutes
<junh1024-XD> ipods ensure that will work.
<drfsupercenter> 03nothing happened
<drfsupercenter> 03nope.
<drfsupercenter> 03not if they BREAK
<junh1024-XD> oh?
<drfsupercenter> 03we literally had to sit there and wait for the battery to die.
<Pattyrick> By the time your iPod/Phone/Pad's battery has died, it'll probably need to be upgraded anyways
<junh1024-XD> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, because they totally need to be updated every 6 hours..
<Pattyrick> Ol drf
<drfsupercenter> 03if it freezes, the backlight stays on = no power saving
<junh1024-XD> so does wintrash.
<Pattyrick> Did you know how to properly reset it?
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<drfsupercenter> 03I googled it
<drfsupercenter> 03it didn't work
<junh1024-XD> i don't update anything. unless i have a reason.
<drfsupercenter> 03again, if it BREAKS, all of those steps are USELESS
<Pattyrick> You hold down both power and home button
<drfsupercenter> 03the only 100% guaranteed way is to pull the battery out
<drfsupercenter> 03and since the iPod battery is soldered in, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
<Zoroark> >implying updating every 6 hours isn't a law of technology
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Pattyrick> Did you do the proper way or just the lock button, drf?
<Zoroark> can't type fast
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried everythign
<drfsupercenter> 03all like four methods
<drfsupercenter> 03see, Pattyrick
<Polarfire> longest restart ever.
<drfsupercenter> 03the button combinations aren't actually hardwired in
<NightSeas> 12Anyways, what's up Zoroark? :3
<drfsupercenter> 03so if the OS freezes, it doesn't even know you're pressing the buttons
<Umbreon> !nightseas
*NightSeas puts leash on Umbreon and avoids ownership.
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's USELESS
<Umbreon> 12..
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Zoroark> Not much.
<drfsupercenter> 03You basically have to take the battery out or cut the power off somehow
<Pattyrick> Can you remove Android device batteries?
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes.
<NightSeas> 12Yep
<drfsupercenter> 03At least on all the phones I've seen, I don't know about tablets
<Pattyrick> Tablets, too?
<junh1024-XD> wb zune?
<Zoroark> Not all, but most.
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a battery drawer
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, what Zoroark said.
<drfsupercenter> 03but this is why I do my research before buying things.
<Zoroark> I can't remove mine.
<Zoroark> also
<drfsupercenter> 03all of the Motorola Droids have batteries that can be removed
<Zoroark> this tablet has a total of 3 physical buttons
<Zoroark> and a switch
<drfsupercenter> 03mine has an entire keyboard. LOL
<Pattyrick> I do like the Droid, but I'm not in an area of the world that offers them
<drfsupercenter> 03so that's what, like at least 30 keys? :P
<drfsupercenter> 03Pattyrick, what?
<drfsupercenter> 03you should be able to buy Motorola phones in any European country
<drfsupercenter> 03they're just called different names
<drfsupercenter> 03Motorola Milestone is the European Droid
<Pattyrick> Physical keyboard is good, but smal
<Pattyrick> I haven't seen it at my Vodafone store
<Polarfire> ..... yawn.
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, but it's going to be small even if you use the touchscreen keyboard.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Pattyrick> Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03not being able to buy it at an actual store != it's not available
<drfsupercenter> 03you could probably order it from their website
<GGgala> sleepy?
<Dashite> Wimp!
<Pattyrick> Perhaps I just need to look more carefully
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Polarfire> bed... so comfortable....
<drfsupercenter> 03Vodafone doesn't sell phones online? Lame.
<Polarfire> music... so relaxing....
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03the UK one does
<Pattyrick> Wb Ray
<Polarfire> caffeine.... so.... not working......
<Dashite> What are you listening to?
<drfsupercenter> 03and can't you buy from any EU country without any import taxes?
<Ray> 02Thx :3
<Pattyrick> I haven't looked online
<GGgala> lol. laptop on bed right Polar?
<Polarfire> right now, this:
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.vodafone.co.uk/brands/android/android-range/index.htm
<Polarfire> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpUKVfU3A2E
<drfsupercenter> 03they have lots of them :P
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Edge of The World by Faith No More" -
<Polarfire> yep, laptop on bed.
<Zoroark> What's most annoying about this tablet is that the home "button" isn't a button.
<GGgala> eeyup same here
<Pattyrick> Btw, I'm not super ultra mega interested in it
<Polarfire> soooo comfortable......
<NightSeas> 12It's a hot key? I think that's pretty awesome tbh
<Pattyrick> That's one thing about some Android tablets
<Zoroark> uh?
<drfsupercenter> 03well, on my Droid, the buttons are attached to the screen, but they respond on their own
<drfsupercenter> 03like even if the app freezes, it seems to work XD
<Zoroark> it's a capacitive "button"
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03and the slide-out keyboard has a search button and a menu button
<drfsupercenter> 03no home, thoughl.
<drfsupercenter> 03-l
<drfsupercenter> 03oh, it also has the back button
<Dashite> Listening to this right now http://theophany-rmx.bandcamp.com/album/crystal-flash-ep
<NightSeas> 12[02:22] <Zoroark> it's a capacitive "button" <-- Pretty much the same thing
<GGgala> oh hey, Steven_Magnet's back! I didn't notice that.
<Zoroark> Which annoys me because I expect some kind of tactile response, like my phone or the iPhone.
<drfsupercenter> 03tactile meaning what, it vibrates?
<drfsupercenter> 03as my phone does that.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's an option that you can turn on and off.
<Polarfire> sleepy time for Polarfire. night bros
<Zoroark> As in I can feel where it is
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<GGgala> night Polarfire
<drfsupercenter> 03well it lights up
<Pattyrick> Bbl, breakfast
<drfsupercenter> 03so unless you lose your eyesight
<drfsupercenter> 03you should know where it is
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, I admit. Nothing is perfect
<drfsupercenter> 03my phone isn't either
<Zoroark> It lights up after I find it lopl
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I'm looking into new phones
<NightSeas> 12You'll get used to it XD
<drfsupercenter> 03mine lights up as long as the backlight is on
<Zoroark> I have literally searched for it
<Zoroark> mine doesn't
<drfsupercenter> 03and the nice thing about having a keyboard
<drfsupercenter> 03is you can just flip the keyboard out and back in to activate the backlight
<NightSeas> 12drf, you should make your own brand called dUrf
*NightSeas RUNS
<drfsupercenter> 03No.
<Ray> 02bbl
<Ray> 02=w=
<drfsupercenter> 03but I HAVE seen ANdroid phones with the four physical buttons
<NightSeas> 12Yeah, I have too
<drfsupercenter> 03the nice thing about Android is that basically every Android device ever has the four buttons
<drfsupercenter> 03opposed to just one that iPhone has
<drfsupercenter> 03because yes, power and volume are separate
<drfsupercenter> 03I have seen some without back buttons, but they always have home/menu/search
<drfsupercenter> 03even tablets
<drfsupercenter> 03they're hotwired into the OS
<drfsupercenter> 03or hard-wired, whatever you want to call it
<NightSeas> 12What do you think of this phone? http://www.virginmobileusa.com/cell-phones/motorola-triumph-phone.jsp
<NightSeas> 12I'
<NightSeas> 12I've been thinking about buying one myself XD
*drfsupercenter waits for the site to load
<drfsupercenter> 03my Internet is being dumb right now
<NightSeas> 12lol
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah that looks good, besides the lack of a physical keyboard
<NightSeas> 12Yeah, that's how virginmobile.com is :|
<drfsupercenter> 03I'md ebating between the Droid 3 and some 4G phone :/
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<NightSeas> 12Is the 4G phone the Epic, or another motorola?
<drfsupercenter> 03sadly, the Epic isn't available on Verizon
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the dilemma, none of the Verizon 4G phones have keyboards :/
<NightSeas> 12Too bad lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I was thinking like the HTC Thunderbolt or something
<NightSeas> 12HTC makes some pretty powerful phones
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<NightSeas> 12Lol I borrowed my brothers android, and I’ve been wanting one ever since :|
<NightSeas> 12It’s a Samsung intercept
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, that's what my friend has
<NightSeas> 12I was mad though, he won't let be download Android IRC :/

<Dermathil> maybe, RP. But addiction means modifications in the way the brain is wired together.
<Dermathil> That's what they mean.
*Dermathil jumps back to the Space Marine demo
<Pegacorn> My brain is wired so that i have to play video games so i wont get too bored.
<RobotPinkie> That's a semantic argument which ignores every definition but one.
<RobotPinkie> It's exaggerated and distorted in the media, but I have a friend who has a serious problem with gaming addiction.

<Pegacorn> CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES.
<Nittany_Tiger> Advice: Should I pre-order Dead Island as a digital or retail copy?
<Pegacorn> Steam.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not a fan of digital.
<RobotPinkie> PS3
<Nittany_Tiger> I like having a physical copy.
<Nittany_Tiger> Problem is, DRM.
<Pegacorn> inb4 me making a random pop culture reference
<RobotPinkie> Myeah, I prefer having a physical copy, too.
<Pegacorn> Me too
<RobotPinkie> or well, I prefer both, I guess, if I get it for the same price...
<RobotPinkie> Wish more games did that.
<FreezeFrame> That's why I mostly get steam games
<FreezeFrame> The only DRM is Steam itself
<Nittany_Tiger> I really don't like gaming today (PC gaming more) as publishers are putting more restrictions on it and taking control of games away from end users.
<Nittany_Tiger> FreezeFrame, that's not always true.
<FreezeFrame> Need to find a AA battery before I can really play anything
<Nittany_Tiger> Steam games can have extra DRM.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ex: Ubisoft games.
<Nittany_Tiger> Even the Steam games had the always-on DRM.
<Nittany_Tiger> There are some others.
<RobotPinkie> That's true... and really obnoxious of Ubisoft, btw.
<Pegacorn> Cool story bro.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft is stupid. Money does that to you.
<Pegacorn> True
<RobotPinkie> And that's also why I'll never buy their games on PC...
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't buy their games at all.
<Nittany_Tiger> I refuse to support a company that supports such a ridiculous measure
<Nittany_Tiger> And if I was ever gifted an Ubisoft game on PC, I'm cracking the DRM out.
<RobotPinkie> Eh, no extra DRM on my PS3 games. I mean I know there's DRM, but nothing that keeps me from playing my own game.
<Nittany_Tiger> Capcom uses always-on DRM on their PS3 digital titles.
<Nittany_Tiger> In fact, I think a few do.
<RobotPinkie> That's true, some PSN and XBLA games have that, even from other publishers.
<Nittany_Tiger> I really don't like consoles anymore after Sony exercised their rite to remove a console feature.
<RobotPinkie> Linux, you mean?
<RobotPinkie> or "Other OS"
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Barry> Hi, all
<RobotPinkie> Yeah that sucked, true
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't update my PS3 for months until it was stolen.
<RobotPinkie> Also sucks with no backwards compatibility.
<Nittany_Tiger> Granted, OtherOS wasn't great, but it was there, and it was unfair to strip it away as a lazy tactic to deal with an undisclosed "security concern."
<Nittany_Tiger> Older PS3s have BC.
<Nittany_Tiger> Mine does.
<RobotPinkie> Well, not here.
<Nittany_Tiger> Newer ones don't.
<Nittany_Tiger> It was stripped for cost.
<Insane_Lugia> hello everybody :)
<RobotPinkie> I know that, but from what I hear it wasn't available here at all.
<Nittany_Tiger> Hmm.
<RobotPinkie> Not that it matters, I have a Slim, so I wouldn't have it anyway :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Blame Sony.
<Nick> hey insano
<Lightumbreon> 06ohai Insane_Lugia
<RobotPinkie> And not that it matters yet again, because I really don't want shitty slowed down PAL versions of games :P
<FreezeFrame> I need to get around to finishing negotiating a trade with a friend who has a BC one.
<RobotPinkie> I'll just have to buy an American PS2
<FreezeFrame> He needs to ditch his because the only output that works is HDMI and he doesn't have an HD set
<Nittany_Tiger> You can fix that.
<FreezeFrame> I figure I can trade him mine so he can fix the yellow light.
<FreezeFrame> Nittany: No, this is an actual problem. A friend of ours has the death touch for computers... and he touched it.
<Nittany_Tiger> Has he tried resetting his console to factory default?
<FreezeFrame> Nope, but I'm not going to remind him :D
<FreezeFrame> I really don't want to do a solder reflow.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's actually just holding a button down.
<FreezeFrame> No, I meant on mine.
<FreezeFrame> I know how to do a factory reset.
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh ok.

<Insane_Lugia> it's not that i have "no reason" to leave. it's more the fact i've already made a bad name for my-self. so ijust simply xclude my self from the group due to past behaveours. this wouldn't be the first group i get up and leave.
<Insane_Lugia> this was fluttershys reason =\
<Barry> Yeah, what's wrong?
<AllisZero> For about 6 weeks before and 1-2 after my birthday everything just about sucks
<Nick> yeah, but why he still felt reason to leave the forum cos of chat puzzles me.
<Barry> hmm
<Barry> Know the feeling
<Skylands> 10Dunno
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<Barry> However, for me it's been two years
<AllisZero> Know that time of the year you think back on your life and regret some decisions you've made?
<Barry> Oh, yeah!
<AllisZero> And worry about what'll be of the future? Yeah, it's that time
<Barry> definitely
<RobotPinkie> Myeah.
<Skylands> 10That was almost 2 weeks ago
<Nittany_Tiger> That's like a lot more than one time per year.
<Skylands> 10August 11
<Insane_Lugia> could of had the decency to add me elsewhere >.<
<AllisZero> For me it's every year, so at least I've got some ponies to obsess over and take my mind away from it
<RobotPinkie> Just came out of a period like that, it sucks, man.
<Barry> If he only gets that feeling once a year, he should feel lucky
<AllisZero> Oh, naw, it happens more often, trust me
<Barry> hmm
<Nittany_Tiger> I've been like that a lot these past few days.
<RobotPinkie> Ponies helped me a lot towards the end of it
<AllisZero> But before my birthday, it's just a constant six weeks of fuuuu
<Pegacorn> TO MA TOES
<Nittany_Tiger> Last month, I was in financial trouble. This month, I'm in a worse kind of trouble.
<Pegacorn> TO MA TOES
<RobotPinkie> Glad you found ponies, too, at least
<AllisZero> I guess I missed being part of a community of sorts too, so I wub you guys
<Nittany_Tiger> Well welcome back.
<AllisZero> Nittany_Tiger: I know how it is, it's either one or the other around these parts
<Pegacorn> G4 Ponies are the only ponies worth existing.
<Nittany_Tiger> All that extra money I made on this job, I'd really would give it all back right now.
<AllisZero> Crappy job?
<AllisZero> Well, I guess that's kinda obvious
<Nittany_Tiger> The job was ok.
<Skylands> 10lolhisbirthdayistoday
<SirSprinkles> 6DO THE PRETTY GIRL ROCK
<Nittany_Tiger> It was the surprises of the third week.
<Nittany_Tiger> Constant overtime, then weekend work.
<Insane_Lugia> sky
<Insane_Lugia> go view his profile
*RobotPinkie licks the sprinkles off SirSprinkles
<Nittany_Tiger> I collapsed under the stress.
<Skylands> 10Huh?
<Insane_Lugia> funny ushould say that cuz i just posted a birthday cake on his profile
<AllisZero> Oh wow, that just blows
<RobotPinkie> Now you shall simply be known as "Sir"
<Nittany_Tiger> Really fucked up in that department.
<Insane_Lugia> oh manlyguy's? >.<
<Pegacorn> OHGOD ROBOTPINKIE.
<Espeon> 06Well kinda hard when he deleted his profile
<Skylands> 10His profile should be gone if he deleted his account
<Skylands> 10yeah
<Nittany_Tiger> It was a simple job, but I didn't like being told that I had to work more and more.
*Nick throws his PC Lugia plush at Insane_Lugia
<AllisZero> Are they at least paying overtime?
<RobotPinkie> Ergh, I hate when the plan changes drastically at work.
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> 26 hours of overtime earned over 8 days.
<AllisZero> Yeah, that totally blows
<Nittany_Tiger> $14.25/hour overtime
*Insane_Lugia hugs the lugia plush and feels like crying
<Nittany_Tiger> But I hated all the work.
<Insane_Lugia> well last week or so i been posting birthday cakes on everybodys profile
<Nittany_Tiger> And broke down under the stress of not liking it, so I'm dealing with that now.
<Nittany_Tiger> I should have quit earlier.
<Barry> Hi Sirsprinkles
<Nittany_Tiger> But I didn't want to have a bad mark for quitting a job because I couldn't handle it.
*Pegacorn charges towards RobotPinkie and smashes him into the ground
<Nittany_Tiger> By the way, I didn't quit at all. The job tenure just ended.
<Pegacorn> ARGH
<AllisZero> Can't say I know the feeling; I'm on my first job right now and have yet to come across a situation like that
<Pegacorn> I'M A KARMA CHARGER
<Nittany_Tiger> I hope you never do.
*RobotPinkie eats the corn off of the cob that is Pegacorn
<Pegacorn> ?
<AllisZero> But if you can afford to quit, and have other job prospects, then it might be a good idea to look for something else?
<RobotPinkie> You shall now be known simply as "Pega"
<Pegacorn> OHMAHGAWD.
<AllisZero> Lol @ RobotPinkie
*Dermathil is watching the Intel Extreme masters League of Legends finals
<Nick> whats wrong Insane?
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't need a job anymore. I'm still in school and get paid for TA duties, but that runs out this Fall.
<Pegacorn> OOOOOH MAH GAWD.THE F*** IS WRONG WITH YOU?!
<Insane_Lugia> im just upset how i just barely make friends with somebody and they up and leave. it hurts.
<RobotPinkie> I'm just hungry, that's all.
<Nittany_Tiger> Over the summer, I didn't have the job and ran out of money to pay my monthly rent in July.
<Insane_Lugia> i know im still new and all but its the princeable
<AllisZero> I'm naturally a negative person so what I say may be biased by that, but
<Nittany_Tiger> So I applied to a few places and hoped for the best.
<Pegacorn> HERE'S SOME FOOD THEN.
<Nick> hmm well chances are the users might have the same username elsewhere so I dunno maybe google search them?
*Pegacorn throws a dead Hunter at RobotPinkie
<Nick> or try DA, that's usually a good place
<Skylands> 10http://flashmagnanimous.deviantart.com/
<AllisZero> If there's one thing I learned is that life sucks too much to be bound by a crappy job
*RobotPinkie brandishes hacksaw
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Pegacorn> OHGAWD
<Pegacorn> ROBOTPINKEMENA IS BACK!
<Skylands> 10He mentioned having a Steam account too, but I'm not very familiar with that site so I couldn't help you there
<Insane_Lugia> i dont have a a account. i never made 1 because inever had any friends on it nor had a reason to make one =\
<Nittany_Tiger> But sometimes you have no way out. This is how I felt that overtime week.
<Nittany_Tiger> I did have a way out, though.
<Nittany_Tiger> Just didn't take it.
<Insane_Lugia> james had me make a steam account to talk to him via instant but he never messaged me and the lack of instructions didnt help either
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't need the money anymore like I did before.
<Insane_Lugia> plus james profile is private so i couldnt medg him
<Nittany_Tiger> But I didn't quit out of pride.
<AllisZero> If you have some pride in you and don't want to let people down (including yourself which is usually added unknowingly), then it becomes hard to make that decision
<Nittany_Tiger> Exactly.
<Pegacorn> DON'T DO IT ROBOTPINKIE!
<Nick> well you have some drawings Insane, why not make a DA account? lots of us here have one :3
<AllisZero> I went through that when my internship turned into a full-time job, except for about 40% less than the average for someone in my position
<RobotPinkie> Do what?
<Pegacorn> OHGODNO
<Insane_Lugia> because Insane spyro did them drawings for me an sent them to me in the mail. spyro has a da account an has already uploaded them.

<Pegacorn> SHE'S BACK
<AllisZero> I actually enjoy my job
<Nittany_Tiger> I enjoy school.
<RobotPinkamena> DO IT! It's in your blood, and it will never go away for as long as you live.
<Nittany_Tiger> I had a lot of stress going through grad school, but I put up with it for the love of school.
<RobotPinkie> Hmmm...
<Pegacorn> AH!Just try!I'm invincible!
<Nittany_Tiger> Instead of the pride of not wanting to be a quitter.
<AllisZero> I see. Can't say I hated college either, but I wanted to get some work experience after I graduated
<AllisZero> 23 and no work experience just felt laughable to me, even if I thought I'd NEVER blend well in a social activity like... working
*RobotPinkamena offers Pegacorn some delicious looking muffins. "These aren't at ALL like my cupcakes, I promise"
<Pegacorn> Meh,ok.
<RobotPinkie> Don't do it!
<AllisZero> Don't do it!
<AllisZero> Whoa, muffinmind
<RobotPinkie> You know what she's like!
<Pegacorn> If it's a trick,i'll get Batman to kick her flank.
<RobotPinkie> herdmuffin
*Pegacorn eats the muffins
<Pegacorn> LIKE A BAWS
<Nittany_Tiger> Where did the serial killer Pinkamina thing start from?
<Nick> ah ok
*RobotPinkamena snickers menacingly
<RobotPinkie> Party of One, I guess.
*Pegacorn doesn't care,LIKE A BAWS
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, she's not a serial killer there..
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe if she stayed insane though...
<RobotPinkie> I mean she obviously wasn't psycho before the Sonic Rainboom either...
<RobotPinkie> lol she's just a bit emo in the episode, I think she's cute.
<Pegacorn> So,what now?I ate the muffins.
<AllisZero> Though she shows clear signs of mental instability including schizophrenia
<AllisZero> Cute, absolutely
<RobotPinkie> Oh, she's gone now anyway.
<Pegacorn> Wow.RobotPinkemena went away.
<AllisZero> Network problems
<RobotPinkie> I guess you'll never know what you ate.
<Insane_Lugia> you have quite the list of friends skylands >:)
<AllisZero> WHO STORES 2 GIGABYTE PHOTOSHOP FILES ON A NETWORK DRIVE
*Pegacorn calls Batman to figure out what he ate.
<RobotPinkie> I'm guessing they had something... or somepony... in them.
<Skylands> 10Where?
<AllisZero> The amount of Fanfiction FIM gets is amusing and scary at the same time
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe you ate Derpy.
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah
<Dermathil> yeah
*Pegacorn coughts and spits out a hair
<Pegacorn> It's yellow.OOOH MAH GAWD.
<RobotPinkie> Ewww, Pegacorn... I told you not to eat them, seriously.
<AllisZero> Phew, it's not Fluttershy. Alright. Move on
<Pegacorn> THIS IS BAT COUNTRY.
<Insane_Lugia> da
<Skylands> 10Those are my watchers :P
<AllisZero> 80 MB/s transfer speeds over gigabit ethernet, like a boss?
<Insane_Lugia> lol
<RobotPinkie> I love bats, they're adorable.
<Pegacorn> Um.....why do you still have your hacksaw RobotPinkie?
<Skylands> 10Not necessarily a friend, but someone who basically 'subscribes' to me because they like my artwork etc.
<RobotPinkie> I... don't remember....
<Insane_Lugia> lol its weird i refuse to subscribe to people.
<AllisZero> The plot thickens.
<Nick> why?
<AllisZero> FFF-
<AllisZero> I didn't know Alt F+4 would close the java window. Great.
<Pegacorn> GASP
<Insane_Lugia> not sure, i think because ihad bad xp of subscribeing to people like not knowing how to unsubscribe. then my inbox got flooded by videos i did not really want to watch.
<Pegacorn> ALLIS IS SPY!
<RobotPinkie> Is this raspberry jam on the hacksaw?
*RobotPinkie licks hacksaw to confirm
<Skylands> 10YouTube, ah
<RobotPinkie> ...oh, this isn't jam...
<Insane_Lugia> im refering to youtube and facebook btw
<Nick> Ah I see
<Pegacorn> What is it then?
<RobotPinkie> You don't want to know.
<Nittany_Tiger> I can do a very good Jigsaw.
<Nick> yeah I do get annoyed when my inbox on DA is flooded with too many pics
<Nittany_Tiger> I have done it once.
<RobotPinkie> It rhymes with "flood," is all I can say...
<Pegacorn> inb4 I WANT TO PLAY A GAME
<Nittany_Tiger> It's not game time.
<Pegacorn> What time is it then?
<RobotPinkie> It's pony time, of course
<Nittany_Tiger> Party time.
<Insane_Lugia> ive saved over 500 different photos of lugia on my facebook. 3 albums =\
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm thinking of a Saw crossover. I know exactly who would play the game.
<Insane_Lugia> i enjoy looking at them... but, i dont care to see repets which is why i did it.
<Nittany_Tiger> In fact, it's 80% written in my head.
<AllisZero> Not me, I only have a PS3.
<RobotPinkie> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_li7pzzvgL31qafrh6.png
<Nittany_Tiger> Unlike weather stories, I don't think Saw stories have been done.
<RobotPinkie> You mean fanfic?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> If they were done, they were probably on the later flicks. I think the earlier ones make for better starting points.
<Nittany_Tiger> The later ones were more gorefests.
<Insane_Lugia> by the way, today is a good day for me. i feel settled and not hyped. so i shouldnt be too off topic today :)
<Nittany_Tiger> The earlier ones were more psychological.
<Insane_Lugia> anybody like lil wayne?
<Nittany_Tiger> I enjoyed them all, but I consider #4 the peak of the series.
<Nittany_Tiger> And #5 the lowpoint.
<Skylands> 10Me
<AllisZero> This sketch might actually work
<Skylands> 10Good to know you listen to something other than death metal :P
<AllisZero> I don't like the pose too much though
<Insane_Lugia> i like all sorts and not just death metal. blood drunk and deathklock are the only 2 deathmetals i know. im not really a fan my self but deathklock i fave.
<AllisZero> Know what, I should go buy a new chair.
<Insane_Lugia> as for blooddrunk, i love the album art mor ethen the music.
<AllisZero> Let's see... 5 hours per night, five nights a week is 25 hours, 12+ hours, usually, on weekends, so I'm typically sitting here for almost 50 hours a week
<RobotPinkie> Wow, someone else who doesn't hate the Saw movies. I am shocked.
<AllisZero> Yeah, that's probably why my neck is a mess by the end of Sunday
<Skylands> 10k, so why did you ask about Lil Wayne?
<Insane_Lugia> lol this mornin i woke up and one of lil wayne's songs was playing in my head. now i can't remebr what one it was.
<Skylands> 10How did it go?
<Pegacorn> WHO'S GONNA PLAY THE GAME?
<Ziltoid> I lost.
<RobotPinkie> Kinda think Saw 6 was the low point, though, but I haven't seen Saw 3D...
<RobotPinkie> lol Ziltoid just played, Pegacorn.
<AllisZero> Ziltoid: Damn it
<Ziltoid> Hi everyone
<RobotPinkie> hey Ziltoid
<Nittany_Tiger> Saw 3D (A.k.a. The Final Chapter) is nothing great.
<Insane_Lugia> i think i will start uploading more songs to my playlist on my tst profile.
<Nittany_Tiger> It doesn't put a good end to the series.
<Insane_Lugia> and how did what go.
<Skylands> 10The song
<Ziltoid> Anyone else saw this article? http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/societe/201108/18/01-4427068-intrigantes-pouliches-dans-les-rues-de-quebec.php#Slide-5-box-0
<Insane_Lugia> oh, i cant rember lol. i think it was let it rock but not positive
<RobotPinkie> But you think I should watch it?
<Skylands> 10That's by Kevin Rudolph
<Skylands> 10.w.
<AllisZero> Can't read French but that's funny
<Insane_Lugia> nah, i mean the let rock version of lil wayne.
<FreezeFrame> If you have Chrome it can translate it.
<Nittany_Tiger> If you've seen the rest, sure.
<Skylands> 10Lil Wayne is featured in it
<RobotPinkie> lol oh yeah, unfortunately not G4 ponies :P
<Ziltoid> Vigilante ponies
<AllisZero> Can't read french but I get the idea, more or less, what's being said
<Pegacorn> I wonder if RobotPinkemena will return. (trololololo)
<Insane_Lugia> oh, ok. i see now.
<AllisZero> (Quebec) Have you noticed the fillies? Yes, this colorful toy. They are hanging from electric son
<AllisZero> Way to go Chrome

<RainBroDash> 10also dat sonic rainboom
<Insane_Lugia> not a fan but i like 3 or 4
<Skylands> 10Tool..?
<RobotPinkie> WOW
<AllisZero> Whoooa
<Nittany_Tiger> That's just cloud refraction.
<AllisZero> Wtb flying a jet fighter at some point in my life
<Insane_Lugia> http://www.youtube.com/user/elvarg72?feature=mhee#p/f/42/UUXBCdt5IPg
<Nittany_Tiger> There's no (Physics bending warning) compression of water out of vapor due to a high pressure wave there.
<Nittany_Tiger> I never get tired of sonic rainbooms.
<Insane_Lugia> the video is super weird but also pretty neat to look at because its different.
<RobotPinkie> Well no, but I've never seen anything like it, still. :P
<Pegacorn> Not much is going on,except that when i play L4D2,i get achievements.
<Nittany_Tiger> If they were real, I'd get funding to study them.
<AllisZero> Oh god the neighbors are in my backyard
*RobotPinkie cracks open a beer
<AllisZero> And I'm wearing my Homer Simpson pajamas
<Nittany_Tiger> To be honest, the only "mystery" is the added energy needed to pull water out of the vapor phase, and that's a thermo equation.
<RobotPinkie> Cheers, ponies
<AllisZero> Thanks buzzkillington, we'll still choose to ignore the science and say it's magic!
<Nittany_Tiger> Energy being pulled out of a pressure wave.
<RobotPinkie> Rainbows are made in a factory in Equestria...
<Nittany_Tiger> Well sorry I have a physics degree. :p
<RobotPinkie> Just thought I'd point that out. :P
<RobotPinkie> lol it's alright, I'm studying physics right now.
<Skylands> 10Song is okayish
<AllisZero> I like physics, quite a bit
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm studying meteorology, too.
<AllisZero> I just never had a knack for it in school
<Ziltoid> Rainbows aint physics Rainbows is rainbows
<Ziltoid> Science.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not going to buzzkill the show physics.
<RobotPinkie> Right now we're studying optics, so rainbows are relevant. :P
<Nittany_Tiger> In fact, it would be fun to back it up.
<Insane_Lugia> i like how its little hip hop mixed with soft rock
<RobotPinkie> True.
<Insane_Lugia> they lyrics icould care less for due to it being depressing
<Nick> like the costume vid :)
<AllisZero> That picture has massive potential for trollage, you know that right
<Skylands> 10Somehow I think I made myself hate soft rock lolol
<RobotPinkie> Which one?
<RobotPinkie> http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01709/plane-rainbow_1709821i.jpg
<AllisZero> The F22rainbow
<Skylands> 10Used to love it, now I prefer hard/metal/whatever else
<Insane_Lugia> hmm, well from my observances, you only hate what you choose to if you like it or not. its all state ofmind.
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah
<AllisZero> (Well, until one anon decides to make the calculations of how much energy it takes to send a car flying three stories with just a quarter)
<Insane_Lugia> the videos with lyrics on my play list, are more of what iam in to
<SilverMane> takes the same amount of energy with a brick, a cannon, or a massive slingshot
<AllisZero> (And the fact that the quarter would disintegrate before it reached the car at the required velocity)
<SilverMane> just much more concentrated
<RobotPinkie> clearly there would have been a sonic rainboom if this plane had just passed the sound barrier, though....
<Pegacorn> Ohai SilverMane
<RobotPinkie> hey SilverMane
<SilverMane> ohai mark
<SilverMane> i mean hey Pegacorn and Robotpinkie
<Nittany_Tiger> If you converted the right amount of mass in the quarter to energy...
<SilverMane> just because i can...

<Insane_Lugia> i do like some of their songs but it dont mean i like all of them. i fave eminem if i had to choose. he has the largest list of liked songs out of any other artice
<RobotPinkie> I have no idea what that means.
<RobotPinkie> Alright, AllisZero
<RobotPinkie> See you later
<Dermathil> suddenly, mobileDCD is logged in
<Skylands> 10So you like rock/rap hip-hop stuff, it appears
*Pegacorn jumps up and then smashes down right in front of SilverMane.

<Steven_Magnet> 6 Rarity is 40% Lame. (1595)
<RobotPinkie> I think I'm going to install Morrowind...
<Insane_Lugia> overall yes but rap is eww.... i like the rap that involves hip hop and little rock mix.
<SilverMane> i just looked at the Nightly Roundup. what about it?
<Insane_Lugia> the rap where all they do is talk to a beat = annoying
<SilverMane> RobotPinkie, I did that, and it was... boring. After Oblivion, i'm spoiled
<SilverMane> can't ever go back
<RobotPinkie> Eh, I feel the opposite way.
<Dermathil> the newspaper article about a lady hanging ponies on phone lines/electric wires, did you see it?
<Insane_Lugia> lil wayne is a good example. hes a raper but has a good beat+hiphop in it.
<RobotPinkie> I can't stand the epic level 40 sandcrabs in Oblivion
<SilverMane> epic level... sandcrabs?
<Skylands> 10I see
<SilverMane> but ya Dermathil, i did
<RobotPinkie> I mean it's a great game in so many ways, but I can't enjoy it for very long thanks to the leveling system.
<SilverMane> what about it?
<Dermathil> Dat be my city
<Dermathil> And I get that very newspaper every morning.
<SilverMane> so you have crazy pony ladies in your town
<Insane_Lugia> honestly ive got no idea how to explainw hat i like with out getting the wrong idea.
<Dermathil> I don't know how I missed that article
<Nittany_Tiger> I couldn't get into Morrowind.
<Nittany_Tiger> Tried twice. Couldn't get into it.
<Skylands> 10Like, you don't want to listen to too much of one genre
<RobotPinkie> I like that Morrowind kicks you in the nuts and steps on your face if you try to go to somewhere you're not equipped for. :P
<Insane_Lugia> naioled it
<Insane_Lugia> nailed it*
<Skylands> 10You like variety
<Skylands> 10as do I
<SilverMane> RobotPinkie, the slow energy regain rate, difficulty walking places, and horrendously involved talking system made teh game real slow for me
<Pegacorn> RAAAAAAAAAAR
<Skylands> 10I am willing to try most genres, apart from classical/jazz stuff
<Insane_Lugia> oh my gosh by usher is prob one of my faves due to how he sings with the beat.
<SilverMane> plus, combat felt a little... bland, after oblivion
<SilverMane> although the dungeons did feel like a crawler from P&P times
*Pegacorn randomly rushes at SilverMane and smashes him into the ground
<Insane_Lugia> ever heard "gotta get away from you"?
<SilverMane> Pegacorn, you know i'm immune to knock-down attacks
<RobotPinkie> It has its problems, Silvermane, but I just can't handle the leveling system in Oblivion. If I'm maxed out, I shouldn't have a problem just punching out a tiny crab with one blow.
<SilverMane> also, did you guys see that Trixie comic on EQD?
<Skylands> 10The Offspring?
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah
<Nittany_Tiger> No.
<Insane_Lugia> yes
<Skylands> 10Yep
<Nittany_Tiger> Unless I forgot I saw it.
<Insane_Lugia> at 1:20 is where i take intrest inthe song.
<RobotPinkie> I think it's fairly likely to happen, really. They know Trixie has a big fanbase, and people want to see more of NMM
<Skylands> 10That's where they start to think
<Skylands> 10to sing*
<Skylands> 10Odd typo
<Insane_Lugia> yes, that is somethign like what ilook for in differnt songs. i love how offspring sings there.
<SilverMane> it would be... such an awesome episode
<SilverMane> The Fall of Trixie
<SilverMane> but it's simply too... mature, grimdark even
<RobotPinkie> plus I think people would go crazy with teh mad if Luna got a bad case of NMM again.
<Nittany_Tiger> Nightmare Trixie?
<Pegacorn> ORLY SilverMane?
<Nittany_Tiger> Just saw it.
<Insane_Lugia> how do you like porn star danceing?
<Nittany_Tiger> I would go nuts if Luna fell again.
<SilverMane> what needs to happen honestly, is a spin-off series targeted directly at us, if they want to ensure they never lose us. I mean i love the innocence and youthful games of the current, but some darkness to pervade an innocent world? take my money
<RobotPinkie> It makes sense, Trixie wants people to revere her for her power, NMM is probably looking for someone to inhabit.
<Skylands> 10Where have I heard that before, is it a band or song?
<Nittany_Tiger> If she wasn't "killed" in Ep 2.
<Insane_Lugia> http://www.youtube.com/user/elvarg72?feature=mhee#p/f/9/hP_wjflirPM
<RobotPinkie> I don't think it's too dark, they can do it with the same mood as Friendship is Magic 1&2
<Nittany_Tiger> Which I know there are hints of that.
<SilverMane> I don't know, Nightmare's existance is only explored in fanfics
<RobotPinkie> Well, I can dream, anyway. :P
<Insane_Lugia> ehem "al" songs with lyrics in my faves on youtube are songs i love. i hate to spamm my page with crap id on;t like XD
<Insane_Lugia> i don't like*
<SilverMane> we don't know if it was an existential being that corrupted Luna, or the inner darkness that inhabited her, or perhaps simply herself being dramatic and whatnot
<ValtheJean> g'morning gents
<SilverMane> allo
<Skylands> 10Hm
<ValtheJean> and if I might interrupt the conversation:
<Pegacorn> Ohai ValtheJean
<RobotPinkie> 'sup ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> I believe Faust did say it was possession
<FreezeFrame> SilverMane: Actually, Faust confirmed that Nightmare Moon was more than just Luna
<Nittany_Tiger> ^
<ValtheJean> howdy Silvermane, Pegacorn and RobotPinkie :D
<Nick> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFOXBWPY8I I'm not into cosplaying myself, but I would LOVE to have that costume
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: Shadow Lugia Dancing | by WizardGir | Length: | Views: 16 067
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I think she did, Val
<SilverMane> oh really? must have missed that one.
<FreezeFrame> It was in a DA comment
<ValtheJean> it's a really obscure one
<ValtheJean> I've only seen it once or twice
<SilverMane> well, if it was possession, then there's a good chance for a recurring
<Insane_Lugia> i know nobody here cares a bout runescape b ut... anybody know the name of this song? i would love to add it to my list <3 http://www.youtube.com/user/elvarg72?feature=mhee#p/f/31/9ojYFwi-zVQ
<ValtheJean> well
<ValtheJean> she is confirmed for season 2 (luna that is)
<SilverMane> which would be nice, as we need a new conflict arc
<SilverMane> hey Ghosties
<ValtheJean> so long as there's no god damn Nyx, I'll be happy
<RobotPinkie> I wouldn't mind them getting some influences from G1 in that sense.
<SilverMane> oh ValtheJean, you and your hatred of things i know little about
<ValtheJean> ohai Ghosties
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> She's a fanfic character
<Insane_Lugia> that shadow lugia is rilly at a-kon
<ValtheJean> and she's been taking over ponychan
<ValtheJean> like seriously
<Skylands> 10Sounds like Disturbed, Insane
<SilverMane> which is why she'll never show up
<RBD> 10Hey Ty
<ValtheJean> more than Spiderman, Gary Oak, and Nigel combined
<SilverMane> just like SOCKS
<Ghosties> 4Hey everyone
<Lightumbreon> 06i DO have a runescape ACC.... but didn't touch it in months
<Sathi> 7hey
<RobotPinkie> Hey Ghosties
<ValtheJean> well, I could easily see them have a background character put on socks for the fan squees
<ValtheJean> whereas Nyx, dear god no
<RobotPinkie> 'sup RBD, welcome back Sathi
<Pegacorn> brb,gptta eat.
<SilverMane> socks, the Lyra x Bonbon, Nyx, Midnight, Trixie's origins (mother, sister, etc) and Derpy Hooves family
<Insane_Lugia> im lvl 137 if you need help on quest, killing monsters, anti crash, etc.
<SilverMane> none of those things will show up, sadly
<RobotPinkie> Is this some kind of mod intervention for our discussion? :P
<Insane_Lugia> just halla at me
<ValtheJean> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<ValtheJean> I want Derpy and Dinky :(
<Sathi> 7bewareeeee
*SilverMane surprise glomps RainBroDash
<Insane_Lugia> ill check out distrubed see what ig et
<SilverMane> Derpy Hooves: They gave her derpy eyes, we gave her a family
<RobotPinkie> I hope Derpy gets her own episode
<ValtheJean> I do not RobotPinkie, unfortunately
<RobotPinkie> I mean her name will be Ditzy Doo, but whatever
<SilverMane> she is confirmed for at least being a minor char, rather than merely a cameo
<ValtheJean> I like her as a background pony that is like a "Where's Waldo" thing
<SilverMane> she even has a speaking role
<ValtheJean> if they made her more than just appearances, they run the risk of upsetting the fandom for "portraying her wrong"
<ValtheJean> ung...
<ValtheJean> aaaaaaand the end has begun
<Skylands> 10Try Stricken
<RobotPinkie> lol, you're so negative :P
<RainBroDash> 10:P
<ValtheJean> only about everything you like ;)
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<SilverMane> she's going to talk normal, but the way we portrayed her in fanfics will last beyond the 'canon' derpy
<RainBroDash> 10well
<Ghosties> 4Beware? You're in for a scare?
<RainBroDash> 10caramel is worst pony after all
<ValtheJean> btw, I would SO buy a "Where's Derpy" book (Where's Waldo)
<ValtheJean> O_o
<RobotPinkie> So you don't want the mane 6 in the show, ValtheJean ? :P
<ValtheJean> you son of a bitch
<SilverMane> lol
<ValtheJean> The Mane 6 are clearly overrated
<ValtheJean> needs more Caramel :P
<SilverMane> LEAVE LUNA TRIXIE AND FLUTTERSHY AND TWILIGHT AND RARITY ALONE
<RobotPinkie> ...yeah, I rest my case :P
<SilverMane> you can have the others. EXCEPT OCTAVIA
<ValtheJean> I'm not sure where it's become a stereotype that I hate everything though
<ValtheJean> I love many things, like ponies!
<RobotPinkie> But you hate all ponies except Caramel, Val :P
<Skylands> 10Maybe not
<ValtheJean> untrue!
<ValtheJean> the only pony I hate is Trixie
<ValtheJean> and Nyz
<ValtheJean> nyx*
<Nittany_Tiger> Do you like severe weather?
<ValtheJean> but Nyx doesn't count
<ValtheJean> because she isn't real
<RobotPinkie> Okay you like Nyx, but she doesn't count.
<ValtheJean> and I only say Rainbow Dash sucks because CERTAIN mods like to troll me :P
<Ghosties> 4Not me
<ValtheJean> and you have my thanks Ghosties :P
<Ghosties> 4Too much RD love if you ask me
<Dermathil> suddenly ghosties
<RobotPinkie> and my axe, Ghosties!
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<RainBroDash> 10and lol valthejean
<Pegacorn> I'm back
<Dermathil> suddenly Rainbrodash
<ValtheJean> oh RainbroDash, you know I <3 you
<RobotPinkie> Suddenly Seymour
<ValtheJean> I just hate the things you do :P
<Insane_Lugia> this is one of my fave techno's http://www.youtube.com/user/elvarg72#p/f/30/xYygnv09urQ
<RobotPinkie> So you'd say no to a S2 Caramel episode, Val?
<Insane_Lugia> it gets good when it picks up
<Skylands> 10The voice makes me think Cascada
<Insane_Lugia> never heard of cascada
<Skylands> 10Pop/Dance singer
<Skylands> 10Anyway, this song you linked is more Dance than techno
<SilverMane> let me know if Prince-Dari comes on. We need more DURRRRRGGAAAANNN
<Insane_Lugia> hmm maybe. after 2:40 is where i start to really like it.
<SilverMane> in that sexy, sultry accent of his
<ValtheJean> Well, that depends
<SilverMane> and i'll be back; going to go get food
<Pegacorn> dat SilverMane
<ValtheJean> see, if the episode basically confirmed every aspect of fanon I've created for him, I would fangasm so hard the eather's continents would reshape
<ValtheJean> if it were anything else (which it most likely would be) then no
<SilverMane> inb4 Silvermane episode... I'd die if that happened
<ValtheJean> lol
<RobotPinkie> SO you're hoping Caramel has no lines in S2, pretty much?
<SilverMane> i don't have an ego, what are you talking about >.>
<ValtheJean> pretty much
<RobotPinkie> I mean I can understand that
<ValtheJean> but for example
<ValtheJean> if it saw him and Toffee visiting the cake shop
<ValtheJean> I would Squee
<ValtheJean> very manly Squees mind you, but squee nontheless
<SilverMane> all of our fanfic-based personalities are never to be; so i'll never get my Twixie ship with baby Midnight
<Skylands> 10Darude - Sandstorm would be a good example of techno
<RobotPinkie> All my fanon will come to pass, though.
<SilverMane> nor wise, but word-confused Derpy
<Insane_Lugia> i have that one and ive heard it so much im over it lol
<ValtheJean> well see, this is why derpy shouldn't become a larger character
<ValtheJean> there are so many interpretations of her
<ValtheJean> someone is BOUND to be upset by what they make
<RobotPinkie> I trust the FiM team to do her justice, though...
<ValtheJean> well yeah, I'm sure they'll do fine
<ValtheJean> I'm just saying *some* people wont like it
<Insane_Lugia> disturbed another way to die first 60 secs i love. but after that i dont care for the song.
<RobotPinkie> Well someone is bound to be upset by what the mane 6 do in season 2, so...
<ValtheJean> I suppose that's fair
<RobotPinkie> I don't think they can please everyone no matter what.
<ValtheJean> I shall concede to your argument then RobotPinkie :P
<Skylands> 10Hell - Disturbed FTW
<Ziltoid> Spoilers Luna joins the mane 6 in season 2
<Insane_Lugia> lol
<RobotPinkie> I gracefully accept your concession :P
<ValtheJean> inb4 BOOOOOO YEAAAAAAAAAH
<RobotPinkie> If that happened, I'd be very happy, ZIltoid :P
<ValtheJean> you know, I'm sure this is probably a minority opinion, but I'd like to see more CMC. At the very least, CMC interacting with the mane 6
<Ziltoid> But really all I want more gummy
<RobotPinkie> I think they did imply a lot about Luna through the first two episodes.
<RobotPinkie> Ohh yeah, I love the CMC episodes from season 1
*ValtheJean wants more Sweetie Songs <.< >.>
<RobotPinkie> I'm kind of split on whether I want to see them get their cutie marks or not
<Insane_Lugia> ewww my frind sent me a song "black and yellow" is the name of it
<Insane_Lugia> too much repete
<Ziltoid> The CMC will never gte their cutie marks
<Ziltoid> Ever
<RobotPinkie> I mean Sweetie Belle's cutie mark... well that I can see happening.
<RobotPinkie> lol Ziltoid, you remind me of that VGcats comic
<Skylands> 10Was it Patrick? I always see him saying that
<Pegacorn> RANDOM EXPLOSION OUTTA NOWHERE
<Ziltoid> Sweetie Belles cutie mark should Amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Insane_Lugia> nah friend on skype
<ValtheJean> I think it should be a Gospel Choir singer :P
<Ziltoid> I havnt checked out VGcats in a while
<ValtheJean> he made a pony comic, but then removed it
<RobotPinkie> http://i929.photobucket.com/albums/ad133/life_mage12/CMCcomic.jpg
<RobotPinkie> That one :P
<ValtheJean> it's kind of funny actually
<HyperMetalLugia> Was it Pattyrick?
<Nittany_Tiger> First panel of latest VGC is 20% cooler than the rest.
<ValtheJean> if you look at comics prior to that one
<RobotPinkie> Know why he removed it, Val?
<ValtheJean> he hid ponies in some of the comics
<Nittany_Tiger> Scott is so damn lazy with that comic.
<ValtheJean> he "said" he didn't like the quality
<Ziltoid> LULWUT
<ValtheJean> but I think he just didn't want people knowing he was a brony
<Ziltoid> dint know they did an mlp one
<ValtheJean> which I can respect, but meh
<Ziltoid> made*
<Nittany_Tiger> I saw that comic. It wasn't great.
<ValtheJean> it's probably because he removed it a few hours later
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay
<Nittany_Tiger> He removed it because he didn't like it.
<Insane_Lugia> i like some solja boy. i think his lyrics are funny stuff inthis song. http://www.youtube.com/user/elvarg72#p/f/25/R-qu1ZC-QIs and who is pattyrick?
<Ziltoid> Really?
<ValtheJean> but yeah, check the comic where he nostalgias about star trek
<ValtheJean> look very closely at Aeris' computer screen :P
<RobotPinkie> I thought it was pretty funny.
<Nittany_Tiger> At the time, I didn't know the comic was based on an episode because I didn't see any of the show yet.
<ValtheJean> haha
<Pegacorn> Beware the carrots.
<Skylands> 10Pattyrick = Patrick, he goes by Pattyrick on the IRC
<ValtheJean> so am I the only one who likes to think that Rarity and Sweetie were adopted by Hippie Mules?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<RobotPinkie> Yes, probably. :P
<ValtheJean> I just think that would be so funny
<Insane_Lugia> neve rment him
<Insane_Lugia> never ment him
<Nittany_Tiger> I just saw that.
<Nittany_Tiger> RBD is hidden in the latest one.
<ValtheJean> yeah
<ValtheJean> that's kind of why I think he just didn't want to "come out of the stable" yet
<Skylands> 10Soulja Boy, I remember 'Crank That'
<Nittany_Tiger> "He called me a mule!"
<Nittany_Tiger> Rarity's parents being mules would be ironic.
<ValtheJean> well yeah
<Barry> hallo
<RobotPinkie> He's linked to PMV stuff sometimes, though...
<Pegacorn> A-CHUCK NORRIIIIIIIIIIIIS!
<ValtheJean> it's like if you're parents are a certain stereotype or ethnicity, that means you "have the rights" to say jokes about that
<ValtheJean> hello Barry
<RobotPinkie> albeit slightly covertly
<RobotPinkie> hey Barry
<Insane_Lugia> "dunkin on the gang, i looked in the mirror and said whats up, nick nack pattywack give a dog a bone, all work no play, this my playground" i think are funny
<RobotPinkie> So I can only joke about bronies if my parents are bronies?
<Nittany_Tiger> When I first saw "A Dog and Pony Show," I wonder why the dogs didn't just torture or threaten Rarity into making her shut up.
<RobotPinkie> Time to get to convertin'!
<ValtheJean> I'm just saying that it's a common societal norm
<Nittany_Tiger> *wondered
<ValtheJean> like for example, if you're african american only YOU are allowed to say racist jokes. Am I making sense?
<RobotPinkie> I know, Val
<Insane_Lugia> no luck on disturbed with that song i asked a bout earlier a go.
<Skylands> 10Brb
<Insane_Lugia> cya soonm
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC_X_1pFaI8&feature=player_embedded
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm a white male Christian. I'm automatically hated by three groups.
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Hitlers reaction to bronies in germany" - "It looks like hitler had some serious problems with bronies in europe. It&#39;s my first video. Leave comments please, if it&#39;s good i will keep making more. I do..."
<ValtheJean> haha
<ValtheJean> I love these hitler videos
<ValtheJean> I liked the "Hitler banned from xbox" the most
<Pegacorn> Me too
<Ziltoid> THat one is espcially great
<Nittany_Tiger> If I get to select a B movie, we're watching that movie.
<ValtheJean> haha
<ValtheJean> it's actually a pretty good movie
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, that one kinda set it off as a meme
<Nittany_Tiger> It's all subtitles, though.
<Nittany_Tiger> That's the only thing that could keep it from being selected.
<ValtheJean> well yeah, that's what foreign movies in other languages do :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I know that it prevented a previous title from being selected.
<ValtheJean> wait, are subtitled movies not allowed?
<RobotPinkie> which one?
<Nittany_Tiger> Downfall.
<Ghosties> 4Subtitled movies are finnicky
<Ziltoid> Downfall as a B movie I dont think that would qualify
<Nittany_Tiger> It's the movie that the Hitler memes are based off of.
<Ghosties> 4There's something of a blurred line
<ValtheJean> awwwwww
<Ghosties> 4Admittedly, I would love to see Downfall
<RobotPinkie> no I mean which one didn't get picked because it had subtitles?
<ValtheJean> and here I was going to suggest To Live if I ever got the lottery :(
<Ghosties> 4Downfall would, ironically, be A movie in my eyes
<RobotPinkie> or rather wasn't allowed
<Nittany_Tiger> Some French flick.
<Pegacorn> Me too Ghosties.
<Ziltoid> yeah I agree on A
<Ghosties> 4Die Whell, I think
<RobotPinkie> aw
<Ghosties> 4RBD was gonna pick it, I believe
<RobotPinkie> well that ruins my A movie pick...
<Pegacorn> inb4 RBD is afk
<RobotPinkie> well at least I have my B movie pick...
<Nittany_Tiger> Ooh, severe thunderstorm watch for me.
<Ghosties> 4We haven't had a foreign film yet. That's one area we haven't explored.
<ValtheJean> oh oh oh!
<RobotPinkie> if I ever get the A movie pick, I will pretend my B movie is an A movie.
<ValtheJean> To Live! To Live!
<Ghosties> 4It would appear that screening certain films would be best
*ValtheJean has now just jynxed himself from ever winning the lotto :P

<Pegacorn> Ohai ValtheJean.

<Dermathil> I will have to close this when I have visit arriving.
<prince-dari> Fucking Skylanders.
<SilverMane> then again, the original trilogy and the new trilogy are the only Spyro games that are any good, and the new trilogy is only good due to them using the story I wrote when i was 11
*Dermathil cuts Dari's leash loose.

<SilverMane> and then they did it
<RobotPinkie> Thank you for understanding, Pegacorn
<SilverMane> WOOOT
<ValtheJean> oh dear god! IT'S DURRRRRRRRGARRRRRRRRRR
<SilverMane> DURRRRGAAANNN
<Insane_Lugia> yes... i told spyro someone cut his straight jacket off of me and he says "ahhh no way! your still too insane to be let loose!" then he put me in a nother one. as for the aslyum... fluttershy decided to let me out.
<RobotPinkie> induring DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGAN
<Nittany_Tiger> I loved the old CoDs.
<prince-dari> Nittany_Tiger: MW2 multiplayer is best because quickscopes. :P
*Pegacorn sees a Karma Charger in the distance
<Nick> ah ok :P
<SilverMane> wtf am i listening to...
*Nick flees from the mad lugia! "Halp Police!"
<ValtheJean> wait...you've got some purple haired guy now?
<Nittany_Tiger> The last time I played MW2 MP, the other team just harrier spammed us to death.
<RobotPinkie> nonsense, best multiplayer is Portal 2 because it's actually fun to play.
<Insane_Lugia> l
<ValtheJean> did I miss a game of this?
<Nittany_Tiger> Killstreaks are the worst idea ever.
<Pegacorn> OHGOD RUN AWAY!
<SilverMane> ValtheJean, that's Vehrn
<Pegacorn> KARMA CHARGER IN THE DISTANCE!
<ValtheJean> Vehrn...
<ValtheJean> does he just like adding superfluous letters to every name?
<Nittany_Tiger> Reward elite players with tools to throw the game out of balance. Brilliant!
*RobotPinkie tackles karma charger out of a 20th storey window. "KARMAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, you mean it's fun to screw with your partner by launching them into lasers or removing their light bridge from under them.
<prince-dari> It was still fun.
<prince-dari> :P
<Nittany_Tiger> And have them whine about deathstreaks and cheap tricks.
<RobotPinkie> Both, Dashite :P
<Ghosties> 4Who the fuck is talking?
*ValtheJean needs to educate Dari on Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
<Dermathil> dari
<Pegacorn> COACH IS BIRD
<ValtheJean> :P
<Ghosties> 4Holy mother of god, the fuck is wrong with your voice
<Dermathil> Valthejean, you are SOOOOOOOOOOOO old-school.
<Ghosties> 4You sound like you're croaking
<ValtheJean> he's a brit, they are all cooky :P
<RobotPinkie> lolwat is dari talking about?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm lucky if I can get a 4-kill streak on a match.
<Pegacorn> Prepare to witness the full might of a Karma Charge.
<Ghosties> 4Well it's true
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil and proud of it :P
<Ghosties> 4No it doesn't, I've spoken to you in Skype
<Bartolinni> hello
<Dashite> Half-Life 2: Deathmatch? Fuck that! C&C Renegade bitches!
<Ghosties> 4You don't sound like your sipping on battery acid
<ValtheJean> hello Batrolinni
<RobotPinkie> Liking a game defines who you are?
<Nittany_Tiger> And BC2 is just rage fuel for me because the servers insult me for playing badly.
<ValtheJean> phhhhfff, C&C
*Pegacorn tackles Nick and carries him over a 80 mile distance.
<RobotPinkie> I'm confused...
<Ghosties> 4No, it's not
<Ghosties> 4No, not at all
<Sumica> it's true it is how he talks we even have recordings
<Dashite> ValtheJean, you know it's so much better than Half Life. :p
<Dermathil> Dari usually sounds like this during streams
<SilverMane> is he talking right now? i can't hear
<Dashite> Dari sounds a little worse right now than normal.
<Pegacorn> OH GOD
<Ghosties> 4Dude, seriously, you sound you're 73
<ValtheJean> Dashite: Ha...ha...AHAHA....AHAHAAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA. Oh god...Oh god my insides hurt
<Ghosties> 4*like you're
<Dashite> That last sentence wasn't so bad.
<Dermathil> LOL
<RobotPinkie> oh lawd
<Ghosties> 4Maybe
<Dashite> ValtheJean, Half Life 2 is boring.
<Pegacorn> What is it Val?
<Dermathil> >HL2 is boring
<Nittany_Tiger> HL 2 was good.
<Dermathil> say what again?
<ValtheJean> Dashite: Oh you.
<Ghosties> 4You need to whet your whistle
<Dashite> Boooring!
<Dermathil> The Singleplayer is great
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll miss story-driven FPSs.
<ValtheJean> Troll detected: Firing Orbital Friendship cannon!
<Nittany_Tiger> Everything AAA is going MP.
<Dermathil> the Deathmatch is dead though
<Ghosties> 4Seriously, get some water or something down your throat
<RobotPinkie> Valve games are the worst games ever. They just rush shit out every couple of months without any quality control.
<Dashite> Played it once. Tried to play it again, and I can't do it.
<RobotPinkie> trolololololo
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, I know man!
<Nittany_Tiger> RobotPinkie: And EA and Activision don't?
<Pegacorn> RobotPinkie,i see your trolling.Time to chain you to the wall!
<Dermathil> Nittany, RP is trolling.
<Dashite> >sarcasm detector is broken...
*Pegacorn chains RobotPinkie to the wall
<ValtheJean> well to be fair
<ValtheJean> recent Valve is like that
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh.
<ValtheJean> old Valve wasn't
<RobotPinkie> Bobby Kotick is the one voice of reason in the entire gaming world!
<ValtheJean> but recent Valve definitely yes
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I'm kidding.
<Nittany_Tiger> I dunno.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'd hate Valve to turn bad like the rest of the large publishers.
<RobotPinkie> I wub Valve
<Ghosties> 4Damn, that must have been one harsh cold
<ValtheJean> >implying they haven't already
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't consider any of them to be good except Valve.
<Dermathil> Valthejean, you are not seeing the sarcasm in RobotPinkie's statement. I hope you see it with the Bobby Kotick Statement
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, Valve has been trolling the entire gaming world for the past 4 years now.
<Pegacorn> I wonder what the hell RobotPinkemena is about.
<SilverMane> dear god, i'm listening to some random speach on birth order and psychological implications
<Ghosties> 4Question, Dari
<Sumica> RobotPinkie you are pushing the realms of believability.
<SilverMane> WHY CAN'T I FIND IT AND TURN IT OFF
<Ghosties> 4What are you playing?
<ValtheJean> Dermathil: that's irrelevant, I was just being fair because that is the case. Troll or not
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm wary of Valve
<Dashite> What's that, you guys want some Episode 3 news? Well we have a big announcement coming up!
<ValtheJean> and it's horrifying
<Ghosties> 4It looks pretty damn fleshed out
<RobotPinkie> I know, Sumica, or well I hoped I pushed WAY past it with that last statement about Kotick :P
<ValtheJean> I've seen Blink, and this game gives me worse nightmares
<SilverMane> oh ValtheJean, it's an amazing game.
<Ghosties> 4Who doesn't like it?
<ValtheJean> me
<Dashite> *Team Fortress 2 adds hats!*
<Dermathil> Val hates 75% of everything.
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<ValtheJean> It's a shit game
<Ghosties> 4ValtheJean
<SilverMane> it's based on NES design, with modern game designs
<ValtheJean> and it's an insult to classic RPGs
<Dermathil> He is very specific on his tastes.
<Ghosties> 4But there's so much shit to equip
<ValtheJean> lol
<RobotPinkie> Not everything Valve does is like... automatically golden
<SilverMane> ValtheJean, seriously, cool it. play it first, then dis it
<Ghosties> 4It's like a plethora of goodies
<Dermathil> Valthejean, it is a parody of classic RPGs, not an insult.
<RobotPinkie> but they're DAMN good
<Nittany_Tiger> It's getting really windy outside.
<ValtheJean> Hell yeah, it is you fucking British tea bagger :P
<SilverMane> honestly, Baldur's Gate is the game for lonely D&D players who can't get a party
<Dashite> No
<Pegacorn> AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAAAH
<ValtheJean> oh, oh! Oho! Silvermane, you amz good troll :P
<Dermathil> Valthejean keeps sounding like a PC extremist elitists.
<Ghosties> 4I think he hates your tea, bro
<SilverMane> not the tea!
<ValtheJean> lol Dermathil, I AM a PC extremist elitist
<RobotPinkie> Eh, there are very few games I actually hate.
<ValtheJean> I'm not even hiding it
<Dermathil> Seriously, he comeso ut as antagonistic.
<Ghosties> 4Of course it is
<RobotPinkie> This game right now, Mardek or whatever?
<Ghosties> 4You're British :P
<ValtheJean> besides, I've been watching Dari play this game
<ValtheJean> and I have yet to see anything I enjoy
<RobotPinkie> It looks like a lot of fun, except I'm annoyed with the long monologues...
*Pegacorn finds a leash made of adamantium and leashes dari with it.
<Pegacorn> MWAHAHAHAHA
<ValtheJean> I'm annoyed with the lack of any form of english mastery...
<SilverMane> RobotPinkie, you can press Z to skip dialogue
<Dermathil> I hope you do understand that it is a parody, though.
<ValtheJean> oh I do
<Pegacorn> I AM DEH UBAHMENSH.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, thanks SilverMane, might actually play this soon, then :P
<ValtheJean> but just because you're making a parody doesn't excuse being completely inept at it
<Dashite> Just cause ValtheJean has good taste in games unlike the rest of you. :p
<ValtheJean> Dashite: Oh you :P
<Ghosties> 4Dari, you should stream play Cthulhu Saves the World. Awesome 2D RPG game that came out this year
<RobotPinkie> I love the JRPG style, still
<SilverMane> he did an amazing job at it. it's one of the most highly lauded RPG on dozens of sites
<Dashite> Well, except for that Half Life thing. :p
<ValtheJean> haha
<Dermathil> he did
<Ghosties> 4It's really good
<Ghosties> 4Only $3?
<Ghosties> 4Hell yeah, great deal
<Nittany_Tiger> Getting really, really windy outside.
<SilverMane> ok, i'm freaking out
<Pegacorn> Dashite,u so troll.
<SilverMane> there is some random people talking in my headphones
<Dermathil> Valthejean, what is your opinion on MINECRAFT
<SilverMane> and i can't find them
<SilverMane> WHY WON'T THEY SHUT UP
<RobotPinkie> Though I prefer Morrowind to most JRPGs TBH :P
<Ghosties> 4Morrowind
<Ghosties> 4Fuck yes
<Dermathil> Silvermane, check your adverts
<Dashite> Why does everyone assume I'm a troll when I tell them I don't like Half Life. :(
<ValtheJean> Dermathil: Very clever concept, really good waste of time game.
<prince-dari> You not in Skype SilverMane? XD
<SilverMane> this computer doesn't have skype
<RobotPinkie> and Baldur's Gate 2... first one is a bit too clumsy
<Ghosties> 4And Minecraft is an excellent title
<Sumica> that's not your headphones it's the voices in your head.
<RobotPinkie> Icewind Dale, now that was a great RPG
<Dermathil> Valthejean, every game can be seen as a waste of time. Because it is not time spent on being productive for the society.
<ValtheJean> because the game likes to troll you dari :P
<Nittany_Tiger> And the power flickered.
<RobotPinkie> lol and I play Minecraft a lot, too
<ValtheJean> Dermathil, didn't mean it as an insult
<Pegacorn> Dashite,you have the right to not like a game.Just don't assume that everypony doesn't like it aswell.
<RobotPinkie> I'm a redstone addict
*Nittany_Tiger wonders if a tornado will go by.
<ValtheJean> I just meant to say it's a really good game if you just want to blow away a few hours
<Ghosties> 4What game does Dashite not like?
<Dermathil> Me neither, Valthejean. I am just stating a truth of this universe.
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<ValtheJean> :P
<Dashite> Pegacorn, I don't think it's possible to assume everyone doesn't like Half Life.
<Ghosties> 4Half Life
<Ghosties> 4I liked Half Life 2
<Pegacorn> HALF LIFE
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, when you examine their stats, look at the Defense and M. Defense. if it is at 30, it is typically immune to that attack type unless EXTREMELY powerful
<Pegacorn> HALF LIFE
<Dashite> Haven't played the first one.
<Pegacorn> LEFT 4 DEAD
<Pegacorn> TEAM FORTRESS 2
<ValtheJean> >says the fan of GunZ
<Ghosties> 4Left 4 Dead is pretty decent
<Dermathil> Wait, you don't like half-life due to bunny-hopping?
<Ghosties> 4I can't run TF2
<RobotPinkie> Half Life 2 was great, I have some problems with Episode 2 though...
<Dashite> What game is Dari talking about now?
<ValtheJean> it's the same god damn thing
<ValtheJean> GunZ
<ValtheJean> IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING
<Pegacorn> L4D and TF2 are awesome in my opinion.
<ValtheJean> so?
<ValtheJean> how the fuck does that matter?
<SilverMane> i didn't care for L4D, but that's because i have an expectation from zombie games that it went a different route with
<ValtheJean> it's still a bunch of retards flying around a room
<Pegacorn> ?
<Ghosties> 4Speaking of zombies
<ValtheJean> at least bunny hopping took skill...
<Sumica> I like S4 more then Gunz
<Dashite> Flying while shooting, SO WHO'S LOOK FORWARD TO TRIBES: ASCEND?!
<Pegacorn> I dun geddit SilverMane.
<Dermathil> Valthejean, you mean a street or a boat in GunZ?
<SilverMane> dun ged wha, pegacorn
<Ghosties> 4It certainly seems like CoD is really ramping up the whole zombie love with their latest map pack for Black Ops
<ValtheJean> Dermathil, I just meant room as in graphed area
<Pegacorn> Dun ged ur expectations.
<Ghosties> 4Yep, more map packs for Black Ops
<Sumica> Ah yes I heard they had a new one coming Dashite
<Dermathil> I know, val.
<Ghosties> 4Rezzurection
<Ghosties> 4Yes, that's how they spelled it
<Dermathil> SO, Who's looking forward to the release of Space Marine?
<Ghosties> 4Some game
<Dashite> Sumica, yup.
<Dermathil> Warhammer 40K title
<Dashite> lol
<Dermathil> 3rd person shooter
<Dermathil> Sadly, ultramarine hero
<Dashite> PLANETSIDE 2!
<Pegacorn> AN HERO
<Ghosties> 4There were no spoils that day
<Sumica> Wonder if EVE will ever get there shooter tie in game done.
<ValtheJean> nah, let him die
<Pegacorn> Les Miz.That's why.
<ValtheJean> I gave them a chance....one
<SilverMane> mmm eye juice
<Ghosties> 4Eye juice
<ValtheJean> now I want them dead :P
<Ghosties> 4The fuck
<SilverMane> just wait til you get some Chocolate Milk
<Pegacorn> And i have never seen Les Miz.I SUCK.
<Dermathil> wait, what did Dari say about Space Marine? I was off computer for the last 3 minutes
<Ghosties> 4It's a game
<SilverMane> isn't Space Marine about Warhammer or something?
<Dashite> Yes
<Sathi> 7Sumica PM

<Nittany_Tiger_> Space Marine. Free to play, but you have to pay us first.

<SilverMane> and almost all other games?
<Pegacorn> LA RESISTANCE LIVES ON.
<Dashite> Dammit CCP, Y U NO PC VERSION DUST 514?!
<Nittany_Tiger_> I thought Guild Wars was free except for the game itself.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Better than game + subscription fee.
<Ghosties> 4Guild Wars is free
<RobotPinkie> It's free subscription, yes
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Ghosties> 4The subscription, yeah
<Ghosties> 4Free to play

<Ghosties> 4Free to play, dari

<ValtheJean> and then the ogre changes into a woman

<Dashite> TAAAAAAAAANK!
<Pegacorn> BOOMER!
<SilverMane> 0make sure you kill Bartholio before someone, or else he goes Hulk on you

*RobotPinkie tackles Pegacorn through a 2000000th floor window
<SirSprinkles> lawl
<SilverMane> 0Vennie, that prick
<ValtheJean> well of course Dari, they can't reward you for thinking now can they? :P
<Pegacorn> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Skylands> 10Parents would never let me travel for something like that, which is also why I couldn't attend the BW mall tour
<SilverMane> 0Bernard is the best of those 4, but you won't know why for a great while
<RobotPinkie> Don't worry, we'll reach the ground in approximately 10 minutes.
<Ghosties> As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
<Insane_Lugia> brb later. Yoshi wants me to take her out for a walk.
<Pegacorn> Intill then,what should we do?
<Insane_Lugia> erm forgot u guys doint know yoshi... Yoshi = my iguana. sorry.
<Ghosties> Sprinks
<Sumica> Honistly not a clue. Dont realy know what others can bring but what I have seen I would be the only one in PST
<RobotPinkie> I dunno...
<Ghosties> Are you watching the interview?
<ValtheJean> kill off the useless one
<SilverMane> 0Mardek, why you so weak? i remember him being OP
<RobotPinkie> I didn't think it through that far.
<Sumica> I do seem to have a knack for finding uttlery random videos.
<SirSprinkles> ...clearly.
<Pattyrick> 07brb, I'm gonna eat some pie and shower
<Pegacorn> inb4 Obvious conclusion.
<ValtheJean> bitch I'll kill Emela if I damn well want to :P
<SirSprinkles> Hence: <SirSprinkles>: >EVE
<ValtheJean> that makes me so god damn happy
<SilverMane> 0then again, i got used to level 40 Mardek with best wapons and armor in the game and elemental attacks. yay 5k base damage
<Skyidle> 10Anyway, going out for a while
<SilverMane> 0Yes
*RobotPinkie prays to his god Loki and gets teleported to Valhalla.
<SilverMane> 0yes you can Prince-Dari
<Sumica> force them to drink i
<Sumica> it*
<Sathi> lol
<Pegacorn> WUT!
<Pegacorn> OH HELL NAH!
<SilverMane> 0classic Final Fantasy style potion usage
<ValtheJean> and then the glass breaks on her eyes
<SirSprinkles> And so far my opinion is basically just... "Well, it could be TacoWiz..."
<ValtheJean> "OH GOD MY EYES....MY EYES!"
*RobotPinkie drinks some mead
<Sathi> Why don't people know how to sell themselves...
<Nick> cya sky
*Pegacorn appears right in front of RobotPinkie and breaks a bottle of Bailey's over his head
<SilverMane> 0dammit Vennie, stop putting my tanks to sleep
*Nick gives her a california hand roll on her way out
<SirSprinkles> Not a clue.
<ValtheJean> inb4 you find out silver was trolling you and you WERE supposed to kill him last
<Sathi> moving on?
*RobotPinkie laps up what he can of the Bailey's
<SilverMane> 0kill Aalia asap
<Insane_Lugia> later sky
<Sumica> dat lag
<SirSprinkles> I suppose.
<SilverMane> 0don't bother with Power Attack, it's rarely worthwhile
<Pegacorn> U drunk now RobotPinkie?
<Sumica> a sword to the face will tend to do that
<RobotPinkie> I'm a robot, I get drunk if I don't have alcohol.
<Pegacorn> ?
<SilverMane> 0lol, you aren't Bender
<ValtheJean> Futurama reference ftw
<Pegacorn> lol
<RobotPinkie> :P
*EdwardNewgate drinks sake out of his big ass cup
<Vaporeon> 12:3
<SilverMane> 0Kill her!
<Vaporeon> 12Back
<SilverMane> 0Kill her now!
<Ghosties> So is that it?
<RobotPinkie> I'm actually having Pepsi right now...
<Sathi> What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
<SilverMane> 0no kill Bartholio prick
<Pegacorn> So,by saying that RobotPinkie,you prove that you are drunk.
<SilverMane> 0now*
<Sumica> where is you shield now huh?
<Sathi> I see no USP
<RobotPinkie> I guess so, Pegacorn
<SilverMane> 0he has M Shield
<Sathi> But the thing is
<Sathi> he has the hub
<ValtheJean> let him die LET HIM DIIIIIIE
<Sathi> that's a HUGE USP
<RobotPinkie> but M Shield is not against physical attacks, right?
<Pegacorn> inb4 Obvious event.
<SilverMane> 0ValtheJean, you're CN, aren't you
<RobotPinkie> or am I making too many JRPG assumptions here...
<ValtheJean> Chaotic Neutral? Oh in that DnD thing we've been doing. Yeah
<SilverMane> 0i mean you in general
<Sathi> oh yes and USP is Unique Selling Point ;)
<ValtheJean> well I can't go about telling you stuff like that, it ruins the fun :P
<SilverMane> 0Robot Pinkie, M. Shield halves all spells (heaing and damage)
<Nick> wb Vaporeon
<Vaporeon> 12Thanks
<Sumica> Short of scheduling more events or atleast posting the events in a more timely mannor not much. So far as i knew there were issues fiting in all the fans in channle as it is.
<SilverMane> 0Shield halves all melee
*Nick gives Vaporeon to Insane_Lugia
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, a lot like FF then
<SilverMane> 0indeed
<RobotPinkie> except there it's barrier and whatever
<SilverMane> 0right
*Vaporeon takes sushi back :<
<ValtheJean> Shell and Protect, or Barrier and Shell if it's older ones
<SilverMane> 0Shell and Protect
<ValtheJean> but yeah :P
<RobotPinkie> I'm liking this game more and more
*Pegacorn places his fronthoof on RobotPinkie's elbow,somehow sensing that he's incredibly drunk.
<Nick> MY SUSHI!
<SilverMane> 0right
<Nick> RAWR!
<EdwardNewgate> That purple 5'o clock shadow. IT'S TAUNTING ME
<SilverMane> 0lol mardek
<SilverMane> 0why you no strong yet
<ValtheJean> nooooooo not you too RobotPinkie!
<ValtheJean> I used to respect you!
<Sathi> Any other ideas?
<Pegacorn> ?
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<ValtheJean> oh hey, the sound died
<ValtheJean> nm
<RobotPinkie> as long as I can skip the story, I'm fine with this game
<Insane_Lugia> for them of you that wana see. i just took a picture of Yoshi to share her with you guys :) <script src='http://img842.imageshack.us/shareable/?i=unledlg.png&p=tl' type='text/javascript'></script><noscript>[URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/842/unledlg.png/][IMG]http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/5073/unledlg.png[/IMG][/URL]</noscript>
<SilverMane> 0so Prince-Dari, does the music not come through for us when you have mic on?
<Insane_Lugia> oops wrong link
<Insane_Lugia> http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/5073/unledlg.png
<RobotPinkie> or well, I don't mind dari reading the story, that's funny :P
<ValtheJean> if you listen closely, you can hear it in the background
<Insane_Lugia> k cya later takeing her for a walk
<Nick> heh np
<SilverMane> 0ah
<SilverMane> 0RobotPinkie, you CAN skip the story, but as it develops, it becomes very involved
<Nick> o.o oh wow I was expecting a yoshi plush or something xD
<Nick> nice lizard!
<ValtheJean> oh, I can't wait :-/
<SilverMane> 0considering chapter 3 is at least a 25 hour game, stretching to over 60 if you go for full complete
<RobotPinkie> well, that's not exactly appealing to me, SilverMane :P
<Nittany_Tiger_> What game?
<SilverMane> 0Barrier Break, he has Barrier on
<Pegacorn> I think my ability to sense how drunk somepony is comes from my former drinking when a horrible event happens to me.
<SilverMane> 0shield, even
<RobotPinkie> I mean having lots of content is fine, but having that much story is... I dunno.
<RobotPinkie> I'd rather watch LotR
<SilverMane> 0it's a full length RPG, Robot Pinkie
<ValtheJean> well you wouldn't be able to hit hard too if you had a giant anal dwelling spirit in you!
<SilverMane> 0but this is chapter 2
<Ray> 02THIS GAME
<Ray> 02HATES ME
<Ray> 02TO DEATH
<Sumica> Not really. You seem to have a good thing going here so far. YOu have a good following but it takes a good portion of the day for a movie night and such. Spreading it to othere nights might be a good idea but might just spread the viewership out too much.
<SilverMane> 0ValtheJean, lol spoilers bro
*Ray cries
<ValtheJean> spoilers? that happened in like the first 10 seconds of the game!
<Nittany_Tiger_> What game?
<RobotPinkie> >read dwelling as drilling
<SilverMane> 0nice Vehrn. Nice
<Pegacorn> So,RobotPinkie.....what are you seeing in front of you?
<SilverMane> 0The game we are watching, Nittany_Tiger_
<SilverMane> 0Mardek RPG
<Nittany_Tiger_> Oh.
<Ray> 02Y MoF HAETS MEH SO MUCH
<Nittany_Tiger_> Oh, that one.
<RobotPinkie> A hoof, pegacorn?
<SilverMane> 0and now for epic battle over dialogue
*Sathi is not impressed so far
<ValtheJean> wait wait wait...you didn't kill them?
<Pegacorn> Maybe RobotPinkie.
<RobotPinkie> wat?
<SilverMane> 0i love Aalia
<RobotPinkie> "My me hurts"?
<ValtheJean> DAMN YOU DARI AND YOUR PACIFISM!
<Sathi> Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
<RobotPinkie> I just remembered... I never played through both the NWN expansions
<RobotPinkie> due to game ending bug in the first one
<Sumica> pleas tell me at some point you get to kill them.
<Pegacorn> Now what do you see?
<SilverMane> 0i played NWN, but my file kept getting corrupted
*Pegacorn is close to RobotPinkie.
<RobotPinkie> OH GOD PUT THAT THING AWAY, PEGACORN!
<SilverMane> 0Sumica, you fight them several times, but they are key characters later
<ValtheJean> Indeed Durgarr, the same way you can think you're a parody when you're just poorly written
<SilverMane> 0even stop being pricks at one point, too
*RobotPinkie runs for the hills
<Pegacorn> WOAH!
<Pegacorn> WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
<SilverMane> 0i love how she can LOL speak
<ValtheJean> also delayed time because I had to log into my photobucket
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/Preview.jpg
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<Dermathil> alright, I'm going to play STALKER for now.
<SilverMane> 0lol ValtheJean
<SilverMane> 0Ohyes
<SilverMane> 0bye bye Dermathil
<SilverMane> 0Also more sex. Ohyes
<Nick> which game Ray?
<ValtheJean> gbye dermathil
<EdwardNewgate> Help us Jesus. I help those who help themselves
<RobotPinkie> Kill some... things for me, Dermathil, and cya later
<Ray> 02Touhou 10: Mountain of Faith
<SilverMane> 0i can't wait for Prince-Dari to find some chocolate milk
<Nick> oh yeah touhou
<Nick> the vids alone is impossible to watch!
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/ZoigbergCookies.jpg
<SilverMane> 0It restores 1000 HP and cures the 8 common ailments. Of course the name is a euphanism
<RobotPinkie> I have NWN patched now, though, so it should be fine.
<Pegacorn> Wut SilverMane?
<SilverMane> 0wut Pegacorn?
<Ray> 02Nah, I'm used to the bullet hell thing
<Ray> 02BUT IN THIS TOUHOU
<ValtheJean> I keep trying to play NWN, but it aalways seems to crash on me unfortunately. Same with the second one too
<Sumica> Not all that sure my self. Guess somthing just clicked seemed like a enjoyable place to be and see/ help flourish. Even if I dont have any solid ideas as to how we can do it yet.
<RobotPinkie> for what, SilverMane ?
<Ray> 02DEATHBOMBING IS IMPOSSIBRUUUU
<Pegacorn> This:<SilverMane>: Also more sex. Ohyes
<Pegacorn> WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
<Sathi> halp
<SilverMane> 0that's part of the description for Chocolate Milk
<SilverMane> 0oh, that Pegacorn
