<Luna> 07,01I was included
<Zephirdd> Mufasa voice is smexy
<Zephirdd> who is the VA?
<TheMaster> He's james earl jones.
<Scorchman1337> Simba's voice is sexy!
<Saturn`> i think i preferred it without this song
<Scarthceroth> is that a girl singer?
<TheMaster> you would know him better as Darth Vader or Thursa Doom (from conan)
<Sumica> yeah this was defenatly not in the movie when I saw it.
<SuperBrony64> What's it for?
<Lasharus> Doesn't make the film any worse, really. It just feels a bit surplus.
<Saturn`> except for the puns
<The_Si> Same.
<Fenr> killing the bird runs in the family i guess
<Saturn`> i love the puns
<Luna> 07,01it's just a song
<Fluttershy`> 08,01o-o

<Zephirdd> HOLY SHI-

*Saturn` stops worrying and loves the song
<Zephirdd> mindblown
<TheMaster> he also did an awesome job as King Lear in a shakespeare play
<kirzstryfe> chat crash >.<
<Tovler> except for the human poachers
<Sumica> was not worried, was just unexpected.
<Scarthceroth> ohoho
<Lasharus> :(
<Scarthceroth> simba is such a tool
<SuperBrony64> 10,2So, it's bad for Hyenas to hunt in pride land and it's good for the Lions?
<FlaschenJoe11> Remember this for later
<Scorchman1337> Hyenas are not worthy!
<Fenr> tempting fate at his best O_o
<Sumica> exactly SuperBrony64
<FlaschenJoe11> Scar is a Monkey's uncle
<deliopen> RACIST!
<herospirit> ...HAHA I SNUCK IN
<The_Si> "Quit rubbing it in, you little brat -_-"
<deliopen> Sorry, had to :3
<TheMaster> Scar is a lion version of che guevera. Bringing Hyenas freedom through revolution
<EspyLacopa> Reverse psychology!
<Rainbow-Dash> Not so fast Herospirit
<The_Si> VIVA LA SCAR
<SuperBrony64> 10,2herospirit: YOU!! Where's your ticket stub?!
<Scorchman1337> opsies

<GabeMoist> YFW Arrested Development is getting a new season

<SuperBrony64> 10,2I'll trust you…for now...
<Saturn`> OM
<herospirit> I uh. Left it outside, so no one would steal it.
<Saturn`> LiCK
<Scorchman1337> Dat tongue!
<Pegacorn> WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME?
<The_Si> An uncle saying "it's our little secret" is creepy in this day and age.
<VioletVanilla> 06It is for Fluttershy to go in and stun the rest of the chat members with her shyness and beauty and stuff~
<TheMaster> the question of the day is. who is nalas father
<[ger]Brony1> Dat plot-lick
<Scorchman1337> I am the father!
<CriticKitten> Da wata ho'? Wat so great 'bout the wata ho'?
<FlutterHuh> "My body is ready!!!"
<EspyLacopa> Zazu!
<FlaschenJoe11> checked on Wikipedia, Scar's birth name was Taka
<Fenr> kill the bird:still the best plan
<kirzstryfe> this scene in the lion king video game, pure evil
<Arentius> best song ever coming up
<SuperBrony64> She's not even in there :3
<Scarthceroth> hehe

<Sumica> colorshift
<EspyLacopa> Song time!
<Zephirdd> there is one better in this movie still
<kirzstryfe> most disney games are
<Scarthceroth> what about kingdom hearts?
<kirzstryfe> doesn't count
<Arentius> it was easy
<Scarthceroth> specifically 2 cause the first one sucked
<Lasharus> Uhoh.
<Arentius> kingdom hearts 2 was a sad excuse compared to 1
<Arentius> ....
<fluttercry> Nala is rainbow dash
<Lasharus> A debate on which game's the better of the two? :P
<Tovler> nala wub woo
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Lasharus> This can only end well.
<Scorchman1337> I am mad jelly of their singing voices xD
<Sumica> was taht dashes so awsome face?
<Scarthceroth> i enjoyed the combat more in 2
<Scarthceroth> 1's felt too clumsy
<The_Si> Getting video game flashbacks.
<Arentius> what? Mash Triangle to win everything?
<Lasharus> It's ALMOST as non-controversial as a debate on the quality of Sonic games.
<The_Si> RAAAAGE.
<FlaschenJoe11> Count me out! Out of Service! Out of Equestria!
<Zephirdd> lol Si
<Lasharus> Oy you two, that'll do! :P
<EspyLacopa> Wish Disney movies still had musical numbers.
<Zephirdd> you're not alone
<Zephirdd> :D
<Arentius> :P
<Scarthceroth> lash that doesnt count
*kirzstryfe whispers to Lasharus, "Should I mention the gameboy version?"
<Pegacorn> (Anyways,i'm bored.Seeya all some other time!)
<Saturn`> is this a new verse?
<TheMaster> they did make a pretty good one with the frog princess
<Luna> 07,01nope
<Lasharus> What, Chain of Memories?
<Scarthceroth> WE DONT TALK ABOUT THAT
<TheMaster> but that really only happened because racism
<kirzstryfe> hehe
<Lasharus> Neat story, clunky execution.
<Scarthceroth> TABOO
<Arentius> it didn't exist...
<Luna> 07,01princess and the frog was amazing :)
<Lasharus> Oh shut up.
<Scorchman1337> I love all Disney movies!
<Saturn`> i hated this level on the game
<Arentius> like the mythical 3rd matrix film
<Luna> 07,01Also.. how about I up the quality a bit?
<Arentius> there was no such thing
<Scorchman1337> Tangled made me cry xD
<Scarthceroth> TABOO
<Arentius> all propaganda
<Lasharus> Story-wise it worked. It was just bad gameplay.
<SuperBrony64> 10,2I hated this level in the video game :P
<Scorchman1337> Do it filly!
<Tovler> THE BLUE MONKEYS
<Zephirdd> if you can do that Luna
<Ziltoid> yes luuna
<TheMaster> I hated the video game: full stop
<Zephirdd> without streaming
<Scarthceroth> it also made no fricken sense
<Zephirdd> without stopping the stream
<Zephirdd> yesplz
<Zephirdd> :D
<Ziltoid> the video was hard as alls
<Lasharus> Actually, it's understandable.
<Luna> 07,01hehe .. I have to stop the stream a moment
<The_Si> K.O
<Kalisia> lol
<Scarthceroth> you have to remember to forget? memories how do they $&)($*# work?!
<Scorchman1337> Do it filly again!
<Luna> 07,01alright here we go
<The_Si> I never got past Level 2. :(
<EspyLacopa> Dat Rhino.
<Octavia> 13Dat rhino plot
<kirzstryfe> what didn't make sense of the mirror-world castle that existed above and below ground and stole your memeories?
<Zephirdd> I just can't wait to be king!
<Octavia> 13Is even biggesr than mine
<Zephirdd> ~~
<Sumica> OMG STRERAM!
<Lasharus> Well yes, but if you consider that, none of the Organisation makes sense either.
<Octavia> 13Inb4 impossible!
<Scorchman1337> Impossibru !
<Thunder_Dash> dat face
<Stefan> 3Y U PAUSE!?
<SuperBrony64> 10,2Good stopping point :P
<Scorchman1337> i didn't say impossible so =P
<deliopen> dat face! :D
<EspyLacopa> Smug cat.
<Scarthceroth> thats cause its a final fantasy game
<Arentius> best pose to pause
<Zephirdd> face = Bitch Please
<Scarthceroth> did the movie pause?
<Arentius> yar
<kirzstryfe> Luna did it
<Lasharus> No, that's because it's a Kingdom hearts game.
<Arentius> luna paused it
<Octavia> 13;P
<FlaschenJoe11> Octavia's Plot is still the most Glorious!
<Saturn`> and then the stream was no more
<Arentius> with her magic moon powers
<Lasharus> There're completely different writers behind it.
<deliopen> Bitch please, I'mma be king!
<SuperBrony64> 10,2Stefan: Why is your name Stefan?!
<Scorchman1337> Dat quality is so much better!
<Scarthceroth> still has a story like one...
<Zephirdd> Bitch please, I'm Simba
<Luna> 07,01and we're back
<Saturn`> <3
<FlaschenJoe11> Roleplaying
<The_Si> Smug Simba is smug.
<Scarthceroth> i think were getting side tracked
<Scorchman1337> inb4 massiv lag
<Flaria> Why hello Aloe~
*Flaria hugs Aloe
<kirzstryfe> disney games are bad because they're disney games, kingdom hearts is a final fantasy game with disney characters, different development
*Octavia is now known as... oh, wait...
<Zephirdd> cat fight!
<Scorchman1337> cat fight
<Luna> 07,01if it lags i'll switch back
<Zephirdd> ninjad
<Scarthceroth> doesnt make the story any less derpy
<Lasharus> I still quite enjoy Kingdom Hearts.
<Sumica> girl's on top =p
<Scorchman1337> GET OUT OF THERE!
<FlaschenJoe11> works fine
<EspyLacopa> Even makes sense that Nala keeps winning those little tussles.
<Saturn`> why does Nala have a southern accent?
<Scarthceroth> i recently played through KH2
<Saturn`> she sounds like AJ
<Octavia> 13She likes being on top..
<FlaschenJoe11> dem bone
<Lasharus> And really, the stories in the Final Fantasy games are of fairly good quality.
<Saturn`> but higher pitched
<kirzstryfe> I'd rate them above most of the regular ff games that have come out recently
<EspyLacopa> Remember who does the hunting in lion prides.
<FlaschenJoe11> dem bones
<Scorchman1337> they like it, kitty style ;)
<Zephirdd> Isn't her VA used on MLP as well?
<Lasharus> Some exceptions exist, of course.
<Luna> 07,01who does'nt
<Luna> 07,01:P
<Lasharus> 13 was an absolute goddamn atrocity.
<Flaria> xD
<Lasharus> I disliked 12.
<Flaria> Oh Luna~
<Luna> 07,01Evil luna!
<Arentius> who can't wait for 13-2 YAAAAY
<Arentius> -.-
<Sumica> omg Octavia and luna stop taking my mind there =p
<Scarthceroth> what like final fantasy 13: a movie disguised as a game?
<Lasharus> And (Arentius will kill me for this) 8 was horrid.
<Zephirdd> saucy Luna
<Octavia> 13Luna, you dirty litte... XD
<Saturn`> HAHA BANANABEAK
<Thunder_Dash> MR. BANANA BEAK
<FlaschenJoe11> Naughty Luna
<EspyLacopa> Mister Banana Beak. . .do you like bananas?
<Arentius> *twitch*
<Crickettwb> hahahaha
<Lasharus> Yes Scar.
<Scorchman1337> This i a kids movie, we don't need sauciness!
<Octavia> 13Hmm...
<fluttercry> Luna getting dirty. WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?
<kirzstryfe> 11 + 14 were online only so don't count, 13 was waaaaaay too linear
<Saturn`> oh simba, you so brave...
<Lasharus> I wrote a review on 13, actually.
<Zephirdd> dude I always say that line with the film
<Octavia> 13LunaxOctavia shipping.... goodness!
<Scarthceroth> taboo
<Thunder_Dash> Oh-kay, time to leave, methinks
<Zephirdd> EU RIO DA CARA DO PERIGO AHAHAHAHAHA
<Scorchman1337> Best ship ever!
<Lasharus> The summary: A 60-hour movie where you're allowed to press a button or two.
<Arentius> 8 was a fine game...the junction system was just too complicated
*FlaschenJoe11 likes Luna getting naughty
<Sumica> ..... i'll be in my bunk.
<Scarthceroth> 1 was the best
<Zephirdd> >yfw you didn't understood shit
<Lasharus> And the story was batshit.
<Arentius> once you got the hang of it it was fine
<Saturn`> GUINAN IS A HYENA!
<Arentius> ...the story was fine
<Lasharus> Sorry Alex, but there're too many bullshit plotholes.
<EspyLacopa> Growing up, I always thought Zazu was saying "Major Dodo". I now realize he was saying Majordomo.
<Aloe> 06ohmy
<Arentius> what do you expect with time travel where you talk to your child self?
<Thunder_Dash> WHO YOU CALLIN UPID-STAY
<fluttercry> puns
<Scarthceroth> uhh a paradox?

<Saturn`> the music is epic on my headphones
<bandgeek> The hyenas are Alex's droogs w/o Alex!
<Sumica> wait the ship sailed? Crap and i mised it.

<Scarthceroth> unicron but a femal
<Crickettwb> 0.o a birdy boiler.
<Lasharus> "yeah, I'll join a terrorist group for a random city I couldn't give a toss about because I want to spite my dad. Also, have this train-base"
<Arentius> the terrorist group had the train base
<Lasharus> Didn't the Galbadian army NOTICE one missing!?
<Arentius> she just used it
<Scarthceroth> QUIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEET!
<Lasharus> Riiight.

<fluttercry> dat black comedy
<FlaschenJoe11> Jeremy Irons! I WANT YOUR VOICE!
<EspyLacopa> mmm, wildebeest.
<Lasharus> Mostly because, having used Alex's strategy for it, you could break the one in 2 completely.
<Scarthceroth> but in kingdom hearts one you couldnt do infinite combos with berserk
<Lasharus> That's not clunky.
<Scorchman1337> jeremy iron cereal, there is no prize at the end of the box
<Lasharus> That's 'unbroken'
<Crickettwb> I'm so hungry, i could eat a wildebeest.
<FlaschenJoe11> dat "go" face
<fluttercry> dat chameleon dgaf
<Crickettwb> *rawr* = *yay*
<Tovler> Is "let's go" face a refernce to something?
<Zephirdd> STAMPEEEDE
<The_Si> I always wondered what that thing was when I was a kid.
<Scarthceroth> i honestly couldnt do it without berserk
<deliopen> Just being awesome Tovler.
<Thunder_Dash> Oh shi-
<fluttercry> The horror the horror
<Sumica> some one get AJ
<Scorchman1337> WE NEED AJ'S HEARDING SKILLS!
<FlaschenJoe11> WHERE'S APPLEJACK?!
<Saturn`> i love the use of voice in this soundtrack
<Scarthceroth> its freakin hard
<Scorchman1337> I'm too slow for everything, I quit Dx
<Zephirdd> lol
<Zephirdd> l2type
<The_Si> Wildebeest dun give a fuck.
<Zephirdd> :D
<Scarthceroth> considering one of his moves is a one hit KO
<Lasharus> After hearing Alex' strategy, Sephiroth was a pushover.
<Sumica> we cheat, Scorchman1337 we know the movie already.
<Arentius> sephiroth 2nd game?
<Arentius> took him out at lvl 30
<Tovler> Widebeest should have been one of the Teen Titans
<Scorchman1337> This is my first time =(
<Octavia> 13This part of the game make me rage sometimes.
<Zephirdd> Death, Betrayal
<Scarthceroth> liar
<Zephirdd> Child's movie
<Sumica> Like I said we cheet,
<Arentius> nope
<Zephirdd> ...
<Octavia> 13*made
<EspyLacopa> Herdmind.
<Scarthceroth> you cant fight him at level 30
<Saturn`> this was the first use of computerised flocking in film
<Lasharus> Sure you can.
<Scarthceroth> the final level is level 50ish
<Arentius> you can..it just usually ends in horrible death
<Crickettwb> scortchman1337 ZOMG wat? Awesome. Welcome to best disney movie.
<Zephirdd> I never completed the song part lol
<Lasharus> What of it?
<Arentius> if you dont kill anything you dont need to
<Arentius> you can get there low level
<fluttercry> pimp slap
<Scorchman1337> I was deprived as a child =(
<Nala> 06>yfw That is Mr. Bean.
<Lasharus> Low level games are doable.
<Scarthceroth> and i didnt grind at all and i still hit 50
<deliopen> Poor Zazu.
<EspyLacopa> Very poor Zazu.
<herospirit> Nala. WAT.
<Tovler> I had no NES or Genesis
<EspyLacopa> Everyone beats up Zazu.
<Sumica> nom
<Ziltoid> GLOMP
<Zephirdd> Dat part now
<Dumori> Mulan is best disny movie
<Arentius> you need to anti grind
<Lasharus> Nope, but if you don't run away from fights, you barely grind, but you do hit around lvl 50.
<Dumori> this is second
<herospirit> That voice actor is Mr. Bean? :0
<Zephirdd> no, TLK is the best
<Tovler> *SNES*
<Zephirdd> Mulan was second
<Scarthceroth> seriously?
<Scorchman1337> I am best movie
<Scarthceroth> wow
<Zephirdd> >imo
<fluttercry> Let's get down to business
<Arentius> if you just ignore everything but bosses and forced fights
<Scarthceroth> i dont think i want to do that
<Arentius> but yeah
<Nala> 06Zazu is Rowan Atkins, Ja.
<The_Si> Home on The Range. trollface
<Lasharus> It's not necessary.
<Scarthceroth> that sounds aggravating as hell
<CriticKitten> ;_;
<Scorchman1337> Grab my paw mufasa!
<Saturn`> Nala: no he's not? really?
<Arentius> reflectega when sephiroth does his fire pillar
<Scorchman1337> nope.avi
<Arentius> cast it 2/3 times
<Sumica> ADVENTURE!
<herospirit> There's only one way he could do that voice.
<Luna> 07,01meanie!
<Lasharus> But beating Sephiroth is simply easy. Abusing Reflectga and you're done.
<deliopen> nope.avi
<Arentius> you'll wipe out about 6-7 hp bars each time
<Ziltoid> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<FlaschenJoe11> LONG LIVE THE KING!
<Zephirdd> Long Live the KING
<Crickettwb> http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
<herospirit> Magic *snort* *snort*
<Scarthceroth> aww thats dumb
<[ger]Brony1> Hail to the King!
<Dumori> The king is dead Long live the KING
<Arentius> then its just dodge everything until he casts it again
<Scarthceroth> thats cheating
<Nala> 06http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/
<Lasharus> Yup.
<Zephirdd> damn I cried at this part
<CriticKitten> That big....dumb....MEANIE
<Denied_Existence> 3Looks like he failed his climb roll
<Nala> 06Ja he is.
<Arentius> then hit him with a combo to finish him off
<Arentius> just unequip all combo boosters
<Lasharus> No, that's breaking the fight with standard mechanics.
<Saturn`> cool!
<Arentius> 3 hits done
<Scorchman1337> Lmao I actually clikced the no button xD
<deliopen> LOL Crikettwb
<FlaschenJoe11> it's just not fair *sniff* you know?
<Lasharus> The Kingdom Hearts 1 version of the fight was infinitely more complex.
<The_Si> Arrest those wildebeest
<Scarthceroth> pff id rather just berserk his health down and have a REAL fight
<Saturn`> rowan atkinson is amazing
<Saturn`> have you ever seen his stand up?
<Dumori> nah I'm not watching this 2 times in a day
<Lasharus> Having around about 4-5 phases, as I recall.
<Sumica> daddaddaddaddad.
<Scorchman1337> Gonna pass out the tissues now =(
<Tovler> At least pixar movies still make you cry.
<Arentius> i did have a real fight...i just didn't realise people in SOLDIER were idiots :P
<Luna> 07,01we streamed mr Bean in the pre-show
<kirzstryfe> games have been getting dumbed down for years, just look at WoW
<Scarthceroth> again, aggravating as hell
<fluttercry> you probably thought Mufasa was real...Nope! Chuck Testa
<Lasharus> Uhoh.
<Lasharus> WoW debate.
<Ziltoid> DAAAAWWWWWWWW
<Scarthceroth> taboo
<Scorchman1337> omg no Tovler, Pixar movies make me bawl my eyes out
<Saturn`> i can't stand Mr. Bean
<Zephirdd> Fuck I am crying right now
<Crickettwb> He is deaded.
<Scarthceroth> TABOO
*Dumori is sad he missed preshow now
*Nala has seen him live when she went to visit Oxford.
<Lasharus> You'll excuse me, I'll go sit in a corner now.
<Zephirdd> I am supposed to have grown up
<SuperBrony64> 10,2The moment that has been imprinted to the hearts of millions of viewers :(
<Saturn`> but i like pretty much everything else rowan atkinson has done
<EspyLacopa> The circle of life!
<Zephirdd> after the miilion times I've watched it
<Nala> 06His stand up is funny.
<deliopen> That noo button ruined this moment, I can't stop laughing
<CriticKitten> Did anyone get the license plate for that herd of wildebeest?
<kirzstryfe> not debated, just stating fact :p
<Lasharus> Yes.
*Saturn` saw Bill Bailey live in Edinburgh
<Lasharus> A debatable fact.
<Dumori> Rowan is a comedy god
<CriticKitten> 'cuz dere's been a hit-and-run
*FlaschenJoe11 can handle it once. But Twice a day? He just starts sobbing.
<Scorchman1337> okay we need a crying break =(
<Lasharus> Now stop that.
<Scarthceroth> TABOO
<kirzstryfe> hehe :D
<Dumori> so is Bill Bailey
<Lasharus> I know I'm too easy to drag into these kinds of discussions.
<Saturn`> rowan is a master of comic timing
<Tovler> HA! Nemo's mom died
*Zephirdd cries
<MoonDasher> That black bastard!
<Crickettwb> deliopen And now I can't stop laughing over your comment!
<Scorchman1337> WHY GOD WHY!
<Lasharus> Incidentally, anyone who states an opinion as fact in any discussion, I consider the loser of the discussion.
<Scarthceroth> i will eat this roast beef sandwhich
<Zephirdd> I AM SUPPOSED TO BE OVER IT AFTER THE 20TH TIME
<Luna> 07,01did you know.. this room is most chatty tonight?

<Luna> 07,01how come you feel random?
<Thunder_Dash> This is the first time I've teared up in a long time ;_;
<CriticKitten> Disney knows how to make me sob. :(
*herospirit is still giggling about the "noooooooooo" button
<Lasharus> I have no idea.

*Zephirdd noms Flaria's pizza

*Nala is wondering where Simba is right now.
<Flaria> Hey!
<Lasharus> Nope.
<EspyLacopa> KIll him.
<Arentius> newp
*FlaschenJoe11 initiates Group hug
<Lasharus> He's the Brit, I'm the Dutchy.
*Flaria takes her pizza back
<herospirit> I love this music.
<Lasharus> However, I sound more British.
<Scarthceroth> how positively not british of you luna
<Flaria> Hello Rainbow-Dash
<Arentius> and the first thing lash ever said to me was "piss off you git"
*Luna is a Dutchy too
<Rainbow-Dash> Hi
<Saturn`> just as he said "kill him" i got a message on reddit, so derpy said "i brought you a letter!"
<Lasharus> That was because you were whining at me being OP.
<Flaria> Zeph, this is my last slice! :(
<Sumica> kid's on a roll
<Fenr> i can flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy......ok,maybe not
<Rainbow-Dash> I have been here, just had to refresh the page
<Lasharus> Which I weren't.
<Arentius> No i said mages were op
<FlaschenJoe11> hey there T_T
<Tovler> still implying that Hyenas are dogs
<Arentius> its not my fault i was a noob
<deliopen> Sumica: DAT PUN
<Lasharus> ahhh, memories.
<Zephirdd> The last is always the best
<Zephirdd> NOM
<Scorchman1337> dat thorns!
<fluttercry> and then all the mood died
<Lasharus> In case you're wondering - we've had this debate before.
<kirzstryfe> couldn't tell ;p
<Arentius> many many times :P
<Zephirdd> Cactus butt FUN
<Scorchman1337> cactus butt! ha!
<Flaria> Cactus butt~
<Kalisia> I think they added theis part to stop the audience from crying.
<Lasharus> Well it's your bloody fault.
<Zephirdd> you think Kalisia?
<Scorchman1337> still crying
<CriticKitten> Yeah! It's probably a good idea to let the enemy run away without killing him!
<Sumica> unless you come back in 5 years way bigger then you are now.
<Zephirdd> yep
<Arentius> pfft
<kirzstryfe> pretty sure I've heard this debate before too, and not from you two ;)
<Arentius> just because i was wearing all whites and meleeing...
<CriticKitten> This plan cannot backfire.
<Kalisia> ^
<Crickettwb> ominous shadows are ominous.
<Sumica> nice moon luna
<EspyLacopa> So, in the course of these two years, why doesn't Scar get any off-spring?
<Luna> 07,01ty
<Crickettwb> THE DARKNESS SHALL RULE. . . . . . . .FOREVER!!!!
<Arentius> as a hunter....
<Zephirdd> Luna always has the best skies
<Zephirdd> fuck Celestia
<Scarthceroth> what.
<kirzstryfe> haha
<Scarthceroth> why
<CriticKitten> Espy: Three words: Lion King Two
<deliopen> Maybe he's sterile, EspyLacopa... ?
<Scorchman1337> Luna is best alicorn
<Zephirdd> and her bright cannot-look-at-it sky
<Arentius> i was a noob back in the day
<Arentius> because...
<Lasharus> He was lvl 26 or so.
<Scarthceroth> give me a time machine
<EspyLacopa> CriticKitten: There is no such movie.
<Arentius> lash was lvl 19
<Lasharus> Just started playing.
<Lasharus> Mind you, I was just as bad. Just better.
<FlaschenJoe11> Scar chose Nala as his mate (Stage Musical Version)
<CriticKitten> EXACTLY
<Ziltoid> Lauren faust is best alicorn
<Nala> 06Adult Simba is played by Matthew Broderick whom is also famous for Ferris Bueller's Day Off!
<Scarthceroth> im going to smack the younger you upside the head
<Arentius> he had decent gear for a start
<kirzstryfe> did he at least have a pet?
<Arentius> yes
<Arentius> i did
<CriticKitten> And that's why Scar never had kids.
<Saturn`> http://veggie55.deviantart.com/art/Number-1-Fan-261403457
<EspyLacopa> FlaschenJoe11: So, Scar's a pedo?
<Luna> 07,01So who is gonna try guildwars2 ?
<Lasharus> I think so, yes.
<Arentius> i wasn't that stupid
<Lasharus> Probably on passive.
<Crickettwb> critickitten there's only 1 and 1 and a half
<kirzstryfe> ME! :D

<Lasharus> Not me Luna. I'm still enjoying WoW. I really can't afford another MMO impinging on my time.
<Sumica> get in the car
<Luna> 07,01I was dissapointed in GW1
<Arentius> I'm moving to swtor
<EspyLacopa> Yes, the Vultures were going to eat Simba.
<kirzstryfe> gw2 is shaping up to be so much better than gw1
<Scarthceroth> i might but im playing vindictus
<Luna> 07,01but GW2 looks promising
<Arentius> oh definately
<Saturn`> it's lion!
<Crickettwb> Lol, it's a little lion. A white lion.
<Octavia> 13Horey shet its a car! Get in the lion!

<Zephirdd> nice Saturn`
<Nala> 06Yes, get in my belly~ >D
<kirzstryfe> swtor is too much like wow for my taste
<kirzstryfe> which one is ss3?

*Saturn` climbs up Zephirdd's nostril

<Luna> 07,01Serious Sam (BFE) best friends ever
<Arentius> mythic did fantastic in WAR just need a decent class design
<CriticKitten> Crickettwb: Yeah. I'm glad they never made any sequels. Just like with the Matrix.
*Zephirdd doesn't know wat a nostril is due to non-nativity on English
<Fenr> O_o
<Scorchman1337> Trying to load that comic and now my stream is derping up xD
*Kalisia is depressed
<Sumica> *rimshot*
<Luna> 07,01noooo
<Thunder_Dash> "I mean he's depressed." "Oh."
<Ziltoid> HAHAHHAHA
<Saturn`> timone and pumba are hilarious
<Lasharus> I already said I'd pick it up Luna. :P
<Luna> 07,01why did you do that Scorchman1337!
<FlaschenJoe11> The Lion King is copied from Kimba The White Lion, if I remember correctly
<herospirit> It's the hole in your nose, Zeph. :0
<Kalisia> Timon is a dick
<EspyLacopa> Who wants bacon?
<Luna> 07,01goodie good!
<Zephirdd> LOL.
<herospirit> Holes. Plural
<Scorchman1337> Idk, I'm sorry Luna D'=
<CriticKitten> You gotta your behind in your pass.
<Lasharus> I had my faith in GW2 shaken when they announced with much hoopla that you could JUMP in this one.
<CriticKitten> *put your
<Crickettwb> Critickitten: The only Matrix movie i've ever seen was the last 15 minutes of the last movie. I don't know why everyone hates it. I thought it was awesome. I need to see the first though.
<herospirit> I'm.... not sure why he's invading your nostril
<Luna> 07,01can you fly?
<Scorchman1337> brb, dad is cutting the internet for a second
<Luna> 07,01:o
<Sumica> put your plot behind the past
<Lasharus> Not in RL, no. :P
<Arentius> yup
<TheMaster> So timon and pumba are rosecrantz and gulderstern?
<Arentius> i has jetpacks
<Luna> 07,01yay

<CriticKitten> Mostly because it makes no sense, Crickettwb :P
<Fenr> and here comes history
<Luna> 07,01I know in WoW...
<MoonDasher> akunamatata
<Ziltoid> inb4 best song
<Zephirdd> Crickettwb: the first movie was so much better than the other two, that people hate them
<fluttercry> yes TheMaster
<CriticKitten> (but then, none of the trilogy does)
<MoonDasher> :D
<Lasharus> Well, if we're talking in our personae Alex, then yes, I can fly.
<Luna> 07,01Still have me LK drake..
<TheMaster> except, not stooges of scar/claudias

<Luna> 07,01I was talking about GW2
<Lasharus> Same here Luna.
<Lasharus> I have no idea if you can in there Luna.
<Arentius> i don't even know what my persona is...

<EspyLacopa> ...Timon just shaved off one of Simba's claws. Do those grow back?
<kirzstryfe> in GW you just push the city's button and you're there, beats flying
<Luna> 07,01ik stonk altijd een uur in de wind
<Scorchman1337> gross
<CriticKitten> Yes.
<EspyLacopa> Oh, good.

<EspyLacopa> Which means I have to do a bunch of questing in the outlands to get access to the dungeon the key itself is in.
<Octavia> 13Oh goodness... online translators, lawl
<Luna> 07,01You won't need keys for the crypts..
<kirzstryfe> I remember those days, when you needed keys and quests to actually raid

<CriticKitten> ....you know, that was actually a really good analogy.
<Dumori> and I can'ty think of a funner moive than that for the 5th
<Arentius> too easy ^^
<Ziltoid> YEAh
<Lasharus> Cretin.
<Arentius> i have my moments but come on
<Zephirdd> indeed CriticKitten
<Luna> 07,01so yea.. what do you like about Cataclysm and what not?
<CriticKitten> Smacking him with the stick, that is. I never realized how perfect that was. *appreciation +1*
<deliopen> inbr D:
<Octavia> 13I got the Brewfest kobo on my druid this year... and I have it on acouple 80s too, cant remember which tho... lol
<deliopen> *inb4
<Arentius> cataclysm is what caused me to eventually quit...so yeah :P
<Fenr> *stroke*
<Octavia> 13I mean my DK
<kirzstryfe> disappointing :(
<Arentius> not much love there
<Luna> 07,01yep me too..
<deliopen> inafter inafter inb4
<Lasharus> it does many things right, but equally many things wrong.
<Arentius> though wotlk was the worst
<Octavia> 13But my DK also has the Big Love Rocket, and thats my mount of choice. ;)
<Nittany_Tiger> I am disappointed. Can't find a Discord shuffling gif animation.
<Luna> 07,01I never expected I would quit WoW...
<Lasharus> I don't think the problem is with Cataclysm specifically, but more with the game's age.
<fluttercry> yo dog i heard you liked being in
<Thunder_Dash> Rafiki is G-Monkey
<Crickettwb> Hey guys, the king has left the building.
<Arentius> its not even the games age
<Lasharus> I feel it is.
<Arentius> its the mentality of the playerbase
<Sumica> Who's on first?
<Arentius> the game is fine
<Octavia> 13Cata made the game a little harder than Wrath at least.
<deliopen> http://www.discodiscord.com/ <Nittany_Tiger
<Lasharus> That's definitely true.
<EspyLacopa> I'm prone to taking several month long breaks in between a month of playing.
<Zephirdd> wasnt Scar the uncle of a Monkey?
<Arentius> but everyone wants everything for free
<Octavia> 13Wrath was stupidly easy.
<Flutterz> IM FRIST LOL
<CriticKitten> Epic run music.
<Arentius> which was wraths fault
<deliopen> YOUR FRIST LOL?
<Crickettwb> RUNNING SEQUENCE GO
<Luna> 07,01I loved the LK fight
<CriticKitten> I want to exercise to that music.
<kirzstryfe> wotlk needed more ulduar
<Flutterz> YA I FRIST U JELLY?
<deliopen> And yes, *you're.
<Arentius> I think TBC was the best in terms of difficulty/accessability
<FlaschenJoe11> If the Monkey's Simba's Uncle and Scar's a Monkey's Uncle. WHO IN THE PRIDE MARRIED A MONKEY?!
<Luna> 07,01and the vid at the Wrathgate
<Nittany_Tiger> Awesome deliopen. Thanks.
<deliopen> YA I JELLY
<Octavia> 13Ulduar... that was the best one in Wrath.
<bandgeek> If he's in the desert?
<Fenr> so,did scar throw a nuke on pride land?
<deliopen> Sure thing, Nittany.
<Luna> 07,01Yea, I agree
<Kalisia> "Let's get down to business..."
<bandgeek> Wouldn't he be running the wrong way?
<Zephirdd> lol
<Arentius> oo wrathgate chain was my favy
<kirzstryfe> it had more than 2 difficulty levels on most of the fights, made it a lot more challenging
<Octavia> 13The cinematics too, all nicely done.
<Fenr> kind of hard to change it this way in another way
<Nittany_Tiger> But it's not a downloadable .gif
<Flutterz> everyone below the line is jelly because Im frist

<Lasharus> And you're not entirely right about Mass Effect.
<Ziltoid> EEYUP
<Crickettwb> Gah my beautiful band-aid!
<Fenr> oh god
<CriticKitten> Best song.

<Lasharus> The best game ever from Bioware is Baldur's Gate II.

<Crickettwb> yupyupyup
<Nala> 06OI

<Flutterz> tasty swine!
<EspyLacopa> Have the Forsaken ever actually made true reparations for the plague stuff they've done?
<Luna> 07,01yep

<MoonDasher> BOOM
<Crickettwb> My ringtone for the longest time.
<Saturn`> :(){ :|:& };:
<Lasharus> Throat.
<CriticKitten> xD
<Scarthceroth> WHATEVER IM TIRED!
<EspyLacopa> I wants bacon.
<Lasharus> For heaven's sake, if you plan to threaten me, do it right.
<kirzstryfe> with a spork
<Lasharus> I do have standards you know, I don't just let ANYONE threaten me.
<Octavia> 13Eh, I think people will start loosing more and amore interestin in WoW before Blizzards like "lets just pull the plug"
<Arentius> a rusty spoon!
<Arentius> oh definately
<SuperBrony64> 10,2Somehow…somewhere…my evil twin is trying to destroy me...
<Arentius> i mean numbers are rapidly dwindling atm
<Scarthceroth> i will slit you're throat and bring you to a world where pain is god and I am the pope.
<Arentius> though i think it's steady atm
<Octavia> 13Yeah, WoW is already loosing its players a little bit
<Flutterz> \m/_ d^_^b _\m/ rock
<Arentius> scar you are not pinkie
<CriticKitten> Bitchslap
<Zephirdd> Scar is stupid lol
<Ziltoid> OH HE MAD
<EspyLacopa> Let's be fair, they're kinda running out of villains in the game.
<FlaschenJoe11> Scar: From Strategic Mastermind to Pussycat. OH HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN
<bandgeek> breakin out da pimpin hand
<Luna> 07,01Well.. to be honest.. I hate activision
<kirzstryfe> they have killed most of them
<Arentius> yup
<Arentius> activision ruined wow for me
<Luna> 07,01yep
<Octavia> 13Its still massive of course, but yeah, its loosing a little at a time now
<Arentius> they also buggered up the guitar hero franchise
<Flutterz> Imba
<Scarthceroth> did i threaten you with proper mechanics lash?
<Arentius> they just flog the horse until it dies
<Arentius> then flog it some more
<kirzstryfe> it's not just activision
<Sumica> James: no Willam: no :bill: no
<Lasharus> Many companies are good at that.
<Luna> 07,01it's shareholders too...
<Lasharus> EA.
<kirzstryfe> can't blame half the company :p
<Lasharus> UbiSoft.
<Zephirdd> Tell me why shouldn't I kill you RIGHT NOW
<EspyLacopa> I think there's the head titan in charge of the Burning Legion (I don't think he's been killed yet), and I know there's still some Old Gods kicking around.
<Zephirdd> - Jim Raynor, Twilight Sparkle
<Arentius> EA didn't push out 11 incarnations of the same game in 1 year
<deliopen> :3
<kirzstryfe> sargares got knocked off in sunwell didn't he?
<Flutterz> yep
<deliopen> 'Twas a good game.
<Sumica> Pick now, die or die.
<EspyLacopa> Horde lost a lot of awesomeness when Thrall stepped down as warchief.
<Lasharus> Nah, that was Kil'Jaeden Kirz.
<Arentius> he didn't "die" i think
<Luna> 07,01Thrall will be back
<Crickettwb> Violence solves everything. Psh, go for it.
<Luna> 07,01eventually
<Lasharus> And he didn't die, he merely got banished back into the Twisting Nether.
<Zephirdd> was? SC2 is a fucking awesome e-sport
<Zephirdd> :|
<Arentius> thrall didn't leave...he's just taking care of the deathwing problem
<Rainbow-Dash> I pick the second option Sumica, its obviously the one where you fail to kill me.
<Luna> 07,01But Garrosh.. I hate that guy...
<Flutterz> LIES
<EspyLacopa> Thrall did step down as warchief.
<Octavia> 13Garrosh is such a hardass lol
<Luna> 07,01I do love my little gobbywobby though
<Lasharus> Garrosh is a tit.
<EspyLacopa> Granted, if he comes back and tells Garrosh to piss off. . .
<kirzstryfe> they did that to push more of the alliance/horde pvp side of it
<Lasharus> And I'm not very fond of the Goblins, if I'm honest.
<Octavia> 13But I'm not familiar with the deeper Warcraft lore
<FlaschenJoe11> NO EVIL GLOATING!
<Lasharus> At least the Horde Goblins.
<bandgeek> dat fire
<Thunder_Dash> SUDDENLY LIGHTNING
*EspyLacopa likes the Draenei.
<FlaschenJoe11> IT'S ONE OF THE OVERLORD RULES!
<Zephirdd> suddenly fire
<Luna> 07,01hehe
*Luna wonders why
<Lasharus> The Steamwheedle cartel makes sense. The Horde Goblins seem a little TOO comically bad.
<Nala> 06Dat fire
<Zephirdd> suddenly lava
<Octavia> 13Alliance... eww
<Arentius> space zoidbergs
<Lasharus> "We pollute because!"
<kirzstryfe> I think one of the old gods will show up in the last raid of the xpac, sunwell style
<Flutterz> dat puzzle
*Octavia she says as shes on her Worgen DK
<Lasharus> "because what" "JUST BECAUSE!"
<EspyLacopa> Space zoidberg paladin here.
<Crickettwb> PLOT TWIST!!!!
<Nala> 06I~
<Nala> 06Killed~
<Lasharus> They're like bloody Captain Planet villains.

<Ziltoid> THEGREAT SHITSTORM OF OUR TIME
<Arentius> (yay leper gnome slaves)
<Zephirdd> LIONS VS HYAENAS
<Zephirdd> better than ninjas vs pirates
<Arentius> oh i just bubbled
<Crickettwb> Haha, bowling sound effects are comical.
*Luna is a hordy at heart
<Flutterz> awesome
<Crickettwb> NINJAMONKEY
<Zephirdd> NINJA MONKEY
<EspyLacopa> Blood Elves are magic addicts that are finally starting to fix their addiction.
<deliopen> Zephirdd: But not as good as RBD vs Starscream :3
<Flutterz> Monkey-Fu
<Arentius> Nelf Hunter of 4 years human pally of 2
<Octavia> 1331k dps, hawt
<Dumori> not as cool as Ninja Rarity
<Flutterz> yes
<Zephirdd> RDB vs Starscream is 1v1
<Arentius> palla tanks were so OP
<Zephirdd> Ponies vs Transformers should be epic
<Crickettwb> Are you, talking to me?
<Luna> 07,01this chatter makes me miss WoW more...

<Zephirdd> made me love Pumba for ever
<Arentius> there'd be 2 moons for you to control there luna
*Octavia pats Woona gently
<Arentius> you can't handle it! :o

<Octavia> 13Yeah. :/
<kirzstryfe> fishing was more entertaining
<deliopen> SLOWMO CATFIGHT
<Lasharus> The only reason I finally gathered 20 rares was purely to get the Professor title.
<EspyLacopa> I just liked flying around with my netherdrake.
<Saturn`> inb4 he gets his face burnt off
<deliopen> IS BEST CATFIGHT
<Luna> 07,01oh looky another useless item

<Octavia> 13My Big Love Rocket owns all
<Luna> 07,01lol
<Flutterz> look!

<Scarthceroth> uh oh i have a problem
<Dumori> that's how it is with them
<Flutterz> time...
<Flutterz> TO DIE
<EspyLacopa> I'll have to send it over to a new character then.

<Flutterz> RAAAAAWR
<Lasharus> In which country are we talking?
<Scarthceroth> canadia
<Lasharus> Ah.
<Dumori> untill the FiM film
<Lasharus> Fun.
<Zephirdd> I spent a whole week watching it stopping only to eat and sleep
<Flutterz> inb4 RAWR
<Scarthceroth> its not passed yet
<Arentius> USA + canada but they want it global iirc
<Lasharus> Naturally.
<Arentius> though i read about it like..10 months ago
<Crickettwb> Pink pajamas pengins on the bottom. . .
*Luna hugs Zephirdd
<Arentius> so i dunno how its changed
<Zephirdd> when I was 7
<Arentius> but it'd affect everyone
<Tovler> ;-;
*Zephirdd hugs Luna ~yay~
<Lasharus> It's the US proposing a law. Of course they want it global.
<Crickettwb> d'aww
<Lasharus> (sorry, that was a bit crude of me, wasn't it? :P)
<Arentius> its to "end piracy"
<Scarthceroth> they are still fighting it, but its probably going to go through
<Arentius> however
<Ziltoid> dat title card
<Thunder_Dash> I forgot how amazing this movie is
<Fenr> simba cloning factory:100% working
<Saturn`> and then EVERYPONY CAME
<Crickettwb> :'(
<Flutterz> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<deliopen> Wait, are you putting that one Robbin Williams movie on again?
<Arentius> if i was to livestream playing a videogame (like many pros do)
<Luna> 07,01not gonna happen
<Lasharus> Piracy can't be stopped.
<Flutterz> or am i too late?
<Arentius> i'd be breaking the law
<Scarthceroth> videogames are ok
<deliopen> http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
<Scarthceroth> just movies and tv
<Luna> 07,01yep
<Arentius> not in the original bill i read about
<Arentius> it was to include games
<Flutterz> :(
<kirzstryfe> that's because most people in my country are idiots and believe their ideas are right for everyone else
<Scarthceroth> apparently its been ammended
<Arentius> thank fuck for that
*Nala did a Disney movie marethon once where she watched every one up untill The Emperor's New Groove in a four day span.
<Scarthceroth> also videogames count as art which you cannot copyright
<Crickettwb> Deliopen: YAY! Spread the Joy!
<Nala> 06Dat Elton
<Scarthceroth> but apparently movies and tv dont
<Luna> 07,01people will always find ways...
<fluttercry> i don't think we had lag during the robin williams one
<kirzstryfe> ^
<Arentius> well its like that woman from the UK
<CriticKitten> The worst part of The Lion King is the fact that it's over now. :(
<Zephirdd> dat song
<deliopen> we didn't really have lag.
<Lasharus> That makes perfect sense Scar.
<EspyLacopa> Better hope they don't try and tell that to Ebert and Roper.
<Arentius> wanted all BDSM porn made illegal cause her daughter was killed by a man who watched it
<bandgeek> ELTON JOOHHHHHNNNNNNN!!
<Luna> 07,01so you guys happy?
<Dumori> no that was shiny
<Crickettwb> I didn't have any lag.
<Arentius> because it "clearly deranged people"
<Zephirdd> It was smooth this time
<CriticKitten> Very <3
<fluttercry> very happy
<Lasharus> Smooth woman.
<Zephirdd> FUCK its 10pm already
<Crickettwb> ONE MORE TIME!!
<Dumori> V. happy Luna
<Luna> 07,01goodie

<Saturn`> fuck, it's 2am
<Zephirdd> I... want to skip classes tomorrow

<Saturn`> i have uni tomorrow
<Octavia> 13Spoiler: I used to think he said "bag of bones" in this song when I was little o.O
<Dumori> I should food
<Crickettwb> Wat. It's 6 here.
<Lasharus> There are infinite ways to bypass this sort of idiocy.
<Scarthceroth> if only it wasnt the government
<Luna> 07,01lol
<Arentius> fool the interwebs into thinking you're in a different country
<Luna> 07,01Octa!
<Saturn`> god, i was meaning to get stuff done this weekend...
<Crickettwb> 6pm
<Lasharus> It never worked, and it never will work.
<Nala> 06ohmy~

<Dumori> damn it
<Turtaguin> CAAAAAN YOU FEEEEEL THE LOOOOOVE TONIIIGHT
<Octavia> 13Kings and bags of bones.. lmao
<Lasharus> Know why?
<Nala> 063:04AM here. . . x.x
<Dumori> yeah I can't even recall when I last ate
<Scorchman1337> I'm back and I must say damn, that movie was amazing! and yay rlthon John I have that song
<Lasharus> The lawmakers are the passives in these cases.
<Flutterz> 9:04 pm here xP
*Flaria huggles Nala
<kirzstryfe> people on the internet are smarter than people writing laws?
<EspyLacopa> Huh, the Tier 3 Raid set isn't available in the game anymore?
<Luna> 07,01Don't worry too much
<Flaria> You should sleep soon o.o;
<Lasharus> Pirates find a way to circumvent what the lawmakers want. They react.
<Lasharus> Then pirates act again.
<Scarthceroth> except if anyone else in the house realizes im using that kind of proxy, which will technically be used illegally, ill get the tar kicked out of me
<Crickettwb> LEEEVE THUH PHAROAH DEADD. . .. .
<Luna> 07,01there's this thing called: Internet Freedom
<Lasharus> And no Espy.
<Lasharus> It was lost with Old Naxxramas :(
<Arentius> luna it no longer exists
<Luna> 07,01it does
<Scarthceroth> internet freedom wont stop them from shutting off my internet
<Arentius> people have been prosecuted for anonymous blogs
<Arentius> and were incarcerated
<Octavia> 13Internet... freedom?
<Crickettwb> I still don't know what that lyric actually is.
<Luna> 07,01Well I don't support anonymus
<Arentius> for voicing their opinons
<Octavia> 13Yoi mean NOT being on the internet at some point?
<Arentius> ...not the group anonymous
<Octavia> 13SLANDER!
<TheMaster> that doctor whooves animation
<Nala> 06Kings and Begavonds
<Arentius> they have a blog (like wordpress)
<Arentius> and no link to the real them
<Luna> 07,01alright guys.. breaky time
<MoonDasher> 2 INTERMISSIONS?
<Lasharus> Don't feel alone there Luna.
<Arentius> and they said they hated some actress
<Lasharus> I rather like how a friend of mine put it for Anonymous.
<Luna> 07,01actually this is number 3
<Nala> 06Dyslexia
<Arentius> and the actress sued the guy
<Nala> 06Vegabonds
<Nala> 06D:
<Crickettwb> Look! It's Ed!
<EspyLacopa> Ah, that's why I wanted to do Molten Core. . .I wanted to pick up the Tier 2 paladin set for customizing.
<Arentius> and she won
<Scorchman1337> Whats on after the intermission?
<Lasharus> "The difference between helping and Anonymous:
<McGoerk2> Derpy is roomates with the popcorn again
<MoonDasher> Why are there 3 intermissions?
<Flaria> Begavonds~ <3
<Luna> 07,01Because this is a re-stream
<Arentius> i have no food
<Lasharus> Helping: Hey business. Your bulletproof vest has a weakness, you might want to fix that.
<Arentius> and am hungry
<Lasharus> Anonymous: *BANG*"
<Arentius> ....pot of nutella hoooooo
<Luna> 07,01Bronies in the US had terrible lag issues earlier today
<kirzstryfe> lol
<fluttercry> not for the second movie
<MoonDasher> oooh
<Arentius> the worlds problem is
<Luna> 07,01So I decided to re-stream everything
<fluttercry> we're fine really
<Crickettwb> Kay, now I think i'll start on the report due tomorrow. Toodles to you all!
<Arentius> if they are going to say "I have an unbeatable system"
<Lasharus> It has humans on it?
*Nala probably can not watch the second movie again. .
<Scorchman1337> Thank you Luna!
<kirzstryfe> because Luna is best pony
<Arentius> someones gonna go "LOL NO YOU DONT"
<Nala> 06No more tears left ;A;
<CriticKitten> Indeed. :D
*Luna hugs Nala
<Scarthceroth> regardless, unless i find a way to secretly use this proxy and not get caught, im screwed
<Arentius> they then say "prove it"
<Arentius> SCAR I HAVE IT
<Arentius> I'll watch the livestream
<EspyLacopa> http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/226195.jpg
<Scorchman1337> I'm glad for the restream or else I would've never known how amazing this movie was xD
<Arentius> and share my screen with you
<Luna> 07,01I don't think so.. people will always find ways
<Arentius> mwahaha
<Luna> 07,01but we'll see in due time I guess
<CriticKitten> Yeah, it really is.
<Luna> 07,01alright brb
<Scarthceroth> that would work, if my comp wasnt broken to hell and couldnt run screen share
<Luna> 07,01refilling my glass
<Arentius> espy just use the transmogrifier
<FreezeFrame> What Dreams May Come is a good one, too.
<Scarthceroth> *could
<CriticKitten> Wish there were films these days at this caliber.
*Viola hugs Luna back~
<CriticKitten> Just doesn't happen as often.
<Arentius> right seriously time for a spoon and nutella brb
<EspyLacopa> Arentius: I know. But you have to own the item that has the appearance you want as well as the item you're changing.
<Arentius> ahhh i didn't know that
<Arentius> fail :(
<Lasharus> Put it this way Scar - these laws are only to scare off the dumber pirates.
<Lasharus> When you get right down to things, they're practically impossible to actually enforce.
<fluttercry> poor Luna forsaking sleep for our entertainment
<Scarthceroth> but what if they do?
<Zephirdd> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/164d67207770fc7ac4ee9531da4096cd/66561%20-%20artist%3Amadmax%20celestia%20comic%20craig_mccracken%20lauren_faust%20luna%20woona.png
<Zephirdd> OMFG
<Scarthceroth> you cant tell me its impossible, because its not
<Scarthceroth> its improbable
<Lasharus> I just strongly doubt they would.
<Scarthceroth> but possible
<deliopen> LOL SUPERMAN CROSSOVER
<EspyLacopa> First step really is to remove anonymity on the internet.
<Scarthceroth> and as long as that possibility exists i have a problem
<Zephirdd> >YFW that's Lauren Faust OC as the mother
<deliopen> But what about luuuuuuuunaaaaaa
<Lasharus> Put it this way: If you watch a stream of copyrighted content, you could get sued?
<Scorchman1337> well imma head out guys, need to study for macroeconomics, later guys and gals
<kirzstryfe> lol, just saw that one
<Lasharus> Do you know how many lawsuits that would result in?
<Scarthceroth> no, they will shut off my internet
<deliopen> cya scorchman1337
<Scarthceroth> its apparently a 3 strike thing
<Lasharus> Even that would be hard to get through.
<Saturn`> is jonathan coulton coming over the stream, or is it just me?
<Scarthceroth> but still POSSIBLE
<Lasharus> Internet companies wouldn't like to lose about 50% of their customers.
<Scarthceroth> ill be right back i have to empty my garbage
<Lasharus> Because enormous amounts of people WILL watch streams regardless.
<Saturn`> okay, it's just me
<Saturn`> i have no idea how that turned on
<Viola> 06JoCo~ <3
<Saturn`> have you heard his new album?
<kirzstryfe> especially if ponies are involved
<Viola> 06o:

<Arentius> bacckkk
<Lasharus> Wb.

<Saturn`> yup
<Saturn`> just released
<Luna> 07,01and back
<Saturn`> it's called Artificial Heart, and has some awesome songs
<Lasharus> From what I know, they've actually stated that they don't mind.
<Arentius> indeed
<Dumori> x3
<kirzstryfe> they haven't endorsed it, but they haven't banned it, which is what you'd expect if they were going to allow it
<EspyLacopa> Huh, there's a recolored version of that tier 2 set in BC heroic dungeons. . .
<Lasharus> I know.
<Lasharus> There's also a mage T1 recolour, which I own.
<Lasharus> I also own the Warlock T2 recolour.
<Lasharus> I'm a mad collector :P
<Arentius> obsessed collector*
<Lasharus> (18 sets and counting)
<EspyLacopa> Heh

<Luna> 07,01yep...
<deliopen> :D
<Sumica> Top gun was the first vhs I ever saw =p
<Scarthceroth> and so our numbers dwindle
<CriticKitten> Heh, bad SyFy movies are only good for hanging out, rarely for romantic nights. xD
<kirzstryfe> actually we're back to 10, same as when I got here
<Lasharus> :P
<FreezeFrame> Actually, we enjoyed it
<Luna> 07,01Also...

*Luna smiles at Viola
<Scarthceroth> but what is your team colour
<Lasharus> I was talking about the fact that you're marked as having Twilight as your favourite pony on the 'about' page Luna.

<Lasharus> It's nice to have active mods in this channel btw. :)
*Lasharus hugs Luna and Octavia.
<EspyLacopa> Heh, Silverscreen's favorite movie was Lion King.
<TyeDyeBrony> Dear Celestia, what the heck am I watching
<deliopen> So just DEAD then?
<Octavia> 13I hope some actually try for the DA Art Competition >.<
<Sumica> yep dead
<Luna> 07,01yep
<Octavia> 13I'll be sad if we get no entries. :(
<Thunder_Dash> That's... one /hell/ of a car accident, flying through the air like that
<CriticKitten> Awful way to die. Just trying to help someone else. :(
<Scarthceroth> my chat just froze up
<Ziltoid> nope locked in syndrome
<Lasharus> Don't look at me Octavia, I'm afraid I have no drawing skills whatsoever :(
<Luna> 07,01there will be
<Luna> 07,01give it time!
<kirzstryfe> I'll be putting something in, just have to get an idea first :p
<Octavia> 13Awww. XD
<Ziltoid> oh god blurry nacked people
<Lasharus> I should really try my hand - or hoof - at writing again though.
<Scarthceroth> just remember
<Scarthceroth> infamous 2 is mine
<Octavia> 13I'm patient, I'm patiant! Dont I look patient! *big grin*
<Tovler> The car didn't even screech its tires
<Tovler> no horn
<Scarthceroth> i will write infamare
<Luna> 07,01eeeeenope
<Octavia> 13D:
<Octavia> 13>:|
<TyeDyeBrony> "Doc"?"Time doesn't count"? Dear god he's in a dream sequence with doctor who
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
*Octavia AJ poker faces
<deliopen> lol
<Scarthceroth> evil karma twilights story must be told
*Octavia plops AJ hat on
<Lasharus> If I write a crossover, it'll probably involve Robotnik.
<Lasharus> Though someone was there before me :(
<Scarthceroth> just to kill off zeke rainbowdash
<Lasharus> (good fic though, that)
<Tovler> he just saw the ramp and Robin Willians and said Challenge Accepted
<Scarthceroth> was i the only one who played infamous 2?
<Lasharus> Possibly.
<Scarthceroth> so nopony is going to get it when i write infamare?!
<FreezeFrame> One of the hardest conversations to have with your child.
<Lasharus> More or less :(
<Sumica> Tovler, acheavment unlocked.
<kirzstryfe> played the first one
<Scarthceroth> but infamous 2 is so much better!
<Lasharus> Sorry Scar, but I can't play EVERYTHING.
<Scarthceroth> sigh
<Flutterguy> I had that conversation twice. I know.
<kirzstryfe> and is also still $60
<Ziltoid> rainbow
<Flutterguy> Double* rainbow.
<Sumica> it's easyer if the kid has a fish
<deliopen> Both my pets died within the last year ;_;
<Scarthceroth> so nopony will feel sad when zeke dies?
<Lasharus> Who's Zeke?
*Thunder_Dash hugs deliopen
<Sumica> they get mad if you try to flush any thing fluffy.
*Flutterguy hugs deliopen.
<CriticKitten> Heh, death discussion is very difficult. :/
<Scarthceroth> the main characters best friend
<Ziltoid> brohug
<Saturn`> my cat died just over a year ago
<Saturn`> but i have a new cat now
<kirzstryfe> scam artist
<Scarthceroth> he betrayed him for powers then risked his life to try and save him
<Saturn`> unfortunately, i have also developed cat allergies...
<Flutterguy> Deliopen, both my dogs died within 2 years. I know the feeling too.
<Scarthceroth> and in infamous 2 hes doing all he can to make things right
<Scarthceroth> they reconcile about 80% through the game
<deliopen> I had a dog and a rabbit, the rabbit died in the last month.
<Scarthceroth> and in evil karma
<deliopen> Also, thanks guys
<Scarthceroth> you have to kill him
<Lasharus> Oh good. A moral choice system.
<Flutterguy> Of course.
<Scarthceroth> except you have become attached to him
<Scarthceroth> so you feel really bad
<Scarthceroth> now imagine that
<Scarthceroth> but with ponies
<CriticKitten> My dog died while I was at college. We arranged to have her put to sleep at a time that I could be there. It's always really tough. *hugs deliopen*
<Scarthceroth> with twilight as cole macgrath, the electric mare
<Thunder_Dash> I know what it's like, too - my family usually has three or four cats, so I'm used to dealing with it, as sad as it is to cope with, or to say
<Lasharus> Oh yes, now I recall.
<Saturn`> my mother killed my cat by accident
<Scarthceroth> the demon of epiyah ponyville
<deliopen> wait, what saturn`?
<Saturn`> the cat could only eat through a syringe and was on her way out anyway
<Lasharus> I saw a Zero Punctuation on that.
<deliopen> oh
<CriticKitten> Oh wow. :(
<Scarthceroth> well yahtzee hates everything so shush
<Luna> 07,01sooo what did I miss?
<Saturn`> my mum was trying to feed her, but the cat choked on the food
<deliopen> my rabbit was like that, till we put him down
<Sumica> that's depressing.
<Luna> 07,01was dealing with kitty litter...
<CriticKitten> That'd make me cry, trying to feed my kitty like that.
<kirzstryfe> Scar's infamous 2 rant
<Scarthceroth> just me marking my territory for infamare
<Lasharus> I don't take Yahtzee as actual reviews Scar, I'm not THAT thick.
<kirzstryfe> with ponies
*Flaria hugs all the sad ponies
*Thunder_Dash hugs Saturn`
<Octavia> 13I just love the face she gets when shes lieing... hilarious.
<Scarthceroth> i claim the fanfic
<Scarthceroth> its mine
<Saturn`> i have pictures of it :(
<Lasharus> He tells us what he dislikes in a comedic manner.
<Lasharus> Nothing wrong with that. I love his style, in fact.
<Saturn`> derpy just brought me a letter!
<Ziltoid> :'(
<EspyLacopa> Yahtzee didn't hate Portal.
<Scarthceroth> ITS BUCKING MINE!
<Sumica> yeah I am done watching this chat for some time till the mood gets better.
<Luna> 07,01he did?
*CriticKitten hugs Saturn` too, and everypony else for good measure.
<deliopen> My rabbit tried to refuse to eat and drink. It's terrible when they won't eat and drink.
<Lasharus> And he was remarkably positive about the last two games he reviewed.
<Scarthceroth> dont touch
<Lasharus> I wasn't planning to Scar...
<Scarthceroth> mine...
<Ziltoid> 6_9
<Lasharus> You sound like Rarity in greed-mode.
*Flutterguy hugs all around
<Lasharus> "MIIIINE"
*Luna hugs everypony
<Scarthceroth> id be so mad if someone stole it from me
<Lasharus> Mmhmm.
*Luna tries to cheer up everypony
<FreezeFrame> :(
<deliopen> I do suppose it's time to change the subject, I'll agree with Sumica.
<Lasharus> I don't play the game, nor do I particularly want to, so the likelihood of me doing that are low, at best.
*Viola hugs everypony tightly
*kirzstryfe pulls all night writing mode, steals fanfic.
*Thunder_Dash hugs everypony
<kirzstryfe> :)
<Scarthceroth> :'(
<Viola> 06It will be okay~
<Flutterguy> That's a good idea..
<Scarthceroth> ...
<Viola> 06Shhh shhh~
<Scarthceroth> :[
<Lasharus> Nyahahahaaa!
<Saturn`> right on cue, my cat has come and sat on me
<Thunder_Dash> Also, yeah, I agree with deliopen and Sumica
<Saturn`> and now i can't breathe
<Lasharus> Sorry, my Robotnik-fanboyism leads me to break out in evil laughs every once in a while.
<Lasharus> It's a tic.
<Saturn`> thanks cat
<Saturn`> that.
<kirzstryfe> don't worry, I can't write that fast unless I get some really good inspiration
<CriticKitten> Yeah. Always get mushy-eyed when I talk about my doggy. Best move to another topic. ^_^;
<Luna> 07,01Well...my cats just went to the litterbox...
<Sumica> It's a cat thing they know when you feel down.
<deliopen> http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
<Scarthceroth> i dont think ill be complete until i write infamare
<kirzstryfe> and I'm more in the picture side of things than writing
*Luna giggles
<Flaria> SO MUCH SAD ;___;
<Viola> 06My cat would run across my keyboard
<Sumica> curently i have 3 cats naping on me.
<Lasharus> Then get on with it Scar. :P
<Luna> 07,013?
<Luna> 07,01oh my!
<Luna> 07,01pic?
<Sumica> yes
<Luna> 07,01must see that!
<Flutterguy> Wow Sumica.
<Lasharus> I have no drawing skills Kirz, writing's more my forté, as it were.
<CriticKitten> Ick. Wrong thing to do, Robin Williams.
<Scarthceroth> i need to get the game again
<Scarthceroth> i have to get it down to a tee
<Sumica> one is on my legs one is on my lap and one is on the back of the chare I am siting on across my sholders
<Luna> 07,01that's soooo cute!
<Luna> 07,01I just have one sleeping behind my monitor now
<Sumica> yeah but I want a drink and cant feel my legs
<deliopen> Did anypony here bid on that giant plushy?
<Luna> 07,01hahaha
<Scarthceroth> down to the nitty gritty
<Scarthceroth> even the scar
<Lasharus> That's up to you.
<CriticKitten> Hehe. My kitty's ...somewhere. Hm. I should look for 'im.
<Lasharus> I'll stick with what I know.
*Flaria huggles herospirit
<Flaria> You~
<Luna> 07,01How many you have Critic?
<pony_1757> woiw
<TyeDyeBrony> AAAAAAAHHHHHHH
<Ziltoid> AHHHHHH
<pony_1757> what is he doing?
<pony_1757> hunting her?
<CriticKitten> Just the one. He keeps me busy enoug....oh, there he is.
<CriticKitten> He wants uppsies.
<Scarthceroth> also, if anyone can find me a twilight sparkle version of cole, you get a shoutout
<Fenr> and this is how they had the idea of paranormal acticity
<Sumica> some how i think you could pay some one 5g to make a better rainbowdash.
<kirzstryfe> ...
<kirzstryfe> now I'll have to make one >.<
<Viola> 06I love cats
<Luna> 07,01me too
<Viola> 06I love every kind of cat
*CriticKitten felt the paws tapping his legs to ask for permission to get on his lap. xD
<Scarthceroth> thanks
<Viola> 06I just want to hug all of them but I can't
<Viola> 06can't hug every cat. . .
<FreezeFrame> I prefer dogs

<Lasharus> Sorry, I tend to hug a bit much. I'm clingy.

<Sumica> hate having paint all over me.

<Luna> 07,01this movie is good.. even in higher quality
<Lasharus> Oy oy oy!
*kirzstryfe hugs Luna, laughs at Scar
<Flutterguy> Just to go there, stand, and admire the scenery and the landscape.

<Lasharus> (Mind you Clearance IS granted, but really now)
<TyeDyeBrony> look closely, you'll see canterlot on that mountain o'er there

<Flutterz> heaven is best zealand
<Lasharus> D'aww :)
<Lasharus> BTW Luna, despite me not being allowed to link stuff here, did you check the link I linked regardless?
<Flutterguy> Add New Zealand and Iceland to the places I wanna go.
<Nittany_Tiger> New Zealand has too few tornadoes.
<Scarthceroth> youre not allowed to link?
<Scarthceroth> i am
<Lasharus> (I reserve the right to relink it if you didn't)
<Luna> 07,01in the post-show you may link
<Lasharus> Well, I was only allowed links related to the film at the time, according to Luna.
<Scarthceroth> huh
*Viola is SO TIRED D8

<Scarthceroth> my bad
<Lasharus> The combination of my two fanboyisms.
<Flaria> You need to sleep /*SOMETIME*/
<Luna> 07,01lol
<Lasharus> It's FANTASTIC!
<Viola> 06Never! >~<
<Flaria> Dual Controls :3
<Lasharus> Well isn't it? :P
<Scarthceroth> ya it is
<Rainbow-Dash> Viola could go lay down, but she wont fall alseep >.>
*Luna sings a lullaby for Viola
<Viola> 06Why do you say that Rainbow-Dash? >:
<Lasharus> The fanfic for that one is actually quite good.
<FreezeFrame> Cogito ergo sum
<Flaria> mfw I eat a pizza, then mother comes home with more food and I keep eating
<Scarthceroth> the one posted recently?
<Lasharus> Yup.
<Scarthceroth> ah
<kirzstryfe> it's on the big list of fanfics I still have to read >.<
<Lasharus> But then, again I'm a relentless Robotnik-fanboy.
<Thunder_Dash> If heaven is conjured by the imagination...
<Lasharus> I know how THAT is Kirz...
<kirzstryfe> it keeps getting bigger 6_9
<Lasharus> Yup.
<Flaria> I'd have the biggest server farm. xD
<Scarthceroth> hey kirs quick question
<Lasharus> This is an astoundingly productive fanbase.
<Thunder_Dash> ... Can I make myself a pony?
<Flaria> Biggest LAN games ever.
<Luna> 07,01so where did this Robotnik fandom come from?
<Lasharus> The Sonic games.
*Flutterguy brohoofs Flaria
<Lasharus> And Robotnik doesn't really have a fandom.
<CriticKitten> Yes.
<CriticKitten> Yes you can.
<Lasharus> I'm just a fan of the character.
<Scarthceroth> kirz were you serious when you said youd make me a picture?
*CriticKitten thinks this heaven is best heaven.
*Flaria brohoofs Flutterguy
<kirzstryfe> might take a bit, but I put it on my list of pics to make
<Lasharus> The main fanbase is the Sonic fanbase. But at least Robotnik is more than a paper cutout character, in my view.
<Scarthceroth> yuuuurrr
<Flutterguy> Flaria, have massive LAN games of Quake, Doom, Battlefield, etc.
<Lasharus> A while ago, a friend of mine challenged me to do a full raid and use ONLY Robotnik quotes whenever I had something to say.
<kirzstryfe> I use the same name on deviantart if you want to find the stuff I've made
<Lasharus> Pulled it off too. Four hours. Wasn't easy. :P
<Rainbow-Dash> Because you have to much energfy to fall asleep Viola
<Flaria> Flutterguy: I love you for saying DooM. <3
<Rainbow-Dash> Energy*
<Luna> 07,01back in good old nax...
<Flutterguy> Only because Doom is amazing!
<Scarthceroth> ok
<Luna> 07,01we had a GameMaster joining us
<Thunder_Dash> no Half-Life? ;_; *hit*
<Lasharus> That happened in the earlier days of WoW Luna. Fun occurrences, usually :)
<Luna> 07,01yep
<Flutterguy> Half-Life too.
<Flaria> It was included under ect.
<Luna> 07,01and I loved the Safety dance
<Thunder_Dash> Ah. :P
<Lasharus> Think I annoyed my GM with my Robotnik quotes...
<kirzstryfe> robotnik is a pretty good character
<Lasharus> Usually when he was explaining tactics.
<Lasharus> "Enough of this nonsense!"
<Lasharus> Yes Kirz. Yes he is.
<kirzstryfe> has had a lot more development compared to most of the other characters
<Flaria> Flutterguy: Have you heard of Skulltag/ZDaemon?
<Lasharus> Yyyup.
<Flutterguy> Heard of it, but I haven't actually looked into it.
<kirzstryfe> but I used to read the comics, get more from those than the games alone
<Lasharus> The Archie series?
<kirzstryfe> yeah
<Lasharus> Still read those.
<Scarthceroth> hey kirz how do i search up a deviants name?
<Lasharus> Robotnik FINALLY got over having gone completely insane, rebuiilt the death egg, and pretty much WON.
<kirzstryfe> kirzstryfe.deviantart.com
<Sumica> v tec just kicked in.
<Flaria> Skulltag is DooM+, ZDaemon is DooM enhanced, ZDooM is like ZDaemon, but it's coming along better IMO
<Lasharus> Have to admire that, no?
<Scarthceroth> this will do nicely
<Flutterguy> Sounds pretty sweet!
<kirzstryfe> haven't read the series since around issue 200 I think, but yeah, he gets around
<Flaria> Skulltag adds stuff like weapons and runes, ZDaemon and ZDooM just enhance the original DooM
<Lasharus> Yeah, he goes mental in issue 200.
<JC_Denton> what film is this?
<Luna> 07,01Kirz
<Lasharus> Takes him 25 issues to regain his mind. So a little over 2 years.
<Flutterguy> JC_Denton What Dreams May Come
<Lasharus> *urgh*
<kirzstryfe> ?
<Flaria> What Dreams May Come
<Flaria> Dang. xD
<Luna> 07,01you should totally submit something for the contest!
<Lasharus> :)
<FreezeFrame> It's a beautiful movie
<Flutterguy> Ninja'd :D
<kirzstryfe> pay attention, I've said I will be :p
<Flutterguy> It's very beautiful.
*Luna blushes
<Lasharus> Be nice to Luna.
<kirzstryfe> :D
*Lasharus hugs Luna.
<Luna> 07,01Sorry head full of ponies!
<FreezeFrame> It will also make you B'AWWWWWWWW
<JC_Denton> i was just playing daggerfall
<Flaria> IDE, Internet Doom Explorer is my favourite DooM server browser, but ZDaemon and Skulltag have their own browsers
<herospirit> When... did I get here.
<herospirit> When did I log in. :I
<Flutterguy> When DID you get here herospirit?
<Flaria> herospirit: 'bout 10 minutes ago
<herospirit> :I
<kirzstryfe> that is acceptable then :)
<Scarthceroth> so much pony for a stream that has streamed 2 pony things today
<Flaria> Flutterguy: ZDaemon and Skulltag both have their own IRC servers, too.
<JC_Denton> is the lion king coming or did i miss that
<Sumica> Oh Hi hero
<Viola> 06Energy. . . x.x
<Lasharus> And about 173289321069 pony emoticons.

<Lasharus> Would you know that this does not come as a surprise Luna? :P
<Scarthceroth> ill be quick doont start the suprise without me
<Luna> 07,01exactly
<Luna> 07,01How come your lagging?
<Flutterguy> No idea, internet's just been.. weird today.
<Lasharus> Didn't we have the surprise already?
<Sumica> Time is an illiusion, lunch time doubly so.

<Luna> 07,01but I might be in the mood for some more nostalgia after this movie
<kirzstryfe> please tell me it was recorded

<Flaria> If by nostalgia you mean all of Samurai Jack
<Flaria> MY BODY IS READY

<Nittany_Tiger> My brother is using my PS3 and I'm doing work (slowly).
<Flutterguy> Samurai Jack was beastly.

<Sumica> I dont do first post.
<Viola> 06> mfw I hit 2 for her to switch to her pistol

*Saturn` just got his dad's air rifle
<Flutterguy> No.
<Saturn`> imma go hunt bunnies
<FreezeFrame> best MP shooter is still UT2k4
<Saturn`> though preferrably pigeons
<Flutterguy> ,,
<kirzstryfe> so what's G+?
<Saturn`> pigeon tastes nicer
<Viola> 06I will agree with FreezeFrame.
<Luna> 07,01Google +
<Lasharus> Google+, I assume.
<CriticKitten> BF3 certainly looks stunning. Haven't played though so can't say
<Lasharus> Bugger, just a bit too slow.
<Viola> 06but Flutterguy, BF3 is gorgeous.
<Viola> 06CriticKitten get into the open beta ;3
<Flutterguy> It is.
<kirzstryfe> ah, yeah, have that too
<Flaria> BF3 is indeed gorgeous.
<Thunder_Dash> BF3 looks interesting, but still not interested without Steam
<Viola> 06And we can go love each other <3
<Edward_Newgate> mfw my computer seems to hate BF3
<Lasharus> If you want to know who I am among your subscribers Luna, just look for the Robotnik Avatar. :P
<Flutterguy> Viola, origin name so we might play?
<Lasharus> (This should really not come as a surprise :P)
<Luna> 07,01Feel free to add us: https://plus.google.com/111173542573917460290/posts
*Luna can't see avatars in the subscriber list
<Lasharus> D'aww.
<Lasharus> Oh well. I'm Lasharan on YouTube.
<Luna> 07,01I did see that :P
<Lasharus> I've uploaded a massive one videos too.
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<CriticKitten> I'll need a better computer first. This thing....well, it sucks. :p
<LordCelestia> Hey, does anyone here use the PS# and have BF3 beta? we can play :D
<LordCelestia> PS3 *
<Flutterguy> LordCelestia, I have you added, remember? :)
<JC_Denton> how long till this movie finish
<FreezeFrame> It's a long one
<Luna> 07,01an hour
<LordCelestia> Oh, youre superhero right?
<Edward_Newgate> Wait, is that a girl?
<LordCelestia> or something?
<Flutterguy> I am.
<LordCelestia> Anyone else? we can all play or something. PS3 names
<CriticKitten> ....d'aw. Kitty asked for shoulder time. xD
<FreezeFrame> My PS3 is broken
<CriticKitten> (he likes to perch his little rump on my shoulder for some reason)
<Viola> 06Awwww~
<Flutterguy> This movie is depressing me a bit, but I don't wanna stop watching it! ;_;
<CriticKitten> Derpy. xD
<Flaria> Derpy!
<Lasharus> By the way, speaking for Robotnik Corp, Equestria has been officially whitelisted on the "worlds not to conquer" list.
<Sumica> when I gro up I wanna be asain
<CriticKitten> Sumica: xD
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Lasharus> Besides, that list is a bit pointless while that hyperannoying hedgehog still lives...
<kirzstryfe> so which exit off of the multiverse highway would equestria be?
<LordCelestia> Why wait?
<Flutterguy> *kicks to moon*
<Lasharus> i'm not entirely certain.
<Luna> 07,01it's ponyverse!
*LordCelestia kicks Sumica to Asain Land
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<Luna> 07,01ponynet & ponyweb
<CriticKitten> So hard to type with kitty on shoulder....
<Lasharus> I have high hopes for my HA Missile though.
<Lasharus> (Hedgehog Annihilator)
<Flutterguy> Coax kitty off of your shoulder?
<Lasharus> *Sir, launch failure. The missile detonated inside the silo. The setback will last for months!*
<FreezeFrame> Yes, that was a scar on her wrist.
<Lasharus> ...bugger.
<CriticKitten> Naw, he's comfy. I'll let him sit until he wants to get down.
<kirzstryfe> blame uncle chuck
<Lasharus> I'm well past that.
<Lasharus> He hasn't been part of the Eggman Empire for years.
<Lasharus> I can't rule out sabotage, of course.
<Sumica> cat owners will almost never displace a kitty
<Lasharus> (incidentally, if we're going by the actual Archie Canon here Kirz, I'm sitting on board the Death Egg II, having won)
<Lasharus> (more or less)
<kirzstryfe> won't last :p
<Lasharus> Highly likely.
<Luna> 07,01Can I borrow somepony to test something?
<Lasharus> But allow me my illusions, would you?
<kirzstryfe> sure
<Lasharus> Sure Luna.
<JC_Denton> can someone fill me in on the plot?
<Lasharus> Damnit, i wanted to be of help.
<Lasharus> :P
<kirzstryfe> lol
<kirzstryfe> everyone's dead
<Luna> 07,01Can you go to: http://bronymovienight.deviantart.com/ and comment on the BronyState Art competition?
<Sumica> Octavia's plot is best plot?
<Flutterguy> I would post a pic, but it seems.. inappropriate.
<Flutterguy> Sumica right?
<JC_Denton> *facepalm* nt what i ment
<Sumica> ok then yeah every one is dead.
<Lasharus> Done. :)
<Rainbow-Dash> Going to bed. Bye everypony
<Sumica> Night Rainbow-Dash
<Flutterguy> Bye RD!
<LordCelestia> Bye Dashie
<CriticKitten> There, he's down now. Flopped in lap. :p
<Luna> 07,01thanks
<Lasharus> And Kirz, replied to you on the wall :P
<Luna> 07,01what wall :o
<CriticKitten> Also, this movie is dark. ._.
<Lasharus> The main channel comments Luna.
<Lasharus> (I.e. the comments on the main DA page)
<Luna> 07,01ah yes.. thanks both!
<FreezeFrame> It's depressing, but it's still romantic
<Thunder_Dash> So wait, what happens if you're aware you're breaking the order of things but commit suicide anyways?
<Flutterguy> Not so much dark as.. deep.
<kirzstryfe> lol, yeah, reverse order between the 2 spots
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<Lasharus> Happy to assist Luna. :)
<Fenr> *cue gurren dan motto*
<Luna> 07,01I needed to make sure people were able to reply on it
<Lasharus> Ahh.
<CriticKitten> I suppose that's true, Flutterguy. Just....wow. o.o
<Lasharus> Right, where was I?
<Lasharus> Oh yes, cackling maniacally on board the Death Egg II.
<Lasharus> MWAHAHAHAHAAAA!
<kirzstryfe> lol
<MrChang> people flying
<MrChang> ITS HOGWARTS!
<Flutterguy> Hogwarts in heaven?
<Lasharus> Well, he did manage to literally shoot Sally.
<Flutterguy> WANT
<Lasharus> I wonder if she'll stay dead this time.
<Scarthceroth> im back'
<kirzstryfe> she's been dead a few times already
<Scarthceroth> what did i miss?
<Lasharus> Welcome back.
<Flutterguy> Now all we need is Quidditch, butterbeer, and the Whomping Willow.
<Lasharus> Nah, only once Kirz.
<Flaria> Flutterguy: Best LAN party is Hogwarts LAN party
<Lasharus> Then Sonic 'died' and returned.
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<Scarthceroth> any ground breaking plot twists?
<Lasharus> So did Knuckles, who ACTUALLY died and returned.
<Lasharus> Seriously, the Archie canon needs help. :P
<kirzstryfe> and then dropped his transcendant form
<Lasharus> Ah yes.
<Lasharus> He regains that though.
<Lasharus> Then there's Shadow.
<Flutterguy> Hogwarts LAN party with the characters(not the actors) is better LAN party Flaria :P
<kirzstryfe> test tube hedgehog
<Lasharus> Who probably died 2000 times by cutting his own wrists and rapidly healing.
<Lasharus> (Me? Dislike Shadow? Whatever gives you THAT idea?)
<Leadhoof> The voice of Skyrim again!
<kirzstryfe> lol
<MrChang> DOVAKLEEN
<Flaria> Depends on how long they've played video games, Flutterguy. xD
<Scarthceroth> MARIAAAA!
<Scarthceroth> im dom from gears of war!
<MrChang> FUS RO DAH
<JC_Denton> cant wait
<Leadhoof> HURRY UP NOVEMBER. GAWD.
<Scarthceroth> and im also an anthropomorphic hedgehog
<Lasharus> "Hi, I'm grim, gritty, completely one dimensional, and rather more angsty than should ever be allowed"
<Flutterguy> Easy kills Flaria, easy kills XD
<JC_Denton> 11.11.11
<Flaria> Flutterguy: True that xD
<Lasharus> Ever played Shadow the Hedgehog? Yes, he had a game.
<Lasharus> It was basically Sonic. With guns.
<Scarthceroth> "i also have a counterpart named shadow
<Flutterguy> How do I shot rocket? *dead*
<Lasharus> And vehicle sections.
<Scarthceroth> oho see what i did there?
<Lasharus> Shadow can break the SOUND BARRIER while RUNNING!
<kirzstryfe> that was a bad game
<Lasharus> Why the hell does he need a motor cycle!?
<MrChang> 111111
<kirzstryfe> goes with the black leather jacket
<Scarthceroth> one of the good endings he takes over the universe
<Flutterguy> 11.1.11 is the date I'm waiting for MrChang.
<Lasharus> He doesn't have a black leather jacket.
<Lasharus> He does Scar?
<Lasharus> Neat.
<kirzstryfe> he does now
<MrChang> im waiting for 10/25
<Scarthceroth> its a GOOD ending though
<kirzstryfe> because I'm on the internet and said so
*Flaria hugs FlutterBro13
<Flaria> Welcome back!
<Lasharus> I hate Shadow the Hedgehog even more for another thing.
<Flutterguy> That's a maybe.
<Flutterguy> Hey FlutterBro
<Lasharus> Robotnik actually DIES in a variety of the endings.
<Thunder_Dash> Hi FlutterBro
<FreezeFrame> >mfw I care less about ep 3 than ep 4
<MrChang> DEMENTORS
<Scarthceroth> yup
<Scarthceroth> which is dumb
<Lasharus> How they managed to reconcile all the bloody plot threads is beyond me...
<Scarthceroth> because there is only one
<Lasharus> And as with all the other Sonic games in recent history:
<Scarthceroth> all the other ones arent real
<Lasharus> The Voice Acting was SHIT. Except Robotnik's.
<CriticKitten> So.....Black Guy: "It's not hell." Proceed to explore a dark place with storms and devil creatures flying around.
<Scarthceroth> only the true ending is the real ending
<Flutterguy> >mfw I care so much about ALL of the episodes.
<Lasharus> Ah.
<Edward_Newgate> Really hopes this is what its like when he dies
<kirzstryfe> they play off all of the games as non-canon
<Scarthceroth> everything else is a false plot twists
<Lasharus> "Enough of this nonsense! The Chaos Emeralds belong to ME! All of them! Now move aside, or I WILL crush you!"
<CriticKitten> ....
<Luna> 07,01holy hell...
<Thunder_Dash> What.
<Flutterguy> This is now trippy.
<Lasharus> As opposed to Shadow:
<Sumica> funny luna
<Scarthceroth> fact sonic heroes was the sequel to shadow the hedgehog
<Flutterguy> Everypony! Stop CONSUMING SHROOMS.
<CriticKitten> Okay, how is that not hell?!?
<Scarthceroth> shadow the hedgehog was the sequal to SA2
<Lasharus> "Where's that DAMN chaos Emerald?" "Damn" "Damn!" "damn..."
<Scarthceroth> sonic adventure 2 sequel to sonic adventure
<Lasharus> And how often can one character get amnesia!?
<Lasharus> Seriously.
<Scarthceroth> well hell never remember that he did
<Lasharus> After the third time, you'd think Shadow would take a moment to write a goddamned DIARY.
<Saturn`> i wish i was good looking enough to have an attractive girlfriend ;(
<Scarthceroth> but he forgot he forgot
<Thunder_Dash> Well, I wasn't expecting that F-Bomb at all
<kirzstryfe> except he can't remember that he's had amnesia
<kirzstryfe> lol
<FreezeFrame> ummm
<LordCelestia> Oh my
<Flaria> Woona whut do
<Lasharus> Yeah, but he also remembers the times he forgot.
<JC_Denton> he was a good man what a rotten way to die
<Lasharus> So no, he's full of it.
<Edward_Newgate> WHATS GOING ON?
<Lasharus> And thick.
*Flutterguy brohugs Saturn`
<Lasharus> Very, very thick.
<Scarthceroth> heres the explanation
<Scarthceroth> MARIA!
<Lasharus> Thanks for that.
<Scarthceroth> DOM we gotta kill some locusts!
<Luna> 07,01Hmm?
<Lasharus> "Now to input the password... MA-RI-A. Maria!"
<Scarthceroth> but i have to find the chaos emeralds to save maria
<InsertCupcake> hi there u guiz
<Lasharus> I still wonder where Robotnik found a keyboard using two-lettered keys.
<Flutterguy> Hey Cupcake
<Scarthceroth> and another fanfic was born
<Thunder_Dash> Hi Cupcake
*Flaria hugs Saturn`
<CriticKitten> Saturn`: Eh, looks ain't everythin'. Had a good looking gf once, and she cheated on me, so.... :p
<Flaria> Hello InsertCupcake
<InsertCupcake> what are we watching?
<Scarthceroth> Kajeje
<Flutterguy> What Dreams May Come
<Lasharus> ...wot.
<Flaria> What Dreams May Come
<Luna> 07,01a re-stream of the mane movies
<Flaria> Dang, I must be tired
<Scarthceroth> Kajeje
*Saturn` shall lose some weight, then shall be sexy
<MrChang> JACK I LOVE YOU
<Lasharus> .........wot.
<Flutterguy> Flaria, why you no sleep?
<Thunder_Dash> > mfw thought he said "shit bricks" instead of "shipwrecks"
<CriticKitten> Haha.
<JC_Denton> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Dreams_May_Come_(film)
<Flutterguy> Thunder_Dash lol
<Lasharus> BTW, who here played Sonic 2006?
<Flaria> Flutterguy: It's only 10:21 xD
<Scarthceroth> taboo!
<Sumica> a slap in the face!
<kirzstryfe> was that sonic 4?
<Lasharus> And if yes, did you or did you not contemplate suicide?
<Lasharus> No, Sonic 4 was 2010. :P
<Flutterguy> Oh.. ._.
<Scarthceroth> i did
<Lasharus> Actually Scar, Sonic 2006 has two saving graces.
<kirzstryfe> werewolf sonic?
<Lasharus> Nah, that's 2009.
<Lasharus> 2006 was just an atrocity.
<CriticKitten> Yeah. 10:21 and yet I still feel kinda out of it. :/
<kirzstryfe> king arthur sonic?
<Flaria> I go to sleep around midnight but I get tired early...
<Scarthceroth> what could possibly save that abomination?
<Lasharus> But with, as said, two saving graces.
<InsertCupcake> its 3:22 here
<Lasharus> One:
<InsertCupcake> am
<Lasharus> Robotnik at least did reasonably well.
<Flutterguy> 8:22 P.<. here
<Denied_Existence> 3FlutterBro13!
<Flutterguy> P.M.
<Thunder_Dash> 7:22PM herew (PST)
<Thunder_Dash> *here
<Denied_Existence> 3Wo bist du?
<Lasharus> His plots were mental, but that's the story board going completely off the record. At least he pulled his role off.
<FreezeFrame> 10:22 here
<Lasharus> Two:
<Lasharus> He rebuilt Sonic Adventure's Egg Carrier!
<Luna> 07,01he's Fluttershy's brother
<Scarthceroth> they have interspecies romance!
<CriticKitten> Cerberus is a shipwreck?
<Lasharus> That ship was bloody AWESOME!
<Scarthceroth> that cancels out any saving graces!
<LordCelestia> How do I made sandvich?
<Lasharus> Noted.
<Lasharus> BUT!
<Revolver> Luna
<Lasharus> The Egg Carrier is awesome.
<Luna> 07,01yessems?
<LordCelestia> I haven't a clue
<Revolver> Wo means where
<Denied_Existence> 3Wo=Where
<Scarthceroth> interspecies!
<Denied_Existence> 3Wer=Who
<Flutterguy> That TF2 flash was amazing LC
<Lasharus> EGG CARRIER!
<Lasharus> It appeared first in Sonic Adventure.
<LordCelestia> It was
<Lasharus> Which didn't feature that problem.
<Scarthceroth> EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME!
<Sumica> teaspoon of bologna~!
<CriticKitten> Ick. Flashback to that scene? Please no. ._.
<Flutterguy> That did NOT just happen!
<Lasharus> Nah, Sonic Adventure wasn't that bad.
<Scarthceroth> A THIRD AND FOURTH HEDGEHOG!
<CriticKitten> Child funeral, ick. ;_;
<Lasharus> You're still on about 2006 then?
<Scarthceroth> YES!
<Lasharus> Hang on, who's the fourth?
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Lasharus> Oh, Mephiles.
<Flutterguy> What happened to his son?
<Lasharus> The story of that game was an enormous clusterfuck.
<Lasharus> Seriously.
<CriticKitten> Son and daughter both died in a car wreck at a young age.
<Lasharus> I've played it through, and I can't make heads nor tails of most of it.
<Scarthceroth> and then mephiles turned into a mutation of the final boss of SA2
<FreezeFrame> Hit by a truck.
<Flaria> ;_______;
<LordCelestia> They like trains
<Flutterguy> Huh.. then what was that they just showed? An alternate timeline?
*CriticKitten can't imagine anything more horrific than going to a kid's funeral.
<kirzstryfe> rawr
<Lasharus> What, the Biolizard?
<Thunder_Dash> ^
<Flaria> Flutterguy: Flashback
<Lasharus> How does THAT work!?
<Flaria> So many flashbacks
<Scarthceroth> they look kinda similar
<LordCelestia> im goin top play BF3
<Lasharus> And did I miss that part?
<Sumica> flashception
<Lasharus> That, or I blocked it out.
<Flutterguy> Bye then LC!
<Scarthceroth> you didnt see the final boss?
<Luna> 07,01k baabai!
<Lasharus> Like I said, that entire story was a gargantuan clusterfuck.
<Scarthceroth> its a clone of SA2s
<Flaria> We need flashbacks within flashbacks :l
<Lasharus> Nope, don't think so.
<FreezeFrame> Going to your classmate's funeral when he died one block away while you slept completely undisturbed.
<Lasharus> And that's sad.
<Flaria> Seeya LordCelestia
<Scarthceroth> he goes super say- i mean super sonic
<Flutterguy> Flashbackception Flaria!
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Lasharus> Mind you, SOnic Adventure did start one bad trend.
<Scarthceroth> and then flies up and hits the weak point
*Flaria brohoofs Flutterguy
<Lasharus> A non-Robotnik final boss. :(
<Lasharus> Chaos was fine as the final boss.
<CriticKitten> Freeze: Been there (twice). That's pretty high up there, but I imagine if your kid died before you, it'd be even worse.
<Lasharus> But then in SA2 you had the Biolizard.
<Lasharus> In Heroes you had Metal Sonic.
<Scarthceroth> biolizard was actually pretty cool though
<Lasharus> Oh certainly.
<CriticKitten> I'd never be able to handle that.
<kirzstryfe> metal sonic has always been a good fight
<Flutterguy> Having to attend your kid's funeral would be much worse.
<Lasharus> Then Unleashed had that "dark gaia" thing.
<JC_Denton> do a reality check everyone
<Lasharus> Yeah, if only Sonic heroes weren't a bad game Kirz. :P
<Luna> 07,01So... do you guys play left4dead?
<Scarthceroth> i do
*Flaria pats CriticKitten on the back again
<Lasharus> Lunaaaa.
<Scarthceroth> i have l4d2
<Luna> 07,01yay
<Lasharus> I'm in the middle of a rant!
<kirzstryfe> lol
*Luna giggles
*Lasharus sniffles.
<kirzstryfe> I've tried it, but zombie games aren't my favorite
<Luna> 07,01so much ranting!
<Lasharus> Well, to reply to the final point then - Scar, I liked the Biolizard as final boss, certainly. But sadly, the trend was set. Robotnik hasn't been a final boss until Sonic Colours.
<Lasharus> (that was a fun final fight, that one)
<Sumica> You know I used to turn my tv on for sound in the room. till I started coming here.
<Scarthceroth> true
<kirzstryfe> metal sonic from sonic 2 was a pain
<Lasharus> God yes. :p
<Lasharus> Harder than the Robotnik armour after it. :p
<Tovler> Mmm, I wonder what Cuba has been doing recently...
<kirzstryfe> "let's put a boss in the zone, no rings, not save, and one tiny, tiny little weak point"
<Luna> 07,01interesting quit message..
<Flutterguy> Ponies will fill my apartment at school. Nuff said.
<JC_Denton> i wish this place will stream more often
<Flutterguy> Luna ikr?
<CriticKitten> 'swhy I get squirmy with child funerals. So awful.
<Scarthceroth> i liked the super sonic part of the biolizard, but i could never figure out how i won it
<Lasharus> Yip :P
<Lasharus> I know what you mean there Scar.
<Scarthceroth> i just kinda....did it
<Luna> 07,01Well we stream during the week too
<Lasharus> It did feel a bit like "uhh, so I charge now?"
<FreezeFrame> I can only imagine
<MrChang> we stream HOUSE MD
<Flutterguy> JC there are occasional streamers throughout the weekdays.
<CriticKitten> I can't even imagine how that'd feel. XP
<Lasharus> But Sonic Adventure 2 deserves enormous praise for this:
<Luna> 07,01and Dr Who
<CriticKitten> And hope I never have to.
<FreezeFrame> Since my current plans include a childless marriage (I'm indifferent, my long-term gf who I'm 99% likely to marry doesn't want them)
<kirzstryfe> when and what gets streamed during the week?
<Luna> 07,01and Nostalgia content
<Lasharus> Robotnik had possibly his best showing in the entire sonic series there. he was playable. And awesome.
<JC_Denton> I LOVE DOCTOR WHO!
<LordCelestia> If you stream Ed, Ed, n Eddy I will LOVE AND TOLERATE you
<FreezeFrame> Luna: You gonna stream new Haus?
<Sumica> that reminds me I need to get a dvd player set up here so i can stream Stargate.
<Luna> 07,01once I have it, I will :)
<Scarthceroth> you know the vs mode?
<Lasharus> Yup.
<Lasharus> Didn't play it much.
<FreezeFrame> No TV streaming capability?
<Scarthceroth> did you think dark chao was broken as shit?
<Lasharus> Never had a second Dreamcast controller :P
<Scarthceroth> its on gamecube dude
*Flaria hugs Sumica
<JC_Denton> chrono trigger battle theme
<Scarthceroth> but anyway
<Lasharus> That one wasn't part of the ORIGINAL Dreamcast release.
<Luna> 07,01the new House is not airing here (yet)
<CriticKitten> Yay House. That'll be a good break from the sad stuff this weekend. XD
<Sumica> I think I am the only one with a capture card.
<Lasharus> Sonic Adventure DX was a port from the Dreamcast mate :P
<Scarthceroth> it was only in the gamecube version?
<Lasharus> So was Sonic Adventure 2 Battle.
<Lasharus> Yup.
<FreezeFrame> New Haus is tomorrow night.
<Luna> 07,01GGgala too
<Scarthceroth> huh
<MrChang> i already saw the new house ep
<Lasharus> Chaos and Tikal weren't there either.
<Scarthceroth> well dark chao can 2 shot
<Sumica> but house is on when I work so no luck
<Scarthceroth> really?
<Lasharus> Yup.
<Scarthceroth> woow
<Scarthceroth> i prefer the port
<MrChang> an unfinished version
<Lasharus> Well, they just added a few features.
<Lasharus> I don't.
<Lasharus> Some of the added features were bugs.
<Lasharus> Quite a lot of them, in fact.
<GGgala> does easyCap count as a capture card? >_>
<Scarthceroth> could you still glitch out of the normal and dark chao gardens in the dreamcast version?
<Luna> 07,01yep
<Lasharus> Probably. never tried.
<Scarthceroth> i know you can in the gamecube version
<Thunder_Dash> I want a capture card :<
<Lasharus> Though they redesigned the Dark Chao garden in the GC version.
<Sumica> oh right sorry forgot GG has one too.
<Kalisia> Good bye Bronystate.
<Luna> 07,01Goodnight Kalisia
<GGgala> later Kalisia
<CriticKitten> ._.
<Thunder_Dash> Bye, Kalisia
<Scarthceroth> did they have blood instead of water in the dreamcast version?
<Flutterguy> Bye Kalisia
*Flaria hugs Kalisia
<CriticKitten> How is this not hell again?
<Lasharus> Hah, not quite grim enough for that. :P
<Lasharus> But they did change chao mechanics around a fair bit.
<Scarthceroth> they did in GC
<Flutterguy> This is just.. freaky.
<Lasharus> The base game remains the same though.
<Lasharus> One thing that always irritated me about Sonic Adventure 2 though:
<Sumica> they will come here....one day. *Evil laugh*
<CriticKitten> "There's no punishment or judgment". I call horseshit on that, sir!
<Lasharus> Robotnik suddenly adopting the name "Eggman".
<Flutterguy> Horse manure*
<Scarthceroth> hes got the maassta plan
<Thunder_Dash> And hers is the only face in that entire field that isn't a greyish color
<Lasharus> He treats it as a nasty insult in Sonic Adventure 1, and then suddenly he takes the name?
<FreezeFrame> The idea is that the only torment your soul goes through is that which it inflicts on itself.
<kirzstryfe> you do know the story on that right?
<CriticKitten> Pony fecal matter*
<Lasharus> Yes, the song was bloody fantastic.
<Lasharus> Yes, I know Kirz.
<kirzstryfe> :p
<Luna> 07,01Oooh this is the point where I got naughty right..?
<Lasharus> I don't care if it was Eggman in Japan first.
<Lasharus> I grew up with Robotnik. :P
<kirzstryfe> no, not that
*Luna giggles
<CriticKitten> I think so. xD
<Flaria> Oh luna~
<Flutterguy> Um, Luna, what are yo- o.o
*Flaria huggles Luna
<Lasharus> Then what?
<Flaria> Flutterguy: <3
*Luna hugs everypony
<kirzstryfe> forget when exactly, but the original universe robotnik was destroyed in some dimensional/explosion/something
<CriticKitten> Someone needs to make that Twilight-slowly-coming-closer vid with Luna, now. :p
<Lasharus> Oh that.
<Lasharus> Yes, but we're talking game canon now.
*CriticKitten hugs Luna back. xD
<Flutterguy> I'm on it!
<mib_svcycf> ^
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<Lasharus> Most of the Archie storyline has precious little to do with the games.
*mib_svcycf glomps CriticKitten "FUND IT"
<LordCelestia> Luna? Be naughty? Better get MoonDasher
<Flutterguy> Even though I'll probably have crap editing skills.
*mib_svcycf kicks MoonDasher "WRONG CHANNEL!"
<Saturn`> oh! i just remembered! i have a horse riding lesson tomorrow!
<Scarthceroth> i remember the last sonic comic i read
<CriticKitten> :o
<Flutterguy> Saturn` Have you ridden a horse before?
<CriticKitten> Awesome.
<kirzstryfe> with the sa games they pulled more from the comics didn't they?
<MoonDasher> mib_svcycf I heard someone say Naughty Luna
<Saturn`> Flutterguy: once
<MoonDasher> :p
<Scarthceroth> the green guy from sonic riders beat up sonic and then i burned it up
<Silvermane> I know, MoonDasher, I know
<MoonDasher> SILVER :o
<Saturn`> when i was an itty bitty twinkie pinkie
<CriticKitten> Bring a piece of paper and a pencil so that you can attach a cutie mark to your horse while you ride, Saturn`.
<JC_Denton> never have, never will :(
<Flutterguy> Oh hi silvermane.
<MoonDasher> hai
<MoonDasher> hi *
*Silvermane waves at Bronystate
<FLaschnJoe11> Night guys
<Lasharus> Yeah, but the namechange is only really found in game canon Kirz.
<Saturn`> yes! that is a fantastic idea!
<Revolver> Ohai Silvermane
*Flaria hugs Silvermane
<Flutterguy> Bye Joe!
*Silvermane hugs Flaria
<Flaria> Bye FLaschnJoe11
<kirzstryfe> ah
<Lasharus> I heard that guy talk ONCE in Sonic Riders.
<Flaria> Hello~
*Silvermane waves at Revolver
<Thunder_Dash> Hi Silvermane, bye Flaschn
*MoonDasher brohugs Silvermane
<Silvermane> hey Thunder_Dash
<Lasharus> And subsequently turned off the sound whenever he opened his mouth.
<Saturn`> one day, i shall own a horse
*Silvermane brohugs(?) MoonDasher
<Thunder_Dash> :)
<Scarthceroth> hehe
<Saturn`> i shall call her Rainbow Dash
<Lasharus> Some things should really not be allowed.
<MoonDasher> bro hug. A manly hug
<Silvermane> >.>
<Saturn`> then i can ride rainbow dash
<Scarthceroth> why does sonic need a board?
<Scarthceroth> or a car?
*Luna hugs Silvermane
<Saturn`> and life shall be awesome
<Scarthceroth> he can run faster than a rocket car
<Lasharus> Well, they explained away the car.
<Scarthceroth> he did it in the show
<Silvermane> you need to paint it first
<Scarthceroth> how did they explain it?
<Lasharus> "It wouldn't exactly be fair to have Sonic running in a fair race"
<Flutterguy> Rainbow Dash? Silly pony, that's not how you spell Twilight Sparkle!
<Scarthceroth> oh bullshit
<Lasharus> Yes yes, Sonic R did that.
<Silvermane> although... with enough generations of selective breeding and pelt alterations...
<Scarthceroth> thats not an explanation
<Silvermane> you can get COLORED HORSES
<Lasharus> At least they made the effort :P
<FreezeFrame> You all have such a weird way of spelling Rarity.
<GGgala> MoonDasher, with the hearty back slapping?
<Lasharus> And Robotnik is FANTASTIC in Sonic & Sega All-Stars.
*Luna does not get a hug in return from Silvermane?
<Saturn`> my Kindle is already called Twilight Sparkle
<Lasharus> He takes his mini-flier.
<Scarthceroth> if they attached like a colar that explodes if he breaks the rules, then i could see it
<Flutterguy> It's FFVII ALL OVER AGAIN
<Saturn`> it would get confusing
*Luna sobs on the moon
<Lasharus> And converts it into a bloody monster truck.
<Silvermane> oh FreezeFrame, that's not how you spell Fluttershy
<Lasharus> *win*
<Thunder_Dash> Man, am I the only one who can spell Applejack right?
<JC_Denton> (trollface) twilight gritter
<Scarthceroth> wiw
<Scarthceroth> wow
*Revolver hugs Luna
*Silvermane did not see Luna's hug due to not wearing glasses
<Scarthceroth> biwinning
<FreezeFrame> I called my Nook "Yomiko"
*Silvermane is banished to the moon where he has nothing to do but hug Luna
*Silvermane is content with this new life
*Luna hugs Silvermane
*Silvermane hugs Luna "ILU"
<Lasharus> http://images.wikia.com/sonic/images/a/a1/Eggman1.png
<Luna> 07,01"Welcome to the moon! Current population 2!"
<CriticKitten> Huh. Never seen so many people misspell Pinkie Pie.
<Silvermane> "Thanks, Luna! What do you do up here?"
<Saturn`> and a load of bananas?
<Lasharus> (here's to hoping that link works. It won't load for me blast it :P)
<kirzstryfe> *facehoof*
<Revolver> I don't get to go to the moon?
<Scarthceroth> hold on
<Scarthceroth> ive gotta get new pants
<Lasharus> Ah, it did work for you then? P
*Luna smiles and says: "Watching bronies. What brings you here?"
<kirzstryfe> yep
<Flutterguy> *power kicks Revolver to the moon* why wait?
*Silvermane nods, thinking. "Well, I did something stupid, so I got sent here. I forgot to hug you."
<Lasharus> I'm sorry, but that's bloody awesome.
<Lasharus> I suspect Scar agreed.
*Revolver lands on the moon
<Scarthceroth> soo coool
<Luna> 07,01"You are forgiven Silvermane"
<Revolver> Hey Silvermane, hey Luna
<Silvermane> "Hooray! Hug?"
*Luna hugs both
<Lasharus> :P
<Luna> 07,01"What brings you here Revolver?"
*Silvermane hugs Luna and Revolver. It is a very manly hug.
<Lasharus> Completed the entire game as Robotnik. :P
<Lasharus> Was pretty much a given when I bought it.
<Revolver> "I got powerkicked here."
<FreezeFrame> By Flutterguy
<Flutterguy> >_>
<Flutterguy> <_<
*Dumori gazes at the moon with his telescope
<Lasharus> Put it this way: If you like Mario Kart, you'll most likely like Sonic & Sega All-Stars racing. It's essentially just a well-executed clone.
*Luna squeaks! "Gently please!"
*Silvermane moons Dumori
*Flaria flies to the moon, lands and hugs Luna
<Scarthceroth> i hated mario kart
<Scarthceroth> its luck based
*MoonDasher launches himself to the moon
<kirzstryfe> lol, nope :p
<Scarthceroth> there is very little skill
*Silvermane giggles at Luna's Rarity quote, hearing it in her voice.
*Flutterguy feels like flying to the moon but..
*CriticKitten suspects there's about to be a party on the moon.
<Lasharus> Well, Sonic & Sega All-Stars has one very big plus over Mario Kart.
<Sumica> hey that is cheating Flaria
<Lasharus> No. Blue. Shell.
<Scarthceroth> no power ups?
<Thunder_Dash> I want to go to the moon too. D:
<kirzstryfe> no blue shells?
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Scarthceroth> oh hell yes
<Dumori> shall I brake out the song
*Silvermane turns on the disco ball on the moon.
*Luna wonders how a brony can fly up so high!
<Lasharus> There IS an ultimate move.
<Lasharus> But it helps the one who uses it.
*Silvermane boogies down.
<Scarthceroth> what is it?
<Lasharus> So if I'm in 8th and pick up an all-star move, I get the boost.
<Flutterguy> The magic of friendship, Luna!
<Lasharus> Rather than nuking the nr. 1 for no real reason.
*Luna giggles
<Lasharus> Varies per racer.
<Scarthceroth> oh ok
<Flaria> Sumica, I have fire.
<Scarthceroth> so it doesnt screw everyone else over
*MoonDasher turns the entire moon into a great big disco ball!
<Flaria> I am my own jetpack.
<Scarthceroth> it helps just you
<Lasharus> Robotnik transforms his monster truck into his flight form. Equipped with cluster missiles.
<Flutterguy> No air in space means no fire Flaria.
*kirzstryfe builds pony pyramid to reach moon.
*Silvermane licks Flaria
<Flutterguy> *trollface*
<Scarthceroth> uhhh
<Lasharus> Oh, it screws over those near you. :P
<Scarthceroth> what?
<Viola> 06What have I trotted into?
<Viola> 06o.o
<Sumica> but fire needs air.
<Flaria> Flutterguy: Doesn't matter if I reach velocity before exiting space :3
<Flutterguy> Viola #bronystate?
<Luna> 07,01A party!
<MoonDasher> LUNA! :D
<Flaria> the correct velocity*
*MoonDasher glomps Luna
<Luna> 07,01Even better
<Luna> 07,01A party on the Moon!
*Silvermane hugs everypony. "Shame I forgot to put on pants first!"
*Flutterguy teleports to the moon even though he is a pegasus.
*Thunder_Dash gets a unicorn to teleport him to the moon.
<Sumica> problem with hight speed there Flaria
<Flutterguy> Moon party now?
<Viola> 06Am I invited to this party?
<Viola> 06o:
<Luna> 07,01Indeed you are
<Flaria> It's a lot easier to say Celestia banish physics and just do it.
<Flaria> :3
<Scarthceroth> what up faaaaam were dead so it doesnt matter if i teleport through space and time
<CriticKitten> yay party. :3
<Sumica> stoping is and issue when in space.
<Lasharus> :P
*CriticKitten gets to shufflin'.
<Lasharus> But yeah, basically you just get a speed boost and a special ability tailored to your character.
*Viola begins dancing with herself~
*Silvermane hugs Luna very tight. "If you are ever in need of shipping, you know where to go." He kisses her noisily on the cheek.
<Lasharus> Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to go super.
<Flutterguy> Erryday I'm Discordin'
<Lasharus> So does Shadow, unsurprisingly.
<Scarthceroth> in a car?
*MoonDasher overheard Silvers comment
<Scarthceroth> a car?!
<MoonDasher> :o
*Luna giggles and blushes even more
<Lasharus> yeah, he loses the car for the duration.
<Lasharus> Try not to ask.
<Scarthceroth> WHAT?!
*Silvermane is a fillies-colt
<Scarthceroth> its not fair for sonic to run
*Luna joins Viola's dance
<Scarthceroth> but he can run
<Lasharus> Fly, technically.

<Sumica> You dc alot
<Dumori> Time outs
<Dumori> he needs to set up ghosting with nick serve too
<Dumori> so he don't get colour kicked
<Sumica> I dont think I ever get those time outs after i gave up on mirc
<Dumori> I get none with my client
<Dumori> but I don't recomend it
<Sumica> xchat?

<SuperBrony64> Anyway, hope everyone had a fun-filled BronyState Weekend™
<SuperBrony64> I'm off to bed so that I can rot my brain with learning and whatnot tomorrow in class

<SuperBrony64> Night everypony!
<Sumica> Hate this mission
<Sumica> there now I feel better
<Dumori> wait you need op to +i in here
<Sumica> do what?
<Dumori> but I can +x at will
<Dumori> invisable
<Dumori> it's normally an anyone mode
<Sumica> no clue
<Dumori> +x hides ones hostname from uses
<Dumori> +x is more abuse worthy than +i
<Sumica> I would say bring it up with dari if you are worryed about it.
<Sumica> But might just be a ponynet thing now.
<Dumori> I'm not just intreged
<GGgala> uh user modes are generally a server thing i think
<Dumori> genrally yeah
<Dumori> still can hide hostmask from none ops but not just not apear in /whois
<Sumica> oh that lamp
<Sumica> OMG I am gonna throw this damn hone
<Sumica> See she noticed they are missing too.
<Dumori> wow
<Dumori> he's goooooooooooooooood
<Dumori> mime quick shooting and every thing
<Sumica> considdering some one had to motin cap for that it's amusing.
<Trollestia> It appears I forgot to autojoin.
<Sumica> Oh hi

<Trollestia> Hai.
<Dumori> only Street Sharks
<Dumori> It was so jawesome
<Sumica> not the word i would use.
<Dumori> no no
<Dumori> it fits
<Dumori> seeing as it's the shows catchword
<Dumori> admitedly the first ep
<Dumori> wasn't as god as the rest of the show
<Dumori> was epicly slow
<Dumori> needed more eating random things
<Sumica> So you all looking forward to luna in the halloween ep?
<Dumori> Oh GOD YES
<Dumori> way to much tbh
<Trollestia> What? Halloween? I thought it was just for Luna.
<Trollestia> Luna <3, I feel bad for the moon thing now.
<Dumori> it seems to hint at pony halloween in the synopis
<Dumori> what it being Nightmare night
<Dumori> or such
<Trollestia> Meh. Just Luna would be better.
<Dumori> Synopsis: It's Nightmare Night and the macabre celebrations are in full swing when Luna herself shows up in Ponyville, determined to change her frightening public image.
<Dumori> ta-dar
<Trollestia> >macabre celebrations
<Trollestia> Dammit.
<Dumori> candy ponys
<Sumica> seems the plot will still revlove around her even if it's themed
<Dumori> macbre
<Dumori> ...
<Dumori> yeah
<Dumori> sure
<Dumori> Stupid Luna nostailger streams

<Dumori> still I can't belive its one of the best alternaive clubs in the UK
<Dumori> it isn't that good IMHO
<Sumica> I like that cornor shot with the shot gun

<LordCelestia> Ah, I thought you meant you didnt see any of season 1
<LordCelestia> haha
<LordCelestia> And yeah, im definately coming here every other saturday to watch. It's worth getting up a little earlier than usual.
<Trollestia> Right, but I'm usually up around two.
<Trollestia> Provided I slept.
<LordCelestia> Yeah thats usually my summer wakeup time
<LordCelestia> in weekends i seem to be unable to reach 2 anymore for some reason.

<ctrlx> i work at a nursing home so throwing up or diareah and it's straight home
<Dumori> any way hope you feel better soon ctrlx
<Dumori> I can guess
<Dumori> I know in some places its two days after you stop feeling ill you can go back to working in high risk places
<ctrlx> yah it's just our infection control policy
<Dumori> it makes sense
<Dumori> but it must be a bummer if you don't get sick pay while off

<Turgle> Hi Fluttershy`
<Fluttershy`> 08,01dohoho
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I returneth
<Fluttershy`> 08,01hiya
<Dumori> hey hey hey Fluttershy`
<Dumori> I need more pony music
<Dumori> I only have a few 100 tracks
<Dumori> at best
<Dumori> likely 100 tops
*Luna needs more pony music too
<Luna> 07,01but some of it is crap..
<Dumori> true
<Dumori> but I'm sure there are more good tracks I'm missing
<Dumori> in fact I'm almost sure
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I RETURNETH TRIUMPHANT
<Fluttershy`> 08,01lol mIRC is awesome
<Luna> 07,01eeeeyup
*Fluttershy` is using a black background with point 9 calibri text
<Fluttershy`> 08,01point 9? >> I just mean.. 9
<Fluttershy`> 08,01lol
<Fluttershy`> 08,01thinking in led
<Luna> 07,01As long as you do not use comic sans...
<Fluttershy`> 08,01uuughh no
<Fluttershy`> 08,01not papyrus either lol
<Fluttershy`> 08,01or fixedsys
<Fluttershy`> 08,01XD
<Turgle> D: comics sans
<Dumori> I really should mIRC
<Dumori> but right now I like my bastard child of an IRC client
<Fluttershy`> 08,01what are you using?
<Dumori> a mostly self coded
<Dumori> hack based of the very limited IRC support in .libpurple
<Dumori> it has b
<Dumori> bugs
<Fluttershy`> 08,01oooh it's like what flutterbro13 made in Java...
<Dumori> it's a bit fuggly but UI and code wise
<Dumori> yeah but in C
<Dumori> well C++
<Dumori> but I think a few plug in might be in C
<Fluttershy`> 08,01flutterbro knows... java, c, c++, c#, ruby and some other obscure programing languages I know
<Diftraku> wait... libpurple
<Dumori> it's a real mess
<Diftraku> Doesn't pidgin run on that?
<Dumori> yeah
<Dumori> it's basicly self hacked pidgin plugins
<Fluttershy`> 08,01he's a friggin' programming genius... he made a whole game engine from scratch
<Dumori> but I have a pidgin less .exe some place
<Fluttershy`> 08,01he scares me with how much he knows >_<
<Dumori> my programing is admitedly rusty
<Dumori> but I'm not bad
<Diftraku> I take it pidgin has no built-in irc support?
<Dumori> it dose
<Dumori> it's just bad
<Diftraku> :P
<MeteorVenture> to make a game engine from scratch.. you must first invent the universe
<Diftraku> I'll stick with SSH + Screen + Irssi
<Dumori> there are a few open source plugisn that make it better
<Dumori> so I took those hack thme to bits
<Fluttershy`> 08,01MeteorVenture I don't know exactly how he made it of course.... but I saw the result
<Dumori> russeled up some more stuff
<Fluttershy`> 08,01and the result was awesome XD
<Dumori> 3d or 2d?
<MeteorVenture> lol alright
<Dumori> 2d I've done a few times
<Dumori> 3d I get pissed at as I try and make good modern 3d and it's soo hard to code for
<Diftraku> 2d is way simpler
<Dumori> that and I get lazy and diftracted easy
<Diftraku> 3d has that annoying Z-vector
<Dumori> yeah
<Dumori> and all that drawing the 3d too
<Dumori> ugh
<Dumori> then AI is way more fun to code
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I'll have to get him to show some of his stuff...
<Dumori> I'd be a good coder if my attention span wasn't ~6ms
<Dumori> simpley put I get so easly side tracked form any thing
<Diftraku> I don't like coding frontend stuff
<Diftraku> I like doing more backend things
<Dumori> on the plus side I'm now a writer, coder, fencer, physicist, mathematician and philosopher.
<Dumori> I think I'm the same
<Dumori> Diftraku:
<Dumori> UI and GUI's aren't fun
<Dumori> just tedious
<Diftraku> Very
<Diftraku> I can do frontend if needed
<Dumori> I can design them fine
<Dumori> I just hate coding them
<Dumori> after thaty
<Diftraku> Same
*Dumori missed his code monkey job
<Dumori> :(
*Diftraku has never coded for work
<Dumori> it's so so x3
<Diftraku> I self-learnt PHP even :P
<Dumori> I've had two coding jobs
<Dumori> one freelance one as a code monkey
<Dumori> freelance was bam heres a brife cod it ALL
<Dumori> code monkey was mostly the other porgramers spoting my eye for detail ans slaping me in debugging
<Dumori> half the fucks didn't even coment
<Diftraku> lol
<Dumori> hell one guy sent me a mess of go-tos
<Diftraku> lmao
<Dumori> with no coments of documentaion
<Dumori> I just recoded it
<Diftraku> VB?
<Dumori> not sure now
<Diftraku> Or basic
<Diftraku> Both had gotos
<Dumori> a few others do too
<Dumori> C and C++ do
<Dumori> it's not bad if used right IMHO
<RainBroDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU
<Dumori> but these days object based porgraming removes any "good" use 90% of the time
<Diftraku> Yeah, _if_ you use it right
<RainBroDash> 10Obligatory post, since there are people talking about coding
<Diftraku> :P
<Dumori> it;s use full in say loops if you need to recur in an odd way
<Diftraku> I just use foreach/for and break when needed
<Diftraku> If I need to recursively go through an array I can use internal classes for that
<Diftraku> Got to love PHP :3
<Turgle> :D
<Dumori> php not much knowledge of tbh
<Dumori> any more
<Dumori> it's all faded to the back ofmy huge memeory vault
<Diftraku> http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chatroulette-trolling-and-thats-why-i-could-not-finish-my-homework.jpg
<Dumori> I've made bots for web games with it before ect
<Diftraku> :P
<Diftraku> I had a bot for Fallensword
<Diftraku> It went through the whole map by first downloading the map from the server
<Diftraku> Parsing which blocks were passable and which were impassable
<Diftraku> (Caching these results of course :P)
<Dumori> I had a team of them for a web based clan v clan turn based game
<Diftraku> Then it would systematically go through the whole map and kill everymob on it
<Dumori> I basicly just made a clan of bots
<Dumori> what hella funny
<Dumori> perfect timeing in a turn based MMO
<Dumori> can;t beat it
<Diftraku> Yeah :P
<Dumori> It helps I was able to rip most of siad MMO's code
<Dumori> and use it to make a master client
<Diftraku> lol
<Dumori> I was a massive black hat in my early teens
<Dumori> I made Runescape my bitch a few times
<Diftraku> Haven't really hacked anything
<Dumori> including ripping all of it's code and data
<Dumori> and making a free auto updating clone sever net work
<Dumori> and adding a new line or two for the death messages
<Diftraku> At one point, I knew how WoW logs on to a server
<Diftraku> From start to finish
<Dumori> so every now and then it says more than "Oh dear you have died"
<Diftraku> Starting with the handshake and challenge
<Dumori> and abuses you for dieing
<Diftraku> :P
<Dumori> Best part of the first Runesacpe hack
<Dumori> the soical part
<Dumori> I hit a huge road block a ceritan error when it tryed to update, so I worked out what was cuasing it and worked out if a legit client could ever get it
<Dumori> they could so I got support ot fix it golbaly for me, allowing my hack to work
<Diftraku> lol
<Dumori> yup
<Dumori> I'm glad I stoped hacking when I did though
<Dumori> it's got a quite nasty secen in places
<Dumori> with major organised crime groups hopping in. I'd rather not cross such types I value my limbs and such
<Diftraku> Yeah
<Dumori> I whent white hat at the end
<Dumori> stoping fraud groups, CP rings ect
<Dumori> but I dropped out after a member of our littel group got some heavy IRL pressure put on him
<Dumori> I think most of us did (at least lay low for a bit after that(
<Diftraku> No wonder
<Diftraku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLwPQcai0F8&hd=1
<Diftraku> The fug am I watching
<Dumori> ugh my rus is none existant
<Dumori> I have to say I've had a fun 19 years of life
<RainBroDash> 10What was it that made you go whitehat in the end?
<Dumori> the challenge
<RainBroDash> 10Understandable
<Dumori> soem of the pople I was up agaist where as good as me if not better and didn't want to get caught
<Dumori> that and the slightly more legal side of it
<Dumori> and I guess some moral prangs at just random romping round the internet
<Dumori> ANy way time to write steam/electropunk horror seeds for my upcoming RPG game
<Dumori> I'm hoping to run soon
<RainBroDash> 10Fancy :P
<Dumori> It's only an Unhallowed Metropilse game

<Rainbow-Dash> Hey guys. Look http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Magic-Rainbow-Dash-Handmade-Plush-/150667913782?_trksid=p4340.m1374&_trkparms=algo%3DPI.WATCH%26its%3DC%252BS%26itu%3DUCC%26otn%3D15%26ps%3D63%26clkid%3D3217869397637698714
<trebthegamer> will you still love me? will you still have me? when i'm 64
<DashWithRainbows> look at the price...
<prince-dari> Damn.
<Turgle> 300$+
<prince-dari> A lot of money.
<Turgle> .____.
<Rainbow-Dash> Thats a pretty good price on one of that quality though.
<DashWithRainbows> it looks good but i would not pay that much for it
<Rainbow-Dash> I would buy it if I had the money
<Turgle> 28 bids
<Turgle> yeah me too
<trebthegamer> i'd buy it if it wus fluttershy
<DashWithRainbows> the life size one highest bid is $4000?
<Veewave> I'll buy it at a high price.
<Turgle> Hasbro Y U NO make plushies?
<Dumorimasoddaa> close to
<Dumorimasoddaa> if not over by now DashWithRainbows
<Kdude> if only i had the money to buy one :(
<DashWithRainbows> $4002 to be exact
<Rainbow-Dash> 300 dollars is nothing though http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=170703151061
<Dumorimasoddaa> It works out at over a grand a week for makign one
<Dumorimasoddaa> being geniorus with the manhours
<Dumorimasoddaa> and assuming a full time job of making it
<DashWithRainbows> Rainbow-Dash thats what im talking about already xD
<trebthegamer> they howry shieeeeeet
<trebthegamer> 4000$
<DashWithRainbows> the other one looks better IMO
<Kdude> the smaller cheaper one looks better imo
<Dumorimasoddaa> the other one isn't 4 feet tall
<Dumorimasoddaa> but yeah 4 foot smaller one would be the shit
<DashWithRainbows> yeah but its alot cheaper
<Veewave> But the real question is: Will it blend?
<Dumorimasoddaa> yeah
<DashWithRainbows> if you got the right blender
<Rainbow-Dash> It would blend in my room quite nicely Veewave
<Dumorimasoddaa> only have a few wired s in the legs
<Turgle> from 105$ to 4002?
<Rainbow-Dash> DashWithRainbows. Dont even think of doing something like that
<Turgle> that guy will be rich xD
<Dumorimasoddaa> yeah
<Dumorimasoddaa> asuming they maded it as a full tiem job and it took 120 hours ot make
<Dumorimasoddaa> that's a grand a week
<DashWithRainbows> i would laugh if the next day, hasbro now releasing life size pony plushies!! for $100!
<Dumorimasoddaa> I can see life sized main 6 poping up soon enought
<DashWithRainbows> the guy who bought it would be pissed.
<Dumorimasoddaa> really would you turn down that money
<trebthegamer> strange when fanmade stuff is more appealing than the official stuff
<Veewave> yep
<Dumorimasoddaa> even assuming a price dro
<Kdude> if hasbro made official ones that looked anywhere the sort of quality of these fan ones id buy em
<DashWithRainbows> same^
<Turgle> btw 4000$ are a little too much
<Turgle> i think
<trebthegamer> agreed
<DashWithRainbows> if they sold ponies in more franchises in the UK that would be good
<Veewave> Ponynomics^
<Kdude> yeah, uk is pretty dry when it comes to pony merch
<DashWithRainbows> if i do want something, i have to pay ridiculus shipping prices
<Turgle> same here
<trebthegamer> u should see belgium... the toys are here but not the show
<DashWithRainbows> lucky^
<Turgle> same here in italy :D
<trebthegamer> brofist?
<The_Flyin_King> *Brohoof
<trebthegamer> even better
<DashWithRainbows> dat correct term
<trebthegamer> i want to the toystore to look at the toys
<trebthegamer> i swear i wish a clerk came talk to me
<Dumorimasoddaa> I think toy R us stocks them UK
<Dumorimasoddaa> but I'm not going that far for pony
<DashWithRainbows> the blind bags i think Dumorimasoddaa
<Dumorimasoddaa> plus I'm too broke
<DashWithRainbows> but its rare to find one that stocks them
<trebthegamer> honestly the decorations around the toys looked better than the toys themselves
<DashWithRainbows> Tesco = sponsers MLP:FiM so they might sell the toys?
<Dumorimasoddaa> x3
<Dumorimasoddaa> but my dad works in the local tescos
<Kdude> yeah i can imagine the akwardness of me going into toys r us and asking about the mlp fim toys
<Dumorimasoddaa> awrkward buying that would be
<DashWithRainbows> Kdude i wouldnt care about the awkardness
<Dumorimasoddaa> Kdude I'd do it
<Dumorimasoddaa> how ever buying them form the shop your father works
<trebthegamer> i didn't find any good one to get that far
<trebthegamer> prepare to squeee!
<Dumorimasoddaa> thats a whole different kettle of fish.
<trebthegamer> http://www.ebay.com/itm/Fluttershy-Custom-Handmade-Plush-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Magic-/270826210489?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3f0e8004b9
<DashWithRainbows> hmmm
<DashWithRainbows> looks good.
<Turgle> D'AAAWWW
<DashWithRainbows> wont pay that price,
<Dumorimasoddaa> wait do I know how to sew
<AllisZero> morning everypony
<Dumorimasoddaa> yeah that's in my skill set
<Turgle> hi allis
<DashWithRainbows> hey AllisZero
<DashWithRainbows> http://www.ebay.com/itm/Pinkie-Pie-Custom-Handmade-Plush-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic/270826208862?ssPageName=WDVW&rd=1&ih=017&category=230&cmd=ViewItem
<DashWithRainbows> i think looks pretty good
<DashWithRainbows> not bad price either
<trebthegamer> same guy
<DashWithRainbows> i know
<Kdude> i dont have that kind of cash to throw at expensive plushies unfortunately
<Dumorimasoddaa> I need money I can sew
<Turgle> ^
<Dumorimasoddaa> Euro plushies quick cash in on this craze
<trebthegamer> i bought 3 games this month and i have a con later this month
<Dumorimasoddaa> x3
<trebthegamer> so i really need to save a bit X3
<Dumorimasoddaa> I own $7
<Dumorimasoddaa> £7*
<DashWithRainbows> saving money up for FushiCon in november = spare cash will go towards buying halo anniversary
<Dumorimasoddaa> I'm so rich its mad
<Dumorimasoddaa> saving up for Unhallowed Met Revised and 40kRPG: Black Crusade
<trebthegamer> my bank account has 7000 euro. mom's even counting on me to have backup money in case something goes wrong
<DashWithRainbows> tesco sells some of the MLP:FiM toys...
<DashWithRainbows> im checking their website now
<AllisZero> My account has $130 and decreasing fast.
<AllisZero> Family takes up all of my salary and it still isn't enough
<AllisZero> Shitty times I say
<Dumorimasoddaa> i'm nigh on broke and I waiting on welfare money so I can eat decent food.
<DashWithRainbows> i can never find any stores that sell MLP:FiM bedsheets
<trebthegamer> mom asks 250 euro to cover my room and food
<DashWithRainbows> a month?
<trebthegamer> i really am lucky for being mentally disabled
<trebthegamer> yup
<Dumorimasoddaa> I couldn't use FiM bed sheets
<AllisZero> Heh, I pay $900 for living expenses at home, but actually chip in about $2000
<Dumorimasoddaa> I shoudl file for disability
<Dumorimasoddaa> what with my migraines and such
<Kdude> i wish hasbro would just make some standard accurate-to-the-show pony models so i would have something to put on my desk :(
<Dumorimasoddaa> I doubt I'd hold a none fexable job with them
<trebthegamer> i got it years ago. went to a school that drove me nuts
<Dumorimasoddaa> some weeks i'm luck to get 2 useable days
<DashWithRainbows> Kdude dont we all wish for that?
<trebthegamer> if i wasn't mentally disabled before i entered the school i definatly am now
<Kdude> i would give them my money, why dont they want my money :'(
<Turgle> i want plushies
<Turgle> i demand plushies
<trebthegamer> i get over 900 euro a month but half of that will dissapear when i get a job
<Turgle> i pretend plushies
<Dumorimasoddaa> though I don;t really want to go though all the bull shit needed to claim disability
<Dumorimasoddaa> all those Doctors and such
<trebthegamer> not really worth it. the change of school made me lose any friend i had left
<trebthegamer> and when school ended once again
<trebthegamer> any of u have that friend from school you hang out with after school?
<DashWithRainbows> obviously...
<trebthegamer> that was only possible for me as long as i went to school
<VioletVanilla> 06Burn me
*DashWithRainbows burns VioletVanilla
<The_Flyin_King> Uuuh.
*Luna douses Violet flames
<DashWithRainbows> :3 fire cleans everything
<trebthegamer> when it ended i barly even hear from them. tough my best pal still sends me usefull sites
<Dumorimasoddaa> fire is fun

<Fluttershy`> 08,01furururu
<Arentius> well now i'm just confused
<AllisZero> Woona
<The_Flyin_King> Wait if theres no air on the moon does that mean luna has to ALWAYS use magic to keep her breathing?
<Luna> 07,01ya rang?
<AllisZero> Hi
<DashWithRainbows> she made a special force field that has air
<Arentius> Luna is immortal she doesn't need oxygen
<Luna> 07,01Hi AllisZero
<AllisZero> Howru
<VioletVanilla> 06Delicious and yourself? ;3
<AllisZero> Sleepy as a 'mofo, had insomnia most of the night
<AllisZero> And the rest I dreamed of scary shit
<The_Flyin_King> Unless luna is using cyro or something
<The_Flyin_King> The force field made sense though
<The_Flyin_King> otherwise she would just fly back to equestria
<The_Flyin_King> somehow
<Fluttershy`> 08,01VioletVanilla~
<Arentius> i'm sticking with immortal and not needing air >.>
<Fluttershy`> 08,01check da shower O_O

<Arentius> wow 5 server disconnects that was fun and laggy
<Fluttershy`> 08,01srsly tho check showerchat if ya can lol
<The_Flyin_King> Well its only luck that they are both female if they are immortal otherwise you would have massive alicorn overpopulations

<Veewave> Well I gotta get back to school.
<Veewave> Bye
<Arentius> Pretty good thanks :)
<Arentius> you had a good day?
<trebthegamer> for some reason i felt like listening to nightmare before christmas music
<Arentius> that is because it is amazing music
<kirzstryfe> hey there
<Luna> 07,01hey it's a great movie too
<trebthegamer> listen to ALL the songs!!!!!
<Arentius> aloha kirz
<kirzstryfe> if I don't respond at first it's because I'm working on a picture, checking the chat every 10-15min
<Fluttershy`> 08,01sooo Luna anything on stream yet? and which one will you be usin'?
<Arentius> hehe fair enough
<Arentius> not like much is going on at the mo anyway :p
<VioletVanilla> 06That is great movie. . .
*Fluttershy` for some reason wants to have another s1 marathon... sigh
<Dumorimasoddaa> I must have seen every pony episode at least 12 times
<Arentius> only 12?
<Arentius> you're letting the team down:P
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I've only seen each ep about... three times
<Arentius> *pinkie pie style gasp*
<Arentius> maybe i'm just an addict..
<Fluttershy`> 08,01eh don't have much personal time
<Dumorimasoddaa> by 12 I mean my least fav must have hit 12 by now
<Arentius> oh thats ok then
<Dumorimasoddaa> I has too much
<Arentius> its fun not having a life :D
<Dumorimasoddaa> and I don't sleep
<trebthegamer> i has loads o time but most of it goes into the fanfic
<trebthegamer> tough lately i'm a bit stuck
*Dumorimasoddaa yawns likes ans lion
<Fluttershy`> 08,01well, it's not personal time in that sense so much. I have a dorm room all to myself...
<Fluttershy`> 08,01so I probably could have a marathon
<Fluttershy`> 08,01but I like to be on bronystate a lot
<Fluttershy`> 08,01o_O so I can watch you guys...
<Fluttershy`> 08,01XD
<DashWithRainbows> same ^
<Dumorimasoddaa> x3
<Arentius> haha yeah bronystate has kept me up till like 4-5am the past 3 days in a row..
<Dumorimasoddaa> learn to window oh Fluttershy`
<Luna> 07,01amazing right? :)
<Arentius> or dual screen
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I do know how to window
<Dumorimasoddaa> I haven't really left all weekend bar sleep
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I just love BronyState so much
<Arentius> you're partially to blame for my sleep deprivation Luna!
<DashWithRainbows> i only sleep about 4 hours a day anyway so bronystate either keeps me up longer or just keeps me from being bored
*Luna is sowwy
<Arentius> I wasn't complaining ;)
*Arentius hugs Woona
<Fluttershy`> 08,01sleep deprivation...
<Dumorimasoddaa> Luna I got asked to a gig tonight for free
<Fluttershy`> 08,01mmm
<Dumorimasoddaa> turned it down cos nostailger is way better
<Dumorimasoddaa> sleep dep mays everying better
<Fluttershy`> 08,01bronystate + irl problems + rping with Silver = no time for anything else xD
<Arentius> sleep is for the weak
*DashWithRainbows currently training for a 2 week no sleep
<Arentius> why would you do that :o
<Dumorimasoddaa> 2 weeks is likely rather dangerious
<Arentius> yeah just a bit
<DashWithRainbows> hallucinate = ponies
<Fluttershy`> 08,012 weeks?
<DashWithRainbows> need i say any more
<Fluttershy`> 08,01isn't that technically impossible?
<Dumorimasoddaa> dude you need 72+ to hall
<trebthegamer> anyone wanna help me with my fanfic with suggestions?
<VampirePrincess> hey ppls
<Dumorimasoddaa> 2 weeks will most likely kill you
<Arentius> i;ve done a week and a half due to my insomnia
<DashWithRainbows> Dumorimasoddaa i done a week without sleep...
<Arentius> then i slept for 3 days
<Arentius> that was badtimes
<kirzstryfe> crazy ponies
<Dumorimasoddaa> same Arentius more or less
<Arentius> wasn't by choice
<Dumorimasoddaa> I hate losing dats
<Dumorimasoddaa> it's weird
<Arentius> my dr wouldn't give me sleeping pills cause he thought i was lying -.-
<Fluttershy`> 08,012 weeks of no sleep is impossible
<Fluttershy`> 08,01it will kill you
<Arentius> and I can treb!
<Arentius> nah theres been a recorded case of someone staying up for 3
<Arentius> he was clinically insane
<Arentius> but alive
<DashWithRainbows> Fluttershy` im willing to test it... if i feel really terrible then i will sleep
<Dumorimasoddaa> yeah
<Fluttershy`> 08,01....how about you just not risk it
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I would be horrified if you died ;___;
<Dumorimasoddaa> and people have done huge amount of time on really little sleep
<trebthegamer> i'm a little stumped cus i want the Spy and Rarity to have more interaction. any ideas?
<Arentius> ooo you're the writer of the TF2 fic? :o
<Dumorimasoddaa> voyerism?
<Rainbow-Dash> You cant kill yourself from lack of sleep, your body will shut down whether you like it or not.
<Dumorimasoddaa> it's a form of interaction
<Dumorimasoddaa> Rainbow-Dash not true
<Fluttershy`> 08,01true... but still... :< there are ways to force one to stay awake from energy drinks and caffeine pills..
<Dumorimasoddaa> other wise people wouldn't have died from it
<DashWithRainbows> your body de-toxifies when you sleep
<prince-dari> Arentius: Talk in the main channel then, more people. :P
<Arentius> if you have enough caffiene you just become immune
<VioletVanilla> 06Rainbow-Dash
<DashWithRainbows> if you dont sleep, it makes a strain on your body, your brain is not going to function properly and etc
<Arentius> I am talking in the main channel! but i like it in here cause its slower
<DashWithRainbows> but 1 week done nothing to me
<Rainbow-Dash> Hm
<Dumorimasoddaa> I'm almost reversed in the effect caffien has on me
<trebthegamer> sorry i disconnected for a sec
<Dumorimasoddaa> I makes me sleepy soem times
<kirzstryfe> lol
<DashWithRainbows> i dont like the taste of coffee, only the smell
<Dumorimasoddaa> I love coffee
<VampirePrincess> laterss ppls
<trebthegamer> anyway meke sure it's the right TF2 fic ur thinking of. on fanfic.net im #8 XD

<Arentius> Rainbrodash: Yup I live 5 mins away from a chippy on the seafront
<Fluttershy`> 08,01what?

*Arentius sings "its a small world afterall"
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15would you rather me make bad puns or discuss my favorite pizza place? :P
<Arentius> robotpinkie: can you make bad puns about your favourite pizza place and give us the best of both?
<The_Flyin_King> I'm on.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I... don't know
<Dumorimasoddaa> don;t really miond now

<Fluttershy`> 08,01I technically live about 10 or so miles away from Val XD
<Arentius> you must! you must you must you must!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I probably could, but I'd feel really bad about it
<Dumorimasoddaa> i've engange stoic hunger mode
*DashWithRainbows has returned with his triple decker sammich
<ctrlx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSUzIU03dFo&feature=related

<Arentius> lo rod! not bad yerself?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah there's this amazing pizza place near where I used to live, only pizza place I've seen that's actually owned by an italian :P
<FreezeFrame> So, my dorm room is about to take the first ponification step
<Arentius> 9/10 for effort pinkie, I had to slice off a bit for going with the obvious though
<Fluttershy`> 08,01moist and delicious?
<RainBroDash> 10Orly FreezeFrame
<Fluttershy`> 08,01Moist. And. Delicious.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01XD
<FreezeFrame> Free signs at the student lounge = 20% cooler sign
<FreezeFrame> Specifically, Danger: This room is 20% cooler. Enter at your own risk.
<DashWithRainbows> my sammich is filled with ham, cheese, cucumber and my favourite BBQ SAUCE!
<Suinide> Hmm
<Arentius> ewww BBQ sauce is a violation on everything bug chargrilled steaks
<DashWithRainbows> its good on chicken...
<prince-dari> RainBro used to live about 20 mintues from me.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol no Arentius, that's no joke, I literally haven't seen it elsewhere
<prince-dari> Then he went to uni. >_>
<Suinide> Dark_Shadow_Dragon
<RainBroDash> 10Dari hurry up and turn 18 and we can go drinking in Brighton
<RainBroDash> 10kthx.
<Arentius> robotpinkie: i'm sad you missed my little return pun :(
<DashWithRainbows> llol
<Rodman> Speaking of making dorms 20% cooler, I recently found this place in town to print posters
<RainBroDash> 10Rodman do eeeeet
<prince-dari> Pubs are overrated, come back to the fields, yo. :P
<Rodman> I simply NEED to stop by there, take my USB, and print me some pony
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No I got the pun, but presumably you were still serious about me making a joke :P
<RainBroDash> 10XD rofl dari, o u
<Arentius> why are all the mods living withing my vicinity of the country! ....uk brony meetup needed
<DashWithRainbows> oui^
<Rodman> lol Dari
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't like pizzas with soggy crust...
<Dumorimasoddaa> I'd walking there
<DashWithRainbows> no one does RobotPinkie
<Dumorimasoddaa> I can make that
<Dumorimasoddaa> walk it*
<RobotPinkie> 06,15If there's a huge brony meetup in the UK, I'd totally go even though I'm not from there...
<Arentius> agreed robotpinkie crispy thin based pizza ftw
<Arentius> I think we should sort a UK brony meetup
*Dumorimasoddaa is a South Yorkshire brony
<DashWithRainbows> Fushicon would be a good meetup xD
<Arentius> i can't make it to that end of the country :(
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Unsurprisingly, perhaps, italians make really good pizza :P
<DashWithRainbows> hey Lasharus
<Lasharus> Good evening :)
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wonder if they're also good at plumbing, or if that's just fiction...
<MantisToboggan> i should get a cooler
<Arentius> bahaha
<MantisToboggan> and write "20%" on it
<Rodman> Crusty pizza, good stuff
<Lasharus> Hey everyone I know.
<Lasharus> And hey everyone I don't know.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hay Lasharus
<Arentius> I did get a rainbow dash drawn on my dominoes pizza box
<DashWithRainbows> nice^
<Rodman> Hi Lasharus
<Arentius> but myf riend stole it :(
<Rodman> Arentius, pics
<Rodman> Awwww
<DashWithRainbows> tell me where he lives, i will kick him in the dick
<Arentius> I'll get another one done :P
<Lasharus> Be nice DashWithRainbows. :P
<Arentius> i think it'll have to be fluttershy next
<DashWithRainbows> stealing is wrong = must be punished = my foot is justice
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That was an amazing idea with the dominos request... I wonder who thought of it
<Arentius> I've seen it done a few times
<Arentius> so tested it myself
<Lasharus> Seen several images of weird requests on pizza orders that were actually fulfilled.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'd just try with "draw best pony on the box"
<Lasharus> Might be pushing it. :P
<Lasharus> can't guarantee that they're all bronies, after all.
<Arentius> ...i really want to order dominoes now
<Arentius> just for the pony
<Lasharus> Heh, I already ate.
<Arentius> same
<Arentius> i just want my pony box
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, obviously they're not all bronies, but I'd still like to try...
<prince-dari> You'd get Dash back of course.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and if I got a box with Pinkie Pie on it, my head would explode
<DashWithRainbows> i could order dominoes but i am saving up cash for Fushicon and Halo anniversary
<Lasharus> Point taken RobotPinkie.
<FreezeFrame> That's a weird way of spelling Rarity, dari
<Lasharus> And Prince-dari: That's only a SUSPICION.
<prince-dari> That's not suspicion.
<Lasharus> You might've confused that name for Twilight's.
<prince-dari> Dash is best pony.
<Rainbow-Dash> ^
<Rainbow-Dash> :P
<DashWithRainbows> thats a wierd way of spelling Every pony prince-dari
<prince-dari> Therefore if you ask for best pony, you can only receive Dash.
<Arentius> robotpinkie: my plan is to get all the ponies eventually
<Lasharus> Actually, I'm with DashWithRainbows.
<Denied_Existence> Dash is my favorite
<FreezeFrame> Imagine if you ask for best pony and you get a drawing of Taste the Rainbow
<Arentius> Agreed Dari
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That sounds like a pretty cool plan... then upload a pic with all the boxes in it, Arentius?
<Rainbow-Dash> Unless the people at Dominoes have some sort of twisted reality stuck in their heads, of course.
<Arentius> dash is best pony
<Denied_Existence> Being a loyal person myself...
<Arentius> robot pinkie: I will do!
<Lasharus> I'll avoid promoting "best pony". It appears to be a bit of a wasp's nest to get into.
<FreezeFrame> Lasharus: It's all in good fun.
<prince-dari> Well I've run out of big Mountains to take Twilight up in the UK.
<Arentius> ...what
<Lasharus> Oh most assuredly FreezeFrame. :P
<Denied_Existence> All ponies are best, but Dash is my favorite.
<prince-dari> MFW capital 'M' for no reason.
<Denied_Existence> :)
<prince-dari> INB4 Everest.
<prince-dari> I would love to do tht.
<Lasharus> That'll work for me denied_existence. :)
<Arentius> /confluttershied
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Prince Blueblood is most definitely not best pony :P
<prince-dari> that*
<FreezeFrame> It's not like I'm threatening to hateshank bronies who disagree.
<DashWithRainbows> inb4 Ben nevis
<prince-dari> ^ already done
<Lasharus> ...did you just say that Alex?
<FreezeFrame> RobotPinkie: I think everyone can agree
<Fluttershy`> 08,01prince-dari
<prince-dari> You mean inafter
<prince-dari> :P
<Fluttershy`> 08,01shower
<prince-dari> RainBro's shower?
<Fluttershy`> 08,01and plots
<Fluttershy`> 08,01lots of plots
<DashWithRainbows> such a demanding girl now isnt she?
<FreezeFrame> And yes, hateshank you with your own horn is my favorite saying thanks to a comedy shipfic.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Requesting pic of prince-dari and Brian Blessed on top of Mt. Everest, holding ponies.
<Lasharus> ...that's a novel sentiment FreezeFrame.
<FreezeFrame> It was a Rarijack where AJ carried their child.
<prince-dari> XD
<Fluttershy`> 08,01plots and showers... oh gawds...
<FreezeFrame> And had twins
<FreezeFrame> RobotPinkie: You misspelled BRIAN BLESSED. :P
<Denied_Existence> Makes me wish i had wings...
<prince-dari> DashWithRainbows: http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/DSCF1214.jpg
<prince-dari> That's Twilight atop Ben Nevis.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol oh of course, FreezeFrame
<prince-dari> It was damn cold up there.
<DashWithRainbows> my god....
<prince-dari> I had ice forming on me.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01it's so cold here...
<Lasharus> ...what the hell.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01brrrrr
<prince-dari> And I was soaking wet because I'd climbed up a stream for a shortcut.
<Denied_Existence> I would totally give people wing hugs.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I should start taking pics of Pinkie Pie in cool places in Sweden....
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I live in the friggin' mountains :<
<DashWithRainbows> this is reaching epic proportions from which my head explodes
<FreezeFrame> Where's Ben Nevis again?
*EspyLacopa is basking in wondrous 60 degree temperature
<Fluttershy`> 08,01and it's SO COLD
<FreezeFrame> Iceland?
<FreezeFrame> It seems like Iceland.
<prince-dari> Ben Nevis is the biggest mountinain the UK.
<Arentius> wooo mass of messages
<RobotPinkie> 06,15On top of the Globe, maybe?
<Arentius> and yes i did lash
<Arentius> because i can
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...though that'll cost some money...
<Lasharus> Grmpf.
<prince-dari> It's in Scotland.
<Lasharus> Anyway, how is everyone?
<Rainbow-Dash> So...
<Lasharus> Pardon me. Everypony?
<FreezeFrame> Ah, cool.
<DashWithRainbows> inb4 prince-dari takes all his MLP toys to the exact point of the north pole
<FreezeFrame> Geographic, or magnetic?
*Arentius puts DashWithRainbows head in a bucket to prevent mess
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I live in UTAH
<Denied_Existence> Something about wrapping myself up with a pair of wings just sounds warm and comfy as hell...
<Fluttershy`> 08,01but...
*Luna is proud she did the Ben!
<FreezeFrame> Since he's a UK citizen, it's easy enough for him to get to Canadia
<Fluttershy`> 08,01it's so cold ;___;
<Fluttershy`> 08,01especially at dis elevation
<EspyLacopa> Dread Pirate Woona?
<DashWithRainbows> Canadia....SRSLY BRO??? IT'S Canada! GRAMMAR NAZI AWAY!!
<prince-dari> I did Ben Nevis in 2 hours and 10 minutes.
<prince-dari> I'm pretty proud of that.
<prince-dari> I was so disappoint I didn't make 2 hours though. XD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You mean SPELLING nazi, DashWithRainbows. :P
<FreezeFrame> DashWithRainbows: I was doing that intentionally.
<Denied_Existence> For gods sake, if medical technology advances enough, I am getting a pair of goddamn wings.
<Lasharus> That was overcapitalisation RobotPinkie.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01biotechnology ftw!
<Lasharus> I don't care if it's for the purposes of emphasis.
*DashWithRainbows flips a table "look a distraction!"
<FreezeFrame> I'm well aware that the 51st state is spelled Canada. :P
<Luna> 07,01suddenly
<Luna> 07,01silence
<Denied_Existence> And then I will just lie in bed wrPped in them for like a week
<Lasharus> Hey Luna. :)
*RobotPinkie slaps Lasharus with a large TROUT
<RobotPinkie> 06,15:P
<Fluttershy`> 08,01not for long!
<Lasharus> ...what was THAT for?
<Arentius> stupid chat keeps breaking
<Lasharus> Ow!
<Arentius> Pinkie stop destroying reality!
*Fluttershy` glomps Luna
<Denied_Existence> wrapped*
<Arentius> woooonnaaaa!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No one likes trouts?
*Dumorimasoddaa wishes he could his computer to hsi bed
<Arentius> I prefer Tuna
<Lasharus> Well, not to the face, no.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I like trains
<DashWithRainbows> i prefer Cod...
<Dumorimasoddaa> really wants to nest
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ohay Luna
<prince-dari> DashWithRainbows: http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/DSCF1070.jpg - That's Twilight atop Snowdon
*Lasharus glomps Luna.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Been there dari
<Dumorimasoddaa> is a fun hike
<Lasharus> But yeah RobotPinkie, if you want to slap me with something, something non-fishy would be appreciated.
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAXhIQoRYvs <-- O.o
<Arentius> Wooonnnaaa!
<EspyLacopa> Optimus must have a cold.
*Arentius slaps Lasharus with a tree
<Lasharus> ...that'll do.
<prince-dari> Snowdon took 1 hour 34 minutes.
<FreezeFrame> Now I want to take one up Mount Marcy
<DashWithRainbows> seen it EspyLacopa
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'll remember that next time, Lasharus :P
<Lasharus> No stench. The splinters are mildly annoying though.
<FreezeFrame> It's the tallest mountain in my state.
<Arentius> it was a varnished tree...
*Dumorimasoddaa slaps some pony with some other pony
<Lasharus> A...
<Lasharus> A varnished...
<prince-dari> It was so much more hospitable, it had a damn cafe at the top.
<Lasharus> ..............
<LunaShy> 07,01what happened...
<FreezeFrame> Arentius: Why are you hitting people with Fluttershy? :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ohay again, LunaShy
<Lasharus> argle.
<LunaShy> 07,01I just dc-d..
<prince-dari> Ben Nevis was like... I dunno, a different world. O_o
<DashWithRainbows> dat LunaShy
<Lasharus> Ah. Welcome back Luna. :)
<Arentius> *prods lash* ...i think i broke him
<Lasharus> brw?
<Arentius> Woooonna! welcome back
<Dumorimasoddaa> Nevis a real hike
<Arentius> Freeze: i was wondering who would make that comment...and because shes soft fluffy and unable to actually hurt people
<FreezeFrame> 5,344 feet (1,629 meters)
<Arentius> or be hurt by it herself
<Lasharus> wubble?
<prince-dari> Heh, that's bigger than Ben Nevis FreezeFrame.
<FreezeFrame> Still not tall enough to have a snowline
<Lasharus> *gargling noises*
<Dumorimasoddaa> yeah no British mount has a snow line
<Arentius> *pokes lasharus again*
<FreezeFrame> The article picture on it is in the summer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Marcy_%28New_York%29
<Arentius> yeah definately broken
*Lasharus shakes himself.
<Lasharus> Sorry about that gentlemen. I can't be quite sure what came over me.
<Arentius> *pilfers wallet*
*Lasharus smacks Arentius.
<Lasharus> Should've been a BIT faster.
*FreezeFrame has a lot of mountains in his state.
<Arentius> :(
<Arentius> L;(
<Arentius> :'( *
*Lasharus retrieves his wallet. Nice try Arentius.
*Dumorimasoddaa thorws a brick at Dumori
<Arentius> not sure where that L came from
<FreezeFrame> Since the Appalachains, Catskills, and Adirondacks are all in upstate NY
<Arentius> ...maybe my subconcious wants me to read deathnote again
<Lasharus> Anyway, not sure what happened to my brain. Apparently someone said something so inconceivably THICK I shut down for a moment.
<Arentius> my bad
<Lasharus> And given that it would be someone saying something THICK, the blame naturally falls on Arentius.
<Lasharus> See?
<FreezeFrame> well, the Appalachains go through, I should say.
<Arentius> *waves to everypont and bows*
<Arentius> i give up on spelling -.-
<Dumorimasoddaa> Spelling is for the week
<Lasharus> And, should you try to drive me nuts again, on life.
<Lasharus> Dumori? I may have to injure you now. I'll try to be nice.
<Dumorimasoddaa> go ahead
<Lasharus> *NUKE*
<Lasharus> Well, I tried.
<Dumorimasoddaa> nuke pfft lazy
<Arentius> Dumori wins
<Lasharus> *sigh*
<EspyLacopa> I /could/ go into WoW to hunt down rare items. . .but I'm finding a lack of interest now. Possibly due to lack of ponies.
<Arentius> WoW needs pony mounts
<Lasharus> ...I now wonder if there's a mod that converts models into ponies.
<Dumorimasoddaa> you could hunt rare ponies in WOW
<Arentius> I'd resub for that
<Dumorimasoddaa> no idea if they exist but thats why you hunt
<Arentius> Herdmind lash
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<EspyLacopa> ...What if the Worgen were werePONIES instead of werewolves?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15If they just reskinned the entirety of WoW to a pony game, I'd buy that
<Lasharus> :P
<Arentius> that would be awesome...cause when they go into running free mode they can just be normal ponies
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Just pony mounts though? I don't think so
<Lasharus> I'd racechange so fast your head would spin Espy.
<trebthegamer2> someone might be working on that
<Lasharus> Don't know Treb.
<Arentius> OK someone needs to make World of ponycraft a real game
<EspyLacopa> And until now they've been ruled by Nightmare Moon, but during all the Cataclysm nonsense, they finally deposed her and regained their senses.
<Lasharus> It's not as easy as just reskinning.
<Lasharus> That's one way of working through Gilneas' storyline Espy. :P
<Arentius> You could have nightmare moons followers and celestias followers for the factions
<Lasharus> What, the Nightmarish Horde and the Celestial Alliance?
<Arentius> in essence
<Lasharus> :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Sounds good to me.
<Lasharus> Could work.
<EspyLacopa> Would be 200% cooler than goblins.
<Arentius> Garrosh would work as nightmare moon
<FreezeFrame> Except the Horde are not evil
<Arentius> then set it back during the first war
<EspyLacopa> That's ok, Luna isn't evil either.
<Arentius> when they were bloodthirsty and demon posessed
<FreezeFrame> Yes, but NMM is
<EspyLacopa> Celestia helping out the Alliance, Luna with the Horde, working to bring both sides to harmony.
<EspyLacopa> With the Nightmares teaming up with the Twilight Hammer cult.
<Arentius> the twilight hammer cult needs to be redone in lore
<Dumorimasoddaa> sweet sweet coffee
<Lasharus> The Twilight Nightmare Cult?
<Arentius> ...to be obsessed with twilight
<AllisZero> I come back from lunch and there's talk of World of Equinecraft?
<Lasharus> Oh deary me.
<Lasharus> Essentially so AllisZaro.
<Arentius> and twilight becomes an old one
<Lasharus> Welcome back.
<EspyLacopa> AllisZero: Because WoW doesn't have enough pony.
<kirzstryfe> I blame Lash
<Lasharus> C'thwilight, Arentius? :P
<Arentius> hence why shes celestias prized student
<AllisZero> Yep, it does not
<Arentius> xD
<AllisZero> Also hi everypony, RobotPinkie
<Lasharus> Thank you Kirz. :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hay AllisZero
<Lasharus> I take the blame happily.
<Lasharus> ...goddamnit, I'm going to have to start writing a fanfic now, aren't I?
<Arentius> Lash lets get on it
<Lasharus> Well, that could work. :P
<EspyLacopa> So I figure the werePonies could get say, Paladin, Druid, Warrior, Hunter, Priest, and Mage.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think I need to go play a bit of ICO
<Lasharus> D'aww.
<Arentius> i disliked ICO
<Lasharus> And that could work Espy.
<AllisZero> Applejack - Paladin; Fluttershy - Druid; Twilight - Mage; Rainbow Dash - Rogue; Rarity - Priest; Pinkie - Death Knight (?)
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I love everything about ICO, except the battles...
<Lasharus> I've played as a mage for over 6 years. Race-changing wouldn't be a problem whatsoever. :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Unfortunately there are a lot of battles, but eh... they're not that hard, just boring...
<EspyLacopa> Nah, Death Knights are for every race, I don't count them.
<Lasharus> Pinkie as a warlock?
<Arentius> i would put pinkie as a warlock
*Dumorimasoddaa actually dislikes WoW. So this cnovo is way over his head
<AllisZero> Wow.
<AllisZero> I totally forgot about MY Class
<Lasharus> Heh, sorry Dumorimasoddaa.
<Arentius> she breaks the fourth wall too much
<Dumorimasoddaa> np
<Lasharus> That's kinda sad AllisZero :P
<DashWithRainbows> never played WoW, never will
<Dumorimasoddaa> it's better than food
<AllisZero> Yeah it is...
<Dumorimasoddaa> every talking about food
<AllisZero> I guess Warlock isn't just a class for me, it's a lifestyle!
<Dumorimasoddaa> when you ve just said youve hardly eatten for 5 days
<RobotPinkie> 06,15In Batmare, Pinkie Pie would totally be The Riddler. That's all I have to say. :P
<Lasharus> Oh dear...
<Dumorimasoddaa> Not 100% sure RobotPinkie
<EspyLacopa> In Batmare, Pinkie would be Mister Mysterio.
<EspyLacopa> Complete with fishbowl hat.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15that would be Spider-Mare, wouldn't it? :P
<Rainbow-Dash> So much rage on the Battlelog forums
<EspyLacopa> No no, this is Batmare.
<EspyLacopa> But remember. Pinkie Pie.
<Arentius> no batmare pinkie would be the riddler...or the joker
<AllisZero> HAHAHA
<AllisZero> I just googled Cyanide
<AllisZero> To get quickly to Cyanide and Happiness
<AllisZero> This is my first result:
<AllisZero> Purchase Of Cyanide Everyone Wants to Pay a Low Price. Deals - Purchase Of Cyanide! www.NexTag.com
<Lasharus> ........wot.
<Lasharus> I'll admit that that's vaguely disturbing.
<Lasharus> Right, tonight's raid is going to be hilarious.
<Lasharus> I'll be on the chat here, raiding in WoW, and transcribing a text for uni.
<EspyLacopa> ...Got voice chat for your WoW raid?
<Lasharus> Yup.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Wow, low price on cyanide, where do I sign up? :P
<EspyLacopa> Going to break into song during a break in the raid?
<Lasharus> God no.
<Lasharus> I don't sing, I play guitar.
<EspyLacopa> ...Keep the guitar close.
<Lasharus> Why?
<AllisZero> I got banned from ventrilo once for playing the FiM soundboard... a bit too much
<Lasharus> Hah.
<DashWithRainbows> lol^
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Sing WWU during LK raid, srsly...
<Lasharus> RobotPinkie, could you fix something for me quickly?
<AllisZero> My raid leader is a narrow-minded douche so what can you say
<Lasharus> Arentius DC'd, but he's still 'in' the chatroom. Could you kick him so he can rejoin?
<AllisZero> I'm actually planning on writing a Healthstone song based on Cupcakes
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's not going to help, Lasharus, he won't be able to rejoin until ping timeout :(
<EspyLacopa> Imagine if you started singing WWU during said LK raid. . .and other raid members joined in.
<Lasharus> Bugger. How long'll that be?
<Dumorimasoddaa> 250 secs +/- 5
<RobotPinkie> 06,15200 something seconds
<Lasharus> Ouch.
<Dumorimasoddaa> tell him to join with _ at the end of his name
<Lasharus> Oh well, I informed him on Skype.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15If he joins under another name, he'll be able to see when Arentius times out though
<Dumorimasoddaa> then just /nick the name back
<Lasharus> Eh, his internet's committing suicide on him, apparently.
<Lasharus> Oh damnit. Heroic modes.
<Dumorimasoddaa> and this is why you reg and ghost every pony
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah now he can join again :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and did.
<Arentius> i return!
<Lasharus> Welcome back!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Welcome back, Arentius
<Lasharus> Also, what do you mean Dumori?
<Arentius> thankies :)
<Dumorimasoddaa> register you nick with NickServe
<AllisZero> We suffered thru heroic Alysrazor last night
<Dumorimasoddaa> set it to ghost
<AllisZero> Two hours of pain, and people STILL getting hit by the nerfed tornadoes
<Dumorimasoddaa> then you can rejoin and it will auto kick the other name
<Dumorimasoddaa> but it works best if you have a dedicated irc client
<Dumorimasoddaa> want to know a random fact?
<Arentius> i'm almost out of tolerance for my net -.-
<DashWithRainbows> random fact :o
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, registering your nick is a good plan...
<Dumorimasoddaa> I dislike wow to play but I used to do builds
<Lasharus> I want to know a random fact.
<Dumorimasoddaa> in wrath
<Dumorimasoddaa> x3
<Lasharus> Can I register my nickname from this in-browser chat system?
<Lasharus> And neat Dumori. :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm gonna go play a bit, have fun everypony
<Dumorimasoddaa> full statistics ect
<DashWithRainbows> bye RobotPinkie!
<Arentius> bye pinkie!
<Lasharus> You too RobotPinkie :)
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and yeah I'm pretty sure you can, Lasharus
<Lasharus> ...I need to know commands. :P
<Dumorimasoddaa> I lost all my sheets when my PC ate it's self and couldn't be arsed to do them all again for Cat
<EspyLacopa> Fact: The Forsaken are douches.
<Dumorimasoddaa> plus you know patches make it a faff too
<Lasharus> Fact: Yup.
<Dumorimasoddaa> did the same for PvP and PvE guild wars builds
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I know :P Pretty sure it's /ns register PASSWORD EMAIL
<DashWithRainbows> Fact: you are currently using the internet
<RobotPinkie> 06,15or /msg nickserv register PASSWORD EMAIL
<Dumorimasoddaa> just /msg Nickserve help
<Dumorimasoddaa> get the full list of commands and such
<Lasharus> That one does nothing.
<Lasharus> (the help request)
<Dumorimasoddaa> humm odd
<RobotPinkie> 06,15it's because there was an additional E at the end
<prince-dari> Ok
<RobotPinkie> 06,15do /msg nickserv help
<prince-dari> We're going to do a little test.
<Dumorimasoddaa> oops added an e
<prince-dari> Can you see the stream?
<DashWithRainbows> one sec
<Dumorimasoddaa> is their cake at the end Dari
<Arentius> I cannot see the stream
<Rainbow-Dash> Yes I can Dari
<Arentius> do i fal?
<DashWithRainbows> yes
<Arentius> fail*
<Dumorimasoddaa> yeah
<Arentius> ....*sigh*
<Dumorimasoddaa> I can see
<Dumorimasoddaa> works
<EspyLacopa> Yup
<Luna> 07,01what do you see?
<Lasharus> Black.
<Luna> 07,01tell me tell me tell me!
<Dumorimasoddaa> blocky needing AA words
<EspyLacopa> Jonathon Creek
<DashWithRainbows> Jonathon creek
<Dumorimasoddaa> Jonathan Creek
<DashWithRainbows> now a sad naked clown
<EspyLacopa> Bewbies
<Luna> 07,01hows the quality?
<Lasharus> Fairly good.
<Dumorimasoddaa> a bit blocky luna
<Dumorimasoddaa> also why nude clowns
<EspyLacopa> Hmmmmm. A bit on the pixelated side.
<Arentius> no stream for me *sulk*
<Luna> 07,01arentius
<Luna> 07,01clear your cache
<Luna> 07,01and try again
<Arentius> okie dokes
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<prince-dari> I'll change quality.
<prince-dari> One sec.
*Luna twiddlethumbs
*VioletVanilla twiddlethumbs?
<EspyLacopa> Ok, no more movie, but what is there. . .text? Maybe?
<EspyLacopa> Too pixelated to read.
<DashWithRainbows> wait thumbs? WHAT BLACK MAGIC IS THIS!?!
<Lasharus> Okay, I'm now registered with this name.
<Lasharus> How do I 'log in', as it were?
<DashWithRainbows> you type /msg nickserv identify (your password)
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Lasharus> Ah.
<Arentius> ....luna has thumbs...she is luna it is allowed
<DashWithRainbows> password does not need brackets
<prince-dari> Luna, I dunno how we can change FMS to make the quality better.
<DashWithRainbows> for example
<Lasharus> Oh yes, there we go.
<Lasharus> Why did it need my e-mail address then?
<DashWithRainbows> ./msg nickserv identify 12345
<Lasharus> Yeah, it works.
<EspyLacopa> It's watchable, it just happens to be pixelated still.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So new streaming service?
<The_Flyin_King> wha
<The_Flyin_King> oh
<Lasharus> How does that whole ghost thing work then, while I"m at it?
<EspyLacopa> It looks as though it's being filtered through something that is forcing the resolution down to 240p or so.
<Lasharus> Might as well learn al I can, after all :)
<Arentius> Luna can i have the test link again please? :)
<Lasharus> I concur with the others though - it does seem a bit pixellated.
<Arentius> ty
<Arentius> it works
<Arentius> !
<Lasharus> :)
<Lasharus> That it does.
<EspyLacopa> On the plus side, it's not lagging.
<Lasharus> But as said - it seems a bit pixelly. Still, nice. :)
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The whole ghost thing is most likely done by /ns ghost USERNAME PASSWORD
<prince-dari> This is our own streaming service, set up FMS on Luna's spare PC.
<Arentius> it keeps freezing for me...though thats most likely my internet
<Dumorimasoddaa> it's ghost nick pass yeah
<kirzstryfe> so what do you do to register the nickname? had to refresh and missed that part
<RobotPinkie> 06,15or "/msg nickserv" instead of "/ns"
<Dumorimasoddaa> nick being the reg'd/grouped nick
<The_Flyin_King> What ghost thing?
<prince-dari> So, still some problems to work out.
<Dumorimasoddaa> /ns won;t work on some clients
<prince-dari> It will
<Arentius> its probably me with the lag Dari so exclude that for now unless someone else mentions it
<prince-dari> It's a network built in alias.
<The_Flyin_King> I've registered on equestria daily just not here because i'm more active at equestria
*Dumorimasoddaa 's client waves
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It depends on server, not client, Dumorimasoddaa
<prince-dari> It will work on every client.
<The_Flyin_King> same nickname
<Dumori> short name times
<RobotPinkie> 06,15so on this IRC server, /ns will always work
<EspyLacopa> It's /msg nickserv identify (your password)
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Dumori> and now you know my name is short for a longer one
<EspyLacopa> Oh, wait, that's for identify.
<Dumori> nope
<EspyLacopa> First use /msg nickserv register PASSWORD EMAIL
<Dumori> my client don't likey
<prince-dari> What client?
<Dumori> its a bastard of a client
<EspyLacopa> You'll have to do the identify when you log on each time.
<prince-dari> If it doesn't work, then your client is actively blocking it.
<prince-dari> Which is a stupid feature.
<Dumori> the fubar'd one I hacked up
<Dumori> yeah
<Dumori> I know
<Dumori> I'm not sure where that "feature" is in the code
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So what's streaming right now?
<Dumori> as only half the IRC code is my own
<prince-dari> I'm restreaming the first episode of Jonathon Creek. XD
<DashWithRainbows> RobotPinkie Jonathon Creek
<prince-dari> Since my hard drive isn't connected.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ooooh, nice
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I haven't seen this episode in... I dunno, couple of years I guess.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and here I was gonna go play games :P
<Dumori> not a creek fan tbh
<prince-dari> You suck. :P
*Dumori has decided that he's gonna use jawesome way too much
<RobotPinkie> 06,15:O
<Lasharus> A quick check - the test stream is running, but the actual stream's not started yet, right?
<DashWithRainbows> she has returned!
<DashWithRainbows> yes^
<prince-dari> What actual stream? O_o
<kirzstryfe> looks that way
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah House is in.... not sure how long
<prince-dari> Ah right.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15or is House on hold this week?
<Lasharus> About an hour and a half, I understood.
<Lasharus> (according to Luna)
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01>;3
<Luna> 07,01oui zat is correct
*Dumori isn't trying to work out an so jawesome face
<prince-dari> Yeah, I thought people were talking about an official stream.
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01hehe feel like being PinkiusPiacus for a bit!
<prince-dari> I was going to say, lawl, that's not till Friday.
<Dumori> /)^w^(\ so jawesome
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pinkius is best Piacus
<Dumori> it semi works
<Lasharus> Yay Luna. :)
<Lasharus> Thanks for confirming.
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01I'm in a Pinkie mood right now! Yippee!
<Lasharus> Uhoh.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pinkie mood is best mood!
<Dumori> I had caffine and I'm also no sleep hyper
<Lasharus> Yes, but two pinkies?
<Lasharus> The world will end...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Double Pinkie all the way across the sky?
<Dumori> Lasharus we normaly have 10 Flutters
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01PINKIE!
<DashWithRainbows> Lasharus as long as they discover caffeeine we will be okay
<Lasharus> Point taken Dumori.
<DashWithRainbows> dont discover*
<Dumori> caffeeine is best ien
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01Hehehee!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15omg, so intense!
<Revolver> I like caffeine
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01omai goodness!
<Arentius> keep the pinkies away from relentless
<Lasharus> This won't end well..

<RobotPinkamena> 06,15HENSHIN!
<DashWithRainbows> we can transform!?
<DoMorePinkie> cos I can make pun names
<Potato> :3
*RobotPinkamena sulks in a corner with his imaginary friends
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01Awwww

*PinkiusPiacus joins RobotPinkamena
*DoMorePinkie and ROCKS
*RobotPinkamena 's hair goes PFOOMF
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01Yay! -hugs RobotPinkie-
*RobotPinkie hugs PinkiusPiacus
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Much better, now.
*DoMorePinkie hugs PinkiusPiacus while still juggeling
<DoMorePinkie> I might just tag every pony song I have with the pony genre
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I need to keep practicing my contact juggling...
<DoMorePinkie> my name amuses me too much
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pony is a musical genre?
<Arentius> i wish i could contact juggle
<Arentius> I tried
<Arentius> i kept dropping it on my foot
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>tried
<Arentius> I'll stick to fire staff/flowersticks
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What you do is practice for months and months :P
<Arentius> i did
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I can barely do anything yet.
<Arentius> i crushed my foot 20 times
<Arentius> xD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15ouch, you need to start with a fairly sizeable stage ball, srsly :P
<DoMorePinkie> Juggeling is fun
<DoMorePinkie> I keep forgeting how IRL
<Arentius> i have a proper contact ball acrylic 160mm
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Starting with acrylic is a sure way to fail, pretty much
<DoMorePinkie> stupid dispraxia makes everything harder
<RobotPinkie> 06,15ouch, yeah, that's not fun when you drop it
<Arentius> i decided to start practicing over my bed
<DoMorePinkie> I couldn't catch a ball thrown at me till I was 12
<Arentius> so it goes fwumpf
<Arentius> instead of crunch
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You're good with flower sticks?
<LunaVi> 06Ohmy~
<Lasharus> Ouch.
<Arentius> Getting there
<Arentius> I can chain a few tricks together
<Arentius> I wouldn't say i'm great but i'm passable :0
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01hehehe
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<DoMorePinkie> I have all my martal based skills
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I can't juggle that well yet, so...
<Lasharus> My skill at juggling can best be described as not.
<DoMorePinkie> not very flashy though
<Arentius> juggling is also fun
<Lasharus> No ball sense whatsoever.
<LordCelestia> I am? Oh, thank you, you're all too kind. :D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I can do 3 clubs, decent flourish with each hand
<Arentius> Clubs annoy me
<Lasharus> I can try to juggle and drop all the balls immediately, if that helps.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Still, I'll always be an amateur
<Arentius> mainly cause i can't do them
<Arentius> but still
<Arentius> I'm going for my CRB in staff teaching soon
<DoMorePinkie> right now I can't juggel but I used to be able to trick juggle a full dice set
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol clubs are hard to start with, I got so many splinter hemorrhages the first couple of months
<DoMorePinkie> d4-d100
<RobotPinkie> 06,15CRB?
<DoMorePinkie> is harder than is sounds so small
<Arentius> teaching certificate
<DoMorePinkie> and they like to tumble and boune off you hands
<Arentius> I'll be legally allowed to charge people for lessons
<Arentius> and run workshops
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's really hard, DoMorePinkie, yeah, I couldn't do that
<DoMorePinkie> thats 7 dice
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I can't even do 5 balls yet :P
<DoMorePinkie> in air at once and doing those visral tricks
<AllisZero> EQD hits 50 million tomorrow woot
<DoMorePinkie> I don't know how I learnt that tick I must have gone eh this would look fun to do as a GM
<DoMorePinkie> and tryed
<DoMorePinkie> but I just tyhrow my dice around a room now
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I can barely do 4 balls, and not for more than 20 or so throws, lol
<Arentius> i evne geeked out so much i bought an ultrasaber to use for staff spinning xD
<DoMorePinkie> try a few d6
<DoMorePinkie> just 3
<Arentius> even*
<DoMorePinkie> its weird
<DoMorePinkie> they down like staing in you hands
<RobotPinkie> 06,15that's cool, Arentius, lol
<Arentius> 3d6 isn't too bad
<Arentius> ;D
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> Stabbed her.
<DoMorePinkie> hehe
<Lasharus> Sorry if my activity drops a bit for now btw guys.
<DoMorePinkie> I just know basic poll arm fighting
<Lasharus> I'm sorta in mid-raid just now, so yeah. Apparently they need me :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah 3 dice is pretty easy, I do that all the time during pen and paper games...
<Arentius> staff fighting is fun too
<DoMorePinkie> from bo-staff to pike
<DoMorePinkie> most useless skills EVER
<Arentius> hardly
<DoMorePinkie> hwo ofthen do I need to use a pike
<Arentius> Go to a public place with a friend then duel
<Arentius> get crowd
<Arentius> filmed
<Arentius> youtube fame
<RobotPinkie> 06,15When the zombie apocalypse comes, DoMorePinkie?
<Arentius> become richer than rebecca black
<Arentius> ??????
<Arentius> profit
<DoMorePinkie> I mean bo-staff and quater staff I get
<DoMorePinkie> but why did I learn bills and pikes ect
<DoMorePinkie> I'm also a passable warsword duelest
<DoMorePinkie> mostly self taught
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah I can't do anything like that
<DoMorePinkie> but one of my ex's is a renactor so I learnt more of him
<RobotPinkie> 06,15some basic staff twirling, no fighting :P
<DoMorePinkie> and I'm a wanna be pro fencer
<prince-dari> Hm, I tried fencing a couple times.
<DoMorePinkie> I like fighting
<Arentius> if you can twirl a staff you can fight with one, the two skills transitio well
<DoMorePinkie> it's fun
<prince-dari> Once in France.
<prince-dari> So hot.
<DoMorePinkie> oh yeah
<prince-dari> Full suit + helmet.
<DoMorePinkie> try a 15 min bout in that
<prince-dari> X_X
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hmmm, maybe Arentius, but I'm betting it still takes a lot of practice to get really good
<DoMorePinkie> while moive up and down the peice liek a daemon
<Arentius> Oh most definately Robotpinkie...i've concussed myself more than once
<DoMorePinkie> I've spent most of today training
<EspyLacopa> Nooo, the site I used for downloading MLP:FiM episodes collapsed.
<Lasharus> This comes as no surprise...
<DoMorePinkie> as I've been out of comissiopn with survier migraines
<Arentius> solid aluminium cores + 100ml kevlar wicks on wet ground do not mix well
<DoMorePinkie> for 18 months
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I've gotten some really nasty bruises from juggling clubs, but I don't get them much anymore thankfully
<EspyLacopa> At least the clubs weren't on fire.
<DoMorePinkie> I have scars from epee duels
<Arentius> Not seen anyone really hurt themselves with clubs yet
<Lasharus> Really shouldn't have clicked that link. :P
<Lasharus> Yay chatroom breakage.
<prince-dari> Hah, I have some pretty good scars.
<DoMorePinkie> from my right wrist all the way up to my armpit
<RobotPinkie> 06,15They're pretty well padded, the practice clubs, but they travel at pretty high speeds
<DoMorePinkie> it's just fencing scars are rare bar accidents with all that gear
<DoMorePinkie> but it was from a massive friction burn
<RobotPinkie> 06,15seen someone get a really nasty split in the lower lip, but yeah, nothing that won't heal :P
<DoMorePinkie> hehe
<Lasharus> Don't be so sure RobotPinkie.
<Arentius> Worst injury i saw is someone hitting themself in the face with a light fire staff
<DoMorePinkie> I've had to stich my own wounds before
<Lasharus> Arentius here hit himself in the face repeatedly. "nothing that won't heal"?
<Revolver> I haven't
<Arentius> -.-
<DoMorePinkie> was to the bone on my leg
<Lasharus> *grin*
<Arentius> die in a fire....of tolerance
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Fire clubs aren't so bad though
<Lasharus> IT BURNS WITH KINDNESS!
<DoMorePinkie> healed neatly too but I did go the A&E with it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15just... don't use them before you're fairly handy with the practice clubs :P
<DoMorePinkie> x3
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<DoMorePinkie> but but but
<DoMorePinkie> FIRE
<DoMorePinkie> so pretty
<prince-dari> Fire's fun for all the family. :D
<Lasharus> Spoken like a true arsonist.
<Arentius> I burned myself during a burnoff once...fireballs kinda turned into fire pillars half my height, scorched both arms xD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, I mean just doing a 3 club cascade with fire clubs looks awesome
<DoMorePinkie> it hurts, it warms it even lights up the room it's new FIRE!
<DoMorePinkie> has a hint of pyromania
<RobotPinkie> 06,15ouch, Arentius, that sounds painful
<EspyLacopa> How about a whip lit on fire?
<prince-dari> You can't really resist it though, you have something flammable, and a lighter. *set hand on fire*
<Arentius> It isn't so bad RobotPinkie, i only lost my arm hair xD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol oh okay
<MoonDasher> ^owch
<Arentius> not like my friend who set his head on fire
<Arentius> muppet forgot to soak his hair in water
<prince-dari> Well, that sucks.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I need to get some fire clubs, but the good ones are so expensive :(
<Arentius> firetoys.co.uk has decent prices
<DoMorePinkie> hehe
*MoonDasher has an entire arsenal in my attic basement to suit all your needs.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah I want a special set though... :P
<DoMorePinkie> Hair smells funny after being exposed to fire
<Arentius> you can get special sets from firetoys >.>
<DoMorePinkie> I shoudl know I used to have hair down to my waist
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I'll have a look
<Lasharus> Always fun.
<prince-dari> Is anyone currently on the stream, or should I end it?
<Arentius> well...they range from £17-30 per torch
<Arentius> maybe not
<LunaShy> 07,01I think you may end it
<LunaShy> 07,01since no pony responded
<prince-dari> Ok.
<MoonDasher> im not on the stream, i wasnt aware you were streaming
<DashWithRainbows> yeah you should end it, i lost interest in the first 3 minutes
<Arentius> OOO firetoys updated their flame dyes
<prince-dari> Pfft, if you don't like Jonathan Creek, you suck.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15it went offline? :(
<LunaShy> 07,01lol..
<prince-dari> Well no one was watching it?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I was watching, damn... oh well :P
<Zephirdd> hay guys
<DashWithRainbows> prince-dari i have A.D.D so i do lose interest quite easily/quickly
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'll look up the rest on youtube
<kirzstryfe> Zeph's back, quick, everypony hide
<prince-dari> Well I'll leave it on anyway.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yay! Thanks
<mib_m4vl9s> o hai
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and yeah, they don't have the torches I want to buy, unfortunately, though good prices.
<Zephirdd> lol stryfe
<Arentius> pity :9
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's a VERY special design I'm after, you can modify the flame mid juggle
<Arentius> they have fire swords though
<Arentius> *is tempted
<Arentius> oo cool
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Costs maybe 10 pounds extra, but I think it'll be worth it
<Zephirdd> So
<Zephirdd> anyone read this yet? http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/story-dairies-of-equestrian-overlord.html
<Lasharus> Yup.
<Lasharus> Quite amusing.
<Zephirdd> god I loved it
<Arentius> for only £10? deffo
<Arentius> I want that flame dye though
<Arentius> Green flame would be awesome
<Zephirdd> and I hate the fanon side he followed, of the troll crazy Celestia
<Zephirdd> D:
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well it's £10 extra per club, compared to pro torches
<Arentius> still worth it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, yeah. I just have to find them again. Used to be sold at a Swedish juggling store
<Flutterz> Hi everypony :D
<Arentius> always a pain when yo ulose them :(
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I know it was a Swedish brand, too, but I don't remember the name :(
<Arentius> the shops down here all stopped stocking juggling equipment
<DashWithRainbows> hey Flutterz
<Arentius> gotta go to oddballs now
<RobotPinkie> 06,15There's pretty much one juggling store in Stockholm, lawl
<FlaschenJoe11> Evening
<Zephirdd> hi flaschen
<Arentius> lo flutterz and flaschen
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hay Flutterz, FlaschenJoe11
<Zephirdd> oh and flutterz
<Zephirdd> kinda missed
<Zephirdd> :P
<Flutterz> it happens :P
<DoMorePinkie> I love capital cities, they always have the best niche shops.
<DoMorePinkie> well mostly
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, though they can be hard to find
<DoMorePinkie> yeah
<DoMorePinkie> I know
<Flutterz> just found out the the second win7 that i got in a row from ebay is fake >.<
<DoMorePinkie> the fencign supply shop in London is a reall bitch to get too
<Flutterz> gonna have to get the person to give me a refund, again
<DoMorePinkie> but I'm very tempted by a for and epee both french grip
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm always tempted to buy more juggling stuff, hehe
<Arentius> you and me both Robotpinkie
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm like a kid in a candy store when I go there, so much fun stuff
<Arentius> same i could live in oddballs
<Violet> 06Für Tod und Deutschland!!!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15:O
*Violet runs as she launches herself off the cliffs of dover
<DoMorePinkie> http://www.leonpaul.com/ I could this site for days. So much quailty and such
*Arentius puts a trampoline under violet
<DoMorePinkie> just you know expencive sport really
<RobotPinkie> 06,15yay more Jonathan Creek!
<Lasharus> Bwuh?
<DoMorePinkie> plus I'm an amidexrus guy so I need to buy at least two of each blade type I use to trian fully
<DoMorePinkie> :z
*FlaschenJoe11 shrugs to the actions of Violet "I have no Idea what she's doing."
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh wow, you too?
<Arentius> you have to be ambi to be a juggler
<DoMorePinkie> lookign at £30 per blade not including the grips ect
<DoMorePinkie> going cheapest
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not really, no, most jugglers just practice twice as hard with their left hand :P
<Arentius> i'm left handed so HAH!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I have to practice slightly more with my right, though
<prince-dari> >assuming everyone is right handed
<prince-dari> <_<
<prince-dari> >_>
<DoMorePinkie> I'm technicaly no handed
<DoMorePinkie> I'm sure
<DoMorePinkie> due to my dyspraxia
<Arentius> the awkward moment when most of bronystate is actually lefthanded
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol "most" meaning exactly that, prince-dari
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Most jugglers are right handed, the rest are mostly left handed, precious few are ambidextrous :P
<Arentius> you mean like any given population? :P
<Zephirdd> lol I liked Art of the Dress rock version
<DoMorePinkie> dyspaxia is a fun disability the lack of co-ordination, the lisp I love it.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pretty much, yeah
<DoMorePinkie> evey thing I can do with either hand has to be fully taught
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm ambidextrous, used to rely more on my left hand than my right, but one of my teachers flipped out on me over it one time too many....
<Lasharus> Lefthanded.
<DoMorePinkie> for example I cant write left handend but I can shoot and fence
<RobotPinkie> 06,15She was very religious, which was probably connected :P
<DoMorePinkie> I eat left handed.
<Arentius> its ok Robot, we're all agents of the devil here
<Arentius> ...pink candyfloss filled devils
<DoMorePinkie> Also being an ambi fencer is the ULTIMATE troll
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, good to know Arentius
<Arentius> ;)
<DoMorePinkie> right v left is a bitch for the one not used to it
<DoMorePinkie> and left vs left is also a bithc for pure left fencers
<DoMorePinkie> as they are used to the guard being on line all the time
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah... people don't like southpaws :P
<Zephirdd> Nadal is OP on Tennins
<DoMorePinkie> thus you can legaly swap hands to troll for best advatage in a torny
<Zephirdd> because of southpaw
<Arentius> I loved swordfighting as a lefty...it annoyed everyone
*tdubellz parties
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and they like it even less when you start out in orthodox stance...
<DoMorePinkie> yeah Arentius its better ambi
<DoMorePinkie> as you can then make the leftys hate you too
<DoMorePinkie> ;)
<DoMorePinkie> it's also really nice with a warsword
<DoMorePinkie> as I can flip my stances on demand with no real weakness on my part
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't do any kind of sword fighting though, obviously...
<DoMorePinkie> with archery it's a useless skill
<DoMorePinkie> same more or less with rifles
<DoMorePinkie> how did I do that dice set juggle
<DoMorePinkie> they are so light I cant launch them one by one
<MantisToboggan> i like pony
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wouldn't know, DoMorePinkie :P
<DoMorePinkie> I know I've done it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15hold the others down, presumably
<DoMorePinkie> as my old group calls me out to do it now and again
<DoMorePinkie> yeah but 7!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I have to do that when I juggle 3 dice...
<Spyrorocks[Air]> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well it's just 4 in one hand maximum, shouldn't be TOO hard to hold :P
<DoMorePinkie> I think I manage to lauch them i god damn numerical order too
<DoMorePinkie> I'm so annyoed at thsi old tick now
<RobotPinkie> 06,15hopefully last bit of Jonathan creek before House starts...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'd think the biggest problem would be trajectory
<DoMorePinkie> ugh I can't even relaunch the d4 the fecking wobbley bitch
<RobotPinkie> 06,15very hard to control the flight path of something so light and uneven
<Dashite> RAAAGE!
<Dashite> MUST KILL BOSS!
<Dashite> RAWR!
<DoMorePinkie> I can get flight path as I never did the tick that wide
<DoMorePinkie> its making the dice not fly off my hand when they land point down
<Arentius> gah
<AllisZero> Still the talk of juggling things?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh okay, but with 7? You'd have to get a pretty high arch...
<Arentius> i'm going to use the stare on virgin media if i get my hands on them
<Arentius> sorry bout that :P
<DoMorePinkie> yeah
<DoMorePinkie> high but wide won't work too small
<Lasharus> Did your net die again Alex?
<Arentius> if anyone said anything to me you'll need to repeat it
<Arentius> yeah
<Lasharus> :(
<DoMorePinkie> Arentius you're and Alex too
<Arentius> Indeed
<Lasharus> Yeah, sorry, it's a habit to call him Alex. We've known eachother a while now :P
<Arentius> a while is a bit of an understatement
*DoMorePinkie can't even two d20's right now
<DoMorePinkie> hehe
<DoMorePinkie> my name is as much Alexander as it is Dumorimasoddaa now
<Arentius> *high fives*
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> Suck his face off with that hoover.
<DoMorePinkie> am honstly concidering adding Dumorimasoddaa to my name as a middle name
<RobotPinkie> 06,15oh lawd
<Arentius> just don't do what that finnish guy did
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...ever?
<DoMorePinkie> lol
<Arentius> he changed his legal name to "rainbow alexis dash"
<DoMorePinkie> I know
<Arentius> thats just too far if you ask me :P
<DoMorePinkie> but nah Dumori has been my name for years
<Arentius> fair play
<DoMorePinkie> it's more or less my name in my head
<DoMorePinkie> and its a completely unique string
<DoMorePinkie> I'm the only person on earth ever to use it
<DoMorePinkie> thats oddly cool
<Arentius> :P just a bit
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Man, my inverse cascade kinda blows now... should practice more with balls.
<Arentius> inverse cascades are fun
<DoMorePinkie> it's technicaly a discordian name
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, really hard when you start out though.
<Arentius> true
<Arentius> Mills still makes me rage
<DoMorePinkie> but seeing as most discorsian's randomly gen their name or parts of it
<Arentius> as do takeouts
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pillars are the trickiest for me, just to get them completely straight each time
<kirzstryfe> so what are you raiding right now?
<Arentius> haven;t tried pillars....i can throw a ball under my leg in the middle of a cascade...thats about it xD
<DoMorePinkie> also have a link to how I made my name. http://armistis.com/en/generator/
<DoMorePinkie> it's a fun program if you need random name ideas
<DoMorePinkie> it;s very customisable you can get to much more than random sayable strings
<Arentius> I prefer inventing my own names :P
<DoMorePinkie> hehe
<RobotPinkie> 06,15looks good, but yeah, I like trying to think up names... or writing my own random name generators :P
<DoMorePinkie> same but it's grown alot form the early days when I first used it
<Lasharus> Firelands.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15only two more parts, I think
<Lasharus> Specifically: Majordomo Staghelm.
<Lasharus> (slow response, I know. Sorry kirzstryfe :P)
<kirzstryfe> np
<kirzstryfe> saw a vid on that fight a while back, mechanics didn't impress me much :S
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, his conclusions are flawless.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Suddenly, silence
<Arentius> sshhhh relish in this unique opportunity :P
<Diftraku> http://i.imgur.com/NYM7i.png
<Diftraku> http://i.imgur.com/w82RF.png
<Diftraku> behold
<Dashite> I'm hunting wabbits.
<Diftraku> Products of my boredom
<Diftraku> Based on http://derpy.me/nKHA7
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol I was wondering what the logo was based off
<RobotPinkie> 06,15love the Derpy
<Diftraku> I felt it needed derpy, since the colors and the bubbles are mainly from Derpy
<Lasharus> It's actually reasonably well done.
<Lasharus> The heroic mode is quite nasty though.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What is her cutie mark, anyway?
<Diftraku> bubblewrap
<Diftraku> :P
<kirzstryfe> didn't see heroic mode, but isn't normal half saber lash, half meteor-type damage?
<Diftraku> Or that's how I read it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol makes sense
<DashWithRainbows> something to
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I figured it was snow or something, but I'm not sure how that'd make sense...
<Arentius> I thought it ws just bubbles
<Arentius> not bublewrap >.>
<Dashite> It is.
<Arentius> bubblewrap works if she becomes a mailmare
<Diftraku> Derpy = Mailmare in my headcanon :P
<EspyLacopa> Closest I came to raiding was a few runs killing trash to get enough rep for the fancy cloak.
<Arentius> well lauren said she liked the name (i think) and also DJ-pon3 stuck
<Arentius> so maybe she'll be a mailmare too!
<Arentius> and maybe they made dinky ;D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, Feeling Pinkie Keen would seem to support that
<prince-dari> Personally I hope they don't include any fanon.
<prince-dari> And that's how they seem to be going.
<Arentius> they already have after a fashion
<Arentius> nothing majore..but i think names are going in some places
<Arentius> i doubt they'd take our entire idea of certain characters
<prince-dari> So far just DJ-Pon3.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15There are so many different fanons, so
<prince-dari> And that's a character most likely not returning.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't think they'll go further than the occasional nod
<Arentius> and Derpy...lauren mentioned her name ages ago and said she wouldnt want to take the name from the fanbase
<DSDSuinidestay> hm
<Arentius> but they never said if she'd be more then that
<Arentius> so *shrug*
<DSDSuinidestay> were the hell is he
<prince-dari> Lauren said she'd be happy for her to be called Derpy, but it's never come up in the show.
<prince-dari> So it's not really canon.
<Arentius> thats the one
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Ditzy*
<Arentius> I couldn't remember exactyl
<prince-dari> No Val.
<MoonDasher> ^that would be so awesome)
<Arentius> and I also prefer Ditzy
<prince-dari> The original name was Ditzy Doo.
<prince-dari> But Lauren said she'd be happy for her to be called Derpy.
<Arentius> Derpy just seems derogatory imo
<Diftraku> Ditzy "Derpy" Doo
<prince-dari> I prefer Derpy to be honest.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, she said that if she were to assign Ditzy Doo a character, that it would be Derpy
<LunaShy> 07,01NOTICE
<LunaShy> 07,01in 30 mins House Starts
<Diftraku> Good point
<Arentius> yar i remember that Val
<DashWithRainbows> better get some snacks ready then...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Jonathan Creek is almost done
<Diftraku> Gaaaah
<Diftraku> Why is dA taking so long on processing my upload
<prince-dari> "From Fyre-Flye (Lauren Faust) – "Ha! I lurk around a bit and I noticed the Derpy phenomenon. As far as I know, her wall eyed moment was an accident -- or perhaps a layout artist entertaining him/herself. Who knows? Background ponies have no name, and their butt symbols are picked at random, so she can be Derpy if everyone likes. A later episode references a less-than-intelligent local pegasus named “Ditzy Doo” so maybe she can be her if we ever need to show her. But I would not want to step on everyone’s Derpy love.""
<Dashite> Because it hates you.
<prince-dari> "Background ponies have no name, and their butt symbols are picked at random, so she can be Derpy if everyone likes"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 when was this in comparison to the other comment?
<Diftraku> But really, everypony has their own names for the ponies
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I like that she calls cutie marks "butt symbols"
<Diftraku> :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15This should be canon
<Dashite> Word of God. It is canon. :p
<Arentius> cutie marks are hereafter renamed butt symbols
<Arentius> let it be done!
<Spyrorocks[Air]> who?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lawl, timing
<kirzstryfe> hehe
<Arentius> xD
<PinkiusPiacus> 08,01:D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15"she's using the evil voice!"
