<DaringDerpy> the special effects guy really loves his bw flashes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So much flashing.
<FlaschenJoe11> DoctoDoctorWho: But not from the wounds against Destoroyah. He basically lost against a walking corpse
<Vordox> USe DEPTHCHARGED IDIOT HUMANS
<RosePetal> lol you think you can shoot giant shark.
<DoctoDoctorWho> FlaschenJoe11: due to events directly correlating to that fight
<CriticKitten> >shooting their guns
<CriticKitten> >target is underwater
<Lil_B> that's quite a fight we don't see
<RosePetal> Who keeps flashing that flash cannon?!
<Alchemist> did they use stock footage of cruisers?
<DerpyMuffins> Inb4 seizure
<Michael> silly merica...

<Buytoast> oh wow
<Kandarihu> DerpyMuffins, HECK no!
<FlaschenJoe11> DoctoDoctorWho: nope. He was gonna die from a nuclear reaction. Which he absorbed Before Destoroyah became that powerful. So, Even without D there, G would have died.
<TKist> Murica:D
<CriticKitten> What, we don't even get to see it eaten? What, did the shark jumping to eat the airplane eat up all the movie budget too?
<Apokalipse> That ship had less than 2 minutes of screen time
<RosePetal> No, I wanted to see the Giant shark.
<SirGanjalf> Rise and shine mr. Freeman...
<Lil_B> well... their budget didn't allow for satifying action
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: most likely, yes
<Michael> SWAT!
<CriticKitten> Doubletap!
<Vordox> 'MURICA
<Crippler> chill out guysm they're just paintball guns
<CriticKitten> Damnit
<RosePetal> Suddenly the SWAT.
<SirGanjalf> wat
<Invi> FlaschenJoe11, but if godzilla wasn't radiated he wouldn't hav ethe power to kill D
<RosePetal> Deal with It.
<Crippler> ho ho ho
<CriticKitten> Even the army guys are stereotypical.
<TKist> ^
<Kandarihu> That shark is going to take an airplane... AND EAT IT!
<FlaschenJoe11> Invi: And the Army could have killed him due to Weaksauce Weakness.
<TKist> :D
<CriticKitten> AMERICANS
<DerpyMuffins> How did the shark get mega again?
<Apokalipse> aliens
<DerpyMuffins> I missed most of th emovie
<Shootaloo> wasnt this soldier one of the suit guys?
<Deacon> I'm guessing this movie's a stinker eh?
<Brony2447> hai bronystate :)
<Sundaysmile> because its megalodon
<RosePetal> If this is Treasure Island, where is the Treasure?!
<Vordox> DerpyMuffins: It's Extinct,. :P Old shark kind
<SirGanjalf> Yes, we know, he's irish
<Deacon> ello Brony2447
<Crippler> Uncle Sam needs you to kill a shark.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Brony2447. :)
<Michael> hai Brony2447!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Brony2447.
<DaringDerpy> it's a dinosaur, frozen in a glacier for 80 million years, DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Brony2447
<Invi> hi Brony2447
<RosePetal> We get it, you are Irish!
<Lil_B> hey Brony2447
<CriticKitten> Katrina?
<Sundaysmile> Sharktopus owns this movie
<CriticKitten> Wat.
<Epicmetalfreak> DerpyMuffins: Because he lived 1.5 million years ago and yet reappeared through global warming ;P
<DerpyMuffins> That is a very bad excuse for a monster
<Crippler> haw haw haw
<Brony2447> how are all yall
<CriticKitten> ....oh, he's Japanese.
<CriticKitten> That explains the squid.
<RosePetal> He was created by Supa Radition.
<SirGanjalf> -Like Katrina? -No, like Tsunami:|
<Vordox> DerpyMuffins: Never seen the masterpiece Aliens vs Predators?
<Lil_B> Seppuku?
<TKist> Welcome to HELL Brony2447
<Michael> Brony2447: nice, and you? :)
<DerpyMuffins> Yes I have Vordox
<CriticKitten> Tentacles for the Japanese, yay :D
<RosePetal> Evil drink decaf.
<MadSurge> Vordox: those movies, urgh
<Crippler> This dude is the burn master
<Vordox> If you've seen that, MONSTERS can survive in ice :P
<Brony2447> Michael: good! :) i just made another MLP hand sketch
<CriticKitten> Seismic suction?
<DerpyMuffins> Of course in every monster movie there is a japanese
<Lil_B> Stereotypical Army douche guy :/ i despy these characters
<CriticKitten> Wat
<RosePetal> IT'S TRUE.
<Lil_B> despise*
<Buytoast> oh boy, this guy is ridiculous
<CriticKitten> That is not a thing.
<Kandarihu> Lil_B, agreed
<Michael> Brony2447: omg nice :$
<Invi> Vordox, but alien can survive anywhere. your argument is invalid ^^
<CriticKitten> I refuse to believe that "seismic suction" is a thing
<DerpyMuffins> Here is the asshole we all know
<Brony2447> TKist: btw i've been to hell before, it's very nice now
<Lil_B> Kandarihu even in comedies where they do it intentionally I hate it
<Vordox> Invi: Never seen Godzilla'? He was frozen for several decades :P
<CriticKitten> Unless perhaps "seismic suction" refers to this movie
<RosePetal> Oh no Earth has Chicken Pox!
<TKist> yay
<DerpyMuffins> How do we know its a he?
*TKist Hugs Brony2447
<Brony2447> TKist: :) thx
<Eli> they just touch the CD surface
<Brony2447> hades treats me real good
<TKist> Welcome brotha
<CriticKitten> ....wat
<Vordox> DESTRUUUCTIIOOON
<Vordox> 'MUErICA
<CriticKitten> Yes, you fucking can
<SirGanjalf> Don
<Invi> yes the candy man can
<DoctoDoctorWho> FlaschenJoe11: yes, but the more he used that power, the more his meltdown accelerated. Due to the ENORMOUS amounts of energy it took to put down destroyah(with the help of a suddenly competent military force no less!), Destroyah's actions led to his immediate demise after the fight. Otherwise, he would have lasted alot longer.
<CriticKitten> They're giant monsters that want to KILL US. Containment? Screw that.
<DerpyMuffins> Of course america wants to 'entrap' the monsters
<kinixys> Gonna need a bigger pokeball.
<CriticKitten> Shell them to death
<SirGanjalf> "Don't you bleedin' heart liberals tell me what can i annihilate:|"
<DerpyMuffins> Its shoot to kill, not contain
<TKist> kinixys :D
<RosePetal> What about Russia?
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<Apokalipse> Use the whole worlds population as bait
<CriticKitten> Naval Intelligence? Dat oxymoron
<kinixys> Apokalipse: XD
<Invi> they could sell taht shark to japan
<SirGanjalf> but, tbh, trying to contain them isn't a smart idead
<RosePetal> Look at all those buttons!
<Lil_B> sounds like hes taslking about the USA
<Brony2447> lol wtf treasure island
<RosePetal> You just said this.
<Sundaysmile> SCIENCE MONTAGE!!!
<Kandarihu> You know what? The stereotype has a point. The monsters cannot be contained, and are killing innocent people.
<DerpyMuffins> inb4 they only kill the squid to make kalimari
<Vordox> SUDDENLy
<Vordox> SCIENCE
<DerpyMuffins> Wtf?
<DerpyMuffins> Now its science?
<Ryunosuke> https://twitter.com/tarastrong/status/264548653878898688/photo/1 - tara strong drinking coffee ... naked :)
<Invi> Lil_B, is that accuarte what they are doing?
<Vordox> OH NLO
<Vordox> PURPLE LIQUID
<RosePetal> No.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Invi: nah, they'd be more interested in the octopus, if ya know what I mean
<Ryunosuke> and then everyone clicked
<Epicmetalfreak> We need to continue... "Testing"
<SirGanjalf> cue stock science montage music
<Michael> giant monsters: resolve it with science
<FlaschenJoe11> DoctoDoctorWho: I'm not saying Destoroyah isn't one of the strongest enemies Godzilla ever had. Just that the MGs always did more damage to him.
<Lil_B> well, they write Stuff down, thats the first step towards real science
<Alchemist> Invi: of course it is :D
<kinixys> Team of crackshot scientists. Testubes.. Scientists!
<Apokalipse> Oh something explode already
<Yahooz> Ah, back for this perfect movie
<RosePetal> Wonder if that is juice.
<XxNightHawk64xX> ok idk if this is offensive (sorry if it is) but what is a furry
<Apokalipse> Hey Yahooz
<Invi> DoctoDoctorWho, hehe true
<TKist> Dafuq
<Michael> ohai Yahooz
<RosePetal> Too tired must dream of giant shark.
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Yahooz
<Vordox> <---- The reason why B Movie is in BMN, it's GOOD :p
<Lil_B> I say we gave the mÂ³ of Ambien
<DerpyMuffins> So why did the movie now suddenly go into science?
<Yahooz> inb4 Ohmai

<Yahooz> TKist: pretty good. just saw Argo
<Lil_B> Invi STuff them full of stuff to make them sleep
<DaringDerpy> XxNightHawk64xX: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom they get no respect on the internets
<Eli> flirt flirt
<TKist> Like asir
<FlaschenJoe11> DoctoDoctorWho: (\ That we can.
<Epicmetalfreak> XxNightHawk64xX: HArd to explain. It is a fandom that likes Animals. They are even more hated than bronies and are beeing accused the same things as we bronies.
<RosePetal> If you know what I mean.
<DerpyMuffins> This movie doesnt make transistions well do they?
<RosePetal> It's Asylum what do you expect?

<Dark92Enigma> Eli: SORRY took too long
<RosePetal> My god... it's not working.
<ekips> underwater FLAK?
<Michael> all the fails
<Boulderdash> It would be cooler if the shark had a laser beam attached to its forehead.
<Yahooz> Flash boom
<CriticKitten> "We can't see! Let's shoot some more until we can!"
<Kandarihu> Vordox, please don't compare these morons with my country.
<Sundaysmile> stealth shark

<CriticKitten> Apparently a US Destroyer is equally as wide as the Golden Gate Bridge
<FlaschenJoe11> Dark92Enigma: you win
<Kandarihu> Vordox, so are you charging that Americans really ARE like these moronic seamen?
<RosePetal> It's the Kraken wearing a Shark puppet on its hand.
<Dark92Enigma> TARGET LOST? HE'S BITNG A FUCKING BRIDGE
<SpeccyRush> FlaschenJoe11: it is bigger then a Battleship
<RosePetal> How do you not see this?

<RosePetal> CURSE YOUUUUUUUU SHARRRRRRRRKKKK!
<Roseluck`> because the japanese always fight giant monsters, Kandarihu, havent you seen godzilla?
<Vordox> FlaschenJoe11: I'm not native English :P
<Crippler> I like that guy just standing there with a automatic rifle
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They've tested underwater nukes w/o problems.
<CriticKitten> Stop pretending that you know how science works, movie
<Dark92Enigma> They acknowledged their movie was so bad, they said just that <--------------
<Sundaysmile> Fuck'a'yuuuuuuuuu sharku!!!!
<RosePetal> Bad Reception.

<CriticKitten> What is this, The Ring? Stop flashing!
<FlaschenJoe11> Vordox: I can understand that. me neither
<kinixys> CriticKitten: I knows! they have test tubes!
<Kandarihu> Roseluck`, there's a rather nasty whaling program going on by the Japanese government.
<Yahooz> ya givin me seizures
<Crippler> oh no, flashes of shit we already saw!
<Boulderdash> dem eyes
<RosePetal> Bad dream?
<Sundaysmile> did her family get eaten by wild megalodons?
<Eli> CriticKitten: all they know is how flashes work... and not even that very well
<Dark92Enigma> I WOULD say the BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT joke, but this is somehow contributing to the plot.........
<RosePetal> Whut?
<TKist> Bitch to the KITCHEN!!!:D
<CriticKitten> ....
<Vordox> GENIUS STRIKE
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord well, that were normal nukes, just tested underwater, to keep damage and radiation down, but the tidal wavers are still very hazardous to both landslides and ships
<Boulderdash> da fuq?
<CriticKitten> Then just say that
<Yahooz> Jeezus Fahck
<SpeccyRush> wrong use of ZNNT!
<Sundaysmile> VERSUS MODE
<CriticKitten> Why would you say "Rilla in Manilla"?
<Yahooz> AVIATORS
<Michael> never thinked of that!?
<CriticKitten> That's the stupidiest line ever uttered
*DaringDerpy has a seizure
<Yahooz> Hormones
<RosePetal> BRILLANT IT MAKES NOT SENSE!
<Dark92Enigma> By the way the Shark is a MEGALODON.......but that's no excuse for biting off a plane, and a fucking bridge
<d3rb_> CriticKitten, thriller
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not from nukes. The waves would disperse before hitting land.
<Roseluck`> :3
*TKist takes drugs and nukes whales
<Roseluck`> this is AWESOME
<CriticKitten> "They're natural enemies!"
<Dark92Enigma> Stop trying to be sciency! It kills me! just do the fight, I'm sure people will pay for maximum bloodbath with minimum talk
<DerpyMuffins> They gonna 'come' together alright
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Waves would only be a problem near the explosion.
<CriticKitten> No, they're not.
<CriticKitten> They're a shark and an octopus.
<CriticKitten> They are NOT natural enemies.
<Boulderdash> laws of physics?
<Yahooz> Animals can hate too
<RosePetal> NO MORE SCIENCE TALK!
<Vordox> Laws of Physic?
<Vordox> Got to do with animals
<Vordox> what?
<SpeccyRush> uh the ice age wasnt instant
<Pinkies4thWall|BL2> A Shocktopus?
<DerpyMuffins> WTF DOES PHYSICS HAVE TO DO?
<Michael> merica
<TKist> FINLAND!
<Boulderdash> this movie hurts my science.
<Epicmetalfreak> punshes wronskopp
<RosePetal> Nobody.
<CriticKitten> ....they're adapting to SONAR?
<Crippler> moral of the story: hate solves our problems.
<CriticKitten> That makes no sense
<DaringDerpy> a pony?
<Vordox> FREE WORLD?
<Vordox> HAHAHAHAHAH
<Buytoast> physics
<Buytoast> ahaha
<wronskopp> punshes Epicmetalfreak
<Alchemist> someone just call Fluttershy already...
<wronskopp> e`:
<RosePetal> Or at least a battle.
<Sundaysmile> the Mariana Trench!
*TKist PUNCHES EVERYONE
<Dark92Enigma> DerpyMuffins: By the way you mean WMC (Worst Movie Clause)..........and i say, this movie is unimpressive and lame, but it's not worthy of the clause
<Vordox> Sundaysmile: Too deep
<Sundaysmile> but it's metal
<SirGanjalf> They need to go deeper?
<Lil_B> well... these 2 monsters are unstopable forces, according to the Movies understanding of physics and Logic, this should create a black hole
<CriticKitten> These monsters are immune to sonar, so I guess they're screwed now
<kinixys> This movie is pretty funny, but I don't think we need to watch it again after this.
<SpeccyRush> DEPPER EH? http://inception.davepedu.com/
<Dark92Enigma> SirGanjalf: OR DERPER 6_9
<CriticKitten> I don't know HOW one becomes immune to sonar but apparently they are
<Michael> Lil_B: it makes sense <_<
<RosePetal> Whuts with these colors.
<Vordox> SpeccyRush: No non image links
<Vordox> :P
<Yahooz> 10 points to SpeccyRush for that button
<Lil_B> Michael in this movie it does
<DerpyMuffins> I have never once seen a joy stick on a submarine
<TKist> DUN DUN DUUUN

<Invi> ekips, no, vote for transmorphers next :D
<CriticKitten> Do you see his glasses?
<Kandarihu|GreenHair> ekips, I don't want to see this movie again.
<CriticKitten> They're impractically small
<DerpyMuffins> Godzilla made more sense than this
<SpeccyRush> next B movie should be sharktopus
<CriticKitten> They're not even an inch tall
<Boulderdash> no it doesn't
<Michael> where's godzilla when u need it?
<Yahooz> Somehow
<Boulderdash> it doesn't make sense
<Boulderdash> nothing makes sense
<Dark92Enigma> This movie only deserves a 6-MONTH BAN. THAT'S all it gets
<SirGanjalf> CriticKitten: But they look so keeeeewl...
<Vordox> Weird

<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Michael|FF7 :)
<cachi01> d3rb_: playing with sounds on a computer isnt music
<Iwa> MaxTheBrony: From first glance, I would focus some more on drawing the viewer in on the picture...maybe create some more contrast by adding lines, not only shading :)
<Prince_Lightstar> that never ends
<Buytoast> well at least it's not dubstep
<Prince_Lightstar> o wait
<d3rb_> cachi01, actually it is
<Vivix> Hehehe

<Prince_Lightstar> its make me cry :'(
<cachi01> flutterchu: slowpoke
<Vivix> I heard the intro of gangnam style
<scout19_tf2> fuq ma server crashed
<Vivix> then I closed the browser-
<cachi01> Vivix: :D
<d3rb_> wakwak do do YEAH!
<Bronysith> Gangnam style is definetely the best song of 2012
<Buytoast> O-O-O-O-OVERHYPED SONG STYLE
<Buytoast> goddamn
<Iwa> MaxTheBrony: But yes, on other notes: I do like your drawing style, I wouldn't change that :3
<Vivix> I kinda hate humour music-
<cachi01> Bronysith: not sure if troll
<Vivix> and I just really--did not like anything about the little of Gangnam I heard
<MaxTheBrony> Iwa: Thank you :3
<d3rb_> i like ganghan style since its pissing off so many people
<Vivix> well hate is too strong, I'm not a fan of humour in music
<cachi01> d3rb_: gangnam
<MaxTheBrony> Not even Rap?
<Vivix> Well, I like beastie boys
<d3rb_> meh, close enough
<MaxTheBrony> You heard Dan bull Vivix :)?
<Vivix> Noo- what's that?
<Buytoast> rap can be good sometimes
<Buytoast> like that one guy in the subway
<Vivix> oh..
<MaxTheBrony> Hes a pretty smart rapper rapping about games and poletics
<Vivix> game music?
<Buytoast> he raps pretty nicely
<MaxTheBrony> Both
<Bronysith> rap sucks
<MaxTheBrony> I hate normal rap :p
<MaxTheBrony> love nerdcore tho
<MLP_Brovakiin> MaxTheBrony: I love dan bull! :D
<Vivix> I--barely got into pony music, only got into it because I really liked PinkiePieSwear
<HoodyNinja> Wierd al!
<cachi01> only tolerable rap is humour and parody rap
<Vivix> game-rapping? I'll check it out, but probably wont like it
<HoodyNinja> Ello bstate
<MaxTheBrony> MLP_Brovakiin: Hes awesome :D
<cachi01> hi HoodyNinja :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> MaxTheBrony: I love his dishonoured rap :)
<ekips> We really shouldn't discuss about what is good music. Nobody can win in that discussion
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai HoodyNinja :)
<d3rb_> taste is subjective to the listener, there is no better genre, just like there is no best pony.
<Buytoast> ha, pony music. you mean sound clips played over and over again for 4 minutes
<MaxTheBrony> MLP_Brovakiin: Yah its epic
<MaxTheBrony> Heya HoodyNinja :)
<Vivix> Well discussing what we like in music is fun
<d3rb_> ekips, spot on mate
<Vivix> discussing what is superior is silly, but can still be fun
<Buytoast> well, the best horse is the yelow one so you're wrong there
<Vivix> Buytoast sadly that is a lot of it
<MaxTheBrony> ekips: That is true :)

<DerpyMuffins> So much daw Bronysith
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix: Aight :D
<Vivix> but if you want to hear what I like in rap, check out Beastie Boys - Gratitude
<HoodyNinja> Not the glaze! ;~;

<d3rb_> beastie boys, hell yeah Vivix
<Vivix> even if he more sings in that song- ah well

<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Vordox> HOW DOES IT FEEL BEING ON THE RECIEVING SIDE PSY!
<Spell-of-Gaming> This is much better than the original Gangnam Style
<Vordox> Slamjam > Gangam style when it comes to "Slammify"
<Bronysith> HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY SEXY LADY
<hen3ry> I think I prefer the original Korean.
<d3rb_> Vordox, your very passionate about slamjam
<Vordox> d3rb_: I prefer Slam then Style song
<Bronysith> d3rb_: *you're
<Vordox> than*
<Bronysith> seriously, gangnam style is too damn awesome
<Spell-of-Gaming> The original Gangnam Style became too annoying as hell
<Vordox> Bronysith: Nah, it's just been overexpoed
<Vordox> exposed*
<Vordox> There's MILLIONS of better songs
<Vordox> But they don't get exposed.
<cachi01> mute button wasnt working so i had to close browser :I
<hipster_sprinkle> i hated gangnam before it was cool
<AJIsAwesome> hipster_sprinkle: :D
<Vordox> That's why you dig your own song and find songs NOONE heard that deservest to be heard.
<Bronysith> Vordox: thats internet for you
<ekips> making good song != becoming famous
<Vordox> ekips: Sad truth :(
<hipster_sprinkle> ekips: dat programming notation

<Kencolt> Vordox: THe exposing wasn't because of the song itself-- it was because they made a very quirky video to go with it. Otherwise, it would have quietly sank into obscurity, really.

<otakon> lol
<otakon> these guys are nuts
<Rainboom> xD
<otakon> "Take off eh?"
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge: thats good. I think she neads more recognition for starting MLP.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AttackWithHugs> Bronysith, did you see that pic I linked from r/WTF?
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: Indeed :)
<Bronysith> AttackWithHugs: link in SST
<MadSurge> Who are these canadian guys talking?
<Kimori> hmm, interesting name
*Rainboom hugs imaginary Twilight Sparkle and Dashie plushies
<magmablock> Minecraft sure has evolved over the years
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge: Ive read hat she originally wanted MLP to appeal to both boys and Girls, but then people in charge decided to focus on just girls.
<Rainboom> magmablock: Eeyup
<Kimori> Stormy I thought that wouldive been a unisex name
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: and then, after twenty years...
<magmablock> http://www.zootpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/test8.jpg
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge: More like 30 years later
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: better late than never anyway
<Rainboom> I remember the first episodes I watched b4 getting into MLP which were A Dog and a Pony Show, an On Demand preview of Dragonshy, and look before you sleep
<CriticKitten> SO MANY LEMONS
<Rainboom> dem lemons
<CriticKitten> Can you eat all those lemons?
<Shizuka> 13not lemons

<Rainboom> never but Pinkie could
<CriticKitten> I know. Referring to that one video. XD
<Yokupony> These guys are deep, man
<Rainboom> they do look like lemons tho xD
<CriticKitten> It is sort of fun to imagine them as lemons
<Rex_Mundi> So yaeh, Brohoof to Bonnie Zacherle:)
<CriticKitten> Then that would mean Shizu is making lemon bars :D
<Rainboom> next week next week next week next week

<J_E_Smith71> cachi01: On EverFree Radio
<Spell-of-Gaming> [INSERT SOME COLT HERE]
<DerpDash> Hey Everypony!! :)
<cachi01> J_E_Smith71: yay brb
<Lunar_Brony> hi DerpDash
<Deacon> there are colts? I thought this was a mare's show
<Rainboom> Spell-of-Gaming: dat colt in the background
<Deacon> lali-ho DerpDash
<DerpDash> So...who's streaming?
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka
<MadSurge> DerpDash: Shizu is :3
<HoodyNinja> DerpDash!
<Deacon> well if you can't tell by the bug, it's shizu
<DerpDash> Oh >.<
<Rainboom> I was on ebay today and I got Twilight Pinkie and Rainbow Dash plushies all in one x3
<Kimori> Some websites can do that
*DerpDash is oblivious to shizu tag in the corner
<HoodyNinja> K, imma head out no, bbl
<HoodyNinja> latas
<Deacon> must've costed you alot Rainboom
<MadSurge> Rainboom: ENVYYYY
<Rainboom> Deacon: Yeah
<Deacon> laters hoo-- oh
<Kimori> Only downside is that they show a ton of ads
<Rainboom> Getting pony plushes on ebay is hard <_>
<Shizuka> 13this is mostly just a proof of concept
<Shizuka> 13going to need to find a buildcraft solution that doesn't overflow pipes
<Deacon> msut be, seeing as the average plush is around $50-100
<AJIsAwesome> I don't want to go, sprinkles. ;~;
<Shizuka> 13since redpower isn't out yer
<Lunar_Brony> Rainboom nice! I can't find an RD plushie that I like. If her eyes don't look right to me I won't buy it. Unfortunately, even if I do find a high-quality plush, it's either extremely expensive or not for sale.
<Rainboom> Deacon: I saw a perfect AJ plush for like 400$
<Shizuka> 13awful efficient though
<Rainboom> I got the Twilight Pinkie and Dashie ones combined for like 60$ though
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka it looks pretty cool either way . . . what does it do exactly? I'm popping in and out of BS.
<Deacon> oh, neat
<Rainboom> they werent the best but hey at least it was ok
<Derpy_Hooves> is there going to be a PPPS today?
<Shizuka> 13for every ore that goes in the left chest
<Shizuka> 13it enters a macerator that produces two dust from the ore
<Shizuka> 13then into a furnace that smelts one ingot per dust
<Shizuka> 13so instead of ore > furnace > ingot, i get ore > macerator > furnace > 2x ingot
<Afflict> ah
<Lunar_Brony> nice
<Rainboom> IM PRINCESS CELESTIA COME FLY WITH ME =D
<Deacon> PPPS?
<Lunar_Brony> and then everything gets deposited in the end chest
<Deacon> oh the podcasdy
<Deacon> dunno
<otakon> oops
<Shizuka> 13only problem is the macerator can only really process one stack, the furnace can process two
<otakon> sorry bout that, accidentally closed this tab
<Rainboom> lol
<Shizuka> 13if the pipes try to push more in, it overflows and they pop out
<Mutterguy|SLP> Shizuka I need to start playing with pipe so I can do that automatically
<otakon> Shizuka: you're a real minecraft-aholic aren't you?
<Shizuka> 13need to find a way to fix that, not sure how with just buildcraft
<Shizuka> 13redpower's pipes let the items bounce back and forth until they find somewhere to land
<Shizuka> 13but redpower isn't ready yet
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> make their travel longer ?
<Kurra> o.o;;
<Rainboom> Fillies I want to hug for life besides the CMC: Pipsqueak Twist and Rumble :)
<Lunar_Brony> I'm guessing you can't split the pipes into 2 paths
<Shizuka> 13well you can, so i could wire up more furnaces
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/OhyOe.gif
<Shizuka> 13but would be more efficient to not pull the ore until it's needed
<Shizuka> 13not sure if that can be done with buildcraft alone
<Shizuka> 13have to read up more
<Rainboom> Bronysith: Poor Giraffe :c
<therainbowvortex> hey every pony guess who
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/swPpI.jpg
<Rainboom> chicken poo?
<AdamTheDuck> Hello therainbowvortex
<boodfire> you can pipe out the overflowing ones from the bottom of the macerator and loop it back until theres room
<Deacon> lali-ho therainbowvortex
<therainbowvortex> hey AdamTheDuck
<Shizuka> 13anyhoof
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, .-. nice image
<Rainboom> Haii TheRainbowvortex
<Shizuka> 13oh is that the trick
<DerpyMuffins> So much lol Bronysith
<Shizuka> 13would still rather it not try to pull from the chest until the macerator needs ore
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/aIiKp
<Rainboom> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/#f/8373/
<Panda-> So much pink text ^^

<Franek12354> Where are the admins, where they are needed? Spell-of-Gaming. I agree
<RDash5000> what is up everybody?!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, RDash5000. :)

<Domo> MadSurge: yep owo
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: sorry for wasting ur time..
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: I am too. :)
<DashWithRainbows> You guys need to realize that mods lurk this chat.
<Eli> MadSurge: would that be a problem?
<Kimori> Did you think of a name yet Stormy?
<MadSurge> Domo and AJIsAwesome: AWESOME!
<Kimori> btw Afflict if your going to use that name from now on, youl have to put your password in
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> DashWithRainbows they don't know the meaning of Lurk Moar
<MadSurge> Eli: not for me
<Eli> MadSurge: that's a no then :)
<Kimori> if you want to keep your voice
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Personally now i see why it's a classic, but the trick was to pay extra atttention to the dialogue, since it's of vital importance to the plot. Even if sometimes it seems more dialogue-driven at times, it deserves a 7/10
<Spell-of-Gaming> http://imgur.com/gallery/WBc2a
<RDash5000> forward unto dawn episode 5 was awesome
<Kimori> unless you still planned on using Cades

<Kimori> It will probably take a few days til everyone here knows who you are
<Eli> Rainboom: so what i would prefer as a pet? or what's your question?
<Stormy> I'm working on the name thing now
<Rainboom> Eli: which one would you pick to be your pet

<twilight_sprinkle> well that was an interesting panel
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> some hardcore trolling was had
<Bronysith> teehee
<twilight_sprinkle> its funny how everyone was fine with it, but got huge butthurt after he made fun of fluttershy
<Bronysith> Gangnam style can make anything better
<MusicMikeTheMic> Bronysith: lol yeah
<Rainboom> http://hometowncolumbia.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/lol-cats-dont-look-behind-cat.jpg Slendy is here but he just wants 20 bucks D:

<Spell-of-Gaming> Gangnam Style can make orchestras better?
<WallDives> evening, all.
<Spell-of-Gaming> LOLNO
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, WallDives. :)

<cachi01> http://www.mememaker.net/static/images/memes/939740.jpg
<Lunar_Brony> I don't know, but it's hilarious!
<AJIsAwesome> I found Gangnam "okay" the first 2 times. After that, it just got very annoying to me.
<cachi01> ^
*twilight_sprinkle throws Dark92Enigma into hell
<WallDives> I havent seen it...nor do I want too.
<WallDives> to^
<RDash5000> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuDJORBqazI&feature=BFa&list=FL4H8Vg30mN_BaGU-7zbh6Yg
<AJIsAwesome> WallDives: Don't bother. You're not really missing out on anything. But you're welcome to. :)
<Lunar_Brony> One can never hate Gangnam Style until your school plays it over the announcement system as the daily morning music.
<Rainboom> What Would You Do If: You're in the woods and Pinkamena pops up. She smiles and asks you to come see her new basement, you accept. When you see the basement, everything is fine, but then she asks you to go in a shed. Accept or decline?
<Stormy> You scared everyone Lambda, way to go
<donutpop365> Lunar_Brony: Augh.
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: i hated it from the moment i heard it and looked at the like bar
<RDash5000> Lunar_Brony: wow. really?
<Bronysith> http://th02.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/006/2/4/arcane_luna_by_sierraex-d4lk3cs.png
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Wow. THat SUCKS. :D
<WallDives> I'd shoot her because she's a pony that talks. Reality ensues.
<cachi01> Rainboom: accept
<cachi01> Lunar_Brony: WTF
<Lunar_Brony> ^my reaction
<RDash5000> smile smile smile!!!!
<[Alpha]> Wow today has been majorly distracting for me. Watching Dan vs. Then watched the original intro to MLP, then the Italian version of my little pony intro etc
<Lunar_Brony> It also seemed that half the school was dancing to it. However, I am both dissapointed and pissed because they played "Thriller" last Monday and nobody danced.
<XxNightHawk64xX> RDash5000: i had a major depression this whole month and i decided to listen to that song..... now i love life
<JRP2234> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<cachi01> vuela y ve my little pony y muchas amigas podras encontrar
<RDash5000> XxNightHawk64xX: same here bro /)
<WallDives> english, pls
<Rainboom> I remember the good times on Saturdays when new episodes of MLP were on the bronystate screen and we watch Aquabats before it :D
<cachi01> WallDives: espaÃ±ol prfs
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: everyone dances to gangnam because its easy, same reason people like it, its an elemntary tune
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle yeah, and Thriller is easier.
<RDash5000> i became a brony after they finished season 2 :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: yeah but most dont remember thriller

<Derpy_Hooves> i didn't know egorapter was at eqla
<cachi01> [Alpha] pls
<AJIsAwesome> Not all dubstep is bad, IMO. It's just that most dubstep doesn't utilize the instruments used in dubstep well.
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah i just watched that panel Derpy_Hooves
<RDash5000> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us_rY141vic&feature=BFa&list=FL4H8Vg30mN_BaGU-7zbh6Yg the epicness

<WallDives> cachi01, now you arent even trying!
<Rainboom> I remember in school when my principal dressed up as this afro roller skater guy o_o
<cachi01> WallDives: lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Derpy_Hooves: max kept trolling everyone, at first people were fine, but tremendous butthurt erupted when he said fluttershy is a pussy bitch
<Rainboom> Oh god

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02J_E_Smith71: Yeah
<AttackWithHugs> NewSuperBronyU, what's going on now?
<Kimori> Your giving me a flashback of this youtube video now that I saw years ago
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02AttackWithHugs: A dance party
<Kimori> LOL
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But I'm so upset now...
<Lemon> :D
<Buytoast> I hope Jon "Tons of Dumb" Tron wasn't there too
<cachi01> NewSuperBronyU: why?
<Rainboom> #Vinyl_Scratch
<J_E_Smith71> So ends the first day of EQLA, and all that's left is the dance party
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I had the reaction video recorded of the SWAG.MOV trailer...
<AttackWithHugs> NewSuperBronyU, I'm watching the stream and I don't see a dance party
<J_E_Smith71> Uh oh
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02And the first 15 minutes
<J_E_Smith71> Uh oh
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I deleted it by accident
<Lemon> Found my new name
<cachi01> NewSuperBronyU: and what happened......
<AttackWithHugs> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<cachi01> damn
<J_E_Smith71> .....
<Lunar_Brony> -_(\
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So

<Spell-of-Gaming> I give no fucks about SWAG.Mov

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Kind of sad now :(
<cachi01> FIRST 15 MINUTES?
<cachi01> HOWLONG IS IT?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But Max and Egoraptor almost got kicked off stage
<d3rb> :D
<AttackWithHugs> Why?
<cachi01> NewSuperBronyU: xDDD why?
<Lunar_Brony> I don't watch the .mov videos . . . why do I care?
<Lunar_Brony> I care!
<weeping_pegasi82> looking for somethin to do~
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They were so vulgar and rude that it seemed like the staff were at a scramble to fix it
<Lemon> :o
<Shizuka> 13what a shock
<Spell-of-Gaming> Eh, their fault
<Buytoast> ha
<Spell-of-Gaming> Not really suprising
<cachi01> NewSuperBronyU: oh yeah i heard max insulted fluttershy
<WallDives> not a surprise.
<cachi01> lol
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Calling people homosexual, gay, swearing a lot, etc.
<Shizuka> 13again what a shock
<WallDives> " "
<Shizuka> 13when you're plugging the .mov series
<Buytoast> there's something i'd like to see
<Bronysith> goddamnit Equestria daily i do not want to see an 8 minute preview of a 1 hour show
<therainbowvortex> night every pony even thouge its only 4;pm over here im tired
<Shizuka> 13you have to lower your standards to subkindergarten
<DaringDerpy> hey there :)
<cachi01> oh no. im unexplicably inflating again
<kjakings> It's not registered

<DaringDerpy> good night therainbowvortex
<blachi01> night therainbowvortex
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02night therainbowvortex :)
<J_E_Smith71> flutterchu: First two minutes were shown at the EQLA panel
<RedDragonX> Wut
<RedDragonX> This isn't either?
<AttackWithHugs> Night therainbowvortex
<Lemon> Pretty sure kjakings was registered
<DaringDerpy> the .mov productions are of questionable intellectual quality, no doubt...
<Lemon> :o
<weeping_pegasi82> flutterchu: you said you had a youtube account what's the name?
<DaringDerpy> but....acceptance, shizuka?
<flutterchu> weeping_pegasi82: BuildermanVSNotch.......why do you ask?
<DaringDerpy> don't even know what you are talking about
<Rainboom> Shhhhh! its my favorite part on the Buffer show! :O
<J_E_Smith71> Uh NewSuperBronyU you better mention your Twitter you erased the footage then
<Spell-of-Gaming> I question the .MOV videos' intelligence
<weeping_pegasi82> flutterchu: forgot to ask earlier my mind is weird :P
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Got an error tweeting it
<aristeo> This one is registered
<Shizuka> 13the .mov series is why this fandom will ultimately collapse
<pony_3546> hello
<Guest29796> :D
<blachi01> Shizuka: nah
<Lunar_Brony> hi pony_3546
<DaringDerpy> I blame the Jews
<Spell-of-Gaming> Shizuka: And why people hate us
<Shizuka> 13can't be happy with the subject matter, have to make it horrible
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-3qncy5Qfk&feature=fvwrel
<blachi01> i blame dinkleberg
<pony_3546> will this site stream the new pony episodes?
<prince-Dari> I'm gonna keep this one
<Shizuka> 13no we never stream ponies here ever
<blachi01> pony_3546: yes
<Kimori> that link has strong language btw
<Spell-of-Gaming> pony_3546: Yes. :)
<pony_3546> swesome
<J_E_Smith71> NewSuperBronyU: Only 13 tweets and they already have you at the limit?
<Kimori> but i thought it was hilarous
<Shizuka> 13oh also, daylight savings ends tonight in the us
<DerpyMuffins> Ask Tom pony_3546
<Rainboom> pony_3546: You new here? :$
<pony_3546> then i can add th RD theather in my auto pony program that im writing :3
<Shizuka> 13so get that extra hour of sleep tonight
<flutterchu> weeping_pegasi82: why did you ask in the first place.....subscribe?
<pony_3546> yes im new here
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka ugh, tell me about it. I nearly had a heartattack when my sister clicked on "Shed.mov". She's 6.
<pony_3546> looking for streaming sites
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Was able to send the message
<Rainboom> Welcome to the herd pony_3546
<pony_3546> thx!
<Rainboom> np :)
<blachi01> Lunar_Brony: why did she clicked on it lol
<AttackWithHugs> Welcome to the herd pony_3546
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But yeah, it was a family-friendly convention and having Egoraptor yell 'WELL FUCK YOU' at the top of his lungs didn't go well with Staff >>
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: idk, i always saw the .mov series and its popularity as a sign that the fandom is able to laugh at itself which is good
<DerpyMuffins> Not everyone here a brony
<DaringDerpy> hey pony_3546
<J_E_Smith71> Then again I had errors too
<AttackWithHugs> pony_3546, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
<pony_3546> hey
<Shizuka> 13that's not fandom laughing at itself
<weeping_pegasi82> flutterchu: sure why not
<Shizuka> 13it's fandom taking itself for granted
<Shizuka> 13and turning into 4chan
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSuperBronyU: lawl egoraptor did that? i didnt notice that, i just remember max's hardcore trolling
<Rainboom> Fluttershy episodes r the best no exceptions
<Spell-of-Gaming> While I love a good Game Grumps at times, Egoraptor needs to tone down
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02twilight_sprinkle: They were both doing it.
<DaringDerpy> the fandom originates from 4chan
<pony_3546> thx Attackwithhugs :3
<flutterchu> Welcome to Bronystate pony_3546...the place where you watch movies, ponies and Music you will face ups and down and cheering and killing and PM's and Me
<Kandarihu|GreenHair> Oh that Egoraptor
<AttackWithHugs> pony_3546, you're welcome :3
<Shizuka> 13DaringDerpy: that it does, it also left 4chan to become better
<DaringDerpy> you have more /b/tards here than you want to know
<pony_3546> :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> The fandom DID originate from 4chan, actually
<pony_3546> like this place already
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: idk, depends on how you look at it
<DaringDerpy> it left 4chan because pony wars
<J_E_Smith71> NewSuperBronyU: twilight_sprinkle mentioned they were nearly kicked off because Max called Fluttershy something rather vulgar
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Honestly, I was shocked that people were just taking it. They were doing it pretty bad that the girl who stood up for herself was probably the better part of it...which MY PHONE RAN OUT OF SPACE WHILE RECORDING IT
<blachi01> i dont give a shit. as long as they keep doing movs and egoraptor keeps doing game grumps and animations im fine
<Spell-of-Gaming> And then they made /mlp/
<Rainboom> We really need a Fluttershy emote icon doing the yay pose c:
<Lunar_Brony> blachi01 she watches ponies on YouTube mainly because I showed her she chould (we don't get the Hub). She was browsing videos and I was walking by the office when she clicked on it.
<twilight_sprinkle> J_E_Smith71: i didnt know they were almost kicked off, i only saw the fluttershy bit, didnt know about them getting in trouble
<pony_3546> im going for sure add this site to my program :3
<Kandarihu|GreenHair> Well the fandom was driven from 4chan, though.
<blachi01> Lunar_Brony: dayum lol
<weeping_pegasi82> NewSuperBronyU: you used your phone?
<pony_3546> it was?
<flutterchu> who's Max?
<Afflict> dafuq did i just watch?
<Kandarihu|GreenHair> And only the most depraved parts of the fandom returned to /mlp/
<Shizuka> 13but hey, if we're okay with crap like .mov becoming the norm, i'll revise my prediction of the fandom's collapse to be sooner rather than later
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSuperBronyU: well now you have con experience :P
<Kimori> I know, isnt it crazy?
<blachi01> flutterchu: max gilardi
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But yeah, they were insulting everyone pretty bad, that it was funny, but when you realize it, they just got away with telling off the fandom and giving the middle finger to every brony there.
<blachi01> flutterchu: hotdiggedydemon
<DaringDerpy> I don't know what you expect, Shizuka. Apllying your own values, expecting your own values, can only fail. The fandom is richer than that
<Lunar_Brony> blachi01 you think it's funny? I don't watch the .mov series and I knew the dangers. She is 6 years old!
<Saturn> 08,01want to know something cool?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02And they were pretty serious about it
<flutterchu> oh...um......okay
<Rainboom> pony_3546: You can change your name by clicking Refresh on the bottom of the chat and then type in your nickname :3
<Lunar_Brony> hi Saturn. Shoot
<pony_3546> okay :3
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: ice
<blachi01> Lunar_Brony: .......lol
<Saturn> 08,01ubuntu pc sales last year were greater than apple's computer sales in 2007
<blachi01> Saturn: yay
<bbuubbi> yo im back :3
<Rainboom> :3
<Afflict> yeah haha
<weeping_pegasi82> bbuubbi: nice name :D
<Guest29796> o.o
<Rainboom> xD
<bbuubbi> thats my name evrywhere :3
<cachi01> bubi XDD
<Lunar_Brony> that is kinda cool, and keep in mind that I have no care towards Linux
<cachi01> bbuubbi: cool name :3
<DaringDerpy> even here in this chatroom we have regulars who are cynical beyond good and evil and give the middle finger to everyone every day
<bbuubbi> straight from my childhood mind xD
<Lunar_Brony> but I do loathe Apple technology with a vengeance..
<DaringDerpy> they are part of the fandom
<alexxm> did i miss something
<Rainboom> Its like you typed it on a public bus and it kept bumping
<cachi01> -7me gives the middle finger to DaringDerpy
<twilight_sprinkle> >-7
<twilight_sprinkle> cashie pls
<bbuubbi> -/me fil?
<twilight_sprinkle> >fil
<bbuubbi> -/me fail?
<cachi01> ITS A NEW COMMAND OK?
<cachi01> WAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Shizuka> 13DaringDerpy: and again, if that's going to be normal, the fandom will collapse
<Lunar_Brony> >fail fail
*bbuubbi is testing
<Lunar_Brony> xD
<Guest29796> Oh no!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> :D
<Shizuka> 13being a dick to everyone doesn't tend to foster community
<Lunar_Brony> The fail has been doubled!
<bbuubbi> hey i can :D
<weeping_pegasi82> I don't see the appeal of Apple stuff, it crashes often it hates my games and it won't die!!
<flutterchu> im glad BFDIA 4 came out...does anyone want to see?
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E174ogB49xs&list=UUeKLuqGciqZZ5RFYk5CbqXg&index=1&feature=plcp
*Rainboom Rainboom
*bbuubbi is wondering how many commands exists
<bbuubbi> :o
*Rainboom likes this
<DaringDerpy> if you can't look past these few people, if you define the whole fandom by these you have conflicts with, then it can only fail for you, Shizuka
*bbuubbi is going to abuse this command
<DaringDerpy> not for the rest of us
*Rainboom is being a faggot by saying everything in the third person
<Shizuka> 13DaringDerpy: these few people are the public face of the fandom
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: well theres a point where its too much yes, but sometimes its just joking around. indeed it doesnt foster the community, but its always important to give benefit of the dounbt
<Lunar_Brony> not many are eligible if you aren't a mod or aren't in a specific chatroom
*Rainboom thinks bbuubbi's plan is a great idea
*cachi01 liek le trixie command
<J_E_Smith71> And the .MOVs wrap up at the end of the year anyway. Maybe it'll die off when they've stopped making them
<DerpyMuffins> DaringDerpy it be wise not to argue with a mod
<DaringDerpy> Shizuka: giving in to public pressure? we didn't get strong by being cowards
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: because most people understand they were just joking, they arent idiots, they wouldnt legitimately go out and do that
<flutterchu> SWAG.MOV VS SEASON 3
*bbuubbi agrees with Rainboom
*Rainboom nods
<Shizuka> 13so you assume
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: and if its a joke, then it shouldnt be taken seriously
*Rainboom breathes
<Shizuka> 13see
<Shizuka> 13i could say
<Shizuka> 13HEY YOU
<Shizuka> 13FUCK YOU
<Ponies47> Yeah Daylight Savings time! Another hour to waste my life of computer tonight! :D
*bbuubbi sits down
<Shizuka> 13and go
<twilight_sprinkle> ;_;
<cachi01> XD
<Shizuka> 13oh hey it's a joke
<twilight_sprinkle> I HAT YOU
<Rainboom> LOL
<flutterchu> :'(
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, yay \:3/
<Shizuka> 13doesn't change the fact that i insulted you
<twilight_sprinkle> ;A;
<DerpyMuffins> Good example Shizuka
<Afflict> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQtKnDGhxmk seriously, what the fuck is this?
<DaringDerpy> the fandom will stand and fall with the quality of the episodes...everything else...secondary
<bbuubbi> flame wars just hapened?
<Shizuka> 13and it doesn't make it retroactively okay
<Rainboom> I have a pikachu hat
<cachi01> Shizuka: to be honest that was hilarious
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: but you didnt
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47, I like DST in the fall.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: i dont consider it an insult
<flutterchu> Rainboom: oh yeah...well i AM part pikachu
<J_E_Smith71> Hey NewSuperBronyU on the Twitter it says you erased the SWAG bit to record more of the panel, so did you get another portion of it?
<Rainboom> flutterchu: AWESOME :O
<Buytoast> what's going on here? did someone have a DARN DIRTY OPINION again?
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: AVGN would say that
<bbuubbi> hey guys
<Buytoast> you know those are forbidden here
<Rainboom> Hai bbuubbi
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02J_E_Smith71: I got more of the panel, yes.
<bbuubbi> any one else watching superbrony64's livestream?
<bbuubbi> yes`?
<Rainboom> bbuubbi: Ping!
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: ONLY IN CHARACTER THOUGH*
<DaringDerpy> ok...you don't want a reasonable approach...I'm ok with it...
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: the intentions are whats important,if he didnt mean to insult us, and i believe he didnt because he would have to be mental to go out and do it in public, why would i consider it an insult if i know he didnt mean it
<Lunar_Brony> If you really think about it, swearing should be redundant. It's just words; your tone of voice says more about your message than the message itself.
<bbuubbi> ping sound is ping
*stormy sees the title
<Rainboom> dat ping
<Ponies47> NewSuperBronyU: Did you get to meet HotDiggetyDemon? Like talk to him? O.O
<Shizuka> 13and if he did mean to insult us?
<bbuubbi> howd u do that?
<DaringDerpy> but...don't play the moral watchdog then...
<CriticKitten> DaringDerpy: I resent being called cynical beyond good and evil. I am a perfectly healthy level of cynicism, exactly the dosage doctors prescribe in fact.
<Lunar_Brony> how you say it is more important than what you say
<Shizuka> 13and got away with it because he's internet famous?
<WallDives> twilight_sprinkle, remember murder without the intention is still murder.
<flutterchu> AVGN: "whoever made this is a C:DK Sucker, Desciption: sucks c:Dk
<WallDives> (ok, manslaughter, close enough)
*stormy closes out of it
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Ponies47: No, but I met him to draw me a sketch of my OC
<Rainboom> bbuubbi: Best command is this one:
<Rainboom> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 6 days, 11 hours, 45 minutes, 49 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<bbuubbi> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 6 days, 11 hours, 45 minutes, 45 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, http://i.imgur.com/ResZP.jpg best sketch ever.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I remember some brony getting shielded by other bronies because he did something wrong, I think
<Rainboom> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: thats not why i assume hes not lying, if anything, people who would genuinely insult others wouldnt say it out loud, they would think it. famous or not, no sane person would say it at a con
*AdamTheDuck bites Jmo
<twilight_sprinkle> WallDives: thats completely different
<Rainboom> Tom forgot about Part 2! :O
<DaringDerpy> oh...now it gets interesting...
<Jmo> Oi, no biting.
<twilight_sprinkle> WallDives: if you were murdered, you dont have a say in the matter
<bbuubbi> hey guys, any coding geniuses in here?
<twilight_sprinkle> WallDives: but you Can choose whether to be sensitive or not
<Ponies47> NewSuperBronyU: I talked to him and he drew me a pwetty picture (Which should never be shown in this chat becasue it pissed everyone off (You can see it on my Twitter :3))
<bbuubbi> i fucked up badly in my code >.>
<CriticKitten> What prompted this discussion anyways?
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 replace the Cheetos with a can of Coke and the Triforce with a maple leaf and you got me in a nutshell.
<cachi01> AVGN: ''It fuckin' sucks, it suckin' fucks, it fuckin' blows, it's a piece of shit, and I don't like it''
<twilight_sprinkle> bbuubbi: phase4 and Saturn
<WallDives> he still did it. you cant control peoples reactions. that was my point.
<Ponies47> NewSuperBronyU: HA! I love the drawing he did of your OC XD
<WallDives> very pooly made, I admit.
<flutterchu> does anyone want to see the most realistic drawing ever
<bbuubbi> what?
<WallDives> poorly^
<bbuubbi> the?
<Rainboom> yes?
<flutterchu> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xsZiwTdIfas/T3Cp0y2LL8I/AAAAAAAAKWo/_ARW0cT21uA/s1600/Most_Realistic_Drawing_Ever.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> WallDives: indeed, they shouldnt have done it, and i agree it will cause problems for the fandom, but its also the peoples' fault if they took it too seriously
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But yeah, I'm sure the EQLA staff are furious about what happened.
<cachi01> flutterchu: wow
<twilight_sprinkle> and for the record, i dont even like egoraptor
<bbuubbi> wow
<bbuubbi> is that a DRWAING?!
<Shizuka> 13see, you can say that in hindsight
<Rainboom> flutterchu: thats a drawing??? holy shit man o_o
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: XD
<Shizuka> 13WOW IT WAS SO OBVIOUS HE WAS JOKING
<DaringDerpy> what exactly happened?
<cachi01> NewSuperBronyU: get into MGS mode and spy the staff rage :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: it was kinda obvious from the start though
*CriticKitten asks again: What exactly prompted this discussion? O.o
<DerpyMuffins> Great another debate
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I took a picture of staff in the background talking about it
<Lunar_Brony> did they look pissed?
<Shizuka> 13and in hindsigh you can say gee anyone who couldn't immediately tell he was joking is taking everything too seriously, because that's somehow bad
<Rainboom> VOTE: Obama VS Romney!
<DerpyMuffins> Alright everyone place your bets
<cachi01> VS wins
<cachi01> VS for president
<Spell-of-Gaming> I really hope that the EQLA convention won't be the same as the Everfree convention
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: taking things too seriously is often bad
<bbuubbi> ^^this
<Rainboom> YAY
<DerpyMuffins> Shizuka or twilight_sprinkle
<Rainboom> Go VS!
<Shizuka> 13and why is that
<CriticKitten> Rainboom: I want to mash both over the head with a hammer. That's my vote.
<DerpyMuffins> Place your bets
<flutterchu> Trotbama vs clopny...hmmmmmm.........ROMNEH
<weeping_pegasi82> no polotics!!
<Shizuka> 13why is taking something seriously bad
<bbuubbi> lols
<cachi01> or
<weeping_pegasi82> but whatever
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka you can say anything in hindsight, but it almost never makes a difference.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: because you could end up doing something you shouldnt have because you assumed someone meant to hurt you
<Buytoast> I don't know what's going on, but i'm guessing it's because someone has an opinion
<Rainboom> PEDObama VS Clopney :D
<bbuubbi> i should be sleeping right now D:
<cachi01> or wins
<Shizuka> 13and when you're wrong?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Problem is, he knew no-one would take anything seriously, so he pretty much did whatever he wanted
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssRh39r3J20&feature=plcp
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: wrong about what
<weeping_pegasi82> bbuubbi: what is this sleep that you speak of?
<J_E_Smith71> Inb4 Max is banned from future cons
<bbuubbi> its a state of relaxsation
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02He even got everyone to salute like a Nazi and shout 'SIEG HEIL' during the comedy pledge.
<DaringDerpy> so we have brony fandom factions now? politics? meh...
<bbuubbi> cuite refreshing if you ask me :3
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSuperBronyU: he Did go overboard, i agree, but at the same time people just shouldnt feel to bad about it
<flutterchu> SHOYT UP AND LISTEN TO AUTOTUNE PRESIDENTS
<cachi01> NewSuperBronyU: oh god what xd
<Rainboom> Slendy's gonna get ya if you sleep ;O
<bbuubbi> well
<weeping_pegasi82> bbuubbi: eh never heard of it
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU i finished it
<Ponies47> NewSuperBronyU: But Max was a jerk to us at Canterlot Gardens as well. He wasen't kicked off the stage. He said some pretty mean stuff to us. We weren't upset we were laughing (Even I was).
<twilight_sprinkle> one sec
<cachi01> slendy only attacks when you are awake
<SpeccyRush> I vote for calm
<cachi01> he is no coward
<bbuubbi> i dident plan on it eathier so whatever...
<Vordox> Whose this max?
<alexxm> night guys
<Vordox> Hotdiggety?
<cachi01> Vordox: yes
<Lunar_Brony> g'night alexxm
<Shizuka> 13i love that being a jackass is so accepted in society these days
<weeping_pegasi82> I vote for PONIES
<J_E_Smith71> Vordox: Yep
<Vordox> Oh screw him. =P
<Rainboom> Stupid dog you make me look bad! BOOGABOOGABOOGA
<DerpyMuffins> Shizuka has a point
<Shizuka> 13i for one welcome the implosion of civilization
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: if you jsut meant what if im wrong about everything, well thats a possilbility with anything
<Jmo> lololol
<CriticKitten> I'm still clueless on what is going on. ;_;
<bbuubbi> so u meen that if i fall asleep, im safe from slendy, or the exact oposite?
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Except for the nice part of civilization that's still decent
<twilight_sprinkle> anyway bbuubbi if youre having problems with coding ask Phase4 or Saturn
<Buytoast> the world is shit these days Shizuka, people only grow stupider
<Vordox> Let him do what he wants, he's just testing his limits with each video he makes about ponies =P
<bbuubbi> oaky
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Buytoast> it's all over
<cachi01> J_E_Smith71: that part exists?
<Vordox> Once the limit is reached...shit'll go down
<Phase4> 00,02bbuubbi, do i detect code?
<DerpyMuffins> There is your colors Phase4
<bbuubbi> yes
<Lunar_Brony> ohai Phase4
<bbuubbi> u do
<Phase4> 00,02DerpyMuffins, indeed
<bbuubbi> to be exact its C#
<DerpyMuffins> You mind clearing this debate Phase4?
<flutterchu> DUBSTEP VS AUTOTUNE
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: im not saying its a good thing and should be done, i really hate how being a prick is cool nowadays, but trolling just isnt genuine prick..iness
<Phase4> 00,02DerpyMuffins, which debate?
<cachi01> flutterchu: they both suck
<Shizuka> 13which makes it okay?
<Jmo> chavo
<DerpyMuffins> The one Shizuka is in
<Phase4> 00,02bbuubbi, bug me in pm and i'll try help
<DashWithRainbows> Yes Joomay?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: yes, because its just for fun and isnt meant as an insult, so why take it as an insult
<Kimori> yeah before I play this Afflict what is it
<Phase4> 00,02DerpyMuffins, whats the debate about?
<Shizuka> 13because it's fun for the people trolling
<Shizuka> 13it's far from fun for the people being trolled
<MadSurge> Vordox: joke's on him, as long as the Jappleack thing is done I'm only going to watch one video of him :D
<Shizuka> 13but who gives a shit about them
<Rainboom> watching presidents game
*cachi01 is eating popcorn and drinking some soda while watching the debate
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: actually again, that only depends on how sensitive youre being about it
<DerpyMuffins> Phase4 it started out with .mov
<Shizuka> 13no see
<Buytoast> bbuubbi, do what i do
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: me and my friends troll each other all the time, we understand it and its somewhat fun at times
<Shizuka> 13trolling implies that the opposite party does not enjoy it
<Buytoast> give up on coding and focus on animation
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: well there are different kinds of trolling, true
<Shizuka> 13now we get to change the definition to make sure it stays acceptable
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: there is trolling that is genuinely trying to insult, but thats not the one im talking about
<flutterchu> give up on PMRants and focus on mapmaker42
<bbuubbi> give up coding?
<WallDives> movin the goalposts and whatnot
<bbuubbi> hell no
<Phase4> 00,02imho trolling is mischief at others expense. like pranks these can be friendly and enjoyed by anyone, or unfriendly and enjoyed only by the troll
<bbuubbi> never
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: depends on how bad the prank is
<cachi01> trolls are funny. maxmoefoe is funny
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: if its a small silly one, everyone usually just laughs it off
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: your color she is back =D
<Vordox> GET HAPPY
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=212xU4lK06s
<Afflict> Basically this kid has a baby out of his hands
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: but im never happy..
<Afflict> don't bother watching it
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle depends on your defeniton of "bad"
<bbuubbi> dat
<bbuubbi> techno
<Kimori> How come it has Vagina in it?
<bbuubbi> thingy style
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, well really big elaborate pranks can also be laughed off, it depends on who's involved and what the prank is
<CriticKitten> ....welp
<Vordox> Happy Techno bbuubbi !
<Stormy> I'm about to go into a movie
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: bad what, i forgot what i said
<Spell-of-Gaming> Trolling is pretty much enjoyed by someone with a different view of the perspective
<bbuubbi> BOM BOM BOM BOM!!!! UNTS UNTS UNTS UNTS!
<Stormy> See you guys later
<Kimori> what movie?
<Vordox> bbuubbi: Fine you want more...artistic?
<CriticKitten> Kay then, back to GW2.
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: that is true, which is why im saying that people should just try to laugh it off
<Stormy> Wreck-it Ralph
<bbuubbi> nah
<bbuubbi> im fine with this
*bbuubbi headbangs

*bbuubbi hits head in table
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDEk0TVmW0w
<Shizuka> 13or are you supposed to automatically know
<Vordox> Shizuka: Major population
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: idk i usually am able to tell
<Shizuka> 13you are
<bbuubbi> :o
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, no, laugh off ones that you enjoy, quietly ignore the other trolls
<cachi01> Vordox: i cant get my hands in nier :/
<Afflict> see ya
<bbuubbi> DUBSTEP! :D
<Lunar_Brony> flash be crashin' on meh
<Phase4> 00,02if no one pays attention they'll get bored
<Vordox> cachi01: In? what?
<Stormy> All I know is out had video game characters in it
<Lunar_Brony> anyways
<Lunar_Brony> [20:23:40] <twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: if its a small silly one, everyone usually just laughs it off
<Stormy> See ya
<Lunar_Brony> wait, wrong one
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<bbuubbi> im getting ready to die of eargasm...
<Lunar_Brony> and now I lost the original message!
<cachi01> Vordox: its so hard to find
<Vordox> bbuubbi: Which video? :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: people just dont give the benefit of doubt nowadays anymore
<Vordox> cachi01: Of course, I told you. ><
<bbuubbi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw
<cachi01> Vordox: lol
<Vordox> Nier is one of those "Golden Must haves"
<Vordox> You're not getting it easy
<Rainboom> Going to bed now night everypony! :)
<bbuubbi> but now i dident die
<bbuubbi> low Q is low Q D:
<cachi01> ewwww skrillex
<Vordox> A game that BLOWS everyone mind after it got discontinued
<Shizuka> 13trust is highly difficult to earn with me
<cachi01> night Rainboom :)
<Vordox> Shizuka: You don't trust me? :(
<Vordox> bbuubbi: I know something that'll make oy ulike Skrillex...
<Kimori> I remember now, I did see a commercial about it on tv
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: but thats your choice, and its not really huge trust like trusting someone with your keys or something
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEChu3hnJhU here bbuubbi :D
<Lunar_Brony> I can't imagine why Shizu >>
<bbuubbi> the typos make me unable to understand that
<bbuubbi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnua-yXjPpc
<Shizuka> 13internet exponentially more so
<cachi01> chat needs more metal
*Lunar_Brony throws a block of iron at cachi01
<Lunar_Brony> nuff metal?
<bbuubbi> what commands are aviable?
<bbuubbi> just wondering?
<Metronome> Just got back no stream?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: you dont lose anything by assuming someone is just trolling, its actually healthier to assume its just a joke instead of getting too sad over it
<Crono_brony> Hello everypony! How are you all tonight?
<bbuubbi> good, you?
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: one word, politics
<Vordox> Shizuka: So what I do to earn your trust? :(
<cachi01> thx Lunar_Brony now i can craft this metal into a shovel!
<Shizuka> 13they're just trolling when they burn billions of dollars right?
<Crono_brony> bbuubbi: I'm doing great!
<bbuubbi> good :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: not really, more psychology. its just up to every individual how to take it, get angry and sad over it or laugh it off
<cachi01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHkNl758-YM
<Shizuka> 13again, you're supposed to automatically know someone's trolling
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: the government? well no, they cant afford that
<Vordox> As I said, trolling joke/real = General populace that either laugh or shoot the person, Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13or else you assume everything is a joke
<Shizuka> 13or everything is real
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: if you cant know, then just always assume its a troll, its still better than getting angry over it
<Vordox> cachi01: Classic. <3
<DaringDerpy> most of the time, it's simple incompetence
<cachi01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nba3Tr_GLZU&feature=related
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, do what i do, take nothing seriously until you have reason to
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<DaringDerpy> getting angry about anything is immature
<DaringDerpy> clouds the mind
<DaringDerpy> no use in it
<twilight_sprinkle> release your anger..
<Shizuka> 13it focuses energy
<Lunar_Brony> bbuubbi to a normal user, "/me *message*" to slant your text, "/nick *nickname*" to change your nick, "/join *channel*" to enter a specific channel, ":kickcount *user*" to know how many times the BerryPunch bot kicked that user, and maybe a few more. ":kickcount" only works when BerryPunch is active
<Lunar_Brony> which she is!
<Crono_brony> Is anything on-stream?
<Shizuka> 13bbuubbi: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc.html
<DaringDerpy> Shizuka: it costs you the ability to reason
<Lunar_Brony> Crono_brony not atm
<DaringDerpy> not worth it
<cachi01> and now have some chiptune :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TANhL8H6Kok
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: only temporarily, its very unhealthy to constantly be angry
<Shizuka> 13reason, then focus
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka nuff commands?
<Crono_brony> Lunar_Brony: Ah, thanks for the info., I like your name, reminds me of mine. X3
<DaringDerpy> zen this nonsense out...
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: idk, anger doesnt help me think clearly
<DerpyMuffins> Debate still going on?
<Shizuka> 13i'm slow to anger, by the time i am i have gathered more than enough information to deal damage
<cachi01> yep
<twilight_sprinkle> yes DerpyMuffins , obama is winning!
<DaringDerpy> destructive....and you demand trust?
<Shizuka> 13no i don't
<Metronome> TL;DR Wht are u guys discussing?
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: is he?
<DaringDerpy> I have no idea, Metronome
<cachi01> Metronome: max gilardi acctitude
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: i was being silleh D:
<Shizuka> 13i scarcely trust anyone, least of all myself
<Shizuka> 13but that's part and parcel of depression
<cachi01> i dont trust anyone i havent known for atleast 5 years
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: so he isn't?
<DerpyMuffins> You need a hug Shizuka
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: ik, i suspect he is tbh
<Metronome> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljtdaprbo41qafrh6.jpg
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i would guess so too
<Lunar_Brony> Crono_brony thank you! I actually go by 4 aliases: "Canadian_Brony" and "Lunar_Brony" (my regular nicks), Zombie_Brony (joke for when chat is dead), and Science_Brony (self-explanatory).
<CriticKitten> Metronome: No clue, I was asking for several minutes before I gave up and went back to GW2 full-time. >.>;
<DaringDerpy> I think I better be silent...I'm too drunk to not put oil into the fire
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: but depressions int fun, so why keep doing that?
<Shizuka> 13because it's that easy
<Eli> Lunar_Brony: god you are complicated...
<cachi01> CriticKitten: max gilardi attitude at EQLA
<weeping_pegasi82> I guess you could call this art :/ http://hyperion1997.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5hfce3
<DaringDerpy> sarcasm isn't cool
<DaringDerpy> bowties are
<CriticKitten> cachi01: wat
<cachi01> yes it is
<weeping_pegasi82> and yay for visible paper lines!!
<Eli> Shizuka: it's shitty isn't it? even when you know about it, you just can't get out of it
<cachi01> CriticKitten: max gilardi was mean in eqla and now Shizuka and twoiloight_sprunkl are discussing it
<Lunar_Brony> Eli no one can call me complicated unless they know me irl.
<twilight_sprinkle> cashie pls
<cachi01> twoiloight pls
<CriticKitten> Who the hell is Max Gilardi?
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: me
<Lunar_Brony> seriously?
<Jmo> O U Saturn/
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Saturn
<cachi01> xd
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn is hotdiggedydemon!
<CriticKitten> Saturn, you were mean at EQLA?
<Lunar_Brony> wait . . .
<cachi01> oh u Saturn
<CriticKitten> Bad Saturn. No treats for you. :|
<Eli> Lunar_Brony: :P i didn't say you were complicated. i just find your use of names complicated. i was even to lazy to think of something else than my real name
<Saturn> 08,01i have no idea who Max Gilardi is
<cachi01> CriticKitten: max gilardi is hotdiggedydemon. not saturn x
<cachi01> xd
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<Saturn> 08,01well, no
<Saturn> 08,01i'm Saturn
<CriticKitten> Oh, that asshat who makes those shitty .MOV movies?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm famous in the fandom in my own right
<cachi01> Saturn: is best Saturn
<DaringDerpy> time to sleep...have fun everypony :P
<twilight_sprinkle> bye DaringDerpy
<Eli> Saturn: that you are
<twilight_sprinkle> and now i can haz food finally
<DaringDerpy> don't take the fandom more seriously than it deserves
<cachi01> CriticKitten: yep. that cool guy that makes those awesome series
<Crono_brony> Lunar_Brony: My aliases are Cronotrigger148 and crono_brony ( bronystate only) Thing is, everyone thinks my name is related to chrono trigger, but I have never played it. I loved the word "chrono", but despised the "h" in the word. so I mostly put "crono" in most of my aliases...
<CriticKitten> Okay then. So now I know who he is. Now I guess the followup question is "Why should I care if he was mean on-stage? Just call him an asshat, as I did, and move on."
<Saturn> 08,01unfortuantely, i have to take the fandom seriously
<Spell-of-Gaming> Just downloaded Trotmania
<Eli> Crono_brony: you have no time to write the "h" :P
<Saturn> 08,01i run a business involving it
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's actually pretty good
<cachi01> Spell-of-Gaming: cool :) which songs are in it
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: like he never was mean, even before the MOVs
<Spell-of-Gaming> Some songs are fanmade and the others are in the show
<Saturn> 08,01you'd be surprised how much fandom drama can affect a con
<cachi01> Wacky game jokez 4 kidz is awesome
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: Really?
<CriticKitten> Saturn: No I wouldn't.
<Metronome> Just AFKed, Wht are we discussing now?
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: You have to take cartoon ponies seriously? -lol
<JRP2234> i made another remix of the cupcakes song
<MadSurge> cachi01: and the northern incident
<J_E_Smith71> I guess you guys will have to wait till EverFree gets their video of the panel to see what happened, cause Super Brony's not posting it due to the content
<weeping_pegasi82> anybody else watch the pokemon abriged?
*Vordox hugs Saturn.
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: I kinda thought cons were just a thing were a bunch of bronys got together and like...fuckin talked and stuf...
<cachi01> weeping_pegasi82: theres a pokemon abridged?
<Saturn> 08,01Mega_Milk: i run Europe's large MLP convention
<Saturn> 08,01so in a word, yes
<Ponies47> Saturn: Must be alot of work :/
<cachi01> and lots of money
<Saturn> 08,01*largest
<weeping_pegasi82> cachi01: yah I'll post a link
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: So whats the biggest turn out youve hd?
<cachi01> weeping_pegasi82: cool thx :)
<Saturn> 08,01aye, loats of work, lots of money involved
<Saturn> 08,01Mega_Milk: 700
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: Nice
<CriticKitten> MadSurge: I dun care when he started being mean, his works are terrible and apparently he's a jerk to boot, so I've no reason to be anything but blunt in calling him an asshat.
<Lunar_Brony> Crono_brony I use Canadian_Brony and the like on BronyState only; everywhere else, I'm "Ryanier" with a 3-digit number on the end. I was going to use "Ryanier128" here, but for some odd reason it was taken when I first arrived. In the 7 years I used "Ryaneir", only once has it been taken.
<Vordox> Saturn: Still waiting for the 5k?
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: I really need to go to one of those things
<Saturn> 08,01which isn't bronycon size, but we're looking to have 1500 - 2000 next year
<Jmo> lolol
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: Your just always so far away... ;^;
<cachi01> so far away we wait for the daaaaay
*cachi01 tries to remember the lyrics
<Vordox> Here, everyone who is not in the chat. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAabtQZSdlE Have some insanity
*cachi01 fails
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: like, the Ask Jappleack blog is a nice story, now if only he was like that all the time instead of being/pretending to be a jerk
<weeping_pegasi82> cachi01: this isn't the first episode but it's one of my favorites http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0AMrwFNjM&list=SPB332265A0D8A591A&index=13&feature=plpp_video
<Lunar_Brony> I wish I could go to a meet-up or convention, but I'm at that age where I can make reasonable plans, but can't execute most of them due to lack of a driver's license.
<Metronome> Judging by The Conversation above, i Believe Mega_Milk is harassing Saturn, Am i Right?
<Mega_Milk> Metronome: Harrasing?
<JRP2234> Phase4
<Eli> what con is it anyways Saturn?
<cachi01> Metronome: nope
<Metronome> no?
<Mega_Milk> Metronome: Asking questions is harrasment?
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: BUCK
<Mega_Milk> Metronome: please sir.
<CriticKitten> Granted, I guess that means I have to be mean to respond to his meanness, but....meh. I'm okay with that. That's how people picture me anyways, so....no point in disappointing.
<Mega_Milk> Metronome: stfu
<Metronome> Sorry TL;DR
<Saturn> 08,01Metronome: no-one's harrassing me
<Metronome> Just Assuming Things
<thelonepony> Hi Everypony :)
<Vordox> Saturn: I need to be honest with you here..
<Metronome> Sry:'(
<Eli> Saturn: oreally? gonna be there next year i guess
<Vordox> Saturn: You named the con something related to a hind kick
<Mega_Milk> Metronome: you wanna make it up to me?
<cachi01> weeping_pegasi82: well your wrist smells like shit XDD
<CriticKitten> I would never harrass Saturn. Except if he was being mean at EQLA. *evil kitty eye* :|
<Metronome> http://twilight.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133944790110.png
<thelonepony> did i miss PPPS :(
<weeping_pegasi82> cachi01: it gets better :D
<Mega_Milk> Metronome: Give me your wubs (>---___---)> Right now...
<Eli> Vordox: i think it's more because of the U and the K in buck
<Metronome> <(^.^<)
<Vordox> Eli: Maybe, I don't have any hard facts.
<Mega_Milk> Metronome: You are forgiven.
<Metronome> :D
<Metronome> Btw, Wht are we discussing :/
<Eli> Vordox: but you know Saturn. he probably had something else in mind 6_9
<JRP2234> come on equestria daily post my songs
<Crono_brony> Lunar_Brony: I also use soulshift686, hinari.//, and... well, that's pretty much it.
<Vordox> Eli: No idea what you mena
<Eli> Vordox: either you're sarcastic (which you shouldn't be on the internet, trust me) or it's better you really don't :)
<CriticKitten> Anyways, I have a much nicer topic of discussion.
<Vordox> Saturn is a cool dude. =P
<Vordox> And Buck is highly relate dto ponies
<flutterchu> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4tj8ffp7M1qmqg9lo1_500.jpg

<Vordox> But it's still a Hind Kick movement.
<CriticKitten> http://www.welovefine.com/3784-rainbow-dash-hoodie-footie-by-underboss.html <---- And this is that topic: Great thing, or the GREATEST thing?
<flutterchu> so is saturn *nom* the leader and lifegaurd of bronystate
<Saturn> 08,01flutterchu: i'm not the leader, no
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just a mod and a techie
<Lunar_Brony> There should be fonts for different tones of voice. I should be able to say "What a great party. I had so much fun." and type it in "Sarcastica", which is self-explanatory.

<AdamTheDuck> Vordox, for streaming Penn and Tellers Bullshit
<Vordox> So Penn and Teller is ...bannable now?
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<AttackWithHugs> Vordox: TLDR Bullshit episode about porn was shown, it violates the rules so he's not allowed to stream for a month
<Buytoast> porn is
<Vordox> Ah.
<Vordox> Weird..
<DerpyMuffins> Porn is banable
<BLACHI01> aerials in the sky when you lose small mind you free your life.
<Vordox> The chat wanted the one with porn/Orgasm and shit, and when they get it Wrek gets banned.
<Vordox> Bah
<Buytoast> porn is illegal here
<Buytoast> along with opinions and individualism
<twilight_sprinkle> but the internet is for porn, and bronystate is a part of the internet => bronystate is for porn

*AJIsAwesome gives SB a recovery potion
<eddmario> NewSuperBronyU: At least you're back to normal
*eddmario puts on a gas mask because of what AJIsAwesome just gave NewSuperBronyU
<Rex_Mundi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laiZgrIpbcA
<AJIsAwesome> ???
<AJIsAwesome> It's just a recovery potion. It heals injuries. :D
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU hey
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome is the new Alchemist :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Back to normal? D:
<AJIsAwesome> I thought SB was already normal. :D
<eddmario> AJIsAwesome: Except if you use it on someone who was turned to normal by being hit with my frying pan, it makes the person emit lethal doses of methane from their, um, "plot"
<AJIsAwesome> You mean it makes them pass gas?
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU yes?
<AJIsAwesome> Well, that's certainly..interesting. :D
<eddmario> AJIsAwesome: Powerfully enough to make their ass literally explode
<Jmo> Normal people in Browniestate?
<Rex_Mundi> eddmario: You mean, like farting around as if rocket powered?
<Jmo> wat da hell u on abut ayejay
<AJIsAwesome> ??
<AJIsAwesome> What is it, Jaymoo?
<eddmario> Rex_Mundi: I mean as if a bomb was up their ass and it exploded
<Jmo> I swear things just swoop past your mind.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is there a stream yet?
<Jmo> Nevermind Ayejay.
<thelonepony> no
<AJIsAwesome> They don't swoop, Jmo. They go WOOSH! :3
<Jmo> u r still stoopid.
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<eddmario> Luckily I hit him on the head, so it won't cause the exploding ass part, but it'll still be lethal to anyone not wearing a gas mask
<AJIsAwesome> :<
<eddmario> Luckily NewSuperBronyU is immune to the gas because it's coming from his body
<Rex_Mundi> Lets go back to talking about plot or whatever it is us bronies are supposed to be talking about. :P I like the story of "Hurricane Fluttershy"
<SafariMonkey> OK bye everypony, I've been up 20h so as much as I'd like to stay, I better go. :P

*AttackWithHugs blushes :3
<Polydunami> I'm saving my excitement for when the episode actually airs.
<Stary> True, it was stupid that Hasbro made us wait for monts T_T
<Polydunami> I tend to do that :$
<weeping_pegasi82> eeyup with a computer mouse
<Stary> months*
<superretroworld> Stary: well atleast your not a communiy fan
<Rex_Mundi> Im a little sad that you now need an accout to see images on the MLP Arena. I occasionally browse that forum too see what the old schol fans are up too and what they have/have created. But now I cant see thier images.:(
<Stary> superretroworld: Lol
<Polydunami> You mean an account for free?
<Stary> superretroworld: The ones that go to the Bronycons?
<Rex_Mundi> Polydunami: Yeah, but I dont want to sighn up for a sight i wont be posting much in.
<weeping_pegasi82> Rex_Mundi: here http://hyperion1997.deviantart.com/#/d5iyz2v
<superretroworld> Stary: no communitys a show
<Spell-of-Gaming> Why did we wait for months?
<AJIsAwesome> Stary: No, the ones who are fans of the show Community.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Because they're preparing S3, duh.
<Vordox> Anyone here played RE5?
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSMx4yXJu2w
<cachi01> Vordox:
<cachi01> ke
<cachi01> me
<weeping_pegasi82> it's the boulder one isn't it?
<Stary> superretroworld: Oh okay, there are so many categories of Bronies that I tend to get confused >_<
<Vordox> weeping_pegasi82: No it's BETTER
<Rex_Mundi> Vordox: resident evil 4 and 5 are fun but those games were the ones that sent the story into weird places.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/eB7ry.jpg

<Polydunami> http://imalou.deviantart.com/art/Snowing-335850240 This is neat
<Vordox> cachi01: XD
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Daww. :)
<Vordox> What about THAT video, Cachi01 =3
<superretroworld> Stary: i didnt know there were categories
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm hungry -.-
<Stary> superretroworld: Yep, I just searched it up
<superretroworld> cachi01: ...interesting
<d3rb> superretroworld, there are
<cachi01> superretroworld: dat youtube first comment
<Stary> superretroworld: Apparently there's the average Pony fan, the Pony Freak, and the one who just has a major obsession with the show called Pony Addicts
<superretroworld> d3rb: i guess
<Polydunami> http://tomdantherock.deviantart.com/art/Chrysalis-Caramelldansen-335826581? I don't believe this -_(\
<Polydunami> :D
<Rex_Mundi> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc7bbnrJW61rf5g10o1_500.gif
<Vordox> cachi01: Best plan ever right? :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSMx4yXJu2w
<Vordox> my flash hiccuped
<superretroworld> Stary: im the average pony fan, what about you?
<cachi01> Vordox: eeyup :D
<d3rb> superretroworld, a quick browse of somewhere like deviant art or mlp general will quickly show how weird this fandom gets
<superretroworld> superretroworld: of what vid?
<thelonepony> Polydunami: Cute :3
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: You just pinged youself. :3
<Polydunami> Unnervingly so :S
<Stary> superretroworld: Average
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: :D
<superretroworld> cachi01: of what vid?
<cachi01> superretroworld: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSMx4yXJu2w
<weeping_pegasi82> I draw ponies a lot but for some reason I'm drawing a pikachu with a cyborg arm...
<Rex_Mundi> d3rb: Try being an anime or furry fan. Those fandoms get a few special kind of weird people mixed in with the normals that make you question your sanity.
<cachi01> otakus are cool
<d3rb> true Rex_Mundi, it just doesnt help that at its core, this is a kids show
<cachi01> d3rb: little girls?
<cachi01> little girls*
<d3rb> i never said that, i said kids show
<weeping_pegasi82> I think it's a family show
<cachi01> little girls*
<Rex_Mundi> my 5 year old nephew like mlp
<Stary> superretroworld: Huh, I just discovered other types of bronies O_O
<Polydunami> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_magkuiw12C1ry10fwo1_500.gif This is just awesome :D
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: It's more of a family show than a show for girls, IMO.
<d3rb> ^ actually thats probably more accurate than what i said
<superretroworld> Stary: there is the cloppers, but those dont count
<weeping_pegasi82> my 2 year old brother likes the show so much he sings a long with the theme song (he only says pony and the aaaaahhs but still)
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't care if you fap to cartoons
<Jmo> o_O
<Jmo> wat.
<Rex_Mundi> I dont think this fandom has had the "pleasure" of having a person like 'Tumbles the stair dragon'... yet.:D
<Polydunami> I don't need to know, personally :S
*Panda slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
*Panda slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Stary> superretroworld: Yea, theres the normal bronies, fanfiction writer bronies, creepy bronies, sick-minded bronies (otherwise known as cloppers but they don' t count as you said) and then theres the bronies who imply MLP to their life o-o
<Jmo> Pondoo
<d3rb> then theres jmo
<Jmo> ikr?
<cachi01> i liek r34
<weeping_pegasi82> Stary: where do the artistic bronies fit in?
<Polydunami> http://tomat-in-cup.deviantart.com/art/Trick-or-treat-335460132 :3
<superretroworld> cachi01: o.O
<Rex_Mundi> Panda: Well... some of us have interestests that not all bronies have.
<d3rb> cachi01, me too, i love skylines gtr especially
<cachi01> Stary: yay im a sick minded brony
<Panda> Rex_Mundi, im sorry?
<cachi01> d3rb: what u did there i see
<Stary> weeping_pegasi82: Probably in the Awesome, Average Bronies category
<d3rb> :3
<Stary> weeping_pegasi82: There's like an entire discussion of it on Youtube O_O
<Panda> Stary what of the artistic ones who also produce risque and suggestive content.
<Rex_Mundi> I probobly am an adverage brony most of the time, but a MLP fanatic some of the time.
<weeping_pegasi82> whoa
<weeping_pegasi82> how long has it been without a stream? wasn't really keeping track
<Stary> Panda: I'm guessing sick-minded, it depends... If it's mature- sexual content then yeah XD
<Panda> Stary, I see...
<Stary> Panda: But if it's average then your in the awesome category
<Panda> Ok.
<Stary> Yeah I know... Weird O_O
<cachi01> Stary: so wrek is sick minded?
<Rex_Mundi> Why are we judging each other?
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<cachi01> ^^
<Panda> ^^^
<thelonepony> ^^^^
<cachi01> v
<d3rb> ^^^^^
<Stary> I have no idea... I just searched up a list of different types of Broneis so yeah...
<d3rb> dammit cachi01
<cachi01> theres a list of different types of bronies?
<Stary> Yeah
<cachi01> who dafuq came up with that?
<Stary> It's messed up
<Panda> Stary, you shouldnt make generalizations like that.
<Polydunami> It's like a list of the different flavours of vanilla :S
<AdamTheDuck> A list... Wat?
<Stary> Panda: Yeah I know, I just got kinda curious and randomly saw it
<cachi01> Polydunami: anyway they all taste delicious and almost the same
<d3rb> i dont think its so much an actaul list but put bronies into groups
<Polydunami> Yeesh, can't we just all get along? :(
<Stary> d3rb: Yeah, it's not actual, just kinda what the person thinks
<Panda> Stary, why would you generalize them in the first place. I honestly done see the point.
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, Polydunami.
*Panda slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
<AJIsAwesome> ???
<AJIsAwesome> Why did you slap me, Panda?
<Panda> AJIsAwesome ^^ because, pponies
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Stary> Panda: I don't either o_O, lists are made for other things

<Rex_Mundi> Polydunami: They are called fans that dont know self controll. Super fans are only weirdos if they can contain themselves. Cloppers are only sick-minded' if its the only thing they care about. Anime fans are otakus only if they cant operate like human beings, the list goes on.

<Spell-of-Gaming> Fan service
<weeping_pegasi82> so how many people here are actually talking?
<AJIsAwesome> I am.
<thelonepony> i am
<Arcane> I am
<Spell-of-Gaming> I am.
<thelonepony> not that much atm
*AdamTheDuck rolls around

<AJIsAwesome> I wonder what would happen if we kicked everyone and only the people who really talked in chat a lot would come back. :D
<weeping_pegasi82> *facehoof*
<Arcane> I'm talking I tend to say what im typing while i'm typing it. And i tend to read out too
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: we can try
<Arcane> out loud*
<Spell-of-Gaming> Some people have plugins that make them come back when they're kicked, though
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I would just like to see how many people we would have in here. Lots of people just log in and leave chat on. :D
<Jmo> Huh
<Jmo> Maybe I am
<Jmo> Maybe I'm not
<Polydunami> Yeah... no, that's taken care of, Spell-of-Gaming
<weeping_pegasi82> thelonepony: VVVVUUUUUULLLPIIIXX
<Arcane> Some one link a cute video
<d3rb> i dont see the point of kicking inactive, theyre not taking up space
<Ryunosuke> i admit, i lurk alot in here
<Polydunami> I lurk somewhat as well...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lurk ?
<Polydunami> But then I stick around with nothing to say otherwise :P
<d3rb> i get easily distracted from chat, need a bigger monitor
<Spell-of-Gaming> I lurk only when I have no idea what is being talked about
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind people being inactive, it just would be interesting seeing how many people would log back in manually if they were kicked. :D

<Jmo> ahahahahah
<shana> lol
<Spell-of-Gaming> Schedules are for the weak
<Vordox> There's been talk back and forth between Streamers sometimes, and something about queues and stuff
<prince-dari> Ahh
<prince-dari> Queues, yes
<Vordox> This hints at a structure, most likely s chedule
<SpeccyRush> itz a supplies
<prince-dari> Schedules, no
<prince-dari> :P
<Vordox> So...
<Vordox> Organized chaos? :P
<Wrek> 05eugh

<SpeccyRush> haiya Wrek
<alexxm> hope you feel better Wrek
<XAX> Wrek: Where'd ya take yourself on vacation?
<Wrek> 05just went to my aunt for a week
<Rainboom> Hi everyone
<Vordox> prince-dari: Speaking about streaming
<XAX> i c. Is that far from where you live?
<prince-dari> Yep? <:
<Vordox> prince-dari: How's the "When noone stream, something is shown" on the stream? :P
<Wrek> 05just 2 hours with car
<prince-dari> It just shows the last thing before they stopped streaming
<Vordox> Nono
<Vordox> I mean, I remember Phase and Ghosties talking about making something stream when noone is streaming, most likely a Playlist
<prince-dari> Ahh
<prince-dari> That
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The pony episode playlist?
<SpeccyRush> Soonâ¢
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, you mean like Livestream?
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Nah, random stuff. :P
<Vordox> Pony related
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Livestream does that
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Can't do Live stream as a user
<Gold_Demona> Similar to that livestream recording of Earthbound.
<Vordox> Due to how it's different for each person
<Vordox> Would cauase a unsync
<Vordox> an*
<Vordox> Atleast,that is what I remember Phase talking about
<Rainboom> cause*
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, do you know Livestream
<Vordox> Rainboom: I'M TIReD OF MY LIFE OKAY
<CrimsonPhoenix> as in the site
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> and how it has autoplay
<Vordox> And Justin, Ustream, GAmerStream etc etc
<Rainboom> k :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> and do you know how that autoplay works?
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeaaah but...Unsyyyync?
<CrimsonPhoenix> not unsync
<Wrek> 05time to completly reinstall skyrim
<Vordox> It will. =P
<Vordox> Wrek: <.< Thought you were done
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, I've never unsync in my life with my streaming
<Wrek> 05done?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I've used Livestream for 2 years
<Vordox> Wrek: With Skyrim
<CrimsonPhoenix> if you unsync it's YOUR problem
<Wrek> 05as did I
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: You tried to stream a non live stream?
<Wrek> 05but ik eep modding it
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: To about 200 people?
<Vordox> Wrek: That swam trek. :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> I believe we have a different definition of un-sync
<CrimsonPhoenix> I was thinking of audio video unsync
<CrimsonPhoenix> you're thinking of connection speed
<Vordox> I'm talking about viewing the same thing
<Vordox> As I recall that I talke about a certain unsycn for EACH specific person ehre
<Vordox> Not Unsync as audio or visual
<Vordox> But a completely different view
<Spell-of-Gaming> Unsync?
<Spell-of-Gaming> You mean ping, right?
<CrimsonPhoenix> some people might take time to throw their content mostly due to connection speed
<Vordox> ...
<Gold_Demona> Vordox: Doesn't refreshing the stream solve that problem?
<CrimsonPhoenix> EXACTLY what Spell-of-Gaming said
<CrimsonPhoenix> PING
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: No, it'll restart your Livestream to the latest one in the playlist
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gold_Demona, temporarily
<killerpony7733> Wrek 3x station cash today depending on what amount you pay for for PS2
<prince-dari> If you just embed a playlist, everyone going to be at different points in it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it'll go back to that DELAY
<Vordox> Thank you prince-dari :P
<prince-dari> Is the point he's trying to make.
<Gold_Demona> ah
<killerpony7733> Wrek For in PS2*
<Vordox> prince-dari: Dat English
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ping is the miliseconds of what travels to you, IIRC
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, livestream ain't youtube sync
<Vordox> Spell-of-Gaming: Ping is the response
<Vordox> Not the send
<Vordox> Ping = Sends a ping, and wait for it to come back
<Vordox> The travel back and forth = Ping MS
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yeah, I just got a bit confused
<prince-dari> Livestream only lets you play previous steraming sessions I think
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, wrong
<CrimsonPhoenix> you can add youtube videos
<Vordox> YOU DARE CALL A MOD WRONG
<Vordox> HERETIC
<CrimsonPhoenix> in a studio
*Vordox snores in his dream.
<Vivix> moorniing Jmo
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, yes cause I have 2 years experiance
<SpeccyRush> I called a mod nerd once, nothing happened
<Jmo> Why would you scream morning at me
<Jmo> It's neither morning for either of us.
<Vivix> cuuuuz Ii..
<prince-dari> But can you lock everyone to the same point in the video?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I even remember the time when Livestream was called Mogulus
<Vivix> well..yeah
<Jmo> >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, IT WILL lock everyone to the same video
<SpeccyRush> CrimsonPhoenix: you old
<prince-dari> Becuase if they can just change what's playing on their stream, then it's kind of pointless
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, think of it like a TV station
<Vivix> what will what now?
<CrimsonPhoenix> You're in control
<CrimsonPhoenix> you choose your video
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Noone is in control
<Vordox> That's the thing =P
<prince-dari> Does it stop them from dragging the buffer bar along though?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, you're wrong
<CrimsonPhoenix> you can control what video can be displayed
<Vordox> I've been wrong before. :P So go ahead.
<CrimsonPhoenix> in a studio
<Vordox> Explain, cause I have no idea about this
<Vordox> Except the things I got told by other
<Vivix> What are you guys taalking about?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and you can even let the studio do it itself
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: So like an radio station?
<Vordox> Cause that's what we need
<infernap12> can you use synch tube?
<CrimsonPhoenix> exactly
<CrimsonPhoenix> or TV station
<CrimsonPhoenix> THOUGH
<CrimsonPhoenix> I must say
<prince-dari> Not sure if we can embed a synctube
<CrimsonPhoenix> that was 1 or 2 years ago
<infernap12> there has to be a way
<Vivix> synchtube works on embedding and controlling youtube, so ne we can't
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe livestream became more jewish now and need to be paid
<Vordox> BIGOTRY DETECTED
<Vordox> activate turn back to
<prince-dari> Please don't make comments like that. :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> but still I used livesstream as an example
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: This is intruiging...
<Vordox> Maybe we could use it
<Vordox> If what tou say is true that is
<Vordox> Tell Phase or Ghosties about this
<CrimsonPhoenix> though another problem with livestream
<CrimsonPhoenix> when you start a channel you have only 50 viewers limit
<CrimsonPhoenix> to remove that
<CrimsonPhoenix> you need to verify your channel
<prince-dari> We do have some verified channels
<CrimsonPhoenix> and OH GOSH is that annoying
<Vordox> prince-dari: Wanna try out Livestream and see if it works?
<Vordox> If you have time that is
<prince-dari> I'll look into it
<Vordox> This could help save time for Phase especially
<Vordox> TO CELEBRATE THIS OCCASION
<Vordox> Of a possible good future
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxnGaURm3B8
<Vordox> HAVE SOME HEART
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, http://www.livestream.com/studio/
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is where mods go to put in videos and CUE them
<Vordox> Don't talk to me about it :P
<Vivix> So what you guys are trying is--playlists and changing embeds?
<Vordox> Vivix: When noone is streaming, there'll be a playlist playing
<Vivix> Ooooh~~
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUMcA--ejOc <3
<Vordox> That almost spells Sumica...
<CrimsonPhoenix> hehe
*Vordox wanna hijack the stream and play games on it...
<Vordox> exposure for playing games on backlog
<Vordox> Go
<Vivix> Is there an auto-switch for the premiere? So people don't have to refresh to change embed?
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ancJUTA94eY&feature=bf_next&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&shuffle=345985 And some Ponies:P

<prince-dari> Why doesn't youtube just implement looping as a feature?
<Vordox> Without the use of any other tool
<Vordox> prince-dari: People would be stuck forever. :P
<Vordox> You need to have comments enabled
<Vordox> Or annotions
<Vordox> Whatever ou call it
<prince-dari> If you look top left before it loops
<Vordox> Yeah
<prince-dari> The little timer thing comes up
<Vordox> It has something to do with a delayer
<Vordox> I know
<Vordox> But this means..

<Deacon> allo Alchemist
<Alchemist> Which mod do I have to ask if a movie is eligible for bmn?
<Vordox> ONE LAST VIDEO ABOUT DERPY
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
<Alchemist> Hi Deacon !
<Vordox> Alchemist: You send it in via Newsletter
<Vordox> That survey is the movie ltotery
<alexxm> how've you been Alchemist
<Deacon> Alchemist I think go up to either one of them
<Vordox> Okay...
<Vordox> Last one
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1cdV4j1Gi0
<Vordox> :P
<Vordox> BYE
*Vordox goes lurk
<Alchemist> Vordox: I know that but they excluded one of my coices before and I would like to know if I can even enter it as a choice.
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Deacon> yup, 6 in 10, always works
<Vordox> Alchemist: Think...you know...commonly.
<Vivix> Opening youtube with HTML5 gives me 3 GET errors, Uncaught TypeError and a Resource warning, and a black screen.
<Vordox> And lawl at you too Phase4 =P
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, BerryPunch dislikes your lurking
<Vivix> I think Chrome broke youtube
<Vordox> My timing on my kicks is a mastery in itself
<Vordox> Phase4: Clearly.
<CrimsonPhoenix> >What about the? bubble wrap? Everyone loves bubble wrap!
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, TypeError in javascript. one of the most anoying kinds of errors
<CrimsonPhoenix> THOSE TIME CONSUMMING BUBBLE WRAP
<Vivix> Yeahh~~
<Vivix> It's strange though, html5 youtube no longer works in chrome at all for me- probably beta update
<CrimsonPhoenix> Seriously those bubble wrap are like demons
<Vivix> flash palyer works, but nothing else. Have to use another browser
<CrimsonPhoenix> the moment you see one, it gives you that urge to pop a bubble
<Phase4> 00,02i wish firefox suported h264
<CrimsonPhoenix> EVERYTIME
<Vivix> You think they'll standardize that too eventually?
<Phase4> 00,02or at least had the ability to be extended to suport h264
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, i hope they standardize ogv simply because the mpeg consortium does not deserve any of the money it makes
<Vordox> MOAR DERPY
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zqlVJNsI4o
<Vordox> MWHAUHAUAH
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, it'll do that at the version 16.0
<Phase4> 00,02but in reality thats probably not going to happen
<Vivix> Hehe, mpeg is getting rich- yeah
<Vivix> Fraunhofer makes millions on mp3 licenses
<SpeccyRush> CrimsonPhoenix: http://derpiboo.ru/129953
<CrimsonPhoenix> See Luna knows what I'm talking about
<Vordox> Awww Spell-of-Gaming
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, i wonder... flash has a licence for h264 right?
<CrimsonPhoenix> If one see a Bubble wrap, they shall not see the day
<CrimsonPhoenix> tru fact
<Vivix> hmm- not sure, they can process it in Adobe?
<Vivix> I mean if Adobe Flash can export or import h264/MP4 stuff, they have to have the license
<Jmo> Such a nerd combo Vivix/Phase
<Jmo> :P
*Vivix frutilessly slaps Jmo
<Jmo> Your goaticorns will pay that.
<Vivix> Noo!
*Vivix is quiet and nice and obedient
<Vordox> AND FINAL DERPY VID
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gwObcjGCVA
<Vordox> :D
<Tervicz> No, she's not dead. I have the original episode still on my HD
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, the licencing terms for h264 do not actually state the restrictions of the licence
<Vordox> Tervicz: The video is awesome still :P
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, going by this anyway http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/AVC/Documents/AVC_TermsSummary.pdf
<Vivix> Okay- reason for unstandard in video tag is because- Mozilla and Opera believes that HTML5 should be patent free- whilst Chrome, Apple and apparently MS adopted H264
<Phase4> 00,02which is a pricing guide more than a licence
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, chrome suports both, ms suports only h264
<Vivix> yyeah
<alexxm> test
<Vivix> Hm- I'm guessing then that the company that maintains or creates the browsers are the ones who pay this-
<Phase4> 00,02i think apple suports both also
<Phase4> 00,02infact is ms causing problems
<Phase4> 00,02as usual
<Vivix> Safari only has MP4 according to the list here-
<Vivix> Chrome supports WebM, MP4 and Ogg, so it's the only one on the list that supports everything
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good afternoon everyone :)

<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Donarion :)

<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYET93z5edk&feature=autoplay&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&playnext=2 HAVE SOME AIR COBAT
<MadSurge> Alchemist: never thought a movie with such a premise would be so BORING, right?
<Alchemist> it was stupid, nevermind boring
<MadSurge> Alchemist: the ten thousand feet leap was the only worthwile scene :D
<Alchemist> MadSurge: and the glowing sex
<MadSurge> Alchemist: luckily 12 Angry Men was much better than I expected
<Alchemist> you haven't seen it before? Yeah, it is a great movie.
<Alchemist> There is another movie which is dialoge driven and its pretty cool. Its "The man from earth".
<RosePetal> Does anyone have the lottery results from Friday?
<Alchemist> many others downrated it
<MadSurge> Alchemist: we don't get to see those movies here, unless it's at like 3 am in obscure movies programs
<Alchemist> MadSurge: ummm, torrent?
<CrimsonPhoenix> So yeah
<Gold_Demona> What movie we talkin' about?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Moonstuck is over
<MadSurge> Alchemist: I didn't even know of its existence
<CrimsonPhoenix> .....SLICE OF LIFE HERE I COME
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: 12 angry men
<Gold_Demona> ah
<Gold_Demona> Never seen it. :P
<SpeccyRush> that was a good movie
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hey Alchemist LET'S DO SCIENCE
<RosePetal> Lottery results anyone?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll grab the vials you get the liquid
<CrimsonPhoenix> We must make it glow
<CrimsonPhoenix> RosePetal, How to train your dragon, suited for success, Jetson movie, Ticket Master
<RosePetal> ok. thanks.
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: okay, what your plan? Do you want to do fluorescence or phosphorescence?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: a juror manages to turn all the others to a verdict of reasonable doubt through nothing but logic and pointing out flaws in the case
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't know just make it glow
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ooh!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and one of the jurors is the original Piglet voice :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Heh!
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: I recommend this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tItOOpyJP5k (I also love that guy's channel)
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d5k0xio
