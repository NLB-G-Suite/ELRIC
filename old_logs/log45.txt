*Darky runs
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like being considered one of the youngest in a group of people
<Skylands> 10^
<Angel_Espeon> 13Unfortunately that rarely happens because I'm one of the oldest in my year group |D
<Skylands> 10All my IRL friends are younger than me
<Skylands> 10Not by years, but months and such
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Lati> 12I look younger than I am =P
<Lati> 12I think
<Anthony> everyone I know is around 14-16

<eXAKR> I had some Oreos as a snack today
<Anthony> I miss making scripts
<Anthony> I remember I made only one successful script with the help of Feather
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't know HOW to make scripts |D
<eXAKR> I was just looking for some snack food from a vending machine that doesn't require getting your fingers dirty
<Anthony> and that was back when I was... 14?
<eXAKR> And the Oreos were sitting there
<eXAKR> Nice.
<eXAKR> !oreos
<Anthony> EccoCode.
<eXAKR> Angel_Espeon
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<eXAKR> Maybe you can get Ascendant's help on that
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nah, I don't really have an interest in making scripts anyway :P
<Anthony> D:
<Anthony> whoa lag
<eXAKR> Nooo
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not even an ownership script, because I find it amusing when people try to claim me when they can't :3c
<Lati> 12how are they rare items if you sell the SAME THING all the time
<Anthony> lol dont you just hate it
<Anthony> when you are playing a game
<Anthony> then you lag.
<Anthony> and then everything comes at you at once
<Anthony> its like.. BAM.

<Ray> 02Yes.
<Anthony> brb food
<Lati> 12when the events start it LAGGGS

<Elision> haha
<prince-dari> I watched the first airing of MLP in the UK.
<RainBroDash> >mfw I realise that it's Ponies/BE A MAN/Nigel Thornberry/ITS FRIDAY NIGHT/ebrbrbrbrbrbr/every other bloody video we watch
<RainBroDash> DARI NO WHEN WAS IT
<RainBroDash> I MISSED IT?!
<prince-dari> 4th of July.
<RainBroDash> It was on CN yeah?

<RainBroDash> I have sky, I was going to record it Q_Q
<prince-dari> I was kind of disappointed.
<SirSprinkles> 6That's pretty awesome, RainBro.
<RainBroDash> yeah my mum would probably flip her shit
<RainBroDash> she's worried about me as it is
<prince-dari> They didn't even say anything about it.
<RainBroDash> then again they knew I watched cartoons quite late in childhood
<RainBroDash> but this is MLP D:
<SirSprinkles> 6Show her I, Brony
<SirSprinkles> 6Best vid ever for getting the family on your side. =D
<prince-dari> When we were younger my sister and I watched the powerpuff girls, and we've watched foster's home for imaginary friends before, so I'll probably convert her some time.
<RainBroDash> my sister and I were quite seperate during childhood
<prince-dari> We used to argue a lot at a younger age, she was pretty miserable so she ended up taking it out on me, not that she meant to.
<prince-dari> We get on really now though.
*^ slaps Altair around with a pin
<RainBroDash> well I live with just my mum, but when my dad left I was 4, she was 8. So it rattled her even more than it did to me
<Altair> wut
<Altair> :(
<prince-dari> Welp.
<RainBroDash> she'd already gotten really close with him, a real daddys girl, so when my mum pissed he off she just left the house and went to my dad's for some indeterminate amount of time, leaving me to deal with my mother on my own :P

<Aurora> 6about 6:30, I remembered I had youtube on my phone, so shut irc off and went to watch stuff
<drf-Droid> this is why generators ftw
<Aurora> 6battery had 20 minutes left >.<
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> around here
<drf-Droid> if the power goes out in the winter

<Aurora> 6yeah we dont have that problem
<drf-Droid> so we got a $6500 generator
<drf-Droid> I'm like
<drf-Droid> if natural gas never goes out
<Aurora> 6what our problem was was that it was a really hot day yesterday, and this is a senior park
<Aurora> 6thank god the power went out in the late afternoon
<drf-Droid> why not run the power lines through those pipes LOL
<Aurora> 6not the morning and through the day
<drf-Droid> o.o
<drf-Droid> isn't late afternoon hotter?
<Aurora> 6around here, it cools off by 4
<drf-Droid> and I misread that as senior prank
<Aurora> 6we live by the ocean, so we get the breeze
<EpicStatsGuy> :з / :З / :3 / :³ / є: / E: / :Э / Є: / :э
<Aurora> 6LOL senior prank
<Aurora> 6reminds me of when the class of '02 filled the school's pool with jello mix
<Aurora> 6not nearly enough to get the desired result
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Aurora> 6but enough to cause the school to drain it for the summer and half the school year
<drf-Droid> so wait, senior park? what's that o.o
<Aurora> 6senior citizen park?
<Aurora> 6a place where old people live
<drf-Droid> you live in a park?
<Aurora> 6park as in trailer park
<Darky> 06bags

<Aristeo> Hi Kitten :)
<Darky> 06thats why it's funny

<drf-Droid> :/
<Darky> 06O.o
<drf-Droid> yay taking screenshots?
<Darky> 06sometimes
<Aurora> 6yeah going home early looks better
<Aurora> 6as weird as it sounds
<drf-Droid> odd
<Aurora> 6not really
<Aurora> 6if you call in sick, your boss wouldn't even see you
<Aurora> 6so you caould assume that instead of calling off sick, you went out of town
<Aurora> 6at least leaving early, you show you've put in the effort to try
<Aurora> 6and just can't do it
<Aurora> 6as for counting against you
<Aurora> 6leaving early counts against us at target, but HR will treat you like a person and understands those better than the day off
<drf-Droid> LOL
<drf-Droid> I just know you're allowed x sick days
<Aurora> 6we don't have that
<drf-Droid> so I would use them if I had the/
<drf-Droid> m
<Aurora> 6what we have is that if you get 5 marks within a month, you're on warning
<Aurora> 6a 6th mark is a write up
<Aurora> 6and 7th would be termination
<drf-Droid> marks?
<Aurora> 6a mark is given if you're late by half an hour, leave early, or call off
<drf-Droid> hm
<drf-Droid> I dunno what kmart does
<Aurora> 6I got put on warning because I had a fair mixture of those, but I'm not even sure how I got that "going home early" mark xD
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Aurora> 6I do remember my half hour late mark, I thought my shift started at 7, not 6 x.x
<Aurora> 6my leader called me like "you coming in today?"
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Darky> 06i'm working every morning in the vacation
<Darky> 06on the bright side
<Darky> 06my boss here is my dad :P
<drf-Droid> I'm not working
<Aurora> 6I can't imagine working for my dad lol
<drf-Droid> but 7 hours of class a day is like X.X
<Aurora> 6I mean, I'm not defiant or anything, I listen to him completely
<Aurora> 6I just can not imagine listening to him FOR A JOB
<Darky> 06xD
<Darky> 06i work like 4-5 hours a day for him
<Darky> 06he owns a building contracters company
<Darky> 06and he needed extra hands
<Darky> 06and i needed some cash, so it's pretty even :3
<Aurora> 6dude
<Aurora> 6I saw a "Help Wanted" sign
<Aurora> 6for the first time
<Aurora> 6EVER
<Aurora> 6at blockbuster o.o
<drf-Droid> LOL
<drf-Droid> that's what I call good job security
*drf-Droid runs
<drf-Droid> inb4 help wanted in tearing the place down
<Aurora> 6ironically enough, that blockbuster lost half its south wall to a drunk driver a couple months ago
<Aurora> 6and still hasn't been fixed
<Aurora> 6it's a wooden board right now :D
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Aurora> 6it's funny though

<Lambda> that's your specialty
<Dee_Twenty> 0Sol: You can't possibly suck as hard as I do at TF2. Not only am I not big on multi-player, I generally HATE FPS.
<Polarfire> I bet I n00b more.
<Dashite> Exscalibrony Nice! I've been following since about chapter 14.

<Ghosties> 4It's what...every ticket is a drawing?
<Suinide> I dont get the Hub
<Icydragon> 13Lame
<prince-dari> Where do you live?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, what Dashite said
<Exscalibrony> Yeah, 100 grand prize winners
<RainBroDash> 10oh i see
<Elision> oh fuck
<Dee_Twenty> 0That's precisely the problem though, it feels like you're paying $60 for a 12 year old game.
<Elision> I forgot about that sale
<Ghosties> 4TOO BAD I WON'T GET DRAWN LOL
<Hogia> 7hi
<RainBroDash> 10TOO BAD I WHILE LOL

<RainBroDash> 10hawkward
<Ghosties> 4You're English, and can't even type it properly
<Dashite> RainBroDash can't brain tonight. He has the dumb.
<Suinide> Lol creeper
<Ghosties> 4Fail, sir
<Elision> http://i.imgur.com/aKe2I.gif
<RainBroDash> 10what Dashite said, it be true.
*Armageddon slaps Drake
<Armageddon> :3
<Dee_Twenty> 0For the price of DNF I could put a preorder for ME3 instead.
<rubenflonne> lol elision
<Elision> (suddenly, Elision with a .gif)
<Suinide> Oklahoma. I get it, but i dont have it on my package, even if i did i still wouldnt watch it, i refuse
<Ghosties> 4Dee_Twenty
<Drake> 04wat
<RainBroDash> 10Elision you make me giggle :3
<Ghosties> 4What's the problem?
<Suinide> Satelite package*
<rubenflonne> blah ME3
<Dashite> For the price I paid for DNF I could have bought two games.
<Elision> are there any ghosties around?
<rubenflonne> i am enjoy it
<rubenflonne> and normally i am picky about my game
<rubenflonne> games**
<Zephyr> Heya Arma, everyone
<Dashite> Also, gamestop can go to hell for not having any copies of PS3 Vanquish today.
<rubenflonne> fucking all E3 was shit storm
<Hogia> 7o.o
<RainBroDash> 10nopEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Hogia> 7hi
<rubenflonne> only handful i am looking forward to
<Dashite> $10 sale and not a single PS3 copy in town. :/
<Dee_Twenty> 0The price of Duke Nukem Forever is just too unreasonable, charging full price for a 12 year old game? Fuck that noise.
<rubenflonne> disgaea 4
<Ghosties> 4Well, it JUST came out though
<Stormy> Wait Suinide, so are you a brony or not? :P
<Dee_Twenty> 0The game's worth $20, MAYBE $30.
<rubenflonne> i got balls of steel for 70 bucks
<rubenflonne> worth it
<Ghosties> 4It didn't get a real new makeover until Gearbox got a hold of it, and that was like a year and a half ago or so
<Lambda> the only person here who I don't know their location is icy
<Suinide> Im a brony, im just to pissed to watch them
<Lambda> Icy is a brit, right?
<prince-dari> LO NO
<prince-dari> LOL*
<rubenflonne> right
<Dashite> I still need to finish DNF though. I got sidetracked by Dungeon Siege 3 and Frozen Synapse.
<prince-dari> Florida or something.
<Stormy> LO NO
<Suinide> Ill tell you where he is...to far away from me...hes puerto rican lambda sheesh
<Lambda> ah, he strikes me as british for some reason'
<Lambda> LO AND BEHOLD NO
<rubenflonne> i kinda got went right
<Dashite> Haven't finished those yet either.
<rubenflonne> when my D&D session
<rubenflonne> i still need to pick up DNF again
<RainBroDash> 10Seriously dude, i cant see that pass anywhere
<RainBroDash> 10ghosties
<Ghosties> 4Hmm
<Stormy> crap, one minute
<Ghosties> 4I'll look again
<Bjornfot> 0DNF is pretty good... for being 12 years old
<Suinide> Nooo
<Elision> so I totally forgot Ghosties was in here when I said that
<Elision> true story
<Dashite> I left off at the Duke Burger level.
<Exscalibrony> Sorry, Duke just can't live up to the hype
<Dee_Twenty> 0Just because it just came out doesn't justify charging the same price for it as for a new, modern game, especially when it feels all around unpolished.
<Lambda> Stormy! Nooooo!
<Suinide> *holds stormy here, my evil ipod blocking the timeout*
<rubenflonne> i left off after his dream
<Lambda> *adds forcefield power to ixr's hold*
<Lambda> we
<Lambda> must
<Lambda> hold
<Lambda> this line
<Suinide> Gah
<rubenflonne> incepetion
<NewDCD> 9he's still around but I told him it'd be better to talk so tomorrow
<NewDCD> 9btw Ghostier
<NewDCD> 9in the steam group
<Dashite> I don't think you can go any deeper in DNF. It's too shallow.
<NewDCD> 9are you the only one allowed to post announcements?
<Ghosties> 4QUESTION
<Dashite> ANSWER
<Dee_Twenty> 0I agree, it's a pretty good game, in it's own right, it's just not worth the price tag.
<Lambda> We lost her
<Lambda> she disconnected from Gmail
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> we have failed
<rubenflonne> thats why i knocked off my price
*SilverSonic contiunes to idle.
<Ghosties> 4Does anyone here know if it's possible to send a Guest Pass to a friend from a game they bought if they didn't send it upon getting the passes to give?
<rubenflonne> thanks to my friends that work at game places
<Suinide> *dies*
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<rubenflonne> 70 bucks for balls of steel
<rubenflonne> worth the price
<SilverSonic> o-o
<Lambda> Alas, we have lost two in the battle today
<Drake> 04Ok
<Armageddon> Drake ,3
<Armageddon> <3
<Armageddon> how are you, Zephyr?
<Drake> 04I'm gonna have a break from reading Spyro FFs
<Dashite> Depends on if the pass has an expiration date I'd think.
<Armageddon> okay
*Armageddon hugs Drake
*Armageddon goes to write Reminiscence
<Drake> 04HOW MANY CHAPTERS HAS THIS GUY WRITTEN
<Dee_Twenty> 0I'd just as soon spend that $70 on pony merch.
<NewDCD> 9I see
<NewDCD> 9I was wondering if other administrators could do so
<Drake> 04We're almost to the 100 chapter mark. And it's only Book 2 of 3
<Ghosties> 4You guys are officers
<Drake> 04Admittedly, each chapter is only around 1000 words.
<Drake> 04But still.
<Lambda> Hey guys, have any of you seen my declaration of war on the non-bronies of spyroforum?
<prince-dari> ...aaaaaaaaaand timeout.
<rubenflonne> xD
<Lambda> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-351399.html#351399
<Ghosties> 4You're one above regular users
<rubenflonne> importing to equestria
<RainBroDash> 10oh shit
<Suinide> Bleck
<RainBroDash> 10im not in the steam group, just remembered
<Ghosties> 4So you can delete comments and some other things
<rubenflonne> the true capilist radio is hopefully gone
<RainBroDash> 10laaawl
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, you are, aren't you?
<rubenflonne> capitalist**
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> Can anypony here help me with something art-related?
<Icydragon> 13Lambda: Now why would yu thinkthat?
<Armageddon> o-o
<Lambda> dunno
<rubenflonne> whats up
<RainBroDash> 10nope, not that im aware of
<Lambda> just curious
<Armageddon> that'd be around
<Lambda> I know for sure dari still goes there
<Armageddon> 100000 words
<Ghosties> 4The pass has a two day limit on it...and I got the game like three days ago T_T
<RainBroDash> 10I was still debating it. since i have irl friends on steam
<Lambda> not sure if you two do
<Dee_Twenty> 0Unless by art you mean writing or baking I doubt I'll be much help.
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Ghosties> 4DUDE
<Ghosties> 4DO IT
<Lambda> I never see you post anymore
<Dashite> Check your guest passes.
<Drake> 04I could beat that in a single book of about 20 chapters.
<Armageddon> I don't know how much Reminiscence has
*Drake runs
<Drake> 04NS
<Ghosties> 4I don't know how
<NewDCD> 9real friends won't give a damn dude
<Drake> 04I'm pretty sure
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure I sent them off
<Hogia> 7.-.
<RainBroDash> 10No offense to you guys, i love you and my friends would too. But every single one I tell about the ponies flips their shit at me
<Drake> 04Reminiscence beats it
<NewDCD> 9at most they'll tease you
<Dashite> In the steam client.
<Armageddon> XD
<Zephyr> I'm doing pretty well, you? Sorry for the late responses, I'm always multitasking haha
<Icydragon> 13sometimes i do
<Armageddon> don't worry Zephyr XD
<junh1024-XD> `.`
<Ghosties> 4Just ignore 'em
<Dashite> It's under the games menu. Manage guest passes.
<Armageddon> heh Drake
<NewDCD> 9well, y'know
<Armageddon> Reminiscence's early chapters are short
<Suinide> I dont...and i dont think i should
<Dashite> gift and guest passes*
<NewDCD> 9it's one thing trying to get 'em into ponies
<Drake> 04As is everyone's
<Icydragon> 13You can...
<RainBroDash> 10It's just difficult, being a WoW-nerd turned socialite dude. I've done my best to make a name for myself being NORMAL
<Armageddon> derp
<Drake> 04But you make up for it in a 16000+ chapter
<Suinide> Why?
<RainBroDash> 10and now, ponies.
<Ghosties> 4AH, thanks Dashite!
<Armageddon> 16510
<Dashite> No problem.
<NewDCD> 9well dude, it's your call
<NewDCD> 9but remember
<Suinide> Should i?
<Suinide> No...
<Icydragon> 13Yes
<Icydragon> 13Do it
<Ghosties> 4Oh, and RBD, I just resent the guest pass
<NewDCD> 9"nobody in this world is normal. that word is but an illusion"
<Ghosties> 4My manager says I did send it to you, but I resent it just to be sure
<RainBroDash> 10Ghosties, just got it, installan
<Hogia> 7@_#
<Ghosties> 4Niiiiiiiiiiiiiice
<Lambda> Do eet
<Ghosties> 4We should totally get on, DCD should join us
<RainBroDash> 10NewDCD I know right, and I pride myself on being loopy. But shit like being a basement dweller just means you dont get invited out, ever
<Dashite> Hmm, 3 Deus Ex, 1 Frozen Synapse and 1 HL2:EP1 copies left to give away.
<Suinide> What if i see...one of them...
<RainBroDash> 10being thought of as a basement dweller*
<Ghosties> 4Dude, you look NOTHING like a "basement dweller"
<Polarfire> So is streaming done for tonight:(
<Dashite> Yup.
<RainBroDash> 10I was one :D
<Exscalibrony> Call me oatmeal, but how in the world do you get multiples of the same game?
<prince-dari> I don't live in a basement, I live in my room. :>
<Ghosties> 4You're too pretty to be one :3
<RainBroDash> 10I've changed, but people still warn me that I'm 'refluxing'

<Suinide> ...
<RainBroDash> 10DCD
<RainBroDash> 10whats your steam?
<Polarfire> But I also like lennon's solo stuff.
<Suinide> Who are you referring to as "them@
<Suinide> "*
<Lambda> if you mean the people I think you do
<Lambda> Vulcan and crew
<Polarfire> he was a genius.
<Suinide> Hah.
<Dashite> Yeah, I heard MP was pretty meh.
<NewDCD> 9New DCD
<Dashite> I have it on PC though.
<NewDCD> 9shocking, I know XD
<Sol> Mods kick mods... INECPTION
<Suinide> What about nintendo freak
<NewDCD> 9anyways
<NewDCD> 9g'nite
<Polarfire> Lennon actually called Dig a pony crap himself.
<Ghosties> 4See you later mang
<RainBroDash> 10I searched that! D:
<rubenflonne> i think we could still play with eachother dash
<Lambda> him I like, but I haven't seen him either
<RainBroDash> 10ill find it on the steam page for BMn, night dude
<Polarfire> I love it, its one mf my fav's.
<Sol> Polarus: He was a genius
<Ghosties> 4It's probably "NewDCD"
<Ghosties> 4no space
<Exscalibrony> Who's evryones favorite mane and background pony?
<Suinide> I dont want to if hes there
<rubenflonne> also thats listening to morons who like MW2
<Sol> *Polarfire, sorry, can
<rubenflonne> MP
<Exscalibrony> Fluttershy and Derpy here
<Sol> 't brain
<Armageddon> lmao
<RainBroDash> 10>finding on the BMN steam page either way
<rubenflonne> fluttershy and doctor whoofs
<Icydragon> 13Nah, he's gone
<Polarfire> np.
<Dashite> You've got three guess for mane and the good Doctor for background.
<Suinide> How do you know? Im not going if hes there
<Polarfire> I've been called polarflare repeatedly by somebody... haha
<Polarfire> Can't remember who.
<mib_weu3cr> why.... hallo there
<Dee_Twenty> 0Now now, one can like Modern Warfare 2 without being a moron, I'm sure plenty of intelligent people enjoy it... I don't know any mind you but the law of averages says there must be at least one.
<Ghosties> 4Dee_Twenty: I did
<Ghosties> 4I enjoyed MW2
<prince-dari> To be honest I don't understand the quote you posted. XD
<Ghosties> 4I only play for the campaign
<rubenflonne> i liked the story
<rubenflonne> it was to short
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
<Exscalibrony> I USED to, and I'm a pretty clever pony
<Suinide> If i do, and he shows up once, somehow, someway, im gone again
<Ghosties> 4I only play it for the story
<Dashite> MW1 was great. MW2 was eh...
<Icydragon> 13Fair enough
<Exscalibrony> MW3 looks awesome
<Dee_Twenty> 0So in other words, Ghosties plays MW2 for the "plot." Bweh heh heh.
<Polarfire> Now that chat has calmed down a bit I have an idea for mods...
<prince-dari> CoD4 campaign FTW
<Dashite> lol
<Sol> I never played CoD
<Polarfire> Its pretty simple but would save time.
<Polarfire> If anybody's interested.
<Suinide> I still didnt say i was going
<Icydragon> 13Still
<Suinide> :(
<Suinide> Oh the webs we weave
<Dashite> Looking forward to BF3 over MW3 personally.
<prince-dari> Well?
<prince-dari> Today we celebrate the lack of nesslock for the Chanserv will follow.
<Dee_Twenty> 0I'll stick to Mass Effect for my shooting needs.
<prince-dari> Polarfire: What's your idea?
<Polarfire> Why not make a page that lists all the mibbit commands. Like private message, and all that other crap I can't remember right now. And all the rooms also. Requests, etc.
<Polarfire> I see people ask about them all day every day.
<rubenflonne> again getting sick of the FPS games
<rubenflonne> E3 made me cry
<rubenflonne> *nods*
<Princess_Celestia> derp
<rubenflonne> it was worse in person x3
<Dee_Twenty> 0>Implying people read FAQ's.
<RainBroDash> 10So, like a troubleshooting page? The problem with that is that people will STILL ask the same question, just having not read that page.
<Dee_Twenty> 0Wait, they allow the public into E3 now?
<Suinide> Nah i dont think i want to go back ever
<Lambda> may I ask what nesslock is?
<rubenflonne> no i used to work for konami
<Polarfire> I wouldn't. I can't remember any of the commands. haha.
<prince-dari> Half the functions don't even require them to type anything, they're built into mibbit.
<RainBroDash> 10It's like the rules. We say it's mandatory that you read them. I read them the first time I came on here. I bet at least SOME of you haven't done though
<Dee_Twenty> 0Ah, I was going to say, last I heard only the press was allowed.
<Dashite> E3 got me NHL12, Uncharted 3, BF3 and DE:HR for $20 off each title so E3 wins this year.
<Polarfire> Put it in between stream and shat.
<Polarfire> FAQ READ FOR CHAT COMMANDS in big bold letters.
<RainBroDash> 10Widen the window even more? D:
<prince-dari> You really want to know?
<RainBroDash> 10RULES is in big capslock :P
<Polarfire> or below chat.
<Lambda> and ixr, the only people who ever post at SF anymore are people that I don't think you even know
<Sol> I read them
<RainBroDash> 10Good, Sol. Have a cookie :D
<Dashite> I read them when I was bored. :/
<Ghosties> 4Yes, Dashite. I play MW for the "plot"
<Polarfire> I read them first time I came.
<rubenflonne> there where a few good demos
<Lambda> Swaffy, Clock-La, Aceedwin, Neotyguy, etc.
<rubenflonne> but damn it, no more remakes
<rubenflonne> no more sequals
*Sol noms
<rubenflonne> no more FUCKING FPS!!!
<Ghosties> 4Wait
<Lambda> dari: maybe not :P
<Ghosties> 4That was to Dee_Twenty
<Dashite> Yeah.

<Suinide> I know all of them :(
<Dashite> Also, can I get a good C&C again?
<Dee_Twenty> 0Pft, even if you made it so you had to read the FAQ every time they came to the page people would just scroll through it without reading it and click "I have read bla bla blee bla."
<Icydragon> 13Shh
<Icydragon> 13k
<Suinide> What about someone named sympony? Synthony?
<Suinide> Something like that
<RainBroDash> 10Also, there isn't exactly much to remember. you can right click to PM people. the /nick is in the rules so you should know it already, and the request room is subject to change from stream to stream
<Polarfire> Nobody leiks me idea:(
<rubenflonne> a C&C would be nice to see again
<Hogia> 7lol

<Dashite> They could call it C&C4.

<RainBroDash> 10rubenflonne, implying there's been a good C&C since Westwood stopped ruling over the creation?
<rubenflonne> but having to much fun with you bronies
<Lugia365> does drf have the mIRC for windows 7 yet?
<rubenflonne> this ist rue
<Dashite> C&C3 wasn't too bad.
<Lugia365> because I may need it
<Dee_Twenty> 0Oh I like it, I'm just saying it would only really stop people from asking the same questions over and over who would most likely google the question rather than ask it anyway.
<Lambda> well, clock-la is annoying as hell
*Hogia 7shrugs
<RainBroDash> 10ruben dude we need to play some RTS sometime buddy
<Dee_Twenty> 0Ew. Civ V.
<Suinide> No there not. But still, if i go back, ill be there for...more sentimental reasons
<Hogia> 7My elbow itches. .-.
<Dashite> RA3 suffered from the co-op focus.
<Polarfire> Well I just see people ask the same questions aaaaaalllll the time and if I was a mod I would get mad
<RainBroDash> 10Empire Earth or something xD
<Lugia365> Also, I have a new computer
<Lambda> but she's not evil or anything
<drf|laptop> 03no I don't
<rubenflonne> i enjoy civ. V
<Suinide> I have a purpose if i go there now, and im oretty sure i wouldnt be fufilled
<Polarfire> You don't have to read it, its just there for n00bs.
<Lugia365> Dang
<RainBroDash> 10Polarfire, it gets annoying, but these people are usually the ones who are a bit silly in the head. and they are also the least likely to read an FAQ. As rude as that is, it's kinda true :S
<Suinide> Im evil, you dont even want to know what ive been doing since i left...
<rubenflonne> i hated the religion because of the stupid, oh hey you going to do free religion but all of your groups are converted its rendered useless
<Suinide> Heehee...
<Suinide> Pretty*
<RainBroDash> 10n00b usually correlates with 'most likely to have problems' and 'least likely to read FAQ'
<rubenflonne> i liked the corporation though
<Polarfire> I asked a few questions that weren't answered in the FAQ.
<Dashite> Civ4 vs Civ5 is irrelevant because Alpha Centauri is still the best Civ game.
<RainBroDash> 10grats :D that's why I mean it's a general idea
<Dee_Twenty> 0Civ IV was better, Civ V feels like a step backwards instead of forwards. If you have a good idea that's poorly implemented in a game, like religion, don't just cut it out entirely, fix it.
<Ghosties> 4Civ IV is a fun game
<Lugia365> Do you at least still have the serial code for mIRC?
<rubenflonne> still need to play alpha
<Polarfire> Like requests room, prvt messaging, and how to do the /me thing.
<Ghosties> 4I just got it the other day
<Polarfire> or whatever it was. I still can't remember.
<Lambda> I won't ask
<Polarfire> SEE!
<Dashite> Civ V vanilla > Civ 4 vanilla. Civ 4 Beyond the Sword > Civ V
<Lambda> :P
<Icydragon> 13I know...
<RainBroDash> 10Polarfire, as I said requests room changes depending on which mod makes it. and also those things are things people should pick up eventually after 1 or 2 BMNs :P
<rubenflonne> lol true dash
<rubenflonne> but mod civ 5 is great
<Lambda> I assume it's along the lines of smashing small children's lego sets or something
<Dee_Twenty> 0Civ IV also had one of the greatest main menus of all time.
<Lambda> jk
<Suinide> Nah, worse
<Dashite> That too. I don't know if it's possible for them to top Baba Yetu.
<RainBroDash> 10It's just a lot of effort and one extra thing to mention in announcements and things, all for some newbs :P
<Icydragon> 13Shhhhh
<RainBroDash> 10I didn't know, I lurked until I knew :D
<Suinide> :( but im remebering even more now since ive come back icy
<Lugia365> drf?
<RainBroDash> 10granted this was 3 weeks ago, still appropriate though
<rubenflonne> i need to find a civ 5 pony mod
<Ghosties> 4Well, as much as I'd like to talk Civ with you guys, I'm gonna play "Too Many Puppies" by Primus on Audiosurf, now
<RainBroDash> 10hf Ghosties
<Dashite> Later Ghosties!
<Polarfire> mmm. yeah. I guess, but i just find it annoying that you have to lurk to gain knowledge.
<Sol> FSU, Ghosties
<Dee_Twenty> 0You need to play some pony beats on Audiosurf. <3
<Icydragon> 13Forget it all, everythings gonna be ok
<Dashite> I've been playing pony songs in Beat Hazard.
<Lambda> try to remember the good times
<Polarfire> And asking questions gets old
<Dee_Twenty> 0I bet Pinkie's Lie kicks your ass in games like them.
<Dashite> Trying to give myself seizures. I don't think there is any other reason to play Beat Hazard.
<Suinide> I dont know
<Dashite> Soo many flashing lights...
<RainBroDash> 10Polarfire most communities are like that >:3 trust me, I'd love to only cater for people who didn't ask questions, and didn't cause trouble... But then I'd be out of a job
<Lambda> like when you gave us all cookies when we bowed and we declared you the pope
<Polarfire> RainBroDash: how long have you been watching BMN?
<Lambda> hey dari
<Suinide> Heh...those were good times...
<Lambda> you know the sims?
<RainBroDash> 10 6 BMNs in a row not including tonight
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<RainBroDash> 10so 3 weeks
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/0Tjx0.jpg
<Exscalibrony> What's your favorite Civ V quote? Mine's "Build additional pylons?"
<Bronypeanut> 14Grey Text
<Lambda> made that last night
<prince-dari> LOL
<Polarfire> Wow you made it to mod quick.
<prince-dari> AWESOME
<Dashite> RainBroDash has been here less time than I have?!
<eXAKR|Alt> Light_Latias
<eXAKR|Alt> I mean
<eXAKR|Alt> Lugia365
<Suinide> But the bad...outwiegh them by a lot
<Dee_Twenty> 0I only missed the first movie night.
<Polarfire> This is my 2nd friday.
<eXAKR> I have it
<eXAKR> PM me
<RainBroDash> 10What's the implication of me being here less time than you? Just wondering guys.. Explain?
<Lugia365> kk
<Sol> I've been here about three weeks as well. Aladdin and Starship Troopers?
<Exscalibrony> I haven't missed movie night yet!
<RainBroDash> 10Yep sol. was a great night
<Icydragon> 13I forgave you so... screw the rest?
<Dee_Twenty> 0Though I slept through much of last week's.
<Bronypeanut> 13<-- Modded on the 2nd BMN
<Suinide> Yeah...
<Sol> Yes it was! I loved that night!
<Aeroslash> night all
<Hogia> 7night
<Suinide> But i stil dont want to see them
<Dashite> That was an awesome movie night.
<Suinide> I might cry
<Suinide> Or kill them
<Bronypeanut> 13That night made Starship Troopers 20% cooler
<Dee_Twenty> 0Austin Powers = Instant sleeping pill.
<Lambda> Most of the bad times were involving people who are not here anymore
<RainBroDash> 10>Bronypeanut posting after stream, with no mod duties. >not posting as flutterpeanut......
<Icydragon> 13Exactly
<Sol> What are the criteria for becoming a mod?
<Suinide> But not all?
<Bronypeanut> 13hm
<Dashite> The Mario movie was either my first or second movie night.
<Polarfire> I have way too many things that take up friday nights IRL to ever take care of any mod duties I would have.
<RainBroDash> 10@Dashite, @Polarfire. I'm still wondering why you're so astounded I've been here a short time, what gives? D:
<Bronypeanut> 13Wat
<Bronypeanut> 13OH
<Sol> Just like applying for a job?
<Lambda> well, I know I was involved in the darkcynder22 incident
<Lambda> :P
<Polarfire> Oh sorry I didn't know that was directed at me.
<Lambda> but the bad aspect of that incident is the person who's gone
<RainBroDash> 10lol'd^
<Suinide> Not her...
<Dashite> :D
<Lambda> but the things you're talking about
<Lambda> those people are all gone
<RainBroDash> 10I'm just interested, that's all >.<
<Lambda> I haven't seen them in at least a year
<rubenflonne> xD
<Flutterpeanut> 13And then I did.
<Lambda> if not longer
<Bane> Hi everyone!
<RainBroDash> 10wb peanut
<RainBroDash> 10HI BANE
<Dashite> I dunno. Most places usually have mods that have been around a little longer.
*Hogia 7sits on Cube again
<Dashite> Hey Bane!
<prince-dari> Oh, Lambda, can you watch youtube now?
<Sol> Hullo!
<Suinide> ...really?
<Lambda> I can indeed
<prince-dari> Have you seen this one yet?
<Flutterpeanut> 13What happens if I decide to ignore Prince-Dari's automatic wanring?
<Bane> I just got back from an amazing performance
*Ray yawns and sits on Hogia's head
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Ghosties> 4Sol
<RainBroDash> 10you get kicked i think
<Lambda> and yes really, for one thing I haven't even been to spyrochat in less than a year
<Flutterpeanut> 13TESTING THE THIRD WARNING
<Dee_Twenty> 0You must cross the burning desert of despair, traverse the treacherous forest of festering fear, swim the raging sea of sorrow, and retrieve from the top of mount misery the great and powerful banhammer of banality which is guarded by the dragons of DOOOOOOM! to be a mod.
<Lambda> but for another thing they are definitely not on the forum anymore
<RainBroDash> 10Ah I seeee. Well Dashite the thing is I wasn't plucked out of the group of viewers as if to say 'you're the best one RBD, you be a mod' dude
<Lambda> and DEFNITELY not here
<Polarfire> Well its just you've only been here a short time and last time I talked to you you weren't a mod and I remember you asking me for advice on what cutie mark for your character... AND NOW your all *Mod *Kick *Ban and stuff.
<Polarfire> nuff saud
<Sol> Ghosties, yes?
<Polarfire> said
<prince-dari> After the first time it kicks you it doesn't do it again.
<Flutterpeanut> 0Lolk
<Suinide> I have no friends there
<Ghosties> 4What does FSU mean?
<Lambda> I'm here every single day, and I never see anyone other than Stormy, Dari, and Aicebo
*SilverSonic sits on Ray's head :3
<Suinide> Ill be all alone
<Flutterpeanut> 13Wait really?
<Flutterpeanut> 13Oh. It doesn't.
<Sol> FSU = Fuck shit up
*Ray gets crushed
<Lambda> if you mean the forum, I'm there
<SilverSonic> ;; I'm not that big
<Lambda> Stormy's there
<Ghosties> 4Ah, thanks. I'M THE ELITE CHAMPION FOR TOO MANY PUPPIES ON AUDIOSURF :D
<Suinide> Aicebo? I forgot about her
<Lambda> Icy is sometimes there
<Flutterpeanut> 13I can't put hearts in my name
<Flutterpeanut> 13:(
*Hogia 7drops Cube on Damos
<Lugia365> lol
<Lambda> yeah, she is still around
<Icydragon> 13mmhmm
<Ray> 02yesh, you are
*Hogia 7runs
<Lambda> goes by Mikey now
<Dee_Twenty> 0I bet that's because nopony else PLAYS that song. :p
<Suinide> Icys gonna need to be there always
<Dashite> I don't think I have any elite championships left.
<rubenflonne> i need to get audio surf at some point
<Icydragon> 13Be where?
<Suinide> Spyro forums
<SilverSonic> me isnt Ray
<Ghosties> 4And Dee_Twenty: Nice alliteration in that wall o text there :P
<Lambda> The only time I ever see you Icy is in Spam
<Lambda> :P
<Dashite> I might still have the lead on Samus vs Rundas from MP3.
<Ghosties> 4Actually a few people have played Too Many Puppies
<Sol> I see you FSU'd, good on ya
<Lambda> then again, that's where I do most of my posting too
<Ghosties> 4But no one's played it on Elite yet :)
<Polarfire> Its like taking a job and being promoted a lot faster than someone who has been there longer.
<rubenflonne> x3
<Polarfire> Nothing wrong with it, its just surreral in a way.
<prince-dari> Jackie Chan so badass.
<Ghosties> 4Well, like I said, Sol, no one's played it on Elite yet :P
<Dashite> What polarfire said.
<Lambda> oh hey
<Lambda> Mikey's on right now
<Lambda> on Gmail
<Dee_Twenty> 0Alliteration always makes me merry. :p
<Lambda> not IRC though
<prince-dari> Hm.
<Ghosties> 4DAT ALLITERATION
<Polarfire> Now you could kick me if you wanted...
<Ghosties> 4AAMMM
<Polarfire> HHHHNNNNGGGGG
<RainBroDash> 10@Dashite @Polarfire, the way I applied to be a mod (and I use the word carefully ;3) is important. The stream had an open BMN European-specific mod position to mod (primarily the saturday stream). I was never 'promoted' or anything. I applied for an open position and was interviewed.
<Suinide> I dont think i want to talk to her...
<Dashite> I think part of it is that I still kinda consider myself as being new to BMN and seeing someone who's been here an even shorter period of time is just odd.
<Hogia> 7lol
<Suinide> Not gonna lie im uncomfortable now
<Suinide> Really uncomfortable
<SilverSonic> yay i has AdBlocker Plus nao
<Dashite> as a mod I mean.
<Ghosties> 4Guys, point is that RBD applied for the position and got it
<Lugia365> Same here
<Dashite> Totally understand that.
<Ghosties> 4RBD, don't divulge ANY information pertaining to the interview
<Lugia365> Plus No-Script
<Polarfire> Yeah I know I'm not critisizing you or anything dude its just surreal in a way
<Roman500> oh cool I finally finished my Deathstalker pony
<Dee_Twenty> 0I wouldn't want the job anyway. Unless the pay is good, IS the pay good? :p
<RainBroDash> 10The great thing about this is that it shows that I was picked for my ability to do good for the stream, based on an interview which showed my traits, talked about past experiences in modding, etc. I was never 'picked'... I 'made the cut' through what was a difficult process
<rubenflonne> there was a texis person in the white house
<prince-dari> Seriously, you complain a lot.
<rubenflonne> he fucked over america
<Hogia> 7That add-on annoys me.
<Suinide> Lol
<RainBroDash> 10I had to impress people, and I thought I'd get stick for it at some point, here we are : /
<prince-dari> Why are you so bothered about certain people being on?
<Suinide> ...
<Ghosties> 4RainBroDash, mod chat. Now
<Sol> It doesn't really surprise me. Becoming a mod on a chat is not the same as becoming a manager of a store
<Icydragon> 13prince-dari: Oh you have no idea
<RainBroDash> 10Roman500, link?
<RainBroDash> 10I didn't
<RainBroDash> 10did I?
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Ghosties> 4You did
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> http://zoidokl.deviantart.com/art/As-Quickly-As-Possible-V2-0-217447664
<Suinide> You dont want to know..
<Lugia365> Not me
<Ghosties> 4Don't mention ANYTHING about the interviews
<Roman500> hmmm imageshack?
<Lambda> Yo, Mikey
<Dashite> We still <3 you RainBroDash. :)
<prince-dari> I don't care.
<Suinide> No one wants or needs to know...
<Mikey> hi
<Ghosties> 4All that: the questions and what not
<SilverSonic> Thankfully i remix :D I havent laughed this new version is Space. SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE! <--- LMAO a mix of my random tweets XD\
<Roman500> I dont really use da
<RainBroDash> 10copy paste the inappropriate part
<Exscalibrony> ;p;
<Lugia365> Just allow the right script
<RainBroDash> 10sorry dude
<prince-dari> There's nothing you could say to change my opinion.
<prince-dari> You're making a big deal of nothing.
<Roman500> which means I dont know how to use it...
<RainBroDash> 10i really am, i swear none of that looked bad to me
<prince-dari> Hey Mikey.
<Ghosties> 4Seriously dude, that shit stays private
<Lambda> dari
<Dee_Twenty> 0Once again, proof of (pony) rule 34, if it exists, there is pony of it, including (regular) rule 34.
<Lambda> I'll tell you the breif summary of it
<Polarfire> Somebody should get some sleep chat is still kinda crowded
<Mikey> hey dari
<Kamina> what network Armageddon `o'
<Suinide> Its not nothing
<Ghosties> 4That's why I didn't say anything about the actual content of the interview the night before
<Dashite> But it's only 1:30am...
<Hogia> 7lolwut @SilverSonic
<Mikey> dari do you wanna see all the mlp merchandise I got last night
<Lambda> the RP group said very disturbing things to and about him once
<Ghosties> 4We don't want people to have to "study" for the applications, we want to see them as they are with no hints
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> 1:36 AM to be precise
<Lugia365> Is he new or something?
<prince-dari> Hell yes.
<Lambda> but I can't say any more than that
<Polarfire> 12 36 here :D
<Sol> We are internerds
<Icydragon> 13prince-dari: I'm somewhat part of this, and yes, it would be best if he didn't say
<prince-dari> It's the internet, people say stuff.
<prince-dari> You can't take it seriously.
<Light_Latias> 12ohai 365
<RainBroDash> 10well I get that. and I thought i'd avoided it mostly. But looking back yeah shit i guess my wording was pretty dire
<Dee_Twenty> 0Damn this Lupin torrent is taking forever.
<Sol> internerds are naturally night owls
<Lambda> no, not like that
<Polarfire> I am an internerd... but its odd bc I'm not a gamer.
<Hogia> 7ohai LL
<Lambda> they are RPers
<Lugia365> Hey LL
<Lambda> meaning when they say stuff
<Hogia> 7http://hogia.deviantart.com/#/d3lgkmz
<Polarfire> I am a night owl.
<Lambda> they did stuff
<prince-dari> Did stuff, over the internet?
<Dashite> I probably won't be on really late tonight. Too many early mornings this week.
<rubenflonne> ghost is so funny
<Exscalibrony> *Content Sigh* I love brony chatrooms
<prince-dari> In otherwords, nothing but text.
<RainBroDash> 10But on the other hand, you asked me a re-hash of the questions in the email
<Lambda> well with text, but yes
<prince-dari> other words*
<Mikey> dari http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/268668_1870244721827_1412375489_31690652_3700672_n.jpg
<Dee_Twenty> 0Three days and only the first two episodes are done.
<prince-dari> He didn't even have to read what they said.
<Lugia365> Crud, I forgot this chat's server ^^;
<RainBroDash> 10and they're the only bits that I even partially mentioned
<Sol> Internerds aren't necessarily gamers, they are just nerds of the internet :P
<prince-dari> [06:36] <prince-dari> It's the internet, people say stuff.
<prince-dari> [06:36] <prince-dari> You can't take it seriously.
<Ghosties> 4Again, we don't want anyone to know what goes on in the interviews
<Mikey> icy is pink he is feelin sassy
<Lambda> I see what you mean, but it made him really uncomfortable being here
<SilverSonic> Lugia365: i've been here since December2010 I think
<Ghosties> 4Even if they ARE just re-wordings or rehashes
<Exscalibrony> Steam chat, this one, Celestia radio. All of them, I need to go to a brony meetup one day.
<prince-dari> HOLY SHIT
<prince-dari> You serious?
<Lambda> Duuude
<Lambda> Mikey
<Lugia365> I've been on since... 2008 I believe, but just got back on
<Suinide> Dont try to assume dari, its not like that...
<Lambda> that's awesome!
<Icydragon> 13Normally I'd agree, but this is different
<Hogia> 7I've been here since September 2009
<RainBroDash> 10I know, i didnt mean it bro. it was a mistake, gah
<Mikey> and tonight I got a backpack
<prince-dari> It's just text. You don't even have to read it.
<rubenflonne> im trying to set one up for south california
<Mikey> and I tried to include in the picture but couldn't but I got rarity and rainbow dash socks
<Ghosties> 4*sigh* Just don't talk anymore about it in the main room. If someone brings up the interview, just say it's private
<Mikey> too small for me though :(
<Suinide> Its not like that...at all
<Ghosties> 4You don't have to prove yourself to anybody
<rubenflonne> maybe a brony con x3
<RainBroDash> 10yup
<RainBroDash> 10brb
<prince-dari> You make out like you're a real life rape victim or something.
<Dee_Twenty> 0Hate living in Bumfuck Nowhere, there are never any cons or anything here. T_T
<rubenflonne> well i only know 2 bronies down here
<Suinide> *sigh*
<Hogia> 7http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/demotivational-posters-history.jpg lol
<Icydragon> 13Just drop it colten
<Mikey> what's suinide on about
<Dashite> I don't know any in person.
<Icydragon> 13*sunide
<Polarfire> Yeah true but as a general rule.
<Icydragon> 13...sorry...
<Polarfire> Be careful with generalizations.
<Suinide> Nice
<prince-dari> How the hell did you get all this stuff?
<rubenflonne> i got friends though, soon they will be part of the herd x3
<Sol> That's weird, I know 5 bronies here, and 2 potential converts
<Icydragon> 13Sorry, I'm used to it...
<Armageddon> one full of noobs
<Suinide> Its fine
<rubenflonne> *pulls my puppet strings out*
<Hogia> 7what? The pic disappeared.
<Suinide> Josw
<Hogia> 7http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/demotivational-posters-history.jpg
<Suinide> Jose*
<Polarfire> Most internerds are gamers
<Dashite> :D
<Mikey> I got all the stuff last night at target
<Icydragon> 13*josy
<Mikey> and I got the backpack in hell
<Polarfire> I have 0 brony friends and 0 potential converts. I live in a barren wasteland of bony-ness.
<prince-dari> There's no merchandise in the UK. :'(
<Lambda> :(
<Mikey> yet
<Mikey> you said it just premiered there right
<Lambda> Well didn't the show just come out?
<Mikey> THE SHITSTORM IS COMING DARI
<Sol> But not all internerds are gamers, though. Internerds are internerds
<prince-dari> Yep.
<Suinide> Josy...hmhm
<Mikey> heres the backpack
<Mikey> http://avalonskynoise.tumblr.com/post/7409493823/guise-guise-look-what-i-got-today
<Caaz> Is it Purplesurge.
<Icydragon> 13;3
<prince-dari> I'm going to stick ponies to the top of the highest mountains in the UK too.
<Polarfire> yeah true
<Polarfire> I am an internerd :)
<Polarfire> But not a gamer
<D20> Damn that back button on my mouse.
<Suinide> <3
<rubenflonne> depends on what my mood is
*Bane is waiting anxiously to see what happened to RainBroDash
<rubenflonne> i got lots of friends
<rubenflonne> but all to busy irl
<rubenflonne> sadly x.x
<Dashite> At least you don't have to worry about the backspace like in Google chat.
<Armageddon> has more noobs
<Armageddon> but less trolls
<Sol> Yeah, what happened to him and Ghosties?
<Dashite> That damn docs chat is horrible.
<Polarfire> Dee_Twenty: where is bumfuck nowhere?
<SilverSonic> http://yes.thatcan.be/my/next/tweet/ If you have twitter and have a lot of tweets, endless hiariousness XD
<Polarfire> sounds like me
<Icydragon> 13Shh not yet boo
<Sol> He sounded like RBD got in trouble :<
<Suinide> Whys mot
<Suinide> Not
<Mikey> SUINIDE AND ICYDRAGON ARE L0V3R$
<Dashite> Feelsbadpony.jpg
<Polarfire> It did. I cont know what he said tho
<Icydragon> 13*rawrs*
<Dee_Twenty> Anyplace with one or fewer stoplights.
<Polarfire> that got him in trouble....
<prince-dari> Perfect.
<Suinide> *erupts*
<Polarfire> Well I have more stoplights than that but that doesn't make up for lack of bronies :(
<Dashite> I live somewhere. Woo!
<Icydragon> 13Thank you Captain Obvious, I dn't know what we'd do without you
<Icydragon> 13*don't
<Lugia365> Wow
<Dee_Twenty> You can literally blink and miss the "downtown" area if you're driving and come to a green light.
<Lugia365> mIRC fails

<Polarfire> What happened?
<Dee_Twenty> Roman500: It's a cheap ripoff of Charlotte's Web, only even MORE boring.

<Dashite> Fear is the mind killer
<Suinide> Lol
<Roman500> man
<Dee_Twenty> Nah, probably just read too much Green Lantern Corps. :p
<Dashite> Fear is the little death.
<Sol> FEAR? That game was killer
<Dashite> that brings total annihilation
<Suinide> Those who call it creepy, i call wusses
<Dashite> Dammit.
<Dashite> Obliteration, not annihilation.
<Hogia> 7lol

<Lambda> Ohhhh dari
<Suinide> Your dead
<Lambda> I think I get the ferris wheel thing

<Ghosties> 4Dashite
<prince-dari> Oh really now
<prince-dari> ?
<Ghosties> 4PM
<Lambda> is it by any chance a reference to a certain character named N?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Mikey> icy you are so all over the damn place what are you a parrotfish
<prince-dari> Ponychan meme.
<Lambda> Nevermind then
<Mikey> oh my god N on the ferris wheel he's fuckin creepy
<Icydragon> 13No, I'm a slut
<Lugia365> I believe I'm all set
<Lugia365> now*
<Suinide> A gay slut
<Dee_Twenty> For you less nerdy folks, when a Green Lantern is recruited their rings will say "(Insert name here) of (Insert home planet here). You have the ability to overcome great fear."
<Icydragon> 13Nnnnnnope
<Exscalibrony> Green Latern = Worst super gero ever.
<Exscalibrony> *hero
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<Dee_Twenty> Nah, that would be Aquaman. Green Lanterns are fucking epic.
<prince-dari> SYRUP!
<rubenflonne> making matter from thought is bad?
<prince-dari> SYRUP EVERYWHERE!
<Icydragon> 13And last I checked you're the girl here

<rubenflonne> aquaman is worse
<Suinide> Big dea
*prince-dari Wilhelm screams.
<Suinide> Deal
<rubenflonne> though i liked the muscle one
<Lambda> Mikey that was exactly what I thought dari was referencing
<Exscalibrony> I didn't say the super POWER was bad, just the weilder
<Roman500> so um RainBroDash I got a DA thing now you wanted the link?
<Mikey> yeah I got that from you lol
<rubenflonne> there are 3 earth rings

<Dee_Twenty> WHICH wielder? There's four Earth Lanterns, and the rest of the Corps from all over the universe.
<Dashite> Heh. Nice. :D
<Lugia365> Not counting collage.
<rubenflonne> oh there where four
<Roman500> first time I used a tablet lol
<rubenflonne> i thought there where three
<Dee_Twenty> You're probably forgetting Kyle.
<rubenflonne> nice job romna
<Exscalibrony> He can make literally ANYTHING... "I only have 30 seconds to save the universe! What can I make that will let me kill every enemy here!?" *Makes giant green mace* "For Equestria!!!"

<prince-dari> NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME!
<Lugia365> Alrazial Kadore!
<prince-dari> DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
<Dee_Twenty> Kyle didn't technically have a ring before since he was Ion, he was forced to give that power up to a new Ion though so now he's an honour guard with Guy.
*prince-dari cuts self
<Icydragon> 13I understand...
<Suinide> ?
<Exscalibrony> Batman is the best, no "Super-power" still beats everyone. Without killing.
<prince-dari> You understand nothing.
<Lambda> That backpack is awesome
<Lambda> I want one D:
<Mikey> when icy is alone he sings its raining men in a rain slicker in the fancy mirror in the kitchen while he makes funny brownies
<Mikey> :D
*Hogia 7is still cold
<Suinide> He makes cupcakes
<Lambda> oh yeah, Mikey I made our SF family on the Sims
<Exscalibrony> Batman + Green Latern ring = unstoppable.
<Lugia365> Turn up the heat or something
<Icydragon> 13My weed brownies are a family secret
<rubenflonne> he had a ring once
<Dee_Twenty> Guy Gardner and Bats are brilliant together, I always love the one scene when Guy moons Batman from outside the Watch Tower and spells the words "Bye bye Bats." with his ring.
<rubenflonne> but i forgot whicho ne
<rubenflonne> *one**
<Dashite> I'm gonna have to go with Stark. Robotic exoskeleton > whatever batman has.
<Exscalibrony> Man, it's too early here, keep messing up my words
<Dee_Twenty> Batman's reply? "Tell Gardner he needs a shave."
<Mikey> oh jeez
<Icydragon> 13Where are all the chicks?
<Lambda> I apologize for the clothes your character is wearing, this is the only non girly outfit available
<Hogia> 7The heater is around the corner, and the computer's here.

<Lambda> if only they'd have the option for a sweatshirt or something
<Lugia365> hey drf, you still hate deviantART?
<Mikey> in your rain slicker
<Dee_Twenty> Planet Hulk and Civil War ruined Tony Stark and Reed Richards for me, I can't stand any story about them unless it involves getting their asses kicked.
<Exscalibrony> *Generic pony-related quote here*
<Hogia> 7:o

<Icydragon> 13*shoves Suinide on the ground*
<RainBroDash> 10sure, since there's nothing streaming
<Dashite> I listen to a bit of this and a bit of that. About the only thing I really don't listen to is country.

<Exscalibrony> I like that one a lot.
<Mikey> i am totes on a sudden internet high
<Dee_Twenty> Oh, and thanks to Stark and Richards we also got One More Day, which makes Emo Parker from Spider-Man 3 seem in character.

<Mikey> that girl in the red sweater looks so awkward
<Exscalibrony> What does IE stand for anyway? In example? (Not the Internet Explorer)
<Dee_Twenty> Jedi Drinking Song is awesome.
<rubenflonne> not sure
<Lambda> She's very much insane
<Polarfire> I like a lot of older rock music. Stuff from the 60's all the way up to the 90
<Lambda> but in a good way
<Lambda> hard to explain
<Polarfire> and of course pony music
<rubenflonne> *is listening to fluttershy sing*
<Exscalibrony> Sorry if I'm spamming, the Kit-Kats just hit my bloodstream.
<Dashite> IE stands for id est
<Dee_Twenty> Which means, in English, that is.
<Polarfire> Wow I can't type at all tonight...
<Dashite> Translates as that is.
<Armageddon> lmao
<Hogia> 7Now I'm trying to stifle laughter. I'd forgotten how funny the peas were XD
<Dashite> What he said ^^
<Exscalibrony> Same here Polar

<PTS> With your penis
<Polarfire> Thanks I don't think clicking works in linux.
<Dee_Twenty> Ew Linux. (Kidding)
<rubenflonne> i use a system that has all 3 systems
<Polarfire> Its a shit ton better than windows.

<Sol> Polar, you use Linux?
<Mikey> put dat ass in the air and sing chick songs icy
<Mikey> we know you do that
<Sol> I r impress
<Mikey> quit hiding it
<Armageddon> lmaao
<Dashite> All depends on what you want to do with it. :)
<Polarfire> BUT LETS NOT START THAT SERIOUSLY GUYS
<Dee_Twenty> All three are good if you know how to maintain them.
<Polarfire> NO od debate this late puuleeeez
<Icydragon> 13I don't
<Suinide> He does...a lot...like a lot a lot a lot

<Icydragon> 13Lol remember that gay song that was on when we called last night?
<CaitSith> o.o
<Polarfire> Linuz is badass, mac is just... mac and windows is just stoopid
<Polarfire> I am virus free and will remain that way indefinitely.
<Suinide> Caps lock isnt needed all the time. *ding* the more you know
<Suinide> Yesa
<Polarfire> Plus it works great with older hardware.
<Dashite> Pfft. Only Windows let's me play my games without any extra crap. Therefore Windows > *
<Mikey> shut up suinide your name isnt g i joe it's mine
<Mikey> ass
<Sol> Linux would be too much of a hassle for me, I suck at coding
<Dee_Twenty> As am I, because I know how to properly maintain my Windows installation. :p
<Polarfire> I have centrino duo and 2.5 gig on my laptop and it flys with suse 11.4.

<Exscalibrony> New question, to keep the chat going. Favorite BGM? Cutie Mark Crusading would be mine. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOY69M6-f5I
<Dee_Twenty> It's silly when people talk about how any OS is better or worse when it comes to viruses. Really unless you're the sort of dumbass who does things like clicking on a popup that says your computer is infected viruses are a moot point.
<Lambda> I love how we're all bronies XD
*Suinide cant help but like it
<Sol> See, my GPU is so bad that I'm lucky it can play some visual novels.
<Dashite> Thou hast just received the Amish Virus. As we haveth no technology nor programming experience, this virus worketh on the honour system. Please delete all the files from thy hard drive and manually forward this virus to all on thy mailing list. We thank thee for thy cooperation.
<Polarfire> Yeah I kept my windows pretty virus free..... But wit linux I don't have to worry about any of that anymore.

<Polarfire> Yup.
<rubenflonne> awesome
<Mikey> you know it's true
<Polarfire> What distro u have?
<Exscalibrony> I like AVG, doesn't block ANYTHING, but it destroys viruses on your computer pretty well.
<rubenflonne> i forgot its been a while x3
<Polarfire> XD
<Polarfire> I don't have to worry about any virus protection...
<Dee_Twenty> I can't use AVG, the name makes me keep expecting it to shout "AAAAAAASSSSSSSS!" and blow up NES games.
<Exscalibrony> lol
<Suinide> ...maybe...

<Sol> Normal Pony doesn't get much love ;_;
<Exscalibrony> Agreed
<Ghosties> 4Applejack is a good pony
<Dee_Twenty> Applejack is second least best pony.
<Polarfire> I like AJ :(

<Bane> Pretty sweet, just saw two of my favorite artists at a concert
<Dashite> Whoa, whoa, whoa...
<Ghosties> 4Which artists?
<Dashite> Did you just put Dash at the bottom of your list?
<Applejack> > Applejack > Rainbow Dash
<Bane> SamiYam and JonWayne
*Ray goes to sleep on Hogia's head
<Dee_Twenty> Yes.
<Applejack> >Prepares ze sheild
<Ghosties> 4Never heard of them : /
<Ghosties> 4Glad you had a good time, though
<Bane> What's up with you, though
<Hogia> 7:o
<Bane> any reason you're meh, or is it just one of those nights?
<Ghosties> 4Applejack: Or, how about AJ=RD since they're both voiced by the same actress?
<Dashite> I just... I can't wrap my brain around how someone could put Dash at the bottom...
<Ghosties> 4Well, I've been in the stream for about 12 hours now
*Hogia 7struggles, then falls to the floor under Ray's weight
<Polarfire> I like twilight and AJ... then pinkie pie and rainbow dash tied for 2nd.
<Applejack> Me? Or the character? :P
<Dashite> Are you sure you didn't mean for all of those to be < instead of >
<Dashite> ?
<Ghosties> 4This has literally been my whole day, so, I'm exhausted
<Dee_Twenty> Eeenope.
<Dashite> Geez Ghosties.
<Polarfire> Dang
<Bane> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Qrr-pj74g Jonwayne

<Polarfire> Dang Seth:P
<Dashite> Apparently!
<Bane> I bet.
<Polarfire> I swear he doesnt sleep.
<Bane> It would be nice though
<Polarfire> There is no way.
<Ghosties> 4I do sleep
<Dee_Twenty> Dee_Twenty suddenly imagines Ghosties singing to the tune of It Ain't Easy Being Green.
<Ghosties> 4Just not during typical night hours
<Hogia> 7..oh.
<Bane> If there's any way I could help
<Ghosties> 4Usually by the end of the night
*Hogia 7stands up
<prince-dari> BLARG
<Dashite> Do you normally work nights or something?
<Suinide> So many urls, either expensive computer, no life, or urls saved
<Polarfire> Seth over at EQ daily. he posts every hour with the exception of a small break from 5-7 am... and apparently works.
<Applejack> Yo prefiero el potro loco mas que los otros
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02Now, Good Night~
<Ghosties> 4Dee_Twenty: Actually, I was imagining Chester from Cheetos during Family Guy "It ain't easy being cheesy"
*prince-dari head asplode
<prince-dari> URLs in history.
<Ghosties> 4Bane: Don't worry about it man, this is my job
<Applejack> Ghosties, you're Seth?
<Suinide> Same thing
<Hogia> 7night.
<Suinide> As saved
<Suinide> Sorta
<Dee_Twenty> >MFW Family Guy actually has people who watch it and I can't post a reaction image because this isn't Ponychan.
<Suinide> Kind
<Suinide> A
<Ghosties> 4Dashite: I'm here for the stream on Fridays and Saturdays; almost always pre show and post show
<Polarfire> :O
*Hogia 7runs in circles =D
<Polarfire> DUN DUN DUUUUUUNNNNNNN
<Ghosties> 4Applejack: Seth? Which Seth?
<Polarfire> Seth at EQ daily
<Dashite> Yeah, I've seen you around during and after the show. Just didn't know how long you were around before hand.
<Dee_Twenty> I assume he means Sethisto.
*Ray||ZzZzZ eeps
<Ghosties> 4Ah, him
<Applejack> The EqD Seth? Or maybe I just read Polar's post wrong
<Ghosties> 4Nope, I'm not Seth
*Ray||ZzZzZ gets dizzy
<Polarfire> No Sethisto at EQ daily
<Ghosties> 4That would be disastrous really :S
<Ghosties> 4Not Sethisto, that's what I was implying
<Polarfire> Seth is pretty cool
<Polarfire> Oh.
<Applejack> OK, sorry, I had a legit blonde moment
<Polarfire> And here I thought we had a plot twist........
<Ghosties> 4I am Ghosties; Ponychan regular, BMN mod, and namer of the Sweetie Derelle meme
<Applejack> >namer of the Sweetie Derelle meme
<Dee_Twenty> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50-oWY1pFE If Mac would actually make that phone and those aps I would pay for their overpriced, overhyped, piece of crap.
<Hogia> 7Hi :D
<Polarfire> I am Polarfire; nameless.
<Applejack> >all my manly tears
<Ghosties> 4Heh, sorry, no plot twist guys
<Polarfire> awww...
<Ghosties> 4Unless you count naming a meme a twist :D
*Hogia 7proceeds to fall in vertical circles.
<Polarfire> That's pretty cool though. Whats the meme?
<Dee_Twenty> Who would want to look at Twist's plot anyway? It's too underdeveloped.
<Applejack> I am Sol; /pony/ regular, frequent annoyance on BMN, unknown otherwise
<Polarfire> AJ van you be Sol again... XD

<prince-dari> Dee_Twenty: Wow, that video is awesome.
<Lambda> Dari, do you have that clip of Spike playing the sax?
<prince-dari> SO AWESOME
<Suinide> No rainbow dash
<Lambda> I know it's in that long video, but is there a clip of just that?
<Polarfire> I am Polarfire; nameless unless you know where to look.
<prince-dari> That's it ^
<Dee_Twenty> I am Dee Twenty, /pony/ regular and destroyer of squirrels!
<Lambda> That's awesome! There's a pony for that!
<Lambda> XD perfect
<Lambda> thanks

<Polarfire> Dari you haven't seen that commercial?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Icydragon> 13God I love that
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Sol> Here's a question, who here that visits by pony-chan uses their BMN handle?
<Dee_Twenty> I wonder if any of the other mane six names are unregistered.
<Polarfire> its Awesome!!!!
<Ghosties> 4Me
<Ghosties> 4I do
<Dee_Twenty> I do.

<Ghosties> 4I've seen Dee_Twenty quite a few times on Ponychan
<Sol> Twilight is Registered
<Lambda> yeah, that's really good
<Polarfire> Its a commercial made for the bronies :D
<Lambda> I love the dramatic anime scene where he's looking for a pen and paper
<Lambda> then the dramatic music just STOPS
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Lambda> "DEAR PRINCESS CELESTIA"
<Pinkie_Pie> So, who wants to help me make cupcakes?
<Polarfire> GAAAHHH
<Polarfire> RUN
<prince-dari> Oh, that apple style MLP advert is official
<prince-dari> I didn't even realise.
<Dashite> Uh...
<Dashite> >_>
<prince-dari> AWESOME MUCH.
<Lambda> Woah, is it for the show or is there actually a pony app?
<Pinkie> Pinkie isn't take :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Nor Pinkie_Pie.
<Suinide> Theres a pony app
<SilverSonic> xD
<Suinide> I has it
<Icydragon> 13Oh fuck yeah
<Rainbow_Dash> WOW
<Polarfire> Ahhh chat has gotten down th where I like it :)
<Rainbow_Dash> Rainbow_Dash is not taken
<Rainbow_Dash> That surprises me
<Polarfire> nice and reasonable :)
<Dashite> How has Rainbow_Dash not been taken?
<prince-dari> That advert is almost as awesome as the MLP billboard.
<Dee_Twenty> Rainbow apparently is though.
<Lambda> That billboard...
<prince-dari> >Other ponies "SRS BIZNIZ YO!"
<Lambda> hrgrgrgrg
<Lambda> I want that IN my neighborhoos
<prince-dari> >Pinkie Pie "CUPCAKES! :D"
<Lambda> *Neigh-bor-hoove
<Applebloom> I would be so disappoint if THIS were taken before Pinkie_Pie or Rainbow_Dash.
<Polarfire> so many different names
<prince-dari> Lol Lambda.
<Sol> So far, Applejack, Rainbow_Dash, and Pinkie_Pie aren't taken
<Polarfire> time check. 1:45 here?
<Hogia> 7LOL WTF http://chzgifs.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/meanwhileinfinlandp1.gif
<Sol> It won't even let me change it to Rarity, it kicks me out of mibbit if I do that
<Dashite> 2:46
<fluttershy> :3
<Luna> LUNA IS FREE
<Luna> OMG
<Dashite> Sol as Luna. :D
<fluttershy> xD
<Dashite> That amuses me more than it should.
<Polarfire> hope I didn't forget anything I have to do tomorrow.
<fluttershy> um...can you please...um you know...go back to the moon
<fluttershy> i mean if you want to
<Dashite> Fluttershy would never say that...
<Luna> .... I'm so sorry! I missed you big sister?
<Dee_Twenty> Indeed, she would say "You're... going to LOVE ME!" instead.
<Polarfire> Oh lawd RPing giez srsly? DDDDD:
<Luna> You'd think with as much Luna love as there apparently is that it'd be one of the first names to be taken
<Dee_Twenty> Oh gods, Nightmare Fluttershy.
<Guest8065233> hmm
<Nightmare_Moon> BWAHAHAHAHAHA
<Guest8065233> how did i change my name xD
<Nightmare_Moon> THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER
<Polarfire> OK guys game idea.
<Nightmare_Fluttershy> YOU WILL LOVE ME FOREVER OR FACE MY WRATH! Um... if it's not too much trouble...
<Polarfire> 2 people pick characters to RP. then go for 2 mins solid while everyone watches then comments later.
<Nightmare_Moon> The phrase "Luna is now known as Nightmare_Moon" amuses me more than it should XD
<Polarfire> Anybody?
<Dashite> :D
<prince-dari> I'm still thinking that in terms of epic the "MLP FIM FanFic" video is most epic.
<Dashite> Fluttershy: ...
<prince-dari> The Cupcakes Movie Trailer is pretty close behind.
<Dashite> For the next two minutes.
<Polarfire> Well crap I'm just a barren wasteland for ideas today :(
<prince-dari> I mean epic as in spine-tingling here by the way.
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> I'd go with the cupcakes one then
<Polarfire> Nobody else wants to play? I don't wanna go first
<Lambda> but all the movie trailers with ponies I've seen were pretty gpood
<Dashite> I'm no good at emulating existing characters. :/
<Lambda> I'm mad
<Lambda> I wanted to make a Serenity MLP trailer
<Lambda> then last friday
<Lambda> someone beats me to it
<Polarfire> But you gotta stay in character and have a REAL conversation... or whatever you want it to be.
<Polarfire> for 2 minutes.
<Lambda> it's pretty awesome though
<Polarfire> Lets see how funny we can make it?
<Nightmare_Moon> I'm in, I guess
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P3HHpf-fZY <- that could've been me
<Nightmare_Moon> IDk, how2NMM well though
<Nightmare_Moon> :<
<Polarfire> So that makes 3 out of 16 XD
<Polarfire> come on mods!!
<Kinky_Pie> Kinky Pie climbs up on the nearest table in a saloon girl outfit. "We may be divided, but of you all I beg, to remember we're all hooved at the end of each leeeg! No matter what the issue, come from where ever you please! All this fighting gets you nothing, but hoof in mouth disease!"

<Polarfire> bye bye dashite
<Dee_Twenty> I never got that phrase, if the king is already dead isn't it a bit late to be hoping he has a long life?

<Polarfire> So wants to play? rules are 2 people pick characters and stay in character while talking or doing something for 2 minutes...
<Polarfire> And only they chat.
<Polarfire> Lets see how funny we can make it?
<Lambda> I think it's your colors
<Polarfire> Nobody?
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Polarfire> Well lets atleast talk or something

<Sol> 3 o' clock, bed time
<Sol> Night Polarfire
<Polarfire> Well I guess I'm out then. Just when it got reasonable... I like it when there's only a few people left because you can carry on legit conversation.

<Dee_Twenty> Pft, silly day creatures, sleeping through Luna's gift.
<Polarfire> Dee_Twenty, tell me about yourself.
<Polarfire> I want to know you.
<Sol> Huh, I didn't know I used Bellsouth. Well, I'll leave now
<Polarfire> Bye bye
<Seth> Good night
<Polarfire> night!
<Dee_Twenty> I like pickles?
<Polarfire> What music do you listen too? What are you like IRL? I want somebody to talk to at 2 in the AM.
<Polarfire> Enlighten me
<Icy> Weird, I was just watching that
<Bane> 0Well I'm off, good night everyone!
<Polarfire> Night :(
<Dee_Twenty> Pretty much whatever sounds good, and anti-social.
<Polarfire> bye bane
<Polarfire> that's interesting. how many good RL friends do you have?
<Dee_Twenty> Currently? Carry the two... None.
<Polarfire> :( that makes me sad
<prince-dari> Wait, it's "mother hubbard"?
<Polarfire> I have about.. 4 or so that I talk to...
<prince-dari> I thought it was "mother hoover". XD
<prince-dari> Thought the voiceover must have been done by the guy who made the video, hahaha.
<Polarfire> But none that really are what I would call lifetime friends.
<Dee_Twenty> Not me, I find the notion that physical proximity is important in any non-romantic relationship antiquated at best.
<Polarfire> Woah man.
<sotha> Where exactly does the antiquated fit into that sentence? Could you elucidate?
<Polarfire> Yeah I don't get.
<Polarfire> Is Dari asleep :P
<prince-dari> Never.
<Polarfire> Or lurking..
<Polarfire> yep.
<prince-dari> :P
<Polarfire> Are you from the UK?
<prince-dari> Yep.
<Polarfire> What time is it there?
<prince-dari> 8 am
<Dee_Twenty> Outdated, no longer relevant. In the modern age one is easily capable of keeping in contact between cell phones and computers without having to be in the same country let alone room.
<Polarfire> Woah so you're just starting your day. That's cool. It's waaaay past bedtime here.
<Elision> oh hey it's dari
<Elision> apparently I'm you dari
<prince-dari> Hahaha, who said that? XD
<Icy> mmmm
<Elision> everyone
<Dee_Twenty> If anything you're more likely to get a better idea of a person's real personality online than you are in person.
<Elision> I have SUPER LURKING POWERS
<Polarfire> Can I post in color?
<Polarfire> And I agree with D20
<Polarfire> about the personality thing.
<prince-dari> Ah right, haha, that makes sense.
<prince-dari> Fine.
<prince-dari> Since I'm the only mod on, you guys can post colours.
<Dee_Twenty> Most people are far more willing to admit to things online behind the curtain of anonymity than they are in person.
<Polarfire> 12I CHOOSE BLUE
<Polarfire> 12Thanks
<sotha> That is so difficult to read
<sotha> Too dark
<Polarfire> 12And D20 you are right. Online people don't have anything to hide from others.
<sotha> Choose a lighter shade please?
<Polarfire> 11Light blue?
<sotha> much better thank you
<Polarfire> 11ok.
<Elision> 9this is so much of a pain for me!

<Dee_Twenty> 1313All you have to do is take a cup of flower add it to the mix! Now just take a little something sweet no sour, a bit of salt just a pinch! Baking these treats is such a cinch ad a teaspoon of vanilla! Add a little more and you count to four and you never get your fill of... cupcakes! So sweet and tasty! Cupcakes! Don't be too hasty!
<Polarfire> 11bump
<Polarfire> 11Just a Dash?
<prince-dari> What's gay.pl?
<Elision> 9cupcakes?
<Dee_Twenty> 1313That doesn't look like esperanto.
<Elision> 9it's an infamous irssi script but you're on mirc
<sotha> 7I had the most amazing cupcakes last weewk!
<Elision> 9it lets you do stuff like rainbow text and giant block letters of ascii art
<Polarfire> 11Seriously lets not talk about cupcakes.
<Dee_Twenty> 13 13Does danske arbejde?
<Polarfire> 11Its like a party up in hurr
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Dee_Twenty> 13 13Yes, ja det gør.
<Polarfire> 11with all the colors
<Dee_Twenty> 13 13All du skal gøre er at tage en kop blomst føje det til mix! Nu skal du blot tage lidt noget sødt ingen sure, en smule salt bare en knivspids! Bagning disse godbidder er sådan en cinch ad en teskefuld vanille! Tilsæt lidt mere, og du tælle til fire, og du aldrig få nok af ... cupcakes! Så søde og velsmagende! Cupcakes! Må ikke være alt for forhastet!
<Polarfire> 11herp derp
<Dee_Twenty> 13Apparently there is no Danish word for cupcakes.
<sotha> 7Well, they were cupcakes made from banana bread with just light vanilla frosting. I would have never thought of using banana bread.
<Elision> 9http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/images/1/17/Insub.jpg
<Polarfire> 11I had bananna pudding the other day.... Thought it would be gross but it was amazing.
<prince-dari> On holiday I had a lot of things I'd never had before.
<Dee_Twenty> 13I love banana puddin' with Nilla Wafers.
<prince-dari> Banana strudel, blueberry crumble.
<prince-dari> They had foods from all sorts of different countries.
<prince-dari> It was really good.
<prince-dari> Turning off the rainbow text now. XD
<Polarfire> 11Where did you go on.... wait for it... HOLIDAY!!!
<Dee_Twenty> 13You Brits are weird, calling vacations holidays.
<prince-dari> St Lucia. (:
<Polarfire> 11Pinkie pie face*
<prince-dari> You Americans are weird, calling holidays 'vacations'. :P
<Polarfire> 11I love british ppl
<Polarfire> 11Are you like us pretty much?
<Dee_Twenty> 13Actually vacation makes more sense, since the etymology of holiday is holy day.
<Polarfire> 11Dari?
<prince-dari> What do you mean?
<Dee_Twenty> 13Insane.
<Polarfire> 11Are you like us? like.... I'm not sure how to say it... Are you like us XD
<prince-dari> Also, UK English came before American English, so that's the technically correct version. :P
<Polarfire> 11foo
<Polarfire> 11:P
<prince-dari> I dunno, America seems quite different from the UK.
<prince-dari> We get a lot of things from America a while after they've had it.
<Dee_Twenty> 13We have better food, for example.
<Polarfire> 11Are you guys in a shit ton of debt too?
<Polarfire> 11What do you mean? like movies?
<Dee_Twenty> 13Cajun food>Any non-Italian European food, and most Asian foods too. <3
<prince-dari> Movies, things like trick-or-treating (which I've never taken part in :P), food, stuff in language.
<Polarfire> 11Ah.
<prince-dari> Halloween being a holiday here comes from America (though I don't treat it as such XD).
<Polarfire> 11I see.
<Polarfire> 11U guys watch the shuttle launch?
<Dee_Twenty> 13And they call jelly jam, even though jelly is completely different from jam.
<prince-dari> Is this recent news?
<Polarfire> 11today
<prince-dari> Nope then.
<Polarfire> 11the last nasa shuttle took off from FL.
<prince-dari> Lawl, you guys have jelly and jam the wrong way round.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Don't watch the news, waste of time.
<Polarfire> 11I hate the news but that was something I wanted to see.
<prince-dari> Jelly - as in gelatin, that stuff that jiggles around on a plate. :P
<Dee_Twenty> 13Nuh uh, you call gelatin jelly, and you call both jelly and jam jam.
<Polarfire> 11It went 3200 mph!! :O
<prince-dari> No we don't.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Jelly doesn't go on a plate, it goes on a sandwich.
<prince-dari> Jelly = http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/images/pe/personalised-jelly-mould.jpg
<Polarfire> 11U guys play an instrument?
<prince-dari> Jam = http://images.mylot.com/userImages/images/postphotos/2353112.jpg
<Polarfire> 11I play the piano
<Polarfire> 11and try to sing miserably
<Polarfire> 11XD
<Dee_Twenty> 13http://home.gwi.net/~spectrum/pbandj/pbj.jpg = Real jelly.
<sotha> 7I play clarinet, bass clarinet, tenor saxophone, and bassoon. And I am currently teaching myself flute and trumpet.
<prince-dari> How is that jelly? It's not a gelatin food.
<Polarfire> 11JELLY JAM IT DOESNT MATTER!!!!!!!
<sotha> 7But I am a horrible singer.
<Polarfire> 11I pretend I can match pitch but I cant.
<Dee_Twenty> 13It's not supposed to be gelatin, gelatin is gelatin.
<Polarfire> 11but I can try :D
<prince-dari> Jelly = a gelatin dessert.
<Polarfire> 11but hey sotha that's pretty cool. I mess with guitar also.
<Polarfire> 11I play both by ear I can't read music.
<sotha> 7Sotha can't play stringed instruments at all either! c:
<sotha> 7I can only read music. /can't improvise or play by ear. :F
<Dee_Twenty> 13Jelly = fruit juice and pectin creating a clear fruit spread. Jam = similar but contains both juice and pieces of fruit flesh.
<sotha> 7I hope to become better at improv though, considering how much I love jazz.
<Polarfire> 11I pure improv everything pretty much. AND OMG GUYS!!! IT DOESN't MATTER!
<prince-dari> Our definition of jelly and jam came before yours, in UK English ours is right. :P
<Polarfire> 11GAAAHHH
<sotha> 7I prefer preserves.
<Polarfire> 11DO YOU TOO BLANK FLANKS PLAY SOMETHING
*sotha 7will be back?
<Polarfire> 11*2
<sotha> 7Why are they blank flanks?
<Polarfire> 11Cause they're arguing over nothing... Idk...
<Polarfire> 11I wanna know if they play anything.
<Dee_Twenty> 13I play video games.
<sotha> 7Or is it just a naive derogative?
<prince-dari> I just don't like it when people tell me that UK English is wrong, at most you can say American English is equally right as UK English, but saying that UK English is wrong just makes no sense.
<Polarfire> 11I need to post a vid of me playing piano on youtube
<Polarfire> 11UK AND AMERICAN ENGLISH IS RIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER!!
<Polarfire> 11Dari do you play anything?
<prince-dari> I wish I did, but nope.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Your English is USUALLY correct, you're just silly about certain things like calling gelatin jelly and jelly jam. :p
<Polarfire> 11You guys need to learn something.
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> You can't call the original wrong.
<prince-dari> Your version of the language is based on it.
<Polarfire> 11I can play this:
<Polarfire> 11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgZsGLlS1g
<Dee_Twenty> 13I can call it silly though. :p
<prince-dari> Why is it silly...?
<Dee_Twenty> 13Because you have no way to differentiate between a jam and a jelly.
<prince-dari> Yes we do...
<Polarfire> 11ugh
<prince-dari> I told you.
<Polarfire> 11chat IS dead
<Polarfire> 11pretty much
<Polarfire> 11Oh well.
<prince-dari> Jelly means this:
<prince-dari> And only that.
<prince-dari> Nothing else.
<prince-dari> That's all jelly means.
<Dee_Twenty> 13You call them both jam, so how am I supposed to ask if a store carries jelly when they'd point me to the gelatin instead?
<prince-dari> We don't.
<prince-dari> They aren't both jam.
<Polarfire> 11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6z3WXuzXXc
<Polarfire> 11OMFG GUYS!!!!!!!
<prince-dari> The picture I posted before is jelly.
<prince-dari> Just jelly.
<prince-dari> Not jam.
<prince-dari> What you spread on toast is jam.
<prince-dari> Not jelly.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Exactly, you call gelatin jelly instead of calling jelly jelly, you call jelly jam.
<prince-dari> Just jam.
<prince-dari> We call gelatin gelatin?
<Dee_Twenty> 13There's no way to differentiate jam, which is a form of preserve, from jelly, which is made with fruit juice and pectin.
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> They are completely different words.
<prince-dari> They mean completely different things.
<prince-dari> They have nothing to do with each other.
<Polarfire> 11I can also play this
<Dee_Twenty> 13Indeed, just like they're completely different products.
<Polarfire> 11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXUT9U8q2YM
<prince-dari> They are completely different products.
<Polarfire> 11Sotha u there still?
<prince-dari> So how can you not distinguish between them?
<prince-dari> They have two separate completely unrelated not linked words.
<prince-dari> Jam - http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_UIXOn06Pz70/SGaJFpoeJXI/AAAAAAAADsA/uE-FJbHUa7o/s800/Strawberry+and+Rhubarb+Jam+500.jpg
<prince-dari> Jelly - http://www.jellybean88.com/wp-content/uploads/15_5_orig.jpg
<prince-dari> It's that simple.
<prince-dari> Those words are exclusive.
<prince-dari> They aren't used for anything else.
<Dee_Twenty> 13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jelly
<prince-dari> That's the page for the American version of the word, what's your point?
<prince-dari> American jelly = UK jam. American jam = UK jelly.
<prince-dari> So what?
<Polarfire> 11Night I guess guys.
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Drake> 04o-o
<Polarfire> 11Next friday I guess
<Dee_Twenty> 13American Jam = UK Jam American Jelly = Still called jam in the UK.
<Polarfire> 11Is there anyone here on weekdays?
<prince-dari> American jam = UK jam - WRONG
<Polarfire> 11...
<Dee_Twenty> 13Describe jam then, made with fruit pieces, yes?
<Polarfire> 0Night D20 and Dari
<prince-dari> Night.
<Dee_Twenty> 13That's still called jam here, or sometimes preserves.
<prince-dari> Wait, you guys have two words for the same thing?
<marc199706> lol
<prince-dari> UK jelly = jell-o in America.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Jam and preserves are sometimes used interchangably, but some people differentiate them by saying a preserve is a cooked and gelled WHOLE fruit or vegetable.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Both contain actual pieces of fruit however.
<prince-dari> I don't think you understand what jam and jelly mean in English.
<prince-dari> UK English*
<Dee_Twenty> 13Jelly by contrast only contains fruit JUICE and is solidified with pectin.
<prince-dari> You eat jam with toast, jelly with a spoon.
<prince-dari> 'nuff said.
<Dee_Twenty> 13You eat BOTH on toast in America.
<sotha> 7I agree with Ponyfire. Is this like a more regular chat thing where people are here on the weekdays too? Or is the only activity around the time when the broadcast is online?
<Dee_Twenty> 13I think some people chat here during the rest of the week, I only show up for the movie nights though.
<prince-dari> Generally it's just mods and maybe a couple of lurkers at times other than streams.
<lighty> Morning all
<prince-dari> That is what jelly is in the UK.
<Dee_Twenty> 13And I understand how both words are used in the UK, that's the problem, I can't go into a store in the UK and ask if they have any jelly in stock because they'd point me in the direction of the gelatin, I have to ask for jam instead.
<prince-dari> What jam is in the US I have no idea.
<junh1024-XD> ih
<Dee_Twenty> 13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jam Jam is jam.
<prince-dari> That's the whole point.
<prince-dari> If you ask them for jelly, they'd point you to jelly.
<prince-dari> Gelatin desserts.
<Dee_Twenty> 13But that's not what I want, I want jelly, not gelatin.
<prince-dari> If you ask them for jam, they'd point you to jam.
<SilverSonic> !kickme
<SilverSonic> XD
<prince-dari> So you ask for jam.
<SilverSonic> i was/bored
<prince-dari> Not jelly.
<prince-dari> If you want jelly, you ask for jelly.
<prince-dari> If you want jam you ask for jam.
<lighty> Orly now?
<prince-dari> How can you not understand that?
<Dee_Twenty> 13I don't want jam though, I want jelly, no fruit pieces, just gelled fruit JUICE.
<prince-dari> I don't know what you mean now.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Read the listings in the preserves wiki for both jam and jelly, they're completely different.
<sotha> 7Good night as well.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Jam contains both fruit juice and pieces of the fruit's (or vegetable's) flesh,[12] although some cookbooks define jam as cooked and gelled fruit (or vegetable) purees.[13] Properly, the term jam refers to a product made with whole fruit, cut into pieces or crushed. The fruit is heated with water and sugar to activate the pectin in the fruit.
<Dee_Twenty> 13The mixture is then put into containers. The following extract from a US cookbook describes the process.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Jelly is a clear or translucent fruit spread made from sweetened fruit (or vegetable) juice and set using naturally occurring pectin. Additional pectin may be added where the original fruit does not supply enough, for example with grapes.[12] Jelly can be made from sweet, savory or hot ingredients.
<Dee_Twenty> 13It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the additional step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or stockinette "jelly bag" is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining proce
<Dee_Twenty> 13It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised.
<Dee_Twenty> 13See? Two completely different things, but there's no word to differentiate the two in the UK, they're both called jam.
<prince-dari> I don't think you can buy American "jelly" in the UK.
<prince-dari> We just have jam.
<Dee_Twenty> 13...That is horrible, you should rebel against your rulers for depriving you of the wonderfulness of jelly.
<prince-dari> It's disgusting.
<prince-dari> What's the point of it without the fruit?
<prince-dari> The fruit is the whole point of jam.
<Dee_Twenty> 13You get a completely different texture and taste.
<prince-dari> "Jam is whole fruit cooked in sugar until the flesh is soft. Jelly is fruit juice cooked with pectin or gelatin until it congeals.
<prince-dari> Read more: http://wiki.answers.com/Q/In_British_English_what_is_the_difference_between_jam_and_jelly#ixzz1RaoDrqgm
<prince-dari> "
<Hogia> 7Ooh, activity. *shot*
<Dee_Twenty> 13It's like the difference between a good steak and a hamburger.
<lighty> Ohai hogia
<Dee_Twenty> 13They're both beef, and they both taste good, but they don't taste the same and have very different textures.
<Hogia> 7:D
<prince-dari> Wait a second.
<lighty> Wb ray
<prince-dari> The American jelly and jello are the same thing.
<Hogia> 7RAY :D
<Armageddon> going out for dinner, bbl
<SilverSonic> Lol Ray's still asleep XD
<lighty> Bouncer xD
<Dee_Twenty> 13No no no, jello is made with gelatin and is eaten as a desert, jello is what you call jelly. Jelly is a spread and is made with pectin.
<SilverSonic> Nou
<SilverSonic> He leaves his IRC on at night
<Hogia> 7brb, dinner.
<SilverSonic> like me~
<SilverSonic> and kk
<lighty> Lol, timezones
<lighty> Hogia off to dinner, and i even hadnt breakfast
<Dee_Twenty> 13To be accurate Jell-O is a specific BRAND of gelatin, but it's come to be used to describe ALL gelatin regardless of brand, much like Xerox is often used to refer to any copying machine even if it's not made by Xerox.
<prince-dari> Well if you want to you can just buy jam without fruit pieces.
<Dee_Twenty> 13That's what we'd call jelly.
<Hogia> 7back
<Hogia> 7lol
<prince-dari> Jello is essentially a type of jelly.
<lighty> Wb
<Hogia> 7shiz, is that the fastest I've ever had dinner? O_o
<Dee_Twenty> 13Precisely.
<Dee_Twenty> 13And jelly, in the US, is apparently what YOU would call jam without the fruit pieces.
<lighty> I believe so
<lighty> 4 mins?
<Hogia> 7 3 minutes.
<lighty> Right
<Hogia> 7o.o
<Dee_Twenty> 13Our method is far more efficient, jelly is much faster to say than "jam without the fruit pieces."
<prince-dari> Because your "jelly" isn't big in the UK, no one would ever look specifically for jam without fruit pieces.
<prince-dari> No one really cares.
<Hogia> 7I'm known for eating slowly. XD
<prince-dari> They just want jam.
<rubenflonne> apparently they had a C&C4
<Dee_Twenty> 13I want both, just depends on what I'm in the mood for on my sandwich.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Never got into Command and Conquer, I always preferred Age of Empires for RTS games.
<prince-dari> Also, looking at pictures of jelly, I see no discenable difference from jam.

<lighty> Its fun
<Dee_Twenty> 13It's the lack of actual fruit pieces, it makes a huge difference in texture and taste.
<lighty> Believe me xD
<Hogia> 7It's hard D:
<prince-dari> I've had jam without bits of fruit in it before.
<Dee_Twenty> 13Jam tends to be a bit stronger tasting and chunky.
<lighty> Ikr?
<rubenflonne> lol fallout 3 is 10 bucks
<lighty> Heh
<lighty> Gimp
<Dee_Twenty> 13Jelly is more subdued so you can taste more of the peanut butter.
<lighty> I use PainToolSAI
<prince-dari> We don't eat it with peanut butter.
<lighty> Easier, but also glitchy when you don't know how to setupbeverything
<rubenflonne> i enjoy peanut butter only
<Dee_Twenty> 13You have my deepest condolences.
<rubenflonne> sometimes jelly but its more peanut butter for me
<Dee_Twenty> 13Now I want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, what flavours do we have in the house at the moment?
<Dee_Twenty> 13Ooh, I hope we have some blackberry jelly left, it's my favourite, it or apple.
<Hogia|GIMP> 7lol
<rubenflonne> im either blue or grape
<Dee_Twenty> 13I've never liked blueberries that much, I like them in muffins or pancakes but that's it.
<prince-dari> I'm pretty much sure you don't get grape jam here.
<junh1024-XD> I herd SAI is what japanese artists use on pixiv
<rubenflonne> grape jam where
<lighty> Possible
<lighty> I use it for everything with art
<Dee_Twenty> 13o_o Ruben, remind me to see what kind of support Ivan needs to lead a rebellion against their rulers, they need to know the glory that is grape jelly.
<Hogia|GIMP> 7dear god my progress is terrible
<rubenflonne> ah right x3
<Drake> 04aaaaaaaah
<rubenflonne> i hope we can also get game going tomorrow
<Drake> 04this sucks
<Hogia|GIMP> 7mouse = worst drawing tool in the history of mankind
<rubenflonne> i really really want to leave the ponyvillie area
<rubenflonne> i know its ponyvillie but i want to start your parties real adventure
<lighty> I use only the mouse
<lighty> And see what i draw
<rubenflonne> outside of canterlot borders
<rubenflonne> but celestria is god so you can't get away from her xD
<Hogia|GIMP> 7link please
<lighty> Let me try thisbon the
<lighty> IPad....
<lighty> Http://www.light-umbreon.deviantart.com
<Dee_Twenty> 13And more importantly I still have a lot more yo' mama jokes to tell the princesses. X3
<Hogia|GIMP> 7Not bad for a mouse.
<lighty> I know
<rubenflonne> your character loves the abuse
<lighty> Practice makes perfect
<Dee_Twenty> 13Just a bit. :p
<rubenflonne> don't worry luna will not nuke you just yet
<rubenflonne> you did that to yourself
<lighty> And lining tools too
<Dee_Twenty> 13I almost wish it had been in Ponyville. XD
<rubenflonne> nah by the celestria would be ripping you to peices
<rubenflonne> then**
<rubenflonne> before you could even release it
<Hogia|GIMP> 7wb
<lighty> Yep.....
<lighty> Thanks
<lighty> That was the wrong button
<rubenflonne> she may be a pacifist but attack something of her kind, or her subjects your dealing with her
<Dee_Twenty> 13Totally worth it to nuke Snips and Snails.
<rubenflonne> well of course
<Hogia|GIMP> 7by the way, I think I'm going to have 'Hogia' as just a species name. I'll nickname the one that I am "Lex", because of lexicology and my vocabulary etc
<lighty> Hm
<lighty> Sounds good
<lighty> Because ive more forms, lightumbreon, lightlugia, etc.
<Hogia|GIMP> 7Cool. :3
<lighty> And just one universal name is enough, like Lighty
<Dee_Twenty> Fucking hate that back button on my mouse.
<rubenflonne> lol
<Dee_Twenty> It's great on sites like Ponychan, but I'm always accidentally hitting it here.
<rubenflonne> to skype
<Hogia|GIMP> 7lol
<lighty> How is it going?
<Hogia|GIMP> 7Good so far. I have to zoom in for any decent lines.
<Hogia|GIMP> 7I'm a perfectionist. :\
<lighty> I see....
<Hogia|GIMP> 7For most people, drawing Portal-related stuff with a mouse would be a complete failure without being tried.
<Hogia|GIMP> 7To be blunt.
<lighty> Agreed xD
<Hogia|GIMP> 7But, I'm trying~
<lighty> Good
<lighty> Cant never do enough then your best
<lighty> So try your best :3

<Dermathil> *has_the_goddarn_Gokaiger_theme_in_head*
<Dermathil> so, did you guys/gals see the new Hub commercial on EqD yet?
<TurniBrony> Nope. Almost never visit EqD
<Dermathil> eh
<EspyLacopa> Quiet morning is quiet.
<Dermathil> the new advertisement is a parody of the iPhone "There's an app for that" ads
<Dermathil> and they are BRILLIANT
<Dermathil> need a link to it?
<EspyLacopa> There's a pony for that.
<Dermathil> hehehe
<EspyLacopa> Let's go kaiger?
<Dermathil> they even got a MLG parody hidden among the app icons
<EspyLacopa> Wikiponia, Equicurious. . .
<Dermathil> I wonder if there'll be a black sentai in that show.
<EspyLacopa> EPR: Pony Radio
<EspyLacopa> heh. Angry Birds becomes Angry Mare.
<Dermathil> Rarity's secret... (in list of possible choices - Derriere (french for BUTT))
<EspyLacopa> Flutter shutter?
<Dermathil> the camera
<EspyLacopa> Hay Ninja!
<Dermathil> hehehe
<EspyLacopa> Did you pause the video to read the PNN article on Cutie Marks?
<EspyLacopa> Going through my backlog of anime before I start watching more Gokaiger.
<Dermathil> I got a tab open with a list of the frames in it.
<Dermathil> (well, the important ones)
<Dermathil> so yeah I read the entire thing.
<Dermathil> Personally I think it means that there'll probably be a season 3 and four.
<EspyLacopa> I saw Zecora during the add.
<EspyLacopa> *ad
<Dermathil> yeah. Best Pony wants you to drink potion.
<Dermathil> I find that Zecora don't have enough love. She's appeared in more episodes than trixie!
<EspyLacopa> Nature's remedies?
<Dermathil> I think
<EspyLacopa> I think she only appeared in the one episode, but they've talked about her in a few others.
<Dermathil> no, she's also in Swarm of the Century
<Dermathil> for less than a minute, but she's there.
<Dermathil> (she says "You're doomed!" as her last sentence in the episode)
<Dermathil> oh wow, I gotta get back to writing my fic...
<EspyLacopa> Fanfic: A day in the life of Zecora?
<EspyLacopa> She does live in the everfree forest after all.
<EspyLacopa> Maybe she's friends with Steven Magnet.
<Dermathil> the forest is so large, I'd be surprised if two creatures that appears in two different episodes ever met.
<EspyLacopa> Depends on where in the forest they live.
<EspyLacopa> It's never really mentioned.
<Dermathil> yeah
<EspyLacopa> And a fanfic centered on Zecora that also has random appearance of Steven Magnet?

<SirSprinkles> 6...yes.
<SirSprinkles> 6...my level of want...depends.
<NewManiac> Gummy could take over the whole damned world if he wanted.

<HuffytheMagicDragon> yo what would colts call a cutie mark? it isn't masculine at all (No offense)
<Dave_BroZilla> But yeah, this link has individual torrents for each episode, just scroll to bottom and open the collapsible list

<Aponymous> 0They call it a Cutie Mark 'cause they don't give a fuck.
<NewManiac> A coltie mark?
<Ziltoid> Nope

<Metal_Link> Anyone in here?
<NewManiac> Did we already listen to Avast FLuttershy's Ass?
<Elky> yup
<Darky> 06heya Ray :3
<HuffytheMagicDragon> ass
<Dave_BroZilla> yarp
<dance1212> eeyup
<Dave_BroZilla> Doesn't mean we can't do Avast Applejack's Ass
<HuffytheMagicDragon> ass
<Elky> true
<Bjornfot> Mr. Mod-favourite is in da house!
<Metal_Link> Because I have been coming in here for that "interview" and no one is ever in here when I come in.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh look, NOW Metal_Link shows up.
<Aponymous> 0I missed Avast Fluttershy's Ass? I sad now.
<NewManiac> Sad I missed it. I learned most of Avast Fluttershy's Ass on piano.
<Ziltoid> but fluttershy is so much better
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i'm pretty sure no ones in here
<Ray> 02Hiya~
<Ray> 02:3c
<SirSprinkles> 6...what are you talking about Metal?
<SirSprinkles> 6We've always been waiting for you?
<Dave_BroZilla> Yes, but at least we get to play a version of Avast Your Ass in general
<HuffytheMagicDragon> NAWT
<Dave_BroZilla> Stupidly catchy song
<RainBroDash> 10so who wasn't around last night when we had a bit of a problem late last night, specifically concerning myself and some viewers who deemed it appropriate to question my legitimacy as a mod?
<NewManiac> So, I was in a car for 6 hours so I started reading Fallout: Equestria. I've nearly finished chapter 3. I have to say. Pretty awesome.
<Metal_Link> What SirSprinkles?
<Hipster_Brony> i dont think i was
<HuffytheMagicDragon> luv MEEEE
<Ziltoid> oh yeah
<Hipster_Brony> explain it to me
*SirSprinkles 6wasn't here
<JetTheLatios1> yay i got pinged again D:
<DarkenedPath> i have this on my music playlist on Yuotube
<RainBroDash> 10it was a bad moment for me, and I think it's appropriate I tell you all about it
<Aponymous> 0L-L-L-L-L-LOVE ME!
<SirSprinkles> 6We were waiting for you... and you never showed... Oo
<HuffytheMagicDragon> Yuotube?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> I ain't haytin
<RainBroDash> 10Ghosties saw it all, so you'll no doubt hear from him too
<HuffytheMagicDragon> no worriez
<DarkenedPath> *youtube, typo
<SirSprinkles> 6We share everything, it's kinda mod rules.
<Metal_Link> Well I came in and no one was there except for a few idle people.
<RainBroDash> 10The way it went down was I got unfortunately taunted into a position where I couldn't help but try and explain to the shitty viewers why I deserve to be a mod, and this ended up with me suggesting -why- I deserved to be a mod, in turn suggesting some of the content of the selection process. It was dumb and I've apologised and I won't hesitate to apologise aga
<RainBroDash> 10wall of text time
<NewManiac> What is this called?
<Ziltoid> fluttershy sparta remix
<Ziltoid> I think
<DarkenedPath> you're going to love me sparta remix
<HuffytheMagicDragon> Hank hill kick your ass sparta!
<Dave_BroZilla> I still think Don't Stop Believing/Enter Sandman mash-up should be played
<HuffytheMagicDragon> ORLY?
<RainBroDash> 10Basically I was getting a few subtle digs about not being here for the longest time, and what I should have done is ignored it, but (I think due to the sheer amount of time in the stream, this was 12 hours after we started) I snapped a bit
<SirSprinkles> 6That's... odd.
<Ziltoid> whats that band called?
<Roara|TF2> 6it seems like TF2 isn't working for me
<Ziltoid> I eard it before
<DarkenedPath> how about NO
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll talk it over with the other mods, Metal.
<Dave_BroZilla> Rock Sugar. Lead singer was voice of Wakko Warner
<NewManiac> I want to play the song 'I'm Awesome' over this GIF.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> whut is odd delarobia?
<Roara|TF2> 6its taking FOREVER to look for a game
<Ziltoid> oh what
<Metal_Link> I came in late because some ding dong at the internet company killed one of the fiber optic cables and I had no internet all day on Thursday.
<TGPFluttershy> FUCK YES!
<dance1212> BUTTERFLY
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, that explains it then.
<BronyTj> hey, i'm actually here
<Roara|TF2> 6unless there's literally NO ONE playing
<Hipster_Brony> in the future, if anyone questions your legitimacy as a mod, tell them we hired you because we are convinced you would be an effective moderator
<Aponymous> 0SO MUCH yay
<HuffytheMagicDragon> he finished your optic cables Sam Fisher
<BronyTj> and gummy
<SirSprinkles> 6Apparently Metal_Link had no internet all Thursday.
<NewManiac> Can't tell if want.
<TGPFluttershy> DJ FlyShy in da house!
<Hipster_Brony> if they have a problem with it they can complain to us
<Aponymous> 0Gummy = Samurai
<Dave_BroZilla> I'M TURNING JAPANESE TURNING JAPANESE TURNING JAPANESE I REALLY THINK SO
<HuffytheMagicDragon> aiiiiiiiiiii samuraiiiiiiiiiiiii
<TGPFluttershy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJHvzJiiXAM
<Soarin> needs more Shutterfly
<Hipster_Brony> but you shouldnt need to defend your legitimacy as a mod
<RainBroDash> 10I know Hipster, and it was fucking stupid of me to stoop to it
<SirSprinkles> 6The links. No.
<SirSprinkles> 6Even if it is what I'm playing.
<Hipster_Brony> what exactly did you say?
<RainBroDash> 10we'll have to rely on dari for that
<HuffytheMagicDragon> needs moar sluttershy
<RainBroDash> 10I was fucking livid, so I forgot to screencap
<Aponymous> 0I first heard this song when someone put it over the knife fight in RE4.
<Hipster_Brony> give me the gist of it
<TGPFluttershy> Sorry SirSprinkles
<Espeon> 06time to nom
<Espeon> 06and o.o
<dance1212> i first heard this song playing dance dance revolution
<HuffytheMagicDragon> skaiii samuraiiii aiiiii
<SirSprinkles> 6If somepony needs it, they can ask me and I'll post it.
<Metal_Link> I tried coming in on Friday but chat was crazy from Brony Movie night so there was no chance. So I decided to come back today in the morning and here all of you are with a tame chat.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> ddr? whut version?
<RainBroDash> 10Two people in particular were saying how much longer they've been watching BMN than me, and talking about my 'sudden ascension' to mod status (which is just the wrong way to get it, completely) so I said something along the lines of:
<dance1212> cant remember
<gorutsuki> so what are we watching and when? first time here
<dance1212> the one with the butterfly song
<Elky> we're starting in an hour
<SirSprinkles> 6Check the home page, gorutsuki
<Dave_BroZilla> HuffytheMagicDragon >>mfw sluttershy http://i56.tinypic.com/2cffi14.png
<HuffytheMagicDragon> I got ultramix2 with a dance mat for my old XBOX
<SirSprinkles> 6 20 minutes, we're starting in.
<gorutsuki> okay thanks
<NewManiac> I would've stayed here yesterday but the lag was too great. I only get to see WWU.
<Elky> oh right
<Ziltoid> tron?
<Dave_BroZilla> Derezzed?
<Elky> fuck my being unable to calculate
<dance1212> i have euromix 1 and 2
<HuffytheMagicDragon> WAT? LOLOLOLOOLOLOLO X D XD
<Elky> you'd think that if you're majoring in math you'd be good with numbers...
<DarkenedPath> i was trolling yesterday. i said winter wrap up sucked.
<dance1212> i played the others at an arcades
<Pinkamina_> SirSprinkles, when does thw drawing happen?
<RainBroDash> 10"I wasn't plucked out of the crowd as if to say 'RBD you'll do', I applied, went through an interview process and was tested on my worth and how I can actually help BMN, and my modding history, etc" <- that was the part that was stupid to say. Ghosties pointed out to me in mod chat that it was unacceptable to mention the interview process, to keep it the same
<RainBroDash> 10for every individual applicant
<Nittany_Tiger> I almost minored in Math.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> they see me trollin' they kickin'
<Seychelles> o_o;
<Elky> that song is good...
<DarkenedPath> no kicks. i avoided them
<Elky> what is it?
<TGPFluttershy> I could drown in this track forever
<dance1212> euro mix 2 i fc'ed most apart from the end of the century
<J-Lugia> Aurora, it's pretty much the same for me, but once inside it works fine. It's usually connecting to the server that slows it down
<TGPFluttershy> Daft Punk - Derezzed
<dance1212> that was a bitch
<HuffytheMagicDragon> avoided them like dead poniez
<Seychelles> oh whoops.
<Seychelles> I forgot I had another mIRC window |D

<SirSprinkles> 6And Nyan cat
<RainBroDash> 10Ghosties dealt with it at the time, but it had been happening gradually, I can't remember exactly, but it felt like I was just getting a bit of 'new mod' stick for quire a while
<Darky> 06Damos :3

<Hipster_Brony> i know you probably know this already, but im going to say it anyways
<Elky> caj: 'when you can'
<RainBroDash> 10I got a PM apology from dashite
<Ziltoid> Hooray
<HuffytheMagicDragon> I used antibacterial soap BITCH!!!!!
<Hipster_Brony> we need our mods to "stay above the fray" if you will
<Aponymous> 0*Wonders how Gummy goes with The Land of the Lost theme*
<Hipster_Brony> basically, dont get angry
<TGPFluttershy> Gummy = Guile
<Nittany_Tiger> Play Tool.
<BronyTj> WEIRD AL
<Hipster_Brony> if you're having issues, vent about them in mod chat
<DarkenedPath> angry white boy polka next?
<NewManiac> Aponymous, Gummy goes well with everything.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> req: konata is sky high
<Hipster_Brony> but dont show your anger in the main room and dont moderate from a place of anger
<Hipster_Brony> because thats how bad decisions get made
<SirSprinkles> 6Vent here if you need to.
<Hipster_Brony> and as a mod, you're representing the entire team
<SirSprinkles> 6And let one of the other mods handle it if you get angry.
<RainBroDash> 10Yeah. I personally felt like I wasn't doing too badly for the first 11 and a half hours xD but I completely understand. and it's a lesson that I ended up learning it a stupid way, instead of the sensible, gradual way
<BronyTj> i like this medly the most
<Nittany_Tiger> Req: Parabola (w/ Parabol).
<Hipster_Brony> so the things you do affect how people see all of us
<NewManiac> I think could work with 'Fuck The Police'
<HuffytheMagicDragon> from ghost ride it?
<Armageddon> shit
<Armageddon> it's 4am
*Armageddon sleeps
<RainBroDash> 10I'm really sorry again. I got pretty mad last night too, and I need to make sure I apologise to Ghosties too, cause I vented at him a little bit, just in case I inadvertently offended him at all
<HuffytheMagicDragon> still no twi posters in this library
<CAJ> Braeburn is Snoop Dog.
<CAJ> This is canon.
<Soyuz> ohai Ray
<HuffytheMagicDragon> canon camera canon
<RainBroDash> 10just covering all the bases. the worst thing would be for this incident to carry on further, it was a stupid thing to do, and I believe I've learned from the experience
<Dave_BroZilla> RARITY IS A GOLD DIGGER
<Aponymous> 0CAJ: That is GENIUS.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll print some Twi posters out and put them discretely in the nearby library.
<Dave_BroZilla> But she still best pony
<HuffytheMagicDragon> inddeed
<Elky> NO SHE ISN'T
<HuffytheMagicDragon> thankz
<Elky> okay, maybe
<BronyTj> PINKIE PIE IS WEIRD AL
<SirSprinkles> 6Once I start the ep, I'm gonna go check my bank account at the ATM in store to see if my wire transfer went through.
<TGPFluttershy> Tried to get some Twilight posters in my library, Librarian said she wants more "Student work"
<CAJ> She is best Marshmallow
<SirSprinkles> 6Just saying that now.
<NewManiac> All ponies are best pony.
<Nittany_Tiger> I want a Rainbow Dash meteo-related poster.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> student work? BS

<CAJ> Elky, the most epic of Brohoofs
<Hipster_Brony> ok
<HuffytheMagicDragon> manual labor pony is best in some cases
<TGPFluttershy> After yesterday, iamokwiththis.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> and rainbro, you're fine, just wanted to make sure you knew that
<SirSprinkles> 6GUMMY GOES WITH EVERYTHING.
<Elky> the most
<gorutsuki> this song is making me feel so epic right now
<Hipster_Brony> modding here can be a little stressful at times
*Ray got nickalerted
<SirSprinkles> 6>a little
<Ray> 02Hi~
<DarkenedPath> all ponies are equal but some are more equal than others
<SirSprinkles> 6Let's go with that...
<HuffytheMagicDragon> =
<Elky> slowpoke
<BronyTj> fluttershy is most equal
<SirSprinkles> 6And that's really modding ANYWHERE...
<Ziltoid> ITS NEVER STOPS
<RainBroDash> 10Yeah it was just so stupid
<NewManiac> Gummy is best pony, now that I think about it.
<Dave_BroZilla> Rarity is more equal than fluttershy
*Nittany_Tiger need a Charisma check to find Penn State bronies and infect every library with Twi Read posters.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> loop'd
<Aponymous> 0This is the most epic repetitive loop ever.
<DarkenedPath> i am trying to see who gets the refrence
<SirSprinkles> 6"What makes you so high-and-mighty?" Is a frequent thing you'll have to deal with...
<Dave_BroZilla> Animal Famr
<HuffytheMagicDragon> gewdd, very gewd
<Dave_BroZilla> Farm*
<Hipster_Brony> exactly
<Elky> can we just skip the movies and watch this for the whole evening?
*EspyLacopa is finally watching the last episodes of C - The Money of Soul and Possibility Control.
<DarkenedPath> *brohoof* good job
<HuffytheMagicDragon> transfarmers comic on eqd naw
<RainBroDash> 10it was just the fact I was new though, and that it was my first night
<EspyLacopa> O.o
<gorutsuki> I didn't finish watching animal farm
<Dave_BroZilla> schweet
<RainBroDash> 10I'm hoping the bullshit from those guys will be a teething problem
<Dave_BroZilla> Movie was terrible
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, which is why it was good Ghosties was there.
<Dave_BroZilla> Book was great, though
<Ignaesia> read the book
<SirSprinkles> 6I honestly feel bad for having left earlier than I usually do.
<DarkenedPath> book was helluva lot better
<RainBroDash> 10He dealt with it amazingly, I mean, 100% tribute to the guy
<Elky> there was an animal farm movie?
<Elky> ugh
<Hipster_Brony> one thing i get a lot is people saying the mods are all attention horses because we post in color and dont let anyone else
<Aponymous> 0i still need to read Animal Farm one of these days.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> didn't finish watching van helsing either way too long
<TGPFluttershy> You don't wanna know...
<Dave_BroZilla> Had a lassie-like dog as the protagonist
<Elky> gotta request it as a b movie
<Ignaesia> You should read it, its a pretty short book anyway
<Nittany_Tiger> I bet there was an Animal Farm game based on the movie. :p
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, but that's because we NEED people to be able to see what we're saying, which is annoying.
<EspyLacopa> Doug the talking dog of Up?
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<NewManiac> I have to read Animal Farm for school over the Summer.
<Dave_BroZilla> which I don't think it really existed in a major role in the book, if at all
<Hipster_Brony> and thats the kind of shit that comes with the territory
<Elky> aponymous have you read 1984? if not, read it first
<gorutsuki> oh god it would be a terrible game
<RainBroDash> 10If gummy goes with anything... and Guile's theme goes with anything...
<Dave_BroZilla> We already came to that conclusion before
<SirSprinkles> 6Already did Gummy Guile.
<BronyTj> PUT GUILES THEME ON
<Soarin> anythingception?
<Elky> slowpoke rainbro
<BronyTj> DO IT AGAIN I WASN'T HERE
<SirSprinkles> 6Maybe right before the mane stream.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i have to read on writing well, genghis khan, and still life with rice
<Aponymous> 0Elky: It's on my "Don't have, want to read" list with an assload of other books.
<Nittany_Tiger> No. Tool.
<NewManiac> RainBroDash? Like the guy that was on Bronyville?
<Hipster_Brony> just wanted to tell you all that because i guarantee it wont be the first time you deal with people questioning your legitimacy
<NewManiac> Wait, nevermind.
<gorutsuki> looptiy loopity loop
<HuffytheMagicDragon> please stop spike you're scaring everypony
<Ignaesia> dat sax
<Hipster_Brony> hell, i STARTED this thing and i get people telling me im not qualified to be a mod
<Elky> i know that feel apon
<Dave_BroZilla> Oh, so desperately want everybody to enjoy Don't Stop Believing/Enter Sandman mash-up T.T
<Nittany_Tiger> XD
<Aponymous> 0This song is SAXY
<Hipster_Brony> 8NYAN
<TGPFluttershy> ALL MY LOVE!
<Ziltoid> Yeah
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i played alto sax, then switched to baritone, i know big sax don't make a big man
<TGPFluttershy> ALL MY MONEY!
<Darf14> we all love NYAN
<TGPFluttershy> ALL MY NYAN!
<Aponymous> 0NOOOOOOOOOOO
<gorutsuki> all of my, take it all
<Dave_BroZilla> I play Tenor sax now
<RainBroDash> 10i got really angry at myself, because I felt like by not modding properly I'd misrepresented myself in the application, therefore had failed your trust in me : / I mean all I can do is amend the way I deal with people questioning my ability. By attempting to defend my legitimacy as a mod I ended up jeopardising it
<EspyLacopa> Just found a video of Guile's theme with a sonic rainboom.
<SirSprinkles> 6It happens every day to every one of us... >>; You just learn to leave it be.
<Elky> gummy is like... a super meme
<NewManiac> Must.
<Dave_BroZilla> Thinking of becoming an infamous YouTube musician
<TGPFluttershy> I have a personal record of 13 hours of it.
<NewManiac> Resist
<NewManiac> Text Wall
<ValtheJean> we should make a copy of this gummy vid, nyan-tize the left one, and tac-tize the right one, and then play the two songs at the same time
<Bjornfot> nyan
<SirSprinkles> 6And dude, you're fine, don't stress over it.
<Aponymous> 0Hmm, Gummy DOES go well with this.
<Elky> o.O
<Hipster_Brony> thats another thing
<Darf14> a gummy version of NYAN....DIBS!
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i know a kid named kenny who sat next to me and was arrogant as hell playing tenor sax he was too loud
<Hipster_Brony> you're going to mess up
<SirSprinkles> 6GUMMY. GOES. WITH. EVERYTHING.
<Hipster_Brony> all of us mess up
<Hipster_Brony> you have to have a short memory and get over it fast
<Nittany_Tiger> Prove it. Tool song.
<Dave_BroZilla> Hah, my teacher had a helluva time getting me to play loud on sax
<gorutsuki> sirsprinkles is indeed correct
<NewManiac> This GIF even proves Gummy goes with Gummy.
<RainBroDash> 10kinda sucks to do it on the first day. that means if I -dont- mess up tonight it's essentially going against the trend :L
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bjkM_y-Wps
<Aponymous> 0SirSprinkles has proven this today, he deserves a medal of some kind.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> you need inhalerz for yer lungz
<Dave_BroZilla> I just play movie themes and Clarence Clemons sax solos, or at least the sheet music I can find for the Springsteen songs
<NewManiac> I used that video to make someone a brony.
<Hipster_Brony> 8no video links espy
<RainBroDash> 10well I've had about 10 hours sleep last night, so let's hope I don't falter by the end of the stream tonight
<Soyuz> Ray; play Morrowind BU
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i like the meaning of truth with rainboom
<Hipster_Brony> like i said, dont beat yourself up over it
<BronyTj> NYAN

<Aponymous> 0OH HAI GHOSTIES

<Ghosties> 4Hello everyone
<Dave_BroZilla> Word to big bird, Ghosties is here
<Darf14> Hello
<Elky> oh, ghosties
<Hipster_Brony> we still have faith in you as a moderator, one mistake like that isnt going to change that
<UxieLover> 11I'm not going to be on for long. Just around ten minutes
<Dave_BroZilla> GO GO PIRATE RANGERS
<EspyLacopa> The main stream has started?
<Elky> hey
<Lolipop_of_Doom> MY DAMN COMPUTER IS SHITTY
<TGPFluttershy> Ghosties!
<NewManiac> RainBro, I realized I was mistaken. I got you confused with RanBrony.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> that girl on eqd knew it ALL
<Elky> don't remind me of pirate rangers...
<HuffytheMagicDragon> suppppp ghostiez
<Dave_BroZilla> :B
<RainBroDash> 10it turns out that when I picked my name there was a guy who'd already started posting on ponychan (where I don't really go) under the name Rain Bro Dash...
<EspyLacopa> Pirate Pony Rangers?
<Hipster_Brony> and the fact that you told us means you learned from it
<RainBroDash> 10also, GUILE'S THEME
<Darf14> Pirate Rangers was ok, but it wasn't my cup of tea
<Elky> SO. EPIC
<SirSprinkles> 6Mistaken identity. It happens everywhere.
<gorutsuki> guile's theme eh? amin event is next
<gorutsuki> *main
<RainBroDash> 10Speak of the devil, sup Ghosties
<SirSprinkles> 6Everypony likes to think I'm the writer of Cupcakes. Which we're not going to get into.
<Elky> really?
<Elky> heh
<Nittany_Tiger> RainBro is temp admin?
<Elky> so are you?
<Aponymous> 0GUMMY + GUILE'S THEME = DESTRUCTION OF WORLD FROM AWESOME
<gorutsuki> really? was it you?
<Hipster_Brony> as if by magic
<Ignaesia> which ep is first?
<Metal_Link> Same name as author?
<Darf14> Winter Wrap Up
<Hipster_Brony> 8nittany: nope
<CAJ> Y U DODGY SIRSPRINKLES GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE, HMMMM?
<Ignaesia> WWU? sweet :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Close to same name.
<Elky> ignaesia: Mare in the Moon
<Ghosties> Hey RainBro
<Elky> *trollface*
<Ghosties> Magic, Hip?
<Ignaesia> :O
<Hipster_Brony> 8RainBroDash is a full mod here
<Nittany_Tiger> Also, around 1/2 of the BronyState mods are from PA. I think PA is the center of the internet. I know so many people from PA online.
<Ignaesia> haha
<Darf14> Oh U troll :)
<SirSprinkles> 6Sergeant Sprinkles...Sir Sprinkles...
<HuffytheMagicDragon> searched my name on google, there is another huffythemagicdragon onprincesstrollestia.tumblr.com
<Dave_BroZilla> I thought the world already blew up from awesomeness from two Falcon Punches colliding
<Dave_BroZilla> unless...that means the world exploded twice!
<Metal_Link> Hipster_Brony I'm here, a little late (2 days late) but I'm here. I have been having troubles contacting.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> TWICE?!?!
<Hipster_Brony> RBD was telling us about the incident last night
<SirSprinkles> 6We're already discussing it, Metal.
<Elky> albi the racist dragon
<gorutsuki> oh okay looks like I won't stupidly get confused about who wrote cupcakes then
<Ghosties> Ah, I see
<Nittany_Tiger> Reminds me of The Demented Cartoon Movie.
<Aponymous> 0Dave_Brozilla: It was remade, and re-destroyed by Gummy and Guile's theme
<SirSprinkles> 6We're waiting for more mods to get on.
<NewManiac> We need to do this exact same thing with different GIFS, like Twilight clapping.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> 1 minute left!
<Dave_BroZilla> So, like Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy?
<Nittany_Tiger> "How many time did the world blow up now?" "I lost count"
<Elky> no, it only works with gummy
<Aponymous> 0Dave_Brozilla: Exactly!
<Dave_BroZilla> Guess Douglas Adams had it right all along
<Hipster_Brony> also, sprinkles, should we still interview Metal Link next week even with Sathi's app?
<Metal_Link> I'm still sorry ._.
<RainBroDash> 10sent you a pm dude x
<Icydragon3d> k
<NewManiac> Or Pinkie running backwards.
<RainBroDash> 10ghosties
<SirSprinkles> 6I think so, Hipster.
<Espeon> 06Brees
*Espeon back too
<SirSprinkles> 6Since Metal is trying to be a streamer.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> running backwards like fat albert movie
<SirSprinkles> 6IIRC
<Hipster_Brony> he is
<Hipster_Brony> but
<Darf14> while I wait I will try to beat a rpg in 30 seconds, BRB
<gorutsuki> that smile on gummy is just slightly creepy
<EspyLacopa> http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/3487/130394362282.jpg <-- *snerk*
<Hipster_Brony> i dont know if we should hire 2 more mods
<SirSprinkles> 6We wouldn't.
<Stormy> he needs to learn to stick around for more than a couple seconds
<SirSprinkles> 6He'd just be next in line.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> saw it b4 YAWN
<SirSprinkles> 6We won't need another streamer for a bit anyway.
<Elky> one of these alligators drugged and raped the other
<NewManiac> We all do, Espy.
<gorutsuki> EspyLacopa that's been out there for a while
<Hipster_Brony> and im pretty sure sathi is going to be the one we add
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, announcements time.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> but thaknz still
<Aponymous> 0I just realized, Gummy took a bath with Twilight.

<EspyLacopa> I see no such rule link above my chat window.
<gorutsuki> wait is there a steam group?
<ValtheJean> sometimes it's below
<NewManiac> I just think Twilght saying "Spike, wake up it's Winter Wrap Up day!" Is fucking adoarble. I don't know why.
<ValtheJean> it depends on your browser
<dance1211> COLOUR
<Dave_BroZilla> Watch how she loses the boots, saddle and scarf after the main theme
<IronPoptart> Bitch go back to sleep.
<EspyLacopa> ....Above my chat window, is the wall behind my computer.
<Bjornfot> COLOUR.
<RainBroDash> 10CAJ you're such a COLOURFUL character :>

<gorutsuki> white is all the colors
<Razyn> Elky Hi!!!
<HuffytheMagicDragon> rascist
<CAJ> if you combine paint colors, you get shit brown
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Hi Antartican bronies!
<RainBroDash> 10Purple'Prose I guess not. that tends to be when DCD streams, and we've got SirSprinkles streaming
<Dave_BroZilla> SPOILERS: ALL OF THEM
<DragonRage> Good morning and/or afternoon and possibly evening to everyone.
<Elky> 'just slap different colours on it and it's cool!'
<Ignaesia> sad twilight scene makes me cry manly tears
<Bjornfot> White is my FAVOURITE colour!
<RainBroDash> 10I guess ask sprinkles when he gets back from checking his bank balance
<EspyLacopa> CAJ: The trick to remember is that with painting, the three primary colors aren't red, blue, and yellow, they're Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.
<Darf14> Twilight sure can jump
<dance1211> dislike americans is not racist
<Dave_BroZilla> Red is best colour
<IronPoptart> Aaaaaaaaaaaaand song time!

<dance1211> how long did they spend rehursing this?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> OLD
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll work on getting it for the future.
<Fengor> you're right dance1211 it's not racist; just as ignorant and short sighted as hating any large group for general and petty reasons; like spelling differences
<Elky> aww
<RainBroDash> 10oh shit
<HuffytheMagicDragon> right
<RainBroDash> 10fsagdfijgkiasdh
*IronPoptart is bouncing in her seat

<Ghosties> 4Conflicting views
<Elky> APPLE PONY IS BEST PONY
<gorutsuki> govva give it to ponies to randomly break out into song and know the words off by heart
<TGPFluttershy> Fluttershy verse is best verse
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Me, Ignaesia :D
<NewManiac> All verse is best verse.
<Aponymous> 0DR. WHOOVES VERSE IS BEST VERSE
<Ignaesia> :D
<IronPoptart> Long neck BonBon!
<ProtoPony> Rarity's part of Fluttershy's version is the best
<HaveTubaWillTravel> A Christmas ep in s2 is NEEDED
<EspyLacopa> Needs more Spike Verse.
<dance1211> all verse is best verse
<Ghosties> Again, mod business stays mod buisness ;)
<Darf14> all verses are the best
<Purple`Prose> THIS SONG WILL NEVER LEAVE MY HEAD!!!
<Ghosties> ...minus the kiss
<ProtoPony> that voice <3
<RainBroDash> 10COLGATE >:3
<Hipster_Brony> lol
<Ghosties> stupid emoticon
<Razyn> Brushie brushie
<CAJ> Hipster_Brony is in denial of the AJ verse
<Elky> tgp: YOU NEED TO TYPE IN CAPS OR NOONE WILL UNDERSTAND YOU
<DragonRage> Singing Shy is adorable.
<Aponymous> 0Pony Christmas episode = I can die happy
<Metal_Link> This song will be playing after death.
<RenegadeBrony> 0Agressive Brush tactics, GO!
<Bjornfot> Is it just me, or is Dash incredibly sexy in dat vest?
<gorutsuki> dr whooves
<BronyTj> SPIKE MUST SING IN AN EPISODE
<Ghosties> 4Is Winter Wrap Up technically considered the "Christmas" ep?
<Ignaesia> AJ ftw
<RainBroDash> 10I love it
<Dave_BroZilla> I was not posting in caps before it was cool
<IronPoptart> Bad news, Caramel's gonna lose the grass seeds.
<Darf14> At least this song doesn't get stuck in my head too bad, Ducktails on the other hand....
<RainBroDash> 10and yeah yeah i just
<CAJ> AJ VERSE IS BEST VERSE NO MATTER WHAT HIPSTER_BRONY THINKS
<Razyn> Dr. Whooves is on every team. He has to research this important event.
<RainBroDash> 10bleugh
<SirSprinkles> 6Gummy pony is best pony.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I s'pose it could be
<RainBroDash> 10K :D
<EspyLacopa> IronPoptart: And it must be suitably epic.
<dance1211> applejacks verse is worst verse
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Also a new year's ep
<BronyTj> spike is best pony
<HuffytheMagicDragon> best part with rest for dramatic planting
<Ghosties> Don't worry about it, just stay with the main room
<TGPFluttershy> Fluttershy is still best pony.
<ValtheJean> Dinky, I doth <3 you
<Bjornfot> AJ verse=best
<NewManiac> Dinky Doo!

<EspyLacopa> Spike must sing in season 2.
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder if sharp temp jumps accompany these manual season changes?
<Ghosties> Eyes open, bro
<Metal_Link> I wonder if there is a Santa Pony.
<Hipster_Brony> its just that we dont want people knowing if our mod team is down a few people so they can try to break the rules
<RainBroDash> 10Ghosties it's not christmas D:
<EspyLacopa> Same for Trollestia and Luna.
<RainBroDash> 10It's spring!
<DragonRage> Applejack's verse bugs me for one reason. She sounds like she's whining about having to work hard.
<BronyTj> TGPFluttershy: *brohoof*
<Metal_Link> Christmas in July.
<IronPoptart> Wow, is that still Tara Strong singing there?
<Ignaesia> AJ and RBD have the best verses = they are sung by the same VA. Mind blown
<HuffytheMagicDragon> see ya gaiz gotta go see ya next time hopefully
<dance1211> why can't twilight use magic?
<ValtheJean> meh, it should just stay a "Winter" episode, not put in any of those holidays

<BronyTj> we can turn the episode off now
<IronPoptart> *Aw.
<EspyLacopa> Yes, Luna will be in S2, but the next question is if she will sing.
<Ignaesia> dance1211 because its tradition in ponyville
<Ghosties> 4Is it Heil?
<UxieLover> 11Sorry
<Ghosties> 4I said HIEL yesterday, I think
<DashAttack> oh well, at least i didn't miss the audio

<Aponymous> 0"Whats a birds nest?"
<CAJ> THIS IS- Dammit RainBroDash
<Elky> where are you from soarin?
<Darf14> Too bad they don't sell red bull in Equestria
<TGPFluttershy> And then he gets trolled back.
<Soarin> Düsseldorf :3
<BronyTj> I syphasize with spike
<BronyTj> i stayed up all night and i'm tired as fuck
<Ghosties> 4IronPoptart: Food for thought indeed
<Hipster_Brony> 8Spike troll is best troll
<Ignaesia> give Pinkie a red bull
<Bjornfot> inb4 spike is master troll
<Elky> dang, all other german bronies live so far away from me
<dance1211> rarity, that nest looks like shit
<WinstonChurchill> Rarity's so OCD.
<EspyLacopa> Twilight's bird nest breaks the rules of physics.
<Ghosties> 4ALL ORGANIZED :D
<Soarin> where you at, Elky?
<Purple`Prose> And then Rarity killd everypony.
<ValtheJean> @IronPoptart obviously they used Pinkies crazy contraption
<Razyn> Oshit.
<Metal_Link> What is that monstrosity?!
<Elky> dresden xD
<Darf14> Birds don't build nest, Ponies do it for them, dang nature class lied to me
<IronPoptart> OF COURSE
<gorutsuki> gee it's already 4 in the morning over here and still watching ponies
<RainBroDash> 10CAJ: YOU'RE TOO SLOOOW
<Soarin> damn, ok :p
<Metal_Link> My eyes!
<IronPoptart> Nice outhouse by the way.
<CAJ> IronPoprart THEY SHOT AJ OUT OF A CANNON

<dance1211> rarity doesn't give a shit
<Bjornfot> OUTHOUSE
<IronPoptart> Hah!
<dance1211> dat plot
<DragonRage> Rarity plot.
<TGPFluttershy> RainBroDash Why...?
<CAJ> lol RainBroDash has anyone not played Brawl at this point/
<BronyTj> \spike just bassicly suggested they shit in it
<DragonRage> So well groomed.
<BronyTj> You know-for kids!
<Bjornfot> dat ass wigglin
<RainBroDash> 10>:3
<HaveTubaWillTravel> TWINKIE PINKIE
<Metal_Link> Ice skating at the rock farm.
<EspyLacopa> Notice how she keeps removing parts from the failed nest. . .but it never actually gets smaller.
<Ignaesia> awesome bgm here
<Razyn> RainBroDash: I'm leaning toward Disgaea, but they already reference other stuff.
<Metal_Link> Easy as Pinkie Pie.
<NewManiac> This episode has an aggressive amount of plot.
<ValtheJean> infinite bird nest
<IronPoptart> Easy as a PINKIE pie! *rimshot*
<TGPFluttershy> But that was before Ezio took over the voice of Sonic
<Darf14> mmm....Pie
<Dave_BroZilla> Anyone who hasn't played BRawl by now hates Nintendo with a passion, and they need to be condemned
<dance1211> pinkie is ice skating, this is helping winter why?
<Ghosties> 4CAJ: I didn't get the reference
<IronPoptart> Oh fuck I was late.
<RainBroDash> 10Razyn I think you got it right by getting it wrong?
<Hipster_Brony> 8FACEICE
<CAJ> Ghosties I am disappoint
<BronyTj> it helps becuase pinkie is skating
<Elky> actually, they make her skate so she's out of the way, the ice doesn't actually be broken
<Ignaesia> bambi reference?
<RainBroDash> 10It was Brawl, but probably referenced on there
<gorutsuki> acutally you guys have fun I'm just going to go to sleep since it's really early in the day
<Hipster_Brony> 8this is my fetish
<ValtheJean> What if we *played* Brawl, but really didn't care for it?
<Bjornfot> natural disaster
<Ghosties> 4Well, CAJ, that's, like, your opinion, man >:I
<RainBroDash> 10ValtheJean then you win
<NewManiac> *See's Pinkie skate for about 1-2 seconds*"You're the best skater I've ever seen!"
<TGPFluttershy> *Cough* MK9 *Cough
<Dave_BroZilla> Well, you experienced it at least
<Elky> I can clop to this
<ValtheJean> :D
<RainBroDash> 10Because it was the worst Smash yet
