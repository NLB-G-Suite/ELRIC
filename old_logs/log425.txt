<Gunthler> TheRainbowDash: :3
<pyrocatboy> alexxm: I dunno.
<alexxm> they'ld probably run out of ideas thoug Biglaw
<Skylands> 10Gyrados backwards, Sodarayg
<drf|osx> the new one I bought should come with one so I suppose I can just wait on mailing it until that comes in
<junh1024-XD> M_BISON_YES.avi
<Krakass> Do you really want that to happen to ponies?
<Skylands> 10Pronounced soda rage
<Skul> and it will, WITH THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!
<Biglaw> Krakass then ponies will take over
<Kyubree> 07isn't the ps2 cable the same thing
<TheRainbowDash> http://fav.me/d46t2hv 2000% faster than all of the other karts out there.:)
<drf|osx> is it?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ok
<pikorar> Biglaw: Minus the fact that they took decades to write a movie.
<K_A> What Krakass said.
<Kyubree> 07pretty sure
<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<drf|osx> hm
<Drake> 04So that's why my Gyarados inexplicably got confused everytime I used SOda Pop on it

<Drake> 04!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Drake, you are a 3Probopass.
<Drake> 048I
<drf|osx> that begs the question: where is my PS*2* cable :P
<K_A> I think FiM can hold strong for 5-8 seasons, depending on their strategy.
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Aww yeah! Fucking right!
*Drake noses people
<Biglaw> Sad face....
<Biglaw> :(
<Aurora> 6uh
<Skylands> 10Probopass is an imposter Mario
<Angel_Umbreon> 13AT least you're not probing anyone
<pikorar> Why sad face?
<Aurora> 6probably should google that one
<drf|osx> well I can see if the p
<drf|osx> plug fitgs
<drf|osx> -g
<drf|osx> if I find it
<Gunthler> TheRainbowDash: I want that Dashie Kart :d
<Krakass> I could make do with 8 years of ponies.
<Aurora> 6cuz if that's true, I guess I can switch my cable between the PS2/PS3
<Biglaw> what Krakass said
<TheRainbowDash> Gunthler: Who doesn't?:D
<drf|osx> but the first-gen PS3 I bought is coming with the regular cable
<Krakass> 26 episodes * eight years is plenty.
<drf|osx> so I can wait for that and just put it in the box, if you want
<pikorar> Yeah.
<drf|osx> I just use HDMI for everything DX
<drf|osx> *XD
<TheRainbowDash> 26 times 8 seasons=208 episodes, amazing.
<pikorar> I don't want MLP to become just one big forced show like the Simpsons.
<K_A> You guys know how anime like, just examples, Shakugan no Shana and Code Geass, have second seasons with a new series title?
<cachi01> FIM can last as long as spongebob has lasted 13 years
<Sumica> 00,10Hi all

<cachi01> HIIIIIII SUMICA want a train??
<howdyx> hello
<CupcakeWarrior> Hai Sumica
<alexxm> hey Sumica hows your day been
<K_A> I suspect that MLP may take that route so that Hasbro can syndicate the "original series" while continuing it.
<Aurora> 6kk
<Krakass> How's it cooking?
<Gunthler> ohai Sumica
<mario_pony_> guess what everypony
<K_A> That's my speculation at least.

<Krakass> What are these intarwebs you speak of?
<K_A> alexxm: "You guys know how anime like, just examples, Shakugan no Shana and Code Geass, have second seasons with a new series title?"

<alexxm> thanks TheRainbowDash you don't mind me asking what the pictures are do you
<Shamroc> Meanwhile..you up for a game in l4d2?
<Monfang> It will sorta be how I would have handled the whole controversy. An episode about her and the Mane 6 getting to know her.
<Chrysalis> prince-dari seems legit
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Sure.
<TheRainbowDash> prince-dari: Hahaha, from $200,000 to $700.:D

<cachi01> Monfang x Chrysalis
<OmegaMaretroidBrony> Dafuq
<KwakLad> well then alexxm its a giant luna picture in minecraft shown from birds eye view (so the image is larger and therefore of better quality than if the picture was stood vertically), and TRD's was a rainbow dash version... just to clarify
<Shamroc> Jaketehsnake...you want to paly some l4d2?
<Monfang> Hm?
<Meanwhile> dari: Is it bad that I want to buy that?
<pikorar> prince-dari: That's how my mom and dad met.

<prince-dari> Bottom left.
<Monfang> What made you say that?
<cachi01> yep
<alexxm> thanks KwakLad
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Dash putting up her hooves in the air, and standing up on her normally so, back hooves.
<Shamroc> or try to at least
<MadSurge> Truly, we can never have enough Derpy, but a full episode about her would ruin her
<drf|osx> yeah that's weird
<cachi01> my crazy little insane pinkie pied train liker head made me say that

<OmegaMaretroidBrony> :D
<TheRainbowDash> .....why do I still have the link in my tab bar?:D
<drf|osx> ith was lik e"This model of PS3 doesn't support PS2 software"
<drf|osx> at least Sony is honest :P

<TheRainbowDash> :|
<pony_35> Rules says you can't do that
<Shamroc> Jaketehsnake..join!
<KwakLad> Shamroc: its a bronystate rule, when someone notices Meanwhile is around, he is then not allowed to leave unless given permission by prince-dari
<asneakykitty> You may think you can see me mario_pony but actually, You have just fallen into my clever ruse. I'm actually on the moon right now
<CupcakeWarrior> Im fine with 34 of ponies though
<Jaketehsnake> Shamroc, Im on my way
<drf|osx> why not?
<drf|osx> also wtf
<TheRainbowDash> CupcakeWarrior: You do not have to share that publicly, you know...:D
<Meanwhile> KwakLad: that's a fairly new rule.
<drf|osx> OSX Firefox thinks mp3s are "binary file"s
<KwakLad> so Shamroc meanwhile is a little screwed when dari goes awol for a few weeks at a time

<Kandarihu> I understand killing the radroaches, but do you really need to kill the fellow people that you grew up with?
<cachi01> Spell-of-Gaming: i actually waslooking for some mods and a book mod appeared the description said now u could read harry potter books and the hunger games in minecraft!

<Enclave_Sparkle> Well, at least he's gonna end up with ALOT of ammo
<Umbreon> oh rly

<ponies47> STOP KILLING YOURSELF!
<pikorar> Thus ends the story of the Lone Wanderer... He tripped over a pipe.
<the_real_pony_1604> you know, in the time it took him to do that he could have just walked to the door like 5 times
<NightSeas> 02junh1024-XD*
<Lawlz> Yus.
<Kandarihu> One of the few things I know about this game is what can happen to Megaton. Are you going to make it happen?
<Krakass> Beggars apparently can be choosers
<NightSeas> 02true
<Java> So I just start a new game of Fallout 3. I need a name, any suggestion?

<Skylands> 10Failure?
<Krakass> It's not the fastest draw. But it's well concealed
<twilight_sprinkle> the guy was thinking about guns before he died
<Lawlz> If you push a bunch of raider corpses onto a car and then blow up the car, do they turn into a blob of sentient raider jelly?
<MahBoi777> cmon and slam, and welcome to the jam
<Meeplord> The Earth is FLAT duh
<Litwick> WHATCHA DOING WREK? OH NOTHIN', JUST STREAMIN' AND SHOOTIN'. STREAMIN' AND SHOOTIN'!
