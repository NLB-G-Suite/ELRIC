<SpadeKyruem[School]> just for shits and giggles

<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya XAX :)
<twixie_sprinkle> hoi XAX
<Chrysalis> you know who i miss
<DinkyDoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMc1oA9bdbM
<Chrysalis> AlexS
<Michael> hai XAX
<Cypresswolf> For those that dont know - I fell for a scam that sent me a text saying I won a $1000 target gift card - link went to a target look alike website - red flag went up when it sent me to a page off site wanting more infor outside of email, phone #, and name - "you have to sign up for one offer before your card can be sent" - Beware ponies
<AJIsHaunter> Gah, I hate it when my chat crashes.
<Chrysalis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FikyTcteMvE.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i am best cake ever!

<aniderp|bestcakeever> who wants a piece of me? :P
<AJIsHaunter> Chrysalis: What happened to AlexS?
<MadSurge> aniderp|bestcakeever: you sure are <3
<GilDash> Chrysalis: That was the first Brony song I really got into.
<Chrysalis> AJIsHaunter i don't know, he just stopped uploading
<Chrysalis> GilDash ikr
<Chrysalis> that was the song that really got me into the fandom
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxGWkon7WdQ
<Chrysalis> well, that and your gonna go far kid
<GilDash> Chrysalis: I remember raving to it at BUCK. Good times. ^_^
<AJIsHaunter> GilDash: By the way, how was BUCK?
<Chrysalis> BUCK was the best damn thing ever

<glitchdetector> I keep singing this for no reason: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0efX3B51dU&list=FLmiZH8kuI4snGqdkIX2Z0LQ
<pony_3045> big deal
<glitchdetector> why does it follow playlists ._.
<pony_3045> i know another horse vid on youtube with 10 million views
<XAX> The first brone song I ever heard was At the Winter Gala by Saltlakrits.
<Chrysalis> XAX also a good remixer
<pony_3045> but i'll got banned for them
<Cypresswolf> it started to rain just when our work was done :P but we got out 30 minutes early - not too shabby
<CrystalPhoenix> WILL IT BLEND
<SpadeKyruem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMIzhWt_pvY
<CrystalPhoenix> THAT IS THE QUESTION http://youtu.be/ahtZayhxb5U
<Chrysalis> iv not really heard much about the new songs being remixed
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Cypresswolf, why'd you fall for the scam in the first place, especially if you don't ever recall signing up to win $1,000 gift card?
<AJIsHaunter> It was dominian42 (Also known as Replacer) who really got the fandom, if I recall.
<AJIsHaunter> *got me into
<Cypresswolf> I shop at target quite a bit - pony merch and groceries - I thought it was legit
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i am worht a millllion dollars :P
<AJIsHaunter> I hate not typing out words. :D
<DinkyDoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMc1oA9bdbM

<Chrysalis> is almost perfectly timed to the song
<glitchdetector> Chrysalis: me too
<XAX> Cypresswolf: The worst thing you could do is put in your real email in the email field when posting on 4chan
*thelonecubone pokes AdamTheDuck :3
<Michael> :p
*AdamTheDuck glomps thelonecubone :P
*thelonecubone noms on AdamTheDuck :3
<glitchdetector> Oh god,
<thelonecubone> what?
<glitchdetector> I have to force myself to sleep
<Cypresswolf> I dont go to 4chan - other than links to pics posted here
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Cypresswolf, okay. If you get something that's asking for more than your name and address then you should automatically label it as scam
<glitchdetector> You guys keep me up all night
<pony_3045> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG9E00Sa2lg perfect fit here
<glitchdetector> I was going to bed a long while ago

<pony_3045> Her cutie mark for mining
<Cypresswolf> AssaultWithEmbraces: I found an ap called Unsubscribe - they put a folder in your email and any unwanted emails you get, you put in that folder and they unsubscribe you from those emails for you - don't even have to open them to do so - pretty good idea - the few I opened, the unsub link was broken or nonexistent
<pony_3045> not for making dresses or something
<Michael> dat overused meme
<BladedWings> Kipkat07_USAF: hmmm, that is a toughy...i say just try being friends since she has someone ^_^

<MadSurge> SpadeKyruem[School]: a ghost from Zelda I think
<SpadeKyruem[School]> CrystalPhoenix: Waah waah
<XAX> I saw the image ads for animaniacts on Facebook
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Deal with it
<Chrysalis> Michael not seen that one in AGES
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], I'm serious
<Kipkat07_USAF> BladedWings: she's the first female that ive been able to talk to nomally

<Michael> do u liek mmmmbananas
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SpadeKyruem[School]: Enemy from Kirby I think...
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], it had RPG elements though
<Sumica> 00,10now if they would just show it before or after ponies
<Cypresswolf> :O Animaniacs on the Hub O_O Alright! It's official - Im canceling ALL my other channels - no need to watch anything else!
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: remember when dari did a dub over that vid?
<Sumica> 00,10it woud make for a great saterday
<SpadeKyruem[School]> CrystalPhoenix: It tried to be a platformer rpg and it sucked
<thelonecubone|DI> Ohai SuperBrony64 :)
<Invi> SuperBrony64, the ghost?
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: Yeah, I had the same thought too.
<thelonecubone|DI> :3
<Michael> hey SuperBrony64 !
<SpadeKyruem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXZbQ0ZI4E4
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dat moo
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], yeah and Sticker Star is nothing of an RPG at all
<Sumica> 00,10Ponies, animaniacts,aquabats, danVs
<Ryunosuke> i dunno
<SpadeKyruem[School]> God I love Gooper blooper's boss theme
<BladedWings> Kipkat07_USAF: hmmm...well...like i said this is tough for me to help with :$
<Bronysith> Sumica: now we just need Batman TAS
<Buytoast> the boss theme is good
<Chrysalis> Bronysith i remember the mods doing some VERY wierd things on the quiet stream
<thelonecubone|DI> oh wow, my controll doesnt work >:I
<Ryunosuke> paper mario isnt terrible, it did remind me alot of Super Mario RPG
<MadSurge> Sumica: so much awesome in one channel!
<CrystalPhoenix> I LOVE Paper Mario
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Oh wait, the ghost is from Zelda
<CrystalPhoenix> but Sticker Star?
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: like when Nail-chan read the clopfics on the skype call ?
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: I knew it!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Also, hai :D
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Sticker star still has more rpg elements than super did
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: It was?
<ACS13123> SuperBrony64: O hai
<Chrysalis> oh god
<CrystalPhoenix> the only good tihng in that game are the puzzles in the levels
<Chrysalis> that was just stupidly funny
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Super is more a platformer than anything
<Buytoast> sticker star is simply a bad paper mario game
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: Also, mooooooo!
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], HA name one
<BladedWings> hi SuperBrony64

<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsHaunter: Yesh :3
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/AzjHl.png

<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: THey're both equal to me.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Chrysalis: Everyday /).(\
<SpadeKyruem[School]> No upgrades? Than what the fuck are the hearts
<AJIsHaunter> Platformers=RPGs, IMO.
<Michael> Moo ^o^
*SuperBrony64 noms on cookeh
<Chrysalis> did you ever find clothes SuperBrony64?
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], you mean those battle that can be avoid? since there's no use to play them at all?
<Chrysalis> hmmm, wonder if the cookie server is up
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Chrysalis: Umm...yesh? o.o
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], the hearts are items
*AssaultWithEmbraces boops SuperBrony64 with a pillow :3
<Bronysith> Christ, this minerva girl in Animaniacs must attract or convert alot of people into furrydom
<Buytoast> that was one thing that annoyed me about sticker star alot
<SpadeKyruem[School]> The hp ups dumbass
<Ryunosuke> i dont think mario necissarily = platformer
<CrystalPhoenix> not upgrade per experiance
<pony_3045> Sindri Sparkle?
<Buytoast> you didnt need to fight anything
<CrystalPhoenix> you have to FIND them
*SuperBrony64 is booped /)u(\
<CrystalPhoenix> not earning them by experiance
<SpadeKyruem[School]> They arent that fucking hard to find
<Buytoast> you could just avoid the enemies and still beat the game
<SpadeKyruem[School]> And boo hoo you cant level up.. DEAL WITH IT
*AdamTheDuck still wonders what cooking a whole batch of cookie dough in a cake tray will end out
<Ryunosuke> mario rpg/paper mario, Dr Mario, Mario Party, Super Smash Bros.
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], and what about the partners
<Buytoast> what's the point of putting enemies ina game if there is no reason to fight them?
<CrystalPhoenix> where are they
<SpadeKyruem[School]> You try something new and peopel always fuckign bitch
<AdamTheDuck> One giant cookie cake. I want to try that some day :3
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Never fails
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AdamTheDuck, a cookie cake or cake cookie thing
<AJIsHaunter> AdamTheDuck: Now that you say that, I wonder what that would be like too. :D
<Buytoast> the problem is they didn't need to do anything new for paper mario
<Ryunosuke> those are all good mario games that are not platformers
<Buytoast> they just screwed it up
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Still better than Super
<pony_3045> it's dangerous to go alone take this http://cdn.zoopicture.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/blobfish_2.jpg
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64: remember http://i.imgur.com/TgGKxh.jpg
<AdamTheDuck> AssaultWithEmbraces, it cna be whatever it is, once I tried it XD
<Buytoast> so?
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/d2Rmx.png
<Buytoast> who cares if it's better than super
<Buytoast> doesn't mean it's a good paper mario game
<Bronysith> you know america is fat when the thing people are scared of is called a "slender man"
<CrystalPhoenix> it's still not a Paper Mario game
<Buytoast> just means its a shineri piece of shit
<CrystalPhoenix> ALSO
<SpadeKyruem[School]> I love how no one gives a shit about super having no element from the first two paper games
*AssaultWithEmbraces pokes AdamTheDuck :>
<CrystalPhoenix> THE STORY
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Chrysalis: Yesh O.O
<CrystalPhoenix> The story is non-existant
*AdamTheDuck licks AssaultWithEmbraces :3
<Buytoast> fuck, Bowser didn't even speak
<Ryunosuke> Also, Super Mario Bros. 2 (US)
*SuperBrony64 glomps AdamTheDuck
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Right...because people play games for story
<Ryunosuke> need I say more? :)
<Buytoast> they took the story out CrystalPhoenix
<CrystalPhoenix> granted I haven't finished the game but yeah
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 saw the decent nights sleep in the idle stream
*AdamTheDuck boops SuperBrony64 nose :3
<Buytoast> miyamoto said they didn;t need a story
<CrystalPhoenix> the story is nowhere
<AdamTheDuck> *Boop* :3
<Chrysalis> and getting all nostalgic
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Erm...so he didnt speak...he never spoke in the regular series anyway
<Chrysalis> so started lookin through my imgur :P
<CrystalPhoenix> Buytoast, well where's the motivation then
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Chrysalis: What's that?
<Buytoast> he spoke in the papaer mario series
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], you're kidding
*SuperBrony64 noms on AdamTheDuck
<Buytoast> why do you think people are pissed he didn;t talk this time
<Buytoast> they shat all over papaer mario
*thelonecubone|DI pooks AdamTheDuck and SuperBrony64 :3
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Besides you only run into the fucker at the end, what would he even say
<Chrysalis> image hosting
<CrystalPhoenix> He spoke ever since Mario 64
*SuperBrony64 is pooked O.O
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Naked man jailed for climbing, biting London statue
<CrystalPhoenix> and a paper mario without a story?
<CrystalPhoenix> then what's the game?
<Buytoast> he doesn't even say anything at the beginning
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Again..most people play games and ignore the story
<Buytoast> wow
<Buytoast> you are terrible
<CrystalPhoenix> cause paper mario was known for its brilliant writting as well
<SpadeKyruem[School]> I played through it and I never gave a shit
<thelonecubone|DI> Gonna kill myself some zombies :3
*SuperBrony64 hugs Derpy_at_work
<Chrysalis> SpadeKyruem[School] thats because most games have no story
<thelonecubone|DI> >:3*
<Buytoast> and you're the reasom people are making crappier games
<AJIsHaunter> thelonecubone|DI: Good luck! :3
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Im not nitpicky about every fucking detai;
<Chrysalis> or its appalling
<Ryunosuke> all we need now is a mario strategy game like FFT :)
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], though I can say it may be a cool idea and all but calling it Paper Mario is a sell-out
<Buytoast> it's not a terrible game
<Buytoast> but it's horrible to call it a paper mario game
<Derpy_at_work> who's streaming?
<SpadeKyruem[School]> <.<
<CrystalPhoenix> exactly
<VenHur> What game we're talking about?
<Buytoast> sticker star
<CrystalPhoenix> Paper Mario Sticker Star
<Michael> Derpy_at_work: nobody :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Best Paper Mario game was The Thousand Year Door.
<AJIsHaunter> Derpy_at_work: No one atm.
<Buytoast> yes
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, THANK YOU
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Its still more a paper mario game than Super paper mario
<CrystalPhoenix> Yes
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: Oh, I LOVED that game.
<Buytoast> thousand year door was the pinnacle
<VenHur> SuperBrony64: Oh hi, you silly pony.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek silleh :3c
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Ok I have to admit thusand eyar door was great
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], it's better than Sticker Star
<Buytoast> super paper mario at least had a story and DIALOGUE
<SpadeKyruem[School]> I really need to play that again
<DinkyDoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_hKLfTKU5Y
<SpadeKyruem[School]> but the fucking game play sucked
<VenHur> SuperBrony64: I liked all four of them, yes, even Super Paper Mario...that game made me cry...
<CrystalPhoenix> brilliant writing, great gameplay, nice badge system
<SpadeKyruem[School]> IT tries ot be a god damn platformer and a rpg
<CrystalPhoenix> oh what now
<VenHur> SuperBrony64: Espectially its story.
<CrystalPhoenix> Thousand years door?
<CrystalPhoenix> wat?
<Buytoast> you were just saying how the gameplay of sticker star was like the old papeer marios
<SpadeKyruem[School]> and the rpg in super paper is non exsistant
<Michael> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn-_sDp-OBI
<Buytoast> and now you're saying game play in 1000 year door sucks?
<VenHur> I never understand why the backlash on Super Paper Mario, it wasn't THAT bad.
<Buytoast> make up your damn mind
<SpadeKyruem[School]> No im talking about super
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: I didn't mind the game.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Stormy http://www.polygon.com/2012/12/4/3726118/pokemon-gold-and-silver-recreated-in-first-person-3d-by-indie
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Super got boring quick for me...
<VenHur> As for Sticker Star, it's alright!
<CrystalPhoenix> Super Paper Mario had one great thing
<CrystalPhoenix> the story
<SpadeKyruem[School]> The gameplay was pretty lacking
<Buytoast> people didn't like super too much because it strayed from the rpg ways
<VenHur> They were trying something different...
<pony_3045> sombody make something with juggling twilight
<Buytoast> and people don't like sticker star because it took the rpg ways and destroyed them until you got some crappy mush that they said was a papaer mario game
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Super paper was a platformer trying to be a rpg
<CrystalPhoenix> I get that
<CrystalPhoenix> but Sticker is nothing like an RPG
<VenHur> They tryed to go for a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night-ish style for Super Paper Mario, but it's still counts as an RPG.
<CCharmanderK> HEY GUYS WHAT'S GOING O- oh, the stream is off.
<CrystalPhoenix> at all
<SpadeKyruem[School]> I still found Sticker more interesting thatn Super
<Michael> hai CCharmanderK , not much :)
<VenHur> Guys, stop giving Sticker Star a bad name! I mean, geesh, it's not Luigi's Mansion!
<CCharmanderK> So...
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: I liked Luigi's Mansion. :S
<Buytoast> Luigi's Mansion was good
<CrystalPhoenix> Sticker Star is a cool concept it might be a great game
<CrystalPhoenix> ....in itself
<VenHur> Me too, man... :S
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Ok I see your point
<CCharmanderK> Luigi's Mansion was a great game. It gets too much shit from the peanut gallery.
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Its not the same as thousand
<CrystalPhoenix> why did they need to name it Paper Mario
<SpadeKyruem[School]> But its a good game by itself
<Buytoast> because papaer mario sells games
<Buytoast> i cant spell paper
<CrystalPhoenix> it just very insulting
<pony_3045> cdi games was da best
<CrystalPhoenix> it's like nuts and bolts
<Buytoast> yes it is
<Buytoast> insulting
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Oh god nuts and bolts
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Fuck that game
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], See what we mean
<SpadeKyruem[School]> But I still say its a good game regardless
<Buytoast> people aren't hating too much on the game itself
<CrystalPhoenix> we were promised a Paper Mario game
<VenHur> Crystal, stop bashing Paper Mario Sticker Star and go play something else, like Pac-Man for the Atari 2600.
<CCharmanderK> You know what game needs more love?
<Buytoast> just labeling it as a paper mario game
<SpadeKyruem[School]> But yea..its not a paper mario game in the sense
<CrystalPhoenix> we got something entirely different
<AJIsHaunter> CCharmanderK: What?
<SpadeKyruem[School]> But again its a fun game...to me anyway
<CCharmanderK> TinStar for SNES.
<twixie_sprinkle> italian plummers r srs bsns
<Buytoast> well yeah it's pretty fun
<pony_3045> shit my second hdd just ded
<CrystalPhoenix> VenHur, have I said it was a complete horrible game
<Buytoast> but shitty as a paper mario game
<Michael> Gnight everypony, gotta rest for tomorrow :)
<GoldenMic> what is this
<AJIsHaunter> Night, Michael. :)
<BladedWings> nite Michael
<twixie_sprinkle> bye Michael
<VenHur> Nite Michael.
<BladedWings> hi GoldenMic
<GoldenMic> hi.
<pony_3045> after some sector a solid wall of bad blocks
<CCharmanderK> Lemme guess, no-one here has heard of or played TinStar before.
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Needs more Battletoads
<VenHur> It's 3:56 here in Mexico.
<GoldenMic> ihas
<BladedWings> CCharmanderK: i feel like i have heard of it before...just not clicking right now :$
<GoldenMic> its the middle of school here in 'laska
<CCharmanderK> 9_9
<GoldenMic> >_> Doing my work...
<Stormy> o.o cool
<pony_3045> it's middle of night here
<Bronysith> http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/37166330716
<BladedWings> GoldenMic: like everyone else here :D
<VenHur> I remember Battletoads, but no one seems to know about Battlemaniacs, the crossover game with Double Dragon, or the arcade game that had blood.
<VenHur> Lots and lots of them.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> oh my fucking god, I think I'm having deja vu AGAIN
<Spyrorocks[Air]> i thought before i read it that 3d pokemon would be stupud
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: How so?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> stupid
<Bronysith> AssaultWithEmbraces: happens to me everyday
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but it actually kind of works.
<CCharmanderK> I love this song, AND the anime it accompanies: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IETQ63aTdNM
<SpadeKyruem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxCAqVsbxCU Go go Luigi's mansion theme!
<Ryunosuke> Bronysith: oh mai
<CrystalPhoenix> VenHur, I remember that game
<pony_3045> molestia strikes again
<BladedWings> VenHur: i liked battletoads...and i think i remember Battlemaniacs XD
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdMhTL5bZrs one of the best final boss themes EVER
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, so how was the ending
<Bronysith> CrystalPhoenix: i dont know, havent seen it yet
<VenHur> There WAS a Battletoads cartoon, but it never made it past the pilot episode.
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: is that server still going?
<SpadeKyruem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zdR6KPW1f4
<BladedWings> AssaultWithEmbraces: what deja vu are you having?
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, you haven't beat the final boss yet?
*Saturn 08,01looks at his work, looks at the minecraft executable, looks back at his work
<Saturn> 08,01goddamnit...
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, I'm searching something on Reddit and I'm watching the food network and suddenly I get this weird feeling in my mind and it's like "omg this has already happened but it didn't"
<GoldenMic> This math program lacks ponies... and a comfirmation button
<SpadeKyruem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiE3Jhtd85A Needs more Live and Learn
<BladedWings> AssaultWithEmbraces: happens to me all the time :D
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Easy As Pie
<CrystalPhoenix> Another brilliant Final boss theme http://youtu.be/Ckxy-i7Dc5U
<SpadeKyruem[School]> CrystalPhoenix: Oh god FUCK YES
<twixie_sprinkle> bayonetta has some awesome boss themes
<AJIsHaunter> CrystalPhoenix: Have you battled the Shroobs hidden in the game?
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsHaunter, I gotta admit I haven't played the game personally
<VenHur> Anyone that wants to see the Battletoads pilot episode, here is it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggmOeBnbyXI
<Bronysith> RPGs usually have awesome music, final fantasy is a huge example, as well as chrono trigger and persona series
<CrystalPhoenix> for me persona is all about BABYBABYBABY
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: So many Surfer vibes. :D
<BladedWings> Bronysith: oh of course lol, love FF's music
<pony_3045> i thing FF was boring
<DrawMotherbucker> So boromir, what's your comment on the upcoming episode?
<SpadeKyruem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdIFaHFHkpM
<DrawMotherbucker> Boromir: One does not simply sleep in ponyville
<CrystalPhoenix> also it's pretty simple actually
<CrystalPhoenix> in RPG especially on final boss the music is supposed to make you feel pump up
<Yahooz> DrawMotherbucker: one does not simply do spoilers in bronystate :p
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Random note, I think Black White/Black white 2's elite 4 theme is the best in the series
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, I love RPG music.
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<Bronysith> waitaminute
<AJIsHaunter> I haven't played Black 2 yet.
<Bronysith> Shadow of the colossus has the best sound track EVER
<DrawMotherbucker> HAY BACON STRIPS
<pony_3045> BACON!
<SpadeKyruem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2ehDtwFR34
<Bronysith> sausage>bacon
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Needs more final fantasy
<pony_3045> BACON TREE
<TheGentleManBrony> I used to think that too Bronysith
<AJIsHaunter> Bacon=Sausage, IMO.
<Buytoast> but bacon is better
<Buytoast> how can you be so wrong
<Bronysith> nah
<twixie_sprinkle> nuuuu have my music playlist videos have been deleted, confound you copyright laws!
<GilDash> AJIsHaunter: Too true.
<Bronysith> Sausage is much better
<TheGentleManBrony> AJIsHaunter: that's actually technically true.
<AdamTheDuck> TheGentleManBrony, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8368/
<CrystalPhoenix> though I remember this song pumping me up to no end http://youtu.be/lIuvjG3Egjo
<twixie_sprinkle> i like sausages more than bacon
<Buytoast> sausage is for people whose taste buds can't handle the food of the gods
<Buytoast> i pity you
<Kjakings> 7I need to stop watching ME3 death scenes on youtube.
<CrystalPhoenix> dat goddamn violin
<SpadeKyruem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozx5p3tbxAg Go go Final Fantasy 6 boss theme!
<TheGentleManBrony> AdamTheDuck, nice
<Bronysith> Bacon is overrated
<twixie_sprinkle> ^
<TheGentleManBrony> I change my nickname like every 3 days on here.
<SpadeKyruem[School]> CrystalPhoenix: Galaxy 2's was good but the boss fight...eh
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: Blame society.
<Bronysith> TheGentleManBrony: to continue ban evading?
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter: blame society videos?
<AJIsHaunter> That and Epic Meal Time.
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], this is galaxy 1 I'm talking about
<TheGentleManBrony> No.
<pony_3045> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKj3NamQNqs
<SpadeKyruem[School]> CrystalPhoenix: I know
<TheGentleManBrony> Because my taste just keeps constantly changing.
<CrystalPhoenix> then don't talk about the second one
<CrystalPhoenix> even though the final boss in the first game was pretty meh as well
<SpadeKyruem[School]> At least the first had somewhat of a challenge
<CrystalPhoenix> though it did pump me up to max
<SpadeKyruem[School]> 2 was just slam meteors and win
<Stormy> Not to beat a dead horse or anything, but the end of that game really did suck
<CrystalPhoenix> so the final phase was really meh
<TheGentleManBrony> I originally used to my real name, and then I switched to AmericanTeaDrinker because I was on a tea bender, and then GottaHugEmAll because everyone else was doing a Pokemon nick, then DrawMotherbucker because I had no ideas but I wanted to change my nickname, and now I'm on this one.
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah I kinda agree that they could've done something else for that
<SpadeKyruem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu3hFJsTuok But god damn I loved the music for it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Refresh embed everyone :)
<CrystalPhoenix> but the final battle was pretty much the same as the other battles except with a bit more of difficulty
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Oh hai twitch
*AdamTheDuck licks SuperBrony64 :3
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, you're not using Ustream?
*SuperBrony64 licks AdamTheDuck back :3
<twixie_sprinkle> twitchy twitcha twitch
<CrystalPhoenix> I thought Ustream was great for videogames
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrystalPhoenix: No, I use Twitch for Gameplay
<SpadeKyruem[School]> I have my Mario Galaxy cd lying around here somewhere
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, why?
<alexxm|foal> how've you been AdamTheDuck
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyruem[School], I got the soundtrack of the second game :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrystalPhoenix: Because I forced to use it with my capture card.
<AJIsHaunter> Galaxy was a blast to play. Galaxy 2 felt somewhat underwhelming, for some reason.
<Derpy_Hooves> SuperBrony64 \:3/
<Bronysith> shadow of the colossus has the greatest video game soundtrack ever
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm|foal, great on this lovely morning, just sipping on some lovely coffee. :3 You?
<SpadeKyruem[School]> I sort of enjoyed Galaxy 2
*AdamTheDuck uses the word lovely too much
<TheGentleManBrony> So who is streaming this montage?
<thelonecubone|DI> ohai Derpy_Hooves :)
<CrystalPhoenix> I didn't understand a single thing in your sentence
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Derpy_Hooves :P
<CrystalPhoenix> forced in what term
<SpadeKyruem[School]> The challange seemed a tad toned down in 2 from 1
<alexxm|foal> how've you been Derpy_Hooves
<alexxm|foal> i'm good AdamTheDuck
<CrystalPhoenix> HOLY SHIT
<CrystalPhoenix> BEST GAME
<AJIsHaunter> THIS GAME :O
<Derpy_Hooves> what game?
<AJIsHaunter> Derpy_Hooves: Paper Mario: The Thousand Year DOor. :)
<CrystalPhoenix> inb4 SuperBrony64 gets bored and play BLOPS 2
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm bored, let's play CoD
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: No! :<
<pony_4507> loading the justin.tv player in a frame is not allowed
<Boltasar> that was long SuperBrony64
<pony_4507> dang it
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64, XD
<SuperBrony64> 11,02pony_4507: Yeah, you can't use Chrome to view within the embed.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> http://i.imgur.com/Ekkh0.jpg
<pony_4507> hold on its me glennglog22 gonna change name
<SpadeKyruem[School]> admittingly I played the shit out of Thousand Year door
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: My audio and video's stuttering.
<CrystalPhoenix> I need to play this game again
<CrystalPhoenix> sooooo good
<TheGentleManBrony> I would like some coffee.
<SpadeKyruem[School]> I still have my disc in good condtition
<TheGentleManBrony> Can I have some coffee AdamTheDuck?
<AJIsHaunter> I still need to get all the badges and recipes.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsHaunter: Better now?
<SpadeKyruem[School]> I have had that thing for years
<CrystalPhoenix> I remember I was stuck for a loooooong time against Mario
*AdamTheDuck pours coffee onto the ground in front of TheGentleManBrony >:3
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: Sorry, no. It's still the same problem. :<
<SpadeKyruem[School]> I still own my N64 cart for Paper mario as well
<AdamTheDuck> Why do I feel so evil this morning? :$
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Anyone else having issues with stream?
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: Don't worry about it, though. Just go ahead. :D
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64, hmm, seems fine on my end
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'll drop the quality some more
<CrystalPhoenix> well except for the weird ratio I'm fine
<CrystalPhoenix> like it look squished
<PaperSpade[R]> Lol
*Bronysith glomps SuperBrony64
*SuperBrony64 hugs Bronysith back :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Better now?
<MadSurge> AJIsHaunter: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/16a84339985ab2e6f18482a64d588549.png so fluffy!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MadSurge: /)^3^(\
<CrystalPhoenix> still squishy
<Squishy> what
<CrystalPhoenix> oh lawl
<PaperSpade[R]> Is mario's email the intor tune to world?
<CrystalPhoenix> I meant the stream quality
<PaperSpade[R]> I knew I heard that before
<BladedWings> MadSurge: daaaaaw fluffy!
<AJIsHaunter> MadSurge: So Fluffy!
<PaperSpade[R]> I never could place it when I played Door
<AJIsHaunter> PaperSpade[R]: Yep.
<PaperSpade[R]> Maybe because I never let it play the whole way
<PaperSpade[R]> I usualy answered right away so maybe thats why
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Aspect ratio looks fine
<AJIsHaunter> In some cases, it would play the introduction to the game when you start up the new file.
<pony_3045> The Brick Frog!
<AJIsHaunter> But only for some e-mails.
<PaperSpade[R]> Also I wonder if Birdo will ever be in a "canon" mario game
<PaperSpade[R]> Oh god dat battle theme
<CrystalPhoenix> oh another thing about Sticker Star
<CrystalPhoenix> you cannot choose who to hit
<PaperSpade[R]> That sort of bugged me but I never got bothered by it too much
<CrystalPhoenix> just another thing to add to the reason of why it can't be a Paper Mario game
<Pinkie_Clone> hello
<CrystalPhoenix> cause that kinda removed some strategy aspect
<PaperSpade[R]> Thats being a bit picky though...
<PaperSpade[R]> I never really uses that much strategy in paper mario from what I remember, I just destroyed everything in my path
<PaperSpade[R]> *used
<Kjakings> 7That's like saying not to beat a dead horse or anything, but terraria is really like minecraft
<Kjakings> 7not to beat a dead horse or anything, EA are douches
<Stormy> lol
<Kjakings> 7not to beat a dead horse or anything, ubisoft have terrible DRM
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], or maybe that's kinda automatic thinking for you
<PaperSpade[R]> Then again...its been like ...what.. 2 years since I played Thousand year door last
<Kjakings> 7not to beat a dead horse or anything, this place is kinda dead
<PaperSpade[R]> CrystalPhoenix: again I havent played door in about 2 years so my memory may be foggy
<CrystalPhoenix> since there are enemies that have priorities
<Stormy> I'm afraid I don't get half your references
<Kjakings> 7not to beat a dead horse or anything, spyro as a franchise is swiftly unravelling
<jcelios> "Loading the Justin.tv player in a frame is not allowed."?
<Kjakings> 7not to beat a dead horse or anything, BioWare generally have good storytelling in games
<pony_3045> twilight should juggling with over ponies
<Kjakings> 7not to beat a dead horse or anything, racism is bad.
<Stormy> Not to beat a dead horse or anything, but I get it already, sheesh
<Stormy> :P
<Kjakings> 7Oh good because I was running out
<Spyrorocks[Air]> not to beat a dead horse or anything.. but
*Spyrorocks[Air] beats dead horse
<PaperSpade[R]> Goombario/goombella is kinda usless when you get to spiked foes
<pony_3045> for Celestia pleasure
<PaperSpade[R]> I usually only used them for tattles and swapped out
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], http://derpy.me/dGofG Hello
<twixie_sprinkle> jcelios: it doesnt work with chrome on this page, you need to copy link into another rab
<twixie_sprinkle> *tab
<PaperSpade[R]> CrystalPhoenix: Oh god those fuckers
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], also don't underestimate Goombario
*Stormy makes a clever reference about MLP characters
<Kjakings> 7Anyway. Yes, the ending sucked. Yes, from a lore point of view the re-purposing of starchild generally made it better and, in my opinion, made it an acceptable plot point however it was still incredibly cheap, felt cut short, and didn't have half of the features that it should've, or that we were promised.
<CrystalPhoenix> if you can charge that boss of a partner enough you can kill a boss so easily
<PaperSpade[R]> In the first game I ususally had Watt always out or Sushi, or Bow
<pony_3045> guys
<Pinkie_Clone> hello MLP_Brovakiin
<pony_3045> guys
<PaperSpade[R]> Good old Watt
<CrystalPhoenix> Watt is overrated
<Spyrorocks[Air]> That looked like it should have made sense, but it didn't.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Pinkie_Clone :)
<pony_3045> who remember this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oE8PhNMjqM?
<Kjakings> 7The entire other 90% of the game though was fantastic and provided meaningful conclusions to storylines spanning the entire trilogy, and I wish everyone would shut the fuck up about the ending because jesus fucking christ who even cares any more
<AdamTheDuck> pony_3045, no non-image links during streams please.
<pony_3045> no stream
<MadSurge> There's a stream, refresh
<BladedWings> yes there is
<CrystalPhoenix> and I can see that SuperBrony64 still doesn't B counter
<pony_3045> oh!
<AdamTheDuck> pony_3045, refresh.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Please no YouTube links during stream pony_3045 :)
<pony_3045> i see it now
<CrystalPhoenix> B counter is OP
<pony_3045> thanks
<PaperSpade[R]> Do the species like that one that held watt hostage even have a name?
<Chrysalis> oooh stream?
<PaperSpade[R]> I called them sheet ghosts
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: Paper Mario :D
<AJIsHaunter> Oh, I LOVED Counterattacking in TTYD.
<Stormy> Not me, I didn't even play the game most of the way through :P
<Stormy> I just watched Lambda play it
<Chrysalis> oh... thanks sb
<CrystalPhoenix> no like seriously
<PaperSpade[R]> You have to be good on timing to use counters effectivly
<Stormy> Hi Afflict
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], of course
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Hi Afflac.
<Afflict> hey
<CrystalPhoenix> but when mastered
<PaperSpade[R]> I barley used countering because I was kinda shit with it
<PaperSpade[R]> You cant be touched?
<AJIsHaunter> I also love the music as you approach the TTYD.
<XAX> SuperBrony64: Isn't the final boss, or one of the bosses in this game, kind of disturbing? apparently...
<CrystalPhoenix> B counter can pretty much make you cruise into the game without any damage
<AJIsHaunter> XAX: You'll see.
<Afflict> how you guys doing?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02XAX: Probably :P
<CrystalPhoenix> since it counters EVERYTHING
<Stormy> We're beating dead horses apparently :P
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Horse != pony
<CrystalPhoenix> XAX quite
<pony_3045> Maniac Mansion theme just so awesome
<CrystalPhoenix> but no spoiler
<PaperSpade[R]> Glitzpitt time?
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], unfortunately
<PaperSpade[R]> Oh wait... thats later
<PaperSpade[R]> I fucking love the Glitzpit
<PaperSpade[R]> Best part of the game
<Kjakings> 7also Javik is best squadpony
<CrystalPhoenix> what I LOVED about Paper Mario is that not only is there a main story
<PaperSpade[R]> Sub plot?
<CrystalPhoenix> but there's a story in each place you visit
<CrystalPhoenix> yes
<Stormy> we didn't get that DLC
<XAX> CrystalPhoenix: Because I remember watching a video on top [number here] most disturbing bosses, and i'm sure a paper mario boss was in it somewhere.
<PaperSpade[R]> That fucker of a guard is still there?
<PaperSpade[R]> I suspect Super payed him
<DinkyDoo> ''Loading the Justin.tv player in a frame that is not allowed.'' What does that mean?
<Kjakings> 7I didn't even buy the game, so I kinda got both for free :P
<AJIsHaunter> Blocking allows a certain amount of frames to go by before you have to push the A button. Countering is the same thing, but you're allowed to give dmage and not take any at the cost of not having a lot of frames to work with in terms of blocking, IIRC.
<PaperSpade[R]> Oh god the punis look adoranle
<Stormy> lol that works I guess
<PaperSpade[R]> *adorable
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DinkyDoo: You have to either use a non-Chrome browser or go to the link provided.
<AJIsHaunter> *damage
<DinkyDoo> Oh.
<PaperSpade[R]> I do like the game gives you the tattle info for anybosses you didnt use it on in the trash
<PaperSpade[R]> Thats kinda nice I suppose
<AJIsHaunter> I actually filled out my tattle log. :$
<PaperSpade[R]> I did too
<pony_3045> it's a me! Mario!
<Kjakings> 7I got really happy when I realised that both Javik and Tali have black and gold coloured armour so I can colour-coordinate my entire squad.
<BladedWings> lol SuperBrony64
<PaperSpade[R]> Weegee!
<PaperSpade[R]> Mah man!
<AJIsHaunter> Oh man, I LOVED Luigi's stories in this game. :D
<pony_3045> we gotta find some princess
<PaperSpade[R]> I dont know how good it would be but I would pay to play a Luigi side story of his adventure
<pony_3045> and fuck zem
<AJIsHaunter> I actually bought all the books and read them. :D
<PaperSpade[R]> Luigi's last partner is weird
<PaperSpade[R]> You NEVER find anything like it in the game aside from him
<AJIsHaunter> The music in the train ride is FANTASTIC.
<pony_3045> i cant read that fast
<CrystalPhoenix> see why can't we have this instead
<Kjakings> 7it also /vaguely/ works with Garrus but not much
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I want to make a pony crossing sign and replace the deer crossing sign along my road with it.
<PaperSpade[R]> Is mario falling asleep during tales a running gag or something?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> make it look real though haha.
<DinkyDoo> Chesnut king.
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], yes
<PaperSpade[R]> If I recall he's only been caught once
<AJIsHaunter> PaperSpade[R]: It's supposed to bore him. :D
<Kjakings> 7SR, where do you fall on the idea that the whole 'next level of study' thing for Twilight is her becoming an alicorn?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I don't read that far into the series.
<PaperSpade[R]> Is it just me or does Merlon's stache get more and more grand each game?
<pony_3045> use shell
<AJIsHaunter> I have no idea. But I LOVE his moustache.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> But if I did, I would say that ponies are born the way they are, and don't "transform".
<PaperSpade[R]> Also I love how a majority of Mario's partners are chicks
<PaperSpade[R]> Mario gets all the ladies
<Stormy> it seems like that's what they're trying to imply, but I don't see how they could do it
<AJIsHaunter> Did anyone ever use Chet Rippo's skills in this game? :D
<AJIsHaunter> I never did.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> so I don't think she will "become" an alicorn, but its possible through some magic or something that she will become one temporarily.
<pony_3045> i mustach the question
<Stormy> Twilight would be too overpowered as a main character
<PaperSpade[R]> What does Chet do again?
<Kjakings> 7Twilight is already way too OP
<Spyrorocks[Air]> for some sort of mission.
<Stormy> So they'd have to replace her with someone else or end the show
<pony_3045> mario a pimp
<AJIsHaunter> PaperSpade[R]: He buffs one stat at the cost of lowering another, if I recall.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Maybe if we keep buying the merchandise they will keep making the show.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I gauge the cost of one episode to around $650,000
<pony_3045> woo
<BladedWings> What up with that Pain badge lol
<AJIsHaunter> Is the "Double Pain" badge ever useful?
<Stormy> o.o damn
<PaperSpade[R]> Also is it a rumor or can you actually get stuck on the level up selection in the first paper game?
<AJIsHaunter> I've never found a use for it.
<Kjakings> 7also you're objecting to the concept of simply plonking wings on a creature - a unicorn no less - where the sun and moon are controlled by living deities. But only in certain parts of the world. and you doubt that there is a spell to turn permanently give a unicorn wings?
<AJIsHaunter> PaperSpade[R]: I actually hear you can.
<CrystalPhoenix> and I suspect that SuperBrony64 isn't doing a BP run
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Didn't you learn anything from magic duel?
<PaperSpade[R]> Seinor stompy AWAY!
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Such spells are impossible :P
<RainbowDerpy> stepped on wat
<Kjakings> 7That /Twilight/ has her limits.
<AJIsHaunter> RainbowDerpy: Contact lens.
<RainbowDerpy> oh
<PaperSpade[R]> Bitch needs glasses
<Spyrorocks[Air]> But really, we are debating a show where ponies talk.
<CrystalPhoenix> just go get Rarity
<Spyrorocks[Air]> so I suppose they can do whatever they want.
<CrystalPhoenix> she must have some leftover contact lenses
<Stormy> but but, it was the _alicorn_ amulet
<Ryunosuke> Mushroom RAGE
<Stormy> so maybe only alicorns can do that stuff
<pony_3045> spy mouse
<Stormy> but true :P
<Ryunosuke> see her mushroom rage
<CrystalPhoenix> THIS MOUSE
<PaperSpade[R]> does that dog thing ever have a species name?
<Kjakings> 7and impossible for her /so far/. She hasn't been studying that long - the Princesses have had a thousand years (at least) to fuck around and figure shit out.
<CrystalPhoenix> Fund him
<CrystalPhoenix> no really fund him
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I don't think they actually laid out "groundwork" where rules exist for the ponyverse.
<RainbowDerpy> im just gunna say it GREEEEEEEEENNN!
<PaperSpade[R]> FUND HIM EVERYTHING
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: Give him as MUCH moeny as you can.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> whats possible and whats not.
<pony_3045> 12 oz mouse
<PaperSpade[R]> He pays you double later
<Kjakings> 7well, we know that Celestia controls the sun and moon in Equestria, but not the everfree forest. which is kind of impressive in itself
<Stormy> that's actually pretty dangerous when writers do that
<DinkyDoo> He just took all your money.
<Saturn> 08,01☭
<AJIsHaunter> PaperSpade[R]: Triple, IIRC.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> Hoy Saturn
<AJIsHaunter> Saturn: ?
<PaperSpade[R]> The fuck is that?
<CrystalPhoenix> and yeah Triple
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Saturn, what?
<GilDash> Is that a Hammer and Sickel?
<Stormy> in a little cartoon like this probably not so much
<GilDash> Yeah, it is.
<BladedWings> wow Saturn ....that a hammer ans sickle?
<GilDash> Da fuq? XD
<twixie_sprinkle> Saturn: COMMIE
<Saturn> 08,01is it a bird?
<Saturn> 08,01is it a plane?
<BladedWings> *and
<Shizuka> 13no
<DinkyDoo> DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
<RainbowDerpy> COMMUNISM
<Shizuka> 13it's SCIEEEEEEEEEEEEENCE
<AJIsHaunter> I'm using lightIRC, so I see a garbled mess.
<Stormy> But I've seen shows where things get really weird because there are basically no rules in the universe
<Saturn> 08,01is it Saturn being a pinko commie?
<RainbowDerpy> BETTER DEAD THAN RED
<PaperSpade[R]> CrystalPhoenix: Admittingly one thing I didnt like about Sticker star is the fact they make the characters aware they're paper
<Shizuka> 13no you are a yellow commie
<Kjakings> 7It just amuses me that you object to the concept of turning Twi into an alicorn through magic when such insane magical feats are already cannon
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Its almost like, the simpsons had a sort of rule where certain things could happen and make sense in their earlier seasons
<DashWithRainbows> I bet it was the second option.
<Shizuka> 13i am the pink commie
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SCIENCE
<pony_3045> COMMUNISM HO!
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but the later season, like season 19+, they broke anything they created.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> its all suck.
<AJIsHaunter> Saturn: So what is the symbol you typed? I'm using lightiRC, so it looks like garbled mess.
<pony_3045> utf
<Ryunosuke> ohai Shizuka
*Shizuka 13yawns
<Saturn> 08,01once i tried to ☭ but i accidentally 卐
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Stormy the bad thing happens when you "think" you know the rules, and a new episode shatters that.
<CrystalPhoenix> ☭
<CrystalPhoenix> that's what it looked like
<Spyrorocks[Air]> inconsistancies.
<PaperSpade[R]> AJIsHaunter: If you look closely but you can make out a hammer sickle
<pony_3045> utf has all the answers
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/EqR5w.jpg
*Ryunosuke pops a milk ball dud in Shizuka's mouth :p
<AJIsHaunter> PaperSpade[R]: I think I see it now.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> But as always, go back to what it is at its core… a kids show with magic talking ponies.
<PaperSpade[R]> Shizuka: Da fuck
<pony_3045> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<CrystalPhoenix> AW SHIIII COUNTER
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: Nice counter! :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: Haha
<PaperSpade[R]> How high can you level up the stage?
<Stormy> that's definitely bad too
<DinkyDoo> JUUUUUUUUUUMP!
<PaperSpade[R]> I only leveled it up like twice
<AJIsHaunter> PaperSpade[R]: Pretty high, actually.
<PaperSpade[R]> Mine had like blue curtans
<AJIsHaunter> I think up to 200+ people?
<Cypresswolf> :3 reminds me of every camping trip I've been on
<CrystalPhoenix> needs more Stylish
<PaperSpade[R]> Not sure how high that is
<Saturn> 08,01卐卐卐卐卐 HAPPY DIWALI 卐卐卐卐卐
<pony_3045> jump
<Saturn> 08,01better late than never.
<CrystalPhoenix> D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
<AJIsHaunter> One of my favorite styles moves were the hammer moves.
<PaperSpade[R]> Also one time I swore Luigi tossed a rock at me once
<Cypresswolf> Only 1 bathroom and always at the opposite end of the campgrounds :D
<AJIsHaunter> Daww, so cute! <3
<DinkyDoo> Don't eat meeeee!
<Stormy> I just recently finished watching the TV show Angel which basically has a universe where there are spells for pretty much everything
<PaperSpade[R]> Why are the puni's so adorable?
<CrystalPhoenix> Pikmin soon
<Kjakings> 7It concerns me that this is going to be a very Twi-centric season.
<AJIsHaunter> Although, the music gets somewhat annoying when you have to listen to it for about an hour and a half as a kid.
<Stormy> And every episode they bring up completely new lore
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I don't mind twi episodes.
<DinkyDoo> Mean Mario.
<Chrysalis> hai Saturn
<Spyrorocks[Air]> It keeps me entertained.
<Stormy> the second to last season got completely crazy because of that
<PaperSpade[R]> SuperBrony64: You're mean :(
<Stormy> and everyone hated it
<Spyrorocks[Air]> also, my plans got ruined
<Kjakings> 7Yeah, but every episode so far has had her solving the problem through magic. I want episodes that have her as background pony.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> for the season finale i was going to rent that theatre
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but im going to be away most of january
<Spyrorocks[Air]> so wont work.
<Stormy> I've never really liked Twilight all that much
<Shizuka> 13oh this
<Stormy> She annoys me
<Shizuka> 13thousand year door?
<PaperSpade[R]> I dont think you can get that badge till you have Flurry
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Spyrorocks[Air]> The bad part of including such general "magic" themes is that your always like "just use ur magic lol fix that problem"
<PaperSpade[R]> I forgot what it even does
<Spyrorocks[Air]> kind of a cop-out
<Spyrorocks[Air]> :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: Love this game ^-^
<PaperSpade[R]> Does anyone remember?
<Stormy> Yep
<RainbowDerpy> GREEEEEN!
<CrystalPhoenix> CHAPTER 2
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but whatever, I can enjoy the show for its pretty colours.
<CrystalPhoenix> Gosh I miss that
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Its like LSD or something.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> :P
<Stormy> Which is probably why they don't include Celestia and Luna much
<Stormy> lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CHAPTER 2 - THE GREAT BOGGLY TREE
<Shizuka> 13the great googly moogly
<SuperBrony64> 11,02PaperSpade[R]: It decreases damage you take by 1 when you dodge
<PaperSpade[R]> No silouete this time
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: O U
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Id like more Luna episodes.
<CrystalPhoenix> Dat level style
<twixie_sprinkle> google moogley googly moogly NOOOOOO googly moogly
<Spyrorocks[Air]> who voiced Luna in the first episode?
<CrystalPhoenix> so unique and yet eerie
<twixie_sprinkle> i wonder who remembers that
<AskPeachy|NFC> Howdy everypony how are y'all
<Spyrorocks[Air]> why am I thinking Lauren Faust?
<pony_3045> mario got high
<CrystalPhoenix> Aw shit
<twixie_sprinkle> hoi AskPeachy|NFC
<PaperSpade[R]> The environments are really diverse here
<CrystalPhoenix> our favorite sisters tri.....duo?
<BladedWings> Ahh Vivian...i liked her lol
<CrystalPhoenix> BladedWings, her?
<PaperSpade[R]> I was kind of disturbed to find out japan vivi is a DUDE
<Stormy> Apparently it was Tabitha St Germain, same person who does Rarity's voice
<CrystalPhoenix> Lawl
<Spyrorocks[Air]> ah k
<Shizuka> 13i think the last part of this i saw was the wrestling match in the air
<Shizuka> 13back when i had friends
<PaperSpade[R]> Its just...WHY NINTENDO
<Spyrorocks[Air]> All these voice actors live like 40 mins from me.
<PaperSpade[R]> WHY A MALE
<CrystalPhoenix> all in the unique charm of Paper Mario
<Stormy> Now that I think about it I can see that, they do sound similar
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Kind of a funny thought :P
<BladedWings> CrystalPhoenix: i thought the one with a red hat was a girl XD
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: Glitz Pit
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], why not?
<Shizuka> 13that was it
<PaperSpade[R]> Well im confused why she was a male to begin with
<CrystalPhoenix> BladedWings, well of course it give you that impression and america did censored it
<Stormy> I'm sure there are plenty of creepy stalker bronies who would love to live where you live then :P
<Spyrorocks[Air]> haha
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], that's her personal backstory
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Glitz Pit was one of my favorite Chapters from this game.
<PaperSpade[R]> I kind of prefer Vivian to being a female because it creeps me out the way she acts in this game if she was a dude
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Theres this guy who went from the east cost to DHX media in vancouver
<CrystalPhoenix> which makes Vivian ever more interesting
<DinkyDoo> Mustachieod.
<PaperSpade[R]> SuperBrony64: I think it was everyone's favorite
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but didnt have the balls to knock on the door.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> he made a video, I loled.
<Shizuka> 13ITT ponies are weirded out by japanese gender role subversion
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I drive past DHX once or twice a month.
<Stormy> He made a video of being too afraid to knock on a door? XD
<PaperSpade[R]> Well it was kind of jaring... getting used to Vivian as a girl liking her as a character and then finding out she was a dude in japan
<Spyrorocks[Air]> yep lol well it was an office complex building with a buzzer, he didn't go say hi.
<PaperSpade[R]> Kind of threw me for a loop
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], you wouldn't like Poison from Street Fighter then
<BladedWings> oh i love poision :D
<CrystalPhoenix> or Bridget in Guilty Gears
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Id bring cake or something, and if they didn't want it, id eat it there on the steps.
<BladedWings> *Poison
<PaperSpade[R]> MONCHROME!
<Stormy> haha
<Spyrorocks[Air]> But id be sure to buy it from somewhere because no one wants someone's creepy home made stuff, thats just weird.
<PaperSpade[R]> *Mono
<PaperSpade[R]> Is there a pattern to the slot?
<BladedWings> wait Bridget was a guy too...man i am learning everyday :D
<DinkyDoo> BINGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<CrystalPhoenix> BladedWings, yep
<DinkyDoo> Your FP is full!
<PaperSpade[R]> I never played Guilty Gears
<Spyrorocks[Air]> If I see Aleisha ball or andrea libman in vancouver, I would stop them and ask for a photo.
<CrystalPhoenix> you didn't notice from the mugshot just before the battles?
<PaperSpade[R]> Am I the only one who hates Clefts?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Everyone hates Clefts
<Spyrorocks[Air]> actually, I think I have a friend who attends the same school as Michelle whats her name.
<CrystalPhoenix> OH GAWD MY HEART http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/310/8/6/guilty_gear__s_bridget_ponified_by_sevenfates-d5k7ztt.png
<SuperBrony64> 11,02They have way too much Defense
<Spyrorocks[Air]> applebloom voice.
<BladedWings> its bad that Poison was the only one i knew of :D and no CrystalPhoenix since i didnt play with that character much lol
<Spyrorocks[Air]> small world.
<BladedWings> CrystalPhoenix: daaaaaaw
<PaperSpade[R]> So any bets on what color yoshi Super is gonna get?
<CrystalPhoenix> I would wish for Blakc
<CrystalPhoenix> Black**
<CrystalPhoenix> cause that's the rarest I believe
<PaperSpade[R]> Its like 20-21 i believe

*AdamTheDuck sees hammer and sickle and swastika
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut Saturn.
<PaperSpade[R]> God I am getting such a fucking nostalgia rush from this game
<Stormy> Oh here we go
*Stormy grabs popcorn
<Kjakings> 7meh not really cbf for this
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Did you know, if you took all the bronies in the USA and put them in canada, 1 in 3 people would be bronies.
<Kjakings> 7tired
<BladedWings> Same here PaperSpade[R]
<Kjakings> 7This guy in my history basically came out as brony to me today. that was weird.
<PaperSpade[R]> I kind got weirded out by FLurry first time I saw her
<Kjakings> 7hasn't seen any of season 2 yet
<Stormy> lol...
<Spyrorocks[Air]> OH I have a story for you guys
<PaperSpade[R]> The fact she has very obvious breasts in what I assume a kids game is odd
<CrystalPhoenix> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7a89f9b0112c3f16dacec86041871f0d.png
<Spyrorocks[Air]> sunday night I went down to the usa to pick some stuff up at harbour freight
<Stormy> I hate when people refer to it as "coming out"
<Stormy> so melodramatic
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I was comingback, and was all like, I hope I wont have to pay taxes
<PaperSpade[R]> CrystalPhoenix: Erm
<Spyrorocks[Air]> becasue I had like $300 worth of chinese goods
<CrystalPhoenix> My main character in Street Fighter mixed with best pony
<Spyrorocks[Air]> and they charge you to bring it back but its still cheaper than buying in canada
<CrystalPhoenix> perfect
<Spyrorocks[Air]> so I had my rainbow dash hat on
<PaperSpade[R]> How the fuck do you instal a electronic door in a TREE
<Spyrorocks[Air]> coming through the border
<PaperSpade[R]> WHERE ARE THE WIRES
<Spyrorocks[Air]> the dude stops me
<Spyrorocks[Air]> "whats the value of goods coming back?"
<Spyrorocks[Air]> me "about $300"
<PaperSpade[R]> Where the hell is the power coming from!
<pony_3045> wireless door
<Spyrorocks[Air]> him: "have a good night, rainbow dash."
<Spyrorocks[Air]> woot no tax :P
<pony_3045> power coming from nature
<PaperSpade[R]> We must go inside Fluttertree
<PaperSpade[R]> Fluttertree! HUZZAH!
<Ryunosuke> PaperSpade[R]: probably the same way Twi has a library in a tree with a wood burning stove in the kitchen and a fire breathing dragon living there :)
<Stormy> Rainbow Dash: Too awesome for taxes
<pony_3045> not sure if don't want be inside flutter...tree
<PaperSpade[R]> Ots the Deku Tree!
<PaperSpade[R]> Lets go kill Gohma
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Its like a secret society.

<Spyrorocks[Air]> sometimes its better to just let him have his fun :P
<CrystalPhoenix> COUNTER
<Stormy> I suppose so
<PaperSpade[R]> What partner did you guys use all the time in this game?
<CrystalPhoenix> LEVEL UP
<CrystalPhoenix> I can't remember
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I also got a brohoof from a home depot employee. dont know if I said that here before :P
<PaperSpade[R]> I ususally used Vivian because of her fire nuke
<CrystalPhoenix> KOOPS
<CrystalPhoenix> Aw shit
<Stormy> Kinda disappointed Kjakings didn't actually start a stupid nationalism argument though :P
<Stormy> Haha, nice

<xles> SuperBrony64: Should've seen that one comin'. =P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Seriously, Derpy is best poneh :3
<AdamTheDuck> Objection, Crackles is best poneh :3
<pony_3045> all ponies are best ponies
<thelonepony> But SuperBrony64 is best sillieh poneh :3
<Spyrorocks[Air]> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/5989537_460s.jpg

<CrystalPhoenix> #2: http://fav.me/d5n05vp
<xles> SuperBrony64: Righto. Just curious, trying to figure out who to draw for tomorrow. ^^
<thelonepony> Ponies47: all i see is " SuperBrony64 is best poneh"
<CrystalPhoenix> and #1: http://fav.me/d5mzn80
<thelonepony> :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02xles: Derpeh :D
<BladedWings> nice CrystalPhoenix
<CrystalPhoenix> oh here's a better version for number 1 http://sta.sh/0257kxxbxcfm
<SuperBrony64> 11,02xles: Or you could draw meh :3c
<xles> SuperBrony64: Hehe, we'll see! The decision is usually 0.2 seconds before I set my pencil on the paper. =)
<Bronysith> CrystalPhoenix: dat plot
<Ponies47> Nah silly ponies. Navy Numbers is best pony http://i.imgur.com/X7UvE.png :3
<CrystalPhoenix> Ponies47, that's not a wallpaper
<AdamTheDuck> DoshWithRonbows :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02xles: For me, it usually changes depending on how I draw at the moment :P
<xles> SuperBrony64: I only draw one way - badly. ;)
<thelonepony> Ponies47: i wish i had awesome drawing skill as youh ;3;
<Ponies47> CrystalPhoenix, :p
<pony_3045> Maplehoof is a best pony
<CrystalPhoenix> xles, you don't draw badly
<CrystalPhoenix> you draw your way
<thelonepony> i think he was implying something
<Stormy> I do not remember gameboys being that big
<thelonepony> with the whole " ;)"
<xles> CrystalPhoenix: Exactly!
<Spyrorocks[Air]> probably not old enough.
<Stormy> is there some kind of thing attached to it or something?
<CrystalPhoenix> positive thinking
<Stormy> I actually did have an original gameboy
<pony_3045> positive force
<Stormy> My uncle found it in his photography studio and just gave it to us
<Spyrorocks[Air]> its like some kind of light
<xles> Oh poppycock. I know where my skill lies. And I try to improve on them so that I wont suck as much tomorrow as I do today. Best mindset, for me. Constant search for improvement. *nod*
<Spyrorocks[Air]> or maybe a battery pack
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Are we doing the "X is best pony" thing with OCs again?
<Stormy> and then my dad smashed it with a hammer
<BladedWings> AssaultWithEmbraces: i think so?
<thelonepony> Not sure
<pony_3045> /)*(\ - my OC from back
<Kimori> I think I use to have that
<thelonepony> I dont have an OC, but i dont feel like making one
<SuperBrony64> 11,02brb
<thelonepony> atm
<Stormy> I have a Mario game from 1989 that came with it
<Stormy> Lost all the other games though
<Kimori> You know what, I have that game boy light boxed :P
<Kimori> I'm sure of it, ill have to find it
<pony_3045> hiv
<AdamTheDuck> thelonepony, same, but too lazy :$
<xles> SuperBrony64: I can poke you in my daily sketch tweet if I end up drawing miss derp if you'd like.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> lol
<thelonepony> AdamTheDuck: wait, i thought that pic was yo... nevermind :$
<Spyrorocks[Air]> your dad smashed it...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02xles: That would be awesome~
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But Tweet me anyway no matter what you draw :)
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I have been threatened so many times to have my computers smashed with hammers.
<AdamTheDuck> thelonepony, nah it's Gold_Demona's :P
<Kimori> why?
<Stormy> haha...I'm sure I have too
<Spyrorocks[Air]> But now the joke's on him, I claim computers as a company expense and pay with the company card.
<thelonepony> AdamTheDuck: really? it was cute :3
<xles> SuperBrony64: Hehe, drew rainbow dash as a sled dog...pony, today. =P
<Kimori> was it disipline back then?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02xles: Cool :3
<xles> Well, sketched, rather.
<Stormy> My dad always just took away my stuff though
<Spyrorocks[Air]> my dad never smashed any of my stuff.
<Stormy> He claims he smashed the gameboy because it was broken
<Spyrorocks[Air]> he just threatened to do it.
<DarkRainbow> sh
<Kimori> ah
<AdamTheDuck> thelonepony, ikr, that's why I think socks are adorable :$
<Stormy> but really there were just a couple lines through the screen
<Spyrorocks[Air]> we have a pretty good relationship now though, so its all good.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02xles: Nice :D
<POOTISPONY> :3
<DarkRainbow> TRIXIE:|
<Stormy> So my brother and I make fun of him and say he smashed it because he was getting too addicted to Tetris
<Kimori> thats good
<xles> She's NOT pleased with the situation. ;)
<pony_3045> wow 3:15 am really time to go to bed
<BladedWings> hi DarkRainbow
<Kimori> Remember the Tetris commercial?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> also lol.. we are doing a gift exchange with our family
<Spyrorocks[Air]> and I have an uncle Brad
<pony_3045> for mah
<Spyrorocks[Air]> on the list of who buys for who
<DarkRainbow> Hello
<Spyrorocks[Air]> There are two brads and no one knows which one is which
<Spyrorocks[Air]> so we dont know who we are buying for.
<Stormy> There was a Tetris commercial?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I dont think they thought that through before they sent the email out with the list of names....
<Stormy> I'm probably too young for that one
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi DarkRainbow
<alexxm|foal> how've you been DarkRainbow
<Kimori> How old are you Stormy? I keep forgetting
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DarkRainbow
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I dislike video game commercials.
<Stormy> We have a few people in my family with the same names like that
<Stormy> Big Michael and little Michael
<thelonepony> HI DarkRainbow
<Kimori> lol
<DarkRainbow> ......
<Stormy> I'm 21
<Rose`Brokenstem> is this the first paper mario?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> My Brothers name is Michael and my other uncle's name is Michael.
<DarkRainbow> Hi
<Rose`Brokenstem> hi
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Second one Rose`Brokenstem
<Rose`Brokenstem> ;o
<DarkRainbow> O
<Rose`Brokenstem> SuperBrony64, halp! i got broked at Combatives today
<PaperSpade[R]> Oh here we go!
<DarkRainbow> :[
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZV9IlTJcIg Now before you laugh, remember its 1985
<DarkRainbow> Meh
<Stormy> haha, yeah that was way before my time
<BladedWings> hi Rose`Brokenstem ...why Broken?
<PaperSpade[R]> Shouldent SB be at higher health at this point?
<Rose`Brokenstem> wankers knocked me out 7 times, and dislocated 3 joints
<PaperSpade[R]> I ususally have more than 10 by now
<Rose`Brokenstem> but i gave more than i got
<alexxm|foal> SuperBrony64 the one with the nerd who wnats to marry peach
<AdamTheDuck> Rose`Brokenstem, :/
<Rose`Brokenstem> broke a guys nose today because people kept underestimating the small white girl
<Stormy> I didn't even start watching TV with commercials until probably like 1999
<Rose`Brokenstem> also, dislocated 5 sholders
<Kimori> oh
<Rose`Brokenstem> and knocked out 10 people
<AdamTheDuck> Rose`Brokenstem, hope they got what they deserve :P
<Rose`Brokenstem> but im hurting
<Spyrorocks[Air]> The commercials from when I was like 10 years old on the cartoon channels are the same commercials they play today.
<Stormy> haha that's awesome
<Kimori> Some video game commercials were real awesome
<Derpy_Hooves> :3
<Spyrorocks[Air]> For example, the Yop commercials
<CriticKitten> Dis slideshow.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> do you guys get the Yop commercials?
<PaperSpade[R]> Is SuperBrony64 doing a low hp run or something?
<Kimori> uhhhh
<Stormy> Yop as in that penguin PC game?
<Stormy> :O
<Stormy> I played that
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Yop as in the yougurt drinkl
<Kimori> I'm not familar with it
<Spyrorocks[Air]> yogurt
<PaperSpade[R]> Because no offense but I usualy have at least 15/20 at this point
<Stormy> Oh lol
<Spyrorocks[Air]> maybe its just a canadian product.
<Rose`Brokenstem> offense taken!
<Rose`Brokenstem> ow
<spitfirecolt> hay everypony why is episode 8 and 9 on the same day
<Rose`Brokenstem> im too hurt to be falsly indignant
<Spyrorocks[Air]> They have been using the same commercial for as long as I can remember.
<CriticKitten> What does a fence have to do with this game?
<DarkRainbow> ONO
<Stormy> I remember having this computer game YOP for "Your Own Penguin"
<Stormy> I have no idea where it even came from or anything
<Spyrorocks[Air]> In school, did you ever have Dino Park Tycoon game
<Stormy> No
<Stormy> I had Roller Coaster Tycoon at home though
<Kimori> I remember that game
<Stormy> And Zoo Tycoon had a dinosaur expansion
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Roller coaster tycoon 1 was the best.,
<Spyrorocks[Air]> it still is the best.
<alexxm|foal> wow is that book a pokedex
<thelonepony> somewhat close to one
<DocSane> Hey, all.
<thelonepony> Hi DocSane
<DocSane> Problem with the stream?
<PaperSpade[R]> One thing I like about Door over the first is the partners no longer get fucking stunned
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DocSane
<AdamTheDuck> Nope just go ot the link in the embeded
<PaperSpade[R]> I hated that in the first Paper mario
<Bronysith> are you guys still talking about paper mario?
<Kimori> The games I played in school were all educational
<Stormy> I tried installing it again recently and for some reason it couldn't remember the stuff I'd unlocked =/
<Kimori> But they were actually fun
<DocSane> Ah...
<spitfirecolt> whats up with twitch not working here
<PaperSpade[R]> Bronysith: Well Super is freaking streaming it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bronysith: Probably cause I'm playing it :P
<DocSane> Is there much point to a stream that can only run in a separate tab?
<Stormy> every time I quit the game it lost all memory of unlocked parks
<Spyrorocks[Air]> someone needs to adapt roller coaster tycoon 1 into a browser based game'
<Stormy> So even if I had a save with one of them it wouldn't let me play on it
<DocSane> I mean, I just tossed it to a second monitor, but what about everyone else?
<Stormy> that would be awesome
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You can view it in the embed if you're not using Chrome.
<CrystalPhoenix> DocSane, I use an IRC client
<PaperSpade[R]> Wait... how is twitch working on out site?
<DocSane> Oh... And I'm using Chrome.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> port it to html5 and javascriuopt.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> well you cant really port it
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but you can recreate it.
<PaperSpade[R]> I thought Twitch never worked on this
<Spyrorocks[Air]> wouldnt be easy though
<Stormy> I read that the guy made the game mostly in assembly
<Stormy> I would die
<DocSane> Wonder why Chrome isn't working for this.
<AJIsHaunter> Style~
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Twitch is weird like that
<Spyrorocks[Air]> yeah
<thelonepony> wb AJIsHaunter :)
<Stormy> and by himself
<Spyrorocks[Air]> mostly assembly, I think the sound drivers and stuff like that was C
<Spyrorocks[Air]> yeah
<Spyrorocks[Air]> chris cawyer
<Spyrorocks[Air]> sawyer
<AJIsHaunter> I remember just putting down the controller and just listening to the music as you traverse this area. :)
<Spyrorocks[Air]> very talented programmer.
<AJIsHaunter> Also, thanks, thelonepony. :)
<Spyrorocks[Air]> asm looks daunting, but its actually quite logical.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back AJIsHaunter :)
<AJIsHaunter> Thanks, MLP_Brovakiin. :)
<Spyrorocks[Air]> if you want to half ass it, just use a lot of winapi calls :P
<Stormy> I've done some MIPS for one of my classes
<Stormy> Never again
<PaperSpade[R]> SuperBrony64: Have you been leveling up at all? You seem kinda low on health for this point..may just be me
<BladedWings> wb AJIsHaunter :)
<CriticKitten> ....is SB being stalked by a Pikmin?
<AJIsHaunter> Thank you, BladedWings. :)
<Spyrorocks[Air]> you can pretty much make apps in asm using api calls commonly used in visual basic
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CriticKitten: Lol, that's a Puni :P
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but its kind of cheating.
<CriticKitten> So a Pikmin?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> what did you make?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02PaperSpade[R]: I'm going for mainly BP in my Level Ups
<Spyrorocks[Air]> MIPS is embedded programming isnt it
<PaperSpade[R]> That seems a bti risky
<Stormy> Really really simple stuff
*thelonepony wants to nom on BladedWings wings right now, but is afraid to get cut
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], you should ONLY level BP
*thelonepony does it anyway :3c
<AJIsHaunter> thelonepony: Then don't do it? :D
<Stormy> Just basic array manipulation and stuff
<PaperSpade[R]> I always go health, fp bp
<CrystalPhoenix> PaperSpade[R], BP run, have you heard of it?
<PaperSpade[R]> In that order
*BladedWings gives thelonepony a muffin to nom on
<AJIsHaunter> I love up all the stats in order until they reach a certain amount.
<Stormy> I think it was
<PaperSpade[R]> Cant some bosses hit for more than 10 in a single attack?
<AJIsHaunter> After 50 in both HP and FP, I switch to BP and just focus on that.
*thelonepony noms on BladedWings instead :3c

<PaperSpade[R]> Bronysith: The hell is that unholy abomination supposed to be?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi dabi
<AssaultWithEmbraces> PaperSpade[R], better question: WHY on earth would someone make something like that?
<Bronysith> http://mokrosuhibrijac.deviantart.com/art/OC-Dante-in-his-Tartarus-armor-336892542
<coinflip2> Bronysith: KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!!!
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, had a jolly good time playing yet another instalment of the famous nintendo mascot.
<Bronysith> http://badponyocs.tumblr.com/image/36299108795
<RainbowDerpy> ded
<PaperSpade[R]> Just curious am I the only one here who kind of finds the whole coin gimmick of NSMB 2 stupid?
<CrystalPhoenix> He's focusing quite intesnely while playing it until
<RainbowDerpy> i agree
<Bronysith> so many bad pony OCs
<AJIsHaunter> PaperSpade[R]: It's only really good for things such as coin rush, IMO.
<CrystalPhoenix> out of the blue while he was about to do his last hit on the koopaling
<Bronysith> god
<coinflip2> Bronysith: that OC Dante is SICK!
<Bronysith> if you make a pony OC, DONT GIVE IT A BACKGROUND
<Bronysith> EVER
<PaperSpade[R]> The fact they use the coin thing as a selling point seems lazy
<Bronysith> no story, it only makes it worse, no matter what
<PaperSpade[R]> Coins are in every mario game, LETS MAKE A GIMMICK OUT OF IT
<CrystalPhoenix> a racecar came out from the side with an odd looking man yelling out
*AssaultWithEmbraces slaps Bronysith for the last link
<CrystalPhoenix> TURBOTASTIC
*Bronysith takes AssaultWithEmbraces to bed
<twixie_sprinkle> im prett sure those are troll OC's
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Can I get warm chocolate milk and a bedtime story? :3
<twixie_sprinkle> that last one's cutie mark is a standard windows wallpaper i think
<AJIsHaunter> twixie_sprinkle: That's also somehting to consider.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> twixie_sprinkle, yes it is
<PaperSpade[R]> So is the new power called Squirrel mario?
<coinflip2> twixie_sprinkle: ya it is lawl
<Bronysith> i dont know, there are some idiots out there who spend lots of money on shit pony art
<twixie_sprinkle> so i would think its just troll OC's
<AJIsHaunter> PaperSpade[R]: Squirrel suit, I think.
<Irish_Pony> CrystalPhoenix love that movie
<CrystalPhoenix> Irish_Pony, of course
<AdamTheDuck> twixie_sprinkle, ^
<twixie_sprinkle> i was actually going to make a troll OC myself, but never got around to it
<PaperSpade[R]> Also I love how bowser does the reverse of what he usualy does in this game
<Bronysith> the only troll on bronystate is prince-dari
<PaperSpade[R]> Instead of kidnapping the princess he throws mario and co out
<AssaultWithEmbraces> If I everr make a troll OC, I will make sure your eye will BURN frrom the color alone
<twixie_sprinkle> well, i already have my uber awesome OC already though
<Firelight> hello.
<PaperSpade[R]> Genius
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: You weren't here a couple days ago, weren't you?
<BladedWings> hi Firelight
<twixie_sprinkle> hoi Firelight
<CrystalPhoenix> if I ever make myself a legit OC
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, Firelight. :)
<CrystalPhoenix> it'll be a phoenix
<coinflip2> ohai Firelight
<SpadeKyurem[R]> CrystalPhoenix: ya dont say
<CrystalPhoenix> cause I'm hipster like that
<SpadeKyurem[R]> OH HAI BOOM BOOM
<Firelight> ugh.. I know I got on but i will be right back.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> You useless sack of crap
<Bronysith> dat realization that fluttershy is a selfish bitch
<RainbowDerpy> FAIL
<AssaultWithEmbraces> He's like the Leomon of the koopas
<BladedWings> Well hell that was easy ^_^
<CrystalPhoenix> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mej12tikPP1qdlamz.gif
<SpadeKyurem[R]> God boom boom you are pathetic
<twixie_sprinkle> Bronysith: i stop liking her 1.5 seasons ago
<cratorkid> that guy had raditz's power level
<SpadeKyurem[R]> SO what world is this? 4?
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: Also, on the story bit you were going on about, I don't mind a story behind one as long as it doesn't make them a terrible OC or a Mary Sue.
<twixie_sprinkle> *stopped
<AJIsHaunter> CrystalPhoenix: May I ask where the "Turbo-Tastic" bit ame from?
<AJIsHaunter> *came
<Bronysith> AJIsHaunter: doesnt matter, make a background or a story for an OC and it will be mary sue
<cratorkid> AJIsHaunter: or a gary stue
<SpadeKyurem[R]> SuperBrony64: What world is this? 4?
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: And now you're just making assumptions.
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: Two, I think.
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsHaunter: Wreck It Ralph
<AJIsHaunter> J_E_Smith71: ?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SpadeKyurem[R]: Yeah
<AJIsHaunter> Ah, nvm then SpadeKyurem[R] .
<[1]CrystalPhoenix> AJIsHaunter, Wrek it ralph of course
<[1]CrystalPhoenix> anyway gotta go
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The fact World one has a shortcut to world 4 i think is silly
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsHaunter: You asked Phoenix where the "TurboTastic" bit came from, which was Wreck It Ralph
<twixie_sprinkle> its funny how many gifs there are of soccer players faking it, the sport's become somewhat of a laughing stock
<AJIsHaunter> J_E_Smith71: Oh........
<CrystalPhoenix[ACT]> TO ART I GO
<coinflip2> bai [1]CrystalPheonix
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye CrystalPhoenix
<twixie_sprinkle> bye CrystalPhoenix
<coinflip2> crap i spelled the username wrong...

<SpadeKyurem[R]> The hell was the applause for?
<AJIsHaunter> *applause

<SpadeKyurem[R]> I dont get what their applauding him fore
<SpadeKyurem[R]> *for
<AJIsHaunter> I'm guessing it's supposed to congratulate you on doing certain things?
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeKyurem[R]: It does that in the NSMB games sometimes, such as getting all Star Coins and stuff
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So...not achivements
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Well I didnt mind it for star coins but he just gets coins and they applaud
<SpadeKyurem[R]> its odd
<Kandarihu> I take back what I said about this game being all the same as the the classics. It HAS been improved.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> YOU CLEVER BITCH LEVEL
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I hate it when ghost houses/ships pull that shit
<coinflip2> bye guys! :)
<BladedWings> bye coinflip2
<AssaultWithEmbraces> My favorite world in NSMB Wii is 8. The levels had some awesome music
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye coinflip2
<cratorkid> bye coinflip2
<AJIsHaunter> I think the game looks very interesting, but one of the gripes I have with it is that it recycled music from NSMB Wii instead of making different music. Then again, that's just m.
<AJIsHaunter> *me
<AJIsHaunter> Bye, coinflip2. :)
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Does this game have that over world encounter like NSMB wii had?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Yep
<SpadeKyurem[R]> YOU ATE YOSHI
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Yoshiception!
<AJIsHaunter> YOSHI! NO!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> You tratious swine
<RainbowDerpy> Nope
<Kandarihu> Yoshi holding a baby of his own kind in his mouth.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> *traitorous
<NullRadix> yoshi's mouth is like a kangaroo's pouch
<NullRadix> ... except sometimes things don't come out
<Bronysith> yoshi and kirby are the two most incredibly evil things ever
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Anyone remember omnishells?
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: ?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The rainbow shells from world
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: It's mainly because they're mainly simplistic creatures.
<AJIsHaunter> Gah, why do I use words twice sometimes? :S
<Bronysith> AJIsHaunter: or the fact that yoshi throws his/her unborn children as weapons
<onix> sup
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I find that betrayle pic hilarious
<thelonepony> AJIsHaunter: i know tjat feel
<thelonepony> that*
<Bronysith> or that kirby eats entire buildings, swallowing their souls and taking their powers
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: What if there's a process in which one egg is a child and the other is an object used for throwing?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Bronysith: Dont forget he went on a mass slaughter over fucking cake
<Afflict> Remember to always be yourself, unless you can be Batman. Always be Batman.
<Afflict> amen
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[R]: this is why they are evil
<NullRadix> Bronysith: not every chicken egg will become a chicken if left alone
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Someone stole my cake? Time to kill everything
<AJIsHaunter> Like I said, Kirby's a mainly simplistic creature. He's not exactly the most sentient being on the planet.
<RainbowDerpy> fail
<Bronysith> kirby is evil
<AJIsHaunter> But I see what you're getting at.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> AJIsHaunter: He's pretty much a kid
<cratorkid> how unfortunate
<J_E_Smith71> That fail
<J_E_Smith71> That didn't work
<Bronysith> kirby and yoshi are evil
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: Pretty much. A kid who doesn't really have a complex establishment of morals.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I assume Meta Knight is kirby except with morals and compex thought
<NullRadix> I'm pretty sure how yoshi interacts with the donut platforms on this is significantly evil
<AJIsHaunter> Plus, Kirby was woken up prematurely. He's not supposed to be that way.
<RainbowDerpy> NOPE
<SpadeKyurem[R]> YOSHI NOO
<otakon> dun dun dun dun dun dun DUUUN
<SpadeKyurem[R]> At least Chargin Chuck isnt in this game
<RainbowDerpy> NOPE
<cratorkid> nuuuuu
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Denied
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat jaymoo
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ded
<J_E_Smith71> Still didn't work
<aniderp|bestcakeever> awake? xD
<SpadeKyurem[R]> SQUIRLE POWER
<Saturn> 08,01# 'cause the bride, she was a changeling #
<Saturn> 08,01(to the tune of The Times They Are A-Changing
<AJIsHaunter> In one way, Yoshi acts somewhat similar to animals. He protects the group he supports, and does what he can to survive.
<Saturn> 08,01)
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsHaunter invaded my parenthesis!
<AJIsHaunter> ?
<RainbowDerpy> lol
<AJIsHaunter> Oh. My apologies, Saturn.
<cratorkid> lawl
<SpadeKyurem[R]> THE EVIL FISH
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Really? Super guide?
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/fMFCH.jpg
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Doesnt thatr ruin your ranking forever if that ever shows up in Wii?
<Bronysith> HA
<Bronysith> Shizuka: HA
<RainbowDerpy> denied
<AJIsHaunter> Would I consider Yoshi and Kirby to be evil? No. Incredibly simplistic, Maybe.
<Buytoast> Kirby is demonic
<NullRadix> SpadeKyurem[R]: yeah I believe if you EVER even SEE it you lose something in the Wii version
<Buytoast> he will swallow your soul
<NullRadix> also, Miiverse prompts: wut?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02lol Shizuka
<Buytoast> you saw what he did to marx
<AssaultWithEmbraces> lol Shizuka
<Kandarihu> NullRadix, I agree.
<Buytoast> that poor bastard never stood a chacne
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I still find it weird Kirby goes on a fucking rampage over CAKE
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: No, if you let the Super Guide take over a level, it would ruin your ranking.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> AJIsHaunter: Actually i think if it even shows up your ranking is ruined
<Buytoast> some freedoms even Uncle sam cannot appropriate
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Buytoast: MURICA
<AJIsHaunter> It would only allow you to have three stars instead of three glistening stars.
<Kandarihu> So what's that green '!' box for?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> These damn fish are from hell
<SpadeKyurem[R]> AJIsHaunter: That still kind of ruins your rank
<NullRadix> Kandarihu: super guide. The game plays itself so you can continue the game isntead of stuck forever
<AJIsHaunter> Kandarihu: It's an option that allows the Super Guide to take over for the rest f the level.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Kandarihu: If you fail hard enough on a stage it takes over
<Buytoast> goddamn this background music has more BAAs than a sheep farm
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So its a You suck let a pro handle it button
<RainbowDerpy> NOPE
<cratorkid> oh god
<RainbowDerpy> FAIL
<cratorkid> id be PISSED
<SpadeKyurem[R]> YOU TRATOROUS SWINE
<Kandarihu> Oh, like in Donkey Kong Country Returns?
<AJIsHaunter> Kandarihu: Yep.
<NullRadix> although *sometimes* the game is actually JUST hard enough or hiding things well enough
<Buytoast> now tell me
<Buytoast> donkety kong coutnry returns
<NullRadix> darned... ghost houses...
<Buytoast> are the kremlings in it
<Buytoast> please say yes
<AJIsHaunter> Buytoast: Nope.
<Buytoast> WHAT
<Buytoast> HORSESHIT
<Buytoast> what does he fight then?
<AJIsHaunter> Regardless if they were, I had PLENTY of fun with the game.
<RainbowDerpy> fail
<AJIsHaunter> Buytoast: Demonic Tiki creatures, if I recall.
<Buytoast> giant mutant bananas or soemthing?
<Buytoast> tiki creatures?
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: He fights evil Tiki
<Buytoast> he aint crash bandicoot
<Kandarihu> I swear. I wish there were demand for parental controls to disable Super Guide modes.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> SuperBrony64: http://turboultra.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/betrayal1.jpg
<Buytoast> some backwards shit right there
<AJIsHaunter> Buytoast: You'd have to look it up. It's hard to describe.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Kandarihu, why?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> You traitorous swine
<AJIsHaunter> They possessed the animals and make them do their bidding.
<Buytoast> bah, i'd rather go and play donkey kong country 2 on me grandma's SNES
<Buytoast> at least it has kremlings
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Can't be swine if they're fish, SpadeKyurem[R]
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: You fight these guys: http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110310143147/mario/de/images/e/ed/DKCR_Artwork_Tiki_Tak_Stamm.png
<AJIsHaunter> I enjoyed the game, regardless of the enemy change.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So why was K Rool missing in Returns?
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: I'm guessing he got tired of losing?
<Buytoast> hell, i'd pay money out the ass if k rool was in the next smash bros
<AJIsHaunter> That and people were tired of seeing the Kremlings in the previous DK installments?
<Buytoast> now there's a bad ass that'll whoop you to next week
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Maybe K rool finally croaked
<SpadeKyurem[R]> FAILURE
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NOOOO
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I PUT MAH PANTS ON BY MAHSELF THIS MORNING
<Kandarihu> I'm seeing an increased backlash against a percieved culture of "participation trophies" in which children are no longer challenged to play to be #1.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Read the FAILURE in the SmashBros Announcer voice
<NullRadix> DING DING
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Kandarihu: I hate the everyone is a winner shit
<SpadeKyurem[R]> There's winners and losers deal with it
<AJIsHaunter> Seeing how he's failed time and time again against the DK crew.
<Buytoast> b-b-but it's mean to call our wittle babies losers!
<AJIsHaunter> I doubt he'd want to fight them again.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Everyone is a winner, except those who suck
<NullRadix> TRAITOR!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> http://turboultra.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/betrayal1.jpg
<NullRadix> YOU DROPPED YOSHI FOR AN EXTRA JUMP

<Buytoast> goddamn cheep cheeps are cumbersome

*AssaultWithEmbraces noms SuperBrony64
<Buytoast> that's Uncle Sam's war cry
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Rage quit?
<Buytoast> it is reserved for him and him alone
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: I'm guessing it's loading.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Loading...why are we still loading
<AJIsHaunter> Either that or something went wrong on SB's side.
<Kandarihu> AJIsHaunter, it's too long for mere loading.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> This isnt Sonic 06 game
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: You alright?
<cratorkid> o6 was the worst
<Kandarihu> Loading screens are only black when there's no expectation of long loading times.
<jcelios> Game Design 101!
<Kandarihu> Loading screens are only black when there's no expectation of long loading times.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> This is like Sonic 06

<cratorkid> AssaultWithEmbraces: yeah, like 30 min from charlotte
<AssaultWithEmbraces> cratorkid, BladedWings: We need to get Nittany_Discord (since he lives in Rock Hill too) and the 4 of us should have like, a BState meetup someplace
<BladedWings> AssaultWithEmbraces: yeeeees ^_^ and i didnt know Nittany_Discord lived in SC as well :O

<AJIsHaunter> D:
<Shizuka> 13why would you want to meet people?
<BladedWings> cratorkid: awesoooooome ^_^
<BladedWings> Shizuka: why not? ^_^
<AJIsHaunter> Shizuka: ?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> cratorkid, we have a lot down here. Thing is this is part of the almight Bible Belt and the southerners don't really "approve" of grown men watching a show about pastel ponies
<BladedWings> they'd be ok with you though AssaultWithEmbraces ^_^
<jcelios> Princecess Celestia is a pagan god!
<AJIsHaunter> ?
<jcelios> EVIL
<AssaultWithEmbraces> BladedWings: But then I'd get the "Aren't you too old to be watching My Little Pony?" question.
<BladedWings> Better than "You are a guy watching MLP so you must be gay" shtick
<DashWithRainbows> Aren't you too old to watch My little pony, AssaultWithEmbraces?
<cratorkid> AssaultWithEmbraces: nods* in the north even alot of my friends where intolerable about it, but its k so long as i dont shove it down their throats, which some do
<AssaultWithEmbraces> DashWithRainbows: Nope
<BladedWings> cratorkid: same
<DashWithRainbows> Then you must be a young girl
<DashWithRainbows> Ha
<BladedWings> the shove down throats part i mean cratorkid :$
<AssaultWithEmbraces> DashWithRainbows: Will be 21 in January, dea
<AssaultWithEmbraces> dear*
<J_E_Smith71> Oh damn it. My class was cancelled tomorrow, so I cancelled my ride to school. Then I find out I still have to go up there anyway just to fill out a course evaluation form-_-

*AdamTheDuck licks Klumz - aww gone ;~;
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I wanna know who the Koopaling's mother is
<AJIsHaunter> Oh, nvm.
<cratorkid> the only prob with a meet up would be that im 16, so a brand new license, and no car, and ther is no way in h ell my mum would let me use hers
<SpadeKyurem[R]> DIdnt Miamoto confirm they are not Bowser's kids?
*AdamTheDuck licks Klumzeedragon :3
<AJIsHaunter> I do know that Iggy's the first, though.

<RobotdragonX> cant wait to look back on Dec. 21
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: Take Nabbit, for example. I was thinking of "Dang it, it's Nabbit again" when I saw him. Then I thought of another approach. Dang. Nabbit. Combined the two into a pun. :D
<AssaultWithEmbraces> IT WAS RIGHT THERE
<BladedWings> RoboGerbil: why?
<BladedWings> AJIsHaunter: wouldnt it be dag nabbit?
<RobotdragonX> BladedWings we can have a good lol at those who thought i was going to happen.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, I saw what you did there. My timing and originality forr puns are horrible
<AssaultWithEmbraces> :D
<AJIsHaunter> BladedWings: That too, but I wanted to suit the mood since the name is Nabbit. :D
<BladedWings> AssaultWithEmbraces: Like when he kept getting crushed by the blocks is how i thought the level was "crushing" him ^_^
<AJIsHaunter> Plus, I always saw it as "Dang Nabbit" instead of "Dag nabbit" as a kid. :P
<thelonepony> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6re0nYi6R1rzn06do2_500.jpg toast :3
<SpadeKyurem[R]> This is verry punny
<BladedWings> AJIsHaunter: i always heard it as dag nabbit but to each his own ^_^
<AJIsHaunter> BladedWings: I guess this level's got a bit of a CRUSH on SB, don't you think? :3
<RobotdragonX> it wants him
<BladedWings> AJIsHaunter: Its almost, dare i say, smashing?

<thelonepony> twixie_sprinkle: wait, really?

<jcelios> these days there is almost zero hardware difference between the two so yeah...
<thelonepony> ...
<jcelios> basically the case and the keyboard
<twixie_sprinkle> thelonepony: well i mean mac doesnt run many programs that people might need
<twixie_sprinkle> because most programs are .exe
<thelonepony> ah
<twixie_sprinkle> macs dont run .exe, so people have install windows on it, which costs more money
<twixie_sprinkle> so often you have to buy the mac+windows
<twixie_sprinkle> and macs are already overpriced
<thelonepony> ah i see
<jcelios> Toad
<jcelios> 's scamming
<SuperBrony64> 11,02lol
<AJIsHaunter> I have NO idea why, but I love this world's music especially. I'm guessing because it's peaceful. :D

<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter: Really?
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: Yep. Think so.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, I meant the one in the level. I thought it leads you to some secret exit that will take you to the next level

<AJIsHaunter> RDash5000: FOr the Pokemon pun. :D
<RDash5000> AJIsHaunter: i see. carry on

<AJIsHaunter> D:

<RDash5000> is it weird that i hate kids?
*thelonecubone attacks are useless :<
<AJIsHaunter> RDash5000: No. I know people who hate kids.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So was Peach's castle built over a fucking volcano?
<RDash5000> my friend has a level 100 magickarp. i shit you not
<PrincessCholestrolia> peach has Stockholm syndrome.
<StuffCrusader> i love magikarp

<SuperBrony64> 11,02lol not going back
<AJIsHaunter> :D
<thelonecubone> heres one person http://derpibooru.org/163154 AJIsHaunter
<BladedWings> i dont blame ya SB
<thelonecubone> :>
<Tovler> >mfw NSMBU is almost kicking my ass.
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> oh hey Wii
<AssaultWithEmbraces> SpadeKyurem[R]: Nope. Prime real esate. Plus "Me big, Mario puny. He can't beat my lava!"
<AJIsHaunter> thelonecubone: I see what you did there. :D
<RDash5000> thelonecubone: thank you. i feel better about myself now
<thelonecubone> you did <_<
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> lol so legendary :3
<BladedWings> AssaultWithEmbraces: eeyup
<SpadeKyurem[R]> You would think Bowser would be adversive to lava given how many times he burned to death in it
<StuffCrusader> damn that thing is really crying now
<thelonecubone> Suicune_Toku_Brony: whu not toarkol D:
<thelonecubone> why*
<Tovler> So Bowser's like the Heat Meiser. Wherever he lives turns to a volcanic wasteland.
<thelonecubone> http://derpibooru.org/172884
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I believe this is the part where Mario goes "Shit shit shit!" at the lava
<BladedWings> AssaultWithEmbraces: sounds about right XD
<RDash5000> thelonecubone: :D
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> thelonecubone: i remembered Suicune >~< and it was one of the pokemon in Gold/Silver i liked :D wish i played Daimond/Pearl 6_9

<StuffCrusader> yes,yes i like it
<LadyCanary> jcelios has the right idea.

<Canadian_Brony> That's better. Hello everypony!
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, Canadian_Brony. :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Let's do this!
<CrazyHippie> Ello Canadian_Brony
<StuffCrusader> oooooh,the final battle :o
<SpadeKyurem[R]> LEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ESSSBEEEESIXFOOOOUR

<thelonecubone> through*
<CrazyHippie> ow
<thelonecubone> Hi Canadian_Brony :)
<J_E_Smith71> Is really the final battle? There's not another last minute castle?
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64: Could you maybe the try the P-Mushrooms? Do those give unlimited flight like the P-Wings? Maybe you could just fly over him
<AssaultWithEmbraces> J_E_Smith71: This is Bowser, so there might and there might not be
<SuperBrony64> 11,02J_E_Smith71: They give you unlimited float-ups
<CriticKitten> That's not ominous
<BladedWings> dat door
<AJIsHaunter> .....
<CrazyHippie> dun dun dun
<AJIsHaunter> That door.
<Saturn> 08,01oh god, bronystate
<Saturn> 08,01oh god
<AJIsHaunter> Saturn: ?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Of course, Bowser gets the fancy doors
<Canadian_Brony> I was thinking about getting this game when I get a Wii U, but if SB can get 99 lives by the time he reaches the final boss, chances are I'd rack up lives faster than Super Mario 3D Land.
<BladedWings> oh look what time it it ^_^
<StuffCrusader> duuuuun duuuuuun duuuun..
*PrincessCholestrolia plays a zelda theme
<the_real_pony_1604> does...... does he have 97 lives?
<CrazyHippie> yup
<AJIsHaunter> the_real_pony_1604: Yep.
<NocturnalBlade> what up Saturn?
<CriticKitten> ....really? XD
<StuffCrusader> BOWSAH
<Canadian_Brony> the_real_pony_1604 yes, this game BS's lives like 3D Land.
<CrazyHippie> lol original last battle
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I hope things are okay with Saturn :(
<SpadeKyurem[R]> THE AXE
<weeping_pegasi82> BOWZA!!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> THE AXE
<CriticKitten> lol, yep
<CrazyHippie> Skele Bowser?
<CrazyHippie> awww
<Canadian_Brony> hey, where'd Saturn go?
<NocturnalBlade> well that worked lol
<AJIsHaunter> Bowser. WHY would you have that axe and switch there?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> He just suddenly left
<SpadeKyurem[R]> That was easy
<AJIsHaunter> .........
<Kandarihu> No way is it going to end with that
<PrincessCholestrolia> my favotite battles are races.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> HERE WE GO AGAIN
<RDash5000> oh dear
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> Now make my monster GROW *MMPR theme* :D
<StuffCrusader> *yeah pegasus* YEAH!!!
<AJIsHaunter> OH NO.
<weeping_pegasi82> uh on
<weeping_pegasi82> *oh
<CrazyHippie> I hated that wizard in Yoshis Island...
<AJIsHaunter> OOOOOOOOH NO.
<NocturnalBlade> Suicune_Toku_Brony: :D yes
<StuffCrusader> waita tick
<AssaultWithEmbraces> OH COME ON!!!!!
<PrincessCholestrolia> I can outrun even RD in my GTR
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> NocturnalBlade: We needs Elements of Harmony NOW :D
<weeping_pegasi82> peach can go die in a hole!
<RDash5000> ITS A TRAP
<CriticKitten> OGOD
<J_E_Smith71> Is this going to be any different than the NSMB Wii final giant Bowser thing?
<StuffCrusader> O_O
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Peach never seems to cry for help when she's kidnapped
<CrazyHippie> well then...
<AJIsHaunter> ..........
<weeping_pegasi82> HOLY MEGA BOWZER!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> We're fucked.
<CriticKitten> Oh that's just not fair
<CrazyHippie> so anti climactic
<AJIsHaunter> This fight proves that graphics in this game are FANTASTIC.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> You died...to the mook
<NocturnalBlade> Suicune_Toku_Brony: *sends out the Elements as Megazords lol
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> 95 LIVES LATER...:D
<NocturnalBlade> *
<AJIsHaunter> Especially Bowser's model.
<StuffCrusader> and they through him out of the castle screamign NO SOUP FOR YOU, COME BACK TWO YEAR
<PrincessCholestrolia> lol
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> NocturnalBlade: FRIENDSHIP ZORD ACTIVATED :D oh god this so oatmeal
<Canadian_Brony> J_E_Smith71 slightly, it seems. I find it kinda funny how I had more trouble getting to Bowser than defeating him (twice)
<CriticKitten> ded
<NocturnalBlade> Suicune_Toku_Brony: i love it :D
<RDash5000> mario vs. albert wesker. begin!
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> NocturnalBlade: i remember seeing someone made a concept for Ponigers with Dash as Pony Blue :D
<AssaultWithEmbraces> SpadeKyurem[R]: Now you know why Bowser likes lava. In the chance that Mario gets to him, he just takes a quick dip and he's mega.
<Canadian_Brony> "Alright men, we need an original final boss!" *something original* -__-
<J_E_Smith71> Seems you can't one shot Bowser either, in NSMB 2 you can just Gold Flower him, and in the first NSMB if you had a Mega Mushroom instant death
<StuffCrusader> ಠ_ಠ
<Canadian_Brony> *Giant Bowser* :O
<PrincessCholestrolia> Q: Where do you live? A: Earth.
<NocturnalBlade> Suicune_Toku_Brony: lol nice, would love to see it
<CriticKitten> OH GOD
<AJIsHaunter> ...............
<AJIsHaunter> WHAT.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> WHY
<CrazyHippie> OP
<SpadeKyurem[R]> How are you supposed to kill this guy normally?
<CriticKitten> HE MAD
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NERF! NOW!
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeKyurem[R] wait it out probably.
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: I think it has something to do with Baby Bowser.
<weeping_pegasi82> IT'S RAININ FIRE~
<NocturnalBlade> give him a hot foot
<PrincessCholestrolia> cant see, iPhone dumbo
<Canadian_Brony> no, probably Bob-ombs
<J_E_Smith71> Oh Bob-Ombs so that's how you do it normally I bet
<weeping_pegasi82> oh no he lost his fire!
<Canadian_Brony> le gasp
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Now things get interesting
<NocturnalBlade> now he mad
<Canadian_Brony> he'll have to resort to . . . STRATEGY
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And now it's raining fireballs
<AssaultWithEmbraces> zippidy doo-fucking-da
<jcelios> He'll have to use.... MATH
<CriticKitten> NICE
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I think you have to jump on bowser jr
<PrincessCholestrolia> l.
<Kandarihu> Wow, awesome
<AJIsHaunter> Nice.
<CrazyHippie> Go home Bowser. You're drunk
<weeping_pegasi82> bowser ded
<RDash5000> jcelios: DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
<Canadian_Brony> and then he ied
<CriticKitten> ded
<Canadian_Brony> *died
<Canadian_Brony> what about Jr?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oh Bowser, why are you sooo overdramatic.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Now THAT was a Bowser battle :D
<StuffCrusader> veeery ded
<CrazyHippie> Giant Skele Bowser?
<AJIsHaunter> SuperBrony64: SURE was. :D
<LadyCanary> Aw, he's a lil one.

<RDash5000> >rape
<SpadeKyurem[R]> My stream just teleported
<AssaultWithEmbraces> inb4 "Sory Mario"
<Tovler> Jen Taylor is voicing Peach again?
<AJIsHaunter> Wait, did she just kiss his hat?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> NOW TRY A NEW QUEST
<PrincessCholestrolia> Koenigsegg Agera R VS Volkswagen Beetle
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 dude, I've seen a better Bowser boss from the Mario Party story modes.
<LadyCanary> HEY, he at least deserves a mouth kiss at least ;_;
<SpadeKyurem[R]> How the fuck did they get rid of the lava so fast?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Awww, there goes the real estate
<Tovler> Now all the Koopas will have mario masks?
<weeping_pegasi82> fireball it!
<LadyCanary> After all the crap he's been through.
<Kandarihu> SpadeKyurem[R], magical lack of ontological inertia
<CriticKitten> And that's how they all died
<Canadian_Brony> crash 'n burn
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeKyurem[R]: I guess killing Bowser just drains the lava however that works
<AssaultWithEmbraces> LadyCanary, he deserve more than that imo.
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> NocturnalBlade: yeah heres the concept for Pony Blue aka Dash :D so neat http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&global=1&q=mlp+super+sentai#/d4l0yoq

<SpadeKyurem[R]> I was wondering where you were
<Canadian_Brony> >Airship: can't hold Giant Bowser +Koopalings

*NocturnalBlade dances
<Tovler> GRR. Update already, WiiU
<AJIsHaunter> And ONE, and TWO, and ONE and TWO and THREE and FOUR!
<PrincessCholestrolia> ponies kept sayin ur my fav pony, Saturn
<NocturnalBlade> Suicune_Toku_Brony: :D
<Canadian_Brony> never did take a liking to much of the music in the NSMB series
<NocturnalBlade> what kind of funny mood Saturn ?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I have to wonder....
<StuffCrusader> brb everypony i
<Canadian_Brony> Galaxy, however . . .
<StuffCrusader> ll be back in about thirty minutes
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Do the toads feel pain when Mario jumps on them?
<Canadian_Brony> seeya StuffCrusader
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye StuffCrusader
<RDash5000> AssaultWithEmbraces: pssssh. pain
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: I think their heads are shock absorbers? :D
<NocturnalBlade> bye StuffCrusader
<weeping_pegasi82> lots and lots of people
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, but wouldn't it hurt anyways? Those are just the hats. Suppose one of them jumps a little *too* hard?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Their head might get crushed.
<weeping_pegasi82> Mario is so greedy bouncing off their heads and possibly killing them for some stupid coincs
<weeping_pegasi82> *coins
<SpadeKyurem[R]> What is Mushrooms are decapitated Toad heads?
<jcelios> they are *shiny* coins
<NocturnalBlade> AssaultWithEmbraces: they seem happy with it lol
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Consperacyreeves.jpg
<Kandarihu> Congratulations, SuperBrony64
<SpadeKyurem[R]> *If
<weeping_pegasi82> congrats
<AJIsHaunter> Nice playthrough, SuperBrony64. :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Congrats, SB~
<thelonecubone> Congratulations SB84 :3
<NocturnalBlade> yay sb
<spitfirecolt> congrats sb
<jcelios> yay :)
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64: Course now you get all the Star Coins and I bet there's some secret world now
<Canadian_Brony> IMO Galaxy 3 would've been a better launch title. You have a revolutionary controller, so the launch titles should showcase it's abilities. NSMB is a 2D sidescroller. That's very limited. The gamepad being a secondary screen is convenient, but you don't really /do/ anything with it.
<Canadian_Brony> And don't get me started on the music...
<CriticKitten> The gamepad enables Boost Mode in multiplayer.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Anyhoo, back to playing Sticker Star
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Huzzah
<CriticKitten> Or as I prefer to call it, Troll Mode
<Tovler> Beats the hell out of NSMB2 *shudders*
<Canadian_Brony> Galaxy has a FUCKING ORCHESTRA!!!
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> man 2BFs Play NSMB U was hilarious :D
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The fuck is boost mode?
<thelonecubone> twixie_sprinkle: http://derpibooru.org/172389
<Tovler> SM3DL has original and catchy music
<AJIsHaunter> And I STILL need to beat Kid Icarus Uprising's Boss Rush on HARD mode. *shudders*
<CriticKitten> It's like normal mode, except that the gamepad player can create platforms for the players and other stuff
<SpadeKyurem[R]> CriticKitten: So NSMB Wii trolling up to eleven?
<twixie_sprinkle> thelonecubone: not bad, although im not a fan of ponies with guns
<CriticKitten> And I have to admit it IS kinda cool, but it's MAJOR troll material
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeKyurem[R] think of NSMB Wii, 4 player mode, where everyone is throwing each other into danger. Now, imagine that with a 5th player making platforms appear out of thin air.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Multiplayer mario isnt co-op
<CriticKitten> Because the gamepad person can put platforms in your way to spite you
<SpadeKyurem[R]> its chaos
<CriticKitten> XD
<CriticKitten> It made for an awesome episode of Two Best Friends.
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeKyurem[R] "Chaos awaits. Bring friends." (Borderlands 2)
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> CriticKitten: yes it did :D
<Canadian_Brony> (Also applies to NSMB Wii/U)
<thelonecubone> twixie_sprinkle: ah, i see
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So 4 player is less co=op and more dickery?
<CriticKitten> "My job is to screw you all with my Platforms of Destiny!"
<thelonecubone> SpadeKyurem[R]: you could say that
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't understand how Mario Party games are described as the games that friendships are lost overr
<SpadeKyurem[R]> You can be really dickish to each other
<CriticKitten> It has the potential to be a really great party game.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Really dickish
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeKyurem[R] implying anyone co-operated in 4p
<CriticKitten> But if you want, it can also have the potential to end friendships
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Then again, I've never played a Mario Party game because I never had a Gamecube
<NocturnalBlade> or an n64?
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> i thought that was Monopoly's job :D
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Watch Pokecapn's mario party lps
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NocturnalBlade: nope
<SpadeKyurem[R]> It shows you how bad it gets
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<AJIsHaunter> :O
<thelonecubone> what?
<Tovler> Mario Party was the original CoD. A new MP every year or 2.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> also, I just finished Two Best Friends Play Heavy Rain today
<thelonecubone> :O
<Suicune_Toku_Brony> Tovler: :D
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I hated Mario party 1
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64 SpadeKyurem[R]: An example of trolling someone with the Gamepad: http://cdn.brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comics/2012-11-30-451-HintsfromtheMiiverse.jpg
<SpadeKyurem[R]> My hand
<Canadian_Brony> AssaultWithEmbraces get a Gamecube, buy 4 controllers for it, buy a memory card, buy ALL the Mario Parties for it, grab 3 friends (7 for MP7) and PLAY IT AAALLLLLL NIIIIIGGGHHHT!!!!!
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: I LOVED MP1.

<thelonecubone> AJIsHaunter: your argument is invalid
<HoodEvee> No legendaries
<Haku1013> TECHINICALLY
<Haku1013> He's not a legendary
<AJIsHaunter> Gary's always one step ahead of you. No exceptions.
<HoodEvee> He's listed as a legendary
<HoodEvee> He counts
<Haku1013> Born from a science experiment, no one knows of him
<Haku1013> fuck you and your pokemon logic
<thelonecubone> but he's a Genetic code from a Legendary pokemon
<Haku1013> but nevertheless
<HoodEvee> AJIsHaunter: What if I trip Gary
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but everyone knows of him in the games :P
<Haku1013> Ill choose someone else

<AJIsHaunter> Bye, texasboykc09. :)
<Randomnerd> Mmm -Andouille.
<Randomnerd> Bye, texasboykc09
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: the furry fandom is more about being an anthropomorphic something than it is about having actual fur
<Raichu1013> Random Nerds are best nerds
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You know what I haven't had in a while?
<Kinixys> Saturn: Morphic planes.. Hah! There's actually a few animations with plane characters I believe.
<Saturn> 08,01i once knew an anthropomorphic hamburger
<stallion1> NERDS
<Raichu1013> yum
<Saturn> 08,01and an anthropomorphic bag of flower
<weylin|Blarg> Anthropomorphic rocks, for example
<DitzyDerpy15> ponies because ponies?
<Buytoast> welp, i'm baffled
<Saturn> 08,01stallion1: yes?
<Buytoast> my puzzler is all puzzled out
*HoodEvee places a plant on Buytoast's head

<HoodEvee> Ofcourse they are
<stallion1> they are mostly funny

<CrystalPhoenix> Buytoast, some hot toast and toaster action
<HoodEvee> You have to use them right, though
<Randomnerd> "Puns were once the highest form of humor, Soo-keh!"
<Saturn> 08,01DaringDerpy: i just laughed so hard that i nearly wet myself
<stallion1> yes its all in da moment

<JRP2234> BFG is best weapon
<Buytoast> "Extra crispy.
*Jmo huggles aniderp|bestcakeever
<Saturn> 08,01honestly, i think the thought of people RPing Brave Little Toaster is adorable
*Randomnerd wanders off muttering "Sookeh!"
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, come on, it's not like we can say there's anythign out of order about RPing a world based on a children's cartoon...
<Saturn> 08,01let he who has no OC cast the first stone :P

<Yahooz> well... this convo definently made a turn for the wierder
<Saturn> 08,01CrystalPhoenix: yes, i did
<Buytoast> comet moth

<CrystalPhoenix> was he already in his moth obsession when you met him?
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: yup; large yellow saturniid moth

<CrystalPhoenix> his blog is basically a moth gallery now
<Saturn> 08,01i don't think i started it...
<Mutterdude> AssaultWithEmbraces was it due to the genderbender belt that is buried within most D&D editions?
<Saturn> 08,01i hardly had a chance to speak with him at BUCK
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music of the Day #34
<stallion1> alrite I'll leave ya to it be back tomorrow at 7ish, maby bty EQD!!!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Mutterdude, nope. Not related to DnD at all. It was my OC and someone else's. He wanted to be a female and thus it happened.
<Blarg_of_Flarg> Huh
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Don't ask
<stallion1> how long will the music last?
*AssaultWithEmbraces slow dances with herself to the song
<Saturn> 08,01i'm completely obsessed with moths

<Buytoast> the thunder's been called
<AJIsHaunter> Eddmario: Implying everyone's seen the guide info
<Buytoast> and it needs to strike
<Kinixys> Eddmario: I avoid even the guide or episode synopsis.
<CrystalPhoenix> Eddmario, some people do not check those things
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Eddmario, it's a spoiler if you disscuss it here.
<Jmo> Wow. Eddmario, thanks for ruining it.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> AJIsHaunter: Do I even want to know what I missed when I went to take a shower?
<Shizuka> 13i love how the fire pops in time with the music
<twixie_sprinkle> >tv guide
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: I have no idea, either.

<HoodEvee> Calm the fuck down

<twixie_sprinkle> stream is down
<Blarg_of_Flarg> I see no log
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So I assumed you were done
<Eddmario> Shizuka: There's a stream? I thought it was the new stream embed's "no stream right now" screensaver
<Shizuka> 13i
<Shizuka> 13hate
<Shizuka> 13this
<Shizuka> 13program
<Kinixys> HoodEvee: I think the overall reaction to Magic Duel has been the most positive.
<HoodEvee> It hates you too
<Eddmario> So, did anyone watch Attack of the Show today?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Eddmario: Take pics if possible and tell us all about it so I can envy in envy

<Kinixys> These fires could put a person in the mood for Morrowind.
<Eddmario> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/12/1/tLkL9oBOJUCa-I7GI0OMXQ2.png
<Kinixys> Cause with how many there are in the game, everytime I see a fire I think of it. XD
<Eddmario> Kinixys: That reminds me, has anybody gotten a chance to play the new Skyrim DLC that came out today? I'm waiting til after x-mas to get it as I might be getting cash, gift cards, or ms points for it.
<Eddmario> Please, no spoilers. Just say if it's as epic as Dawnguard was.
*sub06905 dances
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The fuck is a chia?
<Blarg_of_Flarg> Chia-pet
<Kinixys> chia-pet I guess. the pottery that grows?
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: You have no idea what a Chia is? :D
<Eddmario> SpadeKyurem[R]: I take it you never heard of Chia Pets?
<Blarg_of_Flarg> that plant thing
<Saturn> 08,01Eddmario: i used to think it was
<Saturn> 08,01then i took an arrow to the knee

<weeping_ninetales82> it's the chia chia chia chia-pet!~
<Shizuka> 13for some reason i think this part is saturn's theme song
<sub06905> lel
<weeping_ninetales82> lol
<Kencolt> Chia-pet. A small pottery animal (usually), hollow and filled with water, and spread with small seends of a simple plant that gorws in it's grooved surface. Basically, an almost foolproof indoor decoration.
<Eddmario> Shizuka: If it involves booze, then probably.
<Saturn> 08,01Ryunosuke: the hell?
<Saturn> 08,01is that pony inspired?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Ryunosuke: Da fuck am I looking at?
<Saturn> 08,01or something else completely?
<Kinixys> Eddmario: Well... I'm a bit behind playing Morrowind for the first time, but I guess it would be pretty cool to revist Solstheim.
<Kecleondarihu> Ah, I remember seeing TV ads for Chia pets all the time.
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<Saturn> 08,01because there's 6 of them, and i can see how each would be one of the mane 6
<Eddmario> Kencolt: And just like everything else you can orderon the phone, they're not as accurate at all.
<Blarg_of_Flarg> I think it's all the characters in anime that are in wheelchairs, Saturn
<Ryunosuke> para-redline(?)
<Blarg_of_Flarg> at least popular ones
<Ryunosuke> its kinda cool
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Blarg_of_Flarg: Facinating
<Saturn> 08,01okay, going left to right
<weeping_ninetales82> nice music
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Are these logs ever going to burn out?
<Saturn> 08,01pinkie pie, rainbow dash, rarity, applejack, twilight sparkle, fluttershy
<Saturn> 08,01how'd i do?
<NocturnalBlade> aaaaand i return :) did i miss anything?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm willing to say those last two could be swapped
<Ryunosuke> well its drawn in the style that Redline is, but it still a cool pic
<Saturn> 08,01though she does have a mechanical hand
<AJIsHaunter> Welcome back, NocturnalBlade. I don't think you missed much. :)
<Saturn> 08,01so that could be "maic"
<Saturn> 08,01*magic
<Eddmario> SpadeKyurem[R]: I don't think so, since they're made from Netherrack...
<Randomnerd> hm
<Eddmario> Shizuka: How bout throwing some gasoline onto the fire?

<Shizuka> 13i think i've seen a live show maybe once...
<Kecleondarihu> Oh, riverdance
<Kencolt> I saw the riverdance guys on PBS years ago. May have been just TV, but it was remarkable.
<Shizuka> 13was an orchestra playing mostly dvorak iirc
<Shizuka> 13i have seen the video of the riverdance album though
<Ryunosuke> twixie_sprinkle: apparently it is in order from left to right Yui and Hinata (angel beats), Ayame Jinjuuji (Ga-Rei), Jean Havoc (FMA Brotherhood), Margo (Casshern Sins), Nunnally (Code Geass)
<Shizuka> 13they crazy

<Saturn> 08,01the funniest ones involve flat vowels followed by soft consonants
<AJIsHaunter> Um, what?
<Canadian_Brony> Bon Bon. Go home. You're drunk.
<HoodEvee> She looks pissed
<HoodEvee> Should I be scared?
<AJIsHaunter> HoodEvee: I have no idea, honestly.
<Saturn> 08,01bum, fondler, mufler
<Saturn> 08,01*muffler
<Saturn> 08,01i kjeep spelling that wrong...
<Shizuka> 13it's just a liiiiiittle too slow
<Saturn> 08,01maybe the funniest ones have those balanced out with harsher souds too
<sub06905> dat lyra
<Canadian_Brony> o____O
<Saturn> 08,01a good example: bum tickler
<HoodEvee> I wish I could dance like that ;~;
<DitzyDerpy15> show trixie doing carameldansen
<Vordox> Inb4 Shizuka plays something unexpected
<AJIsHaunter> Is this a pony parody of an anime dance?
<Saturn> 08,01they're not funny because of the meaning of the words, they're funny because of the sounds
<HoodEvee> Vordox: Too late
<Shizuka> 13yes i'm looking for every animation in /r/mylittlepony <<
<Saturn> 08,01and they all follow more or less the same cadence and rules of construction and balance
<Vordox> Shizuka: Careful..
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, there's a bit of humour theory for you; hope you've learned something
<DitzyDerpy15> adobe flash player CRASHED
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn I can only think of ones that end in "cocksucker". Is that bad?
<DitzyDerpy15> WHEELS
<DitzyDerpy15> XD
<AssaultWithEmbraces> The wheels
<Vordox> <.... LAWL
<SpadeKyurem[R]> MY GOD

<HoodEvee> WHEELS
*HoodEvee runs away
<Kimori> I'm just going to work on it tomorrow morning
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So is Wheels a new meme now?
<sub06905> here: http://iambrony.jsmart.web.id/mlp/gif/30194__safe_animated_lyra_spiderman.gif
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I believe so
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: that's not a very good one in this context because it have too many harsh "k" sounds, and no balance
<Kimori> hopefully I wont regret doing it, goodnight Afflict :)
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeKyurem[R] a new BronyState meme is created every 17 seconds.
<Kecleondarihu> SpadeKyurem[R], I guess so too
<Saturn> 08,01maybe if you pair it with a 2 syllable word with soft souds, it'll work
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So how many meme have we created?
<Vordox> Saturn: Bloody Mary Sue Gillick Git.
<AJIsHaunter> sub06905: Cue SMW credits
<HoodEvee> mother cocksucker?
<DitzyDerpy15> dude stop it..
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn dammit, I like to use that insult...
<AJIsHaunter> ........
<SpadeKyurem[R]> And how many have we run into the ground?
<AJIsHaunter> Um, maybe we're taking this a bit too far.
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: actually, this is why the word "fucking" is such a good expletive
<DitzyDerpy15> trixie dancing carameldansen FTW lol
<Canadian_Brony> xD
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: So far, G** IIRC.
<sub06905> AJIsHaunter: i dunt get it :I
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Does "I blme Sxyprtdr" count as a meme?
<Nippony> GAK had so much potential. ToT
<Saturn> 08,01it has a lot of balance in its sound
<DitzyDerpy15> T_T not G@K
<SpadeKyurem[R]> AJIsHaunter: The world record holder for the fastest meme made and killed
<Vordox> Nippony: I see wat ur name iz
<Canadian_Brony> maybe that's why I like to say "fuck" alot.
<AJIsHaunter> Nippony: I never saw it having any potential.
<Canadian_Brony> That, or because I'm a teenager :p
<SpadeKyurem[R]> We created a meme and killed it in less than 24 hours
<NullRadix> and then intellectual discussion about swear words
<Nippony> Haha.. just found out not to say that.
<Nippony> the g-word
<Vordox> <---- LAWL
<DitzyDerpy15> XD
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Dat scootaloo face
<AssaultWithEmbraces> That Scootaloo
<Canadian_Brony> Scootaloo: "DEEEERRRRRP!!!"
<DitzyDerpy15> lawl applebloom, scootalo and sweetie belle?
<AJIsHaunter> :D
<DitzyDerpy15> scootaloo*
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: actually, because it starts with 2 very soft sounds (f and uh), and continues to the same "k" sound, it can be very effecively paired with "cocksucker"
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Applejack doesnt put up with this shit
<DitzyDerpy15> XD
<Nippony> If only this was a screensaver
<DitzyDerpy15> Applejack was tired XD
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<Canadian_Brony> and AJ's like "I'm surrounded by idiots"
<DitzyDerpy15> dafuq
<SpadeKyurem[R]> PONIIIII
<DitzyDerpy15> POOOOOONY
<Saturn> 08,01let's try this... "mint mashing fucking cocksucker"
<Vordox> Shizuka: Can't find the "Ladybug" dance Twi does? XD
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Thats all I hear when I listen to this music or what ever
<DitzyDerpy15> AW YOU RUINED THE GOOD TIME
<DitzyDerpy15> and i got kicked again
<Vordox> Saturn: Too hardat the end
<Saturn> 08,01maybe not so well
<HoodEvee> Saturn: Are you creating things to say when you stub your toe?
<AJIsHaunter> Saturn: :S

<SpadeKyurem[R]> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8iv9hFqeH1r30tino1_500.gif
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn ok ok, gimme a minute to experiment with a few 1 syllable swear words and I'll get back to you in a minute.
<Saturn> 08,01maybe just "fucking cocksucker" on its own is good enough
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, i like that
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: :D
<Nippony> I just got the "Pooniiiii" thing.. now I see why this song works so well.
<DitzyDerpy15> :D
<Vordox> Saturn: Isn't it too many hard r and ks?
<Saturn> 08,01especially if it's really out of the blue
<Canadian_Brony> "You fucking cocksucker"
<Canadian_Brony> that's my new catchphrase
*SpadeKyurem[R] spawns a wheelbarrel
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: in my opinion, it works better without the "you"
<Saturn> 08,01and in a posh english accent
*HoodEvee cuts off the wheel
<Saturn> 08,01then again, lots of things are funny in a posh english accent
<DitzyDerpy15> so whats the song called?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> UNTZ
<Vordox> DitzyDerpy15: Call ON Me
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Or PONIIIIIIIIIII
<SpadeKyurem[R]> What ever you prefer
<Canadian_Brony> I'll have to get my friend to try that. He can do such a good posh accent. I can only do irish.
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i think the repetition of the "k" (rule of 3's), and the balance of the u's and the f make it good
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Gimme 20$
<Vordox> Saturn: But there's 4 k?
<Saturn> 08,01curses, i miscounted
<DitzyDerpy15> PonyPonyPonyPony.swf

<Canadian_Brony> -_^
<Saturn> 08,01so even if there *are* people from the UK in here, i can't nerd out about shared childhood experiences
<Saturn> 08,01because English people never got to experience The Singing Kettle

<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: ha!

<naturesfury> forward in time or backwards
<Saturn> 08,01"wither butter, cheese or jelly, if the bread is plain or bran / the odds against it reaching earth are ninety nine tae wan"

<Unnr> Saturn: Dark magic
<Blarg_of_Flarg> o.o
<Vordox> Thanks for streaming Shizuka =3
<Canadian_Brony> she's not done yet
<Shizuka> 13this is fun
<Unnr> Saturn: I actually own a copy of The Merry Muses of Caledonia
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: it never ceases to amaze me how much you know about pretty much everything
<Canadian_Brony> oh boy, I know what you're about to do Shizu
<Canadian_Brony> slow it down at just the right time...
<Canadian_Brony> right?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I hate these ads interupt my stream viewing
<Unnr> Saturn: Its all Daaaark magggic
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Going to be such a bitch during pony episodes
<twixie_sprinkle> if only there were any browser applications to prevent ads
<DitzyDerpy15> PYRO IS THINKING WITH PORTALS
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeKyurem[R] Adblock Plus. If you have IE, get Chrome or Firefox THEN Adblock Plus.
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: i remember having to memorise and recite Burns in primary school
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I never minded the ads before but Im not getting fucking adblock
<Saturn> 08,01it's one of those standard scottish things
<DitzyDerpy15> BRB again play MW3
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[R]: Then good luck, then.
<Canadian_Brony> inb4 scariest damn thing you will ever see
<SpadeKyurem[R]> These how ever get annoying with the fact they stop the stream and just play a un skippable ad
<Saturn> 08,01see kids, this is why scotland is awesome
<Kencolt> SpadeKyurem[R]: Why on earth not?
<Saturn> 08,01we have Rabbie Fucking Burns.
<Unnr> Saturn: Ther real question is can you cook a haggis? Its such a bitch trying to catch one gallumphing across the highlands.
<Saturn> 08,01(and MacGonagall...)
<Laurayne> Hello Everypony
<Unnr> (and the whole of Hogwarts)
<NocturnalBlade> hi Laurayne
<Unnr> Hiiiii Laurayne
<Vordox> There, NOW I say thanks for streaming Shizuka XD
<Unnr> o/
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: i used to cycle past that school in edinburgh every day
<Laurayne> Is That A New Stream Box?
<NocturnalBlade> Thanks for the warmth and music Shizuka ^_^
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, Laurayne. :)
<Canadian_Brony> Thank you Shizuka for the always awesome stream.
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: also, the trick is either to chase the haggis the wrong way round a mountain, or to dig a pit and place an open bottle of whiskey inside it
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I mean really, Im not going to get ad blocker for something Im only going to use like one a week
<AJIsHaunter> I use Adblocker all the time.
<AdamThePsyduck> Dat bass
<Canadian_Brony> YouTube ads (even in-video), pop-ups, stupid pull-downs, videos, crap that covers up the game you're about to click on.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Thanks for the steam, Shizuka
<Vordox> <--- Whaaat...theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<SpadeKyurem[R]> This is why i liked Mips and LimeV because the ads didnt fucking fully interupt the stream
<Shizuka> 13media player makes this so epic when slowed down half speed
<sub06905> tnx for stream Shizuka
<Vordox> Shizuka: I think it sounds scary XD
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I could actually see and hear the stream while dealing with the ad
<twixie_sprinkle> SpadeKyurem[R]: yes we get it
<Kencolt> Saturn: FEH. I may not be-- technically-- Scots, but I am of Scots ancestry, of Clan MdDonald to be precise, and I know for a fact that what a Haggid is is basically a boiled sausage made of parts that... some... might find offputting. (Myself, I think it tastes OK, if a bit meh, if underseasoned.)
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #516
<SpadeKyurem[R]> 1?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The hell was that
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: mostly lungs, liver, mince, and oats
<AdamThePsyduck> Thanks for the music Shizuka :)
<Saturn> 08,01maybe some heart too
<Saturn> 08,01all good stuff
<twixie_sprinkle> ustream works on phones, which is awesome imo
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeKyurem[R] it's for idenifying your monitors if you're dualing.
<Saturn> 08,01and, of course, spices and seasoning
<Kencolt> Nothing wrong with hearts and liver-- or mince. Always been a bit off about lungs tho.
<Saturn> 08,01well, it's all edible
<Saturn> 08,01and delicious
<Unnr> Saturn: and don´t forget the jigger of whisky, you can´t cook a proper haggis without it being slightly drunk
<Saturn> 08,01dmanit, now i want haggis...
<Kencolt> Lungs are gristle. And damn near nothing else. ENVER found a lung I liked.
<Unnr> Just don´t, for the love of all that is holy, buy a tinned one
<Kencolt> NEVER.
<Saturn> 08,01eeew, tinned haggis...
<Unnr> nothing is more foul than mass produced tinned haggis
<Unnr> *shudder*
<Canadian_Brony> d'aaaaawwww...
<Saturn> 08,01that's almost as bad as tinned black pudding
<AdamThePsyduck> It's so cuuuuuuute :3
<Unnr> Gahhhh
<NocturnalBlade> daaaaaaaaw its tooooooo cuuuuuute~
<Unnr> Just say no Saturn
<AJIsHaunter> Does anyone remember the English Dragon Ball theme song EXTREMELY catchy?
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsHaunter: i think so?
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: if i find anyone eating that crap, i'll beat them to death with what's under my kilt
<Kencolt> Unnr: OF course there is. There's home-made haggis made by someone who doesn't know how to DO IT RIGHT. Now, THAT'S a horrible thing.
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn oh, oh gawd, oh GAWD!!
<jcelios> scottish people are scary.... :o
<Unnr> Saturn: you mean a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow?
<Unnr> jcelios: you are just jelly of the Irn Bru
<jcelios> I might be, if I knew what it was
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: i just laughed into my tea
<Saturn> 08,01almost spittake
<Saturn> 08,01almost
<Unnr> jcelios: its made in Scotland, from girders
<jcelios> reading wiki now
<jcelios> looks.... interesting?
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn do that again, except with a mouthful of Co-errr, Irn Bru, and spit it all over your monitor which you cleaned recently for the same reason.
<Canadian_Brony> then spill it on your keyboard
<Canadian_Brony> twice
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: i once spat out irn bru all over my friend's white cat
<Saturn> 08,01by accident
<Canadian_Brony> xDD
<Unnr> Canadian_Brony: That sounds like experience talking
<Saturn> 08,01it was stained orange for a week
<Kencolt> Actually, not tat I think of it, it's less a sausage and more a pudding-- in the boiled savory pudding sense-- what with all those oats taking up space. Except in a bladder or stomach, rather than a cloth or bag.
<Unnr> Saturn: oh gods, hehehehehehehe
<Chrysalis> Saturn cats are better orange
<Canadian_Brony> Unnr I'm just a fountain of (ir)relavent personal experience stories.
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: aye, it's ap udding
<Canadian_Brony> what is ap udding?
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<Kencolt> Saturn: It's just... a pudding that is VERY like a sausage.
<Unnr> Canadian_Brony: Its like a pudding, but with tourettes
<Canadian_Brony> and tourettes are . . ?
<Canadian_Brony> wait, I'll just google it
<Unnr> a type of soft cheese
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: tiny elves that spread swearing
<Unnr> Saturn: Like the smurfs? Could never trust the blue freaks
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn and the big ones are called teenagers, I presume.
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: you've just reminded me how much i want to re-watch Donnie Darko
<Saturn> 08,0106:10 <@Saturn> Canadian_Brony: a long time ago, in a galaxy far away
<Saturn> 08,0106:10 < SpadeKyurem[R]> What bullshit
<Saturn> 08,0106:10 -!- AJIsHaunter is now known as AJIsHaunter|AFK
<Saturn> 08,0106:10 <@Saturn> there lived 3 skeletons
<Saturn> 08,0106:11 <@Saturn> a big skeleton
<Saturn> 08,0106:11 <@Saturn> a little skeleton
<Kencolt> Well I have to be going-- dentures adjustment tomorrow morning. Sigh.
<Saturn> 08,0106:11 <@Saturn> and a dog skeleton
<Saturn> 08,01whoops

<Chrysalis> cant remember the name of the damn host
<Saturn> 08,01aye; i don't have any zip files anywhere here
<SkunkTauri> Saturn: has there been anymore Evangelion streams lately

<Polydunami> Do you like our new stream embed?
<Starchaser> yes
<Laurayne> Yes
<NocturnalBlade> i like the slide show ^_^
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter: thought you might like this, has organ and thnderstorm
<Polydunami> Yeah, that's a neat feature
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUxMoQ-Xi2U
<Pinkies4thWall> So, does anypony have Borderlands 2 for Xbox?
<Pinkies4thWall> Cause i'm bored
<Laurayne> And Ive Been Layed Up For 3 Days Sick. I Can Spare Some Time Online. In Getting So Stur Crazy Being Cooped Up
<Polydunami> Yeah, say what you will about Naruto; the show has very good music
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<Starchaser> i got the dbz budokai hd pack yesterday
<twixie_sprinkle> Polydunami: i especially like that they use some interesting and unique instruments i never hear anywhere else
<Starchaser> its good but they changed the music for budokai 3
<Polydunami> Can you name some of them?
<Polydunami> I'm pretty sure I've heard the shakuhachi from different animes.
<twixie_sprinkle> Polydunami: i have no idea what they are unfortunately. one is a wind instrument, the other a string, thats all i know
<Polydunami> Oh, the shamisen
<Polydunami> You'd probably know what they were by the sounds rather than the names.
<Laurayne> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/27/CGczqTJRQ0qxo8VVWtY2Zw2.png
<twixie_sprinkle> yeah im searchinh them up on youtube :P
<twixie_sprinkle> yeah shamisen sounds like it
<twixie_sprinkle> shakuhachi sounds about the same too
<Polydunami> Yeah, I kind of have a thing for music :$
<twixie_sprinkle> i finished music school on guitar and remember nothing at all >.>
<Polydunami> Well, you've still got the ear for different instruments
<twixie_sprinkle> yeah, one thing i think ive retained is some music analysis techniques, although thats not very useful with most modern music as theres not much to analyze in them..
<Randomnerd> Sleep... I should try that.
<twixie_sprinkle> not in the general pop at least
<twixie_sprinkle> unfortunately i never finished learning to play this on the guitar and havent icked it up since i finished http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfFbuT3I6A
<twixie_sprinkle> finished music school i mean
<wipergone2> Bigcheese: hi
<Polydunami> Bloop
<Bigcheese> Hi wipergone2.
<Polydunami> Not much of a talkative group here, huh?
<incog> werdz
<AJIsHaunter> It's pretty late at night. :D
<Polydunami> Why are you that.
<twixie_sprinkle> its pretty late...
<twixie_sprinkle> AT NIGHT
<incog> i can get a conversation started, how do you feel about this
<incog> http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/12/03/gnaa_tumblr_worm_trolling_group_says_it_was_targeting_bronies.html
<incog> http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/dec/03/tumblr-cyber-worm-anti-blogging
<Polydunami> I don't even know why we're listening to this.
<incog> we can have a sensible and mature discussion
<Polydunami> Who told you to change your name to incog, anyway?
<incog> it is my name
<Jmo> Oh this kid again
<AJIsHaunter> Jmo: ?
<Jmo> Don't you have better things to do?
<Bigcheese> incog: I didn't even notice.
<incog> what better things would these be, Jmo
<Jmo> You tell me.
<incog> do you have an example?
<wipergone2> gnaa
<Jmo> It's your life.
<Jmo> Surely you have one other thing to do.
<incog> its not my arguement
<Jmo> It isn't an arguement.
<Jmo> But surely you have better things to do then running around pretending to be a part of GNAA
<twixie_sprinkle> wut
<wipergone2> Jmo: huh
<twixie_sprinkle> when was he pretending to be gnaa
<incog> i can assure you, im not pretending
<Polydunami> Cool story
<twixie_sprinkle> incog: so youre part of gnaa?
<incog> yes, orginal 2002 crew
<twixie_sprinkle> incog: and youre still a part of it?
<Polydunami> Bye now
<Jmo> Lol'd
<Sumica> 00,10admision of guilt, case closed
<wipergone2> ga
<wipergone2> k
<Sylandest> yaaaaay
<twixie_sprinkle> aw already, i didnt even get to the part of telling him he basically confessed
<Polydunami> Right, let us move on
<Laurayne> I Have A Question!
<Tovler> I knew I recognized that name here before.
<AdamThePsyduck> Ohai Sumi
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi
<Sylandest> wassup, Laurayne?
<AJIsHaunter> Who's this incog fellow? I don't think I've seen him here before.
<Bigcheese> I'm still angry about derpy.
<Laurayne> Is Pinkie Pie Supposed To Be, Like, The Ponyville Equivilant Of Jesus? lol https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/17/RvrDToctFEWgjUnOwOga4A2.png
<Sylandest> Laurayne: she kinda is, aye
<Polydunami> All I know is that someone had PMed certain users telling them to change their username to incog.
<Polydunami> That's all I know
<Pinkies4thWall> !cd
<Tom> Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 3 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 49 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<AJIsHaunter> Bigcheese: Don't be. It's not reallly something to be angry about. We still have the episode where she's still the same lovable pony we know.
<AJIsHaunter> Polydunami: Ah, I see.
<Sumica> 00,10General network nussance and such
<Bigcheese> We also have 5 episodes of nothing :(
<Laurayne> She Can Teleport... Nuff Said
<Bigcheese> Oh look, someone finally fixed !cd
<Sumica> 00,10formyunderstanding he cant even view bronystate
<AJIsHaunter> Bigcheese: Well, we don't NEED Derpy to appear.
<Tovler> changing your name to incog got you banned at one point.
<Sumica> 00,10so he just lurks the chat between klines
<Polydunami> I'm probably not the first one to notice him.
<wipergone2> Sumica:who
<Jmo> Move on.
<Jmo> Discussion isn't worth going on about.
<Polydunami> I'm okay with that
<Sylandest> me too
<Jmo> Just a silly child who has too much time on their hands.
<twixie_sprinkle> why, seems interesting to me
<Sylandest> Who is ready for winter?
<twixie_sprinkle> especially if hes a troublemaker, seems like something to be aware of
<Sylandest> I am wanting some snow where I am
<Polydunami> We get snow. Some years.
<Laurayne> Pinkie Can Ever Scare Poor Woona D:
<Laurayne> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/17/RJhVJSc7XUmkFE5UsKiQ6g2.jpg
<NocturnalBlade> We rarely get some here in SC XD
<AJIsHaunter> I do have to agree, it's something I think I should know more about. But if it's not up for discussion at the moment, that's fine.
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter: did u liked the song?
<Sumica> 00,10Supposedly he's some one that messed with Furrnet and some other sites
<AJIsHaunter> Ah, I see.
<twixie_sprinkle> according to whom?
<Polydunami> You mean Asturias?
<twixie_sprinkle> Polydunami: well that too, altho i was asking him about the naruto one :P
<Sumica> 00,10he's been Klined on this network, and around mid summer his name was auto klined so he would PM people prenting to be an ircop and asking them to nickchange
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, should've remembered that
<wipergone2> Sumica: whts kline
<Sumica> 00,10banned from network
<AJIsHaunter> twixie_sprinkle: I did like the song. It was nice. :)
<twixie_sprinkle> k AJIsHaunter
<twixie_sprinkle> that japanese wind instruments creates some excellent atmosphere
<Sumica> 00,10as in cant use irc.ponychat.net at all
<twixie_sprinkle> *instrument
<Polydunami> Actually, I remember that part about PMing people.
<Sumica> 00,10generaly Klines get shared cross networks too so a kline can prevent you from using IRC all together
<wipergone2> Sumica: meaning ip is banned?
<Sumica> 00,10it's a bit more then that but yeah
<twixie_sprinkle> wipergone2: bigger than a single ip
<wipergone2> banned from whole irc?
<Polydunami> It's a possibility
<wipergone2> or only this irc
<Sumica> 00,10for sure this network,
<Sumica> 00,10other networks it depends
<wipergone2> Sumica: why is he klined
<Polydunami> Messing with websites
<wipergone2> from gnaa?
<twixie_sprinkle> he claims hes from gnaa
<wipergone2> i doubt tht
<Sumica> 00,10could be any number of reasons but that is above my pay grade.
<Chrysalis> sumi isnt a network wide ban a g-line not a k-line
<Polydunami> I didn't even know GNAA was a thing until One Bad Apple.
<wipergone2> Polydunami: me to
<AJIsHaunter> I forgot GNAA was a thing until Bad Apple.
<Laurayne> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/17/G29U38nPVUSNRAl3_LoKag2.gif
<Laurayne> Im Bored lol
<Sumica> 00,10farly sure it's a Kline cause that is what it says when they go poof
<Unnr> k lines tend to be for a specific server
<twixie_sprinkle> lol Laurayne
<Unnr> but not always
<Chrysalis> unnr thats what i thought
<wipergone2> who hates gnaa
<Polydunami> I can't believe I never got that incog was short for incognito until now. Me and my slow wit -_(\
<Unnr> but some ircds use the term kline instead of gline
<twixie_sprinkle> btw Polydunami thanks for naming those instruments, im liking their music
<wipergone2> btw who incog
<Polydunami> Glad I could be of help :)
<twixie_sprinkle> wipergone2: the guy who got banned
<wipergone2> wht happens if i put tht name in?
<Polydunami> Don't.
<twixie_sprinkle> wipergone2: you might be mistaken for him and banned too
<wipergone2> lol
<twixie_sprinkle> which will probably be a perma k-line
<Jmo> Put the name in.
<Jmo> Go on.
<Jmo> See what happens.
<Polydunami> Pfft
<twixie_sprinkle> but jaymoo, how do u do that? show us pls
<wipergone2> u think am tht supid?
*Sumica slaps Jmo with a brick
<Jmo> Ahahaha
<Sumica> 00,10dont encourage him
<WassonG> woah woah woah.
<WassonG> They've started adding disney films to netflix.
<Jmo> I'm so excited I can't express it.

<Malmortius> Man.. far cry 3 is amazing. Oh and hi guys.
<twixie_sprinkle> hoi Malmortius
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, Malmortius.

<AJIsHaunter> Hey cousin, let's go bowling!
<Jmo> No, I think you're the son of Einstein.
<twixie_sprinkle> anazer time perhaps, kazin
<WassonG> ...
<WassonG> it's just a matter of time before we get some of the syndicated cartoons, like Gargoyles and TAILSPIN!!
<NocturnalBlade> hi Malmortius
<Polydunami> I want to see Gargoyles. I've heard good things about it
<Polydunami> Mainly about the villain
<WassonG> oh, at first is's soooo good.
<WassonG> I used to love it when i was a kid.
<AJIsHaunter> I couldn't get into Gargoyles as a kid for some reason.
<WassonG> such good voice acting.
<Polydunami> I foresee a downside to this when you say, "at first".
<pony_1570> init half the cast of Gargoyles from Star Trek tng?
<AJIsHaunter> I knew the reason why people loved it, I just couldn't get into the show.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hi
<WassonG> It was a bit of a "transitional" cartoon i guess you could say.
<Polydunami> Hey there, aniderp
<AJIsHaunter> *reasons
<AJIsHaunter> Also, hi aniderp|bestcakeever.
<Polydunami> Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> did i miss shizy stream?
<AJIsHaunter> Yep, aniderp|bestcakeever.
<Polydunami> Oh dang
<aniderp|bestcakeever> all i saw was fire
<Polydunami> I missed Haruhi
<WassonG> I remember when I really liked it - I ended up moving later part of that year and we got sattelite and then I was hooked on DBZ on toonami hardcore lol.
<Polydunami> So did you guys get to see Endless Eight yet? >:3
<AJIsHaunter> No. ;D

*aniderp|bestcakeever sobs from being kicked in her back
<SkunkTauri> is anyone streaming? :)
<aniderp|bestcakeever> nope
<Polydunami> It would kind of give itself away if someone was streaming.
<Polydunami> This embed is very good about that
<SkunkTauri> i ment, is anyone going to start streaming soon?
<Polydunami> We're usually in the dark about that
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Refresh embed everyone :)

<AJIsHaunter> Polydunami: Wart isn't in this game, just to let you know. :D
<Polydunami> You mean I got my hopes up for nothing? Damn :S
<AJIsHaunter> As far as I remember. he only exists in Mario's dreams.
<Polydunami> Well, it's no big deal.
<Polydunami> What.

<AJIsHaunter> Kecleondarihu: I think he missed a few.
<Polydunami> Is there a special world like always?
<Kecleondarihu> AJIsHaunter, unless there are maps in this entire area that he hasn't touched, he's got all the coins.
<AJIsHaunter> One of the Star Road requirements was to get all of the coins in Peach's Castle.
<Polydunami> Star Road, huh?
<Polydunami> That's a thing in this game?
<AJIsHaunter> Kecleondarihu: Ah, I see.
<AJIsHaunter> Polydunami: I forgot what it's actually called, so I just call it that.
<AJIsHaunter> It's basically the Special WOrld of this game.
<xles> Heeellooo #bronystate!
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, xles. :)
<Polydunami> Hey there, xles
<Polydunami> Haven't seen you in a while

<Polydunami> Dammit, Bowser Jr.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 you will be licked
*JRP2234 licks SuperBrony64
<Polydunami> You should never have been.
<AJIsHaunter> May I ask what Botkiller weapons do?
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsHaunter, nothing different
<Polydunami> I'm more wondering what the are, to be honest :S
<Polydunami> *they
<AJIsHaunter> AdamTheDuck: Okay. Thanks. :)
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsHaunter, just looks and they are the same as "strange weapons"
<AJIsHaunter> AdamTheDuck: Ah, now I see.
<AJIsHaunter> Polydunami: I think they're weapons themed after Mann vs. Machine, if I recall.
<Polydunami> Still clueless :S
<Polydunami> So I looked it up, and it seems to be a TF2 thing
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 ima distraction
<Polydunami> That was hard.
<AJIsHaunter> Polydunami: Mann vs. Machine is a mode in TF2 in which you and 5 players are pitted against a tower defense mode. Some of the weapons you can get are botkiller weapons, themed after that bots in said mode.
<AJIsHaunter> For example, there's a sniper with a robo-Heavy's head tied to it.
<Polydunami> I really don't know much about the game.
<AJIsHaunter> *sniper rifle
<AJIsHaunter> Polydunami: That's fine.
<Polydunami> I would get into the game, but I'm afraid my keyboard does not support rollover.
<Polydunami> That is, can't push too many keys at once.
<JRP2234> bowser is fucking huge
<AJIsHaunter> I don't have the game, but I trying to do research so that I'll be ready and somewhat skilled at the game when I play it.
<AJIsHaunter> *Im
<Polydunami> Bowser is taking lessons from his son, Ludwig
<AJIsHaunter> *I'm
<AJIsHaunter> Ludwig's always been my favorite Koopaling.
<Polydunami> What.
<Polydunami> Now that is annoying.
<Polydunami> Either way, you get a fire flower?
<AJIsHaunter> If you manage t find and hit both blocks, yes.
<AJIsHaunter> *to
<Tovler> I liked how music notes would come out of Ludwig's spinning shell
<JRP2234> Phase4 y u no tf2
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, working on software
<JRP2234> what does it do? Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02technical things
<JRP2234> a bomb?
<Phase4> 00,02no
<Polydunami> This can't be the end
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ha he jumped to
<Polydunami> Seems awfully anti-climactic.
<Polydunami> climatic?
<Polydunami> Whatever
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 did you already beat it?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This is the best Mario game created.
<JRP2234> too short
<Tovler> Getting kissed on the hat
<AJIsHaunter> You think Peach'd let Mario take her out on a date or something, but nope. Kiss on the hat. :D
<Polydunami> I love these classic Koopalings much better.
<Polydunami> All we see is the kiss on the hat. No telling on what they do when we're not around.
<Tovler> poor phallic hill
<Polydunami> Or the nose
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 southpark time?
<Tovler> castle looks different from here.
<Polydunami> Is this the Superstar World?
<jcelios> nope
<Polydunami> Well. What do I know. :P
<jcelios> 2nd last world
<jcelios> 3rd if you include the secret one
<jcelios> physics cried
<Polydunami> Mario says, "Fuck off."
<Polydunami> To physics
<JRP2234> oi SuperBrony64 oyu watching the chat at all?
<jcelios> he's always like that :<
<Polydunami> He's kind of busy right now
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I can't talk and play a game at the same time :<
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 what other games you have
<Polydunami> I've seen him post his list before.
<Polydunami> It'll take up maybe two pages of chat
<SuperBrony64> 11,02For the Wii U? I have Skylanders Giants, Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Nintendo Land, and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed
<JRP2234> oi SuperBrony64 is there a achivement system on the wii u?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Only if the game includes it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But not system-wide
<JRP2234> dats stupid
<JRP2234> does black ops have it?
<AJIsHaunter> Well, you don't NEED achievements.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64?
<Polydunami> What secret level?
<AJIsHaunter> They're just fun to collect. They're not a requirement.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Polydunami> What next, are you going to ask me where Alex is?

<Polydunami> So. Will we ever see LOST on this stream?
<Polydunami> Just a random thought
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: No, unless you access the Wii Shop Channel in Wii Mode
<Polydunami> So what is this secret level business?
<JRP2234> show me wii mode]
<AJIsHaunter> There are secret exits in some stages that lead to secret areas/stages.
<Polydunami> Oh, so like in Super Mario World.
<AJIsHaunter> Yep. Pretty much. :)
<Tovler> like how there were 2 secret areas in the Valley of Bowser.
<Polydunami> Oho, that's the missing level
<Polydunami> Wait, do you mean the map where everything is dark?

<Polydunami> Damn you, auto-scrolling :|
<AJIsHaunter> I'm guessing that level's going to be similar to SMW in which the next level will be a back door for the final level?
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64?
<twixie_sprinkle> JRP2234: give him some time, hes busy atm
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: I don't want to as it's hard to do :/

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oi, what was that for?
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
*AssaultWithEmbraces slaps Meanwhile around a bit with a large trout
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oh wow, a Scout's skull and spine.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But how'e you, Meanwhile?
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: there's also a Spy's arm as a melee weapon
<Meanwhile> How'm I? Not bad. Bit bored, how're you?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Eh, I'm fine. Just found out yesterday that I can graduate this month but I can't walk till March because I failed a class and pushed me back. And the chair of my program forgot to tell the new director before he got in.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> So, I have no clue how to tell my parents :#
<Meanwhile> Postit note?
<Eli> defuq just happened?
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: :( nuuu
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Naah. They live like almost 3 hours from me. On top of that, my phone's not charging anymore so I think it might be something with the phone. The battery itself is totally fine.
<pony_26> text message
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: I know. :<
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Phase4> 00,02for those of you wondering, i'm reading http://svn.wikimedia.org/doc/
<Meanwhile> Write them a letter.
<DashWithRainbows> Oi, don't be startin', Joomay
<Jmo> You sound like a twat.
<Jmo> <:
<DashWithRainbows> Meh
<Jmo> Now I've heard you I can sleep at night.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Eheheheh, yes they're TOTALLY gonna take it much better through a letter. :S
<DashWithRainbows> You have yet to see me, Joomay.
*AssaultWithEmbraces wishes she could go back in time a couple of quarters
<Jmo> You have a point.
<Jmo> I can imagine what you look like though.
<Phase4> 00,022 is death
<DashWithRainbows> Go on then
<Phase4> 00,02lets see which he goes through
<Jmo> ROFL
<DashWithRainbows> Describe me, Joomay.
<Phase4> 00,02seems soldier solved that
<Jmo> You'd want that, wouldn't you.
<Eli> Havok: what are you doing???
<DashWithRainbows> Yes, I would.
<Jmo> Dunno, I imagine you're tallish, skinny, pale skinned, scruffy face.
<Havok> :3
<Meanwhile> Nah, he's short fat tanned and is clean shaven.
<Meanwhile> Don't you know anything?
<Jmo> Like you'd know
<Meanwhile> Know better than you Koalabreath.
<Gold_Demona> You're both wrong. Everyone knows that he's a pony.
<Eli> Phase4: not again...
*Meanwhile slaps Gold_Demona around a bit with a large trout
<Phase4> 00,02Eli, its 1:41
<Phase4> 00,02thats my excuse
<Eli> Phase4: good excuse... it's 3:41 pm here... but i'm probably just as tired

<Jmo> Oh yeah, you never commented on my description Ash.
<DashWithRainbows> Oh yeah.
<DashWithRainbows> Hmm, I'm not very tall, 'bout average hieght, I am skinny, quite pale skinned, no scruffy face.
<DashWithRainbows> Not bad Joomay.
<DashWithRainbows> Not bad at all.
<Jmo> Damn.
<Phase4> 00,02my method of repetedly jumping seems to be failing
<Phase4> 00,02cant imagine why
<Meanwhile> Man Phase she knocked you over the building.
<Meanwhile> I mean you frickin sailed.
<DashWithRainbows> Phase, when you do that and get low on health, just run around with the escape plan
<DashWithRainbows> That's what I do :P
<Phase4> 00,02DashWithRainbows, thats what i also do but tired == cbf running away
<djblazekin> how do you add mlp charecters to tf2
<DashWithRainbows> I just rocket jump like mad now :P
<DashWithRainbows> Not my favourite map.
<DashWithRainbows> djblazekin This server has them as the Hale, you download them for this server to see them
<DashWithRainbows> There are Pony skins for classes such as Scout, Sniper, Pyro and Demo right now.
<DashWithRainbows> The rest are still in development I think.
<Jmo> tl;dr
<DashWithRainbows> tl;dr = Shuddup Joomay.
<Jmo> Wanna go chavo?
<DashWithRainbows> Nah
<DashWithRainbows> Playin' TF2
<Jmo> Fine.
<DashWithRainbows> Too busy for you.
<Jmo> So am I but I'm not busy.
<Jmo> So what's your excuse?
<djblazekin> do i need any other addons to make this mod work
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Phase4> 00,02djblazekin, nope
<Phase4> 00,02server ip: 208.167.245.210
<djblazekin> awsome now if only i knew how to mod black ops zombies maps for a ponyville map
<Wrek> 05implying blackops allows mapmaking
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02i didnt think any of the cod's did
<Meanwhile> Implying blackops is worth using in any capacity besides firewood.
<Phase4> 00,02^^^
<Phase4> 00,02even then, its plastic
<Phase4> 00,02poor matrial for burning
<Meanwhile> Frisbee then.
<Phase4> 00,02maybe
<Phase4> 00,02cd's are not the most stable frisbee's though
<Havok> lol Dash
<Wrek> 05as shuriken
<djblazekin> it's not an official thing but i've seen people play zombies with modded maps
<Wrek> 05so its nothing for exbawx or peeeesthree
<djblazekin> no it's pc and mac only
<Wrek> 05in other words
<Wrek> 05HAHAHA consoles
<Meanwhile> Sounds about right.
<HoodEvee|Skool> Hai beestate
*NewDCD likes both PC gaming and console gaming
<NewDCD> 09,01but above all portable gaming
<NewDCD> 09,01get on my level : 3c
<djblazekin> same with the orangebox on consoles besides fpss are ment to be played with mouse and keyboard
<Meanwhile> Your level is casual.
*sub06905 dances
<Meanwhile> Besides, those tiny screens give me eyeache.
*NewDCD BOULDER PUNCHES Meanwhile
<NewDCD> 09,01for some reason I've found that last gen and this one, better games are getting released on portables
<NewDCD> 09,01take Resident Evil Revelations for example. It's actually a survival horror game unlike the last few console outings of the series, and might be the best RE of the last few years
<NewDCD> 09,01I think it might be a better horror game than 4
<NewDCD> 09,01so yeah
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Is that Pinkie in latex stocking??
<Havok> Yes AssaultWithEmbraces
<Havok> It is
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Well.
<DashWithRainbows> It's Kinkie Pie, AssaultWithEmbraces.
<sub06905> :D
<HoodEvee|Skool> :]
<AssaultWithEmbraces> DashWithRainbows, that was my first thought when I looked closer at the stockings.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> This cereal needs either sugar or raisins
<HoodEvee|Skool> Both
<HoodEvee|Skool> Use both
<Meanwhile> Raisins are evil.
<HoodEvee|Skool> Or some lucky charms mallows
<djblazekin> yeah except mgs snake eater for 3ds the controls are wonky and you'd get better sound and visuals on the psvita version
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Raisins are delicious.
<Meanwhile> They're grapes that have been possessed by mephistopheles.
<Meanwhile> Eating a raisin is karmatically the same as stabbing an orphan.
<Jmo> So you eat raisin every morning.
<HoodEvee|Skool> So, I can stab orphans without feeling guilty?
<HoodEvee|Skool> Sweet
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Mephistopheles?
<Wrek> 05ok it happened again Phase4
<Wrek> 05halp
<Wrek> 05u busy rite nao?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Marshmallows are delicious, especially in hot chocolate on a cold winter night.
<djblazekin> if only i could play as twilight sparkle in portal
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, i got some time betwene rounds
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, irc or skype?
<Wrek> 05skype
<HoodEvee|Skool> :I

<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Phase4 :3
<Havok> anomeD_dloG
<Havok> Hai
<djblazekin> Best breakfast ever cheeseburgers with macaroni with bacon it
<HoodEvee|Skool> 'MURICA
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I had steak and eggs for breakfast once
<AssaultWithEmbraces> My family makes fun of me for it whateverr chance they get
<Gold_Demona> Why? Steak and eggs is good. D:
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I was living with my parents at the time
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I ate it for breakfast before school that day
<HoodEvee|Skool> I had sushi for breakfast once ._.
<HoodEvee|Skool> It wasn't cooked right
<djblazekin> Where are you going to be doing when the world ends
<Havok> Isn't badly cooked sushi dangerous?
<HoodEvee|Skool> Laughing at the people in nuclear shelters
<HoodEvee|Skool> Havok: It's sickening
<Havok> Oh
<Sylandest> doing secret stuff...lol
<pony_26> clopping
<Havok> ^
<AssaultWithEmbraces> No
<djblazekin> when i come out of the nuke shelter zombies might be walking around so i have my kitana
<HoodEvee|Skool> ._.
<HoodEvee|Skool> Zombies come first
<HoodEvee|Skool> Then nukes
<HoodEvee|Skool> Too much radiation shouldn't mutate, its a straight up death
<HoodEvee|Skool> Deranged cannibals might be a problem
<djblazekin> thats close enough to zombies
<Gold_Demona> More secret stuff :>
<Sylandest> secretive phase is secret
<HoodEvee|Skool> Zombies are walking, flesh eating corpses. Zombies have to die first

<Phase4> 00,02well i waited patiently through many rounds of tf2 just to get friendlys
<Barlubetoes> Oh shit. Phase4 is going to Phase5.
<Phase4> 00,02its not fun when theres only ONE server on THE ENTIRE PLANET with that game mode and a mod comes in and ruins it
<wipergone2> Phase4: wht game mode
<Phase4> 00,02then i broke the computer in the shed and had to go out and fix it manually
<Phase4> 00,02but i coudlnt cause its keyboard is broken
<Phase4> 00,02so i had to reboot and prey it worked
<Phase4> 00,02then it started raining when i had to come inside
<Phase4> 00,02now i cant make the software work cause the person who designed it was a complete idiot
<Phase4> 00,02and i'm not happy :(
<Barlubetoes> We need ponies! Stat!
<wipergone2> Phase4: whts up

<wipergone2> Wrek: whts up with Phase4

<vidmaster> who's vidmaster4694? Cuz that's supposed to be my nickname for here
<Phase4> 00,02Havok, ufw, bunch of scripts ontop of iptables to impliment firewalls
<Havok> oh
<Wrek> 05wipergone2: whts up wth ur typin
<Phase4> 00,02whoever designed this decided that rules should be deleted by either a symbolic name or their numeric index
<wipergone2> Wrek: why should i tell
<Phase4> 00,02if it doesnt have a symbolic name, it prints the port number, not the index
<Phase4> 00,02so you have no idea what rule is what until you delete it
<Phase4> 00,02one of those rules controlls the connection i'm using to edit the rules
<wipergone2> Phase4: whts the matter
<Phase4> 00,02wipergone2, lots of little things

<wipergone2> :O
<Sumica> 00,10it's plenty cold enough to do so
<MadSurge> Just not in the vicinity
<xles> I like snow - when it's not this hot outside... Barely freezing. +/-0C
<xles> This is just wet and tedious.
<Sumica> 00,10the mesa gets some as well as the foothills due to the mountain shadow effect but never more then a foot or so.
<Sumica> 00,10AJ looks pissed in that shot
<Everlasting_Joy> We're stuck in a nice little drought, so snow has been virtually non-existant here.
<Everlasting_Joy> And what we get melts or gets blown away, so :(.

<Everlasting_Joy> Sylandest: No no no, you have to turn the stove knob to 8.
<Sylandest> He also tried to do it to my fridge
<Sylandest> but I objected
<Sylandest> piss flavored water is not one of my preferences.
<Sumica> 00,10i hope you objected with a blunt object to his head
<Invi> Sylandest, you should advice him to wear diapers when getting drunk
<Sylandest> Sumica: I objected by turning him around and giving a swift kick to his rear into the bathroom
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Sylandest> Incendia: Its a good idea, neh, hehe

<alexxm> sup Dark92Enigma
<MadSurge> That only makes me more confused
<Dark92Enigma> hi alexxm! I've heard CM Punk is injured :(
<Emily_Y> Have you guys seen Game of Thrones done with ponies?
<Emily_Y> it's amazing
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma yeah i heard he isn't cleared to wrestle at TLC
<VenHur> CM Punk...?
<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: The Straightedge wrestler
<Dark92Enigma> Straightedge: no alcohol, no smoking, no drugs
<Sumica> 00,10sounds boreing
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Dark92Enigma :)
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica: it's ok, that's their lifestyle :D
<Dark92Enigma> hi MLP_Brovakiin!
<Trrrixy> When is there gonna be more pony?
<MadSurge> Sumica: I am straight edge, but I am not boring! Or at least I think :D
<ekips> Trrrixy ..you did not ask that
<Sumica> 00,10No I ment as being his wresseling gimic
<ekips> you don't want to ask that Trrrixy
<Sumica> 00,10Ponies you say?
<MadSurge> Sumica: well then yeah
<Trrrixy> Why is it a bannable offense?
<ekips> Sumica: ewww. ponies
<MadSurge> Trrrixy: no, but you'll get anything but FiM
<Trrrixy> ;_;
<pony_6498> ponies are not allowed here. what do you think this is, bronystate?
<Trrrixy> Lol
<Trrrixy> You messing wiff me :D
<ekips> request ponies and you'll end up watching the World's Biggest Tea Party
<Trrrixy> Okay
<MadSurge> ^
<VenHur> USTREAM is one of the bestest ways to stream anything, and plus, if you had AdBlock, it's even better without the ads.
<Trrrixy> Requesting anti-pony vids!
<Buytoast> horses are forbidden here
<Shammy> wut?
<Sumica> 00,10flashbacks
<Shammy> ah..
<pony_6498> AHHHHHHHHHH
<MadSurge> I knew it! THE PARALITIC GIRL IS THE MASTERMIND
<pony_6498> thats what she had to do with it
<ekips> Did I miss an important part of the plot?
<MadSurge> Well then, that clears any problem! They're artificial, so they can be killed without regret~
<Sumica> 00,10seems legit
<Dark92Enigma> BRB lunch time
<Trrrixy> Dat Plot
<pony_6498> wut
<pony_6498> was that about?
<MadSurge> Then why are they trying to fill the book anyway?
<Sumica> 00,10Because the book is slowly killing her
<MadSurge> Are you sure it's not her previous illness?
<MadSurge> That's one ugly bunny
<Sumica> 00,10Badguys, not so bad
<Sumica> 00,10but then.......
<MadSurge> Where did one-dimensional villains go? :'(
<VenHur> Speaking of one-dimensional chracters, whatever happens to Donkey Kong Jr? :(
<MadSurge> VenHur: he became the actual Donkey Kong
<MadSurge> The original Donkey Kong is actually Cranky Kong :D
<VenHur> Well, it's true, the Donkey Kong from the arcade game becames Cranky Kong, while Donkey Kong Jr (though, not offictially known from Rare) might turned out to be the Donkey Kong we know since the Country games and onwards.
<MadSurge> Shut constructs, go back in the book! :|
<MadSurge> VenHur: my headcanon :D
<pony_6498> the plot thickens...
<Sumica> 00,10facefall
<VenHur> So there, I could be right 50/50.
<MadSurge> Where the hell did she end up
<Emily_Y> Damn these Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare ads!
<Emily_Y> lol
<Sumica> 00,10she's off on other dimentions trying to fill the book so she wont have to hurt people
<Sumica> 00,10Emily_Y, adblock+
<VenHur> Though, Donkey Kong Jr and Donkey Kong are both in Mario Tennis (The N64 one, not the Virtual Boy one), but it's a spinoff, so we'll leave that to be.
<MadSurge> So let me get this straight: giant monsters are weak, but ten years old are strong?
<Emily_Y> I run safari :(
<Sumica> 00,10sorry to hear that
<VenHur> Screw the logic, They're freaking nekos!
<pony_6498> what is it with animes and putting cat ears and tails on characters?
<VenHur> They're Nekos...
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Magic Duel Comics: Twilight's Training Montage / Support / Magic Duel / Disapproval

<Serenity> Sumica: Not finished with them, had no time to put em away
<Lunac> Sumica, why torture your fellow bronies?
<pony_6498> i wonder if the creators of generation 3 even cared about characterization in the show
<Gold_Demona> Friieeeeeeeeends... no wait
<MadSurge> Because we need to be strong against trolling Lunac :D
<MadSurge> NO!
<Lunac> No trolling either
<MadSurge> GOAL!!!
<Lunac> Want to troll me Red vs blue marathon
<MadSurge> :D
<Serenity> Yessss

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye Lunac
<Lunac> hopefullyno anime then
<MadSurge> Dammit Sumica, settle on one anime! :D
<Serenity> I think my school teacher is trying to become a troll. Earlier today, she peered at me, pulled a grin and said "Problem?"
<Sumica> 00,10oh little dose he know that DCD has plans for later
<Gold_Demona> lol
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Sumica: DUWANG plans?
*Ryunosuke glomps the room
<Sumica> 00,10probably
*AssaultWithEmbraces glomps Ryunosuke
<MadSurge> Why are all these mons' basic forms an amourphous blob? O_o
<VenHur> Japanese Openings > English Openings
<Ryunosuke> how is everyone
<Ryunosuke> venhur I concur
<pony_6498> anybody here played with the digimon tamagachi things?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge, well they're babies at that point.
<VenHur> I'm fine, Ryunosuke.
<Meanwhile> Oh hey, Digimon time.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Right on time, Meanwhile.
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: so you say they're embryos? 'cause that would make sense
<Gold_Demona> Ooh, THIS episode
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oooh SkullGreymon episode!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Woo
<Meanwhile> Oh this episode is boss, perfect.
<Dark_Horst> damn. missed stuff
<Dark_Horst> evening
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: I guess so. Sinc
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Egg>Basic blob form>first form>Digivolved>Ultimate?
<Chrysalis> 'sup
<Serenity> I've noticed they never blink
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I think that's how the order goes, unless I forgot something?
<Tervicz> ...In the desert you can't remember your name... ^^
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> huh, no stream
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oh Etamon, you egotistical monkey mofo
<Sylandest> ahh, this episode...
<Chrysalis> wait what there is a stream?
<Chrysalis> curse you internet
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Yes.
<Sylandest> Chrysalis: refresh?
<Chrysalis> i hate my ISP
<Chrysalis> brb guys
<Gold_Demona> The order is Egg > Baby > In Training (husband calls it "onion form") > Rookie (what we're seeing now) > Champion > Ultimate > Mega Ultimate (the names are different in Japanese, but that's how I remember them)
<Sylandest> LIES!
<Sylandest> HE WOULD
<AssaultWithEmbraces> YOU LIAR
<pony_6498> id never try something like that! >.> hahahah
<Wynn> Wazzup?!?!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> "I'd never try something like that!" Oh really, then explain how the fuck SkullGreymon happened.
<pony_6498> lol
<Dark_Horst> AssaultWithEmbraces: it did already?
<Emily_Y> I hate how they ruined this show with the later seasons
<pony_6498> high tech radar system.... that relies on trip wires XD
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dark_Horst, it's going to. The episode started like 4, 5 minutes ago.
<Meanwhile> Personally Etemon sounded better when he was an Elvis impersonator.
<Dark_Horst> ah
<Gold_Demona> I agree Meanwhile
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, i remember that colloseum
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't remember Etamon's Elvis voice a lot.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah one of the few localisations I liked
<Gold_Demona> dat dub
<Sumica> 00,10there now you heard it
<Meanwhile> Thanks Sumi.
<Dark_Horst> his iq sounded lower there
<Emily_Y> the subtitles are horrible.....
<AssaultWithEmbraces> He sounds like Johnny Bravo, lel
<Dark_Horst> it's not the subtitles, it's the egnlish dub
<Gold_Demona> AssaultWithEmbraces: Well, Johnny Bravo was also supposed to sound like Elvis, so that makes sense. :D
<Dark_Horst> itlikes to not give a damn about actually translating
<pony_6498> does this song only play in the japanese version?
<Gold_Demona> Yup
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Gold_Demona, they make everyone want to sound like Elvis.
<pony_6498> >.> wut? why?
<Gold_Demona> American version made up its own soundtrack
<pony_6498> they think american kids arnt refined enouph or somethign?
<Dark_Horst> the english dub also threw all the soundtracks out the window and implemnted its one single track
<Dark_Horst> EVERYWHERE!
<Emily_Y> Nothing spoken in English is ever bad... Ever... So clearly the subtitles are off...
<AssaultWithEmbraces> How convienent. Mention the good ol days at soccer camp and travel to a soccer field in the middle of the desert
<Sylandest> random soccer ball
<Sylandest> completely safe
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I wanna know WHERE the electricity to power the screen comes from.
<Sumica> 00,10Emily_Y, can I use you to sheild my self from radiation?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> In the desert.
<Dark_Horst> AssaultWithEmbraces: MAGIC!
<Emily_Y> You can
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dark_Horst, bullshit :3
<pony_6498> YOU BLEW IT!
<Emily_Y> You may not however
<Sumica> 00,10Clearly it's solar powered
<Dark_Horst> seriously though, the whole world is digital. things tend to not make sense
<Tervicz> It's a trap!
<Dark_Horst> loltrap
<Emily_Y> AGUMON YOU DOLT
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Like how electonic devices act wonky around Hogwarts
<Snow> ackbar was too late
<Chrysalis> Ahh badgreymon ep
<Snow> oh wait i know this one
<AssaultWithEmbraces> That looks like a costume he has on
<Dark_Horst> probably is one
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Look at his upper arm, looks like he tried to fix it but failed
<Snow> best timing of dancing ever
<Dark_Horst> like that little guy with the pelt
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dance Sumica~
<Jmo> Ohai Snow
<Emily_Y> Dude, that's gotta hurt!
<Sumica> 00,10sudden music end
<Dark_Horst> that'S a lot of volts
<pony_6498> you know you suck when the theme song stops playing
<Dark_Horst> curbstomp! curbstomp! curbstomp!
<Sumica> 00,10dose this bug you? dose this bug you? dose this bug you? dose this bug you? dose this bug you?
<Meanwhile> Curb stomped.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Shut up, Tai~
<Dark_Horst> isaac clarke would be proud
<Gold_Demona> lol XD
<Snow> burp
<pony_3045> it's pikachu!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dammit Tai, you be like Naruto and believe it!
<Snow> AssaultWithEmbraces: i hope not, believe it!
<MadSurge> Wait, monkey Elvis? WTH?! JAPAAAAAAAAAAAN
<Dark_Horst> few do know that before his colloseum career, that greaymon was known as "the mexican menace" in the ring
<Meanwhile> There's a dimenionsal rift over there.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Snow: Oh god I suddenly shuddered and cringed at the english dub of "Believe it!" Soooo horrrible.
<Meanwhile> How convenient.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You got your crest, good job. Now let's GTFO before we all die.
<Buytoast> uh oh
<Buytoast> is it time
<Sylandest> inb4 Taichi messes up
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Tai what are you doing
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Tai, staaahp
<Snow> tai
<Snow> stahp
<VenHur> Tai! STOP DJU FUUL!
<MadSurge> Please tell me the monkey dies in the next ten minutes
<Buytoast> you wish
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge, I doubt it. I think the monkey is a Dark Master so it's not likely.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Etemon's several episodes away from dying. :P
<pony_6498> should change it to english dub evertime the monkey talks
<MadSurge> A what?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: He's the final boss of this season
<Buytoast> he aint no dark master
<Meanwhile> Nah, there are only four Dark Masters and they all showed up at once.
<MadSurge> GODDAMMIT
<Sylandest> uh-oh...
<Buytoast> those guys aint until much later
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NO TAI
<Buytoast> oh yes
<Buytoast> it's time
<MadSurge> First Fail Anima, now an annoying monkey
<AssaultWithEmbraces> TAICHI KAMIYA, YOU IDIOT
<Buytoast> the end has come
<Snow> OH SHIT
<Meanwhile> Dat expression.
<Snow> that thing again
<VenHur> AW SHIT!
<Sylandest> He sounds a lot scarier than his dubbed version
<MadSurge> YAY!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Congratulations, Tai. You just unleased a Dark Digivolve. Fucking idiot.
<Sylandest> lol, he tried to run
<pony_6498> fish rocket?
<Snow> ded
<Buytoast> damn
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: After the monkey, we get a wannabe Count Dracula. :P
<Meanwhile> Well.
<SafariMonkey> I keep getting pings. :P
<Emily_Y> SHARKPEDO
<Emily_Y> LOL
<alexxm> he fucked up
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: why can't this series have serious villains?
<Kencolt> The trope for this ism I believe, "Good Job Breaking it, Hero".
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Because it's not a serious series? :P
<Emily_Y> launch the torpedo, I mean SHARKPEDO
<Meanwhile> Because serious villains aren't as amusing?
<Snow> MadSurge: what fun is there in serious villains?
<Buytoast> the dark masters are serios buisiness you know
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Let this be a lesson, kids: Don't force a Digivolve. Nasty shit will occurr.
<Gold_Demona> What fun is there in being serious?
<MadSurge> Snow: actual menace?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Serious villains were serious when we were all kids. :D
<Snow> MadSurge: example of a not serious villain
<Wrek> 05best villains are the ones that where the villain could jsut as well be the good guy
<Snow> Discord.
<Wrek> 05and vice versa for the good guy
<VenHur> Sudden Wrek.
<Sumica> 00,10that was nanoha a bit ago wrek
<Meanwhile> Also, Electro Shocker sounds way cooler than Mega Blaster.
<Gold_Demona> onion form :>
<Buytoast> you're a failure koromon
<AssaultWithEmbraces> If the Digital World had laws, Tai would be in prison for Digmon/animal abuse
<MadSurge> Sitting down is not stopping?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> THINK ABOUT IT
<Buytoast> you've let your master down
<Buytoast> how can you call yourself a digimon now
<MadSurge> Now kick the ball!
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Sumica> 00,10kick the baby!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Don't kick the baby!
<Buytoast> proably get some good air
<pony_6498> kick the baby. *punt*
<Sumica> 00,10nah he's all lumpy and shit
<Sumica> 00,10would waste too much energy
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Try the egg
<Snow> kick the baby reminds me of a german commercial
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But seriously guys. If the Digital World had laws, Tai would be in jail for that stunt he just pulled
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup
<Gold_Demona> But it doesn't, so he's forgiven. XD
<Sumica> 00,10if it had laws they would probably have bigger fish to deal with
<Sumica> 00,10you know such as the destroying the world evil
<Buytoast> if they had laws monkey man would probably be getting the shower shuffle right about now
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: for making a wimpy dinosaur a badass skeleton? That would warrant a medal!
<pony_7591> what is this
<Buytoast> terrorism and attempted murder and all
<Meanwhile> If they had laws the digidestined would be in prison for slavery
<Snow> its not slavery if the digimons are ok with it.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: The badass skeleton was a result of forcing a digimon to Digivolve when they damn well knew that they couldn't.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hell, Agumon could testify in court against Tai and so could the others.
<Sumica> 00,10it's a good thing they are never in a situation like that again in the show >_>
<alexxm> but wheres the fun in that
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: then why he managed to do it?
<Sumica> 00,10you know the we need to digivolve but cant
<Bronysith> this song
<Meanwhile> I like how Devimon is all hyped up but he's less powerful than a monkey who acts like Elvis.
<pony_7591> could digimon be feeling pain as they transform
<Bronysith> it is awesome
<VenHur> Sumica: *cough* Season 2... *cough*
<Buytoast> well, Elvis IS the king
<Meanwhile> Fair point.
<Buytoast> and wasn't devimon only a champion level or something?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: He finally caved in but as a result of Tai force feeding him it didn't really lead to the best results.
<ACS13123> Wait, love is a plane now?
<ACS13123> And hi
<Meanwhile> Yeah but that's my point. He's DEVIMON, but he's really not that big of a deal.
<Meanwhile> In fact all things considered in the evil digimon lineup he's pretty shite.
<Sumica> 00,10but he's totaly evil, he had a whole army
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: so it's a BBD, Berserk Badass Dinosaur :D
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Sumica> 00,10armys make you evil
<Buytoast> and he made gears
<Buytoast> GEARS
<Buytoast> OF WAR
<Meanwhile> MARIAAAAAAA
<Buytoast> AND EVIL
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: That's like someone MAKING you eat when you're sick and you know yourself that you don't feel like it. The end result: possibly getting sicker and/or puking
<Snow> im just saying, digimon is darwins evelution theory, only cooler
<Snow> evolution*
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Meanwhile: But what about Diaboromon and Kokomon?
<Meanwhile> Tai quit being a downer.
<Meanwhile> I don't remember either of them so I have no idea.
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: but I love being fe-actually that's a good point. I still don't get this series.
<Sumica> 00,10she's lost it
<Meanwhile> Troll cactus.
<MadSurge> That's one big cactus
<Sumica> 00,10Jennai you ass
<Sumica> 00,10oh sorry Genni
<Meanwhile> Pfft, now you're worried about spelling?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Meanwhile: Diaboromon was the virus thing in the first part of the digimon movie that was messing with the phone lines. Kokomon was Willis' creation and backfired somehow
<Meanwhile> Whatever they were they didn't have shit on Apocalymon.
<Sumica> 00,10you would have corrected me had I not Meanwhile
<MadSurge> You mean this guy isn't secretely the villain?
<Meanwhile> I didn't correct your "armies"
<Buytoast> just punch the old man and take over the continent
<Dark_Horst> btw, it'S Gennai
<Buytoast> you can do it
<Dark_Horst> B)
<GabeMoist> GASP
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Can't punch the old man if it's a hologram, Buytoast
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Ship.
<Buytoast> then find the real old man
<VenHur> IT'S THE TITANIC'S GHOOOOOOST!!
<Buytoast> abd socket to him
<Sumica> 00,10sand steamer
<MadSurge> Boat in the desert, makes total sense
<Gold_Demona> AssaultWithEmbraces: No, Diaboromon was Willis' creation. It infected Kokomon and that's why he went crazy.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: Digital World
<Meanwhile> Dat look.
<Snow> O.O
<Sylandest> and suddenly, seduced
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Gold_Demona: Ohhh. I knew Diaboromon was made by Willis and had something to do with Kokomon somehow.
<Meanwhile> Empowering.
<Snow> Gotta remember that one.
<MadSurge> Ewww preteen slut
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oh god, Mimi. Stop whoring yourself
<ekips> tease level increased to 5!
<Buytoast> oh my
<Snow> ALL THE CLOTHES
<MadSurge> Inb4 it's a trap
<Sumica> 00,10looks like a yard sale
<pony_26> o my
<Dark_Horst> you know, she's kind of like rarity
<Dark_Horst> only less refined
<alexxm> how many times have they been fooled by the villians luxery location now
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And not as prissy?
<Snow> Dark_Horst: i see what you did there.
<GilDash> Yeah, the first thing I would do upon getting on a ship in the middle of the desert is not strip. XD
<Sylandest> I like how they're eating by waving their hands
<Snow> anime logic
*AssaultWithEmbraces sighs "Boys."
<Snow> deal with it
<GilDash> Sylandest: You mean you don't do that?
<Sumica> 00,10Kip Pithon
<Dark_Horst> lol
<Meanwhile> Surprise, he's actually a huge ugly bird.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> BIRDY.
<VenHur> Human into a giant chicken...
<VenHur> WHAT DAFUQ, JAPAN?!
<Sumica> 00,10wired ship
<Sumica> 00,10makes sence
<AssaultWithEmbraces> VenHur: Japan. That is all.
<MadSurge> It's the chicken from mars!
*thelonepony pokes Snow :3
*Snow is poked D:
<Gold_Demona> It's Chicken Boo
<Serenity> My cat is such a spac
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: you telling me your luxury cruise ship runs on batteries? you crazy?
<Gold_Demona> Dah!!!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> OH MY GOD
<Dark_Horst> correction. he crazy
<MadSurge> SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
<AssaultWithEmbraces> WHAT EVEN.
<VenHur> AssaultWithEmbraces: Damn it, now I wants to lives in Japan for some reason.
<GilDash> That an interesting way of censoring.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Etamon is clearly compensating for something besides a crappy costume.
<Dark_Horst> i was just aboutn to say something about his critch teddy
<Dark_Horst> *crotch
<MadSurge> See. Trap
<Dark_Horst> fish in the swimming pool
<Dark_Horst> bam
<Dark_Horst> explain that
<thelonepony> Holla Dark92Enigma :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Dark92Enigma
<Meanwhile> He pulled fish randomly out of a statue last episode, don't question the reality warping power of Marching Fishes.
<Dark92Enigma> hola thelonepony!
<Sumica> 00,10wake and bake
<Snow> the stare
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: fish? In water? PREPOSTEROUS
*Dark92Enigma abraza a thelonepony
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Meanwhile: Next time the fish'll come out from someplace.
<MadSurge> OH COME ON
<Dark92Enigma> The_Browncoat: como te fue en tu examen?
<Dark_Horst> yep. chicken
<AssaultWithEmbraces> kekekekeke
<Gold_Demona> Dark_Horst: Gomamon's attack makes fish appear out of nowhere. :P
<AssaultWithEmbraces> That's not how you call for a chicken
<MadSurge> Chicken is OTP. Nerf plz
<Meanwhile> It is however how you call for a Chickenmon.
<Dark_Horst> Gold_Demona: i know, but does science?
<GilDash> Always with the naming of the attacks.
<Gold_Demona> Dark_Horst: Science? In the digital world? Puh-leeez~ XP
<Sylandest> and cue the moment
<MadSurge> Here's an idea: DON'T LOOK AT HIM
<Dark92Enigma> The_Browncoat: sorry, tab fail, i was talking to thelonepony
<AssaultWithEmbraces> It's like Yu-Gi-Oh and constantly yelling yourself hoarse to name a card
