<Tovler> Transformers 3 is the best Rifftrax
<otakon17> Lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> is it me or is steam just getting lazy?
<Sergio_Scriptor> CrimsonPhoenix: it's steam :\
<otakon17> The previous 2 hours was prologue
<MadSurge> Hello LadyCanary|wubwub, care to share some of your happiness?
<Shizuka> 13PREPAH TO BROADSIDE
<Rex_Mundi> *Attaking walls with pikement*
<CrimsonPhoenix> I mean this Greenlight thingy
<Rex_Mundi> *pikemen
<Sergio_Scriptor> CrimsonPhoenix: it's cool but...meh :\
<Vordox> Shizuka: Can't wait till the torch scene
<Vivix> Greenlight might be good for getting small indie and singleperson projects on, like Desura
<otakon17> CrimsonPhoenix: How? Its giving people a chance to pick which games to add
<StuffJustHappened> CrimsonPhoenix: It's a nice idea but kind of wrong executed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm skeptical in this whole thing
<LadyCanary|wubwub> MadSurge: ^_____^ Sque
<Vivix> I'm nonchalant so far
<Vivix> they review everything that is voted up
<Vordox> Dat scream
<Sergio_Scriptor> maybe now with this greenlight thing we might get Postal 3 on steam :) or Even "Abe's oddysee: HD remake" :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> so tonight is Over the Hedge?
<Vivix> if it fails their inspection- it won't get up anywa
<otakon17> I have a couple of things
<Ryunosuke> that wilhelm
<Fl00tersh41> Poor wilhelm. He died a hero
<otakon17> SeaponiesofLiverpool: And D Wars
<Sergio_Scriptor> SeaponiesofLiverpool: yeah :P
<alfopony> vordox: beat me to it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> i JUST got the newsletter
<otakon17> 7 gonads
<alexxm> kill count compition
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> and submited it
<otakon17> Lol
*Tovler is proud to admit he saw Over the Hedge in theatres by himself.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> A: Guardians of G'hoole
<otakon17> Vigo fighting orcs naked
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> B: The Postman
<Ryunosuke> that plot
<Tommy> These kill counts are unfair, Legolas has ranged damage; there's no way Gimli can keep up in a siege
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Pony episode: Cherry Bomb
<Klumzeedragon> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Yep. And Dragon Wars. *shudders*
<Sergio_Scriptor> Tovler: i saw it on my tv :P
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Dragon Wars Rifftrax?
<otakon17> Tommy: He'll run out of arrows eventually
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> please let it be that one
<otakon17> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Sadly no
<Tovler> I can't remember a damn thing about Over the Hedge
<CrimsonPhoenix> I think I see doubles
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Nooooooooooooo
<MadSurge> LadyCanary|wubwub: 'tis not a happy day for me
<Sergio_Scriptor> SeaponiesofLiverpool: just the movie :P
<Tommy> otakon17 yeah but that's a huge advantegde at the start of the fight anyway
<CrimsonPhoenix> Some games appears multiple times
<Klumzeedragon> Tovler: Hammy!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> D-war wasn't an awful movie
<otakon17> Tommy: True
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I liked the special effects
<LadyCanary|wubwub> D: Why MadSurge
*Tovler shudders thinking about D-War
<Klumzeedragon> SeaponiesofLiverpool: More like... Special... uh... Defects. 6_9
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> NO! I forgot a good b movie
<Vivix> Aaagh Cat is pushing all my desk decoration away
<Tommy> suddenly, a fight!
<Sergio_Scriptor> D-war might be good...or is it a terrible movie ? :(
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> or A movie?
<otakon17> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Dead Alive
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Flight of Dragons
<otakon17> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Ghostbusters
<Sergio_Scriptor> i wish we could see Flash gordon again today :'(
<Tovler> can't we pick good indie movies you've never heard of?
<DJ_POn-3_> Vivix: :( MY CAT DOES THAT TO
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> you guys probably don't remember Flight of Dragons
<Rex_Mundi> dat Testudo formation
<otakon17> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Too unknown but a good B
<Vivix> DJ_POn-3_, so mean cat ;__;
<Tommy> way to jinx it king theodon
<Tommy> what a jerk
<Vordox> I'll say this again
<otakon17> SeaponiesofLiverpool: I do
<MadSurge> LadyCanary|wubwub: one of my high school classmates hanged herself yesterday...
<Klumzeedragon> Sergio_Scriptor: It was pretty bad... and I usually like things dragon related.
<Vordox> THIS PS2 GAME WAS AWESOME
<Fl00tersh41> He just had to go and jinx the whole siege
<Tovler> SeaponiesofLiverpool: That's that dragon movie, right?
<Rex_Mundi> here come chariots of fire
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> that influenced my childhood
<DJ_POn-3_> Vivix: ikr they always get in the way
<otakon17> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Based off of "The Dragon an the George"
<Sergio_Scriptor> Klumzeedragon: oh boy we are in for a ride tonight :\
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> we should watch it non-BMN
<Rex_Mundi> A hero to all orc kind
<Vivix> and sleeping on keyboards- cats, so attention want
<Klumzeedragon> Vordox: I had it for GameCube!
<Vivix> still. <3 u cat
<Tommy> Olympics being held at Helm's deep this year are cancelled due to terrorist attack
<Vordox> Klumzeedragon: It was AWESOME right? :D That fighting engine
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flight_of_Dragons
<Sergio_Scriptor> Tommy: :D
<Klumzeedragon> Sergio_Scriptor: :) I'm sure we'll make the best of it.
<Tovler> I want my B movie to win so I can start a trend of good indie movie being picked.
<Tovler> good yet recent
<Michael> hai everypony :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I picked Kostner's Postman
<otakon17> Damn they're suicidal
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hich I always include
<Sergio_Scriptor> Klumzeedragon: indeed :) i think in here we could watch birdemic and even that we could make it interesting :P
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> because it is a good movie
<alexxm> how you doing Michael
<Klumzeedragon> I never saw Flight of Dragon. :O But it reminds me of the art style of Fern Gulley.
*Michael hugs alexxm
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> kinda
<Vordox> DWARF BOMB
<Michael> alexxm: good, you?
<Sergio_Scriptor> SeaponiesofLiverpool: i actualy like the postman :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Okay before I go eat I have one thing to say about Greenlight
*alexxm hugs Michael back i'm good
<otakon17> Launch the Dwarf!
<Tovler> the art style is not like Fern Gully at all
<Klumzeedragon> Hi Michael!
<Tovler> its Rankin Bass
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> when it came out it didn't do well
*Michael hugs Klumzeedragon
<Rex_Mundi> Charging after only 1 volly? Aragorns a crap commander
<CrimsonPhoenix> It seems anyone can post anything, I admit that I just now know about this thing but I say that anyone able to post anything is pretty BS
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I want it ponified
<Fl00tersh41> Rex_Mundi: yup
<otakon17> Klumzeedragon: Um no more like Ralph Bakshi or the Rankin Bass animations
<CrimsonPhoenix> now BRB
<Tommy> He's too worried about that melee vs ranged penalty
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> with Derpy as Kevin Kostner
<Sergio_Scriptor> SeaponiesofLiverpool: it's just misunderstood,like water-world,i think it's awesome :)
<Vordox> Toledo
<Vordox> :D
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> water-world was a box office success actually
<otakon17> Hiya Derpy_Hooves
<Fl00tersh41> Rex_Mundi: They could have just hung back and kept lobbing volleys of arrows into the choke point
<Klumzeedragon> Sergio_Scriptor: Don't know about that. Two movies have been banned from here before. xD
<Ponies47> BRB
<otakon17> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Too bad it was boring as hell

<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i love all pies
<otakon17> Tovler: Too new too risky to get
<Rex_Mundi> Fl00tersh41: Exactly, the should have waited for the orcs to climb uphill to him whilst raining arrows on them.
<Klumzeedragon> otakon17: if you say so! Not sure I've seen those.
<Michael> ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> except cowpies

<Sergio_Scriptor> Tovler: i was there :3
<otakon17> Tovler: Too new
<Fl00tersh41> Rex_Mundi: Not many orcs would have made it through in the first place untill the elves ran out of arrows
<otakon17> Tovler: 1.5 years
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Postman: budget: 80 bill USA earn 17 bill
<Fl00tersh41> Rex_Mundi: By then they'd have plugged the whole in the wall with orc corpses
<Tommy> Aragorn must be getting tons of xp

<EspyLacopa> Goddamn newb elves, get to the keep!

<Rex_Mundi> Where was Gondor when Littlefoots mom was killed by Sharptooth?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> they are Gon dur
<Barbetos|AtWork> Tovler: Gonder had very posh party it had to attend. Aparently Gondor is very apathetic to the folly of its brothers.
<CCCP> :'(
<EspyLacopa> Suddenly trees.
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: Crying its eyes out bc it was 8 when it saw it(me)
<Klumzeedragon> Rex_Mundi: Eating them tree stars!

<IMI_Galil> Shatner's character is awesome
<OohShiny> Avril Lavigne?
<SirGanjalf> Racoon is Bruce
<fluttercry> 05,15wut
<Deadlypon3> Sumica if there is one thing babout Dreamworks, it's that they get big actors
<pony_300> Gary Shandling... I remember that name from some old tv show...
<IshNewLaptopPony> Racoons die when they are killed
<RainbowAsh> I had no idea Bruce Willis was in this movie
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: Yep.
<RosePetal> This movie will be good.
<sonicrainboomer259> qeue awesome song
<shogipony> i remember this as a furry webcomic

<MrPine23> Bruce Willis in MLP. Make it happen.
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties the movie is okaaay
<Michael> Camelot?

<TovlerTheHedge> Shatner is also a opossum
<Nyst> That's a lot of big names. Though I wonder what the deal is with putting actors in movies. Surely a quality voice actor is better and cheaper then big name actors? Or do their names help sell the movie?
<sonicrainboomer259> suddenly turtle

<RAWRity> I'll give the film this: it des a good job of capturing the satire of the comic strip.
<Elit3xPon3> ABUSE
<DSNesmith> it's certainly not glorifying consumer culture
<TovlerTheHedge> light social commentary
<Kurra> gotta keep russian, russian...
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties True :P
<RosePetal> Maybe they should get more food so that the animals and Bear all have the great amount of food.

<Deadlypon3> "Yay for donuts"
<alfopony> YAY
<StinkomanFan> BEES
<RainbowAsh> Ghosties, he is arguably the villain, so what is wrong with that?
<Ghosties> 04Pizza and donuts for breakfast
<Sumica> 00,10they already lost there foraging grounds
<Nyst> So hang on, they left a bear inside that small patch of green?
<Ghosties> 04How sad
<Elit3xPon3> donuts
<Kandarihu> Globalization = Mutually Assured Economic Destruction, right? The whole plan to tie every country's economies together to make it suicidal for any country to try to destroy any other country?
<DSNesmith> y'ever had coons invade your garage
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He wants to give the foragers chemical-laden food so he can be saved from a bear why?
<BronyInstrumental> PillowPoni|Minecraft: i got nothing from the search :/
<MrPine23> Nyst it was a dream
<Meanwhile> He's a bear. All he has to do is find an old persons garden to live in.
<Cypresswolf> that wasnt honey :(
<Ghosties> 04Because RJ isn't going to get his
<DSNesmith> pizza and donuts is great compared to what they eat
<sonicrainboomer259> eww
<OohShiny> are you sure your stomachs can digest that?
<Ghosties> 04He's pretty much the main character
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> BronyInstrumental: Whaaa? That's odd....
<alfopony> u lie
<Michael> dat crunch
<RosePetal> Tree Bark for food. Now they should just eat that instead.
<Sounds> Lovely!! JUST LOVELY!
<Elit3xPon3> omnomnomnom
<Deadlypon3> Nittany_Discord to make THEM pick it up for him
<Meanwhile> Bears don't wander through peoples gardens without being hit by tranq darts.
<Nyst> MrPine23: and before too?
<SpeedyBolt> This acutally made me want to eat logs.
<Buytoast> he wants them to forage for him
<DaringDerpy> Ghosties: if you prefer bark for breakfast, no one is stopping you
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, because he doesn't want to be killed by the bear
<StinkomanFan> He's a BEAR, he does whatever the fuck he wants
<Buytoast> so he cans teal it
<sonicrainboomer259> dat acting
<AlienWarhead> Nittany-Discord it will make sense later
<RosePetal> Nomnomnomnomnnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnom.

<sonicrainboomer259> LOL
<Rustymeat> FANTASTIC
<CrimsonPhoenix> that....wasn't needed

<Austin> i am a dirtbag
<fluttercry> 05,15There are way to many big names to be in a movie like this
<otakon> Ghosties: I love the jabs that this movie makes
<SpeedyBolt> Get the food, feed the bear
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh
<otakon> O_O
<rabidsonic220> I love the subtle humor
<TovlerTheHedge> Whoa, now he sounds like Bruce Willis
<otakon> NOT THE FOOD!
<Cypresswolf> :O Phil's not a real doctor?
<Obsidian> wat
<alfopony> O_o
<Bubbles97> you dumb turtle
<RainbowAsh> Red wagons are cursed in this universe
<ImmaBear> how did those porcupine kids hotwire an ac converter without the knowledge to do so
<RosePetal> Verne!
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties the worst thing about the movie is Verne...
<TovlerTheHedge> Dr. Tran is a real doctor
<Sumica> 00,10cause it is Bruce willis
<Ghosties> 04How is Verne the worst thing?
<RAWRity> fluttercry: it was a high profile family movie. They ALWAYS get big names for this stuff.
<SpeedyBolt> Vern is being an idiot here.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> BECAUSE ITS A SILLY MOVIE
<Ghosties> 04RJ is the worst thing
<MrPine23> Poor Angel
<SpeedyBolt> If he returns them, he'll get killed.
<OohShiny> Kill angel!
<alfopony> dat rabbit
<Michael> damn angel
<StinkomanFan> ImmaBear, practice
<RosePetal> True, Verene your techinally killing the animals.
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: I agree.
<Ghosties> 04He pretty much caused a massive imbalance to their habitat
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> uh oh
<AlienWarhead> Don't end up like angel
<Klumzeedragon> *hugs CCCP* We're here for ya~
<RosePetal> So they won't get food.

<Bubbles97> PLAY?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DOG!
<Derpy_Hooves> Play?

<Michael> oh my god
<AJIsAwesome> Am I the only one who thinks Ghosties's points are reasonable?:S
<Major> PLAY!!!!!!!!
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties RJ (Bruce Willis) is at least a little bit interesting. Verne is bland, annoying, and often disrupting other people
<MrPine23> AlienWarhead: Angel can get hurt.
<RosePetal> Just tell them about the bear? Again they will help you.
<rjhoney> DOGGIE
<Kurra> Play? :3
<Sumica> 00,10Play?

<ImmaBear> PLAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!
<RaveBrony> Rotty!!! <3 <3
<RainbowAsh> Ghosties, to be fair, the guys that bulldozed their woods over caused the imbalance. RJ is just introducing them to what their home was changed to
<RAWRity> and then Bert died. And everyne was happier for it.
<Malk> Scooby Doo
<Mozdoc> Awwww, the doggie is just a diant marshmallow. Pllaaaaaayy!
<TovlerTheHedge> knowutimean?

<StinkomanFan> Verne is is name
<Kandarihu> Is anyone else having framerate issues? Or is it just my PSO2 + Gameguard being a system hog?
<Meanwhile> ...Verne.
<RAWRity> I'm calling him bert
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> LOL
<Meanwhile> Bert. Pfft.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> so much destruction
<Deadlypon3> MrPine23 you mean the two things good about Zack and COdy?
<Everlasting_Joy> Kandarihu: It's fine here.
<OohShiny> JESmith71 the Dog from Up is waaaaaaaay better
<RosePetal> In fact, you trust them now. Tell them "Hey, I need to get more food, there's this bear that wants to kill me. Can you help me?" Or "I need your help to save me from this bear."
<Austin> go vern!
<Malk> Play TF2 I think he means

<Crippler> oh god
<AlienWarhead> That is one strong dog
<Deadlypon3> RosePetal RJ has trust issues :P
<Mozdoc> Nuclear explosion incoming...
<OohShiny> uh oh

<Cypresswolf> It's raining chips O_o

<otakon> that's TWO Micheal Bayslosions so are
<RaveBrony> Youre the devil
<sonicrainboomer259> mini nuke

<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Ka-BEWWWWWM
<Elit3xPon3> BOOOOM
<RosePetal> Until, we meet again.
<otakon> You're the devil
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Shit
<AlienWarhead> War, war never changes
<Kirusaki_Pony> Their sliding down the pole.
<Pale_Horse> I know that woman is the "villain" of the piece... but is it wrong that I still find her kind of hot?
<ImmaBear> no IshBestPony is the devil
<Ghosties> 04So what we have is a situation that could potentially end in disaster. The subdevelopment caused their woods to dwindle, thus endangering their habitat. Then RJ shows up and destroys their natural eating habits, and then the terminator shows up to kill the animals that have shown up in their homes to get food to live
<TovlerTheHedge> This movie is insensitive to the Japanese survivors
<MrPine23> Wait. a bunch of food can cause an explosion. Science? What's that?
<CCCP> dead
<Mozdoc> That whole scene right there was my absolute favorite of the entire film.
<Klumzeedragon> Shows all the good crap we put in our food at work.
<Malk> HE SAID DEVIL HE BROKE THE RULES
<OohShiny> lol
<SpeedyBolt> ...and now its all gone
<alfopony> troll
<DSNesmith> holy wall of text batman

<Kurra> wat.
<Bubbles97> NO
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties I think your look too much into this :p
<RosePetal> NOOOOOOOOOOO!
<XAX> God damn Ghosties. That sub-plot.
<Meanwhile> Verrrn
<AlienWarhead> Mrpine23 they had a propane tank
<Cypresswolf> The welcome wagon is destroyed, but hey free chips - almost
<SpeedyBolt> Drop.
<RosePetal> The food is gone.
<OohShiny> destroyed
<SpeedyBolt> WE LIKE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pretty bad, Ghosties :/
<SpeedyBolt> YOU KNOW
<Elit3xPon3> gone
<DSNesmith> lol at fingerless gloves
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> totally

<Tassadork> yep. it's avril lavigne

<TovlerTheHedge> y'know?
<RaveBrony> yep
<Elit3xPon3> your all whatever
<ImmaBear> you're like whatever
<SpeedyBolt> This scene
<DSNesmith> much worse than bark, surely
<RAWRity> speaking of Propane: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8rh93ekYg1rqk433o1_500.jpg
<SpeedyBolt> It's so sad.
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties it's still better than...starving
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<manhi40> i remember this movie from when i was a child
<RosePetal> Techinally, they should be mad. Verne food.
<Malk> Ghosties Poweraid is good for you

<RaveBrony> yeah, see?
<Ghosties> 04>globalization
<RosePetal> Verne, you don't understand that a bear is trying to kill him.
<MrPine23> Ghosties: I thought that since the beginning of the movie.
<CrimsonPhoenix> With Dreamworks, don't think about the story
<Ghosties> 04I get it movie
<Pale_Horse> Animals don't know that saccharine causes cancer. :P
<Elit3xPon3> LOL
<OohShiny> I love her voice, sounds like a black woman talking

<DSNesmith> ouch
<SpeedyBolt> ...Wow
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and people in main chat not getting that the teenager character is acting stereotypicaly teenage to make fun of it
<ImmaBear> Whats the matter Verne, could it be you're craving RJ's mcnuggies
<CCCP> Ghosties lol
<Obsidian> ouch
<DSNesmith> dayum
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ouch
<SpeedyBolt> Nice choice of words.
<Bubbles97> :'(
<Crippler> yes u r

<graywhoof> oh snap
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> :(
<Rustymeat> awww
<manhi40> yes, yes you are
<fluttercry> 05,15AlienWarhead I'd totally be down for that
<Meanwhile> Nice going there Verne.
<RosePetal> Techinally, you would be dead in a week.
<CCCP> :(
<Ghosties> 04God, this movie is awful
<DrSteveSCARz> D:
<Rustymeat> not hammy
<Kirusaki_Pony> Shit just got real
<Ghosties> 04Fuck this movie
<crazypony> :'(
<Elit3xPon3> awwww
<otakon> YOU INSULTED PINKIE SQUIRREL!
<Austin> playing video games, texting, talking in chat, and watching a movie. multitasking at its best:D
<oneoneeighteight> what a jerk
<AJIsAwesome> Can't we just accept Ghosties opinions?:S
<Rosfox> :'( AWwwwww
<RainbowGuy> Verne hit the fail button SOOO HARD
<RosePetal> If you did it Verene's way.
<otakon> Ghosties: are you serious?
<DSNesmith> lol ghosties really doesn't like this movie
<Elit3xPon3> nooooo aaaawwwwwwwwwwww
<DrSteveSCARz> :(
<MrPine23> Tank, you're a jerk.
<Crippler> STELLAAAAAAA
<alfopony> no cleaning that up
<XaviortheSavior> shut up ghosties I'm trying to enjoy the movie.
<Michael> you betrayed us!
<otakon> Tank, WHY?
<SpeedyBolt> Hammy... :(
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> :'(
<ImmaBear> Whats the matter Verne-kun, could it be you're craving RJ's mcnuggies
<rabidsonic220> D:
<Fou_Lou> Ghosties: could you please explain for me why globalization is so bad?
<alfopony> :'(
<Rustymeat> HAMMY
<crazypony> :'(
<Barbetos> Yeah. Hammy not stoopid. He retarded!
<Quick_Thinker> you just got TwilghtSparkled
<Everlasting_Joy> Can't say I disagree with him DSNesmith.
<Buytoast> and the fucking raccoon ruins the group
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> this song
<rjhoney> no hammy D:
<DrSteveSCARz> Song time
<FlutterMEDIC> :'(
<Kirusaki_Pony> Hammy: Fuck this.. I'm stickin to acorns.
<OohShiny> the movie goes on so fast
<StinkomanFan> God Dangit Verney
<AlienWarhead> speech 1
<Moopy> nice going
<SpeedyBolt> This song + that moment = crying
<DrSteveSCARz> :.(
<Mozdoc> See, this sucks. Why does the most hilarious part of the movie have to be immediately followed by such a downer part?
<RAWRity> To be fair, Verne's way was actually incredibly inefficient, and he has no real reason to suspect RJ. and hell, RJ had a damn good idea of getting food.
<Elit3xPon3> awwww
<sonicrainboomer259> i hait turtlwz
<DSNesmith> eh, I dunno, maybe I just didn't have high expectations, but I'm enjoying it decently
<RX-78-SweetieBot> People seem to be taking this movie waaaaay too seriously.
<RainbowAsh> Ghosties, I think they established that their usual food sources were gone. So Vern's alternatives are subpar by their standard. So their situation is kind of desperate when RJ turns up.
<RosePetal> Techinally, RJ is kinda the hero because he's giving them food but Verne is giving it away so they would starve so either way RJ is kinda right.
<AJIsAwesome> Fou_Lou: Because there needs to be balance for EVERYTHING.
<Kandarihu> Fou_Lou, that's not Ghosties' opinion, it's the movie writers' opinion.
<DSNesmith> although this is an unnecessary montage
<Cypresswolf> aww
<manhi40> so emotional!
<ImmaBear> I would be all "Abloo bloo bloo" and what not if not for teh crappy pop rock
<Michael> sooo sad
<SpeedyBolt> Full moon?
<Crippler> BEAR
<Elit3xPon3> :'(
<Klumzeedragon> ALL THE FEELS.
<alfopony> i see luna
<RosePetal> Uncle RJ.
<OohShiny> lol
<rjhoney> dem feels
<Elit3xPon3> hnng
<SpeedyBolt> He ate Luna.
<Kandarihu> Probably the opinion of the executive who commissioned this movie.
<otakon> Welp RJ is dead
<AlienWarhead> La da La Daw
<Austin> Anyone got a PS3 and wanna play castle crashers and watch this at the same time?
<Quick_Thinker> and the bear would get here how exactly !?
<rabidsonic220> HOLY SHIT HE JUST ATE THE MOON
<Michael> not woona!
<MrPine23> He ate the moon. S*it got real.
<OohShiny> HE ATE LUNA. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<MrPine23> Poor Luna
<Elit3xPon3> lolol
<ImmaBear> Nick Nolte is best bear
<RAWRity> Again, why didn't he just run the fuck away.
<Pale_Horse> Luna Nuuuuuuuuuuuu! :(
<DaringDerpy> reminds me to the people who interpreted mlp as sexist and homophibic
<RosePetal> NOW YOU WILL PAY FOR EATING WOONA.
<Crippler> dat feel. lol
<RainbowGuy> He should be sage from the bear, seeing that he'd have to cross through the neighborhood to get to them :P
<Quick_Thinker> and the bear would get here how exactly !?
<Lecho> spam
<Deadlypon3> Quick_Thinker I dunno
<Elit3xPon3> luna!
<Michael> bear will pay for eat woona!

<Bubbles97> fluttershy does not approve!:[
<Everlasting_Joy> Wow. . . This movie sucks.
<Elit3xPon3> noooo

<DSNesmith> ooookay
<Klumzeedragon> Crippler: No kidding! 'You have died!'
<alfopony> O_O
<Kurra> this movie sucks? I thought it was really neat.
<ImmaBear> he so jelly
<DSNesmith> "there's places in my shell even I haven't been.... want to explore?"
<SpeedyBolt> This movie was and will always be awesome
<MrPine23> SpeedyBolt: That's because it's Garry Shandling
<RosePetal> I want to be like you.
<DaringDerpy> I like the movie.
<MrPine23> brb guys
<Elit3xPon3> kool
<SpeedyBolt> Oh, that makes sense.
<Ghosties> 04<TovlerTheHedge> who the fuck is seeing this global conspiracy shit in a kids movie? <-- first off, it's not a global conspiracy when this shit happens all the time
<RosePetal> I don't know.
<XaviortheSavior> I like this movie. It's all right.
<rjhoney> i love this movie! :p
<AlienWarhead> Kurra a lot of people here are on the fence with this movie
<FlutterMEDIC> Ghosties has a point
<RosePetal> I'm just saying there are some things.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ghosties: Yup.
<DSNesmith> it's not a conspiracy, it's called "advertising"
<Kurra> AlienWarhead on the hedge....?
<RAWRity> this movie's biggest problem is that it's not sure what it wants t be. Does it want to be a satire to entertain the parents, or a safe, inobtrusive time waster for the little kids to start at for 80 minutes? It fluctuates between the two.
<DSNesmith> also this is hardly advertising
<DSNesmith> no brand names, it's making fun of the culture
<RosePetal> He's telling the truth.
<Ponies47> Well. TIME TO GO COMPUTER SHOPPING! See you guys later! :)
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> busted?
<AJIsAwesome> FlutterMEDIC: THANK YOU!
<AlienWarhead> Kurra :D
<DSNesmith> it's clearly satire
<TovlerTheHedge> Ghosties: they always say it's not a conspiracy, try again (actually don't)
<CCCP> Ghosties they might not be 100% serious when saying it
<DSNesmith> yeah
<DSNesmith> I'll agree with that
<SpeedyBolt> That's a really convincing lie.
<Yahooz|Dinner> Suburbs are a global conspiracy? waaaat?

<Ghosties> 04So globalization doesn't exist?
<RosePetal> It's Santa's Checklist.
<DSNesmith> it's best when it's satirizing suburbia
<Sneaks> Dun dun dun

<Kirusaki_Pony> UH OH THEIR GOING ALL NIGHT GUYS

<Michael> ohai Pearly

<CCCP> fluttercry i mean at least you must respect that time was put into it, the VA isnt bad either
<Klumzeedragon> I give this movie 7/7 asses!
<Reikim> Yup
<Meanwhile> Aye.
<EonMaster> movie isnt anything great, but it dos get some good laughs from me, which is more than I can say about other movies
<Ghosties> 04Look, it just bothers me alright
<desertman2> Hans Zimmer does everything
<DaringDerpy> hope you don't complain about hidden meanings in ponies now
<IshBestPony> Ghosties I wanted to choose Hugo anyway
<RosePetal> Everybody dancing/100
<ArcherJoe11> Ghosties: Not everyone likes everything.
<OohShiny> 5/5 moustaches
<DSNesmith> I'm on Anvil Rock
<Meanwhile> Which I am now level 32 on.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> bruce willis o.O
<Iain> Hello Nittany_Discord
<DrSteveSCARz> <3 <3 NANS ZIMMER <3 <3
<XylemTube_> get rich quick seminars/10
<SpeedyBolt> Wazoo/10
<Spazturtle> this is why the old loto system was better, random moive
<Reikim> We're trying to coordinate getting everyone together.
<Tassadork> well these guys make suburbia sound like the hell it is
<otakon> Ghosties: so you're saying this is one of the worst movies you've ever seen on ALL aspects?
<DSNesmith> only 16 or so, been a busy week
<DrSteveSCARz> HANS*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Iain.
<rjhoney> 7 asses! xD
<RosePetal> Humans are evil/10
<Kandarihu> I dunno. 4.5/10
<Vivix> Ghosties, we all have things that bug us and cause us to dislike certain movies or stories, and that's totally fine, power to ya
<Reikim> I can't seem to get on Stormbluff, for whatever reason. God only knows why it's so popular.
<DSNesmith> I can't say I like it as much as I loved the original
<Cypresswolf> and I got nothing else for the others from the top of my head :(
<JESmith> At least the lotto's back to normal.
<Sneaks> *yawns* guys how can I get more energy? I want to finish brony movie night...
<Obsidian> Pony time
<Kawaii_icybeauti> wow a lot of awesome people are in this thing
<CCCP> alright/10
<Kurra> Wazoo√Spuddies
<DSNesmith> it's fine, but it seems more MMOlike
<OohShiny> this movie was fast
<pony_025073> .nick
<SpeedyBolt> TV
<DSNesmith> and it's a bit... empty
<otakon> fluttercry: you too, you're saying this is one of the worst movies you've ever watched.
<Meanwhile> I think it's a case of people going for low pop servers Rei.
<Crippler> huh, I didn't know avril lavigne was in this film.
<Ghosties> 04I'd have to include that with stuff I've seen like Overdrawn At The Memory Bank, or Space Mutiny
<BronyInstrumental> oh hello Nittany_Discord, how ya feeling today?
<otakon> and then meta
<fluttercry> 05,15otakon yeah....
<RosePetal> I thought it was okay. I still think that How To Train Your Dragon was Better.
<pony_025073> whats next?
<DalekKahn> So-So/10
<OohShiny> lol
<XylemTube_> They Mispronounced PC
<Yahooz> OH BOY I LIKE/HATE A MOVIE. LET ME VOICE MY OPINIONS SO THAT EVERYONE CAN BITCH :p
<Rookeealding> And now they are talking to all o fus
<otakon> Ghosties: yOU GAVE IT A 2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm OK.
<DSNesmith> also I miss the instanced nature
<Iain> this kinda true
<fluttercry> 05,15This was in the same league as Birdemic
<sonicrainboomer259> dat drawing/10
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Y
<alfopony> i use the computer 4 all of those
<Meanwhile> We can still move as a group as long as server transfers are free and unrestricted.
<Elit3xPon3> TV O_O
<DSNesmith> it let them do patrolling enemies
<Vivix> It's mediocre, very so, like those gasoline station movies you buy
<fluttercry> 05,15at least I laughed during Birdemic
<otakon> fluttercry: you are trolling
<Sneaks> I need some more energy.
<Ghosties> 04I'd give Space Mutiny and Overdrawn the same rating
<Vordox> fluttercry: Too wrong.
<Reikim> Hm
<TovlerTheHedge> maybe now you'll rethink disallowing 6 month old movies.
<Fou_Lou> Yahooz: sure. that way it is the internet
<DSNesmith> lol just like god in star trek 2
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: We should stream that.:D
<Ghosties> 04Even though Overdrawn had motherfucking Raul Julia
<IshBestPony> Its okay not to like something but don't be a dick about it
<Reikim> We could always all move to a low-pop server.
<Crippler> KHAAANNN
<Malk> STAR TREK 2
<Ghosties> 04And Raul is awesome
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even the end song had bad taste.
<RosePetal> Are they in the computer screen!?
<Dark_Horst> and then there was star trek
<Cypresswolf> The porcupine cubs became experts at engineering and turned the forest into a lair Robotnic would drool over
<FlutterMEDIC> KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
<otakon> fluttercry: seriously Birdemic is horribad
<fluttercry> 05,15otakon I'm really not trolling. I would have given it up by now.
<CCCP> fluttercry birdempic made me lose faith in humaity
<DSNesmith> anyone tried WvW yet?
<AJIsAwesome> IshBestPony: Agreed.
<Meanwhile> Exactly. If we were so inclined.
<Malk> DAMN IT ITS JIM
<DSNesmith> my server's getting their ass kicked
<Fou_Lou> its fun but not that good /10
<otakon> fluttercry: you're insane
<Vivix> What movie is after pony?
<Vordox> It's a very shallow movie, but it made good with characters, but no risks.
<pony_025073> WHATS NEXT?
<DrSteveSCARz> Dat unfinished animation
<RosePetal> LOl it's funny because Shatner was in Star Trek.
<SpeedyBolt> Dirt is pretty good.
<Meanwhile> We're shredding WvW atm.
<otakon> I don't believe this
<Iain> otakon am I trolling?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> whoa
<EspyLacopa> Tastes like dirt though
<RosePetal> I got a jar of DIrt.
<DSNesmith> dis awful credit music
<Klumzeedragon> Intermission or next movie?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> pony_025073: The stare master, then dragon wars, the heart warming's eve.
<Ghosties> 04Vordox is right, it's just a really shallow movie that I thought was tasteless
<otakon> Ghosties, fluttercry are rating this super low
<SpeedyBolt> >Awful
<pyrocatboy> This is one one of those movie where you are supposed to TURN OFF YOU FUCKJ
<Dr_Fumbles> Anybody who says this is the worst movie they've seen clearly has NOT seen too many movies... You would not believe the shit I've seen...
<manhi40> WHATS NEXT
<SpeedyBolt> I like it, though :<
<StinkomanFan> WvW?
<LunarSS> fluttercry: you're allowed to hate it, but may I ask why?
<manhi40> ?
<Fou_Lou> dont really care for celeb VAs
<Kurra> dat pica
<CCCP> IshBestPony did you ignore me?
<Vivix> otakon not everyone like what everyone else likes, what I may rate a full score others might rate a 0, and vice versa
<Sneaks> "It's a cup of dirt"
<RosePetal> Pony episode.
<Reikim> Shucks, I really want to get on Stormbluff right now. Related: maybe that's why it's full?
<XaviortheSavior> this song is meh imo
<OohShiny> boom
<otakon> I think he meant MvM
<TovlerTheHedge> I don't know why I'm complaining about Gentrification. It's brought us nice grocery stores.
<IshBestPony> CCCP yes
<DSNesmith> MvM?
<Meanwhile> World vs World. Guild Wars 2 pvp.
<JESmith> The lotto didn't close yet did it, since you only sent it out a couple hours ago?
<FlutterMEDIC> I got a jar of Diiiirt! I got a jar of Diiiiiirt! And guess what's inside it!
<Reikim> No, he means WvW.
<CCCP> IshBestPony :'(
<Reikim> Silly otakon.
<Sneaks> "Just put an F on that and let me go ho-ome. *chuckles*"
<Sweet_Tea> i like the original song better XD
<Yahooz> Ghosties: "yes, Vordox is right because he agrees with me" XD
<DSNesmith> WvWvW if you want to be technical
<fluttercry> 05,15LunarSS I think the comedy falls completely flat, to the point where it's actually painful
<otakon> Vivix: even if you don't like it it's not a 2/10
<EspyLacopa> FlutterMEDIC: Dirt?
<Sweet_Tea> more swears...
<RosePetal> Again it's their opoinion.
<pyrocatboy> This is one one of those movie where you are supposed to TURN OFF YOU FUCKING BRAIN!!!!!
<Meanwhile> Yeah that's gonna get odd. MvM Mann vs Machine on TF2.
<DSNesmith> I haven't tried it out yet
<Vordox> Ghosties: But guess what, Life can be shallow too :P
<OohShiny> lol
<SpeedyBolt> Sudden song chage
<BronyInstrumental> Sneaks: brian regan ftw /)
<FlutterMEDIC> EspyLacopa: DIRT
<CCCP> your a meanie pants IshBestPony
<Ghosties> 04Good generalizing there, Yahooz
<SpeedyBolt> I want to play the game for this movie again.
<Vordox> As I said, I enjoyed watching it ONCE, not wanna see it again.
<otakon> so what is WvWvW?
<IshBestPony> CCCP you stinky doody heasd
<Yahooz> Ghosties: its what i do ^_^
<Reikim> I refuse to touch PvP until I'm not a noob.
<Iain> hey FlutterMEDIC
<DrSteveSCARz> Oh celestia this song
<IshBestPony> *head
<Ghosties> 04You're pro, mang
<TovlerTheHedge> My movie had a much better moral. Lying makes an interesting person.
<OohShiny> SpeedyBolt there was a game?
<Vivix> otakon, dependso n how you rate, I rate this 4/10 because it's--very generic, but- that's me
<SpeedyBolt> Yeah
<RosePetal> DreamWorks problem is too many pop culture references. If they toned it down then it would be fine.
<Cypresswolf> FlutterMEDIC: A jar of derp? are pancakes inside it? :P
<FlutterMEDIC> Iain: hi
<Fou_Lou> otakon: it can be because were not reviewers and its all subjective
<Sneaks> What MLP:FIM episode is next fellow bronies?
<DSNesmith> it's basically large scale pvp
<Vordox> I'm a human, therefore we all are humans
<DSNesmith> but, uh
<Meanwhile> WvW is Guild Wars 2s big pvp games.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Stare NMAste
<JESmith> Stare Master
<Sneaks> OH YAH!
<IshBestPony> Ghosties you guys should have just went with my original choice
<FlutterMEDIC> Cypresswolf: Dirt. AND IT'S MINE!
<DSNesmith> they fucked the skill system so bad that it's basically just button spamming
<Ghosties> 04Probably the worst "A" movie I've ever seen is Hancock though
<Elit3xPon3> stare master
<SpeedyBolt> I played it all the time on my gamecube.
<Sneaks> STARE MASTER FTW!
<Iain> FlutterMEDIC do you a TF2 account
<Kurra> May i remind the channel that Dreamworks also created How to Train your Dragon.
<Ghosties> 04God knows I hated Hancock
<Agrold> I thik this movie was average. Not bad, but not good either. I wouldn't mind watching it again, but I would probably do something else while watching it.
<manhi40> what movie is next>'
<Elit3xPon3> YEAH
<Michael> yay i love dat ep
<manhi40> ?
<otakon> Ghosties: that I can agree with
<Vivix> Hancock? Never seen
*DrSteveSCARz actually reads credits
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I have skin. Potatos have sikin. Therefore, I am a potato.
<Yahooz> Ghosties: Now THAT is a correct statement
<Kirusaki_Pony> This song is so bad...
<OohShiny> Vordox Socrates is a human, therefore socrates is mortal
<Vivix> I dislike most movies I see, but hate few
<RosePetal> Ok Ghosties that's your opinion.
<AlienWarhead> Wow I never thought this movie would generate this much hate
<Yahooz> factually
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ponies are taking a cartoon too seriously...
<Kandarihu> Dem AMD Render nodes
<DSNesmith> not sure why they decided to cut the hundreds of thousands of possible builds down to like six predetermined ones per class
<FlutterMEDIC> Iain: yes, but i uninstalled it for i'm planning to get a gaming comp
<RosePetal> How do you get lost in grocery store?
<otakon> Ghosties: I still can't see how you find this completely without worth though.
<Meanwhile> 3 servers fighting for territory and resource over massive maps that provide the dominant server with buffs.
<TovlerTheHedge> Hancock was good, then it devolved in a sitcom.
<Vordox> OohShiny: Too deep for me to understand
<Iain> oh
<Sneaks> Brb guys. I need to check on COD:Black Ops II
<Ghosties> 04Super, I'm studying to be in the field of anthropology
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: Wait, Hancock is an A movie?!:O
<SpeedyBolt> Just a quick question, BS
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties: Hancock was an A movie? It... really wasnt good.... like at all.
<LunarSS> SuperBrony64: I agree
<DSNesmith> at least it's bloody gorgeous
<Michael> Ponies are srs bussiness
<Ghosties> 04So naturally I'm predisposed
<sonicrainboomer259> this song has the most random lyrics
<SpeedyBolt> Does anybody know when Season 3 starts?
<otakon> RosePetal: have you SEEN some of the goddamn supermarkets in the US?
<fluttercry> 05,15I would say that Babes in Toyland was better but....at least I made it all the way through this one
<AlienWarhead> Later Sneaks
<DSNesmith> god these credits suck
<Reikim> God yes
<Vordox> Ghosties: Anthropology... Sounds...
<Rookeealding> It's shallow.. but I didn't think it would be anything but.. so it meet all my expectations
<DSNesmith> can we skip them
<Reikim> This game has art.
<Meanwhile> Yeah I didn't get that either, I thought the class blender system in GW1 was awesome.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> fluttercry: Who picked that movie?
<Vordox> Anthro = human/Animal mix?
<JESmith> SpeedyBolt: Next episode air time is unknown
<DSNesmith> fluttercry: you're seriously comparing that abomination to this harmless kids' flick
<FlutterMEDIC> Vordox: yes
<otakon> fluttercry: okay I know it's not the best movie ever but it's not THAT goddamn bad
<Ghosties> 04@flutter: wut
<Reikim> I mean, we are treading in artgasm territory here.
<RosePetal> I can never show this at all.
<Ghosties> 04Hell no
<SpeedyBolt> Dang.
<Reikim> Class blender?
<Elit3xPon3> is dragon wars next?
<DSNesmith> dual classes
<Michael> yes
<Ghosties> 04Babes isn't better than Hancock
<rabidsonic220> Can we watch ponie now?
<Vivix> Anthro is anything humanized Vordox, it means "To humanize" or something
<RosePetal> lol just kidding lyrics are weirder.
<Kurra> I just want to watch this channel squirm. *popcorn*
<Yahooz> fluttercry: rya serious?
<fluttercry> 05,15No no you're reading that wrong, Babes is still worse
<AJIsAwesome> Elit3xPon3: Pony episode.
<alfopony> plz be over
<Meanwhile> In GW1 you could be multiple classes at once.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Babes in toyland and epic movie are both banned in Bronystate.
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: This was that bad? Glad I missed most of it
<otakon> Vordox: no, anthropomorphism is assigning human qualities to animals
<FlutterMEDIC> we needs ponies here.
<TovlerTheHedge> don't blame the winner. He picked Hugo /me blames the mods.
<CCCP> IshBestPony but if you hugged poor me you would make me happier
<Agrold> tomorrow, can we at least play something else over the credits?:P
<Vordox> Vivix: So basically, Freaky stuff :P
<Ghosties> 04Ah, okay
<AlienWarhead> Everypony Keep calm and wait for Ponies
<RosePetal> Babes was WMC.
<Vivix> not just animals
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: It is?
<IshBestPony> CCCP nope
<Vivix> of Furryism I prefer feral
<DSNesmith> I like GW2 well enough, I just keep feeling like in six months I'll drop it and go back to GW1 again
<RosePetal> Keep calm and watch ponies.
<Kandarihu> Babes in Toyland was WMC'd because the colors caused headaches, right?
<Reikim> Well that's just awesome.
<Yahooz> Babes is not even worse, its in its own dimension of bad
<Vordox> Ghosties: I dislike your occupation
<SpeedyBolt> Guys, just quit complaining
<TovlerTheHedge> Babes was 2.5 hours long.
<otakon> Vivix: we're not talking about that
<Iain> Hey just out of curiosity does anybody here have a very special somepony? :P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome: Yup. They both can never be played again.
<Ghosties> 04Lol, okay Vordox
<Vordox> How can you say "Animals" have no "human trait"
<CCCP> IshBestPony how about in a pm?
<Vordox> That's just silly
<otakon> goddammit
*Eli hugs CCCP
<Ghosties> 04Whoa whoa
<SpeedyBolt> I havent had one, never had one
<Ghosties> 04I never said that
<Vordox> It's ALL over the world in ALL animals.
<SpeedyBolt> and i'm still happy...
<LunarSS> This movie isn't great but at least it was well made with good actors
<Meanwhile> I'll probably stick with GW2 tbh.
<IshBestPony> CCCP you get no hugs
<RosePetal> Remember Chitty from Edihiran.
<otakon> okay the hell is a feral furry?
<SpeedyBolt> -sniffle-
*CCCP huggies IshBestPony
<DSNesmith> also god these credits are bad
<Rookeealding> so only on april fools day>
<manhi40> this song, is bullshit horrible
<EspyLacopa> >_> Why is it still the same song?
<DSNesmith> yay, 2006, I guessed right
<Vordox> Ghosties: Oh?
*SuperBrony64 huggies CCCP ^-^
<AlienWarhead> Iain naw I always get friendzoned
<otakon> bc this is the second time I've seen the term come up
<RosePetal> 2006?
<Michael> wtf
<SpeedyBolt> Xtra
<FlutterMEDIC> NICE
<OohShiny> weeee
<Iain> Oh
<Sneaks> Made it back in time?
<RosePetal> It's been so long.
*CCCP huggies SuperBrony64 <3
<Michael> machine!
*IshBestPony throws CCCP off cliff
<SpeedyBolt> Fail.
<TovlerTheHedge> BONANZA!
<Bjornfot> otakon: You really wanan know, eh? ;)
<Ghosties> 04There's an anthropologist that says that language is the one thing that separates us from animals
<Vordox> According to someone anthro meant animals with human traits. <.<
<Kandarihu> manhi40, yeah. Who gets lost in the supermarket?
<Meanwhile> A feral furry?
*Kurra comes out in fursuit with 4500 alcohol markers and a sketchbook and a can of Spuddies and a big smile and glowsticks and....
<FlutterMEDIC> derp
<Cypresswolf> Jackpot!
<Rosfox> XD
<alfopony> HA!
<RosePetal> lol back where it started.
<Ghosties> 04And I'm not sure if I agree with that
<MrPine23> Look at all the food.
<Michael> oops
<Vordox> Ghosties: That's true
<Elit3xPon3> im listening to 2 livestream things, its weird
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> hahah
<Lucid> Goddamn, that's a successful fail
<otakon> so full it won't come open
<Meanwhile> I...have no idea.
<AJIsAwesome> Break the glass, RJ..............
<XylemTube_> shit!]
<DSNesmith> I wouldn't, ghosties
<MrPine23> poor RJ
<Kawaii_icybeauti> pony time!
<Michael> dat joke
<RosePetal> It's stuck!
<SpeedyBolt> DreamWorks
<Iain> I'm gonna be in the friend zone by next week
<DSNesmith> there are many differences
<SpeedyBolt> Y u so awesome
<Ghosties> 04Obviously animals have communicational skills
<Meanwhile> Someone who lives in the woods?
<otakon> Me neither
<DSNesmith> the BIG one is tools
<FlutterMEDIC> TO PONIES!
<Ghosties> 04Or traits
<otakon> fien
<SpeedyBolt> THIS
<Vordox> Ghosties: Question is, how DEEP is the language skills
<otakon> to google
<DSNesmith> animals make very, very simple tools
<MrPine23> Ponies
<Sneaks> HURRAY
<Iain> YES!!!!!!!!!!
<thelonepony> POnies!
<rabidsonic220> Hammy IS pinkie! He just broke the forth wall
<Bjornfot> well it's basically what ponies are
<Yahooz> or feelings
<EspyLacopa> Und now, for ze poniez!
*otakon shudders a bit
<Michael> ponies thime!
<RosePetal> Now time for Ponies.
<Michael> *time
<JESmith> Oh god, Megan McCarthy actually made a Cupcakes ref in a tweet
<Vivix> Anthropomorphize is a verb I think, that means to give human traits to something. Be it animal or not
<Rosfox> PONY TIME
<manhi40> YAY PONIES!
<Reikim> We know what a furry is.
<StinkomanFan> A feral furry is a crazy guy who lives in the woods dressed as a bear/bigfoot?
<rjhoney> PONIEZ
<BronyInstrumental> Ghosties: you're HERE. obviously ponies do too
<DSNesmith> but humans make weapons, agricultural tools, transportation tools
<Ghosties> 04But now, ponies
<SpeedyBolt> Squeaky Belle :3
<Applejack2012> yay pony time
<otakon> Bjornfot: so it's furries that like animals straight up
<desertman2> bleh, they're too watered down
<Reikim> We know what feral means.
<Yahooz> and now for something completely different
<alfopony> in rush
<otakon> no hands
<Pale_Horse> Dat Sweetie Belle. :)
<Elit3xPon3> YEEEAAAHHH

<Meanwhile> Oh I see.
<Elit3xPon3> RIBBON
<Reikim> Ah
<XylemTube_> Dem Physics
<Reikim> Isn't that just
<Bjornfot> otakon: If it refers to a fan then yes.
<Fou_Lou> Ghosties: i doubt were that much different than animals
<Michael> ultimate destruction from nothing!
<thelonepony> dem reactions!
<Reikim> bestiality?
<Pale_Horse> At least she didn't try to cook... :$
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 MLP intro.
<SpeedyBolt> Sweetie Belle
<Kawaii_icybeauti> it's so cute how sweetie wreks everything.
<Kurra> Darnit Sweetie Belle, adding energy to the system....
<EspyLacopa> Rube Goldberg accident
<DSNesmith> >furries
<SpeedyBolt> So cute, yet so destructive.
<Kandarihu> Elit3xPon3, I should take a screenshot of what's going on with my computer right now. It's wild
<AlienWarhead> AJIsAwesome<3
<sonicrainboomer259> Sumica pony is back
<MrPine23> Sly Sweetie Belle
<FlutterMEDIC> XylemTube_: what physics?
<otakon> Reikim: from the sounds of it yes
<Klumzeedragon> EVERYONE SING> NOOOOOW.
<Meanwhile> Where usually furry denotes the anthro fans feral does away with the human aspect entirely?
<Sneaks> Sweetie Belle does everything wrong.
<Michael> mah little pony
<Iain> ahhhhhhhhhhh
<FlutterMEDIC> AAAAAAAAAH
<AlienWarhead> AHHHHHHH
<rabidsonic220> MY LITTLE PONY
<Rosfox> AAAAHHHH
<Elit3xPon3> my bad
<SpeedyBolt> BIG ADVENTURE
<kempa> Hey CCCP, how you doin mate? Hope you remember me!
<MrPine23> tons of fun
<rabidsonic220> BIG ADVENTURE
<Elit3xPon3> AAAAHHHHHHH
<RainbowAsh> Ghosties, most animals arguably don't have symbolic languages, at least we haven't deciphered any. On the other hand, I know of no serious research effort in that direction either.
<Cavale> poor rarity
<Reikim> Pretty much.
<Reikim> I think.
<Bjornfot> But yeah, ferals are furries but in pure animal bodies. Or at least, much closer to animals than humans and wouldn't be considered physically anthropomorphic.
<String_Shredder> FRAAAAAAANCE
<SpeedyBolt> FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCE
<thelonepony> Frieeeends!!!
<FlutterMEDIC> YOU ARE ALL MY BEST FRIENDS
<DrSteveSCARz> FRIEEEENDS
<Michael> FRIEEENNDDDS!
<Klumzeedragon> My little pony!
<MrPine23> do you know you're all my very best friends
<Iain> NO GO AWAY AD IM WACHING PONIEZ!!!!
<Meanwhile> I'm going to have to point out that furries aren't neccessarily sexual in nature.
<rabidsonic220> and to know your all my best friends
<Quick_Thinker> YOUR ALL MY ENMIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<MrPine23> did it on time
<Rosfox> FRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEENDS
<Vivix> There's very much research on animal language, and I'd love to learn more-
<Reikim> Yeah, we know.

<SpeedyBolt> WHAT NOW
<Reikim> Dammit, Stormbluff Isle is just too popular.
<StinkomanFan> Again, I think a Feral Furry is a dude in a Bear/Bigfoot costume scaring the shit out of Tourists
<FlutterMEDIC> Vivix: anthropology is the study of human/animal mixes.
<Ghosties> 04Anthropology is the study of human culture and various things
<otakon> ...
<Sumica> 00,10I' did not make it, Vordox did

<sonicrainboomer259> the stare
<JESmith> MrPine23: Nah it's have to be R63 for that to work
<Vivix> I have no real educations, only music and art, and I want a proper educations so I want to--learn more abou things
<Iain> Did you hear..The yay

<Elit3xPon3> opals soon face!

<Kurra> CMC theme....
<XylemTube_> APPLEBLOOM
<Vivix> Ghosties, you want to explain it a bit or not really the place? Chat is a bit fast
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> soooo Guild wars suspended digital sales
<otakon> RAWRity: well true, i guess in a sense I'm a furry since I like the MLP characters and grew up on Disney, which uses a LOT of anthro characters
<Reikim> Technically bronies are furries, I guess?
<CrimsonPhoenix> APPLEBLOOM APPLEBLOOM APPLEBLOOM APPLEBLOOM APPLEBLOOM
<DSNesmith> SpeedyBolt, why did I laugh so hard

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> THE CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS!!!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> YAY
<otakon> it's basically liking antrho characters
<SpeedyBolt> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS
<Spanner_Pony> yay
<Reikim> Depends on how you define a furry.
<FlutterMEDIC> so much yellling

<Michael> oh shi
<Reikim> *risqué
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah snap
<RAWRity> do you enjoy ponies for the characters, or just for the idea of talking equines?
<Vordox> ........................
<Elit3xPon3> YAY
<Bjornfot> Well, ponies are technically furries since they are technically athropomorphic, they have human qualities, just not physically.
<otakon> fluttercry: we did
<SpeedyBolt> Dat terror
<otakon> RAWRity: characters
<Rookeealding> like the scare cords
<DSNesmith> fluttercry at least it's not party of one for the billionth time
<Michael> dat drama
<Iain> MEDIC!! WE NEED MORE GOLD SILK!!!!
<Rave|Gym> fluttercry: SB streamed it during this week i think
<Rosfox> ping
<SpeedyBolt> WHAT?
<kempa> SQUEAK
<FlutterMEDIC> SQUEAK!
<Kandarihu> Dat voicebreak
<otakon> ah deep conversation
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wh*crack*at?
<kempa> ha! :D
<RAWRity> otakon: then it's not really a "furry" thing by my judgment.
<AlienWarhead> It was like less than a minute to sew
<DSNesmith> I enjoy ponies for the fluid animation and the gags, honestly
<Pale_Horse> Man. Gold and jewels must be as common as mud in Equestria. :P
<Fou_Lou> when did she make the silk thingys oO
<Vordox> BAD GIRL SWEETIEBELL
<Yahooz> DISTRAIGHT
<MI9000> i fucking love rarity
<XylemTube_> Fack you Rarity

<otakon> ^
<otakon> taht too
<Yahooz> *distraught

<DSNesmith> reminds me of the good ol cartoon network days
<Applejack2012> loe Rarity too
<JESmith> It's you fault anyway
<otakon> the animation is great
<Applejack2012> love
<Elit3xPon3> rarity
<SpeedyBolt> Dem smiles.
<Yahooz> late Applebloom reaction
<Rookeealding> she's right...
<AlienWarhead> Pale_Horse seems that way
<OohShiny> dat Pong
<Reikim> I enjoy ponies in a childish way.
<AJIsAwesome> AlienWarhead: Depends on the rarity of the material needed to make it.
<Iain> sweetie belle's voice alwas cracks
<DSNesmith> some people have some sort of rage-boner about the gags
<otakon> ?
<pony_300> lol the CMC = creatures
<Alchemist> scootaloo approves
<RAWRity> Basically, if you'd be fine watching this show with a human cast, then it's nothing really to do with the anthropomorphized part.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> CUTIE MARK CRUSADER SLEEPOVER AT FLUTTERSHY'S COTTAGE!!!
<Michael> angels!
<Reikim> Ponies make me smile. I need no other reason to like them.
<otakon> how so DSNesmith?
<XylemTube_> dem Halos
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> YAY
<Cypresswolf> :) Those halos
<kempa> YAY
<otakon> RAWRity: eeyup
<DSNesmith> if the episode isn't about deep character development, they think it's plebiean garbage
<SpeedyBolt> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS SLEEPOVER AT FLUTTERSHY'S COTTAGE
<MI9000> so cute
<EspyLacopa> IT'S A TRAP!
<Iain> :)
<OohShiny> Iain that's what I find cute about here
<Rookeealding> EARDRUMS ARE GONE
<FlutterMEDIC> Pale_Horse: they are, considering that i estimate that, by Earth standards, Equestria must be in the late 1800s-early 1900s
<Applejack2012> too vute
<Reikim> Oh god yes
<Applejack2012> cute
<Reikim> The Worst Ep convos.
<MrPine23> They just used the royal Canterlot voice
<Elit3xPon3> YAY
<DSNesmith> for some reason these people are largely rainbow dash fans
<MI9000> ever so fun
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: then...they must hate every damn episode.
<Eli> pony_300: Cutie mark creatures
<otakon> DSNesmith: good lord that's SRS BIZNESS
<Bjornfot> RAWRity: I don't really know why, but I don't think I would have liked this show as much if it was with humans... and I definitely wouldn't clop to it. I'm a furry, I prefer non-humans.
<OohShiny> and fluttershy colors is normal again
<Iain> yes OohShiny
<MI9000> hey they do braid tails
<SpeedyBolt> Hi random Encounter.
<Michael> gotta go fast
<Quick_Thinker> to quote vern "your the devil" sometimes CMC

<Vordox> fluttercry: Errr.... mixed with areas really
<AlienWarhead> AJIsAwesome We do see a lot of gems in the show, but the show doesn't talk about metals a lot
<MrPine23> Fluttershy is me. the CMC are all my friends.
<RAWRity> Bjornfot: whatever floats your boat
<otakon> Bjornfot: well aren't you open...but I forget who are you..

<OohShiny> mitamaking didn't say she was good in working as a foal-sitter
<SpeedyBolt> She'll never have kids at this point.
<AJIsAwesome> AlienWarhead: It's okay.:)
<Vivix> Fluttershy will now never have Foals of her own

<DSNesmith> suffice it to say I walked into the wrong IRC room
<Rookeealding> forest is not scary enough

<Klumzeedragon> I love how they break the table and cant fix it... yet... they can completely fix up the tree house no problem!

<MrPine23> Why do you need a stethoscope to do carpentry?
<Tassadork> jackhammers too
<Elit3xPon3> hammer
<Michael> seems legit
<SpeedyBolt> Misery.
<otakon> and to think Applebloom is actually a GOOD Carpenter
<Reikim> Hm?
<mitamaking> It's a jack HAMMER
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> MI9000: beacuse the other two fillies were involved
<Reikim> In which chat?
<Bloxx> its modern art
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Apple bloom builds a treehouse....messes up table...
<Vivix> Foals are.. up to six months old, right?
<DSNesmith> octavia or whatever
<kempa> HALT! HAMMERZAIT!
<TovlerTheHedge> That table needs to be condemned
<Pale_Horse> I now imagine Fluttershy having a ridiculously agressive voice in her head sort of like Inner Sakura from naruto. :P
<Elit3xPon3> dat table
<Kurra> up to a year.
<otakon> wait
<Fou_Lou> Klumzeedragon: the house was made by applebloom alone.
<Kandarihu> I see. She's a very talented actress, but there's obviously some good voice direction here.
<Iain> its shhhh
<Bjornfot> Or, well... I don't actually identify myself as a "furry" any more (I just enjoy furry art), the fandom is pretty horrible and I don't think I'm an animal or some crazy shit like that. I didn't even have a fursona. I only got a little deep into all of that shit because I had a less than healthy obsession with Lucario... I almost got myself a freaking fursuit. Almost. Don't judge me.
<Reikim> I was told that was the chatters.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> shhh
<DSNesmith> kept trying to get people to talk about her ass
<Ryunosuke> inb4 squee

<DSNesmith> whoa, you expect me to read all that
<Kandarihu> That squee is my ping sound
<Obsidian> I lose
<AJIsAwesome> Klumzeedragon: Plus they were all working on the table at once, instead of Applebloom doing it herself.
<otakon> Bjornfot: I will not judge
<mitamaking> I lost the game
<Reikim> Yes otakon, ask Nitt. Or don't, it's kind of creepy.
<Bloxx> The squee of the gods

<DSNesmith> speaking of jokes that people take seriously

<DSNesmith> I just found the Godfather chat logs
<otakon> like?
<Yahooz> yaaaaaay
<MI9000> how long do horses live?
<BronyInstrumental> coal miners?
<Reikim> Anyway, I was told that it was the chatters making fun of Octavia's plot.
<Pale_Horse> This episode spawned so many sound clips. :P

<Vivix> Horses and ponies are the exact same species, but different breeds
<DrSteveSCARz> TACTICAL SONG INBOUBD
<MI9000> badas lulaby
<Kandarihu> Here's my theory. Years on the planet that FiM takes place on are much shorter than Earth years.
<otakon> you do NOT bring it up if you don't share it
<MrPine23> zzzzzzzzzzz........
<EspyLacopa> Hush now. . .

<Applejack2012> song!
<Quick_Thinker> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
<AlienWarhead> The CMC thought inside a cemeny
<FlutterMEDIC> INCOMING
<Kurra> Fluttershy is STILL better than Neville Chamberlain.
<Ghosties> 04TIME FOR GO TO BED
<Iain> yesh!!!!!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> she should have gotten ehr mark then...
<Michael> darn i love this part
<otakon> RAWRity: the Hetalia fandom?
<MI9000> awwww shit
<Elit3xPon3> dat voice hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggg
<Reikim> Hey look otakon, I'm stronger than you, I'm moving on from this.
<DocSane> Hit it, Sweetie!
<AJIsAwesome> Klumzeedragon: Well, they are kids. They want what they can't really have, and they haven't matured enough to know that.
<DSNesmith> I am not going to click that
<SpeedyBolt> HUSH NOW QUIET NOW
*DrSteveSCARz JUMPS
<RainbowAsh> Vivix: Mature enough to breed responsible? Is that a thing among real horses in some way?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and then Michelle time
<Meanwhile> It became a running joke that Octavia had the most gargantuan of plots and she was happy enough to roll with it.
<Obsidian> dat smile
<Iain> :S
<Bloxx> Sweetie Belle is taking us to MOTOWWWNNNN
<Kirusaki_Pony> I just had an orgasm..
<pony_300> once more SimGretina remix infects me
<Yahooz> AND NOW SOUL TRAIN
*SpeedyBolt dances
<fluttercry> 05,15dat hat
<DSNesmith> it got out of hand though
<AlienWarhead> YES
<otakon> Bjornfot: I like the hat
*Major loves Gossiple music <3
<Alchemist> preach the gospel sister!
<otakon> Reikim: dammit man don'
<Meanwhile> This was before we had rules about being out of hand.
<MI9000> dat volume
<Kirusaki_Pony> ITS A FEMALE MJ
<Bjornfot> Please ignore the V sign.
<Vivix> RainbowAsh, not naturally I think, but breeding 2 yearolds is considered unhealthy for the mare, since she's still growing- or something
<Eli> Kirusaki_Pony: eargasm
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Yahooz lol dont ya mean SOUL MANE?
<MrPine23> Sweetie Belle is Gloria Estefan
<CrimsonPhoenix> Goddamn Michelle is awesome
<Major> *gospel
<mitamaking> So we all know Sweetie's cutie mark is music right
<Iain> Dancing poni at the corner
<SpeedyBolt> Ow!
<Yahooz> And yet, she cant find her talent
<Ghosties> 04Dance it out, Sumi
<otakon> Reikim: do not bring it up if you don't intend on sharing it
<Major> ^
<Reikim> mfw Bjornfot reminds me of one of my friends.
<Sumica> 00,10nah
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: technically this is WHY we have those rules now
<DSNesmith> see the problem is that if you act ironically
<Kawaii_icybeauti> she should get a fat black women.
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: :D
<Kirusaki_Pony> WE AT CHURCH PRAISE THE LORD
<SpeedyBolt> WHOA
<Michael> omg Fluttershy sheed!
<Rookeealding> dang they fast
<OohShiny> they are fast
<RX-78-SweetieBot> If rawrity is talking about what I think he is then its a fandom that is 99% fujoshi
<alfopony> dat sister got soul
<DocSane> mitamaking: Everyone does...except Sweetie Belle
<MrPine23> That's your siblings Scootaloo
<RainbowAsh> Vivix, ah, I see. Thanks for clarifying. ^^
<DSNesmith> people who take you seriously will join
<AlienWarhead> WHOA
<Kurra> o.o;
<Applejack2012> Scoots
<Elit3xPon3> OW!
<Meanwhile> One of my favourite things to do at the time was motorboat her plot.
<SpeedyBolt> So many Scootaloo.
<Alchemist> inb4 they say "asshole"
<Yahooz> nice timing
<Iain> nah I was talkin' bout applejack
<Reikim> otakon: I was explaining that Maid Hour got out of hand. That was all I was required to share. You're the one pressing for details.
<Pale_Horse> It's hard to say how long MLP ponies live. Regular ponies only live a few decades but Equestira has good medical technology and working magic. And we humans ourselves live about 3 times longer than we "should".
<Sumica> 00,10scoot lost her wings again
<DSNesmith> oh, right, godfather chat
<Vivix> and since chat suddenly exploaded I'll repeat: Pony is a height classifications as far as I remember, so ponies are horses- I don't think there's much of an lifelength difference
<Jigglysaint> scootaloo hearding scootaloo
<thelonepony> catch scootaloos family
<otakon> Reikim: okay
<DSNesmith> nobody remembers that?
<Applejack2012> somepony call AJ
<FlutterMEDIC> hey, its a chicken
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Sumica: You times that well!
<Jigglysaint> chickenception
<otakon> DSNesmith: enoep

<OohShiny> Sumica thanks for pointing that out
<Iain> chillin with mah peeps
<Reikim> I wasn't here for it.
<RAWRity> btw, found it.
<BronyInstrumental> animation 3rr0r
<Elit3xPon3> scootaloo: chillin' with my homeboy
<DrSteveSCARz> OBEY!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> OBEY
<FlutterMEDIC> so many Scootaloos
<DSNesmith> so we all thought the godfather was dreadful
<mitamaking> it's coming
<SpeedyBolt> STARE
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-scootalo hearders! YAY!
<Michael> dat stare!
<Vivix> I think MLP Ponies are humanized enough that 80-90 years would be assumable-
<DocSane> YOU SHALL DIE IN AGONY!
<kempa> DAT LOOK
<Kawaii_icybeauti> hypnoshy...
<AlienWarhead> PENANCE STARE
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> O_O
<XylemTube_> EEp
<Vordox> So AB is the willpower but has trouble with leading. Sweetie Bell is slower then usual but has creativity, And scoot we ALREADY know>.>
<Vivix> look at Granny Smith
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Rave|Gym: I don't stream pony episodes that are going to be streamed at that week's BMN :)
<Sumica> 00,10see no wings
<OohShiny> Fluttershy's got Jedi Power
<FlutterMEDIC> and one chicken
<Alchemist> power of christ compells you!
<Applejack2012> stare time
<DSNesmith> I still don't know why people like it
<Kirusaki_Pony> MIND FUCK
<Elit3xPon3> dat stare
<SpeedyBolt> BUT
<otakon> RAWRity: okay I'll admit I like it.
<MrPine23> The stare haunts my nightmares
<pony_300> Fluttershy has PSYCHIC POWAS
<fluttercry> 05,15The Godfather is fantastic
<mitamaking> She gave them the googly eye
<NocturnalBlade> AlienWarhead: LOOK INTO MY EYES!
<Bjornfot> RAWRity: i would hit that with the force of a thousand suns.
<MI9000> fail scootalo
<DSNesmith> I couldn't even pay attention after the first 20 minutes
<Rustymeat> party soft
<Azuredragon> Scootaloo has no wings
<Ghosties> 04These are not the chickens you were looking for
<Meanwhile> I've never seen it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> PARTY SOFT
<Michael> were are wings!
<Pale_Horse> Party Soft!
<Klumzeedragon> That wingless Scoot.
<EggWhite> One of the chickens is still out!
<DSNesmith> it was just italians mumbling
<OohShiny> use the FORCE!
<SpeedyBolt> Dont break a Pinkie Promise
<Kandarihu> I'm sure they'd live 80-90 years, if the years are really short.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Ghosties
<otakon> Bjornfot: what about Minerva Mink :P
<kempa> WE LIED!
<Jigglysaint> wonder where that sting comes from?
<DocSane> And Fluttershy has to sleep on her couch
<CrimsonPhoenix> seriously
<Iain> no thanks?
<Jigglysaint> er
<Tassadork> EYES
<Applejack2012> hush now
<DSNesmith> I mean it wasn't a BAD movie
<Jigglysaint> wait no that's not it
<MrPine23> Fluttershy should be able to tame Scootaloo, on account of that she's a chicken
<XylemTube_> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<CrimsonPhoenix> so many legendary jokes from season 1
<Ghosties> 04Nooooooo thannnnnnks
<Jigglysaint> music cue
<FlutterMEDIC> great, now its a chicken, a dictionary, and a marshmellow
<Kandarihu> They wouldn't be Earth years
<DSNesmith> it was just boring
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 overused Scootaloo joke
<Yahooz> Or CMC hoo-- BAD YAHOOZ
<EspyLacopa> Or perhaps their lifespan is closer to human, since they clearly -aren't- regular horses.
<Reikim> Anyway, RAWRity: stop trying to make me a furry, you're coming dangerously close to success.
<Iain> NONONONO
<DSNesmith> I don't need explosions but I do need characters I care about
<Vivix> Kandarihu, if you look at Granny we can guess that age- even if we got no indication, but real horses are not as long lived
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: i doubt the years are really short. because a foal is able to speak after its one moth old.
<mitamaking> What would that cutie mark be?
<RAWRity> Reikim: I was just sharing a pertinent picture is all.
<Bjornfot> oh otakon, you dirty...
<Pale_Horse> Maybe Scootaloo's special talent is that she's secretly got cockatrice powers. :O
<otakon> I remember there is a chart
<Vivix> They're so humanized that we can assume they have our lifelength
<DSNesmith> anyway, we were watching the euro stream
<OohShiny> MrPine23 so Twilight could handle Sweetie Belle? Because she's a dictionary and all?
<FlutterMEDIC> Metal Gear Ponies
<AlienWarhead> Sneak 9001
<Iain> bye guys I gotta go
<XylemTube_> that almost sounded like power ranger for a second
<DSNesmith> and, uh
<Elit3xPon3> go!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We almost banned maid hour due to the RP problems. It's fun to pretend sometimes, but you can't take it too far.
<DSNesmith> somebody'
<otakon> Bjornfot: what? it's a legitimate question
<Ghosties> 04Dammit Fluttershy, you're making me sleepy
<DSNesmith> *cough*
<Elit3xPon3> aww bye
<DSNesmith> started trying to entertain the chat
<Michael> bye Iain

<DSNesmith> by writing parody shipfic
<mitamaking> too quiet
<Bjornfot> Why not have a maid channel? :D

<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, I really despise that joke
<Reikim> Wait how is this relevant, Meanwhile?
<Elit3xPon3> dun dun dun
<Vivix> the infants using magic and flying might go under "magic bursts and uncontrolled stuff" they mentioned, like how infants can swim, but children can't unless they kept up the training
<alfopony> alienwarhead: in S3
<SpeedyBolt> Yup, they'll get them on the finale.
<mitamaking> Learn your lesson Fluttershy
<Sumica> 00,10hear we go.

<Spazturtle> Pale_Horse: Nope, they ever get it
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> inb4 Scoot-Scootaloo spam
<Meanwhile> It isn't. Just look at it for a minute.
<DSNesmith> good lord
<Applejack2012> they went to the con
<Kawaii_icybeauti> inb4 scootaloo
<Jigglysaint> do pegasi ever just walk?
<OohShiny> well fluttershy, you shouldn't live at the edge of the forest
<Rookeealding> Fluttershy didn't do as badly at babysitting as Pinkie did.
<CrimsonPhoenix> here we go
<DocSane> I wish the CMC would wear their capes again.,
<DSNesmith> does that octopus have teeth
<SpeedyBolt> But they'll put a dick move on us and cut the screen off before we see it
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: scoot is a special case in flying i think. either a very late bloomer or incabable
<Vordox> So I heard you like Helicopter?
<FlutterMEDIC> Pale_Horse: they do that, and the world will spontaneously combust, then implode
<Ghosties> 04Alternate Japanese episode title :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> overused lame joke
<Vordox> Also, Elijah Wood is good
<EspyLacopa> >_> Sequel Series: My Little Pony: Crusader Chronicles.
<Rustymeat> SCOOT IS CHIKEN LOLOLOLOLOL
<Kandarihu> SuperBrony64, I never noticed that. And yet this is the episode that launched that dumb meme.
<Obsidian> Here it comes
<Bjornfot> otakon, hotlinking to fj does not work
<MrPine23> And of course the infamous scene in 3...2...1..
<SpeedyBolt> Chicken.

<ingster> SCOOTALOO NOODLE SOUP
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I do not find the frontpage of funnyjunk attractive.
<RAWRity> otakon: Funny junk links never work for me, so I'm assuming this is the chart you were referencing http://derpy.me/egULy
<SpeedyBolt> Scoot-scoot-scooot-scoot
<AlienWarhead> CMC Lawyers!
<mitamaking> Kirusaki_Pony: is too
<XylemTube_> how would you even represent argueing with a cutie mark?
<kempa> where is SB btw?
<EspyLacopa> That's not arguing, that's just being contradictory.
<Reikim> OH GOD THE CEPHALOPODS ARE EVOLVING
<Kirusaki_Pony> xD
<Kurra> I really don't ike how the fandom always, always, always, without fail, predictably equeates Scoot with poultry. :/
<Pale_Horse> Eek!
<Michael> scootaloo is best chicken
<FlutterMEDIC> MrPine23: a pony head yelling?
<DocSane> The genius of the show is that the CMC aren't annoying.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MrPine23: 2 ponies with pissed faces and their mouths open..
<Vordox> MrPine23: Beurocracy
<AJIsAwesome> MrPine23: Internet flame war.
<RainbowAsh> MrPine23, 4chan logo
<pony_300> I don't understand how such a great meme originated from such a bland origin.
<SpeedyBolt> Dat screAM
<Klumzeedragon> Cutie Mark Gainsayers! YAY!
<Spazturtle> MrPine23: The youtube commet section
<OohShiny> too much squeaks
<Michael> dat squees
<Kandarihu> Fou_Lou, it seems that normal pegasi have to be enrolled in special training to fly safely.
<Quick_Thinker> arguing cutie mark would be phonix wright
<thelonepony> Scootaloo is best orange chicken
<DSNesmith> obligatory stoned jokes
<Vivix> DocSane, YES! Kids are usually always annoying
<Meanwhile> It doesn't actually have teeth though, that's just the way the inner part of its mouth is shaped.

<DocSane> Twilight almost died in this episode. Totally ignored
*RAWRity is not surprised in the least by Bjornfot's respnse
<thelonepony> XD
<Kandarihu> Er, okay. So it's not special training if every pony of a particular race is required to go through it.
<Ryunosuke> you know
<AJIsAwesome> DAT STONE JOKE
<pony_300> DON'T MOVE
<Vordox> Don't...move...
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Of the examples they give I dont really like any of them
<FlutterMEDIC> CrimsonPhoenix: bravo, you done earn 9001 internet points
<Kurra> Like a lawyer.
<Ryunosuke> a gorgon or a medusa could turn things to stone too
<Alchemist> and a fox news cutie mark appears
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<Marx> Alright, get a gold needle.
<Kandarihu> Arguing Cutie Mark: Gavel
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> looks like Twi *puts on shades* got stoned "YEEEAAAH!"
<Vordox> Alchemist: LOLOLOL
<SpeedyBolt> Any pony could die, and none of the remaining mane 6 would notice.
<Pale_Horse> Stoning is like "death-lite".... unless something shatters you... :(
<Kawaii_icybeauti> nah it's the 4chan logo
<Bjornfot> I'd prefer 50%, though.
<alfopony> >:( like this <

<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: :D
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and where's the "Dangerously Cheesy" option?
<AlienWarhead> DocSane I'm sure she would have awoken in a 1000 years
<Yahooz> A cock
<Ryunosuke> Cockatrice
<DSNesmith> I've always thought it was pronounced cock-a-TRYce
<AlienWarhead> OH MAI
<JESmith> And the body of a chicken
<Kirusaki_Pony> She cares more about the girls, than her best friend.
<Vordox> cockathingies...
<Reikim> cok-ah-triss, that's it.
<Yahooz> Silly Cock
<SpeedyBolt> Oh crap
<otakon> 10% for me is the limit
<Elit3xPon3> cock-a-thingys :3
<Kirusaki_Pony> xDDDD
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: Fly safely maybe. but fly at all should be possible for every pegasi without any special training.
<EspyLacopa> Unless you're Fluttershy, then you can stare them down.
<Applejack2012> lol
<Elit3xPon3> lolol
<AlienWarhead> Do not look a cock in the eye!
<Ghosties> 04Well, the girls are kinda the next generation
<RAWRity> now for the MLP version: http://derpy.me/VxoBC
<RainbowAsh> Never look a cockathingy in the eye.
<fluttercry> 05,15i've always heard is coco ah triss
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SHE SAID COCKATRICE WHICH SOUNDS LIKE COCK, DID YOU HEAR IT, THEY SAID COCK
<Kirusaki_Pony> That cock is hard to catch
<Ghosties> 04So it makes sense
<OohShiny> 2 scoota-loos
*Kurra uses Scan Visor. |v
<DocSane> And then Twi would be terribly depressed that she lost her best friends about two months after making them.
<Reikim> Or, to FULLY phoneticize it, kok-ah-triss
<Yahooz> ATTACK OF THE STRAY COCK
<otakon> also my mom cut her thumb and it's a flap of skin nearly falling off

<Marx> Alchemist, that one episode was shown a long time ago on here, but yeah, every now and then, there's a Samurai Jack ep on.
<Reikim> I mean, theoretically you could win with a smaller force that's better-trained, but really what are the odds of that among random anons?
<DSNesmith> hm, darwinia soundtrack

<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: Hi! Im back!
<otakon> Reikim: I sliced OFF a chunk of my finger tip to a deli slicer AND I cut the side of my hand open nearly to the bone in about a inch long gap. The finger slicing didn't stop bleeding until about 4 hours later

<prince-dari> ...
<DSNesmith> that's one of the few movies that wasn't even funny bad
<prince-dari> No there isn't.
<prince-dari> <:
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: so what is a person that thinks robots are hawt? a gearhead?
<FlutterMEDIC> Meanwhile: need link for proof
<Elit3xPon3> 8 minutes
<Reikim> Anyway, I've broken a bone...once.
<Vordox> Oh god
<Kandarihu> Leverage? And is that Battlefield Earth?
<Reikim> otakon: Technophile.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Otakon better learn to go super saying if he wants to stand a chance against freezer.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Meanwhile: dari does not like the 11th :d
<Meanwhile> dari: Apparently Weeping Angels are in it again.
<Vordox> This D-War sounds terrible! D:
<DSNesmith> we saw Battlefield Earth before WMC was around, didn't we
<RX-78-SweetieBot> A /m/an.
<Moopy> yay
<FlutterMEDIC> GONDOR...ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<mitamaking> There it is
<DSNesmith> because we watched it twice
<otakon> DSNesmith: eeyup
<prince-dari> You have to be shitting me.
<Meanwhile> Sergio_Scriptor: I know this, which is why I'm telling him.
<Reikim> I broke my tibia once. By tripping over a ball. It was embarrassing.
<DSNesmith> it was even more soul-crushing the second time
<Klumzeedragon> Vordox: It iiiiis!
<Yahooz> numbah 12?
<otakon> I think it would get WMC nowadays though
<p4ngya> is the drawing during Euro Movie Night?
<prince-dari> DIDN'T THEY FUCKING RUIN WEEPING ANGELS ENOUGH LAST TIME?
<prince-dari> WHY?!
<Meanwhile> No they did not.
<DSNesmith> WMC gets called too often
<Vivix> hehe
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Derpy
<Meanwhile> Now there are baby ones.
<prince-dari> WHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!?!?
<RAWRity> I imagine the Chat had too much fun with battlefield Earth to bring in WMC anyway
<Moopy> sorry guys im just excited here
<DSNesmith> only a few have really deserved it
<Vordox> Huh DaringDerpy ?
<prince-dari> Fuck's sake.
<Reikim> WMC has been callede /twice/.
<Vordox> Dari?
<otakon> I can hear Shizuka yelling "LEVERAGE" from here
<DSNesmith> coughbabesintoylandcough
<otakon> Reikim: three times
<Obsidian> lol
<Yahooz> I think we broke dari
<DalekKahn> Dari just heard 4 knocks
<Austin> What did i miss?
<Reikim> What? A third?
<Vivix> first time I saw weeping angels in..Tennant, was greaaat, until they were rocking the Tardis back and forth in the basement, then I just lost it
<RAWRity> WMC is when something is so awful the chat can't even make it entertaining.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14WMC was after Battlefield Earth
<DSNesmith> epic movie was also pretty horrendous, but I dunno if it was WMC
<FlutterMEDIC> sliding Derpy
<Meanwhile> Yahooz: What is this "we" you speak of.
<DoctoDoctorWho> and now I leave! I shall return and bring with me a peacful chat!
<otakon> Babes
<prince-dari> Excuse me. There's a wall over there.
<otakon> Spider
<mitamaking> prince-dari: you wouldn't even have angels if it wasn't for Moffat, you would have more Rose worship
<DalekKahn> Doctor who's dying says Dari
<otakon> and Epic Movie
<Sergio_Scriptor> I cant wait for the new doctor who season : )
<Reikim> Spider?
*pyrocatboy pokes dari
<prince-dari> It looks very inviting to my head.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nope
<DSNesmith> oh boy
<fluttercry> 05,15prince-dari because Steven Moffat hates Doctor Who obviously
<Sergio_Scriptor> so exited
<otakon> Spider's Web
<DocSane> Gotta run. Later, all'
<RAWRity> otakon: Spider's Web never got WMCd
<DSNesmith> SPIDER'S WEB
<SaxyPretender> 0,14only Babes and Epic Movie
<prince-dari> I'll just go and brain myself on it.
<otakon> TO THE LIST!
<FlutterMEDIC> bye DocSane
<Rookeealding> I was wondering I've never seen Doctor Who before, does anyone know if anyone will stream it?
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: touche
<DSNesmith> spider's web
<Reikim> Anyway, I doubt D-War will get WMC'd because the chat's going to have too much fun lambasting it.
<Sergio_Scriptor> I like steven moffat :'(
<DSNesmith> I missed spider's web, sadly
<RAWRity> technically, somebody could request Spider's Web and they'd ahve to show it at least once.
<mitamaking> Rookeealding: Go to Netflix
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat EQD link is exactly why we need Applejack song
<DSNesmith> oh yeah, D-War isn't WMC material
<Elit3xPon3> 2 livestreams, I CANT HANDLE IT
<Klumzeedragon> prince-dari: Noooo we love you!
<Sergio_Scriptor> he made goood episodes
<Vivix> There's someone here who streamed it a lot before, but dunno
<Meanwhile> Spiders Web was shit.
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: "Sadly"
<FlutterMEDIC> Rookeealding: we do, but its random
<JESmith> Dari's doing his fluttercry during Over The Edge impression
<DSNesmith> it's an absolutely shit movie, but its' hilariously so
<Vivix> Netflix is not available everywhere
<otakon> hell
<AlienWarhead> Are you guys talking about Doctor Who on BBC America?
<Yahooz> Indian fikkin Stallone
<Meanwhile> But not so shit it was WMC'd.
<Moopy> look its the buffer show guys
<Pale_Horse> Dat Indian Stallone...
<TWarTovlerWars> I'm going to watch this series despite never having seen Dr. Who
<otakon> Spider's Web isn't even ON the list
<JESmith> Er, Over The Hedge
<DSNesmith> lol
<DSNesmith> it was expunged
<Rookeealding> I meant the new ewpsode tommoreow night... and I don't have netflix
<Meanwhile> If I recall though, it /was/ WMC'd briefly, but was countermanded.
<otakon> that's how bad it was
<Rosfox> ping
<FlutterMEDIC> RAINBOW POWAH!
<Applejack2012> I havent seen any Dr. Who episodes
<DSNesmith> the best part
<DSNesmith> the guy who picked it
<mitamaking> Will they save the muffins?
<DSNesmith> didn't even watch it
<otakon> nvm

<Elit3xPon3> 5 minutes

<otakon> "It can be shown again"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he picked Epic Movie
<otakon> OH GOD WHY!?
<Moopy> MUFFINS!
<String_Shredder> So, guys, I was watching the older Doctor Who, and I have one question: Would you like a jelly baby?
<Applejack2012> yay!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and wasn't there
<RAWRity> you know, technically WMC only applies to official streams, right? So technically, a mod COULD stream Babes in Toyland on their own time if they wanted...
<Klumzeedragon> All the muffins!
<DSNesmith> literally, BIT was my #1 worst film
<Meanwhile> Babes in Toyland. A moment of silence for chatters lost.
<grayhoof> Shame I won't be bale to watch it, I wanna watch it with my dad so I have to wait for it on Comcast
<FlutterMEDIC> String_Shredder: the candy?
<fluttercry> 05,15I still don't know how the Nostalgia Critic could say Babes in Toyland wasn't that bad
<Moopy> heh i love you guys
<Klumzeedragon> Yeah Applejack! Woo hooooo!
<Meanwhile> Clearly he's an inbred backwater pigfucker.
<mitamaking> Clock is Ticking!!!
<Herostar> anypony play maplestory by chance?
<RAWRity> fluttercry: he said it was bad, but it was an entertaining type of bad for him.
<Austin> Moopy: we love you too :)
<Pale_Horse> Dose Infinite Depths...
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d5d8av3
<Vivix> My client colours my own chat, I feel like a fake mod

<String_Shredder> FlutterMEDIC: Yes, the candy. Would you like a jelly baby?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Will is best staff
<Moopy> thanks dude
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/pix/4385.png
<DSNesmith> it wasn't just shittily acted, it didn't just have shitty sets, it wasn't just boring as grass growing, it wasn't just filled with terrible musical numbers
<mitamaking> Herostar: GigabitHampster does, ask him about it
<DSNesmith> it was like THREE AND A HALF FUCKING HOURS LONG
<FlutterMEDIC> String_Shredder: yes
<Pale_Horse> Railing KilL!
<Yahooz> not enough railings
<fluttercry> 05,15I think it was a miniseries
<EspyLacopa> Pylons!
<DSNesmith> inexcuseable
<Moopy> fface planT!
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: so your standard Bollywood film?
<DSNesmith> bollywood is entertaining
<Sumica> 00,10okay, so bit of an option here.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Babes was torture
<DSNesmith> and "terrible" isn't how I'd describe the music
<fluttercry> 05,15Endhiran
<DSNesmith> "hilarious", more like
<fluttercry> 05,15totally worth the length
<Sumica> 00,10next movie we have a rifftrax option for.

<twilight_sprinkle> actually without is leading 7-4 i think
<DSNesmith> lol dean
<AlienWarhead> Rosfox Commentary by the MST3K guys
<Everlasting_Joy> Rosfox: A commentary, especially one designed to point out the flaws for comedy's sake.
<Rookeealding> no I wont' be here tomoorw

<Obsidian> Wrek: ............
<DSNesmith> every time the protagonist changes his facial expression, take a shot
<SaxyPretender> 0,14man, all the dirty jokes that could be made with D
<Meanwhile> Ghosties: No "Long ago in a distant land" ?
<RosePetal> Dragon Wars! So this will be a ripoff of Star Wars.
<BronyInstrumental> Wrek: i can't view it, i'm too young apparently ;_;
<otakon> Damn, in media res much?
<Obsidian> That is all
<MrBen> WAIT, I KNOW. It sounded similar to Zecroa. Only not.

<DSNesmith> wait, no
<Barbetos> I already hate this
<Herostar> crazy hobo, fantastic
<RAWRity> Derp Wars
<DSNesmith> every scene he appears in
<DalekKahn> We should watch the Animated Dragonlance movie
<twilight_sprinkle> Dragons are just a myth!
<Reikim> Warning: I'm probably going to enjoy this movie in a cheesy sort of way.
<DSNesmith> and has this expression
<Bloxx> is he a pirate?
<Yahooz> WMC number 3 might be here before us
<DSNesmith> take a shot
<Austin> D-War? wow

<Ghosties> 04"I'm a generic Native American that's speaking crazy talk! Listen to me!"
<Sweet_Tea> im just gonna be loli ng through this whole movie XD
<Barbetos> I am hating it more
<Kandarihu> RosePetal, because it has the word "Wars" in the title?
<desertman2> looking good already
<Jigglysaint> more like D-bag wars
<otakon> Ghosties: lol
<SpeedyBolt> Apperantly so.
<prince-dari> Looking promising
<Elit3xPon3> err mah gerrd
<Barbetos> The hate levels!
<FlutterMEDIC> hammyness within the first minute of the movie...this is going to be a long movie
<Sweet_Tea> DEY HAVE AWOKEN
<RosePetal> Was just assuming.
<otakon> Ghosties: I nearly spit out my coffee at that line
<twilight_sprinkle> doh
<DSNesmith> "I forgot which order my lines go in"
<Yahooz> Its so bad, Ghosties has resorted to making jokes about it to give it hope
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: it IS a long one
<JESmith> From the title it sounded like an anime
<OohShiny> dat acting
<RosePetal> You don't have a tie! So YOU CAN'T BE HERE!
<DSNesmith> seriously this guy's face
<DSNesmith> is made of wood
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: OH GOD NO
<twilight_sprinkle> and then he absorbed a soul

*pyrocatboy turns off his brain
<Reikim> Wow, that security is incompetent.
<DSNesmith> this guy's face is made of wood
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> scale
<Ghosties> 04I like how they have the one token Native American there so that they can convey how bad digging up things are
<AlienWarhead> Why did we not want Rifftrax here?
<RosePetal> Who could have caused this?
<otakon> dragon scale
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: he's almost as good as the guy i Birdemic
<JESmith> otakon: I know that know
<otakon> AlienWarhead: bc
<fluttercry> 05,15He's covered wars you know?
<DSNesmith> oh god

<otakon> WHY DID WE NOT START HERE!
<Ghosties> 04Frank West is 20 times the man he is
<Vivix> He's not ugly though
<RosePetal> 15 years later.
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: just say the 2nd act
<fluttercry> 05,15Wait....this really is a flashback...2 minutes into the film?
<FlutterMEDIC> you know what we need? the Nostalgia Critic to critic this movie
<DSNesmith> oh yeah
<RosePetal> Ethan.

<DSNesmith> just wait till we meet the female lead
<Alchemist> erm, where is this guy familiar from?
<Midnight_Fyre> Is this worse than Reign of fire? Because that would be quite a feat
<RAWRity> more flashbacks than Naruto
<DSNesmith> I've seen more convincing pornstars

<FlutterMEDIC> dat box
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh look, "Pawn Stars."

<Barbetos> 1507?
<mitamaking> 485 years ago
<Deadlypon3> That's right, just SHOVE all that mythology in the first five minutes. Not like we have a whole MOVIE to just slowly dish it out
<SpeedyBolt> Special effects.
<Bjornfot> Wait, is this really the story?
<otakon> A FLASHBACK WITHIN A FLASHBACK
<AJIsAwesome> Sounds like a bad Okami parody......
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I HERD U LIEK FLASHBACKS
<otakon> THE FUCK
<Barbetos> So this movie was made in 2007
<MrBen> Everlasting_Joy: Thank you. Now you got me thinking of the Weegee stare.

<GigabitHarmonie> BronyInstrumental: Tomorrow night, think Saturday. :)
<fluttercry> 05,15So I herd u liek flashbacks

<RosePetal> Flashback within a Flashback Within a Flashback/
<SpeedyBolt> Flashback in a Flashback

<otakon> I told you
<Spazturtle> Is it just me or is the stream laggy?
<OohShiny> CHING CHONG!
<Ghosties> 04HARRO?

<Deadlypon3> Ninjangos?!
<RosePetal> He's ded but smiling.
<OohShiny> ching chong!
<Barbetos> Ah forget it!
<FlutterMEDIC> Poot better actors here!
<TWarTovlerWars> First Baracki trips the CMCs, now this
<AlienWarhead> A ninja did it
<Pale_Horse> I think there is a law that says you can;t have flaskback inside of flashbacks. I think they put you in a sack and beat you with reeds if you break it. :(
<otakon> where is the subs?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03 You just have to assume that they are talking like they are in despair!
<Sumica> 00,10odd
<BronyInstrumental> GigabitHarmonie: okay then, thanks. i might be able to catch it then, seeing as school starts for me in a few days and, as much as i hate to say it, i need to actually pay attention in classes, so no 5AM-bedtime nights for me ;_;
<RosePetal> Did he say Kim?
<Wrek> 05so much hate on my new image
<Sumica> 00,10subs, why you no load

<DSNesmith> perhaps it's the borderline porn
<killerpony7733> Wrek people have no open mind
<Ghosties> 04I bring you your daily tribute of M&Ms, grand leader
<Dr_Fumbles> What is this about?
<fluttercry> 05,15Wrek which one?
<TWarTovlerWars> My lord, please listen
<Meanwhile> Wrek: Because people are crybabies, you did a good job.
<Reikim> I'm not even following the plot anymore, and I managed to struggle through RahXephon! (Granted, RahXephon actually played fair.)
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: The Cherrilee one?
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Wrek: Wat image?
<prince-dari> One in every 5 words of what he's saying I understand
<SpeedyBolt> Okay, seriously
<Wrek> 051 sec otakon ill link you

<Obsidian> otakon: DOnt do it
<Midnight_Fyre> RosePetal: Maybe. The name Kim is like Smith in the US
<SpeedyBolt> Subtitles?
<TWarTovlerWars> she will be sacrificed to the imoogi
<BronyInstrumental> Wrek: i can't view your new image i'm "too young" ;_;
<FlutterMEDIC> i really want to say Ching Chong, but i dont know if you guys will allow it

<DalekKahn> BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH
<RosePetal> There are yen ben da ko mo cma.

<DSNesmith> otakon I wouldn't go through that link
<Yahooz> No subtitles?
<Ghosties> 04IS HARRO
<wirisme1989> this is useful
<SpeedyBolt> CHING CHONG
<DSNesmith> it's furry porn
<otakon> Also, the film would have been better if it started with the FLASHBACK first THEN fast forwarded to present day
<OohShiny> damn, he's high
<SpeedyBolt> There I said it.
<Sumica> 00,10......hold on. I need to stop this
<Meanwhile> otakon you are about to see crotchboobs if he links you the nsfw version.
<otakon> also, WHERE ARE THE SUBS?
<Pale_Horse> Hmm. maybe I should start a new Korea game in Civilization 5. :P
<FlutterMEDIC> CHING CHONG CHING
<Vivix> mica
<StrayPony> Look subtitles cost money, this film cant afford it
<DalekKahn> Mice
<OohShiny> old guy is high
<Ghosties> 04I dunno, it's funnier this way
<Reikim> What the fuck just happened in manechat.
<Dr_Fumbles> Ummm....

<FlutterMEDIC> damn buffer
<RosePetal> So the film is lazy. They can't even afford subtitles.
<Kandarihu> Buffer
<desertman2> Maybe it's better if we don't know what they're saying
<Rosfox> OH MAI BUFFER
<SpeedyBolt> Buffer
<Randomnerd> NO CROTCHBOOBS! DX

<pony_4379> They're discussing what's for dinner.
<XaviortheSavior> adding subtitles, sumi?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03 Wrek: You needed a blue box -_-
<Pale_Horse> They are totally speaking Ranicorn. :D
<RosePetal> Even the Buffer can not take it.
<Bloxx> They're probably just speaking gibberish and hoping it sounds like Korean
<Obsidian> dat buffer
<AJIsAwesome> Someone screen capture this!!!!
<TWarTovlerWars> The entire movie's plot is being explained right now. Problem?
<Reikim> I'm assuming what just happened, happened in manechat, because God knows it didn't happen here.
<Elit3xPon3> back
<fluttercry> 05,15harro
<SpeedyBolt> It is?
<MrBen> I think Sumica stopped the stream...
<pyrocatboy> I bet they are actually talking about women.
<Yahooz> roughly translated to ""The Secret of Bronystate Gold MUST NOT BE REVEALED"
<BronyInstrumental> GigabitHarmonie: technically for me, your show IS today. just in about 20 hours :)
<SpeedyBolt> Because I am so fucking confused right now.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Don't know Korean, well TOO BAD.
<Rookeealding> so he's telling this kid this in another languate..
<prince-dari> Are we supposed to know what they're talking about

<SaxyPretender> 0,14the fuck's with all the harro and ching chong shit?
<Ryunosuke> prince-dari, I think it would help
<Elit3xPon3> OH NOES the movie froze for me D;
<Deadlypon3> G-Get it? ADVENTURE TIME :D!
<RosePetal> Yeah, but we need subs SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE PLOT.
<Pale_Horse> We need to call Jake from Adventure Time in. :P
<GigabitHarmonie> BronyInstrumental: Exactly! :)
<AlienWarhead> Maybe if we cut Korea in half we can understand them better
<Ghosties> 04<Yahooz> roughly translated to ""The Secret of Bronystate Gold MUST NOT BE REVEALED" <-- Inside the box was the first ever BronyState Gold membership card
<DSNesmith> this movie is apparently starring my physics professor
<MrBen> Everlasting_Joy: Agreed.
<AJIsAwesome> Quick, someone screencap this!
<fluttercry> 05,15Racists....on my internet?
<NullRadix> um
<SuperBrony64> 11,02We watching Pokemon?
<RosePetal> Really?
<Barbetos> There is not subs becuase it was never translated. They could not decipher jive.
<Yahooz> Ghosties: Now the movie makes sense. Your welcome
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties how do I get a gold membership!?
<Randomnerd> I don't want to say it's racist, but... Racist.
<DSNesmith> oh you haven't seen racist yet
<Ghosties> 04You must defeat dragons
<Marx> SuperBrony64, Maybe.
<DSNesmith> wait till we get to the token black guy
<Pale_Horse> I want a gold membership.
<FlutterMEDIC> why does the guy look like he's making a kissy face? D:
<mitamaking> I better see this in the buffer collection
<Bjornfot> What link? What crotchboobs?
<RosePetal> No, no pokemon but dragons. And flashbacks. Apparently lots of dragons.
<Reikim> Chat's been way more racist before.
*Randomnerd has his hair up and huge.
<Yahooz> With bad Cinematics
<otakon> Ghosties: I'm the Dovahkiin, easy peasy
<Elit3xPon3> damn ads
<RosePetal> He's attempting Duck Face. It failed.
<Marx> SuperBrony64, Pokemon has dragons. Maybe we'll see a Dragonite?
<Yahooz> and MiPs freaks out
<Ghosties> 04You gotta be
<Yahooz> dammit
<DSNesmith> wrek drew some clop pic of cheerilee

<Ryunosuke>  shout buffers!
<TWarTovlerWars> The Rifftrax copy has subtites. are we switching to that one?
*Midnight_Fyre just looked up Wrek's new drawing 6_9
<SpeedyBolt> To catch them is my real test
<DSNesmith> lol
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Wrek, dat picture
<Randomnerd> Do I want to go back to "A Dance With Dragons"?
<FlutterMEDIC> To train them is my cause
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<Reikim> Same here, RAWRity.
<Everlasting_Joy> You know what this movie is missing? Mulan music.
<RosePetal> To train them is my cause.
<DSNesmith> urgh
<SpeedyBolt> To train them is my-
<otakon> RAWRity: Sumica is doing somthing with it
<DSNesmith> I can't get through ADWD
<AlienWarhead> all I have is buffering
<FlutterMEDIC> beat ya
<SpeedyBolt> ...I give up.
<XaviortheSavior> I'm assuming Sumica paused the video so he could add subtitles.
<Randomnerd> I'm 200 pages from the end.
<Ryunosuke> dunno how i did that
<DSNesmith> it's so boring
<RAWRity> otakon: shhhhhhh
<MrBen> Everlasting_Joy: Again, agreed.
<otakon> Sumica: what's the situation if you do not mind
<DSNesmith> what happened
<RosePetal> I will travel across the land searching far and wide.
<Randomnerd> DSNesmith: I was told to skip it.
<otakon> Okay

<SpeedyBolt> GOTTA CATCH EM ALL
<Reikim> Great, gonna have to deal with shit in manechat just to know what's going on.
<FlutterMEDIC> all i see is ponies watching a buffering screen of a kissy faced old man
<Randomnerd> DSNesmith: I'm worried it'll get worse.
<DSNesmith> yeah
<RosePetal> POKEMON GOTTA CATCH THEM ALL.
<fluttercry> 05,15Wrek if people are complaining about that picture that's stupid, it's not that bad

<FlutterMEDIC> @Ghosties: THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
<SpeedyBolt> I might as well go listen to some more Battle Network music.
<Reikim> Anyway: otakon, link.
<RosePetal> Let's get down to business to defeat the Dragons.
<pyrocatboy> AJIsAwesome http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9nda0Mw4c1ru3r25o1_500.png

<DSNesmith> AFFC was terrible
<AlienWarhead> Ghosties he did in Chinese
<JESmith> Rifftrax now?
<Elit3xPon3> is the movie playing for you guys?
<Ghosties> 04No, I know
<AdamTheDuck> Is this just fantasy?
<MrBen> Ghosties: Didn't he do that in the Chinese version?
<Yahooz> Howabout the cast of LotR sings call me maybe?
*PillowPoni|Minecraft goes to listen to Anamanaguchi
<fluttercry> 05,15Ghosties he did
<DSNesmith> new characters nobody cared about every other chapter
<FlutterMEDIC> nice pyrocatboy
<Randomnerd> I liked the first three best, too.
<Ghosties> 04I want Jackie Chan to interrupt harro and this other guy and sing
<TWarTovlerWars> The subtitled parts are short, but the ENTIRE plot of the movie is explained in it, so yeah -_-
<RosePetal> Still buffering?
<AJIsAwesome> pyrocatboy: Thank you.:D
<DSNesmith> sam dicking around on a boat
<Midnight_Fyre> OK, who wants to see the product of months of work?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02"If you build it...they will complain..." -God, day Internet was thought up.
<DSNesmith> it read like a bad travelogue
<Randomnerd> I can only speak in vauge terms, for the benefit of others.
<MrBen> Rose: Yep.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Midnight_Fyre: I do, if it's okay with you
<AdamTheDuck> Caught in a landslide
<RosePetal> lol Miracles can happen.
<Randomnerd> I feel so bad for Sam.
<DSNesmith> also "the fat greasy guy gets laid, so my fans can too"
<Alchemist> goddamit, I just realised its september now
<Reikim> I've only read the first book. I liked it.
<DSNesmith> I hate what he's done with Sam
<DSNesmith> or rather, not done
<DSNesmith> it's been like 2000 goddamn pages
<fluttercry> 05,15Because people don't read....Sumica needed to stop the film so he could get subtitles working...now calm yourselves.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/Jaw1w.jpg
<SuperBrony64> 11,02+moo?
<DSNesmith> and he has had no character development at all
<Randomnerd> Sam has not grown up yet.
<Ghosties> 04Calm your nips
<DSNesmith> same with Sansa
<AdamTheDuck> Moo
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when http://i.imgur.com/Jaw1w.jpg
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Where was Gondor when this movie needs subtitles?
<Iain> school is starting that gives me less time with everypony!!!
<Yahooz> CALM YO TITIES
<otakon> fluttercry: I figured as much
<Barbetos> panic!!
<Kurra> Ghosties, now there's a non-issue. :D
<RosePetal> Sorry. You did not say this.
<EspyLacopa> In the beginning, God made the universe. This made a lot of people very angry and was widely regarded as a Bad Move.
<DSNesmith> Sansa had a clear-cut arc
<Reikim> Hey DSNesmith, read Wheel of Time, then complain about your characters doing shit all.
<Ryunosuke> Ghosties, my nips ar hard
<MrBen> Fluttercry: Ahhhh.
<otakon> Iain: CALM.YOUR.TITS!
<TWarTovlerWars> Its japs, not nips
<Spazturtle> Where are the old mods like RainBroDash and DCD?
<FlutterMEDIC> BRILLIANT MEANWHILE!
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: :D I'm laughing so hard.
<Kurra> or is it the real life AdamtheDuck?
<DSNesmith> starts as naive girl, is forced to grow up too fast to survive in the world of dirty politics
<RosePetal> Thus the Nostalgia Critic was born.
<DSNesmith> instead
<SpeedyBolt> Are we all still buffering?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> it not September here on the East Coast for another 2.5 hours
<MrBen> So THAT'S why the film stopped.
<Randomnerd> Sansa is really frustrating. I hate fans that like to watch her suffer, though.
<DSNesmith> she has developed almost none at all
<Meanwhile> Spazturtle: Gone.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Goddammit Meanwhile. I'm calling Hax
<SpeedyBolt> I dont get it
<Klumzeedragon> HARRO BUFFER, I like that. :D
<AlienWarhead> Meanwhile wow you guys are fast
<Elit3xPon3> oh
<otakon> Spazturtle: well Rainbro and DCD don't come on that often anymore
<FlutterMEDIC> Meanwhile: BRILLIANT!
<RosePetal> The film stopped or something.
<DSNesmith> and is still the same person she was in book one
<RAWRity> That's why I stick to simpler titles for my fantasy reading. Like HPATHBP and TWWRLAM and PJATBOTL and TSA:AHTOCT
<SpeedyBolt> I'm lost my head hurts
<Vivix> Luna used to stream cartoons, I miss her streams
<AdamTheDuck> Open your eyes
<otakon> Vivix: me too man
<Spazturtle> :(
<AdamTheDuck> Look up to the skies and seeee
<MrBen> Not gonna be September here for at least another 3 and a half hours over here!
<Iain> lol oktakon
<Ghosties> 04Awesome Meanwhile

<Randomnerd> "Hahaha, she's so dumb". SHE HAS NO AGENCY BECAUSE OF HER SEX.
<Yahooz> This aint MeowCeption. We got some real technical problems
<RAWRity> ps, if you get all of those titles, you win a cookie.
<otakon> THE MOVIE WILL BE STREAMED!
*SpeedyBolt relaxes
<RosePetal> Ok then.

<RosePetal> Sumica is putting subtitles.
<Yahooz> well, not technical, but you know what i mean
*PillowPoni|Minecraft blasts Anamanaguchi to the entire chat
<Reikim> She is the very epitome of an airhead.
<DSNesmith> but she continued to be useless
<Rookeealding> So... Hows the rumor mill lately? Have there been any good ones?
<MrBen> ....so! Why don't we play Charades to pass the...oh, wait. Damn.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Yeah, telling the masses that'll really help.

<DSNesmith> if you need to talk
<Kandarihu> Alright. Cats are fed.
<otakon> I've only finished the first book
<RosePetal> SUMERPAN.
<Randomnerd> Reikim: She's there for deconstruction of the tropes.
<Dr_Fumbles> Hold on, Sumica just needs to learn the language and translate for us
<Iain> look up waiting music on http://www.youtube.com
<RosePetal> Ok.
<Meanwhile> FlutterMEDIC: http://i.imgur.com/0Hmgi.jpg did that too.
<SpeedyBolt> If we're streaming on Halloween, seriously
<Reikim> There is no way that Storm of Swords can possibly make me suffer.
<Spazturtle> inb4 +m
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: i swear hes got images binded to every key
<AlienWarhead> I meant everywhere not just Bronystate

<DSNesmith> well
<Rookeealding> It should be 24 hours of Nightmare night
<Midnight_Fyre> FlutterMEDIC: Yes, it took me months to carve (since it was my first time ever carving stone) and I just finished today. Here's a pic of the side, where the stone looks really good: http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/6093/img7730b.jpg
<DSNesmith> all I can say is
<RAWRity> otakon: likely because they're not Game of Thrones books.
<RosePetal> Waits patienly.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/hJ6Ix.jpg
<Tassadork> omg meanwhile has an archive of all the big buffers
<DSNesmith> hope you like weddings
<Reikim> I have read some fucked-up shit, my friends.

<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/3ydTy.jpg
<DSNesmith> and they're all so happy
<RosePetal> lol
<RAWRity> they're A Song of Ice and Fire books.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/8sm8P.jpg
<Reikim> Yeah, they're not.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> inb4 Meanwhile gets kicked for link spamming
<Yahooz> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54493344/Ferris%20imgur.png

<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/T303F.jpg
<Kandarihu> How about something that can only scare bronies. Let's just stream the Live Shows
<Elit3xPon3> im scared to click the links
<Meanwhile> I could go on.
<fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile you going to make one for the asian guy?
<DSNesmith> just saying
<Brad__> Midnight_Fyre, what material is that?
<RosePetal> I remember that day we watched Clone Wars and it kept buffering.
<Marx> ALL the buffers!
<DSNesmith> if you need to vent after finishing the book
<otakon> isn't Game of THrones the first in the Song of Fire and Ice series?
<Dark92Enigma> Is the stream working for you'
<Dark92Enigma> '
<DSNesmith> yes, otakon
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: http://i.imgur.com/Jaw1w.jpg
<MrBen> fluttercry: I think he already did
<otakon> THEN YOU KNEW WHAT I MEANT
<Randomnerd> DSNesmith: Don't say too much.
<Midnight_Fyre> Brad_: Alabaster stone
<Kandarihu> RosePetal, ah yeah
<FlutterMEDIC> http://i.imgur.com/hINFO.gif
<otakon> even though I typed it wrong
<Yahooz> I remember we made a bunch for Ferris Bueller alone
<Rookeealding> That was fast
<desertman2> that was fast
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> fluttercry: It's already been done
<RAWRity> otakon: yes, but that's like saying Deathly Hallows was a Philosopher's Stone book
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6i3daCRJc1rnubimo1_500.jpg
<Meanwhile> This isn't even my final form.
<Reikim> There is literally no way it can make me angry enough to vent.
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<FlutterMEDIC> http://i.imgur.com/hINFO.gif
<Dark92Enigma> Is the stream working for you guys?
<Iain> meanwhile at home *a crazy party is going on*
<RosePetal> This is not my true form.
<RosePetal> No.
<Reikim> Maybe laugh a bit./
<TWarTovlerWars> Buffuh Ganghan style
<DSNesmith> when I read "the band started playing the rains of castamere" I nearly stopped reading right there and left the book
<SpeedyBolt> nope.
<Rookeealding> They gotta find Twlight to hatch that Dragon egg
<LoGaN> no stream?
<MrBen> Meanwhile: ...do we even want to see it?
<Yahooz> Oppa Buffah Styuh
<DSNesmith> I was like "aw hell naw, he's not"
<XaviortheSavior> stream is paused. Mod's fixin something
<Vivix> Midnight_Fyre, stone carving? Nice-
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> TWarTovlerWars: Heeeeeeey, sexy bufferrr~
<Dark92Enigma> No stream <---------------- Help
<Meanwhile> MrBen: http://i.imgur.com/00vkQ.jpg
<RosePetal> Rainbow Dash is bad ass.
<otakon> RAWRity: well dammit everyone calls it game of thrones and I thought that was what the book series was called
<Wrek> 05fun part is
<Iain> meanwhile in 2-fort
<Brad__> Midnight_Fyre, that must have taken some time to get to that point. I don't know if you saw this earlier, but I did this out of abs plastic: http://i.imgur.com/Uozn8.jpg
<Wrek> 05my dad read my DA
<Reikim> Now I'm confused about what to expect from that book now.
<DSNesmith> the tv series is called GoT
<Wrek> 05reads*
<DSNesmith> just read it
<RAWRity> nope. Just the HBO miniseries
<DSNesmith> it's good
<Ghosties> 04Harro is completely silenced by the magical spinning circle
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: How did that turn out?
<Eli> FlutterMEDIC: who's the guy batting the buffer?
<RosePetal> Whoa, ponies made out off ood.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Wrek: Is that good or bad thing?
<MrBen> Meanwhile: ...THATS your true form?
<DSNesmith> I haven't seen much of season 2 of the series
<Wrek> 05good thing i tagged the NSFW as strict.
<DSNesmith> is it as good as the first?
<Meanwhile> I bet that's a fun experience Wrek.
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<Wrek> 05the questionable one wont botehr him as much
<Tassadork> Brad__: are those printed?
<FlutterMEDIC> Eli:...David Tennant
<Meanwhile> MrBen: Actually that's just more buffering.
<SpeedyBolt> Nice going, Wrek.
<Brad__> Tassadork, yes
<Iain> meanwhile in tf2 brony server *putis spencer here
<Reikim> If it's stupid then I won't care. If it tries to gut-punch me, well, I've been gut-punched enough to not care.
<DSNesmith> I was kind of pissed at them showing Stannis screwing Melisandre
<MrBen> Meanwhile: lol
<Midnight_Fyre> Brad_: I didn't see that before. Nice work
<Ghosties> 04"It...it must be...the Buffer Dragon D:"
<Vivix> Wrek Well, It's a really nice image, but even so you don't show your parents that kinda stuff
<DSNesmith> it was much more effective when it was just implied
<Dark92Enigma> So who's stream is WORKING?
<Brad__> Midnight_Fyre, thanks :)
<RosePetal> Not me.
<Kandarihu> TWarTovlerWars, HEEEEEEY! SEXY CIRCLE!
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: if you like vagina monsters and constant sex scenes, sure.
<Tassadork> Brad__: so awesome. makes me want a 3d printer even more
<Bjornfot> oh Wrek you so silly~ But I'm proud you draw clop.
<Meanwhile> Find me a picture of a dragon Ghosties and I will make it happen.
<Eli> FlutterMEDIC: i knew it! it's so pixeld, i just wanted to be sure
<DSNesmith> .... vagina monsters?
<Vivix> "You are doing WHAT with ponies!?"
<otakon> Ghosties: it's the Ouroboros
<DSNesmith> is that the shadow baby?
<Reikim> DSNesmith: You should realize by now that the GoT show is 50% sex appeal.
<RAWRity> yesh
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Well you worked hard on it for the monies.
<DSNesmith> also fuck Ros
<Rookeealding> How bout we show Dragon Quest until D-wars is ready
<otakon> THE BUFFER CIRCLE IS THE OUROBOROS!
<Brad__> Tassadork, Im going to make some more in different scales and give them to anyone that might want one.
<RosePetal> Oh noes Buffer Dragon. Were doomed.
<otakon> THE END IS NEAR!
<cachi01|phone> hey guys guess what
<DSNesmith> she adds nothing
<Brad__> keep em white so you can paint them if you want.
<RosePetal> NEIGH!
<DSNesmith> I did like what they did with Theon though
<Midnight_Fyre> Vivix: Thanks. Here is the front again: http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/9027/img7727a.jpg
<Dark92Enigma> Uhhhhh.......are you guys getting the same buffer as me?
<otakon> Reikim: yeah
<Iain> meanwhile in equestria *dear princess celestia...*
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Wrek: Your parents don't seem to mind it so it can't be that bad.....
<TWarTovlerWars> Bu Bu Buff Buffa Gangnam style
<FlutterMEDIC> Everyday I'm buffering! http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24797891.jpg
<SpeedyBolt> I think I am
<otakon> but it's still not bad
<Dr_Fumbles> Someday, I just know that circle is going to spin the other way...
<DSNesmith> he's less of a complete dick in the miniseries
<cachi01|phone> I <3 pokemon crystal :)
<Reikim> The actors in the GoT TV show are paid to stand around shirtless. THAT IS ALL.
<RAWRity> GoT has mastered what I like to call "Sexposition" they have exposition of important plot points smack dab in the middle of the sex scenes.
<desertman2> *yawn* Right now, I don't mind if we need to go on without subs
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark92Enigma: Yeah, but there's a reason for it.
<otakon> and it's a fairly faithful adpatation
<Spazturtle> wrek link to da?
*MrBen dances.
<Vivix> Dark92Enigma, yeah it's down while they fix subs
<otakon> Reikim: even the dwarf
<alfopony> buffer circle y u no show movie
<FlutterMEDIC> http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24797891.jpg
<SpeedyBolt> Staring at the circle long enough will get you high
<DSNesmith> he actually goes to his dad to get help for Robb, instead of intending to betray him the entire time
<pony_6732> RBY <3
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> TWarTovlerWars: Heeeeeey, sexy buffer~ (Sorry, had to do it)
<Yahooz> ayyyyyyyyyy sessy streamer
<XaviortheSavior> Dark92Enigma whole stream is paused. Mod had technical difficulties i think
<Reikim> RAWRity: You get a /) because I am so using that term from now on.
<Yahooz> op op op oppa buffah styuh
<Rookeealding> Muffins
<Dark92Enigma> Everlasting_Joy: oh i get it
<Crippler> The gods are angry at us. A SACRIFICE MUST BE MADE!
<RosePetal> Still buffering.
<Midnight_Fyre> After months of work I've finally finished her: http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/9027/img7727a.jpg
<DSNesmith> so, uh, did the stream commit suicide?
<Obsidian> For thosee who want to know. Wrek's DA name is Wreky
<otakon> RAWRity: I bet that's a real thing
<alfopony> oppa buffer style
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Crippler: Bring forth the virgins!
<RosePetal> I Sacrifice this COOKIE!
<Iain> shhhhhh rainbow dash is looking at us funny :O
*cachi01|phone sacrifices Crippler
*fluttercry sacrifices Crippler
<DSNesmith> is that soap
<otakon> DSNesmith: no Sumica is finding subs
<AlienWarhead> ;)
<Dark92Enigma> So...............anypony watched DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS? Yatatatatatatatatata
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/pix/4626.gif
<Reikim> That...
<Kandarihu> I Buffer and I know it!
<Reikim> is beautiful.
<otakon> it's alabaster
<DSNesmith> ooh
<MrBen> I suppose now would be a good time to go get something to eat, but knowing my luck the movie will come back on just as I walk out of the room.
<DSNesmith> fanceh
<Rookeealding> quick name every Dragon movie you can think of
<Midnight_Fyre> It's Pinkamena in alabaster stone
<cachi01|phone> fluttercry jeje first
<RosePetal> Derpy stop. You make this work.
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: good job man, it's a little lobsided to be honest be well damn done.
<Vivix> Midnight_Fyre, nice, I've never carved anything but plaster- it looks very retro, like 80s house decor
<SpeedyBolt> I want to get something to drink.
<RosePetal> HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.
<Rookeealding> Great time for the add though
<SpeedyBolt> My mouth is dying
<Dark92Enigma> DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS Ya.tatatatatatata
<Iain> everyday I'm bufferin'
<Everlasting_Joy> Azuredragon: It the Engenieer if Derpy took his position for the day.
<Ryunosuke> does dungeons and dragons count?
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Ooh, sacrifices. Wish Tzekel Khan was here to see this?
<Elit3xPon3> no ads!
<RosePetal> Eyeup.
<TWarTovlerWars> ERAGON
<otakon> Ryunosuke: no, and that's a WMC if I ever saw one
<Klumzeedragon> We need Woona and her Cartographers Hat to repair the buffer machine!
<AJIsAwesome> Can someone call THE REPAIR MARE MARE MARE MARE?
<BonyHepSits> Is it working yet?
<Yahooz> Puff the Magic Dragon > DWars :p
<otakon> the ONLY good dragon movie is DRAGONHEART
<Dark92Enigma> Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
<Rookeealding> be it title or actually in the movie
<richfiles> Is stream alive or dead. Just got here, Every day I'm bufferin' :$
<RosePetal> Lol I remeber Tzekel. Crazy dude.
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: thanks. it was my first time working in stone, so I think I need a bit of practice, but I'm satisfied
<otakon> DRAGONHEART IS BEST DRAGON MOVIE!
<Kandarihu> Mmm, guys look at this circle! M, guys look at this circle! Mmm, guys look at this circle! ...it won't start!
<DSNesmith> buff-buff-buffah
<Marx> Azuredragon, There there Derpy. Leave the wrench-banging to Applejack.
<Reikim> But Sexposition. Perfect term. I am adding it to my list of commonly-used terms.
<desertman2> I was gonna post Dragonheart
<CrimsonPhoenix> so I managed to watched a full ep of Gamegrumps before Sumica came back?
<Dark92Enigma> OVERACTING vs UNDERACTING
<Spazturtle> The mods are finidning the subs
<otakon> RAWRity: copyright it
<RosePetal> Sumica is trying to find Subs so we can understand the movie.
<Randomnerd> Yeah, it's pretty smart.
<DSNesmith> anyone else hate youtube's new "we won't buffer unless you're playing" thing
<cachi01|phone> otakob Eeyup
<Reikim> It is going right there among all the tropes I use.
<otakon> RAWRity: send it to TVtropes
<Klumzeedragon> COWARD KILLING TIME!
<CrimsonPhoenix> don't know what to say
<Iain> derp medic
<Midnight_Fyre> The pic doesn't really do the stone justice
<pony_6732> he's translating it right now
<Reikim> DSNesmith: So, so much.
<RosePetal> Ok.
<Randomnerd> DSNesmith: Yes.
<otakon> DSNesmith: oh utter stupidity
<AlienWarhead> richfiles steam is buffering so Sumica can find subtitles
<TWarTovlerWars> Dragon Sean Connery is one of those, your argument is invalid things
<Reikim> Sexposition.
<Obsidian> I'm watching the Bad Movie Beatdown of this while I'm waiting
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal Oh, so it's in japanese
<DSNesmith> it's probably revenge for all the people using adblocker
<CrimsonPhoenix> inb4nosubs
<RosePetal> It's Korean.
<Vivix> Korean flashback, rest english
<Iain> MEDIC!,MEEDIC!,DOCTOR!!
<Reikim> Hey, does D-War have a sexposition scene?
<Rookeealding> someone can just type it up for us.
<Ryunosuke> does godzilla count as a dragon?
<Randomnerd> DSNesmith: Well, maybe if the ads weren't shite.
<DSNesmith> no
<RosePetal> Well at least that's what I'm getting.
<DSNesmith> no sex
<DSNesmith> in fact
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> RosePetal: That's how you spell the first part of his name. Sweet. He's awesome
<Reikim> Dammit
<richfiles> Ah... That explains things. Like I said... Just got here. I was SOOOO busy today. Made $280 in scrap from crap in my garage! :O
<DSNesmith> SPOILER ALERT
<DSNesmith> .
<DSNesmith> the LI dies int he end
<Reikim> We don't care, spoilers now.
<Reikim> Oh
<Reikim> What is the LI?
<Dark92Enigma> Anypony watched DUNGEONS and DRAGONS?.........
<DSNesmith> love interest
<CrimsonPhoenix> richfiles, garage slaes?
<Randomnerd> Love interest.
<Reikim> Ahaha
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Ryunosuke: He breathes fire, doesn't he?
<Klumzeedragon> Ryunosuke: No... he counts as Godzilla! :P
<Vivix> had it on VHS ages ago, never saw it
<RosePetal> lol saw the Nostalgia Critics review of it.
<richfiles> THe live action movie with Wesley Crusher???
<Reikim> Is the romance as wooden as the protag's face?
<Randomnerd> Sex?! It's a movie about DAGRONS
<DSNesmith> she gives her soul to the good snake
<Iain> guys it looks like AJ is about to buk us
<Ryunosuke> Dark92Enigma, goood, let me feed off your anger and hate :)
<Randomnerd> Spike.
<AlienWarhead> Dark92Enigma Satan's game?
<DSNesmith> and it turns into a dragon
<richfiles> Nope... Cleared out excess scrap metal from my shop.
<MrBen> Dark92Enigma: Depends. Are you talking about the animated series?
<RosePetal> Prolfion and Blue lipped man.
<fluttercry> 05,15Isn't a ton of Game of Thrones exposition told through sex?
<Klumzeedragon> Dark92Enigma: I believe I OWN that movie. :D
<Dark92Enigma> I watched near 2007.............then i saw the review 2 years later
<DSNesmith> an actual chinese-looking dragon, so props for that
<RAWRity> while we're waiting for subs, have this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pupTowgpVVo
<Randomnerd> It's a movie about Spike fighting the other Dagrons.
<Randomnerd> fluttercry: Yes.
<TWarTovlerWars> I've heard of D-War through Rifftrax
<Elit3xPon3> can anyone join the silent theatre? its so lonely there...
<RAWRity> fluttercry: yes, thus why we have the term sexposition now
<CrimsonPhoenix> richfiles, well I guess you fit your name correctly
<Randomnerd> In the show, anyway.
<RosePetal> Rifftrax did this?
<Dark92Enigma> MrBen: The Movie
<DSNesmith> in the book the sex scenes are still there
<CrimsonPhoenix> You got rich....from files
<Reikim> fluttercry: Less than the TV Series would make you believe, but a good chunk of the book's plot is about who exactly is banging who.
<Randomnerd> You get to see Alfie Allen's schlong.
<MrBen> Dark92Enigma: Though to answer your question....no. No, neither the movie nor the series.
<AlienWarhead> Elit3xPon3 what?
<CrimsonPhoenix> HURR DURR HAR HAR I'm not funny
<DSNesmith> more spoilers for ASoIaF:
<RosePetal> You got rich.... from being rich.
<Klumzeedragon> Elit3xPon3 Which one?
<desertman2> I wonder if I should go play some Basement Collection
<MrBen> ...though I HAVE played the game. ....like, three times.
<otakon> fluttercry: thus the term Sexposition
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ndv7a58O1ru3r25o1_500.png
<DSNesmith> the entire thing with tyrion and sansa was so sad
<otakon> also
<RosePetal> Duh, I is acting.
<Bjornfot> Ok, so how long is this gonna buffer?
<Spazturtle> OMG PANIK DA STREAM IS DEAD!!!!
<otakon> The movie is SO bad it killed the stream
*PillowPoni|Minecraft looks at TF2 slowly downloading
<otakon> I knew it
<RosePetal> HAL?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
<Elit3xPon3> on the livestream site the silent theatre im there watching ponies with 3 ppl
<otakon> THE MOIVE IS SO BAD
<pony_6732> should show mlp while kerjiggering
<otakon> it KILLED THE STREAM!
<CrimsonPhoenix> pyrocatboy, glorious
<DSNesmith> the stream couldn't handle a two-layer flashback
<Dark92Enigma> Ryunosuke: Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
<DSNesmith> it overloaded
<AlienWarhead> Spazturtle PANIC PANIC PANIC
<MrBen> pyrocatboy: OPEN THE POD BAY DOORS, HAL
<Ryunosuke> I am Galstaff, sorcerer of light!"
<JESmith> Will we need to refresh when Sumi gets the subs up and working?
<Reikim> But man, the final scene of AGoT, with that girl and the dragons? That was pretty badass.
<otakon> pony_6732: can't
<RosePetal> LOl never heard of this movie so I can't wait to see how bad it is.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> JESmith: I think so.
<Dark92Enigma> AlienWarhead: i meant the movie
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: if the stream could survive Titanic II it can survive this
<Randomnerd> Fuggit, I'm watching "Manos: The hands of Fate".
<otakon> JESmith: he'll give us a heads up
<DSNesmith> the dragons have done fuck all for the next four books
<RosePetal> Sumica will tell us don't worry. Calm down everyone.
<otakon> Randomnerd: there is a game for that
<Ghosties> 04Okay so
<Ghosties> 04We're gonna switch over to the rifftrax version
<Reikim> Randomnerd: That is not a movie, you will not claim it is a movie, I refuse to believe it is a movie.
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: NOTHING can wholly survive Titanic 2
<DSNesmith> I dont' know how AFFC and ADWD could be so bad after the amazing first three
<DSNesmith> I mean
<DSNesmith> clash of kings
<DSNesmith> the comet
<Ghosties> 04Because that one has subtitles in it, and the subtitles are essential for the exposition and all that
<otakon> Reikim: it's creepier in the books
<DSNesmith> that amazing symbolism
<DSNesmith> how could he go from that
<Ghosties> 04So sorry about this, but we gotta do it
<DSNesmith> to detailing tyrion's bladder problems
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: True. I think a part of me died that day that I still haven't been able to bring back
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Where was Gondor when something something Rifftrax?
<DSNesmith> it just boggles the mind
<Obsidian> yay
<Vivix> damn
<desertman2> Thank you
<TWarTovlerWars> Will we start from the beginning?
<CrimsonPhoenix> meh
<MrBen> That's fine
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: it was your sould
<RosePetal> Ok.
<Dr_Fumbles> *M Bison* YESSSSSSSSS
<Ryunosuke> ...
<CoalDust> its cool
<Vivix> Well, I'm oout until it's done
<JESmith> Like we shoulda done in the first place
<Dr_Fumbles> YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<Rookeealding> we can add our own jokes as well
<Ryunosuke> same as Vivix
<MrBen> JESmith: A-MEN
<Reikim> DSNesmith: The dragons do fuck all? Well, shit. That's just great. WAY TO WASTE A GOOD PLOT POINT.
<Everlasting_Joy> (M.Bison) Yes! Yes!
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Sweetie Belle: YES! YES! YES!
<TWarTovlerWars> Dammit. Now I have to make up my own jokes during the movie.
<otakon> Does anyone else suspect that Tyrion is the only person getting out of this at all?
<RosePetal> As long as we get to see how bad this movie is. I'm fine with this.
<Ryunosuke> im out for this movie then
<DSNesmith> it's like
<Spectrum_Rush> http://i.imgur.com/Sf96G.gif
<DSNesmith> well
<OohShiny> still buffering here, you guys?
<DSNesmith> what I think happened
<AlienWarhead> rookeealding like always
<DSNesmith> is he set up a shitload of foreshadowing
<otakon> Reikim: as of yet, they are still very young
<DSNesmith> and then had an ending in mind
<MrBen> PillowPoni: (Twilight) Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Spectrum_Rush: lol
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: probably. I do sort of feel like I've been drifting spiritually aimlessly ever since I saw that movie
<DSNesmith> but realized he had no clue how to get there
<Dark92Enigma> Since Rifftrax = modern day MST3K .............bring it on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<RosePetal> Finally a picture.
<wirisme1989> IT LIVES!
<otakon> CMC KERBALS GO!
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> MrBen: Captain Falcon: YESZ!
<DSNesmith> what movie was this?
<AlienWarhead> OohShiny I see a wallpaper now
<Reikim> DSNesmith: Anyway, I'm coining the term "Robert Jordan Syndrome", where old men start writing long series and end up filling them full of pointlessness.
<RosePetal> CMC ASTRONAUTS.

<TWarTovlerWars> I can't hear the exposition. heh heh heh
<AlienWarhead> Sumica it is destiny
<MrBen> *subtitles
<Reikim> RAWRity: Path of Daggers. I couldn't get past that one. I literally reread the series three times and I couldn't get past Path of Daggers.
<RosePetal> LOl.
<Ghosties> 04D-bag wars
<DSNesmith> it's definitely an acquired taste
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Yay Subfiles?
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Ghosties: lol

<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: :D
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol BIG HOLE
<RosePetal> Hammy actor.
<Dark92Enigma> This sounds like the backstory for NINJA SURF
<OohShiny> lol
<DSNesmith> by far the worst I've ever read
<Everlasting_Joy> Ghosties: :D
<Ryunosuke> otakon, even so, it just doesnt feel right to have to see commentary on a movie without seeing it itself
<Ghosties> 04GENERIC TOKEN NATIVE AMERICAN
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Wait, I think I seen this movie......
<OohShiny> CSI
<Reikim> Rifftrax is better if you've seen the movie alreayd.

<Ghosties> 04I PROVIDE CONVEYANCE!
<otakon> Ryunosuke: doesn't matter it's this or nothing
<AlienWarhead> Fluttershy is a fan of Rifftrax
<otakon> Ghosties: is he crying yet?
<RosePetal> True that.
<Marx> Wait, Sheriff Carter's car?
<Ghosties> 04Not yet
<Ryunosuke> otakon, then I would go with nothing :)
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties: CAP SPAM. I LOVE YOU.
<Kandarihu> Are there subs in any part of the movie other than the flashback?
<PinkieSpice> quickly, get do vah kin fluttershy . :U
<DSNesmith> I keep voting for twilight for the movie
<Dark92Enigma> a
<AlienWarhead> He covered dragon wars you know
<DSNesmith> but it never gets picked
<RAWRity> You know what series is surprisingly consistent despite dozens of books?
<Reikim> I'd rather that we lambasted this movie ourselves.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Discworld?
<Ghosties> 04When there's a dragon flying over his head that's when a single solitary tear will trail down his face
<RosePetal> Lol they hate him because he's not wearing a tie.
<RAWRity> yup
<otakon> AlienWarhead: he's covering them now
<DSNesmith> lol
<Reikim> God I love Discworld.
<otakon> Ghosties: and then he'll get shat on
<Reikim> Terry Pratchett is my idol.
<otakon> lol
<Randomnerd> lol
<DSNesmith> tfw terry pratchett ;_;
<Kandarihu> Well, the Rifftrax is talking over the dialog in the movie, and frankly forcing itself on the scenes without dialog.
<Vivix> While I'm here, anyone know a good Irc client? Hydra sounded good on paper, but last update is 2010 and half the features are disabled
<otakon> we said the same thing
<AJIsAwesome> AlienWarhead: But can he see why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
<RosePetal> My camera can ZOOM SO CLOSLEY.
<Dark92Enigma> AlienWarhead: and Twilight performed a spell that made the rest of the mane 6 sound like Rifftrax
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties: Before it gets ripped off.
<RAWRity> It's sad what's been going on with Pratchett
<TWarTovlerWars> mustard brown looks pretty good
<wirisme1989> i've seen some things maaaan
<OohShiny> lol

<Randomnerd> I need to look for some really bad movies.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> we need more zoom!
<RosePetal> Your a dragon Harry.
<otakon> bc you can do ANYTHING with animation
<Rex_Mundi> Why is this Korean movie staring white people in America?
<MrBen> Ghosties: NO, john. YOU are the dragons.
<Reikim> Pratchett is too goddamn good for Alzheimer's.
<DSNesmith> they're closing in on a treatment for alzheimer's
<Vivix> I like the eventlog and windows and such in HydraIRC, but--so much hassle when options is disabled and such
<Alchemist> hmmm... 4am. I think Ill head to sleep. Goodbye all!
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<Vivix> mIRC hm-

<DSNesmith> not going to have a cure anytime soon though
<Dr_Fumbles> Makes bad movie hilarious
<otakon> wait Pratchett has Al?
<Ghosties> 04Lol

<XaviortheSavior> When did the Mane 6 start sounding like the MST3K crew?
<OohShiny> lol
<Reikim> Pratchett's not gonna let Alzheimer's take him.
<otakon> one of the most imaginative minds in the world
<Reikim> He's going to die first.
<RosePetal> Must touch EVERYTHING!
<wirisme1989> double flashback!
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Vivix: Either mIRC or XChat.
<otakon> and it's gonna slip away
<desertman2> Rifftrax makes this much more watchable

<Ghosties> 04Haha
<RosePetal> Double the Flashback. Double the Fun.
<Tassadork> flashbackception

<Reikim> Pratchett is going to die in the next few years. Assissted suicide.
<AlienWarhead> RosePetal Ha Ha
<RAWRity> You know what book I love? Good Omens. Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman together is just...delicious.

<RosePetal> Oh yeah, where did the scroll go? Witchcraft!

<Kandarihu> Suffice to say, the way this Rifftrax is being shoved down my throat like this, my chances of ever enjoying Rifftrax are diminishing.
<Reikim> House of Leaves.
<Ghosties> 04I guess so, Dark92
<RosePetal> You don't say?
<Reikim> I've heard of that.
<otakon> wirisme1989: awesome

<Barbetos> Ugh
<OohShiny> lol
<DSNesmith> meh
<otakon> SHE'S IMMUNE TO FIRE!
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, I can't concentrate on the subtitles over this.

<Ghosties> 04You need to build a better harem, Haram!
<RosePetal> Harem of girls.
<Reikim> Why don't I have any shoes?
<DSNesmith> see experimentation for the sake of experimentation does not appeal to me
<RosePetal> You must meet my beautiful wives.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol Fugitive ref
<Ghosties> 04whoa
<DSNesmith> lol dat CGI
<otakon> Ghosties: we need a glasses girl, a busty girl and the perfect girl!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> whoa
<Ghosties> 04SUDDENLY
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat cgi
<fluttercry> 05,15LOL
<otakon> HOLY SHIT
<DSNesmith> dat CGI
<AlienWarhead> lol
<RosePetal> lol fake.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....
<otakon> the hell was that?
<DSNesmith> we sci-fi original movie now
<Panda> O____________O what
<OohShiny> AWESOME!
<Everlasting_Joy> "This is my mother-in-law".
<fluttercry> 05,15OH god this is going to be good
<RosePetal> Imoogi.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Lol
<otakon> Dragon
<DSNesmith> warned you fluttercry
<RosePetal> Im Moogie.
<otakon> only SWIMS
<otakon> wait wait
<MrBen> Everlasting_Joy: *spits out drink* xD
<Reikim> A /) if you know what samsara means.
<Vivix> OohShiny, all ponies are horses, not all horses are ponies. This is just a fact
<Rookeealding> Hey leave spike out of this
<RosePetal> So, we have to kill it.
<otakon> the Imoogi ARE only big snakes
<Midnight_Fyre> It's a wyrm
<Crippler> I only pray to albino dragons
<Ghosties> 04Dear God, this movie will be the Gojira of the 22nd century
<Panda> I think that was steve magnets cousin xD
<otakon> they don't BECOME dragons until they get that power
<SaxyPretender> 0,14(\
<RosePetal> It's the Circle of the Life!
<richfiles> Steven Magnet is NOT amused by your comments, RiffTrax
<Rex_Mundi> Something tells me Fluttershy wouldnt like this movie...
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Ghosties: Gojira?
<Sumica> 00,10wait.......did we just have a thirdlayer flashback?
<RosePetal> YES.
<otakon> Rex_Mundi: with dragons yeah
<fluttercry> 05,15yup
<OohShiny> Vivix ponies aren't horses, they are equines, they are horse cousins
<XaviortheSavior> lol
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> manatees
<desertman2> Yes we did
<otakon> Sumica: eeyup
<Ghosties> 04Only, not nearly as iconic
<Prick> sea serpent to be precise
<Ghosties> 04Godzilla, PillowPoni
<otakon> Sumica: flashbackception
<Sumica> 00,10good god, we have to go deeper
<AlienWarhead> the element of harmony
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Sumica: Permission to whip out the Inception button?
<RAWRity> it's experimentation for the sake of giving a new experience to readers outside of the general novel format. Making a book's format tell the story just as much as the words.
<Meanwhile> I no longer know what's flashback and what's not.
<otakon> THIS IS SO GETTING WMC
<Vordox> Sumica: more derper, accoridn got the reviewers :P
<Rookeealding> so is the kid hearing this story in another langueage from it's own?
<desertman2> Is the whole movie flashbacks?
<RosePetal> From now on, you must take this necklase from Spencers.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14(also helps that a song in Soul Calibur V is called Samsara: The Wheel of Eternity)
<Vivix> OohShiny, not true- as faras I know they're the same genus and all. A pony is, as far as I've been told, a height specification within the selected breed
<Rex_Mundi> OohShiny: No, ponies are simply small breeds of horse, same species.
<pony_300> It's dangerous to go alone! Take this!
<Ghosties> 04But Fluttershy likes it!
<otakon> Meanwhile: when we see..there he is
<fluttercry> 05,15We need to go deeper
<Reikim> Anyway, I can empathize with that one. Only Revolutions. Because sometimes, my mind does actually look like that.
<XaviortheSavior> Stop switching timelines!
<wirisme1989> nested flashbacks ftw
<Sumica> 00,10suddnly
<Fou_Lou> Nope. If off. Cant stand Rifftrax. see ya all around.
<Fou_Lou> night
<RosePetal> Pilgrims.
<DSNesmith> oh boy
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> wtf
<wirisme1989> what we need now is a flashback within this flashback
<DSNesmith> dat CGI
<otakon> HOLY SHIT
<AlienWarhead> WTF
<RosePetal> THE HUNS.
<Ghosties> 04Jesus, even Sauron wants them
<Vivix> Night Fou_Lou
<Jigglysaint> look a moose!
<DSNesmith> CGI attacks
<RAWRity> look, it's the Gungans!
<Reikim> IT'S THE CLONE ARMY!
<Tassadork> surprise!
<Klumzeedragon> Suddenly another flashback!
<otakon> suddenly Dinotopia invades
<XaviortheSavior> oh wee oo
<RosePetal> OH NOES slug monsters!
<Rex_Mundi> power rangers
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> pokemon
<Midnight_Fyre> When did we start watching Dinotopia?
<RosePetal> lol POKEMONS.
<Meanwhile> One does not simply walk into...woah you know what go ahead.
<otakon> SQUIRTLES!
<Everlasting_Joy> That' an awesome idea!
<DSNesmith> LOTR budgets got smaller after the third movie
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Sumica: Permission to link Inception button?
<TWarTovlerWars> finally
<Reikim> It's the CLONE GUNGAN ARMY!
<fluttercry> 05,15pokemon x LoTR
<fluttercry> 05,15do it
<AlienWarhead> pokemon + LOTR = this?
<Sumica> 00,10fine
<otakon> actually it's pretty good looking
<Rosfox> XD
<RAWRity> wow, Reikim and i are on the same wavelength tonight. Back to back star wars references
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Thanks :3
<MrBen> Fluttercry: Yes. Agreed.
<pony_472> is this that Dragon Movie?
<RosePetal> Did you think cannons can stop me?!
<Barbetos> Final Fantasy?
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> http://inception.davepedu.com/
<DSNesmith> peter jackson's latest movie was not blessed with a large budget
<Rex_Mundi> the hell is this?
<Vivix> Pony: a horse of a small breed, especially one below 15 hands (or 14 hands 2 inches).
<pony_300> This rifftrax is pretty bad; the ID4 rifftrax last week was EXCELLENT
<TWarTovlerWars> Pokemon + LoTR = 8th Pokemon Movie
<Kandarihu> I just hope we can have it without the Rifftrax tomorrow.
<RosePetal> Well there was one dragon so I guess.
<Deadlypon3> Man, that CGI is...very video gamey
<RosePetal> They screwed.
<Sumica> 00,10we must find the chosen woman. Bomb the city
<Ghosties> 04So it's Godzilla meets Transformers meets Lord of the Rings
<otakon> RosePetal: actually it's not a dragon yet
<TWarTovlerWars> Explodium
<Meanwhile> Those...exploded rather viciously.
<Dark_Horst> dinosaurs with rocket launchers. becasue we can
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: or rather, it was, but then he turned it into 3 movies because he forgot how to edit.
<fluttercry> 05,15Ghosties meets pokemon
<otakon> yeah that's not gonna work
<Tassadork> dinosaur rockets. my night is complete
<Reikim> Wait, what time period was this in?
<MASF123> Anyone seen Kung-Fu Hustle?
<Deadlypon3> Sumica This CGI is REALLY video gamey
<Klumzeedragon> Inception Bwoooooon fits perfectly with this movie.
<OohShiny> sure that'll help it
<DSNesmith> .....
<AlienWarhead> War has changed
<otakon> Tassadork: that is not all
<Ghosties> 04Meets Pokemon
<Reikim> Because I'm pretty sure Korea did not have cannons at this time.
<Meanwhile> Outer space time.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Dammit Mr. Bay, stay out of movies
<RosePetal> Dinosaurs with Launchers. Your arguement is invalid.
<DSNesmith> you wanted a 12 hour movie?
<otakon> damn
<Eli> if she's there, and they need her, why are they blastin the village?
<Ghosties> 04Battletoads
<Meanwhile> You think they had dinosaurs?
<Ghosties> 04Oh my
<RAWRity> Reikim: Fuedal Japanarea
<otakon> battletoads
<fluttercry> 05,15Battletoads....
<Spazturtle> Those are god dame missiles
<otakon> lol
<RosePetal> MICHAEL BAY!
<Reikim> And those are European-style cannons.
<Tassadork> otakon: yeah we're still early on
<DoctoDoctorWho> Brumak, that is all
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> inb4 goddamit
<MrBen> Battletoads....
<fluttercry> 05,15These guys are so awesome
<otakon> OH MY GOD
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: I'm talking about the Hobbit
<pyrocatboy> I am finding this awesome.
<DSNesmith> ah
<XaviortheSavior> Micheal Bay is so getting off on this.
<MASF123> Who is Ghosties? Btw.
<Meanwhile> They're riding raptors.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> inb4 goddamit
<DSNesmith> wait it's 3 now
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> again
<DSNesmith> I thought it was just 2
<AlienWarhead> 16th century missiles
<otakon> LOL!
<desertman2> I bet this is the best part of the movie
<RAWRity> yep
<Meanwhile> Why are you complaining about the cannons.
<Ghosties> 04I'mma mod
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Midnight_Fyre> Reikim: 1500s
<RosePetal> Find the girl. But you might have killed her.
<Meanwhile> Wombo combo
<otakon> I am laughing my ass off here
<RosePetal> Dragons finally appear.
<fluttercry> 05,15MASF123 one of the very first mods....
<richfiles> Imma pre-order Battletoads! :D
<RAWRity> nope, they finished up filming and Jackson announced it would be THREE movies
<Reikim> The Hobbit does not deserve three movies. It isn't nearly as long as the LotR trilogy.
<Rex_Mundi> Stratadons, hide the ponies!
<RosePetal> He ate him.
<DSNesmith> WATCH IN HORROR AS THIS DINOSAUR... gently pushes over a rock fence
<Pale_Horse> I love those little pewter dragon statues. :)
<fluttercry> 05,15Someone call the pawn stars guy and ask if he has battletoads
<otakon> yh they do not stand a chance
<MASF123> Really? Oh wow. :O
<Tassadork> so enthrian vs rocket launcher dinos. who wins?
<RosePetal> HIde your kids.
<DSNesmith> Wilhelm
<Ghosties> 04WILHELM
<Klumzeedragon> Heya MASF123! :)
<wirisme1989> wilhelm!
<MrBen> Wilhelm!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> WILHELM
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Dragons standing upright on back legs?
<XaviortheSavior> wilhelm!
<Spectrum_Rush> ilhelm
<Reikim> Hell, it's the only LotR book that's readable
<DSNesmith> dat wilhelm
<Meanwhile> Wilhelm. Here?
<otakon> WILHEIM!
<AlienWarhead> WLHELM NOOOO
<RosePetal> lol Wilhelm.
<pony_300> WILHIEM yea
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> WILHEM
<Reikim> Also a Wilhelm dammit
<TWarTovlerWars> Wiru Herumu NUUUU
<MASF123> Hi
<DSNesmith> wat
<RAWRity> Reikim: they're gonna be padding it with stuff from Tolkein's lengthy notes, as well as bits of the Silmarlilion
<Rookeealding> so.. they new these things exisited and they never build up a good defence for them
<Ghosties> 04This movie is so all over the fucking place
<DSNesmith> wat
<otakon> Rappy WHY!?
<CrimsonPhoenix> MASF123, go read the meet the staff, about us, faqs and stuff
<Everlasting_Joy> Jurassic Park!
<desertman2> wilhelm didn't fall down
<DSNesmith> only LOTR book that's readable
<otakon> Ghosties: you have no idea
<ArcherJoe11> Why always poor Wilhelm
<DSNesmith> oh you didn't just go there
<RosePetal> What the?
<OohShiny> where's the blood?
<Rookeealding> this is being discribed to the kid
<Reikim> So yeah, I bet manechat is pulling out the rape jokes now.
<pony_300> this is sort an eastern 300
<Midnight_Fyre> Reikim: Agreed. At first I was excited for the Hobbit movies, but now I'm afraid they are going to drag out a lot of pointless scenes just to fill 3 movies
<DSNesmith> such SAVAGRY
<otakon> what?
<RosePetal> Why are they stripping them?
<TWarTovlerWars> Wilhelm was also in the 2nd Twilight movie
<OohShiny> WHERE'S THE BLOOD?
<Everlasting_Joy> "They just want to strip the women."
<Panda> wait... power rangers? O____________O
<Ghosties> 04ME
<Ghosties> 04IT'S ME
<Crippler> how do they know it wasn't on the OTHER shoulder huh?
<Rex_Mundi> these guys are way too shiney.
<XaviortheSavior> Not my daughter, you bitch!
<Ghosties> 04I'M THE TATTOO LADY
<Vivix> OohShiny, looked it up, horse and pony are Equus ferus caballus
<Reikim> DSNesmith: I mean it in a kind of loving way. The Hobbit, I mean, is the only one of average length and detail. I love it to bits.
<otakon> Lady spills the beans
<AlienWarhead> Rosepetal to find the dragon tatoo
<sub06905|iPod> ello everypony :)
<TWarTovlerWars> To look for the Yu i Joo
<Panda> Ghosties: I KNEW IT!
<RAWRity> Midnight_Fyre: actually, instead they're just going to be telling us more of the story than the book did.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> SO it's Pokemon meets 300 meets LotR meets Power Rangers?
<RosePetal> I'm the Girl with the Tatoo.
<pyrocatboy> Ghosties Have you ever seen 30 Days of Night 2: Dark Days?
<otakon> he's dead
<Pale_Horse> That dad is taking a LONG time to fetch an ambulance, isn't he? :|
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello sub06905|iPod
<RosePetal> Ded.
<DSNesmith> in other words they're making stuff up
<XaviortheSavior> !
<RAWRity> Midnight_Fyre: for instance, we'll be seeing what Gandalf was up to that whole time.
<otakon> okay this flashback is RIDICULOUS
<DSNesmith> oh
<DSNesmith> okay
<Rex_Mundi> Stratadons!
<Reikim> Is manechat being as stupid as I guess it is?
<DSNesmith> I'm good with that
<Ghosties> 04I haven't pyrocatboy
<otakon> it's LONGER THAN THE FIRST SCENE!
<otakon> DAMN!
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: no, they're taking it from Tolkein's notes and other books.
<RosePetal> Wizards!

<Midnight_Fyre> Actually I am in the middle of rereading the Hobbit right now. To be honest, it's not as good as I remember it being as a kid
<RosePetal> Ded.
<MrBen> Hilarious
<Everlasting_Joy> Sound more like gorillas.
<OohShiny> old man is gandalf
<Ghosties> 04I just heard the spear throw sound from Scorpion in Mortal Kombat!
<DSNesmith> wonder how they'll create dol goldur
<Klumzeedragon> Not the Horse Soldiers!

<TWarTovlerWars> tuskan raiders /me laughs
<RosePetal> Your getting owned by Dumbledore Ninja. Your doomed.
<Reikim> Wow, these guys are as shitty with swords as stormtroopers are with blasters.
<DSNesmith> I didn't think he had physical form
<DSNesmith> it's just proto-sauron, isn't it
<XaviortheSavior> oh mai
<RosePetal> NOW KISS.
<otakon> I know what they did this
<Meanwhile> RosePetal: You're*
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: and Sylvester McCoy will play Ratagast
<DSNesmith> before he goes back to the black tower
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> RosePetal: But where's Voldemort Ninja?
<Ghosties> 04If you want a movie in this era, watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger
<pyrocatboy> Ghosties It is the shittiest REAL VAMPIRE movie I have ever seen.
<fluttercry> 05,15does this movie ever take a break?
<StrayPony> And all this is being narratoted to the little boy?
<fluttercry> 05,15It's all over the place
<OohShiny> blowjob
<RosePetal> Even though we barely knew him.
<otakon> they took a purely Korean movie and SPLICED IN ENGLISH APRTS
<Polydunami> Say what, Ghosties?
<Klumzeedragon> Not the horse soldiers!
<ArcherJoe11> Korean Gandals is beating up the army while the young guy is flirting.
<MrBen> "Oh, come off it. I killed MY father and you don't hear ME whining about it."
<RosePetal> Oh no.
<Sumica> 00,10this reminds me of the princess bride

<DSNesmith> well, one flashback
*SaxyPretender is sadly not watching the movie, because searching for textbooks is a pain in the ass
<PillowPoni|Cleaning> MMMMMMMMMMMMM
<RosePetal> The Flashback was in the tea.

<DSNesmith> SaxyPretender: tell me about it

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That doesn't look like a Dragon >: (
<AJIsAwesome> What the heck?! That flashback was all over the place!!
<Everlasting_Joy> He doesn't know what "star-cross lover" means.
<Ghosties> 04NO SCOOTS
<otakon> WindWhistler|AFK: he started it over
<Ghosties> 04DAMMIT

<TWarTovlerWars> Baracki wasn't allowed in the KKK? why?
<Reikim> Also, fuck this grampa, he doesn't even have a fake Asian accent.
<Ghosties> 04TOTALLY
<PillowPoni|Cleaning> Scoot-Scootaloo: You just missed a flashback
<Deadlypon3> Why have the first scene when you could have just set the first scene here?!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NUH UH
<DSNesmith> implying there are dragons in dragon-wars
<Pale_Horse> Seriously. that dad is taking his sweet-ass time fething a doctor... :(

<WindWhistler|AFK> otakon: Is this the only RiffTrax you guys watched?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>no ebook version
<RosePetal> Keep this. You will bring great danger to the land.
<otakon> THE WAR IS FOR THE IMOOGI TO BECOME DRAGONS

<AJIsAwesome> He's been "waiting" for him? Oh, my...........:O
<fluttercry> 05,15wut
<Ghosties> 04We were once asian
<RosePetal> I was that man.
<Midnight_Fyre> Old guy is getting rid of stolen antiquities by leaving them with the kid
<Spazturtle> I am. stream fresses
<DSNesmith> don't bother
<Ghosties> 04Exciting, huh?
<otakon> WindWhistler|AFK: no
<Sumica> 00,10try not to fuck it up this time

<PillowPoni|Cleaning> Pale_Horse: Maybe that heart attack was staged for the sake of the plot
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>Chegg doesn't have it, so no rental
<Rave|Gym> :o
<Meanwhile> Scoot-Scootaloo: http://i.imgur.com/nj02j.jpg
<MrBen> Sumica: LOL
<Reikim> Eh, personally, I don't like Ebooks.
<WindWhistler|AFK> otakon: How many have you guys watched?!
<DSNesmith> comp sci course textbooks are usually just stuff you can find online
<RosePetal> So you can fail AGAIN.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm so very tempted to pirate it
<Reikim> I prefer hard copy books.
<Rave|Gym> What is this? O.o
<Deadlypon3> Yay for tramp stamps :P
<RosePetal> Kubrick Stare.
<Yahooz|SSBB> books in general :p
<Jigglysaint> girl with the dragon tatoo?
<Reikim> Rave|Gym: A very crappy movie.
<DSNesmith> I prefer physical textbooks
<Spazturtle> "WTF is this man talking about?"
<Pale_Horse> I know the haert attack was fake. But the dad thought it was real.
<RosePetal> Now, he is a woman.
<DSNesmith> because of the larger pages
<OohShiny> end of the long flashback
<WindWhistler|AFK> .....
<PillowPoni|Cleaning> End flashback 4
<Ghosties> 04"Haha, I'm black"
<DSNesmith> but fun reading? ebooks all the way
<DSNesmith> just too convenient
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same here, but price takes priority
<pony_300> tramp stamps are only found on the lower back, not the shoulder, so....
<Spazturtle> lol
<RosePetal> Hello Lando.

<WindWhistler|AFK> Guys, how many RiffTrax have you watched so far?
