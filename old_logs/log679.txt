<Cranberry_Scotch> Vinyl's eyes are magenta because the target demographic felt red eyes were scary
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, YEAH That's what everyone keep saying
<Buytoast> B-B-BUT LUNA ISN'T LIKE THAT.
<DocSane> Luna's one of my top favorite characters, actually.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but they just deny the truth
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> could be
<Buytoast> YOU SCREWED UP YOUR CHARACTER HASBRO!
<CrimsonPhoenix> THEY ARE MAGENTA
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, we totally need Trixie to come back, and have it revealed that she has no motivations, she's just a bad pony.
<CrimsonPhoenix> The HUE is magenta
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Oh please let that happen.
<Spectrum_Rush> this chat sure is muddy right now...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Luminosity DOESN'T CHANGE THE HUE
<DocSane> fluttercry: But she really isn't bad at all.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also fluttercry likes playing with ashe right ?
<fluttercry> 05,15yup
<Rex_Mundi> CrimsonPhoenix: Magic
<Meanwhile> DocSane: SHE'S A COMPLETE DOUCHE
<Cranberry_Scotch> Trixie is just arrogant
<Kinixys> It's cool. Fanon evolves with canon.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrQtHB7gBLo
<DocSane> She's a braggart, but she didn't do anythign except challenge others to a skills contest and then beat them.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, Just keep denying the truth
<CrimsonPhoenix> Her eyes a MAGENTA
<CrimsonPhoenix> PERIOS
<CrimsonPhoenix> PERIOD**
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, please. Anything other than the "sad, misunderstood 'I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED'" character everyone loves writing. -_-
<Rex_Mundi> CrimsonPhoenix: Nay! I say magic!
<fluttercry> 05,15I like the how to play garren comment
<Spectrum_Rush> suddenly Ninjazz
<Buytoast> oh boy, the fanon keepers are out in full force
<Cranberry_Scotch> if trixie returns,she'll either have restarted her show, or be a homeless bum with no money to her name
<Meanwhile> DocSane: Bollocks, she didn't even demonstrate the same skills, she just incapactitated the challengers.
<fluttercry> 05,15lol dat video
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, yeah like I said just keep denying the truth
<Lunar_Brony> fluttercry I like the idea of her wanting revenge on Twilight Sparkle for humiliating her, as it would be in her eyes. Then again, "Turnabout Storm" is covering that . . .
<Meanwhile> How to play Garren?
<Meanwhile> DEMACIA.
<Buytoast> oh man
<Cranberry_Scotch> And I doubt they'll dothe former after the Derpy Incident
<sonicdude558> DAMN IT FLASH
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, and suddenly Terra.
<Meanwhile> S'all you need to know.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Trixie>Diamond Tiara IMO
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> You spin me righ round like a record
<fluttercry> 05,15Hide in bushes, spin, win
<DocSane> Look, I think the character that got the worst shaft was Gilda.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Latter*
<ASoftFluffyThing> I can forgive bragging but being blackmailed? NO.
<Buytoast> using that crappy phonix wright pony movie for headcanon justification
<richfiles> I think Luna was handled perfectly. There is a mix of socially awkward Luna, gaming Luna (the fun has been doubled), out of date Luna, regal Luna, shy Luna, and remorseful Luna. Buck, they even had a dash of wrathful Luna. :)
<Rex_Mundi> Silver spoon > Diamond tiara
<Buytoast> how can you even
<fluttercry> 05,15Miss Fortune? Slow them down, use the wave shot thing, win
<NocturnalBlade> ASoftFluffyThing: agreed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> one of my favorites http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA69aLMhy1M
<Cranberry_Scotch> Sorry, used the wrong word
<BaconMane> 0,5Nini
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: theres no Terra here watcha talkin bout :S >_><_<>_><_<
*ASoftFluffyThing nearly got blackmailed and it wasn't fun
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also guys
<Ninjazz> Nacht BM.
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<fluttercry> 05,15These are awesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> Derpy can never be the "Doctor Whooves" assistant
<DocSane> Comes back to visit the one cool pony she knew, has to deal with some ADHD nutball butting in all the time, and then has her friend reject her in favor of said nutball.
<Buytoast> it's true
<CrimsonPhoenix> Colgate
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, I'm not sure. >_____>
<Buytoast> he's not even in the show
<CrimsonPhoenix> Colgate's name is actually Romana Minuette
<Lunar_Brony> I was blackmailed once.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=ELU3zNneAzAjU&feature=plcp playlist if you want
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: next you'll be askin' for Rohan >_><_<
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lyra and Bon Bon aren't marefriends
<richfiles> Hearts and Hooves day... Derpy and "Time Turner" are seen together on the overhead view of ponyville! :P
<Buytoast> boy, you're grasping for straws
<sonicdude558> brb guise i am going to clean my keyboard :(
<richfiles> But they ARE friends
<fluttercry> 05,15We also need Gilda to come back in some fashion that ruins her fanon character
<fluttercry> 05,15thank you
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, I don't know a Rohan. Wait, please tell me that's LotR thing.
<Cranberry_Scotch> It was more of a case of if you can't tolerate mynew friends, maybe we shouldn't be friends anymore
<CrimsonPhoenix> fluttercry, you mean being lesbian for Rainbow Dash?
<Buytoast> every damn character has been warped into a twisted fanon version by now
<e`> everyone needs to be friends.
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, you mean as a total lesbian for RD?
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: yes
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Lunar_Brony: :O Who would blackmail you?! You're AWESOME...AND CANADIAN! :$
<Dken2021> Buytoast even lickety split?
<Buytoast> not even a shred of the original aspect of them has truly remained
<fluttercry> 05,15that would confirm fanon
<CrimsonPhoenix> what other fanon can we destroy
<Meanwhile> If they ruined the fanon for every character I'd just laugh.
<Meanwhile> It'd be glorious.
<richfiles> Wah, I don't like fanfics at all, so I pray for the show to go out of it's way to rape and pillaige fanon! Real mature guys! BWAHAHAHA!!! :D
<Buytoast> i wish they would
<DocSane> The thing is, the staff use the fanon to create the canon characters.
<fluttercry> 05,15Dude, if I was at Hasbro, I would do that
<Buytoast> it'd be like christmas
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, I meant her fanon character that needs to be destroyed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> richfiles, I enjoy fanfic
<DocSane> I mean, Derpy ended up with the muffins thing actually made official.
<Cranberry_Scotch> When?!
<CrimsonPhoenix> but there is a limit where I draw for fanon and canon
<Buytoast> just take a hammer and smash the fragil hivemind mentality revolving the non main characters
<jimmy> it's my birthday!! i just right now became 13
<CrimsonPhoenix> like I do not consider any of the fanon facts as show facts for one
<DocSane> Dr. Whooves is now referred to by that name by the staff.
<jimmy> red's input: ...
<fluttercry> 05,15Season 3 is only 13 episodes because it's a systematic destruction of fanon
<NocturnalBlade> happy birthday jimmy
<Buytoast> your life will be filled with ought but strife and misery
<CrimsonPhoenix> DocSane, is it in the show?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Happy birthday jimmy
<Ninjazz> You know, the sign of good fanon is when they make LOGICAL estimations of the characters ALREADY MADE. You don't create more character traits, you work with them.
<DocSane> CrimsonPhoenix: No, but it shows up in the storyboard notes I've seen posted.
<Buytoast> LOGICAL
<Buytoast> AHAHAHA
<Tovler> Well, there looks like there will be a lot of Fluttertree-in-Hurricane-Fluttershy style fanservice in Season 3, so...
<Cranberry_Scotch> Two of the episodes are about some race of ponies called Crystal Ponies
<CrimsonPhoenix> DocSane, if it's not on the show
<Rex_Mundi> I hate how 'Pinkamena' meens depressed alter ego of Pinkie Pie, like Pinkamena isnt pinkie pies full name when shes normal and happy, somehow.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Then it's NOT CANON
<CrimsonPhoenix> NEXT
<DocSane> CrimsonPhoenix: Derpy got canonized and then decanonized.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Confirmedby Hasbro themselves
<Dken2021> wasn't pinkemina a middle name?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I said nothing on Derpy
<Ninjazz> It's her real name.
*jimmy is at gold's house
<CrimsonPhoenix> but she's a rare case
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0Hk1HNfkUI
*Spectrum_Rush this chat is hilarious
<NocturnalBlade> Its Pinkamina Diane Pie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> seems about right
<richfiles> Derpy got a hold of a canon... but then... "I just don't know what went wrong!" :P
<Dken2021> no wait, her middle name was Diane
<DocSane> CrimsonPhoenix: Actually, it kind of got confirmed by Hasbro because they made WeLoveFine change the spelling from Whooves to Hooves.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Pinkamena*
<Cranberry_Scotch> Pinkamena was Pinkie's first name, middle name Diane, last name Pie. Pinkie is a nickname
<NocturnalBlade> thanks you ASoftFluffyThing
<richfiles> Nope. Pinkamena Diane Responsibility Pie
<CrimsonPhoenix> DocSane, it's still not in the show
<Buytoast> man DocSane, you just keep hainging on to whatever shreds you can muster up
<fluttercry> 05,15The best part about these are they are 100% true
<CrimsonPhoenix> Not in the show means not canon
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> So, where's SB's stream?
<DocSane> Buytoast: This whole fandom mainly consists of fans scribblings notes in the margins.
<richfiles> The eternal aether
<Cranberry_Scotch> Canon is either in the show, or confirmed by the creators
<Rex_Mundi> Oh, 13 episodes of season 3 will bring the show to syndication, if more episodes than that are produced that G4 will be larger than G1! Also, I think a two parter or a movie will be made.
<richfiles> Or he hasn't started yet
<NocturnalBlade> guys, describe the Yugioh movie in one word (besides WMC lol)
<richfiles> Ugh
<gold> happy birthday jimmy ( typed and sent on the same laptop that jimmy is on :P )
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> zombies
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cranberry_Scotch, words of Lauren herself, if it's not in the show then it's not canon
<DocSane> Cranberry_Scotch: Please. I'm a Doctor Who fan. Canon arguments are par for the course.
<fluttercry> 05,15how to play Lulu. Press Q. It's support so it's balanced and fair
<CrimsonPhoenix> DocSane, I love doctor who as well
<DocSane> Cranberry_Scotch: Even stuff that shows up on the show will be contradicted by stuff from later shows.
<gold> ... jimmy just called me randomly pointless....
<Dken2021> I'm seeing a TV film possibly, but it's a streach
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I still can draw the line between fanon and canon
<Sweetie_Belle> hi :D
<VenHur> Still no stream yet?
<Dken2021> hai Sweetie_Belle
<NocturnalBlade> hi Sweetie_Belle
<Cranberry_Scotch> A film is possibly in the works
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it's
<Ninjazz> It'd be like the 2 parter episodes, only without the break in the middle.
<Kinixys> hi Sweetie_Belle.
<Ninjazz> AND still rushed.
<Sweetie_Belle> im back!
<DocSane> Cranberry_Scotch: The city of Atlantis sank for three totally incompatible reasons in old Doctor Who.
<NocturnalBlade> guys, describe the Yugioh movie in one word (besides WMC lol) please ^_^
<VenHur> Oh hi Sweetie_Belle.
<Sweetie_Belle> i got my new computer :)
<Tovler> Noisy
<fluttercry> 05,15dammit. now I really want to play LoL but I don't have the time
<J_E_Smith71> NocturnalBlade: It didn't get WMC'd
<VenHur> The Yu-Gi-Oh movie in one word: Bullshit.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Strange
*Kurra be off to listen to numbers stations. :)
<Kurra> ninight all!
<DocSane> Y-G-O was "expository".
<CrimsonPhoenix> VenHur, you mean FRIENDSHIP
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Kurra: dream of ponies
*Kurra tucks ERRPONY in bed, slumber party! :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> NocturnalBlade, YELLING.
<Cranberry_Scotch> That's DBZ
<Kinixys> Bye Kurra.
<Moopy> hey sorry i wasn't chatin i was AFK what did i miss?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night Kurra
<NocturnalBlade> sorry to aska second time, just thought everypony was distracted with the whole cannon argument
<Tovler> Inceptions was expository /me feels bad
<Kurra> Ninight. :>
<NocturnalBlade> night Kurra
<Tovler> *inception*
<Lunar_Brony> Sketch_Toku_Brony it's a long story, but I'll try to summarize it as best as I can. Back in my elementary years, I think it was grade 4, there was a kid that basically the entire class had a reason to hold a grudge against. I tried to ignore him, but for some reason he vented his anger on me. One day, he told me he'd give me a black eye if I went anywhere near him. I tried for months, but then he walked over to me. Told me get
<Rex_Mundi> G1 got a movie for theaters, why not G4, surly the brony population + the little kids with parents population would make it worth it to Hasbro, who appearently can afford to sink money into a movie like "Battleship"
<DocSane> Sweetie_Belle: Will you name your new computer "Cutie Mark Aquisition Program"?
<Lunar_Brony> that was longer than I hoped..
<Spectrum_Rush> tl;dr
<Cranberry_Scotch> ASoftFluffyThing: yelling is Dragon Ball Z's thing
<CrimsonPhoenix> yelling is an anime thing
<ASoftFluffyThing> Cranberry_Scotch, a lot of yelling was in the YGO movie as well.
<Ninjazz> http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii56/Near8821/TL3BDR.jpg
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 where oyu hiding?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Lunar_Brony: man that guy sounds like his life wasnt 20% cool enough
<Sweetie_Belle> DocSane: lol...i name it the fluttershy program :$
<Tovler> non CGI movies have it really rough in US theatres nowadays
<Tovler> *animated movies*
<DocSane> Rex_Ivan: They expected Battleship to do well.
<Rex_Mundi> IM not Rex_Ivan damnit!:[:D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> did anyone like RE6?
<Cranberry_Scotch> Swearing is one Piece's thing
<DocSane> Rex_Ivan: They don't really expect an MLP movie to be a blockbuster.
*Tovler prays Battleship did poorly
<Dken2021> I saw thursday that they're making Judge Dread in 3D
<Ninjazz> It's already out...
<Cranberry_Scotch> Ever since Funimation took over, that is
<DocSane> Damn autocomplete. Sorry, Rex.
<Dken2021> oh
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane I expected it to do well. Hell, I have a plotline that anyone I ask who's seen the movie agrees is better.
<Dken2021> never seen it, was it as cheezy?
<Ninjazz> Dken2021, wait. Do you mean the new one or are they remaking the original in "stunning" 3D?
<Sweetie_Belle> no stream :(
<gold> so jimmy(duh), silver, cystal, red, blue, green ( and me of coures !) are all at my house in new bark town for jimmy's birthday
<Rex_Mundi> But what if there was an MLP movie for theaters? Im sure it would do reasonbly well.
<Dken2021> I belive it was for 3D, so a rerelase I think
<Buytoast> oh god pokemon RP
<fluttercry> 05,15Alright, I'm going to bed. Night everyone
<fluttercry> 05,15Also no RP!
<Dken2021> seeya fluttercry
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night flutterchu
<thelonepony> night fluttercry
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night fluttercry
<Sylandest> night fluttercry
<Ninjazz> I'd watch it. Don't know about everyone else.
<Lunar_Brony> g'night fluttercry
<ASoftFluffyThing> flutterchu, sorry for the misping
<Ninjazz> Dken2021, aaahhh. Then I was referring to the new one that came out a month ago I believe.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> night fluttercry
<NocturnalBlade> nite flutterchu
<Ninjazz> nacht fluttercry.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Rex_Mundi: inb4 people bitch about because it expectations were too high.
<Wirisme> night fluttercry
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *about it
<Dken2021> Ninjazz oh, didn't know there was a new one
<gold> (why we're at my house and not jimmy's house i don't under stand tho...)
<Dken2021> man, I'm out of the loop of new films
<Tovler> If they can get the Sex and the City/Bridesmaids crowd into an MLP movie, then maybe a strong MLP movie could work.
<Wirisme> As am I
<Ninjazz> Dken2021, eyup. I think I heard someone say it was decent enough.
<Rex_Mundi> I saw the new Resident Evil movie, it was entertaining as a mindless film. Not a good movie, and deffinatly a terrible Resident Evil "adaptation"
<Ninjazz> Know what, might watch a film this weekend in the theatres. Anyone with a better social life than mine care to recommend any?
<Tovler> Looper, I guess
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey Phase4 did you check dis bundle ? http://groupees.com/bm5
<ASoftFluffyThing> The Avengers, if it's still in theaters.
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Busy when you think about it, you realize why. Battleship is a household name. Even if you haven't played the game, you atleast know the idea. What the movie did was take the name and slap aliens onto it.
<Ninjazz> That one with Joseph Levitt? YES.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i agree Rex_Mundi lol RE 1 w/ the bad voice acting was BETTER imo :D
<Moopy> Man its chilly night over here
<DocSane> Oddly enough, I heard Dredd 3D is pretty good.
<Meanwhile> T you never check skype, want to see what the current group image is?
<Ninjazz> ^what i heard too.
<sonicdude558> Back! My keyboard is clean :)
<Phase4> 00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, don't really want any of those games
<Tovler> Ninjazz: Yeah, that's Looper
<Cranberry_Scotch> ...
<Ninjazz> Tovler, actually been wanting to watch that, thanks for reminding me.
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz depends on the theatre. Smaller theatres show movies that the 12-cinema IMAX theatres showed a month ago.
<Tovler> Ooh, Frankenweenie is out
<Lunar_Brony> gah, no
<Ninjazz> Lunar_Brony, I live on a tiny island out in the Pacific. The theatre here is SMALL.
<Moopy> Heh dat soon face
*Tovler picks a Tim Burton movie for A.
<DocSane> A shame The Raid isn't playing as a double feature with Dredd.
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz okay. What's playing in the next couple days?
<NocturnalBlade> anyone got soon opinions of the Silent Hill movie coming out?
<NocturnalBlade> *some
<Lunar_Brony> nnope
<Ninjazz> Lunar_Brony, I have absolutely no idea.
<Spectrum_Rush> oh was lotto today? or is it tommorow?
<Wirisme> today
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, today.
<NocturnalBlade> Spectrum_Rush: it was today
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz -____-
<Lunar_Brony> that doesn't help
<Lunar_Brony> at all
*Spectrum_Rush checks homepage
<Rex_Mundi> Will Bronycon have a place to swap MLP trading cards for people who have multyples?
<Ninjazz> Lunar_Brony, well... judging by the commercials, Looper and Dredd are going on I think.
<Ninjazz> And other's too uninteresting at first glance that I CBA to remember the titles.
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz okay, I can only give you a synopsis of one and a "by ear" opinion on the other.
<DocSane> Anyway, I think it's time I went to bed.
<NocturnalBlade> nite DocSane
<thelonepony> night DocSane
<Spectrum_Rush> nice choice CrimsonPhoenix
<weegee2062> hello
<Dken2021> seeya DocSane
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: sup son!
<Lunar_Brony> g'night DocSane
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DocSane: dream of ponies
<DocSane> That's the hard part about waking up so damn early. I fade at midnight
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spectrum_Rush, Mmmh?
<thelonepony> hi weegee2062
<Wirisme> goodnight DocSane
<Ninjazz> Lunar_Brony, I was going to go spin the idea of watching Looper with my mother and brother but alright.
<DocSane> Night
<Dken2021> wllo weegee2062
<Ninjazz> Nacht DocSane.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just took it for one reason only
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: A movie
<weegee2062> when will the show start
<Ninjazz> When does the magic begin?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah I just took it for one reason only
<Dken2021> kinda already did, but you can come back tomorrow
<Dken2021> or stay with us
<weegee2062> im still new to this
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s80vveaXhH4 This....is my only reason I pick that movie
<Ninjazz> Have you read the rules and glanced over the FAQ, weegee2062?
<weegee2062> and i just became a broniy
<Dken2021> coolio
<weegee2062> yes
<weegee2062> brony
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh nice a Newfoal
<J_E_Smith71> weegee2062: The show started at 7 PM EST and was over a little while ago
<Ninjazz> Already one step better than most newfoals.
<CrimsonPhoenix> weegee2062, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
<NocturnalBlade> o, a new person? hi weegee2062

<weegee2062> hi:)
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: just that song Or cause of good ost in movie over all
<CrimsonPhoenix> just that song
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile what ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spectrum_Rush, do you know why JUST that song?
<richfiles> Ah... :) Windows Setup... This can't possibly be difficult! :$
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> weegee2062: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2637/
<Spectrum_Rush> woop chat derped
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/KRMWX.jpg
<J_E_Smith71> weegee2062: It will encore at 2 PM EST. At 10 AM EST there should be a Hub stream.
<Tovler> :( The King's Speech looks like one of those Full-Screen kind of movies like The Godfather
<weegee2062> my cutie mark would be a video game controller
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> my mind just broke
<Sweetie_Belle> we got light snow this morning
<Spectrum_Rush> ok so what'd you say CrimsonPhoenix ?
<Sweetie_Belle> :)
<J_E_Smith71> Didnd't they say that SuperBrony would be along later?
<NocturnalBlade> weegee2062: :O we have something in common ^_^
<CrimsonPhoenix> I said that I pick the movie only for that song along
<CrimsonPhoenix> do you know why?
<weegee2062> yeah
<weegee2062> :)
<Spectrum_Rush> no why?
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz I just looked up "Looper" on imbd, so you can see if you like it. It's a Bruce Willis movie, so yeah http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1276104/
<NocturnalBlade> why CrimsonPhoenix
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Because it's a great song? :S
<Ninjazz> Your group sounds like fun.
<weegee2062> whats an anit-brony
<Ninjazz> And very strange.
<NENUDJUS> they call me "The MoonRaper"!!
<Dken2021> oh cool weegee2062, have any favorite games?
<Ninjazz> Lunar_Brony, Aaaawwww yes.
<The_Scientist> whens the stream gonna come
<Tovler> I picked Big Fish for the vague brony references, mainly Edward Bloom = Apple Bloom and The Story of the Blanks parallels.
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, i'm reminded of the blarrarrarrg meme
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://derpy.me/VrU1X This is why
<Meanwhile> Keep calm and blarraarrg.
<weegee2062> minecraft, borderlands 2 there just so many i cn't say them all:$
<weegee2062> can't
<Tovler> Super for B because of the blatant tentacle hentai scene.
<NocturnalBlade> oh wow CrimsonPhoenix :D
<Dken2021> weegee2062 ah it;s cool, it happens to the best of us :P
<Lunar_Brony> Ninjazz this one's about Dredd. From what I hear, the effects are good and use of slow-motion is incredible, but I think it was Sumi who went and saw it. Him or Shizuka, I can't remember. Rated R, and this is the Canadian rating, which is looser than what the US says http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343727/
<richfiles> Well I'll be darned... Hard drive C IDE connected, no power. Drive D power but no IDE... What the buck??? :)
<Rex_Mundi> I hoping for a Future Fallout movie, hopefully based on new Vegas and not FO3.

<Rex_Mundi> I hate that its a 2 party system in the US, id vote for the communist party if they had a canidate this year, just so 3rd parties have more influence. Not really a communist but I am a socilist, so theres that...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Sketch_Toku_Brony: The song when you're deep underwater?
<richfiles> Ah, Windows Setup... Round 2... Surely nothing can go wrong! :)

<Tovler> voting for Green Party or Gary Johnson is what's hip in town.
<richfiles> Ron Paul was the only sane candidate
<Tovler> ah, Jill Stein is her name.
<weegee2062> just kidding i'm to young to vote
<Rex_Mundi> in anycase, my vote is for obama, i like him and think he has done an alright job
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Busy: YES its so spooky 6_9 i like it :$
<richfiles> Everypony's too afraid to vote for him cause he's old, and cause they fear their vote would be "wasted"
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Same here. I LOVE it. I actually fall asleep to it sometimes. :$

<NocturnalBlade> chat derped
<Rex_Mundi> Romney is very fake, he was governer of Massachusetts and he said that he really though of Massachusetts as his real home, even though he only had a vacation home here and he spent his life in utah. And once he became govener, he spent most of his time out of state, entrenching himself in the republican party.

<Lunar_Brony> ah
<TheKatPony> the quality is pretty bad for me lol I cant really tell whats going on
<Lunar_Brony> this game reminds me of Sonic Colours, but I'm not entirely sure why
<richfiles> My computer died a slow and agonizing death of obsolesence, so I got a used PC... But it only had Win 2000 Pro,a dn The MAIN software I run would not run on anything less than XP Pro. It's been YEARS since I was able to use it.
<Buytoast> man, i wish i had this game and not just teh demo disk with it on it
<Buytoast> then again, that goddamn asshole clock always got me
<richfiles> I have this game for both SEGA Saturn and for Wii.
<Lunar_Brony> oh, THAT Saturn
<flutterchu> hello
<Lunar_Brony> hi flutterchu

<VenHur> Ooh, Nights Into Dreams!
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: IKR?

<flutterchu> so this is what nigh's is like let me tell you i did NOT expect it to be like that
<twilight_sprinkle1> fukken internet
<flutterchu> *knight
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: Most people don't. :D
<flutterchu> *knit's
<twilight_sprinkle1> inb4 my internet dies in a second again

*twilight_sprinkle1 nc ghost
<flutterchu> AJIsAwesome: thank you
<VenHur> There's a psuedo-remake of the game called Journey of Dreams.
<twilight_sprinkle1> wups
<TheKatPony> I dont love my pc
<Buytoast> yeah, you can't expect it to be like this, especially when every piece of promotional work for it has shit like this involved
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: No problem. :)
<Buytoast> goddamn
<J_E_Smith71> Tovler: Nope
<VenHur> Only difference is the story and the human kids...
<VenHur> Gameplay wise is still the same for the most parts.
<Tovler> Hmm. I'm tempted to pick Southland Tales since it would get WMC'd without a doubt
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: What's the synopsis?
<VenHur> But, I got to go to sleep...see ya.
<AJIsAwesome> Night, VenHur. :)
<NocturnalBlade|Read> nite VenHur
<weegee2062> bye
<TheKatPony> night VenHur :)
<thelonepony> night VenHur
<flutterchu> brb another person signed up on my camp
<Lunar_Brony> my first PC's motherboard fried, my second one (which I bought) won't run any games, and now I'm borrowing a friend's so we can play TF2 together, until I build a new one that is
<weegee2062> any one what to play borderlands 2
<flutterchu> THE PERSON WHO SIGEND UP IS A BRONY ;u;
<Lunar_Brony> nice
<Tovler> Its a pretentious political movie that takes place in a futuristic Los Angeles
<TheKatPony> awesome
<weegee2062> or tf2 or minecraft
<Rustymeat> Wut ius stream?
<Buytoast> dare i ask what horrid thing YOU are having people sign up for?
<weegee2062> weegee2062
<CriticKitten> Tovler: .....Southland Tales? OH GOD PLEASE NO
<Lunar_Brony> Rustymeat I have no clue
<soulrider95> gesus christ NG+ on borderlands 2 is difficult
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: Seems interesting.
<Rustymeat> ah its alright
<otakon> soulrider95: you get used to it, my strategy is stay as far away as possible and use snipers
<CriticKitten> That movie is so terrible that space and time itself break around it.
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: Just one question: Why do you think it would get WMC's?
<Rustymeat> soulrider95 what platform are you playing on?
<TheRandomkid321> I'm back from my long-ass trip
<Tovler> Southland Tales is unbearable outside of the thermonuclear babyfart monologue
<soulrider95> otakon: but I'm a combat shotgun siren TT_TT
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, TheRandomkid321. :)
<soulrider95> Rustymeat: PC
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome which one, the Yu Gi Oh one?
<Lunar_Brony> oh
<otakon> soulrider95: still, get a good sniper
<Lunar_Brony> nevermind
<CriticKitten> It has no redeemable qualities.
<CriticKitten> None.
<AJIsAwesome> AH.
<Rustymeat> ah
<otakon> soulrider95: I'm a damn gunzerker
<AJIsAwesome> I see.
<weegee2062> moon canon time
<TheKatPony> im gonna go to sleep, night everyone.
<TheRandomkid321> Is Season three out yet? I cannot seem to find any eps of it.
<twilight_sprinkle> so i guess yugioh didnt get wmced?
<soulrider95> otakon: Lol. Thats the anti-sniper right there
<AJIsAwesome> TheRandomkid321: Nope.
<Tovler> AJIsAwesome: people will ask, "How much time is left" and the mod will say "1:20:00 left"
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle nnope.
<kirzstryfe> wait a sec, there was a powerpuff girl movie?
<twilight_sprinkle> ok good
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Nope, and thank god for it
<J_E_Smith71> TheRandomkid321: Not till next month
<twilight_sprinkle> we should a dbz movie sometime
<twilight_sprinkle> it would get wmced in 20 minutes
<kirzstryfe> Phear teh Nyanbbit! :3 http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbfkf1EfNN1rhznrzo1_400.png
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<TheRandomkid321> Where did that september theory come from then?
<soulrider95> This super badass buzzard is rapin me
<Rustymeat> Is everyone who is plaing borderlands 2 playing it on PC?
<J_E_Smith71> twilight_sprinkle: Espically if it was Evolution
<Lunar_Brony> I legitimately like the movie, but I couldn't enjoy it much because the chat wouldnt's top bitching
<Tovler> Seeing the The Rock and evil John Lovitz can only hold your attention for so long
<otakon> soulrider95: yeah still, when you've got Rabid Skags that do 15K damage an attack, and move faster than you and have over 500K HP you NEED distance. Even if you're not specc'd for snipers it's good to have them
<TheRandomkid321> My thinkgeek stuff has arrived ^_^
<soulrider95> I have a decent sniper, I just hate using it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02TheRandomkid321: Awesome :)
<AJIsAwesome> TheRandomkid321: What did you get? :)
<Lunar_Brony> TheRandomkid321 nice! Whatcha get?
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: yeah i can understand that, there was an excessive amount of bitching. bitching is only not allowed when its a movie a mod likes :\
<TheRandomkid321> so much stuff I cannot be bucked mentioning it all.
<soulrider95> If the game has shotguns that is what I use.
<XylemTube> Suddenly casinopolis
<soulrider95> Yay I reached level 48
<J_E_Smith71> That Sonic Adventure pinball music
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle Scoots liked it, but that's Mr. MLG. He was bound to love it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it seems
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: To be honestm I was making fun of the movie on purpose. I don't hate it, but it's not a great movie.
<AJIsAwesome> *honest
<richfiles> 19 minutes... 19 minutes and I can reach the first step to once again being able to program CPLD chips again! Oh digital logic design, how I have missed thee! :)
<Lunar_Brony> I know for a fact fluttercry hated it
<twilight_sprinkle> i cnat say i liked it, but it wasnt unbearable, it was fun to laugh at, ive seen worse movies
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Hardly. WMC is reserved for things that are literally unwatchable.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the only one i know it the one with mojo jojo origins or something like it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Number 39...not bad ><
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: oh i know tht, he repeated it about 50 times
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Need to be better O-O
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: That's because he doesn't like anime.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: hardly what?
<Dken2021> so what kind of genre would you describe NiGHTS?
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: lol iv been trying to sign in to steam but its so slow lol
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: A DBZ movie would survive that cut. :p
<NENUDJUS> laggy day for me...
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<AJIsAwesome> What is it, AdamTheDuck?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: They're at least watchable, just stupid.
<Rustymeat> The movie was fine
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsAwesome, oh NENUDJUS just can't log into steam. :/
<AJIsAwesome> Oh.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: hell no. theyre pathetic, no story, just explosions with a an obvious ending. i couldnt watch them for more than 10 minutes
<CriticKitten> Now, what Tovler suggested as a B....
<J_E_Smith71> CriticKitten: Unless it was Evolution
<CriticKitten> THAT is a WMC movie
<richfiles> NiGHTS = on rail flight game. What would that classify as???
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Here's what the original version of the game looked like O3O
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome that's not an excuse I can accept. I can understand why he wouldn't like anime, but that's pretty general.
<Rustymeat> The movie is better if you played yu gi oh before and can see how batshit insane some of teh cards are
<Rustymeat> all the deux machina is amazing
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: ill brb i have to close this internet to open steam faster :p
<twilight_sprinkle> ill either vote for an austin powers movie or for otakon's B choice
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Naw, really they're just dumb action scenes. Even those are not nearly what I'd call "unwatchable". Keep in mind that the official bar between WMC is "somewhere between Babes in Toyland and The Last Airbender".
<Dken2021> mmhm, delicious deus ex
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: I agree. He doesn't really seem to give it a chance. However, he did see FLCL earlier this week and kept complaining throughout it.
<CriticKitten> None of the DBZ movies are anywhere near that bar.
<CriticKitten> Even Evolution.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: my B choice is Dead Alive(aka Brain Dead) which is a very over the top zombie flick by Peter Jackson
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: theres no to laugh at in those movies though, theyre too monotonoues. it gets old very fast, chat will probably just fall asleep after 40 minutes or so
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: what about that other B you showed me?
<AdamTheDuck> Why no one vote for any horrors? It's October! :<
<twilight_sprinkle> *nothing to laugh at
<Rustymeat> I am
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: that one was Birdemic
<otakon> AdamTheDuck: DEad Alive, HELLO
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe because I'm not a horror kind f guy?
<J_E_Smith71> AdamTheDuck: The mods may show some automatically for a Halloween event
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i know, but why arent you voting for it/
<Rustymeat> I am voting for Beyong Re-animator
<Dken2021> AdamTheDuck Resident Evil?
<Lunar_Brony> Rustymeat that's because any show based off a game was designed so A) if you know how to play, you can jump in anywhere in the series and sometimes, but not always, B) they explain how to play at the very beginning of the series
<Rustymeat> Beyond*
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: bc I really want to see Dead Alive
<CriticKitten> Don't confuse "is bad" with "is fucking terrible to such a degree that it is widely blamed as the cause of all of the world's wars"
<AdamTheDuck> Bleh, Resident Evil?
<AdamTheDuck> Too much action >.>
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: that doesnt matter. a lot of terrible movies are fun to laugh at, which is why they dont get wmced, in dbz theres nothing to laugh at, its just boring
<Lunar_Brony> Rustymeat if you're good, you can figure out how to play by watching them play a couple dozen times, but the more complicated a game is, the harder it is to understand
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Not unwatchable. Boring to you, fair enough. NOT unwatchable.
<J_E_Smith71> I'm sure they'll do another Halloween event like last year
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: not unwatchable to you i guess. its unwatchable to me
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I think we need to sit you down in front of some actually bad movies so you know where the line is.
<Rustymeat> some of the rules in the anime are complete bullshit
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Because you set your WMC bar way too high.
<Kimori> I'm going to bed, goodnight everyone
<Tovler> k, back. I had to rage about Southland Tales to myself.
<Dovah> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/340/978/75e.png
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: no, its just that i find dbz to be worthless shit
<CriticKitten> Do not dare vote for that movie, Tovler.
<Cades> night
<CriticKitten> I will travel back in time to assassinate you before you can vote for it, if you do.
<Lunar_Brony> you want to know a movie I dislike? The Karate Kid (2010) and I have good reasons to support my opinion
<Rustymeat> We watched that
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Shoot. I don't mind.
<Rustymeat> I believe
<Tovler> CriticKitten: But evil batman-voiced Jon Lovitz
<Tovler> with bleach blonde hair
<Lunar_Brony> and it isn't just "remade is never as good as the original"
<Lunar_Brony> *remake
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And again, fair enough, but that's just your opinion. We're not talking about stuff that one or two people think are kind of bad or boring. We're talking about films that are quite literally irredeemable garbage from start to finish.
<richfiles> DEAR LOVELY LUNA!!! XP Pro started!!! :)
<CriticKitten> Things that are panned so badly that the chat starts to die off from watching it.
<Lunar_Brony> the two movies are actually quite different. Different ages of the protagonist and antagonist, different time periods, different target audience
<AJIsAwesome> THAT WAS CLOSE>
<AJIsAwesome> *.
<Lunar_Brony> different martial art, which really nags me
<CriticKitten> WMC isn't supposed to be a "that movie was sort of bad, let's not watch it again" clause, it's a "that was fucking awful, and watching it again will give me cancer" clause.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: no but if theyre absolutely horrible, then its fun to laugh at it. some movies are the kind of boring thats just dull and boring, and for dbz matches that category. wmc is a subjective judgement anyway, fluttercry wanted to wmc yugioh, i thought it wasnt that bad
<Tovler> But Southland Tales only gave me aids
<weegee2062> h
<CriticKitten> Know the difference. And if your bar is set too high, then to steal dari's catchphrase, it's man-the-fuck-up time. :p
<CriticKitten> WMC generally isn't subjective. >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> it was today
<CriticKitten> The only two movies to ever be WMC'd were unanimous choices.
<CriticKitten> And were already critically panned anyways. >_>
<Dken2021> all As I see
<Tovler> I wonder why Spider's Tale was taken off the list?
<Lunar_Brony> Some movies are just bad enough that you can laugh at how bad they are, while others are too awful for the possibilty of enjoyment from pointing out how bad it is
<twilight_sprinkle> and imo dbz is wmc-worthy, theres nothing to laugh at and its very boring, so for me thats a wmc, ive managed to enjoy almsot every b-movie ive seen here
<Dken2021> I think that was before they establish the WMC rule
<Tovler> maybe it was auto WMCd for being only 40 minutes long?
<CriticKitten> Whereas most people (thankfully) realized Pyramid of Light wasn't anywhere near it. fluttercry was just overreacting by a lot.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Have you ever seen The Last Airbender?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: indeed i have
<Dken2021> something tells me SB has played this game alot
<Lunar_Brony> the chat was bitching too much about this and that for me to really enjoy it
<AJIsAwesome> Speaking of that, did they ever air that movie here?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Darn...
<CriticKitten> That movie was shown. It wasn't WMC'd. Consider THAT before ranking a DBZ movie as WMC-worthy, bro. >_>
<Tovler> Pyramid of Light was noisy. Babes in Toyland was "There's 1 hour left?! k, bye."
<CriticKitten> (in fact, TLA was shown TWICE)
<Tovler> Also, Nobody was talking about the movie during the second half of Babes.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: Because, like i said, that movie is horrible and has a lot to laugh at, the acting, the crappy green screen, and it just a hilarious fail. dbz takes itself too seriously to be that hilarious, theres nothing to laugh at there, its just boring fights
<Lunar_Brony> Pyramid of Light is a bit easier to understand if you know how to play the game, but it isn't required.
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, chat was pretty much overreacting suring the Yu Gi Oh movie. I was doing it mostly because it was fun making fun of the movie.
<AJIsAwesome> *during
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: if youre saying that people will actually enjoy the monotonous fighting, thats another matter. we cant really know that for sure
<Tovler> Everyone wants to point and laugh at TLA. It can't be WMCd
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> thats my point
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 moo
<thelonepony> night everypony :)
<Dken2021> I should watch TLA sometime, I got it on DVD
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo :D
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle what's TLA?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02One more time O-O
<twilight_sprinkle> bye thelonepony
<Lunar_Brony> g'night thelonepony
<AJIsAwesome> The Last Airbender
<Dken2021> last airbender
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: the last airbender
<weegee2062> night
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, thelonepony :)
<Lunar_Brony> oh gawd
<CriticKitten> Uh, people in here were laughing their asses off at Pyramid of Light. There's a 0% chance that any DBZ movie save Evolution would get even close to WMC, dude.
<thelonepony> and thanks for the stream SuperBrony64 mpp :3
<Dken2021> and seeta thelonepony
<thelonepony> moo*
<Tovler> At least they were reacting to Pyramid of Light. Then again, we were reacting to Epic Movie
<weegee2062> wuts this
<Lunar_Brony> I can understand why that got WMC'd
<Lunar_Brony> and I haven't seen it
<AJIsAwesome> Too bad I wasn't here for Epic Movie. Would've loved to see how the chat reacted to it.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: the movies i saw, there was nothing to laugh at, it was just fighting. if people dont enjoy the fighting, what do you imagine theyll enjoy then?
<CriticKitten> You're not even being remotely realistic and you're letting your hate of the movies cloud your judgment. Pyramid of Light is worse than many of the DBZ movies and it's not WMC material. >_>
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: it was horrible
<Dken2021> you mean what's showing now weegee?
<AJIsAwesome> I've never seen it, so I wouldn't know.
<twilight_sprinkle> me neither
<Rustymeat> is superbrony trying to stream?
<CriticKitten> (and mind, I *like* Pyramid of Light, I think it's adorkably funny)
<AJIsAwesome> Rustymeat: Trying to? He is.
<Lunar_Brony> Rustymeat he is streaming
<Tovler> I liked Epic Movie in that you know precisely why its not funny and how it could have been funny.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh i just remembered a b-movie i once saw with drake bell from drake and josh. but it was pretty tasteless, so cant vote for that
<CriticKitten> Epic Movie....was just pathetic
<otakon> CriticKitten: PoL is WMC material if you ask me, it's melodramatic with a oversaturated soundtrack with lot's of innuendo and a non-sensical plot and setting.
<twilight_sprinkle> or rather dont want to
<Rustymeat> I dont see anything
<Rustymeat> oh I see now
<richfiles> Oh my God... I nearly shorted my PSU just now... After installing XP... and that damn other hard drive is flagged with a half installed windows, so if I boot with it plugged in, it asks for the damn Install disk! AHHHHH!@!!DKJNS :)
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Did it involve superheroes?
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: no
<CriticKitten> otakon: Your bar is too high
<AJIsAwesome> WAIT
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry, otakon.
<CriticKitten> otakon: It's not even close to the level of Babes.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: im being very objective, you on the contrary just say "its not bad enough to be WMC", im actually explaining why it would be wmced
<AJIsAwesome> Wasn't meant for you.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: it involved grown men playing a card game for the FATE OF THE WORLD
<PonyNegZero> cardgames on motorcycles
<otakon> CriticKitten: no at least Babes was COHERENT
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I was trying to talk to twilight_sprinkle.
<Tovler> Don't forget long. WMC movies have to wear out their welcome with 1 hour to spare.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: You're not being even slightly objective, you're saying it would be WMC'd because YOU don't like it. I'm telling you that you have no clue what the clause is meant to be used for.
<weegee2062> the world make so much sence
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: ah yes, it did involve superheroes
<otakon> CriticKitten: PoL is goddamn soap opera for babby
<Lunar_Brony> PonyNegZero I don't even understand how the game works like that
<PonyNegZero> Lunar_Brony: join the party
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And it probably comes from not watching enough truly BAD movies to recognize the difference between something that's bad because it's not for you, and bad because it's literally flawed in every conceivable fashion.
<Polydunami> Is this NiGHTS?
<otakon> CriticKitten: all PoL is an extended commerical for the card game
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: skip the personal assaults, ok? i explained that if people dont enjoy the monotonous fights, which i cant know for sure, but if they dont, then theres nothing else in those movies to enjoy, which is why it would be wmced
<Rustymeat> nights into dreams
<Rustymeat> if im not mistaken
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: the whole you not liking DBZ again?
<Polydunami> Right, the full title
*Tovler remembers how happy he was to see Will Sasso in Southland Tales.
<Lunar_Brony> I have a friend who's a local Yu Gi Oh tournament regular. He's been playing since he can remember and literally grew up with anime. When I asked him how they managed THAT style of gameplay, he said "I have no fucking clue."
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: movies in particular
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Exactly. It's YOUR opinion, that's why it isn't worth WMC'ing.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: ah
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: im saying i think it would get wmced
<taoumi> eh wah?
<Lunar_Brony> the sad part is there really isn't a way to play it IRL, but then again, does anyone know how it works in the first place?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: what would? the DBZ movies? yeah probably not, they wouldn't even be shown I think.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: im not saying its worth wmcing because i said so, im only saying i suspect it would get wmced ecause the fights are monotnous, and if people dont like it, then theres nothing else to those movies. all im saying is that theres a high chance, nothing more
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: it sure as hell doesn't work like they show in the movie/shows
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: You're not getting it. WMC isn't supposed to be an opinion thing, it's a movie that fails on such a tremendous level that it has no redeemable features. It's not opinion, it's a movie that does everything *wrong*.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: "
<CriticKitten> *"I find the fights boring" != WMC
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: not necessarily, the room did everything possible wrong, but its hilarious and people enjoy laughing at it
<CriticKitten> We already tried to misuse it today, let's stop trying to misuse it please. >_>
*Tovler picks Southland Tales to remind ya'll what WMC is.
<otakon> CriticKitten: PoL has only ONE real funny scene, other than that it's a lot of yelling and exposition and over dramatic music and lousy music.
<Polydunami> So are encores not allowed or something? Even after so long after a movie has been played for BMN?
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: DO you mind if I ask you a harmless question?
<CriticKitten> There is not enough hate in my body for you, Tovler
<flutterchu> http://s1260.photobucket.com/albums/ii571/flutterchu2/?action=view&current=FluttershyandEvilLeafy_zps053826f8.png
<AJIsAwesome> *Do
<Tovler> I'm too chicken, I'll either pick Super or Brick
<CriticKitten> If you win, I swear to God you're so assassinated
<otakon> what?
<CriticKitten> :|
<otakon> CriticKitten: win what man?
<Lunar_Brony> one of the only reasons I watch Yu Gi Oh is because of the fighting. For a long time, I couldn't play the freaking game, but I watched the show and got it from then on.
<otakon> I'm lost atm
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Same here.
<CriticKitten> otakon: Tovler wants to pick Southland Tales for his B.
<Tovler> or I love you Phillip Morris for B.
<otakon> okay what's Southland Tales?
<otakon> Also can't we get a GOOD B movie for once?
<DoctoDoctorWho> hi AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Would Kung Pow be considered one?
<Lunar_Brony> The same goes for Bakugon and . . . another game people used to play at my school. It was basically battle tops
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DoctoDoctorWho. :)
<Tovler> It would be evil since I KNOW Southland Tales is WMC.
<otakon> for Christ's sake why do people keep picking ones where the ONLY redeeming way to watch them it to riff on them.
<CriticKitten> otakon: Let's put it this way. You want to WMC PoL because you didn't like it. Southland Tales is a movie that deserves WMC before it's even shown.
<Lunar_Brony> hi DoctoDoctorWho
<flutterchu> otakon: the B movie is supposed to be a bad movie
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: i cant go on steam! keeps saying your internet is to slw :/
<Tovler> Kung Pow is bad but because of Wii U, it pretty much has to be picked
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: Not really bad, just not that good a movie.
<CriticKitten> otakon: I believe Linkara joked about it being "so bad that it breaks time and space".
<AdamTheDuck> That's a shame NENUDJUS :/
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: Wii U?
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: your not gonna belive this, but Im tired.
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: How?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DArn
<Lunar_Brony> Tovler what does the Wii U have to do with anything?
<flutterchu> this game is liek.......bubsy bocat + super mokey ball 2 + sonnic the headgehog + kirby air rid = this
<otakon> CriticKitten: no I want to WMC PoL bc it's a lousy movie that's ONLY redeeming feature is getting made fun of and not event hat bc it takes itself SO seriously it breaks itself. It's pretenious, over dramatic, the music is too goddamn in the way. It's a goddamn mess and it's nothing more than an extended card games commercial.
<Lunar_Brony> DoctoDoctorWho I'm tired, sore, and emotionally wrecked. Join the club.
<otakon> CriticKitten: it doesn't even play the goddamn GAME right
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: I think it has something to do with the fact of me getting up at 2 in the morning every morning since september started
<NENUDJUS> AdamTheDuck: but i can go to steam website... odd
<Tovler> AJIsAwesome: The female character constantly makes this Weeyuu sound while she talks.
<Tovler> In Kung Pow
<CriticKitten> otakon: And yet it's still better than either of the WMC'd movies, and better than several other films we've watched that didn't get WMC'd.
<otakon> CriticKitten: it takes so many liberties with the rules of the ACTUAL YGO card game that it's worthless even as a goddamn commercial
<flutterchu> TheGreatAndPowerfulT:rixie dissaproves
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lunar_Brony: Im just a tired madman, nothing new here
<CriticKitten> otakon: So by that standard, no-WMC is the right call.
<otakon> CriticKitten: ...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehhh ?
<sonicdude558> YES NIGHTS
<Lunar_Brony> otakon that's the point of a B movie, dude. You either make fun of it, legitimately enjoy it, or STFU about it.
<Polydunami> I have an issue with one of the movies being ineligible to be picked.
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: What movie is it?
<Polydunami> Spaceballs.
<Slen> Knights 1?
<Tovler> I can't think of any other unquestionable WMC movies.
<CriticKitten> otakon: The show takes liberties with the card game too, far more gross than the movie did, so that's rather irrelevant. >_>
<AJIsAwesome> Slen: Nights.
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: okay there IS a difference between a BAD movie and a B movie right? a BAD movie just isn'tenjoyable to watch
<Slen> er, nights
<SuperBrony64> 11,02NiGHTS
<Lunar_Brony> that's because it was shown during the annual Tom awards Polydunami, otherwise I would pick it too
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: May I ask why you add a Liarjack emote to some of your sentences? Is it because you're implying that you're lying?
<Polydunami> Well, where does it say that, Lunar_Brony?
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: well sorry for not staying longer, but I require sleep. Bye friend:)
<CriticKitten> otakon: The film is basically just a long episode of the show slapped together, honestly. Nothing more or less.
<otakon> CriticKitten: dude they basically spit iin the face of their SOURCE MATERIAL for Christ's sake! Also, it's over dramatic as hell and way too campy at that. They treated a children's card game with the same reverence as a world champion boxer
*AJIsAwesome glomps DoctoDoctorWho goodbye :)
<Lunar_Brony> otakon of course there is. A bad movie is beyond the point of beingable to make fun of
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Awww yeah
<Slen> Over the years I've noticed how many games, shows, and movies have used godzilla monster noises for monsters.
<otakon> CriticKitten: and THAT is why it's WMC
<CriticKitten> otakon: So just like the show?
<Lunar_Brony> g'night DoctoDoctorWho
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Instant 100 G :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night DoctoDoctorWho :)
<otakon> dat music
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: NICE :O
<otakon> how I love it
<CriticKitten> otakon: Gee, I guess that means the movie did a damn good job of imitating the source material then.
<CriticKitten> :p
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That's what I need to do at the end of the level O3O
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami I dunno. I just found out by ear of chat.
<otakon> CriticKitten: no, THE CARD GAME IT IS BASED OFF OF
<Lunar_Brony> if that makes sense
<otakon> CriticKitten: NOT the series
<Polydunami> Doesn't make it official.
<otakon> seriously it's nothing more than a goddamn advertising ploy
<Slen> I beat the Oregon trail in 10 seconds today :D Hacks ftw!
<sonicdude558> "What the"
<DoctoDoctorWho> And If Im up b4 5, thats just Dovah impersonating me, pay no mind. G'night everypony.
<CriticKitten> otakon: It's a movie based on the show. Ergo it is judged based on the show. And in that sense, it's literally just an episode stretched into movie form.
<AJIsAwesome> Night, DoctoDoctorWho. :)
<Lunar_Brony> CriticKitten Yu Gi Oh is a card game, which spawned a couple anime series, and some of those spawned movies. Pyramid of Light happens to be one of those movies
<Tovler> I still need to see the non-abridged 2nd YGO movie
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah and the show wasn't that good either
<CriticKitten> otakon: The show takes HORRENDOUS liberties with the show as well.
<sonicdude558> BANG BANG
<CriticKitten> otakon: *with the card game, rather
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah so it doesn't even do the SOURCE MATERIAL justice
<otakon> CriticKitten: it's a show based on a card game
<Lunar_Brony> otakon depends on the show and your opinion.
<CriticKitten> Lunar_Brony: You're talking to the wrong guy, dude, I grew up on the original TCG and show. :P
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: it's YGO
<Lunar_Brony> Yu Gi OH
<otakon> like goddamn BeyBlades
<otakon> they're fucking spinning tops
<otakon> seriously that's it
<Dken2021> I remember that one duel with yugi and kaiba where kaiba threatened to jump off the tower if yugi wins
<Lunar_Brony> THATS ITS
<Lunar_Brony> it
<CriticKitten> Lunar_Brony: So I know that it's a TCG. I also know that the TCG actually was created AFTER the show, and was based on a card game created in the manga.
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVED Beyblade as a kid...... :S
<otakon> it's nearly as bad as the faux anime from South America about the marbles
<SuperBrony64> 11,02otakon: you who likes action figures that have chips in them for games like Skylanders :P
<CriticKitten> But then my nerd is showing.
<Lunar_Brony> Beyblade! That's the other anime I watched growing up!
<otakon> SuperBrony64: no that's you
<Polydunami> Damn, I remember that, Dken2021 :D
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: /)
<Lunar_Brony> Yu Gi Oh, Bakugon, and Beyblade.
<Dovah> Sooooo hows it going?
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome /)
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: How WAS Bakugan?
<otakon> at least DBZ wasn't made to sell merch
<Dken2021> but the dub sorta changed that to " the force would knock him off" but their holograms, what force?
<CriticKitten> Dken2021: I think the dub suggested that he would be knocked off the ledge if Yugi attacked....but that would not make sense, yeah.
<CriticKitten> Then again, it's a 4Kids dub.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: dude WHAT are you trying to DO?
<Polydunami> Shadow realm :P
<Sylandest> otakon: thats what im trying to figure out
<otakon> time run?
<Polydunami> Shadow realm = Negaverse?
<Sylandest> maybe
<Tovler> Ash battled Giovanni for the first time ever last week. I should go look at it (is too lazy to do it)
<NocturnalBlade|Read> otakon: was about to ask the same thing lol
<CriticKitten> otakon: Neither was the original Yu-Gi-Oh series. >_>
<Dken2021> yea, understood why they did that, but geez
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I need to kill this boss in one hit everytime without fail so that when I clear the course with the highest possible score, I get the maximum multiplier.
<Sylandest> dat explanation of logic
*Tovler ask Brandon about Yugioh Zexal
<Tovler> *asks*
<Phase4> 00,02http://dresdencodak.com/2009/05/11/42-essential-3rd-act-twists/
<CriticKitten> otakon: The series made popular in America came *after* the original manga and anime series, and were drummed up as a marketing gimmick (effectively MtG for Japan, meant to compete with Pokemon and whatnot).
<Dken2021> oh yea, how was zexal?
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64, .-. You're starting to sound like my Asian friend who tried too hard at those DDR games
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome the first series was really good. I picked up the game mechanics quite quickly and was engrossed thoughout the entire thing. The series after, however, wasn't really much to look at. Think of it like Yu Gi Oh on motorcycles.
<otakon> CriticKitten: okay but THAT is not what WE got. We got 90 minutes of people yelling at holograms and acting like it hurt when they got hit. WE got a goddamn extended merch commerciall with LOTS of noise and flash for the kiddies that really is quite lackluster. What it was originally doesn't goddamn mater at this point.
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Oh, you're talking about the remade one a couple years back?
<Tovler> I'm told Zexal got better after a while much like GX did in season 3.
<flutterchu> http://s1260.photobucket.com/albums/ii571/flutterchu2/?action=view&current=twilightsparkle_zps09df33c2.png
<CriticKitten> Okay, I'll go ahead and ask. Where was the merch advertisement?
<AJIsAwesome> I actually LOVED GX. :$
<CriticKitten> Seriously. Point to it.
<otakon> CriticKitten: the cards and the constant saying "This does this, oh THIS card will"
<Herostar> Guys, I have a very serious issue to discuss. Can we pause the stream please?
<Tovler> Season 3 of GX was actually awesome.
<otakon> CriticKitten: the goddamn cards you iggit
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Herostar: Okay, what is it?
<PonyNegZero> Herostar: doubtful
<sonicdude558> What the What The
<CriticKitten> otakon: You mean like the show, which was already advertising the card game?
<otakon> Herostar: um that's up to SuperBrony64 but what's up?
<flutterchu> HEY STREAMER SOMEONE HAS SOMTHING TO SAY
<Herostar> This is a matter of internet violation and security
<otakon> CriticKitten: THAT IS NOT THE POINT
<Herostar> Skype now has a new virus, and a nastyone
<Herostar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWrv6QmTbsE please watch this, I don't want anyone dealing with what i just did
<CriticKitten> otakon: No, that is exactly the point. You're claiming that the movie was one big ad. I'm saying "okay, find the ad", and you can't actually do it. <_<
<Dovah> but no really, whats goin on everyponY?
<otakon> CriticKitten: ON IT'S OWN MERITS IF YOU SAW THAT MOVIE WITHOUT WATCHING THE GODDAMN SHOW IT IS HORRENDOUS EVEN PEOPLE WHO PLAY THE CARD GAME AND WATCH THE SHOW DIDN'T LIKE IT THAT MKUCH.
<flutterchu> Herostar: i dont have skype so im safe good luck
<Herostar> I almost lost it all, but since i have CIA coverage, I was able to be saved.
<otakon> CriticKitten: the cards
<PonyNegZero> does it keep saying "lol is this your new profile pic?" with a link?
<otakon> CriticKitten: seriously they goddamn explain the cards ever 12 seconds
*Polydunami doesn't use Skype... but it seems an ugly situation :S
<CriticKitten> otakon: Yes, they explained what the cards do. Because it'd be a little hard to follow what's happening if they didn't.
<Dken2021> I have skype, but have not used it at all
<Herostar> Please, be wary of this, It's already been in the news
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yes, there is a Skype virus going around that asks you about your Profile pic and gives you a link that downloads a file to your computer.
<Tovler> An evil hermaphrodite from Jaden's childhood gets revenge and all in all, he merges with him/her in friendship.
<Herostar> Correct. I fell for this, For some reason...
<otakon> Tovler: wait what?
<Herostar> I'm using a new pc now, my last one had a nuclear meltdown
<PonyNegZero> ha, my friend already has it (it is rather obvious that it is a virus, no offence)
<PonyNegZero> I've gotten like 20 messages already today
<Herostar> Thank you for the time. I just want everypony to be safe.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: They explain the cards so that you know what they are and what they do. If they didn't it would seem like they're just making crap up unless you know what the cards do already.
<flutterchu> glad i dont have skype
<Dken2021> oh, it's just something that's asking for a download link? isn't that easily avoidable?
<CriticKitten> otakon: Just shouting out what a card does is not an advertisement. There's an actual mechanical reason for doing that: because the only other way to illustrate card effects in the show would be to put a block of text on screen for you to read. REALLY ENGAGING.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Lunar_Brony> otakon you're more used to it if you play the game, because you literally narrate your actions.
<Tovler> otakon: that was Season 3 of YGO GX in a nutshell
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hi AJIsAwesome this is the real DoctoDoctorWho and totally not Dovah <_< >_>
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<otakon> CriticKitten: it's also tons of goddamn exposition and posturing over a goddamn card game every time regardless of the goddamn outcome like it's life of death every time
<Cades> night everyone
<CriticKitten> That's more a problem with the way a show like that works, since if you're playing an unrecognizable game, you have to explain to the audience what's going on, or they won't be able to follow.
<CriticKitten> But it's not a flaw in the movie, just a limitation of creating a movie focused around a game that your audience may not recognize.
<Lunar_Brony> otakon it's an anime based off a game, where life-or-death situations are decided by the outcome of the game.
<Dr_Fumbles> Just watch the Abridged series. They say everything wrong with the movies and show
<Lunar_Brony> otakon they treat it like that because, in the show, it is.
<CriticKitten> otakon: Yes, because the card game in the show is actually sort of a big deal. >_>
<CriticKitten> otakon: I'm guessing you've never seen shows like, say, Cardcaptors?
<otakon> CriticKitten: okay STOP using the goddamn AJ emote
<otakon> CriticKitten: at least THAT has actual MAGIC
<CriticKitten> otakon: So does YGO.
<otakon> CriticKitten: half the time it's goddamn holograms in YGO
<CriticKitten> otakon: Stop being willfully ignorant of what you're talking about.
<otakon> the ONLY time we see "real" monsters is the ass end of the movie
<otakon> CriticKitten: I am talking about he MOVIE on it's OWN MERITS
<otakon> NOT as a whole
<Ponies47> My eyes hurt from playing TF2 to much. Is that even possible? O.O
<otakon> Ponies47: yes
<CriticKitten> otakon: The show clearly states that the card game is based on a real magical game, and the magic transferred into the cards themselves. Ergo yes, there is magic involved.
<Dovah> Ponies47: No.
<XylemTube> This song is relly catchy
<Lunar_Brony> hi Ponies47. Yes, because my eyes can get sore from reading too much
<Ponies47> So many Scout bots :~;
<Herostar> Now that I thouroghly discussed my concerns, Anyone have advice for fallout new vegas? got it yesterday :)
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, eeyup .-.
<Dr_Fumbles> Wait... is this an argument on whether the shows/movies suck? That's like arguing whether toxic waste is bad to ingest...
<Tovler> being overly serious was what hurt YGO 5Ds
<Dr_Fumbles> Too much filler
<CriticKitten> Actually it's sort of amusing.
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, you shouldn't do it too often, take breaks every hour or so~
<otakon> Dr_Fumbles: no he's saying PoL is not bad enough to be WMC material
<sub06905|TARDIS> dat Ponies47 :3
<Ponies47> Dat sub06905|TARDIS :3
<CriticKitten> Playing such a dorky background straight-laced and excessively uptight is actually better than playing it for laughs.
<otakon> hell the 90 minute time is too long for what it is
<Lunar_Brony> 5D's was dark
<Herostar> Pardon? any advice for Fallout: nw vegas? just got it yesterday
<Lunar_Brony> GX was a bit lighter
<Dr_Fumbles> There have been some pretty shitty movies. As bad as YGO is, it's most certainly not WMC
<otakon> CriticKitten: I'd rather them play it for laughs at least then it COULD have been entertaining.
<AdamTheDuck> Herostar, play hardcore mode
<otakon> Dr_Fumbles: so you want to watch it again?
<AdamTheDuck> Herostar, it's not as hardcore as you think~
<PonyNegZero> play hardcore and hard
<AdamTheDuck> ^ yup
<Dr_Fumbles> otakon: FUCK NO! Not in a million years
<Herostar> AdamTheDuck i learnt that the "hard" way xD
<Dr_Fumbles> I didn't even watch it once. I actually left
<otakon> okay guys
<otakon> I'm out of here for now
<otakon> getting grief for being on the PC again
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, otakon. :)
<Lunar_Brony> whichever one the movie was based off of was pretty comedical, but focused on a wide range of characters. The only one I can say bad things about is the one that introduced cards on motorcycles
<otakon> night all see you tomorrow
<Dr_Fumbles> ?
<PonyNegZero> see ya otakon.
<Dr_Fumbles> Night
<Ponies47> Oh and yes mother AdamTheDuck maybe I should take breaks :P
<CriticKitten> I mean your backstory is "The main character is possessed by the spirit of an ancient Egyptian pharoah who played magical card games with monsters for control of the entire world." You try to play that for laughs and you will fail. You play that entirely to the vest and straight-laced, you get a massive fan following.
<Tovler> nite, otakon
<Ponies47> Night ot....
<Lunar_Brony> oh, THAT's 5d'S
<Lunar_Brony> g'night ota-
<Lunar_Brony> gah
<Lunar_Brony> okay, so if 5D's has yu gi oh on motorcycles, WTF am I thinking of?
<Tovler> I kinda wish 5Ds ended after Dark Signers. That last arc just coasted
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Gaaaaah
<PonyNegZero> cardgames on motorcycles!
<Herostar> SuperBrony64 your the one streaming?
<Lunar_Brony> yeah, that's 5D's
<Lunar_Brony> Herostar eeyup
<CriticKitten> And to be honest, this isn't like Twilight where the series is objectively bad to an offensive degree, folks. I wish people would stop misunderstanding the difference between "objective bad" and "I don't like it bad"
<Dr_Fumbles> It's too bad the Pokemon show sucked so much. With a different Main Character and better writers, that show could have had some serious potential... but alas...
<Tovler> throwing that YGO melodrama and you can make anything work.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Herostar: Yeah
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: Agreed.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well i'll go to sleep, Goodnight everyone
<Dr_Fumbles> night
<Lunar_Brony> g'ngiht TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<AJIsAwesome> Night, TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Goodnight everyone who is still in here
<Tovler> Those trailers for Black 2 White 2 with new not-Ash trailers made me drool a bit.
<Dr_Fumbles> yes this ^
<CriticKitten> I mean hell, you want a really bad movie? You want to know what WMCs look like? I can start picking some, if you insist, so that you'll get some perspective. Enough to recognize what a truly bad movie is.
<CriticKitten> :p
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: Sure. Shoot. :)
<Dr_Fumbles> Ash is the worst abomination ever in TV. THE WORST
<CriticKitten> Well let's start with the obvious pick. I see Manos, the Hands of Fate isn't on the WMC list yet....
<Dr_Fumbles> That one Dragon Movie was GODAWFUL
<Buytoast> so my stream may be lagging to kingdom come, but it looks like superbrony is fighting some snakes from a mixed nuts can
<CriticKitten> So perhaps I should choose that as my next B vote.
<Dr_Fumbles> You fiend
<CriticKitten> So that ponies will stop trying to slap WMC on everything in sight and will understand what truly bad films look like.
<CriticKitten> :p
<Tovler> I'm thinking of WMC movies that will make people comfortably leave Bronystate
<Dr_Fumbles> This game looks... um... interesting...
<Dken2021> I'm not even sure what genre to put it under
<CriticKitten> NiGHTS? Isn't that the game series which has that rather perverted dialogue exchange?
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: What do you mean exactly?
<CriticKitten> "Go on over and touch NiGHTS. You'll see what I mean. That is, of course, if you're interested in that sort of thing...."
<Tovler> Four Lions… Nah, I can see that movies appeal.
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: In fact, this game has little to no dialogue, so I'm assuming you're thinking of a different game.
<CriticKitten> I would suggest a Michael Bay film, but those still have the slightest twinge of enjoyability to them.
<CriticKitten> It needs to be worse.
<Lunar_Brony> CriticKitten explosions and fanservice
<Lunar_Brony> meh
<Tovler> Transformers 2 is pretty close to WMC
<Dr_Fumbles> OH Battlefield Earth!!!
<Dr_Fumbles> Yeah!
<Lunar_Brony> that's a good B movie
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<CriticKitten> While you were still learning to SPELL YOUR NAME~
<Dr_Fumbles> Troll 2?
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<AJIsAwesome> What about Moulin Rough?
*CriticKitten flails his paw about, to go along with that line.
<AJIsAwesome> *Rogue
<Dr_Fumbles> Catwoman
*Dr_Fumbles shudders
<CriticKitten> The Halle Barry one?
<Tovler> hm, Melancholia (I love that movie)
<Lunar_Brony> Dr_Fumbles that's only B because you can make of it (ie OH MY GOOOOOOOOOD)
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome guilty pleasure
<Dr_Fumbles> ^
<Dr_Fumbles> oops
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: So not really a B movie?
<CriticKitten> I was originally picking MegaPirahna as my B.
<Lunar_Brony> meh, haven't seen all of it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Screw it...I'll practice another time ><
<Herostar> IMPORTANT NEWS BULLETIN~ GREAT NEWS! skype has adressed and came up with a solution to the virus! d8ffcbcd6cf38337c49fb81a61321b5e follow the steps on this forum posted by skype to fix the issue!
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: MOO!
<Herostar> crap not a link
<Dr_Fumbles> Any Uwe Boll movie
<Lunar_Brony> ?
<Herostar> http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows/Skype-spam-virus/m-p/1092504#M82322 THIS is the solution, sorry bout tht
<CriticKitten> Eh, those are bad, but still not WMC bad. Which is sort of surprising.
<sonicdude558> GOD THE RESTARTS
<CriticKitten> o.O
<Dr_Fumbles> Here is the ultimate bas movie
<Tovler> Uwe Boll's Rampage was a pretty mean spirited movie… and the only Boll movie I've ever seen

*Dr_Fumbles dies at mention of movie
<CriticKitten> Tovler's original idea was worse.
<PonyNegZero> Herostar: I'll send that to my friend. The other solution is having images of one's computer, but who does that? (other than computer engineers)
<CriticKitten> 'ey Tov, we should both start voting that one.
<Dr_Fumbles> Then You should all see it again...
*Tovler is watching said movie right now
<Dr_Fumbles> You are a brave person
<CriticKitten> You poor soul

<Spell-of-Gaming> For some reason, the last Nintendo Direct a few hours ago seemed REALLY short.
<Rustymeat> Oh Vampires kiss is eligible to rewatched....
<sonicdude558> The blurryness of the stream makes the game look more realistic :)

<twilight_sprinkle> tsk-tsk soulrider95 , no linking non-image links during stream! you should be ashamed!
<sub06905|TARDIS> If you ask for ponies expect to get these kind of ponies: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ur341Y6L1qdfw74.gif
*sonicdude558 has no money, but wants to purchase tshirts from welovefine
<soulrider95> but rules!

*sub06905|TARDIS knows the G3 theme and regrets nothing

<rainbow100> hm oh :P
<Dj_Cyber-4G> break
<Ponies47> This is a word of advice for the new ponies here http://ponies47.deviantart.com/#/d5gwcet :)

<sub06905|TARDIS> so when did sonic learn to fly?
<sub06905|TARDIS> wait...
<rainbow100> I dont know whats goin on in this colorful game
<twilight_sprinkle> its probably the elongated limbs and their looseness
<soulrider95> http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw595_the_dungeon-_n1296531549726_.png
<Phase4> 00,02urgh

<twilight_sprinkle> le wild Phase4 appeared. wild Phase4 used frustration!
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Phase4.
<sonicdude558> yo Phase4 whats with the + instead of a @
*Phase4 00,02hugs PonyNegZero back
<soulrider95> twilight_sprinkle: This is how I see your face when I linked to the rules: http://i49.tinypic.com/xdi6wy.png
<Phase4> 00,02sonicdude558, i smell a new person
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yes, new persons.
<sonicdude558> I have been here for months
<Phase4> 00,02sonicdude558, + meens voice, i can talk when the channel is muted, @ meens op
<sonicdude558> ok
<sonicdude558> I get it
<twilight_sprinkle> soulrider95: nah its more like this http://arch.413chan.net/1288859782062.jpg
<sub06905|TARDIS> Phase4 has a + because @ is to main stream
<sonicdude558> so voice chat over ip?
<sonicdude558> That kind of thing?
<sonicdude558> OH
<Spell-of-Gaming> Uh...
<soulrider95> ah I see
<sonicdude558> nvm
<Phase4> 00,02sonicdude558, mute meens +m, its a channel mode
<rainbow100> i take it this is the only thing streaming right now?
<twilight_sprinkle> + means hes good at math, and/or a swiss
<AJIsAwesome> Yep. :)
<sonicdude558> When some ass mutes the chat, you can still talk
<sonicdude558> ok
<Phase4> 00,02when the channel is muted only those exempt from the mute can talk
<Spell-of-Gaming> Phase4's Perfect Math Class
<sonicdude558> I hate it when people mute the chat during an intermission
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<pony_8204> Im going to come back in a few hours gonna go on youtube:)
<alexxm> don't you just hate it when you book a driving lesson and the guy doesn't even turn up
<Dj_Cyber-4G> who is streaming
<Phase4> 00,02sonicdude558, they do that so they can talk without spam :P
<sonicdude558> SuperBrony64:
<Dj_Cyber-4G> ok
<Buytoast> sometimes you creatures need to be muted
<twilight_sprinkle> its like that joke Federer made at an interview. he was asked whats a good thing about living in Switzerland, he said "Well, the flag is a big plus"
<sub06905|TARDIS> dem a's
<Phase4> 00,02thats why they only lock this room, you can still talk in side rooms
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, I'm buying your Metro 2033 and you're going to play this awesome game damnit. XD
<AdamTheDuck> you*
<Phase4> 00,02wait what?
<soulrider95> I really need to buy a bigger computer case TT_TT
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DARN
<soulrider95> Phase4: Metro 2033 is Fallout, but linear, in russia, with scary stuff.
<Mr_Anybody> Mr Anybody in the house tonight!
*sonicdude558 falls asleep to the results music
<rainbow100> was this game made by the same people who made bomberman?
<sub06905|TARDIS> we all know Phase4 wants everypony to buy Deus Ex, NOW :<
<SuperBrony64> 11,02No, it was made by the same people who made Sonic.
<sonicdude558> "I'm taking a dump... YEAH!"
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, if what soulrider95 says is true, might not enjoy that
<Phase4> 00,02sub06905|TARDIS, INDEED
<sonicdude558> lol in the background
<Buytoast> hudson made bomberman you putz
<Buytoast> sega made NiGHTS
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, damn... :<
<rainbow100> oh ok
<soulrider95> Phase4: it takes quite a beefy computer to run above minimum though.
<Spell-of-Gaming> That "Sonic" on the highscore board would've been obvious.
<Phase4> 00,02world needs more games like deus ex, games that don't stop you from doing something just because its pointless and/or silly
<sub06905|TARDIS> so a computer made of beef then?
<AdamTheDuck> Seems legit ^
<Buytoast> ah yes, day sex
<Phase4> 00,02BEEFPUTER
<Buytoast> the game where you can avoid being seen by jumping across vents
<soulrider95> I only use lean beef for me graphics
<sonicdude558> Good night guise
<sonicdude558> :)
<sub06905|TARDIS> bai sonicdude558

<sonicdude558> Bye
<sub06905|TARDIS> tis be a 3 day weekend :3
<alexxm> don't you just hate it when you book a driving lesson and the guy doesn't even turn up
<soulrider95> I got two GPU's and metro 2033 still runs only at 60FPS on normal settings :/
<Spell-of-Gaming> http://i.imgur.com/d5OQH.jpg
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, it's "scarey" yes, but it's not jump from nowhere shit your pants scare, it's more like waves of mutant rats charging at your rail while having the game intentionally give you low ammo scarey. :P
<sub06905|TARDIS> i have a felling SuperBrony64 is trying to get this perfect
<sub06905|TARDIS> feeling*
<PonyNegZero> sub06905|TARDIS: what gave it away?
<soulrider95> Well its more of a atmpospheric scary, like the shining, not jump scares, but slowly scare you and creepy
<Dj_Cyber-4G> WTF IS HAPPENING
<alexxm> i have no idea
<PonyNegZero> john madden, that is all.
<sub06905|TARDIS> PonyNegZero: well he is restarting the dream alot, but that doesnt mean anything >_>
<Spell-of-Gaming> Drugs
<Spell-of-Gaming> are happening
<Dj_Cyber-4G> AAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!
<soulrider95> Anypony have a good tower case recommendation? My midtower is a little cramped for my computer.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> ANNOYANCE
<CrystalShard> wtf is this game :/
<Dj_Cyber-4G> WHY!!!!
<sub06905|TARDIS> why cant my dreams be more like this, and not Scream singing the theme to The suite life of zack and cody?
<sub06905|TARDIS> ...
<Rustymeat> so whats up with this boss?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
*Dj_Cyber-4G rips hair out

<sub06905|TARDIS> ello Scottish-geeky
<Scottish-geeky> AdamTheDuck: tab fail
<twilight_sprinkle> say Phase4 do you kno the difference between fail() and eof() in c++ file reading?
<AJIsAwesome> HI, Scottish-geeky :)
<Scottish-geeky> hai sub06905|TARDIS
<Scottish-geeky> hi AJIsAwesome
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Scottish-geeky
<Scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: ello mate
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Guess I'll just practice at it later >>
<twilight_sprinkle> Scottish-geeky: how are ye
<sub06905|TARDIS> OI, your mums a slag
<Dj_Cyber-4G> OK THATS IT
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, eof() meens that the end of the file has been reached or the eof character has been found, depending on mode, fail() indicates a stream failure and is not implyed by eof()
<Scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: im good
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: hm ok thx, then this class example really isnt right then..
<SuperBrony64> 11,02#34 isn't bad for now...I guess >>
<twilight_sprinkle> 34
<twilight_sprinkle> wat a number
<PonyNegZero> SuperBrony64 is best rule 34
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, your trying to check if you can read the file right?
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, dat channel advertising
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Phase4: O U
<Scottish-geeky> Ponies47: ello mate
<Ponies47> Ohai Scottish-geeky
<Ninjazz> GASP.
<Ninjazz> SuperBrony64!
<Ninjazz> YOU'RE SUPERBRONY64!!!
<Dj_Cyber-4G> he is streaming
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: yeah, but for some reason in the class example its if (!fin.eof()) {output error}, but that would be the case opposite of a mistake it would seem to me
<Scottish-geeky> Ponies47: i have seen your work on DA it very awesome
<Ninjazz> I missed this nick. T__T
<Ponies47> Scottish-geeky: Thanks. I try to do my best :$
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, what you want is !fin.good()
<Phase4> 00,02.good() checks the eof fail and bad bit
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: yeah thats what i thought, i guess this example is wrong then
<Scottish-geeky> Ponies47: lol
<twilight_sprinkle> thanks Phase4 :)
<Phase4> 00,02np ^_^

<Scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: what is kelvins
<Ninjazz> Sometimes... I dream about cheese.
<twilight_sprinkle> Scottish-geeky: the metric system unit for temperature. its the best measuring scale because 0 kelvin is lowest possible temperature, aka absolute zero
<PonyNegZero> I have this dream where I drink tea and type stuff into my computer all night... oh wait, it's 3:10 and I'm still here...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02gg :)

<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: and fidel castro!
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, protip: flock() is useless, it silently blocks on windows (which is unfortunately a concern) and may fail on threaded servers as they share the same lock, and LOCK_EX doesnt block LOCK_SH so too much contention can prevent LOCK_EX from ever returning (my current dilema)
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, and his strapping brother.
<Scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: what
<richfiles> Dang... I finally get Windows XP Pro installed on my computer, and now It seems I've lost my files from my old computer. :'(
<Scottish-geeky> Ninjazz: just saying
<Ninjazz> Scottish-geeky, I know. Replying in a similar manner.
<twilight_sprinkle> Scottish-geeky: you have sinned, you have mentioned gangnam..
<Ninjazz> Oppan.
<Scottish-geeky> Ninjazz: ok
<Ninjazz> Gundam Style.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: did you know fidel castro once swam naked through a bay at night, that was known to be infested with sharks with a machine gun on his back?
<Scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: the sinn is looked over when Doctor who is involed
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: he was swimming to punish you for saying gangnam!
<Scottish-geeky> *over looked
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, so that's who that was...
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: interesting - I might do more research and look into that, but it is 3:14am, I have a big day tomor...today, I have a lab due in <24 hours and I'm probably already ded...
<twilight_sprinkle> 3:14 am
<twilight_sprinkle> perfect math time!
<Ninjazz> That explains the cigar.

<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, don't stress yourself, i have a hack solution but i'm trying to avoid that
<PonyNegZero> twilight_sprinkle: fair enough, but the math tends to be rather easy (if the physics is set up right)
<Ninjazz> Heeeeeeeyyyyyy, Fidel Castro.

<Scottish-geeky> PonyNegZero: to make you ask quistions
<AdamTheDuck> PonyNegZero, because ponies.
<d3rb> because alcohol
<twilight_sprinkle> PonyNegZero: when i was in a dorm, my roommates played games loudly until 5-6 am and slept during the day
<twilight_sprinkle> and i had 8.30 am classes.
<Scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: you roommates sound like me
<alexxm> so next weeks movies seem like they should be good

<PonyNegZero> twilight_sprinkle: there was a guy playing electric guitar at 3am last night
<Scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: ah lawls
<twilight_sprinkle> PonyNegZero: for the first month we had some morons who kept playing dubstep all day
<twilight_sprinkle> played during the night as wel
<twilight_sprinkle> it was not a fun dorm
<TerraFirma_Alt> the end level replay for this is gonna be naaaasty
<PonyNegZero> twilight_sprinkle: oh, that happens all day every day here - I can hear the bass through cinder-block walls
<Moopy> sounds like there having a party over there
<twilight_sprinkle> and one of my roommates kept taking my food, and he kept setting the ac to 10 degrees celsius before going to bed...
<Scottish-geeky> Away in a madhouse Confined to my bed,From visions and nightmares That filled me with dread,The doctor has sweetly Inserted a probe,To severe completely My prefrontal lobe. Electroshock therapy Mind-numbing pills,They change my behavior To cure all my ills,I love the asylum My own padded cell, I'll stay here forever, For outside it's hell!
<PonyNegZero> I love when people don't even bother to shut their doors when they have the stereos blasting (yes, stereos in dorm rooms)
<TerraFirma_Alt> Have a marry solithists everyone :D
<TerraFirma_Alt> have yourself a marry solthstist
<PonyNegZero> twilight_sprinkle: lucky - you have AC

<AdamTheDuck> Ooh a new person?
<AdamTheDuck> So many new people nowadays
<twilight_sprinkle> the worst thing about fahrenheit, is that its not even a constant difference from kelvin/celsius, its some stupid thing like 5/9-273.15 to get from fahrenheit to kelvin or vce versa
<carder52> e-yup.
<twilight_sprinkle> *5/9x-273.15

<NENUDJUS> Mr_Anybody: If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α because of the bisection, and CAB = α because of the similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the original isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.Suppos

<DaringDerpy> good afternoon my little bronies
<Mr_Anybody> ew
<NENUDJUS> no
*Jmo slaps DaringDerpy around a bit with a large trout
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DaringDerpy
<Jmo> FESSHY
<Mr_Anybody> that just sounded wrong
<cowvarkian> I've heard worst
<DaringDerpy> not the trout!
<Mr_Anybody> i've heard nothing but my brain tired
<Lil_B> hello DaringDerpy
<NENUDJUS> Mr_Anybody: If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α because of the bisection, and CAB = α because of the similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the original isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.Suppos
<NENUDJUS> blinded with math!

<AdamTheDuck> lol XD
<Daygon> will not scream but loud enough
<Ninjazz> What you should have showed him your fan art. Then he would have said "You'll never get my respect back".
<Vordox> So...
<JRP> Holy crap they made that 6 yr old in the ad say "well fuck me"
<Vordox> Wrek, wanna show something? :P I'm bored, perhaps a few drawings!
<Daygon> He knows about this website
<AdamTheDuck> Daygon
<AdamTheDuck> He knows too much
<Daygon> and he knows about this placce showing movies and episodes of different shows
<AdamTheDuck> You must dispose of him quickly~
<Ninjazz> This place is rather non-pony actually.
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Ninjazz> One of the lesser brony fansites.
<Daygon> Cuz we watched some many pirate of carribean
<Ninjazz> Which I LIKE.

<Invi> indeed Ninjazz
<Daygon> and he came it at the part when Cranky was getting angry at Pinkie
<Daygon> and him yelling at Pinkie
<Ninjazz> Ohhh, the drama part.
<Invi> I don't like pople being too obsessed with omne thing...
<Ninjazz> Invi, like me with Rarity? :<
*Jmo slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout

<Jmo> Woop woop.
*Jmo slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
<AdamTheDuck> Daygon, because he isn't the hero BronyState needs

*Daygon grabs the derringer from the floor and hits Ryunosuke with it.
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.

<Chrysalis> NENUDJUS what do you think job-seekers and dole is
<NENUDJUS> so tax the 1.30 by 14%
<Chrysalis> so few of them actually try
<Chrysalis> there are some that do
<Invi> DaringDerpy, that were UK gallons you measured in ^^
<Chrysalis> but most just sit on their ass and do nothing as workers pay for it
<DaringDerpy> they should switch to decent units
<NENUDJUS> Chrysalis: very small %

<Sonny> >_>
<Sonny> <_<
<Lil_B> NENUDJUS I know, I am fully adult, but my current situation woukldn't alklow that, maybe after I wqorked or a few years and lay some money to the side, than it'
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, It's just like necromancy... Only with homicidal robots.~
<LoGaN> guys i got all 52 episodes of mlp on itunes
<Lil_B> it's pssoble, that's what I ment
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: Phew. I thought 2K finally lost their minds and gave it only to America.
<Invi> everything is possible
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: ya maybe then
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, what do you think of Dishonored?
<Invi> we have a town that only consists of 3-5 houses Lil_B ^^
<AdamTheDuck> CrimsonPhoenix, really there isn't any gameplay video of yet I think

<superDERP> okay....:(
<CrimsonPhoenix> Minecraft players http://youtu.be/hLNnZVxjfQc this must now be played in the background when you play the game
<AdamTheDuck> Most games today tend to go for the action-stealth approach...
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, good point
<Lil_B> NENUDJUS yeah :) I just have one question about Politics...
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll still buy it
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: ye?

<Sumica> 00,10either way it replaces the one I lost at work
<Bogy> yay
<superDERP> yay...
<mentallyeffedguy> whats the yaying?
<Braviary> Almost every time I come on, it's either Spacecraft, or one of the streamers playing a video game. I know those things have their fans and I'm not going to bash them, but, NENUDJUS, it's just not my thing. So when I check, and they have ponies, it's a happy thing.
<JunkerKun> Sumica: Ah, so you already had one
<DaringDerpy> not bad, Sumica
<Ninjazz> Haven't seen Woona or Fluer in the other corner for some time.
<Sumica> 00,10had a psp till a month ago

<pinkiespice> Sumica: ;A;
<Ponies47> Ohai Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10all i have is patapon cause downloaded
<NENUDJUS> Braviary: you know a out a little joke on it like you come to BRONY sit for ponys you know
<Bogy> what is this song?^^
<thelonepony> which one Sumica ?
<Sumica> 00,102
<Lil_B> I've never actually watched Ghostebuster fully, but I know that the Yu Gi Oh Movie is nice to riff about :)
<J_E_Smith71> Funny we're seeing Baby Cakes clips. That's one of today's eps coming up I think
<DocSane> Yugioh in all its forms is awful.
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: do you have steam?
<mentallyeffedguy> eat shit you homosexual toad
<Lil_B> NENUDJUS yes
<Ninjazz> So this video is kinda what you're feeling atm?
<J_E_Smith71> DocSane: Yeah but it's still as fun as hell to riff
<mentallyeffedguy> thats the best insult ever
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but it's fun to make fun of awful
<thelonepony> mentallyeffedguy wat?
<Braviary> NENUDJUS, I don't understand that sentence.
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: is it same name?
<J_E_Smith71> That
<NENUDJUS> Braviary: cuz im dumb
<DocSane> J_E_Smith71: I don't understand how kids would genuinely like that show.
<superDERP> steak!
<Braviary> Pills here!
<J_E_Smith71> That's why I voted not to have it WMC'd simply because the chat riffs are fun
<Lil_B> NENUDJUS no, currently it's... wait, I have to check XD
<Kinixys> Your pony wants steak!
*pinkiespice pulls his cart filled with pills
<mentallyeffedguy> Braviary: where is that from? "pills here"
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: :P
<Braviary> It's from L4D.
<DaringDerpy> heavy rain outside :)
<pinkiespice> come get your pills here. ;d
<DocSane> Meanwhile, Luna just snoozes the day away.
<Braviary> Love this one.
<DaringDerpy> vision range is less than 1000m
<Lil_B> DaringDerpy get a copy, it's fun to play
<pinkiespice> whats from l4d?
<Sylandest> welp
<Braviary> The "Pills here!" quote, pinkiespice.
<alexxm> a wild pinkie pie appeared
<pinkiespice> oh
<Ninjazz> Still a little odded out that it's Pinkie Pie and not Rainbow Dash.
<Sylandest> i remember this vid, was supposed to be good
<Sylandest> lol
<Ninjazz> because they're usually paired.
<superDERP> applejack!
<Vordox> Smile SMILE SMILE!
<DaringDerpy> Lil_B: I think I saw this game played here. Not so interesting
<Bogy> xD
<pinkiespice> ....
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<mentallyeffedguy> LOL
<Ninjazz> Love this already.
<thelonepony> Lol
<superDERP> this is my jam!
<NENUDJUS> Invi: do you have steam?
<Lil_B> What others think "Man there are Ponys in this Video" what Bronys think "Why is Scout with Pinkie Pie and not with Rainbow Dash"
<Sylandest> the silliness of this video
<Sumica> 00,10dem teath
<mentallyeffedguy> greatest thing EVER
<Sylandest> it pleases me
<J_E_Smith71> Wait, why did they use the actual Smile song? There's a Pyro parody of his called Fire Fire Fire
<alexxm> medic's pinkie?
*pinkiespice makes note to play some l4d today
<J_E_Smith71> Oh wait
<Braviary> Ninjazz, Scout is a joking kind of guy who breaks the fourth wall. I know it's not as common as Scout and Dash, but I've seen enough of Scout with Pinkie that it's not an oddity.
<J_E_Smith71> Didn't notice it was Medic instead of Pyro
*pinkiespice corrects it makes it L4d2
<Braviary> Besides, who else would appear in a confetti explosion?
<Braviary> pinkiespice, it wasn't in the first one?
<CrimsonPhoenix> what would make this video more awesome is a fan voice for medic singing the smile song
<Ninjazz> Braviary, I'm just saying that /I/ think it's odd to see.
<Lil_B> NENUDJUS yes, my name is Lil'B there too, I think I changed it a month ago
<pinkiespice> the pills here was in the first
<Lil_B> Vordox I have a question
<Sumica> 00,10give it time CrimsonPhoenix
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: ill add you :P
<pinkiespice> but they also have the first map and charaters in the second one too
<Kinixys> Some tf2 servers should be this happy.
<Braviary> That Pyro has a break smile.
<Lil_B> NENUDJUS ok :)
<GreasyEthan> Mornig.
<CrimsonPhoenix> seriously medic's accent in this would be hilarious
<GreasyEthan> *Morning.
<superDERP> i want to get this game sooo bad, but my computer is crap :P
<AdamTheDuck> Hello GreasyEthan
<J_E_Smith71> Someone needs to do a Pyro vid since they already have a parody of that out
<mentallyeffedguy> please let this go on forever!
<CrimsonPhoenix> and this is where the guy got lazy
<mentallyeffedguy> ¨
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: what is your pic?
<Sumica> 00,10some realy good wirk with sfm in this too
<Mega_Milk> This video makes me appreciate the high five taunt 5 times more.
<pinkiespice> in the land of pinkmina, no one can frown, even when they want to break down and cry
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning everyone. Morning Sumica
<Lil_B> NENUDJUS black and white, with the text under the picture "Like a Boss"
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: sup.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello there ASoftFluffyThing
<Kinixys> pinkiespice: "Happiness is mandatory, citizen."
<Vordox> Yes Lil_B ?
<J_E_Smith71> Derp Face
<Lil_B> NENUDJUS from germany :)
<thelonepony> hi ASoftFluffyThing
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: ok :P
<DerpyMuffins> Dat anal bead
<J_E_Smith71> The Derpy fan's anthem
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GOD YES
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs Mega_Milk, AdamTheDuck, and thelonepony
<Vordox> <3 THIS SONG
<Ninjazz> This ONE. <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> BRONYSTATE NEEDS A HERO
<Sylandest> hehe
<thelonepony> <3
<pinkiespice> Kinixys: anyone not happy will go thourgh reeducaiton to fix it. :D
<Ninjazz> THIIIIIIIIS OOOONEEEE. <3
<DerpyMuffins> This is one of my fav Rarity song
*DaringDerpy applies for heroship
<pinkiespice> manatory reeducation
<Lil_B> Vordox me and some others were asking if we could play Terraria agin, but nobody can make a server :/
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: I bet you would have played that Smile vid last night if you didn't have to abruptly leave right after the ep right?
<Sumica> 00,10I played it before the movies
<J_E_Smith71> Oh
<Vordox> Lil_B: Oh! Well, it's a shame but not sure that's a feasible solution
<Mega_Milk> This reminds me of calling to the night.
<Lil_B> NENUDJUS and done :)
<J_E_Smith71> Well I'm never here before the movies
<Vordox> Just run the Terraria server systme on your computer
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, we didn't get our weekly walk like a jagger video
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: :P you have phse4 as a friend! o.o
<DaringDerpy> J_E_Smith71: most of the time they play fps games.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I know I had to run out before the market closed, had bills to pay
<JunkerKun> CrimsonPhoenix: Weekly.. what? O_o
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: phase4*
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Well that's all right of course
<CrimsonPhoenix> JunkerKun, each time BMN is over Sumica plays a walk like a jaggger video
<Lil_B> Vordox I tried, but my connection isn't good enough, nether is Ghuntlers or Serenitys :( but well, We'll have to try than
<Phase4> Lil_B, does terraria have a dedicated server?
<Ninjazz> YOU'VE BEEN BANNED.
<Sumica> 00,10super was queud up to go after but he was not ready even though he queued up.
<J_E_Smith71> I knew you probably had something important to take care of
<JunkerKun> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh... didn't know that
<Braviary> I thought the song title was Moves Like Jagger.
<Ninjazz> I absolutely love the strings in the part.
<Ninjazz> this part*
<Lil_B> Phase4 I think so, You have to run extra software to make a server, somebody has to be the Host
<DocSane> Rarity looks best when she busts out the Rari-spex.
<Sumica> 00,10you can run a listen server
<CrimsonPhoenix> Braviary, thank you for correcting me
<J_E_Smith71> But anyways me not being here at start of BMN is probably going to change soon after Daylight Savings ends. With the sun setting too early I'll be back home from my walk sooner so I'll be here at the start
<CrimsonPhoenix> I was hesitant of my answer
<Invi> NENUDJUS, yeah, I have steam ^^
<Sumica> 00,10but it's not optmised very well for local conections
<Braviary> No trouble, I actually thought I had it wrong when you said that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> YES
<Sumica> 00,10heare you go
<Mega_Milk> Ehhh....
<DerpyMuffins> Here we go
<Lil_B> Invi do I have you added in Steam?
<Sylandest> I remember this one
<Invi> I dunno, lemme see
<CrimsonPhoenix> Thanks doc sumica
<Phase4> Lil_B, there is a dedicated server but it requires windows, i could try run under wine
<DocSane> Man, what if season 3 is nothing but fan service.
<Buytoast> that would be horrible
<Sumica> 00,10hope not
<Phase4> DocSane, i fear that
<Ninjazz> Wut.
<Mega_Milk> I fear no man
<DocSane> It'll be all Derpy and Trixie and Lyra wanting hands.
<CrimsonPhoenix> season 3 will most likely be more product advertisement
<Mega_Milk> But season 3 full of fan service.....It scares me...
<Lil_B> Phase4 that would be nice, I now we have multiple people here who own this game :)
<Braviary> Well, some of the episodes were written before the brony population reached its high mass, so not all of it would be like that.
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, but that pony... it scares me
<Braviary> Season 4, however...
<ASoftFluffyThing> I've never seen the Lyra of this.
<Lil_B> dat... Plot ... I'm confused
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Ha! this guy knows where i was going.
<Sparkarez> DAT PLOT
<CrimsonPhoenix> This PMV
<Lil_B> I'm Bluie!
<Sylandest> oooh
<Lil_B> Blue*
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, /)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dat ad
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's a pinkie part I love so much
<JunkerKun> So, what B movie will be shown today?
<Ninjazz> Blue.
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: (\
<Ninjazz> Blue everywhere.
<J_E_Smith71> JunkerKun: Yu-Gi-Oh
<Dark92Enigma> JunkerKun: Yu Gi Oh
<DocSane> I wonder how much of season 3 will deal with this Crystal Empire thing.
<CrimsonPhoenix> cross my heart hope tofly
<JunkerKun> J_E_Smith71: O_o
<CrimsonPhoenix> WELP
<J_E_Smith71> JunkerKun: Stay for the chat riffs
<Dark92Enigma> DocSane: Insert Sailor Moon reference
<Invi> Lil_B, NENUDJUS what is ya steamname?
<Lil_B> Invi Lil'B
<NENUDJUS> Lil_B: nenudjus :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> ......wait a second there
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: I thought that was Crystal Tokyo.
<JunkerKun> J_E_Smith71: Oooookay...
<Lil_B> OMG! Farming Simulator 2013!!!
<Sparkarez> Is it true that they will be in Canterlot for the entire season?
<Dark92Enigma> DocSane: After taking a look at the Crystal Empire, it kinda looks that way
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: Where did you "take a look" at the Crystal Empire?
<Lil_B> Sparkarez I have no Idea, but would be a nice change
<NENUDJUS> omfg! 30 ins till MLP FiM is on TV
<Dark92Enigma> DocSane: with the big crystal in the center and all
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: But it would be quite strange change, don't you think?
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: Ah, okay.
<J_E_Smith71> JunkerKun:It was actually voted as a joke, guy didn't know it would really win
<Dark92Enigma> DocSane: i'll PM you, no spoilers allowed
<J_E_Smith71> NENUDJUS: Actually only two
<Kinixys> Maybe it's a 13 part miniseries? O.e
<AdamTheDuck> Dat pole dancin'

<CrimsonPhoenix> by I guess they just experimented with the hues of the main to make up the pegasus twins
<Lil_B> Mis.*
<Litwick> You people honestly dont know how genes can work right?
<Dark92Enigma> CM PUNK to Mrs. Cake: YOU'RE A WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Hes pony is best pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh boy
<Lil_B> Sumica this is waht all true Warriors strive for!
<DocSane> Litwick: Someone drew up a chart explaining pony genetics.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I had a picture about gene study in MLP
<Chrysalis> thing is, that assumed that earth pony is the dominant gene
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Hoe*

<JRP2234> mica why hub logo
<Mega_Milk> kirzstryfe: Sup.
<Litwick> Mr Cake's a ninja.
<J_E_Smith71> JRP2234: Cause it's a live Hub stream
<DocSane> They're leaking sarin gas again.
<Sumica> 00,10because live eps
<Dark92Enigma> FINE.........yeah sure
<DerpyMuffins> Get Maxthon 3, it has adblock+ already instealled
<Mega_Milk> Mr.Cake is so MLG
<Litwick> And so is Ms Cake.\
<DocSane> Anyone else think that the Cakes are cousins to the Pies?
<Braviary> This episode contradicts canon, that's not how babies walked in Newborn Cuties.
<ASoftFluffyThing> DocSane, what makes you say that?
<DocSane> And that Pinkie lives there because she's a relative?
<Mega_Milk> Not unless you think Peachy Pie is a lost pie sister.
<DocSane> Cake is similar to Pie.
<J_E_Smith71> Pound Cake should be able to pound things, it's his name
<Mega_Milk> Lies
<DerpyMuffins> Cake and Pie are different
<Litwick> ...Clever girl DocSane.
<Mega_Milk> ^
<Sumica> 00,10nah Braviary, just mrs cake was standing in the way of the rainbows
<DocSane> I'm thinking of how the Oranges were aunt and unlce to the Apples.
<Ponies47> Pick me!
<J_E_Smith71> Nah screw Angel
<Dark92Enigma> FORGET ANGEL
<Jerry> Hellbunny
<DaringDerpy> fluttershy...
<Litwick> YO DOG I HERD YOU LIKE REPORTS
<ASoftFluffyThing> J_E_Smith71, and then he takes Pound Cake literally when he's a teenager
<Braviary> Nom.
<pinkiespice> applejack seems the most important
<Ponies47> Gotta "Dash"...
<pinkiespice> rarity left
<Ponies47> (Rimshot)
*Mega_Milk is swarming on this toast

<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> cant*
<Sumica> 00,10they are true, becarefull in the labrynths
<Invi> I guess it's diplomaplease dot com
<Litwick> My headcanon for why Scootaloo cant fly is that she has a disability.
<Litwick> Her wings being too small for her body.
<Blako> hi
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> or she is part chicken lol
<Sumica> 00,10had a dude throw a potato at me
<Flyboy> pinkie is ok as a babysitter, but she needs to learn to accept help. wait a sec.. wasnt that is episode 4? silly pinkie, should've listened.
<DocSane> I'm not saying Scoots can't fly at all, but she'll never be fast or strong.
<Dark92Enigma> Scootaloo doesn't know how to fly because SHE KEEPS BEATING HER WINGS AS FAST AS SHE CAN

<pony_300> 5d's was the last time I think they were actually trying
<CriticKitten> Heart of the Cards? You mean cheating right?
<pankreas> bonjour everypony!

<Lil_B> hello pankreas
<pony_300> Dken2021: to rehash the first series in the worst way possible.
<Meanwhile> It was never supposed to be. But then it was.

<Saigneur> pankreas are you french ?
<Saigneur> hi pankreas
<pankreas> no
<Saigneur> too bad

<Kencolt> CriticKitten: It's not cheating. It's Yugi's natural talent to pull an impossible cardout of his ass from nowhere to win. He's got a duel monsters deck cutie mark on his but to prove it.
<sub06905|TARDIS> dat spam
<Dken2021> ...yea, none of that please
<Saigneur> why everypony say Bonjour/salut ????

<Brownclown> I've never seen this, I'm a terrible person
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: I never understood what it was with the fire.
<pinkiespice> cuddly_kittehs: thanks for voluenteering. :D
*pinkiespice sets cuddly_kittehs on fire. :D
*cuddly_kittehs runs in a circle, screaming, as the heat sears flesh from bone
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: It's fire, what's to understand? It burns things and goes WOOOOOOOSH.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 enough
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no RP in the channel
<pinkiespice> its now rule?
<SirGanjalf> yeah, don't play with fire on public channels
<cuddly_kittehs> XD
<pankreas> RP?
<SirGanjalf> it's dangerous
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's ALWAYS been a rule -_-
<AJIsAwesome> If you want to RP cuddly_kittehs and pinkiespice, please PM each other. :)
<Dken2021> pinkiespice it's been that way
<pankreas> what does RP mean?
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Aye but why do warriors get it. It just seemed like they were short on ideas and had to throw it in there.
<pinkiespice> not even a little rpg? for less than a mintue?
<Bogy> sorry but what is RP
<Bogy> xD
<AJIsAwesome> pankreas: Role Playing.
<Bogy> oh okay
<pinkiespice> Dken2021: oh
<pankreas> -.-
<pankreas> :D
<SirGanjalf> Pony being on the other hand...
<Bogy> discord slime!
<cuddly_kittehs> Normally, I haven't been shunned for a little bit of RP that suits the moment. Then again.....that was random
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I think warriors don't have any other major form of burning.
<AJIsAwesome> That's not ectoplasm.....;)
<drphantom> OMG IT's...um nevermind
<Dark92Enigma-> Is Movie night on?
<pony_300> ectoplasmic residue.... these days, we call it "protien"
<cuddly_kittehs> Bogy: "Roleplay"
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma-: Yes.
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: True but it's not like rifles have obligatory freezing ability.
<Saigneur> wow
<Dark92Enigma-> AJIsAwesome: Not for me.........blame my mom, and this browser
<cuddly_kittehs> But that would be a gr
<pony_300> the rapidfire dings scurred me more than the bookshelf
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: True enough, still I think it works quite well.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma-: Ah.
<Dken2021> still dead in here eh? oh well
<Brownclown> ding ding ding! We have a winner!
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma-: Yes it is
<CriticKitten> Device has the weirdest boner
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Oh definitely, it's a good thing to have I just never really understood it.
<drphantom> This movie used to scare me when I was little.
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeaaaaaaaad.
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma-: You made it, just 15 mins late
<DerpyMuffins> lol
<Dark92Enigma-> AJIsAwesome: the only hope i have left is restart the computer, and then come back later J_E_Smith71
<SirGanjalf> Wow, what cloudburst at my place. Kinda appripriate for a movie about ghosts...
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma-: I wish you the best of luck. :)
<Dark92Enigma-> J_E_Smith71: I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING, because of my browser
<Amu-chan> Going to be idle for a bit, later!
<SirGanjalf> shhhhhh...
<RainbowAsh> Dark92Enigma-, what are you using?
<Cades> cya
<drphantom> shhhhhhhhhhhh
<Meanwhile> Librarian ghost is reading, do not interrupt.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I dunno. Other weapons tend to revolve a lot around other conditions and whatnot. My sword is very bleed-favoring.
<pony_7901> shhhhhhhhhhh
<SirGanjalf> drphantom: yeah, especially next scene
<Azuredragon> Get her!
<Kencolt> The...usual stuff?
<SirGanjalf> :O
<pinkiespice> i would have asked her for a book
<Bogy> :o
<pony_300> ghost just wants to read a book, leave it alone
<pinkiespice> or a recommendation
<J_E_Smith71> drphantom: Me too, I liked the cartoon and sequel, but this one always scared me more it was years before I could watch it
<Dark92Enigma-> RainbowAsh: The Latest Internet Explorer........i don't remind the number
<Soulero> when did susan boyle star in ghostbusters?
<SirGanjalf> "QUIET!"
<Ryunosuke> ghost twily?
<Azuredragon> Best laid planes
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Aye sword stacks bleed by default, greatsword has armour break, I forget what the others do off hand.
<Soulero> they touched it sooo hard
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma-: Is the stream loading at all? Do you have the Lime V screen? Maybe you need to press play
<brony_90> i bought the game from this movie for Pc, but i didnt check if my Computer is good enough for this... now i have a game i cant play...
<cuddly_kittehs> Ryunosuke: T_T Twilight is not dead. It is a Twilight Hologram clone!
<Saigneur> aaaaaah
<J_E_Smith71> brony_90: Same thing happened to me
<Dark92Enigma-> J_E_Smith71: i'm still having the ''WE ARE DOING MAINTENANCE''
<Dken2021> brony_90 you could always download it again after you get a brand spanking new beast of a PC
<Azuredragon> brony_90, thats what consoles are for
<Dark92Enigma-> RainbowAsh Internet Explorer 7
<EspyLacopa> So, we showing regular Pyramid of Light today, or the abridged version?
<Saigneur> Dark92Enigma-: clear the cache
<Dark92Enigma-> RainbowAsh: are you using Mozilla
<RainbowAsh> Dark92Enigma-, ah, I see. Yes, I am, how do you know?
<Meanwhile> No idea.
<Dken2021> dunno, was it ever voted for WMC?
<Dark92Enigma-> Saigneur: To Quote Christopher Lloyd:-----HOW?
<Dken2021> I know there were votes
<Meanwhile> It's not marked for WMC.
<SirGanjalf> Dark92Enigma-: try direct link
<Meanwhile> But that could just be the list not yet updated.
<Dark92Enigma-> RainbowAsh: my mom told me, it's the best and safest browser there is
<Saigneur> i dunno, CCleaner for example ^^'
<Meanwhile> Hey Val was Pyramid of Light WMC'd or not?
<Soulero> ghostbusters: teh disney musical
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: The sword/axe combo is a real gem.
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma-: Don't you have a Clear History thing that can do it>
<J_E_Smith71> Meanwhile: Nope
<Saigneur> I HAVE NO IDEA
<RainbowAsh> Dark92Enigma-, I do agree with her.
<Dark92Enigma-> J_E_Smith71: i'll try it
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Axe builds the adrenaline fast, the sword stacks bleed like crazy. It's golden. :3
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: It never looks like it's hitting with the offhand unless you use abilities, I find it rather offputting for dual wield.
<Ryunosuke> RAY, NOT HELPING!

<Saigneur> OP OP OP

<Saigneur> OPPA GANGNAM STYLE
<Lil_B> what? No Elevator Music?
<SteveCharb> puff.... seriously?
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Combustiblelemons> there may be a ghost busters 3 if anyone's interested.
<BladedWings|Away> man they are trigger happy lol
<LordDerpington> IKR, he had that crazy pompadour.
<CrimsonPhoenix> What came first about Ghostbuster?
<Dark92Enigma-> MAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIID
<Bogy> :D
<Fl00t4hSh41> Take that you filthy maid!
<Meanwhile> Sorry we shot you with lasers.
<Sundaysmile> NO LEMON PLEDGE!!!!
<otakon> TRIVIA! They didn't tell her about the explosives inher cart.
<Dark92Enigma-> Well not as scary as CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
<SirGanjalf> "We thought you were a ghost maid"
<Fl00t4hSh41> Thats what I think about the room service!
<J_E_Smith71> And the maid would later sue them, according to the game
<Kencolt> Wait. No-one had ever INVENTED or evenPOSTULATED a Nuclear Accellerator before. SO WHY WOULD THEY NEED A LICENCE?
<Sonny> Nail... NAAAAAIIIL
<SteveCharb> such an incredible line
<pony_300> okaton: seriously?
<Soulero> such as which the police would pull you over and say "sir do you have a licence for the nuclear accelerator?" and they would pull out an instantly recognisable nuclear accelerator license
<Azuredragon> Slimer!
<Brownclown> nomnomnomnom
<Dark92Enigma-> Ghost Maid LOL
<bashful> ew
<Dark92Enigma-> SLIMER!
<BladedWings|Away> daaaaaw aint he cuuuuute
<SirGanjalf> Venkman, i saw him, i saw him!
<Saigneur> nomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnom
<SteveCharb> Slimer is John Belushi's ghost
<bashful> lol
<J_E_Smith71> Peter: "You shoot a proton stream at somebody and they get all sue happy! We didn't even burn her! There was some redness, some redness."
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kencolt: The weapons grade plutonium that powers the proton packs?
<Soulero> where the hell does the food go?
<Brownclown> Pewpewpew
<Soulero> maybe, to the portal fridge?
<Soulero> bazing
<bashful> lol poke
<Dark92Enigma-> NOW YOU'RE THINKING
<LordDerpington> It goes through him, you see it.
<SirGanjalf> SteveCharb: Wasn't John Belushi still alive in 1984?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> Hi everypony
<Dark92Enigma-> WITH PORTALS
<Bogy> kill it with fire!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ankano_BrOnyxia. :)
<BladedWings|Away> hi Ankano_BrOnyxia
<Kotano> SirGanjalf I think he died in 81 or 82
<SteveCharb> SirGanjalf: lemme check, because I know that for a fact
<Combustiblelemons> yes ray, this is dog.
<Azuredragon> Run
<SirGanjalf> AARGGHHUUUUUAAAAAAHHHHHHH
<Meanwhile> And then it hurt him.
<Dark92Enigma-> COME ON, AND PLAY
<otakon> yeah won't hurt you
<Soulero> and then totally ironically it hurts him
<drphantom> :O
<otakon> scare the HELL out of you though
<otakon> not really
<SirGanjalf> "He slimed me."
<bashful> he slimed me..
<CrimsonPhoenix> he got sliiiiiimed
<Bogy> :D
<LordDerpington> Ghost bukkakke
<Azuredragon> Thats great!
<DerpyMuffins> I got slimed
<ShiningDawn> dat slim
<drphantom> :D
<Dark92Enigma-> HE SLIMED ME :D
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: Not unless you count Slimed as hurt
<Soulero> sexiest scene in the film
<otakon> Fl00t4hSh41: doesn't count as hurt
<Dark92Enigma-> SOOOOOOOO WRONG
<Brownclown> Maaaaaaaaaaaaaan I'm so high right now
<otakon> just...startled
<bashful> save some for me
<Kotano> "He slimed me" would be a great tagline for a ghostbusters porn parody...
<Brownclown> I feel soooooo funky
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: Could be toxic slime
<Kotano> Is there a Ghostbusters parody?
<Lil_B> is that Cleese?
<BladedWings|Away> Kotano: :D
<SirGanjalf> The goggles, they do something!
<Barbetos> Lil_B no
<Soulero> Kotano: how did you read my script?
<Dark92Enigma-> Soulero: second one IMO
<Lil_B> Barbetos he kinda looked like him :/
<Barbetos> He is not in this movie, or atleast not credited as having been in it.
<Soulero> Dark92Enigma-: well, thats a matter of opinion
<bashful> lol
<Ryunosuke> Dont cross the streams!
<drphantom> mmm cinnamon roll.
<Azuredragon> Dont cross the livestreams, or you get the buffer
<Soulero> so bad it will blow up a giant molecule guy
<SirGanjalf> First rule of the Ghost Busting: DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS
<Brownclown> Kinda bad
<Alchemist> SCIENCE
<Soulero> *marshmellow guy
<DerpyMuffins> Dont cross the streams
<DerpyMuffins> So many memes made bc of that
<SteveCharb> thanks egon
<Saigneur> and now, ducks
<SirGanjalf> Second rule of ghost busting: DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS
<Cades> hey
<Dark92Enigma-> Soulero: i would tell you the most sexiest line, but that would be spoiling
<Bogy> oh no the cake!
<Sundaysmile> Slimer!
<Combustiblelemons> Crossing the memes on the other hand...
<Fl00t4hSh41> No crossing the streams? Not even in a public toilet?
<bashful> lol nice shooting
<Saigneur> aim : 0%
<pony_300> After being attacked, slimer goes back to eating. Slimer has the memory of a goldfish apparently.
<Soulero> Dark92Enigma-: ive seen the film brole
<SirGanjalf> Fl00t4hSh41: That's especially forbidden
<Barbetos> Yeah
<Dark92Enigma-> Third rule of ghost busting: DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS
<Sundaysmile> Set your guns to miss!
<Azuredragon> The flowers are still standing!
<bashful> fail
<Combustiblelemons> Magic.
<Fl00t4hSh41> SirGanjalf: But else are you going to use a two man urinal?
<ShiningDawn> fail
<Meanwhile> Close enough.
<Soulero> pony_300, no, a goldfish has the memory of a slime
<Azuredragon> 2nd rule, don't look into the trap
<pony_300> Well played.
<otakon> dat growl
<otakon> I LOOKED AT THE TRAP RAY
<otakon> and then their souls were sucked out
<Meanwhile> I wonder what it looks like.
<J_E_Smith71> Egon went blind for looking into the trap
<weccojecco> pokeball
<Azuredragon> WE CAME, WE SAW, WE KICKED ITS ASS!!!
<bashful> yeah!
<SirGanjalf> Guy looks kinda like John Cleese
<Combustiblelemons> best line ever
<Kotano> You caught Slimer!Do you wanna give slimer a nickname?
<SirGanjalf> Maybe because of "Fawlty Towers"
<Dark92Enigma-> VINI, VIDI, KICKASSIA
<J_E_Smith71> Yes! Slimer was caught! Would you like to give Slimer a nickname?
<Fl00t4hSh41> SirGanjalf: It's the british
<Saigneur> J_E_Smith71:D
<Fl00t4hSh41> SirGanjalf: They all look alike
<Azuredragon> 5000 money!
<Ryunosuke> and song!
<Soulero> because theyve done this so many times, they have a scale to how nasty the ghosts are
<Dark92Enigma-> J_E_Smith71: Pokemon FTW
<Dark92Enigma-> THIS THEME!
<Soulero> the song is starting...
<Meanwhile> Good morning I'm Roger Grimsby and I'm a generic newscaster.
<SirGanjalf> It costs 5000 dollars to keep this ghost... for 12 seconds!
<Soulero> THE SONG IS STARTING!
*Dark92Enigma- dances to the theme
<SteveCharb> what if this movie didn't show any of the ghosts for the whole movie?
<Alchemist> montage time!
<Dark92Enigma-> GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
<Brownclown> Free soy piglet!
<Combustiblelemons> Then i'd ask for my £3.50 back stevecharb.
<pony_300> SteveShart: better have a hell of a twist.
<Brownclown> woo
<Dark92Enigma-> GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
<SirGanjalf> MYTHBUSTERS!
<Ryunosuke> larry king
<SirGanjalf> BOAST BUSTERS!
<J_E_Smith71> LUIGI!
<Saigneur> love this song
<ASoftFluffyThing> GHOSTBUSTESR
<SirGanjalf> GHOST NAPPA!
<bashful> GHOSTBUSTERS!
<BladedWings|Away> look how young larry king is!?
<Soulero> SirGanjalf: that would be amazing if you just rented the service and after a week they put it back in there, like, blockbusters, but, GHOSTBUSTERS!
<Nyst> I love this movie. Science victorious!
<Lil_B> Ghost Fever... that could have been Title for something
<otakon> indeed
<J_E_Smith71> HE-MAN!
<Dark92Enigma-> GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
<Ryunosuke> that Kasey Kasem!
<otakon> Dark92Enigma-: wrong movie
<Blako> hi
<Meanwhile> Who you gonna call?
<J_E_Smith71> Them drawings on the Atlantic
<SteveCharb> Lil_B: would have been a good name for the sequel?
<Dark92Enigma-> otakon: we're on the right movie......
<Soulero> oh come on that was a brilliant play on words
<bashful> lol
<Lil_B> SteveCharb maybe, or an additional song
<SirGanjalf> GHOSTBUSTERS
<Ryunosuke> she is octavia?
<Soulero> ghostbusters? blockbusters?
<otakon> Dark92Enigma-: no we aren't, HE-MAN isn't until 2
<Soulero> get it?
<otakon> oh THIS dream
<SirGanjalf> dat scene:D
<Dark92Enigma-> otakon: you expect me to say.........GHOST NAPPA
<CriticKitten> And then this
<J_E_Smith71> I think in one of those shots they didn't have the permit to film so there was a police guy chasing them
<otakon> I didn't get it the FIRST time I saw this
<Saigneur> Dark92Enigma-: don't cross the streams !
<Ryunosuke> Oh mai!
<Azuredragon> Oh My~
<SteveCharb> Lil_B: oh, your idea's better
<otakon> J_E_Smith71: eeyup
<LordDerpington> Ghost blowjob! Woo! Woo! Woo!
<SirGanjalf> GHOST BLOWJOB!
<bashful> oh my..
<Meanwhile> Welp.
<otakon> EEYUP
<Bogy> :D
<Combustiblelemons> well I'll let this happen.
<pony_300> vegeta?vegeta?vegeta?vegeta?vegeta? ... I'm haunting you
<Starchaser> me gusta
<Fl00t4hSh41> Best haunting ever
<SteveCharb> roflolol
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/Lg64A.jpg
<otakon> I didn't get that scen when I was a kid
<SirGanjalf> Fl00t4hSh41: :D
<Combustiblelemons> Let's not call ghostbusters.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Good. :D
<bashful> lol
<Ryunosuke> that interview
<Dark92Enigma-> otakon and now...........?
<J_E_Smith71> otakon: Yeah I though his pants were coming off for the hell of it
<Azuredragon> the token black guy
<Wirisme> HIRED!
<RainbowAsh> Winston is best token black guy
<otakon> J_E_Smith71: yeah
<pony_300> ohhh, getting banged by a ghost?
<otakon> pony_300: no just a BJ
<J_E_Smith71> I keep forgetting Sumi doesn't do the Euro stream most of the time. I was about to put in Mica for an Oh Mai for that scene
<otakon> :)
<otakon> brb again need a drink
<pony_300> rofl: wonder if the person called that one in
<Combustiblelemons> would you?
<Soulero> wait a second... princess candence and princess celestia are sisters! but... princess candese was like, 16 pony years old when she was babysitting twilight
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Wait, putting in Mica gets the Oh my?
<SteveCharb> haha ditch that dweeb, billl murray is awesome
<Brownclown> Speaking of drinks, shandy time for me
<pony_300> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH probably not
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: I believe so
<Soulero> so princess celestias parents are obviously still alive
<AJIsAwesome> Soulero: Cadence is Celestia's niece.
<Alchemist> is she?
<Soulero> then how is she a princess?
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: all i've said was: GHOSTBUSTERS
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes she is
<Meanwhile> Who knows.
<Ryunosuke> i think?
<AJIsAwesome> That's what I heard.
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica=Yay, Sumi=WHOA, Mica=Oh Mai
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, yes, there are a few written sources
<J_E_Smith71> I think that's right
<Soulero> srly how is she a princess?
<Ryunosuke> Gozer!
<sonicdude558> ZOUL
<Alchemist> RainbowAsh: but is it mentioned in the series?
<Fl00t4hSh41> AJIsAwesome: Still implies that Celestia has relatives we don't know about
<pony_300> don't mess with the BULL GOZER!!
<Ryunosuke> zuul!
<Kotano> Soulero : Maybe it's like an Adventure Time thing,where they have a bunch of princesses
<CrimsonPhoenix> Soulero, how about you don't question it and wait and see
<Soulero> mlp makes no sense! its like they are making it up as they go along! is mlp the new lost?
<AJIsAwesome> Fl00t4hSh41: Precisely.
<Iwa> If Zuul is dutch, I can understand the Gozer part...Oh hoh hoh...
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, no. Blueblood is Celestia's nephew, though
<Combustiblelemons> Smooth.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Maybe Cadance is Bluebloods sister?
<Soulero> is there some overlying story arc that is developing right under our noses?
<Reactor> Hey, everyone!
<AJIsAwesome> Soulero: Here's an idea: Let's let the show explain itself.
<Ryunosuke> Zuul and Gozer are... sumerian?
<Combustiblelemons> friendzoned.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Reactor. :)
<Meanwhile> Yeah, really. Wait for the show to explain all that. And if they never do then...*shrug*
<SteveCharb> Soulero: oh gosh I thought you were serious
<RainbowAsh> Fl00t4hSh41, that would explain why Cadence was eager to get away from home to babysit
<Soulero> i love trap
<Ryunosuke> and Mr Peck
<Soulero> i mean traps
<Fl00t4hSh41> RainbowAsh: We don't know if he was as bad as a colt as he was adult
<bashful> lol
<Azuredragon> LYRA!
<pony_300> ahhhh ghost! *zaps Lyra*
<SteveCharb> watch out lyra, they'll think you're a ghost!!!
<Bogy> lyra what are you doing?
<Fl00t4hSh41> RainbowAsh: She could have babysat him as he grew up
<Bogy> :o
<Combustiblelemons> Dat customer service
<bashful> he has no dick
<J_E_Smith71> I see Lyra swimming out of nowhere
<Soulero> doctor who
<Dark92Enigma> Soulero: AJIsAwesome is right, let's wait and see
<Soulero> ?
<Soulero> oh come on of course they wont explain it
<AJIsAwesome> Soulero: How do you know?
<LordDerpington> Uh-uh-uh, you didn't say the magic word!
<bashful> please
<RainbowAsh> Fl00t4hSh41, I can't really imagine Blueblood as unspoiled, though.
<BaconMane> 0,5Hey ther ROvah
<BaconMane> 0,5Come on ovah
<AJIsAwesome> DAT BaconMane :)
<Dark92Enigma> PLEASE?
<Dark92Enigma> with CHERRY ON TOP
<BladedWings|Away> hi BaconMane
<J_E_Smith71> Wonder if Egon or Ray would have done this differently. Like would they have shown Peck the stuff or acted the way Peter did
<Fl00t4hSh41> RainbowAsh: Maybe its BECAUSE of her babysitting he behaves so spoiled
<Soulero> when have they ever gotten that deep in an mlp episode AJIsAwesome ?
<LordDerpington> Ray and Egon would've shown it all off proudly.
<SteveCharb> what if Luna was cadance and blueblood's mom?
<Sundaysmile> Twinkie¬
<J_E_Smith71> Like if they would have pissed Peck off to get the C&D warrent
<J_E_Smith71> Here comes the Twinkie
<bashful> thats a big twinkie
<Nyst> You know, for as much a peck Peck is; he's not really wrong here. Nuclear accelerators? That's gotta be a radiation hazard.
<Soulero> thats a big twinkie
<BladedWings|Away> i want that twinkie!
<AJIsAwesome> Soulero: How about the Zap Apple Jam episode?
<Chrysalis> dats a BIG twinkie
<Dark92Enigma> THAT'S A BIG TWINKIE
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/pix/832.jpg
<Bogy> why its reminds me of "TWILY!!"
<SteveCharb> big twinkie
<Bogy> :D
<Fl00t4hSh41> RainbowAsh: Maybe the way he behaves is simply an act to scare away all the golddiggers who must come after him
<Dark92Enigma> PLAY ME OFF PAUL
<LordDerpington> Ooh, I had my first Twinkie the other day. They're nice.
<pony_300> back when twinkies were TWINKIES
<Fl00t4hSh41> RainbowAsh: Like rarity
<Chrysalis> thats the average american consumption of twinkies
<Chrysalis> per day
<Soulero> AJIsAwesome: that derails my argument so it doesnt count
<Meanwhile> I don't think we get twinkies here.
<Chrysalis> we dont
<Chrysalis> but i tell you what
<Kotano> we don't either
<Kencolt> I don't like twinies.
<Chrysalis> twinkies are god damn wonderful
<SteveCharb> woof
<Combustiblelemons> I've never had a twikie either
<Bogy> i don't even know what a twinkie is...
<Bogy> :D
<BladedWings|Away> LordDerpington: ever had a fried twinkie...that is almost death XD
<Combustiblelemons> what do they taste like?
<Alchemist> I dont even know what twinkies are, but I have heard the name before.
<Chrysalis> friend of mine bought a box back from america
<Chrysalis> they are soo tasty
<pinkiespice> its papaer machee. :D
<Dark92Enigma> Soulero: i guess it's up to the audience to figure that out
<RainbowAsh> Fl00t4hSh41, it's all possible, we just don't have enough informations to conclude any of that, though.
<J_E_Smith71> Bogy: Yellow sponge cake with creme filling
<Soulero> obv
<Chrysalis> shame that american chocolate sucks balls
<otakon> yeah
<SteveCharb> oh my god I haven't had a twinkie in like 12 years
<otakon> Chrysalis: don't rub it in
<Meanwhile> Cream sponge cake.
<Dark92Enigma> I WENT THROUGHT THE
<Combustiblelemons> so like a chocolate ecaire?
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: true
<Meanwhile> Sounds alright.
<Dark92Enigma> DANGER ZONE
<J_E_Smith71> Chrysalis: What about Hershey bars?
<Ryunosuke> and locked out
<sonicdude558> Locked out
<Chrysalis> suck
<Ryunosuke> again
<Chrysalis> seriously
<pony_300> just realizes; LOVE TRIANGLE
<Fl00t4hSh41> RainbowAsh: Neither do we have any evidence to the contrary
<Bogy> oh..kay and is it good? :D
<otakon> Combustiblelemons: it's lighter and fluffier not nearly as heavy
<pony_300> realized
<Chrysalis> you americans can't do chocolate
<Kencolt> Bogy: A Twinkie is basically a sponge cake filled wth vanilla cream. It used to be banana cream until WW2, when most bananas were diverted to the US Military.
<Dark92Enigma> GONNA TAKE YOU RIGHT INTO THE DANGER ZOOOOOOOOOOOONE
<sonicdude558> Damn it ninja'd by Ryunosuke
<Chrysalis> hell even the god damn french do it better than you
<otakon> and BRICK JOKE
<Lil_B> Is the Stream down? I'm pressing refresh, bute it won't even load the Stream Window :/
<bashful> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> Poor Rick
<sonicdude558> aaaand ghost
<Combustiblelemons> I'll get one when i head into the states next year :P
<Meanwhile> Lil_B: No it's up.
<otakon> Lil_B: refresh, clear cache all that happy jazz
<SteveCharb> somebody shrunk the kiiiiiids
<Chrysalis> i can't believe i just said the french do something better than someone else
<RainbowAsh> Fl00t4hSh41, that is true.
<Ryunosuke> Lil_B, try f5
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: wine?
<Fl00t4hSh41> So the keymaster constantly locks himself out of his appartment?
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: cheese?
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: Giving up?
<Shizuka> 13Chrysalis: they're really great at surrendering
<RedDragonX> toast
<Chrysalis> dat herdmind
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: Ask the streamer for a direct link via PM and they'll give you one
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....
<CrimsonPhoenix> Now I
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: art?
<MadSurge> Back from eating pizza! :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm offended
<Chrysalis> suprisingly the french have more victories than defeat
<AJIsAwesome> Soulero: What about Hearth's Warming Eve?
<Chrysalis> art is useless
<Combustiblelemons> Give up on what?
<CrimsonPhoenix> thank you Chrysalis
<J_E_Smith71> Chrysalis: What about Ghirardelli Chocolate Company? (Although it says there a US division of a Swiss company)
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: conquering people?
<Dark92Enigma> TAKE OFF YOUR BLOUSE, AND YOUR OOOOOONDAPANTS
<Combustiblelemons> you can get paid for art.
<Stormy> bread!
<reddawn> oh no its a lyra ghost
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: cooking? Wait no, that's us :D
<otakon> TRIVIA! The actor's doing this scene were originally afraid of hurting Ms. Weaver or grabbing her in inappropriate places. She told thme not to worry so much about it.
<BladedWings|Away> ZUUUUUUUUUL
<Kotano> Chrysalis And still everybody only remembers the defeats
<Chrysalis> we taught the french how to cook dmanit
<pony_300> Chrysalis: but the Al Bundy joke is so much fun

<otakon> WHAT DOG SOUNDS LIKE THAT?
<cowvarkian> MadSurge: I don't like tomato sauce ._.
<Meanwhile> cowvarkian: I know you know that I know, I'm just being facetious.

<Dark92Enigma> HE SURVIVED?
<Meanwhile> You will perish in flames.
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: no u
<J_E_Smith71> You might wanna get some Clear Eyes Louis
<Barbetos> That poor lady =(
<Dark92Enigma> What an ICE-Hole
<Barbetos> Everytime that makes me sad
<Barbetos> She was just trying to get some cans
<RainbowAsh> That would have made an interesting twist if the horse was the gatekeeper
<Barbetos> And that ass hole destroyed her bag!
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma: He got possesed
<pony_300> I hope they go into why the two possessed victims have such distinct personalities
<Combustiblelemons> There's a lot of things we're into
<cowvarkian> RainbowAsh: theres probably a fanfic for that
<pony_6567> i'm the gatekeeper

<Alchemist> no shit sherlock!
<cowvarkian> depths of slor is best depths
<pony_300> gatekeeper possesses the bumbling goof, becomes a bumbling goof similar it's possession. On the otherhand the keymaster turns into a horny nympho
<Bogy> i think he's totally normal...
<otakon> pinkiespice: dude that's kick ass looking man
<SteveCharb> I kind of see the two possessed victims' apparent difference to be symptomatic of their environment... aka hsots

<LordDerpington> I love all those old-school special effects.
<pony_6567> look at what you'v done goverment
<Fl00t4hSh41> Considering that the containment grid is nuclear powered and just blew up, didn't the whole town just get irradiated and covered in radioactive dust?
<Vordox> HEEERE'S THE SOGN
<CriticKitten> Well now you fucked up.
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/7/28/CIngYHnsoEGSm7EFzGS9Gw2.jpg

<pony_6567> hahaha:D
<Dark92Enigma> SLIMER!
<Combustiblelemons> pinkie pie is best ghost buster.
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho wants to watch g 3.6
<LordDerpington> I think they called it a laser containment system.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kencolt: They said the powergrid wasn't good enough for their needs when they moved in
<pony_300> yea it's their packs which are nuclear "accelerated"
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kencolt: So they must run it off one of their own reactors, like their proton packs
<pony_6567> life is like a video game ghost have hacks
<Kencolt> Fl00t4hSh41: And they upgraded... this movie is NOT meant to make sense.
<pony_6567> both
<Alchemist> SCIENCE

<Dark92Enigma> IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT
<RainbowAsh> FlaschenJoe11, indeed. ^^;
<Fl00t4hSh41> Sundaysmile: With the prison economy being what it is you can get anything inside a jail
<Sundaysmile> so they did it for Bill Murray? I'm cool with that
<Kencolt> BIG difference.
<pony_300> it's the uhhhh Family Matters guy?

<J_E_Smith71> On the censored TV versions, dickless was Wally Wick
<Meanwhile> Dickless.

<Meanwhile> Whiter than he is.
<sonicdude558> Its like Kindergarden all over again!
<Dark92Enigma> So, this is the CENSORED version
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma: No it's not
<LordDerpington> J_E_Smith71: I've never seen that version. The one they showed on Channel 5 (UK) a few months ago was a real hack-job.
<pony_6567> nope
<Sundaysmile> he has seen shit which will turn him even asian!
<Azuredragon> DOGS AND CATS LIBING TOGETHER
<J_E_Smith71> LordDerpington: That's how the redub was on American TV
<Dark92Enigma> J_E_Smith71: oH, it's even better
<Azuredragon> living*
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dogs and cats togetheR? Thats just insane!
<RainbowAsh> Peck was like "Not dog and cats!"

<Kencolt> pony_300: The Evnironmental Protection Agency. A US govt agency devoted to study, research, and licensing of any business's impact on the environment. Often criticised for taking the issue too far, and denying a store to be built because of possible negative impact on an already extinct mealworm... at least it seems that way at times.

<Fl00t4hSh41> New York city really should implement some kind of limits on cars in down town to deal with that smog problem....
<otakon> SteveCharb: bc the kid doesn't become a Musketeer OFFICIALLY until the end of the book/movie

<Meanwhile> It's Miller time.
<RainbowAsh> CrimsonPhoenix, more like 15 years by now
<pony_6567> thats imposibel
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah
<Dark92Enigma> pony83073: sadly, the dubbed one
<CrimsonPhoenix> well at least I said over
<Chrysalis> hey Saturn, you know how the twitter linked cluttershys gf's etsy
<Azuredragon> CARD GAMER ON MOTORCYCLES?!
<Kencolt> Saturn: The real problem there, is... Dramtically speaking-- Card Games On Motorcycles actually WORKED to an extent.
<Chrysalis> really should warn just how feminine the stuff on there actually is
<Soulero> thats one big twinkie
<flutterchu> Combustiblelemons: http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/17600000/PIKACHU-LOVE-S-LOVE-S-KETCHUP-pikachu-17667283-229-220.jpg
<pony_300> damn. already seen the dubbed version
<Sundaysmile> and then the crowd died
<Dark92Enigma> THAT'S A LOT OF FIIIIIIIIIIISH
<reddawn> its nearly mr creampuff time!!!!!
<LordDerpington> CHOOSE
<flutterchu> btb
<Azuredragon> DISCORD
<Combustiblelemons> FLUTTERSHY
<pony_6567> i chose mashmellow
<Combustiblelemons> cutest destroyer ever.
<pony_6567> a dalek
<reddawn> he chose rarity
<SteveCharb> RAY
<Kencolt> But... Ray has already got an empty head, so if he tries to empty it...
<otakon> and then Fluttershy would destroy us all
<SteveCharb> WHAT DID YOU DO RAY
<pony_6567> were screwed
<Sundaysmile> Inb4 Rarity
<Fl00t4hSh41> MEGARARITY!
<Sundaysmile> dammit
<pony_300> I never reeally understood this ending. Gozer or whatever makes this choice thing, and then goes away? Doesn't feel like it was beaten, more like Gozer didn't feel like messing with them anymore
<Chrysalis> Mega-rarity gooooo
<Meanwhile> It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow man.
<CrimsonPhoenix> IT'S MARSHMALLOW TIME
<Bogy> :o
<Dark92Enigma> LOOK! It's MEGA RARITY!
<Azuredragon> MR. STAYPUFF
<Sundaysmile> SHE'S FABULOUS
<Combustiblelemons> best line delivery ever.
<RainbowAsh> pony_300, I guess he did what he came to do
<J_E_Smith71> pony_300: It's Gozer's Destructor Form
<pony_6567> mashmellowy goodness
<Barbetos> http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/5/4/p1LGdY1v4EuL66RTvUL1sQ2.jpg
<Fl00t4hSh41> Where's godzilla when you need him?
<Kencolt> Combustiblelemons: Not as much as this one.
<Dark92Enigma> Fl00t4hSh41: we need FISH, stat!
<RainbowAsh> I had the marshmallow man action figure when I was young
<Dark92Enigma> OF COURSE
<reddawn> FEAR MY MARSHMALLOWY GOODNESS
<pony_300> ohhh. So beating Staypuff means they beat Gozer?
<Meanwhile> pony_300: Gozer is the marshmallow.
<Kencolt> Egon's line here is PERFECT.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dark92Enigma: I don't think MEGARARITY will go for fish
<pony_6567> yum
<Chrysalis> its a 200ft tall rarity?
<J_E_Smith71> pony_300: Yep. The explain it further in the video game
<Chrysalis> why you need thought
<Dark92Enigma> Fl00t4hSh41: nO, to call on GODZILLA
<Azuredragon> NOBODY STEPS ON THE CHURCH
<RainbowAsh> Chrysalis, now I want a crossover pic
<bashful> mother puss bucket
<Chrysalis> go butt stallion!
<Dark92Enigma> NOT ON MY CHURCH
<Bogy> kill it with fire!
<pony_7901> Random pony.
<pony_300> though seriously, this wasn't a bad move, either way you look at it, becoming a marshmallow is the stupidest thing possible
<Combustiblelemons> go caramel! kick his marshmallow ass!
<SteveCharb> I always see people stepping on churches in my town, it's a shame people aren't more responsible
<pony_6567> lol
<pony_300> couple of bunkerbusters, that thing would be trashed
<Fl00t4hSh41> Damnit caramel, we're in the middle of a climax here, get out of the frame!
<Sundaysmile> god damn bill
<SteveCharb> like give a hoot, don't step on churches
<pony_6567> yeah thats good
<J_E_Smith71> pony_300: That's because Gozer let them choose the form and Ray randomly thought of Stay Puft marshmellows
<bashful> good enough
<Dark92Enigma> CROSS THE STREAMS! EVEN WHEN SOME OF US MIGHT BE CRUSHED
<CrimsonPhoenix> WE MUST CROSS THE STREAMS
<Combustiblelemons> at least marshmallows are flammable.
<CrimsonPhoenix> inb4buffer
<J_E_Smith71> Bronystate crosses over with Haxmega
<J_E_Smith71> It destroys the internet
<Combustiblelemons> haxmega?
<pony_6567> crossing streams are fun
<pony_6567> :$
<Meanwhile> Boom.
<LordDerpington> I'm melting!
<Bogy> a firework!
<J_E_Smith71> Combustiblelemons: Another pony streamer
<Bogy> :o
<Kotano> And then everyone was burned by flaming hot marshmallow goo
<reddawn> ITS RAINING RARITY!!!!!
<Combustiblelemons> oh.
<pony_300> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, right, they did beat Gozer directly
<Combustiblelemons> thought this was the only one
<bashful> melted marshmallow
<Meanwhile> Look out for giant chunks of marshmallow.
<pony_300> my memory of this ending is totally wrong
<Dark92Enigma> HEART HEART HEART
<pony_6567> i ate good that day
<Sundaysmile> Rarity goo everywhere!
<Azuredragon> everyone came
<Dark92Enigma> HEART HEART HEART
<J_E_Smith71> Combustiblelemons: There's several, but this is the big one
<Ryunosuke> all that bukake
<Dark92Enigma> EAT MY HEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAART!
<flutterchu> rarity :'(
<Combustiblelemons> indeed.
<Meanwhile> Eeeeeewwww.
<Chrysalis> Ryunosuke no
<Kencolt> For once and all-- Rarity is NOT a marshmallow. She's much more like a fine Creme Brulee' without the Brulee part.
<Dark92Enigma> Rarity, WHAT HAVE WE DONE......
<pony_300> tasty tasty bukkake
<Bogy> rarity everywhere
<Bogy> :o
<Crippler> Yeah, If I were in the same position I would have thought of Fluttershy or something.
<Saturn> 08,01Ryunosuke: ...
<DerpyMuffins> I wanted to make a Rarity 'came' joke, but someone already did
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kencolt, I'm with you
<J_E_Smith71> Combustiblelemons: Hax only streams during new eps I think, unlike here where's there's almost always something going on
<pony_6567> lyra
<bashful> he is all clean lol
<RainbowAsh> You alright?
<somepony_else> that's one big smore
<Ryunosuke> RAY, TOO SOON
<Azuredragon> swiming in marshmellow
<Dark92Enigma> Kencolt: oh, thanks for the enlightment :)
<Kencolt> Actually, considering her taste in hats, tat might be thye Brulee'...
<Kotano> A giant Pinkie Pie would be my choice for the world to end.
<pony_6567> push him off
<Chrysalis> Saturn when can i throw money at you for buck 2013
<Combustiblelemons> She lives!
<somepony_else> no, chocolate rain!
<pony_300> I'd prefer trollestia if I really had to chose the end of the world
<Bogy> or ways out of soap :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'd prefer Pinkie
<Dark92Enigma> she's alive........she's ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE!!!!!!!!!!
<pony_6567> i was thinking of daleks when she said to chose
<Sundaysmile> And then he went on to shrink children
<CrimsonPhoenix> ASoftFluffyThing, that's a giant Pinkie
<Vordox> Siggie: "Where am I?" "You're history"
<RainbowAsh> Sundaysmile, EXTERMINATE
<reddawn> this makes me want to watch zombieland
<weeping_pegasi82> darn it I missed a lot of ghostbusters again
<pony_6567> ...
<bashful> give me your brain tissue
<Vordox> ok
<Sundaysmile> it's the ending pegasi
<Fl00t4hSh41> So the moral of the movie is that nuclear exlosions solve smog problems?
<pony_300> the end would be so hilarious. Gotcha! *trolololololololololol* No I won't send you to the moon.... I'll bring the moon to you! *trololololololololol*
<reddawn> EHO YOU GONNA CALL
<J_E_Smith71> Conglaturation!!! You have completed a great game. And prooved the justice of our culture. Now go and rest our heroes!
<Bogy> last time i watched it was... a cup of years... dunno but a long time
<Bogy> ^^

<BladedWings|Away> hi Nittany_Discord
<pony_6567> * puts hand up
*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in a marshmallow maid corset

<ASoftFluffyThing> GHOSTBUSTERS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I feel fluffy and sticky now.
<Kencolt> Nyst: I wasn't a kid when I saw this first...
<J_E_Smith71> Let's go Ghostbusters, let's go, let's go, let's go
<flutterchu> i dont know there phone number :'(
<J_E_Smith71> Oh wrong cartoon
<CrimsonPhoenix> this reminds me
*ASoftFluffyThing cleans Nittany_Discord
<Nyst> J_E_Smith71: I never got the toy, but I figured I'd just make a pack when I grew up into an adult :)
<pony_6567> it's 711
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: You feeling okay? :)
<DjOctavia> watch out for incoming ghozer!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> my brother had a lot of Ghostbusters stuff when he was a kid
<pony_6567> wut
<Dark_Horst> Fl00t4hSh41: true. but that one didnt attract as many ufo nuts^^
<Bogy> *applause*
<pony_7901> Ghostbusters
<Combustiblelemons> *applauds*
<Bogy> :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> I now have a new quest to find and buy a Ghostbusters shirt
<flutterchu> yo caramel
<Vordox> Oh Hai Caramel
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm fine.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dark_Horst: Pitty that
<bashful> One of my favorite movies ever
<pony_7901> "applauds"
<Combustiblelemons> dat heardmind Bogy
<Dark92Enigma> Now my take on it: Like "Holy Grail" its charm is in referencing a mature world of slightly twisted forces, keeping some constant. Its a familiar place, naturally found. Its that natural access that makes it so endearing. Nothing is forced; no one is trying very hard. They go there easily and we do as well. Action and comedy relief combine perfectly, making it a masterpiece 8,2/10
<ASoftFluffyThing> ZUUUUL/10
<Sundaysmile> Hey Caramel! Down in Front!
<reddawn> the ghostbusters cartoon was awesome too

<Meanwhile> Sumica gets extras and mine still refuses to show up. Helpful.
<DashWithRainbows> Sumica Yep. Even fluttercry got one.
<Chrysalis> we need moar bronies on that
<Ryunosuke> iirc, the Tsukunsa Blast was a near impact asteroid blast with the equivalant of 1k H-bombs
<Dark_Horst> what sounds most likely for tunguska is an ice and gas-filled meteorite that vombusted jus before impact
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dark_Horst: Morokenweg. They new how to make big bombs back then....
<killerpony7733> Sumica I signed up for the beta a while back but meh didn't get any
<Wirisme> lol
<SteveCharb> Wirisme: no that's like more than infinity
<Barbetos> killerpony7733 they just gave out a bunch of codes to current beta testers

<Dark92Enigma> red_ony: she can. Math is her weakness
<Sundaysmile> y'know of all things... I've yet to see a fan made vid where Discord Squee's
