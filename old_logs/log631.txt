<pony_4042> That Inkie Dance.
<NullRadix> Cypresswolf: and then Pinkie was banished to ponyville

<Sumica> 00,10wreky art time yay
<Sylandest> howdy MLP_Brovakiin, and howdy to Wrek as well!
<Jmo> Yay Wrek :3
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Wrek> 05so yeah
<Wrek> 05...
<DocSane> I should really sit down and learn how to art.
<Wrek> 05lets see
<DocSane> (Obscure joke to anyone who ever read Newtype magazine)
<Rommulus> this is my 1st ever time on Bronystate and it is awesome art and streaming, magical
<Wrek> 05enjoy the music
<Buytoast> draw godzilla tap dancing on the hindenburg
<cow334> DocSane: I'm trying to learn little by little im getting there
<DocSane> Rommulus: It becomes adictive.
<MASF123> That pic reminds me of KND the one with The CMC and Spike together.
<Eli> DocSane: i'm trying. it's really fun :) you should go for it
<MLP_Brovakiin> Buytoast: :D
<Rommulus> Who is doing the art at the moment?
<Sumica> 00,10it's a jackel!
<MASF123> Lol.
<MASF123> Damily Guy
<Sumica> 00,10Rommulus, Wrek is
<MASF123> Family
<Rommulus> awesome!
<DocSane> MASF123: That rocket's too well-built to be KnD tech
<DerpyMuffins> Oh yay Wrek is streaming
<DocSane> Uh-oh, sensing incoming bipedal pony. I HATE bipedal ponies.
<MASF123> DocSane 2X4 technology has it's faults too
<DerpyMuffins> You hate Lyra?
<DocSane> Derpy_Hooves: She's not actually bipedal. She walks on all fours.
<MASF123> :O GASP!
<Vivix> bipedal = slang for too human
<DerpyMuffins> Its Muffins not Hooves
<DocSane> Derpy_Hooves: I just think ponies look weird and unnatural when they're drawn bipedal.
<pony_4042> I should play more TF2. I had no idea that Moonstuck Woona was in VS Saxton Hale mode.
<Vivix> lile LittemissJay? Great faces, but dat bipedal all over
<DocSane> Derpy_Hooves: The characters work better when you keep them four-legged.
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like a ponyfort2 server pony_4042
<cratorkid> hey guys , hadnt been here in a while
<DocSane> Bipedalism leads inevitably to weird anthropomorphic horse people.
<Eli> for bipedal pony: http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/244/d/4/when_no_one_is_watching_by_tamalesyatole-d5d5awh.gif
<Vivix> DocSane, you're pinging hte wrong derpy, but yeah I agree
<DocSane> Sorry.
<Derpy_Hooves> >.>
<pony_4042> Lyra is the only good anthro pony. Anyother just looks odd.
<Vivix> I think bipedalism often looks anthro even if it still has all the feral traits
<DocSane> See, a horse's legs aren't built for bipedalism. The main leg is up where a human's thigh would be.
<Vivix> you know what bugs me the most in fanart? If they bend the hindlegs teh wrong way
<Vivix> it looks so incredibly painful and wrong
<cratorkid> human walking is just a series of controlled falls
<DocSane> They turn into these creepy, ungainly aliens with reverse jointed knees.
<Eli> DocSane: i'm not sure tehy can even bend it to stand on 2 legs for an extended period of time
<Vivix> yeah
<NullRadix> Vivix: the problem with all these ponies? Someone broke their legs
<Vivix> they can rear up and look cool, but it looks odd when they walk
<MASF123> Dat Lyra needs guns
<Vivix> NullRadix, true ;__; some cruel fanart artist with a sledgehammer
<Wrek> 05enjoy!
<CrimsonPhoenix> anatomical studies in art
<CrimsonPhoenix> only on Bronystate
<Wrek> 05you are now enjoyign MAd caddies live!
<NullRadix> (slightly modified quote from the tutorial I followed when I was making terrible attempts to draw)
<DocSane> Eli: Yeah, horses can rear up momentarily, which works on the show when you see a character kick up to two legs for a moment, and then fall back down a moment later.
<Rommulus> Hey Wrek, what do you use for your work? tablet, program what not
<pony_4042> Eh, a mlp pony walking on their back legs reminds me of the legs of a Quarian from Mass Effect for some reason.
<Sylandest> Wrek: oh, this group! I remember them! Lovely choice! ty!
<Wrek> 05tablet
<Vivix> I am very fond of horselegs, like the way they look
<alexxm> bye guys
<Sylandest> laters alexxm
<cratorkid> bye alexxm
<DocSane> A lot of people don't seem to understand how a horse's anatomy works.
<Rommulus> bye alexxm
<Vivix> but I haven't studied the inner workings enough to say how it should look when they do rear up and try to walk
<cow334> later alexxm
<Sergio_Scriptor> bye alexxm :)
<Vivix> DocSane, yeah- even the show has some horsefails, like the foals in school all bend their legs the wrong way, but the adults don't usually
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai guys :)
<cratorkid> hey MaxTheBrony
<MadSurge> Hello again guys, I'm back from a trip to the morgue. Couldn't bear to see my friend's body, but I was able to donate for her flower crown... :'(
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi MaxTheBrony :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> sorry MadSurge :(
<DocSane> Vivix: You have to remember that what we see as the upper leg/knee/lower leg is actually the equivalent of a human foot/tow joint/middle toe.
<Sylandest> my condolences, MadSurge
<cratorkid> MadSurge: :(
<DocSane> MadSurge: That's...awful.
<MaxTheBrony> Hey MadSurge , :(
<Vivix> ah yeah-
<cow334> MadSurge: sorry about that bro
<DocSane> MadSurge: What happened? Accident?
<MaxTheBrony> :s
<MadSurge> DocSane: she hanged herself...
<DocSane> MadSurge: So sorry for you.
<Eli> MadSurge: i know the feeling... one of my childhood friends dorwned... it wasn't a lovely sight...:( and it was suicide too...
<ponyromPR> hey im back

<cow334> Wrek: what was that song called
<ponyromPR> hi Wrek
<killerpony7733> Sumica looks like M.Bison to me
<MaxTheBrony> ponyromPR: im kinda depressed and sad cause got reminded of death.
<Sumica> 00,10check his DA killerpony7733
<Eli> MASF123: depressed > drug addict > and then put into a mental by his parents... he hated it, so he jumped into a river
<ponyromPR> aw:( im sorry :( anything i can do? MaxTheBrony
<Eli> MASF123: one of the reasons i don't do drugs.
<MaxTheBrony> Nah, thanks anyways :)
<ponyromPR> ok, if anythin comes up lemme know
<MASF123> Eli I thought so it always starts with depression, but Drug addiction and mental instituation and he was a kid?!?! :O
<MadSurge> But I know that she wouldn't want me to dwell on her death. So, let's change topic and have a laugh for her, please

<MaxTheBrony> Wrek do you plan before hand you draw? or did you just start by drawing a pony body?
<cow334> morning kirzstryfe how are you today
<MadSurge> MaxTheBrony: I think he plans on the pony body
<spitfirecolt2> i feel like the world is coming down on me
<DocSane> Wrek: I didn't see the answer before. Do you use mouse or tablet when you draw?
<Rommulus> apparently a tablet
<MaxTheBrony> cause it seems like he have drawn this beforehand and is just showing off xD Its too good
<kirzstryfe> he uses a tablet for sai
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah i do too , but i suck.
<DocSane> kirzstryfe: Thanks
<MadSurge> spitfirecolt2: hang on there. We support you!
<Rommulus> I agree with mad
<spitfirecolt2> thanks guys
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<kirzstryfe> Wrek has a lot of practice, so he doesn't always need to do a full sketch if he has a good idea of it in his head
<CCCP> Wrek which pony is it?

<MaxTheBrony> Heya AJIsAwesome hes drawing Aj i think
*AJIsAwesome hugs Jay ponyromPR Sergio_Scriptor MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<ponyromPR> /)
<Dken2021> oh god, I'm still on? ugh, I think I need to turn off auto log
<ponyromPR> AJIsAwesome: /)
<mitamaking> Is that a Confederate pony?
<Dken2021> well, hello everyone I guess
<Sergio_Scriptor> /) AJIsAwesome :)
<mitamaking> oh and hi
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Dken2021 :)
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: Hello!
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Hello!
<mitamaking> Wait that is AJ..... oh dang it
<MaxTheBrony> Heya mitamaking
<mitamaking> you know Wrek when I pulled up your Cheerilee picture I had to explain the term clop to my brother, it was quite fun
<ponyromPR> why dont you just ask who it is?
<Jmo> Oh that would of been fun.
<Sergio_Scriptor> mitamaking: please...tell me more :)
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: How did that go?
<mitamaking> He thought it was a stupidly cleaver term for it
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Hi everypony. My mind just got blown.
<mitamaking> *clever?
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: Hello!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> heya AJIsAwesome
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Kawaii_icybeauti :) what happen ?
<mitamaking> not sure how to spell that
<Dken2021> Kawaii_icybeauti sounds like it was surprising
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Sergio_Scriptor: Heya
<mitamaking> And looked disgusted
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dken2021: Because I cannot post likies at this time, I'll tell you the title. Go on youbtube and look up "Scary Monsters and Nice Parasprites"
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: I would think of the picture as saucy rather than "clop", IMO.
<mitamaking> AJIsAwesome: I know but I mentioned how we were joking that clothes make a pony more sexy and it led to me saying clop
<Dken2021> oh that krillex pony thing?
<Dken2021> *skrillex
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Oh, ok.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dken2021: Yeah.
<mitamaking> But AJ as a confederate pony, interesting
<DocSane> mitamaking: Clothes make the ponies look more human, as does drawing them bipedal.
<Buytoast> oh boy, i saw skrillex in the chat
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Buytoast: Wait, what?
<mitamaking> That is AJ right?
<DocSane> mitamaking: After a while, you may as well just make them gijinka ponies instead of actual ponies
<Rommulus> all those layers
<Buytoast> some asshat is talking about shitty music
<Sumica> 00,10still not sure if AJ or derpy
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Buytoast: It was a YTPMV with a skirllex song used. It was quiet awesome frankly.
<mitamaking> Buytoast: stop the presses
<Songy> ello
<Rommulus> its still very difficult to determine
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone pumped for The Last Guardian?
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: :D
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Wait a sec, what are the movies?
<mitamaking> AJIsAwesome: If that game still exist...
<Buytoast> give me a cat and a recorder and i'll make skrillex's new hit single
<Kawaii_icybeauti> for next week?
<Buytoast> i'll call it
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: I hope it does.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sumica: i bet 50 bits it is derpy... :P
<Buytoast> Me slamming a door on my dick and throwing water on an angry cat
<Dken2021> Kawaii_icybeauti gonna be determined for lottery today
<Buytoast> it'll net millions
<Rommulus> I am agreeing on derpy
<mitamaking> Last Guardian or Versus 13, which comes out first
<mitamaking> and poor PS3
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Never heard of Versus 13. What's it about?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Oh sweet, I can go pick up the kelado today. I'm going within the area of a game stop.
<mitamaking> Final Fantasy Versus 13
<Pikachu> Hi bronies/ponies :)

<Kawaii_icybeauti> Hey Pikachu , how did I not think up that name? And hey MadSurge
<AJIsAwesome> Pikachu: Hello!
<mitamaking> It is a game in the 13 universe that is being made by the Kingdom Hearts team, we are not getting KH3 till Versus comes out and I hate it
<Pikachu> I hope this is applejack XD
<AJIsAwesome> Pikachu: Yep.
<mitamaking> Applejack makes more sense but it looks more like Derpy to me
<Sergio_Scriptor> i bet it's derpy :P
<Pikachu> AJIsAwesome: YES I GUESSED IT RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Rommulus> I hope its derpy
<Maid_RainBow> Wrek : you made a very nice Cheerilee
<MadSurge> Kingdom Hearts needs to have Nier characters!
<AJIsAwesome> It's probably the hair color.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Wait till he zooms out agin, we'll see

<Pikachu> Plus guess what i got on minecraft?? (it starts with m and ends with y)
<mitamaking1> "Disconnected from server." The heck
<Sergio_Scriptor> Pikachu: i have no idea :P
<Kandarihu_> I think the Fluttershy server died just now
<mitamaking1> Rarity died too
<Pikachu> ANSWER: Mine little pony (now im a pony :) )
<Sergio_Scriptor> Pikachu: cool :)
*mitamaking1 waiting for mitamaking to leave
<Rommulus> So many twilights :)
<Kammerjunk> Silly PonyChat.
<Pikachu> Twilight party
<mitamaking1> :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> EVERYPONY twilight spam :)
<Sumica> 00,10guess a server died again
<mitamaking1> :$
<Rommulus> everytime a twilight is posted a server dies
<Pikachu> ouch for sever :(
<Sumica> 00,10so what server was it this time I wonder
<mitamaking1> Sumica: is it happening often?
<Rommulus> :( poor server
<Sumica> 00,10recentaly yeah
<Kandarihu_> I think a disconnection by server death means that all the nicks have to be killed manually. The nicks that aren't registered have to be killed manually by a server admin.
<Sumica> 00,104 time in as many days
<Kandarihu_> Sumica, Fluttershy
<mitamaking1> Sumica: need to fix that soon, sorry
<Pikachu> Why is my sever On my computor shutting down too ???? :O
<Sumica> 00,10they will auto time out after 5 min Kandarihu
<Kandarihu_> Sumica, okay.
<Sumica> 00,10but as you can see, most know how to use ghost command
<Pikachu> Sumica: Thank u for telling us :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> thank god im registed in bronystate :P
<Sumica> 00,10would let the IRCops know but i am sure they already do
<Kandarihu_> Well, I know how to Ghost, but I've neglected to register my nick.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Kandarihu: it's better if you do :)
<mitamaking1> I thought I had registered my nice
<mitamaking1> *nick
<Dken2021> how do you ghost a non registered nick?
<Sumica> 00,10ah looks like Fluttershy is down again
<MASF123> no
<mitamaking1> you can make it Rarity
<MASF123> Don't refresh the chat! :O
<mitamaking1> Everypony into Spike?
<BaconMane> 0,5I use an IRC client like a baws
<BaconMane> 0,5therefore I ALWAYS use spike theater :3
<Sumica> 00,10yeah, unfortunatly Fluttershy is in the same dater center that holds the chat client embed
<Sumica> 00,10so if you refresh chat you wont be able to get back in
<Sumica> 00,10ponychat is probably also down
<BaconMane> 0,5But I can see you
<Kandarihu_> I IRC, and the only reason I use a theater page other than Spike is because I prefer my stream embed to be on the left side instead of the middle
<Jmo> DAYUM
<BaconMane> 0,5HOLY FUCK
<CrimsonPhoenix> NET SPLIT
<Dken2021> there goes the split

<MadSurge> Sumica: :D
<Pearly> O.o
<MadSurge> Sumica: there's a zombie on the lawn, we don't want zombies on the lawn
*Sergio_Scriptor is scared of the zombie chat apocalipse and needs a hug from the rest of the survivors
<Rommulus> Hugs
<mitamaking> MadSurge: I will use my flower power to stop it
<Rommulus> oh damn

*otakon sighs at
<Sumica> 00,10it's not just you otakon
<Sumica> 00,10i was on the same server as was dari and shizu
<Pearly> I had to look up a ghost command
<MASF123> "Appaloosa!"
<Unnr> otakon: because you are highly excitable and the network likes to see you get riled up?
<Pearly> now I remember on how
<Magical_Pablez94> Sumica another netsplit?
<Pearly> yeah
<Sumica> 00,10yeah fluttershy again
<Kandarihu> I swear, the next time I hear someone say that hugging is gay, I'll do a /me about punching him in the face for no other reason to establish that I'm secure in my masculinity.
<otakon> Wrek: are you gonna push her head up a bit?
<MadSurge> Sumica: I know of one indie tabletop RPG where one of the settings is a sea of zombies :D
<Magical_Pablez94> Sumica i was chatting with mah girlfriend!!!! :'(
<otakon> MadSurge: All Flesh Must Be Consumed?
<Unnr> MadSurge: AFMBE?
<otakon> Unnr: you know of it too huh?
<Unnr> otakon: Yeeep
<Sumica> 00,10the wow zombie event was fun till people started exploiting it
*mitamaking is glad he is not in Fluttershy
<MadSurge> otakon and Unnr: no, what's that?
<otakon> Sumica: that is the nature of the trained skinner box MMO'er
<Unnr> Once, a long, long time ago, I was involved in the kung-fu setting of all flesh
<Unnr> and it was amazing
<otakon> MadSurge: it's a tabletop Zombie game set
<Kandarihu> I heard all about that Corrupted Blood epidemic. I was a viewer of Attack of the Show when it happened.
<Wrek> 05so far so good
<otakon> MadSurge: it's got some good stuff for those who find zombies fun
<Wrek> 05a nice re-adaptation of the original
<Wrek> 05but more badass
<Rommulus> Wrek, derpy or AJ?
<Sumica> 00,10yep wrek, still not sure if derpy or AJ though
<otakon> Wrek: her head looks too close to the body
<Sumica> 00,10ah so it is AJ
<otakon> Sumica: it's AJ, I can tell by the colors
<NullRadix> Kandarihu: i think that's a different event. Corrupted blood was trolls, not zombies

<CrimsonPhoenix> Background Pony is simply a fanfic
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Ok.
<CrimsonPhoenix> better than MLD

<MASF123> MLD all the way
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again what is worse than MLD
<MASF123> true...well Cupcakes. :/
<cratorkid> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cupcakes isn't even a fanfic, it's a joke
<cratorkid> i was still freaked the f out
<CrimsonPhoenix> because of how gory it was and we shouldn't proceed further
<CCCP> CrimsonPhoenix agreed
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Instrumental Music: Night Magic / Heart of Flight / Spinning the Record
<AJIsAwesome> I honestly think Cupcakes gets too much attention. The video version is one of the highest viewed videos and some non-bronies I know become haters because of that video.

<FlutterMEDIC> Russians make some damn good music.
<Sumica> 00,10the last one was as well DashWithRainbows
<Rex_Mundi> The curupt capitalist pigs will be... repaced with less curupt individuals!
<Dark_Horst> ...thats not hell march
<DashWithRainbows> Sumica Just opened stream to check :P
<DashWithRainbows> Playing some C&C: TA right now before some TF2.
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, people who are willing to topple capitalism are corrupt already.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Kandarihu: :d indeed
<DJ_POn-3_> Kandarihu: yay for corruption lulz
<rdibp> :C
<Rex_Mundi> Topple, or rather moderately controll capitalism through liber reform policies!
<Kandarihu> DJ_POn-3_, no. No yays for corruption
<rdibp> THIS IS MY JAM
<DJ_POn-3_> what is playing now?
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, both are horrible oppression.
<DJ_POn-3_> i liek this song
<Rex_Mundi> yay for moderate policies!
<CrimsonPhoenix> ca anyone explain this to me please? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ns6egtq51r2tilvo1_1280.jpg

<derpy56> hi
<DJ_POn-3_> Kandarihu: i was joking though about the corruption
<Wrek> 05not too shabby for anthro
<Sergio_Scriptor> CrimsonPhoenix: i have no idea :|
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I have no idea.:S
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix ?
<rdibp> :|
<Kandarihu> DJ_POn-3_, okay. BTW, you can reclaim your nick
<FlutterMEDIC> CrimsonPhoenix: i'm as confused and creeped out as you are.
<DJ_POn-3_> i can? YAY
<derpy56> mooo
<Sumica> 00,10indeed wrek
<rdibp> philomeana?
<Rex_Mundi> To be hounest, im not zealously for any form of governmence, so long as it works and civil liberties are presearved.
<DJ_POn-3> yes finally i am back with meh original nickname YAY :) <3
<rdibp> MEG! :[
<Kandarihu> Yeah, that is nice.
<rdibp> meh
<rdibp> :)
<DJ_POn-3> plus anthro AJ is looking fantabulous :P
<rdibp> whats anthro?
<Sergio_Scriptor> rdibp: its a conbination of animal and human traits
<DJ_POn-3> exactly
<Rex_Mundi> Though I do think the USA neads more liberal and socialist policies and less Republican Neo-conservatism and oligarchic money controll of washington.
<Sergio_Scriptor> rdibp: like any of the mane 6 with human female parts O_o
<Pearly> aniam;s on two feet
<rdibp> :P
<Pearly> ferrel is on all fours
<rdibp> anyone a fan of kitty0706?
<Vivix> feral is animal like, anthro is human like
<DJ_POn-3> Rex_Mundi: yes i live in the U.S. and couldnt agree more or less
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, we are practically in socialism right now under Obama. And it's destroying us.
<rdibp> WHEEEEEE PLOTICS!
<Thrackerzod> ^^
*Vivix lives in a socialistic democracy
<rdibp> polotics*
<Rex_Mundi> rdibp: Anthropomorphism is humanlike characteristics given to non-human characters. However, when most people say 'anthro' they mean humanoid anthro.
<Vivix> povotovs
*Sergio_Scriptor lives in switzerland and has no idea what is the political order :P
*Vivix isn't quite sure either, but thinks its socialistic
<DJ_POn-3> Kandarihu: yes i dislike the government but without it there coukd be social anarchy so i dont see any winning here :(
<rdibp> INVISIBLE OBAMA 2012
<Thrackerzod> Sergio_Scriptor you do what ever you want political party
<DJ_POn-3> rdibp: does your nickname say rainbow dash is beast pony?
<Kandarihu> Government is a neccesary evil. What we need is only the minimum needed to protect our rights and absolutely nothing more.
<DJ_POn-3> * i meant best
<rdibp> DJ_POn-3 yes :$
<Sergio_Scriptor> Thrackerzod: then i choose Old timy monarchy :)
<Vivix> I have no strongs opinions about my own country
<DJ_POn-3> yay i was right
<Vivix> other than please not frp
<Sergio_Scriptor> *time
<rdibp> BEST NOT BEAST :O
<Rex_Mundi> Kandarihu: You dont seem to know what socialism is. In anycase, the United states doesnt really have a "liberal" (in USA terms) party, but rather a conservative party (the Democrats), and an even more conservative party (the Republicans). Obama is very conservative in many ways.
<Thrackerzod> ^ wat
<DJ_POn-3> i meant best mistyped
*Vivix shrugs
<rdibp> >_>
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, you think the Democrats are conservative!?
<DJ_POn-3> BRB gonna get some tea
<Thrackerzod> I think everyone is mistaken and needs to be ruled under a king and told to shut hte fuck up every once and a while
<Thrackerzod> just sayin
<Vivix> hehe
<rdibp> DJ_POn-3 is best british pony
<Sergio_Scriptor> Thrackerzod: i think the exact same thing :)
<Kandarihu> Thrackerzod, no. Just NO
<Dken2021> Thrackerzod but then he too will be overthrown
<Vivix> we have six political parties, all ranging from left to right and middle- I don't know shit about it, and don't care as long as my country works
<Vivix> the only thing I want is free dentistry
<Wrek> 05both parties of the US are so far to the right of the spectrum that there is no proper left
<Golakka> Porn music Wrek... Really?
*Pearly snuggles Vivix
<Sergio_Scriptor> MONARCHY OR DEATH
<rdibp> no matter who we vote for, we are still going to get a dumbass as a president :P
*Vivix is sick of expensive dentist bills
<DJ_POn-3> rdibp: Me?
*MLP_Brovakiin has free health care :3
*Vivix pats Pearly
<rdibp> wut?
<Kandarihu> Where are people getting this idea that the Democratic party is conservative?
<Golakka> Whats this you are drawing Wrek?
<Thrackerzod> Free health care = 200% tax rate
<DaringDerpy> both parties are socially behind...republicans try to restore the 50s
<rdibp> DA-DA-DA-DAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<Vivix> Taxes are fine, as long as I get stuff for free when I need them
<DaringDerpy> democrats the 70s
<rdibp> i like the 50s :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello FillyFlam
<Vivix> we pay 25% taxes I think
<rdibp> WHAT DO YOU GOT AGAINST IT!? :[
<DJ_POn-3> rdibp: u said DJ_POn-3 is best british pony? i believe is what u said
<FillyFlam> Debating politics, I see. I'll make the popcorn.
<Kandarihu> DaringDerpy, the Republicans are trying to restore the 80s
*Pearly nuzzles Vivix "hey there"
<FlutterMEDIC> Golakka: Confederate Applejack.
<rdibp> DJ_POn-3 you drink tea, your british :P
<Thrackerzod> you proably pay 76% of your lifes income to taxes in a socailist nation
<Golakka> hmm, I may need to buy shitloads of wreks stuff
<Vivix> I think, if you can get stricken bankrupt and loose your home because you got sick on your job, something is wrong with your government
<DJ_POn-3> rdibp: oh right'o :P
<Vivix> is 25% much compared to USA?
<rdibp> i love seeing arguements over the internet :$
<Vivix> well thats just MVA
<FlutterMEDIC> oh look, Winona
<FlutterMEDIC> nope.avi
<MLP_Brovakiin> DJ_POn-3: Hey I'm also british /)
<DaringDerpy> rdibp: http://i.imgur.com/iXLz0.jpg
<Sergio_Scriptor> rdibp: i know right ? :)
<Kandarihu> Vivix, there are ways to fix problems like that other than forcing the government over every facet of our lives.
<rdibp> :D
<DJ_POn-3> rdibp: i went to a website once called omegel and there was this huge debate over politcs it went on for hours
<Vivix> I can't really engage in the debate since I don't know american politics at all
<Thrackerzod> lol how about if you work you get paid and if you get paid you can pay a docter to fix you if your a lazy asshole you dont get a doctor its syimple
<Dken2021> DaringDerpy hehe
<FlutterMEDIC> DaringDerpy: nice one
<Rex_Mundi> Kanadarihu- The democrats have lots of liberal supporters, but the party oveal is moderatly conservative. Its just the Republican party is so far to the right it makes the Democrats look liberal in comparison.
<DJ_POn-3> MLP_Brovakiin: (\
<rdibp> i love arguments especially over bronies
<Vivix> Kandarihu, possibly, I don't know them- nor do I know how it works here now
<Vivix> don't shield rattle unless there's an actual flame war
<Sylandest> wth, politics in my chat. when did this come about?
<Pearly> why is that rdibp?
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, you've been getting your information from the mainstream media, haven't you?
<Pearly> Sylandest, I say vote for futtershy for president :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sylandest: i have no idea :|
<Pearly> fluttershy
<rdibp> Pearly: i just love it when anti bronies are just trying to further their argument when they actually sound stupid
<Rex_Mundi> Kanarihu- No, the mainstream media would want me to belive that the Democrats are liberal inorder for them to get more votes.
<DJ_POn-3> Pearly: because Bronies are superior to haters :)
<Thrackerzod> if you get your information from CNN or Fox your already wrong
<Sylandest> Sergio_Scriptor: right...back to writing then
<rdibp> i find trolls adorable :3
<Vivix> I like discussing horse anatomy and pony lore
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sylandest: good luck :)
<Vivix> trolls don't exist anymore
<DJ_POn-3> rdibp: trololololol
*Pearly raises her hoov to that one DJ_POn-3
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: me too,yesterday discussion was much better :|
<rdibp> whats a hoov?
<Thrackerzod> Im not a troll i just hate how kids think the sociaism helps a contry in any way shape or form
<Vivix> Sergio_Scriptor, yeaah that was a fun one
<Pearly> hoof
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, no. The MSM is in bed with the Democrats. They everyone to think that the Republicans are HORRIBLY ULTRAEXTREMECONSERVATIVE
<rdibp> :D
<DaringDerpy> the side that moves to the middle ground wins from the opponent. so in the long term they meet at the same place about most secondary issues
<Buytoast> SOCIALISM?
<Buytoast> IN MY MURIKA?
<DJ_POn-3> I raise my hoof to that as well Pearly
<Pearly> Thrackerzod, he yeah
<Buytoast> you commies better pack your yamchas and mozy on back to polar bear country
<DaringDerpy> 2 party system trap
<DJ_POn-3> how do i italize my text in the chat
<Buytoast> this is the land of the free
<rdibp> both republicans and democrats are dumbasses, i choose the idontcareican party
<Thrackerzod> Buytoast arrogants twards a contry i dont live in?
<Thrackerzod> thats funny
<Pearly> superior feeling feels good
<FlutterMEDIC> on the note of politics, who here hates Fox News?
<Sergio_Scriptor> DJ_POn-3: just write " /me" in the chat :)
<DaringDerpy> haters gonna hate
<Dken2021> FlutterMEDIC pretty sure everyone does already
<Vivix> I have no opinions on Fox other than the joke ones from Sipmsons
<Thrackerzod> FlutterMEDIC as much as i hate CNN
<DJ_POn-3> alright at the end or beginnign
<DaringDerpy> I don't watch Fox News, so no hate here
*Sergio_Scriptor is teaching
<Pearly> darling, yup
<DJ_POn-3> *beginning
<Rex_Mundi> Kandarihu: the thing is, the Republicans are in an identity crisis, the party is no longer the party of Reagan (who was liberal compaired to Bush).
<Kandarihu> FlutterMEDIC, I'm of a rare few who doesn't hate FOX News
<Dken2021> what's wrong with CNN?
<Uniison> they baised
<FlutterMEDIC> Kandarihu: welp, thats your opinion, and you are entitled to it
<Vivix> Never seen CNN either
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, you haven't been watching the RNC, have you?
<rdibp> Vivix: *confession bear look* i actually kinda like the new episodes of the simpsons
<DaringDerpy> name one that is not biased
<Sergio_Scriptor> oh god that close-up :D
*Vivix grabs rdibp WHAT
<Thrackerzod> CNN = the demoratic party pays us to suck there cock, Fox the rebulicans pay us to suck our Cock
<DaringDerpy> it's just the propaganda bullshit of a different pressure group
<DJ_POn-3> nope i dont got got it /me
<Vivix> I hated s19, but kinda liked s20- haven't seen the newest yet
<rdibp> i would rather prefer old episodes than new ones, but if they are on i watch them anyway
<Sergio_Scriptor> there are some good episodes on the new simpsons series :P
<FlutterMEDIC> that close up is just...........awkward
<Rex_Mundi> MSNBC and FOX are much more biased than CNN, CNN isnt pretty well balanced, just insiped and boring.
<Vivix> rdibp, yeah, I think some of the family values and "streets are dirty" things Matt liked are gone from the newest seasons- but they're probably still fun
<Kandarihu> Thrackerzod, and guess who gets the label as biased and guess who gets off scott-free?
<FillyFlam> On a side note, I think it's funny when the top comment on an Alestorm video is about Diablo 3.
<rdibp> i think Matt even knows that his show is going down the toilet
<rdibp> :P
<FillyFlam> It's like, what in the world would cause that discussion on that particular video?
<Vivix> yeah-
<CCCP> rdibp whos show?
<Vivix> Matt - I don't know how involved he is anymore, I know Al Jean runs the show, but he's been running it for too long
<Vivix> He's getting jaded-
<rdibp> Matt Greoning, the creater of the simpsons
<Dken2021> I didn't like that 500th episode
<Vivix> David Mirkin was showrunner in..s7?
<Vivix> that season was pretty good-
<Pearly> has anyonehas much success selling on pnysquyare.com or ibrony?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: he still is :)
<Iain> Hi everypony
<Pearly> ponysquare
<Vivix> David Mirkin is showrunner? I thought it was Al Jean
<Dken2021> hai Iain
<DJ_POn-3> rhis is looking reallt good <<<<<
<Pearly> hey Iain
<DJ_POn-3> *this
<FlutterMEDIC> hai Iain
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: they have several :D
<Iain> so whats going on the stream right now?
<Golakka> Wrek is wreking shit
<Iain> oh
<Vivix> I thought they had the showrunner as boss, like jaysson thiessen, and the rest worked under him-
<Sergio_Scriptor> Iain: he watching Wrek paiting :3
<rdibp> Dken2021: there was even a message at the end that stated "go outside and take a deep breath of air before going on the internet and complaining how much this episode sucked" or something like that. :D
<FlutterMEDIC> Iain: wrek is drawing Confederate AJ
<CCCP> Wrek why are you such an amazing artist?
<Vivix> with Executive creative consultant being Matt Groeaning
<Iain> okay
<Vivix> Groening*
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: they sort of like switch from episode to episode
<DJ_POn-3> Iain: @Wrek painting an amazing picture of Admiral AJ
<Pearly> hahais there like a link to this stream
<Dken2021> rdibp it still suck though
<Vivix> hm, I understood it differently from the commentary tracks-
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like some deus ex
<Iain> cool music
<Kandarihu> FlutterMEDIC, he never said confederate.
<Vivix> like Showrunner runs the season, headwriter runs the episode, room writes rewrites, including matt groening and the entire writing staff of "producers"
<rdibp> *confession bear* i dont really like dues ex that much....
<FlutterMEDIC> Kandarihu: someone said it was Confederate AJ earlier...
*Pearly hugs Pinkie
<Kandarihu> FlutterMEDIC, I know. But Wrek wasn't among them.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: it a sort of confusing medium :d
<Thrackerzod> *confession bear* i thought that star fox wasnt a fun game and i was bord with the sonic series
<pony85771> Hi, everypony!
<CCCP> hello pony85771
<Thrackerzod> in fact i still am
<robotdragon9> EY everypony
<Vivix> Hm
<Thrackerzod> hi pony
<DJ_POn-3> i wish i could paint this good what program is @Wrek running?
<rdibp> after 500 episodes, they have to run out of material eventually. the only thing keeping them running is pop culture references
<Thrackerzod> hi robit
<Vivix> yeah, true rdibp
<Vivix> the show had a sort of--real feeling, you know? Gritty- poor, etc
<pony85771> :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> rdibp: and that is sad,altough WHERE THE FUCK IS MY LENNY & CARL CENTERED EPISODE ?!
<rdibp> im afraid that mlp fim might end up like the simpsons
<Vivix> but as seasons progressed "Lets go to alaska" "k" and it just spiraled, and now its all about the joke
<Dken2021> ello pony85771
<Vivix> it might- but IF it does, hopefully after many great seasons
<FlutterMEDIC> speaking of pop culture references, i wonder if they're gonna insert us somewhere in an episode of the Simpsons
<DJ_POn-3> ANYPONY KNOW WHAT PROGRAM @Wrek IS USING /Me
<Iain> hai der pony85771
<Vivix> maybe~~ sometimes they're slow
<Rex_Mundi> The thing tht iks me about some people in the USA, is that some people seem to put the founding fathers on pedistools and worship them as if they had no faults or held posistions that disagree with them. Personally I have a lot of critisisms about them, like the morality of propergating a violent rebellion to achive their political views.
<Dken2021> DJ_POn-3 it's Paint SAI
<Apple_jack> wasnt there some rumors of south park doing a bronie episode?
<DJ_POn-3> thank you
<rdibp> FlutterMEDIC: i bet family guy is going to do that first, they always make fun of whats on top
<Vivix> Family Guy is still running?
<Dken2021> Apple_jack there was, and it never came true
<rdibp> i think it is
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: yeah
<robotdragon9> *confession bear* after playing so much god of war i cant stand any other interpretations of greek mythology....
<Dken2021> rdibp well technically, cleaveland show kinda made the referencefirst
<FlutterMEDIC> rdibp: eh, Family Guy is satire, could work it in any way they want it
<Vivix> probably
<rdibp> i found out that Alice: Madness Returns is just like god of war 3
<robotdragon9> orly?
<Wrek> 05america is the modern day roman empire
<rdibp> yarly
<Iain> anypony here ever played cod
<Wrek> 05and my best guess is that it will end as its predecessor did
<Sergio_Scriptor> Iain: no
<Vivix> yup
<CCCP> Wrek USA*
<Iain> I have
<robotdragon9> classic call of dut
<Vivix> CoD is hated because it is popular to hate it
<rdibp> i like call of duty, i just dont like its fanbase
<Pinkielover123> Is that Applejack?
<robotdragon9> *duty
<Dken2021> Pinkielover123 mmhmm
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek: Invaded by barbarians?
<Vivix> Hehe
<CCCP> rdibp its less anoying then bronies
<Sergio_Scriptor> The fall of the USA...it would be...intense
<Iain> Hi MaxTheBrony
<Kandarihu> Wrek, how would you like it if someone said that about Sweden?
<robotdragon9> EY MaxTheBrony
<CCCP> hi MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix i dont hate CoD tho i dont like the way the devs are working on it :)
<Apple_jack> Pinkielover123: i cant tell if its me or not, i've never worn that outfit before
<Dken2021> Rex_Mundi I guess ,we do have a huge amount of debt to pay
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello MaxTheBrony
<rdibp> hai CCCP /)
<SirGanjalf> evenin' ebeypony
<SirGanjalf> *everypony
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: i dunno no one has said it yet
<CCCP> rdibp (\ <3
<MaxTheBrony> Heya SirGanjalf
<FlutterMEDIC> debt we mostly gathered from incessant wars
<AJIsAwesome> SirGanjalf: Helo!
<Vivix> MaxTheBrony, I haven't seen the progress, I played it as a kid when it was new, and some MW1 when that was old
<Dken2021> hai SirGanjalf
<Kandarihu> In any case, Europe is a lot less stable right now.
<Wrek> 05my point being spreading too thin ending up colappsign on itself
<CCCP> Wrek Sweden is the modern day Roman Empire
<Iain> Brohoof anypony? /)
<Vivix> All countries might end some time, we shouldn't worry about that

<Rex_Mundi> Sweden doesnt have an Epmire anymore, its just a small faithless country of declining cultural and political importance
<robotdragon9> orgies?
<Pinkielover123> (\
<Vivix> Roman empire ended after a 1000 years?
<CCCP> O_o
<Iain> awwwwwwwww yeah
<Pearly> Iain, (\
<rdibp> I FOUND OUT TODAY THAT JERSEY SHORE WAS CANCELED! CIDER AND CUPCAKES ALL AROUND!!!
<thelonepony> Iain(\
<MaxTheBrony> Rex_Mundi whats up with sweden?
<FlutterMEDIC> @Wrek: much like the Nazis?
<Pinkielover123> Brohoof anypony?
<MaxTheBrony> D: Sweds arent nazis :S
<Apple_jack> Wrek: very simply put, we need a budget otherwise we will collapse, however the fall of the roman empire was due mainly to it was spread out too far and powers too thin
<Pearly> what's jersey shore (joking)
<Iain> \(
<robotdragon9> rdibp AAWWW YEEAAAHHHHH
<Iain> (\
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: much more then just 1000 years,like they wore arround for 3000-4000 years
<Dken2021> rdibp ah, yes, but rmemeber, something MIGHT take it's place
<Vivix> as a republic? I don't know anything about it
<Kandarihu> America is about to turn around for the better. The EU is teetering on the edge of collapse.
<robotdragon9> 5 minutes till movie
<Wrek> 05Apple_jack: you jsut repeated what i said a minute ago
<Pearly> snooki has her own show now
<Vivix> EU is not a part of europe
<Rex_Mundi> For one, I think it wouldnt be a bad idea to decrease the amout of military bases in areas that dont need us anymore, like Germany
<rdibp> Its just a load off
<Pearly> yeah
<CCCP> we should just make a virus that kills the human race
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: well not as a republic,but since the creation to the last day,they wore arround for a long time
<Apple_jack> Wrek: yes but the difference is, we are not spread too thin, we are inflating at an alarming rate because no budget have been set
<CCCP> and every thing living too
<robotdragon9> CCCP suicide virus?
<Vivix> ah yeah, Sergio_Scriptor it's cool history, but I don't know it
<d3rb> hey guys
<CCCP> robotdragon9 yesh :3
<Kandarihu> CCCP, genocide is not the answer.
<Pinkielover123> (\

*DJ_POn-3 hugs d3rb back
<rdibp> i hate history
<Wrek> 05Rex_Mundi: I CAN DREAM
<Vivix> I especially love diaries
<Kandarihu> CCCP, you're proposing the end of humanity as your solution to the problems plaguing the world. It doesn't matter WHAT the problem is, that isn't the solution to anything.
<MaxTheBrony> 3 mins :D
*Sergio_Scriptor slaps rdibp
<Pinkielover123> Brohoof?
<CCCP> Iain i mean its cool but the USSR is better

<Rex_Mundi> Love history, this game is my favorite http://www.europabarbarorum.com/
<DJ_POn-3> rdibp: its ok history isnt the best subject
*Sergio_Scriptor sorries and hugs rdibp :)
<MaxTheBrony> CrimsonPhoenix: That was an epic picture :o
<CCCP> Kandarihu life is wats the problem with everything, no life, no problems

<Iain> I'm in austrailia
<rdibp> 0 MINUTES LEFT I CANT WAIT
<LunarSS> It is a basic instinct to value your own life
<robotdragon9> im in wisconsin

<Barbetos|AtWork> Back in time for the movies.
<Wrek> 05im hitting the hay.
<CCCP> Kandarihu being noble is irrelevant, humans and all life are just an infection and we must stop it soon.
<Pinkielover123> Movie night!

<MadSurge> YAAAY
<Kandarihu> DERPDERPDERPDERP, the point is that a 13 episode S3 means they can have 65 episodes to license out to syndication. Even if they were doing another 13 episodes anyway, that could just be S4, and added to the package once it's done airing on The HUB

<ingwaz> and here is hoping that the hub knows just how popular of a show they've got on their hands. they'd be fools to cancel it
<SirGanjalf> Sentry goin' up!
<PONY> Strange hammers you have there
<Kotano> they're artists!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Iain something tells me G5 will have two different types. The unofficial fan make, and the official release. The fan make will be better in every way.
<AJIsAwesome> Family Guy's on TBS, FOX, Adult Swim and I forgot the last one.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just wish MLP was on more channels than Hub and Treehouse in here
<SpeedyBolt> Somepony should put that thing out of its misery

<Sumica> 00,10Frank (Bruce Willis) is retired, bored and lonely living off his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house. The only joy in Frank's life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah (Mary-Louis Parker). Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank
<Sumica> 0,10and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces Frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into Franks past and the people he used to work with. Like Frank they are all RED ... Retired Extremely Dangerous.

<Sergio_Scriptor> hum just to be sure Fl00tersh41 the side rooms never open right ?
<kidzrul434> I didn't really pay attention so i don't really care
<Tovler> infact. The Stream was horrible last time Starship Troopers aired that gave up and left.
<otakon> mitamaking: bc kirz won before
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Aw, man.:(
<rdibp> does anyone think there will be an mlp episode where they talk about death?
<Brony_90> are links allowed?

<Rex_Mundi> rdibp: no
<Dken2021> Brony_90 image links, yes
<desertman2> only images
<rdibp> good
<AJIsAwesome> rdibp: Considering it's also a kids show, probably not.
<otakon> rdibp: unless it's one of the very last or THE last ep to be made before G5
<Brony_90> No youtube Silent Hill trailer Liks?
<Rex_Mundi> this music is friom CIV3
<CrimsonPhoenix> mitamaking, kirzstryfe won the Bmovie for today
<Flyboy> has the stream gone back in time, or has the countdown restarted :|
<mitamaking> rdibp: no, they may alloud(sp) to it
<pony_300> That SH movie better be raterd at least R. All I'm sayin
<rdibp> I SAID GOOD
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: not only did he win it before, youre watching kirz's choice right now
<AJIsAwesome> Flyboy: Yes.
<MadSurge> I didn't win, SO HAAAAAAAAAAX :D
<rdibp> IT WAS JUST A TEST :[

<rdibp> :[:[:[
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle: sorry about that
<Princess-Luna-pony> Hello, everypony!
<JESmith> Well I take it since the surveys got out so late, you guys didn't have time to sort them out prior to the lotto. Thought I'd never see another big reroll again since you simplfied things
<Tovler> Congrats to The_Browncoat for winning the A movie again.
<MadSurge> Dken2021: too late, they already said it! :D
<AJIsAwesome> Flyboy: Because muffins.
<Buytoast> so i'm guessing the blues brothers is the hot topic of debate
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: about what? i can explain what i know no prob
<mitamaking> Fine, but Blues Brothers for a B movie seems a stretch with that cast and the money it made
<DerpyMuffins> Oh great D-wars is next
<Rex_Mundi> otakon: There is going to be a long amount of time seperating the end of G4 and the begining of G5, the shows at least.
<Flyboy> AJIsAwesome: DEAR CELESTIA...!
<somepony_else> blues brothers is a great movie
<otakon> DerpyMuffins: at least it's Rifftrax D-Wars
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Brony_90: Only image links :)
<otakon> somepony_else: agreed
<otakon> SuperBrony64: Lyra' would be happy
<The_Browncoat> Hopefully I"ll win B next time.
<Brony_90> can i get the permission to send a SH revelation trailer Link?!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02otakon: Ikr >3>
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Nah
<Cynder7> 6Meh,can't wait for Tuesday *.*
<Dances_With_Discord> :)
<JESmith> So if the movies are decided why are we running through intermission again? Why don't we skip to the movie now?
<Dken2021> otakon too bad she ain't here :<
<mitamaking> In 1983 $115,229,890, how is that B?
<pony_300> huh... first silent hill movie really WAS R.... didn't feel like it...
<Sergio_Scriptor> Someday i will win the lotery,and we will see Singing in the Rain for A movie :'(
<Ravebrony> Aaah, weeks need to pass quicker, i want to enter againnn :D
<Malk> Dear Princess Celestia I learned today that if you use a knife and hot water on a pickle jar it will open perhaps like how if you warm up to someone they will open up to you and then you stab them
<AJIsAwesome> It's funny, I remember voting for a specific movie and pony episode, and the person who won picked the same exact things as I did.
<XylemTube> So are we getting rifftrax again?
<AJIsAwesome> XylemTube: Probably.
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle: about getting in the lottery......one week i have to go to a certain side room, the next week, i have to fill a survey THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE.......so i need your help
<Tovler> only winning A but not B must be a nice problem to hav… *deletes message*
<prince-dari> What's happening on Tuesday?
<desertman2> Yes, since the other version didn't have any subs
<Agrold> Sergio_Scriptor: and one day I will win the lottery, and then we'll watch mutant zombie vampires from the hood as a B movie:3
<Dken2021> glad my pony episode didn't get picked, kinda goofed and didn't choose Dragon Quest
<somepony_else> my pick for the lottery were the secret of nimh as a-movie and bill and ted's excellent adventure as b
<Sergio_Scriptor> Agrold: cool :P
<otakon> Agrold: I could live witht hat tbh
<Dken2021> I'm still going strong with Kung Pow for B film
<otakon> also, Brain Dead WILL BE SHOWN ONE DAY I SWEAR IT!
<mitamaking> Someday I will win and you all will see my favorite movie, Metropolis(2001) or my second favorite movie Maximum Overdrive
<Malk> If I win we watch Thank you for smoking and super size me
<otakon> Dken2021: great B movie
<Dark92Enigma> OH COOL! This means we can ponify MST3K song! anypony agree?
<pony_300> bill and ted could be fun to revisit

<otakon> mitamaking: I saw metropolis...oh the tears :'(
<PONY> Tiramisu and beer is a wonderful combination :3
<SirGanjalf> So, what are the movies for next week?
<BlueFlare> 12Hi Cynder7 :3
<XylemTube> Kung Pow was AWESOME
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: well i think you need to be subscribed and receive emails for lottery tickets. it used to be that way, then for a few weeks you jsut had to follow the survey link here, this week it was the ticket system again. with the ticket system you need to subscribe to bronystate emails, to do that ask a mod, and youll get emails with ticket
<JESmith> Dark92Enigma: The side room stuff was last week only as a temporary thing. I didn't know if they would do that again this week or not. But they got the surveys out at the last minute yesterday
*AJIsAwesome hands SuperBrony64 a box of cookies.
<Tovler> My A movie pick was a movie you will never see because I'll never win the lottery.
<rdibp> did anyone hear about zombiu?
<BlueFlare> 12you should come here more often
<mitamaking> otakon: Would you agree with it being an A movie?
<Cynder7> 6Hiya ^^

<Malk> Sergio)Scriptor dont you want to watch super size me and thank you for smoking?
<pwny> what movie are we watching?
<Agrold> Tovler: what movie did you pick?
<Kandarihu> kidzrul434, wow. That would be the ultimate B Movie
<otakon> mitamaking: Metropolis? no not really since it wasn't widely known.
<Cynder7> 6I just usually don't bother cause I assume the place is empty >.<
*SuperBrony64 noms on the cookie
<mitamaking> otakon: I really feel it is

<Tovler> Agrold: Big Fish
<TheMonstaMuffin> :o
<rdibp> :O
<PONY> Since when has Starship Troopers been a B-Movie anyway? That flick is brilliant, and spawned two horrible sequels plus one decent animated one.
<Klumzeedragon> Oh nooooo.
<mitamaking> I hated Super Size Me, NO DUH on the food being bad for you
<desertman2> So...
<Dances_With_Discord> The hell

<TheMonstaMuffin> Here we goooo
<rdibp> shoebox
<AlienWarhead> Think outside the box
<Klumzeedragon> Did I just join for Dragon Wars?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Here we go :)
<AJIsAwesome> Klumzeedragon: Yep.
<AlienWarhead> Rifftrax?
<desertman2> Mind sharing the B-movie choice with us?
<otakon> PONY: campyness is usually associated with B-ness
<PONY> otakon, purposely cliché
<Klumzeedragon> Eeeeeew. I did. xD
<Dken2021> Klumzeedragon mmhmm
<otakon> Klumzeedragon: eeyup
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Think Inside the chimney!
<Quick_Thinker> will we get th rift this time as well or no?
<AlienWarhead> YES
<ArcherJoe11> Rifftrax, eh?
<Kandarihu> Well, if it's Rifftrax all the way through, I guess I'll be going.
<Kothen> Rifftrax! :)
<Polydunami> Oh dear, Dragon Wars?
<Quick_Thinker> YEAH
<XylemTube> Rifftrax WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle: JESmith OK thanks i took notes this time
<otakon> PONY: purposefully or not, campy is B quality
<BlueFlare> 12Good, kind of busy but good :3
<Malk> EVERYONE
<Tovler> Since Big Fish isn't a movie bros would rally behind, I can't convince others to pick it for me.
<BlueFlare> 12and you?
<TheMonstaMuffin> who is speaking?!
<Moopy> that was some mods talking guys that was crazy
*Tovler can't stop pouting.
<rdibp> what is this?
<mitamaking> meh, not in a Rifftrax mode, see you for the episode maybe
<Malk> EVERY FIVE HUNDREND YEARS A WOMAN IS BORN
<Applejack2012> Yay for Big Fish
<Polydunami> dat dragonheart reference :3
<Kothen> TheMonstaMuffin: It's Rifftrax
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03These are NOT dragons! :|
<Sergio_Scriptor> Malk: :D
<Cynder7> 6:O
<PONY> otakon, your opinion is free, but wrong, and you should feel bad.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: you can just make a screenshot :p or you can always ask a mod
<AlienWarhead> Bye Kandarihu have a nice day if you are leaving
<Klumzeedragon> I thought we WMC this thing! :D Why make the Europeans suffer it too!?
<Cynder7> 6I'm fine,thx ^^
<TheMonstaMuffin> Kothen oh, thx
<rdibp> WHY IS THERE COMMENTARY :[:[!
<JESmith> MadSurge: A movie so bad we need to show the Rifftrax
<kidzrul434> I wish they would make a rifftrax of Yellow Submarine
<Applejack2012> Spike approves
<mitamaking> Klumzeedragon: Did they last night
<Moopy> hey klumzseedragon whats up dude
<Dances_With_Discord> Ohh this movie
<Barbetos|AtWork> Douche Wars!
<Tovler> mmm, Boba Tea
<desertman2> they didn't
<MadSurge> WUT
<Polydunami> Because godawful movie, rdibp :P
<Dances_With_Discord> I love riffing it as well
<Agrold> Klumzeedragon: it's that bad, huh?:P
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: The title of D-Wars reflect the fight to become a Dragon, even though THE GOOD GUYS NEVER FUCKING SHOW UP
<AJIsAwesome> rdibp: Because the commentary has subtitles.
<JESmith> ...also because there's Korean dialouge and the subs only work with the Rifftrax
<rdibp> who are the commenters?
<AlienWarhead> rdibp it is funny and it has subtitles
<Kandarihu> Could someone ping me when the Rifftrax is over? I really want to watch this movie, but not with the Rifftrax over it. So I'm outta here.
<PONY> also, why do B-movs always have a commentary now days? We can make our own jokes :3
<Klumzeedragon> JESmith: Because this movie is... Unbearable if it werent for the commentary! 6_9
<rdibp> there are no subtitles for me :'(
<Malk> Sergio_Scriptor lets go get a supersized mcdonalds meal
<MadSurge> MEDIEVAL JAPAN, THEN MODERN AMERICA?
<Quick_Thinker> looks like the site of a bomb or an explosion
<AJIsAwesome> rdibp: Plus, the commentary SAVES this movie.
<JESmith> rdibp: Rifftrax. |You know, the MST3K guys
<Iwa> inb4: We dug too deep...
<mitamaking> Are the subtitles real or jokes?
<AJIsAwesome> rdibp: Wait till later.
<rdibp> :O:O:O I LOVE THOSE GUY
<Sergio_Scriptor> Malk: oh god no :d
<Quick_Thinker> WE WENT TO FAR WOAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Klumzeedragon> mitamaking: Yeah. I thought so. :D
<Fl00tersh41> MadSurge: It was medieval Korea, not japan
<mitamaking> Which one, real or joke
<Malk> Sergio_Scriptor its proven to be good for you
<Tovler> The original plan was to play it without Rifftrax, have it get WMC'd, then play the MST3K'd version due to WMC.
<Rex_Mundi> Im watching this movie with my Pinkie Pie and rainbow Dash brushable pony toys:)
<Dances_With_Discord> Dat Zoom lens
<rdibp> these guys are like bronystate but with a voice
<Sergio_Scriptor> Malk: yeah,sure :d
<AlienWarhead> Kandarihu I'll try to remember, but I may have to leave before the movie is over
<pikorar> Oh finally! The movie begins!

<Colt_Sterling> Kothen: I wont even
<pikorar> This movie is going to elicit SO MANY skyrim references from me.
<Barbetos|AtWork> The writers are lazy that is why CK|GW2
<Klumzeedragon> Kothen: Yup. I went deeper.
<Klumzeedragon> It***
<MadSurge> But will it blend?
<PONY> I first thought the subtitles said "I am 20"
<CK|GW2> Barbetos: That explains nothing! D:<
<AlienWarhead> Your element is the element of B movies
<Quick_Thinker> and how has the dad not gotten medic in the whole time hes telling this story
<Dken2021> army out of nowhere
<Tovler> good thing the scouts detected them

<Michael> omg
<Quick_Thinker> even the rift guys are saying it

<Michael> monsters
<PONY> THE HORN OF GONDOR!
<MadSurge> Suddendly Lord of the Rings
<CK|GW2> But then, everything changed when Mordor attacked
<Klumzeedragon> pikorar: Only thing it's missing is someone taking something to the knee.
<Agrold> I remember reading about this monsters in my history books. This really happend guys
<otakon> Rex_Mundi: pretty sure yes
*Tovler checks to see if this movie is older than the 8th pkmn movie
<Michael> WTF
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: I think so :D
<PONY> So, Korea had some mighty some Warhorses back in the days
<otakon> Tovler: it's not
<Fl00tersh41> And now for the medieval rocket launchers....
<desertman2> Dinosaurs with rocket launchers
<pikorar> Klumzeedragon: Don't worry, that'll happen. That'll happen, just wait and see~
<PONY> The fuq?

<SirGanjalf> CK|GW2: Rockets were invented by the Chinese in Middle Ages, so i guess Koreans could have them too
<Dken2021> pretty explosive material for medeival korea
<Tovler> Man on Fire for A movie
*BonyHepSits otakon will now be played by Stephen Baldwin
<mitamaking> which girl?
<Apple_jack> kindling and gunpowder houses
<Michael> seems legit
<Rex_Mundi> Fl00tersh41: Medieval Korea did have rocket launchers, kinda. It is called the Hwacha and its awesome, it was once on Mythbusters.

<SirGanjalf> oh hey Korean Uruk Hai
<CK|GW2> SirGanjalf: Yes, but those were limited use non-military rockets. These are the military sort. XD
<Agrold> Im surprised this isn't an A movie:)
<PONY> Dken2021, explosives and rockets maybe, no nukes or missiles.
<DerpyMuffins> If I didnt know any better I'd say Michael Bay directed this
<Fl00tersh41> Rex_Mundi: and they where nothing like this movies rockets
<rdibp> Brony_90 surprisingly, not that much
<AlienWarhead> Brony_90 giant army out of nowhere

<Sergio_Scriptor> Dark92Enigma: got to see it

<Tovler> Also Korra has done a few Rifftrax
<sub06905> dem tanks
<Deadlypon2> Why show him surviving!?
<Tovler> Woman who voiced Korra that is.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: NC jokes are billion times better..
<Deadlypon2> And then dying
<AJIsAwesome> This must be one of Micheal Bay's favorite movies.
<Somebronys> send da nukes.
<SirGanjalf> Wonderbolts are useless, from what i've seen so far
<DocSane> Deadlypon2: The fuel hadn't ignited yet?
<Deadlypon2> Docsane This is a MOVIE
<Thrackerzod> Well this is a normal day in LA
<rdibp> i remember a jimmy neutron boy genius rifftrax
<Michael> suddenly army
<pony_300> come to think of it, who came up with those missile launcher-mounted lizards anyway?
<DocSane> SirGanjalf: Wonderbolts friggin carved the crest off of Spike's head.
<Darf14> The Locus is invading! :O
<PONY> doesn't US have Urban Camoflage as a standard for any vehicle?
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: seconded by Independence DAY
<Sergio_Scriptor> pony_300: a japanese guy ? :\
<Klumzeedragon> DeadlyPon2: Because buck you. That's why! :P jk.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: :D
<PONY> Are they really only prepared for desert
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: I like ID4, but it unfortunately paved the way for BAY
<Tovler> The Rock being an actual good movie paved the way for Bay.
<EleanorAwesome> what with the commentary?
<Fl00tersh41> Tanks vs pokemons with rocketlaunchers, go!
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: Bay was around before ID4
<rdibp> is this going to be the rest of the movie?
<PONY> LOTR cast marching to the set
<twilight_sprinkle> bluarghbluaaaargh
<sub06905> this has full support from Michael Bay
<Sergio_Scriptor> i just had a triple deja vu O_o
<Pinkies4thWall> Fun Fact: Helicopters like the Apache can actually do a barrel roll
<Colt_Sterling> Carpet bomb > medieval army
<Darf14> Get me closer, I want to hit the military with my sword
<OohShiny> swords vs guns. Swords wins... WTF?
<Michael> not jar jar
<AJIsAwesome> HOW ARE THEY ALL MISSING?!:S
<Somebronys> inb4 the dragons and the swords win
<PONY> "GET ME CLOSER! I WANT TO HIT THEM WITH MY SWORD!"
<Dark92Enigma> DocSane: as a director?
<Colt_Sterling> Guns + Tanks > Zerg rush by medieval knights
<DocSane> How are they not mowing the enemies down?
<Michael> star wars EP 1 shields?
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: Yup.
<Dark92Enigma> STAR WARS REJECTS!!!!!!!
<Dken2021> OohShiny don't you know? guns only do minimal damage compared to swords
<pony_300> *fires tanks... hits nothing*
<sub06905> never bring a gun to a sword fight i guess :P
<Klumzeedragon> EleanorAwesome: Only saving grace of this movie. :)
<rdibp> OohShiny the pen is ,ightyer than the sword
<SirGanjalf> LotR meets the Star Wars meets the Battle of L.A.
<Colt_Sterling> DocSane: Shoulda bought Armor-piercing ammo
<Dark92Enigma> DocSane: with explosions?
<Darf14> Bullets! They do nothing! :O
<Sergio_Scriptor> OohShiny: sowrd won a lot of battles against guns,exept it was the one shot rifles,thing :|
<Dark92Enigma> the RAILINGS! THEY DO NOTHING
<Zawan> they have not even showed ONE tank round hit yet
<sub06905> movie needs more Wilhem
<Zawan> there we go
<AJIsAwesome> WE MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL RAILINGS!
<Darf14> The Tank Piolot must suck
<rdibp> i hope this is what happens when the 2012 doomsday comes
<Tovler> I wonder he found them?
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: First big movie was Bad Boys in 1995.
<Colt_Sterling> Sergio_Scriptor: this is fully automatic weapons with TANKS....Maybe the Tanks are using anti-tank rounds instead of the ones that work on troops..Sorta like Yonkers.
<Dances_With_Discord> Was this made by a kid suffering from ADHD or Michael Bay
<Zawan> still only one tank hit
<Klumzeedragon> Zawan: The tanks look like they're made of plastic. I dont think they shoot. :D
<Colt_Sterling> Dances_With_Discord: Its not so bad. :I
<Sergio_Scriptor> Colt_Sterling: probably
<Darf14> wow, only one hit, this military sucks
<Michael> holy crap with the missile
<Spitfire> rdibp: the 2012 doomsday is a bunch of BS
<Dark92Enigma> DocSane: Someday, the NC should review that one
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: ID4 was 1996.
<SirGanjalf> rdibp: I hope for good ol' Zombiecalypse
<rdibp> Spitfire: i agree
<SirGanjalf> Another Wilhelm bites the dust...
<Dark92Enigma> there we go! WILHELM
<rdibp> NOT WILHELM
<Zawan> ok maybr two tank hits
<desertman2> I saw a Burger King
<CK|GW2> Wilhelm twice! :o
<Colt_Sterling> Its funny. Ever seen a Tank shoot at a crowd of enemies and have it do absolutely nothing?
<Somebronys> dat wilhem scream
<Zawan> *maybe
<Fl00tersh41> Dances_With_Discord: This is bad, but it aint Michael Bay bad
<Tovler> What year was The Rock?

<PONY> Press "Yell" to be "Liberated"
<SirGanjalf> EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA!
<Tovler> When the evil Buraki becomes a dragon, he'll destroy the world. What's in it for the Atrox army?
<Darf14> ........Mary Sue Powers?
<Michael> wtf is happening?

<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: Eeyup.
<cowvarkian> Polydunami: yeah
<twilight_sprinkle> his superpowers also untie his rope
<PONY> Vivix, what does it look like?
<Dark92Enigma> No.......it's Sar-UH?

<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: I know. Just joking.
<twilight_sprinkle> double snakey all the waaay
<Tovler> without Rifftrax, I would have muted this
<Gamer_Luna> 2up :#
<Michael> battle of giant snakes!
<pikorar> Not as epic as the battle between Long Cat and Tac Nyan in the Great Internet Wars.
<PONY> This kind of snakes would have made Snakes on the Plane way more interesting
<Sumica> 00,10and then we watch cgi duke it out for the rest of the movie
<twilight_sprinkle> barrako obami
<twilight_sprinkle> *barraki
<AlienWarhead1> ah f*ck
<pony_300> there's a DOS game about monkeys throwing bananas at eachother?
<Dark92Enigma> How he would go against GODZILLA!?
<cowvarkian> ikr
<Darf14> err...... cant tell if the good or bad snake is winning
<Tovler> That gorillas DOS game was epic
<AJIsAwesome> DAT CENSORED BEEP
<rdibp> lets all admit this is better that twilght
<DocSane> I saw the new CGI Starship Troopers anime last night
<Fl00tersh41> Sumica: Isn't that always the best way to end a movie?
<PONY> Still better love story than Twilight
<Klumzeedragon> Everyone whoes watching is losing. More true than he knows. Even with the Double Helix of suck.
<Dances_With_Discord> This movie is awesome >_>

<Dark92Enigma> DEUS EX MACHINA
<Polydunami> I like Twilight Town, myself :3
<Fl00tersh41> The_Browncoat: Yup, why do you think it was hiding the whole movie?

<Vivix> I forgot rifftrax was on and was shocked out the loud voices
<twilight_sprinkle> pikorar: skyrim could make a decent movie i think, if you mix the story correctly iwth the nmagic, and choose a few good queststo be in it
<sub06905> movie night needs moar Twilight :D
<DocSane> MaxTheBrony: Is that anything like Bird Flu?
<TheMonstaMuffin> :(
<Dark92Enigma> DocSane: hate to say it, but Transformers (2007) Better than Transmorphers
<Darf14> Round 2

<Quick_Thinker> OH SUMICA HOW DO I GET IT?
<PONY> Colt_Sterling: that's what I'm afraid of... I made the bet when the Kony 2012 shit started, and I'll lose if there's no actual conflict by January... The deployment of 100 troops was a promising chance for a raise as well.
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: pics or it didn't happen

<PONY> cowvarkian, probably not, but at least they wont join in another bet. There's a chance for me to win about 1000 in this alone. 100 ain't that much, but still annoying.
<Darf14> RD is always the scout
<PONY> wont let me join*
<BonyHepSits> The Rifftrax made an MLP reference/10

<Polydunami> Repetitive
<AJIsAwesome> PONY: How was it?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Polydunami: Today's music...
<OohShiny> so much buffers
<Kandarihu> You're not going to do something that the FBI might have to know about, will you?
<Iwa> Polydunami: Modern music for you there.
<Polydunami> Really repetitive

<OohShiny> too much buffers
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah no this PMV is bad
<Kawaii_icybeauti> There are literally 3 notes being played the entire song.
*DrSteveSCARz Hates music from 2006-2013
<Aircrafter> This is so trippy....
<Quick_Thinker> very good use of the effectts and other things
<twilight_sprinkle> DrSteveSCARz: wow an entire year ahead huh :P
<Katalenic> DrSteveSCARz:2013?lol
<Quick_Thinker> so any music after 2012 you like
<CrimsonPhoenix> cheap effects that don't blend, lazy editing, and overall bad execution
<Kandarihu> The song is pretty much more about the lyrics, than the melody
<DrSteveSCARz> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah i've givin up, i only listen to classic stuff
<Polydunami> But what about 2014-2020, DrSteveSCARz? :(
<pony_2958> this is what music has devolved to, imagine in the next 10 years
<twilight_sprinkle> well there are less known songs that are good
<MASF123|> ded?
<twilight_sprinkle> DrSteveSCARz: awesome, i love classical!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> DrSteveSCARz: I keep praying for some music savoir to save music. Not happening...:(
<brony90> what about tombstones music?
<OohShiny> everyday I'm buffering
<DrSteveSCARz> Polydunami: The future my friend, music will have COMPLETELY changed
<Aircrafter> pony_2958: Its called DUBSTEP.
<AJIsAwesome> Does anyone know when electroswing first originated?
<Katalenic> dat quality...
<DrSteveSCARz> Kawaii_icybeauti: Its a shame
<Polydunami> I hope that's a good thing
<Quick_Thinker> unless the next MJ decides to make some crazy shit music be damned
<TheMonstaMuffin> Flashy
<twilight_sprinkle> DrSteveSCARz: i actually revently was arguing with a friend wh osaid that pop music has deep philosophical meaning and is as good as classical <.<
<Cypresswolf> DrSteveSCARz: Music from 2013? How bad is it?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> DrSteveSCARz: Yes it is...At least Aerosmith's new album comes out this fall...
<CrimsonPhoenix> nothing fits well with others
<sub06905> Dubstep? Oh you me farting transformers :$

<Quick_Thinker> YOU GOT A TRIFORCE
<twilight_sprinkle> i love that FiW song, especially the lyrics
<Sumica> 00,10the legend of navi pie

<CrimsonPhoenix> there's a simple explanation
<Quick_Thinker> clever use of link few sound effects
<Kandarihu> If Navi were REALLY that vocal, I'd find her annoying too.
<PONY> Navi has such a wide vocabularity
<CrimsonPhoenix> you're a toymakers creation
<CrimsonPhoenix> trapped inside a Crystal Ball
<Darf14> Game Over
<BronyInstrumental> and whichever way he tilts it
<Quick_Thinker> no phonix

<CrimsonPhoenix> a galloping glaze overtook my city
<rdibp> i love the sound of my name being pinged
<Moopy> i love brony heavan
<BronyInstrumental> so they shipped me off to the orphanage
<PONY> Kandarihu, the original was enough as it was, always suddendly interupting the gameplay with mostly pointless stuff... Specially after first playthough
<PONY> through
<twilight_sprinkle> dat marshmallow
<OohShiny> Rarity is jelly
<Pinkies4thWall> This tune is so catchy
<Quick_Thinker> when you bungled all your bangles and your loved ones have been managled
<Kawaii_icybeauti> so I dug one thousand holes and cut a hole with orphan foals
<Pinkies4thWall> I'd DDR to this
<TheMonstaMuffin> Which Admin has the green maned pony?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dem wrong orders
<Kandarihu> She only interrupted the gameplay a few times at first for the sake of tutorials.
<Pinkies4thWall> Needs an extended remix, though
<FlutterMEDIC> TheMonstaMuffin: Sumica
<The-Real-Fluttershy> Yay...
<TheMonstaMuffin> FlutterMEDIC Aha, thx :)
