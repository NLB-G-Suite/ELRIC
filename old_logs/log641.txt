<Dark92Enigma> NO I'M PATRICK
<RosePetal> I remember in Lego Batman that the final level was in the church. This inspired i.
<KnifeH> Ah well

<OohShiny> DOmino!
<fluttercry> 05,15That's right up his alley
<PwnySwag> YOUR A TOWEL!
<Noob709> Batman pushing down a set of benches. How uncouth.

<otakon> Ghosties: UNCOUTH? *burp!*
<pony_300> wow, how long have they been climbing

<DSNesmith> I hated it
<CK|GW2> Throw yourself next time to rid us of your stupidity!
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties pfft, fanceh
<DSNesmith> as a kid
<DocSane> Uncouth? BRAAAAP! Ex-actly!
<Rain> I like how he has to lean back to look up
<Ryunosuke> those bells would be loud as hell
<Dusty> next time throw yourself down
<Kammerjunk> I don't really remember it.
<otakon> pony_300: about 3 minutes
<Tomlpchan> > Finds shoe > Doesn't pick it up to smell it
<RosePetal> Finally the police arrive!
<Dark92Enigma> fluttercry totally fitting!
<Freefall29> hello everypony
<otakon> Dusty: Fool of a Joker!
<Tomlpchan> Fuck you nruce
<Noob709> Look out, it's the pack of health!
<Tomlpchan> bruce*
<Buytoast> the same stupid skeleton head guy that is shitting up super playstation smash brothers?
<Kammerjunk> But I remember the singing.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Freefall29.
<Buytoast> as reported by Kotaku?
<CreativePonyName> wtf tom
<Buytoast> er, Shitaku?
<Shizuka> 13i don't remember it either... not beyond it wanted to be "a bug's life" and the dreamworks face
<DSNesmith> all I remember was the pillbug scene
<Dark92Enigma> WELL, IT'S ABOUT FUCKING TIME
<Tomlpchan> CreativePonyName: Don't judge me ;-;
<DSNesmith> scarred me as a youth
<otakon> Buytoast: that is DANIEL FORTESQUE! HE IS A GODDAMN HERO!
<OohShiny> dat soundtrack
<RosePetal> Oh no.. what will they do?
<OohShiny> Rape
<Buytoast> according to Kotaku he's some shitty character
<otakon> Buytoast: I'm wrong, SIR Daniel Fortescue!
<PwnySwag> joker just HHHAADD SSEEXXX AND IT FELT SOOOO GOOD
<RosePetal> NO. not that.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: actually, it was pretty dissimilar to A Bug's Life.
<Wirisme> SIR Daniel Fortesque
<DSNesmith> I blame that and the spiders from the Hobbit cartoon for my bug phobia
<sentry> oh snap
<Crippler> ewwww pee
<Dusty> uh oh
<CreativePonyName> Tomlpchan: to be honest id do the same thing rofl
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> going down!
<Sumica> 00,10DING
<fluttercry> 05,15ah yes, the dreamworks face. I remember not caring about that movie at all
<otakon> Buytoast: no he's not...unless they made him shitty
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> otakon your arguing with buytoast you allready lose
<CK|GW2> Oh no, his flower peed on the bell!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Dumb Bell
<Everlasting_Joy> Ooops!
<RosePetal> BIG BELL.
<Meanwhile> I think if Antz is the one I'm thinking of...did they have a bit where their soldiers are destroyed by beetles or something and then the dudes severed head talks for a while?
<sentry> phew
<Tomlpchan> CreativePonyName: \o/
<Bronysith> we need to get Beauty and the Beast up in this bitch
<DSNesmith> yes
<fluttercry> 05,15and also I seem to remember disliking A Bug's Life
<Bronysith> that was an awesome movie
<RosePetal> You missed.
<otakon> Dammit Graham
<Dark92Enigma> He whizzed on the electric fence!
<Buytoast> i dunno, i'v e only heard good thing about him
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> GONG
<otakon> get out of the way
<Bronysith> beauty and the beast that is
<sentry> blocked
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Buytoast: Well kotaku can shove it, Medieval owns.
<DocSane> That was a sweet bell.
<RosePetal> Oh great now they can't follow him.
*Wirisme digs out medievil
<Buytoast> but it's Shitaku so anything they report is automatically garbage
<CK|GW2> Oh no, that will take at least five minutes to clear away!
<RAWRity> for one, it was a good deal darker, was more a Woody Allen movie than a kids film, and was just focused on the ants.
<DSNesmith> beauty and the beast is good for one reason, and one reason only
<Noob709> Joker saves Batman from the incomming pack of health.
<DocSane> SWEETIE BELLE, NOOOO!!!!!!
<DSNesmith> gaston
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh yeah push it
<Tomlpchan> DocSane: A sweetie belle?
<Midnight_Fyre> and now everyone is deaf
<otakon> you didn't like A Bug's Life?
<Freefall29> beauty and the beast is indeed a great film.
<Shizuka> 13a bug's life doesn't quite stack up against toy story or monsters inc
<Meanwhile> If BatB plays chat will be nothing but "Nobody x's like Gaston" all night.
<AlienWarhead> DocSane:S
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Welp, here we go with those incompetent cops again.
<Sumica> 00,10oh no the bell is slightly blocking the path
<RosePetal> Sweetie Belles fine.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: yes, that's the one.
<Everlasting_Joy> "All right boys. Nothing more we can do here, let's go home."
<Tovler> A Sweet bell pepper?
<Bronysith> oh shit Freefall29 be in chat
<Dark92Enigma> SWEETIE BELLE!!!!! :'(
<otakon> well it's goddamn Seven Samurai with bugs
<CrimsonPhoenix> Buytoast, or late
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<MrBen> Everlasting_Joy: xD
<Bronysith> Shizuka: toys story is best pony
<otakon> Freefall29: agreed
<Silverscreen> 01,11It's only a model.
<Crippler> oh yeah, one fat, middle-aged man is going to move a two ton bell.
<CK|GW2> Sumica: It'll take them, like, five minutes tops to clear that path. Lazy shits.
<Dark92Enigma> :S : I'm not dead
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Silverscreen: shhh
<twilight_sprinkle> dem lights
<RosePetal> lol searchlights.
<Ryunosuke> that cgi
<Buytoast> hell, let's just agree that kotaku itself is garbage and call it a day
*Bronysith puts otakon in a box
<otakon> Toy Story 3 is one of the most moving films I've ever watched
<pony_300> those lights looked fake
<DSNesmith> I think my fave pixar flick is wall-e
<Sumica> 00,10or just climb over it CK|GW2
<fluttercry> 05,15I think my favorite movie from childhood was Finding Nemo
<AlienWarhead> Bat yayman
<RosePetal> Where are they?!
*otakon breaks out of the box
<fluttercry> 05,15I cried
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: and Ish will change his name to "IshFastLikeGaston"
<Silverscreen> 01,11This scene seems vaguely familiar....
<Meanwhile> I had the bugs life tie in game on PS1. Hated it.
<Kammerjunk> Toy Story 3 was prett good.
<AJIsAwesome> pony_300: Early CGI.
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> Buytoast please go back to 4chan
<DSNesmith> partly because I'm a sci-fi nut but also the first half was fantastic
*Bronysith bonks otakon with a wooden mallet
<Freefall29> otakon: toy story 3 was great... but didn't hold the awesomes 1-2 had
<sentry> final battle
<Kammerjunk> prett*
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> puns
<Buytoast> man
<Kammerjunk> pretty*
<Noob709> Sweetie Belle is broken. Dead sounds too harsh.
<DSNesmith> wat
<Dusty> Wheeeeerrrreeee aaaaarrrrrrreeeeee yyyyyoooooouuuu
<DSNesmith> 3 was the best one
<CK|GW2> Suddenly Quasimodo shows up and belts Joker over the head with a tire iron
<Shizuka> 13fluttercry: Dory at the buoy at the end
<Buytoast> i seem to just anger you everytime i talk
<DSNesmith> I broke down in the theater
<Michael> omg
<otakon> Freefall29: are you kiddin? it was the penultimate movie
<pony_300> Aj: Really? Interesting

<Freefall29> I guess because of the nostalgia factor, i've seen toy story 1-2 sooo many times
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen The upcoming quote, perhaps?

<Canadian_Brony> dat showoff
<OohShiny> o.o

<RosePetal> Oh noes Joker is dancing.
<Dark92Enigma> OK LOLWUT?
<otakon> brb I think pizza is here
<DSNesmith> I was the only 18 year old there
<Sumica> 00,10boombox must be nearby
<fluttercry> 05,15But it was a happy cry. Because I'm super close to my father and it made me feel nice
<Wirisme> dat waltz
<Bronysith> Freefall29: nostalgia should never be used as a factor in judging a movie
<Shizuka> 13the ending of cars with lightning pushing the king to the finish usually gets me too
<shogipony> epic fail
<RosePetal> Dat theme song.
<DSNesmith> was trying not to cry into my hands and failing

<Canadian_Brony> :D
<_bane_> boombox is the best character in this movie
<MrBen> Tovler: You heard it too?
<CK|GW2> The fail is strong in this one
<oni_link> Tovler: almost XD
<Midnight_Fyre> fail
<Buytoast> although it is funny to see you cry and whine everytime i try to have a conversation/opinion there Quick Thinking
<alexxm> fai

<AJIsAwesome> DAT FAIL. :D
<Ghosties> 04*jumps at Batman* HAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH! *falls through floor behind him* AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!
<Kammerjunk> I'm not sure I liked the previous films as a kid.
<Meanwhile> I liked Nemo, but it was more funny than emotionally stimulating.
<Tomlpchan> So this is where Hasbro took their inspiration for the Derpy scene
<Bronysith> we need to watch Alladin up in this bitch
<Freefall29> Bronysith: I never said it was bad, but, I just feel it wasnt as good at 1 or 2
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> And Batman's kill count is now, what?
<RosePetal> LOL.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: meh, I never particularly liked Cars. and then of course Cars 2 kind of killed Pixar's credibility
<DSNesmith> pixar was handing out feels at the end there
<Dark92Enigma> MORTAL BALLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
<Meanwhile> We've had Aladdin.
<oni_link> Ghosties: :D lmao
<Meanwhile> I think.
<DSNesmith> cars was... okay
<Kammerjunk> I think it was that kid with the weird toys who put me off Toy Story.
<Noob709> Joey Dance would dance better than Joker and everyone combined in this movie.
<DSNesmith> cars 2 I didn't bother watching
<Shizuka> 13Up's problem was getting the trademark Pixar Heartbreaker out of the way in the first ten minutes
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: we need to stream it up in htis bitch anyways
<PwnySwag> Batman:12892348902189732189074
<OohShiny> thousands of people died at the hands of the joker, I laughed at their deaths
<SafariMonkey> Ghosties: lol

<Dark92Enigma> LAWL
<Shizuka> 13haven't seen cars 2.. haven't heard much good about it either
<DSNesmith> not the flying house, the bird hunter guy
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah, Cars and Up were the first Pixar movies that I didn't jump to see
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: you get bored of everything aniki
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Bat fail
<CK|GW2> Dusty: He doesn't kill people, except the large number of people he's killed so far
<MisterBen> Flash plug in crashed.
<DSNesmith> incredibles was great
<JESmith71> Joker: We're just like Beauty and the Beast. But if anyone calls you beast I'd rip their lungs out
<oni_link> XD
<DSNesmith> and needs a sequel
<Meanwhile> True.
<oni_link> that fling

<RAWRity> Shizuka: that's what the sequel is for: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6zirsTYdJ1r5zq6ao1_400.jpg
<Rosfox> bop
<_bane_> dat punch sound effect
<DSNesmith> it's a fantastic spy thriller pretending to be an animated superhero movie
<fluttercry> 05,15TF2 reminds me of The Incredibles
<Dark92Enigma> bop
<RosePetal> Bop
<Shizuka> 13incredibles was missing a heartbreaker scene, but made up for it with concentrated awesome
<CK|GW2> Why is Blade attacking Batman?
<RaveBrony> I went into Up expecting a grumpy old man, grumpy fom just being old. And then it toned down the movie when i found out Why he was upset.
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Black guy does more damage than all the white thugs combined!
<twilight_sprinkle> joker has the best villains. one falls through the floor, the other hits himself with a bell
<JESmith71> Can't remember if that line made into the movie or not
<Buytoast> This is some Sockem Boppers shit right here
<OohShiny> Bop
<RosePetal> Legs.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> BONK

<RaveBrony> Monster University?
<alexxm> batman just hurricanna'd blade
<Kammerjunk> I 'unno, I can't remember Monsters Inc. either.
<sentry> oah
<Midnight_Fyre> Shizuka: My big problem with Up was the villain. He really should have been a character to be respected as something of a hero. By making him a villain like they did it just didn't work
<AlienWarhead> woah?
<RosePetal> Except for Bob :(
<Dark92Enigma> SAY HELLO TO SWEETIE BELLE FROM ME, MOTHERFUCKER
<CK|GW2> DERPDERPDERPDERP: So he killed them. :p

<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties without it, you would have no air to breath and we would all float away
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> not a title drop its awesome a phrase
<Freefall29> RAWRity: mean, but funny
<Dusty> I'm batman
<Noob709> Shiny: ...Samuel Jackson?
<CrimsonPhoenix> >46e anniversary of Star Trek
<RAWRity> Personally, I still commend Wall-E as the most daring film Pixar's ever made.

<MisterBen> Broke his hand
<Canadian_Brony> welcome to the chat Shizuka. I baked a pie today
<BladedWings> dem abs
<Azuredragon> im sorry but joker being the one who killed his parents is lame
<DSNesmith> see I think we'd be more concerned that batman's about to kill someone if he hadn't already blown up three random henchmen
<Shizuka> 13wall-e saves the heartbreakers for the trash compactor scene and the kiss
<OohShiny> that hurts
<Metronome> Prepare to die
<Shizuka> 13yay
<RosePetal> dun dun dun.
<PwnySwag> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> lul

<Shizuka> 13Dark92Enigma: you can't do that, you rolled a 3!
<Meanwhile> Dem glasses.
<RainbowGuy> Qhy do people talk about penises and purple? Who's penis is even purple? See a doctor!
<DocSane> How does he even know what he's talkign about?
<RosePetal> Yes.
<CK|GW2> And this is why Joker generally doesn't fight Batman straight up. >_>
<OohShiny> he made him first
<otakon> what about the Plant scene with the big NO?
<RaveBrony> Heh
<Arby1120> This seems one-sided
<OpticalPie> they made eachother
<Dark92Enigma> Alo my name is Amigo Toyota
<MisterBen> "Yes, I would."
<RosePetal> ded.
<Ryunosuke> yes, yes he would
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> not ded
<DSNesmith> how'd he do that
<PwnySwag> lol
<RosePetal> Nope.
<oni_link> wow dat paradox
<twilight_sprinkle> hax
<Dusty> my name is batman, you killed my parents prepare to die
<alexxm> he would
<Canadian_Brony> pfft, glasses
<otakon> magic
<OohShiny> Hipster glasses
<CrimsonPhoenix> Azuredragon, that's one thing I don't like about this movie
<PwnySwag> win
<Fisheh_Fish> lol
<RosePetal> Hanging around Batman?
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's how they brought Joker in
<Michael> wat a tweeeest
<RAWRity> Shizuka: and of course, the last 10 minutes more or less.
<sentry> demon
<DSNesmith> the only thing I think wall-e might have benefited from
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> LOL GARGOYLE
<Dark92Enigma> WWWWWWHAT A TWEEEST
<Tomlpchan> Dusty: lol
<Shizuka> 13ofc
<Freefall29> that line was just awesome
<Tovler> not-deds always get me.
<twilight_sprinkle> this movie doesnt even try to make sense
<DSNesmith> was taking out the human characters
<OohShiny> lol
<Dark92Enigma> DAT GARGOYLE
<PwnySwag> stomp on their fingers
<fluttercry> 05,15No, the kiss part was where I lost it. I was holding it in well...then that scene just HAD to happen
<Meanwhile> You strike me as someone I could probably make cry, fluttercry.
<Canadian_Brony> dat hand
<Dusty> wow dumb bitch
<pony_300> I was in denial back in the day, but this batman definitely has no qualms about killing
<RosePetal> lol never trust the Joker Vicki.
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: What's fun in making sense?
<PwnySwag> lol
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> dat troll
<Everlasting_Joy> You're dumb enough to believe him?! Bat-aMan, drop her!
<Shizuka> 13the plant and big noooo are more overshadowed by building anger at auto and gopher
<Meanwhile> Not surprising given the name.
<Tovler> inb4 Frollo falls on top of the Joker.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> woooo
<otakon> ah
<Dark_Horst> now, if only the police force was half-competent and has something like snipers
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: its fun to meee :S
<Midnight_Fyre> He keeps spare hands all around town for hand emergencies
<fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile there are about 11 people from middle school that could attest to that
<Dark_Horst> *had
<Shizuka> 13given it's a small action scene with stuff happening
*Bronysith pulls out Meanwhile s nose hair
<RosePetal> Joker if you do that, then you will die.
<sentry> disney was inspired from the frollo scene
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: I'll go back to the line then :D
<Kammerjunk> I don't think I was awake and/or attentive enough when watching these films to actually cry at them.
*Meanwhile sniffs.
<DSNesmith> very few films can make me cry
<CK|GW2> Quasimodo's gonna pop out of the shadows and deck Joker over the head
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle make sense? Aww, what fun is there in making sense?
<RosePetal> There is his minions.
<sentry> I mean from this
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, making sense how?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Evelasting_Joy: She even has her own kill count for civilians, eh/
<Shizuka> 13but the trash compactor bit shortly after where everything slows to a halt to deliver, it's more effective there
<Crippler> now would be a great time to use the BATCLAW, maybe?
<DSNesmith> the only two I can think of are toy story 3 and return of the king
<RaveBrony> I cry easy....
<PwnySwag> check that dance swag
<Dovah> Good evening everypony, What movie we watching?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Instrumental Music: Inescapable Encounter / Luna's Song Of The Night / Relax In The Clouds
<RosePetal> She killed one civilian.
<Noob709> Joker's Minions are the masterminds of english language sometimes.
<Cypresswolf|BFF> Hello Everypony in main chat :)
<DSNesmith> the grey havens scene ;_;
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf|BFF: Hi! :)
<Noob709> The best way to speak english is to fail.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> kill myself
<AJIsAwesome> 263 people today.
<sentry> frollo death was inspired from this
<PwnySwag> KYS
<Azuredragon> I wouldnt trust that ladder
<RosePetal> Foreshadowing.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Dovah. This is Tim Burton's Batmn
<Shadeofblue> That minion has gigantic teeth
<Canadian_Brony> *Batman
<AlienWarhead> Dovah Batman 1989 it is on the front page
<otakon> eh
<Shizuka> 13"into the west" is an evil song
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> looks like an AVGN face
<otakon> RotK didn't make me cry
<Michael> ohai Cypresswolf|BFF
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: Hi! :)
<RosePetal> There i tied you up.
<otakon> Married Life does though
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: well showing at least how joker fell over the side, then suddenly had two free hands to pull them down, and they didnt see him
<oni_link> Bat_Quick_Thinker: IKR
<OohShiny> uh oh
<Michael> ohai Dovah
<Meanwhile> What can you seeeeeee
<JESmith71> And Joker realizes he doesn't want to be basterdized in the Schumacher films and decides to jump to his death anyway
<Dark92Enigma> By the way, you have something on your LIP!
<otakon> hell just thinking about it makes me a bit teary eye
<Meanwhile> On the horizoooooon
<RosePetal> You idiots stop! The ladder is slipping.
<RAWRity> Wall-e is actually a really good case of how to build up emotion in your climax. After all, the only reason we're rushing to get back to earth is because Wall-e is dying. We couldn't give a fuck if the humans return to earth or not.
<_bane_> retarded henchmen, derp
<PwnySwag> win
<Dovah> school and work on same day = not fun.
<Sumica> 00,10man just think of how terafaying that must be

<Cypresswolf|BFF> AJIsAwesome: I'm afraid I cant stay on long - I forgot my laptop charger in my haste this morning, but I have 1 hour of battery power left :)
<PwnySwag> win

<Shizuka> 13OHHHHHHHHHHH :3
<RosePetal> JesSmith lol.
<otakon> eeyup
<fluttercry> 05,15Saving Private Ryan also gets me pretty hard in the heart
<Dusty> not so funny no is it joker
<Michael> i like were this is going
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> NO NOT JACKIE
<Canadian_Brony> dudes!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Goodbye Jack
<Azuredragon> insert Goofy howl
<desertman2> He definitely killed him
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> NOT HIM
<Dark92Enigma> OH MY GOD, WHY NOBODY TOOOOOLD MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!?
<DSNesmith> man, even nolan's batman wasn't as much of a thug as this one
<Meanwhile> Hehehe.
<Bronysith> fluttercry: that is a good movie
<Rosfox> ded
<PwnySwag> YAYAYAY
<Canadian_Brony> Bring him over the building!
<CK|GW2> And there's ANOTHER kill
<Kammerjunk> Shaving Ryan's Privates.
<The_Bookworm> Welp, he's d ead
<Canadian_Brony> too late
<sentry> disney death
<CrimsonPhoenix> classic way to die
<Ghosties> 04No, no, the gargoyle killed him

<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf|BFF: Well at least you can stay for the pony episode.
<twilight_sprinkle> and then they died
<Dusty> think fasr batman
<otakon> but I sympathize with the one soldier
<RaveBrony> Ive never seen Private Ryan
<twilight_sprinkle> eht end
<Tovler> If Gaston could survive that fall...
<Atheist> EVERYONE DIES
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> batman didn't kill him, the gargoyle did.
<JESmith71> |Insert Goofy yell here
<Sumica> 00,10gravity clames another victem
<Freefall29> i'm yet to see saving private ryan
<The_Bookworm> Who was keeping track of the kill count tonight?
<Meanwhile> Haven't seen Private Ryan.
<DSNesmith> batman's racking up quite the body count
<CK|GW2> Batman blatantly murders dude in this movie, good lord. ._.
<DSNesmith> neither have I
<pony_7007> lousy*
<RosePetal> I lost count.
<Canadian_Brony> close call
<Bjornfot> >sympathize >soldiers
<SafariMonkey> because falling really works like that.
<RosePetal> They alive.
<magmablock> wouldn't the whiolash from taht tear his arm off?
<otakon> the one that's basically scared out of his goddamn mind the entire time
<_bane_> could have done that the entire time
<Shizuka> 13only thing i remember properly is the beach scene (who doesn't) and the guy with the phone that gets sniped
<Sumica> 00,10dat laugh
<CreativePonyName> his arm would fly off
<MisterBen> Mamgablock: Tell me about it
<Dark92Enigma> Twas the beauty, who killed the beast
<DocSane> And snap goes their backs
<Shizuka> 13and how... disappointed i was at the class' reaction
<OohShiny> Joker never dies
<RosePetal> What a fall.
<twilight_sprinkle> how???
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> even in death he's still laughing
<Ghosties> 04Hey, that's melodic
<Michael> inb4 he's alive
<ezio> l
<RAWRity> Private Ryan has the issue or more or less blowing its load in the first 15 minutes with the beach scene.
<twilight_sprinkle> how?????
<Canadian_Brony> "Swing low, sweet chariot . . ."
<Fenr> batman can do this kind of stuff,spiderman tries it and snaps girls' necks
<Dusty> 0-0
<Noob709> jokerlol.wav
<Silverscreen> 01,11This part creeped me out.
<Dark92Enigma> I'M NOT DEAD
<JESmith71> In a comic adapation of this Vicki asked what the Batarang was and Batman said "I guess the media would label it a Batarang"
<thelonepony> tus butey kill the beast
<PwnySwag> WHATS SO FUNNY
<Tovler> and then Joker got eaten by his Hyenas
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> must have reached termanal velocity
<fluttercry> 05,15Let me guess. They were like "OOOOOOH SO SWEET"
<sentry> spooky
<Ghosties> 04Could make a remix of that laugh
<otakon> Shizuka: desensitizing via the media
<Eli> tonight, the comedian was killed...
<SafariMonkey> dat looping wav
<Shizuka> 13pretty much
<Dusty> da fuck is that
<OohShiny> Game Over!
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat laugh
<Cypresswolf|BFF> I may have to convince Barbetos into letting my usurp his computer when he gets here :)
<RosePetal> He knew he would die for some weird reason.
<OohShiny> Boom!
<DSNesmith> it's a bomb you fool
<The_Bookworm> OH look it's his laugh box
<Michael> lol
<Shizuka> 13raised on call of duty
<pony_300> *when falling to your death, press play*
<Shadeofblue> IT's a bomb!
<fluttercry> 05,15:( I am Disappoint.
<Dark92Enigma> WHY SO SER-----
<Dusty> THE fuck
<otakon> War doesn't seem to have the effect on people nowadays
<String_Shredder> He had the last laugh
<Shizuka> 13some days you just can't get rid of a?
<AlienWarhead> OohShiny YYYYEEEEEAAAHH
<RAWRity> otakon: more like Teenagers wanting to be seen as hardcore or cool.
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties make it happen! It will be the new "Put that cookie down!"
<RosePetal> For now.........
<twilight_sprinkle> how coukd he survive that...
<otakon> that it did back in the 40's
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> BADUM TSH
<Crippler> hawhaw
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh that was a bad pun.
<OpticalPie> ...until you're two face
<Kandarihu> It's a laughing box... but why?
<DocSane> Crime is over...for the next hour or so.
<DSNesmith> best war movie I've ever seen is BHD
<Silverscreen> 01,11"A laughing matter"
<Dark92Enigma> SMILE SMILE SMILE
<Tovler> all of Joker's horses and all of Joker's men...
<Ryunosuke> he not ded?
<otakon> BHD?

<LunarRepublicGuard> meanwhile in gotham 20something
<fluttercry> 05,15Black Hawk Down gives me the feels
<OohShiny> Joker is alive
<Ghosties> 04Poor guy
<PwnySwag> CHUMP
<RosePetal> what.
<Meanwhile> LunarRepublicGuard: It sucks here.
<CK|GW2> A letter from Batman?
<RAWRity> otakon: it does to anybody who actually SEES the war. The people who don't experience it in some way never appreciate how difficult it is, or how hard it is.
<Dark92Enigma> GOODBYE KISS
<Meanwhile> Haven't seen that either.
<RaveBrony> Never seen that one either :(
<twilight_sprinkle> DERPDERPDERPDERP: i dont think he dies in this movie
<DSNesmith> >yfw the theme
<RosePetal> Hoorays for Lando.
<otakon> RAWRity: makes me sad
<LunarRepublicGuard> :D
<ShadowQuill> TWILIGHT SPARKLE FOR PRESIDENT
<Cypresswolf|BFF> I may have to find a best buy or something for a backup charger in the morning
<CK|GW2> ....Lando?
<Meanwhile> maybe
<fluttercry> 05,15Less "OMG CHECK OUT DEES SWEET KILLS" and more "Holy crap this looks like hell"
<Michael> dear gotham city....
<Meanwhile> Call him, maybe
<Tovler> I bet he knows a lot about Forces
<DSNesmith> >yfw the minstrel boy to the war has gone
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: this

<CrimsonPhoenix> dat Batsign
<Ryunosuke> that batsignal
<PwnySwag> LOL
<Forgottencrow> dada
<MisterBen> Dat Batsingnal
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf|BFF: You at BFF?
<The_Bookworm> Thus, the Batsignal was born
<PwnySwag> DUMB GIFT
<RosePetal> No he comes back from the grave in Dark Knight.
<otakon> DATSIGNAL!
*Tovler points at it
<Dark92Enigma> EPIC BAT-SIGNAL!E
<Dusty> daaaaa
<oni_link> Meanwhile: :D damnit
<Bronysith> ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<MisterBen> *signal
<otakon> DATBATSIGNAL!
<DocSane> What if it isn't cloudy, sir?
<Azuredragon> what if there are no clouds?
<RAWRity> People aren't desensitized so much as the never had the sense of it to begin with.
<Cypresswolf|BFF> AJIsAwesome: yesh :)
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Crippler> He uh, gave us his phone number
<Dark92Enigma> EPIC BAT SIGNAL!
<SafariMonkey> seems legit
<OohShiny> how does that even work?
<RosePetal> Thus Batman's regin as a hero is born.
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf|BFF: How is is there?
<pony_300> Harvey Dent: If evil should ever rise again, I'll be there... with a can of Colt 45.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> twilight_sprinkle: You mean for the Dark knight?
<Fenr> it's gotham,it's always cloudy
<Bronysith> i hate those CoD brats that think War is kewl
<Silverscreen> 01,11And the first time it was used for real, there wasn't a could in the sky.
<Canadian_Brony> Azuredragon talk to the NC.
<Sumica> 00,10bad news is we can only call bat man on cludy nights
<Tovler> good thing there's always cloud cover when the bat signal is used.
<OohShiny> Batman is always watching
<SafariMonkey> OohShiny: exactly
<alexxm> Azuredragon then they are doomed
<otakon> ugh
<RosePetal> Hi Alfred.
<Arby1120> That seems contrived
<otakon> agreed
<Meanwhile> When everyone else was watching these movies I was probably on haybales or in a tree.
<Everlasting_Joy> Was that a boom mike?
<Cypresswolf|BFF> AJIsAwesome: Alot of people are showing up :)
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: Classic
<otakon> poor deluded fools
<oni_link> :D
<ShadowQuill> pony_300: I thought it turned into a Stallion 45
<OohShiny> Alfred!
<twilight_sprinkle> DERPDERPDERPDERP: idk, but afaik he doesnt die like this, unless this movie isnt in the same universe
<MisterBen> Now, daggit. Why won't it let me change my name...
<fluttercry> 05,15I knew a bunch of CoD kids that joined the military after high school.
<Michael> alfred is best butler
<Dusty> umica lolz
<Rain> Sumica, its always dark. he will see it
<DSNesmith> oh dear
<Meanwhile> I wonder what the turning point of my life was when I started hanging out with nerds.
<Deadlypon3> MIrrister Waayyeen
<otakon> fluttercry: O_o
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf|BFF: Sweet! I'll be there tomorrow! :)
<RaveBrony> Damn....
<RosePetal> That's fine.
<ShadowQuill> Dat yay
<CK|GW2> Sumica: Good news is, Gotham is always so goddamn dreary that it makes the signal useful 24/7
<PwnySwag> GETFKED
<Ghosties> 04So, wouldn't all the bad guy have to do is just destroy each spotlight so that Batman doesn't know what's going on at first?
<Tovler> Don't play NC's Old vs New unless Alister is here.
<otakon> Meanwhile: when your snark overtook your sense of fun
<PwnySwag> inb4 end
<RAWRity> You've never experienced war in any real capacity, so of course you can't understand its brutality. It's why little kids play war and the like and play with toy guns. For their midns, it's a game. Or rather a competition. This more than predates COD.
<Shizuka> 13i remember reading an article right around when 2012 came out, about one of the mindsets you should end up in.. that you wouldn't be our heroes narrowly escaping disaster, you'd be one of the thousand little ants getting killed when the freeway collapses or something
<OohShiny> inb4 credits
<DSNesmith> welp, bet that rude awakening in boot was fun for them
<Noob709> The steering wheel is on the right side of the limo.
<otakon> Tovler: yes
<Buytoast> the signals are locked up
<SafariMonkey> inb4 film ends :P
<Bronysith> play one round of CoD when they are 15 and think thye can join the marines
<Silverscreen> 01,11Ghosties: that...would make a lot of sense.
<RosePetal> And so ends the epic story that is Batman.
<Dusty> Your a genius ghosties
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties comic book universe.
<otakon> Silverscreen: lol
<Michael> inb4/10
<Buytoast> and guarded by other signals
<ShadowQuill> Discord is best draconequus
<Dark92Enigma> BATMAN is all like: i'll just stand here and POSE!
<Sumica> 00,10or just crime in the day Ghosties
<Bronysith> THEYH DONT KNOW THE EMOTIOANL TRAUMA ONE GOES THROUGH
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> BATMAN BEGINS
<RainbowGuy> Night!
<HoodyNinja> Hey guys whats we watching?
<Ponies47> Moo ^.^
<XylemTube> Starship troopers next
<Spazturtle> Ghosties: Or just light up the sky so he can't see the signal
<twilight_sprinkle> that was dissapointing tbh
<RosePetal> Epic!
<Kammerjunk> Do you?
<SafariMonkey> boom
<MrMalk> She Said NOT A BIT
<oni_link> for a second I heard Indiana Jones
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Dat epic pose

<Ponies47> Gah. Chat derp
<Bjornfot> fluttercry: Good, then maybe they will die instead of some people of worth. Even if it is for a worthless cause.
<Whiskra> ghosties confirmed for supervillan?
<RosePetal> The end!
<Rain> but Sumica. Gotham doesnt have a sun
<Deadlypon3> ...

<HoodyNinja> GOD DAMNIT I MISSED IT!
<JESmith71> Devil in the Pale Moonlight/10
<PwnySwag> BOOOOOO
<Canadian_Brony> Silverscreen make sense? Aww, what fun is there in making sense?
<RaveBrony> 2012.... I hated that movie so much, hahaha
<MisterBen> Guys, I derped and I forget. How do I change my name?
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: That's the mindset I have anyway.

<Cypresswolf|BFF> AJIsAwesome: I'm in room 205 if you want to hang out - Its close to the elevator so between panels, I'll check back there
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> EVER DANCE WITH THE DEVIL/10
<DSNesmith> being in the military is less "horrifying mental trauma"
<RosePetal> GREAT MOVIE 9/10
<Noob709> Most vehicles made in japan nowadays have steering wheels on the side to the right!
<Deadlypon3> That...was lackluster
<XylemTube> dead parents/10
<Dusty> when is ponies? is that later tonite
<pikorar> CAPTAAAAAAAIIIIIIIN PLAAAAAANEEEEET!
<Petrified_Discord> HE STOLE MY BALLOONS!/10

<Shizuka> 13head to kansas :3
<DSNesmith> but you have fewer zombies
<RAWRity> Hell, if anything, CoD hasn't caused any sort of desensification. More likely, it's the result of people growing up and never experiencing warfare outside of movies and media. They didn't lose any sense of horror, as it was never there to begin with.
<Kammerjunk> Me, I don't have zombie plans.
<otakon> honestly something I shouldn't hope for happening
<fluttercry> 05,15I remember we watched Casablanca in my AP History class, and people just bitched about it being black and white and not having any action

Tim burton did a damn good job as a director, and it shows in the surroundings,,,,,,sometimes it's the music and enviroment that speaks for itself.......other than that. Batman was good, the Joker was a perfect match for him........it was a solid movie 7.5/10
<Buytoast> Not with Trixie the Transvestite Bitch machine

<Canadian_Brony> Rainbow Dash being epic INCOMING!!
<Yahooz> Thats why
<Ghosties> 04^
<fluttercry> 05,15I almost got into a lot of fights. Luckily there was always someone to stop me. It wasn't fun
<Bronysith> DSNesmith: dem facial expressions
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I do't want anyone thinking I j*ckofftoponies!

<JESmith71> That neon line magic
<Kandarihu> Hoofington?
<DIZZYRATCHET> no hate on spike
<Darf14> ....seems legit
<Shizuka> 13the theory goes we close lottery on thursdays so we can go through the list and disqualify entries, rather than suck up intermission time
<Bronysith> So many opportunities for me to get into fights, every single fucking time i do not
<otakon> Remember the Columbine shooting?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Tovler his father will hear about it
<pony_300> Trixie MUST return next season
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo then why the buck did you tell us that?
<Bronysith> I WISH I HAD
<The_Bookworm> TrixiexMalfoy

<otakon> I was making a comment over it to a friend in a private conversation. I was known for having major anger issues in HS, and I said "If I was gonna snap I would have by now, I have access to guns". I got called out of school the next day and taken to the hospital for physciatric evaluation. That I passed as "normal", so it was a free day for me.
<PwnySwag> yes
<ShadowQuill> spitfirecolt: same here
<fluttercry> 05,15that way intermission isn't 45 minutes

<Tovler> Jacqueline Fiona Apple
<Sumica> 00,10ikr Ghosties
<Meanwhile> If it /is/ rigged they aren't about to tell us it is.
<OohShiny> she can't do that, she just tied applejack
<magmablock> Notice that Trixie makes no attempt to actually show them up in any way, she just makes fun of them.
<Dark92Enigma> LIKE A BOSS
<OpticalPie> toothpaste mane
<ShadowQuill> Huzzah
<Darf14> HAX!
<Quick_Thinker> suddenly SHACKSPHERE
<Shizuka> 13if it was rigged we would watch atlas shrugged :3

<Everlasting_Joy> Oh o.k.!
<AJIsAwesome> OpticalPie: That's Colgate. :D
<AlienWarhead> OH MAI
<ShadowQuill> Colgate/Minuette/Minty Fresh

<Quick_Thinker> wait thats not how u spell it XD
<Yahooz> oh god, i remember when we cycled through 3 intermissions over movie picks
<HoodyNinja> bondage
<Meanwhile> As I hear it no one likes your movie choices anyway Shizu.
<otakon> I say the mods should be except for entering
<Darf14> AJ hates bondage
<Yahooz> hilarity
<Shizuka> 13and part 2 is coming... with like an all new cast

<RAWRity> fluttercry: a long time.
<spitfirecolt> go dashie
<Meanwhile> Can't say I've ever heard of Atlas Shrugged but general opinion is that it's bad.
<HoodyNinja> GOTTA GO FAST1
<Shizuka> 13otakon: the book was three parts
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: Problem is that if our movies are disqualified we won't know about it and will keep picking them only to have them cut out without our knowledge
<HoodyNinja> !*
<Bronysith> movies based on books rarely work
<RAWRity> a long. fucking. time.

<OohShiny> TRY TO FLY TRIXIE, I DARE YOU!
<PwnySwag> rainbow is a noob, rarity is best
<Bronysith> except maybe for the extended cuts of LoTR
<Quick_Thinker> how does that even work?
<Tovler> Sadly, only Hank Hill called RD loser.
<RAWRity> Galt's Speech will be its own movie.
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat shattered ego

<OohShiny> they totally ignore rarity

<ScarecrowGanjalf> All she needs now is a red lipstick:D
<DSNesmith> BEEP BEEP
<The_Bookworm> oni_link: Carrot Top?
<ShadowQuill> Dye your hair, Carrot Top

<RAWRity> fluttercry: that surprises me not at all
<DSNesmith> DEFCON 2
<Vordox> And then Green Hair was NEVER Seen on Carrot Top again ever again
<Ghosties> 04Look at it this way, Rarity: If you ever wanted to go to a rave then you know the color to go with ;)
<LunarRepublicGuard> poor carrotop
<Dusty> SHUT UP TRIXIE
<Joy> Green is not a creative color!
<spitfirecolt> oor carrot top

<Wirisme> Lyra :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: your comments are green! >:I
<Meanwhile> You don't /have/ swordplay.
<DSNesmith> I recommend epee
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: He says he is, but he is just a recycled neoconservative, not a libertarian
<RAWRity> Shizuka: which is basically the story of Romney's campaign since day one.
<OohShiny> lyra's face is epic
<BladedWings> chat derp?
<MD> :|:|:|:|:|:|:|:
<Dark92Enigma> Spike you make Trixie sound less annoying
<otakon> Bronysith: get Dishonored coming out soon
<Bronysith> DSNesmith: bitch please
<CrimsonPhoenix> Was there ever any doubt~
<AJIsAwesome> I never knew Laundry was sentient. :O
<Tovler> Green hair. Blondes-in-chlorine-pool problems.
<Applejack2012> noticed Pokey Pierce in background
<Sumica> 00,10yeah take note of the lower left corner
<Ghosties> 04@TheGreatAndPowerfulT: That sounds really boring
<HoodyNinja> Laundry is canon
<OpticalPie> yes
<ShadowQuill> TWILIGHT, IT'S ME, YOUR LAUNDRY
<The_Bookworm> Ghosties: If she wanted green hair then she would want a neon green since raves are all neon colors and glowsticks
<Bronysith> DSNesmith: i use katanas, not rapiers
<Dark92Enigma> OR IS IT VICEVERSA?
<otakon> also, anyone else getting XCOM: UFO Defense come October?
<DSNesmith> oh boy

<otakon> fluttercry: it's got MP you know
<HoodyNinja> double ninja'd
<Quick_Thinker> not the smart foals inn the school are they
<RAWRity> you know what everyone should watch? The Mass Effect anime movie that's coming out in november
<fluttercry> 05,15I did know that
<The_Bookworm> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> I gotta admit Trixie got a lot of nice quotes
<AJIsAwesome> *Snails*
<Dark92Enigma> Thank you Grounder
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm going to fail so hard in it
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Hey here is a schematic for you... MY ASS!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ghosties what sounds boring ?
<Canadian_Brony> This is what Trixie has done: manipulated a rope, spun RD around with an illusion, and changed Rarity's mane colour.
<DSNesmith> well the difference between an epee and a katana is the difference between a sport and a LARPing group
<Dusty> whether it was a good shake or not, I wouldn't want to drink when it was on his rump
<Silverscreen> 01,11I hated these two. They're the reason I didn't mind Pip in the least.
<DSNesmith> just throwing that out there
<Quick_Thinker> why do i get the feeling that they would be kickass at D&D
<otakon> Meanwhile: wait, like the japanese name or just what the stance is high or low?
<ShadowQuill> You mean the Big Dipper?
<Meanwhile> Sounds about right.
<OohShiny> Green and Powerful?
<PwnySwag> gettin fked
*Ghosties was just bouncing off of your reference
<Shizuka> 13fair warning, sumica's going to bring the lag back to lagship troopers
<HoodyNinja> Pip is best goat
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Dusty: I wouldn't want either of them near my food to be honest.
<Buytoast> stop brown nosing Snops and Snacks
<The_Bookworm> Quick_Thinker: Because they're sorta nerdy?
<otakon> goddammit
<RaveBrony> I used to practice swordplay.... until i got sick of getting bloodied up by my friend x_x
<Meanwhile> Huzzah.
<ShadowQuill> OohShiny: Meek and Powerless
<AlienWarhead> So is snails a snail farmer or something
<otakon> plese no
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh got it now
<MD> Why are they not shocked he a drgon!
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen They're like Scratch and Grounder
<Meanwhile> Which means otakon won't be seeing anything at all.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Dusty: Or any horse, for that matter.
<Buytoast> you two are stu[pider than mud in a puddle
<fluttercry> 05,15My school had a fencing club run by the German teacher. I wish I had joined.
<otakon> RaveBrony: why not kendo?
<DocSane> Snips's hair makes no sense
<twilight_sprinkle> spike is biggest twilight fan
<Canadian_Brony> Applejack wrangled an apple with her tail.
<DrSteveSCARz> I like pudding :P
<DSNesmith> >mfw people are using 'swordplay' to describe flailing with metal sticks
<oni_link> she can nowwww
<HoodyNinja> dat pudding
<ScarecrowGanjalf> AlienWarhead: No, he's just "slow"
<otakon> pudding
<Wirisme> that's great
<PwnySwag> PUDDING
<The_Bookworm> Aaaand then I remembered that I have water in the microwave for my tea
<Vordox> INSERT EPCI SAX
<Applejack2012> pudding
<XylemTube> Pudding is gud :)
<Crippler> the GRATE AND POWRFL TRXE
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but i like starship troopers ....
<otakon> noone doesn't not like it
<Shizuka> 13i suggested just randomly stopping and starting fmle, that introduces like three seconds buffer depending on how much your line is keeping up with mips
<String_Shredder> POOHDEENG
<Silverscreen> 01,11DERPDERPDERPDERP: Yep
<The_Bookworm> Brb guys, need tea
<DJ_POn-3> And I like Muffins
<Midnight_Fyre> So, did anone else pre-order the Season 1 set today?
<Cypresswolf|BFF> 35 minutes left - I'm out as soon as this episode is over :) save some power for later
<Canadian_Brony> Rarity turned a curtain into a dress.
<MD> :|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:
<Quick_Thinker> no they actually seem like people who play D&D... even though i have played with some uncommon D&D players
<PwnySwag> PUDDING
<HoodyNinja> GOOD IDEA IN 3, 2, 1!
<Dark92Enigma> OK I STAND CORRECTED! Snips and Snails are MORE ANNOYING THAN SPIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!
<BladedWings> The_Bookworm: lol
<otakon> grrrrrrr
<PwnySwag> YES
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<otakon> why?
<RaveBrony> otakon: My friend took kendo... I wanted to learn and he would actually cause impact x_x
<Canadian_Brony> Rainbow Dash . . . is just awesome.
<fluttercry> 05,15keep that in here though.
<oni_link> snails and pudding have a good thang going on <3
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, then you might approve of their role in Pony Fantasy 6. They take the place of Biggs & Wedge in the beginning.
<otakon> WHY DAMMMIT?
<ShadowQuill> They are dumber than a stone farm, because a rock farm makes sense.
<fluttercry> 05,15Don't tell mane
<RAWRity> Swordplay more often than not leads to one of the two competitors bleeding out from dozens of small wounds across their body
<Applejack2012> Snails must be half earth pony
<Dusty> *facehoof*
<CreativePonyName> he reminds me of ed
<Tovler> Focus, Pinky >.<
<ScarecrowGanjalf> Snails, you're thinking?
<Shizuka> 13seeeeeeeeeeekri
<Meanwhile> I lost my heart to a lagship trooper~
<Bronysith> DSNesmith: i actually practice with a katana,,not bladed but i wish i had people to spar with
<RaveBrony> *caused
<pony_300> the important questions. Thx snailz
<HoodyNinja> lol snails
<OohShiny> let's TAKE OVER THE WORLD!

<Crippler> Snails may be too Canadian.
<spitfirecolt> :|:|:|:|
<OpticalPie> "no spike, we're friends!"
<ROHKARA> So it's wrong for them to say Trixie's the best but ok for Spike to say that Twilight's the best
<OohShiny> I can't understand equestrian
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma snails = eugene
<otakon> RaveBrony: my cousin suggest me and him take Kendo classes. I was tempted
<LunarRepublicGuard> Dusty: beat me to it

<Dark92Enigma> USE DOOR AGAIN
<Canadian_Brony> TheGreatAndPowerfulT I'm complaining.
<Ghosties> 04Just a question, Dusty and Canadian_Brony: Is Canada full of hipsters?

<LunarRepublicGuard> *digs hole and hides*
<Crippler> Snails proves that unicorns run on gasoline.
<Yahooz> go slender off into the mane chat. im sure theyll get a kick out of it
<HoodyNinja> PLOT!
<RAWRity> speaking of martial arts: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3orkn8ORA1rn2llbo1_400.gif
<DSNesmith> fencing's not a defensive art, that's why i like it
<RaveBrony> I took Tae Kwon Doe when i was 8.... it wasnt fun at all.... I didnt last 2 weeks :D
<DSNesmith> it's a sport
<twilight_sprinkle> surprised they didnt go with the "major problem" pun
<ScarecrowGanjalf> ScarecrowGanjalf agrees with ShadowQuill
<MrBen> HoodyNinja: Yeah, would be nice. x3
<Silverscreen> 01,11I actually have a shipping fanfic in mind involving Twilight, Trixie and Hearts and Hooves Day. I might even write it one day.
<PwnySwag> Crippler true
<OohShiny> I can't see her cutie mark
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties depends on your defenition of Hipster
<Ponies47> Well thta was strange. I think I had to mcu stuff running at once :$
<Meanwhile> Unfortunately everyone nearby is structured by "rules" and "safety" and "people not bleeding"
<Spazturtle> At least she tries
<Ponies47> *that
<OohShiny> now I can
<HoodyNinja> Silverscreen: Do it
<DJ_POn-3> PLOT lulz :P :D

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Silverscreen been done read that
<Yahooz> RAWRity: ...shit

<Bronysith> RAWRity: holy fuck
<Ghosties> 04In your opinion, Canadian_Brony
<PillowPoni> Yeah
<Quick_Thinker> dah fuck
<Marx> Great. I was playing NES Metroid when I fell into the Pit of Doom in Norfair. Basically, I'm stuck and now I have to die a very slow death.
<Ghosties> 04Do you think it's full of hipsters?

<otakon> Bronysith: BAD!
<Silverscreen> 01,11http://www.trolino.com/image?id=50991
<RaveBrony> Then again... I never read any books when i was told to.....
*otakon smacks Bronysith
<Colt_Silver> HoodyNinja: first rule of fight club. u dont talk about fight club
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> PillowPoni: Yeah it's pretty good, the ending always sends a chill down my spine.
<Dark92Enigma> HoodyNinja: i heard of it....IS IT THAT BAD?
*Bronysith licks otakon s hoof
*otakon beats Bronysith with a pool noddle.

<Meanwhile> Pffffffffeeheeeeheeheeee
<otakon> typo
<MrBen> Ryunosuke: xD Love it
<Meanwhile> Noddle.
<RaveBrony> *wet pool noodle
<Midnight_Fyre> DSNesmith: And in college I had to read The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spencer, which I sort of liked once I got a handle on the old timey speech
<HoodyNinja> Colt_Silver: I'm not involved in fight club, therefore i am not required to adhere to its rules
<Meanwhile> NODDLE
<otakon> YES THE MIGHTY NODDLE!
<Meanwhile> AAAAHAHAHAAAAHAAHAAHAHAA
<otakon> XD
<PillowPoni> Ryunosuke: Well the B movie should cool everyone down after the A movie. Huh, huuuh?
<String_Shredder> Silverscreen: You ain't got no pancake mix!
<Buytoast> goddamn everyone keeps talking about Battle Society
<Dark92Enigma> HoodyNinja: because apparently, you're going nuts the wrong way, if you know what i mean
<Shizuka> 13who stole my pool noodle :<
<PillowPoni> Ryunosuke: *nudge nudge*
<Meanwhile> Fucking noddle.
<EleanorAwesome> yay I made it
<Meanwhile> Dear lord otakon.
<RaveBrony> o.o
<otakon> now I have to come up with what a noddle is...
<EleanorAwesome> For the intermission
<DSNesmith> my seminar prof last semester tried to make us read, uh... I don't even remember the name of it
<otakon> Shizuka: no no, a noddle
<HoodyNinja> EleanorAwesome: You missed bat man
<RAWRity> Shizuka: otakon did it >_>
<Vordox> PillowPoni: I think we can enjoy a STALE movie! (Ha ha ha... >_>)
<otakon> NOT a noodle
<Colt_Silver> what r we watching now?
<Shizuka> 13oh
<DSNesmith> it was really bad though
<Bronysith> otakon: when a women and a table love eachotehr very much...
<Sumica> 00,10wonder if I can set a script to kick on saying the name of the A movie
<otakon> XD
<MrBen> Oh, I have a question
<AJIsAwesome> I never knew talking about the A movie was kickable. Why didn't anyone tell me?
<otakon> NO
<Ryunosuke> PillowPoni, it should BRRRRRRRing in some laughs I admit
<RAWRity> Shizuka: he wanted to get in and see daribot again >_>
<otakon> that is NOT a noddle
<Colt_Silver> Sumica: "The A Movie"
<RaveBrony> O_O
<Dark92Enigma> HoodyNinja: how is that movie?
<DSNesmith> Mrs. Dalloway
<EleanorAwesome> I knowwwww I was at the McDonald
<fluttercry> 05,15But....The Great Gatsby was my favorite thing from 11th grade
<DSNesmith> terrible fucking book
<Meanwhile> Dude, noddle is slang for skull.
<HoodyNinja> Sumica: The A movie? You mean Fight Club? I love that movie
<DashWithRainbows> Sumica And then next week's BMN is nothing but kicks.
<DashWithRainbows> Do it.
<otakon> RAWRity: dude, we should do a reading of "The Moderator" one day
<MrBen> What about Combat Establishment's similarly named aerial group members, Flight Club?
<Dark92Enigma> EleanorAwesome: there's always Euro Night
<HoodyNinja> Dark92Enigma: Awesome
<Sumica> 00,10that joke dont work with the way I worded it Colt_Silver, nice try
<fluttercry> 05,15Sumica probably
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03...That sounds pretty nifty! DO IT!
<Algol> iirc
<RaveBrony> You all and your books :D
<PillowPoni> Vordox, Ryunosuke: They'll be frozen in their seats
<otakon> RAWRity: for those with mics anyway, which is most of us IIRC
<PillowPoni> *tries*
<Algol> this was discussed
<RaveBrony> I need to read more....
<Bronysith> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/ManUp.jpg DARI
<Algol> various times
<DSNesmith> Crime and Punishment was good for the first half and the very end
<RAWRity> fluttercry: I liked it too. It's certainly beter than "Their Eyes Were Watching God" that year.
<otakon> ugh
<Kandarihu> Strife Bludgeon
<DSNesmith> but that last quarter or so was just painfully slow
<Dark92Enigma> HoodyNinja: REALLY!? I'M IN FOR A TREAT! :)
<EleanorAwesome> You're right, thanks
<Colt_Silver> so we're watching Batman right now? I just got here so i dunno
<Ryunosuke> well we know what meme will be overused next week :)
<otakon> I didn't like TEWWG either
<Vordox> PillowPoni: Indeed, it's quite a chilly public response.
<otakon> I didn't get it
<Meanwhile> Akin to noggin, or cap, the brainbone, topper, or me' old mug.

<HoodyNinja> dem railings
<Shizuka> 13i remember being okay with the glass menagerie
<JESmith71> Then people will get confused who don't read the front page. What's the A movie? "We can't say it!"
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, next week? We're overusing it NOW
<Ryunosuke> I snow it will bring in the usual meme
<RaveBrony> Only books I've read: The Hot Zone, and Ender's Game.....
<otakon> Things Fall Apart
<DashWithRainbows> Ryunosuke What is this 'meme' you speak of?
<DSNesmith> fuck
<DSNesmith> that
<DSNesmith> book
<otakon> actually that one wasn't bad
<fluttercry> 05,15Things Fall Apart can go die
<JESmith71> Colt_Silver: It was the A so you missed it
<DSNesmith> seriously fuck that book
<fluttercry> 05,15I hated that book
<otakon> Ah, Ender's Game
<Algol> really?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: I didn't have Menagerie until Senior year.
<otakon> wow really?
<Bronysith> RAWRity: FUND IT
<Shizuka> 13things fall apart was boring as hell
<Algol> I loved that book
<Ryunosuke> inb4
<Ryunosuke> err
<Midnight_Fyre> In Junior High I had to read a novella called The Human Comedy, which I absolutely hated
<BladedWings> be back in a little bit guys
<LunarRepublicGuard> *open free cookies stand*
<PillowPoni> Vordox: Such a stone-cold theater
<Shizuka> 13yeah i think it was senior for me too
<HoodyNinja> JESmith71: The A movie is Fight Club
<Ryunosuke> inb4 I WAS FROZEN TODAY
<desertman2> shh
<Colt_Silver> Did u guys hear about the Raritylicios vid? I heard Tabitha did the voice herself for the animation
<otakon> I liked it
<AJIsAwesome> Did I miss a day where talking about the A movie was unallowed? :S
<HoodyNinja> bye BladedWings
<otakon> I didn't love it
<NullRadix> Ryunosuke: oh don't be so down about it, I'm sure it will be ice
<Shizuka> 13i read one for a history class called red dust i think?
<Meanwhile> And I have read none of this stuff, again presumably because unlike the rest of you I'm not a tremendous nerd.
<Colt_Silver> SO IM IN TIME FOR STARSHIP TROOPERS!!? WOOOO!!
<Dark92Enigma> OK............A little side note: TOMMOROW NIGHT, the ENCORE PRESENTATION OF THE CANTERLOT ROYAL WEDDING WILL BROADCAST ON THE HUB TOMMORROW MORNING!!!!!
<otakon> but it wasn't a chore to read
<Shizuka> 13was about apartheid
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> HoodyNinja: You fool, what have you done?!
<Dken2021> ah, in time for the B film'
<ScarecrowGanjalf> Cool, i was proposing the A movie previous week:) (In wrong place, and it was more of a test, but still)
<Silverscreen> 01,11I went home for Labor Day weekend to get away from Campus. Ended up doing work all Saturday and Sunday anyway. I get into a fender bender on my way home on Monday that f**ked up the right side of my car. Tuesday I find out that it'd cost over $500 to fix said right side. Wednesday I started getting sick and I only get half the work done that I should have done. And today I foundnd
<Silverscreen> 1,11out that my bank screwed me over and I now owe them $120 dollars in addition to being sick as hell.
<Dark92Enigma> TOMORROW MORNING*
<Vordox> PillowPoni: Even reviewers showed a cold shoulder.
<RAWRity> Senior Year also had Mama Day, Anil's Ghost, The Things They Carried, Hamlet, Twelfth Night, and A Streetcar Named Desire
<DSNesmith> things fall apart was a shitty book about a shitty character, with a shitty moral it shoved down your throat, and had shitty prose, and a shitty plot
<otakon> Meanwhile: or you weren't assigned bookwork like us in High School
<MrBen> AJIsAwesome: It's supposed to be a joke regarding the A movie for next week, Fight Club.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03what a story, mark
<ScarecrowGanjalf> And what's the B movie, BTW?
<Dken2021> aww that sucks Silverscreen
<otakon> DSNesmith: so you're saying it was....?
<otakon> Shitty right?
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: to be fair, the shitty prose is the fault of shitty translation.
<Meanwhile> otakon my high school English teacher once told me "You are a horrible bully, go away."
<Ryunosuke> PillowPoni, I am actually kinda cool with next weeks b movie
*Bronysith puts otakon in a full nelson
<AJIsAwesome> MrBen: Well, how was I supposed to know? I thought they were just joking around. :S
<pony_300> the funny thing is, tyler kept saying never to talk about it because he *wanted* them to talk about it.
<Colt_Silver> Silverscreen: go on..
*otakon dodges
<DSNesmith> okonkwo is the least likeable character I have ever read about
<Shizuka> 13the only thing i remember from things fall apart is the main character is okonkwo
<otakon> yes
<HoodyNinja> Silverscreen: When life gets you down, get up and kick life in the face!
<Azuredragon> Prepare your toots
<Noob709> Oh? Are we watching what it's really called in Discordia "Starship Bloopers"?
<otakon> DSNesmith: but that is NOT the point
<Shizuka> 13and there's a 419 scam email in doom 3 from an okonkwo
<MrBen> AJIsAwesome: Well, because to be honest, I'm not sure if they're NOT joking, myself...
<RAWRity> DSNesmith: so you've enver read American Psycho I take it.
<fluttercry> 05,15Senior Year I read Things Fall Apart, Beowulf, Dante's Inferno, The Stranger, The Metamorphosis, and Hamlet. I loved all but the first
<String_Shredder> Scoot-Scootaloo: I did Naught hit hehr, ees bullshit, i did naught
<Ryunosuke> inb4 toot spam
<otakon> ah, Beowolf
<Dark92Enigma> AGAIN: Tommorrow is the ENCORE PRENSENTATION of the Royal Wedding.......just in case you all want to RELIVE THE MOMENT!
<DSNesmith> bateman is at least entrancingly evil
<AJIsAwesome> MrBen: Okay, thanks for letting me know.
<Colt_Silver> Silverscreen: ouch.
<Algol> I've read only the first
<otakon> we had to read the old version
<DSNesmith> okonkwo is just a brute
<MrBen> Silverscreen: Shit, son. Forget a hug, you need a full on full body massage.
<JESmith71> HoodyNinja: I know, but Sumi and the others are joking (I hope it was a joke) about using a kick script if you say the movie's name. Hence we'd get a bunch of kicks if people come in asking "What's he A movie?"
<otakon> ARGH!
<Meanwhile> If I ever did work in English it was doodling in the margin and taping signs to people.
<Silverscreen> 01,11I stayed home and slept half of today away. The other half I left to see The Avengers, paid for with pocket money.
<MrBen> AJIsAwesome: No problem.
<Shizuka> 13i have the stranger on kindle but haven't gotten to it
<otakon> I hated the old version of Beowulf
<NullRadix> HoodyNinja: no no no, that doesn't rhyme... When Life Gets you Down, You Take it to Town!
<PillowPoni> Vordox, Ryunosuke: The crowd's reactions are polar
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Well I'm out, goodbye folks.
<Shizuka> 13metamorphosis i think we did
<Algol> I was assigned Madame Bovary
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen damn those beaurecrats---
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: Ever have to read any Chaucer?
<DSNesmith> I would rather read heart of darkness again than things fall apart
<AJIsAwesome> *Sigh* now I'm depressed a little bit.
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh yeah we read The 13th Warrior too
<HoodyNinja> JESmith71: The A movie? You mean Fight Club?
<otakon> I read that in a Reader's Digest actually
<Jim> ermahgerd, my train is just half an hour away
<Shizuka> 13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dust_(novel) ha i was right
<otakon> fluttercry: -_____-
<Sumica> 00,10Problem?
<BerryPunch> Title on en.wikipedia.org: Red Dust (novel) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
<DSNesmith> and heart of darkness sucked
<fluttercry> 05,15Midnight_Fyre yes we had to read Canterbury Tales
<RAWRity> Funfact: for English senior year, my friends and I had to make a Parody movie of Hamlet, and it had to be at least 30 mins long. We made outs 60 just to piss off the teacher.
<Shizuka> 13problem?
<Shizuka> 13where
<Silverscreen> 01,11A moment of silence for my suffering? :P
<Shizuka> 13i will end it
<Bronysith> ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<RAWRity> *ours
<Algol> good lord, I wanted to strangle everyone in my English class for liking that book
<Bronysith> i have so many games on my "To play list"
<otakon> RAWRity: you are a magnificent bastard :)
<Dken2021> RAWRity lol
<PillowPoni> Where was Gondor when banned for saying the A movie title?
<Kandarihu> Problem?
<otakon> Bronysith: Borderlands 2?
<DSNesmith> metamorphosis was good, but depressing
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, thanks for reminding us. I'll really be looking forward to watching for a Season 3 announcement.
<Algol> Tess of the D'Ubervilles > Bovary
<MrBen> HAHAHAHAHA! NINJA'D BY THE MODS! I love it! Respect +20
<Vordox> DAMNIT Sumica :D
<Dark92Enigma> Everypony, a moment of silence for Silverscreen
<CrimsonPhoenix> No Toot spam?
<otakon> DSNesmith: eeyup, and it's circular at that
<Reactor> Thank you so much for that!
<HoodyNinja> Lol got us good

<OohShiny> no toot spam today
<Buytoast> i swear
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronystate I am proud
<fluttercry> 05,15We had a project to make our own circles of Hell. It was the best project ever because I got to list types of people that pissed me off and how I would punish them
<Buytoast> i will end you
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: you cut off one of the channels don't you
<otakon> Bronysith: I don't have the money atm
*Vordox gives Silverscreen and Scoot-Scootaloo a hugzie.
<fluttercry> 05,15Got 100 on that
<Shizuka> 13lost like half the synth there
<Colt_Silver> sumi
<DSNesmith> all the "oppressed minority group" books were generally terrible
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: 13th Warrior (Eaters of the Dead) is a great book. Michael Crichton (RIP) was a great writer. Too bad the movie, like most Crichton films, was crap
<Silverscreen> 01,11I've actually entertained the idea of making my fanfic a clopfic.
<Colt_Silver> sumica
<Bronysith> otakon: i have to play legend of dragoon, FFVIII, shadow of the colossus,
<Pearly> hey CrimsonPhoenix
<Shizuka> 13and volume leveling which is good

<Colt_Silver> Silverscreen: No!
<Shizuka> 13stereo stream?
<Algol> I liked those middle two >.>
<Buytoast> "Pikie climaxed as confetti shot out of her ass, littering the floor like it was some frat house on Initiation Day."
<PillowPoni> MOvie time. And I STILL didn't get my tea
<RAWRity> what's more, the teacher had to watch the whole thing to grade it. And we made sure that every bit of required criteria was there to get a 100. But the jokes? The writing? purposefully awful so as to make her suffer.
<Colt_Silver> Silverscreen: Bad Silverscreen, BAD!
<MrBen> AWRIGHT, LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED!
<JESmith71> Then the TOOT spam happens tomorrow when Crimson's not looking
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Silverscreen do it it would still read it
<OohShiny> *pays attention to the chat* mod talking about his clopfic *O.O*
*Silverscreen catches Colt_Silver's hoof and uses his momentum to throw him into the wall.
<Dusty> oops better not do that again
<Sumica> 00,10we can only stream in stero
<RAWRity> because FUCK her.
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen Interesting idea??? :S
<AJIsAwesome> Be right back, guys. Gotta pack.
<Midnight_Fyre> DSNesmith: Yes, but I always preferrred Tom Sawyer
<Shizuka> 13you can set fmle to use mono

<DSNesmith> I couldn't stand him
<Sumica> 00,10hahah no
<CreativePonyName> what movie is this
<Shizuka> 13was very odd
<HoodyNinja> Silverscreen: Your the writer, do what you want. But I probably wont read it if it's clop
<Silverscreen> 01,11What's this week's B movie?
<CreativePonyName> oh

<Quick_Thinker> STARSHIP TROOPER OH BUCK YEAH

<sentry> kids?
<otakon> fluttercry: reminds me of my "Science and Ethics" elective in HS. Great class, grade was based on book reports though. I just passed it by the bare minimum bc I couldn't find any non-fiction books I wanted to report on with gusto. But my final was "My Utopia" which was very well received, not a SINGLE person asked for explanations of it's workings.
<BatCreditCard> is this the first one?
<Vordox> I'm doing IPOD

<Garettbrony> Dr HOrrible
<DSNesmith> hi frizzy
<Kandarihu> Occupy Wallstreet lost their argument, they concluded that their enemies are too stubborn so they want to do violence too.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I just ask myself "Is it over 65?" If it is, or on it, I'm happy.
<IshKlendathuanPony> Is that a younger Neil Patrick Harris?
<DocSane> otakon: Because they're supposed to have power armor, which were dropped from the movie, and the director didn't understand that soldiers need some sort of air mobile and armor to make up for it.
<DSNesmith> she's my favorite character

<RAWRity> I'm honestly unsure of what I'm going to do after college either. One the one hand, there's some tech companies out here that I could work for, on the other, the law side of Cyber Crime is what really interested in me, and I'm thinking of joining a police force.
<AdamTheDuck> Mooooooo
<RosePetal1> Suddenly blood.

<sentry> too bad this is not irl
<OohShiny> badass sargeant
<Shizuka> 13like most editors it'll take about 1.5x the time of the video you're rendering to render, but much more if it's complex
<fluttercry> 05,15Full Metal Jacket was better
<Reikim> Hello there, Drill Sergeant Nasty.
<JESmith71> I have to do a paper on Mormons and pop culture or in the news. Wonder if I could use that if that was really them
<Midnight_Fyre> http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg688/scaled.php?server=688&filename=nphbuffer1.jpg&res=landing

<Canadian_Brony> I was AFK for a bit. What are we watcing?
<Reikim> Gonna try Movie Maker first.
<AlienWarhead> flutercry definately
<RAWRity> Shizuka: that depends on your comp, too.
<RosePetal1> Every Seargent tries to be like R. Lee Ermy.
<Ghosties> 04I like this guy, though
<Shizuka> 1320 minute intermission took a little over an hour to render out, but that was mostly from the reversed clock in the corner
<Meanwhile> I guess maybe I do. Sir.
<Ghosties> 04He kinda seems like an earlier Tom Hardy
<DSNesmith> asswhuppin' time
<Kandarihu> fluttercry, R. Lee Ermy kinda set the standard for real drill sergeants.
<OohShiny> going to get pwned
<ScarecrowGanjalf> oh my

<Quick_Thinker> what the fuck did we sign ourselvres up for
<Everlasting_Joy> Suddenly, TF2 references. . . In the past.
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm always afraid my computer will melt during rendering
<OohShiny> SHIP!
<MrBen> SON OF A BITCH, SIR

<Bronysith> Gnight my fellow psychopaths and the pyro Shizuka

<Wirisme> Hey Mcfly!
<DocSane> That certainly is Busey...AND HE'S GOT A BOMB!
<pony_300> of course, being willing to wantonly break solider arms would make for a pathetic squad to go against the bugs
<Shizuka> 13the instant the render finishes it'll drop like 20C core temp

<DSNesmith> the motherboard was practically from the PSU to the roof
<pony_300> rifftrax couldn't save it... because it was busy making jokes that 5th graders wouldn't laugh at
<RosePetal1> Suddenly it turned into Star Trek.
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, the movie relied on softsubs. And for some reason, the subs wouldn't work without Rifftrax. So it was Rifftrax both times.
<cowvarkian> ikr Ghosties

<twilight_sprinkle> oh noez
<sentry> titanic
<Reikim> Yeah, I think I've read about those.
<FillyWoona> NOOOOO
<AdamTheDuck> Titanic all over again
<Reikim> Anyway, bad computers.
<AlienWarhead> I'm only here for the buffers now :D
<DSNesmith> it's pretty unbelievable
<Silverscreen> 01,11It's...STYROFOAM!
<RosePetal1> It's a Asteroid!
<Quick_Thinker> fuck da glass
<OohShiny> I'm afraid I can't do that

<Jacke_the_dogpony> PWNED!
<ScarecrowGanjalf> 5!
<HoodyNinja> smash
<Reikim> I used to be running on a computer so old it was incapable of upgrading to Vista.
<Shizuka> 13okay ready, this is my server
<RosePetal1> One and they ded.
<Sumica> 00,10why did they wait to dodge it/
<ScarecrowGanjalf> :D
<Jacke_the_dogpony> Pwny
<DSNesmith> all computers with their OSs on HDDs feel so slow afterwards
<Reikim> Hell, it had issues with XP.
<flutter_spin> fire all... engines?
<fluttercry> 05,15my boot time is seriously like 7 minutes
<Dusty> i had a nightmare where that asteroid came through my tv and blew up the world
<Sumica> 00,10why not just dodge it
<RAWRity> they're expensive, but they hold a LOT more. I've got and external SSD. 1 TB and it's a quarter of the size of my laptop's 350GB HDD
<fluttercry> 05,15I think something is wrong
<CreativePonyName> why the fuck would you count down!?
<Jacke_the_dogpony> WTF 6_9
<OohShiny> boom
<oni_link> oh noooo a slowly spinning asteroid that they could have taken action to avoid 5 minutes prior. Idiots
<RosePetal1> Cuz they had to time it I guess.
<RaveBrony> ded
<cowvarkian> because plot
<flutter_spin> they just lost 10 men
<Dark_Horst> this maneuver makes a whole lot of sense
<FillyWoona> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Reikim> I ran on Win 2k right through 7's launch.
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica this is the future!
<RosePetal1> Now they are ded.
<Jacke_the_dogpony> OWNED
<Vordox> LOST 250 PEOPLE
<HoodyNinja> Sumica: movie stuffs
<Vordox> Meh
<DSNesmith> how old is the install, fluttercry?
<Tovler> funny how they couldn't see that with 100 quintillion mile visibility.
<MrBen> And there goes the captain, eh? xD
<sentry> people died
<DSNesmith> windows just gets slow after a while
<Silverscreen> 01,11What did they lose?
<RaveBrony> They are so screwed
<fluttercry> 05,15ehh 3 years

<DSNesmith> it accumulates shit
<AlienWarhead> lost the bridge
<Vordox> WHO BUILT THIS SHIP!?
<Deadlypon3> No biggie, Just lost the ENTIRE COMMAND BRIDGE
<Shizuka> 13haruko is a pentium 4 2.6GHz... with 256MB ram and 80GB HDD

<DSNesmith> clean out some dead reg entries
<Sumica> 00,10because she made the flight path better she killed them
<RAWRity> Shizuka: ...god lord.
<sentry> captain is dead
<Jacke_the_dogpony> Nicke123 Outslan24 Trolling Hostia alpha Die
<LunarRepublicGuard> wat of the odds?
<HoodyNinja> Sumica: Dont let women drive
<RosePetal1> Dam it! Now I wont' know what happens next in Star Trek!
<DSNesmith> if you really want to speed it back up, back your data up and reformat
<PwnySwag> LAME
<flutter_spin> not her again
<Deadlypon3> Durrrrh
<Algol> I KNOW THAT FEEL Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13she baaaarely gets by running apache and irssi
<Reikim> 256 MB RAM.
<Crippler> she's got a big head
<PwnySwag> SLUT
<Vordox> really....
<twilight_sprinkle> they have some really crappy sensors if they couldnt see the thing any further away
<Vordox> REALLY?!
<Algol> I KNOW IT SO WELL
<Dark_Horst> and why yes, we do have emergency evade buttons with glass covering that happen to have the exact right course hardwired on them for just this rock
<Quick_Thinker> another asteroid in 5 sec
<DSNesmith> also wow
<Dark_Horst> why you ask?
<MrBen> lol
<Troy> when are the ponys?
<DSNesmith> 80GB hard drive
<RaveBrony> =_(\
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps there is a reason we dont fly right at the enemy
<Quick_Thinker> and it kills them this time
<Canadian_Brony> wait . . . that turned positive?
<oni_link> theyre sappin mah sentry
<Shizuka> 13but she's headless debian so that eliminates a lot of bloat
<Deadlypon3> COngrats, we just lost only HALF of our command team on this flight
<Vordox> ARGH this WEAK plot is puncturing my BRAIN!
<Shizuka> 13the hard drive is stolen from my box two desktops ago
<DSNesmith> I have an old Dell downstairs
<Shizuka> 13i think it was a 40GB in there before
<DSNesmith> and I do mean old
<DSNesmith> like
<AlienWarhead> Vordox we need a stronger plot
<DSNesmith> I couldn't figure out how to get the case off
<otakon> it's a satire action movie
<otakon> that is the point
<RosePetal1> Where is Neil Patrick Harris? I demand to see more of him in this movie.
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: weak plot? it'S about war against monster bugs
<Shizuka> 13anyway she's an HP i acquired from a nonprofit i volunteered at

<DSNesmith> they're really nice people
<oni_link> MrBen: dont.
<Sumica> 00,10I do like the look of the tech in this movie
<Quick_Thinker> reminds me of the Quake 4 intro
<Reikim> Screw them and their shiny, "user-friendly" aesthetic.
<cowvarkian> YAY genocide

<MrBen> oni_link: Wasn't considering it.
<OohShiny> they gonna kill ponies? noooo
<Tovler> 2 LEGS GOOD. 4 LEGS BAD
<Dr_Fumbles> No Shephard? No Masterchief? No Chuck Norris? ... they're fucke
<RosePetal1> Basically kill everything and everyone.
<fluttercry> 05,15Most valuable company ever
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: very classic, isnt it?
<otakon> Sumica: too bad no power armor
<Algol> the tech look is reminding me of Halo
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Macs only play pyro cause m1 + w works
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: sucks
<Everlasting_Joy> Tovler: I got that.
<Deadlypon3> Tovler ANIMAL FARM REF FOR WINS
<Algol> and Aliens
<Canadian_Brony> shit guys, we're all fcked now
<Fou_Lou> Silverscreen: whats the difference? In our world just a human does it and it takes a buit longer
<Dusty> the tech in this movie sucks, their body armor doesn't do shit
<AdamTheDuck> Tovler, dat Animal Farm referance
<otakon> Algol: yfw this came out before Halo
<Jacke_the_dogpony> Aliens
<RosePetal1> No Jackie Chan either. They are doomed.
<thelonepony> ODST
<Sumica> 00,10I might have to show some roughneck cronocals
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: i was out before i could reap the benefits. it sucks
<Dusty> they might as well be wearing paper
<DSNesmith> they have 2 macbooks, at least 3 macs, two apple TV things, tons of ipods
<otakon> Algol: THIS inspired Halo's look I think
<Shizuka> 13apparently someone at daycare is an apple fan... because every time emma sees my kindle she goes "CAN I HAVE YOUR IPAD"
<sentry> I think bungie was inspired from this movie
<Algol> nope
<DSNesmith> god knows how many ipads
<pony_300> if (Legs > 2) {Kill em DED}
<IshKlendathuanPony> how much longer is this film?
<otakon> Sumica: sounds good, decent show
<oni_link> so I have to get an MRI all on my own
<Algol> Aliens inspired Halo

<Quick_Thinker> LETS GO AND KICK THIER ARACNID ASSES BACK TO TARTARUS ARE YOU WITH PARINES?
<PwnySwag> THEY GOT RAMBO, THEYRE FINE;)
<AlienWarhead> Those box flyers look weird
<Reikim> I mean, I understand why some people use Apple products.
<DSNesmith> I haven't the heart to tell them they've wasted so much money
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: was a serious injury?
<fluttercry> 05,15What if I told you it was possible to play pyro without using only m1+W?
<Jacke_the_dogpony> >_>
<AlienWarhead> yay warfare
<Dark_Horst> bugs. they POOP AT YOU! FROM A PLANETS SURFACE
<Quick_Thinker> mortors?
<Dr_Fumbles> wraiths?
<DSNesmith> also whenever it gets mentioned they go into drone mode
<RosePetal1> Numba Two.
<Tovler> 35% is a recurring theme
<DashWithRainbows> fluttercry Impossible.
<DSNesmith> and start advertising it to me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fluttercry we know we play with Shizuka
<RAWRity> really, Apple has some good software. The Mac OS is very well contrsucted, UNIX based, stable and slick. But damn if they don't do everything in their power to make it not worth it, be it the price the shitty GUI the pissball hardware and design, and their AWFUL liscening policies.
<Canadian_Brony> what's wth the random flying balls of . . . stuff?
<Dusty> FouLou: very true
<p4ngya> *killem ded;
<Shizuka> 13the only thing i'll give apple credit for is being loosely based on unix, and so exposing a more useful command terminal than windows does
<RosePetal1> Bumpy ride.
<Quick_Thinker> WHY IS NO ONE WITH ME
<Sumica> 00,10they did finaly add the power armor in the third movie
<Dusty> NOT true

<Tovler> They'd better be careful Mutalisks can fly in space.
<DSNesmith> "how bout you lieutenant? ever been on a drop before?"
<Dusty> you are never prepared for war
<Quick_Thinker> ah fuck
<Algol> it's better for prgramming =_=
<Jacke_the_dogpony> Aliens are n00bs.. can't hit one ship
<Meanwhile> Sad thing is you /can/ play pyro doing nothing but m1+w
<Shizuka> 13because cmd.exe needs to DIE...
<RosePetal1> Pedro what are you doing?
<Dark_Horst> latin boy loves the ride
<CreativePonyName> REMEMBER Y0UR TRAINING what capture the flag?
<DSNesmith> "Thirty-two... simulated"
<otakon> THAT IS COMPLETELY USELESS AGAINST "BUGS"
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: yeah. but im walking now. I still have to check to see what can be done to get my mobility back to 100%.
<Dusty> that's bug shit guys
<RosePetal1> There's a mistake.

<Jacke_the_dogpony> Faqin aliens as begun to pros
<sentry> ships are getting destroyed
<Reikim> But Shizuka, that would require Microsoft to actually give two fucks.
<Dken2021> only thing I like about apple is the sleak tech they made

<RosePetal1> SPIDDDERRRRSSSS.
<RAWRity> A note to anybody who wants to make money: before the launch of Win8, buy as many versions of Win 7 as you can for when your less techsavvy friends shit themselves.
<Shizuka> 13vista's problem was the driver overhaul

<RosePetal1> NOOOO PEDRO !
<Fenr> (to be honest...a bit more powerful than a 40k space marine..THEY CARRY FRIGGIN NUKES AS PERSONAL WEAPONS)
<RaveBrony> So ded
<Silverscreen> 01,11Random question: Why aren't they using the lazers from Training?
<OohShiny> that gotta hurt
<DSNesmith> you can get a system builder version for only 100 bucks

<OohShiny> well, I'm not getting any sleep tonight for sure
<Sumica> 00,10not cool Jacke_the_dogpony
<DSNesmith> it just got so much bad press that no one uses it
<ScarecrowGanjalf> This movie has the best buffers:D
<RAWRity> Reikim: that is the horror of the "modern" interface.
<RosePetal1> He ded.
<Reikim> Nope, sorry 8, cannot take you seriously anymore.

<MrBen> And another one bites the dust.
<RosePetal1> Or not.
<Dusty> NOW
<DSNesmith> 8 is a turd though
<Canadian_Brony> reverse-mine?
<Dark_Horst> otakon: actually, they're quite effective. barney stinson proved it. also quite usefull in the game
<thelonepony> ded
<Wirisme> every buffer is the stream saying "fuck this shit"
<Dusty> NOW
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> cdead
<OohShiny> ded
<PwnySwag> LOL
<Dusty> NOW
<OohShiny> RAPE
<magmablock> I've noticed that pretty much no movies accurately display patients going into shock. if your leg gets cut off, you would probably react as if you just got a bee sting or something
<LunarRepublicGuard> MrBen: 13 buffers?
<RosePetal1> Busey is ded.
<Rosfox> ded
<DSNesmith> because its problem is way more than internal
<Dusty> dammit
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> THOSE bugs aagonne rape them so hard
<DSNesmith> the UI is utter shit
<Quick_Thinker> man humans are lossing BADLY
<Reikim> Microsoft, stop trying to be Apple, and do shit.
<Dusty> buffer there would of been perfect
<DSNesmith> and that's not something that they'll fix
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen (Insert Adult noise from the Snoopy cartoons) Oh, did they forgot to include them? ok
<MrBen> LunarRepublicGuard: As many as I counted from my end.
<Tovler> The black guy always dies 14th.
<OohShiny> RETREAT!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> and IM SO DRUNK
<ScarecrowGanjalf> RUN AWAAAY!
<DashWithRainbows> Don't think to use flame based weapons?
<otakon> Dark_Horst: yeah against one immobile(basically) bug, NOT hundreds at a time.
<MrBen> LunarRepublicGuard: Did I miss one?
<Crippler> well...that didn't work
<twilight_sprinkle> well that didnt last long
<Marky> great success
<Reikim> Don't try to replicate Apple's shiny modern interface, because it sucks.
<sentry> humans needs to have heavy viechals
<RosePetal1> Gee, it probably was a bad idea to attack without thinking.
<pony_300> they should've loaded up with alot more nukes.
<Shizuka> 13the only reason i bought asuka was for the massive ram and hard drive upgrade (plus geforce 8300 is a terrible GPU)... otherwise i would have happily continued with vista on kimiko
<RAWRity> Win8 is Microsoft trying to make a platform taht's the same on desktop, smartphone, and tablet. And it's a horrible idea.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> BUG
<DSNesmith> yeah everyone's trying to be apple these days
<otakon> dat propaganda
<OohShiny> die

<otakon> that doesn't protect against bug bits
<RosePetal1> WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL FILMING IT?!
<Kurra> You know, I could watch a Red Cross blood drive in my neighborhood and get the same visual effect XD
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen the writers* forgot to include them
<CreativePonyName> lol eic cameraman
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> IN TWO
<Shizuka> 13someone at microsoft came in drunk that day
<Silverscreen> 01,11Cameraman's Job: Just film, don't act.
<magmablock> And almost none of them are firing whilst retreating... why?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: ...NO.
<RAWRity> NO
<Tovler> Poor Hank. Well, he'll recover from his injuries next season.
<Fenr> and the book makes a point in having the first attack of the hundreds of space marine go...AS BAD as the one in the film
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/lzVWP.jpg
<Reikim> If they fail to fix the interface in successive versions of Windows, I will break down and get Linux.
<Ghosties> 04How awesome it would be if the cameraman survived
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Silverscreen: dying an option?
<RosePetal1> Ded.
<Ghosties> 04Like the whole movie
<DSNesmith> I don't know if I'll go that far
<RAWRity> in the immortal words of Sam Witwicky: NONONONONONONONONONO
<Shizuka> 13unless you have one of those mice with left and right scroll built into the wheel.. and even then it's abysmal
<MrBen> RUN AWAY! RUN AWAAAAY!
<Crippler> LOL
<DSNesmith> I might just stick with 7
<sentry> It times like this that you really need a tank
<OohShiny> ew

<RosePetal1> Now he ded.
<Ghosties> 04He'd probably end up being my favorite character...but oh well. Camerman died
<magmablock> Dumbass camera man

<Quick_Thinker> TONS OF BULLETSSSSSSSSSSSS

<Canadian_Brony> Sumica . . . I have nothing to say about that.
<OohShiny> OohShiny: Protagonist protection?
<Everlasting_Joy> You want the joj?

<Reikim> I enjoyed what little programming I did.
<Flootahshy> Moopy: How so?
<Algol> and I didn't know, and went for the CS route

<Kandarihu> It would be a REAL twist to have a story involve the protagonist dying near the end of the movie, and his friends win the final victory.

<DSNesmith> I like how none of us are paying attention to the movie
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I wasn't expecting it out of this movie.
<LunarRepublicGuard> WHY did they not do this in the beginning?
<Fenr> because bombing them is useless
<otakon> Ghosties: bc the Federation are idiots
<Algol> I am
<Meanwhile> Ghosties: They assumed the bugs were stupid last time.
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: The plot demanded it?
<ScarecrowGanjalf> umm why they didn't do that at the beginning?
<Dark92Enigma> Ghosties: SAME HERE!
<Fenr> they live underground XD

<otakon> ugh
<pony_9475> lol at that huge flashlight on the gun
<Shizuka> 13but yeah, my last link there, it's amazing
<DSNesmith> those are painfully stupid
<ScarecrowGanjalf> oh yeah, napalm is more expensive than people
<Quick_Thinker> how is this possible
<Kandarihu> It's about dinnertime for me. How close are we to the end of the movie?
<Dark_Horst> Quick_Thinker: learning through pain principle
<OohShiny> they used laser guns when training
<Reikim> Oh yeah
<Samsa> lol huge flashliught
<Tovler> Humbugs are my favorite bugs. So sweet and tasty.
<Algol> I've seen this one a couple times, so I'm not missing much
<RosePetal1> Wait now the gun is working? What?
<Flootahshy> Kandarihu: Far.
<Canadian_Brony> Kandarihu nowhere
<Reikim> I tried to do that Shizu, I really did.
<OohShiny> why don't they use laser guns?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Overkill Much?
<Dark92Enigma> Ghosties: (Insert adult gibberish sound from the Charlie Brown cartoons) OH the writers thought about that NOW
<Quick_Thinker> first fight they sucked and this time they kick ass
<Reikim> But no tiiiiiime

<RosePetal1> That slime is delicious.
<AdamTheDuck> There's no kill quite like overkill
<Reikim> I might retry but no tiiiiiiiime

<LunarRepublicGuard> mini nuke
<Quick_Thinker> so in this world you can die and come back just like that
<DSNesmith> from that distance
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: bc it doesn't kill instantly but that is better

<RAWRity> Of all the hearts I knew, her's was the most...human
<ScarecrowGanjalf> ohai Neil
<RosePetal1> Neil finally shows up.
<DSNesmith> because every single one has different notation
<pony_300> Quick Thinker: the most I've heard about it is cloning sheep; be best to look it up though, we're just here for movies and ponies.
<pony_9475> in 10 min, the end up running into the floating casket, causing everyone in the fleet to die
<pony_9475> the end
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> NPH FTW l
<sentry> bugs outsmart humans
<AJIsAwesome> DAHAHAHAHAHA He said "P"! :P

<OohShiny> he's already a coronel?
<Ghosties> 04But I already P'd
<DSNesmith> to capture that BRAIN
<Kurra> Haha, he said pee..
<OohShiny> what the fuck
<Ghosties> 04Like five minutes ago
<IshKlendathuanPony> Any much longer?
<DSNesmith> and people say this isn't a B movie
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica . . . :D
<Wirisme> Maybe if you SHOOT at them some more!
<DocSane> We dress like Nazis, so Paul Verhooven is saying that they're Nazis.
<DSNesmith> it's about 15 minutes maybe
<Algol> like, 20 minutes, IshKlendathuanPony
<pony_300> he learned alot from obi wan
<Dark_Horst> and yes, the guy who made this movie stated that he looked into nazi uniforms to design these guys' costumes. especially the psi corps, seeing how their uniforms resemble the waffen-ss
<fluttercry> 05,15Wait...just finished high school
<CreativePonyName> another rank jesus
<RosePetal1> NO.
<PwnySwag> lol nazis
<OohShiny> Neil is insta-coronel
<Midnight_Fyre> Made colonel in about a year?
<DSNesmith> yeah, long-ass movie
<fluttercry> 05,15is now a Colonel
<Yahooz> and then they fucked
<DSNesmith> and yeah, have you seen the promotion rate?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Yahooz: no
<Everlasting_Joy> This movie is long.
<DSNesmith> the only qualification is surviving your superiors
<sentry> bunch of nazis
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry . . . wha . . .
<Silverscreen> 01,11Or, you know, you use the massive ships you have to just NUKE THE FUCKERS TO HELL!
<Sumica> 00,10is that woman wearing a girdle?
<AlienWarhead> deck?
<Reikim2> It's like Klingons.
<PwnySwag> NAZIS!!!!
<OohShiny> fluttercry: remember, he was a doctor with 16 years
<RosePetal1> Then he forgot about Ditzy and had sex with the slut in the end. I'm calling it.
<IshKlendathuanPony> The Longest Movie in the World foar A movie
<mitamaking> He just moves up the ranks so well, he is future leader
<RAWRity> Mobile Infantry = Canon Fodder
<Spitfire> YAY young guile still lives
<MrBen> Silverscreen: Amen, brother!
<DSNesmith> except less self-destruction, more stupidity
<DocSane> The problem is that Heinlein wasn't writing a book about Fascism.
<Fenr> There s a reason they don't nuke fromorbit
<Reikim> More or less, yeah.
<otakon> kids
<fluttercry> 05,15This honestly is the worst military ever
<otakon> funny
<DSNesmith> now see in the book, the mobile infantry were more like armor
<Algol> also, fairly certain that NPH's jacket is supposed to be kinda SS inspired
<Canadian_Brony> Silverscreen that would require intelligence, tho
<Fenr> Obviously,the movie skips it
<fluttercry> 05,15Where's the tanks? Where's the air support?
<otakon> GOddamn they ARE kids
<DSNesmith> they dont' need that
<sentry> kids?
<MrBen> "We're the old men." >Is only 20 years old.
<mitamaking> That is a kid
<Dark92Enigma> DID he say MEMES?
<DSNesmith> they have human spirit
<Sumica> 00,10kiss ass much suger?
<Reikim> So this is the guy from the beginning of the movie, right?
<DSNesmith> and courage
<Phase4> 00,02i'm confused
<oni_link> fluttercry: he would barely be a fuzzy if he were in the army :D
<RosePetal1> Rednecks?
<RAWRity> the army's approach is basically "Throw as many people as possible at the bugs until they choke on our soldiers' guts."
<DSNesmith> and chins
<Phase4> 00,02how many planets do the bugs have?
<Dark92Enigma> WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE
<Reikim> He's an officer now?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Plasma
<Midnight_Fyre> Doesn't quite have the same flare of Michael Ironside
<sentry> letting kids fight in wars?
<otakon> Phase4: several
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ASS BLASTERS!@!!!
<Canadian_Brony> those kids in the front look younger than me
<Dusty> Bye everypony going to sleep I have ACT tomorrow morning wish me luck:)
<RosePetal1> Well they are here let's go!
<DocSane> Farting plasma again.
<Algol> because he's not Sam Fisher
<Kurra> Dusty good luck :>
<DSNesmith> people in main chat taking this seriously
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: a bunch. movie doesnt say
<MrBen> "I suppose it's right over there!"
<Phase4> 00,02otakon, so they have achived space travel?
<DSNesmith> sigh
<otakon> night Dusty good luck
<Everlasting_Joy> Night Dusty and good luck!
<DocSane> Dusty: Good luck.
<oni_link> Dusty: goodluck
<mitamaking> Dusty: good luck
<Kurra> POOT POOT POOT POOT POOT
<Algol> pre-Blackwatch Sam anyways...
<Quick_Thinker> ... nice dodge
<pony_300> Silverscreen: And considering how gungho and mock conseervative this movie is, it's hard to believe that they don't have afew thousand of those radioactive megaton nukes lying around.
<RosePetal1> Don't get too close to the misslies you idiots!
<Dusty> Thank you :)
<MrBen> Good luck, Dusty! Sleep well!
<AdamTheDuck> I thought it was just one planet o.o
<AJIsAwesome> Dusty: Bye! GOod Luck! :)
<otakon> Phase4: technically, they actually just cast their spores into space
<Sumica> 00,10they realy need to stop parking the fleet so close together and right on top of the planet.
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Dusty
<Meanwhile> Mane chat is where you go when you're a dingbat.
<ScarecrowGanjalf> If those guys were Nazis, then they are Hitlerjugend:P
<DocSane> Maybe if the ships weren't spaced only 20m apart...
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: maybe they just evolved similarly
<otakon> Okay these pilots are idiots
<AlienWarhead> Maybe they should spead out a bit
<Phase4> 00,02otakon, o_O
<RAWRity> >evasive action
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they are capable of shootingn us down lets us stand in their range
<otakon> First time: DIDN'T SEE IT COMING
*Kurra pulls out his little party favor thingy POOTPOOTPOOTPOOT
<Reikim> Or you feel like making fun of dingbats.
<MrBen> How much longer are we in this movie for anyway, just out of curiosity?
<RAWRity> >in that tugboat of a spaceship? good luck.
<fluttercry> 05,15oh you mean turn right?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> otakon: ikr? and im drunk

<otakon> idiots
<PwnySwag> LOL
<Rosfox> Now are they ded?

<Meanwhile> Those ships have real issues with maneuvers.
<AdamTheDuck> ded*
<RosePetal1> They are ded.
<OohShiny> Titanic reference?
<Tovler1> I guess they had to force an ending to this movie somehow.
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: Military Intelligence is an oxymoron.
<Quick_Thinker> now i feel bad laughing
<DSNesmith> it's called explosive decompression
<MrBen> WELP, THEY'RE GONERS.
<DSNesmith> when the hull is breached
<oni_link> man, even after OCS, youre barely a lieutenant. This kid got out of high school and got a rank that a SENIOR OFFICER would normally have.
<PwnySwag> SLUT IS DED LOL
<Dr_Fumbles> end
<OohShiny> I have a Titanic feeling now
<Reikim> They have shields.
<otakon> incomin grisly scene
<Reikim> Of some kind.
<RAWRity> Reikim: bugs are firing plasma at the ships.
<Yahooz> i can almost smell the stupidity
<Meanwhile> The infantry have gone in to find the brain bug and the fleet is standing by.
<thelonepony> space is a bitch
<MrBen> Like they wasn't the first time.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim ships in orbits are being shoot down by plasma
<DSNesmith> the atmospheric pressure sends objects flying out
<RosePetal1> Setzer!
<Reikim> Cool
<Tovler1> aaaaaaand BUFFER
<Quick_Thinker> OH COME ON JUST DIE
<Canadian_Brony> otakon dat true man

<Spitfire> issac death
<Meanwhile> Death by door.
<Vordox> SAFETY SYSTEM KILL!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dead
<OohShiny> no shit?
<thelonepony> finally!!!
<pony_300> come to think of it, these bugs are able to fire bursts of plasmahuge enough to cut through their starships... eventhough their shots don't look anywhere near escape velocity
<otakon> and dead from shock
<OohShiny> no shit
<Vordox> So much for safety
<sentry> lol already dead?
<Wirisme> awesome design there
<MrBen> Aaaand there goes the captain.
<Meanwhile> Not very heroic.

<Ghosties> 04MY PARENTS ARE DEADE
<Ghosties> 04*DEAD
<Slained_by_pony> Its a...
<RAWRity> Doors! My one weakness!
<Reikim> Also gruesome.
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S A TRAP
<OohShiny> RosePetal1: Where does that quote come from anyway?
<Slained_by_pony> :P
<Quick_Thinker> reminds of the halo marine
<ScarecrowGanjalf> Abandon ship or abandon all hope!
<mitamaking> stupid safety doors
<RosePetal1> Star Trek I think.
<OohShiny> Titanic...
<DSNesmith> yeah nothing in this is heroic
<Quick_Thinker> BIENG LIKE DIVE AND THEN oh noooo
<RAWRity> but yeah, this is actually a really entertaining movie
<Reikim> Sooo, I'm guessing this military never developed orbit-to-surface weapons?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> mitamaking: taking more lives than saving
<DSNesmith> especially the parts with heroic music
<Slained_by_pony> Abandon ship or YOU WIL DIE!
<Dark92Enigma> ABANDON SHIP! FILLIES AND MARES FIRST!!!!!!
<otakon> pony_300: maybe the fact it's PLASMA and it's massive is enough? or the upper atmosphere and gravity of the Klandathu planets is different enough to allow it?
<RosePetal1> Ship blew up ded.
<AlienWarhead> OohShiny Star Trek the original series
<Midnight_Fyre> RAWRity: very
<Canadian_Brony> Equip helmet!
<MrBen> What is it with being in charge and dying, unless you're a main character?
<Quick_Thinker> fuck im a colt
<RosePetal1> ded.
<Algol> iirc, the whole point of the movie was to parody the book
<Silverscreen> 01,11Goddamn, just kill the betraying bitch already.
<Meanwhile> Reikim: They want the brain bug from the planet, tactically they can't afford to lose the chance.
<OohShiny> AlienWarhead: Thanks
<Quick_Thinker> looks like i die
<DocSane> Stupid escape pod system.
<RAWRity> Reikim: or rather, they never needed to because it's much cheaper to just throw soldiers at the things.
<MrBen> Wait, I just answered my own question.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Dark92Enigma: screw that
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim they did for but they don't want to nuke the planet to find the brain bug
<Slained_by_pony> 232302323 peoples Was slained by bugs
<DSNesmith> best part is, algol, they didn't tell that to anyone
<Sumica> 00,10they realy did not plan on many people makeing it to the life boats
<Kurra> that is worst lifeboat.
<Canadian_Brony> MrBen this is a B-movie
<Algol> yep
<DSNesmith> so people came expecting a straight adaptation
<Sumica> 00,10they only are 2 seaters
<Reikim> Why do they want the brain bug?
<RosePetal1> They won't I can tell. :|
<OohShiny> And... they... die
<Quick_Thinker> bodies
<Midnight_Fyre> Algol: Was the book really serious?
<DSNesmith> for science
<Dark_Horst> bonk
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim know your enemy thingy
<Quick_Thinker> damn
<Algol> yes
<RosePetal1> Everyone is ded!
<Meanwhile> Because up till now the bugs have never shown intelligence.
<DSNesmith> well the book was less over-the-top than this
<Slained_by_pony> Ship was slained by bug 23232
<DSNesmith> the stupidity is vastly played up in the movie
<Midnight_Fyre> Algol: Was the book any good?
<Canadian_Brony> "Piece of cake!" inb4 crash landing
<Rosfox> this movie is longggg
<Algol> I have no idea
<Reikim> And it's totally worth sacrificing all your troops.
<Ghosties> 04Piece of cake? Battlefield Leverage?
<Algol> I haven't read it
<MrBen> Canadian_Brony: I just realized I answered my own question while I mentioned these guys were main characters. Main characters aren't allowed to die more often than that.
<DSNesmith> the book is Heinlein
<Quick_Thinker> whoopie deee
<fluttercry> 05,15I just remember being 6 and seeing this thinking it was the greatest movie in history
<RosePetal1> Johhnny I love you.

<DSNesmith> and all that applies
<MrBen> *more often than not.
<RAWRity> Reikim: the military doesn't care. They've got plenty of soldiers waiting to die.
<Midnight_Fyre> Algol: Ah, I thought you were speaking from experience. Nevermind
<DSNesmith> it's old school scifi
<Sumica> 00,10that ship was your way off the planet

<oni_link> Silverscreen: court-martial her :D
<RosePetal1> CarMENL.
<pony_300> otakon: I doubt it, the soliders don't seem any lighter. Still those plasma shots didn't look that huge when we saw the bugs firing them. Now these shots are suddenly comparable to the size of their starships
<OohShiny> weee, meteor
<MrBen> "Our ride's been blown to smithereens. We're on our own."
<Reikim> Starship Troopers...I thought that was supposed to be a semi-decent book.
<Dark92Enigma> CAAAAAAAAAAARMEEEEEEEEEN

<DSNesmith> now even watching clips of it makes me cringe
<MrBen> Dark_Horst: Wait, there were sequels to this?
<DocSane> Knife will help.
<RosePetal1> We know that the boyfriend will be ded.
<Algol> YEP
<Slained_by_pony> Don't drink and drive a ship
<Canadian_Brony> inb4 the knife is useful
<Dark_Horst> well, at least it as a nice survival package
<Tovler1> it took me this long to realize Johnny Rico is his full name.
<RAWRity> talk about hindsight
<fluttercry> 05,15Then you grew up and were like "Oh God why"
<Algol> I still like Batman Forever
<otakon> pony_300: we didn't see a side by side comparison between the bug blasters and humans, the blasters are bigger then Tankers by far
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: theres a 4?!
<Midnight_Fyre> Algol: As a kid I didn't think Batman and Robin was excellent, but I did like it and watch it a lot
<OohShiny> situation is FUCKED UP

<Slained_by_pony> Oggy and the cockroaches
<Meanwhile> What've you got against roaches.
<Spectrum_Rush> did anyone notice that the standard bugs look like the arachnid enemy from tales of series?
<DocSane> In the book, the bugs used technology. They had guns and stuff, too.
<Phase4> 00,02whats this movie called?
<Sumica> 00,10and 4th Corrupt
<Fluffle> they are bigger at my house

<MrBen> Yahooz: Yeah. xD
<Marky> 19buffers/10
<Canadian_Brony> SCREENCAP/10
<DashWithRainbows> I only like this movie because it had the actor who played General Granger.
<oni_link> hi SuperBrony64 :P
<DSNesmith> is that it's not an allegory
<Dr_Fumbles> 7/7 asses
<DSNesmith> it has applicability
<magmablock> One thing I think we can all agree on is that the theme song is fucking awesome
<Reikim> Um
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Kinixys and SuperBrony64
<Meanwhile> Oh thank god. Now I can close photoshop.
<DashWithRainbows> This is the only reason.
<Sumica> 00,10this has a rifftrax?
<Dken2021> oh, movie over already?

<twilight_sprinkle> this movie was designed for buffer
<Kurra> Oh lawl: BUFFER KNIFE - HOT KNIFE THROUGH BUFFER
<oni_link> Dr_Fumbles: oh you :3
<thelonepony> hi SuperBrony64
<Reikim> There was a Starship Troopers anime.
<XylemTube> Next Lotery, im gonna vote for idiocracy
<Phase4> 00,02it should have a rifftrax
<DSNesmith> yeah
<AJIsAwesome> Dr_Fumbles: This game is the boopenest! :P

<DSNesmith> that one actually did have power armor
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile plz pros use paint

<mitamaking> Rue McCalahan?
<RosePetal1> Cut off the movie/10
<Kinixys> I second Idiocracy!
<fluttercry> 05,15AJIsAwesome this was the coopenist movie
<Rustymeat> BLOOP
<DocSane> I should put in the 2010 Space Battleship Yamato movie
<otakon> also, it was done by the people who did the new Appleseed
<Meanwhile> For crying out loud, the entire LotR trilogy didn't get that many.
<RAWRity> like, just have it be that the Brain Bug is full of oil, and you've got your Iraq war allegory all laid out for you.
<otakon> the CG anime
<im_a_dolphin> ITS PONY TIME..... Finn : okay
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: :D
<ScarecrowGanjalf> i.imgur.com/WpdQp.png i.imgur.com/FJHbB.png i.imgur.com/0gWzp.png i.imgur.com/XJnvT.png - some clean screencaps if anyone would like
<MrBen> Well this was....better than I originally expected.
<DSNesmith> rawrity that would cheapen the film
<OohShiny> well, I can bare some gore, as I saw in this movie...
<oni_link> We need more people for Mann UP, Im using a surplus ticket too. Who wants in?
<OohShiny> not too much, though
<otakon> Meanwhile: I saved most of them myself
<DSNesmith> it's not supposed to be a direct parallel to any situation
<magmablock> This would make a great L4D soundmod for when your running to the escape boat/truck/whatever
<mitamaking> ScarecrowGanjalf: Was teh Neil buffer real?
<DSNesmith> it's a poke at warmongering in general
<im_a_dolphin> Roll rolll barrel roll (8)
<RosePetal1> Yes.
<OohShiny> mitamaking: yes
<AlienWarhead> BronyState making memes every Friday and Saturday
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol fluttercry and AJIsAwesome have you guys been watchin Game Grumps? :D
<Sumica> 00,10alright Meanwhile, show me what you got.
<mitamaking> wow
<fluttercry> 05,15Sketch_Toku_Brony you know it
<RAWRity> Funfact: There's a Mass Effect anime film.
<Klumzeedragon> And I missed the movie. :P Laaaame.
<RAWRity> due out november.
<Dr_Fumbles> Sir, I don't think we're getting out of this cave...
<ScarecrowGanjalf> mitamaking: eeyup
<RAWRity> and it looks like ass.
<Reikim> Really?
<DSNesmith> you could show it in north korea and it would have the same applicability
<Reikim> Damn.
<DSNesmith> well
<Silverscreen> 01,11Eh, I only give it a 6/10. It establishes good characters, but it's just another war movie set in space instead of earth. You're kinda left empty on a few things as well, which isn't a good thing. So it's not a great movie, just mindless entertainment.
<RosePetal1> Love the buffer shots.
<DSNesmith> no
<Dr_Fumbles> I'M ENDIN IT!
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Yep. :D
<OohShiny> I see ponies
<DSNesmith> you couldn't show it in north korea
<Algol> btw, brief sidenote
<Meanwhile> Sumica: There's 16, I cba to go through the list right now. Take the most recent and deal with it. http://i.imgur.com/JwwqF.jpg
<OohShiny> now I can see them
<RosePetal1> That's true.

<fluttercry> 05,15I made this one http://i.imgur.com/gWhrR.jpg and this one http://i.imgur.com/SlFG1.jpg
<Kinixys> What did I miss?
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: i thought it was just a parody
<otakon> Silverscreen: seriously what the FUCK do the bugs eat?
<Vordox> Silverscreen: But if you DO have a brain? XD
<fluttercry> 05,15they aren't very good
<Reikim> A Mass Effect anime film...it would work, but I doubt they'll pull it off.
<DSNesmith> berrypunch you shut your goddamn mouth
<Sumica> 00,10PM then Meanwhile
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: man we need Game Grumps streamed :D
<mitamaking> Silverscreen: The weird thing about this movie is that is a good allagory of the Iraq and Afgan wars
<Buytoast> no
<Algol> who left the cider out?
<RosePetal1> lol buffer.
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Yeah. :D

<Moopy> Duke: what kind of shit ending is that? i aint dead im coming back for more
<Silverscreen> 01,11Dunno who made it, but I like this one: http://i.imgur.com/jv9MY.jpg
<otakon> Buytoast: the hell you say, they're hilarious
<Meanwhile> Bah.
<magmablock> 8/10 Just mindless action with little substance, but that's all you should be looking for in a movie like this.
<AJIsAwesome> HE JUST SHOWS UP! When did I ever tell you to listen to him? :D
<Yahooz> Sumica: http://i.imgur.com/sUSv8.jpg
<Applechip> did anyone screencap that probe buffer shot?
<DSNesmith> oho foley was used in this
<DSNesmith> wonder what for
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity like any movie from a video game it will suck
<DSNesmith> probably bug noises
<Buytoast> i suppose if you have the mind of a 7 year old then they might be slightly funny
<oni_link> Silverscreen: dat head on reference :D
<RosePetal1> Yes.
<Kinixys> This was Starship Troopers wasn't it?
<MrBen> Well, I think I'm gonna head on off.

<Reikim> Anyone seen that?
<otakon> not one of the best movies ever
<DocSane> mitamaking: The war lasts three missions which end up taking about 1200 years.
<DSNesmith> ummmmmm
<Yahooz> Sumica: Im just that good arent I?
<otakon> but it was one of the better video game movies

<oni_link> Kurra: yeah im _oni_link_ on steam so add me and I can invite you
*Kurra flailwaves at oni_link, he's good at suppression fire!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Fall wather friends
<Dark92Enigma> Here are my thoughts on this movie..........the problem with it wasn't the characters........for the most part. But the inconsistency, followed by it's corniness filled with it's cliches it's only leveled by the FX.----------other than that, it was just a propaganda for the army, with cliche characters included........other than that, it was good mindless entertainment, and a good pick 6.5/10
<DSNesmith> BERRY PUNCH
<JESmith71> Fall Weather Friends
<Reikim> There's a Halo OVA.
<mitamaking> Silverscreen: Running of the leaves one
<fluttercry> 05,15Buttman, I'm hard pressed to ask...but what is your technique?
<Buytoast> probably another small horse episode
<Phase4> 00,02i think halo could make a good movie

<Algol> Karen Traviss' stuff....
<AJIsAwesome> Yep
<Canadian_Brony> Buytoast eeyup
<Algol> not so much
<DSNesmith> don't
<JESmith71> Day After Tomorrow
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: man dat music is BOOPIN'
<DSNesmith> don't even say her name
<Canadian_Brony> HEY
<Canadian_Brony> I like that movie
<Canadian_Brony> somewhat
<Spectrum_Rush> so lottery was today?
<DSNesmith> she ruins everything she touches
<Canadian_Brony> eeyup
<Algol> she does
<Meanwhile> There any room in that mvm game?
<JESmith71> Yep
<Canadian_Brony> you missed it
<im_a_dolphin> :(
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Pause balls, I'm goin upstairs,
<Algol> and she's doing it to Halo books
<Reikim> Last I checked, there was a space or two.
<Dken2021> oh what was at the lottery?
<Spectrum_Rush> so waht won, i was at work
<Meanwhile> Ah feck it even if there isn't I'm going on tf2 anyway.
<Buytoast> you know OohShiny, you can ask me directly if you're so interested
<Canadian_Brony> What are the winning pony episodes? I missed them.
<CrimsonPhoenix> That message from Rarity that Blackgryphon animated....
<DSNesmith> welp that wasn't an autokick
<Wirisme> what's the lottery results?
<Meanwhile> Indeed, that was a Tom kick.
<Phase4> 00,02:P
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I saw that. That was pretty good.
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: say waht
<Silverscreen> 01,11Batman? 8/10. The iconic character was brought to life really well, but I felt it fell through on several things. The story felt a little rushed and half-thought through, and aside from Batman, Joker and the Viki Vale, the characters were bland and forgetable.
<CrimsonPhoenix> The more I hear it the more I'm ready to say that Tabitha herself voiced it
*Spectrum_Rush runs to check
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: Have you not seen it yet?
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix ikr? she isn't best pony for nothing <3
<DSNesmith> but honestly
<Buytoast> the episodes are yellow horse talks shit to a dragon and orange horse gets tired and shit
<OohShiny> Buytoast: so? do you ignore the real life not-thinking not-talking ponies?
<DSNesmith> Karen Traviss was the worst writer
<im_a_dolphin> Inloving memory O.o :O :'(
<Spectrum_Rush> AJIsAwesome: working, working, working
<DSNesmith> she's what made me give up on star wars EU
<mitamaking> CrimsonPhoenix: I saw it, I thought that blackgryphon got the real voices, but the post he put there made it seem otherwise
<Phase4> 00,02its just titles so meh, i could disable it easy but i'm not gona
<Buytoast> i don't live next to any real horses or ponies
<Dken2021> Dragonshy and Applebucking?
<Ghosties> 04I give Lagship Troopers a 6/10
<DSNesmith> I used to be a HUGE star wars fan
<Algol> ah
<JESmith71> Fight Club, Day After Tomorrow, Applebuck Season, and Dragonshy
<Buytoast> unless you count the ones the police ride
<DSNesmith> like
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: I got ice hair, 1 2 3 4 I got Ice Hair.
<Ghosties> 04Good characters, even if they are archetypes
<Tovler1> I'd like to see an episode with the yellow horse and orange horse together.
