<Vordox> Caramel: Well, it's interesting about severalt hings
<Gold_Demona> twilight-sprinkle: lol yup
<Ember> that games screams pinkie was here all over the place
<twilight_sprinkle> cloud has no reason to be emo
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe slightly said
<Vordox> Caramel: Like how they are trying to make the FF Grim again compared to FFVII
<twilight_sprinkle> but not so downright emo
<Applejack2012> I love Terra and Cloud
<Caramel> 2,14 all it is, is angst angst needless angst
<Bronysith> Terra is best final fantasy character, but cloud is my favorite
<RoboGerbil> Squall and Rinoa ftw
<Vordox> Caramel: Mostly, aye
<Caramel> 2,14 plus throw in a bit of: "WE'RE SAD, FEEL BAD FOR US"
<Bronysith> RoboGerbil: squall is just, ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<twilight_sprinkle> im okay with emoish characters if they have a Really serious reason to be emo, but cloud has none
<Kandarihu> Caramel, please pardon me for asking, but why are you playing this game if you hate it so much?
<Vordox> Caramel: Well everyone has a sad story for a background :P
<Ember> i have no idea what im saying, but i think sepiroth is bast char? he was baddass in the movie at least.
<Caramel> 2,14 I figured some people would like it
<RoboGerbil> lol squall was the only relatable character
<AJIsAwesome> Ember: Movie? :S
<Obsidian> Kandarihu: So the chat can make fun of it
<Caramel> 2,14 I have other games prepared if enough people ask for it
<Lil_B> all of this makes me wanna waste 4 hours and watch all of Spoonys Videos again XD
<twilight_sprinkle> sephiroth is awesome
<twilight_sprinkle> and idc what the bandwagon haters say
<Vordox> Caramel: Sazh's family, Vanille's existance, Lighting's family, Snow's circumstances, etc etc
<Ember> AJIsAwesome: yes, it was called advent cilderen or something like that
<twilight_sprinkle> spehiroth was great in ff7:cc
<AJIsAwesome> Ember: Okay.
<twilight_sprinkle> altho i think he couldve been more developed
<Lil_B> Caramel it's cool, we are united as Brothers in our Desire to bitch about this game
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, and it's all emotional drivel
<Vordox> Caramel: For most part, sadly yes. So if you cannot like the characters it gets kinda...
<Caramel> 2,14 it's poorly written, poorly designed, and an insult to what the series used to be
<Gold_Demona> Ember: You should play FF7 so Advent Children makes a little more sense.
<twilight_sprinkle> say Caramel do you have ff7: crisis core?
<Vordox> Caramel: Well, let's say apathetic. ><
<Ember> oh thats why that movie made no sence..
<Ember> derp.
<Dark_Horst> the only thing i knwo about final fantasy: sephiroth > STAB!
<Bronysith> Caramel: oy, you have any multiplayer games on the PS3?
<Gold_Demona> Ember: It's literally a sequel to the game.
<Vordox> Ember: You need to watch every single Final Fantasy to understand, Final Fantasy Spirit's Within!
<Dark_Horst> becasue somehow that was supposed to be bad
<ArcherJoe11> Evening. I had to beat this chat to get in.
<MrMalk> Anyone from england here?
<Obsidian> Hello ArcherJoe11
<Gold_Demona> Vordox: Spirits Within is NOT a Final Fantasy as far as I'm concerned
<AJIsAwesome> ArcherJoe11: Hi! :)
<Ember> i didnt know of any final fantasy game untill this stream started
<ArcherJoe11> And I played this FF. I like it.
<Applejack2012> hello
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: Ikr? Watcing Avent CHildren without playing FF7 first-- or at least watsching the Retrospective-- is like watching one big, beautiful, well crafted batch of What the FU--
*ArcherJoe11 hugs all the ponies
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: Heh I know, but it got dropped into a stigma JUST because of the name, which is sad.
<Applejack2012> grouphug
<Ember> i litterally thought it was just a movie
*Lil_B hugs ArcherJoe11 back
<AJIsAwesome> So what was the most recent FF game made?
<Vordox> Caramel: Wait, you completed the game? O.o
<MrMalk> Gives the special hug of friendshp to applejack2012
<Gold_Demona> Vordox: Yeah, it's a good movie if you ignore the "Final Fantasy" in the title.
<Caramel> 2,14 eeyup
<ArcherJoe11> Which is your favourite FF13 Character? mine is Hope.
<MrMalk> Hey AJIsAwsome
<Caramel> 2,14 because I'd be a hypocrit if I hated it without giving it a try'
<Vordox> Caramel: OH! Then you must've loved the randomness of the Scrapheap part :D
<Gold_Demona> Vordox: I hated it for a long time because of that.
<AJIsAwesome> MrMalk: Hi! :)
<Vordox> Caramel: <3 Good ideal
<Caramel> 2,14 in fact I've played through it like 7 times
<Caramel> 2,14 fuck knows why
<Vordox> Caramel: It's a good game? :P
<MrMalk> Is barbetos here AJ?
<Ember> oh wait, i was kinda lying over here D:
<Obsidian> Caramel: Boredom I take it
<ArcherJoe11> Which on Caramel? This one?
<Caramel> 2,14 if something that makes you want to stab yourself is a good game, then yes
<Lil_B> yeah, Advent Childtren WITHOUT knowing FF7="Who are these Characters, why is this happening?", watching it and having played the Game="What the F..."
<Kandarihu> Maybe it's fun to play, with it's psuedo-real-time battle system?
<Ember> i have a ff game, but its crystal chronicles
<AJIsAwesome> MrMalk: Yep. I spoke to him a while ago. 30 min., I think.
<Vordox> Caramel: Then... That dedication of 100%?
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: LOL yeah! XD
<Vordox> Lil_B: Inb4 "RUFUS" bomb
<Caramel> 2,14 more like I keep trying to find some reason to like it, and get horibly disappointed every time
<Kencolt> Ember: That really doesn't count. That really really doesn't count.
<MrMalk> AJIsAwesome when cypresswolf get on you guys are going to tell me the story
<Vordox> Caramel: I assume you haven't played FFXIII-2?
<Ember> lol, y not?
<AJIsAwesome> "Where's the soul?" I could ask you the same thing, game. :S
<Obsidian> "Where's the soul?" The though of all the fans who played this game
<Caramel> 2,14 until I find a reason to like 13, no
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: When does games have SOul?
<Gold_Demona> Advent Children STILL doesn't make much sense if you know FF7 already, but at least you can sort of follow what's going on. :P
<Vordox> Caramel: Keep digging... :P
<AJIsAwesome> Obsidian: :D
<MrMalk> Vordox GTA has soul
<Vordox> ---
<Vordox> WTF?
<Vordox> GTA?!
<Lil_B> I actually played FF7 only to the point where you get out of the City... after that I got bored :/
<Gold_Demona> Ember: Crystal Chronicles is a spin-off game. Spin offs never count.
<Dark_Horst> it'S true
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: Advent CHildren made perfect sense to me. Then again, I'm sort of an odd duck.
<MrMalk> Vodrox ya
<Vordox> MrMalk: I hope you mean 4th one
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: It made sense when I first watched it, but then I thought back on it and I was like "WTF?"
<ArcherJoe11> Kencolt: I know the FF7 story through the internet only, Still made sense for me.
<MrMalk> Vordox ya the best one
<Ember> question
<Shizuka> 13>open stream
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: Also, the intros to all the familiar characters was pretty poorly executed. :P
<Shizuka> 13>JRPG voice acting
<Ember> how old is that girl?
<Vordox> MrMalk: <3 (\
<AJIsAwesome> Why is Vanille a bad character again?
<Shizuka> 13i can't NOPE.avi fast enough
<Vordox> Lawl Shizuka :D
<Obsidian> Ohi Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome> I wasn't paying attention to her. :D
<MrMalk> Vordox I beleive they have a MLP GTA MOD
<ArcherJoe11> AJIsAwesome: because she is a stepford Smiler?
<Vordox> MrMalk: Don't have any interest in it =3
<Caramel> 2,14 to be fair, this game sucks, and we're playing it to laugh at it
<Vordox> VANILLE DAMNIT you are doing it wrong!
<Ember> seriously, how old is she?
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: fun thing is, it'S not as horrible as it culd be. except for these two kids
<Vordox> Caramel: So that's the GOOD thing about this? :P
<MrMalk> Vordox you dont want all the people to turn into ponies?
<Caramel> 2,14 for people watching maybe
<Vordox> MrMalk: Nah, I prefer 2D before 3D
<Vordox> Caramel: Oh....
<Caramel> 2,14 still sucks for the person playing :P
<Lil_B> Shizuka join us, for we are united in our effort to complain about this game!
<Vordox> Caramel: Do an autoplay then!
<twilight_sprinkle> so Caramel do you have ff7: crisis core for psp?
<Bronysith> ugh
<Bronysith> why is hope so fucking lame
<Kencolt> How come the "kid" bas a bigger rack than the main Heroine?
<AJIsAwesome> So those two are siblings?
*Magical_Pablez94 is away: DINNER nomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnom
<ArcherJoe11> Caramel: I like the game, but then, I haven't played any other FF yet. It must be better than FF14 at least.
<MrMalk> Will there be another steam sale soon?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: Japan
<alexxm> Kencolt it's japan
<Obsidian> Oh great, now you get to play as Hope
<Dark_Horst> MrMalk: christmas
<AJIsAwesome> Kencolt: Japan. Just Japan. :S
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: Because fanservice. :P
<Panda|sleepies> um... Shizuka you dont like Japanese voice acting? O-o
<Vordox> JUST A BIG WARNING FOR EVERYONE
<Vordox> Archtypes ahoy at first
<MrMalk> Dark_Horst you sure? will it be as big as summer sale?
<Kandarihu> ArcherJoe11, the only FF game I played to completion is FFVI. And it's one awesome game.
<Shizuka> 13Panda: JRPG voice acting is horrendous
<ArcherJoe11> I was so sure, Hope would end up with Vanille during these first parts.
<Dark_Horst> MrMalk: pretty much
<Lil_B> oh ... oh no ... I fibnally lost my faith in humanity :(
<Vordox> Shizuka: Ever seen Skies of Arcadia?
<Obsidian> If only you could make hope jump off that bridge
<MrMalk> Dark_Horst Thank
<ArcherJoe11> Shizuka: You must admit, this one is at least trying.
<AJIsAwesome> So those two are siblings?
<Panda> I haven't played a JRPG, so... sorry Shizuka >.<
<Obsidian> AJIsAwesome: no
<Dark_Horst> god, i havent heard one complete paragraph from her and i already wanna shoot her
<AJIsAwesome> Obsidian: Okay.
<MrMalk> SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
<Vordox> Shizuka: For most part, like Tales of series, the Voice acting is ...URGH, also somewhat linked to FFX. >.>
<alexxm> suprise buttsex
<Caramel> 2,14 Dark_Horst: welcome to the life of playing 13
<MrMalk> alexxm NOOOOOO

<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: He has a good 170, yes
<ArcherJoe11> *?
<Obsidian> ArcherJoe11: yes
<twilight_sprinkle> awkward silence
<Vordox> Caramel: He does grew, but it's a painful grow :P
<Vordox> YOUNGSTERS SHOULD NOT DRIVE
<Ember> am i the only one who just found out ff is a game and didnt know even if i have a spin off game of it?
<Caramel> 2,14 he goes from being a whiny bitch to a useless kid who can't shut his mouth
<Dark_Horst> he totally sniffed her ass there
<Caramel> 2,14 not much growth
<Vordox> Caramel: So like Vanille!
<Kandarihu> Until now, the only gripe I heard about this game is that it's really linear. I think I see that here.
<Shizuka> 13the rare two horn metal movement
<Caramel> 2,14 except Vanille is always like that
<ArcherJoe11> Hey, at least he behaves better than some other chars that do the Revenge Plot and don't catch themselves like Hope did.
<Vordox> Caramel: So it's 2 Vanille... heh :P
<Dark_Horst> what the hell does the expect from holding her hands that way
<Lil_B> and it already got 80.000$ :( why... oh why is this the kind of thing people are throwing money at?!
<Dark_Horst> she'S not on a concert
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: Hmmm, true.
<Caramel> 2,14 I beg to difer
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: Wait, he DOES have a revenge plot... slightly
<Ember> a dangerous place full of guys who want to kill you
<Caramel> 2,14 at least with most revenge plots I can sympathize
<Ember> sure, lets go investigate!
<Caramel> 2,14 he wants to kill a guy because his mother volunteered
<Caramel> 2,14 logic, I can haz?
<Bronysith> I CANT STAND HER
<Vordox> Caramel: Kids
<Vordox> NO
<Dark_Horst> godammit, STOP MAKING NOISS
<Vordox> JUST NO VANILLE
<Obsidian> well isn't that convinient
<Bronysith> Caramel: terrible writing
<Vordox> Dat Unconvinient enemy
<Vordox> BUMERANG GO
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: yes, but he at least knows when to call it quits. And Caramel. The kid is 12/13. Cut him some slack. And how many Characters beat the shit out of enemies with a Boomerang?
<Obsidian> and a boomerang out of nowhere
<Dark_Horst> Caramel: what, that blonde boy there?
<Vordox> XD
<Lil_B> well, at least teh space elevator got funded XD
<Caramel> 2,14 that's supposed to make him better?
<MrMalk> I want revenge on a guy at a dallas mcdonalds for making me wait 45 minutes extra just to get a drink
<Bronysith> AHHHHHHH i hate you vanille
<Vordox> Caramel: And really, if there is ONE character I hate in FF... It's Rinoa.
<Shizuka> 13i miss ff7..
<Gold_Demona> Sokka is best boomerang wielder.
<Caramel> 2,14 he's emotionally detached from all this fighting, and then pulls out a fucking boomerang out of nowhere
<Bronysith> Shizuka: THANK YOU
<Obsidian> Shizuka: we all do
<Vordox> Shizuka: So mainstream.. :P
<Gold_Demona> Vordox: So hipster. :P
<ArcherJoe11> Caramel: He's a kid who just lost his mom, and from his position it looked like Snow dropped her.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: it is one of the best final fantasies, being 6 and 7 that is
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: Hah ah!
<Ember> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7wJ8pE2qKU here, have some nostalgia
<Bronysith> Ember: no vid links during stream plz
<AJIsAwesome> Dat unallowed link
<Vordox> Ember: No links
<Ember> sorry D:
<Ember> didnt know
<Bronysith> Ember: dont be sorry, just dont do it, or read the rules
<Panda> Shizuka, play it again D:
<Gold_Demona> Didn't read the rules, I see
<Dark_Horst> Ember: that'S why your ead the rules
<Caramel> 2,14 from his position, he should have recognized the fact they were going to stop people from killing him. And rather than bitching at the guy who risked himself to protect them, he tries to murder him because he lost his mommy
<Vordox> MURDER
<Panda> Caramel, typical story line? O-o
<Kencolt> I've always had a warm spot for FF9. Had a really interesting leveling system, and you could make your pary eventually freakishly unstoppable.
<Vordox> Panda: Ish :P
<Panda> xD
<Bronysith> Caramel: terrilbe character
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: actually its a lot more mainstream to say that ff7 is mainstream
<Vordox> FFVII, FFVIII, FFVI, FF9, FF5 - rest
<Sylandest> afternoon, everypony :) what are we watching?
<AJIsAwesome> Who runs like that in real life? :D
<ArcherJoe11> Caramel: He gets better at least. And Snow always pokes (unknowingly) in the wound with operation NORA.
<AJIsAwesome> Sylandest: Hi! :)
<Applejack2012> hi
<Dark_Horst> AJIsAwesome: down syndrome
<Caramel> 2,14 first off, no he doesn't
<Panda> hello Sylandest... welcome.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Sylandest
<Caramel> 2,14 secondly, operation NORA is Hope's thing
<Vordox> Is NOONE here really thinking Rinoa is WORST FF character? .<
*Lil_B hugs Panda and Sylandest
<Vordox> >_>
<ArcherJoe11> Caramel: sorry, been some time since I played.
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Sylandest. We are watching Caramel play Final Fantasy XIII
<Panda> Ouch, someone doesnt know the story line
<Sylandest> howdy AJIsAwesome, Panda, MLP_Brovakiin
<Bronysith> Vordox: that is reserved for vanille
<Applejack2012> hug
*Sylandest hugs Lil_B back
*Panda glomps Lil_B
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: i have no idea who is who anyway
<Vordox> Rinoa is the "main side hero" of FFVIII..
<Vordox> I hate her big time, she's NEVER good.
<Vordox> EVER
<Vordox> Atleast Vanille has brains....ish
<Caramel> 2,14 HAH
<Obsidian> Good question
<Caramel> 2,14 oh god, I needed that laugh
<AJIsAwesome> DAT ACTING
<Kencolt> Aw, and she thought she was going to get some.
<alexxm> what is with this girl
<Dark_Horst> my guess is on brain damage
<ArcherJoe11> alexxm: Spoilers. She IS the narrator after all.
<Vordox> Caramel: Seriously! LOOK at Rinoa's story... Where is she ever GOOD?!
<Vordox> Oh yeah, most people here has NO idea about the story atm. XD
<Caramel> 2,14 don't use general terms like "good"
<Bronysith> LAGUNA FTW
<Bronysith> so far
<Caramel> 2,14 and frankly, if you can't appreciate her role in the story, then that just makes me sad more than angry
<Bronysith> what i have seen of him
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: Remember her ruining the Assassination by walking up to the sorceress.
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: thanks for spoiling bitch
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: Urgh.. don't remind me.. ><
<ArcherJoe11> Bronysith: FFVIII has been out for over 10 years. That's no spoiling anymore.
<Sumica> 00,10punch kick it's all in the mind
<alexxm> punch those robot dogs
<Vordox> Caramel: I can undersand her story, but character wise... No. She fecks up everything over and over again, gets kidnapped more then one time, FECKS up her own plans all the time...
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: okay then, so mother 3 has been out for longer
<MrMalk> Is this a prerecorded livestream?
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: so...THE WORLD ENDS IN MOTHER 3
<Vordox> Caramel: and of course the whole Vessel plot... >.>
<Obsidian> MrMalk: No, its live
<Vordox> And character development...Well... True, she did evolve somewhat.
<Panda> Sumica O_o I love you.
<Vordox> Sumica: That rappah
<ArcherJoe11> Bronysith: That's not special. IF all existance would end. THAT would be a shock.
<Sumica> 00,10Mit says mips in the top right and you are asking if it's livestream?
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: and lets see, wander is betrayed in SoTC
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: I think you'll like MysteryBen27's upcoming video then. :D
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: snape kills dumbledore
<Caramel> 2,14 sorry Vordox, but I basically can't buy anything you sell when you legitimately said Vanille is less annoying than Rinoar
<Caramel> 2,14 Rinoa*
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: lavitz dies
<Vordox> Caramel: That "less" isn't much.. =P
<Lil_B> Bronysith at least everyoner is alive at the end of mother 3 :) exepct the people who died before the end
<ArcherJoe11> Bronysith: The last one, it's my favourite Spoiler Joke.
<ArcherJoe11> The Snape Dumbledore one.
<Vordox> And I'm not saying "annoying", I said "Worst" character
<Lil_B> what I ust wrote sounded really stupid... I apologyse and try again -.-
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> Sazh for goodness sake..
<Bronysith> LIGHTNING IS PRINCESS AT SHOWING NO EMOTION
<Snow> and the door said, i forgive you
<Vordox> Bronysith: Reminds me of atleast 8 other characters in FF
<ArcherJoe11> Bronysith: I LOVE Light. She's awesome.
<Vordox> Like Adamant from FFIX
<ArcherJoe11> Cloud from 7
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: not really
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: he shows emotion plenty of times
<Sumica> 00,10reminds me of music and sound effects from armored core 2
<Vordox> Cloud showed alot of emotions... As Cloud, but not as Zack while being Cl....errgh
<Gold_Demona> Calmness, Bronysith. We get it. Your seething hatred for this game is plain as day.
<ArcherJoe11> Bronysith: sorry, Cloud from Advent Children. In looks and emo-ness?
<Snow> Vordox: wait..wha..hu..WHAT?
<Vordox> I would give the top point actually to Adamant when I think about it, his emotions are the true essence of Steel XD
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: THIS IS A GAME?!
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: the movie doesnt count
<ArcherJoe11> Bronysith: ALTERNATE CONTINUITY!!!
<Bronysith> ArcherJoe11: in the game he shows plenty of emotions, from sadness to laughing and such
<Sumica> 00,10by the time the music gets good the fight is over
<Vordox> Sumica: Caramel is just that good.
<ArcherJoe11> Bronysith: Batman has shown emotion too. Most just remember his brooding.
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, see how good I am at pressing X?
<Vordox> YEAH, that skillz man, Caramel is the best FFXIII playah
<Snow> your pressing X like a baws caramel
<Obsidian> Press X to win
<Bronysith> THIS GAME SUCKS
<Snow> its like installing windows 7
<Lil_B> Caramel A winner is you
<Snow> press 25 times enter to instal
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith! Dude! Seriously with the caps, man!
<Vordox> So...
<Kandarihu> Snow, only if you like all the defaults
<Vordox> Anyone tlel me 3 reasons why Rinoa is a good character?(Actually BEING good, not TALKING good)
<Caramel> 2,14 Vordox: does that sentence even make sense to you?
<Sumica> 00,10press r1 dueeing attack to do more damage >_>
<Gold_Demona> ^HATE that mechanic
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: She makes the game play Eyes on Me?
<CCCP> hi
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo CCCP
<Obsidian> Hello CCCP
<ArcherJoe11> hey CCCP
<Snow> oh god, is it THAT kind of character?
<Gold_Demona> If I wanna hear Eyes on Me, I just open iTunes
<MLP_Brovakiin> hello CCCP
<Lil_B> hia CCCP ;)
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: Hi! :)
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: Reason 2: She uses the DOGLAUNCHER!!!
*CCCP huggs Gold_Demona Obsidian ArcherJoe11 MLP_Brovakiin Lil_B and AJIsAwesome
<Vordox> Caramel: I'm just very certain about my choice of worst character. When I played the games, I always avoid Rinoa cause she's never used for anything good as a story character OR character development? The whole Assassination plan mishaps, possessing, Vessel for Witch, Family rebellion. The ONLY good thing she did AS said, was the whole Train act. >.>
<MrMalk> HI CCCP my name is malk whats youres
<Obsidian> dat wall
<Snow> dat post
<Snow> it scared me
<Caramel> 2,14 ...are you kidding?
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: Doglauncher is a weapon.. and Angelo is used twice in the game =P
<Lil_B> btw... whats the name of that Planet they are on again?
<CCCP> MrMalk wat
*CCCP nomz MrMalk
<Vordox> Caramel: No, unless there is something I really missed.
<Obsidian> inb4 counterpost
<Caramel> 2,14 she's the entire pivotal keystone for Squall's development
<Caramel> 2,14 like seriously, did you even PLAY the game?
*MrMalk nomz on CCCP
<Vordox> Caramel: Several times. actually. Mostly 100% it
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: Reason 3: She DE-Emo's Squall/Leon/Whatever.
*MrMalk says CCCP you need some pepper
<Snow> wait is that possible?
<Vordox> So...
<Caramel> 2,14 well then you didn't pay much attention to it
<CCCP> MrMalk :I
<Snow> de-emo someone?
*Bronysith murders Snow
<Vordox> I did, Caramel, there's a reason I put FFVIII as second favourite FF.
*MLP_Brovakiin gives CCCP some pepper :3
<Gold_Demona> ArcherJoell: His name is Squall, even in Kingdom Hearts, but in KH he goes by Leon as an alias.
<Snow> waht was that for?
<ArcherJoe11> Snow: You replace the Emo-ness with Love.
<Lil_B> gotta throw in the FF13 Soundtrack again... I remember thinking it was Meh ... (not bad, but I didn't like it)
<Sumica> 00,10not what was the worst part about ff8, accidentally spreading crapy rules in triple triad
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: So if you "De emo" characters it'a good characteR? Hai Hope/Vanille
<MrMalk> CCCP mabye we could stew you or something in some fresh chicken broth steak blood mix
<Alchemist> ff4 is the only game I played with from that franchise and I didnt even finish it. It just doesn't appeal to me.
*Snow is sad
*CCCP hugz Snow
<alexxm> whats the matter Snow
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: That's why I like Hope after he gets over the revenge part.
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: Oh...

*MLP_Brovakiin also hugs Snow :3

<Polydunami> dat FFXIII :D
<Alchemist> good evening everyone
*Vordox gives Phoenix Down to Snow
<Obsidian> Hello Alchemist
*Snow revives
<Kencolt> Sumica: At least Triple Triad made some sense, even with bad rules. The game after that in FF9-- I forget what it was called, but that was just a big bowl of "How does this even WORK?"
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Hi! :)
<MrMalk> Good evening sir your a gentleman and a scholar Phoenix
<Vordox> Dat delusion, Snow...
<Bronysith> Snow: nothing personal, you are just from a terrible game, thats all
<Obsidian> dat echo
<alexxm> how are things Alchemist
<Snow> ...
<Snow> what game then?
<Lil_B> hi there Alchemist :)
<Bronysith> Snow: final fantasy 13
<Alchemist> alexxm: its been better alexxm, thanks for asking. But then again its been worse too.
<Caramel> 2,14 "what should I do?" Grow up and get the fuck over it
<Vordox> Caramel: Truth
<MrMalk> Bronysith Seems Legit
<Gold_Demona> Well, I'm gonna get going for the day. See y'all tomorrow Bronystate.
<Obsidian> Caramel: Agreed
<CCCP> bye Gold_Demona
<Vordox> Worst motivational Speaker = goes to.... VANILLE!
<Obsidian> Bye Gold_Demona
<Spectrum_Rush> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/ManUp.jpg
<MrMalk> bye Gold_Demona
<AJIsAwesome> Gold_Demona: Bye! :)
<CCCP> i just watched the human centipede =/
<ArcherJoe11> Caramel: That takes some more Chapters.
<Lil_B> bye Gold_Demona
<Obsidian> CCCP: Why?
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: Why? :S
<Caramel> 2,14 I'm aware archerjoe
<Vordox> Dat 5 star pro play, Caramel
<Snow> im actually my own OC so dont compare me with anyone bronysith!
<MrMalk> CCCP I was peer pressured into saying Why?
<CCCP> Obsidian and AJIsAwesome and MrMalk its not that gross really
<Vordox> Caramel: After stream, I would like to have an arguement with you about Rinoa, if you want to that is.
<CCCP> its just pretty boring
<Applejack2012> bye
<CCCP> im gonna watch part 2 today
<CCCP> bye Applejack2012
<Caramel> 2,14 that doesn't at all sound interesting to me, no offense
<Sylandest> laters Applejack2012
<Obsidian> Bye Applejack2012
<Lil_B> bye Applejack2012
<Caramel> 2,14 but fanboy arguing isn't really my favorite past-time
<Vordox> Caramel: none taken, opinions, that's all.
<AJIsAwesome> Applejack2012: Bye! :)
<Vordox> It's not about fanboy, heck I'm not a FF fanboy at all.
<Snow> well, i better get going to, later!
<Vordox> I just love to analyze stuff.
<CCCP> bye Snow <3
<AJIsAwesome> Snow: Bye! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Applejack2012
*Snow waves
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnbye Snow
<Lil_B> bye Snow
<Obsidian> Bye Snow
<Applejack2012> Bye snow
<Sumica> 00,10this game needs more ponies
<Vordox> Wasn't there Robots pony later...? <.<
<CCCP> ponies are overrated :P
<ArcherJoe11> Sumica: No, they would be Mecha Zombie Ponies at best.
<Vordox> Or was that FFXIII-2...
<Obsidian> Sumica: There's a summon that turns into a horse later
<Polydunami> L'cie about that.
<Lil_B> Vordox do you know something about FF13-Versus?
<Vordox> Lil_B: You mena FFXIII-3?
<ArcherJoe11> Considering what happens later in the game and what we find out, it makes sense that Vanille knows that much about L'Cie.
<Kencolt> What I'm trying to figure out is why, in a sterile SF high tech city, Vanille's weapon is apparently a pair of antlers tied to a tree branch.
<alexxm> why are these battles so short
<Lil_B> Vordox they renamed it? As far as I know they worked on 13-2 and 13-Versus at the same time
<Vordox> Vanille... you are WAY too..."Euh euh SQUEE"
<ArcherJoe11> Kencolt: Antique Weaponry.
<Obsidian> Kencolt: Explained later
<CCCP> some one tell me the goriest movie so i can watch it :P
<Vordox> Obsidian: Dat EVA logic
<Vordox> CCCP: EVil Dead(The LucasArt one?)
<Obsidian> Cue emo mode
<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: Saw is more of a gore film then horroe, them films are messed up :P
<CCCP> Vordox ive already seen it though =/
<Vordox> CCCP: Dangit
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #561
<Lil_B> ok, FF13 music is kinda unique in FF-music, way way lest orchestra and more other styles, but I generally find it to be lacking :/
<Polydunami> Vanille kind of scares me.
<ArcherJoe11> Not Emo yet, Still emotional. Emo comes later after the first chapter.
<Vordox> Polydunami: She's like this for a certain reason. :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: But it is a relitivly good choise for gore films
<CCCP> MLP_Brovakiin =/ i heard they wernt that good but okies :3
<Polydunami> I know that much, Vordox
<CCCP> Vordox dangit? wat
<Polydunami> That's what scares me.
<Vordox> CCCP: Yeah, she has a reason for why's she so..."Cherpy"
<applejack`> hello
<CCCP> waaaat
<CCCP> hi applejack`
<Vordox> <--- Dat forced Dictatorship of the Fal'cie.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello applejack`
<Vordox> Sazh, not helping dude.
<AJIsAwesome> applejack`: Hi! :)
<MrMalk> Has anyone played smite?
<applejack`> ;D

<Vordox> HATE STORY EMO HATE
<Polydunami> http://blogs.gartner.com/jenny-sussin/files/2011/12/50436494.jpg Seriously, this is what I think of when I see Vanille.
<CCCP> the worst game ever might be a game called "Escape from Atlantis"
<Vordox> You're going to regret saying that, Lightning =P
<CCCP> on the NES
<Lil_B> Vordox I only aked about Versus.13 because I know Yoko Shimomura is making the music for it and one siong was on her "drammatica" CD... which released in 2008
<ArcherJoe11> Sazh is awesome. He's like the most awesome [Spoiler] Character ever.
<Vordox> Lil_B: I really don't know much about the th...versus what ever number it is, atm.
<Obsidian> CCCP: No, that title goes to E.T. for the Atari 2600
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: He's one of the better characters... mostly
<Lil_B> ok :(
<Polydunami> Sazh is my favourite character in this game
<Vordox> Obsidian: DR Jekyll and MR Hyde... But eveyr other Atari games with crap coding wins that XD
<CCCP> Obsidian i own that game its bad but no where as bad as Escape From Atlantis trust me
<tSparx> Good afternoon everypony!
<CCCP> hi tSparx
<CCCP> i got my ataria 2600 on Ebay and half the games are broken ;~;
<Polydunami> Hello there, tSparx!
<CCCP> atari*
<Lil_B> hia tSparx :)
<Vordox> CCCP: Get Vectrex instead :P
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Hi! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya tSparx
<CCCP> Vordox whats that?
<Lil_B> Vordox dem Vectors XD
<Vordox> CCCP: Just write in Vectrex on googl enad you'll see. :D I love those old games
<Obsidian> I need to head out for the moment. bbl everypony.
<CCCP> the virtual boy is also EXTREAMLY underrated
*tSparx glomps CCCP, Polydunami, AJIsAwesome , and MLP_Brovakiin (unless you don't want glompage, in which case I didn't ;)
<BladedWings> bue Obsidian
<Vordox> Still got your brain, Caramel ?
<CCCP> Vordox okies :3
<Sumica> 00,10I still have a Vetrex
*AJIsAwesome accepts glomp
<Caramel> 2,14 ....what>
<Vordox> Sumica: <3
<MLP_Brovakiin> tSparx: I'm totaly cool with that :3
<tSparx> ciao Obsidian
<Vordox> Caramel: Button mashing and story atm.
<tSparx> Damn English and its lack of 2nd person singular/plural distinctions :P
<Caramel> 2,14 I'm using my big toe to play
<Caramel> 2,14 while I do other things
<Vordox> Caramel: Hah! Dem Skills
<Kandarihu> tSparx, you/all of you
<Vordox> "What is this Ezmode you speak of"?
<tSparx> Kandarihu: But you can mean 2nd person singular or plural.
<CCCP> History at times seems like the only interesting subject in school =C
<Vordox> CCCP: Get into Human Psychology, ish awesomez
<tSparx> Kandarihu There's no clear distinction, other than context, to let people know you're only talking to one person. Damn English: P
<Lil_B> Jesus Christ.... the Kid Icarus Upriding Full Soundtrack Page is filled with all the names of persons who played the Instruments XD
<CCCP> Vordox that sounds kinda interesting :)
<Kandarihu> tSparx, yeah, I guess so
<Vordox> CCCP: It is, once you get a good basic grip on humans understanding and brain functions, you'll start to play with Triggers.
<Vordox> Some for good, some for bad.
<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: tHE ONLY THING I LIKE IN SCHOOL IS MY ENGINEERING DIPLOMA :/
<Vordox> And some for dictatorships(I'm looking at you, History)
<tSparx> Kandarihu: I mean, *I'm* than comfortable using thou (and its associated -st conjugations), but no one else wants to bother with it, haha.
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Wait, where di you find the soundtrack?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Oh shite dat caps lock :$
<CCCP> Vordox i can manipulate people? :o >:3
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome the info or the download?
<alexxm> back soon
<Vordox> CCCP: Don't abuse it.
<Vordox> Some people never understand why they do things.
<Polydunami> You'll get the thought police on your tail, CCCP :O
<CCCP> MLP_Brovakiin the only thing im annoyed by in that statement is the first letter :P
<Vordox> ^ what Polydunami said
<CCCP> Polydunami D:

<Lil_B> Motoi Sakuraba, Yasunori Mitsuda, Yuzo Koshiro, Masafumi Takada, Noriyuki Iwadare, Takahiro Nishi... they got teh pure Sound Elite for this Simple 3DS Game -.-

<ArcherJoe11> Is that how Crystal Ponies are made?
<tSparx|KerBALLIN> cya CCCP
<Vordox> lawl ArcherJoe11
<VenHur> Oh my god, WarioLand: Shake it?! I loved this game, epsectially the art direction...
<Polydunami> I don't know about you guys, but I'd want to make a cool pose before I turn to crystal :3
<Vordox> Yay, I'm eternally alive...
<Vordox> Polydunami: Does the Johnny Bravo Dance
<BladedWings|Dishes> paunch
<Vordox> THANK YOU LIGHTNING
<Polydunami> Actually, a silly pose would be funnier.
<VenHur> SERIOUSLY, if Nintendo have to time to make a brand new Mario cartoon, THIS would of been the art style.
<Vordox> Well..
<VenHur> *the
<BladedWings|Dishes> brb guys, got some dishes to defeat
<Vordox> She got crystals... which are jewelry.. So should be happy eternal life?
<ArcherJoe11> That's why I like her. She punches Snow, who is the character who is MOST capable of annoying me.
<ArcherJoe11> You mean the Government is...EVIL??!!
<ArcherJoe11> *dun dun duuuuun*
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: No, POLITICS are
*tSparx|KerBALLIN is a PoliSci major >_>
<Vordox> MAN UP HOPE
<Polydunami> WELLP. Time for us to become like them.
<ArcherJoe11> See here: Realistic Reaction to almost death by a 14 year old.
<tSparx|KerBALLIN> Nah, I'm just joshin' ya
<Vordox> And now inb4 another Mind feck(This one actually confuzzled me big time)
<Polydunami> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/616/qb.jpg I'd like to make a contract with you.
*ArcherJoe11 shoots Kyuubei in the face. "How about no"
<Vordox> Caramel: Getting Toe ache yet? :P
<Polydunami> Things remind me of other things :P
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<Vordox> Damn those graphics are wonderful
<ArcherJoe11> hey FillyFlam
<Sylandest> howdy FillyFlam
<Polydunami> Hey there, FillyFlam
<AJIsAwesome> DAT ACTING
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello FillyFlam
<AJIsAwesome> FillyFlam: Hi!
<Vordox> Not helping Lightning =P
<MASF123|> meh Vodox
<MASF123|> Vordox
<Vordox> MASF123|: Mmmmmyes?
<AJIsAwesome> Final boss already?
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: Hur hur hur
<ArcherJoe11> [Spoiler] How did Queen say? "Who wants to live Foreve?"
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> boss tiem ? boss time.
<Vordox> I know Vanille...
<Vordox> =<
<Vordox> Smooth Hope, smooth.
<MASF123|> Vordox those graphics are meh
<Vordox> YAHooo
<Bronysith> WHO WANTS TO SEE a funny yet extremely suggestive pic?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> little chocobo is the best charcater in this game
<Caramel> 2,14 bronysith: no
<Polydunami> What else is new, Bronysith?
<ArcherJoe11> Sazh: "My Chocobo gives me Super Aiming abillity."
<Vordox> MASF123|: I say they are pretty much one of the big reasons this was decent game... =P
<Bronysith> Caramel: no problem
<Vordox> Sazh is all about style while shooting.
<Bronysith> Vordox: and no accuracy
<Vordox> Bronysith: He's gangsta Ballet style :P So of course not
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: But he still hits.
<Polydunami> It'd be impossible not to hit with this fatass :D
<ArcherJoe11> And with a full meter his pistols fuse into a rifle.
<Polydunami> :3
<Caramel> 2,14 funny how every black character in FF uses guns
<Bronysith> Caramel: oh fuck ur right
<Vordox> Caramel: Barret....err...
<Barbetos|AtWork> How many black characters have there been?
<Vordox> Caramel: Kiros?
<ArcherJoe11> Fal'Cie: You killed me. So I give you these Super Powers and a Vision to save the World. Have fun.
<Vordox> Big MINDFECK time
<Kencolt> Caramel: Well, Barret IS a gun-- when he's not a totally insane melee weapon.
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: <.< That spoilerific narrative
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, I'm going to be away the entire weekend; I'm missing Brony Movie Night.
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: I spoil Ten Minutes into the future.
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: Guess what
<Vordox> BAD STUFF HAPPENS
<Vordox> Oh yeah it's a spoiler, did I mention that? =P
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: NO, REALLY? I would have never guessed.
<Vordox> Oh mai
<Vordox> Who was watching Day after Tommorow?
<Sylandest> lol
<Sylandest> and swimming lyra...lol
<Vordox> Dat Narrator Vanille man...
<Polydunami> Ugh, that movie really gets on my nerves.
<Kandarihu> Wow. I think I came literally within seconds of my laptop's battery running out
<Vordox> Oh yeah, this flashback
<ArcherJoe11> I never finished the game. I stopped at GP. Then I needed to give the game back.
<Kencolt> And we pick up at the local diner. Makes sense.
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Context?
<ArcherJoe11> Vordox: More specific please. There are many of these.
<Cypresswolf> Advent Children?
<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: First flashback =P
<Vordox> THERE SHE IS
<Vordox> One of the better characters =P
<Caramel> 2,14 better because you never have to play as her...and she's barely in the game
<Vordox> Caramel: Says a bit, eh
<Caramel> 2,14 oh, you were talking about Fang
<Kencolt> Is there a reason she's dressed like a Catholic Schoolgirl?
<Caramel> 2,14 never mind then
<Polydunami> Oh, Lebreau. Why are you so beautiful?
<Polydunami> Also, stockings.
<Vordox> Caramel: Ayup, Fang
<Caramel> 2,14 meh
<Caramel> 2,14 she's bland...but that's pretty much the best this game has to offer
<Vordox> Caramel: So.. Caramel. whose your favourite "Side" hero of FF? :)
<Vordox> Caramel: Dat negativity, but yeah I understand. ><
<Kandarihu> I had to move my computer over to another room for a few hours. I had it plugged in for this. After that, I brought it back to the normal spot and forgot to plug it in. Then I brought up PSO2, because I'd been gone too long. I was fighting a boss when Windows was warning me that the battery was down to 11%. So I dropped a Telepipe, hoping to run off next chance I got. Then it gave me an even more dire warning, so I used that
<Kandarihu> telepipe and plugged my computer back in
<Caramel> 2,14 depends on your definition of "side" hero
<Vordox> Caramel: Playable, but not a hero(Like Snow f ex)
<cowvarkian> <.<
<AJIsAwesome> Incoming Sonic 06 vibes. :D
<Vordox> <.<
<Caramel> 2,14 Red XIII
<Vordox> OH MAI; so Azn
<Polydunami> Oho!
<Vordox> Caramel: Ooooh, interesting!
<alexxm> acting
<cowvarkian> alexxm: "acting" or acting
<Vordox> Caramel: Thought you would go Balthier, really.
<Vordox> Caramel: but yeah, Nakai was a pretty good side hero.
<Caramel> 2,14 I've repressed 12 out of my memory
<Polydunami> 12? What's that?
<Vordox> Caramel: Even with characters like Balthier and Fran? D:
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, Fran.
<Kandarihu> What? I heard nothing but good things about 12
<Caramel> 2,14 they ruined one of the most incredible beginnings/early game
<Vordox> DUDE! You're flirting ABOUT her sister AND her.. XD
<Caramel> 2,14 and threw away a perfectly good story
<Vordox> Caramel: Oh? The war part?
<AJIsAwesome> This seems so cheesy, IMO.
<Caramel> 2,14 it IS cheesy
<cowvarkian> oh, is this the movie that the animators took like, 500 hours on one hair?
<Vordox> IT is the new Eyes on Me!
<Polydunami> Well, they've had practice with eight, AJIsAwesome :3
<MASF123|> Caramel...
<Caramel> 2,14 it's cheesier than Tidus going to the carnival place in FF7 while wrapped in a suit of cheese
<MASF123|> your font it's different.
<Caramel> 2,14 no, this is my normal color
<Vordox> Caramel: Trying to remember the FF12 intro, it's the part with the prince?
<MASF123|> oh
<Kencolt> Caramel: WHhile wat5ching the pirates put on a play about romantic cheese.
<cowvarkian> whilst eating cheese
<Polydunami> You play as Reks; Vaan's brother, Vordox.
<cowvarkian> wait, that was a cutscene?
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Vordox> Polydunami: Hmm, should go watch for remembering, all I see is the damn war part with the prince causing a huge start. ><
<cowvarkian> why was I surprised that was a cutscence
<cowvarkian> *cutscene
<Polydunami> I only know of these things because of HC Bailly :P
<cowvarkian> So, they still make turn based role playing games?
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Lil_B> Hirokazu Tanaka is the best ... just wanted to throw that out there
<cowvarkian> whatever you say george
<cowvarkian> well hope, thats how time works
<LunarRepublicGuard> ello everypony
<cowvarkian> hey
<Polydunami> Hey there, LunarRepublicGuard
<Lil_B> hia LunarRepublicGuard
<AJIsAwesome> LunarRepublicGuard: Hi! :)
<cowvarkian> why do I feel that this is one big metaphor for something
<Caramel> 2,14 quick....now kill her
<CK|GW2> Oh god.
<cowvarkian> Caramel: thats better
<Sylandest> XD
<CK|GW2> Sounds like George Lucas wrote those lines.
<boneragerollapolla2> glug glug glug glug
<cowvarkian> CK|GW2: maybe he did
<cowvarkian> in another life
<CK|GW2> "I don't like sand...."
<Vordox> Ooooh!
<Polydunami> I like it when Hope and Vanille flirt :D
<Vordox> Now I remember Reks
<Vordox> D:
<cowvarkian> Polydunami: that was flirting?
<Lil_B> CK|GW2 Spoony reference?
<CK|GW2> That looks a lot like the sphere grid from FFX. O.o
<Vordox> cowvarkian: Never seen FFX Tidus and Yuna flirt? =P
<Polydunami> You mean that wasn't?
<cowvarkian> I thought that was mindless bullshit
<CK|GW2> Lil_B: Technically Star Wars Ep 2 reference, but yes.
<cowvarkian> maybe this is why I never get dates
<Polydunami> Pfft.
<CK|GW2> Vordox: OH GOD THE MENTAL IMAGE GET IT OUT
<Vordox> cowvarkian: Relationships are mindless? XD
<Lil_B> CK|GW2 can't wait for him to start the FF13 Review
<Vordox> CK|GW2: XD Sorry
<cowvarkian> Vordox: are they not?
<Vordox> cowvarkian: ... No comment
<cowvarkian> Vordox: so, yes
<LunarRepublicGuard> Vordox: that was tidus n yuna?
<CK|GW2> Tidus and Yuna flirting was so awkward that I wanted to hang myself from the nearest bridge every time they stopped the plot railroad for more of that. >_>
<Lil_B> CK|GW2 excuse me while I laugh like Tidus
<CK|GW2> I maintain that FFX would have been a great game if it had about half of the roster.
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, I forgot about Tidus and Yuna. I was thinking more of Squall and Rinoa.
<Vordox> Polydunami: Emotionless and Annoying?
*cowvarkian has never played a final fantasy game
<cowvarkian> Vordox: relationships with anyone?
<CK|GW2> Had they removed Tidus, Rikku, and Wakka....
<Vordox> CK|GW2: Rikku!?
<CK|GW2> Then you have a solid cast of characters for the most part, absolutely no whiny drama, and still have a great narrative.
<cowvarkian> well, more like draining and sad
<cowvarkian> *depressing
<CK|GW2> Yes, Rikku. Ms. Jailbait herself.
<VenHur> Lol
<Polydunami> But then you'd have no Tara Strong :(
<CK|GW2> Her very existence is the most disturbing sort of fanservice. >_>
<CK|GW2> Yes, and I've forgiven Tara for that sin.
<CK|GW2> (c wut I did thar)
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Polydunami> -_(\
<CK|GW2> Admit it, you laughed. If only on the inside.
<Lil_B> *listening to Loco Rococ Sountrack* ... suddenly French Gilr Voice instead of Fake Language kids ...
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: seems legit
<CK|GW2> ....are they attacking Ho-oh?
<cowvarkian> sure, why not
<cowvarkian> since I have no idea what that is
*cowvarkian has had this conversation before btw
<Vordox> omg I saw a paradigm shift
<Polydunami> Geeze, those sounds Vanille makes. They creep me out.
<CK|GW2> Well, the combat is certainly flashy....but it's hard for me to gauge how much substance it has. :/
<cowvarkian> CK|GW2: none?
<Polydunami> http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/6/67/250Ho-Oh.png/160px-250Ho-Oh.png
<cowvarkian> Polydunami: oh, then yes
<cowvarkian> Polydunami: I thought it sounded familiar
<CK|GW2> I was pretty fond of FFX's combat, actually.
<LunarRepublicGuard> i really need 2 get back in to the ff series
<CK|GW2> It's probably the best I've seen in the series.
<cowvarkian> even though it's a pokemon
<Vordox> CK|GW2: I loved the Sphere Dress system in FFX-2, was fun to level
<CK|GW2> It remains fast-paced, but the fact that there's generally tactics to it that make you swap characters on the fly, I like that.
<CK|GW2> It's just a shame the sphere grid rapidly becomes abusable, or it'd work quite well.
<Vordox> Dat big jelly
<BronyInstrumental> hey guys :)
<cowvarkian> ohai
<Lil_B> hi BronyInstrumental :)
<Polydunami> So are we in an open area for once?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello BronyInstrumental :)
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: Hi! :)
<CK|GW2> Suddenly it's a chase scene.
<BronyInstrumental> this looks like final fantasy
<cowvarkian> because it is
<CK|GW2> I'm guessing 13 since I don't recognize the characters.
<BronyInstrumental> which one?
<cowvarkian> all of them
<cowvarkian> at once
*cowvarkian doesnt know
<CK|GW2> I honestly don't know but I'm betting 13. :P
<Polydunami> This is thirteen, yeah.
<Kencolt> it's 13. Trust me.
<CK|GW2> Think this is the one Yahtzee said was basically "run down a linear corridor for the entire game"
<BronyInstrumental> yeah, it looks a lot like 13-2
<Resonantwaves> wazaaaaaaaaaaah
<Resonantwaves> O_O
<CK|GW2> Ah, good to know I can still spot FF at a glance.
<CK|GW2> I don't know if that speaks all that well of me, though.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Is that a bad thing?
<CK|GW2> Probably means I'm too buried in RPGs.
<Buytoast> What's this?
<Caramel> 2,14 where in the damn hell is that monstert
<Buytoast> This that Final Fantasy 13 game?
<Barbetos|AtWork> FF has gotten so generic you can spot it with a glance.
<Caramel> 2,14 jesus christ...this game even sucks when it's open ende
<MASF123|> Lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> is 200,000 gil a lot in this one?
<Polydunami> At this point in the game?
<Wrek> 05still val streaming?
<Buytoast> So I'm guessing it is a Final Fantasy game?
<Wrek> 05im back btw ^_^
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wrek yes
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Polydunami> Hello, GilDash
<AJIsAwesome> GilDash: Hi! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello GilDash :)

<LunarRepublicGuard> ello GilDash
<GilDash> I'll be back in a bit. Need to restart. :D
<Bronysith> oh hey Wrek
<BronyInstrumental> so sazh, lightning, them i recognise
<CK|GW2> "Fingers of Stone"
<CK|GW2> O.o
<CK|GW2> Is that the name of the region?
<Bronysith> he is in process of making the plushie Wrek , then i pay him, etc, he send to you, you do odin knows what with her (hug the living crap out of her)
<CK|GW2> Why would you call a place "Fingers of Stone"?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am glad that Chrono trigger was not made today, cuase it would probably be like this.
<Bronysith> Barbetos|AtWork: yup
<CK|GW2> Well that was fast.
<BronyInstrumental> what's the name of that mage? is it fang?
<Barbetos|AtWork> that is the first 3 star I have seen.
<BronyInstrumental> or perhaps vanille...
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder how it rates the battles
<Barbetos|AtWork> Probably by how happy Lyra is.
<BronyInstrumental> okay yeah, that's vanille
<LunarRepublicGuard> *throws care package*
<Barbetos|AtWork> I think the Last Ramnant had a battle system very much like this one
<Barbetos|AtWork> Not sure though. I own it but have not played it but maybe 30 minutes
<Lil_B> homestuck... is long ...
<GilDash> Holla again! Back from restart. :)

<Caramel> 2,14 btw, just tell me when you're sick of this game, and I will *happily* switch
<CK|GW2> xD
<ekips> what is this game anyway?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello SuperBrony63 :D
<Lil_B> hia SuperBrony63 :) finally finalised the DP Design, now I "only" have to make the animation
<Wrek> 05Caramel: i dont have any obligations left so if you need a break im ready to take ovah xD
<Caramel> 2,14 it's not necessarily a break I need, so much as the pains of playing this game :P
*Bronysith murders Caramel
<AJIsAwesome> Caramel: You can switch if you want to, we probably wouldn't mind.
<Bronysith> Caramel: that should help, death is a better alternative to this "game"
<Wrek> 05Caramel: deus ex on realistic, baton kills ONLY
<Wrek> 05with all bonus missions
<Bronysith> and suddenly silence
<killerpony7733> Wrek Gotta OCD~
<Wrek> 05ocd?
<Vordox> Gotta Baton them all
<Wrek> 05I'll give you a big grey ribbon if you brush your teeth and slap me in the behind. right near the snakebite.
<Lil_B> feels like 30 pics/pages into homestuck... finally reached the freaking title card -.-
<Gaston> No one Baston's better than Gaston!
<Bronysith> Wrek: WHAT THE FUCK!?
*Bronysith murders gast
<Bronysith> gast ah he gone
<Lil_B> anyway, I'm done for taday, see you all tomorrow :)

<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6562032896
<soulrider95> Anyone else ready for Armored Kill tomorrow?!?
<Bronysith> what?
<soulrider95> new BF3 expansion
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I bought that
<Polydunami> Back.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I forgot all about it.
<Bronysith> dont really care for BF3, probably going to trade it in for something else
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Rhythm is Magic - Remix Apple Apple Apple
<Barbetos|AtWork> I guess I will play it.
<Ryunosuke> BF3 is overrated imo
<soulrider95> I really like bf3 hahaha
<Polydunami> WELLP. Here we go again with the rhythm is magic.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its alright, but BF2 it ain't, which is the game I liked the most.
<soulrider95> I unfotunatly missed BF2, and most of bad company 2
<Bronysith> Caramel: do you have any multiplayer games on PS3?
<Wrek> 05but yeah val
<Wrek> 05Caramel
<Wrek> 05the queues are updated
<Wrek> 05and you got about an hour'
<Polydunami> You know, Bronysith, that YOLO can be used as a warning.
<Polydunami> As in, don't drink and drive. YOLO.
<Yahooz> then again, YOLO, why not?
<Bronysith> ^
<Bronysith> how long does this movie last for?
<LunarRepublicGuard> is this a limit move
<Caramel> 2,14 didn't you JUST stream Wrek?
<Polydunami> That's the thing: if you only live once, you might want to make sure you don't die. Because you don't get to have fun if you're dead.
<soulrider95> dead isnt fun
<Bronysith> Polydunami: but if you only live once, then you would want to go all out
<MLP_Brovakiin> soulrider95: Not with that attitude!
<soulrider95> MLP_Brovakiin: That may be, just not for me :3
<Bronysith> Caramel: so do you have any multiplayer games on PS3?
<Polydunami> That argument only works if you know you're going to die anyway, Bronysith.
<Polydunami> As in, near the end.
<MadSurge> Hey guys, I'm back!
<Polydunami> Hey there, MadSurge!

<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: talk about a birthday present :D
<Dovah> MLP_Brovakiin: then that explains why your exited about a moped

<DashWithRainbows> Nice killerpony7733. I'll probably be gettig a new gaming mouse, some cash and maybe a large bottle of Jack D. Seeing that this laptop was an extremely early b-day present...
<tSparx> Haha, excited young teens talking about getting drunk on their 21st/18th birthday, hahaha.
<Bronysith> jontron plays slender...]
<Hipster-Pony> I'm to lazy to read all those chats :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dovah: Oh, I have had a motor bike scince I was 13, but just not a road leagal one :P
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Not me. :P
<Bronysith> i dont feel like playing anything right now
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Well i could afford a pretty god damn powerful gaming laptop which costs about 20k in my currency
<Dovah> tSparx: have you had a drink called The Four Horsemen?
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: He did?
<DashWithRainbows> What's your currency?
<Cypresswolf> :) My first time drinking is why I do my heavy drinking at home - helps to have a bar in walking distance ^_^
<DashWithRainbows> Mine is a pretty good one, got it for £330 from PC World.
<tSparx> Dovah: Nope. I don't really drink (except my love wine)
<killerpony7733> I'm thinking about it but i'm mostly getting alot of cash. DashWithRainbows DK(Danish Krones/crowns for english peps)
<Cypresswolf> Wish they still served steaks though...
<Applejack2012> I domn
<Applejack2012> I don't drink either
<Cypresswolf> :) but then again, the chef at the bar never marinated with whiskey
<MadSurge> O__o more Deus Ex?
<Hipster-Pony> his voice kinda reminds me of cry
<DashWithRainbows> Well, if you have the cash, go for a gaming desktop.
<Cypresswolf> those are some serious veins O_o
<Hipster-Pony> SHE UUUUGGGGGLLLYYY
<DashWithRainbows> Laptops are good and all, but it's bloody hard to upgrade them unlike desktops.
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Sadly i lack alot of space for that laptop is my only and best option due to mobility and less size~
<DashWithRainbows> Fair enough.
<DashWithRainbows> I had to do the same.
<Cypresswolf> Is this the original Deus Ex?
*AJIsAwesome has never had steak. :D
<tSparx> Not that I have a problem with drinking -- I certainly'll accept any drink offered to me as long as it doesn't taste like piss. But, y'know, why try to get drunk when you enjoy other substance uses more?
<DashWithRainbows> But I'll be giving my mom this laptop when I get a good desktop.
<Hipster-Pony> too much beer
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: You are missing out :P
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: I know. :D
<tSparx> And by "doesn't taste like piss" I really mean "isn't beer," haha
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: Do you ever smoke (not cigarettes, the other thing)?
<Cypresswolf> AJIsAwesome: when you turn 21, I'll grill you one with my own recipe :)
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows I live in a horribly small apartment with three family members and yeah space in the room i loan is less then ideal
<DashWithRainbows> tSparx Don't drink Strongbow.
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Okay. :)
<DashWithRainbows> It tastes horrible.
<Dovah> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster
<Dovah> under real life section
<DashWithRainbows> And being a cider, you won't get that much of a buzz from it.
<Barbetos|AtWork> My sister brought me a bag of candy for my birthday. :3 om nom nom
<DashWithRainbows> Go for vodka, double shot it.
<MLP_Brovakiin> tSparx: Nope, I plan on never taking any drugs what so ever. besides my dad would kill me :P
<tSparx> I would drink a GargleBlaster in a heart-beat
<Barbetos|AtWork> I would too
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: Nice.
<Dovah> tSparx: I cant yet :( or maybe thats a good thing :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> Agh!
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: Well, either AJIsAwesome isn't missing out (my opinion), or you are.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am so jelly. I really wanted that derpy AJIsAwesome =P
<tSparx> Dovah: Canna what?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Seeing your name reminds me
<Cypresswolf> Speaking of double shots - I owe a few people some drink recipes :)
<Dovah> tSparx: drink a gargle blaster
<MLP_Brovakiin> tSparx: There is a difference between steak & drugs :|
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: I'm sorry. I SERIOUSLY didn't know i would get it. :$
<SafariMonkey> Do we have anything more specific than this? http://cheezburger.com/6568126464
<DashWithRainbows> killerpony7733 Ah, didn'tknow you would have that small of a space. I only have my own room since my bro moved out, so that's where the desktop is going to be. I can always hook up my TV screen to serve as an 2 screen for it.
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: I NEVER win ANY raffles. :$
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: Steak? I thought you were talking about drinking, kind sir, nvm!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its cool. Your just really lucky. Its better that it is going to a Brony.
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: Hahaha
<Barbetos|AtWork> bronystater
<Barbetos|AtWork> I got a coloring book at least lol
<MLP_Brovakiin> tSparx: Haha derp :P
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: Thanks. It's kind of nice to win something everyonce in a while.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I got the Midnight magic people, Rina-chan, a few of the con people, Cypresswolf, MysteryBen to sign it.
<Cypresswolf> I got some emails to write :D The looks I got from some I shared my pony drink book - They had no idea drink recipes were ponified at all
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: Nice! :O
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Friendship is Magic Season 1 DVD Pre-orders hit #3 on Amazon
<tSparx> SafariMonkey: We can't even be sure that's legit -- really easy to put the Hasbro logo on something and post it up.
<SafariMonkey> Anyone?
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: How could they not know? :D
<Polydunami> How did I see the tweet before this post?
<tSparx> SafariMonkey: I will hear from the mouth of Hub or Hasbro, and no one else.
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows The living room is just next to this door frame and the bathroom and other bedroom is just about the same away too. and the kitchen yeah everything is so tight that the living room can be reached by just the few steps
<SafariMonkey> tSparx: yeah I know
<shibaru> Hi
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows It gets really bad when we argue here at how we use the space and how everyone doesn't get enough space do this and that...
<DashWithRainbows> Ouch, that is a small apartment killerpony7733. That seems something I'd like if I lived by myself.
<Cypresswolf> AJIsAwesome: I started searching when I first heard about the pony drinking game - first found 6 for the mane 6, then found ones for Spike, Trixie, & Vinyl Scratch....and the list kept growing
<Litwick> Hello again guys ^^
<tSparx> SafariMonkey: We'll know when we know, and trust me, you'll know when we know, because that's all we'll talk about all day. Every time someone logs on, "Hi SafariMonkey, did you hear we have the release date!?"
<AJIsAwesome> Litwick: Hi! :)
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Yeah something like that. But three family members along with me and having little to no privacy is annoying as heck...
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Litwick :)
<DashWithRainbows> I would guess so.
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows It kinda prevents me from talking with friends on skype or something along those lines i get no use of my headset due to this~
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: The Spike one's probably the only one I haven't heard of before.
<Hipster-Pony> lol
<Applejack2012> hi
<DashWithRainbows> We did have it at some point where we had 2 families living in this house.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Applejack2012
<DashWithRainbows> Not mention 3 of them were small kids.
<DashWithRainbows> And I really hate kids.
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Cypresswolf> The most difficult one I found is called a Sonic Rainboom - a giant jello shooter that takes 6+ hours to make - you have to refridgerate after each layer to get the rainbow look
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Wow. :O
<cachi01|phone> Hi everypony :)
<Applejack2012> hi
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: Hello! :)
<Cypresswolf> Never tried making one myself - though I'd like to try it, its not worth making a single one - its more for parties
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello cachi01|phone :)
<Panda|LOL> If you hate kids, start a sweat shop, that'll show em.
<thelonepony> hi cachi01|phone
<MLP_Brovakiin> Panda|LOL: LOL :D
<Litwick> Oh my god Panda XD
<Panda|LOL> ^^
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Mines three adults and me being the almost adult too. But yeah the size here gets to us at times cause we end up with arguements and bark at each other cause the size and all of it that kinda makes things diffucult at times
<thelonepony> Panda|LOL XD

<Everlasting_Joy> Freefall29: I don't think there is one.
<thelonepony> yes >_>
<Applejack2012> stream just died tonight
<Freefall29> ok good. ad block plus didn't block the stream. :)
<Moopy> hey guys you know the cans i was talking about i cleaned out my computer desk
<MrsTough> How is everyone?
<cachi01|muffin> What are you talking about.guys? Wrek is streaming the HL3 demo >_>
<Freefall29> speaking of half-life, black mesa comes out this week. thursday I think
<Everlasting_Joy> cachi01|muffin: Well played :).
<Freefall29> it comes out in 3 days
<cachi01|muffin> Freefall its going.to be so awesome
<Moopy> So there is a stream going on?
<Meanwhile> I should play Half Life at some point.
<MASF123> I thought the Black Mesa mod was out
<Meanwhile> I should. But I never will.
<Moopy> i need to refresh
<Freefall29> Meanwhile: you really should, its awesome
<Meanwhile> I'm sure it is but I really don't care.
<flutter_spin> Hey Sumica
<Moopy> i guess not then
<flutter_spin> Hey Wrek
<cachi01|muffin> Moopy theres a HL3 stream
<cachi01|muffin> Demo
<Shizuka> 13i discovered Half Life Source is too old a version of source to do fullscreen noborder which is laaaame
<Meanwhile> Trolling is against the rules cachi.
*cachi01|muffin hides
<Moopy> im a big fan of halo dude
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: It is?
*Bronysith puts Freefall29 in a full nelson
<cachi01|muffin> /)_=
<Freefall29> Moopy: do you have half-life 2 or another source engine game?
<Moopy> i have most all the games dude
<flutter_spin> I tried to replicate Sumica in blind bag form: http://flutterspin.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5edy50 How'd I do?
<Meanwhile> He probably doesn't even know what you just said.
<Panda|LOL> Shizuka, really? O_o I thought you could fullscreen HL
<Freefall29> Moopy: well you can get black mesa, its a remake of half-life and its free.
<Panda|LOL> Moopy!!!!
<Shizuka> 13fullscreen noborder is a different thing
<Panda|LOL> oh.
<cachi01|muffin> all the source engine games? Yeah sure
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Waiting Games / Dash's Insanity / Mountain Monologue Part 3
<Moopy> is it only for PC's
<cachi01|muffin> yes
<Moopy> then i don't have it
<Freefall29> I think its supposed to work on mac.
<Shizuka> 13rather than fullscreen, which hijacks the GPU threads for that entire screen (leading to flashes as you alt tab in or out), it's a window exactly as big as your monitor, and without the titlebar or border controls
<cachi01|muffin> How can you have all source engines.and all half life.games if you dont have the PC ones?
<Moopy> well i have a sony compaq valo computer system
<Brad[Laptop]> Im going to try making a 4x normal scale rainbow dash in plastic
<flutter_spin> SuperBrony63: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zbGFGQTq0&feature=player_embedded Are you seeing this?
<Bronysith> cachi01|muffin: attention whore
<Shizuka> 13so looks no different from fullscreen at native resolution, except you can alt-tab fluently as though it were any other window
<Freefall29> Moopy: ok nvm then. the offical website says it atm only supports windows. sorry
<Meanwhile> Is it me or is chat terribly pointless today?
<Moopy> its all good dude
*Bronysith puts Freefall29 in a full nelson
<Shizuka> 13one downside is vista and up use a full time desktop compositing method that renders your desktop similar to how dedicated graphics programs do, so there's some extra overhead of the compisitor having to incorporate the game window, rather than the game having full control
*Freefall29 begs for mercy
<flutter_spin> Meanwhile: it isn't time for fun yet
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: We just haven't found a good topic to discuss yet.
*alexxm puts Freefall29 in a figure 4 leglock as well
<Shizuka> 13but if you have a card that supports source well in the first place, the problem is pretty much nonexistent
<Moopy> Heh dat big shizuka mod talk
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: we are talking about half-life and ponies. that's pretty awesome to me
<Bronysith> http://www.dorkly.com/comic/39493/the-most-beautiful-thing-in-the-world FUCK YES

<Ryunosuke> valve will burn before EA buys it
*Bronysith goes into cachi01|muffin s r34 file
<Shizuka> 13gaben's already gone on record today saying he'd see valve disintegrate first than be swallowed up by a bigger company
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Ryunosuke
<Bronysith> OH GOD WHY
<HoodyNinja> Ryunosuke: Hello~
<cachi01|muffin> TOLD YA
<Shizuka> 13that and there's a report from a securities firm that valve is worth closer to $2.5bil
<Meanwhile> Because it looks like an evil version of the one you currently use?
<cachi01|muffin> Worth the weight
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that and it's paintable
<flutter_spin> Bronysith: You think I'm going to write fanfics without some action figures to play out the scenes?
<HoodyNinja> dat worth
<Meanwhile> Awesome.
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: what scenes? one of my OCs walking into his r34 thing?
<flutter_spin> lol
<Ryunosuke> well valve provides a unique service to the gaming industry, one that others try to emulate, but fail at (EA I AM LOOKING AT YOU)
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: Given Activision or EA would swallow Valve up, that's probably a good thing, that Valve would go down first.

<alexxm> yeah Michael
<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I must depart. It's DINNER time!
<AJIsAwesome> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI4ZOT63MGc&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
<AJIsAwesome> Everlasting_Joy: Bye! :)
<BladedWings> bye Everlasting_Joy
<alexxm> bye Everlastin_Joy
<Michael> bye Everlasting_Joy
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: never played skyward sword. is it good?
<cachi01|muffin> Oh Boy im so hungry i can eat an Everlasting_Joy!
<Michael> sweet music for my ears :D
<shibaru> She is ALWAYS wearing a long skirt. it freaks me out o_o
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: Some people are biased. I LOVE the game, while some people think it's bad.
*alexxm turns Michael into a robot and unleashes him on bronystate
<Cades> gen needs to get the fuck out of there asap :P
<AJIsAwesome> Some of the game mechanics may get a little annoying, but overall it's a terrific game, IMO.
<Michael> kill.crush.destroy.swag
*MLP_Brovakiin EMPs Michael
<shibaru> Yea, except her mom doesn't want her to move out EVER and has guardianship oiver her BECAUSE SHE SAID SO
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: We actually did that at BFF. :D
<shibaru> brb food
<Cades> is she over 18?
<Cades> ok
<shibaru> Yea
<Cades> then legally she can leave right now
<Cades> if she wants
<Michael> lol
<alexxm> oh yeah did you have fun there AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: I had a GREAT time. Still tired from it, too. :$
<Cades> im pretty sure
<Bronysith> cachi01|muffin: he thinks being able to kill everyone in games is wrong, like children or important quest givers and it should always be banned, the moment you are unable to kill something ruins immersion, ergo he is a false gamer for not wanting emersion in a game
<alexxm> AJIsAwesome so what happened there
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTt2JOULXg
<Bronysith> immersion
<Freefall29> Bronysith: I just don't get how killing adults is A-OK but killing children or animals is cruel and horrible.
<cachi01|muffin> Bronysith BEING ABLE TO KILL EVERYONE IS AWESOME!
<God_The_Atheist> yeah thats discriminatory
<Bronysith> cachi01|muffin: thats why i love fallout 1 and 2
<Bronysith> still need to play 2
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: A LOT. There was many things to buy, including badges and other merchandise. I'm thinking of making a DeviantArt account and posting pictures of the stuff I got there.
<God_The_Atheist> if killing adults is ok then so should killing children and animals
<cachi01|muffin> Freefall29 its a videogame who da fuk cares who you kill?
<God_The_Atheist> ive meet some really evil children in my life
<thelonepony> ^
<Michael> yeah, i wanted to kill some kids on skyrim but the game dont let me :[[
<cachi01|muffin> ^
<Freefall29> cachi01|muffin: umm.... I know that. I was backing up bronysith. I just don't get why there is a double standard that's all.
<God_The_Atheist> i dowloaded the killable children mod 4 sjyrim
<Freefall29> Michael: i'm sure a mod for that exists
<Bronysith> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/10/ywGXBSzcn020p7VbDTTJSw2.jpg the answer to why none of us can kill kids nowadays in games
<MLP_Brovakiin> Michael: You worry me sometimes...
<Bronysith> God_The_Atheist: doesnt count though
<Michael> yeah Freefall29
<cachi01|muffin> GODDAMIT SOCCER MOMS
<Michael> MLP_Brovakiin: some of the kids are very annoying
<Dovah> Michael: you cant kill them but you can launch them a few hundred feet in the air, no mods
<Freefall29> Bronysith: and the government, don't forget with all that FCC and decency crap
<Shizuka> 13what are we flame warring over today?
<alexxm> Bronysith why can't we just kill the soccer mums
<God_The_Atheist> fucking soccer moms need to get the fuck over it
<Freefall29> then again. soccer moms run the government so duh
<MLP_Brovakiin> Michael: Good point, like that Braith areshole kid from Whiterun
<God_The_Atheist> i hate government and corperations
<alexxm> we need a V
<Bobeh> Hi BronyState.
<Michael> MLP_Brovakiin: for example
<alexxm> how are things Bobeh
<Michael> ohai Bobeh
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Bobeh
<thelonepony> hi Bobeh
<Freefall29> God_The_Atheist: corporations make the awesome games we love. so they're not all bad. just a few bad apples that spoiled the rest is all.
<Bobeh> alexxm: Gooooooood
<Bronysith> d
<alexxm> why don't we let anonymous run the goverment
<Shizuka> 13In this thread, discussing issues bigger than you are under the auspices of having an understanding of the whole
<cachi01|muffin> NO WTF NO NONONONONO WTF NO WHYYYYY
<Bronysith> *cough EA cough*
<Freefall29> alexxm: we all would die
<Bronysith> alexxm: cause they are anarchist?
<cachi01|muffin> GODDAMIT XBOX 360 S
<alexxm> Freefall29 why would happen
<MLP_Brovakiin> cachi01|muffin: what?
<Bronysith> ugh
<alexxm> and Bronysith whats the worst that happen
<God_The_Atheist> corperations only exist to make profit in whatever way possible
<Bronysith> i still need to play fallout 2
<Shizuka> 13um duh?
<Freefall29> alexxm: i've seen scary things from them. they can be very, very mean when they wanna be.
<Shizuka> 13hey bronystate let's play a game
<Shizuka> 13if you could ban all corporate profits, would you?
<cachi01|muffin> MLP_Brovakiin i accidentaly touched the goddamn sensible to touch the open disk button.
<Freefall29> Shizuka: no. then valve doesn't get all their hard earned cash.
<God_The_Atheist> id ban profit itself corprate and otherwise
<alexxm> Freefall29 so that would be an effective crime dettermet right?
<Bobeh> I HAVE NO PART IN THIS CONVERSATION
<Dovah> no then they woulnd have funding to make better games
<cachi01|muffin> dammit Bobeh
<Bronysith> nothingtodohere.jpg
<MLP_Brovakiin> cachi01|muffin: Haha I still have the old black xbox :P
<Bronysith> I WAS TALKING ABOUT IMMERSION IN A GAME
<Freefall29> alexxm: they do a lot of stuff for lulz man.
<Aryd> Theres bound to be some unforseen consequence to such a thing so i would not.
*Michael dont know what to do
<Bronysith> not about stupid corporation bullshit
<Shizuka> 13Congratulations God_The_Atheist, you haven't the most basic understanding of economics and have disqualified yourself from discussing them!
<Shizuka> 13Have a nice day.
<Unnr|AFK> Shizuka: =.(\
*Spectrum_Rush that feel when you tab back to chat and want to tab out again
<alexxm> Freefall29 i thought that was why they did everything
<Freefall29> alexxm: look. its just a bad idea a super effective trolling organization run a system that has power over a nation and other nations.
<God_The_Atheist> we wernt even talking about economics genuis we were talking about killable children in videogames
<Bobeh> Spectrum_Rush: I would do that, but I've got nothing to tab out to.
<alexxm> thats why i suggested it Freefall29
<Freefall29> God_The_Atheist: yeah. then you started talking about hating coprorations and wanting to ban all profits.
<God_The_Atheist> yes then i did but origonally we were talking about killing children
<cachi01|muffin> I loved when i blew up megaton in Fallout3
<Freefall29> alexxm: oh. lol right. nvm
<Bobeh> Aaaaaand now he's insulted an admin. RUN MAN
<Freefall29> Bobeh: who
<Shizuka> 13when in doubt, drop a grenade and trust the user is stupid enough to set it off, then wander off for dinner
<Shizuka> 13\o
<PillowPoni|Phone> Bobeh: run for the hills!
<MLP_Brovakiin> I'm gonna go to bed now, considering the fact that I slept through my alarm this morning :P
<Moopy> Hey guys im back and i saw the house burned

<Michael> hugs <3
<Bobeh> I bloke it.
<PillowPoni|Phone> Night MLP_Brovakiin
<Freefall29> God_The_Atheist: profit is the money a company gets back from paying for production of a product and service. they use it to keep doing what they do.
*BladedWings is hugged
<thelonepony> jinx :D
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<Moopy> yeah the house the gareage was melted the roof top was gane the windows was busted everything was gone
<AJIsAwesome> GilDash: Night! :)

<cachi01|muffin> BRB playing Deadlight i bought it a month ago and i havent played it yet lol
<Bobeh> Good night GilDash
<cachi01|muffin> Night GilDash
<AJIsAwesome> Moopy: Woah. How did it all happen?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so just throw a grenade and hope for the best ?
<Michael> Gnight GilDash
<PillowPoni|Phone> Hey otakon
<Michael> ohai otakon
<otakon> hiya guys
<AJIsAwesome> ohai otakon. :)
<otakon> what's up?
<Freefall29> otakon: sup
<alexxm> Moopy how did the fire start
<thelonepony> hi otakon
<God_The_Atheist> the company could just do what they do to provide to the soceity because if they dont then theyll lose there jobs and no longer be able to benifit from the other goods and services produced by the society ( theoretically)
<Moopy> Well it hannped yesterday when my mom and my step dad went to work they saw it on the news that morning when i was sleeping
<Bobeh> My Brother is downstairs yelling at Super Smash Brothers.
<alexxm> how are things otakon
<otakon> hmmm
<otakon> okay I guess
<otakon> brb
<AJIsAwesome> Bobeh: Which one?
<Moopy> I didn't se the fire at all it was just burned untill my mom took me over there and saw the whole thing
<Bobeh> AJIsAwesome: Brawl.
<AJIsAwesome> Bobeh: Okay.
<AJIsAwesome> I prefer Melee over Brawl, though.
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: yeah. melee is better
<AJIsAwesome> Moopy: This was a nearby house?
<Bobeh> AJIsAwesome: BY THE WAY. I LIKE YOUR NAME. Hard to find an Applejack fan.
<Moopy> Cause alot of people were outside talking about it and i was crazy as hell
<AJIsAwesome> Bobeh: Thanks. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/SoHeWgLvlXI This i samazing
<CrimsonPhoenix> is**
<Moopy> No it wasn't a nearby house it was on the other side of the nieghborhood over here in Willmingtion
<Bobeh> Freefall29: I like Brawl more. Just because Melee feels really tight or controlled. In brawl you can jump around and not get dragged down to the floor right away.
<shibaru> Her mom apparently has guardianship over her so....
<Moopy> and i saw the dresser was burned to as well
<shibaru> Which makes absolutely no sense
<Bobeh> And when I got back, the DNA evidence was gone.
<AJIsAwesome> Bobeh: True, but the characters are floaty and the sound effects are par at best.
<Freefall29> Bobeh: I just felt the SSE was boring and nothing was explained, online is pure crap, more clones, and make a stage feature is too basic for making anything creative. that's just me.
<Rustymeat> WHY NO STREAM?
<AJIsAwesome> You really don't feel that "oomph" in Brawl than in Melee. You feel like you dealt a bone-shatering SMASH, and it feels gratifying.
<Michael> Rustymeat: there's no need of stream to get fun on bronystate :)
<Freefall29> Michael: yeah. the chat is the fun for bronystate.
<SpeedyBolt> Are we all talking about how Melee is better than Brawl?
<Michael> IKR
<Freefall29> SpeedyBolt: yeah. brawl is fun with friends but they messed up some stuff in it.
<Michael> also without stream u can post vid links :$
<AJIsAwesome> One of my favorite SFX in Melee is Mario's meteor smash. The SFX he makes when it connects is SO satisfying.
<Moopy> Me and my mom didn't go nike riding it was to late over here and its like 7:15pm over here
<AJIsAwesome> I like Brawl, it's a great game, but I would prefer Melle IMO.
<Moopy> i mean bike
<AJIsAwesome> *Melee*
<SpeedyBolt> I miss my fast-paced Melee
<AJIsAwesome> Are online matches still available on Brawl?
<Freefall29> I really don't like modern nintendo. these days they are making more spin off titles that took little effort to make rather then the main series. they just slap mario on another tennis game. lazy
<AJIsAwesome> If the LAN device for Gamecube was compatible for Melee, lots of people would STILL be playing it today.
<Bobeh> Freefall29: Subspace Emissary was awful. But it had pretty cutscenes. I don't do much of online, mostly because it gets my brother so mad that I think it may be dangerous to play. I dunno about the clones thing. in Melee you had Pikachu and Pichu, Dr. Mario, Luigi, and Mario, and Ganondorf and Captainb Falcon. NOBODY REALLY USES THE STAGE BUILDER SO PRETEND IT DOESN'T EXIST.
<SpeedyBolt> The Subspace Emissary was...
<Hipster-Pony> hi
<Moopy> thats some big words you got there
<SpeedyBolt> Okay.
<Hipster-Pony> :P
<SpeedyBolt> They still never explained how the Halberd got taken over at the beginning.
<thelonepony> hi Hipster-Pony
<Freefall29> Bobeh: subspace emissary had nothing to explain whats going on. if you wanna get an epic plot, you gotta explain. the reason why mario can get away with zero plot is because they don't try to make it epic.
<Michael> ohai Hipster-Pony
<Hipster-Pony> thelonepony: hi
<Bobeh> SpeedyBolt: I didn't have alot of fun running through an area then having to stay in one place and kill 50 enimies.
<Hipster-Pony> Michael: hi
<Hipster-Pony> are we waiting to watch something?
<SpeedyBolt> It's pretty damn easy.
<Freefall29> Hipster-Pony: we are playing the waiting game....
<AJIsAwesome> IMO, the floating island would've been great backstory for Sonic. But nope. He arrives at the VERY LAST moment out of nowhere.
<SpeedyBolt> ...That WAS never explained, really.
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: that ticked me off a bit. it ticked me off more he just attacks the main villian, knowing nothing about whats going on
<Hipster-Pony> Freefall29: lol
<Hipster-Pony> :P
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: Yep. Me too.
<Bobeh> AJIsAwesome: I thought the part where sonic jumped in was pretty damn cool.
<SpeedyBolt> I mean, we go through all of this shit
<AJIsAwesome> Bobeh: Me too. I just wished they explained how.
<SpeedyBolt> and then suddenly, RIGHT THERE, Sonic out of nowhere.
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: I liked how they gave lucas some screen time, despite that they didn't release mother 3 in america. thats trolling mother fans right there.
<SpeedyBolt> They did give Lucas some screentime, yeah.
<Michael> http://derpy.me/n1npH LMAO
<SpeedyBolt> But they reverted him back to this Pre-Chapter 4 Attitude.
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: Oh DEFINITELY. I wished Earthbound selled more here. :(

<Bobeh> AJIsAwesome: Sonic was going fast, because he had to. But he went too fast and ended up in the nintendo universe. He was going too fast to stop and he ran into Taboo's Wings Of Death. Make sense?
<AJIsAwesome> Bobeh: Yep. :P
<Moopy> Guys im scared here my step dad is argueing my mom and i hate that
<pony_6355> i thought sonic went so fast that he flew into the sun
<Freefall29> Bobeh: that would technically be a plot and brawl can't have any of that.
<SpeedyBolt> It had a plot, Freefall29
<CrimsonPhoenix> Michael, funny how I have this game somewhere
<Freefall29> SpeedyBolt: :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> never really played it though
<SpeedyBolt> A very unexplained one..but..
<Bobeh> Freefall29: It's a fighter. Nobody plays fighters fo a plot.
<Bobeh> Freefall29: They play fighters to fight.
<SpeedyBolt> I'm wondering here
<SpeedyBolt> Would the SSE have been better with voices?
<Hipster-Pony> Moopy: it's ok...everything will be ok
<Freefall29> Bobeh: yeah. but atleast fighting games like mortal kombat EXPLAIN what the hell is going on.
<AJIsAwesome> SpeedyBolt: Nah. Not for me.
<otakon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zbGFGQTq0
<otakon> WATCH THAT AND LOVE IT!
<AJIsAwesome> SpeedyBolt: I'm glad they were able to make a story without them talking.
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, I already did
<SpeedyBolt> I personally cant imagine how they'd screw up some of the voices.
<Bobeh> otakon: Saw that earlier. BEST THING EVER
<Cades> Maybe in the states it's 21
<thelonepony> ^
<Freefall29> SpeedyBolt: voices would'nt be needed. they could have just done text screens. again, lazy
<otakon> dammit I'm late
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I LOVED the DJ Mystery bit. :D
<SpeedyBolt> DOUBLE EATER!
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, now watch this and be intrigued http://youtu.be/SoHeWgLvlXI
<otakon> Pinkie's bit is my favorite
<otakon> saw it CrimsonPhoenix
<otakon> damn you know who I haven't seen in awhile?
<otakon> CriticKitten
<Michael> otakon: dat franky
<SpeedyBolt> I'm gonna close this chat for a bit
<SpeedyBolt> About to knock the crap out of Acid Ace
<otakon> Michael: agreed...SUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPER!
<thelonepony> SUPERRR Franky!!
<cachi01|muffin> I love how most of deadlights achievements are references to some.guns & roses songs :)
<Moopy> *Moopy gets a little shaked from his parents argueing each other*

<Bronysith> Michael: one piece?
<Moopy> i think i feel cool now thanks dude
<Michael> yeah Bronysith
<Freefall29> never got into one piece
<Kinixys> Imma fan!
*alexxm kidnaps thelonepony
<Cades> It looks like she can leave if she's 18. Her mom's full of shit.
<Hipster-Pony> My Little BronyState: Waiting Is Magic
<Brad[Laptop]> SuperBrony63 good to hear madmax made $400 for repairs!
<Michael> *buffer is magic*
<thelonepony> damn it why does it have to be me!
<alexxm> thelonepony no idea
<Hipster-Pony> >_> I love waiting <_<
<Freefall29> the waiting game sucks, i'm gonna play hungry, hungry hippos
<Moopy> yeah me to i love waiting
*Bronysith feeds Freefall29 to the hippos
<Kinixys> I'm listening to Dr Whooves and Assistant.
<thelonepony> let's play the quiet game :)
<otakon> Fluttershy is the champ
<otakon> we cannot beat her
<Moopy> My little waiting is cool
<otakon> it is useless to try
<Michael> ^
<EspyLacopa> Fluttershy is the staremaster.
*alexxm shows thelonepony his duct tape collection "if you insist"
<Meanwhile> Fluttershy is a dull dull pony.
<Hipster-Pony> QUIET GAME
<Michael> one does not simply beat fluttershy
<Michael> int the quiet game
<thelonepony> *mmmmmmm*
<Moopy> Derpy is the funniest pony ever
<Meanwhile> One can however beat Fluttershy with a stick fairly easily.
<Michael> dat is cheat
<LunarRepublicGuard> *zzzzzz*
<alexxm> bad Meanwhile
<Freefall29> Meanwhile: you could beat fluttershy with a twig
<Meanwhile> Or a rolled up newspaper.
<alexxm> so how are things thelonepony
<Kinixys> Michael: I rather like One Piece. Friendship seems to be the over-arcing theme.
<Freefall29> Meanwhile: or if you just yell at her loud enough, she might end up hurting herself
<thelonepony> great alexxm and you?
<Michael> Kinixys: yeah, i'm a big fan too
<Kandarihu> Kinixys, indeed it is.
<alexxm> i'm good thelonepony sorry about the whole kidnaping thing
<shibaru> Her mom doesn't let her make her own decisions on anything. Gen did not have to continue going to school, she didn't want to, her mom forced her
<Freefall29> alexxm: i thought you attacked thelonepony, not kidnap
<Michael> Kinixys: also the plot is very catchy
<alexxm> er what Freefall29 why would i do that
<thelonepony> well i would of bein bleeding to death right now...

<PillowPoni|Phone> Oh, hello Slenderman.
<Slenderman> LunarRepublicGuard: You do realize the only Republic died with Rome? It's a pathetic government home to dictator like Ceaser.
<Kandarihu> I find it convenient that all these zombies are dressed in grey.
<Shizuka> 13sec
<Meanwhile> You just have to walk up to them and unload a shotgun into their back.
<otakon1> aha
<otakon1> CONDITIONS
<otakon1> you have to shoot her in the back of the head
<Shizuka> 13except shizu doesn't have shotgun :3
<otakon1> at point blank range
<Shizuka> 13you just headshot

<PillowPoni|Phone> Only problem being I only get sisters computer when she's at work

<Canadian_Brony|TF2> hello everypony
<DashWithRainbows> Anyways, TF2
*PillowPoni|Phone prefers Soldier and Engie
<Freefall29> wish I knew the server password
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: ya know that your name only appears as Shizuka on steam right now, searching for kamishizuka usually wont result in the correct person...
<LadyCanary> Go Shizu :3 I wubs you
<Kandarihu> Suffice to say, I was fed up with PSO2's use of Gameguard, so I finally sent in that e-mail complaining about GG. But since it has to be in Japanese, I used Google Translate. And I had to reword it a lot in order to try to get Google Translate to translate it to Japanese they'd understand.
<otakon1> lol
<Saturn> 08,01aaaand im back in scotland :(
<Shizuka> 13anypony recognize the ost yet

<DashWithRainbows> Scoot-Scootaloo I got one I don't use.
<Kandarihu> AND I asked them to drop Gameguard altogether and hire the hackers who are screwing up the game instead.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Scoot-Scootaloo related http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/339
<DashWithRainbows> Scrap is made by smelting weapons down
<otakon1> Saturn: a'www that sucks man, but good to see you back
<DashWithRainbows> And is used to craft and trade for weapons.
<LadyCanary> :D Saturn!
<Nittany_Discord> I only have the rainblower and normal flamethrower.
<Canadian_Brony|TF2> Scoot-Scootaloo any regular item is worth one scrap, but I'll check your load-out and see if there's anything I like. Steam name?
<DashWithRainbows> 3 scrap = 1 reclaimed. 3 reclaimed = 1 refined.
<LadyCanary> Y so lonely, Saturn? :(

<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: ill try that
<Canadian_Brony|TF2> Scoot-Scootaloo I sent you a friend request, so message me to trade when you get the chance. Also, don't get rid of your tradable Solemn Vow. I'll take that for a Backburner.
<Freefall29> I'm gonna stay in chat, but if anypony needs me. I'm gonna be using the source sdk
<Bronysith> hey Freefall29
<Freefall29> hey Bronysith....
<Unnr> Saturn: Use a blacklight to find stains, then a mix of about 1/2 vinegar to 1/2 warm water
<Barbetos> Hellooooo
<Unnr> if smell still persists, sprinkle some baking soda on the area while damp
<Obsidian> Hello Barbetos
<Freefall29> sup barbetos
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: did somepony say sprinkle!
<LunarRepublicGuard> hi Barbetos
<Unnr> if still nasty, you can try mixing a few drops of dish soap with about a 1/2 cup of Hydrogen peroxide
<Cypresswolf> Hello Barbetos
<Cypresswolf> Hello MrMalk
<NullRadix> and remember, if all else fails, fire is probably the answer
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos: Hello! :)
<AJIsAwesome> MrMalk: Hi! :)
<MrMalk> Sup guys
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: That would be bad in this occasion...
<Unnr> O_o
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: he broke again!!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: about to serve for title with a double breaaak
<Unnr> Yeah, but Djokovic just had to call a trainer over
<Unnr> this could be bad
<Nittany_Discord> Shizuka got an extra flamethrower!
<twilight_sprinkle> omfg a medical timeout
<twilight_sprinkle> djokovic you cheating prick
<Unnr> Listen to that crowd twilight_sprinkle
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: ikr
<Unnr> :3
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: his sounds excititng, ithink ill put it on and cath the end
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: the crowd really made this match amazng tbh, the play isnt that great
<Nittany_Discord> Aww. I was going to ask for that Degreaser.
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: Murray's play is so much more interesting on grass
<otakon1> brb restroom
<twilight_sprinkle> dammit Andy siddown and take a break
<otakon1> Shizuka: good luck
<Unnr> Go ballboy, grab that towel!~
<Obsidian> cool music
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: depends on his choice. when playing Federer he made the mistake of chasing every ball own and he ended up getting tired in the 4th
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: he shouldve been more atacking in the first two sets of this match imo
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: True, but his play is much more dynamic and he tended to have less predictable volley, he has been getting wayy to set in a pattern with his returns
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: Let This Be The End / Keep Faith / Fluttershy ft. Lolikko
<VenHur> KILL IT WITH FI-YAH!

<VenHur> FI-YAAAH!
<Unnr> Annnn serving for the championship
<twilight_sprinkle> 15-0
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: True enough, but I think he was trying to avoid the whole getting burned out early problem
<Unnr> much to his disadvantage
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: attackign game takes waaaaay less than all the defending he has done
<twilight_sprinkle> pfffffffffffff

<AJIsAwesome> Snowflake: Chill on the caps.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: Great even though today was not a productive day at work. Im just in a good mood all around :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: Andy will probably play a lot better from now on, confidence-wise
<LunarRepublicGuard> oni_link: just being on guard duty
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: True, being validated with a championship is a huge confidence booster
<oni_link> LunarRepublicGuard: hows guard duty? lol you didnt fall asleep on firewatch did you?
<LunarRepublicGuard> >_> no
<Kandarihu> I swear. SWAG.MOV is probably the only PONY.MOV that I'm genuinely looking forward to. I really don't care for this series' style of humor, but I'm really curious how it's going to end.
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: funny how Lendl never smiles :P
<oni_link> LunarRepublicGuard: its okay if you did :P haha
<LunarRepublicGuard> :)
<oni_link> Kandarihu: I liked em all, they got incrementally better as they came along IMO. and thats why Im here now :D
<superretroworld> i found those .MOV videos so offensive
<RoboGerbil> crush kill destroy swag
<Freefall29> superretroworld: in what way
<AJIsAwesome> I liked most of them, but the one I can't really stand to watch again is Party.mov.
<Moopy> Heh the egineer thinks trixe is best pony pfft please Rainbow Dash is the best pony
<Kandarihu> oni_link, you do understand the actual screenings of those videos, besides APPLE.MOV and SPIKE.MOV are not allowed here, right?
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: Srs business
<Freefall29> I just can't wait for swag.mov
<shibaru> I HAVE FIVE CURES RUNNING AROUND MY HOUSE!!!
<Moopy> whats that thing at the botton right there with those 3 different colors there?
<oni_link> Kandarihu: I do. And the thing for me was that I watched them before I gave the show a try. And now I genuinely like the show and its thanks to that series and YTPs
<Nittany_Discord> APPLE.MOV and SPIKE.MOV are fine here. The rest are questionable to flat-out censored.
<shibaru> ERRR... SIX!!! WHEN DID THE SIXTH ONE HAPPEN???
<Kandarihu> oni_link, I see.
<superretroworld> Freefall29: well think about it, they all hate each other, raritys fat, pinkies an alchololic, and they changed fluttershys face
<VenHur> KILL IT WITH FI-YAAAAAH!
<cachi01|muffin> Swag.mov will end with everyone being killed I think
<Freefall29> superretroworld: she was different in apple.mov
<MASF123> I dislike the .MOV series, but I won't ruin it for peho like it.ople w
<MASF123> people who like it
<twilight_sprinkle> and then the stream was over :<
<oni_link> youre a good person MASF123 :P
<Nittany_Discord> SWAG.MOV might tie in the Tumblr series Ask Jappleack.
<MrMalk> Cypresswolf Barbetos AJIsAwesome you guys here?
<MASF123> Sorry keyboard buttons get stuck.
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: its still going on though
<Cypresswolf> MrMalk: I am
<cachi01|muffin> Nittany_Discord maybe
<oni_link> Nittany_Discord: I think ultimately thats whats gonna happen
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: the one on the USO site?
<AJIsAwesome> I liked the first two, Shed.MOV was okay, and I hated Party.MOV
<AJIsAwesome> MrMalk: Yep.
<Unnr> yah
<LunarRepublicGuard> so why is their robots attack?
<sub06905> this song <3
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: odd, mine says broadcast is over
<AJIsAwesome> Magic.MOV is okay, IMO.
<MASF123> oni_link, I wish I were a good person, or just pure hearted.
<lowfn> I'm back everypo- What the...
<Unnr> though right now its just showing pretty picutures of flags
<Vanacus> Is anyone here interested in editing a Borderlands crossover fic? :)
<Unnr> Annn there it ends

<MASF123> oni_link Society
<VenHur> Same.
<MASF123> They can be cruel
<Vanacus> MASF123 that NMM wouldn't also happen to be Dragryphon / Heat Wave of EFR?
<lowfn> Nittany_Discord: Should I start the sequel to Nittany Discord's first adventure?
<Moopy> im a korean
<twilight_sprinkle> Murray wins his first slam, and Djokovic stays away from Federer's records. goooood :3 although Djokovic still has a very long way to go
<oni_link> MASF123: its unfortunate but I give everyone a chance, if they mess that up then I stop being nice
<Kandarihu> I just remember coming out of Season 2 dreading nothing more than the effects the remaining 2 PONY.MOV videos would have on the community here. And then worse stuff started running on the stream.
<Snowflake> what is the link to this song plzzz
<Cades> haha
<Moopy> Heh your just like DJ PON3
<Canadian_Brony> I'm back, but only for a short while before I head out again.
<Obsidian> Well thats it for me tonight. Got a test tommorrow so goodnight everypony!
<Snowflake> link to song plz pm
<oni_link> night Obsidian good luck!
<Nittany_Discord> Dunno lowfn. I'm canning acting like a maid for a while for professionalism. May not be relevant.
<Canadian_Brony> g'ngiht Obsidian
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: btw i think the match was like 1 minute short of being the longest uso final ever
<superretroworld> Obsidian: good luck
<AJIsAwesome> Obsidian: NIght! :)
<thelonepony> night Obsidiam
<Kandarihu> And then PARTY.MOV came out, and THAT wasn't really a problem.
<shibaru> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma5vmrVNaA1rywedzo1_400.jpg
<MASF123> Vanacus, I think in Fimfiction his name is Dr. Phd Sparkle or something.
<NullRadix> rest well Obsidiam
<LunarRepublicGuard|A> night Obsidian
<shibaru> 8^3
<Snowflake> because iam french music right there
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: Not suprising there, they were playing hard at the end
<LadyCanary> I hear Buddy Holly
<Vanacus> MASF123 that's fine :)
<Cades> XD
<Snowflake> link to sonfg any one name of it?
<superretroworld> i noticed it tf2 only lags when more ppl are on
<shibaru> I'm just drinkin expresso like nothin's happening
<Canadian_Brony> superretroworld . . . yeah . . .
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: yeah and with baseline grinding it was. tbh it wasnt a good match until the last set, but the last set with atmosphere was amazing
<LunarRepublicGuard|A> wub wub wub wub wub
<lowfn> Nittany_Discord: All work and no maids makes Nttany a dull mod.
<oni_link> Lol I made a song in famitracker because of a 2 second sound from a pony YTP :D
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: So. Much. Baseline.
*Canadian_Brony slaps lowfn
<VenHur> They really need to fix that lag issue.
<Cades> lol
<Nittany_Discord> It makes Nittany an unemployed mod.
<superretroworld> Canadian_Brony: were you already in a mtach when i tried to invite you?
<AJIsAwesome> IMO, I found nothing really humorous in PARTY.MOV, most of it was disgusting to me. However, if you like it, more power to you.
*lowfn hides in corner away from Canadian_Brony
<Canadian_Brony> lowfn How dare you you refer to a mod as dull!
<Bronysith> GNIGHT EVERYPONY, see you tomorrow, for if i stay up too long, the Insomia gnomes will sodomize me
<Bronysith> *cough
<Nittany_Discord> I should say too many maids makes Nittany an unemployed mod.
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Night! :)
<Snowflake> what is the names of these songs?
<superretroworld> night Bronysith
<Nittany_Discord> Things in excess are bad.
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, I know the feeling. Good night.
<Moopy> Hey guys member the old gamecube console and member the starfox adventure games? i beated that game like a couple times it was pretty easy and kicked ass
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: ikr. 54 shot rallies.... Murray couldve attacked a lot more and saved some juices, but he won anyway so idk. Djokovic was playing badly, he was moving so poorly
<Freefall29> name of the song?
<VenHur> Bye Bronysith.
<Freefall29> bye bronysith
<Bronysith> Moopy: easy is boring
<Canadian_Brony> superretroworld idk, I was in one server that died, moved to another server, was invited to another by one of my friends, then my . . . everything died.
<Kandarihu> Freefall29, it's the audio for 1,000 people pressed the subscribe button by accident (paraphrased the name)
<Canadian_Brony> seeya bronys-
<Canadian_Brony> dammit
<Buytoast> ah, Starfox Adventures
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: too bad Federer didnt make it to the finals, i bet he wouldve bageled Novak again... also Roddick retired after this tournament :<
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Bye! :)
<Buytoast> what a strange game
<Moopy> well i had to play it it was fun an all
<Unnr> Roddick retired? Noooo
<Cades> lol I'm almost finished my first full tune :P
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome I was trying to say goodbye to Bronysith
<AJIsAwesome> Starfox Adventures: The unholy abomination of the Star Fox franchise.
<Canadian_Brony> but I was too slow
<Canadian_Brony> again
<Moopy> Hmp
<Buytoast> That was the first Gamecube game I played.
<superretroworld> Canadian_Brony: still having connection problems?
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: yeah, he was such a fun guy...
<Buytoast> Weird ass dinosaurs and shit
<cachi01|muffin> AjIsAwesome that fanfic?
<VenHur> Bronies versus Haters. FIGHT!
<cachi01|muffin> We already won
<superretroworld> Buytoast: tf2 is also a gamecube game?
<Moopy> i had 2 starfox games like starfox adventures and starfox assault
<Buytoast> no
<VenHur> And the red team of Bronies PREVAIL!
<Buytoast> what?
<Buytoast> i was talking about Starfox Adventures
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: Tennis geeking in #bronystate. Taking being nerdy to a new level.
<superretroworld> oh
<Canadian_Brony> superretroworld nah, that's another computer entirely. I'm borrowing a friend's which actually plays TF2, but then I think my dad started pissing with the switchbox.
<Nittany_Discord> One fandom leaks into another.
<Canadian_Brony> and when my father tampers with electricity, well . . .
<Nittany_Discord> Then you have tennis ponies.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm okay with them trying to change up the gameplsy style, but all they really did was copy paste LoZ's gameplay style and add crappy voice actors.
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: its a chat dedicated to a show about cartoon ponies, i dont think we can beat that :P
<VenHur> I had Starfox 64 and Adventures...
<Moopy> i had the starfox poster that was hanging on my wall
<Vanacus> Any Borderlands fans here? :)
<Canadian_Brony> somebody isn't going to be happy. Usually him
<superretroworld> oh
<Unnr> Nittany_Discord: Ponies of Tennis: The Musical?
<cachi01|muffin> First videogame i played was pacman. And then Super Mario sunshine and blue wave or however that watermotorcycles games was called lol
<Nittany_Discord> Yikes.
<EasyQuest> The Crystal Empire, Part 1 cannot wait.
<twilight_sprinkle> There was actually a tennis pony in mlp, i wonder who he was modeled after
<VenHur> Anyone remember the Nintendo Power video... Y'know, with the Mario doll...
<AJIsAwesome> I actually got Assualt and Adventures mixed up, unfortunately. :|
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: That sounds like a challenge...
<Kandarihu> cachi01|muffin, Wave Race
<Moopy> then i statred playing zoo cube
<cachi01|muffin> Wave race yeah :)
<VenHur> And espectialy: "THIS. is the Rumble Pak".
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: heh :P
<Canadian_Brony> the very first video game I played was either Super Mario World or Super Mario Kart.
<AJIsAwesome> Wave Race is a fun game, even though I could never win it. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> oi Saturn you here?
<EasyQuest> The Crystal Empire, Part 1
<cachi01|muffin> AjIsAwesome IKR
<VenHur> My brain melted upon the golden sounds of the Rumble Pak...
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: he just wandered off to bed.
<Canadian_Brony> This music reminds me of Super Paper Mario, but I'm not entirely sure why
<twilight_sprinkle> ah k
<Kandarihu> Wow, it's been so long, I can't remember the first video game I ever played. Maybe it was the orginal Super Mario Bros 1
<Unnr> First game I beat... Contra 2
<VenHur> A first for any systems.
<Unnr> That was *hard*
<Buytoast> ah yes, I love Contra
<Canadian_Brony> first game I beat . . . umm . . .

<Dovah> holy god parents know NOTHING about technology...
<cachi01|muffin> First game i beat was Luigis mansion lol i love that game
<Canadian_Brony> I guess you can't really "beat" Mario Kart: Double Dash, but I did get %100.
<cachi01|muffin> Unnr o_o
<Moopy> i miss my old gamecube console i should've brought it down to Willmingtion and played it
<Unnr> cachi01|muffin: I still get the theme for that game stuck in my head.
<Canadian_Brony> O___O
<Canadian_Brony> Double Dash
<shibaru> c:
<Canadian_Brony> why didn't I get it before?
<VenHur> The first game I beated...um, I don't know...I guess in my early childhood was um...Mickey and The Magical Mirror game...y'know, with that ghost...and finding the mirror pieces?
<cachi01|muffin> Unnr the theme of luigis mansion gave me.nightmares xd
<VenHur> Yeah, that game...
<Canadian_Brony> Mario Kart just got %20 cooler
<cachi01|muffin> Mario kart double dash <3

<Canadian_Brony> IKR?
<Canadian_Brony> I just made the connection
<Unnr> Lets see, first game I can remember playing was IT came from the desert.

<Unnr> On my dad's lap on the Amiga 2600

<Canadian_Brony> I have yet to play 64, GBA, and DS
<HoodyNinja> I dont know why i keep leaving this place

<Canadian_Brony> I have yet to use it
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: It is, I just played it in Japan first.
<Cades> it sucks :P
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: that was the namco one right?
<VenHur> Oh yeah, the arcade Mario Kart games...It has Pac-Man in those games, which, speaking of, might give Pac-Man a chance to appear in the next Smash Bros.
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: I think so
<superretroworld> has anybody hear heard about the creepy luna game?
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: Ive played them too , those things are awesome :)
<HoodyNinja> VenHur: That would suck
<Canadian_Brony> superretroworld no, and I dont' want to know
<oni_link> I wanna play the F-Zero cabinets :(
<VenHur> Well, I heard Namco Bandai is working on the project, so...yeah.
<Canadian_Brony> I wanna play a 64 game on a 64
<JRP> SuperBrony64:
<Canadian_Brony> one of the only Nintendo systems I have never played on
<Freefall29> n64 was awesome
<HoodyNinja> ^
<Canadian_Brony> and I <3 Nintendo
<oni_link> VenHur: Its always Nintendo firsthand though :o And Masahiro Sakurai
<Freefall29> not as good as the super ninendo. the super nintendo was a god
<Canadian_Brony> I went from SNES straight to Gamecube
<VenHur> *gaasp* You don't own a N64?! The granddaddy of ALL nostalgic games?!
<Canadian_Brony> nnope :(
<Nittany_Discord> N64 was the last Nintendo console I owned.
<Vanacus> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LXaHJ1po1V8OgcfJZsoMfAO1vLoB4w-wUY1kNIsa7n4/edit
<VenHur> ...I feel SO sorry for you.
<Moopy> my gamecube console color was purple
<Vanacus> Here's the fic I mentioned before, please comment to help me make corrections :)
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<oni_link> Honestly, I associate more with the NES and SNES even though the N64 was really "my generation"
<Nittany_Discord> And granddad? What nostalgic games?
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: so after 10-15 years you never bought another one?
<VenHur> N64 = Our childhood of the 90s.
<Nittany_Discord> Nope.
<Nittany_Discord> Went to the playstation and Xbox.
<Canadian_Brony> you tell me Nostalgic Games, I immediately think of Super Mario World
<shibaru> c:
<Canadian_Brony> gah
<Freefall29> the snes was superior.
<Cades> c:
<Canadian_Brony> took one look and never looked back
<HoodyNinja> Nittany_Discord: Mario party, oot and mm, super mario 64, clay fighter, need i go on?
<Cades> M:
<cachi01|muffin> N64 is best console
<VenHur> Don't forget Donkey Kong Country 1, 2, AND 3. Shit's awesome.
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: oh nintendo consoles, i thought you meant all consoles :D
<Cades> its a duck :P
<SpeedyBolt> I had Donkey Kong 64. Thank you very much.
<Freefall29> I mean, over sooo many games are said to be the greatest the industry has to offer.
<oni_link> As of now, there are wayyy more NES games I remember playing and keep playing whereas my N64 is just collecting dust.
<Moopy> Does anypony have a PSP?
<cachi01|muffin> i have a vita
<AJIsAwesome> Mario Party REALLY went downhill after 3, but 9 gave me hope in the series.
<Canadian_Brony> I have a DSi
<Cypresswolf> nostalgic games for me - Bucky O'Hare, Primal Rage, TMNT arcade
<SpeedyBolt> I miss it when games were actually LONG
<HoodyNinja> ^
<cachi01|muffin> AjIsAwesome.AFTER 4
<VenHur> Don't know why's DKC 3 is the least acclaimed of the bunch...It's kind of underlooked...
<Canadian_Brony> I miss it when they were challenging
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|muffin: True.
<Nittany_Discord> My future with consoles is uncertain. It's wait and see for me.
<Unnr> Cypresswolf: Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Wars for the win
<Freefall29> I've got a wii, nes, n64, playstation, DS, and PC.... Yeah, I've got a collection
<SpeedyBolt> Now I can literally just sit there and beat a game in about...an hour or so
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: I never saw the point in the DSi. :D
<superretroworld> earthbound was very underrated
<Moopy> Well on my PSP i have this game called "Pinball Hall of fame" and im a pinball wizard
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: It wasn't interesting to me.
<Freefall29> superretroworld: very. you should mean VERY VERY VERY
<Shizuka> 13not sure if anypony still watching
<oni_link> The only console company I still happily go back to time after time is Nintendo
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: I still am.
<HoodyNinja> Shizuka: Look at the chat!
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka of course I'm still watching
<superretroworld> Freefall29: eeyup
<SpeedyBolt> I am :p
<Nittany_Discord> I'm watching. Won't be for long.
<Canadian_Brony> HoodyNinja -_(\
<HoodyNinja> Everypony watching!
<SpeedyBolt> and did somebody mention Earthbound?
<VenHur> Oh, and I also LOVED DKC Returns.
<Kandarihu> I'm watching, kinda
<otakon1> I'm back
<otakon1> and I am
<Freefall29> final fantasy 6 vs 7.
<HoodyNinja> Canadian_Brony: ;)
<Cypresswolf> Unnr: You are among the extremely few people I've talked to that know what Bucky O'Hare was /)
<Freefall29> hard choice there
<oni_link> We are Shizuka but we are talking memorable consoles :P
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: SAME HERE. That game was FANTASTIC.
<Unnr> Freefall29: 6, no questions asked
<SpeedyBolt> I've beaten that game 3 times, one alone, 2 times with friends
<Canadian_Brony> Freefall29 I choose Super Mario Sunshine >.>
<Unnr> Cypresswolf: (\
<VenHur> When I heard the news Retro Studios is working on that game, my jaw dropped like there's no tomorrow.
*Unnr still occasionally sings the Bucky O'Hare themesong in the shower
<Freefall29> 7 was awesome, but 6 is... damn. I gotta say 6.
<JRP> Phase4: SuperBrony64 is a cow
<oni_link> Anyone here remember the Ninja Gaiden series on NES? THOSE GAMES WERE HARD'
<SpeedyBolt> >Ninja Gaiden on NES
<Canadian_Brony> bbl, need to eat supper
<SpeedyBolt> ...That wasnt hard.
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Plus, I was sick of the Kremlings being the villains, anyways.
<Nittany_Discord> NES games were hard in general.
<SpeedyBolt> That was brutal.
<Nittany_Discord> Never beat an NES game.
<Cypresswolf> Unnr: Do you remember what their ship was called? :)
<Brad__> Im making an extra large rainbow dash :) going to take about 9 hours to print.
<SpeedyBolt> Mind-raping brutal.
<shibaru> Which Cure is the original o__o;
<Freefall29> oni_link: I own ninja gaiden 1. I still remember cursing. I hate those #$*()_@ birds
<VenHur> I mean, how can they pulled it off from a dark first person shooter, to a more kid friendly platformer?
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: I still cant beat 2 and 3
*AJIsAwesome never beat SMB as a kid. :$
<Nittany_Discord> Earliest game I ever beat was Super Mario World, but I nearly 100% that game.
<HoodyNinja> I mastered SNES mario kart
<Unnr> Cypresswolf: The Righteous Indignation, duh
<SpeedyBolt> I find it harder than Kid Icarus.
<oni_link> Freefall29: ALways with the birds, I know your pain /)
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ YES!
<HoodyNinja> I WAS A GOD!
<Cades> The one who's staring at the chicks ass, obviously.
<VenHur> And so we played the game...our questions is UNACCEPTIBLE!
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: I cant beat Kid Icarus D:
<SpeedyBolt> HoodyNinja: Funny, I actually suck at that game.
<cachi01|muffin> I have right now in my hand MK3, street.fighter II turbo and DK country 3 :)
<SpeedyBolt> It's SO hard, oni_link D:
*AJIsAwesome misses the Nintendo Cereal.
<Freefall29> I can beat the turbo tunnel in battle toads easily
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<HoodyNinja> SpeedyBolt: It used to be the only game i had
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: I love the game but I had to put it down because of that :/
<shibaru> -tells Cure to be cloned- The one getting on the cloning machine is obviously the real one :D
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Funrise Toys Offices - When You See It.... Edition
<Moopy> Hey guys im going to lay down on my bean bag looking and watching the chat and the stream so if anypony needs me of something just ping me or something ok but i'll be here
<Cades> lol
<oni_link> Freefall29: Im jealous
<SpeedyBolt> So I went into my room, and I found a few Genesis cartridges.
<shibaru> But now there's 7.... hmmm
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: this ought to be good
*HoodyNinja lost all his old games when he moved
<Freefall29> I think ninja gaiden really improved my reflexes.... and FPS games like tf2 and doom.
<SpeedyBolt> Aero the Acrobat, Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic 3D Blast
*VenHur "NIN-TEN-DO! It's two cereals in one, wow!" ...GOD, I WANTED THAT CEREAL!
<otakon1> the "I hate mix" apparently?
<JRP> Fight_club
*Unnr really wants to see a modern re-make of the Mutant League Sports game series
<SpeedyBolt> ...I played Sonic 3D Blast WAY too much
*Freefall29 slaps JRP
<JRP> F1ght club
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: Did you ever play Sonic Spinball?
<otakon1> Unnr: Bloodbowl is close to it
<Cypresswolf> O_O I spy a Vinyl Scratch in that EQ pic
<VenHur> Too bad I was borned in the N64 days...
<SpeedyBolt> I remember, but it was on a different system
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: I actually liked Sonic SPinball. :$
<HoodyNinja> JRP: Fight Club?
<Freefall29> JRP: changing the title still counts as breaking rules 1 and 2
<SpeedyBolt> I could NEVER beat Spinball.
<Unnr> otakon1: Not in the slightest, really. Bloodbowl is warhammer fantasy and turn based.
<HoodyNinja> Holy shit Sumica actually did it
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: Did what?
<otakon1> Unnr: it's still what Mutant League was based off of
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: I do too but thats another one I never got to beat. As a matter of fact, I never made it out of Toxic Caves :(
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome: Set it up so you get kicked for talking about battle group
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: I couldn't beat the final level. :D
<Nittany_Discord> Been a while since I played L4D(2).
<SpeedyBolt> I made it to The Machine on my last life.
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: Oh.
<flutterchu> 4..wait a minute 3 you...dont let me abandon you/um hello
<Freefall29> I remember my genesis games. sonic 1 and stuff. I had aladdin and I would always die at the lava escape level
<SpeedyBolt> My brother was a Sonic 1 fanatic.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: its the bane of my existance next to Contra which is another on my list :/
<SpeedyBolt> I personally preferred Sonic 2 and 3, because of the Multiplayer
<HoodyNinja> ps2 was my personal favourite system <3
<Buytoast> YOU'RE TOO SLOW!
<AJIsAwesome> I was neutral about the Sonic vs Mario war. I loved both of them equally.
<AJIsAwesome> COME ON, STEP IT UP!
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: Those were my favorite also :3
<VenHur> Oh, Mutant League Sports, that was the time when football gives an "F YOU!" to the NFL lisence.
<Unnr> otakon1: But then you get into Mutant League Hocky
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: me too /)
<VenHur> I mean, football games.
<Cades> You should see how many you can clone before the game crashes :p
<Freefall29> super mario bros 2 ftw. I don't care what you say, its awesome
<SpeedyBolt> and I could not bring myself to stop loving Tails.
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: (\
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: I actually didn't mind that game. It was pretty good, IMO.
<SpeedyBolt> But I personally think my favorite systems are the N64 and Dreamcast.
<oni_link> Freefall29: I liked it too, it was a nice change up, it got the same cold shoulder as Zelda II just because they wanted to do something new
<VenHur> As for the game itself...HOLY BLOODY BATMAN CRUNCHIES! I LOVED IT!
<AJIsAwesome> Much better than the Japan version. :S
<HoodyNinja> Why is everyone on this sight a gamer?
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: Classic Tails <3
<SpeedyBolt> Classic Tails is best Tails.
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: /)
<SpeedyBolt> (\
<Freefall29> the new sonic as a whole is annoying
<flutterchu> i wish banjo and kazooie were still here (i dont beleve theyll make another game)
<VenHur> Okay, new subject, let's talk about water levels.
<SpeedyBolt> Banjo had a heart attack from all that Piz-
<SpeedyBolt> Labyrinth Zone. I liked it.
<VenHur> Let's face it, THEY SUCKED, but then you got some rare goodys.
<oni_link> Freefall29: he has some redeeming qualities, its just that its gotten to story heavy when its always been about stopping Robotnik.
<flutterchu> VenHur: i dont remember banjo kazooie having a water level unless you count rusty bucket bay
<twilight_sprinkle> VenHur: p1+ro*g*h1+1/2*ro*v^2=constant
<HoodyNinja> VenHur: Clankers cavern was so easy for me!
<SpeedyBolt> One nightmare that I will NEVER forget
<oni_link> Freefall29: and the acting is horrendous
<SpeedyBolt> Rusty Bucket Bay
<twilight_sprinkle> VenHur: hows that for water levels
<Unnr> HoodyNinja: Games are a common cultural touchstone in the generations that view the site. Its the same thing as earlier generations sitting around talking about movies.
<SpeedyBolt> and Jolly Roger's Lagoon.
<JRP> Super Metroid SuperBrony64
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVED Labyrinth Zone's music. Favorite track from Sonic 1.
<Unnr> You don't have to be a gamer to have played and loved a few games
<Freefall29> contra ftw
*AJIsAwesome misses video game cereal. :(
<VenHur> Sewer Surfin' from TMNT 4 Turtles in Time was a breath of fresh air from...THAT OTHER WATER LEVEL.
<HoodyNinja> Now i feel like playing tf2...
<Freefall29> me and my bro, man. those were the days
<oni_link> Water Levels... Honestly all I can add to this is THE WATER TEMPLE in OOT
<AJIsAwesome> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Enough said. :(
<VenHur> *cough* *TMNT 1* *cough*
<SpeedyBolt> Fuck OoT's Water Temple
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: oh crap I forgot that, YOU WIN
<SpeedyBolt> What about Great Bay Temple?
<Freefall29> ocarine of time is overrated. its not as good as link to the past. no where near as close.
<AJIsAwesome> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Pies. *sigh*
<Unnr> How about that darned lava chase sequence in the Aladdin game?
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: that thing was a bitch D:
<Cades> What should I call my new tune?
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 spy spam :D
<SpeedyBolt> oni_link: IKR?! So much water level changing...
<HoodyNinja> Freefall29: And even that is beaten by Twilight Princess
<Freefall29> HoodyNinja: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA- no.
<VenHur> Ecto Cooler flavor...SIGH...
<HoodyNinja> Freefall29: :D
<oni_link> Freefall29: It was my first zelda experience which is why I like it but it is overrated and it ruined LTTP for me :/
<AJIsAwesome> I miss TANG........*sigh*
<Unnr> VenHur: Somepony backsolved the Ecto Cooler recipe
<SpeedyBolt> I cant bring myself to hate one Zelda game.
<AJIsAwesome> Unnr: They did?! :O
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: and ice platforms ....They had us going up and down and all around like fools and it took FOREVER
<HoodyNinja> this is awesome
<JRP> Freefall29 no oot was epic
<Freefall29> thing about OOT. The dungeon boss is very close. go in, take a left. and you're there. in LTTP, you gotta go up several floors (or down) and bring potions are required. I'm at the water temple atm, and not a single potion was used yet.
<SpeedyBolt> oni_link: and they purposely put Gyorg there
<SpeedyBolt> JUST TO PISS US ALL OFF
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: I dont hate LTTP by any means but I feel like if I had played that one first I would be agreeing with you
<Ponies47> Dang you caht derps!
<Ponies47> *chat
<HoodyNinja> Freefall29: Nobody uses potions
<Freefall29> also, that god damn navi keeps telling me the boss weakness. in lttp, half the fun was finding the boss weakness and exploiting it
<shibaru> XD
<HoodyNinja> in oot
<SpeedyBolt> People used potions in aLttP?
<VenHur> Unnr: ...GIVE THAT MAN A FUCKING MEDAL! [no, really]
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: SCREW GYORG
<HoodyNinja> Freefall29: Same for TP
<Freefall29> in link to the past. its almost required
<SpeedyBolt> OMG
<SpeedyBolt> THIS SONG
<oni_link> awww damn SONIC 3D
<SpeedyBolt> I've mastered that Sonic game.
*AJIsAwesome actually liked Sonic 3D. :$
<SpeedyBolt> ...When I was, mabye 6.
<Nittany_Discord> Have two degrees. Not using any of them at the moment. :/
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: that game was soo weird to me
<Kandarihu> I remember that xkcd
<SpeedyBolt> It was a bit straightfoward
<cachi01|muffin> Guys this are some of my games :) http://t.co/EpuOqf3W
<Freefall29> anybody played mother?
<SpeedyBolt> Kill robots, get flickies, feed them to rings.
<SpeedyBolt> Mother, as in...Ninten and things?
<VenHur> I actually liked Sonic 3D Blast...I don't mind the overhead angle and the gameplay...
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: I'm pretty sure something will turn up eventually.
<otakon> nice setup cachi01|muffin
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Me too.
<VenHur> But yeah, it COULD of been better.
<Cades> haha no
<HoodyNinja> My mom used to be the best gamer in the family
<Nittany_Discord> It will.
<cachi01|muffin> otakon thx.i need a bigger tv lol
<SpeedyBolt> I'm the best gamer in my family.
<Cypresswolf> I need to change my background - Anypony have an awesome Lyra background?
<oni_link> yeah, but i mean the game play was really floaty to me. I dont hate it but i cant sit and play it for too long
<Freefall29> SpeedyBolt: yeah. mother 1... earthbound zero.
<VenHur> ...Sigh...If only Sonic Mars/Xtreme was ever released...
<otakon> cachi01|muffin: it's okay
<otakon> Bill Nye?
<otakon> nice remix Shizuka
<SpeedyBolt> I can only get beat in Pokemon, by my friend.
<AJIsAwesome> Stupid fire alarm........BRB.
<oni_link> VenHur: I know :/
<Cades> how about beatdown lol
<VenHur> BILL BILL BILL BILL
<Cades> ill name it that
<SpeedyBolt> BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL
<HoodyNinja> BOB

<Unnr> Guardian Bob is better!
<shibaru> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma5x83Nnp91rywedzo1_500.jpg The oxygen bar broke again :(
<cachi01|muffin> Spongebob is better
<HoodyNinja> Bob the procrastinator!
<oni_link> I wish that the 64DD would have been released worldwide and had success, we would have seen a TOTALLY DIFFERENT OOT and ZELDA DLC
<SpeedyBolt> Bob the Builder built my house.

<SpeedyBolt> >Hated Clifford
<shibaru> Good thing Cure is there to fix it :P
<HoodyNinja> I still love clifford to this day
<SpeedyBolt> Clifford hates you too.
<SpeedyBolt> So does Emily.
<shibaru> Lol
<MASF123> :D
<oni_link> I loved Mr Rogers :<
<Cypresswolf> Mr. Magic, anypony? :)
<HoodyNinja> I will fight anyone in here about it
<Buytoast> Clifford and His Big Giant Red Ass
<VenHur> Cliff Hanger, hanging from a cliiiff...
<SpeedyBolt> Mr.Rogers scared me, but I still watched him alot.
<Cades> Cure is there to fix everything. THANK YOU CURE <3
<Buytoast> And that's why he's called Cliff Hanger
<LadyCanary> And thats why he's called Cliff Hanger, VenHur :3
<Cypresswolf> You Can't Do That On Television? :)
<HoodyNinja> My hands smell like bleach!
<VenHur> God, I loved that skit...
<SpeedyBolt> Who did you murder?
<oni_link> IKR^
<cachi01|muffin> If clifford was.male..... And he was giant...... Oh god those,people didnt deserved.to watch that
<Buytoast> I bet Cliff Hanger prayed for everyday to be his last.
<WildRepublicGuard> hoodyninja: i <3 that show
<shibaru> HOORAY FOR CURE!!!
<Buytoast> Imagine your fate being to hang on a cliff forever.
<oni_link> cachi01|muffin: he was probably spayed/neutered :D
<LadyCanary> This is some good music Shizu :3
<Cades> HIP HIP
<Cypresswolf> Really? O_o Nobody....:S Thats a shame no one remembers those shows
<shibaru> PENIS!!!
<HoodyNinja> Buytoast: Epic upper body workout!
<Cades> XD
<otakon> shine on
<Buytoast> Not when you're just dangling there.
<SpeedyBolt> Cliff Hanger, the 24/7 show
<Kandarihu> I remember watching PBS Kids for WAY too late in my life. My mom kept me sheltered from the non-educational cartoons for a while. But even after the restraints came off, I felt like I was making myself better by sticking to PBS. In it's defense, I loved Square One TV
<HoodyNinja> WIN!
<VenHur> I think I remember ONE episode of Cliff, something's to do with a genie...
<MASF123> What's that graph on the right?
<VenHur> ...I don't know, my mind's blank on that show.
<Kandarihu> I think I was about 12 when I finally stopped watching PBS
<SpeedyBolt> I find myself watching Arthur after school sometimes.
<HoodyNinja> MASF123: Something to do with music
<MASF123> oh
<oni_link> MASF123: system info i think
<oni_link> like FPS
<VenHur> And I said, HEY! [Hey!] What a wonderful time to play.

<Buytoast> The gerbil in the nightgown
<cachi01|muffin> N64*
<SpeedyBolt> She's working corners now.
<Buytoast> Did she just up and vanish?
<Kandarihu> One of my earliest favorite cartoons were Muppet Babies and Garfield & Friends.
<HoodyNinja> cachi01|muffin: I was never good at that game :/
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: thats horrible :D
<SpeedyBolt> To be honest.
<Nittany_Discord> Turok was fun. Turok 2 was one of the best FPSs ever made.
<SpeedyBolt> Building corners doesnt seem too hard.
<oni_link> lmao oh you :3
<shibaru> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsqmicSmdq1qju6n5o1_500.jpg Those are some tiny boobs

<Shizuka> 13LONG AGO IN A DISTANT LAND
<Canadian_Brony> that . . . no. Just, just no.
<Reikim> I'm just disappointed in EQD for doing this.

<Reikim> Once upon a time they were better than this.
<otakon> I AKU! THE SHAPESHIFTING MASTER OF DARKNESS!

<CrimsonPhoenix> Woah do we hate Sethisto this much?
<otakon> BUT! A FOOLISH SAMURAI WITH A MAGIC SWORD STEPPED FORTH TO OPPOSE ME!
<Reikim> EQD used to have a strict no-spoilers policy.
<cachi01|phone> BECOME HOKAGE OF PONYVILLE?
<Canadian_Brony> SO MUCH CANTERLOCK
<otakon> *swish**slash**cut*
<Canadian_Brony> AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
<cachi01|phone> those spoilers seem legit
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: dat demospice :D
<oni_link> and FlutterMEDIC that was awesome :D
<Shizuka> 13I TWORE OPEN A POHTAL IN TIME
<Reikim> Shizuka: BUT! A FOOLISH PONY STEPPED FORTH TO- Haha, as if, nobody dares tell Sethisto to shut up about Trixie.
<JESmith71> Shizuka: I saw that description earlier this morning long before it made EqD posted it. It seems the episode description comes from a website for the S3 DVD that gives summaries of the episode
<Reikim> Why? Because there are people that read EQD who don't want spoilers.
<otakon> BEFORE THE FINAL BLOW WAS STRUCK, I TORE OPEN A PORTAL IN TIME AND FLUNG HIM FAR INTO THE FUTURE WHERE MY EVIL IS LAW!
<Reikim> Now...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> then let them skip that post
<otakon> NOW THE FOOL SEEKS TO RETURN TO THE PAST AND UNDO THE FUTURE THAT IS AKU!!!!!
<Reikim> RSS
<flutter_spin> Enough with Season 3. I don't care about what it is, where it is, who it is, what song ... DANG IT! Must I see keywords of it already?
<Reikim> Looking at it
<MASF123> All caps an no kick, there is no justice
<Reikim> It's just a morals thing.
<otakon> lol
<LadyCanary> Gotta get back, back to the past SAMURAI JACK
<Reikim> You could just as easily say that anyone who doesn't want spoilers in chat can leave chat.
<Cypresswolf> :D Oh man... I dont have any new vidoes clean enough to post here - so have some Black
<AJIsAwesome> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31-YOZ_dY0g
<Ponies47> Dang Web chat client stop derping! D:
*otakon pats MASF123 on the back "It's okay, I get kicked often enough that it evens out"
<Reikim> Why is there a no spoilers policy? Because it's not considerate to everyone else.
<flutter_spin> This deep-thought fanfic is tworing me apart.
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutter_spin, even chat isn't safe
<CrimsonPhoenix> SHUT
<CrimsonPhoenix> DOWN
<CrimsonPhoenix> EVERYTHING
<flutter_spin> lol, dat madagascar
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Would you like some more? Because I can probably one-up it.
<Cypresswolf> *BlackGryphon - RarityLicous http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtLMNrlzoBU
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutter_spin, I love you
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mind you reading a live chat is not like reading something posted on a blog
<flutter_spin> Reikim: lol. I'm writing one.
<JESmith71> ...although it's not really a S3 DVD since only one S3 ep is on it, the rest are from S1 and 2
<Canadian_Brony> Cypresswolf close, but not quite
<Canadian_Brony> soon . . .
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cypresswolf, way to flasly advertise
<Reikim> Concept's the same.
<flutter_spin> Reikim: and no competition. I just want it to kill... uh the imagination that is
<CrimsonPhoenix> falsly**
<CrimsonPhoenix> if that's a word
<Cypresswolf> I think about as close as its going to get for Rarity
<oni_link> Cypresswolf: wow this is the best one yet :)
<JESmith71> It seems the eps on that new DVD are two S3 eps, Sonic Rainboom, It's About Time, and Luna Eclipsed
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Have you read White Box? I recommend it for deep-thought.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Falesly?
<Reikim> CrimsonPhoenix: Falsely.
<flutter_spin> again with White Box. I don't like reading :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but applies differently
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, you dolt it's not even THE rarilicious
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Just a bit of reference. If you don't like reading, though, why are you writing?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys do research before assuming
<CrimsonPhoenix> seriously
<Reikim> Not really.
<Cypresswolf> Still love the Pinkie Pie version :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=FLR9HsA55ivKKU0EAQmXcQLQ
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> EQD is a blog who want the views so yeah to me it's quite obvious they will do things like that
<CrimsonPhoenix> it'll make you look less like an idiot
<Reikim> Bullshit.
<Reikim> EQD needs no more views.
<g> ggg
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cypresswolf, IT'S NOT RARILICIOUS
<Reikim> You do watch their view counter, right?
<AJIsAwesome> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGI4w6nznw8&feature=plcp
<flutter_spin> Reading is personal. You and the story. Writing is an expression.
<shibaru> Sometimes when I cancel a commant, the sim walks in place for a while
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=FLR9HsA55ivKKU0EAQmXcQLQ&feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=Lhif1x_d_AQ
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.gamesprays.com/images/icons/fine-jeez-3993_preview.jpg
<Reikim> If anything, this is perhaps worse.
<flutter_spin> Reading outloud is totally acceptable, when someone is willing to listen.
<g> :[ ello
<CrimsonPhoenix> no seriously and I'm talking about everything
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not really since 100000000

<Reikim> They're no longer out for the views.
<g> :P...ello!
<Canadian_Brony> hi g

<Reikim> And regardless of WHY they did it, it's still inconsiderate.

<sub06905> ello NocturnalBlade
<Kinixys> otakon: Just finda buyer local. It beats trade in I would imagine.
<Canadian_Brony> Microsoft is cheap with their 360. You pay hundreds of dollars for everything, pay continuosly for internet, and then you get Red Ring the day after your warranty expires.
*sub06905 plays xbox :$
*cachi01|phone plays almost everything
<otakon> Kinixys: screw that I'll trade it in at Gamestop when I'm fully done with it...should get at least 15 for it
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo you won't believe how many times i've seen somepony ask for the name of that and only got "I dunno" as a reply
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: maybe in the R1s. and yeah you pay for their online but its 9 buck a month
<oni_link> not that expensive

<Kandarihu> About that Fire Hive PMV, I generally take issue with stuff that derails characters in a bad way. Personally, I feel like that PMV fits Queen Chrysalis pretty well.

<Cypresswolf> I just found the Step Ponies trailer - one of the first fan videos I saw, got deleted about a year ago while taking out some vids taken down during one of the troll flag raids - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6v1tTiuCM&feature=related
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03The thing about EqD is... it;s not MLG L3G1T
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: :<
<PillowPoni|Phone> DerpyMuffins: and that's good how? Unless you're being sarcastic
<superretroworld> otakon: even the rare micro?
<otakon> superretroworld: eeyup
<otakon> I liked the micro
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 IKR? Stupid spoilers. They should know better
<NocturnalBlade> DerpyMuffins: for what?
<otakon> the only thing I didn't like was the lack of gameboy support
<DerpyMuffins> It means that my fanfic was good enough to be considered rejectable by EqD itself
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: They should know better -_-
<superretroworld> cool
<OtakuTom> The micro was the only game boy I actively avoided getting...I at least wanted all the others...lol
<Reikim|GW2> Hey Scoot-Scootaloo. Thanks for completely messing up any chance of me sleeping at all.

<Pearly> hey there everypony
<OtakuTom> Or for pushing a car, you move fast, but the car wouldn't as much, since the player character weighs so much less.

<Cipher> 0,14MIKUUUUUUUU
<oni_link> VenHur: supposadly something happened and they had un-credit him for the soundtrack but I believe he was a part of it. this is speculation of course but i think he was involved. theres a WHOOO soundbyte that sounds alot like his
<GabeMoist> Dat Miku
<Polydunami|PS> Miku, is that you?
<mitamaking> Sonic Adventure 2 Barrle is one of my favorite games ever
<OtakuTom> Okay...I have a reason for thinking of Miku when I saw that teal streak...lol
*Cipher waves fist
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Never heard of that one.
*Canadian_Brony doesn't get it
<VenHur> Hatsume Miku?!
<mitamaking> *Battle

<Meanwhile> It's nice Shizu.
<LadyCanary> :O Shizu likes Miku?
<Shizuka> 13this is the only one i have
<LadyCanary> Ah xD
<Canadian_Brony> LadyCanary what gave you the hint?
<Shizuka> 13but i played the hell out of it on audiosurf
<LadyCanary> Seems like a fun song to play ^_^
<Petrified_Discord> This song forces me to rock left to right in my chair. I ain't even mad. :/
<Canadian_Brony> Audiosurf . . . I don't get it.
<Petrified_Discord> Canadian_Brony: ^
*VenHur wished there's a Hatsume Miku song in DDR.
<Shizuka> 13i bumped audio quality way up but i'm sure the bass isn't getting through as well as it should
<OtakuTom> I've been playing the song Secret Police for a while now on the new Project Diva game.
<Kandarihu> I'm kinda downloading the software right now. 32GB over Rapidshare is going to take almost 2 weeks, though
<Meanwhile> I hope it's at least interesting.
<scottish-geeky> BOX
<Kandarihu> OtakuTom, how is that Project Diva game?
<kirzstryfe> same
<OtakuTom> I really like it.
<scottish-geeky> http://www.lulztruck.com/38922/as-a-guy-who-works-every-weekend/ ohh spider man
<kirzstryfe> I'm thinking after guild bank, we shoot for the guild armorer
<Kandarihu> The Lobby monitors in PSO2 are still playing that Project Diva ad alongside a promo video for an upcoming patch.
<kirzstryfe> get some armor with the emblem on it :)
<oni_link> lmao scottish-geeky
<Canadian_Brony> scottish-geeky LoLz
<scottish-geeky> oni_link: lol
<OtakuTom> It's got all the same features from the previous games, better graphics since it's on Vita, and the soundtrack is real good, with 32 songs.
<Shizuka> 13Saihate [Piano Cover]
<scottish-geeky> Canadian_Brony: lolz
<Shizuka> 13beautiful song
<Cipher> 0,14do you have a link to your emblem?
<kirzstryfe> might be able to pull something up once we pick it out
<Canadian_Brony> true
<otakon> aye
<Kandarihu> Oh, so it's a sequel?
<otakon> pretty song
<kirzstryfe> I haven't even seen the interface for it all yet
<Cipher> 0,14ah
<otakon> suddenly DOS
<Canadian_Brony> not my cup of tea, but it is good
<kirzstryfe> but I'll get a SS once it's done
<Kandarihu> Ah, good old IT
<otakon> ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
<Canadian_Brony> . . . I dont' even drink tea
<Petrified_Discord> Future music of the past. WAT.
<otakon> I'm liking this already
<Shizuka> 13i have a pretty good collection of tracker music
<oni_link> wait what tracker is this? it looks familiar
<Canadian_Brony> Petrified_Discord Timeception!
<Shizuka> 13impulse
<VenHur> JonTron: OH. MAI. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWD!
<oni_link> oh
<otakon> damn I am digging this
<OtakuTom> I really wouldn't call it a sequel neccessarily...well...maybe, though it is technically the 5th game in the series (2 PSP games, one PS3 game, an Arcade game, and now this one for Vita)
<Canadian_Brony> I am trying to figure out what it is I'm looking at
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> anypony remember Sailor Moon? remembered it and checked out the op,ah memories :$
<oni_link> a song made in Impulse Tracker.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Chiptune programmer.
<Canadian_Brony> looks "futuristic" from an 80's point of view
<Canadian_Brony> ah
<Shizuka> 13the notes are in the center
<Shizuka> 13i was never terribly fond of the percussion, but the bass line is so powerful in this one
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man awesome song :)
<kirzstryfe> got some blindbags tonight, one was the shiny Caramel
<oni_link> IT is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy over my head. Im just gonna stick to Famitracker
<Canadian_Brony> there is a good reason why I sing the music and not write it
<Canadian_Brony> or play it
<VenHur> Canadian_Brony: It said 97, not 87...
<Meanwhile> Keep it away from Shamroc
<Canadian_Brony> whatev
<scottish-geeky> thers a lak of metal
<Shizuka> 13the blips at the bottom are kind of visualizing the notes
<kirzstryfe> hehe
<oni_link> I really love the bass in this
<Shizuka> 13scottish-geeky: if you don't like it shut up and do something else, stop complaining at us because it's clear you are in the minority
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Tara Strong's Other DragonCon Panel
<Meanwhile> That looked like it stung.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> kinda reminds me of a mix off Megaman X and maybe Shinobi
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I want to say he's whining, but I doubly know better.
<scottish-geeky> Shizuka: im not comlpaing im trying to make jokes if i am pissing you of i am sorry
<NocturnalBlade> Sketch_Toku_Brony: was just thinkin that
<Canadian_Brony> Close . . .
<oni_link> Shizuka: can we listen to AUCR by STU later? :3
<Kandarihu> This music is TOO DARN GROOVY!

<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Bye!
<scottish-geeky> by VenHur
<Shizuka> 13i love isolating channels
<Meanwhile> Well, a bit down the emblem line is some manner of combined sun and crescent moon, that's rather nice.
<Shizuka> 13trackers is best music
<Meanwhile> I can hear bits of Unreal Tournament in this.
*oni_link hugs Shizuka
<oni_link> yes
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> 0_o i hope Kamen Rider OOO,NEVER EVER gets americanized if it becomes THIS :D http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=5&q=kamen+rider#/d5eerd5

<oni_link> i really like the snare sample in this one
<Meanwhile> Personally I think that one's a bit too obnoxious.
<kirzstryfe> there is a crescent moon as well, but it's in game and not on the page
<kirzstryfe> I do too, but it's there :P
<Moopy> Hey is there a stream going on sense i have to refresh it?
<Shizuka> 13that bass was awesome too
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> daw poor luna's tryin to sleep http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&global=1&q=mlp#/d5024i2
<Meanwhile> Well there is a sun in the backgrounds list, perhaps you could overlay the moon on that.
<kirzstryfe> wait, it is http://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/8/83/Guild_emblem_116.png
<Kandarihu> Sketch_Toku_Brony, and what a stream it is

<scottish-geeky> hi JRP sorry imn on deventart
<Shizuka> 13problem is my entire collection of tracker stuff is from five years ago, and the archives are an utter disaster
<Canadian_Brony> reminded me of Shizu's outtro for a sec
<scottish-geeky> Shizuka: hay u shold look up lindsy sturling
*Ponies47 Yawns
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: are u sleepy
<kirzstryfe> the sun is going to be pretty subdued, but think more yellow or red?
<Ponies47> Time for sleep :3
<oni_link> Shizuka: yeah its hard to organize. but i dont think 5 years is alot of time, I listen to NSF files made in 03 and earlier :D
<Ponies47> Good night everypony :)
<thelonepony> night Ponies47

<oni_link> *95
<Meanwhile> Because that's a colour now.
<Shizuka> 13but by five years ago i mean it's an archive i took of my box as an emergency backup... which was during high school... which was disaster shizu
<kirzstryfe> eeyup
<kirzstryfe> :P
<Shizuka> 13so they're scattered all over the place down there
<Ponies47> Thanks for the stream Shizuka :3
<kirzstryfe> emblems are 2-tone
<Shizuka> 13thankfully i can still navigate five years old filesystems perfectly
<Meanwhile> Fair enough. I guess whichever's the better compliment.
<kirzstryfe> so blue with darker blue
<oni_link> ohhh thats good :P lol
<Shizuka> 13just a matter of remembering where the clusters were
<Canadian_Brony> 95 . . high school . . . great, now I feel like I'm the youngest one here
*Ponies47 Goes to bed
<Shizuka> 1395 wasn't high school for me no, 2007 was

<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: you would say that :P
<otakon> hiya OneTrickPony
<otakon> Shizuka: what's a tracker?
<Shizuka> 13or at least it comes from the cluster of trackers i got from dad, which i knew he'd built up around 97 or 98
<Kandarihu> Oh, I recognize this music. I believe the game it's used in is called Meritous
<Shizuka> 13not knowing what they were :3
<MASF123> I should have let that bot die. This is what being a good guy gets you into.
<oni_link> wow, your dad used to collect these?
<Shizuka> 13way back on aol :3
<MASF123> I am now Left 4 the Dead
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka so if my math is correct, you're in your early twenties. Why do I still feel so young? I feel like I know nothing that existed before Y2K!
<Shizuka> 1322
<Canadian_Brony> I HATE FEELING YOUNG!!!
<Shizuka> 13i love this ending so much
<oni_link> I wish my dad was into this stuff , Im jealous shizu
<Shizuka> 13he wasn't so much into it as he had it lying around :3
<Shizuka> 13so that was the original, this is a remix by someone else some years later
<otakon> Shizuka: I'm not into pc stuff rmemeber? what is a tracker?
<Shizuka> 13what you're looking at
<GabeMoist> Trackers are magic
<oni_link> haha but thats still so cool :P and this ought to be good

<Shizuka> 13when it comes to irc i usually put everyone at 20 and go up or down by their behavior
*kirzstryfe is at 2
<Shizuka> 13though when i started irc at 17 i was mistaken for like 26 >>
<oni_link> so what did you think I was at first shizu? :)
<scottish-geeky> ......
<scottish-geeky> ...............
<scottish-geeky> .
<Shizuka> 13see but if someone asks i'll just say 20 or around there :3
<OneTrickPony> I am the youngest person here right now >_>
*AJIsAwesome was probably a 15 on the scale. XD
<Meanwhile> Why would you want to know what shizu actually thinks of you.
<Petrified_Discord> What is this, "guess my age" time? XD
<Shizuka> 13oh hey! the timestamps are still valid on these
<scottish-geeky> -_(\
<Canadian_Brony> I want to know more about the past because I wasn't there. It was relatively recent but so far away.
<NocturnalBlade> am i the oldest here?
<Moopy> *zzzzzzzzzzzz*
<Shizuka> 13the original ice frontier got touched but next is one from 1992
<oni_link> Meanwhile: why not?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon is the oldest here
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: How old are you?
<Meanwhile> oni_link: Because she probably hates you.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: currently
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: 23...soon to be 24 in november
<otakon> but there is another...
<Polydunami|PS> Not quite, NocturnalBlade.
<AJIsAwesome> Okay. 18 over here.
*otakon speaks of Kencolt, the grand-elder of Bronystate.
<Shizuka> 13timestamped october 6 1992
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: cypresswolf?
<otakon> no
<otakon> Kencolt
<scottish-geeky> i must resist to slam my face in my kybord
<Shizuka> 13rocking the retro 4 channels
<oni_link> Meanwhile: lol well Id rather know than someone putting up a facade
<Meanwhile> kencolt is like, 50.
<Petrified_Discord> Shit, really? :D
<GabeMoist> Shizuka, that's really close to how old I am
<NocturnalBlade> how are you then otakon
<Shizuka> 13and of course being a tracker, this 4:15 song weighs 140kb
<otakon> NocturnalBlade: 28
<AJIsAwesome> I wasn't really a good newcomer to bronystate. I didn't know how this place worked and what it was like here, so I learned based off experience.
<Shizuka> 13an equivalent MP3 usually starts at 4MB depending on compression
<Canadian_Brony> I used to feel lucky I grew up as a 21st century kid. Now, I'm looking stories my mother and grandmother would tell of how she grew up.
<NocturnalBlade> oh well then i think i'm in third lol
<scottish-geeky> Shizuka: are u mad at me
<oni_link> Yeah, I made a WAV of an NES sound file and it came out to about 16MB
<otakon> Shizuka: wait, this is more detailed then some songs nowadays, good sounding and it's ONLY 140kb?
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shizuka> 13demoscene does some crazy stuff
<Petrified_Discord> It's gonna suck for the generation right before they discover immortality.
<oni_link> haha otakon has been mind blown :D
<Polydunami|PS> It's weird, even though I'm 22, that I feel like I'm on the older end of the crowd :S
<Shizuka> 13also otakon
<AJIsAwesome> Over time, I adapted to this place, and I love coming here for both the streams and the crazy conversations we have.
<Shizuka> 13there are only four notes playing at a time
<otakon> yes Shizuka?
<otakon> Shizuka: damn really?
<Shizuka> 13you can see them :3
<Shizuka> 13only the black line is playing
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: same...and another reason ^_^
<otakon> this intricate at only four notes?
<Meanwhile> All that looks like is gibberish.
<otakon> GODDAMMIT WHY DOES MUSIC SUCK NOW?

<kirzstryfe> cool
<AJIsAwesome> *"I just met you"*
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: okay but that's a bubblegum fluff song
<Meanwhile> Because frankly smashing things is the only proper answer.
<kirzstryfe> also, calling it right now, the identity of the Master of Whispers
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: http://images.wikia.com/central/images/3/38/Okay_face.jpg

<scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: lol i just got snaped at for saying metal is betre than mario muisc
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: To play Devil's Advocate, without the lyrics it's not a bad melody. Repetitive definitely, but not terrible
<Canadian_Brony> G'night everypony. I'm hitting the hay so I can drown in a sespool of horomones and emotions.
<Shizuka> 13the bass is wubful <3

<Polydunami|PS> This is very neat.
<oni_link> Im thinking of trying Deflemask tracker out.
<twilight_sprinkle> scottish-geeky: yeah i cant stand rap. i dont even think it should be classified as music
<Shizuka> 13(file is timestamped january 1996, so that must have been when dad was collecting)
<AJIsAwesome> I prefer Jazz/Classical(Orchestra)/Electronic. There are more but I can't remember them right now.
<NocturnalBlade> i can listen to just about anything...but i have my limits lol
<Kandarihu> Whatever happened to the Modarchive?
<Polydunami|PS> Although it seems to be between two defined pitches as far as I can hear it.
<Meanwhile> I wonder how much of the story quest is left actually, I'm already level capped.

<scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: thank you all rap is talking slow or fast and raming once or twice
<sub06905> needs moar Cradle Theme from goldeneye n64
<kirzstryfe> it ties into each of the dungeons, that much I know
<twilight_sprinkle> scottish-geeky: exactly! all it takes is a beat, which is like 1% if the full requirement it takes to make actualy music
<Polydunami|PS> These songs need to have more exposure.
<Kandarihu> I only looked after asking. I see, they are still around.
<Shizuka> 13bass getting through okay? this is more awesome than i remember it :3
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Meanwhile> It's alright.
<oni_link> Shizuka: yeah
<Petrified_Discord> My tastes are kinda weird...here's an example: in my playlist "The Stampede" from the Lion King ost is followed by "The Super Mario Super Show Intro in German". I don't even speak German. XD
<scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: and thay say insutls that a 1ft grader make and say ther "hardcor" -_(\
<kirzstryfe> this Charr is so funny

<Kandarihu> You know what? It's good to get back to the basics of what music is all about. It's not about the lyrics, although lyrics are an important, yet optional component of a song. It's certainly not about the artist, and it's not about the debauchery that artists may be pressured into for one stupid reason or another.
*twilight_sprinkle silently sneaks up behind Panda and NOMZ
*scottish-geeky hugs Panda
<Shizuka> 13the theme is pretty much built from C-F-G arpeggios

<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: haaai :3
<OneTrickPony> Polydunami|PS: uh oh O____O

<Shizuka> 13(black meaning the instrument plays from start, red meaning it switches notes without restarting the sample)
<Panda> ^^ I wont tell anyone twilight_sprinkle about your obsessive illegal downloading of free music :3
<Kandarihu> If you're on a residential line, that should be physically impossible.Coaxial cable was only meant to send large amounts of data one way, and not the other.
<oni_link> what is a good repository for these IT/MOD files?
<Shizuka> 13modarchive is still around i hope

*OneTrickPony facepalms
<Kandarihu> Man, that would be an interesting thing to do. Not sure if all the models would REALLY amount to 635TB, though.
<Shizuka> 13part of the fun of trackers is working out which channels are doing what, especially when they switch midway
<Kandarihu> Yeah, that IS fun
<oni_link> Or panning :3
<Shizuka> 13they're almost always percussion on the left and lead nearby, with backups further right
<Shizuka> 13then you get the oddballs where the lead's waaaaay off to the right and who knows where the percussion is coming from

<Dark92Enigma> I heard about it....but forgot what was it about
<Gold_Demona> Dark92Enigma: It's about a knight. :D
<Dark92Enigma> pardon my redundance
<Dark92Enigma> LAWL
<Dark92Enigma> Gold_Demona: like too many movies i know
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<Dark92Enigma> GET ON WITH IT
<Barbetos|AtWork> Red hair guy uses words! its not very effective.
<Nyst> So much food.
*Dark92Enigma Geeeeeeeeeeeet Ooooooon with iiiiiiiit
<Nyst> A duck!
<Gold_Demona> Duck Soup?
<SirGanjalf> hey, what are we watching?
<Gold_Demona> Knight's Tale
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Cat Soup :(
<Barbetos|AtWork> and congestion.
<SirGanjalf> thanks Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> No problem SirGanjalf
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nah. We watching A Jokers Tale.
<Dark92Enigma> BY THE PÓWER OF GRAYSKULL
<Dark92Enigma> GRAYHOUND
<Moopy> I thought he was going to chop that dudes head off
<Barbetos|AtWork> Day dreaming is a funny thing.
<Moopy> Heh nice looking throne chairs
<kirzstryfe> good morning everypony :)
<Gold_Demona> Hax!
<Moopy> Good morning dude
<Nyst> Ooh, a cheater.
<Gold_Demona> The other knight's got hax
<Jmo> Hai kirzstryfe
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: daydreaming is wonderful :)
<Nyst> Cheaters are needed in movies. It gives the hero an excuse to win from an otherwise superior opponent.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh jesus. Caught me daydreaming MadSurge
<Barbetos|AtWork> The ding scared the shit out of me
<MadSurge> :D awesome!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Pony!
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> Heya Lil_B
<MadSurge> OWNED
<Moopy> hey lil b
<Alchemist> good day all
<Dark92Enigma> LIKE A BOSS
<MadSurge> Hello Lil_B and Alchemist!
*Lil_B thanks Barbetos|AtWork Moopy and MadSurge :)
<Lil_B> and hi Alchemist :)
<Moopy> your welcome dude
<Alchemist> hmm, this movie looks familiar. Wasnt this on a recent movie night?
<Alchemist> hi Lil_B!
<Lil_B> I got my new WLan Stick today, I can watch the Stream again :D
<Nyst> This reminds me that War of the Roses is a game that's being made.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Alchemist: I don't think this has ever been shown on a movie night
<Barbetos|AtWork> Which is kind of surprising to me to be honest.
<Alchemist> Barbetos|AtWork: I definitely seen this being streamed here though.
<Vivix> I think war of the roses is done
<Nyst> Lots of freezes though. Or is that just me?
<Nyst> Vivix: last I heard it was still in beta.
<Vivix> oh yea, second october
<Vivix> I was excited until I heard it was third person-
<Alchemist> what?
<Nyst> Vivix: I thought you could play it first person too.
<Nyst> 3rd person is just better for aiming.
<Vivix> well, I hope so- but the videos I've seen of it so far all state "third person game" -
<Nyst> I know you can close your helmet, but then it actually darkens your screen as well.
<Vivix> steam article too say third person game- so I don't think FPS is available, but if it is
<Vivix> they seem to have tried to make it very accurate that way
<Nyst> let me check.
<Alchemist> What is this game you are talking about?
<Vivix> War of the roses
<Nyst> War of the Roses, you can find footage on youtube
<Alchemist> Never heard of it.
<Dark92Enigma> INSERT MEDIEVAL GUILE'S THEME HERE
<Vivix> think quake arena with knights
<Nyst> That's because the game's not out yet.
<Vivix> as far as I understood it's TDM and DM only? /long since seen anything abou the game
<Nyst> gah, jittering
<Nyst> I'm going to miss it.
<Gold_Demona> Heck, just regular Guile's Theme would do. It goes with everything. :P
<Dark92Enigma> TASTE THE SPEAR MUTHAFUCKA
<Alchemist> Call of duty, medieval England?
<Vivix> pretty much
<Nyst> it's very violent.
<Dark92Enigma> They're rubbing him in his face
<Dark92Enigma> TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
<Nyst> You're not whacking a a sword against a healthbar there, you're stabbing people in the face.
<Vivix> yes, the only thing that dissapoitned me, is the third person
<Moopy> Hail to the king baby!
<Vivix> but--yeah
<Alchemist> I got a bit tired of fps type games for now. Im waiting for the Xcom remake.
<Rommulus> screw yo armour!
<Dark92Enigma> LIKE A SIR
<Vivix> I mean it's like, Alan Wake was fun, but I hated playing it because the guy was always in the way on my screen
<SirGanjalf> ^So you don't like 3rd person in general?
<pony_062936> I just got here and what am I tripping on?
<HoodyNinja> Shit there we go
<Vivix> SirGanjalf, pretty much- I can enjoy it if it's..centered, but in alan wake it was over the shoulder, so he was ALWAYS in the way-
<Moopy> That was awesome that was great
<Dark92Enigma> Good movie........
<Vivix> and of course top down, like baldurs gate or fallout is just great, I love that third person style
<Nyst> I'm going to have to go. The stream is too bad for me to follow more of this.
<Alchemist> Vivix: same here, but tps like in GTA doesnt bother me. I think the camera type like in Alan wake is referred to as "over the shoulder" view rather than third person
<Dark92Enigma> NAY, Great one
<Nyst> Oh and it ends. Nice timing.
<Rommulus> I am out, good night everypony
<Vivix> Alchemist, true true, in GTA and S3 and whatnot- it feels right. I think it's over the shoulder that bugs me the most
*Dark92Enigma Insert WE WERE ANGELS (2nd DBZ Ending)
<HoodyNinja> night Rommulus
<Vivix> in War of the roses I only wish it weren't third person at all because they wanted to make everything so period correct and almost realistic-
<Gold_Demona> End a medieval movie with AC/DC. BRILLIANT!
<Nyst> Now that the movie is done, can I link a video?
<SirGanjalf> Vivix: Well i like that in AW you can atleast choose on which side of the screen you character should be.
<Moopy> not yet
<HoodyNinja> So, I cant get on youtube at school, but I can get on facebook? LOGIC!
<Vivix> SirGanjalf, reaally? I must do that- change him to the other side
<Nyst> Moopy: was that to me?
<Moopy> yes
<SirGanjalf> Vivix: I think it's TAB key in PC version.
<Nyst> Anyway, I got a link to WotR. The game stays in third person yet, but it covers your screen as if you're wearing a helmet in first person.
<Vivix> Aah- thanks! Cause when I wanted to read a sign or look at something, I'd always have ot kinda..stand next to it and twist and turn-
<Vivix> Tab will- help
<HoodyNinja> So bored
<Nyst> Quote from the game: "Control wise, the primary focus is getting third person to work perfectly, but if we find the time and succeed in getting the controls just right, who knows... It might require a whole different control set to be at all playable in normal hand to hand combat. The thing is also that a standard first person view raises a number of other issues that has to be resolved as well. We plan to put the camera wherever it is most
<Vivix> but yeah, I'm just a first person fan in all immersion games, I feel third person makes me relate less to the character. Sometimes that's a good thing, as if you're reading about the character, not being him or her, but- often I feel FPS works better in adventure and puzzles
<SirGanjalf> Vivix: Np. Also some signs can be read by pressin "f" or "e"(Huh, i don't remeber, though i've finished it last weekend:P)
<Vivix> Ooh
<MadSurge> Let's hope Wrek is awake :D
<Nyst> Whoa, that looked a lot shorter when I copied it.
<SirGanjalf> Nord Mead!
<Wrek> 05hope you liked
<Wrek> 05i still got a headache so ima gona keep lying down
<Moopy> Ok now you can send video links now
<MadSurge> Wrek: awww
<MadSurge> Take an aspirin then
<Gold_Demona> Wrek's not feeling well? :<
<Nyst> Here you go http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu2-EFYXEX0 I hope you feel better soon Wrek
<Lil_B> Wrek sounds bed -.-
<HoodyNinja> Damn you school!
<Moopy> Get well wrek
<Nyst> If you forward to 12:22 you get (one of) the helmet view.
<HoodyNinja> Wrek needs his wrest
<Nyst> I guess Wrek is wrek'd.
<Dark92Something> BA DUM TSS
*HoodyNinja groan
<Alchemist> http://derpy.me/p9ovd
<Nyst> Thank you, try the veal.
<HoodyNinja> Alchemist: :D wut?
<Nyst> Oh yeah, and the executions are in first person...If you're the one being killed.
<Nyst> Closing the helmet actually gives you a defence bonus against being hit in the head.
<HoodyNinja> Real life is in first person
<Alchemist> HoodyNinja: nothing, just Vinyl bugging the hell outta octavia. Thought it was kinda cute.
<Moopy> i know how you feel wrek i felt the same way as you so get some rest for a while then about few weeks you will feel alot better dude
<HoodyNinja> Its extremely cute!
<HoodyNinja> Confound you bronystate, you drive me to insomnia
<MirrorImage> and that's a bad thing?
<Nyst> Dunno if true, but I heard that if you a blade or arrow in the viewslot of a helmet, you can instakill people.
<HoodyNinja> Ohai MirrorImage
<Nyst> I know for a fact that a lance to the face is an instant kill.
<MirrorImage> Nyst - that's cause a lance to the face tends to go all the way through the head
<Moopy> I hope Therainbowvortex is doing alright guys
<Nyst> Oh yeah, there's an exectution at 15:18
<MirrorImage> ...ok, what are you talk about Nyst?
<Nyst> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu2-EFYXEX0
<Nyst> War of the Roses beta gameplay
<Vivix> You know game I'm excited for? Black mesa source
<Nyst> 2 days 23 hours left.
<Vivix> Kinda want watchdogs too, looked at sleeping dogs too, but that didn'tl ook like my kinda game
<Vivix> Ah the timer keeps on ticking :3
<Vivix> Apparently Xen is not in this release, but the next one or.something
<Vivix> I hope it's not six years until next release
<HoodyNinja> Playdough!
<HoodyNinja> the greatest of all toys
<Alchemist> I beg to differ. Lego is where it's at.
<Moopy> Hey who likes Duke Nukem in here? and who doesn't like it?
<Vivix> Kinda enjoyed the original 3d, never bothered with the other
<Vivix> played some of the original, but not a big platformer fan
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good afternoon people :)
<MadSurge> Vivix: I am and I played the first trilogy :D
<Alchemist> original was good, 3d was better, latest one was meh.
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/z5rRZdiu1UE does this count as rap? If so, I like this rap
<Vivix> MadSurge, hehe, liked it? A friend of mine had it, and I watched her play it- didn't really capture me at the time. I was more into doom then
<Lil_B> hi MLP_Brovakiin and Vivix :)
<Vivix> Hiya Lil_B
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Lil_B :)
<Lil_B> wanted to watch the Rap, casn't because of GEMA grrr
<Vivix> aww
<Moopy> brb
<Vivix> It's beastie boys, sabotage
<MadSurge> Vivix: I liked Doom too, but I grew up in arcades, and I love platformers
