<ChaoMagma> 4thank you Skylands, for getting me those things =)
<Skylands> 10It was funny though
<Skylands> 10When I checked my stuff out, the employee asked, "How old is he?"
<Skylands> 10As if I was buying for a boy
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Poor you
<HyperMetalLugia> But it's the truth
<Skylands> 10I told him it was for me, he went a bit silent

<HyperMetalLugia> 2m is like.. 7 ft

<Kosovo> so 1.5 then
<Kosovo> most of the world uses it, hml

<Quanyails> 7Ah, well...
<Quanyails> 7I'd like to get back to the game. :P
<Skylands> 10I'm quitting Spanish after this year, Kosovo
<Quanyails> 7Unless you have a Ho-oh.
<HyperMetalLugia> Canada is overrated since they use metric ;p
<Skylands> 10I need to focus more on my studies

<Skylands> 10And since only 2 years are required to graduate, I've got more than that
<Skylands> 10:3
<Quanyails> 7I have lots of Deinos with Dark Pulse and Ice Fang.
<HyperMetalLugia> How can you catch a ho-oh o.o

<ChaoMagma> 4yesh
<Quanyails> 7male*
<Kosovo> although I took Spanish 1 in junior high, and while that counts for high school credit here colleges don't count it
<Quanyails> 7Or does it not matter?
<Kosovo> so in their eyes I only have 2 years
<prince-dari> American school system. O_o "Credit" :O
<ChaoMagma> 4i dun really care (though i am sexist :P) if it's trade, gimme a un-genered if it exists
<Quanyails> 7Un-gendered? O_o
<SilverSonic> X3
<ChaoMagma> 4what level?
<HyperMetalLugia> Legendaries are usually un-gendered o.o
<Quanyails> 7 1. :P
<Quanyails> 7Deino is not a legendary. o3o
*SilverSonic tackle hugs Skylands :3
*Skylands returns the hug
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, still.
<HyperMetalLugia> All pokemon are gendered
<SilverSonic> :3
<ChaoMagma> 4although, shiny, normal, or who-cares?
<HyperMetalLugia> Unless you port them to Red version
<HyperMetalLugia> Since I don't think that has genders ;P
<ChaoMagma> 4yeah
<Kosovo> yep, credit
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<ChaoMagma> 4Articuno= female Luiga = male :P
<Kosovo> you need a certain number of credits to graduate
<Quanyails> 7Eh, if you want, Shiny. XD
<Kosovo> here it's 220 I think
<Quanyails> 7Goes along well with my Shiny Lugia. O_o
<prince-dari> What, they just don't let you leave if you don't get enough?

<Quanyails> 7Well, Cherish is the other option.
<prince-dari> Bludgeon it to death then put it in a blunder. :D
*ChaoMagma 4is tinking "The hardest part of catching a PKMN is choosing it's permanent Pokeball.........."

<Buizel> i see
<Armageddon> ohai Drake
<Armageddon> and what, Umbreon?
<Buizel> i need a server exception for tst
<Buizel> stupid ban range lol
<Drake> 04Sister not home, parents not home...hmm
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> huh, Glacymr?
<Armageddon> Ah
<Armageddon> Umbreon, what's the ban?
<Armageddon> oh right
<Buizel> feather's bro
<Buizel> XD
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> actually
<Armageddon> I think that ban can be removed
<Armageddon> seeing as he has gotten on
<Buizel> i dunno
<Armageddon> drf let him back into SW
<Armageddon> and the ban causes problems
<Armageddon> tbqh we can actually make the ban more direct
<Armageddon> as Feather uses a BNC here now
<Armageddon> and thus has a different IP
<Armageddon> moment though, need to oper up
<Buizel> i spoke with draelen about it as well
<Buizel> but he questioned me instead of cooporating lol

<Armageddon> there's one with n00b as the reason lol
<Buizel> hi
<Armageddon> well Umbreon, you could always use a bouncer if you have problems
<Armageddon> because it's technically not ban evading
*Armageddon deopers
<Buizel> XD
<Ascendant> crap, why do our servers not set +x on connect :U
<Ascendant> need to hostmask bopm
<Armageddon> just ask if you want one
<Buizel> okay
<Buizel> you'll have to show me how to do that
<Buizel> later
<Draelen> arti preference I believe, since the beginning of the network
<Draelen> make bopm set it on connect, or give it a nickserv reg and make a hostmask
<Draelen> vhost*
<Armageddon> well, just go to #ZNC in here and type !request
<Buizel> o-o

<Drake> 04For an Infernape with Thunderpunch, Flare Blitz and Close Combat, which move is better to finish up his moveset: Earthquake or U-turn?
<Charles> I wanna live!
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> I usually use Earthquake
<Ascendant> but U-turn is good against psychic types
<Ascendant> and dark types, but close combat takes care of that
<Drake> 04Well I have Hydreigon for Psychic types so
<Ascendant> earthquake is good for rock, steel and that other one
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> poison
<Ascendant> and
<Ascendant> electric
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> you could try stone edge too
<Ascendant> I'd say Earthquake though
<Drake> 04Stone edge has low PP and a lower chance to hit.
<Drake> 04Team selections are hard
<Drake> 04I'm not sure who to substitute for Infernape - Chandelure or Toxicroak

<Ascendant> Infernape is quite good

<Jason> :D
<BackupAristeo> I have some major hackery going on to get connected to Epic Chat
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.dizzy-dee.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ATT00007-300x93.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03rofl
<BackupAristeo> Connected from my phone to Jason's bouncer
<nickstr> I wonder if there are any gain pots inside of the mid 1980s to mid 1990s Delco car stereos for AM and FM
<BackupAristeo> And then from Jason's bouncer a guy in a shady hat takes my messages and stores them under his jacket
<drfsupercenter> 03http://asset.soup.io/asset/1177/1797_9350_450.jpeg
<SilverSonic> Show is live in less than 2 hours :3
<lightumbreon|Unreal2> back, and off for testing some mods :P
<nickstr> on AM mine squeals if I hook anything other than a one or two inch piece of wire
<Jason> his name is frodo
<BackupAristeo> Then he runs off and delivers them to a boy on his bicycle in China
<lightumbreon|Unreal2> hm, thanks SS, will remember it ;3
<BackupAristeo> And he bicycles 10 miles until he reaches the outskirts of Peking, China, where he's greeted by a man who got a bronze at last year's olympic sprint
<BackupAristeo> Not too bad but he was hoping for gold
<drfsupercenter> 03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/b7d3a0a9-381d-4b7b-a150-1994b5b26ad7.jpg
<BackupAristeo> And he casually walks up a mountain until he reaches a man, who lights a bonfire, and off in the distance another man sees that the bonfire is lit and he lights his, which creates a cascade effect over 100's of miles of people catching the bonfire signals and lighting their own bonfires to pass the signal down the chain
<BackupAristeo> Until the signal reaches the Epic Chat datacenters, where the people there, half-drunk, attempt to download my messages from that boy on his bicycle back in China
*BackupAristeo nods
<BackupAristeo> So thanks Jason
<Jason> :)
<Jason> No problem
<Jason> xD

<Nickario> hi Ecco :)
<EccoCode> hey Nick!
<NightSeas> 12Then you crop a few files to the size you want and add them to your gif file in the editor
<Skylands> 10I'll pass
<NightSeas> 12I could do it for you if you show my the pictures you want to use
<NightSeas> 12me*
<Skylands> 10I found another site, but it's a 24-hour trial and then you have to start paying :|
<NightSeas> 12Oh, lol
<drfsupercenter> 03so steal the code within 24 hours?
*drfsupercenter runs
<Skylands> 10lolPHP
<NightSeas> 12php is confusing, lol
<drfsupercenter> 03why can't people just have normal avatars
<drfsupercenter> 03screw super fancy stuff
*NightSeas thinks drf wants a fancy flash video avatar
<Skylands> 10I think there's a mod on avatar rotating for Simple Machines
<Skylands> 10rotating script*
<NightSeas> 12Actually, mods are the preferred way of installing things on SMF
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you want to rotate your avatar
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't want to have to turn my head sideways :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Or control alt >
<Skylands> 10Not the literal meaning
<drfsupercenter> 03then what o.o
<Skylands> 10Image rotation is where an image changes every time you refresh your page
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<NightSeas> 12The idea of having a new avatar every time someone looks at it does sound very interesting
<drfsupercenter> 03still, why?
<drfsupercenter> 03just pick one and stay with it :|
<HyperMetalLugia> If not impossible :P
<Skylands> 10Because I wanted to try something new
<NightSeas> 12Seeya
<NightSeas> 12Wait, drf, you do have a .gif avatar XD
<NightSeas> 12And you said you don't like fancy avatars XD
<drfsupercenter> 03that's not fancy
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the same picture every time :P
<NightSeas> 12It's not a picture though, it's a animated gif
<NightSeas> 12I was thinking about having a animated PNG file as a avatar, but I forgot IE is crappy about APNG files
<NightSeas> 12Only firefox can play them
<NightSeas> 12Which sucks, because there so much better then gif files
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03bbl

<Jerry> okay.

<Armageddon> ignore solstice
<Armageddon> it's being fucked by a firewall
<Quanyails> 7You could get a 'Power' item.
<Quanyails> 7That gives 4 evs to a specific stat after each battle.
<SilverSonic> <%Skylands> ONEONEONEONE1111!!! <-- I keep thinking this "One, oh one, the only thing is one" from Creed. XD
<Skylands> 10uh
<SilverSonic> I think xD
<Skylands> 10does Xanbreon still come here?
<Quanyails> 7You could get a maximum of 14 EVs a battle with Power X, battling a pokemon with 3 EV yield, and pokerus.
<Drake> 04o-o
<Chimera> 04Finished Portal 2
<Chimera> 04Was great
<Quanyails> 7Thoughts?
<Skylands> 10because it's his birthday and stuff
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Skylands> 10btw NS
<Skylands> 10should Birthday thread be moved to Forum Games?
<Skylands> 10since it's just posting "happy birthday!" and getting boosts in post count :P
<Skylands> 10or it can have the same fate as the TST one, getting locked forever
<Damos> What does Portal two look like?
<Damos> what different than the first?
<Damos> seriously
<Skylands> 10The only difference is that the cake is not a lie this time
<Damos> really?
*Skylands was joking around
<Quanyails> 7Lawl.
*Damos falls over
<Quanyails> 7Well, here we are again. (:P)
<Damos> I don't like that idea
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Ray> 02WINternetz much
<Ray> 02Did I missed something?
<Quanyails> 7Portal 2 comments.
<Chimera> 04Thoughts: awesome
<Chimera> 04Well thought out, achievements were pretty great, storyline was original, and there was a bunch of amazing CGI parts
<Chimera> 04And the ending was just awesome
<Quanyails> 7Length?
<Chimera> 04no spoilers
<Chimera> 04um
<Chimera> 043x the length of the first one
<Chimera> 04which is awesome
<Quanyails> 7And then there's the co-op mode.
<Chimera> 04LOL THAT ACHIEVEMENT
<Chimera> 04"Lunacy: That just happened"
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Chimera> 04the achievement Lunacy
<Quanyails> 7I prefer "The Part Where <spoiler> Kills You"
<Quanyails> 7Oh, and LOL:
<Chimera> 04If you beat the game you'll know why that's awesome
<Chimera> 04yes
<Chimera> 04This is that part
<Quanyails> 7My Wooper (will be Quagsire) has max EVs in speed. O__o
<Quanyails> 7Yet Speed is its lowest stat and it has a speed-reducing nature. XD
<Chimera> 04ironic |D
*Quanyails 7still needs to breed for IVs. >>
<Quanyails> 7(Elsethings, lol.)
<Skylands> 10Gtg
<Chimera> 04btw
<SilverSonic> Nuuuuuuuuu
<Chimera> 04Chell's an idiot
*SilverSonic huggles Sky goodbye ;-;
<Chimera> 04Spoiler: 1,1At the end she doesn't take the HHPD with her >>
<Chimera> 04like seriously wtf, 1,1I'd so take it with me despite there being no moon rocks anywhere :V
<Quanyails> 7You remind me of one of GLaDOS's quotes.
<SilverSonic> ooh
<Quanyails> 7If you decide to go with her halfway through the game.
<Chimera> 04I don't think you can decide
<Chimera> 04wait
<Chimera> 04oh
<Quanyails> 7Did you get that achievement for it? :P
<Chimera> 04you mean when she asks you to just complete the last test?
<Chimera> 04yes
<Chimera> 04good listener
<Chimera> 04|D
<Chimera> 04Icon is full of win
<BackupAristeo> o.o
*Angel_Espeon yawns
<Angel_Espeon> 13Goodnight all :3
<Quanyails> 7AE?
<Quanyails> 7D:
<Quanyails> 7But I want to try wi-fi again. o3o
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd love to, but I'm struggling to keep my eyes open right now |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Tomorrow?
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Quanyails> 7Wrong time, right place?
<Chimera> 04cya
<Chimera> 04OMG
<Chimera> 04THAT GUY
<Chimera> 04PLAYS CAVE
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Chimera> 04OH MY GOD EPIC xD
<Chimera> 04And I have respect for Stephen Merchant
<Chimera> 04He and his brittish accent made Portal 2 "quite a bloody awesome game"
<Quanyails> 7Ah, that word.
<Chimera> 04even though the only blood is from you when turrets shoot you :P
<Chimera> 04also
<Quanyails> 7And that's not even blood.
<Chimera> 04pit boss
<Chimera> 04epic achievement
<Chimera> 04Wait
<Chimera> 04I didn't notice; there's no blood in Portal 2 anymore?
<Quanyails> 7Well, you see a flash of red.
<Quanyails> 7But no actual blood. o3o
<Chimera> 04Huh
<Chimera> 04Wonder why they took that out
<Quanyails> 7E. 10 rating.
<Chimera> 04ah
<Quanyails> 7But other things make it very not E-10.
<Chimera> 04yep
<Chimera> 04btw
<Quanyails> 7Personally, I find the Rattmann dens creepy. The music doesn't help.
<Chimera> 04that "Scanned Alone" achievement
<Chimera> 04I didn't get it on purpose LOL
<Chimera> 04I stood in the scanner because I thought I'd somehow break the system
<Chimera> 04it didn't even recognize me lul
<Chimera> 04btw Quan, that one turret on the redemption line
<Chimera> 04that was a live
<Chimera> 04*alive
<Chimera> 04did you save it?
<Quanyails> 7Ah, I remember that.
<Chimera> 04And furthermore did you hear the easter egg it said?
<Quanyails> 7The foreshadowing turret foreshadows.
<Chimera> 04achievement and egg
<Chimera> 04I love Valve
<Quanyails> 7They are detailed in their works.
<Quanyails> 7Not the most I've seen, but pretty much.
<Charles> back
<Chimera> 04They only hire the BEST they can get
<Chimera> 04and for good reason
<Chimera> 04I hope the next game they make is as awesome as P2
<Chimera> 04and holy crap
<Chimera> 04the references to the first game
<Chimera> 04were awesome XD
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Quanyails> 7Hoopy the hoop comes to mind.
<Chimera> 04Remember the Companion Cube chamber?
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Chimera> 04And the (spoiler) 1,1companion cube that came out of the furnice at the end? :3
<Quanyails> 7Yes.
<Chimera> 04I loved that part XD
<Quanyails> 7Then again, you can emancipate those cubes.
<Chimera> 04no
<Chimera> 04GLaDOS does that for you
<Chimera> 04SEVERAL TIMES ;-;
<Quanyails> 7They're a dime a' dozen (backstabbing scumbags [referencesREFERENCES]. o3o
<Quanyails> 7)
<Chimera> 04lul
<Chimera> 04Black Mesa can kiss my- Sir.
<Quanyails> 7Ah, Cave.
<Quanyails> 7Awesome lines Valve wrote for him.
<Quanyails> 7Combustible lemons!
<Chimera> 04Using 1,1Moon rocks
<Chimera> 04I'LL BLOW UP YOUR HOUSE WITH THE LEMONS!
<HyperMetalLugia> lool
<Chimera> 04But its weird
<Chimera> 04I thought that the Portal gun only worked on soft surfaces
<Chimera> 04but apparently the case is they only work on 1,1moon rocks
<Chimera> 04Hence why the ending made so much sense :E
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> But I wonder why Cell 1,1 didn't suffocate there
<HyperMetalLugia> ;O
<Chimera> 04Good lungs? XD
<Chimera> 04http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/Portal2-chamber-comparison.jpg <-- Also one of my favorite parts of the game
<Chimera> 04The old levels making a comeback
<HyperMetalLugia> Though, she would of had to deal with worse ;P
<Chimera> 04But with more WHEATLY
<Quanyails> 7But the chambers look so decrepit... o3o
<Quanyails> 7Wheatley*
<Quanyails> 7And Chell*
<Quanyails> 7And HML?
<HyperMetalLugia> Not to mention higher res :P
<Quanyails> 7GLaDOS comments she 'freshens' the same air she goes through room after room.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes?
<Quanyails> 7Wait, out of context.
<Quanyails> 7Apologies, let me rephrase:
<HyperMetalLugia> It was
<HyperMetalLugia> Badly
<Quanyails> 7There is air on Earth./
<Quanyails> 7It was being vacuumed to outer space.
<Chimera> 04Many of the mid-game puzzles take place in much larger and open areas of the old Aperture Science facilities to make the space "feel epic", according to programmer Jeep Barnett.
<Chimera> 04It worked
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes, but wouldn't that mean the air was lost so she couldn't get a direct flow
<HyperMetalLugia> But even with the air issue solved, she would either freeze or burn to death :P
<Chimera> 04oh
<Chimera> 04yeah you're right Quan
<Chimera> 04also you're spoiling NOBODY ELSE LOOK AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Chimera> 04btw
<Chimera> 04she was very close to the portal
<Chimera> 04So heat could have spilled out from the room
<Chimera> 04along with the rushing air :P
<Quanyails> 7Uh, what's 220 K in F?
<Chimera> 04I wonder if Wheatley and 1,1the defective SPACE core1,1 are made of gold titanium plating
<Quanyails> 7(Temperature)
<Chimera> 04or else they'd ice
<Chimera> 04wait fail
<Chimera> 04umm
<Chimera> 04-63.67 F
<Chimera> 04o.o
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7Chilly.
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice
<Chimera> 04very
<Quanyails> 7The max temperature, according to the kiwi, of the moon, is 390 K.
<Chimera> 04Suprised there was no tornado :P
<Quanyails> 7Which translates to...
<Chimera> 04242
<Chimera> 04o-o
<Chimera> 04242 F
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Even better, she would have to deal with 1,1 deadly solar radiation/wind
<Quanyails> 7Okay, so that's actually plausible.
<HyperMetalLugia> Hot
<Chimera> 04one extreme to another
<Charles> I love this
<Quanyails> 7If the moon's temperature was between that.
<Charles> "We haven't entirely nailed down what element it is yet, but I'll tell you this: it's a lively one and it does not like the human skeleton."
<Chimera> 04She's just lucky |D
<HyperMetalLugia> She should be fine, for around a second :O
<Chimera> 04.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<HyperMetalLugia> Too lucky
<Chimera> 04good job
<Chimera> 04GOOD JOB QUAN
<HyperMetalLugia> LOOOOOL
<HyperMetalLugia> FAIL
<Chimera> 04NOT PUTTING UP SPOILER TAGS
<Chimera> 04shun
<HyperMetalLugia> Everyone, spam
<Chimera> 04:3
<Chimera> 04no
<HyperMetalLugia> Spam, so it goes UP
<HyperMetalLugia> And away
<HyperMetalLugia> Fine, just keep
<Chimera> 04that'd be retarded
<Quanyails> 7Eh, spoilers in IRC?
<HyperMetalLugia> Splitting lines until it goes away :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes, Quan, you made that happen
<Quanyails> 7No, I mean--ah, whatev's.
<Quanyails> 7Interesting, GLaDOS keeps some of her redundancy in Portal 2.
<HyperMetalLugia> Like..?
<Quanyails> 7http://theportalwiki.com/w/images/8/85/GLaDOS_jailbreak06.wav
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah, lawls
<HyperMetalLugia> GLaDOS loves repeating herself
<HyperMetalLugia> Random: The portal gun's "claw" at the end is slightly longer and thinner in portal 2
<HyperMetalLugia> Or so it looks like

<GhostX> :/
<Ascendant> I haven't tested BOPM yet
<Ascendant> so if we get nailed again
<Ascendant> can't guarantee it'll stop them
<GhostX> but I suppose the original purpose of bncs was not for gline evasion hah
<HyperMetalLugia> Any reason or source of the attacks?
<HyperMetalLugia> (Doubt you can install DEFCON on Island)
<GhostX> So does Fluorine still get on here often/
<Ascendant> defcon is on services
<Ascendant> kinda not needed as there's BOPM
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh good
<HyperMetalLugia> Not like it ever needs to be used XD
<Ascendant> defcon is slightly pointless
<Ascendant> I only use it because I cbf to check every channel to see where the bots are attacking
<Ascendant> xD
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> SO you cut off all connections instead
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad girl
<Ascendant> I only used defcon 3
<Ascendant> which sets +R on every channel lol

<Armageddon> He was on
<Armageddon> like

<GhostX> ah
<GhostX> does he get on daily?
<Armageddon> used to
<GhostX> or just randomly

<nickstr> or it seems that way
<nickstr> might as well junk it and get a Chrystler/Infinity radio from the same era
<junh1024-XD> wow, Framemaker 10 is already out
<nickstr> Google is turning up nothing
<nickstr> as usual

<Armageddon> the bouncer connects to the server
<Drake> 04oh
<Drake> 04Well
<Drake> 04why call him an idiot?
<Armageddon> and you connect to the bouncer
<Armageddon> and basically, when you disconnect, the bouncer stays online for as long as the bouncer server is online
<Armageddon> and can also replay logs to you
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> he literally has no intelligence
<Drake> 04Then...why bother?
<Drake> 04well
<Drake> 04if it's just a lack of knowledge

<ctr> Why doesn't it kick all of us?
<Nick> yeah but that time I was killed for saying it once

<Aristeo> 13 is the highest

<Aristeo> I've never seen anyone with a rune higher than 9 though
<Log1x> cashshop galore for 13 or?
<Nickario> actually reading the comments to his posts he's being trollol'd
<Log1x> what do the crystal chips do? im assuming its related to runes
<Aristeo> I heard an estimate that level 13 runes would cost $2,000 each
<Log1x> i think its in the rune section on the CS
<Log1x> thats pretty insane
<Aristeo> They help you make runes
<Log1x> i never played it but i knew Rappelz if you wanted to be viable end game and in pvp .. like TRUELY viable it was like $20k lol

<Spyrorocks> hey Stitch[Offline]
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, *
<Stormy> hi
<Spyrorocks> I see the good old spyroforum where everyone argues all day all the time is back :P
<Stormy> hah, yep
<Spyrorocks> Oh btw just so you know
<Spyrorocks> TTE and this other guy are doing some major stuff with the wiki
<Stormy> Wasn't TTE that guy who shut down SFA?
<Spyrorocks> yeah
<Spyrorocks> im also trying to get acces to sfa from him
<Spyrorocks> access*
<Spyrorocks> and bring it back up
<Spyrorocks> if possible.
<Stormy> hm, wasn't it just a proboards forum though?
<Spyrorocks> yeah
<Spyrorocks> but it was popular
<Spyrorocks> it also looks like darkspyro died down a bit.
<Stormy> But he died. He has virgins.
<Stormy> But they are all unwilling.....
<Stormy> LOL
<Rurik> 4:D
<Stormy> I went back there for a while
<Stormy> it pissed me off
<Stormy> too many teenagers who think trolling makes them cool
<Spyrorocks> I actually dont care too much about my old spyro stuff anymore.. just came back to have a checkup on things.
<Jason> what is spyro?
<Stormy> yeah
<Stormy> Jason http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyro_%28series%29
<Jason> :OO
<Jason> Iv played that
<Jason> just didnt know what it was called
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, watch this Ziamber guy
<Spyrorocks> i think hes trouble.
<Stormy> why?
<Stormy> I don't think I've ever seen him/her post
<Spyrorocks> hes posting bin laden gore pictures in profiles
<Spyrorocks> i sent him a warning
<Stormy> o.O
<Stormy> Okay...
<Spyrorocks> if he does it again and you notice just get rid of him.
<Stormy> sure
<Rurik> 4http://www.spyroforum.com/post-345607.html#345607 scroll up a bit
<Spyrorocks> looking at aceedwins posts make me want to get rid of him too.
<Stormy> lol, I don't blame you
<Stormy> he was already permabanned once and someone unbanned him.... I think it was RDX
<Rurik> 4go on last page for proof
<Spyrorocks> I might as well just ban everyone.
<Spyrorocks> :P
<Spyrorocks> Maybe for next april fools.
<Spyrorocks> or ill put up the fake "domain seized my fbi" thing.
<Stormy> XD
<Betowolf> update. I have the board now
<Betowolf> looks undamaged too
<Stormy> come to think of it, I can't think of a single person on that forum that I actually like
<Spyrorocks> so anyways what have you been up to
<Betowolf> so I'll be getting to work
<Stormy> homework, homework, and more homework

<lightumbreon> !Shipping
<Skylands> 4 lightumbreon is paired with drfsupercenter
<Stormy> played through bluetooth
<lightumbreon> ....
<lightumbreon> no comment
<Spyrorocks> you're already better than me.
<Stormy> i didn't write any of the bluetooth stuff though
<Stormy> just used the samples library
<Spyrorocks> I made a half assed music search thing
<Spyrorocks> that streams any song you type the name of
<Spyrorocks> its really ugly and hacky.
<lightumbreon> !Shipping
<Skylands> 4 lightumbreon is paired with Quanyails
<lightumbreon> :3
<Spyrorocks> ...and now i cant find the apk
<Spyrorocks> did you get an android phone?
<Stormy> no
<Stormy> still can't afford one
<Spyrorocks> Ive got an extra htc dream here
<Spyrorocks> but its too slow, you wouldnt want it
<Stormy> I wouldn't want it because it would cost me every month for the data plan
<Stormy> otherwise I'd take it
<Stormy> I'm finally getting my dad's old car this summer and it's already going to be a stretch to pay for the gas and insurance and everything
<lightumbreon> heya SS
<Spyrorocks> ah alright.
<Spyrorocks> I took my drivers test
<Spyrorocks> and failed.
<Stormy> ah, I failed my first one too
<Stormy> Actually I only just passed last summer
<Stormy> and had to pay an extra fee for being over 18
<Spyrorocks> what did you do to fail the first time
<Stormy> Um
<SilverSonic> Hi
<Stormy> Ran a stop sign, almost hit someone coming out of a parallel park...
<Spyrorocks> I sped through a park zone
<Stormy> basically I just got really nervous and screwed up everything
<Spyrorocks> probably happens to 90% of people.
<Spyrorocks> How long are your tests?
<Stormy> the whole thing probably takes about half an hour
<Spyrorocks> same here.
<Stormy> they just make you take a bunch of turns, 90 degree park, parallel park, and then you're done
<Spyrorocks> I also got "points" because i dont move my head enough
<Stormy> ah yeah
<Spyrorocks> when im "scanning" intersections
<Stormy> they probably thought you weren't looking in the mirrors
<Spyrorocks> yeah
<Spyrorocks> I dont actually use my mirrors that often so they'd be right :P
<Stormy> lol, that's a problem then :P
<Spyrorocks> I mean, I can probably drive fine
<Spyrorocks> if there wasnt some guy looking at me the whole time
<Stormy> yeah
<Spyrorocks> especially a tight ass british guy.
<Nickario> hi nightseas
<NightSeas> 12Hello Nick :3
<Spyrorocks> who calls me by my full name
<Stormy> lol
<Spyrorocks> and preappends my name to everything he says
<lightumbreon> heya GL
<Stormy> I had the same guy both times
<NightSeas> 12Hi lightumbreon
<Stormy> he remembered me from the first time and he remembered my brother and asked if I was related to him
<Spyrorocks> didyour brother pass the first time?
<Stormy> I was like "you must test hundreds of people, how did you remember me from a year ago?"
<Stormy> I think so
<Spyrorocks> I should just go up country to northern bc to a city with a population of 100 and do the test
<Stormy> he got it right when he turned 16
<HyperMetalLugia> Lul!
<lightumbreon> no swearing!
<lightumbreon> xD
<HyperMetalLugia> How is Lul swearing :P
<Spyrorocks> Id probably get some drunk native instructor
<Spyrorocks> I could give him a case of beer in exchange for passing me.
<lightumbreon> lul is dutch for d*ck
<Spyrorocks> oh well i figure ill pass it eventually
<Spyrorocks> i havent taken my second test anyways
<Stormy> it's a lot easier when you know what to expect
<Spyrorocks> yeah
<NightSeas> 12lol I did hear about how other languages have swear words too

<Angel_Espeon> 13and last week, said person actually appeared and joined my psychology class >>
<Espeon> 06I get the strangest cases of deja vu at times
<Spyrorocks> yeah he paid $3 and got the gun taken away
<Nickario> quick quesiton to the ppl on DA, do you think comments are just drying up?
<Espeon> 06Drying up?
<Nickario> like no one comments anymore?
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai world
<Angel_Espeon> 13I never got that many comments to begin with, but I do still get comments occasionally
<Nickario> just fave and not give a reason why? even then faves are a rarity even though an image gets viewed hundreds of times
<Nickario> well my most recent pic here http://nick-metroid.deviantart.com/#/d3fd6m4 has been up for a while, one of my best drawings ever (and the first I've done in months) yet it seems noone looks at it, same for my photography
<HyperMetalLugia> People are too afraid to post their public opinion of things without getting raged at by a random other since there is little free speech lefft
<HyperMetalLugia> -f
<HyperMetalLugia> DIE LUNA
<HyperMetalLugia> >:D
<Nickario> blacklatios who used to come here said in a journal and I had to agree, I don't think people actually use DA as a proper social site now, its just for viewing images (and stelaing it for their YT AMV's)
<Nickario> its like I've had 8 comments total the past two years now after submitting 30 new deviations
*Angel_Espeon has seen a few of her pictures being used in YT slideshows before

<Spyrorocks`> and a bit liberal for social services and stuff like that

<Spyrorocks`> stephen harper isnt very photogenic
<Stryker> Based solely on personality, I'd pick Palin before Trump.
<Spyrorocks`> what I dislike about the political system in canada is how the seats are distributed
<Stryker> I have no idea what the two would entail otherwise.
<Stryker> I just know we're screwed if either one ends up anywhere near office.
<Spyrorocks`> we need a representation by population distribution os seats

<Umbreon> 12i've heard of that myth
<Stryker> Yeah well. That isn't happening. :P
<Aristeo> Nope xD
<Chimera> Is it true :V
<Umbreon> 12has it ever been proven beyond a benefit of a doubt
<Stryker> I know this is old news, but it's bugging me again
<Stryker> http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-05-01-prop_n.htm
<Chimera> Idk
<Stryker> They're such freakin' babies about Prop 8.
<Chimera> Has it been proven false? :P
<Aristeo> Because if it did, he'd be able to figure out how to travel past the speed of light and colonize other galaxies
<Manlyguy> I never liked it to begin with. lol
<Chimera> Lul

<Kosovo> I'm more of a sprite person myself anyway
<Kosovo> same thing :P
<Stryker> Wouldn't a Catholic judge still have to hear a case about abortion?
<Kosovo> sierra mist IS awesome though
<Stryker> Nobody would complain about that.
<Umbreon> 12water is truely awesome
<Umbreon> 12it's how they did it many years ago
<holmes> evening.
<Aristeo> Hey
<Aristeo> Stryker: You know, I dunno.... I'm absolutely against LGBT discrimination of course, but I'm a little uncertain as to whether or not he should have recused
<Aristeo> but
<Manlyguy> I still prefer milk over anything, though.
<Stryker> Just because a person is straight, doesn't mean they won't have a bias either.
<Stryker> Everyone has a bias.
<Stryker> But I'm just cranky. >.>
<Aristeo> The legal standard is written more like whether someone could be percieved to have biases towards a case
<Aristeo> Where someone's "impartiality might be questioned" I think is the legal phrasing of it
<Aristeo> But
<Aristeo> I guess that's what appeals are for
<Curly> so, if a straight judge turned down turned down prop 8 would they yell about bias?
<Stryker> No.
<Stryker> He's straight!
<Stryker> So it's okay
<Curly> yeah, so that's retarded
<Stryker> I'm just angry about politics at the moment, Ari. So don't mind me. :P
<Aristeo> :3
*Curly goes back to lurking
<Stryker> It annoys me that religious people get so angry about gay marriage
*Aristeo hugs Curly
*Curly hugs
<Stryker> Marriage isn't strictly a religious thing.
<holmes> The thing is with that kind of stuff, you have to decide whether the judge has a PREFORMED opinion
<holmes> that's the main thing.
<Aristeo> Yeah
<holmes> Ideally all judges haven't even heard of the case before it goes to trial
<holmes> b/c then they're totally impartial
<Chimera> So like
<Chimera> Portal 2 came out
<Chimera> And it dominated.
<holmes> I assume I'm talking about the correct subject here
<holmes> I kinda jumped in.
<Chimera> Now we just need to stop calling Gabe Newell fat so he'll release Episode 3.
<Aristeo> I don't know anything about the case either and why it's held to be unconstitutional
<Manlyguy> Having played it yet. . -.
<holmes> Prop 8?
<Aristeo> Yeah
<Aristeo> I mean
<Aristeo> I know what it is
<Aristeo> But I don't know about the court history
<holmes> Pretty sure the legal basis was something along the lines of "there's no reason to do this"
*Aristeo often disagrees with the means but agrees with the ends with cases involving constitutionality in court
<holmes> as in it doesn't serve a legal purpose.
<holmes> as far as I could tell
<holmes> but hey let's talk about something less... controversial eh?
<Aristeo> State laws don't have to have a legal purpose, only federal laws :3
*Stryker growls.

<nickstr> that is great to hear

<drfsupercenter> 03we'll see
<drfsupercenter> 03it might be better, who knows
<junh1024-XD> it's still cut
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think that much was cut
<nickstr> to me it does not matter too much whether it was cut or not
<junh1024-XD> it's not much, but it is signifigant

<drfsupercenter> 03and the Blu-Ray is 5/7
<junh1024-XD> +L=Legend bit
<junh1024-XD> i uncut it, by best-matching the WOP, and recreating the speech from L
<junh1024-XD> lemme dig up my TA,
<nickstr> I saw a "restored" cut episode
<nickstr> I hated it
<junh1024-XD> i know which one ("james boobs")
<nickstr> it looked mutilated and horrible
<nickstr> I hate restore attempts for cuts
<nickstr> because most of the time they don't work
<junh1024-XD> not all restores are done equal.
<junh1024-XD> http://www.megaupload.com/?d=DR791EXP < drf, you can see/listen how i did it.
<junh1024-XD> i made uncut for M4. drf has it.

<nickstr> please
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03downloading
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm going to bed
<junh1024-XD> the cut scenes were all narration-based, so you shouldn't be umm, upset over it.
<junh1024-XD> unlike "james-boobies" one.
<nickstr> we will see
<nickstr> just make sure your edits are smooth and seamless
<nickstr> then it will be fine
<nickstr> no obvious color or source changes
<junh1024-XD> the WOP-sorta can't. L i can. I did do some colour-correction tho (mb a bit strong)
<nickstr> the PocketMonsters restore of Beauty and the Beach was just botched badly
<junh1024-XD> & a music edit at the start (MPM specialedit) & the end (you & me & pokemon)
<nickstr> don't restore those
<nickstr> or if you do put in the original unedited, undoctored English language track as a dual audio secondary track
<junh1024-XD> i did hybrid/that for M12
<nickstr> its not much to ask
<junh1024-XD> when i started encoding, i did consider that, because it's more information. but later, as i developed tastes for pokemon music, i put songs i liked instead (also, some people like j-music better)

<nickstr> I sure hope that router was WIFI or ethernet
<nickstr> and not...
<nickstr> EWW POWERLINE NETWORKING
<eXAKR> Why EW powerline networking?
<nickstr> its a bad technology over all
<nickstr> it causes severe interference for one
<eXAKR> How?
<nickstr> it uses the HF (high frequency) radio spectrum over household wiring which was not designed to carry RF and thus not shielded appropriately
<nickstr> the signals it uses leak out of the lines and can travel up to several hundred feet
<eXAKR> hmmm
<nickstr> not to mention amateur radio operators or others operating legally on the HF spectrum can kill your network simply by transmitting
<nickstr> if they are at close range

<drfsupercenter> 03still
<drfsupercenter> 03and sadly my sister is going to have to get a Dell for college x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03since it's the only thing they'll do service on if it breaks
<HyperMetalLugia> Baww, I have a Lenovo T410i (inb4 ew)
<drfsupercenter> 03and she's not good with computers so I want to set her up with something she can get fixed when she breaks it
<drfsupercenter> 03yes when, not if

<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm all HOW THE FRICK DID YOUG ET THAT
<drfsupercenter> 03because they don't download stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03though I think giving them Ad Muncher was possibly the best decision ever
<HyperMetalLugia> Which is why I let the rest of my family use the slow and nearly dead Vista PC :D

<Charles> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102909
<Charles> both are high end, but I think the latter is more effective at staying cool
<Things> I've got the 4890
<Things> Staying cool is not a option
<Things> >.>
<Ascendant> goodnight
<Charles> of course it is, I think each subsequent series is better at not turning into a space heater
<lightumbreon> Nighties Ascendant
<Charles> we REALLY need to get more people in here, it is too quiet
<VampirePrincess> well i'm trying.
<VampirePrincess> rockjaemz was my older bro.
<VampirePrincess> he lives in GA.
<Charles> I'll prolly get my gf to hang out here since she has just as little of a life as I do
<VampirePrincess> cool
<VampirePrincess> erm about the 1st part...
<Charles> ?
<VampirePrincess> about the 1st part... Charles> I'll prolly get my gf to hang out here
<VampirePrincess> lol
<Charles> what about it?
<Charles> lol
<VampirePrincess> 08:53 <VampirePrincess> cool
<VampirePrincess> lol
<Charles> oh, lol, k
<VampirePrincess> lolol
<VampirePrincess> its too quiet in here.
<Charles> well, we just need a good topic. what interests us?
<VampirePrincess> lol. vamps and zombies?
<VampirePrincess> :)
<Charles> k.
<Charles> hmm, it is fairly straightforward when creating a Zombie plan, but I would imagin it would be a lot more difficult to create a Vamp plan
<VampirePrincess> not really.
<Charles> Well, vamps are intelligent, harder to kill, and excellent hunters at night
<VampirePrincess> well, not when you read every vamp book that u can lay ur hands on.
<VampirePrincess> :)
<Charles> meaning your mobility would be restricted to the daylight hours, an even then they might be able to track you if enough of em are looking out of windows during the day
<Charles> your only hope would be to get to a nice tropical island more than 200 miles from the nearest main body of land, hunt down and kill everything that is undead during the day, and restrict your living spaces to the center of the island
<Charles> No fires at night, and all fires should be extinguished at least 2 hours before nightfall
<VampirePrincess> not necessarily.
*VampirePrincess smirks
<Charles> ok, what is your plan?
<VampirePrincess> i'm a writer. i can create my own species vamp.
<VampirePrincess> :)
<VampirePrincess> my vamps are like nocturnal animals, its more comfortable to go around only at night, but not impossible.
<VampirePrincess> and we DONT sparkle
<Charles> pfft, I am going off of the basics of Vamps :Immortal, harmed by sunlight, great night vision and sense of smell, and super speedy and strong
<VampirePrincess> lol the only diff to my species in the light thing. everything else is the same.
<Charles> right, meaning same mobility restrictions would apply
<VampirePrincess> vamps can run fast, wheres the mobility restrictions?
<Charles> also, on your island, you would want to do what the Vietcong did and make a spidey hole that leads to an underground sleeping area
<Charles> the mobility restrictions I am talking about applies to human survivors
<Charles> I am talking about a Vampire Survival plan
<VampirePrincess> i leave no survors.
<VampirePrincess> survivors*
<Charles> I would survive
<VampirePrincess> vamp survival plan, be a nomad - kill the prey - blend in with populations - know how to fight.
<Charles> Human Survival Plan: Flee the undead, Lop off their heads when you have to fight, get away from the mainland
<Charles> lopping off their heads, while it may not kill them, will most certainly hinder their ability to come after you
<Charles> never did understand how a vamp can function after a bullet to the head though
<Charles> I mean, they most certainly retain their intelligence, meaning their brain is still active, so any trauma to it would affect a vamp
<Charles> k, gonna play some games, bbl
<VampirePrincess> lol, vamps can swim.
<VampirePrincess> stake thru the heart. or rip and burn.
<VampirePrincess> thts the only ways i know of
<Charles> right,but if you lop off their heads, they will lose most, if not all control of their body

<eXAKR> Finally
<eXAKR> You admit you are fat
<Lakorv> I know I accuse Americans of having a horrible fantasy when it comes to place names
<eXAKR> Stop eating fast food
<drfsupercenter> 03eXAKR I've never denied it
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't like when people call me fat
<eXAKR> Then suddenly you will be thin
<Lakorv> but the Digimon creators sure didn't have much creativity either.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like how retarded people hate when people call them retarded
<drfsupercenter> 03only I can insult myself :P
*eXAKR slaps drfsupercenter with Ozzy Osbourne

<eXAKR> Relax will ya
<eXAKR> ?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03ownership scripts are just annoying >_>
<eXAKR> ...
<Chimera> 04hi
<eXAKR> Hi
<Lakorv> I thought this was the sillychannel?
<drfsupercenter> 03it is, but going !everyone just looks stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03especially when people know darn well most people don't ahve those scripts.
<eXAKR> drf, loosen up
<Lakorv> I don't see the problem
<Lakorv> half of what's said here is just as interesting as the !<name> lines anyway.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's a matter of opinion
<Lakorv> as is your statement.
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said it wasn;t
<eXAKR> !espeon !umbreon !leafeon !chimera
*Espeon now belongs to eXAKR for 6 minutes
*Umbreon still belongs to eXAKR for 5 more minutes
*Chimera still belongs to eXAKR for 4 more minutes
*Leafeon still belongs to eXAKR for 10 more minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03see, was that really necessary?
<Lakorv> also, who didn't have them?
<drfsupercenter> 03everyone but those 4?
<eXAKR> This isn't a serious chat you know
<eXAKR> Loosen up
<eXAKR> You can set up #serious if you want to
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't mind sillyness now and then but you also abuse scripts quite a lot
<lightumbreon|Gaming> |!eXAKR
*eXAKR now belongs to lightumbreon|Gaming for 14 minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03like when you do !pokemon 28 times in a row until you get one of only four(!) that youw ant
<eXAKR> ...
<Lakorv> I thought TST was a laid-back and for-fun thing, not a srsbsns thing.
<eXAKR> You know me as the script abuser
<eXAKR> Everyone knows that
<Leafeon> nofunallowed.jpg
<Leafeon> kby
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it's also the fact that by doing !name, you're triggering any potential nick alerts that people have set up and I don't think people appreciate when you do that when they intentionally don't have a script for that reason
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (nickstr10) 11WB10»11•. 10- G inji: THIS IS SPARTA, MICHIGAN // ***inji lides // nickstr: IDE, IDE // nickstr: THIS IS SATA!
<eXAKR> But then without doing that I won't ever know who has or got a script
<eXAKR> Like !leafeon
*Leafeon now belongs to eXAKR for 11 minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but you do it all the time
<eXAKR> Though I understand the annoying part
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like those people who type !espeon without even checking if Espeon is on the channel
*Espeon still belongs to eXAKR for 2 more minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03it just makes them look like an idiot
<Leafeon> i really don't care about nickalerts
<Leafeon> no sounds, i only find out when i check mIRC
<drfsupercenter> 03neither do I, but some people do
<eXAKR> Sigh drf, ever since you took over the chat this place now feels too strict
<drfsupercenter> 03I have them completely disabled. I think they're stupid.
*Lakorv cares slightly, but goes by the philosophy of 'rather one too many than one too few'.
<Leafeon> meh
<Leafeon> when i'm actually on mIRC and someone is trying to get my attention i find it helpful
<drfsupercenter> 03I never took over the chat
<Leafeon> but i idle in 3 or 4 different networks usually
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm only ever on two networks, and only two truly active channels
<drfsupercenter> 03so I have a 50/50% chance of seeing it anyway :P
<Espeon> 06opinions everywhere
<Espeon> 06and now I vanish again
<L[a]korv> hade Espeon
<Dialga> k
<drfsupercenter> 03hade?
<Chimera> 04hi
<eXAKR> I'm on five different servers
<eXAKR> One is pretty serious
<eXAKR> A desktop skinning commuinity
<eXAKR> And I know never to do such things there because people will get annoyed
<eXAKR> But here? Meh
<drfsupercenter> 03and seriously, if you think I'm bad, you should try #RawkSD
<drfsupercenter> 03they banned me because they hate me
<eXAKR> I thought we are more relaxed about such stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate elitist circlejerk groups
<drfsupercenter> 03eXAKR, let me just put it this way
<eXAKR> #RawkSD is #RawkSD, #silverwings is #silverwings
<eXAKR> !list
<drfsupercenter> 03I get as annoyed with you trying to nick-trigger everyone on the channel as people do with me saying EW APPLE all the time./
<eXAKR> ...
<eXAKR> Throw in your hate of 5th gen
<drfsupercenter> 03same idea.
<eXAKR> The only justified one so far was the Black City/White Forest thing
<eXAKR> then that off-topic here
<eXAKR> *that's
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<eXAKR> Either way
<eXAKR> People do annoying stuff here from time to time
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<eXAKR> As long as it's not all the time, people tolerate it
<eXAKR> I don't spam all the time
<eXAKR> Notice how much I idle?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<eXAKR> But whenever people talk about Apple, or 5th gen Pokémon, you start ewwing
<eXAKR> almost every time thus far as I have seen
<drfsupercenter> 03whenever you;'re here you start nicktriggering
<drfsupercenter> 03how is there a difference
<drfsupercenter> 03bottom line here is that people get annoyed at silly things :P
<Espeon> 06Yes. And if one side "must just deal with it otherwise they're oversensitive" then that goes for everyone. And that's all I have to say (again) about it.
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said I was *offended* by it
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the difference with that one
<Espeon> 06Well getting offended by any of the things brought up is rather silly, but annoyance is something that can't be annoyed. Only way to make sure no one is annoyed is to literally go #nofunallowed =P. So a balance of things, I guess.
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm gonna go run a couple errands
<drfsupercenter> 03so bbl
<Espeon> 06Alright~
<RoxFox64[Cheese]> I'm making cheese!
<lightumbreon|Gaming> heya Hawkie /LATE
<eXAKR> drf
<eXAKR> All I can tell you at this moment is
<eXAKR> Loosen up
<eXAKR> And don't be annoying
<eXAKR> People have the right to scriptspam a bit
<eXAKR> Talk about Apple stuff
<eXAKR> and 5th gen Pokémon
<eXAKR> As long as it's not something like
<eXAKR> As long as it's not something like
<eXAKR> As long as it's not something like
<eXAKR> As long as it's not something like

<Espeon> 06then it should be okay :B
<eXAKR> Or when it's in the middle of someone's chat or something
<eXAKR> Just learn to accept it
<eXAKR> This != seriouschat
<L[a]korv> Espeon: even better if the person accused /is/ gay - what insult would it be then? :P
<eXAKR> :P
<eXAKR> !espeon !umbreon !leafeon !chimera
*Espeon now belongs to eXAKR for 17 minutes
*Umbreon now belongs to eXAKR for 7 minutes
*Chimera now belongs to eXAKR for 3 minutes
<L[a]korv> 'You're gay!' 'Yeah, your problem?'
<L[a]korv> oh
<L[a]korv> and drf|away
<L[a]korv> how about /ignore -levels msg -channel #silverwings -regexp *belongs to*?
<Espeon> 06I know Lakorv, I actually instantly think someone must have a small vocabulary when someone uses it as an insult, but just to make my example more realistic in a way - as a lot of people do think it's the best insult evar besides their yo momma jokes~
<Espeon> 06Silly people
<Lakorv> haha
<Lakorv> you should meet my parallel class
<Espeon> 06In fact, just saying "Yes, I'm g6ay" quite often leads to hilarious results...
<Espeon> 06And oh? o.o
<Lakorv> they yell 'you're gay' and '<censored>' at eachother all the time
<Espeon> 06Lol.
<Lakorv> why, thanks
<Lakorv> I see that holding an intellectual conversation is really convenient in this channel.
<eXAKR> lol
<Lakorv> did my line get through?
<Espeon> 06Yeah xD
<Lakorv> okay
<Lakorv> well, the point is they don't consider it demeaning
<Espeon> 06Some kind of joke or something? o.o
<Lakorv> their default reply is 'And I like it!'
<Espeon> 06Ahaha
<Lakorv> and by statistics, at least 60-90% of that class should be straight
<Lakorv> :P
<Lakorv> I asked my friend it the class to describe their class in one word
<Lakorv> 'homophile?'
<nickstr> I never heard of that
<nickstr> I heard of homophobe
<Lakorv> oh
<nickstr> but not that
<Espeon> 06lolnorwegian
<Lakorv> it's synonymous with 'homosexual'
<Hawkie> 07LOL
<Hawkie> 07Lakorv
<Hawkie> 07i adore you
<Lakorv> except
<Hawkie> 07also
<Espeon> 06But probably not used that much internationally I guess o.o
<Hawkie> 07fail swearing script is fail
<Lakorv> literally, it means 'attracted to the same'
<Lakorv> whereas 'homosexual' means 'sexually attracted to the same'
<Lakorv> same difference.
<Lakorv> Hawkie: what did I do now <.<
<Hawkie> 07^^
<Hawkie> 07exist?
*Hawkie snugs lakorv

<lightumbreon> i meant: UBËR
<lightumbreon> xD
<Lakorv> But I can live with your version, too.
<Lakorv> lightumbreon: it's über
<Lakorv> German for 'over'.
<lightumbreon> i know, but it has more meanings than one :P
<Lakorv> hm?
*eXAKR snuggles the floof </late>

<Hawkie> 07Well Timey can go floof in a corner.
<Hawkie> 07He asked, I answered
<Lakorv> :>
<Hawkie> 07I just find he's full of contradictions sometimes
<Hawkie> 07I mean... he once praised me for my honesty.
<Hawkie> 07Now then, regarding this
<Hawkie> 07he doesn't like it! lol.
<Lakorv> it's easier to be big in words than big in action.
<Hawkie> 07True.
<Hawkie> 07well that said
<Lakorv> it's easy to say things you'd like to think are true.
<Hawkie> 07Mhm...
<Hawkie> 07well considering he has reminded me of an older version of the peregrine
<Hawkie> 07and because of a convo I had earlier today
<Hawkie> 07this does not surprise me.
<Hawkie> 07he also was like that
<Hawkie> 07said things, then contradicted them
<Hawkie> 07timey is just tons more subtle about it. :p
*Hawkie is used to it though. . . .
*Hawkie does believe she gets along with most people. Or, she would. That might change.
<Hawkie> 07Once I become more confident, I don't think everyone will like me as much
<Hawkie> 07Because I simply won't adapt as much as I used to, to replicate and mirror in order to be more likeable. o3o

<Lakorv> Rainmakers
<Lakorv> they were a curious band
<Lakorv> mostly popular in Scandinavia, especially Norway
<Lakorv> but were from elsewhere somewhere.
<Hawkie> 07ah
<Hawkie> 07never heard of them

<drfsupercenter> 03LOOOL @ this
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom and I kept hearing what sounded like a bird, right
<drfsupercenter> 03and my momw as like "it's too loud to be outside... it's probably trapped in our house soemwhere"
<drfsupercenter> 03so when I was out running errands, my mom was looking around the house
<drfsupercenter> 03turns out
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<drfsupercenter> 03my sister has her AIM/Skype/whatever set to make a bird tweeting sound when she gets an I<
<drfsupercenter> 03*IM
<drfsupercenter> 03and it sounds so real it fooled the both of us
<HyperMetalLugia> Tweets XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like LOL I can't believe that
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh the puns x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03and this is why turning your speakers off when you aren't at the computer is good
<Aristeo> Sally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<drfsupercenter> 03or better yet, signing out of IM when you aren't on o.o
<Aristeo> HAPPY BIRTHDAY SALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<Charles> lol
<Sally> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<Sally> Thank you ari :)
<HyperMetalLugia> I can't believe she would do such s thing
<HyperMetalLugia> Take her phone and add you saying "EW BIRDS" to it
<Sally> charles i has to show u the awesomeness
<Aristeo> Now you can legally by cigarettes :D
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said EW BIRDS
<drfsupercenter> 03I have no problems with the
<drfsupercenter> 03m
<drfsupercenter> 03I'
<Lakorv> this is why you don't use environmental sounds for notifications.
<HyperMetalLugia> Until now
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just not a fanatic like some people here
<Aristeo> And you're at the age of consent in every state in the U.S.
<Sally> lol yeah, ik. my friend was trying to get me to smoke with her
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL, I don't use *any* sounds for IM programs
<drfsupercenter> 03it's really obnoxious
<Aristeo> And
<Sally> lol
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Hawkie> 07and
<Aristeo> I'm not sure what else
<Sally> sisi
<drfsupercenter> 03to hear stupid binging noises every 2 seconds
<Hawkie> 07then there were
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Hawkie> 07peadges
<drfsupercenter> 03especially since my sister is a social magnet
*Hawkie chews on HyperMetalLugia
<Lakorv> sounds are fine for the uses they suit.
<drfsupercenter> 03with like 800 friends on AIM
<Aristeo> You can sign contracts
*HyperMetalLugia is chewed on
<drfsupercenter> 03you have any idea how annoying that is?
<Lakorv> I, personally, don't use them.
<Sally> yay contracts
<drfsupercenter> 03hearing those noises that often?
<Hawkie> 07Haha
<Lakorv> I use visual feedback and popups.
<Hawkie> 07I like IM sounds
<Hawkie> 07but
<Hawkie> 07they can get insane
<Hawkie> 07because whenever I sign on somewhere
<drfsupercenter> 03I literally don't use anything
<drfsupercenter> 03if I get an IM, the IM window opens, that's all
<Hawkie> 07I get like 3+ people IMing me within the minute
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Hawkie> 07so it's like
<Hawkie> 07aaah sounds
<drfsupercenter> 03with MSN it makes the taskbar icon flash colors
<Hawkie> 07nbut
<Hawkie> 07If I dont have them
<Jason> Sally:
<Jason> Sally:
<Hawkie> 07I dont notice anyone
<Jason> Sally:
<Jason> Sally:
<Jason> Sally:
<Hawkie> 07=p
<Jason> Sally:
<Jason> Sally:
<Hawkie> 07so its like
<drfsupercenter> 03the window doesn't pop up?
<Hawkie> 07sounds = response
<Hawkie> 07nou
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03that's... odd
<Sally> ya?
<Jason> HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
*Hawkie floofs on Lakorv
<Lakorv> there's no 'popping up' for my irc either
*Jason noms Sally
<Sally> lol, thank you (:
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said IRC
<drfsupercenter> 03I said instant messaging
*Jason throws Sally in the air
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't consider IRC to be IM, it's a chatroom protocol :P
<Jason> :D
*Sally dies
<Lakorv> you're trying to sound smart
<Jason> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03so you're saying I'm not?
<drfsupercenter> 03D:"
<Lakorv> but you ruined it with the word 'chatroom protocol'
*Jason revives Sally
<Hawkie> 07o3o...
*Hawkie chews on irc.
<Jason> Sally: You want to smoke with me?
<drfsupercenter> 03but IRC *is* a chatroom protocol, is it not?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just stating facts :P
<Lakorv> the hell is a chatroom
<Jason> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03American term
<Lakorv> no
<drfsupercenter> 03IRC channels are chatrooms
<Lakorv> irc is not a room
<drfsupercenter> 03orly
<Lakorv> you're talking about channels
<drfsupercenter> 03then why is there an iPhone (EW) app for chatting on IRC called Rooms? :OP
<drfsupercenter> 03*:P
<Lakorv> furthermore, it's not a channel protocol
<Lakorv> it's a relayed text-over-ip protocol
<drfsupercenter> 03which, in layman's terms, is chat
<Lakorv> yes
<drfsupercenter> 03minus the word rooms if you want, that's a more Americanized term :P
<Lakorv> relayed chat.
<Sally> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03hence the name.
<Sally> nawp
<Lakorv> the room part has no home in the protocol definition.
<Jason> WHY NOT??
<Hawkie> 07yeh but ... it's not technically a room then
<Hawkie> 07o_O
<Lakorv> there is no such thing as a 'chatroom protocol'
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> !define chatroom
<[TST]Bot> -!- chat room: a site on the internet where a number of users can communicate in real time (typically one dedicated to a particular topic)
<drfsupercenter> 03is that not what IRC is?
<Sally> cuz hubby dont want me to
<Jason> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03minus the word site
<Hawkie> 07a site on the internet o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03that's kinda a stupid definition
<Jason> Sally: What is yer birthday wish?
<drfsupercenter> 03get rid of "a site"
<drfsupercenter> 03other than that, is that not what IRC is? :P
<Sally> that i could move out
<Sally> lol
<Jason> :Oo
<Lakorv> chat room: a room wherein people talk together.
<Jason> Something that I can do
<drfsupercenter> 03more or less, which is what IRC is
<drfsupercenter> 03I realize it can be used for other things too
<HyperMetalLugia> Zac Efron = Romeo? </random>
<Lakorv> popular contemporary usage contains strong conotations to digitalism.
<lightumbreon> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's PRIMARILY used for chatting
<Hawkie> 07No because irc isn't a 'room' per se o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03EW ZAC EFRON
<HyperMetalLugia> I know XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well channels = rooms
<Lakorv> no.
<Hawkie> 07No.
<Hawkie> 07... LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<Hawkie> 07I was one second too late.
<Hawkie> 07fjfs
<drfsupercenter> 03you're arguing with a native English speaker here :P
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: the hell
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah ;o
<drfsupercenter> 03you probably just have a different term for it
<drfsupercenter> 03in Norwegian
<drfsupercenter> 03or something
<Hawkie> 07drfsupercenter, you didn't go into technical terms though
<Hawkie> 07o_O
<Lakorv> I've had a native English speaker tell me
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<Lakorv> that English came from Latin
<drfsupercenter> 03English is just a weird language
<Lakorv> now that must surely be correct since she was native?
<drfsupercenter> 03it came from everywhere
<Lakorv> nor did it do that.
<drfsupercenter> 03orly
<Hawkie> 07DRF
<drfsupercenter> 03English words come from just about every language
*Jason pokes the Sally
<Hawkie> 07you're not using your words precisely.
<Hawkie> 07so
<Hawkie> 07moot arguments really.
<HyperMetalLugia> sala de chat is better :P
<Hawkie> 07o_O
<Sally> umz
<Hawkie> 07LOL HyperMetalLugia
<Sally> idk
<Hawkie> 07Spanish.
<Jason> gimme a sec
<Lakorv> English develloped on the basis of the Germanic Anglo-Saxian language
<Lakorv> later it was influenced by the French
<drfsupercenter> 03yes but there are words in English that come from many languages
<drfsupercenter> 03like almost everything out there
<Lakorv> also, Norsemen.
<HyperMetalLugia> Like Tacos *nod*
<Hawkie> 07So the above-mentioned -> everywhere?
<Hawkie> 07o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: by your definition, every language out there stems from English.
<drfsupercenter> 03I meant more like "llama"
<drfsupercenter> 03the animal
<Jason> damnit
<drfsupercenter> 03which also comes from Spanish
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Jason> cool whip is gone
<Hawkie> 07insofar I know
<Jason> have to come up with a new idea
<Hawkie> 07those areas
<Hawkie> 07arent everywhere
<drfsupercenter> 03Lakorv, more like the reverse
<drfsupercenter> 03English stems from every language
<drfsupercenter> 03more or less
<drfsupercenter> 03it may be developed off one or another but in today's day and age, words in the ENglish language come from everything
<Sally> <...<
<Sally> file:///C:/Users/Breizy44/Downloads/Photo1715.jpg
<Lakorv> by your definition
<Lakorv> every language which includes an English word
<Lakorv> would stem from English.
*Sally pokes Aristeo
<Hawkie> 07o3o...
<Aristeo> :o
*HyperMetalLugia thinks paradox
<drfsupercenter> 03You sure enjoy picking my sentences apart, don't you
*Hawkie curls up next to Lakorv
<Hawkie> 07drfsupercenter
<Aristeo> I can't see it, that file is on your computer
<Lakorv> English in itself came from Anglo-Saxian, French and Norse.
<Hawkie> 07your imprecise language allows such to happen.
<Hawkie> 07and
<Sally> Remember that girl on my friends list you were creeping on?
<Sally> aaaw pooo
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL imprecise
<Hawkie> 07your arguments have little substance to them
<Hawkie> 07Indeedu
<Aristeo> Yes I remember her :3
<Lakorv> the vocab has however been expanded by means of words from many other languages.
<Aristeo> ... I think
<Aristeo> I creeped on a bunch of htem
<Hawkie> 07because it's such a loosely structured sentence/content.
<Sally> her name is katy
<Hawkie> 07and hmn
<drfsupercenter> 03didn't we just have a discussion earlier about how this channel isn't meant to be very serious?
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03so of course I'm not going to go around talking like I';m a dictionary
<Hawkie> 07lol, well so why
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: I'm not yelling, nor accusing.
<Hawkie> 07are you complaining?
<Hawkie> 07^--
<Hawkie> 07this
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said yelling or accusing
<Aristeo> I think so
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03I said picking my sentences apart
<Aristeo> The one looking for a fwb?
<Jason> Sally: xD You really thought he could look on yer C drive?
<Lakorv> so where is the problem?
<Jason> unless you install apache or something..
<drfsupercenter> 03did I say it was a problem?
*Aristeo likes where this conversation is headed
<Hawkie> 07it does have some negative connotations.
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Hawkie> 07when you
<Sally> o.O u know i know nothing of compies
<Lakorv> 23:12:20 %drfsupercenter: didn't we just have a discussion earlier about how this channel isn't meant to be very serious?
<Hawkie> 07said it like this.
<Lakorv> there?
<Sally> lol no
<Sally> Aristeo, it not like that lol.
<Sally> she just made something and then let me have it and it is awesomeness
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said yelling or accusing in that sentence either.
<Stormy> lol Jason, I used be the same way :P
<Lakorv> no, so where is the problem?
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said I had ap roblem
<drfsupercenter> 03+space -space
<Lakorv> got a thing against intellectual arguments?
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<HyperMetalLugia> !space
<eXAKR> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!!
<HyperMetalLugia> .x.
<Jason> Stormy: xD what, the posting of your C drive path and thinking people can look at it?
<drfsupercenter> 03and at least Hawkie is acknowleging my prescence :P
<Hawkie> 07LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03so that's a start
<Hawkie> 07eXAKR
<Stormy> Yep XD
<Hawkie> 07well
<Jason> lolll

<Dialga> blah
<Hawkie> 07you make me really want to
<HyperMetalLugia> ;<
<HyperMetalLugia> Who
<Hawkie> 07because you're making a big deal out of it!
<Jason> When you get a linux server
<Stormy> Actually I probably didn't even know you could get that path name from anywhere...
<Jason> or a linux comp, everything changes.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah, you
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Hawkie> 07hi
<Sally> There ari, i sent it to ya.
<XD001> hi damos
<Hawkie> 07Damosssss.
<drfsupercenter> 03meh I don't feel like explaining it on here.
<Aristeo> So my friend accidentally sent me an album of her nekkid pics
<Sally> lolz
<Stormy> "How do I get this picture online?" "You upload it." "...What?"
<Sally> bet it wasnt an accident
<drfsupercenter> 03let's just say with all the crap I've had go on in my life, having one less person ignore me is a major accomplishment, which is why I'm making a big deal out of it/ o.o
<Aristeo> No it wasn't
<Aristeo> I mean
<Hawkie> 07then don't. But just stop making somekind of deal out of it really..
<Hawkie> 07well
<Sally> xP
<Aristeo> They were all online anyway
<Jason> Stormy: xD
<Hawkie> 07I have made my stance clear.
<Lakorv> well, you've been making quite a deal out of it when she /was/ ignoring you, too.
<Sally> :O
<Sally> Hai Stormy :)
<drfsupercenter> 03yes I know Lakorv, we've all done things we aren't proud of, let's let the past be past, k?
<Sally> and shawt up Jason
<drfsupercenter> 03I just like when you actually reply to me, rather than acting like I don't exist.
<Stormy> Then I would save the image in .bmp format and wonder why the upload wouldn't work. XD
<Stormy> Hey Sally
<Jason> Stormy: I run an apache server in my comp, so I can just click and drag into that folder and then people can see it
<Jason> Stormy: xD, glad you figured it out now
<Stormy> Yeah, haha
<drfsupercenter> 03xD, I'm having a discussion about the ending of Portal 2 in another channel
<Jason> :P
<Stormy> this is when I was like 14
<Stormy> On my first forum
<Stormy> :P
<Jason> Stormy: I am 15 xD
<Stormy> LOL
<Lakorv> seeing as how it was pointed out to you, and you'd still make a point out of it, I'd put your regret to question, but I don't feel like keeping this going.
<Stormy> ...I didn't even start using the internet until 14, OK? :P
<Jason> How old are you now
<Jason> ?
<Stormy> 20
<Jason> Oh
<Jason> Hmm
<Jason> girl or guy?
<Sally> jeebus stormy
<Stormy> girl
<Sally> jooh old
<Sally> :P
<Hawkie> 07I just think you're rather unpleasant. Either way you're being mean, me acknowledging you or not.
<Stormy> yeah I know lol
<Hawkie> 07Until you get your way. The difference is ... strikingly little.
<Hawkie> 07Anyway
<Jason> xD
*Sally is going to stay 18 forever
<Hawkie> 07I don't feel like carrying this discussion any further, either
<Jason> Stormy: Thats explains it
<drfsupercenter> 03I fail to see how I'm being mean but I don't need to go into it.
<Hawkie> 07I's going to do other things
<Stormy> how old are you, Jason/Sally?
<drfsupercenter> 03since you clearly don't want to
<Hawkie> 07Why should I want to?
<Stormy> Wait no
<Stormy> Jason's 15
<Sally> :P
<Charles> she just turned 24

<Sally> i mean... ya, i am totally 24 >...>
<EccoCode> Good evening Hawkie, ^^
<Charles> Sorry Sally, I know you thought you turned 18 this morning, but when you went to bed, you did not wake up till a few years later
<Hawkie> 07How are you?
<Stormy> Aristeo, you totally stole what I was going to say ;___;
<Sally> :O
<Sally> zomg
<Sally> oh man, i missed so much.
<drfsupercenter> 03ugh
<drfsupercenter> 03why is this KVM switch not working as it should
<Aristeo> What do you mean?
<Charles> not really
<Lakorv> because it's KVM.
<Sally> yes huh
<Jason> :OO
<EccoCode> I am a little tiered, been studying for most of the day for my last final exam that I have tomorrow.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Lakorv> have fun.
<Charles> I am still talking to you from 1 hour in the future
<drfsupercenter> 03what would you suggest instead then
<EccoCode> How are you today?
<Sally> :O
<drfsupercenter> 03having two computers using one set of keyboard/mouse
<Hawkie> 07good luck EccoCode!
<Hawkie> 07I'm icky

<Sally> heeey.... do they have chipotlez in the future?
<Hawkie> 07^v^
<Aristeo> I feel like i missed a lot too sometimes
*Hawkie excess floofs on Lakorv
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, luckily the second computer is just a machine I built for like $200 to record TV onto
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: I'm using 3 monitors, 2 computers, 1 touchpad and 1 keyboard at the very moment.
<drfsupercenter> 03but I still need to be able to control it
<Lakorv> have fun.
<Hawkie> 07I define physically being okay as different from being emotionally okay XD
<Lakorv> like I said
<Charles> they do, but it is now considered healthfood
<drfsupercenter> 03Lakorv, how do you change between computers then
<drfsupercenter> 03if you aren't using a siwtch
<Sally> noice
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: virtual bridge over lan.
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03is that like VNC?
<EccoCode> Thank you Hawkie and hope you get to feeling physically better soon. (I hope I got that right, ^^;; x_x)
<Lakorv> no.
<Hawkie> 07thanks!
<Lakorv> 23:20:39 Lakorv: have fun.
*Hawkie huggles EccoCode
<Jason> Stormy: xD If you look at my server, you will get soo confizzled, there are like a billion files, but they are all like 1KB in size
<Hawkie> 07Lol Lakorv.....
*EccoCode hugs Hawkie back, ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03hey, I was just asking for help, but whatever
*Hawkie cuddles the raven happily
<Stormy> haha
<Lakorv> oh, you were?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm curious how you can do it without using a KVM switch
<Lakorv> sorry, I didn't see any question for help there.
<Stormy> what do you use it for, just uploading stuff?
<Jason> seedbox
<drfsupercenter> 03I forgot to type a ?
<Jason> web server
<Jason> irc server
<Stormy> Ah
<Lakorv> no
<Jason> IRC client
<Stormy> (What's a seedbox?)
<Lakorv> you asked 'how' and 'is it like'
<Lakorv> I answered both.
<drfsupercenter> 03um OK
<Hawkie> 07=P
<drfsupercenter> 03but the pasting the "have fun" comment made it clear you didn't want to help me
<Jason> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox
<drfsupercenter> 03anywho I'm guessing it's not possible to do that using Windows?
<Lakorv> of course it is.
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Stormy> Oh, OK
<Jason> Yeah
<Lakorv> networking is kind of cross-platform.
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, I can use TeamViewer to control the other computer but that seems silly when it's right next to me
<Stormy> blarg
<drfsupercenter> 03I've got two monitors, both hooked up to my primary desktop. The KVM switch controls the right monitor (which is VGA) so I can use it with the second one, but then that locks me out of using the other
<drfsupercenter> 03since it unplugs the mouse/keyboard from the other machine x.x
*Hawkie squishes Lakorv
<Stormy> I should work on my android app, but I reaaaaly don't want to
<Hawkie> 07silly floofs
<Jason> me h
<Sally> :O
<Hawkie> 07^-^
<Sally> totes my word
<Jason> Stormy: What does it do?
<Stormy> what, blarg?
<Stormy> that's RDX's word, Sally :P
<Espeon> 06oo
<Stormy> Jason: it's a checkers game
<Hawkie> 07Espeon!!!!!!!!!
<Hawkie> 07!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Hawkie for 15 minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows Update is so stupid at times
<Stormy> Played through bluetooth
*lightumbreon is off to bed
<lightumbreon> Gnite all
<drfsupercenter> 03I wish I could just be like "Install all over 9000 updates right now and stop bugging me"
<Hawkie> 07bai
<EccoCode> good night lightumbreon.
<Lakorv> nini lightumbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll install like 50 updates, then right after I reboot, more updates found
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like grr
<Jason> oh
<Jason> thats cool
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: it's Windows. Whatever did you expect.
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Sally> NAWP, Stormy i shwear, it is my word
<Sally> lol
<Jason> I dont have an android phone
<Stormy> it would be if I could get it working right >.<
<drfsupercenter> 03Ordinarily the updates are fine
<Stormy> Me either
<Jason> what phone do you have?
<Sally> *blargh* rather
<drfsupercenter> 03but when you build a new machine and install Windows 7 off a disc that's now over a year old, well... there's craptons of updates
<Stormy> I'm actually borrowing two devices from the school CS department
<Jason> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03and it just gets annoying to get it current
<Stormy> my phone is a boring Kin TwoM
<Lakorv> I downloaded 600 MB of updates for my desktop today.
<Stormy> I say "boring" because I can't use the wifi
<Lakorv> expanded, it made for 2.5 GB.
<drfsupercenter> 03for what, Windows?
<Lakorv> nope
*Stormy glares at the school network
<Lakorv> full system update for Arch Linux.
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Jason> xD
<drfsupercenter> 03never heard of that distro
<Sally> why not :o?
<Lakorv> too bad.
<Jason> Stormy: Buy a cheap router, and use it as a wireless bridge
<Stormy> it makes you register everything
<drfsupercenter> 03I usually just use Ubuntu if I need to use Linux for something
<drfsupercenter> 03like formatting hard drives
<drfsupercenter> 03because Windows sucks at that
<Jason> Oh D:
<Jason> So regi it
<Stormy> and it thinks my phone is an actual computer because the browser on it is Internet Explorer
<Hawkie> 07i have a question
<Jason> Ohh
<Jason> I got it
<drfsupercenter> 03?
<Hawkie> 07are you delicious?
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Jason> clone your comp mac address to your phone
<Stormy> And to register a computer you have to download the "security agent" and McAfee
<drfsupercenter> 03depends on if you like the food I just ate
*Hawkie flails - that question randomly came up in a game she played once.
<Stormy> :o how do you do that?
<Lakorv> random question.
<Jason> hmmm
<Hawkie> 07lol i know, right?
<Hawkie> 07i had fun asking people that

<Jason> like
<Hawkie> 07I don't talk to Helios anymore.
<drfsupercenter> 03I would if he were around

<Jason> ots called PDAnet
<Hawkie> 07m'kies.
<drfsupercenter> 03we saw Tron Legacy together back in December though

<Stormy> hmm
<Stormy> I don't think I can install apps to this phone
<Jason> Oh
<Jason> D:
<Jason> You download it through your comp
<Stormy> if it has to be on both the computer and the phone, it won't work
<Jason> d:
<Jason> D: *
<Jason> You could buy a cheap router
<Jason> like $20-30
<Stormy> I wish; the school doesn't allow them though
<Jason> No
<Jason> like
<Jason> plug it into your comp
<drfsupercenter> 03http://themetapicture.com/the-hardest-part-of-any-game/

<Stormy> You can't use a personal router

<drfsupercenter> 03it's like a 20KB program. Why does it take 5 minutes to install >_>
<Lakorv> it needs that time to litter your registry sufficiently.
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just drivers
<drfsupercenter> 03InfiniTV is a TV tuner by Ceton corp
<drfsupercenter> 03lets me record up to 4 TV shows at once, it's a pretty hardcore little device
<drfsupercenter> 03that cost me like $600 x.x

<drfsupercenter> 03Dialga, I play Portal on console.
<Dialga> >olivetext
<Dialga> and
<drfsupercenter> 03I have POrtal 2 for both PC and Xbox 360... only played the full game on Xbox
<Dialga> i'm still pointing it out
<drfsupercenter> 03played co-op on PC, but I want to play co-op with LL when she's done with it
<Dialga> as in why
<drfsupercenter> 03(yay achievement farming?)
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I just hate using the keyboard and mouse for games... when I DO use PC games, I use my wired Xbox 360 controller
<Dialga> i don't have portal 2 and i don't particularly plan on getting it because i already know the entire plot and stuff
<Dialga> i can't stand using controllers lopl
<Dialga> wasd + mouse
<Hawkie> 07^--
<Dialga> at least, i know everything there is to know about it because everyone's going batscheiße crazy about it
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate using WASD
<drfsupercenter> 03if I have to use the keyboard, I remap it to use the arrow keys
<drfsupercenter> 03also wtf Windows
<Dialga> >arrow keys
<Dialga> what
<drfsupercenter> 03it's saying the Ethernet controller is unrecognized hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03it came with the fricking motherboard, wtf
<Dialga> how do you jump
<drfsupercenter> 03shift?
<drfsupercenter> 03depends on the game, really.
<drfsupercenter> 03but I like using controllers
<drfsupercenter> 03or joysticks :D
<Dialga> that just seems incredibly inconvenient
<drfsupercenter> 03ever played Commander Keen (old DOS game)? That thing is instantly more epic using a joystick
<drfsupercenter> 032-button preferred
<drfsupercenter> 03or more
<Dialga> my friend has a flight stick thing with like 8 buttons
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I have this Microsoft Sidewinder joystick
<Dialga> i hate using it when i go to his house
<drfsupercenter> 03thing cost like $100 back in 2000 xD
<drfsupercenter> 03now you can get them for dirt cheap
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03gonna go downstairs so I can watch some TV or something, I'll be back on my laptop
<Dialga> i still prefer wasd + mouse lopl

<Damos> YAY A NEWBIE!
*Damos huggles the Newbie
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03I need to find a way to scan registry changes
<Manlyguy> Sorry for crushing your hopes. :/
<Armageddon> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Windows Defender?
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<drf|laptop> 03nah
<Armageddon> I already knew it was you
<drf|laptop> 03basically here's what I'm trying to do
<Manlyguy> Felt pretty good, actually.
<drf|laptop> 03in Windows media Center, you can do this little test to see if your computer is good enough to record in HD
<Armageddon> your hostname makes it obvious derp
<Manlyguy> I wonder why? xD
<Armageddon> and heya SLM
<drf|laptop> 03if it is, it asks you to click a button that makes a registry change allowing you to record HD
<drf|laptop> 03what I want to do is figure out what it does
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<HyperMetalLugia> aah, LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Not sure then XD
<HyperMetalLugia> But windows defender does detect those changes
<SLM> sup Armageddon
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<drf|laptop> 03there was this Nirsoft program but you have to know the specific task, and ehshell doesn't do it
<drf|laptop> 03I doubt it
<drf|laptop> 03since WMC is a windows program
<drf|laptop> 03it's n ot gonna do that
<HyperMetalLugia> I blocked EW apple from making a quicktime registry change to autostart XD
<HyperMetalLugia> But okay XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Have fun searching :o
<Ascendant> [10:55:47] <Magix> Armageddon: True you Dont has sausage?
<Ascendant> [10:55:47] <@helen> hi :)
<Ascendant> [10:55:50] <Magix> :P
<Ascendant> [10:55:59] <@helen> Magix: Armageddon = female
<Ascendant> ._.
<drf|laptop> 03autostarts are easy
<drf|laptop> 03just look in msconfig
<Armageddon> derp
<Manlyguy> I wish someone would die for once. It'd make things a lot more interesting around here.
<Armageddon> lmao
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Ascendant> lol msconfig
<Manlyguy> Not naming who. lol
<Ascendant> [10:50:57] <Damos> Your too good to get banned
<Ascendant> [10:51:04] <Damos> I never got banned here
<Ascendant> [10:51:08] <DreamMagma> of cour- i mean, no, why would you be banned?
<Ascendant> [10:51:28] <DreamMagma> i got banned for 20 mins once
<Ascendant> I don't mean channel ban lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Msconfig is Pro
<Ascendant> I meant server ban, more specifically, BOPM going ballistic at my IP and banning me for being on dronebl or something
