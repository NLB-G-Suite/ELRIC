<BlitzenAngel> Almost ded
<Shizuka> 13Mike: You can stop spamming now.
<Kneesocks> Me and scanty dont follow Rururu's either
<thelonepony> Squallken: ask away~
<Mike> Shizuka: Sorry, boredom is spreading
<flutterchu> allright
<Shizuka> 13then be bored somewhere else
<BlitzenAngel> That death scream
<Bronysith> oh hey its BlitzenAngel
<soulrider95> Shits on fire yo
<Mike> BlitzenAngel: Wilhelm Scream. That is all.
<BlitzenAngel> WAIT
<BlitzenAngel> WUT
<Bronysith> i shall take BlitzenAngel away
<Shizuka> 13suigintou what are you worried about, you've mastered levitation if your top half isn't connected to your bottom half
<BlitzenAngel> Dont do eeet
<Shizuka> 13you should be happy
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Mike> Bronysmith: Didn't I tie you to the wall?
<Shizuka> 13never mind
<Squallken> I was looking threw the list of movies Bronystate has but on, do movies labled with "C" C-movies, are they never allowed to be played again?
<RDash5000> DED
<Shizuka> 13Squallken: yes

<Yahooz> and Epic Movie

<DashWithRainbows> Yep, WMC movies are the best movies though.
<OperatorPony> I ahvent seen this in YEARS
<BlitzenAngel> GUYS, think of a christmassy name for your current name. If you arent christian, choose a name regarding your religion.
<Yahooz> No the best movies are borderline WMC, but can be joked about
<Yahooz> like MegaShark vs Giant Octopus
<DashWithRainbows> What if I have no religion, BlitzenAngel?
<AppleBloom> BlitzenAngel: Applebells?
<Shizuka> 13festivus poles for everyone!
<thelonepony> BlitzenAngel: lets not talk or get into religion, dont want to start a flamewar
<thelonepony> :S
<OperatorPony> Oh, when is the news letter coming out? I want to enter the survey to have my movie choosen
<Kencolt> Squallken: "C" movies survive-- but are rarekly requested. WMC covers movies that EVERYONE WHO WATCHED THE STREAM agreed tat they shuld never darken our monotors again.
<BlitzenAngel> DashWithRainbows: Then... uh... fish
<SkepticRider95> there

<otakon> now this must be redubbed with PONIES
<Squallken> not as bad when to compare it too "Star Wars Holiday Special"

<SkepticRider95> Shizuka: When ANYONE asks for brushie brushie, you say yes
<Bronysith> Squallken: die, for bringing that up
<Mike> If I ever have twins, I'm going to split them from birth, and I will always tell them that they have an evil twin, and that they will need to train so they may fight to the death. At their eighteenth birthday, I will give them a good luck and push both of them into the Chucky Cheese ball pit then lock it shut.

<twilight_sprinkle> so is there any point to this?
<twilight_sprinkle> hot pot
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lololol
<RoboGerbil> nope

<Mike> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: It has all.
<Shizuka> 13Enough.
<Shizuka> 13You start discussing porn I'll ban you faster than you can say "but wait".

<Bronysith> first time i heard about haruhi was about a Carameldansen video
<EggNog5000> I SHALL GATHER THE BUCKETS
<aniderp|bestcakeever> my feels wont happen
<twilight_sprinkle> that was kind of wimpy for an ending
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i may be gone for awhile :\
<Sumica> 00,10that's not carmadansen though Bronysith
<Kencolt> Mike: It's really simple. We're dealing with a wide range here. Including, at times, even kids. So, we have rules. You should READ THEM. Just a suggestion.
<Goldframe> actually heres the question...was that the last story for the first novel Shizuka?
*Bronysith steals Sumica s shins
<Shizuka> 13iunno
<Goldframe> i'd have check that
<Sumica> 00,10that came from a diffrent show

*Bronysith smashes Sumica s shins
<Shizuka> 13feels: the motion picture

<EggNog5000> my body is ready
<QuinnThePegaSistta> must hide!!
<Sumica> 00,10this dont look like Air
<Mike> Kencolt: I read them. I find my actions flow with the conversation.
<the_real_pony_1604> the most powerful of feels
<Bronysith> Ponyo time
<Goldframe> yay! Sumica agrees that Air gives the massive feels
<Sumica> 00,10the I was keeping up with traffic excuse wont work with cops either Mike
<QuinnThePegaSistta> i dont want the feels!! :'(
<Kencolt> Mike: Just trust the davice of your elders. And believe me-- I AM you elder. Heck. here, I'm pretty much everyone's elder.
<Goldframe> hell, any key visual novel turned anime, minus little buters, gives massive feels
<Shizuka> 13unless you use a bus sumica
<kidzrul732> fuck school!
<Goldframe> *little busters
<aniderp|bestcakeever> goodbye... maybe for awhile :\
<the_real_pony_1604> don't be sure of that kencolt, there are some elders in here
<Mike> Kencolt: I am aware of your age and being my 40 year superior.
<Kencolt> I'm 55.
<kidzrul732> ewwwwwww anime
<kidzrul732> I hate anime
<Shizuka> 13ew a teenager
<Buytoast> then leave
<Kencolt> the_real_pony_1604: I'm fairly secure in that.
<Kneesocks> ..
<kidzrul732> fine then cya for ever bronies

<the_real_pony_1604> okay, you win aganst my 32
<RoboGerbil> http://imgur.com/VXqIe,OD5Zs
<Mike> Sumica: Wasn't an excuse, but an explanation. I wasn't trying to get out of anything, I know i was guity of said charges, just explaining.
<Goldframe> remind me again how many series shown in the states are animated overseas
<twilight_sprinkle> Mike: ground youself to release said charges

<Mike> twilight_sprinkle: wat
<twilight_sprinkle> get it? ground? charges? eh....
<twilight_sprinkle> Mike: terrible physics humor
<Mike> twilight_sprinkle: ah i get it nao
*Bronysith takes twilight_sprinkle to bed for punishment
<Kencolt> Goldframe: THe majority, these days, are key-animated here, and filler-animated overseas. Others are imports entirely. MLP is, in fact, unusual in that it's entirely animated on the NA continent.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: but i dont wanna .-.
<Mike> twilight_sprinkle: I was assuming it wasn't a pun
<Kencolt> Goldframe: Then again, apparently, it's alsothe first time anyone used Flash to good effect.
<Goldframe> true
<Bronysith> needs more persona
<Mike> Kencolt: WHat about Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends? Didn't that use flash well?
<the_real_pony_1604> and it is a....... bad name
<Kencolt> Korea, in fact, has a HUGE in-betweener animation industry. Japan and the US use various studios that fill in the bits-- and very well, indeed.
<Kencolt> Mike: Yes-- but not to the almost insane intent that MLP has. You catually get, often a 3D effect in obviously 2D animation, almost unprecidented in Flash.
<otakon> well black wings
<AssaultWithEmbraces> i'm getting lag herre and there. What's happening to her wings?
<otakon> lovely
<otakon> AssaultWithEmbraces: she's "sin-bound"

*Bronysith s shadow enlarges over otakon
<otakon> no
<AssaultWithEmbraces> sin-bound?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> How/
<otakon> no idea
<Mike> Kencolt: Sweet.
<otakon> I read it from the wiki
*Bronysith shadow gets bigger over otakon
<otakon> I've missed most of it sadly

*Bronysith puts otakon in a blender
<otakon> I don't blend
<twilight_sprinkle> what is rakkas sin?
*Mike drags Bronysmith to the glue factory
<otakon> no idea
<otakon> so this is another purgatory anime?
<Shizuka> 13Mike: You're done. I'm not going to warn you again.
<EggNog5000> goodnight guys.
<otakon> Mike: dude you might want to stop
<otakon> night EggNog5000
<twilight_sprinkle> bye EggNog5000
<DerpyMuffins> Bye EggNog5000
<twilight_sprinkle> i must not know something about glue factories..
<Kneesocks> Night eggnog
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: glue is made from animal bones, usually horses or pigs
<Kencolt> See? Nopony listens to their elders.
<Mike> Shizuka: I'm sorry, then, for wanting bronysmith to stop with the endless /me
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: no offense, but age isnt everything you know
<Bronysith> otakon: is howls moving castle any good?
<Lyra`> yes
<otakon> Bronysith: Iliked it
<Lyra`> yes it is
<Bronysith> well it IS miyazaki >.>
<Mike> Bronysmith: Howls moing castle is awesome. Watch it.
<otakon> well that's creepy
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: It's all I GOT. I don't have my teeth, a proper nervous system, and one of my hips is fake. My eyes suck. Age is my main thing.
<Lyra`> what the hell?
<Lyra`> I DONT EVEN!?!?
<Bronysith> Mike: faggot
<otakon> Bronysith: stop that, he's right it is a good movie
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: That and s few experiences that aren't shared here-- but I'm willing to share.
<Lyra`> what happened to her?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: well, whats important is knowledge and morals, not age :P
<Mike> Bronysmith: Pls stahp
<Lyra`> did she take off her wings or something?
<Lyra`> i dont even know!
<otakon> Lyra`: she's sin-bound, basically means she's not been forgiven for her sins in her past life
<Lyra`> :o
<Bronysith> Mike: you keep purposely mispelling my name, you stop
<otakon> I have no idea how this show really works though
<Lyra`> oh, okay :3
<otakon> I've missed most of it
*Bronysith pushes EVA-02 ontop of Mike
<Lyra`> taylor smith
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: not saying you dont ave those, just saying its whats important
*Bronysith grabs twilight_sprinkle and takes off in megas
<Lyra`> if you reference anime, chances are, youre a twat muffin
<Lyra`> *popular
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: Stop spamming please.
<Mike> Wait... I didn't even notice that. Sorry.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: yes mam
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: And as for knowledge? Heh. I'm the guy who fills in the holes. A lot. But hey-- mainly I'm old (for here).
<Mike> Kencolt: Innuendos are fun.
<Kneesocks> Push meAnd then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction Push me And then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction Push me And then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Push me And then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Push me And then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Satisfaction
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: well again no offense,but remember to keep a bit of modesrt too
<Kneesocks> asdf
<Bronysith> holy fucking shit
<DerpyMuffins> Dat spam
<Shizuka> 13...
<twilight_sprinkle> *modesty
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: Not as old as Granny Smith. She's as old as dirt. I'm only as old as rocks-- I haven't been ground that fine yet.
<Bronysith> god
<Buytoast> what in the hell is going on here tonight
<DerpyMuffins> Why is chat always bad when Shizuka streams?
<Shizuka> 13ponies starting to work out what reki did
<Bronysith> whoever references bad music needs to die by the glorious satanic powers of ham
<Bronysith> Buytoast: run
<Tassadork> Buytoast: I know right...
<Mike> Kencolt: Rocks are younger than dirt because dirt is squished and melted to make rocks.
<Yahooz> I do admit though, Satisfaction is one of Ben Benassis more interesting works
<Buytoast> i mean i know it's still the weakend but i mean c'mon, it's the last vestiges of it
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oh no
<AssaultWithEmbraces> She's not going to
<Kencolt> Mike: Geologically unsound. "Squish" and "Melted" only leads to Composite and INcindiary rocks. Dirt comes from the slow erosion and crumbling of stone and rock. You argument is incorrect.
<Lyra`> darnit
<Lyra`> bitches need to stop breaking
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: nothings really going on
<Mike> Buytoast: I think Shizuka is less lenient to me than the other mods, thus protecting me from bringing lulz
<Tassadork> slime train?
<Lyra`> Shizuka doesnt tollerate my shit
<otakon> THE FUCK IS TAHT THIGN!?
<Lyra`> i love it :3
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NOOOO
<Mike> Kencolt: Your argument was flawed from the start.
<Bronysith> otakon: whats ur fav miyazaki film?
<Buytoast> well shit, she angered the Smokey Progg
<twilight_sprinkle> her wings are white again
<Buytoast> that's what you get
<Shizuka> 13DerpyMuffins: I'm starting to wonder myself. Makes me want to not stream.
<otakon> Bronysith: Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind
<Kencolt> Mike: It would bere, were it an argument. INstead, it's an established scientific definition. Look it up.
<Bronysith> otakon: dafuq
<otakon> Bronysith: dude it's like one of his best movies
<otakon> actually no my favorite is Spirited Away
<Bronysith> otakon: i gotcha, just the name, dafuq
<Bronysith> otakon: spirited away and princess mononoke are my favs
<Bronysith> god they are so fucked up
<Lyra`> Shizuka, have you seen madoaka magica?
<Bronysith> ennething by miyazaki is fucked up
<AssaultWithEmbraces> has she been forgiven?
<Lyra`> or otakon, really, whoever wants to respoond
<Lyra`> *respond
<Bronysith> and for some reason people love him for that
<Mike> Kencolt: Impossible. Your starting statement completely implies all dirt is older than rocks.
<Shizuka> 13AssaultWithEmbraces: as pointed out in the previous episode, you can't forgive yourself, someone with the reason to has to forgive you
<twilight_sprinkle> so where did she go?
<Shizuka> 13on
<twilight_sprinkle> heaven level 2?
<Kencolt> Mike: The opposite. I stated that I was younger than dirt, because I had not been ground down yet. Ever check you reading comprehension skills? Because, seriously-- you aren't reading what I'm writing.
<Tassadork> lol
<Shizuka> 13i think mike is just trying to start a fight
<Tassadork> best use of halo
<Lyra`> you saying mike is startin?
<twilight_sprinkle> oi gendo
<twilight_sprinkle> stop startin
<Mike> Kencolt: We're arguing exactly the same thing.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: your mums a slag
<Kencolt> Mike: IN other words, dirt is older than rocks-- yes. BECAUSE IT GOT GROUND DOWN. But they are technically the same age, at the core.
<Bronysith> HARUMPH
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: no, yer ma's the slag!
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: oi you startin something?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: oi start stoppin
<Bronysith> Dont be startin with me, im the fookin japanese military
<Mike> Kencolt: >Not as old as Granny Smith. She's as old as dirt. I'm only as old as rocks-- I haven't been ground that fine yet.
<twilight_sprinkle> so is this girl not forgiven yet?
<Kencolt> Precisely.
<Mike> Kencolt: We're arguing the same thing.
<Yahooz> Mike: the fact that you bring ponies into your arguement about rocks and dirt upsets me
<Shizuka> 13being forgiven removes the black mark of being sin-bound
<Shizuka> 13but you don't leave the town until you're ready
<twilight_sprinkle> ah ok
<Lyra`> that makes more sense
<Bronysith> Shizuka: god why is this so feels?
<Tassadork> so, I guess they hang around and talk to each other, until someone finds a reason to forgive the other?
<klobb> that was touching. THanks for playing it.
<Kencolt> Yahooz: I bought that up before-- not not in terms of his flawed geology. He still seems to have a funny idea about how dirt is made.
<vinyl-scartch> hi
<Lyra`> i have a feeling that my wings would be like a negative of dalmation print
<vinyl-scartch> lol
<Shizuka> 13in case you missed the earlier eps, it's strongly implied that the dream a haibane has in the cocoon is their last moments somewhere else
<twilight_sprinkle> pretty much Tassadork lol
<Shizuka> 13so given that, three guesses how reki ended up here
<Shizuka> 13and the first two don't count
<twilight_sprinkle> jumped from a plane?
<Bronysith> it's called skydiving
<QuinnThePegaSistta> whos streeming next??
<Bronysith> oh no, Shizuka is leaving us
<the_real_pony_1604> well, there is alot to be said about Rakka also
<Lyra`> its called tactical insertion
<twilight_sprinkle> if reki is the main girl that is
<Mike> Kencolt: Dirt is ground up rock, at the simplest explanation. Rock in itself, is dirt, compacted or solidified from a solution.
<Bronysith> Lyra`: ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
<klobb> Thank you for the stream Shizuka.
<otakon> welp thanks for the stream Shizuka
<otakon> Mike: so...dirt is dirt huh?
<Lyra`> nope
<vinyl-scartch> hi
<Sumica> 00,10nice stream Shizuka
<otakon> hello vinyl-scartch
<DerpyMuffins> Thanks Shizuka
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Thankies for the stream, Shizuka
<Lyra`> thankies Shizuka
<the_real_pony_1604> no, dirt is ground up rock if organic material in it
<Mike> hi vinyl-scartch
<otakon> also I'm gonna vote "Meet the Feebles" for B
<Bronysith> oi Sumica are you the fookin japanese military?
<vinyl-scartch> what sre we watching
<Bronysith> otakon: die
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Thanks for the stream shizu
<otakon> Bronysith: nto yet :3
<twilight_sprinkle> dont see how else she couldve ended up falling from that height other than a plane
<DerpyMuffins> Sorry if chat wasn't with par with your expectations Shizuka
<Kencolt> Shizuka: Face it. It's another one of those nice, moving, and often WTF animes you are so enamoured of... for which I am usually thankful. Good stream, but I must admit, I never got into Haibane.
<the_real_pony_1604> cliff
<Bronysith> otakon: i know, i swtill have use of you
<Sumica> 00,10Stop start'en Bronysith
<Shizuka> 13i have pretty low expectations of mane chat but it always manages to sneak under it
<Shizuka> 13Kencolt: innit though :)
<Bronysith> Sumica: still gettin that for ya man, from the bastard himself
<Tassadork> vinyl-scartch: we are watching shizuka's outro video thing
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, thanks for streaming.
<otakon> Shizuka: hey how about something out there next time... maybe like PS&G?
<twilight_sprinkle> but yeah thanks for stream Shizuka
<otakon> ^
<Shizuka> 13the moving ones are what i keep in my library, the more mainstream ones like bebop and death note i get through like once and never go back
<Goldframe> I may have to actually watch Haibane from the start
<Bronysith> otakon: whats with you and gainax?
<Shizuka> 13stand alone complex being the exception because tech
<Buytoast> you still have expectations for this chat?
<twilight_sprinkle> we need to fully watch code geass, we always stop at 8 eps or so
<twilight_sprinkle> it has a lot of feels too
<otakon> Bronysith: what? I like PS&G
<Bronysith> otakon: gainax is the DAFUQ of anime
<Goldframe> GitS: SAC was a good series
<Yahooz> Buytoast: at least for some people
<weeping_pegasi82> excuse me while I die from happiness
<otakon> Bronysith: not all the time
<Kandarihu> You know what? I think the reason the chat dies down during subbed anime is because people are busy trying to follow the subs.
<Kencolt> Shizuka: And yet, you have yet to show Lain.
<otakon> and then THE PADDLIN'
<Bronysith> otakon: most of their shit is DAFUQ
<Shizuka> 13true that... i grabbed lain once but was too wtf'd out in the first episode
<otakon> Bronysith: Evangelion was the only real one
<Lyra`> and then that SuperBrony64 stream :3
<Goldframe> Lain = WTF
<Shizuka> 13might have to reacquire some time
<Mike> Kandarihu: Assuming we are watching and paying attention.
<weeping_pegasi82> MY FANFICTION IS ACTUALLY GETTING ATTENTION!!
<otakon> weeping_pegasi82: yay for you
<Bronysith> otakon: anytime you watch something of gainax you will say dafuq in 1(confusion, 2(utter awesomeness 3(what the hell is going on
<weeping_pegasi82> yes yes yes yes yes
<twilight_sprinkle> meh, eva is the best thing that company made
<Yahooz> weeping_pegasi82: want a cookie?
<otakon> Bronysith: FLCL evokes all three
<weeping_pegasi82> yes yes yes... yes
<Goldframe> psh
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: LIES
<Goldframe> GunBuster
<weeping_pegasi82> sorry just excited
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: Gurren Lagann
<Kencolt> Shizuka: The thing about Lain is... well... it actually starts to make total coherent sense. IF you can see it.
<otakon> Goldframe: Gunbuster is good too
<the_real_pony_1604> you should show dokoru for the lulz one night
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i didnt like gurren lagann, or die buster or gun buster
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: O_O
*Goldframe shuns twilight_sprinkle
<Lyra`> Shizuka, when do you find time to sleep?
<otakon> HOW CAN YOU DENY HOT BLOODED NESS!?
<Shizuka> 13yeah so i read, have a bunch to do this week though so probably won't stream again til after christmas maybe
<twilight_sprinkle> but eva was pretty good
<Bronysith> otakon: i cant watch FLCL
<Yahooz> What if... we DIDNT STREAM ANIME o_0
<otakon> Bronysith: why not? it's awesome
<Bronysith> Shizuka: merry christmas to you
<otakon> Yahooz: that would be bad
<Mike> Yahooz: The horror
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: because i dont like purely hot bloodedness
<Bronysith> otakon: cause i ate my own hand
<Shizuka> 13still need to get ffsplit to work with ustream, need moar gaming with this embed
<Yahooz> lol u srs?
<otakon> Bronysith: .... dammit
<Goldframe> Abenobashi is more WTF than FLCL
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: if it had more to offer then i would like it, but it doesnt
<Bronysith> otakon: i ate my own hand and then it grew out of my head, i couldnt watch it anymore
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: okay for ONE Gunbuster is NOT pure hotbloodness so your argument in invalid
<the_real_pony_1604> yeah, and abenobashi has full frontal underage nudity
<otakon> Bronysith: you need help, I'm putting you back in regulars for therapy
<Goldframe> at least with FLCL you can keep track of what's going on
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, next time I see you streaming Left 4 Dead, I'm going to send you a friend invite.
<Bronysith> otakon: you put me in there and ill kill you in your sleep with a wrench
<otakon> the_real_pony_1604: really? I have it, I never noticed under age frontal nudity
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: well all of those shows have attempts at a providing more, but i didnt like them
<Mike> Yahooz: For one, I only pay attention to dubs because I find it hard to read and pay attention to the anime, and two, because I prefer 90's cartoons.
<the_real_pony_1604> the boy, full frontal at one point
<otakon> Mike: bah scrub, i can pay attention to chat and dubs
<Kencolt> Goldframe: Even if you have no idea WHAT is going on, in FLCL you can keep track. You're just never certain of what you're keeping track OF>
<otakon> the_real_pony_1604: you'd think I would remember that
<otakon> but I like Abenobashi
<otakon> hell I think I'll pick it up on BLuray if they have it
<Yahooz> Mike: you need more varying exposure to bronystate streams
<Bronysith> Gurren lagann is probably my fav work of gainax
<the_real_pony_1604> it is just a flash of it right around the bathhouse episode
<Mike> otakon: Get on my level, pleeb
<Bronysith> Gurren lagann is my fav anime, with NGE in a close second...i have no idea why NGE is in my top three though
<otakon> Mike: what is that supposed to mean?
<otakon> Mike: you said you can't keep up with subs and chat at the same time, I said I can.
<Bronysith> otakon: i dont get it, i dont understand why NGE is in my top three fav animes
<twilight_sprinkle> eva has glorious mindbuckery which is why i enjoy it
<the_real_pony_1604> after the bathhouse explodes or whatever. it is just a floor and some busted walls
<otakon> Bronysith: no idea
<Mike> Yahooz: I've been on Wrek, Dari(I think), Shizuka, and a few others.
<Kencolt> Mike: The first rule of Bronystate is you are at the mercy of the Mods, except on late Fridays and Saturday afternoons. Any other time-- there is NO TELLING WHAT SHOWS.
<Yahooz> daris streams <3333
<otakon> anyway brb, need to hit the john
<the_real_pony_1604> have not seen it for years but I remember finding it odd back in the day
<Shizuka> 13well we really only have six streamers
<Bronysith> otakon: cause it is indeed a good anime, but not the best, maybe cause it is really fuckgin serious
<Shizuka> 13used to have more
<Bronysith> speaking of Evangelion
<texasboykc09> Shizuka: who are the streamers?
<Tassadork> what does it take to become a streamer?
<Bronysith> when the hell is 3.33 out?
<Bronysith> i need my depression
<twilight_sprinkle> DCD didnt restream JOJO on thursday ;_;
<Yahooz> Mike: Try making it for a Vivi stream if she ever comes back
<Mike> Otakon: I was referring to the ridiculousness of the word scrub
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: it's already out in japan
<weeping_pegasi82> 13 favorites in 2 days!! *squee!*
<Goldframe> in the states? 2-3 years
<Shizuka> 13will hit australia first in 2013 then finally get over here
<weeping_pegasi82> hey I used to live in australia!
<Bronysith> Shizuka: yay, i cant wait to see it
<RoboGerbil> Shizuka: i would stream if someone let me :)
<Shizuka> 13imdb has an unconfirmed release range of january 2013 for the states, but will probably much later be
<Bronysith> goddamnit
<Bronysith> ah well
<twilight_sprinkle> ooh, january would be nice
<Bronysith> at least ill have guild wars 2 and PSO2 to satiate my wait for 3.33
<Phase4> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/img/as_spy.png
<Shizuka> 13rebuild 2 dvd took like a year to make it over here
<the_real_pony_1604> I am setup for streaming but no one wants to watch me play minecraft. HAHAH
<Sumica> 00,10pssssssss, Shizuka
<twilight_sprinkle> im listening to eva 3.33 ost right now :3
<Mike> Kencolt: Also, wat, by varying streams I thought he meant different streamers. that was irrelevant.
<Phase4> Shizuka, why does australia get stuff like that first
<Phase4> its wierd
<RoboGerbil> we already watch someone play minecraft twice a week
<Shizuka> 13oh also sumica, new camrip on that site i linked you before
<Sumica> 00,10dibs~
<Shizuka> 13:P
<NocturnalBlade> Good morning everypony :)
<Sumica> 00,10lost said link
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi NocturnalBlade
<Bronysith> its hilarious how the nostalgia critic got blown to hell by the guy who voiced shinji
<texasboykc09> hello NocturnalBlade

<Lyra`> otakon, do you drive a subaru?
<NocturnalBlade> Mike: 12 o clock here lol
<otakon> TO EQD
<otakon> Lyra`: no why?
<NocturnalBlade> bye ken
<Lyra`> otakon, do you listen to tegan and sara?
<twilight_sprinkle> we need to watch eva on christmas, for that jolly holiday spirit~
<Mike> cya ken, hope for more comflicts.
<Lyra`> otakon, do you drink out of a nalgene bottle?
*NocturnalBlade hugs Mike twilight_sprinkle and texasboykc09
<Bronysith> goddamnit why do i like Evangelion, i seriously dont understand why it is so popular
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: because mindbuckery
<Lyra`> if you answered yes, to two or more of those questions, you might be a lesbian.
<otakon> Lyra`: ... where have I heard these before?
<Lyra`> science doesnt lie.
<Bronysith> most likely cause it has hot girls in skin tight clothing and "mechs"
<otakon> Lyra`: ...Spinnerette?
<Lyra`> yup :D
<otakon> lol you read it too?
<Lyra`> my favorite page of that comic <3
<Sumica> 00,10unit 02-dash.......I see that geting used
<Lyra`> you know i do!
<otakon> lol
<Mike> NocturnalBlade: I seem to be hated today because Shizuka is less lenient. Thank you for that.
<otakon> I like it
<Lyra`> best lesbian super hero EVER!
<Shizuka> 13Mike: Or it could be because you're trying to provoke everyone
<otakon> one of the few apparently
<NocturnalBlade> Mike: what you mean?
<Lyra`> and shes not a lesbian super hero. shes just a super hero. who happens to like girls.
<Mike> Shizuka: I'm pointing out flaws. It's their decision whether to reply.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Mike, don't point out flaws. It doesn't come out pretty.
<texasboykc09> ^
<texasboykc09> i learned that the hard way
<Mike> NocturnalBlade: Bronysith was spamming and I tried to mess with him, which Shizuka didn't approve of.
<twilight_sprinkle> meh
<Lyra`> mike, just add an extra I to your name
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ESPECIALLY if the flaws are about a person. Then you just asked for trouble.
<Lyra`> and the word snow
<Lyra`> become, Miike Snow
<twilight_sprinkle> i cant agree with that AssaultWithEmbraces
<Bronysith> Mike: you revealed PM logs
<twilight_sprinkle> while in this case it felt like Mike did go overboard
<otakon> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> and it felt more like trolling tbh
<otakon> yeah dude that's messed up
<twilight_sprinkle> and revealing pm logs in mane chat is something im personally against too
<Yahooz> Mike: disclosing pms are against network ToS, you /could/ be k-lined
<Lyra`> PM logs are sacred
<otakon> hell even LYRA knows that
<Mike> Bronysith: Ah. My memory of rules tends to be hazy, you know.
<otakon> Mike: no excuses, you should be lucky you weren't banned
<Bronysith> Mike: ignorance is no excuse for lawbreaking
<Lyra`> mostly because if my PM logs got out, i might go to jail >.> <.<
<Bronysith> Lyra`: same
<otakon> Lyra`: .... you scare me sometimes filly
<Lyra`> hey, its legal in australia
<twilight_sprinkle> but still AssaultWithEmbraces ,i cant agree with not revealing flwas. people should accept that they have flaws and try to improve it. like my parents told me, people who truly care about you will tell you about your flaws, others will just play along
<Lyra`> damn american citizenship
<NocturnalBlade> Lyra`is crazy but likeable ^_^
<Bronysith> otakon: sometimes?
<Lyra`> thanks NocturnalBlade :D
<Mike> Otakon: Again, I'm not pleading not guilty with this.
<Bronysith> otakon: shes like the female version of me
<AssaultWithEmbraces> twilight_sprinkle: I know. But revealing a person's flaws for the purpose of making fun of them is what I was getting at.
<otakon> ...
<Lyra`> oh hell no, Bronysith
<otakon> no Bronysith she is WAY beyond your level of odd
<Bronysith> :D
<Jmo> How's that slurping Blade.
<Bronysith> otakon: hence why i love her
<otakon> well good for you
<Lyra`> im like a more amazing female version of saturn
<NocturnalBlade> Jmo: do what now?
<Bronysith> except Saturn is gentle
<Lyra`> with a bit of saxton hale thrown in.
<Mike> Lyra`: So you're a tiny head with a big nose?
<twilight_sprinkle> NocturnalBlade: i think hes saying youre sucking up
<Jmo> Ding ding ding ding.
<Jmo> We have a winner.
<Lyra`> mike, dont cross me.
<twilight_sprinkle> but i dont see whats the point of sucking up to an ordinary user
<twilight_sprinkle> so i dont think he is
<Mike> Lyra`: Sorry, couldn't resist.
<Lyra`> :3
<Bronysith> otakon: i think we need to take cover
<twilight_sprinkle> unless im unaware of something
<otakon> no
<NocturnalBlade> twilight_sprinkle: ah
<otakon> no we don't
<Lyra`> or, i suppose, im Saturns evil twin
<Bronysith> Lyra`: well ya, Saturn s gentle
<Lyra`> or evil older sister?
<otakon> Lyra`: I hate to say it but I think you and Saturn would get along famously
<otakon> and that scares me
<Lyra`> we do
<otakon> hell speaking of him, anyone hear from the silly Scot today?

<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: shut up and enjoy one of the most overrated animes ever
<CriticKitten> Nasty cough. Won't go away. 'tis part of being a sickly lil' thing.
<Shizuka> 13doitdoitdoitdoit
<Bronysith> Shizuka: i knew you would say that
<Shizuka> 13just not the camrip, still pretty bleh quality and looks like it's on its side
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: but spoilers will make that harder
<Bronysith> word for word
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> but eh i dont really care for spoilers that much, so i guess whatevs
<Lyra`> i read that as *catnip, Shizuka
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: ...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcrga9bBj7o&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=142
<Yahooz> this entire chat is just like
<Yahooz> beep boop
<Yahooz> imma cloud
<twilight_sprinkle> entire chat is ded
<twilight_sprinkle> all the juice is gone
<Bronysith> everything is made of rubber
<Bronysith> and before you even ask
<Bronysith> yes
<NocturnalBlade> not the juice
<Bronysith> yes it is
<Yahooz> The juice was gone before you frikkin began drinking
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> LEEEEEEEEEEEEEROYYYYYY!
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: how goes paying 15 dollars a month?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Good
<CriticKitten> Mmm, much better. Cough medicine tastes nasty, but it at least helps with that dry throat feeling. ^^
<Bronysith> guild wars 2 has the potential to destroy wow
<Buytoast> AHAHAHA
<CriticKitten> No it doesn't
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh everyone fucking says that about EVERY new MMO
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> It gets fucking old
<texasboykc09> MMO?
<Bronysith> i know XD
<Bronysith> Massive multiplayer online
<Buytoast> I don't even care too much about WoW anymore but even I know nothing can kill WoW.
<Buytoast> Besides, it's doing that fine on its own.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> They said that about The Old Republic didnt they?
<KrazyNoobs> <3
<Bronysith> what?
<CriticKitten> GW2's player count is already dropping, and they didn't even break three mil. But it's doing well enough and I'm happy with it. :p
<Bronysith> TOR killing wow? even then i knew was bullshit
<Bronysith> Blizzard is almost as evil as EA
<KrazyNoobs> <3 <3 <3
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Except Blizzard actually semi cares for its players
<Buytoast> Activision-Blizzard you mean
<KrazyNoobs> gawd, that was funny when that happened
<CriticKitten> TOR was never gonna kill WoW either, because it IS WoW
<Yahooz> KrazyNoobs: dont go breakin my heart now
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLeqLaIFNx0&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=149 Go go His World
<Buytoast> Well yeah, the Old republic basically copy and pasted wow's abilities into its game.
<CriticKitten> Even the interface is identical, seriously, they made NO efforts to conceal it.
<KrazyNoobs> yay
<KrazyNoobs> a video
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> CriticKitten: That bad huh?
<NocturnalBlade> dat sumi?
<NocturnalBlade> eeyup
<twilight_sprinkle> hmm....should i or should i not...
<Bronysith> Shizuka: get your plot in here
<CriticKitten> Spade: It's got a "retro" mode for the interface that is identical to WoW's.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I dont want to sound blind but I have not seen one MMO that felt like it could tear me away from WoW
<otakon> ....
<otakon> the hell is this?
<CriticKitten> That's about as blatant as it gets
<Bronysith> otakon: sneak peak of 3.33

<Sumica> 00,10the best kind of teaser
<otakon> DAMMIT
<Kandarihu> Except that Asuka is alive.
*SpadeKyurem[WoW] flips table
<Goldframe> shizu, just pray that they don't screw it like like they did with End of Eva
<Shizuka> 13TheGreatAndPowerfulT: 13 minute camrip is out from somewhere in the middle of the movie, 30 minute camrip is out near the end, both are pretty awful quality
<Bronysith> otakon: need i repeat myself a 3rd time?
<otakon> Sumica: show Dead Leaves please, I need random to clear my head

<Bronysith> otakon: probably one of the best anime companies out there...god why do they piss us off
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, asking to pm someone kinda riuins the whole private thing
<texasboykc09> hello Sumica
<Goldframe> screw dead leaves, redline
<CriticKitten> Heading to bed. Cough's still there but not as bad, hoping will be gone by tomorrow.

<Bronysith> otakon: i love gainax for gurren lagann
<Bronysith> love/hate them for evangelion

<Bronysith> otakon: mechs require space travel at some point
<Bronysith> cause
<Bronysith> Gurren lagann is awesome
<Bronysith> wait thats not wat i wanted to say
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I love how Sumica nonshelantly rammed that officer
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WELP
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: Clearly <_<

<Bronysith> FLCL is just...what
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> FLCL?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What?
<Bronysith> Fooly Cooly
<fluttercry> 05,15Woohoo! All my IRC ping sounds have been changed to Persona 4 related clips. Tonight is a complete success
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> fluttercry: orly
<gunthler> O_O
*Jmo slaps fluttercry around a bit with a large trout
<Bronysith> fluttercry: i might be getting a vita for chrismtas, so then ill be able to play persona 4 gold
<fluttercry> 05,15Now when people say my name, it goes "ACE DETECTIVE"
<Bronysith> fluttercry: but as of now, persona 3 is better
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Why buy a Vita?
<fluttercry> 05,15lies
<texasboykc09> what do all think with my first oc with the worlds longest mane http://i.imgur.com/te4us.png
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: so i can play alot of my playstation network games on the go
<Kandarihu> I swear, if I ever get this game, I'm modding out the WEAZEL NEWS.
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: hit complete scan first
<Shizuka> 13if you have mp3s or shortcuts to mp3s in there
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: but again, might be a GIFT to me so i wont complain if i get it
<Shizuka> 13ah there you go <3
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Can you mod a nuke into this game?
<Afflict> hey KindOne
<Kandarihu> Does it also take flacs?
<Shizuka> 13yeah that's how i loaded mine in, better than rollercoaster tycoon 3 where you have to put the files in there
<Shizuka> 13it might take flac, details are in the readme i think
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: ikr, i was like "whoa awesome" when SA could do shortcuts too
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Ohai fluttercry *hugs*
<Bronysith> fluttercry: but why do you hate persona 3?
<Shizuka> 13oo is this a main quest mission or a side? haven't seen this before
<Kandarihu> I have a Steam folder on my external HDD now. So I'll be installing this game on the same drive as all of my music, then.
<fluttercry> 05,15I don't hate Persona 3. It was a lot of fun. But 4 was better
<Bronysith> fluttercry: so why do you hate persona 3?
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, a "recent Places" icon has shown up on my desktop and I can't delete it.
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: did you do the playboy/that other guy mission yet? that's the last one i did
<Shizuka> 13the holland play or something
<Bronysith> fluttercry: is it because you got your ass kicked in persona 3?
<Shizuka> 13oki :P
<Shizuka> 13well fun <3
<NocturnalBlade> whoa
<Bronysith> fluttercry: i know i am currently getting my ass kicked in persona 3
<fluttercry> 05,15Bronysith what part of "I don't hate Persona 3, I thought it was fun" do you not get?
<Bronysith> fluttercry: cause you fucking pulled a Kenye west XD
<Bronysith> "yo persona 3 im happy for you and imma let you finish, but PErsona 4 is much better"
<fluttercry> 05,15tis the truth
<Bronysith> fluttercry: dont spoil persona 3 for me
<Bronysith> or i will do to you what 4kids did to one piece
<thelonepony> I'm back~
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: jesus christ how horrifying
<texasboykc09> wb thelonepony
<Bronysith> Shizuka knows whats up
<fluttercry> 05,15also, Dwayne is way better than Playboy X in GTAIV
<thelonepony> oHai texasboykc09 :)
<Sylandest> /msg MemoServ READ NEW
<Sylandest> damn
<Shizuka> 13yeah i kept dwayne alive, gta wiki says he gives you better options going forward
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bronysith: So..butcher it mercesiclly?
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, your chat is writing checks your body can't cash... but I still agree with your sentiment.
<Vordox> Bronysith: Yohoho, he took a bite outta of Gum Gum.
<gunthler> fluttercry: dwayne givs back up :3
<Shizuka> 13:P
<fluttercry> 05,15That he does. PlayboyX only gives you some money and I think maybe a jacket
<texasboykc09> Sumica: do you know how long it took them to make this game?
<Shizuka> 13midlife crisis is the only SA track i have loaded in
<Kandarihu> Sumica, are the Nanoha ED themes in the mix?
<Shizuka> 13radio x was the best
<Shizuka> 13say it with me, saaaaaaaage
<fluttercry> 05,15I hear GNR radio
<fluttercry> 05,15or is in JNR
<fluttercry> 05,15I can't remember
<thelonepony> Vordox: who took a bite outta of gum gum?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fluttercry did you get rid of the "recent places" thing already ?
<Bronysith> Vordox: where are they?
<Shizuka> 13the camera looks drunk
<Shizuka> 13wobbling a bit
<fluttercry> 05,15TheGreatAndPowerfulT yup
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Camera go home
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> k
<Kandarihu> Nothing goes with vehicular carnage quite like "Make a Little Wish" and "Spritual Garden"
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You're drunk
<Shizuka> 13OH i know why
<Vordox> ....
<Bronysith> fluttercry: so yea, spoil it for me and you know what happens
<Vordox> you guys... =P
<Shizuka> 13it's to make sure the image isn't static, to prevent burn in
<fluttercry> 05,15"What do you call 4 geniuses soloing at once?
<Shizuka> 13but the HUD would do that so...
<fluttercry> 05,15"Jazz"
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Shizuka: Burn in?
<Kandarihu> thelonepony, it's a line from the terribad opening to the One Piece dub.
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: 4kids dub, the funimation one isnt bad
<thelonepony> ^
<Shizuka> 13SpadeKyurem[WoW]: CRT tv/monitors and i think some plasmas have this issue where if you leave one image on the screen too long the pixels get stuck
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, so I hear.
<fluttercry> 05,15I liked the conservative talk radio show in GTA4. It made me laugh
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: no seriously, the funimation one is really enjoyable with great voice actors
<thelonepony> How they ask a kid to end world hunger one? i love that bit
<Shizuka> 13WCTR was better, I Say You Say was more fun than the hyperstereotypes they're using in PLR and WKTT
<fluttercry> 05,15I liked the hypersterotypes though. There was no moderation. Either everyone was a hippie, or a gun nut
<fluttercry> 05,15"Science is a four letter word in my home. The only time science is okay is when it's about turning a million ungrateful foreigners into glass"
<Bronysith> i liked running over old people in gta4
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bronysith: Good on ya, getting rid of the old farts
<Shizuka> 13the little genius kid getting spanked on PLR is kind of funny but usually i have it on the user track station
<Shizuka> 131992 music was so much better :P
<fluttercry> 05,15Xbox doesn't have the user station.
<Shizuka> 13:<
<fluttercry> 05,15So I usually flipped between Lazlo, WKTT, and Liberty Rock
<Bronysith> i didnt care for san andreas
<Shizuka> 13laszlo's station is really eh... i liked him more when he was stuck in the middle of chris fromage and darius fontaine
<Shizuka> 13and ogg lock
<fluttercry> 05,15It certainly wasn't as good as the old Laszlo, but it was better than some of the other stuff.
<Bronysith> i hope GTA5 is going to be on PC
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, I'm super excited for GTA5. It seems that their going for the "Buddy crime action/comedy" feel
<Bronysith> fluttercry: but GTA4 was good
<wipergone2> hi everypony
<Kimori> anyone still awake
<Shizuka> 13fluttercry: we're just getting old, music these days is just noise amirite
<Buytoast> damn, the only grand theft auto game i remember actually playing was vice city
<fluttercry> 05,15GTA4 was awesome.
<Buytoast> and for some reason it was always that fat guy and the chainsaw mission
<Shizuka> 13i still need to play VC
<twilight_sprinkle> they remade gta vice city for iStuff btw
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka WHAT WAS THAT SPEAK UP! I don't hear so well
<Shizuka> 13huh wha
<twilight_sprinkle> or rather ported, not remade
<wipergone2> Shizuka: hi
<Bronysith> fluttercry: dont make me blend you
*Shizuka 13sticks a giant funnel in her ear
<fluttercry> 05,15Fun fact: I'm actually hard of hearing in my right ear due to a bad infection when I was a baby
<Afflict> yeah
<texasboykc09> fluttercry: how bad was it?
<Bronysith> fluttercry: im hard of hearing cause of a vanhalen concert
<Bronysith> sitting us right next to the speakers and forgetting my ear plugs
<Bronysith> totally worth it
<fluttercry> 05,15texasboykc09 bad enough that I have to constantly ask people to repeat things
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, no game will ever have a better soundtrack than Fallout 3
<Bronysith> Shadow of the colossus
<Bronysith> ARGUMENT INVALID BITCH
<Shizuka> 13a wild sumica appeared
<texasboykc09> fluttercry: that get annoying after a while
<Buytoast> man shadow of the colossus
<wipergone2> what game should i get on steam
<fluttercry> 05,15Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots, you're argument is invalid
<Buytoast> i remember my cousins had that game
<Vordox> <---- Computer in your computer
<Vordox> :D
<Buytoast> they hated it because they couldm't figure it out
<Shizuka> 13wow they already had niko's resume on file

<Shizuka> 13true
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> But Sumica doesnt cheat
<Shizuka> 13i've used the health/weapon cheat more times than i care to count
<NocturnalBlade> daaaamn
<fluttercry> 05,15I usually don't cheat until after I've beat the game
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Is Shizu accompanying Sumica in the destruction of Liberty City tonight?
<Barbetos> I never cheat on my girlfriends.
<otakon> I THINK I CAN!
<NocturnalBlade> nnope

<NocturnalBlade> AssaultWithEmbraces: the song artist lol
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: no cloverleafs? phoenix was like that
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Riot mode?
<fluttercry> 05,15SpadeKyurem[WoW] everyone started killing each other
<Shizuka> 13SA's story had los santos start rioting at one point
<Bronysith> Shizuka: phoenix wright?
<Barbetos> San Andreas also has JET PACKS Sumi
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> fluttercry: sounds like the best thing ever
<Shizuka> 13referencing the 1992 LA riots over a similar cop corruption case
<Barbetos> That game was AMAZING in other words
<Shizuka> 13there was a cheat to force the riots on any time
<Barbetos> Aw yeaah
<fluttercry> 05,15GTA3 had that mode too
<Barbetos> What?
<Barbetos> I dun remember that
<fluttercry> 05,15People would walk around with M60s and shoot everyone
<Barbetos> Waaat?
<Barbetos> I never seen that
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: So you got a suit and a new car what are you gonna do now?!
<fluttercry> 05,15State of Emergency
<texasboykc09> how long is it takeing fo it to download?
<texasboykc09> *for
<Bronysith> i want the vita so i can play persona 4
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Who stole our car?
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: is it actively going? steam tends to stop downloads when you start a game up
<Afflict> ok, you?
<Shizuka> 13right :P
<Kimori> doing ok thanks
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Where the fuck did our Pimping car go?
<fluttercry> 05,15HE STOLE A CAR! SHOOT HIM
<Shizuka> 13dat Air
<Shizuka> 13tori no uta remix?
<Bronysith> god i love shadow of the colossus
<Barbetos> Maybe this is just me, but Skype makes my games run like poo
<Bronysith> such a perfect game
<Goldframe> oooh, it is
<Shizuka> 13guess i should get air huh :P
<Afflict> it was pretty active today
<Barbetos> 10? for jo right?
<Zeus> hello everypony
<NocturnalBlade> ohai Zeus
<Barbetos> Hi
<Bronysith> you're not Zeus
<Shizuka> 13this is nice mix
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, do the shortcuts have to be for individual files? Or would a playlist suffice?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: Swingset shenanigans?
<otakon> uh huh
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: has to be the individual files
<Barbetos> Bronysith sh. Don't ruin it for him (he paid me good money to act like he is)
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, okay. I guess it'll work out.
<Shizuka> 13and then you could still copy the actual files in if the shortcuts don't work
<fluttercry> 05,15I think sunglasses are only in the Russian store
<fluttercry> 05,15same with hats
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Why only the Russian store?
<Barbetos> Ima listen to babs seed while you play.
<Shizuka> 13i've had a couple tracks just not play when the radio gets to them, i think it's because they're too long or maybe the filename/tags have something it doesn't like
<Afflict> we just need something to talk about haha
<Barbetos> Its.. Kind of funny actually.
<Kimori> lol
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Barbetos: I'm blasting City escape watching this
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> It fits amusingly
<Shizuka> 13dat nope
<Kimori> sorry, I havent been in the best of moods lately :(
<Barbetos> Sorry for text wall. Pedestrians riot
<Barbetos> While playing the game, press Down, Up, Left, Up, X, R1, R2, L2, L1. If you entered the code correctly, a message will appear. Note: Saving the game will make the effects of this code permanent.
<Barbetos> Huh
<fluttercry> 05,15SpadeKyurem[WoW] LIVE AND LEARN
<Barbetos> GTA 3
<Zeus> this in game radio is sadly better than the crap i hear on the way to class
<Afflict> it's ok, hope you feel better soon :)
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Live and Learn is great but I dont think it goes with everything
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> It isnt Guile's theme
<Goldframe> Zeus: he's running the custom playlist atm
<Shizuka> 13GTA4 really needed an interstate like SA
<Barbetos> yes
<Shizuka> 13somewhere you could just open up the throttle and go all the way around the world
<Goldframe> oooh, this the original version I hear?
<Zeus> Goldframe: ...still better
<Goldframe> or is it from the movie?
<Shizuka> 13speaking of more anime to show maybe i'll show akira soon since no one votes for it
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> PHYSICS
<Shizuka> 13oh sumica collision detection is HARD :P
<fluttercry> 05,15TETSUOOOOOOOOOOO
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> PHYSICS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY
<texasboykc09> http://i.imgur.com/QphxY.png what do all think of my second oc?
<NocturnalBlade> Dethklok woooo <3
<Shizuka> 13even though every game engine implements rain as a cylinder around the camera which should easily be able to hull check for a skybox above it
<Kandarihu> Oh, COFFEE!
<fluttercry> 05,15Akira was actually one of the first anime things I ever saw
<Kimori> thanks
<Bronysith> the first anime i ever saw was sailor moon
<Barbetos> http://i.imgur.com/UX4Ikh.jpg Love this game so much.
<Shizuka> 13that offramp is horrible design
<Kimori> I think its just the stress :/ I still havent finished all my moving yet
<Zeus> fluttercry: wow what a way to start
<Kimori> my dads b-day is in a few days too, been thinking of that alot more
<Afflict> :(
<Goldframe> I think my first one was Ronin Warriors
<fluttercry> 05,15Well dressed man walking into a dirty basement to buy guns. Seems legit
<Goldframe> either that or the old DBZ ocean dubs
<Shizuka> first one i saw was sailor moon but the first one i paid attention to was elfen lied
<Zeus> Code Geass was my first
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka's colors are gone O///O
<Kandarihu> Technically, the first anime I watched ws Go Lion. But I had no perception of it being foreign. The first anime I watched while being aware of it being anime was Sailor Moon. And that's when I fell in love with anime.
<Shizuka> actually
<Shizuka> hm
<Shizuka> actually my first anime was speed racer
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Shizuka is nekked
<Shizuka> i always forget speed
<fluttercry> 05,15Cowboy Bebop was the first thing I saw. Then Akira. Then Princess Mononoke
<Bronysith> code geass is a load of Meh
<Shizuka> ja but my eyes are not liking my pink atm..
<twilight_sprinkle> code geass>gurren lagan
<fluttercry> 05,15dat Full Metal Alchemist
<Goldframe> L'arc, nice
<Bronysith> death note couldve been the perfect anime, if it ended after L died
<otakon> ah FMA
<AssaultWithEmbraces> this the full version, Sumi?
<Zeus> Bronysith: lets agree that FMA is the best?
<otakon> FMA: B was better though
<Bronysith> Death note is just a breeding ground for yaoi fangirls
<fluttercry> 05,15FMA was great. I haven't seen Brotherhood yet
<twilight_sprinkle> it was far from perfect before l died
<Bronysith> Zeus: huh? fuck no, it is great, but not the best
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I saw Conqueror of Shamballa
<twilight_sprinkle> first anime i saw was shaman king though
<Shizuka> oh i haven't seen that either
<fluttercry> 05,15Nope. I've been busy with Evangelion and Black Lagoon
<Goldframe> Brotherhood is just FMA's version of Hellsing Ultimate
<Shizuka> i watched FMA but felt it ran waaaaaaay too long
<Zeus> fluttercry: brotherhood is better imo
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Brotherhood is like a side-story to the original
<otakon> BROTHERHOD IS BEST!
<Shizuka> 52 eps is just too long for a single arc
<otakon> Shizuka: Brotherhood is 65 eps but it's GOOD well paced
<Bronysith> Evangelion and Gurren lagann are my fav animes though, short and sweet and utterly awesome
<Shizuka> gah
<AssaultWithEmbraces> It sorta goes more in-depth into everything that happened imo
<Bronysith> except evangelion, just pure ass
<Kandarihu> fluttercry, Brotherhood is the source material handled properly
<otakon> Shizuka: c'mon GIVE IT A CHANCE!
<otakon> Kandarihu: thank you
<Kimori> Ive just been trying to keep my mind on other things
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dat rubber burning
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> do you have the movies too Sumica ?
<twilight_sprinkle> ive never even seen FMA
<fluttercry> 05,15As long as Brotherhood doesn't get like Bleach where EVERYTHING is filler and boring. I'm okay with it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and The Sacred Star of Milos ?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Pretty loud stereo system in that car
<Zeus> fluttercry: brotherhood follows the manga more than the original
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: it is fucked up
<Goldframe> Brotherhood follows the manga more as opposed to the first fma series
<Barbetos> Da shoes
<Barbetos> Its probably the shoes
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: more than eva?
<fluttercry> 05,15It might be the glasses or shoes
<NocturnalBlade> i forgot what anime i first watched...was it sailor moon? hmmm
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i mean, not as fucked up as evangelion,
<Shizuka> and then the clothing store was across the street
<Kandarihu> fluttercry, FMA = DBZ. FMA:B = DBKai
<Shizuka> niko is haruhi
<AssaultWithEmbraces> That parking
<Barbetos> Oh how nice of dem
<Barbetos> No you let him live
<Barbetos> You killed da black guy
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: 8 year old kid lost his body due to trying to transmute their mother back to life, he lost his entire body, his brother lost an arm and a leg
<Barbetos> I saw IT ALL
<NocturnalBlade> no you shot the bouncer lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: that sounds terrible to me....
<fluttercry> 05,15I wore the Obsidian suit with black loafers
<Zeus> Shizuka: if niko was haruhi then the world would have ended awhile ago
<Barbetos> The glasses!
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: the brother with his body transmuted his brothers soul into a suit of armor and now they try and find a philosophers stone to try and get enough power to get their bodies back
<Barbetos> Wow
<texasboykc09> bye everypony
<Barbetos> Nice parking.
<Mutterguy> back from filling my swiss account
<Zeus> sees ya texasboykc09
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: hm, well at least he has armor
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<Shizuka> BONK
<Kandarihu> I meant to say that the first anime went off in some strange direction halfway through, that just doesn't live up to the original. FMA Brotherhood is a straight adaptation of the original
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: he has no body, he cant eat or sleep or anything
<Zeus> you gonna sit through the whole interview like a champ?
<Barbetos> Thats how I take off my glasses too
<Barbetos> Before O go to bed
<thelonepony> I cant sleep ;_;
<Barbetos> You left us
<Barbetos> D=
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: how is he not dead then?
<Barbetos> Megic
<NocturnalBlade> thelonepony: why?
<fluttercry> 05,15It's the glasses. You can wear any suit and shoe combo but no glasses
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: cause his real body is held in the place between worlds waiting for his soul to come back and they can rejoin
<thelonepony> NocturnalBlade: becuase of this place of course :P
<fluttercry> 05,15The suit is fine
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: well if youre not tired then its ok. if you are, just relaxing in bed is good too
<Shizuka> why can't you just TAKE THE GLASSES OFF AND PUT THEM IN YOUR POCKET
<AssaultWithEmbraces> The game can't handle your classiness level
<Barbetos> You probably have to go back to a hideout and get rid of them
<otakon> what Shizuka said
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai everypony. Damn Niko, you're looking snazzy.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: edward used transmutation, sacrificing his arm, to seal his brothers soul into a suit of armor so he didnt lose him
*Shizuka is bein sneakeh
<NocturnalBlade> thelonepony: lol ^_^ i understand completly lol
<fluttercry> 05,15dat Shizu is a spah!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Shizuka: Where are your colors, why are you nekked
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: again, these kids were like 7 when they did this
<NocturnalBlade> ohai Petrified_Discord
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: hm well still, ive seen more messed up things
<Barbetos> Shizu well its cause it is stuck to his model
<thelonepony> Hi Petrified_Discord :)
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Free ride
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea, evangelion XD
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> YELLOW CAR
<fluttercry> 05,15TAXIIII CAAAAAAAB
<Barbetos> Blasting off again?
<Bronysith> but seriously, fuck FMA
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: and i read the script for a movie called antichrist. that is the most messed up thing ive ever read/saw/thought of
<Zeus> kill everyone in a bloody rage over suit?
<Shizuka> kill everyone in a bloody rage WITH a suit
<Zeus> ^
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Daaayum, Niko
<Barbetos> Drive from broker?
<Barbetos> No thanks
<otakon> lol
<otakon> it's a nice suit
<Mutterguy> it's very well starched
<Petrified_Discord> More like you can't see without your glasses :I
<Zeus> gta 6 felma's revenge
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and the Sumica was jhonny bravo
<otakon> ^
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I can't see shit without my glasses if it's more than 5 inches away from me
<Shizuka> >push guy
<Shizuka> >get cops
<otakon> lol I was about to say the same thing
<Barbetos> !!!
<Barbetos> lmao
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hooray for nearsightedness
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<fluttercry> 05,15HE PUSHED SOMENE! KILL HIM
<Zeus> stop you violated the law, pay with your blood
<AssaultWithEmbraces> lel
<Petrified_Discord> They only shot him LIGHTLY
<Bronysith> so 1 pint or what?
<thelonepony> Lel, indeed
<Bronysith> how much blood you want?
<Mutterguy> you're in deep shizu now Sumica
<Bronysith> 1 pint 2 pints?
<Bronysith> Sumica: does this bug you? does this bug you?
<Zeus> never should of shoved that dude now you got the national guard after you
<fluttercry> 05,15Obviously it's because you are a terrorist
<NocturnalBlade> that is did Sumica that is did :D
<Zeus> he is brown
<Shizuka> oh oh i know this track
<Shizuka> gah where do i know this track

<fluttercry> 05,15Is this Portal?
<NocturnalBlade> ooooo, so close
<twilight_sprinkle> no its lion king
<Zeus> what would the world be like if everyone drove like this?
<Shizuka> couldn't hear the lead synth cause volume is down
<Barbetos> Yes fluttercry
<Bronysith> fluttercry: what if i used this evoker?
<fluttercry> 05,15lol, I love how my ping is ACE DETECTIVE so now when I ask stupid questions, when I get answers, my ping makes fun of me!
<twilight_sprinkle> i think this is the ending song of portal 2 minus the chorus part
<Barbetos> Or get good exercise
<Barbetos> If you don't have a car
<Barbetos> Oh nice
<fluttercry> 05,15dat Final Fantasy 7
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> OH YES
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Aw,,,,]

<Bronysith> final fantasy 7 <3
<Zeus> what would niko's resume look like if he did it legit?
<Barbetos> lmao
<wipergone2> is tht portal 2?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> STUPID COPS
<Shizuka> that was 7? thought it was 8...
<Petrified_Discord> But he's in a suit!
<Bronysith> Shizuka: FALSE
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> BAD DAY BAD DAY
<fluttercry> 05,15No that's 7
<Shizuka> never did finish 8 the PC port was so rough around the edges
<Barbetos> Fatties!
<fluttercry> 05,15It's the boss music
<Bronysith> Final fantasy 7 is my fav final fantasy
<Bronysith> tied with 6 of course
<fluttercry> 05,158 is terrible no matter where you play it Shizu
<Bronysith> naturally
<twilight_sprinkle> those who fight further i think is the name
<Shizuka> i played through 7's port twice but probably wouldn't do it again without vm or maybe an emulator
<Zeus> jakie chan adventure reference for the win
<Mutterguy> now for approiate music!!!
<Shizuka> that's a stunt jump but you need the whole road to clear it
<Eddmario> So, whatchya talking abou?
<Bronysith> FF7 is a great introductory into the final fantasy franchise
<fluttercry> 05,15this mix sounds like Manheim Steamroller lol
<Shizuka> typical day on patrol for that guy
<Bronysith> then ff6 is the best one in the series though
<Barbetos> He was drunk and sent home mica
<NocturnalBlade> drunk on duty lol
<Shizuka> it might be OCremix
<Bronysith> and of course, chrono trigger kicks all of the final fantasies ass
<twilight_sprinkle> i only played ff7: crisis core which was great
<Bronysith> cause chrono trigger is perfect <3
<Shizuka> yeah pretty sure it's OCRemix
<fluttercry> 05,15Chrono Trigger was fantastic
<Bronysith> fluttercry: perfect
<Shizuka> i like what OCRemix did with the doom OSTs
<Mutterguy> that's actuually the blackmages
<Bronysith> fluttercry: i cosplayed as crono for dragoncon, funtimes

<Shizuka> okay that's a good look for niko
<Zeus> niko professional mediator
<Shizuka> still not as good as biker CJ though
<Soulless_DCLXVI> They do not
<sub06905> :D
<Phase4> its really wierd to see these guys arguing and somehow its all nico's job
<AssaultWithEmbraces> lolol
<fluttercry> 05,15Little Jacob was the best character in this game
<eraykaan> or can't use a jetpack like CJ
<Shizuka> < dude where's my car
<twilight_sprinkle> why would she want coke anyway, dr pepper is better
<Shizuka> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<Zeus> why cant elzabatha just get a new one out of the vending machine
<Buytoast> The gremlins strike again.
<Shizuka> or barqs
<Phase4> i alt tabbed away from my rocket
<Phase4> it went missing
<Shizuka> best canned root beer ever
<fluttercry> 05,15Pepsi>Dr.Pepper>Coke
<twilight_sprinkle> meh pepsi
<Zeus> ^
<JRP2234|Musics> mica llalalalalallalalalalallala
<sub06905> cream soda <3
<Buytoast> I prefer Mug root beer to be honest.
<twilight_sprinkle> never tried barqs tho
<Shizuka> have you guys seen those coke freestyle machines
<fluttercry> 05,15You guys have no idea how much I love pepsi
<Shizuka> with like ten thousand flavors on a touch screen
<SirFlutterTheShy> orphan tears...
<Shizuka> coke raspberry is actually pretty good
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka are those the computer ones with like a million flavors?
<Shizuka> wish it were a can
<eraykaan> do you want to hear the story of angry ponies?
<Shizuka> yeah
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah we have those around here
<fluttercry> 05,15Raspberry Coke and Orange Coke is really good
<sub06905> orange coke? wut
<Shizuka> coke raspberry reminds me of when mountain dew did that flavor contest long ago and had a raspberry flavor that didn't win
<twilight_sprinkle> ive not seen those unfortunately.i would use my creativity to make a vanilla with vanilla soda
<Zeus> Niko drivers no survivors
<AssaultWithEmbraces> No you've got it all wrong
<twilight_sprinkle> cause vanilla ftw
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Raspberry lime Dr. Pepper.
<fluttercry> 05,15We have one in the Five Guys and one in the Wendy's
<sub06905> cherry coke ftw
<Shizuka> orange is a bit strong, coke lime was like coke+sprite and really meh
<Buytoast> Vanilla Coke
<Buytoast> mmmm
<eraykaan> living w/ pinkie logic is better. you should try too
<Zeus> my preference is the correct one
<Shizuka> vanilla coke is good, cherry-vanilla Dr Pepper is fantastic
<fluttercry> 05,15All the flavored cokes except for Lime were good
<Buytoast> Vanilla makes everything better
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Raspberry.
<Buytoast> ice cream
<Buytoast> coke
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Lime.
<fluttercry> 05,15Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper tastes like original Dr.Pepper
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dr. Pepper
<fluttercry> 05,15this song....where have I heard it
<Buytoast> but Cream Soda is good stuff too
<Shizuka> dat white wedding
<JRP2234|Musics> mica isent this song in the game?
<Shizuka> also Dust
<sub06905> fluttercry: i think in sa
<Buytoast> everytime i hear this song i mistake it for take on me
<twilight_sprinkle> though after sports nothing tasted as great as orange fanta
<Shizuka> i tend to get it mixed up with rebel yell until the lyrics kick in
<fluttercry> 05,15Orange Fanta is good, Grape, not so much
<Shizuka> years of mom listening to the album in order throw me off :P
<Buytoast> man, i dunno why but i cant stomach fanta anymore
<Shizuka> grape drink is usually pretty eh
<Buytoast> now crush
<Shizuka> wish they'd bring pepsi blue back
<fluttercry> 05,15I can't drink too many fruit things though, they make me really REALLY sick
<twilight_sprinkle> grape fanta is meh, but i do love grape juice
<fluttercry> 05,15especially juices
<Zeus> take care theres a gook around every corner
<fluttercry> 05,15If you give me orange juice or apple juice, you're asking for trouble
<Shizuka> blue raspberry is the best flavor ever made
<Shizuka> perfect amount of sweet and tang
<sub06905> ^
<Buytoast> blue raspberry is pretty good
<twilight_sprinkle> my favorite fruit is pinapple, boy do i love me some pineapple~
<Shizuka> strawberry is a close second for my favorite flavor
<fluttercry> 05,15Combine that with my penchant for getting motion sickness and you have a recipe for terrible roadtrips
<Buytoast> but grape is right up there too
<fluttercry> 05,15Stupid Hotel breakfasts
<Shizuka> only time i get motion sickness is reading in a car
<Phase4> chain link fence thats not bulletproof?
<Phase4> what is this magic
<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate! :$
<Zeus> good programing
<Buytoast> how the hell do they know where you are?
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi MadSurge
<SirFlutterTheShy> What was that a bullet the the heart? pfff like I care.
<Buytoast> HE SHOT ME!
<Phase4> Snipings a good job mate
<Rommulus> Good morning MadSurge
<Zeus> MadSurge: top o the morning to ya
<Buytoast> HE'S OVER THERE!
<fluttercry> 05,15I get sick just 5 minutes into riding any moving vehicle. Planes, boats, cars, buses. I can't stand them
<Buytoast> What about trains?
<Shizuka> Buytoast: they're seeing the killcams duuh
<fluttercry> 05,15and trains. I rode a train to Bronycon and I felt like crap when I arrived
<Buytoast> damn shame
<Zeus> cnt get sorrounding when your a coward!
<Buytoast> love the tains
*Shizuka has been on a total of three plane trips, been on a boat twice, never been on a train
<Buytoast> except when the beligerant drunk people get on
<MadSurge> fluttercry: even bycicles? :D
<Buytoast> and the crazy homeless people
<fluttercry> 05,15I never learned how to ride a bike, but I assume the same thing would happen
<twilight_sprinkle> i do get motion sick in cars sometimes, but opening a window usually fixes that
<Shizuka> biking is mostly about using the wheels as a gyroscope
<Phase4> only in ksp can you make a vehicle more unstable by making it weigh less
<Zeus> night vision scope would be nice
<twilight_sprinkle> SURPRISE MUTHAFUCKA
<Shizuka> niko doesn't have enough certs for one
<Buytoast> Shoot the boats.
<Buytoast> They know too much.
<fluttercry> 05,15I can usually take being in a car, because it doesn't take long to get where I need to go and I can stop. But buses...oh god. Just riding the bus to the store is enough to ruin me for the rest of the day
<Zeus> my pet!
<Buytoast> to be honest, i'm scared of riding in a boat or plane
<Rommulus> I love boats and planes :D
<fluttercry> 05,15Scary part about planes is taking off and landing
<Buytoast> you capsize at sea your dead
<Zeus> Buytoast: superman says flight is always the safest method of travel
<Buytoast> you crash from the skies yer dead
<Rommulus> Cant stand buses however
<Shizuka> love takeoff, landing is a bit meh
<fluttercry> 05,15once you're in the air, everything is fine
<twilight_sprinkle> i would be fine with public transportation but theres too many weirdos there
<sub06905> i can imagine how fluttercry will feel after a rollercoaster ride
<Shizuka> takeoff is VROOOM and just when you think you can't go faster VROOOOOOM and then you're in the air
<fluttercry> 05,15sub06905 I actually love rollercoasters. Not sure why but that's a different experience
<Shizuka> i like rollercoasters but only with shoulder harness
<sub06905> oh
<fluttercry> 05,15Landing is like "OH GOD WHAT WAS THAT NOISE I'M GOING TO DIE"
<Shizuka> can't stand lap bar only ones
<fluttercry> 05,15Lap bars are scary
<Buytoast> WEIRDOS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT EH?
<Buytoast> You callin me out?
<Shizuka> air is fun... when i don't feel like i'm going to fly out of the car
<JRP2234|Musics> hey mica do you havce a webcam?
<Shizuka> i would use public transportation but i'm miles away from everything... there's one bus line through this area and it only stops at like 5am
<JRP2234|Musics> DAM IT
<fluttercry> 05,15I live a few minutes away from Busch Gardens, and the roller coasters are fun, but this one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo's_Chariot doesn't have shoulder harnesses. You have a lap square, not even a bar, that holds you in.
<JRP2234|Musics> ONCE AGAIN I WAS FOILED BY MICa PLANS
<Zeus> time for NOOSE action
<JRP2234|Musics> mica so they ported t6he gta 4pc to steam?
<MadSurge> fluttercry: do you walk everywhere then? :D
<fluttercry> 05,15no I ride. I just take dramamine all the time
<sub06905> dat chopper
<Zeus> wow took you all night to complete da task
<fluttercry> 05,15This is all you have holding inside Apollo's Chariot http://www.qcministries.com/images/extreme/2009_busch_1_600.jpg
<Phase4> did he just say "you're dead fred" ?

<JRP2234|Musics> Phase4 theres a meet up in mebloure on the 21st
<JRP2234|Musics> wow wtf is with my grammar
<MadSurge> fluttercry: your internal ear must be really sensible. Also that looks pretty unsafe
<JRP2234|Musics> maby im still a bit tired
<Zeus> its alright im a professional Niko
<Zeus> some many dead people
<twilight_sprinkle> its pretty amazing how this game manages to be both a fun more-or-less realistic shooter and a freeroamer, previous gta shooting always felt more like an arcade game of sorts
<JRP2234|Musics> SuperBrony64 where are you?
<fluttercry> 05,15Now Alpengeist, that's a rollercoaster I can get behind
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Hmmm, so I'm new to this whole thing so I honestly have no idea what to do...

<Saturn> 08,01MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
*twilight_sprinkle looks up rite of spring
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> I don't know why, but I always aim to run over the hookers in these games.:D
<twilight_sprinkle> hm this isnt so scary
<twilight_sprinkle> ive heard creepier music
<MadSurge> Ohai Saturn! :)
<MadSurge> Ambrosia_Firehoof13: they drop tons of money, maybe?
<sub06905> dat portal music :D
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Honestly I think it's just fun MadSurge.
<Zeus> but michelle your are my life, your are everything. your tearing me apart michelle
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<MadSurge> Ambrosia_Firehoof13: it's not like these games' civilians do anything to not make you want them dead :D
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> True.
<Alma> Will they ever make a GTA with a woman as the protagonist?
<Alma> Or a Rockstar game
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> I think that would be interesting.
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> That guy walks funny.
<Zeus> no amount of subtitles can ever make Jacob understandable that is why I repect him
<twilight_sprinkle> we should learn to speak like jacob and have rasta hours
<sub06905> lawl
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I dont know why but playing City escape or Speed Highway is fitting somehow
<Zeus> its harder than japanese i bet
<Goldframe> Vandread...nice
<Alma> Japanese is actually pretty easy as I am finding out
<Alma> Just a lot to remember
<twilight_sprinkle> im terrible at memorization >.<
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> I lived in Japan for six months a few years back.
<Alma> That is why mankind invented SRS
<Zeus> thats good to hear ive been mulling over taking a class
<Alma> You can not learn Japanese without a good Spaced Repitition System
<Zeus> this is from...Vandread?!
<twilight_sprinkle> Ambrosia_Firehoof13: did you like it?
<Goldframe> yup
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: Why does everything look grey?
<Goldframe> Trust
<Alma> The grammar is pretty straight forward and almost no exceptions
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Oh yeah. I loved it! I was there for Martial Arts training.
<Zeus> get off the phone your driving!
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Fail!!!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WELP
<sub06905> :D
<Buytoast> That trick was off the rails
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The trains will deal with that
<Zeus> se what happens when you talk and drive
<Alma> According to my SRS I already know 666 Radicals, Kanji or Vocabulary
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Run Bi*** run!!!
<Buytoast> thank goodness some other car was there to break your fall
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Not much better though.
<sub06905> planning to play chicken with the train sumi
<sub06905> ?
<Zeus> well if you were master chief you could just flip it
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What are we driving on?
<Buytoast> the edge
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> PHYSICS
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHY U NO WORK
<AbsoluteZero> GTA physics is best physics
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> I remember playing San Andres and running head on with the train. It smashed my car. *chuckles*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bethesda Physics is best physics
<Zeus> computer within a computer
<AbsoluteZero> go onto bronystate
<sub06905> http://inception.davepedu.com/
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Isnt there a instant 5 star site?
<Zeus> thats the best thing ive ever seen sub06905
<Zeus> six star and yes is for child porn
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Dead hooka!!!
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Oh nevermind...
<Zeus> perfectly executed
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> I would totally do that car...
<twilight_sprinkle> renboh dosh https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UhdXiMD8OLM/UM4nY69lxDI/AAAAAAAAYJE/QP-JiVrCfBw/s1600/RainbowWhy.png
<Zeus> the hood just flies off...
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Weee!!!
<MadSurge> Who is streaming anyway? Shizuka?
<Zeus> and no shits were given that day
<Shizuka> nope
<MadSurge> Sumica then?
<MadSurge> Yay! :D
<AbsoluteZero> footpaths are overrated
<Zeus> the road is lava
<Phase4> that took them a while
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Talk about car hops.
<Phase4> liberty city: this is why you dont hire fat people as cops
<Phase4> they cant run
<Shizuka> STOP OR I'LL WHEEZE
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Who needs insurance.
<Phase4> swingset?
<Zeus> perfect soundtrack for destruction
<Rommulus> What havent we done in a while?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: is that a jimmy neutron ref?
<Shizuka> no .-.
<twilight_sprinkle> k lul
<Shizuka> FLCL right?
<Zeus> yupp
<Zeus> oh god this?
<Phase4> Zeus, this is happening, deal with it
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Run 'em over!!!
<Zeus> Phase4: yes boss
<Rommulus> Physics....
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> What the heck just happened?
<twilight_sprinkle> hmm im thinking the swingsets are worthy of godhood
<Zeus> master chief it
<Shizuka> >where do you need assistance
<Shizuka> >the swingset
<Shizuka> >sigh... okay sir, but we're not responsible for property damage
<Phase4> this is odd
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Run forest run!!!
<Phase4> wheres the truck?
<Alma> is it illegal in the USA to walk around with a firearm in your hand?
<Shizuka> hey look the mach 5
<Alma> I mean, owning a gun is legal, right?
<Zeus> their there is five minutes or your money back
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Yes, aim for the cops and hookas.
<Shizuka> Alma: depends on the state, a few have concealed carry laws, i don't know any offhand that have open carry
<Phase4> the cop doesnt care XD
<AbsoluteZero> good park
<Alma> Once we had an american exchange student and he said he alone owned 5 guns in his family
<Alma> "But do not worry, 3 of them are just for hunting."
<Shizuka> probably a hunter ja
<Shizuka> different guns for different ranges and game
<Alma> "So, what about the other two..."
<Shizuka> defense
<twilight_sprinkle> killing animals for sport...
<Shizuka> food
<Alma> Because everyone owning a gun protects civilians from each other and the government
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Explosion!!!
<Shizuka> Alma: it's a deterrent, better for it to be there when you need it than not there
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Busted....
<JRP2234|Musics> What is mica
<JRP2234|Musics> baby dont sumi me
<thebikergorilla> love the music
<Alma> I am pretty sure it has more to do with the gun lobby doing a pretty good job of convincing everybody that guns are necessary
<JRP2234|Musics> OMG
<JRP2234|Musics> THE SWING SET
<Shizuka> Alma: yes because only law abiding citizens commit crimes
<Alma> Why is this guy so obsessed with this playground
<Phase4> cops having his coffee
<Phase4> to busy to enforce the law
<Alma> lol, fat american cap
<Alma> *cop
<Shizuka> cop needs to get out and play more
<Alma> Why would you even have a fat policeman
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> And it still lives...
<Shizuka> swingset was not amused with your antics
<Phase4> nice shot
<Phase4> this car can take a beating
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> HOW IS THIS STILL DRIVING
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> HOW
<AbsoluteZero> i like ur wrek
<Zeus> got a few dings she'll run fine
<twilight_sprinkle> its a glitch
<Shizuka> as long as the wheel can get some friction on the ground, it works
<Phase4> its funny cause the cops still cant catch you
<Alma> I also never understood how the police in the USA can do car chases. Just let the helicopter chase him
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> 'Tis but a scratch.
<Phase4> ^
<JRP2234|Musics> wtf mica
<JRP2234|Musics> YOUR CAR
<Shizuka> Alma: because a helicopter can't detain
<Alma> In every other country it would be illegal for the Polica to endanger the public by having a car chase
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Seriously half the car is missing
<JRP2234|Musics> HOW THE FUCK IS IT DRIVABLE
<Shizuka> police car can spin you out or corner you, a helicopter can't do that without severely endangering the pilot and anything in the vicinity of the helicopter
<twilight_sprinkle> its a part of the swingset glitch
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> I don't think it's gonna get much farther...
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Flip it!!!
<Zeus> Alma: id talk to a us cop bought dat sort of thing see what he says
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> FLEE
<Alma> I actually do would like to hear their response
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Run Forest!!!!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Nope
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Lowrida!
<Alma> In PayDay The Heist the police is putting the lives of the hostages more at risk than the robbers^^
<Shizuka> i miss how SA did motorcycle hijacks
<Shizuka> just kick the guy off the seat
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> ALL HIS PANTS ARE LOW RIDAS
<Shizuka> niko's all polite, has them pull over, step off, then drives away
<Zeus> Alma: on the same level I would get your research from games nd movies
<twilight_sprinkle> the vice city story game had a neat motocycle hijack where you jump and kick the driver with two feet and land in the seat
<Zeus> wouldn't*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: More swingset shenanigans?
<Shizuka> oh sure enough, and then rebel yell X3
<Shizuka> sumi wants to confuse me about which billy idol song is on
<Alma> Zeus: lol, yes, I do believe this game is completely accurate
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So why is this swingset so glitchy?
<Zeus> Alma: lol i mean wouldn't
<Shizuka> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: you can see what it's doing when he collides, for some reason the swingset is a physics object
<Shizuka> but part of it is pinned, and when you slam into it you're pushing it into the world
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I'm guess someone in the coding department forgot to fix it
<Shizuka> physics and collision engines want it out, which causes it to snap
<Shizuka> it's all glitch
<Shizuka> or for all we know it's intentional
<Zeus> will it still work without swings?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Shizuka: Yea programers love to do that shit
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WOAH
<Phase4> i cant really imagine them not finding this
<twilight_sprinkle> those are some neat seats
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WELP
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> NICE SHOT
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> WEEEEE!!!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> AND HE STICKS THE LANDING
<AbsoluteZero> do a barrel roll
<twilight_sprinkle> nah, you aint seen nothin yet
<Phase4> gently does it
<Shizuka> my guess is the swings are physics objects that are pinned to the world, but the frame isn't, it's just pinned to the swings maybe
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> 50 bonus points!
*SpadeKyurem[WoW] gives Sumica 10 points
<Zeus> Phase4: well its for fun i would leave it if I were them
<twilight_sprinkle> nooooow were talkin
<Shizuka> but at such a height that it's on ground, maybe the swings were supposed to be destructible like light posts
<Phase4> Zeus, probably what happened
<Alma> I want to see a future GTA. In New New York
<Phase4> ^
<Phase4> FUND IT
<Shizuka> but because the whole thing isn't pinned like the rest of the playground, it's a big tension glitch
<Zeus> the new feat in german engineering, the crapmobile
<Alma> And you are playing Bender
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> How is this car driveing at all?
<Zeus> yeah dude
<Phase4> that and carmagedon
<Alma> This object stopped being a car a long time ago
<Shizuka> Sumica: inb4 giant ramps at the airports again
<Goldframe> how in the hell is that still running?
<Phase4> they need a carmagedon cheat
<Zeus> Goldframe: lots of love
<twilight_sprinkle> Goldframe: its a part of the swingset glitch
<Alma> lol
<Shizuka> unless they're building the physics engine from the ground up for 5, i'm sure wheel friction will still be a thing
<Shizuka> whether they bounds check it for negative values or not is a different story
<Phase4> fear the zombie car
<Alma> I would have bought Max payne 3 but then I found out about Social Club...
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> That patch sounds dreadful.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Cool guys dont look at explosions
<Shizuka> they just turn around and walk away
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Yay!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Zeus> cool guys dont have eardrums to ruin
<Phase4> i like how the swingsets idly make noise
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> They have cool guy errands to walk to
<Phase4> their meer presence is bugging out the physics engine
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Did anyone else hear that random girly scream from the game?
<Shizuka> niko's got a little captain in him
<Phase4> Ambrosia_Firehoof13, it happens
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> It's funny too.
<Zeus> new brand of beer captain niko
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Run fatty.
<Alma> I am excited for Watch Dogs
<Moopy> Hey yall
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Sup?
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Moopy
<Shizuka> you can see where the frame is pinned, right up in the middle A frame
<Moopy> hoi
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> That did't work as well as you wanted it to.
<Shizuka> so i wonder if it works even better if you push the left or right leg out of line
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Curb check!
<Moopy> Dang hes still not here? jeese
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Is this the only swingset in the game>
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> ?
<Shizuka> there's five i think?
<Shizuka> but this is the only one with good results
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I wonder why
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WOAH
<Shizuka> or there was another one in the new jersey side but sumica hasn't unlocked that zone yet
<Zeus> nice
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Nice.
<AbsoluteZero> that looked painful
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> And you live through the hell!
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Best flight ever.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I wonder why this is the fucked up one
<Zeus> your blood will forever stain that wall be proud
<naturesfury> wtf..
<AbsoluteZero> killed by swingset
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> WEEE!!!
<Shizuka> well from what i've read, they're all glitchy, but this is the only one with good positioning and angles of attack to launch you a good distance
<Zeus> critical mission failure
<Phase4> i think you fell through the world
<Shizuka> the others just punt you around the playground from what i hear
<Alchemist> Hai guys
<Zeus> do they ever come?
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Annoying secretary voice,,,
<Zeus> Alchemist: hey dude
<Alchemist> Shizuka: where did your color go?
<Goldframe> woot! Through the Night!
<Zeus> Outlaw Star?
<Shizuka> outlaw star right?
<Shizuka> yeah
<Zeus> ^
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Its almost 3 AM and I'm watching Sumica stream, what am I doing with my life...

<Phase4> which i know little about
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> PFFF
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], pony
<Shizuka> there needs to be a mod that removes the jungle gym from the center
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> FAIL!
<Shizuka> let you get a running start to the swings
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> SHIIIT
<Phase4> Shizuka, why stop there? remove the walls too
<Zeus> ITS GOOD
<Phase4> aproach the swingset from any angle
<AbsoluteZero> no-one really needs a spine
<Alchemist> video game physics for the win.

<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Blah, blah, blah.

<Phase4> theres probbaly some specific position that causes the flinging
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Shizuschlafen: Stop loafing around

<XAX> last weekends episode was so average
<XAX> the writer has apparently only seen lauren's notes and the first 2 episodes
<Moopy> i have my skull candy ear buds plugged in my computer speakers here
<XAX> if she actually knew much about the show, she would have written RD as being nervous as phuck before she got that letter, instead of LEL SO CHILL I GOT THIS.
<Ambrosia_Firehoof13> Well, it is officially 4:30 in the morning and I've gotta get open my restruaunt at 10am. Goodnight all!!!
<Zeus> XAX: didnt seem that out of character to me
<MadSurge> ^
<Phase4> Sumica, https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/ksp/Bugprobe.craft
<Alchemist> XAX: it was the same person who wrote Mysterious mare do well, Dragon quest, Hearth's warming eve and Putting you hoof down.
<Phase4> why does it keep doing that :/
<JRP2234|Musics> mica lazy
<XAX> the door in front of my desk that leads outside is open, and there's a cold wind out.
<XAX> but it's still hot.
<XAX> ;_;

<Alchemist> XAX: I dont really have that many problems with those episodes.
<Phase4> ship
<Phase4> Sumica, launch, turn on sas and rcs, then press h
<Zeus> XAX: to each his own I can see where your coming from
<XAX> yeah. opinions be opinions.
<Alchemist> XAX: I actually liked Hearths warming eve and putting your hoof down.
<Phase4> k
<XAX> Hearths was alright
<Phase4> moah engines XD
<XAX> infact
<Phase4> also theres a debug menu where you can force this to work
<XAX> the only episode written by MMW that i didnt like was mare do well.
<Zeus> i like canon history lessons so Hearth was a treat
<Alchemist> XAX: but I agree that wonderbolts academy wasnt an outstanding ep.
<Rommulus> Did Wrek finish the picture last night?
<Zeus> holy crap
<Phase4> this craft will go somewhere
<JRP2234|Musics> mica mrbean.jpg

<Phase4> it has to be EXACTLY centered
<Phase4> you can use the keyboard shortcut for symetry
<Phase4> x and shift+x
<Phase4> two symetry then line them up
<Phase4> you placed a few more than 1 :P
<Phase4> that should make it interestingt
<Gold_Demona> A solar flower? :D
<Phase4> not exact enough :P
<Phase4> it'll probably hit the bug either way
<Phase4> was fairly close
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Phase4> yeah, something you've installed has stuffed its up
<Phase4> bugs gona be fixed in 0.18.2 so
<Phase4> that looks scary
<Gold_Demona> Ooo

<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DOL55oVh1M :P
<AdamTheDuck> I'm really starting to love When The Clouds :3
<XAX> spight: If I were on the PC, I would link you a google doc with links to all of the episodes in 1080p (except 3) with no hub watermarks.
<XAX> But I'm not on the PC.
<XAX> So bad luck. :c
<spight> :(
*AdamTheDuck licks XAX
<spight> Well, feel free to link me any time you get on it.
<Vivix> iTunes and dvd of s1
<spight> This is my bouncer, so I'll be on all day.
<Vivix> though, s2 and s3? youtube-
<spight> Unless, of course, the host server goes down and my FRIEND doesn't make sure my server comes back up. ._.
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, anyone know where I can buy season 1 on DVD? .-.
<Vivix> AdamTheDuck, ah it sounds good~~
<spight> Not at walmart apparently.
<Vivix> I just got mine, Amazon.com
<spight> I wanted to get it as a "gag/Iwantyoutowatchthis" gift for my cousin
<Kandarihu> Still Ustream
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, ess bee was streaming before :P
<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, oh, I see

<spight> Ok
<spight> So
<spight> who wants what for Christmas? '-'
<spight> Does anyone else find it ironic that no delivery businesses are open on Christmas?
<spight> I feel like they could do something amazing with that.
<spight> You know, like dress up as Santa.
<AdamTheDuck> I want a real poneh dyed purple for Christmas .-.
<AdamTheDuck> And I shall name her Twilight Sparkle

<MadSurge> aniderp|bestcakeever: what happened? :(
<spight> I wouldn't mind seeing that image with more of my time
<aniderp|bestcakeever> everything
<AdamTheDuck> Cheer up, maybe Derpy will cheer you up http://fav.me/d57b6ki
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i lost my laptop
<AdamTheDuck> How are you on aniderp|bestcakeever? :<
<MadSurge> aniderp|bestcakeever: D:

<spight> Well.. :(
<XAX> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cu7HxG6-88
<XAX> is good song
<AdamTheDuck> You shouldn't hate people aniderp|bestcakeever
<AdamTheDuck> You should lick them instead
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i cant lick people
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Would you mind giving details instead of vagueness? >.>
<spight> You probably shouldn't lick people en masse, actually.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> they will say im not a pet but im a wolf
<spight> You'll end up spreading disease between people. :(
<aniderp|bestcakeever> well my mother got mad and took my laptop
<aniderp|bestcakeever> then i took if for few mins yesterday to log off my things
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and she said i stole it >.>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> now i lost it for today/tonight
<spight> And now you're sneaking on? =/
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i cant deal with the seperation...
<spight> It's not that bad if you can find something else to keep yourself occupied.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i guess she dont care if i cry :\
<Ponies47> Gotta run. Bye :I
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47
<aniderp|bestcakeever> how do i get on the pony irc on my ipod?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> like this irc
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp|bestcakeever, download an IRC app, although I don't know of any decent ones
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i tried to come on here using quakenet and it didnt work
<spight> I don't think iOS has any decent IRC apps. :(
<Gold_Demona> Why did your mom get mad, aniderp|bestcakeever?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> she blames me and my father
<XAX> spight: colloquy is the one I'm using
<XAX> its alright.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: For.....?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> then my fatger was odd last night and said he loved me
<Gold_Demona> Blames you for what?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> stressing her out
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im more stressed than her :\
<spight> But what did you do?
<Gold_Demona> Question, how old are you aniderp|bestcakeever?
<XAX> Gold_Demona: I turned 16 2 days ago and what is this
<Jmo> I didn't know your name was aniderp XAX.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<aniderp|bestcakeever> 20
<spight> XAX, you were born after The Lion King came out. :(
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ;_;
<XAX> Jmo: .-. themoreyouknow.jpg
<Gold_Demona> spight: You just blew my mind...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> well she said i do trash and i sorta did but like my ipod was in my hand..
<Gold_Demona> There are folks here younger tahn The Lion King... ._.
<Gold_Demona> than*
<spight> Yeah.
<spight> ^^;;
<Vivix> When did Lion King out? 93-94?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i didnt wanna drop it then my dad threw the bin in after me but it hit my ankle
<spight> there were folks in her who weren't alive a the same time Kurt Cobain was. :(
<aniderp|bestcakeever> lion king mufasa ;_;
*Vivix was, but don't remember Kurt
<AdamTheDuck> Why does everything look awesome/cuter with a hat? .-. http://fav.me/d5oe04w
<Vivix> heh
<spight> Because the top of every head looks dumb.
<Vivix> e
<Vivix> I like fluffy heads-
<spight> Fluffy hats
<aniderp|bestcakeever> the top of my head is dumb?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but work wont let me wear hats ;_;
<aniderp|bestcakeever> in the summer
<aniderp|bestcakeever> how do i get my mother to cave in to letting me have it back?
<spight> better make sure to keep your hair long, then!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> it is long
<_Dark_Moon_> Hi guys
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Be really nice and do stuff for her? I dunno.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i tried
<aniderp|bestcakeever> she still mad ;_;
<Gold_Demona> Without crying?
<AdamTheDuck> Hello _Dark_Moon_
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but isnt crying a guilt thing?
<spight> Don't expect to just have the magic words or something to make her cave in.
*Jmo facedesks
<_Dark_Moon_> so what's going on?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: guilt thing?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i tried please a million times
<Jmo> "If I cry will she feel guilty"
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i did the cans and bottles ad made me feel funny
*AdamTheDuck pushes a pillow on Jmo's desk
<_Dark_Moon_> Jmo: that does'nt work on anyone i know e_e
<spight> have you tried calming down and figuring out why she's upset in the first place, then doing something to make up for it? '-'
<Gold_Demona> ^
<spight> You'd still be without for a while
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i tried
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i cleaned my room a bit >.>
<XAX> I got a new mouse pad today. It smells nice.
<spight> You cleaned your own room?
<_Dark_Moon_> aniderp|bestcakeever: what's the prob? i only arrived a sec ago :P
<spight> And you expect that to actually make her happier? :Dc
<aniderp|bestcakeever> yes ;_;
<Jmo> >_>
<Gold_Demona> You can't expect immediate results. Have you tried asking her what it'll take to get the laptop back?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> well the bins are in the closet
<aniderp|bestcakeever> since she wants them there >.>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> why is my life hard? :\
<spight> Try cleaning elsewhere. She sounds like she's just stressed.
<_Dark_Moon_> Agreed with spite :\
<spight> Try to do something that will let her take her mind off of something at least.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> she says im lazy..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i work mon-friday
<aniderp|bestcakeever> how is tha lazy?
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh I need to get some sleep /).(\
<Gold_Demona> You don't do anything at home. Moms usually equate that to lazy. =/
<AdamTheDuck> Night everyone...
<Gold_Demona> night Ducky
<Vivix> Niight adaam
<Jmo> I'm sure you need sleep.
<_Dark_Moon_> AdamTheDuck: night
<aniderp|bestcakeever> who needs sleep?
<spight> Tired animals.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> my father wouldnt let me take a walk yesterday :\
*SuperBrony64 hugs aniderp|bestcakeever
<_Dark_Moon_> I am out of the house alot so i don't bother my parents .. :\
<Gold_Demona> I don't even live with my parents, so I don't deal with any of that. =/
<aniderp|bestcakeever> its causde i was crying and wanted to take walk
<Gold_Demona> Only other person I live with is my husband
<spight> I live with a roommate.
<_Dark_Moon_> I play alot of football so im always nearly out
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: When you say you cry, is it crying "to make them feel guilty" or is it actual genuine crying?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i was actually crying
<Gold_Demona> Cause guilt trip crying never ever ever ever works.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i wanted to leave the house yesterday while i was crying
<aniderp|bestcakeever> he wouldnt let me :\
<spight> I got really drunk at Ren Fest and ran away from all of my friends while I was having a panic attack in the middle of the night.
<spight> Then my phone died... ._.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Night all :)
<_Dark_Moon_> SuperBrony64|Zzz: night
<Gold_Demona> Night super
<spight> Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<_Dark_Moon_> Sleeping? it's like 1pm where i am
<XAX> Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<spight> Right in the middle of the UK, _Dark_Moon_ ?
<XAX> _Dark_Moon_: It's 2:20am Tuesday here.
<_Dark_Moon_> Im in Ireland.
<XAX> CUM ON STEP IT UP
<XAX> lol
<spight> I live in Texas, but I go by UTC in everyday life. :Dc
<_Dark_Moon_> It's 1pm Monday here
<aniderp|bestcakeever> do you think my parents care about me? :\
<spight> Yes
<spight> If they didn't, they would let you do whatever you wanted.
<Gold_Demona> ^
<aniderp|bestcakeever> thats why my father didnt want me taking a walk?
<Gold_Demona> There was probably more on his mind.
<Gold_Demona> We don't know the whole story.
<spight> If you're crying and upset, it's not normally safe to go outside and take a walk.
<_Dark_Moon_> My da does'nt let me go and play football in the rain e_e
<Gold_Demona> You don't know what's going on on their side of the field, so all you're seeing is your own problem.
<_Dark_Moon_> But i guess it's a good cause, i'd prob break my leg on the ground out there in the frost :P
<_Dark_Moon_> Im a goalkeeper so i don't leave one half of the field :\
<aniderp|bestcakeever> me upset and crying means i p[robly wouldnt come home until the night tbh :\
<Gold_Demona> I'm talking about parents
<aniderp|bestcakeever> then they would actually worry about me :\
<_Dark_Moon_> Oh right.. i get confused
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: if it was my mom it would be one quarter my fault, three quarters her being pissed about something else :D
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: That's childish
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i would be at the park..
<Gold_Demona> Making someone worry on purpose is childish.
<Gold_Demona> And it serves no purpose
<aniderp|bestcakeever> well if they mad then i wanna leave them alone..
<Gold_Demona> Then don't interact with them. Let them cool down for a while. Do some chores while you're at it.
<_Dark_Moon_> If my parents are mad i leave them alone for a while and make it up to them somehow.
<XAX> If my parents are mad... I just sit on the computer like I usually do.
<Gold_Demona> Also, being outside while your crying and upset makes you an easy target for crime.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> it would be?
<XAX> inb4 why not use it instead of sitting on it
<_Dark_Moon_> Lol xax..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> well im depreseed if i dont have my eletronics..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> or my laptop
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: That's something you're gonna have to fix.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> how?
<_Dark_Moon_> All i need is football, peeps and some sleep to make it the best day ever.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i need them though...
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: No. You need to get that "need" word out of that figure.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> how? D:
<aniderp|bestcakeever> they calm me down..
<Gold_Demona> Find another outlet.
<spight> Practice moderation
<Gold_Demona> ^
<spight> It's really, really easy to get addicted to electronics.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> moderation is going to work for a bunch of hours then coming home and being on laptop for rest of night
<aniderp|bestcakeever> or is that not?
<Gold_Demona> What you need is a wider range of activities.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> handhelds?
<_Dark_Moon_> im getting confused.. im just gonna sit back and hope something makes sense to me
<spight> Honestly, my kindle does wonders for getting away from the computer for a bit
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Books. Crafts. Puzzles.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i dont get the freedom other people my age do :\
<spight> Nobody does when they're living with their parents.
<Gold_Demona> ^
<aniderp|bestcakeever> so videogames is all i got
<spight> Try to take a break from them whenever you can.
<spight> Between games of League of Legends, I do a quick work out normally.
<spight> Or some chores.
<Gold_Demona> Chores are a good way to kill time. Plus it's productive
<spight> Not only does it get my mind off of the game for a bit, but I come back and do better in game since my blood's pumping harder. '-'
<MadSurge> I started taking swimming lessons again
<spight> I want to swim..
<spight> I'm just not confident enough to be without full clothing. ._.
<Gold_Demona> I don't. It's too cold where I am right now.
<spight> I love swimming during winter.
*aniderp|bestcakeever sighs
<MadSurge> Tiresome but it's the only sport I like to practice :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i shoudl go ;_;
<spight> If only my apartments would keep the pool clean. :(
<MadSurge> aniderp|bestcakeever: later :(
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Well, good luck. =(
<spight> aniderp|bestcakeever, have a good day.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> maybe i get it back tonight hoprfully..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> or im gonna cry and sleep depressed when i get home
<_Dark_Moon_> aniderp|bestcakeever: best of luck to you, bud.
*aniderp|bestcakeever hopes she will have a good day a work..
<Jmo> Well that session is finally over. Lovely.
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Saturn> 08,01i should really work
<Saturn> 08,01but reddit
<spight> Saturn:
<spight> My friends bought me a Rarity hoodie for Christmas. ._.
<Saturn> 08,01oh! nice!
<spight> I'm too happy. :(
<Saturn> 08,01i just received a Calvinball hoodie i bought
<Saturn> 08,01spight: no such thing as too happy!
<spight> Nice
<spight> Practice happiness in moderation
<Saturn> 08,01though, i came out of the other side of happy the other day
*spight stifles an inappropriate comment.
<Saturn> 08,01i was at a brony meet, and i think my brain just overloaded with happy, and i suffered crippling depression for most of the next day
<spight> Yeah
<spight> I have this weird curve of happiness with my life
<spight> After I go to a con, I'm happy for a few days.
<spight> Then I realize that I hate life because I can't be the same way irl than I am at cons.
<spight> Then enough time passes and I forget that I like cons.
<Saturn> 08,01ah, post-con depression
<spight> Then I go to another
<Saturn> 08,01it's odd, because my con is such a big part of my life, it often spills out into my real life
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, most of my IRL friends at the moment are people who work for BUCK

<spight> So I get to go to another training class this week.
<Saturn> 08,01yay

<MadSurge> Whimsy Floof is still a great name

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Thanks. I like it. :$
<Saturn> 08,01it never forgave me.

<Wrek> 05aaand home
<Wrek> 05Saturn!
<Gold_Demona> ohai Wrek
<Wrek> 05the question i asked
<Wrek> 05what the name of that part of css is
<Wrek> 05it was on the test :C
<MadSurge> Hey Wrek!
<Wrek> 05so i had to guess
<Wrek> 05im probably not acing it now
<Wrek> 05casue all otehr questiosn i could answer >_>
<MadSurge> Awww :(
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: what answer did you put?
<Wrek> 05tag
<Saturn> 08,01i think it'd be more "attribute"? but srsly, i have no idea
<Wrek> 05attribute is what you put afterwards
<Wrek> 05say background-color:
<Wrek> 05and the value is then #FF0000
<Wrek> 05;
<Saturn> 08,01isn't that a property?
<Wrek> 05its been called attribute for the goign of the course so :|
<Saturn> 08,01hm, fair enough
<Saturn> 08,01this is an area of computing that doesn't interest me in the slightest
<Wrek> 05i cant blame you
<spight> Are you asking what "background-color" would be in css?
<Saturn> 08,01html/css is a horrible design methodology
<Wrek> 05no im askign what the name of #example would be
<spight> Selector
<Wrek> 05thank you
<Wrek> 05in other words
<Wrek> 05no ace
<spight> :(
<Gold_Demona> I only know enough html/CSS to tweak a pre-existing skin to do what I want. =/
<Saturn> 08,01Gold_Demona: same, pretty much
<Wrek> 05i liek it cause it lets me do http://i.imgur.com/yS4F7.jpg
<Wrek> 05even if as saturn said
<Wrek> 05horribru
<spight> I like it because I don't have to manually create the UI
<MadSurge> Oppression, with two s
<Wrek> 05dat typo
<spight> I've done that enough. html or other serialized UI formats ftw
<Saturn> 08,01html/css needs to be replaced, but i'm not sure with what
<_Dark_Moon_> back :\ what's going on?
<Saturn> 08,01hell, HTTP is kinda horrible too
<Gold_Demona> We're talkin' codey stuff
<Wrek> 05what does the HT stand for again?`
<Saturn> 08,01javascript should be replaced with a goddamn bytecode interpreter
<Gold_Demona> Hyper Text
<MadSurge> _Dark_Moon_: discussing stuff with Wrek and Saturn
<Wrek> 05right
<spight> It's almost like HTTP's horrible because it transfers HT :P
<_Dark_Moon_> coolio.
<Wrek> 05tp is trans protocol right?
<Wrek> 05and ml markup language?
<spight> yeah
<spight> Back off of my JS :(
<Wrek> 05i cant do java
<spight> It just... had a rough childhood
<spight> Ok?
<Wrek> 05ive managed to implement it to anotehr site i made
<Gold_Demona> Java's weeeeeird. >.>
<Saturn> 08,01i do actually like some things in javascript
<Wrek> 05but i cant code if from blank
<puffmuffins> hi
<Saturn> 08,01people give it a hard time, but it has some pretty nifty features
<Saturn> 08,01but i hate that it's what browsers force a programmer to use
<spight> Honestly, the biggest problem with the whole system is that there's no unified interpreter for any of it
<Wrek> 05but this
<Wrek> 05http://i.imgur.com/TXqPw.png
<Saturn> 08,01a bytecode interpreter with access to the DOM, or whatever other primitive system, would mak emore sense in this day and age
<Wrek> 05this i can do
<Wrek> 05:D
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: HAVE MY BABIES
<spight> Problem is how difficult such a change would be to adopt
<Wrek> 05thats only 33% zoom
<Gold_Demona> Wrek, you beast. That's looking awesome
<Wrek> 05its in A2 size 300PPI
<Saturn> 08,01spight: aye, exactly
<puffmuffins> hello
<Gold_Demona> hiyo
<Saturn> 08,01i think at best, what HTML *should* have been is an intermediate language
<spight> Imagine just being able to use the local machines environment to run code./
<Saturn> 08,01aye, exactly
<Wrek> 05i kinda like CSS
<Wrek> 05but i hate jumpign between html and css all the time
<spight> Just edit the stylesheets on the fly with Javascript~
<Wrek> 05albeit since i began usign css my html has onyl been a set of divs
<Wrek> 05nothing more
<Saturn> 08,01though sanboxed native execution is trickier than just sayin g"here's a VM spec to generate to. i don't care what language you're coming from."
<spight> Yeah
<spight> Installation of browsers would need to become more demanding of environment
<spight> And coders would need to tone back the local code or implement *serious* deprecation layer code.
<spight> x.x
<Wrek> 05but yeah still pissed that i didnt remember selector
<spight> Ok
<Wrek> 05if i had
<spight> Time for work.
<Wrek> 05id ace the test
<spight> See you guys
<spight> I'll send pictures of my rarity hoodie. :O
<Saturn> 08,01and instead of a markup language and a styling language, have a data language (JSON!), and a template language
<Wrek> 05speaking of test; writing code for hand is tedious >_>
<Wrek> 05by*
<Saturn> 08,01there, solved.
<Saturn> 08,01you can thank me in beer
<spight> You
<spight> Me
<spight> I get cold beer
<spight> You have warm beer
<spight> Meet at the pub
<spight> ten minutes
<_Dark_Moon_> ^
<spight> Btw
<Saturn> 08,01haha
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<spight> Oh yeah
<spight> :(
<Saturn> 08,01got wrek'd :P
<Saturn> 08,01come to scotland, spight; we have many a fine ale here
<spight> I would love a JSON markup language, btw.
<Vivix> I thought JSON just carried data
<spight> HTML just carries data too honestly.
<spight> HTJSON
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i'm off to write a branch predictor simulator
<spight> Kk. /
<Vivix> hm
<Vivix> well, I like it how it is now
<spight> The system is fine.
<spight> The browsers have ruined everything, though.
<Vivix> I wouldn't know- I never did html before past few months
<Vivix> so only ever done html5
*Bronysith glomps Vivix and takes him to bed
*Vivix screeches
<Wrek> 05i prefer mead really
<Vivix> All my interaction with JSON has been via faye-
<Wrek> 05theres this awesoem tavern in stockholm Saturn that has awesoem mead
<Bronysith> Wrek: what are you, a nord?
<Vivix> I only had mean once, didn't really think it was amazing
<Wrek> 05homebrewed from one of the out of town viking villages
<Bronysith> Vivix: i dont care for alchohol at all, if you like it, good for you XD
<Vivix> I don't either
<Vivix> I can drink it, but I don't really -- feel a need to
<Wrek> 05ok refresh so you see ustream
<Vivix> It's like, I would never go to a bar to drink juice, so I just- wouldn't go to a bar
<Bronysith> Vivix: lol
<Vivix> you know what I mean ;__;
<Bronysith> i know
*Vivix pats
<Wrek> 05guise
<Bronysith> if anyone needs me i am going to destroy the world
<Wrek> 05refreasj
<Bronysith> Wrek: i already did
<_Dark_Moon_> Same here
<Bronysith> and by destroy the world, i mean crush newbs in guild wars 2 XD
<Vivix> "And to do this, we made her boil her raggedy anne doll."
<Bronysith> but i am a newb in guild wars 2... fuck
<Bronysith> Vivix: what the hell
*Bronysith pushes EVA-01 ontop of Vivix
<Vivix> Aah
<Bronysith> im off
<Bronysith> see you sexy ponies later
*Bronysith throws down a smoke bomb
<Socks> Back, -ish
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: sup.
<puffmuffins> well im leaving
<Socks> Da sky, generally
*Socks waves goodbye to puffmuffins
<_Dark_Moon_> Good one.. it usually ia.
<_Dark_Moon_> is*
<_Dark_Moon_> ooo .. it looks like Doom
<Gold_Demona> Sounds like Doom too
<Socks> <3 Doom
<_Dark_Moon_> Lol wrek .. fist powaa
<Socks> *sigh* chat is quiet today
<_Dark_Moon_> ^ :|
<Suzano> Hello Bronystate *coaths*
*Socks stabs Suzano for some entertainment
<Suzano> whoa... old game is old?
<Socks> Hi :P
<_Dark_Moon_> Suzano: It looks like Doom right?
<Suzano> to be honest havent seen doom 1 XD
<_Dark_Moon_> XD
<_Dark_Moon_> For some reason i cant' stop playing Timesplitters 2 lately :\
<Socks> I'd say Doom 1 holds up today, it just has a charm that a lot of games don't have
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: first fps i suppose? and it's not overadvertised crap like Call of Duty
<Socks> It wasn't the first FPS, I think wolfenstein was first, but that doesn't hold up and is genuinely quite dull, Doom just has a charm :)
<Suzano> yeah... same as Duke nukem 3d.... Duke Forever had balls of butter
<Jmo> Pffft, Wolfenstein 3D or gtfo.
<_Dark_Moon_> Duke Forever.. development for like 15 years and it was still really bad :\
<Suzano> ot wasnt bad... it was TERRIBLE
<Socks> Can't say I'm surprised, or disapointed, I mean Duke Forever went into production a year after I was born, I have zero attatchment to the series.
<_Dark_Moon_> It was disgustingly terrible.
<Suzano> and i was getting sohyped
<_Dark_Moon_> Suzano: ikr, i bought it thinking it's gonna be the shit and it turned out as one of the worst games i ever played
<Suzano> Dem loading screens right?
<_Dark_Moon_> Don't even want to talk about the damn loading
<_Dark_Moon_> The whole gameplay altogether felt like a sega genesis :\
<Socks> Wait for price to go down and reviews to come in before buying a game!
<Socks> Rule of life
<Suzano> the levels were linear as hell to
<Socks> THe only one you need
<_Dark_Moon_> My all time fav game : Sonic 2
*Socks can't stand sonic games ¬_¬
<Suzano> I realy enjoyed Abes oddysey and Abes Exodus for PS1 :D
<_Dark_Moon_> Not sonic 2..
<_Dark_Moon_> Sonic 2 was a classic for the Megadrive :)
<Socks> The Megadrive sonics are too cluttered the new ones have crap controls, I dislike all sonic games, I like the franchise, hate the acctual games.
<_Dark_Moon_> I never did like the new Sonic. he lost his old feel sort of.. now he's a douche
<Socks> Put sonic in the hands of a good writer and he's a good character.
<_Dark_Moon_> Socks: true that.
<Socks> He's just never been in the hands of a good writer...
<_Dark_Moon_> Instead he's in the hands of friggin' Sega writers who are people pulled off the street :\
<Rommulus> Hello all, how are we this fine morning / afternoon / night?
<MadSurge> I don't like platformers where you can't take your time and explore everything because the game expects you to run to pass some obstacles :|
<Wrek> 05fuck
<_Dark_Moon_> Nice going, wrek :)
<Rommulus> bad luck Wrek, better luck next time.
<Socks> MadSurge: Agreed
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I don't mind that if it's only for like a couple of levels in the game
<_Dark_Moon_> I have the sudden urge to grab my Megadrive and play Sonic 2.. i still have it :O
<Socks> Hi Rommulus
<Gold_Demona> Or if it's a Sonic game
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: well yeah, but not all the game
<_Dark_Moon_> I have alot of old games i can get alot of money for
*Socks has no old console :(
<Rommulus> how are you Socks?
<_Dark_Moon_> I have megadrive, SNES, NES and N64
<Gold_Demona> The oldest system I still have is my SNES.
<Gold_Demona> I left my Genesis at my mom's house when I moved out
<Socks> If I could choose 1 old console to have I would choose n64, the games on that were aweseome!
<Gold_Demona> And my old NES went to my cousins in Colombia years ago
<_Dark_Moon_> I still have the original Metal Gear Solid 1 for PS1 with manual, case and both disks in perfect condition..
<Socks> Rommulus: I iz gud :) How are you?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: or at least, the game should be completely based on the idea of running and not make side rooms you have to stop to look at
<Rommulus> I am pretty damn good actually, had a lovely nap and have been studying anatomy.
*Socks was born into the PS2 generation
<Socks> Nappy naps :)
<Rommulus> Now come on to see Wrek streaming ^.^
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Like Sonic?
<_Dark_Moon_> When was PS2 made again? 2001?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: ever heard of Chelnov-Atomic Runner? *obscure games ahoy*
<Gold_Demona> Nope
<Gold_Demona> Never heard of it
<Rommulus> Been up to anything today Socks
<_Dark_Moon_> snake, snake, snaaaaaaakeeee
<Socks> Not really, staving of the many hours until my inevitable death, is cool.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the whole game is like that, the protagonist always moves on his own, he can stop for about two seconds before the scrolling catches up to him and pushes him off to run again
<_Dark_Moon_> MadSurge: Sonic was'nt a scroll screen platformer
<Rommulus> Oh well, I guess we all kinda go into that mentality for a little while every once in a while.
<MadSurge> _Dark_Moon_: I'm talking about another gam in fact
<_Dark_Moon_> Oh which one?
<Socks> :P
<MadSurge> _Dark_Moon_: "Chelnov-Atomic Runner"
<_Dark_Moon_> Now that you think about it.. if i sold all my old consoles and games i'd get atleast 300 something
<_Dark_Moon_> Oh, never heard of it.
<Wrek> 05this was the first game to incorporate dual weilding in the fps genre
<Socks> Which game is Wrek playing?
<MadSurge> _Dark_Moon_: doesn't surprise me
<_Dark_Moon_> Oh crap.. steam validating my acc
<MadSurge> Socks: Marathon
<Rommulus> Why of crap Dark?
<Socks> THanks :)
<_Dark_Moon_> MadSurge: When was the game made?
*Socks hugs MadSurge
<_Dark_Moon_> I only played Sonic and Shooter games at a young age
<Rommulus> I use to play Spyro and Sonic games as a child. So fun.
<Alchemist> Wrek: I think Shadow Warrior and Blood both had dual wielding
<Suzano> omg spyro the 1st part wasepic
<_Dark_Moon_> Spyroo now i remember :D
<Suzano> but coulnt get one dragon free
<_Dark_Moon_> wait
<_Dark_Moon_> Crash Bandicoot 2
*moobull69 is away: nap time
<MadSurge> _Dark_Moon_: the arcade version is from 1988, but the Genesis version is from 1992 and is more polished/coherent
<Wrek> 05it also has the best weapon in fps history
<Rommulus> I forgot about Crash Bandicoot
<Wrek> 05the WST-EM combat shotgun
<_Dark_Moon_> Same here.. i LOVED CB2
<Wrek> 05a sawed off shotgun with a 1 hand reload
<Suzano> I still have Crash trilogy with team racing
<Wrek> 052 barreled
<Rommulus> However there was 1 game that topped everything for me and is still fun to this day
<Rommulus> I have played it so many times over it isnt funny
<_Dark_Moon_> The motorcycle level in Crash 3 .. omm
<Rommulus> Digimon World 1
*Socks loved the crash bandicoot series
<_Dark_Moon_> Who does'nt :)
<Gold_Demona> Rommulus: I've only played Digimon World 3. What's the first one like?
<Socks> <3 digimon
<_Dark_Moon_> I got 100% complete in Sonic 2 :O
<_Dark_Moon_> I mean
<Rommulus> Digimon World 1 was amazing! it topped all games afterward. Especially World 2 which I was SEVERLY dissapointed in
<_Dark_Moon_> Crash 2
<Rommulus> I still think it is the best Digimon game to date.
<pony_3940> hello internet people of the world
<Rommulus> Hello pony_3940
<Rommulus> The people of the internet world greet you.
<_Dark_Moon_> I was really upset when they made Crash talk in the newer games :(
<Gold_Demona> I might have to find the first game and try it out then. Cuz I really liked the third one.
<Socks> THEY MADE HIM TALK!
<pony_3940> thanks my new kind of friend who i'll never have any kind of personal friendship with
<_Dark_Moon_> He should'nt talk.. he's crash for god sake D:
<Rommulus> Making Crash talk is like making Gordon Freeman talk.
<Ace> hello there pony_3940 :)
<Rommulus> It just isnt right
<Wrek> 05i think atleast 1 here will recognize the rocket laucnher
<Wrek> 05no?
<Suzano> CF
<Suzano> XD
<Rommulus> It looks familiar Wrek but doesnt ring any bells sadly.
<_Dark_Moon_> Im just gonna call it Boss
<Gold_Demona> nyeh?
<_Dark_Moon_> To me it sorta looks like the Soldier from TF2 :\
<Wrek> 05Halo Combat evolved
<pony_3940> so who here really fancies megan fox?
<_Dark_Moon_> derfurg
<Rommulus> and that would be were I seen it before.
<Rommulus> I never actually played any of the Megaman series, how was it?
<_Dark_Moon_> Steam "validating" me to check im not a bot.. if i bought a load of games why df would i be a bot?
<Alchemist> this game looks like a duke 3d/shadow warrior/redneck rampage clone.
<_Dark_Moon_> Im not really into Megaman/earthworm jim really.. i never found those games fun
<pony_3940> do you guys prefer games or girls?
<_Dark_Moon_> girls. all the friggin' way
<Wrek> 05this game is basicalyl halo's grandad
<pony_3940> good lad do you like football as well?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Girls? What are they?
<Alchemist> is that even a question?
<_Dark_Moon_> Yeah mate im a keeper
<Ace> Rommulus: the megaman games are great. i belive megaman x street fighter is out now for free.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Are they like... a new game?
<Socks> Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
<MadSurge> Is it bad I like Megaman but only completed 1/2 and 9/10?
<pony_3940> what kind of level
<pony_3940> ?
<_Dark_Moon_> Whaddaya mean?
<Socks> Scoot-Scootaloo: All of my love
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Are they like boys but wierder?
<Ace> MadSurge: no, not at all.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> And what the hell is Football?
<_Dark_Moon_> Im in a A league team as a RB and substitue Goalkeeper
<pony_3940> scoot man turn the xbox off and get yourself a girl friend and dark as in the kind of team you play for?
<Socks> Scoot-Scootaloo: They have a bit more in places and a bit less than others
<_Dark_Moon_> Scoot-Scootaloo: :O:O:O:O
<Socks> Football that is :P
<_Dark_Moon_> How can u not know de footbaalzz?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Do you mean Handegg or Soccer?

<_Dark_Moon_> You play footie bud?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> pony_3940: Are girls like Xboxes?
<Rommulus> Scoot-Scootaloo: No but they do drag you away from the Xbox.
<_Dark_Moon_> You remind me.. flex some of the guns on the pitch during the match :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> EWWW then I don't like them >:/
<MadSurge> And ded
<pony_3940> well you put stuff in the disc drive if you see what i mean

<_Dark_Moon_> We already have a keeper
<_Dark_Moon_> If he gets injured,
<Scoot-Scootaloo> JRP2234|DooM: Halo, Combat Evolved
<JRP2234|DooM> seems legit
<_Dark_Moon_> I move out of RB and move in goal
<pony_3940> fair doos
<JRP2234|DooM> it looks like the doom engin
<_Dark_Moon_> And we're both good keepers

<_Dark_Moon_> Guys who's on steam?
<Stormy> two more tests
<Kimori> :/
<Stormy> and I have to finish a project by 1 today
<Kimori> next week = vacation?
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: be safe and don't get shot/blown up/etc.
<Stormy> After my test on tuesday
<Lyra`> im just going to indiana
<Rommulus> Wrek is, however he is afk atm _Dark_Moon_ so he put on some afk music for us.
<Stormy> which is pretty early in the morning, so I'll have most of that day free
<Kimori> oh yout real close then
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: ah, okay
<Lyra`> whats the worst that could happen, that i cant kill, seduce, or barter my way out of?
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Kimori> your*
<Stormy> yeah
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: muslims.
<Stormy> I'm not happy about my grades though =/
<BladedWings> hi Lil_B
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: YEp
<Stormy> I really just could not make myself care this semester
<Sylandest> Lyra`: I was just in Indiana yesterday
<Lyra`> salam alah melekum
<Saturn> 08,01my god, that was actually horribly racist
<Kimori> Well its also because your professor was an ass right?
<Lyra`> it was
<Lil_B> thanks BladedWings :)
<_Dark_Moon_> Im gonna go play some football
<_Dark_Moon_> Later everyone
<Saturn> 08,01i apologise to any muslims in here
<Lyra`> your comment was bad and you should feel bad
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: ye bee loking for the word islamist
<Stormy> that's definitely part of it :P
<Dark_Horst> thsoe are the nutjobs ones
<MadSurge> Later _Dark_Moon_!
<Stormy> most of my teachers annoyed me this semester
<AssaultWithEmbraces> A job
<Stormy> especially the systems dev one
<Lyra`> huh?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But I'm even having a hard time getting a job
<Lyra`> i didnt get kicked for italics?
<Stormy> that was the last time I'll ever have him though
<Lyra`> thast odd.
<Kimori> Are your grades passing?
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: most clients don't support italics
<Lyra`> really?
<Saturn> 08,01AssaultWithEmbraces: why can't you get a job?
<Stormy> Yeah, they're not terrible
<Saturn> 08,01indeed.
<Stormy> but not good either
<Lyra`> i'll hire you AssaultWithEmbraces :3
<Lyra`> any experience being a maid?
<Lyra`> sans clothing.
<BladedWings> :D
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Saturn: Trying to get my first job and I have no job experrience
<Lyra`> just lie.
<Lyra`> always works
<Stormy> the worst I'll be getting is the low C in systems dev
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Lyra`, no experience at all
<Lyra`> say you worked on a farm
<Lyra`> or something
<Lyra`> you helped your parent growing up
<Saturn> 08,01or become an escort
<AssaultWithEmbraces> My dad worked at the paper mill
<Lyra`> stay out of my teritory
<Jmo> No Saturn, just no.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Mom worked at a UPS Store
<Stormy> but jobs are so competitive nowadays, I'm worried they'll look at that as a sign that I don't work well in groups or something =/
<Saturn> 08,01Jmo: why not?
<Jmo> That's just wrong.
<Saturn> 08,01there's nothing wrong with being paid for sex
<AssaultWithEmbraces> No nononononnononoooooooooo
<BladedWings> :D
<Jmo> In your mind.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I like not having an STD
<Lyra`> good girl
<Kimori> Will you be getting any kind of externship?
<Lyra`> thast why you only offfer service to those who look clean
<bicyclerepairman> having one ruins all the fun of getting one
<Saturn> 08,01well, some STDs have non outward sympotms
<Stormy> I had sort of an internship with this startup mobile app company
<Saturn> 08,01which is why you never have unprotected sex with a client
<Lyra`> besides i get tested once every 2 months
<Stormy> but due to some legal issues that didn't end up working out very well
<Kimori> legal?
<Alchemist> Saturn: it seems like you have a working business model. would you mind if i joined? :D
<Kimori> That involved you?
<Stormy> I guess some of the employees decided to basically steal the company from the owner
<Kimori> ???
<Stormy> I was not told anything about it
<Kimori> they fired you?
<Stormy> so one day I just stopped getting their messages
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: i could probably tell you more about the business than you ever wanted to know
<Stormy> pretty much
<Saturn> 08,01but not in here
<Kimori> ._.
<Stormy> I still don't really get what happened
<Lyra`> so Saturn, you have a business card?
<Kimori> Thats just fucked up
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: i have several
<Lyra`> well, im clean, youre clean, and im infertile
<sonicdude558> I see that Wrek it Ralph is streaming
<Lil_B> Ahhh, Alchemist Do you work in a GMP Laboratory?
<sonicdude558> c what I did there
<Stormy> emailed the owner a few months ago to try and find out why I was apparently fired and he told me all that
<Lyra`> lets talk.
<Saturn> 08,01i approve
<Scoot-Scootaloo> AHEMMM
<Lil_B> sonicdude558 awwww U
<Kimori> I don't exactly understand how employees can steal a company
<Jmo> Here's an idea, how about you move on from this shitty topic as children are around.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> What are you floozies talking about now~?
<Stormy> I don't either ._.
<Saturn> 08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: floozying for money
<Kimori> could ask SR about it
<Lyra`> Jmo, shush
<Alchemist> Lil_B: if you mean good manufacturing practice then no.
<Jmo> No.
<Stormy> that does sound like something he'd know about
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya everyone :)
<sonicdude558> I am very tired
<BladedWings> aaaaw but it was entertaining me Jaymoo~
<sonicdude558> and hungry
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I can see...
<Kimori> My only guess was that the employees had more stock than the owner
<Jmo> You wanna talk about this shit, take it to PM or another channel, honestly.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, i actually have to agree that we're getting a bit carried away here
<Rommulus> Hiya MLP_Brovakiin
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Ya think?
<Kimori> which gave them the power to do what they want with the company
<Lil_B> Alchemist sry, I ment GLP :P But I did work in a "GMP"- Laboratory once :/
<sonicdude558> soooooooooo whats going on right now guise?
<sonicdude558> Wrek it Ralph isn't streaming anything
<Stormy> ah, that would make sense
<Dark_Horst> he is streaming
<sonicdude558> yes
<The_TCR_Engineer> Hi everybody :(
<Lyra`> i stand by my original assessment of: Jmo, shush
<Dark_Horst> about to draw#
<Alchemist> Lil_B: well then i do :)
<Stormy> I'm not sure if they had stock though; it was a really small, informal kind of company
<Saturn> 08,01though, personally, i don't think it's a topic that should be off-limits for the ages we get in here
<BladedWings> hi The_TCR_Engineer whats up?
<Jmo> Lyra`, go away before I start saying shit about you.
<sonicdude558> but is he streaming anything? No. He is streaming a image.
<Saturn> 08,01but yeah, let's change subject
<Saturn> 08,01Jmo and Lyra`, both of you cool it please
<Saturn> 08,01enhance your collective calms
<Jmo> I am calm.
<BladedWings> So how bout dem ponies
<sonicdude558> keep calm
<Stormy> this is their website http://sniffitapp.com/
<Stormy> I worked on the business section of that
<sonicdude558> and _____ on.
<Alchemist> Lil_B: but I have to note that its only GLP on paper. If we did everything according to the rules we couldnt accomplish much.
<The_TCR_Engineer> Alright. BOTH OF YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP. Either talk about something instead of spamming the chat with your bullshitting
<Rommulus> He is streaming music
<The_TCR_Engineer> I hear someone eating chips..
<Lil_B> Alchemist good thing my school isn't... today I had to clean a lot of Glass-Stuff like Flasks for an Upcoming Analysis and When I was finished, the whole rooms had a slight HCl-Dust ...
<The_TCR_Engineer> WREK ARE YOU EATING CHIPS/
<BladedWings> wb Wrek
<Jmo> Oi.
<Rommulus> Oh hai dere
<Rommulus> How do you take your tea Wrek?
<otakon> okay the hell is going on in here?
<The_TCR_Engineer> I like tea with milk and sugar :3
<AssaultWithEmbraces> otakon, best leave it alone
<Alchemist> Lil_B: its a pain in the ass to be honest and it does more harm than good.
<Lyra`> let the hate flow through you, Jmo
<Wrek> 05earlt grey
<Wrek> 05hot
<Jmo> There is no hate.
<The_TCR_Engineer> Wow they are still fucking at it...
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`... i asked you to stop
<Lil_B> Alchemist yeah :/
<Kimori> ahh alright
<Lyra`> kay :3
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<Lyra`> ^-^
<Wrek> 05Saturn
<SpeccyRush> you forgot the tea at the beggining Wrek
<Wrek> 05on stream
<Wrek> 05you can see the 100% detail
<Lyra`> https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6878364416/hAC80487C/
<Lil_B> Wrek the Stitches look amazing
<The_TCR_Engineer> Goddammit world of warcraft why am I permanently banned and get refunded on my cash after buying the wow box and the addon ;.;
<Alchemist> Lil_B: we already have to wear foot bags all the time, we should store the gas canisters in a separate room all the time if the canister is not in use, a non certified person couldnt even enter the lab without supervision etc. Its too bureucratic.
<Wrek> 05how the hell do you manage to get banned on wow
<Wrek> 05:|
<The_TCR_Engineer> I DONT KNOW! I have a email saying they cant upgrade my shit
<sonicdude558> Wrek it Ralph... It has a nice ring to it
<The_TCR_Engineer> so thye banned me permanetly
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Say huh?
<Wrek> 05sounds like a scam mail
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Banned from who what now?
<Lil_B> Alchemist Footbags? Wow... I also think it's rediculus to recalibrate all the devices on every new day and Making new Solutions every day
<The_TCR_Engineer> SCAM EMAIL?
<Lil_B> Saturn You said you wanted to give me a Feedback on the Animation
<Barbetos|PonyMan> There is a lot of that stuff going on now, scam emails
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Was it WoW or D3 or soemthing?
<Saturn> 08,01The_TCR_Engineer: they don't generally refund you when they ban you
<The_TCR_Engineer> This notice is being sent to inform you that we are unable to successfully process the recently requested electronic upgrade for World of Warcraft account (my email). As such, this account has been set to the account type which it was at before the electronic upgrade and no charges have been processed for this.
<The_TCR_Engineer> ^^^
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Not sure. I really don't trust "blizzard" emails anymore
<The_TCR_Engineer> Also the next thing is
<The_TCR_Engineer> In addition, in order to protect the security of both this World of Warcraft account and your payment method we have disabled access to this account to prevent potential abuse.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> The last one I opened my account got hacked.
<otakon> oh look more stupid sexy Spitfire
<Barbetos|PonyMan> And I had not played wow in a good 3 years
<Wrek> 05you find this sexy?
<Wrek> 05creep!
<SpeccyRush> hah
<Alchemist> Lil_B: I thought recalibrating devices every time is not a requirement for GLP. at the academy all the devices are calibrated once maybe every 2 months, they get a certificate sticker with an expiration date on it so when there is an inspection they can see which instruments are not up to date, but every frickin time?? thats just stupid.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> llol
<The_TCR_Engineer> I have to contact blizzard..
<Barbetos|PonyMan> otakon: don't mind him. Spitfire is always stupid sexy.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> In her stupid sexy outfits.
<Wrek> 05also
<Wrek> 05this document is becomign veeeery big
<otakon> Barbetos|PonyMan: her
<Wrek> 05hard to edit the image xD
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dat Not Responding
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: you need moar ram
<otakon> Wrek: lol make it a smaller resolution then
*Saturn 08,01rams Wrek
<Wrek> 05nope
<Wrek> 05but SAI has a mem cap
<The_TCR_Engineer> Wrek what do you use to edit
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Wrek, how big is the image?
<Wrek> 05currently A2 at 300PPI
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Damn
<otakon> Wrek: you bugger you've drawn worse and you know it!
<Barbetos|PonyMan> I just love it when I go to remove a driver from a computer and it stays there
<ThunderBlaze> oh my god
<Barbetos|PonyMan> WINDOWS.
<ThunderBlaze> Spifore?
<Barbetos|PonyMan> BEST OS.
<ThunderBlaze> Spifire?
<ThunderBlaze> SPITFIRE
<otakon> Spitfire
<ThunderBlaze> JESUS
<Lil_B> Alchemist There was one analysis which I had to do about once a week, and everyxtime I had to recalibrate the Scales (if that's the correctb word) every time with mini-weights stored in a little chest xD
<otakon> lol what is wrong with you ThunderBlaze?
<otakon> brb
<ThunderBlaze> otakon: Just woke up apparently
*Bronysith glomps otakon
<The_TCR_Engineer> Bye everyone
<ThunderBlaze> Later Engineer
<The_TCR_Engineer> GMOD TIME! HAHAHAHA
<Alchemist> Lil_B: and the footbags are compulsory because the lab deals with biosensors and silicon wafers which are really sensitive to dust, but then why the hell do we have to pass an airlock to get into the lab?
<Bronysith> oi oi otakon , whats up?
<ThunderBlaze> Sooo... who's OC is that?
<Bronysith> im back to guild wars 2
<Lil_B> Alchemist yeah, it IS rather Nuts
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ThunderBlaze: That's Wrek's OC
<ThunderBlaze> He likes to paint and draw? neat?
<ThunderBlaze> Is that wrek doing the picture?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Yep.
<ThunderBlaze> Damn he's good
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You should see his stuff
<ThunderBlaze> I wish i could draw like that XD
<ThunderBlaze> DX
<ThunderBlaze> If only Spitfire kept her voice her original one i would be in love but it was a major turnoff for me
<ThunderBlaze> The new voice they gave her
<otakon> >turnoff
<Scoot-Scootaloo> You should listen to the Swedish Spitfire...
<ThunderBlaze> XD
<otakon> >pony
<ThunderBlaze> I actually like the Swedish Spitfire
<otakon> I SEE A PIE!
<Wrek> 05good
<otakon> she must be expecting Soarin
<Wrek> 05casue she's the oen who asked me draw this one ;)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> ^
<otakon> wait
<ThunderBlaze> @Wrek: Wut?
<otakon> THIS IS A COMMSSION FROM SWEDE SPITFIRE?!
<Wrek> 05not a comission
<Wrek> 05request
<otakon> well still nice
<ThunderBlaze> oh
<ThunderBlaze> neato
<ThunderBlaze> Don't know if you should trim the wings though... Well it's your art so you do whatever I still like it either way Wrek
<Barbetos|PonyMan> With a voice like that, how can you refuse?
<ThunderBlaze> So how long has Wrek been at it?
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Since the episode aired pretty much
<otakon> this pic alone?
<otakon> yesterday
<ThunderBlaze> yeah
<ThunderBlaze> my god
<otakon> about... 8 hours or so
<otakon> he's VERY detail oriented
<ThunderBlaze> DX WORK DAMMIT
<otakon> but we've seen him crank out good stuff in less than 3 hours
<Barbetos|PonyMan> spleeesh
<Wrek> 05the program cant handle all these pixels xD
<ThunderBlaze> Photoshop.exe is not working properly at the moment please try again.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Nope it can't
<ThunderBlaze> Would you like to report the error?
<ThunderBlaze> XD
<Alchemist> The new writer (Corey Powell) seems nice too. I'd love to hear an interview with her. http://derpy.me/6l6Yo
<AssaultWithEmbraces> SAI can't handle Wrek's skills
<ThunderBlaze> oh god
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Huh.. I usually get a middle finger when I get computer problems
<ThunderBlaze> if only all of the brony artists coud do that
<ThunderBlaze> ...
<ThunderBlaze> umm...
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ThunderBlaze, but then it would get stale. Every artist has their own art style
<Lil_B> Wait... did it crash?
<ThunderBlaze> Yep
*Lil_B was away for a few mins
<Wrek> 05its tryign to process
<MadSurge> Alchemist: first episode and it's an A+ right away! Impressive :$
<ThunderBlaze> oh ok
<Wrek> 05im not touchign it right now
<Wrek> 05its usign a gig of my ram
<Alchemist> not even PS can handle spitfire and Wrek's skills :D
<ThunderBlaze> @Wrek: It's nest not to do that not to touch it at all.
<otakon> dammit Wrek it's just too massive
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Wrek, please don't crash your computer.
<Lil_B> Yeah, I hope it didn't crash, destruction of hours of wroks because of a Crashing Programm is Probably the biggest "I don't wanna do this anymore" Faktor I have when making music :/
<ThunderBlaze> INFECTED MUSHROOM!
<ThunderBlaze> BUCK YES!
<BladedWings> That would suck, all that lost work
<ThunderBlaze> Love your taste of music
<ThunderBlaze> If you would ask me I am an EDM Pony
<ThunderBlaze> That's all i listen too
<ThunderBlaze> You say Lady gaga I saw Daft Punk
<ThunderBlaze> You say Slipknot I say Bloody Beetroots
<Alchemist> This is when I take a screwdriver out of the drawer and theatrically put it down on top of the PC case. that alone frightens my comp and starts working again properly.
<ThunderBlaze> Alchemist: XD!
<ThunderBlaze> I bet you guys that some r34 bronies have made this one scene...
<ThunderBlaze> I'm just saying
<ThunderBlaze> *Put's hooves up*
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ThunderBlaze, not the place to discuss that.
<BladedWings> agreed
<ThunderBlaze> AssaultWithEmbraces: Aren't we all adults here though?
<Lil_B> oh, it works again :)
<Alchemist> ThunderBlaze: my comp knows what its like to be getting "fixed" by me. It looks something like this: http://derpy.me/Rhpwp
<Saturn> 08,01ThunderBlaze: technically, no
<BladedWings> ThunderBlaze: you cant just assume that lol...and mentally, no :D
<Saturn> 08,01our age limit is 14
<killerpony7733> ThunderBlaze not everyone. Plus this is mean't to be children friendly so theres other channels for such things
<BladedWings> Alchemist: daaaw
<ThunderBlaze> 503 XD
<Phase4> Alchemist, thats what it looks like when i work on bronystate
<Alchemist> Phase4: seems to work though :D
<killerpony7733> So ThunderBlaze
<killerpony7733> If you want to talk about such things go to a 18+ channel
<ThunderBlaze> Sorry
<ThunderBlaze> I was just saying
<ThunderBlaze> I'm ending it here
<killerpony7733> ThunderBlaze Yeah and you should.
<ThunderBlaze> :/
<ThunderBlaze> *hides in corner*

<Barbetos|PonyMan> MadSurge: It did not for me either, untill I started to listen to the Silva Hound remix
<Wrek> 05atleast when the singing starts
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Which is in the style of Trap aparently.
<Alchemist> ThunderBlaze: I love john joseco's style :)
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Trap = rap, hip hop, and some other genre I can't think of.
<ThunderBlaze> I know same
*MadSurge doesn't listen to remixes on his own
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: The Legend of Cadence: Crystal Heart
<Scoot-Scootaloo> ... trap?
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Thats what it says
*Barbetos|PonyMan shrug
<Barbetos|PonyMan> It sounds gross to me. The name of the genre.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> But the song is still good.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> I guess.
<MadSurge> How are traps gross? O_o
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I'm digging these lyrics~
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Barbetos|PonyMan> The Lyrics start and then I get customer
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Sooo. I missed it.
<Alchemist> MadSurge: maybe I think i know what kind of traps he meant...
<Saturn> 08,01and then my exec profiler decided it was broken
<Alchemist> oh nvm
<Alchemist> never heard about trap as a musical genre...
<JRP2234|DooM> Saturn "An Excellent Planet"
<Alchemist> but then again there are more musical genres than songs tbh.
<Gold_Demona> dat paradoxical logic
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: i was sarcastic :D
<Gold_Demona> I'd like to see the genre that has no music in it. :D
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona silence music
<Gold_Demona> Sarcasm? What's that? How do you prepare it?
<Wrek> 05oo this is a nice song :D
<Gold_Demona> How dpes it taste?
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: well its called ambient :D
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona like... just an Album with a unwritten Disk in it...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: do you eat it?
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Looks like it is going to be one of those days. I start to think our internet went down, all the while this stream is running.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> I am smurt it
<Lil_B> or asn Album amde with LSD, so there will be no music, but you think there is mussic because you are hight Oo ... I stop now It has come low
<Lil_B> ok, I'm off for now, see you later
<Saturn> 08,01there are only two works of silent music i know of
<Gold_Demona> And they sound different? O_o
<Saturn> 08,01one is John Cage's 4'33, whihc is 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence
<Saturn> 08,01the other is Mike Batt's Minute Silence
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Songs like that make me wonder
<Saturn> 08,01interesting fact, the estate of John Cage has sued Mike Batt over Minute Silence, claiming he violated copyright by making a derivative work
<JRP2234|DooM> nintendo is what genisisent
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Sounds about right.
<Alchemist> modern art is confusing sometimes
<Saturn> 08,01well, it's not all that confusing
<Saturn> 08,01the whole point of 4'33 is that the ambient sound of where you are is the music
<Saturn> 08,01so it is, in effect, aleatoric
<Alchemist> Saturn: of course not all are confusing, but some are.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Johnny Cage sued someone? :O
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I always thought he was some kind of nut-puncher :/
<JRP2234|DooM> o fuck
<Alchemist> Saturn: tell me the meaning of an asian man painting a 2picture" of yellow horizontal stripes and screaming at the brush with each stroke.
<JRP2234|DooM> LOOK AT WHAT YOU PEOPLE
<JRP2234|DooM> IM DISGUSTED
<JRP2234|DooM> a angry birds movie
<JRP2234|DooM> you people did*
<Alchemist> JRP2234|DooM: to be honest, it doesnt even phase me :D
<Gold_Demona> It wasn't me. D:
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: is this an actual thing?
<Saturn> 08,01JRP2234|DooM: is *this* an actual thing?
<Alchemist> Saturn: it is
<JRP2234|DooM> Saturn yes
<JRP2234|DooM> Saturn 2016
<JRP2234|DooM> it was bound to happen
<Saturn> 08,012016? the fad will be over by then
<JRP2234|DooM> ikr
<JRP2234|DooM> idiot
<JRP2234|DooM> s
<Saturn> 08,01and it's just fucking angry birds... why do they need 3 years for development?
<Alchemist> Saturn: for the superb story I guess :D

<Gold_Demona> I can't do 3d stuffs :<

<Alchemist> bah humbug! I dont like christmas.
<Gold_Demona> Lots of Dubious/Unsavory stuff on there
<soulrider95> Gold_Demona: Yeah thats what I meant
<artist> I WANT PONY-SHIRTS DAMMIT
<soulrider95> Depends on your definiton of "unsavory"
<pony80007> Em

<Gold_Demona> You have awesome parents, Wrek. :D
<Saturn> 08,01unsavoury (n.) - any material that Saturn would giggle at
<Gold_Demona> LOL :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> xD
<artist> yes
<Gold_Demona> Yes, that
<Saturn> 08,01damnit, i meant a.
<Saturn> 08,01it's an adjective!
<soulrider95> but Saturn, you giggle at EVERYTHING
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I love how dumbasses always blame video games when people get shot up
*Saturn 08,01gigles
<Saturn> 08,01which is like a giggle, but spelled wrong
<Gold_Demona> I wonder what an unsavory looks like
<Saturn> 08,01Gold_Demona: a bit like a sweet, but bitterer
<soulrider95> Oh did anyone see the new THQ bundle on amazon?
<Barbetos|PonyMan> SI
<Wrek> 05fun fact
<Gold_Demona> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Nonono, this time they're blaming lax gun control laws.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Thanks to YOU
<Wrek> 05the gal that sang this was on LSD during it
<ThunderBlaze> Oh he's getting the wings now sweet
<ThunderBlaze> ... Damn they look soo soft
<ThunderBlaze> IWAT TO TOUCH THEM
<Gold_Demona> dem feathers :>
<soulrider95> Why can't I get a pony to snuggle :<
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: and the lack of God in schools.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> This one chump on tv thinks we can get rid of mass homicide by not getting our kids to play violent video games or see violent movies
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> HAHA
<artist> sexual ed edd n eddy
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Right....
<Barbetos|PonyMan> I hear there was a lot of blame put on Bioware this time around.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> For the shootings
<soulrider95> I probably would go on a killing spree if I couldn't relax with my violent media....
<Gold_Demona> What? Bioware? Seriously?
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Yeah
<Gold_Demona> How?
<Dark_Horst> hahahahwhat?
<soulrider95> Oh yeah, the older brother played Mass Effect, so logically it was biowares fault
<ThunderBlaze> Speaking of violence
<Alchemist> there always is. Lobbyists are prey on easily scared parents.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> THe guy who they thought did it had a like for Mass Effect on his facebook
<Dark_Horst> those dipshits again?=
<ThunderBlaze> Anyone here gonan play TF@?
<ThunderBlaze> TF2?
<Dark_Horst> "hurr durr, computer games make kikllers, derrrrp"
<Dark_Horst> seriosuly, i thought that fad was ovee
<Wrek> 052 of the largest school shootign in US history
<aniderp_work> anyone?
<Wrek> 05occured 3 years before pong was ever invented
<Barbetos|PonyMan> I wonder if they would ever blame pony.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Why do people think just because he played a damn game thats why he shot people up
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Who ever they are.
<Wrek> 05you cant blame video games
<otakon> it's bc he was mentally unbalanced
<otakon> not bc he played a video game
<Gold_Demona> And just the other day I shared a facebook post that said "If video games really influenced people, then the majority of Facebook users would be farmers."
<ThunderBlaze> Getting ready for raving here...
<ThunderBlaze> Waiting for drop
<soulrider95> When motion pictures were originally introduced, they had the same "they be bad" as video games have now....
<otakon> I play that game, you don't see me freaking shooting up schools do you?
<ThunderBlaze> Pulls out Glowsticks
<aniderp_work> Gold_Demona: lurking?
<otakon> I mean GOD I was in HS when Columbine went down
<Gold_Demona> aniderp_work: Kinda
<otakon> I made mention of it talking to a friend
<ThunderBlaze> I just finished college when that occured
<otakon> I got pulled out of school for psych evaluation
<aniderp_work> can i have hugs?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I play plenty of violent video games
<otakon> aniderp_work: yes
*otakon hugs aniderp_work
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I don't feel like shooting people up
<soulrider95> Lol I have to get a psych eval next week
*Alchemist hugs aniderp_work
<aniderp_work> idk if i can have my laptop tonight ;_;
<ThunderBlaze> HUG ALL OF THE PEOPLE
<Dark_Horst> i'm pretty sure we all know that video games are the last thing that are even remotely to blame
*Gold_Demona hugs aniderp_work :3
<ThunderBlaze> Wrek what group is this?
*soulrider95 huggles everyone
<Alchemist> I've never had to go on a psych eval despite working with dangerous stuff most of the time...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Soccer moms just need a scapegoat to blame
<ThunderBlaze> @Wrek: What group is this?
<artist> fisting cows! yes
<Alchemist> wat
<artist> mrcreepypasta reads about fisting cows
<Dark_Horst> " he played counterstrike. therefore, counterstrike amde him murder people" by that logic we cant eat bread anymore. i'm sure the columbine shooters ate bread. bread makes killers
<ThunderBlaze> We must Destroy all of the bread
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> breathing makes you kill people
<soulrider95> Breathing makes killers bro, everyone is killer
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> THINKING makes you kill people
<Dark_Horst> or hey, they went bowling before the shooting, right? bowling makes killers too
<artist> i've heard they even wore clothes
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I also love how they blame guns for killing people
<ThunderBlaze> Well im off to play Tf2 if anyone want's to join
<Dark_Horst> OH FUCK!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Not the people who fired the guns
<Dark_Horst> I WEAR CLOTHES!
<Gold_Demona> Did you know that 100% of people who drink water die? It's true. >.>
<Alchemist> yeah, its like saying that hitler and stalin had mustaches so beware of people with mustaches
<Dark_Horst> i'm dangerous!!!!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> GUNS ARE BUILT FOR KILLING DUMBASSES
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> OF COURSE THEY KILL PEOPLE
<ThunderBlaze> Al right later
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Coworker trying to make sure his phone is working, recieving texts and what not. I send him pics of pony.
<Barbetos|PonyMan> =D
<Kandarihu> You know what? The further we get away from filing Minority Reports on entire populations, the better.
<Gold_Demona> To quote Larry the Cable Guy: "If we can blame guns for killing people, then I can blame misspelled words on my pencil."
<Dark_Horst> actually, guns dont kill people
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, good quote
<Dark_Horst> people kill people
<artist> i kill people
<artist> with guns
<artist> aw yeah
<Alchemist> more accurately people with guns kill people :D
<Dark_Horst> they just as may use a toaster to crack your skull. whatcha gonna say then? toasters kill people?
<artist> jon lajoie
<soulrider95> toasters are dangerous shit Dark_Horst, dont joke like that
<Gold_Demona> The only thing I'll agree with is that a gun's purpose is to kill people, but it is only a tool. Ultimately it's the person wielding it who decides how to use it.
<Dark_Horst> i once battled a sandwich to the death
<Dark_Horst> ducker almost got me
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Goldframe: Alot of people fail to see that
<Dark_Horst> *fucker
<aniderp_work> the brave little toaster?
<Gold_Demona> We also hear about people stabbing people all the time, but we don't hear anyone demanding that we regular knives.
<Gold_Demona> regulate even
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: thats because it takes effort for someone to kill 70 people with a meat cleaver than with a rifle6handgun.
<Gold_Demona> True
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: you think killing peop,e with a gun takes no effort?
<Dark_Horst> you obvipously never fired a gun
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Dark_Horst: Spray and pray
<soulrider95> It takes LESS effort than a cleaver
<Gold_Demona> Depends on the gun.
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: no, no, I say its EASIER to kill more people in less time than with a shiv.
<Kandarihu> I've heard from people in the U.K. "We haven't had a gun incident like this for decades, because we banned all guns." Well I'd like to ask these Brits what homocidal maniacs use to kill innocent people.
<aniderp_work> can i be held?
<aniderp_work> oh i got a muffin today
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: Im sure handling a gun takes some skill and effort, but come on. a gun vs a knife?
<Gold_Demona> This song again. =D
<aniderp_work> Gold_Demona: guess what muffin i got
<Gold_Demona> aniderp_work: booberry? :>
<aniderp_work> yes!
<Alchemist> boob?
<Gold_Demona> :D
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: we use knives
<Saturn> 08,01er
<Saturn> 08,01they use knives.
<aniderp_work> derpy lovers her muffins
<Saturn> 08,01or explosives
<Saturn> 08,01or black market guns
<aniderp_work> mostly booberry :P
<Gold_Demona> I like muffins. :>
<Saturn> 08,01or legal guns, like hunting rifles
<Kandarihu> See? Bad guys use whatever they can get their hands on. They don't need guns if they want to kill a lot of innocent people.
<Gold_Demona> I want a muffin irl now. :<
*aniderp_work gives muffin
<Gold_Demona> :D
<aniderp_work> i didnt eat it yet
<aniderp_work> im saving it for later
<Saturn> 08,01guns don't kill people, bullets do
<Alchemist> I dont know what is a booberry muffin but it sounds delicious :D
<Gold_Demona> Yeah! Let's ban all bullets!
<Saturn> 08,01i know because i saw a documentary on BBC 2
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also I ask how will not letting our kids play violent video games or see violent movies get rid of mass homicide?
<the_real_pony_1604> watching Wrek construct the wing makes me wonder…. on a pony where does the hair stop and the feathers start is the wing all feathers or is it a mix?
<aniderp_work> you know what?
<Gold_Demona> Although technically, Saturn, you could bludgeon someone to death with a gun.
<aniderp_work> aniderp for president!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You could possible kill anyone with ANYTHING
<aniderp_work> free muffins for everyone!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> BAN EVERYTHING
<aniderp_work> and sea ponies
<Gold_Demona> Yey :D
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Hell I bet you could beat someone to death with a Rubix Cube
<aniderp_work> Gold_Demona: dont forget your vice
<Kandarihu> In 2007, some lunatic attempted a massacre in Akihabara, Japan. He started his massacre with a big Semi truck. And when he could no longer kill people, he got out and drew a dagger. He stabbed as many people as he could with that.
<Gold_Demona> Nobody's allowed to have anything ever again ever because everything's dangerous!
<aniderp_work> can i have derpy m\plushies?
<Alchemist> okay lets make a list of ridiculous objects to kill a person with
<aniderp_work> banana
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Alchemist: Rubix Cube
<artist> Kandarihu: a derp killer?
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: Banana peels
<Scoot-Scootaloo> This is starting to sound like Black Ops 2 music...
<aniderp_work> um
<aniderp_work> oranges
<Dark92Enigma> WHY So many people are leaving the fandom?
<Barbetos|PonyMan> What?
<Alchemist> Dark92Enigma: they do? :D
<Alchemist> good for them
<aniderp_work> forks are dangerous
*Dark92Enigma just saw leaving the fandom 101
<Barbetos|PonyMan> Dark92Enigma: Probably becuase of R34
<Dark92Enigma> that's why
<Gold_Demona> So are spoons. They hurt more
<Dark92Enigma> oh
<artist> Dark92Enigma: oh god why?!
<Saturn> 08,01r34?
<aniderp_work> the person next to me is watching ponies///
<Kandarihu> artist, I think he killed about 17 people in total. But we shouldn't be ranking people like that as more kills = better, though.
<Saturn> 08,01r34 has always been there
<Saturn> 08,01don't blame it on porn
<killerpony7733> ^
<Gold_Demona> r34 has been around forever and people are only NOW leaving the fandom? O_o
<Gold_Demona> That's like blaming killing on guns
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Stubborn as Ponies
<Alchemist> a 3 year reaction time is slow even by my standards
<aniderp_work> guys ;_;
<artist> Kandarihu: hmmm, i don't rank people that kill, i just say yay less population!
<aniderp_work> i gotta go :<
<Gold_Demona> bye aniderp_work :<
<artist> aniderp_work: you have to work

<Alchemist> bye aniderp_work! Hang in there!
<aniderp_work> ill try not to explode tonight
<aniderp_work> maybe i get it back tonight!

<Kurra> Don't you have a team medic? Ask them no? Maybe you injured a nerve, which maybe is why you can't move it?
<Gold_Demona> Socks: I agree, but it has no other name. :P
<_Dark_Moon_> It happens all the time

<tigher1001> Wrek: i suck at programs like that so im just going to pretend i know wat u takin about k :)
<the_real_pony_1604> week, can you build things like the wing, outfit, ext in another project and then nest the project into this one? that would reduce the layer level greatly
<the_real_pony_1604> week = wrek
<SpeccyRush> how many layers ya got left Wrek ?
<_Dark_Moon_> I think he's nearly out of them
<artist> PIE!

<_Dark_Moon_> oh boy what flavour :O
<Wrek> 05i know that the_real_pony_1604, but i dotn want to merge thigns i might want to edit later
<tigher1001> PIE FLAVOR:|
<_Dark_Moon_> *guitar solo*
<the_real_pony_1604> you should be able to open the project and still edit it. granted it might be a little strange feeling.
<tigher1001> MAN.... i missed my x-mas part caus im sick
<tigher1001> cause*
<RainbowAsh> Wrek: Can't you save some layers as a separate project before you merge them in the main one? Later on, you can edit them in the new project and replace the old merged layer in the main one.

<Alchemist> oooh, metro 2033
<Serenity> Wrek: Replaced the Baestuhd guhn already?
<Miss_Rarity> hmmmnn...
<sonicdude558> The engine features volumetric fog, double PhysX precision, object blur, sub-surface scattering for skin shaders, parallax mapping on all surfaces and greater geometric detail with a less aggressive LOD(s).
<Miss_Rarity> laffy taffy tastes like crap
<soulrider951> this engine is beast
<Hoody|Skool_> Wrek shoot something
<Kandarihu> sonicdude558, but is the game fun?
*sonicdude558 is confused
<soulrider951> It is a fun game

<soulrider95> IN THIS GAME, military grade ammo is used as currency
<YokusaHHart> I'm guessing Ammo is currency?

<ThunderBlaze> ITS A TRAP
<Dark_Horst> doestn seem to be much ammo in the future

<Sugar_Flanks> Bye Snow
<Sumica> 00,10remember use fire, tey can still recover some data if you ues magnets
<Lil_B> cya Snow
*Snow has stopped falling in bronystate
<Kipkat07_Scarf> because Im near positive I have a fuckin virus. I never got my antivirus updated
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dat livstid i krig :3
<Chrysalis> Sumica or just use a free-ware data removal tool
<Sugar_Flanks> Can you system restore it to before you think you had a virus?
<Sumica> 00,10takes too long
<Chrysalis> that way you keep the drive
<Chrysalis> Sugar_Flanks if you kept backups
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back :3
<Sumica> 00,10they can abbort the data wipe
<Chrysalis> heres a hint
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I could use system restore but I dont want to have to reinstall Linux and all my steam games
<Chrysalis> dont keep crap like that on a pc
<Sugar_Flanks> Kipkat07_Scarf: Gotcha
<Dark_Horst> wanna destroy data? smash hdd with a sledgehammer, burn the rest, dump in river
<Kipkat07_Scarf> and my mom would fucking kill me
<Chrysalis> Kipkat07_Scarf you dont need to
<Dark_Horst> only way to be sure
<Chrysalis> steam is portable
<Kandarihu> Kipkat07_Scarf, so it's just a virus and not an FBI raid?
<Sumica> 00,10oh I thought we were talking about a panic button
<Sumica> 00,10not just simple virus removal
<Dark_Horst> i have no idea what we're talking about
<Chrysalis> yo momma
<Dark_Horst> i just read about magnets and thats the first thing i though of^^
<Kandarihu> Wrek, I was waiting for someone to start streaming Big Picture.
<Kandarihu> So thank you
<Chrysalis> Kandarihu its just an interface
<Kandarihu> Chrysalis, but it's a nice front-end.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I have done desperation HDD wipes before. I once destroyed my entire Windows account because my uncle was coming over and was going to stumble upon my pony folder
<Chrysalis> so?
<Sumica> 00,10big picture would not show up on stream
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: why were you waiting? it was in a steam update
<Dark_Horst> everyone got it
<Chrysalis> front ends dont do anything
<Anger> anyone else have a black screen?
<soulrider95> Yeah....
<Lil_B> I've heard a nice Story about somone who doenloaded Movies and just sold them for a few Bucks on DVD, and the day the Police came to his House, he Slipped a Slim Sheed of Metal out of his PC, which caused a small amount of higly concentrated Acid to ruin his HD enough to not proof his Guild xD
<Dark_Horst> Kipkat07_Scarf: that i'd call paranoid
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm, I see only darkness
<Chrysalis> Kipkat07_Scarf how bout oh i dont know
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Dark_Horst: it was
<Chrysalis> a password
<soulrider95> Wrek: it isnt capturing the game
<Chrysalis> or an encrypted folder
<Chrysalis> you know, something easy
<Sumica> 00,10wrek, geting sound only
<TrixieMuffin> Lets play radio
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Chrysalis: I tried to encrypt my folder and passlock it but my version of windows wont let me >_<
<Sumica> 00,10dxcap is not locked on to game any more
<Lil_B> and yeah, normal Full Disk Swipes that don't just remove the Pointers, but really just 0's everything is enough for modern drives, the... whatever methof it was that requered 32 wipes is redundend
<Chrysalis> Kipkat07_Scarf thats what external programs are fore
<Sumica> 00,10yeah if you have write to zero programs
<soulrider95> I dont think wrek can see/hear us
<Sumica> 00,10it works jsut fine
<Chrysalis> Lil_B you can get programs which overwrite it with random bits several times
<Chrysalis> clears all the magnetic memory
<jcelios> Kipkat07_Scarf: try something like TrueCrypt?
<Chrysalis> though its a bad idea usually
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Chrysalis: I tried looking but I couldn t find free ones
<Chrysalis> generally recovery is only ever a good thing
<Chrysalis> if you have stuff you want hidden that badly
<Chrysalis> don't have it
<Lil_B> Chrysalis yeah, there are a lot that can do it, I'd probably use CCleaner because I know that they don't have any hidden Spyware or other unneccesary Stuff in there
<Chrysalis> or store it remotely
<TrixieMuffin> Become a Bronystate Goldmember today , never get capturedrops again!
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmmm, it's dooing it again
<soulrider95> I didn't know this game would be so finnicky :<
<Chrysalis> TrixieMuffin shhhh your not supposed to tell people about gold
<Sumica> 00,10you could force a windoeed mode wrek
*thelonepony sneaks into chat >.>
<Chrysalis> only ever silver
<Kipkat07_Scarf> my ex-cop asshole said he was going to quote: "put spyware on my computer so he could see what Im doing". A.) spyware doesnt always do that B.) Thats fuckin illegal

<Kipkat07_Scarf> wat do
<jelonheoh> oh crap, i forgot about my doom 2 playthrough. hmm...to record or not to record?
<dashoftherainbow> that is the question at hand
<Stallion_of_War> There are already giant sewer wererats... I don't see how this could get too much worse.
<Dark_Horst> Kipkat07_Scarf: make sure you're logged in with administrator rights
<jelonheoh> this game reminds me of fallout
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Im on the only accont
<Kipkat07_Scarf> *account
<Kipkat07_Scarf> its already admin
<soulrider95> DUN DUN DU NNNNNNNNN
<Kazur> its like the mix of fallout/fear/doom
<Dark_Horst> noppüe
<Dark_Horst> not fallout
<Kazur> you know
<Dark_Horst> fallout would require it to be open world
<Kazur> radiation and stuff
<Kazur> mutants
<jelonheoh> i mean the style of the weapons reminds me of fallout
<Sumica> 00,10pump action flash light
<Dark_Horst> stalker had all that too
<dashoftherainbow> fear scared the living :P out of me the first time
<Dark_Horst> and nothing to do with fallout
<Stallion_of_War> The gun is HAUNTED!!!!
<Triple> hey folks
<dashoftherainbow> hi triple
<Triple> what is this :>?
<Dark_Horst> drugs
<Kazur> Metro 2033
<Dark_Horst> metro 2033
<Triple> oh
<Triple> dark_horst claims the name is drugs lol
<Sumica> 00,10fear was not that good a game for me. my sound channles were backwards
<dashoftherainbow> name of it? no it is drugs :3
*Stallion_of_War BREATHING LOUDLY
<Sumica> 00,10I never looked the right way when I heard sounds
<Dark_Horst> Stallion_of_War: go and try breathe in a gas mask
<Triple> its never turn the right way after hearing sounds
<Triple> :>
<Kazur> those damn sever wolf thingies
<Kazur> roaring all the time
<dashoftherainbow> BRB
<Triple> wait i meant to say
<Triple> its never the right thing to turn the way you hear the creepy sounds
<Stallion_of_War> Solution: Use a gun; and if that doesn't work, use more gun
<Kazur> nope.avi
<Triple> and if thats doesnt work ... run
<jelonheoh> what if run doesnt work either?
<Kazur> and if that doesnt work ... SPY SAPPIN MAH STUFF
<Triple> here is your answer
<Dark_Horst> more gun always works
<Kazur> but then
<Kazur> suddently
<Kazur> UBERCHARGE MOTHERFUCKER
<Kazur> only solution for ubered demo is running
<Dark_Horst> that vuy laughs like me
<Dark_Horst> *guy
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I need to get new headsets :'( my left ear sound doesnt work
<Dark_Horst> i'm really starting to liek the setting odf this
<Dark_Horst> if onyl the sound mastering woudnt be so fucking horrible
<soulrider95> This is one of the most atmospheric games I've played
<Dark_Horst> revolver rifle?
<Dark_Horst> thes epeople seem to really like revolvers
<Kazur> i think the shop guy is heavy from tf2
<soulrider95> FER BAYBEYZ
<Kazur> every sentence ends with babies
<Kazur> is russian
<Kazur> has awesome guns
<Kazur> but he is not fat :<
<Kazur> heavy*
<Kazur> i dont want to be offensive :3
<Dark_Horst> conversations have WAY too much range
<soulrider95> well they are in a dark cramped tunnel
<Dark_Horst> you hear folks who are like at the other end of the damn station
<soulrider95> what do you expect....
<Dark_Horst> soulrider95: irl you'd have to scream to be that audible
<soulrider95> and they are russian, they talk loud :<
<Dark_Horst> it was especially noticable at the first station
<Dark_Horst> cramped or not, you dont hear people through three walls
<dashoftherainbow> im back :P
<soulrider95> Lets not argue the realism of a game with mutants :3
<jcelios> I think it might be a bug, I don't remember it being like that in other playthroughsI've seen
<dashoftherainbow> careful? wat
<jcelios> but yeah this game is great :)
<Dark_Horst> seems linear thoug so far
<Dark_Horst> hope that changes
<jcelios> well its suppose to be linear
<Kazur> sorry to be mean but.... his AK sucks
<pony_995> whats this game called
<dashoftherainbow> jcelios: i never seen, played, even heard of this game :3
<soulrider95> Metro 2033
<jcelios> its Metro 2033
<pony_995> thanks
<jcelios> its trying to tell a story, not create a sandbox
<Dark_Horst> or not
<jcelios> it's got that distinct russian bleakness unique to classic russian literature
<soulrider95> the game is based on a russian book of the same name
<jcelios> ah that makes sense!
<jcelios> lol
<Dark_Horst> see? that's why linear elvel design sucks
<jcelios> :I
<Kazur> oh mai gawd this gaim is laik K.O.D and it suck
<dashoftherainbow> :l
<soulrider95> Not every game can be open world :<
<jcelios> I don't think linear vs non-linear game design is as simple as one sucks and the other doesn't :I
<soulrider95> This one is more about telling a story of human survival in a wasteland, and creating that atmostphere.
<Dark_Horst> he problem is that this is extreemely linear
<Dark_Horst> games CAN be linear if they give you certianf reedoms
<soulrider95> its not THAT linear.....
<Dark_Horst> like human revolutio
<Dark_Horst> n
<soulrider95> I've played much more linear games
<Barbetos|PonyMan> AHHHHHHHHH
<dashoftherainbow> god im tired... ill be back, later
<Dark_Horst> it didnt let him jumpo a gap that would have been in jumping range
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye dashoftherainbow
<Dark_Horst> that is a flaw in level design
<Dark_Horst> wanted or not
<soulrider95> yes, but if it was TOO free, then how would they tell the story?
<jcelios> possibily, that doens't only happen in linear design though
<Kazur> well
<Dark_Horst> soulrider95: ask fallout. or skyrim. they manage
<soulrider95> Dont get me started on bethesda games
<Dark_Horst> soulrider95: or deus ex human revolution
<soulrider95> Skryim is the most boring PoS game I've played in a while
<Bronysith> skyrims story is abouta s generic as it can get
<jcelios> invisible walls and unjumpable gaps etc. there a symtom of a broader problem in game design
<Kazur> "sandbox" like Far Cry 3 does not let you go to the second island until yo do all the missions
<thelonepony> soulrider95: well, play the Morrowind or Oblivion then
<soulrider95> Skyrim is just bland
<Dark_Horst> soulrider95: pos?
<soulrider95> oblivion has the same problem
<Bronysith> piece of shit Dark_Horst
<soulrider95> morrowind is horrible antiquated
<jcelios> Pony on Stream
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/i2J4Q.jpg
<Dark_Horst> you people have obviously no idea about games
<Bronysith> fallout is just a better overall series than elder scrolls
<soulrider95> Wrek: you need to change your filter
<Bronysith> but skyrim is still good
<Dark_Horst> fallout is elder scrolls with guns
<Dark_Horst> it's exactly the same. they even use the same engine
<Bronysith> well considering fallout came before elder scrolls, you are wrong
<Kazur> they should add an option to this game as a DLC that would let you turn off the breathing noise
<soulrider95> oh and the gamebryo engine that bethseda uses is just horrible
<Dark_Horst> appearantly you have never touched falliut 3 or new vegas
<soulrider95> WREK YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR MASK FILTER
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: im talking about the originals
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: we're not
<Kazur> dem QTEs
<jcelios> pretty hard to talk about the fallout series as a whole in terms of game design specifics considering the difference between the first and second vs the third etc.
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: well when you say fallout, you are referencing fallout 1
<soulrider95> FO2 is best fallout
<Bronysith> say fallout 3 or new veags
<Bronysith> new vegas is far surperior to fallout 3
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: nope
<soulrider95> because new vegas was written by obsidian
<Kazur> i love fallout 3 mostly because of Galaxy News Radio
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: it has different strengths
<Dark_Horst> its bnot superior
<Bronysith> it has better gameplay
<soulrider95> The writing is better in new vegas
<Dark_Horst> new vegas has better gameplay elements, fallout 3 managed to capture the athmosphere way better
<Bronysith> yes
<Bronysith> but i came to play a game
<Kazur> the story is better in NV but radio is WAY better in 3
<Bronysith> not stare at a picture
<Dark_Horst> that doesnt make it surerior by default
<Dark_Horst> athmosphere is vital to every game
<jcelios> pacman?
<soulrider95> tetris?
<Bronysith> not as important as the actual FUCKING GAMEPLAY
<jcelios> yeah but batman could totally beat superman in a fight
<Dark_Horst> and ther i though we were talking about the last two centuries
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sleepies tiem is over \:D/
<Kazur> 3 and NV have bassicly the same gameplay
<thelonepony> SuperBrony64: Yay :D
<Kazur> but 3 has THREEEE DAWWWGGGG
*thelonepony gives SuperBrony64 a cookie :3
<Kazur> thats why it wins
<Sumica> 00,10Superlazy64
<jcelios> I'm serious, batman carries a sample of kyptonite around with him
*SuperBrony64 noms on the cookie :3c
<jcelios> he's ALWAYS prepared
<jcelios> and would totally win
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I not lazy ;3;
<Laksen> what are you guys doing ? :)
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: then again the tiny gameplay improvements new vegas had werent by far enough to outweigh the half assed western setting they used for it
<Afflict> haha
<Kazur> watching other guys play Breathing Simulator 2012
<jcelios> arguing which superhero could beat which in a fight (aka which videogames are "Better" then each other)
<Laksen> nice :)
<Dark_Horst> when i played vegas, i didnt quite feel like playing fallout. that's what 3 did way better
<alexxm> so is like STALKER
<Kazur> wasting ammo like a BAWS
<soulrider95> STALKER is like this game but almost completely open world
<Kazur> 5/6 bullets in the air
<soulrider95> however the story isnt good
<soulrider95> *isnt as good
<jcelios> you are so screwed lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm on hold with the Apple Store to see if they have Apple Pies in stock O3O
<Dark_Horst> i didnt know radiation can gut you like that
<Kazur> water op
<jcelios> mmmmm I <3 Apple Pie
<SuperBrony64> 11,02...three calls ahead of me...people must like their apple pies as well...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This is what happens when you give Applejack all your business
<aji> meep
<SuperBrony64> 11,02jcelios: i liek dem too :3c
<thelonepony> wow

<Kazur> well nope
<Dark_Horst> it'S hard
<jcelios> SuperBrony64: huh, what about 'merika?
<thelonepony> Kipkat07_Scarf: what did it say?
<Sumica> 00,10so gasmask are just for looks then eh?
<Sumica> 00,10not replacing the filter just makes it anoying
<Dark_Horst> withoutn the gas mask, the surface air kills him

<thelonepony> Michael: More like idiots that cant Controll their own children :I
<Mike> Michael: I got to play my first M rated games wheen I was ten. I was a very mature child, so it's really subjective.
<Michael> thelonepony: yeah, that's also true :(
<Michael> Mike: yeah, but there always excemptions, like you
<Mike> Chrysalis: Ever had homemade strawberry shortcake?
<soulrider95> My parents didnt let me play M rated games till I wrote a 2 page paper on the difference between games and real life
<Chrysalis> Mike yup
<thelonepony> I need to play something, but which game should i play? ;_;
<Chrysalis> im quite a good baker
<Mike> soulrider95: A+ for parenting

<Mike> I personally prefer immersive games with a plot. Plot better than 'here are terrorists. Kill them.' I like fantasy, RPG, RTS, roguelikes, and more.
<thelonepony> Michael: I have Bad Company
<Michael> darn
<Mike> Although BattleField 3 is immersive enough and realistic enough for me to forgive the cliche plot.
<jcelios> is it weird that I have trouble keeping track of my own age +/- 1.5 years?
<thelonepony> nope

<jcelios> Alchemist: one of the background artists had her sit like a human on a bench, in the fandom this evolved into the idea of her wanting to be human
<CountDoofus> Eeryup, episode Dragonshy
<MadSurge> Wrek missed some gems :(
<Alchemist> jcelios: oh, I thought it had different roots than the sitting on the bench :D

<Michael> Gnight everypony :)
<MadSurge> LunarSpectrum: when he changes the world graphics

<MadSurge> Sumica: yep, because it loops
<Bronysith> especially when you set your enemies on fire
<salty365> it ok to rage quit (especially this game)
<Sumica> 00,10I would have guessd clear the path then shift the mode

<StinkomanFan> 8 in total, and you'll have to play the game yourself i you REALLY want to know
<MadSurge> LunarSpectrum: modes?
<LunarSpectrum> MadSurge: the differences in graphics
<TheMaster> things get happier and happier
<MadSurge> LunarSpectrum: some stuff gets solid or dangerous in different modes
<StinkomanFan> God, my eyes.
<TrixieMuffins> Happyest mode , all plants are grown and block your path and you can walk on clouds , the darker it gets the more plants wither and enemys get first depressed , then monstrous
<StinkomanFan> Even Pinkie Pie'd think this is too much
<LunarSpectrum> oh..ok..

<thelonepony> Bronysith: gonna do something nauughty~?
<Kjakings> 7You fail at following a linguistic lead, Stormbles. This could've been an awesome night of impromptu victorian english, but no, you had to go and be an uncouth colonial.

<salty365> Phase4 awsome comic
<salty365> GOTY
<DJEasyGryphon> Gotta love Half life
<LunarSpectrum> course
<LunarSpectrum> and the portal series
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Fallout with 1 intelligence 10 strenght
<DJEasyGryphon> XD
<Kjakings> 7I don't know I'm really sleep-deprived recently that tends to make me a smidge more unhinged.
<LunarSpectrum> do portal
<salty365> valve has done great things
<DJEasyGryphon> In the original, if you have low intelligence, you could only grunt
<DJEasyGryphon> Doom is awesome as well
<Kjakings> 7Or at the very least, stops me censoring my thoughts so much so a more full extent of how unhinged I really am is revealed to the world, in its rainbow-speckled glory.
<LunarSpectrum> never played the doom series
<StinkomanFan> FALLOUT
<LunarSpectrum> they looked...kinda boring
<Kjakings> 7... Not that you would want it rainbow /speckled/
<Kjakings> 7I don't think I meant speckled.
<DJEasyGryphon> They can get pretty intense
*Stormy slaps Kjakings with a 4r8a9i11n13b17o26w trout
<DJEasyGryphon> Killing floor is awesome
<salty365> is dat windows XP
<LunarSpectrum> ZED gun is neat
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/g0vvD.gif
<Wrek> 05its actualyl win7
<Kjakings> 7fuck yes
<DJEasyGryphon> OMG original doom!, I have floppy disks of it!!
<Kjakings> 7This episode was amazing
<Wrek> 05but having the basic theme makes everythign faster and stereaming easier
<Kjakings> 7(although Dash and Dust were clearly fucking the entire time)
<salty365> ahhh
<DJEasyGryphon> Very true!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I liked it, I dont know why so many people hated it.
<Stormy> interesting interpretation there
<LunarSpectrum> ha
<Stormy> People hated it?
<Stormy> I thought this was one of the fan favorites
<DJEasyGryphon> I love this game...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> well i saw a lot of negative comments towards it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> a lot more than positie.
<DJEasyGryphon> I also love how bronystate isn't blocked at my school :P
<Stormy> hm
<salty365> confound these darn adds
<Stormy> I really liked it
<Kjakings> 7I ship all the ponies.
<LunarSpectrum> ha, the guy that did the blocking is a brony :P
<Stormy> got slightly annoyed at Rainbow Dash for not admitting to any of the wrongdoing herself and blaming it all on that other girl
<Kjakings> 7I mean Dash is clearly besotted with Twi, but that doesn't mean she's not going to take what was clearly an opportunity on a silver platter for some very athletic sex.
<Stormy> But it is a kids' show...
<LunarSpectrum> ...they are transluscent?
<Stormy> wat
<DJEasyGryphon> Who?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/gFCOE.jpg
<salty365> gotta love the classics
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<DJEasyGryphon> I haven't seen someone play this well before O_O
<Serenity> and so, we are DOOMed to meet
<Chrysalis> Serenity that was bad
<Chrysalis> and you should feel bad
<DJEasyGryphon> :D
<DJEasyGryphon> Aww, be nice
<DJEasyGryphon> :'(
<LunarSpectrum> Fluttershy is impossible to be hated when she cries
<Kjakings> 7... I think in my head I stopped thinking of them as ponies and simply started thinking of them as characters a long time ago, which makes it a lot easier to ship them without feeling weird.
<Wrek> 05look ma! no strafing
<EggNog5000> Hey guys!
<Serenity> Look bastard, no miniguns! (In my terms, that's an extremely good feat)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> best gif http://i.imgur.com/4mMAV.gif

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: PMV: Mad Mares / The Beat / Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo - Too Late
<Buytoast> Man, Halo looks terrible at these settings
<Chrysalis> no strafing run?
<Serenity> Buytoast: Well, Halo is 2001.
<Chrysalis> now THAT is badass
<Serenity> When you thing the big-arse jumpup in hardware from 01-03 because of Xbox and Gamecube
<Kjakings> 7 anyway
<jcelios> y no strafing :>
<jcelios> :<
<Serenity> Wrek: Are you playing Suicidal difficukty?

<Chrysalis> Serenity yup
<jcelios> o gawd...
<Chrysalis> i enjoyed it
<Shizuka> doom film was okay
<Shizuka> like as okay as can be
<Serenity> It wasn't bad, considering how much a lot of Game Films ruin it
<Serenity> Anyway, nighty night. everypony
<Chrysalis> doom, where bullets are 15ft tall
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Serenity :)
<Chrysalis> so who needs to look up/down
<Serenity> Quake 1 is IMPOSSIBLE without strafe
<Shizuka> nah more like the level is just 2d, the hitscan doesn't take height into account
<Shizuka> hey
<Shizuka> hey
<Shizuka> you know what wrek needs :3
<Shizuka> YEEELLOOW CAAAAAAAAARD

<Buytoast> "We wanted to make a Legend of Zelda movie the fans would really enjoy! But the rest of the audience was bored, so we made Link talk too!"

<MadSurge> Shizuka: RIP AND TEAR
<Shizuka> san andreas retextured, something like that
<jcelios> Sumica: but you could ride peddle bikes up mountains!
<Sumica> 00,10oh they have a grafic mod?
<alexxm|colt> so where any of the san andreas urban legends true
<jcelios> which
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I have to wade through like 40 pages of crap to find one good pic.
<Shizuka> i think there's something to hook shaders in but there is a texture pack ja
<Shizuka> trying to find the name
<Kjakings> 7welcome to the internet?
<Sumica> 00,10cause yeah CJ is scarry looken
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and 30% of the pictures are censored due to "questionable" material.
<jcelios> alexxm|colt: the two that come to mind are the ghost car and flying to liberty city, both are kinda true, thought the liberty city area is above the hight limit on planes and its a small area
<Shizuka> san andreas retextured 3
<Wrek> 05yay
<Wrek> 05took me long enough :|
<MadSurge> Yaaaaay!
<Shizuka> what wad is this wrek?
<Wrek> 05first of the master levels
<Kjakings> 7... I'm sorry but 30% is a pretty good percentage.
<Shizuka> ohhhhhhhh
<Wrek> 05on ultraviolence
<Kjakings> 7 60% would be closer to average
<Wrek> 05no strafe~
<jcelios> Par os 30s :o
<Kjakings> 7 85% would be something of a bad batch
<Buytoast> I guess you have great masterdoom at this game then.
<Stormy> wow, what websites are you looking at for ponies? o.o
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy http://i.imgur.com/ZbAlF.jpg

<Stormy> well first I have to learn how to crochet :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I don't know where id put it. but id find a place.
<Wrek> 05thye cant
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Hmmm… seems like a lot of work
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Shizuka> they can change the level title and graphics with some haxing, but not the par time, that's hardcoded
<Stormy> I still want to make those plushes
<Kjakings> 7I'm off for the night, fillies and colts.
<Stormy> see ya
<DashWithRainbows> You came to the wrong neighbourhood, Wrek.

<Bronysith> Alchemist: fluttershy is useless, i cant believe she forgets shes a pegasus
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.minus.com/iE8nEjmu51rGN.gif
<Bronysith> although TBF twilight forgets shes a unicorn >.>
<Alchemist> Bronysith: you could say, she's too shy to flutter? :D
*Bronysith grabs Alchemist and takes him to bed
<Bronysith> im off to guild wars 2
<jcelios> ragging on fluttershy AND twilight? you better believe thats a paddlin
*Bronysith throws down a smoke bomb
<Dark_Horst> they pretty much established that self levitation is hard
<Alchemist> what just happened?
<Dark_Horst> so i dont really think that would've done anything for the whole group
<Chrysalis> Dark_Horst reversing gravity hower
<Chrysalis> easyt
<Dark_Horst> that would've just fired them into space
<Chrysalis> easy*
<Dark_Horst> but yeah
<jcelios> spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
<Dark_Horst> thsoe are wonky arcane mechanics
<Chrysalis> no but if you can reverse gravity
<Chrysalis> why not just nullify it
<Chrysalis> or, reverse it slightly
<Dark_Horst> redirecting a force is easier than removing it?
<jcelios> because of the runic dismorphism in the untethered void
<Chrysalis> then point it into a cloud
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<Alchemist> and since many people compare the ep to Top gun, here is an "unorthodox" approach to the movie :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyN8VN4BSzM
<Stormy> haha
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight everyone :)
<Dark_Horst> well, that would've requitred the ckloud to be really really dense
<Dark_Horst> what rainbow dash did, int he end
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> i could just paste pics all day.
<Alchemist> good night MLP_Brovakiin !

<SirGanjalf> "Gee Gordon, looks like your MIT studies really pay off"
<DocSane> Canadian_Brony: He was rushing around, finding sick animals that he took to his cottage to cure. He was totally Fluttershy
<Epic> :O
<Neotyguy40> It's basically a security check that certain programs use
<Neotyguy40> Pandora
<Canadian_Brony> DocSane and he has absolutely no social skills whatsoever.

<ROFLPIZZA> Oh my God, that is genius.
<ThunderBlaze> BLASTING OFF AGAIN
<Darf14> Target Aquired!
<Snowden|Tittles> No hard feelings
<SirGanjalf> Is this black mesa, or is this a fantasy? Caught in a vent shaft, no escape from alien zombies.
<ThunderBlaze> Prepare for ASSIMILATION
<Darf14> huh, didnt know you could do that
<Snowden|Tittles> well...
<ThunderBlaze> You are excused
<ROFLPIZZA> XD
*jcelios hi-fives BerryPunch
<Hisin> lo
<ThunderBlaze> Derp
<magmablock> Wow
<SirGanjalf> eediots
<Darf14> Dang, if he only had a portal gun
<Barbetos> Where did the.. oh there he is
<magmablock> America's finest, everyone
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Snowden|Tittles> ...\
<ThunderBlaze> Anyone want some McD Fries?
<Snowden|Tittles> ThunderBlaze: toss one here
<Bronysith> fuckt hat
<Bronysith> id rather have 5 guys fries
<ThunderBlaze> SnowdenTittles: Throws one though webcam
<magmablock> Kinda wish you could jump just a tad bit higher so that not every single solitary jump had to be a crouch
<Hisin> Gorden lets fucking everyone get murdered
<SirGanjalf> Hey, it's the
<DemoPegono> o-e
*Snowden|Tittles catches fries
<SirGanjalf> *Hey, it's the "rescue
<Darf14> The Military messed with the wrong Scientist
<SirGanjalf> team
<Snowden|Tittles> ThunderBlaze: Thank You
<Darf14> Boom Headshot!
<ThunderBlaze> Snowden|Tittles: No prob
<ThunderBlaze> WHAT HAPPENED
<rcman914> lag?
<Barbetos> Used one boolet? Reload whole clip!
<magmablock> Loading...
<Hisin> yah lag
<ThunderBlaze> oh
<ThunderBlaze> XD
<Barbetos> Still have all the extra boolets
<ROFLPIZZA> Boolet.
<Barbetos> it is science
<ThunderBlaze> I just remembered that happens with Portal
<Barbetos> I have only played a few games where you use a clip and it uses the whole thing if you reload early
<ROFLPIZZA> I hate those. It's so... URGH
<magmablock> POWER AT MAXIMUUUUUUUUM
<Sumica> 00,10now she can solve 800 problems a min
<Barbetos> and more often then not it was a mod for quake 2 and it could not keep track like HL1 becuase of limitations from the engine.
<ThunderBlaze> Is wrek streaming this?
<Meth> cya
<Barbetos> Nope
<Barbetos> Its shizuka
<Barbetos> She plays the cool games.
<Barbetos> XD
<Hisin> Did Gorden actually learn to use those guns or did he already know? I didn't realize combat training was necessary to become a physicist?
<ThunderBlaze> So does Wrek
<Meth> i like 80s rock music
<SirGanjalf> Hisin: There's a shooting range at Black Mesa
<Snowden|Tittles> Hisin: not normally, but at Black Mesa...
<ThunderBlaze> ...
<ThunderBlaze> Not bad...
<ThunderBlaze> SOUND THE ALARM
<Barbetos> Hisin this game has a weak story as far as that short of thing goes. There are training courses aparently
<Canadian_Brony> Wrek plays cool games, draws cool stuff, and listens to cool music. Shizuka is an all-around badass in everything.
<DocSane> At Black Mesa, you get on the job combat training.
<Barbetos> lol. what a bunch of hams
<ThunderBlaze> Dat run
<Barbetos> I like all the streams =P
<rcman914> HEAD HUMPERS
<Barbetos> Scoots are particularly fun though.
<Hisin> Probably to fight the abominations they create every tuesday
<ThunderBlaze> ...
<jcelios> I would not say Half Life has a weak story :(
<ThunderBlaze> I am a Valve fan
<Bronysith> personally
<Bronysith> i dont get the hype of half life
<ThunderBlaze> I even have Dota 2 but i barely play it
<ROFLPIZZA> Every Black Mesa employee is provided with a standard-issue crowbar.
<Barbetos> Handle without care
<ThunderBlaze> ROFLPIZZA: XD
<Barbetos> you rebel
<jcelios> Bronysith: did you play it around the time it came out?
<Meth> so... whos on?
<Hisin> Anyway half like 3 is vapourware its never gonna come out, just like FIinal Fantasy versus 13
<Afflict> me
<Stormy> I'm still here
<Bronysith> final fantasy is dead
<Hisin> life*
<Stormy> going to be making dinner soon probably
<Barbetos> ROFLPIZZA no no no that is a VALVE employee
<ThunderBlaze> Barbetos: True
<SirGanjalf> Hisin: Valve is probably waiting for next gen
<ROFLPIZZA> No, Valve employees are given manditory knob implants in their heads.
<Darf14> well im off to play some games, cya :)
<Barbetos> Valve is making childrens games now
<Barbetos> True story
<Hisin> If they are waiting for the next gen it better be the best next gen game that ever will exist in the confines of space and time.
<Canadian_Brony> my leg!
<DocSane> Agh! My ovaries!
<Sumica> 00,10I had alot of fun with those turrets and the train
<ROFLPIZZA> My epidermis!
<DocSane> Guk! My duodenum!
*Bronysith protects Sumica from the turrets
<ThunderBlaze> One time in Borderlands 2... " I used to be a vault hunter like you but then i took a bullet to the knee" TRUE STORY!
<Sumica> 00,10stuck the turrets all over the front of the train
<ThunderBlaze> Not a joke they actually did it
<Hisin> Yeah i got that to thunder
<Bronysith> ThunderBlaze: yea, borderlands 2 is just one big meme
<Sumica> 00,10and ust cruse the rails
<DocSane> In HL2, I ended up carrying four turrets around with me in the prison.
<Bronysith> ThunderBlaze: it is one big breeding ground for internet memes
<SirGanjalf> Ow, my liver! Ow, my lasagna!
<Barbetos> Bronysith sooo.. in other words... a bunch of crap.
<Barbetos> =D
<ThunderBlaze> Dat range
<Bronysith> Barbetos: a bunch of overrated hyped up shit
<DocSane> Set them up at the end of the level with the turrets that were in the room already.
<ThunderBlaze> I thought that was a shotgun for a second there
<DocSane> It was absurd. The combine couldn't touch me.
<Neotyguy40> I'm here
<ROFLPIZZA> But then they did.
<ROFLPIZZA> DUN DUN DUN
<Afflict> Meth check your skype
<ThunderBlaze> Anyone here collect Pony cards
<DocSane> Ponies? What's that?
<Hisin> Borderlands is the most addictive PS3 game ever I only stopped playing it because I started playing something more addictive: Minecraft.
<ThunderBlaze> Mincraft is addicting
<ROFLPIZZA> Linecraft.
<Bronysith> the NSFW community is much more enjoyable than the SFW part of the bronies
<rcman914> Who is ready for the end of the world this friday?
<ThunderBlaze> I gotta admit But i needs monies for that
<Meth> ok

<Bronysith> RDR was a masterpiece
<Snowden|Tittles> 's Fine
<ThunderBlaze> RDR was good
<Bronysith> ThunderBlaze: false
<Bronysith> Masterpiece
<Hisin> RDR was frikkin awesome, i wish i hadn't broken mine
<ThunderBlaze> What about GoW
<Barbetos> I bought Two copies of RDR
<ThunderBlaze> I loved the franchise before i went PC gaming
<Barbetos> My brother lost his though.
<Barbetos> Or it was stolen.
<Barbetos> Or something
<Barbetos> I dunno
<Bronysith> too bad theres no pc version of it
<ThunderBlaze> or it was stolen... I dunno >_>

<EggNog5000> the soundtrack for this game is pretty good in my opinion
<SirGanjalf> Run.
*sonicdude558 punches Bronysith in the crotch
<Meth> What you think Afflict?
<Canadian_Brony> ow
<Neotyguy40> In high school, sophmore and freshman status isn't really important
<Meth> What you think Spyrorocks, Stormy?
*Barbetos gives Bronysith a Rawket Lawnchair
<Neotyguy40> Or at least not in my school
<DiscSlash> die!!!
<Meth> I know, but she is my friend's girl
<Sumica> 00,10dose the beast realy warrent this sad music?

<SirWrathy> BURN!
<Drew> Fallout

<Drew> ?
<Drew> noo
<twilight_sprinkle> the beast just wanted a hug
<Neotyguy40> Is she actually flirting with you? Or is she just nice?
<EggNog5000> twilight_sprinkle: a big spiky death-hug
<DiscSlash> and thats why i just finished this game 3 times
<Meth> Flirting
<twilight_sprinkle> but gordon killed it without remorse, hence the music
<sonicdude558> good night Shizuka
<Kandarihu> The beast warrants the epic showdown music.
<Barbetos> This is waht I imagine everytime I spray a roach with bug spray... and a ligther.
<SirWrathy> ure the boss, dont kill him, he respects ya
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica hmm, nah
<magmablock> Fun fact: The only manmade thing louder than a rocket engine is a nuke. Everyone in the area should be deaf
<gears> dawwwwwwwwwwwwww
<SirWrathy> xD
<Shizuka> 13so

<Cypresswolf> Yesh :)
<Canadian_Brony> seeya sonicdude558
<Kandarihu> Hmm, right when I'm shutting down my Firefox in preparation for a restart.
<Barbetos> That pic makes me sleepy
<gigaproblem> :)
<Neotyguy40> If it's hard to explain
<Neotyguy40> She is most likely NOT flirting with you
<Barbetos> I need more caffiene.
<Meth> Its like we are always talking to each other, and she acts differently than other girls - Like shes always smiling, she jokes around with me, we have a good time. It is also different than being nice
<Meth> Cause she always talks to me
<gears> omg its MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<ThunderBlaze> MERNCREFT!
<Neotyguy40> Welcome to high school
<jcelios> NEINRAFT
<Meth> lol
<Barbetos> caffiene is going to be one hell of a habbit to kick for me.
<pony_4908> LOL CHAT NO WORK
<Neotyguy40> Where people of different genders actually talk to each other a lot
<AbsoluteZero> minceraft
<DiscSlash> lol chat yes work
<Neotyguy40> With little gender gap in interests depending on the group
<Meth> So, I think I should just play it off, and wait for there relationship to end, then tak my chance
<Meth> lol i know
<Neotyguy40> Good call
<Barbetos> They said you could not be clothed by pictures.
<Meth> I should buy her a pony :p
<Neotyguy40> Don't get involved yet
<Meth> SR, Hook me up
<Barbetos> Minecraft has proven everyone wrong.
<Meth> Yeah, especially since my friend is with her
<EggNog5000> i will never fully understand the workings of tekkit
<pony_4908> I wish you could just take the items out of the frames without destroying the frames altogether.
<ThunderBlaze> Is this game in steam yet?
<Barbetos> nope
<pony_4908> I don't think it's ever going on Steam.
<Canadian_Brony> never will
<ThunderBlaze> Damn i really would like this game in steam
<ThunderBlaze> Why not?
<Barbetos> Why put it on steam when they don't need to pay the monies for it?
<Canadian_Brony> Notch said so
<DiscSlash> because :Notch:
<EggNog5000> Shizuka: i know how you feel :D
<Barbetos> They make a better profit selling it from their site
<ThunderBlaze> woah she made this?
<Barbetos> Steam would want like.. two fiddy a sale.
<Meth> Hopefully I dont get Friend Zoned
<EggNog5000> ThunderBlaze: no, the ghosts did
