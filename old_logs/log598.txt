<Kandarihu> Who built the robot lions?
<Nyst> Swaglions.
<Broken_Heart> Yeah, true, the film is a butt-burning three hours long... but it has plenty of musical intermissions, meaning one could get plenty of chances for a bathroom break. Three hours, yeah; but your bladder can survive it....
<AttacktheAndalite> pony_1504: Nope

<Kandarihu> Aguirre was a true B Movie. It rode on the humor of us, especially Ghosties.
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: FIVE THIRTY.
<Silverscreen> 01,11As for as anything new or innovative, there's nothing to take from this movie. But I have to say, it's wonderfully entertaining and asks a lot of challenging questions in its story. It's also well paced, even in the rushed sections, and well acted, and gives a lot to think about if you look past the simple story. And then there's teh action and the music sequences. Both were interesting
<Silverscreen> 1,11and entertaining, and in the second half of the film, they added a lot of suspense as well. This movie had it all, and I mean it had it ALL. If this was the director's dream masterpiece, then I say he succeeded in giving us said masterpiece.

<MDL> guns everywhere
<DocSane> twilight_sprinkle: About 15 minutes long and nonsensical?
<WRITEity> all of that stuff I just explained to you?
<Reikim> So yeah, that extended ellipsis pretty much encapsulates my thoughts on the matter.
<AttacktheAndalite> I know one time I had my arm back to throw the ball, it dropped out my hand and plopped on the ground. My friend was literally on the floor laughing
<AlienWarhead> I needed this pony break

<RX-78-SweetieBot> hard boiled? Clearly I should vote for Kamen Rider W: A to Z the Gaia Memories of Fate
<Pale_Horse> I wonder what would happen if Zecora accidentally ended a sentece with the word "Orange" by mistake... 6_9
<Tovler> There's still Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle, Kung Pao
<Stormfox> need the witch doctor song XD

<Reikim> CASSHERN!
<mishnia> Zecora cause shes horse-related
<pony_7216> Colgate must lose a lot of business to her because of that.
<Canadian_Brony> dat quick fix-up
<DuskStarshimmer> star apples
<Crippler> Zecora is my favorite reccuring character
<JESmith71> |Maybe because zebra's are close enough to horses they can get them too?
<fluttercry> 05,15TheGreatAndPowerfulT yeah, as much as I love that film, it would start one hell of a shit storm
<RX-78-SweetieBot> CASHEW?

<Tassadork> whoever's doing the woahs is spot on tonight
<Kencolt> Oh, how I wish dentristry was so easy here...
<Tovler> I'm sticking with Big Fish for A.
<CrimsonPhoenix> For Zercora's case I thought it was only a tatoo
<mishnia> that mark is tattoo used in her tribe
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good se...nevermind.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fluttercry same with downfall ....
<twilight_sprinkle> wink-wink

<CrimsonPhoenix> I do want more of Zecora
<otakon> Zecora is not attracted to plot it seems
<sonicandmario85> fiane XD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Chronicle I mean
<Canadian_Brony> otakon she's a silly filly
<CrimsonPhoenix> I really love her character
<WRITEity> SaxyPretender: it's out on DVD, and it's available on torrents
<fluttercry> 05,15Nudist Colony of the Dead sounds like a softcore porno
<richfiles> Rooster Viagra! BWAHAHAHA! :D
<Ponies47> Zecora is cool
<WRITEity> came out in February
<DuskStarshimmer> Rooster gets all the chicks
<hen3ry> until a second Zebra is shown, Zecora's mark's meaning is unknown.
<Xaiden|Okari> zecora has quite da ass
<OohShiny> if you know what I mean
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I do hope Meanwhile's B movie gets shown at some point
<Reikim> ^^
<Tovler> I can already seen the Apple Bloom and Story of the Blanks spam with Big Fish
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: *shrugs shoulders* I don't get it either.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: do you want the silly answer or the srs one?
<Kencolt> TYHe rooster has lost his... Yeah, RIGHT.
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix which one, Zecora or Apple Bloom?
<WRITEity> fluttercry: and yet it's actually a Horror/Comedy/Musical
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zecora
<otakon> Chronicle is out on DVD
<joshman129> I could totally see alchem/potion making being Apple Bloom's special talent.
<Silverscreen> 01,11that rhyme was horrid.
<DuskStarshimmer> :$
<Megan> rhymes too much :/
<Reikim> I've been voting Street Fighter for a while, because I want to see that movie.
<scottish-geeky> Zecora
<CrimsonPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, please read a bit up
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon x DVD
<otakon> Reikim: which one?
<Allegr0> maan, I want more Zecora in my life
<SaxyPretender> 0,14wait, which one?
<hen3ry> they can't all be winners.
<fluttercry> 05,15what is Chronical?
<Canadian_Brony> Silverscreen can't all be perfect
<Pale_Horse> In my head-canon the marks for Zebras magically appear just like they do for ponies, but they are just more abstract than the marks for ponies is all.
<Polydunami> Zecora is underrated. And that is an understatement.
<MDL> if applebloom has seen the flower in ponyville, why did she need to steal it?
<fluttercry> 05,15le*
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's like not even 5 lines up
<Reikim> otakon: The hammy one that's famous.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Chronicle is a "found film" type o movie
<Reikim> The one with M. Bison being hammy.
<WRITEity> fluttercry: basically the closest thing you'll get to an AKIRA movie that doesn't suck.
<otakon> fluttercry: shaky cam recordings of middle aged guys getting telekinetic powers
<Canadian_Brony> Amethyst is a jem
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Its Installation 04!

<DuskStarshimmer> Dat flank
<Xaiden|Okari> a circle
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm going to go down that river and kick Bison's ass!
<Kencolt> It's a simple fact that Zecora hates Oranges. Because she can't ask for them.
<Shooeie> Tron Disk?
<Soul> zecora is best zebra
<AlienWarhead> Girl look at that body
<Tovler> weird how Chronicle didn't rejected by the mods for being to recent.

<Shooeie> Tron Disk
<otakon> Tovler: bc it's out on DVD
<JESmith71> If the ring was colored gold, it means her talent is being good at playing Sonic
<Quick_Thinker> a circle is a pretty suck cutie mark
<Crippler> A ZERO
<Reikim> WRITEity: But...there was a movie for AKIRA. Animated. It was pretty good.
<MDL> sanic
<Big_Macintosh_1992> can I put out a question? Shouldn't all her cutie marks appear on both sides of her body?
<Allegr0> lowfn: the question is, who has the other side?
<otakon> Twisp
<Ponies47> Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh you! :D
<Crippler> IT'S A BIG FAT ZERO

<mishnia> Quick_Thinker: leave! quick!!
<Reikim> WRITEity: Congrats, you've pitched an anime to me. (bastard now I have to binge on it.)
<Pale_Horse> I actually think that Diamond is the real bad influence between the two and that Silver Spoon would mellow out and become nicer if she could just be gotten away from DT's poison influence.
<Kencolt> Azuredragon: GAH! THAT WORKS!
<AJIsAwesome> Lyra: A Human?!

<AJIsAwesome> Shooie: Same thought here.

<scottish-geeky> HAHAHA
<mishnia> Main Equestria has parts of rome America and England in it
<Bjornfot> last time i went to tvtropes, i didn't return for 4 hours
<Kencolt> Personally, I think that Derpy's marks aren't bubbles but map co-ordinates, since she's a mailmare. ALWAYS delivers to the right place-- the mail. Which is why she's no good as a weatherpony. What was RD thinking?
<AJIsAwesome> Why do people hate Spike so much? Sure he isn't the nicest character out of the bunch, but he has a lot of wisdom to share.
<Canadian_Brony> she would do well in the Olympics.
<OohShiny> French in Equestria?

<WRITEity> It still confuses me that the best VN I've ever played was one made by 4Chan
<otakon> they'll never do it

<Pale_Horse> However, if Zecora HADN'T had business in town, she would totally have gotten a heads-up from her Zebra Sense. :)
<Reikim> Rika is best moe in that show. Just puttin' that out there without spoilerin' anything.
<Starlight_Phoenix> Sounds legit

<Shooeie> I kinda wanted to keep the Saint one

<hen3ry> Sabershy: cannibalism? How so?
<Pale_Horse> Apple Bloom! Apple Bloom! Apple Bloom! Apple Bloom! :P
<mishnia> superretroworld: they are tribal tatoos i belive, since this "cutiemark" of hers is not adressed as a cutiemark and even so has no resmblace to her talent....even through the somtimes cryptic smybolsim of cutiemarks (cherrlies cutiemark *sigh*)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon: nope
<otakon> goddamn shotacon
<Xaiden|Okari> Scoots needs her own episode.... just sayin
<[Alpha]> :D
<otakon> SHOTA
<otakon> NO
<CriticKitten> Zecora's Batman
<OohShiny> she always has money to fix the mess in her hut
<mishnia> Appy Boom :3
<Shooeie> What did she learn?
<DuskStarshimmer> Spahk
<DocSane> And then immediately forgetting any lesson learned
<Sabershy> hen3ry: No idea. :)
<OohShiny> how?
<GabeMoist> Umineko has an amazing soundtrack
<lowfn> Twilight you so lazy
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 YES. It keeps me insane when I don't have muffins.
<otakon> goddamn pedophilia
<richfiles> I used to pick the lock to a storage building behind the public school in my town to warm up when I biked to work in winter! It's the truth! :$
<DuskStarshimmer> Hi Gurlz!
<WRITEity> IMO, the only bad path in KS is Shizne's
<GabeMoist> It's worth reading just for that
<MDL> i wish some of my ex-friends would've thought that way.... but nope, one mistake from me and they cast me off D:
<Kencolt> AlienWarhead: Um... Objection overruled. Corn Cakes are not made from flour, but from cornmeal.
<Megan> she said c'lestia not celectia
<CriticKitten> Applebloom, would you do my homework for me?
<WRITEity> otakon: ...never watch an anime called Boku No Pico
<scottish-geeky> EDOCTION
<AJIsAwesome> Why do people hate Spike so much? Sure he isn't the nicest character out of the bunch, but he has a lot of wisdom to share.
<fluttercry> 05,15if you haven't played this, you should
<AlienWarhead> Kencolt nnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooo
<otakon> eeyup WRITEity
<OohShiny> waited too much
<mishnia> YAY
<Starlight_Phoenix> nope
<Reikim> I gotta play KS again...Emi's route touched my heartstrings, but I'm curious as to what happened with Hanako...
<DocSane> Delete lesson. Reset
<mishnia> happyending
<fluttercry> 05,15wait one moment
<thegt90> my mistake was key in light socket
<Canadian_Brony> Honesty

<DuskStarshimmer> tmeout(1200ms)
<[Alpha]> I knew it
<Ryunosuke> that patience
<hen3ry> aesop amnesia, engaged.
<JESmith71> Patience is up
<Kandarihu> The mark on Zecora's flank is consistant with the stripes on her coat. It's almost like it's an inherantly primative form of cutie marks.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WELP I WAITED LONG ENOUGH
<scottish-geeky> hah
<Megan> nope
<RX-78-SweetieBot> WRITEity: but the point is to get him to watch it and see how long it takes
<WRITEity> Reikim: Hanako's path is my personal fave
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Wow. I gotta admit Coco-Cola is good. What about Pepsi? :P
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: no one hates him, I know people who don't like Fluttershy
<[Alpha]> :O
<ObLiCody> off into the sunset
<Crippler> knifefighting!
<Polydunami> Uhh, I don't think many people HATE Spike, AJIsAwesome.

<Reikim> Friggin' role model for everyone
<pony_6346> yes
<Megan> wait a sec
<Canadian_Brony> pony1553 if they did already, neither was I. If they didn't, the trilogy will most likely be streamed this summer.
<GabeMoist> NO! Student council stopped me in my peak
<[Alpha]> Hey I've taken note that ever since I started fdrawing my penmanship has gotten better. That's good , right?
<xtremetoxicguy> My steam is xtemetoxicguy

<xtremetoxicguy> If, you want
<Reikim> Except that yeah
<Quick_Thinker> im pretty sure everypony here has a steam
<xtremetoxicguy> Glob
<Quick_Thinker> mine is Quick Thinker

<Sabershy> Alright everypony, I'm say goodnight! I'll come by soon enough.
<Quick_Thinker> and my skype is riogascar
<infernap12> mines Infernap12

<xtremetoxicguy> I'd be perfect for streaming, cuz I usually never sleep! :D
<adros1> well im gonna go to FIMfiction for awile so bye every pony
<[Alpha]> Good Night to those ponies thare leaving and may you dream of ponies
<superretroworld> i remember wen i was new to bronystate i told you guys did you know gabes a brony, which was two months ago :D
<[Alpha]> that are
<xtremetoxicguy> Yay, FIMFiction!
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le4_YYSo_Vk
<scottish-geeky> Maid_Angel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C-Qmzuib5g
<infernap12> wait what? gabes a brony?
<WRITEity> yeah. Every time Hisao tries to talk to her about getting her leg checked after the race, or tries to talk to her about her feelings, she kind of just shoves herself onto him to get him to shut up.
<infernap12> proof
<Reikim> Ah
<Reikim> Distraction
<Reikim> Makes more sense now
<Reikim> See, though, this is why I love this VN
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/7yBnl_krN_U
<Malavolent> Good morning.
<scottish-geeky> kaboom hahahah ho ho he he
<WRITEity> "I really want do know you better as a per-" "TITTIES!"
<Canadian_Brony> infernap12 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le4_YYSo_Vk
<Reikim> Again, why I love the VN. Not the titties, the fact that they have believable flaws.
<Canadian_Brony> wrong link
<xtremetoxicguy> infernap12: Notch is as well
<WRITEity> that's basically half their interactions during that path.
<superretroworld> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPjFavgKO5I i got it
<DuskStarshimmer> I thought there was an A moview left :c
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: what u up to
<infernap12> wow
<Reikim> Until she shoves him away completely.
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: Nothing much
<WRITEity> also, something I've noticed about the girls in KS: they all seem to love doing it in front of open windows.
<[Alpha]> Brony 4 ever
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> I
<Reikim> wouldn't know
<Reikim> Why would you notice that
<WRITEity> Shizne, Lilly, Hanako, and Emi all do it at some point.
<Reikim> Do you subconsciously look for the windows
<richfiles> Anypony picking up the stream later? Anything?
<xtremetoxicguy> I wonder if there are any bronies here....lol
<Reikim> What does this imply
<Canadian_Brony> xtremetoxicguy *raises hoof*
<WRITEity> no like, in the h-scenes, they actually have images of them RIGHT in front of open windows.
*RainbowJack hugs Canadian_Brony
*Canadian_Brony was hugged
<WRITEity> Hell, in emi's path, it's a PLOT POINT that they were dry humping in front of an open window.
<xtremetoxicguy> Canadian_Brony: WOW! A brony! /)
<Reikim> Maybe they like the breeze
<Canadian_Brony> xtremetoxicguy /)
<Reikim> Maybe a cool refreshing breeze is nice when...know...
<xtremetoxicguy> *hugs everyone
<Reikim> *yknow
*RainbowJack thinks everypony here is a Brony /)
<Sumica> 00,10yeah richfiles, SuperBrony64 will be picking it up here in a few
<richfiles> Nifty! :)
<WRITEity> I dunno, but every time I expected somebody to walk by and just be like "Well what's all this now?" and Hisao and his girl would get frog marched to the principal or something.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I really don't get scarface
<WRITEity> that's another thing.
<WRITEity> We see like...3 adults at that entire school.
<WRITEity> and only 1 is a teacher.
<Reikim> I DON'T KNOW I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT CONDITIONS ARE GOOD FOR SEX
<Canadian_Brony> watching "Whose Line". They're acting out a Chinese Action film called "Soma Noodle For You"
<BronyInstrumental> hey. what's up guys?
<Canadian_Brony> BronyInstrumental the sky
<WRITEity> Reikim: generally, sex in front of a window that people can see through isn't comfortable for non-exhibitionists.
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: u like brony muisc
<BronyInstrumental> cause that's not old at all xD
<Reikim> Maybe they figure most of their students are too disabled/emotionally scarred/pure for sex.
<Polydunami> Scarface?
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZvJRv7y4l0&feature=g-vrec
<Polydunami> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhsTmiK7Q2M
<scottish-geeky> RainbowJack: (\ you dont sya
<RainbowJack> why is Fluttershy dressed like a Aquaknot?
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: What do yeah think I'm listening to? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t38DPnkDjTM&feature=plcp
<xtremetoxicguy> Say hello to my little friend! *holds twilight gun*
<Reikim> Makes sense for Lilly, seeing as she can't see
<Reikim> Emi probably wouldn't care
<Canadian_Brony> hi!
<CrimsonPhoenix> by scarface I mean in batman
<Reikim> Dunno 'bout Shizune
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Give me a few min :)
<BronyInstrumental> Ponies47: nice choice /)
<Ponies47> xtremetoxicguy: o.o
*Canadian_Brony is batman
<Reikim> Doing it in front of a window is...weird for Hanako
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K-I5l58Jxc this is what im lising to
<xtremetoxicguy> Makin bacon pancakes!
<Canadian_Brony> nice
<WRITEity> Considering shizne's first H scene involves her tying Hisao to a chair, she probably enjoys the idea
<Polydunami> I thought that was Two Face, CrimsonPhoenix :P
<pony1553> I`m listening to Eurobeat Brony-Discord(livingtombstone remix)
<Reikim> Erm
<Canadian_Brony> pony1553 /)
*BronyInstrumental has entered haters gonna hate mode
<CrimsonPhoenix> Polydunami, there's a villain named scarface in batman
<CrimsonPhoenix> a puppet
<Reikim> ...Actually, Shizune would do that, now that I think about it.
<xtremetoxicguy> you mean twoface
<Polydunami> Yeah, Two Face.
<scottish-geeky> Canadian_Brony: lise

<CrimsonPhoenix> there's a villain named scarface in batman
<Canadian_Brony> scottish-geeky lise? What is lise?
<Reikim> I laughed so hard at the same time that I was hilariously uncomfortable.

<WRITEity> I couldn't stop laughing at her FACE during that. AND THEY USED THE WHOLE TUBE.

<PsychoticDoc> 360 controller
<Buytoast> sure it has no replayability and it's repetitive as hell, but it has some entertaining moments
<CrimsonPhoenix> Buytoast, you mean fan-pandering moments/
<CrimsonPhoenix> ?**
<Ponies47> richfiles: That game is streamed way to much! :[
<JESmith71> It could be PC using 360 controller
<Buytoast> i dunno about fan pandering, never played the others
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: what game is streemed to much
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: Kerbal Space Program
<Canadian_Brony> I'm guessing he's using a special input device that allows whatever output a 360 would use and displays it onto his computer, which he then live records and streams
<JESmith71> Kerbal
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: agrred
<Insane_> Hay
<BronyInstrumental> i wonder how long it'll take me to pass out.......
<Buytoast> this game is more awful than terrible

<twilight_sprinkle> derpy_pony: only thing i can think of is rip their spaghetti hair out and replace it with something else
<PuddingCupz> its a video a music video.
<cratorkid> Quick_Thinker: cool , im drawing octavia
<Quick_Thinker> actually it is a video just a video of music
<pony1553> I only see a picture
<richfiles> And really... They are only $5, so for that price, tehy are actually impressive. Better than the big plushie
<Quick_Thinker> seriously has any pony here beat spelunky and why did my zombie panic source just update?
<HoodyNinja> Quick_Thinker: zombie panick source?
<pony1553> This making me sleepy*yawn*
<Quick_Thinker> steam mod
<HoodyNinja> okay i thought the zombies were attacking again
<Quick_Thinker> ?

<richfiles> Anypony have any of the new Three Pack Molded pony sets? You know, with Gilda and Granny Smith and Cadance,a dn so on?
<twilight_sprinkle> richfiles: 5$ Is impressive. but the spaghetti hair is a problem
*Ponies47 Sings "Hush Now Quiet Now" to pony1553

<PuddingCupz> 6_9 Derp.
<Ponies47> Herp
<HoodyNinja> Burp
<richfiles> I bought all three sets, as well as all three plushies. I think the spaghetti hair is actually better than the fuzz hair. It's more like slit felt strips, so it lays over flat.
<PuddingCupz> :'( its not even almost don yet?
<pony1553> I landed on a fork
<[Alpha]> he did it :o

<richfiles> OK... But they ARE cheap. $5 cheap. You can't really expect Hasbro to match the quality of hand made stuff and put it in stores. It would not be economical. It HAS to be cheap to make... Cheap enough to sell in quantitiy
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: YEEEEEEE. Awww. that's ok.
<Buytoast> a van goghesque background for a boo level

<HoodyNinja> Buytoast: What happend to the classics :/
<PuddingCupz> like they would say OWWWW or stuff
<richfiles> My SNES is a circuit board with a crescent wrench clamped onto the voltage regulator cause it's missing a heat sink... Not even joking about that! A buddy made a 9 hour no deaths run through Link To the Past on it! :)
<Buytoast> i wonder if i could convince my grandma to let me buy her SNES off her
<Ponies47> No they only time they talk is when Tom screams in pain that's pretty much it :P
<Buytoast> the classics are too violent for our precious little assholes these days

<Chrysalis> although... the gun on the right only shoots 1 round, the one on the left shoots 2
<Chrysalis> both have the same reload
<bob> must be a bug
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Fighting in the clouds looks cool
<Chrysalis> game install faster!
<[Alpha]> Do you ponies know any good party music?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> party hard ?
<Chrysalis> [Alpha] look for the Baloon Party album if youv not heard of it
<Chrysalis> huh, not both are only firing one
<Chrysalis> now*
<[Alpha]> Holy crap it's an hour long
<Chrysalis> oh no, left is back to 2

<Chrysalis> yeah thats some serious echo
<MadSurge> Hello alexxm! :$
<Jim> Didn't get into the match :/
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i miss my music so much right now need to download it soon
<Chrysalis> guns of icarus why you have really ODD starting position
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that echo
<[Alpha]> Good thing I'm intelligent
<Chrysalis> i have no idea what im doing on this game
<Chrysalis> any sort of practice mode/
<Jim> Chrysalis, You could go sandbox mode
<Spriggals> Way to use your wrench
<alexxm> hey MadSurge how've ypu been
<MadSurge> I can barely hear Wrek in the background :D
<Jim> Chrysalis, When Wrek finishes his game we should get into a game together
<Jim> I'll pilot, Wrek shoots stuff and you could be out combat engineer
<[Alpha]> I prefer my keyboard over ipad keyboard I make less errors in typing out sentences
<Chrysalis> cool ill play skirmish till then as i have absolutely NO idea what im doing
<Chrysalis> awesome
<Chrysalis> OMG THERES HATS XD
<Chrysalis> and goggles :O
<Spriggals> The goggles they do nothing!
<[Alpha]> XD
<Jim> Chrysalis, HAT FLYING FORTRESS
<[Alpha]> I want to play this now :
<Chrysalis> hear you
<Chrysalis> but still echo
<Spriggals> Holy crap your accent is awsome
<MadSurge> That's better Wrek :D
<alexxm> is this game good
<MadSurge> You're echoing a bit though
<Jim> You should swap the wrench for a rubber mallet
<Chrysalis> much
<MadSurge> Yes
<[Alpha]> For some reason Makkon the little toy shop fits this game o.0
<Hrafn> hi everyone :3
<Spriggals> No echoy
<Chrysalis> no echo
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> No echo Wrek
<alexxm> how you doing Hrafn
<Hrafn> not bad, just woke up, you?
<Chrysalis> right, so wheres this sandbox mode?
<Jim> after you click skrimish, you click the arrows to swap game mode
<Chrysalis> ahhh, thanks
<[Alpha]> I would gladly play this game if you ponies where there
<Chrysalis> cool, ill go sandbox as engineer then
<Jim> Wrek, You activate the mod by selecting them with 2, 3, 4

<alexxm> bye SuperBrony64|Zzz
<alexxm> so is this game good
<noname> Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Jim> Wrek, I'd recommend getting the heavy duty spring loadout, which decreases reload time, but damages the weapon
<Spriggals> and then they were dead
<Jim> since you can repair it
<[Alpha]> The only reason I asked for party music is simply that my church is letting us pick out the music for the music and I wanted to add brony music
<Chrysalis> jim also, ill be dedicated engineer so surely weapon damage isnt an issue?
<alexxm> is this team fortress with air ships
<Jim> yeah

<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm back, everypony. =_=
<AdamTheDuck> hey Phase4, did you ever get any of the Bethesda games working?
<d3rb> hello Spell-of-Gaming
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, other than morrowind nope
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Spell-of-Gaming
<Phase4> 00,02new vegas works kinda
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have a sudden craving for noodles AND mushrooms. Whyyyyyyyyyy.
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<d3rb> hey Lil_B
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4: Kind of? Do elaborate.
<Serenity> I'm back with Pizza
<Lil_B> thanks d3rb :)
<Lil_B> what is wrek playing?
<d3rb> its not nice to tease Serenity, now i want pizza.
<AdamTheDuck> Serenity: Shouldn't you be saving that monthly money?
<TrixieMuffins> wow , this fic has a heck of an interesting theory on the origin of changelings.
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B: Guns of Icarus
<Serenity> AdamTheDuck: Peh, with the firepower I've got, I could probably rob a bank
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't know if it's pure coincidence or not, but there's an old horror movie in my country named "The Changeling"
<[Alpha]> what is it about?
<[Alpha]> axactly
<[Alpha]> exactly
<Spell-of-Gaming> Funny thing is, two of the animation studios for MLP: FiM are on the Philippines
<MegaMoonShine> Really? That's pretty cool
<[Alpha]> Sweet
<Commander_Shepard> what's this game?
<Spell-of-Gaming> And the Philippines is where the movie came from
<MegaMoonShine> Though it is probably just a coincidence
<[Alpha]> Guns of Icarus
<Commander_Shepard> Multiplayer?
<MegaMoonShine> Yes
<[Alpha]> yes
<MegaMoonShine> Is this free to play btw?
<Commander_Shepard> Wrek and Sumica?
<[Alpha]> but it's a closed beta
<Jim> nope
<d3rb> nah
<d3rb> its realtively cheap though
<Serenity> Commander_Shepard: Sounds like it, but apparently not
<Spell-of-Gaming> Does this game even have any relation with the greek myth "Icarus"?
<Serenity> Spell-of-Gaming: DUH, the title
<Spell-of-Gaming> I remember it being a greek myth
<MegaMoonShine> I think phase is playing aswell
<[Alpha]> yes he is
<Spell-of-Gaming> I mean gameplay. =_=
<Spell-of-Gaming> One more time you do something like that, I'll kill you.
<Kandarihu> Guns of people who are going too high, I guess
<[Alpha]> ...?
<Serenity> Of course you will *Holds up rocket launcher and quantum body armour*
<Spell-of-Gaming> Bitch please.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have magic spells.
<TrixieMuffins> So acording to this , Changelings were once the Flutterponies , driven underground when fluttervalley went volcanic and , as their numbers dwindled and food became scarce , "saved" by discord by turning them into emotivores. Joke's on them cause now that they look like monsters , while they feed on love , hate is poisonous to them , and looking like they do .......
<TrixieMuffins> discuss
<[Alpha]> That sounds really cool actually
<AdamTheDuck> Bitch please, I have duct tape Spell-of-Gaming
<d3rb> what are the flutterponies?
<Kandarihu> Phase4 is saying that he has a bad mic.
<TrixieMuffins> Flutterponies were in G1 ? , they defeated the Smooze
<Kandarihu> TrixieMuffins, that Is a good theory
<Spell-of-Gaming> Flutterponies were in G3, not G1.
<TrixieMuffins> my bad
<Kandarihu> Yup. They stopped the Smooze.
<Jim> Now that was a fun game
<Kandarihu> Spell-of-Gaming, no. They were G1
<d3rb> interesting theory though TrixieMuffins
<[Alpha]> oh that's where they got the smooze stuff I thought they made that up
<MegaMoonShine> The ones in G3 were the Breezies
<Serenity> And now, time for phwee dee
<Spell-of-Gaming> A voice synthnizer can beat Justin Bieber's ass any day. :3
<[Alpha]> ^
<[Alpha]> :D
<TrixieMuffins> well if you'd like to read it "Mirror's Image" is the fic , premise is : Twilight is a changeling , heir to the hive , its not bad , around 10 chapters so far
<Phase4> 00,02that game needs srs work
<Phase4> 00,02but its looking good so far
<AdamTheDuck> Whoa what is Wrek making?

<[Alpha]> My guess something awesome
<MegaMoonShine> Gotta go now guys, might be back later
<AdamTheDuck> Bye MegaMoonShine
<AdamTheDuck> Damn so much buffer
<Spell-of-Gaming> AdamTheDuck: Here's a guess, does it contain sexual content? :P
<d3rb> catcha mega... gone
<Phase4> 00,02and then quantum conundrum crashed o_O
<AdamTheDuck> Spell-of-Gaming: Hurting the fuck out of people, Pedophilia, and Shit.
<Kandarihu> I really liked that Blender song.
<d3rb> fun for the whole family
<Spell-of-Gaming> AdamTheDuck: And people tell us we're crazy.
<[Alpha]> TrixieMuffin I read that one. It was good but I did not like they it turned out >.>
<AdamTheDuck> Who was the pony who used reverse psychology to tempt me to this fic?

<RaveBrony> [Alpha]: ^

<Jmo4267> not stupid enough?
<Jmo4267> wut
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Jim> How to make stuff: 1. Draw a circle. 2. Fill out the details
<Jim> Except if you're playing Minecraft
<Jim> Then it's: 1. Make a cube. 2. Fill out the details
<RaveBrony> Omg :D
<[Alpha]> I actaully have developed sketchihng the foreground before adding the detals
<Serenity> Jim: Draw a circle, then draw more circles, MORE CIRCLES, then fill in the details, and you're done
<Jim> Needs 20% more circles
<Jmo4267> And Serenity appears.
<Serenity> I've been here a while
<Jim> lurk lurk
<Jmo4267> I'm sure.

<RaveBrony> Hey Saturn! :)
<Serenity> inb4 yes guy from simpsons
<Jim> Because or else it would be really fucked up
<AdamTheDuck> Jim: Oh God if that was real...
<Serenity> Knowing EA, they probably have enough fuckwits in their community to actually follow that
<Jmo4267> ^
<Serenity> I mean, did you lot read that Runescape thread years ago
<Serenity> "Is it true there's gonna be a 3h weapon?"
<Saturn> 08,01>.>
<Saturn> 08,01<.<
<Jmo4267> 3h weapon. Legit.
<Jim> Well, where's your third hand for that sword? :P
<Serenity> A GM's reply was "Are you freaking stupid, of course not. We don't even have 3 hands!"

<Jim> What does the "Facebooking while Rome burns" mean?
<Eli> [Alpha]: yeah that too
<Jmo4267> What do you think?
<[Alpha]> I have not a clue
<Jim> I am blank
<Spell-of-Gaming> It refers to an article techcrunch posted, I think
<[Alpha]> I think it means the world could be falling apart but they will still be on facebook
<AdamTheDuck> Lol, I was thinking about Wrek's Brome being destroyed in 30 seconds when he spent 30 minutes building it
<Jmo4267> Harsh AdamTheDuck, harsh.
<Eli> it's about the guys who poste: "woah my house burns. i'm still in. lol"
<Jim> Some people ey
<Thrackerzod> hello

<Jim> Nope
<[Alpha]> no
<Chrysalis> they are MASSIVLY OP atm
<Chrysalis> heavy gets an AOE fire that maintains while stunned
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<Chrysalis> and the spy gets a new sapper which VERY quickly unmakes things
<Jmo4267> Hello Malavolent
<diddutz> Chrysalis: haven't had time to play them yet, but from viewing the weapons i thought it will end up that way
<Jim> hi Malavolent
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Malavolent
<Phase4> 00,02i am unimpressed with the quantum conundrum dlc
<Chrysalis> its significantly harder to actually destroy the buildings at least
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4: Do you need a hug? :P
<Chrysalis> but far easier to revert them to a lower level
<[Alpha]> fuuuu Team Fortess 2 is free and I didn't know
<Phase4> 00,02[Alpha], wat
*AdamTheDuck hugs Phase4 anyway
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, no but why not

<Malavolent> Too bad, I won't give you any.
<diddutz> [Alpha] where were you for the past year? O.o
<AdamTheDuck> :'(
<Thrackerzod> who is the band playing teh aweomseness?
<[Alpha]> PLaying xbox how many times do I have to say i just recently got steam and started pc gaming
<Malavolent> Wrek, whatcha doin'?
<Jmo4267> Oh that'd explain that
<Jmo4267> lolxbox
<[Alpha]> Silence not a word
<Jmo4267> LOLXBOX
<[Alpha]> :D
<Jim> Let me explain using a picture http://derpy.me/qfOct
<AdamTheDuck> [Alpha]: At least tell me you weren't playing CoD
<Jmo4267> If you say you were playing CoD I will shank you.
<d3rb> jim you speak the truth, do you have a newsletter i can subscribe to?
<Thrackerzod> Jim, you are correct
<[Alpha]> I bought Modern Warfare 3 Prestiged once thenit was dead to me but no I played all classes of games and acquired 20000 gamerscore
<Jmo4267> Oh Yahtzee, how I love thee humor.
<Jmo4267> You still played CoD, shanking time.
<Serenity> Yahtzee is hilarious
<Jim> d3rb, My daily newsletter consists of yelling randomly at the chat
<AdamTheDuck> IN THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE JIM?
<[Alpha]> Sue me
<d3rb> i will never have another holiday and miss a week of chat
<Jmo4267> I'd prefer shanking.
<[Alpha]> You can try
<Jmo4267> I will.
<[Alpha]> But you are not Pinkie Pie
<Jmo4267> You don't say.
<[Alpha]> ehh No point in speaking to you
<Jmo4267> ;D
<Jim> Oh lawd that would be epic http://i.imgur.com/yTA4n.jpg
<Jmo4267> Amnesia <3
<[Alpha]> Scary games are a walk in the park for me
<d3rb> ffs, i have to buy new speakers
<Braviary> So I didn't get to see the end of Scott Pilgrim. Was it as good in the end as it was for the rest of the movie?
<Jim> With the most advanced virtual reality headset? That would be fucking scary
<Kandarihu> Braviary, eeyup
<Thrackerzod> excpeted i dont find the game scary
<[Alpha]> ^
<Wrek> 05this will work :D
<Thrackerzod> btw Alpha cod is a terrbile game, so dont feel on my side
<[Alpha]> I've taken not you PC gamers think you ar ehigh and mighty. May I ask why?
<[Alpha]> note
<eleanorawesome> fancy schmancy
<Jmo4267> LOL.
<Thrackerzod> Im not high and mighty, i just simply have a better system to play my games on that dosnet get hack3d or red ringed
<Jim> Must I explain again? http://derpy.me/swaOx
<Jmo4267> dis gun b gewd.
<Thrackerzod> :3
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<Eli> i don't actually care where i play my game. Pc games are sometimes more refined, but holding a controller in your hand is just... i don't know... cooler?
<[Alpha]> That explains little except that you are arrogant
<d3rb> pc gamers need to justify their expensive systems [Alpha]
<Jim> ^
<eleanorawesome> You can't pony on a consile
*Jmo4267 pokes Chrysalis
<Thrackerzod> Jim /)
<eleanorawesome> console*
<Jim> (\
<[Alpha]> Well I do give you pc gamers the satisfaction of awesome modding
<Eli> d3rb: meh. i have my pc and i let my brothers buy my consoles
<AdamTheDuck> [Alpha]: There are a few reasons... But I cbf making a counter argument xD
<diddutz> Why PC is better: There will be no pony games for consoles (as far as i know...)
<d3rb> cant we all just get along, have a pc and a console!
<Thrackerzod> Tell me one thing your xbox can do that my pc cant
<Jmo4267> RROD. HAHAHA
<eleanorawesome> play MW3 well
<d3rb> play gt5
<Eli> diddutz: no some pony games will be out for WiiU as far as i know
<Thrackerzod> i can do that
<AdamTheDuck> [Alpha]: But I will say this. Fluttershy dragon mod for SKYRIM!
<Thrackerzod> and mw3 is a shit game
<eleanorawesome> Oh shush
<Jmo4267> mfw you say GT5 for Xbox. wat.
<d3rb> im talking ps3
<Jmo4267> We're talking Xbox.
<Jim> I have a PS3
<d3rb> chat is now ps3 discusion!
<Thrackerzod> Really tell me one thing that your ps3 or xbox can do that my pc cant?
<Jim> Thrackerzod, Get a Red Ring of Death
<diddutz> Eli: official Hasbro games?
*Bronysith licks Phase4
<Thrackerzod> Jim bingo
<eleanorawesome> A PC does not have Marvel vs capcom3, bayonetta, naruto games, and a tons of other titles
<Jmo4267> Love you Jim.
<Thrackerzod> yes it dose
<fluffle> 3DS max?
<[Alpha]> Alright if you are gonna go there let me start. I never stated that I thought the console could do or does just as much as a PC where you pulled that out I have no Idea but at this point it says you want to start a discussion or argument. I simply asked a question that I want a straightforward answer to.
<d3rb> Jim, overclock the shit out of the pc, = pc rrod, next
<Thrackerzod> if it dosent it will be made into it
<Eli> diddutz: not sure. but i think Fighting is magic will be on WiiU
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, o///o

<Jmo4267> hola Bronysith
<eleanorawesome> Background pony is awesome.

<Jim> http://i.imgur.com/9XKx3.jpg
*Bronysith glomps into Jim
*Jim hugs Bronysith
<AdamTheDuck> [Alpha]: Alright, firstly digital games are a lot cheaper than buying a solid copy and stuff... Some games include mods on PC... Some people prefer a mouse over those horrid joysticks... Pc's can be updated while consoles have release a new model...
<Thrackerzod> AdamTheDuck, let the pesant think he has some power, because you know xbox games where all wrought on a linx scrpit
<Thrackerzod> on a pc
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<Jmo4267> wrought
<Jmo4267> linx
<Wrek> 05atleast now you can see its becoming a pistol...
<Jmo4267> scrpit
<Wrek> 05so far so good
<Jmo4267> My eyes bleed.
<Thrackerzod> Wrek its all fun and games till polygons
<Thrackerzod> well more than about 30
<[Alpha]> Well that didn't anwer my question. I already knew all of that
<d3rb> what was the question again [Alpha] ?
<AdamTheDuck> [Alpha]: Oh that's right, you want to know why we think we're all high and mighty, not why Pc's are better than consoles >.<
<Jmo4267> Cause I have muffins and you don't.
*Bronysith licks Wrek
<pony1553> Sup guys
<AdamTheDuck> Hello pony1553
<d3rb> hello pony1553
<Jim> hi pony1553
<[Alpha]> I can see your point in all this but you goot distracted there
<Buytoast> oh man
<Buytoast> these user reviews
<Buytoast> this is some comedy gold
<d3rb> reviews of?
<Buytoast> Metroid Prime
<Jmo4267> Who? Where?
<Buytoast> some guy gave it a 0/10 becuase halo was better
<Jmo4267> I will shank him.
<d3rb> lol
<Jim> .-.
<pony1553> Halo is full campers
<AdamTheDuck> pony1553: It's not camping, it's tactical positioning
<Jmo4267> Halo is full of children.
<[Alpha]> Well it seems to me I did my own research. You no longer need to answer my question, but I'll be fine being called a "peasant" for playing a console my whole life ever since I was 5
<Buytoast> lets see what other people have to say about other games
<Buytoast> someone give me something
<AdamTheDuck> Buytoast: ArmA?
<Wrek> 05oh well
<Wrek> 05time to play something
<Bronysith> Wrek: are you prepared?
<Buytoast> ArmA II?
<[Alpha]> Honestly in review for video games there is a lot of morons out there
<Chrysalis> ooh incoming game
<Jmo4267> Chrysalis: You missed all the fun.
<Chrysalis> oh?
<pony1553> Incoming Tactical Game!!
<Chrysalis> what have i missed
<Bronysith> WHO ELSE is getting dark souls pc edition?
<Jmo4267> <-- I am
<Jmo4267> Can't wait :3
<Buytoast> some guy didn't like ArmA because he couldn't get past the training segment
<[Alpha]> I want it so yeah
<Bronysith> im going to role pyromancer
<Bronysith> or knight
<Buytoast> so he gave it a 0/10
<d3rb> i think he may be trolling or very very stupid Buytoast
<[Alpha]> or both
<Buytoast> another one gave it 0/10 because it was too hard
<Jim> Not sure if trolling, or very very stupid
<Bronysith> wat?
<Bronysith> ughhhhhhhhhhhh
<pony1553> *facehoof*
<d3rb> they should play some nes games if they wanna see hard
<Bronysith> why do people complain about difficulty? THATS THE FUN IN THE GAME
<Jim> uuuh, Age of Mythology?
<Jim> idk
<Buytoast> 0/10 becuase the AI people insulted him
<Bronysith> Jim: are you prepared for dark souls?
<Buytoast> that's a new one
<Jim> Bronysith, I don't know
<[Alpha]> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/36idb0/ for you Buytoast and those reviewers
<Bronysith> Jim: yes yes you are
<pinkyspice> o-o
<Serenity> Oh, is Wrek ready to piss off Caeser
<Buytoast> garbage meme crap, they probably eat it up
<Buytoast> lets see
<pinkyspice> what game is that?
<Buytoast> any other games?
<AdamTheDuck> Buytoast: Lol this is why I play ArmA, to laugh at those who can't.
<pinkyspice> It looks familar
<pony1553> This game remindds me of Stronghold
<Serenity> I wish I had a better GPU
<pinkyspice> is that age of empires?
<[Alpha]> I feel hated
<Jim> It is not AoE
<Franek12354> I have this game but forgoten the name
<Serenity> I can piss arma, Proccessor wise and RAM wise
<Jim> I would recognize that, but I do not recognize this
<Serenity> But my GPU has only got 396 mb
<Buytoast> oh man, i wonder what people have to say about psychonauts
<d3rb> 396? what an odd number
<Serenity> It's an Intel GMA x4500
<Jmo4267> o_O
<Serenity> Unfortunately, Integrated
<d3rb> laptop i assume?
<Serenity> Yep
<Jmo4267> lollaptop
<Serenity> Do you really think El shitbox would have a card like that?
*Jmo4267 hugs Serenity
<Serenity> El shitbox has got a Radeon HD 2400 which has 256 Mb
<Serenity> Slightly crapper than the GMA x4500
<Jim> I have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560M
<Buytoast> 3/10 for psychonauts because it's an overhyped platformer that people only like because they hopped on the bandwagon
<Serenity> It may be dedicated, but it HATES shadows
<Thrackerzod> I have whatever ATI rexently shit out
<Buytoast> this is spectacular
<Serenity> I presume a 6000 series ATI
<Serenity> Mine's an ATI 2000 series
<d3rb> 7000 is latest ati series
<Buytoast> what's this now?
<Serenity> My step brother has a freaking 4gb GPU
<Jmo4267> Which card Serenity?
<Serenity> It's a Nvidea
<Jmo4267> 590 or 690?
<Serenity> I can't remember the model number
<Jmo4267> or an older one?
<Jmo4267> Bollocks
<Jim> Think mine is 1536 Mb
<Thrackerzod> I have 16gb or ram, and a 4 core processor, with the most recent ati, i have to check the name
<Serenity> It's the Nvidia Geforce GTX 690
<Jmo4267> Richy rich..
<Serenity> I can presume
<d3rb> Thrackerzod, nice
<Serenity> It's top of the list
<Thrackerzod> im not rich i buildt it for 400$
<Serenity> My laptop has 4gb
<Serenity> El shitbox has 512 mb :3
<Jmo4267> Not talking to you Thrackerzod
<[Alpha]> Okay I now understand why pc gaming is better. Sorry if I cause trouble earlier snd I might still get a controller for the PC as I am used to that.
<Thrackerzod> oh
<[Alpha]> and
<Jmo4267> Talking to Serenity about his brother and his 690.
<d3rb> really easy to build a beast comp for cheap these days, especially if your in the U.S
<Thrackerzod> d3rb yup
<Serenity> Yeah, as you guessed, my step brother is one rich bastard
<Thrackerzod> spare parts are easy to get
<Serenity> Because he works at professional photography and 3d modelling, he earns a fare share of cash
<Jmo4267> That'd explain that.
<[Alpha]> Something I need to do as well supe up this computer
<d3rb> and leaps in speed has slowed down so my 3 year old pc which was high end at the time still works very nicely
<Thrackerzod> piff i earn $14 per hour
<Thrackerzod> im poor XD
<Thrackerzod> but i still have a god pc
<[Alpha]> I used to earn 4 dollars an hour
<Jmo4267> 'god' pc. huehuehue
<d3rb> all hail the god pc!
<Jmo4267> I'd rather not.
<Jim> American wages oh my
<Jim> so low
<[Alpha]> I'm fine
<d3rb> jim, but everything is cheaper in the us so it balances out
<Jim> true
<AdamTheDuck> [Alpha]: holy... In Austrlia the average for a teenager is $9-$10 an hour...
<d3rb> i'm on $19 but australia is so damn expensive thats a garbage wage
<Jmo4267> Austrlia.
<AdamTheDuck> Australia*
<Jmo4267> ;D
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<pinkyspice> so what game is this?
<Jmo4267> MS Paint.
<AdamTheDuck> Caesar III I think
<pony1553> Lol
<Jim> I have $31 if I work during day time and 41$ if I have night shifts
<[Alpha]> I got payed in tips I was a bus boy and I later found out that they were supposed to pay me by the hour plus tips. I only got tips
<AdamTheDuck> Why is Twilight taking up half the stream?
<Jmo4267> Staring into your soul.
<pony1553> :P
<d3rb> because pony
<Jim> [Alpha], Didn't you sign a work agreement before you accepted the job?
<pinkyspice> could be a doubble screen
<Jim> AdamTheDuck, Guess the game can't be fullscreened
<pinkyspice> and the left is a blank screen
<[Alpha]> No they basically just randomly hired me. I did sign a tax form though
<Jim> It's always a good idea to sort out wages and such before you actualy start in the job
<Jim> and make sure that it's written, not vocal
<AdamTheDuck> Jim: But the other day Wrek was streaming the game in full
<Jmo4267> ^
<Jim> AdamTheDuck, Guess he just forgot to change the area the stream views then
<[Alpha]> I don't work fo rthem anymore so it doesn't matter. I gave them my 2 weeks notice and 2 days later they found a replacemnt
<Jim> He could like zoom in on it with his stream tool
<ACS13123|Gmod> God Gmod is fun
<Jim> It is indeed!
*[Alpha] realizes that his typing sucks
<Jim> Wanna play online ACS13123|Gmod ?
<[Alpha]> ]/me still a noob to pc gaming so has no clue what is going on
<ACS13123|Gmod> Jim: Sure, aslong as its not TTT, it seems to bug me out completely
<Jmo4267> Naww Lil' Jim wants a pwaymate. ;D
<pony1553> I wonder if any of you have Stronghold
<Jim> What's TTT?
<allponiesarebestpony> hey everypony

*Jmo4267 hugs pinkyspice
<[Alpha]> I don't even know why I am downloading Cinema 4D when it says it's not ffor novices it is for professionals
<d3rb> [Alpha], jump into the deep end and be a pro
<pinkyspice> Jmo4267: my computer been fubar since bestbuy "repaired it"
<Jim> ACS13123|Gmod, You know what, I don't really feel like playing, sorry
<Jmo4267> lolbestbuy
<Jmo4267> Burn it with fire.
<d3rb> then burn those ashes
<pinkyspice> Jmo4267: It used to be able to handle skyrim =_=
<ACS13123|Gmod> Jim: Awww... thats ok, Im just messing around tryin to get some decent screenshots anyway...
<Jmo4267> Aw.
<d3rb> pinkyspice, format it and start from scratch
<[Alpha]> I have one small issue though. When I get bored os something it is dead to me
<[Alpha]> of
<pinkyspice> Jmo4267: now when I try to play it, just horrible delay in response
<pinkyspice> d3rb: I did
<Jmo4267> Seems like BestBuy did something wrong.
<d3rb> oh....wow, what the hell did they do?
<pinkyspice> d3rb: They had removed the harddrive, i had to format it
<Jmo4267> What did they 'repair' exactly?
<pinkyspice> d3rb: I told them to check the harddrive and the disk drive bcause i was worred it was damaged, they just replaced the harddrive and disk drive instead
<pinkyspice> and the second time the disk drive was fubar and didn't want to read half my disk
<pinkyspice> took it again with complains
<pinkyspice> they just replaced the disk and harddrive once more
<Jmo4267> BestBuy method of repair: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5712/
<[Alpha]> Oh well I'm going to do what bronies here said to do in Cenima 4d. I'm going to make a ball :P
<pony1553> lol

<pinkyspice> and find all the software this laptop had online
<Jmo4267> Oh laptop.
<pinkyspice> it used to recommend skyrim high, now it recommeds medium

<Bronysith> WOOT i got power armor in Fallout 1
<Barbetos|Quakecon> I was awake during a nightmare XD
<Jmo4267> Nice Bronysith, pat on the back for you.

<pony_9SupremePony> i am watching ballad of brony
<Jmo4267> 1997 old [Alpha]
<Barbetos|Quakecon> For some odd reason I thought my friend as slinder man. I jumped out of bed and threw my covers at him while screaming at the top of my lungs apparently (I don't remember doing it)
<Saturn> 08,01shana: <3
<Barbetos|Quakecon> slender8
<Jmo4267> Wow Barbetos|Quakecon.

<Barbetos|Quakecon> Anyways. When I woke up all I did said was, "Oh. Hey."
<Reme-not-Rome> Barbetosl Qukecon: oh god
<Barbetos|Quakecon> Then I went back to sleep
<Petrified_Discord> [Alpha]: http://derpy.me/FylY7
<Barbetos|Quakecon> But still though, I am surprised no one came to our room to make sure that some one did not get murdered.
<[Alpha]> Thank you :)
<Barbetos|Quakecon> Now I'll never find room mates again XD
<Barbetos|Quakecon> Damn daymares.

<cratorkid> Jim: no hats? do they horde them and not wear them? or do they just scrap them? or trade them?
<Jim> I have no idea but the whole idea of not wearing hats seems silly to me
<cratorkid> Jim: i would think they would be praised , if they dont wear the hats then they can trade them away almost freelt
<cratorkid> so more hats in the market
<[Alpha]> ...?
<Jim> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m66jmy2Pxk1qgn4fd.png this was from the TF2 website

<HoodyNinja> I had one of those ideas which seems like a good idea until you try it
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: In some sense yes, But this is more alot more individual management, Cause you gotta keep alot of things to be successful
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: I see
<cratorkid> in the new sim city , can you still have all the disasters?
<HoodyNinja> I played sim city at my friends once, i screwed his game over this tornadoes
<Jmo4267> You champion.
*HoodyNinja bows

<Jmo4267> ^
<cratorkid> HoodyNinja: wonder why he didn do that himself
<Shooeie> Would anyone like to know fun facts?
<Jmo4267> Shoot Shooeie
<HoodyNinja> I would if they truly entertain me
<MadSurge> It's not like the game ever "ends", right?
<Jmo4267> It's 12:01AM and I'm bored, anything entertains me at a time like this.
<Shooeie> Did you know that one of the Power Rangers was an MMA fighter?

*Jmo4267 slaps MadSurge
<Shooeie> Did you know that while Celestia has to raise only one Sun, Luna has to raise both the Moon and 50 billion stars as well.
*MadSurge passes out
<TheMonstaMuffin> Back!
<Xaiden|Okari> Shooeie YOU DON"T SAY
<Rain> Shooeie, she doesnt raise the stars. they are always there. she only raises the moon to take the place of the sun

<Cypresswolf> Shooeie: A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in the lobby discussing their recent tournament victories. After an hour, the manager came out of the office and asked them to disperse. "But why?" they asked, as they moved off. "Because," he said, "I can't stand chess nuts boasting in an open foyer."
<Jmo4267> >_>
<SirGanjalf> My turn: A pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel hanging from his belt. The bartender asks, "What's that for?" The pirate responds, "Aarrr, its driving me nuts".

"One of them has six goats and the other has four pigs and they all live in the room with us.

<Silverscreen> 01,11And really, I don't think they'd attempt to fix it if they DID know. Why ruin a concept that encourges people to attempt to "buy" your products more?
<Jmo4267> Morning ToxicPeanut
<Dken2021> oh wait ,nvm
<Jmo4267> Touche Silverscreen.
<Jmo4267> Question is, is there decent soda in the machine?

<Wrek> 05but at RANDUM
<Silverscreen> 01,11Pepsi products, including Mt. Dew, Code Red, and Cherry Coke.
<Jmo4267> Meh.

<[Alpha]> Shut Up PEPSI
<ToxicPeanut> PEPSI IS FOR BABIES (imagine that in Heavys voice)
<Jmo4267> And it begins.
<Wrek> 05screw that, Trocadero wins it all
<killerpony7733> Jmo4267: I drink both from time to time, Cause idunno both has something about them i like :)
<Silverscreen> 01,11Coke is more flavorful and has Dr. Pepper. Pepsi is healthier and has the Mt. Dew series. So I like both.
<Jake> Fritz Kola is best
<sub06905> Cream soda FTW
<ToxicPeanut> DR. PEPPER
<Jmo4267> Same killerpony7733.
<Shooeie> Dr. Pepper is preffered here
<Jmo4267> My favourite drink is V though. Tasty.
<AJIsAwesome> Root beer.
<Dken2021> sub06905 aww yea cream soda /)
<[Alpha]> I was just kidding. You wanna know why? I don't drink soda
<Bronysith> Shooeie: dr pepper, some fried shrimp and chips are good stuff

<Dken2021> the beverage I prefer more is .... oh god I forgot what I used to get at starbucks :(
<[Alpha]> It's funny my mother will buy me a meal and get me a large sprite and I'll look at her then she realizes i don't drink soda. I give the soda to my little brother or sister
<NullRadix> Mr Pibb is the Coke product, Dr Pepper is pepsi i believe
<ToxicPeanut> So much soda talk...

<Bronysith> Jmo4267: it is an excellent game
<pony1553> What game is this/

<lowfn> In FO3 I was able to play past the main story with the Broken Steel DLC
<Silverscreen> 01,11I actuallh have mods for both games that let me kill children. Why? Because in the gaming world, I can be a sadistic bastard son of satan.
<Jmo4267> LOL^
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: i can kill kids in FO1
*sub06905 has never played fallout
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: without the mods
<ToxicPeanut> Ah silver :3
<Silverscreen> 01,11I know.
<lowfn> Why doesnt Bethesda allow you to kill children?
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: i am enjoying fallout 1 actually. pretty aweswome game
<Silverscreen> 01,11lowfn: mainly PR control
<killerpony7733> Cause people will get butthurt over it
<MadSurge> Silverscreen: I can be an asshole, but not for the sake of achievements :D
<Bronysith> lowfn: cause they dont want soccer moms to get butthurt
<Jmo4267> ^
<Jmo4267> Best response ever.
*lowfn remembers Derpy
<Silverscreen> 01,11It annoyed the f*ck out of me when I found out I couldn't fucking kill that advertising kid in Freeside...
<ToxicPeanut> true dat
<killerpony7733> Still if something is unkillable it breaks immersion hard
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: ikr?
<lowfn> Damn those soccer moms.....
<sub06905> lol
<MadSurge> Silverscreen: also being a bastard in multiplayer is better :D
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: yup

<Jmo4267> BB Gun4lyf.
<Silverscreen> 01,11I also use my energy rifle on Deathclaws and Legion. Anything else I just whip out the Cowboy Repeater and unload a couple of shells.
<lowfn> Tara Strong did a voice in the game: Batman Arkham City

<MadSurge> Shooeie: and Raven in Teen Titans :)
<Silverscreen> 01,11harley would totally be a brony
<ACS13123> Twilight as Harleey makes more sense
<lowfn> ACS13123: Because Harley slightly sounded like Twilight Sparkle (the voice)
<ACS13123> Harley*
<Jim> http://e621.net/post/show/175333 Harley Twilight
<[Omega]> but Twilight is a prostitute
<MadSurge> Raven and Twilight would totally get along

<[Omega]> :S
<Jake> Hallo Purple`Prose
<Jmo4267> Gold.
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: It's generally the rules not to link to a mature site
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: try out FO1 some time, it is good
<lowfn> Please tell me Jim 's link didnt just flood me with viruses
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: thought so
<pony1553> :P
<Jmo4267> It's also a rule to praise the Muffin.
<Silverscreen> 01,11It's interesting how my gaming preferences changed over the past few years. I used to be a big Nintendo person. Then Bioshock drew me in because of the horror genre, and because of that I got into story-driven FPS games. That's how I got into playing New Vegas, and because Skyrim's gameplay is the same, I got into that one as well...
<Lil_B> if its a SWF Pony picture on e621 you may find it on twentypercentcooler, it's by the same people
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: except new vegas is much better than skyrim ... to me taht is
<Jmo4267> Silverscreen: You have decent taste.
<MadSurge> ACS13123: but this game isn't all brown :D
<pony1553> wow
<sonicrainboomer259|b> YAY DOOM!!!
<Jmo4267> >_>
<MadSurge> sonicrainboomer259|b: nope, Marathon
<ACS13123> MadSurge: I haven't played this or quake so....
<Silverscreen> 01,11BronySith: I don't know, I like how Skyrim gives you the option of using more than basic weapons by including the magical attacks. And it's not all offense either, since you can equip yourself some good shields.
<Jake> I started with strategy and then 3PS got me into FPS
<sonicrainboomer259|b> oh.....YAY MARATHON!!!
<Jmo4267> Next you know it people will call this Wolfenstein. Then I'll murder that person.
<ACS13123> AKIMBO FTW!
<[Alpha]> Started with adventure games
<MadSurge> ACS13123: I just saw an LP of Quake, all levels are very brown :D
<Lil_B> this is obviously Noas Arc 3D
<Dken2021> you sure this isn't noah's ark adventure?
<Fl00tersh41> Jmo4267: Is this wolfenstein?
<Shooeie> Finally found a Tara Strong reference
<pony1553> I`m terrible at fps
<sonicrainboomer259|b> LAT'S WATCH SCOTT PILGRIM IN 47 MINUTES!!!

<Silverscreen> 01,11The first console I ever played was Sega's Kid-friendly system called the Pico...
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: yea..i like skyrim, i just feel like new vegas is better, i love the wasteland environment
<MadSurge> Lil_B: :D you're a champion
<Jake> oh right my first game was Zack McCracken
<ACS13123> Jmo4267: you mean... this ISNT wolfenstein? Damn....

<sergio_scriptor> Dken2021: it's like a main vein (sorry my bad spelling)
<Silverscreen> 01,11I don't. I don't mind them so long as they keep away from using it for porn.
<Fl00tersh41> Jake: They're basically furry fursuiters, no?
<Ingwaz> Jake: well... i think its funny when other people wear them so long as they dont take it oo seriously. and as Silverscreen said, no porn. but i probably wouldnt wear one myself
<Silverscreen> 01,11Like, I love those cute Applejack and Rainbow Dash fursuiters we see at almost every brony/furry con. They're well made and actually look like something a company would make.
<Ingwaz> agreed Silverscreen, and when derpy ran up during a panel at bronycon last year, that was funny

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> yes Kandarihu
<Noob709> Kandarihu: Back in the day of OpenGL FPS Dooms, you could not "scope" period!
<sergio_scriptor> Fun fact : the first FPS has a arcade game from the 70's named "Tank simulator" :)
<Ponies47> Moo ^.^
<Dark92Enigma> otakon you mean: Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2
<Jmo4267> Wolfenstein 3D or gtfo.

<Ghosties> 04I know Scott Pilgrim gets a lot of flak for being tailor made for hipsters, but whatever
<Saturn> 08,01Schocke: how?
<Thorn> 10 miles in every direction.
<Ghosties> 04I like the comic and the film, that's all that matters to me
<MadSurge> THE SEX BOB-OMB?! WHAT :O

*derpy_pony never played zelda

<DJVinylScratch101> :l
<Saturn> 08,01in this episode, Ghosties becomes a hipster
<Schocke> Saturn : by showing me how the universe works at your stream a long time ago
<Thorn> I LIKE THEM
<Ponies47> Hey Ghosties!
<pony1553> :|
<Thorn> DONT JUDGE ME
<DJVinylScratch101> wow... music quality is shit....
<Agrold> Worgeral: mlp episodes are shown after each of the movies
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I don't know...I don't like seeing Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim...he's better suited for knocking up high schoolers and being totally oblivious...guess he is suited for this part ><
<Saturn> 08,01but srsly, ilove this film
<Lil_B> Silverstick more like Sex Bob-Omb , like the Mario Enemie
<Azuredragon> They kinda suck, its a running joke in the comic

<Dken2021> I've been well, still looking for jobs, uncle is sorta helping
<Worgeral> oh
<Worgeral> shy never been on brony state
<CriticKitten> Saturn: Does he get the judgmental glasses and free Mac laptop that comes with that title?
<DJVinylScratch101> \m/(>..<)\m/

<ACS13123> awww
<Saturn> 08,01Schocke: hehehe, i bet there's a good story behind that
<ACS13123> :P
<Reikim> I don't like Michael Cera as Scott...he's just TOO awkward. Doesn't properly represent the Scott of the comics, if you ask me. But that's a personal opinion.
<DJVinylScratch101> 6_9
<Worgeral> O_O
<Ninjazz> That's good to hear. Hope that works out for you. :)
<Thorn> DAT FACW.
<Silverstick> 01,11Lil_B: Exactly...and it's spelled Bob-bomb
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: ha! there's no such thing as a "free" Mac laptop!
<Ghosties> 04Fun fact: The inspiration for the entire character of Scott Pilgrim came from Canadian indie rock band "Plumtree," from the song called "Scott Pilgrim" in the album "Predicts the Future" released in 1997.

Director Edgar Wrightsaid Scott was originally supposed to hold up a picture of Ramona from the comic book series, but felt the silly drawing Scott holds up was more comedic.
