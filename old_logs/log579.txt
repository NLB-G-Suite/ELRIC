<Derpdash> oh ok ekips
<PsychoticDoc> applejack096: this is the root of about 50% of rock and roll
<AJTheMightyGamer> applejack096: it's pink floyd, i have not heard any of there music, so that's kinda why i am not really intrested. but it sounds pretty chillax
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pink Floyd is great music.
<applejack096> Im a whovian as well as pegasister so i prefer Chamelian Circuit :)
<MadSurge> ^
<MadSurge> oops
<PsychoticDoc> AJTheMightyGamer: you should watch the wall, it gives you a whole new apreciation for this band

<applejack096> Wats up Superbrony64! Where you been at?
<Shutterfly> applejack096: where do you watch the episodes from? I've been trying to find them all over the interwebs but found nothing! T.T
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd stream a Tool concert, but it would get Not Safe For Stream pretty quick.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it's bound to start some flame wars.
<PsychoticDoc> im pretty open to anything from before 2004
<ekips> start a flame war, acquire popcorn
<dalekkahn> ekips: -5 to reputation
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: unfotunate, since it's a great band
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tool is from the 90s. They're still around as far as I know.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Great band. I don't agree with all of their messages, but they make great songs.
<applejack096> Hahaha Shutterfly! I watch them live! Never missed one episode in my life! My dad wanted me to NOT be a scardie cat so he stuck the cradle in front of the TV and stuck it on. Ever since then ive been hooked!
<PsychoticDoc> started in the 90's= before 2004 for me
<SuperBrony64> 11,02applejack096: Been chilling :P

<applejack096> Shutterfly: Eeeyup! I live in England :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The video to Stinkfist creeped me out when I first watched it. In fact, I didn't finish it.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Today's manufactured pop?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nothing wrong with making money. It's just ruining the art in the process that irritates me.
<MadSurge> ...I'll see you on the dark side of the moon!
<PsychoticDoc> how is that, one direction get a cold?
<Shutterfly> Let's just face it, nothing is origonal anymore. Its hard to come across a form of entertainment today that people put their heart and soul into.

<PsychoticDoc> nop
<Shutterfly> applejack096: oh no....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just that you can see where there is less love in the product.

*PsychoticDoc burst into laughter over the seriousness of a 12 yr old's releationshhip
<applejack096> AJ for a 12yr old thats long btw

*PsychoticDoc orgasms in thy trousers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd like to hear a proper version of Welcome to the Machine.
<AJTheMightyGamer> .......
<Fishy> We're just two lost souls swimmin in a fish bowl
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: might be my favorite song fom them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Same Maidsurge.
<PsychoticDoc> year after year
<Shutterfly> now i'm thinking of my gf.... :)
<Fishy> and what have we found?
<AttacktheAndalite> Nittany_Discord: Florence and the Machine is pretty good for an indie artist
<MadSurge> Shutterfly: is she a nice girl?
<PsychoticDoc> same old fears.....
<AJTheMightyGamer> you too Shutterfly ?
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: agreed
<Shutterfly> MadSurge: oh she's great! So happy i'm with her!
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: I love her voice. So powerful and no auto-tune or fake at all
<Shutterfly> and no, AJTheMightyGamer, we're still together.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01For some reason, one of the Pink Floyd artists decided to add vocal backing to Welcome to the Machine, which ruined the song.
<AJTheMightyGamer> Shutterfly: well that's good. keep your love strong and trust and stuff.
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: no autotune is already 5000+ points for me
<Shutterfly> AJTheMightyGamer: I plan to. The only downside of us being together is that she's 15 going on 16 in Nov, and I'm 18. But hey, love has no boundaries, right?
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: Need more artists like her
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: Have you heard her new album that came out like a month or two ago?
<PsychoticDoc> Shutterfly: for me yes, 13 and under
<alexxm> best concert ever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's Friday, Friday. My hand is a dolphin!
<AJTheMightyGamer> Shutterfly: amen brother, I wish my ex's mom thought of that but sadly not. but yes love has no boundaries!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01wants a girlfriend

<linx> who's concert is this?
<Shutterfly> Don't worry, Nittany_Discord, I'm sure you'll find somepony :)
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: to be honest I only heard Cosmic Love, but that's so amazing already by itself!
<PsychoticDoc> Nittany_Discord: i know that feel
<Chrysalis> poor Nittany
<Vordox> OKAY!
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: same .__.
<Vordox> GUYS!
<Vordox> IQ math test
<MadSurge> :O
<Vordox> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4840184_700b_v1.jpg <--- what is this
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: Listen to the rest of the album Lungs and then listen to Ceremonials.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All the girls I like don't seem interested in me. Hard to tell.
<SirGanjalf> Comfortably Numb<3
<PsychoticDoc> relax...
<PsychoticDoc> needs some info first
<Shutterfly> Vordox: 2
*CriticKitten gave up on that whole thing.
<PsychoticDoc> just the baic facts
<Fishy> Saw this in concert with roger waters
<AJTheMightyGamer> Shutterfly: apparently her mom did not like the idea of me going out with her daughter. so in short she told her to break up with me. now she is going out with this one kid who his whole familly is bad news
<Vordox> Shutterfly: You sure it's not 288?
<PsychoticDoc> can you show mer where it hurts
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Either part has never shown any interest for me, For all the time so far
<Ponies47> back
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Vordox: 2.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: You've been in this position before? :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did that in my head.
<Shutterfly> vordox: positive
<Vordox> Some say 2, some say 288
<MadSurge> Vordox: why? O__o
<SirGanjalf> 288
<AJTheMightyGamer> Shutterfly: it did not help that i was mexican and the mom is racist. i am not just saying that to say, she is racist
<Vordox> MadSurge: It's based on a very famous math issue
<Vordox> Some say 288 and some say 2.
<Chrysalis> yup that is 2
<applejack096> I texted my Ex Bf
<Vordox> It's just a "Left to right" or "PEMDAS" issue
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I see.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The way it's written creates confusion.
<AJTheMightyGamer> holy crap, since when did we start talking about math?
<Vordox> Yeah Nittany_Discord
<PsychoticDoc> applejack096: pfffffft like its worth the trouble
<Shutterfly> AJTheMightyGamer: I'm pretty sure that's how I would be right now if we didn't try and hide it at first. Her parents love me. The only thing that they don't like is our age difference, so we hang out as much as we can when they are both working or when she goes walking around town.
<Chrysalis> how does it create confusion? always follow BODMAS
<MadSurge> Vordox: Math and I always have been sworn enemies.
<Chrysalis> anyone that doesnt is wrong
<Vordox> Chrysalis: You mean PEMDAS?
<Chrysalis> no i mean BODMAS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some see it as 48/(2(9+3)). Some see it as (48/2)(9+3)
<Vordox> MadSurge: Math's easy as long as it's logical. :P
<SirGanjalf> Google also says 288
<Vordox> Yep Nittany_Discord
<Vordox> SirGanjalf: Google says 288?
<Vordox> WHAT?
<Vordox> I thought it was 2
<AJTheMightyGamer> Shutterfly: yep, same here bud. oh well, i dont need a gf yet
<applejack096> I told my ex bf that its ok cuz a much hotter boy asked me out a week ago ;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pi is exactly 3!
<Chrysalis> Brackets, powers Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction
<Shutterfly> but its 48 / 2(12)
<SirGanjalf> Vordox: Just type: 48/2(9+3)
<AJTheMightyGamer> MATHS!!! IT BURNS
<Vordox> SirGanjalf: Oh nono, do not use Calculator
<MadSurge> Vordox: that's the problem, I hate going by logic :D I like finding alternate ways to solve problems :D
<applejack096> Bye guys :)
<Vordox> MadSurge: Smarter choice :P
<AttacktheAndalite> PEMDAS: 9+3=12 12*2=48 48/12=2
<Zanon> *steals TticieMuffins *
<AJTheMightyGamer> bye applejack096 take care:)
<Vordox> Oo
<SirGanjalf> Vordox: I've used it just to confirm my calculations:P
<Chrysalis> pi = o..n 1/1 + 1 / 2 + 1/3 + ... 1/n-1 + 1 / n where n = infinity
<Vordox> Chrysalis: You're wrong
<Shutterfly> take care, applejack096!
<Vordox> It's Multiplicative BEFORE Division
<AttacktheAndalite> Vordox: I used PEMDAS
<PsychoticDoc> get out
<Eulshy> really is this still on?
<Fishy> blasphemer
<Chrysalis> multiplication, and addition/subtraction are actually equivelant
<SirGanjalf> but enough math for now: i'll just enjoy the song...
<Chrysalis> doesnt matter which way you do them
<sub06905> Math! :)
<Lil_B> Pi = 1,8 + suareroot from 1.8
<Vordox> But...
<Chrysalis> because a division can be written as a multiplaction
<Vordox> Chrysalis: You should have gotten 288 if you followed BMODAS
<PsychoticDoc> E=mc2
<Chrysalis> and a subtraction can be written as an addition
<Shutterfly> Uhm, guys.... school's been done with. Can we not have a math argument please? :$
<MadSurge> ^
<Chrysalis> BODMAS not BMODAS
<Chrysalis> Shutterfly school is never over
<Chrysalis> you stop learning
<Eulshy> gunna find sumting else to do then, i'll never get the point of music concerts
<Chrysalis> whats the point in carryiing on
<Eulshy> bye
<Ponies47> brb
<Vordox> Bye Eulshy
<PsychoticDoc> school never over? FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Shutterfly> take care, Eulshy!
<Vordox> XD But yeah Chrysalis The REAL answer is 2
<MadSurge> I was so happy when I was done with high school because that meant no more math :D
<Vordox> The fake answer is 288
<Fishy> We don't need no education
<Chrysalis> im gonna feel so old for saying this
<AJTheMightyGamer> ok, time to get all this gf bf talk out of my head. to tf2 i go! see ya everypony! :)
<Chrysalis> but seriously, enjoy education while you can
<Shutterfly> We don't need no forced control
<Chrysalis> cause youll never have it so easy again
<MadSurge> ^
<PsychoticDoc> for me its over when i get to collage, ima do psychology
<PsychoticDoc> Shutterfly: please look up the lyrics
<Chrysalis> i miss school
<Chrysalis> the lessons where easy
<PsychoticDoc> befroe i go arnold shwartzaneggar rage
<Chrysalis> and money was something mum and dad dealt with
<Chrysalis> striaght As with no revision
<Vordox> So....
<Vordox> The answer according to the internet is 288 while the answer from Mathe...logics? is 2.
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: we have to "grow up" sooner or later, right?
<Shutterfly> PsychoticDoc: I was right the first time, but I was always told wrong.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I loved school so much, I stayed in it through my 20s.
<Vordox> ....WHICH is true!? O.o
<Chrysalis> google math uses a stack based approach to math
<Chrysalis> where each calculation is done in order
<Chrysalis> rather than evaluating the actual equation
<PsychoticDoc> Shutterfly: me and fishy were right, we studied the songs+ went to the concert
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord IKR, i only just finisehd and im 22
<Fishy> It's true
<linx> let math be, it hibernates during summer
<Fishy> Trust us
<Shutterfly> PsychoticDoc: the only concert I've been to was for Train. Didn't care for it that much. But Boston and Huey Louis are coming to my town soon and I want to see them both!
<legacyofvrak> Hello everypon3
<Fishy> Boston?
<Fishy> Fuck yeah
<Vordox> Chrysalis: So you mena...Those who used internet to get answers...Get the wrong answer? :D
<linx> hi legacyofvrak
*PsychoticDoc crosses arms in crossed hammer fashion
<legacyofvrak> what's on?
<Vordox> HAHAHA I gotta remember this
<Shutterfly> Hell yeah, Fishy!
<Chrysalis> yup
<Ponies47> back
<Chrysalis> as with most things you get off the internet
<Chrysalis> treat with caution
<legacyofvrak> hi linx
<Chrysalis> google cheats to save resources
<PsychoticDoc> run liek hell guis
<Chrysalis> and wikipedia is a TERRIBLE place to get information from

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I strayed away from Wikipedia during my thesis.
<CriticKitten> No it's not. >_>
<linx> legacyofvrak: to answere you question there on about math
<Vordox> Wikipedia is pretty stable for most things
<Chrysalis> its not 100% though
<red_ony> RE..You guys lied to me...there is a beautiful world outside my flat!
<CriticKitten> That's a common lie told to you by teachers who don't want you to rely ONLY on Wiki.
<legacyofvrak> wut?
<SirGanjalf> What about this? http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=48%2F2%289%2B3%29
<Shutterfly> Wikipedia is usually the only place I can find info on something. and its really accurate.
<Chrysalis> and more and more education authorities are penalising the use of it
<SirGanjalf> But, again, there's also this: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=a%2Fb%28c%2Bd%29
<me> red_ony no, they didn't lied to me :3
<Chrysalis> Shutterfly then your not looking properly
<CriticKitten> Because they know if you say "Wiki is okay", that's all you're going to use.
<red_ony> me :)
*Nittany_Discord 11,01washes BaconMane's glorious bacon mane.
<Chrysalis> youll always get better results from a book than wiki
<CriticKitten> No, seriously, can we take the teacher's word on this? Wiki is not a bad source. XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wiki isn't bad.
<CriticKitten> It's just not the ONLY source you should use.
<Lil_B> red_ony did you check it? maybe your flat is surrounded by paintings
<Chrysalis> its community authored
<Vordox> Wikipedia has answers, but the answers are pre made, not something self made <--- This is the issue
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I'm not putting my trust in it.
<PsychoticDoc> Run, run run run run run run run run run run
<Chrysalis> it doesnt take much to find a page and change it
<Shutterfly> Chrysalis: I once did an essay on Madrid for my Spanish Class. The only things i could find besides Wiki were pages about touring Madrid. This was after about 2 hours or so.
<Chrysalis> a wiki is as reliable as the people who write it
<Chrysalis> and wikipedia lets ANYONE author it
<red_ony> Lil_B: It is really beautifl outside here...the rhine promenade is full of people who just enjoy the weather....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: They do fact checking and moderation.
<CriticKitten> Chrysalis: Wikipedia is the most reliable source of information on the internet. Period. Let's get that nonsensical lie out of the way right now.
<BaconMane> 0,5Dat ArcherJoe11
<Shutterfly> Wikipedia also gets checked to see if the info isn't complete bull.
<ArcherJoe11> Hi everypony. What's on stream
<Chrysalis> they react to changes
*ekips noms on BaconMane
<Chrysalis> they dont pre-screen
<CriticKitten> They have moderators who do fact checking on a regular basis. People who are paid to make sure it's accurate.
<Shutterfly> Pink Floyd, ArcherJoe11
<Chrysalis> so for a time anything can be made wrong
<ArcherJoe11> Sweet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: That is the thing.
<red_ony> please don'T get info from wikipedia form your papers...wikipedia isn't quotable....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi ArcherJoe11
<PsychoticDoc> you'd better run!!1
*ArcherJoe11 manhugs Nittany_Discord "Hi there"
<Lil_B> red_ony my village is empty... a void of humanity, i go on the street and see nobody XD
<PsychoticDoc> wikipedia is the info overlord
<Shutterfly> how are people italisizing their text? I don't see it anywhere.
<red_ony> Lil_B: :/ ...
*Fishy magic
*PsychoticDoc i dont know lol
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 /me
<CriticKitten> So yeah, as I said, it's a lie teachers tell you because they know if they say "yes, you can use Wiki", then you won't bother looking anywhere else. Which is where problems emerge. Wiki isn't good as your ONLY resource. It's a good base of reference though.
*PsychoticDoc snort snort
<MadSurge> Lil_B: that's my town in winter :D
<linx> red_ony: WHAT??? oh god no
<Shutterfly> gee, thanks guys lol
*me pets Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2

<BaconMane> 0,5bakin
<Fishy> bakin?
<Fishy> oh boi
<Shutterfly> bacon?
<PsychoticDoc> bakin.
<MadSurge> Shutterfly: type /me at the start of a sentence
<CriticKitten> It's extremely wise to use it as a starting point for your search, because the references on any particular entry will give you somewhere to go fact-checking and you can use THOSE sites as your quoted resources. :P
*PsychoticDoc DONT ITS A TRAP
<red_ony> I only use wikipedia to get an overview about a topic myself..then it's off to the library....
*Shutterfly oh..
*PsychoticDoc /me is for hipsters
*Fishy wait
<me> PsychoticDoc :<
*Fishy that means
*PsychoticDoc my chat is cursed
*Shutterfly nothing is for hipsters anymore...
<red_ony> Funnily enough I just read a newspaper article while sitting in the sun ..about wikipedia articles...and edit-wars...
*PsychoticDoc Shutterfly lies and blastmephy
<Fishy> things nobody knows about is
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: in short, it's great to start searching for information but not reliable to the point of quoting.
<Fishy> are
<Fishy> Wikipedia the documentary
<red_ony> red_ony: Apearently "Neoliberalismus" is one of German wikipedia's largest battlefields...
<linx> red_ony: i meant the wiki thing but my internets slow so it takes a while to post
<Shutterfly> PsychoticDoc and Fishy: Hipsters are so commonly known that basically everything they do becomes mainstream after a while.
<Ilchymis> The hipster paradox
*PsychoticDoc Shutterfly lies, they only move on to another source of underground, while the rest of the world discovers the origional source
<MadSurge> Shutterfly: real hipsters don't say they're hipsters :D
<Fishy> which is why they must move on after they drain the soul of whatever subject they have chosen with their dark gypsy magic
<MadSurge> Aww it's over! :(
<Shutterfly> just look at Gotye. That was really undergound before it hit the mainstream.
<Chrysalis> soon being hipster will become mainstream
<Chrysalis> and all will be well
<Shutterfly> *He
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hi Chrysalis
<alexxm> great concert
<Chrysalis> as they consume themselves and there kind
<Ilchymis> I bet hipsters like apple products even more now that Steve Jobbs is underground.
<PsychoticDoc> being mainstream will be the new hipster
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Hrafn> I was mainstream before it was cool!
<red_ony> ..
<Fishy> Yeah me too!
<PsychoticDoc> Hrafn: get out

<ArcherJoe11> WACKEN!!!
<derpy_pony> erm...yes...this one
<Alchemist> Wacken? didnt they refer this in the lord of the weed parody?
<BronyInstrumental> derpy_pony: and technically scince I like them, it kinda is
<ArcherJoe11> yes. It's a small village in the middle of Germany. But once a Year it becomes the centre of the Metalworls.
<ArcherJoe11> *Metalworld
<pyrocatboy> It keeps buffering!
<BronyInstrumental> if we're listening to metal, we should totally play some asking alexandria :)
<derpy_pony> I've seen a documentary about it. Every garage becomes a bar on these days. The neighbor villages are jealous
<derpy_pony> they get nothing of the profit
<red_ony> how did they come up with wacken? I guess there just was a lot of empty space to cheaply rent?
<ArcherJoe11> derpy_pony: The best thing is, even the seniors are listening to the music, while standing at the edge of the road.
<ArcherJoe11> red_ony: The Farmer that owns the land once rented it for a small Festival. After that it became bigger and bigger.
<derpy_pony> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacken_Open_Air it began as a small even for local bands in 1990

<BronyInstrumental> you don't day, swed?
<pyrocatboy> STOP BUFFERING!
<BronyInstrumental> pyrocatboy i think it's just you

<Very_Silly_Filly> Neither has he as far as I'm aware
<ShadowStep> also does everyone addess people directly often?
<Dovah> ShadowStep: yup
<BronyInstrumental> quite often, ShadowStep, but if you wanted it to be private open a PM
<ShadowStep> okay good to know thanks guys
<somepony_else> a friend of mine used to learn the organ. he even had the keys for a church in Lüneburg so he could practice. Sometimes, when there were boardgame nights in the Gemeindehaus, we and some guys wen't over to the church at night to listen to him playing.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have an electric organ in my house, so yeah :P
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly I'm thinking about Buying the full version of Synthesia to To Practice with my MIDIs
<somepony_else> btw: the theme from halloween sounds awesome when played on an organ
<BronyInstrumental> Very_Silly_Filly: i have 6 electric guitars and 3 amps in my house, so yeah :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ganons theme sounds epic on organ
<Very_Silly_Filly> BronyInstrumental: Pah, needs more guitars
<BronyInstrumental> also around 5 acoustic
<Very_Silly_Filly> I did have around 20 at one point, but about 7 of them were broken
<BronyInstrumental> and some random plastic one that i fuck around on

<Saturn> 08,01yes
<GilDash> This is Saturn. Of course it was. :D
<BronyInstrumental> oh :P
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn, was that supposed to be a double entendre?

<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Hello! What are you doing my side of the world? :D
<Lil_B> GilDash owsn a side of the world?
<GilDash> Lil_B: I didn't mean literally... :D
<Vordox> Wrek: Randomy stream question, Land of the Free?
<ArcherJoe11> It's nice to listen to good music while reading. Don't you all agree?
<killerpony7733> GilDash: Sssssh you could easily fool someone to believe that!
<Lil_B> Vordox is going wild
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I'll remember that for next time.
<Vordox> Lil_B: Nah I'm just uber bored.

<Saturn> 08,01BronyInstrumental: do electrics have any advantages over electro-acoustics?
<Saturn> 08,01apart from easier action
<Very_Silly_Filly> Vordox: How did you get that picture of me?
<Lil_B> Vordox this face XD
<Vordox> Very_Silly_Filly: You're Russian+
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn: not to my knowledge, only that they have colder pickups
<MadSurge> Vordox: got some things to sell ya, stranjah!
<GilDash> Vordox: Needs more guns to be accurate.
<Lunar_Brony> good afternoon everypony
<Saturn> 08,01BronyInstrumental: colder?
<Lil_B> hi Lunar_Brony
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh sorry, that's not me. I instantly presumed it was me because all the weapons
<Very_Silly_Filly> Seems about the amount I'd carry when I go shopping
<Saturn> 08,01as in need more amplification?
<AttacktheAndalite> Afternoon, Lunar_Brony
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn: sorry, habit. i meant that electrics are often not as amplified by amps as electro-acoustics
<BronyInstrumental> yeah, that
<Lunar_Brony> wut?
<Saturn> 08,01is that a good or a bad thing?
<Lunar_Brony> I'm lost
*Nittany_Discord 11,01's hand is a dolphin
<Lunar_Brony> ohai Nittany_Discord
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn: depends on how you play
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord because... why not...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Lunar_Brony
<Saturn> 08,01BronyInstrumental: well, i know nothing about guitars, so can you explain a bit more?
<somepony_else> hello Lunar_Brony
<pyrocatboy> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7cijokZTn1rzih8xo1_500.jpg
<Lunar_Brony> pyrocatboy oh gawd
<MadSurge> pyrocatboy: AAAHHHHH SHOOT IT
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn: sure. for example, Jeff Beck has an electro-acoustic guitar so it is really loud without him even needing to strum or pluck, he can just touch the strings
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn: on the other hand, someone like ME who strums extremely hard would use an electric, as it would be too loud too easily if we had hotter pickups
<AttacktheAndalite> pyrocatboy: All my NOe
<AttacktheAndalite> NOPE*
<Dark_Horst> ...wat?
<Lunar_Brony> the last instrument I played was a ukelele, and that was a disaster. I'm sticking to my singing
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<Saturn> 08,01i think i'd prefer an electro-acoustic, in that case
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn: glad i could be of assistance :)
<alexxm> i haven't played any instruments
<pyrocatboy> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7am3pwoRr1ql2603o1_500.jpg
<BronyInstrumental> and most people refer to them as semi-acoustic
<Kammerjunk> Do you believe in magic?
<Kammerjunk> ohokay
<Lunar_Brony> Kammerjunk depends on the magic
<Lunar_Brony> Friendship, yes
<Kammerjunk> Lunar_Brony: In a young girl's heart?
<Kammerjunk> How the music can free her whenever it starts.

<Lunar_Brony> Kammerjunk yeah, I have a 6-year-old sister
<Dark_Horst> ha. perkele
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cut your sister's heart out.
<Dark_Horst> that sounds cute^^
<Kammerjunk> And it's magic if the music is groovy. It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie.

<Lunar_Brony> Saturn I don't even know what that last part means . . .
<Kammerjunk> So I've been listening to Caravan Palace's "Clash" for the past some time. I can't figure out what the hell they're saying.
<Kammerjunk> Lunar_Brony: +m is when only mods can talk.
<Kammerjunk> ...And techies.
<Noble> like adult swim
<Lunar_Brony> oh

<Derpdash> O.o how long have we been watching concerts?

<Kammerjunk> Bit time.
<AttacktheAndalite> Since about noon for me
<Lunar_Brony> I'm trying to figure out who the buck is playing
<alexxm> this band is epic
<Vordox> This song.
<Lunar_Brony> that's not helpful
<Kammerjunk> I'm not a big metal-guy, really.
<Kammerjunk> I mean, I like it, sure, but I prefer old rock or something.
<Kammerjunk> Swing is cool, too.
<Vordox> OMG! <3 Humanity has chances(Shame it's in the poor industri where IQ is high.) http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4802312_460s.jpg
<alexxm> i don't really mind as long as it sounds good
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Do ho ho, that slaps me on the knee.
<Lunar_Brony> I like songs by ABBA and Electric Light Orchestra
<Vordox> LAWl
<Vordox> Dat yodle
<Kammerjunk> I would buy pizza from that place every time, no matter how terrible the pizza is.
<Lunar_Brony> I feel like ordering a pizza now, but I'm broke
<AttacktheAndalite> Me too.
<Lunar_Brony> spent the last of my cash on a Brony t-shirt
<Kammerjunk> I had pizza just 1½ hour ago.
<Kammerjunk> It was alright.
<Lunar_Brony> but it will be worth it http://mlpf.im/1bH
<alexxm> i had barbacue for dinner

<alexxm> russian song is best song
<red_ony> I haven't done so in 1,5 years...wish me luck

<alexxm> red_ony have fun
<Lunar_Brony> good luck red_ony
<red_ony> Lunar_Brony: I actually went out today already...read my nwespaper in the sun..

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hehe
<red_ony> afk
<Lunar_Brony> Very_Silly_Filly I've walked when it was a blazing 30C
<Lunar_Brony> *celsius
<Kammerjunk> I believe I might have the lyrics to SOME of Caravan Palace's "Clash", but god dammit, the lyrics in that song are hard to hear.
<Lunar_Brony> no sunburn, though
<Kammerjunk> It's Denmark-weather over here.
<alexxm> european metal is best metal
<Kammerjunk> It's kinda like UK weather, except it may shine some times, and there's less rain and just as many gloomy clouds.
<alexxm> well today was good Kammerjunk
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is Wrek asleep?
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, today wasn't that bad.
<alexxm> possibly
<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: He might've gone for a smoke or something.
<Kammerjunk> It's only half past 11 PM over there.
<Science_Brony> Wrek SCIENCE!!!!1!!
<Science_Brony> that could wake anypony up
<Kammerjunk> Also, dem desktop ponies. The artist and the scientist.
<Science_Brony> Kammerjunk Wrek's OC is on the left

<Kammerjunk> Asides from seeing it on his dA, it's clear by the drawing of Twiley.
<Wrek> 05this is the onyl oen that fits the short gap i have
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ahhh screw me
<Vordox> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4797080_460s.jpg *SALUTE*

<Lunar_Brony> ohai Wrek
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: Do you have a strange craving for brains at the moment?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kammerjunk: No, just cake and the vengence of shooting people in the face for no reason, THEN eating their brains
<RustyMeat> who dat?
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: Oh.
<Kammerjunk> Well, tally on, then!
<RustyMeat> oh nightwish
<Very_Silly_Filly> I shall!
<Wrek> 05needs more base
<Kammerjunk> It always does, though.
<RustyMeat> the bass is fine I feel
<Vordox> Wait Wrek...
<Kammerjunk> Rule of thumb: If you're able to ask if the bass is strong enough, it's not.
<Vordox> Which singer is this Wrek?
<RustyMeat> I think its traja
<alexxm> this band seems intresting
<RustyMeat> dat top hat
<Lunar_Brony> I'm going out for a walk. Seeya later everypony
<Kammerjunk> The singer's beard. He must be a Viking.
<alexxm> or a pirate
<Kammerjunk> Or a pirate, yes.
<RustyMeat> yes he is
<Kammerjunk> Or a viking pirate.
<Kammerjunk> Wait...
<RustyMeat> Viking are already pirates
<Kammerjunk> Yeah.
<RustyMeat> <.<
<Kammerjunk> So out of vikings, who themselves are pirates, this one is particularly pirate-y.
<Wrek> 05its anette Olsen
<Kammerjunk> The gal?
<Wrek> 05yeh
<TrixieMuffins> Bye Bye Tarja
<Zanon> *steals Wrek*
*Very_Silly_Filly is back with 6 pieces of toast
<alexxm> how you doing Very_Silly_Filly
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of toast, I need to get more of that. I made a Sandvich recently, and I need more toast for more Sandviches.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I feel weak, destroyed, hungry, other than that, I'm fine
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: Well, go eat some brains.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm eating brains on toast now
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Wrek> 05Zanon <3
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wrek: I've been here much much long enough to know where this is going >_>
<Zanon> *steals Very_Silly_Filly 's toast*
*Very_Silly_Filly shoots zanon in the face
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: I found a picture of his beard and I'm looking at it right now. He's definitely a viking.
<alexxm> ok Kammerjunk
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ummm
<Kammerjunk> I can tell because http://derpy.me/sQa3s
<TrixieMuffins> who ? Tuomas?
<Dark_Horst> yeah... traja was better
<Kammerjunk> No, Marco.
<Dark_Horst> *tarja
<Very_Silly_Filly> That's quite a clashing tache
<Zanon> I still have the toast
<Very_Silly_Filly> Zanon: You should be dead
<Very_Silly_Filly> I shot you in the face
<pyrocatboy> What did you guys think of Skyrim's Dawnguard expansion?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Then ate your brains and kidneys
<Kammerjunk> pyrocatboy: ...Is it out?
<legacyofvrak> Sorry... but I don't like this kind of rock :/
<Kammerjunk> I haven't been playing Skyrim the past week or so.
<Dark_Horst> dont have it. is it good?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Not played skinram in months
<Zanon> http://i128.photobucket.com/albums/p197/lzanon/MLP%20pics/00rafaelzanonphonias.png
<Zanon> theres always more than one zanon
<Dovah> Dawnguard is epic and its been out for a long time
<Kammerjunk> Oh. Is it a free DLC? I can't seem to find it when I search on Steam.
<Dovah> its a $20 DLC
<Dovah> Free? wtf you smokeing?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Around 14quid
<Kammerjunk> Dovah: I'm asking because I seached "Dawnguard" on Steam and found nothing.
<legacyofvrak> Dark_Horst: One of my friends (Manoso52 -has a youtube account-) told me that it is quite very good game, but hes bored about exploring the world, I would like it because its similar to Fallout 3
<pyrocatboy> But its worth it because you get crossbows.
<Kammerjunk> But it is on Steam, yes?
<legacyofvrak> yeah
<legacyofvrak> it is
<Kammerjunk> Curious.
<BronyInstrumental> hey guys
<Dark_Horst> legacyofvrak: skyrim is awesome for exploration, i can tell you that much. got it when it came out... but i'm a bit apprehensive about buying the addon
<legacyofvrak> Yo, BronyInstrumental
<Very_Silly_Filly> legacyofvrak: So it's not similar to Fallout Vegas?
<Kammerjunk> I really can't find it.
<pyrocatboy> I can't wait for Jesse Cox to play it.
<Dark_Horst> it would need to have a lot of content to motivate me to spend my money
<legacyofvrak> Dark_Horst: And thats why I like it :D... I loved soooo far Fallout 3 :D
<legacyofvrak> :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> I don't like it
<Very_Silly_Filly> When you hit lvl 50, you're invincible with daedric armour
<Zanon> best zanon ever http://notharam.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/wpid-1341087763880.jpg?w=640
<legacyofvrak> Very_Silly_Filly: Skyrim?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeh
<legacyofvrak> Very_Silly_Filly , Well, love and tolerate, then
<Very_Silly_Filly> Not in my books
<Very_Silly_Filly> I hate and disregard
<Kammerjunk> What do you people mean, "it's been out a long time"?
<legacyofvrak> lol, Im listening dubstep, and its fitting perfectly to the stream
<legacyofvrak> :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> What do you mean, you don't agree with me!? Do you know who you're dealing with!? *Pushes button and world explodes*
<MadSurge> I'm sorry to ask, but who's Zanon? *ignorant*
<Dovah> Very_Silly_Filly: late reply but level 50 deadric armor? fight a legendary dragon then say that
<Kammerjunk> Zanon is Zanon.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Dovah: Dunno, never really played it long enough
<legacyofvrak> Very_Silly_Filly: DO YOU SEE THIS BUTTON??? IM GONNA PRESS IT :TheLivingTombstone:
<Very_Silly_Filly> I hated it by level 34
<Zanon> I am zanon
<Dovah> Bad Very_Silly_Filly you are a Very Bad filly
<legacyofvrak> Zanon lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> No, I'm just expressing my opinion
<pyrocatboy> Dovah don't forget very silly.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I find Fallout a lot more phin
<Zanon> btw last drawing i link wrek did that
<Zanon> gotta give him the credits
<Kammerjunk> No, but really though, is the exact release date for Dawnguard on the PC even known?
<legacyofvrak> Came back because of the ponify addon in Google Chrome
<Kammerjunk> Because I wouldn't play a Bethesda game on a console if I was paid for it (Okay, that's probably a lie).
<Dovah> its ok to not like things but dont be a dick about the things you dont like ~ twilight sparkle
<legacyofvrak> Did I lost something?
<MadSurge> Zanon: thought that eyestyle looked familiar :D
<legacyofvrak> or miss
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: problem is, the controlls always get optimized for consoles and then feel sucky on the pc
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Best way to see that in action is look at Skyrim's UI.
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: while the pip boy in fallout actually was a petty cool idea, the skyrim interface makes me cry out in agony
<Kammerjunk> God, I love mods.
<Zanon> wrek totally r63'd my oc from a lil colt to a mare . everypony loved the pic so much i made a char of her XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> TBH, I'd rather play it on console than PC, mainly becuase it's consolised
<RustyMeat> Havnt people already cracked dawnguard for pc?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kammerjunk: Go marry Luna then
<Zanon> so that is phonias.
<Vordox> I have...no food... I'm dying here...
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: No, I meant mods. Modifications.
<Kammerjunk> For Skyrim.
<Dark_Horst> shittons of mods
<Kammerjunk> Skyrim updating is a day of dread for me and my mods.
<Dovah> tbh i think this discution about what is better fallout or skyrim is stupid because they are both great games but set in different universese therfor some things will be better than others in each game.
<Dark_Horst> good thing i dont have many mods. i once tried improved lighting, but my laptops cpu didnt agree with me
<pyrocatboy> I wonder if someone made a mod to bring the mythical backwards dragon back.
<Dark_Horst> the wat?
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: I once tried to improve everything. Skyrim still hates my guts.
<Dark_Horst> Dovah: i wasnt aweare we were comparing them
<Dark_Horst> Dovah: then again, i just jumped into the middle of this when my chatwindow loaded up
<Dovah> Dark_Horst: niether was I :P
<pyrocatboy> I wonder if someone made a mod to bring the mythical backwards dragon back.
<Dovah> pyrocatboy: Dat derpy dragon :P
<CrystalClear> ban dodgers
<Kammerjunk> Dovah: To take that a bit further, I don't even compare FO3 to New Vegas. I think both are equally great, just that New Vegas is different.
<Dark_Horst> well, there'S mods to replace dragons with luttershys
<Dark_Horst> more terrifying than you would think
<Dark_Horst> i see it like this: fallout 3 had all the athmosphere, new vegas all the content
<Dovah> god I hate my internet connection I cant connect to xlive
<Kammerjunk> Great, now you people have given me Sons of Skyrim stuck in my head.
<Dovah> Kammerjunk: and thats a bad thing?
<Kammerjunk> Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, Naal Ok Zin Los Vahriin.

<Malmortius> SING IT WITH ME! Three months of winter coolness, and awesome holidays! We've kept our hoovseys warm at home, time off from work to play!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Applebloom: Likely Story
<Kammerjunk> If I don't play an Imperial in Skyrim, it basically goes like this: They tried to chop my goddamn head off. End of story.
<Dovah> Kammerjunk: Alduin saved you for that but you still kill him at the end whats the difference?
<Dovah> from*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Scoot-Scootaloo!
<Kammerjunk> Dovah: He's the final boss. I kinda have to.
<Malmortius> You guys dont know the lyrics to mlps winter wrap up?! :( Im so disappointed!
<Kammerjunk> Also, he's been raising quite a few dragons.
<Dovah> Kammerjunk: who says you have to do the main quest line? there is plenty of other things to do.
<Kammerjunk> Malmortius: 'Course I do. I had it stuck in my head for a month or two.
<alexxm> and destroying a few villages
<Kammerjunk> Dovah: Eventually, though, there's not.
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: And that.
<Dovah> Kammerjunk: eventually = 8 months
<pyrocatboy> Dovah I always found that hilarious. If he didn't attack to kill you, you would have died! XD
<Malmortius> Applejack/Rainbow dash has a really nice voice.
<Kammerjunk> Not at the rate I played it.
<Kammerjunk> (I totally "owned" the game with my first character, though)
<Dovah> pyrocatboy: ever have the glitch where he just flies around in circles and never lands on the tower?
<legacyofvrak> goodnight everyone :)
<pyrocatboy> Dovah nope.
<Kammerjunk> Night, legacyofvrak.

<Saturn> 08,01earth ponies are best ponies
<Dovah> pyrocatboy: no
<Kammerjunk> Dovah: That's how you play the game, then.
<Kammerjunk> Me, it was my first character. Story time is fun.

<EggWhite> Timberwolfs are best pony!
<Kammerjunk> The fandom.
<Dovah> NickThePegasus: fan made names
<NickThePegasus> oh thanks ^^
<Kammerjunk> NickThePegasus: Originally fanon names, anyway. All of them, with the possible exception of Lyra, have become official AFAIK.
<Kammerjunk> Or has 'Tavi become canon?
<pyrocatboy> Dovah: Its nhis word for when people are like "OOH YOU HAVE TO PICK THAT ITEM UP! YOU DIDN'T PICK IT UP! YOUR THE WORST SKYRIM PLAYER EVER!"
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Lyra was one of the first ones to be put on the toy
<alexxm> Kammerjunk technically lyra is official now she just has a last name as well
<Kammerjunk> XAX: I thought her name on the toy was Heartstrings.

<RAWRity> bonjour
<CriticKitten> People are sloooooow.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Why hello there, RAWRity
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: what are people being stupid about today?
<Kammerjunk> God, I hate bugs.
<Kammerjunk> Except for spiders. Spiders are cool.
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: spiders aren't technically bugs
<Kammerjunk> Fair enough.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kammerjunk: Spiders aren't even insects :p
<Kammerjunk> Yay spiders!
<Zanon> can i post a pic of the spiders where i live XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> Spiders because of their 8 legged frame, they fall into the arachnid group of organisms
<Kammerjunk> I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded cool.
<Eddmario> What're we watching?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Speaking of "bugs" as you easterns call them, I have a "bug"ger on my moniter now which I'm gonna shoot with a flamethrower
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka unicorns and vivi are best ponies :3 /)
*Very_Silly_Filly is so funny
<Dark_Horst> and dont forget to brush your teeth
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: Oh my. You have a bugger? As long as it doesn't bugger you.
<Vordox> JÄGER<3
<Very_Silly_Filly> It is, and I'm gonna blow it's brains out
<Kammerjunk> Ooh! RAWRity, is Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas an A film or B film?
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: hmm, gimme a moment
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> BTW l4d2 5 bucks again no excuse now !
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pah, I bought it in '10
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: bugger (noun): vulgar. A contemptible or pitied pony, typically a stallion.
<Eddmario> Meh, I've got the 360 version
<Kammerjunk> ...goddammitponify
<Kammerjunk> pitied person, typically a man*
<Very_Silly_Filly> Bugger: Generally a word the Europeans use in place of Damn, which originates from America
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: well, big name actors, made by a big studio, 18 mil budget, and a 7.7 on IMDB would suggest it's an A movie
<Very_Silly_Filly> :3
<Calcos323> Everyone ready for a double dose of Die Hard and Star Wars tonight?
<Very_Silly_Filly> If you see where I'm getting at
<Very_Silly_Filly> I wish my 3DS could run flash
<Eddmario> RAWRity: Would anime movies based on a series be considered B then?
<RAWRity> oh, and since we mentioned bugs earlier: http://socialmediaseo.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/giant-weta-insect.jpg
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'd totally watch the stream on that, then chat on my Piepod
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: Ha! Then I was right!
<Ingwaz> die hard? i thought it was robocop and star wars?
<RAWRity> Eddmario: depends on the budget/critical reception.
<Dovah> in 2 days time I shalt get off my lazy ass and stop procrastinating writting that fanfic.. well at least the next chapter :p
<Dark_Horst> RAWRity: aw, that'S cute

<Very_Silly_Filly> 'dat crotch grab
<Kandarihu> And since most Christmas movies are terrible and this one isn't, it's easy to think of this as at least one of the best Christmas movies of all time... especially since one wouldn't easily recognize it as a Christmas movie since it's not even marketed as such.
<Vordox> Did you all see that?
<SirGanjalf> Killing old man. In a church. During Christmas. Yep, those guys are DED
<Vordox> He breathe

<Kammerjunk> red_ony: We've had laws implemented for that for a while now in Denmark.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I see whee Moe got his line from the Simpsons now...
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, it was a nice time when airlines trusted passengers not to bring box-cutters and hijack airplanes.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Reporters are nosey fuckers who mostly deserve to be shot in the face with a 300 calibur sniper rifle

<StinkomanFan> Written by Sweetie Belle
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, indeed the dangerous nature of the objects doesn't make all the difference. The intent of the owner is more of a factor.

<Kandarihu> Then again, the main reason we went by car was because of the costs of tickets, not the heavy-handed security.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kandarihu: If you want through security, call me.,
<Very_Silly_Filly> Just make sure you buy me tickets
<SirGanjalf> troll

<RainbowCrashie> Hi
<Calcos323> Sumica: He's that boss
<NullRadix> Sumica: doesn't everyone?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: Come on, I keep a unloaded handcannon about.
<Kandarihu> But outside intercontinental travel, I wouldn't blame anyone for visiting a car rental instead of an airport for Thanksgiving and Christmas travel.
<XylemTube> I do!
<Sumica> 00,10hey it's the bare ass cop from nypd.
<Cypresswolf> Kandarihu: Driving is the way to go more often these days - I hate the airports, the pat downs, shoe checks, bag checks, metal detectors, and the things that arent allowed on the place even when I bought it in the area after those "securitys check points"
<RainbowCrashie> Omg flutter shy yay!
<StinkomanFan> YER THE ASSHOLE
<Calcos323> Yo, that dude was the captain from NYPD Blue

<JESmith> They should have sent lots of them like in Shadows of the Empire or Rouge Squadron
<Obsidian> Dat Stopmotion animation
<Pudge> video is seriously chugging
<Dken2021> Nittany_Discord because it would make sense?
<CriticKitten> Or maybe the ton-ton's saying "muppet muppet". Ton-tons are British?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: bc the Rebellion wasn't a legitimate threat before
<hen3ry> Nittany_Discord: all military budget was going towards Death Star construction
<Meanwhile> Personally I find Star Wars in general to be rather meh.

<Bronysith> Meanwhile: want to go for a millenium falcon ride?
<Vordox> Snow Beast? This is from that movie Pitch Black right?
<Ninjazz> I liked all of them, really, but I didn't see what was so awesome about it. Personally found Lotr alot more entertaining.
<otakon> Did you know Taun-Taun's are actually reptiles?
<hen3ry> the force will keep you safe from such... oh. oops.

<Lunar_Brony> Pudge good idea. I've got 4 other programs hogging my internet I should close
<red_ony> Kandarihu: Bout what? A Tab error?
<Reactor> Dken2021: That thing scared me when I was little
<JESmith> I'd go "Cookie" here, but seeing we're seeing Family Guy after this we should just save the FG parody quotes for when we're actually seeing it
<otakon> yeah lag is back
<Freefall29> otakon: sometimes its best NOT to know what its saying
<Pudge> Lunar_Brony: just closed skype and steam seems to be working better

<otakon> and he is awesome
<Ninjazz> Details, details.
<Kandarihu> red_ony, no. For not noticing your sarcasm about Bruce Willis being in the last movie.
<Ninjazz> it's a thing and it does a screetch.
<Lunar_Brony> Pudge thx for the suggestion. A bit smoother now
<Ninjazz> All that needs to be said about Chewy.
<Spectrum_Rush|> UST UST UST
<otakon> Ninjazz: no, he is Chewbacca and a mighty wookie!
<Freefall29> you want subtitles fine... *GROWL!!!*
<Dken2021> I sense some hostility in them two

<otakon> THAT NAME IS FAMILIAR!
<otakon> isn't Ord Mandell a old intergalactic space dump?
<Kandarihu> Yeah. Well, I should try harder to spot that.
<Ninjazz> Magic.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Ord Mandell is where you fight IG-88 in Shadows of the Empire
<Meanwhile> Und dann he arranged that.
<XylemTube> oh the drama
<hen3ry> Aside: Wookies are amazing in b.... nevermind.
<Pudge> burrrrrrn

<otakon> Freefall29: MADNESS!
<Freefall29> well i'm on IE atm and its perfect. I was using chrome yesterday and it was pure crap
<JESmith> Well Luke hadn't had his Jedi training yet, so maybe that's why it takes him forever

<Ninjazz> I'm ganna need to ask Luna then, huh?
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Naw. That gives Lucas too much credit, and he hasn't earned it. :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I bet it feels good in there.
<Obsidian> Dken2021: It was already dead
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> And i thought they smelled bad on the outside
<XylemTube> but i that it was fun
<Ninjazz> Since, you know... she found him and all.
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, true.
<Barbetos> They must smell good on the inside then.
<Dken2021> Obsidian still, that poor ton ton
<Pudge> Freefall29: haunted majora's mask is actually a convincing story
<Meanwhile> Gondor isn't a person damnit.
<ponibas> fung shuei the lungs!
<owloysius> it's bigger on the inside
<Luna> 07,01gonna ask me what?

<Freefall29> a story about a boy getting a haunted cartridge from a creepy old man off the streets.... crazy stuff happens... file corrputions... game talking to him.... all around ghost story... seems legit
<otakon> OtakuTom: well Slurry did say he was having issues at first too, I think mips doesn't like us is all.
<Pudge> Oh man I love this scene
<CriticKitten> Apparently the issues they were having with the speeders were an overnight fix
<Ninjazz> Damn...

<Freefall29> send in the pew pew cats
<Kandarihu> I think it's still looking good.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Yaaay...
<SirGanjalf> yay
<CriticKitten> Why not put the shield generator NEXT to the base so it's covered within the radius of the shield?
<Freefall29> yay
<XylemTube> War never changers... or dose it? The answer is no... unless it is yes...
<hen3ry> Just got here. Time to evacuate

<OtakuTom> Yea, my connection speed is fine. I'm getting 7.26 Mbps, which is more than I typically have on this connection.
<Lunar_Brony> JEWS IN SPAAAAAACCEE!!!!
<MASF123> i was only joking. :D
<Petrified_Discord> Pudge: Space channel is worse than buffer channel
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: maybe it cant cover itself, cause that would make an inverted shield or somth
<Thrackerzod> When we make intersteller ships i demand they are star destroyers WHO ELES IN AGREEMENT
<PinkiePieYoshi64> That's it, the Rebels are there, And I'm sure Pinkie Pie is with them >.>

<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Maybe, but then there's another solution. Build two. One inside the base radius, one outside. Shieldception, and the base stays safe.

*Bronysith digests Nittany_Discord
<Freefall29> darth vader being a jerk. that vid is funny
<Meanwhile> Lil_B: Meditation pod.
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: space toilet
<PinkiePieYoshi64> He dead
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat choke
<Thrackerzod> then porn
<XylemTube> you have failed me for the last time...
<Bronysith> Lil_B: meditation chamber. it is much more comfortable for him since he is pretty much limbless
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's a long reach.
<somepony_else> Lil_B: KinderÜberraschungsei ^^
<SirGanjalf> inb4 ded
<Canadian_Brony> my internet crashed
<Ryunosuke> suddenly field promotion
<Fisheh_Fish> ded

<PinkiePieYoshi64> As long as Vader can see you, you are DED
<XylemTube> so much ded
<Canadian_Brony> and Lunar_Brony is "taken"
<Spectrum_Rush|> Nittany_Discord: do not underestimate the power of the force
<Fou_Lou> somepony_else: lol
<StinkomanFan> I like those guy's costumes though
<Obsidian> Need a cleanup i=on Section 3.
<Ninjazz> How many of the people on the internet would LOVE to do that.
<SirGanjalf> Ded. Move along.
<Freefall29> implied execution
<Pudge> This scene is so great
<Barbetos> NEVER call that guy with bad news. Make your subordinates do it.
<hen3ry> Captain Piett had a much longer life expectency than Admiral Piett does, tho
<Calcos323> How did Robin Hood: Men in Tights start the "ded" meme?
<Dken2021> oh look, it's the other woman in the universe
<Kandarihu> Being able to forcechoke the people on TV. It would truely be a coveted power.
<twilight_sprinkle> i like dis scene
<DoctoDoctorWho> hello bronies, I am new to bronystate
<Fou_Lou> Barbetos: doesnt help
<Freefall29> Barbetos: but their under your command. so it still becomes your responsibility
<Thrackerzod> this battle is epic
<Shooeie> Why does this remind me of the Solar Empire vs the Lunar Republic
<Dken2021> lali-ho DoctoDoctorWho
<Fou_Lou> DoctoDoctorWho: weclome then ^-^

<Dken2021> lali-ho FillyFlam
<Barbetos> Hey. Welcome to bronystate DoctoDoctorWho.
<Lil_B> hi DoctoDoctorWho
<XylemTube> Dude it's a white sigil with pulse lasers
<Saturn> 08,01boob... laser?
*twilight_sprinkle cheers
<Saturn> 08,01i don't like the sound of this...
<Darf14> hello DoctoDoctorWho , welcome to Muffins!.... no wait Bronystate *facehoof*
<Freefall29> moonstone cannon.... fire!
<otakon> hen3ry: Ion Cannon, cuts through shields
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The first toilet has flushed.
<ponibas> saturn, family guy episode joke
<Pudge> wat?
<Calcos323> titguns
<otakon> Saturn: you'll see
<otakon> Calcos323: Mammary Cannons
<SirGanjalf> inb4 he ded
<Sumica> 00,10better idea, keep disabeling them with ion cannon shots till they fall out of orbit
<twilight_sprinkle> the calm before teh storm!
<hen3ry> Ions should be easier to shield against. Dat charge to mass ratio
<pony_7007> i remember playing this map on starwars battle 2
<XylemTube> dem assualt rifles
<Kammerjunk> Oh. This isn't those 3 additional Star Wars films I've been hearing rumors of, is there?
<Calcos323> otakon: Jug Blasters
<ponibas> thats a huge bitch!
<Obsidian> Hear that? Daks got this one guys.
<Kandarihu> Welcome to Bronystate, DoctoDoctorWho. Rules and FAQ. That stuff's important.
<otakon> You hear that! Dac can do it by himself!
<Canadian_Brony> this reminds me of Battlefront II
<Kammerjunk> I mean, there are still only 3, right?
<Darf14> we need a bigger gun
<Saturn> 08,01oooh
<pony_4152> ATAT <3 :D
<Barbetos> DoctoDoctorWho what Kandarihu said.
<otakon> Calcos323: Funbag Artillery
<Freefall29> brb
<Canadian_Brony> Darf14 I could make you a cannon out of Ductape
<SirGanjalf> dem AT-ATs
<Saturn> 08,01so *this* is where that pinkie pie thing came from in Anthology 2
<Thrackerzod> all terrrian sumthin suthin
<CriticKitten> Those are the most impractical anti-ground units ever designed.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Echo Station 5-7 we're on our way
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :D
<otakon> Saturn: you didn't know?
<ponibas> lol yep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good Ol Hoth Battle.
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: it might not disable it enough to make it fall
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn uh, yeah
<Lunchbox> Hey, it's every Star Wars video game ever.
<Fisheh_Fish> This should be fun
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i've never seen V and VI
<Lil_B> thats like WW1 Trail-Wars, Rebels are germany and Emperium are English with Tanks :P
<Darf14> Ductape Cannon? Deal! :)
<XylemTube> Star wars? looks a little like 2142
<Ninjazz> Attack paturn delta.
<Calcos323> otakon: Breast Projectiles
<otakon> CriticKitten: how so? they're heavily armed and armored and the four legs allow for a wide terrain usage.
<Saturn> 08,01i've only seen IV and I
<otakon> Calcos323: hmmmm... I'm out of ammo.
<Saturn> 08,01i've got all 6 of them on my hard drive
<hen3ry> the two legged varient, now THAT'S impractical
<Calcos323> XylemTube: That game was gdlk
<otakon> Saturn: WATCH THEM DAMMTI!
<Calcos323> otakon: VICTOLY
<otakon> hen3ry: agreed.
<Canadian_Brony> Darf14 if you can supply the ductape, I'll make it for you in a month
<Kandarihu> I fondly remember this mission in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron.
<Calcos323> otakon: Well played, good sir
<twilight_sprinkle> it aint strong enough for a lightsaber tho
<Sumica> 00,10sweep the leg
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, the ones we're streaming are the ones i supplied
<CriticKitten> otakon: A large patch of ice and they're down for the count. And they're much too tall. Heavily armored treads would be far superior.
<Thrackerzod> inb4 blaster kill
<Lil_B> somepony_else btw, is dearth Vade in every 7th egg? :3
<Saturn> 08,01but i've never gotten round to watching them
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Appljeeack?!!? AJ?!?!?! :O
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah but treads can't handle all terrains
<XylemTube> Calcos323: i never got t play it :(, meanwhile were getting BF4 instead of 2143 D:
<Calcos323> ded
<Saturn> 08,01and i missed half of this one because i'm meant to be working
<PinkiePieYoshi64> He's dead, Jim!
<sagas> gotta go repo an AT-AT
<twilight_sprinkle> well, hes fried
<Pudge> Applejack was a rogue? :O
<otakon> CriticKitten: four legs is better for stability and terrain usage overall
<mylilpwny> did he ded?
<CriticKitten> otakon: That's why you equip them with snow treads.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Sadly, she didn't make it :'(
<Ninjazz> Thinking on it, are those walkers even stratigically wise?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01AT-AT keeps on going.
<Calcos323> XylemTube: They want the CoD audience, and they aren't going to do that by being unique
<red_ony> legs are just silly
<Pudge> mylilpwny: he ded
<Darf14> Heres some Ductape made by ducks *gives 100 rolls of ductape*
<ponibas> i think the 4 legs woud bypass any "ice slippage" issues
<Ninjazz> Or are they just for eye-candy and looking baws?
<Canadian_Brony> pewpew pewpew
<GabeMoist> otakon, what about shorter legs
<somepony_else> of course, Lil_B ^^ well... at least if it isn't a happy hippo :D
<otakon> ponibas: especially with those giant flat feet
<Spectrum_Rush|> AT-AT dont give a fuck
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord they are powered by Duracell, they just keep on going...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Flying low there.
<ponibas> yeha
<SirGanjalf> One does not simply stop AT-AT.
<otakon> GabeMoist: eeyup but they want intimidation too
<Kandarihu> Duct Tape Cannons, HASSHA!
<otakon> THIS IS IT!
<ponibas> and slow speed
<Lunchbox> AT-AT's are largely for intimidation. The Empire builds their stuff to look boss.
<CriticKitten> >four legs prevent ice slippage
<XylemTube> theres the problem with a mech
<otakon> what Lunchbox
<twilight_sprinkle> i remember doing this in battlefield. solo.
<CriticKitten> >a simple metal tow cable can trip them up
<Dken2021> who knew a giant metal camel was so imtimidating?
<CriticKitten> Seems legit
<otakon> CriticKitten: but not trippoing
<red_ony> maybe they just should have gone with the wheeled design on this one...
<twilight_sprinkle> *battlefront
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat trip
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Mommy, I want an All Terrain Armored Transport for ma birthday :D
<Thrackerzod> watch the blaster kill
<Pudge> DED
<ponibas> legs don't move..
<Vordox> It NO EXPLODE
<red_ony> that is a pretty big weakness....
<somepony_else> booom
<Barbetos> How did that even blow it up?
<Ninjazz> Boom.
<Barbetos> Before it was a problem
<Major> Well how is it NOW they breach the armor???
<Dken2021> yay biggs and wedge
<GabeMoist> Armor weakened by fall?
<Kandarihu> Barbetos, they shot it.
<Barbetos> How is it being down going to make a difference!?
<CriticKitten> Major: Because plot convenience
*Eulshy Holds Knee, "Ahhhhh,,, feeeee, Ahhhh"
<XylemTube> What is it with the empire and big easilly exploited weaknesses?
<SirGanjalf> Head made of explodium
<Darf14> Gravity! There one weakness!
<Pudge> Barbetos: maybe the armor was weakened?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> They shot the neck, which was a weak point
<Ninjazz> Barbetos, they can't fly above it and shoot that spot.
<SirGanjalf> yay
<Pudge> They shot the weak point for massive damage
<Kandarihu> Yes, it makes no sense for it to be destroyed by one shot after falling. It's armor was friggin' intact!
<Barbetos> Pudge what was the point of tripping it then? =\
<Darf14> lol
<otakon> Pudge: armor behind the "head" is weakest and the neck is the vulnerable area.
<otakon> Barbetos: to keep them from moving
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did I see a Skype window fly by?
<DoctoDoctorWho> the only reason this battle went as bad as it did is cuz "attack pattern delta" means "Fly straight at them in the only direction their guns can actually hit us"
<CriticKitten> Dat AT-ST
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord I think so
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I did
<ponibas> nittany - no, figment of your imaginatio9n
<SirGanjalf> dat Snowtrooper
<CriticKitten> Chicken walker is best walker
<GabeMoist> CHICKEN WALKERS
<Pudge> otakon: I realized that shortly after typing
<twilight_sprinkle> boizzz
<CriticKitten> Scootawalker
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Rogue II!!!! :O
<Obsidian> Scootallo Walker is best walker
<Kandarihu> It just buffered for me again. Anyone else?
<otakon> DoctoDoctorWho: well that and main generator going down
<PinkiePieYoshi64> NOOO!!!!!
<otakon> Kandarihu: eeyup
<Barbetos> Pudge luke could of just used the force to make that shot, its not the first time he made an impossible shot that way. =P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nope.
<SirGanjalf> pew pew pew pew
<Lil_B> not my favourite character :(
<Kandarihu> Anyone that doesn't get a lot of buffering?
<Dken2021> not wedge
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Wait... wasn't Wedge Rogue II? Then who just got shot?
<Barbetos> Oh well. I dun like to over analyze so I am gona shut up now. Yay star wars!
<Canadian_Brony> GOIN' DOOOOWWWWNNN!!!
<Pudge> Barbetos: Maybe it takes a lot out of him at this point?
<otakon> PinkiePieYoshi64: Dac
<Lil_B> Kandarihu I have 0 buffering
<twilight_sprinkle> Wedge Antilles doesnt die iirc
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Ah ok
<ponibas> I've not gotten any buffering.. just the 2 video hiccups
<otakon> no, Biggs and Wedge survive ALL three movies
<Dovah> Saturn: not sure if My friend or I said thanks yet so thanks.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Biggs died...
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: and all the books ive read
<ponibas> Biggs bought it in the first one
<DoctoDoctorWho> They did this in tiberian sun too!
<Spectrum_Rush|> otakon: Biggs died
<hen3ry> Biggs was two days from retirement, too.
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush|: not yet!
<ponibas> Wdge is only non main to make it
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush|: he lived dammit
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: but yeah, biggs died in 4
<otakon> NO!
<Ryunosuke> RED SPY IS IN THE BASE
<otakon> NOT BIGGS!
<ponibas> lol
<otakon> NO DAMMIT NO!
<Spectrum_Rush|> otakon: he died in the Death Star trench
<Panda-Homework> ota ota otakon :D
<otakon> R.I.P. Biggs
<Calcos323> otakon: GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF, MAN
<Major> COWARDS!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I'm sorry to say Otakon, but Biggs died with Vader....
<Barbetos> lol!
<Ninjazz> And kicked.
<Darf14> Get me closer! I want to hit it with my lightsaber!
<otakon> hiya Panda-Homework what's up?
<ponibas> otakon, forst for night?
*Bronysith noms on otakon
<twilight_sprinkle> weeeeeeee
<ponibas> first*
<Barbetos> otakon keeeick
<Kandarihu> Now THIS is a weakspot
<twilight_sprinkle> kerzap!
<Bronysith> EPICNESSSSSSS
<red_ony> it's legolas everypony!
<Fisheh_Fish> Frag out
<Panda-Homework> otakon, nada :d just sayin hi... and wow you have been kicked 13 times today?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> What in the FUCK is?!!? BOOM!
<SirGanjalf> right in the 'nads
<otakon> yes it isn't a movie night without me getting kicked.
<Darf14> Lightsaber + Bomb = Massive Damage
<Dken2021> a massive weakspot
<Barbetos> Its the chats way of tyring to tell you not to be so hard on the keyboard otakon
<ponibas> it was pregnant!
<Fisheh_Fish> Boom
<otakon> Panda-Homework: no I just got on today that was once.
<twilight_sprinkle> Darf14: Wombo Combooo
<Lil_B> his head exploded from the epicness
<red_ony> noooooooooooooooooaaaa*smash*
<Barbetos> Hitting that enter key so much could break it
<Bronysith> EPIC
<Kandarihu> Did I just see an off-the-shelf explosion?
<hen3ry> Well to be fair, that's the easiest way to take out a tank. Open the hatch, use a grenade, GTFO.
<Freefall29> this battle means serious business
<Bronysith> SO MUCH EPIC
<Shooeie> Who design these things?
*Ninjazz pats otakon's back "Only you're qualified to take that much kicks and live, man."
<Pudge> otakon: how do you get kicked so much?
<CriticKitten> Yeah, I can see how walkers like this are totally superior to the low-to-ground snow tread units I suggested. >_>
<PinkiePieYoshi64> BOOM!!!
*Bronysith gives otakon a xanax
<Barbetos> Pudge he types to many messages to quickly
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Darth Vader, you are clear for landing :D
<otakon> Pudge: I "talk" too fast.
<CriticKitten> Two down, one from a HAND GRENADE. That's money well spent.
<SirGanjalf> My head would explode to, if i was hit in the balls with a lightsaber
<Lil_B> C3PO can run?
<Pudge> :D
<otakon> Lil_B: more like shuffle quickly
<ponibas> more of a fast waddle
<twilight_sprinkle> ATAT are probably chinese and dont cost much, they just spam em and win like now
*Spectrum_Rush| THE TAL SHIAR HAVE ENTERED THE BASE!
<Panda-Homework> otakon, hm... seems Sumica's kick counter is all time then :D
<hen3ry> Treaded vehicle would have same grenade vulnerability.
<SirGanjalf> :O
<Spectrum_Rush|> oh wait
<Major> HEIL VADER!
<SirGanjalf> DUN DUN DUN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Darth Vader has switch sides.
<Petrified_Discord> :O IT'S DARTH VAPOR! ...I mean Vader
<Darf14> AT AT is OP! NERF!
<CriticKitten> Snowtroopers: Like Stormtroopers, but with more KKK-like helmets
<Sumica> 00,10my what?
<DoctoDoctorWho> see the co-pilot? secretly he's singing the ants go marching
<Bronysith> There goes my apprentice
<Kandarihu> Dark Vapor
<Panda-Homework> Sumica, kick counter...
*Bronysith speed bags Sumica
<hen3ry> Hurry, before Vader realizes he built you, and uses his root password.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat engine stall cliche
<Calcos323> dat car sound
<SirGanjalf> It's Lord Helmet:O no, wait...
<Fisheh_Fish> Lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They shouldn't have worked on it.
<Lunchbox> Just like my car.
<OtakuTom> Okay, I don't want to jinx myself, but it looks like rebooting fixed my lag problem.
<twilight_sprinkle> so much sass on dis ship
<Pudge> incoming epicness
<ponibas> where was that on tatooine??
<Quick_Thinker> EAT LAZOR TIC TACS
<Darf14> Run AWAY!
<DoctoDoctorWho> shut him up or shut him down!
<Canadian_Brony> OtakuTom that would actually do well
<Thrackerzod> dat turrent
<twilight_sprinkle> curses, if only Vader could run
<Dken2021> ponibas perhaps too many civilians?
<Spectrum_Rush|> ponibas: he may have installed it later
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I got a heavy SUV that likes to break down a lot and his has a built in Gatling gun with two mini missles- I call it, the Millenium Falcon :D
*Bronysith gives Nittany_Discord rainbow dash nomming on muffins
<Quick_Thinker> nice
<Darf14> Almsot found the droids that there were looking for
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Rainbow Dash
<Fisheh_Fish> Nice PinkiePieYoshi64
<ponibas> Dken2021, no "innocent" civilians on that planet!! It's a hive of scum and villany!
<Barbetos> Remember in the force unleashed when vader could stop a ship using the force.... Yeah he has been getting lazy.
<DoctoDoctorWho> dat droid spazzing
<Canadian_Brony> Darf14 They are not the droids you are looking for.
<twilight_sprinkle> R2D2 is best space core
<otakon> Barbetos: he's getting old
<Ninjazz> Rainbow Dash doesn't nom on muffins...
<otakon> Barbetos: also that was Starkiller
*Major gives Nittany_Discord a Rainbow Dash feather duster
<Kandarihu> ponibas, so is the internet.
<otakon> Ninjazz: that's Derpy
<Dken2021> ponibas ah forgot
<Darf14> There not the droids im looking for 6_9
<hen3ry> R2D2: "Um, Luke, last movie, did we have hyperspace engines? I'm pretty sure that's a hax..."
<SirGanjalf> R2D2 is in spaaaaaaaaaaaaace!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01likes

<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: level 10 dwarfen armor surperior with 2 handed sword and shield 1 hand sword. all dwarfen
<otakon> and then another good scene
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Love this chase scene
<Pudge> spaaaaaaaaaace
<Darf14> DOH! >_<
<Quick_Thinker> how do you miss those
<Bronysith> otakon: good?
<Spectrum_Rush|> look at those maneuvers
<otakon> Bronysith: suddenly Skyrim?
<Ryunosuke> Drift lazily to the left!
<otakon> Bronysith: yeah good
<ponibas> yeah.. how did they not see that coming??
<Barbetos> otakon Pretty sure that Vader could do what Starkiller does. Vader gives him Starkiller a good run for his money on several occasions. Vader is just lazy.
<hen3ry> Imperial idiots.
<Dken2021> better use thos manuvers
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat Traffic jam
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Droids can act better than most actors these days

*Major cries due to Nittany_Discord swatting him
<Dken2021> seeya Freefall29
<ponibas> and to answer the question, TIE pilots prolly have tunnel vision on the target

<Obsidian> otakon: Lupa has
<hen3ry> thats my point. On, say, Titan, little gasmask would do it. The problem is just the air isn't breathable. On the asteroid Ceres, OTOH, your eyeballs would pop out
<Dken2021> 3PO, you're beind glass -_-
<Pudge> MASF123: I had to refresh my chat because my chat derped and it said there was a failed login

<Vordox> No Lil_B that was me too. :P I done all sprites except Vivi's walk cycle
<XylemTube> but the worm is in a vaccum Fisheh_Fish
<otakon> red_ony: space slug is just a giant mouth
<Barbetos> Hm. That would be cool. Get a Yoda back pack. Get it to play quotes. Feel like your really training as a Jedi.
<Lil_B> Vordox oh, wow :O
<otakon> also, Light Side is not neccessarily "good"
<oni_link> I want the originals on blu ray
<otakon> Barbetos: that would get me to excerices

<PinkiePieYoshi64> I knew I took too long
<ponibas> I have both, so my answer is irrelavent
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: the path of light is one of passive ness, i.e. not going in with weapons means no Vader would have shown up.

<Barbetos> Oh hai Everlasting_Joy.
<Bronami> Which pony is Han Solo?
<oni_link> darnit Vordox

<StinkomanFan> LANDO
<otakon> PinkiePieYoshi64: no AJ is Lando
<oni_link> Thrackerzod: hell yeah
<SirGanjalf> Nightmare Moon - Vader?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Alright, I'll take that :P
<otakon> JESmith: neat but a decent photoshopper could do it too
<Ponies47> JESmith: That's cool but sucks it costs monies :<
<otakon> SirGanjalf: I think so
<Dictonary> Hello everypony!

<CriticKitten> I have altered the deal!
<otakon> PinkiePieYoshi64: it's Spike It think
<kirzstryfe> if anyone needs me tonight, pm me directly, I'll be working on a picture and pretty much ignoring chat
<otakon> but he already SAID THAT!
<Vordox> VADER IS SO SPOILED! I would give him a butt smack :[
<Quick_Thinker> so what pony is lando?
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: AJ
<PinkiePieYoshi64> AJ
<Bronami> Han looks a litle tense
<Vordox> Quick_Thinker: AppleJack easily =P
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat music
<Thrackerzod> Vordox : Kinky
<Quick_Thinker> AJ but AJ is always honest
<otakon> Bronami: he needs to chill out.
<Vordox> Or Trixie!
<cratorkid> or spitfire
<CriticKitten> Notice here: he's using a blaster, NOT his lightsaber.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Memories of Shadows of the Empire <3
<Vordox> Trixie as Lando!
<SirGanjalf> Braeburn as Lando!
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: well true but RD and AJ are kind of friendly rivals so that works out there
<CriticKitten> I like the subtle symbolism there
<Bronami> I see what u did there
<Dken2021> oh, I guess Boba fett actually did something
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Braeburn (as Lando) Welcome to CLOOOOOUUDDDDDSCALE!
<JESmith> Otakon it wasn't an image or picture it was a little figurine of Solo but his face was replaced with yours
<otakon> Damn Boba taking pot shots
<otakon> PinkiePieYoshi64: Bespin
<Quick_Thinker> LUKE ITS A TRAP
<otakon> did anyone else see that?
<Bronysith> otakon: http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/demotivational-posters-all-the-compliments1.jpg
<oni_link> CriticKitten: care to elaborate on that?
<Sabershy> Luna?
<SlurryMoon> 3It's a Trap?
<Dken2021> see what?
<somepony_else> pew pew
<XylemTube> that blaster looks an awful lot like a luger
<oni_link> lol
<Vordox> IT'S A TRAP!
<Everlasting_Joy> Where's the admirable when you need him?
<hen3ry> see that's why I'd reverse it... AJ lives in the Clouds? AJ should be Han, with RD as Lando. :-P
<otakon> SlurryMoon: once again TOO SOON!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Quick_Thinker: Like some shadow passed by, right?
<Everlasting_Joy> *admiral
<otakon> hen3ry: that could work too
<otakon> and Big Mac could be Chewie!
<otakon> YES!
<Vordox> Admiral Ahkbar = Knows when it's a TRAP!
<Quick_Thinker> the hay?
<Dken2021> nope, even admiral ackbar is not amused by that
<PinkiePieYoshi64> That awkware yaaay....
<otakon> that would work right!
<hen3ry> Mac would be best Chewie.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Sabershy> otakon: Did you see images of Luna, too?
<Obsidian> dem pings
<Bronami> Anybody else here that yay
<StinkomanFan> What about Cheerilee?
<otakon> Big Mac as Chewie! A stallion of few word.
<Kandarihu> What's that ping sound anyway? Is it a Windows sound?
<Vordox> Damn you NGE. :D
<Luna> 07,01I see images of me all the time
<otakon> Sabershy: yeah I'm pretty sure I did.
<Luna> 07,01most of them are fanmade
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: this is my fav lightsaber duel
<Everlasting_Joy> I love this scene so much!
<otakon> Luna: but you ARE her..well kind of.
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Ditto.
<Ponies47> Luna is EVERYWHERE O_O
<CriticKitten> oni_link: You notice that he's still relying on a blaster, even though he's gained skill with the Force. It's a subtlety meant to highlight that he is still a rookie in the ways of the Jedi.
<Bronami> Awsome scene
<PinkiePieYoshi64> AJ as Lando, and Mac as Chewie... seems LEgit
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: so much emotion and great action too
<Dken2021> incoming boss battle!
<Ponies47> EVERYWHERE O_O
<XylemTube> I hate it when i get my schwartz twisted
<otakon> Luna: so good to see you, are you enjoying yourself dear?
<Quick_Thinker> this scene always sticked in my head i once was doing a test and suddenly i said out loud the FORCE IS WITH SKYWALKER XD
<SlurryMoon> 3oh man, it's this fight
<Bronami> Vaders geting pwned
<Luna> 07,01watching starwars :)

<Bronysith> SlurryMoon: best lightsaber duel
<Sabershy> @Luna: That was pretty clever... :$
<StinkomanFan> LEGO STAR WARS FLASH BACK
<otakon> RD DOWN IN FRONG!
<Dken2021> I saw that pic
<sonicandmario85> i saw rainbow dash at the bottum
<Raribot> I freakin love lightsabers. They need to be real.
<Bronysith> Luna: i love this movie.
<Ryunosuke> such emotion!
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Not to mention, the scenery complements it so well.
<SirGanjalf> "I see your schwartz is as big as mine."
<oni_link> CriticKitten: oh, thanks for that. now i know p,p
<Vordox> I like this Duel Fight style...
<otakon> Raribot: can't happen
<PinkiePieYoshi64> *whispers* I see screaming ponies....
<CriticKitten> oni_link: This becomes more apparent when you see the third movie, and he's not even carrying a blaster at all.
<XylemTube> Vader fighting Luke Once-handed
<Raribot> can too!
<Ryunosuke> also, Everyone loves Luna :)
<Ponies47> Bronysith: No (squee) you do :P
<Dken2021> Raribot but a simple swipe can cut off your limb
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope Wrek finishes my maid r63 OC soon. I want to make a big post of Maid Discord on my Tumblr.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: and the lack of music adds to the tenseness of the situation
<Thrackerzod> Raribot there impossible to make
<Vordox> No fucking jumping and doing EXTREME FRICKIG MOVES that waste TOO much time.
<Quick_Thinker> ITSS A DOUBLE CROSS
<Bronysith> Ponies47: stfu
<SirGanjalf> OH SNAP
<Ponies47> Bronysith: No (squee) you do :P
<Raribot> The word impossible means nothing to the determined.
<SirGanjalf> Trololando
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Agreed, in this regard.
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<XylemTube> Troll chewie
<Thrackerzod> XD
<otakon> Raribot: well not when SCIENCE says otherwise
<otakon> yeah Lando should be AJ
<SirGanjalf> Trust him! Trust him!
<Dken2021> please, trust he minority
<PinkiePieYoshi64> "I Knew all along: had to be a mistake!" <<< Best Threepio line xD
<otakon> SEE! TRUST HIM!
<Vordox> otakon: No, Trixi
<otakon> Vordox: no Trixie is Jabba
<noname> let him speak ffs
<Raribot> The driving force behind science can be argued to be determination.
<Raribot> Also, cookies.
<Vordox> Jabba is not Trixie. ._.
<Raribot> What are we talking about?
<SirGanjalf> racist 3PO
<otakon> Vordox: oh yes she is
<Saturn> 08,01trixie x jabba?

<StinkomanFan> otakon, Fatty Trixie? Me gusta
<Saturn> 08,01whut?
<Thrackerzod> bobba has best voice
<Vordox> Jabba should be wit someone that's insanely greedy.
<otakon> StinkomanFan: O_o
<Bronami> Which pony is Vadar exactly, Nightmare moon?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: i mean. luke is a novice at sword play, and you can tell. vader is just toying with luke the whole time and could strike him down anytime
<Vordox> Like Doughnut JOe
<Everlasting_Joy> StinkomanFan: :D
<Shooeie> Diamond Tiara as Jubba?
<CriticKitten> Jabba is Diamond Tiara.
<otakon> Vordox: well we got no greedy ponies
<Vordox> DIAMOND THE HUTT. :D
<otakon> Shooeie: that could work
<CriticKitten> For sure.
<SirGanjalf> Jabba - Blue Blood?
<hen3ry> Now picture that scene... Big Mac absolutely crushing Dash... and Rarity shrugging apoleptically - "He's only a farmhand"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nope.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Macintosh, they're right BEHIND YOU!!! :O

<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Wait, are you talking of the podrace, or the fight scenes ;).
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: IKR? he thinks that the prequel fights are better. i mean wtf
<Quick_Thinker> SO BUCKING COOOOOOLLLL

<Thrackerzod> then vader feels bad
<RocketBrony> derp.:P
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: they all sucked lol
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Everlasting_Joy with his softest feather duster.
*Everlasting_Joy is dusted :).
<XylemTube> but the prequel fight are much more well choreographed
<otakon> Everlasting_Joy: yes it is, why is choreographicy bad in star wars for Jedi fights but not lousy when it comes to the martial arts movies that helped inspired Jedi?
<Darf14> Luke Fights (LV23) Vader is LV90 .... RUN you fool!
*Bronysith gives Nittany_Discord s rainbow dash a hug
<otakon> Dammit R2 had a Critical Failure
<Quick_Thinker> this entire movie was made of pure concentrated win
<RocketBrony> who has heard of jontron or the movie birdemic?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> This is going to be John William's Epic Cue!
<otakon> but that happens when you plug into a power socket and NOT a interface.
<Pudge> RocketBrony: I watch jontron
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Right....
<RocketBrony> cool :)
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Now! :D :D :D :D

<Quick_Thinker> DOOR OPEN YOU BUCKET OF BOLTS
<Ponies47> JUST OPEN THE DOOR YOU STUIPED LUMP!
<Pudge> worst*
<Reactor> C3PO seems to have gotten more emotional in this movie
<Thrackerzod> how come there armor dosnet do shit why do they even wear it?
<Kandarihu> Around the beginning of One Piece, my favorite major battles were the ones where Usopp fought. Not because he's so strong but because he's so weak. It was amazing to see him transcend his cowardly self once every major arc.
<hen3ry> 3PO's emotion chip got turned to high.
<Saturn> 08,01yay no cgi
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: i mean. where was the emotional conflict between obi wan and maul? it was just dancing. very stupid
<Bronysith> Saturn: YES
<Quick_Thinker> BEST MOVIE IN MY OPINION OF ALL TIME
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon: Coreography isn't bad per se. What I don't like about the coreography of the prequals is, the difference between the prequals vs. the sequals is night and day.
<XylemTube> 3P0 got much more prissy
<Bronysith> Saturn: fuck cgi. it only worked in terminator 2
<berrygreyandbloodyte> hey guys oh sweet star wars
<SirGanjalf> "This is WHINIIING!"
<Ponies47> pew pew pew
<Pudge> otakon: it's worse than epic movie, so I doubt that will ever get picked
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: and Serenity
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Best Escape scene EVER :D
<otakon> Everlasting_Joy: yh bc it's the same universe but fundametally different movies
<StinkomanFan> LANDO
<oni_link> Bronysith: exactly
<RocketBrony> just 40 minutes into birdemic and we suddenly see birds dive bombing! thats normal.yep
<Bronysith> Saturn: i hate avatar. it was just pure cgi
<otakon> Pudge: if it's picked it'll go the way of the room.
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon: In that repsect, the consistancy is off then.
<oni_link> RocketBrony: :D
<Quick_Thinker> THIS SCENE IS SO FREAKING COOL LOOKING I WANT THIS ALSO IN MY ROOM :D

<Thrackerzod> GEE I WONDER WHATS GONNA HAPPEN HERE

<otakon> Everlasting_Joy: exactly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Suddenly Vader.
<Squallken> no one in 1980 was ready for this
<Kandarihu> Avatar is more like a CGI animated movie with live actors in it.
<Darf14> good thing that sneak attack failed
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Suddenly, an Antenna! :O
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: i saw phantom menace first. didnt know it was star wars. then i saw the OT and i was FUCKING BLOWN AWAY
<XylemTube> Vader is obviously letting him live
<SirGanjalf> Thrackerzod: duh, Good guy(Luke) will win, ofc
<CriticKitten> Vader's pushing him back easily. >_>
<SirGanjalf> NOT
<Bronysith> I LOVE THIS SCENE
<Pudge> ICONIC LINE COMING UP
<otakon> Everlasting_Joy: no one complained of fancy martial arts in goddamn KOTOR and that game was VERY faithful to the original source material.

<Alpha-Omega> if you notice throughout mass effect there is star war references
<cratorkid> and then everything changed when the fire nation attacked
<WalkerPony89> Bronysith: Even with ME3's shit ending, ME is still better than Star Wars hands down ;)
<Raribot> xD
<oni_link> PinkiePieYoshi64: And they were working on # 3 but the studio in charge is ded too
<Saturn> 08,01still a better love story than Twilight.
<cratorkid> ^
*Bronysith shoves a lightsaber in WalkerPony89 where the sun dont shine
<Dken2021> Also, Golbez is best Darth Vader
<Barbetos> I am just imagining the lyrics for this song as the word sumerpan said over and over again.
<Bronysith> Saturn: no shit
<Ponies47> Star Wars/Star Wars :P
<Raribot> That ending totally isn't canon. Bioware has lost their rights to their own canon.
<Quick_Thinker> still cannot beat KOTOR ending or for that matter the seguel
<oni_link> Barbetos: ikr
<Bronysith> Saturn: .... Bronysith x Bronysith s hand is a better love story than twilight
<Hec-3rm> Is this an intro or credits?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But the empire won in ME.
<Barbetos> oni_link not sure why though
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: i'd tap that.
<Thrackerzod> So whats next family guy pardoy?
<Bronysith> Quick_Thinker: kotor 1 is the best star wars game
<Dken2021> Hec-3rm: it's the ending credits
<Quick_Thinker> but KOTOR 2 is also good
*WalkerPony89 deflects Bronysith's lightsaber with his buns of steel and uses biotic slam on Bronysith
<Hec-3rm> k
<Lunar_Brony> Saturn any love story is better than "Twilight" (not to be confused with Twilight Sparkle)
<Kandarihu> Let's see here, if there's one video I'd like to suggest, I'll just msg it to SlurryMoon
<JESmith71> Yeah I think it's just Family Guy next
<Thrackerzod> Empire at war is 2nd best star wars game!!!
<oni_link> Barbetos: just because it was there and moving on beat :D
<Bronysith> WalkerPony89: lightsabers can cut through steel dumbshit
<Saturn> 08,01Lunar_Brony: i'd tap edward cullen
<Quick_Thinker> WRONG THRACKER ZOD
<SlurryMoon> 3I'm not taking suggestions today
<WalkerPony89> Bronysith: Not this steel! xD
<SlurryMoon> 3I'm too tired
<JESmith71> Slurry told me he's not feeling well tonight to run much else
*Dovah slaps Saturn
<Quick_Thinker> KOTOR AND KOTOR 2 are best ones
<Lunar_Brony> Saturn I have no clue what that means
<Alpha-Omega> I've read all of the twilight books
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Oni_Link SWBIII was indeed cancelled, but the people who took over (yes there were some who took over) stripped it all out, and so SWBII Became SWB Republic Commando, or whatever was the lasted Handheld release
<owloysius> Saturn: you mean robert patterson, right?
*Bronysith force implodes Quick_Thinker
<Ponies47> We're gonna be watching Somthing Somthing Somthing Dark Side and my brother is gonna watch it on TV! :D
<Reactor> I don't think I have ever seen a movie where the Empire is good.
<WalkerPony89> SlurryMoon: Family Guy Star Wars next I take it?

<Lunar_Brony> oh well
<Squallken> night everyone
<Pudge> Okay thank you SlurryMoon :)
<Quick_Thinker> KOTOR AND KOTOR 2 are best ones
<Saturn> 08,01Lunar_Brony: edward cullen is the vampire from twilight... honestly, if you've not read/seen it, you shouldn't deride it
<Lunar_Brony> better than G3, amiright?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Cheers for Star Wars :D
<Ponies47> SlurryMoon: Sounds good :3

<Saturn> 08,01okay, so PonyKart
<Vordox> I thought you took over the stream, Sumcia.
<WalkerPony89> Saturn: I wanted to hear that story too
<Lunar_Brony> The stream died?
<WalkerPony89> Yup
<Eddmario> Saturn: You were talking about a story involving THAT Lyra plushe
<Saturn> 08,01the guy e-mailed me back and was *demanding* financial information, and other stuff
<Saturn> 08,01so i passed him over to our treasurer
<Alpha-Omega> Aww no more talking?
<Saturn> 08,01who sent him a rather purple, but to-the-point e-mail saying that we wouldn't disclose our financial situation
<Polydunami|DW> Yeah :(
<Saturn> 08,01he then sent us this really really rude e-mail back
<Lunar_Brony> Alpha-Omega I'm still getting stream
<WalkerPony89> Lunar_Brony: Refresh
<Saturn> 08,01saying "zomg your e-mail was so pretentiious, i hope you convention is a shitfest, you're waht's wrong with this fandom"
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony: You're probably a few seconds behind
<Saturn> 08,01and it ended in "and by the way, i'm the person who made the lyra plushie!"
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Saturn> 08,01you know, thinking it would piss me off
<Polydunami|DW> Are we hearing another "Satowned" story? :3
<Saturn> 08,01and i'd be all irate and blargh about it
<Lunar_Brony> WalkerPony89 Eddmario my stream is usally behind. I jsut got the thing about the LYra plushie
<Shizuka> 13>"you're what's wrong with this fandom"
<Alpha-Omega> nice saturn
<WalkerPony89> Saturn: Yup, that's definetly a troll
<Vordox> Shizuka: ?

<WalkerPony89> Lunar_Brony: I know that feeo bro. Mine's never THAT far behind though
<Eddmario> Alright, who would have bought that plushie but NOT have used in sexually?
<SlurryMoon> 3night
<Major> Shizuka: pony logic, it doesnt have to make sense :P
<Saturn> 08,01my reply: "i think your plushie is one of the best things to happen to the fandom in a long time. here's why" and i linked him the imgur album of alternative uses for the plushie
<Vordox> Gnight Slur

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Works for me
<Spectrum_Rush|> Saturn: >_> <_< >_> *click*... *Saved*
<CriticKitten> Shizu: I've seen enough swimming pools to know where that's going.
<superretroworld> i dont even know why the lyra plushie was created in the first place?
<Ponies47> Saturn: You are amazing! If I ever meet you I am gonna hug you so hard!

<otakon> Shizuka: you don't talk though
<Shizuka> 13silly filly
<kirzstryfe> Shizuka-pony's skin tone is a good example, near impossible to color correctly with the background I'm working with, so everything is faded or visibility is off, and the black background is up
<Eddmario> Saturn: Now say "I'm the Doctor!"
<XAX_> Saturn: Random user calls kgo
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> I want to see Freaky The Snowman!

<kirzstryfe> Wrek does the same thing, but is a bit more subtle about it, he uses a background color that's close to opposite of the main color he works with
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Soul Eater!?
<DixInfernus> Skype name is actually the same.
<Eddmario> Do some Digimon!
<DeathStar> otakon: good and dancey
