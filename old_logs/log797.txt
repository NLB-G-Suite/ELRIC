<pants> ORPHAN
<pony_540> glack glack gak
<pony_300> this was definitely my favorite episode of the season. Luna is the anti-freddy kreuger
<DocSane> Luna is confirmed as best princess of all.
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Some times, they'll call in favors from outsiders like Sombra. That way, they can get some different material to watch.
<Zippoman924> me
<LooptyHoop> you can have a dream about luna. and there is a fake luna doing naughty things, and the real luna sees this, and will not be pleased
<CosmicLatte> It's Twilight Barkle
<pony_540> I GAKED SO HARD

<pony_587> Twidog
<Mintmaddog> Luna is so wise!
<PonySwagg> Luna Krueger is getting old already.

<OohShiny> OH, GOD! ALL THE FANFICS!
<pony_9102> She always was the best.
<Derpyshy> MEH
<pony_540> 2gaky
<pony_256> i hope someone uploaded this ep already
<Reikim> Luna having domain over the dreamlands, or at least a presence there, is now canon. Oh, the fics that will be possible now~
<PonySwagg> Luna reveals another power!
<Grissess> Luna was always best princess. Celestia is attention whore.
<Ninjazz> Welp. Best episode.
<Stemglass> so far this season: Bad Apple>Sleepless>Pinkies>Magic>Crystal
<DaDavis> lol
<PrincessRealta> LPS is #2 show
<RedRookieRebel> Mute the LPS
<Obsidian> The fanfics will explode
<Ashles> Luna is best princess <3
<Trollestia> LUNA'S VOICE: SO FUCKING AWESOME
<pants> LOL so much gak
<CurePony> Luna princess of the night & now the nightmare eater
<pony_5868> so if a pony has a perverted dream with Luna, it really happens lol
<Atzel> Luna is best fey
<Gligarman_> Good Girl Luna visits fillies and helps them get over their fears
<Chrysalis> i did like the scootaloo/rainbowdash character building
<Pillowfeather> Agreed
<KrazyNoobs> pony_256 yep, link on EQD
<RainbowDashSavior> SO. MUCH. FANFICS will arise from this.
<Picanteman> in soviet russia, chat spams you
<pony_pink> dat voice
<thelonepony> GlyphicStrike: naw, dont jump to conlcusion just yet
<babycreeper> wut is everyone with the stupid gak
<Cyclone_Dusk> Sadly the stream glitched in the beginning...
<Conyst> Luna was always best princess.
<Kurra> So.... this episode makes me want to go to bed on time :3
<Pillowfeather> the amount of fanfic
<Kimoyo> everynight marx every night
<Top> hehe too true :3
<mitamaking> tdijk: you know in your heart
<Crazyethan> goth and moth
<Fishpony> So does celestia invade daydreams?
<BlitzWing00> Luna taught a lesson
<PonyStationVita> scootaloo is best cmc member
<Pillowfeather> is going to be enormous
<PrincessRealta> # 1 is ponies
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: ergo the princesses are the ultimate bronies :D
<babycreeper> stahp
<Treble_clef> Scootafadh is cannon
<Cyclone_Dusk> so I missed pre-title-sequence
<CriticKitten> I'm actually sort of surprised though. It sounded like Luna's VA was changed again.
<Zippoman924> All it needed was some more Fluttershy and It would be best episode for me.
<artemis3120> I missed the intro, was it really depressing??
<Ashles> can't wait to see what people make <3
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Scootabuse canon.
<Mamoru> gak is sexy

<GAKisBACK> pony_pink - her tara strong voice?
<pony_256> XD
<pants> No thats ok Ill take another show
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> that was a great Birthday present
<pony_9102> "Perverted" is a relative term.
<Me_> How long before Freddy vs. Luna
*Kurra hugs errpony, this episode put him in a good spiffin' mood :3
<Pillowfeather> Again
<Reikim> It really isn't.
<CriticKitten> Wasn't the same tone as in Nightmare Night.
<Pillowfeather> I wanted answer
<pony_540> What the fuck are they talking about, SWEETIBELL WAS CARRYING A WHOLE GODDAMN HOUSE AROUND
<Cyclone_Dusk> I'm hearing echo.
<KrazyNoobs> Gak is gak
<gato> Uhhhh Didn't get to see the ending, but rpretty cool episode ;)
<Pillowfeather> Like, where scoot come from
<CosmicLatte> (\ :D
<Trollestia> Kurra: Cuz Luna
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Eeexatly.
<Pillowfeather> and everything
<Flutterssertive> I think luna has more screentime than celestia in season 3 so far...
<Nittany_Discord> Back to main.
<Hiro_> Sweetie Belle for abused a ton
<DaringDerpy> echo
<AJIsAwesome> I do hope we get an episode involving both princesses. It'd be nice to see how they act around eachother.
<Cyclone_Dusk> 10/10

<Mintmaddog> 10/10
<Gligarman_> Anyone saw Derpy? :C
<RainbowDashSavior> 10/10
<K1> It was pretty good
<Ponyko> Epic Episode
<Acronym> Luna/10
<Reikim> Hasbro gives no bucks about where Scoots came from.
<Parasprite_X> 2nd Best episode of S3.
<Picanteman> dagnhdahhdhhhdeahq
<Crane> Liked it
<lel> NOT A LPS STREAM
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> cya
<Conyst> All the feels
<sub06905> scootaloo <3
<Xlerb> and all that entails
<Picanteman> g
<Picanteman> g
<Cyclone_Dusk> whoops.
<Picanteman> g
<Picanteman> g
<MadSurge> Why?
<ThundercrackerMLP> I didn't think it was depressing, I thought it was awesome
<SaxyPretender> 0,14was pretty good ep, but the Luna stuff was shoehorned and the ending gives me a problem
<pony_9737> Scootaloo :D
<StupidSexyCJ> depressing? explain
<Picanteman> lel
<Grissess> ...
<RainbowDashSavior> @para whats the first? xD
<KrazyNoobs> g-j
<ThundercrackerMLP> she has a big sister now!
<Ninjazz> She did fly.
<Cyclone_Dusk> derp. I was listening to the stream too ^^
<BlueVanilla> no one still knows where she lives
<mitamaking> 3rd best episode of the season
<Stemglass> They are streaming live TV, new episode is over
<kristelsouthpark1> Why is it depressing?
<Rappafoin> Derpy was the elder pony
<Vordox> Orphan...
<Starlight_Phoenix> Scoots is an orphan?
<MadSurge> It wasn't depressing
<Kurra> Trollestia: more like 'cuz Dashie taking Scootaloo unner her wing AMMAGOSH squee c:
<OohShiny> Where does Scootaloo leaves, then?
<No0neSpecial> She has no sisters - that's canon now
<BlitzWing00> It was good, but too much time used up with Scootaloo running around.
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: Comedic cartoon jump?
<Vordox> Nah, I'm happy
<NullRadix> I'll go with Luna being there. Might have been a bit heavy. Interesting dream physics though
<Kurra> but also Loona ;D
<GameTaco> I kinda do want to see more Scootaluna now. The two most overlooked main ponies in the series.
<Trollestia> Kurra: BUT THE LUNA
<KrazyNoobs> 3rd best of Season 3, 6th best overall
<Ta_Dikin> I liked it
<Vordox> Do not let Scootaloo fly
<Themalachiteprototyp> she's trolling
<pants> Your hair is puffy
<lel> >not downloading the eps
<Jageman> Luna has solidified her position as my Best Pony.
<lel> HA
<pony_boat> I want her to fly
<Vinyl9291> lol
<pony_4908> That was Lauren Faust's plan.
<Iwa> SaxyPretender: What problem then? :o
<Phase4> 00,02Starlight_Phoenix, the fannon consensus is that she's an orphan
<Pillowfeather> Do y'all think they'll get their cutie marks?
<Luna> 07,01Goodbye everypony i'll see you SOON.
<LooptyHoop> no siblings doesn't mean you're an orphan
<Ninjazz> AJIsAwesome, sleepy glide. :D
<Mintmaddog> BUT LUNA!
<pants> LAg
<Pillowfeather> at some point?
<Top> Scoots desstiny is on the ground
<Tri333> we don't know that! it s like they want us to keep imagining things !
<cowvarkians> scoots is best orphan
<pony_boat> Don't care. She should fly
<Zippoman924> That is epic that Scootaloo is now under RD's wing
<Polydunami> Thanks Luna
<StupidSexyCJ> bai Luna
<KrazyNoobs> Bye Luna
<pony_9> LUNA <3
<Silence> See you!
<Deacon> seeya Luna
<VenHur> Bye Luna!
<DaringDerpy> bye Luna
<Hiro_> The CMC episode showed her hovering
<RainbowDashSavior> cya luna
<phood> sounds like trixie
<sub06905> bai Luna
*Luna 07,01returns to Canterlot
<Stellafera> I love that scootaloo is a cripple
<Angel> Maybe she's like Forrest Gump!
<CriticKitten> Bye Luna!
<Nagato198> Scootaloo always annoyed me, now she has to be one of my favourites :3
<AJIsAwesome> Scoots was supposed to be handicapped.
<Phase4> 00,02bye Luna
<Polydunami> This is a dream
<AlienWarhead> I'll see you soon Luna
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the whole RD isn't supposed to be a big sister model
<DaringDerpy> she will fly!
<Mintmaddog> bye Luna
*KrazyNoobs laughs
<kelzae> that's what lauren said.
<Conyst> bye Luna
<katanart> Anyone else think she sounded like Trixie?
<artemis3120> I think it's pretty obvious she's an orphan, but it's never gonna be explicit.
<Jmo> Toodles Luna, good to see you.
<Sliverfish> ERMAHGERD
<CallingCthulhu> Bloody hell, you guys love your GrimDerp.
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Scoots is best CMC forever
<CosmicLatte> No, she's Handi-CAPABLE.
<Mamoru> touch my gak ;)
<matttheshadowman> Rainbow + Scootaloo hugging = definite feels
<Graywolf71> LUNA IS BEST FREDDIE KRUGER
<pants> And now that she is gone
<Picanteman> im so horny
<Starlight_Phoenix> Scoots being crippled.....errr
<pony_9737> Bye Luna
<Cyclone_Dusk> I'm kind of amazed that Dashie being nurturing >_>
<Panda> wait... Luna?
<Gligarman_> oh god
<BlitzWing00> Cripple Pip
<Elastmus> wth
<pants> WE can allGAK
<OohShiny> the mlp game in the hub site there's scootaloo flying
<Stellafera> I like the subtle hinting at it
<pony_7212> Is the show gonna start again?
<Gligarman_> The soccer moms would just flip shit again
<GlyphicStrike> Better term: handicapped....
<Xlerb> true
<PonyStationVita> that would be horrible!
<BlueVanilla> I see something like a Meet the Robinsons on Scootaloo
<cap_word> "cripple" is a slur, lol
<lelouch_kagamine> Gak me like one of your gak girls
<AJIsAwesome> I think that'd be a great idea for an episode.
<Gligarman_> just like poor Derpy
<amatobrony> because we saw how well they handled a disability when they found out more about derpy :/
<pony_300> this episode had bite, like some of the best episodes of MLP. Also, Scootalo can't fly, but it would be cool if she eventually learned to fly
<K1> CMC needs their cutiemarks already!
<mitamaking> I mean are all Pegusi are orphans?
<AppleJake> Also. Sweete Belle was a terrible singer ,3,
<pony_4908> :/
<Kurra> Trollestia: the Luna indeed. Princess of night vision, raves, dreams, and the color dark blue!
<CriticKitten> Saxy: To be fair, they already broke her mold earlier in the series. The pet episode, remember?
<Picanteman> u want sum fuk?
<pony_5217> scootaloo and her friends could be slower with maturing
<SoundStream> WHERE IS DERPY
<cowvarkians> lots of crippled kids
<thewashout> like finding nemo 0.0
<pony_7212> I missed it D:
<Ninjazz> RIP Derpy.
<pony_4908> :|
<TrixieMuffin> Im awaiting the awesome remixes of sweetiebelle's song from this episode
<Trollestia> Kurra: BRO ALSO HER VOICE
<Pillowfeather> Agreend with amatobrony
<Wrek> 05thanks for tuning in today!
<viscourt2> the game is not cannon
<amatobrony> and now derpy is banned
<CallingCthulhu> Disfigured? Dahellman.
<Wrek> 05side rooms are now locked
<Pinkies4thWall> lel: it was 5 minutes ago.
<StupidSexyCJ> better ter: flight impaired
<SaxyPretender> 0,14true, but still, not totally okay with it
<pony_587> So make Scootaloo the shows morality pet/Tiny Tim?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: not dead! D:<
<Pillowfeather> She doesn't even come up in the background
<Pillowfeather> so sad
<Hugs|Shower> It would be hilarious if Scoots actually had parents, because then the fanon would just ultimately crumble
<pony_7848> when did "Lauren faust left the show"?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14was a good ep though
<matttheshadowman> Derpy is on holiday at the moment all calls are now taken by Lyra
<RedRookieRebel> I have mild CP
<Pillowfeather> I fear she's gone forever
<Elastmus> why do i hear ppl?
<mio> an watch new episode missed stream
<lel> I didn't even brake a rule
<Hugs|Shower> I admit, I would laugh at it
<prince-dari> Head back over to the main channel
<Redemption> Derpy = Best pony
<RainbowDashSavior> lol red...
<Kurra> Her voice is.... weird
<BronyfoREVerDrumming> in b4 scootaloo creepy pasta
<lel> Why was i kicked?
<amatobrony> i miss derpy :'(
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> A great tragedy.
<KrazyNoobs> gak?
<AJIsAwesome> Hugs|Shower: Not all of it.
<Xlerb> she is not helpless
<CriticKitten> I think it works here, honestly. I liked this ep so much more than the Trixie ep.
<pants> God this show is so ew
<GAKisBACK> GAK!
<Hugs|Shower> And it makes me a horrible person for saying so
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> At least we still have Colgate.
<Xlerb> she just cant fly
<tdijk> I think Scootaloo handicap will be revealed at the cutie mark episode at the end of the series, because it's inevitable at some point
<Pillowfeather> And Lyra
<AmethystStar> PINKIECORD
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: in the new season she will be everywhere :D
<pony_5689> yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
<TBi> I HOPE MEGATRON WINS
<Pillowfeather> And Bobon
<otakon> oh it is time again for the naughty and nice awards
<Paper> I mised the....
<VenHur> Maybe Luna must of hitted purbety.
<pony_269> not anymore, scooter is lost to the river!
<Pillowfeather> that are everywhere
<Top> yeah we havent seen Derpy in a while
<Kurra> I liked Luna's older voice better I think.
<Starlight_Phoenix> but Scoots can glide
<K1> Discord
<AJIsAwesome> Hugs|Shower: There are some Scoots fans that believe that she has parents.
<mio> where can watch new episode anyone know?
<Paper> FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<GAKisBACK> I loved this fucking episode - best one yet? YES!
<PonySwaggRevenge> REVENGE IS COMING
<otakon> no contest, Pinkie wins nicest
<VenHur> Maybe THAT why her voice was...off...
<MadSurge> ^ like me
<Top> Reikim wb Derpy?
<Stellafera> This episode was my second fav in the entire show after "Hurricane Fluttershy". SO MANY FEELS
<cap_word> Like scooting
<Trollestia> GAKisBACK: YUP
<Latios> derpy is dead
<Stemglass> I am surprised Smile Smile Smile isn't best song
*Jmo slaps prince-dari around a bit with a large trout
<pants> LETS GO VOTE YEAH
<Dark_Horst> who's the thoughtful sounding smoothvoice-guy?
<KrazyNoobs> I liked it, 9/10
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, dude, they edited her out of certain scenes. Although, I've read one thing that excites me to no end but so far it looks like she's axed for good.
<Elastmus> WHY DO I HEAR PEOPLE?
<JT> mio, give it a few hours and it'll be on Youtube
<amatobrony> #savederpy lol
<Reikim> What about me and Derpy?
<PonyStationVita> i never thought of that
<Vinyl9291> like riding the scooter for gods sake
<Tri333> scootaloo 's scoot is best scoot
<BlueVanilla> an episode on Derpy
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: They're all nice in their own ways. :)
<Nick> Why isnt there any gak or floam adds?
<cap_word> Derpy is a toaster cover now
<K1> I'm calling it! Season finale will have Sombra and Discord!
<lel> I need a reason for why i was kicked
<Stemglass> sor me it's between Burger Rain and Flim Flam song
<pony_boat> I'm hoping she can fly. A good episode would be realizing she'd be more like Fluttershy than RD
<matttheshadowman> it was Luna's dream voice
<GameTaco> "Got a PS3? Read a book, it's more fun."
<Picanteman> asdfghjkl
<Jigglysaint> oh god
<Tobiwan> http://derpibooru.org/images/175396 I called the whole dream thing
<Trollestia> DRAGON TALES? Well, yeah.
<Hugs|Shower> AJIsAwesome: True....it's sorta a thin line. Half believes she has parents, half believe she's an orphan
<OldenPony> derpy's had to hide for this season
<otakon> eeyup
<PrincessRealta> LPS isn't that bad. Not as good as ponies but better than Pound Puppies.
<PonySwaggRevenge> Anyways.
<Jigglysaint> Spike
<AmethystStar> I REMEMEBR THAT
<Nagato198> Celestia must really be annoyed, still no letters
<babycreeper> yeah
<pony47368> why isint the episode called scootaloos horror story
<AlienWarhead> ah Dragon tales
<PonyStationVita> omg i luv that show
<pony_4908> Andrea Libman was the girl on Dragon Tales! :D
<Vinyl9291> i forgot bout that
<PonySwaggRevenge> All the Luna.
<babycreeper> they do
<Jigglysaint> no wait that was the bully
<crazitaco> wow i used to LOVE dragon tails
<Sumica> 00,10Room is locked please ehad to #Bronystate
<KrazyNoobs> Dragon Tails... my childhood, i learned cartwheels because of it
<Hex> I remember this.
<RaveBrony> Well there was Tabitha overdose, so that was now my fav ep of S3
<Latios> maybe hasbro banned her
<GAKisBACK> BARNEY - that purple fucking dinosaur, was full of retards and cripples
<Stellafera> I prefer having Scootaloo not fl
<Trollestia> It's not on PBS anymore
<PonySwaggRevenge> And all the Luna is all the win.
<GAKisBACK> no offense
<DocSane> Lots of cartoons have had handicapped characters.
<Jmo> Dabi
<Jmo> pls
<Zippoman924> Was there a Derpy?
<Top> we havent seen her in ages is all
<PonyStationVita> lol me the only one talking
<VenHur> I remember that show...nowadays...I just facepalmed at the fact.
<Kandarihu> Lauren Faust's vision for Scootaloo was that she will never be able to fly and has to go through life accepting that. Problem is, there's no explanation as to why she can't fly. This comes across as less about disability and more about never wanting to learn how to fly.
<pony_5689> YABBA
<Polydunami> You know Magic School Bus? A recurring character is in a wheelchair.
<pony_5689> DABA
<RBDash> maybe in s4
<RedRookieRebel> Scoot is my favorite
<KrazyNoobs> GAKisBACK correct

<Pinkie> but that would end up being the cutie mark get episode .-.
<DocSane> It's kind of a stereotypical PC character to do.
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm.
<Pillowfeather> It would be epic if she doesn't apear throughout the whole season and then the last 20 seconds of the last episode, she just shows up and say something bad ass as fuck
<Hugs|Shower> Oh boy

<Stemglass> Build A Bear has a Rudolph plush you can buy who wears Slippers..of Rudolph's head!

<Elastmus> idk
<Flutterssertive> She chased down RD carrying a blimp!!!
<Stellafera> That episode was so emotional, seriously
<Conyst> hello PonyStationVita Xlerb
<RainbowDashSavior> yea why?
<sub06905> dat episode name
<PoniesFortress47> Poor RaveBrony
<KrazyNoobs> she did
<Tobiwan> http://derpibooru.org/images/175396
<Trollestia> SWEETIE BELLE BURST
<otakon> oh
<Xlerb> she had a spurt
<RaveBrony> Uuuuuuugh
<GAK> GAK GAK GAK
<Chrysalis> seriously, can you stop tom naming the ep
<AJIsAwesome> Well, the title obviously gives it away.
<pony_4908> She had the little "poof' moment earlier. :S
<Vinyl9291> we did alittle in the babs ep
<BlitzWing00> She almost did in Babs Seeds
<pony_269> i'm so excited i could just BURST!
<Obsidian> She's starting to
<Beatfox> she did in One Bad Apple
<RedRookieRebel> She is young
<Zedrin> Sweetie Burst
<Gligarman_> She produced some magic sparks in One bad Apple
<KrazyNoobs> gak
<GAKisBACK> krazynoob I just realized... That show was made for those people!
<pony_boat> And Scootaloo hovered
<otakon> Okay I love the new season so far
<Chrysalis> i didnt know anything bout the ep till then
<RaveBrony> I agree with, Chrysalis
<Dark_Horst> fluttershy is perfectly able to fly. she's just suffering from vertigo
<KrazyNoobs> THATS GAK
<BlitzWing00> Sparking Horn
<thewashout> she hasnt learned much "/
<PonySwaggRevenge> Okay seriously...
<GameTaco> And then Sweetie Belle exploded.
<RainbowDashSavior> Tobiwan are you a wizard?

<OohShiny> Fluttershy can fly - but she's afraid of heights
<Zeus> sweetebelle is strong as hell
<pants> Playdo is superirer to gak
<otakon> but is anyone dissappointed in the titles so far?
<PonySwaggRevenge> That was a good overall slice of life episode
<Trollestia> Wait... Oh. That's wierd.
<MadSurge> Hey, she's named FLUTTERshy, not FLYshy.
<Kinixys> Sweetie Belle doesn't really know her talent yet.
<pony_boat> They're showing their maturing
<DocSane> Snips and Snails can use simple magic.
<KrazyNoobs> SuperBrony64 Cool story bro
<lelouch_kagamine> WHERE IS MY GAK COMMERCIAL?!
<tdijk> Clearly all the CMCs are slow developers, else they'd have their CMs already
<Stellafera> This season has had so many great RD moments, I think she might be superseding Rarity as second best pony.
<Deacon> oh that's the next one
<Chrysalis> its like scootscootaloo last week
<otakon> they used to be a bit punny
<Kandarihu> Kurra, you're right. She DOES want to learn to fly, but she doesn't have access to proper training services like what can be found in Cloudsdale.
<AmethystStar> Our little CMC's are growing up ;u;
<PonyStationVita> plz no gak
<GAKisBACK> what bike, superbrony64 ?
<GameTaco> Sweetie Belle only learns one spell: Self Destruct. She can only cast it once.
<KrazyNoobs> GAK WILL RETURN IN 2 WEEKS, BE PATIENT
<Tobiwan> RainbowDashSaviour I work for the show
<StupidSexyCJ> SuperBrony64: get it, you know you want to
<Chrysalis> spoiling that trixie was in it
<otakon> but now the titles are very straight to the point
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: the question is, though, Would you buy it/
<Ninjazz> otakon, very. No subtly at all.
<Hugs|Shower> But seriously, I'm gonna shower cause I have flour and pancake batter all over me
<BlitzWing00> The babies were having a power spirt
<pony74402> do u even gak?
<Chrysalis> i didnt know until he said it on stream
<Zippoman924> Fillies can't control their magic when they first get it, Rember the episode when rarity got her cutie mark.
<Hugs|Shower> Don't killl each other
<pony47368> she didnt pick up anything when she used her magic
<DocSane> Scoots definitely sounded older in this episode.
<AJIsAwesome> I've always loved this season. I've had faith in this season since the beginnning and will continue to do so.
<PrincessRealta> LPS is bettert than Pound Puppies
<GlyphicStrike> I say Pegusi have to learn to fly. Why else is there a flight school?
<otakon> Hugs|Shower: lol
<Kencolt> Sweetie Belled doesn't know it yet, but her special talent is apparently being stronger than most Earth Ponies. I mean, LOOK at what she was hauling!
<Kurra> Sweetie Belle is going to have more torque than an Airbus A380 when she grows up.
<GAKisBACK> I GAK
<KrazyNoobs> oibt74402 yes
<Xlerb> the CMC's are to illustrate growing up
<Pillowfeather> Sweetie can't do magic...
<PonyStationVita> shut the gak up
<KrazyNoobs> pony 74402 yes
<RaveBrony> I didnt really pay attetnion to the titles O.o
<PonySwaggRevenge> Okay wait
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: me too :3
<RainbowDashSavior> dont believe
<RainbowDashSavior> lol
<MadSurge> ^
<matttheshadowman> gak is self aware
<Xlerb> like not all kids can do everything adults can do
<BlueVanilla> Luna has an accent in this ep
<pony74402> GAK GAK GAK
<pants> Whoa nice rap
<pony_boat> They're magic/strength/flying will improve as the show continues, I think
<Hugs|Shower> otakon: You should see the chocolate pancakes I made <3
<Me_> Wait, if Luna does dreams, what does Celestia get to mirror that...
<OohShiny> CMC will be G4.5
<pants> Thts game
<GAKisBACK> What if those voice actors DIE, like DUCKY from Land of the Los
<K1> I like the cutiemark thing as a background story
<Zippoman924> Yes
<Xlerb> you don't emerge from your mom in your 20's
<pony_5689> ursj
<AppleJake> pUBERTY ePISODE
<pony_5689> yeah
<Kurra> Me_ .... daydreams!
<Kammerjunk> I'm just calling it now, it's different than people imagine.
<Mintmaddog> yea
<Trollestia> WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN IS THE CHARACTERS GET THEIR CUTIE MARKS AND THEN HELP OTHER PONIES CUTIE MARKS
<PonySwaggRevenge> Me_: THAT IS THE QUESTION
<pony_3745> ok lets say she can't fly have her learn parkour and get her cutie mark that way
<Gligarman_> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS FRANCHISE
<pony47368> how do you chat
<amatobrony> celestia gets nothing Luna is best princess
<pony_4908> DON'T PUT A TIMER ON THE SHOW :'(
<keystroke> Who's dat pony getting a groove on?
<Gligarman_> yay
<Stellafera> I think I prefer it that they NEVER get their cutie marks
<Vinyl9291> pass on the cape
<BaconMane> 0,5Cutie Mark Recruiting
<AJIsAwesome> When I first heard the Magic Duel, I immediately thought of a Twilight trial instead of a Trixie challenge.
<RaveBrony> The Pinkie ep boosted my hopes for this Season through the Roof!
<Conyst> that would be good
<Cosmo> I'm sure there will be an episode where only one CMC gets their mark and then it'll be a loyalty lesson.
<KrazyNoobs> BYE BYE, BRONYSTATE, I need to sleep, it's 2:10AM
<Pillowfeather> I want the to get their cutie marks
<twilightpls> That's true
<pants> Whoa my bladder is calling me
<pony_4908> WHY THIS TALK OF THE SHOW ENDING? :'(
<RedRookieRebel> CMC forever
<pants> AWAY
<Hiro_> And then the CMC becomes a world organisation
<pony_boat> Do a Scrubs finale
<Pillowfeather> It would be epic
<AlienWarhead> bye KrazyNoobs
<Pinkies4thWall> Ohai BaconMane.
<BlueVanilla> 12:18 AM XD
<Voidspher3> spinoff
<CriticKitten> ....I like that actually
<Xlerb> 4.5 would be awesome
<OohShiny> CMC will be G4.5, they will get their cutie marks, and they still write letters to celestia, even the though the mane six is not arround
<Kandarihu> Babs Seed also had that problem in Manehattan, and might know other fillies and colts who also are late in finding their cutie marks.
<Kurra> dude that 's some skill there o.o;
<Trollestia> 4.5...? FUCK NAWWW- well, maybe. Sure.
<PonySwaggRevenge> Not necessarily a world organization
<Elastmus> Who is talking again/
<Obsidian> Im fine with that
<Hugs|Shower> otakon: http://i.imgur.com/uQ0mm.jpg
<reineir_crypt> hmm maybe...
<GAKisBACK> OMG OMG OMG - THEORY - THEY WILL ALL HAVE THE SAME CUTIE MARK! - THAT WILL BE 3 CRUSADER CAPES!
<StupidSexyCJ> the CMC is how they make demograpic focused episodes i think
<mio> ahhh i missed episodeT.T now got wait all day see it
<Stemglass> CMC is in Ponyville and Manehatten has a Branch now. that means Diamond Tiara and Silverspoon are the First Templars.
<crazitaco> the CMC becomes a world power O.O
<PonySwaggRevenge> But a sorrority of sorts
<Paper> Drogss!!
<Hugs|Shower> Ok I'm off for realsies now
<Xlerb> hey we thought 4 would be shit
<OohShiny> G4.5 SHOULD BE CANON!
<Hugs|Shower> Baaai~
<Xlerb> and look how wrong we were
<Gligarman_> The CMCs were originally supposed to be a spinoff, after all

<GAKisBACK> TOP it came to me in a dream! Luna told me. She told me GAK is BACK

<Sammi> So many commercials x~x
<Venny_> im leaving you guys talk forever
<Zippoman924> I am 15 so I only have 3 years
<Gligarman_> When you're young, you're always in a rush to grow up
<pony_269> have you EVER rewatched 90s cartoons? some of them that you thought were awesome are awwwwwful
<BlitzWing00> Movies have gotten better
<pony47368> who me
<Eli> Kammerjunk: he's not nominated anywhere! it's a crime
<Stemglass> actually: being an adult is not too bad as long as you don't allow yourself to conform to expectations of being one./
<GAKisBACK> I'm 25, I love my life, and I act like a child with pokemon posters and ponies at my desk, and I feel more childish than ever, life is good, and the only thing I worry about is GAK
<Gligarman_> But when you're older, you wish you could be younger
<Ninjazz> The only thing I remember from my childhood was Blues Clues.
<CrMaReLi> awwwww dat pillows :3

<Graywolf71> In terms of cartoons the Saturday mornings of today have nothing on those in the 80's
<Trollestia> ASSSSSSS
<OohShiny> That's different in Brazil.
<Cosmo> Everyone freaked out when they showed an ass on NYPD:Blue.
<pants> 15 is long enough to know I LOVEE GAK
<BuckinDerpster> fuckin pillowpets.
<Gligarman_> Life is horribly ironic
<Owl> applejack said Bitchin in an episode
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: I LOVED Blue's Clues. You have NO IDEA.
<BuckinDerpster> XD
<DocSane> See, I want an episode where Rarity and AJ get deaged because they can explore why it's so frustrating to be a kid.
<Sammi> X3
<Voidspher3> i agree
<BronyofDestiny> 90s had Batman and ANimaniacs, now we have MLP and Adventure Time. Not a bad trade.
<Deacon> pony_269 and some of the awful things are now awesome

<GAKisBACK> ROCKO

<TBi> YEAH
<VenHur> SuperBrony64: [holds a briefcase and opens it] All of my goddamn money.
<Gligarman_> Does Young Justice count?
<GameTaco> I'm just glad shows like The Aquabats Super Show exist, where they know they have to be kid-friendly, but they... Don't do a lot more than that. I'm sure that's largely why Weird Al cameos when possible, his show was supposedly the same way. Gotta be educational, but just barely.
<Dark92Enigma-> old Spongebob is best Spongebob
<pants> Spongebob is cartoons
<Cyclone_Dusk> I like that this new golden age has begun
<AJIsAwesome> Yep. Everything practically has a Golden Age and a Falling age.
<PrincessRealta> gravity falls!
<thedeus> And Regular Show
<BuckinDerpster> the one that was flying next to RD.
<PonyStationVita> this is the 2nd gold age
<Grissess> Extreme dislike of spongebob here.
<Kotano> I..I like spongebon
<Dr_Fumbles> I hate what Spongebob became
<Trollestia> Adventure time, come one grab your friends
<Blazing_Beatz> I find Spongebob so annoying now
<Ninjazz> I wouldn't exactly call this a golden age.
<Sumica> 00,10half those shows suck
<Stellafera> Avatar the last airbender is AMAZING
<prince-dari> Eh, Adventure Time
<Beatfox> Stemglass: 30-somethings represent! Just turned 33 a few days ago, haha.
<pony_7848> avatar is shit, it's nowhere near "golden age" wtf
<GAKisBACK> DAE PETE & PETE?
<Dark92Enigma-> Scoot-Scootaloo: you guys forgot BATMAN TAS
<Owl> what about Littlest pet shop?
<Stemglass> Aquabats is amazing ^^
<Nizati> The last golden age had Gargoyals...
<Latios> animes are overall better than US-shows
<pony_587> Ironic that we are having this conversation. Animainiacs is coming on The Hub starting Christmas Eve.

<Dark92Enigma-> Ren And Stimpy is AWESOME
<OohShiny> MLP is Canadian
<President_Pony> it devolved into that after all the good writers left
<Kandarihu> There were only a few Adult Swim series that I enjoyed, everything from the first generation included. But I enjoyed most of the anime they had.
<OohShiny> HAHA
<pony_2962> <_<
<pony50368> how do you use the mike
<Stellafera> And that is why I love Avatar:The Last Airbender
<matttheshadowman> Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon is shit I agree
<Beatfox> I stopped watching cartoons in the early '90s because I thought I had become too "cool" for it. :(
<Kurra> For those talking in the stream: Welcome to Neo-Dada, have a nice day! 8D
<Stemglass> Superjail is just F-ed up :D

<toxic-mario> teen titans is returning!<3
<Stellafera> So many songs
<GameTaco> crazitaco: Agreed. It has its place, but... I'm just not sure if it should comprise so much of modern television.
<K1> X-Men was pretty badass
<Gligarman_> The last episode for Teen Titans let me witness my first massive flame war
<pony_3045> Adultswim shows is da best
<Stemglass> Clerks?
<thedeus> Oh and am I the only who liked Chowder and Flapjack
<Zamer> Mobile Suit Gundam was also an anime i was more referencening thecartoons for the U.S.
<OohShiny> LPS is made out of songs
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Trust me, the point of Gundam is to sell model kits.
<SoarinYoshi64> Animaniacs is best show ever! :3
<AJIsAwesome> ......
<TropicalWings> Regular Show's good...
<Grissess> Then a cop busts in
<pony50368> what happend to my little pony
<Nik> There was a Clerks cartoon.
<Dark92Enigma-> AJIsAwesome: hi! did you see the new ep?
<crazitaco> this whole LPS scene makes me sad :'(
<Ninjazz> Regular Show's alriiiiigt. I'm suprised there's fans for it though.
<Zamer> which was under the FCC
<pony_7848> Regular Show is awesome
<PonyStationVita> i think chowder was the end of the 1st golden age
<Ninjazz> Whoooaaa shipping.
<VenHur> I'm baaaaack!
<Trollestia> It was hilarious.
<Grissess> And rotates his head 360 degrees
<pony_7848> wtf is with the hate
<Stemglass> Clerks cartoon wasn't bad at all.
<OohShiny> fail
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma-: I sure did. I LOVED it.
<Mellowmuse> PPG were originally the Whoopass girls
<Graywolf71> Don't forget ZOIDS
<Kurra> LPS is made out of software I think....
<J_E_Smith71> Hey there AJIsAwesome
<Grissess> then flies out the door
<OohShiny> aww
<djpon> wtf
<pants> LPS makes me wanna kil myself

<Trollestia> ultimateshemale: Oh look, another spammer.
<Mistshadow> Egg nog is disgusting.
<Kandarihu> DocSane, the point of Gundam is to make a mech series that makes more sense than Mazinger Z. You weren't involved in the production, were you?
<VenHur> And yes SuperBrony64, I remember those promotional Nintendo Power tapes, I only had the Star Fox 64 one.

<AJIsAwesome> It's overdone, but not overrated.
<Stellafera> I love MLP songs
<UPG> oh
<K1> This Day Aria is underrated. Smile song is overrated
<OohShiny> SPAM SPAMMITY
<Ta_Dikin> Winter wrap up
<Hope_N_Forever_Prime> Nobody likes The Amazing World of Gumball?
<CallingCthulhu> Love is in Bloom is a better song :V
<Trollestia> So many fucking spammers.

<pony_831> I actually enjoy Regular Show?
<Gligarman_> FAILURE TROLLS YOU ARE

<Kandarihu> Phase4, I dunno. Divine providence, I guess.
<No0neSpecial> You trolls suck misserably
<Latios> its overrated, BBBF and love is in bllom was better

<Grissess> Thank you for being so interested in this chat that you feel you should spam it. Seriously. Thanks.
<Latios> awesome song
<AJIsAwesome> This Day Aria isn't overrated, it's just overplayed and overhyped.
<BronyofDestiny> Why are they giving trolls pointers?
<sleepy_pony> smile
<Phase4> 00,02GAKisBACK, well we're laughing at them so..

<Blazing_Beatz> I still love how they hacked the stream during an episode about bullying
<SpeccyRush> SaxyPretender: read that as climax
<PrincessRealta> i don't like care bears
<Ninjazz> You know, the secret is to ignore them. ACKNOWLEDING THEM DOESN'T HELP.
<Dark92Enigma-> pony_831 their the saving grace of CM
<Nick> So many wonders?
<Kencolt> Smile is like a Brony Anthem!
<CurePony> :):):)
<pants> the songs make me cringe at first but then 10 mins later some youtube fixes it

<GAKisBACK> Phase4 we're SMILING at them
<Sumica> 00,10Buckets of oats is best song
<K1> The songs are way too long for a 20 minute show though.
<PrincessRealta> care bears is for babies
<SoarinYoshi64> What about Winter Wrap Up? That's the best song ever lol :P
<Kandarihu> HeyMisterDerp, you'll only make them feel special if you do it. All they want is lulz, so we must starve them of it.
<Latios> come on everybrony, smile smile smile !
<Stellafera> Well don't listen to them so much then
<prince-dari> And I fucking hate This Day Aria
<Beatfox> That's the thing about a huge fandom. You tend to get oversaturated with the material.
<Owl> acid is safer then weed
<MadSurge> I like the songs, but I don't remember all of them :/
<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, D: D:
<Rappafoin> someone here have the voice like Pinkie pie?
<Stemglass> @Sumica /)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02prince-dari: Spoiler: The last word in the song is 'Smile'
<Laroid> Please don't crash this time, Bronystate
<GAKisBACK> omg - I listened on EndlessYoutube SMILE SMILE SMILE song like 50times yest at work
<Vordox> The only non overdone song is...
<Sumica> 00,10can you care less for it Dari?
<Dark92Enigma-> PrincessRealta: always have always did
<Vordox> You guessed it
<DocSane> I tried listening to Everfree Radio. There's a lot of terrible sincere Brony music out there.
<djblazekin> winter wrap up is stuck in my head
<Ta_Dikin> it is
<Ninjazz> prince-dari, you could care less about that?
<Mellowmuse> How about Babs Seed song?
<prince-dari> No, I couldn't care less, actually.
<crazitaco> honestly i have to hear the song 3-5 times to develope an appreciation for it
<AJIsAwesome> I like all the songs in MLP: FIM, but there's a limit to how much I can listen to it for a set amount of time.
<Kyiko> living tombstone ver?
<pony_boat> That song grew on me
<Stemglass> Babs Seed = almost best song
<Zippoman924> I liked the Babs seed song
<GAKisBACK> AND the SMILE SMILE SMILE video is PERFECT
<pants> Winter Wrap Up Winter Wrap Uppppp
<Ninjazz> I don't like Bad Seed.
<prince-dari> Winter Wrap Up is the shit
<BlitzWing00> Smile Smile Smile Skyrim Video, lol
<Gligarman_> Bad Seed is a nostalgia trip for all the 80s shows
<OohShiny> Puke rainbowws
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: aye
<prince-dari> Screw all these other songs
<Stellafera> Winter Wrap Up feels so distant...
<GAKisBACK> I could be considering suicide, then listen to SMILE SMILE SMILE and rainbows will shoot out of my ass
<PonyStationVita> lol no der
<Kandarihu> Yeah. I hated This Day Aria at first, but then I got used to it.
<pants> Babs seed sounded ok
<TropicalWings> look at all the fail trolls
<Ninjazz> The lyrics are just off for me.
<Grissess> DOCTOR, I THINK I MAY BE A HOMOSEXUAL
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, smile smile smile is condensed happy
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind Bad Seed.
<VenHur> No one seems to remember the Film Flam Brothers song any more...
*Grissess RAINBOWS
<President_Pony> Penny just needs to listen to the Smile song and she'd stop moping...
<pants> How can you tell
<RedRookieRebel> BronyDancePartverison was good
<pony_269> too many remixes! #firstworldproblems
<Sumica> 00,10I agreee Dari it is a fave
<Kurra> Wiggle Your Rump = da bess
<Trollestia> SO MANY FUCKING REMIXES
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: so did you like this episode? :3
<GameTaco> Puddin' pie.
<Graywolf71> exactly
<Stemglass> Oh hell yes
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if it wasn't for Winter Wrap Up, I wouldn't be here
<flitter_heart22> luna needs to sing!!!!<3
<GAKisBACK> was that GAK at the end?
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I am GUSHING over this episode.
<Dark92Enigma-> prince-dari: i agree here too
<Top> unfortunately
<Gligarman_> you know what song I want
<djblazekin> smile smile smile is the brony prozac
<Jageman> The Tombstone remix of Smile, Smile, Smile is good.
<PrincessRealta> NEW EP!
<twiluna> thats real world for ya
<OohShiny> I like the "step ahead" accent
<TropicalWings> Season 3 is making all thins fanon CANON
<pants> Didnt even notice LPS ended
<Gligarman_> I want Fluttershy to finish that damn lullaby
<K1> People who hate This Day Aria just don't understand music. It's one of the best villain songs out there
<Pinkies4thWall> Fact. Smile has got me through some dark shit
<NASCARFAN160_2> ^
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: I mean not just because of Rarity :D
<Top> both were good
<PonyStationVita> goodbye everypony im going
<Stemglass> I have a friend who's a composer that makes Brony music that is *amazing* still cannot get the attention he deserves
<Beatfox> If you're doing it for the most views, though, you're doing it wrong.
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkies4thWall: Same.
<Ta_Dikin> Yay~
<GAKisBACK> SexyPretender you considered suicide until you heard that beautiful song?
<PrincessRealta> can ppl shut up now?
<Rappafoin> And it wasn't that good.
<NASCARFAN160_2> This show is surprisngly good in terms of psychology.
<BlitzWing00> Prime time dude.
<Duality-Sparkle> hey radio we want the episode!
<Dark92Enigma-> The song that brought me was ''May The Best Pet Win''
<Top> fair enough

<LoneBlackhoves> ya I totally agree
<GameTaco> Hairbow?
<PonyStationVita> bye evrypony me g2g
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, suprisingly not. She was a big part of it, but this episode was genuinely done well.
<thedeus> Paleo said that
<Duality-Sparkle> I want to watch hear the voices!
<Vordox> Which remix?
<Gligarman_> what remix?
<toxic-mario> JayB - babs Seed
<GAKisBACK> he just had a GAKism
<Trollestia> Did anyone else love Luna's sultry voice?
<Duality-Sparkle> not the damn radio!
<GAKisBACK> LINK TO SONG

<Kandarihu> When a Touhou character is first revealed in an announcement of a new game, fanart of that character shows up within a few hours, and it's pretty decent artwork.
<Duality-Sparkle> JFYI!
<toxic-mario> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71OLj5gMMDY
<GAKisBACK> LINK MY FACE, PLEASE!
<BronyofDestiny> The Babs Seed song was spoiled a few days before the episode aired, so he probably did spend time on it.
<DewlShock> legend
<Calcos323> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71OLj5gMMDY
<GAKisBACK> thanks
<toxic-mario> THERE'S THE SONG
<Ninjazz> Tomb's remix of Bad Seed was awful.
<pony_3045> lag
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: agreed :) Also more Tabitha goodness with Luna!
<Kencolt> So... you're saying that it's a lot like World of Warcraft after an expac/patch is released, and every musician is dashing off for a "World First"? That's sad.
<Vinyl9291> its called SUSCABE to him
<CrazyGreg> Thank You
<Vordox> WHICH REMIX of Babs seed were they talking about?
<GAKisBACK> toxic-mario is a GOD
<GAKisBACK> thanks
<crazitaco> well, now i must go and watch LPS.
<PrincessRealta> so i can hear what they are saying?
<Trollestia> Thanks toxic-mario :)
<GAKisBACK> BRB
<GAKisBACK> after this song
<pants> When will GAK be back?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Oh awesome Happy Tre-oh wait...

<Top> thanks calcos!
<djblazekin> the hub is the better nartoon network
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, ikr
<Duality-Sparkle> CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE KILL THE RADIO?
<OohShiny> mean isn't your color?
<pony_269> also, saying "first is rewarded the most" isn't really true after about a week or so... like the best remixes of all the previous songs are known, not who was first
<GameTaco> That outfit seriously is adorable. Maybe Blythe is humanized Applebloom?
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, i made the same mistake first time i saw it
<Zelda> >mean isn't your color
<AJIsAwesome> Duality-Sparkle: Be patienr.
<OohShiny> That creativity
<PrincessRealta> is there a stream without talking over it?
<AJIsAwesome> *patient
<Jageman> search youtube for Hanni13579
<AJIsAwesome> PrincessRealta: No.
<Trollestia> THAT WAS ADORABLE
<Mistshadow> MEAN ISN"T YOUR COLOR? MEAN ISNT YOUR COLOR? Such creativith. TOTALLY not Green Isn't Your Color
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, even though the fandom has been speculating about whether or not Luna can enter dreams ever since a fanfic I can't remember the title of, I think the ability works.
<pants> That monkey is pink
<pony_9102> They don't talk during the airing of episodes
<Jageman> My chat crashed
<OohShiny> pants: no shit, sherlock?
<pony_3045> pet show shit
<Duality-Sparkle> pony_9102 correct they didn't last time
<Kurra> waaah I crashed AGAIN nooooo ;.;
<Kurra> I lost all the links
<BladedWings> Jageman: it'll do that some time lol
<Zippoman924> My girlfriend is making her own version of Fighting is magic
<flitter_heart22> <3 luna needs to sing!!! <3
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: also I love she helps childrem overcome their nightmares :3c
<Palamon> So does Princes Celsetia~.
<Zippoman924> Yes Luna has to sing
*Duality-Sparkle slaps the radiocrew
<Palamon> **Celestia
<Phase4> 00,02flitter_heart22, that
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Monkey has fur...and then hair...wut
<TBi> that would be cool
<AJIsAwesome> I'd like to see a duet between Celestia and Luna.
<Stellafera> Arrogent Penny Ling is arrogant
<Phase4> 00,02Luna song would be incredible
<amatobrony> Luna song would make me fangasm so hard
<Silence> Sorry!
<sleepy_pony> i hope theres a luna episode with her singing
<thedeus> And what about Double Rainboom the fan episode
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ponypokey
<Blazing_Beatz> The Day Luna Sings....the Day the Fandom will EXPLODE

<BerryPunch> Title on talesofthewinterborn.deviantart.com: ScootaLuna by ~talesofthewinterborn on deviantART
<Top> Phase4 that would make my day!
<Ninjazz> Ooohboi.
<Stellafera> Also I love Blythe's outfit this episode. It reminds me of AJ.
<GameTaco> Seriously.
<Trollestia> DAT SWEETIE FACE WHEN SQUEE
<imgay> luna is our god
<djblazekin> the leak was sent out in a similar nature to the half life 2 leak
<Zedrin> Does fan content of Luna singing count? :P
<SoundStream> Bye Everypony
<TheKoreanBrony1354> bye
<GAKisBACK> bye pony
<Deacon> what was the game called again?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Quibblyball, was it?
<VenHur> What the game is called?
<GAKisBACK> it was called GAK ATTACK
<Trollestia> Scoots and Luna in one episode? But my birthday was last week!
<Blazing_Beatz> But I agree....Luna needs to have a song
<Trollestia> Blazing_Beatz: On that day, we all die.
<Beatfox> taptapatap tap
<Kencolt> I'd like to point out a rather admirable thing about "Littlest Pet Shop". It takes into consideration that a teenage girl DOESN'T wear the same outfit every time-- Blythe realistically changes outfit regularly-- two-three times an episode. In other words, it's like a real girl.
<AJIsAwesome> Both Luna and Celestia need a song.
<GAKisBACK> if Luna SONGS, I will GAK all over the place!
<Zedrin> http://youtu.be/SLMvyX5yqXI Luna singing :v (fan made)
<Stellafera> No, I think that too much Luna is a bad thing. I like this small but sensible appearance.
<pants> Yes
<imgay> that moment when i relize that luna might not ever sing on mlp:'(

<Trollestia> FUCK DISNEY CHANNEL
<J_E_Smith71> Scoot-Scootaloo: Well if the show stops maybe the comic will keep going who knows
<Ninjazz> My only concern is if the rumors about Hasbro/Hub are trying to migrate the fandom over to LPS.
*SuperBrony64 hugs Scoot-Scootaloo

<Blazing_Beatz> Lol Nickelodeon is a joke
<Sundaysmile> and it had a movie
<GameTaco> But: Spongebob. You know Nick wouldn't *want* MLP to last.
<sleepy_pony> nickelodeaon has soooo much spngebob
<bandit> Don't wwant cartoon to last forever :<
<AJIsAwesome> Luna appearance is nice in the show, but we need to focus on Celestia as well.
<Grissess> This would totally redeem Nick.
<Top> Spinge Bab

<DocSane> I still predict MLP will be retired at 78 episodes.
<President_Pony> Kim Possible is still great
<Me_> Teenage Robot and Zim

<clp605> CND as it would seem.
<Kencolt> PrincessRealta: Actually, considering when it was adapted for the US target audience, it's one of the better dubs. You'd be AMAZED at what some other countries did. Especially most of Europe.
<Cosmo> Life without ponies. Does not compute.
<Deacon> unless you mean blue popo?
<Havok> Outside ponies? Are you crazy?
<BronyofDestiny> A life what of ponies?
<Zamer> don't forget making Sailor Stars crossdressers

<Drahken> Blue Popo!?
<pants> Wait today is december 8 ? did i go back in time
<Gilda> In responce to a question our commontaters asked a while ago: What kind of a question is "Where will the fandom be in a year"? It isn't going anywhere. It'll be like the Star Trek fanbase.
<Ninjazz> Phase4, it's called "outside". Scary place, I hear.
<Kandarihu> So maybe if Toei brings back Sailor Moon in the model of Pretty Cure, it'll be Cure Moon then or something.
<Blazing_Beatz> my life REVOLVES AROUND PONIES MOTHA BUCKER

<imgay> born 1995, i watched the best cartoons before they die
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I've heard EHM was really good
<PrincessRealta> i hope the new avengers cartoon does not suck
<SpeccyRush> SaxyPretender: and now his themes are playing thru my head
*Blazing_Beatz huddles in a corner, crying about the go-bots
<GameTaco> Hm. Why MLP Online, but not Legends of Equestria? Something seems off here.
<Cherry> Yeah
<Gligarman_> greaaat, more copyright infringement .-.
<Zelda> this episode reminds me of that scene in last round up
<aniderp|bestcakeever> abotu nightmare ,moon which has flim and flam
<DocSane> Doesn't matter.
<MadSurge> What? O_o
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and cadence
<aniderp|bestcakeever> o.O
<Welsh_Pony> So hasbro had no choice?
<CCharmanderK> Fuck!! I was REALLY looking forward to playing MLP Online!
<Pinkies4thWall> SAD PANDA
<SaxyPretender> 0,14THAT GAME IS DEAAAAAAAAAD
<Deacon> panda is mad
<pants> The mlp game on android was fun for like 2hours till I had to cheat to continue
<Graywolf71> Of course. They want you to play that MONEY PIT one
<Sundaysmile> so the same will come to light for FIM?
<Squallken> Wait what game?
<Tyler_The_Creator> are they getting rid of MLP??
<Tobiwan> why do they not buy the license
<Tyler_The_Creator> or a game?
<AmethystStar> NOOOOO
<Trollestia> Meghan McCarthy @MMeghanMcCarthy Prediction: Tomorrow -- The episode that launches a 1000 really cool fan-fics. None of wich I'll be able to read :-( Poor Poor Meghan McCarthy.
<Cherri> could someone repost that link please? I just got in here.
<bandit> gyah bad timing for ad. D:
<pony_747> did i miss it?
<DocSane> Now, if Hasbro was wise, they'd just license MLP online.
<Tyler_The_Creator> Are they getting rid of a game or MLP??????
<pony_910> because american copyright law is insane, they had to take it down
<PrincessRealta> anyone play the gameloft game?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i do
<warpout> MY LITTLE INVESTIGATIONS
<Cherry> I do :D
<GameTaco> Trollestia: 1000 Scootaluna fics GO
<Pinkies4thWall> Yup
<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc, Hasbro knows about Fighhting is Magic
<pony_269> this guy loooooves to talk
<Vinyl9291> i do
<aniderp|bestcakeever> its a pain
<pony_747> guys did i miss the episode
<pants> the gameloft game was to harsh on pay to win
<Sundaysmile> My Little Copyright - Lawsuits are Magic
<pony_1187> FUUUUUUUUU-
<Trollestia> GameTaco: 1/3 of those will just be Luna.
<Warloxwill> What the Hey is this?? i came here to watch Ponies
<TBi> :O
<CCharmanderK> I really don't want Fighting is Magic to be canceled.
<pony_4908> Damn US Trademark Law. D:
<PrincessRealta> they need to put free gems in the toys
<Nik> This has happened a few times and the fandom just shrugs it off.
<Kencolt> pony_2962:
<Nik> Don't give them ideas
<Grissess> THEY MUST STREAM IT VIA BITTORRENT
<Nick> im nick
<Deacon> Warloxwill the new episode is over already
<Kencolt> Nothing.
<GameTaco> Trollestia: Heavy Metal Luna, the novel
<Warloxwill> NOOOOOO
<Pinkies4thWall> SaxyPretender: dat shoutoout
<SaxyPretender> 0,14they can't give an offical comment
<Owl> what to do
<NASCARFAN160_2> they shouold
<Phase4> 00,02if hasbro didnt know about fighting is magic i'd be very worried about their pr department
<djblazekin> these parasprites need to die
<Sundaysmile> and bronycon itself
<SaxyPretender> 0,14someone asked a Hasbro at NYCC and they said no offical comment
<J_E_Smith71> Scoot-Scootaloo: Lauren did say that she's looking forward to Fighting is Magic and she said she wishes it were an official retail game
<Tobiwan> I don't think so
<DocSane> Face it: people love to stir the pot and buld the hate.
<Starlight_Phoenix> why doesn't hasbro buy fighting is magic and hire the staff?
<Owl> if theres trolls who report mlp games
<BlitzWing00> They want to play it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*Hasbro rep
<Deacon> what did hasbro shut down?
<Zippoman924> I am sorry if I am spamming but I want to just hear their opnion on Code Lyoko.:'(
<Trollestia> GameTaco: Luna clopfics about sleep. I kid you not. Probably.
<PrincessRealta> they are putting tokens for the LPS game into the toys
<Welsh_Pony> Didn't one of the voice actors say they couldn't wait to play fighting is magic?
<Owl> ban them from he internet
<pony_4908> I'd imagine Hasbro loves EVERYTHING the fandom spits out. It's only a big deal when the government steps in and fucks everything up. :[
<Owl> by smashing there computer
<AJIsAwesome> Trollestia: :S
<Warloxwill> Is there a youtube link of the new episode?
<GameTaco> :3
<Trollestia> AJIsAwesome: Yeah :(
<CCharmanderK> Lauren Faust herself said she wants to play Fighting is Magic.
<pony_269> knowing about it isn't the same as having to take action when it's been reported
<ThatOnePony> I'm back
<Rappafoin> They know. They most know. They keep it because it's not beleivable coming from Hasbro. IT looks more fan related
<BlitzWing00> There wa a demo, and heard nothing after that
<Ninjazz> See, this doesn't bode well. Hasbro used to be all about letting the fandom do whatever it wanted.
<clp605> There IS a Silver Lining. The Devs of MLP: Online are making a another game, they said they will bring something up this coming summer.
<Blazing_Beatz> Still waiting for the 'Double Rainboom' episode...
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back ThatOnePony :)
<Deacon> Warloxwill probably in a few minutes, check EqD to see
<pony_747> guys we missed the episode im to late fuck
<pony_9838> trademark is the name or logo, not the actual thing
<GameTaco> SQUEE
<TBi> squee
<pants> they just used a joke fomr the duck song onLPS
<pony_269> squeeeee!
<Zippoman924> Squee
<Owl> HOLY SHIT
<Tobiwan> sluttershquee
<Blazing_Beatz> SQUEEE
<Graywolf71> FLUTTERSHY SQUEE
<MadSurge> Ohai ThatOnePony!
<Tobiwan> flutter
<Owl> SQUEE IN LPS?
<Starlight_Phoenix> Hasbro should buy out some of these brony indie teams and profit.
<BronyofDestiny> What happened to Silent Ponyville!?
<K1> I could create an MLP Mod for a game, but I doubt that the game's fanbase would approve
<bandit> yes, amatures. ... doing things in their SPARE time!
*ThatOnePony hugs MLP_Brovakiin and MadSurge
<Gligarman_> whys everyone squeeing? Did I miss something?
<Nittany_Discord> Did My Little Investigations die?
<Owl> LAUREN FAUST DEFINETLEY WORKS WITH LPS CREATORS
<Deacon> I know what you mean, pretty ametuers in being structured
<prince-dari> Technically drawing the MLP logo on a napkin in a bar is copyright infringement
<GameTaco> Rubber duck is best pony.
<Gilda> AMERATURES. AMERATURES EVERYWHERE!
<djblazekin> fallout equestria better not get shut down
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs ThatOnePony back :)
<AlienWarhead> K1 which game
<prince-dari> Copyright is bullshit
<AJIsAwesome> Owl: No, she doesn't.
<BlitzWing00> What ever happened to Pony Kart?
<pony_747> why is he hum
<pony_1187> XD
<Nittany_Discord> Agreed Dari.
<Blazing_Beatz> Screw Copyrights...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02pony_747: We didn't miss the episode, post show is right now :)
<pony_4908> Ninjazz: It's not Hasbro in the wrong. They're required by federal law to do these things, or THEY lose the copyright. :|
<Graywolf71> there was a squee on LPS
<DocSane> prince-dari: Trademark, not copyright.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14aw man, now I have to throw out all those napkins
<pony_747> MEGUSTA
<Blazing_Beatz> lol
<K1> AlienWarhead: It's called Dink Smallwood. You can create addons for it. I could create an MLP Mod just for shits and giggles
<pants> the napkins didnt have a chance
<Zamer> hey could be worse Disney could get you 10years for those napkins
<Deacon> Graywolf71 well that sfx is a common stock sound, just check out jimmy from ed edd neddy
<VenHur> Copyright infringement is a BITCH!
<GameTaco> Penny, are you having your Lesson Zero moment? Are you going to make a friendship problem too?
<BlitzWing00> Copyright is bullshit, go Google "Everything is a Remix" videos
<PrincessRealta> not 10 years 10 million dollars
<fluttershy14> i hope fighting is magic wouldnt get shut down i mean hasbro already knows they know about the comunity so it would make sense that they are aware
<Sundaysmile> I've also noticed that when a new game comes out, a lot of production just stops on the amatuer market :P
<Ninjazz> pony_4908, that doesn't change the fact that this is showing a completely different attitude towards developments.
<DocSane> pony_4908: No, they could form a contract with the devs and grant a limited license.
<Top> what about things like Snowdrop and Picture Perfect Pony?
<Zippoman924> agree
<pony_3357> Can anyone point me to a link to the latest episode?
<AlienWarhead> K1 Do it if you want to
<pony_747> anyone listening to me?
<GameTaco> Slendamann, I didn't know you switched to brown suits.
<ThatOnePony> So what's going on? I'm heaing a lot about copyright and stuff
<pony_1187> XD
<ThatOnePony> hearing*
<TBi> lol
<pants> lol so long
<Kencolt> I have a different theroy. It's scale. Something from Silly Filly Studios is, well, a small fanwork on YouTUbe. Not a problem. The scale of Equestria Online brings into problems in, say, Hasbro wants for some reason to make their own. Well...
<Warloxwill> Brown is the new black
<GameTaco> :D
<Nik> Might have them using "My Little Pony" in the name been a factor?
<Coyote> Wait, what's the game that was trashed?
<pants> Slenderpanda
<Deacon> I'm hoping that /vp/ sticks with that pokemon game they're making, they already god a dex and a region
<pony_4908> Coyote: MLP Online
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64?
<Squallken> bbl
<Coyote> Damn
<BurningRainbow> that wasnt a C&D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The problem is, people put their ambitions high for a lot of projects within the community. No-one really wants their project to fail or fall below expectations. However, reality changes a lot of what people want to believe will happen.
<DocSane> The problem is that fan-made pro-quality derivitive merchandise is still unexplored territiry with corporate law.
<PrincessRealta> ppl don't go to jail over copyrights just the poorhouse
<BurningRainbow> it was an argument between team menbers
<Blazing_Beatz> Ponymon!
<Ninjazz> QFT
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 ???
<Coyote> Ah well.
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: QFT?
<Coyote> Thanks all.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14holy shit, 23?
<Blazing_Beatz> Ponymon is going along ok right now...
<GameTaco> Yeah, I naturally wouldn't mind MLPO and LoE getting shutdown if, naturally, it meant a CANON MLP. My thoughts? Let's see if Transformers Online does well.
<Ninjazz> AJIsAwesome, quoted for truth.
<Graywolf71> How about that pony kart game?
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: Ah.
<Deacon> that is alot of conventions
<Phase4> 00,0223 ._.
<pony_1187> Half-Life 3!
<djblazekin> pon3 con
<Gligarman_> 23 conventions, cant and never will be able to go to any of them .-.
<GameTaco> Which beta registrations appear to be open, by the way.
<pony_747> dafuq
<ThatOnePony> 23 conventions
<Top> toooooo many
<PrincessRealta> if something is stopped it is usually cause there is a legit version on the way
<imgay> hmmm i have many fan fiction ideas from you guys. thanks mods
<ThatOnePony> That is a LOT of money
<Conyst> HL3 is a myth
<Ninjazz> Cutting down on the cons is actually a good idea.
<Gligarman_> THE NUMBER OF CONVENTIONS IS TOO DAMN HIGH
<VenHur> 23 conventions?!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<AJIsAwesome> AGreed, Ninjazz.
<VenHur> MAI GUDZ!
<Rappafoin> Good idea!!
<Zippoman924> yea 1 a month sounds good
<bandit> :D whoo i am in ohio! lol
<Nik> I WISH there was a con here...
<Blazing_Beatz> Transformers Online....Also known as Transformers: Ledgends, is in a closed Beta Stage
<GameTaco> I AM A PICKLE
<AlienWarhead> Why Ohio?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14NEC was Philly
<AmethystStar> T_T please have one down here in the south...
<misteriks> http://www.mlponline.net/threads/its-been-a-good-run.1520/
<Tyler_The_Creator> Why Ohio??
<MadSurge> ThatOnePony: apparently Fighting is Magic is in jeopardy
<pony_1187> LOLOLOL
<Blazing_Beatz> Oops
<Nittany_Discord> Danger of convention oversaturation.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Have a convention to be once a month? lol
<Top> BroNYcon and Everfree NW are the only ones needed for North America
<Deacon> well the more the merrior for people who can't be able to go for the conventions out of their reach, but that is too many
<Drahken> Because there's nothing to do here in Ohio
<Gilda> Why Ohio? Simple. There's NOTHING ELSE TO DO in Ohio.
<pony_9102> Meeo.
<VenHur> If DBZ had that many conventions, then HAWLY SHAEET!
<pants> MEEP
<pony_9102> Meep.
<pony_7656> Woo! Ohio's relevent!
<Graywolf71> Kansas is finally getting one next year
<Warloxwill> MEEP
<PrincessRealta> aren't some of these "cons" just glorified meetups?
<imgay> PEOPLE, be sure to go to fimfiction later. the flood of new fics will be over whelming
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I don't think BronyCon can do a convention once a month
<pony_747> meep
<Drahken> we have nothing better to do with our time than plan conventions
<Zippoman924> Okay well I am going to leave now, Bye everyone!:'(
<Sumica> 00,10they meen there should only be 12 cons SuperBrony64
<Blazing_Beatz> I mean Transformers: Universe...Is going along real well. They are about to hit Closed Beta
<Coyote> Heheheheheh. I have an anti-brony friend in Ohio
<pony_9102> Meep
<Warloxwill> WE ARE THE KNIGHTS WHO SAY... MEEP
<Gilda> Even Indiana has more things to do in it than Ohio
<bandit> Cons in northeast ohio really stink, because we have no good places to hold them
<Sumica> 00,10not one group doing 12
<pony_8595> derp
<imgay> bye
<Sumica> 00,1012 groups period
<bandit> :/ they should never be up here in neo
<pony_747> bye
<CubanAmericanBrony> Yay IL!
<Drahken> What, you mean the Strongsville Holiday Inn wasn't a great place?
<bandit> No.
<PrincessRealta> this is perfect for klutzes
<Coyote> I'm either going to trick him into going to one, or just point out that his state has a shit ton of them
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sumica: OOOooh that makes sense :P
<Ta_Dikin> Magic tap!!
<Coyote> Mwahahahahaha
<pants> That crap is battery powerd really
<Pinkies4thWall> Fuck. At this rate, I will never go to a con
<djblazekin> yeah cuz canterlot gardens was at the same time as pon3 con
<WhatTheDerp-> dat magic friggin tap.
<bandit> Canterlot Gardens was impossible to get into if you didn't prereg
<pants> Magic tap
<pony_5615> I am loving this ad
<Wol4ik> КАРАБЕТ- ПИДОР.
<ThatOnePony> Hell, I can't even make it to a convention where I'm living right now, let alone make it to one out of state or out of country
<Kandarihu> As long as the 12 conventions are spread out well enough that people who can't travel very far for a convention will be able to go to ONE every year
<Blazing_Beatz> I wanna go to TrotCon and BronyCon
<ThatOnePony> Uh-oh
<Warloxwill> ^^
<Gilda> But there's nothing magical about it. It's just a straw with a fan in it.
<Drahken> The Magic Tap is fucking WITCHCRAFT
<GameTaco> ...Am I ironically a bad person for wanting to go Autobot? Like, I feel like if I went Decepticon, Peter Cullen's voice would shout NO, and I would be compelled to double back.
<Graywolf71> not everybody can get to conventions like Bronycon
<Ninjazz> I think cons should be more location based seperated by quarters of the year. But one would have to assume the ammount of people coming at the venue.
<AlienWarhead> PrincessRealta: Cons are very fun, it is way different than a meetup, panels, dealers room, artist alley, game rooms and seeing thousands of fans, they are awesome
<Deacon> really now?
<djblazekin> pon3 con was awsome we had fan vas
<Zamer> lol GameTaco i decided go to Decepticons
<pants> WHY ARENT I NOMINATED
<Zamer> even though i wanted to go Autobots
<AlienWarhead> pants they won last year
<PrincessRealta> i have been to comic cons before
<pony_5615> They need a con in D.C.
<Zamer> but i have a feeling more people would have went Autobots thought
<bandit> D: same day?
<pony_747> dont wait dont delay or well rip your nuts off
<pants> oh few
<Gligarman_> We're gonna run out of names for Cons at this rate
<Rappafoin> That's way too much!
<Blazing_Beatz> Thats alot of Cons to visit...Pinkie Pie would have had a field day
<SaxyPretender> 0,14not really
<PrincessRealta> but i can't imagine there being that many bronies in some areas
<Trollestia> Maybe they should be less conny and more meetuppy.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dev is just going slow
<GameTaco> Pony convention on the moon.
<Gilda> What like a Meet'n'Greet?
<pony_4094> :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(
<ThatOnePony> I didn't think there were that many cons in one year
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Thing is, I actually think there should be as many conventions in as many places as possible. I mean, for those that want to go to all of them, it's unfortunate, but it opens up the community to going to more conventions. If there is a limit, some might not be local enough for people to attend them. However, I do agree there should be some communication among conventions to make sure
<SuperBrony64> 11,2that a convention doesn't happen at the same time as someone elses' for those who wish to go to multiples of them.
<AlienWarhead> PrincessRealta: Didn't Bronycon get 4,000 people last year
<Phase4> 00,02emotespam then 64spam
<ThatOnePony> Like, one a year is enough because that's a lot of saving up
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah
<GameTaco> Make it STAWP~
<Cherry> Where is Canterlot Gardens held at?
<Silence> Having cons spread out makes more sense
<ThatOnePony> But 23? Holy fucking shit.
<Gilda> Furry conventions always have a Pony Meet'n'Greet, that's a given.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Canterlot Gardens was in Ohio
<PrincessRealta> not talking about the bigguns
<pony_747> :(
<Drahken> CG was in Cleveland
<Warloxwill> MOAR CONS to make it shorter
<Blazing_Beatz> Wasn't Trotcon where Silva Hound played 'Everypony's Banging'?
<bandit> Strongsville Ohio
<Vinyl9291> yes super i love that i wish there was a con closer to where i live
<pony_269> so what? if they're in completely different locations, the only issue might be spreading VAs thin. not everyone has a chance to go all the way to NY or whatever
<toxic-mario> mhm
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you know what we need?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14BUSTAH WOLF CON
<SaxyPretender> 0,14EVERYONE GETS PUNCHED
<Ninjazz> SuperBrony64, I think the biggest problem is cons trying to get talent from the show in there.
<GameTaco> OKAI
<Melancholy> Cons in kentucky
<Ninjazz> SaxyPretender, that's sounds really okay.
<Hi> Wasup
<Gilda> ARE YOU OKAY!?
<pony_747> im bored skrim was better
<Deacon> SaxyPretender all the engrish insults!
<Hi> :)
<Trollestia> SuperBrony64: Of course, but like I said, more meetuppy, less conny, so we don't have Hasbro having to send out representatives or whatnot.
<Sumica> 00,10bleh politicking
<Hi> 6_9
<Gilda> POWAH DAAAANK
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Depends on the strength of people there.
<AlienWarhead> PrincessRealta: Small ones can be good too, they still have con stuff and shorter lines
<Warloxwill> Politics? With ponies???

<Graywolf71> I was able to go to Silly Filly con this year because it was within driving distance, which is the only way I can get anywhere
<bandit> I'd rather a con be in Pittsburgh than north east ohio..
<alexxm> how've you been AJIsAweosme and BladedWings
<Conyst> Spaghetti as far as the eye can see.
<pants> The spaghetti can only be held By hefty bags
<Zippoman924> back just to say Snowdrop looks Epic

<AlienWarhead> PrincessRealta: Have fun
<Drahken> Pittsburgh isn't that far from Cleveland. you could have come to CG. I went to Pittsburgh for just an evening to see Zelda: Symphony of the Goddess
<Blazing_Beatz> They Need to Have CONS in the Southeastern areas like Atlanta and such...
<PrincessRealta> i is a huge dork
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, 23 is way toomany
<AlienWarhead> there was a topic?
<pony_4908> Are you kidding? Hasbro LOVES the fandom. It's just legal things that get in the way sometimes. :|
<SaxyPretender> 0,14a few regional cons should be good
<pony_747> guys we are all brothers of the same clan
<bandit> I LIVE in Northeast Ohio

<Ta_Dikin> Yay~

<Zohrd> Best team ever
<fluttercry> 05,15It's not going to happen. Valve is too wrapped up in Steam now to ever actually make Half Life 3. Plus they can never meet the expectations that have been set for them, and they know it.
<ShiningDawn> dr freeman is not mute
<Khaos> Curses! An add!
<otakon> fluttercry: LIAR! IT'S NOT TRUE!
<Trollestia> fluttercry: Quiet plz :'( You're making ME cry
