<MaxTheBrony> Im working on a concept for a game :p
<alexxm> how are things MaxTheBrony
<Invi> Lil_B, but Luna and lyra are awesome :3
<Lil_B> hi MaxTheBrony
<Stormy`> What if you didn't buy it?
<MaxTheBrony> alexxm: Things are good :) How about you?
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Lil_B :)
<Kimori> ship it then?
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: aye; that's why i dual boot with Mac OS, in order to use Adobe programs
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if it came in the car down there with you then its OK but they can ask you to prove it.
<alexxm> i'm good MaxTheBrony
<Saturn> 08,01but Wine seems fine with some stuff i use
<Lil_B> Invi yes, but all the colors in Wave 6 / Euro Wave V are way too bright
<Jmo> Poor excuse Max.
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Invi> Lil_B, oh okay
<Vivix> Aah-hm- yeah, Wine has become pretty good. I don't do much computer stuff though, but I've become fond of programming again, just JS so far, but I do miss Cpp
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if its a gift you have to have paperwork showing it is a gift and then it has to have some sort of value on it.
<MaxTheBrony> :p alllright il confess ive been a bit lazy Jmo :)
<kidzrul434> what's the worst shipping you can think of?
<Jmo> Bloody oath you have.
<Vivix> Worst shipping? 500 dollars for a plushie
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> LOL this reminds me of something funny… our main supplier is down in New Mexico, and the owner and his wife came up here to canada to meet with us and say Hi
*Vivix totally missing hte point totally not on like purpose
<Jmo> O U Vivix.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Hi everypony!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Kawaii_icybeauti

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and im like
<Kawaii_icybeauti> hi ASoftFluffyThing did you get your trading cards yet?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "Yeah those damn americans keep on trying to get into our country."
<BladedWings> hi Kawaii_icybeauti
<Kawaii_icybeauti> hi BladedWings
<Jmo> Still don't see how shipping could cost that much
<Vivix> Probably bad autocalculator
<Lil_B> When I buy a new PC I'll get a firned to help me with setting up a Linux / Windows Dual Boot
<Invi> Jmo, maybe they buy a ship just for that ^^
<Vivix> hopefully, hell, I payed 30 euro for shipping a bass, those are oversized and heavy packages
<Lil_B> I wanna use Linux, but I play a lot of Games on the PC
<Invi> or fill a whole container
<Jmo> Har har har :P

<Chrysalis> who wanted full setups, amps/speakers/desks
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, Dark92Enigma! :)
<Chrysalis> and others who were happy with the PA system we already had
<ASoftFluffyThing> Unless she has teh game running on her other monitor
<Kimori> hi
<Saturn> 08,01no
<Amu-chan> Hi!
<Saturn> 08,01i'm batman.
<Buytoast> ha, i remember when i thought i would be a good programmer
<Buytoast> how easily dreams shatter
<Kimori> how goes?
<Meanwhile> Kermit is best Batman.
<Saturn> 08,01for some reason my terminal decided to output ?s for every key i typed
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<ASoftFluffyThing> CSS is my enemy lol
<Chrysalis> Buytoast if you put a little effort into it, programming isnt hard
<DocSane> Hey, everyone.
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: i'm a good programmer
<Dark92Enigma> ASoftFluffyThing: Michael Lil_B alexxm AJIsAwesome i'm fine, and......i told my dad i'm a brony. HE.......:O took it better than i expected
<Saturn> 08,01i'm also batman
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DocSane. :)
<Chrysalis> Saturn im an awesome programmer
<Amu-chan> Good, how are you doing?
<Buytoast> i've been putting effort into it and i suck more ass than a sucker fish at the grand canyon
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: i'm indian.
<Michael> hai DocSane
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Well, that's pretty good. :)
<DocSane> Anything planned for tonight?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Awesome, Dark92Enigma
<Chrysalis> damnit
<Buytoast> i'm, just giving up on it
<Meanwhile> Dark92Enigma: Apparently he, like most people, honestly don't care.
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma i assume that means it went well
<Chrysalis> you win Saturn
<Buytoast> maybe treat it like a hobby
<Lil_B> Chrysalis oh, ok I think i know now what they do, thanks (I'm just reallly intrerested in Audio)
<Saturn> 08,01at first i thought i was a failure
*Dark92Enigma hugs ASoftFluffyThing Michael Lil_B alexxm AJIsAwesome
<Saturn> 08,01because i suck at maths
<Saturn> 08,01i mean
<Chrysalis> Audio engineering is fun when you get to do the shows
<Chrysalis> usually its all the in built PA system
<Saturn> 08,01whoever heard of an Asian who sucks at maths?
*Michael hugs Dark92Enigma
*AJIsAwesome hugs Dark92Enigma back :)
<BoroBrony> i told my dad he was like cool i dont mind your still my son so i was like dam that was easy then i told my girlfriend i was a brony that was funny as hell LOL :D
<Chrysalis> which is a little dull
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: yes, it did........he also confessed me that he used to like doll houses
<Saturn> 08,01but then i discovered programming
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: when he was a kid
<Chrysalis> but when you get to do a proper system, then you see a famous person use it
<Chrysalis> its awesome
<ASoftFluffyThing> Anything more than basic math to me is eveil and comes from Math Hell.
<Chrysalis> though ill warn you
<alexxm> ok then Dark92Enigma
<ASoftFluffyThing> evil*
<Chrysalis> Basshunter is a little.. enthusiastic
<Chrysalis> in thanking engineers
<Saturn> 08,01i don't see why liking a cartoon show is such a big fucking deal that you need to "come out"
*Jmo nomths ASoftFluffyThing
<Saturn> 08,01with it
<Buytoast> it isn't Saturn
<Buytoast> but they have the need to make it like that
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm hell, he even reminded me that i played with Sailor Moon figures when i was little (i don't regret it :))
<Crystal> 6_9
<Kimori> doing ok thanks
<Meanwhile> People have this strange desire to make it seem like their lives matter.
<Buytoast> otherwise it doesn't make tehm special snowflakes
<Meanwhile> Fuck knows why.
*ASoftFluffyThing pokes Jmo
<Jmo> D:
<Saturn> 08,01my parents have known about ponies for ages; i didn't so much tell them, as it just worked its way into our conversations
<Brad[Laptop]> Saturn excellent comment :)
<Saturn> 08,01Friendship is Insidious
<Lil_B> Chrysalis I hope I can evolve like most people at the Uni... If I get that far, I really also finally wanna leanr how to Programm, the best educational system doesn't work if you are living your whole life a small Rural town
<Meanwhile> One meatbag is just as pointless as the next when you get down to it.
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: btw, how is it going with your parents?
<Buytoast> nobody is special
<Dark92Enigma> just asking :$
<Meanwhile> But people are weak and fragile and just can't exist without the idea that anyone gives a damn about them.
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: you mean, this isn't even your final form?
<Lil_B> Chrysalis sry , didn't wanted to write that much >.<
<Chrysalis> Lil_B i didnt actually change that much at uni
<Saturn> 08,01Dark92Enigma: quite well, actually
<Meanwhile> Go fgiure.
<Meanwhile> figure*
<Chrysalis> all i did was get better at what i do
<Spectrum_Rush> we're more bags of mostly water then meatbags
<Saturn> 08,01i went to uni
<Saturn> 08,01and became a hippy
<Brad[Laptop]> lol
<Michael> lawl
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: True, but waterbag doesn't have the same ring to it.
<Chrysalis> Lil_B Get a Raspberry pi and write a mini-game
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<Dark92Enigma> I'm ok with them
<BoroBrony> FUS RO DAH :D :D :D :P
<Saturn> 08,01you don't even need a raspberry pi
<Chrysalis> or look at tutorials
<Saturn> 08,01download python and pygame
<Chrysalis> Saturn shhh
<Saturn> 08,01write a game
<Saturn> 08,01easy
<Chrysalis> we need everyone to get pi's
<Lil_B> Chrysalis I can't write a single line of code... except Filter rules for Adhunter...
<Chrysalis> then we can say there is pi everywhere
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: what are we, the pi mafia?
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: touchê
<Vivix> I learned as a teenager by messing around with c++
<Saturn> 08,01it should be a Raspberry Tau, anyway...
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Touché.
<Buytoast> just read some books
<Chrysalis> The first rule of pi mafia
<Chrysalis> you DO NOT TALK about pi mafia
*ASoftFluffyThing is lost now
<Spectrum_Rush> DAMN YOU KEYBOARD
<Buytoast> i gave up on an academic career with programming, but i'm still learning with books
<Chrysalis> Rule 2: GoTo Rule 1
<Buytoast> books are your freinds you know
<Saturn> 08,01okay everypony
<Brad[Laptop]> I dont think I could ever do programming commercially, but as a hobby its great.
<Lil_B> Saturn Chrysalis I wish I could build a Mp3 Player out of the Pi that can play any format and has a lot of Memory
<Socks> My dad works for the dude who developed the Rasberry Pi :P
<Brad[Laptop]> Lil_B you can.
<Saturn> 08,01from now on, i'm going to refer to the Raspberry Pi as the Raspberry Tau/2
<Socks> He's called Jack
<Chrysalis> Lil_B you could
<Socks> and is rather short
<Michael> darn i'm bored
<Meanwhile> I have no idea what all this pi stuff is.
<Saturn> 08,01because that's what it is
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile ultra cheap low power computer
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, I don't either.
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: buy rapsberry pi, buy batteries, but in a huge SD card
<MaxTheBrony> Good night guys :)
<Chrysalis> its £30 for a full linux box
<Brad[Laptop]> Raspberry Pi isn't some amazing invention. It just takes what already exists and makes it accessible.
<Meanwhile> Night Max.
<Saturn> 08,01add screen, etc.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like programming, but I'm sure I want a career in it.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night MaxTheBrony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*not
<Michael> Gnight MaxTheBrony
<Amu-chan> I'm going to be idle for a bit. Later! XD
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: ya know what hilarious to do that é all i had to do was hit alt e then e
<AJIsAwesome> Night, MaxTheBrony. :)
<Michael> i love progamming
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Mm.
<Saturn> 08,01éek
<alexxm> bye MaxTheBrony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I liked making things as a kid too.
<alexxm> is there a stream on?
<Saturn> 08,01goddamnit, windows...
<Crystal_Pony> Bye!
<ASoftFluffyThing> I find it odd that I plan on building my own computer, but don't know a thing about programming and shit.
*Saturn 08,01is on his mother's compuer
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye Crystal_Pony
<Socks> That's not programming that's more electronics
<Vordox> Saturn can STREAM now!?
<Saturn> 08,01ASoftFluffyThing: they are completely disparate things
<Vivix> Don't need to know much to build a computer though
<Crystal_Pony> I'm not leaving i'm saying bye to soemone else :D
<Lil_B> Saturn yes, but still, I need to Programm for it... or at least I finally wanna be able to programm (I think I have talked about it too much already :/ ), and btw. I sincerely hope this isn't my final form yet xD
<Michael> Saturn: windows is bes OS (?)
<Brad[Laptop]> ASoftFluffyThing I used to be the opposite, knew a lot about software related things but nothing about hardware.
<Chrysalis> Vivix its not that hard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Put some parts together and install an OS. Easy.
<Buytoast> damn, i wish i had a knife
<Buytoast> or some pliers
<Chrysalis> conveniently all the ports are different shapes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's making a PC.
<Saturn> 08,01Michael: out! get out!
<Vivix> Yeah, I do ite verytime I need a new computer
<Buytoast> those would be nice too
<Socks> LINUX IS THE SUPERIOR BEING!
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<Michael> Saturn: xD
<Saturn> 08,01Socks: well, no, it's an operating system
<Michael> still remember the win98 crash
<Socks> No it is a being
<Shizuka> 13testing again
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> huh still no stream
<Saturn> 08,01bitch, it's a kernel
<Lil_B> I want Linux Mint or a light version of Ubuntu, and Dual Boot Windows for games
<Brad[Laptop]> Putting a computer together with consumer parts is pretty trivial. Everything plugs into one another where its supposed to go.
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i use Xubuntu
<BoroBrony> 10.30 is optimun dance starting time for russian dancing Pony :D :D
<Vivix> I was told that ArchLinux was favorable
<Saturn> 08,01because XFCE is <3
<Chrysalis> shizumobileblack screen atm
<Brad[Laptop]> archlinux is good.
<Vordox> I hear sound!
<shizumobile> Game or chrome
<Brad[Laptop]> You make it into what you want it to be.
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: whoever told you that clearly hates you
<Vivix> Hehe, maaybe~~ they were powernerds
<shizumobile> Neither.... Hrm
<Lil_B> Saturn I was thinking about Lubuntu, but I could try it
<Crystal_Pony> random creepy music
<Vordox> Hear sounds Shizuka but no image
<Meanwhile> Black screen.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ...ok apparently theres a dating sim where you date pigeons...PIGEONS?! :D
<Vivix> Its a romhack, kinda
<Socks> Well I better be going FTM bye all.
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: it's personal preference; i'm not a big fan of LXDE
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: YOu haven't known about that? :D
<Vivix> I wish it did date pidgeons-
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Socks. :)
<Michael> inmense hiatus right there
*Socks rides a lion off into the sunset
<Michael> bye Socks
<Crystal_Pony> Bye socks!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: no i just saw PBG's vid of it :D
<DocSane> And yet pony fans are somehow reviled.
<shizumobile> Phase lied to me about this being able to cap fullscreen games...
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: pigeons are delicious
<Meanwhile> ^
<Saturn> 08,01i'm getting a couple to cook at christmas
<ASoftFluffyThing> brb
<Lil_B> Saturn I'll try it, I have a small Virtual Box Setup , because I don't wanna dive headfirst into it :P
<Vivix> Last linux I used was Mandrake on KDE, needless to say, I'm so out of the loop
<Vordox> I saw an image now!
<Vivix> D=!
<Crystal_Pony> And sometimes, they come with notes attatched :'(
<Vivix> Oh well, there's enough pigeons to go around, I suppose
<Shizuka> 13that would have been chrome
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: i started out on Lindows, of all things
<Brad[Laptop]> The last linux I used was ubuntu on my old laptop like 5 years ago before I accidentially formatted it.
<Saturn> 08,01this was about 10 years ago
<DocSane> Ubuntu looks so weird these days.
<Saturn> 08,01then i tried Mandrake
<Vivix> Lindows? Never heard of O.o
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: now called Linspire
<Meanwhile> Never heard of that either.
<Vivix> Ah, Mandrake was my father|s favourite, so I used that, did try some red |hat, but th|ey kinda vanished
<Lil_B> I used ReactOS once, but the person who told me about it kinda Lied :/
<Saturn> 08,01it was trying to be the easiest to use Linux distro
<Saturn> 08,01heh, ReactOS is a great idea
<Chrysalis> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1px2zhocI1qbrjx2o1_400.gif
<Vivix> I had a friend, who changed distro once a week, he had no programs because he spent most of his time formatting and reformatting
<Saturn> 08,01FOSS, windows binary compatible OS
<AJIsAwesome> Chrysalis: :D
<Lil_B> Vordox oh, btw have you seen the vid now or not? I would really like to show it to you :P
<Crystal_Pony> Chrysalis, Obama's got some swag
<Chrysalis> AJIsAwesome ikr
<Vordox> Lil_B: Kinda crunching Unity3D atm
<Vivix> The only other OS I remember from childhood is O/S2
<Crystal_Pony> :D Swag!
<Lil_B> Vordox np
<Vivix> well, that and Amiga os
<Lil_B> I know someone who bought a really old Machine for Analysis and had to use OS/2 to run it xD
<DocSane> I was using an Amiga 4000 up till 2000.
<Vordox> Lil_B: Unless you know Unity3D scripting :P
<Lil_B> Amiga OS still exists... Amiga OS 4.1 come out one ort 2 years ago
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Vivix> We had Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200, and MZ Sharp 700 (I think), Commodore 64 and 64C(I thiink)-
<Vivix> growing up with nerds
<Lil_B> Vordox I couldn't even stript 1D
<DocSane> Lil_B: It's a nice thought, but I came to terms with Amiga's death years ago.
<Lil_B> why do I had to group up on a farmers viallage >.<
<BoroBrony> ☭ ☭ ☭
<Vivix> Fiirst OC I remember was windows 3.11
<Vivix> OS*
<Lil_B> grow*
<Saturn> 08,01new amiga: http://www.technobuffalo.com/desktops/commodore-launches-new-amiga-gaming-pc-alongside-a-c64-remake/
<Lil_B> BoroBrony I dare you to use the other Symbols you find in that Font
<DocSane> First computer I ever used for real was a Commodore PET.
<Vivix> I hearda bout that, but isn't it more or less completely unrelated to the old machines?
<Michael> wow
<BoroBrony> hell no Lil_B
<Lil_B> BoroBrony good
<Vivix> Commodore PET? Hn, never tried one of those
<Vivix> I was--5-6 at the time
<diddutz> Anyone here having experience on SSD drives not showing up at boot configuration in bios?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Didn't know Commodore was still in business.
<BoroBrony> am not into that stuff Lil_B i was born in germany and have been called all sorts by people because i am aryan
<Saturn> 08,01the first operating system i used was CP/M
<Vivix> They were purchased by somebody
<Saturn> 08,01on an Intertec Superbrain
<Saturn> 08,01used a zilog z80 processor
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord they did filed bankrupcy in 94 actually, that surprises me too...
<Vivix> I think some german compy bought the logo and name
<DocSane> Commodore PET was the immediate predecessor of the Vic 20. Was an all-in-one: green screen monitor, tape drive, and keyboard in a beige wedge.
<Saturn> 08,01for comparison: the z80 is the chip that the Sega Genesis used as its sound processor
<Vivix> ohh tape drive
<Lil_B> BoroBrony and I am a full German :/
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Vivix> We used to put our Commodore tapes in the taperecorder for funny noises
<DocSane> Had a staggering 8K or RAM running on a .5 MHz processor.
<Michael> hai GilDash
<MadSurge> GilDash! :$
<BoroBrony> hello GilDash
<Lil_B> hey GilDash :)
<Meanwhile> 'Lo GilDash.
<Michael> so much computing, i like it!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, GilDash. :)
<Vivix> Saturn computer world moves crazy fast
<Saturn> 08,01also, if anyone owns a TI graphing calculator of TI-83 or above, and below a TI-89, it uses a zilog Z80 CPU
<Vivix> It's--bizarre to think about
<Stormy`> why the hell did I buy these shoes :<
<Stormy`> they are evil
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've used a TI-89.
<BoroBrony> Lil_B aesome i lived there for 14 years because my dad was posted there for the british army
<Amu-chan> What kind of shoes are they?
<Saturn> 08,01the TI-89 uses a motorola M68000 processor
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Actually, I own a broken one.
<DocSane> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi GilDash.
<Saturn> 08,01this is the same processor as the Genesis used as its main processor
<Lil_B> BoroBrony awesome, I thought only american people were stationed here
<Saturn> 08,01also, it's the same processor used by the first macintosh
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Holla! :)
<DocSane> Oh, sorry. It has 4K and a 1 MHz 6502 CPU.
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: i own a TI-89 Titanium
<Stormy`> boots with a one-inch heel
<Saturn> 08,01i've harly ever used it
<GilDash> Tech talk... I expect I'll be lost before long.
<Saturn> 08,01i learned assembly on a 6502 based machine
<MadSurge> GilDash, dahling: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/1f6afa1308136e1377bcb528b1dfa187.jpg :3
<Lil_B> almost every 8-Bit Machine used the 6502 as far as I know
<Vivix> Assembly? Now that's something that always scared me away from coding
<Amu-chan> Oh, what is specifically bugging you with them?
<Saturn> 08,01it was a very popular chip
<GilDash> MadSurge: She certainly looks ready for action. ;)
<Stormy`> I'm not used to heels at all so they always kill my feet >_>
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: assembly is actually dead easy
<Saturn> 08,01unless you're doing x86 assmeply
<Vivix> That's what they say- it probably is if I tryy, but- it looks daunting
<MadSurge> GilDash: I know she's you're favorite :)
<Sonny> hey there everypony
<MadSurge> *your
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: if you want to learn assembly, learn MIPS32 assembly
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai Sonny
<GilDash> MadSurge: You'd better believe it. Dashie's awesome. :)
<MadSurge> Wb Sonny!
<Saturn> 08,01it's still used, and it's dead easy to learn
<Stormy`> It's like all the pressure goes to the ball of my foot
<Sonny> :D thanks
<BoroBrony> Lil_B nope more britsh than american but most of the britsh have left because our peace-keeping duty was over i still dont know how drivng a tank in the streets is peace-keeping lol i was in munster and was born in padderborn :D :D
<Michael> hai Sonny
<Sonny> hi there Michael
<Lil_B> well, I guess one thing that came out of the Country life is that I may know Gardening and Crops better than other Nerds
<alexxm> how are things Sonny
<alexxm> is there a stream
<Sonny> not bad at the moment alexxm
<Vivix> Maybe- I wouldn't mind messing around with more stuff
<Amu-chan> I know, heels can be so painful.
<Sonny> don't think so
<Lil_B> hey Sonny!
<GilDash> To be fair, if you're driving a tank they'd have to be mad to attack you... that would keep the peace faily well.
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: ha! yes, i can sympathise with you there...
<Vivix> I was always fascinated by the step like- how programming languages are made, how you create them, but I never learned about it
<GilDash> *fairly
<Stormy`> All my other shoes are so ugly though =.
<Stormy`> *=/
*Saturn 08,01grew up in a tiny village in the scottish countryside
<Sonny> hey Lil_B :D
<Saturn> 08,01how the hell did ibecome an utter nerd...
<Stormy`> They're dirty and covered in salt from last winter
<Vivix> Sunshine and sci-fi movies
<Amu-chan> It doesn't help me that my ankles are like jello, and give out randomly while I'm walking in heels.
<Michael> or gaming
<Stormy`> So of course I had to pick heeled ones to replace them XD
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, the height of technological adancement where i grew up was generally using top-bar hives instead of the dome ones...
<Lil_B> Saturn I got an CD qwith an Emulator and a ton of old games... that got me interrested :P
<Stormy`> Yeah, that happens to me too <_<
<Vivix> Everyone in my family of the gender male are nerds
<Amu-chan> My ankles give out randomly anyway, but with heels especially.
<Bronysith> YAY NERDS
<Vivix> but- I'm interested in programming and computer, but- I guess I fell out of the nerd crowd ages ago-
<Saturn> 08,01i want some honey
<Saturn> 08,01brb
<GilDash> I've not had honey in ages.
<Michael> my parents are nerds
<Vivix> I don't know enough about it, I know how to build code without--tutorials and stuff, but that's about it
<DocSane> I ate an enormous steak and cheese sub for lunch and dinner.
<Stormy`> Maybe these are for people who sit at desks all day and don't walk around too much
<Vivix> nerd parents are fun
<DocSane> I don't think I'll be able to get to the gym tonight. (*BLARG*)
<Lil_B> Vivix how? how can one learn to code without a tutorial?
<Vivix> Hm?
<Michael> Vivix: IKR?
<Amu-chan> Sometimes better looking shoes come at a price, sadly.
<Vivix> Well I got a lot of the patterning from Cpp, but for JS I ask people when I'm stuck, and read up on W3C definitions
<Vivix> that's about it
<Stormy`> Yeah :(
<Lil_B> ...I think I should gom out and plant potatoes...
<Vivix> I do read articles to understand Arrays and such- because that baffled me, and I did read a tut on drawengines to see--what was normal
<Michael> Lil_B: then make some chips from the potatoes
<Vivix> but once you get commands and definitions and the--basic flow down, you just think "how do I solve this"-- it comes a bit easier
<Vivix> JS is easy though, I guess
<Vivix> Hard to master, but easy to--begin with?
<Lil_B> all I can do is **div[id*="adv"] and similar Stuff to black ads or block whatever else I want
<Vivix> aah
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350896578982.png dat luna pony tail
<shizumobile> How about now
<Michael> :o
<Vivix> I started learning java script about two months ago to make a paintchat without plugins-
<Spitfire> who's streaming? o 3o
<Lil_B> Michael I'm currently growing 16-Bit Potatoes to get some Blast Processing
<Meanwhile> Oh look, it finally worked.
<Buytoast> oh, is this Goldeneye for the Wii?
<shizumobile> Actually working?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep
<Spectrum_Rush> yuss
<Meanwhile> Looks like it.
<shizumobile> Yay
<shizumobile> How's quality
<Derpy_Hooves> who's the streamer
<Meanwhile> Pretty good.
<BoroBrony> Bronysith luna is awesome :D :D
<AJIsAwesome> Shizu is
<shizumobile> I have no preview here so
<Buytoast> this looks like a pretty wierd version of Goldeneye
<Amu-chan> I couldn't possibly wear stilettos, my ankles and feet would be dead by the end of the day. XD
<Buytoast> is this one of those russian hack things?
<Meanwhile> Can read the text on the news bulletin easy enough.
<MadSurge> BoroBrony: but so is Celestia. :P
<Michael> yay cars
<Lil_B> Bronysith how can Luna get a Ponytail? Her Hair looks like Purple Plasma
<Buytoast> wait a second
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Agreed.
<shizumobile> Let's see how it does
<Buytoast> WAIT A SECOND
<Buytoast> this isn't Goldeneye
<Michael> Lil_B: like this? http://i.imgur.com/pjj6z.jpg
<BoroBrony> true MadSurge true you speak words of wizdom :D :D
<Buytoast> I didn;t know there was Knightrider game
<DocSane> Need For Speed
<Stormy`> Yeah, I thought these would be okay since they're not like that
<Buytoast> quick, make the robot jump the car
<MadSurge> Michael: that looks like something Derpy or Pinkie would be able to do :D
<Meanwhile> Turn into Optimus Prime and fight Megatron.
<Stormy`> Do people just train themselves to wear them, or are they always this painful?
<Sumica> 00,10rendered with mario paint
<Michael> MadSurge: because potato is best external drive
<Lil_B> Michael you know what they say, the dumbest Farmers grow the biggesdt Potatoes, and mine can hold a 1TB
<MadSurge> BoroBrony: I like both princesses. :)
<DocSane> Having flashbacks tot he early days of streaming video
<Meanwhile> Rendered with lego.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: its like one of those mosaics made of a buncha pics
<MadSurge> Michael: just keep it in the fridge to avoid it rotting
<BoroBrony> same here MadSurge but i am more luna republic :D :D
<Amu-chan> I think someone who wears them a lot might not notice the pain as much, but I think heels are generally universally painful...
<shizumobile> So verdict is fuzzy
<Meanwhile> Yeah when it gets active it goes giant pixels.
<pony_3699> Hello everyone :)
<Spectrum_Rush> only when moving Shizuka
<Michael> hai pony_3699
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, pony_3699. :)
<Meanwhile> It's great as long as not much is happening. Which kinda goes against the point.
<Sumica> 00,10it's handeling the compression suppriseingly well thought
<BoroBrony> hello pony_3699 :)
<Lil_B> Sumica Mario Paint Rocks
<shizumobile> K let's see what I can do
<shizumobile> Unbearable?
<pony_3699> Im new here :) How do you change your name?
<Meanwhile> It doesn't lag or tear it's just...blocky.
<Vivix> slash nick
<AJIsAwesome> pony_3699: Use /nick and enter your new nick :)
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Michael> pony_3699: Welcome to Bronystate, type /nick
<Sumica> 00,10it's not too bad realy
<DocSane> Is there no way to increase the bit rate of the encoder?
<Princess> s
<shizumobile> Will try that, sec
<Sumica> 00,10would need to up the keyframe intervals
<shizumobile> Also I think you should see pic when I alt tab
<Amu-chan> At least that's what I think. Considering feet aren't naturally that shape, I find it hard to imagine someone would find heels comfortable.
<Kimori> Do you have to wear boots Stormy` ?
<Meanwhile> That one tart from NGE. Yeah.
<Shizuka> 13oh ffsplit was still running 1440, dxtory is outputting 640
<MadSurge> :O Asuka!
<Shizuka> 13ffsplit was probably trying to scale up then squish back down for mips
<Stormy`> I don't have to; I just liked how they looked
<RD> What happening on Friday?
<DashWithRainbows> Much better now, Shizu.
<Stormy`> Now I'm thinking about just wearing tennis shoes every day :P
<DocSane> etter
<DocSane> Better
<shana> 640x900 video?
<Michael> nice!
<shizumobile> Yay
<Chrysalis> hey Shizuka can i add you on NFS?
<Meanwhile> Yeah that's significant improvement.
<DocSane> Now we can sort of see what's happening
<shizumobile> KamiShizuka is me unfound
<Sonny> Is Nittany_Discord here?
<DocSane> 'Scuse me a moment, folks. I have to go drag a kayak under my back porch.
<Sonny> well is he?
<Sonny> I need to ask him somthing :3

<Sonny> oh ye
<Sonny> ok
<Jmo> How to PM
<shizumobile> Pop quiz.... How do I accepted invite...
<Jmo> teach meh ashie-poo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Sonny.
<Meanwhile> Newfoals can't PMforce.
<DashWithRainbows> Joomay
<Sonny> hi Nittany_Discord
<DashWithRainbows> 1st
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: More Information on the MLP Gameloft Game
<Sumica> 00,10outputing 640 is fine Shizuka, it is the embed size
<DashWithRainbows> u delete system 32
<Sumica> 00,10it's matching emputs you need to do
<Jmo> omai.
<DashWithRainbows> then rub a strong magnet on the side of your computer
<Lil_B> 1/230 of work done... let's move over too my presentation about mercury :/ (the element)
<Sonny> I was wondering if you'd like your oc to do anything specific :p? Nittany_Discord
<GilDash> Lil_B: Hg?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<Lil_B> GilDash gesundheit
<shizumobile> Yeah they're all matched now sumi
<GilDash> Lil_B: Mercury. Chemical symbol Hg.
<Lil_B> GilDash yes, sry I was in a yardfools mood :P
<Sonny> Nittany_Discord: alright, do I need to give him that jacket that was displayed in the picture as well? or any cloths?
<Kimori> some tennis shoes can look nice >.>
<Amu-chan> That may be the way to go. Although if you want nice looking shoes, you could always consider flats.
<Sonny> I was gonna add the jacket to it
<Sonny> but I wasn't sure if you'd like that or not
<Stormy`> Actually I tend to avoid flats because they give me blisters on the backs of my heels :(
<Cades> Looking for shoes Stormy?
<Lil_B> btw Sonny how did the picture end up?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He normally doesn't wear the vest, but you're OK with drawing him wearing that.
<Amu-chan> Oh, that sucks.
<Sonny> sure ^^
<Kimori> You know I was going to say that it does..
<Amu-chan> I guess tennis shoes it is then.
<Sonny> Lil_B: wich one?
<Stormy`> Yep XD, kind of limits what I can wear I guess
<Kimori> awww
<Lil_B> Sonny the one you were working on when I and Adam were in the chat
<Sonny> oh that one
<Sonny> it's on deviantart
<Sonny> want the link?
<Phase4> urgh, looks like someone hacked minecraft.com
<Stormy`> Cades, kind of, these ones that I bought yesterday are just kind of evil :P
<Phase4> derp

<Phase4> which is incredibly anoying
<Stormy`> These http://maur.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pMAUR1-12838696v275.jpg
<Cades> ah
<Phase4> no... https://minecraft.net/ nvm
<Phase4> how he crap did i get to this page then
<DashWithRainbows> It seems that Shizu is chasing the latest person to dislike Vi's wubs.
<Amu-chan> Those do look nice... Though... XD
<Stormy`> that's probably a bit higher than an inch actually...
<DashWithRainbows> Justice will be served :3

<DashWithRainbows> U HAPPY NAO, JOOMAY?
<cachi01> Saturn: Sprite/Lemon ice cream
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i have no idea what fruity soda is
<Vordox> Saturn: Fanta, Zingo, Sprite, etc

<Vordox> Saturn: ..Fanta Exotic or Fanta, or Zingo, Any of those soda with Fruity taste.
<Meanwhile> 20 seconds. Destroyed much.

<Dken2021> ooh, I could go for a fanta
<Saturn> 08,01this is going to end badly
<Vordox> Saturn: And mix it up with any ice cream
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile All because of that incredible hit into the wall
<cachi01> Saturn: rompope/vanilla
<Vordox> Saturn: And you'll be in heaven for about 1 hour :P
<Meanwhile> DWR: Indeed.
<Coldays> yea fanta would be nice right about now
<Vivix> I've done this with coca cola and vanilla icecream, HORRIBLE mistake- but maybe it'll work with fruity
<Vordox> Vivix: NEVER WITH COLA
<Vordox> Cola is yucky
<Vivix> IT WAS HORRIBLE ;__;
<Saturn> 08,01i think the icecream would curdle and make bits that float to the top of the glass
<Vordox> You need something with..."TASTE":P
<Vivix> It did, in cola's case
<Stormy`> I am really unclear about where the line is between normal and "prostitute boots" :P
<Vivix> it like, seperated
*Vivix speaks like silverspoon
<Vordox> Saturn: The ice cream would actually become like fluffy =3
<Vivix> that sounds delishous-
<Vordox> Saturn: The soda seeps into the ice cream making it softer and even drinkable.
<Vivix> wow-spelling
<Stormy`> Like, I guess if they're black and go up to your knees and have like 3 inches of heel they would look like that
<Vordox> Saturn: And after that... eat up =3
<Coldays> good choice
<cachi01> look at dem fancy cars i cant afford
<Michael> lamborghini :)
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: not sure if trust
<Saturn> 08,01but i'll try it

<cachi01> crysis everywhere
<oni_link> dat turtle
<Meanwhile> I'm not that familiar with the physics of parachuting, give me a break.
<alexxm> shot the turtle
<ASoftFluffyThing> I've never played crysis
<RoboGerbil> more shipping than a ups store
<Coldays> turtle
<oni_link> NUUUU
<AJIsAwesome> NOO
<thelonepony> Turtle :3
<Coldays> noo
<cachi01> PICK UP TURTLE
<thelonepony> D:
<Meanwhile> Why would you do that to Tank.
<cachi01> xdddd
<cachi01> XDDDDDDDDDDDD
<TheMaster> "The terminal velocity of this skydiver is about 124 mph (200 kph)."
<TheMaster> there
<MadSurge> MAXIMUM TURTLE
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/WjY44.png
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Stop being mean to the turtle
<otakon> and TOSS it
<TheMaster> so about 124 miles per hour is still pretty hard to hit the water
<Coldays> why you throw da turtle
<otakon> Poor Tank
<ASoftFluffyThing> RoboGerbil, more shipping than DHS, UPS and FedEx in a shipping contest to see who ships faster and better?
<shizumobile> MAXIMUM PONY
<MadSurge> ^
<Meanwhile> At least flip him back over.
<DocSane> Crysis?
<Domo> The turtle wanted to fly
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Whats the fatal velocity for humans?
<Coldays> shizumobile lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Wait, what's this about a turtle?
<otakon> Yes
<otakon> a turtle named Tank and his quest to stop aliens
<Domo> Shizu helped a turtle fly
<Lil_B> Well, I guess I'll say goodbye too the chat, now, I don't think I'm going to write that much more befor I fakll asleep :P
<Kandarihu> ASoftFluffyThing, she found a turtle and threw it
<otakon> which was thwarted when he was thrown into the sea by Nomad
<Meanwhile> Timber.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye Lil_B
<Coldays> faild by the hands of this guy
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And is it just me or is each crysis game going BACKWARDS in technology?
<oni_link> MMMM dat destructibility
<Domo> Night, Lil_B
<thelonepony> Night Lil_B :)
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: how so?
<otakon> night Lil_B
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, why you throw turtle? :<
<Coldays> bye Lil_B
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Lil_B. :)
<oni_link> Was this before the frostbite engine?
<Lil_B> ... my expiriment just showed: with uncoherent noises in the backgrouind, the writing ability does decrease
<oni_link> I cant recall
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's a mine turtle.
<TheMaster> you reach terminal velocity in about 14 seconds
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well crysis 3 or two has a bow instead of a gun
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: MINE TURTLE
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: hello!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nittany_Discord, it's still a turtle.
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: HELLO~
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[School]: 3.
<otakon> also Bronysith funny story
<Coldays> 3
<Major> Nittany_Discord ah! where?!
<Bronysith> otakon: what funny story?
*Lil_B hugs ASoftFluffyThing Domo thelonepony otakon Coldays and AJIsAwesome <3
<cachi01> Bronysith: lol......brb going to 9gag
*AJIsAwesome hugs Lil_B back :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> stop being jerks to the trees
<Meanwhile> You know I could be wrong but I'm not sure if lumberjacking was in the mission parametres.
<Bronysith> and suddenly smugness in chat
<Saturn> 08,01????
<otakon> Bronysith: the legend of 9gag
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, a Mine Turtle ought to be equippable... and only part of an absurd DLC
<Bronysith> cachi01: stay there
*ASoftFluffyThing huggles Lil_B back
<TheMaster> I call shenannigans. what are you using, .80 caliber bullets? you couldn't possibly shoot a tree over doing that
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I loved the Freelance astronaut run of this, so hilarious
<Bronysith> otakon: ahh okay
<otakon> dammit now I want to play this
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Maximun pun
<cachi01> Bronysith: i'll be back with LINKS
<Saturn> 08,01my god
<Saturn> 08,01fuck this noise
<oni_link> Meanwhile: its the SOP in that area, ELIMINATE TREES
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos
<Bronysith> cachi01: never clicking em
<SpadeMagnes[School]> cachi01: Ganon better watch out
<otakon> except all I have access to is the LIVE and PSN versions
<Coldays> i dont know how to talk in 3rd person:'(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm done with EA cynicism Kandarihu. It never got me anywhere.
<otakon> which I heard were inferior
<Meanwhile> oni_link: Trees are just waiting for the right moment to strike. So we'll go in pre-emptively.
<oni_link> HAHAH
*cachi01 knows how to talk in 3rd person
*Saturn 08,01is listening to Evelyn Evelyn
<sub06905> ello everypony :)
<otakon> hiya sub06905
<thelonepony> Hi sub06905 :)
<cachi01> hi sub06905 :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What did the trees ever do to you man!
<oni_link> I wub cloak
<RoboGerbil> you can blow apart trees in crysis
<TheMaster> this isn't really fair to the koreans
<sub06905> we watching Crysis?
<Coldays> hi sub06905
<cachi01> nope
<cachi01> CoD
<oni_link> sub06905: yup
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, sorry. I just found it ironic that after 76 hours of indie game love, I come back to EA.
<oni_link> LOL
<sub06905> is this that halo cod mod :D
<TheMaster> hardcore super advanced u.s. special forces with more gadgets than gordon freeman vs. starving north koreans with ak-47s
<cachi01> Kandarihu: its an awesome game now enjoy!
<cachi01> sub06905: :D
<oni_link> MMMM AK
<Kandarihu> cachi01, I'm not complaining. I know it's an awesome game.
<cachi01> TheMaster: lol
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Crysis AKA the game to see how well your computer can play games
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just that it's cool to hate EA.
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[School]: BENCHMARK: THE GAME
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do remember that.
<Bronysith> i think im going
<Coldays> i agree with Discord
<Meanwhile> Now it's cool to say you don't hate EA.
<Bronysith> to set something on fire
<RoboGerbil> crysis is really old, but its weird how people still use it as a benchmark
*Domo goes to find a blanket
<oni_link> RoboGerbil: its still very demanding, age aside
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was a graphically-intensive PC game at the time.
<TheMaster> oh god. its the smoke monster from LOST!
<Major> Nittany_Discord I remember when EA was actually cool.... good times :(
<oni_link> NOOOO not the smoke monster D:
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well he died
<Bronysith> EA ever cool?
<Bronysith> yea no
<otakon> once
<otakon> long long ago
<oni_link> ^
<Meanwhile> Once upon a time.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> otakon: IN A DISTANT LAND
<otakon> when they were called Electronic Artists
<AJIsAwesome> In a distand land,
<RoboGerbil> in a galaxy far far away
<MadSurge> Oh by the way, ALIENS
<cachi01> but then the fire nation attacked otakon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA went from hated to "Better than Activision." to hated again.
<Bronysith> otakon: and were actually run by gamers?
<otakon> and they made M.U.L.E.
<sub06905> NFS:HP2 <3
<Petrified_Discord> I tore open a poral in time...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Before then, nothing much.
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: :D
<otakon> Bronysith: electronic artists they called themselves
<shizumobile> Quality still good ja?
<oni_link> Nittany_Discord: how did that happen?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<alexxm> is this a predator game
<TheMaster> EA ruined west wood, bioware and many other companies
<Coldays> im confused on this chat right now:P
<TheMaster> death to EA
<otakon> Shizuka: pretty good, kind of dark though
<TheMaster> westwood especially...
<TheMaster> they'll never make a NOX sequel
<TheMaster> ;-;
<otakon> and Bioware is circling the drain
*RoboGerbil used to love westwood AND bioware
<shizumobile> Think I found me my new favorite stream setup :3
<otakon> Mass Effect 4 is gonna blow
<cachi01> otakon: oh come on some of their games are good. crysis 1 and 2 and SXX for example
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Theres gonna be a fucking 4?
<shizumobile> BOO!
<fluttershyftw16> just because im excited MLP FIM SEASON 3 IS ON NOV. 10 AT 10:00am
<otakon> shizumobile: so full power to PC and you on mobile?
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: eeyup
<shizumobile> Yup
<otakon> THE HELL HAPPENED TO HIM!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> HI DER
<Coldays> tries to talk in 3rd person
<cachi01> JUMPSCARES ERHMAGERD
<Coldays> fail
<Meanwhile> Oh hey it's Predator.
<cachi01> AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<alexxm> does this game remind anyone else of predator
<TheMaster> its a very busy weekend. The presidential election AND my litlte pony?
<Barb|RoninPony> The tickle monster killed him
<SpadeMagnes[School]> ERMERGERD AZERTERK IS DERD
<Barb|RoninPony> That explains his face.
<TheMaster> also pff, doom 3 is way scarier with its jump scares
<Meanwhile> Implying jump scares are actually scary.
<otakon> TheMaster: huh? no
<otakon> damn WHAT?!
<Coldays> poor guy
<Saturn> 08,01TheMaster: my god, it's a conspiracy!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Instant vaporising
<oni_link> No tags?? :(
<otakon> he was already dead
<cachi01> TheMaster: screw the elections we have ponies
<MadSurge> TheMaster: and you know which event is more important!
<otakon> What ponies this weekend?
<Meanwhile> So is it lagging during heavy movement for anyone else?
<TheMaster> remember to vote for vermin supreme
<otakon> Meanwhile: yh a bit
<TheMaster> so that we can all have our very own pony
<MadSurge> otakon: november 10th!
<Meanwhile> Thought it might be.
<Coldays> still creamated from a tree is brutal
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: A little.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Twilight for rpedisdent
<cachi01> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 18 days, 16 hours, 41 minutes, 41 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
<cachi01> yay
<Sonny> well
<Sonny> gtg
<Sonny> Nittany_Discord:
<cachi01> cya Sonny :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bye Sonny :)
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Sonny. :)
<oni_link> bye Sonny
<Sonny> I've already drawn the base and stuff
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes Sonny?
<crazypony> bye Sonny
<Sonny> It'll be done by saterday
<Sonny> bye :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ow.
<Meanwhile> What? I find you.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> MAXIMUM EVERYTHING
<TheMaster> so according to Hasbro...queens=evil. princesses=good. what does that make emperors and empresses?
<oni_link> oh wow that rifle sounded good.
<Meanwhile> Maximum overdrive.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> TheMaster: Blame disney
<cachi01> TheMaster: masters of good evilness
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheMaster: It's more according to Disney.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They cemented the whole queens are evil shit
<Major> ^
<String_Shredder> Maximum ALL the things!
<Coldays> MAXIMUM PONY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Princess Celestia is legally a queen.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But logicly if NO ONE IS ABOVE YOU IN RANK you should be king/queen
<TheMaster> technically you'd get a lot of unfortunate implications if both celestia and Luna were queens together
<Major> Then.....what makes the king?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But they'll never call her Queen Celestia unless she goes evil.'
<cachi01> Major: slave
<Saturn> 08,01well
*Domo has a blanket now
<fluttershyftw16> king should be shining armour
<TheMaster> since its a diarchy I suppose its okay if they're both princess'
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a queen
<fluttershyftw16> right?
<oni_link> Nittany_Discord: that would be an interesting episode
<Saturn> 08,01so techincally, i outrank cleestia.
<LunasGuard> ello everypony
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im just gonna bullshit here and say she prefers to be called princess..for..I dont know
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi LunasGuard
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, LunasGuard. :)
<oni_link> lol you would Saturn XD
<thelonepony> Hi LunasGuard :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya LunasGuard :)
<cachi01> hi LunasGuard :)
<alexxm> how are things LunasGuard
<Domo> Hi LunasGuard
<Pink3> Hallo LunasGuard
<Coldays> i belive it Saturn
<Pink3> kewl name Domo
<Saturn> 08,01hey LunasGuard
<TheMaster> i'd argue that celestia is called princess because of the power sharing between her and Luna. They couldn't both be queens, this isn't Narnia
<Coldays> hi LunasGuard
<alexxm> SpadeMagnes[School] perhaps it makes her feel young and she likes conserding shes at least a few thousand years old
<RoboGerbil> and now shizu set off all the alarms... you can go through that base with strength and just knock everyone out
<Domo> Pink3: Lol thanks x3
<cachi01> TheMaster: wait.....it isnt?
<CriticKitten> Saturn: Until they appoint her as "Super Queen".
<TheMaster> no talking lions
<Petrified_Discord> Maximum Queen
<TheMaster> more specifically. No talking jesus lions
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Maximum Wubs
<LunasGuard> x10 hellos in a row a new record
<cachi01> TheMaster: LOL
<Pink3> SATUUUURRRNN! How can u say that u youreself are more powerful than the mighty CELETSIAAAA!!!!!! :O
<Coldays> FAil
<Kandarihu> I guess the connotation that Hasbro has taken is that Princess = Good royalty figure who is at peace with everyone. Queen = Bad royalty figure who is only at peace with her own subjects. What would an Empress be? Perhaps a VERY evil royalty figure who oppresses her own subjects
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You know why she's called princess?
<Meanwhile> Those guys have pretty good aim.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Marketing
<LunasGuard> this must be crysis
<Petrified_Discord> Fire one silenced bullet from behind cover = enemy instantly fires on your position
<cachi01> Kandarihu: dat or just a girl living in a cardboard box
<TheMaster> and here I was hoping that Celestia could become the God Empress of Ponykind
<Coldays> indeed Crysis
<oni_link> Holy crap Logitech makes the best universal remotes
<Kandarihu> cachi01, huh? What's that a reference to?
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: but what about a king? Would he be evil too?
<fluttershyftw16> king would be shining armour right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn, you don't look like a queen.
<Meanwhile> TheMaster: Adeptes Ponystartes.
<TheMaster> Kings don't have the evil connotation I think.
<oni_link> BOOM
<TheMaster> Mufasa was king in the...lion king
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: you've never seen me naked.
<cachi01> kings usually die
<Petrified_Discord> People usually die
<cachi01> they die being good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I don't want to.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Since Cadence is a princess, does that make Twilight royalty?
<cachi01> Petrified_Discord: dying is too mainstream
<CriticKitten> People die when they are killed. Except when they don't.
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, I don't think gender really affects things much.
<fluttershyftw16> or if clestia has a secret husband (good idea for epiosode)
<TheMaster> twilight is royalty-in law
<cachi01> fluttershyftw16: no
<cachi01> no
<Petrified_Discord> cachi01: What would you call someone that was a hipster before it was mainstream?
<shizumobile> Scootalooooooooo
<RoboGerbil> oni_link: ive never been impressed with logitek wireless devices, they often have a fault where the wireless only works when it wants to
<Coldays> lol
<AVS619> THROW IT
<SpadeMagnes[School]> CHICKENS
<alexxm> throw the scootaloo
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I love chickens eddy!
<Meanwhile> I love chickens Eddy.
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: well, the only prince we saw so far certainly wasn't very nice :D
<cachi01> Petrified_Discord: i would call it......*mindblown*
<TheMaster> Unless Twilights family is aristocracy themselves. Then again they've never taken the time to explain pony society
<TheMaster> CHICKENS!
<AVS619> lol
<oni_link> RoboGerbil: really? Ive yet to have that problem, even with this old Harmony remote.
<LunasGuard> dat scootaloo
<TheMaster> arise chicken, chicken arise. Summon super ultra chicken
<Meanwhile> Don't be mean to the chicken! Chickens are nice!
<Coldays> you throw turtles and scootaloos?
<cachi01> Coldays: to koreans yes
<Petrified_Discord> MadSurge: I would bring up the S3 deal but you know...spoilers :/
<TheMaster> oh hey, its HALO now
<SpadeMagnes[School]> FUCK TREES
<oni_link> Screw the environment!!
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, well Shining Armor married into the royalty, right? Or did Cadence marry out of it?
<Coldays> noo they will eat them
<MadSurge> Now jump off a ledge and use it to fly and grab the heart piece!
<cachi01> or was it just....A DREAM?
<TheMaster> you can't marry out of royalty unless you're Edward the VIII
<Kandarihu> I honestly don't think we can protect the title of the Season 3 premier anymore.
<Kandarihu> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 18 days, 16 hours, 34 minutes, 4 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have a question, what annoys you more? characters that are related to main characters that come out of nowhere? Or just one shot characters
<cachi01> MadSurge: DAT COD REFERENCE >_>
<Major> Kandarihu well Shining isnt a prince so.....
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: he'll still be a prince probably
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Major: He technically is now
<TheMaster> you have to introduce a character sometime
<Coldays> allright i just booked a plain to Koria i must save the Scootaloo's
<Petrified_Discord> Doesn't this make Twilight a dutchess or something?
<TheMaster> and I don't think he's a prince. He's probably prince-consort.
<MadSurge> cachi01: eeyup <_<
<shizumobile> Oops...
<Petrified_Discord> Trees revenge
<TheMaster> I doubt he gets any claim on cadences' titles...assuming she has any
<MadSurge> DED
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But the problem I have is its twilights BROTHER, NEVER MENTIONED BEFORE
<MadSurge> :D
<AVS619> lol
<TheMaster> clearly twilight is very private.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You dont just not mention a sibling or have a reference or something
<MadSurge> Fluttershy wanted revenge!
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[School], there's no problem with oneshot characters. I vote conjured-up relatives.
<Petrified_Discord> The death has been doubled
<Coldays> indeed
<cachi01> well i think shining armor is now prince cause....uhm.....well THIS http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N1ji-9xoZtM/UCGB8VIjHqI/AAAAAAAAE8o/hRB01t7KCvQ/s1600/69170__.jpg oh god the horror
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It would annoy me less if he was at leastmentioned sometime but no, he comes out of the fucking blue
*Celestia`s_Bunny outs down his backpack and sits down "Sup"
<TheMaster> So that would make Twilight an aunt
<Petrified_Discord> cachi01: What. the. fuck.
<Major> MY EYES
<alexxm> thats horryfing cachi91
<RoboGerbil> cachi01: wow thats horribad
<LunasGuard> princess skyla?
<cachi01> Petrified_Discord: shining armor + cadence = that thing
<TheMaster> i guess if the cakes can have kids then theres no reason cadence and shining armor can't
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Aka marketing!
<TheMaster> though I wonder where you'd rate their ages. Mid 20s?
<Petrified_Discord> cachi01: HEADCANON DENIED
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Even hasbro makes Oc's!
<LunasGuard> how many princesses are their and who does what?
<TheMaster> or maybe cadence is in her early 30s
<Paspie> Back
<Petrified_Discord> cachi01: Also, what the fuck does "Mommy, are you a princess too?" mean?
<Kandarihu> InB4 Princess Skyla becomes canon in the main series but takes on a similar aesthetic to the Cake foals.
<cachi01> xD
<Coldays> i looked at the link and my computer froze i was scared for those 3 seconds of my life
<TheMaster> of course, this all raises the serious question of what Cadence is princess of
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So hasbro maes terrible OC's as well
<Petrified_Discord> NO, like, SERIOUSLY.
<Petrified_Discord> WHAT.
<TheMaster> and where cadence even came from
<twilight_sprinkle> dat crysis
<cachi01> cadence is princess..of shining armors heart DAAAAAAAAAAW
*cachi01 slaps himself
<Major> ^
<TheMaster> shush oda
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Cadence is the princess of shipping
<twilight_sprinkle> but cachi01 , himself isnt here
<Major> XD
<LunasGuard> Coldays: :D
<TheMaster> clearly cadence was introduced to begin the process of transforming my little pony into game of thrones
<Coldays> yea i thought only luna and celestia where alicorn or pegicorn where she come frome
<cachi01> twoiloight_sprunkl pls go :D
<Bronysith> So much cloaking
<MadSurge> TheMaster: :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> We assume Cadence ships everything
<Petrified_Discord> cachi01: It's simple. Celestia watches over the sun and Luna watches over the moon. Cadence is a foalsitter, so she watches over the twiligth. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> ilu2 cashie
<TheMaster> Brace yourselves, ponies are coming
<RoboGerbil> anyone wan to play l4d2?
<cachi01> Petrified_Discord: what u did there i see
<Bronysith> http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/Game-of-thrones-2012-Dragoncon-325136406?q=gallery%3Abronysith%2F36810665&qo=14 TheMaster game of thrones you say?
<TheMaster> though who would be the pony lannisters? Blueblood?
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, that would make for an amazing fanfic.
<Petrified_Discord> Game of Ponies
<cachi01> le fleur?
<ASoftFluffyThing> 4444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444
<Coldays> noo not Blueblood
<TheMaster> I doubt a fanfic version of game of thrones with ponies would go anywhere but on the explicit pony archive
<LunasGuard> ahhh dragoncon...love it
<Bronysith> jesus christ that wall

<LunasGuard> Bronysith: at one time, yes
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sorry about that guys.
<TheMaster> there arn't enough characters and the ponies are too nice to even begin fitting in characters to translate to GOT
<LunasGuard> Bronysith: in 2010
<AJIsAwesome> What's wrong, ASoftFluffyThing?
<Bronysith> LunasGuard: you cosplay?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: You need to watch yourself.
<TheMaster> Though it'd be funny to imagine Celestia as Robert Baratheon
<Colt_Brovakiin> Don't worry ASoftFluffyThing, we still love you!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Got kicked for spam.
<Ryunosuke> all i have to say is i hope ps2 gets a hell of alot more stable before release, a crash an hour is not good for a game ><
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: What did you spam?
<ASoftFluffyThing> My keyboard was acting up and I accidentally pressed the enter button
<LunasGuard> Bronysith: no not really
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: goddamn friggin wrong chat..

<Coldays> HI Ponies47
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya Ponies47 :)
<cachi01> the trees are spies SpadeMagnes[School] they are trying to stop the USA government from manufacturing bacon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's OK ASoftFluffyThing.
<Petrified_Discord> ASoftFluffyThing: It went on 4ever
<AJIsAwesome> 5ever
<LunasGuard> dat pun
<TheMaster> Rarity would be sansa, thats about the only GOT translation that would fit
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Lol
<shizumobile> That was low profile right
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: (\

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: You into cosplay?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: kind of, slowly getting into it
<alexxm> glitchy parachute
<Petrified_Discord> Better than being out of cosplay.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: like for dragoncon next year im going as phoenix wright, Monk from FFtactics, and Eitehr dart or King albert from legend of dragoon
<Coldays> JAAAAAANNNNNKKKINS!!!!!!!

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Objection?
<TheMaster> king albert? not Lavitz?
<shizumobile> Take that lorax!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nittany_Discord: Keyboard's shorting so it randomly spews out 4's. Pressed the enter button accidentally when I moved my lappy :3
<Spell-of-Gaming> OVERUSED
<Spell-of-Gaming> MEEEEEEEEEEEEME
<cachi01> i have only cosplayed as tobi from naruto :/
<Bronysith> TheMaster: i want a cloak
<TheMaster> I speak for the trees for the trees are full of bullets
<twilight_sprinkle> the freeze gun in ths game is so much fun'
<cachi01> i have a keyblade buuuut meh
<Bronysith> TheMaster: also he dies really early on
<Lyra`> im going to acon as a left 4 dead witch some time
<Petrified_Discord> TheMaster: THIS is how the Lorax remake should have been!
<LunasGuard> Bronysith: do u make ur own?
<AJIsAwesome> I have a Hollow Ichigo mask, and that's about it.
*Major doesn't really care for cosplay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thought about cosplaying, but I felt too embarrassed to do it. I've also never been into conventions.
<TheMaster> the only character i'd cosplay as is brad majors from Rocky Horror Picture show
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So how is cutting down tons of trees keeping a low profile?
<Bronysith> LunasGuard: im going to buy a blue suit for phoenix wright
<TheMaster> because I look like him
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: its really fun
<Bronysith> LunasGuard: but i got to figure how to make a wig
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: you should try it
<twilight_sprinkle> cosplaying scosts money
<TheMaster> then again, I could always cosplay as a time lord
<Petrified_Discord> Regarding obscure pony cosplays, I have yet to see a Featherweight cosplay. Any other background ponies come to mind?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: time and money
<cachi01> i could cosplay as myself
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thought about doing it for Halloween, but I could only think of things I can't dress as.
<twilight_sprinkle> thats about as far as id go in cosplaying
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: sloooondermaaaaan
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe get a lab coat walk around, thats the most id bother
<AJIsAwesome> I would REALLY need to save up on money if I wanted to cosplay.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Give slenderman his 20 bucks
<cachi01> GIMME 20 DOLLAHS
*Bronysith murders cachi01
<Bronysith> But seriously
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01One year was Soi Fong from Bleach.

*LunasGuard needs to start playing skyrim again

<DashWithRainbows> Yeah, the freedom to set a bad example for BaconMane >:l
<Shizuka> 13else source engine's windowed borderless mode
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shizuka, I know I just press on the Possible
<DashWithRainbows> Also, howdy Alej.
<Meanwhile> Well, that should set up more variety in the future Shizu.
<Shizuka> 13yes possible
<CrimsonPhoenix> as in is it in good quality?
<ASoftFluffyThing|LoS> Thanks for the stream, Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13well you can ask everyone how racing went
<CrimsonPhoenix> or is it just barely possible
<Shizuka> 13after i got the sizes synced properly seemed to be good
<Chrysalis> Racing went good
<Chrysalis> though got a little agressive on some of the later races
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Racing went well. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/SLMvyX5yqXI HELLOOOOOOOO October #1
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hello.
<oni_link> Thanks for a very entertaining stream once more Shizuka
<Meanwhile> Racing started out with the quality of a birds-eye lego sculpture but that got fixed.
<Stary> Thnks for the stream Shizuka ^_^
<CrimsonPhoenix> mmmh interesting
<Colt_Brovakiin> Thanks Shizuka :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> if Children of the night doesn't come out this month
<CrimsonPhoenix> that video will clearly go #1 in this month's top 10
<Shizuka> 13the real test will be if it manages to play blood harvest without failing like scrcap+fmle does >>
<Stary> CrimsonPhoenix: Yep, I'm still waiting for the finished vid though. It's gonna be good! :)
<Meanwhile> Will that be on L4D1 or 2 Shizu?
<Cades> hey
<Shizuka> 13hm, either i suppose
<CrimsonPhoenix> Stary I gotta admit to you I kinda lost hype now
<Shizuka> 13still prefer 1 though
<Meanwhile> Amen. Versus or Campaign.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sure it's ludicrously beautifull but
<Shizuka> 13was campaign when vivi streamed it
<CrimsonPhoenix> seeing the gifs, the behind scenes and now the trailer
<CrimsonPhoenix> I kinda saw what I needed
<Meanwhile> Well, either way, I can lend a shotgun if you need one at the time.
<Stary> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah, too long to be honest. It's been months since they released the preview.
<CrimsonPhoenix> the animatic you mean
<LunasGuard|COD> whos planning on getting black ops 2 on xbox
<CrimsonPhoenix> IRONSIGHT
<Stary> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm getting in on PC.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So it'll be the crappy version.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh boy Nittany_Discord why
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Got it as a gift.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SPEAKING OF GIFT\
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/58261/Gift
<CrimsonPhoenix> Great fresh new fanfic right there
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Actually, I hope the PC version will be good.
<Stary> You wrote it?
<CrimsonPhoenix> prepare your tissu though
<CrimsonPhoenix> Implying I'm the MLP fanfic writer god
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok that was a bit of a stretch
<Chrysalis> PC version > xbox
<Chrysalis> better graphics better players
<Stormy`> hi
<Bronysith> if i ever write fanfiction again, im staying away from OCs and just focus on main characters
<Chrysalis> and no auto-aim
<Chrysalis> and free multiplayer
<CrimsonPhoenix> but still shortskirtsandexplosions is amazing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MP is free on any system except Xbox.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, OCs are alright as long as they aren't overwhelming
<CrimsonPhoenix> and fit in the background area
<Chrysalis> also, the cod's have supported controllers on the pc as well
<Chrysalis> so there is actually no reason the console is better
<Stary> Bronysith: I include a few minor OC's of my own in my fanfic from time to time. It helps the flow of the story well :)
<cachi01> wow nethack sure is short
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: except original consoles, like the NES SNES or PS1
<Chrysalis> Bronysith thats not this argument
<Chrysalis> this argument is about black ops 2
<cachi01> black ops 2 looks good
<cachi01> it might be a good cod game
<Chrysalis> nah
<RainbowPie> hey!
<cachi01> 8 player zombies with campaign
<soulrider95> It has dedi servers on PC and FoV slider so I'll probably get it
<Chrysalis> they stopped being good after modernwarfare

<AJIsAwesome|MK7> CrimsonPhoenix: :D
<Spitfire> :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I do like the Memory link changes the game dialouge somewhat
<cachi01> beep boop
<BarbThePopUp> son
<Dken2021> yea, it really gives pokemon a deep story, which surprises me
<CrimsonPhoenix> MON VISAGE QUAND http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2175563/fullcredits#cast
<CrimsonPhoenix> When you see it guys
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> ALready did. :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Erm..
<Dken2021> Oh my god... Nolan North?
<cachi01> JOHN DE FUCKING LANCIE
<cachi01> JOHN DE LANCIE
<cachi01> JOHN DE LANICE
<cachi01> WUT
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How many games has he been in now?
<cachi01> FAK
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> I'm not really a fan of Assasin's Creed, so I'm not sure if I'm going to get this game.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Assassin's Creed is pretty cool
<CrimsonPhoenix> climbing buldans
<VenHur> John De Lancie?
<CrimsonPhoenix> throat slingan
<cachi01> assassins creed is awesome
<oni_link> holy shit dude
<Dken2021> assassin doods...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I stand by my point that Snes rainbow road is the worst track
<VenHur> Assassin's Creed...meh.
<DocSane> Yay! Landed a new project! I shan't go without money next month!
<otakon> actually
<cachi01> VenHur: yep he plays william miles
<alexxm> how come SpadeMagnes[School]
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> I don't mind SNES Rainbow Road.
<otakon> I want to try out AC3
<otakon> it looks good
<VenHur> William Miles?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well in 7 you cant boost at all or you pretty much fly off
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<VenHur> Dafuq is that?
<alexxm> bye GilDash
<oni_link> night GilDash
<Dken2021> nighty GilDash
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Night, GilDash. :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> alexxm: And you know if you trail someone for awhile you can boost by?
<VenHur> Night GilDash.
<thelonepony> Night GilDash :)
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> You mean drafting?
<cachi01> night GilDash :)
<DeadpoolDash> I have played assassin's creed, but have never bought any of those games
<SpadeMagnes[School]> AJIsAwesome|MK7: Yea that
<cachi01> john de lancie is desmond's dad
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You are pretty much fucked if you draft behind someone in that track
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You fly right off
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> I actually like the immense difficulty of that track,
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> *.
<Ryunosuke> the problem i have with assassins creed, is the ninja turtle complex basically :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> and curiously enough he's been in revelation as well
<Dken2021> Ryunosuke ninja turtles?
<oni_link> Ryunosuke: how so?
<cachi01> i've never played revelation. but my brother did
<otakon> NINJA TURTLES!
<Lyra`> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4551101_460s_v1.jpg
<cachi01> >11 years old
<cachi01> >finishes all AC 100% in a week
<Dken2021> Lyra` oh dear...
<cachi01> im like wut
<Lyra`> anyone else think anime sandy is adorbz?
<otakon> Lyra`: um wut
<SpadeMagnes[School]> For some reason I never play as anyone besides Metal Mario
<otakon> Lyra`: yes but the rest is creepy as hell
<VenHur> Lyra`: ...What?
<Lyra`> thats what pops up when you google handsome squidward
<thelonepony> Lyra`: que?
<oni_link> Lyra`: me and the rest is weird :(
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> SpadeMagnes[School]: I always play as either Mario or Metal Mario.
<cachi01> that and r34
<Ryunosuke> back in the 80's ninja were cool because they.... flipped out and decapitated everyone on sight, which is NOT what ninja do, same as assassins creed assassins, yes they killed people, but they werent... flashy, that goes against EVERYTHING of being covert ;)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My main cart is the koopa car
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> I think mainly because of his massive speed stat.
<Domo> Handsome Squidward you Myotismon looking little so and so (digimon reference for the win)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> combined with the slick tires it drifts like a beaut
<oni_link> Ryunosuke: oh
<Dken2021> Ryunosuke I'm guessing the trend is assaassins now
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You can transfer data from one 3ds to another right?
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d5ipeb3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ryunosuke, no I get what he means
<CrimsonPhoenix> think of Twilight vampires
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Does that include your data like your friend code?
<Ryunosuke> if one was to be an assassin, one does NOT dress up in WHITE ARMOR with a CLOAK. One dresses up as a stableboy, or a pauper, or someone that NO ONE NOTICES :)
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> SpadeMagnes[School]: No don't think so.
<CrimsonPhoenix> while vampires are cool and all
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Damn
<CrimsonPhoenix> THEY DO NOT SPARKLE UNDER THE SUN
<CrimsonPhoenix> unlike some lavender pony we all know and love
<alexxm> but they do count
<VenHur> And to this day, ninjas are STILL cool.
<Dken2021> AJIsAwesome|MK7 and then all those fan theories about their parents would be ruined when there's a season 3 episode showing their parents, it would be glorious
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well so much for my idea of keeping all my data when I transfer it to my 3ds XL
<VenHur> Unlike vampires...
<VenHur> *scoffs*
<pony_2438> brony for the win
<Ryunosuke> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leobr7Z7mO1qchw13o1_500.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> lawl Ryunosuke
<Dken2021> god I love this music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKWwtNRBcKs
<Ryunosuke> i felt it was relavent
<oni_link> Ryunosuke: you actually don a lutist disguise in Assassin's Creed Revelations
<pony_2438> loll
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wonder when they're gonna make the next pokemon stadium/collisium
<RainbowPie> I have to go everyone, gonna go practice my art skills so i can finally try and draw a mlp character :D cya!
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[School], never
<cachi01> well, i've been living a lie.........i dont know what to beleave know http://regator.com/p/257638252/blowing_on_cartridges_didnt_help_them_it_hurt/
<Ryunosuke> ehh lutist is .... iffy
<CrimsonPhoenix> also
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well they did one for gen 4 so why not gen 5?
<CrimsonPhoenix> you guys played Stadium only for the mini-games
<cachi01> now
<cachi01> *
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> CrimsonPhoenix: I didn't. :S
<Ryunosuke> people tend to notice a lutist, especially a really good one or a really bad one
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: yep :3
<VenHur> We need a Pokemon game similar to Battle Revolution with the trainer customising.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|MK7, LIES
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> In fact, I played it for the cups. :S
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Except alot less shitty
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] if they were listening with their wallets, nintendo would allow one for the Wii U
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> That and the gym leaders.
<CrimsonPhoenix> EVERYONE PLAYS STADIUM FOR THE MINIGAMES
<CrimsonPhoenix> EVERY
<cachi01> http://regator.com/p/257638252/blowing_on_cartridges_didnt_help_them_it_hurt/ look we've been living a lie!!!!!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> ONE
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I always nickname my pokemon
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The whole ALL CAPS pisses me off
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> I only nickname certain pokemon.
<oni_link> Ryunosuke: he plays music while other assassins stealthily eliminate targets
<cachi01> my first pokemon in crystal is called sex slave
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Heres what I dont get
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> .....
<cachi01> my name is bigdick
<Ryunosuke> oni_link, same rule applies :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Crystal had animated sprites right?
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Yep
<VenHur> cachi01: ....Let me guess...the pokemon was female?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why did they drop it for R/S and brought it back for Emerald?
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> *shrugs*
<alexxm> SpadeMagnes[School] i think all of the 3rd games had moving sprites
<cachi01> VenHur: i really dont know........it was a chikorita (he/she already evolved)
<Panda-> -__- fuckin internet
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No firered/leafgreen and ruby/sappire were still sprites
<Dken2021> you know what feature I'd like they bring back? thew secret bases
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also you know whats great about Black/white 2?
<VenHur> Oh yeah...gender didn't appeared until Gen III...my bad cachi01.
<oni_link> Dken2021: I love that song, very smooth and relaxing :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If you accidentaly K.O a legendary you can re fight it
<cachi01> what if they are already in the game but they are so secret that we havent found them Dken2021 :o
<oni_link> ^
<alexxm> test
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> alexxm: A+
<Dken2021> conspiracykeeanu.jpr :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[School], ummm isn't that defeating the purpose?
*sonicandmario85 sneaks into the chat and ats ALL the muffins
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> CrimsonPhoenix: Accidently kill, perhaps?
<sonicandmario85> eats*
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|MK7, no such thing as accidently kill
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im still confused why Heatran has genders
<CrimsonPhoenix> You have to judge carefully your move
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Poison, burn, confusion kill?
<cachi01> btw theres this really weird giant pokemon im trying to catch but idk why but i cant fight him. and he also talks
<cachi01> iirc its name was oak
<CrimsonPhoenix> lawl oak
<oni_link> haha

<Bronysith> what if i put nutella on pancakes
<alexxm> Bronysith then you have something delicous
<oni_link> companion cube badge is best badge
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Alsoapperently you can get a item in B2/W2 that increases shiny encounter rates

<sonicandmario85> ember is best attack
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> SpadeMagnes[School]: And out of all that, you only get a diploma.
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> BEST REWARD EVER.
<Kandarihu> That image depicts Oak having 152 Pokemon. Does that mean he even has a Missingno?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> AJIsAwesome|MK7: Actually you get something better in B2/W2
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<SpadeMagnes[School]> AJIsAwesome|MK7: You get a item to increase shiny encounter rates
<Dark92Enigma> My mom enjoys trolling me
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> SpadeMagnes[School]: Only when you catch all of them?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Look at your trainer, now look at me, now at your trainer, now at me
<Dark92Enigma> as much as Scoot-Scootaloo enjoys trolling you guys
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My guide says you have to fill the national dex first
<CrimsonPhoenix> sadly he isn't me http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2qs7vpCSD1rt4yceo1_500.jpg
<Dken2021> well at least that's something other than an electronic paper
<VenHur> Missingno is such a rare Pokemon...oh, and it's #000 to me
<Scoot-Scootaloo> >_>
<oni_link> ^

<VenHur> ...I ate a canary...I thought it was taco.
<VenHur> Don't sue me!
<LadyCanary> ;3;
<otakon> I recognize that one guy
<otakon> Seriously at least it's not Power Girl
<Everlasting_Joy> I love this episode because of how angry Linkara gets. It isn't for jokes, it's pure abhorance.
<otakon> seriously even I find her too much
<CriticKitten> Cry for Justice is such adorable trash.
<LadyCanary> Yes indeed.
<LadyCanary> HEY otakon. :| Power Girl is cool.
<CriticKitten> Explosions can counter other explosions.
<CriticKitten> That's just science.
<Kurra> i bbs
<otakon> LadyCanary: no no, don't get me wrong I like the character, but the DESIGN of her costume and her fluctuating bust is what bugs me..
<DerpyMuffins> Lightning hurts
<DerpyMuffins> Who knew?
<LadyCanary> otakon: So what?
<Coldays> Ever
<twilight_sprinkle> female heroes should start being nerdy girls with glasses instead of fanservice teen-like girls with huge boobs
<Saturn> 08,01http://i.imgur.com/O3WWi.png
<LadyCanary> But u liek teh boobies.
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: artist liberties

<Everlasting_Joy> twilight_sprinkle: That.
<LadyCanary> twilight_sprinkle: Stop.
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: dat entropy
<LadyCanary> No.
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: yh I can take taht but good LORD they gave her a goddamn chestless costume and huge boobs... it's ridiculous at times
<twilight_sprinkle> LadyCanary: maybe i do :3 but thats not what female heroes should be like, they shouldnt be about good looks
<Coldays> I like teh Boobies
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: I have to agree, the whole "fanservice" girl trend needs to die.
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: <3

*Kurra doesn't pull aggro
<otakon> good lord
<CriticKitten> This is the best plan.
<LadyCanary> twilight_sprinkle: Not ALL of the shots of the female heroes are fanservice based. Only recently, with heroes like Starfire, have become too oversexualized. >_< As revealing as her outfit is, she could still kick ass.
<otakon> this is the most conoluted plot I've ever heard
<CriticKitten> otakon: Clearly you haven't heard of Ultimatum.
<otakon> LadyCanary: actually I like Wonder Woman, she kicks ass

<Lyra`> you smell nice
<Mega_Milk> otakon: There are several dresses I have seen before that have that.
<Lyra`> and i really like your mane
<LadyCanary> twilight_sprinkle: Their outfits can change. Black Canary's has changed throughout. Not ALL of the poses are fanservicey. Starfire is just a victim of it way too much. She's a great character, but used in too many compromising positions
<otakon> Mega_Milk: hmmm okay

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, HoodyNinja. :)
<CriticKitten> Shizu: You had to see the previous bits to get this
<Shizuka> 13i think we have reached a paradox....
<thelonepony> Hi HoodyNinja :)
<Shizuka> 13twilight was a better love story than this
<SaxyPretender> 0,14lies
<Stormy`> Haha, really?
<VenHur> My mind is full of fuckety fuck fucks, Shizuki.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14lies and slander

<otakon> and I like it
<oni_link> okay, night Ponies47|ZZZ
<otakon> night Ponies47|ZZZ
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: Watch the Pokemon episode to see the conclusion, it's actually really good.
<Stormy`> People always think I'm a guy on the internet :P
<Mega_Milk> It kinda looks like a dressed up bike helmet.....
<DerpyMuffins> Cya Ponies47|ZZZ
<Shizuka> 13i don't even know who this is
<Coldays> Night Ponies47
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah...I usually skip the weird storyline stuff and just stick with watching the review parts
<ASoftFluffyThing> EVERYTHING is a better love story than Twilight. Except the 50 shades of the combination of black and white
<otakon> I think it is but I like it dammit
<BarbThePopUp> shit
<Buytoast> what
<BarbThePopUp> Oh sit.
<Coldays> Yes

<pony_102311> Hello.
<ASoftFluffyThing> My lord
<Coldays> well sounded like it for a minit
<Stormy`> I thought it sounded a bit more feminine than masculine, but I guess it is kind of androgenous
<otakon> abrony: the capture is off
<ASoftFluffyThing> This is like....
<flutterchu> so......boring
<thelonepony> Hi pony_102311 :)

<oni_link> It still looks great
<likeaboss> oh shit
<Cynder7> 6Nice :3
<twilight_sprinkle> especially the untouchable metal wagon things
<twilight_sprinkle> this game is the most fun when youve set punch strength to 1000x
<DeadpoolDash> nade spam
<Dken2021> game does look pretty
<twilight_sprinkle> you can punch a tank into a building and destroy the building and everyone inside
<Kimori> It doesnt snow where I live
<twilight_sprinkle> and by building i mean one of those wimpy houses
<Dken2021> yay abusing physics!
<Cades> I remember last year or the year before, it never snowed until christmas haha
<DeadpoolDash> my cloak always ran out way faster then that
<twilight_sprinkle> DeadpoolDash: same
<likeaboss> holy shit
<twilight_sprinkle> i sense hacks tbh
<HoodyNinja> Shizuhax
<twilight_sprinkle> her cloak doesnt even waste any energy when not moving, iirc its supposed to
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: so is that a bad or good thing to be able to do that?
<oni_link> the building destruction
<likeaboss> how many nades dose he have!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: its good because it makes the game more fun, but whats bad is that the game gets boring pretty fast without messing with the console
<DeadpoolDash> yeah this is god mode, ammo and nades never run out
<Cades> it snows a lot earlier than christmas
<Cades> usually
<twilight_sprinkle> unlimited nades too
<twilight_sprinkle> yep hacks
<Dken2021> yay game desing abousement!

<Polydunami> Right, I should've known
<Ordinalthrone> that was strangely mesmerising to watch...
<HoodyNinja|Sleepy> Some kid started calling me Polly at school...
<Shizuka> 13i hit a grey early on and missed lots of blocks while showing off
<AJIsAwesome> ^

<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja|Sleepy: they hacked into the game and changed their scores because they knew that SHizu's was much higher than theirs. :3
<twilight_sprinkle> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: currently its sweet victory from spongebob
<oni_link> awwwwwwww yeaaaaaaaaaaaaa

<Polydunami> Or something to that effect
<Ordinalthrone> i love it

*NocturnalBlade dances with ASoftFluffyThing|Zzz
<NocturnalBlade> Polydunami: what is it?
<AJIsAwesome> In the DS version of the new Micheal Jackson game, the pirated version would have vuvuzuellas playing over the audio so that you couldn't play it as well.
<HoodyNinja|Sleepy> Okay, I have to sleep nao, I can't stay here with you guys forever, nighty night
<Shizuka> 13i love that ending so much

<ASoftFluffyThing|Zzz> AJIsAwesome I'm not goin to bed lol

<AJIsAwesome> Please, no sleepy music. l~l
<oni_link> I like your music library Shizuka ;~;
<NocturnalBlade> Polydunami: aah
<HoodyNinja|Sleepy> Peace
<AJIsAwesome> I don't want to sleep yet. ;3;
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: do you have evangelion ost?

<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: i think its fine for me
<Polydunami> Aww, I don't want to refresh during this song :(

<Panda> twilight_sprinkle because I smell like peaches :3
<Panda> and hello DyernalSword
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: ..i liek eating peaches >:3
<AJIsAwesome> I like cereal. :3
<twilight_sprinkle> i liek cheese
<twilight_sprinkle> i really do
<twilight_sprinkle> is favorite food
<oni_link> lol me too AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> I AM THE CHEESE~
<twilight_sprinkle> I AM THE WALRUS
<oni_link> you will be eaten
<Polydunami> So do you have any particular favourite brand of cheese, twilight_sprinkle?
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: idk, perhaps brie or camambert
<AJIsAwesome> I'm always wanted to try limburger cheese.
<twilight_sprinkle> last brie i ate was glorious~
<Polydunami> I'm not sure if I've ever tried camambert, but I've really enjoyed the odd brie.
<AJIsAwesome> I've yet to try brie. Seems interesting.
<twilight_sprinkle> camambert is pretty good too, but the last one i bought wasnt imported so it asnt as good
<AJIsAwesome> Imported cheese is best cheese.
<twilight_sprinkle> but im a student so i dont want to buy any expensive stuff, imported costs a lot
<twilight_sprinkle> bad idea for the game to have that tune, it messes with the song
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony :3
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Spell-of-Gaming
<Polydunami> Hey there, Spell-of-Gaming

<Vivix> Same here twilight_sprinkle, yet somehow, she's one of my favs
<DeathStar> Gentelmen-geeky: in some cases you are right. but pinkie dose haver mer moments of insain adorableness
<twilight_sprinkle> its probably because pinkie has more to her than loud randomness
<Gentelmen-geeky> DeathStar: pinky one of my fave becou i act like her in puplic
<oni_link> Shes my favorite for precisely those random moments and her comedic relief
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i have played the spike toss

<oni_link> heated wire looks like a laser
<DeathStar> Gentelmen-geeky: actualy it's not all the time ^_^
<Moopy> But remember guys do not touch the laser or you will be dead
<Kencolt> This has to be Sumica streaming. Not because of the little pony onscreen, but because who else would show a program on how to make a bike helmet?
<Gentelmen-geeky> DeathStar: you siad "i act like here randumly" it wold not be randume if you aced like here all the time
<oni_link> lol this is interesting though

<Kencolt> Sumica: Well, I don't know about How it's Made, but they had such on Unwrapped.
<DeathStar> Gentelmen-geeky: ^_^ it's fine
<Gentelmen-geeky> DeathStar: yay
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moopy: Dat awesome O3O
<Kencolt> Unwrapped is a show on the Cooking Channel (used to be on Food Network) about how various commercial food products ar made. They did a how on Microwave Burritos.
<Moopy> eeyup
<Gentelmen-geeky> im a moo
<Kencolt> Well, not a whole show, but at least a segment.
<Sumica> 00,10eh it's not food network any more?
<Gentelmen-geeky> DeathStar: what are you going as for halloween
<Moopy> Heh sorry sumica
<DeathStar> Gentelmen-geeky: nothing mutch

<Sumica> 00,10hmmm, my cable still calls it food network
<DeathStar> Sumica: do you not eat aluminum?
<oni_link> Sumica: i think Kencolt meant that it no longer airs on the Food Network but is shown on the Cooking Channel
<Kencolt> Sumica: There are TWO channels. Food Network and the Cooking Channel. Both part of the same firm.
<DeathStar> aluminium*
<Sumica> 00,10ohhhh
<oni_link> I wouldnt mind working in a refinery
<JRP> why am i think of this as r34
<Sumica> 00,10and this is why recycleing is better
<Gentelmen-geeky> thats a big tea pot
<JRP> must be just me
<Gentelmen-geeky> JRP: -_(\
<oni_link> lol
<Sumica> 00,10cause making new aluminum is expensive as hell
<Gentelmen-geeky> Sumica: hell is expensive
<twilight_sprinkle> angus?
<twilight_sprinkle> like the burger king angus?
<Kencolt> Sumica: And yet, recycling is never 100%, and the need/demand for aluminum always increases, so making new aluminum is needed.
<Sumica> 00,10ingets
<oni_link> Sumica: which is why Apple is hated so much. Lets shave down a whole block the size of two human head to make one Unibody laptop -.(\
<DeathStar> Gentelmen-geeky: no no hell has free entry
<Kencolt> Ingots.
<oni_link> *heads
<taoumi> ingets

<Phase4> they can rapid prototype entire cars these days
<Gentelmen-geeky> niht DeathStar im go to bed
<Phase4> straight from software to assembled car
<oni_link> wow
<DeathStar> Gentelmen-geeky: night night
<Kencolt> This is truth... http://derpiboo.ru/130436

<oni_link> lmao Kencolt
<Sumica> 00,10ever seen a carbion fiber mill?
<Phase4> Sumica, dont think i have
<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate! :$
<Phase4> that is a tiny battery
<oni_link> morning MadSurge
<Sumica> 00,10they can knit aircrafthulls in like 8 hours
<Phase4> Sumica, that... wow, that is huge
<Sumica> 00,10mind you not huge aircraft
<oni_link> how about that, the battery was conceived in the 1800s
<MadSurge> oni_link: by an italian XD
<Sumica> 00,10we are talking like leerjet size
<oni_link> lol yup
<Sumica> 00,10bunny people
<Phase4> Sumica, thats still a lot to assemble
<Ordinalthrone> batterry companies will never go under
<Ordinalthrone> so many people need them
<XylemTube> How it's made! \o/
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah they use a blowup mold and they knit the carbon fiber over it with somthing akin to an inkjet brinter head
<oni_link> indeed Ordinalthrone
<Sumica> 00,10printer*
<DeathStar> Ordinalthrone: unless we find different ways to power things... makeing batteries redundent
<Ordinalthrone> but battery companies will probably be the ones to develop it
<Vivix> Even if we find other ways to make electricity, we will probably not change batteries too much
<Vivix> Only one I know is--hydrobatteries? I dunno
<DeathStar> Ordinalthrone: not nessesarily.
<KnifeH> I made myself sad. Where's a wall when you need one...
<Phase4> fun fact: cell voltage is determined by the battery chemestry, for example lead cells are 1.2v
<Phase4> does not matter how large you make it, 1.2v
<DeathStar> KnifeH: between the floor and the cealing
<Vivix> Somehow, that is cool
<oni_link> wow Im learning and I like it :3
<Ordinalthrone> DeathStar, how many other companies research mass production of portable power?
<Sumica> 00,10NiCad batters are nice for rechargables but suck in your tv remote
<DeathStar> Ordinalthrone: I dunno...
<Ordinalthrone> Phase4, that is indeed fun
<Phase4> i think nicads have leakage problems
<Vivix> NiCads? GOOGLE
<Sumica> 00,10yeah they do
<Phase4> nmhi are better for remotes
<DeathStar> Ordinalthrone: but it dosn't have to come from a company...
<KnifeH> DeathStar , I lack those fancy things.
<Ordinalthrone> DeathStar, me neither... I'm genuinely interested...
<Vivix> Ah yeah, we don't have them in our remotes- most of our uses eh those shallow clock batteries
<Vivix> at least the new ones
<oni_link> I am so watching this series :3
<Ordinalthrone> DeathStar, who will produce it then?
<DeathStar> Ordinalthrone: same actually.. but it's too late in the day for me to start reserching....
<[547URN]> 08,01so i just had porridge
<Sumica> 00,10they discharge on there own Phase4 but they dont develop battery memory and can go up to 2500mil amps in double A's
<[547URN]> 08,01with cheese
<[547URN]> 08,01it was amazing
<Ordinalthrone> DeathStar, Amen
<Vivix> Porridge with cheese?
<[547URN]> 08,01indeed
<Vivix> I've had porridge with meat--but hm
<Vivix> I love cheese, I'll try that some day
<pony_947181> Guys, I'm trying to find an episode based on a really vague description, can someone help me?
<DeathStar> Ordinalthrone: it only takes one person to discover somthing... a scientist working on somthing compleatly different could work it out
<Ordinalthrone> I have porridge with honey :3
<Pinkies4thWall|Xbox> Dude, Saturn . I fucking love cheese
<Phase4> Sumica, 2.5A is better than single use
<Vivix> Milk and rice porridge, right?
<Ordinalthrone> DeathStar, scientists need funding
<Sumica> 00,10hehe nope
<oni_link> Havent had porridge at all
<DeathStar> Ordinalthrone: that's true ^_^
<Kencolt> There are so many definitions of "porridge". Every culture has had some version of it.
<Sumica> 00,10mind you this was my old old old mp3 player
<pony_947181> There's an Ice or crystal statue that breaks; someone depressed drinking lot of tea or something in a bar; and a pony that runs a lot, all the time(I assume it was rainbowdash, but I don't know)
<Sumica> 00,10it needed 2100 just to spin up the drive
<Phase4> XD you had an mp3 with one of those micro drives?
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Sumica> 00,10people thought it was a CD player
<Ordinalthrone> DeathStar, One scientist with no funding who get stuff done: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla
<Vivix> My uncle came home with one of those once, "This can fit 1000 songs!!" and we were like "oh my god!"
<Phase4> i'd love to pull one of those apart, miniture hard drives facinate me
<Sumica> 00,10I still have it
<DeathStar> Ordinalthrone: true XD but funding dose help
<Sumica> 00,10also have a more recent one made by coby
<Sumica> 00,10it's a miny video player
<Sumica> 00,10it sucked

<Ordinalthrone> also. Thomas Edison was a dick
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah it was a 10 gig player
<DeathStar> Ordinalthrone: well of corse it's theOatmeal
<Saturn> 08,01it feels like my abdomen has been set alight
<Sumica> 00,10also got a bunch of cash in a lawsuit from creative.
*Saturn 08,01will stop being disgusting now
<oni_link> Saturn dont you have anything you can take to alleviate that?
<Sumica> 00,10seems they were misslabeling mp3 players
<Ordinalthrone> DeathStar, Once again: Amen
<Sumica> 00,10said they held more then they realy did
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: i don't think so; unless i give myself an oil enema
<Ordinalthrone> Saturn, Chilli, Curry, It all hurts
<oni_link> Saturn: well hang in there it'll clear out soon :P
<Saturn> 08,01capaiscin isn't water soluble
<Ordinalthrone> Saturn, Eat Bread. Trust me on this
<Saturn> 08,01but is oil soluble
<Saturn> 08,01Ordinalthrone: that will do nothing
<Saturn> 08,01the problem is not in my stomach

<Sumica> 00,10they been using it to make ultralight body armor
<DeathStar> I like goats but their sideways puples always creep me out a little
<Jmo> Oi, spiders are cool.
<Vivix> Nuh!

<Vivix> DeathStar, horses have the saame eyes, I was so freaked out when I first looked a horse in the eye
<Vivix> now I think its cute-
<Ordinalthrone> Sumica, Body armor is small scale... I'm talking moe efficient aircraft
<Phase4> EXPLODE
<Saturn> 08,01if you've ever tried to cut open a moth cocoon, you'll develop an appreciation for the tensile strength of silk
<Sumica> 00,10well yeah
<DeathStar> Vivix: yeah you do get used to it but....
<Sumica> 00,10but the thing is the stuff is not ridged
<Vivix> I have to admit, it does look creepy, but--yeah you get used to it or fond of it
<DeathStar> need moth facts? better hook up with Saturn
<Kencolt> Fluttershy, sadly, suffers from Fainting Goat syndrome (look up Fainting Goats. It's WIERD.) When you see her kind of topple over and hear a bleating noise (in a couple of eps) that's what those goats do.
<Ordinalthrone> Sumica, Treatment to harden it
<oni_link> lol
<Vivix> Fainting Goaats- so cute, so sad
<oni_link> this is true Kencolt XD
<Sumica> 00,10so many spuds
<Ordinalthrone> Vivix, how is it sad?
<Vivix> They lock up and fall over, so if they're fleeing, they basically leave one behind to slow the chaser
<Kencolt> Ordinalthrone: Well, it's certainly not a survival adaptation.
<Vivix> Old ones can be funny though, the ones who are used to it
<Vivix> just leaning on stuff and--looking all maximum chill
<DeathStar> potato chips are sooo bad for your teeth because of the starch sticking to your teeth >< it's worse than sugar
<Ordinalthrone> Kencolt, True... But the adults learn to keep their feet, and it must serve some purpose. How else would they survive?
<Kencolt> IF they are startled in any way, they just-- as said- lock up and fall over. There's a frigging Fainting Goat Society of people who RAISE these critters.
<taoumi> now i want soem chips
<DeathStar> anyways good night everypony it's bed times for me ^_^
<AdamTheDuck> O.O
<Vivix> It is a gene fail, so it's like--a strange evolution
<AdamTheDuck> All those chips...
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: make a framework which only uses tensile strength to keep it up, then build the building around that
<oni_link> i want chips now -.-
<Phase4> ^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<Vivix> A lot of things in animals, and humans, serve no purpose for survival-

<Sumica> 00,10any time of the day you can order out for any thing
<Vivix> Damn you Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10even sex
<Vivix> So jelly-
<Ordinalthrone> Vivix, Upon some research, the only reason they survived is because they were raised for sllaughter so they are easily killed... That is sad...
<oni_link> im jelly as well
<Vivix> It is-
<Vivix> I'm too nervous to live in Vegas
<Vivix> I'm too nevous to live in TRONDHEIM, Vegas would be suicide
<Sumica> 00,10eh why is that Vivix?
<Vivix> Sociophobic, but getting better
<oni_link> it could only do algebra. already had me beat >.>
<Vivix> It's probably a safe place, I mean- families live there, but it's so--big
<Sumica> 00,10you know if you stay off the strip vegas is like any other city
<Saturn> 08,01right, i'm bored
<Vivix> Yeah, but cities in general- you know

<Vivix> I couldn't live there
<Saturn> 08,01who would be willing to put me up for a week in january?
<Sumica> 00,10you can sleep on my couch, no hobo
