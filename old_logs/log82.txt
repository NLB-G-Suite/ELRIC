<Paul_McColtney> Woooaaaahhhh.....
<Paul_McColtney> Wait until derpy finds out.
<Beatline> Muffins are made from different stuff.
<MrPoniator> That's the first time I actually hear some sort of definition between cupcakes and muffins
<Beatline> Cupcakes are made from cake.
<BlacklightShining> …lolwut?

*Paul_McColtney Beatline will never go to space.
<Polarfire> I always liked catdog.
<Beatline> Colgate, remember: the fact core is always incorrect except what he said about Paul!
<Polarfire> One my my favorites :)
<Paintsplash> NOBODY'S GOING TO SPACE MATE!
<Colgate> (didn't play portal 2)
<abirkin2> Technically 89% of magic tricks are not magic, they are sorcery
<Beatline> The adjectives were correct
<Paul_McColtney> about him being handome
<Locke> I got everyone a free vacation to space!
<Beatline> But the nouns were not
<Beatline> No Paul, you said that
<Paul_McColtney> Colgate needs to play Portal 2
<Paintsplash> also, an ostriches eye is bigger than it's brain.
*Colgate thinks portal 2 is too expensive atm
*Beatline goes to space because it's a terrible meme
*Paul_McColtney doesn't get it.
<Beatline> I got it during the summer sale for $30...
<BlacklightShining> I preordered it for $45
*mook is wondering why he always reading "portal 2" as "postal 2"...
<BlacklightShining> and got a free copy of Portal 1
*Colgate thinks 30$ is still too expensive for what it is
*Paul_McColtney thinks Colgate is wrong on so many levels.
<BlacklightShining> mook: that's not too bad. I once was discussing it and a couple of girls thought it was Porno 2
<Paintsplash> there is a chance that Colgate may have a very minor case...of brain damage.
<Colgate> well, I *do* have a relationship with Berry Punch
<Paul_McColtney> Fact: Portal 2 is amazing and should be played by everyone.
<Beatline> Shortish, yes. Full of epic win, clever dialogue, and brilliant level design? Also yes.
<MrPoniator> I didn't play a whole lot of P2
<Beatline> Well, except Wheatley's first homemade chamber.
<Locke> Celestia: I booked everyone a free vacation to the moon!
<Paul_McColtney> Free DLC: yes

<BlacklightShining> np, that's (one reason) why I'm here
<MrPoniator> Holding two controllers and all
<Beatline> You see that? Right there? I was quoting God.

<Lunasta> How do you make a cloud rock solid?
<MrPoniator> But seriously
<MrPoniator> I'll got take a nap
*BlacklightShining refuses to say ‘ 'night AtomicBrony’ again
<Lunasta> Are you trying to freeze it?
<MrPoniator> Catch ya bronies later
<Beatline> It tends to do that
<BlacklightShining> Lunasta: with PEGASUS MAGIC!
<Paintsplash> ah cold medicine...thats always fun
<Beatline> Lunasta: freeze it.

<Flamerunner> Colgate is illegal in Switzerland?
<Spitfire> I don't know
<Lunasta> And apparently Celestia's Royal Guard is more After Dark than the NLR
<Spitfire> Wait... is Colgate available in other countries?
<Octavia> stats are fun ^.^

<Flamerunner> someone already made a TF2 version of Bad Romance
<Colgate> and a simpl whois there would give you my rl address

<Flamerunner> why not a pony version?

<Beatline> Nopony really seemed to get the references
<Octavia> what did you see?
*Sketch waves back to Octavia
<Sketch> Planet of the apes (rise of)
<Colgate> refernce? I no see references
<Octavia> Beatline, first thing i tought of!
<Octavia> Sketch, ehh, i was debating it.
<Chromadancer> Spitfire -- if you need nicks connected on the statspage send me a memo through memoserv
<Beatline> Well, I'd be sad if it weren't the only thing ^_^
<Spitfire> Why can't I just tell you now?
<Sketch> it was better than I was expecting. And as the last planet movie was.. terrible, I was surprised
<Chromadancer> won't be able to do it till tomorrow tho
<Chromadancer> because ^
<Octavia> icehole also reminds me of fishing
<Colgate> oh, I should totally message you Chromadancer
<Chromadancer> either that or PM me
<Colgate> cause I are a cool pony
<Chromadancer> so i'll have a record
<Beatline> Well, bastages etc. is pretty exclusive
<Chromadancer> maybe I'll set up a command on Owloysius to do it
<Chromadancer> but for now just Memoserv or PM me
<BlacklightShining> you should
<Sketch> Icehole is a shnapps as well
<Beatline> Chroma: Erm, I have about six different nicks to merge, mind if I trouble you with a list? xP
<BlacklightShining> or you should have him look up the nicks with NickServ
*Flamerunner grabs a M4
<Chromadancer> beat -- PM them all to me and i'll add em tomorrow.
<stripes> bye GGgala_
*Flamerunner walks to a battlefield

<killerrabbit> yeah!

<Lunasta> all in 50 line increments
<Lunasta> Except for BigMacintosh
<Lunasta> a 200 line jump there
<Lunasta> DX
<Spitfire> BlacklightShining does it really matter
<Spitfire> They're just stats
<BlacklightShining> yes
<BlacklightShining> it matters
<BlacklightShining> stats are serious
<BlacklightShining> srs bsns
<Lunasta> It's the difference of 5 lines!
<Colgate> stats are the purpose of my life!
<Lunasta> spots*
<Lunasta> I just want my own box dammit
*Colgate is highly considering using this nick for the rest of his life
*Colgate is also drunk, so this may not be true
<GraphiteLuck> Stats: srsly guys. srsly
*Lunasta shoots the decanter away from Colgate "I thought I shot this away from you last time?"
<Colgate> ahha! but I still have my shotglass!
<Colgate> and my beer mug!
<Lunasta> I love how peabnuts is only connected to one other person
<GraphiteLuck> 1 bourbon, 1 shoot, 1 beer
*Colgate blames Berry Punch
<Beatline> Colgate is awesome
*Lunasta shoots away all containers of alquihol from Colgate
<GraphiteLuck> at the moment it seems I'm only connected to two, heh. I actually kinda don't get the connections sometimes
*Colgate cries as her jug of vodka goes flying away from her.
<Glacymr> 12hi SilverSonic
<Colgate> Why are you protecting me from Berry Punch's lifestyle? It is one filed with joy and carelessness!
*Nightseas gives Glacymr a cookie
*Glacymr noms
<Lunasta> Because drinking is bad, mmmkay?
<Spitfire> Mmmmkay kids
<BlacklightShining> lol, Colgate
<Colgate> But she protects her kids so well
<Sketch> look at this drink, this drink is amazing, give it a lick
<BlacklightShining> [00:45] • Colgate is highly considering using this nick for the rest of his life
<BlacklightShining> [00:45] • Colgate is also drunk, so this may not be true
<BlacklightShining> lol ^
<BlacklightShining> *
*Lunasta realizes that he has been shooting buckshot and not the mini-muffin slugs
<Colgate> shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I'm not ddrunk, I'm just uh.... something
<Colgate> something not drunk!
*Colgate is not a very good liar.
<Beatline> You're undrunkified!
*Lunasta loads up a new prototype shotgun shell: the candy cane flechette
<Lunasta> This can and will hurt much more than my usual mini-muffin slugs.
*Colgate likes muffins, but not baked bads
<Lunasta> !mail DerpyBot A box of mini-muffin slugs
<DerpyBot> For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
<Lunasta> Yes!
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!

<Sathi> and going to the vet with one of my cats for the annual checkup
<Polarfire> ah. What time is it over there? I know UK is 6 hours ahead of me but not sure about the mainland.
<Lunasta> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btSH-8x_OhA
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about MLP - Sweet Apple Acres TV Commercial
<Lunasta> Surprisingly well made
<Colgate> that was a weird vid
*Colgate gets all her apples from SAA anyways.
<Sathi> 9:57
<Polarfire> 3 am :)
<Polarfire> So I just have to remember you are 1 hour ahead of the UK.
<Polarfire> I got it : D
<Lunasta> Off to game I shall, so be a dear and be a pal!
<Colgate> what game?
<Sathi> I just hate timezones
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> Zis one
<Polarfire> eeyup.
<Sathi> Was hoping to stream now but gonna need some more help with setting stuff up
*Polarfire agrees
<Colgate> well, at least you got the color right :D
<GraphiteLuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUEaSIaHQJQ

<Polarfire> What all do you have set up so far?
<GraphiteLuck> heh, dunno how that got into my head
<Colgate> I doubt pnies did it!
<Sathi> well I need this VaC program but configuring it takes time
<GraphiteLuck> I do as well
<DJMidli> gnight crazy people

<Sathi> just curious what are you doing up at 4 am in the morning?
<Sathi> or wait 3 am
<Polarfire> not sleeping, that's for sure XD
<Colgate> mriopaint
<Colgate> I miss that game
<Polarfire> I dunno really.
<Polarfire> just not sleepy I guess.
<Sathi> sorry wished I could put something on for you.. but I cant atm.. or its without audio
<Polarfire> its ok :)
<Polarfire> Thankyou for the offer
<Sathi> your welcome
<Beatline> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH3IU4QzqQY&feature=related
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Advanced Mario Sequencer - MLP: Friendship Is Magic theme (rock edition)
<Beatline> Ahh
<Sathi> hopefuly I get stuff sorted out tonight with Sprinkles
<Rayne> advanced mario sequencer?
<Polarfire> I wish you good luck
<GraphiteLuck> *shrug* never heard of it, but it seems to still be mario paint
<GraphiteLuck> plus it was a pretty good theme
<Polarfire> hmm I wish it was cloudy here.
*Colgate has a headache
<Polarfire> I mean its dark right now but....
*Colgate thinks another shot will solve the problem
*Colgate knows he is wrong, but does it anyways
<GraphiteLuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qmlWm-3tl0&feature=related
<Beatline> A shot of water, yes. xP
<Polarfire> During the day its very hot, my area is in a terrible drought right now.
<Colgate> o no, it would take much more than a shot of water for how much I've drank tonight
<Sathi> Sorry to hear that ever been to europe?
<Polarfire> I have not. Wish I could go though.
<Beatline> A few gallons?
<Polarfire> IIRC you have lived in the US before right?
*GraphiteLuck listens to Moldova song contest (where epic sax guy came from)
<Colgate> not that much water, but a lot!
<Beatline> *shrug*
*Colgate is reconsidering RPing ponies
<Beatline> Just drink some water at some point, it'll feel better
<Colgate> Ill think about it tomorrow when Im sober :D
<Sathi> I was born there
<Octavia> you have successfully fulfilled your 'why is it when you are drunk it is all you can think about' quota.
<Sathi> but kinda traveled all around the globe with my parents at young age
<Colgate> hey, no stealing my quotes!
<Polarfire> Ah.
<Polarfire> I see.
<GraphiteLuck> lol
*Colgate still blames Berry Punch for getting him drunk
<Beatline> xD
<Octavia> that is why i quoted it
<Beatline> Him?
<Polarfire> So do you have a good memory of the US?
<Colgate> her, it, whatever!
<Sathi> I was thinking to return there at some point
<Sathi> still got a double nationality
<Colgate> it's hard RPing a female char as a male :(
<Octavia> Colgate is transgender. Haa.
<GraphiteLuck> your probably just thinking too hard about it
*Octavia rumormills!
<GraphiteLuck> really fillies and colts aren't that different - in my experience anyway
<Colgate> I'm thinking too hard? while drunk? probably not
<GraphiteLuck> lol, true
<Colgate> I think I'm doing a lot of... not thinking?
<Polarfire> Oh that's cool. What counrty are you in right now?
<Colgate> is there a word for that?
<Sathi> netherlands
<Polarfire> How does it compare to the US? I've never been to Europe, just wondering how it is to someone who's lived both places
<Beatline> Erm... Absent-minded?
<GraphiteLuck> drunk minded?
<stripes> wow netherlands..thats why its so great chating on irc, you meet folks from everywhere :)
*Beatline RPs four female characters as a male, btw. Though admittedly not drunk...
<Polarfire> ohey again Stripes
<Colgate> I've RPed female chars in tabletop games before, but not on teh internetz
<Colgate> it just feels.... so different
<Polarfire> Stripes is an Aussie, I'm jealous
<Colgate> internet vs IRL
<Colgate> I mean
<GraphiteLuck> You know, I was talking about this earlier to some friends. I wonder if growing up doing a lot of text-only based chatting if it sets your mindset to be more gender nuetral
<Polarfire> Hey stripes what time is it over there?
<GraphiteLuck> in a lot of cases I don't know anyone in a particular chat's gender. Nor do I really care to
<Sathi> hello stripes
*GraphiteLuck shrugs
<Sathi> Well drugs is legalized here... (for now)
<Beatline> I feel the same way.
<Polarfire> XD all drugs?
<Colgate> that is true, I don't generally care about a person's gender, just their ideals and what their opinions are
<Sathi> if I speak to american people that's the first they ask me...
<Sathi> do you live in Amsterdam?
<Colgate> I defniitely grew up on the internet too...
<Sathi> me; no
<Beatline> I really actively associate my persona to each gender
<GraphiteLuck> indeed. Especially text only based chatting it seems you learn to concern yourself with thoughts, personality and opinion, gender aside. Way aside.
<Sathi> nah just softdrugs of course
<Polarfire> ah.
<Polarfire> Well that's certianly interesting.
<Colgate> I don't really see why people bring gender up into most conversations, unless it is about copulating... but other than that, it shouldnt matter imo
<GraphiteLuck> I'm curious on wether more internet influence in our lives (this generation - assuming we are all relatively close-ish in age) contributes to our open mindedness about people and their lifestyles. Getting to know people first on other levels
<GraphiteLuck> I agree Colgate
<Polarfire> any other notable differences?
<GraphiteLuck> especially with such variations on thoughts and opinions.
*GraphiteLuck shrugs
<GraphiteLuck> just musing
<GraphiteLuck> hello HeatWave
<HeatWave> Hi.
<stripes> sorry just went for nomnoms..
<Sathi> Well as O said i'm considering moving back to the USA at some point
<stripes> it is 625pm
<Sathi> I hate timezones don't you stripes?
<GraphiteLuck> additionally, I think I will now go retrieve a drink. 'prolly sweat tea with sweat tea vodka
<GraphiteLuck> it shall be fun
<Colgate> whee, you can join me!
<GraphiteLuck> indeed!
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Fallout Equestria: Project Horizons (Update Part 11) (http://tinyurl.com/44feyrk)
<Octavia> sweat tea?
<Octavia> sounds hideous.
*FallSilently must agree
<Polarfire> Sathi how long have you lived in the netherlands?
<GraphiteLuck> oh gosh, sweet tea
<GraphiteLuck> that was a terrible, terrible typo
<GraphiteLuck> lol
<Beatline> I've kinda actually drifted from knowing people at all because on tge internet I can learn people without physical constrictions, though the failure of others to do it IRL really makes it hard for it to be an actually pleasurable experience.
<Beatline> [/late]
<FallSilently> Is that a good thing?
<Sathi> hmm when I was 12 my parents decided to buy a house in the netherlands. My dad quit his job for AT&T and started his own IT services company and I needed
<Sathi> and i'm making huge spelling errors
<Sathi> too early
<Sathi> :D
<Polarfire> lol
<Colgate> dpends I suppose
*Colgate goes into high philosophical drunk mode
<Beatline> Tl;dr: I see most people as dickwads because of that.
*Octavia laughs ^
<Beatline> *shrug*
<GraphiteLuck> hmm
<Fireant> Good MORNING Equestria!
<GraphiteLuck> I think it does make me feel like people are being largely superficial IRL
<Polarfire> well good luck with whatever you decide to do. I imagine it is a tough decision to switch countries.
<FallSilently> Good morning Fireant.
<Beatline> People are too damn shallow.
<Beatline> ^
<Colgate> it would mean, based on evolution, that we are now evolving based on mental traits and not physical traits
<GraphiteLuck> but I suppose that's what gets you to know them
<Balloons> Morning robbin wi... i mean fireant.
<GraphiteLuck> 'morning Fireant
<Colgate> for better or for worse
<Octavia> Good morning, Fireant.
<GraphiteLuck> I kinda like that Graphite
<Sathi> Well it will happen at some point.. Just not sure yet when
<BlacklightShining> 'morning, Fireant
<GraphiteLuck> >>I kinda like that Colgate
<Sathi> Did you ever think about relocating?
<FallSilently> Actually, I suspect that this online interraction, stripped of physical preconditions, makes those preconditions all the more obvious in real life.
<stripes> timezones, yes.
<stripes> also internet lag lol
<Fireant> Octavia, sweetie.
<Fireant> I have something for you.
<GraphiteLuck> I suppose it can. I think it can work the opposite way too though, help you see beyond them even if they are obvious
<Polarfire> Not switching countries, no. If I had no family I would move to south america.
<Octavia> Oh? What is it, dear?
<Fireant> http://tinyurl.com/3dq6dfy
<Colgate> that can bee good or bad though, we might devolve physically into something... weak> I can't think that straight right now -.-
<Sathi> Why south america?
<Polarfire> you can literally work until you are 30, retire, and live there the rest of your life.
<GraphiteLuck> nice Fireant
<Beatline> A car?
<Octavia> My own car? Awesome!
<Sathi> geez i'm soon too old then
<Beatline> How generous
<Polarfire> your money automatically triples or something like that.
<Colgate> octavuia card woot
<Colgate> woah, 2 typos in 3 word, ims on a roll!
<stripes> geez i would have retired years ago then lol
<BlacklightShining> lol
<Polarfire> b/c most countries down there are poorer countries, so your money goes a lot farther
<Octavia> !roll 1derp6
<Fireant> Octavia Car is sadly not that good :(
<FallSilently> You guys are just a bunch of letters to me. I don't care if you're male or female, fifteen or fifty, all that matters is your ability to communicate. But in real life, the first thing I see is someone's gender. Based on their appearance, I'll have an idea of their personality.
<Octavia> that is unfortunate.
<Fireant> BUT still, its *sunglasses* A Ride In Octavia.
<BlacklightShining> !roll d6
<Polarfire> but I could never leave my family.
<Colgate> FallSilently: sorry if I'm failing you right now with this drunkeness :(
<BlacklightShining> Octavia: you rolled 1
*Octavia is definitely derp'd, then.
<Sathi> never ever?
<GraphiteLuck> interestingly enough, gender is like.. maybe the 4th thing I notice, but that, I'm sure is just me
<FallSilently> Don't worry. Drunk philosophers are on my level :)
<Beatline> I notice them, but don't use them as judging factors.
<Balloons> If you have a pony name, i imagine you as that pony 6_9
<Polarfire> probably not. And by leave I mean move to a different country.
<Colgate> "sexiness factor: is the first thing I notice, then gender, then personality, usually at least
<^RainbowDash> Wait
<Colgate> when talking to people irl
<^RainbowDash> You notice sexiness before gender? 9.6
*Colgate is bi
<Octavia> gender does not stop everyone
<GraphiteLuck> I do too, lol, or at least. how well they take care of themselves, their height, etc
<^RainbowDash> Erm... I mean, different factors determine sexiness on the different genders...
*Octavia wants to go out drinking with GraphiteLuck one day.
*GraphiteLuck would welcome that with open hooves
<Sathi> I see what you mean
<^RainbowDash> I'd find it more of a simeultaneous thing, but eh
<Polarfire> I would love to travel and see other countries though
<GraphiteLuck> It's actually interesting. In my line of work I card people; a lot. I actually find I look at eyes first. Every time. They really are windows to the soul
*Octavia does not care about anything other than personality. Do not be a weenie and we are cool.
<stripes> yupers visiting would be nice
<Colgate> well, the first thing I think of is how "jpt" someone looks
<GraphiteLuck> they really, really tell you how old someone is. How much they have been through. How tired or bright they are
<FallSilently> jpt?
<Colgate> er... jpt... lolz
<Colgate> "hot"
<stripes> i love old ships, so i want to visit all the museums with old ships in them
<Colgate> I r bad typer
<FallSilently> I see.
<^RainbowDash> Not to mention I'm surrounded by homophobia in a way. "He's gay, he must be an abomination of nature, let's taunt them until they're depressed to the point of suicide!"
<Sathi> then you would love holland ;)
<Polarfire> I like south america. The people there are very laid back, like me XD
<BitZero> I'll keep silent on my take in this matter.
<FallSilently> How mysterious.
<Polarfire> Stripes we have an old navy battleship near my area. They have it open for tours and such.
<stripes> u505 in illinois, hms victory in portsmouth and the old river monitors in paraguay and brazill
<Colgate> the NW US is very liberal about sexuality, which I'm glad for
<User_9663> Hai gaise
<stripes> where is you Polarfire
<^RainbowDash> It's happened, though luckily I steer clear of the cliques who are THAT intolerant.
<stripes> ?
<GraphiteLuck> it does indeed take me a while to consider gender though. I generally notice their style of clothing, their gait, any opening gestures, their body type
<Balloons> Hello 9663
<Polarfire> Specifically, Tejas
<GraphiteLuck> hello 9663
<FallSilently> Mornin'
<User_9663> Still
<Colgate> User_9663 is my favorite person in the world
<User_9663> TIME TO SHOW WHO I REALLY AM
*Colgate glmps User_9663
<FallSilently> Ew
<Polarfire> Tejas is the old Spanish name for Texas
<Insidious_Lars> Hai gaise
<FallSilently> How insidious of you.
*Colgate is still glomping Insidious_Lars
<Fireant> OH NO
<Fireant> ITS INSIDIOUS!
<Fireant> MUST KICK! :O
<Insidious_Lars> Hai
*Fireant is searching for his kick button!
<BlacklightShining> lol
<Insidious_Lars> Oh god no
<BlacklightShining> watch out, Insidious_Lars!
<Polarfire> And Stripes you really know your stuff! I'm impressed
<Fireant> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/221/d/5/tortoise_and_the_mare_by_yikomega-d45yo7x.png
<BlacklightShining> you may want to wait unit right before he hits return, then /nick to something else
<Fireant> MY GOD
<Fireant> SO CUTE
*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out Fireant's shouting
<Fireant> o3o
<BlacklightShining> good luck knowing when that is, though…
<GraphiteLuck> d'aww
<Octavia> i am about as non-judging as someone can be. I do not care what you look like, how you dress, what your preferences are.. I just like good people to talk to, if you can avoid being a douche then it is good with me.
<Coz> >>
<Colgate> taht pic is cutastic
<BlacklightShining> …lolwut?
<^RainbowDash> I'm generally pansexual, but again my tendency towards looking at most of the people around me as dickwads renders me kind of avoidant of relationships beyond friends.
<^RainbowDash> Anyway
<Octavia> omg derpy <3
<Polarfire> Well I think I might go soon. Time zones are stupid.
<^RainbowDash> D'awww.
<GraphiteLuck> I'm about as gender nuetral bisexual as you get. Which is why I probably look at a lot of other things first
<Sathi> getting sleepy hmm?
<FallSilently> I saw that on the art roundup. Very cute indeed.
<Dragoran> fucking indos
<Polarfire> its nearing 4 am ;)
<RePod> \o/
*Dragoran slaps Drake
<stripes> hehe 4am
<Dragoran> heya RePod
<RePod> soup
<Dragoran> want to have a crack at exploiting EpicStatsGuy?
<Insidious_Lars> That
<RePod> maybe
<stripes> so uss texas is near you then Polarfire ...
<Insidious_Lars> Is cute
<Dragoran> I need someone other than myself to try
<GraphiteLuck> by the way. If anyone is ever looking at the vodka shelf and is wondering how Absolut Wild tea vodka tastes:
<Colgate> yeah, I'm that way too. I never look at gender first
<Polarfire> and we've got 3:40 10:40, and 6:40.
<Insidious_Lars> But I remember seeing that on Drawfriend Stuff
<GraphiteLuck> it overpowers -anything- you try to mix with it to taste like tea
<Dragoran> !sneas
*Sneas now belongs to Dragoran for 23 minutes
<stripes> wow thats great
<Polarfire> Timezones are just stoopid.
<Sneas> 03buttrape
<Insidious_Lars> AND BE RIGHT BACK FOR MOTHER 3
*Colgate sticsk to unflavored vodka
<GraphiteLuck> so really, the only way to mix it is with lemonaide or tea as far as I can tell
<stripes> thats the oldest usa battleship in existance i think
*FallSilently doesn't drink, but thanks
<BlacklightShining> ^
<Colgate> but... drinking is fun!
<Polarfire> we've got the USS Lexington, that's the one I was telling you about.
<Colgate> you get into awesome convos about drinking
<Insidious_Lars> I don't drink
<Colgate> and stuff like that!
<Insidious_Lars> Religion and such
<Donitz> drinking is cool, til you want to puke
<Donitz> then you puke and it's cool again
<stripes> lexington, thats an www2 aircraft carrier isnt it...
<Colgate> if you puke, you drank too much
<Polarfire> yep
<Colgate> and you just wasted alcohol
<Donitz> or too fast
<Donitz> or just drank something lame
<Colgate> (hasnt puked from alcohol in years)
<FallSilently> By not drinking, I get into depressingly repetitive conversations about me not drinking.
<Polarfire> They couldn't sink it. Tried and hit like 4 different times and it would never go down.
<GraphiteLuck> eh, I don't judge
<Drake> 04o-o
*Drake slaps Dragoran
<Polarfire> it would come back, get fixed, then go back out again.
<GraphiteLuck> it's not for some people. For whatever reason they have; it's usually a good one
<Polarfire> The Japanese nicknamed it the ghost ship
*Dragoran slaps back
<Colgate> if somepony doesn't want to drink, that's cool
<Colgate> they can be my DD -.-
<Umbreon> 12Dragoran
<Dragoran> yo
<Umbreon> 12finally you arivve
<GraphiteLuck> I do like the conversations though.
<Dragoran> .-.
<Umbreon> 12stop hiding from me ;-;
<Drake> 04o-o
<Dragoran> ._.
<FallSilently> Yes, I don't mind constantly being the DD.
<Dragoran> i'm getting on PO
<Polarfire> you were right stripes
<Umbreon> 12http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n174/MysticHawk/Untitled-4.png?t=1312965964
<Polarfire> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Texas_%28BB-35%29
<Umbreon> 12LOL
<GraphiteLuck> heya Kein
<Umbreon> 12i misread that as "i'm getting PO"
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<Colgate> < is generally DD also, because drinking at bars is *expensive*
<Insidious_Lars> Still having the cold
<Polarfire> I like WWII history and technology. Really interesting topic to study.
<GraphiteLuck> sadly it is
<FallSilently> I had a cold three or four weeks ago and still haven't shaken the cough. Good luck with that.
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<Insidious_Lars> Thanks
<Fireant> So
<Polarfire> hmm
<Fireant> Derpy hugging a plushie patchwork turtle is cute, right?
<Fireant> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/221/d/5/tortoise_and_the_mare_by_yikomega-d45yo7x.png
<Polarfire> apparently everyone left XD
<GraphiteLuck> Eeeyup

<FallSilently> Indeed, you mentioned that five minutes ago.

<Sathi> hehe yes you should
<Colgate> a plushie that either FS or RD made!@
<Sathi> will you attend this weeks show?
<Polarfire> I hate to leave good company, but what can I say. Timezones screwed me over.
<stripes> its terible to see the intersting tech that we loose through non presevation/ scapping of items
<FallSilently> Just as long as nobody minds me showing the Awesome Gilda Popsicle Picture
<FallSilently> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XpFp7bA-nC0/TiJA8e1qoQI/AAAAAAAAIhI/eT2cI0bJQ38/s1600/popsicle_by_csimadmax-d3w8u6s.png.jpg

<^RainbowDash> She just... Had it, you know?
<Polarfire> ok I got you.
*^RainbowDash puts on a beret, because she looks hawt in a beret
<FallSilently> Can pegasi even have stuff lying around in their cloud houses? Wouldn't everything fall through?
<Lycan> Well, the pegasi have everything in their livestyles figured out. Including that problem.
<Fireant> Yes.
<Lycan> Wanna know how?
<stripes> thats good i had to look it up to check :)
<Fireant> BECAUSE OF MAGIC.
<Lycan> Cloud computing.
<Lycan> badum tch
<Insidious_Lars> Magic *snort snort*
*Colgate is considering going for the uberman sleep schedule atm
<FallSilently> I can only assume the chat's gone quiet because half of you dies from massive diabetes when I posted that Gilda picture.
<Lycan> What Gilda picHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
<Polarfire> heck, Sathi, I'll be here tomorrow. I hang out here pretty much every day.
<FallSilently> Uberman... good luck with that.

<Colgate> well, I generally only spend 1 night out, so... hrmmm

<Umbreon> 12we tried matching tier
<Umbreon> 12same thing happened

<FallSilently> Gilda is best non-Rarity pony.

<Dragoran> Umbreon, try challenging me
<Colgate> I want chicken now
<Umbreon> 12:P

<^RainbowDash> Heh like this song
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Nightly Roundup #63 (http://tinyurl.com/3eckwhb)
<Ossalaa> wouldn't it make better since for rarity to cut off the other half of the mustache instead of cutting off her tail?
<^BlacklightShining> eeynope
*Colgate decides to do it
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I should actually think of installing that again
<Dragoran> what's your team?
<Ascendant> lol
<Colgate> uberman it is! I'm unemployed atm, why not
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
*Shiny-Growlithe wants to see if a special sprite is in there
<Umbreon> 12i already forfeited
<FallSilently> Then he wouldn't have a moustache.
<Ossalaa> cause now, his mustache is kinda weird looking with one side curly and purple while the other is orange and straight
<Umbreon> 12but if memory recalls i actually do have a team
<FallSilently> What's that?
<FallSilently> The roundup is actually on time??

<Dragoran> That's weird
<B-Man> They drive me to go look up how to use an abacus.
<B-Man> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvsnftXXKdw
<B-Man> Fascinating.
*Colgate doesn't know how to use an abacus
<FallSilently> That Pinkie Pie jockey thing is the most TERRIFYING CONCEPT EVER
<Dragoran> Are you hiding your team?
<Insidious_Lars> Yay for owning a boss!
<Insidious_Lars> Imma celebrate
<B-Man> Colgate: Check the video.
<Ossalaa> jockey pie....yea that is scary
*FallSilently learned abacus in school... am I THAT old?

<Umbreon> 12yes they have
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Dragoran> They have, Shiny
<Dragoran> Can you unhide your team, Umbreon?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Wut
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I can't choose any 5th gen
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And sprites only go up to HG
<Asterisk> Change you thing at the top.
<Asterisk> It says gen or something.
<Insidious_Lars> Finally
<Insidious_Lars> Chapter 3
<Dragoran> Shiny, you need to download the new version :p
<Dragoran> and importing your old team will cause it to fail
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02What bull is that?
<Dragoran> 1.0.23 I think
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Need to learn how to auto-install newer versions
<Dragoran> fucking PO needs to learn about updates
<Dragoran> er

<Sathi> sharing is caring
<stripes> fim!

<Ossalaa> how bad is luna game 0?
<^RainbowDash> Oh my, hexadecimal abacus.
<Dragoran> duh
<Colgate> well, I look at hex all the time, so I t wouldn't be that weird to me, -.-
<Sathi> indeed it is
<GraphiteLuck> hexadecimal abacus, my head went asplode
<Sathi> Australia must be beautiful!
<Sathi> I mean i've seen it on tv
<Sathi> people wake up early in the morning for a fresh dive into the ocean
<Sathi> before they get to work
<Sathi> sounds awesome
<^RainbowDash> Not saying weird, more saying neat.
<Octavia> i thought my nixie clock was neat, but hexidecimal sounds more clever.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02YES
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I can totally use the sprite I love
<Shaico> Everyday I'm shuffling.
<Shaico> And my shuffling summoned Sakura.
<Sakura> 5:20 AM...can't sleep...
<FallSilently> Hellew
<FallSilently> The only solution for that is to stare at a packlit digital screen!
<FallSilently> backlit*
<Sakura> ...eyup...
<B-Man> Colgate: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvsnftXXKdw
<B-Man> Heh, they used it for weights and measures, but still.
<Colgate> I just watched that -.-
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But why can I still not use 5th gen? asdfh;kj'agh'lakjfda
<B-Man> :P
<FallSilently> That would explain why I don't believe I've ever met Sakura before...
<Sakura> Tried to bore myself to sleep by reading and copy-editing a couple of fics, but I just can't get tired....this sucks...
<Nuclear> Hey everyone!
<B-Man> I want to own an abacus now.
<B-Man> Really really badly.
<FallSilently> Hellow Nuke

<Sakura> Gah....freaking Chrome.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I've been sleeping for 3 days, I'm not really that tired
<stripes> plenty of ponies around :)

*Nuclear join #BucketofHolding

<Asterisk> How do you mix up asterisk with dragora-
<Caaz> >.>
<Caaz> Oh god what.
<FallSilently> That works....
<Umbreon> 12i'm so used to her name being armageddon that i just did a tab enter right away
<Umbreon> 12-.-
<Dragoran> ._.
<stripes> thats always a good goal :) bathurst is a nice place, about 30,000 people live here
<User_3431> Ugh I can't think of what to get my pops for his birthday
<Caaz> I do that with Rhyme/RePod sometimes.
<RePod> do what
<Sneas> 03................._..................
<Caaz> see:five lines back.
<Caaz> Okay six.
<Caaz> Or seven.
<Sakura> Well, what does he like or enjoy?
<FallSilently> Mostly people seem to be obsessing over abaci at the moment.
<User_3431> He loves jazz singers but I want to do something different other than a music album

<Sathi> What do you do for living?
<User_3431> That's a good idea I'll have to look into it
<^BlacklightShining> …don't you ponies read topics?
<FallSilently> Tickets to something?

<Dragoran> It's good he got to it before some other asshole did
<FallSilently> What happened where?
<Sakura> I usually lurk, copyedit fics, and generally keep to myself most of the time. Just, too bloody wired right now to sleep - so here I am.
<Insidious_Lars> Okay
<Insidious_Lars> So
<SillyNilly> I am in the same boat Sakura
<Insidious_Lars> Eh

<Asterisk> Nobody cares about perl
*Shaico is reading Past Sins before he departs from this chat again.
<Caaz> Bitches love perl

<Caaz> Cause it's like a llama.
<Asterisk> Repod make him EpicStatsGuy op me
<Asterisk> Can you do it
<Caaz> Everyone hates java, cause it's like an alligator.
<Sakura> Been working my way backwards through the series.
<RePod> I could.
<Insidious_Lars> Call me Lars
<Asterisk> Prove it
<Sakura> Righto.

<Nuclear> Hiya Lars
<Persian> Possibly.

<FallSilently> Here we go....
<Ludovician> oh saw that one earlier
*Persian roll.
<Balloons> I despise that animation so much.
<Ludovician> losing braincells from that is entirely plausible
<Twinkletoes> I thought it was pretty funny
<Insidious_Lars> Oh
<Sakura> Funny the first time....each successive time afterward, "Why haven't I closed this yet?"
<Umbreon> 12well Dragoran
<Ludovician> ya
<Insidious_Lars> FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC BITCH" ?
<FallSilently> It's funny but it's constantly being referenced.
<stripes> what about you Sathi ?
<Ludovician> even the first one they dragged out too long
<Sakura> "Maybe it'll get better....maybe it'll.....get.....okay, where's the vodka?"
<Ludovician> yea that one lars
<Sneas> 03bye
<Twinkletoes> At least it isn't getting referenced as much as cupcakes
<Dragoran> seeya >:
<Umbreon> 12i discovered something
<FallSilently> It may yet.
<Ludovician> All ya have to do is take a dash of rainbow, put it in the mix...
<johnsey> cupcakes, so sweet and tasty...
*lolwork hates early days lol
<Balloons> :|
<Twinkletoes> Hopefully not, all the talk I see about cupcakes really gets annoying
<Sakura> That made me think of a really funny mash-up I saw on youtube a while back.
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<Ludovician> I havent actually read cupcakes but heard all kinda of bad stuff about it
<Twinkletoes> Have you seen the darth vader pinkie pie mashup?
<Twinkletoes> It's an over rated gore fic
<Nuclear> Darth Vader
<Nuclear> LOL
<Twinkletoes> Not really worth your time
<Asterisk> Holy shit sneas
<FallSilently> The Darth Vader thing is an overrated gore fic!?
<Asterisk> It's not even 6 yet
<Ludovician> I think twinkle was talking about cupcakes
<Asterisk> Where do you work
<FallSilently> I've seen the Darth Vader thing. Creepily hilarious.
<SillyNilly> No silly, it is Darth Vader & Pinkie Pie shipping. I think..?
<Umbreon> 12is Dragoran interested in what i discovered?
<Twinkletoes> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRYE9mVcNh0
*Sakura loads up Youtube and grins, "Whoever thought to put this together was brilliant...and I hate rap..."
<Twinkletoes> no it's this
<RePod> is it a bot exploit
<Ludovician> ah k
<Ludovician> wait what?
<SillyNilly> Oh.

<Ludovician> hi pyroh
<SurgicalArts> That's funny, I saw that wallpaper like 3 times already
<Lunasta> Heyo Pyroh
<Dragoran> well, I don't think it parses identifiers or variables
<^RainbowDash> The parennts are in existence, just not presence
<Nuclear> OHAI PYROH!
<Dragoran> because just reprinting $2 etc. doesn't do that
<RePod> that's why I'm trying to break out of that limitation
<killerrabbit> I have my wallpapers randomized on startup :d
<Pyroh> Hello EveryPony

<User_2358> cupcakez better than browniez
<Pyroh> I dunno 12?
<Persian> Noobs kicking ass at go, what is this sorcery.
<Lycan> How many fanfic authors can claim that their work has people making custom pony figures based on their characters?
<Vexed> idk brownies are pretty amazing
<Lawdee> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpxnUUi-Mmw
<Dragoran> o-o?

<Lycan> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/43359
<Persian> Whenever that image uploads..
<Pyroh> Owell, i have my molotov's
<Pyroh> :3
<RePod> FOUR OH FOUR
<Vexed> oooh
<Ludovician> what are they from?
<Vexed> what fanfic is that from?
<Vexed> yeah that.
<Lycan> Calamity and Velvet Remedy. From Fallout: Equestria.
<Ludovician> cool
<Pyroh> Eyup
<Persian> uploading sooooo slow.
<Persian> okay go!
<Vexed> I've been meaning to read that
<Pyroh> m suprised there isnt a youtube channel caleld velvetremedy
<Pyroh> called*
<Vexed> but it looks SO long
<Pyroh> Vexed
<Pyroh> Its worth it
<Vexed> ?
<Pyroh> Trust me
<Lycan> Pretty good read, if only cuz it's got a complex story.
<Sketchy_Sounds> That's what she said
<Lycan> Like...
<Pyroh> I just want more of those animated comics
<Pyroh> They were awesome
<Lycan> It's got so much lore and backstory to it.
<Vexed> is it already finished? or Is the author still writing?
<Pyroh> Ya, poor lil pip
<Lycan> With the Zebras and the ministaries and such.
<Pyroh> Always getting shot at or crushed or beaten
<Pyroh> Or something
<Pyroh> While velevet just kinda hangs in the backround
<Lycan> And yes. The main characters getting hurt is like daily routine. The author stays true to Fallout. XD
<Pyroh> Eyup
<Pyroh> Its like 70% of the conflict
<Ludovician> If I've never played fallout, would I miss out on much?
<Pyroh> No
<Pyroh> Not really

*RePod renuke
*Umbreon now belongs to Dragoran for 9 minutes
<Pyroh> Your up to speed
<Vexed> how does a quadraped use a firearm?
<Lycan> He's pretty much integrated the themes of Friendship is Magic into a workable Fallout universe.
<Pyroh> They fire with there tounges
<Pyroh> Duh
<Lycan> Magic. Literally. Or tongues.
<Ludovician> the recoil's gotta hurt
<Lycan> XD
<Pyroh> Eyup
<Vexed> srsly
<Pyroh> im so glad Derpy survived :3
<Vexed> spoilers!
<Pyroh> So wahts with ghouls anyways?
<Ludovician> SPOILERS

<Ludovician> just kidding
*Lycan tells the world that I'mma firin' mah lazah
<Pyroh> Its in lik chapter 6
<Pyroh> or something
<icefire> what would be a real spoiler is what HAPPENS to derpy
<Lycan> Yes. I'd say Fallout Equestria is my favorite fanfic.
<Lycan> At first, I was pretty skeptical. Almost stopped reading it after about the first few chapters. I'm glad I didn't .
<Vexed> I'm looking for fanfic recomendations. Are there any other good ones?
<Lycan> Like the first two or three.
<Jazza> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCccHZQeg10

<Vexed> Vodka burns best
<Pyroh> Bye
<Vexed> so, anyother fanfic recomendations?
<icefire> Past sins
<icefire> I guess
<Lycan> Hm. I liked the first Silent Ponyville.
<Dragoran> !umbreon
*Umbreon still belongs to Dragoran for 5 more minutes
<icefire> That battletech one is pretty good
<stripes> no thanlies
<Lycan> Had a really great ending. Multiple endings, in fact.
<stripes> i no need coffee, i need to get to the hay shed soon for sleepies
<Lycan> The second one is slowly growing on me.
<Jazza> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYdJT_KY5_s
<Sathi> Ohh
<Sathi> sweet dreams I wish you then
<Lycan> Past Sins is... love or hate. It seems a lot of bronies don't like it. I can sort of understand why I suppose. It's a pretty sensitive topic among the fanbase right now.
<Lycan> Everyone seems all too eager to argue over it.
<Lycan> :|
<Lawdee> I'M BACK
<Balloons> Haven't read it but i can easily see it's one of the most talked about fics here.
<icefire> if you don't like OC's or drama you won't like it
<Lycan> I'M FRONT
<Lawdee> Did you forget about me?
<Lawdee> You did didn't you
<Lawdee> fffff
<Lycan> Who are you again?
<FreezeFrame> good morning and seeya, cause it's time for me to head to work.
<Jazza> Is this a legitimate Fox News story? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THlvkIEFMqQ
<Sathi> later FreezeFrame
<Sathi> in and out hmm?
<Vexed> I'm in the middle of Past Sins
<Vexed> Not really sure what could be controversal about it.
<Insidious_Lars> siff
<Insidious_Lars> Hm
<Lycan> Personally, I think some people are just jealous.
<Vexed> jealous of what? Of who?
<Owloysius> Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
<Lycan> That their OC stories aren't as popular as Past Sins.
<Vexed> hmm
<Lunasta> ooh
<Lunasta> Let's see where I am now
<Lycan> That and critics might be bronies, but they're still critics.
<stripes> okies well night night everypony
<Insidious_Lars> Yay update
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<Lunasta> YES! 5 more spots!
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<Lunasta> I'm climbing back up the ladder woot
<Insidious_Lars> Still no advance?
<Insidious_Lars> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<Lycan> >_> For the record, I like Silver Bell better than Nix.
<Lycan> Silver Bell from Fallout Equestria.
<Lycan> Just saiyan' :D
<Vexed> she's so adorable though
<Vexed> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h_3_0SO652c/Tj2yAX1fY0I/AAAAAAAAJ7E/1niZm3WGE3M/s1600/twilight+and+nyx.png

<icefire> nyx gets smaller every tiem someone draws fanart of her
<DesertRose> OMG YES PAST SINS
<Lycan> inb4fanhatecomesfloodingin
<DesertRose> YES YES YES YES YES
<Vexed> I
<Vexed> 'm still not sure what they could complain about.
<Sathi> nighty
<DesertRose> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpgy21r_dRE
<Sathi> sweet dreams
<Vexed> maybe I need to finish it first.
<Balloons> Poeple complain about everything.
<stripes> thankies
<Balloons> people*
<Vexed> it's true
<Lycan> Exactly.
<DesertRose> its human nature to complain
<Lycan> Well, Silver Bell being a background character, I doubt I can find an aD'AWWWWWWWWWWWable pic to rival that...
<Lycan> But if you know her story... well...
<Lycan> Yeah.

<RePod> get out caaz
<^RainbowDash> Magic!
<Persian> It has a sideways mouth, don't stare at him.
<^RainbowDash> x3
*Lawdee *snort snort*
<Balloons> "They'll shower us with Diamonds!"
<Persian> He's shy about it and all. ALL HE WANTED TO BE WAS A CUTE EMOTION.
<Lycan> And I don't wanna talk to a unicorn! Y'all muthabuckas lyin' and earnin' mah scorn!
<Lawdee> buckin' voice crack
<Lawdee> how is it so cute

<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Ludovician> yep
<Sketchy_Sounds> Dash's best moment in Best Night Ever is her fangirl squee IMO. XD
<Lycan> Can't figure out how magnetism works. Must be magic, and the scientists are just lying to us, even though they've got PHDs they've worked hard for many years to earn! Makes sense!
<Persian> But yeah don't stare at him.
<Persian> Or you'll be next.
<Persian> oDo
<RePod> get out caaz
<Ludovician> Best Night Ever is the first time I really saw the feminine side in RD

*^RainbowDash kneels shortly before standing up
*Celestia glares at Shaico
*Nuclear bumps into the wall...
<Lunasta> WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THINGS EQUESTRIAN IS THIS?! 3D?!
<Jazza> 3D!!!!
*Shaico grins sheepishly.
<Lawdee> Those costumes are horrible bah
<Jazza> Better than what I have
<Jazza> NOTHING
<Nuclear> Fusile........
*Gilda is now registered and ALL AWESOME.
*DerpyBot stands behind Jazza, glowering
<Shaico> Full length MLP FiM movie.

<Lunasta> !seen Lunasta
<DerpyBot> Lunasta: Silly filly, your eyes are all derpy. Lunasta is in the channel.
<Nuclear> Again I didn't even do anything wrong....
*Sketchy_Sounds giggles at the addition of Pinkie at the end of that vid
<Nuclear> Planes havent flown in days.....
<Untamed> !seen Derpybot
<DerpyBot> Look into my eyes.. 6_9
*DerpyBot puts her front hooves on Untamed's shoulders.
<Gilda> !seen Pinkie Pie
<DerpyBot> Gilda: Sorry, I haven't seen Pie lately.
<Nuclear> Oh.......
<Lunasta> I dunno if I wanna keep these candy cane flechettes or to stick with my mini-muffin slugs
<Gilda> !Seen Pinkie_Pie
<DerpyBot> Gilda: The last time I saw Pinkie_Pie was Sat 30 Jul 2011 03:18:35 PM CEST
<^RainbowDash> Ugh, I need coffee, but there's none left in tge house and it's thundering something fierce out there.
<Untamed> 6_9 Muffiiinss
<Nuclear> !seen Dexter
<DerpyBot> Nuclear: Sorry, I haven't seen Dexter lately.
<Lawdee> She's never seen pie
<Sketchy_Sounds> What time zone is DerpyBot using?
<Ludovician> !seen clearly
<^RainbowDash> !seen ^PinkiePie
<DerpyBot> Ludovician: Sorry, I haven't seen clearly lately.
<DerpyBot> ^RainbowDash: The last time I saw ^PinkiePie was Mon 08 Aug 2011 12:16:58 AM CEST
<Gilda> Celestia Time
<Sketchy_Sounds> Cos I know it's not Central European Summer Time
<Untamed> Rainbowdash You should probably do something about them clouds then
<johnsey> Sketchy_Sounds: it says in the message
<Lunasta> RD, snort some sugar :P
<johnsey> CEST
<Lawdee> What place is the server of this site hosted in anyway
<^RainbowDash> Ick.
<Gilda> Pacific Time
<johnsey> that's Central European Summer Time.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ahh Pacific. OK.
<^RainbowDash> I'm not ever going to snort anything
<johnsey> no it's not pacific
<johnsey> see above :)
<Nuclear> Bill Clinton was not only a president and a war hero, but also a Pimp, and a Brony!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh wait actually
<Gilda> Owloysius is on Sentral time.
<^RainbowDash> Eslecially sinceI'm prone to nosebleeds...
<Gilda> Central
<^RainbowDash> Ugh.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I suppose it could be CEST now I think on it. It's just confusing me because it's an hour ahead of me.
<Lawdee> summer time?
<Lawdee> Time differs in winter and summer
<Lawdee> whaaat
<^RainbowDash> Well, I should at least eat something
<Lawdee> we've been time traveling all along
<Untamed> Just finished playing Luna Game 0
<Untamed> Not bad
*Nuclear control panel startup........
<^RainbowDash> "Not bad"? Blah
<Lawdee> How 'bout a cupcake ^RainbowDash?
<Balloons> Luna Game?
<Untamed> It was pretty good
<Sketchy_Sounds> !seen Octavia
<DerpyBot> Sketchy_Sounds: The last time I saw Octavia was Wed 10 Aug 2011 11:57:08 AM CEST
*Nuclear order pony pizza......
<Balloons> I honestly didn't know there was a game with Luna :S
<Gilda> Oh so it IS Europe time
<Nuclear> Hi MrPoniator
<MrPoniator> Hello
*^RainbowDash looks at Lawdee. {What is it with everypony offering me cupcakes?!}
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hmm. Missed her by half an hour.
<Lawdee> :3
<^RainbowDash> Balloons
<johnsey> why did I even included the time zone in the message if you people don't read it :P
<^RainbowDash> Avoid it. xP
<Balloons> Why?
<Gilda> Why is it set to Europe time when the Blog is on Pacific?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Lolz, I'm just used to the time zone always being behind mine.
<^RainbowDash> It's just a pop-scare
<Lawdee> I wonder when the show will be dubbed to Dutch
<Lawdee> it has to happen
<Lawdee> inevitable
<johnsey> Gilda: no specific reason, except that it's the time zone derpy runs in.
<Gilda> Well that does explain it a bit.
<Lawdee> Derpy is european
<Lawdee> DISCOVERY
<Balloons> ^RainbowDash: oh, well then thanks for the warning :)
<Sketchy_Sounds> I wonder what nationality she is.
<Nuclear> *Reminiscence*
<Lawdee> err
<Gilda> She's from Antderp.
<Lawdee> Equestrian...?
<johnsey> equestrian.
<Sketchy_Sounds> =p
<Lawdee> but equestria is like
<Lawdee> their earth
<Lawdee> right
<Sketchy_Sounds> Equestria's in South Africa
<^RainbowDash> You're welcome. It's not really spectacular or anything
<johnsey> she's only staying in Germany at the moment
<Lunasta> I thought Equestria was in France
<Lawdee> hon hon hon
<Gilda> Shaico!
<Lunasta> Shai dun derpd
<johnsey> but she didn't pick up a new nationality because of it
<^RainbowDash> ?!
*Gilda slams Shaico against the wall
<Gilda> Explain "waifu!" What have you been telling these ponies?
<^RainbowDash> ?!?!
*Fireant slams Gilda against the floor, reaching to her nethers with lewd face!
<Lawdee> oh what the hay
<Lawdee> Should I even be here
*Nuclear sleeps along the grasslands of Ponyville only to be awakened by the bizarre trembling that jolted the landscape......
*Lunasta wonders if anyone has considered an uprising to take down the godmod Fireant
*^RainbowDash inserts "?!?!?!" here
<Fireant> "Now we will have fun!"
<Nuclear> Huh?
<killerrabbit> this is PG? :O
<Nuclear> OH boy charades
*Fireant take out monopoly and set the board to the game.
<Nuclear> I like this game
<Lunasta> Lawdee, this chat is usually more after dark than EAD at this time
<killerrabbit> monopoly? lame
<Gilda> I'm the boot!
<Lunasta> Especially when Fireant joins in
<Lawdee> ;p;
<killerrabbit> picka good board game at least!
<Lawdee> lol
*^RainbowDash wants the car!
<Ludovician> Nobody's talked in EAD for 15 mins
<Fireant> killerrabbit, how about Agricola?
<Fireant> Or Twilight Struggle?
<Lawdee> because it's like night in the Amrica's?
<killerrabbit> there we go, now that's a good one :D
<^RainbowDash> I want the car! The car is fast!
<Nuclear> I want the nuke!
<Nuclear> Gimme
<Ludovician> what are we playing?
<Fireant> Agricola!
<Nuclear> ?
<killerrabbit> I haven't played twilight struggle, wish I had
<Lawdee> We're playing agricola?
<Nuclear> Explain
*^RainbowDash drops Nuclear in the lake
<Fireant> Its an awesome game.
<Ludovician> rules?
<killerrabbit> so I've heard
<Fireant> I hog the clay to upgrade my house fast.
<Nuclear> -_-
<killerrabbit> its ok, I get all the wood so you can't build fences :P
<johnsey|workmode> end clopmode, initiate workmode
<Dermathil> ohai guys
<Fireant> Fences?
<Nuclear> lol
<Fireant> Who uses fences!
<^RainbowDash> Settler of Coltan, lol.
<Sathi> ohai
<Fireant> Blargh.
<killerrabbit> fences for animals of course!
<Lawdee> Massive steel walls
<Fireant> hates Settlers of Lucktan.
<GGgala_> hai
<Lawdee> Not balls
<Lawdee> walls
<killerrabbit> ^^
<killerrabbit> settlers is a bad game -.-
<Nuclear> 777
<Nuclear> 666
<killerrabbit> better than monopoly, granter, but bad -.-
<killerrabbit> granted*
<Lunasta> Monopoly is just for raging
<Lawdee> ffffuuuuuuu
<Lunasta> And Sorry is for trolling
<Nuclear> Monopoly LOL
<killerrabbit> monopoly is, roll the dice, go afk for a minute while everypony else does their turn -.-
<^RainbowDash> ^
<killerrabbit> since the game is 95% luck
<Nuclear> True
<Nuclear> So true
<Lawdee> I never liked monopoly
<Nuclear> Get out of jail free.......
<killerrabbit> all the "classic" board games are luck based, it kind of sad really :/
<killerrabbit> it is*
<Lunasta> Not all of them, chess is probability and stats
<^RainbowDash> ^
<Lunasta> strats*
<Shaico> Beee right back
<Sathi> hope to get streaming fixed today, a little more patience pls
<killerrabbit> well, I meant games from the 1900s
<Gilda> You could get lucky and get matched against someone useless.
<^RainbowDash> Chess is probably one of the few games not reliant on luck
<killerrabbit> chess, go, etc. don't count
<Nuclear> I'm going to have to move my house by the lake if I keep getting dropped in.....
<^RainbowDash> If a game involves cards or dice, it's gonna be part luck
<Lawdee> When did this get transformed into a civilised conversation about old-timey games
<Lawdee> I'm confused
<Nuclear> Randomize
<Gilda> Well, ponies, I gotta fly. Smell yah later.
<killerrabbit> ^RainbowDash: well yeah, but a lot of games take this randomized factor and make it strategic
<Nuclear> Bye gilda!
<killerrabbit> e.g. dominion
<Ludovician> My brother made up a card game once where when you run out of cards you make up a rule and draw 5 more
<DooDawDay> Where is seth's status that everyone is talking about?
<Jazza> Something about Trixie
<^RainbowDash> Where, not what
<Lawdee> whoops I ran out of cards
<Lawdee> hmmm
<Lawdee> When you run out of cards you win
<Lawdee> YAY
<^RainbowDash> Hax...
<Nuclear> _
<Nuclear> ponie
<^RainbowDash> So. Much. Damn. Rain.
<Nuclear> CHEESUS
<Nuclear> Thunderf00t
<^RainbowDash> I can hear it from the center of my house, it's too much
<Lawdee> Christian cheese shop: Cheeses Christ
<Sketchy_Sounds> o_o
<^RainbowDash> ...though it's kinda soothing inside actually,
<Nuclear> Heh heh
<Lawdee> Oh Greg Benson, you're awesome
<Sketchy_Sounds> Must say
<^RainbowDash> Must resist... Falling asleel...
<Sketchy_Sounds> I rather like that Opera has a built-in IRC client
<Nuclear> Orly
<killerrabbit> did not know that
<Sketchy_Sounds> I shoulda utilised it sooner lol
<^RainbowDash> I really need coffee
<Nuclear> Me neither
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yah
<Nuclear> And I have Opera installed
<Nuclear> Along with 4 other browsers....
<Sketchy_Sounds> If you type in an irc server in the address bar preceded by irc:// it automatically starts the IRC client.
<Lunasta> Just snort some sugar, that keeps you awake :P
*killerrabbit installs opera to check it out
<^RainbowDash> What'd I say about snorting stuff?
<Nuclear> ?
<Nuclear> Cocaine
<Nuclear> Nah
<^RainbowDash> A nosebleed WOULD keep me awake
<Sketchy_Sounds> I only recently started using opera as my main browser. I'd been using Firefox til recently but it's just gotten so stupidly bloated.
<lolwut> woah
<lolwut> it does have an irc client!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Extensions notwithstanding, Firefox should NOT need 300K to sit there doing nothing.
<^RainbowDash> But I prefer not to resort to that
<GGgala_> sounds great!
<lolwut> I'll have to keep this in mind...
<Nuclear> Firefox
<Nuclear> Is slow as hell...
<Nuclear> And is a resource hogger.
<Balloons> Don't fall asleep. The pink elephants are on Parade 6_9
<killerrabbit> but firefox has the awesome plugins :d
<mook> you can try kmeleon as an alternative to ff
<Sketchy_Sounds> And then I installed Opera and it instead uses only 80K to sit there doing nothing.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Nowadays there's nothing Firefox can do that Opera can't, I've found.
<Nuclear> Well i do like chatzilla
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or at least nothing I was using Firefox for that Opera doesn't do.
<killerrabbit> Sketchy_Sounds: is that so?
<Nuclear> So maybe ill stick with it for a year more
<GGgala_> (i might have to ask you for tips on that later--i could never get sound working)
<Sketchy_Sounds> The only extras I had in Firefox were script and adblocking and the web dev toolbar, maybe one or two other things.
<^RainbowDash> Argh.
<^RainbowDash> So tired
<Fixing_headsets_on_Lunasta> Piece a crap thing...
<Nuclear> Go
<killerrabbit> I use those things all the time, so I can't not have them -.-
<Nuclear> Opera
<killerrabbit> double negative ftw?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Opera comes with a comprehensive web dev console out of the box, ad blocking out of the box, and getting AdBlock Plus and a script blocker is a matter of a few clicks.
<Nuclear> AWWWWWW
<Nuclear> Rainbowdash is gone....
<killerrabbit> does it have a bugzilla replacement?
<Nuclear> Fuuuuuuuu
<Sketchy_Sounds> What does BugZilla do? The answer is probably yes.
<Nuclear> Ah forget it.....
<Jazza> Safari too
<killerrabbit> it is basically a... debugging tool for html/javascript
<Sketchy_Sounds> Considering that Mozilla have essentially been ripping off a good number of Opera's things lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh, yes it does then.
<killerrabbit> helps determine which scripts are running slowly, not working properly, etc.
<Sketchy_Sounds> It has Dragonfly built in.
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's a VERY good html, JS, CSS and so forth debugger.
<Sketchy_Sounds> And it even has a jQuery console and other shiny stuff.
<Ludovician> im gonna get some sleep, ponies. Stayed up till 2am last 2 nights and gotta get some work done tomorrow lol
*Ludovician throws Derpybot some muffins.
<killerrabbit> eh, but it isn't open source... meh
<Sathi> that's exactly my issue aswell...
<Sathi> but i'll get back to you on it once I have it sorted out
<Sketchy_Sounds> That doesn't really matter unless you're an active developer yourself.
<killerrabbit> but I am a developer -.-
<Sketchy_Sounds> A program developer or a web developer?
<killerrabbit> program
<Dermathil> what happened to the stream yesterday?
<Dermathil> Something went wrong after I left?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well then I suppose it may matter a little to you.
<killerrabbit> not that I've actually looked FF source code or anything
<killerrabbit> I'm just a fan of the OS movement :)
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh wait a minute
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://dev.opera.com/ My goodness what could this be
<killerrabbit> just an api
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh so it is lol
*Sketchy_Sounds shrugs
<Sketchy_Sounds> Even if it's not open source as such, it's still free
<Fireant> Oh I am Back.
<Fireant> Some good link in EAD xD
<killerrabbit> o my
<Lawdee> What happened over here
<Fixing_headsets_on_Lunasta> $10 dollars and I only got 5+ months of work out of it...
<Fixing_headsets_on_Lunasta> I could have done better if I had gotten one from a dollar store
<Fixing_headsets_on_Lunasta> piece a crap
<Sketchy_Sounds> You get what you pay for
<Fixing_headsets_on_Lunasta> I know.
<killerrabbit> I have a pretty good pair of headphones
<killerrabbit> but they developed a buzzing on the mic over time :(
<Sketchy_Sounds> I have a Logitech USB headset that cost me about £20 i think and I've had it probably close to 2 years now.
<Fixing_headsets_on_Lunasta> But still, I've had better dollar store headsets
<mook> !lullaby
*DerpyBot carries mook off to bed
*DerpyBot tucks mook in and hums a lullaby
<Sketchy_Sounds> o.o
<Sketchy_Sounds> Didn't know Derpy was programmed to do that XD
<Rodman> Sup guys?
<killerrabbit> eeyup
*Fixing_headsets_on_Lunasta mumbles to himself about the crappy wires "I've seen dollar store wires thicker and better protected with real electrical tape"
<Fixing_headsets_on_Lunasta> Heyo Flatterscheu
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.xkcd.com/ Latest comic. So very very true. XD
<Flatterscheu> Heyo.
*johnsey|workmode pokes Flatterscheu
<Flatterscheu> Huh?
<Flatterscheu> Yes, what is it Johnsey?
*johnsey|workmode grins mischievously
<johnsey|workmode> nothing! just doing the pony pokey
<Flatterscheu> Ahaa.
<killerrabbit> well, it is a comparison of a 10 char password compared to a 24 char password -.-
<Flatterscheu> Hehe.
<Flatterscheu> My password is the best password.
<Flatterscheu> Literally.
<Sketchy_Sounds> True, but the point he's making is, passwords are difficult to remember for humans and easy to crack for computers.
<johnsey|workmode> it's "best password"?
<Flatterscheu> Hehe.
<Flatterscheu> Try it.
<Flatterscheu> Also, where the heck are Applejacks and Appleblooms parents?
<Nuclear> Applejack
<Flatterscheu> They aren't there when Applejack leaves the farm, when Applebloom isn't even born.
<Nuclear> Parents you mean the rich ones?
<Flatterscheu> Huh?
<Flatterscheu> What.
<Nuclear> I saw CMC ep last night
<DesertRose> the Oranges are applejacks aunt/uncle
<Nuclear> Oh
<Flatterscheu> Yeah.
<Flatterscheu> The parents are never shown.
<Flatterscheu> Even before Applebloom is born.
<killerrabbit> to be fair, only 2 ponies have their parents shown
<Flatterscheu> Twilight and um...
<killerrabbit> pinkie
<DesertRose> berrypunch and her daughter
<Flatterscheu> Pinkie.
<Nuclear> Maybe season 2 will reveal to us them...
<DesertRose> and pinkie
<killerrabbit> I meant in the mane 6 :P
<Flatterscheu> That is fanon DesertRose.
<DesertRose> :(
<Nuclear> Hi Ossalaa
<Ossalaa> haii
<Flatterscheu> It just strikes me as odd that Appleblooms parents are gone before she is born, then go back to the farm, give birth to her, and then leave again!
<DesertRose> dont even know the names of any of them
<killerrabbit> surprise! apple bloom is adopted!
<DesertRose> :O
<DesertRose> and her special talend has naught to do with apples
<Lunasta> I dun derp'd, I accidentally jabbed the jack into my reset button XD
<DesertRose> herpaderp
<Flatterscheu> Appleblooms talent is architecture.
<Flatterscheu> I called it.
<Flatterscheu> But I don't think she is adopted.
<Flatterscheu> Why would Granny Smith, Applejack or Big Macintosh adopt anything?
<killerrabbit> nope, adopted
<killerrabbit> not apples, therefore, adopted
<Flatterscheu> Maybe it is a Appleflower?
<Flatterscheu> Eh.
<Flatterscheu> I think that Applebloom is Applejacks secret daughter myself.
<Flatterscheu> Just as likely.
<Lunasta> Maybe Big Mac's illegitimate child?
<Flatterscheu> Heheheh ~
<Flatterscheu> That could be true too.
<Flatterscheu> OR BOTH.
<DesertRose> sooo....incest?
<Flatterscheu> Ehhhh
<Flatterscheu> Maybe.
<Flatterscheu> >Rednecks
<DesertRose> must be
<DesertRose> its plausible
<Flatterscheu> Yup.
<DesertRose> but never in a kiddies show
<Flatterscheu> It will never be shown.
<Flatterscheu> Yes.
<Flatterscheu> But wouldn't the element of HONESTY have some hard trouble to hide her secret daughter?
<killerrabbit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zfGhwtbBw#&t=2m50s
<Flatterscheu> :/
<DesertRose> never in any television show....enless you want to insult every sotherner in america
<Nuclear> INCEST? THIS IS MADNESS!
<killerrabbit> link related to this discussion
<DesertRose> LOL
<Flatterscheu> xD
<Lunasta> Ha
<killerrabbit> braeburn x applejack = applebloom?
<Dermathil> Ohai Rodman
<Flatterscheu> Maybe.
<Dermathil> >mfw he left.
<Dermathil> darnit.
<Lunasta> oooh
<Lunasta> episode 9 is up
<Lawdee> oh god
<Dermathil> SO, how is everybrony today?
<Sketchy_Sounds> It'd explain Applejack's seeming animosity towards him, aside from the other more obvious stuff
<Lawdee> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kDVj5elUx0&feature=related check the top comments
<killerrabbit> yeah, still not as good as ep 5/6 though
<Lawdee> and their thumbs
<killerrabbit> 5/6 of the abridged series was so good
<Shaico> Man past sins is REALLY good so far.
*Sketchy_Sounds glomps Octavia

<Lawdee> daammit my keyboard fails to cooperate
*Octavia hugs Shaico, "Hello, dear"
<killerrabbit> Nuclear: I think it is worth watching each episode once, even though the first one kind of sucks imo
<Nuclear> Okay ill check it out

<Flatterscheu> Holy fuck.
<Flatterscheu> 192 tangerines :O

<Ziltoid> all at once
<Lawdee> If I ever will be playing amnesia again It'll be as a let's play
<Lawdee> just so I could talk
<Lawdee> and not be exploding on the inside
<Dermathil> cause I'm thinking of muting stream and watching some youtube vids atm

<FallSilently> Oh great, he's gonna want my new nick now, isn't he.
<MrPoniator> And so, a thread either derails to Steven Magnet, or it's started by him
<MrPoniator> Eh, dunno if he comes to this chat
<Dman> Pegacorn - /b/, and 4chan, is generally a funny place. mostly I feel sorry for the people who spend their lives on it, but most of the time reading through it is funny. occasionally thought there's some deep shit there too.
<CrystalWalrein> Is that another command? xD
<MrPoniator> haven't seen him in a while either, though, he may be in /oat/ or I'm just missing something

*AtomicBrony is on irssi
<MrPoniator> Yeah, guess it's the "normal" layout

<Pegacorn> You DO remember what i told yesterday,right Dman?
<Dman> wtf i have never heard this used in britaion
<Pegacorn> *told you
<RobotPinkie> Insane, I'm pretty sure you can get a fairly good idea of at a certain point. :P
<Dman> Pegacorn - yes
<prince-dari> 1. In a state of mind that prevents normal perception, behavior, or social interaction; seriously mentally ill.
<prince-dari> 2. (of an action or quality) Characterized or caused by madness.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> 1. (of a person) Of sound mind; not mad or mentally ill: "hard work kept me sane".
<prince-dari> 2. (of an undertaking or manner) Reasonable; sensible.

<Steven_Magnet> 6 Prince-Dari's dictionary is 47% awesome. (1400)
<Pegacorn> And it still applies today Dman.
<RobotPinkie> But normal is a kind of weird mess of averages that applies to no one.
<Dman> >define madness / mentally ill / of sound mind / sane / reasonable/sensible
<Dman> Do it

*DerpyBot glomps AtomicBrony

Seriously, especially britain, but most of the world, they have these 'socially acceptable' standards nowadays.
<Dman> People - Y U NO Live?
<MrPoniator> You do know that copy-pasting the channel over and over doesn't win you anything if no one is interested, right?
<Dman> Yesa Pegacorn
<Wheatley_Core> Yeah..
<Wheatley_Core> It keeps resetting anyway.
*Hawkie forgot which one she's at, lol
<Dman> dat aisle 2
<Pegacorn> Dat cut
<Hawkie> 07not that it matters much because I'm a fleeb
<prince-dari> If you wanna climb the building, from experience people call the police and you get arrested for trespass.
<RobotPinkie> Well I think the point is more if you run naked into an old folks' home armed with a herring.
<Dman> Prince-dari depends where :P
<Lakorv> gah
<RobotPinkie> That's sort of unambiguously not sane.
<Lakorv> there must be a bug somewhere
<Lakorv> I can't get your data.
<Dman> But mostly yea dari, mostly. not if it's somewhere like your school roof after school (at least our teachers dun mind ^_^) and spain - nobody giveatoss : D

<Wheatley_Core> Hi.
<Xiagu> Hi Fireant!
<Dman> (probably 15 secs - I was typing 'OF ULTIMATE DESTINY!' )
<Lakorv> actually
<^PinkiePie> Alright, time to be killed by little girls in silly dresses!
<Wheatley_Core> I wonder how to make the topic to stay on a chat or make it colored
<Lakorv> I've not implemented a way of 'owning' her like those scripts do
<MrPoniator> Hey my favorite fiery ant!
<Dman> oh u mean this, or showdown, dari?
<Lakorv> this just uses the defined owner.
<Rodman> DAT BEEPING
<Lakorv> Minnet: who's your owner?
<MrPoniator> Google?
<Minnet> You are my bloody owner, silly.
<Hawkie> 07Ah XD
<prince-dari> This
<Dman> This is Megas XLR
<prince-dari> Which is?
<Wheatley_Core> Ok fireant, I wonder how to make the topic to stay on a chat or make it colored
<Dman> "Megas XLR is an American animated television series that aired on the Toonami block on Cartoon Network and is produced by Cartoon Network Studios. It was created by Jody Schaeffer and George Krstic. Its opening song is "Megas XLR Theme (Chicks Dig Giant Robots)" by Ragtime Revolutionaries."
<prince-dari> What's it about?

<johnsey|workmode> there's a new command called !moon, but I don't recommend using it.
<AtomicBrony> So does /msg botname help
<AtomicBrony> :P
<Pegacorn> He said my story was cool and called me bro.
<Dman> That's so sad, Rodman :(
<Dman> lol Pegacorn
<Lakorv> must be a bug that snuck in while I did various fixes.
<Xiagu> ...now we /have/ to use it, johnsey|workmode!
<icefire> Does it ban the user :/
<johnsey|workmode> I wouldn't if i were you
<Rodman> Yeah, very sad
<Hawkie> 07what kind of personality does she have, anyway? I kind of get the impression that she's reluctant about everything, including functioning. XD
<Rodman> The community didn't allow it to die though :D
<Dman> :)

<Dman> Suddenly GIGA DRILL BREAKA
<Dman> intredesting
<Hawkie> 07I've been called a tsundere, once upon a time. But maybe that'd fit Minnet more.
*Dman 's random megas xlr trivia: Originally entitled Lowbrow, the pilot episode was shown during Cartoon Network's 2002 Summer Contest to determine which cartoon would become a new Cartoon Cartoon; it was the most popular among viewers. After being delayed from its original debut in December 2003, Megas XLR finally debuted on Toonami on May 1, 2004
<Dman> :D
<FallSilently> Okay, pull straws.
<Rodman> DAT LASER BATTERY

<Dman> what other shows were around at this specific time?
<Lakorv> oh lords
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13xD
<Lakorv> tvtropes
<Dman> trying to remember what I saw at this time
<FallSilently> I consider that BONDING.
<Hawkie> 07Angel, I beat you to it
<Rodman> Dexter's Lab was pretty much done by then
*Dman 's Character despriptions: Harold "Coop" Cooplowski (David DeLuise): The pilot of Megas and the main protagonist, Coop is overweight and has an insatiable appetite. Due to years of playing video games, he is an excellent pilot. He's not exactly the brightest person around—his amazing heroics are just accidents, and he usually ends up destroying more than
<Jazza> !sun
<Rodman> Invader Zim though
*Dman he protects. Coop also is quite strong as depicted by his demonstrations of raw power, such as being able to punch a car window and breaking it without flinching or using a wrench to wreck a null distortion missile on Megas. The number on his jacket is 12.
<Lakorv> think it fits Hawkie better
<Dman> Invader Zim!
<Lakorv> Minnet doesn't love.
<Hawkie> 07Haha
<Xiagu> Nopony gets banished to the sun, that'd be ridiculous!
<Dman> I WOULD VOTE FOR THAT
<Lakorv> yet anyway.
*Lakorv hides
<Rodman> THE DOOM SONG!
<FallSilently> It'd be okay at night.

<Jazza> FallSilently has a point
<Rodman> FFFFFFFFFFFFFF-

<prince-dari> >anything
<prince-dari> OH dear.
<FallSilently> Octavia? You okay over there?

<Rodman> Megas is worth $2
<Dman> >find mecha > TWO. BUCKS. > Profit.
<Pegacorn> Lol
<Octavia> Rarity reference.

<drf-Droid> god I hate this class
<Rodman> So, Dari, you'd never seen this show?
<drf-Droid> at least this is the last day
<Jazza> Not cool guys. Don't abuse this new command.
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Jazza> !moon
<Paul_McColtney> That was amazing.
<drf-Droid> final exam tomorrow XD
*Dman 's Character despriptions: Jamie (Steven Jay Blum): Coop's best friend and a smart-aleck slacker. He is the tritagonist of the series, although his contributions are minimal, and are usually limited to comic relief. He frequently makes passes at Kiva and other women, often to little success. He is very cowardly and often runs at the first sign of danger.
<Rodman> Oh man
<Fireant> Wheatley, unban me :p
<Wheatley_Core> I did.
<Rodman> What you've missed
<Jazza> What is this
<Wheatley_Core> I believe I did.

<Lakorv> Minnet: set logging level to internal
<johnsey|workmode> i think derpy is d/c

*DerpyBot glomps Wheatley_Core
<Dman> oopa
<Dman> oops *
<Lakorv> better.
<Hawkie> 07Lakorv: funfact, that article also was required reading for me. Along with 'clingy jealous girl'. And a tsundere is basically a character who alternates between being irritable and lovestruck, lol
<Dman> HAHA called it :P
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
<RobotPinkie> Consequences will never be the same
*DerpyBot glomps johnsey|workmode
*DerpyBot plugs her ears with some muffins
<Rodman> Dat epic zoom
<Hawkie> 07I don't really like tvtropes much. Too many floof associations.
<Lakorv> a tsundere is a bipolar-ish-mooded person.
<Paul_McColtney> Lets not use the !moon command that much anymore
<Lakorv> </summedUp>
<Dman> ATUPID SPE
<drf-Droid> how can a bot be lovestruck?

<Hawkie> 07and drf
<RobotPinkie> trololol
<Hawkie> 07I saw that comic
<Hawkie> 07; ; kinda made me sad, but oh well
<Xiagu> Justanotherpony, if you haven't been paying attention it sends you TO THE MOON (you get kicked)
<drf-Droid> OK
<Lakorv> Hawkie: diff is a few restricted commands.
<Lakorv> like disconnecting.
*Dman 's random character trivia: Kiva Andru (Wendee Lee): Kiva is a military pilot and engineer who traveled back in time from over a thousand years in the future. Also the deuteragonist, She has a no-nonsense personality, but adopts a small sense of humor as the series progresses, and is highly skilled in both robotic and hand-to-hand combat.
<Justanotherpony> ah
*Dman Kiva is knowledgeable, tough, and fearless. Originally meant to be the pilot of Megas, she can no longer pilot it due to Coop's modifications, and finds herself stuck in the present time. Instead of driving MEGAS herself, she tries to train Coop. Kiva usually operates a holographic panel in Megas's back seat.
<Hawkie> 07Bah.
<Hawkie> 07I can't make her die in a fire
<drf-Droid> now you know why I didn't know about that thing :P

<Lakorv> this should do it.
*RobotPinkie hugs Dman
<GGgala> The Doctor: He's a social experiment!
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload db.lua
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded db.lua.
<Dman> :) robotpinkie
<Pegacorn> My god Dman,you don't have to hug everypony!
<prince-dari> I think they kind of messed up the Master.
<RobotPinkie> I have tea.
<Dman> Pegacorn oh yes. I do.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, sorry
<prince-dari> I think Tennant was awesome though.
<RobotPinkie> I.F.T.
<prince-dari> >flying in through the roof
<Dman> Robotpinkie you'r edrinking tea right now? I'm drinking tea right now!
<prince-dari> Like a baws.
*GGgala pumps fist, whispers "Yes!" aside
<Dman> I.F.T.2.
<RobotPinkie> Tea is awesome
<Dermathil> I loved that episodic arc.
<FallSilently> That'll be difficult, because they're all filthy rich and gorgeous enough to have their pick of the fillies.
<Dman> eyup
<Pegacorn> Why so Dman?
<Dman> GO DEEPER
<prince-dari> It was a pretty:

<AtomicBrony> Filthy, maybe.
<GGgala> mm beef slush puppy
<RobotPinkie> I liek beef.
<Dermathil> (the Master had the pounding in his head from as soon as the first episode with him
<Pegacorn> Dat philosophy Dman
<AtomicBrony> I'd say "rich" and "gorgeous" are a stretch.
<Dman> In relation to all mane 6 i'm most similar to pinkie - i can't stay still unless doing stuff. even on pc, my hands sorta twitch amd move 'less i'm typing :)
<Xiagu> 400 fillies!
<Dman> i don't hold many parties thou
<Fireant> Hey
<Pegacorn> gtg,seeya all later
<FallSilently> True, but it does mean you get kicked instead of me.

<Aurora> 6I went on caps lock for like 5 minutes

<Dermathil> Yeah. She liked the American remake I guess
<Aurora> 6I did some stupid stuff yesterday though
<Aurora> 6I kept running into enemies
<AtomicBrony> I"m actually rather surprised nobody's ponified Brawndo or Powerthirst yet.
<AtomicBrony> Somepony make it happen.
<Aurora> 6and I was like HMM I'M NOT RAGEQUITTING
<Dman> Ah that one. Dari as I say i sorta view some shows and stuff. I have seen about 5 episodes of that one.

<Aurora> 6and then I ran into her
<Dman> Dat referenceforeshadowcontinuity
<RobotPinkie> STREAMCEPTION AGAIN WTF?
<GGgala> a stream inside a dream
<VioletVanilla> AN STREAM
<Xiagu> AtomicBrony, I heard a ponified Powerthirst on Celestia Radio today, searched youtube, found nothing
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Dman> "too much info. her head'll explode" 'Doctordonna' people
<RobotPinkie> MEOW
<Angel_Espeon> 13I always do best on my first run
<VioletVanilla> trollface.jpg
<Dman> NYA
<Angel_Espeon> 13and any other run after that in the same day gets progressively worse .w.
<prince-dari> Shh the spoilers.
<prince-dari> :P
<Aurora> 6it's usually my 4th run
<FallSilently> So, is it "Giggle at the Ghostie" or "Giggle at the Ghostly?"
<Dman> Dari - oh snap sorry!
<Aurora> 6that I can do phenominally
<Xiagu> I think it is ``ghostly''
<Aurora> 6but half the time, I
<Aurora> 6I'll make ONE stupid mistake
<Aurora> 6and reagequit
<GGgala> >mfw Dr. Dari Song
<CogWeaver> I always thought it was Ghostie
<Fireant> Its Giggle at the Ghosties!
<Angel_Espeon> 13I do that a lot LOL
<RobotPinkie> dat Simon Pegg again
<Dman> *DUN* Double Snap, keep forgetting about the DUN if I say ur name
<Xiagu> Because the rest of the words are adjectives too
<Fireant> Or giggle at the Goatse xD
<Fireant> ^Do not google that.
<VioletVanilla> I LOVE the villain on this episode. . .
<FallSilently> Makes sense.
<Aurora> 6I've perfectly memorized the first stage
<Dman> >mfw this is exactly like detention in secondary schools uk
<Aurora> 6like, down to how many enemies and from what side of the stage, and what color
<Dman> 'yep sir sorry sir yep sir sorry sir that's right sir sorry sorry'
<Aurora> 6thats how many times I ragequit
<RobotPinkie> Well of course, who wouldn't love the villain here?
<Dman> XD
<GGgala> "SAY MY NAME, BITCH"
<AtomicBrony> It is Ghostie
<Dman> "MY NAME, MOTHAFUCKA, DO YA SAY IT?"
<AtomicBrony> And do not Google anything containing the letters "g" "o" "a" "t" "s" or "e" in the same word.
<FallSilently> How do you know, Atomic?
<GGgala> dat social commentary
<DerpyBot> *derp*
<VioletVanilla> XD
<Dman> HUGGING!
<GGgala> doctor you slut
<VioletVanilla> "Alright! I'll hug anyone!"
<AtomicBrony> Because that's what Dan Ingram called it.
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony that's most similar to RobotPinkie
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that's most similar to RobotPinkie is 7G5ild15a
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well I guess ragequitting so often has its good points in a way :P
<AtomicBrony> in his Twitter feed
<FallSilently> Well that settles it then.
<Dman> >calling doctor slut >not jack XD
<RobotPinkie> ....no...
<AtomicBrony> Don't ask me to find it though, it's waaaaayyy back there
<GGgala> @pony The pony who will hug the Doctor
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony who will hug the Doctor is 15Rari6ty
<Dman> robotpinkie I demand a reroll
*Dermathil mutters the baa ba ba ba of Dai-Guard.
<Dman> THIS is win, gggala
<AtomicBrony> Back in April or May I think
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony that's most similar to RobotPinkie
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that's most similar to RobotPinkie is 7Brae8burn
<alphaJackal> brb
<RobotPinkie> Ehhh

<Dman> That's awesome robotpinkie!
<VioletVanilla> CUPCAKES
<VioletVanilla> O^O
<Dermathil> Dman: that's the intro to Dai-Guard
<Dman> LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13I dunno whether to work on SA or UFO next
<CogWeaver> the l and i key are pretty close together though...and it was a Twitter feed...
<GGgala> hey, Jack is an officer and a gentlemen I'll have you know!
<CogWeaver> it was very likely a typo
<RobotPinkie> Haha, now that I can believe.
<Dman> he's hard working, doesn't run outta energy honest, cool guy
<Dermathil> They keep saying Baa ba ba ba
<Dman> Dermathil i know but haven't seen >_<
<Zanzibar> Random quick question (since I can't decide): Kebab or Pizza?
<Dman> You said this earlier : >
<FallSilently> Pizzabab
<Fireant> Pizza
<CogWeaver> depends on what's on 'em
<Fireant> Kebab is horror.
<Angel_Espeon> 13normally I'd go for UFO but it's been forever since I last played it, and I forgot all the tactics I had for using the UFOs efficiently
<GGgala> like the part of the intro that goes 'Bara'
<Fireant> One kebab = half glass of pure fat.
<Zanzibar> Technically you can combine them into a Kebab Pizza.
<GGgala> that's my favorite part
<Aurora> 6I never realized how much grazing is a part of this game
<Luna> Stupid autocorrect, I text my dad to ask if I should buy my friend's iPod, only iPod doesn't register in the dictionary, so I ended up asking my dad if buying an opossum in good condition was a good idea
<GGgala> total false advertising
<AtomicBrony> twltter?
<FallSilently> My genuine preference would be pizza.
<Aurora> 6until just yesterday
<Dman> much? :P
<User_3543> Calzone
<VioletVanilla> Snowing in floor 500~
<Espeon> 06o-O
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 7 minutes
<Aurora> 6PERFECT IDEA
<Dermathil> Dman, PM
<FallSilently> Now I want pizza.
<User_3543> filling being the kebab
<Aurora> 6I APPROVE
<Dman> (british thing) "something something much?" :P
<RobotPinkie> Well, I guess if I'm Braeburn I get to hang with awesome fillies.
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Dman> Ty Dermathil
<Zanzibar> I'ev had that User_3542
<AtomicBrony> Oh, and twitter.com/dannyimusic
<Zanzibar> 3542*

<Dman> @Pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Dman is 8Sapphire 12Sh11or12es
<GGgala> Dman: i hear that in american too.
<Zanzibar> It's not terribly good.
<Dman> THATS NOT RIGHT STEVEN
<Luna> I didn't realize until he texted back, "How are you going to take that to university with you?"
<Dman> GGgala ah ok then :3
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13Decided I'm not done yet
<User_3543> because it wasnt a pizza filled kebab
<prince-dari> Dem plastic sheets.
<User_3543> Kebabception?
<Zanzibar> User_3543*
<prince-dari> You know what they remind me of?
<AtomicBrony> Kebab on a kebab
<Dman> :O Dermathil MFW i've heard this somewhere
<AtomicBrony> On a pizza
<VioletVanilla> What dari?
<AtomicBrony> On a kebab
<Fireant> Kebabception.
<Dman> like, not similar, but EXACTLY THIS
<Zanzibar> You're right, it was a kebab filled pizza :P
<prince-dari> Cyber men.
<Dman> i recognise
<Aurora> 6angel
<CogWeaver> on a pizza
<Aurora> 6you need to play extra
<GGgala> like the first episode of Buffy: "were there marks on the body?" "Morbid much? I didn't ask!"
<Aurora> 6RIGHT NOW
<Fireant> Pizza in Pizza?
<Fireant> Pizzception.
<AtomicBrony> That needs to be an MLP song
<Dermathil> Dman: from SRW Z2
<AtomicBrony> In seasn 3
<Dman> Dari - FOR QUEEN AND COUN-TREEEEE
<AtomicBrony> season 3
<VioletVanilla> o:
<Dman> Dermathil - I knew it! :P
<drf-Droid> LOL @ Luna
<Fireant> Season 3?
<Dermathil> The theme is instrumentalized in the game
<CogWeaver> S3?
<RobotPinkie> No idea, they remind me of lots of UWAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA *dies of fright*
<Dman> :P
<Fireant> Silly, there will be no Season 3.
<AtomicBrony> Yes, S2 is already well into production
<Zanzibar> Anyway, thanks! Pizza was voted. Time to order food. Yum.
<drf-Droid> you should submit that to that autocorrect fails site
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13But it takes me forever to memorise those stages D:
<drf-Droid> also bbl
<CogWeaver> yeah, they'll skip right over S3 and go straight to S4
<AtomicBrony> Pfft, screw you, there's gonna be a season 3
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13I still haven't beat Suwako yet, though I've come close several times
<AtomicBrony> Just you wait and see
<Dman> uwahahaaaa? Like, What Rarity says?
<Aurora> 6FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<CogWeaver> no, they'll just skip it
<Aurora> 6I had a perfect run giong
<Aurora> 6and then I did something stupid
<Aurora> 6ONE AGAIN, MY 4TH RUN
<GGgala> the plastic sheets are like the ones they wrapped Laura Palmer in
<Dman> Hello! it's me!
<RobotPinkie> I'm slowly converting one of my friends into a brony.
<GGgala> they're inherently morbid
<AtomicBrony> Well, if there's a season 4, then there's bound to be more
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13LOL
<Dman> Robotpinkie - hi five man!
<NewDCD> 9guys what theme are you talking about
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13I say keep going anyway just to see what happens :P

<VioletVanilla> That's how it works. . .
<Aurora> 6I am

<Aurora> 6if I made it to satori like that
<VioletVanilla> No one wants to be forced to enjoy something
<Aurora> 6wh knows
<VioletVanilla> but if they see you enjoy it THAT much
<VioletVanilla> Soon or later.. . They'll want that enjoyment

<VioletVanilla> @prince-dari: Because who wants to move when they know they're in danger? :'3
<FallSilently> What episode is that sleepy-eyes Pinky from? I can't place it.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<RobotPinkie> Nothing more awesome than people who were previously uninterested asking about the show.
<Dman> Dari - annoys me they just stand there with a huge scream
<RobotPinkie> They are in the future, maybe they've had fainting goat DNA spliced in?
<GGgala> did she say 'space oil'?
<Dman> XD
<VioletVanilla> @RobotPinkie: I totally agree! c;
<Dman> SPAAACE
<Dman> Also agree, GGgala
<GGgala> buy some space oil to run your space car over to the space grocery! IN SPACE
<AtomicBrony> Now my channel order is all screwed up but oh well.
<VioletVanilla> @prince-dari: You know if you're in a horrifying situation, you'll just sit there and scream
<Dman> dat dog
<VioletVanilla> Like, if Scootaloo and Scootatwo were about to rape you over and over again
<FallSilently> Yeah, me too, EQD is aaaall the way over there on the right
<GGgala> shift-eyed dog. IT WAS HIM
<VioletVanilla> Stand there and scream.

<Justanotherpony> it can't be helped that EQafterdark is superior!
<prince-dari> He can't.
<GGgala> >never cruel
<prince-dari> He's terrible.
*CogWeaver is unaffected by the guitar bouncing off of him*
<WontBeUsed> on ps3 sure

<prince-dari> Seriously though, I see Matt Smith deliver lines and think he couldn't have managed it worse.
<Dman> Dari - now 2 trailers then moar dr who?
<Dermathil> now they need to remake this sketch with Eccleston, Tennant and Smith in it
<Justanotherpony> on afterdark i can and they encourage it
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Justanotherpony> well dashie does
<Luna> Oh, that's wonderful
<Cynder7> 6I think there's a demo in the PlayStation store..maybe I'll try it out..
<Dman> : / dat smith hate. I'm gonna accept it i've actually flinched a few times
<CogWeaver> well, according to Fire, you can swear in here too...but that might have just been him being cranky due to him not getting any alcohol in his system for over a week or so

<Dman> =]
<Dman> Never before have people been as accepting and tolerating :3
<Lawdee> According to rules
<Lawdee> You can swear
<Dman> Dari do you remember 'yesterday I died' dr who music vid I posted a few weeks ago?
<Lawdee> just not like a sailor
<prince-dari> The upside of Smith for me is that whoever the next Doctor is, it can only get better from now.
<CogWeaver> yeh
<Dman> not gonna request nao cuz it's sad, but it's also legendary tier imo :3
<Dermathil> ^^
<prince-dari> Yeah Dman.
<Dermathil> MARTHA
<Dman> Lol Dari
<Justanotherpony> Its hard to show what i cannot post here without posting it <<
<RobotPinkie> I still want Eddie Izzard as the next Doctor
<CogWeaver> but I like to keep it to a minimum when I'm moderating
<Dermathil> MARTHA JONES!
<Luna> They don't want me spending my own money to get the iPod, but if I write a 1000 word essay on why I can't use my dad's old mp3 player for university, they'll pay for it
<Dman> MARTHA IS AWESOME
<Dman> Smith can't act is an acceptable accusition
<RobotPinkie> I don't get why he hasn't been picked already, I mean Jesus
<GGgala> Marthaaaa
<Dman> BUT MARTHA IS AWESOME Companion
<prince-dari> Black Doctor or woman Doctor next plox.
<Dman> : /
<prince-dari> Something different.
<Dman> Woman?
<RobotPinkie> ...I mean.... Celestia... not Jesus.
<Justanotherpony> But oh well, apple cider sure is delicious
<GGgala> i vote Indian doctor
<CogWeaver> it keeps things in a brighter mood if the use of explicitives is kept on the down-low
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I'd like to see a female Doctor, too.
<Winter-puff> black doctor would have to be black dynamite
<prince-dari> LOL
<RobotPinkie> I mean there's no reason they couldn't have one, I mean they'll just have to explain it later.
<GGgala> Jennifer Saunders for 12th Doctor!
<SillyFilly> :3
<prince-dari> BLACK DYNAMITE FOR DOCTOR
<SillyFilly> i like Berry Punch more <3

<CogWeaver> 6_9 DERP
<prince-dari> So much epic.
<prince-dari> So little time.
<AtomicBrony> So what happens if an op does it 3 times?
<Dermathil> great line.
<CogWeaver> nothing
<Luna> I hate most of the Android mp3 players
<The_Crowing> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, The_Crowing!
<AtomicBrony> Lame.
<CogWeaver> ops can do it however many times they like
<WontBeUsed> kinda feel like going home so that i can play it again.
<CogWeaver> because sometimes we need to
<AtomicBrony> Pfft
<HyperMetalLugia> I hate all of the Apple MP3 players
<Cynder7> 6Do you have to follow the little girl and protect her throughout the whole game?
<The_Crowing> XD
<Lawdee> 3x kick = always ban?
<prince-dari> This video's top comment:
<Ali1017> get bucked out of the chat huh
<prince-dari> The thing I loved about the tenth doctor was his﻿ energy. He had just the right balance of seriousness and madness. I miss him.
<prince-dari> One of them anyway.
<HyperMetalLugia> And there are other Mp3 players out there
<Lawdee> for guests
<prince-dari> I agree.
<CogWeaver> for DerpyBot, yes, Lawdee
<Dermathil> yeah
<Lakorv> there are android mp3 players? o.O
<Lawdee> aha
<HyperMetalLugia> Everything isn't Android/Apple ya know :p
<WontBeUsed> no
<HyperMetalLugia> I guess O.o
<Dermathil> Tennant was crazy and serious enough both
<Luna> Android mp3 player applications
<Lakorv> I've not been following the techs, so..
<The_Crowing> The moon thing can get you banned?
<Lakorv> oh
<RobotPinkie> Tom Baker.
<AtomicBrony> Five-minute ban
<Lakorv> okay.
<Luna> There aren't any decent ones imo
<HyperMetalLugia> Winamp on Android plz
<Leonon> 5 minutes ON THE MOON!
<Lakorv> well it's a phone.
<CogWeaver> for all the other sentient mods though, it's Warn->Kick->Warn->Ban(24hrs)->Warn->PermaBan
<GGgala> oh the reading was me, but i want doctor who next now
<Dermathil> Smith is like on an imbalanced scale and jumps from one side to the other, tilting it heavily each time
<GGgala> he
<Dermathil> (MOAR DOCTOR)
<Luna> Winamp's app sucks Hyper
<WontBeUsed> it has a real good story to it. you should buy it its only 8.00
<HyperMetalLugia> Baw :P
<Luna> Exactly Lakorv, that's why I'd rather a separate mp3 player
<RobotPinkie> I grew up watching Tom Baker on TV, though it was reruns.
<Cynder7> 6Only? o.o
<Lakorv> so get a proper one
<Cynder7> 6How come? I thought it was fairly new..
<HyperMetalLugia> Well WHY a iPod :P
<WontBeUsed> yeah but something went wrong
<Justanotherpony> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Justanotherpony!
<Luna> Mostly because my friend's selling one for the cheap
<prince-dari> I cringe at Smith's acting. :/
<Lakorv> I would recommend the Cowon D2, but it's not produced anymore I don't think.
<GGgala> stream trouble?
<RobotPinkie> Still, Tom Baker is pretty much who I associate most with Doctor Who, he was awesome
<Justanotherpony> doesnt give a lot of time to grab on
<Lakorv> ~45 hours of playback time <3
<Leonon> it's like a modern trial by ordeal, if after 5 minutes on the moon you're not dead then you're judged as innocent
<Lawdee> nope
<Lakorv> or at least 40.
<HyperMetalLugia> I bet the average sansa is cheaper than a iPod on sale :P
<RobotPinkie> Yeah capture not centered, dari
<WontBeUsed> i bought it before prices jumped back up, infact i bought 2 one for me and one for my homie.
<Luna> Oh wow, nice
<Sakuya> Wait doesn't android already play mp3s as it is?
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice :P
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Lawdee> oh it's like the witch thing
<Sakuya> Or did I not read enough
<Cynder7> 6Meh..I doubt I'll get that or any other game any time soon..I'll be stuck with Infamous 2 and CoD4 till Christmas..
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Leonon> yeah, but with even less air
<CogWeaver> lol
<Lakorv> Sakuya: the vanilla app usually gets quite some pepper for poor user interface.
<Lakorv> or something.
<Lawdee> Derpaderpaderp if u float ur witch if u dont u die trolololo
<Luna> Yes
<WontBeUsed> even tho its only $8.00?!
<RobotPinkie> Thanks :)
<Cynder7> 6Yep
<Sakuya> Im confused lol
<RobotPinkie> This is a really good episode.
<Leonon> yeah but the other way around, if you die you're guilty if not you're innocent
<WontBeUsed> damn that sucks.
<Luna> It also erases my playlists for no reason
<Cynder7> 6I wish I had like 500$ just to spend on games.. :P
<Lawdee> ah right
<HyperMetalLugia> If Luna gets a iPod, she'll have to deal with lagtunes on a regular basis :p
<prince-dari> INB4 Rose is just another stupid ape
<HyperMetalLugia> Which is a terrible idea
<AMereLurker> ey
<Lawdee> oi

<RobotPinkie> Oh... that's not good.
<HyperMetalLugia> I fail to see the point in that
<HyperMetalLugia> Luna should just get the old Mp3 for free :P
<Sakuya> That is by far the most random essay ever
<HyperMetalLugia> Her parents should just say no in general xD

<prince-dari> If it's still lagging I'll just lower the quality.
<HyperMetalLugia> aO.o
<prince-dari> Stream's up.
<drfsupercenter> 03veered off the road and destroyed a guy's mailbox
<drfsupercenter> 03he gets pissed, comes running at me like YOU DESTROYED MY $400 MAILBOX
<ValtheJean> kittehs
<Luna> .... *snort*
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like, uh, I don't have any money with me but I can give you my insurance information
<drfsupercenter> 03he's like screw it, I'm calling the police
<Luna> What a self centered guy
<Sakuya> Lol moron
<drfsupercenter> 03he told the police he thought I was drinking, too
<drfsupercenter> 03fricking idiot
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I go to the nearest side road
<drfsupercenter> 03call AAA
<drfsupercenter> 03Get my spare tire put on
<GGgala> got it
<drfsupercenter> 03which is actually a full sized tire LOL but still
<Sakuya> He's like most of the people in my home town
<GGgala> lag again?
<drfsupercenter> 03fricking police give me a ticket for failure to report an accident, sicne I panicked and didn't realize I had to call the police
<GGgala> scheisse
<drfsupercenter> 03but he said if I pay the guy for the mailbox and then make a court date, and they confirm I took care of it, they'll void the ticket
<drfsupercenter> 03but sigh, paying $400 for someone's mailboxZ?
<drfsupercenter> 03-Z
<prince-dari> Ok.
<drfsupercenter> 03Plus I need to get my tire replaced...
<drfsupercenter> 03and the mirror, which also broke
<prince-dari> I'll lower the quality then.
<Luna> That really sucks
<prince-dari> My ISP be derpin'.
<Luna> You don't seem to have luck with vechiles
<Luna> And I can't spell today
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL I know right
<Sakuya> Well voiding a ticket is better, trust me
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<prince-dari> Ok, give me a minute.
<Sakuya> But yeah that's harsh
<drfsupercenter> 03since I don't want points on my license
<drfsupercenter> 03but seriously, stupid idiot has a $400 mailbox
<Sakuya> Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd buy him a $20 mailbox LOL
<Luna> Ahahah do it!
<Sakuya> Well
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the guy has to be happy with it
<drfsupercenter> 03as much as a $125 ticket is probably cheaper
<drfsupercenter> 03insurance rates would go up etc
<Sakuya> Was it a specialized mailbox?
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno, I didn't see it
<drfsupercenter> 03I was too busy going WOOOOOAH
<Sakuya> Well yeah but if you're replacing it
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Sakuya> I figure he would have explained it
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll have to talk to him
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03the guy was too busy being mad
<drfsupercenter> 03to care
<prince-dari> Ok, stream's up.
<drfsupercenter> 03he just wrote down my license plate number and called the police >_>
<Sakuya> Plus, 400 is not a normal mailbox
<Luna> I can't believe he cared more about his mailbox
<drfsupercenter> 03I offered to give him my insurance info
<Ziltoid> streamception
<drfsupercenter> 03well to be fair Luna
<Ziltoid> what are you streamoing?
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13LOL sorry, I shouldn't laugh
<Sakuya> In which case it could be specialized
<prince-dari> Doctor Who
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13but he shouldn't be making such a big deal over a silly mailbox
<drfsupercenter> 03what would it look like if someone's driving down the road normally and then just randomly drives off the road and destroys your mailbox
<Ziltoid> season 1?
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13and why he bought such an expensive one, I've no idea
<drfsupercenter> 03you'd be like WTF are you smoking
<GGgala> yep
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13I'm sure it does the same job as a much cheaper one
<drfsupercenter> 03but he didn't even want me to explain, he was just like pay me
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<Sakuya> Angel, landscaping probably
<Nick> ugh I can't believe it
<prince-dari> Lag better now?
<drfsupercenter> 03and well

<Aurora> 6angel I realized my problem
<Aurora> 6in SA
<RainBroDash> 10do something funnny *poke* :P
<Aurora> 6I'm so used to EoSD/PCB style gameplay, I keep forgetting you technically have unlimited bombs
<Aurora> 6since they're based on power, not count
<Aurora> 6I'm always afraid to waste a bomb
<GGgala> maybe play the 'look at my horse, my horse is amazing' song?
<Aurora> 6forgetting that I can replenish it
<RobotPinkie> Juggle onions while wearing a shoe as a hat.
<Aurora> 6thats why I keep dying I think lol
<RobotPinkie> True....
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL yeah, took me a while to adjust to that
<RainBroDash> 10the stream topic doesn't say I have no balls?
*RainBroDash 10has balls
<RobotPinkie> ...do you always juggle onions, though?
<Ray> 02._. .-.
<Angel_Espeon> 13just don't go too crazy with it, or you'll end up feeling so helpless when you're stuck with no power |D
<Aurora> 6but I still dont think I can bring myself to bomb easily in boss fights due to the power reduction
<Ziltoid> im back
<Ray> 02Unlimited bombs?
<Aurora> 6yeh
<ValtheJean> oh god
<RobotPinkie> welcome back
<prince-dari> No, you don't have balls till you sing.

*RainBroDash 10has balls, and nopony can stop me
<prince-dari> But I don't feel the need to restate that you don't have them, it's obvious.
<RobotPinkie> I think I might watch some Torchwood...
<Aurora> 6you know how in EoSD/PCB/IN you had like 4 bombs per life?
<Aurora> 6or 3
<Aurora> 6whichever
<Ray> 02yeah
<Aurora> 6in MoF and SA (and I think UFO), it's based purely on how much power you have
<RobotPinkie> inb4 this is the national anthem of Equestria in Season 2
<Ziltoid> lawl
<Aurora> 6you're given variables, 1,2,3, and 4
<Ray> 02o-o
<Aurora> 6 1 being your lowest power
<GGgala> dohohoho
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nah, UFO brought the bomb feature back
<Aurora> 6but at 2,3,and 4, you can use a bomb
<Angel_Espeon> 13and MoF has a max power of of 5
<Aurora> 6but it brings your power down one entire varible
<ValtheJean> quick guys
<Aurora> 6so if you're at max power at 4.0
<Aurora> 6use a bomb
*RainBroDash 10wants something to do
<ValtheJean> someone who wasn't from BMN posted a leverage thread
<RainBroDash> 10;P
<Aurora> 6you're down to a power of 3.0
<ValtheJean> I need the leverage images
<Ray> 02yo go down to -- ninja'd
<Aurora> 6but you can gain power ups and bring that back to 4 very quickly
<Ray> 02yeah I get it
<Aurora> 6yep

<Ziltoid> so no more video?
<ValtheJean> preferably the "niggas be posting in a leverage thread"

<RobotPinkie> lol oh it's in /oat/, I was looking in /chat/
<Aurora> 6I used to do it since her ability is nice
<Aurora> 6but it gets you too used to the cheap way
<Aurora> 6and you miss ALL the bonuses
<RainBroDash> 10do ho ho
*RainBroDash 10loves RainBroDash
<Angel_Espeon> 13Her bomb isn't that good either and still makes me feel vulnerable .w.
<RobotPinkie> RAINBROCEPTION
<GGgala> RainBroCest
<Dashite> Self love. It's a wonderful thing.
<Aurora> 6yeah
<GGgala> DOUBLE RAINBRO: The Fan Fiction
<Aurora> 6try either yukari or alice
<Aurora> 6I actually want to learn patchouli
<Aurora> 6but holy ffffff
<RobotPinkie> Self love is much better if you have a split personality, though.
<Aurora> 6that is WAY too much to understand all at once
<Aurora> 6UH UH UH, FIRE SHOT, NO WAIT EARTH SHOT
<Aurora> 6NO
<Aurora> 6WAIT

<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> it probably BELONGS in chat
<ValtheJean> but the OP put it in oat
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6I don't know how anyone can understand that
<Aurora> 6but some people do
<Aurora> 6and it makes it the easiest team to use in the game

<Glacymr> 12bree?
<Dashite> Who started it this time?
<Aurora> 6yukari has a strong shot, a wonderful bomb, and I'm finally seeing how her ability works

<GGgala> but there are also a lot of pseudo-nukes, like N2 mines

<Barry> The premise is basically Fluttershy, Applejack, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash as Pony Rangers
<RobotPinkie> Wow, things are heating up, here.
<Barry> Twilight will appear later, similar to how Tommy appeared
<SilverMane> so twilight is the white ranger

<HuffytheMagicDragon> don't be a foal she's been purple like from the start
<SilverMane> oh good... well not good, but at least they didn't fuck up any harder

<drf|laptop> 03I just use the built in speakers, or stereo headphones
<ChaoAqua> 2oops

<Pegacorn> CONGRESS CONGRESS CONGRESS.
<ChaoMagma> 4wb
<Pattyrick> thanks GL and CM
<Pegacorn> EPIC CONGRESS MANEUVER!
<RobotPinkie> GIGA KONGURESSU BREIKAAAAAAAAAA
<ValtheJean> yay Kratos!
<Pegacorn> Kratos?WHERE?
<NewDCD> 9the president, he means
<ValtheJean> >the president
<NewDCD> 9so is the quality really good now?
<ASHTRAY> some noise in audio, but video is good Nigerian
<ValtheJean> looks good to me
*ChaoMagma 4is even more bored T_T
<NewDCD> 9right
<NewDCD> 9forgot to fix audio
<NewDCD> 9how's that?
<ChaoMagma> 4any ideas on what to do?
<HyperMetalLugia> Play
<drf|laptop> 03kill someone
<ASHTRAY> needs to be louder
<Pattyrick> Omegle
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<ChaoMagma> 4and does anyone know where to get Fly in PKMN Flora Sky?
<Pattyrick> never played it
<ChaoMagma> 4i like drf's idea
<Pegacorn> Oh,ok.I thought you were talking about the Spartan Kratos.
<Pattyrick> Who, though?
<ChaoMagma> 4hmm
<Pattyrick> Any ideas on who?
<NewDCD> 9how about now?
<ChaoMagma> 4eenie meenie miney mo
<Pattyrick> Chimera
<ASHTRAY> still some noise
<ASHTRAY> also
<ValtheJean> :P
<ASHTRAY> which episodo is this?
<Pattyrick> and how?
<Skylands> 10ChaoMagma =/= Chimera
<Skylands> 10But I can see the mistake as they both use red text
<Pattyrick> exactly
<ChaoMagma> 4ohai Sky
<NewDCD> 9how about now?
<NewDCD> 9also ep 19
<Pattyrick> I'm saying KILL CHIMERA
<Skylands> 10hi
*Pattyrick grabs knife and runs around
<ChaoMagma> 4yay!
<ChaoMagma> 4a kife? seriously?
<ChaoMagma> 4that's way too simple
<ASHTRAY> arso Nigerian
<Pattyrick> How about an iPhone app that detonates a bomb in his vicinity?
<Pattyrick> iBomb
<ChaoMagma> 4uh
<NewDCD> 9yes Ivorian?
<ChaoMagma> 4that's already been done
<Pattyrick> just plant the bomb disguised as something other than a bomb, open the app, press the big red button, BAM
<ChaoMagma> 4don't you see the news? oh wait what am i saying
*ChaoMagma 4fleews
<ChaoMagma> 4*flees
<ASHTRAY> you need to send me some links for DAI GAADO
<Pattyrick> not detonated with an iPhone app, though
<Pattyrick> that's more complex :p
<Pattyrick> because instead of just having to make the bomb and push a button at a time
<ValtheJean> hehe
<Pattyrick> you have to buy the iPhone, get a cellular data contract and/or have a Wi-Fi connection, download the app, and set it up to sync with the bomb
<Pattyrick> somebody set up us the bomb
<ASHTRAY> OH U Akagi, such a mecha otaku :3c
<ChaoMagma> 4uh
<ChaoMagma> 4not TOO complex
<ChaoMagma> 4how about
<ChaoMagma> 4i kill Chimera with a knife?
<HyperMetalLugia> Or you could just use a android app which'll be a bit better
<NewDCD> 9TRA LA LA
*ChaoMagma 4flees
<HyperMetalLugia> Google is fun
<Pattyrick> do you have an Android device?
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Don
<Pattyrick> who here other than drf has an Android device?
<ChaoMagma> 4i just kill Chimera and -lawl google- i can blame it on you, Pattyrick
<nickstr> ME!
<nickstr> I have two of them!
<ASHTRAY> DAT TRALALA
<HyperMetalLugia> Don't plan to get one either
<Dermathil> iceberg
<nickstr> a tablet and a phone
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF, Luna, Nickstr, Rora
<HyperMetalLugia> Quite a few people
<Luna> ?
<Pattyrick> ok
<HyperMetalLugia> Arti I think
<Pattyrick> either one of them could get it
<Pattyrick> yup, she does
<HyperMetalLugia> Not sure
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<ValtheJean> gotta love politicians
<Luna> Oh, Android

*ChaoMagma 4must return to cafe world in 23 minutes
<nickstr> but the later of the two works with Adobe Flash 10.1
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay Flash player

<Dermathil> wuh
<Dermathil> SOMEONE ELSE CHECK
<ASHTRAY> NOTTO PANISHAA that faggot up.
<ChaoAqua> 2>v> what if not???
<HyperMetalLugia> Nightseas :O
<Dermathil> 'cause mine shows my first one being way early.
<ValtheJean> most likely is chatlag on either of our (or both) side
<HyperMetalLugia> YOUR S IS LOWER CASE
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Dermathil> nah
<Nightseas> 12lol yep
<Dermathil> just the time between our locations
<ChaoHerba> 3LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
<Dermathil> the time the info moves
<Pattyrick> I saw on Dr. Oz that it's a good idea to share your passwords with your loved ones when in a relationship
<ChaoHerba> 3you not NightSeas then
<NewDCD> 9I love the idiosyncratic episode title cards in this series
<Nightseas> 12Yes I am :p
<Pattyrick> so that you can't keep secrets
<Dermathil> yeah
<NewDCD> 9DAT WAIFU
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not necessarily
<Angel_Espeon> 13what if said couple go through something nasty
<Angel_Espeon> 13and out of revenge
<Angel_Espeon> 13one of them hacks into the other's account
<Angel_Espeon> 13and messes it up
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<RobotPinkie> I'm heading off to bed, night guys
<Pattyrick> Change them before things get nasty? xD
<Nick> Im reading the northumbria police twitter feed where I am, no riots or anything but lots of single robberies happening in Newcastle which I kinda need to go to this week :\
<Pattyrick> but still, I have to disagree myself
<ValtheJean> gnight robotpinkie
<NewDCD> 9night Pinks
<NewDCD> 9SKURAMBERU?
<Pattyrick> I'm simply forced to watch it thanks to AFN
<Dermathil> cya RP
<Nightseas> 12Anyways, the S was made small to get people to stop calling me NS XD
<Pattyrick> there isn't much else better to watch here :\
<Angel_Espeon> 13Let the internet become your TV like me
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<Pattyrick> I wouldn't share all of my passwords with my loved one, only ones for my devices
<Nightseas> 12And it’s actually been somewhat working
<Pattyrick> computer (though I don't have one on my PC), iPad, etc.
<Pattyrick> I heard about this place called Protect Free TV
<Pattyrick> it looks kinda good
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have the same password for everything, hence why I'm so reluctant to let anyone know what it is
<Angel_Espeon> 13because then they'd have instant access to everything on the internet that belongs to me
<Nightseas> 12Is it floof?
<Pattyrick> I have some passwords for certain things, different ones for others
*Nightseas runs

<FreezeFrame> work was crazy
<drf|laptop> 03hmm
<drf|laptop> 03Quanyails, could you put something like this image has with the arrows pointing out melting/freezing, etc? http://www.mikeblaber.org/oldwine/chm1045/notes/Forces/Phase/h2ophase.gif
<NewDCD> 9well lookie there
<NewDCD> 9GLORIOUS QUALITY
<ChaoMagma> 4LAWL
<ValtheJean> lol, DCD takes pride in his streaming :P
<NewDCD> 9looks MUCH better now, doesn't it?
<NewDCD> 9of course I do
<NewDCD> 9I'm OCD for this sort of things
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, DRF: the font I used last time for your multi-image notes is too big for the axes.
<NewDCD> 9NEW OCD
<NewDCD> 9that said
<Quanyails> 7Could I use the smaller font?
<Pegacorn> GLOOOOOOOOOOOOORIOUS STREAMING!
<drf|laptop> 03sure
<Quanyails> 7I mean, it still fits.
<NewDCD> 9this truly is the optimal quality, I believe.
<Pegacorn> Dat explosion
<Quanyails> 7It just looks big. O_o
<drf|laptop> 03that small font is fine
<NewDCD> 9the only thing is
<NewDCD> 9would you guys prefer smaller subs?
<NewDCD> 9subs of smaller font?
<NewDCD> 9white instead of yellow?
<NewDCD> 9ect.
<ValtheJean> meh, dubs never bother me
<ValtheJean> so long as I can see what's going on I'm content :P
<Pegacorn> dat static
<Quanyails> 7You want those phase change words in there, too?
<Pegacorn> .....NewDCD,will you accept my Steam friend reqeust or not?
<Pegacorn> *request
<NewDCD> 9sorry
<NewDCD> 9OMW
<Pegacorn> OMW?
<Dermathil> On My Way
<Pegacorn> ok
<drf|laptop> 03Yes
<Quanyails> 7Can I abbreviate?
<Quanyails> 7Because writing 'pressure' and 'temperature' takes up half of the width.
<Quanyails> 7Unless I squeeze the spacing.
<NewDCD> 9there we go
<Dermathil> offline
<Pegacorn> YAY
<Quanyails> 7And the actual graph is different in both of your links.
<FreezeFrame> Best comment ever: "This show is to traditional notions of masculinity what penicillin was to syphilis. "
<Quanyails> 7Specifically, the solid-to-liquid line is at a different angle.
<mib_zfd3bu> what, my little pony?
<Pegacorn> Syphillis?
<ValtheJean> as in...the disease
<Pegacorn> oH NVM
<ValtheJean> what Henry VIII died of :P
<drf|laptop> 03sure
<FreezeFrame> Yes, anon
<drf|laptop> 03just do temp. and however you can think of to abbreviate pressure
<drf|laptop> 03though for the pressure side
<drf|laptop> 03you can do it vertically if you know how to.
<mib_zfd3bu> best comment ever: 'We get off on your tears'; developer of 'Demons Souls', on the difficulty of the game
<FreezeFrame> And yeah, syphillis is kinda rare nowadays (though I still think that's what caused Charlie Sheen, since tertiary syphillis essentially eats your brain)
<Quanyails> 7I know.
<FreezeFrame> anon: Sounds a bit like something the Ninja Gaiden (NES) developers would say.
<mib_zfd3bu> guess who i am! i bet you can't
<ValtheJean> Henry VIII?
<mib_zfd3bu> dammit val...
<mib_zfd3bu> i mean, what? no, how rediculous
<ValtheJean> HE'S A ZOMBIE GOAST
<Pegacorn> Ryu Hayabusa?
<Quanyails> 7So the direction of that slant...
<Quanyails> 7Should it be left or right?
<ValtheJean> SHOOT THE ZOMBIE GOASTS
<ValtheJean> BUT BE SAD FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY CANNOT LIVE HER
<mib_zfd3bu> i am not Goatees
<mib_zfd3bu> how do you shot web?
<FreezeFrame> No, just giggle at the ghosties
<ValtheJean> also am I the only one who sees the stream as offline?
<mib_zfd3bu> nope, it's off
<ValtheJean> ah, kk
<ValtheJean> so we doing this guessing 20 questions style or just random guess style?
<mib_zfd3bu> whatever you want, dearie
<Pegacorn> ?
<ValtheJean> hmmmmm
<mib_zfd3bu> i already dropped a major clue
*ValtheJean is torn between the spiderman reference and the dearie comment
<mib_zfd3bu> but you probably werent here for when the reference was created
<FreezeFrame> dearie is a very English thing to say
<mib_zfd3bu> ...sure, why not
<Pegacorn> WE NEED TO PROTECT THE BRIEFCASE!
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03to the left, preferrably
<drf|laptop> 03that second image is the phase diagram of water
<ValtheJean> are you, perchance a particular mod?
<drf|laptop> 03ultimately no two mixtures are the same XD
<mib_zfd3bu> nope
<Pegacorn> Ahem.Gentlemen?
<ValtheJean> truly? innnnnnteresting....
<mib_zfd3bu> Mentlegen?
*Pegacorn has a dead Spy on his shoulder.
<ValtheJean> are you a regular to the weekday streams, or just the main BMN events?
<mib_zfd3bu> you uh... have something on your, umm, shoulder, just there
<mib_zfd3bu> i'm here almost daily
<ValtheJean> were you on here earlier today?
<Pegacorn> I know i have a dead Spy on my shoulder.I killed him when you weren't looking.
<Quanyails> 7So \?
<drf|laptop> 03right
<drf|laptop> 03just barely though
<drf|laptop> 03it's vertical with a slight slant
<mib_zfd3bu> probably val
*ValtheJean would like it if he wasn't the only one guessing :P
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<ValtheJean> probably? as in you don't know?
<mib_zfd3bu> i'm special
*Pegacorn drops the dead Spy on a table
*mib_zfd3bu flutters his wings in discomfort
<ChaoMagma> 4well, bye!
<ValtheJean> damn it pegacorn quit rping and help me guess
<Quanyails> 7http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/4969/temporaryfile2.png <-- I squeezed it into this. XD
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Chao.
<ChaoMagma> 4hi Quany
<ChaoMagma> 4bye Quany
<ChaoMagma> 4bye drf
<Quanyails> 7Okay. o3o
<Pegacorn> I think mib_zfd3bu is Dman.
<drf|laptop> 03holy crap I can't view that at all
<ValtheJean> okay- last question before I give up in frustration:
<drf|laptop> 03let me try it on my calculator
<drf|laptop> 03since for some reason
<ValtheJean> damn
<drf|laptop> 03just zooming in on my computer doesn't work
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<mib_zfd3bu> no pegacorn
<ValtheJean> was gona ask if he understood the story of Dai-Guard :P
<Quanyails> 7Open in MS Paint and magnify?
<ValtheJean> but that answers that question
<mib_zfd3bu> nope nope nope
<ValtheJean> welp, I'm just going to randomly guess
<ValtheJean> Bjorn?
<mib_zfd3bu> eww
<ValtheJean> >random
<drf|laptop> 03nah
<ValtheJean> I give up
<drf|laptop> 03I'll just put it on my calculator
<Pegacorn> ANWSER VALTHEJEAN'S GUESS!
<ValtheJean> he did
<ValtheJean> "eww"
<mib_zfd3bu> IT IS I, THE MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE!
<ValtheJean> now wait just a damn minute
<Pegacorn> Ohai SilverMane.
<ValtheJean> Silvermane WAS here earlier
<mib_zfd3bu> and I said Maybe
<ValtheJean> and I eliminated you as a suspect because I was talking to you earlier
<mib_zfd3bu> and then said I'm special
<mib_zfd3bu> because i am too tired to say yes
<ValtheJean> okay, well that eliminates the point of answering questions if you give false info :P
<mib_zfd3bu> wasn't false, as simply awkward
<mib_zfd3bu> now, do i want McDonalds or Taco Bell
<Barry> Hallo
<mib_zfd3bu> hello
<Pegacorn> Now that the question of who mib_zfd3bu really is has been anwsered,i must find out who this Spy is.
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<FreezeFrame> mmm... quesadilla time.
<mib_zfd3bu> dead, the spy is
<drf|laptop> 03the "gas" looks like "gac"
<drf|laptop> 03same with subl, looks like cubl XD
<Pegacorn> .....Dat yoda joke.
<drf|laptop> 03otherwise that's good
<Pegacorn> But really,i must find out who he is.
<Quanyails> 7I know, the ses look like cs.
<Pegacorn> He,she,it,whatever.
<drf|laptop> 03can you fix that lik eyou did for the other images? :/
<Quanyails> 7Larger? Sure.
<drf|laptop> 03OK
*Pegacorn ponders on the question for a bit.
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03one more thing
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/phaseeqia/mptbpt.gif
<Quanyails> 7http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/4969/temporaryfile2.png
<drf|laptop> 03see how it has that line
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03I suppose I can just do that myself.
<Quanyails> 7Include it?
<drf|laptop> 03basically yes
<Quanyails> 7If you can fit it. XD
<Quanyails> 7Or I could take care of it.
<drf|laptop> 03I'll try
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03if you want to
<drf|laptop> 03I don't mean to sound demanding :/
<Pegacorn> Help me find out guys!
<Quanyails> 7Well, you're not. :)
<drf|laptop> 03like if you can just put little points where the horizontal line intersects for melting and boiling upoints
<drf|laptop> 03-u
<drf|laptop> 03and maybe put a "MP" and "BP" near them?
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Pegacorn> GODDAMNIT!
<mib_zfd3bu> hmmm. nah
<NewDCD> 9we're live with another quality test
<NewDCD> 9if you want to check it out
<Pegacorn> Ohai Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> ohai BronyState
<ValtheJean> howdy silverscreen
<mib_zfd3bu> ohai mark
*Silverscreen 11is procrastinating.
<Silverscreen> 11what dis?
<Quanyails> 7http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/4969/temporaryfile2.png <-- It's rather cramped.
<Silverscreen> 11Mr Freeze
<mib_zfd3bu> Teen Titans? Teen Justice?
<mib_zfd3bu> Mr Freeze? lame
<GGgala> Young Justice!
<drf|laptop> 03looks fine from what I can see of it on my PC, let me try on the calculator.
<ValtheJean> awwww
<mib_zfd3bu> ugh
<ValtheJean> Teen Titans is better :P
<Silverscreen> 11...
<GGgala> what have i walked into
<NewDCD> 9just testing for quality with different video sources
<Silverscreen> 11It's sad that I liked the old costume design better.
<Pegacorn> ....
<Silverscreen> 11Hell, even the voice is worse.
<GGgala> Silverscreen, the one with scaley green panties?
<mib_zfd3bu> Mr. Freeze's voice is epic, shame everyone elses sucks
<Pegacorn> BATMAN FTW
<Silverscreen> 11http://whosright.com/uploads/aazwwi_MrFreeze.jpeg
<NewDCD> 9doing testing, btw
<Silverscreen> 11Best Mr. Freeze Costume right there.
<mib_zfd3bu> now, do i want tacos, or a double quarter pounder with cheese
<ValtheJean> @Silverscreen haha...as terrible as that movie was...I love it
<Silverscreen> 11Worst Mr. Freeze actor.
<mib_zfd3bu> lawl epic freeze is epic
<drf|laptop> 03transferring
<GGgala> oh, the endless ice puns
<Pegacorn> Oh god.Arnold is awesome,but this role was TERRIBLE!
<mib_zfd3bu> if only it was epic freeze *trollestia*
<NewDCD> 9I'm going to PUSH MY STREAM FURTHER
<mib_zfd3bu> WE NEED TO GO STREAMER
<GGgala> I think you mean DEEPER
<drf|laptop> 03also I want to see what the calculator does with actual greyscale images. Do you have any of your sprite stuff in a similar size?
<Silverscreen> 11You all need to chill with all the hate.
<Pegacorn> WE MUST PUSH LITTLE STREAM!
<drf|laptop> 03or padded to that size?
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta eat
<NewDCD> 9MAXIMUM QUALITY OVERDRIVE
<NewDCD> 9HASSHIN!
<mib_zfd3bu> Silverscreen, who is hating?
<Silverscreen> 11Mib_zfd3bu: It was a pun.
<mib_zfd3bu> oh i get it
<GGgala> i think he was punning, mib_zfd3bu
<mib_zfd3bu> i'm slow today
<drf|laptop> 03and yeah, that image works
<mib_zfd3bu> mib_zfd3bu needs food, badly
<GGgala> captain cold?
<drf|laptop> 03cramped but I can see everything XD
<NewDCD> 9how does it look and sound?
<GGgala> no, wait, that's the flash's guy
<Dermathil> alright, cyall guys.
<NewDCD> 9total quality ranking: 924 Kbps
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Dermathil> Going to see Captain America.
<Quanyails> 7And let's see, grayscale..
<Silverscreen> 11what the hell is with all the snow enemies?
<GGgala> cya Dermathil
<Silverscreen> 11wait...is that Aquaman?
<ValtheJean> later dermathil
<Dermathil> cya guys.
<GGgala> so that's... Killer Frost?
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03leave it in color
<drf|laptop> 03the program I have can convert it xD
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<NewDCD> 9so really, how does it look? Does it lag? How about the audio?
<drf|laptop> 03it has 3 options, full greyscale, two-bit greyscale, and then pure black and white, which is what I'm using
<Silverscreen> 11No lgag
<Silverscreen> 11lag*
<GGgala> looks golden
<Silverscreen> 11Really good quality
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, small sprites.
<Silverscreen> 11Audio/video is synched.
<NewDCD> 9I would stream at this quality all the time
<NewDCD> 9but many people don't meet the requirements
<Quanyails> 7http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/162/a/1/Mamepato_Sprite_by_Quanyails.png <-- Yeah, use that. :P
<drf|laptop> 03but as far as I know, the calculator only supports black and white so I want to try it out XD
<GGgala> lawl, super friends
<Silverscreen> 11requirements?
<drf|laptop> 03alright, let's ese
<drf|laptop> 03*see
<NewDCD> 9 1 Mbps of download speed
<Silverscreen> 11ah
<NewDCD> 9to enjoy this stream
<Silverscreen> 11http://wallpapergravity.com/wallpapers1/30/30482.jpg
<NewDCD> 9the other one is .5 Mbps
<Silverscreen> 11^ Best Freeze cartoon design.
<GGgala> yesss silverscreen
<drf|laptop> 03http://i.imgur.com/JcEpZ.png
<drf|laptop> 03Let's test
<ValtheJean> gah
<ValtheJean> boss walked in
<ValtheJean> wat i miss?
<ValtheJean> Aquaman?
<ValtheJean> KILL IT
<ValtheJean> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03shoot
<drf|laptop> 03"Incorrect image size"
<drf|laptop> 03can you pad it to the right size?
<Silverscreen> 11BUT THE WHAAAAALES!
<ValtheJean> FUCK DER WHALES
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Silverscreen> 11...why does the stream keep randomly stopping on me?
<ValtheJean> BOTH THE AQUARIAN MAMMALS AND THE COUNTRY
<mib_zfd3bu> for our duel, i shall select the weapons
<mib_zfd3bu> and i choose... NARWHALS
<mib_zfd3bu> narwhals?
<ValtheJean> oh oh oh
<ValtheJean> PLEASE
<mib_zfd3bu> narwhals
<ValtheJean> PLEASE STREAM UNICORNS V NARWHALS
<Quanyails> 7http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/7413/temporaryfilex.png <-- Empty space, yay!
<ValtheJean> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6kNxf6axY4
<ValtheJean> pleeeeaaaaaaaasssseee
<NewDCD> 9yeah it looks better like this
<NewDCD> 9also it's not randomly stopping for you
<Pegacorn> I'm back.
<NewDCD> 9I'm just testing stuff
<ValtheJean> wb pegacorn
<ValtheJean> well, just keep that into consideration :P
<drf|laptop> 03let's see
<Pegacorn> BATMAN UP.
<Barry> wb Pegacorn
<NewDCD> 9guys I'm thinking
<Pegacorn> Dat robot
<NewDCD> 9IN SPAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Pegacorn> dat obvious flash.
<NewDCD> 9Guys
<NewDCD> 9I'm going to
<Pegacorn> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<NewDCD> 9test something DEEPER
<Pegacorn> WUT
<NewDCD> 9something....
<ValtheJean> BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW
<NewDCD> 9REVOLUTIONARY
*ValtheJean needs the inception button link >.<
<NewDCD> 9basically going to test the feasibility of running a low-quality stream parallel to this one
<NewDCD> 9for users with lower bandwidth
<Pegacorn> I have MASSIVE video speed.
<drf|laptop> 03hm that failed
<drf|laptop> 03it made it look like a shadow. LOL
<Quanyails> 7How many shades?
<Quanyails> 7One?
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03basically it made 3 black and white images
<drf|laptop> 03eith with different shades
<drf|laptop> 03but the calculator thought it was pure black andw hite for each
<Quanyails> 7Huh.
<drf|laptop> 03hold on
<Dragoran> o-o
<prince-dari> Is the stream up? Not loading for me.
<Barry> Hi, Dari
<prince-dari> Hey.
<ValtheJean> ohai dari
<Barry> I'm having the same problem
<Barry> brb, I think it's dinner time for me
<NewDCD> 9someone check it out
<NewDCD> 9gonna test PARARELL STREAMS
<NewDCD> 9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
<Polarfire> Is this the right place to ask a help question?
<NewDCD> 9later on I'm gonna blow this one up in size to match the size of this window
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<Pegacorn> dat face
<ValtheJean> should we check even if we have fast connections?
<NewDCD> 9both streams should be up
<NewDCD> 9the link I just sent
<NewDCD> 9is the Low Quality stream
<NewDCD> 9as in you only need .2 Mbps
<prince-dari> Quality looks exactly the same on both to me?
<prince-dari> Maybe it's because it's not moving.
<drf|laptop> 03that is really bizarre
<drf|laptop> 03I'll make a video maybe
<NewDCD> 9exactly because of that
<NewDCD> 9and....playing.
<ValtheJean> yeah, it's hard to tell
<drf|laptop> 03http://i.imgur.com/cSwgP.jpg
<Quanyails> 7Okay. o.o
<drf|laptop> 03that's what it looks like with all 3 images loaded
<NewDCD> 9also consider the low quality stream is a smaller window
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<NewDCD> 9can you
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<NewDCD> 9go fullscreen with both?
<prince-dari> I see it's lower quality now.
<NewDCD> 9and tell me how they look
<prince-dari> I've got both open.
<ValtheJean> well it's definitely a noticeable quality change
<Quanyails> 7Can you adjust the black/white threshold?
<ValtheJean> fluidity wise, it looks the same
<prince-dari> Both work full screen.
<ValtheJean> though is the HQ one meant to be slightly behind?
<NewDCD> 9probably it takes time to encode
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<NewDCD> 9this is great
<NewDCD> 9it equates to higher quality in the main stream
<NewDCD> 9and an alternative for people who are lagging
<prince-dari> Yeah, with higher quality one is further behind.
<ValtheJean> I tip my hat to you DCD
<ValtheJean> well done
<prince-dari> I suppose I could add a button to the site to switch between high/low quality stream.
<NewDCD> 9how's the audio quality on the HQ one?
<prince-dari> Audio's fine on both.
<ValtheJean> eh, the static is noticeable
<prince-dari> But yeah, static.
<ValtheJean> other than that it's fine
<Pegacorn> HUGE static,but fine.
<NewDCD> 9how about now?
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<prince-dari> That's better.
<ValtheJean> still thar
<ValtheJean> ah
<ValtheJean> it's softer now
<prince-dari> The static's only on the HQ one I think?
<Pegacorn> Less audible,but still there.
*ValtheJean thinks he's actually behind on the stream
<NewDCD> 9I think that's due to Stereo Mix
<NewDCD> 9I MIGHT have to switch to VAC
<ValtheJean> out of curiosity, are you purposefully pausing it?
<ValtheJean> because I'm getting sudden pauses occasionally
<NewDCD> 9in some places, yeah
<FreezeFrame> Mmm... chicken and black bean quesadillas.
<NewDCD> 9but not now
*FreezeFrame passes around what he had for dinner.
<FreezeFrame> With chipotle cream cheese
<ValtheJean> hmmm
<NewDCD> 9guys
<NewDCD> 9I wish to ask you something
<ValtheJean> well it seems to happen every 4-5 seconds or so
<NewDCD> 9current audio quality in the main stream is
<NewDCD> 9 128 kbps
<NewDCD> 9I could lower that to 96
<NewDCD> 9and boost video quality
<NewDCD> 9would you like that?
<prince-dari> The HQ was fine for a while alongside the low quality one with me, but yeah, it now freezes every 4-5 seconds.
<NewDCD> 9or do you prefer higher-quality audio?
<ValtheJean> hmmm
<drf|laptop> 03Not sure.'
<drf|laptop> 03I just took a 5 minute video showing what I mean XD
<Pegacorn> Ohai FreezeFrame.
<Cat> probably, Polarfire
<NewDCD> 9probably due to the stress in my net...cause I opened to watch the LQ one
<Cat> what kind of question?
<ValtheJean> well, I would say audio assuming the freeze thing is just a glitch that wouldn't happen
<Pegacorn> Oh lookie!I put a dead Spy on the table!
<ValtheJean> but if lowering audio fixes the freezing, go with that
<Ziltoid> Whats this?
<Polarfire> I would like to change my nickserv password but nickserv keeps running me in circles
*Pegacorn points at the dead Spy he put on the table earlier
<Ziltoid> stream is down for me
<ValtheJean> @Ziltoid DCD is experimenting with stream quality
<Ziltoid> ok
<Pegacorn> Now i must find out just who this Spy is.
<NewDCD> 9lowered audio quality on both
<NewDCD> 9increased video quality on the main one
*Pegacorn ponders yet again about it
<NewDCD> 9tell me your experiencese
<NewDCD> 9*experiences
<prince-dari> Static on HQ one, I closed the low quality one.
<Ziltoid> what is this?
<ValtheJean> okay, as far as the HQ goes (accidentally closed the low one)
<prince-dari> Ah ok.
<ValtheJean> The static is more prevalent, BUT the video doesn't freeze
<ValtheJean> if I had to choose between video and audio, I'd vote video
<NewDCD> 9roger that, then
<Pegacorn> .......GODDAMNIT GUYS HELP ME!
<Creideiki> You know the annoying meme "(Bleep)ing magnets, how do they work?" I'd like to start my variant of that meme: "(Bleep)ing Windows, why is it (bleep)?"
<ValtheJean> did you pause it?
<NewDCD> 9I'll be fixing audio soon
<prince-dari> It still freezes for me but a lot less common.
<ValtheJean> because the freezing is starting up again
<NewDCD> 9no, I didn't pause it
<Ziltoid> its buffering for me
<ValtheJean> then yeah, the freezing seems to be unrelated to audio quality
<NewDCD> 9gonna lower video quality on the main one
<Pegacorn> WHY DOES EVERYPONY IGNORE ME?!
<HyperMetalLugia> Only if you use a version that is 7+ years old
<drf|laptop> 03OK,. uploading.
<ValtheJean> Pegacorn sorry, but I don't RP
<Ziltoid> gah I dont know whats going
<NewDCD> 9lower end of the audio quality spectrum for both
<NewDCD> 9video reverted on the HQ one
<NewDCD> 9streaming both at the same time
<NewDCD> 9testing for fluidity
<Creideiki> HyperMetalLugia: So, Win XP usually works nicely, but it - for reasons unexplained - decided to "lose" my sound card.
<Creideiki> Necessitating a very annoying reboot.
<NewDCD> 9how is the HQ one right now?
<ValtheJean> no freezing- YET
<ValtheJean> oh
<ValtheJean> there it is
<Creideiki> (Annoying due to the fact that I had to shut down several emulated systems that I am the host of.)
<NewDCD> 9gonna close the LQ stream
<ValtheJean> and now it's....gone?
<NewDCD> 9watch for a minute, and then tell me
<ValtheJean> lol on a random note
<ValtheJean> this episode was totally inspired by ME2
<NewDCD> 9any freezing thus far?
<ValtheJean> nope
<NewDCD> 9going to restart the LQ stream
<Ziltoid> im freezing but my internets bad
<NewDCD> 9re-streaming the LQ stream as well
<NewDCD> 9Ziltoid
<NewDCD> 9test the Low-Quality stream
<NewDCD> 9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
<Ziltoid> where?
<Ziltoid> oh ok
<NewDCD> 9we're testing for parallel streams, actually
<Pegacorn> Dat parrallel stream
<NewDCD> 9any freezing so far?
<Ziltoid> lq is offline
<Luna> That sucks
<ValtheJean> nope
<ValtheJean> looks good to me
<Ziltoid> for me anyway
<NewDCD> 9going offline
<NewDCD> 9restarting both
<Creideiki> To put it lightly... when I reboot my PC I have to:
<ValtheJean> kk
<Creideiki> 1. Reboot a MicroVAX 3900 running VMS 7.3.
<Creideiki> 2. Reboot a VAX 11/780 running an Ultrix variant (can't remember the version).
<Creideiki> 3. Reboot a PDP-11/70 running RSTS/E 10.1.
<Creideiki> 4. Reboot a quad processor PDP-11/74 running RSX-11/M+.
<NewDCD> 9both should be live now
<Creideiki> 5. Reboot a KS-10 running TOPS-10.
<Creideiki> 6. Reboot a KL-10 running TOPS-20.
<Creideiki> And finally: 7. Reboot a PDP-15/XVM running XVM/RSX.
<Dragoran> Skylands ):
<NewDCD> 9Ziltoid
<NewDCD> 9LQ should be live now
<NewDCD> 9go check it out
<Ziltoid> yeah
<Ziltoid> I got it
<NewDCD> 9testing both
<NewDCD> 9guys, tell me about your experiences with them
<ValtheJean> will do
<NewDCD> 9playing
<ValtheJean> pause within the first second
<ValtheJean> intentional?
<NewDCD> 9keep watching and just tell me how it runs
<Polarfire> I believe the one I want is setpass but I don't understand the syntax.
<Ziltoid> I dont buffer on hq
<Ziltoid> I lmean lq
<Polarfire> the command, I mean
<prince-dari> No freezing on HQ yet.
<Ziltoid> bit of static but no big deal
<Dermathil> back
<Dermathil> (my god, I haven't seen anything like that since Avatar.)
<Dermathil> The movie theater's lobby was FULL
<Ascendant> Why do you even have such a setup?
<drf|laptop> 03^
<drf|laptop> 03and hi Ascendant
<NewDCD> 9I think this exam is satisfactory?
<Ascendant> heya
<ValtheJean> yeah, no freezes
<Dermathil> like, opening the door meant almost pushing the door in people.
<HyperMetalLugia> Why not put it all in the startup folder 8D
<prince-dari> Freeze.
<NewDCD> 9roger
<prince-dari> On HQ.
<Ascendant> haha HML
<ValtheJean> you sure dari?
<ValtheJean> it only froze at the beginning for me
<NewDCD> 9will save these settings
<NewDCD> 9what are your dl speeds, guys?
<prince-dari> Well it just starting freezing for me on HQ too.
<prince-dari> Then went offline. O_o
<ValtheJean> uhh...I have no idea
<ValtheJean> where can I find out?
<NewDCD> 9Val, still running for you?
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<prince-dari> According to speedtest.net mine is 10mbps
<Ziltoid> lq is still up
<NewDCD> 9http://speedtest.net
<NewDCD> 9prince-dari, press play again
<prince-dari> Ok, playing again.
<prince-dari> Freezing again.
<Luna> lol
<ReticentSmolder> heya
<ValtheJean> 12.39 for me
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Dermathil> so, anybody see what I type?
<Creideiki> Ascendant: Various reasons. Also, it makes the extra gigabit ethernet port on my PC actually do something.
<prince-dari> Well it froze once.
<prince-dari> Yes Dermathil.
<Dermathil> whew
<prince-dari> Seems to be fine now.
<NewDCD> 9I do
<Creideiki> (Even if it is host to only the enthertubes interface for the 11's and VAXen.)
<ReticentSmolder> I do
<Nightseas> 12Hello drf
<Creideiki> (...Speaking of VAXen, I can also get Minecraft server running on one.)
<ReticentSmolder> when I first saw this I thought, OMG THEY BROUGHT BACK TEEN TITANS...mfw that wasn't the case
<prince-dari> Ok, it's alright now.
<NewDCD> 9gonna keep this running as a stress test
<Ascendant> haha Creideiki
<ValtheJean> yeah...I miss Teen Titans
<ValtheJean> oh
<prince-dari> ...
<ValtheJean> just had a pause
<ValtheJean> again
<prince-dari> Then it froze once again.
<prince-dari> And agai.
<NewDCD> 9also ReticentSmolder: this is MUCH better than TT...even if I liked TT
<prince-dari> again*
<ReticentSmolder> what is this>
<Dermathil> freezing
<Ascendant> minecraft is useless so why bother? :p
<Dermathil> freezing
<prince-dari> Offline
<Dermathil> OFFLINE
<ReticentSmolder> ?
<NewDCD> 9I think I know why
<ValtheJean> dude, TT was awesome
<NewDCD> 9give me a moment
<NewDCD> 9it WAS
<NewDCD> 9but this is even better
<Ziltoid> this seems alot more serious then TT
<ValtheJean> eh...I've yet to be convinced by it
<ValtheJean> I prefer Justice League imo
<Ziltoid> lq is offline
<ValtheJean> well, justice league before the radical artistic change
<Creideiki> Well, it makes the VAX do something other then go "I'm in a cluster." :P
<NewDCD> 9back up
<drf|laptop> 03alright, Quanyails

<ValtheJean> oh
<prince-dari> Can you not just stream with FME open once, 2 vide bitrates, and the backup URL filled?
<NewDCD> 9lowered video quality on HQ one SLIGHTLY
<ValtheJean> for my download speed:
<ValtheJean> it should be noted I'm running 3 email clients, 3ds Max and Skype
<ValtheJean> (work related stuff)
<NewDCD> 9dari: I don't know. I'm using two different instances of FME. I'll look into it
<NewDCD> 9okay, testing again
<interior_gummy> anypony here?
<NewDCD> 9we are
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<NewDCD> 9doing quality tests
<interior_gummy> what cartoon is this?
<NewDCD> 9Young Justice
<NewDCD> 9how is it running?
<ValtheJean> did you pause it?
<interior_gummy> how is it>
<prince-dari> Just froze on HQ
<ValtheJean> because it was fine until just now
<Dermathil> can't make it paly
<NewDCD> 9FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
<NewDCD> 9how about now?
<ValtheJean> doing good
<interior_gummy> how is the show?
<prince-dari> Not freezing at the moment.
<Pegacorn> Ohai interior_gummy
<NewDCD> 9it's a pretty good show
<interior_gummy> oh hi pegacorn
<ReticentSmolder> so what show is this?
<ValtheJean> howdy gummy
<interior_gummy> oh hi NewDCD
<interior_gummy> oh hi dari
<NewDCD> 9Young Justice
<interior_gummy> oh hi Reticent
<ReticentSmolder> heya
<interior_gummy> oh hi Val
<Ziltoid> oh he mad
<interior_gummy> oh hi ziltoid
<interior_gummy> oh hi doggy
<ReticentSmolder> so this is like Justice Leagu meets teen titans?
<interior_gummy> oh hi chanserv
<Ziltoid> hi gummy
<interior_gummy> oh hi mark
<interior_gummy> oh hi superman
<interior_gummy> oh hi robin
<ReticentSmolder> robin...is kind of a weenie here compared to his role in TT
<Pegacorn> INTERIOR SUPERMAN ALIGATOR.
<interior_gummy> oh hi scientist dude
<NewDCD> 9no problems yet?
<ValtheJean> robin is ALWAYS a weeny outside of TT
<ValtheJean> nopers
<Pegacorn> ROBIN IS BABY!
<Pegacorn> (lol Heavy Weapons Guy)
<ReticentSmolder> @ValtheJean I think TT was the first series to make Robin look like a badass leader
<interior_gummy> air vent escape was busted by mythbusters
<ValtheJean> agreed
<NewDCD> 9MOTION SENSORS
<ReticentSmolder> wait, so now robin has been demoted to tech weenie?
<ValtheJean> ung...robin's tech in this is just a fancy magic system
<NewDCD> 9not really
<NewDCD> 9Robin in this series: The Tactician
<NewDCD> 9and that is AWESOME
<interior_gummy> robin=twilight sparkle
<ValtheJean> I'll need to see more episodes then
<NewDCD> 9because he's Tim Drake
<ReticentSmolder> oh, that's alright I guess, but TT made him a fucking ninja
<ValtheJean> because this episode isn't doing him justice
<NewDCD> 9TT Robin was probably Dick Grayson
<ValtheJean> also, he's totally biting off of ME
<NewDCD> 9YJ Robin is probably Tim Drake
<Pegacorn> .....Twilight Sparkle is less of a wimp than Robin.
<interior_gummy> beast boy was the shit on that show
<NewDCD> 9Dick: ACROBATICS UP THE ASS, even better in combat than Batman
<NewDCD> 9Tim: THE TACTICIAN, even smarter than Batman in when it comes to that sort of stuff
<interior_gummy> in that case, fluttershy=robin?
<NewDCD> 9quite frankly, in this series, Robin = Lelouch would be a closer comparison
<interior_gummy> I CHOOSE YOU PIKACHU
<ValtheJean> >mfw I have no idea who you've been referencing
<Ziltoid> oh man
<NewDCD> 9and quite frankly I prefer Tim!Robin
<NewDCD> 9a tactician is funner
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<ReticentSmolder> honestly, I think your praise is a little misplaced NewDCD, or at least from what I've seen so far
<NewDCD> 9and you'll see why in the next battle
<interior_gummy> he looks like penn jilette
<FreezeFrame> Jason: The dead one.
<NewDCD> 9Jason: The Vicious One as well
<ValtheJean> why does it always end with the bad guy drinking/injecting something and turning into a beast?
<NewDCD> 9since he ain't so dead no more
<interior_gummy> FOOL! YOU'VE ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD!
<prince-dari> Dat floor squeek
<ReticentSmolder> TT had this nice style and flow to fights, I'm not sure about these just yet, lots of wide angle posing like Justice League
<interior_gummy> i thought he was invincible?
<FreezeFrame> Also, since this is Superboy, he gets to use dat Tactile Telekinesis.
<FreezeFrame> I like this Aqualad
<ValtheJean> wait...so aquaman's son is just a Greenlanturn with water?
<FreezeFrame> Water manipulation powers
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, this aqualad is pretty tight, TT's awualad is how most people view Robin
<Ziltoid> derp
<ValtheJean> aqua lad was in TT?
<ValtheJean> man...I really should have finished that series
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, he led Titans East
<ValtheJean> titans...east?
<ValtheJean> jesus how long did that show last?
<ValtheJean> I saw like the first two seasons
<ReticentSmolder> there was a second team of titans with a different cast of characters that made a few appearances
<drf|laptop> 03ROFL, there's a car part called a Car bra
<nickstr> I knew that long ago
<NewDCD> 9DEM TACTICS
<FreezeFrame> Also, Aqualad has super strength and some invuln.
<drf|laptop> 03what's it do o.o
<Cat> that's... beyond me in my current state, sorry
<drf|laptop> 03and sigh, I need to pay $50 to replace my mirrir
<interior_gummy> dat super strength
<drf|laptop> 03*mirror
<NewDCD> 9LUNA'S MOON
<Cat> I'm not exactly au fait with the functions of Nickserv :P
<ReticentSmolder> led by awualad, had max y minos, 2 latin twins who were really fast, but only when in contact with each other, silver arrow, Green Arrow's sidekick or w/e those names are, and...I forget the chick's name
<ValtheJean> and then he turns into a giant monkey
<NewDCD> 9Bumblebee I think
<interior_gummy> wasnt it jinx or something?
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, bumblebee
<ReticentSmolder> no, Jinx was bad
<interior_gummy> nvm, jinx was a villain
<Ziltoid> OH HAI EVERYONE
<drf|laptop> 03oh, the thing that goes over the front?
<interior_gummy> oh hi doggy
<ValtheJean> howdy ziltoid
<FreezeFrame> Hal and John
<ReticentSmolder> <----------- was totally obsessed with TT and super upset when it got cancelled
<Pegacorn> IS THAT A CHALLENGE?
<Ziltoid> hi val
<ReticentSmolder> no?
<interior_gummy> BITCH
<FreezeFrame> Who's the dude with the awesome suit and top hat?
<Ascendant> My brother is a B.R.A
<Ascendant> battle ready armour
<ValtheJean> Twisted Fat....haha nah j/k
<Ascendant> ahem
<Ascendant> anyway
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<FreezeFrame> Only one I don't recognize.
<ValtheJean> Fate*
<drf|laptop> 03live chat
<drf|laptop> 03talking to a guy named Pedro
<drf|laptop> 03>Illegal Mexican
<ReticentSmolder> twisted fat sounds like a villain :P
<NewDCD> 9oh Supes, y u don't know how to treat your "kid"
<interior_gummy> ghostbusters
<Ziltoid> batman is not amused
<Ascendant> .-.
<ValtheJean> oh fuck that shit
<ReticentSmolder> ewwww......webbed hands
<ValtheJean> when batman tells you not to
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<ValtheJean> you bend the fuck over
<HyperMetalLugia> Wut
<ValtheJean> and take it
<NewDCD> 9also Aqualad's the team leader here I think
<interior_gummy> isn't robin technically a child laborer?
<Quanyails> 7Well, that video finally finished loading. XD
<Quanyails> 7And I watched it all the way through.
<ReticentSmolder> yes? he doesn't get paid though
<Pegacorn> *trollface*
<drf|laptop> 03if you're into small images, you should try making calculator pictures :P
<NewDCD> 9you are now drooling
<ReticentSmolder> obligatory female
<ValtheJean> phffff
<Ziltoid> hawt
<ValtheJean> batman is stealthy enough
<drf|laptop> 03I dunno how the program works, it lets you do 6-color greyscale images using 3 2-color pictures, but eh
<Pegacorn> WTF
<ValtheJean> wait...WHAT
<Quanyails> 7Eh, sprites did originate from such limitations. :P
<ValtheJean> HIS FAMILY IS DEAD
<NewDCD> 9HNGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
<ValtheJean> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<ValtheJean> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Pegacorn> IT.IS.ON.
<Ziltoid> lawl
<ReticentSmolder> martian manhunter didn't get enough screentime
<prince-dari> Awkward.
<ValtheJean> god damn it
<ValtheJean> every single time
<ValtheJean> there's someone who's "the last of their kind"
<ValtheJean> it's always like: "Oh surprise! Illegitimate child" or some shit
<Quanyails> 7And that program you had looked cool; 3D?
<ReticentSmolder> wouldn't it make sense that she was his daughter and not niece?
<interior_gummy> dat offline
<prince-dari> Suddenly stream offline?
<drf|laptop> 03it's called Image Studio
<Ziltoid> eeyup
<Pegacorn> GODDAMNIT YOUNG JUSTICE.

<prince-dari> DCD
<NewDCD> 9I was
<NewDCD> 9so guys
<ValtheJean> me sowwy...I'll stop insulting YJ now >.<
<NewDCD> 9it didn't skip much?
<ValtheJean> nope
<interior_gummy> it was okay for me
<ValtheJean> fluid like a river
<Ziltoid> lq is fine
<interior_gummy> or...a stream
<prince-dari> HQ was fine too.
<Ziltoid> just a bit of static
<ValtheJean> @gummy icwutudidthar
<Ziltoid> AAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
<NewDCD> 9I will fix the static before Friday
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.ticalc.org/pub/win/graphics/istudio.zip
<NewDCD> 9and will have both quality streams up and running
<ValtheJean> all I can say is: "Bravo good sir"
<ValtheJean> keep being awesome ;)
<ReticentSmolder> well, I bet with 200 bronies on the HQ stream would get bogged down fast
<Nightseas> 12bbl
<ValtheJean> I don't think the number matters
<NewDCD> 9number doesn't matter
<ValtheJean> because it's his upload speed to our download speed
<ValtheJean> we just connect to the server he uploads to (if I understand the tech right)
<NewDCD> 9I stream data to the Veemi servers, which can handle loads on the tens of millions
<prince-dari> What are you gunna stream now?
<prince-dari> Dai-guard?
<ReticentSmolder> challenge accepted?

<drf|laptop> 03etc
<Quanyails> 7Well, in a divorce, both persons need to agree on it.
<Quanyails> 7One of the two probably won't.
<Sakuya> I'd say what drf said, but then I need to ask what do you mean and why do you ask

<stripes> hello Dermathil
<Luna> How is that an LOL situation drf? ):
<Ascendant> my parents divorced
<Sakuya> It also depends on the state
<Ascendant> in 2003
<Kosoveon> my parents married when I was two, divorced when I was five
<Sakuya> As its possible that there are different procedures
<Luna> My parents were married in 2001 but they were together a long time before
<Sakuya> But I believe that the consenting one would call a court day, both would appear in court
<drf|laptop> 03<Kosoveon> my parents married when I was two, divorced when I was five <- so in other words they married because they wanted to raise you properly and then realized that wasn't going to work? :P
<drf|laptop> 03I've watched too much TV LOL
<drf|laptop> 03sigh, I need someone who's good at chemistry to explain sigma and pi bonds :/

<PizzaPony> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Dermathil> He would've made a great companion.
<Ziltoid> yeah
<FreezeFrame> I feel the need to do a reading of Witch of the Westmareland.
<Ziltoid> I wish jackie wasnt a cunt all the time
<PizzaPony> you feel the need to read all of Past Sins to us
<FreezeFrame> She lightens up
<FreezeFrame> Not for Eccleston, but she lightens up for Tennant
<Ziltoid> well sort of
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> She prefers Tennant a great lot.
<Ziltoid> I still dont like her

<prince-dari> I think Donna is the best simply because she's so funny. XD
<PizzaPony> silvermare?
<stripes> tennant is so good everyone prefers being around him!
<prince-dari> For some reason I don't even really remember/think of Amy when I think of the Doctor's companions.
<Nittany_Tiger> Fuck yeah. Full-screen brony state streaming on my TV.
<Ziltoid> amys cool
<prince-dari> It must be because I associate her with Smith.
<drf|laptop> 03frick, I think I screwed up my sitsers' computer
<Ziltoid> Why do you hate smith so much?
<Dermathil> SMITH IS A PRICK
<FreezeFrame> I like Rory because he's the only companion who doesn't freak out about the "Bigger on the inside than the outside" thing.
<prince-dari> I don't think he can act and he took the job of someone who could have been an awesome Doctor.
<Nittany_Tiger> If only I still have my hi-def.
