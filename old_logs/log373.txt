<Randomnerd> Byeeee
<Meanwhile> If I win B movie I'll be there just for the chat reaction to everything about it.
<mmendo24> Another good song is Bolo Ta Ra Ra- by Daler Mehendi

<Buytoast> Chickens lay eggs.
<K_A> I love how this music explodes at points of revelation, too.
<PinkyPie> To be continued
<Buytoast> Scootaloo is a chicken.
<CriticKitten> It's a cultural thing, yo. It's not bad acting. >_>
<Buytoast> Therefore, Babli is Scootaloo.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh you rascal, PinkyPie~

<Meanwhile> I personally think it's just stupid.
<Kencolt> I'm fine, Mamma. I[m just an interbationally wanted criminal.
<flutter_spin> Should I be feeling anything other than vast confusion and laughter?
<topsecret> she cries too much
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Maybe he's that guy from James Bond

<CCCP> bbrb
<flutterfan> man aaaaaa's
<TOY_PON3> I don't get it..
<CriticKitten> In their culture, family is usually very, very close by comparison to western cultures. It's not unusual for someone raised like her in that culture to be distressed and homesick. >.>
<Dinozar415> sad face;
<flutter_spin> lol
<Ponybrine> so sad bad dad
<K_A> The funny part is, he's clearly annoyed by it, too.

<PinkyPie> The scooter: Part two. START NOW
<mario_pony> hello everypony i'm back! man god of war is a fun game!

<RAWRity> Meanwhile is lactose intolerant.
<Buytoast> Why was that kid in my friggin' pool?
<K_A> CriticKitten: It's amazing, too, that many of them come over here to America all the way from home, anyway, to pursue their education.
<TOY_PON3> I think IshBestPony should choose all movies that we watch
<[wub]Nidalee> Mods are delicious.
<Meanwhile> I'm not. I just hate cheese.
<PinkyPie> I wonder if Scoot-Scootaloo is coming to kill me...
<RAWRity> in other words, Meanwhile is a CHEESE RACIST.
<TOY_PON3> :O
<somberguy> CUMQUAT CUMQUAT CUMQUAT AND PICKLE BARREL
<Meanwhile> I am. Cheese should go back where it came from. Hell.
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile is Dan

<[wub]Nidalee> seeing as I don't actually watch any
<flutter_spin> he blown it up? Did I miss the cool explosions?
*Scoot-Scootaloo appears behind PinkyPie
<Meanwhile> Who wants to eat bucking old milk.
<Meanwhile> That's what it is
<Buytoast> Turnip pickle.
<PinkyPie> AAH!
<Djambi> turnip pickle!
<CriticKitten> It really is. But for them, it's essential to get a good education and make worth of oneself. It's a cultural drive that Americans no longer have. >_>
<Meanwhile> Old milk
<StinkomanFan> Short, angry, and loctose intolerant

*PinkyPie falls onto rarity and she runs over to 1 mile away
<flutter_spin> That shirt is crying too loud.
<Midnight_Fire> Their society is much more stratified than ours, so it's a strong encouragement to make something of oneself
<CCCP> Some one needs to make a PMV of the songs in this!!!
<flutter_spin> uh oh.

<RainbowcrashNBurn> i think thats the latest EqD have ever been?
<TOY_PON3> IshBestPony: Who knows bro
<mario_pony> damn she is FINE!!!!
<K_A> One interesting thing is that many of them pursue education in engineering and business, not so much pure science and liberal arts.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Can't say the same about PinkyPie...

<IshBestPony> Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back foar B movie
<CriticKitten> K_A: It's because engineering and business degrees are the big ones that bring lots of cash and innovation. Then they take that education back to their country and use it to better themselves and the country. Liberal arts and pure science is somewhat harder to apply to life, but they're doing well in those fields too.
<mario_pony> HAT!!!

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> But just because it has a small budget doesn't mean it has to be bad.

<DeadlyDerp3> 90 of the movie was spent making the sets :P
<unfoundbug> boom the dancefloor!
<K_A> I like this better than any musical I've seen by Western directors.
<Tovler> if 18 million is high-budget, then 92 million certainly is.
<somberguy> sexypretender stop being a sexy pretender your not fooling anyone
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: 5 months
<flutter_spin> Why is it that I no longer find Japanese movies weird, but this is creeping me out?

<Dismo> Stop complaining, If you don't like the movie, FUcking do something else untill ponies are on. Someone who likes this movie piked it, How would you feel if someone mocked a movie you picked. It's annoying and rude. Stop.
<otakon> and then suddenly serious
<somberguy> let me just I love your videos
<CriticKitten> It's true.....India has honestly surpassed Western culture in terms of good musical choreography and dance. They make such fantastic work these days that anyone who isn't cultured in Bollywood yet really SHOULD get cultured in it.
<pony_2312> Why not topscret
<MrPoniator> Haha, glad ya like 'em

<RanDT1-stallion> wooo another compsci eh?
<otakon> BaconBaconBaconBacon:
*CriticKitten doesn't understand how people can claim this doesn't have a plot, it clearly does and it makes perfect sense too. xD
<[wub]Nidalee> In recent BBC news, cancer can cause cancer
<otakon> lol
<MattGrubbTV> See ya in a few!
<flutter_spin> trumpet?
<Randomnerd> Look, the the US has the same problem as every empire before it, it's long on power, and short on morality. There's no science to it. In a few years, we'll all be moaning about China.

*JarlCelestia places baconbaconbaconbacon on his head
<pony_2312> I hate you homage
<Darf14> ITs kinda obvious on what my Xbox gamer tag is
*BaconBaconBaconBacon sticks bacon tongue out at JarlCelestia and runs away
<somberguy> im really hateing this movie at this point
<K_A> If I get a next-gen console, it will likely be a PS3 so I can play the next Persona and SMT.
<CuddlyKittens11> Ah, get started on programming ASAP.
<Kencolt> Non-veg.... WUT.
<homage> :C why?
<d3rb> ps3 is pretty sweet

<Mutterguy> s/he's jelly
<graypaw> i know some basics but camp is so expensive;.;
<CuddlyKittens11> I'm at RIT right now, they do have a Game Design Major, but it's highly compettative, and expensive.
<StinkomanFan> Um LC, your hair was sitting in the Trophycase...
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> http://lh3.ggpht.com/_zGnH6HWaAi0/S57lpDu4KFI/AAAAAAAAFNA/4Vw5tmjW-6o/lots_of_bacon.png
<StinkomanFan> That was somepony else
<Meanwhile> My personal theory is that we sent all the convicts to Australia and the thickies to America. Dohoho.
<flutter_spin> noooo. I wanted to see it slammed
<richfiles> Sooooo.... What the haybaconstrips are we watching? I forgot it was friday, and just now showed up. :$
<CuddlyKittens11> I actually came in as a Game Design Major, but I switched to CS after half a day.
<ncb_LuckyStampede> How long is this movie?
<NullRadix> one would argue America is no longer walking softly
<pony_2312> This plot is written on the fly, events happen with no build up
<TechRat> wow...that's deep, man
<fillyfillyy> flutter_spin: it...IT!!!!!!!
<sklar> it done stop
<MattGrubbTV> Back
<tgl1992> should be roughly 40 minuets left in this movie?
<TechRat> half a day cuddly? It was that intense?
<MattGrubbTV> Had to lock my door
<unfoundbug> get some nuts!
<homage> Pony_2312: why do you hate me?
<RanDT1-stallion> ((que dramatic music))
<CriticKitten> Anon pony: wut
<RAWRity> BaconBaconBaconBacon: I see you found JarlCelestia's midmorning snack.
<[wub]Nidalee> Ohyes.
<StinkomanFan> How about I move to Canada? That's essentially a giant Wisconsin
<flutter_spin> a baby is born
<[wub]Nidalee> relating to that BBC article
<MrMaxaminus> The editing in this is...interesting.
<[wub]Nidalee> guess where otakons going to move
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I've heard RIT is a great school when it comes to getting in the game business
<SlurryMoon> 36 (singular) Month
<owlicious> dat bribe
<pony_2312> My love life sucks
<CriticKitten> I really don't get what is hard to understand about the film's plot. >_>
<Sumica> 00,10So what did I miss? Went to go make tacos
<otakon> where?
<Meanwhile> Paris.
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> bacon bacon bacon RAWRity
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: "Giant wisconson". and you DON'T find this terrifying?
<Darf14> 6 months past
<CuddlyKittens11> No, it was just that I wanted to switch during orientation week, but I missed the office and I had to wait till monday to get a meeting.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> to the moon ?
<tgl1992> Sumica, how much time left!? :(
<MattGrubbTV> mmm tacos
<Vinyl_Scratch> 11 mor hours i cant wait
<Mutterguy> Damn it Murdock!
<Meanwhile> Beeyeeeetch
<StinkomanFan> I'm FROM Wisconsin!
<otakon> lol
<TechRat> @sumica - that probably makes more sense to the plot than the plot itself
<homage> That sucks...
<otakon> :D
<otakon> :P
<CriticKitten> It's pretty clear and concise, you'd have to just not be paying attention to miss it.
<otakon> XD
<Mutterguy> I taking you off the case!
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: then you should know better!
<flutter_spin> Is he a pilot?
<CuddlyKittens11> Game Design is actually considered an easy Major around here, but A LOT of people apply for it.
<StinkomanFan> I'm used to the horrors
<Tymo> The wayc this is cut together...it makes them seem like they're talking to a wall
<CuddlyKittens11> CS @ RIT is actually VERY vicious.
<TechRat> turn in your badge, mcgillicutty!
<RanDT1-stallion> I prefer Comp security /networking
<StinkomanFan> Also, Worlds Largest Mall is in Canada
<Sumica> 00,10an hour
<Randomnerd> I can't go there, I've got an allergy to milk.
<Darf14> long movie is looooong
<CuddlyKittens11> We have a 66% drop rate for the incomming freshman within the first year.
<graypaw> Rit Is actually pretty close. huh I wonder why I havent heard of it before now.
<sklar> i prefer gun
<Tymo> What ever happened to the 180 rule O.o
<RAWRity> also, from what I hear, a lot of Canada kinda sucks.
<pony_2312> Because game designing is cool
<MattGrubbTV> okay, I'm going to play xbox now
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03one more hour :3
<Meanwhile> DUN DUN DUUUUUN
<MattGrubbTV> GT: thegrubbmafia
<unfoundbug> that sound effect
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol that music
<MattGrubbTV> See you all in an hour
<Vinyl_Scratch> 11 more hours until next mlp episode
<Midnight_Fire> DUNDUNDUN
<K_A> I honestly wished I took up game programming or CS instead of CPE. CPE is not only not well recognized; it is actually fairly saturated.
<CuddlyKittens11> RIT is always that collge someone has heard about, but never really knowns anything about.
<DeadlyDerp3> ...No offense, but the guy is actually good
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Bacon-wrapped_banana.jpg
<StinkomanFan> Better then being Nuked by random countries RAWRity
<TechRat> game design IS cool...but it also becomes your LIFE.
<CuddlyKittens11> CPE?
<fluttercry> 05,15bigger than the Mall of America?
<K_A> Graphics programming, I should say.
<flutter_spin> lol
<CuddlyKittens11> Ah.
<TechRat> You need to devote yourself to it, or don't bother.
<Djambi> did...that guy grow a couple of feet?
<RaveBrony> Aw! Im drawing a steampunk pony!! D:
<K_A> CuddlyKittens11: Computer engineering
<flutter_spin> all the rum!
<StinkomanFan> Yes Fluttercry
<Buytoast> I wouldn't mind game design becoming my mind.
<Meanwhile> I don't even like bacon that much.
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: implying Canada wouldn't be attacked as an ally to the US.
<Buytoast> I would assimilate with my computer.
<fluttercry> 05,15holy crap that's big
<CriticKitten> K_A: Inorite, my bachelor's degree was effectively worthless with the recession.
<[wub]Nidalee> its funny because they actually are related
<Buytoast> And become one with the internet.
<CuddlyKittens11> K_A: we just call it CE here.
<owlicious> hah
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> bacon bacon bacon Meanwhile :|
<Whiskra> well, clock is 5 in the morning now, cya all tomorrow for new episode
<graypaw> I have to get off now D: Mom wont let me stay on. Guess Ill have to go on tomorrow and catch the end of the movie. Good night all!
<Whiskra> gonna hit the hay hard
<Meanwhile> BaconBaconBaconBacon: I do not like you.
<flutter_spin> Beer for everyone!
<Meanwhile> Much.
<Vinyl_Scratch> now 10 h. and 58 mins.
<CCCP> ^
<CuddlyKittens11> I still want to work in games, but I want to do the more techinal side of things, like game engine design, or graphics.
<CriticKitten> CuddlyKittens11: That's Civil Engineering usually.
<Sumica> 00,10Oh shi they are in the same room.
<graypaw> see you next week!
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> Bacon
<pony_2312> I would like to write a video game plot
<[wub]Nidalee> dat dramatic musik
<K_A> CriticKitten: I've been working at a factory for the last six months. And what I'm doing right now is actually Web development. So, yeah.
<StinkomanFan> Woah woah BaconBaconBaconBacon, no need to swear
<flutter_spin> Somepony is going to get wasted tonight
<CCCP> pony_2312: make fan fics
<homage> lol, what a twist
<pony_2312> But i thought beer sucks
<Meanwhile> Bacon is fine as part of a full monty but otherwise, eh.
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> bacon StinkomanFan L)
<K_A> Well, I was at a factory until I got a Web dev position this week.
<StinkomanFan> We're all freinds here
<CuddlyKittens11> CriticKitten: We got like 4,000 different types of engineering majors here, it's hard to keep track
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> *:(
<CriticKitten> Yeah. I didn't get anywhere with the degree myself
<TechRat> right now I'm a web programmer - for a light switch company.
<CriticKitten> Had to take up teaching and get a Masters.
<TechRat> Exciting, huh?
<pony_2312> I want to buyt it is hard
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: stop being mean to everypony
<flutter_spin> Computer Programming. Frustrating work it is.
<d3rb> jopb is a job
<Meanwhile> Not being mean, being honest.
<CuddlyKittens11> flutter_spin: it not neccessary the programming aspect, it's the design.
<RanDT1-stallion> Cudly: I make more money with Hands on CLients. No degree or anything : /
<flutter_spin> I rather be a chef.
<StinkomanFan> I know he hurt your feelings but as a wise man once said "Let he without sin cast the first stone"
<CriticKitten> Good news is, though, I could always go back for a second Masters in engineering if I want to. Once I have money.
<unfoundbug> What language?
<pony_2312> But it is cool
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> bacon Meanwhile :(
<Sumica> 00,10did they scam the guy on the taj?
<Randomnerd> Oh, my head.
<CuddlyKittens11> believe it or not, i spend 3/4 of my time designing a program and only 1/4 implementing it.
<MrMaxaminus> Yeah
<Buytoast> I believe so.
<Darf14> I dont think so
<Meanwhile> Mother didn't raise no liar. Even though she kinda wishes she did because I made her cry last month.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, Sumica
<richfiles> How many viewers are not watching the movie... :$ Err... I mean watching and totally paying attention as they talk about game dev and careers, and classes, and stuff! :D
<Sumica> 00,10nice
<Darf14> then again I am only paying attention to chat
<TechRat> That's the way to do it cuddly.
<pony_2312> I want to be a screenwriter
<RanDT1-stallion> I found Programmin Fun :) C and C++
<K_A> CuddlyKittens11: That's a good practice. I have to think thoroughly on the design even while coding.
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> :[Bacon...Bacon...Bacon BACON BACON
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile's just angry because he's short
<flutter_spin> lol
<CuddlyKittens11> I'm also thinking about getting a double major here with Animation.
<StinkomanFan> Woah Bacon! Calm down!
<Darf14> Im a Wright3rs!
<CuddlyKittens11> And a minor in creative writing.
<flutter_spin> Who is this man? Who cares? What is going on?
<TechRat> yeah.....that's the best way. I should really follow that approach as well.....
<Meanwhile> If I was angry about being short I'd have had an anuerysm at age 12.
<StinkomanFan> Don't say something that'll get you banned
<MrMaxaminus> Lol she's prego and cranky
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> bacon StinkomanFan :'(

<pony_2312> She PMSing
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*whip crack sound*
<CuddlyKittens11> CS & SE here actually have the most liberal arts requirements out of any other major. We actually have to get a Liberal Arts Minor or equivilent.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03>Spoilt
<fluttercry> 05,15let's just calm down a bit. k?
<Meanwhile> Besides, I like tall folk, and from my position that's a larger group than usual~
<StinkomanFan> It's ok man, you didn't mean it

<StinkomanFan> He's just kidding around Bacon, he'll grow to like you eventually
<Randomnerd> no

<CriticKitten> My goodness, some of you are such whiners. This is a good movie, just because it doesn't have explosions doesn't make it bad. A little culture won't kill you. >_>
<Kencolt> There are many genre's of motion Picture. in Bollywood, it's a good idea to cram ALL of them into the same flick. Saves time and money.

<Cabrony> Rarity doesnt whine,she is a lady ;)
<Sumica> 00,10I pop my neck like that all the time.
<TheNuclearPeaceKeepe> This is bollywood. Musical numbers dont HAVE to make sense.
<otakon> Meanwhile: this bacon is DIFFERENT!
<Djambi> that cop is just too awesome
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...oh man, if MLP had a Bollywood parody...
<[wub]Nidalee> I should give the cop a tag
<Phase4> RAWRity: h..how...
<Mutterguy> CCCP it did. At the gala
<Kencolt> One must admit, though-- in the area of pure unlimited random escapism, India has it down pat.
<otakon> Meanwhile: he's like the Iron Giant
<Phase4> how can that happen
<BaconBaconBaconBacon> Meanwhile BACON! >:(
<CuddlyKittens11> OH GOD, MLP NEEDS A BOLLYWOOD-ISH MUSIC NUMBER!
<CCCP> Mutterguy: LOL

<Tigereye> the cop is stuip since he doesn't realize who he is with
<unfoundbug> we just need to seed enough interest
<flutter_spin> Is it too late to start freaking out?
<K_A> SaxyPretender: I was about to say, David Nagle should totally write a Bollywood-style number.
<Cabrony> season 2 finale must be a 22 musical episode
<JarlCelestia> 0,5come touch me? O___o
<otakon> Meanwhile: no, but it was METAL which is FAMOUSLY known for NOT talking and moving on it's own accord
<[wub]Nidalee> yes Cabrony, yes.
<RanDT1-stallion> Now they ALL stretch with desire ;)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh man, imagin

<Djambi> ugghhh
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the dance numbers
*BaconBaconBaconBacon gags Meanwhile with bacon
<Midnight_Fire> We must send mass emails to Daniel Ingram demanding that he write a Bollywood style song
<homage> I do that sometimes
<pony_2312> Just embrace the madness:)
<RanYakumo> K_A Yeah. It also makes Bollywood movies very refreshing in a way. Sure, the stories are very similar to each other, but Bollywood in general has a very refreshing optimism and happiness throughout their films.
<flutter_spin> sub? wheres the sub?
<StinkomanFan> Bacon no!
<Sumica> 00,10So much yes saxy
<Cabrony> Rarity can stretch like a marshmallow
<Thetrollside> Was anyone else worried when they said S3 would be 13 episodes?
<otakon> BaconBaconBaconBacon: dpt
<otakon> don't go bad!
<MrMaxaminus> I'm actually enjoying this number.
<RanYakumo> Also, in terms of pure movie interupting destruction, this is nothing compared to Indian Terminator.
<Meanwhile> otakon: he was a robot, which are known for moving of their own accord.
<Randomnerd> Nice!
<CCCP> Midnight_Fire: i wil do that
<otakon> bc of Meanwhile
<durger> bollywood mlp episode with Spike as the lease
<TheMaster> bollywood?
<Mutterguy> Midnight_Fire no, an entire episode
<StinkomanFan> See what you did meanwhile?
<durger> lead*
<Kencolt> MLP ALREADY has random musical Numbers. I don't think we need Twilight Sparkle in a sari suddejnly singing and dancing with some colt we never saw before. Especially dancing.
<Randomnerd> This is awesome.
<otakon> Meanwhile: not in the 50's they weren't
<richfiles> My mouth... It has stretched with the desire to laugh... hard :D

<Mutterguy> in fact lets make the opening 2 parter of season 4 a bollywood style musical
<Princess_Luna> Hello, tis your filly princess-what am I watching now...
<Randomnerd> This movie's only real problem is the length.
<otakon> BaconBaconBaconBacon: no! don't turn to the dark side!

<Thetrollside> Luna!Save us!
<K_A> Indian dresses are colorful and elaborate, not Twilight's style.
<StinkomanFan> BaconBaconBaconBacon you may want to sit out for a while, Me and Otakon will try to handle him
<K_A> Now, Rarity on the other hand.
<otakon> RAWRity: LOL!
<Kencolt> Well... Partly, Sumica. And partly because, as much as I llike Twilight-- THE FILLY CAN'T DANCE.
<Princess_Luna> Save who from what?
<homage> yes.
<flutter_spin> uh

<pony_2312> Twilight can be feminine
<otakon> hmmmm
<Cabrony> superbronies are already making their own flash pony parodies
<Kencolt> On the other hoof... she might look good in a sari...
<StinkomanFan> Otakon, he's right. This is his fight
<richfiles> :) Twilight is a fine pony, and her dancing is adorkably discordantly wonderful! :$
<otakon> fine
<CCCP> night MasterBrony
<otakon> and hiya emangamer
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...okay, I imagined twilight in a sari
<Nero> twilight is best pony
<RAWRity> bollywood movies, by their very nature, are the kind of thing you have to know what you're getting into. If you don't prep yourself for 3 hours of genre hopping cheesiness, you won't enjoy yourself.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it is an AMAZING sight
<Meanwhile> This'd be easier to play of as my nature if I could control the tone of words.
<Djambi> what
<Thetrollside> Fine luna, if you wont i will just have to take care of this myself D:<
<d3rb> dawwww, yes you can have hugs fluttershy
<CriticKitten> It is.
<CriticKitten> We need Twilight in a sari now. :D
<pony_2312> It would be cool

<otakon> RAWRity: I don't enjoy cheesyness, it hurts me physically
<RanYakumo> CuddlyKittens11 If there's any Indian Dancing, they totally need to introduce a new "race" of creatures. Do it with Indian Elephants! :D
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: I think it's great, but the lenght is killing me.
<TheMaster> Indians have good taste
<Nero> i guess im going to sleep

<CCCP> I hope this ends soon
<fluttercry> 05,15....in the regulars room
<LulzSec> CriticKitten:*insert Rarity whining rant here*
<pony_2312> Someone spiked my drink
<otakon> WE NEED AN INTERMISSION
<[wub]Nidalee> And?
<CriticKitten> If you can't enjoy it when it's clearly not a bad movie, then go do something else instead of whine. We've watched stuff *I* didn't like and I didn't waste time whining about it. :p
<durger> they should hand out balloons at all bars!
<RanYakumo> This movie's been running pretty long, hasn't it?
<BlueDWarrior> So what are we watching right now anyway?
<flutter_spin> Better watch it. He may start speaking English being so drunk like that.
<Midnight_Fire> It is almost 3/4 over
<Ponybrine> How much longer we got
<otakon> fluttercry: this is the only room Bacon was in
<RanYakumo> Considering it's Bollywood, I shouldn't be surprised if it's really long.
<otakon> and where did he go?
<Tigereye> whoes winnning
<Cabrony> this is way better than epic movie
<Thetrollside> If im ever chosen, im picking back to the barnyard....
<CCCP> CriticKitten: no i like it kind of but its really really long
<Midnight_Fire> All bollywood movies are long
<Meanwhile> This must be how dari feels when people call his movie opinions trolling. Must be an English thing.
<Djambi> waaaaait for it
<pony_2312> True
<genericblue> hello everypony

<LulzSec> Why do they have to be long?!
<otakon> man
<Midnight_Fire> I've only seen one that's under 2 hours

<StinkomanFan> You started an arguement with a user!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14is the Lin-sanity over, RanYakumo
<Ponybrine> this movie is toooo loooong. why are there so many indiaaans?
<otakon> How does Luna LIKE this stuff?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14?
<RanYakumo> Mightnight_Fire Yeah, pretty much.
<TheMaster> because indians like long movies?
<Hazard3> sup!
<Tigereye> I agree pnybrine
<CriticKitten> Linsanity is never over.
<pony_2312> Awwwww
<RAWRity> I guess the british are just really shit at sarcasm.
<Cabrony> Lin to Win
<CriticKitten> Not so long as there are puns left in the world.
<Hazard3> what the fuck is this?!
<Darf14> I guess they prefer quantity over quality
<genericblue> what movie is this?
<Meanwhile> Try really good
<TheMaster> I prefer Linsanity over tebowmania atleast
<RanYakumo> SaxyPretender I don't think one defeat is enough to end Linsanity.
<Randomnerd> otakon: I think she's trollin'
<Mutterguy> Ponybrine: Bollywood
<SaxyPretender> 0,14see, as a New Yorker who DOESN'T watch sports
<RanYakumo> Maybe a string of 3-4 in a row.
<Kencolt> The thing is.... since most Bollywood is pure escapism, for the masses (Al la Depression America, which did a lot of the same things) the musicals numbers do happen at random. The American equivalent was the musical, where instead of being random, they were a constant, even the whole focus of the picture.
<Midnight_Fire> Bunty Aur Babli
<flutter_spin> lol
<Sumica> 00,10suddnly
<CriticKitten> Dashrath? He's a Dash fan clearly
<RanDT1-stallion> DUNDUNDUN!!!!
<Princess_Luna> I'm a filly and I don't even know what is wrong with this movie, but it is somewhat creepy somehow...would somepony care to brush me please...?
<RAWRity> if nobody gets your sarcasm, you're doing it wrong.
<Vinyl> What a twist~
<otakon> wait
<richfiles> They had to pay people to clear out, so they could reduce the muber of indians on screen at a time! :D
<Djambi> lol

<[wub]Nidalee> the voice
<flutter_spin> so many balloons
<otakon> my god
<RanYakumo> TheMaster As I've said before, since Indian movies are basically an escape for the lower class, you want to make them pretty long.
<Darf14> needs more balloons
<otakon> he's a COP?
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: it's rather hard to do sarcasm in text without ending a sentence with /sarcasm.
<Mutterguy> Mission impossble
<Ponybrine> i like baloons
<otakon> yh
<CCCP> small cars
<Meanwhile> Besides, most of what I said wasn't sarcastic.
*Tovler shakes his head at the people defending this movie from xenophobic uncultured swine.
<Cabrony> "ballons are super easy to pack" - pinkie pie
<RanYakumo> Did he just drive off in a golf cart?

<Kencolt> Heart shaped ballons-- you sure no pony is around? (Looking at YOU,. Pinkie!)
<RAWRity> No, Luna genuinely enjoys this, and I can understand why. It's an acquired taste, but if you're open to it, it can be a ton of fun.

<pony_2312> But they have millions!!!
<Princess_Luna> Thank you a;; amd hello.
<PD2525> hi
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: That's precisely why Americans need to watch it. They need to get some culture and learn to try other things from other places and people. Bollywood is a fantastic variation on film, song, and dance culture, so it's worth viewing.
*Thetrollside Plans the assasination of Fillyfillyy....
<Roxsnow> oh hello Princess_Luna : o
<KwakLad> Good night y'all
<unfoundbug> ooh its Princess_Luna
<Randomnerd> It's the length. The songs are freaking catchy.

<otakon> argh
<otakon> not for me
<Roxsnow> gppf mohjy LwakLad : 3
<richfiles> Luna is best pony
<RAWRity> otakon: there's "not enjoying it" and then there's "acting live everyone who is enjoying it is insane or trolling." essentially, you've become that kid in the red jacket from Teens React To Bronies.
<otakon> I don't know why
*fillyfillyy uses his other hoof to rub Princess_Luna's back the way she likes
<pony_2312> How did they burn so much money so quickly?
<RanYakumo> CriticKitten Speaking of getting some cultures from films and whatnot, Nigeria's film industry is starting to boom as well.
<mario_pony> Princess_Luna: you do what is it?
<PD2525> with fire
<owlicious> A party
*Mutterguy checks his apple pies are fresh and ready to fling
<RanYakumo> Saddly, I haven't seen any Nigerian films yet.

<tgl1992> Alright, I want ponies really bad right now :3
<Princess_Luna> Wow that was a bit much TechRat, hello...thank you all and slow down for a second...
<Darf14> Easy, they have help from the joker to burn all the money
<otakon> RAWRity: dear god NO! I don't want to be that guy!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Nollywood? I haven't heard any good things about them to be honest.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ouch
<Meanwhile> Harsh. But accurate.
*Thetrollside Shoots a dart in fillyfillyy's neck filled with a knockout poison
<Ponybrine> its india they spent it on cheap labor
<TechRat> :)
<PD2525> Now imagine this... acted by ponies
<owlicious> How will they burn all that gold
<flutter_spin> lol
<otakon> I REALLY don't want to be that guy, HOW DO I STOP IT!
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: In otakon's definse, I suggested Luna was trolling, not he.
*fillyfillyy is wearing royal armour
<Tigereye> Is this the end of the movie?
<CriticKitten> Aye, and honestly the more experience you get with other cultural films, the better. You'll be able to enjoy things in a whole new light.
<PD2525> HE JUST FLIPED US OFF!
<Meanwhile> Luna probably is trolling,.
<fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity that kid was an asshat
<RanYakumo> DerpDERPDERPDERP From what I've read, the production costs are pretty low so far. But hey, you've got to start out somewhere.
*Mutterguy tosses the pie at Thetrollside
<Princess_Luna> Do you like the armour fillyfillyy?
<Darf14> He got dressed in 10 seconds flat
<Meanwhile> Since Luna isn't even here.
<otakon> I just don't get the appeal of this is all
<DwarvenLawnchair> Can you even move in that, fillyfillyy ?
*fillyfillyy has Thetrollside taken away to the dungean for assasination attempt

*Tovler now picks Fiddler on the Roof for A movie.
<Ponybrine> i want that uniform
<DwarvenLawnchair> You are so tiny. Is funny to me.
<mario_pony> Princess_Luna: what is the name of your website?
<RAWRity> otakon: simple. Stop bring others into it. YOu have a problem with the film? say it. But don't assume that because you aren't getting anything out of it that others can't.
<RanYakumo> Just because of the pure mass of Nollywood filmmakers, one or two of them is bound to get some major hits.
*Thetrollside Launches rocks at fillyfillyy
<MrMaxaminus> Prediction. He's gonna catch them, and then he's gonna let them go.
<richfiles> Mission Impossibru This neck will crack in 3 seconds
<pony_2312> Superman would be proud
<Kencolt> Why is it everyone assumes that Americans don't have their own culture? We do, you know. It's kind of random, I admit.. we define multicultural. It''s also why we're willing to watch nearly anything.
<unfoundbug> uh oh
<RanYakumo> Robber fail
<Randomnerd> Is fiddler also 3 hours? @_@
<Princess_Luna> Lunar Cabinet. But if you search it straight up you might not find it.

<Princess_Luna> Yakumo...is this the one I know or...
<Meanwhile> You ever seen a grown Indian Stallone naked?
<RanYakumo> TheMaster That was a great film.
<fillyfillyy> Princess_Luna: Yes the armour is very nice
<MrMaxaminus> We have. Um. Marlboros, and...Coke, and...Blue Jeans

<d3rb> oh hai applejack
<fillyfillyy|17hours> WTH is a pone Ponybrine??
<Kencolt> Major establishment-- Ponies do pee.
<Tovler> Hasbro took down Last Roundup.
<RAWRity> but yeah, that's a pretty neat little detail from the animators.
<Djambi> *FART*
<homage> NO
<richfiles> Apple may not even be KEEPING the episodes if ordered taken down, which suggests that even if hasbro says the episode cxan go back up, unless they resubmit, Apple MIGHT not even HAVE the episodes to put back up.
<otakon> Kencolt: and have outhouses
<owlicious> Why? do they hate applejack?
<d3rb> whos going to buy the dvd?
<Cabrony> dang i missed the derpy moment :P
<flutter_spin> O.o
<Golakka> I
<Night_Fire> Hasbro is dildos.
<Ponybrine> typing in the dark is hard
<emangamer> I dont like the way they have been treating pinkie in the more newer episodes
<Night_Fire> ^
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Brothel Pony
<durger> Last Roundup is on the Friendship Express DVD. Nothing to worry about
<otakon> Cabrony: you have NO idea
<jffry890> pinkie doesnt give 2 f*** about AJ
<RAWRity> what do you mean?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> indeed it is, yet some of those ponies where in the rodea too
<Djambi> prostitute-in-cheif
<jffry890> you got any snacks?
<Sumica> 00,10Good thing i got the ep before the shitstorm then
<owlicious> ..
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> rodeo*
<somberguy> no the soccer moms called derpy retarded and got the episode removed
<otakon> Sumica: me too
<flutter_spin> so many inuendos
<mario_pony> cherry changa
<Jaketehsnake> :I love when we first saw this and thought she was a prostitiute
<RainbowcrashNBurn> is it wrong that i find pinkie promise more memorable from this ep than derpy?
<tgl1992> chimicherry
<Tovler> It's the Janet Jackson thing all over again when only 90 people were actually offended.
<tgl1992> or cherrychang
<richfiles> Which gets back to Hasbro... If they SAY to put the episodes back up... it won't happen. They probably need to resubmit, as if they were new episodes.
<Djambi> she's a "working girl"
<Cabrony> she is more like a madam
<otakon> RainbowcrashNBurn: hell no
<Jaketehsnake> tovler, everyone else just like the boobs :$
<flutter_spin> AJ
<RanDT1-stallion> Yes Ditch ur friends AND your apples -___- cutie mark says it all
<jffry890> lol flanks...
<RAWRity> and then another ded chat.
<somberguy> applejack is a hypocrite element of honesty my ass
<RAWRity> this chat is full of corpses

<Ponybrine> BEANS!?!?!
<emangamer> I mean they have mader her legitamitely crazy. With the cherry scene and her mouth going like that, pinkie's neck in daring doo, and several other times. I prefer he to just be really really silly
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> See you all later!

<[wub]Nidalee> I heard katrina is getting implants because shes jelous
<tgl1992> inb4 I Love Lucy

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> theres a fanfic out there where Applejack actually thought Cherry Jubilee ran a house of Ill Repute
<Tovler> I've here podcast nightmares about how horrible iTunes is
<otakon> THEY AREN'T HIPPOCRITS
<[wub]Nidalee> its quite the news here in runeterra
<d3rb> their imperfections make then awesome
<homage> yellow cherries?
<flutter_spin> mmm yellow cherries
<otakon> good LORD
<Ponybrine> hey they look familliar
<Djambi> Pinkie needs to shut her mouth and never open it again.
<ExAxis> I switch to a different tab for 30 seconds and this scene already comes up
<K_A> This is an excellent ep, but this scene is relatively overrated.
<somberguy> oh i love this I love lucy pony style
<Jaketehsnake> LAWDY
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Yes there are Yellow Cherries IRL
<otakon> they are NOT perfect
<Ponybrine> sounds delicious
<jffry890> that factory is not very efficient
<Kencolt> Yes. There rea yellow cherries.
<GRAVEDIGGERity> well, she's always been rather stretchy physically
<Orggrek> Applejacks not lying per say, shes just not telling anyone about anything.
<fillyfillyy|17hours> OMG i just checked itunes...why did they take down this ep?? :(
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> dat freez
<richfiles> Apple's email said that the request initially came from Hasbro, but they can't do anything unless Hasbro takes the steps to fix it... but DON'T count that against Hasbro. I'm blaming the iTunes media submission system.
<otakon> yeah
<K_A> Well, it would be if it weren't for Derpy, actually. XD
<Djambi> boink
<jffry890> they should put 1 color at the end of the conveyor and push the other color in the box
<otakon> remember her wig out in "Feeling Pinkie Keen"?
<emangamer> but I mean thats a bit of a stretch in my eyes
<Jaketehsnake> sexyface

<homage> inb4 great depression.
<somberguy> speed it up a little
<Djambi> lol dash
<RanDT1-stallion> yay for one word responces
<richfiles> When Apple removes a show from iTunes, they more or less DELETE it from the servers. Hasbro may not KNOW this.
<otakon> yh, Pinkie is played for a LOT of physical gags
<durger> oh n/m
