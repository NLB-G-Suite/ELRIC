<TopHat> why is it that I've never seen a fic about zecora?
<emangamer> TopHat: because she isn't a pony

<IngloriousPony89> She's still a character. I guess she's jusst not that popular.
<emangamer> TopHat: but they are the best ponies

<emangamer> night mario_pony
<Shizuka> 13i suppose everypony would be portaled out after this... wish i could draw so i could play my mix...
<emangamer> is there such a thing as "portled" out?
<Midnight_Tempest> ive been portalled out for a couple years...
<IngloriousPony89> I feel like the luckist guy in the world. I'm getting my gf to draw me a pony picture. It looks awesome so far :D
<MirrorImage> emangamer - depends if you can get that second portal outside the testing complex
<Shizuka> 13i mean... i can blast through it in under an hour..
<Shizuka> 131 that is, 2 is still a good six hour endeavour
<emangamer> Shizuka: I dont like the non-chamber part of portal two...they aren't as fun
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - well when you consider that 1 was just a very well fleshed out concept rather than a full game
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Sumica> 00,10Do what you want Shizuka it's your show after all
<GenesisIsMagic> Awsome! Portal 2, Damn i wish i had that game!
<kyle113> Hi Kimori1
<emangamer> yea what Sumica said
<Shizuka> 13maybe start with plasma pong... that would get everypony limbered up...
<emangamer> ^
<emangamer> lol plasma pong
<Shizuka> 13oh don't lol, you'll see
<emangamer> lol plasma pong
<Sumica> 00,10part of the problem is alot of the new co-op test pull heavly from the earlyer ones so if you have not done them in some time.
<Shizuka> 13that too
<emangamer> Shizuka: you must be a fast reader. Ever time I finish reading something you already have a response out
<IngloriousPony89> Wait. A snorkel? Why does P-Body have a snorkel??
<emangamer> because reasons
<IngloriousPony89> Does Portal 2 have hats?
<Sumica> 00,10cause they spent so much time diveing in to acid

<Everlasting_Joy> I remember reading an entire book in one day in sixth grade.
<emangamer> Shizuka: Yea, I've heard of that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Hmmm, my CMOA is probably finishing the last Harry Potter book in...5 hours?

<Midnight_Tempest> very nice Shizuka

<Shizuka> 13i have all three in paperback but ti'ana ran away and d'ni lost its back cover somehow
<Cypresswolf> Puts alot of history to the games

<Shizuka> 13see what i did there
<emangamer> I know people have been using it forever but I didn't know if it was proper
<GenesisIsMagic> Hey do you think mlp fim is better then portal 2 or portal 2 is much better then mlp fim
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<Shizuka> 13we don't always show ponies
<emangamer> Shizuka: http://images.icanhascheezburger.com/completestore/2009/4/15/128842884140461995.jpg
<Kimori1> hey
<Shizuka> 13there is such thing as too many ponies, we found that out at christmas
<IngloriousPony89> Game vs TV show? Invalid comparison.
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<Shizuka> 13type mismatch
<IngloriousPony89> Try again.
<emangamer> Shizuka: no such thing....the christmas stream was glorious
<Midnight_Tempest> compare when Portal becomes a TV show...
<kyle113> Sorry I got on so late...how did the game store thing go?
<emangamer> maybe not for mods, but for all other ponies it was very enjoyable
<GenesisIsMagic> I know and that's awsome! I love portal 2 it's a awsome game!
<Phase4> its up to those two rarity's :P
<Sumica> 00,10they had a portal tv show, it was called Cube
<emangamer> ^
<emangamer> oh my go Sumica that movie....
<Sumica> 00,10movies
<emangamer> oh wait... a movie is not a tv show...
<Kimori1> not what I hoped
<GenesisIsMagic> They should show some game play of SUPERMEATBOY!
<emangamer> GOD DAMN why am I stupid tonight?
<Kimori1> the manager wasnt able to give me the signs I wanted
<IngloriousPony89> How about this: MLP FiM vs Ed, Edd, and Eddy
<Sumica> 00,10we have had super meat boy lets plays
<Kimori1> but they gave me what they could
<Sumica> 00,10FiM over EE&E
<Kimori1> I got a box full of game display boxes and a few posters
*IngloriousPony89 slaps Sumica
<kyle113> Awe why couldnt they give you the signs?
<emangamer> RARITY??? since when are atlas and pbody rarity?
<Everlasting_Joy> emangamer since GLaDOS said apparently.
<IngloriousPony89> I love MLP, but my nostalgia glasses are WAY to strong. Ed, Edd, and Eddy is the best cartoon ever.
<Sumica> 00,10I did not like that show much
<GenesisIsMagic> Sumica: Cool! I wish you guys did that again!
<Kimori1> I guess its some sort of contract
<Shizuka> 13eene was built on slapstick... which did work most of the time, sound effects made it
<emangamer> ^
<Kimori1> I know that with their signs there are some that a company might want back
<emangamer> dat sextant...
<Shizuka> 13car horn for various impacts is just perfect
<Kimori1> nintendo might give them some signs but afterwards they might request them back
<Kimori1> its the same with other companies, I have no idea why but thats just how it goes
<kyle113> Oh I see. Well you made out pretty good though
<Kimori1> its the main reason why it costs so much money to buy them online
<emangamer> und then the chat was ded
<Sumica> 00,10it had it's moments but then again I saw most the jokes back when the three stooges did it
<Kimori1> besides the posters and boxes I also got a bunch of buttons that say DLC available
<Shizuka> 13mfw nittany looks straight at what he needs to shoot...
<GenesisIsMagic> Why dont you guys do a play through of mincraft!
<IngloriousPony89> I've never watched the three stooges is the thing. But I still think I would enjoy EEND more
<Kimori1> it was to promote games that let you download more stuff online
<emangamer> I have only seen a few episode of three stooges...they were margional at best (when I saw them)
<Sumica> 00,10we have done some MC play alongs as well
<Kimori1> ill post a picture of the stuff one of these days..
<emangamer> MTG DotP playthroughs?
<emangamer> /playalongs
<Shizuka> 13hm..
<emangamer> that wouldn't be very entertaining so...
<Shizuka> 13the puzzle mode is vaguely interesting
<Sumica> 00,10wrek has one hell of a city going on our server
<Midnight_Tempest|AFK> yeah... lets watch a cardgame... >_<
<emangamer> the puzzle mode is fun yes
<Shizuka> 13i think i still have some sets to do in planeswalkers..
<emangamer> Midnight_Tempest|AFK: it worked for yugioh
<Cypresswolf> Im walking on acid Whoa oh :P
<GenesisIsMagic> How about gameplay of sonic generations
<emangamer> Shizuka: PC I'm assuming
<Shizuka> 13jaja
<emangamer> GenesisIsMagic: NO
<emangamer> damn...I have it for xbox
<Kimori1> eventually ill get some console signs, just not at this time
<emangamer> the DLC is pretty entertaining as well
<emangamer> some good new decks
<Shizuka> 13but not magic 2012 either, i preordered the first duels of the planeswalkers... and then my game shop didn't have the free card when i went to redeem the coupon :<
<Midnight_Tempest|AFK> im gonna go shoot stuff for a bit... going AFK in chat...
<emangamer> GODDAMMITDARIBOT
<kyle113> Yeah
<IngloriousPony89> That reminds me. emangamer, did you send me a friend request on live a couple days ago?
<emangamer> IngloriousPony89: I doubt it
<emangamer> you would know if it was me
<emangamer> considering my name is eman gmaer
<emangamer> gamer*
<Suinide> Hmm
<Kimori1> yo
<IngloriousPony89> I got a random friend request and I have no idea who it is
<IngloriousPony89> Accepted it anyway :P
<Suinide> Hi
<GenesisIsMagic> emangamer:Damnit! What's the song playing in portal 2?
<emangamer> ask Sumica
<Everlasting_Joy> IngloriousPony89 why?
<CloudSabre> I got a request on steam and he told me that he saw RD as my profile pick and boom! friend request
<emangamer> althought I doubt he knows
<Kimori1> sup?
<Sumica> 00,10if only somthing on stream said what it was eh?
<Suinide> Got some skylanders finally
<emangamer> How is it i've neverr seen CloudSabre before
<Shizuka> 13that reminds me...
<IngloriousPony89> No idea why Everlasting_Joy. Will probably take him off if I clean out my friends list.
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<GenesisIsMagic> Sumica :What's the music playing in portal 2?
<emangamer> yes, <bats his eyelashes> shizuka?
<Kimori1> figures?
<Shizuka> 13some random from the tribes 2 forums (well... they've branched out now) started messaging me randomly cause he said he saw the bronystate tavern on dA
<Everlasting_Joy> I REALLY need to clean my friends list out. Too bad I'm a lazy fat*yay* to do it.
<Suinide> Yup
<Sumica> 00,10yay Shizuka?
<Kimori1> cool what kind?
<Shizuka> 13and i'm like... dude... round those forums i am the heartless monster who singlehandedly wrote every rule they live by, and i didn't even start the servers
<IngloriousPony89> You have like Everlasting?
<IngloriousPony89> live*
<Mutterguy> I thought arse is a permitted swear?
<Suinide> Double trouble, whirlwind, drill sergeant and mutha fuckin cynder
<emangamer> Shizuka is worst heartless monster, considering she is deeply compassionate
<Everlasting_Joy> IngloriousPony89 are you refering to me?
<Kimori1> ahh nice
<Kimori1> Ive got cynder
<IngloriousPony89> Eeyup
<Sumica> 00,10Shizuka heartless?
<Shizuka> 13i should totally link those rules sometime... shows what happens when i go into srsmode alone
<Kimori1> havent tried her yet though
<GenesisIsMagic> Have you guys ever seen happy tree friends?
<Darf14> sorry im not talking much, doing E T 182 HW
<IngloriousPony89> Of course Genesis. Who hasn't?
<Everlasting_Joy> IngloriousPony89 268.
<emangamer> I would hate to see a team of Shizuka srsmode ponies..
<IngloriousPony89> 268? That's your gamertag or...? Everlasting_Joy
<Sumica> 00,10I want to see a team of sea ponies
<Cypresswolf> Ive seen HTF, years ago though, they still making those?
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh no, I thought you were, and I was, refering to FB friends.
<Kimori1> you had a hard time finding cynder?
<Everlasting_Joy> It's late here, I'm tired.
<IngloriousPony89> What time is it where you live?
<Suinide> Actually ive had a hard time finding any :P quite a few times i looked i couldnt find any
<Suinide> I just like her a lot
*emangamer only has 11% untill portal is installed
<emangamer> I should probably stay up
<GenesisIsMagic> Of coarse it's has alway's been gory, The show is done in the same way of animation (Flash) like mlp fim
<Phase4> Sumica: Sea Ponies. Fsck Yeah.
<Sumica> 00,10yay he's geting it
<Suinide> Shes already level 10 and fully upgraded
<emangamer> Sumica: either that or shizu is telling him how to do it
<Everlasting_Joy> It's 2300 hrs, but I've been getting up early to do school work, and I've been burning myself out on school work as well.
<Kimori1> I had a hard time at first but after a week I saw maybe 10 of em at one store
<Mutterguy> Shoo Shoo be doo!
<Shizuka> 13he figured it out
<Kimori1> best time to stock up :P
<Everlasting_Joy> How I haven't snapped yet is beyond me.
<Shizuka> 13he is mad at me now for pointing out the down arrow :<
<emangamer> SUUURRREEEE he did
<Sumica> 00,10nah he got it before the mesage from Shizuka came through
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I got it just before Shizuka spoiled,.
<Phase4> Scheming jucies
<Shizuka> 13did not spoil :<
<Shizuka> 13just pointed out the bright arrow you kept missing :<
<emangamer> Shizuka: you know you're the most wubbed pony here right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is why I don't do well at games like BF3.
<Suinide> I bought all they had that i didnt :P
<IngloriousPony89> Maybe it was because you pointed the arrow out on his knee?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Slow thinker.
<Cypresswolf> I think the last HTF I saw was the video by...hmm...minds like a seive tonight. can't remember which band that was
<Kimori1> you mean you bought extras of each figure?
<Phase4> i just relised that Shizuka's colours look like cheerilee
<Sumica> 00,10just need to look at the set peices they plaster all ove the walls
<Suinide> No silly
<Suinide> I bought one of eaxh skylander i didnt have
<Kimori1> ohh
<Kimori1> thats what I was talking about >.>
<Sumica> 00,106,13 nah this is cheerilee
<emangamer> AH
<emangamer> MY EYES
<Everlasting_Joy> My eyes!
<Shizuka> 13portal 2 ist about identifying the three portalable surfaces und what the controls control, und then running the path
<Kimori1> I only did that for cynder though, she looks awesome
*Phase4 hugs Sumica
<GenesisIsMagic> The last latest HTF video I've seen was certian clause
<Phase4> i frikin LOVE cheerilee
<Phase4> best teacher ever
<Shizuka> 13i think after plasma pong i will not speedrun portal 1 but rather try to break everything <3
<Cypresswolf> I can read that, but not the rainbow text
<IngloriousPony89> I dont remeber the last HTF that I saw. They were at an amusement park. That's all I remeber
<Kimori1> also because a friend of mine couldnt find one
<TopHat> I frikin LOVE mac and cheese
<Mutterguy> meeeh, you two clearly haven't stared at the sun long enough
<Sumica> 00,1013,6 although this is less eye rape
<Suinide> She is awesome
<Phase4> mfw it dawns on me that the next episode will feature cheerilee
<Phase4> :3
<GenesisIsMagic> How here has played the Sega genesis/mega drive?
<emangamer> Shizuka: thats one think portal had over this one (untill the non test chamber part) was everything was portable so you didn't immediatly know where to go
<Kimori1> I figured she might be collectable in the future
<Suinide> They had regular chop chop to, but i already have legendary so neh i can wait
<Shizuka> 13still had set pieces though
<Phase4> your doing it wrong
<Cypresswolf> Flutterturrets
<Shizuka> 13the checkerboards that indicate fling targets for instance
<Sumica> 00,10I have the master system
<emangamer> inb4 shizu already knows all of the console commands
<Suinide> Idk, i mean they sell her like everyone else
<emangamer> yea but not nearly as many as in portal 2
<Kimori1> did you manage to find the legendary pack from toysrus?
<Suinide> I got that quite awhile ago
<Shizuka> 13no... in portal 2 the fling target is the only portalable surface in a sea of non-portalable
<GenesisIsMagic> I own a model 1 master system!
<Kimori1> thats awesome
<emangamer> Shizuka: instead of playing portal 1, play portal flash. that game is hard as hell
<Kimori1> super hard to find
<Suinide> You didnt get it?
<Kimori1> been trying to find it for a long time
<Sumica> 00,10so manny fizzled balls
<Kimori1> no
<Suinide> Lol they had a bunch when i went there
<Kimori1> if I could buy a case I would
<Shizuka> 13portal flash's difficulty is in execution
<Shizuka> 13because horrendous controls
<emangamer> its still hard
<Phase4> ^
<Kimori1> I'm probably not aggresive enough
<Phase4> i ment Shizuka 's coment
<Cypresswolf> :[turret: Your Going to LOVE ME *starts shooting*
<Suinide> Of course that was awhile ago
<Shizuka> 13the solutions are super obvious, it's just impossible to do them
<Phase4> which is probably going to happen in any 2d portal game
<Suinide> Maybe, since im driving so i can get my license ive been cheking them out more
<Kimori1> Ive never seen it since before thanksgiving
<emangamer> untill the last 5 puzzles...then there is actually some genuenly difficult puzzles
<Shizuka> 13what was it.... Epsilon i think? now that was a portal 2d done well
<Suinide> I havnt either i suppose, glad i got it when i did
<Kimori1> yeah
<emangamer> have you played mirrors edge?
<Phase4> ^
<Kimori1> I plan to buy the whole shelf if I see them
<Phase4> is good game
<Shizuka> 13played the demo
<emangamer> ^
*IngloriousPony89 never could be bothered to play the Portal flash games
<Suinide> Lol
<Phase4> needs ALOT of work but its a good game
<Shizuka> 13first person platforming
<emangamer> its an INCREDIBLE game
<Suinide> Me too
<Kimori1> damn thing is impossible to find
<emangamer> it doesnt worrent more than a rent though
<IngloriousPony89> And yes I've played the Mirrior's Edge.
<Suinide> I bet
<Sumica> 00,10I played the portal pilot game, with princess no knees
<Shizuka> 13screed does parkour well because third person und simple controls
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fun factL Mirror's Edge made me want to learn parkour
<IngloriousPony89> I agree with Yahtzee. A failed experiment.
<Shizuka> 13narbacular drop was fun
<GenesisIsMagic> Hey the next mlp fim episode (18) is called a friend in deed
<Phase4> Sumica: i couldnt get that to run properly
<Everlasting_Joy> Exterminate!
<Shizuka> 13tag the power of paint is fun too
<Suinide> I cant wait for the next two bonus adventure packs
<emangamer> its campaign is short and its only lasting appeal is the time trials...so if you buy it you're waisting money
<emangamer> I heard tag was fun
<Suinide> One of them has sparx :3
<Phase4> IngloriousPony89: i disagree about the failed part, but it does have problems
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Shizuka> 13tag is amazing
<Kimori1> oh?
*SaxyPretender got the full SCV OST today
<Suinide> Yup
<Kimori1> yeah that ones also going to be popular
<emangamer> you know what is REALLY fun for an FPS? Shadowrun is a really fun game with a new interesting concept I had never seen before
<Sumica> 00,10glad they got the gel idea from tag
<emangamer> granted its hard as hell but still its fun
<IngloriousPony89> Oh yeah Shadowrun. I suck so badly at that game.
<Shizuka> 13having the gel gun would have been so much more fun, but portal does go for the super simple
<emangamer> IngloriousPony89: everyone does...thats why it's fun
<Genericblue> awesome portal 2
<emangamer> difficulty in simplicity. thats what portal is
<Phase4> maby i'm biased about mirrors edge, i downloaded it (this was pre money, i can afford some games now), might have hated it if i paied its $110 retail price
<Genericblue> who is playing?
<Phase4> its a $30 game
<IngloriousPony89> I just rmember two of my friends having 1v1 matches and listening/watching to them fight and rage at eachother. Good times...
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - wait, $110?
<Phase4> GenesisIsMagic: Nittany_Discord
<Kencolt> I was always much more partial to the tabletop Shadowrun RPG, which came first. (I had an amazing Physad known as the Azure Kitten.)
<Shizuka> 13as much as i harsh on portal 2's easy difficulty, they did get the puzzling down to a... heh... science
<emangamer> Phase4: I torrented it. I almost got sued
<Darf14> I prefer the SNES version of Shadowrun
<Phase4> MirrorImage: that was what it cost here
<MirrorImage> australia?
<Phase4> emangamer: same, didnt get sued though
<Shizuka> 13take a limited set of pieces and scatter them in such a way that you figure out how they go together
<Phase4> MirrorImage: how'd you guess
<emangamer> Kencolt: yea I know, but I was told that the rules were like 100000 pages long though
<Suinide> Which is why im gonna buy as soon as i see
<Genericblue> oh this is the new content
<MirrorImage> that sounds like the kind of markup you aussie's get on video games
<Kimori1> one of these days ill find that legendary pack
<Suinide> Good luck baby
<Kencolt> Not that long-- b ut once you get the hang of it, it can be freaking amazingly fun.
<Sumica> 00,10oh good they finaly noticed the mirror cube port
<Phase4> yeah, steam probably has alot of aus gamers simply cause of that
<MirrorImage> at least not factoring in conversion between USD $ and whatever you use as a currency there
<Genericblue> i killed those turrets by picking up the ball and throwing it at them
<Suinide> Have you heard about the "sequal" yet?
<Kencolt> You will , however need more than a few dice-- but only sic-siders.
<Shizuka> 13this coop game needs about 400% more ping tool use
<Genericblue> i died in the process but it wa worth it
<emangamer> You know whats amazing? I've seen a blind man play LoZ OoT and beat a majority of the temples...that was an incredible sight to behold
<Shizuka> 13communication ist more than chat~
<Kencolt> Six-siders.
<Kimori1> yeah
<GenesisIsMagic> Who thinks genesis or snes is better
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so who's streaming/playing atm?
<Kimori1> saw it on the darkspyro website
<Suinide> Sounds sick
<Sumica> 00,10I take it neather one of them has mics
<IngloriousPony89> HAAAAAXXX emangamer
<Suinide> I want that giant hehe
<Kimori1> you think so? it doesnt look real appealing to me just yet
<Everlasting_Joy> SNES is better GenesisIsMagic.
<Shizuka> 13nittany und simon are playing, sumica is restreaming nittany
<emangamer> IngloriousPony89: nope, truefactz
<Suinide> Why not?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah, gotcha
<IngloriousPony89> Nope, Chuck Testa emangamer
<IngloriousPony89> And HAAAAXXX
<Kimori1> unless it has some spyro stuff involved I might pass on it
<Shizuka> 13i think nittany has a mic, just isn't using it
<emangamer> seriously that guy was really good for a blind guy
<Suinide> I was thinking about that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, that wonderful feeling when I can run to class with Ezio's SCV theme in my headphones
<IngloriousPony89> Did he beat the water temple eman?
<Suinide> So i guess i will wait to find that out
<GenesisIsMagic> Everlasting_Joy:Your hell right!
<Kimori1> yeah pretty much
<Kimori1> going to be a bit idly now, watching tv
<TopHat> I come from a land down under
<TopHat> Where beer does flow and men chunder
<Everlasting_Joy> GenesisIsMagic :)
<Suinide> Alrighty
<TopHat> Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
<emangamer> IngloriousPony89: he got to the part with the stream and the water pits and said "I havent figured out the pattern for this room yet, so if anyone wants to help me send me a message"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14You better run
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you better take cover
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*flute*

<Everlasting_Joy> Night emangamer!
<Vinco> Vegemite. Ew.
<IngloriousPony89> Needs more meat
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I want to try vegemite
<SaxyPretender> 0,14just to know what it is
<GenesisIsMagic> Who thinks the newer south park episode are better then the older south park episodes?
<emangamer> Shizuka: remember, you're never an imposter and everypony will wub woo forever, no matter what.
<Everlasting_Joy> I think I'll go too folks. I need to get up early enough. Ugh. . .
<emangamer> there is a reason you get so much wub you know?
*PartyCannon remembers this level
<Vinco> It's disgusting, that's what it is.
<IngloriousPony89> Night to you too Everlasting
<Sumica> 00,10I think I use somthing with that name as a non stick spray Shizuka
<Ingwaz> wub wub wub
<Shizuka> 13pam?

<Sumica> 00,10or was it vegi clean
*emangamer leaves for bed
<Shizuka> 13i wish i could stream the Best of K102 Morning Show CD i have but like NONE of you would get it...
<emangamer> i'm tied regardless of it being so early
*IngloriousPony89 brohoofs emangamer before he goes to bed /)
<Sumica> 00,10Nittany_Discord ingnore the ball get the mirror cube
<emangamer> /]
<Shizuka> 13cuuuuuuube
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What mirror cube.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I hate paperwork
<Shizuka> 13up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nvm.
<emangamer> cube was a generally entertaining movie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and running around to do said paperwork
<Phase4> [\
<emangamer> It should be our b movie one week
<Shizuka> 13where ist the spectator ping tool...
<Sumica> 00,10ikr
<Phase4> i saw an unclosed brohoof, that could not be allowd to pass
<Sumica> 00,10look up
<Sumica> 00,10far side of room
<Sumica> 00,10little teal lights indcate things you should look at
<Kencolt> I miss my tabletop RPG days... Feng Shui was a favorite. Over-the-top Hong-Kong action flick game with wierd magic... the ONLY game I have ever seen with a target number for riding on the back of a nuclear missile and defusing the warhead-- and it was achievable.
<GenesisIsMagic> What's the A and B this week, Air plane and top secret?
<Phase4> yu
<IngloriousPony89> <3 Airplane
<Phase4> ypu
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep
<Phase4> yup'
<Shizuka> 13aaaaairplane
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I can't wait for those movies
<Shizuka> 13will be a good night
<Phase4> i misspelt 'yup' twice
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I've seen Airplane quite a bit
<Shizuka> 13i haven't seen airplane in ages
<SaxyPretender> 0,14never seen Top Scecret, but I've hear of it
<Phase4> oh look, a button
<IngloriousPony89> The spelling error has been doubled!
<Sumica> 00,10use the funnle and the lazor
<Phase4> can you do that? can you misspell twice?
<GenesisIsMagic> Witch movie is better air plane or top secret?
<Kencolt> Well, of course you have. Airplane is a classic of the WTF genre of films.
<Sumica> 00,10lazor swaps funnle direction
<Shizuka> 13airplane i think would normally be a B, but it's such a GOOD B
<Phase4> dafaq is that sound? its like scratching, happens every 10-20 minutes and seems
<IngloriousPony89> Yes, you can misspell twice. I've even does it 4 times.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eeeyup, Shizuka
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Airplane used to be my A pick
<IngloriousPony89> I was a bit surprised to see it as an A movie. But I'm still happy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14until I decided we need more westerns in here
<Kencolt> Airplane is the better, IMHOP-- Top Secret is funny, but Airplane is a classic of gonzo comedy.
<Shizuka> 13i'm shooting for hitchhiker's guide und office space this week
<Sumica> 00,10clue all the way
<Shizuka> 13because mfw we haven't seen office space :<
<GenesisIsMagic> **Just exit chat room to bed**
*SaxyPretender gives Shizuka a red stapler.
<Phase4> i was suprised to see titan ae accepted as an a, dont think they care that much about the definition of a vs b
<Phase4> its not like it matters that much anyway
<SlurryMoon> 3Night ponies! I'll be heading out now
<Kimori1> now?
<IngloriousPony89> Entertaining movies are entertaining. That's all that matters
<Phase4> ohai SlurryMoon
<Phase4> night SlurryMoon
<Randomnerd> bye, SlurryMoon
<Kimori1> ill play the game eventually :P
<SlurryMoon> 3See you bright and early in the morning
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later SlurryMoon
<IngloriousPony89> Obai SlurryMoon
*Randomnerd dreams of doughnuts
<IngloriousPony89> Why not muffins? Or bacon?
<Sumica> 00,10portal the one game where the signs on the wall are important
<Shizuka> 13it's funny how in the portal 1 commentary they say how hard it is to get players to look up
<Phase4> ^
<Sumica> 00,10swap rolls guys
<Shizuka> 13and i go through games almost always looking up cause that's where the cool stuff is
<Phase4> the valve comentaries are very good
<Randomnerd> I'm not a pony, IngloriousPony89
<Shizuka> 13well... except left 4 dead... usually aiming towards the ground there cause there's less chance for friendly fire
<IngloriousPony89> Still, bacon Randomnerd
<Randomnerd> nom nom nom
<Phase4> weeee!
<Phase4> loop
<IngloriousPony89> L4D2 commentary was just ok
<IngloriousPony89> I think anyway
<Phase4> portal commentary's are worth a listen
<Phase4> at least you got the button
<IngloriousPony89> I wish you could save your game while in commentary mode in Portal 2
<Phase4> ^
<Phase4> mine crashed about 3/4 the way through
<Sumica> 00,10load chapters in comentary mode
<Shizuka> 13^ closest you get
<Phase4> i know but still
<Sumica> 00,10one of you work the lazor the othere work the funnle
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Trying to do that.
<IngloriousPony89> Not an easy room
<Shizuka> 13once you know how it works...
<Suinide> Lol
<Phase4> oh, i just figured it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We need to get someone into the funnel.
<Suinide> Sheeees so awesome though
<Phase4> easy, want to know how?
<Sumica> 00,10the lazor operatore gets the funnel rider in to the funnle
<GabeMoist> Ohai
<Phase4> ohai GabeMoist
<IngloriousPony89> Hai GabeN
<Sumica> 00,10funnel rider puts one by the mirror cube dispencer and in the funnle's path
<IngloriousPony89> Or GabeM I should say
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I need a mic.
<Phase4> theres bump mapping on the portal gun
<Phase4> WHY is there bump mapping on the portal gun
<Shizuka> 13normalmap ALL the things!
<Shizuka> 13it's the valve way!
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<Phase4> is it bump or normal? i think both could produce that effect
<Light_Latias> 12night all
<Sumica> 00,10ok use the lazor now
<Shizuka> 13i think it's interchangeable
*Light_Latias pushes a cliff off a cliff
<Shizuka> 13bump map is what we'd call it but i think it's specifically normal map
<Shizuka> 13something about light bouncing off a surface normal or some 3D jargon like that
<Sumica> 00,10......
<Simon2> got it
<Shizuka> 13compared to specular map which makes things shiny
<Sumica> 00,10save for the part where nitt did not use the lazor
<IngloriousPony89> Ok I'm going to bed. See everypony later!
<Shizuka> 13then there's also parallax map which is like bump map +2
<Shizuka> 13takes flat surface und gives it sharp depth that makes it look like it's modeled
<Phase4> just did a google, bump maps and normal maps are about the same thing achived differently
<Shizuka> 13saw that coming
<otakon> hemoth2012
<Phase4> normal maps and bump maps are used instead of the normal geometry when you do lighting
<otakon> damn typo
<Kimori1> what kind of attacks does she have?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...so...cold
<Phase4> that gun has like 5 quads that we can see
<otakon> hiya SaxyPretender
<Phase4> but LOOKS like it has more
<otakon> use blanket
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai otakon

<Polydunami> Wait, this is kind of akin to Katamar Damacy

<SuperBrony64> 10,020.00097579 N * (0.224808943 lbs / 1 N) = 0.00021937 lbs
<GLaDOS> Hehehe...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Therefore, that water droplet weighs 0.00021937 lbs.
<MahBoi777> you's all crazy, lol
<Placebo> Isn't that the force it applies at it's maximum velocity from falling?
<Placebo> You know what? I don't care anymore. Go do your homework.

*SuperBrony64 glomps Kipkat07
<Espeon|School> 06the sarcasm is of course mandatory
<Polydunami> Take care
*SuperBrony64 glomps Polydunami
<MahBoi777> why did I try to close that ad...:S
<Armageddon> Leo's pretty warm to the people he cares about
*SuperBrony64 glomps MahBoi777
*Polydunami incites pony pile
<Placebo> Dem Glomps.
<Drake> 04Everyone in this is going to be sarcastic
<Armageddon> I suppose Rhy, Nathan and Leo would grow to care for each other
*SuperBrony64 glomps Placebo
*MahBoi777 is glomped
<Placebo> O U
<Armageddon> lmfao true
<Placebo> U SO GLOMPY
<Simon2> U SO SILLY
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<Placebo> Pftchtcht
<Armageddon> you haven't seen me being sarcastic IRL
*SuperBrony64 glomps Simon2
<Drake> 04Yeah. Going through the beginning of WW3 and being a catalyst of it's beginning would be pretty stressful
*Simon2 sillies SuperBrony64
<Polydunami> I'm... H A P P Y
<Drake> 04I sorta kinda have
<MahBoi777> such silliness xD
<Armageddon> not to mention we'll be killing people
<Drake> 04But not to the extent you usually are
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Drake> 04I don't want it to be "Bang bang hey cool headshot"
*Placebo takes all the sillyness, and pushes it somewwhere else
<Drake> 04Killing people is gonna be pretty traumatic
<Armageddon> well
<Polydunami> It's still somewhere :3
<MahBoi777> that's crazy, you can't handle all that silliness
<Armageddon> Rhy is still pretty much a cold heartless jerk/bastard/bitch
<Espeon|School> 06I like the sound of that.
<Placebo> Forget you, I can handle all this pftchtHAHAlol
<Drake> 04XD
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You’ve got to be kidding me. I’ve been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It’s
<SuperBrony64> 10,2just common sense
<Placebo> What is that from?
<Armageddon> and yeah Drake
<Simon2> dat common sense
<Espeon|School> 06Actually make even the enemy not just cannon fodder and make things more terrifying in general
<Placebo> You've got it copied/pasted from somewhere..
<Armageddon> yep
<Drake> 04Yeah
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Know Your Meme
<Espeon|School> 06so it's not cawadooty: the fiction
<MahBoi777> I understand it all
*Placebo doesn't know that meme
<Drake> 04I hate it when mooks die by the hundreds in shooter stories
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Drake> 04And stealth will be important
<Armageddon> shooting makes me puke
<Armageddon> and on another note
<Kipkat07> i love that site
<Armageddon> Rhy hates guns, shooting and everything related
<Armageddon> except for flying
<Shizuka> 13finally..
<Placebo> http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/has-anyone-really-been-far-even-as-decided-to-use-even-go-want-to-do-look-more-like
<Evdog> My favourite song at the moment has a dubstep version http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s4n76ti3Xs
<Armageddon> Rhy loves flying planes/jets/etc.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So ur with ur honey and yur making out wen the phone rigns. U anser it n the vioce is “wut r u doing wit my daughter?” U tell ur girl n she say “my dad is ded”. THEN WHO WAS PHONE?
<Drake> 04She'll be using guns of course, but she'll prefer not to.
<Kipkat07> that is were i lerned tonz of brony stuffz
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> she'll hate it
<Drake> 04Also no heavy weapons likes rocket launchers. We'll use them through the story, but it's not like they'd be your trademark weapon.
<Polydunami> Know your meme?
<Armageddon> fuck o
<Armageddon> no
<Polydunami> You mean?
<Kipkat07> wat tiem is it
<Armageddon> Rhy's primary weapon is a laser sword/saber
<Kipkat07> yes
<Drake> 04No
<Drake> 04no laser swords
<Drake> 04no giant katanas
<Drake> 04no swords
<Drake> 04Realism
<Drake> 04Daggers or something like that, sure
<Armageddon> future
<Drake> 04Kunai
<Drake> 04w/e
<Drake> 04but no laser stuff
<Armageddon> we discussed this
<MahBoi777> I have diabeetus, it hurts when I pee, and make me short with my wife. Last night I hit her, come to find out, my wife has been dead for 8 years.....who the hell did I hit??
<Placebo> SuperBrony64: Her mother.
<Drake> 04NS this isn't the year 3000
<Armageddon> it's 2069
<Drake> 04It's like, 2060 or something. We couldn't have advanced that far
<Espeon|School> 06..
<Espeon|School> 06oh
<Espeon|School> 06dear
<Armageddon> 2069
<Armageddon> WE DISCUSSED THIS
<Placebo> Bed time.
<Drake> 04AND I AM VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED TO LASERS OF ANY KIND
<Placebo> or not.
<Placebo> Damn you, ponies.
<Armageddon> :|
<Armageddon> let me show you my logs
<Kipkat07> 3:55 am CT
<MahBoi777> gnight Placebo
<Simon> iTunes is finally resolved
<Drake> 04I don't think that will change my mind.
<Armageddon> we discussed this
<Drake> 04Because if we bring lasers in then it'll become too fantastic
<Espeon|School> 06Well Leo should have a rifle, pretty much. Perhaps with a makeshift scope. Better than the insanity in those old rp approval threads :U
<Placebo> what was wrong with it?
<Espeon|School> 06some of it is true what the christ material
<Simon2> episode 17
<Drake> 04XD
<MahBoi777> he's makin a strawberrychunga...
<Placebo> Oh. right
<Placebo> http://www.ebay.com/itm/250991976284?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649

<Polydunami> Oh my
<Simon2> I fon't have the e-cash ;A;
<MahBoi777> aww
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:07:56 <Drake> and plasma is overused.
<Drake> 04Nathan will probably use some sort of bolt action sniper rifle with 8x-10x zoom, and another rifle with 4x zoom for close quarters operations
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:07:56 <~Armageddon> well then
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:07:59 <~Armageddon> I like plasma
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:08:08 <~Armageddon> I want a fucking plasma sword/blade
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:08:18 <~Armageddon> like a damn lightsaber hurr durr
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:08:42 <@Espeon> better stock up on batteries
<SuperBrony64> 10,02☻/
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:08:42 <Drake> 2062 then
<Polydunami> I has no monies
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:08:50 <~Armageddon> rofl
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:08:53 <~Armageddon> 2069
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:08:55 <~Armageddon> >:(
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:09:01 <Drake> fine
<Simon2> SuperBrony64: dat bob
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<MahBoi777> that's okay, you get one anyway, hurrray
<Placebo> http://dragonariaes.deviantart.com/art/Rainbow-Dash-Brohoof-Plushie-283799498
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:09:33 <~Armageddon> Drake, if you're the sniper
<Placebo> Oh wow.
<Drake> 04NS, give me the specifics of your laser weaponry
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:09:39 <~Armageddon> what is Xeli? the other sniper/madman?
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:10:06 <Drake> Xeli is the heavy weapons man.
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:10:13 <Drake> With a gun called Sasha.
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:10:15 * Drake hides
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:10:33 <~Armageddon> rofl
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:10:35 <~Armageddon> his "friends"
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> uh
<Drake> 04And we'll see if we can come to a compromise.
<Armageddon> well as I said
<Drake> 04I don't want it to be bright and flashy
<MahBoi777> that head
<Polydunami> That is amazing
<Drake> 04like "ZOMG PURE ENERGY"
<Espeon|School> 06that intro with one-shotting a helicopter makes me
<Espeon|School> 06bang my head against the table
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> Rhy only really has 2 laser weapons
<Armageddon> and yes that was terrible
<Polydunami> If a little off-model?
<Armageddon> I cringe at myself
<Espeon|School> 06also
<Espeon|School> 06>4x zoom
<Espeon|School> 06>close quarters
<Placebo> Yeah.. can't make 'em quite like the animation..
<Armageddon> 2/3/whatever
<Espeon|School> 06but it's at least somewhat viable
<Kipkat07> I R POOR
<Placebo> People still pay 300+ for them.
<Placebo> I'm in teh wrong industry
<Drake> 04well I'm gonna sound like one of those NOOB gamers who think they know everything about guns because they played CoD but really that's what I think an ACOG scope is.
<Drake> 044x zoom.
<Armageddon> heh
<Armageddon> well Draaaaaaake
*Drake should research that
<Espeon|School> 06well laser weapons that are like prototypes are often kinda interesting, and 2060 would be a suitable time for that kind of thing to be around JUST SAYING
<Armageddon> you know the hidden blade in Assassin's Creed?
<Drake> 04yes
<Drake> 04And Xeli, your point is valid
<Espeon|School> 06But no like
<Armageddon> Rhy has those but sorta laser versions
<MahBoi777> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLsLlDHUYqw&feature=player_embedded
<Armageddon> if you get what I mean
<MahBoi777> Lyra is best weapon
<Armageddon> and also a laser sword
<Espeon|School> 06fully auto star wars laser blasters
<Drake> 04well
<Polydunami> I just saw that one
<Drake> 04Is the blade completely plasma/laser?
<Polydunami> So awesome
<Drake> 04Or does it incorporate some sort of projector
<Drake> 04like
<Drake> 04A frame, then laser/plasma edges?
<MahBoi777> i know right?
*Drake sketches something quickly
<Armageddon> Center needle/spike
<Espeon|School> 06now I'm wondering how such a weapon would even work
<Armageddon> Well
<Armageddon> a central blade
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Try to think of chemistry pun...all the good ones Argon.
<Evdog> John Freeman is best wepon
<Armageddon> that projects energy around itself when activated
<Armageddon> though Rhy may use it without the energy
<Espeon|School> 06Oh that makes more sense
<Simon2> I got Chemistry test today
<Kipkat07> r moderators bad people or is that a sterotype?
<Espeon|School> 06Because the Star Wars ones just makes me go HOW DO I MAKE A LASER ONLY GO THIS AND THAT FAR AND THEN STOP but >sci-fi
<Placebo> they're horrible.
<Drake> 04That's what I was thinking
<Shizuka> 13who ist saying we are bad people :<
<Simon2> And I am definitely gonna fail because I don't know most questions
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm not a bad person ;____;
<Placebo> -ly fun to hang with
<Drake> 04Exactly Xeli
<Radu> Dat iFluid
<Drake> 04That's what I didn't want
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm a bad pony :>
<Drake> 04What colour is the energy/laser/plasma?
*SuperBrony64 glomps Kipkat07
<Placebo> que saxy music
<Drake> 04Because if it's blue I will shoot someone
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U
<SuperBrony64> 10,02U SO SILLY
<Espeon|School> 06rainbow
<Placebo> Ikr?
<Armageddon> I was going to say blue
<Espeon|School> 06:3
<Armageddon> lmao
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Tell a Potassium joke?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02K
<Sillyfilly> I r best.
<Radu> O U
<Sillyfilly> Lol!
<Drake> 04well
<Drake> 04if it's a light blue
<Drake> 04that's fine
<Armageddon> light blue
<Evdog> Anypony here not from the US?
<Armageddon> not dark blue
<Drake> 04I keep imagining this Mega-Man blaster blue
<TOY_PON3> Guys..I'm sad :(
<Drake> 04and I'm like goddamnit
<Armageddon> ._.
<Armageddon> well
<MahBoi777> I am
<Espeon|School> 06can't unsee
<Armageddon> if you need a precise colour
<Drake> 04EXACTLY XELI
<Armageddon> it'd be like Anakin's blue lightsaber
<MahBoi777> what's wrong TOY_PON3?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02TOY_PON3: Awwww...what happened?
<Drake> 04...Sure that works
*SuperBrony64 hugs TOY_PON3
<Drake> 04Since it's small it isn't like "SHINE"
<Kipkat07> i is from CT liek a bau5
*TOY_PON3 hugs SuperBrony64 back
*Polydunami calls for group hug
<Armageddon> XD
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That names Bond...Ionic Bond...Taken, not shared.
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> if Rhy needs to be stealthy
<MahBoi777> .....brilliant
<Armageddon> she doesn't activate the energy
<Sillyfilly> Do you have a joke on Sodium? Na...
<Armageddon> since it's still usable without
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U
<SuperBrony64> 10,02U SO SILLY
<Armageddon> but it's far more potent with
<Sillyfilly> Ikr?
<TOY_PON3> I..I listened to MLD well the reading...
<Kipkat07> wat do mods do at night (that wasnt sexual)
<Sillyfilly> saxy music.
<Sillyfilly> nao
<Evdog> K I'm in Australia
<Polydunami> I have a Carbon joke, C?
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: yes? please go on
<Kipkat07> MLD IS SO SAD!!!!!
<Drake> 04Like instead of locking blades you'd melt right through it
<MahBoi777> ikr?
<Drake> 04Or cutting a hole through a door/wall
<Armageddon> yeah
<Radu> Tell a Ytrium joke. Y?
<Armageddon> well I dunno whether it'd be /that/ powerful
<Radu> So many chemistry jokes
<Sillyfilly> We should take all these bad jokes and just Barium.
<Armageddon> don't want to overpower it
<Evdog> Snapples: Apples infused with Tin.
<MahBoi777> oh mah gawd
<TOY_PON3> I regret it. And then I listened to that She Loved Me song with Woona and Celestia :(
<Armageddon> since something that's that small probably won't be powerful enough to cut through a door/wall
<Sillyfilly> You fool
<Espeon|School> 06A laser blade IS overpowered, but at the same time it's instadeath if you fuck up and hit yourself
<Polydunami> I'm in Canada
<Espeon|School> 06therefore it's balanced
*Espeon|School hides
*Sillyfilly handes TOY_PON3 a glass of water
<Armageddon> lmao
<MahBoi777> das a sad combination
<TOY_PON3> I know!
<Sillyfilly> Take this. You'll die of dehydration from manly tears.
*TOY_PON3 cries
<MahBoi777> hands TOY_PON3 a tissue
<Espeon|School> 06and what would really happen if two laser blades clash anyway?
<MahBoi777> oopsie, lol
*TOY_PON3 drinks water but still pouts
<Polydunami> Umm I'm sad too y'know
<Armageddon> fizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sparks
<Radu> Wait, you regret reading MLD?
<Drake> 04kaboom
<Polydunami> My grandma passed away two weeks ago
<Drake> 04Or they'd both shortcircuit or something
<Armageddon> wouldn't be kaboom since the energy is balanced
<MahBoi777> I regret nothing!
<Armageddon> it's not exactly electricity
<TOY_PON3> No I don't regret it I just regret crying again
<Espeon|School> 06and I hope you don't plan on blocking boolets or something with it
<TOY_PON3> But it's hard not to.
<Radu> Feel sorry for you, Polydunami
<Armageddon> boolets?
<Sillyfilly> Chemistry jokes are Sodium funny.
<Espeon|School> 06bullets
<Espeon|School> 06:po
<Polydunami> I'm fine
<Armageddon> hell no
<Espeon|School> 06GOOD
<TOY_PON3> Polydunami: Sorry bro..
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Annoying Facebook Girl: "Dislikes: Reading Likes: Twilight"
<Polydunami> Thanks guys
<Evdog> XD
<Radu> xD
<Armageddon> It's not nearly big enough and Rhy's not psychic
<Polydunami> Also, so true SB
<Drake> 04ACOG goes from 1.5x to 6x
<MahBoi777> Polydynami: I'm srry to hear that man
<Drake> 04Hmm
<Espeon|School> 06<~Armageddon> It's not nearly big enough <- saved for future generations
<TOY_PON3> Thanks SuperBrony64 that made me laugh a bit
<TOY_PON3> :)
<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04What would be ideal for close-quarters combat with a single shot rifle?
<Drake> 04XD
<Evdog> Did anyone pick up the pun in Avatar?
<Polydynami> Yeah, no worries :3
<Evdog> Unobtanium?
<Armageddon> Rhy's hidden blades?
<Armageddon> so anyway
<Drake> 04What level of magnification?
<Armageddon> they can't cut through walls
<Armageddon> unless you think that's okay
<Drake> 04also
<Drake> 04http://i40.tinypic.com/1zgdufp.jpg
<Espeon|School> 06And yeah, but for close range aimpoint would probably be better ("red dot sight") buuut
<Drake> 04Is that a reasonable rendition of it's general idea?
*TOY_PON3 takes a deep breath and grabs the tissue and wipes away tears
<Sillyfilly> I don't like these jokes. I'm not getting any reactions.
<Drake> 04Red dot scopes look weird
<TOY_PON3> I'm okay now.
<Sillyfilly> ba dum tuss.
<Drake> 04But I'll think about it
<Polydunami> O U
<Polydunami> U SO SILLY
<Drake> 04I don't want to go on the CoD wiki, that's all. Probably not all that accurate
<Armageddon> haha Drake
<TOY_PON3> hehe
<Evdog> I used to think water looked like Mickey Mouse
<Placebo> wut.
<Polydunami> Oh goodness
<Espeon|School> 06But a single shot rifle should probably stick to mid range anyway
<Placebo> I'm off to bed. Night everyone.
<TOY_PON3> SillyFilly is Placebo?! :O
<Espeon|School> 06And that's the most logical approach to an energy weapon I've seen in a while :p
<Placebo> wut?
<Espeon|School> 06at least a melee-kind of one.
<Evdog> Just saw this on T.V: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIPq6Ouw0KY
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04yeah, same
<Armageddon> they're not as big as swords
<Espeon|School> 06not LOL MAGICAL LASER STOPPING FOR NO REASON
<Drake> 04I actuallylike it
<Espeon|School> 06lazor dagger
<Drake> 04And NS, no swords
<TOY_PON3> I'm confused :P
<Armageddon> it's more like daggers rather than swords
<Drake> 04of any kind
<Armageddon> ):
<Placebo> wub.
*MahBoi777 takes a long walk to ponder things
<Placebo> Night
<TOY_PON3> Anyways night Placebo

<MahBoi777> gnight
<Placebo> Just for the hell of it

<Polydunami> Goodnight Placebo
<Armageddon> it wouldn't be that long

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Night Placebo!
<Phase4> i'm back, now with more ipv6 :3
<Armageddon> I think the max would be around from Rhy's wrist to her elbows
<Placebo> obai Phase4
<Phase4> night Placebo
<Phase4> lol
<Espeon|School> 06And lets just say that leo should have a bolt action rifle and a revolver because swag. But really, it's what I'd imagine that character having.
<TOY_PON3> It's okay SuperBrony64 you made me feel better :3
<Evdog> cya
<Espeon|School> 06And yeah dagger length then
<Armageddon> otherwise it'd limit movement
<Drake> 04Eh, that works
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I wanna hug you now :3
<Drake> 04lol Espeon
<Drake> 04http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Tasco_PDP2.jpg

<Radu> Why hug his back?
<Polydunami> Also, I'm confused by Sebastian the Unicorn
<Drake> 04I just don't want a circle instead of a dot
<Polydunami> And I love it
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Mods keep order in chat.
<Drake> 04I need a dot, not a circle for the reticle
<TOY_PON3> Indeed
<Simon2> My curiosity says I need to watch the leak episode
<Evdog> XD
<Armageddon> okay it's roughly 30cm
<Simon2> what should I do?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We also help out with the website and its many functions behind the scenes
<MahBoi777> Kipkat07: they're the Gods of chat per se
<TOY_PON3> Simon2: No
<Evdog> Simon2 Dont'
<Drake> 04that'll do then
<Kipkat07> soo no clopping??
<Polydunami> Too late for me, Simon2
<Evdog> prove your loyalty to Studio B
<Radu> Wait, What
<Armageddon> maybe a tiny bit longer but it's still a dagger
<MahBoi777> Simon2 resist mah boi!
<Phase4> Simon2: BE STRONG
<Phase4> DONT
<Drake> 04Yeah, that's fine
<Simon2> MahBoi777: Mah Boi
<Simon2> What's for dinner?
<Armageddon> maybe Rhy would have a reverse dagger too
<TOY_PON3> Must...stay...away...from leaked...episode!
<Armageddon> but that'd be heavy
<Polydunami> Wait for Saturday
<Phase4> what would fluttershy say Simon2 !
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Annoying Facebook Girl: "Someone posts a status about a movie they just saw...Comments 'OMG I MIS YOUUUU'"

<Radu> LMAO
*Simon2 steals SuperBrony64's tacos
<Evdog> I just wonder what Hasbro is up to
<SuperBrony64> 10,02iFluid
<Kipkat07> WAIT A LEAKED EPISODE??
<Phase4> there seems to be some kind of seafood rollign around
<Armageddon> one that comes out from her elbow instead of her wrists
<Polydunami> SHH
<Espeon|School> 06oh so that's what ACR means
<Phase4> and then it exploded
<Phase4> twice
<MahBoi777> Enough, my ship sails in the morning
<Polydunami> It's a secret!
<TOY_PON3> Kipkat07: Don't watch it!
<Shizuka> 13two levels left
<MahBoi777> secret, but fun
<Kipkat07> I aint gonna
<SuperBrony64> 10,02'Can we pretned airplanes are shooting stars, cause I could really use a wish right now'
<Evdog> Octorock
<Espeon|School> 06more obvious than expected / i'm dumb :u
<Armageddon> because the entry point of the retractable dagger is from around the top of her wrists, coming out over her hands
<Drake> 04uh
<Phase4> so you play a drop of water?
*TOY_PON3 fights off leaked episode
<MahBoi777> exactly
<Drake> 04Why would they come out from her elbows
<Phase4> neat
<TOY_PON3> Back I say back!
<RawketLawnchair> Shizuka is best streamer
<Espeon|School> 06ADAM JENSEN
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Favorite Quotes: "Shoot for the moon, even if you miss you will land among the stars"
<Shizuka> 13get your sombreros ready
<Armageddon> for a different fighting perspective
<Shizuka> 13BURRITO TIME
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:<
<Evdog> Somehow, I read 'Can we pretned airplanes are shooting stars, cause I could really use a gun right now'
<Drake> 04Also Rhy would have to be really careful with that laser dagger and her hand
<RawketLawnchair> Ole!
*MahBoi777 gives everyone a banana for no raisin
<TOY_PON3> Yay!
<Armageddon> Rhy knows how to manage it
<Drake> 04And maybe a reverse dagger on one arm, her dagger/plasma knife in the other?
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: I want that raisin
<Polydunami> Where's my Manwich?
<Simon2> iTunes: Y U HIRE DERPY?
<MahBoi777> when the time is right......use it
<Armageddon> nope
<Radu> Shizuka, what do you do to control objects?
<Simon2> NOW MY CURIOSITY IS GONNA KILL ME!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Socially Awkward Penguin 'Say Goodbye!...start walking the same way'
<Phase4> lolwut
<TOY_PON3> lol
<Phase4> that food is dancing
<Radu> IKR SB?!
<RawketLawnchair> So you can possess the round objects.
<Armageddon> or how about the dagger can move both forwards and backwards
<MahBoi777> itsa big tasty stew!
<Kipkat07> Favorite quote: Shoot First ask questions later
*Mutterguy has to admit that he did have proper mexican food until he went to the US
<SuperBrony64> 10,02'You start typing but see 'your friend is typing' so you stop...SO DO THEY'
<Armageddon> though that could be overpowered
<Armageddon> dunno though
<RawketLawnchair> I don't even like stew.
<Drake> 04Hmm
<Drake> 04I guess she'd change weapons based on the current mission
<MahBoi777> thought I'd try shooting my way out, mix things up a little
<Armageddon> Rhy is far too lazy
<Drake> 04She can have a collection of different CQC weapons
<Armageddon> well duh she would
<Radu> What a weird kitchen...
<Simon2> ded
<Armageddon> she also has a collection of daggers and different blades on her wherever she goes
<Kipkat07> you guys are nicer than my friends:P
<MahBoi777> this mexican food is what all true warriors strive for!
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_M82
<Armageddon> "NO NATHAN, DON'T TOUCH MY HOARD OF KNIVES" *stab*
<Espeon|School> 06that stuff is heavier than you might think :p
<Shizuka> 13roaches!
<Armageddon> yeah
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CheyTac_Intervention
<Drake> 04Can't decide
<Phase4> Radu: Shizuka is playing a sentient drop of water and your problem is with the kitchen?
<Drake> 04which rifle
<Armageddon> I know
<Polydunami> Welcome to bronyhood, my friend
<TOY_PON3> Kipkat07: Nice to know :3
<Radu> xD
<Phase4> ohai Kipkat07
<Armageddon> hahahaha Drake
<Armageddon> I just thought of Rhy as Larxene-like
<MahBoi777> Kipkat07: that's good right? lol I kid I kid
<Drake> 04I guess Nathan would go into combat with either his ACR or his sniper
<SuperBrony64> 10,02'Stalking your crush's Facebook timeline...accidentally 'like' a status from five years ago...they get a notification'
<Drake> 04LOL
*Mutterguy doesn't get the corgette kebabs
<Drake> 04Larxene lol
<TOY_PON3> Whoa
<Radu> xD
<Armageddon> they're pretty similar
<Armageddon> except Rhy is /not/ that sadistic
<Radu> Woow, roaches :O
<TOY_PON3> Dat stalker
<Kipkat07> AHHHH WTB????
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Polydunami> If you do that, do it to someone else too
<Polydunami> :3
<Mutterguy> see!
<Espeon|School> 06I love how you found monster caliber rifles
<Mutterguy> makes no sense
<Espeon|School> 06Compensating?
*Espeon|School hides
<Kipkat07> brb
<Simon2> meh...
<Drake> 04hurr hurr whynot
*Drake runs
<Simon2> back to playing Saints Row the third
<Polydunami> Ok
<MahBoi777> What is the most important rule in chemistry? Never lick the spoon!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02'Goes to check mail, sees mailman still there...goes back inside'
*TOY_PON3 wishes he could see stream but still has HW :(
<Drake> 04I just think those two weapons look awesome and they seem pretty practical.
<Simon2> and watch the stream at the same time
<Evdog> PURPLE!
<Shizuka> 13okay now this level i need help on...
<Radu> xD
<Shizuka> 13cause i never remember
<Phase4> and then every thing exploded?
<Simon2> lol
<TOY_PON3> brb gotta finish HW
<Espeon|School> 06No kill like overkill.
<Polydunami> Take care
<TOY_PON3> Shizuka: Good luck
<Armageddon> lmao
<Shizuka> 13as soon as i get tehre..
<Drake> 04But then I figure Nathan would go fir the legs
<MahBoi777> brace yourselves
<Drake> 04Since aversion to killing
<MahBoi777> bad joke incoming
<Armageddon> I don't think Rhy would mind killing
<Drake> 04And when half your leg is missing then I don't think they'd worry about scrambling for their gun
<Polydunami> Uh-oh
<TOY_PON3> Oh noes...
<Espeon|School> 06Yeah, go for the legs with a .50 cal and have them bleed to death from a stump
<Espeon|School> 06good idea
<MahBoi777> Silver walks up to Gold in a bar and says, "AU, get outta here!"
<Evdog> OH NOSE!
<Armageddon> lmao
<SuperBrony64> 10,02MahBoi777: O U
<SuperBrony64> 10,02U SO SILLY
*Mutterguy set the chat status to red alert
<Espeon|School> 06"I didn't kill them, the bleeding did!"
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: Mother of God..
<MahBoi777> :D
<Armageddon> hahaha
<Armageddon> well Drake
<Drake> 04Well hey, I have a lot to learn about guns
<Shizuka> 13faaaaail
<SuperBrony64> 10,02'Teacher asks you to hand back assignments...Panic as you don't know names of anyone in class.'
<Drake> 04Would .50 cal be good for anti-material?
*Evdog sets the chat status to "Red Alert 2"
<Radu> mfw stream is waaaaaaay behind
<RawketLawnchair> http://i44.tinypic.com/fa50g1.png Ha ha!
<TOY_PON3> SuperBrony64: I do that
<Armageddon> Rhy has twin retractable energy/laser/plasma/whatever daggers that can move out either from her elbow or wrist
<Espeon|School> 06That IS it's intended role afaik so I'd assume so
<Shizuka> 13faaaaaaaaail
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:P
<Armageddon> and maybe a few throwing daggers/spare knives
<Armageddon> maybe hidden in a secret pocket in her boots
<Armageddon> :D
<TOY_PON3> no seriously I'll brb
<Armageddon> no that's lame
<Armageddon> too fucking generic
<Armageddon> ahem
<Armageddon> anyway
<Radu> You need help on the level, or you need help to get at the start of the level?
<Polydunami> Good luck TOY_PON3
<Evdog> He's not coming back, is he
<Armageddon> she hates guns
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Armageddon> any suggestions for a gun for her to carry?
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> since she'll probably have to carry one anyway
<Shizuka> 13this level is a real puzzla
<Drake> 04Some kind of sidearm?
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04A handgun of some kind
<MahBoi777> he'll be back.....they all come back
<Drake> 04Machine pistol?
<Armageddon> it'll be something small
<Shizuka> 13pay close attention to the instructions
<Armageddon> like a pistol
<Armageddon> yeah
<Espeon|School> 06Drake: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSR-1 for more HIGH-TECH
<SuperBrony64> 10,02"Feign laughter...get told it's an inside joke
<Espeon|School> 06And revolvers > all
<MahBoi777> poker face
<Drake> 04but the barrel
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<Nightshadow|VNC> NightSeas, you are a 4Glalie.
<Drake> 04is so small
<NightSeas> 12!eonget
<Espeon|School> 4NightSeas just got a male 3Leafeon
<Espeon|School> 06EXTEND IT
<Armageddon> Rhy'll want something small
<Espeon|School> 06That's the magic of "Near future"
<Armageddon> that's light
<Armageddon> and therefore doesn't affect her movement
<Shizuka> 13everypony writing it down?
<Drake> 04True Espeon
<Armageddon> what do we wear?
<Drake> 04A "modified" DSR-1
<Shizuka> 13we need five colors and some number
<Espeon|School> 06Or just be clever and call it dsr-some other number. But sure
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<Nightshadow|VNC> NightSeas, you are a 11Mantyke.
<Noir> What in the moon is going on?
<Armageddon> I imagine Rhy would be wearing leather armour since she's a close combatist
<Drake> 04I was think long black pants with a black shirt
<Espeon|School> 06!pokemon
<Nightshadow|VNC> Espeon|School, you are a 14Feraligatr.
<Espeon|School> 06rawr
<Armageddon> well
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<Nightshadow|VNC> NightSeas, you are a 9Donphan.
<MahBoi777> L.A.Noir
<Shizuka> 13scattered around here are objects of the same color, for instance black is the highest chip
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Armageddon> light leather armour at least
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Here are the 5 hints: The value of a card that does not fear the wind, the confetti balls hidden in the peashooter, the lollipops that stand still, the chewing gums from the sugar temple, the number of chips with the highest value.
<Armageddon> or at least on her arms
<Drake> 04Rhy can wear whatever she wantsa
<Shizuka> 13good man~
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<SuperBrony64> 10,02imma pony :>
<MahBoi777> 6_9
<Shizuka> 13black is the highest chip
*MahBoi777 brain asplodes
<Mutterguy> Little Jimmy was a chemist, Little jimmy is no more.For what he thought was H2O was H2SO4
<Shizuka> 13green is inside the shooters
<Shizuka> 13four green so far
<Shizuka> 13so four green
<Armageddon> dunno
<MahBoi777> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Espeon|School> 06:ohdear:
<Armageddon> not sure what'd suit her
<Armageddon> leather's probably best for her type of character
<Armageddon> since generally being hit by punches which may or may not be backed by SAP gloves hurt like shit
<EpicStatsGuy> School bitches.
<Armageddon> and can cause internal bleeding
<Armageddon> Drake you bastard
<EpicStatsGuy> School bitches.
<Drake> 04If we ever go into the desert or a forest, we camoflauge accordingly.*
<Drake> 04GODDAMNIT
<Drake> 04What did I miss
<Armageddon> [20:23:32] <~Armageddon> not sure what'd suit her
<Armageddon> [20:23:34] -*status- *** Feather (killed: ERROR :Closing Link: Feather[99-39-212-230.lightspeed.rlghnc.sbcglobal.net] (Ping timeout))
<Armageddon> [20:24:18] <~Armageddon> leather's probably best for her type of character
<Armageddon> [20:24:41] -*status- *** Buizel (killed: ERROR :Closing Link: Buizel[99-39-212-230.lightspeed.rlghnc.sbcglobal.net] (Ping timeout))
<Armageddon> [20:24:42] <~Armageddon> since generally being hit by punches which may or may not be backed by SAP gloves hurt like shit
<Armageddon> ignore the Feather/Buizel stuff
<Armageddon> [20:24:46] <~Armageddon> and can cause internal bleeding
<Drake> 04h-uh
<Drake> 04Well, dress Rhy in whatever would suit her for CQC mostly
<Drake> 04Since it's her strong point she'd focus on that
<Drake> 04Nathan, he'd rely more on practicality and staying in one place.
<Drake> 04So lightweight (snipers are HEAVY)
<Shizuka> 13card that does not fear wind is red 5
<Drake> 04!delgreet
<Armageddon> Well
<Armageddon> Rhy's speed is her strong point
<Evdog> 18
<Drake> 04So she needs to be lightweight, yet able to withstand heavy melee hitsa
<Armageddon> she is moderately strong but there are quite a few who can outclass her in that area
<Drake> 04hits*
<MahBoi777> I wish I cud double jump
<Armageddon> well she can withstand heavy melee hits
<Armageddon> but prefers not to
<MahBoi777> but gravity hates me
<Armageddon> she relies more on her speed rather than strenght
<Armageddon> strength
<SuperBrony64> 10,02'Happy Birthday!' 'You too!'
<Armageddon> though she normally varies her tactics depending on the situation
<Armageddon> she's used to fighting multiple enemies at once
<Armageddon> which requires speed more than strength
<Radu> What if it's really actually their birthday too?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Then it's Tuesday.
<Radu> xD
<Drake> 04ah
<MahBoi777> well, there's the cake
<Mutterguy> that applies to me and someone i know SuperBrony64
<Shizuka> 13lollipops that stand still is white 4
<Drake> 04Remember we won't be all that badass at the start. We still need to train and get used to missions.
<Drake> 04and fuck, I should be finishing that story
<MahBoi777> that is one epic little drop of water
<Drake> 04And we still haven't sorted out Leo's skills
<Armageddon> yeah
*Armageddon slaps Xeli
<Shizuka> 13highest value chip is black 3
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:09:39 <~Armageddon> what is Xeli? the other sniper/madman?
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:10:06 <Drake> Xeli is the heavy weapons man.
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:10:42 <Drake> No, I'm not actually sure what his role was going to be.
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:10:46 <~Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:10:48 <Drake> You'd be the tech specialist.
<Drake> 04ah
<Radu> That's all?
<Drake> 04Well
<Drake> 04not heavy weapons
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> <Drake> You are the tech specialist and close quarters combat specialist.
<Drake> 04explosives specialist
<Shizuka> 13sugar temple is blue 4
<Mutterguy> watermelon good or bad?
<Drake> 04bomb disposal
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:12:14 <Drake> I'm the marksman and saboteur.
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:12:55 <Drake> Xeli can maybe be the demolitions expert, espionage specialist and the all-rounder.
<Armageddon> Apr 26 21:13:41 <Drake> NS unlocks doors, Xeli gets me past the guards, and I sabotage the mehcanics while Xeli uses explosive charges to cover our exit and NS wipes the floor with anyone who gets in our way.
<Drake> 04Damn, I am so glad you kept these logs.
<Espeon|School> 06well that'd be fine but would benefit from somewhat other weaponry then
<Espeon|School> 06and yes
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04Remember to save these ones as well
<Espeon|School> 06they come in handy
<Radu> And once you find out the answers, what do you do?
<Armageddon> these are automatically saved
<MahBoi777> I'm going to Kiddie Land!
<Drake> 04I prefer to save important logs in .tct docs to make them easy to find
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Who wants to help me with a homework problem?
<Armageddon> Ah
<Drake> 04Plus I crashed earlier so I don't know what's going on
<Armageddon> I just browse through my stuff
<Polydunami> Hmm...
<Radu> We all can, if we know
<Radu> Ask away
<MahBoi777> I can try
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Nvm, can't copy and paste.
<Shizuka> 13so
<SuperBrony64> 10,02FAAAAAAAAAAAIL
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai Shizuka :3
<Armageddon> heh anyway Drake
<Drake> 04Oh nice, the DSR-50 is basically a .50 cal DSR-1
<Armageddon> I think Rhy needs some other weapons
<Radu> Possessed die.
<MahBoi777> dat drop can do anything
<Drake> 04a baton?
<Drake> 04Machine pistol?
<Espeon|School> 06you and your overkill calibers.
<Drake> 04Nathan's gonna get the big guns at some point
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_pistol
<Drake> 04maybe an uzi, NS?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You did it :D
<Phase4> confound my stomach, it drives me to eat
<MahBoi777> I miss mah dinner:'(
<Armageddon> o_O
<Armageddon> Uzi, Drake?
<Armageddon> and Drake, she needs a longer-ranged weapon, that's not just a gun
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzi
<Drake> 04Throwing knife?
<Shizuka> 13hmm
<Armageddon> close combat
<Drake> 04You said longer-ranged
<Armageddon> longer
<Armageddon> not long
<Shizuka> 13going to see if this notebook has my notes ><
<Espeon|School> 06http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_knife
<Kipkat07> HAI EVERYPONY I IS BACK!!!
<Armageddon> than her daggers
*Espeon|School hides
<Drake> 04Well there isn't much she can
<Drake> 04LOL XELI
<Phase4> ohai Kipkat07
<Espeon|School> 06really it would kind of suit what she has said about the character this far
<Polydunami> Oh hey Kipkat I didn't hear you there :3
<Espeon|School> 06even though it sounds rather impractical in general xp
<MahBoi777> Hi Kipkat07
<Simon2> dat Kipkat07
<Shizuka> 13hm when the notebook opens with a list of bronystate mods, that's a good sign it's too recent ><
<MahBoi777> lol
<Drake> 04Yet it's an actual weapon
<Kipkat07> do mods ever leave a room unmonitored or do they work in shifts?
<Armageddon> lololol
<Radu> Yes.^
<Drake> 04I dunno NS
<Armageddon> I think that suits Rhy
<Drake> 04There isn't much that's better that's practical
<MahBoi777> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QerOwpd3WBc
<Armageddon> staff?
<Phase4> mods do all sleep sometimes
<Armageddon> retractable staff
<Shizuka> 13well... crap... none of these notebooks has it...
<Armageddon> so it's easy to carry around
<Armageddon> dunno
<Noir> what is the goal of that game?
<Drake> 04That's basically a baton
<Armageddon> Rhy's skilled enough to be able to beat pretty much all opponents at close combat
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> but longer
<MahBoi777> Kipkat07: I think they go in shifts, lol
<Kipkat07> o
<MahBoi777> Noir: to show the world you are one awesome water drop
<Kipkat07> has anyone seen SHED.MOV
<MahBoi777> we can't discuss that
<Kipkat07> :(
<Noir> I havent seen that yet.
<MahBoi777> yeaaaaa
<MahBoi777> srry
<Drake> 04I guess a staff/baton that's retractable could work
<Radu> SHED.MOV? another episode?:(
<MahBoi777> hm
<MahBoi777> ?
<Radu> Shizuka, wasn't it 4 white?
<Armageddon> it's mainly against anyone who has longer blades
<Drake> 04http://i39.tinypic.com/4rarm1.jpg
<Shizuka> 13yay
<Drake> 04This is what happens
<Shizuka> 13apparently 6 white
<Drake> 04when we talk about guns
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yay!
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Radu> squee
<Kipkat07> ESPLOSIN
<Shizuka> 13and finally!
<Radu> inb4Boss
<Drake> 04The ACR Colt looks pretty good
<Drake> 04http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/NIMcase444ACRtest.jpg
<Espeon|School> 06lol
<MahBoi777> huzzah
<Drake> 04The one on the bottom
<Armageddon> Well anyway
<Armageddon> Rhy'll have her primary laser/energy/plasma daggers
<Radu> Credits?
<Armageddon> a retractable staff
<Drake> 04The one above it is also pretty cool
<Radu> Why is it named Level 15 then?
<Espeon|School> 06And if Leo would be like
<Espeon|School> 06all-round and between long and close range
<Armageddon> some lightweight throwing knives
<Espeon|School> 06http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMI_Tavor_TAR-21 that :P
<Espeon|School> 06Aaaand brb
<Armageddon> and also some ballistic knives probably
<Drake> 04shit
<Drake> 04nice gun
<MahBoi777> just cause
<Espeon|School> 06urge to pun rising
<Armageddon> nice
<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04XD
<Kipkat07> Whats the difference in the chat rooms?
<Armageddon> Anyway
<Espeon|School> 06and I am consciously looking for kinda
<Drake> 04It also has semi-automatic, burst and automatic
<Espeon|School> 06future--looking ones
<Armageddon> Rhy is a mostly CQC + knives person
<Drake> 04so it's basically for everything
<Armageddon> hates guns
<Armageddon> only uses them if she has too
<Armageddon> besides, she's terrible at aiming with handguns
<Polydunami> Please elaborate?
<Polydunami> Also, you win the credits
<Armageddon> but she's pretty good at turrets/cannons/weapons on planes/jets/aircraft
<Drake> 04Wheras Nathan is the rifleman, who focuses on sophistication, accuracy and power. He's horrible at CQC, and prefers to leave it to Rhy to cover his back.
<Radu> Easiest level=Level 15
<Drake> 04He keeps a knife on him, but he's terrible with it.
<Kipkat07> like RD and Fluttershy or Twilight and Applejack is there any difference in language or stuff?
<Drake> 04He prefers single-shot or burst fire rifles as well over automatic weaponry
<Polydunami> Oh.
<Espeon|School> 06Leo's "CQC" should be summed up with "Revolver"
<MahBoi777> Kipkat07: I don really know, I've been here for a week, lol
<Shizuka> 13and that's all for me ponies~
<Radu> :c
<Armageddon> Rhy focuses on speed, power only with the staff since there's no dangers of cutting yourself to pieces, and also precision with her throwing knives/hits
<Espeon|School> 06and this sure became
<Espeon|School> 06brainstormy
<Kipkat07> D:
<Armageddon> XD
<MahBoi777> utter sadness
<Noir> Im going to go play some PS3, later everypony.
<MahBoi777> later Noir
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Nice stream Shizuka!
<Kipkat07> :'(:'(:'(
<Polydunami> Thanks for gracing us with your water sports :3
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Great job on the Portal speed run :3
<MahBoi777> do not cry mai friend
<Kipkat07> But... we liked you...
<Radu> And, admire Cathedral Zero
<Armageddon> Rhy isn't the sort of "stab anywhere" person, she aims for points to hit and usually hits them hard
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Is it time for an SB stream?
<Radu> YES
<MahBoi777> AW YEA
<Armageddon> she might take some time to take down a single enemy if they're good, but it's usually because she's carefully calculating how to kill them
<Armageddon> or decapitate them
<Radu> Dat Why are you here?
<MahBoi777> because ponies
<Drake> 04decapitate
<Polydunami> I saw this in a movie
<Drake> 04so much for trauma
<SuperBrony64> 10,02PONIEZ
<MahBoi777> I can't go home
<MahBoi777> I'm already here
<Drake> 041154 words so far.
<Polydunami> Why am I here? Why are we all here? Why do we live?
*Drake headdesks
<Armageddon> Well
<Polydunami> Is it really worth it?
<Shizuka> 13tomorrow i will get past that dumm mission in freespace...
<Armageddon> Rhy isn't as affected as Nathan is
<Radu> Oh MAN
<MahBoi777> aliens man, just aliens
<Kipkat07> ME GUSTA
<Armageddon> and I suppose you could have Nathan normally tell her to "stop aiming for the neck"
<Shizuka> 13one of the earlier bomber missions kept crashing on stream too
<Radu> Dat RD
<MahBoi777> and suddenly sax1
<Espeon|School> 06>decapitate
<Espeon|School> 06>dagger
<MahBoi777> awwww yeaa, lol
<Kipkat07> :O
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You can do it Shizuka :D
<Espeon|School> 06unless the energy thing of course
<Espeon|School> 06NECKS ARE STURDY OKAY
<Armageddon> well duh
<Kipkat07> <3<3<3
<Polydunami> Is she coming closer to the screen?
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Polydunami> WHAIO
<SuperBrony64> 10,02LOL
<Radu> RD is so... feminine!
<Armageddon> she normally uses the energy in big fights
<MahBoi777> nope, you must be gettin closer Polydunami:D
<Drake> 04That could be a point of conflict between then
<Polydunami> OH
<Armageddon> because people use guns and they're steel
<Radu> Dat Trixie :O
<Armageddon> yeah Drake
<MahBoi777> ikr?
<Drake> 04Nathan is opposed to killing, whereas Rhy has a less stiff view on killing
<Kipkat07> YESSSSSSS I LOVE THIS SITE :D<36_9
<Armageddon> we'll probably need one late on then
<Armageddon> well
<MahBoi777> YES!
<Drake> 04So Rhy will keep telling him to use the .50 cal
*Drake runs
<MahBoi777> SUCCESS
<Armageddon> Rhy is almost "kill or be killed" but not quite
<Phase4> suddenly trixie
<Armageddon> lmao
<MahBoi777> ohai Phase4
<Phase4> ohai MahBoi777
<Polydunami> But I'm backing away from the screen. Does that mean I'm moving closer negatively?
<Drake> 04Nathan would constantly be thinking "They're just doing their job, like us. Why should I kill them when they probably have friends just like me?"
<MahBoi777> indeed sir
<Simon2> SuperBrony64: O U
<Armageddon> Rhy wouldn't think that at all really
<Espeon|School> 06I'm sure Leo can make a few snide remarks about that.
<Armageddon> She might give some thought
<Armageddon> but she won't dwell on it
<Armageddon> haha
<MahBoi777> this sax music is great
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:>
<Armageddon> Leo's in-between
<Polydunami> GAH
<Phase4> wah
<Phase4> what
<Phase4> suddenly
<Espeon|School> 06even though as I said, he's not a psycopath or anything he just
<Armageddon> Leo's like the balance of Rhy and Nathan
<Espeon|School> 06does what it takes
<Armageddon> yeah
<MahBoi777> time for de magiks
<Radu> Superbrony is a naauuuughhtyyy pony
<nido> macdonalds in the netherlands have ponies now
<MahBoi777> naaaaaaaauuuuughty
<Espeon|School> 06oh no don't tell me he's becoming some kind of peacekeeping uncle because that's just like with us three
<MahBoi777> lmao
*Espeon|School hides
<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04wynaut
<Radu> Dat Twi ._.
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04he's the one that stops us from failing constantly
<Armageddon> well
<Kipkat07> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee:O
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<Phase4> Why So Twilight :P
<MahBoi777> I'm okay with this strangely
<Polydunami> My mind says run away, but my body
<Drake> 04And why
<Armageddon> As much as Rhy is "kill or be killed"
<Drake> 04when I imagine Leo
<nido> nevermind, i was way behind in the conversation
<Radu> mfw no zoom
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Y SO SRS?
<Polydunami> says DASH
<Drake> 04why can't I get the image of SOlid Snake out of my head
<Radu> Y U NO ZOOM
<MahBoi777> ah the halloeen theme
<Phase4> Radu: it is
<Armageddon> She's not a sadistic type of person (not really)
<Espeon|School> 06well this far Rhy is more like snake than him so :P
<Radu> oh
<Armageddon> she doesn't enjoy killing
<Phase4> see
<Radu> GAAAAAAAAH
<Armageddon> lmao
<MahBoi777> dat smile, it's so pearly
<Kipkat07> eeeeeeeeeee:O:'(
<Drake> 04So she's like, "I kill but I don't necessarily enjoy it"
<Armageddon> yeah
<MahBoi777> Hold your ground......
<Radu> Lesson Zero is tooooooo overrated
<Drake> 04It's funny that Nathan doesn't like killing but is in the profession where you kill opponents with almost factory-like ease.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02FYI: This is Zelda music
<Armageddon> She's like Seran except without the sadist bit
<MahBoi777> ummmmm...
<Polydunami> When I first went to the scary part of Ancient Cistern, I was like, WHOA
<Armageddon> heh
<Espeon|School> 06well it might make sense that he picks something where
<Espeon|School> 06he doesnt have to get up close and personal
*MahBoi777 stares into it like a baws
<Espeon|School> 06for his own sake
<MahBoi777> merry christmas?
<Kipkat07> do you take requests?
<MahBoi777> is it that time again?
<Polydunami> Look out!
<MahBoi777> OH NO
<Armageddon> Well Rhy normally nearly kills herself by jumping from level to level and usually she only survives because she lands on someone else
<Polydunami> Also, song to look up?
<MahBoi777> Fall back!
<Armageddon> or there's something to break her fall
<Armageddon> and Nathan is usually pissed about that
<MahBoi777> retreat
<Armageddon> and Rhy's all "it's okay, I knew he was there so I landed on him"
<Polydunami> OH SHI
<Espeon|School> 06lol
<Armageddon> also, grappling hooks?
<Polydunami> Run away
<Polydunami> now
<Drake> 04urgh
<MahBoi777> helloooooo

<MahBoi777> LOL
<Espeon|School> 06and well those actually do exist as long as they're not.. yeah
<Armageddon> no, just no
<Polydunami> Rarity plz
<MahBoi777> YES
<Armageddon> it's mainly for scaling walls
<Kipkat07> PUT THIS PLZZZZ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UB9ELCC-kM&feature=g-like&context=G24a3e12ALTzOBwAA4AA
<Radu> SB has something in mind >:)

<Drake> 04That's what they're used for anyway
<Radu> Mother of GOD
<Drake> 04like this
<MahBoi777> OH NO
<Drake> 04Rhy quickly motioned with her hand for Nathan to move into position next to her. With the grappling hook in hand, the hazel-haired boy attached the claw to the metal pipe in front of him as the watchmen turned the corner in front of them, and quickly rappelled down, followed by Leo.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02This is how bad I am.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02"It's ok Twilight" Princess Celestia said to her﻿ young pupil. "Every dragon has to live on it's own at some point"
<SuperBrony64> 10,02"I know,"Twilight replied. "But Spike was more then just a dragon. He was a friend."
<Armageddon> since this is essentially 2069

<Drake> 04Exactly
<Phase4> this is cool
<Phase4> i like this
<Armageddon> that's even worse than Reminiscence
<Drake> 04But then we take solace in the fact that the three are together and that they can at least live their loves how they want to, without Indie (The leader of the mercenary company) watching their every move.

<pony1> so many remixxxxssssss
<Drake> 04You can be the pilot, sure
<MahBoi777> VINYL
<Armageddon> fiiiiine
<DeadpoolDash> pony troll is best troll pony
<Drake> 04But not personal aircraft
<Espeon|School> 06that would imply loads e money
<Armageddon> we'd have loads of money
<Drake> 04The company is rich, but not THAT rich
<Simon2> Missle Launcher is the best weapon ever in Sains Row
<Armageddon> or at least the company would
<Armageddon> true
<Armageddon> well
<Polydunami> dat Fluttermeow
<Armageddon> they'd have to have fighters
<MahBoi777> lol, thot this was one man band for a second
<Drake> 04A single aircraft per team
<Armageddon> yeah
<Kipkat07> shark gun try again
<Drake> 04Plus a pilot if necessary, which it isn't
<Armageddon> or at least a shuttle + fighter
<MahBoi777> Filly sauce is a good one
<Rainbowjack> YEAH!!!
<Armageddon> since shuttles are no use for dogfights
<Rainbowjack> love this song
<Drake> 04mmm
<Drake> 04Helicopters as well
<MahBoi777> dis is exercise music
<Armageddon> they lack manoeuvrability
<Armageddon> wel
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04but they're more used for local operations
<Armageddon> shuttles or helicopters
<Armageddon> personally I'd go for shuttles
<MahBoi777> where is Richard Simmons when u need him.
<Rainbowjack> its a 80's remix with becoming popular
<Armageddon> since they're faster and quieter
<Polydunami> You spelled Rarity wrong :3
<Armageddon> but helicopters are generally associated with these sorts of things anyway
<Armageddon> and shuttles might be a bit advanced
<Rainbowjack> its not mine
<Drake> 04yeah
<pony1> is everyone dancing!! \^.^/
<Drake> 04By "Shuttles" do you mean something like
<Armageddon> fighters should be fine
<Drake> 04a plane that can hover?
<Kipkat07> yep
<Radu> mfw I missed Twilight and RD at McDonald's :(

<Jim> I just realised that my charger wasn't connected to my laptop
<MirrorImage> yeah, that would make a difference
<Jim> Noticed it first when it shut down from low battery ^^
<MirrorImage> that's why i keep the backlight setting on my computer lower when it's running on battery
<MirrorImage> makes it much more obvious when it drops the A/C cord
<emangamer> I'm MC Historical Inacuracies. I drop lyrical bombs like Hyroshima in '73.
*emangamer hugs MirrorImage
*Rainbowjack hugs jim

<Kammerjunk> Oh, Mr Crowley, did you talk to the dead?
<emantrollslayer> Kammerjunk: dat song
<emanCrowley> Kammerjunk: are you implying somethign?
<Phase4> funny thing about australia, you know how you hear its full of spiders?
<Kammerjunk> emanCrowley: Your life style to me seemed so tragic, with the thrill of it all.
<Phase4> thats not entirely untrue
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - it's not a bunch of little spiders, it's one "holy crap that's a big ass spider" spider?
<ScootaChicken> suddenly activity
<Kammerjunk> You fooled all the people with magic.
<emanCrowley> Phase4: no, I hear its full of deserts, kangaroos, and koalas
<Kammerjunk> You waited on Satan's call.
<Phase4> emanCrowley: that too
<emangamer> Phase4: <3
<Jim> Australia, the place where spiders are so large they've got a hp-bar
<ScootaChicken> mfw I saw emantrollslayer
<Phase4> emangamer: wub
<ScootaChicken> well shit, time to hide
<emangamer> I'm MC Canadian Sterotype
<emangamer> Please pardon me while I get off the ice
<Kammerjunk> I'm sadly not a stereotype.
<Phase4> my house is full of these things http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redback_spider
*emangamer hugs ScootaChicken "You know I wub woo <3"
<Kammerjunk> I'm just another brick in the wall.
<Phase4> there under the house, not inside
<Jim> Omagawd D:
<Phase4> though there is one on the roof
<MirrorImage> dude_that's_creepy.mp3
<Phase4> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Redbackwithlizard2.JPG
<emangamer> if my house had these spiders I would be fine with it: http://s3-ak.buzzfed.com/static/imagebuzz/web02/2009/1/13/12/anigif_now-its-even-cu-4856-1231868931-6_preview.gif
<ScootaChicken> Phase4: Just about everything in Australia is trying to kill you
<Phase4> ScootaChicken: my cat isnt
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: but, I'm not in australia, and I've killed him twice
<emangamer> thats why he's a zombie now
<ScootaChicken> ORISIT?
<Jim> It's plotting
<Phase4> ScootaChicken: *dramatic face*
<emangamer> I could kill him again and bring him back to life where he isn't a zombie if you want
<MirrorImage> ScootaChicken - i believe that's why australia was initially a british penal colony
<emangamer> Australia- the land of cut throats and pickpockets
<Phase4> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsman_spider these are the ones you get inside the house
<MirrorImage> grrr... i need to find a way to turn off "hit esc to close window" in this program...
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Dude. That's terrifying.
<Jim> British prisoners sendt there to die from the wildlife, but they kicked the wildlife's ass. Something like that?
<emangamer> what program?
<PinkiePie101> anyone streaming?
<ScootaChicken> teehee MirrorImage, 'penal'
<MirrorImage> ScootaChicken - as in prison
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: What are you using?
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: teehee... penis
<ScootaChicken> I know.
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - Trillian
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: what do you meen terrifying? there not toxic and they keep the spiders out
<ScootaChicken> But I'm British, I make these connections
<MirrorImage> esc is a hot key to close a messenger window
<Kammerjunk> I like Trillian. She's a nice gal.
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: I can make connections about you from the face you are british, but you might not like them
<xcanox> I'm not happy Bob. Not happy.
<Jim> I wish I had a knife that toasts toast..
<emangamer> like the fact that ScootaChicken smells like really greasy food because he is british
<emangamer> In hell the food is british...get over it
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: i meen fly;s, not spiders
<Phase4> its 1am, i;m allowed to derp
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: you are a proper wanker.
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Still terrifying.
<Kammerjunk> I like British breakfast. I have no idea what you guys eat for the other meals.
<Kammerjunk> And dearly, my Frank, I don't damn a give.

<Jim> I like how there is like nothing up here in the nature that's dangerous for me.
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: umm.... I think you might have made a mistake there
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Hi dear. I'm Frank. Give Nathan a donut.
*emangamer eats said donut

<Jim> Oh, look at Derpy! http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/223/289/lMjMl.gif
*emangamer slaps Jim
*Jim is slapped
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho, that slaps me on the knee.
<Kammerjunk> Not with an arrow. Go away.
*emangamer hugs Kammerjunk
*emangamer then plunges an arrow into his HEART
<Kammerjunk> ohgodwhy
<Jim> http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/220/000/130465998569.gif
<Kammerjunk> Now would be a really good time to have two hearts.
*emangamer hands Kammerjunk his heart
*emangamer dies
<Kammerjunk> Oh, gee. Thank you for that.
<Kammerjunk> What a nice colt.
*Kammerjunk replaces the heart with the one in his chest.
<Kammerjunk> So, uh... Have fun with dying and all.
<Kammerjunk> I'm going to read some fanfics.
<emangamer> Kammerjunk|Reading: may I make a suggestion?
<Kammerjunk|Reading> Shoot.
<emangamer> http://ciroton.deviantart.com/#/d3fcu5a
<Kammerjunk|Reading> Why has it become a habit for me to check the very last line for Bel Air, Walk the Dinosaur, et cetera?
<Kammerjunk|Reading> ...It's not Grimdark, is it?
<Jim> Because that could save you a lot of time
<emangamer> Kammerjunk|Reading: not really
<emangamer> Kammerjunk|Reading: it has maybe 2 dark sections and they dont even get all that dark
<Kammerjunk|Reading> Ah dun' take kahnleh t' grimdark on these 'ere parts, boi.
<emangamer> Kammerjunk|Reading: trust me, the ending is MORE than worth it
<Kammerjunk|Reading> ohokay
<emangamer> it has such a satisfying ending.
<Kammerjunk|Reading> But first, I SPILL MY DRINK.
<emangamer> GAY
<Kammerjunk|Reading> So I'm going to need more tea.
<emangamer> I hate when that hapens
<Jim> You like tea, don't you Squidward? http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/215/075/tumblr_lrdlvtwwQ31qidxg0.png
<emangamer> You like cider, dont you RainboDash?
<emangamer> anypony have any good music
<emangamer> something with ponies
<emangamer> maybe kinda sad?
<Jim> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKZ4Lv0kujQ&feature=BFa&list=PL4784E8EFC23F6075&lf=results_main
<ColgateSparkle> Erm
<ColgateSparkle> Hey
<ColgateSparkle> Since when did a MLP episode come out on a thursday?!
<Jim> !cd
<Tom> Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 2 days, 1 hours, 8 minutes, 25 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)
<ColgateSparkle> Its already up on youtube?!
<Jim> What?!
<Starlight> My friends.
<Starlight> It was a leak.
<Starlight> If you are a true brony, wait until Saturday.
<ColgateSparkle> But but but :(
<dashiee> its on youtube what?
<ColgateSparkle> Im away on saturday i cant see it then
<Jim> Well, don't post a link to it here, I don't want to see it yet
<ColgateSparkle> Okay my link lips are seeled :)
<Starlight> Again, if you're a true brony. Wait until Saturday, like I am. :)
<ColgateSparkle> No such thing as a true brony. We are all bronies together :P
<Starlight> What's more awesome? Watching it with two of your friends, or watching it with 1,000 or even more of your like-minded bronies here on Bronystate and its sibling theatre channels?
<dashiee> i wanna watch it ........ but i cant ..... but i rly .... no i'll wait ........... but but ............... sigh
<Kammerjunk|Reading> TEA
<Kammerjunk|Reading> So I decided to just take the keddle with me upstairs.
<TopHat> I watched it
<Starlight> Can I have some water? *holds up teacup with earl grey teabag*
<TopHat> what's the problem?
<ColgateSparkle> How did it get leaked anyways? :/
<TopHat> apple ejaculated prematurely
<Kammerjunk|Reading> Starlight: Mine! ALL MINE!
<Starlight> .. *GASP!*
<Kammerjunk|Reading> Instead of a Dark Lord, you will have an Earl!
<Starlight> *places hoof on Kettle* I'M touching your kettle, KAMMER!
<Kammerjunk|Reading> Actually, because you have such good taste in tea, you can have the Luna-damn water.
<Starlight> Thank you.
*Kammerjunk|Reading pours steaming hot water into Starlight's teacup.
*Starlight lets it steeps.
*Starlight sips. Ah, good tea.
<Thunderpony> I want scootaloo as a pet
<dashiee> wow sweetiebelle singing is AMAZING ........ that makes me want to see it full
*Rainbowjack gets a glass of zap apple cider and sips it
<emangamer> I'm back from the library
<Rainbowjack> wb egghead
<Jim> Welcome back
<emangamer> I saw Twilight there, so FUCK YOU
<emangamer> true story bro
<Rainbowjack> yeah 2 eggheads you can make scrabled eggs
<Jim> I am very jelly
<emangamer> besides, I'm not an egghead
<emangamer> I'm a nerd
*Rainbowjack whispers softly "egghead"
*emangamer whispers softly "STFU"
*Rainbowjack hugs Emangamer "i am sorry " and gives some zap apple cider
<Jim> http://uc77.deviantart.com/art/Rainbow-NEEEEEERD-283735148
*emangamer is drunk
<Rainbowjack> HAHA good one
<emangamer> Hey, guishe...check thish hout
<Jim> Druk at the library is the best kind of drunk
*emangamer attempts to do a backflip
*emangamer dies
*Jim uses phoenix down on emangamer n
*Rainbowjack uses Phoenix down on Emangamer
*emangamer stays ded
<Rainbowjack> lol
*Rainbowjack pours some zap apple cider into Eman
<emangamer> You guys forget that Pheonix Downs dont work then the blood has too much of a BAC
*emangamer twitches, but stays ded
<Jim> Great, cure boose with more boose, sounds legit
<emangamer> ^
<Rainbowjack> lets get zacora she will be hungry by now umm... i mean she might have a cure
<Jim> Nopony is getting gobbled today
<emangamer> so apparently Keauno Reeves is the anti-christ
<emangamer> who knew?
<Jim> According to who?
<emangamer> The movie that he starred in
<Jim> "Maybe I actually am the anti-christ?!" http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/203/685/conspiracy-keanu.jpg?1321901003
<Jim> I'm not actualy sure If I've seen that movie, which is it?
<emangamer> devil's advocate
<emangamer> actually i think his incestruious son is the anti-christ but close enough
<emangamer> man this chat is ded
<Jim> It's still early in the day
<Jim> Not that many people are on yet
<Amras0000> Greetings
<Amras0000> I might as well ask again
<Amras0000> will the mare-a-thon be streamed on brony state?
<Jim> ohai Amras0000
<Jim> I think it will, yes.
<MirrorImage> you'd have to ask whoever is streaming that day
<MirrorImage> i think Sumica is the episode streamer?
<emangamer> Well I think I am going to continue to work on coloring in my drawing
<emangamer> hopefully It will look better than my spike one
<Jim> I believe someone said that they would stream it, can't remember who
<Jim> have fun emangamer
<emangamer> this will be my first one where I try to do something origional instead of just copying straight from the show
<DeadpoolDash> sweet I got the Dovahcore helmet in Skyrim
<Jim> The Dovahcore helmet, what's that?
<DeadpoolDash> helmet made from the space core from Portal 2
<Jim> Awesome ^^
<Meanwhile> Afternoon any and everypony.
<dashiee> hello
<Jim> Hi Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Had a feeling it'd be rather uncrowded at this hour.
<Jim> Yeah, usualy is quiet at these times
<Meanwhile> Still, that's fairly irrelevant.
<dashiee> hnnnnnnnng sweetiebelle MUST sing more ^_^
<Meanwhile> So apparently the new episode got leaked because of an Itunes goof?
<Jim> I heard, not goint to watch it though before saturday
<dashiee> i olny heard the song
<Meanwhile> There's a song?
<dashiee> only*
<Meanwhile> My week is looking up.
<dashiee> yup
<dashiee> sweetiebelle singing
<Kammerjunk|Reading> So I was watching some conspiracy theories about Illuminati.
<Kammerjunk|Reading> You have no idea how fun that is.
<Jim> Oh my, I can't wait for the new episode now ^^
<Jim> But I will
<Kammerjunk> You must. YOU MUST!
<Kammerjunk> You must...
<Meanwhile> Conspiracy theories in general are pretty hilarious.
<emangamer> ok I'm back
<emangamer> what'd I miss?
<Kammerjunk> That they are. I especially love the pyramid-eye-dollar-bill one.
<dashiee> i want to watch it now but i dont want to watch it now
<Kammerjunk> dashiee: I know that feel.
<Meanwhile> You missed my dynamic entry.
<dashiee> i did a big mistake listening to that song!!!
<Rainbowjack> just love this song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIPOeXQ793Q&feature=related
<Meanwhile> Just remember to not spoil anything.
<Meanwhile> Or feel the ever present wrath of the banhammer.
<Jim> Fighting is Magic will be great :)
<dashiee> jim :eeyup
<Kammerjunk> Whenever I see the word "banhammer", I can't help of thinking about Doomhammer from the Warcraft universe.
<Rainbowjack> yeah it will be if it also hit the Xbox or the PS 3
<emangamer> Rainbowjack: not very likely
<Scar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDzZH54-nao&feature=channel_video_title
<Meanwhile> Seeing the word Doomhammer made me think about Orgrim Doomhammer from Warcraft.
<Rainbowjack> banhammer AKA HAMER OF DAWN
<Meanwhile> Dat Gray of War referance.
<Scar> kto polaks?
<Rainbowjack> gears of war :P
<Scar> polak
<Hat> There should be a Skyrim mod where you can enchant warhammers to ban NPCs, as in delete them instantly
<Meanwhile> I call it Gray of War because that's one of the only two colours in those games.
<Meanwhile> That and brown.
<emangamer> I think the Banhammer should be renamed to Mjölnir
<Rainbowjack> the Sword of a 1000 bans
<emangamer> all hail the mighty Mjölnir
<Rainbowjack> i laught my ass off when some one showed me the MLP mod for skyrim
<Meanwhile> Yeah but Mjolnir has it's own place in stories.
<Scar> Please rate this music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDzZH54-nao&feature=channel_video_title
<Kammerjunk> So I searched "I Can see Clearly Now" on YouTube.
<emangamer> Meanwhile: and? it can make an even better story here
<Kammerjunk> YouTube: Where every song is by Bob Marley.
<KetaminaDianePie> it clips
<Meanwhile> emangamer: think of something original instead.
<Meanwhile> The only mod I have for Skyrim right now removes the time limit between dragon encounters. It's a lot more fun trying to fight 3 at once.
<Rainbowjack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6XVF81B280&lc=H4v-mUSJALZt5niThuTyyUw6wwy9SJrZ7PgW-KXTx8Q&context=G2e3946dFAAAAAAAAAAA&feature=g-all-c they invaded us NOO!!!
<Rainbowjack> but just shows you that we bronies are just normal PPL
<Kammerjunk> They are.
<emangamer> alright everypony I must
<emangamer> go
<emangamer> bye everyone
*emangamer hugs all of #bronystate
<Kammerjunk> YOU GO!
<Rainbowjack> bywe bye :(
<Kammerjunk> Perfect timing by me.
<Meanwhile> One does not simply care about random..Finnish? Polish? news shows.
<Scar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDzZH54-nao&feature=channel_video_title
<Kammerjunk> Rainbowjack: Dat Brony rapporter.
<Rainbowjack> i saw this on tv
<Meanwhile> You linked that a minute ago Scar
<Kammerjunk> Why did I just capitalise brony?
<Rainbowjack> i was like WTF
<Meanwhile> Well Kammerjunk, you capitalised it because Mushrooms.
<Kammerjunk> BOOKS
<Moshakra> babababababa-she-sheshseshesshe- mamamamamamama
*Meanwhile whaps Moshakra with a newspaper.
<Kammerjunk> "Well, we weren't allowed to film the meetup, so we did it anyway."
<Jim> lol
<Meanwhile> I love that there are 77 people in chat and about 6 that say anything.
<Hat> "My conclusion of today, bronies are much happier than we are really"
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile - such is the way of the IRC
<MirrorImage> few talk, hundreds listen
<Meanwhile> Such is the way or lurkers you mean.
<Kammerjunk> Hey, does anypony know where I can see where Danish lies on the this-language-is-so-goddamn-hard-to-learn scala?
<TOY_PON3> Hey everypony just wanted to drop by and see what's going on.
<Meanwhile> Hide the porn!
<Hat> Hi Toy
<Kammerjunk> TOY_PON3: Oh heus.
<MirrorImage> TOY_PON3 - same as ever
<Kammerjunk> Nothing much. Et tu?
<Meanwhile> Heya TOY_PON3.
<TOY_PON3> Got school :(
<Rainbowjack> going to play some TF2
<Kammerjunk> I like school.
<Jim> ohai TOY_PON3
<Kammerjunk> It has BOOKS.
<Jim> have fun Rainbow-Dash
<Meanwhile> I used to play TF2
<Kammerjunk> I NEED MORE BOOKS.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: But then you took a Huntsman in the knee.
<Rainbowjack> then you took a RAINBOW in the knee?
<Jim> i mean, have fun Rainbowjack
<Meanwhile> Actually I just gradually stopped playing it.
<TOY_PON3> I should go now bye guys lol
<Meanwhile> Bye TOY_PON3
<Kammerjunk> Valê, TOY_PON3. Have fun.
<Jim> bye TOY_PON3
<Kammerjunk> I was going to play TF2 this morning, but then pony.
<Meanwhile> Pony is best excuse.
<Jim> Pony is a valid excuse for anything
<Meanwhile> If I'm ever called for Jury duty that's what I'm going tosay.
<Kammerjunk> I wish one of my teachers was a brony.
<Jim> Haha
<Meanwhile> Did you ask them all Kammer?
<Kammerjunk> I could say that I didn't do my homework over the weekend because the new episodes was out.
<Purple`Prose> Hi everypony
<Kammerjunk> That'd be a lie, of course. Twilight would scold me mentally if I didn't do my homework.
<Meanwhile> Hello Purple`Prose
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Not... as such, no.
<Meanwhile> PResumably they have work emails, send them episode links.
<Jim> I wonder, I will be conscriped to the army this fall, I wonder what they'll say if I say "But I want to stay at home and watch ponies instead!"
<Gumri> Everyone! I bring news thaat yoy may or may not have heard!
<Kammerjunk> I did, however, do essays taking place in Equestria.
<Meanwhile> Leaked episode Gumri?
<Gumri> yah
<Kammerjunk> DO NOT WANT
<Jim> Heard about it, will not watch it before Saturday
<Meanwhile> ^
<Gumri> I'm just about to watch it because otherwise i will run into spoilers.
<Meanwhile> You can't run into spoilers if you stand still.
<Gumri> I don't want to stand still though
<Kammerjunk> But seriously, does anypony know where I can see where Danish lies on the this-language-is-so-goddamn-hard-to-learn scala?
<dashiee> XD
<Meanwhile> You will stand there and you will like it!
<Gumri> No!
*Meanwhile hits Gumri with a moped.
<Gumri> Ima go watch episode naow, bye bye. :3
<dashiee> gumri listen to the song only that what i did will make me wait for 2 days
<dashiee> er 1 day XD
<Meanwhile> I can't wait for the showing on Saturday when every 2nd sentence in mane chat "omg guyz you know the episode was leaked? lolz"
<Kammerjunk> Which is one of the reasons I'm not active in #bronystate or one of the Mane 6 rooms on Saturdays.
<Jim> This is quite interesting, I wonder if there will be as many people in the livestream as usual
<Meanwhile> I wonder if we'll still have the same kind of crowds.
<Kammerjunk> Or BMN, for that matter.
<Meanwhile> Ikr Kammer.
<Kammerjunk> Instead, I go to hide from all you crazy bronies.
<Kammerjunk> You're all oatmeal.
<Meanwhile> Hide.
<Meanwhile> Smooth job.
<dashiee> dnt worry they will all come i am sure
<Meanwhile> Oatmeal is good meal.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, oatmeal is pretty good.
<Kammerjunk> I eat it at mornings.
<MasterBrony> why dont the other rooms work?
<Jim> They are disabled
<Meanwhile> The mane 6 rooms are now only used during Mane Showings.
<Jim> They only work during the Saturday streams now
<MasterBrony> why?
<Jim> Something about not having enough mods
<dashiee> cause they lack mods
<MasterBrony> oh.....ok
<MasterBrony> :)
<Kammerjunk> So my friend apparently turned into a conspiracy looney.
<Kammerjunk> The lunatic is on the grass...
*dashiee crys what shall i do to stay away from the episode till saturday?
<Kammerjunk> dashiee: Live under a rock.
*Meanwhile hands dashiee a ball on a string.
<Kammerjunk> It's cozy. You'll like it.
<Meanwhile> Play with this.
<dashiee> i think i'll go finish my homework :|
<Kammerjunk> Did mine already.
<Jim> Good luck
<Meanwhile> I suddenly realised I haven't eaten all day.
<dashiee> meanwhile : XD
<Meanwhile> I GO. -Briefly, to aquire consumables.
<Kammerjunk> You shall abscond!
<Kammerjunk> Apparently, I still have an essay to do.
<Kammerjunk> So I'm going to play some TF2.
<Jim> That's the spirit!
<Kammerjunk> I'm not really concerned. It's just an essay, I don't even spend half a day on those, and I still get what amounts to an A+ in the word scale.
<Kammerjunk> letter scale*, even.
<Meanwhile> The amount of food I have has been...increased I suppose since double nothing is still nothing >_>
<Kammerjunk> So I'm probably going to protest against ACTA the 25th.
<Kammerjunk> I love protesting.
<Meanwhile> There's a protest for that now?
<Kammerjunk> It warms the cockles of my heart.
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, plenty of them.
<Meanwhile> I was just going to wait for it to pass and then join the inevitable civil war that'd follow.
<Kammerjunk> That sounds like fun, but I don't have any guns.
<Meanwhile> Implying I do?
<Kammerjunk> Well, civil wars are no fun without guns.
<Meanwhile> Untrue, think of the room for creativity.
<Kammerjunk> ...Arson?
<Meanwhile> -_-
<Kammerjunk> What?
<Meanwhile> You are the least imaginative person ever.
<Kammerjunk> I hear that a lot.
<Meanwhile> :P
<Kammerjunk> But I do love the smell of gunpowder in the morning.
<Meanwhile> Oh what the fudge!
<Meanwhile> That display driver update moved all my desktop icons! That bastard!
<Kammerjunk> I know that feel, man.
<Kammerjunk> Happens to me every time I go to a LAN party with my desktop computer.
<Meanwhile> It's sacred god damnit.
<Kammerjunk> It's all because of my two screens.
<Thunderpony> I wanna duel someone here
<Meanwhile> You just don't move someones icons.
<Thunderpony> Do ponies know how to duel?
<Meanwhile> With a rapier?
<Thunderpony> With a childrens card game
<Purple`Prose> In my headcanon, Luna fences
<Purple`Prose> is that close enough?
<Meanwhile> Oh, no. I gave my card game collection to a charity shop.
<Thunderpony> Does she look like gagaga girl?
<Meanwhile> 3 God cards included.
<Thunderpony> God cards are shucks
<Thunderpony> Shmucks*
<Meanwhile> Also hilariously OP.
<Purple`Prose> are for shmucks* ?
<Thunderpony> Not really
<Thunderpony> They kinda died after the season they arrived
<Meanwhile> But still. I stopped caring about card games around the time GX came out.
<Thunderpony> Then you missed all the good cards
<Purple`Prose> I never got into Yu-Gi-Oh. I was more of a Magic the Gathering type
<Meanwhile> Your opinion is as irrelevant as it is poor and Irish.
<Thunderpony> I forget the name but there was a card recently added that negates the effects of other monsters, spells and traps as soon as it's summoned.
<Thunderpony> Effectivly opening the god cards to a can a whoop plot
<Thunderpony> Heheh...plot
<Meanwhile> Shut down the wrong window >_>
<Thunderpony> Plot
<Meanwhile> Speaking of plot, Pulp Fiction is rather confusing.
<Meanwhile> Grimdark, no ty.
<Thunderpony> Right, i run ninjas now.
<Thunderpony> NINJAS!
<brony4life> the hell?
<Thunderpony> YGO
<Thunderpony> I'm talking about it
*Jim is watching Friendship is Witchcraft
<Thunderpony> NINJAS
<MirrorImage> so has anyone else seen the Skyrim Game Jam video?
<Jim> I have not
<MirrorImage> k, after the game was finished, the devs were basically given 1 week and told "do whatever you want, but add it to Skyrim"
<MirrorImage> just proof of concept stuff...
<MirrorImage> not sure if want... http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=AYOFLqItuW4#t=272s
<Cypresswolf> Im kinda afraid to click youtube links at the moment
<alexxm> did i miss much
<brony4life> Cypresswolf: why?
<MirrorImage> brony4life - this week's episode got leaked
<Jim> There's a leaked episode, do not want
<MirrorImage> spoilers abound
<xcanox> Rarity. Is. A. LADY.
<Thunderpony> I already watched the episode
<Thunderpony> Not the best
<Thunderpony> But ok
<MirrorImage> well many of us haven't
<Thunderpony> Not from what i saw...
<Cypresswolf> heard about the leak. dont want spoilers.
<Cypresswolf> Infact, dont even visit the post about the leak!
<Thunderpony> It's on youtube already, about 67 percent of the fanbase should have seen it by now
<Thunderpony> And i think the post on EQD was deleted
<Cypresswolf> I havent & I wont until it officaily airs saturday
<brony4life> is it an entire episode or is it juslt like one scene?
<MirrorImage> the only post on EQD i noticed about it was "Yes, we know there was a leak. No, we're not going to talk about it. Shut up."
<Cypresswolf> on ED right now, and its still there
<MirrorImage> yeah, that post is still there too
<Thunderpony> Entire ep
<brony4life> oh
<brony4life> i can wait till it airs
<MirrorImage> yeah, it got on iTunes yesterday somehow
<Cypresswolf> the whole 22 minutes...I ddint watch any of it, just checked to varify truth
<Thunderpony> They did it
<MirrorImage> and i'm sure there's a version or two floating around youtube
<Thunderpony> They may claim accident, but i call crap.
<Thunderpony> I feel they did that on purpose
<MirrorImage> evidently The Last Roundup isn't on iTunes atm, so people think that somehow they released this episode by accident instead of TLR
<Thunderpony> I would have thought they wouldn't post that due to the whole derpy thing
<dashiee> is it still on itunes or did they remove it?
<MirrorImage> if derpy goes away, Hasbro is going to lose a lot more customers than they would appease by changing it
<brony4life> people that hate on derpy must die
<Tovler|Self-Loathing> Well… (nope. no spoilers)
<alexxm> is anyone streaming
<Jim> oh my MirrorImage, all those things would be so epic in skyrim!
<Jim> I think not alexxm
<alexxm> ok thanks Jim
<brony4life> oh shit i got a midterm today
<brony4life> DX
<Cypresswolf> I still dont see what the fuss is about over Derpy. The voice was a derp, true, but that's all about her character. Her eyes were an animation mistake and look at what came of that
<DaniilScit|DWARF> New episode is epic
<brony4life> Derpy is the brony contribution to the show I doubt they'll get rid of her
<Rainbowjack> BB all
<Cypresswolf> All the episodes are epic!
<Cypresswolf> Some episodes are more epic than others!
<Jim> bye Rainbow-Dash
<Jim> gawd, tab fail
<Jim> bye rainbowjack
<alexxm> byr rainbow jack

<prince-dari> derring-do*
<Globetrotter> Daring Do is right though?
<Globetrotter> The real word is
<Globetrotter> but this is a play on words
<prince-dari> It's still wrong, because it's meant to be the real word.
<Globetrotter> Like, I'm going to clap your sock
<prince-dari> Daring-do is what people say when they get derring-do wrong.
<Yellowquiet> ok back same question again what kind of music do you like ?
<Globetrotter> Okay then
<prince-dari> It's not a play on words, real word derring-do already means brave feats.

<Dken2021> I remember Grant Imahara showed up at the college I went to, but I didn't get to see him :(
<Globetrotter> Dark_Horts, that is an amazing idea.

<Epona> When I die, I don't want a funeral.
<ofna01> why?
<Epona> I want to be butchered into pieces, put into a plastic bag, and thrown out of a car window.
<Shy> I don't like thinking about dying ... I will just let it happen when it happens
<ofna01> then what do you want done with you,throw out in the yard?

<Epona> dashiee: I'm just a troll, don't take anything I say as fact. lol
<Globetrotter> Why did you change Shy?
<Sundaysmile> lol
<Shy> XD haha
<Shy> oh, too much 'work drama' I guess you would call it, worry not
<Epona> Shy: Do you know who I am?

<Epona> I'm xcanox. =D
<Shy> oh!

<Shy> I was the one who brought you in here to begin with then XD
<xcanox> Pinged myself. :3
<ofna01> LOL
<alexxm> dat zombie woman
<Shy> :3
<Shadowmere> Don't forget to take your medicine or the blue whale will steal your salad...
<Sundaysmile> trolling existed in the 1800's
<Sundaysmile> myth busted
<Epona> Trolling exsisted since the beginning of time.
<TrixieMuffin> they are way overblowing that , in an enclosed space like that , what you can suffocate on is CO2, that isnt sudden blackout , you have time to react if the oxigen gets thin .
<Shy> Epona, I have five different accounts, all with different vhosts :3
<alexxm> trolling is as old as time itself Sundaysmile
<Sundaysmile> ineed
<Sundaysmile> indeed*
<Dark_Horst> or if, you know, his head lies 3 metres apart from his body
<Epona> When cavemen used to club each other to death, that was prehistoric trolling.
<Shadowmere> *crack* HaH!
<Sundaysmile> he sounds nervous...
<pony_597> that dress is strange
<ofna01> beeeeeeep
<ofna01> LOL
<Epona> DUDE! I'M ALIVE!
<Dark_Horst> oh aficans, you so silly
<ofna01> she believes in zombies?
<Sundaysmile> AIM FOR THE HEAD
<ofna01> : D
<ofna01> i have a zombie plan
<Dark_Horst> there's a lot of myth material about zombies in voodoo
<Shadowmere> I believe in zombies
<Dark_Horst> and voodoo comes from africa
<Jim> I hate it when people dump dirt on my front yard
<Epona> People do that Jim?
<pony_597> jesus is a zombie, and a lot of people blindly believe in him
<alexxm> sorry bout the Jim
<Jim> Not really ^^
<ofna01> my zombie plan is to go to a deserted island,and hunt the wildlife for food
<Dark_Horst> so the poor superstitious countryfolk there might believ ein zombies
<Sundaysmile> Mine is head to a nearby prison
<Epona> ofna01: You'll be arrested for tresspassing.
<ofna01> DESERTED epona
<Shy> oh gosh, just watching this ep of mythbuster's is making my chest tighten up ;~;
<ofna01> noone owns it
<Epona> The way the system works, if you don't fight the first week of the apocalypse, you'll be screwed over.
<Epona> You gotta fight first, then survive.
<ofna01> nope
<alexxm> how about having mick foley as the penguin
<Shadowmere> 6_9 ooo...hope he freaks its funny when people freak out about this stuff
<Jim> I can feel my claustrophobia attacking me just by watching this
<ofna01> yeah
<Epona> I'm not a claustrophobic.
<Sundaysmile> remember kids, you don't have to outrun the zombies just the guy next to you
<ofna01> its gettin hard for me to breath sorta
<Dark_Horst> jamie there sure has some balls. i would freak the fuck out in there
<Shy> ^
<ofna01> i dont even like going in caves
<Epona> We love Fluttershy!
<alexxm> same here dark
<ofna01> Epona
<Epona> ofna01
<ofna01> if zombie apocalypse comes,i'll bring the food
<ofna01> XD
<Sundaysmile> smores!
<Shadowmere> Bronies shall survive the Zombie Apocolypse!!
<ofna01> yes
<Jim> Think I got claustrophobia from my brother pushing me into a coffin-like chest and sitting on it for five minutes
<Shadowmere> :D
<Epona> You have to subtract the amount of time it takes the government to realize there is an apocalypse from your survival time.
<ofna01> with the orbital friendship cannon
<Shadowmere> Hell yea!
<alexxm> well good to know we'll be in charge of rebuliding soicety
<ofna01> a society of ponies
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello everypony

<LunaTheBeloved> I'm only on for about 30 minutes, then I gots work to go to
<Dken2021> kay-o
<TrixieMuffin> that was a failed attempt , i am disapoint if they leve it at that
<Sundaysmile> But then there will be war over who is the deity to follow. Celestia or Luna
<alexxm> why not both
<Shadowmere> :D
<Vivix> Oh hi mythbusters

<Dken2021> it's more fun to watch here anyway
<unfoundbug> so, skyrim

<Shadowmere> time on this site and watching it
<Sundaysmile> 5000+ viewers
<Vivix> The stream usually gets 4500 viewers
<MirrorImage> pony_597 - stream easily gets 4000+
<Epona> I swear to god if you start a Skyrim conversation, ooh boy I'll hit you so hard that by the time you come to, you're gonna need a new haircut!
<Ponygirl82> I'm bored so i thought I'd come hang out with some cool bronies :)
<Jim> But people are divided into 7 rooms
<MirrorImage> the chat room normally goes 2000+
<Dken2021> oh welcome newcomer
<unfoundbug> the others hit another 2.5k at least
<MirrorImage> Jim - yes, but all 6 of the Pony Chats also load up the BronyState channel
<unfoundbug> id say nearing 10-15k bronies watch the streasm in all
<Epona> I remember this one!!
<Shadowmere> DAMN!
<Vivix> The view is total amount, not per c hannel
<Jim> That's true
<Epona> Buster loses his legs in the water. :D
<Sundaysmile> that's if you combine all streams together?
<Shadowmere> i would expect
<Jim> Then we would have a ton of bronies
<unfoundbug> the chats would just be silly ad over crowded as well
<Shadowmere> who is going to be on tomorrow night?
<Dken2021> yea it gets chaotic here on saturdays
<unfoundbug> should of seen the explosion when derpy got named and spoke

<Sundaysmile> I kinda lol'd
<Jim> Cracked his metal skull o_O
<Dark_Horst> concrete is mean stuff
<pony_597> i'm glad bone is stronger than metal
<Shadowmere> metal vs concrete concrete wins
<Vivix> why is the ad a girl arching her back and a facebook like button?
<Jim> Faceplanting from that height would probably ruin your day anyhow.
<ofna01> herro
<Dken2021> get adblock, it will ease yor life a little
<pony_597> you see ads?
<Kencolt> Well, to be fair, Buster has been tyhrough a LOT by this point.
<Vivix> on mips yeah
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWtDwQqKMBE
<Vivix> I dont mind ads, I thought that ad was weird. Cause it had noo text..
<Ponygirl82> This is my first ep of Mythbusters, I don't have cable so I don't see it over here sadly :C. It looks fun
<Dken2021> lali-ho ofna01
<Dark_Horst> he had to be completely replaced at one point, i think
<Vivix> Mythbusters is great fun
<MirrorImage> gotta test that head weld
<Sundaysmile> Was almost a series and a half before buster mk II stepped on the scene
<Epona> pony_597: lol Really?
<Vivix> yeah buster was completely remodeled at some point
<Sundaysmile> he's a tough lil trooper
<Jim> Diagnosis: Broken skull and shoulder
<Dken2021> yea, I like this show, it get's more fun with grant and kari
<Sundaysmile> I think they blew him up or something and he was unsalvageable
<Epona> Sundaysmile: With the Chinese firework rocket chair!
<MirrorImage> Sundaysmile - i believe that was dropping him from a helicopter at... 2000ft?
<Jim> I forget, was he in the concrete car?
<Vivix> Yyeah but before then
<Epona> I saw that ep last night on TV. :D
<Vivix> they destroyed him and rebuildt a new one and plastered his face on it
<Vivix> Buster 2.0. then almost never used him
<Sundaysmile> he's cackling evilly
<Big_Jakeintosh> Been trying to come up with an OC but I am severly creatively challenged
<Epona> His legs are gonna fly.
<MirrorImage> backflop!
<Kencolt> Well, around Buster 2.0 they discovered frozen trukeys and their areodynamic properties.
<Jim> I don't care what universe you come from, that's gotta hurt!

<Kencolt> So, we have a reasonable result and analysis for dropping a double amputee off a bridge.
<Epona> I am now fear of water.
<Dark_Horst> this makes me thirsty
<Vivix> Hydrophobia vs Hydraphobia
<prince-dari> Some guy jumped off one of the really big bridges a not that long ago and was completely fine.
<Ponygirl82> oh interesting
<Big_Jakeintosh> IVE seen worse
<Epona> Oops. :3
<Vivix> I think if you land correctly, you will be fine
<Dken2021> O U dari
<Epona> Anyway, I am now fear of water.
<prince-dari> No, really.
<prince-dari> I think it was golden gate brige.
<Vivix> how tall is that?
<Vivix> 30-40 meter?
<Vivix> I mean from the jump to water
<Ponygirl82> makes you think twice about drinking coke huh?
<Epona> I don't drink coke.
<Big_Jakeintosh> lol
<Vivix> A few days ago 3 guys fell off a crane in Norway, 35 meters and survived
<Vivix> well, survived so far
<Epona> Here's a little fun fact for ya: it's called "coca cola" because the original recipe contained cocaine.
<Dark_Horst> rolling around on an engine block for science - only a mythbuster can say that he did that today
<unfoundbug> its all about the landing
<Jim> For kids!
<unfoundbug> not the fall
<Vivix> alot of drugs from 1920s used to be brandnames
<Dken2021> snake?

<Big_Jakeintosh> looks like it would just make your engine sticky
<Vivix> wasnt heroine developed as a less addictive cure for something?
<Dark_Horst> isn't that cocaine thing common knowledge?
<otakon> it is to me
<Ponygirl82> probably
<Ponygirl82> its pretty much common sense 'coca' 'cocaine'
<Epona> Cocaine Cola
<Vivix> I always thouht the cocaine was rumour and cocaleafs was the thing
<dashiee> cyall later , I GO!
<Jim> cya dashiee
<Vivix> WE GO
<Dken2021> bye dashiee
<Epona> YOU GO
<Kencolt> Strictly speaking, it wasn't cocaine as such, but an extract from the coca nut. The amount of the active alkaloid was very very small.
<otakon> bye dashiee
<Vivix> Ahh
<Ponygirl82> coke has phosphoric acid in it O_o
<Dark_Horst> well, you make cocaine out of coca leafs
<Vivix> coca leafs and gasoline
<Sundaysmile> and you used to be able to buy it in supermarkets
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> QI said eh carepackages to soldiers in WW1 included heroine, syringes and stuff
<Ponygirl82> coke = basically a bunch of chemicals flavoured with a f-ton of sugar
<Big_Jakeintosh> ewwww

<Simon2> never played GTA before
<Vivix> Oh i havent seen this one
<Simon2> but basically that style
<Vivix> OH wait yes I have
<Yellowquiet1> i know that one ! ^^
<Shadowmere> oh ok
<Epona> He got his tongue pierced. :o
<Morty> ive seen this
<Sundaysmile> yay tesla coil
<Simon2> The mayhems are shit loads of chaos and fun
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Vivix> I didnt want to buy Saints row 3 after testing their character creation demo

<Simon2> dat eyebrow
<Epona> Yay!
<Vivix> IN sr2 I could be a skinny girly guy, in sr3 IMPOSSIBLE
<Ponygirl82> I love shows where they randomly burn shit :D
<Yellowquiet1> Jamie wants big boom XD
<Simon2> Saints Row 3 also contains a bit humor
<Epona> Ponygirl82: Mythbuster's is your kinda stuff.
<Sundaysmile> just be a fat muscly girlman
<Ponygirl82> destruction hurrah
<Shadowmere> me other fav show kinda like this deadliest warrior
<Shadowmere> blood and guts instead of explosions
<Vivix> Yeah, you cant remove all that bodybuilder esque muscle
<Ponygirl82> Yeh it looks fun, too bad it doesn't air over here
<Simon2> and... not sure but... once I heard a radio saying something like "equestrians"
<Epona> As far as I know, it's on here every day. It's always on when I join the stream.
<Epona> :3
<Simon2> It's usually mid-night when streams are active
<Dark_Horst> if it would've been the piercing, it would've hit him in the face
<diddutz> depends on where you lkive Simon2 ^^
<Ponygirl82> cockamamie is an awesome word
<Simon2> GMT+8/EST+13
<Vivix> I would probably buy SR3 if its on sale soon. But I didnt buy sr2 for the story, and dont think I would do that to SR3 either
<Epona> "brouhaha" is a more awesome word.
<prince-dari> I don't think it would increase your chance of getting struck, but it would mean more serious injuries around the area in which the metal is.
<Yellowquiet1> actually the lightning bolt dont goes throu your body its more like it goes around your body
<Sundaysmile> agreed dari
<Simon2> I usually buy retail because I got not much e-cash
<Ponygirl82> it depends if you're mouth is open or not
<Sumica> 00,10rawr
<Yellowquiet1> yes
<Morty> i agree dari...especially since ive seen this one x3
<Yellowquiet1> and if you are sweating
<Ponygirl82> if you're walking around with your tongue out then you're asking for it
<Kencolt> Wok Abuse... I may cry.
<Shadowmere> to survive lightning strike wear your ipod or something it will take the hit for ya but you will have to play another 200 for that ipod
<Sumica> 00,10so I take it the auto play is working well
<Sundaysmile> It's for a good cause colt
<Vivix> best yet: get in car
<Shadowmere> Thank you Manswers
<Epona> Manswers is awesome.
<Epona> I learned alot of stuff from them. :3
<Shadowmere> oh yea it is
<Shadowmere> lets just say it saved my life in my time from the strange questions they answer
<Epona> I learned how to win at beer pong. x3

<Shadowmere> i learned how to win arm wrestling

<Epona> "Body Manipulations"
<Kencolt> Ok. That's going too far.

<Simon2> anyone?
<Jim> Eeyup
<Shadowmere> Fallout had the 30 different endings or wahtever
<Simon2> 30!? WAT
<ScootaChicken> Morty: that sounds unbelievably creepy
<pony_7733> He means variables but it only had 3 types of endings for what you decide to do in the end
<Shadowmere> dpending on how you went through
<Kencolt> Chrono Trigger had 20-something possible endings on newgame+ mode...
<Morty> hahah :P
<Shadowmere> savin the vault or other little things throughout the game
<Epona> Chrono Trigger is a good game.
<Sundaysmile> lightning swings to the right?

<Shadowmere> no talking about that subject
<Epona> If I get struck by lightning and a doorknob flies out of my head, I'll be happy.
<Simon2> Just sayin episode 17, I'm not spoiling anything about it
<Ponygirl82> I wonder why doors don't get hit by lightning every time it storms then?
<Sundaysmile> and now time for infection

<Shadowmere> the mythbusters will be finein a zombie apocolypse they can make anything out of what they find lol
<Sundaysmile> good thing he has no neighbours
<Dark_Horst> his neighbors like his cannons
<Sumica> 00,10did he realy need to wear the blue jumpsuit?
<ofna01> I'm the spark that makes your idea brightThe same sparkthat lights the darkSo that you can know your left from your right.
<Epona> Yes.
<Sundaysmile> he has no other clothes

<Morty> o.O
<Epona> If you start a Skyrim convo, I'll shoot you in the knee with an arrow.
<Ponygirl82> I love medieval siege weapons
<Vivix> I love old crap
<Sumica> 00,10archry, blacksmithing, dont need it 'i'am going to spaaace!
<Morty> never seen such an objection to skyrim
<otakon> HIYA Shizuka!

<Epona> Skyrim is only so good because of the hype.
<Shizuka> 13shhh... nicht so laut
<Jim> Skyrim's gotten space in the new addon thingy
<Epona> I played it, and it's pretty lame.
<otakon> I like Skyrim
<Sumica> 00,10Shizuka! <3
<Vivix> Skyrim is as fun as oblivion was
<Jim> ohai Shizuka
<Big_Jakeintosh> Skyrim? i LOVE Skyrim :)
<Vivix> but it is a bethesda game, so it is far from perfect or modern
<otakon> but it's quickly turning into a kill loot sell game
<ofna01> FUS RO yaaay
<otakon> Vivix: there IS no perfect game
<Vivix> noo but look at the animations and models
<Vivix> bethesda has never been good at modern graphics or animation
<Big_Jakeintosh> I prefer to Role Play and put restrictions onmy character makes it way more fun
<Vivix> but I still love the game
<ofna01> Vivix
<ofna01> the graphics are amazing
<Vivix> nature sure, but the horses and dragons?
<Shadowmere> having every achievement can make it real boring
<Epona> Well guys I'm gonna go. Later bros.
<unfoundbug> Vivix so? A game is supposed to be fun, graphics are nice icing, but the game plays so well doesnt really need them
<Vivix> I know i know
<Jim> Cya Epona
<Big_Jakeintosh> Achievements are meaninglesss
<Vivix> And I doo love the game
<Morty> cya
<unfoundbug> but what it does have is really nice anyway
<DeadpoolDash> Dovahcore Helmet
<Vivix> but bethesda has never made a game where things look alive
<unfoundbug> plus the new texture pack is VERY nice
<unfoundbug> Fair enough, usually they spend too much time dead for me to notice
<Morty> i think i made epona leave with skyrim...
<Big_Jakeintosh> Also steam workshop makes installing mods easy
<Vivix> yeah
<AppleTeeny> hello everypony

<Globetrotter> Hello everypony!
<GamerForevuur> hi , Globetrotter
<Jim> hi Globetrotter
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey Globetrotter!
<moop> any one else having buffering problems?
<GamerForevuur> i do
<Globetrotter> What's everypony up to? I just finished some definite integration.
<GamerForevuur> since the Stream stopped , wh not ask each other (between everypony else) questions?
<Jim> Not much, just watching some youtube
<alexxm> how did u guys become brony's
<TwoTone> Curiosity
<Globetrotter> Lions and tigers, seaturtles, endangered wildlife, lion cubs. You can work with one, which would it be?
<GamerForevuur> well , for me , it all started before i discovered Bronies...
<ofna01> ummm
<Kammerjunk> Well, I frequent /b/, where ponythreads were just beginning to become popular.
<DainbowRash> For me, cupcakes started it all...
<ofna01> my bronization was at Battlefield Hero's forum
<ofna01> they started a huge thread,so i watched an episode,and got hooked
<GamerForevuur> when i discovered Bronies , i was Amazed , Shocked , and Confused
<Globetrotter> I can't quite remember. I saw some bronies on the internet, saw they were happy, watched mlp and it made me happy.
<Jim> A friend of mine showed me the show, and I got hooked!
<GamerForevuur> i watched their memes..
<dashiee> found it on tv XD
<GamerForevuur> i decided to watch 1 Episode
<Globetrotter> Jim, I did that with my mate Rob
<Kammerjunk> Then one sleepless night, I sighed and ate the last chip in the bag as I opened up a new tab. Mentally, I insulted myself for even thinking of doing what I was about to do. And as I clicked on the video link upon YouTube, I was prepared to be disappointed.
<Kammerjunk> Safe to say, I was not.
<Jim> Did he like it, globe?
<TwoTone> I watched the first couple episodes one night while talking to a friend on Facebook chat. By the end of the second or third episode I told my friend on chat "I'm watching ponies, I can't stop. I love it, What's wrong with me".
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PtMPOyWTag&feature=related
<Kammerjunk> I didn't get halfway through the first episode before realising that "Holy bit, this show is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!"
<moop> did any one else just figure out that the voice actor for Pinkie Pie is also Fluttershy's?
<ofna01> did they then tell you about bronies
<DainbowRash> I rmr the first eps. I watched was Hearth's Warming Eve
<Kammerjunk> moop: Known so for a while now.
<HeavyMetalDash> same
<Globetrotter> Jim, at first he was like, "I'm too manly for this! I do karate! This is gay, gay, gay, gay, gay." A few weeks later, "Dude I'm a brony!"
<moop> Kammerjunk im alway late
<Kammerjunk> moop: Usually, so am I.
<Jokuc> :(
<GamerForevuur> when i finished the First 2 , i was like "how could i...how could this happen? why do i love this?! IZ NOT POSSIBLE!!!"
<moop> Like i didn't know about bronies for a while \
<Jokuc> I hate that the new episode has been leaked
<GamerForevuur> then watched more Episodes
<TwoTone> Can anyone else not stand pony puns?
<GamerForevuur> finished Season 1
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3qJA2oBy-0&feature=related
<Jokuc> But I have not watched it yet, I'll watch the new episode on saturday here as usual :)
<meh> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc9JyGK0qCI
<moop> i finish season 1 in one day
<Kammerjunk> You what the worst thing about having frequented /b/ for some years is? It's the void it leaves. After finding this fandom, I have seen a great deal of sad content, pony and otherwise. And yet, I only remember having actually cried at it once. Just recently, I read a series of sad comics. I felt a very brief sting of sadness, but then it was gone. And it pains me, it truly does. But one
<Kammerjunk> can stand a world of pain for the sake of this fandom.
<Jim> I watched the two first episodes with my friend. I acted like I wasn't that impressed by the show at first, but later that night when I got home, I stayed up to 8 am watching the episodes.
<Kammerjunk> So thank you, everypony. This fandom has made my life something I thought it could not be.
<Jim> And I loved it
<Big_Jakeintosh> I became a brony after getting curious about all the MLP stuff going a round at first i thought it was a huge joke or soemthing like the series was really bad and people were making fun of it for that being ironic or whatever then after several pony themed videos on youtube and reading an article on the subject I learned people genuinely loved the show so I figured what the heck lets give it a go so I downloaded th
<Big_Jakeintosh> sorry bout bad typing lol
<meh> if anyones interested hearts and hooves is already on youtube
<MirrorImage> meh, we are quite aware of it, and we are not talking about it
<dashiee> meh : DONT REMIND ME!!!
<TwoTone> Don't watch it!
<meh> too late
<meh> favorite episode ever
<meh> ever
<TwoTone> SHHH!
<moop> Big_Jakeintosh: me too
<MirrorImage> spoilers are still insta-ban meh i believe
<meh> but i wont speak of it
<dashiee> only heard song
<Jim> I don't know about you, but I am waiting till' Saturday
<DainbowRash> I'm scared of the people that will be spamming spoilers.
<meh> i know im not going to say anything
<GamerForevuur> in fact , one day , i don't know why , but my Lil' Bro told my Bigger Bro that i have a Song in my iPod called "Rainbow Factory"
<GamerForevuur> he wanted to know what's it's all about. i told him
<Morty> ... I just came in and what is this?
<GamerForevuur> he saw , at least , 3-5 minutes , and then we stopped it
<dashiee> sharing brony stories
<GamerForevuur> the First Ep
<Morty> oh i like that
<Jim> I made my little brother a brony. He wanted me to play some game with him, and I said: "Fine, if you watch an episode of My Little Pony afterwards."
<Jokuc> I AM NOT going to watch hearts and hooves untill saturday.
<Jim> He got hooked on the show so quickly
<Morty> is hearts and hooves out!?
<Jim> Shush
<ofna01> ya
<Big_Jakeintosh> I already watched new episode couldnt resist
<Morty> O_O
<DainbowRash> I don't know to watch it or not.
<dashiee> jokuc: stop reminding me -.-
<GamerForevuur> a week or a few days later , he told one of his Friends in his Shop that i was a Brony , and what happened was...
<meh> where is everyone?
<Big_Jakeintosh> still gonna be there for the saturday stream
<GamerForevuur> his friend explained to him about Bronies
<GamerForevuur> he also told him that 89% of men are Bronies
<MirrorImage> GamerForevuur - reverse that statistic
<Globetrotter> brb nature calls
<moop> Only REAL men watch MLP FIM
<dashiee> 89% .... ok not rly
<GamerForevuur> wait , what do you mean? that's what my Bro said...
<Morty> you know how some superhumans save sex till marriage to show there love? Im going to show my love for ponies by waiting till saturday
<meh> i think he meant 89% of bronies are men
<MirrorImage> 89% of *bronies* are *men*
<Jim> that's like 2 billion bronies
<MirrorImage> not 89% of *men* are *bronies*
<Jim> ah, that way around
<GamerForevuur> F**k i think your right
<dashiee> XD
<MirrorImage> because my god, if this show had an 89% rating with men world wide...
<GamerForevuur> maybe i heard it wrong...
<moop> Bronism will soon become a religion
<MirrorImage> or even across america...
<Morty> speaking of sex and pony episodes...Is it ok that I get more excited for the new episode than sex?
<MirrorImage> moop - too late
<moop> too late?
<meh> totally normal morty
<Jim> Morty: That's normal
<Morty> good
<ofna01> lol
<GamerForevuur> brb
<meh> only thing that sucks is i cant speak of it till after saturday
<moop> ^
<moop> i just saw it
<unfoundbug> no discussion of leaked ep
<meh> best episode ever
<moop> shhhhhhh
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Everlasting_Joy> meh you're just saying that to yank our chain.
<meh> ^
<unfoundbug> its also in the rules
<moop> its pretty good
<Morty> if my gf took her clothes off, opened her legs and said do me and the new episode was on, i honestly dont know what Id do...i think i would go with sex and watch it later but that would never happen because my gf would be too excited about ponies lol
<Krakass> Does anyone know how it was leakes? Did a ninja pony break in and steal it or something?
<unfoundbug> gf want sex, nah ponies
<moop> Morty: why not have sex while watching MLP FIM?
<Globetrotter> oh unfoundbug, why not both?
<dashiee> it was on itunes by mistake
<unfoundbug> sex while ponies?
<Krakass> Ahh
<unfoundbug> i think that topic is to be avoided
<moop> yep
<HeavyMetalDash> it was an accidental early itunes realese that got took down shortly after
<ofna01> derp
<Kipkat07> HAI EVERYPONY!!!
<alexxm> how do u accidently put something on itunes
<Morty> Moop: it wouldnt work
<Kammerjunk> Three Rings for the Unicorn-kings under the sky, Seven for the Earth-ponies in their farms of stone, Nine for Pegasi, blessed with flight, One for the Dark Queen on her Dark Throne, In the Land of Equestria where the Nightmare lies.
<Kammerjunk> Random LotR because I'm bored.
<GamerForevuur> hi , Kipkat07
<alexxm> hi kipkst
<dashiee> they were trying to put episode 14 insted
<meh> i heard about the mistake yesterday and wondered if it was on youtube and it was and my little sister had just gotten home and pressured me to watching it early
<Kammerjunk> Kipkat07: Salvê.
<Kammerjunk> meh: That sucks.
<meh> worth it
<meh> totally
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<unfoundbug> whut... fansong rewrite of tenacious D involving a rockoff against nightmare moon
<dashiee> my lil sis watched it
<unfoundbug> this is either going to be the best song ever
<unfoundbug> or terrible
<moop> NOW RAINBOW MY DEAR I CAN NOT EXPRESS MY DELIGHT!
<alexxm> i'm just going to wait till it airs to be honest
<Morty> <3
<Kammerjunk> The way I see it, if it's not livestream, it had better be 1080p.
<Morty> ^
<Kammerjunk> I will accept nothing less.
<meh> only 720 the copy i found
<Krakass> Hmm just opened itunes and it's in my download que.
<Krakass> queue
<Globetrotter> Any of you guys listened to Trixie Deos?
<Krakass> queueueueue
<Kammerjunk> QUE
<Cypresswolf> 720 is not worthy!
<Morty> actually i can live with 720, on my hd tv 1080 looks too good if you know what i mean
<meh> yeah
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: No, what's that?
<Kammerjunk> It sounds interesting, with the Trixie and all.
<moop> ITS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT SOM
<Morty> its like, ponies were not meant to be seen with that clarity
<meh> haha
